gambara
by
honore
de
balzac
translated

waring
dedication
to
monsieur
le
marquis
de
belloy
it
was
sitting
by
the
fire
in
a
mysterious
and
magnificent
retreat
now
a
thing
of
the
past
but
surviving
in
our
memory
whence
our
eyes
commanded
a
view
of
paris
from
the
heights
of
belleville
to
those
of
belleville
from
montmartre
to
the
triumphal
arc
de
l
etoile
that
one
morning
refreshed
by
tea
amid
the
myriad
suggestions
that
shoot
up
and
die
like
rockets
from
your
sparkling
flow
of
talk
lavish
of
ideas
you
tossed
to
my
pen
a
figure
worthy
of
hoffmann
that
casket
of
unrecognized
gems
that
pilgrim
seated
at
the
gate
of
paradise
with
ears
to
hear
the
songs
of
the
angels
but
no
longer
a
tongue
to
repeat
them
playing
on
the
ivory
keys
with
fingers
crippled
by
the
stress
of
divine
inspiration
believing
that
he
is
expressing
celestial
music
to
his
bewildered
listeners
it
was
you
who
created
gambara
i
have
only
clothed
him
let
me
render
unto
caesar
the
things
that
are
caesar
s
regretting
only
that
you
do
not
yourself
take
up
the
pen
at
a
time
when
gentlemen
ought
to
wield
it
as
well
as
the
sword
if
they
are
to
save
their
country
you
may
neglect
yourself
but
you
owe
your
talents
to
us
gambara
new
year
s
day
of
was
pouring
out
its
packets
of
sugared
almonds
four
o
clock
was
striking
there
was
a
mob
in
the
and
the
were
beginning
to
fill
at
this
moment
a
coupe
drew
up
at
the
and
a
young
man
stepped
out
a
man
of
haughty
appearance
and
no
doubt
a
foreigner
otherwise
he
would
not
have
displayed
the
aristocratic
who
attended
him
in
a
plumed
hat
nor
the
coat
of
arms
which
the
heroes
of
july
still
attacked
this
gentleman
went
into
the
and
followed
the
crowd
round
the
galleries
unamazed
at
the
slowness
to
which
the
throng
of
loungers
reduced
his
pace
he
seemed
accustomed
to
the
stately
step
which
is
ironically
nicknamed
the
ambassador
s
strut
still
his
dignity
had
a
touch
of
the
theatrical
though
his
features
were
handsome
and
imposing
his
hat
from
beneath
which
thick
black
curls
stood
out
was
perhaps
tilted
a
little
too
much
over
the
right
ear
and
belied
his
gravity
by
a
too
rakish
effect
his
eyes
inattentive
and
half
closed
looked
down
disdainfully
on
the
crowd
there
goes
a
remarkably
young
man
said
a
girl
in
a
low
voice
as
she
made
way
for
him
to
pass
and
who
is
only
too
well
aware
of
it
replied
her
companion
aloud
who
was
very
plain
after
walking
all
round
the
arcades
the
young
man
looked
by
turns
at
the
sky
and
at
his
watch
and
with
a
shrug
of
impatience
went
into
a
tobacconist
s
shop
lighted
a
cigar
and
placed
himself
in
front
of
a
to
glance
at
his
costume
which
was
rather
more
ornate
than
the
rules
of
french
taste
allow
he
pulled
down
his
collar
and
his
black
velvet
waistcoat
over
which
hung
many
festoons
of
the
thick
gold
chain
that
is
made
at
venice
then
having
arranged
the
folds
of
his
cloak
by
a
single
jerk
of
his
left
shoulder
draping
it
gracefully
so
as
to
show
the
velvet
lining
he
started
again
on
parade
indifferent
to
the
glances
of
the
vulgar
as
soon
as
the
shops
were
lighted
up
and
the
dusk
seemed
to
him
black
enough
he
went
out
into
the
square
in
front
of
the
but
as
a
man
anxious
not
to
be
recognized
for
he
kept
close
under
the
houses
as
far
as
the
fountain
screened
by
the
stand
till
he
reached
the
rue
a
dirty
poky
disreputable
street
a
sort
of
sewer
tolerated
by
the
police
close
to
the
purified
purlieus
of
the
as
an
italian
allows
a
careless
servant
to
leave
the
sweepings
of
the
rooms
in
a
corner
of
the
staircase
the
young
man
hesitated
he
might
have
been
a
bedizened
citizen
s
wife
craning
her
neck
over
a
gutter
swollen
by
the
rain
but
the
hour
was
not
unpropitious
for
the
indulgence
of
some
discreditable
whim
earlier
he
might
have
been
detected
later
he
might
find
himself
cut
out
tempted
by
a
glance
which
is
encouraging
without
being
inviting
to
have
followed
a
young
and
pretty
woman
for
an
hour
or
perhaps
for
a
day
thinking
of
her
as
a
divinity
and
excusing
her
light
conduct
by
a
thousand
reasons
to
her
advantage
to
have
allowed
oneself
to
believe
in
a
sudden
and
irresistible
affinity
to
have
pictured
under
the
promptings
of
transient
excitement
a
in
an
age
when
romances
are
written
precisely
because
they
never
happen
to
have
dreamed
of
balconies
guitars
stratagems
and
bolts
enwrapped
in
almaviva
s
cloak
and
after
inditing
a
poem
in
fancy
to
stop
at
the
door
of
a
house
of
and
crowning
all
to
discern
in
rosina
s
bashfulness
a
reticence
imposed
by
the
police
is
not
all
this
i
say
an
experience
familiar
to
many
a
man
who
would
not
own
it
the
most
natural
feelings
are
those
we
are
least
willing
to
confess
and
among
them
is
fatuity
when
the
lesson
is
carried
no
further
the
parisian
profits
by
it
or
forgets
it
and
no
great
harm
is
done
but
this
would
hardly
be
the
case
with
this
foreigner
who
was
beginning
to
think
he
might
pay
too
dearly
for
his
paris
education
this
personage
was
a
milanese
of
good
family
exiled
from
his
native
country
where
some
liberal
pranks
had
made
him
an
object
of
suspicion
to
the
austrian
government
count
andrea
marcosini
had
been
welcomed
in
paris
with
the
cordiality
essentially
french
that
a
man
always
finds
there
when
he
has
a
pleasant
wit
a
sounding
name
two
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
and
a
prepossessing
person
to
such
a
man
banishment
could
but
be
a
pleasure
tour
his
property
was
simply
sequestrated
and
his
friends
let
him
know
that
after
an
absence
of
two
years
he
might
return
to
his
native
land
without
danger
after
rhyming
with
miei
in
a
dozen
or
so
of
sonnets
and
maintaining
as
many
hapless
italian
refugees
out
of
his
own
purse
count
andrea
who
was
so
unlucky
as
to
be
a
poet
thought
himself
released
from
patriotic
obligations
so
ever
since
his
arrival
he
had
given
himself
up
recklessly
to
the
pleasures
of
every
kind
which
paris
offers
to
those
who
can
pay
for
them
his
talents
and
his
handsome
person
won
him
success
among
women
whom
he
adored
collectively
as
beseemed
his
years
but
among
whom
he
had
not
as
yet
distinguished
a
chosen
one
and
indeed
this
taste
was
in
him
subordinate
to
those
for
music
and
poetry
which
he
had
cultivated
from
his
childhood
and
he
thought
success
in
these
both
more
difficult
and
more
glorious
to
achieve
than
in
affairs
of
gallantry
since
nature
had
not
inflicted
on
him
the
obstacles
men
take
most
pride
in
defying
a
man
like
many
another
of
complex
nature
he
was
easily
fascinated
by
the
comfort
of
luxury
without
which
he
could
hardly
have
lived
and
in
the
same
way
he
clung
to
the
social
distinctions
which
his
principles
contemned
thus
his
theories
as
an
artist
a
thinker
and
a
poet
were
in
frequent
antagonism
with
his
tastes
his
feelings
and
his
habits
as
a
man
of
rank
and
wealth
but
he
comforted
himself
for
his
inconsistencies
by
recognizing
them
in
many
parisians
like
himself
liberal
by
policy
and
aristocrats
by
nature
hence
it
was
not
without
some
uneasiness
that
he
found
himself
on
december
under
a
paris
thaw
following
at
the
heels
of
a
woman
whose
dress
betrayed
the
most
abject
inveterate
and
poverty
who
was
no
handsomer
than
a
hundred
others
to
be
seen
any
evening
at
the
play
at
the
opera
in
the
world
of
fashion
and
who
was
certainly
not
so
young
as
madame
de
manerville
from
whom
he
had
obtained
an
assignation
for
that
very
day
and
who
was
perhaps
waiting
for
him
at
that
very
hour
but
in
the
glance
at
once
tender
and
wild
swift
and
deep
which
that
woman
s
black
eyes
had
shot
at
him
by
stealth
there
was
such
a
world
of
buried
sorrows
and
promised
joys
and
she
had
colored
so
fiercely
when
on
coming
out
of
a
shop
where
she
had
lingered
a
quarter
of
an
hour
her
look
frankly
met
the
count
s
who
had
been
waiting
for
her
hard
by
in
fact
there
were
so
many
and
that
possessed
by
one
of
those
mad
temptations
for
which
there
is
no
word
in
any
language
not
even
in
that
of
the
orgy
he
had
set
out
in
pursuit
of
this
woman
hunting
her
down
like
a
hardened
parisian
on
the
way
whether
he
kept
behind
or
ahead
of
this
damsel
he
studied
every
detail
of
her
person
and
her
dress
hoping
to
dislodge
the
insane
and
ridiculous
fancy
that
had
taken
up
an
abode
in
his
brain
but
he
presently
found
in
his
examination
a
keener
pleasure
than
he
had
felt
only
the
day
before
in
gazing
at
the
perfect
shape
of
a
woman
he
loved
as
she
took
her
bath
now
and
again
the
unknown
fair
bending
her
head
gave
him
a
look
like
that
of
a
kid
tethered
with
its
head
to
the
ground
and
finding
herself
still
the
object
of
his
pursuit
she
hurried
on
as
if
to
fly
nevertheless
each
time
that
a
block
of
carriages
or
any
other
delay
brought
andrea
to
her
side
he
saw
her
turn
away
from
his
gaze
without
any
signs
of
annoyance
these
signals
of
restrained
feelings
spurred
the
frenzied
dreams
that
had
run
away
with
him
and
he
gave
them
the
rein
as
far
as
the
rue
down
which
after
many
windings
the
damsel
vanished
thinking
she
had
thus
spoilt
the
scent
of
her
pursuer
who
was
in
fact
startled
by
this
move
it
was
now
quite
dark
two
women
tattooed
with
rouge
who
were
drinking
liqueur
at
a
grocer
s
counter
saw
the
young
woman
and
called
her
she
paused
at
the
door
of
the
shop
replied
in
a
few
soft
words
to
the
cordial
greeting
offered
her
and
went
on
her
way
andrea
who
was
behind
her
saw
her
turn
into
one
of
the
darkest
yards
out
of
this
street
of
which
he
did
not
know
the
name
the
repulsive
appearance
of
the
house
where
the
heroine
of
his
romance
had
been
swallowed
up
made
him
feel
sick
he
drew
back
a
step
to
study
the
neighborhood
and
finding
an
man
at
his
elbow
he
asked
him
for
information
the
man
who
held
a
knotted
stick
in
his
right
hand
placed
the
left
on
his
hip
and
replied
in
a
single
word
scoundrel
but
on
looking
at
the
italian
who
stood
in
the
light
of
a
he
assumed
a
servile
expression
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
he
suddenly
changing
his
tone
there
is
a
restaurant
near
this
a
sort
of
hote
where
the
cooking
is
pretty
bad
and
they
serve
cheese
in
the
soup
monsieur
is
in
search
of
the
place
perhaps
for
it
is
easy
to
see
that
he
is
an
italian
italians
are
fond
of
velvet
and
of
cheese
but
if
monsieur
would
like
to
know
of
a
better
an
aunt
of
mine
who
lives
a
few
steps
off
is
very
fond
of
andrea
raised
his
cloak
as
high
as
his
moustache
and
fled
from
the
street
spurred
by
the
disgust
he
felt
at
this
foul
person
whose
clothes
and
manner
were
in
harmony
with
the
squalid
house
into
which
the
fair
unknown
had
vanished
he
returned
with
rapture
to
the
thousand
luxuries
of
his
own
rooms
and
spent
the
evening
at
the
marquise
d
espard
s
to
cleanse
himself
if
possible
of
the
smirch
left
by
the
fancy
that
had
driven
him
so
relentlessly
during
the
day
and
yet
when
he
was
in
bed
the
vision
came
back
to
him
but
clearer
and
brighter
than
the
reality
the
girl
was
walking
in
front
of
him
now
and
again
as
she
stepped
across
a
gutter
her
skirts
revealed
a
round
calf
her
shapely
hips
swayed
as
she
walked
again
andrea
longed
to
speak
to
her
and
he
dared
not
he
marcosini
a
milanese
nobleman
then
he
saw
her
turn
into
the
dark
passage
where
she
had
eluded
him
and
blamed
himself
for
not
having
followed
her
for
after
all
said
he
to
himself
if
she
really
wished
to
avoid
me
and
put
me
off
her
track
it
is
because
she
loves
me
with
women
of
that
stamp
coyness
is
a
proof
of
love
well
if
i
had
carried
the
adventure
any
further
it
would
perhaps
have
ended
in
disgust
i
will
sleep
in
the
count
was
in
the
habit
of
analyzing
his
keenest
sensations
as
men
do
involuntarily
when
they
have
as
much
brains
as
heart
and
he
was
surprised
when
he
saw
the
strange
damsel
of
the
rue
once
more
not
in
the
pictured
splendor
of
his
dream
but
in
the
bare
reality
of
dreary
fact
and
in
spite
of
it
all
if
fancy
had
stripped
the
woman
of
her
livery
of
misery
it
would
have
spoilt
her
for
him
for
he
wanted
her
he
longed
for
her
he
loved
her
with
her
muddy
stockings
her
slipshod
feet
her
straw
bonnet
he
wanted
her
in
the
very
house
where
he
had
seen
her
go
in
am
i
bewitched
by
vice
then
he
asked
himself
in
dismay
nay
i
have
not
yet
reached
that
point
i
am
but
and
there
is
nothing
of
the
senile
fop
about
the
very
vehemence
of
the
whim
that
held
possession
of
him
to
some
extent
reassured
him
this
strange
struggle
these
reflections
and
this
love
in
pursuit
may
perhaps
puzzle
some
persons
who
are
accustomed
to
the
ways
of
paris
life
but
they
may
be
reminded
that
count
andrea
marcosini
was
not
a
frenchman
brought
up
by
two
abbes
who
in
obedience
to
a
very
pious
father
had
rarely
let
him
out
of
their
sight
andrea
had
not
fallen
in
love
with
a
cousin
at
the
age
of
eleven
or
seduced
his
mother
s
maid
by
the
time
he
was
twelve
he
had
not
studied
at
school
where
a
lad
does
not
learn
only
or
best
the
subjects
prescribed
by
the
state
he
had
lived
in
paris
but
a
few
years
and
he
was
still
open
to
those
sudden
but
deep
impressions
against
which
french
education
and
manners
are
so
strong
a
protection
in
southern
lands
a
great
passion
is
often
born
of
a
glance
a
gentleman
of
gascony
who
had
tempered
strong
feelings
by
much
reflection
had
fortified
himself
by
many
little
recipes
against
sudden
apoplexies
of
taste
and
heart
and
he
advised
the
count
to
indulge
at
least
once
a
month
in
a
wild
orgy
to
avert
those
storms
of
the
soul
which
but
for
such
precautions
are
apt
to
break
out
at
inappropriate
moments
andrea
now
remembered
this
advice
well
thought
he
i
will
begin
january
this
explains
why
count
andrea
marcosini
hovered
so
shyly
before
turning
down
the
rue
the
man
of
fashion
hampered
the
lover
and
he
hesitated
for
some
time
but
after
a
final
appeal
to
his
courage
he
went
on
with
a
firm
step
as
far
as
the
house
which
he
recognized
without
difficulty
there
he
stopped
once
more
was
the
woman
really
what
he
fancied
her
was
he
not
on
the
verge
of
some
false
move
at
this
juncture
he
remembered
the
italian
table
d
hote
and
at
once
jumped
at
the
middle
course
which
would
serve
the
ends
alike
of
his
curiosity
and
of
his
reputation
he
went
in
to
dine
and
made
his
way
down
the
passage
at
the
bottom
after
feeling
about
for
some
time
he
found
a
staircase
with
damp
slippery
steps
such
as
to
an
italian
nobleman
could
only
seem
a
ladder
invited
to
the
first
floor
by
the
glimmer
of
a
lamp
and
a
strong
smell
of
cooking
he
pushed
a
door
which
stood
ajar
and
saw
a
room
dingy
with
dirt
and
smoke
where
a
wench
was
busy
laying
a
table
for
about
twenty
customers
none
of
the
guests
had
yet
arrived
after
looking
round
the
dimly
lighted
room
where
the
paper
was
dropping
in
rags
from
the
walls
the
gentleman
seated
himself
by
a
stove
which
was
roaring
and
smoking
in
the
corner
attracted
by
the
noise
the
count
made
in
coming
in
and
disposing
of
his
cloak
the
presently
appeared
picture
to
yourself
a
lean
cook
very
tall
with
a
nose
of
extravagant
dimensions
casting
about
him
from
time
to
time
with
feverish
keenness
a
glance
that
he
meant
to
be
cautious
on
seeing
andrea
whose
attire
bespoke
considerable
affluence
signor
giardini
bowed
respectfully
the
count
expressed
his
intention
of
taking
his
meals
as
a
rule
in
the
society
of
some
of
his
he
paid
in
advance
for
a
certain
number
of
tickets
and
ingenuously
gave
the
conversation
a
familiar
bent
to
enable
him
to
achieve
his
purpose
quickly
hardly
had
he
mentioned
the
woman
he
was
seeking
when
signor
giardini
with
a
grotesque
shrug
looked
knowingly
at
his
customer
a
bland
smile
on
his
lips
he
exclaimed
your
excellency
has
come
spurred
by
two
appetites
la
signora
gambara
will
not
have
wasted
her
time
if
she
has
gained
the
interest
of
a
gentleman
so
generous
as
you
appear
to
be
i
can
tell
you
in
a
few
words
all
we
know
of
the
woman
who
is
really
to
be
pitied
the
husband
is
i
believe
a
native
of
cremona
and
has
just
come
here
from
germany
he
was
hoping
to
get
the
tedeschi
to
try
some
new
music
and
some
new
instruments
isn
t
it
pitiable
said
giardini
shrugging
his
shoulders
signor
gambara
who
thinks
himself
a
great
composer
does
not
seem
to
me
very
clever
in
other
ways
an
excellent
fellow
with
some
sense
and
wit
and
sometimes
very
agreeable
especially
when
he
has
had
a
few
glasses
of
wine
which
does
not
often
happen
for
he
is
desperately
poor
night
and
day
he
toils
at
imaginary
symphonies
and
operas
instead
of
trying
to
earn
an
honest
living
his
poor
wife
is
reduced
to
working
for
all
sorts
of
people
the
women
on
the
streets
what
is
to
be
said
she
loves
her
husband
like
a
father
and
takes
care
of
him
like
a
child
many
a
young
man
has
dined
here
to
pay
his
court
to
madame
but
not
one
has
succeeded
said
he
emphasizing
the
word
la
signora
marianna
is
an
honest
woman
monsieur
much
too
honest
worse
luck
for
her
men
give
nothing
for
nothing
nowadays
so
the
poor
soul
will
die
in
harness
and
do
you
suppose
that
her
husband
rewards
her
for
her
devotion
pooh
my
lord
never
gives
her
a
smile
and
all
their
cooking
is
done
at
the
baker
s
for
not
only
does
the
wretched
man
never
earn
a
sou
he
spends
all
his
wife
can
make
on
instruments
which
he
carves
and
lengthens
and
shortens
and
sets
up
and
takes
to
pieces
again
till
they
produce
sounds
that
will
scare
a
cat
then
he
is
happy
and
yet
you
will
find
him
the
mildest
the
gentlest
of
men
and
he
is
not
idle
he
is
always
at
it
what
is
to
be
said
he
is
crazy
and
does
not
know
his
business
i
have
seen
him
monsieur
filing
and
forging
his
instruments
and
eating
black
bread
with
an
appetite
that
i
envied
him
i
who
have
the
best
table
in
paris
yes
excellenza
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
you
shall
know
the
man
i
am
i
have
introduced
certain
refinements
into
italian
cookery
that
will
amaze
you
excellenza
i
am
a
neapolitan
that
is
to
say
a
born
cook
but
of
what
use
is
instinct
without
knowledge
knowledge
i
have
spent
thirty
years
in
acquiring
it
and
you
see
where
it
has
left
me
my
history
is
that
of
every
man
of
talent
my
attempts
my
experiments
have
ruined
three
restaurants
in
succession
at
naples
parma
and
rome
to
this
day
when
i
am
reduced
to
make
a
trade
of
my
art
i
more
often
than
not
give
way
to
my
ruling
passion
i
give
these
poor
refugees
some
of
my
choicest
dishes
i
ruin
myself
folly
you
will
say
i
know
it
but
how
can
i
help
it
genius
carries
me
away
and
i
can
not
resist
concocting
a
dish
which
smiles
on
my
fancy
and
they
always
know
it
the
rascals
they
know
i
can
promise
you
whether
i
or
my
wife
has
stood
over
the
fire
and
what
is
the
consequence
of
customers
whom
i
used
to
see
at
my
table
every
day
when
i
first
started
in
this
wretched
place
i
now
see
twenty
on
an
average
and
give
them
credit
for
the
most
part
the
piedmontese
the
savoyards
have
deserted
but
the
connoisseurs
the
true
italians
remain
and
there
is
no
sacrifice
that
i
would
not
make
for
them
i
often
give
them
a
dinner
for
five
and
twenty
sous
which
has
cost
me
signore
giardini
s
speech
had
such
a
full
flavor
of
neapolitan
cunning
that
the
count
was
delighted
and
could
have
fancied
himself
at
gerolamo
s
since
that
is
the
case
my
good
friend
said
he
familiarly
to
the
cook
and
since
chance
and
your
confidence
have
let
me
into
the
secret
of
your
daily
sacrifices
allow
me
to
pay
as
he
spoke
andrea
spun
a
piece
on
the
stove
out
of
which
giardini
solemnly
gave
him
two
francs
and
fifty
centimes
in
change
not
without
a
certain
ceremonious
mystery
that
amused
him
hugely
in
a
few
minutes
now
the
man
added
you
will
see
your
i
will
seat
you
next
the
husband
and
if
you
wish
to
stand
in
his
good
graces
talk
about
music
i
have
invited
every
one
for
the
evening
poor
things
being
new
year
s
day
i
am
treating
the
company
to
a
dish
in
which
i
believe
i
have
surpassed
signor
giardini
s
voice
was
drowned
by
the
noisy
greetings
of
the
guests
who
streamed
in
two
and
two
or
one
at
a
time
after
the
manner
of
hote
giardini
stayed
by
the
count
playing
the
showman
by
telling
him
who
the
company
were
he
tried
by
his
witticisms
to
bring
a
smile
to
the
lips
of
a
man
who
as
his
neapolitan
instinct
told
him
might
be
a
wealthy
patron
to
turn
to
good
account
this
one
said
he
is
a
poor
composer
who
would
like
to
rise
from
to
opera
and
can
not
he
blames
the
managers
everybody
in
fact
but
himself
and
he
has
no
worse
enemy
you
can
see
what
a
florid
complexion
what
how
little
firmness
in
his
features
he
is
made
to
write
ballads
the
man
who
is
with
him
and
looks
like
a
is
a
great
music
celebrity
gigelmi
the
greatest
italian
conductor
known
but
he
has
gone
deaf
and
is
ending
his
days
in
penury
deprived
of
all
that
made
it
tolerable
ah
here
comes
our
great
ottoboni
the
most
guileless
old
fellow
on
earth
but
he
is
suspected
of
being
the
most
vindictive
of
all
who
are
plotting
for
the
regeneration
of
italy
i
can
not
think
how
they
can
bear
to
banish
such
a
good
and
here
giardini
looked
narrowly
at
the
count
who
feeling
himself
under
inquisition
as
to
his
politics
entrenched
himself
in
italian
impassibility
a
man
whose
business
it
is
to
cook
for
all
comers
can
have
no
political
opinions
excellenza
giardini
went
on
but
to
see
that
worthy
man
who
looks
more
like
a
lamb
than
a
lion
everybody
would
say
what
i
say
were
it
before
the
austrian
ambassador
himself
besides
in
these
times
liberty
is
no
longer
proscribed
it
is
going
its
rounds
again
at
least
so
these
good
people
think
said
he
leaning
over
to
speak
in
the
count
s
ear
and
why
should
i
thwart
their
hopes
i
for
my
part
do
not
hate
an
absolute
government
excellenza
every
man
of
talent
is
for
depotism
well
though
full
of
genius
ottoboni
takes
no
end
of
pains
to
educate
italy
he
writes
little
books
to
enlighten
the
intelligence
of
the
children
and
the
common
people
and
he
smuggles
them
very
cleverly
into
italy
he
takes
immense
trouble
to
reform
the
moral
sense
of
our
luckless
country
which
after
all
prefers
pleasure
to
freedom
and
perhaps
it
is
the
count
preserved
such
an
impenetrable
attitude
that
the
cook
could
discover
nothing
of
his
political
views
ottoboni
he
ran
on
is
a
saint
very
all
the
refugees
are
fond
of
him
for
excellenza
a
liberal
may
have
his
virtues
oho
here
comes
a
journalist
said
giardini
as
a
man
came
in
dressed
in
the
absurd
way
which
used
to
be
attributed
to
a
poet
in
a
garret
his
coat
was
threadbare
his
boots
split
his
hat
shiny
and
his
overcoat
deplorably
ancient
excellenza
that
poor
man
is
full
of
talent
and
incorruptibly
honest
he
was
born
into
the
wrong
times
for
he
tells
the
truth
to
everybody
no
one
can
endure
him
he
writes
theatrical
articles
for
two
small
papers
though
he
is
clever
enough
to
work
for
the
great
dailies
poor
fellow
the
rest
are
not
worth
mentioning
and
your
excellency
will
find
them
out
he
concluded
seeing
that
on
the
entrance
of
the
musician
s
wife
the
count
had
ceased
to
listen
to
him
on
seeing
andrea
here
signora
marianna
started
visibly
and
a
bright
flush
tinged
her
cheeks
here
he
is
said
giardini
in
an
undertone
clutching
the
count
s
arm
and
nodding
to
a
tall
man
how
pale
and
grave
he
is
poor
man
his
hobby
has
not
trotted
to
his
mind
i
andrea
s
prepossession
for
marianna
was
crossed
by
the
captivating
charm
which
gambara
could
not
fail
to
exert
over
every
genuine
artist
the
composer
was
now
forty
but
although
his
high
brow
was
bald
and
lined
with
a
few
parallel
but
not
deep
wrinkles
in
spite
too
of
hollow
temples
where
the
blue
veins
showed
through
the
smooth
transparent
skin
and
of
the
deep
sockets
in
which
his
black
eyes
were
sunk
with
their
large
lids
and
light
lashes
the
lower
part
of
his
face
made
him
still
look
young
so
calm
was
its
outline
so
soft
the
modeling
it
could
be
seen
at
a
glance
that
in
this
man
passion
had
been
curbed
to
the
advantage
of
the
intellect
that
the
brain
alone
had
grown
old
in
some
great
struggle
andrea
shot
a
swift
look
at
marianna
who
was
watching
him
and
he
noted
the
beautiful
italian
head
the
exquisite
proportion
and
rich
coloring
that
revealed
one
of
those
organizations
in
which
every
human
power
is
harmoniously
balanced
he
sounded
the
gulf
that
divided
this
couple
brought
together
by
fate
well
content
with
the
promise
he
inferred
from
this
dissimilarity
between
the
husband
and
wife
he
made
no
attempt
to
control
a
liking
which
ought
to
have
raised
a
barrier
between
the
fair
marianna
and
himself
he
was
already
conscious
of
feeling
a
sort
of
respectful
pity
for
this
man
whose
only
joy
she
was
as
he
understood
the
dignified
and
serene
acceptance
of
ill
fortune
that
was
expressed
in
gambara
s
mild
and
melancholy
gaze
after
expecting
to
see
one
of
the
grotesque
figures
so
often
set
before
us
by
german
novelists
and
writers
of
he
beheld
a
simple
unpretentious
man
whose
manners
and
demeanor
were
in
nothing
strange
and
did
not
lack
dignity
without
the
faintest
trace
of
luxury
his
dress
was
more
decent
than
might
have
been
expected
from
his
extreme
poverty
and
his
linen
bore
witness
to
the
tender
care
which
watched
over
every
detail
of
his
existence
andrea
looked
at
marianna
with
moistened
eyes
and
she
did
not
color
but
half
smiled
in
a
way
that
betrayed
perhaps
some
pride
at
this
speechless
homage
the
count
too
thoroughly
fascinated
to
miss
the
smallest
indication
of
complaisance
fancied
that
she
must
love
him
since
she
understood
him
so
well
from
this
moment
he
set
himself
to
conquer
the
husband
rather
than
the
wife
turning
all
his
batteries
against
the
poor
gambara
who
quite
guilelessly
went
on
eating
signor
giardini
s
without
thinking
of
their
flavor
the
count
opened
the
conversation
on
some
trivial
subject
but
at
the
first
words
he
perceived
that
this
brain
supposed
to
be
infatuated
on
one
point
was
remarkably
clear
on
all
others
and
saw
that
it
would
be
far
more
important
to
enter
into
this
very
clever
man
s
ideas
than
to
flatter
his
conceits
the
rest
of
the
company
a
hungry
crew
whose
brain
only
responded
to
the
sight
of
a
more
or
less
good
meal
showed
much
animosity
to
the
luckless
gambara
and
waited
only
till
the
end
of
the
first
course
to
give
free
vent
to
their
satire
a
refugee
whose
frequent
leer
betrayed
ambitious
schemes
on
marianna
and
who
fancied
he
could
establish
himself
in
her
good
graces
by
trying
to
make
her
husband
ridiculous
opened
fire
to
show
the
newcomer
how
the
land
lay
at
the
hote
it
is
a
very
long
time
since
we
have
heard
anything
about
the
opera
on
mahomet
cried
he
with
a
smile
at
marianna
can
it
be
that
paolo
gambara
wholly
given
up
to
domestic
cares
absorbed
by
the
charms
of
the
is
neglecting
his
superhuman
genius
leaving
his
talents
to
get
cold
and
his
imagination
to
go
flat
gambara
knew
all
the
company
he
dwelt
in
a
sphere
so
far
above
them
all
that
he
no
longer
cared
to
repel
an
attack
he
made
no
reply
it
is
not
given
to
everybody
said
the
journalist
to
have
an
intellect
that
can
understand
monsieur
gambara
s
musical
efforts
and
that
no
doubt
is
why
our
divine
maestro
hesitates
to
come
before
the
worthy
parisian
and
yet
said
the
who
had
not
opened
his
mouth
but
to
swallow
everything
that
came
within
his
reach
i
know
some
men
of
talent
who
think
highly
of
the
judgments
of
parisian
critics
i
myself
have
a
pretty
reputation
as
a
musician
he
went
on
with
an
air
of
diffidence
i
owe
it
solely
to
my
little
songs
in
and
the
success
of
my
dance
music
in
but
i
propose
ere
long
to
bring
out
a
mass
composed
for
the
anniversary
of
beethoven
s
death
and
i
expect
to
be
better
appreciated
in
paris
than
anywhere
else
you
will
perhaps
do
me
the
honor
of
hearing
it
he
said
turning
to
andrea
thank
you
said
the
count
but
i
do
not
conceive
that
i
am
gifted
with
the
organs
needful
for
the
appreciation
of
french
music
if
you
were
dead
monsieur
and
beethoven
had
composed
the
mass
i
would
not
have
failed
to
attend
the
this
retort
put
an
end
to
the
tactics
of
those
who
wanted
to
set
gambara
off
on
his
high
horse
to
amuse
the
new
guest
andrea
was
already
conscious
of
an
unwillingness
to
expose
so
noble
and
pathetic
a
mania
as
a
spectacle
for
so
much
vulgar
shrewdness
it
was
with
no
base
reservation
that
he
kept
up
a
desultory
conversation
in
the
course
of
which
signor
giardini
s
nose
not
infrequently
interposed
between
two
remarks
whenever
gambara
uttered
some
elegant
repartee
or
some
paradoxical
aphorism
the
cook
put
his
head
forward
to
glance
with
pity
at
the
musician
and
with
meaning
at
the
count
muttering
in
his
ear
then
came
a
moment
when
the
interrupted
the
flow
of
his
judicial
observations
to
devote
himself
to
the
second
course
which
he
considered
highly
important
during
his
absence
which
was
brief
gambara
leaned
across
to
address
andrea
our
worthy
host
said
he
in
an
undertone
threatens
to
regale
us
with
a
dish
of
his
own
concocting
which
i
recommend
you
to
avoid
though
his
wife
has
had
an
eye
on
him
the
good
man
has
a
mania
for
innovations
he
ruined
himself
by
experiments
the
last
of
which
compelled
him
to
fly
from
rome
without
a
passport
a
circumstance
he
does
not
talk
about
after
purchasing
the
of
a
popular
restaurant
he
was
trusted
to
prepare
a
banquet
given
by
a
lately
made
cardinal
whose
household
was
not
yet
complete
giardini
fancied
he
had
an
opportunity
for
distinguishing
himself
and
he
succeeded
for
that
same
evening
he
was
accused
of
trying
to
poison
the
whole
conclave
and
was
obliged
to
leave
rome
and
italy
without
waiting
to
pack
up
this
disaster
was
the
last
straw
now
and
gambara
put
his
finger
to
his
forehead
and
shook
his
head
he
is
a
good
fellow
all
the
same
he
added
my
wife
will
tell
you
that
we
owe
him
many
a
good
giardini
now
came
in
carefully
bearing
a
dish
which
he
set
in
the
middle
of
the
table
and
he
then
modestly
resumed
his
seat
next
to
andrea
whom
he
served
first
as
soon
as
he
had
tasted
the
mess
the
count
felt
that
an
impassable
gulf
divided
the
second
mouthful
from
the
first
he
was
much
embarrassed
and
very
anxious
not
to
annoy
the
cook
who
was
watching
him
narrowly
though
a
french
may
care
little
about
seeing
a
dish
scorned
if
he
is
sure
of
being
paid
for
it
it
is
not
so
with
an
italian
who
is
not
often
satiated
with
praises
to
gain
time
andrea
complimented
giardini
enthusiastically
but
he
leaned
over
to
whisper
in
his
ear
and
slipping
a
gold
piece
into
his
hand
under
the
table
begged
him
to
go
out
and
buy
a
few
bottles
of
champagne
leaving
him
free
to
take
all
the
credit
of
the
treat
when
the
italian
returned
every
plate
was
cleared
and
the
room
rang
with
praises
of
the
the
champagne
soon
mounted
these
southern
brains
and
the
conversation
till
now
subdued
in
the
stranger
s
presence
overleaped
the
limits
of
suspicious
reserve
to
wander
far
over
the
wide
fields
of
political
and
artistic
opinions
andrea
to
whom
no
form
of
intoxication
was
known
but
those
of
love
and
poetry
had
soon
gained
the
attention
of
the
company
and
skilfully
led
it
to
a
discussion
of
matters
musical
will
you
tell
me
monsieur
said
he
to
the
composer
of
how
it
is
that
the
napoleon
of
these
tunes
can
condescend
to
usurp
the
place
of
palestrina
pergolesi
and
mozart
poor
creatures
who
must
pack
and
vanish
at
the
advent
of
that
tremendous
mass
for
the
dead
well
monsieur
replied
the
composer
a
musician
always
finds
it
difficult
to
reply
when
the
answer
needs
the
cooperation
of
a
hundred
skilled
executants
mozart
haydn
and
beethoven
without
an
orchestra
would
be
of
no
great
of
no
great
account
said
marcosini
why
all
the
world
knows
that
the
immortal
author
of
and
the
was
named
mozart
and
i
am
so
unhappy
as
not
to
know
the
name
of
the
inexhaustible
writer
of
quadrilles
which
are
so
popular
in
our
music
exists
independently
of
execution
said
the
retired
conductor
who
in
spite
of
his
deafness
had
caught
a
few
words
of
the
conversation
as
he
looks
through
the
symphony
by
beethoven
a
musician
is
transported
to
the
world
of
fancy
on
the
golden
wings
of
the
subject
in
repeated
by
the
horns
in
he
sees
a
whole
realm
by
turns
glorious
in
dazzling
shafts
of
light
gloomy
under
clouds
of
melancholy
and
cheered
by
heavenly
the
new
school
has
left
beethoven
far
behind
said
the
scornfully
beethoven
is
not
yet
understood
said
the
count
how
can
he
be
excelled
gambara
drank
a
large
glass
of
champagne
accompanying
the
draught
by
a
covert
smile
of
approval
beethoven
the
count
went
on
extended
the
limits
of
instrumental
music
and
no
one
followed
in
his
gambara
assented
with
a
nod
his
work
is
especially
noteworthy
for
simplicity
of
construction
and
for
the
way
the
scheme
is
worked
out
the
count
went
on
most
composers
make
use
of
the
orchestral
parts
in
a
vague
incoherent
way
combining
them
for
a
merely
temporary
effect
they
do
not
persistently
contribute
to
the
whole
mass
of
the
movement
by
their
steady
and
regular
progress
beethoven
assigns
its
part
to
each
from
the
first
like
the
various
companies
which
by
their
disciplined
movements
contribute
to
winning
a
battle
the
orchestral
parts
of
a
symphony
by
beethoven
obey
the
plan
ordered
for
the
interest
of
all
and
are
subordinate
to
an
admirably
conceived
scheme
in
this
he
may
be
compared
to
a
genius
of
a
different
type
in
walter
scott
s
splendid
historical
novels
some
personage
who
seems
to
have
least
to
do
with
the
action
of
the
story
intervenes
at
a
given
moment
and
leads
up
to
the
climax
by
some
thread
woven
into
the
remarked
gambara
to
whom
common
sense
seemed
to
return
in
inverse
proportion
to
sobriety
andrea
eager
to
carry
the
test
further
for
a
moment
forgot
all
his
predilections
he
proceeded
to
attack
the
european
fame
of
rossini
disputing
the
position
which
the
italian
school
has
taken
by
storm
night
after
night
for
more
than
thirty
years
on
a
hundred
stages
in
europe
he
had
undertaken
a
hard
task
the
first
words
he
spoke
raised
a
strong
murmur
of
disapproval
but
neither
the
repeated
interruptions
nor
exclamations
nor
frowns
nor
contemptuous
looks
could
check
this
determined
advocate
of
beethoven
compare
said
he
that
sublime
composer
s
works
with
what
by
common
consent
is
called
italian
music
what
feebleness
of
ideas
what
limpness
of
style
that
monotony
of
form
those
commonplace
cadenzas
those
endless
bravura
passages
introduced
at
haphazard
irrespective
of
the
dramatic
situation
that
recurrent
that
rossini
brought
into
vogue
are
now
an
integral
part
of
every
composition
those
vocal
fireworks
result
in
a
sort
of
babbling
chattering
vaporous
mucic
of
which
the
sole
merit
depends
on
the
greater
or
less
fluency
of
the
singer
and
his
rapidity
of
vocalization
the
italian
school
has
lost
sight
of
the
high
mission
of
art
instead
of
elevating
the
crowd
it
has
condescended
to
the
crowd
it
has
won
its
success
only
by
accepting
the
suffrages
of
all
comers
and
appealing
to
the
vulgar
minds
which
constitute
the
majority
such
a
success
is
mere
street
juggling
in
short
the
compositions
of
rossini
in
whom
this
music
is
personified
with
those
of
the
writers
who
are
more
or
less
of
his
school
to
me
seem
worthy
at
best
to
collect
a
crowd
in
the
street
round
a
grinding
organ
as
an
accompaniment
to
the
capers
of
a
puppet
show
i
even
prefer
french
music
and
i
can
say
no
more
long
live
german
music
cried
he
when
it
is
tuneful
he
added
to
a
low
voice
this
sally
was
the
upshot
of
a
long
preliminary
discussion
in
which
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
andrea
had
divagated
in
the
upper
sphere
of
metaphysics
with
the
ease
of
a
somnambulist
walking
over
the
roofs
gambara
keenly
interested
in
all
this
transcendentalism
had
not
lost
a
word
he
took
up
his
parable
as
soon
as
andrea
seemed
to
have
ended
and
a
little
stir
of
revived
attention
was
evident
among
the
guests
of
whom
several
had
been
about
to
leave
you
attack
the
italian
school
with
much
vigor
said
gambara
somewhat
warmed
to
his
work
by
the
champagne
and
for
my
part
you
are
very
welcome
i
thank
god
stand
outside
this
more
or
less
melodic
frippery
still
as
a
man
of
the
world
you
are
too
ungrateful
to
the
classic
land
whence
germany
and
france
derived
their
first
teaching
while
the
compositions
of
carissimi
cavalli
scarlatti
and
rossi
were
being
played
throughout
italy
the
violin
players
of
the
paris
opera
house
enjoyed
the
singular
privilege
of
being
allowed
to
play
in
gloves
lulli
who
extended
the
realm
of
harmony
and
was
the
first
to
classify
discords
on
arriving
in
france
found
but
two
men
a
cook
and
a
mason
whose
voice
and
intelligence
were
equal
to
performing
his
music
he
made
a
tenor
of
the
former
and
transformed
the
latter
into
a
bass
at
that
time
germany
had
no
musician
excepting
sebastian
but
you
monsieur
though
you
are
so
young
gambara
added
in
the
humble
tone
of
a
man
who
expects
to
find
his
remarks
received
with
scorn
or
must
have
given
much
time
to
the
study
of
these
high
matters
of
art
you
could
not
otherwise
explain
them
so
this
word
made
many
of
the
hearers
smile
for
they
had
understood
nothing
of
the
fine
distinctions
drawn
by
andrea
giardini
indeed
convinced
that
the
count
had
been
talking
mere
rhodomontade
nudged
him
with
a
laugh
in
his
sleeve
as
at
a
good
joke
in
which
he
flattered
himself
that
he
was
a
partner
there
is
a
great
deal
that
strikes
me
as
very
true
in
all
you
have
said
gambara
went
on
but
be
careful
your
argument
while
reflecting
on
italian
sensuality
seems
to
me
to
lean
towards
german
idealism
which
is
no
less
fatal
heresy
if
men
of
imagination
and
good
sense
like
you
desert
one
camp
only
to
join
the
other
if
they
can
not
keep
to
the
happy
medium
between
two
forms
of
extravagance
we
shall
always
be
exposed
to
the
satire
of
the
sophists
who
deny
all
progress
who
compare
the
genius
of
man
to
this
tablecloth
which
being
too
short
to
cover
the
whole
of
signor
giardini
s
table
decks
one
end
at
the
expense
of
the
giardini
bounded
in
his
seat
as
if
he
had
been
stung
by
a
but
swift
reflections
restored
him
to
his
dignity
as
a
host
he
looked
up
to
heaven
and
again
nudged
the
count
who
was
beginning
to
think
the
cook
more
crazy
than
gambara
this
serious
and
pious
way
of
speaking
of
art
interested
the
milanese
extremely
seated
between
these
two
distracted
brains
one
so
noble
and
the
other
so
common
and
making
game
of
each
other
to
the
great
entertainment
of
the
crowd
there
was
a
moment
when
the
count
found
himself
wavering
between
the
sublime
and
its
parody
the
farcical
extremes
of
human
life
ignoring
the
chain
of
incredible
events
which
had
brought
them
to
this
smoky
den
he
believed
himself
to
be
the
plaything
of
some
strange
hallucination
and
thought
of
gambara
and
giardini
as
two
abstractions
meanwhile
after
a
last
piece
of
buffoonery
from
the
deaf
conductor
in
reply
to
gambara
the
company
had
broken
up
laughing
loudly
giardini
went
off
to
make
coffee
which
he
begged
the
select
few
to
accept
and
his
wife
cleared
the
table
the
count
sitting
near
the
stove
between
marianna
and
gambara
was
in
the
very
position
which
the
mad
musician
thought
most
desirable
with
sensuousness
on
one
side
and
idealism
on
the
other
gambara
finding
himself
for
the
first
time
in
the
society
of
a
man
who
did
not
laugh
at
him
to
his
face
soon
diverged
from
generalities
to
talk
of
himself
of
his
life
his
work
and
the
musical
regeneration
of
which
he
believed
himself
to
be
the
messiah
listen
said
he
you
who
so
far
have
not
insulted
me
i
will
tell
you
the
story
of
my
life
not
to
make
a
boast
of
my
perseverance
which
is
no
virtue
of
mine
but
to
the
greater
glory
of
him
who
has
given
me
strength
you
seem
kind
and
pious
if
you
do
not
believe
in
me
at
least
you
will
pity
me
pity
is
human
faith
comes
from
andrea
turned
and
drew
back
under
his
chair
the
foot
that
had
been
seeking
that
of
the
fair
marianna
fixing
his
eyes
on
her
while
listening
to
gambara
i
was
born
at
cremona
the
son
of
an
instrument
maker
a
fairly
good
performer
and
an
even
better
composer
the
musician
began
thus
at
an
early
age
i
had
mastered
the
laws
of
musical
construction
in
its
twofold
aspects
the
material
and
the
spiritual
and
as
an
inquisitive
child
i
observed
many
things
which
subsequently
recurred
to
the
mind
of
the
man
the
french
turned
us
out
of
our
own
home
my
father
and
me
we
were
ruined
by
the
war
thus
at
the
age
of
ten
i
entered
on
the
wandering
life
to
which
most
men
have
been
condemned
whose
brains
were
busy
with
innovations
whether
in
art
science
or
politics
fate
or
the
instincts
of
their
mind
which
can
not
fit
into
the
compartments
where
the
trading
class
sit
providentially
guides
them
to
the
spots
where
they
may
find
teaching
led
by
my
passion
for
music
i
wandered
throughout
italy
from
theatre
to
theatre
living
on
very
little
as
men
can
live
there
sometimes
i
played
the
bass
in
an
orchestra
sometimes
i
was
on
the
boards
in
the
chorus
sometimes
under
them
with
the
carpenters
thus
i
learned
every
kind
of
musical
effect
studying
the
tones
of
instruments
and
of
the
human
voice
wherein
they
differed
and
how
they
harmonized
listening
to
the
score
and
applying
the
rules
taught
me
by
my
father
it
was
hungry
work
in
a
land
where
the
sun
always
shines
where
art
is
all
pervading
but
where
there
is
no
pay
for
the
artist
since
rome
is
but
nominally
the
sovereign
of
the
christian
world
sometimes
made
welcome
sometimes
scouted
for
my
poverty
i
never
lost
courage
i
heard
a
voice
within
me
promising
me
fame
music
seemed
to
me
in
its
infancy
and
i
think
so
still
all
that
is
left
to
us
of
musical
effort
before
the
seventeenth
century
proves
to
me
that
early
musicians
knew
melody
only
they
were
ignorant
of
harmony
and
its
immense
resources
music
is
at
once
a
science
and
an
art
it
is
rooted
in
physics
and
mathematics
hence
it
is
a
science
inspiration
makes
it
an
art
unconsciously
utilizing
the
theorems
of
science
it
is
founded
in
physics
by
the
very
nature
of
the
matter
it
works
on
sound
is
air
in
motion
the
air
is
formed
of
constituents
which
in
us
no
doubt
meet
with
analogous
elements
that
respond
to
them
sympathize
and
magnify
them
by
the
power
of
the
mind
thus
the
air
must
include
a
vast
variety
of
molecules
of
various
degrees
of
elasticity
and
capable
of
vibrating
in
as
many
different
periods
as
there
are
tones
from
all
kinds
of
sonorous
bodies
and
these
molecules
set
in
motion
by
the
musician
and
falling
on
our
ear
answer
to
our
ideas
according
to
each
man
s
temperament
i
myself
believe
that
sound
is
identical
in
its
nature
with
light
sound
is
light
perceived
under
another
form
each
acts
through
vibrations
to
which
man
is
sensitive
and
which
he
transforms
in
the
nervous
centres
into
ideas
music
like
painting
makes
use
of
materials
which
have
the
property
of
liberating
this
or
that
property
from
the
surrounding
medium
and
so
suggesting
an
image
the
instruments
in
music
perform
this
part
as
color
does
in
painting
and
whereas
each
sound
produced
by
a
sonorous
body
is
invariably
allied
with
its
major
third
and
fifth
whereas
it
acts
on
grains
of
fine
sand
lying
on
stretched
parchment
so
as
to
distribute
them
in
geometrical
figures
that
are
always
the
same
according
to
the
pitch
quite
regular
when
the
combination
is
a
true
chord
and
indefinite
when
the
sounds
are
dissonant
i
say
that
music
is
an
art
conceived
in
the
very
bowels
of
nature
music
is
subject
to
physical
and
mathematical
laws
physical
laws
are
but
little
known
mathematics
are
well
understood
and
it
is
since
their
relations
have
been
studied
that
the
harmony
has
been
created
to
which
we
owe
the
works
of
haydn
mozart
beethoven
and
rossini
grand
geniuses
whose
music
is
undoubtedly
nearer
to
perfection
than
that
of
their
precursors
though
their
genius
too
is
unquestionable
the
old
masters
could
sing
but
they
had
not
art
and
science
at
their
command
a
noble
alliance
which
enables
us
to
merge
into
one
the
finest
melody
and
the
power
of
harmony
now
if
a
knowledge
of
mathematical
laws
gave
us
these
four
great
musicians
what
may
we
not
attain
to
if
we
can
discover
the
physical
laws
in
virtue
of
which
grasp
this
clearly
we
may
collect
in
larger
or
smaller
quantities
according
to
the
proportions
we
may
require
an
ethereal
substance
diffused
in
the
atmosphere
which
is
the
medium
alike
of
music
and
of
light
of
the
phenomena
of
vegetation
and
of
animal
life
do
you
follow
me
those
new
laws
would
arm
the
composer
with
new
powers
by
supplying
him
with
instruments
superior
of
those
now
in
use
and
perhaps
with
a
potency
of
harmony
immense
as
compared
with
that
now
at
his
command
if
every
modified
shade
of
sound
answers
to
a
force
that
must
be
known
to
enable
us
to
combine
all
these
forces
in
accordance
with
their
true
laws
composers
work
with
substances
of
which
they
know
nothing
why
should
a
brass
and
a
wooden
instrument
a
bassoon
and
horn
have
so
little
identity
of
tone
when
they
act
on
the
same
matter
the
constituent
gases
of
the
air
their
differences
proceed
from
some
displacement
of
those
constituents
from
the
way
they
act
on
the
elements
which
are
their
affinity
and
which
they
return
modified
by
some
occult
and
unknown
process
if
we
knew
what
the
process
was
science
and
art
would
both
be
gainers
whatever
extends
science
enhances
art
well
these
are
the
discoveries
i
have
guessed
and
made
yes
said
gambara
with
increasing
vehemence
hitherto
men
have
noted
effects
rather
than
causes
if
they
could
but
master
the
causes
music
would
be
the
greatest
of
the
arts
is
it
not
the
one
which
strikes
deepest
to
the
soul
you
see
in
painting
no
more
than
it
shows
you
in
poetry
you
have
only
what
the
poet
says
music
goes
far
beyond
this
does
it
not
form
your
taste
and
rouse
dormant
memories
in
a
there
may
be
a
thousand
souls
a
strain
is
flung
out
from
pasta
s
throat
the
execution
worthily
answering
to
the
ideas
that
flashed
through
rossini
s
mind
as
he
wrote
the
air
that
phrase
of
rossini
s
transmitted
to
those
attentive
souls
is
worked
out
in
so
many
different
poems
to
one
it
presents
a
woman
long
dreamed
of
to
another
some
distant
shore
where
he
wandered
long
ago
it
rises
up
before
him
with
its
drooping
willows
its
clear
waters
and
the
hopes
that
then
played
under
its
leafy
arbors
one
woman
is
reminded
of
the
myriad
feelings
that
tortured
her
during
an
hour
of
jealousy
while
another
thinks
of
the
unsatisfied
cravings
of
her
heart
and
paints
in
the
glowing
hues
of
a
dream
an
ideal
lover
to
whom
she
abandons
herself
with
the
rapture
of
the
woman
in
the
roman
mosaic
who
embraces
a
chimera
yet
a
third
is
thinking
that
this
very
evening
some
joy
is
to
be
hers
and
rushes
by
anticipation
into
the
tide
of
happiness
its
dashing
waves
breaking
against
her
burning
bosom
music
alone
has
this
power
of
throwing
us
back
on
ourselves
the
other
arts
give
us
infinite
pleasure
but
i
am
digressing
these
were
my
first
ideas
vague
indeed
for
an
inventor
at
the
beginning
only
catches
glimpses
of
the
dawn
as
it
were
so
i
kept
these
glorious
ideas
at
the
bottom
of
my
knapsack
and
they
gave
me
spirit
to
eat
the
dry
crust
i
often
dipped
in
the
water
of
a
spring
i
worked
i
composed
airs
and
after
playing
them
on
any
instrument
that
came
to
hand
i
went
off
again
on
foot
across
italy
finally
at
the
age
of
i
settled
in
venice
where
for
the
first
time
i
enjoyed
rest
and
found
myself
in
a
decent
position
i
there
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
venetian
nobleman
who
liked
my
ideas
who
encouraged
me
in
my
investigations
and
who
got
me
employment
at
the
venice
theatre
living
was
cheap
lodging
inexpensive
i
had
a
room
in
that
capello
palace
from
which
the
famous
bianca
came
forth
one
evening
to
become
a
grand
duchess
of
tuscany
and
i
would
dream
that
my
unrecognized
fame
would
also
emerge
from
thence
one
day
to
be
crowned
i
spent
my
evenings
at
the
theatre
and
my
days
in
work
then
came
disaster
the
performance
of
an
opera
in
which
i
had
experimented
trying
my
music
was
a
failure
no
one
understood
my
score
for
the
set
beethoven
before
the
italians
and
they
are
out
of
their
depth
no
one
had
patience
enough
to
wait
for
the
effect
to
be
produced
by
the
different
motives
given
out
by
each
instrument
which
were
all
at
last
to
combine
in
a
grand
i
had
built
some
hopes
on
the
success
of
the
for
we
votaries
of
the
blue
divinity
hope
always
discount
results
when
a
man
believes
himself
destined
to
do
great
things
it
is
hard
not
to
fancy
them
achieved
the
bushel
always
has
some
cracks
through
which
the
light
shines
my
wife
s
family
lodged
in
the
same
house
and
the
hope
of
winning
marianna
who
often
smiled
at
me
from
her
window
had
done
much
to
encourage
my
efforts
i
now
fell
into
the
deepest
melancholy
as
i
sounded
the
depths
of
a
life
of
poverty
a
perpetual
struggle
in
which
love
must
die
marianna
acted
as
genius
does
she
jumped
across
every
obstacle
both
feet
at
once
i
will
not
speak
of
the
little
happiness
which
shed
its
gilding
on
the
beginning
of
my
misfortunes
dismayed
at
my
failure
i
decided
that
italy
was
not
intelligent
enough
and
too
much
sunk
in
the
dull
round
of
routine
to
accept
the
innovations
i
conceived
of
so
i
thought
of
going
to
germany
i
traveled
thither
by
way
of
hungary
listening
to
the
myriad
voices
of
nature
and
trying
to
reproduce
that
sublime
harmony
by
the
help
of
instruments
which
i
constructed
or
altered
for
the
purpose
these
experiments
involved
me
in
vast
expenses
which
had
soon
exhausted
my
savings
and
yet
those
were
our
golden
days
in
germany
i
was
appreciated
there
has
been
nothing
in
my
life
more
glorious
than
that
time
i
can
think
of
nothing
to
compare
with
the
vehement
joys
i
found
by
the
side
of
marianna
whose
beauty
was
then
of
really
heavenly
radiance
and
splendor
in
short
i
was
happy
during
that
period
of
weakness
i
more
than
once
expressed
my
passion
in
the
language
of
earthly
harmony
i
even
wrote
some
of
those
airs
just
like
geometrical
patterns
which
are
so
much
admired
in
the
world
of
fashion
that
you
move
in
but
as
soon
as
i
made
a
little
way
i
met
with
insuperable
obstacles
raised
by
my
rivals
all
hypercritical
or
unappreciative
i
had
heard
of
france
as
being
a
country
where
novelties
were
favorably
received
and
i
wanted
to
get
there
my
wife
had
a
little
money
and
we
came
to
paris
till
then
no
one
had
actually
laughed
in
my
face
but
in
this
dreadful
city
i
had
to
endure
that
new
form
of
torture
to
which
abject
poverty
ere
long
added
its
bitter
sufferings
reduced
to
lodging
in
this
mephitic
quarter
for
many
months
we
have
lived
exclusively
on
marianna
s
sewing
she
having
found
employment
for
her
needle
in
working
for
the
unhappy
prostitutes
who
make
this
street
their
hunting
ground
marianna
assures
me
that
among
those
poor
creatures
she
has
met
with
such
consideration
and
generosity
as
i
for
my
part
ascribe
to
the
ascendency
of
virtue
so
pure
that
even
vice
is
compelled
to
respect
hope
on
said
andrea
perhaps
you
have
reached
the
end
of
your
trials
and
while
waiting
for
the
time
when
my
endeavor
seconding
yours
shall
set
your
labors
in
a
true
light
allow
me
as
a
and
an
artist
like
yourself
to
offer
you
some
little
advances
on
the
undoubted
success
of
your
all
that
has
to
do
with
matters
of
material
existence
i
leave
to
my
wife
replied
gambara
she
will
decide
as
to
what
we
may
accept
without
a
blush
from
so
thorough
a
gentleman
as
you
seem
to
be
for
my
part
and
it
is
long
since
i
have
allowed
myself
to
indulge
such
full
confidences
i
must
now
ask
you
to
allow
me
to
leave
you
i
see
a
melody
beckoning
to
me
dancing
and
floating
before
me
bare
and
quivering
like
a
girl
entreating
her
lover
for
her
clothes
which
he
has
hidden
i
must
go
and
dress
my
mistress
my
wife
i
leave
with
he
hurried
away
as
a
man
who
blames
himself
for
the
loss
of
valuable
time
and
marianna
somewhat
embarrassed
prepared
to
follow
him
andrea
dared
not
detain
her
giardini
came
to
the
rescue
but
you
heard
signora
said
he
your
husband
has
left
you
to
settle
some
little
matters
with
the
signor
marianna
sat
down
again
but
without
raising
her
eyes
to
andrea
who
hesitated
before
speaking
and
will
not
signor
gambara
s
confidence
entitle
me
to
his
wife
s
he
said
in
agitated
tones
can
the
fair
marianna
refuse
to
tell
me
the
story
of
her
life
my
life
said
marianna
it
is
the
life
of
the
ivy
if
you
wish
to
know
the
story
of
my
heart
you
must
suppose
me
equally
destitute
of
pride
and
of
modesty
if
you
can
ask
me
to
tell
it
after
what
you
have
just
of
whom
then
can
i
ask
it
cried
the
count
in
whom
passion
was
blinding
his
wits
of
yourself
replied
marianna
either
you
understand
me
by
this
time
or
you
never
will
try
to
ask
i
will
but
you
must
listen
and
this
hand
which
i
am
holding
is
to
lie
in
mine
as
long
as
my
narrative
is
i
am
listening
said
marianna
a
woman
s
life
begins
with
her
first
passion
said
andrea
and
my
dear
marianna
began
to
live
only
on
the
day
when
she
first
saw
paolo
gambara
she
needed
some
deep
passion
to
feed
upon
and
above
all
some
interesting
weakness
to
shelter
and
uphold
the
beautiful
woman
s
nature
with
which
she
is
endowed
is
perhaps
not
so
truly
passion
as
maternal
love
you
sigh
marianna
i
have
touched
one
of
the
aching
wounds
in
your
heart
it
was
a
noble
part
for
you
to
play
so
young
as
you
were
that
of
protectress
to
a
noble
but
wandering
intellect
you
said
to
yourself
paolo
will
be
my
genius
i
shall
be
his
common
sense
between
us
we
shall
be
that
almost
divine
being
called
an
angel
the
sublime
creature
that
enjoys
and
understands
reason
never
stifling
and
then
in
the
first
impetus
of
youth
you
heard
the
thousand
voices
of
nature
which
the
poet
longed
to
reproduce
enthusiasm
clutched
you
when
paolo
spread
before
you
the
treasures
of
poetry
while
seeking
to
embody
them
in
the
sublime
but
restricted
language
of
music
you
admired
him
when
delirious
rapture
carried
him
up
and
away
from
you
for
you
liked
to
believe
that
all
this
devious
energy
would
at
last
come
down
and
alight
as
love
but
you
knew
not
the
tyrannous
and
jealous
despotism
of
the
ideal
over
the
minds
that
fall
in
love
with
it
gambara
before
meeting
you
had
given
himself
over
to
the
haughty
and
overbearing
mistress
with
whom
you
have
struggled
for
him
to
this
day
once
for
an
instant
you
had
a
vision
of
happiness
paolo
tumbling
from
the
lofty
sphere
where
his
spirit
was
constantly
soaring
was
amazed
to
find
reality
so
sweet
you
fancied
that
his
madness
would
be
lulled
in
the
arms
of
love
but
before
long
music
again
clutched
her
prey
the
dazzling
mirage
which
had
cheated
you
into
the
joys
of
reciprocal
love
made
the
lonely
path
on
which
you
had
started
look
more
desolate
and
barren
in
the
tale
your
husband
has
just
told
me
i
could
read
as
plainly
as
in
the
contrast
between
your
looks
and
his
all
the
painful
secrets
of
that
union
in
which
you
have
accepted
the
sufferer
s
part
though
your
conduct
has
been
unfailingly
heroical
though
your
firmness
has
never
once
given
way
in
the
exercise
of
your
painful
duties
perhaps
in
the
silence
of
lonely
nights
the
heart
that
at
this
moment
is
beating
so
wildly
in
your
breast
may
from
time
to
time
have
rebelled
your
husband
s
superiority
was
in
itself
your
worst
torment
if
he
had
been
less
noble
less
you
might
have
deserted
him
but
his
virtues
upheld
yours
you
wondered
perhaps
whether
his
heroism
or
your
own
would
be
the
first
to
give
way
you
clung
to
your
really
magnanimous
task
as
paolo
clung
to
his
chimera
if
you
had
had
nothing
but
a
devotion
to
duty
to
guide
and
sustain
you
triumph
might
have
seemed
easier
you
would
only
have
had
to
crush
your
heart
and
transfer
your
life
into
the
world
of
abstractions
religion
would
have
absorbed
all
else
and
you
would
have
lived
for
an
idea
like
those
saintly
women
who
kill
all
the
instincts
of
nature
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
but
the
charm
of
paolo
the
loftiness
of
his
mind
his
rare
and
touching
proofs
of
tenderness
constantly
drag
you
down
from
that
ideal
realm
where
virtue
would
fain
maintain
you
they
perennially
revive
in
you
the
energies
you
have
exhausted
in
contending
with
the
phantom
of
love
you
never
suspected
this
the
faintest
glimmer
of
hope
led
you
on
in
pursuit
of
the
sweet
vision
at
last
the
disappointments
of
many
years
have
undermined
your
patience
an
angel
would
have
lost
it
long
since
and
now
the
apparition
so
long
pursued
is
no
more
than
a
shade
without
substance
madness
that
is
so
nearly
allied
to
genius
can
know
no
cure
in
this
world
when
this
thought
first
struck
you
you
looked
back
on
your
past
youth
sacrificed
if
not
wasted
you
then
bitterly
discerned
the
blunder
of
nature
that
had
given
you
a
father
when
you
looked
for
a
husband
you
asked
yourself
whether
you
had
not
gone
beyond
the
duty
of
a
wife
in
keeping
yourself
wholly
for
a
man
who
was
bound
up
in
his
science
marianna
leave
your
hand
in
mine
all
i
have
said
is
true
and
you
looked
about
you
but
now
you
were
in
paris
not
in
italy
where
men
know
how
to
love
oh
let
me
finish
the
tale
cried
marianna
i
would
rather
say
things
myself
i
will
be
honest
i
feel
that
i
am
speaking
to
my
truest
friend
yes
i
was
in
paris
when
all
you
have
expressed
so
clearly
took
place
in
my
mind
but
when
i
saw
you
i
was
saved
for
i
had
never
met
with
the
love
i
had
dreamed
of
from
my
childhood
my
poor
dress
and
my
had
hidden
me
from
the
eyes
of
men
of
your
class
a
few
young
men
whose
position
did
not
allow
of
their
insulting
me
were
all
the
more
intolerable
for
the
levity
with
which
they
treated
me
some
made
game
of
my
husband
as
if
he
were
merely
a
ridiculous
old
man
others
basely
tried
to
win
his
good
graces
to
betray
me
one
and
all
talked
of
getting
me
away
from
him
and
none
understood
the
devotion
i
feel
for
a
soul
that
is
so
far
away
from
us
only
because
it
is
so
near
heaven
for
that
friend
that
brother
whose
handmaid
i
will
always
be
you
alone
understood
did
you
not
the
tie
that
binds
me
to
him
tell
me
that
you
feel
a
sincere
and
disinterested
regard
for
my
paolo
i
gladly
accept
your
praises
andrea
interrupted
but
go
no
further
do
not
compel
me
to
contradict
you
i
love
you
marianna
as
we
love
in
the
beautiful
country
where
we
both
were
born
i
love
you
with
all
my
soul
and
with
all
my
strength
but
before
offering
you
that
love
i
will
be
worthy
of
yours
i
will
make
a
last
attempt
to
give
back
to
you
the
man
you
have
loved
so
long
and
will
love
forever
till
success
or
defeat
is
certain
accept
without
any
shame
the
modest
ease
i
can
give
you
both
we
will
go
and
choose
a
place
where
he
may
live
have
you
such
regard
for
me
as
will
allow
you
to
make
me
the
partner
in
your
guardianship
marianna
surprised
at
such
magnanimity
held
out
her
hand
to
the
count
who
went
away
trying
to
evade
the
civilities
of
giardini
and
his
wife
on
the
following
day
giardini
took
the
count
up
to
the
room
where
the
gambaras
lodged
though
marianna
fully
knew
her
lover
s
noble
soul
for
there
are
natures
which
quickly
enter
into
each
other
s
spirit
marianna
was
too
good
a
housewife
not
to
betray
her
annoyance
at
receiving
such
a
fine
gentleman
in
so
humble
a
room
everything
was
exquisitely
clean
she
had
spent
the
morning
in
dusting
her
motley
furniture
the
handiwork
of
signor
giardini
who
had
put
it
together
at
odd
moments
of
leisure
out
of
the
fragments
of
the
instruments
rejected
by
gambara
andrea
had
never
seen
anything
quite
so
crazy
to
keep
a
decent
countenance
he
turned
away
from
a
grotesque
bed
contrived
by
the
ingenious
cook
in
the
case
of
an
old
harpsichord
and
looked
at
marianna
s
narrow
couch
of
which
the
single
mattress
was
covered
with
a
white
muslin
counterpane
a
circumstance
that
gave
rise
in
his
mind
to
some
sad
but
sweet
thoughts
he
wished
to
speak
of
his
plans
and
of
his
morning
s
work
but
gambara
in
his
enthusiasm
believing
that
he
had
at
last
met
with
a
willing
listener
took
possession
of
him
and
compelled
him
to
listen
to
the
opera
he
had
written
for
paris
in
the
first
place
monsieur
said
the
composer
allow
me
to
explain
the
subject
in
a
few
words
here
the
hearers
receiving
a
musical
impression
do
not
work
it
out
in
themselves
as
religion
bids
us
work
out
the
texts
of
scripture
in
prayer
hence
it
is
very
difficult
to
make
them
understand
that
there
is
in
nature
an
eternal
melody
exquisitely
sweet
a
perfect
harmony
disturbed
only
by
revolutions
independent
of
the
divine
will
as
passions
are
uncontrolled
by
the
will
of
men
i
therefore
had
to
seek
a
vast
framework
in
which
effect
and
cause
might
both
be
included
for
the
aim
of
my
music
is
to
give
a
picture
of
the
life
of
nations
from
the
loftiest
point
of
view
my
opera
for
which
i
myself
wrote
the
for
a
poet
would
never
have
fully
developed
the
subject
is
the
life
of
mahomet
a
figure
in
whom
the
magic
of
sabaeanism
combined
with
the
oriental
poetry
of
the
hebrew
scriptures
to
result
in
one
of
the
greatest
human
epics
the
arab
dominion
mahomet
certainly
derived
from
the
hebrews
the
idea
of
a
despotic
government
and
from
the
religion
of
the
shepherd
tribes
or
sabaeans
the
spirit
of
expansion
which
created
the
splendid
empire
of
the
khalifs
his
destiny
was
stamped
on
him
in
his
birth
for
his
father
was
a
heathen
and
his
mother
a
jewess
ah
my
dear
count
to
be
a
great
musician
a
man
must
be
very
learned
without
knowledge
he
can
get
no
local
color
and
put
no
ideas
into
his
music
the
composer
who
sings
for
singing
s
sake
is
an
artisan
not
an
artist
this
magnificent
opera
is
the
continuation
of
the
great
work
i
projected
my
first
opera
was
called
and
i
intend
to
write
a
third
on
jerusalem
delivered
you
perceive
the
beauty
of
this
trilogy
and
what
a
variety
of
motives
it
offers
the
martyrs
mahomet
the
deliverance
of
jerusalem
the
god
of
the
west
the
god
of
the
east
and
the
struggle
of
their
worshipers
over
a
tomb
but
we
will
not
dwell
on
my
fame
now
for
ever
lost
this
is
the
argument
of
my
he
paused
the
first
act
he
went
on
shows
mahomet
as
a
porter
to
kadijah
a
rich
widow
with
whom
his
uncle
placed
him
he
is
in
love
and
ambitious
driven
from
mecca
he
escapes
to
medina
and
dates
his
era
from
his
flight
the
in
the
second
act
he
is
a
prophet
founding
a
militant
religion
in
the
third
disgusted
with
all
things
having
exhausted
life
mahomet
conceals
the
manner
of
his
death
in
the
hope
of
being
regarded
as
a
god
last
effort
of
human
pride
now
you
shall
judge
of
my
way
of
expressing
in
sound
a
great
idea
for
which
poetry
could
find
no
adequate
expression
in
gambara
sat
down
to
the
piano
with
an
absorbed
gaze
and
his
wife
brought
him
the
mass
of
papers
forming
his
score
but
he
did
not
open
them
the
whole
opera
said
he
is
founded
on
a
bass
as
on
a
fruitful
soil
mahomet
was
to
have
a
majestic
bass
voice
and
his
wife
necessarily
had
a
contralto
kadijah
was
quite
old
twenty
attention
this
is
the
overture
it
begins
with
an
in
c
major
triple
time
do
you
hear
the
sadness
of
the
ambitious
man
who
is
not
satisfied
with
love
then
through
his
lamentation
by
a
transition
to
the
key
of
e
flat
common
time
we
hear
the
cries
of
the
epileptic
lover
his
fury
and
certain
warlike
phrases
for
the
mighty
charms
of
the
one
and
only
woman
give
him
the
impulse
to
multiplied
loves
which
strikes
us
in
now
as
you
hear
these
themes
do
you
not
catch
a
glimpse
of
mahomet
s
paradise
and
next
we
have
a
a
flat
major
time
that
might
expand
the
soul
that
is
least
susceptible
to
music
kadijah
has
understood
mahomet
then
kadijah
announces
to
the
populace
the
prophet
s
interviews
with
the
angel
gabriel
in

the
magistrates
and
priests
power
and

feeling
themselves
attacked
by
the
innovator
as
christ
and
socrates
also
attacked
effete
or
powers
and
religions
persecute
mahomet
and
drive
him
out
of
mecca
in

then
comes
my
beautiful

now
harkens
to

b

and
still
common

the
mass
of

gathers
like

the
false

has
begun
on
a

the
work
he
will
achieve
over
a

g

he
promises
the

universal

and
they

him
because

is

the

still
in
the

here
come
some
flourishes
in
c
major
from
the
brass
founded
on
the
harmony
but
strongly
marked
and
asserting
themselves
as
an
expression
of
the
first
triumphs
medina
has
gone
over
to
the
prophet
and
the
whole
army
marches
on
mecca
an
explosion
of
sound
in

the
whole
power
of
the
orchestra
is
worked
up
like
a
conflagration
every
instrument
is
employed
it
is
a
torrent
of
harmony
suddenly
the
is
interrupted
by
a
flowing
air
on
the

you
hear
the
last
strain
of
devoted
love
the
woman
who
had
upheld
the
great

dies
concealing
her
despair
dies
at
the
moment
of
triumph
for
him
in
whom
love
has
become
too
overbearing
to
be
content
with
one
woman
and
she
worships
him
enough
to
sacrifice
herself
to
the
greatness
of
the
man
who
is
killing
her
what
a
blaze
of
love
then
the
desert
rises
to
overrun
the
world
back
to

the
whole
strength
of
the

comes
in
again
collected
in
a
tremendous
quintet
grounded
on
the
fundamental
bass

he
is
dying
mahomet
is
he
has
exhausted
everything
now
he
craves
to
die
a

arabia
in

worships

prays
to
him
and
we
return
to
the
first
melancholy
strain
c

to
which
the
curtain
rose
now
do
you
not
discern
said
gambara
ceasing
to
play
and
turning
to
the
count
in
this
picturesque
and
vivid
music
abrupt
grotesque
or
melancholy
but
always
grand
the
complete
expression
of
the
life
of
an
epileptic
mad
for
enjoyment
unable
to
read
or
write
using
all
his
defects
as
turning
every
blunder
and
disaster
into
a
triumph
did
not
you
feel
a
sense
of
his
fascination
exerted
over
a
greedy
and
lustful
race
in
this
overture
which
is
an
epitome
of
the
opera
at
first
calm
and
stern
the
maestro
s
face
in
which
andrea
had
been
trying
to
read
the
ideas
he
was
uttering
in
inspired
tones
though
the
chaotic
flood
of
notes
afforded
no
clue
to
them
had
by
degrees
glowed
with
fire
and
assumed
an
impassioned
force
that
infected
marianna
and
the
cook
marianna
too
deeply
affected
by
certain
passages
in
which
she
recognized
a
picture
of
her
own
position
could
not
conceal
the
expression
of
her
eyes
from
andrea
gambara
wiped
his
brow
and
shot
a
glance
at
the
ceiling
of
such
fierce
energy
that
he
seemed
to
pierce
it
and
soar
to
the
very

the

expression

genius

astonishment

accustomed
to
it
gambara
contracted
his

to
such

was

reverts
to

strain
of
the

gambara
to
appreciate
this
prodigious
reaction
of
my
opera
on
itself
how
completely
it
all
rests
on
the
bass
it
is
thus
that
beethoven
composed
his
e
minor
symphony
but
his
heroic
work
is
purely
instrumental
whereas
here
my
heroic
phrase
is
worked
out
on
a

of
the
finest
human
voices
and
a
chorus
of
the

and
andrea
gazed
at
gambara
in
blank
amazement
though
at
first
he
had
been
struck
by
the
terrible
irony
of
the
situation
this
man
expressing
the
feelings
of
mahomet
s
wife
without
discovering
them
in
marianna
the
husband
s
hallucination
was
as
nothing
compared
with
the
composer
s
there
was
no
hint
even
of
a
poetical
or
musical
idea
in
the
hideous
cacophony
with
which
he
had
deluged
their
ears
the
first
principles
of
harmony
the
most
elementary
rules
of
composition
were
absolutely
alien
to
this
chaotic
structure
instead
of
the
scientifically
compacted
music
which
gambara
described
his
fingers
produced
sequences
of
fifths
sevenths
and
octaves
of
major
thirds
progressions
of
fourths
with
no
supporting
bass
a
medley
of
discordant
sounds
struck
out
haphazard
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
excruciating
to
the
least
sensitive
ear
it
is
difficult
to
give
any
idea
of
the
grotesque
performance
new
words
would
be
needed
to
describe
this
impossible
music
andrea
painfully
affected
by
this
worthy
man
s
madness
colored
and
stole
a
glance
at
marianna
while
she
turning
pale
and
looking
down
could
not
restrain
her
tears
in
the
midst
of
this
chaos
of
notes
gambara
had
every
now
and
then
given
vent
to
his
rapture
in
exclamations
of
delight
he
had
closed
his
eyes
in
ecstasy
had
smiled
at
his
piano
had
looked
at
it
with
a
frown
put
out
his
tongue
at
it
after
the
fashion
of
the
inspired
performer
in
short
was
quite
intoxicated
with
the
poetry
that
filled
his
brain
and
that
he
had
vainly
striven
to
utter
the
strange
discords
that
clashed
under
his
fingers
had
obviously
sounded
in
his
ears
like
celestial
harmonies
a
deaf
man
seeing
the
inspired
gaze
of
his
blue
eyes
open
on
another
world
the
rosy
glow
that
tinged
his
cheeks
and
above
all
the
heavenly
serenity
which
ecstasy
stamped
on
his
proud
and
noble
countenance
would
have
supposed
that
he
was
looking
on
at
the
improvisation
of
a
really
great
artist
the
illusion
would
have
been
all
the
more
natural
because
the
performance
of
this
mad
music
required
immense
executive
skill
to
achieve
such
fingering
gambara
must
have
worked
at
it
for
years
nor
were
his
hands
alone
employed
his
feet
were
constantly
at
work
with
complicated
pedaling
his
body
swayed
to
and
fro
the
perspiration
poured
down
his
face
while
he
toiled
to
produce
a
great
with
the
feeble
means
the
thankless
instrument
placed
at
his
command
he
stamped
puffed
shouted
his
fingers
were
as
swift
as
the
serpent
s
double
tongue
and
finally
at
the
last
crash
on
the
keys
he
fell
back
in
his
chair
resting
his
head
on
the
top
of
it
bacco
i
am
quite
stunned
said
the
count
as
he
left
the
house
a
child
dancing
on
the
keyboard
would
make
better
certainly
mere
chance
could
not
more
successfully
avoid
hitting
two
notes
in
concord
than
that
possessed
creature
has
done
during
the
past
hour
said
giardini
how
is
it
that
the
regular
beauty
of
marianna
s
features
is
not
spoiled
by
incessantly
hearing
such
a
hideous
medley
said
the
count
to
himself
marianna
will
certainly
grow
signor
she
must
be
saved
from
that
cried
giardini
yes
said
andrea
i
have
thought
of
that
still
to
be
sure
that
my
plans
are
not
based
on
error
i
must
confirm
my
doubts
by
another
experiment
i
will
return
and
examine
the
instruments
he
has
invented
after
dinner
we
will
have
a
little
supper
i
will
send
in
some
wine
and
little
the
cook
bowed
andrea
spent
the
following
day
in
superintending
the
arrangement
of
the
rooms
where
he
meant
to
install
the
artist
in
a
humble
home
in
the
evening
the
count
made
his
appearance
and
found
the
wine
according
to
his
instructions
set
out
with
some
care
by
marianna
and
giardini
gambara
proudly
exhibited
the
little
drums
on
which
lay
the
powder
by
means
of
which
he
made
his
observations
on
the
pitch
and
quality
of
the
sounds
emitted
by
his
instruments
you
see
said
he
by
what
simple
means
i
can
prove
the
most
important
propositions
acoustics
thus
can
show
me
the
analogous
effects
of
sound
on
every
object
of
its
impact
all
harmonies
start
from
a
common
centre
and
preserve
the
closest
relations
among
themselves
or
rather
harmony
like
light
is
decomposable
by
our
art
as
a
ray
is
by

he
then
displayed
the
instruments
constructed
in
accordance
with
his
laws
explaining
the
changes
he
had
introduced
into
their
constitution
and
finally
he
announced
that
to
conclude
this
preliminary
inspection
which
could
only
satisfy
a
superficial
curiosity
he
would
perform
on
an
instrument
that
contained
all
the
elements
of
a
complete
orchestra
and
which
he
called
a
if
it
is
the
machine
in
that
huge
case
which
brings
down
on
us
the
complaints
of
the
neighborhood
whenever
you
work
at
it
you
will
not
play
on
it
long
said
giardini
the
police
will
interfere
remember
that
if
that
poor
idiot
stays
in
the
room
said
gambara
in
a
whisper
to
the
count
i
can
not
possibly
andrea
dismissed
the
cook
promising
a
handsome
reward
if
he
would
keep
watch
outside
and
hinder
the
neighbors
or
the
police
from
interfering
giardini
who
had
not
stinted
himself
while
helping
gambara
to
wine
was
quite
willing
gambara
without
being
drunk
was
in
the
condition
when
every
power
of
the
brain
is
when
the
walls
of
the
room
are
transparent
when
the
garret
has
no
roof
and
the
soul
soars
in
the
empyrean
of
spirits
marianna
with
some
little
difficulty
removed
the
covers
from
an
instrument
as
large
as
a
grand
piano
but
with
an
upper
case
added
this
instrument
besides
this
second
body
and
its
keyboard
supported
the
openings
or
bells
of
various
wind
instruments
and
the
closed
funnels
of
a
few
organ
pipes
will
you
play
me
the
prayer
you
say
is
so
fine
at
the
end
of
your
opera
said
the
count
to
the
great
surprise
of
both
marianna
and
the
count
gambara
began
with
a
succession
of
chords
that
proclaimed
him
a
master
and
their
astonishment
gave
way
first
to
amazed
admiration
and
then
to
perfect
rapture
effacing
all
thought
of
the
place
and
the
performer
the
effects
of
a
real
orchestra
could
not
have
been
finer
than
the
voices
of
the
wind
instruments
which
were
like
those
of
an
organ
and
combined
wonderfully
with
the
harmonies
of
the
strings
but
the
unfinished
condition
of
the
machine
set
limits
to
the
composer
s
execution
and
his
idea
seemed
all
the
greater
for
often
the
very
perfection
of
a
work
of
art
limits
its
suggestiveness
to
the
recipient
soul
is
not
this
proved
by
the
preference
accorded
to
a
sketch
rather
than
a
finished
picture
when
on
their
trial
before
those
who
interpret
a
work
in
their
own
mind
rather
than
accept
it
rounded
off
and
complete
the
purest
and
serenest
music
that
andrea
had
ever
listened
to
rose
up
from
under
gambara
s
fingers
like
the
vapor
of
incense
from
an
altar
the
composer
s
voice
grew
young
again
and
far
from
marring
the
noble
melody
it
elucidated
it
supported
it
guided
it
just
as
the
feeble
and
quavering
voice
of
an
accomplished
reader
such
as
andrieux
for
instance
can
expand
the
meaning
of
some
great
scene
by
corneille
or
racine
by
lending
personal
and
poetical
feeling
this
really
angelic
strain
showed
what
treasures
lay
hidden
in
that
stupendous
opera
which
however
would
never
find
comprehension
so
long
as
the
musician
persisted
in
trying
to
explain
it
in
his
present
demented
state
his
wife
and
the
count
were
equally
divided
between
the
music
and
their
surprise
at
this
instrument
inside
which
a
stranger
might
have
fancied
an
invisible
chorus
of
girls
were
hidden
so
closely
did
some
of
the
tones
resemble
the
human
voice
and
they
dared
not
express
their
ideas
by
a
look
or
a
word
marianna
s
face
was
lighted
up
by
a
radiant
beam
of
hope
which
revived
the
glories
of
her
youth
this
renascence
of
beauty
with
the
luminous
glow
of
her
husband
s
genius
cast
a
shade
of
regret
on
the
count
s
exquisite
pleasure
in
this
mysterious
hour
you
are
our
good
genius
whispered
marianna
i
am
tempted
to
believe
that
you
actually
inspire
him
for
i
who
never
am
away
from
him
have
never
heard
anything
like
and
kadijah
s
farewell
cried
gambara
who
sang
the
which
he
had
described
the
day
before
as
sublime
and
which
now
brought
tears
to
the
eyes
of
the
lovers
so
perfectly
did
it
express
the
loftiest
devotion
of
love
who
can
have
taught
you
such
strains
cried
the
count
the
spirit
said
gambara
when
he
appears
all
is
fire
i
see
the
melodies
there
before
me
lovely
fresh
in
vivid
hues
like
flowers
they
beam
on
me
they
ring
out
and
i
listen
but
it
takes
a
long
long
time
to
reproduce
some
more
said
marianna
gambara
who
could
not
tire
played
on
without
effort
or
antics
he
performed
his
overture
with
such
skill
bringing
out
such
rich
and
original
musical
effects
that
the
count
was
quite
dazzled
and
at
last
believed
in
some
magic
like
that
commanded
by
paganini
and
liszt
a
style
of
execution
which
changes
every
aspect
of
music
as
an
art
by
giving
it
a
poetic
quality
far
above
musical
inventions
well
excellenza
and
can
you
cure
him
asked
giardini
as
andrea
came
out
i
shall
soon
find
out
replied
the
count
this
man
s
intellect
has
two
windows
one
is
closed
to
the
world
the
other
is
open
to
the
heavens
the
first
is
music
the
second
is
poetry
till
now
he
has
insisted
on
sitting
in
front
of
the
shuttered
window
he
must
be
got
to
the
other
it
was
you
giardini
who
first
started
me
on
the
right
track
by
telling
me
that
your
client
s
mind
was
clearer
after
drinking
a
few
glasses
of
yes
cried
the
cook
and
i
can
see
what
your
plan
if
it
is
not
too
late
to
make
the
thunder
of
poetry
audible
to
his
ears
in
the
midst
of
the
harmonies
of
some
noble
music
we
must
put
him
into
a
condition
to
receive
it
and
appreciate
it
will
you
help
me
to
intoxicate
gambara
my
good
fellow
will
you
be
none
the
worse
for
it
what
do
you
mean
excellenza
andrea
went
off
without
answering
him
laughing
at
the
acumen
still
left
to
this
cracked
wit
on
the
following
day
he
called
for
marianna
who
had
spent
the
morning
in
arranging
her
dress
a
simple
but
decent
outfit
on
which
she
had
spent
all
her
little
savings
the
transformation
would
have
destroyed
the
illusions
of
a
mere
dangler
but
andrea
s
caprice
had
become
a
passion
marianna
diverted
of
her
picturesque
poverty
and
looking
like
any
ordinary
woman
of
modest
rank
inspired
dreams
of
wedded
life
he
handed
her
into
a
hackney
coach
and
told
her
of
the
plans
he
had
in
his
head
and
she
approved
of
everything
happy
in
finding
her
admirer
more
lofty
more
generous
more
disinterested
than
she
had
dared
to
hope
he
took
her
to
a
little
apartment
where
he
had
allowed
himself
to
remind
her
of
his
good
offices
by
some
of
the
elegant
trifles
which
have
a
charm
for
the
most
virtuous
women
i
will
never
speak
to
you
of
love
till
you
give
up
all
hope
of
your
paolo
said
the
count
to
marianna
as
he
bid
her
at
the
rue
you
will
be
witness
to
the
sincerity
of
my
attempts
if
they
succeed
i
may
find
myself
unequal
to
keeping
up
my
part
as
a
friend
but
in
that
case
i
shall
go
far
away
marianna
though
i
have
firmness
enough
to
work
for
your
happiness
i
shall
not
have
so
much
as
will
enable
me
to
look
on
at
do
not
say
such
things
generosity
too
has
its
dangers
said
she
swallowing
down
her
tears
but
are
you
going
now
yes
said
andrea
be
happy
without
any
if
giardini
might
be
believed
the
new
treatment
was
beneficial
to
both
husband
and
wife
every
evening
after
his
wine
gambara
seemed
less
talked
more
and
with
great
lucidity
he
even
spoke
at
last
of
reading
the
papers
andrea
could
not
help
quaking
at
his
unexpectedly
rapid
success
but
though
his
distress
made
him
aware
of
the
strength
of
his
passion
it
did
not
make
him
waver
in
his
virtuous
resolve
one
day
he
called
to
note
the
progress
of
this
singular
cure
though
the
state
of
the
patient
at
first
gave
him
satisfaction
his
joy
was
dashed
by
marianna
s
beauty
for
an
easy
life
had
restored
its
brilliancy
he
called
now
every
evening
to
enjoy
calm
and
serious
conversation
to
which
he
contributed
lucid
and
well
considered
arguments
controverting
gambara
s
singular
theories
he
took
advantage
of
the
remarkable
acumen
of
the
composer
s
mind
as
to
every
point
not
too
directly
bearing
on
his
manias
to
obtain
his
assent
to
principles
in
various
branches
of
art
and
apply
them
subsequently
to
music
all
was
well
so
long
as
the
patient
s
brain
was
heated
with
the
fumes
of
wine
but
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
or
rather
lost
his
reason
he
was
a
monomaniac
once
more
however
paolo
was
already
more
easily
diverted
by
the
impression
of
outside
things
his
mind
was
more
capable
of
addressing
itself
to
several
points
at
a
time
andrea
who
took
an
artistic
interest
in
his
treatment
thought
at
last
that
the
time
had
come
for
a
great
experiment
he
would
give
a
dinner
at
his
own
house
to
which
he
would
invite
giardini
for
the
sake
of
keeping
the
tragedy
and
the
parody
side
by
side
and
afterwards
take
the
party
to
the
first
performance
of
le
he
had
seen
it
in
rehearsal
and
he
judged
it
well
fitted
to
open
his
patient
s
eyes
by
the
end
of
the
second
course
gambara
was
already
tipsy
laughing
at
himself
with
a
very
good
grace
while
giardini
confessed
that
his
culinary
innovations
were
not
worth
a
rush
andrea
had
neglected
nothing
that
could
contribute
to
this
twofold
miracle
the
wines
of
orvieto
and
of
montefiascone
conveyed
with
the
peculiar
care
needed
in
moving
them
lachrymachristi
and
giro
all
the
heady
liqueurs
of
cara
went
to
their
brains
with
the
intoxication
alike
of
the
grape
and
of
fond
memory
at
dessert
the
musician
and
the
cook
both
abjured
every
heresy
one
was
humming
a
by
rossini
and
the
other
piling
delicacies
on
his
plate
and
washing
them
down
with
maraschino
from
zara
to
the
prosperity
of
the
french
the
count
took
advantage
of
this
happy
frame
of
mind
and
gambara
allowed
himself
to
be
taken
to
the
opera
like
a
lamb
at
the
first
introductory
notes
gambara
s
intoxication
appeared
to
clear
away
and
make
way
for
the
feverish
excitement
which
sometimes
brought
his
judgment
and
his
imagination
into
perfect
harmony
for
it
was
their
habitual
disagreement
no
doubt
that
caused
his
madness
the
ruling
idea
of
that
great
musical
drama
appeared
to
him
no
doubt
in
its
noble
simplicity
like
a
lightning
flash
illuminating
the
utter
darkness
in
which
he
lived
to
his
unsealed
eyes
this
music
revealed
the
immense
horizons
of
a
world
in
which
he
found
himself
for
the
first
time
though
recognizing
it
as
that
he
had
seen
in
his
dreams
he
fancied
himself
transported
into
the
scenery
of
his
native
land
where
that
beautiful
italian
landscape
begins
at
what
napoleon
so
cleverly
described
as
the
of
the
alps
carried
back
by
memory
to
the
time
when
his
young
and
eager
brain
was
as
yet
untroubled
by
the
ecstasy
of
his
too
exuberant
imagination
he
listened
with
religious
awe
and
would
not
utter
a
single
word
the
count
respected
the
internal
travail
of
his
soul
till
twelve
gambara
sat
so
perfectly
motionless
that
the
frequenters
of
the
opera
house
took
him
no
doubt
for
what
he
was
a
man
drunk
on
their
return
andrea
began
to
attack
meyerbeer
s
work
in
order
to
wake
up
gambara
who
sat
sunk
in
the
state
common
in
drunkards
what
is
there
in
that
incoherent
score
to
reduce
you
to
a
condition
of
somnambulism
asked
andrea
when
they
got
out
at
his
house
the
story
of
le
to
be
sure
is
not
devoid
of
interest
and
holtei
has
worked
it
out
with
great
skill
in
a
drama
that
is
very
well
written
and
full
of
strong
and
pathetic
situations
but
the
french
librettist
has
contrived
to
extract
from
it
the
most
ridiculous
farrago
of
nonsense
the
absurdities
of
the
libretti
of
vesari
and
schikander
are
not
to
compare
with
those
of
the
words
of
robert
le
diable
it
is
a
dramatic
nightmare
which
oppresses
the
hearer
without
deeply
moving
him
and
meyerbeer
has
given
the
devil
a
too
prominent
part
bertram
and
alice
represent
the
contest
between
right
and
wrong
the
spirits
of
good
and
evil
this
antagonism
offered
a
splendid
opportunity
to
the
composer
the
sweetest
melodies
in
juxtaposition
with
harsh
and
crude
strains
was
the
natural
outcome
of
the
form
of
the
story
but
in
the
german
composer
s
score
the
demons
sing
better
than
the
saints
the
heavenly
airs
belie
their
origin
and
when
the
composer
abandons
the
infernal
motives
he
returns
to
them
as
soon
as
possible
fatigued
with
the
effort
of
keeping
aloof
from
them
melody
the
golden
thread
that
ought
never
to
be
lost
throughout
so
vast
a
plan
often
vanishes
from
meyerbeer
s
work
feeling
counts
for
nothing
the
heart
has
no
part
in
it
hence
we
never
come
upon
those
happy
inventions
those
artless
scenes
which
captivate
all
our
sympathies
and
leave
a
blissful
impression
on
the
soul
harmony
reigns
supreme
instead
of
being
the
foundation
from
which
the
melodic
groups
of
the
musical
picture
stand
forth
these
discordant
combinations
far
from
moving
the
listener
arouse
in
him
a
feeling
analogous
to
that
which
he
would
experience
on
seeing
a
hanging
to
a
thread
and
swaying
between
life
and
death
never
does
a
soothing
strain
come
in
to
mitigate
the
fatiguing
suspense
it
really
is
as
though
the
composer
had
had
no
other
object
in
view
than
to
produce
a
baroque
effect
without
troubling
himself
about
musical
truth
or
unity
or
about
the
capabilities
of
human
voices
which
are
swamped
by
this
flood
of
instrumental
silence
my
friend
cried
gambara
i
am
still
under
the
spell
of
that
glorious
chorus
of
hell
made
still
more
terrible
by
the
long
trumpets
a
new
method
of
instrumentation
the
broken
which
give
such
force
to
robert
s
scene
the
in
the
fourth
act
the
of
the
first
all
hold
me
in
the
grip
of
a
supernatural
power
no
not
even
gluck
s
declamation
ever
produced
so
prodigious
an
effect
and
i
am
amazed
by
such
skill
and
signor
maestro
said
andrea
smiling
allow
me
to
contradict
you
gluck
before
he
wrote
reflected
long
he
calculated
the
chances
and
he
decided
on
a
plan
which
might
be
subsequently
modified
by
his
inspirations
as
to
detail
but
hindered
him
from
ever
losing
his
way
hence
his
power
of
emphasis
his
declamatory
style
thrilling
with
life
and
truth
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
meyerbeer
s
learning
is
transcendent
but
science
is
a
defect
when
it
evicts
inspiration
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
in
this
opera
the
painful
toil
of
a
refined
craftsman
who
in
his
music
has
but
picked
up
thousands
of
phrases
out
of
other
operas
damned
or
forgotten
and
appropriated
them
while
extending
modifying
or
condensing
them
but
he
has
fallen
into
the
error
of
all
selectors
of
an
abuse
of
good
things
this
clever
harvester
of
notes
is
lavish
of
discords
which
when
too
often
introduced
fatigue
the
ear
till
those
great
effects
pall
upon
it
which
a
composer
should
husband
with
care
to
make
the
more
effective
use
of
them
when
the
situation
requires
it
these
enharmonic
passages
recur
to
satiety
and
the
abuse
of
the
plagal
cadence
deprives
it
of
its
religious
solemnity
i
know
of
course
that
every
musician
has
certain
forms
to
which
he
drifts
back
in
spite
of
himself
he
should
watch
himself
so
as
to
avoid
that
blunder
a
picture
in
which
there
were
no
colors
but
blue
and
red
would
be
untrue
to
nature
and
fatigue
the
eye
and
thus
the
constantly
recurring
rhythm
in
the
score
of
le
makes
the
work
as
a
whole
appear
monotonous
as
to
the
effect
of
the
long
trumpets
of
which
you
speak
it
has
long
been
known
in
germany
and
what
meyerbeer
offers
us
as
a
novelty
was
constantly
used
by
mozart
who
gives
just
such
a
chorus
to
the
devils
in
by
plying
gambara
meanwhile
with
fresh
libations
andrea
thus
strove
by
his
contradictoriness
to
bring
the
musician
back
to
a
true
sense
of
music
by
proving
to
him
that
his
mission
was
not
to
try
to
regenerate
an
art
beyond
his
powers
but
to
seek
to
express
himself
in
another
form
namely
that
of
poetry
but
my
dear
count
you
have
understood
nothing
of
that
stupendous
musical
drama
said
gambara
airily
as
standing
in
front
of
andrea
s
piano
he
struck
the
keys
listened
to
the
tone
and
then
seated
himself
meditating
for
a
few
minutes
as
if
to
collect
his
ideas
to
begin
with
you
must
know
said
he
that
an
ear
as
practised
as
mine
at
once
detected
that
labor
of
choice
and
setting
of
which
you
spoke
yes
the
music
has
been
selected
lovingly
from
the
storehouse
of
a
rich
and
fertile
imagination
wherein
learning
has
squeezed
every
idea
to
extract
the
very
essence
of
music
i
will
illustrate
the
he
rose
to
carry
the
candles
into
the
adjoining
room
and
before
sitting
down
again
he
drank
a
full
glass
of
giro
a
sardinian
wine
as
full
of
fire
as
the
old
wines
of
tokay
can
inspire
now
you
see
said
gambara
this
music
is
not
written
for
misbelievers
nor
for
those
who
know
not
love
if
you
have
never
suffered
from
the
virulent
attacks
of
an
evil
spirit
who
shifts
your
object
just
as
you
are
taking
aim
who
puts
a
fatal
end
to
your
highest
hopes
in
one
word
if
you
have
never
felt
the
devil
s
tail
whisking
over
the
world
the
opera
of
le
must
be
to
you
what
the
apocalypse
is
to
those
who
believe
that
all
things
will
end
with
them
but
if
persecuted
and
wretched
you
understand
that
spirit
of
evil
the
monstrous
ape
who
is
perpetually
employed
in
destroying
the
work
of
god
if
you
can
conceive
of
him
as
having
not
indeed
loved
but
ravished
an
almost
divine
woman
and
achieved
through
her
the
joy
of
paternity
as
so
loving
his
son
that
he
would
rather
have
him
eternally
miserable
with
himself
than
think
of
him
as
eternally
happy
with
god
if
finally
you
can
imagine
the
mother
s
soul
for
ever
hovering
over
the
child
s
head
to
snatch
it
from
the
atrocious
temptations
offered
by
its
father
even
then
you
will
have
but
a
faint
idea
of
this
stupendous
drama
which
needs
but
little
to
make
it
worthy
of
comparison
with
mozart
s
is
in
its
perfection
the
greater
i
grant
le
expresses
ideas
arouses
sensations
is
as
yet
the
only
musical
work
in
which
harmony
and
melody
are
combined
in
exactly
the
right
proportions
in
this
lies
its
only
superiority
for
is
the
richer
work
but
how
vain
are
such
comparisons
since
each
is
so
beautiful
in
its
own
way
to
me
suffering
as
i
do
from
the
demon
s
repeated
shocks
robert
spoke
with
greater
power
than
to
you
it
struck
me
as
being
at
the
same
time
vast
and
concentrated
thanks
to
you
i
have
been
transported
to
the
glorious
land
of
dreams
where
our
senses
expand
and
the
world
works
on
a
scale
which
is
gigantic
as
compared
with
he
was
silent
for
a
space
i
am
trembling
still
said
the
artist
from
the
four
bars
of
cymbals
which
pierced
to
my
marrow
as
they
opened
that
short
abrupt
introduction
with
its
solo
for
trombone
its
flutes
oboes
and
clarionet
all
suggesting
the
most
fantastic
effects
of
color
the
in
c
minor
is
a
foretaste
of
the
subject
of
the
evocation
of
the
ghosts
in
the
abbey
and
gives
grandeur
to
the
scene
by
anticipating
the
spiritual
struggle
i
gambara
pressed
the
keys
with
a
firm
hand
and
expanded
meyerbeer
s
theme
in
a
masterly
a
sort
of
outpouring
of
his
soul
after
the
manner
of
liszt
it
was
no
longer
the
piano
it
was
a
whole
orchestra
that
they
heard
the
very
genius
of
music
rose
before
them
that
was
worthy
of
mozart
he
exclaimed
see
how
that
german
can
handle
his
chords
and
through
what
masterly
modulations
he
raises
the
image
of
terror
to
come
to
the
dominant
i
can
hear
all
hell
in
it
the
curtain
rises
what
do
i
see
the
only
scene
to
which
we
gave
the
epithet
infernal
an
orgy
of
knights
in
sicily
in
that
chorus
in
f
every
human
passion
is
unchained
in
a
bacchanalian
every
thread
by
which
the
devil
holds
us
is
pulled
yes
that
is
the
sort
of
glee
that
comes
over
men
when
they
dance
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
they
make
themselves
giddy
what
there
is
in
that
chorus
against
that
chorus
the
reality
of
life
the
simple
life
of
virtue
stands
out
in
the
air
in
g
minor
sung
by
raimbaut
for
a
moment
it
refreshed
my
spirit
to
hear
the
simple
fellow
representative
of
verdurous
and
fruitful
normandy
which
he
brings
to
robert
s
mind
in
the
midst
of
his
drunkenness
the
sweet
influence
of
his
beloved
native
land
lends
a
touch
of
tender
color
to
this
gloomy
opening
then
comes
the
wonderful
air
in
c
major
supported
by
the
chorus
in
c
minor
so
expressive
of
the
subject
suis
he
immediately
breaks
out
the
wrath
of
the
prince
insulted
by
his
vassal
is
already
more
than
natural
anger
but
it
will
die
away
for
memories
of
his
childhood
come
to
him
with
alice
in
the
bright
and
graceful
in
a
major
can
you
not
hear
the
cries
of
the
innocent
dragged
into
this
infernal
drama
a
persecuted
creature
sang
gambara
who
made
the
consumptive
piano
sing
his
native
land
and
tender
emotions
have
come
back
to
him
his
childhood
and
its
memories
have
blossomed
anew
in
robert
s
heart
and
now
his
mother
s
shade
rises
up
bringing
with
it
soothing
religious
thoughts
it
is
religion
that
lives
in
that
beautiful
song
in
e
major
with
its
wonderful
harmonic
and
melodic
progression
in
the
words
car
dans
les
cieux
comme
sur
la
terre
sa
mere
va
prier
pour
lui
here
the
struggle
begins
between
the
unseen
powers
and
the
only
human
being
who
has
the
fire
of
hell
in
his
veins
to
enable
him
to
resist
them
and
to
make
this
quite
clear
as
bertram
comes
on
the
great
musician
has
given
the
orchestra
a
passage
introducing
a
reminiscence
of
raimbaut
s
ballad
what
a
stroke
of
art
what
cohesion
of
all
the
parts
what
solidity
of
structure
the
devil
is
there
in
hiding
but
restless
the
conflict
of
the
antagonistic
powers
opens
with
alice
s
terror
she
recognizes
the
devil
of
the
image
of
saint
michael
in
her
village
the
musical
subject
is
worked
out
through
an
endless
variety
of
phases
the
antithesis
indispensable
in
opera
is
emphatically
presented
in
a
noble
such
as
a
gluck
might
have
composed
between
bertram
and
robert
tu
se
sauras
jamais
a
quel
exces
je
t
aime
in
that
diabolical
c
minor
bertram
with
his
terrible
bass
begins
his
work
of
undermining
which
will
overthrow
every
effort
of
the
vehement
passionate
man
here
everything
is
appalling
will
the
crime
get
possession
of
the
criminal
will
the
executioner
seize
his
victim
will
sorrow
consume
the
artist
s
genius
will
the
disease
kill
the
patient
or
will
the
guardian
angel
save
the
christian
then
comes
the
the
gambling
scene
in
which
bertram
tortures
his
son
by
rousing
him
to
tremendous
emotions
robert
beggared
frenzied
searching
everything
eager
for
blood
fire
and
sword
is
his
own
son
in
this
mood
he
is
exactly
like
his
father
what
hideous
glee
we
hear
in
bertram
s
words
ris
de
tes
and
how
perfectly
the
venetian
comes
in
here
through
what
wonderful
transitions
the
diabolical
parent
is
brought
on
to
the
stage
once
more
to
make
robert
throw
the
dice
this
first
act
is
overwhelming
to
any
one
capable
of
working
out
the
subjects
in
his
very
heart
and
lending
them
the
breadth
of
development
which
the
composer
intended
them
to
call
forth
nothing
but
love
could
now
be
contrasted
with
this
noble
symphony
of
song
in
which
you
will
detect
no
monotony
no
repetitions
of
means
and
effects
it
is
one
but
many
the
characteristic
of
all
that
is
truly
great
and
natural
i
breathe
more
freely
i
find
myself
in
the
elegant
circle
of
a
gallant
court
i
hear
isabella
s
charming
phrases
fresh
but
almost
melancholy
and
the
female
chorus
in
two
divisions
and
in
with
a
suggestion
of
the
moorish
coloring
of
spain
here
the
terrifying
music
is
softened
to
gentler
hues
like
a
storm
dying
away
and
ends
in
the
florid
prettiness
of
a
duet
wholly
unlike
anything
that
has
come
before
it
after
the
turmoil
of
a
camp
full
of
errant
heroes
we
have
a
picture
of
love
poet
i
thank
thee
my
heart
could
not
have
borne
much
more
if
i
could
not
here
and
there
pluck
the
daisies
of
a
french
light
opera
if
i
could
not
hear
the
gentle
wit
of
a
woman
able
to
love
and
to
charm
i
could
not
endure
the
terrible
deep
note
on
which
bertram
comes
in
saying
to
his
son
je
la
when
robert
had
promised
the
princess
he
adores
that
he
will
conquer
with
the
arms
she
has
bestowed
on
him
the
hopes
of
the
gambler
cured
by
love
the
love
of
a
most
beautiful
woman
did
you
observe
that
magnificent
sicilian
with
her
hawk
s
eye
secure
of
her
prey
what
interpreters
that
composer
has
found
the
hopes
of
the
man
are
mocked
at
by
the
hopes
of
hell
in
the
tremendous
cry
toi
robert
de
and
are
not
you
struck
by
the
gloom
and
horror
of
those
notes
to
which
the
words
are
set
la
foret
we
find
here
all
the
sinister
spells
of
just
as
we
find
all
chivalry
in
the
chorus
with
the
spanish
lilt
and
in
the
march
tune
how
original
is
the
with
the
modulations
of
the
four
cymbals
tuned
to

c
g
how
elegant
is
the
call
to
the
lists
the
whole
movement
of
the
heroic
life
of
the
period
is
there
the
mind
enters
into
it
i
read
in
it
a
romance
a
poem
of
chivalry
the
is
now
finished
the
resources
of
music
would
seem
to
be
exhausted
you
have
never
heard
anything
like
it
before
and
yet
it
is
homogeneous
you
have
had
life
set
before
you
and
its
one
and
only
shall
i
be
happy
or
unhappy
is
the
philosopher
s
query
shall
i
be
saved
or
damned
asks
the
with
these
words
gambara
struck
the
last
chord
of
the
chorus
dwelt
on
it
with
a
melancholy
modulation
and
then
rose
to
drink
another
large
glass
of
giro
this
vintage
gave
his
face
a
deeper
flush
for
his
passionate
and
wonderful
sketch
of
meyerbeer
s
opera
had
made
him
turn
a
little
pale
that
nothing
may
be
lacking
to
this
composition
he
went
on
the
great
artist
has
generously
added
the
only
duet
permissible
for
a
devil
that
in
which
he
tempts
the
unhappy
troubadour
the
composer
has
set
jocosity
side
by
side
with
horror
a
jocosity
in
which
he
mocks
at
the
only
realism
he
had
allowed
himself
amid
the
sublime
imaginings
of
his
work
the
pure
calm
love
of
alice
and
raimbaut
and
their
life
is
overshadowed
by
the
forecast
of
evil
none
but
a
lofty
soul
can
feel
the
noble
style
of
these
airs
they
have
neither
the
superabundant
frivolity
of
italian
music
nor
the
vulgar
accent
of
french
commonplace
rather
have
they
the
majesty
of
olympus
there
is
the
bitter
laughter
of
a
divine
being
mocking
the
surprise
of
a
troubadour
himself
but
for
this
dignity
we
should
be
too
suddenly
brought
down
to
the
general
tone
of
the
opera
here
stamped
on
that
terrible
fury
of
diminished
sevenths
which
resolves
itself
into
an
infernal
waltz
and
finally
brings
us
face
to
face
with
the
demons
how
emphatically
bertram
s
couplet
stands
out
in
b
minor
against
that
diabolical
chorus
depicting
his
paternity
but
mingling
in
fearful
despair
with
these
demoniacal
strains
then
comes
the
delightful
transition
of
alice
s
reappearance
with
the
in
b
flat
i
can
still
hear
that
air
of
angelical
simplicity
the
nightingale
after
a
storm
thus
the
grand
leading
idea
of
the
whole
is
worked
out
in
the
details
for
what
could
be
more
perfectly
in
contrast
with
the
tumult
of
devils
tossing
in
the
pit
than
that
wonderful
air
given
to
alice
j
ai
quitte
la
the
golden
thread
of
melody
flows
on
side
by
side
with
the
mighty
harmony
like
a
heavenly
hope
it
is
embroidered
on
it
and
with
what
marvelous
skill
genius
never
lets
go
of
the
science
that
guides
it
here
alice
s
song
is
in
b
flat
leading
into
f
sharp
the
key
of
the
demon
s
chorus
do
you
hear
the
tremolo
in
the
orchestra
the
host
of
devils
clamor
for
robert
bertram
now
reappears
and
this
is
the
culminating
point
of
musical
interest
after
a
worthy
of
comparison
with
the
finest
work
of
the
great
masters
comes
the
fierce
conflict
in
e
flat
between
two
tremendous
forces
one
on
the
words
tu
me
on
a
diminished
seventh
the
other
on
that
sublime
f
ciel
est
avec
hell
and
the
crucifix
have
met
for
battle
next
we
have
bertram
threatening
alice
the
most
violent
pathos
ever
heard
the
spirit
of
evil
expatiating
complacently
and
as
usual
appealing
to
personal
interest
robert
s
arrival
gives
us
the
magnificent
unaccompanied
trio
in
a
flat
the
first
skirmish
between
the
two
rival
forces
and
the
man
and
note
how
clearly
that
is
expressed
said
gambara
epitomizing
the
scene
with
such
passion
of
expression
as
startled
andrea
all
this
avalanche
of
music
from
the
clash
of
cymbals
in
common
time
has
been
gathering
up
to
this
contest
of
three
voices
the
magic
of
evil
triumphs
alice
flies
and
you
have
the
duet
in
d
between
bertram
and
robert
the
devil
sets
his
talons
in
the
man
s
heart
he
tears
it
to
make
it
his
own
he
works
on
every
feeling
honor
hope
eternal
and
infinite
pleasures
he
displays
them
all
he
places
him
as
he
did
jesus
on
the
pinnacle
of
the
temple
and
shows
him
all
the
treasures
of
the
earth
the
storehouse
of
sin
he
nettles
him
to
flaunt
his
courage
and
the
man
s
nobler
mind
is
expressed
in
his
exclamation
des
chevaliers
de
ma
patrie
l
honneur
toujours
fut
le
soutien
and
finally
to
crown
the
work
the
theme
comes
in
which
sounded
the
note
of
fatality
at
the
beginning
thus
the
leading
strain
the
magnificent
call
to
the
deed
nonnes
qui
reposez
sous
cette
froide
pierre
m
the
career
of
the
music
gloriously
worked
out
is
gloriously
finished
by
the
of
the
bacchanalian
chorus
in
d
minor
this
indeed
is
the
triumph
of
hell
roll
on
harmony
and
wrap
us
in
a
thousand
folds
roll
on
bewitch
us
the
powers
of
darkness
have
clutched
their
prey
they
hold
him
while
they
dance
the
great
genius
born
to
conquer
and
to
reign
is
lost
the
devils
rejoice
misery
stifles
genius
passion
will
wreck
the
knight
and
here
gambara
improvised
a
of
his
own
on
the
bacchanalian
chorus
with
ingenious
variations
and
humming
the
air
in
a
melancholy
drone
as
if
to
express
the
secret
sufferings
he
had
known
do
you
hear
the
heavenly
lamentations
of
neglected
love
he
said
isabella
calls
to
robert
above
the
grand
chorus
of
knights
riding
forth
to
the
tournament
in
which
the
of
the
second
act
reappear
to
make
it
clear
that
the
third
act
has
all
taken
place
in
a
supernatural
sphere
this
is
real
life
again
this
chorus
dies
away
at
the
approach
of
the
hellish
enchantment
brought
by
robert
with
the
talisman
the
deviltry
of
the
third
act
is
to
be
carried
on
here
we
have
the
duet
with
the
viol
the
rhythm
is
highly
expressive
of
the
brutal
desires
of
a
man
who
is
omnipotent
and
the
princess
by
plaintive
phrases
tries
to
win
her
lover
back
to
moderation
the
musician
has
here
placed
himself
in
a
situation
of
great
difficulty
and
has
surmounted
it
in
the
loveliest
number
of
the
whole
opera
how
charming
is
the
melody
of
the
grace
pour
toi
all
the
women
present
understood
it
well
each
saw
herself
seized
and
snatched
away
on
the
stage
that
part
alone
would
suffice
to
make
the
fortune
of
the
opera
every
woman
felt
herself
engaged
in
a
struggle
with
some
violent
lover
never
was
music
so
passionate
and
so
dramatic
the
whole
world
now
rises
in
arms
against
the
reprobate
this
may
be
criticised
for
its
resemblance
to
that
of
but
there
is
this
immense
difference
in
isabella
we
have
the
expression
of
the
noblest
faith
a
true
love
that
will
save
robert
for
he
scornfully
rejects
the
infernal
powers
bestowed
on
him
while
don
giovanni
persists
in
his
unbelief
moreover
that
particular
fault
is
common
to
every
composer
who
has
written
a
since
mozart
the
to
is
one
of
those
classic
forms
that
are
invented
once
for
all
at
last
religion
wins
the
day
uplifting
the
voice
that
governs
worlds
that
invites
all
sorrow
to
come
for
consolation
all
repentance
to
be
forgiven
and
helped
the
whole
house
was
stirred
by
the
chorus
malheureaux
on
coupables
d
accourir
in
the
terrific
tumult
of
raving
passions
the
holy
voice
would
have
been
unheard
but
at
this
critical
moment
it
sounds
like
thunder
the
divine
catholic
church
rises
glorious
in
light
and
here
i
was
amazed
to
find
that
after
such
lavish
use
of
harmonic
treasure
the
composer
had
come
upon
a
new
vein
with
the
splendid
chorus
a
la
in
the
manner
of
handel
robert
rushes
on
with
his
heartrending
cry
je
pouvais
and
bertram
driven
by
the
infernal
decree
pursues
his
son
and
makes
a
last
effort
alice
has
called
up
the
vision
of
the
mother
and
now
comes
the
grand
trio
to
which
the
whole
opera
has
led
up
the
triumph
of
the
soul
over
matter
of
the
spirit
of
good
over
the
spirit
of
evil
the
strains
of
piety
prevail
over
the
chorus
of
hell
and
happiness
appears
glorious
but
here
the
music
is
weaker
i
only
saw
a
cathedral
instead
of
hearing
a
concert
of
angels
in
bliss
and
a
divine
prayer
consecrating
the
union
of
robert
and
isabella
we
ought
not
to
have
been
left
oppressed
by
the
spells
of
hell
we
ought
to
emerge
with
hope
in
our
heart
i
as
musician
and
a
catholic
wanted
another
prayer
like
that
in
i
should
have
liked
to
see
how
germany
would
contend
with
italy
what
meyerbeer
could
do
in
rivalry
with
rossini
however
in
spite
of
this
trifling
blemish
the
writer
can
not
say
that
after
five
hours
of
such
solid
music
a
parisian
prefers
a
bit
of
ribbon
to
a
musical
masterpiece
you
heard
how
the
work
was
applauded
it
will
go
through
five
hundred
performances
if
the
french
really
understand
that
music
it
is
because
it
expresses
ideas
the
count
put
in
no
it
is
because
it
sets
forth
in
a
definite
shape
a
picture
of
the
struggle
in
which
so
many
perish
and
because
every
individual
life
is
implicated
in
it
through
memory
ah
i
hapless
wretch
should
have
been
too
happy
to
hear
the
sound
of
those
heavenly
voices
i
have
so
often
dreamed
hereupon
gambara
fell
into
a
musical
improvising
the
most
lovely
melodious
and
harmonious
that
andrea
would
ever
hear
on
earth
a
divine
strain
divinely
performed
on
a
theme
as
exquisite
as
that
of
filii
et
but
graced
with
additions
such
as
none
but
the
loftiest
musical
genius
could
devise
the
count
sat
lost
in
keen
admiration
the
clouds
cleared
away
the
blue
sky
opened
figures
of
angels
appeared
lifting
the
veil
that
hid
the
sanctuary
and
the
light
of
heaven
poured
down
there
was
a
sudden
silence
the
count
surprised
at
the
cessation
of
the
music
looked
at
gambara
who
with
fixed
gaze
in
the
attitude
of
a
visionary
murmured
the
word
god
andrea
waited
till
the
composer
had
descended
from
the
enchanted
realm
to
which
he
had
soared
on
the
wings
of
inspiration
intending
to
show
him
the
truth
by
the
light
he
himself
would
bring
down
with
him
well
said
he
pouring
him
out
another
bumper
of
wine
and
clinking
glasses
with
him
this
german
has
you
see
written
a
sublime
opera
without
troubling
himself
with
theories
while
those
musicians
who
write
grammars
of
harmony
may
like
literary
critics
be
atrocious
then
you
do
not
like
my
music
i
do
not
say
so
but
if
instead
of
carrying
musical
principles
to
an
extreme
which
takes
you
too
far
you
would
simply
try
to
arouse
our
feelings
you
would
be
better
understood
unless
indeed
you
have
mistaken
your
vocation
you
are
a
great
what
cried
gambara
are
years
of
study
in
vain
am
i
to
learn
the
imperfect
language
of
men
when
i
have
the
key
to
the
heavenly
tongue
oh
if
you
are
right
i
should
no
no
you
are
great
and
strong
you
would
begin
life
again
and
i
would
support
you
we
would
show
the
world
the
noble
and
rare
alliance
of
a
rich
man
and
an
artist
in
perfect
sympathy
and
do
you
mean
it
asked
gambara
struck
with
amazement
as
i
have
told
you
you
are
a
poet
more
than
a
a
poet
a
poet
it
is
better
than
nothing
but
tell
me
truly
which
do
you
esteem
most
highly
mozart
or
homer
i
admire
them
on
your
honor
on
my
h
m
once
more
what
do
you
think
of
meyerbeer
and
byron
you
have
measured
them
by
naming
them
the
count
s
carriage
was
waiting
the
composer
and
his
noble
physician
ran
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
with
marianna
as
they
went
in
gambara
threw
himself
into
his
wife
s
arms
but
she
drew
back
a
step
and
turned
away
her
head
the
husband
also
drew
back
and
beamed
on
the
count
oh
monsieur
said
gambara
in
a
husky
voice
you
might
have
left
me
my
he
hung
his
head
and
then
fell
what
have
you
done
to
him
he
is
dead
drunk
cried
marianna
looking
down
at
her
husband
with
a
mingled
expression
of
pity
and
disgust
the
count
with
the
help
of
his
servant
picked
up
gambara
and
laid
him
on
his
bed
then
andrea
left
his
heart
exultant
with
horrible
gladness
the
count
let
the
usual
hour
for
calling
slip
past
next
day
for
he
began
to
fear
lest
he
had
duped
himself
and
had
made
this
humble
couple
pay
too
dear
for
their
improved
circumstances
and
added
wisdom
since
their
peace
was
destroyed
for
ever
at
last
giardini
came
to
him
with
a
note
from
marianna
come
she
wrote
the
mischief
is
not
so
great
as
you
so
cruelly
meant
it
to
excellenza
said
the
cook
while
andrea
was
making
ready
you
treated
us
splendidly
last
evening
but
apart
from
the
wine
which
was
excellent
your
steward
did
not
put
anything
on
the
table
that
was
worthy
to
set
before
a
true
epicure
you
will
not
deny
i
suppose
that
the
dish
i
sent
to
you
on
the
day
when
you
did
me
the
honor
to
sit
down
at
my
board
contained
the
quintessence
of
all
those
that
disgraced
your
magnificent
service
of
plate
and
when
i
awoke
this
morning
i
remembered
the
promise
you
once
made
me
of
a
place
as
henceforth
i
consider
myself
as
a
member
of
your
i
thought
of
the
same
thing
a
few
days
ago
replied
andrea
i
mentioned
you
to
the
secretary
of
the
austrian
embassy
and
you
have
permission
to
recross
the
alps
as
soon
as
you
please
i
have
a
castle
in
croatia
which
i
rarely
visit
there
you
may
combine
the
offices
of
butler
and
steward
with
two
hundred
crowns
a
year
your
wife
will
have
as
much
for
doing
all
the
rest
of
the
work
you
may
make
all
the
experiments
you
please
anima
that
is
to
say
on
the
stomach
of
my
vassals
here
is
a
cheque
for
your
traveling
giardini
kissed
the
count
s
hand
after
the
neapolitan
fashion
excellenza
said
he
i
accept
the
cheque
but
beg
to
decline
the
place
it
would
dishonor
me
to
give
up
my
art
by
losing
the
opinion
of
the
most
perfect
epicures
who
are
certainly
to
be
found
in
when
andrea
arrived
at
gambara
s
lodgings
the
musician
rose
to
welcome
him
my
generous
friend
said
he
with
the
utmost
frankness
you
either
took
advantage
last
evening
of
the
weakness
of
my
brain
to
make
a
fool
of
me
or
else
your
brain
is
no
more
capable
of
standing
the
test
of
the
heady
liquors
of
our
native
latium
than
mine
is
i
will
assume
this
latter
hypothesis
i
would
rather
doubt
your
digestion
than
your
heart
be
this
as
it
may
henceforth
i
drink
no
more
wine
for
ever
the
abuse
of
good
liquor
last
evening
led
me
into
much
guilty
folly
when
i
remember
that
i
very
nearly
he
gave
a
glance
of
terror
at
marianna
as
to
the
wretched
opera
you
took
me
to
hear
i
have
thought
it
over
and
it
is
after
all
music
written
on
ordinary
lines
a
mountain
of
notes
et
it
is
but
the
dregs
of
the
nectar
i
can
drink
in
deep
draughts
as
i
reproduce
the
heavenly
music
that
i
hear
it
is
a
patchwork
of
airs
of
which
i
could
trace
the
origin
the
passage
a
la
is
too
much
like
a
bit
of
handel
the
chorus
of
knights
is
closely
related
to
the
scotch
air
in
dame
in
short
if
this
opera
is
a
success
it
is
because
the
music
is
borrowed
from
everybody
s
so
it
ought
to
be
popular
i
will
say
to
you
my
dear
friend
i
have
had
some
ideas
seething
in
my
brain
since
the
morning
that
only
wait
to
soar
up
to
god
on
the
wings
of
song
but
i
wished
to
see
you
i
must
ask
forgiveness
of
the
muse
we
shall
meet
at
dinner
but
no
wine
at
any
rate
none
for
me
i
am
firmly
resolved
i
give
him
up
cried
andrea
flushing
red
and
you
restore
my
sense
of
conscience
said
marianna
i
dared
not
appeal
to
it
my
friend
my
friend
it
is
no
fault
of
ours
he
does
not
want
to
be
six
years
after
this
in
january
such
artists
as
were
so
unlucky
as
to
damage
their
wind
or
stringed
instruments
generally
took
them
to
the
rue
to
a
squalid
and
horrible
house
where
on
the
fifth
floor
dwelt
an
old
italian
named
gambara
for
five
years
past
he
had
been
left
to
himself
deserted
by
his
wife
he
had
gone
through
many
misfortunes
an
instrument
on
which
he
had
relied
to
make
his
fortune
and
which
he
called
a
had
been
sold
by
order
of
the
court
on
the
public
square
place
du
chatelet
together
with
a
cartload
of
music
paper
scrawled
with
notes
the
day
after
the
sale
these
scores
had
served
in
the
market
to
wrap
up
butter
fish
and
fruit
thus
the
three
grand
operas
of
which
the
poor
man
would
boast
but
which
an
old
neapolitan
cook
who
was
now
but
a
patcher
up
of
broken
meats
declared
to
be
a
heap
of
nonsense
were
scattered
throughout
paris
on
the
trucks
of
costermongers
but
at
any
rate
the
landlord
had
got
his
rent
and
the
bailiffs
their
expenses
according
to
the
neapolitan
cook
who
warmed
up
for
the
of
the
rue
the
fragments
left
from
the
most
sumptuous
dinners
in
paris
signora
gambara
had
gone
off
to
italy
with
a
milanese
nobleman
and
no
one
knew
what
had
become
of
her
worn
out
with
fifteen
years
of
misery
she
was
very
likely
ruining
the
count
by
her
extravagant
luxury
for
they
were
so
devotedly
adoring
that
in
all
his
life
giardini
could
recall
no
instance
of
such
a
passion
towards
the
end
of
that
very
january
one
evening
when
giardini
was
chatting
with
a
girl
who
had
come
to
buy
her
supper
about
the
divine
marianna
so
poor
so
beautiful
so
heroically
devoted
and
who
had
nevertheless
gone
the
way
of
them
all
the
cook
his
wife
and
the
saw
coming
towards
them
a
woman
fearfully
thin
with
a
sunburned
dusty
face
a
nervous
walking
skeleton
looking
at
the
numbers
and
trying
to
recognize
a
house
la
exclaimed
the
cook
marianna
recognized
giardini
the
erewhile
cook
in
the
poor
fellow
she
saw
without
wondering
by
what
series
of
disasters
he
had
sunk
to
keep
a
miserable
shop
for
secondhand
food
she
went
in
and
sat
down
for
she
had
come
from
fontainebleau
she
had
walked
fourteen
leagues
that
day
after
begging
her
bread
from
turin
to
paris
she
frightened
that
terrible
trio
of
all
her
wondrous
beauty
nothing
remained
but
her
fine
eyes
dimmed
and
sunken
the
only
thing
faithful
to
her
was
misfortune
she
was
welcomed
by
the
skilled
old
instrument
mender
who
greeted
her
with
unspeakable
joy
why
here
you
are
my
poor
marianna
said
he
warmly
during
your
absence
they
sold
up
my
instrument
and
my
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
kill
the
fatted
calf
for
the
return
of
the
samaritan
but
giardini
contributed
the
fag
end
of
a
salmon
the
trull
paid
for
wine
gambara
produced
some
bread
signora
giardini
lent
a
cloth
and
the
unfortunates
all
supped
together
in
the
musician
s
garret
when
questioned
as
to
her
adventures
marianna
would
make
no
reply
she
only
raised
her
beautiful
eyes
to
heaven
and
whispered
to
giardini
he
married
a
dancer
and
how
do
you
mean
to
live
said
the
girl
the
journey
has
ruined
you
and
and
made
me
an
old
woman
said
marianna
no
that
is
not
the
result
of
fatigue
or
hardship
but
of
and
why
did
you
never
send
your
man
here
any
money
asked
the
girl
marianna
s
only
answer
was
a
look
but
it
went
to
the
woman
s
heart
she
is
proud
with
a
vengeance
she
exclaimed
and
much
good
it
has
done
her
she
added
in
giardini
s
ear
all
that
year
musicians
took
especial
care
of
their
instruments
and
repairs
did
not
bring
in
enough
to
enable
the
poor
couple
to
pay
their
way
the
wife
too
did
not
earn
much
by
her
needle
and
they
were
compelled
to
turn
their
talents
to
account
in
the
lowest
form
of
employment
they
would
go
out
together
in
the
dark
to
the
champs
elysees
and
sing
duets
which
gambara
poor
fellow
accompanied
on
a
wretched
guitar
on
the
way
marianna
who
on
these
expeditions
covered
her
head
with
a
sort
of
veil
of
coarse
muslin
would
take
her
husband
to
the
grocer
s
shop
in
the
faubourg
and
give
him
two
or
three
thimblefuls
of
brandy
to
make
him
tipsy
otherwise
he
could
not
play
then
they
would
stand
up
together
in
front
of
the
smart
people
sitting
on
the
chairs
and
one
of
the
greatest
geniuses
of
the
time
the
unrecognized
orpheus
of
modern
music
would
perform
passages
from
his
operas
pieces
so
remarkable
that
they
would
extract
a
few
from
parisian
supineness
when
some
of
comic
operas
happened
to
be
sitting
there
and
did
not
recognize
from
what
work
they
were
taken
he
would
question
the
woman
dressed
like
a
greek
priestess
who
held
out
a
of
stamped
metal
in
which
she
collected
charity
i
say
my
dear
what
is
that
music
out
of
the
opera
of
marianna
would
reply
as
rossini
composed
an
opera
called
the
amateur
would
say
to
his
wife
sitting
at
his
side
what
a
pity
it
is
that
they
will
never
give
us
at
the
italiens
any
operas
by
rossini
but
those
we
know
that
is
really
fine
music
and
gambara
would
smile
only
a
few
days
since
this
unhappy
couple
had
to
pay
the
trifling
sum
of
francs
as
arrears
for
rent
for
the
in
which
they
lived
resigned
the
grocer
would
not
give
them
credit
for
the
brandy
with
which
marianna
plied
her
husband
to
enable
him
to
play
gambara
was
consequently
so
unendurably
bad
that
the
ears
of
the
wealthy
were
irresponsive
and
the
tin
remained
empty
it
was
nine
o
clock
in
the
evening
a
handsome
italian
the
principessa
massimilla
de
varese
took
pity
on
the
poor
creatures
she
gave
them
forty
francs
and
questioned
them
discerning
from
the
woman
s
thanks
that
she
was
a
venetian
prince
emilio
would
know
the
history
of
their
woes
and
marianna
told
it
making
no
complaints
of
god
or
men
madame
said
gambara
as
she
ended
for
he
was
sober
we
are
victims
of
our
own
superiority
my
music
is
good
but
as
soon
as
music
transcends
feeling
and
becomes
an
idea
only
persons
of
genius
should
be
the
hearers
for
they
alone
are
capable
of
responding
to
it
it
is
my
misfortune
that
i
have
heard
the
chorus
of
angels
and
believed
that
men
could
understand
the
strains
the
same
thing
happens
to
women
when
their
love
assumes
a
divine
aspect
men
can
not
understand
this
speech
was
well
worth
the
forty
francs
bestowed
by
massimilla
she
took
out
a
second
gold
piece
and
told
marianna
she
would
write
to
andrea
marcosini
do
not
write
to
him
madame
exclaimed
marianna
and
god
grant
you
to
always
be
beautiful
let
us
provide
for
them
said
the
princess
to
her
husband
for
this
man
has
remained
faithful
to
the
ideal
which
we
have
as
he
saw
the
gold
pieces
gambara
shed
tears
and
then
a
vague
reminiscence
of
old
scientific
experiments
crossed
his
mind
and
the
hapless
composer
as
he
wiped
his
eyes
spoke
these
words
which
the
circumstances
made
pathetic
water
is
a
product
of
