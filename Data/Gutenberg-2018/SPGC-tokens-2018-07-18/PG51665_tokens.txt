chapter
i
towards
the
close
of
a
day
of
intense
heat
about
the
middle
of
the
month
of
june
a
party
consisting
of
many
persons
might
be
seen
straggling
over
the
plain
which
extends
southwards
from
the
fort
of
adoni
and
which
almost
entirely
consists
of
the
black
alluvial
deposit
familiarly
known
in
india
under
the
name
of
cotton
the
leader
was
a
man
perhaps
about
fifty
years
of
age
he
rode
a
powerful
dekhan
horse
of
great
spirit
but
whose
usual
fiery
comportment
was
tamed
by
the
severe
exertion
he
had
undergone
from
the
miry
roads
through
which
he
had
travelled
the
greater
part
of
the
day
indeed
he
began
to
show
evident
symptoms
of
weariness
and
extricated
himself
from
every
succeeding
muddy
they
were
very
less
power
his
handsome
housings
too
were
soiled
with
dirt
and
the
figure
of
his
rider
which
merits
some
description
was
splashed
from
head
to
foot
it
has
been
already
stated
that
he
was
a
man
of
advanced
age
his
face
which
was
wrapped
up
as
well
as
his
head
in
thick
folds
of
muslin
in
order
to
protect
them
from
the
scorching
heat
of
the
sun
showed
a
dark
complexion
much
pitted
with
the
smallpox
but
his
eyes
were
very
large
and
of
that
intense
black
which
is
but
rarely
seen
even
among
the
natives
of
india
and
which
appeared
to
flash
with
a
sudden
light
when
any
stumble
of
his
gallant
horse
provoked
an
impatient
jerk
of
the
bridle
and
a
volley
of
curses
upon
the
mud
and
the
road
if
such
it
could
be
called
his
dress
was
of
suit
which
had
been
once
magnificent
but
which
soiled
and
tarnished
as
it
was
he
had
chosen
perhaps
to
wear
as
a
mark
of
his
rank
and
thus
to
ensure
respect
from
the
people
of
the
country
which
might
have
been
denied
to
money
alone
it
was
open
at
the
breast
and
under
the
shirt
of
muslin
worn
within
the
alkhaluk
or
upper
garment
a
broad
rough
chest
could
be
seen
fair
earnest
of
the
power
of
him
we
describe
a
handsome
shawl
was
girded
around
his
waist
and
his
somewhat
loose
trousers
were
thrust
into
a
pair
of
yellow
leather
boots
which
appeared
to
be
of
persian
workmanship
over
his
shoulder
was
a
gold
belt
which
supported
a
sword
but
this
in
reality
was
confined
to
the
waist
by
the
shawl
we
have
mentioned
and
appeared
more
for
ornament
than
use
a
bright
steel
axe
with
a
steel
handle
hung
at
his
on
the
right
hand
and
the
of
a
pistol
much
enriched
with
chased
silver
peeped
forth
on
the
left
among
the
fringe
of
the
velvet
covering
of
the
soft
saddle
upon
which
he
rode
a
richly
ornamented
shield
was
bound
to
his
back
by
a
soft
leather
strap
passing
over
his
chest
and
the
shield
itself
which
hung
low
rested
between
his
back
and
the
cantle
of
the
saddle
and
partly
served
as
a
support
in
truth
soiled
and
bespattered
as
he
was
abdool
rhyman
khan
was
a
striking
figure
in
those
broad
plains
and
in
his
own
person
appeared
a
sufficient
protection
to
those
who
followed
him
but
he
was
not
the
only
armed
person
of
the
party
six
or
seven
horsemen
immediately
followed
him
own
retainers
not
mounted
so
well
nor
dressed
so
expensively
as
the
khan
himself
but
still
men
of
gallant
bearing
and
the
party
could
they
have
kept
together
would
have
presented
a
very
martial
and
imposing
appearance
at
some
distance
behind
the
horsemen
was
a
palankeen
apparently
heavily
laden
for
the
bearers
though
there
were
as
many
as
sixteen
changed
very
frequently
and
could
but
ill
struggle
through
the
muddy
road
into
which
at
every
step
they
sunk
deeply
nor
did
the
cheering
exclamations
of
those
who
were
not
under
the
poles
of
the
palankeen
appear
to
have
much
effect
in
quickening
the
pace
of
those
who
carried
it
and
it
was
very
evident
that
they
were
nearly
exhausted
and
not
fit
to
travel
much
further
in
the
rear
of
all
was
a
string
of
five
camels
which
required
the
constant
attention
of
the
drivers
to
prevent
their
slipping
and
falling
under
their
burdens
and
with
these
were
a
number
of
persons
some
on
foot
carrying
loads
and
a
few
mounted
on
ponies
who
were
the
servants
of
the
khan
and
were
urging
on
the
beasts
and
those
laden
with
the
cooking
utensils
as
rapidly
as
it
was
possible
to
proceed
in
the
now
darkness
behind
all
were
two
led
horses
of
much
beauty
whose
attendant
grooms
conducted
them
through
the
firmest
parts
of
the
road
alla
alla
cried
one
of
those
mounted
on
a
stout
pony
was
in
fact
the
cook
of
the
khan
that
i
zoolficar
should
ever
have
been
seduced
to
leave
the
noble
city
of
hyderabad
and
to
travel
this
unsainted
road
at
such
a
time
of
year
ai
moula
ali
he
continued
invoking
his
patron
saint
deliver
us
speedily
from
this
darkness
grant
that
no
rain
may
fall
upon
this
already
impassable
road
i
should
never
survive
a
night
in
this
jungle
what
say
you
daood
we
ever
to
reach
the
munzil
are
we
ever
to
be
released
from
this
jehanum
where
we
are
enduring
torment
before
our
time
speak
o
respectable
man
thou
saidst
thou
knew
st
the
footnote
stage
so
i
do
o
coward
what
is
the
use
of
filling
our
ears
with
these
fretful
complaints
hath
not
the
munificence
of
the
khan
provided
thee
with
a
stout
beast
which
with
the
blessing
of
the
prophet
will
carry
thee
quickly
to
thy
journey
s
end
was
it
not
the
khan
s
pleasure
to
pass
adoni
where
we
might
have
rested
comfortably
for
the
night
and
are
we
who
eat
his
salt
to
grumble
at
what
he
does
when
we
saw
that
the
khanum
sahib
may
her
name
be
honoured
was
willing
to
travel
on
peace
then
for
it
is
hard
to
attend
to
thy
prating
and
pick
one

way
among
these
cursed

feminine
of
khan
as

of
beg
well
i
am
silent
replied
the
other
but
my
mind
misgives
me
that
we
never
reach
the
munzil
and
shall
be
obliged
to
put
up
in
one
of
these
wretched
villages
where
the
kafir
inhabitants
never
kill
meat
and
we
shall
have
to
eat
dry
bread
or
perhaps
dry
rice
which
is
worse
after
this
ah
thou
art
no
soldier
zoolfoo
cried
another
fellow
who
was
walking
beside
him
or
thou
wouldst
not
talk
thus
how
wouldst
thou
like
to
have
nothing
for
two
days
and
then
perhaps
a
stale
crust
or
a
handful
of
cold
rice
and
be
glad
to
thank
the
provider
of
good
for
that
wouldst
thou
no
more
i
pray
thee

nasur
cried
the
cook
visions
of
starvation
apparently
overpowering
him
no
more
i
beseech
thee
methinks
thy
words
have
already
had
a
bad
effect
on
the
lower
part
of
my
stomach
and
that
it
begins
to
reproach
me
for
a
lack
of
its
usual
sustenance
i
tell
thee
man
i
can
put
to
myself
no
idea
of
starvation
at
all
i
was
never
able
to
keep
the
rumzan
for
which
i
pray
to
be
pardoned
and
am
obliged
to
pay
heavily
every
year
for
some
one
to
keep
it
for
me
grace
abound
to
him
i
pray
alla
and
the
prophet
that
the
khan
may
strike
off
somewhere
in
search
of
a
roof
for
the
the
khan
had
stopped
the
increasing
darkness
or
rather
gloom
there
was
still
somewhat
of
daylight
remaining
and
the
sun
had
not
long
set
muttering
of
thunder
and
the
more
and
more
vivid
flashes
of
lightning
proceeding
from
an
intensely
black
and
heavy
cloud
which
occupied
the
whole
of
the
horizon
before
him
were
enough
to
cause
anxiety
as
to
his
proceeding
further
or
not
a
hard
or
tolerably
firm
road
would
have
relieved
this
but
the
track
upon
which
they
journeyed
became
almost
worse
as
he
proceeded
and
the
man
he
had
sent
on
some
little
distance
in
advance
to
observe
the
best
passage
for
the
horses
appeared
to
be
guiding
his
with
increased
difficulty
i
was
an
ass
and
the
son
of
an
ass
to
leave
adoni
muttered
the
khan
but
it
is
of
no
use
to
regret
this
now
had
better
be
done
is
the
question
my
poor
motee
he
continued
addressing
his
horse
thou
too
art
worn
out
and
none
of
thy
old
fire
left
in
thee
how
my
son
wouldst
thou
carry
me
yet
further
and
he
patted
his
neck
the
noble
beast
appeared
to
understand
him
for
he
replied
to
the
caress
by
a
low
whinny
which
he
followed
up
by
a
loud
neigh
and
looked
as
he
neighed
far
and
wide
over
the
plain
ay
thou
see
st
nothing
motee
true
it
is
there
is
no
village
in
sight
yet
surely
one
can
not
be
far
off
where
if
they
will
admit
us
we
may
get
food
and
shelter
what
thinkest
thou
ibrahim
he
continued
addressing
one
of
his
retainers
are
we
near
any
habitation
peer
o
moorshid
replied
the
man
i
know
not
i
never
travelled
this
road
before
except
once
many
years
ago
and
then
i
was
with
the
army
we
did
not
think
much
of
the
road
true
friend
answered
the
khan
but
now
we
have
need
to
think
by
the
soul
of
mohamed
the
cloud
beyond
us
threatens
much
and
i
fear
for
the
khanum
she
is
ill
used
to
such
travelling
as
this
but
she
is
a
soldier
s
wife
now
and
i
must
teach
her
to
bear
rough
the
palkee
will
be
with
us
presently
and
i
doubt
not
the
bearers
well
know
the
country
khodawund
said
another
of
the
horsemen
true
i
had
not
thought
of
them
perhaps
when
it
arrives
it
would
be
advisable
to
stop
a
little
to
take
breath
and
then
again
set
a
few
moments
brought
the
bearers
and
their
burden
to
where
the
khan
stood
and
a
few
hurried
questions
were
put
to
them
by
him
as
to
the
distance
to
the
next
village
the
road
and
the
accommodation
they
were
likely
to
find
for
so
large
a
party
huzrut
said
the
naik
of
the
bearers
you
have
but
little
choice
we
did
not
think
the
road
would
have
been
so
bad
as
this
or
we
would
never
have
left
the
town
or
allowed
you
to
proceed
but
here
we
are
and
we
must
help
to
extricate
you
from
the
difficulty
into
which
we
have
brought
you
to
return
is
impossible
there
is
no
village
at
which
you
could
rest
as
you
know
before
us
are
two
one
not
far
off
over
yonder
rising
lord
can
even
see
the
trees
another
beyond
that
about
a
coss
and
a
half
to
which
if
the
lady
can
bear
the
journey
we
will
take
her
as
there
is
a
good
bazaar
and
every
accommodation
my
lord
will
reward
us
with
a
sheep
if
we
carry
her
safely
surely
surely
said
the
khan
ye
shall
have
two
and
we
will
travel
a
short
stage
as
ye
must
be
tired
so
what
say
you
my
soul
he
cried
to
the
inmate
of
the
palankeen
you
have
the
choice
of
a
comfortable
supper
and
a
dry
lodging
or
no
supper
and
perhaps
no
roof
over
your
head
you
see
what
it
is
to
follow
the
fortunes
of
a
let
no
thought
of
me
trouble
you
replied
a
low
and
sweet
voice
from
the
palankeen
let
the
bearers
and
yourself
decide
i
am
content
how
say
you
then
gopal
let
us
smoke
a
pipe
all
round
and
we
will
carry
you
to
the
large
village
replied
the
naik
tis
well
not
be
long
about
it
i
doubt
not
we
shall
be
all
the
better
for
a
short
fire
was
quickly
kindled
every
one
dismounted
from
his
beast
and
all
collected
into
groups
tobacco
was
soon
found
the
hookas
lighted
and
the
gurgling
sound
of
of
them
arose
among
the
party
a
smoke
of
tobacco
in
this
manner
gives
almost
new
life
to
a
native
of
india
the
trouble
of
the
journey
or
the
work
is
for
awhile
forgotten
and
after
a
fresh
girding
up
of
the
loins
and
invocation
of
the
prophet
or
their
patron
goddess
as
the
parties
may
be
hindoo
or
mohamedan
the
undertaking
is
resumed
with
fresh
spirit
after
a
short
pause
the
whole
party
was
again
in
motion
no
one
had
however
observed
the
extremely
threatening
appearance
of
the
sky
the
cloud
which
had
been
still
now
began
to
rise
gently
few
small
clouds
were
seen
as
it
were
to
break
away
from
the
mass
and
scurry
along
the
face
of
the
heavens
apparently
close
to
their
heads
and
far
below
the
larger
ones
which
hung
heavily
above
them
these
were
followed
very
quickly
by
others
the
lightning
increased
in
vividness
at
every
flash
and
what
was
at
first
confined
to
the
cloud
which
has
been
mentioned
now
spread
itself
gradually
all
over
the
heavens
one
blaze
of
light
as
it
were
at
a
signal
given
by
a
rocket
thrown
up
from
behind
the
cloud
before
them
in
spite
of
appearances
however
they
hurried
on
it
will
be
a
wild
night
observed
the
khan
replacing
and
binding
tighter
the
muslin
about
his
head
and
face
as
he
spoke
he
pointed
to
the
horizon
where
was
seen
a
dull
reddish
cloud
to
an
unpractised
eye
it
looked
like
one
of
the
dusky
evening
clouds
but
on
closer
and
more
attentive
observation
it
was
clearly
seen
to
rise
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
extending
right
and
left
very
rapidly
i
beg
to
represent
said
daood
khan
who
had
come
from
behind
that
there
is
a
group
of
trees
yonder
not
far
from
the
road
and
if
my
memory
serves
me
well
there
should
be
an
old
hut
in
it
will
my
lord
go
thither
it
is
well
spoken
daood
said
his
master
lead
there
was
no
a
all
was
quite
still
not
even
a
cricket
or
grasshopper
chirped
among
the
grass
it
seemed
as
though
nature
could
scarcely
breathe
so
intense
was
the
closeness
alla
alla
i
shall
choke
if
there
is
no
wind
said
the
fat
cook
fanning
himself
with
the
end
of
a
handkerchief
you
will
have
enough
presently
said
nasur
inshalla
exclaimed
one
of
the
camel
drivers
the
toofans
of
the
carnatic
are
alas
sighed
the
cook
and
wished
himself
anywhere
but
in
the
carnatic
at
last
a
low
moaning
was
heard
distant
sound
as
if
of
rushing
water
the
rack
above
them
redoubled
its
pace
and
went
fearfully
fast
every
instant
increased
the
blackness
on
each
side
and
behind
they
could
no
longer
see
any
separate
clouds
above
but
one
dense
brown
black
ropy
mass
hurrying
onward
impelled
by
the
mighty
wind
soon
nothing
was
visible
but
a
bright
line
all
round
the
horizon
except
in
front
where
the
wall
of
red
dust
which
proved
that
the
previous
rains
had
not
extended
far
beyond
where
they
were
every
moment
grew
higher
and
higher
and
came
nearer
and
nearer
they
increased
their
speed
to
gain
the
trees
which
were
discernible
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
them
once
there
said
the
khan
we
can
make
some
shelter
for
ourselves
with
the
walls
of
the
tents
passed
round
the
footnote
storms
no
one
replied
to
him
each
was
thinking
of
the
storm
and
what
would
happen
when
it
came
the
horses
even
felt
the
oppression
and
snorted
violently
at
intervals
as
though
they
wished
to
throw
it
off
at
last
a
few
leaves
flew
up
in
the
air
and
some
lapwings
which
had
been
nestling
under
the
stones
by
the
wayside
rose
and
made
a
long
flight
to
leeward
with
loud
screamings
as
though
to
avoid
the
wind
one
little
whirlwind
succeeded
to
another
small
quantities
of
leaves
and
dry
grass
were
everywhere
seen
flying
along
near
the
ground
over
the
plain
the
body
of
dust
approached
nearer
and
seemed
to
swallow
up
everything
in
it
they
anxiously
watched
its
progress
in
the
hope
that
it
would
lessen
in
fury
ere
it
approached
them
for
they
could
see
the
trees
through
the
gloom
against
the
bright
line
of
the
horizon
apparently
at
a
great
distance
disappearing
one
by
one
meanwhile
the
roaring
increased
the
roar
of
the
wind
and
that
of
the
thunder
were
fearfully
mingled
together
amidst
this
there
arose
a
shrill
scream
from
the
palankeen
the
fair
inmate
had
no
longer
been
able
to
bear
the
evident
approach
of
the
tempest
the
khan
was
at
her
side
in
a
moment
cheer
thee
my
rose
he
cried
a
little
further
and
we
shall
reach
a
friendly
grove
of
trees
the
road
is
harder
now
so
exert
yourselves
he
continued
to
the
bearers
five
rupees
if
you
reach
the
trees
ere
the
wind
is
upon
us
the
men
redoubled
their
pace
but
in
vain
they
still
wanted
half
the
quarter
of
the
mile
when
the
storm
burst
with
one
fearful
flash
of
lightning
so
as
almost
to
blind
them
and
to
cause
the
whole
to
stagger
backward
a
blast
met
them
which
if
they
had
withstood
they
had
been
more
than
men
the
palankeen
rocked
to
and
fro
tottered
under
their
failing
support
and
fell
at
last
heavily
to
the
ground
there
was
no
mischief
done
but
it
was
impossible
to
proceed
further
they
must
abide
the
storm
where
they
stood
in
the
open
plain
and
now
it
came
in
pitiless
earnest
as
if
the
whole
power
of
the
winds
of
heaven
had
been
collected
and
poured
forth
bodily
upon
one
spot
and
that
where
they
stood
did
it
appear
to
them
while
the
dust
increasing
in
volume
every
instant
was
so
choking
that
no
one
dared
to
open
his
mouth
to
speak
a
word
the
horses
and
camels
instinctively
turned
their
backs
to
the
wind
and
stood
motionless
and
the
men
at
last
forcing
the
camels
to
sit
down
crouched
behind
them
to
obtain
some
kind
of
shelter
from
the
raging
storm
thus
they
remained
for
some
time
at
last
a
drop
of
rain
and
another
they
could
not
see
it
coming
amidst
the
dust
and
it
was
upon
them
ere
they
were
aware
of
it
they
were
drenched
in
an
instant
now
indeed
began
a
strife
of
elements
the
thunder
roared
without
ceasing
one
moment
there
was
no
thunder
for
any
particular
was
a
continued
flare
a
continued
roar
the
wind
the
rain
and
the
thunder
made
a
fearful
din
and
even
the
stout
heart
of
the
khan
sunk
within
him
it
can
not
last
he
said
it
did
the
country
appeared
at
last
like
a
lake
shown
irregularly
by
the
blue
flare
of
the
lightning
two
hours
or
nearly
so
did
they
endure
all
this
the
tempest
moderated
at
length
and
they
proceeded
it
was
now
quite
dark
where
is
ibrahim
asked
one
suddenly
ay
where
is
he
said
another
several
shouted
his
name
but
there
was
no
reply
ibrahim
cried
the
khan
what
of
him
he
must
be
gone
to
the
trees
go
one
of
ye
and
call
him
if
he
be
there
the
man
diverged
from
the
road
and
was
soon
lost
in
the
darkness
but
in
a
short
time
an
exclamation
of
surprise
or
of
terror
they
could
not
say
which
came
clearly
towards
them
the
khan
stopped
in
another
instant
the
man
had
rejoined
them
alla
alla
cried
he
gasping
for
breath
come
and
see
see
what
shouted
the
khan
ibrahim
was
his
only
reply
and
they
followed
him
rapidly
they
could
hardly
distinguish
what
it
was
that
the
man
pointed
out
but
what
appeared
like
a
heap
at
first
in
the
darkness
soon
resolved
itself
into
the
form
of
a
man
and
horse
the
khan
dismounted
and
approached
he
called
to
him
by
name
but
there
was
no
answer
he
felt
the
was
quite
dead
horse
and
man
had
fallen
beneath
the
stroke
of
the
lightning
we
can
do
nothing
now
said
the
khan
alas
that
so
good
a
man
and
one
who
has
so
often
fought
beside
me
should
have
thus
fallen
praise
be
to
alla
what
an
escape
we
have
had
it
was
his
destiny
said
another
who
could
have
averted
it
and
they
rode
on
but
slowly
for
the
road
was
undistinguishable
from
the
ground
on
each
side
except
where
a
hedge
of
thorns
had
been
placed
to
fence
in
some
field
here
those
who
were
on
foot
fared
very
badly
for
the
thorns
which
had
fallen
or
had
been
broken
off
from
branches
had
mixed
with
the
mud
and
sorely
hurt
their
naked
feet
the
rain
continued
to
pour
in
torrents
and
the
incessant
flare
of
the
lightning
which
revealed
the
track
every
now
and
then
seemed
to
sweep
the
ground
before
them
nearly
blinding
both
horse
and
man
it
showed
at
times
for
an
instant
the
struggles
both
were
making
in
the
now
deeper
mire
they
reached
the
smaller
village
at
last
there
were
only
three
or
four
miserable
houses
and
in
the
state
they
were
there
was
but
little
inducement
to
remain
in
want
of
food
and
shelter
till
the
morning
so
taking
with
them
much
against
his
inclination
one
of
the
villagers
as
a
guide
whom
they
could
understand
as
he
was
a
mohamedan
and
some
rags
soaked
with
oil
tied
on
the
end
of
a
stick
to
serve
as
a
torch
they
once
more
set
forward
they
had
now
scarcely
three
miles
to
travel
but
these
seemed
interminable
the
rude
torch
could
not
withstand
the
deluge
of
rain
which
poured
upon
it
and
after
a
struggle
for
life
it
went
out
there
remained
only
the
light
of
the
lightning
the
guide
however
was
of
use
now
threatened
now
encouraged
by
the
khan
he
showed
where
the
firmest
footing
was
to
be
obtained
and
piloted
the
little
cavalcade
through
the
almost
sea
of
mud
and
water
in
a
manner
which
showed
them
that
they
would
have
fared
but
ill
without
his
aid
at
last
o
welcome
sight
a
light
was
seen
to
glimmer
for
awhile
amidst
the
gloom
it
disappeared
twinkled
again
appeared
to
flit
at
a
little
distance
and
was
seen
no
more
what
was
that
rahdaree
asked
the
khan
one
would
think
it
was
some
wild
spirit
s
lamp
abroad
on
this
unblessed
it
is
the
village
noble
sir
said
the
man
simply
we
have
no
evil
spirits
we
are
near
our
home
then
it
can
not
be
far
not
a
we
have
a
small
river
to
cross
and
then
we
reach
the
a
river
yes
noble
khan
a
small
one
there
is
no
water
to
but
the
khan
s
mind
misgave
him
it
must
be
full
he
said
to
himself
after
this
rain
how
can
it
be
otherwise
every
hollow
we
have
passed
has
become
a
roaring
stream
but
we
shall
see
ya
moula
ali
he
exclaimed
aloud
i
vow
a
gift
to
all
the
priests
of
thy
shrine
if
thou
wilt
protect
me
and
mine
through
this
footnote
guide
they
had
not
gone
much
further
before
the
dull
sound
of
the
river
was
heard
but
too
plainly
even
above
the
wind
and
the
thunder
which
now
roared
only
at
intervals
one
and
all
were
fairly
terrified
and
that
there
should
be
such
an
end
to
their
really
manful
struggles
through
the
tempest
disheartened
them
but
no
one
spoke
till
they
arrived
at
the
brink
where
through
the
gloom
could
be
seen
a
muddy
torrent
rushing
along
with
fearful
rapidity
it
is
not
deep
said
the
guide
it
is
dog
of
a
kafir
cried
the
khan
thou
hast
deceived
us
to
get
us
away
from
thy
miserable
village
by
alla
thou
deservest
to
be
put
to
death
for
this
my
life
is
in
your
hands
o
khan
returned
the
man
behold
to
prove
my
words
i
will
venture
in
if
any
one
will
accompany
me
alone
it
is
useless
to
attempt
it
will
no
one
go
with
me
but
one
and
all
hesitated
the
gloom
the
uncertainty
and
the
dread
of
death
alike
prevailed
cowards
exclaimed
the
khan
dare
ye
not
do
for
him
whose
salt
you
eat
that
which
this
poor
fellow
is
ready
to
undertake
because
i
only
reproached
him
with
inhospitality
cowards
and
faithless
ye
are
worse
than
i
am
no
woman
or
coward
said
daood
khan
doggedly
come
he
added
to
the
guide
as
thou
art
ready
to
go
give
me
thy
hand
and
step
in
in
the
name
of
the
most
merciful
bismilla
daood
thou
hast
a
stout
will
remember
thee
for
this
step
on
in
the
name
of
alla
and
the
twelve
imaums
halloo
when
thou
art
on
the
other
they
entered
the
water
carefully
holding
tightly
each
other
s
hand
and
each
planting
his
foot
firmly
ere
he
ventured
to
withdraw
the
other
the
torrent
was
frightfully
rapid
and
it
required
all
the
power
of
two
very
strong
men
to
bear
up
against
it
but
at
length
the
shallow
water
was
gained
and
a
joyful
shout
from
the
other
side
told
to
the
khan
and
his
expectant
party
that
the
passage
had
been
made
in
safety
now
make
haste
and
get
a
torch
and
bring
some
people
with
you
shouted
the
khan
meanwhile
we
will
make
preparations
for
not
much
time
elapsed
before
a
few
persons
were
seen
approaching
the
river
s
bank
from
the
village
bearing
several
torches
which
in
despite
of
the
wind
and
the
rain
being
all
fed
with
oil
blazed
brightly
and
cast
their
light
far
and
wide
the
khan
had
been
endeavouring
to
persuade
his
wife
to
trust
herself
to
his
horse
instead
of
to
the
palankeen
in
crossing
the
river
and
after
some
representation
of
its
superior
safety
he
had
succeeded
she
was
standing
by
him
closely
veiled
when
the
torches
appeared
on
the
other
side
what
she
saw
however
of
the
stream
as
revealed
fully
by
the
light
caused
an
instant
change
in
her
resolution
she
was
terrified
by
the
waters
and
indeed
they
were
very
awful
to
look
on
as
the
muddy
boiling
mass
hurried
past
appearing
as
was
the
case
to
increase
in
volume
every
moment
there
is
no
time
to
lose
shouted
the
villagers
observing
there
was
irresolution
among
the
party
the
water

rising
will
soon
be
the

the

my
soul
cried
the
khan
in
despair
the
bearers
will
never
carry
you
through
that
i
dare
not
i
should
faint
in
the
midst
even
now
my
heart
is
sick
within
me
and
my
eyes
fail
me
as
i
look
on
the
waters
replied
the
lady
khodawund
said
the
naik
of
the
bearers

her
to
us
on
our
lives

reaches
the
other
side

so
then

i
trust
thee
and
thy
party
only
land
her
safely
and
thou
shalt
be
well
the
lady
again
entered
the
palankeen
both
doors
were
opened
in
case
of
danger
the
stoutest
of
the
bearers
were
selected
and
the
naik
put
himself
at
the
head
jey
bhowanee
cried
one
and
all
and
they
entered
the
raging

from
the
villagers
and
from

attendants
as
the
gallant
fellows
bore
up
stoutly
against
the
torrent
oil
was
poured
upon
the
torches
and
the
river
blazed
under
the
light
the
khan
was
close
behind
on
his
gallant
horse
which
snorting
and
uneasy
was
very
difficult
to
guide
there
was
not
a

on
either
bank

did
not
beat
with
almost
fearful
anxiety
for
the
water
appeared
to

the

it
required
the
exertions
of
all
the

keep
it

a

were
the
cries

animated
and

them
and
the
passage
was
accomplished
all
but
a
few
yards
when
the
water
suddenly
leading
bearers
sank
almost
up
to
their
chests
trials
were
made
on
either
side
but
the
water
was
deeper
than
where
they
stood
the
eddy

scooped
out
the
hollow

had
crossed

the

on
your
shoulders

they
advanced
as
they
shouted
the
invocation
but
careful
as
they
were
who
could
see
beneath
those
muddy
waters
there
was
a
large
which
the
leading
bearer
placed
his
foot
it
was
steady
when
he
first
tried
it
but
as
he
withdrew
the
other
it
rolled
over
beneath
his
weight
and
what
he
bore
he
tottered
stumbled
made
a
desperate
effort
to
recover
himself
but
in
vain
he
fell
headlong
into
the
current
the
palankeen
could
not
be
supported
and
but
one
wild
piercing
shriek
was
heard
from
the
wife
of
the
khan
as
it
plunged
into
the
water

the
khan
in

he

seen

lost
to

for
ever
and
throwing
himself
from
his
horse
encumbered
as
he
was
he
would
have
been
drowned
but
for
one
of
the
bearers
who
supported
him
to
the
brink
and
assisted
by
the
rest
who
immediately
recovered
the
palankeen
bore
him
rapidly
to
the
village
chapter
ii
the
confusion
which
ensued
is
indescribable
the
few
persons
on
the
bank
of
the
river
rushed
hither
and
thither
without
any
definite
object
and
screams
from
some
women
who
had
followed
the
men
from
the
village
out
of
curiosity
rent
the
air
and
added
to
the
wildness
of
the
scene
on
a
sudden
an
exclamation
broke
from
a
youth
who
stood
not
far
off
and
before
they
could
turn
to
see
what
had
occasioned
it
he
had
darted
from
the
spot
and
precipitated
himself
into
the
waters
cries
of
he
will
be
lost
he
will
be
lost
flew
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
a
dozen
turbans
were
unwound
and
thrown
to
him
from
the
brink
as
he
still
struggled
with
the
current
supporting
the
slight
and
inanimate
form
of
her
who
was
supposed
to
have
been
swept
down
the
stream
at
first
without
waiting
for
a
moment
to
answer
the
numberless
queries
which
were
showered
upon
him
by
the
spectators
or
to
ascertain
whether
the
senseless
form
he
bore
had
life
in
it
or
not
he
hastily
covered
the
features
from
view
and
declining
the
assistance
of
some
old
crones
who
thronged
around
him
he
pressed
through
them
and
hurried
with
the
utmost
rapidity
to
his
home
those
who
partly
carried
and
partly
supported
the
khan
himself
conducted
him
to
the

public
apartment

pillows
as
could
most
readily
be
found
they
proceeded
to
divest
him
of
his
wet
garments
arms
and
boots
with
an
officious
zeal
which
in
spite
of
the
protestations
of
his
servant
daood
all
persisted
in
exerting
the
khan
suffered
all
patiently
apparently
with
almost
unconsciousness
only
at
times
uttering
low
moans
and
interjections
which
showed
his
thoughts
to
be
absorbed
in
the
fate
of
her
he
deemed
lost
for
ever
gradually
however
the
kind
attentions
of
his
servant
whose
sobs
could
not
be
repressed
as
he
bent
over
him
in
his
attempts
to
remove
his
inner
vest
which
the
others
had
hesitated
to
touch
recalled
his
wandering
senses
and
staring
wildly
about
him
he
demanded
to
know
where
he
was
instantly
however
a
fresh
recollection
of
the
scene
which
had
passed
flashed
into
his
mind
and
all
the
words
he
could
find
utterance
for
were
an
incoherent
demand
of
daood
if
the
khanum
had
been
found
alas
peer
o
moorshid
was
the
reply
your
slave
saw
nothing
he
assisted
my
lord
here
was
she
not
instantly
rescued
what
were
all
of
ye
doing
that
she
ever
passed
from
your
sight
exclaimed
the
khan
holy
alla
give
her
back
to
me
or
i
shall
go
mad
he
continued
starting
up
and
rushing
from
the
spot
into
the
air
followed
by
his
attendant
and
a
few
of
the
others
who
lingered
about
distractedly
the
khan
hurried
to
the
and
in
the
misery
of
despair
began
to
search
for
the
body
of
his
wife
he
ran
from
place
to
place
shouting
her
name
he
looked
everywhere
for
any
trace
of
her
remains
while
his
faithful
attendant
in
vain
besought
him
to
withdraw
from
the
spot
for
that
further
search
was
unavailing
his
words
were
unheeded
all
the
khan
saw
through
the
almost
inky
darkness
was
the
faint
glimmer
of
the
wild
waters
hurrying
past
him
and
the
only
sounds
he
heard
were
their
dull
and
sullen
roar
above
which
arose
the
shouts
of
his
servants
on
the
other
side
and
at
intervals
a
shrill
neigh
from
one
of
the
horses
two
or
three
persons
only
remained
about
the
and
these
seemed
unacquainted
with
what
had
occurred
all
who
had
seen
it
had
dispersed
when
the
young
man
bore
off
the
insensible
girl
he
had
rescued
after
some
time
of
fruitless
search
the
khan
silently
relinquished
it
and
sadly
and
slowly
turned
towards
the
village
meanwhile
the
young
man
we
have
mentioned
carried
the
lady
with
the
utmost
speed
he
was
able
to
his
own
home
a
respectable
house
situated
on
the
other
side
of
the
village
from
where
the
khan
was
without
ceremony
he
entered
the
zenana
still
bearing
her
in
his
arms
to
the
astonishment
of
an
elderly
dame
his
mother
and
several
other
women
servants
and
others
who
happened
to
be
there
and
to
whom
the
news
of
the
disaster
was
being
brought
piecemeal
as
first
one
and
then
another
hurried
in
with
parts
of
the
story
holy
prophet
what
hast
thou
brought
kasim
ali
cried
his
mother
a
woman
by
your
soul
say
how
is
this
didst
thou
get
her
too
tis
the
khan
s
wife
and
she
is
dead
cried
many
at
once
i
care
not
what
she
is
cried
the
young
man
by
the
blessing
of
alla
i
saw
her
and
brought
her
out
of
the
water
she
is
still
warm
and
perhaps
not
dead
see
what
ye
can
do
speedily
to
recover
her
she
is
as
beautiful
as
a
peri
but
no
matter
ye
can
do
nothing
while
i
am
here
so
i
leave
whatever
kasim
s
thoughts
might
have
been
he
had
sense
enough
not
to
give
them
utterance
and
leaving
the
fair
creature
to
their
care
he
again
hurried
forth
to
see
whether
he
could
render
further
assistance
to
the
unfortunate
travellers
left
among
the
women
of
the
house
the
khan
s
wife
became
an
object
of
the
deepest
interest
to
these
really
kind
people
her
wet
clothes
were
removed
cloths
were
heated
and
applied
to
her
body
she
was
rubbed
and
kneaded
all
over
the
wet
was
wrung
from
her
hair
and
after
awhile
they
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
a
gentle
sigh
escape
her
and
another
at
intervals
holy
alla
cried
one
of
the
women
at
last
she
has
opened
her
the
light
was
apparently
too
much
for
them
for
she
shut
them
again
and
relapsed
into
stupor
but
the
respiration
continued
and
the
alarm
that
she
had
died
ceased
to
exist
gradually
very
gradually
she
regained
consciousness
and
ere
many
hours
had
elapsed
she
was
in
a
deep
sleep
freed
from
all
anxiety
regarding
her
lord
whom
on
her
first
recovery
she
had
presumed
was
lost
the
khan
and
daood
had
scarcely
again
reached
the
chowrie
when
a
large
body
of
men
with
torches
shouting
joyfully
approached
it
daood
s
heart
leaped
to
his
mouth
she
can
not
have
been
saved
he
cried
as
he
advanced
to
meet
them
cried
a
dozen
voices
she
has
and
is
in
the
patél
s
footnote
the
chief
or
magistrate
of
a
village
without
any
ceremony
they
broke
in
upon
the
unfortunate
khan
who
sat
or
rather
lay
absorbed
in
his
grief
alone
the
memory
of
his
wife
had
come
vividly
over
him
and
when
he
raised
his
head
on
their
intrusion
his
wet
cheek
very
plainly
told
that
his
manly
sorrow
had
found
vent
cried
daood
panting
for
breath
echoed
kasim
do
not
mock
me
i
pray
you
said
the
khan
sadly
for
grief
is
devouring
my
heart
and
i
am
sad
even
to
tears
and
yet
your
faces
have
joy
in
them
she
can
not
live
that
would
be
too
much
to
hope
speak
and
tell
truth
weep
not
noble
khan
said
kasim
she
lives
by
the
blessing
of
alla
is
safe
in
my
own
mother
s
apartments
and
such
rude
care
as
we
can
give
her
or
such
accommodation
as
our
poor
house
affords
she
shall
the
khan
started
to
his
feet
thou
dost
not
mock
me
then
youth
ya
alla
i
did
not
deserve
this
who
saved
her
by
the
soul
of
the
prophet
any
recompense
in
the
power
of
abdool
rhyman
even
to
half
his
wealth
shall
be
his
who
rescued
her
he
stands
before
thee
o
khan
cried
daood
who
had
recovered
his
speech
it
was
that
brave
fellow
who
rushed
into
the
water
and
rescued
her
even
while
my
lord
was
being
carried
in
an
instant
rank
and
power
were
forgotten
and
the
khan
impelled
by
his
emotion
ere
kasim
could
prevent
him
had
folded
him
in
a
sincere
and
grateful
embrace
nay
he
would
have
fallen
at
his
feet
but
the
young
kasim
disengaging
himself
prevented
it
and
drew
back
not
so
protector
of
the
poor
he
cried
your
slave
has
but
done
what
any
man
would
do
in
a
like
case
kasim
ali
patél
would
have
disgraced
himself
had
he
turned
from
that
helpless
being
as
she
lay
in
such
peril
on
the
the
khan
was
struck
with
admiration
of
the
young
man
who
with
excited
looks
and
proud
yet
tempered
bearing
drew
himself
up
as
he
uttered
the
last
words
and
indeed
the
young
patél
was
a
noble
figure
to
look
on
he
had
not
attempted
to
change
his
clothes
since
his
rescue
of
the
lady
but
had
thrown
off
his
upper
garment
he
was
therefore
naked
to
the
waist
and
his
body
was
only
partially
covered
by
the
dark
blanket
he
had
cast
over
his
shoulders
his
tall
and
muscular
frame
was
fully
developed
and
the
broad
chest
long
and
full
arms
and
narrow
waist
showed
the
power
which
existed
to
be
called
into
exertion
when
opportunity
required
nor
was
his
countenance
less
worthy
of
remark
although
he
had
hardly
attained
manhood
yet
the
down
on
his
upper
lip
and
chin
which
was
darkening
fast
proved
that
perhaps
twenty
years
had
passed
over
him
and
added
not
a
little
to
his
manly
appearance
his
dark
expressive
eyes
which
glistened
proudly
as
the
khan
regarded
him
a
high
aquiline
nose
large
nostrils
expanding
from
the
excitement
he
had
been
in
exquisitely
white
and
regular
teeth
and
added
to
all
a
fair
fairer
than
the
generality
of
his
countrymen
could
boast
that
he
was
perhaps
of
gentle
blood
which
indeed
his
courteous
manner
would
have
inclined
most
observers
to
determine
thou
art
a
noble
fellow
youth
cried
the
khan
and
i
would
again
meet
thee
as
a
brother
embrace
me
therefore
for
by
the
soul
of
my
father
i
could
love
thee
as
one
but
tell
me
saved
her
is
she
safe
in
your
house
a
few
words
explained
all
the
eddy
in
its
force
had
cast
the
lady
upon
a
bank
below
almost
immediately
after
her
immersion
and
fortunately
with
her
head
above
the
water
had
she
not
been
terrified
by
the
shock
so
as
to
lose
her
consciousness
she
would
have
been
able
to
drag
herself
upon
the
dry
land
though
she
could
not
have
got
to
shore
as
part
of
the
river
flowed
round
the
bank
on
which
she
had
been
cast
thus
she
had
continued
in
very
imminent
danger
until
rescued
for
any
wave
or
slight
rise
of
the
water
must
have
carried
her
down
the
stream
and
who
in
that
darkness
and
confusion
would
ever
again
have
seen
her
gradually
therefore
the
khan
was
brought
to
comprehend
the
whole
matter
and
as
it
ought
his
thankfulness
towards
the
young
kasim
increased
at
every
explanation
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
however
that
he
was
the
less
anxious
about
her
who
had
been
saved
he
had
been
with
some
difficulty
restrained
from
at
once
proceeding
to
the
patél
s
house
and
desisted
only
when
daood
and
his
companion
declared
that
such
a
proceeding
would
be
attended
with
risk
to
the
lady
she
too
had
been
assured
that
he
was
safe
they
said
and
in
this
comforting
certainty
overcome
by
fatigue
and
excitement
she
had
fallen
asleep
but
that
is
no
reason
why
my
lord
should
not
come
to
my
poor
abode
said
kasim
this
open
room
is
to
so
damp
a
night
and
my
lord
has
been
i
need
but
little
pressing
he
replied
and
rose
to
accompany
him
arrived
at
the
house
which
though
only
a
large
cabin
was
yet
of
superior
extent
and
comfort
of
appearance
to
the
rest
in
the
village
the
khan
found
that
every
preparation
the
inmates
had
in
their
power
had
been
made
for
him
a
carpet
was
spread
and
upon
it
was
laid
a
comfortable
cotton
mattress
this
was
covered
with
a
clean
fine
sheet
and
some
very
luxurious
pillows
placed
against
the
wall
invited
him
to
repose
fatigue
rapidly
asserted
its
mastery
over
even
the
khan
s
iron
frame
he
had
been
assured
by
kasim
s
mother
that
his
lady
slept
sweetly
and
an
ample
repast
concluded
he
attempted
for
a
time
to
converse
with
the
young
patél
but
without
much
success
the
young
man
took
in
truth
but
little
interest
in
the
replies
the
khan
himself
was
abstracted
sleep
gradually
overpowered
him
and
he
sunk
down
upon
the
bedding
in
total
unconsciousness
after
a
short
time
after
seeing
him
covered
so
as
to
prevent
the
cold
and
damp
coming
to
him
the
young
patél
left
him
to
the
care
of
daood
and
withdrew
his
own
bedding
was
in
an
inner
room
of
the
house
near
to
the
apartments
of
the
women
and
his
mother
heard
him
gently
pass
to
it
and
joined
him
ere
he
had
lain
down
my
blessings
on
thee
my
brave
boy
cried
the
old
lady
melting
into
tears
at
the
mingled
thoughts
of
what
might
have
been
her
son
s
danger
and
his
gallant
conduct
my
blessing
and
the
blessing
of
allah
on
thee
for
this
thou
art
thy
father
s
son
indeed
and
would
that
he
were
alive
to
have
greeted
thee
as
i
do
it
is
of
no
use
regretting
the
dead
now
mother
what
i
did
i
am
glad
of
yet
i
could
not
have
done
otherwise
though
i
thought
of
thee
mother
when
i
cast
myself
into
the
raging
waters
thou
wouldst
have
mourned
if
allah
had
not
rescued
me
and
her
but
tell
me
he
continued
to
avert
the
old
lady
s
exclamations
at
the
very
thought
of
his
death
tell
me
by
your
soul
who
is
she
she
is
fair
as
a
peri
fair
as
a
houri
of
the
blessed
paradise
tell
me
if
thou
knowest
whether
she
is
his
wife
his
daughter
thou
wouldst
say
my
ay
why
not
i
understand
thy
thoughts
but
they
must
pass
away
from
thee
she
is
no
daughter
of
his
she
hath
but
newly
used
the
missee
she
must
be
his
wife
hast
thou
not
asked
the
servants
footnote
a
powder
which
women
apply
to
their
teeth
only
after
marriage
i
have
not
mother
but
art
thou
sure
of
this
i
then
a
bright
vision
has
faded
from
my
eyes
said
kasim
despondingly
the
brightest
vision
i
have
yet
seen
in
my
young
life
it
seemed
to
be
the
will
of
allah
that
she
should
be
mine
for
she
had
been
lost
to
the
world
and
to
him
only
that
i
saved
her
forbid
such
thoughts
said
his
mother
quietly
for
she
knew
the
fiery
yet
gentle
spirit
of
the
young
man
and
how
easily
she
might
offend
where
she
only
intended
kindness
she
can
be
nothing
to
thee
her
fate
is
with
mine
mother
from
the
moment
i
was
impelled
to
rescue
her
from
the
waters
i
felt
that
my
life
was
connected
with
hers
i
knew
not
as
she
lay
on
the
that
she
was
beautiful
or
young
and
i
could
not
have
hesitated
had
there
been
a
thousand
devils
in
my
path
or
the
raging
waters
of
the
alas
my
son
she
replied
these
are
but
the
fantasies
of
a
young
spirit
it
was
thy
generous
nature
believe
me
which
impelled
thee
to
rescue
her
not
thy
but
the
young
man
only
sighed
and
after
awhile
finding
that
her
words
had
but
little
power
to
remove
the
feelings
which
the
events
of
the
night
had
excited
she
blessed
him
and
retired
to
her
repose
left
to
himself
kasim
in
vain
tried
to
court
sleep
to
his
eyelids
do
what
he
would
think
of
what
he
would
lie
how
he
would
scene
of
the
khan
s
advance
across
the
flood
waters
hurrying
by
rough
eddies
caused
by
the
resistance
to
it
made
by
the
bearers
upon
which
the
light
of
the
torches
rested
and
flashed
excited
cries
which
rung
in
his
ears
every
step
which
seemed
before
his
eyes
the
last
when
all
fell
then
that
one
wild
shriek
again
the
despairing
shout
of
the
khan
and
the
eager
assistance
rendered
to
him
when
he
cast
himself
into
the
river
hurried
search
for
the
body
and
the
exertions
of
the
bearers
to
raise
the
palankeen
in
hopes
that
it
might
be
in
it
despair
when
it
was
not
renewed
search
for
some
moments
unsuccessful
the
glimpse
of
her
lying
on
the
bank
and
his
own
efforts
were
vivid
so
vivid
that
he
seemed
to
enact
over
again
the
part
he
had
performed
and
again
to
bear
the
lifeless
yet
warm
and
beautiful
body
to
his
home
with
desperate
speed
i
saw
she
was
beautiful
o
how
beautiful
he
said
i
felt
how
exquisite
her
form
i
saw
her
youthful
countenance
fifteen
can
she
be
she
the
bride
of
that
old
man
monstrous
but
it
is
my
destiny
who
can
overcome
that
prince
and
noble
the
beggar
and
the
proud
all
have
their
destiny
this
will
be
mine
and
i
must
follow
it
ya
alla
that
it
may
be
a
kind
one
he
lay
long
musing
thus
at
last
there
was
a
noise
as
though
of
talking
in
his
mother
s
apartment
he
heard
a
strange
must
be
the
lady
s
he
arose
crept
gently
to
the
door
of
the
room
and
listened
he
was
right
her
pure
and
silvery
tones
came
upon
his
ears
like
music
he
drank
in
every
word
with
eagerness
hardly
breathed
lest
he
should
lose
a
sound
he
heard
her
tell
her
little
history
how
she
had
been
sought
in
marriage
by
many
since
he
to
whom
she
was
betrothed
in
childhood
had
died
how
her
parents
had
refused
her
to
many
until
the
khan
whose
family
were
neighbours
and
who
had
returned
from
mysore
a
man
of
wealth
and
rank
hearing
of
her
beauty
had
sought
her
in
marriage
then
she
related
how
grandly
it
had
been
celebrated
how
much
money
he
had
spent
what
processions
there
had
been
through
the
noble
city
of
hyderabad
what
rich
clothes
and
jewels
he
had
given
her
and
how
he
was
now
taking
her
with
him
to
his
new
country
where
he
was
a
soldier
of
rank
and
served
the
great
tippoo
all
this
she
described
very
vividly
and
with
the
lightheartedness
and
vivacity
of
girlhood
but
at
the
end
of
all
she
sighed
for
all
the
rank
and
pomp
she
is
unhappy
thought
kasim
then
he
heard
his
mother
say
but
thou
sighest
khanum
and
yet
hast
all
that
ever
thy
most
sanguine
fancy
could
have
wished
ay
mother
was
the
reply
i
sigh
sometimes
i
have
left
my
home
my
mother
sisters
father
and
many
friends
and
i
go
whither
i
know
no
one
not
one
i
have
new
friends
to
make
new
thoughts
to
entertain
new
countries
to
see
and
can
you
wonder
that
i
should
sigh
for
the
past
or
indeed
for
the
future
alla
bless
thee
said
the
old
lady
and
kasim
heard
that
she
had
blessed
her
and
had
taken
the
evil
from
her
by
passing
her
hands
over
her
head
and
cracking
the
joints
of
her
fingers
against
her
own
temples
thou
wilt
be
happy
continued
his
mother
thou
art
for
thine
own
peace
art
very
very
beautiful
and
thy
lord
will
love
thee
thou
wilt
have
may
alla
grant
many
to
thee
children
of
beauty
like
unto
thine
own
and
therefore
do
not
sigh
but
think
thou
hast
a
bright
destiny
which
indeed
is
evident
thy
lord
is
young
and
loves
thee
i
am
assured
of
for
i
have
spoken
with
with
him
mother
ay
with
him
he
came
a
little
while
ago
to
the
screen
to
ask
after
thee
and
spoke
tenderly
young
wealthy
and
a
soldier
too
ah
thou
art
fortunate
my
but
he
is
not
young
mother
she
said
artlessly
kasim
was
sure
there
was
regret
in
the
tone
why
then
well
said
the
old
lady
thou
wilt
look
up
to
him
with
reverence
and
as
every
woman
should
do
to
her
lord
but
enough
now
thou
hast
eaten
so
now
sleep
again
may
alla
give
thee
sweet
rest
and
a
fortunate
waking
kasim
heard
no
more
though
he
listened
his
mother
busied
herself
in
arranging
her
carpet
and
then
all
was
still
he
thought
for
awhile
and
his
spirit
was
not
easy
within
him
he
arose
passed
through
the
outer
chamber
where
the
khan
still
slept
and
his
servants
around
him
and
opening
the
door
very
gently
passed
on
into
the
open
air
chapter
iii
it
was
now
midnight
and
the
storm
had
passed
away
in
the
bright
heavens
studded
with
stars
through
which
the
glorious
moon
glided
almost
obliterating
them
by
her
lustre
there
existed
no
sign
of
the
tempest
by
which
it
had
so
lately
been
overcast
the
violent
wind
had
completely
lulled
if
indeed
we
except
the
gentlest
breath
which
was
hardly
enough
to
stir
lazily
here
and
there
the
leaves
of
an
enormous
that
occupied
an
open
space
in
front
of
the
patél
s
house
and
which
also
appeared
sleeping
in
the
soft
light
while
on
every
wet
leaf
the
rays
of
the
moon
rested
causing
them
to
glisten
like
silver
against
the
sky
the
tree
cast
a
still
shadow
beyond
partly
underneath
which
the
servants
of
the
khan
and
the
bearers
of
the
palankeen
all
lay
confusedly
many
inanimate
forms
wrapped
in
their
white
sheets
and
reposing
upon
such
straw
or
other
material
as
they
had
been
able
to
collect
to
protect
them
from
the
damp
ground
in
the
broad
light
the
camels
of
the
khan
were
sitting
in
a
circle
around
a
heap
of
fodder
into
which
every
now
and
then
they
thrust
their
noses
selecting
such
morsels
as
they
chose
from
the
heap
while
the
tiny
bell
which
hung
around
the
neck
of
each
tinkled
gently
scarcely
disturbing
the
stillness
which
reigned
around
beyond
the
moonlight
rested
upon
the
white
dome
and
minarets
of
the
small
village
mosque
which
appeared
above
the
roofs
of
the
houses
and
the
hindoo
temple
also
caught
a
share
of
her
beams
revealing
its
curious
pyramidical
form
at
some
distance
among
a
small
grove
of
acacia
trees
far
away
in
the
east
the
cloud
which
had
passed
over
still
showed
itself
top
glistening
brightly
against
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
while
from
it
issued
frequent
flickerings
of
lightning
which
played
about
it
for
an
instant
and
disappeared
and
a
low
and
very
distinct
muttering
of
thunder
succeeded
showing
that
the
tempest
was
still
proceeding
on
its
threatening
yet
fertilising
course
the
cloud
and
the
distance
all
seemed
in
one
for
the
light
of
the
moon
did
not
appear
to
illuminate
much
beyond
kasim
s
immediate
vicinity
he
stood
for
a
moment
and
gazed
around
and
into
the
sky
at
the
glorious
orb
she
looked
so
mild
so
peaceful
riding
in
silence
whilst
all
around
was
so
mellowed
and
softened
by
the
blessed
light
that
in
spite
of
his
habitual
indifference
to
such
indifference
common
to
all
his
could
not
help
feeling
that
his
heart
was
softened
too
the
natives
of
india
are
perhaps
heedless
of
natural
beauties
but
if
there
be
any
to
which
they
are
not
indifferent
it
is
those
of
the
glorious
moonlights
which
are
seen
in
the
east
so
unlike
those
of
any
other
country
there
at
almost
every
season
but
particularly
in
the
warmest
it
is
impossible
for
nature
to
supply
anything
more
worthy
of
exquisite
enjoyment
than
the
moonlight
nights
there
is
something
so
soft
so
dreamy
in
the
bright
but
silvery
light
so
refreshing
from
the
intense
glare
of
the
sun
during
the
day
inviting
to
quiet
contemplation
or
to
the
enjoyment
of
society
with
whomsoever
it
may
chance
to
be
it
is
no
wonder
if
the
majority
of
asiatics
both
mahomedans
and
hindoos
should
love
it
beyond
the
day
or
appreciate
more
keenly
the
beauties
it
reveals
there
too
moonlight
in
those
seasons
has
no
drawbacks
no
dangers
there
are
no
dews
to
harm
nor
cold
to
chill
and
if
there
be
a
time
when
one
can
enjoy
warmth
without
oppression
light
without
glare
and
both
in
moderation
it
is
at
the
time
of
full
moon
in
most
months
of
the
year
in
india
after
regarding
with
some
feelings
of
envy
perhaps
the
sleeping
groups
kasim
sauntered
leisurely
towards
the
river
s
bank
his
limbs
mechanically
obeying
the
action
of
his
thoughts
the
stream
was
still
swollen
and
muddy
but
it
had
subsided
greatly
and
the
bank
upon
which
the
lady
had
been
thrown
was
now
no
longer
an
island
kasim
walked
there
it
was
here
he
said
that
she
lay
another
moment
perhaps
and
she
would
have
been
swept
away
into
eternity
i
should
have
felt
for
the
khan
but
i
should
have
been
more
at
rest
in
my
heart
than
i
am
kasim
ali
or
meer
kasim
ali
as
he
was
also
called
for
he
was
a
syud
was
the
only
son
of
the
patél
indeed
the
only
child
for
his
sisters
had
died
while
they
were
very
young
his
father
was
of
an
old
and
highly
respectable
family
of
long
descent
which
had
won
renown
under
the
mahomedan
sovereigns
of
bejapoor
in
their
wars
with
the
infidels
of
the
carnatic
and
had
been
rewarded
for
their
services
by
the
hereditary
patélship
or
chief
magistracy
and
possession
of
one
or
two
villages
with
a
certain
percentage
upon
the
collections
of
the
district
in
which
they
were
situated
they
had
also
been
presented
with
some
grants
of
land
to
a
considerable
extent
and
the
family
had
been
of
importance
and
wealth
far
superior
to
what
it
was
at
the
period
of
our
history
the
troublous
times
between
the
end
of
the
bejapoor
dynasty
and
the
subsequent
struggles
of
the
mahratta
powers
the
nizam
and
hyder
ali
for
the
districts
in
which
their
possessions
lay
had
alienated
many
of
them
and
caused
them
to
pass
into
other
and
stronger
hands
the
family
however
was
still
respectable
and
held
a
good
rank
among
those
of
the
surrounding
country
syud
the
father
of
kasim
was
much
respected
and
had
at
one
time
served
under
the
banner
of
nizam
ali
in
his
wars
against
the
mahratta
powers
and
had
been
instrumental
in
guarding
the
frontiers
of
his
kingdom
against
their
incursions
but
his
death
which
had
occurred
some
years
before
the
time
of
which
we
were
speaking
had
still
more
reduced
the
consequence
of
the
family
and
his
widow
and
only
son
could
not
be
expected
to
retain
that
influence
which
had
resulted
partly
from
the
station
and
partly
from
the
unexceptionable
conduct
of
the
old
patél
still
there
were
many
who
looked
forward
to
the
rapid
rise
of
the
young
man
and
to
the
hope
that
he
would
in
those
stirring
times
speedily
retrieve
the
fortunes
of
the
house
on
the
one
hand
were
the
mahrattas
restless
greedy
of
conquest
among
whom
a
man
who
had
any
address
and
could
collect
a
few
horsemen
together
was
one
day
an
adventurer
whom
no
one
knew
a
leader
and
commander
of
five
hundred
horse
on
the
other
was
the
nizam
whose
armies
and
were
generally
worsted
in
all
engagements
but
who
still
struggled
on
against
his
enemies
and
in
whose
service
titles
were
readily
to
be
won
sometimes
but
rarely
accompanied
by
more
substantial
benefits
again
in
the
south
the
magnificent
power
of
hyder
ali
had
sprung
out
of
the
ancient
and
dilapidated
kingdom
of
mysore
and
bid
fair
under
his
successor
tippoo
to
equal
or
to
surpass
the
others
as
kasim
ali
grew
to
manhood
his
noble
appearance
his
great
strength
skill
in
all
martial
exercises
and
accomplishments
his
respectable
acquirements
as
a
persian
scholar
and
his
known
bravery
he
had
distinguished
himself
greatly
in
several
encounters
with
the
marauders
and
thieves
of
the
district
caused
a
good
deal
of
speculation
among
the
families
of
the
country
as
to
whose
side
he
would
espouse
of
the
three
powers
we
have
mentioned
nor
was
he
in
any
haste
to
quit
his
village
naturally
of
a
quiet
contemplative
turn
of
mind
fond
of
reading
and
study
he
had
gradually
filled
his
imagination
with
romantic
tales
which
while
they
assisted
to
develop
his
susceptible
temperament
also
induced
a
superstitious
reliance
upon
destiny
in
which
he
even
exceeded
the
prevailing
belief
of
his
sect
his
mother
who
read
his
feelings
had
repeatedly
besought
him
to
allow
her
to
negotiate
for
the
hand
of
many
of
the
daughters
of
families
of
his
own
rank
in
the
neighbourhood
and
even
extended
her
inquiries
to
those
of
the
many
partly
decayed
noble
families
of
adoni
but
no
one
that
she
could
hear
of
however
beautiful
by
description
or
high
by
birth
or
lineage
had
any
charms
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
kasim
who
always
declared
he
chose
to
remain
free
and
unshackled
to
make
his
choice
wherever
his
destiny
should
as
he
said
guide
him
it
is
not
wonderful
then
that
upon
one
thus
mentally
constituted
and
whose
imagination
waited
as
it
were
an
exciting
cause
the
events
of
the
night
should
have
had
effects
such
as
have
been
noted
we
have
digressed
ay
thought
kasim
her
beauty
is
wondrous
as
i
saw
it
here
by
the
light
of
the
torches
as
i
wrung
the
wet
from
her
long
silky
hair
and
when
lifeless
as
she
appeared
i
laid
her
down
by
my
mother
was
very
wondrous
what
then
to
see
her
eyes
lips
hear
her
see
her
breathe
to
see
her
move
and
what
to
sit
with
her
beneath
the
light
of
a
moon
like
this
and
to
know
that
she
could
only
live
for
and
love
but
one
to
lie
beside
her
on
some
shady
hear
no
sound
but
her
drink
in
her
words
like
the
waters
of
the
blessed
well
of
worship
her
on
the
very
knees
of
my
heart
this
cried
the
enthusiast
this
would
be
heaven
before
its
time
one
of
the
seventy
houris
whom
the
prophet
may
his
name
be
honoured
has
promised
to
the
lot
of
every
true
believer
who
doeth
his
law
but
i
have
no
what
if
the
khan
be
old
he
is
yet
her
lord
her
lawful
lord
and
shall
the
son
of
that
light
of
the
faith
and
brave
among
the
brave
shall
he
disgrace
his
name
by
treachery
to
him
upon
whom
he
hath
exercised
hospitality
no
by
alla
no
cried
the
young
man
aloud
i
will
not
better
that
i
should
perish
than
hold
such
thoughts
but
alla
help
me
i
am
weak
and
thus
arguing
with
himself
exerting
the
better
principle
which
ever
had
been
strong
within
him
kasim
returned
to
the
house
entered
it
as
gently
as
he
had
quitted
it
and
unknown
to
any
one
reached
his
chamber
there
soothed
by
his
ramble
in
the
calm
air
and
the
tone
of
his
later
reflections
he
sank
at
last
into
slumber
but
his
dreams
were
disturbed
as
often
follows
exciting
causes
and
visions
now
happy
now
perplexing
of
the
fair
inmate
of
his
house
flitted
across
his
mind
while
he
slept
they
were
indefinite
shadows
perhaps
but
he
did
not
wake
so
calmly
in
the
morning
as
he
had
gone
to
rest
and
his
heart
was
neither
so
light
nor
his
spirit
so
free
of
care
as
before
nevertheless
he
repeated
the
morning
prayer
with
fervour
and
commended
himself
to
the
blessed
alla
to
work
out
his
destiny
as
best
he
pleased
it
was
late
ere
the
khan
rose
for
fatigue
had
oppressed
him
and
he
had
slept
heavily
it
was
reported
to
his
anxious
inquiries
that
the
lady
had
arisen
bathed
and
was
well
nor
could
the
khan
s
impatience
to
behold
once
more
one
who
was
really
dear
to
him
be
longer
delayed
the
apartment
where
his
wife
rested
was
made
private
and
in
a
few
moments
he
was
in
her
presence
how
thankful
was
he
to
see
her
with
hardly
a
trace
of
any
suffering
upon
her
her
eyes
were
as
bright
her
smile
as
sunny
and
beautiful
as
they
had
ever
been
her
hair
which
she
had
washed
in
the
bath
and
which
was
not
yet
dry
hung
over
her
shoulders
and
back
in
luxuriant
masses
and
if
its
quantity
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
disposed
accidentally
about
her
face
caused
her
fair
skin
to
seem
paler
than
usual
it
only
heightened
the
interest
her
appearance
excited
alla
bless
thee
said
the
khan
much
moved
as
he
seated
himself
by
her
she
had
risen
upon
his
entrance
alla
bless
thee
it
is
more
to
abdool
rhyman
to
see
thee
thus
than
to
have
the
empire
of
hind
at
his
feet
and
thou
art
well
well
indeed
my
lord
to
him
who
protected
me
in
the
tempest
she
said
looking
up
devoutly
and
thanks
to
her
who
since
i
was
brought
hither
has
not
ceased
to
tend
me
as
a
ay
fairest
said
her
lord
what
do
we
not
owe
to
the
inmates
of
this
house
and
indeed
to
all
this
village
without
their
aid
we
had
been
i
have
an
indistinct
remembrance
of
some
danger
said
the
lady
i
think
i
recollect
the
palankeen
entering
the
waters
and
their
frightful
appearance
and
that
i
shut
my
eyes
and
i
think
too
she
added
after
a
pause
and
passing
her
hand
across
her
eyes
that
it
seemed
to
slip
and
i
shrieked
and
then
i
knew
nothing
of
what
followed
till
i
awoke
all
wet
and
the
women
were
rubbing
me
and
taking
my
clothes
off
and
then
i
remember
waking
again
and
speaking
to
the
kind
lady
who
had
so
watched
me
and
i
think
i
asked
her
how
i
had
been
brought
here
but
she
made
light
of
it
would
not
let
me
speak
much
and
so
i
went
to
sleep
again
for
i
was
weary
they
said
too
thou
wert
well
she
continued
after
a
pause
something
tells
me
that
all
was
not
right
that
there
was
danger
but
my
memory
is
very
no
wonder
my
pearl
my
rose
cried
the
khan
and
how
i
bless
that
good
lady
for
keeping
the
truth
from
thee
as
thou
wert
then
the
remembrance
of
it
might
have
been
fatal
and
so
thou
dost
not
know
that
thou
wert
nearly
lost
to
me
for
ever
i
had
seen
thee
plunged
beneath
that
roaring
flood
and
little
hoped
ever
to
have
been
greeted
by
that
sweet
smile
again
alas
no
said
the
lady
shuddering
and
was
i
indeed
in
such
peril
who
then
saved
me
was
thou
surely
my
noble
lord
and
i
have
been
hitherto
unmindful
of
it
she
cried
bowing
her
head
to
his
feet
how
insensible
must
thou
not
have
thought
me
not
so
beloved
not
so
was
the
eager
reply
of
the
khan
as
he
raised
her
up
i
had
not
that
happiness
i
cast
myself
it
is
true
into
the
waters
after
thee
when
the
bearers
fell
but
it
was
useless
i
should
have
been
lost
encumbered
as
i
was
with
my
arms
only
for
the
bearers
who
saved
me
no
even
as
alla
sends
visitations
of
evil
so
does
he
most
frequently
in
his
wisdom
find
a
path
of
extrication
from
them
there
was
a
noble
fellow
a
very
roostum
and
by
alla
a
mejnoon
in
countenance
saw
the
accident
his
quick
eye
saw
thy
lifeless
form
cast
up
by
the
boiling
water
and
he
rescued
thee
at
the
peril
of
his
own
life
valuable
one
too
fairest
for
he
is
the
son
of
a
widow
the
only
son
and
the
head
of
the
family
a
word
the
son
of
her
who
has
tended
thee
so
holy
prophet
exclaimed
the
lady
was
i
in
this
peril
and
so
rescued
at
the
peril
of
his
own
life
too
he
a
widow
s
son
thou
saidst
what
if
he
had
been
lost
and
she
fell
to
musing
silently
gradually
however
for
the
khan
did
not
hazard
a
reply
her
bosom
heaved
a
tear
welled
over
one
of
her
eyelids
and
fell
upon
her
hand
unnoticed
and
another
the
khan
let
them
have
their
course
they
will
soothe
her
better
than
my
words
he
thought
and
thought
truly
after
awhile
she
spoke
again
it
was
abruptly
and
showed
her
thoughts
had
been
with
her
deliverer
thou
wilt
reward
him
noble
khan
she
said
mine
is
but
a
poor
life
tis
true
but
of
some
worth
in
thy
sight
i
know
of
much
in
that
of
those
i
have
left
behind
my
mother
it
would
have
been
a
sore
blow
to
thee
to
have
heard
of
thy
rose
s
death
so
soon
after
reward
him
ameena
cried
the
khan
ay
with
half
my
wealth
would
he
take
it
but
he
is
of
proud
blood
and
a
long
ancestry
though
he
is
but
a
patél
and
such
an
offer
would
be
an
insult
art
and
speak
thy
thought
he
would
not
take
money
thou
saidst
no
no
dare
not
offer
jewels
perhaps
for
his
mother
may
have
all
mine
thou
knowest
there
are
some
of
he
would
set
no
value
upon
them
to
him
they
are
of
no
use
for
he
is
not
not
married
and
so
beautiful
she
said
musing
aloud
nor
to
his
mother
continued
the
khan
who
had
not
heard
her
exclamation
she
is
an
old
woman
no
jewels
would
not
do
though
they
are
better
than
horses
arms
might
gratify
him
if
he
is
a
ay
that
is
better
for
he
is
a
soldier
from
head
to
heel
but
of
what
use
would
they
be
to
him
without
service
in
which
to
exercise
them
here
there
are
no
enemies
but
plunderers
now
and
then
have
it
now
he
continued
joyfully
after
a
pause
service
ay
that
is
his
best
reward
that
i
can
help
him
by
the
prophet
i
was
a
fool
not
to
have
thought
of
this
sooner
he
will
be
a
rare
addition
to
tippoo
s
pagha
i
am
much
mistaken
too
in
a
few
months
if
he
have
an
opportunity
and
by
the
blessing
of
the
prophet
it
is
seldom
wanting
against
either
the
english
or
hindoo
kafirs
if
he
do
not
win
himself
not
only
renown
but
a
command
perhaps
like
my
own
tippoo
sultaun
is
no
respecter
of
ay
my
noble
lord
such
an
offer
would
be
worthy
of
thy
generosity
and
his
acceptance
was
the
lady
s
reply
and
he
could
easily
follow
us
to
the
and
why
not
accompany
us
i
for
one
should
be
glad
of
his
society
for
he
is
a
scholar
as
well
as
a
soldier
and
that
is
more
than
i
am
besides
one
of
my
men
fell
last
night
and
his
place
is
fell
was
drowned
she
exclaimed
no
my
pearl
his
hour
was
come
he
fell
by
the
hand
of
alla
struck
by
ay
it
was
very
fearful
she
said
shuddering
i
remember
that
fell
didst
thou
say
alas
it
was
he
that
twice
saved
thy
it
was
but
this
was
his
destiny
thou
knowest
it
had
been
written
and
who
could
have
averted
it
what
sayest
thou
shall
i
offer
the
patél
the
not
ibrahim
s
since
thou
askest
me
she
said
as
he
is
of
gentle
blood
ask
him
to
accompany
thee
or
say
come
to
abdool
rhyman
at
seringapatam
the
leader
of
a
thousand
horse
thou
wilt
say
thou
wilt
give
him
service
in
thine
own
risala
and
hear
his
well
spoken
my
rose
said
the
blunt
soldier
verily
i
owe
him
the
price
of
thy
glorious
beauty
and
thy
love
both
of
which
were
lost
to
me
but
for
him
for
ever
so
alla
keep
thee
i
will
not
disturb
thee
again
till
evening
and
advise
thee
to
rest
thyself
from
all
thy
many
fatigues
and
hafiz
a
very
roostum
a
mejnoon
in
countenance
thought
the
fair
creature
as
shutting
her
eyes
she
threw
herself
back
against
the
pillows
a
noble
fellow
my
lord
called
him
and
a
scholar
many
perfections
a
widow
s
son
dear
to
her
he
must
be
will
not
part
with
again
there
was
another
train
of
thought
he
must
have
seen
my
face
prophet
i
was
not
able
to
conceal
that
he
carried
me
too
in
his
arms
and
i
was
insensible
what
if
my
dress
was
disordered
and
she
blushed
unconsciously
and
drew
it
instinctively
around
her
and
he
must
have
seen
me
too
in
the
broad
light
when
he
entered
this
room
what
could
he
have
thought
of
me
they
say
i
am
and
a
look
she
unthinkingly
cast
upon
a
small
mirror
which
set
in
a
ring
she
wore
upon
her
thumb
appeared
to
confirm
the
thought
for
a
gentle
smile
passed
over
her
countenance
for
an
instant
what
could
he
have
thought
of
me
she
added
but
her
speculations
as
to
his
thoughts
by
some
unaccountable
means
to
her
appeared
to
disturb
her
own
and
after
much
unsatisfactory
reasoning
she
fell
into
a
half
dose
a
dreamy
state
when
the
scenes
of
the
night
her
own
rescue
flitted
before
her
fancy
and
perhaps
it
is
not
strange
that
in
them
a
figure
which
she
believed
to
be
a
likeness
of
the
young
patél
occupied
a
prominent
and
not
a
disagreeable
situation

driven
by

kept
up
an
incessant
bleating
far
in

the
sun
had
set
in
brilliancy
and
a
few
light
and
exquisitely
tinted
clouds
floated
away
towards
the
rocky
range
of
the
adoni
fortress
whose
rugged
outlines
could
be
seen
sharply
defined
against
the
sky
there
were
many
beauties
there
but
they
only
remained

living
the

the
long
narrow
mound
raised
on
the
top

by

who
had
attended

funeral
turned
away
and
retired

khan
and

anxious
to
pay
the
last
marks
of
respect
to
the
deceased
stayed

had
been
smoothed
down

having
partaken
of
the
hearty
meal
supplied
by
the
patél
and
most
exquisitely
cooked
by
the
stout
functionary
we
have
before
alluded
to
and
having
each
been
supplied
with
that
soother
of
many
mortal
ills
a
good
hooka
had
already
almost
forgotten
the
ceremony
they
had
assisted
in
and
were
well
disposed
to
become
excellent
friends
and
to
detail
to
each
other
passages
in
their
lives
which
they
would
for
ever
have
remained
ignorant
of
but
for
the
fortuitous
circumstances
in
which
they
had
been
placed
and
it
was
after
a
recital
of
his
own
deeds
which
however
modestly
given
could
not
fail
of
having
impressed
kasim
with
a
high
sense
of
his
gallant
conduct
that
the
khan
said
my
brother
i
was
an
adventurer
as
you
might
be
young
and
active
hairbrained
perhaps
and
ready
for
any
exciting
employment
with
only
my
arms
and
an
indifferent
horse
i
entered
the
service
of
hyder
ali
you
see
me
now
the
commander
of
a
thousand
horse
having
won
a
reputation
at
the
sword
s
point
second
to
none
in
his
gallant
army
why
shouldst
thou
not
have
the
same
fate
who
hast
personal
attractions
greater
power
and
scholarship
to
aid
of
infinite
value
to
an
adventurer
what
sayest
thou
then
wilt
thou
serve
him
whom
i
serve
the
lion
of
war
the
upholder
of
the
faith
speak
o
patél
for
i
love
thee
and
can
help
thee
in
this
my
lord
draws
a
bright
picture
to
dazzle
mine
understanding
he
answered
i
have
dreamed
of
such
things
of
attaining
to
giddy
eminences
even
of
rank
and
power
but
they
are
no
more
i
well
know
than
the
false
visions
of
youth
the
brighter
and
more
alluring
as
they
are
the
more
deceptive
and
by
my
beard
by
your
salt
i
say
no
cried
the
khan
i
have
said
nothing
but
what
is
a
matter
of
occurrence
in
the
army
what
was
hyder
s
origin
infinitely
lower
than
thine
own
thy
ancestry
was
noble
can
be
traced
back
a
few
generations
beginning
with
a
punjabee
fakeer
and
descending
not
much
improved
i
faith
to
his
father
hyder
whose
mother
was
only
the
daughter
of
a
of
allund
somewhere
by
koolburgah
it
is
destiny
young
man
destiny
which
will
guide
on
thy
high
and
broad
forehead
shines
as
brightly
as
if
thy
future
history
were
already
written
there
in
letters
of
gold
my
lord
s
words
are
enticing
very
enticing
said
the
youth
and
ever
have
i
felt
that
the
inactive
life
i
am
leading
was
a
shame
on
me
in
these
times
but
i
like
not
the
service
of
the
nizam
and
the
mahrattas
are
infidels
i
would
not
shame
my
faith
by
consorting
with
bravely
spoken
hadst
thou
come
to
tippoo
sultaun
mounted
and
armed
as
thou
shouldst
be
alone
and
unbefriended
as
i
did
to
his
father
would
have
enrolled
thee
upon
handsome
pay
at
once
in
his
own
pagha
with
me
thou
wilt
have
the
benefit
of
a
friend
and
i
swear
to
thee
upon
this
my
beard
and
thy
salt
cried
the
khan
generously
i
will
be
a
friend
and
a
brother
to
thee
even
as
thou
hast
been
one
to
me
and
her
who
is
as
dear
to
me
as
my
own
life
s
blood
i
owe
this
to
thee
for
her
life
the
risk
of
thine
own
when
we
were
nothing
to
thee
by
alla
but
as
the
dust
of
the
earth
owe
it
for
thine
hospitality
i
desire
thee
for
a
companion
and
a
friend
and
above
all
my
spirit
is
vexed
to
see
one
like
thee
hiding
here
in
his
village
and
marring
his
own
destiny
by
sloth
and
inaction
dost
thou
think
that
service
will
come
to
seek
thee
if
thou
dost
not
seek
it
footnote
household
troops
the
young
man
felt
the
address
of
the
rough
but
kind
soldier
deeply
but
he
still
hesitated
the
khan
tried
to
guess
his
thoughts
dost
thou
think
he
said
that
i
have
sweet
words
at
my
command
wherewith
to
entice
thee
ay
that
is
my
mistake
and
i
have
spoken
too
freely
to
one
who
has
never
yet
known
contradiction
nor
received
not
so
not
so
noble
khan
almost
my
father
cried
kasim
i
beseech
thee
not
to
think
me
thus
haughty
or
impatient
by
your
beard
i
am
thought
but
of
my
the
suddenness
of
my
poverty
perhaps
said
the
khan
do
not
be
ashamed
to
own
it
thou
wouldst
go
to
service
as
a
cavalier
as
thou
art
gallantly
armed
and
mounted
it
not
so
it
is
i
would
not
serve
on
foot
nor
have
i
money
to
buy
a
horse
such
as
i
would
ride
into
right
thou
art
right
by
the
prophet
but
let
not
this
trouble
thee
we
spoke
of
thee
this
morning
we
dare
not
offer
thee
be
not
dare
not
offer
thee
jewels
else
both
were
thine
we
could
offer
thee
honourable
service
and
if
thou
wilt
accept
it
as
my
brother
thou
art
entitled
to
look
to
me
thine
elder
thou
knowest
for
such
matters
as
thou
needest
with
me
are
two
horses
the
best
of
the
dekhan
blood
beside
mine
own
motee
him
thou
canst
not
have
but
either
of
the
others
or
both
are
thine
and
if
they
do
not
suit
thee
there
are
others
at
the
city
where
thou
shalt
be
free
to
choose
see
i
have
conquered
all
thy
the
young
man
was
much
affected
and
the
khan
s
kindness
fairly
brought
the
tears
to
his
eyes
such
service
as
i
can
do
thee
o
generous
being
he
exclaimed
i
vow
here
under
mine
own
roof
and
by
the
head
of
my
mother
will
follow
thee
to
the
death
such
honourable
service
as
i
would
alone
have
ever
accepted
is
in
my
power
and
i
accept
it
with
gratitude
to
thee
and
thine
whom
the
prophet
shield
with
his
choicest
care
it
were
well
that
your
arrangements
were
quickly
concluded
for
i
can
not
wait
beyond
said
the
khan
it
will
be
ample
for
my
slender
preparations
replied
the
youth
i
will
break
this
to
my
mother
you
do
right
meer
sahib
i
honour
thee
for
thy
consideration
and
i
too
will
to
the
khanum
she
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
her
deliverer
and
her
lord
are
now
friends
and
brothers
in
kasim
sought
his
mother
she
was
with
her
guest
as
he
passed
the
door
of
the
inner
chamber
so
he
desired
a
girl
who
was
without
to
inform
his
mother
he
desired
to
speak
with
her
in
his
own
apartment
there
was
not
much
to
tell
her
and
yet
he
knew
that
it
would
grieve
the
old
lady
but
i
can
not
continue
thus
he
thought
aloud
the
fortunes
of
our
house
have
fallen
and
the
khan
s
words
bear
conviction
with
them
i
can
retrieve
them
may
perhaps
retrieve
them
i
should
rather
say
and
after
all
she
will
rejoice
to
hear
of
me
and
the
fortune
and
rank
i
shall
by
the
blessing
of
alla
speedly
win
and
but
here
his
thoughts
became
quite
inexpressible
even
to
himself
for
there
rushed
suddenly
before
his
imagination
such
a
tide
of
processions
soldiery
elephants
wars
camps
as
almost
bewildered
him
while
here
and
there
a
figure
mingled
with
all
which
had
he
been
closely
questioned
he
must
have
admitted
was
that
of
the
fair
ameena
but
his
mother
interrupted
what
we
will
say
he
was
striving
to
put
from
him
by
entering
and
standing
before
him
thou
didst
send
for
me
my
son
she
said
what
news
hast
thou
to
tell
was
the
khan
pleased
with
the
zeafut
was
the
meat
well
cooked
by
the
prophet
he
hath
a
glorious
cook
what
dishes
he
sent
into
the
khanum
of
which
we
have
been
partaking
by
thine
eyes
i
have
not
tasted
such
footnote
entertainment
but
while
the
old
lady
was
trying
to
remember
when
she
had
last
eaten
of
such
savoury
messes
as
she
spoke
of
her
son
gently
interrupted
her
and
said
gravely
as
he
rose
and
seated
her
in
his
own
place
mother
i
have
much
to
tell
thee
so
collect
thy
thoughts
and
she
was
attentive
in
a
moment
and
eagerly
looked
for
what
he
should
say
not
a
little
apprehension
perhaps
for
there
was
sadness
nay
even
a
quivering
perceptible
in
the
tone
with
which
he
spoke
her
grief
was
uncontrollable
at
first
he
gradually
unfolded
all
his
previous
determination
to
enter
service
when
he
could
with
desires
for
an
active
his
great
chances
of
speedy
advancement
under
the
patronage
of
his
friend
he
laid
them
before
his
mother
with
a
natural
eloquence
under
which
her
first
sudden
shock
of
grief
fast
yielded
kasim
saw
his
opportunity
and
continued
so
much
as
thou
lovest
me
mother
wilt
thou
not
have
pride
when
i
write
to
thee
that
i
command
men
that
i
have
fought
with
the
infidel
english
that
i
have
been
rewarded
that
i
am
honoured
wilt
thou
not
feel
and
then
say
if
i
had
prevented
him
there
would
have
been
none
of
and
doth
it
not
behove
every
believer
now
to
draw
his
sword
in
defence
of
the
faith
look
around
english
are
masters
of
bengal
and
oude
they
hold
mahamed
ali
of
the
carnatic
and
him
of
oude
in
a
base
thraldom
they
thirst
for
conquest
and
are
as
brave
as
they
are
cunning
mahrattas
have
taken
hindostan
and
the
dekhan
and
are
every
day
making
encroachments
upon
nizam
ali
s
power
which
totters
upon
an
insecure
foundation
do
not
the
eyes
of
every
true
believer
turn
to
tippoo
a
man
who
has
raised
himself
to
be
a
monarch
i
say
mother
i
believe
it
to
be
my
destiny
to
follow
his
fortunes
i
have
long
thought
so
and
have
eagerly
watched
the
time
when
i
should
be
able
to
join
him
it
has
come
and
dost
thou
love
thy
son
so
little
as
to
stand
in
the
way
of
fame
honour
wealth
everything
that
is
dear
to
me
as
a
man
and
as
thy
son
the
old
lady
could
not
reply
but
she
arose
and
cast
herself
upon
the
manly
breast
of
her
son
and
though
she
sobbed
bitterly
and
long
yet
at
last
she
told
him
in
accents
broken
by
her
emotion
she
was
convinced
that
he
was
acting
wisely
and
that
her
prayers
night
and
day
would
be
for
his
welfare
and
her
mind
once
being
reconciled
to
the
thought
of
parting
with
him
she
made
every
preparation
with
alacrity
such
few
garments
as
were
necessary
and
were
the
best
among
his
not
stock
were
put
aside
and
looked
over
and
one
or
two
showy
handkerchiefs
and
scarfs
which
she
possessed
with
deep
gold
borders
to
them
were
added
to
his
wardrobe
i
shall
not
want
them
she
said
i
am
old
and
ought
not
to
think
of
nor
did
kasim
neglect
his
own
affairs
having
made
the
communication
to
his
mother
he
at
once
sought
the
kurnum
or
accountant
of
the
village
and
disclosed
his
intentions
to
that
worthy
functionary
though
somewhat
surprised
at
his
sudden
decision
he
did
not
wonder
at
its
being
made
and
as
he
was
a
rich
man
he
liberally
tendered
a
loan
of
money
to
enable
kasim
to
live
respectably
until
such
time
as
he
should
receive
pay
from
his
new
master
he
despatched
a
messenger
for
his
uncle
his
mother
s
brother
who
arrived
at
night
and
early
the
next
morning
he
had
concluded
every
arrangement
for
the
management
of
his
little
property
and
the
care
of
his
mother
these
matters
being
arranged
to
his
satisfaction
kasim
sought
the
khan
with
a
light
heart
and
sincere
pleasure
upon
his
countenance
he
found
him
busied
inspecting
his
horses
and
greeted
him
heartily
well
asked
the
khan
how
fared
you
with
the
lady
your
mother
after
you
left
me
well
excellently
well
was
the
reply
she
made
some
opposition
at
first
but
was
reasonable
in
the
good
then
i
have
no
blame
on
my
head
he
said
laughing
but
tell
me
when
shalt
thou
be
prepared
now
khan
sahib
even
now
am
i
ready
speak
the
word
and
i
attend
you
at
why
then
delay
kasim
bismilla
let
us
go
at
once
the
khanum
is
well
and
if
thy
good
mother
can
but
give
us
a
plain
kicheree
we
will
set
off
soon
the
day
is
cloudy
and
there
will
be
no
footnote
rice
and
pulse
boiled
together
i
will
go
bid
her
prepare
it
and
when
i
have
put
on
some
travelling
garment
better
than
this
khan
sahib
and
got
out
my
arms
as
soon
as
thou
wilt
we
may
be
in
our
saddles
i
am
already
impatient
to
see
the
the
meal
was
soon
despatched
by
master
and
camels
horses
saddled
no
one
saw
the
farewell
kasim
took
of
his
mother
but
it
was
observed
that
his
cheek
was
wet
when
he
came
out
of
his
house
accoutred
and
armed
noble
figure
indeed
and
one
which
drew
forth
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
gratification
from
the
khan
chapter
and
in
truth
accoutred
as
he
was
and
dressed
in
better
clothes
than
he
had
hitherto
worn
meer
kasim
ali
was
one
on
whom
the
eye
of
man
could
not
rest
for
a
moment
without
admiration
nor
that
of
a
woman
without
love
he
wore
a
dark
purple
silk
vest
bordered
round
the
throat
and
openings
at
the
chest
with
broad
gold
lace
and
handsome
gold
pointed
buttons
a
crimson
waistband
with
a
deep
gold
border
was
around
his
loins
in
which
were
stuck
several
daggers
of
various
forms
and
very
beautifully
chased
silver
handles
and
on
his
shoulder
was
a
broad
gold
belt
or
baldric
somewhat
tarnished
it
is
true
but
still
handsome
this
supported
a
long
sword
with
a
half
inlaid
with
gold
and
lined
with
crimson
velvet
the
scabbard
was
of
the
same
ornamented
and
protected
at
the
end
by
a
deep
and
richly
chased
ferule
at
his
back
was
a
shield
much
covered
with
gilding
and
brass
bosses
by
alla
and
the
twelve
imaums
cried
the
khan
thou
art
worthy
to
look
on
and
a
jewel
of
price
in
the
eye
of
an
old
soldier
but
there
are
the
steeds
thy
choice

called

is

a
gallant

and
perfect

call

after

who
was

is
steadier
perhaps
and
not
so
active

which
wilt

have
footnote
ruby
i
think
with
your
permission
khan
sahib
i
will
mount
yacoot
and
so
saying
he
approached
him
and
bounded
into
the
saddle
alla
what
a
seat
cried
the
khan
in
an
ecstasy
of
admiration
after
kasim
had
mounted
and
the
horse
had
made
several
wonderful
bounds
he
does
not
move
not
a
hair
even
i
should
have
been
disturbed
by
that
inshalla
he
is
a
good
horseman
enough
meer
sahib
he
cried
enough
now
yacoot
is
a
young
beast
and
a
fiery
devil
but
i
think
after
all
he
will
suit
thee
better
than
the
i
think
yacoot
and
i
shall
be
very
good
friends
when
we
know
each
other
better
said
kasim
but
see
the
khanum
waits
and
the
bearers
are
ready
put
the
palankeen
close
up
to
the
door
that
it
may
be
more
convenient
he
added
to
them
they
obeyed
and
in
a
few
moments
a
figure
enveloped
from
head
to
foot
but
whose
tinkling
anklets
were
delicious
music
in
the
ears
of
kasim
emerged
from
the
threshold
of
the
house
and
instantly
entered
the
palankeen
another
followed
and
busied
herself
for
a
few
moments
in
arranging
the
interior
of
the
vehicle
this
was
kasim
s
mother
whose
heart
almost
too
full
for
utterance
had
much
difficulty
in
mustering
words
sufficient
to
bid
her
lovely
guest
farewell
may
alla
keep
you
said
the
old
lady
blinded
by
her
tears
you
are
young
and
proud
and
beautiful
but
you
will
sometimes
think
perhaps
of
the
old
patélne
remember
all
i
have
told
you
of
my
son
and
that
as
the
khan
is
a
father
to
him
so
you
are
his
mother
have
now
the
care
of
him
not
i
may
alla
keep
thee
for
my
old
eyes
can
hardly
hope
to
see
thee
again
and
she
blessed
her
willingly

replied
all

constant
solicitude
for

welfare

will
do
and
while

remember

do
you
too

the
old
lady
had
no
reply
to
give
she
shut
the
door
of
the
palankeen
with
trembling
the
bearers
understanding
the
signal
advanced
raised
it
to
their
shoulders
and
bore
it
rapidly
forward

cried
the
khan
who
had
mounted
delay
not
not
a
few
last
words
with
my
mother
and
i
follow
she
was
standing
at
the
door
he
rode
up
to
her
and
stooped
down
from
the
horse
gently
thy
blessing
mother
again
he
thy
last
blessing
on
thy
she
gave
it
and
hastily
searching
for
a
rupee
she
drew
a
handkerchief
from
her
bosom
and
folding
it
in
it
tied
it
around
his
arm

blessing

blessing
of

may
greet
him

a
warrior
and
one
that
has
won
fame
i
thank
thee
mother
but
saidst
thou
aught
to
her
of
me
i
told
her
much
of
thee
and
of
thy
temper
from
thy
youth
up
it
appeared
to
interest
her
and
she
hath
promised
to
befriend
enough
dear
mother
remember
my
last
have
the
trees
i
planted
looked
to
and
carefully
tended
and
the
tomb
protected
inshalla
i
will
return
to
see
them
grown
up
and
again
be
reminded
of
the
spot
where
i
saved
her
and
so
saying
and
not
trusting
himself
to
speak
to
many
who
would
have
crowded
around
him
for
a
last
word
the
young
man
turned
his
horse
and
striking
his
heels
sharply
into
its
flank
the
noble
animal
bounding
forward
bore
him
away
after
his
future
companions
followed
by
the
blessings
and
dim
and
streaming
eyes
of
most
who
were
assembled
around
the
door
of
his
mother
s
home
the
old
lady
heeded
not
that
her
veil
had
dropped
from
her
face
there
was
but
one
object
which
occupied
her
vision
of
the
many
that
were
before
her
eyes
and
that
was
the
martial
figure
of
her
son
as
it
rapidly
disappeared
before
her
she
lost
sight
of
him
as
he
passed
the
gate
of
the
village
again
she
saw
him
beyond
there
was
a
slight
ascent
up
which
the
party
now
united
were
rapidly
advancing
he
reached
them
she
saw
him
exchange
greeting
with
the
khan
as
he
checked
his
bounding
steed
fall
in
by
his
side
apparently
in
familiar
converse
and
for
a
short
time
more
the
whole
were
brightly
before
her
as
a
gleam
of
sunlight
shone
forth
glancing
brightly
from
their
and
the
bosses
on
their
shields
and
upon
the
gay
colours
of
their
dresses
a
bright
omen
she
thought
it
was
of
the
future
but
they
had
now
attained
the
summit
kasim
and
the
khan
disappeared
gradually
behind
it
then
the
camels
one
by
one
were
lost
to
her
gaze
suddenly
the
place
was
void
she
shook
the
blinding
stream
from
her
eyes
and
looked
there
was
no
one
there
her
son
and
his
companions
had
passed
away
she
thought
for
ever
then
only
she
perceived
that
she
was
unveiled
and
hastily
retreating
into
her
now
lonely
and
cheerless
abode
for
the
while
gave
herself
up
to
that
violent
grief
which
she
had
been
ill
able
to
repress
as
he
left
her
ay
now
thou
lookest
like
a
gentleman
as
thou
art

miles

to

was
quietly

kasim
joyfully

eagerly

will

if

can

within

said
the
khan
to
his
retainer

properly
charged
the
palankeen
was
put
down
and
all
waited
the
issue
with
much
interest
and
anxiety
the
khan
went
to
the
palankeen
look
out
my
rose
he
said
i
have
dared
the
patél
to
shoot
a
deer
and
he
is
gone
to
do
it
look
see
how
he
creeps
onward
like
a
cat
or
a
the
lady
looked
out
it
was
very
exciting
to
her
to
see
the
motions
of
the
young
man
and
if
it
may
be
believed
she
actually
put
up
a
mental
prayer
for
his
success
ya
alla
give
him
a
steady
hand
she
said
inwardly
and
looked
the
more
he
will
be
near
them
soon
said
the
khan
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hands
there
is
a
nulla
yonder
which
will
afford
him
cover
canst
thou
see
mashalla
this
is
better
than
shooting

cried
the
lady
as
one
of
the
deer

had
been
lying
down

up
and
gazed
warily
about
they
will
be

progress
was
slow

had

up
the
pursuit

he
knew

was
observing

was
enough

stealthily

now
the

the

kasim

were

so

unfolded

recited
pieces
of

he
repeated
tales
from

himself

was

but
after

they
were
near
the

they
were

when

arrived
they
found
the

with
kasim

ready
to
receive
them
at
the
door
of
a
neat

small
mosque
which
was
in

a
few
tent
walls
were
placed
across
the
open
part
to
screen
them
from
the
weather
and
the
public
gaze
carpets
spread
and
soon
some
were
resting
themselves
while
others
wandered
into
the
bazaars
or
were
employed
in
various
offices
for
the
khan
particularly
the
cook
who
after
sending
for
a
village
butcher
to
skin
and
cut
up
the
deer
selected
some
prime
parts
of
the
meat
which
he
proceeded
to
dress
after
the
following
fashion
and
which
we
cordially
recommend
to
all
uninitiated
the
meat
was
cut
into
small
pieces
and
each
piece
covered
with
the
ingredients
for
seasoning
the
dish
which
had
been
ground
with
water
to
the
consistence
of
paste
then
some
butter
and
onions
were
put
into
a
pan
and
the
onions
fried
till
they
were
brown
into
this
was
placed
the
meat
some
salt
and
sour
curds
or
then
it
was
suffered
to
simmer
gently
while
zoolfoo
every
now
and
then
stirred
it
with
great
assiduity
when
it
was
partly
done
the
vegetables
were
added
and
in
a
short
time
most
savoury
steams
succeeded
saluting
the
hungry
noses
of
a
few
lean
and
village
dogs
these
attracted
by
the
savour
prowled
about
with
watering
chops
in
the
vicinity
of
the
fireplace
much
cursed
by
the
cook
and
frequently
pelted
with
stones
as
they
ventured
a
little
nearer
many
kites
were
wheeling
and
screaming
overhead
and
a
good
many
crows
sat
upon
the
nearest
stones
the
wall
and
other
slight
elevations
by
their
constant
chattering
and
croakings
speculating
upon
their
probable
share
may
your
mothers
and
sisters
be
destroyed
cried
the
cook
at
length
fairly
perplexed
between
the
dogs
the
kites
and
the
crows
each
of
which
watched
the
slightest
inattention
in
order
to
attempt
to
carry
off
anything
they
could
see
may
they
be
destroyed
and
dishonoured
ya
alla
he
continued
in
exclamation
as
he
saw
a
dog
coolly
seize
hold
of
and
run
away
with
part
of
the
leg
of
the
deer
ya

and
he
flung
a
stone
after
the
delinquent
which
had
happily
effect
on
his
hinder
portion
and
made
him
limp
off
on
three
legs
howling
and
without
his
booty
ha

hit
you
did
i
that
will
teach
you
to

and
he
picked
up
the
meat
but
holy
prophet
i
am
ruined
he
again
exclaimed
and
indeed
it
was
provoking
enough
to
see
several
kites
in
succession
making
stoops
at
the
little
board
upon
which
he
had
been
cutting
up
the
meat
for
the
kabob
at
every
stoop
carrying
off
large
pieces
which
holding
in
their
talons
they
fairly
ate
as
they
sailed
over
him
screaming
apparently
in
exultation
holy
prophet
that
i
should
have
eaten
such
dirt
at
the
hands
of
these
animals
ho
meer

he
continued
to
kasim
who
approached
wilt
thou
keep
watch
here
while
i
cook
the
dinner
for
if
thou
dost
not
there
will
be
none
left
one
brute
had
carried
off
this
leg
which
i
have
just
rescued
and
while
i
was
about
that
the

ate
up
the
the
syud
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
worthy
functionary
s
distress
well
as
there
is
no
one
near
zoolfoo
i
will
sit
here
and
he
seated
himself
upon
a
log
of
wood
not
far
from
him
now
we
will
see
if
any
of
these
sons
of
unchaste
mothers
will
come
near
thee

deservest
this
for
what
thou
art
doing
for
us
there
which
smelleth
it
is
a
dish
for
a
prince
meer
sahib
said
the
cook
giving
the
contents
of
the
pot
an
affectionate
stir
i
say
it
is
a
dish
for
the
huzoor
and
such
an
one
as
i
have
often
cooked
for
his
then
thou
wast
in
the
kitchen
of
nizam
ali
even
so
meer
sahib
there
is
plenty
to
eat
but
little
pay
so
i
left
the
huzoor
to
follow
the
fortunes
of
the
khan
his
prosperity
increase
ay
he
is
a
noble
fellow
zoolfoo
and
a
generous
one
what
he
hath
done
for
me
thou
didst
enough
for
him
said
the
cook
drily
knowest
thou
that
the
khanum
is
a
bride
and
that
she
is
only
fourteen
or
fifteen
and
as
beautiful
as
the
moon
at
the
full
is
she
said
kasim
carelessly
is
she
retorted
the
cook
i
saw
her
three
months
ago
for
she
was
a
neighbour
of
mine
i
have
known
her
for
years
but
that
she
does
not
indeed
that
is
very
extraordinary
said
kasim
absently
not
at
all
replied
the
cook
my
sister
was
servant
in
their
house
for
some
years
is
there
still
she
told
me
all
about
this
marriage
it
was
very
indeed
kasim
again
ay
truly
and
the
maiden
was
very
loth
to
be
married
to
one
so
old
but
she
was
of
age
to
be
married
and
her
parents
did
not
like
to
refuse
when
such
a
man
as
abdool
rhyman
offered
for
they
call
him
but
he
was
only
the
son
of
a
soldier
of
the
huzoor
a
poor
man
they
nasur
told
he
has
two
other
wives
at
seringapatam
but
he
has
no
that
is
very
odd
said
kasim
very
returned
the
cook
but
their
conversation
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
one
of
the
men
who
approached
and
relieved
kasim
of
his
watch
chapter
vi
they
rested
in
the
town
of
bellary
the
next
day
and
as
there
was
an
alarm
of
parties
of
mahratta
horse
being
abroad
though
they
could
hear
of
no
one
having
suffered
from
them
the
khan
on
account
of
the
baggage
he
had
with
him
determined
on
travelling
the
eastern
road
by
nundidroog
from
thence
he
could
reach
the
city
either
by
bangalore
or
the
western
road
as
best
suited
him
but
no
enemy
appeared
though
several
alarms
were
given
by
the
people
at
one
place
however
after
some
days
travel
they
heard
that
a
party
of
horse
had
passed
the
day
before
and
at
the
stage
after
they
kept
a
watch
all
night
some
need
in
fact
for
a
marauding
party
of
great
strength
were
undoubtedly
in
their
vicinity
as
was
plainly
to
be
seen
by
the
conflagration
of
a
small
village
at
some
coss
distant
which
could
easily
be
distinguished
from
the
town
wherein
they
rested
for
the
night
this
looks
like
danger
said
the
khan
as
from
the
tower
in
the
middle
of
the
village
he
and
kasim
looked
forth
over
the
wide
plain
the
rascals
yonder
are
at
their
old
work
strange
that
there
are
none
of
our
horse
hereabouts
to
check
them
and
indeed
i
marvel
that
the
rogues
dare
venture
so
far
into
tippoo
s
if
it
were
day
we
could
see
their
number
replied
kasim
as
it
is
we
must
take
heart
our
destiny
is
not
so
bad
as
to
cause
us
to
eat
dirt
at
the
hands
of
those
if
i
were
alone
kasim
i
tell
thee
i
would
now
put
myself
at
the
head
of
ye
all
and
we
would
reconnoitre
that
village
perhaps
it
may
only
have
been
a
chance
fire
after
but
soon
after
one
or
two
persons
mounted
on
ponies
arrived
bringing
the
news
that
their
village
had
been
attacked
in
the
evening
and
that
after
the
robbers
had
taken
all
they
could
they
had
set
fire
to
several
houses
and
gone
off
in
a
southerly
was
supposed
towards
gootee
our
very
road
said
the
khan
but
let
us
not
fear
we
had
better
travel
on
slowly
for
it
is
probable
that
they
have
hastened
on
and
long
ere
this
are
beyond
the
pass
in
that
case
there
is
but
little
fear
of
our
overtaking
i
will
stand
by
you
and
the
khanum
to
the
death
said
kasim
and
that
thou
well
knowest
they
said
there
were
not
more
than
fifty
fellows
and
i
dare
say
their
fears
exaggerated
them
at
least
but
if
i
might
suggest
anything
i
would
bring
to
your
consideration
the
propriety
of
hiring
a
few
young
fellows
from
this
village
they
will
be
able
to
protect
the
baggage
and
at
least
assist
us
should
there
be
any
a
good
thought
kasim
see
thou
to
it
when
the
dawn
now
if
thou
canst
find
any
i
will
remain
here
and
kasim
descended
the
tower
and
at
the
foot
found
some
of
the
very
men
he
wanted
they
were
figures
sitting
around
the
fire
they
had
kindled
their
heavy
matchlocks
leaned
against
the
wall
and
their
waists
were
girded
round
with
small
pouches
filled
with
balls
and
other
matters
necessary
for
their
use
there
were
two
or
three
armed
with
swords
and
shields
and
the
whole
group
had
a
wild
and
picturesque
appearance
as
the
fire
upon
which
they
had
thrown
some
straw
at
the
young
man
s
approach
blazed
up
illuminating
the
foot
of
the
tower
and
the
house
near
it
and
causing
the
shadows
of
the
men
to
dance
about
in
distorted
figures
two
or
three
were
sitting
upon
their
hams
between
whom
a
coarse
hooka
went
its
round
and
was
every
now
and
then
replenished
whilst
the
rest
stood
warming
themselves
over
the
blaze
or
lounged
about
at
no
great
distance
salaam
aliekoom
said
kasim
as
he
approached
them

which
among
you

advancing
i

of
these
worthy
men

what
you
want

are
your
servants
what
see
ye
from
the
tower
nothing
but
the
blazing
village
said
kasim
the
fellows
have
not
left
a
standing
they
say
rejoined
the
naik
but
the
place
was
not
defended
for
the
young
men
were
all
absent
and
it
is
supposed
the
mahrattas
had
news
of
this
before
they
attacked
are
arrant
you
have
found
them
so
then
we
have
we
have

beaten

is
not
a
better
shot
in
the
carnatic
that
lingoo
yonder
said
the
naik
he
may
shoot
well
and
not
fight
well
returned
kasim
i
never
feared
moosulman
or
mahratta
yet
said
lingoo
crowed
like
a
good
cock
cried
kasim
but
thou
art
on
thine
own
i
have
fought
with
hyder
ali
many
a
time
and
he
who
has
done
that
may
call
himself
a
soldier
retorted
lingoo
well
so
much
the
better
but
say
what
will
ye
do
here
are
ten
or
twelve
half
that
number
is
enough
to
protect
the
village
especially
as
the
mahrattas
are
gone
on
will
ye
come
pay
us
half
our
due
here
first
said
the
man
and
we
are
of
us
have
i
said
well
brethren
ay
that
is
it
cried
several
how
know
we
that
the
gentlemen
would
not
take
us
on
and
send
us
back
as
the
last
did
by
alla
that
was
shameful
cried
kasim
fear
not
ye
shall
have
half
your
kasim
o
kasim
ali
cried
a
voice
from
the
top
of
the
tower
interrupting
him
was
the
khan
s
and
he
spoke
hurriedly
kasim
come
up
quickly
holy
prophet
what
can
it
be
said
kasim
turning
to
the
tower
followed
by
several
of
the
men
they
were
soon
at
the
summit
what
see
you
yonder
asked
the
khan
pointing
to
a
light
which
was
apparently
not
very
far
off
it
is
only
a
watchfire
in
the
fields
of
the
next
village
said
the
naik
but
as
he
spoke
there
broke
forth
a
blaze
of
brilliant
light
which
at
once
shot
up
to
the
heavens
illuminating
a
few
clouds
that
were
floating
gently
along
apparently
near
the
earth
that
is
no
watchfire
cried
kasim
as
it
increased
in
volume
every
moment
it
is
either
a
house
which
has
accidentally
caught
fire
or
the
mahrattas
are
there
watch
all
of
ye
if
there
are
horsemen
the
light
will
soon
show
there
again
exclaimed
several
at
once
as
a
bright
flame
burst
out
from
another
corner
of
the
village
and
was
followed
by
others
in
various
directions
it
must
be
the
mahrattas
and
yet
none
are
seen
they
are
among
the
houses
said
the
khan
they
will
not
come
out
till
they
are
he
was
right
for
while
all
were
watching
anxiously
the
progress
of
the
flames
which
they
could
see
spreading
from
house
to
house
there
rushed
forth
in
a
tumultuous
manner
from
the
opposite
side
a
body
of
perhaps
twenty
horsemen
whose
long
spears
the
points
of
which
every
instant
flashed
through
the
gloom
proved
them
to
be
the
mahratta
party
base
sons
of
dogs
cried
the
khan
cowards
and
sons
of
impure
mothers
attack
defenceless
people
in
that
way
burn
their
houses
over
their
heads
at
night
oh
for
a
score
of
my
own
risala
for
as
many
more
as
we
are
now
and
those
rogues
should
pay
dearly
for
this
who
will
follow
kasim
ali
cried
the
young
man
by
the
soul
of
the
prophet
we
are
no
thieves
and
our
hearts
are
strong
i
say
one
of
us
is
a
match
for
two
of
those
cowards
who
will
follow
me
i
and
i
and
i
cried
several
and
turned
to
follow
the
young
man
who
had
his
foot
on
the
steps
ready
to
descend
stop
i
command
you
cried
the
khan
this
is
no
time
to
risk
anything
look
yonder
thought
there
were
but
twenty
if
there
is
one
there
are
more
than
they
looked
again
and
beheld
a
fearful
sight
the
now
blazing
village
was
upon
a
gentle
slope
hardly
a
mile
from
them
the
light
caused
the
gloom
of
night
to
appear
absolute
darkness
in
the
midst
of
this
there
was
one
glowing
spot
upon
which
every
eye
rested
in
intense
anxiety
around
the
village
was
an
open
space
upon
which
bright
ground
were
the
dark
figures
of
the
mahratta
horsemen
in
constant
motion
while
the
black
forms
of
persons
on
the
miserable
inhabitants
in
vain
striving
to
as
they
severally
appeared
objects
of
fearful
interest
now
many
would
rush
from
among
the
houses
pursued
by
the
horsemen
several
would
disappear
in
the
gloom
and
they
supposed
had
escaped
whilst
others
but
too
plainly
fell
either
by
the
or
under
the
of
the
horsemen
they
could
even
see
the
flash
of
the
sword
when
the
weapon
descended
and
sometimes
a
faint
shriek
which
was
heard
at
an
interval
of
time
after
a
thrust
or
blow
had
been
seen
plainly
proved
that
it
had
been
successful
by
alla
this
is
hard
to
bear
exclaimed
kasim
to
see
those
poor
creatures
butchered
in
cold
blood
and
yet
have
no
means
of
striking
a
blow
in
their
defence
it
would
be
impossible
for
us
to
do
any
good
said
the
khan
suppose
they
were
to
come
on
here
after
they
had
finished
yonder
i
see
nothing
to
prevent
inshalla
khan
they
will
come
but
what
thinkest
thou
nursingha
they
owe
us
a
grudge
and
may
make
the
attempt
nay
it
is
more
than
probable
for
they
are
stronger
than
ever
and
they
can
not
reckon
on
your
being
we
had
as
well
be
fully
prepared
said
the
khan
have
ye
any
jinjalls
footnote
heavy
on
swivels
the
patél
has
two
said
the
man
run
then
and
bring
them
here
what
powder
ye
can
find
bring
the
patél
himself
too
and
alarm
the
village
kasim
he
continued
wait
thou
here
there
is
an
apartment
in
the
tower
i
will
bring
the
khanum
and
what
valuables
we
have
with
us
i
do
not
fear
danger
but
we
had
better
be
in
a
short
time
the
khan
returned
conducting
his
wife
she
was
veiled
from
head
to
foot
and
kasim
heard
them
distinctly
speaking
as
they
were
coming
up
the
stairs
not
there
not
there
said
the
lady
alone
and
in
that
dark
place
i
should
give
way
to
fears
let
me
ascend
i
pray
thee
am
a
soldier
s
daughter
and
can
bear
to
look
on
what
men
and
soldiers
can
no
no
my
life
my
soul
returned
the
khan
it
is
not
fit
for
thee
if
they
should
fire
upon
us
there
will
be
danger
besides
there
are
many
men
wouldst
not
like
it
remember
too
i
am
near
thee
and
once
the
village
is
alarmed
thou
wilt
have
many
i
am
not
afraid
she
said
i
had
rather
be
with
men
than
women
at
such
a
well
well
ameena
rest
thou
here
now
at
all
events
should
there
be
need
thou
canst
join
us
the
khan
a
moment
afterwards
was
on
the
top
of
the
tower
seest
thou
aught
more
kasim
he
asked
nothing
village
continues
to
burn
and
the
men
are
there
but
either
the
people
have
escaped
or
they
are
dead
for
none
come
out
sound
the
alarm
cried
the
khan
to
some
men
below
who
bearing
a
large
tambourine
drum
and
a
brass
horn
had
assembled
ready
for
the
signal
if
the
horsemen
hear
it
it
will
tell
them
we
are
on
the
the
deep
tone
of
the
drum
and
the
shrill
and
wild
quivering
notes
of
the
horn
soon
aroused
the
villagers
from
their
sleep
and
numbers
were
seen
flying
to
the
tower
for
refuge
believing
the
mahrattas
were
truly
upon
the
skirts
of
the
village
the
patél
was
among
the
rest
accompanied
by
his
family
he
was
soon
upon
the
tower
and
was
roughly
saluted
by
the
khan
thou
art
a
worthy
man
for
a
patél
cried
he
but
for
me
thy
village
might
have
shared
the
fate
of
that
one
yonder
look
shouldest
thou
like
to
see
it
burning
as
that
is
why
wert
thou
not
here
to
watch
o
unfortunate
did
not
stammered
the
patél
not
know
well
at
any
rate
thou
knowest
now
but
as
thou
art
here
do
something
for
thyself
in
alla
s
name
where
is
thy
gun
thy
sword
i
can
only
use
a
gun
noble
sir
and
that
perhaps
to
some
purpose
run
paproo
he
said
to
a
man
near
him
bring
my
gun
hither
now
we
are
awake
the
khan
shall
see
if
there
is
occasion
that
we
can
fight
as
well
as
had
as
well
go
down
said
kasim
and
prepare
the
men
below
the
women
and
children
can
get
into
the
tower
those
whom
it
will
not
contain
must
remain
at
the
foot
in
these
houses
it
will
be
hard
if
any
harm
reaches
them
in
a
short
time
all
was
arranged
the
women
and
children
whose
cries
had
been
distracting
were
in
places
of
safety
and
as
quiet
as
the
neighbourhood
of
the
mahratta
horse
the
sudden
alarm
and
the
natural
discordance
of
their
own
language
the
canarese
would
allow
them
and
on
the
summit
of
the
tower
about
twenty
men
for
whom
there
was
ample
room
were
posted
all
well
armed
with
matchlocks
the
two
jinjalls
were
loaded
a
good
many
men
were
stationed
around
the
foot
of
the
tower
and
all
were
ready
to
give
whatever
should
come
a
very
warm
reception
the
fire
of
the
village
burned
lower
and
lower
and
at
last
became
only
a
dull
red
glow
with
occasionally
a
burst
of
sparks
while
they
speculated
upon
the
route
of
the
horsemen
who
had
disappeared
a
few
of
the
wretched
inhabitants
of
the
village
which
had
been
destroyed
came
running
to
the
foot
of
the
tower
defend
yourselves
defend
yourselves
they
cried
with
loud
voices
the
mahrattas
are
upon
will
be
here
immediately
admit
one
of
them
said
the
khan
let
us
question
the
man
said
he
had
passed
the
horsemen
who
were
trying
to
get
across
a
small
rivulet
the
bed
of
which
was
deep
mud
they
had
not
been
able
to
find
the
ford
and
were
searching
for
it
but
they
knew
of
the
village
were
elated
with
success
and
determined
to
attack
it
they
shall
have
something
for
their
trouble
then
said
the
khan
they
know
not
that
abdool
rhyman
khan
is
here
and
they
will
buy
a
lesson
let
them
come
in
the
name
of
the
most
merciful
away
some
of
ye
cried
the
patél
to
those
below
watch
at
the
outskirts
and
hark
ye
they
will
come
by
the
north
side
is
an
old
house
there
close
to
the
gate
they
are
near
fire
the
thatch
as
it
burns
we
shall
be
able
to
see
and
mark
i
thank
thee
for
that
said
kasim
now
let
all
be
as
silent
as
possible
listen
for
every
sound
shall
hear
their
horses
there
was
not
a
word
spoken
even
the
women
were
still
and
the
children
now
and
then
only
the
wail
of
an
infant
would
be
heard
from
below
all
looked
with
straining
eyes
towards
the
north
side
and
the
best
marksmen
were
placed
there
under
the
direction
of
kasim
thou
art
pretty
sure
of
one
said
the
khan
to
him
i
wish
i
could
shoot
as
well
as
a
steady
hand
and
aim
khan
sahib
not
hurry
if
not
the
man
at
least
thou
canst
hit
the
horse
inshalla
we
shall
have
some
i
had
better
take
one
of
the
jinjalls
the
feringhees
may
they
be
accursed
have
sorely
plagued
us
often
by
firing
a
cannon
full
of
balls
at
us
so
give
me
a
few
i
pray
i
will
ram
them
down
into
the
piece
and
it
will
be
less
liable
to
miss
than
a
single
mashalla
a
wise
thought
said
kasim
handing
him
some
balls
and
a
scattered
fire
of
praises
ran
from
mouth
to
mouth
at
the
khan
s
ingenuity
we
shall
now
see
whether
we
are
to
eat
dirt
or
they
were
now
all
silent
for
awhile
hark
said
kasim
at
length
what
is
that
they
all
listened
more
attentively
the
village
one
then
and
howled
fearfully
they
come
cried
the
khan
i
have
been
too
long
with
bodies
of
horse
not
to
know
the
now
every
man
look
to
his
aim
cried
kasim
cheerfully
half
of
ye
only
fire
and
you
below
fire
if
you
see
almost
as
he
spoke
they
saw
the
light
at
first
they
were
uncertain
whether
the
spies
had
fired
the
old
house
or
burned
so
gently
but
by
degrees
the
flame
crept
along
the
outside
and
round
the
edges
then
it
disappeared
under
the
thatch
and
again
blazed
up
a
little
the
noise
increased
though
they
could
see
no
one
in
the
gloom
but
they
could
hear
very
distinctly
if
one
of
those
owls
would
but
pull
away
a
little
of
the
old
roof
it
would
blaze
up
said
the
patél
by
crishna
look
they
have
even
guessed
my
thoughts
look
noble
khan
they
saw
one
of
the
scouts
advance
from
under
the
cover
of
some
of
the
houses
and
pull
violently
at
one
of
the
projecting
rude
rafters
and
instantly
the
flame
appear
beneath
another
pull
good
fellow
and
thou
hast
earned
five
rupees
cried
the
khan
in
an
ecstasy
as
he
held
the
butt
of
the
another
pull
and
we
shall
have
a
blaze
like
it
seemed
as
if
the
fellow
had
heard
the
khan
s
exclamation
for
he
tugged
in
very
desperation
they
heard
the
roof
crack
at
last
it
fell
in
and
the
sudden
blaze
illuminating
all
around
vividly
fell
on
the
wild
yet
picturesque
group
which
was
rapidly
advancing
over
the
open
space
before
the
village
chapter
vii
the
mahratta
horsemen
did
not
perceive
the
snare
which
had
been
laid
for
them
they
concluded
that
the
fire
was
accidental
and
opportune
since
it
showed
them
the
way
to
their
plunder
and
on
they
came
at
a
fast
gallop
perhaps
wild
figures
they
would
have
been
deemed
at
any
time
much
more
so
when
brandishing
their
long
spears
and
with
loud
shouts
they
dashed
forward
the
light
shone
broad
on
their
muffled
faces
and
on
the
gay
red
housings
of
their
saddles
and
glanced
from
their
and
other
weapons
hurree
bōl
cried
the
leader
to
his
men
turning
round
on
his
saddle
waving
his
sword
which
all
could
see
was
dim
with
blood
hurree
hurree
bōl
arose
the
cry
from
fifty
hoarse
voices
which
mingled
with
the
quick
trampling
of
the
horses
now
cried
the
khan
wait
one
instant
for
the
sake
of
alla
them
come
up
exclaimed
kasim
they
were
close
to
the
burning
hut
when
kasim
whose
matchlock
had
been
steadily
aimed
resting
upon
the
parapet
fired
the
leader
reeled
back
in
his
saddle
waved
his
sword
wildly
in
the
air
and
fell
shouted
the
khan
the
rest
of
the
invocation
being
lost
in
the
loud
report
of
the
cannon
with
it
were
the
flashes
and
reports
of
a
dozen
other
matchlocks
and
as
the
smoke
cleared
away
they
could
plainly
see
four
of
the
men
on
the
ground
struggling
and
two
or
three
others
apparently
badly
hit
supporting
themselves
in
their
saddles
give
me
another
gun
another
gun
cried
kasim
there
is
no
time
to
load
another
gun
i
say
will
no
one
hand
me
one
he
continued
vainly
endeavouring
to
load
his
own
quickly
do
you
not
hear
exclaimed
a
female
voice
near
him
and
as
he
turned
to
look
he
saw
a
figure
snatch
one
from
a
villager
and
hand
it
to
him
as
she
did
so
her
veil
was
ameena
come
on
ye
base
born
cried
the
khan
who
was
pointing
the
remaining
jinjall
at
the
group
which
staggered
by
their
loss
had
halted
for
a
moment
come
on
ye
sons
of
dogs
on
ye
kafirs
and
and
taste
of
death
from
the
hands
of
true
believers
ha
do
ye
hesitate
then
ye
shall
have
it
again
by
alla
and
he
fired
look
you
meer
sahib
he
cried
in
exultation
two
are
by
the
prophet
well
shot
here
is
another
gun
meer
sahib
said
the
same
sweet
voice
and
the
lady
handed
him
one
what
thou
here
my
pearl
shabash
thou
shouldst
have
shot
too
if
thou
couldst
hit
so
thou
wouldst
not
remain
below
no
wonder
with
those
screaming
women
and
thou
art
welcome
here
too
if
thou
darest
to
look
on
and
see
those
murdering
villains
go
down
like

the

rolls
over
and
over
why
do
ye
not
come
o
valiant
eaters
of
dirt
by
your
souls
come
on

more
for
ye
they
have
had
enough
i
think
khan
said
kasim
they
are
drawing
and
they
were
indeed
the
plundering
band
unprovided
with
matchlocks
could
make
little
impression
on
a
village
so
well
defended
and
hastily
turned
about
their
horses
those
who
had
remained
below
were
informed
of
this
by
the
patél
who
had
descended
and
led
by
him
quickly
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
village
from
whence
they
could
fire
without
exposing
themselves
who
will
strike
a
blow
with
kasim
patél
cried
the
youth
who
was
not
now
to
be
controlled
come
who
will
are
the
horses
saddled
in
vain
was
it
that
the
khan
held
him
for
an
instant
and
he
heard
the
voice
of
gentle
entreaty
from
the
lady
he
hurried
down
the
steps
followed
by
several
of
the
khan
s
men
and
throwing
themselves
on
their
horses
they
dashed
after
the
fugitives
they
soon
cleared
the
village
and
what
followed
was
intensely
watched
by
the
khan
and
ameena
holy
alla
protect
the
youth
ejaculated
the
lady
ameen
cried
the
khan
look
he
is
upon
them
now
and
moedeen
and
fazel
after
him
goes
down
beneath
that
cut
for
they
saw
the
sword
of
kasim
flash
in
the
light
he
is
by
another
the
fellow
cuts
at
him
well
parried
by
the
prophet
now
give
it
him
a
curse
on
the
darkness
he
continued
after
a
pause
as
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
he
endeavoured
to
pierce
the
thick
gloom
canst
thou
see
ameena
no
my
lord
i
lost
him
as
you
be
his
shield
to
be
sure
he
is
what
could
those
cowards
do
against
such
an
arm
and
such
a
heart
i
tell
thee
girl
we
had
eaten
dirt
but
for
ameena
sighed
she
remembered
the
excited
cries
of
the
young
man
and
his
flashing
eyes
as
she
handed
him
the
gun
he
is
a
brave
youth
she
said
a
few
scattered
shots
here
and
there
which
were
further
and
further
removed
every
moment
showed
that
the
marauders
were
retreating
and
soon
the
men
began
to
return
one
by
one
in
a
few
minutes
they
saw
kasim
ali
and
his
companions
approaching
quietly
which
assured
them
there
was
no
more
danger
and
that
the
party
had
retired
beyond
the
limits
of
safe
pursuit
come
down
and
meet
them
fairest
said
the
khan
they
who
have
fought
so
well
for
us
deserve
a
warm
as
kasim
and
his
companions
rode
up
they
were
greeted
with
hearty
congratulations
on
their
success
and
all
crowded
round
him
so
thickly
that
he
had
much
ado
to
force
his
way
to
where
the
khan
stood
but
he
reached
him
after
some
little
elbowing
and
remonstrance
and
just
at
that
moment
a
torch
which
had
been
lighted
was
raised
above
the
heads
of
the
crowd
it
disclosed
his
figure
apparently
covered
with
blood
holy
alla
he
is
wounded
exclaimed
the
lady
he
will
bleed
to
death
and
she
moved
as
though
she
would
have
advanced
tut
tut
foolish
one
cried
the
khan
holding
her
back
it
ought
to
be
gladness
to
thee
to
see
the
blood
of
thine
enemies
and
mine
thou
art
not
hurt
kasim
a
trifle
i
believe
slight
wound
on
my
chest
from
one
of
the
rascals
which
hath
bled
somewhat
and
stained
my
clothes
but
he
paid
dearly
for
the
blood
he
i
ll
warrant
he
did
and
as
for
thy
wound
we
must
see
to
it
i
have
some
skill
in
such
matters
and
perhaps
the
khanum
will
be
able
to
find
an
old
sheet
or
something
to
tie
it
up
so
sit
down
here
and
do
thou
ameena
search
for
some
rags
well
so
thou
canst
give
an
account
of
some
of
them
kasim
of
two
khan
sahib
one
fellow
i
cut
down
as
we
is
living
i
other
fought
and
is
dead
for
his
pains
well
i
do
not
begrudge
thee
this
cut
it
will
do
thee
no
harm
see
here
is
the
khanum
with
the
mind
her
this
is
no
time
for
ceremony
with
such
as
thou
ho
daood
zoolficar
some
water
here
and
do
you
kasim
take
off
that
vest
we
shall
soon
see
what
has
happened
a
trifle
a
trifle
after
all
alla
be
praised
he
continued
when
the
garment
was
removed
and
the
broad
and
muscular
chest
of
the
young
man
exposed
to
view
a
few
days
will
heal
it
but
ameena
thought
otherwise
she
had
heard
of
wounds
but
this
was
the
first
she
had
seen
and
a
gash
which
though
not
deep
extended
half
across
the
chest
of
the
young
man
was
in
her
eyes
a
more
serious
matter
than
her
lord
appeared
to
think
she
felt
very
faint
and
sick
as
she
looked
upon
it
but
rallied
on
perceiving
that
kasim
considered
it
a
trifle
as
indeed
it
was
and
readily
assisted
to
bind
it
up
she
was
very
near
him
and
it
was
exquisite
pleasure
to
feel
her
gentle
touch
upon
his
shoulder
as
she
assisted
to
hold
the
bandages
which
the
khan
passed
round
his
chest
he
fancied
too
that
once
her
glance
met
his
and
he
could
not
help
trying
to
catch
it
again
he
succeeded
at
last
through
the
veil
her
lustrous
dark
eyes
flashed
very
brightly
he
could
not
see
their
expression
but
it
was
certain
to
him
that
they
had
sought
his
own
and
met
them
we
want
still
another
handkerchief
or
something
to
tie
over
all
said
the
khan
when
he
had
finished
hast
thou
one
ameena
i
it
is
she
replied
ungirding
one
from
around
her
waist
the
meer
sahib
is
welcome
to
i
owe
a
thousand
obligations
returned
kasim
if
i
were
your
brother
you
could
not
have
done
more
for
me
how
unworthy
am
i
to
receive
such
who
am
but
your
servant
do
not
say
so
cried
both
at
once
thou
art
far
more
than
this
to
ah
thought
kasim
i
am
but
a
moth
playing
around
a
lamp
tempted
by
bright
and
dazzling
light
and
hardly
as
yet
warned
i
am
a
fool
to
think
on
her
but
can
i
ever
forget
her
face
as
she
stood
yonder
and
cheered
me
by
her
presence
second
time
i
have
seen
it
but
perhaps
not
the
the
khan
roused
him
from
his
reverie
lie
down
he
said
there
will
be
the
less
flow
of
kasim
obeyed
readily
for
the
same
fair
hands
that
had
helped
to
bind
his
wound
had
also
spread
a
soft
mattress
for
him
and
placed
a
pillow
for
his
head
perhaps
the
loss
of
blood
had
affected
him
a
little
for
in
a
few
moments
he
felt
drowsy
and
gradually
fell
asleep
and
ameena
sate
watching
him
at
a
little
distance
for
the
khan
had
gone
to
see
what
had
been
done
with
the
bodies
of
those
who
had
fallen
but
as
is
often
the
case
after
violent
excitement
his
sleep
though
at
first
heavy
and
profound
did
not
long
continue
thus
perhaps
too
the
wound
pained
him
for
he
was
restless
and
moved
impatiently
from
side
to
side
the
khan
was
long
absent
and
ameena
still
kept
her
watch
she
might
have
withdrawn
yet
there
was
something
so
exciting
and
novel
to
her
in
her
was
a
source
of
such
quiet
delight
to
her
to
watch
the
features
of
him
who
had
saved
her
life
and
now
had
been
wounded
in
her
defence
she
was
so
thickly
veiled
that
he
could
not
see
her
even
were
he
she
remained
rapidly
her
mind
brought
before
her
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
her
own
young
life
in
the
world
had
hardly
begun
and
yet
more
dangers
had
been
present
to
her
than
she
had
ever
pictured
to
herself
rife
as
her
imagination
had
been
upon
the
subject
when
she
left
her
home
she
had
been
already
rescued
from
death
now
perhaps
from
violence
and
he
who
had
been
the
sole
instrument
of
her
protection
in
the
one
case
and
who
had
fought
under
her
own
eyes
in
the
second
lay
before
her
she
had
hardly
heard
him
speak
yet
she
thought
she
could
remember
every
word
he
had
spoken
and
then
came
vividly
to
her
remembrance
the
glance
the
earnest
hurried
glance
which
told
her
would
have
dwelt
longer
had
it
dared
and
as
she
remembered
this
her
heart
fluttered
under
sensations
very
new
and
almost
painful
to
her
she
could
not
define
them
involuntarily
she
drew
nearer
to
the
sleeping
youth
and
watched
the
more
she
saw
his
brow
contracted
as
if
with
pain
and
as
he
every
now
and
then
stirred
and
the
light
fell
on
his
features
she
could
observe
his
lips
move
as
though
he
spoke
but
she
could
not
catch
a
word
for
a
few
minutes
it
was
thus
but
at
last
he
spoke
interruptedly
it
was
of
war
of
the
fight
he
had
lately
been
engaged
in
and
she
could
distinguish
a
few
words
defiance
to
the
marauders
encouragement
to
the
men
around
then
there
was
another
pause
and
he
slept
peacefully
even
as
a
child
may
he
rest
safely
o
alla
she
said
but
again
he
dreamed
sounds
escaped
him
mutterings
which
were
undistinguishable
she
bent
her
ear
even
closer
could
not
hear
aught
for
awhile
that
she
understood
but
at
length
there
was
one
word
which
made
her
very
soul
bound
within
her
and
caused
in
the
moment
a
feeling
of
choking
and
oppression
in
her
throat
almost
unbearable
ameena
it
was
repeated
twice
distinctly
yet
very
softly
holy
alla
he
knows
my
name
she
said
mentally
he
thinks
of
am
present
to
his
sleeping
fancies
amidst
war
and
turmoil
which
still
pursue
him
how
could
he
have
heard
my
name
but
the
voice
of
the
khan
was
heard
at
some
little
distance
and
interrupted
her
chain
of
questions
he
must
not
find
me
here
she
thought
rising
hastily
and
gently
stealing
from
the
spot
into
the
place
which
had
been
screened
off
for
her
occupation
indeed
for
the
last
few
moments
hidden
thoughts
had
suddenly
sprung
forth
and
she
could
hardly
await
unconcernedly
beside
the
sleeping
youth
him
who
now
sought
her
the
khan
passed
kasim
he
sleeps
well
he
said
to
daood
who
was
with
him
hath
any
one
watched
by
him
no
one
khodawund
the
men
were
all
with
my
that
was
ill
one
of
ye
should
have
remained
where
is
that
idle
cook
he
hath
no
need
of
rest
let
him
sit
up
here
if
he
can
keep
his
eyes
open
and
do
ye
all
take
what
sleep
ye
can
for
we
shall
start
inshalla
ere
noon
you
are
to
remain
with
kasim
sahib
said
daood
to
the
cook
rousing
him
and
not
to
stir
till
morning
breaks
or
he
thou
hear
i
do
good
daood
but
methinks
thou
mightest
sit
with
me
too
seeing
that
it
is
near
morning
by
thy
beard
i
do
not
like
being
o
coward
thou
art
not
alone
see
thou
hast
the
hero
of
the
night
lying
beside
who
has
slain
some
men
since
he
last
ate
whereas
thou
hast
not
even
slain
a
fowl
i
tell
thee
there
is
no
danger
yonder
is
my
shall
not
be
far
off
if
thou
wantest
soon
all
was
silent
around
even
the
village
dogs
had
ceased
to
bark
the
clamour
of
women
and
of
crying
frightened
children
had
subsided
and
except
the
watchfires
in
several
parts
which
threw
up
their
strong
red
glare
against
the
sky
around
which
most
of
the
villagers
were
assembled
in
groups
nothing
indicated
that
any
conflict
or
alarm
had
taken
place
scattered
about
the
khan
s
attendants
and
servants
lay
wrapped
in
their
sheets
in
deep
sleep
the
horses
even
apparently
secure
of
rest
had
lain
down
and
all
was
still
except
one
of
the
horses
which
had
been
captured
which
every
now
and
then
sent
up
a
shrill
neigh
that
sounded
far
and
near
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
but
above
on
the
tower
the
patél
and
several
of
his
best
men
still
kept
watch
kasim
slept
still
restlessly
and
often
sighed
and
muttered
in
his
sleep
his
thoughts
are
with
the
battle
thought
zoolficar
they
say
it
was
a
brave
sight
to
see
the
mahrattas
go
down
one
by
one
before
his
aim
he
shot
them
as
he
would
deer
in
the
their
mothers
be
polluted
alla
alla
guide
us
safely
now
this
is
the
third
alarm
we
have
had
in
this
accursed
hark
what
was
that
he
said
again
ameena
should
he
dream
of
her
poor
youth
he
would
have
been
a
fitter
mate
for
her
than
that
man
of
camps
and
battles
but
it
may
not
be
of
her
he
he
has
some
one
he
loves
of
the
same
name
ay
it
is
very
likely
so
dream
on
meer
sahib
may
thy
slumbers
be
lighter
but
they
were
not
after
little
more
than
an
hour
s
restless
slumber
he
awoke
and
found
the
worthy
functionary
by
his
side
how
thou
here
zoolfoo
art
thou
not
sleepy
it
was
my
lord
s
order
that
i
should
watch
you
noble
sir
and
i
only
obey
it
methinks
you
have
rested
but
indifferently
for
your
sleep
has
been
disturbed
and
you
have
been
ah
well
i
have
but
few
secrets
he
said
gaily
so
i
fear
not
for
the
words
and
in
truth
this
cut
is
rather
painful
and
too
tightly
bandaged
see
if
thou
canst
find
a
barber
zoolfoo
i
will
have
these
straps
if
my
lord
will
trust
me
replied
zoolfoo
i
will
ease
his
pain
ere
i
was
a
cook
i
was
a
barber
and
hyderabad
is
not
an
indifferent
place
to
learn
how
to
dress
wounds
mashalla
our
young
men
are
rare
hands
at
street
well
do
thy
this
hour
it
will
be
hard
to
find
any
zoolfoo
was
as
good
as
his
word
in
a
short
time
the
bandages
were
arranged
more
easily
as
the
bleeding
had
stopped
in
a
great
measure
and
kasim
found
himself
refreshed
by
the
change
a
hooka
too
was
not
to
be
despised
and
this
zoolfoo
soon
brought
from
among
his
stores
gradually
kasim
lead
him
to
talk
of
his
city
of
his
home
of
his
family
he
earnestly
wished
to
know
more
particulars
of
the
khanum
of
her
early
life
and
her
marriage
zoolfoo
mentioned
his
sister
ay
her
who
thou
saidst
was
servant
in
the
khanum
s
the
same
she
was
the
khanum
s
nurse
for
awhile
and
she
is
very
fond
of
why
did
she
not
bring
her
then
she
wished
to
come
but
the
khan
said
she
would
be
a
trouble
on
the
road
and
he
left
her
behind
perhaps
the
khanum
did
not
wish
it
not
wish
it
sir
she
was
grieved
to
part
with
her
for
she
had
tended
her
from
her
birth
and
loved
her
as
her
own
then
you
have
often
heard
of
her
i
have
a
thousand
times
my
sister
was
her
own
attendant
and
never
quitted
her
till
the
hour
of
her
know
you
then
how
she
came
to
marry
the
khan
you
said
once
before
that
he
was
of
no
i
will
tell
you
said
the
cook
her
father
is
a
munsubdar
of
nizam
ali
s
court
nominally
he
has
good
pay
and
one
or
two
villages
to
support
his
rank
but
he
was
expensive
in
his
youth
for
he
was
a
gay
man
and
perhaps
not
over
scrupulous
gradually
the
difficulties
of
the
government
caused
all
the
salaries
of
the
officers
to
fall
into
arrears
then
came
with
that
a
train
of
distresses
the
elephant
was
sold
some
jewels
pledged
some
horses
went
and
their
servants
were
discharged
there
were
heavy
mortgages
made
upon
the
villages
and
other
difficulties
occurred
the
interest
accumulated
and
the
creditors
grew
very
clamorous
some
more
jewels
were
sold
and
they
were
quieted
for
awhile
but
lately
they
were
in
distress
i
heard
my
sister
told
me
her

the

cried
with

aroused
the

the

appropriated

now
therefore
our
travellers
are
once
more
upon
the
wide
plains
moving
warily
and
close
together
altogether
they
are
twelve
good
horsemen
and
with
the

seven
villagers
armed
with
long

and
the

on

the

had

a
very
formidable
appearance
while
the
dry
gravelly
road
allows
them
to
push
forward
at
a
good
pace
without
interruption
the
road
from
bellary
to
the
mysore
country
appears
flat
but
in
reality
is
not
so
the
land
rises
in
long
and
gentle
undulations
some
thousand
feet
in
the
course
of
about
one
hundred
miles
is
from
the
town
of
bellary
to
where
it
enters
a
rugged
pass
between
some
mountains
one
side
of
which
is
formed
by
the
rough
and
stony
back
of
the
fort
of
pencondah
as
the
traveller
advances
from
bellary
he
sees
these
undulations
each
of
many
miles
perhaps
in
length
and
when
arrived
at
the
top
of
one
expecting
to
descend
he
finds
another
spread
out
before
him
perhaps
of
equal
length
the
summit
of
which
he
must
reach
in
like
manner
the
difference
this
causes
in
the
climate
is
most
remarkable
a
few
days
travel
produces
an
entire
revolution
and
from
the
steaming
heat
of
the
carnatic
at
bellary
and
above
it
the
traveller
as
he
proceeds
southward
breathes
a
purer
cooler
and
more
genial
atmosphere
the
heat
which
had
existed
where
we
began
our
narrative
and
which
rendered
travelling
irksome
had
now
given
place
to
coolness
which
even
at
near
midday
made
them
glad
to
wrap
shawls
or
other
warm
garments
around
them
and
thus
while
it
invigorated
man
and
beast
enabled
them
to
push
on
rapidly
without
fatigue
they
had
travelled
for
two
days
without
alarm
and
were
within
an
easy
distance
of
the
entrance
of
the
pass
when
on
arriving
at
the
top
of
one
of
the
summits
we
have
mentioned
they
saw
with
some
alarm
a
body
of
horse
before
them
scattered
and
apparently
on
the
same
track
as
themselves
it
is
the
mahrattas
cried
the
khan
true
said
kasim
but
i
fear
them
not
are
too
strong
see
the
rogues
turn
they
do
said
the
khan
but
never
fear
let
us
spread
out
a
little
on
each
side
they
think
us
some
small
party
whom
they
can
plunder
with
the
little
manœuvre
was
done
and
had
an
instant
effect
the
mahratta
horsemen
who
were
coming
down
about
a
mile
distant
at
the
gallop
suddenly
halted
held
a
hurried
consultation
for
awhile
and
then
struck
off
to
the
right
down
a
road
which
lead
to
the
westward
and
having
gone
a
good
distance
quite
out
of
shot
again
halted
they
are
wary
fellows
said
kasim
and
have
profited
by
our
former
lesson
but
as
we
pass
them
we
will
fire
a
shot
or
two
that
will
teach
them
their
distance
or
i
am
it
was
done
and
had
the
desired
effect
the
horsemen
moved
further
away
though
they
travelled
in
a
parallel
line
shots
were
however
discharged
from
time
to
time
and
the
whole
party
including
the
lady
were
amused
at
their
consternation
as
they
scattered
at
every
discharge
gradually
as
they
neared
the
pass
the
mahrattas
dropped
behind
and
after
they
had
entered
the
rocky
valley
the
first
turn
shut
them
from
their
view
altogether
now
we
are
properly
on
our
own
ground
said
the
khan
and
soon
we
shall
see
one
of
the
frontier
posts
there
we
shall
be
secure
from
all
alarms
and
from
thence
to
the
city
there
is
no
as
he
said
after
a
short
travel
further
they
approached
a
strong
village
well
garrisoned
and
here
after
their
many
perils
and
escapes
they
rested
safely
for
three
days
ere
they
pursued
their
journey
indeed
kasim
s
wound
needed
rest
the
information
the
khan
gave
was
acted
upon
and
a
party
of
horse
scoured
the
country
in
every
direction
but
without
success
the
marauders
had
made
their
escape
and
were
no
more
seen

the
usual
privilege
of

to
transport
our
readers
where
and
as
suddenly
as
we
please
and
to
take
up
our
wings
and
be
off
to
the
to
the
perfect
understanding
of
the
events
connected
with
this
veritable
history
therefore
we
feel
ourselves
obliged
to
retrograde
a
few
years
and
to
leave
the
glowing
climate
of
the
east
for
a
while
to
breathe
in
idea

colder

more
congenial
air
of

it
was
on
the
evening
then
of
a
wet
and
sleety
day
of
december
that
a
large
and
merry
family
group
sat
around
a
cheerful
fire
in
the
comfortable
of
the
rectory
of
alston
in
it
consisted
of
the
rector
his
lady
and
two
sons
one
of
whom
edward
had
returned
from
college
for
the
vacation
and
who
was
a
youth
of
perhaps
eighteen
years
of
age
his
brother
charles
was
somewhat
younger
of
that
awkward
period
of
life
between
school
and
college
which
is
not
often
productive
of
much
gratification
to
the
possessor
and
which
all
desire
to
see
changed
mothers
perhaps
again
to
childhood
to
manhood
sisters
to
anything
more
agreeable
and
ornamental
than
the
awkwardness
and
peculiarly
attendant
upon
that
epoch
in
life
there
were
three
girls
one
between
edward
and
charles
and
another
some
years
younger
a
third
as
yet
a
child
anywhere
any
individual
of
the
family
would
have
been
very
remarkable
for
good
looks
but
here
when
all
were
assembled
together
they
were
a
sight
round
that
cheerful
blazing
fire
which
caused
the
eye
of
the
mother
to
glisten
with
something
like
a
tear
of
pleasure
as
she
looked
around
the
circle
and
the
heart
of
the
father
to
swell
with
proud
satisfaction
compton
the
rector
the
second
son
of
a
baronet
of
the
county
had
early
been
destined
to
the
church
in
addition
to
a
very
handsome
private
fortune
bequeathed
to
him
by
his
father
the
rich
living
of
alston
had
been
secured
to
him
while
he
was
at
college
and
he
had
succeeded
to
it
as
soon
as
he
was
of
age
to
be
ordained
he
had
married
early
in
life
the
sister
of
an
old
friend
and
college
chum
also
a
baronet
of
a
neighbouring
county
and
the
union
had
proved
one
of
continued
happiness
with
an
ample
fortune

and
refined
tastes
and
pursuits
excellent
musician
a
tolerable
painter
a
good
classic
and
with
literary
abilities
above

standard
compton
had
resources
within
himself
which
ensured
him
a
placid
and
equable
enjoyment
of
life
a
sincere
and
pious
man
his
ministry
was
a
blessing
to
his
numerous
parishioners
and
his
society
where
so
much
intelligence
and
accomplishment
prevailed
was
eagerly
sought
for
by
all
the
families
of
the
county
neighbourhood
with
no
remarkable
strength
of
character
compton
was
yet
an
admirable
woman
she
was
possessed
of
but
few
accomplishments
but
then
those
were
not
the
days
when
youth
was
crammed
with
knowledge
she
had
however
a
fair
share
for
a
lady
of
that
period
perhaps
her
talent
for
music
had
partly
attracted
the
notice
and
helped
with
her
amiable
disposition
and
great
personal
charms
to
win
the
admiration
and
eventually
to
secure
the
affections
of
her
husband
in
her
career
as
a
mother
she
had
been
kind
and
loving
even
beyond
a
mother
s
usual
fondness
and
if
at
times
her
excess
of
affection
had
overpowered
the
sense
of
her
duty
in
checking
the
foibles
of
her
children
yet
she
had
so
gentle
and
admirable
a
monitor
at
her
side
one
whose
advice
and
example
she
esteemed
the
most
precious
blessings
vouchsafed
to
her
that
she
had
been
enabled
not
only
to
bring
up
her
children
in
perfect
obedience
to
her
and
in
strict
moral
and
religious
principles
but
in
that
complete
harmony
of
intercourse
among
themselves
the
result
of
judicious
training
and
pure
example
in
truth
so
completely
united
a
family
though
perhaps
not
of
rare
occurrence
is
not
so
often
to
be
seen
as
might
be
desirable
to
society
and
the
young
comptons
were
noted
through
the
neighbourhood
for
their
extreme
and
for
the
devoted
affection
they
bore
one
another
happy
indeed
as
we
know
the
family
to
have
been
it
must
needs
have
been
from
its
constitution
had
suffered
already
one
stroke
of
sorrow
which
mingling
as
it
ever
will
in
all
the
affairs
of
life
and
with
those
who
apparently
are
farthest
removed
from
its
influence
had
come
in
a
shape
and
at
a
time
but
little
expected
by
any
their
eldest
son
herbert
was
a
yet
youth
he
was
destined
by
his
father
for
the
church
in
the
offices
of
which
he
himself
felt
such
satisfaction
that
no
employment
or
pursuit
in
life
he
thought
could
equal
the
gratification
afforded
by
them
herbert
however
had
from
the
first
shown
an
unconquerable
repugnance
to
the
sacred
calling
it
had
been
proposed
to
him
on
his
leaving
school
preparatory
to
his
entering
on
his
college
course
and
though
he
had
gone
through
one
or
two
terms
at
oxford
with
credit
yet
he
continued
to
implore
his
father
so
strongly
not
to
persist
in
destining
him
to
this
profession
that
at
last
compton
yielded
and
the
plan
was
abandoned
nor
was
compton
surprised
to
hear
a
declaration
made
with
much
fear
and
hesitation
that
a
military
life
of
all
others
was
that
in
which
he
felt
assured
he
should
succeed
best
as
it
was
most
consonant
to
his
high
spirit
and
daring
character
much
entreaty
was
gentle
loving
both
his
parents
especially
his
mother
to
whom
it
was
an
agonising
thought
that
her
her
boy
of
whom
she
was
so
proud
should
embrace
a
profession
which
would
expose
him
to
other
than
the
ordinary
dangers
of
life
all
was
however
of
no
avail
and
at
the
age
of
eighteen
or
thereabouts
his
father
whose
family
influence
was
great
was
enabled
to
purchase
for
him
a
commission
in
a
regiment
of
the
line
there
was
at
that
time
no
immediate
cause
to
suppose
that
the
regiment
would
be
called
out
on
active
service
and
as
that
to
which
he
had
been
appointed
was
after
a
short
time
quartered
in
their
own
neighbourhood
they
had
the
gratification
of
seeing
herbert
happy
fond
of
his
corps
and
his
duties
beloved
by
his
brother
officers
and
studying
all
the
details
of
science
connected
with
his
new
profession
and
indeed
his
noble
appearance
in
his
uniform
and
his
now
gay
cheerful
different
from
what
his
deportment
had
been
while
in
uncertainty
about
himself
and
his
future
a
great
degree
reconciled
his
parents
to
the
change
in
their
plans
for
his
life
promotion
if
the
means
were
at
hand
was
no
difficult
matter
to
obtain
in
those
days
and
compton
by
the
advice
of
a
relative
a
general
officer
who
had
assisted
him
in
obtaining
the
commission
in
the
first
instance
had
purchased
herbert
on
as
far
as
a
company
and
was
waiting
for
a
favourable
opportunity
for
exchanging
him
into
a
cavalry
regiment
but
while
the
negotiations
for
purchase
were
proceeding
sudden
orders
arrived
for
the
regiment
to
proceed
on
foreign
service
india
in
fact
where
the
increased
possessions
of
the
east
india
company
required
additional
protection
this
news
was
a
thunderbolt
to
the
family
coming
as
it
did
so
unexpectedly
it
might
have
been
foreseen
and
thought
of
but
it
had
not
for
herbert
was
with
them
and
that
was
enough
and
any
idea
of
his
leaving
them
if
distantly
contemplated
had
never
been
allowed
to
dwell
in
their
hearts
it
was
in
vain
that
compton
besought
herbert
in
the
agony
of
her
maternal
affection
to
resign
to
exchange
to
ask
for
leave
of
absence
to
carry
into
effect
the
negotiations
which
had
been
pending
the
young
man
loved
his
mother
with
an
intensity
of
affection
but
he
saw
also
to
yield
to
its
dictates
in
this
instance
would
be
to
forfeit
his
honour
and
the
obligations
of
his
duty
compton
forbore
to
urge
him
at
all
his
fine
feelings
at
once
told
him
that
the
young
man
was
right
and
though
it
was
a
sore
trial
to
part
with
one
so
dear
to
relinquish
him
to
the
chances
of
hard
service
in
so
distant
and
then
unknown
a
land
yet
he
did
not
murmur
and
in
many
a
secret
prayer
in
his
closet
and
daily
in
his
family
worship
commended
him
as
a
father
s
affection
only
can
prompt
prayer
for
a
child
to
the
protection
of
that
merciful
providence
which
had
as
yet
bestowed
on
him
and
his
unnumbered
blessings
but
there
was
yet
another
on
whom
this
blow
fell
even
more
heavily
than
on
those
we
had
mentioned
amy
hayward
the
only
daughter
of
a
gentleman
of
fortune
whose
estate
joined
the
fields
and
extensive
lawns
and
grounds
which
formed
the
glebe
of
the
rectory
had
from
the
earliest
times
she
could
remember
been
the
companion
and
playmate
of
all
the
comptons
her
two
brothers
had
shared
the
intimacy
with
her
and
whenever
the
boys
were
at
their
respective
homes
there
was
a
daily
intercourse
kept
up
between
them
meetings
rambles
in
beechwood
park
fishing
in
the
brawling
which
ran
through
it
nutting
in
its
noble
woods
and
a
thousand
other
joyous
amusements
peculiar
to
a
happy
country
childhood
we
say
country
childhood
for
we
feel
that
there
is
the
widest
difference
between
that
and
a
childhood
spent
in
a
town
with
the
former
there
is
a
store
of
remembrances
of
gentle
pleasures
of
those
natural
delights
which
are
so
inseparable
to
boyhood
or
girlhood
the
first
gushes
of
the
springs
of
feeling
are
expanded
among
the
beauties
of
natural
scenes
in
themselves
peaceful
and
speaking
quiet
to
the
heart
ever
too
prone
to
excitement
when
full
vent
is
given
to
joyous
spirits
every
occupation
is
fraught
with
delights
which
if
the
faintest
remembrance
remains
in
after
life
are
treasured
up
as
the
purest
perhaps
of
all
the
pleasurable
impressions
the
heart
has
ever
known
how
different
is
the
town
boy
he
is
a
man
before
his
time
and
in
that
one
word
how
much
meaning
is
there
how
much
less
many
cares
his
amusements
lack
the
ease
of
hilarity
and
freedom
he
sees
the
dull
monotonous
streets
teeming
with
spectacles
of
vice
or
misery
endless
form
of
busy
man
ever
before
him
instead
of
bright
skies
the
green
recesses
of
the
woods
the
fresh
balmy
air
the
thousand
exquisite
creations
of
nature
ever
appealing
to
his
best
sympathies
a
city
can
teach
him
little
that
can
remain
to
benefit
his
understanding
or
invigorate
its
keenest
and
most
delicious
enjoyment
a
complete
appreciation
of
nature
in
all
her
forms
but
on
the
contrary
it
may
induce
a
callousness
which
too
often
grows
upon
him
in
after
life
and
causes
those
simple
pleasures
to
be
despised
or
unnoticed
in
which
after
all
perhaps
are
contained
the
germs
of
the
purest
enjoyment
amy
was
a
few
years
younger
than
herbert
beautiful
as
a
child
that
beauty
had
grown
up
with
her
and
appeared
to
increase
but
her
features
were
not
regular
nor
could
she
properly
be
called
handsome
and
yet
if
large
lustrous
loving
eyes
a
fair
and
bright
complexion
and
long
and
light
brown
curling
hair
with
a
small
figure
in
which
roundness
activity
and
extreme
grace
were
combined
can
be
called
beauty
she
possessed
it
eminently
her
face
too
which
was
ever
varying
in
expression
and
lighted
up
with
intelligence
was
a
fair
index
to
her
mind
of
affection
and
keen
perception
of
beauty
if
herbert
had
not
the
latter
quality
so
enthusiastically
as
she
had
he
at
least
had
sufficient
with
cultivation
to
make
him
a
tolerable
draughtsman
and
beechwood
park
contained
so
many
natural
charms
that
as
they
grew
up
there
was
scarcely
a
point
of
blue
and
distant
landscape
rocky
brawling
stream
or
quiet
glade
which
they
had
not
sketched
in
company
we
have
said
they
had
been
inseparable
from
from
the
earliest
times
though
the
young
comptons
and
haywards
joined
in
all
their
pastimes
yet
herbert
had
ever
a
quiet
stroll
with
amy
her
garden
her
greenhouse
her
rabbits
her
fowls
her
gold
and
silver
were
of
as
much
interest
to
him
for
her
sake
as
to
herself
and
so
it
had
continued
childish
cares
and
pastimes
had
given
place
to
more
matured
amusements
and
pursuits
and
the
intercourse
of
the
elders
of
the
families
continued
to
be
so
harmonious
that
no
interruption
had
ever
occurred
to
their
constant
society
if
herbert
or
amy
had
been
questioned
on
the
subject
they
could
hardly
have
said
that
as
yet
they
loved
but
it
would
be
unnatural
to
suppose
that
knowing
and
appreciating
each
other
as
they
did
they
should
not
have
loved
and
that
ardently
the
fire
had
been
kindled
long
ago
and
slumbered
only
for
a
passing
breath
of
excitement
to
fan
it
into
a
bright
and
enduring
flame
it
was
then
on
the
day
which
followed
a
night
of
intense
anguish
to
on
which
no
longer
any
opposition
had
been
made
to
herbert
s
departure
and
they
were
beginning
to
bear
to
talk
of
it
with
some
calmness
that
compton
said
to
his
lady
as
they
sat
after
breakfast
you
had
better
write
this
sad
news
to
the
haywards
my
love
they
have
always
felt
such
an
interest
in
herbert
s
welfare
that
they
ought
to
hear
this
from
ourselves
before
it
is
carried
there
by
the
servants
and
perhaps
broken
abruptly
to
i
will
be
the
bearer
of
the
news
myself
said
herbert
starting
up
no
one
ought
to
tell
it
but
me
and
it
would
distress
you
dear
mother
to
write
it
besides
i
promised
to
go
over
to
amy
either
yesterday
or
to
sketch
with
her
as
she
wants
to
see
the
new
style
i
have
thank
you
my
kind
darling
she
replied
you
have
indeed
saved
me
the
necessity
of
inflicting
a
pang
on
them
and
one
on
myself
too
and
you
must
screw
up
your
courage
to
the
when
you
mention
it
to
amy
she
added
almost
gaily
with
some
emphasis
on
the
name
poor
child
she
will
grieve
to
hear
it
indeed
yes
she
will
be
sorry
very
sorry
i
know
said
herbert
but
it
can
t
be
helped
now
and
i
must
put
as
good
a
face
as
i
can
upon
the
matter
to
them
all
i
will
be
as
gay
as
i
can
he
said
taking
up
his
hat
and
opening
the
door
and
will
not
be
long
poor
fellow
the
last
words
were
tremulous
enough
for
a
gay
captain
to
utter
and
his
mother
and
father
thought
so
too
it
will
be
unexpected
to
them
he
said
after
a
painful
pause
very
indeed
dearest
was
the
only
reply
she
could
make
for
her
tears
were
flowing
silently
and
fast
chapter
ix
for
the
convenience
of
the
families
a
gravel
walk
had
been
made
through
the
rectory
fields
to
the
little
river
which
divided
them
from
the
park
across
this
hayward
had
thrown
a
very
elegant
rustic
bridge
the
joint
design
of
amy
and
herbert
to
replace
a
rude
yet
picturesque
one
formed
of
planks
with
siderails
which
had
existed
previously
over
this
herbert
rapidly
passed
onwards
into
the
park
and
avoiding
the
walk
which
had
been
carried
by
a
considerable
detour
through
some
beautiful
glades
struck
at
once
across
the
sward
in
a
direct
line
for
the
house
at
any
other
time
the
extreme
beauty
of
the
day
and
of
the
park
under
its
influence
would
not
have
failed
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
young
man
and
to
have
caused
him
to
stop
more
than
once
to
admire
for
the
hundredth
time
some
noble
avenues
of
beech
and
herd
of
deer
or
flock
of
sheep
or
some
exquisite
effect
of
light
and
shade
as
the
soft
floating
clouds
transiently
caused
it
he
would
perhaps
have
sauntered
gently
but
now
he
hurried
on
wrapt
in
his
own
reflections
and
they
were
not
of
the
most
agreeable
or
intelligible
kind
the
flocks
of
sheep
as
he
passed
fled
startled
at
his
quick
approach
while
the
deer
raised
themselves
from
their
recumbent
postures
and
gazed
wonderingly
at
him
whom
they
almost
knew
by
heaven
he
exclaimed
as
he
reached
the
and
rang
for
admittance
i
hardly
know
what
i
am
come
about
or
what
to
say
but
it
must
be
done
i
will
let
things
take
their
chance
i
can
invent
no
plan
of
proceeding
which
will
spare
them
pain
or
myself
either
no
leave
it
to
the
force
of
is
any
one
at
home
edward
he
said
to
the
footman
who
answered
the
bell
yes
sir
master
and
miss
amy
are
in
the
thank
you
and
he
passed
on
with
a
beating
heart
well
noble
captain
what
news
ah
i
am
so
glad
you
are
come
herbert
i
want
you
much
were
the
greetings
of
the
father
and
daughter
in
their
hearty
unformal
and
affectionate
manner
mamma
tried
to
persuade
me
to
go
out
with
her
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
somervilles
continued
amy
but
i
would
not
for
i
felt
somehow
or
other
that
you
would
come
and
as
i
said
i
want
you
you
have
been
such
a
truant
of
late
that
i
was
really
beginning
to
be
half
angry
with
you
so
ponder
well
on
the
escape
you
have
made
of
my
wrath
by
this
opportune
herbert
said
something
about
his
duties
only
half
intelligible
to
himself
yes
continued
the
girl
those
duties
are
horrid
things
ever
since
you
have
been
a
soldier
we
have
seen
nothing
of
you
at
all
and
i
am
very
much
disposed
to
be
very
angry
with
your
colonel
and
all
your
regiment
for
not
giving
you
perpetual
leave
of
absence
i
declare
i
have
no
companion
now
for
you
know
the
boys
are
both
at
college
he
is
very
naughty
not
to
come
oftener
he
not
papa
perhaps
herbert
is
right
my
love
in
not
humouring
so
giddy
a
girl
as
yourself
but
here
he
is
now
so
make
the
most
of
him
for
there
may
be
another
week
or
fortnight
of
duty
which
he
has
come
to
tell
you
how
near
he
had
guessed
the
truth
so
far
short
of
its
sad
reality
herbert
winced
i
am
sure
if
i
had
but
known
that
i
was
wanted
i
would
have
come
he
said
hesitatingly
but
the
truth
is
i
have
been
occupied
both
at
home
and
at
the
barracks
for
the
last
few
days
by
some
business
which
i
could
not
well
your
being
here
proves
that
to
be
all
over
and
so
you
are
not
to
think
of
going
away
said
amy
i
want
you
to
help
me
with
a
drawing
i
am
doing
for
lady
somerville
and
as
she
is
a
great
connoisseur
it
must
be
as
good
as
our
united
heads
and
fingers
can
make
it
and
before
we
sit
down
to
that
i
wish
you
to
run
down
to
the
river
with
me
and
sketch
a
group
of
rocks
and
reeds
which
i
want
for
the
foreground
of
my
picture
now
no
excuses
herbert
though
you
look
as
if
you
were
going
to
begin
some
will
not
hear
them
wait
here
with
papa
till
i
put
on
my
bonnet
and
get
my
now
don
t
let
him
go
i
pray
you
papa
she
continued
looking
back
from
the
door
she
had
just
opened
for
i
shall
not
be
five
minutes
you
hear
your
doom
herbert
said
hayward
gaily
so
come
sit
down
tell
me
all
about
your
regiment
and
how
this
exchange
of
yours
prospers
a
dashing
young
fellow
like
you
ought
to
be
in
the
cavalry
and
i
hope
to
hear
of
your
soon
exchanging
the
scarlet
for
the
that
is
all
off
i
am
sorry
to
say
sir
replied
herbert
off
what
do
you
mean
surely
your
father
told
me
that
he
had
lodged
the
money
for
the
exchange
and
that
the
matter
had
only
to
pass
through
the
forms
of
the
war
so
he
had
but
an
event
has
happened
which
has
put
an
end
to
all
our
hopes
upon
the
what
is
the
man
dead
no
sir
he
is
well
enough
and
herbert
hesitated
but
what
herbert
if
there
is
anything
that
i
can
do
know
there
can
be
no
ceremony
between
no
no
sir
i
well
know
that
why
what
is
the
matter
with
the
boy
cried
hayward
observing
that
herbert
seemed
to
be
struggling
with
some
strong
emotion
has
anything
happened
you
may
as
well
know
it
at
once
replied
herbert
mastering
his
feelings
i
am
come
on
purpose
to
tell
it
to
you
lest
you
should
hear
it
in
some
manner
my
regiment
is
ordered
abroad
and
i
am
to
go
of
well
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
said
hayward
you
will
have
a
pleasant
continental
frolic
and
see
something
of
the
world
sorry
too
since
we
shall
lose
you
for
a
but
our
destination
is
not
the
continent
but
india
said
herbert
sadly
good
god
you
don
t
mean
that
exclaimed
hayward
rising
pardon
me
my
dear
boy
that
i
should
have
spoken
lightly
on
a
subject
which
is
so
distressing
india
that
indeed
is
a
sad
word
can
nothing
be
done
to
prevent
this
can
not
you
exchange
can
not
i
would
not
if
i
were
able
dear
sir
said
herbert
i
feel
this
to
be
my
duty
i
could
not
in
any
honour
leave
the
regiment
at
such
a
time
without
a
suspicion
of
the
basest
motives
being
attached
to
my
tut
tut
herbert
the
thing
is
done
every
day
so
let
not
that
distress
or
prevent
herbert
shook
his
head
i
say
it
is
i
could
tell
you
a
dozen
perhaps
you
might
where
the
only
enemy
was
the
climate
but
our
possessions
in
the
east
are
menaced
and
the
service
will
be
active
i
learned
this
when
the
news
came
to
the
regiment
and
as
none
of
the
officers
have
attempted
an
exchange
except
one
or
two
whose
characters
are
not
high
i
feel
that
i
can
not
and
you
are
right
herbert
said
hayward
after
a
pause
you
are
right
god
help
your
parents
your
poor
will
be
a
sad
blow
to
her
and
he
paused
as
a
tear
glistened
in
his
eyes
it
was
at
first
certainly
sir
but
they
are
already
more
composed
and
are
beginning
to
bear
to
talk
of
and
how
soon
are
you
to
go
the
government
will
give
you
some
time
surely
for
very
little
i
am
sorry
to
say
we
march
for
dover
on
monday
and
sail
we
hear
in
ten
days
or
a
monday
bless
me
and
is
thursday
this
is
the
worse
news
of
all
poor
amy
what
will
she
say
yes
sir
said
herbert
i
want
your
advice
whether
to
mention
it
to
her
myself
or
not
i
can
not
refuse
to
accompany
her
now
indeed
you
saw
she
would
take
no
denial
i
will
do
exactly
as
you
why
it
is
an
unpleasant
matter
to
any
of
us
to
think
or
speak
of
and
i
really
do
not
know
what
to
say
but
as
you
are
the
person
concerned
and
can
give
her
every
information
yourself
continued
hayward
after
a
pause
perhaps
you
had
better
talk
it
over
with
her
break
it
as
gently
as
you
can
however
for
it
would
be
useless
to
deny
to
you
that
she
will
be
very
sorry
to
hear
come
herbert
cried
amy
opening
the
door
i
have
been
longer
away
than
i
thought
come
here
are
books
and
paper
and
my
stool
for
you
to
carry
so
make
you
will
be
discreet
with
her
herbert
said
hayward
gently
giving
his
hand
herbert
could
only
press
it
in
acknowledgment
in
a
moment
afterwards
they
were
gone
hayward
turned
to
the
window
involuntarily
to
watch
them
as
they
descended
the
gentle
slope
of
the
lawn
there
was
a
vague
thought
in
his
mind
that
they
had
better
not
have
gone
but
as
he
could
find
no
reason
for
the
idea
he
dismissed
it
he
was
a
benevolent
man
he
had
had
neither
the
necessity
nor
the
inclination
to
study
character
and
could
not
at
once
estimate
the
effect
such
a
communication
as
his
daughter
was
about
to
receive
would
have
upon
her
nor
did
it
at
once
strike
him
that
the
long
and
intimate
association
she
had
held
with
herbert
could
have
produced
any
tenderer
feeling
than
she
had
ever
expressed
or
appeared
to
entertain
her
mother
had
she
been
there
might
have
judged
differently
but
as
hayward
soliloquised
as
their
retreating
figures
were
lost
to
his
view
behind
a
low
shrubbery
matters
must
take
their
own
course
now
it
is
too
late
to
recall
onwards
they
went
leaving
the
broad
walk
which
led
by
the
side
of
the
lawn
and
shrubberies
they
at
once
struck
across
the
park
down
one
of
the
noble
glades
of
from
whence
the
place
took
its
name
the
day
was
bright
and
of
those
blessed
days
of
june
when
all
nature
seems
to
put
forward
her
choicest
productions
for
the
gratification
and
admiration
of
cowslip
and
daisy
buttercup
and
wild
anemone
with
a
thousand
other
flowers
of
lowly
pretensions
yet
of
exquisite
beauty
have
opened
their
bright
blossoms
to
the
sunlight
and
are
wooing
it
in
silent
thankfulness
the
verdant
carpet
beneath
them
was
full
of
these
glowing
in
their
freshest
bloom
the
sheep
and
lambs
dotted
here
and
there
upon
every
slope
lazily
cropped
the
short
soft
herbage
and
the
tinkling
of
their
bells
and
the
faint
bleating
of
the
lambs
now
distant
now
near
mingled
with
the
hum
of
the
many
bees
which
busily
drew
their
loads
of
sweets
roaming
from
flower
to
flower
butterflies
of
many
hues
their
gorgeous
wings
glaring
in
the
bright
light
fluttered
swiftly
along
coquetting
as
it
were
with
the
flowers
and
enjoying
in
their
full
vigour
the
sunny
brightness
of
their
short
lives
there
was
no
wind
and
yet
a
freshness
in
the
air
which
tempered
the
heat
of
the
sun
the
with
their
shining
leaves
appeared
sleeping
in
the
sunlight
and
as
if
resting
during
the
short
period
there
might
be
allowed
them
from
their
almost
ceaseless
waving
far
around
them
the
park
stretched
away
into
broad
glades
some
ended
by
woods
others
presenting
peeps
of
blue
and
dim
distance
while
through
all
there
was
a
vapour
floating
sufficient
only
to
take
off
the
harshness
from
every
outline
whether
of
tree
or
distance
and
to
blend
the
whole
harmoniously
into
that
soft
dreamy
appearance
so
exquisite
and
so
soothing
to
behold
how
lovely
the
park
is
herbert
said
amy
is
it
not
every
step
we
take
seems
to
present
a
new
picture
which
ought
to
be
drawn
look
now
at
that
group
of
sheep
and
deer
almost
intermixed
the
deer
have
chosen
the
fern
which
is
partly
under
that
magnificent
beech
the
sheep
are
all
among
them
and
their
young
lambs
enjoying
their
merry
gambols
the
light
is
falling
in
that
beautiful
chequered
manner
which
i
strive
in
vain
to
represent
and
yet
how
great
are
the
masses
how
perfect
the
unstudied
composition
how
exquisite
the
colour
the
brightest
and
warmest
green
spangled
with
flowers
is
before
us
this
is
broken
by
the
shadows
beyond
the
tree
there
is
a
delicious
grey
melting
imperceptibly
into
the
most
tender
blue
is
it
not
a
picture
now
herbert
a
lovely
one
indeed
amy
a
study
worthy
of
berghem
or
cuyp
what
exquisite
perceptions
of
nature
must
they
have
had
their
pictures
and
those
of
many
of
the
same
class
how
simple
and
yet
painted
with
the
most
consummate
art
and
nicest
finish
scarcely
a
flower
escapes
them
yet
there
is
not
one
too
many
represented
nor
one
in
any
way
interfering
with
the
harmony
of
their
colouring
i
often
long
for
such
power
for
we
only
can
appreciate
their
skill
and
genius
by
our
own
awkward
attempts
to
imitate
them
indeed
when
i
look
on
the
works
of
any
of
these
great
masters
my
own
appear
so
contemptible
in
my
eyes
that
i
am
tempted
to
forswear
the
gentle
craft
indeed
you
are
to
do
no
such
thing
herbert
but
help
me
to
sketch
and
to
blunder
on
through
many
a
drawing
yet
i
have
no
idea
of
being
put
out
of
conceit
of
my
own
performances
for
which
i
have
a
high
respect
i
assure
you
but
come
if
we
stay
loitering
by
every
old
and
group
of
sheep
or
deer
i
shall
get
no
sketch
done
in
time
for
you
to
copy
on
my
drawing
and
shall
be
obliged
perhaps
to
listen
to
some
terrible
excuses
of
duty
or
business
so
come
we
have
yet
a
good
way
to
beguiling
the
way
little
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
by
gentle
converse
upon
familiar
yet
to
them
interesting
subjects
they
reached
the
busy
murmuring
river
stealing
quietly
under
a
bank
chafed
in
its
passage
over
a
few
stones
eddying
past
a
rock
and
covered
with
white
foam
widening
out
into
a
little
pool
partly
natural
partly
artificial
the
glassy
surface
of
which
was
broken
into
circles
by
the
rapid
rising
of
the
trout
which
eagerly
leaped
after
the
flies
that
sported
upon
it
there
was
a
small
pathway
beside
the
stream
which
had
been
the
work
of
all
the
boys
some
years
ago
in
some
places
it
wound
through
thickets
of
alder
and
hazel
which
met
above
it
forming
a
green
alcove
impervious
to
the
sun
again
under
some
mossy
bank
or
ash
where
a
rustic
seat
had
been
erected
further
as
it
advanced
it
led
round
a
projecting
bank
to
a
little
open
bay
surrounded
by
rocks
one
of
which
jutted
out
boldly
into
the
stream
that
brawled
noisily
past
it
and
the
open
space
once
a
level
spot
of
greensward
had
been
laid
out
irregularly
in
a
little
garden
which
now
bloomed
with
many
sweet
and
beautiful
flowers
of
kinds
despised
perhaps
nowadays
but
not
the
less
lovely
for
all
that
tall
hollyhocks
there
were
and
roses
and
honeysuckles
had
been
trained
up
against
the
rocks
with
jessamine
clematis
and
other
creepers
which
poured
forth
their
fragrance
on
the
air
many
a
time
had
the
little
circles
of
beechwood
and
alston
united
here
and
many
a
joyous
and
dance
had
occupied
hours
which
could
never
be
forgotten
by
any
it
was
a
lovely
spot
indeed
the
rocky
bank
around
the
little
circle
was
as
we
have
said
covered
with
creepers
festoons
of
ivy
hung
from
above
and
over
all
nodded
some
ash
or
other
mingled
with
underwood
and
fern
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
worn
away
by
the
water
which
had
run
past
it
for
countless
years
the
bank
was
high
and
steep
covered
with
ivy
and
drooping
fern
all
sorts
of
little
peering
wild
flowers
lurked
among
its
recesses
with
mosses
whose
colours
glistened
like
emerald
and
gold
above
it
grew
two
or
three
noble
ashes
and
beeches
whose
feathery
foliage
descended
in
minute
and
graceful
sprays
down
to
the
bank
and
waved
with
every
breath
of
wind
a
tiny
or
hermitage
as
they
had
called
it
made
of
and
thatched
with
heath
stood
in
the
corner
formed
by
the
projection
round
which
they
were
passing
and
thither
they
directed
their
steps
for
it
commanded
a
view
of
the
whole
of
the
little
amphitheatre
the
rock
the
river
and
the
bank
beyond
though
there
was
a
kind
of
garden
yet
there
was
nothing
artificial
in
its
appearance
the
few
flowers
looked
almost
like
the
spontaneous
growth
of
the
spot
and
did
not
interfere
with
the
perfectly
wild
yet
beautiful
character
of
the
scene
which
otherwise
was
as
nature
in
one
of
her
bountiful
moods
had
fashioned
and
left
it
nook
wherein
man
might
worship
her
the
more
devoutly
the
whole
glowed
under
the
bright
beams
of
the
noonday
sun
and
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
to
disturb
the
complete
serenity
and
dreamy
effect
of
the
place
now
sit
down
here
herbert
said
amy
and
begin
yonder
by
that
ivy
you
are
to
draw
me
all
the
jutting
rock
the
water
eddying
round
it
the
reeds
here
by
the
brink
and
give
me
a
bit
of
distance
beyond
and
i
do
not
think
she
added
with
enthusiasm
that
the
world
could
show
a
lovelier
spot
than
our
little
hermitage
i
only
wish
i
could
grasp
it
all
and
put
it
upon
my
paper
as
i
see
it
do
not
you
often
feel
so
indeed
i
do
amy
and
am
vexed
at
my
own
clumsy
attempts
to
imitate
nature
but
i
will
do
my
best
for
you
i
may
not
soon
again
have
such
an
opportunity
you
mean
there
will
not
be
such
another
delicious
day
herbert
but
i
do
not
despair
now
of
the
herbert
was
silent
he
had
thought
his
remark
might
have
led
to
the
subject
he
did
not
know
how
to
break
he
looked
at
his
companion
and
he
felt
how
hard
it
would
be
to
leave
one
so
beautiful
nay
so
loved
as
she
was
he
had
never
spoken
to
her
of
love
but
now
the
hour
approached
when
he
was
to
leave
her
and
there
were
feelings
within
him
struggling
for
expression
which
he
could
ill
restrain
his
thoughts
oppressed
him
and
though
he
continued
to
sketch
he
was
silent
you
are
very
dull
and
absent
herbert
she
said
at
length
as
she
continued
looking
over
his
shoulder
but
you
are
drawing
that
foliage
and
the
old
rock
very
nicely
so
i
must
not
scold
you
and
again
she
continued
to
converse
she
tried
many
topics
she
spoke
eloquently
and
feelingly
of
her
boundless
love
of
nature
she
told
him
what
she
had
been
reading
asked
him
a
thousand
questions
about
his
duties
his
regiment
his
companions
of
which
he
answered
mechanically
for
his
heart
was
too
busy
for
him
to
heed
the
replies
his
tongue
gave
upon
my
word
i
do
not
know
what
to
make
of
you
herbert
she
cried
laughing
as
he
had
given
some
absurd
reply
to
one
of
her
questions
or
sallies
which
was
not
in
any
way
relative
to
it
you
draw
most
meritoriously
and
better
than
ever
i
saw
you
before
but
my
words
fall
on
heedless
ears
for
i
am
sure
you
have
neither
heard
nor
understood
a
word
of
what
i
have
been
saying
this
hour
past
now
make
haste
few
touches
will
finish
that
and
you
can
add
figures
afterwards
if
you
like
i
am
sure
you
are
unwell
if
you
are
so
i
insist
on
your
giving
up
the
i
shall
never
again
have
such
an
opportunity
dear
amy
he
said
not
at
least
for
a
long
time
so
i
had
better
do
all
i
can
there
was
much
sadness
in
his
tone
what
do
you
mean
by
that
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
heard
you
say
it
she
replied
anxiously
you
surely
can
not
be
going
to
leave
us
again
the
regiment
has
only
been
here
two
months
me
i
beseech
you
herbert
she
continued
as
he
looked
up
from
the
drawing
and
distress
was
very
visible
upon
his
countenance
tell
me
what
you
have
to
say
why
do
you
look
so
sad
because
dear
amy
i
have
news
which
will
pain
you
is
i
think
it
will
we
have
ever
been
so
linked
together
you
have
guessed
the
truth
am
indeed
to
leave
that
so
soon
that
my
own
brain
is
confused
by
the
sudden
orders
we
have
she
turned
as
pale
as
death
and
her
lips
quivered
all
the
misery
and
danger
she
had
ever
heard
of
foreign
service
rushed
at
once
overwhelmingly
into
her
thoughts
she
tried
to
speak
but
could
not
it
must
be
told
sooner
or
later
he
thought
laying
down
the
sketch
and
drawing
towards
her
he
continued
though
with
much
difficulty
in
preserving
his
composure
the
regiment
is
ordered
upon
service
amy
and
after
many
thoughts
i
find
i
have
no
alternative
but
to
accompany
it
we
march
for
dover
in
a
few
days
the
transports
we
hear
will
meet
us
there
and
after
we
have
embarked
the
convoy
fleet
for
india
will
join
us
at
portsmouth
or
for
india
were
the
only
words
the
poor
girl
could
utter
as
she
sunk
helpless
and
fainting
upon
the
seat
chapter
x
amy
dear
amy
cried
the
young
man
agonised
by
her
bitter
sobs
which
ceased
not
though
he
had
raised
her
up
and
supporting
her
form
strove
to
console
her
but
in
vain
amy
speak
to
me
one
word
only
one
word
and
you
will
be
better
call
me
by
my
do
not
look
so
utterly
wretched
nor
sob
so
bitterly
god
knows
i
have
enough
to
bear
in
leaving
you
so
suddenly
but
this
misery
is
worst
of
all
dear
amy
look
up
say
that
you
will
try
to
conquer
this
and
i
shall
have
the
less
to
reproach
myself
with
for
having
told
you
of
so
but
she
spoke
not
she
could
not
utter
one
word
for
the
choking
sensation
in
her
throat
she
passed
her
hand
over
it
often
tried
in
vain
to
swallow
and
gasped
in
the
attempt
good
god
you
are
ill
exclaimed
herbert
hurriedly
what
can
be
done
what
can
i
get
my
own
amy
dearest
not
look
but
his
entreaties
were
of
no
avail
against
her
overpowering
grief
she
had
struggled
with
the
hysterical
feeling
till
she
could
no
longer
oppose
it
and
yielded
to
its
influence
distracted
herbert
knew
not
what
to
do
aid
there
was
none
nearer
than
the
house
and
he
could
not
leave
dared
not
he
raised
her
gently
and
bore
her
like
a
child
to
the
river
s
brink
he
unloosed
her
bonnet
and
sprinkled
water
on
her
face
it
revived
her
and
after
some
time
and
difficulty
he
succeeded
in
making
her
drink
a
little
from
his
closed
hands
she
recovered
gradually
but
lay
sobbing
still
bitterly
upon
the
grass
weakened
and
exhausted
by
the
violence
of
her
emotions
herbert
continued
to
hang
over
her
in
the
greatest
anxiety
and
to
implore
her
to
speak
in
the
tenderest
epithets
he
had
not
discovered
how
dear
she
was
to
him
till
he
had
heard
his
fate
and
he
had
tried
to
argue
himself
out
of
the
belief
but
without
avail
his
high
sense
of
honour
then
came
to
his
aid
and
he
thought
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
declare
such
feelings
to
her
when
he
might
never
return
and
fervently
as
he
loved
her
he
could
have
spared
her
the
bitterness
of
that
lingering
hope
which
is
so
akin
to
despair
but
in
those
moments
he
had
forgotten
all
thoughts
of
the
past
and
for
the
future
all
centred
in
intense
affection
for
the
helpless
being
before
him
whose
artless
mind
had
not
attempted
any
disguise
of
her
devoted
love
for
her
companion
of
so
many
years
at
last
she
recovered
sufficiently
to
raise
herself
up
and
this
the
first
sign
of
consciousness
she
had
given
was
rapture
to
herbert
he
bent
down
to
her
and
attempted
to
lift
her
to
her
feet
she
was
passive
in
his
hands
even
as
a
weak
child
and
partly
supporting
partly
carrying
her
he
led
her
to
the
hermitage
there
he
seated
her
on
the
rustic
bench
and
kneeling
down
beside
her
while
one
arm
was
passed
round
her
she
could
not
have
sat
alone
without
support
poured
forth
with
the
impetuosity
and
tenderness
of
his
disposition
his
vows
of
love
and
his
entreaties
for
some
token
that
he
had
not
angered
her
by
his
abruptness
but
one
word
my
amy
but
one
word
dearest
word
that
in
those
far
distant
lands
i
may
feed
on
it
in
my
heart
while
your
beautiful
face
is
present
to
my
imagination
dearest
we
have
loved
each
other
with
more
than
children
s
love
from
infancy
we
have
never
expressed
it
but
now
the
trial
has
come
and
you
will
not
be
the
one
to
deny
yours
at
such
a
time
o
amy
speak
to
me
one
word
to
assure
me
that
i
may
call
you
mine
for
ever
much
more
he
said
and
more
passionately
but
her
hand
was
not
withdrawn
from
his
nor
did
she
remove
herself
from
him
a
tear
at
last
forced
its
way
from
her
closed
eyelids
for
she
dared
not
to
open
them
soon
others
followed
they
fell
hot
and
fast
upon
his
hand
for
a
little
while
and
at
length
as
she
strove
to
speak
but
could
not
she
was
no
longer
able
to
control
her
emotion
and
she
fell
upon
his
neck
and
wept
aloud
the
young
man
strained
her
to
his
heart
and
as
he
wiped
the
tears
from
her
eyes
he
poured
such
consolation
as
he
could
find
words
to
utter
into
her
perturbed
heart
she
did
not
question
his
love
had
no
doubt
of
that
but
there
was
one
which
even
her
light
and
joyous
spirit
quailed
and
while
it
caused
her
to
shiver
in
very
apprehension
of
perils
which
her
thoughts
could
not
define
she
clung
the
closer
to
him
and
strove
to
shut
out
the
evils
with
which
her
mental
visions
were
overcast
the
trying
test
of
coming
absence
of
dangers
to
be
braved
hardships
to
be
endured
had
at
once
broken
down
all
barriers
of
formality
and
opened
to
them
the
state
of
each
other
s
affections
in
that
perfect
confidence
that
pure
reliance
gentle
growth
of
years
it
is
true
which
had
at
once
expanded
without
a
check
and
would
endure
for
ever
who
can
tell
the
exquisite
pleasure
of
such
a
first
embrace
pure
love
such
as
theirs
had
little
of
the
dross
of
passion
in
it
the
knowledge
that
years
must
elapse
ere
they
could
meet
again
the
silent
dread
that
it
might
never
be
put
a
thought
of
possession
far
from
them
and
in
the
perfect
purity
and
ecstasy
of
feeling
of
those
moments
the
indulgence
of
thoughts
new
yet
so
inexpressibly
sweet
to
them
is
no
wonder
in
that
sequestered
and
lovely
spot
that
hours
should
have
passed
and
time
should
have
been
unheeded
nor
was
it
until
the
lengthened
shadows
warned
them
of
the
decline
of
the
day
that
they
could
speak
of
parting
or
of
the
object
of
their
visit
the
sketch
had
lain
on
the
ground
unheeded
amy
took
it
up
it
will
be
to
me
the
silent
witness
of
what
has
this
day
happened
she
said
and
the
dearest
treasure
i
possess
herbert
when
you
are
gone
from
me
now
one
little
favour
i
beg
that
you
will
sketch
in
ourselves
as
i
lay
fainting
on
the
bank
yonder
and
you
as
you
bent
over
me
for
i
think
it
was
there
and
then
i
first
heard
you
say
you
loved
me
herbert
to
me
it
will
be
a
comfort
and
a
solace
till
you
return
and
then
we
will
come
here
together
and
you
shall
see
that
not
a
shrub
or
flower
has
been
altered
four
years
you
said
dearest
they
will
soon
pass
and
i
confess
i
have
hope
beyond
what
i
thought
i
should
ever
have
possessed
four
years
methinks
in
anticipation
they
are
already
gone
and
we
sit
here
a
bronzed
soldier
with
a
thousand
tales
for
me
to
hear
and
i
will
sit
at
your
feet
and
listen
your
unchanged
and
unchangeable
herbert
regarded
her
with
intense
admiration
for
her
sadness
had
passed
away
and
though
tears
trembled
in
her
bright
eyes
with
every
word
she
spoke
there
was
a
joyous
tone
in
her
voice
and
in
her
expression
and
his
spirit
caught
that
hope
from
hers
which
under
other
circumstances
would
have
been
denied
him
willingly
most
willingly
dearest
he
said
taking
the
drawing
from
her
and
in
a
few
moments
he
had
sketched
in
the
figures
raising
herself
up
had
recovered
consciousness
and
he
bending
anxiously
over
her
had
implored
her
to
speak
to
him
there
was
such
force
and
tenderness
in
the
attitudes
that
it
told
the
simple
story
at
a
glance
it
is
too
plain
herbert
she
said
half
reproachfully
i
shall
not
dare
to
show
any
one
your
boldest
and
by
far
most
beautiful
sketch
nay
you
are
even
making
a
likeness
of
me
which
is
too
bad
but
i
need
not
fear
for
no
one
shall
ever
see
it
but
myself
my
last
look
shall
be
of
it
at
night
and
with
that
my
last
thought
shall
be
with
you
now
that
is
enough
i
will
not
have
another
touch
lest
you
spoil
it
give
it
me
let
me
carry
it
home
and
lock
it
up
from
every
one
but
you
may
have
it
if
you
will
dearest
but
i
must
beg
it
for
at
least
i
will
make
a
small
sketch
from
it
and
will
bring
it
over
early
it
is
only
upon
your
promise
not
to
keep
it
longer
than
morning
that
you
may
have
it
herbert
i
am
nearly
inclined
to
make
you
stay
at
beechwood
to
copy
it
lest
anything
should
befall
it
but
i
am
not
selfish
enough
to
detain
you
from
those
who
love
you
as
dearly
as
i
slowly
they
retraced
their
steps
through
every
bowery
path
and
open
glade
the
blossoms
of
the
lime
and
filled
the
air
with
luscious
sweetness
and
their
broad
shadows
were
flung
wide
over
the
sward
they
wandered
on
hardly
heeding
the
luxuriant
beauty
of
the
landscape
with
their
arms
twined
round
each
other
while
they
spoke
in
those
gentle
murmuring
tones
which
though
low
were
yet
distinct
and
of
which
every
word
was
striven
to
be
remembered
for
years
afterwards
my
father
must
know
all
said
amy
as
they
approached
the
house
we
have
nothing
to
fear
from
him
and
therefore
nothing
to
conceal
but
i
dare
not
speak
herbert
i
do
not
flinch
from
the
trial
dearest
was
his
reply
if
you
can
bear
it
i
would
rather
you
were
present
no
no
no
i
could
not
bear
it
herbert
replied
the
blushing
girl
and
i
had
better
not
be
present
i
know
for
we
should
both
lose
courage
no
you
must
tell
all
to
papa
and
leave
me
to
my
own
solitude
for
a
while
for
indeed
i
require
it
and
now
here
we
are
at
home
i
need
not
you
know
papa
as
well
as
i
nothing
for
we
have
nothing
to
she
ran
lightly
on
through
the
hall
and
up
the
broad
staircase
herbert
followed
her
beautiful
figure
till
he
could
see
it
no
longer
then
listened
till
he
heard
the
door
of
her
chamber
close
after
her
she
has
gone
to
pray
for
herself
and
me
he
thought
and
thought
truly
the
was
before
him
his
heart
beat
very
fast
and
his
hand
almost
trembled
as
he
placed
it
upon
the
handle
but
his
resolution
was
made
in
an
instant
and
he
passed
in
hayward
laid
down
the
book
he
had
been
reading
and
took
the
spectacles
from
his
nose
as
herbert
entered
you
are
a
pretty
pair
of
truants
he
said
cheerfully
an
hour
or
two
indeed
why
tis
just
six
o
clock
and
where
is
amy
she
is
gone
to
her
room
sir
for
a
short
time
she
said
she
would
not
be
long
and
what
have
you
been
about
come
let
me
see
you
know
i
am
a
great
admirer
of
your
spirited
sketches
herbert
so
hand
me
your
day
s
work
which
ought
to
be
an
elaborate
affair
considering
the
time
you
have
been
about
and
he
replaced
his
spectacles
herbert
blushed
crimson
he
felt
his
face
glowing
painfully
he
had
forgotten
the
roll
of
paper
which
he
had
kept
in
his
hand
and
he
could
not
deny
that
it
was
the
sketch
hayward
wished
to
see
he
hesitated
a
little
grew
somewhat
indecisive
in
his
speech
and
as
the
old
gentlemen
was
beginning
to
suspect
the
truth
herbert
had
told
all
and
stood
before
him
glowing
with
manly
emotion
and
proud
feelings
of
rectitude
there
was
nothing
to
conceal
amy
had
said
so
he
concealed
nothing
he
told
him
how
he
had
intended
not
to
have
spoken
to
her
but
how
overcome
by
the
anguish
of
seeing
her
so
prostrated
by
grief
he
had
revealed
to
her
all
his
feelings
even
at
the
risk
of
her
displeasure
amy
loves
me
sir
he
continued
proudly
nor
does
she
seek
to
deny
it
we
have
too
long
shared
each
other
s
thoughts
for
any
reserve
to
exist
between
us
and
to
you
we
fearlessly
commit
ourselves
in
frank
confession
of
our
fault
if
we
have
committed
hayward
only
mused
for
a
moment
he
loved
herbert
too
well
and
had
known
him
too
long
to
hesitate
may
god
bless
you
both
my
dear
boy
he
cried
rising
from
his
chair
and
extending
his
arms
to
embrace
the
young
man
may
god
bless
you
if
there
had
not
been
this
dreadful
absence
to
contemplate
i
should
have
counted
this
one
of
the
happiest
moments
of
my
life
as
it
is
i
am
thankful
that
amy
is
loved
by
such
an
one
as
you
herbert
but
where
is
she
i
can
remain
no
longer
without
seeing
you
he
rang
the
bell
tell
miss
hayward
that
i
want
her
here
as
soon
as
possible
said
the
old
gentleman
to
the
servant
a
few
minutes
only
elapsed
during
which
neither
spoke
at
last
her
light
footstep
was
heard
on
the
stairs
descending
slowly
it
passed
over
the
hall
so
lightly
that
even
herbert
s
ear
could
hardly
detect
it
he
fancied
it
hesitated
at
the
door
and
he
flew
to
open
it
and
the
smile
of
joy
of
triumph
which
met
her
hurried
glance
served
in
some
measure
to
assure
her
her
father
stood
with
open
arms
and
lips
quivering
with
emotion
god
bless
you
god
bless
you
was
all
he
could
utter
as
she
rushed
into
them
and
sobbing
hid
her
burning
face
in
his
bosom
nor
did
she
venture
to
withdraw
it
for
long
nor
he
to
disturb
her
the
gush
of
joy
which
welled
from
his
heart
as
he
strained
her
to
it
was
too
pure
to
relinquish
easily
if
i
have
been
wrong
dear
father
forgive
me
was
all
she
was
able
to
utter
after
a
silence
of
some
moments
nay
i
have
nothing
to
forgive
my
sweet
pet
he
said
i
had
looked
for
this
happiness
only
as
a
consummation
of
my
dearest
wishes
and
it
is
now
as
unexpected
as
grateful
but
i
will
keep
you
no
longer
herbert
he
said
to
him
nor
must
amy
either
for
there
are
others
who
have
stronger
claims
upon
you
than
we
have
and
i
dare
not
detain
you
from
them
i
wish
however
and
amy
will
second
the
wish
i
know
that
you
would
come
over
as
early
as
you
can
and
give
us
a
quiet
day
and
evening
together
it
will
be
as
much
a
source
of
gratification
to
you
to
dwell
on
when
you
are
away
as
it
will
be
to
us
so
say
will
you
come
at
any
time
the
invitation
would
have
been
welcome
but
now
the
imploring
looks
of
the
fair
girl
were
arguments
which
could
not
be
resisted
i
will
be
with
you
as
early
as
i
can
herbert
replied
as
soon
as
i
can
complete
a
task
i
have
here
and
i
will
not
leave
you
till
night
so
for
the
present
farewell
and
i
beg
you
to
procure
me
the
forgiveness
and
i
will
add
the
blessing
of
her
whom
i
hope
to
call
a
second
you
need
have
no
doubts
said
hayward
you
have
nothing
to
apprehend
but
on
the
contrary
i
can
assure
you
that
this
subject
will
be
one
of
great
delight
to
her
so
once
more
god
bless
you
amy
followed
him
to
the
apparently
to
shut
it
after
him
but
she
passed
out
with
him
after
a
moment
s
coquetting
with
the
handle
you
will
not
fail
dear
herbert
i
could
not
bear
disappointment
now
she
said
to
him
her
eyes
filling
and
sparkling
like
violets
with
hanging
in
them
nor
for
worlds
would
i
give
you
one
moment
s
pain
dearest
fear
not
i
shall
be
with
you
soon
after
noon
and
god
bless
you
perhaps
it
was
that
they
had
approached
very
nigh
each
other
as
they
spoke
and
he
could
not
resist
the
tempting
opportunity
or
perhaps
it
is
of
no
use
to
speculate
it
is
that
he
drew
her
to
him
gently
and
imprinted
one
fervent
kiss
on
her
lips
she
did
not
chide
him
but
felt
the
more
cheerful
afterwards
that
she
had
received
it
herbert
hurried
home
and
instantly
sought
his
parents
he
told
them
all
nor
concealed
from
them
one
thought
by
which
he
had
been
actuated
nor
one
struggle
against
his
love
which
he
had
failed
to
overcome
they
were
both
much
affected
for
indeed
it
was
a
solemn
thing
to
contemplate
the
plighting
of
their
son
s
faith
with
amy
on
the
eve
of
such
a
separation
yet
they
were
gratified
and
in
their
prayers
that
night
and
ever
afterwards
they
commended
the
beloved
pair
to
the
guardianship
and
protection
of
him
whom
they
worshipped
in
spirit
and
in
truth
chapter
xi
the
morrow
bright
and
joyous
day
on
which
the
spirit
of
beauty
and
of
love
revelled
in
every
natural
creation
and
was
abroad
over
the
whole
earth
day
of
dreamy
voluptuous
repose
when
one
feels
only
fitted
to
hold
silent
converse
with
nature
in
intense
admiration
of
the
glorious
perfection
of
her
works
the
sun
was
almost
overpoweringly
bright
and
the
world
abroad
rejoiced
in
his
beams
man
everywhere
should
have
rejoiced
too
yet
there
were
some
hearts
which
his
effulgence
could
not
illumine
which
his
cheering
influence
could
not
enliven
the
at
the
rectory
was
a
silent
one
where
heretofore
all
had
been
joyous
and
cheerful
for
it
was
useless
to
struggle
against
the
grief
which
pervaded
the
whole
family
compton
and
herbert
strove
the
most
manfully
and
with
best
success
to
cheer
the
rest
and
themselves
but
compton
dared
not
look
at
any
one
and
she
sat
silently
with
quivering
lips
and
eyes
filled
with
tears
of
which
she
was
unconscious
except
as
those
drops
starting
from
the
pure
fountain
of
a
mother
s
love
ran
down
upon
her
cheek
and
were
hastily
brushed
away
her
eyes
were
now
fixed
upon
vacancy
and
again
wandered
to
her
son
and
were
withdrawn
only
when
it
became
agony
to
repress
the
emotion
she
felt
who
can
fathom
the
depth
of
a
mother
s
love
for
such
a
son
one
on
whom
she
had
doated
even
to
weakness
from
his
birth
we
dare
not
attempt
to
depict
it
nor
can
it
be
expressed
but
it
has
been
felt
by
millions
and
will
continue
to
be
so
while
the
tenderest
and
holiest
feelings
of
love
are
continued
as
blessings
to
us
herbert
fulfilled
his
appointment
faithfully
ere
he
had
passed
the
little
bridge
many
paces
the
maiden
met
him
for
she
had
long
sat
and
watched
for
him
and
they
strolled
on
away
through
the
most
sequestered
glades
of
the
park
resting
at
whiles
on
hillocks
of
thyme
and
mossy
banks
which
courted
occupation
as
they
wandered
by
time
flew
lightly
and
in
that
perfect
bliss
which
can
be
only
known
once
pure
are
the
sensations
that
the
heart
does
not
hope
to
feel
them
again
and
which
if
once
enjoyed
remain
indelibly
impressed
upon
it
for
ever
they
wandered
on
they
had
no
thought
for
anything
around
them
no
eyes
to
behold
beauties
except
in
the
luxury
of
their
own
thoughts
their
minds
were
like
stringed
instruments
in
perfect
unison
touch
by
the
one
was
responded
to
by
the
other
with
harmony
they
spoke
of
the
future
with
confidence
with
that
pure
hope
only
known
to
the
young
who
have
never
felt
the
agony
of
hope
deferred
there
was
no
cloud
now
over
their
bright
future
four
years
to
look
back
on
it
was
nothing
they
could
remember
the
occurrences
of
four
years
ago
as
though
they
were
yesterday
and
those
to
come
they
thought
would
pass
as
fast
he
spoke
to
her
of
the
gorgeous
east
of
the
temples
the
palaces
the
almost
he
was
to
see
and
they
pictured
to
themselves
a
land
so
bright
and
fair
that
they
longed
to
roam
over
it
in
company
he
promised
her
letters
cold
formal
ones
written
at
a
sitting
but
daily
records
of
his
thoughts
and
minute
descriptions
of
the
varied
scenes
he
should
pass
through
he
promised
sketches
too
by
every
opportunity
of
everything
about
him
his
tent
his
room
even
of
his
table
where
he
should
sit
and
hold
conversations
with
her
in
writing
as
well
as
of
the
scenery
and
magnificent
remains
of
the
country
and
in
this
exquisite
converse
all
care
for
the
time
had
passed
away
from
them
for
though
the
feeling
of
parting
did
often
float
through
their
minds
yet
it
would
have
been
hard
had
it
been
allowed
to
damp
the
buoyancy
of
two
such
naturally
cheerful
hearts
as
theirs
and
they
entered
the
of
beechwood
together
glowing
with
such
pleasure
and
with
such
joyous
expressions
upon
their
faces
that
hayward
who
had
been
long
waiting
for
them
and
had
expected
a
far
different
scene
was
affected
with
joy
instead
of
sorrow
and
though
the
result
was
much
the
same
yet
her
equanimity
was
soon
restored
and
the
hearty
blessing
and
greeting
she
gave
the
pair
as
they
advanced
to
receive
it
gratified
her
benevolent
and
loving
heart
herbert
stayed
with
them
till
the
night
was
far
spent
there
was
perfect
confidence
and
perfect
love
among
the
party
and
if
these
are
seldom
vouchsafed
together
in
life
s
pilgrimage
they
make
the
period
of
that
intercourse
so
marked
in
its
purity
of
character
that
it
is
the
better
appreciated
and
the
longer
remembered
but
sadness
came
at
length
dreaded
day
of
departure
drew
nigh
sabbath
herbert
s
last
day
with
his
parents
was
held
sacred
by
both
families
and
as
they
now
had
a
common
interest
in
him
who
was
about
to
leave
they
passed
it
together
at
the
rectory
there
is
little
pleasure
in
dwelling
upon
a
scene
so
sad
depicting
the
sorrow
of
those
who
were
assembled
and
hayward
did
the
utmost
their
kind
hearts
could
suggest
to
comfort
their
friends
and
in
some
measure
succeeded
but
the
time
passed
heavily
the
conversation
however
it
was
directed
only
tended
to
the
same
point
that
was
too
painful
a
one
to
be
discussed
freely
and
was
only
alluded
to
with
difficulty
compton
tried
in
vain
to
sit
out
the
evening
in
the
and
at
length
was
obliged
to
retire
to
her
own
chamber
where
she
was
followed
and
tended
by
her
friend
and
amy
with
true
affection
poor
amy
she
had
a
hard
part
to
bear
to
conceal
her
own
miserable
feelings
in
order
that
she
might
not
be
an
additional
weight
upon
the
already
oppressed
spirits
of
others
was
a
task
she
was
barely
equal
to
yet
she
strove
well
to
master
her
grief
and
to
all
appearance
hers
was
the
only
light
heart
of
the
party
herbert
had
promised
to
accompany
her
home
through
the
park
so
that
she
would
be
spared
the
misery
of
bidding
him
farewell
before
others
even
though
they
might
be
her
own
parents
and
this
also
consoled
her
in
their
evening
worship
compton
took
occasion
to
allude
to
herbert
s
departure
his
prayer
was
beautiful
and
simple
and
in
fervent
supplication
he
earnestly
commended
him
to
the
almighty
s
care
and
protection
the
bitter
sobs
of
compton
could
throughout
be
heard
above
his
own
tremulous
voice
but
he
persevered
manfully
and
all
of
that
assembly
arose
more
calm
and
more
reconciled
to
what
was
now
inevitable
hayward
s
carriage
was
soon
afterwards
at
the
door
it
was
announced
in
the
and
he
and
hayward
arose
to
depart
they
were
both
deeply
affected
as
may
well
be
imagined
herbert
was
so
too
and
spoke
with
difficulty
but
they
blessed
him
and
gave
him
their
fervent
wishes
for
success
and
a
safe
return
within
the
time
he
had
appointed
as
warmly
as
if
he
had
been
one
of
their
own
children
i
have
only
one
last
favour
to
beg
dear
hayward
he
said
as
he
handed
her
into
the
carriage
that
you
will
allow
amy
to
walk
home
under
my
escort
i
shall
feel
very
thankful
if
you
will
i
will
not
refuse
you
herbert
she
said
be
gentle
to
her
for
she
loves
you
very
deeply
never
disappoint
her
in
writing
for
i
am
well
convinced
your
letters
will
be
her
life
while
you
are
away
i
will
endeavour
to
make
every
allowance
for
the
delay
which
needs
must
occur
in
the
transmission
of
letters
from
such
a
distance
but
still
you
must
be
punctual
and
regular
remember
these
are
my
last
and
only
commands
upon
you
take
amy
with
you
now
but
do
not
keep
her
out
late
for
the
dews
are
heavy
and
may
hurt
you
both
now
god
bless
you
my
letters
shall
be
my
best
answers
to
your
commands
said
herbert
believe
me
i
shall
not
miss
a
single
opportunity
of
sending
many
to
you
all
for
you
will
never
be
absent
from
my
thoughts
the
time
will
soon
pass
and
i
hope
and
trust
we
shall
all
again
be
reunited
in
this
dear
then
mrs
hayward
says
i
may
escort
amy
home
through
the
park
sir
said
herbert
to
hayward
who
was
following
we
shall
hardly
lose
our
way
in
this
beautiful
moonlight
and
i
hope
you
have
no
objection
not
if
you
promise
you
will
not
be
late
herbert
but
i
leave
her
to
your
own
discretion
i
have
not
the
heart
to
part
you
so
farewell
my
brave
boy
i
trust
we
shall
see
you
back
soon
a
colonel
at
least
you
will
not
forget
to
write
punctually
as
well
for
our
sake
as
for
amy
i
have
already
promised
hayward
that
said
herbert
and
most
faithfully
will
i
fulfil
then
i
will
say
no
more
but
again
farewell
and
god
bless
you
he
wrung
herbert
s
hand
warmly
and
with
cordial
sincerity
and
stepping
into
the
carriage
it
drove
rapidly
away
now
dearest
said
herbert
at
least
we
can
have
a
few
moments
which
we
can
call
our
to
be
the
food
of
years
when
every
word
however
trivial
that
one
has
uttered
will
be
to
the
other
the
most
precious
in
the
stock
of
our
hearts
remembrances
come
let
us
stroll
gently
she
took
his
arm
and
they
wandered
onwards
towards
the
park
the
moon
was
nigh
the
full
and
her
bright
orb
shed
a
mellow
light
on
all
around
a
few
fleecy
clouds
floated
near
her
in
the
deep
blue
heaven
but
not
enough
to
dim
her
lustre
and
her
beams
illuminated
while
they
softened
every
object
in
the
pathway
the
perfect
silence
which
reigned
around
them
only
broken
at
intervals
by
the
faint
tinkling
of
the
sheep
bells
here
and
there
or
the
feeble
bleat
of
a
lamb
was
soothing
to
them
and
the
wide
glades
of
the
park
seen
dimly
in
the
distance
appeared
to
melt
away
into
air
more
like
the
momentary
visions
of
dreams
than
the
realities
they
had
been
accustomed
to
for
years
they
had
much
to
say
to
each
other
for
they
were
young
ardent
with
the
intenseness
of
a
first
and
sincere
attachment
the
gentle
growth
of
years
yet
theirs
was
not
the
language
of
passion
but
those
sobered
chastened
and
now
sorrowful
feelings
which
were
the
result
at
once
of
their
long
attachment
and
their
dread
of
parting
and
they
lingered
on
nor
knew
how
swiftly
time
was
flying
and
that
their
sad
farewell
must
be
spoken
at
last
they
walked
up
to
the
house
several
times
and
thought
to
leave
each
other
but
always
some
new
word
was
spoken
some
train
of
thought
aroused
which
carried
them
away
again
forgetful
of
their
promises
not
to
delay
nor
could
amy
s
buoyant
heart
support
her
to
the
last
as
it
had
done
through
the
day
through
the
last
few
days
bitter
were
her
sobs
as
she
clung
to
the
manly
form
of
him
she
loved
and
more
violent
as
the
clock
of
the
struck
an
did
not
could
not
count
it
seemed
to
be
a
last
warning
to
her
to
leave
him
she
almost
longed
to
do
so
and
yet
had
not
the
power
nor
could
herbert
bring
himself
to
utter
the
wish
for
her
to
go
they
stood
before
the
irresolute
as
the
clock
struck
and
gently
in
as
soothing
words
as
he
could
frame
his
thoughts
to
utterance
he
reminded
her
of
his
promise
to
her
mother
and
of
her
strict
injunctions
it
was
only
from
my
promise
that
we
have
enjoyed
these
exquisite
moments
he
said
and
i
would
not
vex
her
but
still
they
lingered
she
was
helpless
as
a
child
her
tears
fell
very
fast
and
convulsive
sobs
shook
her
sadly
herbert
supported
her
with
one
arm
while
he
wiped
away
her
tears
and
kissed
the
beautiful
face
which
upturned
to
his
had
lost
its
cheerful
expression
and
now
wore
one
of
such
mental
anguish
as
had
never
before
visited
it
that
he
almost
reproached
himself
for
having
caused
it
it
required
all
his
to
restrain
a
violent
outbreak
of
passionate
emotion
for
his
heart
was
full
even
to
bursting
and
could
he
have
shed
tears
he
thought
it
would
have
relieved
him
but
they
were
denied
him
they
could
speak
but
little
all
he
could
utter
were
words
of
consolation
which
repeated
again
and
again
almost
unintelligibly
fell
on
heedless
ears
for
the
misery
of
her
mind
repelled
them
but
it
could
not
last
sooner
or
later
he
must
leave
her
and
he
felt
that
every
moment
was
causing
her
additional
pain
while
no
immediate
alleviation
could
follow
he
drew
her
gently
towards
the
door
she
understood
his
meaning
and
acquiesced
by
making
no
resistance
they
ascended
the
steps
together
the
door
had
been
left
unfastened
on
purpose
to
receive
her
and
he
felt
this
delicate
mark
of
kindness
in
her
parents
deeply
it
seemed
even
to
comfort
amy
that
she
should
be
able
to
reach
her
chamber
unobserved
go
and
pray
for
me
as
you
pray
for
yourself
dearest
it
will
soothe
you
more
than
my
words
or
feeble
consolations
he
said
as
opening
the
door
he
led
her
within
it
soon
i
will
join
my
prayers
to
yours
and
ascending
together
to
him
who
is
alone
able
to
grant
them
they
will
bring
us
that
peace
which
indeed
passes
understanding
go
may
he
who
looks
down
from
yonder
bright
and
glorious
heaven
upon
us
bless
you
for
ever
my
angel
and
keep
you
in
safety
he
could
not
add
more
nor
did
she
dare
to
reply
though
some
indistinct
murmurs
escaped
her
he
clasped
her
to
his
heart
in
one
ardent
embrace
kissed
her
lips
in
passionate
fervour
and
then
disengaging
her
from
him
she
did
not
could
not
oppose
it
led
her
softly
within
the
hall
and
not
daring
to
hazard
a
second
glance
upon
her
he
gently
closed
the
door
and
with
an
almost
bursting
heart
rushed
from
the
house
he
did
not
go
far
thus
nature
who
will
not
be
denied
vent
for
such
bitter
feelings
as
his
were
and
which
had
been
so
long
and
so
ill
repressed
demanded
relief
and
overcome
by
emotion
his
temples
throbbing
as
though
they
would
burst
with
a
choking
sensation
in
his
throat
which
caused
him
to
breathe
with
difficulty
he
threw
himself
upon
a
rustic
seat
by
the
side
of
the
walk
for
awhile
the
agony
he
suffered
was
almost
insupportable
but
afterwards
a
passionate
burst
of
tears
which
he
could
not
check
or
repress
came
to
his
relief
he
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
sobbed
bitterly
for
many
minutes
but
he
arose
at
last
in
some
degree
soothed
by
the
effort
nature
had
made
to
relieve
the
sorrow
which
had
overpowered
him
herbert
left
his
home
the
next
morning
amidst
the
unrestrained
and
bitter
grief
of
all
all
his
mother
s
previous
resolutions
failed
her
for
a
while
she
refused
to
be
comforted
dread
that
he
was
going
from
her
for
ever
oppressed
her
with
a
weight
which
she
could
not
throw
off
by
the
most
strenuous
mental
exertions
compton
strove
to
console
her
and
herbert
was
as
cheerful
as
he
could
be
under
the
circumstances
but
it
was
all
of
no
use
deep
affection
would
find
its
vent
and
no
wonder
when
all
had
been
so
knit
together
in
the
ties
of
love
as
that
family
but
after
breakfast
which
they
had
vainly
tried
to
eat
and
the
viands
which
had
been
provided
remained
untasted
upon
the
table
the
carriage
was
announced
to
each
of
his
brothers
and
his
younger
sisters
herbert
bade
a
tender
farewell
promising
them
all
sorts
of
presents
and
drawings
from
eastern
climates
but
who
shall
paint
his
last
moments
with
his
dear
and
honoured
mother
it
would
be
profanation
of
such
feelings
to
attempt
their
can
be
felt
only
never
described
mute
with
sorrow
compton
could
not
speak
to
him
as
he
folded
her
in
a
last
embrace
and
as
he
tore
himself
away
from
her
and
hurried
to
the
carriage
she
tottered
to
the
window
and
supporting
herself
by
the
side
panel
with
eyes
dim
with
weeping
and
now
almost
blinded
by
her
tears
she
watched
him
as
long
as
sight
of
him
was
spared
her
she
saw
him
throw
himself
into
the
father
attending
him
to
door
orders
given
to
proceed
but
ere
the
postilion
could
urge
his
horses
forward
she
had
sunk
senseless
upon
the
ground
the
regiment
marched
that
day
towards
dover
where
his
father
joined
herbert
in
a
few
days
here
they
were
detained
only
as
long
as
was
sufficient
to
provide
the
requisite
necessaries
to
the
regiment
for
a
hot
climate
and
the
duties
of
furnishing
these
to
his
men
kept
herbert
continually
employed
he
had
some
idea
at
one
time
of
returning
home
even
for
a
day
or
two
but
the
remembrance
of
the
pangs
which
both
his
mother
and
amy
had
suffered
was
too
fresh
in
his
mind
to
allow
of
his
indulging
in
so
selfish
and
indeed
a
useless
gratification
he
had
his
father
with
him
whose
presence
was
not
only
a
solace
but
who
prevented
as
much
as
was
in
his
power
herbert
s
giving
way
to
the
grief
which
at
times
he
could
not
repress
and
which
endured
in
despite
of
him
at
length
the
day
arrived
for
the
embarkation
and
a
gallant
but
painful
sight
it
was
to
see
so
many
brave
fellows
leaving
their
native
land
their
homes
their
parents
children
and
other
perhaps
dearer
to
shed
their
blood
in
their
country
s
brave
the
perils
of
an
unknown
land
and
dangerous
climate
for
her
sake
yet
as
the
regiment
moved
towards
the
pier
from
the
barracks
in
open
column
headed
by
their
band
playing
the
most
lively
marches
to
which
the
firm
and
measured
tread
of
the
men
formed
a
noble
accompaniment
there
could
not
be
seen
a
sorrowful
face
among
the
whole
for
their
colours
were
unfurled
and
floated
proudly
to
the
breeze
and
as
each
man
s
eye
rested
upon
those
emblems
of
their
national
honour
which
he
had
sworn
to
guard
it
glistened
with
that
undefinable
sensation
of
glowing
pride
which
soldiers
only
know
and
feel
most
deeply
on
an
occasion
like
this
the
regiment
was
attended
by
all
the
other
officers
of
the
garrison
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
and
was
loudly
cheered
as
they
passed
along
the
boats
waited
beside
the
pier
each
division
was
marched
in
an
orderly
manner
into
its
respective
boats
and
at
a
signal
given
the
oars
were
dipped
at
once
and
the
whole
mimic
fleet
stretched
at
their
utmost
speed
towards
the
ships
which
lay
at
some
distance
from
the
shore
three
hearty
english
cheers
followed
them
led
regularly
by
an
officer
of
distinction
who
stood
upon
a
capstan
for
the
purpose
while
the
band
of
his
corps
which
was
stationed
upon
the
pier
played
the
slow
march
of
the
departing
regiment
with
admirable
expression
the
three
cheers
were
as
heartily
returned
from
the
boats
and
the
gallant
corps
sped
quickly
on
to
their
vessels
compton
accompanied
his
son
on
board
and
stayed
as
long
as
it
was
possible
the
anchors
of
the
fleet
were
their
topsails
loosed
when
they
arrived
on
board
and
when
the
men
were
somewhat
settled
and
order
restored
the
signal
was
made
for
sailing
soon
the
anchors
were
at
the
the
topsails
sheeted
home
and
the
vast
fabrics
began
their
march
over
the
deep
to
be
continued
through
storm
or
calm
to
the
end
but
as
sail
after
sail
was
set
the
vessels
began
to
move
the
faster
until
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
retain
the
boat
which
was
towing
astern
in
which
he
was
to
return
he
was
aware
that
every
indulgence
had
been
shown
him
in
having
been
allowed
to
remain
so
long
and
he
could
make
no
opposition
to
its
being
ordered
alongside
may
he
who
alone
is
able
to
protect
you
herbert
he
said
as
he
wrung
his
hand
keep
you
in
health
you
go
i
am
well
aware
to
many
dangers
but
i
leave
you
in
confident
hope
that
we
may
meet
again
and
my
most
fervent
supplications
shall
ever
be
for
you
be
careful
of
yourself
you
are
strong
active
temperate
which
you
can
not
prize
too
highly
and
now
embrace
me
my
dear
dare
speak
no
he
left
the
deck
herbert
watched
him
down
the
side
safely
into
the
boat
the
rope
was
cast
off
and
in
another
instant
it
was
dancing
in
the
wake
of
the
vessel
astern
the
boatmen
set
their
sail
and
soon
the
tiny
bark
was
dancing
merrily
along
over
the
waters
herbert
gazed
till
it
became
a
speck
and
then
disappeared
but
compton
saw
the
tall
vessels
which
had
spread
every
sail
to
court
a
gentle
and
favourable
wind
longer
and
he
watched
the
last
faint
glitter
of
their
white
canvas
with
straining
eyes
and
an
aching
heart
till
he
could
see
them
no
longer
upon
the
blue
horizon
we
must
now
return
to
a
point
in
our
narrative
from
which
we
have
very
widely
digressed
in
order
to
put
our
readers
in
possession
of
what
we
have
detailed
of
the
history
of
herbert
compton
and
we
will
return
to
the
happy
party
which
was
assembled
round
the
cheerful
fire
at
alston
rectory
besides
the
family
amy
was
there
and
since
the
events
we
have
detailed
she
was
often
at
alston
for
days
together
she
was
bright
and
joyous
as
ever
indeed
much
improved
in
personal
appearance
little
more
than
a
year
had
elapsed
since
herbert
had
left
them
but
the
letters
he
had
written
had
been
so
regularly
received
that
the
miserable
apprehensions
which
all
had
indulged
on
his
departure
were
completely
dispelled
they
knew
that
he
was
happy
and
enjoyed
excellent
health
that
he
had
formed
pleasant
friendships
and
liked
the
country
which
he
described
with
eloquence
still
as
he
had
gone
on
service
soon
after
his
arrival
they
were
anxious
and
looked
eagerly
for
news
come
let
us
have
a
glee
girls
said
compton
after
a
game
of
forfeits
had
been
played
with
all
its
pleasant
noisy
fun
which
seems
now
to
have
abandoned
us
come
we
must
have
some
music
get
you
to
the
harpsichord
amy
and
i
will
help
out
my
own
bass
with
my
what
shall
we
sing
sir
answered
amy
gaily
going
at
once
to
the
instrument
here
are
all
kinds
lively
and
grave
ah
i
have
hit
at
once
upon
herbert
s
favourite
when
winds
breathe
very
good
you
could
not
have
anything
better
and
we
all
know
that
your
heart
will
be
in
your
song
let
us
the
parts
were
soon
arranged
amy
led
the
glee
the
delicious
harmony
of
which
appeared
to
float
in
the
air
above
their
heads
so
perfectly
was
it
sung
by
voices
excellent
in
themselves
and
attuned
by
constant
practice
others
followed
for
as
they
had
begun
with
glees
so
they
agreed
to
continue
at
last
after
a
pause
compton
patting
her
cheek
said
well
you
have
sung
so
well
amy
that
i
think
i
shall
have
a
letter
for
my
pet
a
letter
me
ah
sir
from
whom
not
from
herbert
indeed
i
hope
so
my
darling
added
compton
you
know
we
were
disappointed
by
the
last
packet
and
compton
heard
yesterday
from
his
london
agent
saying
that
a
bombay
vessel
had
arrived
with
letters
and
that
he
would
forward
ours
the
next
i
am
so
happy
dear
dear
compton
cried
the
joyful
girl
throwing
her
arms
around
her
and
kissing
her
i
feel
so
very
happy
and
when
will
the
letters
come
i
expect
the
boy
every
moment
with
the
bag
she
replied
he
should
have
been
here
before
this
but
perhaps
the
post
is
late
at
on
account
of
the
then
we
shall
have
a
delightful
evening
indeed
said
amy
shall
we
not
boys
and
girls
herbert
s
letters
to
all
of
you
shall
be
read
first
and
then
i
will
read
just
such
scraps
of
mine
as
i
please
you
know
how
i
love
to
tyrannise
over
you
and
tempt
you
with
a
great
deal
that
you
must
not
well
here
is
the
bag
cried
edward
taking
it
from
the
servant
who
just
then
entered
now
we
shall
see
and
he
opened
it
what
only
one
is
a
disappointment
it
is
for
you
ah
from
my
agents
i
see
perhaps
the
letters
have
not
been
delivered
but
we
shall
hear
all
about
they
crowded
round
him
but
poor
amy
s
heart
sunk
within
her
she
almost
sickened
lest
there
should
be
no
news
of
herbert
dear
sir
read
compton
we
are
sorry
to
inform
you
that
there
were
no
letters
for
you
or
for
miss
hayward
per
from
bombay
and
we
are
sorry
to
add
that
the
general
news
is
not
so
favourable
as
we
could
look
to
amy
look
to
amy
cried
compton
suddenly
and
anxiously
it
was
indeed
necessary
she
had
fainted
it
was
long
ere
she
recovered
she
had
naturally
a
powerful
mind
but
it
had
been
suddenly
perhaps
unadvisedly
excited
and
when
such
disappointment
ensued
she
had
not
been
able
to
bear
up
against
it
the
more
so
as
this
was
the
second
she
had
experienced
within
a
short
time
and
there
was
no
doubt
from
the
previous
public
information
that
severe
fighting
had
been
apprehended
in
which
herbert
s
regiment
must
take
a
part
in
vain
was
it
that
and
hayward
tried
to
console
her
had
felt
the
disappointment
as
keenly
as
amy
for
the
time
therefore
all
were
sad
and
the
evening
which
had
begun
so
cheerfully
was
concluded
in
painful
and
almost
silent
apprehension
nor
did
the
accounts
which
appeared
in
the
newspapers
some
days
afterwards
convey
to
them
any
alleviation
of
their
fears
chapter
xii
it
is
now
necessary
to
revisit
abdool
rhyman
khan
and
his
party
whom
we
left
at
a
small
village
in
the
pass
leading
behind
pencondah
and
in
their
company
to
travel
awhile
through
those
districts
which
lay
between
them
and
the
city
whither
they
were
bound
there
were
no
dangers
now
in
their
path
no
attacks
from
the
mahrattas
to
be
apprehended
nor
was
there
the
irksome
heat
which
oppressed
and
wearied
them
before
a
few
showers
had
already
fallen
the
earth
had
put
on
its
verdant
covering
and
travelling
was
now
a
pleasure
more
than
a
fatigue
the
khan
had
intended
proceeding
by
easy
stages
but
the
news
he
had
heard
of
rumours
of
fresh
wars
of
the
personal
activity
of
tippoo
among
the
army
which
was
always
the
forerunner
of
some
campaign
made
him
more
than
usually
solicitous
to
press
forward
so
on
the
fifth
day
they
were
at
balapoor
and
leaving
the
lady
to
the
care
of
the
servants
to
rest
for
awhile
the
khan
accompanied
by
kasim
rode
forward
to
the
town
and
fort
of
nundidgroog
where
he
knew
some
of
his
own
men
were
stationed
do
you
see
that
pile
of
rocks
yonder
said
the
khan
to
kasim
as
they
rode
along
i
do
why
do
you
ask
because
he
replied
that
is
a
place
well
worth
seeing
and
one
which
was
a
rare
favourite
of
hyder
ali
his
memory
be
honoured
why
had
he
a
there
yes
there
is
a
sort
of
a
house
there
to
be
sure
returned
the
khan
laughing
but
not
one
of
pleasure
i
should
think
many
a
poor
wretch
has
been
in
it
who
would
have
given
the
wealth
of
the
world
had
he
possessed
it
to
have
got
out
it
is
a
prison
then
it
is
and
one
from
which
but
few
return
how
so
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
they
are
murdered
i
mean
to
tell
you
plainly
that
you
had
better
not
get
into
it
few
of
our
people
have
ever
been
sent
there
for
it
is
reserved
for
the
kafir
their
tribe
be
accursed
a
few
of
them
are
now
and
then
thrown
from
the
top
to
terrify
the
rest
into
submission
to
the
sultaun
s
will
and
to
become
a
feast
for
the
kites
and
crows
look
i
suppose
some
of
them
have
been
cast
over
lately
for
there
are
vultures
wheeling
in
the
air
overhead
and
making
stoops
as
if
they
would
kasim
shuddered
he
thought
it
a
base
death
for
any
one
to
die
to
be
thrown
from
reach
the
bottom
haply
alive
to
be
left
to
struggle
there
maimed
and
linger
till
death
came
accelerated
perhaps
by
the
jackals
or
vultures
have
you
ever
seen
this
khan
asked
kasim
never
but
i
know
those
who
have
the
office
of
executioner
is
no
enviable
one
to
a
soldier
and
he
who
has
this
post
though
as
arrant
a
coward
as
can
well
be
in
the
field
yet
can
stand
by
and
see
brave
men
hurled
over
these
rocks
for
to
do
them
justice
the
english
are
brave
as
lions
and
their
courage
can
not
be
quelled
we
learned
that
at
perambaukum
to
our
ay
i
have
heard
of
that
report
states
it
to
have
been
a
good
mashalla
you
may
say
so
and
blessed
be
alla
the
arms
of
the
true
believers
were
victorious
over
the
infidels
yet
they
fought
well
and
though
a
handful
of
men
defied
our
utmost
attacks
and
continued
then
you
were
there
ali
khan
yes
i
was
then
in
the
royal
guard
and
i
was
desired
by
hyder
peace
be
on
his
name
to
protect
tippoo
sahib
who
led
the
charges
he
fought
like
a
tiger
as
he
is
and
many
of
the
infidels
tasted
of
death
at
his
hand
but
one
of
them
as
we
charged
and
overthrew
their
last
square
made
a
thrust
with
his
bayonet
at
the
young
prince
to
mahomed
parried
and
in
return
caused
him
to
taste
of
death
the
young
man
never
forgot
that
deed
and
some
others
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
perform
before
him
and
i
am
what
i
then
like
those
of
his
rank
he
does
not
forget
benefits
never
he
is
faithful
to
those
he
loves
but
a
bitter
foe
to
those
who
provoke
him
above
all
the
english
are
his
detestation
he
sees
their
restless
love
of
intrigue
and
power
he
knows
how
they
have
sown
dissensions
in
bengal
and
wrested
many
fair
provinces
from
the
sway
of
the
true
believers
he
fears
their
abilities
and
knowledge
of
the
arts
of
war
and
though
he
has
some
french
in
his
service
yet
he
can
see
plainly
enough
that
they
have
not
the
powers
of
the
others
either
to
contrive
or
to
execute
above
all
he
fears
the
prophecy
about
him
by
a
holy
man
whom
he
consulted
which
no
doubt
you
have
no
indeed
i
have
not
heard
that
ajaib
it
is
very
strange
but
how
could
you
after
all
know
then
that
as
he
sat
one
day
in
one
of
the
innermost
apartments
of
the
palace
in
the
garden
of
the
deria
no
one
could
by
any
possibility
have
access
to
him
and
where
he
was
engaged
in
was
heard
a
voice
conversing
with
him
and
his
was
gradually
raised
till
it
became
furious
as
inshalla
it
often
does
to
the
terror
of
his
taajoob
exclaimed
kasim
who
was
it
willa
alum
god
knows
replied
the
khan
but
listen
it
is
said
the
mushaek
so
he
appeared
to
to
him
with
a
loud
voice
and
bade
him
beware
of
the
english
feringhees
for
they
were
plotting
against
him
and
that
though
the
day
was
far
distant
yet
danger
threatened
him
from
them
which
could
not
be
avoided
then
some
say
that
the
being
may
alla
forgive
me
if
he
hears
it
upbraided
the
sultaun
with
many
errors
of
faith
and
with
being
given
to
idolatry
in
private
and
with
doing
magic
to
the
hurt
of
his
own
soul
and
it
was
this
which
made
him
so
footnote
holy
man
and
who
was
it
after
all
alla
knows
said
the
khan
mysteriously
alla
knows
some
people
say
it
was
a
fakeer
named
shah
yoonoos
who
had
wandered
in
unknown
to
anybody
and
had
reached
the
sultaun
s
chamber
but
others
say
it
was
one
of
the
spirits
of
the
air
over
whom
it
is
known
he
has
power
who
had
taken
that
form
to
visit
him
by
day
but
alla
only
knows
the
truth
after
all
certain
it
is
however
that
he
does
perform
rites
which
i
as
a
humble
and
pious
mahomedan
would
object
did
no
one
try
to
seize
the
intruder
many
so
it
is
said
but
he
passed
forth
from
among
them
all
and
has
not
been
seen
most
extraordinary
certainly
i
marvel
not
now
khan
that
he
should
be
so
suspicious
of
the
english
i
for
one
long
to
have
a
blow
with
them
and
to
see
how
they
inshalla
the
opportunity
will
not
be
long
wanting
you
will
have
it
ere
you
have
been
long
with
us
but
among
our
people
here
we
shall
learn
something
for
they
have
always
the
quickest
information
from
the
shortly
afterwards
they
rode
into
the
outer
court
of
the
temple
of
nundi
at
the
town
under
the
fort
of
nundidroog
and
the
scene
which
presented
itself
to
the
eyes
of
kasim
was
as
novel
as
it
was
interesting
the
court
was
a
large
square
contained
in
a
sort
of
piazza
formed
by
a
colonnade
of
huge
square
blocks
of
granite
placed
in
three
rows
about
twelve
feet
asunder
each
piece
probably
sixteen
feet
in
height
across
these
at
the
top
to
form
a
roof
were
transverse
pieces
of
equal
length
the
spaces
between
the
pillars
thus
placed
formed
excellent
stalls
for
horses
and
the
enormous
area
was
thus
converted
into
one
huge
stable
of
old
the
brahmin
priests
had
wandered
dispensing
charitable
aid
to
the
wretched
or
instructing
those
who
thirsted
for
knowledge
in
the
centre
were
a
few
gay
tents
and
many
camels
were
sitting
and
standing
around
them
several
elephants
too
were
busied
with
huge
piles
of
leafy
branches
before
them
selecting
the
tenderest
morsels
and
brushing
away
flies
with
others
around
were
groups
of
men
lying
under
a
rude
screen
formed
of
three
spears
tied
together
with
a
cloth
thrown
over
them
others
lounging
and
swaggering
about
gaily
dressed
and
armed
to
the
teeth
many
were
gathered
into
knots
and
either
sitting
upon
spread
carpets
or
standing
together
were
occupied
in
smoking
or
listening
to
some
itinerant
musicians
or
storytellers
in
various
parts
were
little
booths
where
coarse
confectionery
was
sold
and
many
a
group
of
with
their
keen
and
shrewd
eyes
were
sitting
on
the
ground
naked
to
the
waist
with
heaps
of
courees
and
pice
spread
before
them
there
were
women
selling
fruit
out
of
baskets
and
sacks
others
hawking
about
sour
curds
with
a
thousand
other
busy
bustling
occupations
going
on
with
vigour
for
which
the
presence
of
the
cavalry
found
full
employment

before
them
and
above
the
piazzas
appeared
the
richly
ornamented
and
curious
high
pyramidical
roofs
of
the
temples
and
their
massive
and
decorated
gateway
and
above
all
frowned
the
bare
rock
of
the
fort
naked
mass
of
about
eight
hundred
feet
perpendicular
arising
from
a
rugged
and
woody
slope
of
an
equal
height
the
walls
around
the
summit
which
were
built
upon
the
very
giddy
verge
were
bristling
with
cannon
and
the
numbers
of
men
about
showed
that
it
possessed
many
defenders
all
these
objects
assisted
by
the
bright
colours
of
the
costumes
the
caparisons
of
the
horses
camels
and
elephants
some
of
which
were
already
equipped
for
travel
formed
a
picture
which
glowing
under
the
slanting
beams
of
an
afternoon
sun
caused
the
young
man
s
heart
to
bound
with
delight
as
they
entered
the
large
square
and
rode
onwards
among
the
motley
crowd
what
think
you
of
my
fine
fellows
kasim
said
the
khan
as
they
passed
various
groups
of
stout
men
inshalla
they
are
worth
looking
they
most
truly
are
replied
the
young
man
who
was
to
say
the
truth
somewhat
bewildered
by
the
excitement
of
the
scene
and
do
you
really
command
all
these
o
khan
most
of
them
i
daresay
are
my
youths
kasim
but
i
have
no
doubt
some
of
the
garrison
of
the
fort
are
here
also
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
distinguish
them
but
these
are
not
all
mashalla
and
praise
to
the
sultaun
s
bounty
we
have
as
many
more
at
three
times
as
the
city
but
there
is
surely
more
activity
than
usual
going
on
and
this
looks
marvellously
like
the
preparations
for
a
march
so
let
us
press
on
to
the
tent
yonder
for
there
shall
we
find
hubeeb
oolla
khan
or
shekh
jaffur
sahib
my
jemadars
who
will
answer
my
queries
i
marvel
none
of
my
rogues
have
yet
found
me
why
they
can
hardly
see
your
face
khan
said
kasim
and
i
daresay
they
little
expect
you
to
drop
as
it
were
from
the
clouds
thus
suddenly
among
perhaps
not
but
here
we
are
at
the
tent
dismount
and
let
us
enter
as
he
spoke
the
khan
alighted
and
unfolding
the
muslin
scarf
which
had
been
tied
about
his
face
he
was
instantly
recognised
by
a
number
of
the
men
who
were
lounging
about
in
front
of
it
and
who
now
crowded
round
him
with
congratulations
the
khan
sahib
is
come
shouted
several
to
their
companions
my
lord
s
footsteps
are
welcome
cried
those
who
were
nearest
inshalla
victory
waits
upon
it
is
a
fortunate
hour
that
has
brought
him
cried
another
who
pressed
forward
and
bowed
before
him
what
are
my
lord
s
wishes
let
him
order
his
slave
dilawur
ali
to
perform
ha
art
thou
there
friend
said
the
khan
well
since
thou
wishest
for
employment
go
on
and
tell
the
jemadar
sahib
that
i
am
here
which
of
the
officers
is
with
you
jaffur
sahib
khodawund
he
will
have
rare
news
for
my
lord
and
he
departed
this
looks
like
a
march
said
the
khan
to
another
say
is
it
so
it
is
protector
of
the
poor
but
we
know
but
little
of
the
true
cause
as
yet
though
many
rumours
are
afloat
the
most
prevalent
but
here
he
was
interrupted
by
the
jemadar
himself
who
had
hurried
from
his
tent
and
now
advanced
towards
them
the
two
leaders
embraced
cordially
you
are
welcome
khan
sahib
said
jaffur
but
do
not
remain
here
come
i
pray
you
to
your
servant
s
tent
and
rest
after
your
he
went
in
and
was
soon
seated
upon
the
soft
cushions
of
the
jemadar
s
musnud
kasim
followed
but
uncertain
how
to
act
he
continued
standing
until
he
was
desired
by
the
khan
to
be
seated
near
him
this
together
with
the
khan
s
marked
attention
to
the
young
man
appeared
rather
to
disconcert
the
jemadar
who
regarded
the
new
comer
with
some
suspicion
and
kasim
could
not
help
imagining
with
some
dislike
i
shall
have
an
enemy
in
this
man
thought
kasim
for
an
instant
but
again
he
reflected
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
and
soon
ceased
to
regard
the
furtive
looks
of
the
jemadar
which
were
cast
upon
him
from
time
to
time
as
the
khan
appealed
to
him
in
support
of
his
opinions
or
remarks
during
the
conversation
which
naturally
turned
upon
the
movements
of
the
corps
of
cavalry
he
commanded
it
was
true
that
the
corps
was
about
to
move
all
the
outposts
except
a
few
of
those
immediately
upon
the
mahratta
frontier
had
been
called
in
and
had
joined
within
the
past
day
or
two
and
the
morrow
had
been
fixed
for
the
departure
of
the
whole
from
nundidroog
towards
the
capital
for
the
reason
of
this
many
rumours
were
in
circulation
the
jemadar
said
that
a
sudden
rupture
with
the
english
was
one
that
there
was
only
to
be
a
muster
of
the
cavalry
was
another
and
after
that
was
finished
the
sultaun
intended
to
go
into
the
forest
bordering
upon
coorg
but
there
was
a
third
which
had
been
confirmed
by
news
that
day
received
from
the
city
that
some
very
angry
messages
had
passed
between
the
rajah
of
travancore
and
the
sultaun
and
that
both
had
ordered
musters
of
their
forces
this
the
jemadar
thought
the
most
likely
of
all
as
he
knew
there
had
been
negotiations
pending
between
the
sultaun
and
the
rajah
relative
to
some
forts
which
had
been
taken
possession
of
in
a
manner
that
did
not
appear
warrantable
by
the
latter
for
the
present
the
khan
and
kasim
were
the
guests
of
the
jemadar
and
having
partaken
of
refreshment
they
set
out
to
procure
a
resting
place
for
the
night
or
one
where
they
should
be
able
to
have
their
tents
pitched
as
they
went
forth
many
were
the
hearty
greetings
which
saluted
the
khan
every
veteran
especially
whose
bronzed
and
furrowed
face
showed
that
the
scorching
heats
of
summer
had
for
many
a
year
passed
over
him
in
constant
and
active
employment
and
many
a
man
whose
face
or
breast
gave
a
sure
proof
of
often
tried
courage
met
him
with
that
hearty
familiarity
and
yet
scrupulous
deference
which
while
it
yielded
nothing
to
the
man
yet
showed
submission
to
authority
and
high
respect
for
rank
all
were
unanimous
in
rejoicing
that
the
khan
had
returned
in
such
terms
as
while
it
gratified
kasim
to
think
he
had
become
the
friend
and
companion
of
one
so
honoured
and
beloved
caused
him
also
to
suspect
that
the
jemadar
jaffur
sahib
was
not
much
liked
among
them
nor
indeed
was
he
sprung
from
the
lowest
rank
of
the
people
he
possessed
ferocity
of
character
which
had
early
attracted
the
notice
of
the
sultaun
and
he
had
risen
rapidly
to
the
station
he
held
he
had
also
been
a
ready
instrument
in
his
hand
to
effect
any
cruelty
he
willed
and
if
war
was
to
be
carried
into
any
district
where
mahomedanism
had
not
advanced
and
forcible
conversions
of
the
inhabitants
were
to
be
made
or
if
any
of
the
unoffending
people
were
to
be
hung
because
they
would
not
become
converts
jaffur
sahib
was
generally
selected
as
well
from
his
address
as
a
soldier
as
from
his
unscrupulous
character
from
among
the
others
of
the
same
stamp
who
abounded
about
the
person
of
the
sultaun
he
was
born
at
arcot
and
inherited
all
the
narrow
prejudice
and
extreme
bigotry
peculiar
to
his
townsmen
and
hated
all
english
with
a
malignity
in
which
perhaps
he
was
only
excelled
through
all
that
host
by
the
sultaun
himself
the
presence
of
kasim
in
such
intimate
association
with
his
commander
immediately
became
a
source
of
vexation
to
him
and
as
suddenly
as
he
had
seen
him
he
had
conceived
a
violent
aversion
to
him
he
saw
generous
courage
honesty
and
faithfulness
written
upon
the
brow
of
the
young
man
and
as
none
of
these
found
any
place
in
his
own
heart
so
did
he
at
once
dislike
the
fancied
possessor
of
them
for
he
knew
the
khan
s
generous
nature
and
how
easily
all
the
authority
he
had
by
incessant
intrigues
possessed
himself
of
might
be
reduced
in
a
moment
by
one
who
after
becoming
acquainted
with
the
details
of
the
service
could
not
fail
of
observing
that
many
abuses
existed
under
his
fostering
care
the
khan
had
not
mentioned
kasim
to
him
nor
could
he
divine
in
what
capacity
he
attended
upon
his
person
and
he
burned
with
curiosity
to
discover
when
the
khan
was
gone
therefore
he
addressed
himself
to
his
chief
sontaburdar
or
bearer
of
a
silver
club
whose
name
was
madar
sahib
a
man
who
had
followed
his
fortunes
and
often
shared
whatever
spoil
was
wrung
from
the
unfortunate
whom
they
could
get
into
their
power
there
was
something
too
in
his
retainer
s
face
which
seemed
to
expect
the
question
and
at
the
slight
turn
of
his
master
towards
him
who
had
been
musing
with
the
finger
of
deliberation
placed
between
the
teeth
of
vexation
he
folded
his
hands
and
bent
himself
to
listen
they
were
alone
for
every
one
else
had
followed
the
khan
when
he
went
out
the
curses
of
the
shietan
upon
the
old
fool
he
said
could
not
he
have
kept
away
for
a
day
longer
i
tell
thee
madar
this
appearance
of
his
is
not
only
a
thousand
rupees
out
of
my
pocket
but
the
loss
to
me
of
all
the
honour
credit
and
influence
which
a
short
campaign
would
have
given
i
say
a
curse
on
ameen
said
his
servant
my
lord
s
star
is
unfortunate
but
inshalla
it
will
and
then
that
boy
that
he
has
brought
with
him
he
continued
not
heeding
the
other
s
remark
i
ll
warrant
his
prime
favourite
knowest
thou
aught
of
him
nothing
khodawund
but
i
can
do
so
what
hath
brought
them
together
perhaps
he
is
the
brother
of
this
new
wife
he
has
old
dotard
if
so
we
may
soon
expect
to
get
our
leave
to
depart
madar
for
the
old
khan
will
use
his
utmost
influence
to
secure
a
good
place
near
himself
for
his
alla
forbid
my
lord
has
no
cause
to
think
so
as
yet
but
i
go
and
will
soon
bring
the
while
this
colloquy
was
going
on
the
khan
and
kasim
had
gone
forward
to
seek
for
a
place
of
temporary
refuge
and
after
examining
many
parts
of
the
broken
cloisters
all
of
which
afforded
but
indifferent
shelter
dilawur
ali
who
had
been
looking
about
suddenly
returned
i
have
found
a
place
o
khan
he
cried
come
and
see
it
is
clean
and
if
we
had
any
kanats
we
could
make
it
comfortable
enough
for
a
night
s
footnote
they
followed
him
onwards
to
the
end
of
the
large
square
and
entering
through
a
small
doorway
found
themselves
in
a
square
court
in
the
centre
of
which
was
a
cistern
of
water
which
could
be
approached
by
easy
steps
for
the
convenience
of
bathers
there
was
a
deep
cloister
all
round
supported
upon
carved
pillars
of
wood
which
afforded
ample
accommodation
for
the
khan
s
party
it
was
the
upper
part
of
the
outside
however
which
attracted
their
attention
and
admiration
and
indeed
the
exquisite
design
and
ornaments
of
the
screen
would
merit
a
description
at
our
hands
if
anything
so
intricate
could
be
described
so
as
to
give
any
idea
of
the
building
but
it
consisted
of
a
regular
number
of
highly
ornamented
niches
in
the
most
florid
hindoo
style
each
niche
containing
some
image
of
hindoo
veneration
male
or
female
in
grotesque
attitudes
the
whole
was
of
pure
white
stucco
and
contrasted
brightly
with
the
dark
green
of
some
noble
which
nodded
over
it
their
light
feathery
sprays
mingling
with
the
innumerable
angles
and
pinnacles
of
the
architecture
above
these
rose
the
tall
summits
of
the
temples
and
again
the
naked
grey
mass
of
the
huge
granite
rock
frowned
over
all
appearing
to
overhang
the
scene
ay
this
will
do
right
well
cried
the
khan
we
have
not
been
in
such
comfortable
quarters
for
many
days
the
camels
will
soon
be
here
and
then
a
place
can
be
screened
off
and
made
private
often
as
i
have
been
at
the
fort
i
never
discovered
this
quiet
spot
before
truly
the
kafir
who
built
it
had
wisdom
and
for
once
may
the
prophet
pardon
me
i
honour
one
of
the
accursed
race
what
sayest
thou
kasim
i
doubt
not
that
forgiveness
will
be
easily
granted
for
an
offence
so
slight
khan
sahib
i
confess
that
i
for
one
have
many
friends
among
the
unbelievers
and
though
i
hate
their
idolatry
yet
i
can
not
help
loving
their
gentle
dispositions
and
admiring
their
genius
which
after
all
is
the
gift
of
alla
to
them
as
much
as
to
you
must
not
give
vent
to
such
opinions
as
those
kasim
replied
the
khan
must
he
dilawur
ali
for
at
the
city
there
is
nought
breathed
but
destruction
of
the
infidels
of
all
denominations
and
if
thou
wouldst
not
make
enemies
thou
must
chime
in
with
the
prevailing
humour
or
keep
thy
thoughts
to
good
advice
noble
khan
said
dilawur
ali
there
are
quick
ears
enough
to
hear
and
ready
tongues
enough
to
convey
to
the
sultaun
may
his
prosperity
increase
whatever
malice
or
spite
may
dictate
to
bad
hearts
and
we
need
not
go
very
far
from
this
place
to
find
many
thou
must
pardon
this
freedom
of
speech
he
continued
to
the
young
man
but
i
am
an
old
soldier
and
the
khan
sahib
can
tell
you
that
i
have
fought
beside
him
and
i
have
often
known
a
young
man
ruined
by
indiscretions
of
which
he
was
not
i
thank
you
much
for
your
speech
said
kasim
and
desire
your
friendship
inshalla
we
shall
know
each
other
well
ere
inshalla
replied
the
other
when
the
khan
sahib
is
settled
here
for
the
night
safely
if
you
will
come
to
my
tent
i
will
give
you
such
information
regarding
this
our
service
i
presume
you
have
joined
it
may
be
of
use
to
you
ay
go
to
him
kasim
said
the
khan
dilawur
ali
is
a
syud
a
worthy
man
and
religious
too
all
respects
fit
for
thy
company
from
him
thou
wilt
learn
many
things
which
i
could
not
tell
thee
and
which
will
not
be
lost
upon
as
they
spoke
the
palankeen
of
the
khan
was
seen
approaching
bearers
with
some
difficulty
threading
their
way
through
the
crowd
kasim
ran
to
meet
it
and
conduct
it
to
the
spot
where
the
khan
was
and
for
the
first
time
for
many
days
nay
since
the
attack
upon
the
village
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
fair
inmate
for
the
doors
were
slightly
open
as
it
approached
and
though
as
a
good
mussulman
ought
to
do
he
would
have
turned
away
his
head
from
any
other
yet
he
could
not
resist
the
opportunity
of
looking
through
the
crevice
and
he
thought
that
if
perchance
her
eye
should
rest
on
his
a
moment
s
glance
would
satisfy
him
and
would
assure
him
that
he
was
not
forgotten
the
bearers
were
about
to
make
a
wrong
turn
as
they
came
up
and
kasim
called
loudly
to
them
ameena
heard
his
voice
and
the
temptation
to
steal
a
passing
glance
at
him
who
we
must
own
had
been
more
in
her
thoughts
than
her
lord
might
have
liked
could
he
have
seen
them
caused
her
to
withdraw
from
her
face
the
end
of
her
garment
with
which
she
had
covered
it
for
an
instant
that
she
might
see
the
better
she
would
not
have
done
so
perhaps
could
she
have
guessed
that
he
was
looking
for
her
but
as
it
happened
some
obstruction
in
the
way
of
the
bearers
obliged
them
to
stop
so
close
to
him
that
the
palankeen
brushed
his
person
and
they
could
have
spoken
so
near
were
they
their
eyes
met
once
more
his
in
admiration
which
he
could
not
conceal
hers
in
confusion
which
impelled
her
instantly
to
cover
her
face
but
not
before
she
had
seen
that
the
scarf
she
had
given
him
to
bind
up
his
wound
still
occupied
a
prominent
place
upon
his
breast
he
has
not
thrown
it
away
she
said
to
herself
she
little
knew
how
he
valued
it
her
palankeen
was
carried
on
through
the
door
into
the
place
we
have
described
the
others
had
departed
and
she
was
alone
with
her
lord
who
bidding
her
his
usual
hearty
and
kind
welcome
opened
the
doors
wide
and
displayed
to
her
the
view
which
had
surprised
and
delighted
the
others
previously
and
she
broke
out
into
a
burst
of
girlish
admiration
at
a
sight
she
so
little
expected
when
her
palankeen
entered
the
gloomy
doorway
chapter
xiii
madar
waited
for
a
while
until
he
saw
that
the
khan
s
servants
had
arrived
when
taking
his
silver
stick
of
office
with
him
he
sought
their
little
separate
encampment
which
busy
as
it
had
seemed
elsewhere
was
now
swallowed
up
in
the
mass
that
occupied
the
space
around
them
he
lurked
about
the
busy
and
tired
men
for
some
time
not
hazarding
a
remark
to
any
one
lest
he
should
meet
with
a
sharp
repulse
which
indeed
was
to
be
expected
seeing
that
after
a
long
march
men
who
must
provide
and
cook
their
dinners
have
much
more
to
do
than
to
hold
conversations
with
prying
inquirers
at
last
seeing
daood
the
khan
s
attendant
busy
preparing
his
master
s
hooka
he
advanced
towards
him
and
seated
himself
upon
his
hams
close
to
him
salaam
aliekoom
brother
said
he
salaam
was
the
only
reply
daood
chose
to
give
mashalla
the
khan
has
returned
in
good
shookr
khoda
he
inshalla
he
will
long
continue
inshalla
and
so
he
has
married
a
young
wife
well
the
khan
is
a
powerful
man
youth
inshalla
brother
and
daood
continued
his
employment
most
assiduously
humming
a
popular
tune
the
brother
of
the
khanum
is
a
his
prosperity
increase
daood
looked
at
the
speaker
with
no
amicable
eyes
who
in
the
name
of
the
sheitan
art
thou
o
unlucky
man
how
darest
thou
even
in
thy
speech
to
allude
to
the
khanum
and
what
mean
these
questions
go
stay
not
here
or
it
may
be
that
some
of
our
folks
may
lay
a
stick
over
thee
and
haply
myself
if
thou
stayest
much
longer
go
i
tell
thee
or
thou
mayst
chance
to
eat
madar
saw
plainly
enough
there
was
little
to
be
gained
by
conversation
with
daood
so
he
left
him
and
after
a
while
tried
a
groom
who
was
busy
with
one
of
the
khan
s
horses
with
him
he
was
more
successful
and
soon
he
learned
the
history
of
the
young
man
and
the
events
which
had
occurred
during
their
march
from
hyderabad
stored
with
these
he
was
preparing
to
depart
when
he
was
roughly
accosted
by
kasim
and
dilawur
ali
who
had
observed
him
in
conversation
with
the
groom
for
dilawur
ali
well
knew
the
character
of
the
man
to
be
of
the
worst
kind
and
that
the
inquiries
he
was
making
were
to
gratify
the
curiosity
of
his
master
or
perhaps
to
serve
worse
purposes
dilawur
ali
was
an
officer
who
commanded
a
duffa
or
division
of
the
corps
and
a
man
of
some
authority
so
he
cared
little
now
that
his
commander
had
arrived
either
for
the
man
or
his
master
for
he
was
secure
in
the
khan
s
favour
and
well
knew
that
the
jemadar
dared
not
complain
to
him
even
should
his
servant
receive
ill
usage
or
at
any
rate
hard
words
so
he
cried
out
lustily
ho
madar
sahib
what
seekest
thou
among
the
servants
of
the
khan
by
the
soul
of
the
prophet
thine
appearance
is
like
a
bird
of
the
first
vulture
to
a
dying
sheep
what
has
he
been
asking
of
thee
he
said
to
the
groom
speak
and
fear
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
replied
the
man
he
did
but
ask
about
the
patél
sahib
yonder
for
so
kasim
continued
to
be
called
among
them
and
what
wouldst
thou
know
about
me
o
cried
kasim
what
am
i
to
thee
or
to
thy
master
nothing
nothing
noble
sir
only
my
master
may
his
prosperity
increase
bid
me
ask
in
order
that
he
might
know
something
of
one
whose
appearance
is
so
like
that
of
a
youth
brave
in
war
and
he
saw
too
that
your
worship
had
been
wounded
and
naturally
wished
to
know
whether
the
khan
sahib
may
his
name
be
exalted
had
been
in
any
danger
on
the
way
down
which
may
alla
avert
thy
words
are
smooth
for
once
said
dilawur
ali
and
well
calculated
to
disarm
suspicion
but
i
know
thee
well
madar
sahib
and
thy
master
too
and
i
warn
thee
of
both
kasim
in
the
present
case
there
may
be
no
harm
meant
and
perhaps
it
is
unjust
to
accuse
or
to
suspect
thee
but
thou
hadst
as
well
take
the
hint
for
inshalla
we
are
neither
fathers
of
owls
or
of
jackasses
and
can
see
and
hear
as
far
as
other
people
dost
thou
understand
i
will
tell
thee
more
plainly
madar
sahib
said
the
young
patél
blood
was
fired
by
the
thought
that
any
one
should
be
so
soon
prying
into
his
affairs
in
the
camp
that
if
ever
i
catch
thee
about
this
encampment
of
ours
or
tampering
with
any
of
my
lord
the
khan
s
servants
i
will
break
every
bone
in
thy
skin
dost
thou
hear
my
lord
began
the
fellow
nay
no
more
continued
kasim
or
i
may
be
tempted
to
give
way
to
wrath
begone
in
the
name
of
the
devils
on
whose
errand
thou
camest
i
like
thee
not
by
alla
thy
face
is
like
an
executioner
s
fellow
who
would
give
a
brave
man
a
cup
of
poison
or
stab
him
from
behind
with
a
knife
and
boast
he
had
done
some
valiant
some
others
who
were
standing
by
caught
the
words
of
the
young
man
and
laughed
loudly
at
the
truth
he
had
so
unwittingly
told
and
their
taunts
added
to
the
previous
ones
he
had
been
obliged
to
hear
caused
madar
to
slink
off
as
fast
as
possible
followed
by
the
jeers
and
abuse
of
those
who
had
joined
in
the
laugh
against
him
he
is
off
like
a
maimed
cur
cried
one
you
have
eaten
dirt
cried
another
alla
give
thee
a
good
digestion
of
it
and
appetite
for
more
the
next
time
thou
comest
let
us
seize
him
and
cut
off
his
beard
and
mustachios
such
an
impotent
coward
and
prying
rascal
is
not
worthy
to
wear
the
emblems
of
him
be
shaven
like
an
eunuch
cried
a
masculine
virago
the
wife
of
a
setting
her
arms
who
thought
it
a
fair
opportunity
to
join
in
return
o
madar
sahib
that
i
may
spit
on
thy
beard
madar
did
not
apparently
choose
to
accept
this
polite
invitation
for
he
thought
it
possible
that
the
first
threat
might
be
attempted
and
the
shout
of
laughter
which
followed
the
latter
part
of
the
speech
caused
him
to
quicken
his
pace
considerably
and
only
once
looking
behind
him
to
throw
a
glance
of
hate
towards
those
by
whom
he
had
been
menaced
he
pursued
his
way
and
was
soon
lost
in
the
crowd
there
goes
a
spiteful
heart
said
kasim
didst
thou
see
the
look
he
cast
behind
him
ay
brother
replied
dilawur
ali
thou
hast
said
truly
he
has
a
spiteful
heart
and
i
could
tell
thee
many
a
tale
of
his
iniquity
but
i
am
half
sorry
that
we
did
not
speak
him
i
am
not
i
would
rather
have
an
open
enemy
than
one
under
the
garb
of
civility
or
the
scoundrel
will
tell
all
he
has
heard
and
as
much
more
as
he
can
invent
to
the
jemadar
and
what
of
that
said
kasim
what
have
i
to
fear
this
is
no
place
to
speak
of
him
said
his
friend
come
to
my
tent
i
will
tell
thee
much
of
and
truly
the
account
the
worthy
syud
gave
of
the
jemadar
was
not
calculated
in
any
way
to
allay
fear
if
any
had
existed
in
kasim
s
heart
for
it
was
one
of
deceit
of
villainy
often
successful
of
constant
intrigue
and
of
cruel
revenge
but
the
young
man
s
fearless
spirit
only
made
light
of
these
which
might
have
disquieted
a
more
experienced
person
and
he
asked
gaily
but
what
makest
thee
think
that
he
bears
me
any
enmity
we
have
as
yet
hardly
seen
each
i
know
it
from
his
vile
face
kasim
while
the
khan
often
spoke
to
thee
kindly
in
his
presence
his
eyes
wandered
to
thee
with
a
bad
expression
and
they
no
sooner
left
thee
than
he
and
that
sontaburdar
of
his
exchanged
furtive
glances
i
was
watching
them
for
i
saw
at
once
he
would
be
jealous
of
he
may
do
his
worst
said
kasim
i
care
but
in
spite
of
this
expression
his
heart
was
not
quite
so
free
of
care
about
what
had
happened
as
it
had
been
before
he
had
heard
dilawur
ali
s
stories
madar
returned
burning
with
spiteful
and
revengeful
feelings
and
with
much
excitement
visible
in
his
countenance
he
rushed
into
his
master
s
presence
and
flung
his
turban
on
the
ground
while
he
gnashed
his
teeth
in
rage
what
news
hast
thou
madar
what
has
been
done
to
thee
speak
good
man
what
has
happened
judge
if
i
have
not
cause
to
be
revenged
khodawund
i
am
less
than
a
dog
and
may
my
grave
be
unblessed
if
i
do
not
avenge
the
insults
i
have
suffered
both
for
myself
and
you
o
my
lord
why
what
has
happened
i
tell
you
you
have
been
reviled
by
that
son
of
perdition
dilawur
ali
and
the
boy
whom
that
old
fool
the
khan
has
brought
with
him
hear
jemadar
sahib
what
they
said
they
said
they
and
madar
twisted
up
his
mustachios
fiercely
as
he
spoke
defile
your
beard
and
throw
dirt
on
it
they
called
you
a
coward
and
less
than
man
they
said
they
did
not
value
you
a
broken
couree
and
they
threatened
to
beat
me
to
break
every
bone
in
my
skin
and
set
up
a
vile
woman
one
without
shame
with
an
uncovered
face
to
abuse
me
in
vile
terms
to
call
me
an
eunuch
and
to
threaten
to
shave
my
beard
and
mustachios
and
this
before
a
thousand
others
loochas
and
shodas
like
themselves
but
i
will
be
revenged
ya
alla
ya
hoosein
ya
hyder
he
cried
as
he
took
up
his
turban
which
he
had
thrown
down
in
his
passion
and
began
to
tie
it
awry
upon
his
head
i
will
be
revenged
footnote
dissolute
vagabonds
they
said
this
kumbukht
the
jemadar
who
had
heard
out
his
servant
s
tale
with
some
difficulty
they
said
it
thou
hadst
ears
to
hear
it
alla
alla
am
i
a
sheep
or
a
cow
to
bear
this
who
am
inshalla
a
tiger
an
eater
of
men
s
hearts
whom
men
s
livers
turn
to
water
i
should
be
obliged
to
devour
such
abomination
what
ho
furashes
any
one
without
there
go
bring
dilawur
ali
duffadar
but
no
he
said
mentally
checking
the
torrent
of
passion
it
can
not
be
so
i
have
no
authority
now
to
punish
and
they
would
defy
me
the
khan
would
take
fire
in
a
moment
if
he
heard
i
had
been
inquiring
into
the
station
of
this
proud
youth
inshalla
i
will
yet
go
he
continued
to
the
servants
who
had
suddenly
entered
the
tent
when
i
want
you
i
will
call
again
at
present
i
would
be
alone
with
and
so
thou
heardest
all
this
abuse
of
me
and
ate
dirt
thyself
and
had
not
the
heart
to
say
a
word
or
strike
a
blow
in
return
i
could
spit
on
thee
coward
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
khodawund
i
was
helpless
what
could
i
have
done
in
that
crowd
had
i
only
returned
a
word
the
woman
whom
they
set
up
would
have
poured
filthy
abuse
on
they
shall
rue
the
day
that
they
uttered
the
words
thou
hast
repeated
madar
they
shall
wish
their
tongues
had
never
said
them
and
that
their
hearts
had
eaten
them
ere
they
had
birth
i
have
yet
power
and
can
crush
that
butterfly
whose
gay
bearing
is
only
for
a
season
not
and
who
is
this
proud
fool
he
continued
after
a
pause
to
madar
who
had
been
drinking
in
every
word
of
his
master
s
soliloquy
with
greedy
ears
and
rejoicing
in
the
hope
of
speedy
revenge
who
saidst
thou
he
is
a
patél
noble
sir
miserable
patél
of
a
village
alla
knows
where
man
whose
mother
inshalla
is
i
care
not
for
his
mother
is
he
and
how
comes
he
with
the
khan
tell
me
or
i
will
beat
thee
with
my
shoe
my
lord
not
angry
but
listen
he
is
the
patél
of
a
village
where
the
khan
and
his
young
wife
were
nearly
drowned
he
saved
the
lady
and
he
fought
afterwards
against
some
mahrattas
when
they
attacked
the
village
where
the
khan
was
resting
for
the
night
and
was
wounded
in
his
and
this
is
all
madar
it
is
protector
of
the
poor
it
is
all
they
say
the
patél
is
a
man
who
killed
fourteen
mahrattas
with
his
own
hand
bah
cried
jaffur
impatiently
and
thou
art
a
fool
to
believe
them
and
he
fell
to
musing
he
must
have
seen
her
face
he
said
at
length
aloud
he
must
echoed
his
attendant
they
say
he
carried
her
in
his
arms
from
the
khoob
and
what
said
they
of
her
beauty
that
she
is
as
fair
as
the
full
moon
in
the
night
of
khoob
and
he
has
seen
her
again
i
doubt
not
since
willa
alum
said
madar
raising
his
thumbs
to
his
ears
how
should
your
slave
know
but
it
is
likely
can
not
conceal
their
faces
when
they
are
no
nor
inshalla
wish
to
do
so
but
we
shall
see
care
that
you
mention
not
abroad
what
occurred
this
evening
will
forget
but
my
lord
will
not
i
never
forget
an
insult
till
i
have
had
its
exchange
and
that
thou
well
knowest
madar
begone
make
it
known
without
that
i
may
now
be
visited
we
will
consider
of
this
but
we
must
return
to
the
khan
whose
active
furashes
had
encircled
several
of
the
pillars
of
the
cloisters
with
high
tent
walls
swept
out
the
inclosures
thus
made
spread
the
carpets
and
converted
what
was
before
open
arches
and
naked
walls
and
floors
into
a
comfortable
apartment
perfectly
secure
from
observation
ameena
took
possession
of
it
and
was
soon
joined
by
her
lord
who
in
truth
was
in
nowise
sorry
after
the
fatigues
of
the
day
to
enjoy
first
a
good
dinner
and
afterwards
the
luxury
of
a
soft
cotton
mattress
and
to
have
his
limbs
gently
kneaded
by
the
tiny
hands
of
his
fair
wife
while
she
amused
him
with
a
fairy
tale
or
one
of
those
stories
of
intrigue
and
love
which
are
so
common
among
the
easterns
the
cool
air
of
the
mysore
country
had
apparently
invigorated
her
and
the
languor
which
the
heat
and
the
fatigue
of
constant
travelling
had
caused
in
the
carnatic
had
entirely
disappeared
and
given
place
to
her
usual
lively
and
joyous
expression
she
had
thrown
a
deep
shawl
with
a
very
border
around
her
to
protect
her
from
the
night
breeze
that
blew
chilly
over
the
tent
walls
which
did
not
reach
to
the
roof
of
the
building
they
were
in
and
it
fell
in
heavy
folds
around
her
appearing
to
make
her
light
figure
almost
more
slender
from
the
contrast
she
was
inexpressively
lovely
as
she
now
bent
playfully
over
the
khan
employed
in
her
novel
vocation
and
again
desisting
began
afresh
some
other
story
wherewith
to
beguile
the
time
till
the
hour
of
repose
arrived
alla
bless
thee
ameena
said
the
khan
after
one
of
her
lively
sallies
when
her
face
had
brightened
and
her
eyes
sparkled
at
some
point
of
her
tale
alla
bless
thee
thou
art
truly
lovely
the
prophet
may
his
name
be
honoured
could
have
seen
no
brighter
houris
in
paradise
when
the
will
of
alla
called
him
there
than
thou
i
am
my
lord
s
slave
said
the
lady
and
to
please
him
is
my
sole
endeavour
day
and
night
happy
is
my
heart
when
it
tells
me
i
have
much
more
when
i
am
honoured
with
such
a
remark
from
thine
own
lips
o
my
lord
and
as
to
my
beauty
here
she
threw
a
glance
into
the
little
mirror
she
wore
upon
her
thumb
my
lord
surely
flatters
me
he
must
have
seen
far
fairer
faces
than
never
never
by
the
prophet
cried
the
khan
with
energy
never
i
swear
by
thine
own
eyes
never
i
have
but
one
regret
ameena
and
that
can
not
be
mended
or
altered
ameena
s
heart
suddenly
failed
her
for
kasim
came
to
her
remembrance
and
she
thought
for
an
instant
that
he
might
suspect
regret
what
dost
thou
regret
she
asked
hesitatingly
anything
that
thy
poor
slave
hath
done
nothing
fairest
on
thy
part
it
was
for
her
heart
was
suddenly
relieved
of
a
load
for
thyself
she
said
gaily
what
dost
thou
regret
khan
sahib
that
i
am
not
twenty
years
younger
for
thy
sake
ameena
he
said
with
much
feeling
methinks
now
to
see
these
grey
hairs
and
this
grey
beard
and
he
touched
them
as
he
spoke
so
near
thy
soft
and
waving
tresses
i
seem
more
like
a
father
to
thee
than
a
husband
and
yet
thou
art
mine
ameena
i
would
thou
wert
older
fair
one
and
if
i
were
i
should
not
be
so
fair
she
said
artlessly
i
care
not
so
that
we
had
grown
old
together
at
least
i
should
have
seen
thy
beauty
and
the
remembrance
of
it
would
have
been
with
ameena
sighed
her
thoughts
wandered
to
kasim
s
noble
figure
and
youthful
yet
expressive
countenance
in
spite
of
herself
and
almost
unconsciously
she
drew
her
hand
across
her
eyes
as
if
to
shut
something
ideal
from
her
sight
the
khan
heard
her
sigh
he
would
rather
not
have
heard
it
though
his
own
remark
he
knew
had
provoked
it
i
have
said
the
truth
ameena
and
thou
wouldst
rather
i
were
a
younger
man
he
said
looking
at
her
intently
but
what
matter
these
idle
words
do
but
pain
thee
it
is
our
destiny
sweet
one
and
we
must
work
it
out
ay
it
is
our
destiny
she
said
the
will
of
alla
continued
the
khan
looking
up
devoutly
which
hath
joined
two
beings
together
so
unsuited
in
age
but
not
in
temper
i
think
ameena
thou
art
not
as
others
wilful
and
to
from
which
there
is
no
deliverance
but
a
sweet
and
lovely
flower
which
a
monarch
might
wear
in
his
heart
and
be
proud
of
so
thou
truly
art
to
rhyman
khan
and
ever
wilt
be
even
though
enemies
should
come
between
enemies
my
lord
she
said
with
surprise
in
her
tone
i
never
had
an
enemy
even
in
my
own
home
and
i
am
here
with
thee
in
a
strange
land
where
i
know
no
one
who
could
be
mine
enemy
may
alla
put
them
far
from
thee
fairest
he
replied
affectionately
and
yet
sometimes
i
fear
that
thou
mayst
have
to
encounter
i
have
heard
it
said
by
my
honoured
father
khan
that
as
the
blessed
prophet
had
many
enemies
and
as
the
martyrs
hassan
and
hoosein
came
to
their
sad
deaths
by
them
it
is
the
lot
of
all
to
have
some
one
inimical
but
he
meant
men
whose
occupations
and
cares
call
them
into
the
world
women
like
me
who
knowing
no
one
but
my
servants
can
not
make
enemies
of
them
if
i
am
but
i
mean
those
who
would
be
jealous
of
thy
beauty
and
seek
thus
to
injure
thee
these
i
alone
fear
replied
her
husband
i
fear
not
khan
she
said
simply
and
confidently
neither
for
thee
nor
myself
i
can
not
think
that
thou
couldst
ever
give
thy
ameena
cause
for
jealousy
or
any
one
else
cause
of
jealousy
of
her
alla
help
me
i
should
die
if
such
could
nay
there
thou
shalt
be
safe
he
said
interrupting
her
for
never
never
shalt
thou
have
cause
to
say
of
rhyman
khan
that
he
was
false
to
thee
i
am
a
soldier
and
one
whose
honour
has
known
neither
stain
nor
spot
and
he
had
stopped
suddenly
and
appeared
to
think
and
while
he
thought
suddenly
an
idea
flashed
into
her
mind
she
have
already
a
rival
she
could
not
bear
it
to
rest
there
for
an
instant
ere
she
threw
it
off
in
words
speak
o
khan
she
cried
thou
hast
none
but
me
who
claims
thy
love
thou
hast
not
belied
thyself
to
one
who
has
here
none
to
protect
her
but
thee
oh
my
lord
canst
not
have
deceived
the
child
who
trusted
thee
and
never
asked
of
thee
aught
she
was
very
excited
i
have
not
deceived
thee
ameena
but
i
have
not
told
thee
all
my
history
have
not
told
thee
as
yet
what
sooner
or
later
thou
must
know
i
have
not
told
thee
how
that
for
years
i
pined
for
the
love
of
woman
such
pure
love
as
thine
and
found
nought
after
a
short
intercourse
but
bitter
words
and
a
constant
seeking
after
wealth
which
i
had
not
to
bestow
i
have
had
to
bear
constant
upbraiding
from
those
out
of
whose
families
i
chose
them
because
i
would
not
spend
my
substance
upon
wasteful
parents
sons
whose
very
existence
was
a
disgrace
to
them
hadst
thou
known
this
ameena
thou
wouldst
not
marvel
that
i
sought
one
like
thee
in
a
distant
land
who
removed
from
every
tie
and
with
no
one
to
sow
dissension
between
us
should
learn
to
love
and
trust
rhyman
khan
as
inshalla
he
ought
to
be
loved
and
she
knew
not
how
to
reply
on
the
one
hand
the
concealment
of
other
ties
which
the
khan
had
kept
secret
so
long
and
now
revealed
so
unexpectedly
and
the
undefined
dread
of
the
hate
of
rivals
smote
her
to
the
very
heart
on
the
other
her
attention
was
powerfully
arrested
by
the
bold
truthfulness
of
his
disclosure
she
was
affected
by
the
picture
of
desolation
he
had
drawn
of
his
own
state
and
his
disappointments
and
she
was
soothed
to
think
that
all
he
had
sought
for
years
was
centred
in
her
she
was
silent
could
not
speak
under
such
conflicting
thoughts
thou
hast
not
told
me
all
she
said
at
length
thou
hast
not
said
how
she
could
not
finish
the
sentence
there
are
two
dearest
ameena
on
each
of
whom
i
fixed
hopes
which
have
been
broken
in
many
ways
i
have
never
had
a
child
to
bless
me
and
where
love
should
have
been
and
mildness
like
thine
to
compensate
for
such
a
disappointment
rancour
has
come
and
and
with
them
despair
to
me
of
that
quiet
peace
which
my
mind
seeks
when
war
and
its
perils
and
excitements
are
past
when
disappointment
came
with
the
first
i
thought
a
second
might
perchance
be
more
to
me
than
she
had
been
alas
i
soon
was
undeceived
and
bitterly
too
ameena
but
after
all
who
can
say
there
are
no
flowers
to
be
pulled
in
the
rugged
pathways
of
their
lives
had
this
not
happened
i
should
never
have
known
thee
my
rose
have
seen
that
look
of
pity
which
thy
beauteous
eyes
wear
now
it
is
from
these
i
fear
thou
wilt
have
to
bear
some
jealousies
some
enmity
and
canst
thou
brave
somewhat
for
the
love
of
rhyman
khan
continue
to
be
to
me
as
thou
art
now
and
my
wealth
my
power
nay
my
itself
are
thine
as
freely
as
thou
carest
to
use
them
now
thou
knowest
all
and
a
heavy
weight
is
gone
from
my
heart
which
had
long
abode
there
speak
thou
content
i
would
i
had
known
this
earlier
she
said
sadly
after
a
while
but
as
it
is
i
am
thankful
to
hear
it
even
now
my
lord
knows
well
that
i
am
but
a
child
and
no
match
for
the
intrigues
of
those
who
are
more
versed
in
the
world
s
wisdom
i
feel
that
it
has
saddened
and
sobered
me
and
where
i
had
hoped
in
my
bright
fancy
to
roam
as
i
listed
in
the
garden
of
thy
love
unchecked
and
unheeded
by
any
one
but
thyself
i
must
cover
myself
with
the
veil
of
discretion
and
deliberation
and
take
heed
to
my
steps
lest
i
fall
into
the
snares
which
jealousy
will
not
fail
to
place
for
alla
forbid
cried
the
khan
fervently
thou
hast
no
cause
to
fear
i
know
not
she
replied
but
i
can
scarcely
hope
that
there
may
be
friendship
between
me
and
those
whom
you
describe
there
may
be
a
show
for
a
while
but
the
end
will
be
and
the
poor
girl
wept
for
she
had
suddenly
been
disturbed
upon
her
height
of
security
or
at
all
events
of
unmolested
occupation
and
even
in
a
few
minutes
she
could
not
help
expecting
some
rude
collision
which
would
perhaps
cast
her
down
headlong
and
her
own
peaceful
freedom
from
care
its
loving
affection
its
harmless
so
vividly
to
her
mind
that
she
could
not
help
for
the
time
regretting
bitterly
that
she
had
left
it
to
endure
such
a
prospect
as
appeared
to
open
before
her
nor
did
the
khan
disturb
except
by
a
caress
or
a
word
of
cheerful
hope
the
thoughts
which
he
knew
must
be
passing
in
her
heart
but
to
which
he
could
not
respond
in
a
manner
to
make
her
forget
them
on
the
instant
they
must
have
their
vent
he
thought
and
thought
wisely
she
lay
down
and
wept
till
sleep
gradually
asserted
its
mastery
over
her
wearied
form
and
thoughts
she
shall
never
come
to
harm
so
help
me
alla
and
his
holy
prophet
said
the
khan
mentally
as
he
bent
over
her
and
gently
drew
some
covering
upon
her
without
disturbing
her
she
shall
never
know
harm
or
evil
as
long
as
the
arm
or
power
of
rhyman
khan
can
shield
her
she
still
sobs
he
said
as
every
now
and
then
a
sob
broke
softly
from
her
like
to
that
from
a
child
who
has
cried
itself
to
sleep
and
her
bosom
heaved
under
the
oppression
i
would
to
alla
i
had
not
caused
her
this
pain
and
yet
it
was
inevitable
their
jealousy
and
malice
will
be
great
i
know
and
their
power
is
great
but
inshalla
there
will
be
no
fear
of
their
machinations
and
i
will
soon
teach
her
to
despise
them
they
too
will
cease
to
use
them
when
they
see
them
of
no
avail
and
chapter
xiv
the
day
after
the
khan
s
risala
halted
at
bangalore
from
whence
it
was
ordered
to
escort
some
treasure
military
stores
and
many
english
prisoners
to
the
capital
the
khan
having
now
taken
the
command
he
was
enabled
to
employ
kasim
in
many
useful
offices
both
as
a
scribe
and
in
the
execution
of
his
orders
and
he
was
delighted
to
find
in
him
one
whom
he
could
trust
and
whose
advice
was
often
of
use
in
matters
that
perplexed
his
own
uninventive
mind
and
although
he
held
no
situation
as
yet
in
the
government
service
nor
was
enrolled
in
the
regiment
yet
he
gradually
became
looked
up
to
even
during
the
few
days
he
had
been
with
it
by
the
subordinate
officers
who
naturally
wished
to
curry
favour
with
one
so
much
in
association
with
their
chief
accordingly
kasim
was
courted
by
almost
and
made
much
of
some
indeed
regarded
him
with
jealousy
at
the
head
of
whom
was
the
person
we
have
already
named
jaffur
sahib
and
as
their
opinions
became
known
to
one
another
they
gradually
formed
a
party
which
though
its
numbers
were
small
made
up
for
that
deficiency
in
bitter
dislike
the
most
prominent
of
these
besides
jaffur
sahib
himself
was
the
chief
accountant
and
secretary
of
the
regiment
of
those
corrupt
and
wily
scoundrels
so
often
to
be
found
in
the
persons
of
those
who
have
been
educated
in
the
daily
observance
of
schemes
and
fraud
for
his
father
had
filled
a
high
situation
as
moonshee
or
secretary
near
the
person
of
hyder
ali
and
it
is
impossible
for
any
one
to
fill
a
similar
place
in
any
native
court
without
having
daily
opportunities
of
improvement
in
the
arts
of
intrigue
falsehood
and
corruption
he
was
also
a
constant
associate
of
jaffur
sahib
and
in
many
a
plan
for
cheating
the
government
by
false
musters
of
men
and
extra
charges
for
grain
and
forage
they
had
been
nearly
associated
had
divided
the
spoil
between
them
had
also
been
the
agent
for
the
supply
of
forage
and
other
necessaries
to
a
large
number
of
the
khan
s
horses
which
were
in
the
risala
and
as
he
seldom
looked
after
these
accounts
himself
there
had
been
a
very
handsome
profit
to
be
gained
from
them
by
the
subordinates
it
was
probable
that
upon
the
first
ground
is
so
far
as
the
regiment
was
and
the
moonshee
would
never
have
come
in
contact
with
each
other
but
they
were
not
long
in
doing
so
when
the
private
interests
of
the
khan
were
in
question
for
want
of
occupation
kasim
had
solicited
some
employment
from
the
khan
who
had
desired
him
to
look
after
his
own
horses
and
to
examine
the
accounts
the
moonshee
should
furnish
of
their
expenditure
and
for
this
office
kasim
was
well
fitted
not
only
from
his
knowledge
of
writing
but
from
his
experience
as
a
patél
of
the
prices
of
grain
and
forage
the
accounts
had
used
to
be
daily
submitted
to
the
khan
and
during
his
absence
they
had
accumulated
to
a
large
amount
occupied
in
other
duties
and
affairs
the
khan
could
not
afford
time
to
hear
them
read
and
gave
them
over
for
examination
to
his
young
friend
who
in
the
careful
scrutiny
he
made
of
them
and
his
readiness
in
comprehending
their
intricate
nature
convinced
the
moonshee
that
he
had
to
deal
with
a
person
of
no
ordinary
exactitude
and
ability
kasim
in
his
inspection
of
the
documents
had
much
occasion
to
suspect
that
the
rates
and
quantities
charged
were
far
greater
than
the
truth
but
he
did
not
dare
at
first
to
make
any
accusation
against
a
man
of
the
moonshee
s
apparent
probity
and
respectability
he
had
seen
enough
however
to
put
him
on
his
guard
for
the
future
and
there
was
soon
ample
reason
to
confirm
his
suspicions
that
all
was
not
as
fair
as
the
accounts
showed
while
they
were
at
bangalore
he
made
a
daily
memorandum
of
the
prices
of
grain
in
the
several
bazaars
and
inquiries
also
of
the
men
who
rode
the
khan
s
horses
in
the
regiment
and
of
the
grooms
also
as
to
the
quantities
used
and
on
comparing
them
with
the
memorandums
furnished
to
him
by
the
moonshee
the
deceit
was
too
flagrant
to
pass
unnoticed
accordingly
he
sought
that
worthy
and
without
any
accusation
ventured
to
point
out
some
inaccuracies
as
he
supposed
they
must
be
in
the
accounts
as
compared
with
the
market
rates
these
the
moonshee
tried
to
support
with
all
the
effrontery
he
was
able
to
muster
for
some
time
but
kasim
was
steady
and
in
the
end
triumphed
it
was
however
an
offence
which
rankled
deeply
in
the
moonshee
s
mind
and
in
an
evening
converse
with
his
friend
the
jemadar
he
alluded
to
the
matter
in
no
very
amiable
humour
things
have
come
to
a
pretty
pass
since
the
khan
has
brought
that
boy
with
him
said
he
indignantly
to
the
jemadar
when
they
were
alone
how
has
he
interfered
with
you
as
he
appears
to
wish
to
do
with
everyone
else
to
be
sure
he
seems
he
can
read
and
the
old
fool
without
thinking
about
it
gave
him
all
my
accounts
of
the
pagha
to
look
over
instead
of
signing
and
passing
them
at
and
he
no
nothing
in
them
alla
be
praised
so
that
there
is
a
good
round
sum
to
divide
between
us
but
he
evidently
suspected
the
rates
of
grain
which
believe
me
jemadar
you
put
too
not
a
whit
not
a
whit
since
we
have
got
the
but
i
say
it
was
for
it
led
the
young
prying
fellow
to
ask
the
prices
of
grain
in
the
bazaars
and
of
forage
too
and
as
it
seems
he
is
a
patél
he
knows
more
about
the
matter
than
we
do
ourselves
so
when
i
gave
him
the
accounts
he
showed
me
a
memorandum
of
every
day
s
nerrikh
and
began
comparing
it
as
simply
as
possible
with
the
account
and
showing
the
difference
by
the
prophet
i
could
have
struck
him
for
his
pretence
of
ingenuousness
and
his
seeming
unconsciousness
that
he
was
detecting
me
i
tried
to
bully
him
jemadar
sahib
and
said
i
had
eaten
the
khan
s
salt
longer
than
he
had
and
was
not
to
be
suspected
by
a
boy
but
it
would
not
do
he
told
me
not
to
be
angry
that
he
might
be
mistaken
and
that
he
would
show
the
accounts
to
the
khan
if
i
liked
but
this
you
know
would
not
have
answered
my
purpose
for
the
old
fellow
would
have
fired
up
in
a
footnote
rate
of
prices
and
what
did
you
do
you
surely
did
not
alter
them
why
what
else
could
i
do
jemadar
i
at
last
pretended
to
see
the
mistake
and
make
fresh
in
other
words
o
cowardly
fool
you
ate
dirt
you
allowed
him
to
obtain
a
mastery
over
you
which
you
will
never
regain
you
call
yourself
a
moonshee
man
of
letters
shame
on
you
i
say
to
allow
yourself
to
be
dictated
to
by
a
boy
had
i
a
beard
like
yours
i
would
cut
it
off
for
very
but
he
interposed
i
tell
thee
i
can
hear
nothing
i
know
this
will
not
end
fellow
s
prying
should
have
been
stopped
at
once
and
his
suspicions
will
never
rest
believe
me
till
he
has
found
out
the
whole
and
at
any
rate
we
shall
lose
we
shall
how
much
two
hundred
rupees
i
dare
alla
alla
so
much
and
the
worst
is
that
our
trade
is
i
fear
so
how
can
it
be
otherwise
as
he
observes
the
rates
could
you
get
him
to
take
the
accounts
himself
moonshee
sahib
we
might
find
him
out
ourselves
overcharging
in
a
few
days
and
so
they
would
fall
back
to
us
and
he
would
be
alla
knows
sighed
the
moonshee
at
any
rate
it
is
worth
trying
i
will
see
to
it
i
am
only
afraid
your
turn
will
come
i
ll
tell
you
what
naser
the
thought
is
not
to
be
borne
what
lose
my
monthly
gains
without
which
this
service
is
nothing
to
me
no
if
there
is
a
kasim
ali
patél
there
is
at
least
a
shekh
jaffur
jemadar
i
tell
thee
man
i
was
not
born
to
eat
dirt
at
his
hands
but
he
at
mine
and
if
i
can
not
see
into
the
depths
of
futurity
like
the
sultaun
may
his
name
be
honoured
yet
i
can
see
far
enough
to
behold
this
boy
s
disgrace
at
my
hands
dost
thou
my
hands
thou
shouldst
know
by
this
time
that
i
rarely
fail
of
my
may
alla
grant
it
said
the
moonshee
piously
i
tell
thee
he
continued
i
hated
him
from
the
first
because
i
found
he
would
stand
between
me
and
the
khan
he
abused
me
in
hearing
of
all
the
camp
those
words
have
gone
forth
among
the
men
and
as
i
look
in
their
faces
i
fancy
that
the
remembrance
of
them
comes
into
their
heart
and
that
they
exult
over
me
i
tell
thee
this
is
not
to
be
borne
and
i
will
have
an
exchange
for
it
or
i
will
see
why
dost
thou
understand
i
and
thou
must
aid
my
pen
with
my
advice
bah
thy
asked
for
it
who
wants
that
of
a
fool
who
could
not
defend
his
own
papers
when
i
have
occasion
for
thee
in
this
matter
i
will
tell
thee
and
see
that
thou
doest
it
my
lord
is
not
angry
with
his
poor
servant
said
the
moonshee
cringingly
i
have
good
cause
to
be
so
but
must
eat
my
vexation
for
the
present
go
you
have
your
he
mused
for
a
while
after
the
moonshee
had
left
him
and
then
called
to
madar
who
waited
without
have
you
discovered
anything
more
about
the
khan
s
wife
madar
he
asked
nothing
my
lord
except
that
she
is
very
that
you
said
before
nothing
between
her
and
the
patél
nothing
except
that
he
had
seen
that
too
you
told
me
does
he
see
her
now
willa
alum
was
the
reply
footnote
god
knows
it
would
be
as
well
for
us
if
he
shall
your
slave
try
to
effect
it
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
madar
you
might
contrive
something
i
tell
thee
i
hate
that
boy
more
and
more
it
is
only
this
moment
that
i
have
heard
from
moonshee
that
his
accounts
have
been
suspected
by
does
the
khan
know
of
it
no
not
as
yet
but
there
is
no
security
for
us
and
there
is
no
saying
what
may
happen
for
this
boy
holds
a
sword
over
i
understand
lord
will
trust
me
and
depend
on
it
that
sooner
or
later
i
find
a
way
of
helping
him
to
revenge
these
it
was
thus
to
screen
their
own
iniquity
of
which
they
were
conscious
that
these
schemes
were
being
undertaken
against
the
peace
of
two
individuals
who
had
never
harmed
any
of
the
plotters
and
in
the
course
of
our
history
we
shall
follow
them
to
their
conclusions
the
consciousness
of
his
own
evil
practices
and
corruption
as
regarded
the
public
service
made
the
jemadar
jealous
of
any
one
who
should
usurp
the
place
he
had
held
with
the
khan
not
because
the
khan
liked
him
but
because
being
indolent
by
nature
and
unacquainted
with
the
details
of
the
private
economy
of
his
risalas
the
khan
was
glad
enough
to
find
that
any
one
would
undertake
that
for
him
which
he
could
not
bring
his
mind
to
take
any
interest
in
or
indeed
to
understand
and
if
kasim
had
succeeded
in
detecting
the
moonshee
what
might
not
have
to
fear
whose
peculations
were
even
of
a
more
daring
nature
and
extended
to
the
men
the
horses
and
the
establishment
of
the
corps
the
jemadar
brooded
over
these
thoughts
incessantly
and
his
avaricious
and
miserly
spirit
could
as
ill
brook
the
idea
of
pecuniary
loss
as
his
proud
and
revengeful
heart
the
prospect
of
disgrace
and
the
insult
he
had
been
told
by
his
emissary
that
he
had
already
received
after
a
few
days
halt
at
bangalore
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
carriages
for
the
removal
of
the
english
prisoners
to
the
capital
and
the
collection
of
some
of
the
revenue
of
the
district
which
was
also
to
be
escorted
thither
the
morning
arrived
on
which
they
were
to
set
out
and
each
corps
was
drawn
up
in
front
of
the
mysore
gate
of
the
fortress
while
the
khan
attended
by
kasim
and
some
others
rode
into
it
in
order
to
receive
the
prisoners
and
the
khan
his
last
orders
from
the
governor
while
he
was
employed
in
his
audience
kasim
rode
hither
and
thither
observing
with
delight
the
impregnable
strength
of
the
fortress
cannon
the
arms
and
appearance
of
the
disciplined
garrison
and
the
few
french
soldiers
and
officers
who
were
lounging
about
he
had
never
before
seen
a
european
and
their
appearance
their
and
ungraceful
dress
inspired
him
with
no
very
exalted
idea
of
their
prowess
can
these
be
the
men
he
thought
to
whom
the
sultaun
trusts
instead
of
to
the
brave
hearts
and
sturdy
arms
of
the
men
of
islam
but
so
i
am
told
and
i
am
to
see
more
at
the
capital
well
it
is
strange
that
they
should
have
the
talents
for
such
contrivances
in
war
as
never
enter
into
our
hearts
our
only
defence
is
a
strong
arm
and
a
good
sword
and
shield
and
if
we
had
not
to
fight
against
the
english
kafirs
we
should
not
require
these
french
who
after
all
are
only
infidels
too
but
here
come
the
prisoners
i
suppose
he
added
as
a
few
soldiers
horse
and
foot
with
drawn
swords
advanced
from
behind
an
adjacent
wall
the
brave
kafirs
as
all
call
them
and
hate
them
because
they
are
so
brave
i
confess
i
do
not
and
only
because
they
are
the
sultaun
s
enemies
and
infidels
into
the
his
curiosity
was
raised
to
the
highest
pitch
to
see
these
unhappy
men
who
in
defiance
of
the
treaty
of
were
kept
in
the
fortresses
of
the
country
without
a
hope
of
deliverance
and
cut
off
from
any
chance
of
communication
with
their
countrymen
on
the
coast
among
the
few
with
whom
kasim
had
associated
the
english
were
the
continued
subject
of
conversation
their
religion
their
manners
and
their
persons
were
ridiculed
and
held
up
to
scorn
by
all
but
their
bravery
none
could
deny
and
that
man
held
himself
far
exalted
above
his
fellows
who
had
entered
into
personal
combat
with
or
slain
one
of
them
many
were
the
tales
then
in
circulation
exaggerations
of
reality
others
stern
scenes
of
hard
fighting
even
figurative
language
failed
to
exalt
above
their
due
estimation
in
company
with
the
khan
with
dilawur
ali
and
with
others
kasim
had
heard
many
of
these
relations
and
indeed
whenever
he
listened
in
the
camp
either
to
itinerant
or
to
those
gathered
around
a
watchfire
the
english
were
alike
the
theme
of
execration
for
their
religion
and
their
falsehood
or
on
rare
occasions
praised
for
their
devoted
bravery
no
wonder
then
was
it
that
he
watched
for
their
coming
with
very
eager
anxiety
figuring
to
himself
what
they
might
be
he
thought
to
have
seen
them
a
people
and
that
in
their
persons
he
should
realise
his
own
ideas
of
what
a
warrior
ought
to
be
and
finely
formed
haughty
in
appearance
with
an
eye
of
fire
and
an
arm
of
iron
one
by
one
the
prisoners
came
before
him
and
some
of
them
heavily
chained
others
free
but
all
men
on
whose
faces
the
rigour
of
captivity
had
set
its
seal
melancholy
and
pale
many
of
them
wasted
by
sickness
and
by
mental
and
bodily
sufferings
they
were
shadows
of
what
they
had
been
their
clothes
hung
in
rags
about
them
and
though
not
dirty
they
were
of
a
colour
which
proved
that
they
themselves
had
washed
them
from
time
to
time
a
few
of
them
had
uniform
coats
upon
them
whose
stained
and
discoloured
appearance
fitted
well
with
the
wretched
condition
of
their
wearers
their
step
was
slow
and
weak
and
those
who
wore
fetters
with
difficulty
moved
at
all
none
of
them
spoke
but
many
of
them
gazed
around
upon
the
walls
and
looked
up
into
the
bright
heavens
and
smiled
as
though
they
were
glad
that
motion
and
air
were
once
more
allowed
to
refresh
their
cramped
and
emaciated
limbs
and
weary
spirits
in
spite
of
his
previous
determination
to
hate
them
with
the
same
spirit
as
that
of
his
companions
kasim
felt
he
could
not
there
would
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
repress
it
arise
a
feeling
of
pity
that
men
whom
he
doubted
not
were
as
brave
as
the
race
was
represented
to
be
should
exhibit
so
sorrowful
an
appearance
which
told
a
forcible
tale
of
unalleviated
misery
following
those
on
foot
were
several
in
small
doolies
whose
emaciated
and
ghastly
looks
told
of
their
sickness
and
unfitness
for
removal
he
had
expected
a
feeling
of
triumph
to
arise
in
his
heart
as
he
should
behold
the
infidel
english
captives
but
there
was
something
so
touching
in
the
appearance
of
the
melancholy
procession
that
he
felt
none
he
could
much
rather
have
wept
as
he
looked
on
it
than
joined
in
any
expression
of
towards
the
prisoners
as
they
advanced
a
few
boys
who
were
near
hooted
the
captives
and
abused
them
in
obscene
language
this
they
did
not
appear
to
deign
to
notice
at
last
one
boy
more
bold
than
the
rest
took
up
a
stone
and
accompanying
it
with
a
savage
oath
flung
it
against
the
prisoner
nearest
to
him
and
having
struck
him
was
greeted
with
a
loud
shout
of
joy
by
his
companions
almost
ere
he
was
aware
of
his
own
intention
and
impelled
by
the
wanton
insult
upon
one
so
helpless
kasim
violently
urged
his
horse
across
the
open
space
up
to
the
having
been
successful
in
his
first
fling
had
picked
up
another
stone
with
a
similar
struck
him
severely
several
times
with
the
whip
he
had
in
his
hand
screaming
with
pain
the
boy
ran
off
to
a
distance
and
his
associates
terrified
at
the
punishment
their
companion
had
received
dispersed
at
once
kasim
could
not
resist
speaking
to
the
prisoner
on
whose
behalf
he
had
acted
and
riding
up
to
him
he
hoped
not
knowing
whether
he
should
be
understood
that
he
was
not
hurt
adding
that
he
had
punished
the
young
miscreant
who
had
thrown
the
stone
the
voice
was
one
of
kindness
and
it
was
long
since
one
like
it
had
sounded
in
the
young
englishman
s
ears
i
am
not
hurt
he
said
in
good
hindostanee
and
if
i
had
been
an
act
of
kindness
such
as
yours
would
have
amply
repaid
me
for
receiving
it
gallant
soldier
you
it
would
seem
have
not
been
taught
as
your
countrymen
to
hate
the
english
do
not
however
speak
to
me
an
act
of
courtesy
to
one
of
us
may
chance
to
bring
disgrace
upon
you
and
i
would
not
have
you
receive
that
return
for
your
kindness
may
god
protect
you
they
passed
on
and
kasim
remained
in
the
same
spot
gazing
after
him
his
tall
figure
and
proud
air
his
pale
but
handsome
face
and
blue
eyes
as
kasim
had
never
seen
before
fluent
speech
and
manly
tone
all
his
last
words
may
god
protect
you
affected
him
powerfully
god
protect
you
he
repeated
he
believes
then
in
alla
how
can
he
be
an
infidel
he
said
alla
hafiz
and
he
spoke
like
a
mussulman
why
should
he
be
hated
i
will
see
him
again
by
alla
such
a
man
is
worth
knowing
and
i
may
be
able
to
befriend
him
surely
he
is
a
man
of
but
here
his
surmises
were
put
an
end
to
by
dilawur
ali
who
riding
up
to
him
bade
him
accompany
him
for
the
khan
was
ready
to
proceed
then
you
saw
the
kafirs
their
end
be
perdition
said
the
rough
soldier
i
did
brother
returned
kasim
miserable
enough
they
look
and
as
if
they
could
hardly
move
how
are
they
to
travel
there
are
covered
carts
for
some
meer
sahib
for
they
can
not
bear
the
sun
for
others
who
are
weak
and
one
or
two
who
are
officers
i
hear
are
to
be
allowed
an
elephant
we
shall
and
they
rode
rapidly
through
the
gate
of
the
fort
i
thought
he
was
an
officer
exclaimed
kasim
i
thought
he
was
more
than
one
of
the
lower
rank
as
the
englishman
with
whom
he
had
spoken
was
desired
to
mount
an
elephant
which
bore
a
handsome
umbara
footnote
a
kind
of
howdah
why
what
know
you
of
him
nothing
but
i
spoke
a
few
words
to
him
and
it
struck
me
he
was
a
man
of
breeding
and
you
had
better
beware
kasim
said
his
companion
acts
may
be
misinterpreted
and
men
like
you
never
want
enemies
to
assist
others
in
thinking
ill
of
thank
you
for
your
advice
said
kasim
but
i
have
done
or
said
nothing
that
i
am
ashamed
kasim
afterwards
mentioned
what
he
had
done
to
the
khan
who
could
not
help
praising
the
young
soldier
s
action
by
the
prophet
well
done
he
cried
as
kasim
related
the
incident
i
am
glad
the
young
was
soundly
whipped
he
will
know
how
to
throw
stones
another
time
i
have
fought
against
the
feringhees
and
hate
them
and
yet
in
such
a
case
i
think
i
should
have
acted
as
thou
didst
kasim
hast
thou
spoken
to
the
feringhee
since
no
dilawur
ali
seemed
to
think
i
had
done
wrong
even
in
addressing
him
at
all
but
i
should
like
much
to
speak
with
him
they
say
he
is
a
sirdar
of
i
hear
he
has
accepted
the
sultaun
s
offer
of
pardon
and
that
he
will
serve
in
the
army
so
at
least
the
governor
of
the
fort
hoped
but
we
shall
see
i
doubt
it
for
the
feringhees
are
very
obstinate
and
tippoo
has
gained
over
none
as
yet
by
fair
then
there
are
some
in
the
army
a
few
only
who
have
been
honoured
with
the
rite
of
islam
but
they
are
of
the
lowest
grade
and
he
does
not
trust
them
go
you
then
when
we
have
pitched
the
camp
and
ask
this
feringhee
whether
he
will
serve
with
us
under
the
banner
of
the
lion
of
the
chapter
xv
kasim
hardly
need
be
desired
to
do
this
he
longed
to
have
some
amicable
conversation
with
one
who
had
already
excited
such
interest
in
his
heart
and
as
soon
as
possible
after
his
few
duties
were
discharged
he
went
to
the
tents
which
had
been
pitched
for
the
english
and
sought
out
his
acquaintance
they
met
with
pleasure
on
kasim
s
part
with
the
result
of
the
interest
he
had
felt
the
other
s
with
joy
that
among
so
many
enemies
there
was
one
from
whom
he
had
received
kindness
and
who
now
again
sought
him
i
little
thought
to
have
seen
you
again
said
the
officer
for
so
in
truth
he
was
and
this
visit
is
a
proof
to
me
that
we
are
not
no
certainly
said
kasim
i
have
no
enmity
towards
perhaps
then
you
can
inform
me
and
my
poor
comrades
why
we
are
being
removed
to
the
capital
to
us
it
is
you
are
to
enter
the
service
of
the
sultaun
we
hear
replied
kasim
and
from
the
flush
of
indignation
which
rose
in
the
other
s
pallid
face
he
could
see
how
that
idea
was
spurned
by
him
never
he
cried
never
and
the
sultaun
knows
this
full
well
months
nay
years
ago
he
offered
the
alternative
between
this
and
death
and
we
spurned
it
with
contempt
he
will
try
us
again
and
receive
the
same
answer
and
then
perhaps
he
may
relieve
us
by
death
from
this
imprisonment
which
is
then
it
has
been
severe
what
are
you
in
the
sultaun
s
service
and
know
not
of
our
condition
i
am
not
in
his
service
said
kasim
chance
threw
me
into
the
society
of
the
officer
with
whom
i
travel
to
the
city
i
may
enter
it
there
which
my
friend
wishes
me
to
do
if
it
can
be
effected
do
not
enter
it
i
beseech
you
cried
the
englishman
with
sudden
enthusiasm
with
so
tender
and
gallant
a
heart
thou
couldst
not
serve
one
who
is
a
tiger
in
nature
one
whose
glory
it
is
to
be
savage
and
merciless
as
his
namesake
rather
fly
from
hence
bear
these
letters
from
me
to
madras
will
ensure
thee
thou
choosest
to
ask
take
them
and
the
blessing
of
heaven
go
with
thee
thou
wilt
have
succoured
the
unfortunate
and
given
news
of
their
existence
to
many
who
have
long
ago
mourned
us
as
feringhee
said
kasim
earnestly
thy
gallant
bearing
has
won
my
regard
and
my
friendly
feeling
will
ever
be
towards
thee
but
i
abhor
thy
race
and
long
for
the
time
when
i
shall
strike
a
blow
against
them
in
fair
and
open
field
i
enter
the
service
of
the
sultaun
at
the
city
whither
we
go
and
this
is
answer
enough
to
thy
request
ask
me
not
therefore
to
do
what
i
should
be
ashamed
of
a
week
hence
i
will
speak
to
my
commander
about
thy
letters
and
doubt
not
that
they
will
be
the
only
gleam
of
hope
which
has
broken
on
me
for
years
has
again
faded
from
my
sight
said
the
young
officer
with
deep
melancholy
i
well
know
that
no
letters
will
be
forwarded
from
me
if
thy
master
or
he
who
will
be
so
has
denied
my
existence
and
broken
his
solemn
treaties
in
my
detention
and
that
of
the
other
poor
fellows
who
are
with
me
thinkest
thou
he
will
allow
me
to
write
word
that
i
am
here
and
is
it
so
said
kasim
i
believe
thee
thine
enemies
even
say
that
the
english
never
lie
if
it
be
possible
to
forward
thy
letters
i
will
do
it
and
ask
thee
far
them
and
now
farewell
if
kasim
ali
patél
can
ever
help
thee
ask
for
him
when
thou
art
in
trouble
or
danger
if
he
is
near
thee
he
will
do
his
utmost
in
thy
behalf
so
saying
kasim
left
him
and
returned
to
the
khan
i
thought
it
would
be
as
thou
hast
related
said
he
to
kasim
as
the
latter
detailed
the
conversation
such
a
man
is
neither
to
be
bribed
nor
threatened
even
their
bitterest
enemies
must
say
of
these
unbelievers
that
they
are
faithful
to
death
may
alla
help
him
for
i
fear
the
sultaun
s
displeasure
at
this
his
last
rejection
of
rank
and
service
may
be
fatal
to
him
and
to
the
rest
men
s
determinations
however
do
not
hold
out
always
with
the
fear
of
death
before
their
we
shall
see
whatever
is
written
in
his
destiny
he
must
ameen
said
kasim
i
pray
it
may
be
favourable
for
i
honour
him
though
he
is
a
on
the
fifth
day
afterwards
they
approached
the
city
kasim
with
delight
that
his
journey
was
ended
and
that
he
should
enter
on
his
service
without
delay
the
khan
with
mingled
feelings
of
joy
at
returning
to
his
master
and
his
old
companions
in
arms
and
of
vexation
at
the
thoughts
of
his
two
wives
and
the
reception
ameena
was
sure
to
meet
with
from
them
this
in
truth
was
a
source
of
the
most
lively
uneasiness
to
him
for
he
could
not
but
see
that
say
what
he
would
to
comfort
her
the
spirit
of
ameena
had
considerably
drooped
since
the
night
at
nundidroog
when
he
told
her
of
their
existence
still
he
hoped
the
best
and
he
said
to
himself
if
they
can
not
agree
i
shall
only
have
to
get
a
separate
house
and
live
away
from
behold
the
city
cried
many
an
one
of
those
who
led
the
force
as
on
reaching
the
brow
of
a
slight
eminence
the
broad
valley
of
the
river
cavery
burst
upon
them
in
the
centre
of
which
though
still
some
miles
distant
appeared
seringapatam
amidst
groves
of
trees
and
surrounded
by
lands
watered
by
the
river
not
much
of
the
fort
or
the
buildings
within
it
could
be
seen
but
the
tall
minarets
of
a
large
mosque
two
enormous
hindoo
pagodas
and
some
other
smaller
ones
and
the
roofs
of
the
palaces
appeared
above
the
trees
and
as
they
approached
nearer
the
walls
and
defences
of
the
fort
could
be
distinguished
from
the
ground
upon
which
it
was
built
passing
several
redoubts
which
commanded
the
road
they
reached
the
river
and
fording
its
uneven
and
rocky
channel
with
some
difficulty
they
continued
on
towards
the
fort
itself
whose
long
lines
of
rampart
high
walls
bastions
and
cavaliers
from
which
cannon
peeped
in
every
direction
filled
kasim
with
astonishment
and
delight
as
they
rode
onwards
through
the
bazaar
of
the
outer
town
they
saw
at
the
end
of
the
street
a
cavalcade
approaching
evidently
that
of
a
person
of
rank
a
number
of
spearmen
preceded
it
running
very
fast
and
shouting
the
titles
of
a
person
who
was
advancing
at
a
canter
followed
by
a
brilliant
group
clad
in
gorgeous
apparel
and
the
finest
muslins
and
many
in
which
glittered
brightly
in
the
sun
ere
kasim
could
ask
who
it
was
the
cortége
was
near
the
head
of
his
corps
which
drew
off
to
one
side
to
allow
it
to
pass
as
the
company
advanced
the
khan
dashed
his
heels
into
the
flanks
of
his
charger
and
flew
to
meet
it
kasim
saw
him
halt
suddenly
and
present
the
hilt
of
his
sword
to
one
who
from
his
appearance
and
the
humility
of
the
khan
s
attitude
he
felt
assured
could
be
no
other
than
the
sultaun
just
then
one
of
those
bulls
which
the
belief
of
the
hindoos
teaches
them
are
incarnations
of
divinity
and
which
roam
at
large
in
every
bazaar
happened
to
cross
the
road
lazily
before
the
royal
party
the
attendant
spearmen
strove
to
drive
it
on
but
not
accustomed
to
being
interfered
with
so
rudely
it
resisted
their
shouts
and
blows
with
the
of
their
spears
and
menaced
them
with
its
horns
there
ensued
some
little
noise
and
kasim
who
was
watching
the
sultaun
saw
him
observe
it
a
spear
a
spear
he
heard
him
cry
and
as
one
of
the
attendants
handed
him
one
he
exclaimed
to
his
suite
now
friends
for
a
hunt
yonder
fellow
menaces
us
by
the
prophet
who
will
strike
a
blow
for
islam
and
help
me
to
destroy
this
pet
of
the
idolaters
their
mothers
be
defiled
follow
me
and
so
saying
he
urged
his
noble
horse
onwards
the
bull
seeing
himself
pursued
turned
for
an
instant
with
the
intention
of
flight
but
it
was
too
late
as
it
turned
the
spear
of
the
sultaun
was
buried
in
its
side
and
it
staggered
on
the
blood
pouring
in
torrents
from
the
gaping
wound
while
it
bellowed
with
pain
one
or
two
of
the
attendants
followed
his
example
and
the
sultaun
continued
to
plunge
his
weapon
into
the
unresisting
animal
as
fast
as
he
could
draw
it
out
until
at
last
it
fell
groaning
heavily
having
only
run
a
few
yards
shabash
shabash
well
done
well
done
who
could
have
done
that
but
the
sultaun
inshalla
he
is
the
is
the
slayer
of
man
and
beast
is
the
brave
in
war
and
the
skilful
in
hunting
cried
all
the
attendants
and
courtiers
but
there
were
many
others
near
who
vented
their
hate
in
silent
yet
bitter
to
whom
the
slaughter
of
the
sacred
animal
was
impiety
not
to
be
surpassed
ha
cried
the
sultaun
looking
upon
the
group
one
of
whom
had
disgust
plainly
marked
upon
his
countenance
ha
thou
dost
not
like
this
by
the
soul
of
mahomed
we
will
make
thee
like
it
seize
me
that
fellow
furashes
he
cried
fiercely
and
smear
his
face
with
the
bull
s
blood
that
will
teach
him
to
look
with
an
evil
eye
on
his
monarch
s
the
order
was
obeyed
literally
and
ere
the
man
knew
what
was
said
he
was
seized
by
a
number
of
the
powerful
attendants
his
face
was
smeared
with
the
warm
blood
and
some
of
it
forced
into
his
mouth
enough
cried
the
sultaun
leaning
back
in
his
saddle
as
he
watched
the
scene
and
laughing
immoderately
pointed
to
the
really
ludicrous
but
disgusting
appearance
of
the
brahmin
who
covered
with
blood
and
dirt
was
vainly
striving
to
sputter
forth
the
abomination
which
had
been
forced
into
his
mouth
and
to
wipe
the
blood
from
his
face
enough
bring
him
before
us
now
make
a
lane
in
front
and
give
me
a
spear
away
with
thee
he
cried
to
the
brahmin
i
will
give
thee
a
fair
start
but
if
i
overtake
thee
before
yonder
turning
thou
art
a
dead
man
by
alla
the
man
turned
at
once
and
fled
with
the
utmost
speed
that
terror
could
lend
him
the
sultaun
waited
a
while
then
shouted
his
favourite
cry
of
alla
yar
and
followed
by
his
attendants
darted
at
full
speed
after
the
fugitive
the
brahmin
however
escaped
down
the
narrow
turning
and
the
brilliant
party
rode
on
laughing
heartily
at
their
amusement
kasim
watched
all
he
saw
with
disgust
for
though
a
mohamedan
and
a
sincere
one
he
had
never
heard
of
a
sacred
bull
being
destroyed
and
there
was
something
so
wanton
and
cruel
in
the
act
of
its
destruction
that
it
involuntarily
brought
to
his
memory
the
words
of
the
young
englishman
and
his
character
of
the
sultaun
but
he
had
not
time
for
much
reflection
for
the
corps
was
once
more
in
motion
and
he
became
absorbed
in
admiration
and
wonder
at
all
he
extent
and
wealth
of
the
crowds
of
numbers
of
soldiers
of
gallant
elephants
moving
to
and
beyond
all
the
fort
the
interior
of
which
he
now
longed
to
see
but
the
khan
turned
off
to
the
left
having
passed
the
town
and
after
riding
a
short
distance
they
entered
the
camp
without
the
walls
and
halted
within
its
precincts
leaving
kasim
with
his
tents
which
had
arrived
and
were
being
pitched
for
the
accommodation
of
ameena
the
khan
accompanied
only
by
his
servant
daood
rode
into
the
fort
to
his
own
house
in
order
to
break
the
news
of
his
marriage
to
his
wives
and
to
prepare
them
for
their
new
associate
there
is
sure
to
be
a
storm
he
said
and
it
may
as
well
burst
upon
me
at
alighting
therefore
at
the
door
where
he
was
welcomed
affectionately
by
his
servants
the
news
quickly
spread
through
the
house
that
the
khan
was
come
he
only
delayed
while
he
washed
his
feet
and
face
to
cleanse
them
from
the
dust
of
the
road
as
well
as
to
refresh
himself
a
little
ere
he
passed
on
into
the
zenana
the
two
ladies
who
had
expected
his
arrival
and
who
had
employed
a
person
abroad
to
inform
them
of
it
were
sitting
on
a
musnud
smoking
at
one
end
of
the
room
with
their
backs
to
the
door
as
he
entered
the
gurgling
of
their
hookas
became
doubly
loud
a
few
slave
girls
were
standing
about
the
apartment
who
made
low
salaams
as
he
approached
them
but
the
ladies
neither
rose
nor
took
the
slightest
notice
of
him
the
khan
was
surprised
at
seeing
them
together
as
when
he
had
left
them
they
were
bitter
enemies
and
he
stopped
suddenly
in
his
approach
it
was
evident
at
once
to
him
that
they
had
heard
of
his
marriage
and
made
common
cause
against
him
he
was
justly
enraged
at
this
and
at
the
want
of
respect
nay
insult
with
which
they
now
received
him
he
cried
women
do
ye
not
see
me
where
is
your
respect
how
dare
ye
sit
as
i
approach
am
i
a
man
or
am
i
less
than
a
dog
that
ye
take
no
more
notice
of
me
than
if
i
were
a
stone
speak
ye
ill
conditioned
cried
who
though
the
youngest
wife
was
the
and
who
led
the
reply
alla
alla
a
man
who
has
no
man
who
is
man
who
is
less
than
a
poor
pitiful
unblest
coward
yes
she
exclaimed
her
voice
rising
with
her
passion
as
she
proceeded
a
namurd
a
fellow
who
has
not
the
spirit
of
a
flea
to
dare
to
come
into
the
presence
of
women
who
inshalla
are
daughters
of
men
of
family
to
dare
to
approach
us
and
tell
us
that
he
has
come
and
brought
with
him
a
vile
hold
cried
the
khan
roused
to
fury
as
the
words
fell
on
his
ear
advancing
and
seizing
a
slipper
which
was
on
the
ground

it
was
early
in
the
fifth
month
after
herbert
compton
had
seen
the
shores
of
his
native
land
grow
dim
in
his
aching
sight
that
the
bold
western
coast
of
the
peninsula
of
india
met
the
earnest
and
watchful
gaze
of
all
who
were
assembled
upon
the
deck
of
the
noble
vessel
which
bore
them
over
the
blue
and
sparkling
sea
all
that
day
before
a
fresh
and
lively
breeze
the
ship
had
careered
onwards
to
her
haven
dashing
from
her
bows
the
white
and
hissing
foam
which
spread
itself
around
her
and
mingled
in
her
wake
while
startled
from
their
gambols
in
the
deep
many
a
shoal
of
sprightly
rising
from
under
the
very
bows
would
take
a
long
flight
to
leeward
and
disappear
within
the
limpid
breast
of
their
mother
ocean
above
the
sky
was
blue
and
without
a
cloud
to
dim
its
brightness
and
that
pureness
gave
to
the
sea
an
intensity
of
colour
which
is
unknown
save
where
those
cloudless
skies
exist
the
fresh
wind
had
curled
the
sea
into
graceful
waves
which
threw
their
white
crests
upwards
to
the
sky
as
they
broke
in
seeming
playfulness
or
rejoicing
in
their
gladness
away
through
the
glassy
depths
darted
the
gaudy
dolphin
and
merry
porpesse
now
chasing
each
other
with
many
an
eager
bound
now
in
a
shoal
together
leaping
far
above
the
crystal
billows
or
appearing
to
reach
the
summits
of
the
lucid
waves
and
as
they
broke
sinking
down
to
rest
for
an
instant
among
their
sparkling
foam
only
to
renew
the
sport
in
endless
variety
upon
others
scattered
around
them
was
the
fleet
some
vessels
near
others
far
distant
some
nearly
buried
under
the
load
of
canvas
which
was
stretched
to
court
the
under
a
less
quantity
gracefully
surmounting
every
wave
and
at
times
showing
their
brightly
coppered
sides
amongst
the
white
foam
in
which
they
were
encircled
they
were
like
living
beings
urging
their
way
over
the
bright
ocean
for
at
that
distance
no
human
form
could
be
distinctly
descried
upon
their
decks
and
their
rapid
progress
seemed
to
be
an
act
of
their
own
gigantic
power
land
land
on
the
lee
bow
was
the
joyful
cry
heard
towards
noon
from
the
land
was
by
all
on
deck
and
each
turned
to
congratulate
his
upon
the
happy
news
even
as
they
looked
a
wreath
of
white
smoke
burst
from
the
side
of
the
leading
frigate
and
mingled
with
the
blue
wave
while
with
the
report
which
followed
the
joyful
and
signal
of
land
flew
to
the
and
was
repeated
by
the
fleet
far
and
near
now
every
gaze
was
turned
from
the
deck
and
men
looked
with
straining
eyes
to
pierce
the
haze
of
the
horizon
as
if
the
land
lay
still
above
it
and
soon
there
appeared
a
darker
blue
outline
of
rugged
form
visible
for
a
while
to
an
unpractised
eye
it
was
only
that
of
a
mist
or
distant
cloud
but
it
became
gradually
firmer
and
more
decided
and
ere
an
hour
had
elapsed
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
land
of
their
land
in
which
many
were
to
to
suffer
privation
and
hardship
in
war
in
captivity
in
weary
which
few
were
destined
to
return
except
with
ruined
health
bronzed
features
and
altered
tempers
from
those
which
in
youth
and
ardent
hope
they
now
bore
with
them
few
however
had
thoughts
of
the
future
the
day
was
bright
and
joyful
and
as
they
neared
the
shore
it
appeared
to
smile
a
welcome
upon
them
the
naked
precipices
of
the
ghats
reared
themselves
out
of
the
dark
and
endless
forests
which
the
brilliant
sun
and
soft
warm
atmosphere
softened
with
tender
tints
and
as
many
a
one
longed
to
roam
far
away
among
those
recesses
little
thought
they
how
there
lurked
the
demon
of
deadly
fever
who
would
have
smitten
them
with
death
had
they
ventured
to
intrude
upon
his
solitary
except
to
the
wild
elephant
the
bison
the
bear
and
the
serpent
which
roamed
unmolested
everywhere
and
shared
it
with
him
as
they
neared
the
coast
many
a
white
sail
of
picturesque
form
could
be
seen
gliding
along
it
others
issuing
from
little
harbours
and
creeks
whose
shores
were
clothed
with
groves
of
tall
which
all
had
heard
of
but
none
as
yet
had
seen
as
the
fleet
was
descried
from
the
shore
little
boats
shot
out
spreading
their
wide
sails
and
as
they
neared
the
ships
became
objects
of
intense
interest
they
would
now
first
see
a
native
of
that
noble
hindoo
one
who
worshipped
idols
whose
faith
and
manners
had
been
undisturbed
for
ages
while
in
the
west
had
spread
new
faiths
new
systems
where
everything
was
daily
advancing
in
civilisation
fearlessly
did
the
tiny
boat
advance
upon
the
ship
giving
a
signal
for
a
rope
and
as
it
was
thrown
one
of
its
crew
leaped
into
the
chains
and
was
on
deck
in
a
object
of
wonder
and
admiration
to
those
who
for
the
first
time
beheld
him
tall
and
finely
formed
his
figure
was
a
model
of
symmetry
his
eyes
large
and
lustrous
his
features
regular
and
amiable
in
expression
his
body
naked
except
a
white
cloth
around
his
loins
and
a
small
cap
upon
his
head
quilted
in
curious
patterns
he
had
brought
fish
he
said
to
those
who
from
having
made
a
few
voyages
had
picked
up
some
few
words
of
his
native
tongue
and
had
a
few
plantains
some
eggs
and
butter
vegetables
of
the
country
and
sour
delicious
luxuries
to
those
who
had
long
been
confined
to
the
usual
shipboard
fare
with
dry
biscuit
soon
his
stock
was
disposed
of
and
descending
the
side
the
rope
was
cast
off
and
once
more
his
little
barque
danced
over
the
sparkling
waves
towards
the
shore
they
were
yet
far
from
bombay
and
as
evening
approached
the
and
requisite
flags
warned
the
fleet
to
take
in
sail
and
stand
out
to
some
distance
from
the
shore
the
sun
went
down
in
glory
as
he
descended
a
few
light
clouds
formed
about
him
and
the
wind
dropped
to
a
gentle
whispering
breeze
but
just
enough
to
fill
the
sails
and
the
fleet
glided
onwards
in
quietness
as
the
sun
sank
the
heavens
became
one
mass
of
gold
almost
too
brilliant
to
look
upon
and
the
clouds
tinged
with
reddish
tints
could
only
be
distinguished
by
the
dazzling
colours
of
their
edges
at
last
it
disappeared
into
a
sea
of
waving
restless
molten
gold
and
as
the
waters
gradually
and
lingeringly
gave
up
their
brightness
and
the
beams
of
light
faded
from
the
sails
of
the
ships
the
heavens
became
a
mass
of
most
gorgeous
and
gold
and
purple
fading
into
dim
greenish
yellows
and
tender
violet
tints
on
each
side
which
as
the
mind
strove
to
remember
them
for
ever
and
the
eye
to
fix
them
there
but
appeared
for
a
while
then
faded
away
and
were
no
more
seen
gradually
but
swiftly
night
clothed
all
objects
in
gloom
and
the
horizon
and
sky
appeared
to
blend
into
one
except
in
the
west
where
so
long
as
light
remained
its
restless
and
form
showed
against
the
last
lingering
light
of
day
for
a
while
all
watched
the
beauty
of
the
heavens
spangled
with
stars
and
fanned
by
a
gentle
and
cool
wind
which
blowing
from
the
shore
brought
with
it
they
fancied
perfumes
of
flowers
such
as
those
with
which
they
could
imagine
nature
in
her
profusion
had
decked
the
land
of
which
they
had
had
a
transient
yet
exquisite
glimpse
then
one
by
one
they
dropped
the
cheerful
converse
into
which
they
had
fallen
in
groups
and
as
the
night
advanced
sank
into
gentle
slumbers
rocked
by
the
easy
motion
of
their
vessel
dream
of
the
glories
which
the
coming
morrow
pictured
to
their
excited
imaginations
or
of
a
home
humble
perhaps
but
endeared
by
a
thousand
remembrances
of
love
of
parental
affection
of
wandering
in
cool
and
shady
places
beside
streams
whose
murmurings
sounded
gently
in
their
ears
herbert
s
were
thus
a
feverish
vision
of
palaces
amidst
gardens
where
the
graceful
and
acacia
waved
over
fountains
which
played
unceasingly
and
threw
up
a
soft
and
almost
noiseless
spray
into
the
air
and
where
he
wandered
amidst
forms
clad
in
such
oriental
garbs
as
his
fancy
supplied
gorgeous
and
dazzling
with
gold
and
faded
from
him
and
was
succeeded
by
one
of
peaceful
delight
he
seemed
to
wander
once
more
with
amy
amidst
the
green
and
mossy
glades
of
beechwood
again
the
path
beside
the
stream
was
threaded
arm
was
around
her
and
the
familiar
converse
they
had
held
sounded
in
his
ears
and
question
even
as
they
had
uttered
them
together
he
had
drawn
her
closer
and
closer
to
him
as
they
proceeded
and
as
he
strained
her
to
his
heart
in
one
long
and
ardent
embrace
he
thought
the
murmur
of
the
stream
was
louder
and
he
awoke
was
only
the
ceaseless
splash
of
the
waters
against
the
vessel
s
side
which
came
audibly
to
him
through
his
open
and
which
at
once
dispelled
the
illusion
but
he
composed
himself
again
to
endeavour
to
recall
the
fleeting
vision
to
hear
again
the
words
of
ideal
converse
to
hold
in
thrilling
embrace
the
loved
form
which
only
then
had
been
present
with
him
vain
and
futile
effort
and
strange
power
of
dreams
which
enables
us
often
to
hold
communings
with
those
thousands
of
miles
intervene
how
strongly
does
the
mind
in
such
moments
supply
the
thoughts
and
words
of
two
amid
scenes
sometimes
familiar
more
often
ideal
and
yet
palpable
in
sleep
but
dissipated
by
waking
fancy
and
often
leaving
no
traces
of
their
existence
upon
the
memory
but
a
confused
phantasy
which
imagination
strives
to
embody
in
vain
herbert
lay
restless
for
a
while
and
failing
of
his
purpose
he
roused
himself
looked
out
over
the
waters
which
glistened
faintly
under
the
rays
of
a
waning
moon
and
feeling
the
air
to
be
fresh
as
though
it
were
near
the
dawn
he
arose
dressed
himself
and
went
on
deck
in
order
to
watch
for
the
first
break
of
morning
over
the
land
they
were
approaching
the
scattered
ships
had
approached
each
other
during
the
night
and
stood
on
under
easy
sail
dreamy
they
looked
as
giant
spectres
walking
over
the
deep
there
were
some
from
whose
white
sails
the
moon
s
faint
light
was
reflected
and
which
glistened
under
her
beams
others
dark
and
deeply
in
shadow
showing
no
token
of
the
busy
life
which
existed
within
or
the
watchful
care
which
guided
them
onwards
gradually
a
faint
gleam
shot
up
into
the
eastern
sky
a
paler
colour
than
the
deep
blue
which
had
previously
existed
it
increased
and
the
lustre
of
the
stars
was
dimmed
soon
as
all
gazed
to
welcome
it
a
blush
of
pink
succeeded
and
as
the
day
sprang
into
existence
the
frigate
s
boomed
over
the
quiet
sea
the
joyous
day
grew
into
being
rapidly
hues
of
golden
of
crimson
flashed
upwards
and
spread
themselves
over
the
sky
revealing
by
degrees
the
long
and
broken
line
of
mountains
which
in
parts
obscured
by
the
mists
floating
upon
them
and
again
clear
and
sharp
against
the
brilliant
sky
continued
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
from
north
to
south
light
mists
covered
the
coast
and
the
foot
of
the
mountains
and
concealed
both
from
their
longing
gaze
but
as
the
sun
arose
in
dazzling
brilliancy
and
the
red
blush
of
his
morning
beams
rested
upon
the
ships
the
sea
the
mountain
peaks
and
naked
precipices
the
clouds
seemed
gradually
to
rise
from
their
slumber
until
broken
by
his
power
they
floated
upwards
slowly
as
if
nature
were
purposely
lifting
her
veil
from
the
scene
and
revealing
her
beauties
by
degrees
they
were
soon
at
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
of
bombay
the
islands
which
guard
it
rose
like
fairy
creations
from
the
breast
of
the
ocean
wooded
and
smiling
under
the
light
of
the
sun
away
to
the
right
were
the
noble
range
of
ghats
peaked
and
broken
summits
presenting
forms
strange
to
eyes
used
only
to
the
green
and
swelling
eminences
of
verdant
england
the
grounds
below
them
were
covered
with
everlasting
forests
and
the
shore
lined
by
groves
of
palms
from
among
which
peeped
many
a
white
temple
with
conical
roof
or
mosque
with
slender
minarets
before
them
stretched
out
the
magnificent
harbour
studded
with
bold
and
lofty
islands
among
which
the
mysterious
elephanta
and
gloomy
carinjah
reared
their
giant
forms
and
wooded
sides
bounded
by
the
town
and
fort
of
bombay
which
arose
from
the
water
s
edge
and
whose
white
and
terraced
houses
and
noble
fortifications
gleamed
brightly
in
the
sunlight
many
a
tall
ship
lay
there
resting
from
her
travel
over
the
deep
and
craft
of
every
description
shot
here
and
there
over
the
waters
an
arab
dhow
with
her
high
and
pointed
stern
the
pavilion
upon
it
gaily
decks
crowded
with
men
clad
in
the
loose
robes
and
heavy
turbans
of

her
huge
square
sail
set
to
catch
the
near
them
many
pattamars
with
their
lateen
sails
as
white
as
snow
mingled
with
the
fleet
while
others
of
smaller
size
could
be
seen
stretching
across
the
harbour
from
the
mahratta
continent
bearing
their
daily
supplies
of
market
produce
for
the
populous
town
it
was
a
scene
of
novel
yet
exquisite
beauty
and
lighted
up
by
the
powerful
beams
of
an
eastern
sun
could
not
fail
of
making
a
lasting
impression
upon
those
who
after
their
weary
voyage
saw
their
eastern
home
burst
upon
them
in
such
splendour
nor
was
there
one
of
all
the
numerous
host
contained
in
those
vessels
who
could
look
upon
it
without
feelings
of
mingled
emotion
from
the
general
who
commanded
remembering
the
brilliant
career
which
others
had
run

in
the
coming

to
win
fame
and

imagination
revelled
in
fancied
scenes
of
excitement

removed
from
his
ordinary
dull
routine
of
duty
or
of
dissipation
which
the
cold
climate
of
england
could
not
afford
were
excited
far
beyond
their
usual
wont
and
exclamations
of
surprise
of
wonder
or
of
gratification
as
things
new
or
beautiful
or
strange
passed
under
their
observation

from
the
various
groups
upon
the
deck
herbert
compton
had
left
england
without
contracting
a
particular
friendship
for
any
of
his
brother
officers
his
close
connection
and
constant
intercourse
with
his
own
family
and
latterly
his
attachment
had
prevented
this
but
he
had
not
the
less
observed
a
cheerful
and
friendly
intercourse
with
all
he
was
pained
however
to
see
how
during
the
voyage
and
the
constant
and
unrestricted
intercourse
of
which
the
space
of
a
vessel
was
naturally
productive
many
of
them
showed
tempers
and
dispositions
which
debarred
him
from
joining
in
such
intimate
association
as
their
absence
from
home
and
residence
in
a
foreign
land
ought
to
have
engendered
he
was
grieved
to
see
also
how
some
gave
themselves
up
to
intemperance
as
if
to
drown
in
wine
the
memory
of
things
they
should
have
held
most
dear
others
betook
themselves
to
cards
or
dice
to
pass
away
the
monotonous
hours
of
their
long
voyage
how
these
and
other
vices
had
already
changed
many
whom
he
had
at
first
been
inclined
to
esteem
sincerely
and
forced
him
to
contract
gradually
the
association
which
he
fain
would
have
had
intimate
and
general
but
there
were
nevertheless
two
with
whom
though
his
intercourse
had
been
slight
at
first
yet
it
had
steadily
progressed
and
who
returned
his
advances
towards
a
sincere
and
unreserved
friendship
with
corresponding
warmth
one
philip
dalton
was
his
equal
in
rank
and
slightly
his
senior
in
age
and
in
the
regiment
the
other
charles
balfour
his
ensign
a
youth
even
younger
than
himself
a
fair
and
sprightly
fellow
whose
joyous
spirit
nothing
could
daunt
and
over
whom
care
had
not
as
yet
flung
even
a
shadow
of
her
sobering
mantle
dalton
was
grave
and
religious
it
might
be
even
tinctured
with
superstition
at
least
with
a
belief
in
destiny
and
while
his
spirit
recoiled
at
once
from
those
thoughtless
or
vicious
companions
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
whom
he
shunned
the
more
as
he
perceived
the
uncontrolled
licence
they
were
prepared
to
give
to
their
passions
upon
landing
and
whose
only
conversation
consisted
in
the
prospects
of
indulgence
which
were
opening
upon
them
soon
grew
into
intimate
association
with
herbert
as
well
from
a
similarity
of
tastes
and
disgust
of
the
others
wild
revelry
as
from
seeing
at
once
that
he
possessed
a
deep
religious
feeling
and
gave
expression
to
his
sincere
thoughts
upon
the
subject
when
it
was
openly
ridiculed
or
sneered
at
among
the
others
the
three
were
standing
in
a
group
by
themselves
and
herbert
s
busy
and
skilful
pencil
was
rapidly
sketching
outlines
of
the
mountains
and
views
of
the
harbour
as
they
successively
presented
themselves
with
the
new
and
curious
forms
of
the
boats
and
vessels
around
them
i
envy
you
that
talent
herbert
said
dalton
how
valuable
it
would
be
to
me
who
feel
that
i
shall
so
lack
occupation
that
the
time
will
often
hang
heavy
on
my
hands
and
how
gratifying
to
those
we
love
to
send
them
even
scraps
of
scenes
in
which
we
live
and
move
nay
philip
you
have
never
tried
to
use
your
pencil
i
would
have
given
you
fifty
lessons
while
we
have
been
on
board
but
you
have
never
expressed
the
wish
here
is
charles
who
is
already
a
tolerable
proficient
and
who
sketches
with
most
meritorious
it
is
well
for
him
herbert
it
will
help
to
keep
him
from
vicious
and
corrupt
society
and
on
his
return
to
our
dear
england
you
will
both
have
the
pleasure
of
comparing
your
graphic
notes
and
talking
over
these
beautiful
scenes
together
but
with
me
it
is
different
i
feel
even
now
that
yonder
glorious
land
will
be
my
grave
that
the
name
of
philip
dalton
will
live
only
for
a
while
and
that
some
fatal
shot
or
deadly
fever
will
free
me
from
this
earthly
nonsense
philip
cried
both
at
once
why
should
you
be
so
gloomy
amidst
so
bright
and
joyous
a
scene
as
for
me
continued
balfour
i
intend
to
defy
and
to
become
a
major
or
a
colonel
at
least
to
serve
my
time
out
here
and
then
go
home
and
marry
some
one
i
don
t
intend
to
get
bilious
or
brown
or
ugly
but
to
keep
my
own
tolerable
looks
for
ten
years
at
all
events
that
bright
land
is
an
earnest
to
me
of
success
and
as
it
now
smiles
upon
us
a
hearty
welcome
so
do
i
feel
my
spirits
rise
within
me
proportionately
why
should
i
forbid
them
ay
why
should
you
charles
said
dalton
i
would
that
mine
were
as
light
as
yours
but
they
are
not
so
nor
ever
have
been
and
i
am
thankful
too
for
this
for
i
have
been
led
to
think
more
deeply
of
serious
matters
than
i
otherwise
should
have
done
and
thus
in
some
degree
to
prepare
for
the
change
which
must
soon
come
to
me
your
career
will
i
hope
be
very
different
and
i
trust
that
your
own
bright
hopes
will
be
fulfilled
but
remember
that
though
the
sky
and
land
are
bright
and
fair
fairer
than
our
england
yet
death
strikes
many
more
of
our
race
here
than
there
and
that
we
have
to
encounter
dangers
in
the
and
brave
that
we
had
need
to
be
prepared
whenever
the
blow
comes
either
by
a
shot
upon
the
or
by
the
slower
but
equally
fatal
disease
is
it
not
so
herbert
it
is
philip
and
yet
i
would
not
allow
were
i
you
such
dismal
phantasies
and
thoughts
to
possess
me
surely
when
god
has
thrown
around
us
such
beauties
as
these
our
hearts
should
bid
us
rejoice
and
enjoy
them
as
they
are
sent
and
we
ought
not
to
think
gloomily
upon
the
future
which
may
lead
us
insensibly
into
discontent
and
repining
let
us
only
continue
this
our
unreserved
and
sincere
friendship
whatever
may
be
our
position
and
i
feel
confident
that
we
possess
in
it
the
elements
of
much
happiness
perhaps
of
mutual
assistance
in
many
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
i
promise
it
herbert
cried
dalton
and
he
was
followed
with
equal
enthusiasm
by
balfour
there
will
arise
many
adverse
parties
in
the
regiment
i
foresee
but
we
need
know
none
singly
we
might
be
obliged
to
belong
to
one
or
we
may
be
thought
singular
but
we
are
safe
and
i
for
one
am
ready
to
brave
all
obloquy
on
this
score
in
your
then
we
are
agreed
philip
said
herbert
if
it
be
possible
we
will
live
together
it
will
take
some
time
perhaps
to
arrange
this
but
if
it
can
be
done
are
you
willing
and
you
charles
certainly
there
is
nothing
i
should
like
better
than
to
be
near
you
both
always
for
i
feel
that
my
wild
spirits
might
lead
me
to
do
things
in
company
with
many
of
the
rest
who
are
very
pleasant
fellows
that
i
should
feel
ashamed
of
this
is
then
a
happy
termination
to
our
voyage
said
herbert
one
unlooked
for
at
its
commencement
one
which
already
is
a
comfort
to
me
for
i
am
assured
that
whether
we
are
safe
in
barracks
or
in
the
danger
of
service
in
action
or
in
sickness
we
shall
be
much
to
one
another
and
that
we
shall
have
always
some
one
near
us
on
whom
we
can
rely
in
any
i
confess
that
many
of
my
gloomy
thoughts
have
passed
away
already
said
philip
but
let
us
for
the
present
keep
our
own
counsel
lest
we
be
denounced
as
a
party
even
before
we
go
on
shore
there
your
sketch
will
do
herbert
it
is
capital
and
now
put
up
your
book
for
i
suspect
we
are
not
far
from
our
anchorage
as
the
frigates
are
shortening
sail
at
any
rate
you
should
look
about
they
had
sailed
gradually
on
under
the
light
morning
breeze
which
was
fast
falling
and
hardly
served
to
carry
them
to
their
but
still
they
moved
and
thus
the
enjoyment
they
felt
at
the
novelty
of
the
scene
around
them
was
insensibly
prolonged
the
fleet
had
now
all
drawn
together
and
many
greetings
were
exchanged
between
friends
on
board
different
vessels
who
had
been
unavoidably
separated
during
the
voyage
the
ships
one
by
one
shortened
sail
and
as
they
watched
with
anxiety
the
movements
of
the
leading
frigate
they
heard
at
last
the
splash
of
her
anchor
as
it
plunged
from
her
bows
simultaneously
a
wreath
of
smoke
burst
from
her
sides
and
the
first
gun
of
her
cheering
salute
awoke
the
echoes
of
the
islands
and
shores
of
the
harbour
ere
it
was
finished
her
sails
were
furled
and
she
lay
peacefully
upon
the
smooth
water
a
thing
of
life
seemingly
enjoying
rest
after
her
long
and
ceaseless
travel
her
consort
followed
her
the
ships
of
the
fleet
in
rotation
and
the
fort
and
vessels
in
the
harbour
saluted
in
return
a
joyful
earnest
of
a
hearty
welcome
many
a
telescope
was
directed
to
the
crowds
of
people
who
lined
the
shores
the
piers
and
the
fortifications
and
many
were
the
speculations
upon
their
varied
appearance
and
costumes
all
at
that
distance
appeared
bright
and
clean
and
cheerful
and
the
inmates
of
the
vessels
longed
fervently
to
set
foot
upon
the
land
once
more
as
they
anchored
each
ship
became
surrounded
by
boats
and
the
shrill
cries
of
vendors
of
fruit
vegetables
fresh
bread
with
eggs
and
other
refreshments
resounded
on
all
sides
din
which
almost
bewildered
them
their
turn
came
to
be
visited
by
the
from
shore
their
men
were
paraded
and
each
company
headed
by
its
officer
was
inspected
they
were
shocked
by
the
appearance
of
their
and
if
disease
of
the
worst
kind
possessed
them
they
seemed
more
like
men
who
had
just
arisen
from
their
than
any
in
active
performance
of
very
onerous
and
fatiguing
duties
to
this
must
we
come
you
see
charles
said
philip
dalton
as
the
having
inspected
his
company
and
complimented
him
upon
its
appearance
passed
on
to
another
pale
faces
looks
seem
to
be
the
lot
of
all
here
who
attain
to
blue
coats
cocked
hats
and
plumes
it
was
but
just
now
that
you
said
you
preserve
yours
in
spite
of
all
climate
you
see
the
result
of
time
and
hot
weather
better
than
i
can
tell
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
it
said
charles
but
surely
all
can
not
be
so
philip
however
we
shall
see
when
we
get
ashore
when
are
we
to
land
this
evening
i
believe
they
are
preparing
our
barracks
for
us
till
then
we
must
admire
at
a
more
than
we
shall
on
shore
i
daresay
said
his
companion
and
so
indeed
it
proved
the
landing
in
the
close

evening

through

fort
over
the
dusty
roads
aspect
of
the
narrow
streets
and
oddly
fashioned
houses

the
flies
the
smells
of
various
kinds
some
not
the
most
fragrant
that
of
fish
under
the
process
of
drying
discomfort
of
their
first
night
on
shore
passed
in
beds
but
ill
adapted
to
defy
the
attacks
of
their
bitter
foes
the
musquitoes
completely
dispelled
all
the
romance
which
they
had
hoped
would
be
attendant
on
a
landing
in
the
gorgeous
east
but
which
they
discovered
with
no
small
chagrin
existed
only
in
their
imaginations
all
their
beautiful
gardens
and
gilded
palaces
their
luxurious
couches
and
airy
fountains
had
passed
away
and
given
place
to
the
bare
and
dull
reality
of
a
not
half
so
comfortable
they
thought
as
their
old
quarters
in
england
to
which
many
of
their
thoughts
wandered
painfully
chapter
xvii
gradually
however
all
became
more
and
more
indifferent
to
these
discomforts
and
the
few
days
which
passed
in
the
barracks
previous
to
their
second
embarkation
were
as
fully
occupied
as
soldiers
time
usually
is
when
preparations
for
service
and
that
too
of
an
active
and
kind
are
undertaken
the
close
of
the
year
had
brought
with
it
an
event
of
the
most
important
magnitude
to
the
british
interests
in
india
when
madras
was
in
a
state
of
famine
its
treasury
exhausted
and
its
means
even
of
defence
at
the
lowest
ebb
hyder
ali
the
most
formidable
and
untiring
foe
the
english
had
ever
known
constantly
victorious
over
the
armies
of
the
southern
presidency
and
holding
a
position
which
in
case
of
a
successful
blow
early
in
the
next
campaign
would
render
him
master
of
the
field
died
at
chittoor
the
relief
which
this
event
gave
to
the
minds
of
the
public
functionaries
in
the
south
was
great
and
a
blow
upon
the
army
which
had
obeyed
hyder
might
have
been
struck
with
advantage
in
the
absence
of
any
leader
on
whom
it
could
have
relied
that
opportunity
however
was
allowed
to
pass
tippoo
the
enterprising
son
of
the
deceased
chief
was
enabled
to
join
it
and
he
assumed
the
command
and
inheritance
of
his
father
s
dominions
without
amidst
the
rejoicings
of
his
future
subjects
he
had
been
employed
in
directing
a
successful
opposition
to
the
british
invasion
of
his
dominions
from
the
westward
which
had
made
much
progress
and
he
had
nearly
succeeded
in
his
object
when
the
news
of
his
father
s
death
was
secretly
conveyed
to
him
in
order
now
to
establish
his
authority
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
cross
the
peninsula
and
proceed
at
once
to
chittoor
where
his
father
had
died
and
where
the
army
lay
this
absence
from
his
command
which
was
longer
protracted
than
the
invaders
had
calculated
upon
gave
them
renewed
courage
and
the
war
against
the
mysore
dominions
was
prosecuted
by
the
bombay
force
with
a
vigour
and
success
which
had
long
been
strangers
to
the
operations
of
the
english
during
the
time
which
tippoo
necessarily
consumed
in
consolidating
his
authority
in
the
eastern
part
of
his
dominions
and
providing
for
the
invasion
there
menaced
by
the
force
of
the
madras
presidency
the
bombay
army
which
had
been
driven
by
him
into
the
fort
of
paniané
had
received
reinforcements
and
in
return
was
enabled
to
beat
back
its
assailants
and
to
advance
with
some
success
once
more
into
the
enemy
s
country
though
from
a
more
northern
position
whither
it
had
proceeded
by
sea
before
however
any
expedition
of
magnitude
or
that
promised
a
permanent
occupation
of
the
country
could
be
undertaken
from
merjee
now
the
position
of
the
bombay
force
it
was
necessary
that
it
should
be
reinforced
fact
reconstituted
and
the
opportune
arrival
of
the
large
body
of
european
troops
to
which
herbert
compton
and
his
companions
belonged
enabled
the
government
to
effect
this
in
an
efficient
manner
there
were
two
ways
also
in
which
the
dominions
of
mysore
could
be
assaulted
the
one
through
the
natural
road
or
gap
eastward
from
the
town
of
calicut
in
the
midst
of
which
was
situated
the
strong
fort
of
palghatcherry
and
which
led
immediately
into
the
rich
provinces
of
coimbatoor
and
barah
mahal
bordering
on
the
english
possessions
to
the
eastward
and
another
by
any
one
of
the
passes
which
led
upwards
from
the
level
country
between
the
ghats
and
the
sea
into
the
kingdom
of
mysore
the
southern
route
had
been
often
attempted
but
from
the
difficulty
of
the
road
the
dense
jungles
and
the
facility
with
which
the
invading
forces
could
be
met
by
the
mysore
armies
attacks
had
never
more
than
partially
succeeded
it
was
hoped
that
when
once
the
army
reached
the
above
the
mountains
it
would
not
only
hold
a
superior
and
commanding
position
for
further
operations
towards
the
capital
in
case
of
previous
success
but
it
would
possess
the
incalculable
advantage
of
a
cool
and
salubrious
climate
of
so
much
importance
to
the
the
european
troops
accordingly
when
it
was
known
at
bombay
that
the
force
had
been
enabled
to
escape
from
the
fort
of
paniané
where
as
we
have
mentioned
it
had
been
beleagured
by
tippoo
in
it
had
at
merjee
and
was
in
condition
to
resume
was
determined
that
the
whole
of
the
disposable
force
including
the
troops
should
be
sent
to
join
it
and
that
operations
should
be
commenced
without
delay
already
prepared
for
active
service
herbert
s
regiment
was
one
of
the
first
which
sailed
again
from
the
island
its
complete
equipment
and
the
health
and
spirit
of
the
officers
and
men
led
the
government
to
place
every
dependence
on
its
exertions
in
the
coming
arduous
contest
it
was
followed
on
the
same
day
by
others
and
three
or
four
days
of
delightful
sailing
down
the
beautiful
coast
brought
the
armament
to
its
desired
haven
and
the
troops
landed
amidst
the
cheers
and
hearty
welcome
of
their
future
brethren
in
arms
a
very
few
days
served
to
make
preparations
for
the
campaign
bullocks
and
stores
had
already
been
collected
with
a
few
elephants
to
assist
the
guns
in
their
ascent
of
the
passes
and
after
the
plans
for
the
campaign
had
been
determined
by
the
macleod
humberstone
and
army
moved
from
its
camp
toward
its
destination
there
was
necessarily
much
of
romance
in
the
early
campaigns
in
india
the
country
was
unknown
and
imagination
peopled
it
with
warlike
races
far
different
from
the
peaceable
inhabitants
of
the
in
whom
the
pride
of
possession
of
high
rank
of
wealth
of
fierce
bigotry
and
hatred
of
the
christians
uniting
made
them
no
less
the
objects
of
curiosity
than
worthy
enemies
of
the
gallant
bands
which
sought
them
in
war
those
who
were
new
to
the
country
and
who
in
the
close
atmosphere
and
thick
jungles
of
the
coast
saw
little
to
realise
their
dreams
of
eastern
beauty
looked
to
the
wall
of
mountains
spread
out
before
them
with
the
utmost
ardour
of
impatience
to
surmount
them
beyond
them
they
should
see
the
splendour
of
asiatic
pomp
the
palaces
the
gardens
the
luxuries
of
which
they
had
heard
beyond
them
they
should
meet
the
foes
they
sought
in
the
fair
field
there
there
was
not
only
honour
to
be
won
but
unbounded
the
sack
of
towns
the
spoil
of
treasuries
which
if
they
might
believe
the
reports
diligently
circulated
throughout
the
army
only
waited
their
coming
to
fall
into
their
possession
above
all
they
burned
to
revenge
the
defeat
and
destruction
of
bailie
s
detachment
in
the
west
which
was
vaunted
of
by
their
enemies
and
to
retrieve
the
dishonour
with
which
that
defeat
had
tarnished
the
hitherto
unsullied
reputation
of
the
british
the
spies
brought
them
word
that
the
passes
were
that
the
rich
city
of
bednore
with
its
surrounding
territory
was
unprotected
that
its
governor
an
officer
of
tippoo
s
and
a
hindoo
sought
earnestly
an
opportunity
to
revenge
his
own
dishonour
in
surrendering
this
the
key
of
his
master
s
dominions
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
urged
on
by
cupidity
and
inflamed
by
an
ardent
zeal
to
carry
the
instructions
he
had
received
into
effect
the
commander
mathews
looked
to
the
realisation
of
his
hopes
with
a
certainty
which
shut
out
the
necessity
of
securing
himself
against
reverses
and
hurried
blindly
on
to
what
at
first
looked
so
brightly
but
which
soon
clouded
over
and
led
to
the
miserable
fate
of
many
it
was
a
subject
of
painful
anxiety
to
herbert
and
his
companions
so
long
as
the
destination
of
their
regiment
was
unknown
for
the
army
had
to
of
it
to
reduce
the
forts
and
hold
the
country
below
the
passes
a
service
which
none
of
them
liked
in
anticipation
and
the
other
to
press
on
through
the
open
country
to
bednore
the
present
object
of
their
most
ardent
hopes
the
strong
fort
of
honoor
however
which
lay
not
far
from
their
place
of
rendezvous
could
not
be
passed
and
to
try
the
temper
of
the
troops
and
to
strike
terror
into
the
country
it
was
assaulted
and
carried
by
storm
with
the
spirit
of
men
whom
no
common
danger
could
appal
and
who
in
this
their
first
enterprise
showed
that
they
had
only
to
be
led
with
determination
in
order
to
perform
prodigies
of
valour
nor
was
there
any
check
given
to
their
rapacity
the
place
was
plundered
and
thus
their
appetites
were
whetted
both
with
blood
and
spoil
for
their
ensuing
service
now
indeed
shone
out
the
true
spirit
of
many
an
one
whom
herbert
and
his
companions
had
even
respected
hitherto
and
they
saw
rapacity
and
lust
possessing
them
to
the
extinction
of
every
moral
feeling
while
unbridled
revelry
habitual
disregard
of
temperance
and
indulgence
in
excesses
hurried
many
to
the
grave
whom
even
the
bullet
and
the
sword
spared
they
were
thankful
to
be
thus
knit
in
those
bonds
of
friendship
which
the
conduct
of
their
associates
only
drew
the
closer
they
lived
in
the
same
tents
marched
together
fought
together
and
found
that
many
of
their
duties
were
lighter
and
their
marches
and
watches
the
shorter
for
the
companionship
they
had
made
for
themselves
the
commander
mathews
a
man
of
deep
religious
feeling
quite
amounting
to
superstition
had
early
remarked
the
appearance
of
philip
dalton
his
high
bearing
his
steady
conduct
the
grave
expression
of
his
face
impressed
him
with
a
sense
of
his
assimilation
to
himself
in
thought
and
the
excellent
appearance
of
his
men
and
his
attention
to
their
comforts
with
a
high
estimate
of
him
as
a
soldier
nor
did
herbert
escape
his
observation
nor
the
evident
friendship
which
existed
between
them
on
inquiry
he
found
that
both
bore
the
highest
character
though
their
habits
of
exclusiveness
and
hauteur
were
sneered
at
yet
perceiving
the
cause
they
rose
the
higher
in
his
opinion
on
that
account
for
some
time
he
weighed
between
the
two
but
gradually
leaning
to
the
side
of
dalton
he
at
last
determined
to
offer
to
him
the
post
of
and
secretary
which
he
accepted
and
this
though
productive
of
temporary
separations
between
the
friends
still
gave
them
ample
opportunities
of
association
a
few
days
after
the
storm
and
capture
of
honoor
in
which
herbert
s
regiment
had
borne
a
conspicuous
part
and
he
as
commander
of
the
light
company
had
been
noticed
by
the
general
in
orders
the
army
reached
the
foot
of
the
pass
above
which
the
fort
of
hussainghurry
reared
its
head
and
from
which
it
took
its
name
of
the
defences
of
the
pass
all
were
in
fact
ignorant
but
the
native
spies
had
represented
them
as
weak
and
easily
to
be
surmounted
and
they
were
implicitly
believed
a
few
straggling
parties
of
the
enemy
had
been
met
with
during
the
day
and
driven
up
the
pass
without
any
prisoners
having
been
made
from
whom
an
idea
of
the
opposition
to
be
encountered
could
be
gained
or
extorted
the
way
however
lay
before
them
the
army
was
in
the
highest
spirits
and
though
the
only
road
discernible
was
a
rugged
path
almost
perpendicular
up
the
side
of
the
immense
mountain
yet
to
them
there
was
nought
to
be
morrow
would
see
them
on
the
head
of
the
ascent
breathing
a
purer
air
with
the
broad
plains
of
india
before
them
to
march
whither
they
listed
it
was
night
ere
the
army
was
safely
encamped
at
the
foot
of
the
pass
the
regiments
had
taken
up
their
ground
in
the
order
they
were
to
ascend
and
herbert
s
company
was
in
the
van
upon
it
would
rest
if
not
the
fate
of
the
day
at
least
the
brunt
of
the
ascent
philip
dalton
sought
him
after
his
duties
were
over
the
final
orders
had
been
given
and
the
various
officers
had
been
warned
for
the
performance
of
their
several
parts
in
the
coming
struggle
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
hot
work
herbert
he
said
as
he
entered
his
little
tent
where
sat
his
friend
writing
very
earnestly
i
tried
all
i
could
to
get
the
regiment
another
place
or
at
least
to
have
the
force
march
right
in
front
but
it
could
not
be
done
somehow
or
other
the
general
had
more
than
ordinary
confidence
in
the
light
company
of
the
and
was
pleased
to
express
a
very
flattering
opinion
of
my
friend
make
no
apologies
dear
philip
all
is
as
it
should
i
wish
it
i
would
not
have
it
otherwise
for
the
world
my
gallant
fellows
are
ready
for
the
fray
and
you
know
they
are
not
easily
daunted
besides
what
is
there
to
be
afraid
of
the
people
we
have
seen
as
yet
have
fled
before
us
ever
since
the
affair
of
honoor
and
i
for
one
anticipate
nothing
but
a
pleasant
walk
up
the
mountain
or
a
scramble
rather
for
the
road
does
not
look
over
there
will
be
hot
work
nevertheless
herbert
we
have
the
best
information
as
to
the
defences
of
the
pass
they
are
insignificant
it
is
true
but
every
rock
is
a
defence
and
a
shelter
from
whence
the
steady
fire
of
these
fellows
may
be
fatal
and
we
hear
of
a
scarped
wall
or
something
of
the
kind
at
the
top
which
we
can
not
very
clearly
make
out
would
that
i
understood
the
language
of
the
country
and
could
make
inquiries
myself
it
appears
to
me
that
those
who
pretend
to
know
it
make
but
a
lamentable
hand
of
it
and
guess
at
half
they
ought
to
it
matters
not
is
the
road
we
are
to
get
to
the
top
if
we
can
i
presume
no
other
orders
will
be
then
trust
me
for
the
rest
i
have
a
little
memorandum
here
which
i
was
writing
and
which
if
you
will
wait
with
me
for
a
while
i
will
finish
it
is
only
in
case
anything
happens
you
know
he
added
gaily
there
are
a
few
things
i
would
wish
to
be
i
will
not
disturb
you
so
write
on
i
too
had
a
similar
errand
is
but
an
interchange
of
there
my
few
words
are
soon
finished
said
herbert
these
are
addressed
to
you
philip
but
they
are
to
be
opened
in
case
only
of
accident
here
are
a
few
letters
that
i
have
written
in
my
desk
which
with
all
my
sketches
you
must
send
home
for
me
or
take
with
you
if
you
go
for
the
rest
this
will
tell
you
fully
all
i
wish
to
have
it
is
safe
with
me
herbert
if
i
am
safe
myself
of
which
i
have
small
ah
so
you
said
at
honoor
yet
who
exposed
himself
more
or
fought
better
nay
hand
to
hand
with
some
of
the
natives
than
yourself
i
shall
use
your
own
word
destiny
and
argue
against
nevertheless
i
am
more
impressed
than
ever
with
the
certainty
that
i
stand
before
you
for
the
last
time
herbert
i
shall
not
seek
danger
however
indeed
my
post
near
the
general
precludes
my
doing
so
of
my
own
accord
but
in
case
of
accident
here
are
my
few
memorandums
put
them
in
your
desk
where
they
can
remain
and
so
now
having
deposited
our
mutual
last
commands
with
each
other
let
us
not
think
on
the
morrow
philip
but
as
one
in
which
we
may
win
honour
if
god
wills
it
we
may
meet
when
all
is
over
and
we
are
quietly
encamped
upon
the
top
and
fight
all
our
battles
over
again
i
am
glad
at
all
events
that
i
shall
have
charles
balfour
with
ah
how
is
that
why
the
picquets
are
ordered
to
join
the
advance
guard
which
is
my
company
he
commands
them
and
is
yonder
bivouacking
under
a
tree
i
believe
i
was
going
to
him
when
you
came
poor
boy
i
believe
he
is
alone
will
you
come
with
all
my
they
took
their
way
through
the
busy
camp
where
numerous
were
gleaming
and
groups
of
native
soldiery
gathered
round
them
warming
themselves
from
the
cold
night
air
and
dew
which
was
fast
falling
the
spot
on
which
the
army
rested
was
an
open
space
at
the
very
foot
of
the
pass
surrounded
by
dense
jungle
and
mountains
whose
bulk
appeared
magnified
by
the
dusk
although
the
stars
shone
brightly
the
fires
which
blazed
around
caused
everything
to
appear
dark
except
in
their
immediate
vicinity
where
the
light
fell
on
many
a
swarthy
group
among
whom
the
rude
hooka
went
its
busy
round
as
they
sat
and
discussed
the
chances
of
plunder
on
the
morrow
or
the
events
of
the
past
day
everywhere
arose
the
busy
hum
of
men
the
careless
laugh
the
shout
for
a
friend
or
comrade
many
a
profane
oath
and
jest
and
often
the
burden
of
a
song
to
which
a
rude
chorus
was
sung
by
others
the
large
of
the
regiment
with
its
doors
wide
open
displayed
by
the
glare
within
a
group
of
choice
spirits
who
over
the
bottle
they
could
not
forsake
fought
their
battles
over
again
coolly
discussed
the
chances
of
promotion
and
openly
boasted
of
the
plunder
they
had
acquired
and
their
thirst
for
more
herbert
and
his
friend
could
almost
guess
from
the
gesticulations
the
nature
of
the
conversation
and
could
see
that
the
men
who
held
those
orgies
were
drowning
in
wine
the
cares
and
thoughts
which
the
events
of
the
coming
day
might
otherwise
press
on
them
they
turned
away
to
where
the
watchful
sentinels
placed
double
native
and
european
paced
upon
their
narrow
walk
and
where
around
the
embers
of
fires
which
had
been
lighted
the
picquets
lay
wrapped
in
their
coats
taking
the
rest
which
should
fit
them
for
the
morrow
s
arduous
strife
who
comes
there
challenged
the
nearest
sentry
one
of
his
own
company
a
compton
do
you
know
where
balfour
is
yonder
sir
the
officer
of
the
native
regiment
is
with
him
they
are
sitting
under
the
tree
near
yon
thither
they
was
but
a
few
steps
off
ah
this
is
kind
of
you
herbert
and
philip
to
come
to
cheer
my
watch
not
that
it
is
lonely
for
wheeler
here
who
shares
it
with
me
has
a
store
of
coffee
and
other
matters
very
agreeable
to
discuss
but
it
was
kind
of
you
to
come
to
me
now
be
seated
camp
fashion
upon
the
ground
and
let
us
talk
over
the
affairs
of
we
are
likely
it
appears
to
have
some
how
do
you
know
have
you
any
late
news
asked
philip
mr
wheeler
can
tell
you
better
than
i
but
a
short
time
ago
the
sentry
yonder
challenged
in
the
direction
of
the
pass
and
no
answer
being
returned
i
took
a
corporal
s
guard
and
made
a
little
expedition
which
was
in
some
degree
successful
for
we
caught
two
fellows
who
looked
marvellously
like
spies
but
who
on
being
interrogated
by
my
friend
here
swore
lustily
they
were
deserters
who
had
come
to
give
information
from
them
we
learned
that
at
least
twenty
thousand
of
tippoo
s
valiant
troops
were
prepared
to
make
this
a
second
thermopylæ
that
we
should
have
to
storm
entrenchments
and
perform
prodigies
of
valour
and
that
we
might
possibly
get
near
the
top
but
as
to
surmounting
it
that
was
out
of
the
question
was
it
not
so
wheeler
it
was
as
you
have
said
these
fellows
were
very
likely
put
forward
to
give
this
news
in
order
that
we
might
be
deterred
from
our
attack
and
thereby
give
them
time
to
throw
up
some
breastworks
or
stockades
at
which
they
are
expert
enough
i
fancy
however
the
intelligence
will
have
but
little
effect
upon
the
what
have
you
done
with
the
prisoners
sent
them
to
headquarters
of
course
philip
i
thought
you
must
have
seen
them
ere
no
indeed
i
have
not
but
it
is
time
i
should
i
may
be
wanted
too
and
i
must
bid
you
farewell
if
i
can
i
will
be
with
you
early
if
not
and
we
are
spared
we
shall
meet
on
the
summit
so
once
more
god
bless
you
both
god
bless
you
god
bless
you
both
repeated
sincerely
and
affectionately
as
they
wrung
his
hand
it
might
be
they
should
never
meet
again
but
they
were
young
and
soldiers
among
whom
such
thoughts
are
seldom
expressed
though
they
are
often
felt
herbert
as
yet
had
formed
no
acquaintance
with
the
officers
of
the
native
army
taught
by
the
tone
prevalent
among
those
of
his
own
at
that
period
to
consider
them
of
a
lower
grade
he
was
both
surprised
and
gratified
to
find
wheeler
a
man
of
very
general
information
in
particular
he
found
him
to
be
excellent
authority
on
many
matters
connected
with
the
usages
and
customs
of
the
native
troops
which
to
herbert
s
military
eye
had
appeared
quite
out
of
rule
and
the
sensible
explanations
he
gave
of
these
and
many
other
circumstances
not
only
amused
herbert
and
his
companion
during
their
watch
but
threw
much
light
on
the
objects
and
chances
of
success
in
their
undertaking
then
you
think
the
general
has
considered
the
end
without
the
means
to
accomplish
what
he
has
in
view
said
herbert
questioning
him
upon
a
remark
he
hazarded
i
do
i
think
too
and
the
thought
is
not
original
but
one
of
high
authority
that
i
could
mention
only
it
is
discreet
not
to
do
so
that
the
government
is
wrong
in
the
precipitancy
with
which
they
have
urged
this
on
and
are
injuring
it
daily
our
force
is
not
sufficient
to
keep
any
country
against
tippoo
s
whole
army
which
whatever
others
may
say
of
it
is
in
a
very
respectable
state
of
discipline
and
if
we
succeed
in
reaching
bednore
we
shall
hardly
get
out
of
it
with
whole
bones
have
we
men
to
occupy
the
passes
to
take
forts
to
secure
the
country
and
to
fight
tippoo
besides
we
have
little
force
enough
certainly
said
herbert
but
then
most
are
ay
but
they
are
difficult
to
support
and
helpless
if
not
supported
it
is
the
fashion
for
you
gentlemen
of
the
royal
army
to
cry
down
our
poor
fellows
who
after
all
fight
well
and
do
all
the
drudgery
we
may
never
meet
again
captain
herbert
but
you
will
remember
the
words
of
a
poor
sub
of
native
infantry
who
because
he
knows
more
of
the
native
character
than
your
general
and
more
of
the
country
is
very
much
disposed
to
prophesy
a
disastrous
end
to
what
is
just
now
very
i
hope
you
are
wrong
nevertheless
what
is
chalked
out
for
us
we
must
do
we
ought
to
have
no
opinions
but
those
of
our
ah
well
that
is
the
acmé
of
discipline
to
which
i
fear
we
shall
never
attain
said
the
lieutenant
laughing
i
for
one
am
willing
to
play
my
part
in
what
is
before
us
for
i
am
too
inured
by
this
time
to
hard
blows
and
desultory
fighting
to
care
much
for
the
passage
of
a
ghat
where
after
all
the
resistance
to
be
apprehended
may
only
be
from
a
few
fellows
behind
a
wall
with
rusty
you
are
right
wheeler
said
young
balfour
i
want
to
see
my
good
fellows
show
the
army
the
way
to
get
up
a
hill
you
herbert
will
answer
for
their
doing
the
thing
in
i
can
charles
but
remember
you
are
not
to
be
rash
as
your
superior
officer
i
shall
beg
of
you
to
use
discretion
with
your
valour
do
i
not
advise
well
wheeler
you
do
indeed
sir
i
wish
many
higher
than
you
in
rank
could
think
as
calmly
while
they
act
as
bravely
but
here
comes
the
of
the
night
we
must
be
on
the
alert
balfour
good
night
captain
compton
we
may
renew
this
i
shall
be
delighted
to
do
so
whenever
you
please
you
know
where
to
find
me
in
the
lines
of
the
i
am
seldom
absent
and
now
dear
charles
tell
me
before
you
go
if
i
can
do
anything
for
you
in
case
of
accident
dalton
and
i
have
exchanged
little
memorandums
which
i
felt
to
be
necessary
as
we
are
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
ah
there
is
really
no
danger
herbert
you
see
wheeler
says
there
is
none
do
not
say
so
charles
wherever
bullets
are
flying
there
is
danger
i
do
not
forbid
i
should
think
of
any
danger
to
it
is
our
duty
to
consider
such
matters
that
we
may
be
able
to
meet
them
you
are
right
you
are
right
dear
herbert
i
am
glad
you
have
spoken
to
me
for
i
dared
not
have
mentioned
it
to
you
or
dalton
but
in
case
i
case
you
know
of
any
will
write
home
about
me
herbert
you
will
find
the
direction
pasted
inside
my
poor
boy
the
sudden
thought
of
her
linked
with
that
of
his
own
possible
death
was
too
much
for
a
heart
overflowing
with
affection
for
his
only
parent
he
struggled
for
a
while
with
his
feelings
and
then
able
to
control
them
no
longer
burst
into
tears
herbert
did
not
check
them
it
was
but
for
a
moment
however
he
quickly
rallied
this
is
a
weakness
which
i
little
thought
to
have
displayed
herbert
but
just
then
my
thoughts
were
too
much
for
me
will
you
do
what
i
asked
that
will
i
most
cheerfully
if
i
live
and
just
tell
them
he
continued
gaily
what
sort
of
a
fellow
i
have
been
it
will
be
a
comfort
for
them
to
know
perhaps
enough
know
all
wheeler
has
got
his
men
ready
and
yonder
are
the
rounds
so
good
night
we
spend
for
a
time
at
all
events
in
company
i
am
glad
you
spoke
to
feel
all
the
lighter
for
it
good
night
charles
get
some
rest
if
you
can
after
the
rounds
are
past
you
will
need
it
and
all
appears
safe
and
quiet
now
around
herbert
slowly
returned
towards
his
tent
picking
his
way
amidst
the
prostrate
forms
of
the
native
followers
which
everywhere
covered
the
ground
wrapped
in
deep
sleep
all
was
now
still
except
the
spot
he
had
left
where
the
usual
words
of
the
guards
challenging
the
rounds
arose
shrill
and
clear
upon
the
night
air
and
the
pass
grand
is
well
gave
a
sense
of
security
which
in
the
midst
of
a
watchful
enemy
s
country
was
doubly
acceptable
once
he
thought
as
he
listened
that
the
challenge
was
answered
from
the
pass
by
the
shrill
and
quivering
blast
of
the
brass
horn
of
the
country
and
he
looked
lest
there
should
be
any
stir
discernible
but
all
was
still
the
giant
form
of
the
mountain
apparently
slept
in
the
calm
night
air
a
few
mists
were
wreathing
themselves
about
its
summit
which
was
sharply
defined
against
the
deep
blue
sky
glistening
with
stars
and
here
and
there
the
bright
twinkle
of
a
distant
far
above
him
showed
that
the
enemy
kept
their
watch
too
as
carefully
as
their
assailants
the
camp
was
quite
hushed
here
and
there
the
sharp
bark
of
a
dog
arose
but
was
as
instantly
silenced
or
the
screams
and
howlings
of
a
pack
of
jackals
as
they
prowled
about
the
outskirts
of
the
camp
in
search
of
offal
awoke
the
echoes
of
the
mountains
the
drowsy
tinklings
of
the
with
their
varied
tones
and
the
shrill
chirrupings
of
innumerable
grasshoppers
were
sounds
which
never
ceased
but
they
were
peaceful
and
invited
that
repose
which
all
needed
and
were
enjoying
chapter
xviii
long
ere
the
morning
s
dawn
had
broken
the
bugle
s
cheerful
note
had
sounded
the
reveillé
from
the
headquarter
tents
the
first
blast
arose
and
its
prolonged
echoes
rang
through
the
retiring
far
away
among
the
dense
returning
and
swelling
upon
the
ear
more
near
and
more
distinct
than
it
had
been
at
first
one
by
one
the
regiments
took
it
up
and
were
followed
by
their
drums
and
fifes
making
the
solitudes
which
hitherto
had
known
only
the
growl
of
the
bear
the
shrieking
howl
of
the
hyæna
or
the
bellow
of
the
wild
bison
resound
with
the
inspiring
and
martial
sounds
soon
all
were
prepared
the
regiments
fell
into
the
various
places
allotted
to
them
the
light
artillery
to
which
were
harnessed
the
strongest
and
most
active
piece
having
an
elephant
behind
to
urge
it
over
the
roughest
or
most
inaccessible
up
the
rear
each
man
was
as
lightly
equipped
as
possible
that
he
might
not
be
distressed
by
climbing
and
as
a
last
order
might
be
heard
the
words
fix
bayonets
with
cartridge
prime
and
load
pass
from
regiment
to
regiment
succeeded
by
the
rattling
of
the
muskets
and
jingling
sound
of
ramrods
as
each
sent
home
the
ball
which
he
firmly
hoped
might
in
its
discharge
bear
with
it
the
life
of
one
of
his
enemies
herbert
and
his
young
friend
balfour
had
long
been
ready
and
waiting
for
the
signal
to
advance
at
the
head
of
the
column
their
men
were
impatient
and
their
blood
was
chilled
with
the
long
detention
which
the
preparation
of
so
large
a
body
necessarily
occasioned
they
were
standing
around
a
fire
which
one
of
the
men
had
kindled
with
some
dry
leaves
and
sticks
gathered
from
the
adjacent
thickets
all
about
them
was
obscure
for
the
thick
vapour
which
had
wreathed
itself
about
the
early
in
the
night
had
now
descended
and
occupied
the
whole
of
the
narrow
valleys
in
dense
volumes
so
that
nothing
could
be
seen
beyond
their
immediate
vicinity
they
could
only
hear
the
as
they
arose
one
by
one
and
the
measured
tramp
of
many
feet
as
the
corps
moved
to
take
up
their
various
positions
this
is
very
tiresome
herbert
said
balfour
i
wish
we
were
off
i
think
we
could
do
much
under
cover
of
this
darkness
we
might
surprise
the
fellows
above
and
be
at
the
top
before
they
knew
what
we
were
i
rather
think
we
shall
wait
for
daylight
but
what
is
your
opinion
wheeler
he
said
to
the
young
man
who
had
just
joined
them
i
think
with
you
the
general
most
likely
has
heard
that
this
fog
will
rise
with
the
daylight
and
screen
us
half
way
up
perhaps
better
than
the
night
but
here
is
captain
dalton
who
looks
as
if
he
had
orders
for
the
advanced
where
is
your
captain
they
heard
him
ask
of
one
of
the
sergeants
i
have
orders
for
yonder
sir
replied
the
man
whose
concluding
words
were
unheeded
in
the
cry
of
here
here
by
the
fire
which
arose
from
the
trio
around
it
well
philip
are
we
to
move
on
i
suppose
there
will
be
no
signal
asked
herbert
as
dalton
rode
up
not
yet
not
yet
we
are
to
wait
till
daylight
returned
the
other
the
fellows
who
came
in
last
night
have
offered
to
lead
up
two
detachments
so
that
the
whole
force
can
advance
and
the
columns
support
each
that
is
well
so
far
but
we
are
still
to
have
the
main
path
i
oh
yes
and
the
native
company
will
lead
the
perhaps
yes
mine
and
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
now
captain
compton
we
have
a
fair
chance
natives
against
englishmen
in
fair
ah
here
are
the
fellows
will
you
take
charge
of
one
herbert
and
you
wheeler
of
the
other
if
either
of
you
find
they
have
led
you
wrong
you
are
at
liberty
to
shoot
them
upon
the
spot
will
you
explain
that
fully
to
them
if
you
please
indeed
they
ought
to
know
it
pretty
well
already
and
now
boys
and
good
success
to
ye
all
the
never
yet
yielded
and
you
have
the
post
of
honour
remember
these
few
words
were
received
with
a
hearty
shout
by
the
sections
around
and
dalton
departed
to
deliver
the
other
commands
with
which
he
was
charged
the
short
time
which
elapsed
before
the
signal
for
advance
was
passed
by
herbert
and
his
companions
in
examination
of
the
men
who
were
to
lead
them
with
very
different
feelings
had
these
men
sought
the
english
camp
the
one
a
nair
a
hindoo
of
high
birth
forcibly
converted
to
the
religion
of
mahomedanism
burned
for
an
opportunity
of
revenge
the
other
a
fellow
in
whose
heart
grew
and
flourished
every
base
passion
more
particularly
that
of
gain
which
had
led
him
to
proffer
his
services
to
the
english
commander
for
gold
they
had
both
been
promised
reward
which
while
the
one
indignantly
scorned
the
other
bargained
for
with
the
rapacity
of
his
nature
the
one
was
willing
to
hazard
his
life
for
his
revenge
the
other
for
the
gold
which
had
been
promised
how
different
was
to
be
the
fate
of
the
two
now
in
the
presence
of
the
two
young
english
leaders
both
were
confronted
and
examined
the
young
nair
a
fellow
of
high
and
haughty
bearing
ill
brooked
the
searching
and
suspicious
questions
of
the
english
officer
but
he
gave
nevertheless
clear
and
distinct
information
about
the
road
free
from
every
taint
of
suspicion
what
is
to
be
thy
reward
asked
wheeler
at
last
my
revenge
for
the
insult
upon
my
faith
i
was
a
nair
once
yet
am
now
a
vile
mussulman
i
need
say
no
more
and
it
concerns
thee
thou
art
haughty
enough
methinks
returned
his
questioner
as
thyself
was
his
only
reply
by
jove
he
is
a
fine
fellow
said
herbert
who
guessed
at
the
conversation
let
me
have
him
with
as
you
will
now
let
us
see
what
account
the
other
can
give
of
himself
what
is
to
be
thy
reward
good
fellow
i
was
promised
two
hundred
rupees
for
this
service
my
lord
will
surely
see
his
slave
gets
the
money
that
depends
upon
thy
conduct
if
thou
art
false
i
swear
to
thee
i
will
shoot
thee
like
a
dog
i
like
not
thy
your
slave
s
life
is
in
your
i
be
your
sacrifice
this
will
lead
you
safely
ask
him
yonder
whether
i
will
or
i
can
not
answer
for
him
said
the
nair
haughtily
he
guides
you
for
gain
give
me
the
post
of
danger
i
know
he
is
a
coward
at
heart
let
him
take
the
back
way
he
will
show
it
for
fear
of
his
life
i
will
fight
for
my
so
be
it
then
captain
compton
as
yours
is
the
main
column
take
you
the
best
man
i
leave
you
my
orderly
who
speaks
enough
english
to
interpret
a
little
between
you
and
your
guide
and
now
to
our
posts
for
the
day
dawns
i
how
did
you
not
feel
a
breath
of
wind
that
tells
us
that
the
new
day
has
awakened
you
will
soon
hear
the
nor
did
they
wait
long
the
sound
arose
from
the
centre
of
the
force
it
was
answered
by
the
others
in
front
and
rear
and
the
column
like
a
huge
snake
began
its
steep
and
tortuous
ascent
in
perfect
silence
herbert
had
received
orders
not
to
hurry
and
with
some
difficulty
restrained
the
ardour
of
his
men
and
the
impatience
of
his
young
friend
who
with
himself
was
with
the
leading
section
of
the
advance
long
they
climbed
up
the
narrow
and
rugged
pass
which
though
a
rough
one
possessed
the
form
of
a
road
and
as
yet
no
obstacle
had
been
met
with
the
mist
still
hung
upon
the
mountain
but
the
gentle
wind
which
had
arisen
was
swaying
it
to
and
fro
causing
it
to
wheel
in
eddies
about
them
and
the
now
increasing
light
showed
them
the
track
and
gave
them
glimpses
of
the
deep
and
precipitous
ravines
upon
the
very
edges
of
which
they
were
proceeding
depths
into
which
the
eye
strove
to
penetrate
but
filled
with
the
whirling
mists
which
though
in
motion
had
not
yet
arisen
for
nearly
an
hour
did
they
proceed
thus
slowly
in
order
that
the
rear
corps
might
fully
support
them
and
they
could
hear
the
steps
of
the
column
on
their
right
marching
parallel
with
themselves
at
no
great
distance
among
the
forest
trees
at
length
the
head
of
the
column
approached
a
rock
which
formed
an
acute
angle
with
the
road
motioning
with
his
hand
for
them
to
advance
slowly
the
young
nair
drew
his
sword
and
ran
lightly
on
they
saw
him
crouch
down
and
disappear
he
will
betray
us
cried
balfour
him
and
he
would
have
obeyed
the
impulse
of
his
ardour
but
for
his
captain
be
still
an
instant
i
will
answer
for
his
fidelity
exclaimed
herbert
he
had
hardly
spoken
ere
the
young
man
was
seen
again
waving
his
sword
now
my
lads
follow
me
cried
herbert
dashing
forward
promotion
to
the
first
who
enters
the
defences
ere
the
enemy
could
hear
the
cheer
which
followed
these
words
their
assailants
were
upon
them
turning
the
angle
they
beheld
a
wall
of
strong
masonry
with
for
musketry
one
side
of
which
was
built
against
a
precipitous
other
open
one
or
two
matchlocks
were
discharged
ineffectually
from
the
rampart
but
this
was
no
check
to
them
hurrying
on
they
crowded
through
the
side
opening
where
they
were
met
by
a
few
determined
fellows
who
opposed
them
for
an
instant
vain
endeavour
the
deadly
bayonet
was
doing
its
work
and
a
few
slight
only
served
to
inflame
those
who
received
them
to
more
deadly
revenge
the
nair
fought
nobly
cheered
on
by
the
soldiers
who
took
delight
in
his
prowess
he
threw
himself
headlong
upon
several
of
the
defenders
of
the
place
in
succession
and
though
he
too
was
slightly
wounded
yet
his
told
the
strength
of
arm
which
inflicted
them
and
the
deep
hate
and
revenge
which
urged
him
on
now
indeed
ensued
a
scene
of
excitement
and
spirited
exertion
difficult
to
describe
the
few
which
had
been
fired
proved
to
those
in
the
rear
that
the
work
had
begun
in
earnest
and
every
one
now
strove
to
be
the
first
to
mingle
in
it
the
column
pressed
on
disregarding
order
and
formation
which
indeed
was
little
necessary
but
which
was
preserved
by
the
officers
as
far
as
possible
the
gallant
macleod
was
soon
with
the
leading
sections
animating
the
men
by
his
gestures
and
his
cheers
they
needed
not
this
however
for
herbert
was
there
and
young
balfour
who
emulated
his
example
and
all
hurried
after
the
fugitives
from
ascent
to
ascent
with
various
effect
now
one
of
their
number
would
fall
by
a
one
of
the
europeans
as
the
retreating
enemy
turned
and
fired
now
a
wreath
of
smoke
would
burst
from
among
the
bushes
and
crags
above
them
and
the
bullets
would
sing
harmlessly
over
their
heads
or
rattle
among
the
stones
around
them
this
would
be
answered
by
the
steady
fire
of
a
section
which
was
given
ere
the
men
rushed
forward
with
the
more
sure
and
deadly
bayonet
herbert
and
his
men
guided
by
the
nair
still
fought
on
in
the
front
toiling
up
many
a
steep
ascent
one
by
one
the
works
which
guarded
them
were
carried
and
though
in
many
cases
obstinately
disputed
for
a
few
moments
yet
eventually
defenders
hurried
after
the
horde
of
fugitives
which
now
pressed
up
the
pass
before
them
at
length
a
steeper
acclivity
appeared
in
view
the
sides
of
which
were
lined
with
a
more
numerous
body
of
men
than
had
hitherto
been
seen
and
the
sun
which
now
broke
over
the
mountain
s
brow
for
the
first
time
glanced
from
their
steel
spears
and
bright
let
us
take
breath
for
a
moment
cried
macleod
and
do
all
of
ye
load
there
will
be
tough
work
last
if
i
mistake
not
of
this
affair
the
enemy
has
mustered
his
strength
and
awaits
our
coming
we
are
within
shot
yet
they
do
not
fire
you
have
behaved
nobly
captain
herbert
and
your
guide
is
a
gallant
fellow
balfour
too
seems
to
have
had
his
share
as
appears
by
his
sword
but
come
we
are
enough
together
now
and
the
rest
are
pressing
on
us
follow
me
gentlemen
for
the
honour
of
scotland
waving
his
sword
above
his
head
which
flashed
brightly
in
the
sunlight
he
dashed
on
followed
by
the
nair
and
the
others
upon
whom
the
momentary
rest
had
had
a
good
effect
their
aim
was
more
deadly
their
footsteps
firmer
and
more
rapid
urged
on
by
his
impetuosity
the
gallant
colonel
did
not
heed
the
motions
of
the
nair
who
fatigued
by
his
exertions
vainly
strove
to
keep
pace
with
the
commander
he
hurried
on
followed
by
nearly
the
whole
of
herbert
s
company
and
the
young
balfour
up
the
broad
ascent
which
invited
their
progress
but
which
it
was
apparent
from
the
position
of
the
defenders
would
be
hotly
contested
it
was
in
vain
that
the
nair
stormed
nay
raved
in
his
own
tongue
who
heeded
him
or
if
they
did
who
understood
him
there
is
no
road
there
is
no
road
there
he
cried
ah
fools
ye
will
be
lost
if
ye
persevere
follow
me
i
will
lead
know
the
way
fortunately
at
that
moment
herbert
happened
to
cast
his
eyes
behind
him
he
had
missed
the
young
nair
with
the
advance
and
had
thought
he
was
killed
he
now
saw
his
gesticulations
and
that
the
orderly
was
beside
him
a
sudden
thought
flashed
upon
him
that
there
was
no
road
from
the
confidence
with
which
the
attacking
party
was
about
to
be
received
and
hurrying
back
to
them
he
eagerly
demanded
the
cause
of
his
cries
no
road
there
no
road
he
know
the
road
he
show
the
road
was
the
answer
he
got
through
the
orderly
but
to
turn
any
portion
of
his
men
who
heard
nothing
and
saw
nothing
but
the
fierce
contest
which
had
begun
only
a
few
paces
above
them
was
a
matter
of
no
small
difficulty
a
steady
sergeant
or
two
of
a
different
regiment
and
some
of
his
own
men
at
last
saw
his
intentions
and
with
their
aid
he
found
himself
at
the
head
of
a
small
body
which
was
being
increased
every
instant
the
nair
surveyed
them
half
doubtfully
they
will
be
enough
he
said
in
his
own
tongue
and
dashed
down
a
narrow
path
which
led
from
the
main
road
following
this
in
breathless
haste
for
a
few
moments
and
in
fearful
anxiety
lest
he
should
be
betrayed
herbert
called
to
the
men
to
keep
together
and
as
they
began
again
to
ascend
he
saw
the
nature
of
the
nair
s
movement
the
wall
which
was
being
attacked
by
the
main
body
was
built
on
one
side
up
to
a
steep
precipice
the
edge
of
a
fearful
chasm
on
the
other
to
a
large
and
high
rock
of
great
extent
which
flanked
the
wall
and
defied
assault
from
the
front
but
could
evidently
be
turned
by
the
path
by
which
they
were
now
proceeding
how
his
heart
bounded
with
joy
therefore
when
after
a
few
moments
of
hard
climbing
he
found
himself
with
a
greater
number
of
men
than
he
had
expected
on
the
top
of
the
rock
within
the
enemy
s
position
pausing
for
an
instant
to
take
breath
he
saw
the
desperate
but
unavailing
struggle
which
was
going
on
below
him
in
the
vain
attempts
being
made
by
the
troops
to
scale
the
wall
what
could
they
do
against
a
high
wall
with
a
precipitous
rock
on
either
hand
and
a
murderous
fire
in
front
many
had
fallen
and
others
fell
as
he
looked
on
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
had
scarcely
fifty
men
with
him
the
redoubt
were
hundreds
give
them
one
steady
volley
boys
he
cried
to
his
men
wait
for
the
on
them
with
the
steel
secure
in
their
position
the
enemy
little
expected
this
discharge
by
which
some
dozen
of
their
number
fell
and
as
they
cast
a
hurried
glance
up
to
the
rock
it
was
plain
by
their
great
consternation
how
admirably
had
the
surprise
been
effected
numbers
in
an
instant
threw
away
their
arms
and
betook
themselves
to
flight
while
others
irresolute
hesitated
the
british
below
soon
saw
their
comrades
above
and
saluted
them
with
a
hearty
cheer
while
they
redoubled
their
efforts
to
get
over
the
wall
in
this
there
was
a
and
as
the
small
party
dashed
down
into
the
enclosure
amidst
the
confusion
and
conflict
which
ensued
one
of
them
contrived
to
open
it
eagerly
the
assailants
rushed
in
and
few
of
those
who
remained
asked
or
received
quarter
herbert
s
eye
was
fascinated
however
by
the
nair
his
guide
who
from
the
first
descent
from
the
rock
had
singled
out
one
of
the
defenders
of
the
redoubt
evidently
a
man
of
some
rank
he
saw
him
rush
upon
him
waving
his
reddened
sword
saw
the
other
defend
himself
gallantly
against
the
attack
the
soldiers
paused
to
see
the
issue
of
the
contest
the
nair
was
not
fresh
but
he
was
reckless
and
pressed
his
opponent
so
hard
that
he
retired
though
slowly
along
the
rampart
their
shields
showed
where
many
a
desperate
cut
was
caught
and
both
were
bleeding
from
slight
wounds
by
degrees
they
approached
the
platform
of
the
precipice
beyond
which
was
only
a
blue
depth
an
abyss
which
made
the
brain
giddy
to
look
on
ere
they
were
aware
of
it
the
combatants
urging
their
utmost
fury
and
apparently
not
heeding
their
situation
approached
the
edge
exchanging
cuts
with
redoubled
violence
and
now
one
now
the
other
reeled
under
the
blows
on
a
sudden
herbert
as
he
saw
it
he
sprang
forward
with
many
others
to
prevent
the
consequences
they
chief
who
had
his
back
to
the
edge
turn
round
and
look
at
his
position
the
next
instant
his
sword
and
shield
were
thrown
away
he
had
drawn
a
dagger
from
his
girdle
and
rushed
upon
the
nair
his
adversary
a
desperate
struggle
ensued
they
saw
the
fatal
use
made
of
the
knife
but
still
the
nair
dropping
his
sword
struggled
fiercely
on
as
they
approached
the
edge
the
suspense
became
fearful
for
no
one
dared
venture
near
the
combatants
in
another
instant
they
tottered
on
the
brink
still
struggling
a
portion
of
the
earth
gave
way
under
their
feet
and
they
fell
they
saw
for
an
instant
a
hand
grasp
a
twig
which
projected
disappeared
and
they
were
gone
for
ever
herbert
and
many
others
rushed
to
the
spot
and
shading
their
eyes
looked
over
the
precipice
they
saw
them
descending
bounding
from
every
jutting
pinnacle
of
rock
till
their
aching
sight
could
follow
them
no
longer
it
was
a
deadly
hate
which
must
have
prompted
that
man
s
exertions
this
day
said
a
voice
beside
him
as
herbert
turned
away
sickened
from
the
was
philip
dalton
may
that
being
into
whose
presence
he
has
gone
be
merciful
to
him
said
herbert
for
he
has
fought
well
and
bravely
and
guided
us
faithfully
without
his
aid
who
could
have
discovered
the
narrow
path
by
which
i
was
enabled
to
turn
this
position
you
herbert
i
thought
it
must
be
you
when
i
heard
how
it
had
been
done
i
envy
you
while
i
admire
your
courage
you
have
saved
the
army
we
should
have
lost
many
men
at
that
wall
but
for
your
then
you
saw
it
i
did
i
was
with
the
general
down
there
when
the
welcome
red
coats
appeared
on
the
rock
yonder
he
hailed
your
appearance
like
that
of
an
angel
deliverer
and
exclaimed
that
heaven
had
sent
not
heaven
philip
but
the
poor
fellow
who
lies
in
yonder
chasm
i
would
to
heaven
he
had
lived
do
not
think
of
him
herbert
but
as
one
who
has
fought
nobly
and
died
honourable
end
at
any
time
but
have
you
seen
charles
balfour
he
was
with
me
surely
said
herbert
but
no
now
that
i
remember
i
think
he
went
on
with
the
colonel
and
the
rest
good
god
he
must
have
been
in
all
that
hot
work
you
saw
nothing
of
him
as
you
passed
the
no
but
let
us
go
and
look
the
bugles
are
sounding
a
halt
and
you
have
done
enough
so
trouble
yourself
no
further
we
have
gained
the
ascent
and
the
enemy
is
flying
in
all
as
they
spoke
they
passed
through
the
into
the
open
space
beyond
where
many
a
poor
fellow
lay
writhing
in
his
vainly
crying
for
water
which
was
not
immediately
to
be
found
many
men
of
herbert
s
own
company
faces
familiar
to
him
from
long
companionship
lay
now
blue
and
cold
in
death
their
glazed
and
open
eyes
turned
upwards
to
the
bright
sun
which
to
them
shone
no
longer
his
favourite
sergeant
in
particular
attracted
his
notice
who
was
vainly
endeavouring
to
raise
himself
up
to
breathe
on
account
of
the
blood
which
nearly
choked
him
i
am
sorry
to
see
this
sadler
said
herbert
kindly
as
he
seated
him
upright
do
not
think
of
me
sir
said
the
poor
fellow
mr
balfour
is
badly
hurt
i
was
with
him
till
i
received
the
shot
but
they
have
taken
him
yonder
behind
the
then
i
must
leave
you
and
will
send
some
one
to
you
and
herbert
and
dalton
hurried
on
behind
the
rock
almost
on
the
brink
of
the
precipice
and
below
the
wall
there
was
a
shady
place
formed
by
the
rock
itself
and
by
the
spreading
branches
of
a
which
rustled
gently
over
it
this
served
for
a
kind
of
hospital
and
the
surgeons
of
the
force
as
one
by
one
they
came
up
lent
their
aid
to
dress
the
wounds
of
such
as
offered
themselves
there
supported
by
two
men
of
his
company
and
reclining
upon
the
ground
with
such
props
as
could
be
hastily
arranged
around
him
lay
charles
fair
and
handsome
features
disfigured
by
a
gaping
wound
in
his
cheek
and
wearing
the
ghastly
colour
and
pinched
expression
which
is
ever
attendant
upon
mortal
wounds
both
saw
at
once
that
there
was
no
hope
but
he
was
still
alive
and
as
he
heard
footsteps
approaching
his
dim
and
already
glazed
eye
turned
to
meet
the
sound
and
a
faint
smile
passed
over
his
countenance
evidently
of
recognition
of
his
companions
they
knelt
down
by
him
gently
and
each
took
the
hand
he
offered
i
thought
said
with
much
difficulty
and
very
faintly
i
thought
i
should
have
died
without
seeing
you
and
i
am
thankful
so
thankful
that
you
have
come
now
i
go
in
peace
a
few
moments
more
and
i
shall
see
you
and
this
bright
earth
and
sky
no
more
you
will
write
herbert
he
could
not
i
will
i
will
do
all
you
say
dear
charles
now
do
not
hurts
no
it
does
not
pain
me
but
i
am
dying
herbert
and
all
is
fast
becoming
dim
and
cold
it
is
pleasant
to
talk
to
you
while
life
lasts
you
will
tell
her
that
i
died
fighting
like
a
no
one
passed
me
in
the
struggle
not
even
herbert
could
not
answer
but
he
pressed
his
hand
warmly
thank
you
thank
you
now
pray
for
me
of
you
i
will
pray
too
reverently
they
removed
their
caps
from
their
brows
and
as
they
knelt
by
him
offered
up
in
fervency
prayers
unstudied
perhaps
and
even
incoherent
but
gushing
fresh
from
the
purest
springs
of
their
hearts
and
with
the
wide
and
glorious
scene
which
was
spread
out
before
them
for
their
temple
as
they
still
prayed
in
silence
each
felt
a
tremulous
shiver
of
the
hand
they
held
in
theirs
they
looked
upon
the
sufferer
a
slight
convulsion
passed
across
his
was
not
was
dead
both
were
brave
soldiers
both
had
borne
honourable
parts
in
that
day
s
fight
yet
now
as
their
eyes
met
overcome
by
their
emotions
both
wept
herbert
passionately
for
his
mind
had
been
worked
up
to
a
pitch
of
excitement
which
when
it
found
vent
at
all
was
not
to
be
repressed
but
after
awhile
he
arose
and
found
dalton
looking
out
over
the
magnificent
prospect
the
tears
were
glistening
in
his
eyes
it
was
true
but
there
was
an
expression
of
hope
upon
his
manly
features
which
showed
that
he
thought
charles
s
change
had
been
for
the
better
they
stood
almost
upon
the
verge
of
the
precipice
far
far
below
them
was
a
giddy
depth
the
sides
of
which
were
clothed
with
wood
and
were
blue
from
extreme
distance
mountains
of
every
strange
and
varied
form
whose
naked
tops
displayed
bright
hues
of
colour
rose
in
their
precipices
out
of
eternal
forests
and
formed
combinations
of
beautiful
forms
not
to
be
expressed
by
gracefully
sweeping
down
into
endless
successions
of
valleys
now
presenting
a
bold
and
rugged
outline
or
a
flat
top
with
perpendicular
sides
of
two
or
three
thousand
feet
which
descended
into
some
gloomy
depth
where
a
streamlet
might
be
seen
chafing
in
its
headlong
course
though
its
roar
was
not
even
heard
there
were
many
scathed
and
shattered
peaks
the
remains
of
former
convulsions
which
rearing
themselves
above
and
surrounded
by
mist
looked
like
a
craggy
island
in
a
sea
and
again
beyond
the
vapours
had
arisen
in
parts
and
floated
gracefully
along
upon
the
mountain
side
disclosing
glimpses
of
blue
and
indistinct
distance
to
which
the
mind
could
hardly
sea
of
mountains
of
all
forms
of
all
hues
blended
together
in
one
majestic
whole
and
glowing
under
the
fervent
light
of
the
brilliant
sun
and
they
looked
forth
over
this
with
heart
softened
from
the
pride
of
conquest
more
fitted
to
behold
it
to
drink
in
its
exquisite
beauty
from
the
scene
they
had
just
witnessed
than
if
in
the
exultation
of
victory
they
had
gazed
upon
it
from
the
rock
above
methinks
it
would
take
from
the
bitterness
of
death
said
herbert
to
part
from
life
amidst
such
scenery
which
of

an
involuntary
wish
to
rise
above
the
earth
to
behold
and
commune
with
the
author
and
creator
of
it

if
the
taste
of
this

we
are

so
exquisite

will
be
the
fulness
of
reality
poor
charles
his
fate
was
early
and
unlooked
for
yet
with
his
pure
spirit
in
the
hour
of
conquest
and
here
without
pain
too
we
may
well
think
there
was
bitterness
in
his
there
is
never
bitterness
in
death
if
we
look
at
it
steadily
herbert
and
consider
it
as
a
change
to
an
existence
far
more
glorious
charles
has
passed
away

our
little
company

this
strange
and
gorgeous
land

with
some
cheering
words
to
the
poor

were

who
fell
in

who
lie
near

water
after

and
though
he
could
originally
have
had
no
interest
in

has
yet
inherited
the
occupation
of
the
spot
from

swept
from

up
upon

beseeching
health
for

herbert
and
dalton
selected
the
spot
themselves
and
in
the
evening
after
they
had
completed
the
few
necessary
preparations
for
the
funeral
as
the
red
glow
of
the
declining
sun
was
lingering
upon
the
gilding
the
naked
precipices
till
they
shone
like
fire
and
the
huge
mountains
were
flinging
their
purple
shadows
over
the
deep
valleys
and
chasms
making
their
depths
even
more
profound
and
gloomy
slow
and
sad
funereal
train
which
bore
charles
balfour
to
his
grave
issued
from
the
camp
followed
by
most
of
the
officers
in
the
force
and
the
men
of
his
regiment
for
the
youngest
officer
in
it
had
been
a
favourite
with
all
and
his
daring
bravery
on
that
day
had
caused
a
double
regret
for
his
early
fate
what
more
affecting
sight
exists
than
a
soldier
s
funeral
the
cap
and
sword
and
belt
and
gloves
upon
the
coffin
speak
to
the
heart
more
than
studied
eulogy
or
the
pomp
of
nodding
plumes
and
silent
mutes
the
head
which
proudly
bore
the
one
the
arm
which
wielded
the
other
are
stiff
and
cold
earth
has
claimed
her
own
and
it
goes
to
its
last
narrow
not
in
the
triumphal
procession
of
hearses
and
lines
of
carriages
but
with
the
solemn
wail
of
the
music
for
the
dead
and
with
slow
and
measured
tramp
so
full
of
contrast
to
the
vigorous
and
decisive
step
of
military
movement
the
mournful
procession
passed
onward
till
it
reached
the
grave
the
funeral
party
which
preceded
the
coffin
performed
its
simple
movement
in
silence
and
as
the
lane
was
formed
and
the
men
bowed
their
heads
upon
the
butts
of
their
muskets
many
a
big
tear
could
be
seen
coursing
down
the
cheeks
of
those
who
had
fought
beside
him
who
had
passed
from
among
them
for
ever
soon
all
was
finished
the
rattle
of
musketry
resounded
in
the
still
evening
through
the
mountains
it
died
gradually
away
again
and
again
it
was
repeated
and
the
last
honours
being
paid
to
their
departed
brother
all
separated
and
returned
in
groups
to
the
camp
soon
to
forget
even
amidst
other
excitements
than
those
of
action
or
constant
service
the
solemnity
of
the
scene
they
had
been
engaged
in
philip
and
herbert
remained
however
till
the
grave
was
filled
in
and
stones
and
thorns
were
piled
upon
it
and
by
this
time
evening
had
far
advanced
and
spread
her
dusky
mantle
over
the
sublime
scenery
all
beyond
the
pass
gradually
became
a
dark
void
wherein
nothing
was
discernible
save
here
and
there
a
dim
twinkling
light
which
showed
where
a
shepherd
kept
his
watch
or
a
few
cooked
their
evening
meal
after
the
labours
of
the
day
they
could
not
remain
long
the
chill
breeze
which
arose
as
night
advanced
though
it
was
pleasant
to
their
relaxed
frames
warned
them
to
retire
to
the
shelter
of
their
tent
and
if
their
evening
there
was
spent
sadly
at
least
they
had
the
satisfaction
of
thinking
that
all
the
honours
of
a
soldier
s
death
had
been
shown
to
their
young
friend
and
that
he
lay
in
a
grave
which
would
be
unmolested
for
ever
it
is
far
from
our
intention
to
follow
the
operations
of
this
campaign
which
are
already
matters
of
history
except
as
they
are
necessary
to
the
explanation
of
the
positions
into
which
the
fate
of
herbert
compton
led
him
it
has
been
already
stated
that
the
rich
town
of
bednore
the
capital
of
the
province
in
which
the
army
now
was
had
been
from
the
first
the
object
of
the
present
campaign
accordingly
mathews
the
day
after
the
assault
of
the
pass
pressed
onwards
with
his
whole
force
to
hyderghur
a
strong
fort
on
the
way
to
bednore
this
place
quickly
yielded
and
the
governor
having
been
offered
terms
by
the
english
commander
agreed
to
them
and
delivered
over
the
whole
of
the
districts
dependent
upon
the
fortress
the
fortress
of
anantpoor
soon
followed
and
the
country
was
quickly
occupied
by
small
detachments
and
the
inhabitants
yielded
apparently
quiet
possession
to
their
conquerors
bednore
was
next
approached
and
as
the
minarets
and
houses
appeared
to
the
view
of
the
army
and
it
was
known
that
its
governor
had
deserted
his
post
all
were
clamorous
to
be
led
at
once
against
it
both
because
it
was
to
be
their
after
their
fatiguing
service
and
was
described
to
be
full
of
treasure
which
would
become
their
lawful
spoil
the
possession
of
it
was
the
more
urgent
because
only
six
rounds
of
ammunition
remained
to
each
man
in
the
whole
army
with
this
miserable
provision
no
operation
of
any
magnitude
could
be
undertaken
there
was
no
prospect
of
immediate
supplies
from
bombay
the
communication
from
the
coast
was
very
irregular
but
bednore
was
before
them
and
reckless
almost
of
consequences
it
was
attacked
and
carried
by
escalade
with
all
the
ardour
of
desperate
men
the
reduction
of
the
forts
of
the
country
followed
and
in
a
mistaken
idea
perhaps
all
were
occupied
with
small
detachments
thus
the
army
was
rendered
inefficient
and
in
a
great
measure
the
execution
of
these
services
gave
notoriously
such
profit
to
the
officers
engaged
in
them
on
account
of
the
plunder
they
obtained
that
they
were
with
difficulty
recalled
the
dreams
all
had
entertained
of
riches
appeared
to
be
realised
the
spirit
of
rapacity
pervaded
all
ranks
and
each
man
was
anxious
to
secure
what
he
could
of
the
golden
harvest
during
the
month
of
february
these
and
other
operations
below
the
passes
took
place
and
when
the
army
or
such
part
of
it
as
could
be
assembled
at
bednore
was
collected
it
was
the
general
expectation
that
the
immense
booty
would
be
divided
and
at
all
events
that
the
army
would
receive
its
pay
which
to
most
of
the
troops
was
considerably
in
arrear
herbert
however
had
been
prevented
by
a
wound
received
at
the
storm
of
anantpoor
from
taking
any
part
with
his
regiment
in
the
operations
we
have
alluded
to
he
had
received
a
severe
upon
his
right
arm
which
though
it
did
not
confine
him
to
his
bed
yet
rendered
it
impossible
for
him
to
accompany
the
regiment
and
after
the
possession
of
bednore
he
remained
there
with
the
other
sick
and
wounded
dalton
on
the
contrary
continued
to
be
most
actively
employed
and
in
all
the
affairs
of
the
campaign
bore
a
conspicuous
part
his
constant
association
with
the
general
gave
him
opportunities
of
observing
his
character
narrowly
while
he
admired
the
courage
and
the
perseverance
with
which
he
laboured
to
carry
out
to
the
letter
the
instructions
of
the
government
he
could
not
but
see
that
his
blind
reliance
upon
fate
his
neglect
of
the
most
ordinary
means
of
gaining
intelligence
and
of
providing
stores
and
supplies
for
his
army
he
denied
them
the
power
of
purchasing
for
themselves
by
withholding
their
pay
which
he
had
ample
means
to
discharge
sooner
or
later
be
the
causes
of
ruin
to
the
expedition
which
so
long
as
it
was
not
menaced
by
the
armies
of
mysore
held
efficient
possession
of
the
territory
it
had
gained
nor
was
it
to
be
doubted
that
tippoo
with
the
whole
resources
of
his
kingdom
at
his
perfect
command
would
make
a
decisive
attempt
for
the
recovery
of
this
his
favourite
and
most
fertile
province
dalton
had
repeatedly
urged
these
considerations
upon
his
commander
with
the
utmost
earnestness
but
without
effect
and
the
events
which
followed
their
return
to
bednore
were
of
a
character
to
excite
his
most
lively
apprehensions
no
sooner
had
the
chief
commanders
of
the
army
at
bednore
from
their
various
expeditions
than
a
division
of
the
plunder
or
at
any
rate
an
issue
of
pay
was
insisted
upon
by
them
and
by
some
of
the
officers
for
the
sum
which
had
been
collected
was
notoriously
very
large
the
whole
amount
of
the
revenue
of
the
district
had
been
seized
in
the
bednore
treasury
and
this
with
the
property
and
jewels
the
plunder
of
the
various
forts
might
have
been
considered
available
in
part
to
the
public
service
with
an
obstinacy
however
peculiar
to
his
character
mathews
refused
any
distribution
the
small
advances
doled
out
to
the
officers
and
the
men
were
dissipated
as
fast
as
given
and
were
totally
inadequate
to
their
wants
and
a
general
spirit
of
discontent
little
short
of
absolute
mutiny
arose
throughout
the
army
after
many
scenes
of
violent
recrimination
of
mutual
threats
of
forcible
suspension
from
the
functions
of
their
office
between
the
general
and
his
subordinates
the
latter
declared
to
him
in
the
presence
of
dalton
and
others
of
his
staff
that
they
felt
themselves
perfectly
justified
for
the
safety
of
the
army
and
the
furtherance
of
the
public
interests
to
proceed
at
once
to
bombay
and
in
person
to
expose
his
conduct
having
come
to
this
determination
mathews
made
no
attempt
to
shake
it
convinced
though
mistakenly
that
he
was
acting
for
the
public
good
he
formally
granted
them
the
permission
they
would
otherwise
have
taken
and
requested
captain
dalton
would
hold
himself
in
readiness
to
proceed
with
the
three
commanders
as
the
bearer
of
his
despatches
which
contained
his
reasons
for
acting
as
he
had
done
his
requests
for
further
aid
and
instructions
as
to
his
ultimate
proceedings
this
was
a
somewhat
sudden
blow
to
dalton
who
would
have
far
preferred
remaining
with
the
general
to
whom
he
felt
a
strong
attachment
which
was
increased
by
the
difficulties
and
dangers
by
which
he
saw
him
encompassed
and
for
a
while
he
endeavoured
to
make
a
change
in
his
determination
there
were
others
he
said
of
the
staff
much
more
fit
to
execute
the
orders
than
himself
men
who
were
acquainted
with
the
authorities
at
the
presidency
and
with
the
language
of
the
country
so
necessary
in
a
rapid
journey
to
and
from
the
coast
but
the
general
continued
inflexible
his
confidence
in
the
manly
and
independent
character
of
dalton
was
not
to
be
shaken
and
philip
himself
soon
saw
that
it
was
useless
to
press
him
upon
the
point
once
he
suggested
that
his
friend
herbert
should
fulfil
the
mission
and
the
mention
of
his
name
thus
casually
led
to
a
request
on
the
part
of
the
general
that
he
would
undertake
captain
dalton
s
duties
during
his
absence
this
was
satisfactory
to
both
of
them
to
philip
particularly
for
he
felt
assured
in
the
talent
and
excellent
military
knowledge
of
herbert
which
he
was
daily
increasing
by
study
that
the
general
would
have
advice
upon
which
he
could
depend
then
philip
you
will
be
back
within
a
month
said
herbert
as
they
sat
together
the
evening
before
his
departure
i
think
so
macleod
and
humberstone
are
very
friendly
to
me
though
we
go
upon
opposite
errands
for
which
i
would
to
god
no
necessity
existed
and
they
are
determined
to
get
back
as
soon
as
possible
indeed
you
know
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
things
can
not
go
on
much
longer
in
this
no
indeed
i
regret
sincerely
that
matters
are
thus
what
in
the
world
can
make
the
old
man
so
obstinate
i
know
not
it
is
in
vain
that
i
have
represented
the
absolute
necessity
for
a
distribution
of
money
or
for
a
in
order
that
the
army
may
know
something
of
what
was
secured
here
and
elsewhere
it
is
in
vain
the
old
man
is
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
this
wealth
it
occupies
his
thoughts
incessantly
and
though
it
is
not
his
yet
i
verily
believe
he
can
not
make
up
his
mind
to
part
with
it
merely
because
it
is
it
is
most
strange
one
of
those
curious
anomalies
in
human
conduct
which
we
often
see
without
being
able
to
give
any
satisfactory
reason
for
it
i
hope
however
the
government
will
decide
the
matter
and
soon
send
you
back
to
us
indeed
i
hope
so
too
i
very
much
suspect
the
general
will
be
superseded
for
in
truth
he
is
little
fitted
to
command
but
you
will
be
able
to
judge
of
this
yourself
in
a
day
or
well
i
shall
see
at
any
rate
he
shall
have
my
opinion
upon
the
state
of
the
fortifications
which
i
have
often
mentioned
to
and
i
to
him
but
he
relies
so
implicitly
upon
his
fate
and
is
so
sure
of
aid
which
seems
to
me
like
a
hope
in
a
miraculous
intervention
in
his
favour
that
i
ceased
to
urge
there
is
no
use
in
our
speaking
more
now
upon
this
vexatious
subject
philip
and
i
pray
you
to
execute
my
commissions
in
bombay
here
are
a
few
letters
for
england
and
some
drawings
among
them
one
for
charles
s
poor
mother
and
a
sketch
of
the
place
where
he
fell
and
his
last
which
please
despatch
for
me
perhaps
you
can
get
them
into
the
government
packets
if
so
they
will
be
safer
than
in
the
ship
s
here
too
is
a
packet
of
drawings
of
all
our
late
scenes
and
skirmishes
till
my
wound
prevented
my
sketching
any
more
which
you
may
have
an
opportunity
of
sending
by
a
private
hand
and
if
not
any
of
the
captains
will
take
it
for
me
i
have
no
i
will
arrange
all
for
you
safely
herbert
i
have
written
some
letters
myself
and
they
can
all
go
together
i
doubt
not
i
shall
be
able
to
get
one
of
the
secretaries
to
forward
them
and
your
drawings
besides
which
are
not
very
large

these
trifling

now
and
god

i
hope
will

be
further
distant

three
weeks
or
a
month
take
care
of
the
old
commander
and
if
you
can
persuade
him
into
parting
with
some
money
and
into
vigilance
and
exertion
you
will
not
only
be
cleverer
than
i
am
but
will
deserve
the
thanks
of
all
i
will
try
at
all
events
so
don
t
forget
my
letters
whatever
you
do
for
there
are
those
in
our
merry
england
who
look
for
them
with
almost
feverish
impatience
god
bless
you
they
wrung
each
other
s
hands
with
warm
affection
and
even
the
tears
started
to
herbert
s
eyes
he
thought
then
that
he
should
be
alone
to
meet
any
vicissitudes
which
might
arise
and
he
could
not
repress
a
kind
of
presentiment
of
evil
vague
and
indefinite
if
he
had
been
dalton
he
would
have
expressed
it
but
his
was
a
differently
constituted
temperament
and
he
was
silent
another
warm
and
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
and
philip
was
gone
the
rest
of
that
evening
and
night
was
sad
enough
to
herbert
and
many
anxious
thoughts
for
the
future
rose
up
in
his
mind
dalton
was
only
to
be
absent
a
month
but
in
that
time
what
might
not
happen
the
army
was
inefficient
from
being
broken
up
into
detachments
and
the
best
commanders
were
about
to
leave
the
authority
would
devolve
upon
others
who
were
untried
in
such
situations
disaffection
and
party
spirit
were
at
a
high
pitch
should
the
enemy
hear
of
this
and
attack
them
he
feared
they
could
but
ill
resist
however
he
thought
he
could
do
much
by
forcible
entreaty
with
the
general
whom
he
was
now
in
a
condition
to
advise
and
as
he
said
these
thoughts
are
but
the
effect
of
circumstances
after
all
for
how
often
is
it
that
they
who
are
departing
on
a
journey
in
the
prospect
of
novelty
and
occupation
of
thought
have
spirits
lighter
and
more
buoyant
than
those
who
remaining
can
not
only
imagine
dangers
for
the
absent
but
are
oppressed
with
anxieties
for
their
safe
progress
and
lest
evils
should
come
in
which
their
aid
and
sympathy
will
be
wanting
but
sad
thoughts
will
soon
pass
away
under
the
action
of
a
mind
and
herbert
in
his
ensuing
duties
found
much
to
occupy
his
and
prevent
it
from
dwelling
upon
ideal
evils
they
were
not
however
without
foundation
but
a
few
days
had
elapsed
after
the
departure
of
his
friend
ere
herbert
began
to
suggest
plans
to
the
commander
for
the
general
safety
young
as
he
was
he
put
them
forward
with
much
diffidence
and
only
when
they
were
supported
by
another
officer
of
the
staff
who
could
not
blind
his
eyes
to
the
critical
state
of
the
army
leaving
for
a
while
the
vexatious
subject
of
money
upon
which
the
general
could
not
be
approached
without
giving
way
to
passionate
expressions
they
gradually
endeavoured
to
lead
his
attention
to
the
state
of
the
fortifications
which
ruinous
and
neglected
as
they
were
could
not
afford
defence
against
any
ordinarily
resolute
enemy
they
next
endeavoured
to
organise
some
system
of
intelligence
for
of
what
was
passing
within
twenty
miles
of
even
the
state
of
their
own
had
no
knowledge
whatever
they
urged
upon
their
infatuated
commander
the
necessity
of
establishing
some
order
and
discipline
in
the
army
which
from
neglect
inactivity
and
poverty
was
becoming
riotous
and
unmanageable
but
all
was
in
vain
the
more
apparent
the
difficulties
of
his
situation
were
made
to
him
the
more
he
tried
to
shut
his
eyes
against
them
and
when
driven
by
absolute
conviction
to
confess
the
peril
which
daily
increased
though
as
yet
no
enemy
threatened
he
declared
that
he
had
reliance
in
almighty
power
to
send
succour
to
perplex
the
councils
of
his
enemies
to
distract
their
attention
from
one
who
having
carried
conquest
so
far
was
destined
though
certainly
in
some
strait
at
present
to
rise
out
of
all
his
troubles
triumphant
to
confound
his
enemies
and
those
who
sought
to
dispossess
him
of
his
situation
it
was
in
very
despair
therefore
that
herbert
and
the
others
who
had
aided
him
in
his
plans
were
at
length
obliged
to
desist
from
further
importunity
and
to
settle
down
into
a
kind
of
dogged
resolution
to
bear
with
resignation
whatever
might
be
hidden
behind
the
dark
veil
of
the
future
and
all
hoped
that
news
would
speedily
arrive
of
the
supercession
of
the
general
and
the
appointment
of
some
other
more
competent
person
it
will
be
remembered
that
two
persons
came
into
the
english
camp
on
the
night
before
the
storming
of
the
pass
the
fate
of
one
will
be
fresh
in
the
reader
s
memory
the
other
performed
his
part
well
he
led
the
column
he
guided
steadily
on
one
side
of
all
the
entrenchments
by
narrow
bypaths
and
difficult
places
it
reached
the
top
in
time
to
intercept
the
fugitives
who
driven
from
redoubt
to
redoubt
and
finally
from
the
last
as
we
have
already
mentioned
fled
and
were
destroyed
in
great
numbers
by
the
second
column
which
intercepted
many
of
them
at
the
summit
of
the
pass
this
guide
whose
name
was
jaffar
sahib
therefore
received
his
full
reward
and
more
and
as
he
was
assumed
to
be
faithful
so
the
general
kept
him
about
his
person
and
lent
a
ready
ear
to
his
suggestions
by
him
he
had
been
informed
of
some
secret
stores
of
treasure
which
he
had
added
to
the
general
stock
by
him
he
was
told
of
the
terror
with
which
his
presence
and
conquest
had
inspired
tippoo
and
his
armies
who
would
not
dare
to
attack
him
and
if
the
unfortunate
general
ever
ventured
to
express
a
doubt
of
the
security
of
his
position
he
was
flattered
into
the
belief
that
there
was
no
fear
and
was
told
in
the
language
of
oriental
hyperbole
that
it
was
impregnable
the
interpreter
between
them
was
the
general
s
personal
servant
proof
against
a
heavy
bribe
and
greater
lent
himself
to
the
deep
designs
of
the
other
it
was
long
before
suspicion
of
this
person
entered
the
mind
of
herbert
but
a
remark
that
fell
from
the
general
one
day
that
he
had
the
best
information
of
the
proceedings
of
the
enemy
when
it
was
very
evident
he
had
none
at
all
led
him
to
suspect
that
jaffar
sahib
was
exercising
with
the
general
a
fatal
and
as
yet
unknown
influence
the
man
s
conduct
however
was
so
guarded
his
civility
and
his
apparent
readiness
to
oblige
so
great
that
it
was
long
before
herbert
s
suspicion
led
him
to
adopt
any
course
to
detect
him
but
expressions
however
light
will
sometimes
remain
upon
the
memory
and
oftentimes
obtrude
themselves
upon
our
notice
when
least
expected
during
a
nightly
reverie
when
the
scenes
of
the
short
campaign
were
vividly
present
to
his
imagination
he
remembered
the
tone
of
contempt
in
which
the
gallant
nair
had
spoken
of
jaffar
sahib
and
though
he
had
not
understood
the
words
yet
he
could
not
help
thinking
there
was
more
implied
in
them
than
wheeler
had
noticed
early
the
next
day
he
sought
that
officer
with
whom
he
had
been
in
constant
association
and
mentioned
his
doubts
to
him
wheeler
readily
repeated
the
words
which
the
nair
had
used
and
remembering
his
tone
of
contempt
he
was
gradually
led
to
think
with
herbert
that
there
was
ground
for
extreme
suspicion
and
watchfulness
nothing
however
could
be
discovered
against
the
man
and
though
they
set
others
to
watch
his
movements
they
could
not
ascertain
that
he
held
communication
with
any
one
but
the
general
s
own
servants
among
whom
he
lived
the
first
three
days
of
april
had
passed
and
as
yet
there
was
no
news
of
the
issue
of
the
appeal
to
bombay
all
were
anxious
upon
the
subject
and
ran
higher
and
higher
in
consequence
they
had
soon
however
matter
for
sterner
contemplation
on
the
fourth
morning
early
there
arose
a
slight
rumour
that
tippoo
s
army
was
approaching
three
similar
ones
had
been
heard
before
but
nothing
had
followed
and
herbert
flew
with
the
intelligence
to
the
general
accompanied
by
wheeler
for
their
suspicions
were
roused
to
the
utmost
against
jaffar
sahib
impossible
said
the
general
when
he
had
heard
the
news
i
have
the
most
positive
information
that
tippoo
is
at
seringapatam
and
purposes
advancing
in
the
opposite
direction
to
meet
the
madras
army
who
is
the
author
of
this
groundless
rumour
gentlemen
it
was
prevalent
they
said
in
the
some
scheme
of
the
to
raise
the
price
of
grain
i
have
no
doubt
but
here
is
jaffar
sahib
the
faithful
fellow
to
whom
we
owe
much
of
our
success
and
who
would
be
the
first
to
give
this
information
if
it
were
true
ask
him
if
you
please
wheeler
what
he
wheeler
put
the
question
and
the
man
laughed
confidently
it
is
a
lie
is
a
lie
look
you
sir
as
you
speak
my
language
so
well
perhaps
you
can
read
it
also
here
are
letters
which
i
have
daily
received
from
seringapatam
through
a
friend
who
thus
risks
his
life
in
the
service
of
the
brave
english
they
contain
the
daily
records
of
the
bazaar
there
and
the
movements
of
the
we
will
have
them
read
by
a
scribe
if
you
please
general
said
wheeler
if
thou
art
faithless
as
i
suspect
he
continued
to
the
man
thou
shalt
hang
on
the
highest
tree
in
the
fort
my
life
is
in
your
hands
he
replied
in
his
usual
subdued
tone
i
am
not
afraid
that
you
should
the
letters
were
read
and
were
as
he
described
them
to
be
daily
accounts
from
the
capital
where
the
army
was
said
to
be
quiet
the
last
letter
was
only
four
days
old
the
time
which
the
post
usually
occupied
now
gentlemen
are
you
satisfied
cried
the
general
in
triumph
have
i
not
always
told
you
that
i
possessed
the
most
exact
information
through
this
my
faithful
servant
contradict
i
pray
you
this
absurd
rumour
and
believe
me
that
there
is
no
but
the
next
morning
as
the
day
broke
a
cloud
of
irregular
cavalry
was
seen
by
those
on
the
advancing
from
the
southward
and
amidst
the
confusion
and
alarm
which
followed
no
efforts
were
made
to
check
to
defend
the
outer
lines
of
fortification
which
would
have
enabled
the
english
to
have
strengthened
their
position
within
a
few
skirmishes
occurred
in
ineffectual
attempts
to
retain
their
ground
and
before
noon
the
place
was
formally
invested
by
the
regular
infantry
and
very
efficient
artillery
of
tippoo
s
army
herbert
and
wheeler
made
every
search
for
jaffar
sahib
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
confusion
he
and
the
general
s
servant
who
had
been
his
confidant
and
associate
had
escaped
then
only
broke
upon
the
unfortunate
general
a
bitter
prospect
and
a
sense
of
the
misery
he
had
brought
upon
himself
and
others
but
instead
of
yielding
to
any
despair
the
courage
and
discipline
of
the
army
rose
with
the
danger
which
threatened
its
very
existence
animosities
were
forgotten
and
while
the
siege
of
the
fort
was
vigorously
pressed
by
tippoo
and
with
the
most
efficient
means
its
defenders
exerted
themselves
with
the
intrepidity
and
spirit
of
english
soldiers
to
repel
their
assailants
with
their
insufficient
means
of
defence
broken
and
ruined
gradual
failure
of
ammunition
and
of
exertions
at
length
relaxed
and
after
a
vigorous
assault
directed
by
tippoo
in
person
they
were
forced
to
relinquish
the
outer
walls
and
retire
within
the
citadel
where
they
were
now
closer
and
closer
pressed
and
without
any
chance
of
escape
or
relief
in
this
condition
and
having
done
all
that
brave
men
could
for
the
defence
of
their
honour
and
of
their
post
the
general
was
induced
to
offer
a
capitulation
the
deputation
was
received
with
courtesy
by
tippoo
the
officers
complimented
on
their
valorous
defence
of
an
almost
untenable
post
and
the
articles
of
capitulation
having
been
drawn
up
they
returned
to
their
companions
the
conditions
were
accepted
with
some
modifications
after
a
day
or
two
s
negotiation
and
the
of
april
was
fixed
as
that
on
which
they
should
march
out
with
the
honours
of
war
and
after
that
they
should
move
with
their
private
property
to
the
coast
it
was
destined
however
to
be
otherwise
by
the
articles
of
capitulation
it
was
specified
that
all
treasure
in
possession
of
the
garrison
was
to
be
given
though
the
private
property
of
the
officers
and
men
was
to
be
respected
yet
all
public
stores
and
treasure
were
to
be
surrendered
in
good
faith
but
the
officers
and
men
whose
means
of
that
the
army
was
to
be
broken
up
and
disorganised
upon
becoming
prisoners
of
entirely
depend
upon
the
charity
of
their
conquerors
were
little
inclined
to
trust
to
so
questionable
a
source
and
the
evening
before
the
capitulation
was
to
be
carried
into
effect
a
large
body
of
the
garrison
in
a
state
of
mutiny
surrounded
the
abode
of
the
general
and
with
tumultuous
cries
demanded
pay
herbert
was
with
the
old
man
assisting
him
to
pack
up
such
articles
as
could
most
easily
be
carried
away
when
the
demand
was
made
it
was
in
vain
that
by
the
general
s
order
he
attempted
to
reason
with
the
men
to
show
them
the
dishonour
of
touching
anything
of
what
had
been
promised
in
exchange
for
their
lives
they
would
listen
to
no
reason
we
are
starving
they
cried
and
there
is
treasure
yonder
we
will
have
it
but
at
last
they
were
satisfied
on
receiving
the
assurance
of
a
month
s
pay
to
each
man
and
reluctantly
the
general
surrendered
the
keys
of
the
treasury
the
regiments
were
engaged
in
receiving
the
money
when
some
one
bolder
than
the
rest
exclaimed
why
not
have
it
all
boys
we
may
as
well
have
it
as
let
it
go
to
the
the
cry
acted
at
once
upon
their
excited
spirits
let
us
have
it
all
was
repeated
by
hundreds
and
ere
they
could
be
prevented
the
contents
of
the
treasury
were
plundered
and
distributed
amongst
them
officers
and
men
alike
were
laden
with
the
spoil
in
jewels
and
money
it
was
with
bitter
regret
that
this
was
seen
by
herbert
and
many
others
whose
high
sense
of
honour
forbade
their
sharing
in
the
work
of
plunder
it
would
be
impossible
they
thought
to
conceal
such
an
event
from
the
mysore
chief
and
as
it
was
a
direct
breach
of
the
articles
they
had
solemnly
agreed
to
they
but
too
justly
anticipated
a
severe
retribution
for
the
act
it
was
even
so
on
the
morrow
as
they
marched
out
with
the
melancholy
honours
of
war
a
wasted
band
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
privation
they
were
surrounded
by
tippoo
s
troops
while
others
took
possession
of
the
fort
the
keys
of
the
magazines
and
treasures
had
been
given
up
with
the
rest
and
there
was
an
immediate
search
made
for
the
valuables
of
which
the
place
was
well
known
to
be
tippoo
personally
for
as
may
have
been
anticipated
the
guide
jaffar
was
the
means
of
the
intelligence
which
he
possessed
and
through
whom
he
had
been
informed
of
every
event
which
happened
though
his
share
in
the
previous
british
success
he
had
kept
concealed
from
the
sultaun
indeed
it
was
known
to
none
except
the
british
disappointed
at
the
issue
of
the
examination
the
english
were
at
once
suspected
and
denounced
by
jaffar
they
were
surrounded
and
rudely
searched
on
most
was
found
a

chapter
xx
abdool
rhyman
khan
as
may
be
imagined
quitted
his
wives
in
no
very
pleasant
mood
tired
by
his
long
march
and
without
having
tasted
food
since
the
morning
the
bitter
insult
he
had
received
their
disrespect
and
their
abuse
were
the
more
aggravating
and
sank
deeply
into
his
heart
although
not
a
man
of
wrath
habitually
or
one
indeed
who
could
be
easily
excited
he
was
now
in
very
truth
enraged
and
felt
that
he
would
have
given
worlds
for
any
object
on
which
he
could
have
vented
the
fury
that
possessed
him
alla
alla
he
exclaimed
as
he
ground
his
teeth
in
vexation
that
i
should
have
been
born
to
eat
this
abomination
that
i
who
have
a
grey
beard
should
be
thus
taunted
by
my
women
and
called
a
coward
one
less
than
a
man
i
who
mashalla
have
slain
men
even
feringhees
i
should
have
to
bear
hyder
ya
hoosein
i
am
a
fool
to
be
thus
excited
let
them
only
fail
to
receive
ameena
as
she
ought
to
be
me
but
have
a
pretext
for
what
i
have
long
desired
and
now
threatened
and
they
will
see
whether
my
words
are
truth
or
lies
too
long
have
i
borne
this
one
then
the
kummoo
now
one
s
mother
now
the
other
s
brothers
and
cousins
but
inshalla
this
is
the
last
dirt
i
eat
at
their
and
ungrateful
i
will
send
them
back
to
their
homes
i
have
often
threatened
it
and
now
will
do
his
horse
awaited
him
at
the
door
and
springing
into
the
saddle
he
urged
him
furiously
on
through
the
fort
gate
into
the
plain
beyond
and
the
rapid
motion
was
a
relief
to
lunged
him
round
and
round
now
exciting
him
to
speed
now
turning
him
rapidly
from
one
side
to
another
as
though
in
pursuit
of
an
imaginary
enemy
this
he
did
for
some
time
while
his
groom
and
daood
looked
quietly
on
the
latter
attributing
to
its
true
cause
the
khan
s
excitement
the
former
wondering
what
could
possess
his
master
to
ride
so
furiously
after
the
long
journey
the
horse
had
already
performed
that
morning
the
khan
at
last
from
feeling
his
temper
cooling
or
from
observing
that
his
horse
was
turning
first
towards
the
encampment
he
proceeded
a
short
distance
but
apparently
remembering
something
he
retraced
his
steps
towards
the
fort
indeed
he
had
forgotten
to
report
the
arrival
of
his
corps
to
the
officer
whose
duty
it
was
to
receive
the
intelligence
as
he
passed
his
house
he
saw
one
of
the
who
used
to
go
on
errands
or
make
purchases
in
the
bazaar
issue
from
the
and
covering
her
face
dart
on
before
him
apparently
to
elude
his
observation
ha
by
the
prophet
i
will
know
what
that
jade
is
after
muttered
the
khan
to
himself
as
he
dashed
his
heels
into
his
charger
s
flanks
and
was
up
with
her
in
a
moment
where
goest
thou
he
cried
kulloo
think
not
to
conceal
thyself
i
saw
thy
face
as
thou
camest
out
of
the
door
what
errand
hast
thou
now
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
khan
said
the
woman
i
am
only
sent
for
the
khanum
kummoo
s
mother
her
prosperity
increase
may
her
lot
be
perdition
rather
cried
the
khan
an
old
devil
never
mind
me
go
thy
way
i
know
why
she
is
called
may
the
prophet
give
them
grace
of
their
consultation
he
added
ironically
tell
thy
mistress
that
and
tell
her
too
he
continued
speaking
between
his
teeth
and
looking
back
after
he
had
gone
a
little
way
tell
her
to
remember
my
words
which
i
will
perform
if
there
be
occasion
so
help
me
alla
and
his
begone
the
woman
was
right
glad
to
escape
and
the
khan
pursued
his
way
to
the
office
where
he
had
to
make
his
report
and
to
ascertain
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
prisoners
whom
he
had
escorted
from
bangalore
this
necessarily
occupied
some
time
the
officer
was
an
intimate
friend
and
the
khan
had
not
only
much
to
learn
but
much
also
to
communicate
his
own
marriage
his
journey
his
double
escape
and
the
gallantry
of
his
young
friend
kasim
ali
were
mentioned
and
excited
the
utmost
praise
with
many
expressions
of
wonder
from
the
hearers
and
all
were
anxious
to
see
and
become
acquainted
with
the
hero
of
so
much
adventure
and
what
news
have
you
from
hyderabad
for
us
khan
sahib
said
his
friend
whose
name
was
meer
saduk
a
favourite
and
confidential
officer
of
the
sultaun
what
news
for
the
sultaun
may
his
greatness
increase
i
hope
you
were
able
to
gather
the
intentions
of
the
court
there
or
at
any
rate
can
give
us
some
idea
of
the
khan
s
journey
to
hyderabad
had
not
entirely
been
of
a
private
description
a
native
of
the
place
when
he
asked
leave
to
proceed
there
to
see
his
family
he
had
been
requested
by
the
sultaun
to
ascertain
as
far
as
he
could
the
politics
of
the
state
and
the
part
the
nizam
personally
was
likely
to
play
in
the
drama
of
indian
intrigue
and
diplomacy
and
he
had
performed
his
mission
with
more
tact
than
could
have
been
anticipated
from
his
open
and
blunt
nature
i
have
news
he
replied
meer
sahib
which
will
gratify
the
sultaun
i
think
and
from
such
good
sources
too
that
i
am
inclined
to
place
the
utmost
dependence
upon
them
no
sooner
was
it
known
that
i
as
an
officer
of
the
sircar
khodadad
had
arrived
in
the
city
than
i
was
sought
by
several
of
the
nobles
and
munsubdars
of
the
court
who
in
truth
were
friendly
to
the
last
degree
when
i
did
not
well
know
how
i
should
have
fared
with
them
and
it
appeared
from
their
speech
that
the
huzoor
himself
was
well
inclined
to
be
friendly
this
is
all
i
can
tell
you
meer
sahib
and
you
must
not
press
me
for
i
have
sworn
to
tell
the
rest
to
the
sultaun
only
after
he
has
heard
it
i
will
let
you
footnote
the
government
the
gift
of
enough
khan
i
am
content
the
sultaun
will
be
at
the
doulut
bagh
and
also
wilt
thou
come
this
evening
pardon
me
not
i
am
tired
and
have
to
arrange
my
house
after
my
journey
but
inshalla
evening
when
i
shall
present
my
young
roostum
and
solicit
employment
for
him
being
the
bearer
of
good
news
i
may
be
successful
but
in
any
case
i
think
kasim
ali
would
be
there
is
not
a
doubt
of
it
replied
his
friend
i
go
to
the
durbar
and
will
tell
of
thy
adventurous
journey
this
will
whet
the
sultaun
s
curiosity
to
see
the
young
the
friends
then
separated
in
spite
of
this
amicable
interview
the
khan
s
temper
which
had
been
so
violently
chafed
was
not
completely
soothed
the
memory
of
the
abuse
which
had
been
poured
upon
him
still
rankled
at
his
heart
and
he
was
at
a
loss
what
to
tell
ameena
of
his
interview
with
his
wives
and
of
her
having
to
meet
them
that
evening
the
nearer
he
approached
his
tents
in
the
camp
the
more
oppressive
these
thoughts
became
and
alternately
blaming
himself
for
having
visited
his
wives
so
early
after
his
arrival
and
mentally
threatening
them
with
punishment
should
they
continue
insubordinate
he
had
gradually
worked
himself
up
to
a
pitch
of
ill
temper
but
little
less
than
that
in
which
he
had
left
his
house
and
which
he
was
ready
to
discharge
upon
any
one
the
opportunity
was
not
long
wanting
for
as
he
entered
his
outer
tent
which
was
used
by
kasim
and
the
moonshees
as
well
as
by
any
visitor
or
friends
he
heard
a
violent
altercation
in
which
kasim
s
voice
and
that
of
the
moonshee
were
very
prominent
i
tell
thee
thou
art
a
cheat
and
a
rogue
kasim
was
exclaiming
with
vehemence
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
detected
thee
and
therefore
instantly
alter
these
accounts
and
repay
the
money
or
i
will
tell
the
i
am
no
cheat
nor
rogue
any
more
than
thyself
thou
nameless
retorted
the
moonshee
whose
remaining
words
were
lost
in
the
violent
passion
of
the
other
dog
thou
shalt
rue
this
cried
kasim
thou
shalt
not
escape
me
by
alla
i
will
beat
thee
with
a
and
a
scuffle
ensued
hold
exclaimed
the
khan
who
now
rushed
into
the
tent
and
parted
them
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
khodawund
cried
both
at
once
do
thou
speak
said
the
khan
thou
art
the
oldest
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
disturbance
is
this
the
bazaar
hast
thou
an
old
man
no
shame
hast
thou
too
lost
all
respect
kasim
ali
judge
if
i
have
not
cause
to
be
angry
o
khan
at
being
called
a
rogue
and
a
cheat
by
that
boy
said
the
moonshee
have
i
not
cause
to
be
enraged
when
my
character
is
thus
taken
away
wherefore
didst
thou
say
this
kasim
to
a
respectable
man
like
him
these
words
are
improper
from
such
a
youth
as
thou
khan
sahib
said
kasim
you
have
hitherto
trusted
me
implicitly
is
it
not
so
you
have
never
doubted
me
never
go
alla
is
my
witness
he
continued
i
know
no
other
motive
in
this
but
your
welfare
and
prosperity
which
first
led
me
to
inquire
in
consequence
of
my
suspicion
since
the
moonshee
has
provoked
it
and
my
lord
is
present
know
then
why
i
called
him
rogue
and
cheat
at
bangalore
by
making
notes
of
the
prices
in
the
bazaars
i
detected
him
in
overcharging
for
grain
and
forage
to
an
immense
amount
in
the
week
s
account
i
found
the
papers
here
while
my
lord
was
absent
and
for
lack
of
other
occupation
i
began
looking
over
the
items
i
see
the
same
thing
again
swears
he
will
not
alter
the
papers
and
i
was
angry
he
called
me
yes
i
heard
that
kasim
but
say
hast
thou
proof
of
all
this
behold
the
daily
memorandum
i
made
of
the
rates
khan
village
after
village
and
day
after
day
written
as
i
made
the
inquiry
the
grain
and
forage
was
i
know
bought
from
the
very
people
from
whose
lips
i
had
the
rates
call
them
if
you
are
the
bazaar
and
so
thou
wouldst
have
cheated
me
said
the
khan
his
choler
rising
rapidly
and
obstructing
his
speech
and
looking
wrathfully
at
the
trembling
moonshee
thou
who
owest
me
so
much
to
cheat
me
alla
alla
have
i
deserved
this
to
what
amount
was
the
fraud
kasim
a
hundred
rupees
or
more
khan
at
least
even
upon
this
week
s
account
i
could
not
tell
exactly
without
making
up
the
whole
i
doubt
it
not
i
doubt
it
not
and
if
this
for
one
week
or
a
little
more
what
for
the
whole
time
since
thou
hast
had
this
sole
control
of
my
horses
expenditure
my
lord
my
lord
ejaculated
the
moonshee
be
not
so
angry
your
slave
is
dares
not
speak
he
has
not
cheated
he
has
never
given
a
false
but
his
looks
belied
his
words
he
stood
a
convicted
rogue
even
while
he
tried
thus
weakly
to
assert
his
innocence
for
he
trembled
much
and
his
lips
were
blue
from
terror
we
will
soon
see
that
said
the
khan
deliberately
go
he
said
to
daood
who
stood
by
bring
two
grooms
with
whips
let
us
see
whether
they
can
not
bring
this
worthy
man
to
a
very
different
it
was
not
needed
however
the
moonshee
terrified
almost
to
speechlessness
and
not
heeding
the
interference
kasim
was
earnestly
making
in
his
behalf
prostrated
himself
on
the
ground
at
the
khan
s
feet
i
will
pay
i
will
pay
all
he
cried
i
confess
my
false
accounts
do
with
me
what
thou
wilt
but
oh
save
my
character
i
am
a
respectable
good
said
the
khan
all
of
ye
who
are
present
hear
that
he
has
confessed
himself
a
thief
before
he
was
touched
and
that
he
says
he
is
a
respectable
man
ye
will
bear
me
witness
in
respectable
moula
ali
all
answered
that
they
would
take
him
then
he
said
to
daood
and
some
of
the
furashes
who
stood
near
take
him
from
my
sight
put
him
on
an
ass
with
his
face
to
the
tail
blacken
his
face
and
show
him
in
the
bazaar
if
any
one
recognises
the
and
asks
after
his
health
say
that
he
is
taking
the
air
by
my
order
for
having
cheated
me
the
order
did
not
need
repetition
amidst
his
cries
and
protestations
against
the
sudden
sentence
the
moonshee
was
carried
off
and
in
a
few
minutes
his
face
blackened
and
set
on
an
ass
with
his
face
to
the
tail
he
was
the
sport
of
the
idlers
and
vagabonds
in
the
camp
he
had
richly
deserved
his
punishment
however
for
with
a
cunning
he
had
imagined
that
he
could
brazen
out
his
false
accounts
and
that
as
he
had
declared
that
any
division
of
the
spoil
was
at
an
end
from
the
previous
detection
he
had
made
himself
now
sure
of
the
whole
he
had
thought
too
that
kasim
contented
with
his
first
detection
of
overcharge
would
not
have
continued
his
system
of
inquiry
thus
he
was
doubly
disappointed
having
vented
his
long
rage
the
khan
soon
cooled
down
into
his
usual
pleasant
deportment
begging
kasim
to
explain
to
him
minutely
the
whole
of
the
moonshee
s
system
of
false
accounts
this
kasim
did
clearly
and
showed
him
how
much
cause
there
was
to
suspect
far
greater
delinquencies
for
months
nay
years
past
indeed
it
was
but
too
apparent
that
the
khan
had
been
defrauded
of
large
sums
and
that
the
moonshee
s
gains
must
have
been
enormous
and
this
might
have
gone
on
for
ever
kasim
but
for
thy
penetration
said
the
khan
well
thou
hast
added
another
to
the
very
good
reasons
i
already
have
for
aiding
thee
our
reception
is
to
take
place
evening
against
which
time
get
thy
best
apparel
ready
or
have
a
better
thought
wait
here
and
i
will
return
he
did
so
and
brought
with
him
a
superb
suit
of
quite
new
there
he
said
take
that
kasim
and
wear
it
it
is
the
best
kumkhab
of
aurungabad
and
was
made
for
one
of
my
nay
no
words
for
thou
hast
saved
me
far
more
than
the
cost
of
it
in
the
detection
of
yon
scoundrel
and
now
prepare
thyself
this
may
not
fit
thee
thou
canst
have
it
altered
i
shall
remove
the
khanum
to
my
house
and
sleep
there
but
come
by
the
third
watch
of
the
day
they
will
show
thee
where
it
is
and
i
will
be
ready
to
accompany
thee
inshalla
i
have
that
news
for
the
sultaun
which
shall
make
him
propitious
towards
us
and
so
saying
he
left
him
and
went
through
the
enclosure
which
separated
the
tents
into
that
which
was
appropriated
to
ameena
footnote
from
a
window
in
the
tent
which
was
screened
by
transparent
blinds
so
that
the
inmates
could
look
out
without
being
seen
ameena
was
sitting
and
gazing
on
the
plain
which
swarmed
with
men
elephants
horses
and
camels
hurrying
to
an
fro
beyond
was
the
fort
from
the
gate
of
which
every
now
and
then
issued
a
gay
cavalcade
elephant
bearing
some
officer
of
rank
surrounded
by
spearmen
and
running
footmen
a
troop
of
horsemen
who
as
they
advanced
spread
over
the
plain
and
amused
themselves
with
feats
of
horsemanship
pursuing
each
other
in
mock
combat
or
causing
their
horses
to
perform
bounds
and
caracoles
to
the
admiration
of
the
beholders
a
gallant
sight
is
it
not
fairest
and
a
gallant
and
noble
patron
of
soldiers
do
we
who
hath
not
his
equal
in
hind
say
didst
thou
ever
see
such
at
thy
city
no
in
truth
said
ameena
who
had
risen
to
receive
her
lord
but
thou
knowest
we
lived
in
a
quiet
street
of
the
city
so
that
few
cavaliers
passed
that
way
nevertheless
we
have
brave
soldiers
there
also
i
would
i
could
live
among
such
scenes
always
she
added
it
is
pleasant
to
sit
and
look
out
on
men
of
such
gallant
i
am
afraid
thou
wilt
not
see
so
much
within
the
fort
said
the
khan
nevertheless
my
house
is
in
the
main
thoroughfare
and
there
are
always
men
and
when
are
we
to
remove
there
my
lord
asked
ameena
timidly
for
she
feared
the
introduction
to
the
wives
more
than
she
dared
express
methinks
i
should
live
as
well
here
as
there
and
i
have
been
now
so
much
accustomed
to
the
tents
that
a
house
would
appear
a
confinement
to
why
fairest
thou
shouldest
remain
in
them
only
that
they
want
repair
very
much
and
we
have
prospect
of
immediate
service
besides
the
house
is
all
prepared
for
thee
and
i
long
to
make
my
rose
mistress
of
what
is
hers
in
right
so
we
will
go
thither
this
afternoon
zoolfoo
has
orders
to
prepare
our
evening
and
she
could
not
say
fear
not
they
will
be
prepared
to
receive
thee
with
honour
i
have
spoken
with
them
and
bidden
them
be
ready
to
welcome
alla
bless
them
said
ameena
the
tears
starting
to
her
eyes
and
will
they
be
kind
to
one
whom
they
ought
to
hate
alla
bless
them
i
did
not
look
for
this
but
expected
much
fear
not
said
the
khan
who
winced
under
her
artless
remark
yet
dared
not
undeceive
her
fear
not
they
will
be
kind
to
thee
inshalla
ye
will
be
sisters
alas
he
had
but
little
hope
of
this
though
he
said
it
but
it
is
necessary
to
revert
to
the
ladies
themselves
the
khan
s
two
wives
sat
in
anxious
expectation
of
the
arrival
of
the
lady
for
whom
they
had
dispatched
the
servant
they
had
held
a
hurried
colloquy
together
after
the
khan
s
departure
in
the
morning
and
had
come
to
the
resolution
of
abiding
by
the
advice
of
the
mother
of
kummoobee
who
was
the
wife
of
the
head
kazee
of
seringapatam
a
wealthy
but
corrupt
man
who
of
good
family
himself
had
married
the
daughter
of
a
poor
gentleman
of
long
descent
but
of
extreme
poverty
she
inherited
all
her
father
s
pride
of
birth
and
had
married
her
daughter
to
the
khan
only
because
of
his
rank
and
known
wealth
for
she
despised
his
low
origin
which
had
become
known
to
it
was
not
sought
to
be
concealed
as
the
ladies
waited
they
heard
the
sound
of
bearers
and
in
a
few
moments
the
jingle
of
the
anklets
and
heavy
tread
of
the
old
lady
as
she
advanced
along
the
open
verandah
of
the
court
which
led
to
their
apartment
they
rose
to
welcome
her
and
the
next
moment
she
entered
and
advanced
towards
her
starting
as
she
saw
the
khan
s
other
wife
knowing
that
they
had
been
enemies
but
returning
her
salaam
very
courteously
she
proceeded
to
take
the
evil
from
her
daughter
by
cracking
her
knuckles
over
her
having
done
this
and
embraced
she
was
led
to
the
musnud
and
being
seated
thereon
and
her
daughter
s
hooka
given
to
her
she
drew
a
long
breath
as
if
she
had
exerted
herself
very
much
and
looking
from
one
to
the
other
for
the
slaves
had
been
ordered
out
of
the
room
demanded
to
know
what
they
had
to
say
to
her
we
have
news
for
thee
mother
said
pettishly
ay
news
rare
news
added
the
other
who
seemed
as
spiteful
as
suppressed
anger
could
make
her
ajaib
said
the
old
lady
looking
from
one
to
the
other
wonderful
news
by
your
souls
tell
me
what
news
what
has
happened
that
i
know
not
of
of
the
khan
said
kummoo
edging
nearer
to
her
mother
ay
listen
said
the
other
mashalla
it
is
worth
of
the
khan
most
wonderful
is
he
dead
ye
all
his
money
no
ejaculated
kummoo
passionately
it
would
be
well
for
us
and
him
if
he
were
dead
dead
no
he
is
returned
and
well
said
the
old
lady
apparently
relieved
there
is
nothing
very
wonderful
in
particular
to
marvel
at
that
i
see
if
i
had
known
i
was
to
have
been
called
from
home
only
to
hear
this
i
can
tell
you
you
would
have
waited
long
i
had
a
thousand
things
to
do
when
kulloo
came
for
me
i
was
going
to
cook
a
dish
and
then
i
had
the
woman
with
bangles
for
my
arms
and
then
the
silversmith
was
coming
alla
alla
how
shall
i
tell
this
shame
cried
her
daughter
interrupting
her
how
shall
i
utter
the
words
to
make
it
fit
for
thee
to
hear
or
my
tongue
to
utter
alas
mother
he
has
returned
and
brought
a
woman
with
him
woman
who
inshalla
is
vile
and
ugly
and
unchaste
and
and
a
woman
thou
didst
not
say
a
woman
another
wife
cried
the
old
lady
interrupting
the
torrent
of
foul
names
which
once
the
subject
of
them
had
been
named
followed
rapidly
enough
so
he
says
mother
cried
hoormut
another
wife
he
dared
not
write
this
to
either
of
us
he
dared
not
tell
us
how
he
had
misused
us
how
he
had
cheated
us
he
dared
not
tell
us
this
and
we
heard
it
only
from
my
cousin
who
discovered
it
at
nundidroog
and
wrote
to
the
i
will
throw
ashes
on
his
will
fill
his
mouth
with
earth
i
will
spit
on
him
cried
the
old
lady
who
having
looked
from
the
one
to
the
other
was
now
excited
to
fury
at
this
sudden
intelligence
ya
alla
kereem
what
dirt
has
he
not
eaten
what
abomination
have
ye
also
to
bear
o
my
daughters
married
again
another
wife
a
young
one
i
ll
warrant
the
old
lecher
oh
shame
shame
on
his
grey
hairs
may
dogs
defile
them
and
beautiful
too
i
have
no
doubt
is
there
no
law
is
there
no
justice
inshalla
we
will
see
to
that
is
he
to
throw
dirt
on
the
family
of
the
chief
kazee
and
cause
his
daughter
to
eat
grief
is
he
to
mock
us
to
cheat
us
to
bring
his
vile
women
before
our
very
faces
without
we
turn
and
strike
again
are
we
cows
and
sheep
inshalla
no
but
persons
of
good
family
of
a
hundred
descents
while
he
is
a
poor
pitiful
wretch
and
she
paused
fairly
exhausted
from
want
of
breath
ay
mother
said
and
what
is
more
he
has
threatened
to
bring
her
here
into
this
very
make
us
see
her
and
welcome
i
could
cry
with
here
it
is
a
lie
roared
the
old
lady
it
is
a
lie
this
is
some
trick
of
yours
or
joke
i
will
not
believe
that
is
he
mad
to
do
it
it
is
the
truth
however
said
hoormut
and
what
is
more
he
swore
by
alla
and
the
prophet
s
beard
if
we
did
not
receive
her
kindly
he
would
send
us
both
home
to
our
parents
and
let
them
support
us
for
he
would
at
least
need
not
care
about
said
kummoo
pointedly
and
spitefully
inshalla
i
shall
always
find
food
and
clothes
there
people
mashalla
are
not
with
the
other
it
was
different
for
her
family
were
poor
and
had
been
ruinously
extravagant
and
even
their
mutual
dilemma
could
not
prevent
this
expression
of
spite
from
her
richer
i
should
like
to
know
retorted
hoormut
tartly
who
could
not
at
any
other
time
a
quarrel
would
have
resulted
to
a
certainty
but
now
kummoo
s
mother
spoke
again
fortunately
for
the
general
peace
so
he
threatened
that
did
he
and
what
said
ye
added
the
old
lady
more
calmly
for
in
truth
the
sudden
vision
of
her
daughter
s
return
to
her
house
which
the
words
she
had
just
heard
caused
were
not
by
any
means
agreeable
mother
we
could
say
nothing
for
he
left
us
replied
her
daughter
and
we
have
sent
for
you
to
ask
your
advice
as
to
what
we
should
do
said
kummoo
wiping
her
eyes
with
the
end
of
her
doputta
humph
said
the
old
lady
after
a
pause
and
some
most
vigorous
pulls
at
the
hooka
ending
in
a
discharge
of
smoke
through
her
nostrils
do
you
know
whether
the
girl
is
beautiful
we
hear
she
is
said
hoormut
very
reluctantly
and
with
an
indignant
toss
of
her
head
which
was
repeated
by
the
other
lady
then
there
is
no
use
to
resist
my
daughters
the
old
fool
is
bewitched
with
her
and
all
you
can
do
is
to
bear
the
such
it
you
can
revenge
it
ay
revenge
it
thou
art
no
daughter
of
mine
kummoo
if
thou
canst
bear
this
like
a
thing
i
never
suffered
any
one
to
come
between
me
and
thy
father
he
tried
it
more
than
once
but
mashalla
he
got
tired
of
and
so
thou
wouldst
have
me
bear
it
mother
said
kummoo
bursting
into
a
torrent
of
tears
the
effects
of
her
vexation
i
had
expected
different
advice
from
thee
how
can
i
bear
to
meet
the
vile
creature
whom
i
could
spit
upon
and
beat
with
a
shoe
how
to
lose
my
power
influence
money
clothes
jewels
of
which
will
be
lavished
on
this
child
how
can
i
eat
the
dirt
which
the
very
seeing
her
will
occasion
mother
i
tell
thee
true
i
can
not
and
i
will
not
bear
it
i
will
appeal
to
my
father
and
to
the
sultaun
if
he
will
not
hear
patience
my
child
patience
said
the
old
lady
soothingly
not
so
in
good
time
it
is
better
to
eat
dirt
for
one
night
than
all
thy
life
why
shouldst
thou
be
afraid
mashalla
thou
art
art
of
perfect
art
not
old
inshalla
wait
therefore
let
this
novelty
wear
off
and
he
will
return
to
both
of
you
inshalla
inshalla
meanwhile
i
will
consult
thy
father
i
will
see
if
the
law
can
avail
thee
aught
but
for
the
the
sake
of
the
thy
temper
wouldst
thou
not
eat
dirt
for
of
ye
i
he
turned
ye
out
to
your
homes
what
would
not
be
said
verily
that
ye
were
vile
and
worthless
and
that
he
had
detected
you
in
his
absence
therefore
wait
inshalla
and
the
prophet
we
will
be
revenged
i
who
am
your
mother
say
this
on
him
and
her
we
will
have
our
exchange
for
this
if
charms
or
spells
or
what
is
better
women
s
wit
can
effect
quickly
then
mother
by
your
soul
devise
something
i
shall
live
in
misery
till
thou
dost
and
we
will
aid
thee
is
it
not
so
sister
i
promise
to
do
all
ye
wish
of
me
returned
hoormut
i
am
in
your
hands
alas
i
have
now
no
mother
whom
i
can
consult
you
are
my
only
mother
lady
and
she
began
to
sob
do
not
cry
daughter
said
the
dame
rising
majestically
inshalla
we
shall
prosper
yet
alla
hafiz
i
go
to
think
over
the
matter
and
consult
my
faithful
ummun
she
is
wise
and
to
her
i
am
indebted
for
many
a
charm
without
which
it
would
have
fared
ill
with
me
i
will
send
her
and
thou
canst
tell
her
what
happened
when
he
brought
her
and
what
she
is
like
and
so
saying
she
left
them
since
we
are
to
see
her
said
kummoo
who
had
been
hiding
her
vexation
by
looking
out
of
the
window
to
watch
her
mother
s
departure
and
to
behold
her
triumph
over
us
we
must
only
eat
our
own
vexation
and
make
the
best
of
the
matter
let
us
prepare
the
khan
has
ordered
the
will
get
some
garlands
and
salute
them
if
we
are
not
to
be
revenged
at
once
by
insulting
them
both
at
least
let
us
pretend
civility
which
may
blind
them
to
our
ultimate
excellent
advice
sister
said
hoormut
who
though
the
elder
yet
had
lost
much
of
her
authority
to
the
younger
and
far
handsomer
kummoo
let
us
make
a
rejoicing
of
and
play
to
them
and
put
on
our
best
clothes
we
shall
not
fail
to
please
the
best
clothes
echoed
kummoo
alas
the
time
for
those
is
gone
we
may
even
have
to
wear
suits
for
want
of
better
no
more
clothes
no
more
jewels
she
added
pettishly
but
what
matters
it
revenge
will
follow
hoormut
thy
advice
is
good
we
will
prepare
for
the
pah
i
have
no
patience
to
mention
and
so
they
did
a
clean
covering
was
put
upon
the
musnud
the
crimson
velvet
pillows
of
state
occasions
laid
upon
it
the
khan
s
gold
pāndān
and
uttrdān
set
out
and
their
costly
hookas
arranged
near
them
all
the
slaves
were
desired
to
put
on
clean
clothes
and
they
themselves
dressed
in
their
most
sumptuous
apparel
and
adorned
with
all
their
jewels
were
seated
about
the
time
of
evening
in
the
room
which
on
that
morning
had
been
the
scene
of
so
violent
an
altercation
trembling
for
the
issue
of
the
event
but
cheered
by
the
khan
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
the
gentle
ameena
accompanied
him
about
dusk
to
his
abode
in
the
fort
the
palankeen
was
set
down
in
the
and
the
bearers
having
retired
she
essayed
to
get
out
of
it
but
could
hardly
support
her
trembling
limbs
one
or
two
of
the
women
servants
however
kindly
assisted
her
and
a
cup
of
cool
water
refreshed
her
the
khan
too
had
now
arrived
and
veiling
herself
closely
she
followed
him
into
the
apartment
which
had
been
prepared
the
khan
had
been
uncertain
what
would
be
the
issue
until
he
reached
the
room
but
he
had
determined
if
necessary
to
carry
his
threat
into
execution
a
glance
however
assured
him
that
all
was
right
the
ladies
rose
courteously
made
them
low
salaams
and
advanced
to
meet
them
and
as
he
led
forward
the
shrinking
girl
they
took
her
kindly
by
the
hand
with
many
warm
welcomes
and
blessings
and
despite
of
her
protestations
to
the
contrary
seated
her
upon
the
place
of
honour
and
themselves
at
her
feet
this
done
a
slave
advanced
with
a
tray
of
garlands
of
the
sweet
moteea
one
of
which
they
hung
around
her
neck
while
they
again
salaamed
to
her
and
the
slaves
one
by
one
did
the
same
the
khan
too
underwent
these
ceremonies
with
delight
for
he
had
little
expected
such
a
greeting
the
ladies
at
last
were
seated
and
kummoo
said
let
us
i
pray
thee
sister
see
the
face
of
which
report
hath
spoken
so
warmly
unveil
i
beseech
thee
that
we
may
look
on
our
new
it
is
not
worth
seeing
said
the
timid
girl
throwing
back
the
end
of
her
doputta
nevertheless
your
kindness
and
welcome
is
so
great
that
i
can
not
refuse
ya
alla
cried
one
and
all
how
beautiful
for
they
were
really
struck
with
her
appearance
and
could
not
restrain
their
sincere
expression
of
admiration
at
her
loveliness
mashalla
the
khan
has
good
kummoo
the
principal
speaker
and
the
youngest
of
the
two
wives
was
beautiful
too
but
her
flashing
eyes
full
person
and
rather
dark
skin
though
her
features
were
regular
could
but
ill
stand
a
comparison
with
the
gentle
beauty
exquisite
though
small
proportions
and
fair
skin
of
ameena
and
the
khan
s
eye
which
wandered
from
one
to
the
other
for
a
few
moments
rested
at
last
on
ameena
with
a
look
so
full
of
admiration
that
it
did
kummoo
s
notice
she
of
course
said
nothing
but
the
venom
of
her
heart
arose
with
more
bitterness
than
ever
ay
she
is
fair
said
the
khan
and
gentle
as
she
is
fair
i
am
thankful
that
ye
seem
already
to
love
her

sat

kasim
attended
closely
to
the
advice
of
the
khan
and
spared
no
pains
on
the
day
which
was
to
fix
his
fate
and
rank
in
the
service
to
adorn
his
person
to
the
best
advantage
the
splendid
brocade
suit
which
the
khan
had
given
crimson
silk
with
large
gold
flowers
upon
it
the
most
expensive
the
looms
of
aurungabad
could
had
found
to
fit
him
so
nearly
that
it
required
but
few
alterations
which
were
easily
made
this
therefore
he
was
able
to
wear
around
his
head
was
a
mundeel
or
turban
of
gauze
and
gold
in
alternate
stripes
the
colour
of
the
gauze
was
green
which
marked
his
descent
as
a
syud
and
it
was
an
additional
reason
beyond
his
own
pride
in
the
matter
for
thus
openly
showing
it
that
the
sultaun
in
his
zeal
for
the
faith
was
particularly
partial
to
the
race
the
mundeel
was
of
the
richest
and
most
expensive
kind
and
its
costly
fabric
suited
well
with
the
appearance
of
the
brocade
suit
he
had
bound
it
too
in
the
most
approved
and
genteel
worn
by
the
nobility
of
the
dekhan
and
which
is
called
under
his
chin
and
tied
on
the
top
of
his
head
so
as
to
protect
the
ears
he
wore
a
benares
gift
of
his
purple
and
silver
the
glittering
ends
of
which
fluttered
in
the
breeze
as
he
walked
while
the
colour
contrasted
well
with
his
fair
skin
his
waist
was
girded
by
a
crimson
muslin
doputta
or
scarf
with
gold
ends
nearly
a
foot
long
richly
embroidered
which
hung
down
on
one
side
and
were
displayed
to
the
best
advantage
a
pair
of
trousers
of
yellow
mushroo
or
thick
satin
striped
with
crimson
completed
a
costume
which
for
its
splendour
could
not
well
be
surpassed
and
which
displayed
his
striking
figure
and
handsome
face
to
the
best
advantage
the
baldric
which
held
his
father
s
trusty
sword
was
tarnished
to
be
sure
but
that
was
a
mark
of
its
having
seen
service
and
it
was
the
more
honourable
in
appearance
on
that
account
its
gold
inlaid
hilt
had
been
newly
polished
and
the
crimson
velvet
scabbard
renewed
and
it
looked
as
indeed
it
was
a
handsome
as
well
as
most
formidable
weapon
from
its
great
length
and
breadth
two
or
three
daggers
with
richly
chased
and
ornamented
handles
occupied
a
conspicuous
place
in
his
girdle
his
shield
hung
loosely
at
his
back
and
thus
accoutred
he
mounted
the
gallant
horse
which
the
khan
had
provided
for
him
and
which
had
not
only
been
more
richly
caparisoned
than
usual
but
decked
with
a
profusion
of
silver
ornaments
and
took
his
way
into
the
fort
many
an
eye
was
turned
towards
him
as
he
passed
along
for
the
proud
animal
he
rode
apparently
aware
that
the
appearance
of
his
rider
warranted
more
than
usual
exertion
and
excited
by
the
clashing
and
jingling
of
the
silver
ornaments
and
tiny
bells
around
his
neck
and
upon
his
crupper
bounded
to
and
fro
curvetted
and
pranced
as
much
to
show
off
his
own
unexceptionable
shape
as
to
display
his
rider

admirable
and
easy
horsemanship
to
the
best
advantage
a
gallant
cavalier
cried
one
as
he
passed
near
the
gate
of

fort
loud
enough
for

to
hear
it

lost
the
rest
of

sentence
as
he
passed
on

it
proved
to
him
and
not
unpleasantly
that
the
only
action
he
had
as

performed
worthy
of
note
was
known
if

exclaimed

of

and
who
in
all
the

of

and

and

lustrous
eyes
even
made

eyes
cried
first
one
and
then
another
until
kasim
whose
horse
had
become
uneasy
at
this
volley
of
words
and
at
the
jingling
and
clashing
of
the
bells
around
the
bullock
s
necks
or
attached
to
the
posts
and
crimson
curtains
of
the

curvetted
once
or
twice
so
as
to
cause
a
few
faint
shrieks
and
afterwards
a
burst
of
merry
laughter
from
the
fair
on
and
freed
him
from
them
passing
hastily
through
the
gateway
he
rode
on
into
the
through
an
open
space
where
in
heaps
cannon
mounted
on
carriages
and
soldiers
moving
in
all
directions
showed
the
efficient
state
of
the
fort
for
defence
beyond
this
was
the
streets
of
goodly
houses
the
lower
parts
of
which
were
shops
and
where
all
sorts
of
grain
rich
clothes
tobacco
brazen
pans
and
arms
of
all
kinds
were
exposed
for
sale
as
he
rode
along
slowly
through
the
which
his
appearance
attracted
much
notice
and
many
flattering
could
not
but
observe
that
every
house
was
gaudily
ornamented
with
paintings
which
were
a
proof
if
any
was
needed
in
what
hatred
the
english
were
held
by
all
here
were
represented
a
row
of
feringhees
their
hands
tied
behind
them
and
with
their
faces
half
blackened
while
others
were
seated
on
asses
with
their
faces
to
the
tail
again
there
were
some
being
torn
to
pieces
by
tigers
while
men
of
the
true
faith
looked
on
and
applauded
others
were
under
the
feet
or
chained
to
the
legs
of
elephants
one
to
each
leg
while
the
beast
was
depicted
at
his
utmost
speed
his
trunk
raised
into
the
air
and
the
mahout
evading
him
with
a
huge
ankoos
again
another
row
were
undergoing
the
rite
of
mahomedanism
at
the
hands
of
the
kazee
others
were
suffering
torture
several
appeared
drawn
up
in
a
line
whose
heads
were
all
falling
to
the
ground
under
one
vigorous
blow
of
the
man
of
the
true
faith
with
a
huge
beard
and
mustachios
curling
up
to
his
eyes
while
streams
of
gore
very
red
and
much
higher
and
thicker
than
the
sufferers
themselves
gushed
from
the
bodies
here
again
were
a
group
of
ten
or
twelve
seated
round
a
table
each
with
a
fierce
regimental
upon
his
head
a
very
red
and
drunken
face
and
his
right
hand
upraised
grasping
a
huge
glass
filled
with
red
wine
while
others
overcome
by
inebriation
were
sprawling
under
the
table
and
wallowing
among
the
swine
and
dogs
which
lay
at
the
feet
of
those
who
were
yet
able
to
preserve
their
equilibrium
kasim
was
amused
at
all
this
and
if
he
could
not
enter
into
the
general
hatred
with
all
the
zest
of
one
of
tippoo
s
soldiers
perhaps
it
was
that
the
remembrance
of
the
young
englishman
whom
we
have
mentioned
rose
in
his
mind
as
he
looked
on
these
disgusting
and
indecent
pictures
of
his
race
with
far
different
feelings
than
they
were
calculated
to
engender
in
a
syud
and
a
true
believer
as
he
passed
on
the
tall
minarets
of
the
mosque
built
by
hyder
ali
khan
towered
above
him
which
pierced
from
top
to
bottom
with
after
the
manner
of
those
in
arabia
were
surrounded
by
thousands
of
pigeons
of
all
colours
and
kinds
wheeling
hither
and
thither
in
the
air
in
immense
flocks
whilst
others
sat
quietly
cooing
in
the
niches
and
enjoying
their
abode
unmolested
soon
afterwards
he
emerged
from
the
narrow
street
into
the
square
the
futteh
mydan
or
plain
of
victory
on
one
side
of
which
was
the
long
line
of
the
sultaun
s
palace
presenting
nothing
to
the
observer
but
a
line
of
dead
wall
with
many
windows
whose
closed
shutters
showed
they
were
the
zenana
around
the
gate
however
were
many
guards
dressed
in
the
striped
calico
in
use
among
his
bodyguard
of
regular
infantry
interspersed
with
men
in
richer
dresses
and
armour
of
the
irregular
troops
who
were
permitted
to
share
the
watch
over
the
monarch
s
abode
in
the
centre
of
the
square
were
a
number
of
men
under
instruction
whose
evolutions
with
the
words
of
command
were
quite
new
to
kasim
and
inspired
him
with
great
admiration
at
the
other
side
of
the
square
the
venerable
forms
of
the
ancient
hindoo
temples
reared
their
huge
conical
and
richly
ornamented
roofs
and
around
their
massy
gates
and
in
the
courts
lounged
many
a
sleek
and
brahmin
whose
closely
shaven
and
shining
head
and
body
naked
to
the
only
a
long
white
muslin
cloth
tied
around
his
loins
with
its
end
thrown
over
his
him
to
be
in
the
service
of
the
enshrined
divinity
whose
worship
was
not
forbidden
by
the
fanatical
ruler
of
the
it
was
even
whispered
shared
in
by
him
the
khan
s
house
was
not
far
from
the
temple
in
one
of
the
chief
streets
and
having
announced
his
arrival
to
the
kasim
continued
riding
up
and
down
before
it
till
the
khan
should
issue
forth
to
accompany
him
this
was
then
the
place
where
ameena
was
secured
he
thought
the
gentle
lovely
being
on
whose
fair
face
his
eye
had
rested
only
a
few
times
yet
each
glance
however
short
its
duration
had
been
was
treasured
up
in
the
inmost
shrine
of
his
heart
as
long
as
she
remained
in
the
camp
he
might
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
her
even
though
for
a
moment
and
of
displaying
the
scarf
she
had
given
to
mute
evidence
which
would
prove
to
her
she
was
not
forgotten
for
he
had
continued
to
wear
it
tied
around
his
chest
as
at
first
even
though
his
slight
wound
was
so
far
healed
as
to
require
nothing
but
a
bandage
underneath
his
vest
it
had
been
even
a
comfort
to
him
to
watch
the
arrival
of
her
palankeen
daily
in
the
camp
and
before
that
to
busy
himself
in
writing
the
despatch
for
the
furashes
who
prepared
the
tents
for
her
reception
sometimes
as
she
got
out
of
her
palankeen
he
would
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
muffled
figure
or
hear
the
chink
of
her
gold
anklets
and
even
this
would
be
pleasant
to
him
but
now
there
was
no
hope
she
had
passed
within
those
walls
which
had
he
thought
for
ever
shut
her
from
his
sight
and
while
his
memory
was
busy
with
the
past
he
strove
under
the
weight
of
obligation
with
which
the
khan
had
loaded
him
and
which
that
day
would
be
augmented
to
drive
away
the
thoughts
of
his
fair
wife
not
however
with
the
success
which
ought
to
have
attended
his
efforts
indeed
the
beautiful
image
of
her
face
was
too
deeply
fixed
upon
his
memory
and
the
fears
that
her
lot
so
young
and
as
she
was
in
the
companionship
of
her
lord
s
older
and
wives
would
not
be
a
happy
one
made
him
again
determine
that
in
need
or
danger
she
might
rely
on
one
who
would
be
true
to
her
every
now
and
then
he
cast
up
his
eyes
to
the
lattices
to
see
if
perchance
any
one
looked
out
from
thence
but
there
was
no
one
and
he
continued
his
slow
pace
to
and
fro
in
a
short
time
however
his
reverie
was
interrupted
by
the
cheerful
voice
of
the
khan
who
fully
armed
was
splendidly
dressed
in
a
suit
of
bright
over
a
tunic
of
a
steel
cap
glittered
on
his
head
from
the
sides
of
which
to
his
neck
descended
lappets
of
strengthened
with
scales
his
long
straight
sword
was
suspended
in
an
embroidered
baldric
and
his
waist
was
girded
by
a
green
and
gold
scarf
similar
to
that
kasim
wore
he
greeted
kasim
heartily
by
the
prophet
thou
art
no
disgrace
to
me
and
the
ulkhaluk
becomes
thee
a
green
mundeel
is
well
as
thou
art
a
syud
and
hast
a
right
to
wear
it
i
would
thou
hadst
a
pair
of
persian
boots
like
as
thou
art
they
would
not
fit
thee
nor
suit
thy
dress
so
now
let
us
see
thee
make
my
yacoot
bound
a
as
kasim
complied
with
his
request
the
delight
of
the
khan
and
his
retainers
who
had
now
assembled
was
extreme
and
cries
of
shabash
shabash
wah
wah
wah
wah
rewarded
his
exertions
indeed
kasim
s
horsemanship
like
that
of
most
dekhanie
s
was
perfect
and
he
sat
his
excited
horse
with
the
ease
and
grace
of
one
who
was
completely
at
home
upon
his
back
in
spite
of
his
extreme
spirit
and
violence
as
the
khan
prepared
to
mount
kasim
happened
once
more
to
cast
his
eyes
up
toward
the
lattices
which
looked
into
the
street
they
were
guarded
with
transparent
blinds
but
nevertheless
he
thought
he
could
distinguish
one
or
more
female
figures
behind
each
and
his
heart
beat
very
rapidly
as
he
was
ameena
beheld
him
it
was
not
an
unpleasant
thought
that
she
looked
upon
him
richly
dressed
and
accoutred
as
he
was
and
had
seen
him
exhibit
his
spirited
horsemanship
to
the
khan
again
he
for
a
moment
with
an
apparent
pretence
of
arranging
the
blind
the
corner
was
drawn
inwards
a
face
which
was
new
to
yet
very
and
a
pair
of
large
flashing
eyes
threw
a
glance
towards
him
which
met
his
it
was
not
ameena
s
and
he
was
disappointed
but
he
could
not
the
less
remember
afterwards
the
glance
he
had
received
from
eyes
so
bold
and
so
commanding
and
the
older
yet
beautiful
face
and
remarkable
expression
and
involuntarily
sought
it
again
the
khan
however
at
the
moment
he
saw
it
called
to
him
to
proceed
and
the
spearmen
and
running
footmen
and
grooms
having
arranged
themselves
in
front
they
set
forward
at
a
quick
pace
followed
by
the
khan
s
retainers
who
were
almost
as
well
mounted
though
not
so
richly
clothed
as
themselves
those
in
front
shouting
the
khan
s
titles
and
clearing
the
way
often
with
rude
blows
of
the
heavy
they
retraced
kasim
s
steps
through
the
bazaars
where
the
profusion
of
salaams
and
compliments
which
greeted
them
showed
how
greatly
the
khan
was
respected
and
esteemed
and
the
various
cries
of
the
fakeers
who
appealed
to
him
by
name
as
they
solicited
charity
and
mentioned
many
of
his
valiant
acts
in
and
laudatory
terms
proved
how
well
his
brave
deeds
were
known
to
all
kasim
also
came
in
for
his
share
and
as
his
connection
with
the
khan
was
mentioned
truly
and
the
subsequent
engagement
with
the
mahrattas
it
was
plain
that
it
had
become
known
to
those
rapid
acquirers
of
topics
for
gossip
the
fakeers
and
had
already
become
the
common
talk
of
the
bazaars
issuing
from
the
fort
they
escaped
from
this
in
a
great
measure
yet
here
and
there
along
the
road
sat
a
fakeer
or
kalundur
with
his
felt
cap
and
quilted
chequered
gown
of
many
colours
who
with
a
sheet
spread
before
him
upon
which
was
a
cup
solicited
the
alms
of
the
true
believers
alternately
with
prayers
threats
or
abuse
as
the
quality
of
the
warranted
instead
of
taking
the
road
to
the
right
which
led
to
the
camp
they
struck
off
to
the
left
and
after
a
few
minutes
ride
arrived
at
the
gate
of
the
garden
of
the
or
sea
of
wealth
by
the
river
side
where
for
the
day
the
sultaun
held
his
court
this
palace
which
had
been
erected
by
his
father
many
years
before
stood
in
the
centre
of
a
garden
of
great
beauty
which
from
the
richness
of
the
soil
and
plentiful
supply
of
water
brought
from
the
river
by
a
deep
flourished
in
the
utmost
luxuriance
large
trees
mango
and
tamarind
walnut
and
the
chumpa
with
many
other
forest
kinds
distinguished
for
their
beauty
of
growth
or
the
fragrance
or
luxuriance
of
their
foliage
and
blossom
with
large
clumps
of
feathering
bamboos
overshadowed
the
broad
walks
and
long
green
alleys
and
in
the
hottest
weather
formed
an
almost
impervious
shade
while
the
coolness
was
increased
by
the
constant
irrigation
and
consequent
evaporation
from
the
ground
passing
through
the
gate
the
khan
and
kasim
rode
down
the
avenue
at
the
end
of
which
was
the
palace
they
could
not
see
the
extent
of
it
nor
was
there
anything
remarkable
in
the
outward
appearance
which
corresponded
at
all
with
the
splendour
within
the
building
was
two
storeys
high
the
lower
of
which
was
occupied
by
kitchens
halls
for
servants
and
long
upper
contained
the
rooms
of
state
a
projecting
roof
which
was
supported
by
carved
wooden
pillars
formed
a
deep
verandah
which
was
occupied
by
a
crowd
of
and
those
who
attended
either
with
petitions
or
upon
business
and
whose
rich
and
gay
dresses
contrasted
well
with
the
dark
foliage
which
almost
swept
the
ground
near
them
behold
the
triumph
of
art
cried
the
khan
as
they
dismounted
and
approached
the
building
and
kasim
could
see
that
the
walls
were
covered
with
paintings
there
are
not
such
paintings
in
hind
thanks
to
hyder
ali
his
place
in
heaven
be
blessed
and
his
grave
honoured
behold
the
whole
of
the
rout
of
the
kafir
english
at
perambaukum
where
praise
be
to
alla
the
arms
of
the
true
believers
were
completely
victorious
and
thousands
of
the
kafirs
tasted
of
death
at
their
hands
yonder
is
baillie
and
his
troops
you
can
see
baillie
in
the
centre
mashalla
he
was
a
great
man
so
indeed
he
and
the
other
leaders
appeared
for
they
were
much
larger
than
the
troops
yonder
are
the
valiant
assud
illahee
of
the
great
hyder
the
disciplined
troops
before
which
the
english
battalions
are
only
as
chaff
behold
they
are
advancing
to
the
attack
and
bear
down
all
before
them
there
are
the
guns
too
pouring
fire
on
the
devoted
feringhees
and
the
rockets
flying
in
the
air
which
overwhelm
them
with
confusion
in
the
midst
of
the
fire
the
cavalry
of
the
sircar
led
on
by
the
young
tippoo
are
charging
and
hyder
himself
is
animating
the
attack
by
his
presence
on
his
elephant
and
look
there
he
continued
pointing
to
another
part
of
the
wall
after
kasim
had
expressed
his
admiration
at
the
rare
skill
of
the
artist
who
had
delineated
so
many
figures
that
is
the
end
of
the
affair
as
the
end
of
all
like
affairs
ever
will
be
the
kafirs
are
being
cut
to
pieces
while
their
blood
is
poured
out
upon
the
earth
like
this
indeed
was
pretty
evident
from
the
prostrate
forms
of
the
europeans
and
the
figures
of
the
mahomedans
hacking
at
them
with
swords
rather
larger
than
themselves
while
large
daubs
of
red
paint
showed
how
indeed
the
blood
had
been
poured
forth
like
water
the
figures
being
all
in
profile
had
considerably
exercised
the
ingenuity
of
the
artist
to
express
what
he
meant
alla
kureem
ejaculated
kasim
at
last
who
was
mightily
struck
with
the
magnitude
of
the
drawings
the
lines
of
charging
cavalry
all
with
their
fore
feet
in
the
bodies
of
infantry
which
marched
in
all
kinds
of
lines
to
the
attack
with
their
right
legs
smoke
of
the
guns
that
obscured
rockets
flying
in
the
air
with
fiery
elephants
and
the
general
s
officers
some
of
whom
were
bigger
than
the
elephants
they
horses
and
their
whole
battle
of
which
from
the
peculiarity
of
the
perspective
it
was
difficult
to
say
whether
it
was
on
the
earth
or
in
the
sky
alla
kureem
it
was
a
great
battle
and
this
is
a
wonderful
the
designer
s
prosperity
increase
ay
you
may
well
say
that
continued
the
khan
and
behold
here
are
the
feringhees
in
captivity
all
wounded
but
enduring
life
there
they
are
brought
before
hyder
the
victorious
who
seated
on
his
throne
allows
the
officers
to
live
while
the
soldiers
he
orders
to
be
dispatched
to
the
regions
of
perdition
by
the
executioner
yonder
are
a
row
kneeling
in
terror
while
the
sword
is
brandished
behind
them
which
shall
cause
them
to
taste
the
bitterness
of
death
there
again
are
others
under
torture
and
those
who
are
spared
by
the
clemency
of
the
exalted
in
rank
going
into
a
deserved
captivity
those
we
brought
were
then
some
of
them
said
kasim
no
i
think
not
i
rather
believe
they
were
all
discharged
or
most
of
them
at
the
peace
four
years
ago
these
are
some
who
if
i
mistake
not
were
taken
at
bednore
when
mathews
was
surrounded
and
obliged
to
yield
himself
to
the
sultaun
however
we
shall
soon
know
for
i
have
heard
that
judgment
is
to
be
done
on
them
but
come
the
durbar
is
open
we
have
much
to
do
and
to
see
others
are
pressing
on
before
us
and
we
shall
lose
our
place
so
saying
he
led
the
way
by
one
side
of
the
building
to
a
flight
of
broad
stairs
under
the
cover
of
a
verandah
and
they
ascended
amidst
the
crowd
of
courtiers
and
military
officers
who
were
thronging
to
the
durbar
for
proclamation
was
being
made
as
they
waited
without
and
the
cries
of
the
chobdars
of
announced
to
all
that
the
sultaun
had
taken
his
seat
the
head
of
the
stairs
opened
at
once
into
the
hall
of
audience
so
that
when
they
reached
the
top
the
scene
burst
fully
upon
them
to
the
khan
there
was
nothing
new
in
it
but
to
kasim
who
had
never
seen
anything
grander
than
his
own
village
or
at
most
the
town
of
adoni
the
effect
was
dazzling
and
overpowering
the
room
was
large
but
low
in
its
proportions
the
walls
were
of
that
beautiful
stucco
which
is
only
to
be
seen
in
perfection
in
the
south
of
india
and
which
from
its
high
polish
and
exquisite
whiteness
so
nearly
resembles
the
purest
marble
this
was
wrought
into
most
elaborate
designs
of
arabesque
work
and
the
sharp
edges
of
every
flower
leaf
and
line
were
picked
out
with
a
faint
line
of
pure
vermilion
here
and
there
relieved
with
gold
which
gave
a
peculiar
but
agreeable
effect
to
the
ornament
in
the
niches
and
compartments
into
which
the
walls
were
divided
upon
the
deep
cornices
and
especially
around
the
open
arched
windows
the
patterns
were
more
intricate
and
delicate
than
elsewhere
the
windows
themselves
were
without
frames
and
were
open
to
the
garden
which
in
all
its
beauty
and
luxuriance
could
be
seen
through
them
and
they
admitted
the
cool
breeze
to
play
through
the
room
which
otherwise
from
its
crowded
state
would
have
been
insufferably
hot
heavy
purdahs
or
gilded
curtains
of
crimson
cloth
hung
above
them
which
could
be
let
down
so
as
to
exclude
the
air
completely
if
required
the
ceiling
was
covered
with
and
arabesque
patterns
of
stucco
in
chequers
from
the
intersections
of
which
depended
a
small
stalactite
decorated
like
the
walls
with
red
and
gold
this
while
it
caused
a
heavy
effect
to
the
room
was
nevertheless
extremely
rich
and
handsome
the
floor
was
covered
with
rich
carpets
to
about
one
half
of
its
length
where
commenced
a
white
muslin
cloth
on
which
none
dared
to
venture
but
those
whose
rank
or
station
about
the
monarch
entitled
them
to
that
honour
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
was
a
raised
dais
which
was
covered
like
the
floor
with
white
muslin
but
in
the
centre
of
it
was
a
square
carpet
of
rich
purple
velvet
surrounded
with
soft
cushions
also
of
velvet
upon
which
sat
tippoo
alike
the
pride
and
the
dread
of
those
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
kasim
easily
distinguished
the
of
the
previous
day
in
the
person
before
him
but
he
was
dressed
with
extreme
plainness
in
white
muslin
and
would
not
have
been
taken
for
the
sultaun
by
a
stranger
except
from
the
place
he
occupied
and
the
large
and
turban
with
which
every
one
was
familiar
from
description
on
each
side
of
him
knelt
two
fair
and
youths
dressed
in
gorgeous
apparel
the
children
of
europeans
captured
on
various
occasions
who
forcibly
converted
to
mahomedanism
always
attended
the
sultaun
and
waved
chowrees
formed
of
the
white
tail
of
the
tibet
cow
with
gold
handles
on
all
sides
of
him
to
drive
away
the
flies
on
each
side
of
the
dais
in
semicircles
sat
the
officers
of
state
and
of
the
army
in
their
various
costumes
leaving
an
open
space
in
the
centre
through
which
those
passed
who
desired
to
present
their
nuzzurs
to
the
sultaun
some
french
officers
were
there
in
glittering
uniforms
but
whose
clothes
bare
heads
and
feet
without
boots
or
shoes
looked
meanly
amidst
the
turbaned
heads
and
more
graceful
costume
of
the
courtiers
behind
all
were
a
number
of
the
royal
chelas
or
bodyguard
splendidly
dressed
and
armed
to
the
teeth
whose
formidable
appearance
completely
awed
the
assembly
if
indeed
the
presence
of
the
sultaun
himself
was
not
sufficient
to
produce
that
effect
the
figure
of
the
sultaun
was
of
middle
height
and
stout
his
complexion
was
darker
than
that
of
most
of
those
who
surrounded
him
and
he
sat
with
an
affected
air
of
royalty
which
though
it
at
first
impressed
the
spectator
with
awe
yet
that
passed
away
in
a
great
measure
upon
the
contemplation
of
his
face
which
wanted
the
dignity
of
expression
that
his
body
assumed
his
eyes
were
full
and
prominent
but
the
whites
of
them
were
of
a
dull
yellowish
tint
which
with
their
restless
and
suspicious
expression
gave
them
a
disagreeable
look
and
one
which
bespoke
a
mind
of
perpetual
but
not
profound
thought
his
nose
was
small
and
straight
and
with
his
mouth
would
have
been
except
for
the
habitual
sneer
which
sat
on
both
his
eyebrows
and
mustachios
were
trimmed
most
carefully
into
arched
lines
and
he
wore
no
beard
in
his
hand
there
was
a
large
rosary
of
beautiful
pearls
with
emeralds
at
the
regular
distances
which
he
kept
perpetually
counting
mechanically
with
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
before
him
lay
a
straight
sword
of
small
size
the
hilt
of
which
was
inlaid
with
gold
and
turquoise
stones
and
near
him
stood
a
gold
inlaid
with
precious
stones
into
which
he
incessantly
discharged
the
saliva
engendered
by
the
quantity
of
pān
he
chewed
the
red
colour
of
which
appeared
upon
his
lips
and
teeth
in
a
disagreeable
manner
and
a
chased
gold
containing
some
reed
pens
ink
paper
and
a
pair
of
scissors
to
cut
it
to
the
sizes
required
lay
near
his
left
hand
the
ceremony
of
presentation
and
of
obeisance
went
on
rapidly
almost
all
offered
their
nuzzurs
of
gold
or
silver
which
the
sultaun
took
and
deposited
beside
him
until
there
had
accumulated
a
goodly
heap
kasim
at
the
distance
he
then
was
could
catch
nothing
of
the
conversation
which
was
going
on
for
in
spite
of
the
loud
cries
of
khamosh
khamosh
from
the
attendants
there
was
more
noise
in
the
assembly
than
he
thought
befitting
the
presence
of
the
sultaun
after
waiting
some
little
time
and
having
advanced
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
musnud
the
sultaun
s
eye
fell
upon
the
khan
who
in
truth
was
a
remarkable
figure
even
among
that
assembly
being
the
only
one
who
wore
armour
as
the
sultaun
s
eye
met
his
the
khan
advanced
and
bidding
kasim
remain
where
he
was
till
he
should
be
called
he
performed
his
obeisance
presenting
with
the
handle
of
his
sword
upon
an
embroidered
handkerchief
his
nuzzur
of
five
gold
mohurs
which
the
sultaun
received
most
propitiously
we
welcome
thee
back
khan
sahib
most
heartily
said
the
sultaun
and
it
is
pleasant
in
our
eyes
to
see
an
old
friend
return
in
health
but
thou
art
thin
friend
the
effects
of
the
journey
perhaps
praise
be
to
alla
his
servant
unworthy
of
the
honour
hath
been
given
power
of
dreams
such
as
no
one
else
hath
enjoyed
since
the
days
of
the
apostle
on
whose
memory
be
peace
we
dreamed
last
the
blessed
planets
were
in
a
most
auspicious
conjunction
as
we
learned
upon
inquiry
this
morning
as
soon
as
we
arose
which
assures
the
matter
to
we
should
see
the
face
of
an
old
friend
and
receive
a
new
servant
who
should
eclipse
all
the
young
men
of
our
court
in
gallant
bearing
bravery
and
as
he
looked
around
when
he
had
said
this
all
those
within
hearing
cried
ameen
ameen
who
is
favoured
of
alla
like
unto
the
sultaun
may
he
live
a
hundred
years
whose
knowledge
is
equal
to
his
not
that
even
of
aflatoon
or
ay
he
continued
behold
it
hath
come
true
here
has
the
khan
as
it
were
dropped
from
the
clouds
and
with
him
a
young
man
who
inshalla
is
one
whose
bravery
is
great
bring
him
forward
o
khan
that
our
fortunate
glance
may
rest
on
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
huzrut
said
the
khan
he
is
unworthy
the
honour
nevertheless
i
offer
him
unto
your
service
and
can
answer
that
he
hath
as
stout
an
arm
and
as
brave
a
heart
as
he
looks
to
have
mashalla
i
have
seen
both
tried
in
circumstances
of
great
peril
to
good
said
the
sultaun
before
whom
kasim
had
performed
the
tusleemât
or
three
obeisances
and
now
stood
with
folded
hands
good
by
the
prophet
a
fine
youth
there
is
truth
on
his
destiny
is
who
can
discern
character
like
the
sultaun
cried
several
behold
all
things
even
men
s
hearts
are
open
to
he
hath
lucky
marks
about
his
face

cried

tell
thee
of
thy

you
have
your

beg
to
represent
that
the
khan
escorted
some
kafir
prisoners
from
bangalore
said
an
officer
who
was
sitting
near
the
sultaun
would

highness

true
replied
the
sultaun
we
had
forgotten
that
and
he
added
as
the
expression
of
his
countenance
changed
command
silence
and
let
them
be
brought
into
the
chapter
xxii
there
hardly
needed
the
order
to
be
given
that
silence
should
be
observed
as
the
words
the
sultaun
spoke
fell
upon
the
ears
of
the
assembly
and
they
observed
the
sudden
change
in
his
countenance
the
busy
tongues
ceased
directly
there
continued
a
little
talking
and
some
bustle
towards
the
end
of
the
room
but
as
the
chobdars
called
silence
and
went
hither
and
thither
to
enforce
it
all
became
hushed
except
the
sultaun
himself
who
was
inquiring
from
the
secretaries
whether
any
despatches
had
accompanied
the
prisoners
from
bangalore
huzrut
said
the
khan
again
advancing
they
are
in
the
possession
of
your
slave
who
craves
pardon
that
in
the
confusion
of
presenting
his
nuzzur
he
forgot
to
deliver
and
he
laid
the
packets
at
the
sultaun
s
feet
who
instantly
tore
open
the
envelope
and
selecting
one
of
the
enclosures
directed
to
himself
fell
to
perusing
it
with
great
attention
this
speaks
well
of
the
prisoners
he
said
at
length
to
syud
ghuffoor
who
sat
near
him
the
killadar
of
bangalore
writes
that
one
of
them
a
captain
is
a
man
of
knowledge
well
versed
in
the
science
of
war
and
tactics
that
he
understands
fortification
and
gunnery
so
that
he
is
worthy
of
being
offered
our
clement
protection
inshalla
therefore
though
we
need
no
instruction
in
these
matters
be
to
alla
who
hath
implanted
a
natural
knowledge
of
them
in
our
heart
which
is
not
surpassed
by
any
of
the
whoreson
and
all
around
interrupting
him
cried
ameen
ameen
inshalla
he
continued
as
this
is
an
auspicious
day
we
will
offer
life
and
service
if
he
accept
it
well
if
not
i
will
send
him
to
hell
where
thousands
of
his
accursed
and
race
await
his
coming
are
not
these
good
words
words
they
are
not
worthy
to
live
the
race
is
accursed
of
alla
cried
several
the
sultaun
s
clemency
is
great
as
this
ceased
the
tramp
of
many
feet
was
heard
on
the
wooden
staircase
and
as
the
noise
approached
nearer
kasim
who
had
been
watching
the
sultaun
narrowly
with
intense
interest
could
see
that
he
was
far
from
being
at
ease
he
fidgeted
upon
his
musnud
the
rosary
passed
twice
as
fast
as
usual
through
his
fingers
his
eyes
winked
sharply
and
he
stroked
his
mustachios
from
time
to
time
either
with
exultation
or
inquietude
kasim
could
not
distinguish
which
at
length
the
prisoners
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
their
escort
appeared
to
wait
there
for
commands
bid
the
officer
advance
said
the
sultaun
the
rest
may
be
withdrawn
for
the
present
we
will
send
for
them
when
this
man
is
disposed
the
order
was
obeyed
and
all
were
withdrawn
but
one
who
being
desired
to
come
forward
through
the
lane
which
was
opened
for
him
to
the
foot
of
the
musnud
advanced
slowly
but
with
erect
and
manly
gait
and
proud
bearing
nigh
to
where
the
sultaun
sat
salaam
to
the
light
of
the
world
to
the
sun
of
islam
perform
thine
obeisance
here
and
prostrate
thyself
on
the
ground
said
a
chobdar
who
accompanied
the
prisoner
i
will
salute
him
as
i
would
salute
my
own
monarch
said
the
prisoner
in
a
voice
audible
to
all
and
in
good
hindostanee
but
spoken
with
rather
a
foreign
pronunciation
and
still
advancing
he
had
placed
one
foot
upon
the
white
cloth
which
has
been
already
mentioned
kafir
cried
the
chobdar
striking
him
son
of
perdition
keep
back
dare
not
to
advance
a
step
beyond
the
carpet
prostrate
thyself
to
the
sultaun
and
implore
his
the
englishman
turned
in
an
instant
at
the
blow
he
had
received
and
raised
his
arm
to
strike
again
the
sultaun
observed
the
action
and
spoke
hold
he
cried
do
not
strike
o
feringhee
and
do
some
of
ye
seize
that
officious
rascal
and
give
him
ten
blows
upon
his
back
with
a
the
fellow
was
seized
and
hustled
out
while
the
englishman
continued
standing
where
he
had
been
arrested
advance
cried
the
sultaun
some
of
those
near
tried
to
persuade
him
not
to
allow
the
englishman
to
approach
pah
he
exclaimed
i
have
caused
the
deaths
of
too
many
with
arms
in
their
hands
to
fear
this
unarmed
wretch
advance
then
that
we
may
speak
with
thee
conveniently
be
not
afraid
we
will
do
thee
no
i
fear
thee
not
o
sultaun
said
herbert
compton
for
so
in
very
truth
it
was
advancing
and
bowing
stiffly
yet
respectfully
i
fear
thee
not
what
canst
thou
do
to
me
that
i
should
fear
thee
i
could
order
thee
to
be
put
to
death
this
instant
said
the
sultaun
sharply
while
others
cried
out
fiercely
that
the
speech
was
insolent
and
reviled
him
herbert
looked
round
him
proudly
and
many
a
one
among
the
crowd
of
flatterers
quailed
as
his
clear
blue
eye
rested
on
them
i
am
not
insolent
he
exclaimed
if
my
speech
is
plain
and
honest
take
ye
a
lesson
from
it
cowards
who
could
insult
one
so
helpless
as
i
am
and
he
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
folded
his
arms
awaiting
what
the
sultaun
should
say
to
him
his
dress
was
mean
of
the
coarsest
white
cotton
cloth
of
the
country
his
head
was
bare
and
so
were
his
feet
but
in
spite
of
this
there
was
a
dignity
in
his
appearance
which
inspired
involuntary
respect
nay
awe
to
many
the
time
which
had
elapsed
had
but
little
altered
him
and
if
indeed
there
was
a
change
it
was
for
the
better
his
appearance
was
more
manly
his
frame
more
strongly
knit
his
face
was
thinner
and
paler
than
when
we
last
parted
with
him
at
the
capitulation
of
bednore
from
whence
with
the
rest
of
his
comrades
he
had
been
hurried
into
captivity
but
four
years
had
passed
since
then
and
his
weary
imprisonment
chequered
by
no
event
save
the
death
or
murder
of
a
companion
or
a
would
have
utterly
worn
down
a
spirit
less
buoyant
and
intrepid
than
herbert
s
mathews
had
perished
by
poison
almost
before
his
eyes
he
had
been
accused
of
having
buried
treasure
and
persisting
in
the
denial
of
this
he
had
been
tortured
by
confinement
in
irons
denied
food
subjected
to
privations
of
all
kinds
which
failing
in
their
effect
to
force
a
confession
of
what
had
not
taken
place
he
had
been
poisoned
by
the
sultaun
s
order
numbers
had
been
destroyed
numbers
had
died
of
hopelessness
of
the
climate
of
disease
engendered
by
inaction
many
had
been
released
at
the
peace
of
but
still
herbert
and
a
few
of
his
comrades
and
remained
and
had
lingered
on
their
wretched
existence
in
the
various
prisons
and
forts
of
the
country
for
tippoo
hoped
that
long
captivity
and
hardships
at
one
time
and
again
indulgence
and
relaxation
would
induce
them
to
accede
to
his
terms
of
service
which
were
offered
from
time
to
time
with
alternate
threats
of
death
and
promises
of
immense
rewards
herbert
s
situation
near
the
person
of
the
general
and
the
plans
of
fortifications
books
on
the
same
works
on
mathematics
on
engineering
and
his
many
drawings
all
of
which
had
been
seized
with
him
had
early
marked
him
as
an
officer
of
superior
attainment
and
one
whose
services
would
be
highly
valuable
the
others
who
were
confined
with
him
were
for
the
most
part
men
of
the
artillery
of
whose
experience
and
excellent
skill
as
marksmen
tippoo
had
too
often
seen
the
fatal
results
to
his
own
army
not
to
be
very
anxious
to
get
them
to
join
him
a
few
of
the
captives
from
time
to
time
dazzled
by
promises
which
were
never
fulfilled
and
weary
of
imprisonment
had
voluntarily
become
renegades
and
others
had
been
violently
converted
to
mahomedanism
these
served
in
the
army
and
though
dissolute
in
their
habits
were
yet
useful
and
brave
when
occasion
needed
and
the
value
of
their
services
only
made
tippoo
more
anxious
to
secure
those
of
a
higher
grade
and
more
extensive
acquirements
and
education
with
herbert
and
those
who
accompanied
him
his
many
attempts
had
been
vain
and
while
his
desire
to
accomplish
his
ends
became
the
more
violent
from
their
continued
opposition
there
now
existed
a
necessity
for
urging
their
compliance
which
will
presently
be
made
manifest
but
we
have
digressed
peace
cried
the
sultaun
we
have
not
sent
for
thee
o
feringhee
to
hear
thy
bold
speech
but
to
advise
thee
as
one
who
is
a
friend
to
thee
and
has
a
true
interest
in
thy
dost
thou
understand
the
condescending
speech
of
the
sultaun
or
shall
one
of
the
franceese
interpret
it
for
thee
asked
one
of
the
moonshees
officiously
peace
again
cried
the
sultaun
he
understands
me
well
enough
if
he
does
not
he
will
say
so
and
now
captain
compton
since
thus
it
is
written
is
thy
name
we
have
sent
for
thee
from
the
fort
not
as
a
common
criminal
and
one
whose
end
is
perdition
but
with
honour
we
had
thee
seated
on
an
elephant
lodged
in
a
good
tent
supplied
with
excellent
food
and
now
thou
art
admitted
into
the
presence
thou
shouldest
bow
in
acknowledgment
of
the
condescension
shown
thee
nay
thou
wouldst
have
done
so
we
are
persuaded
but
thy
manners
are
not
formed
upon
the
model
of
those
of
the
true
believers
now
our
good
friend
the
killadar
writes
to
us
that
weary
of
confinement
and
induced
by
a
sense
of
the
obligations
thou
and
thy
companions
are
under
to
me
thou
art
in
a
frame
of
mind
to
accept
our
munificent
offers
of
entertaining
thee
in
our
service
of
raising
thee
to
rank
of
admitting
thee
to
stop
cried
herbert
suddenly
while
as
he
spoke
the
sultaun
fairly
started
at
the
suddenness
of
the
interruption
to
his
harangue
and
the
boldness
of
the
tone
stop
when
we
are
on
equal
terms
thou
canst
offer
me
service
it
is
a
mockery
to
tempt
me
with
promises
thou
wouldst
not
by
the
gracious
alla
and
his
prophet
i
would
cried
the
sultaun
eagerly
say
then
wilt
thou
serve
me
thou
shalt
have
rank
power
wealth
i
am
in
your
hands
a
helpless
captive
o
sultaun
replied
herbert
and
therefore
i
can
not
but
hear
whatever
thou
choosest
to
say
to
me
but
if
thou
art
a
man
and
a
soldier
insult
me
no
more
with
such
words
nay
be
not
impatient
but
listen
when
mathews
was
poisoned
by
thy
order
start
not
thou
knowest
well
it
is
the
truth
was
given
the
choice
of
life
and
thy
service
or
death
upon
refusal
chose
death
year
after
year
i
have
seen
those
die
around
me
whom
i
loved
i
have
courted
death
by
refusal
of
thy
base
and
dishonourable
offers
thou
hast
not
dared
to
destroy
me
my
life
a
miserable
one
to
me
is
now
of
no
value
those
whom
i
love
in
my
own
land
have
long
mourned
me
as
dead
it
is
well
that
it
is
am
honoured
in
death
alive
and
in
thy
service
i
should
be
dead
to
them
but
dishonoured
therefore
i
prefer
death
i
ask
it
from
thee
as
a
favour
i
have
no
wish
to
live
bid
yonder
fellow
strike
my
head
from
my
body
before
thine
eyes
as
thou
lovest
to
look
on
blood
thou
wilt
see
how
a
man
and
an
englishman
can
bear
death
strike
i
defy
beat
him
on
the
mouth
with
a
shoe

the
kafir
son
of
perdition
send
him
to
hell
roared
many
voices
let
him
die
while
scowling
looks
and
threatening
gestures
met
him
on
all
sides
peace
exclaimed
the
sultaun
who
seeing
that
his
words
were
not
heard
amidst
the
hubbub
rose
from
his
seat
and
commanded
silence
peace
by
alla
i
swear
he
cried
when
the
assembly
was
still
once
more
if
any
one
disturbs
this
conference
by
word
or
deed
i
will
disgrace
and
then
turning
to
herbert
who
with
glowing
cheek
and
glistening
eye
stood
awaiting
what
he
thought
would
be
his
doom
fool
o
fool
he
cried

mad

thou
be
a
fool

race

as
dead

a
new
life

wilt
thou
not
listen
to
reason

thou
refuse
the
golden
path
which
thine
own
destiny
has
opened
to
thee

me
not

be
lodged
well
fed
from
my
own
table
in
three
days
i
will
again
hear
thy
were
it
three
years
my
answer
would
be
the
same
cried
herbert
whose
chest
heaved
with
excitement
and
who
with
some
difficulty
had
heard
out
the
sultaun
s
address
i
defy
thee
i
spurn
thy
base
and
dishonourable
offers
with
indignation
which
i
have
not
words
to
express
when
thou
canst
give
me
back
the
murdered
mathews
whose
blood
is
on
thy
thou
canst
restore
to
life
those
whom
thou
hast
murdered
thrown
from
rocks
thou
canst
do
this
i
will
serve
thee
for
the
rest
i
abhor
thy
base
and
unholy
hog
son
of
a
defiled
mother
vilest
son
of
hell
screamed
the
sultaun
almost
speechless
with
passion
dost
thou
dare
to
revile
the
faith
do
ye
hear
him
friends
do
ye
hear
the
kafir
s
words
have
ye
ears
and
do
not
avenge
me
have
ye
swords
and
do
not
use
them
fifty
swords
flashed
from
their
scabbards
as
he
spoke
and
many
were
uplifted
to
strike
the
daring
and
reckless
speaker
when
kasim
who
had
been
listening
with
the
most
intense
interest
and
remembering
his
promise
of
succour
while
he
felt
the
high
sense
of
honour
which
prompted
the
englishman
s
defiance
of
the
sultaun
rushed
forward
and
with
uplifted
arm
stayed
the
descent
of
the
weapons
which
would
have
deluged
the
floor
with
blood
and
committed
murder
on
an
innocent
person
hold
he
exclaimed
with
the
utmost
power
of
his
strong
voice
are
ye
men
are
ye
soldiers
to
cut
down
a
man
unarmed
and
who
is
helpless
as
a
woman
have
you
no
regard
for
honour
or
for
truth
when
you
hear
it
spoken
rash
and
foolish
youth
cried
the
sultaun
is
this
thy
first
act
of
service
an
act
of
disrespect
and
rebellion
and
yet
i
thank

thou

thee
for

thee
for
his

thy
death

continued
to
herbert
under
the
swords
of
the
moslims
would
have
been
sweet
and
that
of
a
shall
now
be
a
bitter
one
away
with
him
to

no
matter
how
he
is
carried
thither
the

the
meanest

is
enough
here
do
thou

see
this
done

and
day
till
it
is
accomplished
see
him
and
his
vile
companions
or
such
of
them
as
will
now
dare
to
refuse
my
offers
flung
from
the
rock
by
kowul
droog
and
hasten
back
to
report
that
they
are
dead
begone
farewell
brave
friend
said
herbert
to
kasim
as
they
laid
hold
on
him
roughly
and
with
violent
abuse
urged
his
departure
if
we
meet
not
again
on
earth
there
is
a
higher
and
a
better
world
where
men
of
all
creeds
will
meet
but
where
yonder
tiger
will
never
come
farewell
say
have
i
not
acquitted
myself
of
my
promise
to
thee
cried
kasim
passionately
for
he
too
was
held
by
the
khan
and
others
thou
hast
was
the
reply
may
god
reward
thy
his
last
words
were
lost
in
the
exclamations
threats
and
obscene
abuse
of
those
who
dragged
him
away
the
sultaun
himself
on
the
musnud
and
the
tumultuous
heaving
of
the
assembly
was
after
a
short
while
once
more
stilled
no
one
spoke
no
one
dared
to
interrupt
the
current
of
the
monarch
s
thoughts
whatever
they
might
be
all
had
their
eyes
fixed
upon
kasim
who
held
by
the
khan
and
another
waited
expecting
his
doom
in
silence
but
not
with
dread
yet
his
thoughts
were
in
a
whirl
of
excitement
and
the
remembrance
of
his
mother
ameena
the
englishman
and
the
acts
of
his
own
life
flashed
through
his
mind
till
he
could
hardly
distinguish
one
from
the
other
but
kasim
s
earnest
gaze
was
all
the
while
fixed
upon
the
monarch
who
for
a
few
moments
was
absorbed
in
a
reverie
in
which
indecision
and
a
feeling
of
mercy
toward
the
young
englishman
appeared
to
be
struggling
with
the
fiercely
excited
passion
which
still
trembled
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
his
chin
in
convulsive
twitchings
after
a
little
time
it
passed
away
and
left
only
that
stern
expression
which
was
habitual
to
him
when
a
sneer
did
not
occupy
his
features
his
eyes
had
been
fixed
on
vacancy
but
on
a
sudden
he
raised
them
up
and
they
met
those
of
kasim
who
still
held
by
the
khan
stood
close
to
him
ai
kumbukht
he
exclaimed
o
unfortunate
what
hast
thou
done
by
alla
i
would
have
loved
thee
only
for
thy
rashness
knowest
thou
the
peril
of
coming
between
the
tiger
and
his
prey
knowest
thou
that
i
have
but
to
speak
and
ere
thou
couldst
say
thy
belief
thy
young
blood
would
moisten
the
grass
yonder
knowest
thou
this
and
yet
didst
thou
dare
to
brave
me
alla
kureem
what
dirt
has
not
been
ordained
for
me
to
eat
whose
unlucky
face
could
i
have
seen
this
morning
when
i
awoke
speak
slave
thou
art
not
a
spy
of
the
kafir
english
that
thou
wentest
beside
thyself
in
his
behalf
whom
we
have
doomed
to
death
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
o
sultaun
cried
kasim
joining
his
hands
and
addressing
tippoo
i
am
no
am
not
hast
the
power
to
strike
my
head
from
my
it
be
done
your
slave
is
ready
to
then
why
didst
thou
behave
thus
said
tippoo
the
englishman
was
was
was
my
i
rescued
him
from
insult
at
bangalore
replied
kasim
he
told
me
his
history
and
i
grieved
for
him
he
besought
me
not
to
enter
thy
service
o
sultaun
but
to
join
his
race
i
was
free
to
have
done
so
but
i
despised
them
and
longed
to
fight
against
them
under
the
banner
of
the
lion
of
islam
i
swore
to
befriend
him
however
if
ever
i
could
the
time
came
sooner
than
i
expected
and
in
an
unlooked
for
form
and
i
had
been
faithless
craven
and
vile
had
i
failed
him
when
he
could
not
strike
a
blow
in
his
own
defence
this
is
the
truth
o
sultaun
punish
me
if
thou
am
thy
unhappy
boy
said
the
khan
to
him
in
a
whisper
thou
hast
spoken
too
boldly
alla
help
thee
for
there
is
no
hope
for
thee
that
i
can
see
see
he
speaks
to
kasim
ali
said
the
sultaun
had
one
of
these
who
know
me
dared
to
do
what
thou
hast
done
i
would
have
destroyed
him
had
any
one
dared
to
have
spoken
as
boldly
as
thou
hast
done
i
would
have
disgraced
him
for
disrespect
thou
art
art
brave
thou
hast
truth
on
thy
forehead
and
in
thy
words
and
we
love
it
go
thou
art
pardoned
and
yet
for
warning
s
sake
thou
must
suffer
punishment
lest
the
example
should
spread
in
our
army
to
alla
who
hath
given
his
servant
the
wisdom
to
direct
and
discipline
it
after
a
fashion
the
perfection
of
which
is
not
to
be
met
with
upon
the
here
he
paused
and
looked
around
and
all
the
courtiers
cried
ameen
ameen
listen
to
the
words
of
wisdom
to
the
oracle
of
the
faith
of
islam
for
example
s
sake
continued
the
sultaun
gravely
thou
must
be
punished
we
had
thy
pay
written
down
at
twelve
shall
be
ten
thou
wast
to
be
near
my
shalt
serve
under
the
khan
as
he
may
think
fit
if
thou
art
valiant
we
shall
hear
of
thee
with
pleasure
and
reward
thee
and
remember
our
eyes
which
are
as
as
those
of
alla
and
the
angels
will
ever
be
fixed
upon
thee
remember
this
and
tremble
while
thou
thinkest
upon
it
kasim
saluted
the
monarch
profoundly
and
drew
back
he
had
been
rebuked
but
mildly
and
the
honest
face
of
the
khan
was
once
more
overjoyed
inshalla
thy
destiny
is
great
he
whispered
now
had
i
or
any
one
else
here
got
by
any
accident
into
such
a
scrape
we
should
have
been
heavily
fined
degraded
and
alla
only
knows
what
else
but
thou
hast
come
off
triumphant
and
as
for
the
loss
of
the
money
thou
needest
not
mind
alla
grant
too
there
may
soon
be
an
opportunity
of
winning
fame
inshalla
we
will
yet
fight
just
then
the
loud
cries
of
khamoosh
khamoosh
again
resounded
through
the
hall
and
the
sultaun
once
more
spoke
let
every
officer
inspect
his
cushoon
minutely
during
the
ensuing
month
he
said
let
the
officers
of
cavalry
look
well
to
their
horses
let
those
who
have
the
charge
of
our
invincible
artillery
look
to
their
carriages
and
bullocks
let
all
the
departments
of
the
army
be
in
readiness
to
move
at
the
shortest
notice
for
we
hear
of
wars
against
our
detachments
in
canara
and
that
the
infidel
nairs
may
their
lot
be
perdition
have
again
taken
up
arms
and
are
giving
trouble
to
our
troops
therefore
it
was
revealed
to
us
in
a
dream
which
we
have
chronicled
as
it
appeared
and
with
which
we
will
now
delight
the
ears
of
our
and
feeling
under
him
for
a
manuscript
he
began
to
read
it
with
pompous
gravity
footnote
a
division
of
troops
on
the
night
before
last
soon
after
this
child
of
clay
lay
down
to
rest
an
angel
of
light
appeared
to
him
even
like
unto
the
angel
gabriel
as
he
manifested
himself
unto
the
blessed
apostle
may
his
memory
be
honoured
and
of
whom
this
mortal
is
an
unworthy
imitator
and
the
angel
said
the
nairs
in
thy
dominions
are
becoming
troublesome
therefore
shalt
thou
destroy
them
utterly
their
abominations
and
the
loose
conduct
of
their
women
are
offences
against
the
most
high
therefore
they
shall
be
punished
shall
be
all
honoured
with
and
so
saying
the
angel
vanished
and
this
servant
awoke
and
recorded
the
dream
as
he
had
heard
ajaib
ajaib
karamut

the
sultaun
is
the

of

from
the

with
many
other
ejaculations
equally
devout
and
flattering

wonderful
wonderful
a
miracle
a
miracle
yes
my
friends
even
thus
doth
the
providence
of
alla
overshadow
us
continued
the
sultaun
and
enable
us
to
avert
the
evils
which
the
infidels
would
bring
upon
the
true
faith
inshalla
however
we
will
teach
them
a
lesson
and
one
which
they
will
remember
while
they
have
being
i
have
read
you
my
dream
and
behold
in
confirmation
of
it
this
morning
s
post
brought
letters
from
arshed
beg
khan
our
governor
which
informs
us
of
the
disorders
and
that
he
is
making
head
against
them
with
all
the
force
he
can
muster
therefore
we
would
have
you
all
prepared
should
reinforcements
be
needed
and
now
rhyman
khan
he
added
what
news
hast
thou
for
us
from
the
court
of
nizam
ali
khan
shall
i
speak
it
out
protector
of
the
universe
or
wilt
thou
hear
it
in
thy
closet
said
the
khan
advancing
here
friend
here
what
secrets
have
i
that
my
friends
about
me
should
not
know
mashalla
in
the
sircar
khodadad
all
is
as
open
as
amidst
the
murmur
of
applause
which
this
speech
produced
the
khan
hemmed
audibly
to
ensure
silence
and
proceeded
i
beg
to
represent
said
he
that
nizam
ali
khan
is
favourable
to
the
favourable
the
english
pressed
him
to
give
up
the
province
of
guntoor
which
he
is
bound
to
do
by
treaty
but
he
is
unwilling
and
no
wonder
to
comply
things
have
advanced
to
almost
a
quarrel
between
them
and
if
he
was
sure
of
the
feeling
of
this
sircar
i
would
pledge
my
life
on
it
that
he
would
declare
war
and
thus
the
two
sircars
could
fight
under
the
banner
of
islam
and
exterminate
the
unbelievers
but
inshalla
there
will
be
more
proof
than
my
poor
words
for
i
heard
from
good
authority
that
the
huzoor
was
about
to
select
an
ambassador
a
man
of
tact
and
knowledge
who
will
explain
all
his
wishes
satisfactorily
an
ambassador
sayest
thou
khan
by
alla
rare
news
he
is
then
in
earnest
and
with
his
aid
what
may
not
be
done
he
can
bring
a
lakh
of
the
field
and
he
has
infantry
besides
alla
grant
he
may
come
soon
let
us
only
chastise
these
infidel
nairs
and
thus
make
a
step
towards
the
extermination
of
unbelief
from
hind
let
the
durbar
be
closed
he
cried
suddenly
and
abruptly
after
a
short
silence
and
rising
he
retired
into
one
of
the
smaller
rooms
where
alone
he
meditated
over
those
wild
schemes
of
conquest
which
were
eventually
his
ruin
chapter
xxiii
dragged
away
by
his
relentless
guards
herbert
compton
had
no
leisure
allowed
him
to
speak
with
his
companions
even
the
last
miserable
gratification
of
a
hurried
farewell
was
denied
him
and
as
he
passed
them
a
melancholy
group
some
standing
or
leaning
against
the
building
others
sitting
upon
the
grass
in
dejected
attitudes
he
strove
to
speak
but
every
word
was
a
signal
for
fresh
insult
and
he
was
pushed
struck
with
shoes
spit
upon
by
the
rabble
of
the
courtiers
servants
and
grooms
to
whom
the
sufferings
of
a
kafir
feringhee
were
the
highest
sport
that
could
be
afforded
a
sad
spectacle
was
herbert
s
renewed
captivity
in
insult
and
suffering
to
those
of
his
who
beheld
it

had
seen
him
and
several
others
of
their
body
brought
from
bangalore
in
decency
if
not
with
honour
during
their
journey
the
utmost
indulgence
had
been
shown
them
and
all
their
hearts
had
been
buoyant
with
excitement
when
herbert
alone
had
been
sent
for
into
the
durbar
for
they
were
well
assured
that
upon
his
fate
would
turn
the
issue
of
their
life
or
death
continued
captivity
or
release
there
had
been
many
among
them
who
had
in
the
buoyancy
of
hope
anticipated
a
release
before
whose
minds
visions
of
home
of
return
to
those
beloved
to
those
who
had
mourned
them
dead
had
been
rapidly
and
vividly
passing
who
when
a
ray
of
hope
had
darted
in
upon
their
cheerless
thoughts
had
allowed
it
to
illuminate
and
warm
them
till
it
had
induced
even
extravagances
of
behaviour
some
had
exulted
to
their
more
staid
companions
others
had
sung
or
whistled
joyfully
and
the
mockery
of
their
guards
and
of
the
bystanders
only
served
to
excite
them
the
more
and
to
cause
them
to
anticipate
their
triumph
by
words
and
gestures
not
to
be
misunderstood
by
those
to
whom
they
were
addressed
but
when
herbert
passed
out
ruffled

away
without
being
allowed
to
exchange

to

and
followed
by
the
jeers
and
scoffings
of
the
crowd

thirsted

hope

them
and
the
memory
of
the
deaths
of
former
companions
by
poison
by
torture
or
by
the
executioner
came
upon
them
suddenly
and
caused
a

deadly

glances
and
a

with

had
fled

were
in
bodies
of
three
and
four
led
before
the
sultaun
in
the
evening
durbar
and
like
herbert
offered
the
alternative
of
death
or
service
and
life
a
few
were
found
to
prefer
the
latter
but
by
far
the
greater
part
braved
the
tyrant
s
wrath
and
in
despair
chose
to
die
that
evening
saw
the
return
of
a
melancholy
band
to
the
fort
of
nundidroog
the
rigours
of
the
captivity
of
which
had
been
known
to
them
before
by
report
as
also
the
fate
there
of
many
a
brave
fellow
european
and
native
boasted
to
them
by
their
guards
in
the
various
forts
and
prisons
in
which
they
had
been
confined
nor
was
it
as
if
they
had
been
led
to
death
at
once
those
who
could
speak
a
few
words
of
the
language
of
the
country
had
implored
this
of
the
sultaun
but
had
been
refused
with
exultation
and
they
had
to
endure
a
long
march
of
many
days
with
every
hardship
and
indignity
which
the
unconcealed
wrath
and
spite
of
the
sultaun
descending
almost
in
a
redoubled
degree
to
his
subordinate
officers
could
inflict
upon
them
their
food
was
of
the
coarsest
description
bad
water
where
it
could
be
found
was
given
them
to
drink
miserable
doolies
in
which
it
was
impossible
to
lie
at
full
length
or
even
to
sit
and
open
so
that
the
sun
beat
in
on
them
were
given
to
some
they
were
carried
too
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
villages
who
were
pressed
from
stage
to
stage
in
order
that
they
might
travel
with
the
utmost
expedition
and
as
these
men
were
unaccustomed
to
carry
loads
in
that
way
the
exhausted
men
they
bore
were
jolted
until
excess
of
fatigue
often
caused
faintness
and
even
death
blest
were
those
who
died
thus
they
were
spared
the
misery
the
survivors
had
to
endure
nor
was
the
person
under
whose
charge
they
travelled
jaffar
sahib

likely
to
make
any
amelioration
in
their
condition
he
had
received
his
last
orders
from
tippoo
at
the
evening
durbar
relative
to
herbert
compton
in
regard
to
whom
his
instructions
were
somewhat
different
to
those
the
sultaun
had
given
in
the
morning
and
also
to
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
and
well
mounted
himself
and
accompanied
by
an
escort
of
his
own
risala
the
jemadar
hurried
on
travelling
the
whole
day
with
but
short
rests
when
the
exhaustion
of
some
of
the
prisoners
or
at
times
the
want
of
a
relay
of
bearers
caused
an
unavoidable
stoppage
everywhere
it
was
made
known
that
the
feringhees
were
going
to
death
and
while
crowds
from
many
of
the
villages
and
towns
flocked
to
see
them
as
they
passed
by
they
were
everywhere
met
by
bitter
insults
abuse
and
derision
it
was
a
bitter
cup
to
quaff
for
herbert
compton
who
in
spite
of
all
was
not
cast
down
his
stout
heart
on
the
contrary
prepared
for
death
by
long
suffering
and
abandonment
of
all
hope
looked
to
the
termination
of
his
journey
with
joyful
feelings
as
the
time
when
he
should
be
released
from
his
earthly
troubles
indeed
since
the
capitulation
of
bednore
after
they
were
all
led
away
into
captivity
frequent
disappearance
of
his
comrades
and
brother
officers
telling
their
untimely
fates
had
daily
prepared
himself
for
death
not
knowing
in
what
hour
or
by
what
manner
he
should
be
summoned
to
it
this
had
lasted
so
long
that
the
dim
visions
of
hope
which
had
now
and
then
broken
the
gloom
in
which
his
future
was
wrapped
so
far
as
life
was
concerned
were
at
an
end
now
a
hope
of
death
succeeded
which
amounted
to
a
certainty
and
was
even
pleasant
in
contemplation
at
first
how
bitter
how
agonising
had
been
his
thoughts
of
home
of
his
of
all
of
amy
whom
he
could
not
help
picturing
to
himself
as
worn
down
by
sorrow
broken
in
spirit
and
mourning
his
absence
most
likely
his
death
in
vain
his
mother
too
alas
what
a
world
of
thought
was
there
not
in
her
name
who
had
so
loved
him
and
whose
tender
nature
could
ill
have
borne
so
rude
a
shock
as
that
of
his
death
for
he
was
sure
they
must
long
ago
have
abandoned
all
hope
of
his
being
alive
and
when
at
the
peace
some
captives
were
given
up
and
it
was
told
that
the
others
were
dead
though
it
was
well
known
in
india
that
there
were
many
retained
yet
they
would
be
ignorant
of
this
in
england
and
would
conclude
he
was
dead
also
thus
he
looked
to
the
future
with
a
hope
a
certainty
of
reunion
in
death
with
those
he
had
best
loved
on
earth
and
this
made
him
cheerful
and
calm
when
many
around
him
either
held
the
stern
silence
of
despair
or
mournfully
bewailed
their
fate
as
they
passed
bangalore
the
governor
visited
them
by
order
of
the
sultaun
he
had
known
herbert
and
supplied
him
with
hindostanee
books
which
was
done
by
tippoo
s
order
that
he
might
in
the
solitude
and
of
learn
the
language
of
the
country
which
would
fit
him
for
the
duties
for
which
he
designed
him
he
was
grieved
to
see
him
and
advised
him
to
comply
with
the
sultaun
s
request
which
tippoo
knowing
that
he
had
been
kind
to
the
young
englishman
and
thinking
he
might
be
able
to
turn
him
aside
from
his
purpose
had
advanced
to
him
the
brave
soldier
who
not
long
afterwards
met
a
warrior
s
death
in
defence
of
the
fortress
used
his
utmost
persuasion
to
alter
herbert
s
resolution
but
in
vain
was
deeply
rooted
the
alternative
proposed
was
too
dishonourable
in
prospect
and
the
event
so
nigh
at
hand
too
welcome
for
his
resolution
to
be
shaken
he
bade
herbert
farewell
with
an
expression
of
deep
feeling
and
interest
which
gratified
him
and
which
his
friend
did
not
seek
to
disguise
with
one
or
two
of
the
captives
however
the
governor
was
more
successful
the
near
approach
of
death
and
the
inability
to
look
on
it
continuously
for
many
days
was
more
than
they
could
bear
and
they
yielded
to
solicitation
which
they
little
hoped
would
have
been
used
there
were
still
a
few
however
whom
the
example
of
herbert
and
their
own
strong
and
faithful
hearts
kept
steady
to
their
purpose
men
who
preferred
death
to
dishonour
in
the
service
of
their
country
s
foe
the
killadar
caused
nearly
two
days
to
be
spent
in
the
negotiations
with
the
prisoners
in
despite
of
the
inquiry
of
jaffar
sahib
who
pretended
to
be
full
of
zeal
in
the
execution
of
the
sultaun
s
orders
but
on
the
third
morning
after
their
arrival
there
was
no
longer
pretence
for
delay
and
the
party
again
set
forward
the
day
after
herbert
knew
they
should
arrive
at
the
fort
of
nundidroog
and
their
place
of
execution
was
then
but
at
a
short
distance
another
day
thought
he
and
all
will
be
over
already
the
dark
grey
mass
of
the
fort
appeared
above
the
plain
as
they
approached
it
its
immense
height
and
precipitous
sides
rose
plainly
into
view
that
evening
they
passed
over
the
large
tank
to
the
southward
of
the
fort
on
the
bangalore
road
and
as
its
huge
bulk
appeared
to
sleep
peacefully
reflected
on
the
waters
making
its
perpendicular
sides
and
immense
height
the
more
apparent
herbert
thought
the
death
to
which
he
was
doomed
would
be
easy
and
sudden
and
that
it
was
a
more
merciful
one
than
that
of
mathews
or
the
lingering
torment
or
strangulation
of
so
many
others
herbert
observed
during
the
journey
that
the
officer
who
commanded
the
large
party
which
escorted
them
kept
aloof
from
him
in
particular
he
had
seen
him
address
the
others
and
heard
from
them
that
he
endeavoured
to
reason
them
into
acceptance
of
the
sultaun
s
offers
to
himself
he
had
never
spoken
but
concealed
his
face
from
him
he
had
however
seen
it
several
times
and
on
each
occasion
was
inclined
to
think
that
it
was
familiar
to
him
but
on
reflection
he
could
discover
no
clue
to
the
supposition
in
his
mind
and
he
vainly
strove
to
dismiss
the
idea
from
his
thoughts
the
town
of
nundidroog
was
in
sight
it
was
evening
the
mountain
flung
its
broad
shadow
over
the
plain
under
the
declining
rays
of
the
sun
and
the
warm
red
light
of
an
indian
sunset
covered
every
object
with
splendour
the
herds
of
cattle
and
of
sheep
and
goats
were
hastening
home
from
their
pasture
with
loud
lowings
and
bleatings
and
the
simple
melody
of
the
shepherd
s
pipe
arose
now
far
away
now
near
from
the
various
herds
they
passed
on
their
left
towered
the
huge
rock
almost
above
their
heads
its
fortifications
built
on
the
giddy
verge
full
eight
hundred
feet
above
the
brushwood
and
rocky
declivity
out
of
which
it
rose
naked
appeared
ready
to
topple
over
the
precipice
there
was
one
huge
round
bastion
in
particular
on
the
very
edge
of
the
steepest
and
highest
part
and
herbert
speculated
whether
or
no
that
was
the
spot
he
was
looking
so
intently
at
it
that
he
did
not
heed
the
approach
on
his
right
hand
of
the
leader
of
the
party
who
speaking
to
him
suddenly
almost
startled
him
by
the
familiar
accent
of
his
voice
dost
thou
see
yonder
bastion
feringhee
said
the
officer
pointing
to
yonder
round
one
from
which
the
flag
of
the
sultaun
floats
proudly
upon
the
evening
wind
i
do
replied
herbert
it
is
a
giddy
many
a
kafir
feringhee
continued
the
man
has
been
flung
from
thence
while
a
prayer
for
mercy
was
on
his
lips
and
his
last
shrieks
grew
fainter
and
fainter
as
he
descended
to
perdition
many
an
unworthy
moslim
and
kafir
hindoo
taken
in
arms
against
the
true
believers
have
wished
they
had
never
been
born
or
had
never
seen
your
accursed
race
when
he
was
taken
to
the
edge
and
hurled
over
death
will
be
easy
from
thence
said
herbert
calmly
i
can
look
on
it
and
think
on
it
with
pleasure
is
that
the
place
no
cried
the
man
exultingly
interrupting
him
that
is
too
good
for
thee
and
thy
obstinate
companions
dost
thou
see
yonder
hill
and
he
pointed
to
one
around
which
the
evening
vapour
was
wreathing
itself
in
soft
fleecy
masses
while
the
red
sunlight
lighted
up
its
rugged
sides
and
narrow
top
i
see
it
said
herbert
beneath
it
continued
the
man
there
is
a
rock
thou
wilt
see
it
then
stay
cried
herbert
tell
me
if
thou
it
matters
little
to
one
so
near
me
who
thou
art
surely
i
have
met
thee
ere
now
thy
voice
is
familiar
to
my
thou
shalt
know
was
the
only
reply
the
man
gave
as
he
touched
the
flanks
of
his
horse
and
galloped
to
the
head
of
the
detachment
the
wearied
prisoners
were
glad
when
they
reached
the
ancient
hindoo
cloisters
where
we
have
before
seen
the
khan
and
ameena
with
his
risala
encamped
and
though
the
evening
wind
which
had
arisen
sharply
blew
chill
around
them
and
whistled
through
the
ruined
arches
and
pillars
they
were
glad
to
eat
their
humble
meal
of
coarse
flour
cakes
and
a
little
sour
curds
and
wrapping
themselves
in
the
which
were
flung
to
them
out
of
pity
by
the
grooms
they
lay
down
on
the
hard
ground
each
with
a
stone
for
his
pillow
and
exhausted
nature
claiming
its
repose
they
slept
soundly
but
herbert
only
for
a
while
he
had
dreamed
vividly
and
yet
confusedly
of
many
things
and
at
last
awoke
fevered
and
unrefreshed
a
jar
of
water
was
beside
them
he
arose
drank
some
which
revived
him
and
sat
down
on
a
broken
pillar
for
he
could
not
sleep
again
thought
was
too
busy
within
him
there
was
no
one
stirring
except
the
men
on
watch
who
lazily
paced
to
and
fro
close
to
him
talking
in
short
sentences
he
strove
to
listen
to
their
conversation
and
do
you
think
he
knows
where
it
is
they
say
the
feringhees
buried
it
when
the
place
was
taken
said
one
willa
alum
said
the
other
the
jemadar
says
he
does
and
that
he
will
make
him
tell
where
it
is
footnote
god
knows
here
herbert
lost
the
rest
and
they
did
not
return
to
the
subject
again
but
wandered
away
to
others
which
to
him
had
no
interest
the
night
was
very
chill
and
a
keen
wind
blew
raising
the
fine
dust
which
had
accumulated
in
the
place
and
blowing
it
sharply
against
his
face
there
was
something
melancholy
in
the
sound
as
it
whistled
and
moaned
through
the
ruins
and
through
the
branches
of
an
old
blasted
which
blanched
with
age
stood
out
a
ghastly
object
against
the
dark
sky
at
length
after
some
time
of
weary
watching
a
cock
in
the
town
crew
another
answered
his
call
and
as
herbert
looked
into
the
east
the
grey
flush
of
dawn
was
apparent
and
he
was
glad
the
day
had
come
though
it
was
to
be
as
he
thought
his
last
the
whole
party
were
soon
astir
the
unhappy
sleepers
aroused
and
as
one
by
one
they
awoke
to
consciousness
with
the
light
that
greeted
them
miserable
thoughts
of
death
poured
into
their
hearts
and
occupied
them
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
idea
one
sat
motionless
and
apparently
stupefied
as
though
he
had
eaten
opium
another
prayed
aloud
wildly
yet
fervently
others
laughed
and
spoke
with
a
feverish
excitement
and
there
were
one
or
two
who
blasphemed
and
cursed
while
they
bewailed
their
early
and
fearful
fate
for
some
hours
they
waited
in
the
cloisters
and
the
sun
was
high
and
bright
ere
a
body
of
men
on
foot
the
soldiers
of
the
country
armed
with
sword
and
matchlock
marched
into
it
it
was
plain
that
their
escort
was
to
be
changed
and
that
the
respectable
men
who
had
been
with
them
were
no
longer
to
accompany
them
but
had
given
place
to
some
of
the
lowest
description
of
tippoo
s
troops
who
were
usually
composed
of
the
unclean
castes
of
the
country
their
appearance
was
forbidding
and
in
vain
the
prisoners
looked
for
a
glance
of
pity
from
the
and
band
to
whom
they
were
given
over
they
appeared
used
to
the
scenes
which
were
to
ensue
and
regarded
the
miserable
englishmen
with
a
cold
stare
of
indifferent
curiosity
but
little
communication
passed
between
the
prisoners
herbert
had
for
some
days
spoken
to
them
and
advised
them
to
prepare
for
death
by
prayer
and
penitent
confession
to
god
he
had
reasoned
with
several
who
had
from
the
first
shown
a
foolhardy
and
light
demeanour
on
the
madness
of
attempting
indifference
to
their
fate
but
as
the
time
drew
near
he
was
too
fully
occupied
with
his
own
overpowering
thoughts
to
attend
to
the
others
and
he
had
withdrawn
to
as
far
a
distance
as
possible
from
them
where
he
sat
moodily
and
contemplated
with
bitter
thoughts
his
approaching
death
while
he
was
thus
occupied
the
jemadar
entered
the
court
and
having
given
some
orders
to
the
men
who
remained
behind
he
directed
the
legs
of
the
prisoners
to
be
tied
this
having
been
executed
they
were
placed
in
the
doolies
and
the
whole
again
proceeded
passing
the
outskirts
of
the
town
of
nundidroog
they
travelled
for
two
or
three
miles
through
the
avenues
of
which
in
parts
line
the
road
could
they
have
had
thought
for
anything
around
them
they
would
have
admired
the
varied
prospect
presented
to
them
by
the
rugged
rocky
hills
and
their
picturesque
and
outlines
but
one
idea
absorbed
all
others
and
they
were
borne
along
in
a
kind
of
unconscious
state
they
could
see
nothing
but
death
even
though
the
bright
sun
was
in
their
eyes
and
the
glad
and
joyful
face
of
nature
was
spread
out
before
them
at
length
the
leading
men
turned
off
the
road
by
a
towards
a
huge
pile
of
rocks
in
the
plain
about
half
a
mile
distant
and
the
others
followed
it
was
plain
to
all
that
this
was
their
destination
then
it
flashed
across
their
minds
that
the
rock
was
not
high
enough
to
cause
death
instantaneously
and
while
some
demanded
in
haughty
words
of
expostulation
to
be
taken
to
the
fort
itself
or
to
the
summit
of
the
conical
mountain
which
arose
precipitously
on
the
right
hand
besought
the
same
with
piteous
and
plaintive
entreaty
in
very
abjectness
compared
with
their
former
conduct
they
might
as
well
have
spoken
to
the
wind
which
blew
over
them
in
soft
and
cool
breezes
as
if
to
soothe
their
excited
and
fevered
frames
ignorant
of
the
only
language
of
which
the
europeans
could
speak
a
few
words
the
rude
soldiers
listened
with
indifference
or
replied
with
obscene
jests
and
mocking
gestures
and
tones
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
rocks
the
bearers
were
directed
to
put
down
the
doolies
and
the
prisoners
were
dragged
from
them
with
violence
a
few
clung
with
fearful
cries
to
the
wretched
vehicle
which
had
been
their
wearisome
abode
for
so
many
days
and
one
or
two
resisted
with
frantic
efforts
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
the
endeavours
of
their
guards
to
lead
them
up
the
narrow
pathway
they
were
even
wounded
in
their
struggles
but
the
men
they
had
to
deal
with
were
far
stronger
than
the
attenuated
europeans
and
had
been
accustomed
to
the
work
too
long
to
heed
cries
or
screams
they
were
the
guard
of
the
rock
even
now
remembered
who
had
been
selected
for
their
fierce
behaviour
strength
and
savage
deportment
to
carry
into
execution
the
decrees
of
the
sultaun
all
the
while
they
had
been
accompanied
by
the
jemadar
who
having
ridden
in
advance
of
the
party
now
awaited
their
coming
at
the
top
of
the
rock
herbert
was
the
first
who
arrived
there
led
by
the
rope
which
tied
to
both
his
arms
was
held
by
one
of
the
guards
while
others
with
drawn
swords
walked
on
each
side
of
and
behind
him
he
had
been
cast
down
in
heart
since
the
morning
and
faint
and
sick
at
heart
but
now
his
spirit
seemed
nerved
within
him
one
plunge
he
thought
and
all
would
be
over
then
he
should
be
released
from
this
worse
than
death
prayer
too
was
in
his
heart
and
on
his
lips
and
his
soul
was
comforted
as
he
stepped
firmly
upon
the
level
space
above
and
looked
around
him
the
jemadar
was
there
and
a
few
other
soldiers
the
terrace
was
a
naked
rock
which
was
heated
by
the
sun
so
that
it
scorched
his
bare
feet
there
were
a
few
bushes
growing
around
it
and
on
one
side
were
two
mud
houses
the
one
close
the
other
open
for
the
guard
besides
these
there
was
a
hut
of
reeds
which
was
used
as
a
place
for
keeping
water
thou
art
welcome
captain
said
the
jemadar
with
mock
politeness
art
thou
ready
to
taste
of
the
banquet
of
death
lead
on
said
herbert
firmly
and
molest
me
not
by
thy
words
i
am
not
so
fast
sir
the
sultaun
s
orders
must
first
be
obeyed
say
art
thou
ready
to
take
his
service
or
dost
thou
refuse
i
have
already
told
him
my
determination
and
will
waste
no
words
upon
such
as
thee
was
herbert
s
reply
it
is
well
said
the
jemadar
thou
wilt
learn
ere
long
to
speak
differently
and
he
turned
away
from
him
to
where
several
of
the
others
were
now
standing
he
regarded
them
for
a
few
minutes
steadily
and
exultingly
as
one
by
one
the
miserable
beings
were
led
up
and
some
unable
from
mental
and
bodily
exhaustion
to
support
themselves
sunk
down
on
the
rock
almost
there
was
one
youth
a
noble
and
vigorous
fellow
herbert
had
remembered
him
when
he
was
first
brought
to
bangalore
from
some
distant
and
full
of
fire
which
even
captivity
had
not
tamed
but
the
long
and
rapid
journey
the
bad
food
the
exposure
to
scorching
heat
and
chilling
dew
had
brought
on
dysentery
which
had
exhausted
him
nigh
to
death
he
was
almost
carried
by
the
guards
and
set
down
apart
from
the
rest
his
languid
and
sunken
eye
and
pallid
cheek
told
of
his
sickness
but
there
was
a
look
of
hope
in
the
glance
which
he
cast
upwards
now
and
then
and
a
gentle
movement
of
his
lips
which
showed
that
his
spirit
was
occupied
in
prayer
the
jemadar
s
eye
rested
on
him
let
him
be
the
will
die
else
he
cried
to
some
of
the
guards
who
having
divested
themselves
of
their
arms
stood
ready
to
do
his
bidding
a
cry
of
horror
burst
from
the
group
of
englishmen
there
were
two
or
three
of
the
strong
men
who
struggled
firmly
with
their
captors
as
their
gallant
hearts
prompted
them
to
strike
a
blow
for
their
suffering
comrade
but
bound
and
guarded
what
could
they
do
they
saw
the
young
man
lifted
up
by
two
of
the
executioners
and
borne
rapidly
to
the
further
edge
of
the
rock
not
twenty
yards
from
them
he
uttered
no
cry
but
looking
towards
them
sadly
he
bade
them
farewell
for
ever
with
a
glance
even
more
eloquent
than
words
another
instant
and
he
was
hurled
from
the
brink
by
those
who
carried
him
almost
unconsciously
each
bent
forward
to
catch
even
a
passing
sound
should
any
arise
and
there
was
a
dead
silence
for
a
few
moments
as
the
men
who
had
done
their
work
leaned
over
the
edge
to
see
if
it
had
been
surely
effected
but
none
arose
the
sufferer
had
been
quickly
released
from
his
earthly
pain
dost
thou
see
that
captain
compton
said
the
jemadar
thy
turn
will
now
was
the
reply
i
am
ready
and
herbert
hoped
that
his
turn
would
be
the
next
his
energies
were
knit
and
his
spirit
prepared
for
the
change
not
yet
said
the
jemadar
i
would
speak
with
thee
first
lead
the
rest
away
into
the
house
yonder
he
continued
to
the
guard
loose
them
and
lock
the
it
was
done
and
herbert
alone
remained
outside
listen
he
said
addressing
herbert
does
thou
remember
me
i
said
before
that
i
thought
i
knew
thee
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
death
said
herbert
i
am
ready
to
die
bid
thy
people
do
their
that
will
not
be
for
many
days
he
replied
i
have
a
long
reckoning
to
settle
with
for
what
i
have
never
harmed
when
mathews
was
in
bednore
and
there
was
alarm
of
the
sultaun
s
coming
thou
didst
suspect
me
thou
and
another
thou
didst
insult
and
threaten
to
hang
me
we
are
even
now
thou
understand
what
jaffar
sahib
the
guide
the
man
who
betrayed
the
salt
he
ate
even
so
ye
were
owls
fools
and
fell
into
the
snare
laid
for
has
thy
resentment
slumbered
so
long
then
said
herbert
i
pity
thee
thy
own
heart
must
be
a
hell
to
kafir
dare
to
speak
so
again
and
i
will
spit
on
it
would
befit
thee
to
do
so
but
i
am
silent
was
herbert
s
reply
where
is
the
money
that
thou
and
that
old
fool
who
is
now
in
perdition
buried
in
bednore
lead
me
to
it
and
i
will
save
thy
life
the
coast
is
near
and
thou
canst
escape
fear
not
to
speak
around
do
not
understand
thy
master
has
been
told
by
me
by
mathews
who
lost
his
life
in
that
cause
and
by
every
one
that
there
was
none
but
what
he
found
we
hid
no
well
knowest
this
why
dost
thou
torment
me
thou
wilt
remember
it
in
three
or
four
days
perhaps
said
the
man
till
then
i
shall
not
ask
thee
again
go
to
the
company
of
thy
herbert
s
mind
had
been
strung
up
to
its
purpose
and
he
coveted
death
at
that
moment
as
the
dearest
boon
which
could
have
been
granted
but
it
was
denied
him
and
he
could
only
gather
from
the
leader
of
the
party
that
further
suffering
was
in
store
for
him
in
spite
of
his
utmost
exertions
to
repel
the
feeling
despondence
came
over
him
sickening
and
sinking
of
his
heart
which
his
utmost
exertion
of
mind
could
not
repel
the
day
passed
away
and
the
night
fell
as
the
gloom
spread
over
their
narrow
chamber
the
men
whom
the
light
had
kept
silent
or
cheering
each
other
now
gave
way
to
superstitious
terrors
and
as
they
huddled
together
in
a
group
some
cried
out
that
there
were
hideous
spectres
about
them
others
prayed
aloud
and
those
who
were
hard
of
heart
blasphemed
and
made
no
repentance
as
night
advanced
some
yelled
in
mental
agony
and
terror
and
the
thought
of
those
who
were
to
die
on
the
morrow
appalled
every
heart
none
slept
four
days
passed
thus
on
every
morning
a
new
victim
was
taken
while
the
rest
were
forced
to
look
on
sometimes
he
went
gladly
and
rejoicing
sometimes
he
had
to
be
torn
from
his
companions
who
in
vain
strove
to
protect
him
two
suffered
made
desperate
resistance
and
their
parting
shrieks
long
rang
in
the
ears
of
the
survivors
on
the
fourth
day
the
jemadar
arrived
come
forth
he
said
to
herbert
i
would
speak
to
thee
wilt
thou
be
obdurate
o
fool
wilt
thou
longer
refuse
to
tell
of
the
money
and
the
sultaun
s
benevolence
bethink
thou
couldst
not
grant
me
a
greater
favour
than
death
said
herbert
therefore
why
are
these
things
urged
if
there
was
money
hidden
thou
shouldst
have
it
i
know
it
is
thy
god
but
there
is
none
therefore
let
me
die
i
tell
thee
once
for
all
i
spurn
thy
master
s
offers
with
dost
thou
know
what
this
death
is
said
the
jemadar
thou
shalt
see
and
he
called
to
several
of
the
guards
who
stood
around
herbert
thought
as
they
led
him
to
the
brink
that
his
time
was
come
i
come
i
come
amy
he
cried
at
length
i
come
o
god
be
merciful
to
me
they
led
him
passively
to
the
brink
the
jemadar
stood
there
already
it
was
a
dizzy
place
and
herbert
s
eyes
swam
as
he
surveyed
it
thou
art
not
to
die
feringhee
said
the
jemadar
but
look
over
behold
what
will
be
thy
fate
herbert
obeyed
mechanically
and
the
men
held
him
fast
on
the
very
verge
or
the
temptation
would
have
been
strong
to
have
ridden
himself
of
life
he
looked
down
the
hot
and
glaring
sunlight
fell
full
on
the
mangled
remains
of
his
comrades
which
lay
in
a
confused
heap
at
the
bottom
a
hundred
vultures
were
scrambling
over
each
other
to
get
at
them
and
the
bodies
were
snatched
to
and
fro
by
their
united
efforts
the
jemadar
heaved
a
fragment
of
rock
over
which
rebounding
from
the
side
crashed
among
the
brushwood
and
the
obscene
birds
they
arose
screaming
at
being
disturbed
and
two
or
three
jackals
skulked
away
through
the
brushwood
but
herbert
saw
not
these
the
first
glance
and
the
putrid
smell
which
came
up
had
sickened
him
weak
and
excited
as
he
was
and
he
fainted
chapter
xxiv
he
has
fainted
or
is
dead
cried
the
men
who
held
him
to
the
jemadar
who
was
busied
in
heaving
over
another
fragment
of
rock
he
has
fainted
shall
we
fling
him
over
for
your
lives
do
not
cried
the
jemadar
draw
back
from
us
see
what
is
the
they
obeyed
him
and
laid
herbert
down
softly
upon
the
rock
while
the
jemadar
stood
over
him
his
hand
was
powerless
and
cold
his
face
quite
pale
and
he
looked
as
though
he
were
dead
he
has
cheated
us
said
the
jemadar
to
those
around
surely
he
is
dead
who
prates
now
of
the
valour
of
the
feringhees
even
this
leader
among
them
could
not
look
on
a
few
dead
bodies
without
fainting
like
a
woman
thooh
i
spit
on
the
kafirs
i
marvel
that
the
sultaun
so
desires
him
to
enter
the
service
and
is
at
such
trouble
about
he
will
die
said
one
of
the
men
his
hand
grows
colder
and
he
must
not
die
yet
pochul
said
jaffar
sahib
what
would
the
sultaun
say
to
us
away
get
some
water
he
may
revive
this
is
only
a
faint
the
effect
of
terror
he
will
soon
speak
the
man
obeyed
the
order
and
brought
water
they
dashed
some
on
herbert
s
face
and
opening
his
lips
poured
some
between
his
tightly
closed
teeth
but
it
was
in
vain
he
moved
not
nor
showed
signs
of
life
for
a
long
while
and
was
it
not
that
his
body
continued
warm
they
would
have
thought
him
dead
at
length
he
sighed
and
opening
his
eyes
gazed
wildly
around
him
the
effort
was
greeted
with
a
shout
from
those
about
him
which
he
appeared
not
to
hear
but
sank
back
again
insensible
again
they
essayed
to
revive
him
as
they
best
could
and
after
a
long
time
partially
succeeded
as
before
but
it
was
only
to
see
him
relapse
again
and
again
once
or
twice
he
spoke
but
incoherently
for
some
hours
he
continued
thus
at
last
a
violent
shivering
commenced
and
seeing
him
so
affected
for
the
jemadar
had
left
them
for
a
while
having
given
the
men
strict
orders
to
look
carefully
to
herbert
and
to
remove
him
to
their
guardhouse
as
they
were
aware
he
was
a
person
of
more
than
ordinary
consequence
they
used
what
means
they
could
to
alleviate
his
sufferings
one
lent
him
his
rozaee
or
quilted
counterpane
another
kneaded
his
limbs
or
chafed
his
hands
a
third
heated
cloths
and
applied
them
to
his
back
and
head
but
it
was
in
vain
the
shivering
continued
accompanied
at
times
with
dreadful
sickness
after
being
in
this
state
for
awhile
he
broke
into
a
violent
burning
exhausting
excited
him
furiously
now
he
raved
wildly
he
spoke
sometimes
in
english
sometimes
in
hindostanee
and
as
none
of
the
men
around
him
understood
either
they
held
a
hurried
consultation
among
themselves
and
came
to
the
resolution
of
selecting
one
of
the
prisoners
to
remain
with
him
and
minister
to
his
wants
the
office
was
gladly
accepted
by
the
man
they
chose
whose
name
was
bolton
and
whom
they
fixed
on
because
he
had
been
seen
in
conversation
with
herbert
more
than
the
rest
and
could
speak
a
few
words
of
their
language
canarese
which
he
had
learned
where
he
had
been
last
confined
all
that
night
was
passed
by
the
unfortunate
young
man
in
violent
raving
the
consequence
of
the
raging
fever
which
consumed
him
he
tossed
incessantly
to
and
fro
in
the
small
corded
bed
upon
which
he
had
been
laid
now
yelling
forth
in
the
agony
he
suffered
from
his
head
which
he
held
with
both
his
hands
and
now
moaning
piteously
so
that
even
the
rough
guards
felt
compassion
for
the
young
and
helpless
englishman
water
was
the
only
coherent
word
he
could
utter
the
rest
was
a
continued
unintelligible
muttering
in
which
some
english
words
and
names
were
sometimes
faintly
discernible
poor
bolton
did
what
he
could
but
it
was
in
vain
and
when
the
jemadar
returned
in
the
morning
for
the
purpose
of
adding
another
victim
to
his
last
he
found
herbert
in
such
a
state
as
to
alarm
him
for
the
sultaun
had
sworn
he
would
have
life
for
life
if
aught
happened
to
him
he
must
be
removed
instantly
he
said
away
one
of
ye
for
a
dooly
bring
it
to
the
foot
of
the
will
carry
him
down
thither
and
he
must
be
removed
to
the
in
the
end
too
he
was
merciful
for
he
took
bolton
with
him
to
attend
on
herbert
while
he
should
live
it
could
not
be
long
he
thought
for
he
raved
incessantly
until
exhaustion
ensued
and
he
gained
fresh
strength
for
further
frantic
efforts
and
they
left
the
fatal
rock
soon
afterwards
the
only
two
of
that
numerous
company
alive
nor
was
the
fate
of
the
rest
long
protracted
they
were
murdered
as
the
rest
had
been
and
the
bleached
bones
and
skulls
and
fragments
of
clothes
which
had
no
shape
to
tell
to
whom
they
had
they
had
been
stripped
from
the
dead
by
the
beaks
of
vultures
and
teeth
of
to
those
who
long
afterwards
looked
on
the
place
that
the
tales
they
had
heard
of
the
horrors
of
that
fatal
rock
and
which
they
had
in
part
disbelieved
were
not
unfounded
it
was
on
a
mild
and
balmy
evening
that
herbert
awoke
to
consciousness
about
a
week
after
he
had
been
removed
he
looked
languidly
around
him
for
he
was
so
weak
that
even
the
effort
he
made
to
raise
himself
caused
a
giddy
faintness
and
for
an
instant
the
remembrance
of
his
last
conscious
moment
upon
the
brink
of
the
precipice
flashed
across
his
mind
and
he
shuddered
at
the
recollection
of
what
he
had
seen
again
he
looked
around
but
he
was
not
upon
the
rock
the
fatal
and
wretched
abode
in
which
he
had
passed
five
days
of
enduring
agony
as
he
could
not
have
believed
it
possible
to
its
bare
walls
scrawled
all
over
with
the
names
of
its
miserable
inhabitants
and
their
despairing
and
almost
maniac
faces
were
around
him
no
longer
he
lay
in
the
open
air
under
the
shade
of
a
upon
a
mound
of
earth
surrounding
a
tomb
which
from
its
clean
state
and
the
garlands
of
flowers
which
hung
upon
it
was
evidently
that
of
a
mahomedan
saint
or
holy
martyr
at
a
short
distance
was
a
small
mosque
exquisitely
white
and
clean
behind
which
rose
some
noble
and
with
them
and
plantains
which
formed
an
appropriate
background
to
the
pureness
of
the
building
their
foliage
partly
shaded
and
intermingled
with
the
minarets
and
ornamented
pinnacles
of
the
mosque
before
it
was
a
little
garden
where
flourished
luxuriantly
a
or
two
covered
with
their
bright
scarlet
few
marigolds
and
cockscombs
intermixed
with
mint
and
other
sweet
herbs
which
appeared
to
be
cultivated
with
care
the
space
around
the
tomb
and
before
the
mosque
and
for
a
considerable
extent
all
round
was
carefully
swept
and
the
branches
of
the
peepul
and
which
met
and
interweaved
high
above
formed
a
cover
impenetrable
by
the
rays
of
the
fiercest
sun
at
but
it
was
now
evening
and
the
red
light
streamed
in
a
flood
between
the
stems
of
the
trees
lighting
up
the
gnarled
branches
of
the
peepul
and
the
thick
foliage
beyond
innumerable
parroquets
and
minas
screamed
and
twittered
in
the
branches
above
him
and
flew
from
place
to
place
restlessly
but
the
only
sound
of
man
was
from
one
drawing
water
for
the
garden
by
the
aid
of
the
lever
and
bucket
common
to
mysore
whose
monotonous
yet
not
unmusical
song
and
mellow
voice
ceased
only
to
allow
the
delicious
sound
of
the
rush
of
water
to
reach
herbert
s
ear
as
the
bucket
was
emptied
from
time
to
time
into
the
reservoir
which
supplied
the
garden
he
lay
in
a
half
unconscious
state
in
that
dreamy
languor
which
when
fierce
fever
has
subsided
is
almost
painful
from
its
vagueness
when
the
mind
striving
to
recall
the
past
wanders
away
into
thoughts
which
have
no
reference
to
it
but
which
lose
themselves
in
a
maze
of
unreal
illusions
too
subtle
and
shifting
to
be
followed
and
yet
too
pleasant
to
excite
aught
but
tranquil
images
and
soothing
effects
the
sun
sank
in
glory
such
glory
behind
the
mountains
beyond
as
herbert
had
never
before
witnessed
save
once
when
he
was
at
sea
and
the
land
which
held
him
a
prisoner
and
was
his
living
grave
appeared
in
sight
as
the
evening
fell
and
the
golden
tints
of
the
west
faded
giving
place
to
the
rich
hues
of
crimson
and
purple
which
spread
over
it
the
sonorous
voice
of
the
muezzin
from
a
corner
of
the
enclosure
proclaimed
the
evening
worship
and
in
the
melancholy
yet
melodious
tone
of
the
invitation
called
the
believers
to
prayer
a
few
devout
answered
to
it
and
advancing
from
one
side
performed
their
ablutions
at
a
little
fountain
which
cast
up
a
tiny
thread
of
spray
into
the
air
this
done
they
entered
the
mosque
and
marshalled
in
a
row
went
through
with
apparent
fervour
the
various
forms
and
genuflexions
prescribed
by
their
belief
afterwards
two
advanced
towards
herbert
a
venerable
man
in
the
garb
of
a
fakeer
the
other
a
gentleman
of
respectable
appearance
who
from
the
sword
he
carried
under
his
arm
might
be
an
officer
herbert
heard
one
say
most
likely
he
is
dead
now
he
was
dying
when
we
last
saw
him
and
his
attendant
went
with
jaffar
sahib
to
purchase
his
poor
fellow
he
was
unwilling
to
go
but
the
jemadar
forced
him
i
have
hope
said
the
old
fakeer
the
medicine
i
gave
him
praised
be
the
power
of
alla
has
rarely
failed
in
such
cases
and
if
the
paroxysm
is
past
he
will
herbert
heard
this
and
strove
to
speak
his
lips
moved
but
no
words
followed
above
a
whisper
he
was
weaker
than
an
infant
but
now
the
fakeer
advanced
to
him
and
felt
his
hand
and
head
they
were
cool
and
moist
and
herbert
turned
to
look
on
them
with
a
heart
full
of
gratitude
at
the
kindness
and
interest
which
their
words
and
looks
expressed
ya
ruhman
ya
salaam
oh
he
lives
he
is
free
from
the
disease
blessed
be
the
power
of
alla
is
once
more
among
the
living
therefore
rejoice
o
feringhee
exclaimed
the
fakeer
and
bless
alla
that
thou
livest
for
he
hath
been
merciful
to
thee
six
days
hast
thou
lain
in
yonder
serai
and
the
breath
was
in
thy
nostrils
but
it
hath
now
returned
to
thy
heart
so
be
i
am
grateful
for
thy
kindness
shah
sahib
said
herbert
speaking
very
faintly
he
had
learned
the
usual
appellation
of
all
respectable
fakeers
long
alla
will
reward
thee
i
pray
thee
tell
me
who
thou
art
and
where
i
am
methinks
i
trouble
not
thyself
to
think
on
the
past
he
replied
it
was
not
destined
to
be
and
thy
life
is
for
the
present
safe
thou
art
in
the
garden
of
the
poor
slave
of
alla
and
the
apostle
sheikh
furreed
of
a
worthy
fakeer
and
one
on
whom
the
power
to
work
miracles
hath
descended
in
this
degenerate
time
said
his
companion
one
who
may
well
be
called
wullee
and
who
will
be
honoured
in
i
have
an
indifferent
skill
in
medicine
said
the
fakeer
but
to
the
rest
i
have
no
pretensions
khan
sahib
but
we
should
not
speak
to
the
youth
let
him
be
quiet
the
air
will
revive
him
and
when
they
return
he
shall
be
carried
back
to
the
they
left
him
and
ere
long
he
heard
footsteps
approaching
a
figure
was
running
towards
could
not
surely
be
was
an
english
face
he
came
was
bolton
the
poor
fellow
sobbed
with
very
joy
when
he
saw
his
officer
released
as
it
were
from
the
jaws
of
death
he
hung
over
him
and
bathed
his
hand
with
tears
he
little
expected
ever
to
have
heard
him
speak
again
now
his
officer
lived
and
while
a
load
of
sorrow
was
removed
from
his
heart
he
blessed
god
that
he
had
been
so
merciful
i
have
carried
you
forth
day
by
day
in
my
arms
and
laid
you
yonder
said
the
faithful
fellow
as
he
lifted
him
up
like
a
child
they
said
you
would
die
and
i
thought
if
you
were
sensible
before
that
time
came
you
would
like
to
be
in
this
shady
cool
place
where
the
light
would
not
be
too
strong
for
you
the
fresh
air
would
play
over
you
and
you
could
look
around
upon
the
green
trees
and
gardens
ere
you
went
herbert
could
only
press
his
hand
in
silence
for
his
heart
was
too
full
to
speak
indeed
he
was
too
weak
also
for
in
being
carried
to
the
serai
once
more
he
fainted
and
it
was
long
ere
he
recovered
but
that
night
a
few
mouthfuls
of
were
given
him
and
he
slept
peacefully
noiseless
almost
breathless
sleep
which
is
attendant
on
extreme
weakness
when
dreams
and
pleasant
phantasies
flit
before
the
imagination
like
shadows
chasing
each
other
over
beautiful
prospects
when
the
day
is
bright
and
soft
herbert
s
visions
were
of
home
of
walks
in
the
twilight
with
amy
of
her
soft
words
of
the
plashing
of
the
river
in
their
haunts
sacred
to
him
by
the
dearest
and
holiest
ties
he
woke
in
the
morning
refreshed
and
strengthened
he
could
now
speak
he
could
converse
with
the
soldier
who
had
watched
over
him
so
devotedly
and
he
learned
from
him
all
that
had
occurred
you
were
delirious
sir
he
said
and
i
was
sent
for
from
among
the
rest
poor
fellows
i
hear
they
are
all
murdered
i
thought
you
had
been
struck
by
the
sun
for
you
were
bareheaded
perhaps
it
was
so
for
you
were
quite
mad
and
very
violent
they
brought
you
here
in
the
dooly
which
was
sent
for
by
the
jemadar
and
at
first
no
one
would
receive
you
you
lay
raving
in
the
bazaar
and
people
avoided
you
as
they
would
have
done
a
devil
even
called
you
one
but
the
good
fakeer
who
lives
here
saw
you
by
chance
and
took
you
away
from
them
and
he
has
watched
you
and
given
you
various
medicines
which
have
made
you
i
fear
very
weak
sir
but
you
are
better
so
they
were
all
murdered
said
herbert
his
thoughts
reverting
to
the
past
they
were
sir
but
why
think
of
that
now
it
will
distress
should
not
there
are
brighter
things
in
store
for
you
depend
on
alas
said
herbert
i
fear
not
bolton
but
since
god
has
spared
me
from
that
death
and
protected
me
through
this
dreadful
illness
of
which
i
have
a
confused
remembrance
surely
it
is
not
too
much
to
and
he
did
hope
and
from
his
soul
he
breathed
a
fervent
prayer
for
through
the
future
there
appeared
a
glimmering
ray
of
hope
on
which
his
mind
loved
to
rest
though
clouds
and
dark
vapours
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
would
rise
up
occasionally
and
obscure
it
day
by
day
however
he
recovered
strength
and
the
old
fakeer
sate
by
him
often
and
beguiled
the
time
with
tales
and
legends
of
the
mighty
of
the
earth
who
were
dead
and
gone
it
was
a
dreamy
existence
to
live
weak
and
helpless
among
those
shady
groves
to
lie
for
hours
listening
to
the
trees
as
the
wind
rustled
through
their
thick
foliage
watching
the
birds
of
varied
plumage
as
they
flitted
among
their
branches
while
his
ear
was
filled
with
wild
legends
of
love
of
war
of
crime
or
of
revenge
but
this
had
an
was
too
bright
too
peaceful
to
last
when
a
week
had
elapsed
the
jemadar
who
had
avoided
him
studiously
during
his
recovery
came
to
him
with
the
fakeer
for
knowing
herbert
s
detestation
of
him
he
had
not
dared
to
venture
alone
the
jemadar
hath
news
for
thee
my
son
said
the
old
man
fear
not
he
will
not
harm
would
not
let
him
do
so
he
hath
shown
me
the
sultaun
s
letter
to
him
which
arrived
a
short
time
ago
by
an
listen
feringhee
said
jaffar
sahib
the
shah
sahib
will
bear
me
witness
that
there
is
no
wrong
intended
thee
my
royal
master
doth
but
seek
his
own
and
still
asketh
thee
for
the
shah
sahib
said
herbert
hear
me
say
and
be
witness
that
as
alla
whom
we
both
worship
sees
my
heart
that
it
is
pure
of
deceit
know
nought
of
it
unlike
those
who
loaded
themselves
with
money
and
plundered
the
treasury
at
bednore
i
and
a
few
others
never
touched
it
canst
thou
not
believe
that
to
save
my
life
i
would
have
told
if
i
had
known
aught
of
it
i
believe
that
thou
wouldst
my
son
there
must
have
been
lakhs
of
money
and
jewels
buried
there
or
destroyed
said
the
jemadar
else
where
is
the
treasure
every
one
was
searched
and
yet
not
half
was
found
that
i
myself
saw
there
before
what
asked
the
fakeer
whose
curiosity
was
raised
let
him
tell
his
own
tale
of
shame
if
he
can
said
herbert
i
would
not
so
humble
him
though
he
is
my
enemy
for
some
reason
that
i
know
not
thou
knowest
well
i
have
cause
to
be
so
said
the
jemadar
with
bitter
rancour
in
his
tone
but
this
is
foolishness
here
is
the
sultaun
s
letter
thou
must
either
tell
of
the
treasure
or
go
again
into
confinement
of
it
and
thou
wilt
be
freed
and
sent
on
an
embassy
to
thine
own
people
and
the
alternative
is
thy
doom
choose
this
at
least
there
is
no
alas
i
am
but
mocked
said
herbert
sadly
i
have
given
thee
my
answer
so
many
times
that
this
is
but
torment
exciting
hope
that
makes
me
dream
of
joy
i
can
never
realise
my
own
to
them
i
am
dead
long
ago
but
why
speculate
i
tell
thee
before
this
holy
witness
my
kind
and
benevolent
friend
that
i
have
no
other
reply
to
give
than
that
thou
it
is
well
sahib
fate
is
cast
the
old
prison
at
bangalore
awaits
thee
where
if
alla
give
thee
long
life
thou
art
fortunate
but
where
speedy
death
will
be
thy
most
probable
it
will
be
welcome
said
herbert
but
while
i
have
life
i
will
remember
thee
o
fakeer
who
hast
been
to
me
a
friend
in
bitter
adversity
when
to
all
others
i
was
accursed
when
am
i
to
travel
replied
the
jemadar
the
letter
is
peremptory
if
thou
art
strong
enough
to
bear
the
he
is
not
said
the
fakeer
he
is
still
weak
on
my
head
be
the
blame
of
his
remaining
no
said
herbert
i
am
feeble
it
is
true
but
let
it
be
as
the
sultaun
wills
i
am
too
long
accustomed
to
hardship
to
resist
or
object
and
thou
my
friend
wouldst
only
bring
down
his
wrath
upon
thee
by
keeping
me
here
yet
think
when
i
am
gone
from
this
our
short
acquaintance
that
our
race
can
be
grateful
and
when
thou
hearest
us
reviled
say
that
we
are
not
as
our
slanderers
speak
of
us
for
myself
while
i
have
life
i
will
remember
thee
as
a
kind
and
dear
friend
and
if
alla
wills
it
we
may
meet
if
alla
wills
it
moojeeb
ya
kubeer
ya
grant
that
it
may
be
that
we
may
meet
footnote
o
answerer
of
prayer
footnote
o
lord
of
power
footnote
o
most
sublime
and
full
of
regret
of
pain
at
parting
with
his
old
and
true
friend
shedding
tears
for
he
was
weak
in
body
and
in
mind
as
he
left
those
quiet
peaceful
groves
and
green
shades
the
memory
of
his
fearful
illness
his
kind
nursing
and
the
devotion
of
their
possessor
fresh
and
vivid
in
his
thoughts
left
the
place
the
next
day
accompanied
by
his
comrade
in
captivity
whose
only
hope
now
was
that
they
should
never
again
be
separated
in
the
secrecy
of
friendship
he
had
procured
a
pen
and
paper
from
the
old
fakeer
and
had
written
a
few
lines
to
the
governor
of
madras
stating
who
he
was
and
that
he
still
lived
this
the
old
man
promised
to
send
whenever
an
opportunity
occurred
but
he
was
herbert
thought
and
there
was
but
little
hope
that
it
would
ever
reach
its
destination
the
journey
did
not
fatigue
him
as
he
had
expected
in
contrast
to
the
hurried
travel
in
coming
they
returned
to
bangalore
in
three
days
and
herbert
was
even
stronger
and
better
for
the
exertion
he
expected
once
more
his
old
cell
and
the
company
of
books
even
sometimes
a
word
with
his
kind
friend
the
killadar
but
there
was
another
trial
in
store
for
him
of
which
he
could
have
had
no
was
terrible
in
contemplation
it
would
seem
as
if
the
capricious
mind
of
the
sultaun
was
never
settled
to
one
point
about
herbert
order
after
order
was
revoked
and
others
substituted
the
last
which
met
him
at
bangalore
was
that
herbert
should
be
taken
to
a
solitary
mountain
fortress
beyond
mysore
in
a
region
which
was
known
to
be
inclement
and
from
whence
tidings
of
his
existence
could
never
find
their
way
he
had
been
passive
in
the
hands
of
his
captors
now
for
years
and
this
fresh
mark
of
tyranny
was
nothing
new
nor
the
changes
in
the
sultaun
s
designs
for
him
to
be
wondered
at
a
few
days
delay
occurred
at
bangalore
where
some
suits
of
coarse
but
thickly
quilted
clothes
were
given
to
him
two
or
three
blankets
a
counterpane
and
a
few
other
necessaries
and
he
once
more
journeyed
onwards
a
bitter
pang
to
him
was
the
loss
of
his
faithful
friend
and
attendant
bolton
who
was
not
permitted
to
accompany
him
they
separated
in
sorrow
but
they
exchanged
written
memoranda
of
each
other
s
history
to
be
made
known
to
their
countrymen
in
case
either
had
ever
an
opportunity
herbert
travelled
many
days
following
at
first
the
road
to
seringapatam
the
party
struck
off
to
the
left
when
near
the
city
there
he
was
rid
of
the
hateful
presence
of
the
jemadar
who
to
the
last
urged
him
to
confess
the
existence
of
the
treasure
and
repeated
his
offers
of
conniving
at
his
flight
should
he
disclose
it
at
length
a
blue
wall
of
mountains
appeared
in
the
far
distance
their
bases
were
wreathed
with
vapours
which
rolled
along
their
sides
but
never
appeared
to
reach
the
summit
day
after
day
as
they
approached
them
nearer
their
giant
forms
displayed
themselves
in
grander
and
more
majestic
beauty
what
had
appeared
chasms
and
rents
in
their
sides
when
the
light
rested
on
them
now
revealed
valleys
and
thickly
wooded
glens
into
which
imagination
strove
to
penetrate
in
speculation
of
their
real
loveliness
at
length
they
reached
the
pass
which
from
the
of
mysore
descends
into
the
plain
of
coimbatoor
and
from
thence
the
boundless
prospect
which
met
herbert
s
eye
filled
his
mind
with
delight
and
rapture
the
blue
distance
melted
into
the
sky
by
a
succession
of
the
tenderest
tints
away
through
the
plains
rolled
the
bhowanee
a
silver
thread
glittering
amidst
the
most
exquisite
colours
the
huge
mountains
were
on
his
right
and
rugged
sides
here
hewn
into
deep
chasms
and
again
clothed
with
woods
of
a
luxuriance
which
he
had
never
before
seen
equalled
in
the
distance
of
the
lofty
chain
one
mountain
of
peculiar
form
whose
sides
were
naked
precipices
stood
out
boldly
against
the
blue
plain
the
soldiers
pointed
to
it
exultingly
and
when
he
asked
them
the
reason
he
was
told
that
it
was
his
destination
they
descended
everywhere
the
same
noble
views
the
same
glory
of
the
works
of
heaven
which
herbert
worshipped
in
his
heart
met
his
gaze
having
passed
along
the
foot
of
the
mountains
for
two
days
and
approached
them
nearer
and
nearer
they
began
to
ascend
below
the
rugged
pass
the
mighty
forests
the
huge
bamboos
the
giant
creepers
and
their
lovely
flowers
had
filled
herbert
s
mind
with
wonder
and
awe
as
he
ascended
this
gave
place
to
feelings
of
delight
the
path
was
rugged
and
stony
and
the
pony
he
rode
for
which
the
dooly
had
been
exchanged
beneath
the
pass
climbed
but
slowly
and
he
was
obliged
to
rest
him
occasionally
while
he
turned
round
to
enjoy
the
mighty
prospect
how
grand
it
was
to
see
the
high
of
mysore
breaking
into
the
plain
in
mountains
of
four
thousand
feet
high
of
every
conceivable
form
and
bathed
in
the
bright
light
of
an
indian
sun
while
the
boundless
plains
stretched
away
from
their
feet
as
he
ascended
the
air
blew
cooler
and
cooler
and
plants
and
beautiful
flowers
new
to
him
grew
profusely
by
the
wayside
at
last
he
could
not
be
fern
how
his
heart
bounded
as
he
plucked
it
and
kissed
its
form
a
little
higher
there
was
a
bed
of
blue
flowers
peering
from
among
the
luxuriant
shrubs
they
had
familiar
faces
stopped
and
dismounting
ran
to
them
they
were
violets
same
as
those
with
which
he
had
a
thousand
times
filled
his
amy
s
lap
in
summer
time
when
they
were
children
full
his
heart
was
further
on
a
brake
of
brambles
met
his
eye
the
ripe
black
fruit
was
a
luxury
to
him
such
as
he
had
not
dreamed
of
and
below
them
a
bed
of
wild
strawberries
the
same
as
they
had
grown
in
the
beechwood
groves
and
round
the
hermitage
he
was
now
near
the
summit
the
air
was
cold
and
fresh
like
that
of
england
the
sky
was
bluer
than
below
and
a
few
light
fleecy
clouds
floated
about
the
veiling
its
beauty
they
still
advanced
and
he
was
in
rapture
he
could
not
speak
his
thoughts
could
only
find
vent
in
thanksgiving
a
familiar
flower
caught
his
eye
in
a
bush
above
his
head
it
was
same
and
as
fragrant
as
in
england
herbert
s
heart
was
already
full
to
overflowing
and
thoughts
of
the
past
increased
by
these
simple
objects
were
too
powerful
for
him
to
bear
calmly
he
could
resist
nature
s
best
relief
no
longer
and
which
soothed
him
as
they
flowed
and
while
he
sate
down
and
with
dim
and
streaming
eyes
gazed
over
the
almost
boundless
prospect
he
felt
that
if
he
could
have
passed
away
to
another
existence
with
those
feelings
it
would
have
been
bliss
chapter
xxv
some
years
have
now
elapsed
since
philip
dalton
parted
from
his
friend
herbert
at
bednore
upon
the
mission
of
the
unfortunate
mathews
and
it
becomes
necessary
to
revert
to
him
for
a
while
in
order
to
present
successively
the
various
events
which
belong
to
our
history
in
such
a
manner
as
may
best
serve
to
fix
them
upon
the
reader
s
attention
and
which
from
their
connection
though
at
considerable
distances
of
time
it
is
needful
to
follow
to
the
end
in
their
true
order
philip
s
journey
to
the
coast
was
rapid
but
he
had
time
once
more
to
tread
the
ground
which
was
the
scene
of
that
spirited
conflict
once
more
to
visit
the
grave
of
his
young
companion
which
was
undisturbed
and
he
saw
with
satisfaction
that
the
simple
monument
which
they
had
ordered
to
be
erected
over
it
to
preserve
it
from
being
molested
as
well
as
to
mark
the
place
was
in
a
state
of
forwardness
and
would
soon
be
finished
in
a
few
days
more
the
party
were
at
the
coast
and
finding
vessels
there
belonging
to
the
government
they
embarked
and
with
the
soft
and
favourable
breezes
of
the
season
soon
reached
their
destination
in
safety
here
now
ensued
a
scene
of
bitter
contention
among
the
friends
of
both
parties
and
opinions
ran
high
on
both
sides
while
the
one
urged
the
incompetency
the
neglect
of
orders
and
caution
and
the
obstinacy
of
mathews
in
not
listening
to
the
advice
of
those
well
calculated
by
their
rank
and
experience
to
give
it
there
were
also
those
who
argued
that
in
all
his
acts
mathews
was
fully
justified
should
disaster
come
the
government
of
the
island
was
alone
to
blame
in
having
directed
him
to
undertake
operations
of
such
magnitude
with
means
so
insignificant
which
though
they
had
been
eminently
successful
he
could
not
be
expected
to
maintain
without
large
and
speedy
reinforcements
before
the
council
however
the
affairs
were
argued
with
calmness
and
temper
the
letters
of
mathews
certainly
threw
no
light
upon
his
position
his
means
of
defence
or
intelligence
of
the
enemy
and
though
philip
dalton
defended
his
commander
with
zeal
and
temper
he
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
there
were
many
points
on
which
he
in
common
with
others
had
offered
advice
that
had
been
the
neglect
of
which
could
not
be
otherwise
than
injurious
to
the
discipline
of
the
army
which
had
already
suffered
in
a
great
degree
the
arguments
against
mathews
finally
prevailed
and
the
orders
for
his
supercession
in
the
command
were
given
to
macleod
who
with
shaw
and
humberstone
already
mentioned
took
a
speedy
departure
from
bombay
a
severe
indisposition
prevented
philip
s
accompanying
them
as
he
had
intended
for
macleod
aware
of
his
talent
zeal
and
military
skill
had
offered
him
the
same
office
on
his
own
staff
which
he
had
filled
with
mathews
and
he
had
accepted
it
and
as
the
government
had
promised
a
reinforcement
which
the
commanders
represented
as
absolutely
necessary
to
enable
them
to
hold
the
ground
they
had
acquired
there
was
an
opportunity
for
proceeding
with
troops
this
besides
being
more
agreeable
to
philip
would
enable
him
to
be
of
use
to
the
officer
who
was
nominated
to
the
command
from
his
knowledge
of
the
road
and
of
the
country
but
he
was
destined
never
to
proceed
the
three
commanders
who
had
sailed
from
bombay
in
a
small
armed
vessel
belonging
to
the
government
were
attacked
off
the
mahratta
fort
of
gheriah
by
some
heavy
mahratta
vessels
for
which
they
were
no
match
the
officers
defended
themselves
and
their
charge
bravely
and
made
a
determined
though
ineffectual
resistance
in
which
one
of
their
number
the
gallant
humberstone
lost
his
life
the
others
with
the
crew
and
vessel
were
carried
into
gheriah
and
it
was
not
until
after
a
long
lapse
of
time
that
their
release
was
effected
when
the
news
of
this
disaster
reached
bombay
it
retarded
the
preparations
for
embarkation
which
were
being
made
for
the
troops
and
ere
many
weeks
had
passed
the
sad
intelligence
of
the
disaster
at
bednore
completed
the
distress
and
consternation
of
the
presidency
from
the
few
that
escaped
who
magnified
the
terrors
of
the
event
and
described
in
fearful
terms
the
miseries
endured
by
the
prisoners
from
the
reports
of
the
cruelties
exercised
upon
them
which
had
long
been
prevalent
and
were
known
to
be
well
had
despaired
of
ever
gaining
intelligence
of
his
friend
herbert
and
while
he
wrote
to
his
family
whose
direction
he
was
in
possession
of
to
inform
them
of
the
sad
event
and
to
tell
them
that
herbert
was
known
to
have
been
in
good
health
when
he
was
taken
with
the
rest
he
could
give
them
but
little
hope
as
to
the
final
issue
indeed
upon
this
point
he
was
quite
silent
as
having
no
hope
himself
he
was
unable
to
impart
any
to
them
he
did
not
however
write
for
several
months
after
the
intelligence
had
been
received
at
bombay
for
the
letters
he
had
dispatched
for
herbert
immediately
on
his
arrival
would
he
hoped
prevent
his
family
from
being
over
anxious
and
he
thought
that
perhaps
news
might
arrive
of
the
prisoners
of
their
health
and
condition
which
would
be
acceptable
or
that
some
treaty
might
be
arranged
between
the
english
and
mysore
governments
which
would
put
an
end
to
their
captivity
indeed
it
was
in
the
latter
confident
hope
that
he
wrote
when
all
prospect
of
an
immediate
release
was
out
of
the
question
the
letters
which
herbert
had
dispatched
had
reached
england
and
by
them
his
family
were
informed
of
the
issue
of
the
war
as
far
as
the
capture
of
bednore
and
he
then
wrote
in
the
highest
spirits
like
a
young
and
gallant
soldier
of
the
prospects
of
the
campaign
made
light
of
his
wound
and
was
eagerly
looking
for
fresh
encounters
with
the
enemy
in
which
distinction
and
promotion
were
to
be
won
this
account
greatly
soothed
his
parents
and
amy
who
was
especially
tormented
by
agonising
fears
and
apprehensions
regarding
him
in
spite
of
his
often
repeated
but
playful
assurances
that
he
was
safe
and
well
he
can
not
be
safe
she
used
to
argue
to
herself
when
there
are
such
desperate
engagements
as
that
of
which
he
writes
us
word
and
where
he
has
too
the
baneful
climate
to
contend
against
but
god
is
over
all
and
to
him
i
commit
the
future
in
hope
and
and
so
she
vague
dread
of
future
misery
striving
for
mastery
in
her
heart
with
deep
religious
reliance
and
during
this
struggle
her
parents
became
from
her
altered
appearance
so
anxious
for
her
that
they
would
fain
have
removed
her
to
one
of
the
for
change
of
air
and
scene
she
firmly
opposed
the
proposal
for
she
clung
with
increasing
attachment
to
her
home
and
apparently
to
the
pursuits
which
herbert
had
shared
with
her
but
if
they
looked
at
her
sketches
there
used
to
be
little
advance
made
from
day
to
day
she
would
sit
for
hours
seemingly
engaged
on
them
whilst
her
eye
was
fixed
upon
vacancy
or
gazing
upon
the
familiar
spots
she
was
delineating
where
she
had
often
watched
his
figure
or
realising
to
her
tenacious
memory
all
the
words
she
had
heard
him
speak
there
and
thus
the
time
passed
her
companionship
with
the
family
of
herbert
increased
and
she
would
spend
days
in
conversing
with
them
especially
with
compton
about
him
listening
to
every
tale
of
his
life
every
incident
even
of
his
childhood
with
delight
and
an
interest
which
appeared
to
increase
in
their
repetition
but
the
suspense
after
the
receipt
of
his
last
one
dispatched
by
philip
day
by
day
more
insupportable
several
vessels
arrived
but
there
was
no
intelligence
from
herbert
many
of
the
newspapers
of
the
day
mentioned
the
expedition
with
some
criticisms
upon
its
object
and
prophesied
an
ill
termination
to
its
exertions
and
at
length
when
the
ship
arrived
by
which
she
had
expected
a
long
despatch
and
there
was
none
and
the
letter
was
read
from
herbert
s
agent
as
we
have
before
recorded
wherein
he
stated
broadly
that
there
was
bad
news
from
poor
girl
s
brain
reeled
under
the
shock
of
having
her
worst
fears
confirmed
her
active
and
already
excited
mind
in
an
instant
presented
to
her
the
being
in
whose
existence
her
own
was
wrapped
up
as
if
in
death
ghastly
with
disfiguring
wounds
and
the
thought
suddenly
as
it
had
come
into
her
mind
for
the
time
paralyzed
her
faculties
her
body
was
not
strong
enough
to
resist
its
influence
and
yielding
at
once
she
had
fainted
under
the
overpowering
weight
of
her
misery
news
however
there
was
of
herbert
which
in
some
measure
relieved
their
worst
fears
and
gave
room
for
hope
although
sickening
in
its
uncertainty
it
gave
room
for
hope
to
which
every
member
of
both
families
clung
with
the
tenacity
naturally
inspired
by
their
affection
the
newspapers
gave
such
accounts
as
could
be
gained
of
the
disaster
and
the
name
of
herbert
was
mentioned
among
those
who
were
known
to
be
in
captivity
but
they
nowhere
saw
that
of
dalton
whom
herbert
had
so
constantly
mentioned
in
his
letters
and
they
concluded
that
he
had
been
killed
in
one
of
the
engagements
this
was
an
additional
source
of
pain
to
them
that
herbert
had
lost
his
dearest
friend
however
in
a
few
months
after
the
first
letter
from
philip
arrived
at
the
rectory
and
despite
its
melancholy
tone
it
gave
the
family
good
reason
to
hope
philip
was
one
who
could
not
believe
implicitly
in
the
constant
said
to
be
exercised
by
the
sultaun
upon
his
prisoners
and
he
could
plainly
see
that
such
statements
were
encouraged
by
the
government
in
order
to
induce
those
favourable
to
their
cause
to
lend
their
aid
in
the
struggle
and
perceiving
this
he
wrote
that
he
hoped
the
treaties
about
to
be
drawn
up
between
the
two
nations
would
be
productive
not
only
of
herbert
s
release
but
of
that
of
his
undeceived
them
too
which
was
necessary
as
to
the
natives
of
the
country
being
savage
assuring
them
on
the
contrary
that
they
were
polite
and
courteous
and
as
the
hopes
of
peace
continued
to
be
confirmed
from
time
to
time
by
philip
who
wrote
by
every
opportunity
as
well
as
by
the
papers
they
remained
in
a
most
pitiable
state
of
excitement
which
was
doomed
to
be
bitterly
disappointed
the
peace
of
came
many
a
man
whose
existence
had
been
despaired
of
by
his
and
wretched
family
reappeared
and
that
of
the
rectory
now
looked
forward
with
intense
eagerness
to
the
receipt
of
letters
from
herbert
or
from
philip
dalton
announcing
their
reunion
and
the
prospect
of
their
speedy
return
home
alas
while
others
rejoiced
they
were
plunged
into
deeper
despair
than
ever
for
as
herbert
s
name
did
not
appear
in
the
lists
of
those
who
had
been
given
up
philip
did
not
immediately
write
his
bitter
disappointment
that
his
dear
friend
was
not
among
their
number
who
could
paint
the
withering
effect
of
this
miserable
intelligence
upon
the
unhappy
amy
she
had
striven
and
successfully
against
her
own
despairing
heart
whilst
a
ray
of
hope
broke
in
upon
her
gloomy
future
she
cherished
it
and
strove
to
dispel
the
clouds
which
doubt
would
in
spite
of
her
exertions
accumulate
before
her
she
was
cheerful
and
when
compton
mourned
her
son
s
early
fate
in
bitter
grief
and
almost
refused
comfort
amy
would
soothe
her
and
raise
her
to
hope
again
but
from
the
last
news
there
was
no
comfort
to
be
gained
had
herbert
been
alive
he
would
have
been
given
up
like
the
rest
and
though
it
was
suspected
at
the
time
that
many
prisoners
were
retained
by
tippoo
in
defiance
of
the
articles
of
treaty
still
that
was
so
uncertain
so
vague
and
wretched
a
hope
that
it
was
abandoned
as
even
sinful
to
indulge
in
and
herbert
was
mourned
as
dead
it
was
happy
perhaps
for
amy
that
her
own
grief
was
in
a
measure
diverted
by
the
long
illness
of
compton
whom
the
violence
of
the
affliction
brought
to
the
very
verge
of
the
grave
for
many
months
did
the
gentle
and
patient
girl
minister
to
her
who
was
to
have
been
her
mother
with
a
devotion
of
affection
which
hardly
found
its
equal
in
that
of
her
own
daughter
from
no
one
s
hand
did
the
sufferer
take
the
remedies
prescribed
so
readily
as
from
amy
s
none
could
smooth
the
pillow
of
the
languid
invalid
like
read
to
her
so
sweetly
none
conversed
with
her
upon
their
favourite
who
was
lost
to
them
eloquently
and
so
devotedly
as
amy
and
her
beauty
which
had
grown
up
with
her
years
until
it
was
now
surpassingly
meek
and
cheerful
resignation
after
the
first
pang
of
sorrow
was
unceasing
and
untiring
her
an
object
of
peculiar
interest
to
the
neighbourhood
of
all
ranks
to
whom
her
sad
story
and
early
trials
were
known
calm
and
cheerful
as
she
usually
was
in
the
society
of
her
family
and
at
the
rectory
no
one
but
her
mother
knew
the
bitter
bursts
of
grief
to
which
nature
would
force
her
sometimes
when
the
memory
of
him
they
thought
dead
was
more
prominently
excited
herbert
was
constantly
the
subject
of
their
conversation
for
this
amy
loved
and
it
often
soothed
her
to
hear
him
spoken
of
or
alluded
to
but
it
was
not
this
that
affected
her
it
was
often
the
merest
trifle
and
sudden
thought
the
sight
of
a
flower
a
word
or
tone
from
charles
who
now
strongly
resembled
his
brother
that
caused
these
paroxysms
which
violent
as
they
were
prostrated
her
for
the
time
only
to
rise
with
renewed
cheerfulness
resignation
and
affection
for
those
she
loved
they
continued
to
hear
from
philip
dalton
who
restless
under
the
belief
that
herbert
still
lived
spared
neither
money
nor
pains
to
get
information
as
time
flew
on
it
became
known
that
some
europeans
were
in
confinement
and
philip
had
dispatched
one
or
two
trusty
emissaries
to
endeavour
to
discover
herbert
all
had
however
ended
in
disappointment
and
he
was
baffled
in
every
inquiry
he
did
not
assert
to
herbert
s
family
that
he
lived
but
from
time
to
time
he
renewed
the
supposition
after
the
lapse
of
nearly
four
years
they
heard
from
him
that
he
was
about
to
return
home
on
leave
and
that
he
would
take
the
earliest
opportunity
of
visiting
the
rectory
his
coming
was
earnestly
and
impatiently
expected
for
many
months
for
how
much
should
they
not
have
to
hear
of
their
herbert
from
his
most
devoted
friend
how
many
particulars
of
their
short
service
together
and
its
fatal
result
which
though
the
themes
of
many
letters
were
incomplete
in
comparison
with
what
they
should
hear
from
him
in
person
at
length
his
arrival
in
england
was
announced
by
him
and
though
he
could
not
say
when
he
should
be
at
liberty
he
declared
it
would
not
be
long
ere
he
performed
his
promise
philip
had
thought
it
better
thus
to
leave
them
in
uncertainty
lest
having
their
attention
fixed
upon
any
particular
day
the
contemplation
of
the
excitement
which
would
necessarily
follow
would
be
more
than
the
female
part
of
the
families
could
endure
but
he
did
not
he
could
not
delay
long
he
was
impatient
to
communicate
his
suspicions
his
hopes
that
herbert
existed
which
every
day
s
experience
and
reflection
told
him
were
reasonable
and
hardly
a
fortnight
had
elapsed
ere
he
took
the
mail
to
the
town
of
where
the
regiment
had
been
quartered
and
where
he
had
now
a
friend
leaving
his
portmanteau
at
the
barracks
he
took
with
him
a
change
of
linen
and
late
in
the
afternoon
rode
his
friend
s
horse
over
to
the
rectory
it
was
a
lovely
autumn
evening
the
twilight
had
begun
to
deepen
the
shadows
of
the
luxuriant
woods
of
the
park
and
the
rectory
groves
appeared
dark
and
solemn
at
that
hour
a
few
leaves
had
already
fallen
upon
the
smooth
and
beautifully
kept
entrance
avenue
which
passed
under
some
huge
elms
on
whose
tops
the
noisy
rooks
still
sat
cawing
or
rising
suddenly
with
eccentric
and
rapid
flights
large
bodies
of
the
colony
sailed
through
the
air
alighting
only
to
dispossess
others
of
a
more
favoured
place
or
one
more
coveted
beyond
a
turning
in
the
avenue
the
house
opened
upon
his
old
edifice
of
red
brick
of
the
age
of
elizabeth
the
large
oblong
windows
of
the
with
their
diamond
panes
were
a
blaze
of
light
and
even
as
he
rode
along
he
could
distinguish
the
forms
of
many
within
and
the
cheerful
notes
of
music
came
to
him
through
the
open
casement
a
pale
elderly
lady
lay
on
the
sofa
felt
sure
it
was
herbert
s
mother
there
were
several
standing
round
a
pianoforte
he
listened
for
a
while
with
deep
pleasure
as
the
sounds
of
music
now
rose
now
fell
upon
the
evening
air
and
affected
him
the
more
powerfully
as
the
air
was
one
he
well
remembered
herbert
to
have
often
sung
and
now
the
place
he
had
occupied
there
was
vacant
perhaps
for
ever
as
he
listened
the
voice
of
a
female
arose
in
a
solo
part
so
liquid
so
melodious
so
exquisitely
modulated
that
he
drew
closer
to
hear
it
better
could
it
be
that
of
amy
he
thought
or
one
of
herbert
s
sisters
of
whom
he
had
heard
him
speak
so
often
that
he
fancied
he
almost
knew
them
perhaps
his
favourite
but
it
was
useless
to
should
soon
know
all
the
solo
ceased
again
arose
a
full
swell
of
voices
attuned
by
constant
practice
and
assisted
by
the
instrument
and
a
bass
violin
which
was
played
by
an
elderly
gentleman
it
lasted
for
a
while
then
ceased
party
broke
up
cheerfully
and
the
sound
of
their
merry
voices
caught
his
change
perhaps
an
abrupt
one
from
the
melody
he
had
heard
which
he
would
have
wished
had
been
followed
by
silence
for
his
feelings
were
mournful
and
the
image
of
his
lost
friend
was
painfully
vivid
to
his
imagination
they
might
have
arrived
together
he
thought
again
he
cast
his
eyes
around
him
the
house
with
its
deeply
embayed
windows
and
quaint
projections
was
covered
with
roses
and
creepers
which
entwined
thickly
around
the
beside
there
were
a
and
a
large
which
were
trained
over
the
wall
and
almost
hid
it
with
their
luxuriant
foliage
showing
here
and
there
the
large
black
crossbeams
which
appeared
through
the
masonry
of
the
wall
and
added
to
its
venerable
appearance
before
the
house
there
was
a
which
bloomed
with
a
profusion
of
flowers
whose
rich
perfume
arose
in
the
evening
air
on
one
side
a
long
conservatory
and
beyond
it
a
thick
and
closely
kept
hedge
that
partly
screened
a
wall
which
led
to
other
gardens
on
the
other
side
was
a
lawn
close
and
which
stretched
a
short
distance
to
a
sunken
fence
beyond
which
was
a
field
with
a
few
single
trees
and
the
deep
woods
of
the
park
made
up
the
distance
the
was
low
and
deeply
screened
by
a
porch
around
which
roses
and
clematis
flourished
in
luxuriance
dismounting
from
his
horse
he
rang
the
bell
which
was
quickly
answered
and
desiring
the
servant
to
inform
compton
that
a
gentleman
wished
to
speak
to
him
he
remained
in
the
porch
who
can
it
be
said
some
as
the
servant
announced
the
message
in
another
instant
it
had
flashed
into
the
minds
of
all
that
it
might
be
captain
dalton
and
with
him
came
the
memory
of
poor
herbert
now
to
be
so
freely
awakened
if
it
should
be
he
maria
said
compton
to
his
lady
who
at
the
announcement
had
risen
from
the
sofa
can
you
bear
to
see
him
yes
with
you
only
go
into
the
my
children
we
will
call
you
after
a
they
obeyed
instantly
and
compton
hurried
into
the
hall
to
receive
the
stranger
while
his
lady
prayed
fervently
for
support
in
the
coming
interview
for
she
trembled
exceedingly
and
her
conflicting
emotions
almost
overpowered
her
the
servant
was
holding
philip
s
horse
and
he
himself
was
pacing
slowly
up
and
down
the
narrow
porch
as
compton
advanced
philip
turned
to
meet
him
and
his
first
glance
assured
him
that
the
friend
of
his
lost
son
was
before
him
you
need
not
mention
your
name
my
dear
sir
said
the
old
gentleman
as
he
clasped
his
hand
most
warmly
and
affectionately
in
his
own
while
his
trembling
voice
showed
how
deeply
he
was
agitated
i
am
convinced
that
i
now
welcome
our
and
already
very
dear
captain
dalton
we
have
been
long
expecting
you
and
i
need
hardly
say
how
anxiously
we
have
looked
for
the
arrival
of
one
who
was
so
dear
and
he
hesitated
for
an
instant
but
mastering
his
emotion
he
to
our
poor
herbert
from
whom
we
heard
so
much
of
you
god
bless
you
sir
that
you
have
come
to
us
so
soon
when
you
must
have
had
so
many
claims
upon
you
from
your
own
i
thank
you
sir
heartily
for
this
warm
welcome
said
philip
but
before
i
proceed
further
tell
me
candidly
whether
compton
is
able
to
see
me
that
i
have
seen
you
will
be
a
comfort
to
me
and
for
the
present
i
will
leave
you
and
give
her
time
for
any
preparation
she
may
wish
to
by
no
means
she
is
already
aware
that
this
visit
could
be
from
no
other
but
yourself
and
she
will
be
better
when
she
has
seen
you
you
must
make
some
allowances
for
a
mother
s
fond
mother
s
i
know
all
sir
said
philip
pressing
his
hand
and
miss
hayward
she
is
fortunately
not
with
us
replied
compton
and
we
will
speak
upon
the
subject
with
her
parents
before
we
tell
her
that
you
are
they
were
at
the
door
and
philip
s
heart
beat
faster
than
he
had
ever
remembered
it
to
beat
before
the
suspense
and
anxiety
he
was
in
as
to
the
issue
of
his
meeting
with
compton
almost
overcame
his
habitual
and
he
would
have
given
worlds
could
he
have
ensured
her
equanimity
which
was
little
to
be
expected
she
too
was
not
less
excited
and
a
feeling
of
faintness
came
over
her
as
she
heard
the
hand
of
her
husband
upon
the
lock
she
made
a
strong
effort
however
to
repel
it
and
the
next
moment
he
and
dalton
were
before
her
this
is
captain
dalton
maria
were
all
the
words
compton
had
time
to
utter
ere
his
lady
advanced
to
meet
him
it
needed
not
his
words
to
assure
her
that
the
tall
manly
and
figure
of
the
young
man
was
philip
and
as
she
eagerly
took
his
proffered
hand
while
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
she
in
vain
strove
to
speak
she
read
in
the
expression
of
his
fine
features
as
she
looked
into
his
face
that
her
own
grief
was
reciprocated
and
she
could
no
longer
restrain
the
utterance
of
her
feelings
nor
the
impulse
of
her
affectionate
heart
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
as
she
would
have
done
into
her
own
son
s
and
wept
the
tears
and
bitter
sobs
of
a
mother
s
grief
could
not
be
restrained
and
she
yielded
to
them
freely
for
a
while
his
reserved
demeanour
under
which
was
concealed
as
kind
a
heart
as
ever
beat
struggled
with
his
awakened
sensibilities
but
nature
asserted
her
power
philip
s
tears
mingled
with
hers
and
she
could
feel
them
falling
fast
upon
her
cheek
though
silently
as
he
bent
over
and
supported
her
compton
did
not
interrupt
them
he
was
too
glad
to
see
her
emotion
find
so
natural
and
easy
a
vent
for
he
had
anticipated
a
much
more
violent
effect
compton
soon
rallied
you
will
forgive
this
welcome
of
one
who
is
so
dear
to
us
captain
dalton
she
said
speaking
with
difficulty
but
you
know
that
with
you
are
associated
many
many
painful
recollections
bear
with
me
shall
be
calm
soon
i
feel
that
my
heart
has
already
been
relieved
and
is
philip
could
not
then
say
much
in
reply
but
soon
their
conversation
flowed
more
naturally
and
calmly
and
ere
long
the
rest
of
the
family
were
admitted
and
he
was
introduced
and
received
as
a
brother
among
them
gradually
their
conversation
turned
upon
him
they
thought
dead
philip
had
to
answer
a
thousand
questions
and
to
give
the
minutest
particulars
to
the
eager
and
loving
inquirers
and
though
the
tears
of
all
flowed
silently
and
fast
even
as
they
spoke
yet
compton
felt
when
she
retired
to
rest
at
a
late
hour
as
if
some
portion
of
the
load
which
had
oppressed
her
had
been
removed
and
she
fervently
blessed
god
who
had
sent
her
such
a
friend
and
comforter
chapter
xxvi
the
first
constraint
of
ceremony
having
been
broken
and
the
subject
so
near
to
the
hearts
of
all
touched
upon
even
on
the
first
night
of
their
acquaintance
as
every
succeeding
day
passed
they
became
more
attached
to
each

to
one
they
looked
upon
and
loved
as
a
children
to
their
poor
brother
s
friend
and
dearest
companion
day
by
day
the
subject
of
poor
herbert
s
fate
was
the
theme
of
conversation
they
were
never
weary
of
it
and
philip
unfolded
to
them
gently
but
unreservedly
his
convictions
that
herbert
still
perhaps
in
some
lonely
away
from
the
capital
of
mysore
or
engaged
in
the
hated
service
of
the
ruler
of
the
country
for
many
others
were
known
to
have
submitted
to
tippoo
s
will
in
this
respect
in
the
hope
that
some
opportunity
would
be
afforded
for
escape
or
some
action
with
their
countrymen
would
facilitate
their
desertion
poor
amy
the
bitterest
trial
she
had
endured
since
the
news
of
herbert
s
captivity
and
next
to
his
supposed
death
was
the
meeting
with
philip
and
receiving
from
his
own
hands
the
little
packet
which
herbert
had
entrusted
to
him
in
case
of
his
death
and
which
he
had
retained
for
many
days
she
could
not
see
him
but
at
length
she
fixed
a
day
and
hour
and
he
walked
over
to
beechwood
he
had
not
seen
her
except
at
church
where
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
graceful
figure
dressed
in
simple
mourning
this
only
excited
his
curiosity
to
know
more
of
one
whom
his
poor
friend
had
loved
with
such
intensity
of
love
so
faithfully
reciprocated
hayward
received
the
young
soldier
and
in
a
short
conversation
with
him
justly
estimated
the
strength
and
delicacy
of
his
feelings
it
was
impossible
for
any
one
to
have
been
more
deeply
aware
of
the
difficult
part
he
had
to
perform
nor
to
have
evinced
more
tenderness
in
the
manner
in
which
he
executed
it
i
would
not
have
pressed
miss
hayward
upon
the
subject
he
said
i
would
not
willingly
distress
her
nor
excite
thoughts
which
must
violently
affect
her
but
i
made
a
promise
solemnly
to
herbert
and
i
have
come
to
fulfil
it
and
it
will
be
a
gratification
to
me
if
i
am
allowed
to
do
so
still
if
she
declines
an
interview
with
me
i
would
leave
the
packet
with
you
that
it
will
be
in
safe
hands
and
it
can
be
delivered
or
not
to
miss
hayward
as
you
if
you
will
remain
here
captain
dalton
i
will
see
amy
and
state
what
you
say
to
her
replied
the
old
lady
but
i
can
promise
nothing
she
is
usually
calm
and
but
your
coming
may
have
such
an
effect
upon
her
as
to
unfit
her
for
receiving
you
you
shall
however
soon
know
the
and
so
saying
she
left
the
room
philip
looked
around
there
were
books
italian
and
spanish
poets
open
upon
the
table
with
some
beautiful
embroidery
which
showed
that
amy
must
have
been
there
when
he
was
announced
on
a
side
table
was
an
unfinished
large
tree
a
few
sheep
and
a
mossy
bank
beautifully
painted
and
the
colours
and
water
which
stood
near
it
proved
that
she
had
lately
been
engaged
upon
it
philip
went
to
examine
it
and
while
admiring
the
freedom
and
vigour
of
the
drawing
and
the
keen
perception
of
nature
evident
in
the
colouring
the
door
gently
opened
and
a
lady
entered
whose
appearance
caused
in
his
heart
a
thrill
of
excitement
and
a
confusion
in
his
address
which
he
had
little
expected
miss
hayward
i
presume
he
said
advancing
to
her
with
hesitation
for
her
beauty
the
sweet
expression
of
her
face
and
her
mild
blue
eyes
fixed
his
attention
and
rendered
his
manner
involuntarily
constrained
amy
could
not
reply
her
heart
was
full
even
to
choking
she
had
in
vain
tried
to
compose
herself
when
his
name
was
announced
but
unable
to
do
so
she
had
left
the
room
and
it
was
only
on
hearing
the
message
her
mother
had
delivered
that
she
determined
to
see
the
friend
of
her
herbert
to
speak
to
him
who
had
received
his
last
message
for
her
and
she
came
down
alone
to
meet
him
she
had
however
taxed
her
powers
of
endurance
to
the
utmost
the
sight
of
the
tall
and
manly
figure
of
philip
his
dark
and
expressive
somewhat
by
an
eastern
sun
yet
preserving
the
ruddy
glow
of
form
and
caused
at
first
a
rush
of
remembrances
almost
too
powerful
to
endure
and
her
imagination
despite
of
her
efforts
not
to
yield
to
such
thoughts
could
not
help
picturing
to
herself
how
herbert
would
have
been
he
would
have
looked
how
he
would
have
met
her
after
their
long
absence
she
could
not
speak
to
dalton
but
trembled
exceedingly
and
would
have
fallen
but
seeing
her
agitation
he
assisted
her
to
a
seat
she
sank
into
it
and
unable
to
speak
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
philip
sat
silent
for
a
while
but
he
saw
that
further
delay
would
only
be
a
protraction
of
her
misery
miss
hayward
he
said
very
respectfully
i
am
the
bearer
of
a
small
packet
for
you
which
i
promised
to
deliver
if
you
will
receive
it
from
my
hands
i
shall
be
gratified
as
you
will
have
enabled
me
to
fulfil
a
promise
i
have
looked
on
as
again
amy
endeavoured
to
reply
but
her
words
failed
her
and
her
hand
trembled
so
much
as
she
stretched
it
out
to
him
that
he
feared
the
consequences
of
her
emotion
i
implore
you
to
be
calm
miss
hayward
shall
i
ring
for
your
mother
can
i
do
aught
to
assist
you
he
continued
as
he
gave
her
the
little
packet
which
she
received
with
extreme
agitation
and
not
daring
to
look
at
him
no
i
thank
you
captain
dalton
she
said
at
length
after
a
severe
effort
to
repress
her
feelings
in
which
she
partly
succeeded
i
am
better
now
and
will
hear
whatever
you
have
to
will
be
better
than
to
but
philip
feared
the
result
and
urged
that
her
mother
at
least
should
be
present
no
she
replied
it
is
better
thus
with
her
i
should
fail
alone
i
think
i
can
be
firm
therefore
and
he
obeyed
her
he
told
her
of
their
last
the
events
of
the
war
and
when
she
appeared
to
listen
calmly
he
mentioned
their
last
few
days
intercourse
their
last
interview
their
farewell
and
their
mutual
promises
in
case
of
the
death
of
either
there
was
no
message
in
particular
to
packet
would
explain
all
he
said
he
had
been
desired
to
mention
to
her
the
events
that
had
occurred
before
he
received
it
and
he
was
thankful
he
had
been
spared
to
deliver
the
message
himself
amy
listened
patiently
and
grew
calmer
as
he
proceeded
he
could
not
see
her
features
for
her
hand
covered
them
as
she
leaned
back
but
at
length
before
he
ceased
he
could
perceive
that
his
simple
narrative
had
soothed
her
for
a
silent
tear
forced
its
way
between
her
slender
fingers
and
trickled
over
her
fair
hand
she
appeared
not
to
be
aware
of
it
and
others
followed
rapidly
nature
had
yielded
her
most
gentle
remedy
for
a
troubled
tears
which
flow
without
pain
or
sobbings
he
did
not
disturb
her
thoughts
which
appeared
entirely
to
absorb
her
and
he
fancied
that
she
prayed
mentally
for
her
lips
moved
he
arose
and
stealing
to
the
door
opened
it
very
gently
and
quitted
the
apartment
it
was
enough
that
he
had
seen
and
spoken
to
her
compton
stood
without
anxiously
awaiting
the
issue
should
there
have
been
occasion
for
her
aid
he
told
her
how
touchingly
how
beautifully
she
had
heard
him
and
the
mother
was
glad
that
dalton
had
seen
her
that
the
crisis
had
passed
so
calmly
she
will
be
better
for
this
hereafter
she
said
and
judged
rightly
amy
was
more
cheerful
and
more
equably
so
from
that
day
hayward
accompanied
philip
to
her
husband
s
study
to
bear
him
the
happy
tidings
that
had
so
rejoiced
her
and
here
they
long
and
earnestly
talked
over
philip
s
hopes
his
almost
certainty
that
herbert
lived
there
was
much
which
appeared
to
both
and
hayward
improbable
in
what
he
that
they
could
not
understand
from
their
ignorance
of
the
habits
of
the
natives
and
of
their
highly
civilised
and
cultivated
character
in
the
end
however
they
could
not
but
encourage
the
glimmering
of
hope
which
had
entered
their
it
is
true
by
doubts
and
fears
but
still
abiding
there
it
would
have
been
cruel
however
to
have
mentioned
this
to
amy
and
for
the
present
she
was
ignorant
of
it
amy
sat
long
so
absorbed
in
thought
that
she
had
not
noticed
the
departure
of
philip
dalton
and
when
she
spoke
not
daring
to
withdraw
her
hands
from
her
eyes
and
received
no
answer
she
looked
around
and
saw
that
she
was
alone
then
she
thanked
philip
in
her
heart
for
his
tender
consideration
of
her
and
long
remembered
the
act
simple
as
it
was
with
gratitude
she
held
the
packet
she
had
received
and
once
more
dared
to
look
on
the
handwriting
she
knew
that
it
could
be
of
no
later
date
than
the
letters
she
had
already
in
her
possession
but
it
was
not
opened
it
was
to
be
given
her
only
in
case
of
his
death
and
her
mind
was
oppressed
with
feelings
of
awe
as
she
almost
hesitated
to
break
the
seal
and
peruse
its
contents
it
is
a
period
for
solemn
thought
when
we
open
a
letter
from
one
known
to
be
think
that
the
hand
which
traced
the
characters
is
cold
and
powerless
that
the
mind
whose
thoughts
are
there
recorded
is
no
longer
constituted
as
ours
this
carries
us
involuntarily
into
a
deep
train
of
thought
and
speculation
vague
and
to
no
end
but
a
vain
striving
for
knowledge
of
what
is
better
hidden
in
futurity
or
if
the
writing
be
that
of
one
dear
or
familiar
to
us
how
many
reminiscences
crowd
instantly
into
the
mind
tokens
of
affection
in
which
nature
is
prolific
soothing
the
thoughts
of
the
survivor
while
they
hallow
the
memory
of
the
dead
amy
s
packet
was
precious
indeed
herbert
had
written
to
her
gravely
and
thoughtfully
yet
here
and
there
with
passionate
love
as
though
he
had
at
times
failed
in
checking
the
expression
of
feelings
to
which
when
she
received
the
letter
he
could
no
longer
respond
he
had
enclosed
a
little
locket
which
contained
his
hair
and
implored
her
with
an
earnestness
which
his
strong
sense
of
honour
prompted
but
which
cost
him
pain
to
write
and
her
to
peruse
while
she
honoured
his
memory
in
death
not
to
refuse
that
station
in
life
to
which
she
would
be
solicited
by
many
she
appreciated
these
expressions
with
a
just
sense
of
the
feelings
under
which
he
had
written
them
but
while
she
read
them
she
more
strongly
than
ever
clung
to
his
memory
with
grateful
and
devoted
yet
mournful
affection
and
could
philip
have
seen
her
as
she
rose
from
the
perusal
of
that
letter
with
eyes
dim
and
glistening
with
tears
and
advancing
to
the
window
look
forth
in
her
calm
and
gentle
beauty
over
the
broad
and
glowing
might
have
worshipped
her
in
his
heart
as
a
personification
of
one
of
those
pure
beings
who
do
service
in
heaven
and
who
touched
with
our
infirmities
can
be
supposed
to
feel
in
some
degree
the
sorrows
of
an
earthly
existence
from
that
day
forth
there
was
no
reserve
on
philip
s
part
towards
the
beechwood
family
with
whom
he
was
ever
a
welcome
and
a
guest
his
own
affairs
and
a
visit
to
his
elder
brother
for
his
mother
his
only
surviving
parent
had
died
while
he
was
in
india
occupied
him
for
a
month
after
his
departure
from
the
rectory
and
when
this
period
had
arrived
he
was
only
too
glad
to
avail
himself
of
the
pressing
invitations
of
both
families
to
return
and
spend
some
time
alternately
with
them
the
young
haywards
too
had
returned
home
the
one
from
scotland
where
he
had
been
on
a
visit
the
other
from
oxford
where
he
was
studying
for
a
degree
chapter
xxvii
in
this
delightful
society
philip
s
time
flew
rapidly
and
happily
he
was
fond
of
the
chase
and
of
shooting
and
in
the
noble
stud
of
beechwood
and
over
its
broad
manors
and
preserves
there
were
ample
resources
for
both
pursuits
and
the
young
men
became
intimate
and
inseparable
companions
among
themselves
they
often
talked
of
herbert
as
of
a
departed
brother
and
philip
at
length
unreservedly
opened
his
heart
to
them
on
the
subject
which
except
one
of
later
growth
was
nearest
to
it
our
hearts
often
take
strong
impressions
from
the
veriest
trifles
much
more
when
they
are
assisted
or
coloured
by
adventitious
circumstances
as
philip
listened
to
the
sweet
voice
he
had
heard
singing
as
he
rode
up
to
the
rectory
on
the
evening
he
first
arrived
there
his
sensibilities
had
been
powerfully
excited
towards
the
songstress
either
because
she
might
be
the
affianced
or
the
sister
of
his
friend
he
had
been
introduced
to
all
the
family
in
succession
on
that
evening
and
he
was
at
once
struck
with
the
beauty
of
one
of
the
young
ladies
and
her
great
likeness
to
his
friend
she
had
the
same
large
and
expressive
blue
eye
regular
features
and
brown
hair
falling
upon
her
shoulders
in
luxuriant
curling
tresses
she
was
taller
in
proportion
than
he
was
but
her
figure
was
remarkable
for
its
grace
and
beauty
of
contour
he
then
hoped
she
might
be
the
songstress
why
he
could
hardly
have
told
he
heard
her
repeat
the
air
to
which
he
had
first
listened
for
it
was
often
afterwards
sung
by
the
small
but
band
and
distinguished
by
the
name
of
captain
dalton
s
favourite
night
after
night
did
philip
sit
listening
with
increasing
delight
to
ellen
s
rich
voice
as
she
sang
either
alone
or
in
parts
indeed
she
was
a
thorough
mistress
of
the
art
in
which
she
had
from
the
first
been
well
grounded
and
her
execution
evinced
a
pure
taste
which
entering
into
the
spirit
of
the
composer
sought
rather
to
draw
gratification
from
giving
expression
to
his
thoughts
than
to
indulge
in
the
poor
vanity
of
exhibiting
her
own
powers
she
was
by
no
means
insensible
to
the
marked
pleasure
which
her
singing
gave
to
the
young
soldier
and
from
this
commencement
there
gradually
sprang
up
a
warm
and
increasing
attachment
which
her
parents
observed
with
sincere
pleasure
philip
found
on
a
further
knowledge
of
her
character
that
she
possessed
many
tastes
and
feelings
in
common
with
his
own
and
he
observed
with
delight
her
extensive
charity
her
visits
with
amy
to
the
sick
and
poor
of
the
neighbourhood
and
their
close
and
affectionate
friendship
somehow
or
other
he
oftener
spoke
to
her
than
to
the
rest
and
she
listened
so
he
thought
with
more
interest
than
the
others
to
his
tales
of
foreign
climes
and
hard
service
he
oftener
found
something
to
do
for
her
oftener
walked
with
her
or
escorted
her
and
amy
upon
their
charitable
visits
a
thousand
kindnesses
passed
between
them
which
in
others
would
have
been
forgotten
but
with
them
were
treasured
up
and
remembered
vividly
when
they
were
separated
we
do
not
intend
to
be
the
chroniclers
of
this
tale
of
mutual
attachment
which
steadily
increased
there
was
no
opposition
from
her
parents
but
on
the
contrary
the
utmost
desire
that
it
should
progress
steadily
and
in
the
end
successful
philip
waited
however
until
he
had
known
her
for
nearly
a
year
and
when
he
felt
sure
that
his
offer
would
be
accepted
he
made
it
and
was
rewarded
the
gentle
and
lovely
girl
had
long
been
his
and
she
now
gave
herself
up
to
the
ardent
feelings
of
her
loving
heart
they
were
married
early
in
the
spring
of
the
year
succeeding
the
one
in
which
philip
had
arrived
the
joyous
bridal
took
one
of
those
bright
and
sunny
days
when
hardly
a
cloud
dims
the
serenity
of
the
sky
when
the
buds
are
just
bursting
into
life
and
nature
having
rested
through
the
winter
is
about
to
resume
her
robe
of
luxuriant
foliage
ere
she
rejoices
in
the
genial
sun
and
the
warm
winds
of
summer
amy
consented
with
much
fear
and
many
doubts
of
her
ability
to
go
through
her
simple
duties
as
one
of
the
bride
and
she
appeared
that
day
in
more
than
her
usual
beauty
having
thrown
off
her
garb
of
mourning
ellen
s
sisters
and
philip
s
only
one
were
the
others
and
as
the
joyous
procession
wound
down
the
broad
aisle
of
the
old
church
and
the
light
streaming
through
the
painted
windows
rested
upon
the
group
collected
around
the
altar
assuredly
on
a
gayer
bridal
party
or
one
whose
hearts
were
more
linked
together
by
affection
the
bright
and
glowing
sun
never
shone
nevertheless
there
were
a
few
among
them
on
whom
the
hand
of
sorrow
had
lain
heavily
and
who
if
they
did
not
join
in
the
exuberant
joy
of
the
rest
were
as
sincere
and
as
fervent
in
their
prayers
and
wishes
for
the
happiness
of
those
who
plighted
their
vows
in
their
presence
some
a
and
what
philip
had
wished
so
much
the
purchase
of
a
majority
in
a
regiment
then
in
india
was
at
last
within
his
attainment
for
he
had
not
concealed
from
compton
nor
from
his
wife
that
he
still
looked
to
that
land
for
distinction
and
advancement
in
his
profession
and
also
for
the
chance
of
sooner
or
later
discovering
a
clue
to
the
fate
of
him
whom
all
still
mourned
the
handsome
portion
which
he
had
received
with
ellen
had
enabled
him
to
meet
the
outlay
for
this
advancement
with
perfect
convenience
and
in
a
short
time
he
was
gazetted
as
major
in
the
then
serving
in
the
madras
presidency
and
being
anxious
to
join
his
regiment
he
prepared
without
delay
this
was
however
productive
of
another
incident
in
the
family
circle
of
beechwood
in
the
mind
of
the
youngest
of
amy
s
brothers
philip
s
wild
tales
of
battles
of
marches
of
the
gorgeous
country
and
its
curious
and
interesting
their
ceremonies
and
their
various
tiger
and
excited
a
restless
curiosity
to
behold
them
and
to
become
an
actor
in
the
stirring
scenes
which
were
every
day
taking
place
but
when
philip
spoke
of
herbert
and
of
his
own
hope
that
he
would
be
eventually
recovered
charles
hayward
s
enthusiasm
was
warmed
by
his
affection
and
his
waking
thoughts
and
dreams
were
alike
incessantly
occupied
with
speculations
upon
the
subject
which
unfitted
him
for
study
and
rendered
him
restless
and
uneasy
long
before
philip
had
declared
his
intention
of
returning
to
india
charles
had
determined
upon
requesting
his
father
s
permission
to
enter
the
army
in
a
regiment
serving
as
near
the
scene
of
herbert
s
disappearance
as
possible
charles
too
loved
his
sister
with
an
intensity
which
would
have
urged
him
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
her
sake
and
it
was
anguish
to
him
to
see
her
bowed
down
by
mental
suffering
and
clinging
with
fond
tenacity
to
the
memory
of
the
dead
when
his
own
exertions
guided
by
the
experience
of
their
friend
dalton
might
under
the
aid
of
providence
be
instrumental
in
restoring
her
to
her
usual
health
and
joyous
spirits
it
was
true
she
had
expressed
no
thought
or
hope
of
herbert
s
existence
to
any
of
them
and
the
youth
as
he
roamed
with
her
through
the
park
or
sat
with
her
in
her
own
little
study
where
she
was
surrounded
by
precious
memorials
of
herbert
often
longed
to
tell
her
of
philip
s
suspicions
and
his
own
wild
yearnings
towards
that
distant
land
had
he
done
so
there
is
little
doubt
that
she
would
have
disclosed
to
him
sooner
than
she
did
the
hope
she
secretly
cherished
that
herbert
still
existed
and
would
return
no
sooner
had
philip
openly
declared
his
intention
of
revisiting
india
than
charles
determination
was
formed
to
break
the
matter
at
once
to
his
father
and
to
proceed
with
philip
should
no
opposition
be
objections
he
certainly
anticipated
but
he
thought
he
could
overcome
them
before
he
broached
the
subject
to
his
parents
he
held
a
long
and
anxious
conversation
with
philip
and
was
delighted
to
find
that
he
not
only
coincided
in
his
views
but
was
prepared
to
aid
them
by
his
interest
in
the
purchase
of
an
ensigncy
in
the
regiment
to
which
he
now
belonged
in
which
there
was
a
vacant
commission
his
proposal
as
he
had
anticipated
was
met
by
many
objections
and
much
distress
on
the
part
of
his
parents
and
sister
loving
him
tenderly
as
she
did
amy
could
not
bear
the
thought
which
at
first
obtruded
upon
her
that
india
would
be
his
grave
as
it
had
been
that
of
herbert
but
the
young
man
was
resolute
and
after
exhausting
all
his
arguments
he
called
philip
dalton
to
his
aid
who
not
only
promised
to
be
a
guardian
to
him
but
declared
he
would
let
slip
no
opportunity
of
bettering
his
station
and
prospects
in
his
profession
all
opposition
therefore
ceased
gradually
partly
because
charles
appeared
to
relish
the
prospects
of
a
military
life
more
than
any
other
and
partly
because
there
appeared
a
likelihood
of
rapid
advancement
in
the
regiment
while
it
remained
on
its
eastern
service
the
day
at
last
arrived
when
he
was
to
leave
home
for
his
long
absence
to
all
it
was
a
source
of
bitter
grief
but
the
most
so
to
his
mother
and
to
amy
and
ere
the
hour
came
when
he
was
to
depart
from
them
amy
led
him
away
from
the
house
and
wandering
together
they
talked
over
the
him
bright
with
contrast
and
a
sad
one
to
hers
which
was
so
overcast
they
wandered
on
through
the
parks
and
by
the
stream
where
years
before
she
had
roamed
with
herbert
charles
knew
that
she
must
be
thinking
of
him
whose
fate
was
wrapt
in
mystery
and
he
longed
to
know
and
to
share
all
her
thoughts
and
feelings
on
the
subject
gradually
he
led
her
to
speak
of
herbert
and
as
their
conversation
warmed
the
devoted
girl
could
no
longer
refrain
from
unburdening
her
heart
and
confessing
the
hopes
which
only
her
god
to
whom
she
addressed
them
night
and
morning
in
fervent
prayer
knew
to
exist
still
however
charles
was
sorely
perplexed
and
his
judgment
and
affection
were
at
variance
but
the
latter
prevailed
under
her
artless
confidence
and
he
told
her
in
hesitation
and
fear
of
philip
dalton
s
hopes
of
the
chances
of
herbert
s
life
spoke
to
her
of
the
folly
of
cherishing
hope
only
because
they
had
not
heard
he
was
dead
but
nevertheless
declared
how
this
had
preyed
on
his
mind
till
it
almost
amounted
to
an
earnest
of
success
she
listened
with
breathless
interest
to
his
was
too
much
in
accordance
with
her
own
thoughts
to
be
slighted
she
did
not
blame
her
brother
that
he
had
kept
it
from
her
and
she
could
not
have
borne
it
from
dalton
now
she
believed
rashly
her
mind
was
strong
and
tempered
by
affliction
but
there
was
more
room
for
hope
than
ever
and
she
felt
as
though
the
hand
of
providence
was
discernible
in
the
matter
guiding
her
brother
onward
in
the
track
of
her
lost
herbert
now
that
their
most
secret
thoughts
were
in
common
she
felt
that
she
could
part
with
charles
more
easily
and
he
left
her
at
last
in
their
little
where
she
loved
to
sit
and
where
they
had
been
yet
with
hope
in
her
heart
his
mother
bade
him
farewell
with
many
tears
and
many
prayers
for
his
safety
and
accompanied
by
his
father
and
his
elder
brother
charles
was
rapidly
whirled
away
from
his
home
to
enter
upon
the
life
of
danger
and
adventure
he
had
chosen
for
himself
in
another
week
he
with
philip
dalton
and
his
wife
had
left
their
native
shores
for
a
long
and
perhaps
perilous
absence
six
months
had
now
passed
at
seringapatam
during
much
of
which
time
kasim
ali
had
been
absent
on
the
various
duties
connected
with
his
new
situation
he
had
risen
in
rank
and
from
the
steadiness
of
his
conduct
the
khan
would
have
been
glad
to
have
kept
kasim
always
with
him
but
this
was
impossible
for
the
sultaun
s
eye
was
upon
him
although
remembering
the
scene
in
the
durbar
he
had
wished
to
see
little
of
one
who
had
behaved
so
boldly
before
him
yet
whom
he
respected
from
the
lucky
appearances
he
believed
kasim
to
possess
and
which
he
had
given
himself
credit
for
having
discovered
he
would
often
say
to
his
favourite
syud
sahib
that
he
was
sure
kasim
ali
notwithstanding
he
was
in
disgrace
would
be
of
service
to
him
in
the
end
and
that
it
was
better
he
should
be
checked
at
first
and
thus
inspired
with
a
thirst
for
distinguishing
himself
than
spoiled
by
too
early
notice
or
promotion
but
he
had
nevertheless
given
a
strong
proof
of
his
reliance
on
the
young
man
s
ability
and
courage
hardly
a
month
had
passed
after
his
disgrace
and
kasim
was
fast
sinking
into
a
state
of
apathy
at
his
dim
prospects
which
at
first
were
so
brilliant
when
the
sultaun
entrusted
him
with
a
mission
requiring
much
delicacy
and
tact
in
its
execution
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
khan
had
stated
in
the
durbar
that
he
had
heard
of
an
embassy
to
seringapatam
being
meditated
at
the
nizam
s
court
and
this
tippoo
so
earnestly
desired
that
his
restless
mind
was
in
a
constant
state
of
irritation
upon
the
subject
could
he
only
detach
the
nizam
from
the
alliance
of
the
hated
the
afghan
monarch
only
see
the
two
great
mahomedan
powers
of
the
south
united
in
a
close
would
pour
his
hardy
followers
upon
their
northern
might
be
a
second
battle
of
paniput
and
with
such
a
result
what
was
to
prevent
the
northern
army
joining
with
the
nizam
his
falling
in
one
overwhelming
mass
upon
the
english
possessions
driving
the
hated
race
into
the
sea
for
ever
a
month
passed
and
still
no
embassy
arrived
nor
was
there
any
intelligence
of
one
to
gain
news
therefore
of
the
nizam
s
court
he
dispatched
kasim
attended
only
by
a
horseman
or
two
to
travel
by
rapid
marches
to
hyderabad
and
to
discover
as
far
as
lay
in
his
power
the
sentiments
of
the
court
and
the
feeling
of
the
people
kasim
was
gratified
beyond
expression
by
the
selection
of
him
above
others
of
known
sagacity
for
such
a
mission
and
he
determined
to
spare
neither
exertion
nor
zeal
in
his
master
s
cause
in
order
to
regain
his
favour
by
the
most
rapid
marches
he
traversed
the
nearest
road
to
to
the
westward
of
nundidroog
and
resting
only
a
night
at
his
own
humble
but
not
less
dear
home
where
he
found
his
mother
well
and
his
affairs
continuing
prosperous
he
pushed
on
to
hyderabad
where
as
soon
as
he
arrived
he
set
himself
to
work
to
gain
information
for
nearly
three
months
did
he
wait
there
expecting
with
anxiety
the
determination
of
the
vacillating
prince
at
one
time
he
heard
that
an
embassy
would
soon
set
off
and
that
a
nobleman
was
appointed
ambassador
this
was
again
contradicted
and
it
was
rumoured
that
the
nizam
had
entered
into
a
fresh
league
with
the
english
but
in
the
end
there
was
no
doubt
that
an
embassy
would
be
sent
to
try
the
temper
of
the
mysore
chief
and
kasim
hearing
from
undoubted
authority
the
name
of
the
gentleman
who
had
been
nominated
ali
reza
waited
on
him
disclosed
the
subject
of
his
mission
and
having
given
such
an
account
as
he
was
able
of
the
sultaun
s
anxiety
received
in
return
the
purport
of
the
proposed
embassy
which
was
in
effect
what
tippoo
looked
for
having
obtained
this
and
being
assured
by
ali
reza
that
they
should
meet
again
in
a
short
time
kasim
left
hyderabad
and
with
the
same
expedition
returned
to
seringapatam
again
on
his
way
he
stayed
with
his
mother
again
he
visited
the
spot
which
continued
dear
to
him
from
the
memorable
night
s
adventure
trees
were
growing
up
and
the
tomb
of
the
poor
soldier
was
neatly
kept
he
had
to
answer
a
thousand
questions
to
his
mother
respecting
their
journey
and
ameena
of
whom
kasim
could
now
tell
her
nothing
except
that
the
khan
whenever
he
inquired
after
her
health
said
she
was
well
and
happy
chapter
xxviii
the
sultaun
was
delighted
at
the
news
he
received
which
while
it
surpassed
his
expectations
apparently
confirmed
him
in
his
immediate
plans
of
action
as
the
rainy
season
of
closed
large
bodies
of
troops
were
despatched
to
coimbatoor
for
the
purpose
of
prosecuting
the
war
against
the
rebellious
nairs
who
in
the
jungles
and
forests
of
malabar
continued
to
defy
the
governor
s
power
and
the
forces
from
time
to
time
sent
against
them
among
the
latter
was
kasim
soon
after
his
return
from
the
mission
to
hyderabad
from
the
success
of
which
he
had
hoped
to
have
his
place
near
the
sultaun
s
person
but
the
wrong
he
had
done
had
not
been
entirely
forgiven
or
forgotten
nor
was
the
khan
his
companion
he
was
detached
with
the
other
half
of
the
khan
s
risala
which
was
commanded
by
dilawur
ali
an
officer
somewhat
like
the
khan
himself
but
of
hyder
ali
s
earliest
adherents
who
had
been
spared
through
many
a
hard
fight
and
rough
service
to
him
kasim
was
of
the
utmost
use
both
as
an
excellent
secretary
and
an
intelligent
and
upright
adviser
the
sultaun
took
the
field
in
person
against
the
nairs
in
january
of
the
ensuing
year
and
prosecuted
the
war
against
them
with
the
utmost
energy
in
one
fort
alone
two
thousand
of
them
capitulated
who
were
converted
under
the
threat
of
death
if
they
refused
the
rite
of
islam
complying
therefore
they
publicly
ate
of
beef
which
abhorrent
as
it
was
to
them
they
were
obliged
to
partake
of
the
war
prospered
and
ere
the
rains
had
set
in
the
territory
was
subdued
by
the
ravages
of
the
mysore
army
for
the
war
had
been
proclaimed
a
holy
one
by
the
sultaun
who
with
mad
fanaticism
everywhere
destroyed
temples
broke
their
images
and
plundered
their
treasures
those
nairs
who
would
not
accept
the
conversion
offered
were
hunted
like
wild
beasts
and
destroyed
in
thousands
the
army
at
coimbatoor
heard
of
these
events
one
by
one
as
they
happened
and
of
the
marriage
of
the
sultaun
s
son
to
the
beautiful
daughter
of
the
lady
ruler
of
cannanore
and
he
soon
afterwards
arrived
in
triumph
at
coimbatoor
having
left
a
large
detachment
to
complete
the
destruction
of
the
nairs
great
were
the
rejoicings
upon
the
victories
that
had
been
gained
the
army
had
tasted
blood
and
like
their
tiger
leader
thirsted
for
more
here
was
celebrated
the
mohurrum
the
sacred
anniversary
of
the
deaths
of
hassan
and
hoosein
with
all
the
pomp
and
with
all
the
zeal
to
which
an
army
of
fanatical
mahomedans
could
be
excited
by
the
example
of
their
bigoted
sultaun
at
this
time
was
issued
the
proclamation
that
the
kingly
noubut
was
to
be
performed
five
times
on
every
friday
because
that
day
was
the
sabbath
of
the
day
on
which
the
flood
day
on
which
the
heaven
was
created
the
sultaun
and
his
astrologers
observed
the
aspect
of
the
stars
and
in
a
fortunate
hour
when
the
moon
was
in
taurus
mercury
and
venus
in
virgo
the
sun
in
leo
saturn
in
aquarius
and
venus
in
opposition
to
libra
it
was
proclaimed
with
pomp
in
the
mosques
that
the
music
would
be
played
and
royal
state
observed
then
the
deep
tones
of
the
huge
burst
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
sultaun
s
tent
and
the
assembled
army
broke
into
loud
acclamations
and
hoarse
cries
of
deen
deen
the
sultaun
is
the
apostle
the
sultaun
is
the
conqueror
a
few
days
afterwards
the
long
embassy
arrived
from
hyderabad
and
kasim
once
more
welcomed
his
friends
they
were
presented
to
the
sultaun
in
a
full
durbar
of
his
officers
native
and
european
with
all
the
pomp
of
regal
state
they
were
at
once
disgusted
with
the
assumed
consequence
of
one
whose
state
was
less
than
that
of
their
prince
but
they
presented
the
splendid
koran
they
had
been
entrusted
with
upon
which
it
was
said
that
the
nizam
had
sworn
to
aid
tippoo
with
his
whole
army
and
power
against
the
english
the
letters
they
bore
were
cautious
and
dignified
yet
through
the
overwhelming
flow
of
eastern
compliment
could
be
discovered
the
hidden
meaning
which
tippoo
had
so
long
and
so
earnestly
expected
the
ambassadors
were
dismissed
for
the
present
with
honour
and
the
whole
army
rejoiced
that
such
an
alliance
would
be
entered
into
a
long
conference
did
tippoo
hold
that
night
with
the
officers
whom
he
habitually
consulted
upon
the
subject
of
the
embassy
he
had
long
been
solicitous
of
allying
himself
by
marriage
with
the
princely
family
of
the
dekhan
but
had
never
had
an
opportunity
of
proposing
it
now
when
the
nizam
had
sought
humbled
by
the
english
and
in
dread
of
the
mahratta
power
that
prince
had
asked
aid
against
both
from
his
brother
in
the
thought
he
could
make
that
a
condition
of
compliance
it
had
been
his
favourite
project
for
years
and
he
was
now
determined
to
urge
it
it
was
in
vain
that
those
who
wished
his
cause
well
advised
him
bluntly
and
honestly
to
forego
his
request
for
the
present
there
were
others
who
listened
to
his
rhapsodies
about
the
stars
to
the
records
of
his
dreams
until
they
were
carried
on
to
support
the
demand
and
it
was
made
as
proudly
by
the
vain
and
inflated
sultaun
as
his
receipt
of
the
embassy
had
been
ostentatious
and
offensive
but
the
nizam
s
ambassadors
were
men
of
sound
judgment
they
knew
that
their
prince
had
lowered
himself
already
in
sending
the
embassy
to
a
upstart
and
men
of
high
family
themselves
they
could
well
appreciate
the
situation
in
which
he
would
feel
himself
placed
by
the
proposal
they
answered
the
demand
in
cold
and
haughty
terms
and
requesting
their
dismissal
soon
after
left
his
camp
it
was
in
vain
that
the
sultaun
s
best
friends
urged
their
recall
as
of
vital
importance
to
himself
to
the
cause
of
islam
the
ambassadors
were
allowed
to
proceed
on
their
return
to
hyderabad
the
sultaun
s
message
was
received
with
indignation
by
the
nizam
whose
pride
instantly
rose
against
the
degradation
of
the
proposed
matrimonial
connection
an
embassy
from
tippoo
which
followed
was
dismissed
with
a
flat
refusal
and
the
nizam
throwing
himself
now
entirely
into
the
cause
of
the
english
pressed
them
for
the
execution
of
the
treaty
of
which
involved
the
conquest
of
mysore
those
who
were
near
the
sultaun
when
he
received
the
reply
for
he
had
waited
the
issue
of
his
demand
ere
he
commenced
the
operations
he
had
long
ago
determined
upon
saw
how
nearly
the
refusal
had
touched
his
pride
and
expected
some
outbreak
of
violent
passion
but
he
stifled
his
feelings
for
the
time
or
perhaps
in
the
pride
of
possessing
the
fine
army
he
commanded
and
the
slavish
adoration
which
it
paid
him
he
did
not
heed
the
slight
he
was
only
heard
to
say
well
it
is
a
matter
of
no
consequence
we
who
are
the
chosen
of
alla
will
alone
do
the
work
which
lies
before
us
marked
out
so
plainly
that
we
can
not
deviate
from
it
inshalla
alone
we
will
do
what
nizam
ali
khan
will
wonder
at
in
his
zenana
as
he
sits
smoking
like
an
eunuch
ya
kureem
alla
thou
art
witness
that
thy
servant
s
name
has
been
left
out
from
among
those
who
are
not
to
be
attacked
nizam
ali
and
the
base
infidel
english
have
done
this
but
let
them
beware
thou
canst
revenge
me
on
them
both
if
thou
wilt
his
army
too
felt
the
slight
which
had
been
offered
and
in
their
mad
zeal
might
have
been
led
to
the
gates
of
hyderabad
or
those
of
madras
but
that
was
not
the
sultaun
s
plan
he
had
resolved
on
one
which
had
been
sketched
out
by
his
father
and
which
he
thought
he
had
now
matured
the
possession
of
travancore
had
long
been
coveted
by
his
father
but
he
had
been
repulsed
in
his
attacks
upon
it
and
as
many
of
the
conquered
nairs
had
taken
refuge
in
the
travancore
territory
the
sultaun
now
demanded
that
they
should
be
given
up
as
rebellious
subjects
this
being
indignantly
refused
as
he
expected
he
at
length
marched
from
coimbatoor
at
the
head
of
thousand
men
the
flower
of
his
army
the
khan
had
arrived
with
the
remainder
of
the
corps
from
seringapatam
and
had
brought
ameena
with
him
to
the
disgust
and
chagrin
of
his
other
wives
who
during
his
stay
had
vainly
endeavoured
to
begin
their
scheme
of
tormenting
the
gentle
girl
she
had
hitherto
been
unmolested
and
as
happy
as
it
was
possible
for
her
to
be
with
these
companions
and
such
others
as
she
became
acquainted
with
from
time
to
time
the
friends
were
now
once
more
united
and
looked
forward
with
ardour
to
sharing
the
events
and
dangers
of
the
campaign
together
kasim
in
the
daily
march
often
watched
the
palankeen
of
ameena
to
its
destination
and
as
often
as
etiquette
permitted
inquired
after
her
he
heard
she
was
well
and
it
would
have
been
pleasant
to
him
could
he
have
known
the
he
was
often
the
subject
of
interesting
conversation
between
her
and
her
lord
and
that
she
remembered
him
gratefully
and
vividly
through
the
plain
which
extends
westward
to
the
ocean
between
the
huge
and
precipitous
neelgherries
on
the
one
hand
and
the
lofty
and
animallee
range
on
the
other
the
host
of
tippoo
poured
day
by
day
saw
an
advance
of
many
miles
and
the
season
being
favourable
they
marched
on
without
a
check
the
sultaun
was
always
at
the
head
of
the
column
of
march
sometimes
on
foot
with
a
musket
on
his
shoulder
showing
an
example
to
his
regular
infantry
who
followed
in
order
relating
his
dreams
and
pretending
to
inspiration
among
his
sycophants
who
marched
with
him
at
other
times
he
appeared
surrounded
by
his
irregular
cavalry
whom
of
old
he
had
led
against
the
english
at
perambaukum
force
consisting
of
men
of
all
small
and
wiry
mahratta
the
more
robust
mahomedan
men
from
afghanistan
and
from
the
north
of
india
whom
the
splendid
service
and
brilliant
reputation
of
the
sultaun
had
tempted
from
their
distant
homes
sometimes
he
would
be
seen
to
dash
out
from
among
them
as
they
rode
wild
and
turning
his
horse
in
the
plain
would
soon
be
followed
by
the
most
active
and
of
his
officers
whose
bright
costumes
armour
and
gaudy
trappings
glistened
in
the
sun
as
they
rode
at
one
another
then
would
ensue
some
mock
combat
or
skirmish
in
which
the
sultaun
bore
an
active
and
often
a
victorious
part
and
in
which
hard
blows
were
by
no
means
of
rare
occurrence
ever
foremost
in
these
mock
encounters
were
kasim
ali
and
the
khan
his
commander
the
former
however
was
always
the
most
conspicuous
he
was
usually
dressed
in
a
suit
of
which
had
been
given
him
by
the
khan
and
which
he
wore
over
his
usual
silk
or
satin
quilted
vest
on
his
head
was
a
round
steel
cap
surmounted
by
a
steel
spike
and
around
it
was
always
tied
a
shawl
of
the
gayest
red
or
yellow
or
else
a
mundeel
or
other
scarf
of
gold
or
silver
tissue
he
usually
carried
a
long
of
bamboo
with
a
stuffed
ball
at
the
end
from
which
depended
a
number
of
small
streamers
of
various
colours
or
else
his
small
inlaid
matchlock
with
which
from
time
to
time
he
shot
at
birds
or
deer
as
they
bounded
along
in
the
thickets
which
lined
the
road
he
had
expended
all
the
money
he
could
spare
in
purchasing
handsome
trappings
for
his
horse
and
indeed
the
khan
s
noble
gift
well
became
his
silver
ornaments
and
the
gay
red
yellow
and
green
khogeer
the
seat
of
which
was
of
crimson
velvet
with
a
deep
fringe
cut
into
points
and
hanging
far
below
its
belly
footnote
stuffed
saddle
tippoo
often
noticed
the
young
kasim
since
his
mission
to
hyderabad
and
as
he
attended
the
khan
who
was
always
among
the
crowd
of
officers
near
the
person
of
the
sultaun
he
frequently
had
an
opportunity
of
joining
in
these
in
which
he
was
dreaded
by
many
for
his
strength
perfect
mastery
of
his
weapons
and
beautiful
horsemanship
indeed
the
sultaun
had
himself
on
more
than
one
occasion
crossed
spears
with
the
young
patél
and
been
indebted
for
victory
to
the
courtesy
of
his
antagonist
rather
than
his
own
prowess
he
never
addressed
to
him
more
than
a
word
or
two
during
these
mock
encounters
noticing
him
however
to
the
old
khan
by
whom
the
gracious
speeches
were
related
to
kasim
in
his
tent
kasim
had
been
more
than
usually
fortunate
one
morning
a
few
days
after
they
had
left
coimbatoor
he
had
engaged
rather
roughly
with
another
officer
and
had
overthrown
him
and
the
sultaun
expressed
himself
with
more
than
usual
warmth
to
the
khan
by
the
prophet
we
must
forgive
thy
young
friend
he
said
and
promote
him
didst
thou
see
how
he
overthrew
surmust
khan
just
now
khan
sahib
there
are
few
who
could
do
that
we
had
much
ado
to
persuade
the
khan
that
it
was
accidental
thou
must
tell
the
youth
to
be
more
discreet
in
future
we
would
have
no
man
his
enemy
but
may
your
condescension
increase
cried
the
khan
i
will
tell
the
youth
but
did
my
lord
ever
see
him
shoot
ha
can
he
do
that
also
khan
could
he
hit
me
yonder
goat
thinkest
thou
exclaimed
tippoo
as
he
pointed
to
one
the
patriarch
of
a
herd
browsing
among
some
craggy
rocks
at
a
short
distance
and
which
interrupted
in
its
morning
s
meal
was
bleating
loudly
as
it
looked
over
the
glittering
and
busy
host
which
was
approaching
it
is
a
long
shot
said
the
khan
putting
his
forefinger
between
his
teeth
and
considering
nevertheless
i
think
he
wilt
thou
hold
me
a
wager
he
does
cried
the
sultaun
i
will
bet
thee
a
pair
of
english
pistols
against
that
old
one
of
thine
he
does
not
hit
may
your
favour
never
be
less
upon
your
servant
i
accept
it
cried
the
khan
and
he
turned
round
to
seek
kasim
who
was
behind
among
the
other
officers
the
sultaun
stopped
and
those
around
him
cried
out
a
wager
a
wager
inshalla
the
sultaun
will
win
his
destiny
is
great
kasim
was
brought
from
the
rear
after
some
little
time
to
where
the
sultaun
stood
awaiting
him
the
khan
had
not
told
him
why
and
he
appeared
to
ask
for
orders
all
was
soon
explained
to
him
but
the
distance
was
great
and
he
doubted
his
power
however
not
daring
to
disobey
he
addressed
himself
to
his
task
the
goat
continued
steady
and
after
a
long
aim
he
fired
it
was
successful
the
animal
lost
its
footing
rolled
from
its
high
place
and
ere
any
one
of
the
grooms
could
reach
it
with
a
knife
or
pronounce
the
blessing
before
they
cut
its
throat
it
was
dead
the
ball
had
broken
its
neck
mashalla
wonderful
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
while
some
wondered
at
and
others
envied
the
young
patél
s
success
it
must
have
been
chance
cried
the
sultaun
even
we
who
are
by
the
blessing
of
alla
a
sure
shot
could
not
have
done
that
nevertheless
thou
hast
won
the
pistols
khan
and
shalt
have
them
but
what
say
you
my
friends
to
a
hunt
yonder
are
the
animallee
hills
and
it
is
strange
if
we
find
no
game
we
will
prove
thee
again
young
sir
ere
we
believe
thy
a
hunt
a
hunt
cried
all
and
the
words
were
taken
up
and
passed
from
rank
to
rank
from
regiment
to
regiment
down
the
long
column
until
all
knew
of
it
and
were
prepared
to
bear
their
part
in
the
royal
sport
preparations
were
begun
as
soon
as
the
army
arrived
at
its
men
were
sent
forward
for
information
of
game
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
round
were
collected
by
the
irregular
horse
to
assist
in
driving
it
towards
one
spot
where
it
might
be
attacked
for
a
day
previously
under
the
active
superintendence
of
the
royal
huntsman
the
beaters
with
parties
of
matchlock
and
took
up
positions
all
round
a
long
and
narrow
valley
its
sides
were
thickly
clothed
with
wood
but
it
had
an
open
space
at
the
bottom
through
which
it
was
possible
to
ride
though
with
some
difficulty
on
account
of
the
long
and
rank
grass
the
ground
was
soft
and
marshy
in
places
and
had
been
at
one
time
cultivated
with
rice
as
appeared
by
the
square
levels
constructed
so
as
to
contain
water
large
clumps
of
bamboos
arose
to
an
enormous
height
here
and
there
their
light
foliage
waving
in
the
wind
and
giving
them
the
appearance
of
huge
bunches
of
feathers
among
the
other
dense
trees
by
which
they
were
surrounded
where
the
ground
was
not
marshy
it
was
covered
with
short
sward
in
some
places
green
in
others
parched
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
the
sides
of
the
valley
arose
steeply
for
five
or
six
hundred
feet
sometimes
presenting
a
richly
coloured
declivity
from
which
hung
the
graceful
leaf
of
the
wild
plantain
creepers
innumerable
smaller
bamboos
and
other
light
and
graceful
foliage
amongst
which
was
mingled
the
huge
leaf
and
sturdy
stem
of
the
teak
far
above
the
head
of
the
by
an
abrupt
rock
over
which
a
rivulet
flung
itself
in
a
broken
after
hill
mountain
after
mountain
towered
into
the
fleecy
mists
and
so
lofty
as
the
neelgherries
which
in
the
distance
on
the
right
appeared
like
a
huge
blue
wall
except
where
the
sun
glistened
upon
a
precipice
of
many
thousand
feet
in
height
or
where
a
vast
chasm
or
jutting
shoulder
threw
a
broad
shadow
over
the
still
very
lofty
and
wooded
almost
to
the
summit
a
strong
body
of
infantry
had
been
placed
across
the
mouth
of
the
valley
with
directions
to
throw
up
stockades
in
the
elephant
paths
and
what
game
it
was
possible
to
drive
in
from
the
plain
had
thus
been
compelled
to
enter
and
lay
it
was
thought
securely
in
the
valley
one
or
two
elephants
had
been
seen
which
gave
hope
of
more
upon
the
back
of
that
noble
elephant
hyder
which
was
taken
at
the
siege
of
seringapatam
and
still
adorns
if
he
be
not
recently
dead
the
processions
of
the
present
nizam
in
a
howdah
of
richly
chased
and
carved
silver
lined
with
blue
velvet
sat
various
guns
and
rifles
supported
by
a
rail
in
front
of
him
and
ready
to
his
hand
only
one
favourite
attendant
accompanied
him
who
was
in
the
khowass
or
seat
behind
and
had
charge
of
his
powder
and
bullets
the
sultaun
s
dress
was
quite
plain
and
except
for
his
peculiar
turban
he
could
not
have
been
distinguished
his
cortége
was
gorgeous
beyond
imagination
as
soon
as
the
usual
beat
of
the
had
announced
that
he
had
mounted
his
elephant
all
who
had
others
allowed
them
hurried
after
him
dressed
in
their
gayest
clothes
and
brightest
colours
fifty
or
sixty
elephants
were
there
of
that
company
all
rushing
along
close
together
in
a
body
at
a
rapid
pace
around
them
was
a
cloud
of
irregular
cavalry
who
no
longer
fettered
by
any
kind
of
discipline
rode
tumultuously
shouting
brandishing
spears
and
matchlocks
and
occasionally
firing
their
pistols
in
the
air
the
hoarse
sent
forth
their
dull
booming
sound
mingled
with
the
trampling
of
the
horses
and
at
times
the
shrill
trumpeting
of
the
elephants
the
army
had
cast
aside
its
uniform
for
the
day
officers
and
men
were
dressed
in
their
gayest
and
most
picturesque
and
waistbands
and
vests
of
every
hue
and
armed
with
weapons
of
all
kinds
swords
and
shields
matchlocks
and
heavy
spears
such
as
had
not
these
brought
their
own
muskets
and
ammunition
thousands
had
gone
on
before
and
were
seen
crowding
the
sides
of
the
entrance
to
the
valley
but
kept
back
by
the
exertions
of
the
huntsmen
in
order
that
the
sultaun
should
enter
first
and
take
up
his
position
in
the
most
open
place
while
the
game
should
be
gradually
aroused
and
driven
towards
him
from
the
shape
of
the
valley
and
its
almost
perpendicular
sides
it
was
impossible
to
surround
it
so
as
to
make
a
simultaneous
advance
from
all
sides
one
of
the
sultaun
s
own
elephants
had
been
sent
for
the
khan
and
kasim
who
were
desired
to
keep
as
near
him
as
the
crowd
would
allow
they
reached
the
entrance
of
the
glen
at
last
and
by
the
streamlet
they
met
the
chief
huntsman
who
was
ready
to
lead
them
to
the
spot
they
should
occupy
but
the
sultaun
would
not
permit
this
let
us
advance
together
he
cried
i
see
the
end
of
the
glen
is
occupied
by
men
so
nothing
can
escape
us
bismilla
let
the
signal
be
given
to
it
had
been
previously
agreed
upon
and
the
discharge
of
a
small
which
had
been
dragged
to
the
spot
awoke
a
thousand
echoes
in
the
quiet
glen
and
the
merry
thousands
with
one
hoarse
shout
rushed
forward
chapter
xxix
it
was
a
and
magnificent
sight
to
see
the
advance
of
that
mighty
hunting
party
into
the
glen
scarcely
a
quarter
of
a
mile
across
the
numerous
elephants
and
horsemen
were
so
closed
together
that
it
was
impossible
for
anything
to
escape
the
line
which
now
slowly
but
steadily
advanced
the
distance
from
the
mouth
to
the
waterfall
was
not
more
than
of
a
mile
and
nearly
straight
so
that
the
greater
part
of
the
intervening
distance
could
be
seen
some
places
presenting
a
thick
and
impenetrable
jungle
in
others
open
as
we
have
before
stated
along
the
most
abrupt
sides
and
in
advance
of
the
royal
party
men
were
stationed
who
as
the
line
advanced
discharged
rockets
which
whizzing
into
the
air
descended
at
a
short
distance
among
the
trees
and
brushwood
and
urged
on
the
game
to
the
end
where
it
was
met
by
other
discharges
hundreds
of
men
bore
large
flat
drums
which
they
beat
incessantly
with
sticks
and
from
time
to
time
the
broken
and
monotonous
sound
of
the
which
accompanied
tippoo
and
showed
where
he
was
mingled
with
the
din
of
shouts
screams
halloos
the
shrill
blasts
of
the
collery
horn
the
shriller
trumpetings
of
the
elephants
and
the
neighings
of
the
wild
and
frightened
horses
all
these
noises
collectively
reverberated
through
the
narrow
glen
and
from
the
echoes
there
arose
one
vast
chaos
of
stunning
sound
the
effect
of
which
was
assisted
by
the
clear
air
while
it
produced
the
wildest
excitement
among
the
hunters
at
first
no
game
was
seen
except
the
wild
hog
of
the
country
which
in
hundreds
arose
from
their
ran
hither
and
thither
confusedly
among
the
crowd
upsetting
and
seriously
wounding
a
man
or
two
or
a
timid
deer
occasionally
unable
to
escape
up
the
sides
and
terrified
by
the
din
tried
to
break
the
line
and
perished
in
the
attempt
innumerable
peafowl
arose
and
with
loud
screaming
flew
onwards
or
alighted
upon
the
sides
of
the
glen
and
thus
escaped
and
birds
of
every
plumage
darted
from
tree
to
tree
large
flocks
of
parroquets
flew
screaming
into
the
air
and
after
wheeling
rapidly
once
or
twice
alighted
further
on
or
rising
high
took
at
once
a
flight
over
the
shoulder
of
the
glen
and
disappeared
at
length
two
huge
black
bears
were
roused
from
their
den
among
some
rocks
which
overhung
the
little
stream
and
with
loud
roars
which
were
heard
by
all
strove
to
pass
through
the
line
they
were
met
by
the
swords
and
shields
of
fifty
men
upon
whom
they
rushed
and
though
they
strove
gallantly
for
their
lives
and
wounded
several
they
were
cut
to
pieces
the
party
had
now
proceeded
about
half
way
and
there
was
before
the
sultaun
s
elephant
a
patch
of
dry
rank
grass
which
reached
above
its
above
old
hyder
s
who
far
exceeded
all
the
rest
in
height
it
was
of
small
extent
however
and
was
already
half
surrounded
by
elephants
with
their
gay
howdahs
and
more
gaily
dressed
riders
hold
cried
the
sultaun
we
would
try
this
alone
or
with
only
a
few
it
is
a
likely
place
come
khan
and
you

sahib
and
you

see
what
ye
can
do
to
help
us
now
kasim
ali
prove
to
me
that
thou
canst
bismilla
cried
one
and
all
and
the
mahouts
urging
on
the
noble
beasts
they
entered
the
long
grass
together
they
had
not
gone
many
yards
when
hyder
who
led
raised
his
white
trunk
high
into
the
air
giving
at
the
same
time
one
of
those
low
growls
which
proved
there
was
something
concealed
before
him
shabash
hyder
cried
the
sultaun
thou
shalt
eat
goor
for
this
get
on
my
son
get
on
the
noble
beast
seemed
almost
to
understand
him
for
he
quickened
his
pace
even
without
the
command
of
the
mahout
at
that
moment
a
rocket
discharged
from
the
side
whizzed
through
the
grass
before
them
the
effect
was
instantaneous
two
beautiful
tigers
arose
at
once
one
of
them
stood
for
an
instant
looking
proudly
around
him
and
lashing
his
tail
as
he
surveyed
the
line
of
elephants
several
of
which
were
restless
and
cowardly
the
other
tried
to
sneak
off
but
was
stopped
by
a
shot
which
turned
him
and
with
a
terrific
roar
which
sounded
clear
far
above
the
din
of
the
beaters
it
charged
the
nearest
elephant
it
was
beaten
off
however
receiving
several
shots
and
was
then
followed
by
a
crowd
of
the
hunters
kasim
and
the
khan
had
a
mind
to
pursue
it
too
but
the
former
s
attention
was
at
once
attracted
to
the
sultaun
who
having
fired
and
wounded
the
other
tiger
had
been
charged
by
it
and
had
just
fired
again
he
had
missed
however
and
the
animal
excited
to
fury
had
sprung
at
old
far
different
foe
to
that
his
companion
had
attacked
hyder
had
received
the
onset
firmly
and
as
the
tiger
strove
to
fasten
upon
his
shoulders
had
kicked
him
off
but
at
the
second
charge
when
the
sultaun
could
not
fire
the
tiger
had
seized
the
elephant
s
leg
and
was
tearing
it
with
all
the
energy
of
rage
which
now
defied
his
exertions
to
shake
him
off
in
vain
did
the
sultaun
try
to
fire
he
could
see
the
tiger
only
for
a
moment
at
a
time
and
as
hyder
was
no
longer
steady
he
again
missed
his
aim
kasim
was
however
near
and
with
others
was
anxiously
watching
his
opportunity
to
fire
but
ere
he
could
do
so
one
of
the
men
on
foot
a
stout
brawny
soldier
with
sword
drawn
and
his
buckler
on
his
arm
and
to
whom
death
had
no
terror
in
comparison
with
gaining
distinction
under
the
sultaun
s
own
eye
dashed
at
the
tiger
and
dealt
him
a
fierce
blow
on
the
loins
the
blood
gushed
forth
and
the
brute
instantly
quitting
his
hold
turned
upon
the
man
with
a
roar
which
appalled
all
hearts
the
latter
met
him
manfully
but
was
unskilful
or
the
beast
was
too
powerful
all
was
the
work
of
an
instant
the
tiger
and
the
man
rolled
upon
the
ground
only
one
arose
the
lacerated
and
bleeding
body
of
the
brave
fellow
lay
there
his
features
turned
upwards
to
the
sun
and
his
eyes
fixed
in
the
leaden
stare
of
death
now
was
kasim
s
opportunity
as
the
tiger
looked
around
him
for
an
instant
to
make
another
fired
the
brute
reeled
a
few
paces
to
the
foot
of
the
sultaun
s
elephant
fell
back
and
his
dying
struggles
were
shortened
by
the
vigorous
kicks
of
the
old
elephant
who
bandied
the
carcass
between
his
legs
like
a
football
bus
bus
old
hyder
cried
the
sultaun
who
had
been
soundly
shaken
enough
enough
he
is
to
thy
friend
yonder
not
satisfied
yet
well
then
this
to
please
thee
and
he
fired
again
it
was
apparently
sufficient
for
the
noble
beast
became
once
more
composed
while
the
mahout
dismounted
to
examine
the
elephant
s
wounds
the
sultaun
made
some
hurried
inquiries
regarding
the
man
who
had
been
killed
no
one
however
knew
him
so
directing
his
body
to
be
borne
to
the
rear
and
the
mahout
having
reported
that
there
was
no
injury
of
consequence
done
to
hyder
the
sultaun
and
with
him
the
whole
line
once
more
pressed
forward
footnote
as
he
passed
kasim
the
sultaun
now
greeted
him
heartily
thou
didst
me
good
service
youth
he
cried
but
for
thee
my
poor
hyder
would
have
been
sorely
hurt
sharp
there
may
be
more
work
for
thy
gun
so
indeed
there
was
at
every
step
as
they
advanced
the
quantity
of
game
appeared
to
increase
another
bear
was
aroused
and
after
producing
a
vast
deal
of
merriment
and
shouting
was
slain
as
the
former
ones
had
been
several
hyænas
were
speared
or
shot
guns
were
discharged
in
all
directions
at
the
deer
and
hogs
which
were
everywhere
running
about
and
bullets
were
flying
much
to
the
danger
of
those
engaged
in
the
wild
and
animated
scene
indeed
one
or
two
men
were
severely
wounded
during
the
day
suddenly
when
they
had
nearly
reached
the
head
of
the
glen
the
sultaun
who
was
leading
stopped
the
others
hastened
after
him
as
fast
as
the
thick
crowd
would
allow
and
all
beheld
a
sight
which
raised
their
excitement
to
the
utmost
before
them
on
a
small
open
spot
under
a
rock
close
to
the
right
side
of
the
glen
stood
three
elephants
one
a
huge
male
the
others
a
female
and
her
calf
of
small
stature
no
one
were
breathless
with
anxiety
for
it
was
impossible
to
say
whether
it
would
be
advisable
to
attack
the
large
elephant
where
he
stood
or
to
allow
him
to
advance
the
latter
seemed
to
be
the
most
prevalent
opinion
and
the
sultaun
awaited
his
coming
while
he
hallooed
to
those
in
advance
to
urge
him
on
the
noble
monarch
of
the
forest
stood
awaiting
his
brethren
who
were
thus
trained
to
act
against
him
his
small
red
eye
twinkled
with
excitement
his
looks
were
savage
and
he
appeared
almost
resolved
upon
a
rush
to
endeavour
to
break
the
line
and
escape
or
perish
he
did
not
move
but
stood
holding
a
twig
in
his
trunk
as
if
in
very
excess
of
thought
he
had
torn
it
down
and
still
held
it
however
there
was
no
time
for
consideration
as
the
sultaun
raised
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
several
shots
were
fired
and
the
noble
beast
impelled
by
rage
and
agony
rushed
at
once
upon
the
nearest
elephant
among
his
enemies
a
shower
of
balls
met
him
but
he
heeded
them
not
he
was
maddened
and
could
see
or
feel
only
his
own
revenge
in
vain
the
mahout
of
the
elephant
that
was
attacked
strove
to
turn
his
beast
which
had
been
suddenly
paralysed
by
fear
but
the
wild
one
appeared
to
have
no
revengeful
feelings
against
his
fellow
while
they
all
looked
on
without
being
able
to
afford
the
least
aid
the
wild
elephant
had
seized
in
his
trunk
the
mahout
of
the
one
he
had
attacked
wheeled
him
round
high
in
the
air
and
dashed
him
upon
the
ground
a
cry
of
horror
burst
from
all
present
and
a
volley
of
bullets
were
rained
upon
him
it
had
the
effect
of
making
him
drop
the
body
but
though
sorely
wounded
he
did
not
fall
and
retreating
he
passed
from
their
sight
into
the
thick
jungle
pursue
pursue
cried
tippoo
from
his
elephant
ya
mahomed
are
our
beards
to
be
defiled
by
such
a
brute
inshalla
we
will
have
him
yet
a
hundred
rupees
to
him
who
shoots
him
the
crowd
hurried
on
their
excitement
had
reached
almost
a
kind
of
madness
and
the
reward
offered
by
the
sultaun
and
the
hope
of
his
favour
had
operated
as
a
powerful
stimulus
everyone
scrambled
to
be
first
horsemen
and
foot
and
those
who
rode
the
elephants
all
in
confusion
and
shouting
more
tumultuously
than
ever
all
other
game
was
disregarded
in
the
superior
excitement
even
two
panthers
who
roused
at
last
savagely
charged
everybody
and
everything
they
came
near
were
hardly
regarded
and
were
killed
after
a
desperate
battle
by
those
in
the
rear
those
in
the
van
still
hurried
sultaun
leading
the
khan
and
kasim
as
near
to
him
as
etiquette
would
allow
and
the
rest
everywhere
around
them
they
were
close
to
the
top
of
the
glen
the
murmur
of
the
fall
could
sometimes
be
heard
when
the
shouting
ceased
for
an
instant
and
its
white
and
sparkling
foam
glistened
through
the
branches
of
some
noble
which
stood
around
the
little
basin
the
ground
underneath
them
was
quite
clear
so
that
the
elephants
could
advance
easily
he
is
see
him
cried
the
sultaun
aiming
at
the
wounded
elephant
and
firing
holy
alla
he
comes
be
the
noble
animal
came
thundering
on
with
his
trunk
uplifted
roaring
fearfully
followed
by
two
others
one
a
large
female
who
had
a
small
calf
with
her
not
larger
than
a
buffalo
the
other
a
male
not
nearly
grown
it
was
a
last
and
desperate
effort
to
break
the
line
the
blood
was
streaming
from
fifty
wounds
in
his
sides
and
he
was
already
weak
with
that
one
effort
he
had
hoped
to
have
saved
himself
and
the
female
but
in
vain
as
he
came
on
the
khan
cried
hurriedly
to
kasim
above
the
eye
above
the
eye
you
are
sure
of
him
he
was
met
by
a
shower
of
balls
several
of
which
hit
him
in
the
head
he
seemed
to
stagger
for
a
moment
his
trunk
which
had
been
raised
high
in
the
air
dropped
and
he
fell
his
limbs
quivered
for
an
instant
and
then
he
lay
still
in
death
kasim
s
bullet
had
been
too
truly
aimed
shabash
shabash
he
is
dead
shouted
the
sultaun
wild
with
excitement
now
for
the
rest
spare
the
young
one
now
for
the
she
will
be
savage
but
she
was
not
so
at
first
she
retreated
as
far
as
the
rock
would
allow
her
and
placing
herself
between
her
enemies
and
her
calf
which
unconscious
of
danger
still
strove
to
suck
her
milk
she
tried
to
protect
it
from
the
shot
that
hit
her
almost
every
time
now
and
then
she
would
utter
low
plaintive
moans
which
if
those
who
fired
at
her
possessed
any
feeling
would
have
pleaded
with
them
to
leave
her
unmolested
at
times
goaded
on
by
maddening
pain
she
charged
the
line
but
only
to
be
driven
back
foiled
and
disheartened
ya
alla
cried
kasim
will
they
not
let
her
go
and
the
young
one
listen
khan
to
her
moans
by
the
prophet
i
will
not
can
not
but
the
others
continued
the
attack
and
it
was
evident
that
she
could
not
hold
out
much
longer
she
made
one
more
desperate
effort
but
was
beaten
back
by
loud
shouts
and
rockets
and
her
moans
and
the
cries
of
the
calf
became
more
piteous
than
ever
for
the
sake
of
alla
put
her
out
of
pain
said
the
khan
aim
now
again
just
over
the
eye
in
the
temple
be
steady
the
shot
is
sure
to
kill
now
see
they
are
going
to
fire
again
at
kasim
raised
his
unerring
matchlock
the
firing
had
ceased
at
the
were
loading
one
sharp
crack
was
heard
and
the
poor
beast
sank
down
without
a
moan
or
a
struggle
a
crowd
rushed
forward
to
seize
the
calf
which
was
pushing
its
mother
with
its
proboscis
and
head
as
if
to
raise
her
up
uttering
even
more
touching
and
piteous
cries
than
ever
alas
to
no
purpose
it
had
by
a
miracle
escaped
the
shower
of
balls
and
was
strong
enough
to
give
much
trouble
to
its
captors
ere
it
was
secured
the
sultaun
who
had
looked
on
in
silence
now
dismounted
to
examine
it
and
all
his
officers
and
courtiers
mahomedan
and
hindoo
followed
his
example
the
scene
was
a
striking
one
as
that
group
stood
beneath
the
shade
of
the
noble
by
the
waterfall
and
the
clear
stream
which
murmured
over
shining
pebbles
behind
them
was
the
rock
a
sheer
precipice
of
fifty
feet
covered
with
flowers
and
creepers
and
beautiful
mosses
by
it
lay
the
dead
female
and
near
her
the
male
elephant
whose
length
some
were
measuring
and
registering
already
more
than
one
had
tried
the
temper
of
his
sword
upon
the
dead
elephant
s
carcass
and
the
sultaun
stepped
forward
to
see
the
exercise
which
requires
a
strong
and
steady
hand
and
a
fair
cut
or
the
sword
would
bend
or
break
many
had
performed
the
feat
with
various
better
than
our
friend
kasim
and
many
others
were
awaiting
their
turn
when
the
young
elephant
bound
and
secured
was
brought
before
the
sultaun
instantly
it
appeared
to
kasim
that
his
eye
lighted
up
with
the
same
cruel
expression
he
had
once
or
twice
noticed
and
his
countenance
to
appear
as
if
a
sudden
thought
had
struck
him
bind
it
fast
he
cried
to
the
attendants
tie
it
so
that
it
can
not
for
the
poor
thing
was
bleating
and
crying
out
loudly
at
its
rude
usage
while
its
innocent
face
and
tremblings
expressed
terror
most
strongly
the
order
was
was
bound
with
ropes
to
two
adjacent
trees
now
cried
the
sultaun
looking
around
him
proudly
and
drawing
his
light
but
keen
blade
by
the
blessing
of
the
prophet
we
are
counted
to
have
some
skill
in
our
us
prove
it
so
saying
and
while
a
shudder
at
the
cruelty
of
the
act
ran
round
the
circle
and
the
hindoos
present
trembled
at
the
impiety
he
bared
his
arm
and
advancing
poised
himself
on
one
foot
while
the
glittering
blade
was
uplifted
above
his
head
at
last
it
descended
but
being
weakly
aimed
the
back
of
the
poor
beast
yielded
to
the
blow
while
it
screamed
with
the
pain
almost
human
was
that
scream
the
sultaun
tried
again
and
again
losing
temper
at
every
blow
but
with
no
better
success
curse
on
the
blade
he
cried
throwing
it
upon
the
ground
it
is
not
sharp
enough
or
we
should
have
cut
the
beast
in
two
pieces
at
a
several
stepped
forward
and
offered
their
swords
he
took
one
and
looked
eye
was
full
of
wanton
mischief
now
ramah
seit
he
cried
to
a
portly
hindoo
banker
who
was
near
thou
shalt
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
said
the
banker
joining
his
hands
and
advancing
your
slave
is
no
soldier
he
never
used
a
sword
in
his
peace
exclaimed
the
sultaun
stamping
on
the
ground
dost
thou
dare
to
disobey
take
the
sword
o
son
of
perdition
and
strike
for
thy
life
else
it
shall
be
worse
for
but
your
slave
is
a
hindoo
urged
the
trembling
banker
to
whom
shedding
the
blood
of
an
elephant
is
it
is
right
it
should
be
so
cried
tippoo
whose
most
dangerous
passion
bigotry
was
instantly
aroused
by
the
speech
what
say
ye
my
friends
this
is
a
kafir
an
enemy
of
the
true
faith
why
should
he
not
be
made
to
help
himself
on
to
perdition
and
he
laughed
a
low
chuckling
brutal
laugh
which
many
remembered
long
after
a
wise
speech
ah
rare
words
whose
speech
is
like
the
sultaun
s
cried
most
of
those
around
let
him
obey
orders
or
die
therefore
take
the
sword
most
holy
sahoukar
continued
the
sultaun
with
mock
politeness
and
strike
thy
the
poor
man
in
very
dread
of
his
life
which
indeed
had
been
little
worth
had
he
and
made
a
feeble
stroke
amidst
many
protestations
of
want
of
skill
his
excuses
were
received
with
shouts
of
laughter
and
derision
by
the
ribald
soldiery
who
with
many
of
his
flatterers
now
surrounded
the
sultaun
and
urged
him
on
the
man
was
forced
to
repeat
the
blow
many
times
nor
was
there
a
hindoo
present
who
was
not
compelled
to
take
a
part
in
the
inhuman
barbarity
why
dwell
on
the
scene
further
the
miserable
animal
was
hacked
at
by
the
strong
and
by
the
and
moaning
the
while
in
tones
of
pain
and
agony
which
grew
fainter
and
fainter
until
death
released
it
from
its
tormentors
then
only
did
the
sultaun
remount
his
elephant
and
the
human
tiger
sated
for
that
day
with
blood
hunted
no
more
by
alla
and
his
prophet
said
kasim
to
the
khan
as
they
returned
and
unable
any
longer
to
keep
his
indignant
silence
should
there
be
a
repetition
of
this
i
vow
to
thee
i
will
forswear
his
service
this
is
the
second
instance
i
have
seen
of
his
cruelty
hast
thou
forgotten
the
bull
i
have
not
said
the
khan
i
well
remember
it
but
this
is
the
worst
thing
he
has
ever
done
and
is
the
effect
of
the
refusal
of
the
marriage
he
is
ever
thus
after
being
violently
provoked
but
it
is
much
if
alla
does
not
repay
him
for
it
with
shall
their
horses
were
at
the
entrance
of
the
glen
and
alighting
from
their
elephant
they
mounted
them
and
rode
on
towards
the
camp
which
with
its
innumerable
white
tents
could
be
seen
from
the
elevated
ground
on
which
they
then
stood
at
about
two
miles
distant
backed
by
the
blue
distance
and
the
noble
range
of
the
neelgherry
mountains
here
and
there
groves
of
date
or
studded
the
plain
and
in
places
were
seen
dense
jungles
between
which
were
open
patches
of
cultivation
and
little
villages
with
their
white
temples
or
mosques
the
thousands
who
had
come
out
for
the
sport
were
now
returning
some
in
crowds
together
singing
a
wild
song
in
chorus
others
in
smaller
groups
chatting
upon
the
events
of
the
day
here
and
there
was
a
palankeen
its
bearers
crying
their
monotonous
song
as
they
moved
bearing
to
the
camp
either
some
one
too
indolent
or
too
grand
to
ride
on
horseback
or
else
the
fair
inhabitant
of
the
sultaun

or
some
other
harem
who
had
been
allowed
to
see
as
much
as
was
possible
of
the
amusement
of
the
royal
hunt

is
surely

khanum

kasim

its
appearance
met
his
view
at
a
turn
of
the
road
yes
said
the
khan
she
has
been
dull
of
late
and
i
begged
her
to
come
out
she
could
have
seen
nothing

she
could

that
butchery
was
horrible

how
the
creature
bleated
i
wish
it
had
not
been
khan
but
there
is
no
use
speaking
of
it
now
but
how
is
it
that
the
khanum
is
unattended
in
such
a
crowd
as
this

might
insult

they
urged
their

into
a
canter
and
were
soon
with
her

the

to
the

ameena
well
remembered
the
tones
of
his
voice
though
she
had
not
heard
it
for
some
months
it
is
not
safe
that
the

then

we
will
not
leave
in
a

minutes
however
the
sultaun
who
they
thought
was
before
but
who
had
lingered
behind
to
shoot
deer
advanced
rapidly
on
horseback
at
the
head
of
the
brilliant
group
of
his
officers
gay
sight
were
they
as
the
afternoon
sun
glanced
from
spear
and
sword
from
shield
matchlock
and
steel
cap
and
from
their
fluttering
scarfs
of
gay
colours
and
gold
and
silver
tissue
a
band
of
spearmen
bearing
the
heavy
spears
of
the
carnatic
ornamented
with
gay
tassels
preceded
him
calling
out
his
titles
in
extravagant
terms
and
running
at
their
full
speed
behind
him
was
the
crowd
of
officers
and
attendants
checking
their
gaily
caparisoned
and
plunging
horses
and
quite
in
the
rear
followed
the
whole
of
the
elephants
their
bells
jingling
in
a
confused
clash
and
urged
on
by
their
drivers
at
their
fullest
speed
to
keep
pace
with
the
horses
the
sultaun
sat
his
beautiful
grey
arab
with
the
ease
and
grace
of
a
practised
cavalier
now
checking
the
ardent
creature
and
nearly
throwing
him
backwards
now
urging
him
on
to
make
bounds
and
leaps
which
showed
how
admirably
he
had
been
taught
his
paces
and
displayed
his
own
and
his
rider
s
figure
to
the
best
advantage
by
alla
tis
a
gallant
sight
kasim
said
the
khan
for
they
had
drawn
up
to
one
side
as
the
cavalcade
came
thundering
on
over
a
level
and
open
spot
to
let
it
pass
looking
at
them
a
soldier
s
eye
glistens
and
his

swells

cried
to

said
kasim
but
not
as
it
would
were
he
who
rides
yonder
a
man
whom
i
could
love
as
well
as
inshalla
cried
the
khan
thou
wilt
forget
s
work
ere
long
and
then
thou
wilt
love
the
lion
of
the
faith

terrible

but
see
he
beckons
to
me
so
remain
thou
with
the
khanum
and
bring
her
into
and
so
saying
the
khan
gave
the
rein
to
his
impatient
charger
and
bounded
onwards
to
meet
the
sultaun
who
appeared
to
welcome
him
kindly
kasim
saw
the
khan
draw
up
beside
him
joining
his
hands
as
if
speaking
to
him
and
as
the
wild
and
glittering
group
hurried
by
horses
and
elephants
intermingled
he
lost
sight
of
him
among
the
crowd
and
the
cavalcade
rapidly
disappeared
behind
a
grove
of
trees
and
now
she
who
for
many
months
had
often
filled
his
dreams
by
night
and
been
the
almost
constant
companion
of
his
thoughts
by
day
was
alone
with
him
he
had
seen
her
fair
and
tiny
hand
shut
the
door
of
the
palankeen
which
was
an
impenetrable
screen
to
his
longing
eyes
and
he
would
have
given
anything
he
possessed
for
one
have
heard
one
word
though
he
dared
not
have
spoken
to
her
and
in
truth
the
thoughts
of
the
fair
inmate
of
the
vehicle
which
was
being
borne
along
at
the
utmost
speed
of
the
bearers
were
busied
also
in
a
variety
of
speculations
upon
her
young
guardian
did
he
remember
her
still
had
he
still
the
handkerchief
with
which
his
wound
had
been
bound
for
he
had
never
returned
it
did
he
remember
how
she
handed
him
matchlock
after
matchlock
to
fire
upon
the
wild
mahrattas
and
cried
with
the
rest
shabash
when
they
said
his
aim
was
true
she
had
not
forgotten
the
most
trivial
incident
for
her
heart
in
the
lack
of
society
had
brooded
on
these
occurrences
they
were
associated
too
in
her
youthful
mind
with
the
appearance
of
one
so
noble
and
gallant
of
whom
she
heard
such
constant
and
florid
encomiums
from
the
khan
her
husband
that
it
would
have
been
strange
had
she
not
dwelt
on
this
remembrance
with
more
than
friendship
for
the
author
of
them
but
the
current
of
these
his
noble
figure
was
present
to
her
he
had
dashed
on
hotly
in
pursuit
of
the
mahrattas
suddenly
and
rudely
interrupted
by
a
hubbub
the
reason
of
which
she
could
not
at
first
comprehend
the
bearers
were
proceeding
rapidly
when
at
a
turning
of
the
cross
road
which
they
had
taken
for
shortness
they
perceived
an
elephant
one
of
the
royal
procession
which
either
maddened
by
the
excitement
of
the
hunt
or
goaded
to
desperation
by
its
driver
was
running
hither
and
thither
upon
the
road
in
the
wildest
manner
the
mahout
repeatedly
drove
his
sharp
ankoos
into
its
lacerated
head
but
this
appeared
to
enrage
and
make
it
the
more
restive
instead
of
compelling
it
to
go
forward
as
was
evidently
his
wish
footnote
pointed
goads
with
which
elephants
are
driven
the
bearers
stopped
suddenly
and
appeared
irresolute
to
attempt
to
pass
the
infuriated
animal
was
madness
and
yet
what
to
do
immediately
was
difficult
to
determine
for
the
road
was
bounded
by
a
thick
and
impenetrable
hedge
of
the
prickly
pear
it
was
in
vain
that
kasim
shouted
to
the
mahout
to
go
on
for
he
did
not
immediately
comprehend
the
cause
of
the
elephant
s
behaviour
the
obstinate
beast
could
not
be
moved
in
the
direction
was
impossible
to
force
him
through
the
hedge
and
it
was
frightful
to
see
his
behaviour
and
to
hear
the
wild
screams
and
trumpetings
he
uttered
when
struck
with
the
sharp
goad
kasim
saw
there
was
danger
but
he
had
little
time
for
thought
he
however
drew
his
sword
and
had
just
ordered
the
bearers
to
retreat
behind
the
corner
when
the
elephant
which
by
a
sudden
turn
had
seen
what
was
behind
uplifted
its
trunk
and
with
a
loud
cry
dashed
forward
kasim
was
brave
and
cool
and
yet
there
was
something
so
frightful
in
the
desperate
rush
of
the
maddened
animal
that
his
heart
almost
failed
him
nor
could
he
discover
whether
it
was
himself
or
the
palankeen
that
was
the
object
of
the
elephant
s
attack
but
he
had
confidence
in
the
activity
of
his
horse
sword
was
in
his
hand
and
he
little
feared
for
himself
the
elephant
s
advance
was
instantaneous
kasim
saw
the
palankeen
was
his
object
and
dashing
forward
almost
as
he
reached
it
he
struck
with
his
whole
force
at
the
brute
s
trunk
which
was
just
within
reach
the
blow
and
pain
turned
the
animal
from
his
purpose
but
his
huge
bulk
grazed
the
palankeen
which
with
its
terrified
bearers
fell
heavily
and
rudely
to
the
ground
and
rolled
upon
its
side
kasim
heard
the
scream
of
ameena
who
had
been
unable
to
discover
the
cause
of
the
alarm
and
was
afraid
to
open
the
door
the
moment
the
shock
was
given
and
throwing
himself
from
his
horse
he
hurried
to
her
assistance
for
he
was
certain
she
must
be
severely
hurt
this
was
no
time
for
ceremony
in
an
instant
the
palankeen
was
set
upright
the
door
opened
and
seeing
the
fair
girl
lying
as
he
thought
senseless
within
he
cried
out
for
water
while
he
supported
her
inanimate
figure
and
poured
forth
a
torrent
of
passionate
exclamations
which
he
could
not
restrain
but
no
water
was
there
to
be
had
and
it
was
fortunate
that
the
lady
had
received
no
serious
injury
she
was
stunned
and
extremely
terrified
but
a
few
moments
of
rest
and
the
consciousness
of
kasim
s
presence
revived
her
instantly
a
thought
of
her
situation
and
her
own
modesty
caused
her
to
cover
herself
hurriedly
with
her
veil
which
had
become
disarranged
and
not
daring
to
look
upon
kasim
whose
incoherent
inquiries
were
sounding
in
her
ears
she
implored
him
in
a
few
broken
sentences
to
leave
her
and
to
have
her
carried
onwards
he
obeyed
though
he
would
have
given
worlds
to
have
heard
her
voice
longer
broken
and
agitated
as
it
was
he
withdrew
sadly
yet
respectfully
and
the
danger
being
the
elephant
had
fled
madly
down
the
road
by
which
they
had
pursued
their
way
to
the
camp

xxx
but
he
saw
my
must
have
seen
it
cried
ameena
as
after
relating
the
adventure
to
her
lord
she
was
lying
upon
the
soft
cushions
which
had
been
spread
for
her
i
was
not
sensible
and
he
thought
i
must
be
hurt
ah
what
wilt
thou
not
think
of
me
my
lord
and
she
hid
her
burning
face
in
her
hands
upon
the
pillow
what
matter
fairest
replied
the
khan
as
bending
over
her
with
much
concern
in
his
countenance
he
parted
the
hair
upon
her
forehead
and
kissed
it
tenderly
what
matter
had
it
been
another
indeed
who
had
opened
thy
palankeen
the
officious
rascal
should
have
paid
dearly
for
his
temerity
but
should
it
concern
thee
did
he
not
save
thy
life
and
is
he
not
my
friend
and
now
again
have
we
not
cause
to
be
thankful
to
him
let
this
not
distress
thee
therefore
but
praise
alla
as
i
do
that
thou
art
it
was
not
however
the
simple
gaze
of
kasim
upon
her
face
that
had
disturbed
the
agitated
girl
though
in
confessing
this
to
her
lord
she
sought
ease
from
other
thoughts
which
were
engrossing
her
he
had
seen
her
face
happy
were
it
if
that
had
been
the
only
result
of
the
accident
but
the
passionate
words
which
in
his
anxiety
for
her
he
had
uttered
had
fallen
upon
her
ears
and
but
too
readily
accorded
with
her
own
previous
thoughts
she
remembered
too
as
she
looked
around
with
returning
consciousness
after
the
shock
how
she
had
seen
his
expressive
eyes
lighted
up
with
enthusiasm
and
anxiety
gazing
on
her
and
she
had
read
in
them
even
had
he
not
spoken
that
he
loved
her
and
when
she
repeated
to
her
husband
again
and
again
that
kasim
had
looked
upon
her
face
that
was
all
she
dared
to
tell
him
of
what
had
happened
poor
ameena
the
khan
s
constant
theme
of
conversation
had
been
kasim
ali
as
from
time
to
time
any
new
feat
of
arms
of
horsemanship
any
new
weapon
or
gay
dress
he
had
worn
attracted
his
attention
he
would
delight
to
relate
all
to
her
minutely
to
recount
how
adroitly
he
had
foiled
such
an
one
how
handsome
he
had
looked
and
to
dwell
upon
these
themes
with
expressions
of
praise
and
satisfaction
at
kasim
s
daily
proving
himself
more
and
more
worthy
of
his
patronage
often
would
he
foretell
an
exalted
station
for
the
young
man
from
the
sultaun
s
early
selection
of
him
to
fulfil
so
delicate
a
mission
as
that
to
hyderabad
and
on
that
very
day
when
he
had
been
beckoned
by
the
sultaun
it
was
to
hear
the
praises
of
kasim
ali
to
be
asked
whether
it
was
not
he
who
had
won
the
reward
he
had
offered
and
upon
his
answering
in
the
affirmative
the
sultaun
had
graciously
bidden
him
bring
kasim
to
the
morning
durbar
when
he
should
be
enrolled
once
more
among
his
personal
attendants
ameena
was
obliged
to
listen
to
all
this
and
after
listening
she
would
brood
over
these
discourses
upon
his
noble
qualities
until
her
heart
grew
sick
at
the
thought
that
to
none
such
would
ever
her
dearest
hopes
for
one
to
love
her
in
whom
should
be
united
all
those
qualities
which
she
heard
he
possessed
had
long
ago
been
blighted
for
ever
she
needed
no
new
event
to
remind
her
of
kasim
s
first
service
nor
to
impress
more
strongly
upon
her
mind
his
noble
but
melancholy
features
which
except
when
lighted
up
by
the
hot
excitement
of
battle
habitually
wore
a
sad
expression
and
yet
the
last
adventure
had
come
like
the
first
unsought
and
unexpected
and
the
consequences
were
sad
to
both
in
ameena
producing
an
inward
shame
a
consciousness
of
harbouring
thoughts
she
dared
not
vain
striving
between
her
honour
to
her
lord
and
her
love
for
the
young
man
his
friend
in
kasim
a
burning
as
it
exists
in
asiatics
is
almost
with
his
high
feelings
of
rectitude
of
respect
nay
of
affection
for
him
he
served
which
was
hardly
to
be
endured
and
thus
it
continued
producing
misery
in
both
except
in
forgetfulness
there
was
indeed
no
alleviation
and
that
was
impossible
for
they
thought
of
little
else
than
of
each
other
through
the
long
hours
of
the
days
and
nights
which
followed
the
sultaun
had
ordered
the
khan
to
bring
kasim
ali
before
him
in
the
morning
after
the
usual
march
but
it
was
in
vain
that
his
messengers
sought
him
to
apprise
him
of
the
order
he
had
been
seen
to
ride
off
after
the
arrival
of
the
khanum
and
was
not
to
be
found
in
truth
the
young
man
felt
himself
unable
to
meet
the
khan
with
any
composure
after
what
had
happened
and
he
also
dreaded
if
ameena
had
heard
the
expressions
he
uttered
that
she
was
offended
he
had
no
possible
means
of
ascertaining
imploring
her
not
to
denounce
him
to
the
khan
as
faithless
and
treacherous
and
under
the
influence
of
these
mingled
and
agitating
feelings
the
young
man
continued
to
ride
hither
and
thither
as
if
without
a
in
some
level
spot
urging
his
horse
into
a
furious
gallop
to
gain
release
from
the
thoughts
which
almost
maddened
allowing
him
to
walk
slowly
while
he
brooded
over
the
exquisite
beauty
and
gentleness
of
her
whom
he
had
twice
saved
from
injury
perhaps
from
destruction
but
the
hour
for
evening
prayer
drew
nigh
and
he
turned
his
horse
towards
the
camp
its
many
fires
were
everywhere
twinkling
upon
the
fast
darkening
plain
and
the
deep
sounds
of
the
evening
mingled
with
the
dull
and
distant
murmur
of
thousands
of
voices
were
borne
clearly
upon
the
evening
wind
he
quickened
his
pace
and
as
the
sonorous
and
musical
voices
of
the
muezzins
among
the
army
proclaiming
the
azan
called
the
faithful
into
their
various
groups
for
prayer
he
rode
up
to
the
khan
s
tent
where
the
usual
number
had
their
carpets
spread
and
awaited
the
proper
moment
for
commencement
kasim
joined
them
but
the
act
of
supplication
had
little
effect
in
quieting
his
agitation
the
idea
that
ameena
might
have
told
all
that
had
passed
precluded
every
other
thought
and
caused
a
feeling
of
apprehension
from
which
he
could
not
release
himself
footnote
call
to
prayer
when
the
prayer
was
ended
the
khan
addressed
him
in
his
usual
kind
and
hearty
manner
and
calling
him
into
his
private
tent
poured
out
his
thanks
and
those
of
ameena
for
his
timely
and
gallant
assistance
in
her
late
extreme
danger
as
he
spoke
kasim
at
once
saw
there
was
no
cause
for
suspicion
and
as
the
dread
of
detection
passed
from
his
heart
a
feeling
of
tumultuous
joy
that
his
words
had
not
been
ill
received
by
her
to
whom
he
had
addressed
them
on
the
instant
filled
its
place
and
for
a
while
disturbed
those
high
principles
which
hitherto
had
been
the
rule
of
his
conduct
and
now
said
the
khan
after
he
had
fairly
overwhelmed
the
young
man
with
thanks
i
have
news
and
good
news
for
thee
thou
art
ordered
to
attend
the
morning
durbar
and
i
suspect
for
thy
good
the
sultaun
may
his
condescension
increase
has
looked
once
more
with
an
eye
of
favour
upon
thee
he
means
to
give
thee
a
command
among
his
guards
and
to
attach
thee
to
his
person
i
shall
lose
thee
therefore
kasim
but
thou
wilt
ever
find
me
as
sincere
and
devoted
a
friend
as
thou
hast
hitherto
done
we
may
soon
be
separated
but
so
long
as
we
march
thus
day
after
day
indeed
so
long
as
this
campaign
continues
we
may
at
least
associate
together
as
we
have
been
accustomed
to
kasim
could
hardly
reply
intelligibly
to
the
khan
s
kind
expressions
that
he
had
been
exerting
his
influence
with
the
sultaun
on
his
account
he
could
have
no
doubt
and
this
with
the
affectionate
friendship
he
had
professed
again
very
powerfully
brought
all
the
young
man
s
best
feelings
to
his
aid
and
he
went
from
his
presence
late
in
the
evening
with
a
determination
to
seek
ameena
no
more
and
if
possible
to
drive
all
concern
for
her
from
his
heart
vain
thought
away
from
the
khan
his
excited
imagination
still
dwelt
upon
her
and
his
visions
that
night
of
their
mutual
happiness
almost
appeared
to
him
an
earnest
that
they
would
be
ultimately
realised
he
accompanied
the
khan
as
usual
during
the
march
for
the
army
proceeded
the
next
morning
on
its
way
and
at
its
early
close
he
rode
with
him
to
the
place
where
the
sultaun
held
his
morning
durbar
in
some
anxiety
as
to
what
would
happen
the
tents
of
the
monarch
had
not
been
pitched
for
under
the
thick
shade
of
some
enormous
there
was
found
ample
space
for
the
assembly
and
pillows
had
been
placed
and
soft
carpets
spread
for
his
reception
one
by
one
the
different
leaders
and
officers
of
rank
arrived
and
dismounting
ranged
themselves
about
the
place
which
had
been
set
apart
for
the
sultaun
their
gay
dresses
somewhat
sobered
in
colour
by
the
deep
shade
the
trees
cast
upon
them
and
contrasting
powerfully
with
the
green
foliage
which
descended
in
heavy
masses
close
to
the
ground
on
the
outskirts
of
the
spot
the
grooms
led
about
their
chargers
whose
loud
and
impatient
neighings
resounded
through
the
grove
on
one
side
the
busy
camp
could
be
seen
as
division
after
division
of
horse
and
foot
arrived
in
turn
and
took
up
their
ground
in
regular
order
at
last
the
sultaun
s
were
heard
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
galloped
up
at
the
head
of
a
crowd
of
attendants
and
immediately
dismounting
advanced
into
the
centre
of
the
group
and
returned
the
low
obeisances
of
those
who
hastened
to
offer
them
there
were
a
few
reports
to
be
listened
to
one
or
two
summary
and
fearful
punishments
to
be
inflicted
and
these
done
the
sultaun
turned
to
rhyman
khan
who
stood
near
him
where
is
the
young
man
he
said
we
have
thought
much
of
him
during
the
night
and
our
dreams
have
confirmed
the
previous
visions
we
have
mentioned
regarding
him
therefore
let
him
be
brought
we
would
fain
do
justice
in
his
case
this
is
a
fortunate
day
and
hour
as
we
have
read
by
the
stars
and
the
planetary
influences
are
kasim
was
at
hand
and
amidst
the
crowd
of
courtiers
sycophants
and
parasites
who
would
have
given
all
they
possessed
to
have
been
so
noticed
he
advanced
performed
the
tusleemât
and
then
stood
with
his
hands
folded
in
an
attitude
of
humility
and
attention
youth
cried
the
sultaun
we
have
heard
that
it
was
thou
who
killed
the
mad
elephant
yesterday
when
our
royal
hand
trembled
and
our
gun
missed
fire
we
offered
a
reward
for
that
thou
claim
it
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
replied
kasim
i
know
not
what
can
i
say
the
khan
answer
for
he
has
already
told
me
all
cried
the
sultaun
therefore
we
have
sent
for
thee
hear
then
and
reflect
on
what
we
say
to
thee
thou
shalt
be
raised
higher
than
thou
wast
before
and
we
will
arrange
thy
pay
hereafter
it
will
be
thy
business
to
attend
on
and
accompany
us
and
in
the
coming
battles
in
which
by
the
aid
of
the
prophet
we
intend
to
eclipse
our
former
achievements
which
are
known
to
here
he
looked
around
and
cries
of
wonderful
the
sultaun
is
great
and
valiant
he
eats
mountains
and
drinks
rivers
before
his
eye
the
livers
of
his
enemies
melt
into
water
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
therefore
he
continued
after
a
pause
do
thy
service
well
and
boldly
and
it
shall
be
good
for
thee
that
thou
hast
eaten
the
salt
of
tippoo
thou
art
jemadar
from
this
time
forth
o
kasim
ali
and
hear
all
of
ye
that
it
is
so
the
congratulations
of
all
fell
upon
the
gladdened
ears
of
the
young
patél
who
in
truth
as
he
bowed
lowly
and
fell
back
among
the
crowd
was
somewhat
bewildered
by
his
new
honour
so
great
and
so
unexpected
now
he
should
rank
with
the
men
of
consequence
he
was
one
himself
and
he
felt
as
was
natural
proud
and
elated
at
his
promotion
the
khan
s
joy
knew
no
bounds
i
thought
he
said
thou
wouldest
be
taken
into
favour
and
have
thy
pay
increased
but
this
is
most
excellent
by
alla
kasim
say
or
think
what
thou
wilt
the
sultaun
has
a
rare
discrimination
wilt
thou
now
forget
the
scene
of
yesterday
and
the
young
elephant
i
shall
never
forget
it
said
kasim
but
i
pray
alla
it
may
never
be
ameen
responded
the
khan
yet
sultaun
and
the
voice
of
the
sultaun
was
again
heard
interrupting
the
khan
proclaim
silence
he
cried
to
the
attendants
and
after
the
loud
cries
of
khamoosh
khamoosh
had
in
some
degree
subsided
he
addressed
the
assembled
officers
whose
number
was
every
moment
increased
by
other
wild
and
martial
figures
from
the
camp
who
crowded
behind
the
rest
on
tiptoe
to
hear
his
address
ye
all
know
he
said
how
the
infidel
rajah
of
has
his
portion
already
with
the
allowed
our
rebellious
and
infidel
subjects
the
nairs
to
have
shelter
in
his
territory
we
have
demanded
them
from
him
and
have
met
with
insult
and
scorn
in
his
replies
are
we
who
are
the
chosen
of
alla
to
bear
this
patiently
let
him
die
let
him
be
sent
to
hell
cried
the
assembly
with
one
voice
their
passions
suddenly
aroused
by
this
abrupt
address
stay
continued
visage
becoming
inflamed
and
his
eye
glistening
like
that
of
a
tiger
s
chafing
into
fury
we
by
the
favour
of
alla
possess
accurate
knowledge
of
the
councils
of
the
unbelievers
and
of
the
kafir
english
we
know
that
this
miserable
rajah
is
upheld
by
them
in
his
contumacy
but
we
have
ere
now
humbled
their
pride
baillie
and
mathews
with
their
are
they
and
we
will
inshalla
humble
them
again
and
drive
them
into
the
sea
they
have
threatened
us
with
war
if
we
attack
the
wall
which
this
rajah
hath
built
upon
our
subjects
territory
and
over
which
we
have
a
right
to
pass
to
cochin
whither
it
is
our
pleasure
to
go
say
therefore
my
friends
shall
there
be
peace
shall
we
who
wear
swords
on
our
thighs
eat
dirt
at
the
hands
of
these
lying
and
damnable
kafirs
or
the
remainder
of
his
speech
was
lost
the
cry
for
war
was
as
one
voice
he
had
appealed
to
the
fierce
passions
of
his
officers
who
saw
only
victory
in
prospect
and
they
had
responded
as
warmly
as
he
could
wish
be
it
so
cried
the
sultaun
when
the
tumult
was
stilled
in
a
few
days
we
shall
see
this
wonderful
wall
of
which
we
hear
things
that
would
produce
terror
in
any
mind
less
strong
or
valiant
than
our
own
and
then
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
by
the
army
of
the
government
which
is
the
gift
of
alla
led
by
him
who
is
an
apostle
sent
to
scourge
all
kafirs
and
sceptics
you
have
your
dismissal
now
and
prepare
your
men
for
this
service
mashalla
victory
awaits
our
footsteps
in
a
few
days
afterwards
the
army
arrived
within
sight
of
the
wall
it
was
of
considerable
height
and
thickness
had
a
broad
and
deep
ditch
in
front
and
presented
a
formidable
obstacle
to
the
invading
army
it
is
probable
that
had
tippoo
attacked
the
wall
at
once
he
might
have
carried
it
by
escalade
but
he
was
evidently
uncertain
as
to
the
result
of
his
negotiations
he
hesitated
for
a
time
to
strike
a
blow
which
must
inevitably
embroil
him
with
the
english
and
therefore
drew
off
a
short
distance
to
the
northward
where
engaged
in
correspondence
with
the
english
and
travancore
governments
he
passed
most
of
his
time
thus
allowing
his
enemy
every
opportunity
to
increase
his
force
and
prepare
for
resistance
kasim
s
post
near
the
sultaun
s
person
led
him
into
daily
and
close
communication
with
the
monarch
and
he
gradually
gained
an
insight
into
his
extraordinary
character
sometimes
when
he
uttered
the
noblest
and
loftiest
sentiments
of
honour
he
would
love
and
respect
him
again
some
frivolous
or
ridiculous
idea
would
get
possession
of
his
imagination
and
drive
him
into
the
commission
of
a
thousand
absurdities
and
terrible
cruelties
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
to
see
beyond
the
precincts
of
the
camp
a
row
of
miserable
hindoos
hanging
upon
trees
who
had
defied
the
sultaun
s
efforts
at
conversion
and
had
preferred
death
rather
than
change
the
religion
of
their
fathers
for
shekh
jaffur
had
arrived
in
camp
with
a
division
of
the
army
which
was
ordered
to
join
from
the
canarese
provinces
where
he
had
been
particularly
active
against
the
nairs
and
to
him
tippoo
delegated
the
direction
of
the
torture
and
punishment
of
those
hindoos
whom
on
the
slightest
pretext
either
of
rebellion
disobedience
or
denial
of
supplies
they
could
get
into
their
hands
with
this
duty
kasim
ali
had
no
concern
but
he
observed
that
under
the
other
it
flourished
and
that
day
after
day
some
wretched
beings
were
dragged
before
the
monarch
whose
death
appeared
to
stay
his
appetite
for
slaughter
till
the
negotiation
should
end
as
he
expected
by
his
letting
loose
his
army
upon
the
defenders
of
travancore
but
month
after
month
passed
and
the
season
was
advancing
the
immense
preparations
of
the
english
the
nizam
and
the
mahrattas
to
join
in
one
common
league
for
his
destruction
were
everywhere
reported
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
strike
some
blow
else
after
the
preparations
he
had
made
and
the
threats
he
had
promulgated
his
conduct
would
appear
in
a
weak
and
puerile
light
to
his
enemies
to
kasim
ali
this
state
of
inactivity
was
insupportable
he
had
hoped
from
the
sultaun
s
address
that
the
army
would
at
once
have
been
led
to
battle
and
he
was
disappointed
beyond
expression
when
after
a
trifling
skirmish
before
the
wall
the
whole
drew
off
to
that
ground
it
was
destined
to
occupy
for
so
long
instead
of
active
employment
in
the
field
in
the
excitement
of
which
he
might
for
the
time
forget
ameena
or
strengthen
his
resolution
to
think
no
more
of
her
with
was
absolute
stagnation
the
life
he
led
was
entirely
the
opposite
of
what
he
wished
it
and
during
the
days
of
idleness
and
inactivity
he
had
little
else
to
do
than
dream
of
her
but
he
refrained
from
seeking
her
even
when
opportunity
was
afforded
by
the
return
of
his
old
friend
the
cook
zoolficar
who
having
been
left
at
seringapatam
by
the
khan
had
been
sent
for
upon
the
misconduct
and
discharge
of
the
one
he
had
brought
with
him
his
arrival
was
heartily
welcomed
both
by
the
khan
and
ameena
by
the
first
because
he
could
once
more
enjoy
his
excellent
cookery
and
most
favourite
concoctions
by
the
lady
because
his
sister
the
old
servant
of
her
family
at
hyderabad
who
had
joined
the
worthy
functionary
at
seringapatam
accompanied
him
to
the
camp
she
was
gladly
welcomed
by
ameena
who
among
the
women
that
attended
upon
her
had
no
one
to
whom
she
cared
to
open
her
heart
for
they
were
all
natives
of
the
south
with
whom
she
had
little
communion
of
thought
and
feeling
and
who
spoke
her
language
indifferently
with
meeran
however
almost
a
new
existence
commenced
while
alone
the
most
part
of
the
the
khan
s
duties
and
attendance
upon
the
sultaun
kept
him
away
from
had
few
occupations
except
her
own
thoughts
which
were
sad
enough
yet
in
meeran
s
society
humble
though
she
was
she
could
ever
find
topics
of
her
home
her
family
her
friends
and
acquaintance
old
subjects
long
gone
by
were
revived
and
dwelt
upon
with
all
the
zest
of
fresh
occurrences
and
the
incidents
of
her
travel
to
the
city
and
every
event
connected
with
herself
since
she
left
her
home
were
repeated
again
and
again
with
that
minuteness
which
is
commonly
the
result
of
a
want
of
other
occupation
it
hardly
needed
the
very
quick
penetration
common
to
a
woman
whose
wits
had
been
sharpened
by
a
residence
in
such
a
city
as
hyderabad
to
discover
very
soon
that
her
young
and
beautiful
mistress
was
unhappy
and
meeran
heard
so
often
of
the
young
patél
as
ameena
still
called
him
and
found
that
she
so
evidently
delighted
to
speak
of
him
and
his
acts
that
she
very
naturally
concluded
that
much
of
her
unhappiness
was
attributable
to
the
young
man
however
innocent
he
might
be
of
the
cause
for
after
speaking
of
him
and
describing
his
noble
appearance
as
she
had
seen
it
on
several
occasions
and
repeating
the
constant
eulogiums
of
her
lord
ameena
would
often
involuntarily
find
a
tear
starting
to
her
eye
or
a
sigh
heave
forth
which
she
fain
would
have
suppressed
but
could
not
now
meeran
had
from
the
first
and
while
there
was
yet
a
chance
of
averting
the
evil
protested
against
the
giving
away
of
her
child
for
so
she
called
ameena
to
a
man
as
old
as
the
khan
for
a
sum
of
money
and
though
she
had
every
respect
for
him
yet
she
could
see
no
harm
after
a
little
consideration
and
the
overcoming
a
few
scruples
of
striving
to
help
the
lovers
she
had
nursed
ameena
at
her
own
breast
she
had
tended
her
from
infancy
had
been
the
confidant
of
all
her
secrets
and
if
the
truth
were
known
had
helped
the
young
girl
to
form
exactly
such
an
idea
of
a
lover
as
it
appeared
kasim
gallant
handsome
and
of
a
fine
generous
temper
kasim
had
renewed
his
acquaintance
with
the
zoolficar
and
on
several
occasions
the
man
had
come
to
his
little
tent
upon
one
excuse
or
another
sometimes
to
talk
over
their
journey
sometimes
to
cook
him
a
dish
he
liked
when
the
khan
was
employed
elsewhere
and
they
did
not
dine
together
often
had
their
conversation
fallen
upon
ameena
and
though
at
first
the
mention
of
her
name
had
been
avoided
by
the
young
jemadar
yet
the
theme
was
so
pleasant
a
one
that
he
insensibly
dwelt
upon
it
more
and
more
soon
kasim
heard
from
the
cook
that
his
sister
was
with
his
young
mistress
and
that
she
was
happier
in
the
society
of
her
old
nurse
than
she
had
been
before
her
arrival
habitual
indulgence
in
conversation
about
her
naturally
begat
a
craving
in
the
young
man
to
know
all
the
particulars
of
ameena
s
daily
existence
the
most
trifling
circumstances
appeared
to
be
welcome
to
him
and
it
was
not
long
ere
zoolficar
finding
that
he
could
not
give
the
information
so
greedily
looked
for
as
minutely
as
was
required
proposed
that
his
sister
should
supply
it
this
however
pleasant
was
nevertheless
a
matter
of
more
difficulty
and
one
that
required
concealment
for
it
would
have
been
at
once
fatal
to
ameena
s
reputation
had
her
favourite
servant
been
seen
in
private
conversation
with
one
like
kasim
ali
despite
of
obstacles
however
they
contrived
to
meet
and
on
the
first
of
these
interviews
the
nurse
saw
clearly
enough
how
passionately
devoted
kasim
was
to
her
fair
mistress
and
how
precious
to
him
was
every
detail
of
her
life
of
her
meek
and
gentle
temper
and
of
her
loving
disposition
the
nurse
would
often
bewail
her
unhappy
destiny
in
being
cut
off
from
all
chance
of
real
happiness
in
company
with
the
khan
and
she
could
appreciate
from
the
evident
agitation
of
the
young
man
and
his
exclamations
how
difficult
it
was
for
him
to
withhold
an
open
declaration
of
his
thoughts
yet
she
could
not
help
seeing
that
through
all
this
there
was
nothing
breathed
of
dishonour
to
the
khan
no
wish
to
meet
her
whom
she
was
sure
he
so
passionately
loved
it
was
not
until
after
some
time
and
many
such
conversations
with
the
young
jemadar
that
meeran
dared
to
mention
to
ameena
that
she
had
seen
him
she
had
heard
from
kasim
the
account
of
his
protection
of
her
from
the
enraged
elephant
and
he
had
confessed
what
he
had
then
uttered
she
knows
of
his
love
then
said
meeran
mentally
and
she
dares
not
mention
it
to
her
old
nurse
we
shall
see
whether
this
humour
will
last
long
inshalla
they
shall
yet
be
happy
in
each
other
s
she
could
not
appreciate
the
nice
morality
either
of
kasim
or
her
young
mistress
she
knew
that
neither
was
happy
and
believed
she
had
in
her
power
the
means
of
making
both
so
could
they
but
meet
she
used
to
say
they
might
speak
to
each
other
and
even
half
the
words
that
i
hear
spoken
by
one
to
the
other
would
set
their
hearts
at
rest
for
but
ameena
grew
really
angry
with
the
woman
that
she
had
dared
to
think
of
such
a
step
much
less
to
speak
of
it
meeran
bore
all
but
she
determined
to
persevere
convinced
that
she
was
acting
for
their
mutual
good
time
passed
on
the
army
advanced
nearer
to
the
wall
and
at
length
the
sultaun
tired
of
inactivity
or
protracted
negotiation
determined
to
strike
the
first
blow
in
the
strife
which
it
was
useless
to
disguise
to
himself
was
fast
approaching
and
could
he
but
possess
himself
of
travancore
his
operations
against
the
english
would
be
materially
aided
his
resolution
was
however
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
made
kasim
with
some
men
had
been
directed
to
examine
a
part
of
the
defence
where
the
wall
joined
a
precipice
some
miles
from
the
camp
and
to
report
the
practicability
of
its
assault
his
statement
confirmed
the
sultaun
s
previous
intentions
and
he
gave
orders
for
the
attacking
thousand
of
the
flower
of
his
prepare
for
immediate
action
kasim
was
aware
that
his
post
would
be
one
of
danger
for
the
sultaun
was
determined
to
lead
the
attack
in
person
and
it
was
more
than
probable
that
he
would
be
bravely
opposed
by
the
defenders
of
the
lines
among
these
were
many
of
the
fugitive
nairs
who
burned
for
an
opportunity
of
revenging
upon
the
sultaun
s
army
the
many
insults
and
oppressions
they
had
suffered
much
however
was
hoped
from
so
powerful
an
attack
on
an
undefended
point
and
the
sultaun
s
order
was
delivered
to
the
army
on
the
afternoon
of
kasim
s
report
the
divisions
for
the
assault
were
ordered
under
arms
after
evening
prayer
and
all
were
in
readiness
and
exulting
that
ere
that
time
on
the
morrow
the
barrier
before
them
would
be
overcome
and
the
dominions
of
their
enemy
open
to
plunder
the
night
was
bright
and
clear
and
cool
there
was
no
wind
and
the
melancholy
and
shrill
notes
of
the
collery
horn
came
up
sharp
upon
the
ear
from
all
parts
of
the
wall
before
them
which
extended
for
miles
on
either
side
lights
were
twinkling
here
and
there
upon
it
showing
that
the
watchers
did
not
sleep
and
sometimes
the
flash
and
report
of
a
musket
or
matchlock
appeared
or
was
heard
fired
by
one
or
other
of
the
parties
the
camp
of
the
sultaun
was
alive
with
preparation
and
the
busy
hum
of
men
arose
high
into
the
still
air
soon
all
was
completed
and
when
it
was
no
longer
doubtful
that
darkness
veiled
their
preparations
the
mass
of
men
moved
slowly
out
of
the
camp
and
led
by
kasim
took
their
way
to
the
place
he
had
discovered
chapter
xxxi
the
huge
column
moved
slowly
and
silently
onwards
aided
by
the
light
of
a
brilliant
moon
the
sultaun
at
its
head
sometimes
on
foot
at
others
on
horseback
or
in
bad
places
upon
his
elephant
cheered
on
his
men
and
officers
with
words
he
knew
would
best
arouse
their
zeal
and
spirit
there
was
hardly
need
however
for
the
army
proceeded
as
fast
as
the
nature
of
the
ground
would
permit
all
night
they
marched
but
slowly
enough
through
the
narrow
and
rugged
road
and
sometimes
through
the
thick
jungles
and
often
the
sultaun
would
turn
to
kasim
and
question
him
about
the
path
evidently
thinking
that
he
had
lost
it
and
that
the
expedition
would
be
in
vain
but
the
young
jemadar
was
sure
of
the
way
the
guides
he
had
taken
with
him
when
he
explored
the
path
in
the
first
instance
were
also
confident
and
as
morning
broke
the
dull
grey
light
disclosed
the
precipitous
rock
which
was
their
object
close
before
them
art
thou
sure
this
is
the
place
kasim
ali
said
the
sultaun
as
he
rode
backwards
and
forwards
vainly
endeavouring
to
find
the
path
which
led
to
the
summit
art
thou
sure
by
the
prophet
it
will
be
worse
for
thee
if
thou
hast
led
us
wrong
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
said
kasim
this
is
the
place
let
the
army
halt
here
for
a
short
time
your
slave
will
take
a
few
of
the
pioneers
and
see
if
it
be
clear
of
the
enemy
but
it
is
not
probable
they
would
defend
it
so
far
from
the
gate
and
in
this
wild
i
will
accompany
thee
replied
the
sultaun
and
despite
the
entreaties
of
the
numerous
officers
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
he
rode
after
kasim
a
strong
body
of
infantry
supported
them
in
case
of
danger
there
was
however
none
the
path
which
was
concealed
from
view
by
a
large
tree
and
ran
up
between
two
high
rocks
was
undefended
a
few
men
might
have
disputed
it
against
a
host
but
the
sultaun
s
threatening
disposition
of
troops
in
front
of
the
gate
which
was
many
miles
distant
had
drawn
all
the
defenders
to
that
spot
and
where
the
wall
terminated
against
the
rock
there
was
no
one
left
to
guard
it
accompanied
by
a
few
of
the
household
slaves
sword
in
hand
kasim
advanced
slowly
and
cautiously
up
the
path
there
was
perfect
silence
except
when
a
jungle
fowl
scared
from
its
roost
by
the
unusual
sound
of
men
s
feet
flew
with
a
loud
whirr
into
the
dense
thickets
beyond
the
pass
or
when
the
ravens
aroused
from
the
trees
below
flew
before
them
from
bush
to
bush
croaking
their
dismal
welcome
to
the
feast
they
seemed
to
anticipate
they
gained
the
top
without
interruption
and
kasim
sending
word
to
the
sultaun
who
had
not
ventured
with
the
leading
party
up
the
pass
that
all
was
safe
went
on
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
and
looked
over
the
scene
before
him
the
night
mists
still
lay
quietly
in
the
hollows
looking
like
unruffled
lakes
in
the
dim
light
and
here
and
there
a
huge
rock
like
the
one
on
which
he
stood
was
surrounded
by
them
and
appeared
like
an
island
immediately
below
him
all
was
clear
and
the
long
columns
and
crowds
of
elephants
moving
majestically
about
and
horsemen
here
and
there
appearing
where
the
jungle
was
thin
or
a
sight
at
which
the
young
soldier
s
blood
danced
briskly
through
his
veins
for
all
were
now
pressing
forward
towards
the
pass
and
he
hoped
that
the
leading
divisions
would
soon
be
at
the
summit
away
to
the
left
the
line
of
wall
with
its
bastions
and
towers
which
so
long
had
been
their
object
of
desire
stretched
over
the
undulating
ground
but
it
was
deserted
except
at
a
distant
point
where
two
or
three
faintly
twinkling
lights
showed
that
a
watch
was
kept
by
the
prophet
thy
road
is
a
rare
one
kasim
ali
said
the
sultaun
who
had
come
up
to
him
unobserved
and
touched
his
shoulder
the
army
will
soon
be
up
though
it
is
somewhat
narrow
dost
thou
see
any
one
stirring
on
the
wall
no
one
my
lord
they
have
all
been
deceived
by
the
troops
before
the
gate
and
imagine
the
attack
is
to
be
made
yes
said
the
sultaun
we
are
unrivalled
in
such
stratagems
it
was
ourself
who
planned
the
ambuscade
which
ended
in
the
discomfiture
of
baillie
and
his
kafirs
and
we
have
ever
exercised
the
talent
which
alla
hath
confided
to
us
among
many
others
of
military
skill
in
which
we
surpass
the
english
and
their
races
be
defiled
how
long
the
sultaun
might
have
continued
the
theme
of
his
own
praises
which
was
always
a
most
pleasant
one
to
him
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
his
harangue
was
rather
rudely
interrupted
by
two
shots
discharged
in
quick
succession
from
a
distant
part
of
the
wall
before
them
one
of
which
whistled
over
their
heads
for
they
were
standing
upon
the
crest
of
the
rock
other
struck
the
ground
a
little
below
them
ha
so
the
rogues
are
awake
cried
kasim
i
beseech
you
my
lord
to
turn
back
and
not
to
expose
yourself
to
danger
your
slave
will
lead
the
way
and
send
these
infidels
to
inshalla
cried
the
sultaun
yielding
to
the
solicitations
of
all
around
him
and
retiring
a
few
paces
inshalla
many
will
see
the
angel
of
death
ere
night
on
with
ye
victory
is
alla
yar
and
set
on
them
think
that
ye
fight
for
the
faith
and
that
your
sultaun
is
beholding
your
deeds
of
alla
yar
deen
deen
was
now
shouted
by
the
hoarse
voices
of
the
crowd
which
occupied
the
top
of
the
rock
and
the
cry
flew
from
division
to
division
down
the
pass
and
into
the
plain
thousands
shouted
alla
yar
alla
yar
the
sultaun
s
and
strained
every
nerve
to
press
onwards
the
shout
of
the
army
was
answered
by
several
single
shots
from
the
same
spot
as
before
and
an
officer
of
the
regular
infantry
who
had
been
standing
on
the
very
brink
of
the
precipitous
rock
was
seen
to
toss
his
arms
wildly
into
the
air
and
ere
he
could
be
caught
by
several
who
rushed
to
his
assistance
had
fallen
headlong
into
the
thicket
below
follow
kasim
ali
patél
cried
the
daring
young
he
was
the
foremost
and
the
path
was
not
at
first
apparent
to
the
rest
drawing
his
sword
and
putting
his
arm
through
the
loops
of
his
shield
he
dashed
down
it
followed
by
a
hundred
of
those
who
waited
the
signal
of
attack
they
scrambled
down
the
side
of
the
declivity
on
to
the
was
nothing
that
could
be
called
a
path
for
it
was
still
so
dusk
that
objects
could
but
ill
be
discerned
once
on
the
wall
however
all
was
fair
before
them
the
parapet
was
broad
enough
for
three
or
four
men
to
pass
abreast
but
kasim
and
the
rest
were
obliged
to
wait
a
while
ere
they
were
joined
by
a
sufficient
number
to
press
on
we
shall
have
hot
work
ere
long
said
the
officer
who
had
accompanied
kasim
and
this
is
no
place
for
infantry
to
fight
narrow
wall
with
a
deep
ditch
on
the
one
hand
and
a
thick
jungle
with
only
a
narrow
path
through
it
on
the
other
by
alla
i
like
it
art
thou
a
coward
said
kasim
turning
on
him
with
some
contempt
in
his
voice
thou
hadst
better
in
that
case
go
to
the
rear
fie
on
thee
to
speak
thus
do
we
not
eat
the
sultaun
s
salt
come
on
in
the
name
of
the
prophet
there
are
enough
of
are
coming
every
moment
and
the
top
of
the
rock
is
already
thou
shalt
see
i
am
no
coward
cried
the
officer
darting
forward
but
he
was
stopped
by
another
deadly
shot
and
fell
on
his
face
without
uttering
a
word
or
cry
his
fate
did
not
however
check
the
assault
alla
yar
alla
yar
was
still
the
shout
and
the
whole
body
hurried
on
impelled
forward
by
the
pressure
from
the
rear
there
was
no
retreating
on
the
one
hand
was
the
impassable
ditch
on
the
other
the
and
there
open
and
with
paths
through
it
running
parallel
to
the
wall
by
which
many
rapidly
advanced
they
saw
nothing
of
the
defenders
though
from
time
to
time
a
fatal
shot
struck
the
dense
mass
and
one
of
their
number
fell
headlong
from
the
narrow
path
or
sinking
down
wounded
was
thrown
over
by
his
comrades
the
thick
jungle
hid
the
defenders
of
the
wall
who
retreated
as
the
others
advanced
for
they
were
as
yet
too
few
to
offer
any
resistance
but
gradually
the
noise
of
the
shouting
and
firing
was
heard
along
the
line
of
wall
and
its
defenders
hurried
along
to
the
right
to
meet
their
enemies
judging
that
their
flank
had
been
turned
and
that
there
was
little
hope
of
retaining
their
post
if
the
sultaun
s
army
should
succeed
in
advancing
in
this
manner
parties
joined
together
and
gradually
succeeded
in
arresting
the
rapid
approach
of
their
enemies
who
had
now
to
fight
for
every
foot
of
ground
tower
after
tower
was
desperately
disputed
the
day
was
advancing
many
of
the
men
were
already
exhausted
by
their
long
night
march
and
to
stop
or
retreat
was
impossible
at
this
rate
we
shall
never
reach
the
gate
cried
the
sultaun
who
had
entered
a
tower
which
had
just
been
taken
and
where
kasim
and
many
others
were
taking
breath
for
an
instant
ere
they
recommenced
their
advance
we
shall
never
gain
the
must
now
be
nearly
three
coss
from
us
and
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
those
assembled
and
the
men
are
very
weary
said
kasim
for
he
spoke
boldly
ya
alla
kureem
exclaimed
the
sultaun
dost
despair
kasim
ali
alla
forbid
was
his
reply
by
the
favour
of
the
prophet
we
shall
prevail
but
my
lord
sees
that
it
is
tedious
work
for
the
kafirs
have
heard
the
firing
and
are
collecting
more
and
more
in
every
tower
and
though
they
pay
dearly
for
their
temerity
in
resisting
the
power
of
the
lion
of
the
faith
as
these
unblessed
bodies
testify
yet
the
taking
of
every
succeeding
tower
is
a
work
of
more
labour
and
many
of
the
faithful
have
tasted
of
a
thought
strikes
me
said
the
sultaun
what
if
the
wall
were
thrown
down
we
should
then
possess
a
breach
by
which
we
could
enter
or
go
out
at
a
wise
thought
excellent
advice
what
great
wisdom
was
repeated
by
the
whole
circle
while
the
sultaun
stood
by
silent
apparently
in
further
consideration
upon
the
subject
yes
he
continued
after
holding
his
forefinger
between
his
teeth
in
an
attitude
of
deliberation
for
some
time
yes
it
is
a
good
thought
and
we
charge
you
syud
he
added
to
his
relative
with
its
execution
collect
the
pioneers
heave
over
the
battlements
into
the
ditch
fill
it
up
level
with
the
plain
inshalla
there
will
be
a
broad
road
soon
be
quick
about
it
and
now
sirs
let
us
lose
no
more
time
but
press
on
our
swords
are
hardly
red
with
the
blood
of
the
infidels
and
they
appear
to
be
collecting
yonder
in
some
but
said
the
syud
this
is
a
pioneer
s
work
in
the
name
of
the
prophet
leave
me
not
with
i
have
spoken
replied
the
sultaun
frowning
enough
see
my
command
obeyed
and
be
quick
about
we
may
need
the
road
too
soon
said
a
voice
but
although
they
tried
hard
they
could
not
discover
whose
it
was
once
more
then
they
resolutely
set
forward
and
the
sultaun
was
on
foot
among
his
men
who
were
full
of
animation
as
he
often
spoke
to
them
and
reminded
them
that
those
who
fell
were
martyrs
who
would
be
translated
to
paradise
and
those
who
survived
would
win
honour
and
renown
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
tired
and
exhausted
as
they
were
the
men
had
not
their
first
spirit
and
some
hours
of
constant
fighting
with
no
water
to
refresh
them
had
been
more
than
they
could
support
the
opposition
every
moment
became
more
and
more
certain
and
effective
and
each
step
was
disputed
meanwhile
the
road
over
the
ditch
progressed
but
slowly
the
syud
had
thought
himself
offended
by
being
left
behind
to
see
it
done
and
looked
sulkily
on
without
attempting
to
hasten
the
operation
the
pioneers
were
too
few
to
effect
anything
rapidly
indeed
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
have
done
what
the
sultaun
had
ordered
even
had
the
whole
force
joined
in
the
work
for
the
ditch
was
wide
and
deep
full
of
thorns
briars
matted
creepers
and
bamboos
which
had
been
planted
on
purpose
to
offer
a
hindrance
to
an
enemy
a
few
stones
only
had
been
displaced
though
the
work
had
gone
on
nearly
an
hour
when
it
was
suddenly
and
rudely
interrupted
the
advancing
party
had
proceeded
hardly
with
much
labour
when
on
a
turn
of
the
wall
they
perceived
a
square
building
filled
with
the
enemy
who
in
considerable
numbers
had
taken
post
there
and
were
evidently
determined
to
dispute
it
hotly
ah
had
we
now
some
of
my
good
guns
cried
the
sultaun
as
he
beheld
their
preparations
for
defence
we
would
soon
dislodge
those
unblessed
kafirs
by
alla
they
have
a
gun
too
there
must
be
some
one
yonder
who
understands
fighting
better
than
those
we
have
yet
may
their
mothers
be
defiled
cried
a
gasconading
commander
of
a
battalion
of
infantry
who
was
well
known
for
his
boasting
who
are
they
that
dare
oppose
us
my
men
are
fresh
for
they
had
just
come
up
from
the
rear
and
if
i
am
ordered
i
will
go
and
bring
the
fellow
s
head
who
is
pointing
the
gun
ameen
said
the
sultaun
quietly
be
it
hast
stir
not
thou
kasim
ali
but
remain
here
we
may
require
the
officer
addressed
his
men
for
a
few
moments
formed
them
as
compactly
as
he
could
on
the
narrow
wall
and
placing
himself
at
their
head
with
loud
cries
of
alla
yar
they
dashed
on
followed
by
many
who
had
collected
during
the
pause
those
in
the
enclosure
reserved
their
fire
till
they
were
near
they
have
no
ammunition
cried
the
sultaun
ya
ya
nathur
wullee
i
vow
a
covering
for
both
your
tombs
if
they
take
the
but
as
he
made
the
invocation
they
saw
for
all
were
looking
from
the
tower
where
they
had
stayed
in
intense
eagerness
one
of
the
men
inside
the
enclosure
lift
a
match
to
the
gun
and
apply
it
would
not
ignite
ya
cried
kasim
snatching
a
matchlock
from
a
fellow
who
stood
near
and
aiming
it
is
a
long
shot
but
bismilla
and
he
fired
the
man
was
raising
his
hand
again
when
the
shot
struck
him
he
fell
back
into
the
arms
of
those
behind
him
another
for
the
sake
of
the
prophet
or
it
will
be
too
late
cried
kasim
not
heeding
the
cries
of
shabash
shabash
which
all
poured
forth
it
was
indeed
too
late
the
success
of
the
first
shot
had
gained
the
advancing
party
a
moment
but
ere
he
could
be
sure
of
his
aim
a
second
time
the
fatal
match
was
applied
and
with
the
explosion
half
of
the
leading
division
fell
as
one
man
may
perdition
light
on
them
cried
the
sultaun
in
agony
may
hell
be
their
portion
my
men
waver
too
ya
kubeer
ya
alla
kureem
support
mahomed
the
infidels
but
his
wild
invocations
were
of
no
use
the
commander
of
the
party
had
fallen
and
the
men
having
fired
a
volley
at
random
turned
and
fled
as
hastily
as
they
could
on
that
narrow
crowded
way
cowards
exclaimed
kasim
ah
had
i
here
fifty
of
the
youth
of
my
country
and
their
good
we
would
see
whether
we
were
to
eat
this
the
sultaun
was
speechless
with
rage
for
some
moments
order
on
the
next
corps
he
shouted
at
last
that
unworthy
one
shall
be
disgraced
before
my
very
eyes
to
behave
thus
do
not
stay
to
fire
he
cried
to
its
commander
who
came
up
upon
them
with
the
steel
were
ye
english
ye
would
carry
the
are
of
the
true
faith
will
ye
not
fight
better
ya
karwa

ya

grant

your
let
me
head
this
attack
cried
kasim
for
others
appeared
to
hang
back
on
my
head
and
eyes
be
will
carry
the
place
or
die
in
the
effort
remain
here
exclaimed
the
sultaun
fiercely
art
thou
too
rebellious
remain
and
shoot
if
thou
wilt
we
may
need
thee
let
them
go
whose
duty
it
jo
hookum
exclaimed
the
officer
who
had
been
addressed
i
will
either
carry
it
or
again
the
advance
was
made
while
those
in
the
tower
kept
up
an
incessant
fire
the
sultaun
himself
aiming
frequently
but
they
had
now
to
face
men
emboldened
by
success
the
division
was
allowed
to
advance
nearly
to
the
same
place
as
the
former
had
done
and
again
the
fatal
cannon
loaded
almost
to
the
muzzle
with
grape
was
fired
a
loud
shout
from
the
enemy
followed
the
execution
was
terrible
the
survivors
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
turned
and
fled
leaving
a
heap
of
mangled
and
writhing
forms
between
them
and
the
enemy
at
this
moment
too
a
body
of
men
from
an
eminence
on
the
flank
who
had
hitherto
been
concealed
poured
in
a
destructive
volley
which
added
to
the
terror
the
retreating
body
met
another
which
was
hurrying
on
to
their
assistance
and
the
confusion
became
irretrievable
blows
and
were
even
exchanged
on
the
narrow
wall
and
many
a
man
fell
wounded
or
maimed
by
the
hands
of
his
while
only
the
powerful
could
keep
possession
of
the
passage
on
a
sudden
arose
a
cry
of
the
road
the
road
and
as
if
the
means
of
escape
were
thus
open
the
whole
for
a
great
distance
down
the
wall
turned
and
fled
the
sultaun
saw
the
action
it
was
in
vain
that
he
tore
his
hair
threw
his
turban
on
the
ground
raved
swore
implored
the
assistance
of
the
prophet
and
all
the
saints
in
one
breath
and
in
the
next
wildly
invoked
the
vengeance
of
heaven
upon
his
coward
army
it
was
in
vain
that
he
threw
himself
accompanied
by
kasim
and
his
personal
attendants
into
the
crowd
and
upon
the
narrow
path
strove
to
withstand
the
torrent
which
poured
backwards
it
was
in
vain
that
he
till
he
was
hoarse
his
voice
was
lost
in
the
mighty
hubbub
in
the
cries
of
thousands
the
oaths
the
groans
and
rattle
of
musketry
from
behind
it
was
in
vain
that
drawing
his
sword
in
despair
he
cut
fiercely
at
and
desperately
wounded
many
of
the
fugitives
and
implored
those
around
him
to
do
the
same
he
was
at
last
overpowered
and
accompanied
by
kasim
and
a
few
of
the
strongest
of
his
slaves
he
was
borne
on
with
the
crowd
no
one
heeded
him
in
the
he
had
lost
his
turban
by
which
he
was
usually
known
and
he
became
undistinguishable
to
his
soldiery
from
one
of
themselves
thus
it
was
that
the
throwing
down
of
the
wall
was
interrupted
the
cry
from
the
multitude
by
the
advancing
troops
rose
almost
instantaneously
upon
the
air
with
a
deafening
sound
the
road
the
road
all
shouted
and
hurried
to
where
they
expected
to
have
seen
it
completed
the
narrow
stream
met
from
two
opposite
directions
pouring
on
urged
by
the
energy
of
despair
from
behind
the
two
extremes
met
there
was
no
time
for
a
second
those
who
were
first
had
hardly
looked
into
the
ditch
and
seen
there
only
a
heap
of
stones
instead
of
a
road
and
those
thirty
feet
below
them
ere
with
one
wild
cry
to
alla
they
were
pushed
into
it
by
those
behind
whose
turn
was
to
come
next
a
few
there
of
desperate
clung
to
the
battlements
with
the
tenacity
of
despair
a
few
who
drawing
their
swords
turned
and
tried
to
cut
their
way
through
the
mass
vain
effort
force
was
met
by
force
for
the
danger
was
not
perceived
till
the
men
were
on
the
brink
and
were
pushed
over
those
in
the
rear
thought
they
had
escaped
and
no
warning
cry
was
heard
or
if
heard
attended
to
or
understood
the
multitude
poured
on
ten
thousand
men
had
to
pass
by
that
place
those
who
leaped
lay
at
the
bottom
many
maimed
others
crushed
and
entangled
amidst
the
thorny
briars
and
thick
grasses
the
mass
at
the
bottom
of
the
ditch
gradually
increased
and
a
road
arose
not
of
the
ruins
of
the
wall
but
a
mass
of
human
bodies
those
uppermost
struggling
in
agony
for
life
those
underneath
already
at
rest
in
quiet
foundation
for
the
superincumbent
structure
the
sultaun
and
his
companions
were
hurried
on
kasim
had
a
dread
of
what
he
should
sickening
feeling
as
the
shrieks
and
imprecations
which
arose
from
that
horrible
spot
fell
upon
his
ear
as
they
approached
they
could
do
nothing
however
for
to
turn
was
impossible
to
leap
from
the
walls
into
the
midst
of
the
enemy
would
have
been
death
for
they
pursued
the
flying
army
with
exulting
shouts
and
pressed
close
upon
the
flanks
and
rear
with
their
long
spears
by
the
road
there
was
a
chance
of
chance
that
was
clung
to
as
a
reality
at
that
moment
they
reached
the
brink
way
for
the
sultaun
aid
the
sultaun
rescue
your
king
shouted
kasim
with
his
utmost
energy
while
he
dealt
blows
right
and
left
as
did
also
the
others
with
him
to
stay
the
crowd
even
for
an
instant
the
sultaun
looked
down
on
the
horrible
heap
which
wildly
agitated
was
heaving
with
the
convulsions
of
those
beneath
it
he
appeared
to
turn
sick
and
stagger
and
kasim
observed
it
for
your
life
cried
he
lall
khan
and
some
more
of
ye
keep
together
or
he
is
lost
now
leap
with
me
and
as
the
sultaun
still
hesitated
kasim
seized
him
by
the
arm
and
threw
himself
from
the
brink
now
began
a
fresh
for
life
or
death
in
which
only
the
strongest
prevailed
for
an
instant
kasim
was
stunned
by
the
shock
but
he
saw
lall
khan
trying
to
help
on
the
sultaun
whose
features
wore
the
hue
of
despair
and
he
made
a
mighty
effort
to
aid
him
the
footing
upon
the
heaving
mass
was
unsteady
and
insecure
in
the
wild
despair
of
death
the
struggling
beings
below
clung
to
the
legs
of
those
above
them
and
thus
the
weak
were
drawn
down
to
destruction
but
kasim
ali
and
those
who
followed
him
were
powerful
men
and
raising
the
almost
senseless
body
of
the
sultaun
in
their
arms
and
spurning
many
a
feeble
and
exhausted
wretch
beneath
their
feet
they
bore
it
with
immense
exertions
across
the
ditch
there
remained
however
the
counterscarp
to
surmount
here
many
a
man
who
had
passed
across
the
ditch
failed
to
ascend
for
it
was
of
rock
and
so
rugged
and
inclining
inwards
as
to
afford
no
footing
it
was
vain
attempting
to
raise
the
sultaun
to
the
top
without
he
made
some
exertion
and
kasim
shouted
his
danger
in
his
ear
while
he
pointed
to
the
place
the
sultaun
at
last
comprehended
the
peril
and
being
raised
by
kasim
and
the
others
on
the
shoulders
of
the
tallest
of
his
slaves
he
twice
essayed
to
mount
the
bank
and
twice
fell
back
among
the
writhing
and
crushed
wretches
at
the
foot
upon
whom
they
were
standing
the
second
time
he
was
raised
he
was
evidently
much
hurt
and
could
not
stand
what
was
to
be
done
motioning
to
the
to
speak
was
mounted
by
their
aid
to
the
top
and
the
sultaun
being
once
more
lifted
was
received
by
the
young
man
who
supported
him
a
few
steps
and
then
laying
him
down
groaning
heavily
he
flew
to
the
rescue
of
those
who
had
so
nobly
aided
him
one
by
one
they
had
ascended
by
his
and
their
mutual
aid
and
the
generous
fellow
had
stretched
his
hand
to
several
despairing
wretches
who
were
weak
with
their
efforts
and
previous
fatigue
and
rescued
them
from
death
when
seeing
the
enemy
now
lining
the
wall
and
about
to
fire
upon
the
bank
opposite
to
where
he
stood
he
turned
away
in
order
to
remove
the
sultaun
who
still
lay
where
he
had
placed
him
out
of
danger
he
had
gone
but
a
few
paces
when
he
heard
a
sharp
discharge
of
matchlocks
and
felt
a
cold
stinging
pain
in
his
shoulder
and
all
down
his
back
the
next
instant
a
deadly
sickness
which
precluded
thought
overpowered
his
faculties
and
he
sank
to
the
ground
in
utter
insensibility
chapter
xxxii
while
the
principal
division
of
the
army
was
displaying
its
choicest
manœuvres
in
front
of
the
gate
of
the
wall
now
and
then
venturing
within
shot
and
giving
and
receiving
a
distant
volley
the
noise
of
the
firing
came
faintly
to
those
engaged
and
as
it
was
expected
caused
no
sensation
except
of
anxiety
for
the
moment
when
their
victorious
sultaun
should
arrive
driving
before
him
the
infidel
defenders
and
when
the
gates
should
be
opened
and
the
mass
of
cavalry
should
rush
in
to
complete
their
rout
and
destruction
many
a
man
there
anticipated
the
pleasure
of
slaughtering
the
flying
foe
of
hunting
them
like
wild
beasts
of
the
fierce
gratifications
of
lust
and
unchecked
plunder
but
hours
passed
and
no
victorious
army
appeared
the
defenders
of
the
fort
called
to
them
to
come
on
with
insulting
gestures
and
obscene
abuse
and
shook
their
swords
and
matchlocks
at
them
in
defiance
this
was
hardly
to
be
borne
and
yet
they
who
mocked
them
were
beyond
their
reach
at
length
as
they
looked
several
horsemen
approached
them
with
desperate
speed
their
horses
panting
with
fatigue
and
heat
the
khan
and
many
others
rode
to
meet
them
ya
alla
kureem
cried
all
what
news
where
are
the
army
and
the
sultaun
why
do
you
look
so
wildly
alas
answered
one
who
was
well
known
to
the
khan
as
a
leader
of
note
the
army
is
defeated
and
we
much
fear
the
sultaun
is
lost
he
was
in
the
van
leading
on
the
attack
with
syud
sahib
hussein
ali
bakir
sahib
and
the
young
patél
who
was
fighting
we
heard
like
a
tiger
when
alla
only
knows
how
the
army
took
a
panic
and
and
you
were
within
the
walls
cried
many
voices
we
were
and
had
marched
some
miles
alas
it
would
have
been
better
had
we
never
and
how
did
you
escape
the
ditch
was
already
filled
with
our
companions
said
the
horseman
and
we
scrambled
over
their
bodies
i
found
a
horse
near
and
have
ridden
for
my
life
to
tell
the
they
asked
no
more
questions
and
each
looked
at
his
fellow
with
silent
shame
and
vexation
that
this
should
have
been
the
end
of
all
their
hopes
one
by
one
the
leaders
drew
off
and
in
a
short
time
division
after
division
left
the
ground
and
returned
towards
the
camp
a
few
only
daring
to
meet
the
discomfited
host
which
soon
began
to
pour
by
hundreds
into
it
exhausted
humbled
full
of
shame
and
mortification
among
the
first
was
the
sultaun
for
the
elephants
had
at
a
little
distance
kept
a
parallel
line
with
the
wall
one
was
easily
procured
for
him
and
having
been
lifted
upon
it
he
was
rapidly
borne
to
the
camp
but
he
was
unattended
and
arrived
at
his
tents
almost
unknown
and
unobserved
but
the
loud
nagara
soon
sounded
and
men
knew
that
he
was
safe
and
though
it
was
the
signal
that
the
durbar
was
open
and
that
he
expected
their
presence
few
went
to
him
or
cared
to
meet
him
in
the
temper
which
they
knew
must
possess
him
the
khan
was
among
the
first
who
entered
his
low
salaam
was
almost
disregarded
and
he
took
his
seat
pitying
the
sultaun
s
shame
and
mortification
which
was
fully
expressed
on
his
sullen
countenance
one
by
one
however
the
leaders
of
the
divisions
which
had
remained
behind
entered
and
took
their
places
in
silence
none
dared
to
speak
and
the
restless
eyes
of
the
monarch
the
whites
of
which
were
yellow
and
bloodshot
wandered
from
one
to
another
round
the
assembly
as
if
searching
for
some
pretext
to
break
forth
into
the
rage
which
evidently
possessed
him
and
which
was
augmented
by
the
pain
of
the
sprain
of
his
ankle
there
was
a
dead
silence
so
unusual
in
his
durbar
and
the
words
which
were
spoken
by
the
attendants
to
one
another
were
uttered
in
a
whisper
now
and
then
the
sultaun
rubbed
his
ankle
impatiently
and
knit
his
brows
when
a
severe
paroxysm
of
pain
passed
through
it
or
else
he
sat
silent
looking
round
and
round
bravest
of
those
present
used
to
say
afterwards
that
they
waited
to
see
who
would
be
first
sacrificed
to
his
vengeance
the
silence
was
insupportable
at
last
nedeem
khan
his
favourite
and
chief
flatterer
ventured
to
speak
may
alla
and
the
prophet
ease
the
pain
thou
art
suffering
o
sultaun
he
said
can
your
slave
do
aught
to
relieve
it
oh
rare
bravery
to
speak
cried
the
sultaun
with
bitterness
thou
wert
not
with
me
nedeem
khan
to
partake
of
the
abomination
we
have
eaten
this
day
at
the
hands
of
our
own
friends
and
those
infidel
their
ends
be
damnation
no
thou
didst
volunteer
to
be
with
the
division
without
the
gate
that
thy
fine
clothes
and
fine
horse
might
be
seen
by
the
defenders
of
the
wall
verily
thy
destiny
is
great
that
thou
wert
not
among
that
crowd
nor
struggling
with
that
heap
pah
where
is
kasim
ali
patél
he
continued
after
a
pause
why
is
he
not
present
and
lall
khan
also
kasim
ali
jemadar
huzrut
cried
lall
khan
advancing
has
not
been
seen
not
been
seen
thundered
the
sultaun
attempting
to
rise
and
sinking
back
in
pain
not
been
seen
and
thou
to
tell
me
this
oh
kumbukht
by
alla
lall
khan
hadst
thou
not
too
aided
me
thou
shouldest
have
been
scourged
till
the
skin
was
cut
from
thy
back
begone
thou
and
thy
him
dead
or
alive
and
bring
him
hither
to
asylum
of
the
world
he
lies
if
he
be
killed
among
the
dead
upon
the
edge
of
the
ditch
and
the
enemy
is
in
possession
of
the
walls
begone
roared
the
sultaun
if
he
was
in
hell
thou
shouldest
bring
him
begone
thou
art
a
coward
lall
huzrut
said
the
old
khan
rising
and
joining
his
hands
hardly
able
to
speak
for
his
grief
was
choking
him
if
your
slave
has
his
dismissal
he
will
accompany
lall
khan
in
search
he
could
not
finish
the
speech
and
the
big
tears
rolled
down
his
rough
visage
upon
his
beard
go
rhyman
khan
said
the
sultaun
evidently
touched
by
his
emotion
may
you
be
and
again
he
relapsed
into
silence
as
the
two
officers
departed
on
their
almost
hopeless
errand
the
tiger
will
have
blood
ere
he
is
pacified
whispered
bakir
sahib
who
had
arrived
and
now
sat
near
nedeem
i
pray
alla
it
may
be
none
of
this
assembly
will
they
find
kasim
ali
asked
the
other
willa
alum
responded
his
friend
i
think
not
but
he
will
be
no
loss
to
what
is
this
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
noise
without
and
suddenly
a
man
evidently
a
hindoo
rushed
into
the
assembly
crying
out
daad
daad
daad
and
advancing
threw
himself
on
the
ground
and
lay
at
full
length
motionless
before
the
sultaun
footnote
complaint
what
ho
furashes
chobdars
roared
the
sultaun
his
face
quivering
with
rage
what
is
this
defiled
father
of
abomination
were
ye
asleep
to
allow
our
durbar
to
be
polluted
by
his
presence
who
and
what
art
thou
he
cried
to
the
trembling
wretch
who
had
been
roughly
raised
by
the
furashes
speak
art
thou
drunk
you
are
my
father
and
are
my
are
my
god
cried
the
man
i
am
a
poor
brahmin
i
am
not

been
have
been
beaten
by
a
devil
they
call
jaffar
sahib
he
seeks
my
life
and
i
have
fled
to
your
throne
for
thou
shalt
have
it
said
the
sultaun
quietly
with
his
low
chuckling
laugh
which
not
even
his
officers
could
listen
to
without
feeling
their
blood
curdle
thou
shalt
have
it
away
with
him
furashes
he
cried
raising
his
shrill
voice
away
with
him
i
see
an
elephant
yonder
chain
him
to
its
foot
and
let
him
be
dragged
to
and
fro
before
the
place
he
has
the
wretched
man
listened
wildly
to
his
could
not
understand
it
he
looked
on
the
sultaun
with
a
trembling
smile
and
then
with
a
feigned
laugh
round
the
assembly
nought
met
his
eye
but
stern
and
inexorable
faces
there
were
many
who
felt
the
horrible
injustice
of
the
act
but
none
pitied
the
fate
of
the
brahmin
after
the
event
of
the
morning
do
ye
not
hear
cried
the
sultaun
again
and
ere
he
could
say
a
word
the
brahmin
was
borne
shrieking
out
of
the
tent
all
listened
fearfully
and
soon
they
heard
the
shrill
scream
of
the
elephant
as
after
the
wretched
man
had
been
bound
to
his
foot
the
noble
and
was
old
unwillingly
goaded
into
a
desperate
run
and
dashing
forward
soon
put
an
end
to
his
sufferings
they
looked
and
saw
something
apparently
without
form
jerked
along
at
the
end
of
a
chain
by
the
foot
of
the
elephant
at
every
step
he
took
in
the
rapid
pace
into
which
he
had
been
urged
the
durbar
is
closed
said
the
sultaun
after
a
time
during
which
he
had
not
spoken
but
continued
moodily
to
watch
the
door
of
the
tent
for
the
elephant
as
it
passed
to
and
fro
ye
have
your
dismissal
sirs
we
would
be
they
were
glad
to
escape
from
his
presence
i
said
how
it
would
be
khan
said
bakir
sahib
as
they
passed
out
alla
knows
what
would
have
happened
if
that
brahmin
had
not
rushed
alla
knows
said
the
other
i
trembled
for
myself
for
he
was
savage
to
me
after
all
it
was
the
brahmin
s
was
could
have
averted
it
the
glaring
day
waned
fast
kasim
had
been
wounded
about
and
still
lay
near
the
same
spot
enduring
almost
insufferable
agony
at
first
he
had
been
insensible
but
when
he
recovered
and
was
enabled
to
look
around
him
the
place
was
deserted
except
by
a
few
of
the
enemy
at
a
distance
who
were
busily
employed
in
stripping
the
dead
and
wounded
of
their
arms
and
clothes
he
found
his
sword
his
shield
and
daggers
were
gone
turban
and
waistband
and
upper
garment
also
his
head
and
his
body
were
bare
for
they
had
thought
him
dead
and
the
fierce
rays
of
the
burning
sun
descended
in
unmitigated
fury
upon
him
increasing
to
an
agonising
degree
the
torment
of
thirst
water
water
he
cried
to
those
whom
he
saw
afar
off
water
for
the
sake
of
your
mothers
and
your
children
ye
suffer
me
to
die
alas
they
heard
him
not
they
were
too
busy
in
their
work
of
plunder
and
if
they
had
it
would
have
been
only
to
return
and
with
a
thrust
of
a
spear
or
a
sword
to
have
ended
his
sufferings
to
him
death
would
have
been
welcome
for
his
agony
was
past
enduring
and
he
had
no
hope
of
alleviation
till
he
died
but
his
voice
was
too
weak
for
them
to
hear
and
if
he
exerted
it
there
came
a
rush
of
blood
into
his
mouth
which
almost
choked
him
he
tried
to
move
to
drag
himself
under
the
shade
of
a
bush
which
was
at
a
short
distance
it
was
impossible
pain
he
suffered
became
excruciating
and
after
making
several
desperate
but
ineffectual
attempts
he
fainted
this
temporary
oblivion
at
least
brought
absence
from
pain
and
was
welcome
it
did
not
last
and
as
the
returning
poured
through
his
heart
his
agony
of
body
was
renewed
and
thoughts
too
rapid
and
too
vague
to
assume
decisive
weak
delirium
in
which
his
mother
ameena
his
friend
the
sultaun
the
dreadful
passage
of
the
ditch
and
the
heaps
of
struggling
incoherently
mingled
in
wild
confusion
now
his
distempered
fancy
caused
him
to
imagine
that
he
again
bore
on
the
sultaun
his
form
would
seem
to
change
into
ameena
s
and
he
would
shout
his
despair
and
cry
the
of
the
faith
as
he
strove
for
life
and
mastery
among
the
thousands
who
fiercely
struggled
with
him
but
his
fancied
shouts
were
only
low
moans
which
from
time
to
time
escaped
him
as
he
lay
to
all
appearance
dead
and
again
the
thirst
the
heat
and
the
pain
slowly
but
surely
brought
on
ravings
of
battle
and
hot
contest
and
words
of
encouragement
to
those
around
him
defiance
of
the
enemy
with
wild
invocations
of
alla
and
the
prophet
broke
from
his
lips
in
faint
murmurs
though
passionately
uttered
he
thought
them
shouts
but
they
could
scarcely
have
been
heard
by
one
standing
over
him
at
times
the
sweat
poured
from
him
in
streams
or
stood
in
big
drops
on
his
brow
again
his
frame
would
seem
to
dry
up
till
he
thought
it
would
crack
and
burst
in
a
lucid
moment
he
found
he
had
dragged
himself
during
a
paroxysm
of
delirium
under
the
shade
of
the
bush
it
was
grateful
to
him
and
soothed
his
burning
head
and
skin
and
with
the
coolness
came
visions
of
quiet
shady
fountains
whose
ceaseless
plashings
mingling
with
the
gentle
rustling
of
leafy
boughs
were
music
in
his
bubbling
springs
whose
waters
flowed
up
to
his
lips
and
were
dashed
thence
by
malignant
forms
which
his
excited
brain
created
by
turns
despair
and
hope
possessed
him
but
in
his
quiet
moments
he
prayed
to
alla
for
death
for
release
from
suffering
and
from
the
deadly
sickness
caused
by
a
burning
throat
and
loss
of
blood
he
could
feel
that
he
had
been
shot
through
the
body
and
he
wondered
how
it
was
possible
to
retain
life
in
such
a
state
as
often
as
he
looked
for
a
moment
over
the
open
space
he
saw
in
hundreds
the
horrible
birds
of
prey
ravens
and
kites
and
the
filthy
and
powerful
vultures
tearing
the
hardly
cold
bodies
and
disputing
with
each
other
over
their
sickening
banquet
while
others
wheeled
and
screamed
above
them
ready
to
take
the
place
of
any
who
should
be
driven
by
the
rest
from
their
meal
wherever
he
looked
it
was
the
same
there
were
hundreds
of
the
obscene
birds
struggling
scrambling
fighting
with
each
other
while
thousands
of
crows
in
clamorous
and
incessant
flight
hovered
over
alighting
where
chance
threw
in
their
way
a
coveted
morsel
and
now
and
then
some
prying
raven
would
approach
him
with
long
hops
croaking
to
his
fellows
his
keen
black
eye
glistening
brightly
in
anticipation
and
would
hardly
be
scared
away
by
the
faint
gestures
and
cries
of
the
sufferer
the
night
fell
night
which
many
an
one
would
spend
in
luxury
in
the
enjoyment
of
voluptuous
pleasures
surrounded
by
objects
which
enthral
the
senses
lying
upon
the
softest
carpets
while
burning
incense
filled
the
air
with
rich
perfume
and
the
soft
sighs
of
women
and
the
gentle
tinkling
of
their
anklets
sounded
in
their
night
he
would
pass
in
terror
surrounded
by
the
ghastly
forms
of
the
dead
the
sun
sank
in
glory
the
hues
of
the
brilliant
west
faded
dimly
on
his
aching
sight
and
from
the
east
over
the
wooded
hills
the
yellow
moon
arose
dim
at
first
and
seemingly
striving
to
maintain
the
waning
daylight
soon
however
that
faded
away
and
the
melancholy
and
quivering
wail
of
the
brass
horn
and
the
deep
sound
of
the
evening
from
the
wall
showed
that
the
enemy
were
setting
their
the
gorged
birds
of
prey
flapped
their
broad
wings
heavily
in
their
short
flights
to
the
nearest
trees
to
roost
there
till
the
morrow
should
break
enabling
them
to
recommence
their
glutting
and
bloody
feast
they
were
succeeded
by
beasts
of
prey
one
by
one
jackals
issued
from
the
jungle
and
looking
carefully
around
first
one
and
then
another
raised
his
nose
into
the
air
and
as
he
sniffed
the
banquet
sent
forth
a
howl
or
shriek
which
ran
through
the
unfortunate
kasim
s
veins
like
ice
now
he
could
see
many
many
running
to
and
fro
in
the
moon
s
bright
light
and
their
cries
and
screams
increased
fearfully
to
his
excited
and
delirious
his
senses
fled
and
returned
at
place
he
thought
was
the
hell
he
had
read
of
and
the
howls
like
those
of
the
damned
now
stalked
abroad
the
stealthy
wolf
and
the
gaunt
and
fierce
hyæna
mingled
his
horrible
howl
with
those
of
the
innumerable
jackals
which
hurried
on
in
packs
to
the
ditch
and
kasim
could
hear
the
distant
bayings
of
others
as
they
answered
the
invitation
from
afar
how
he
prayed
for
death
had
he
possessed
a
weapon
he
would
have
rid
himself
of
life
but
he
had
to
endure
all
and
he
shrank
into
the
bush
as
far
as
he
could
to
screen
himself
from
the
notice
of
the
wild
animals
lest
he
should
be
torn
in
pieces
by
them
ere
he
was
dead
some
even
came
and
sniffed
at
him
and
their
bright
and
wild
eyes
glared
upon
him
but
seeing
that
he
yet
lived
they
passed
on
to
where
in
the
ditch
carcases
lay
in
heaps
inviting
them
to
feast
on
a
sudden
while
he
lay
in
utter
despair
he
thought
he
heard
the
clashing
sound
of
an
elephant
s
bells
and
the
peculiar
and
monotonous
cry
of
could
it
be
or
was
it
only
a
mockery
of
his
senses
such
as
had
raised
water
to
his
lips
and
spread
before
him
delicious
and
juicy
fruits
he
listened
in
fearful
suspense
he
did
not
hear
it
for
a
time
and
hope
which
had
arisen
strong
within
him
was
dying
away
when
it
came
again
on
the
soft
night
breeze
that
had
just
arisen
and
he
could
hear
it
clearly
above
the
yells
and
howls
of
the
beasts
around
him
who
were
fighting
savagely
over
the
dead
alla
how
he
panted
as
the
welcome
sound
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
how
his
spirit
sank
within
him
as
he
thought
it
might
only
be
travellers
by
some
he
knew
not
of
now
his
faculties
were
all
sharply
alive
had
he
possessed
the
power
of
motion
how
gladly
would
he
have
hurried
to
meet
them
he
tried
to
move
to
raise
himself
and
fell
back
helpless
alas
he
said
aloud
it
is
but
a
delusion
they
will
pass
me
and
the
light
of
morning
will
never
shine
on
kasim
ali
his
own
voice
seemed
awful
in
the
solitude
but
he
could
speak
now
although
very
faintly
and
if
they
passed
near
him
he
was
determined
to
exert
his
utmost
energy
in
one
cry
should
it
even
be
his
last
effort
a
horse
s
neigh
now
rang
shrill
and
clear
in
the
distance
and
the
clash
of
the
elephant
s
bells
became
more
and
more
distinct
they
were
coming
were
surely
for
it
was
the
the
sultaun
had
thought
of
tumultuous
were
his
thoughts
now
he
even
thought
he
could
hear
voices
and
presently
there
was
another
loud
snorting
neigh
for
the
horses
had
smelt
the
dead
afar
off
he
crawled
out
from
his
and
looked
with
intense
expectation
there
was
a
twinkling
light
far
away
among
the
jungle
it
blazed
up
ya
alla
kureem
it
is
a
come
they
come
cried
the
poor
fellow
he
heard
a
confused
sound
of
voices
for
the
yells
of
the
beasts
had
ceased
he
could
see
many
slinking
off
into
the
thickets
and
there
was
perfect
silence
now
the
red
light
illumined
the
trees
at
a
little
were
descending
one
side
of
a
hollow
towards
could
track
their
progress
by
the
light
upon
the
lost
it
for
a
time
as
they
ascended
the
other
it
gleamed
brightly
and
on
a
sudden
burst
like
a
meteor
upon
his
glance
as
the
body
of
men
with
several
torches
the
elephant
the
palankeen
and
some
horsemen
appeared
for
a
moment
on
an
open
spot
pressing
towards
him
he
could
not
be
mistaken
but
kasim
now
dreaded
lest
the
garrison
should
make
a
sally
over
the
ditch
he
looked
was
dark
but
in
the
distance
a
few
lights
on
the
wall
were
hurrying
to
and
fro
as
though
the
alarm
was
given
and
a
shrill
blast
of
the
collery
horn
was
borne
to
his
ear
they
will
not
come
he
thought
and
thought
truly
they
would
not
have
dared
to
face
the
ghastly
spectacle
in
the
ditch
the
voices
were
real
and
the
lights
were
but
a
short
distance
from
him
the
party
had
stopped
to
consult
and
the
poor
fellow
s
heart
beat
wildly
with
suspense
lest
they
should
advance
no
further
he
could
not
hear
what
they
said
but
on
a
sudden
a
cry
arose
from
several
kasim
ali
kasim
ali
ho
which
resounded
far
and
wide
among
the
still
jungle
he
strove
to
repeat
it
but
the
blood
gushed
into
his
throat
he
fell
back
in
despair
they
came
nearer
and
nearer
shouting
his
name
it
was
near
this
spot
said
one
i
am
sure
of
it
for
here
is
a
corpse
and
here
another
let
us
look
and
they
continued
to
track
the
way
of
the
fugitives
by
the
dead
kasim
ali
kasim
ali
ho
hote
shouted
a
voice
which
thrilled
to
kasim
s
very
soul
for
it
was
the
khan
s
how
well
he
knew
angel
s
would
have
been
less
welcome
one
was
advancing
hardly
fifty
paces
from
him
he
waited
an
instant
then
summoning
his
resolution
ho
hote
he
cried
with
all
his
remaining
power
the
sound
was
very
faint
but
it
was
heard
some
one
answered
shouted
the
where
for
the
sake
of
alla
cried
the
khan
from
his
horse
yonder
in
quick
run
was
the
reply
and
all
hurried
on
looking
to
the
right
and
left
kasim
could
not
speak
but
he
waved
his
arm
as
they
came
close
to
him
the
broad
glare
of
the
torch
fell
on
him
and
he
was
seen
all
rushed
towards
him
and
the
old
khan
throwing
himself
recklessly
from
his
horse
ran
eagerly
to
his
side
and
gazed
in
his
face
kasim
s
eye
was
dim
and
his
face
and
body
were
covered
with
blood
but
the
features
were
well
known
to
him
and
the
old
soldier
unable
to
repress
his
emotion
fell
on
his
knees
beside
him
and
raising
his
clasped
hands
wept
aloud
he
cried
at
last
when
he
could
speak
he

friends

i
vow
a
gift
to
thee
o

kasim
had
clasped
the
khan
s
hand
and
was
endeavouring
to
raise
it
to
his
lips
no

motioned
to
his

said
filling
a
cup
with
the
sparkling
and
cool
fluid
bismilla
drink
the
fevered
kasim
clutched
it
as
though
it
had
contained
the
water
of
paradise
cup
after
cup
was
given
him
and
he
was
refreshed
the
flower
of
life
which
had
well
nigh
withered
was
revived
once
more
and
hope
again
sprang
up
in
his
breast
go
on
with
easy
steps
cried
the
khan
to
the
bearers
i
will
give
you
a
sheep
if
ye
carry
him
well
and
on
our
head
and
eyes
be
it
said
the
chief
of
the
bearers
and
they
set
forward
the
men
on
the
wall
fired
a
few
random
shots
at
the
party
but
they
were
too
distant
to
aim
with
effect
and
it
proceeded
rapidly
the
journey
of
some
miles
was
a
severe
trial
to
the
exhausted
kasim
and
they
were
several
times
obliged
to
rest
but
they
reached
the
summit
of
the
last
declivity
after
some
hours
and
the
welcome
sight
of
the
huge
camp
below
the
white
tents
gleaming
brightly
in
the
moonlight
among
which
hundreds
of
watchfires
were
sparkling
greeted
the
longing
eyes
of
kasim
in
a
few
minutes
more
they
had
arrived
at
the
khan
s
own
tent
and
he
was
lifted
from
the
palankeen
into
the
interior
and
laid
on
a
soft
bedding
which
had
been
prepared
within
the
place
was
cleared
of
those
who
had
crowded
round
and
although
kasim
s
eyes
were
dizzy
and
the
tent
reeled
before
him
he
was
conscious
that
the
gentle
voices
which
were
around
him
the
shrouded
forms
which
knelt
by
him
and
the
soft
hands
which
washed
the
hard
and
clotted
blood
from
him
were
those
of
ameena
s
women
chapter
xxxiii
the
excitement
of
the
day
had
prevented
the
sultaun
from
feeling
the
pain
of
the
severe
sprain
until
late
when
it
became
insupportable
in
vain
it
was
fomented
and
rubbed
that
seemed
only
to
increase
the
swelling
and
stiffness
but
when
he
heard
that
kasim
had
arrived
in
the
camp
badly
wounded
he
could
not
withstand
the
desire
of
seeing
him
to
whom
he
owed
the
preservation
of
his
life
accordingly
he
was
lifted
into
a
chair
and
entirely
unattended
directed
his
bearers
to
carry
him
to
the
khan
s
tent
where
he
sent
orders
for
his
chief
physician
to
meet
him
such
an
honour
was
entirely
unlooked
for
by
the
khan
and
his
household
nevertheless
he
was
received
with
respect
carried
into
the
tent
where
kasim
was
and
set
down
by
the
side
of
the
sufferer
who
lay
almost
in
a
state
of
insensibility
showing
consciousness
only
at
intervals
the
women
servants
who
had
been
fomenting
the
wound
and
had
arisen
at
his
entrance
now
resumed
their
occupation
for
though
daood
and
his
other
men
had
offered
their
services
the
khan
had
thought
truly
that
there
was
more
lightness
and
softness
in
the
hand
of
woman
and
ameena
s
nurse
meeran
had
set
the
example
to
the
rest
aided
by
the
instructions
of
her
brother
zoolficar
who
was
busy
preparing
a
poultice
of
herbs
for
the
wound
the
sultaun
regarded
kasim
intently
before
he
spoke
to
the
khan
and
several
times
stooping
down
felt
his
pulse
and
head
inshalla
he
will
yet
live
he
said
we
the
chosen
of
the
prophet
are
counted
to
have
much
skill
in
the
treatment
of
wounds
and
therefore
we
say
inshalla
he
will
live
his
pulse
is
strong
and
firm
and
he
is
not
going
to
alla
forbid
echoed
all
around
whose
advice
hast
thou
got
for
him
khan
asked
the
sultaun
none
as
yet
asylum
of
the
world
my
khanum
s
women
here
have
been
fomenting
the
wound
and
a
slave
of
mine
who
has
skill
in
such
matters
for
he
was
a
barber
once
is
preparing
a
we
desire
to
know
what
is
in
it
said
the
sultaun
there
is
much
in
having
lucky
herbs
boiled
under
the
influence
of
salutary
planets
send
for
the
replies
of
zoolficar
were
deemed
satisfactory
by
the
sultaun
who
desired
him
to
proceed
with
the
work
the
hukeem
too
shortly
afterwards
attended
and
began
carefully
to
examine
the
patient
he
had
evidently
but
little
hope
and
shook
his
head
with
a
melancholy
air
when
he
had
made
his
survey
there
is
no
hope
of
his
life
said
the
old
man
i
have
seen
many
shot
but
a
man
never
survived
such
a
liver
is
pierced
and
he
must
i
tell
thee
no
said
the
sultaun
we
have
had
dreams
about
him
of
late
his
destiny
we
know
is
linked
with
our
own
and
we
are
we
shall
yet
see
him
on
said
the
hukeem
in
him
alone
is
the
power
and
we
will
do
what
we
can
to
aid
any
merciful
interference
he
may
but
his
directions
for
an
application
were
little
different
from
the
mixture
of
the
cook
which
was
shortly
afterwards
applied
the
sultaun
waited
a
while
in
the
hope
of
hearing
kasim
speak
but
he
continued
to
lie
breathing
heavily
and
slightly
groaning
when
additional
pain
caused
a
pang
we
can
do
no
good
he
said
to
the
khan
let
us
leave
him
to
the
care
of
alla
who
will
restore
him
to
us
if
it
be
his
destiny
come
then
with
me
to
the
morning
durbar
we
will
summon
the
leaders
and
settle
some
plan
for
the
future
which
we
were
too
disturbed
to
arrange
the
khan
followed
him
charging
the
women
strictly
with
the
care
of
the
poor
sufferer
until
he
returned
he
was
soon
afterwards
engaged
in
deliberation
with
the
sultaun
and
his
officers
one
of
two
alternatives
presented
themselves
to
tippoo
either
to
abandon
the
undertaking
suddenly
and
while
the
english
should
think
him
engaged
there
to
fall
upon
their
territory
with
fire
and
sword
to
send
for
heavy
guns
from
seringapatam
and
breach
the
barrier
when
an
assault
such
as
could
not
be
withstood
by
the
besieged
might
be
made
with
success
the
latter
was
in
the
end
adopted
the
army
serving
in
malabar
was
desired
to
join
the
sultaun
by
long
forced
marches
heavy
batteries
of
guns
were
ordered
directly
from
the
city
and
his
officers
from
his
manner
and
the
eagerness
with
which
he
entered
into
the
matter
saw
how
intent
he
was
on
providing
for
the
emergency
the
pain
tippoo
had
suffered
the
whole
night
was
intense
but
the
excitement
of
the
durbar
the
dictation
of
the
letters
to
his
officers
and
the
deliberation
had
prevented
him
from
betraying
it
more
than
by
an
impatient
gesture
or
oath
at
last
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
sank
back
upon
his
musnud
cursing
terribly
the
infidels
who
had
caused
his
defeat
and
suffering
but
he
rallied
again
immediately
and
started
up
to
a
sitting
posture
while
he
exposed
and
pointed
to
his
ankle
which
he
had
hitherto
kept
concealed
under
a
shawl
ye
see
what
pain
and
grief
are
devouring
us
he
cried
and
we
call
upon
ye
to
revenge
we
are
our
head
and
eyes
be
it
cried
all
for
every
throb
of
pain
continued
the
sultaun
speaking
in
suppressed
rage
from
between
his
closed
teeth
while
he
held
his
ankle
we
will
have
a
kafir
s
life
we
will
hunt
them
like
beasts
we
will
utterly
despoil
their
country
ya
alla
mousoof
we
swear
before
thee
and
this
company
that
we
will
resent
this
affront
upon
thy
people
to
the
we
will
not
leave
this
camp
pressing
as
are
our
necessities
elsewhere
till
we
have
sent
thousands
of
these
kafirs
to
perdition
and
ye
are
witness
my
friends
of
and
i
swear
to
aid
thee
o
sultaun
cried
the
khan
with
enthusiasm
and
to
revenge
that
poor
boy
if
he
and
i
and
i
cried
all
as
they
started
to
their
feet
in
the
wild
spirit
of
the
moment
the
kafirs
shall
be
utterly
i
am
satisfied
now
cried
the
sultaun
what
has
happened
was
the
will
of
alla
and
was
whatever
a
man
s
fate
is
that
he
must
suffer
and
the
assembly
assented
by
a
general
ameen
however
inshalla
he
continued
we
have
seen
the
last
reverse
and
we
are
assured
by
comforting
thoughts
that
the
army
of
the
faith
will
be
henceforth
victorious
ye
have
your
dismissal
now
for
we
are
in
much
pain
and
would
consult
our
during
the
absence
of
the
khan
the
attentions
of
the
women
to
poor
kasim
had
been
incessant
and
everything
was
done
that
kindness
could
suggest
to
procure
any
alleviation
of
his
pain
his
wound
was
fomented
his
limbs
kneaded
his
still
parched
and
fevered
lips
moistened
with
cool
sherbet
meeran
had
striven
to
comfort
her
young
mistress
for
some
time
but
in
vain
she
had
not
been
able
to
repress
her
emotions
when
he
was
brought
in
wounded
although
she
dared
not
in
presence
of
her
lord
give
full
vent
to
her
feelings
but
when
she
knew
that
he
had
left
the
tent
with
the
sultaun
she
could
no
longer
restrain
herself
and
gave
way
to
a
burst
of
grief
which
would
have
proved
to
meeran
had
she
not
before
known
of
her
love
for
him
how
deep
and
true
it
was
i
must
see
him
meeran
she
said
at
length
the
khan
is
gone
now
and
canst
thou
not
devise
some
means
quick
think
and
act
i
will
send
away
the
women
my
rose
shalt
see
him
said
the
attendant
when
i
cough
slightly
do
thou
come
in
they
say
he
can
not
speak
and
lies
with
his
eyes
ya
alla
kureem
cried
ameena
what
if
he
should
die
ere
i
see
him
oh
grant
him
life
wilt
not
take
one
so
young
and
so
brave
quick
good
nurse
i
am
sick
at
heart
with
meeran
found
but
little
difficulty
in
sending
away
the
women
upon
some
trifling
errands
for
kasim
slept
or
appeared
to
dose
so
taking
their
place
by
his
side
she
coughed
slightly
and
ameena
who
had
been
waiting
anxiously
behind
the
screen
which
divided
the
tents
withdrew
it
hastily
and
entered
she
advanced
with
a
throbbing
heart
she
could
hardly
support
herself
as
well
from
her
despair
of
his
life
as
of
her
own
feelings
of
love
for
him
which
would
now
brook
no
control
her
mind
was
a
chaos
of
thoughts
in
which
that
of
his
death
and
her
own
misery
were
the
most
prominent
and
most
wretched
nor
was
the
sight
before
her
as
she
drew
near
kasim
at
all
calculated
to
allay
her
fears
he
lay
to
all
appearance
dead
his
eyes
were
closed
and
his
breathing
was
so
slight
that
it
scarcely
disturbed
the
sheet
which
was
thrown
over
him
the
ruddy
brown
of
his
features
had
changed
to
a
hue
and
his
eyes
were
sunken
ameena
was
more
shocked
than
she
had
anticipated
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
could
prevent
herself
from
falling
to
the
ground
when
she
first
saw
his
features
so
deadly
was
the
sickness
which
seemed
to
strike
at
her
heart
but
she
rallied
after
an
instant
of
irresolution
and
advancing
sat
down
by
her
nurse
who
gently
fanned
the
sleeper
he
sleeps
she
whispered
zoolficar
has
bound
up
the
wound
his
remedies
are
always
sure
and
there
is
luck
with
his
hand
alla
kureem
i
have
alas
i
have
none
unna
said
ameena
i
can
not
look
on
those
altered
features
and
hope
holy
alla
see
how
he
looks
will
happen
and
she
gasped
in
dread
and
put
her
hand
before
her
eyes
it
was
my
life
but
a
slight
spasm
some
pain
he
felt
in
his
asleep
or
perchance
a
dream
but
it
is
past
look
again
he
is
smiling
his
features
were
indeed
pleasant
to
behold
even
in
a
few
minutes
a
change
had
come
over
them
he
had
been
dreaming
and
the
excitement
and
pain
of
one
had
been
followed
as
is
often
the
case
by
another
of
an
opposite
of
those
delirious
visions
of
gardens
and
fountains
which
had
mocked
him
as
he
lay
on
the
again
arose
before
him
and
he
fancied
that
ameena
was
beside
him
and
they
roamed
together
they
saw
his
lips
moving
as
though
he
were
speaking
yet
no
sound
came
except
an
indistinct
muttering
but
ameena
whose
whole
soul
was
wrapt
in
watching
him
fancied
that
the
motion
of
his
lips
expressed
her
name
and
mingled
emotions
of
joy
and
shame
struggled
within
her
for
mastery
again
the
peaceful
vision
had
passed
away
and
his
brow
contracted
his
nervous
arms
were
raised
above
the
covering
over
him
and
his
hands
were
firmly
clenched
he
ground
his
teeth
till
the
blood
curdled
in
their
veins
and
his
lips
moved
rapidly
oh
that
i
could
wake
him
unna
said
ameena
that
i
could
soothe
him
with
i
dared
to
speak
to
him
hush
what
does
he
say
water
water
whispered
kasim
hoarsely
the
rest
they
could
not
hear
but
it
was
enough
for
ameena
a
jar
of
cool
sherbet
stood
close
to
her
with
a
trembling
hand
she
poured
out
some
into
the
silver
cup
and
held
it
to
his
lips
she
only
thought
of
his
pain
and
that
she
might
alleviate
it
and
meeran
did
not
prevent
the
action
the
cool
metal
was
grateful
to
kasim
s
dry
and
heated
lips
they
were
partly
open
and
as
she
allowed
a
little
of
the
delicious
beverage
to
find
its
way
into
them
the
frown
from
his
brow
passed
away
the
rigid
muscles
of
his
face
relaxed
and
as
she
softly
strove
to
repeat
the
action
his
eyes
opened
gently
and
gazed
upon
her
for
an
instant
to
his
distempered
fancy
her
beauty
appeared
like
that
of
a
houri
and
he
imagined
that
he
then
tasted
the
cup
of
heavenly
sherbet
with
which
the
faithful
are
welcomed
to
paradise
but
as
he
looked
longer
the
features
became
familiar
to
him
and
the
soft
and
liquid
on
him
with
an
expression
of
sympathy
and
concern
which
they
could
not
conceal
for
an
instant
he
strove
to
ameena
the
name
trembled
on
his
lips
but
he
could
not
utter
it
he
suddenly
raised
himself
up
a
little
and
coughed
it
was
followed
by
a
rush
of
blood
which
seemed
almost
to
choke
him
ameena
could
see
no
more
her
sight
failed
her
and
she
sank
down
beside
him
unconsciously
meeran
however
had
seen
all
she
raised
her
up
and
partly
carrying
partly
supporting
her
led
her
away
while
she
called
to
her
brother
who
stood
at
the
to
watch
to
come
to
kasim
s
assistance
thou
must
keep
a
stouter
heart
within
thee
my
pearl
she
said
to
ameena
after
having
with
much
assiduity
recovered
her
holy
alla
suppose
the
khan
had
come
in
then
when
thou
wert
lying
fainting
beside
would
he
not
have
thought
i
shall
never
be
able
to
let
thee
see
him
again
if
thou
canst
not
be
more
alas
sighed
ameena
i
shall
see
him
but
little
again
his
breath
is
in
his
nostrils
and
there
is
no
hope
this
few
he
will
cease
to
live
and
then
i
shall
have
no
put
thy
trust
in
alla
said
the
nurse
looking
up
devoutly
if
thy
destiny
is
linked
with
his
as
i
firmly
believe
it
is
there
will
be
life
and
many
happy
days
for
you
but
her
words
failed
to
cheer
the
lady
who
wept
unceasingly
and
would
not
be
comforted
days
passed
however
and
kasim
ali
lived
his
spirit
of
life
within
him
would
one
while
appear
to
be
on
the
verge
of
extinction
and
again
it
would
revive
and
enable
him
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
those
by
whom
he
was
tended
it
was
in
vain
that
he
entreated
the
khan
to
allow
him
to
be
removed
to
his
own
tent
his
request
was
unheeded
or
refused
and
he
remained
gradually
he
regained
some
strength
and
with
this
a
power
of
conversing
which
he
was
only
allowed
to
exert
at
intervals
by
the
physicians
and
by
the
kind
old
cook
who
with
the
khan
s
servant
daood
and
ameena
s
nurse
were
his
chief
attendants
as
he
lay
weak
and
emaciated
he
would
love
to
speak
with
meeran
of
her
who
he
knew
had
visited
him
on
the
first
night
of
his
wound
and
to
hear
of
her
anxious
inquiries
after
his
progress
towards
recovery
to
ameena
the
days
passed
slowly
and
painfully
sometimes
when
the
khan
spoke
of
kasim
it
was
with
hope
others
as
if
no
power
on
earth
could
save
him
but
she
believed
her
nurse
more
than
him
for
her
hope
never
failed
and
she
was
assured
by
zoolficar
that
the
crisis
had
passed
favourably
that
all
tendency
to
fever
had
left
him
and
though
his
recovery
would
be
slow
yet
that
it
was
sure
and
on
this
hope
she
lived
day
and
night
her
thoughts
were
filled
with
the
one
subject
and
she
conversed
upon
it
freely
with
the
khan
who
loved
to
speak
of
kasim
without
exciting
any
surprise
in
his
mind
and
often
would
she
steal
softly
on
tiptoe
to
the
place
where
kasim
lay
asleep
at
such
times
as
she
knew
he
was
attended
only
by
meeran
and
looking
upon
his
wasted
features
to
satisfy
herself
that
he
was
advancing
towards
recovery
she
would
put
up
a
fervent
prayer
that
it
might
be
speedy
but
kasim
knew
not
of
these
visits
for
ameena
had
strictly
charged
her
nurse
not
to
mention
them
lest
they
should
excite
him
or
he
should
look
for
their
continuance
often
would
the
old
nurse
rally
her
upon
her
caution
and
urge
that
it
would
gratify
kasim
and
aid
his
recovery
to
speak
with
her
but
ameena
was
resolute
i
should
fail
in
my
purpose
she
would
say
meeran
i
dare
not
risk
it
to
look
on
him
daily
even
for
an
instant
is
happiness
to
me
which
thou
knowest
not
of
and
such
as
i
may
indulge
in
without
shame
but
to
speak
to
him
knowing
his
feelings
and
mine
would
be
to
approach
the
brink
of
a
giddy
precipice
from
whence
we
might
fall
to
perdition
am
i
not
the
khan
s
wife
he
is
can
not
love
him
meeran
but
i
honour
him
and
while
he
lives
i
will
be
true
to
alla
send
thee
power
my
child
meeran
would
reply
thou
art
but
a
child
it
is
true
but
thou
hast
the
faith
and
honour
of
an
older
woman
and
alla
will
reward
but
it
was
a
sore
temptation
to
ameena
and
as
she
gradually
became
habituated
to
her
silent
and
stealthy
visits
the
thought
rose
up
in
her
heart
that
it
would
be
pleasant
to
sit
by
him
for
a
while
to
watch
his
gentle
and
refreshing
slumbers
even
to
tend
him
as
meeran
and
the
others
did
above
all
to
listen
to
his
converse
but
she
put
these
thoughts
from
her
by
a
violent
effort
and
when
once
conquered
they
returned
with
less
force
nor
did
kasim
occupy
a
less
dangerous
position
but
his
principle
of
honour
was
high
and
experiencing
the
constant
kindness
of
the
khan
shown
daily
in
a
thousand
acts
could
he
plot
against
his
honour
his
passion
had
imperceptibly
given
place
during
his
long
and
great
weakness
to
a
purer
feeling
which
his
best
reflections
and
gratitude
to
his
benefactor
daily
strengthened
weeks
nay
months
passed
kasim
s
recovery
was
slow
and
painful
it
was
long
ere
he
could
even
sit
up
and
speak
without
pain
and
spitting
of
blood
but
as
his
strength
enabled
him
to
do
so
he
was
allowed
to
sit
for
a
while
then
to
crawl
about
a
shadow
of
his
former
self
he
was
pitied
by
all
and
there
was
hardly
a
man
in
that
camp
who
did
not
feel
an
interest
in
the
life
and
recovery
of
the
patél
often
too
would
the
sultaun
visit
him
and
overpower
him
with
thanks
for
his
preservation
and
he
showed
proofs
of
his
gratitude
in
advancing
him
to
higher
rank
and
to
a
place
of
trust
near
his
own
person
but
the
life
of
dull
inaction
that
he
led
was
irksome
to
kasim
ali
the
noise
of
the
cannon
thundered
in
his
ear
and
from
the
khan
s
tent
he
could
see
the
batteries
day
after
day
playing
upon
the
wall
that
had
hitherto
defied
them
there
was
now
a
huge
breach
through
which
the
whole
army
might
have
marched
with
little
chance
of
opposition
the
ditch
became
gradually
filled
up
by
the
rubbish
and
the
fire
of
the
besiegers
was
but
faintly
returned
by
those
within
still
however
at
times
they
showed
a
bold
front
and
often
sallying
forth
would
do
mischief
to
the
advanced
posts
of
the
army
day
after
day
reports
of
the
progress
of
the
siege
the
camp
gossip
the
arrival
of
the
remains
of
that
splendid
embassy
which
the
sultaun
had
sent
to
constantinople
and
the
failure
of
its
purpose
and
the
immense
sums
it
had
cost
were
retailed
to
kasim
by
the
khan
and
others
but
he
was
helpless
and
though
he
longed
again
to
mix
in
the
strife
and
to
strike
a
blow
for
the
faith
the
power
was
denied
him
meanwhile
the
sultaun
had
been
a
severe
sufferer
the
sprain
of
his
foot
was
acutely
painful
and
subsided
only
after
a
tedious
confinement
during
which
his
temper
had
been
more
than
usually
capricious
the
failure
of
his
noble
embassy
to
turkey
the
immense
sum
it
had
cost
him
without
any
equivalent
except
a
letter
of
compliment
from
the
sultaun
of
constantinople
the
true
value
of
which
he
could
justly
continued
preparations
of
the
english
the
mahrattas
and
the
nizam
and
their
united
on
him
with
force
and
occupied
his
thoughts
by
day
and
his
dreams
by
night
he
had
summoned
the
heaviest
of
his
artillery
from
seringapatam
and
in
time
he
had
completed
a
breach
some
hundred
yards
in
extent
which
invited
attack
at
length
it
was
made
opposition
there
was
none
and
the
army
thirsting
for
revenge
and
plunder
poured
upon
the
now
defenceless
territory
of
travancore
impelled
by
a
smarting
sense
of
the
degradation
they
had
suffered
in
the
attack
on
the
wall
and
in
the
subsequent
delay
which
had
occurred
before
the
storming
of
the
breach
the
army
now
gave
itself
up
to
frightful
excesses
the
inhabitants
were
hunted
like
wild
beasts
shot
and
speared
by
the
merciless
women
and
children
destroyed
or
sent
into
a
captivity
to
which
death
would
have
been
preferable
thousands
were
forcibly
made
to
profess
the
faith
and
amidst
the
jeers
of
the
rabble
were
publicly
fed
with
beef
and
forced
to
destroy
cows
which
they
had
hitherto
venerated
but
the
necessities
of
his
position
began
at
length
to
press
hard
upon
the
mind
of
the
sultaun
he
was
far
from
his
capital
in
his
present
condition
he
was
unable
to
strike
a
blow
against
his
enemies
and
though
he
had
endeavoured
to
mislead
the
english
by
plausible
letters
and
protestations
of
undiminished
friendship
yet
he
could
not
disguise
from
himself
that
there
was
a
stern
array
of
preparation
against
him
which
required
to
be
met
by
decisive
and
vigorous
operations
they
shall
kafir
english
exclaimed
in
his
durbar
after
the
receipt
of
a
letter
from
his
capital
which
warned
him
of
danger
they
shall
see
whether
the
lion
of
the
faith
is
to
be
braved
or
not
mashalla
we
have
hitherto
been
victorious
and
the
stars
show
our
position
yet
to
be
firm
our
dreams
continue
good
our
army
is
faithful
and
brave
and
those
who
remember
the
triumphs
of
perambaukum
and
of
bednore
will
yet
strike
a
blow
for
the
these
addresses
were
frequent
and
the
army
was
in
daily
expectation
of
being
ordered
to
return
but
as
yet
it
did
not
move
the
most
sagacious
of
his
officers
however
urged
it
at
last
with
such
force
upon
the
sultaun
s
notice
that
he
could
no
longer
delay
we
must
utterly
destroy
the
wall
he
replied
to
them
then
we
will
and
this
was
done
it
was
a
magnificent
sight
to
see
that
whole
army
headed
by
the
sultaun
himself
advance
to
the
various
positions
upon
the
wall
which
had
been
previously
assigned
for
the

the
sultaun
himself
dressed
in
gorgeous
apparel
and
surrounded
by
his
courtiers
his
chiefs
and
slaves
quitted
his
tent
amidst
a
discharge
of
cannon
which
rent
the

the
sound
of
and
cymbals
and
the
shouts

stood

in

we
must
not
linger
by
the
way
but
at
once
proceed
to
the
city
where
the
army
has
arrived
a
few
days
and
now
there
is
bustle
activity
and
life
where
of
late
all
was
dull
and
spiritless
its
arrival
has
brought
gladness
to
many
but
none
to
her
whom
we
now
introduce
to
the
reader
and

and
twinkling
eyes

terribly
wounded

the
woman
your
slave
watched
for
him
at
the
door
of
his
house
and
pretending
to
be
a
beggar
asked
alms
of
him
in
the
name
of
the
beebee
muriam

ali
of

khan
to
the
durbar
and
as

beheld
him
urging
his
noble
courser
to
curvet
and
bound
before

window
my

to
water
and
as

the
woman
in
a
mock
accent
of
reproof
how
can
you
say
you
a
married
woman
and
if
i
am
married
cried
the
lady
while
her
large
lustrous
eyes
flashed
with
the
sudden
light
of
passion
and
her
bosom
heaved
rapidly
if

noble
his
large
eyes

his
form
is
s

not

into
his
eyes
and
drink
in
the
intoxication
of
this
passion
for

dost
thou
hear
he

he
must
feel
that

my

cried
kummoo
in
a
tone
of
bitter
scorn
were
there
a
thousand
more
perils
than
thou
whose
blood
is
now
cold
canst
see
or
imagine
in
my
path
i
could
see
none
if
thy
heart
burned
as
mine
doth
sozunbee
she
added
after
a
pause
thou
wouldst
think
on
no
wouldst
only
see
a
heaven
of
bliss
at
the
path
between
would
be
all
darkness
and
indifference
to

have
felt
it
said
the
woman
with
a
sigh
thou
yes
beebee
i
thought
no
one
would
have
ever
known
it
but
he
and
i
and
he
long
ago
died
on
the
thou
hast
surprised
me
into
confessing
then
thou
wast
successful
even
so
replied
the
woman
covering
her
burning
face
from
the
earnest
gaze
of
her
mistress
i
was
young
as
thou
art
he
loved
me
and
we
then
by
that
love
by
the
memory
of
that
hour
i
conjure
thee
sozunbee
as
thou
art
a
woman
and
hast
loved
aid
me
in
this
and
my
gratitude
shall
know
no
bounds
aid
me
and
i
will
bless
thee
awake
and
me
or
i
shall
go
mad
i
have
endured
thus
long
without
speaking
and
methinks
as
i
now
speak
my
brain
becomes
hot
and
it
is
harder
to
bear
than
if
i
had
been
i
will
khanum
i
will
cried
the
woman
i
will
do
thy
bidding
and
only
watch
my
opportunity
at
times
he
walks
on
the
northern
rampart
will
meet
him
give
him
these
then
and
thou
needest
not
speak
much
he
is
learned
and
will
understand
them
there
is
a
clove
that
will
tell
him
i
have
long
loved
there
is
a
to
bid
him
reply
quickly
now
begone
come
to
me
when
thou
hast
seen
him
but
not
till
then
i
shall
burn
with
impatience
but
i
can
wait
may
alla
speed
thee
the
woman
took
her
departure
and
kummoo
looking
from
her
lattice
window
watched
her
across
the
large
square
till
she
disappeared
behind
some
buildings
ya
alla
should
he
despise
me
should
he
spurn
me
she
thought
should
but
no
he
will
not
he
is
young
he
will
hear
i
am
beautiful
and
his
blood
will
burn
as
mine
does
now
then
he
shall
know
what
woman
s
love
is
and
we
will
fly
together
whither
i
care
kummoo
sister
said
a
voice
behind
her
at
which
she
started
and
the
blood
rushed
to
her
face
why
hoormut
is
it
thou
how
thou
didst
startle
me
i
no
matter
what
seekest
thou
hast
thou
seen
ameena
since
she
arrived
dost
thou
ask
me
of
one
so
hateful
dost
thou
think
i
would
go
to
seek
her
i
know
thou
wouldst
not
but
i
heard
that
she
had
received
rich
presents
from
the
old
dotard
and
i
went
to
see
them
it
was
true
they
are
holy
prophet
what
are
they
presents
and
we
have
not
even
clothes
fit
to
there
were
shawls
and
brocades
and
jewels
too
returned
hoormut
and
a
goldsmith
sat
in
the
verandah
making
gold
anklets
whose
weight
must
be
immense
i
tell
thee
we
are
fools
to
bear
this
and
to
preserve
a
civil
demeanour
to
them
hast
thou
seen
the
khan
of
late
no
replied
kummoo
we
are
thrown
by
and
neglected
now
for
her
it
was
to
be
expected
that
it
would
come
to
this
when
we
received
her
as
if
she
was
welcome
instead
of
making
the
khan
eat
dirt
as
he
and
yet
thy
mother
counselled
that
it
should
be
she
did
she
thought
that
by
means
of
the
law
we
might
get
rid
of
her
but
it
seems
there
is
no
hope
for
a
man
may
have
four
wives
lawfully
and
this
was
a
regular
marriage
the
khan
has
the
papers
but
my
mother
will
aid
us
trust
me
that
she
loves
me
too
well
not
to
resent
the
insult
which
has
been
offered
me
by
the
prophet
that
should
be
her
palankeen
crossing
the
square
it
may
be
coming
hither
it
is
she
exclaimed
as
she
looked
from
the
window
it
has
stopped
at
the
gate
she
must
have
news
for
us
that
she
comes
out
from
the
old
lady
s
heavy
tread
was
soon
heard
on
the
stairs
and
both
flew
to
meet
her
at
the
door
as
she
entered
she
embraced
both
cordially
and
they
led
her
to
the
seat
of
honour
a
hooka
was
quickly
brought
and
as
soon
as
she
had
taken
breath
she
began
to
smoke
and
to
speak
and
art
thou
well
she
said
to
her
daughter
thou
art
thin
mashalla
time
was
when
thou
wert
fatter
sozun
came
to
me
a
short
time
ago
and
said
thou
wert
so
i
have
come
to
see
i
have
little
to
do
but
eat
vexation
said
kummoo
with
a
pout
have
i
not
a
rival
and
is
not
that
enough
to
make
my
days
unhappy
and
my
nights
sleepless
and
one
who
is
loaded
with
rich
gifts
while
we
are
denied
new
clothes
said
hoormut
joining
in
o
mother
canst
thou
listen
to
our
shame
and
not
aid
us
once
thou
didst
promise
thou
it
is
her
beauty
which
makes
that
old
dotard
fond
of
her
said
kummoo
for
she
has
no
is
like
a
sheep
if
that
were
blighted
he
would
shake
her
off
at
is
there
no
means
of
turning
him
from
her
said
hoormut
drawing
nearer
you
my
mother
once
said
you
had
a
woman
servant
who
was
wise
and
could
command
spells
could
she
not
aid
us
she
is
ill
said
the
old
lady
then
she
was
well
she
was
preparing
the
incantations
necessary
for
her
purpose
when
the
khan
left
this
on
service
they
have
been
neglected
since
then
but
she
may
be
able
to
resume
them
i
will
inquire
of
couldst
thou
not
send
for
her
mother
said
kummoo
she
is
she
may
come
yes
let
the
palankeen
go
and
here
is
my
ring
let
her
know
that
she
is
kummo
hurried
to
the
door
and
dispatched
a
slave
with
the
ring
and
a
message
in
her
mother
s
name
they
soon
heard
the
bearers
depart
not
much
conversation
passed
till
the
return
of
the
palankeen
for
the
subject
was
not
an
agreeable
one
to
any
of
them
and
the
ladies
had
nothing
but
their
own
fancied
insults
and
neglects
to
reflect
upon
at
last
the
palankeen
arrived
and
they
soon
had
the
satisfaction
to
behold
the
old
woman
hobble
into
the
room
supporting
herself
on
a
stick
kummoo
and
the
other
flew
to
assist
her
welcome
mother
cried
both
your
coming
is
happiness
may
your
steps
be
fortunate
alla
kureem
sighed
the
old
woman
as
she
sank
down
on
some
soft
cushions
which
had
been
spread
for
her
alla
kureem
i
bless
the
prophet
and
the
imaums
and
the
spirits
of
good
that
i
am
here
in
safety
it
is
a
fearful
thing
for
one
so
old
to
venture
forth
art
thou
well
she
asked
peering
into
her
face
with
her
yellow
eyes
and
into
hoormut
s
also
who
now
sat
by
her
as
well
as
may
be
mother
said
the
girl
when
i
am
not
loved
nor
honoured
in
my
house
hast
thou
no
charm
to
preserve
the
love
of
to
destroy
a
rival
then
this
is
why
thou
wouldst
see
me
exclaimed
the
old
woman
in
trouble
only
kureena
is
sure
to
be
sent
for
and
consulted
is
it
not
so
thou
knowest
for
my
mother
says
she
has
told
it
you
of
the
shame
the
neglect
the
insult
and
bitterness
which
we
endure
daily
we
have
no
honour
as
are
as
faded
flowers
thrown
aside
for
a
fresh
one
which
he
hath
lately
taken
to
his
thou
art
not
faded
kummoo
said
the
crone
patting
her
cheek
thy
hand
is
soft
and
warm
thine
eye
is
lustrous
and
full
of
fire
thou
art
not
no
mashalla
i
am
not
but
cease
this
trifling
wilt
thou
aid
us
hast
thou
spells
hast
thou
blighting
withering
curses
to
fall
on
one
who
has
despoiled
us
of
our
honour
and
made
us
a
mockery
among
women
ay
alla
knows
joined
in
wherever
i
go
i
am
taunted
with
this
shame
one
tells
me
the
khan
s
new
wife
is
speaks
of
the
magnificent
gifts
she
has
received
and
i
feel
that
i
could
eat
my
very
fingers
for
shame
mother
for
the
sake
of
the
prophet
aid
us
thou
seest
the
strait
they
are
in
kureena
said
kummoo
s
mother
can
they
do
like
me
cried
the
old
woman
in
a
cracked
tone
can
they
keep
fasts
and
do
penances
to
fit
them
for
the
work
to
make
the
spells
sure
can
they
dare
to
be
present
while
these
are
said
in
the
silence
of
the
night
and
when
the
spirits
who
obey
them
are
hovering
near
to
receive
them
the
women
shuddered
superstitious
terror
for
the
moment
asserted
its
full
sway
over
them
but
kummoo
s
was
a
daring
spirit
i
can
mother
she
cried
striking
her
breast
i
dare
to
follow
thee
were
there
a
thousand
devils
in
my
path
so
that
i
had
my
the
woman
peered
into
her
face
i
thought
i
had
been
myself
she
said
but
young
and
ignorant
as
thou
art
of
this
matter
i
should
have
trembled
thou
dost
not
fear
i
know
no
dread
when
i
have
a
purpose
before
me
said
the
lady
proudly
art
thou
thus
minded
inshalla
i
will
do
as
thou
dost
returned
the
other
whither
thou
leadest
i
will
enough
cried
the
crone
can
we
be
alone
here
when
the
time
comes
of
which
i
will
forewarn
ye
we
can
said
kummoo
without
a
chance
of
no
it
will
be
better
done
yonder
at
thy
mother
s
there
all
can
be
it
will
be
less
dangerous
there
said
the
old
lady
thou
canst
do
thy
work
in
the
closet
which
is
off
the
private
room
and
when
shalt
thou
be
ready
in
a
month
perhaps
the
spell
is
a
heavy
one
to
work
and
requires
preparation
and
thought
lest
anything
should
be
omitted
ye
must
send
fatehas
to
the
shrine
feed
fakeers
in
your
presence
eat
cooling
victuals
and
abstain
as
much
as
may
be
from
meat
thus
ye
will
be
prepared
but
on
me
will
fall
the
sore
fast
and
penance
it
is
hard
for
an
old
woman
to
endure
but
ye
are
in
an
evil
strait
and
i
were
ungrateful
for
years
of
protection
from
your
house
and
for
the
salt
i
have
eaten
did
i
refuse
you
my
aid
and
now
bid
me
depart
for
i
have
much
to
do
ere
not
till
you
have
eaten
cried
kummoo
mashalla
are
we
inhospitable
not
a
mouthful
not
a
taste
said
the
old
woman
rising
no
food
must
pass
my
lips
save
what
is
cooked
by
my
own
hands
till
the
spell
is
finished
the
vow
is
upon
me
and
i
must
alla

then
cried
both
the
ladies
leading
her
to
the
door
we
trust
to
thee
mother
do
not
forget
in
a
few
minutes
the
sound
of
the
bearers
was
heard
as
they
rapidly
traversed
the
street
below
them
she
is
as
true
as
a
soldier
s
sword
said
kummoo
s
mother
who
had
been
almost
a
silent
listener
to
the
conversation
she
will
not
disappoint
ye
many
a
time
hath
she
protected
thee
kummoo
from
the
evil
eye
when
it
was
upon
a
time
wrought
a
spell
for
me
by
which
thy
father
s
love
returned
when
i
had
fancied
it
was
grown
cold
and
thou
hast
more
courage
than
ever
i
work
will
be
the
inshalla
said
kummoo
i
feel
as
though
i
had
that
hated
girl
within
my
grasp
and
could
crush
hush
said
her
mother
thou
shouldst
not
hate
i
hate
as
i
love
mother
and
those
who
reject
the
one
provoke
the
other
thou
shouldst
know
me
by
this
her
mother
was
silent
she
knew
well
the
temper
of
her
daughter
and
her
uncontrollable
passions
it
is
their
destiny
she
thought
let
them
work
it
out
i
dare
not
oppose
and
when
the
palankeen
returned
she
took
her
leave
meanwhile
the
object
of
this
unprovoked
hate
was
daily
becoming
more
and
more
precious
to
the
khan
returned
from
active
service
while
his
risala
continued
absent
under
the
command
of
his
two
subordinates
in
the
seclusion
of
the
zenana
he
delighted
to
pass
most
of
his
time
in
ameena
s
company
and
his
sole
study
seemed
to
be
to
provide
for
her
comfort
to
deck
her
with
the
costliest
robes
to
have
jewels
made
for
her
of
extreme
value
to
get
up
entertainments
to
which
the
other
wives
were
sometimes
but
rarely
invited
he
could
not
bear
the
remembrance
of
the
bitter
days
he
had
passed
with
them
when
ameena
in
her
beauty
and
purity
and
mild
and
gentle
disposition
was
before
him
ameena
s
beauty
too
now
appeared
to
increase
daily
for
in
the
cool
and
shady
zenana
her
complexion
had
assumed
a
more
delicate
tint
and
her
skin
become
softer
and
more
polished
it
was
ravishing
to
the
khan
to
behold
her
as
she
moved
about
the
court
of
her
zenana
tending
her
few
flowers
that
bloomed
beside
a
small
fountain
which
always
threw
up
a
tiny
column
of
spray
or
ministering
to
the
wants
of
her
various
favourites
above
her
the
broad
matted
leaves
of
the
plantain
mingled
with
the
lighter
sprays
of
the
and
and
a
huge
threw
its
broad
shadow
over
all
forming
that
refreshing
green
light
so
grateful
to
the
eye
the
walls
of
the
court
were
kept
carefully
and
the
area
spread
with
the
finest
gravel
on
two
sides
there
were
open
rooms
supported
upon
rows
of
pillars
and
arabesque
arches
which
were
carved
and
painted
in
quaint
devices
costly
carpets
were
spread
upon
their
floors
and
in
the
centre
was
placed
a
musnud
covered
with
white
muslin
upon
which
rested
soft
cushions
of
crimson
velvet
on
a
perch
was
a
gorgeous
looree
whose
brilliant
plumage
glittered
in
hues
of
gold
and
blue
and
scarlet
and
there
were
two
or
three
cages
hanging
within
wrapped
round
with
muslin
cloths
and
gaily
decorated
with
coloured
beads
and
bells
from
which
larks
poured
their
merry
song
now
trilling
their
own
joyous
notes
now
imitating
a
hundred
sounds
of
other
birds
with
which
they
had
become
familiar
a
young
gazelle
with
a
collar
of
red
velvet
about
its
neck
with
tiny
bells
sown
to
it
and
fastened
around
its
fore
legs
above
its
knees
frisked
here
and
there
in
merry
play
and
high
above
the
trees
soared
a
number
of
beautiful
pigeons
enjoying
the
bright
and
glowing
sun
and
the
fresh
air
in
which
they
sported
these
were
daily
sights
and
the
khan
would
lie
beholding
ameena
s
graceful
actions
now
and
then
bursting
out
into
a
torrent
of
praise
of
her
beauty
and
now
joining
in
her
tasks
of
feeding
her
birds
or
her
pigeons
or
would
call
them
for
her
when
they
appeared
to
fly
far
away
from
her
gentle
voice
and
their
time
passed
peacefully
on
marked
by
no
occurrence
whereby
they
could
remember
its
continued
stream
of
quiet
pleasure
down
which
the
khan
suffered
himself
to
glide
enjoying
the
peaceful
contrast
to
the
life
of
turmoil
he
had
passed
in
the
camp
the
more
so
as
it
showed
to
him
the
character
of
ameena
in
its
true
light
that
of
domestic
intercourse
freed
from
the
interruption
of
others
kasim
ali
too
was
his
constant
guest
and
companion
his
wound
had
healed
after
tedious
months
of
suffering
long
after
the
army
had
arrived
at
seringapatam
he
was
unable
to
resume
any
duty
or
his
attendance
upon
the
sultaun
and
his
time
was
passed
mostly
in
company
with
the
khan
assisting
him
in
the
business
of
his
risala
writing
letters
for
him
or
examining
his
accounts
he
still
retained
too
the
happiness
of
occasional
intercourse
with
ameena
by
means
of
the
old
servant
and
as
often
as
he
received
fruit
or
any
delicacy
she
thought
acceptable
to
his
weak
condition
the
gift
was
accompanied
by
kind
messages
which
meeran
would
fain
persuade
him
meant
more
than
was
apparent
to
kasim
ali
her
love
was
too
precious
a
thought
to
part
with
easily
and
he
clung
to
it
with
all
the
ardour
of
his
soul
for
he
felt
himself
alone
among
that
host
he
possessed
acquaintances
it
was
true
but
they
were
either
the
wild
and
debauched
characters
of
the
army
whom
he
had
met
now
and
then
on
service
and
in
his
attendance
at
the
durbar
with
whom
he
had
no
congeniality
of
the
friends
of
the
khan
elderly
men
who
looked
on
him
as
a
youth
of
inexperience
and
with
whom
it
would
be
beneath
their
importance
to
associate
but
kasim
was
content
as
it
was
in
the
business
the
khan
provided
for
him
there
was
enough
of
employment
and
his
weak
state
and
constant
ill
health
prevented
him
from
seeking
other
society
day
after
day
he
was
seen
in
the
khan
s
durbar
acting
as
his
secretary
and
fulfilling
the
duties
of
that
important
trust
far
more
efficiently
than
the
mutsuddees
whom
the
khan
had
hitherto
employed
footnote
clerks
we
have
before
mentioned
the
extensive
system
of
peculation
practised
by
jaffar
sahib
of
whom
indeed
we
have
long
lost
sight
but
as
he
was
employed
in
a
different
sphere
from
the
persons
who
belong
to
our
history
we
have
not
thought
it
worth
our
while
to
follow
him
into
his
career
of
oppression
and
spoliation
where
he
revelled
in
all
the
opportunities
of
gratifying
his
worst
passions
nor
was
he
a
singular
instance
in
the
army
of
the
sultaun
bigots
in
faith
zealots
in
the
practice
of
it
there
was
no
greater
enjoyment
to
hundreds
than
the
destruction
of
the
hindoos
in
those
provinces
of
malabar
which
had
gradually
been
driven
into
rebellion
and
afterwards
conquered
by
the
sultaun
as
we
have
already
mentioned
employed
with
a
portion
of
the
risala
he
had
carried
out
to
the
letter
the
instructions
which
the
sultaun
had
personally
communicated
to
him
burn
slay
destroy
convert
were
the
reiterated
orders
and
they
were
literally
obeyed
jaffar
sahib
had
been
with
the
camp
only
for
a
few
days
when
the
storming
of
the
breach
was
expected
and
that
having
taken
place
he
was
sent
with
the
rest
of
his
own
character
to
finish
the
work
in
the
defenceless
territories
of
travancore
but
he
had
at
last
been
withdrawn
from
thence
and
was
now
attached
to
the
large
cavalry
force
which
held
possession
of
the
plain
of
coimbatoor
and
guarded
the
passes
into
the
of
mysore
to
the
jemadar
s
system
of
deception
however
kasim
ali
fancied
he
had
at
length
gained
a
clue
when
it
was
prominently
brought
to
his
notice
by
the
khan
himself
who
much
disturbed
upon
the
subject
one
day
handed
him
a
letter
he
had
received
from
the
bukhshee
of
the
army
who
it
seemed
had
detected
the
false
accounts
the
jemadar
had
furnished
footnote
paymaster
the
worst
of
all
is
said
the
khan
after
they
had
spoken
a
long
while
upon
the
subject
the
demand
which
the
government
will
make
upon
me
for
the
arrears
of
this
peculation
for
it
would
appear
that
it
has
gone
on
for
a
long
for
years
khan
sahib
replied
kasim
here
they
give
you
the
dates
i
think
i
had
better
go
over
to
the
bukhshee
and
get
access
to
the
whole
of
the
accounts
which
have
been
made
out
we
may
perhaps
detect
the
whole
matter
and
trace
it
to
its
a
wise
thought
will
go
with
thee
but
that
the
honour
of
rhyman
khan
is
too
well
known
this
might
brand
me
for
ever
with
they
went
the
khan
was
too
well
known
to
have
such
a
request
refused
and
day
after
day
did
he
with
kasim
and
secretaries
pore
over
the
accounts
sometimes
thinking
they
had
discovered
the
cheat
at
others
almost
despairing
so
cleverly
had
the
matter
been
managed
the
delay
and
consequent
vexation
was
beginning
to
have
a
serious
effect
on
the
khan
when
after
a
day
of
severer
toil
than
usual
kasim
had
no
doubt
remaining
that
the
whole
of
the
papers
had
been
written
by
the
moonshee
whose
disgrace
we
have
mentioned
though
the
handwriting
was
feigned
and
altered
in
all
and
he
mentioned
his
suspicion
to
the
khan
this
seemed
to
throw
a
new
light
upon
the
subject
they
knew
that
the
moonshee
was
still
attached
to
the
person
of
jaffar
sahib
as
a
kind
of
secretary
for
he
could
not
write
himself
and
it
became
a
matter
of
paramount
importance
to
separate
him
if
possible
from
the
jemadar
nor
was
this
difficult
to
manage
a
few
men
of
the
risala
always
remained
with
the
khan
under
the
charge
of
dilawur
ali
duffadar
the
rough
old
soldier
we
have
before
mentioned
he
bore
the
jemadar
no
very
good
will
and
readily
undertook
to
carry
off
the
moonshee
unknown
to
his
protector
and
bring
him
to
the
city
accordingly
he
took
his
departure
the
following
morning
with
six
resolute
fellows
and
by
rapid
marches
soon
gained
the
camp
here
however
it
was
no
easy
task
to
apprehend
the
person
they
sought
for
he
kept
constantly
with
the
jemadar
and
it
was
necessary
he
should
not
know
of
the
proceeding
but
they
succeeded
at
last
the
moonshee
was
decoyed
to
the
outskirts
of
the
camp
by
one
of
the
men
disguised
as
a
fakeer
where
they
were
met
by
the
duffadar
and
his
mounted
party
and
in
spite
of
his
prayers
protestations
and
threats
he
was
carried
rapidly
towards
the
city
the
rage
of
jaffar
sahib
was
excessive
when
he
fancied
himself
deserted
by
his
dependent
no
one
could
tell
how
he
had
disappeared
or
whither
he
had
gone
the
last
known
of
him
was
that
he
had
been
seen
in
the
company
of
a
fakeer
going
in
a
certain
direction
jaffar
sahib
was
seriously
uneasy
at
his
supposed
defection
not
only
because
he
had
now
no
one
on
whom
he
could
depend
to
transact
his
intricate
business
but
because
this
man
knew
more
of
his
secret
transactions
than
he
cared
to
entrust
to
any
one
else
and
which
if
divulged
would
be
his
ruin
the
arrival
of
the
moonshee
was
a
source
of
true
joy
to
the
khan
and
kasim
at
first
as
might
be
expected
he
knew
or
pretended
to
know
nothing
about
the
matter
but
the
suspicion
was
so
strong
against
him
that
the
khan
by
a
short
mode
of
doing
justice
often
practised
in
india
directed
that
no
water
should
be
given
to
him
till
he
confessed
the
whole
the
threat
was
in
the
end
sufficient
the
fellow
held
out
most
vehemently
for
about
a
day
and
then
overcome
by
terror
at
their
determination
and
threats
that
this
was
only
the
commencement
of
his
punishments
declared
he
would
confess
all
and
he
unfolded
secretly
to
the
khan
and
kasim
the
whole
of
the
deceits
which
had
been
practised
from
the
first
every
account
was
gone
through
and
a
fearful
array
of
peculation
registered
against
the
jemadar
who
was
written
to
to
make
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
city
to
answer
the
complaint
against
him
ere
the
messenger
reached
the
camp
however
the
jemadar
had
arrived
at
the
city
for
his
active
emissaries
had
traced
the
arrival
of
dilawur
ali
and
his
party
and
their
sudden
departure
and
it
was
evident
that
they
must
have
carried
off
the
moonshee
chapter
xxxv
the
detection
of
his
long
concealed
and
successful
peculations
was
a
thunderbolt
to
the
jemadar
the
khan
refused
to
see
him
or
to
hear
any
exculpation
he
had
to
urge
and
then
knowing
the
influence
kasim
ali
possessed
with
his
commander
he
sought
him
and
implored
him
to
use
his
influence
with
the
khan
for
pardon
and
for
silence
on
the
subject
he
became
abject
he
even
threw
himself
at
the
young
man
s
feet
and
when
these
failed
offered
him
a
bribe
to
accede
to
his
terms
it
wanted
but
this
to
excite
kasim
ali
s
full
indignation
he
had
despised
the
man
for
his
meanness
but
the
insult
aroused
him
and
he
spurned
the
offer
fiercely
cheat
and
rogue
he
cried
many
a
man
is
whipped
through
the
bazaars
for
less
than
this
inshalla
i
shall
live
to
see
this
done
upon
thee
i
have
not
forgotten
thee
and
thou
art
too
well
known
in
the
army
for
any
good
men
to
feel
regret
at
thy
fate
men
say
that
thou
art
a
devil
and
not
a
man

alla
i
believe
them
begone
wert
thou
the
sultaun
s
son
i
would
spurn
there
was
no
one
near
and
the
jemadar
eyed
kasim
as
the
thought
flashed
into
his
mind
that
a
thrust
of
his
sword
or
dagger
would
silence
him
for
ever
and
that
without
his
aid
the
khan
would
easily
be
persuaded
to
drop
the
prosecution
kasim
was
weak
too
and
might
easily
be
overcome
and
his
hand
stole
to
his
but
the
string
which
secured
it
to
the
scabbard
was
fast
and
he
could
not
draw
it
with
a
muttered
curse
he
clutched
a
long
knife
he
wore
in
his
girdle
and
on
pretence
of
repeating
his
request
advanced
a
step
his
eye
glistened
like
that
of
a
tiger
about
to
spring
another
moment
might
have
been
fatal
to
kasim
ali
but
he
saw
the
action
and
instantly
seizing
his
sword
which
lay
before
him
he
started
to
his
feet
i
see
thy
cowardly
intention
jemadar
he
said
as
yet
i
will
not
draw
this
weapon
which
would
be
polluted
by
a
coward
s
blood
but
advance
one
step
and
by

mayest
say
the

thou
diest
begone
in

name

and

the
coward
attempted
to
stammer
out
an
excuse
to
protest
that
he
had
been
misunderstood
but
he
could
say
nothing
intelligible
and
he
slunk
away

and
mortified
with
deadly
hate
rankling
at
his
heart
and
urging
him
to
revenge
that
i
should
have
been
foiled
by
that
boy
he
said
aloud
as
he
quitted
the
house
that
i
should
have
been
destined
to
devour
such
abomination
that
i
jaffar
sahib
should
have
been
thus
trampled
upon
ya
ali
ya
hoosein
grant
me
power
of
revenge
yea
his
blood
will
hardly
wipe
out
the
insult
i
have
suffered
yes
tell
him
so
he
cried
to
a
woman
who
he
thought
watched
him
tell
him
him
jaffar
sahib
curses
him
and
as
there
is
a
light
in
heaven
will
have
his
revenge
for
what
has
jaffar
sahib
cried
the
woman
rushing
forward
thou
canst
not
be
he
thou
canst
not
be
he
whom
i
thought
dead
years
ago
begone
i
know
thee
not
thou
art
one
of
his
followers
and
i
curse
thee
and
flinging
her
off
for
she
had
clung
to
his
arm
so
violently
that
she
stumbled
against
a
stone
and
fell
he
strode
on
at
a
rapid
pace
she
arose
slowly
and
looked
after
him
as
he
hurried
on
holy
prophet
she
said
as
she
brushed
away
the
dust
and
her
loose
hair
from
her
eyes
it
must
be
he
his
look
when
he
was
excited
his
very
tones
his
name
too
all
are
his
jaffar
sahib
that
name
hath
not
sounded
in
mine
ears
since
we
met
last
when
the
bright
moon
was
above
us
and
the
trees
casting
their
deep
shade
over
us
veiled
that
from
her
prying
glare
which
even
now
shames
me
to
remember
holy
alla
he
did
not
remember
sozun
how
should
he
years
have
passed
since
we
were
young
and
they
have
not
been
without
effect
and
to
meet
thus
when
i
had
thought
him
dead
long
long
ago
and
mourned
him
in
my
heart
ya
alla
what
destiny
is
this
before
me
be
it
what
it
may
she
continued
walking
a
few
paces
i
will
see
him
and
he
shall
know
that
sozun
still
jaffar
sahib
had
but
one
resource
left
and
as
he
hurried
along
his
mind
became
resolutely
bent
upon
attempting
it
to
urge
the
khan
again
was
impossible
and
against
kasim
his
desire
of
revenge
became
more
wild
and
implacable
every
moment
my
only
refuge
is
in
the
sultaun
i
will
go
to
him
and
confess
my
fault
if
i
am
who
shall
dare
to
say
that
the
destiny
of
jaffar
sahib
is
evil
is
no
worse
to
be
apprehended
than
if
i
were
proceeded
against
publicly
i
may
be
fortunate
and
prevent
and
thus
saying
and
meditating
how
he
should
open
his
statement
he
arrived
before
the
gate
of
the
palace
and
entered
it
hastily
being
well
known
no
opposition
was
made
to
him
and
he
passed
on
to
the
appartment
of
those
who
waited
upon
the
sultaun
for
he
well
knew
that
at
that
hour
he
must
be
alone
or
in
consultation
with
purnea
or
kishun
rao
his
advisers
and
ministers
is
the
sultaun
alone
abdool
hoosein
he
said
addressing
the
monarch
s
chief
and
confidential
attendant
who
with
a
crowd
of
others
waited
without
he
is
engaged
in
writing
said
the
functionary
it
would
be
as
much
as
my
life
is
worth
to
disturb
him
this
day
he
has
received
letters
which
have
sorely
distressed
him
and
he
is
not
in
his
right
i
must
see
him
said
the
jemadar
my
business
is
of
the
utmost
you
must
write
then
for
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
mention
it
returned
the
man
doggedly
abdool
hoosein
said
jaffar
sahib
taking
him
aside
thou
knowest
we
have
been
friends
hitherto
and
inshalla
mean
to
continue
so
i
can
not
write
what
i
have
to
would
be
impossible
but
here
is
a
trifle
and
he
slipped
a
gold
coin
into
his
hand
it
is
not
enough
said
the
attendant
glancing
his
eye
from
the
money
to
the
giver
for
he
well
knew
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
it
is
not
it
nay
be
not
hasty
returned
the
other
here
is
more
but
i
have
no
tis
the
worse
for
thee
jaffar
sahib
i
do
not
move
under
three
gold
pieces
and
no
one
else
dares
take
them
then
in
the
name
of
the
shitan
cried
the
jemadar
go
say
that
i
am
here
and
have
a
petition
to
the
sultaun
thinks
thou
art
at
the
camp
said
the
attendant
twas
but
yesterday
he
spoke
of
he
will
soon
know
why
i
am
here
replied
the
jemadar
but
begone
i
have
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
bandy
words
with
the
man
went
and
returned
go
he
said
in
the
name
of
sheikh
suddoo
the
father
of
mischief
i
would
not
be
present
at
your
interview
with
the
sultaun
for
much
away
he
hath
sent
for
how
the
heart
of
the
coward
beat
as
he
heard
these
words
but
there
was
now
no
means
of
retreat
and
he
proceeded
the
sultaun
sat
in
a
small
room
which
communicated
with
the
private
apartments
of
the
palace
the
walls
were
plain
but
the
ceiling
was
richly
painted
and
ornamented
and
the
casements
and
shutters
of
the
windows
also
on
the
floor
there
was
spread
a
clean
white
calico
covering
and
at
one
end
upon
a
carpet
supported
by
cushions
surrounded
by
heaps
of
papers
and
holding
in
his
left
hand
a
stiff
leather
case
which
supported
the
paper
on
which
he
was
writing
sat
the
sultaun
jaffar
sahib
hesitated
for
a
moment
at
the
door
for
he
had
looked
through
a
chink
and
seen
that
there
was
a
frown
on
the
sultaun
s
brow
and
that
peculiar
expression
about
his
mouth
which
was
always
the
precursor
of
mischief
but
there
was
no
time
allowed
him
for
reflection
the
sultaun
had
heard
and
called
to
him
and
the
jemadar
hastily
entering
at
once
threw
himself
at
full
length
flat
on
the
ground
before
him
with
his
arms
and
legs
extended
and
lay
there
motionless
and
silent
why
what
ails
thee
in
the
name
of
the
prophet
speak
and
tell
we
thought
thee
at
the
camp
why
hast
thou
come
here
without
leave
why
hast
thou
transgressed
orders
and
the
regulations
of
our
army
which
were
drawn
up
with
our
own
wisdom
and

perfect

military
knowledge

o
kumbukht

man
without
a

why

the
jemadar
not
daring

look
up

great
and
his
liver
is
turned
to
water
i
crave
forgiveness

there
like

plundered
him
and

my
refuge

the
saints

the
man
rising
up
and
joining

he
trembled

have
no

sahib
silently
made
his
obeisance
and
retired
burning
with
shame
and
anger
and
renewed
threats
against
kasim
the
author
of
all
alone
he
could
have
borne
the
sultaun
s
irony
and
bitter
words
but
that
others
should
know
of
his
detection
and
disgrace
was
more
than
he
could
endure
he
did
not
wait
to
speak
to
those
in
the
but
hurried
at
once
to
his
temporary
lodging
in
the
bazaar
we
have
sent
for
you
my
friends
said
the
sultaun
to
his
ministers
after
a
short
pause
to
advise
with
us
regarding
momentous
affairs
which
press
upon
our
notice
not
that
we
need
by
the
blessing
of
the
prophet
whose
agent
we
are
upon
earth
and
the
favour
of
the
most
high
we
receive
such
intimations
of
our
destiny
in
dreams
and
by
secret
and
holy
communings
with
the
saints
that
our
path
is
clearly
marked
out
for
us
but
there
are
nevertheless
matters
which
we
have
heard
of
within
the
last
few
days
that
disturb
our
rest
the
kafir
feringhees
of
madras
have
written
to
us
and
remonstrated
sharply
for
our
attack
upon
travancore
they
have
the
insolence
to
demand
satisfaction
for
it
and
the
price
of
what
was
destroyed
vain
arrogance
they
should
know
us
better
than
to
think
a
mere
threat
could
disturb
the
ruler
of
the
kingdom
which
alla
hath
given
into
our
hand
they
are
making
mighty
preparations
for
war
they
have
incited
the
kafir
mahrattas
may
their
end
be
perdition
and
the
imbecile
ruler
of
hyderabad
to
join
against
me
nay
be
not
surprised
for
though
these
have
been
the
reports
of
the
bazaars
for
months
yet
we
did
not
believe
them
but
here
are
the
proofs
and
he
handed
to
them
the
letters
he
had
received
containing
the
intelligence
which
they
perused
in
silence
and
now
listen
he
continued
his
mean
features
lighting
up
with
a
sudden
excitement
listen
to
the
revelation
we
have
had
from
alla
himself
these
letters
arrived
but
yesterday
and
as
we
lay
cogitating
upon
their
contents
and
praying
to
alla
to
enable
us
to
devise
some
means
of
extrication
from
the
difficulty
our
eyes
closed
and
we
fell
asleep
soon
however
gorgeous
visions
began
to
crowd
upon
us
and
shapes
of
glory
which
though
almost
indefinite
yet
hovered
around
filling
the
mind
with
wondrous
delight
as
we
looked
we
heard
a
voice
which
said
art
thou
hungry
o
sultaun
and
then
i
bowed
down
and
cried
saying
i
lack
food
o
alla
but
it
is
revenge
for
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
shed
in
thy
cause
and
i
am
hungry
for
aid
that
all
thine
enemies
may
be
subdued
and
the
banner
of
the
faith
float
proudly
over
the
realms
of
hind
even
as
it
did
of
yore
under
the
power
of
delhi
and
then
even
as
i
finished
speaking
three
trays
whose
surface
sparkled
with
the
light
of
heaven
and
upon
which
were

said
eat
o
beloved
of
the

and
thou
wilt
be
able
to
discern
the
hidden

of
this

and
i
ate
and
lo
there
came
light
into
my
heart
and
i
know
that
the
three
trays
of
dates
were
the
dominions
of
the
three
confederates
my
enemies
and
they
were
sweet
to
the
taste
even
as
victory
is
sweet
to
the
ajaib
most
wonderful
most
extraordinary
echoed
the
two
listeners
who
were
provoked
enough
at
this
puerile
harangue
inshalla
there
is
no
fear
cried
the
sultaun
bitterly
fear
no
there
is
no
fear
there
is
joy
that
at
last
we
shall
have
them
in
our
power
in
a
few

the
king
of
the
afghans
will
rise
in
our
favour
and
leagued
with
the
rajah
of
nipaul
and
the
rulers
of
joudhpoor
and
jynuggur
who
shall
be
able
to
withstand
them
the
french
will
rise
with
ten
thousand
men
our
valiant
troops
are
a
lakh
and
more
pressed
on
all
sides
our
enemies
will
fall
and
then
for
revenge
and
plunder
as
he
spoke
his
eyes
flashed
fire
his
action
was
high
and
restless
and
even
that
sedate
counsellor
the
dewan
caught
a
portion
of
his
excitement
upon

as

they
saw
his

change
in

his

contract
his

become
compressed
a
nervous
twitching
of
his

commenced
which
always
expressed
his
violent
agitation
and
they
exchanged
significant

with
each

he
was
no

they
withdrew
with
many
obeisances
and
the
strange
being
was
left
to
his
meditations
and
to
the
wild
visions
of
conquest
which
the
words
of
the
rao
had
resolved
into
matters
apparently
within
his
grasp
jaffar
sahib
reached
his
abode
with
feelings
it
would
be
difficult
to
describe
the
money
was
but
a
trifle
to
him
in
amount
for
in
his
career
of
rapacity
and
plunder
he
had
amassed
thousands
but
it
was
so
lent
out
among
bankers
suttlers
the
men
of
the
risala
and
those
of
the
bazaar
that
he
feared
he
should
hardly
be
able
to
raise
it
in
time
to
meet
the
sultaun
s
demand
and
without
it
he
had
little
hope
that
mercy
would
be
extended
to
him
as
he
dismounted
from
his
horse
his
attendant
madar
met
him
a
woman
is
within
he
said
pointing
to
the
door
of
the
apartment
she
came
here
a
short
while
ago
and
would
take
no
denial
saying
she
would
wait
for
a
woman
in
the
name
of
the
shitan
what
doth
she
want
she
young
and
fair
replied
the
man
grinning
your
worship
will
see
she
is
veiled
from
head
to
most
strange
away
with
ye
all
from
hence
it
may
be
the
matter
is
private
and
we
would
be
as
he
spoke
he
entered
the
door
there
was
a
small
room
at
the
back
of
the
open
shop
he
had
hired
a
door
led
from
that
into
a
small
court
where
was
a
shed
for
cooking
or
bathing
and
a
low
verandah
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
he
opened
the
door
and
looked
around
close
beside
it
in
the
verandah
sat
a
woman
veiled
from
head
to
foot
in
a
thick
sheet
she
appeared
to
be
trembling
violently
for
the
covering
was
much
agitated
who
in
the
name
of
satan
art
thou
cried
the
jemadar
who
comest
at
this
unseasonable
hour
she
did
not
reply
and
he
spoke
again
more
roughly
alla
be
merciful
to
me
jaffar
she
exclaimed
throwing
herself
at
his
feet
and
clasping
his
knees
while
she
cast
the
veil
from
her
it
is
indeed
thou
hast
thou
forgotten
sozun
sozun
sozun
he
repeated
as
he
drew
his
hand
across
his
forehead

risen
from
the
dead
is
this
a

my
features
are
wasted
but
i
am
the
same
thou
didst
spurn
me
a
while
ago
like
a
dog
and
my
heart
was
broken
there
was
kindness
between
us
once
jaffar
and
she
sighed
deeply
i
knew
thee
not
he
said
raising
her
up
and
for
the
moment
yielding
to
a
softer
feeling
caressed
her
i
had
been
maddened
insulted
by
that
dog
of
a
patél
kasim
ali
i
knew
thee
not

dost
thou
know
him
to
my
cost
he
and
his
dotard
patron
rhyman

have
despoiled
me
of
my
character
but
enough
tis
no
affair
of
thine
why
dost
thou
ask
i
have
too
a
reckoning
to
settle
with
him
but
let
it
pass
we
will
speak
of
that
which
once
was
pleasant
to
us
thou
hast
not
forgotten
me
then
jaffar
alla
is
my
but
canst
thou
come
hither
this
night
at
dusk
unobserved
then
we
will
speak
of
past
times
uninterruptedly
now

have
affairs
of
moment
to
settle

the
reply
thy
voice
is
music
in
mine
ears
after
so
long
a
follow

then
and
i
will
dismiss
thee
openly
before
my
servants
but
be

chapter
xxxvi
looking
from
her
latticed
chamber
sat
her
heart
beating
so
that
its
pulsations
seemed
audible
to
her
own
ear
her
bosom
heaving
as
though
it
would
almost
burst
the
bounds
of
the
light
boddice
which
enclosed
it
and
her
eye
flashing
brightly
as
she
thought
upon
the
sure
success
of
her
mission
little
she
heeded
the
soft
and
chastening
light
which
the
moon
s
rays
cast
upon
every
object
around
silvering
the
tall
white
minarets
of
the
mosque
till
they
stood
out
in
perfect
relief
against
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
and
resting
upon
the
sharp
pinnacles
of
the
ancient
temples
where
all
else
was
lost
in
shadow
the
large
courts
around
them
into
which
she
looked
in
the
then
filled
with
busy
throngs
were
now
deserted
save
by
the
broad
giant
shadows
which
the
temple
and
the
trees
around
it
cast
across
them
now
and
then
the
shrouded
form
of
a
brahmin
would
pass
noiselessly
through
them
the
moon
s
light
resting
brightly
upon
the
white
drapery
around
him
but
as
he
hurried
on
the
deep
black
shadow
seemed
to
enshroud
him
and
he
was
no
longer
discernible
within
its
influence
as
kummoo
sat
thus
she
would
idly
speculate
with
vacant
eye
fixed
upon
some
figure
in
the
square
beyond
or
listen
to
the
hoarse
and
distant
noubut
which
as
the
night
advanced
beat
at
the
tomb
of
the
sultaun
s
father
or
to
the
wailing
and
quivering
sound
of
the
brass
horns
which
arose
from
the
camp
when
the
watch
was
being
relieved
she
heeded
not
the
luscious
perfume
of
and
which
loading
the
air
came
in
at
her
open
window
from
the
garden
beneath
but
her
whole
senses
were
absorbed
in
one
object
which
she
rather
wooed
than
strove
to
turn
away
from
her
mental
vision
at
times
too
a
tear
would
fill
her
large
lustrous
eye
and
welling
over
the
lid
trickle
down
her
face
tear
of
burning
soother
to
her
excited
mind
but
rather
aggravating
those
feelings
which
had
now
become
almost
too
painful
to
be
borne
what
can
delay
her
she
said
speaking
half
aloud
to
herself
by
this
time
i
might
have
been
with
him
ya
fatima
aid
me
my
liver
is
burnt
with
passion
and
the
air
which
comes
to
me
seems
with
my
own
breath
i
can
bear
this
no
longer
why
does
she
tarry
is
old
or
she
might
be
dallying
with
him
what
if
she
were
but
no
that
can
not
dared
not
she
knows
well
i
would
tear
her
limb
from
limb
if
she
harboured
even
a
thought
of
his
love
and
she
is
faithful
too
i
must
wait
he
was
away
may
have
been
under
this
roof
where
he
little
dreamed
there
existed
one
whose
greatest
happiness
would
be
to
die
at
his
feet
holy
alla
who
is
that
she
cried
as
a
long
train
of
musing
into
which
she
had
fallen
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
opening
of
her
chamber
door
who
comes
sozunbee
was
the
reply
sozunbee
she
said
while
the
blood
poured
through
her
frame
in
wild
pulsations
and
tis
thou
at
last
hither
quick
quick
sit
here
and
tell
me
all
i
have
long
long
looked
for
thee
why
hast
thou
tarried
i
am
ready
now
come
let
us
thou
dost
not
speak
woman
hast
thou
done
my
bidding
thou
seen
him
not
tell
me
and
i
shall
be
i
am
burning
alla
kureem
burning
and
she
fanned
herself
violently
while
her
articulation
showed
that
her
mouth
was
quite
parched
speak
why
dost
thou
not
speak
i
have
seen
him
was
the
reply
well
oh
for
patience
to
listen
by
alla
thou
canst
never
have
loved
sozunbee
or
thou
wouldst
know
what
it
is
to
have
fire
within
thou
not
quench
it
it
will
be
hard
for
thee
to
hear
all
lady
shall
i
tell
it
thou
sawest
why
dost
thou
hesitate
i
would
spare
thee
pain
go
now
to
rest
thou
wilt
be
calm
pain
what
dost
thou
mean
pain
can
not
she
almost
gasped
in
a
hoarse
whisper
while
her
eyes
flashed
so
that
sozun
could
hardly
bear
their
intense
gaze
he
can
not
have
denied
me
he
dare
not
have
flung
aside
love
like
mine
holy
prophet
sozun
thou
dost
jest
and
she
laughed
wildly
may
the
holy
mother
of
ali
and
the
lady
murium
and
the
saints
aid
thee
my
life
said
the
woman
rising
and
passing
her
hands
over
her
head
to
withdraw
the
evil
from
her
may
they
give
thee
peace
as
i
live
i
saw
him
and
spoke
with
him
but
thou
must
be
calm
ere
i
tell
it
i
am
i
am
quite
calm
she
said
making
a
violent
effort
to
swallow
feel
my
is
can
but
her
hand
belied
her
words
it
burned
as
though
she
were
in
a
fever
and
the
quick
and
strong
pulsations
of
her
blood
were
distinctly
perceptible
to
delay
however
was
but
to
excite
her

corner
of
my
dooputta
and
gave
him
what
thou
hadst
sent

thou
understand
the
tokens
i
asked
beebee
he
looked
sorrowfully
on
them
they
speak
of
love
he
said
why
hast
thou
brought
them
to
one
who
is
dying
she
is
fair
i
most
lovely
her
eyes
are
large
her
lips
are
red
in
beauty
she
is
like
a
rose
when
it
opens
to
meet
the
morning
sun
which
drinks
the
fragrant
dew
from
its
cup
she
has
seen
thee
o
syud
and
her
liver
has
become
what
misfortune
is
around
me
he
said
there
was
no
anger
in
his
tone
but
sorrow
i
have
no
love
now
but
for
one
but
let
that
pass
go
to
her
who
sent
thee
say
i
pity
as
we
have
never
met
and
i
know
her
not
so
let
her
turn
her
thoughts
to
another
she
will
see
many
in
the
he
had
thought
thee
one
of
the
palace
dancers
thou
knowest
they
are
high
and
proud
and
men
account
themselves
fortunate
to
win
a
smile
from
them
i
eagerly
undeceived
him
she
is
no
tuwaif
i
said
she
is
a
householder
and
as
far
above
them
in
beauty
as
the
moon
is
above
a
and
what
said
he
sozun
then
he
grew
grave
my
pearl
and
said
sternly
such
love
is
is
impure
bid
her
forget
it
she
hath
a
am

to
her
why
hath
she
looked
on
me
with
eyes
of
passion

say
to
her
kasim

no
man
of
dishonour
but
pure
and
unstained
as

dissolute
or
debauched
gallant
away

art
an
offence
to
beebee
i
tried
to
speak
he
would
hear
nought

sounded
in
mine
ears
and
his
eyes
were
so
large
and
so
severe
that
i
and
was
this
all
sozun
was
this
all
ah

why
didst
thou
not
say

have
heard
thee
ah
fool
couldst
thou
not
have
pleaded
for
me
in
burning
words
such
as
would
have
inflamed
his
heart
dried
up
the
cold
dew
of
his
virtue
and
turned
him
to
me
with
a
love
as
violent
as
mine
own
couldst
thou
not
have
said
that
i
live
upon
his
look
look
i
had
only
one
which
mine
own
thoughts
have
magnified
into
years
of
thou
not
tell
him
that
i
am
one
who
will
brook
no
control
ya
rehman
alla
couldst
but
he
said
he
loved
another
interrupted
sozun
vainly
endeavouring
to
stem
the
torrent
of
her
mistress
s
words
what
another
o
woman
thou
didst
not
say
didst
not
dare
to
say
it
he
loves
another
then
he
love
if
he
has
loved
another
who
is
she
couldst
thou
discover
her
o
dull
one
a
tuwaif
vile
and
worthless
one
some
scum
of
perdition
no
he
is
too
noble
for
sozun
water
by
alla

choke

the
vessel
thou
saidst
another

very
beautiful
he
hath
saved
her
life
twice
saved
it
they
have
been
in
camps
together
and
he
must
have
met
her
and
dost
thou
not
see
all
sozun
clear
to
thine
eye
as
daylight
does
it
not
all
open
gradually
upon
thee
as
when
the
dawn
of
morning
dispels
the
darkness
objects
that
were
before
dim
and
shadowy
assume
palpable
forms
there
is
suspicion
surely
khanum
but
we
have
never
heard
aught
breathed
against
no
she
hath
been
discreet
but
may
it
not
be
so
i
ask
thee
calmly
when
alla
knows
my
heart
is
on
it
may
enough
enough
we
will
watch
and
she
who
was
born
to
be
my
who
hath
thrown
me
from
my
seat
of
pride
and
intruded
between
me
and
my
perchance
be
rudely
thrown
from
her
elevation
grant
it
o
prophet
o
ye
saints
and
holy
men
grant
it
yes
we
will
watch
now
sozun
wilt
thou
not
aid
me
to
the
enough
then
now
this
hath
calmed
me
somewhat
for
the
while
revenge
is
dimly
seen
in
the
distance
but
it
will
come
it
will
come
now
lie
down
beside
me
and
sleep
the
night
is
far
spent
i
am
weary
of
watching
and
my
heart
aches
alla
keep
thee
lady
returned
the
other
i
will
watch
beside
thee
for
a
while
for
i
feel
not
sleepy
and
the
air
is
and
she
watched
silently
for
her
thoughts
were
busy
with
the
events
of
that
strange
meeting
with
jaffar
his
now
apparently
reckless
character
and
the
threats
he
had
held
out
against
the
young
patél
for
she
had
been
with
him
long
and
if
they
had
not
renewed
the
passionate
love
of
former
years
he
had
caressed
her
and
vowed
to
befriend
the
only
being
for
whom
he
had
ever
felt
affection
the
fresh
breeze
of
night
laden
with
perfume
from
tree
and
flower
poured
in
gentle
whispers
through
the
casement
murmuring
and
sighing
above
it
amidst
the
slender
leaves
of
the
palms
abroad
all
was
still
except
now
and
then
the
bark
of
a
dog
or
the
call
of
the
sentinels
upon
the
walls
to
each
other
that
all
was
well
gradually
the
moon
s
glorious
light
crept
round
to
the
window
and
stealing
into
the
room
it
wandered
over
the
recumbent
figure
of
the
lady
till
it
rested
upon
her
face
she
sleeps
now
thought
sozun
or
the
light
would
disturb
her
peacefully
too
and
oh
how
lovely
her
features
and
those
long
lashes
appear
as
the
light
plays
among
them
and
kisses
them
in
very
wantonness
i
would
he
could
see
her
with
those
glorious
eyes
so
full
of
expression
into
which
no
woman
could
look
without
love
her
fate
is
in
the
power
of
her
destiny
may
it
be
propitious
our
paths
are
dark
and
rugged
before
us
yet
we
must
walk
on
without
a
light
or
a
guide
and
now
i
will
to
rest
also
for
mind
and
body
are
both
men
poured
into
the
fort
from
every
side
the
following
morning
both
officers
and
men
for
the
order
had
gone
forth
for
all
to
hear
the
determination
of
the
sultaun
upon
the
crisis
elephants
and
horses
gay
palankeens
their
bearers
striving
with
each
other
for
precedence
proceeded
to
the
durbar
exerting
their
utmost
speed
with
loud
cries
and
glittering
armour
cloth
of
gold
and
silver
and
the
most
brilliant
silks
satins
and
muslins
shone
in
the
bright
sun
as
the
turbans
the
vests
or
the
scarfs
of
the
wearers
rumour
had
gone
forth
that
the
sultaun
himself
would
proceed
against
the
infidels
and
every
man
was
eager
to
be
led
to
war
and
in
the
one
and
rich
booty
in
the
other
being
his
by
anticipation
crowds
hurried
on
the
hall
of
audience
in
the
palace
had
long
been
filled
and
the
people
reached
from
the
entrance
far
beyond
into
the
courtyard
cries
of
deen
deen
alla
yar
alla
yar
rose
perpetually
from
among
the
mass
and
mingled
with
the
sound
of
the
and
shrill
pipes
which
continued
playing
while
the
durbar
was
open
the
sultaun
was
seated
upon
his
throne
over
which
suspended
by
a
fine
wire
so
as
to
appear
really
to
flutter
over
him
was
hung
a
golden
bird
whose
wings
and
tail
set
with
precious
gems
glittered
as
the
wind
stirred
it
to
and
fro
this
was
the
humma
or
sacred
bird
of
paradise
whose
shadow
so
long
as
it
falls
upon
a
monarch
prevents
his
sustaining
any
injury
and
to
which
many
miraculous
powers
were
ascribed
by
the
lower
order
of
soldiery
or
those
who
had
risen
from
it
around
engaged
in
fanning
him
others
gently
moving
peacocks
feathers
or
tails
of
the
thibet
cow
to
and
fro
to
prevent
the
flies
from
settling
on
a
number
of
fair
and
youthful
creatures
whose
ruddy
or
pale
cheeks
showed
their
origin
to
have
been
in
the
cold
and
distant
climate
of
the
west
they
were
all
dressed
sumptuously
as
women
they
had
been
instructed
in
the
arts
of
music
and
dancing
and
were
thus
held
up
to
the
scorn
of
the
people
generally
who
were
taught
by
frequent
allusions
to
them
that
all
english
were
effeminate
cowards
fit
only
to
be
dressed
as
women
and
to
be
engaged
in
such
frivolous
occupations
some
of
the
boys
were
young
and
had
known
no
other
existence
than
that
debased
slavery
these
took
pride
in
their
gorgeous
dresses
and
moved
about
to
display
them
others
apparently
by
shame
at
their
disgraceful
situation
hung
down
their
heads
and
strove
to
conceal
their
faces
from
the
prying
glances
of
the
spectators
a
miserable
lot
was
theirs
many
of
them
retaining
a
vivid
remembrance
of
their
countrymen
their
faith
and
their
freedom
were
obliged
to
perform
a
routine
of
bitterly
degrading
duties
dancing
and
singing
before
the
sultaun
for
the
amusement
of
the
court
and
although
many
of
the
spectators
pitied
the
poor
boys
and
their
sad
fate
yet
no
one
dared
to
utter
a
word
of
sympathy
in
their
behalf
while
there
were
too
many
who
rejoiced
in
their
abject
condition
seated
near
the
monarch
were
his
sons
three
fine
youths
and
in
double
and
treble
rows
from
the
throne
the
officers
of
the
army
of
the
state
his
own
flatterers
and
sycophants
and
a
host
of
others
as
closely
packed
as
it
was
possible
to
stand
or
sit
from
time
to
time
some
of
the
boys
would
perform
a
dance
before
him
or
a
few
jesters
buffoons
or
actors
exhibit
some
ribald
scene
the
more
their
language
was
indecent
and
keenly
directed
against
the
english
the
more
applause
it
received
from
those
present
particularly
from
the
sultaun
who
encouraged
them
by
words
and
promises
of
liberal
reward
while
shouts
of
laughter
would
resound
through
the
hall
at
any
successful
sally
or
witty
allusion
the
moments
were
however
precious
and
when
the
sultaun
observed
that
the
hall
was
full
the
dancers
and
jesters
were
dismissed
and
silence
commanded
the
order
was
obeyed
and
all
looked
with
impatience
to
hear
the
real
result
of
their
monarch
s
deliberation
in
regard
to
the
matter
of
peace
or
war
which
had
so
long
appeared
to
be
doubtful
for
a
while
he
appeared
to
meditate
then
partly
raising
himself
up
he
selected
a
small
paper
from
among
the
heap
before
him
and
ere
he
read
it
spoke
to
those
immediately
around
him
we
whose
government
is
the
gift
of
alla
he
said
desire
no
concealment
in
our
affairs
therefore
listen
o
ye
faithful
and
my
are
about
to
read
you
a
revelation
which
was
vouchsafed
to
us
last
night
and
which
on
awaking
we
recorded
it
hath
since
pleased
the
author
of
power
to
afford
our
mind
a
clue
to
the
unravelment
of
the
mystery
and
this
too
we
will
unfold
to
you
as
we
lay
asleep
soon
after
midnight
we
thought
we
stood
on
the
shore
of
the
sea
and
afar
off
sailed
many
great
and
powerful
ships
which
bore
the
colours
of
the
english
as
we
looked
behold
a
little
cloud
arose
and
soon
there
was
a
mighty
wind
before
which
all
was
scattered
and
those
who
were
on
the
seashore
awaiting
their
arrival
returned
to
their
homes
dejected
and
dispirited
these
were
the
kafir
feringhees
may
their
graves
be
unblessed
are
helpless
now
and
by
the
favour
of
the
prophet
as
they
have
provoked
a
war
by
their
own
imprudence
and
bad
faith
they
shall
find
that
the
men
of
islam
are
ready
and
willing
to
fight
for
their
we
are
ready
we
are
ready
cried
the
assembly
with
one
voice
lead
us
to
battle
we
are
your
will
fight
with
you
to
the
listen
further
he
continued
there
was
yet
another
vision
more
wonderful
than
the
last
vouchsafed
to
us
which
proves
that
all
those
moosulmans
who
fight
against
us
in
the
armies
of
the
english
become
hogs
when
they
are
stricken
with
they
deserve
are
faithless
and
sin
against
the
holy
prophet
may
his
grave
have
rest
may
their
ends
be
perdition
and
unholy
shouted
many
of
those
who
listened
while
the
rest
cried
a
miracle
a
miracle
that
such
revelations
should
be
made
to
our
father
and
our
sultaun
but
that
was
not
all
continued
tippoo
for
to
prove
his
words
the
angel
withdrew
a
film
from
before
mine
eyes
and
i
beheld
a
most
extraordinary
which
filled
me
with
amazement
before
me
stood
a
man
with
a
hog
s
head
who
when
he
saw
me
advanced
to
meet
me
who
art
thou
i
said
i
am
one
of
the
true
faith
of
islam
he
cried
but
i
no
longer
desire
to
be
called
one
for
i
fought
against
it
under
the
banners
of
the
infidels
and
now
i
suffer
for
my
indiscretion
and
faithlessness
i
am
as
you
see
a
hog
and
these
men
have
all
been
transformed
into
hogs
they
also
were
killed
in
the
various
engagements
with
the
kafirs
we
are
in
the
dreary
land
of
spirits
and
thine
is
permitted
to
hold
communion
with
ours
here
in
order
that
the
glory
of
the
faith
may
be
upheld
and
the
terror
of
our
example
made
known
among
thine
then
methought
all
became
dark
and
dreary
and
a
cold
wind
blew
and
before
us
were
shadowy
objects
which
the
eye
could
not
determine
at
first
but
as
we
looked
upon
the
scene
dim
forms
were
seen
advancing
towards
us
in
lines
even
like
unto
regiments
and
the
spirit
which
had
spoken
to
us
began
to
manœuvre
them
after
the
manner
of
the
english
with
whose
system
it
appeared
to
be
acquainted
but
o
my
friends
as
i
looked
all
had
hogs
faces
and
the
words
of
him
they
obeyed
sounded
like
grunts
in
our
ears
wherefore
we
beseech
you
to
consider
this
thing
and
whether
it
is
better
to
live
and
die
in
a
natural
beloved
and
chosen
of
whether
ye
would
also
be
hogs
and
wallow
in
the
filth
of
your
own
abomination
like
unto
the
christians
and
those
who
serve
them
miracles
miracles
shouted
the
assembly
the
sultaun
is
the
beloved
of
alla
to
him
alone
are
now
revealed
visions
and
wonderful
dreams
for
him
we
will
fight
and
for
the
faith
ay
ye
say
right
cried
tippoo
very
wonderful
are
the
manifestations
of
alla
to
his
servant
therefore
we
shall
this
day
begin
our
march
for
we
have
heard
that
the
kafirs
are
below
the
passes
inshalla
a
few
days
will
bring
us
up
to
them
and
then
we
will
see
whether
their
pride
and
haughtiness
can
not
be
humbled
let
us
therefore
join
together
and
send
these
infidels
to
the
regions
of
perdition
and
if
ye
be
crowned
with
victory
ye
will
be
full
of
honour
and
renown
and
become
the
envy
of
the
world
while
to
those
who
fall
martyrs
in
the
cause
of
islam
hear
what
the
prophet
blessed
be
his
name
hath
promised
they
shall
enter
into
pleasant
places
where
many
rivers
flow
and
curious
fountains
send
forth
most
murmuring
streams
near
which
they
shall
repose
themselves
on
soft
beds
adorned
with
gold
and
precious
stones
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
of
paradise
which
shall
continually
yield
all
manner
of
delicious
fruits
and
they
shall
enjoy
beautiful
women
pure
and
clean
having
black
eyes
and
countenances
always
fresh
and
white
as
polished
pearls
who
shall
love
none
but
themselves
with
whom
they
shall
enjoy
the
perpetual
pleasures
of
love
and
solace
themselves
in
their
company
with
amorous
delights
to
all
eternity
drinking
with
them
most
delicious
liquors
without
ever
being
overcharged
by
them
which
shall
be
administered
by
beautiful
boys
who
shall
be
continually
running
round
their
beds

nay
cheer
thee
beloved
thou
must
be
now
as
thou
wert
ever
wont
to
be
stout
of
heart
and
fearless
for
the
future
said
rhyman
khan
to
his
fair
wife
as
on
the
evening
of
that
day
he
sat
with
her
in
their
quiet
secluded
apartments
with
the
moon
s
broad
light
playing
on
the
slightly
agitated
fountain
before
them
and
the
cool
wind
rustling
amidst
the
leaves
above
their
heads
thou
must
not
fear
what
is
there
to
dread
hast
thou
not
thine
own
nurse
with
thee
and
my
household
who
are
devoted
to
thee
hast
thou
not
these
apartments
where
no
one
dares
to
intrude
without
thine
especial
leave
and
a
guard
of
my
most
faithful
men
around
thee
why
shouldst
thou
fear
my
lord
she
said
looking
up
to
it
was
hard
to
resist
those
pleading
i
know
i
am
not
worthy
to
share
the
fate
of
one
who
is
honoured
in
the
councils
of
the
sultaun
and
who
is
respected
in
the
assemblies
of
the
great
yet
if
thou
art
ill
who
will
tend
thee
like
ameena
if
thou
art
wounded
who
will
soothe
thy
pain
thou
wouldst
have
no
one
to
cheer
thy
dulness
even
the
patél
would
fail
wouldst
think
of
ameena
but
the
english
affect
to
despise
them
but
the
sultaun
well
knows
their
power
though
he
denies
it
to
all
and
scoffs
at
it
i
pray
alla
he
may
feel
it
not
soon
tis
the
english
i
dread
for
thee
fighting
with
them
is
not
like
fighting
with
the
infidel
hindoos
who
are
slaughtered
like
sheep
but
the
war
of
men
against
shock
of
contending
roar
of
rattle
of
musketry
this
thy
gentle
heart
can
not
bid
me
go
before
thee
into
the
me
attend
thee
as
thy
a
turban
on
my
brow
and
a
sword
to
my
waist
and
see
if
ameena
will
not
follow
thee
to
the
death
she
cried
hastily
rising
if
the
mahratta
women
have
done
this
many
a
time
thinkest
thou
that
a
moghul
of
the
old
and
proud
blood
of
delhi
dares
not
a
sudden
cry
of
admiration
broke
from
the
khan
she
had
arisen
from
her
seat
and
advanced
towards
him
her
always
soft
and
loving
eye
was
filled
with
a
daring
and
flashing
light
her
bosom
heaved
and
her
slight
and
beautiful
form
was
drawn
up
to
its
full
height
as
she
stood
almost
panting
when
she
ceased
to
speak
by
alla
and
the
prophet
thou
art
fit
to
be
a
soldier
s
wife
he
cried
starting
to
his
feet
one
who
feels
so
keenly
a
soldier
s
honour
and
his
fame
ought
to
share
it
with
him
i
had
not
thought
that
this
spirit
dwelt
within
thee
come
to
me
thou
needst
not
fear
come
evil
or
good
thou
shalt
share
it
with
rhyman
khan
i
swear
by
thine
eyes
i
will
not
leave
thee
art
thou
content
now
thou
art
too
kind
she
murmured
as
she
bowed
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
thou
knowest
i
have
none
here
but
thyself
and
my
home
is
afar
off
thou
art
father
mother
to
me
i
bless
thee
that
thou
hast
heard
my
prayer
and
that
i
am
not
to
be
left
tormented
by
a
thousand
fears
for
thee
and
dreads
may
they
be
visionary
of
coming
of
evil
ameena
ay
my
lord
hast
thou
not
felt
often
upon
the
eve
of
some
event
in
thy
life
when
as
yet
it
had
not
burst
from
the
womb
of
futurity
an
unknown
undefinable
sense
of
dread
which
pervaded
thy
senses
causing
thought
to
be
painfully
acute
and
to
run
into
a
thousand
channels
too
intricate
to
follow
for
a
moment
till
it
was
lost
in
vague
oppressive
conjecture
leading
to
no
end
never
ameena
i
have
never
troubled
myself
to
think
much
but
have
been
content
to
take
events
as
it
pleased
alla
to
send
i
may
be
wrong
then
she
returned
these
may
be
the
offsprings
of
my
own
imagination
only
and
not
common
to
others
it
is
well
it
is
so
they
are
not
there
will
be
danger
ameena
said
the
khan
who
misapprehended
her
bethink
thee
again
upon
going
with
me
into
the
rough
camp
remember
kasim
ali
will
be
here
and
will
protect
thee
as
he
hath
done
oh
no
no
i
would
not
would
not
stay
with
him
but
go
with
thee
my
noble
lord
she
said
averting
her
burning
face
from
him
for
the
sake
of
the
prophet
do
not
mention
that
again
thou
hast
already
said
thou
wouldst
let
me
accompany
bismilla
then
be
it
so
yet
why
turnest
thou
away
art
thou
angry
that
i
doubted
thy
firmness
i
never
doubted
that
girl
since
the
night
when
we
looked
from
the
tower
upon
the
burning
village
and
those
fierce
mahrattas
dost
thou
remember
them
alas
she
remembered
but
too
well
and
even
then
the
temptation
had
arisen
within
her
to
remain
where
kasim
ali
was
to
be
left
under
his
care
but
she
had
put
it
back
with
a
struggle
and
the
khan
s
doubt
of
her
bravery
had
rallied
her
spirit
and
with
it
her
best
feelings
had
come
to
her
aid
i
remember
khan
she
said
carelessly
but
i
would
now
prepare
the
few
things
i
shall
require
and
warn
meeran
to
accompany
go
then
i
had
told
the
patél
he
would
have
to
look
after
thee
and
strange
enough
he
thought
thou
wouldst
be
better
with
me
as
he
was
not
to
go
perhaps
he
may
be
in
the
dewan
khana
i
will
go
there
and
seek
ameena
was
left
alone
how
strange
it
was
she
thought
that
kasim
should
have
advised
what
she
herself
had
suggested
perhaps
his
dread
had
been
the
same
as
hers
and
the
very
idea
brought
painful
blushes
to
her
face
and
led
her
into
a
reverie
which
well
nigh
upset
her
resolutions
it
would
be
so
easy
to
change
her
determination
to
confess
her
fears
to
have
him
near
her
to
rely
on
him
in
all
dangers
this
would
be
happiness
but
ameena
s
virtue
was
strong
far
stronger
than
her
servant
s
who
at
first
almost
reproached
her
for
the
voluntary
loss
of
the
opportunity
which
as
she
said
destiny
had
presented
meeran
s
sophistry
was
unable
however
to
contend
with
the
honest
purpose
of
her
youthful
mistress
and
she
at
length
but
not
without
some
difficulty
yielded
to
her
whim
of
which
she
protested
she
would
be
tired
enough
when
the
english
cannon
roared
in
her
ears
and
the
balls
whizzed
through
the
camp
ameena
might
not
perhaps
have
held
out
long
against
the
combined
effects
of
her
own
inclination
and
the
terrible
stories
her
nurse
told
her
of
the
furious
english
but
there
was
little
time
for
were
to
move
on
the
morrow
preparations
for
absence
though
small
had
to
be
made
that
night
and
long
ere
noon
the
following
day
the
army
had
left
the
city
for
a
longer
absence
than
was
at
first
contemplated
but
it
is
beyond
our
province
to
follow
with
the
minuteness
essential
to
history
every
event
connected
with
the
campaign
and
we
assume
to
ourselves
upon
the
precedents
of
many
veterans
who
have
toiled
before
us
in
the
field
of
literary
pursuit
the
right
of
slightly
sketching
those
details
of
historical
occurrence
which
however
necessary
to
the
historian
can
be
omitted
or
merely
glanced
at
in
a
tale
of
the
present
character
the
sultaun
at
the
head
of
his
noble
army
proceeded
down
the
guzulhuttee
pass
the
one
in
the
angle
formed
where
the
grand
range
of
the
neelgherries
joins
the
of
mysore
and
where
a
tributary
of
the
bhowanee
pours
its
rapid
waters
into
the
plain
on
their
right
as
we
have
described
when
we
took
herbert
compton
to
his
lonely
prison
on
the
neelgherries
rose
their
vast
and
blue
chain
stretching
far
away
into
the
distance
on
the
left
the
wide
plain
and
the
breaking
away
into
it
in
a
series
of
giant
ravines
and
gloomy
depths
but
for
these
the
monarch
had
no
eyes
a
gloomy
presentiment
of
evil
appeared
to
possess
him
and
the
constant
succession
of
messengers
with
bad
tidings
of
the
news
of
fall
after
fall
of
strongholds
forts
towns
and
whole
districts
before
the
slight
force
of
the
english
inspired
him
with
a
dread
which
the
confidence
of
the
officers
around
him
could
not
restore
still
if
he
could
strike
a
decisive
blow
he
thought
all
would
yet
be
well
and
the
fame
and
terror
of
the
lion
of
mysore
once
more
spread
through
the
country
and
reaching
the
ears
of
the
english
and
their
confederates
the
nizam
and
the
mahrattas
would
divert
them
from
their
alliance
or
convert
them
into
positive
friends
the
bhowanee
was
full
but
the
army
crossed
in
and
in
the
action
which
followed
met
their
enemies
in
such
force
and
spirit
that
the
issue
of
the
conflict
compelled
the
english
commander
to
draw
off
his
force
during
the
night
and
to
retreat
in
the
hope
of
effecting
a
junction
with
the
whose
force
was
daily
expected
his
movement
was
aided
as
if
providentially
by
a
violent
rain
which
falling
in
the
sultaun
s
camp
caused
confusion
not
easily
to
be
remedied
in
the
morning
when
the
escape
of
the
english
was
known
frantic
with
rage
tippoo
ordered
an
immediate
pursuit
which
though
gallantly
performed
by
his
troops
was
ineffectual
as
well
from
the
nature
of
the
ground
and
the
protection
afforded
to
the
english
by
the
thick
prickly
as
from
the
resolute
determination
and
patience
with
which
it
was
met
at
the
small
village
of
shawoor
the
english
commander
determined
to
make
a
stand
for
his
men
were
worn
out
by
fatigue
and
excitement
and
this
as
memorable
a
display
of
obstinate
british
valour
against
overwhelming
odds
as
took
place
at
korygaum
or
seetabuldee
might
have
occurred
was
not
fated
to
be
so
distinguished
a
false
rumour
arose
of
the
advance
of
the
main
body
of
the
army
under
meadows
which
while
it
gave
new
energy
to
the
english
inspired
the
sultaun
with
dread
a
vigorous
charge
by
the
english
cavalry
determined
the
day
and
the
campaign
and
the
sultaun
dispirited
by
this
and
by
the
death
of
a
favourite
and
gallant
officer
of
rank
drew
off
his
troops
he
could
not
be
persuaded
to
resume
the
attack
but
retreated
southwards
towards
errode
on
the
river
cavery
meanwhile
the
two
english
armies
had
united
and
now
advanced
upon
the
sultaun
who
again
retreated
towards
coimbatoor
but
imagining
danger
in
that
quarter
he
turned
again
northwards
and
falling
upon
the
town
of
darapoor
in
which
were
some
english
sick
and
details
he
captured
it
and
exacted
a
fearful
revenge
for
his
defeats
and
vexation
from
hence
hearing
of
the
advance
of
the
english
in
the
direction
of
salem
and
knowing
the
passes
into
mysore
in
that
direction
to
be
easy
and
fact
only
a
series
of
hurried
thither
accompanied
by
all
his
cavalry
leaving
a
large
body
of
his
best
infantry
to
hold
the
english
in
check
and
if
necessary
to
occupy
the
high
and
rugged
passes
that
led
directly
to
the
capital
the
english
armies
were
in
possession
of
the
country
around
the
tapoor
pass
which
leads
from
the
fine
town
of
salem
and
farther
to
the
south
from
trichinopoly
into
mysore
and
it
was
evident
to
the
sultaun
that
their
territories
to
the
south
must
be
inefficiently
protected
considering
the
large
amount
of
force
which
had
been
dispatched
for
the
invasion
of
his
dominions
his
whole
mind
was
now
bent
upon
striking
a
blow
in
the
rear
of
the
advanced
force
which
should
turn
their
attention
from
their
meditated
object
to
the
defence
of
positions
and
districts
by
this
means
time
would
be
wasted
and
the
season
for
active
operation
pass
away
acting
therefore
upon
this
suggestion
he
dexterously
avoided
the
english
army
though
passing
within
sight
of
it
and
leaving
the
magnificent
range
of
the
shevaroy
mountains
to
the
left
he
took
the
direct
road
through
the
beautiful
valley
in
which
salem
is
situated
to
trichinopoly
it
was
on
the
noble
temple
of
seringham
that
his
fury
first
fell
and
by
the
desecration
of
its
sacred
images
the
plunder
and
forcible
conversion
of
its
priests
and
the
uncontrolled
licence
given
to
his
bigoted
soldiery
to
mutilate
and
destroy
a
spirit
of
revenge
was
actively
aroused
against
him
in
the
minds
of
his
hindoo
adherents
which
had
long
been
excited
by
his
acts
of
horrible
oppression
and
cruelty
to
their
unhappy
brethren
the
nairs
from
seringham
ruin
and
devastation
was
mercilessly
carried
through
coromandel
each
man
had
licence
to
plunder
as
he
listed
and
neither
youth
nor
age
was
spared
the
savage
pindharees
of
later
years
were
not
more
destructive
than
the
army
of
islam
led
on
by
its
champion
and
although
repulsed
from
the
fort
of
tiagar
by
a
mere
handful
of
british
soldiers
yet
that
of
trinomallee
was
less
fortunate
in
its
defence
and
on
its
unhappy
garrison
and
inhabitants
were
vented
in
cruelties
and
tortures
all
the
spleen
that
mortified
vanity
and
ill
success
could
prompt
tippoo
had
hoped
too
to
arouse
the
ancient
animosity
of
the
french
against
the
english
and
to
have
involved
them
in
the
war
but
his
overtures
for
assistance
were
rejected
or
evaded
by
the
governor
of
pondicherry
and
his
negotiations
for
an
embassy
to
the
court
of
louis
xvi
met
with
no
encouragement
foiled
in
these
attempts
he
renewed
his
correspondence
with
many
english
officers
in
the
same
hollow
strain
of
attempted
complaint
and
wonder
at
the
commencement
of
hostilities
that
had
before
proved
unsuccessful
but
he
had
more
able
diplomatists
and
more
wary
commanders
to
deal
with
now
than
formerly
and
having
been
unable
to
put
into
execution
his
threat
of
burning
madras
he
abandoned
the
design
and
hurried
to
meet
the
storm
which
now
threatened
to
burst
forth
from
the
nizam
and
the
mahrattas
on
the
north
and
from
the
english
on
the
east
for
lord
cornwallis
was
already
at
vellore
and
the
army
assembled
there
were
prepared
to
advance
but
the
sultaun
although
the
force
with
him
used
the
most
strenuous
exertions
failed
to
arrive
in
time
to
occupy
the
passes
and
the
english
ascended
to
the
of
mysore
without
opposition
during
the
period
of
our
tale
hitherto
the
sultaun
had
been
separated
from
the
ladies
of
his
harem
which
had
remained
in
bangalore
nor
had
he
held
much
communication
with
them
for
some
years
the
places
of
his
lawful
wives
were
supplied
from
time
to
time
as
caprice
willed
the
change
by
rudely
torn
from
their
families
by
his
captives
taken
from
among
the
nairs
and
hindoos
of
the
coast
where
his
excesses
had
been
most
dreadful
to
remain
in
favour
for
a
while
and
to
be
flung
aside
when
their
novelty
palled
upon
his
senses
but
the
mother
of
his
children
and
his
own
mother
remained
dear
to
as
any
could
be
to
one
of
so
cold
and
heartless
a
temperament
which
warmed
only
at
the
of
bigotry
and
felt
none
of
those
endearments
common
to
men
of
all
ranks
in
the
intercourse
of
their
families
his
anxiety
was
excited
upon
their
account
from
the
near
approach
of
the
english
which
he
was
unable
to
check
though
he
several
times
attempted
it
by
distant
cannonades
and
threatening
displays
of
large
bodies
of
cavalry
it
was
therefore
absolutely
necessary
that
they
should
be
removed
and
having
sent
orders
for
them
to
prepare
the
next
day
at
the
head
of
his
whole
army
he
escorted
them
from
the
fort
to
his
encampment
and
preparation
was
made
for
sending
the
harem
on
to
the
capital
but
while
these
stirring
events
proceeded
in
the
camp
and
men
s
minds
were
gradually
filled
with
alarm
at
the
progress
of
the
english
and
the
formidable
nature
of
their
attack
events
had
occurred
at
the
city
which
demand
that
we
should
notice
them
the
army
had
left
some
days
and
all
was
quiet
within
the
fort
which
but
a
short
time
before
had
resounded
with
the
continuous
beating
of
the
sultaun
s
the
exercise
of
the
soldiery
and
the
bustle
of
the
thousands
attendant
upon
the
sultaun
but
the
work
of
the
arsenals
and
foundries
continued
in
full
vigour
and
it
was
plain
to
see
that
if
the
worst
was
feared
there
was
at
least
preparation
made
to
meet
it
in
the
midst
of
this
however
with
which
he
had
no
concern
kasim
ali
formed
for
the
active
occupation
of
the
camp
led
a
life
of
inaction
from
which
he
saw
no
hope
of
release
until
he
should
once
more
resume
his
post
near
the
sultaun
and
lead
into
battle
against
the
english
his
own
gallant
fellows
who
had
often
sworn
to
follow
him
to
the
death
there
was
one
however
to
whom
his
every
movement
was
an
object
of
intense
interest
and
who
tormented
by
a
thousand
contending
passions
now
vowed
revenge
against
him
because
her
suit
had
been
rejected
now
implored
her
attendant
again
and
again
to
go
to
him
but
after
her
first
refusal
sozun
had
no
mind
to
encounter
the
stern
looks
of
the
young
patél
and
as
often
as
she
was
sent
she
would
return
with
a
lie
that
he
had
repulsed
her
it
was
dark
for
the
heavens
were
overcast
with
thick
clouds
and
the
wind
sighed
and
moaned
within
the
trees
above
the
khan
s
dwelling
every
now
and
then
a
gust
would
whistle
round
the
apartment
where
the
lady
kummoo
sat
shaking
the
latticed
windows
and
shutters
which
were
carefully
closed
she
was
alone
with
sozun
and
the
theme
had
long
been
kasim
ali
and
her
wild
ungovernable
passion
for
him
i
tell
thee
i
will
bear
this
no
longer
sozun
she
said
as
she
arose
and
opening
the
shutter
looked
forth
the
night
is
is
fit
for
the
venture
no
one
will
see
us
or
if
they
do
we
shall
not
be
holy

exclaimed
the
woman

say

to

mother
come
why
dost
thou
delay
sozun
knew
her
mistress
s
character
too
well
to
dare
a
refusal
and
she
wrapped
herself
closely
and
preceded
her
as
they
descended
the
stairs
they
met
a
servant
i
go
to
my
mother
s
for
a
no
one
follow
me
said
the
lady
and
passed
on
in
a
few
moments
they
had
quitted
the
house
and
were
in
the
open
street
lend
me
thine
arm
sozun
said
the
lady
in
a
whisper
i
tremble
much
and
the
night
is
dark
very
dark
i
did
not
think
it
would
be
so
fearful
alla
how
the
clouds
scurry
along
the
heavens
and
how
the
wind
moans
and
we
had
better
return
no
no
not
for
worlds
i
must
see
him
give
me
thine
arm
and
lead
on
hastily
traversing
a
few
streets
sozun
stopped
at
a
small
door
in
a
wall
this
is
the
place
she
whispered
and
as
she
said
it
she
felt
the
arm
within
hers
shake
as
if
with
ague
for
the
sake
of
the
prophet
let
us
turn
is
not
too

the
woman
in
broken
sentences

a
few
moments
i
shall
see
him
dare
i
not
this
knock
and
say
he
expects
thou
art
a
bold
woman
thought
sozun
and
she
knocked
loudly
the
door
was
opened
instantly
two
men
stood
within
we
are
expected
said
sozun
in
a
disguised
voice
without
waiting
to
be
questioned
and
they
proceeded
the
patél
hath
good
company
said
one
fellow
i
marvel
at
this
said
the
other
i
have
served
him
long
and
have
never
known
the
like
of
this
the
women
lost
the
rest
as
they
passed
hastily
on
kummoo
s
knees
could
hardly
support
her
but
she
followed
sozun
mechanically
her
heart
beating
violently
and
her
thoughts
striving
to
arrange
a
few
sentences
for
the
interview
vain
effort
they
rose
one
upon
another
in
wild
confusion
defying
retention
sozun
knew
the
way
she
entered
the
open
verandah
and
looked
through
the
door
into
the
next
apartment
kasim
was
there
reading
as
she
had
first
seen
him
that
is
he
she
whispered
gently
enter
kummoo
was
a
bold
and
daring
woman
but
now
her
heart
almost
failed
a
moment
only
she
entered
and
stood
before
him
who
art
thou
he
cried
and
who
has
dared
to
admit
thee
she
could
not
reply
a
few
broken
words
escaped
her
and
unable
any
longer
to
stand
or
to
control
herself
she
fell
at
his
feet
and
clasping
his
knees
sobbed
aloud
thou
art
beautiful
he
said
as
he
raised
her
up
and
gazed
upon
her
features
for
her
veil
had
fallen
who
art
thou
one
who
has
loved
thee
long
i
saw
thee
have
lived
upon
thy
look
she
said
confusedly
thou
art
not
a
tuwaif
thy
speech
is
not
like
i
am

art
a
wife

or

have
come
to
me
and

me
as
i
would
love
thee
kasim
was
sorely
tempted
her
beauty
her
large
lustrous
eyes
sparkling
with
passion
shone
upon
him
she
hung
on
him
her
hand
as
it
touched
his
was
hot
and
trembling
he
raised
her
up
and
caressed
her
and
she
threw
herself
upon
his
broad
chest
and
again
was
with
passion
then
even
then
a
thought
flashed
into
his
mind
quicker
than
light
could
she
be
the
khan
s
wife
could
he
be
the
man
old
absent
who
had
flung
her
aside
for
another
his
heart
felt
as
though
it
made
a
mighty
bound
within
his
bosom
tell
me
he
cried
by
your
for
my
mind
misgives
me
art
thou
not
the
wife
of
rhyman
khan
she
could
not
mouth
became
parched
and
her
eyes
swam
speak
he
cried
for
the
sake
of
alla
but
no
reply
came
confusion
was
evident
on
her
countenance
as
he
held
her
from
him
suddenly
her
head
drooped
and
her
form
relaxed
within
his
grasp
had
he
not
supported
her
she
would
have
fallen
for
the
sense
of
sudden
detection
had
overpowered
her
already
too
excited
feelings
and
she
had
fainted
holy
prophet
what
is
to
be
done
is
insensible
exclaimed
kasim
aloud
he
was
heard
by
sozun
who
entered
tell
me
by
your
soul
if
she
is
the
khan
s
wife
he
cried
in
agitation
not
to
be
repressed
what
matter
if
she
is
patél
she
loves
you
your
destiny
is
bright
shall
i

it

as
i

her
of
this
and
tell

friend
and
and
so
saying
he
opened
a
small
door
and
disappeared
he
is
gone
said
sozun
as
her
lady
recovered
and
looked
wildly
around
her
it
was
enough
they
did
not
wait
more
than
a
few
minutes
then
kummoo
returned
to
her
distasteful
home
filled
with
rage
and
shame
and
burning
for
revenge
chapter
xxxviii
months
had
passed
and
herbert
compton
remained
in
the
lonely
fastness
to
which
he
had
been
doomed
he
had
no
hope
of
of
escape
as
he
looked
forth
over
the
vast
plain
beneath
his
feet
he
could
see
the
interminable
forests
spread
out
before
him
through
which
he
well
knew
there
was
no
path
or
if
any
one
known
to
the
inhabitants
only
of
the
and
utterly
unattainable
by
himself
the
fort
itself
occupied
a
round
knoll
on
the
very
verge
of
the
range
and
jutted
out
a
bold
promontory
into
the
plain
forming
evidently
one
of
the
extreme
angles
of
the
chain
of
mountains
upon
which
he
was
its
sides
were
dizzy
precipices
of
five
thousand
feet
almost
perpendicular
to
the
bottom
where
they
rested
amidst
forests
the
waving
even
of
which
could
not
be
seen
from
the
top
looking
eastward
was
the
plain
of
coimbatoor
stretching
away
to
a
dim
horizon
where
at
the
distance
of
a
hundred
miles
were
seen
the
rocky
ranges
of
the
barah
mahal
hills
broken
at
first
but
gradually
appearing
to
unite
and
form
a
continuous
chain
away
to
the
left
till
increasing
in
height
in
the
immense
circle
they
joined
the
huge
mass
on
part
of
which
stood
his
prison
through
this
the
bhowanee
the
baraudee
and
several
other
streams
which
escaped
from
the
mountains
wound
their
silent
course
glistening
in
the
bright
sun
like
silver
threads
away
to
the
broader
cavery
a
faint
glimmer
of
which
might
now
and
then
be
seen
as
the
early
rays
of
the
morning
sun
shone
upon
the
plain
away
to
the
south
and
west
the
mountains
recommenced
with
the
triangular
peak
of
dindigul
which
could
sometimes
be
seen
and
continued
range
over
range
of
every
form
of
every
hue
with
which
a
brilliant
sun
acting
upon
a
dry
a
damp
or
a
hot
atmosphere
could
clothe
of
sombre
grey
of
violet
of
brilliant
purple
till
in
the
nearer
range
of
the
animallee
hills
they
assumed
more
positive
colours
and
forms
to
the
west
lay
the
broad
valley
filled
with
wood
the
only
road
to
the
sea
and
thence
herbert
s
sad
thoughts
often
wandered
in
vivid
remembrance
of
the
past
to
the
land
where
those
most
dear
to
him
on
earth
mourned
him
as
dead
he
could
not
think
that
they
could
retain
any
hope
that
he
lived
years
had
fled
since
they
had
heard
of
him
and
he
was
become
to
them
as
one
in
the
grave
one
for
any
trivial
incident
a
word
a
look
a
tone
recalls
the
dead
to
present
mingled
with
hopes
for
the
future
are
the
spontaneous
expressions
of
undying
affections
and
a
tear
is
silently
dropped
the
overflow
of
some
heart
which
clings
to
the
memory
of
the
dead
with
fondness
which
even
time
does
not
impair
to
the
north
and
west
herbert
looked
across
the
tremendous
chasm
through
which
the
military
road
now
winds
its
gradual
and
easy
ascent
up
to
coonoor
upon
the
verdant
and
sunny
hills
beyond
it
was
clothed
with
wood
here
and
there
as
though
planted
with
the
most
consummate
taste
occupying
now
the
side
now
the
gorge
of
a
tiny
valley
through
which
a
small
stream
leaped
from
rock
to
rock
till
joining
some
larger
one
it
dashed
down
the
precipitous
sides
of
the
chasm
into
the
foaming
stream
of
the
baraudee
the
roar
of
which
sometimes
reached
his
ear
at
times
he
could
distinguish
noble
herds
of
elk
browsing
upon
the
smooth
verdant
sides
of
the
declivities
and
would
watch
their
motions
for
hours
with
curious
interest
or
huge
herds
of
buffalos
tended
by
a
few
herdsmen
who
appeared
to
be
the
only
inhabitants
of
those
lovely
regions
where
the
cool
climate
of
his
beloved
country
was
joined
to
the
brightness
and
radiance
of
an
eastern
sun
but
though
he
lived
amidst
the
most
exquisite
scenery
that
it
is
possible
to
conceive
it
was
but
a
poor
compensation
for
liberty
true
under
the
rigour
of
a
burning
climate
captivity
would
have
been
more
difficult
and
painful
of
endurance
than
here
where
he
might
almost
fancy
himself
in
his
own
land
and
could
he
have
enjoyed
the
happiness
of
wandering
about
as
he
listed
over
those
beauteous
hills
through
the
valleys
and
beside
their
bounding
streams
it
would
have
sufficed
to
him
to
have
thus
dreamed
away
his
existence
poor
herbert
his
guards
might
have
set
him
free
for
escape
from
those
mountains
through
untrodden
and
pestilential
jungles
into
a
country
where
death
would
await
him
if
he
were
discovered
was
guarantee
enough
that
he
would
have
remained
but
they
were
answerable
for
him
with
their
lives
and
every
kindness
consistent
with
his
safety
was
shown
him
and
though
their
food
was
coarse
barley
bread
rice
and
the
flesh
of
elk
or
wild
hog
or
jungle
game
his
health
and
strength
seemed
to
increase
and
he
had
never
felt
greater
vigour
there
were
often
changes
in
the
little
garrison
new
comers
brought
such
spices
and
condiments
as
were
needed
and
among
them
at
last
arrived
one
who
spoke
a
few
words
of
hindostanee
that
he
should
be
able
to
speak
intelligibly
with
any
one
was
a
subject
of
inexpressible
delight
to
herbert
but
soon
a
new
hope
sprung
up
in
his
heart
which
though
slowly
admitted
yet
was
or
might
be
without
a
guide
it
was
a
useless
risk
of
life
to
attempt
it
with
one
who
knew
the
country
and
the
roads
either
to
the
coast
or
to
madras
it
was
a
matter
he
thought
of
difficult
but
not
impossible
attainment
long
he
watched
his
opportunity
to
converse
with
his
friend
for
the
man
he
thought
was
civil
and
obliging
beyond
his
fellows
but
he
was
evidently
afraid
to
speak
before
them
lest
he
should
at
once
be
suspected
and
dismissed
but
the
time
came
at
length
herbert
as
was
his
wont
lay
upon
the
green
sward
on
the
highest
point
of
the
fort
basking
in
the
warm
sun
watching
the
shadows
which
chased
each
other
over
the
beauteous
and
sailing
over
what
appeared
endless
dimming
the
sparkle
of
the
bhowanee
for
a
moment
which
again
glittered
brightly
as
the
shade
passed
away
again
they
appeared
to
creep
up
the
face
of
some
precipitous
hill
or
hang
among
its
woods
while
the
sunlight
toyed
with
the
green
slopes
and
mossy
banks
sometimes
he
speculated
idly
upon
the
scene
below
and
tried
to
make
out
the
forms
of
villages
among
the
groves
which
everywhere
appeared
amidst
the
cultivated
parts
all
was
quite
still
and
not
even
a
leaf
rustled
to
disturb
the
silence
only
the
drowsy
hum
of
a
bee
was
heard
now
and
then
as
one
flew
by
to
its
nest
under
a
precipice
laden
with
sweets
suddenly
as
he
listened
he
thought
he
heard
the
roll
of
musketry
it
was
very
faint
but
it
came
to
a
soldier
s
ear
with
distinctness
enough
to
be
heard
he
started
to
his
feet
and
listened
with
painful
eagerness
while
his
eye
travelled
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
his
whole
action
was
so
sudden
and
his
attitude
so
wrapt
that
his
attendant
who
had
been
basking
beside
him
was
thrown
completely
off
his
guard
what
dost
thou
hear
sahib
he
said
eagerly
in
hindostanee
what
dost
thou
see
hush
cried
herbert
listen
there
was
a
gun
and
then
musketry
gun
again
what
can
that
mean
alla
knows
said
the
man
but
it
is
even
so
look
was
that
smoke
by
alla
it
is
at
coimbatoor
canst
see
the
minarets
of
the
mosque
gleaming
thou
speakest
well
in
thy
new
tongue
said
herbert
why
hast
thou
not
spoken
to
me
before
i
dared
not
even
now
do
not
for
the
sake
of
your
faith
and
mine
venture
by
word
or
sign
to
speak
to
me
before
the
others
or
it
may
cost
me
my
i
will
be
discreet
and
risk
nothing
where
are
they
some
are
hunting
some
are
at
the
house
the
sound
came
again
dost
thou
not
see
the
smoke
inquired
he
no
i
see
none
said
herbert
straining
his
eyes
the
sultaun
must
be
there
and
they
are
firing
said
the
man
it
is
wonderful
that
sound
should
come
thus
for
some
time
they
continued
to
hear
it
for
ahmed
herbert
s
acquaintance
called
his
associates
and
they
all
listened
and
speculated
but
could
come
to
no
conclusion
and
then
the
wind
arose
and
they
heard
no
more
but
they
were
evidently
perplexed
and
continued
to
speak
of
it
during
the
evening
at
last
one
went
out
and
returned
with
an
expression
of
wonder
upon
his
countenance
he
spoke
to
his
companions
and
some
got
up
and
followed
him
soon
these
sent
for
the
rest
and
they
took
herbert
with
them
it
was
quite
dark
near
them
a
few
objects
were
distinguishable
when
the
eye
became
accustomed
to
the
darkness
but
overhead
the
sky
was
quite
overcast
and
black
and
though
there
was
no
wind
yet
the
cold
air
of
night
was
chill
and
piercing
at
that
height
they
advanced
to
the
place
where
they
had
been
in
the
morning
it
was
within
a
stone
s
throw
of
the
brink
of
the
precipice
which
descended
full
four
thousand
feet
before
it
met
even
any
of
the
projecting
buttresses
which
appeared
to
support
the
mighty
fabric
with
difficulty
they
could
see
to
the
edge
beyond
that
all
was
vast
void
into
the
depths
of
which
the
eye
strove
to
penetrate
as
the
mind
into
illimitable
space
and
eternity
and
felt
as
if
it
were
thrust
back
and
checked
for
its
presumption
by
the
awful
profundity
it
seemed
to
herbert
as
though
the
ground
they
trod
had
no
support
and
was
sinking
into
the
gloomy
abyss
there
seemed
to
be
no
horizon
no
sky
instinctively
the
group
closed
together
and
seemingly
spoke
hardly
above
their
breath
we
saw
it
awhile
ago
said
one
to
another
of
those
who
had
just
arrived
with
herbert
what
did
ye
see
lights
in
that
black
darkness
look
carefully
ye
may
see
them
there
there
cried
several
look
what
can
they
be
herbert
saw
where
they
pointed
in
the
direction
where
he
had
heard
the
firing
in
the
morning
and
in
the
middle
of
the
void
before
him
for
an
instant
or
two
were
several
bright
flashes
he
rubbed
his
eyes
which
ached
from
gazing
and
from
the
effect
even
of
those
transient
flashes
again
he
looked
and
listened
there
was
no
sound
except
the
sigh
of
the
night
breeze
in
a
tree
near
him
but
again
there
were
flashes
in
the
same
place
and
now
while
they
gazed
a
light
arose
soared
in
a
little
circle
into
the
air
and
descended
another
and
another
herbert
knew
what
they
were
and
his
heart
bounded
within
him
with
a
quickness
of
pulsation
it
had
not
known
for
years
they
should
be
his
countrymen
his
guards
turned
to
one
another
and
spoke
rapidly
among
themselves
with
eager
gestures
at
last
ahmed
addressed
him
they
bid
me
ask
you
he
said
what
this
is
you
europeans
know
all
things
hath
the
sky
such
lights
no
it
is
a
siege
said
herbert
and
the
lights
are
shells
and
cannon
is
the
sultaun
at
war
i
know
not
but
will
and
herbert
heard
the
word
feringhee
in
the
answer
he
was
sure
that
his
countrymen
were
near
and
his
heart
yearned
to
them
there
have
been
rumours
of
war
said
ahmed
and
we
heard
that
the
english
were
in
the
barah
mahal
but
they
can
not
have
got
so
far
for
the
sultaun
had
marched
in
person
with
the
whole
of
the
herbert
thought
otherwise
he
could
imagine
nothing
but
victory
for
the
arms
he
had
once
borne
and
for
the
cause
in
which
he
would
gladly
have
died
after
watching
long
they
withdrew
from
the
spot
chilled
and
wearied
and
all
lay
down
to
rest
but
herbert
could
not
sleep
his
thoughts
were
too
engrossing
for
sleep
escape
was
now
possible
and
long
he
deliberated
whether
it
was
not
practicable
alone
on
the
south
east
and
north
sides
of
the
droog
were
huge
precipices
as
we
have
already
mentioned
the
only
access
to
it
was
from
the
west
by
which
he
had
come
even
were
he
to
escape
from
the
fort
could
he
venture
to
descend
any
of
the
passes
to
the
plain
narrow
paths
which
at
the
bottom
branched
out
into
endless
ramification
led
he
knew
not
whither
through
dense
forests
that
extended
for
miles
and
miles
the
abode
of
pestilence
and
of
wild
beasts
innumerable
the
thought
was
appalling
and
the
more
he
weighed
the
risk
in
his
mind
the
less
chance
did
there
appear
of
success
could
it
be
that
ahmed
would
assist
him
the
obstacle
of
language
had
been
broken
through
and
no
sooner
did
his
busy
thoughts
suggest
the
idea
than
his
mind
clung
to
it
ahmed
was
poor
he
could
not
refuse
money
and
he
would
offer
him
anything
he
chose
to
for
liberty
he
waited
till
his
watch
came
and
when
all
were
asleep
and
breathing
heavily
he
called
him
by
name
in
a
loud
whisper
ahmed
ahmed
he
was
dozing
even
on
his
watch
and
did
not
hear
at
first
herbert
was
in
agony
lest
the
others
should
awake
ahmed
answered
at
last
what
dost
thou
require
he
said
come
here
i
would
speak
to
thee
he
arose
and
crossed
the
hut
it
was
a
good
sign
he
seated
himself
close
to
herbert
perhaps
he
had
too
been
thinking
of
the
escape
ahmed
said
the
young
man
thou
hast
been
kind
to
me
i
love
thee
for
thou
hast
spoken
to
me
thou
art
my
friend
wilt
thou
then
aid
me
they
say
you
english
are
deceitful
and
faithless
replied
the
man
they
wrong
thy
head
they
wrong
us
our
enemies
alone
say
so
we
are
faithful
even
to
death
wilt
thou
trust
one
and
that
one
me
the
man
moved
but
spoke
not
wilt
thou
aid
me
continued
herbert
for
he
perceived
he
was
listened
to
behold
i
trust
thee
in
thus
speaking
to
thee
and
am
utterly
in
thy
power
if
it
is
thy
will
thou
canst
denounce
me
to
thine
associates
even
now
see
how
i
trust
wilt
not
betray
me
for
years
i
have
languished
in
captivity
i
have
a
father
mother
brethren
other
too
even
dearer
than
they
they
think
me
dead
and
the
old
have
long
mourned
with
bitter
grief
even
the
grief
of
parents
for
a
firstborn
and
beloved
hast
thou
no
heart
for
this
to
plead
for
me
within
thee
again
the
man
writhed
but
spoke
not
hast
thou
no
tenderness
that
i
may
appeal
to
it
hast
thou
no
if
thou
wert
dead
would
mourn
for
thee
but
who
living
rejoice
for
thee
i
have
all
was
the
reply
i
have
not
the
last
said
herbert
sadly
that
was
a
pang
spared
me
yet
there
is
one
who
in
blighted
hope
and
crushed
and
withered
affection
mourns
me
as
long
since
numbered
with
the
dead
thou
canst
restore
peace
where
there
is
sorrow
hope
where
there
is
i
can
not
aid
thee
thou
canst
thou
canst
my
countrymen
are
yonder
i
feel
that
they
are
must
be
victorious
else
they
had
not
penetrated
so
far
guide
me
to
them
and
thou
wilt
earn
my
gratitude
and
with
it
a
competence
for
life
thou
knowest
the
passes
to
me
the
attempt
unaided
would
be
it
would
indeed
alone
i
would
not
attempt
them
for
a
kingdom
even
with
my
knowledge
but
i
feel
for
thee
feringhee
thy
looks
are
gentle
thy
speech
is
soft
thou
art
not
as
i
have
been
told
the
english
are
i
will
believe
thou
art
to
be
oh
believe
it
believe
it
ahmed
my
life
will
be
in
thy
hands
thou
canst
guide
me
to
liberty
or
to
death
i
am
ready
to
trust
thee
can
i
say
more
enough
sahib
i
rely
upon
thee
i
swear
by
alla
and
the
prophet
to
guide
thee
safely
to
it
be
true
that
thy
countrymen
are
there
further
than
that
if
they
are
not
there
i
should
but
lead
thee
into
death
and
fall
a
sacrifice
myself
but
listen
i
risk
much
my
parents
love
me
i
have
too
a
wife
and
a
are
dependent
upon
me
if
we
are
detected
the
vengeance
of
the
sultaun
will
fall
on
them
and
that
is
fearful
thou
seest
i
have
an
equal
risk
with
thyself
wilt
thou
trust
thou
hast
brave
fellow
and
i
estimate
thy
generosity
as
that
of
a
brother
but
we
have
spoken
of
no
nor
will
i
said
the
man
you
are
noble
your
appearance
even
in
those
rags
is
noble
i
trust
to
gallant
fellow
thy
confidence
shall
be
well
repaid
if
i
live
thou
shalt
know
no
poverty
but
wealth
to
the
end
of
thy
life
and
honourable
service
if
thou
choosest
it
but
shall
we
make
the
attempt
the
relief
is
expected
or
the
day
after
the
men
will
bring
us
news
and
upon
that
we
will
arrange
by
evening
the
next
day
the
expected
relief
came
the
news
was
true
the
english
besieged
coimbatoor
but
with
indifferent
success
it
was
said
that
the
sultaun
was
out
and
victorious
even
to
the
gates
of
madras
the
men
were
exulting
over
the
discomfiture
of
the
english
darest
thou
now
attempt
it
asked
ahmed
that
evening
the
news
of
thy
people
is
i
will
should
i
perish
in
the
then
i
will
lead
thee
out
on
pretence
of
taking
thee
with
me
to
hunt
i
have
already
said
thou
shouldst
have
recreation
and
they
have
agreed
to
allow
it
enough
now
but
gird
up
thy
loins
tightly
and
be
ready
for
we
shall
have
far
to
go
and
to
tarry
by
the
way
is
the
morrow
dawned
cloudy
and
damp
day
the
mighty
mists
lay
still
in
the
hollows
and
ravines
obscuring
everything
ahmed
was
in
despair
through
those
clouds
he
said
we
can
never
penetrate
but
should
be
lost
among
the
long
before
noon
however
the
wind
arose
and
stirring
the
vast
volumes
of
cloud
from
their
repose
caused
them
to
boil
up
from
the
abysses
around
them
and
gradually
to
melt
into
air
come
said
ahmed
to
herbert
whose
heart
bounded
and
his
eye
sparkled
as
he
heard
the
summons
come
the
men
are
about
to
return
we
will
see
them
a
little
way
and
then
turn
on
ourselves
come
they
are
he
obeyed
eagerly
and
soon
the
fort
was
left
behind
and
the
narrow
neck
which
connects
the
place
to
the
main
body
of
the
awful
precipice
on
each
passed
in
safety
soon
they
plunged
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
woods
by
a
narrow
path
descending
till
they
reached
one
branch
of
the
baraudee
which
foaming
and
dashing
amidst
rocks
brawled
on
its
way
to
the
plain
here
they
divided
the
party
ascending
the
green
slope
before
them
and
herbert
and
his
companion
turning
up
the
stream
apparently
in
search
of
game
lie
down
lie
down
cried
ahmed
shookur
alla
they
are
gone
and
there
is
yet
day
enough
for
us
ere
evening
we
must
be
on
the
edge
of
the
range
and
the
morrow
will
see
us
far
below
it
canst
thou
bear
fatigue
any
look
at
am
stronger
than
thou
the
man
regarded
him
earnestly
and
read
full
well
in
the
clear
eye
and
open
brow
ruddy
cheek
and
firmly
knit
frame
a
defiance
of
danger
i
fear
not
for
thee
he
said
alla
akbar
the
victory
will
be
a
while
they
lay
concealed
among
the
long
fern
and
then
rising
up
ahmed
looked
carefully
around
him
the
party
was
long
out
of
sight
and
they
proceeded
with
light
hearts
and
buoyant
steps
ahmed
had
not
overrated
his
knowledge
of
the
mountains
he
led
herbert
along
the
edge
of
the
stream
for
a
while
and
as
they
went
along
herbert
pulled
wild
flowers
flowers
of
his
own
england
woodbine
and
wild
rose
archis
and
wild
hyacinth
and
the
graceful
cyclamen
and
fern
and
violets
and
the
more
familiar
buttercup
and
wild
anemone
they
know
not
that
such
a
paradise
exists
in
this
land
he
said
and
these
shall
be
my
tokens
even
as
the
spies
brought
grapes
and
figs
to
the
children
of
israel
in
the
hardly
now
he
heeded
the
lovely
scenery
that
was
around
him
everywhere
among
which
the
round
top
of
his
old
prison
occupied
a
conspicuous
place
clothed
with
wood
to
its
very
summit
and
its
precipitous
sides
rising
out
of
the
huge
chasm
that
now
lay
between
him
and
it
at
the
bottom
of
which
roared
the
baraudee
leaping
from
ledge
to
ledge
in
foam
in
an
endless
succession
of
cataracts
now
and
then
they
would
catch
glimpses
of
the
blue
plain
beyond
which
melted
into
the
horizon
and
the
deep
and
gloomy
ravine
on
their
right
hand
presented
an
endless
variety
of
views
of
such
exquisite
beauty
that
herbert
would
often
stop
breathless
to
contemplate
in
admiration
of
their
loveliness
for
which
his
companion
appeared
to
have
no
eyes
they
had
now
travelled
for
some
hours
and
the
road
had
been
a
toilsome
one
owing
to
the
constantly
recurring
deep
valleys
which
broke
into
the
ravine
we
have
mentioned
it
was
now
evening
the
sun
was
sinking
into
the
west
amidst
clouds
of
glory
and
the
huge
shadows
of
the
mountains
were
fast
creeping
over
the
plain
the
precipices
of
shone
like
gold
under
the
red
light
which
resting
upon
the
vast
forests
and
hanging
woods
caused
them
to
glow
with
a
thousand
rich
tints
and
wherever
a
small
oozing
of
water
spread
itself
down
a
naked
rock
it
glittered
so
that
the
eye
could
hardly
behold
it
art
thou
fatigued
sahib
asked
ahmed
thou
hast
borne
this
well
and
like
a
man
by
alla
i
had
thought
thy
race
were
as
soft
as
no
i
can
endure
yet
a
good
hour
said
herbert
gaily
tis
well
then
we
will
push
on
why
hast
thou
burthened
thyself
with
those
flowers
fling
them
wilt
be
the
not
so
my
friend
these
are
the
flowers
of
my
own
land
and
i
take
them
to
my
comrades
thou
dost
not
canst
not
feel
how
dearly
such
things
are
prized
in
a
distant
with
them
as
they
do
remembrances
of
past
time
and
of
those
who
shared
it
on
with
thee
behold
i
hardly
a
mile
further
on
the
very
summit
of
the
mountain
ere
it
declined
into
the
plain
they
reached
a
rock
beside
which
was
a
tiny
footpath
hardly
perceptible
this
is
our
resting
place
for
the
night
said
ahmed
many
a
time
have
i
slept
here
with
a
load
of
tobacco
on
my
shoulders
for
the
mountaineers
who
are
a
curious
ay
indeed
yes
i
will
tell
thee
all
about
them
but
lay
thyself
down
beneath
this
rock
and
it
will
shelter
thee
from
the
cold
wind
i
will
get
some
sticks
and
we
will
have
a
fire
i
should
like
a
smoke
too
after
this
and
so
saying
he
disencumbered
himself
of
his
arms
and
turned
off
to
a
short
distance
herbert
lay
for
a
while
looking
out
on
the
glorious
prospect
in
a
sense
of
the
most
delicious
security
and
enjoyment
what
exquisite
visions
were
floating
before
his
eyes
as
shutting
them
he
allowed
the
ideas
to
crowd
into
his
soul
of
home
of
love
of
amy
of
his
parents
suddenly
however
there
was
a
loud
roar
the
crash
of
which
seemed
to
paralyse
his
heart
it
was
followed
by
a
scream
so
shrill
and
piercing
that
he
never
forgot
it
to
his
dying
day
hastily
snatching
up
the
sword
which
lay
before
him
he
drew
it

hurried

there
are
few
on
earth
who
in
the
chequered
track
of
their
earthly
cheered
by
the
glowing
beams
of
a
sunny
mind
often
obscured
by
despondency
often
hurried
on
by
impatience
and
querulousness
and
yearning
with
vain
desire
to
penetrate
the
veil
of
the
hidden
do
not
recall
to
memory
some
crisis
when
the
happiness
they
sought
has
been
apparently
within
their
the
hand
stretched
forth
to
grasp
the
cup
has
been
dashed
down
by
a
rude
but
irresistible
force
which
taught
them
in
that
moment
how
vain
was
their
power
how
little
their
strivings
to
attain
their
end
when
compared
with
the
providence
which
held
it
in
disposal
providence
fate
destiny
it
what
we
is
an
overruling
power
visible
in
the
meanest
events
of
our
lives
which
if
we
follow
it
up
to
its
source
in
our
own
hearts
can
not
fail
to
impress
us
with
a
feeling
of
littleness
often
mortifying
and
hard
for
proud
minds
to
bear
feeling
that
there
is
a
power
guiding
and
often
suddenly
and
rudely
checking
us
in
the
midst
of
a
career
which
we
have
marked
out
for
for
which
may
not
be
accordant
with
the
purposes
of
our
being

is
the
possessor
of
that
temperament
who
even
in
the
midst
of
a
murmur
at
misfortune
blighted
hope
prolonged
sickness
or
blasted
ambition
rises
to
his
say
it
is
for
my
is
the
hand
of
bow
to
its
correction
in
but
it
was
difficult
for
herbert
compton
to
be
reasonable
under
so
bitter
a
disappointment
wild
with
excitement
he
roamed
hither
and
thither
without
fear
for
in
that
moment
he
had
no
thought
of
danger
the
poor
fellow
who
had
perilled
his
all
for
safety
of
his
parents
of
his
had
so
trusted
him
as
to
commit
without
hesitation
his
future
destiny
into
his
last
act
was
one
of
careful
kindness
and
gone
for
ever
the
happiness
the
exquisite
enjoyment
of
a
meeting
with
his
countrymen
which
he
had
tasted
in
anticipation
had
been
dashed
from
his
hand
in
one
moment
how
often
while
there
was
light
did
he
awake
the
echoes
of
the
mountains
with
the
name
of
ahmed
he
roamed
everywhere
tried
to
track
the
animal
who
had
carried
off
his
poor
friend
by
the
trail
of
his
body
through
the
fern
and
succeeded
for
a
short
distance
but
lost
it
again
irretrievably
he
returned
to
the
spot
where
they
had
first
stopped
the
whole
was
a
hideous
dream
which
in
vain
he
tried
to
shut
out
from
his
thoughts
vain
indeed
was
the
effort
the
tiger
s
roar
and
ahmed
s
piercing
scream
rang
in
his
ears
and
often
he
would
start
as
he
thought
they
were
repeated
during
the
fearful
hours
which
ensued
as
the
night
closed
the
wind
arose
and
with
it
clouds
came
up
out
of
the
west
filled
with
cold
driving
rain
the
ledge
he
was
under
afforded
but
slight
protection
and
yet
it
sheltered
him
enough
to
allow
of
a
smouldering
fire
which
after
many
efforts
he
kindled
the
storm
increased
dark
masses
of
clouds
hurried
past
apparently
close
to
his
head
and
the
blast
groaned
and
whistled
through
the
ravines
and
around
the
peaks
and
precipices
of
the
mountains
he
could
see
nothing
for
the
same
black
darkness
which
had
surrounded
the
night
before
now
enveloped
him
there
was
only
the
little
light
of
the
fire
as
the
leaves
and
dead
fern
blazed
up
at
times
under
the
effect
of
an
eddy
of
wind
and
then
utter
darkness
fell
again
hour
after
hour
passed
in
deliberation
as
to
his
future
conduct
dare
he
attempt
the
passage
of
those
fearful
jungles
alone
encounter
wild
beasts
thread
trackless
forests
where
there
was
no
path
and
which
were
filled
with
rank
grass
and
reeds
thorny
rattans
matted
creepers
dank
and
noisome
swamps
the
abode
of
deadly
pestilence
for
the
time
he
was
free
but
even
if
he
gained
the
plain
did
not
a
more
terrible
captivity
await
him
perhaps
in
a
hot
and
parching
dungeon
where
the
fresh
air
and
the
beauteous
face
of
nature
would
never
be
felt
or
seen
but
he
was
not
to
be
daunted
he
thought
he
knew
the
direction
countrymen
were
before
him
and
the
path
was
distinct
enough
he
supposed
for
him
to
track
it
this
idea
consoled
him
and
he
fell
asleep
for
a
while
till
the
morning
broke
he
awakened
only
to
endure
fresh
disappointment
he
was
surrounded
by
dense
mists
which
though
sometimes
they
would
partially
clear
away
filled
the
space
before
him
so
completely
that
he
could
see
nought
but
a
thick
boiling
mass
fearfully
agitated
by
the
wind
now
rising
up
as
though
to
overwhelm
him
now
sinking
and
displaying
for
an
instant
the
bluff
top
of
or
a
part
of
its
precipitous
sides
or
at
an
immeasurable
and
giddy
depth
the
bottom
of
the
chasm
with
the
baraudee
roaring
and
flashing
among
the
darkness
he
was
in
despair
but
he
was
calmer
even
the
utter
hopelessness
of
attempting
to
proceed
down
a
precipitous
into
a
trackless
forest
enveloped
in
cloud
caused
a
revulsion
of
feeling
and
a
sense
that
there
was
an
unseen
but
protection
afforded
the
very
obstacles
in
his
path
probably
preserved
him
from
following
it
on
to
destruction
there
was
no
other
course
left
but
to
to
captivity
for
suspicion
might
be
aroused
against
him
a
life
of
wearisome
endurance
but
still
with
beautiful
nature
for
a
companion
in
whose
and
glorious
features
there
was
ever
something
new
to
contemplate
and
to
adore
ahmed
s
sword
shield
and
matchlock
lay
on
the
ground
he
took
them
with
him
vowing
they
should
never
part
from
him
the
latter
was
useless
for
defence
for
the
charge
was
wet
and
the
and
had
been
around
the
waist
of
the
dead
the
flowers
he
had
gathered
too
lay
beside
them
they
were
faded
types
of
his
withered
hope
that
day
he
was
to
have
rejoiced
over
them
with
his
countrymen
alas
when
would
such
an
event
now
come
the
future
was
a
dreary
blank
before
him
where
so
lately
all
had
been
bright
and
sunny
and
with
a
sad
heart
but
with
feelings
subdued
from
the
excitement
of
the
past
evening
he
began
to
retrace
his
steps
this
was
no
easy
task
for
the
rain
which
had
cleared
away
for
an
hour
or
so
after
daylight
now
began
again
to
pour
in
torrents
and
he
was
chilled
to
the
heart
but
the
very
difficulties
before
him
caused
him
to
summon
all
his
energies
to
meet
them
and
he
strove
manfully
and
conquered
his
worst
suffering
was
faintness
for
want
of
food
for
the
cakes
they
had
brought
with
them
ahmed
had
tied
in
a
handkerchief
about
his
back
which
he
had
not
removed
as
the
night
set
in
gloomily
and
dark
herbert
compton
well
nigh
exhausted
by
hunger
fatigue
and
cold
toiled
up
the
steep
and
rugged
path
which
led
to
the
fort
from
the
stream
below
and
though
often
missing
the
way
which
in
the
darkness
caused
by
the
thick
wood
over
his
head
was
almost
undiscernible
he
at
last
crossed
the
narrow
neck
already
mentioned
and
soon
after
saw
the
welcome
lights
of
the
garrison
huts
twinkling
among
the
trees
above
him
this
lent
him
fresh
energy
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
arrived
before
them
hungry
wet
and
cold
he
did
not
consider
for
a
moment
the
probable
issue
of
his
reception
and
entered
that
habitation
where
he
had
used
to
reside
there
was
a
group
sitting
smoking
around
a
blazing
fire
who
started
to
their
feet
suddenly
as
he
thus
unceremoniously
presented
himself
and
after
gazing
earnestly
at
him
for
a
moment
all
simultaneously
dashed
towards
him
and
seized
him
herbert
did
not
struggle
in
their
hands
nor
could
he
answer
the
rapid
and
almost
unintelligible
inquiries
for
their
missing
companion
which
were
poured
forth
in
a
torrent
in
a
few
moments
too
they
saw
ahmed
s
sword
and
shield
and
their
dark
frowns
and
menacing
looks
were
bent
upon
him
and
the
hand
of
more
than
one
stole
to
the
weapon
by
his
side
as
if
to
inflict
summary
revenge
on
him
who
they
might
well
suppose
had
destroyed
their
absent
friend
gradually
however
herbert
s
calm
and
sorrowful
manner
impressed
them
with
a
sense
of
his
innocence
and
as
they
became
more
reasonable
in
their
behaviour
he
described
as
well
as
he
was
able
and
mostly
by
signs
the
event
which
had
happened
and
pointed
in
the
direction
of
the
place
sorrow
was
on
all
their
faces
and
many
wept
for
ahmed
had
been
a
favourite
among
them
and
while
one
of
them
set
refreshment
before
the
weary
herbert
the
rest
conversed
in
groups
upon
the
subject
although
he
could
understand
but
little
of
what
passed
he
could
see
that
it
was
their
intention
to
put
his
innocence
to
the
proof
by
conducting
them
to
the
spot
where
the
event
had
happened
he
was
right
they
allowed
him
to
rest
that
night
without
molestation
but
by
daylight
he
was
awakened
and
he
found
the
majority
of
the
little
garrison
twelve
or
fourteen
men
equipped
for
the
expedition
each
with
his
match
lighted
after
a
hasty
meal
they
proceeded
the
morning
was
clear
and
fine
and
the
air
fresh
and
bracing
the
errand
upon
which
he
was
going
was
a
sad
one
to
herbert
and
yet
there
was
a
melancholy
satisfaction
in
finding
perhaps
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
ahmed
and
at
any
rate
the
cheering
excitement
of
vigorous
exercise
in
a
rapid
walk
over
the
beautiful
hills
there
were
no
traces
of
the
storm
of
the
day
before
except
an
increased
freshness
and
odour
of
the
wild
flowers
here
and
there
vast
masses
of
white
vapour
were
hanging
softly
upon
the
precipices
of
the
droog
or
resting
in
the
abysses
at
its
foot
herbert
proceeded
at
a
rapid
pace
before
the
rest
there
was
evidently
much
surprise
excited
among
them
at
the
direction
which
he
took
and
many
significant
glances
were
exchanged
from
time
to
time
nor
were
these
the
less
decided
when
they
arrived
at
the
rock
and
little
footpath
several
appeared
at
once
to
conclude
that
escape
had
been
ahmed
s
object
and
they
pointed
significantly
to
the
plain
and
to
the
path
which
led
to
it
here
was
the
place
however
and
having
explained
as
well
as
he
could
their
arrival
and
ahmed
s
intention
of
lighting
a
fire
herbert
led
them
to
the
long
fern
whither
he
had
gone
for
materials
for
the
purpose
they
were
all
armed
and
every
man
blew
his
match
and
looked
carefully
as
he
proceeded
it
was
evident
now
that
they
believed
him
the
chief
among
them
was
in
advance
he
was
a
capital
shot
and
herbert
had
often
seen
him
hit
the
smallest
marks
when
they
practised
for
their
amusement
at
the
fort
the
trail
of
the
body
was
quickly
found
and
these
expert
hunters
at
once
traced
it
where
herbert
could
see
no
mark
much
further
than
he
had
any
idea
the
tiger
would
have
gone
here
and
there
too
a
bit
of
rag
fluttered
upon
a
thorny
bush
which
was
a
plain
indication
that
they
were
right
at
last
as
they
proceeded
more
and
more
carefully
a
crow
suddenly
arose
from
among
some
tall
fern
with
a
hoarse
and
startling
croak
and
hovering
over
the
spot
aroused
many
others
some
vultures
and
kites
too
flew
up
and
wheeled
around
screaming
discordantly
and
a
jackal
skulked
off
into
a
near
thicket
evidently
disturbed
from
his
repast
he
is
there
said
the
leader
of
the
party
in
a
low
tone
and
a
hasty
colloquy
took
place
among
them
for
a
moment
all
seemed
brave
fellows
and
again
they
advanced
without
hesitation
they
had
scarcely
gone
many
steps
when
some
torn
apparel
met
their
eye
and
a
few
steps
further
lying
amongst
the
fern
were
the
mangled
remains
of
their
poor
comrade
his
features
were
all
gone
but
the
and
were
around
his
waist
and
to
his
back
was
fastened
the
handkerchief
which
still
contained
the
cakes
he
had
tied
up
in
it
with
a
passionate
burst
of
grief
most
of
them
darted
to
the
spot
and
looked
on
the
sad
sad
to
herbert
who
overcome
by
bitter
thoughts
gave
full
vent
to
emotions
he
did
not
seek
to
repress
but
they
were
not
long
inactive
a
search
for
the
tiger
seemed
determined
on
and
they
proceeded
in
a
body
round
and
round
the
place
they
had
not
gone
far
however
when
they
heard
a
growl
a
low
harsh
growl
which
made
the
blood
run
cold
in
herbert
s
veins
they
stood
for
a
moment
and
it
was
repeated
it
appeared
close
to
them
and
one
fired
in
the
direction
it
was
enough
with
a
roar
which
rent
the
air
the
noble
brute
bounded
forth
from
his
lair
of
fern
his
sides
shining
in
the
bright
sun
for
an
instant
he
regarded
them
with
glaring
eyes
turned
and
fled
there
was
a
precipice
a
little
beyond
he
stopped
at
the
edge
and
looked
over
it
was
evidently
too
high
to
leap
and
as
he
hesitated
on
the
brink
one
man
fired
shot
was
well
aimed
the
tiger
turned
again
roared
most
fearfully
but
immediately
after
staggered
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
his
hind
quarters
appeared
paralysed
and
fell
over
but
he
still
held
on
by
his
claws
though
they
slipped
every
moment
the
leader
saw
his
opportunity
raised
his
gun
and
fired
herbert
heard
the
ball
crash
into
the
the
grim
head
quiver
for
a
moment
the
paws
relax
their
hold
and
the
whole
frame
slip
all
darted
forward
and
looked
over
it
was
a
fearfully
giddy
place
the
blue
depth
was
filled
with
boiling
tiger
s
body
was
descending
rapidly
turning
over
and
over
at
last
it
hit
a
projection
and
bounded
away
till
the
mist
appeared
to
rise
and
hide
it
from
their
view
enough
cried
the
leader
let
us
they
returned
to
the
dead
it
was
impossible
to
remove
the
remains
they
were
so
mutilated
but
they
hastily
dug
a
shallow
place
with
their
broad
and
laid
them
in
it
covering
the
spot
with
thorns
and
large
heavy
stones
then
all
lay
down
on
the
brow
of
the
mountain
and
rested
for
a
while
and
herbert
was
glad
when
they
set
out
on
their
return
homewards
for
the
spot
was
filled
with
too
many
bitter
regrets
for
the
dead
and
for
the
untoward
accident
that
once
more
had
thrown
him
back
into
captivity
which
now
appeared
endless
for
as
they
passed
the
rock
and
pathway
they
pointed
to
it
and
to
the
plain
and
shook
their
laughing
others
with
frowns
and
threatening
gestures
which
told
him
plainly
that
to
attempt
to
escape
would
be
death
henceforth
his
life
became
a
blank
it
was
not
long
after
philip
dalton
and
his
wife
reached
india
with
their
companion
young
hayward
that
the
aggressions
of
tippoo
sultaun
upon
the
rajah
of
travancore
and
his
known
detention
of
prisoners
since
the
peace
of
together
with
many
insults
upon
the
frontiers
for
which
no
satisfaction
was
ever
obtained
determined
lord
cornwallis
to
declare
war
against
him
and
once
this
had
been
done
in
a
formal
manner
every
nerve
was
strained
by
the
government
of
india
to
meet
the
exigency
in
a
decisive
and
efficient
manner
it
is
foreign
to
our
tale
to
describe
every
event
of
the
war
which
has
already
been
so
much
more
efficiently
done
in
the
histories
of
the
period
besides
we
have
a
pleasant
licence
in
such
matters
without
which
it
would
be
impossible
for
us
to
conduct
our
readers
to
any
satisfactory
conclusion
of
our
history
we
shall
therefore
only
state
that
availing
himself
of
the
undefended
state
of
the
passes
and
while
the
sultaun
was
occupied
with
his
fruitless
negotiations
with
the
french
lord
cornwallis
ascended
into
mysore
and
ere
he
could
be
opposed
by
any
force
had
advanced
considerably
towards
the
strong
fort
of
bangalore
there
were
partial
engagements
for
some
days
between
the
mysore
cavalry
led
often
by
the
sultaun
in
person
and
the
english
but
they
were
attended
by
no
decisive
result
and
did
not
operate
in
any
way
to
check
the
invasion
bangalore
fell
the
siege
and
the
heroic
defence
of
its
brave
governor
are
themes
which
are
still
sung
in
the
country
and
will
never
pass
from
the
memory
of
its
inhabitants
while
there
remains
one
of
its
itinerant
bards
who
with
two
brass
wires
stretched
between
two
gourds
at
each
end
of
a
stick
perambulate
the
towns
and
villages
for
a
scanty
and
subsistence
the
sultaun
retreated
upon
his
capital
and
to
capture
that
was
the
object
of
the
campaign
but
ere
the
army
could
advance
it
was
thought
necessary
to
reduce
some
small
forts
in
the
neighbourhood
and
to
throw
into
them
garrisons
of
such
hindoo
inhabitants
of
the
country
who
had
welcomed
the
english
invasion
and
already
assisted
it
against
the
sultaun
as
would
keep
them
from
the
occupation
of
the
sultaun
s
troops
from
his
interest
with
the
higher
ranks
of
the
army
and
his
talent
and
efficiency
philip
dalton
had
in
the
opening
of
the
campaign
been
appointed
to
the
general
staff
of
the
army
while
charles
hayward
remained
with
his
regiment
they
continued
however
together
both
inhabiting
the
same
tent
and
as
their
history
was
known
to
many
they
were
objects
of
peculiar
interest
indeed
poor
herbert
s
fate
was
one
in
which
the
sympathies
of
all
were
powerfully
excited
and
many
were
the
sincere
aspirations
that
the
issue
of
the
war
might
restore
him
and
others
both
english
and
native
to
sorrowing
and
despairing
relatives
the
reduction
of
the
small
forts
we
have
alluded
to
was
a
service
of
no
great
difficulty
and
when
the
army
lay
encamped
near
of
arrangements
were
being
made
for
its
occupation
it
was
common
for
the
officers
to
examine
such
places
or
objects
of
interest
as
the
neighbourhood
of
their
camp
afforded
among
these
was
the
famous
rock
whence
prisoners
used
to
be
flung
and
of
which
mention
has
already
been
made
as
connected
with
herbert
compton
no
one
whether
european
or
native
could
approach
this
spot
without
feelings
of
horror
for
the
lonely
rock
stood
alone
in
the
plain
and
the
fearful
use
to
which
it
had
been
devoted
both
by
hyder
and
tippoo
was
fresh
in
the
memory
of
all
a
few
in
the
force
had
seen
and
examined
it
and
philip
dalton
and
charles
rode
thither
accompanied
by
a
few
mounted
orderlies
on
the
very
first
opportunity
of
leisure
a
silent
feeling
of
sickening
apprehension
grew
upon
them
as
they
approached
it
and
a
thought
would
force
itself
upon
philip
despite
of
his
hopes
and
prayers
to
the
contrary
that
herbert
s
fate
might
have
been
the
dreadful
one
experienced
by
the
hundreds
whose
whitened
bones
and
skulls
lay
around
the
foot
of
the
rock
but
he
did
not
mention
this
to
his
companion
and
they
rode
on
in
silence
at
length
they
reached
the
rock
and
leaving
their
horses
below
ascended
to
the
top
where
still
stood
though
somewhat
dilapidated
the
small
hut
or
house
we
have
once
mentioned
but
this
did
not
attract
their
notice
at
first
the
fatal
brink
which
had
witnessed
the
frantic
of
so
many
was
the
spot
to
which
they
were
led
by
the
orderlies
who
had
a
hundred
marvellous
tales
to
tell
of
events
that
happened
there
and
of
the
tremendous
strength
of
those
whose
business
it
was
to
hurl
the
victims
from
the
precipice
they
looked
over
too
and
saw
the
bones
and
skulls
scattered
at
the
bottom
and
shreds
of
white
calico
and
red
cloth
fluttering
among
the
sad
evidence
of
the
fate
of
brave
soldiers
who
had
perished
there
there
was
nothing
there
to
induce
them
to
remain
and
philip
and
his
young
friend
turned
away
sickened
from
the
spot
and
this
is
the
place
where
the
unfortunate
persons
were
confined
said
an
orderly
who
pushing
open
a
rude
and
door
ushered
them
into
a
mean
and
dilapidated
apartment
good
god
it
is
covered
with
the
names
of
poor
fellows
who
have
died
here
exclaimed
philip
what
if
should
be
here
we
must
not
leave
an
inch
unexamined
why
do
you
think
he
was
ever
here
asked
the
young
man
in
an
agitated
tone
god
forbid
but
it
is
our
duty
to
look
we
may
possibly
gain
a
and
they
fell
to
examining
the
walls
with
careful
scrutiny
it
was
a
painful
task
there
were
many
names
the
hands
which
had
written
them
were
now
dry
bones
bleaching
without
or
had
long
ago
mouldered
into
dust
many
were
the
humble
prayers
written
there
and
obscene
words
and
curses
mingled
with
them
in
strange
combination
many
a
direction
too
for
parents
and
wives
and
children
of
those
who
were
dead
in
case
others
might
visit
the
spot
and
bear
them
to
the
far
west
heavens
exclaimed
young
hayward
suddenly
come
here
philip
quick
dalton
darted
across
the
apartment
and
charles
pointed
to
a
small
writing
scratched
in
the
plaster
with
a
pin
or
nail
it
was
plain
even
to
his
swimming
eyes
and
sickened
heart
herbert
compton
may
many
have
been
thrown
from
this
abode
of
death
i
have
waited
my
turn
it
will
come
it
will
deliver
me
from
a
life
of
misery
there
was
no
stone
flung
against
the
wall
had
hit
the
rest
and
obliterated
it
philip
sank
down
and
groaned
aloud
that
there
should
be
such
an
end
to
his
hopes
which
this
proved
to
have
had
foundation
was
hard
indeed
to
bear
awhile
charles
strove
to
comfort
him
but
both
their
hearts
were
sick
and
they
were
poor
comforters
one
to
another
there
may
be
further
trace
of
him
said
philip
let
us
look
they
did
so
for
a
while
they
found
nothing
but
at
length
a
joyful
cry
again
broke
forth
from
charles
god
be
praised
he
said
come
here
and
read
the
writing
on
the
wall
was
rough
and
misshapen
but
they
were
characters
of
blessed
hope
to
both
the
words
were
these
captin
comtin
was
taking
awey
from
this
horible
pleace
verry
ill
on
the
day
john
god
be
praised
for
this
exclaimed
philip
as
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
blessed
him
aloud
there
is
yet
hope
for
assuredly
he
did
not
perish
here
chapter
xl
these
are
too
precious
to
remain
here
charles
said
philip
we
must
remove
it
was
easily
done
with
their
they
carefully
cut
round
the
plaster
of
each
inscription
and
then
separated
it
from
the
wall
without
difficulty
they
were
precious
relics
and
the
young
men
long
gazed
on
them
with
that
depth
of
feeling
which
such
memorials
were
well
calculated
to
excite
ah
philip
if
we
could
only
trace
him
further
said
charles
we
thought
not
of
this
when
we
came
hither
he
replied
and
we
should
be
thankful
it
is
just
possible
that
some
one
in
the
town
may
have
heard
tidings
of
him
if
he
were
really
ill
and
we
will
go
thither
and
they
did
not
tarry
on
the
rock
for
an
instant
their
horses
awaited
them
at
the
bottom
and
the
distance
between
the
rock
and
the
small
town
being
quickly
traversed
they
arrived
in
the
bazaar
philip
directly
made
for
the
chouree
where
the
former
kotwal
and
others
sat
engaged
in
their
functions
of
superintending
the
market
and
directing
the
issues
of
grain
and
forage
to
the
followers
of
the
british
army
they
were
received
courteously
by
the
functionary
who
was
all
civility
to
his
late
conquerors
philip
at
once
opened
the
cause
of
his
visit
and
expressed
his
anxiety
for
intelligence
however
vague
of
his
lost
friend
the
kotwal
racked
his
brains
or
appeared
to
do
so
he
could
remember
nothing
about
the
rock
or
its
victims
being
fearful
lest
he
should
compromise
himself
by
some
unlucky
remark
or
confession
so
many
had
perished
there
he
said
it
was
the
sultaun
s
order
and
in
balapoor
they
never
knew
anything
about
but
was
no
one
ever
brought
here
asked
philip
really
he
could
not
remember
so
many
went
and
came
how
could
he
the
kotwal
who
saw
a
thousand
new
faces
every
day
retain
a
recollection
of
any
prisoners
too
in
hundreds
passed
remaining
there
for
a
day
but
he
never
saw
them
he
had
no
curiosity
he
had
other
business
he
was
in
fact
the
kotwal
upon
whom
rested
all
the
affairs
of
the
philip
was
in
despair
can
you
get
me
no
information
he
said
i
do
not
speak
the
native
language
and
to
me
inquiry
is
of
course
if
my
lord
wished
it
he
would
make
every
inquiry
and
in
truth
he
began
in
earnest
with
those
about
him
none
however
could
remember
anything
but
vague
descriptions
of
prisoners
passing
and
repassing
and
philip
after
a
long
and
patient
investigation
which
led
to
no
result
was
about
to
depart
disappointed
and
vexed
when
a
man
entered
who
had
been
absent
on
some
message
he
was
one
of
the
labourers
or
scouts
of
the
village
and
the
kotwal
immediately
said
to
philip
if
any
one
can
give
you
the
information
you
seek
it
is
this
man
for
it
was
his
business
to
attend
upon
the
sultaun
s
people
who
came
hither
with
he
was
immediately
questioned
and
gave
ready
answers
he
perfectly
remembered
a
feringhee
who
was
brought
ill
and
long
remained
at
the
fakeer
s
tukea
beyond
the
town
lying
upon
the
chubootra
they
were
told
he
was
an
officer
and
an
order
came
to
him
from
the
sultaun

surely
cried
the
kotwal
whose
memory
appeared
wonderfully
refreshed
tis
strange
i
should
have
forgotten
him
seeing
that
he
was
often
fed
from
my
house
women
you
know
sahib
have
tender
hearts
even
for
those
of
a
different
faith
and
we
knew
nothing
of
the
brave

canst
thou

said
philip
to
the
man
who
could
speak
indifferent
hindostanee
certainly
he
replied
tis
but
a
short
and
so
saying
he
took
up
his
long
staff
philip
rose
to
depart
i
will
accompany
you
sir
said
the
kotwal
the
old
sein
is
very
curious
in
his
behaviour
to
strangers
and
may
not
be
civil
besides
he
hath
been
ill
of

respectful
appellation
of
a

i
thank
you
returned
philip
but
i
would
prefer
going
alone
i
have
no
doubt
the
old
man
will
be
reasonable
even
to
a
feringhee
salaam
guided
by
the
scout
who
ran
before
their
horses
they
were
quickly
at
the
garden
we
have
before
mentioned
it
had
been
respected
by
all
the
little
mosque
was
as
purely
clean
the
space
around
it
as
neatly
swept
as
ever
the
flowers
bloomed
around
the
tiny
fountain
and
the
noble
trees
overshadowed
all
as
closely
as
when
sick
and
exhausted
herbert
compton
lay
beneath
their
shade
and
blessed
god
that
he
had
found
such
a
refuge
and
such
a
friend
as
the
old
fakeer
the
venerable
old
man
sat
in
his
usual
spot
under
the
before
him
was
his
koran
which
he
read
in
a
monotonous
tone
his
face
was
very
thin
and
he
looked
weak
and
attenuated
by
sickness

said
philip
advancing
we

the

benignantly
ye

allowed

philip
much
touched
by
the
benevolence
of
his
tone
and
appearance
thou
art
no
bigot
and
wilt
aid
us
if
thou
canst
i
seek
a
lost
friend
as
dear
to
me
as
a
brother
i
know
not
if
it
be
the
same
but
i
have
heard
that
one
of
my
race
was
tended
by
thee
and
remained
ill
with
thee
for
long
it
may
be
he
didst

alla
cried
the

eagerly
art

him
who
loved
me
as
a
son
alas
i
know
not
his
name
his
name
it
and
he
fell
to
musing
his
forefinger
between
his
teeth
i
can
not
remember
it
now
he
said
though
it
is
daily
on
my
lips
compton
said
philip
the
same
the
same
cried
the
old
man
the
compton
the
name
is
music
to
me
sahib
i
loved
that
youth
for
he
was
gentle
and
often
told
me
of
your
cool
and
beautiful
land
in
the
distant
west
where
the
sun
goes
down
in
glory
and
he
taught
me
to
love
the
race
i
heard
reviled
and
alla
will
reward
thee
said
philip
but
canst
thou
tell
me
anything
respecting
his
fate
alas
nothing
for
a
month
he
was
with
me
ill
very
thought
he
would
die
but
the
prayers
of
the
old
fakeer
were
heard
and
the
medicines
of
his
hand
were
blessed
and
once
more
he
spoke
with
reason
and
grew
calm
and
the
fever
left
him
then
when
his
strength
returned
an
order
from
the
sultaun
arrived
and
it
was
a
bold
bad
man
that
brought
it
and
he
was
taken
away
from
me
and
never
since
that
have
i
gained
any
tidings
of
him
may
his
destiny
have
been
good
my
prayers
have
been
night
and
day
for
him
to
that
being
who
is
your
god
and
philip
was
much
touched
and
poured
out
his
thanks
to
the
old
man
most
sincerely
and
with
a
full
heart
alas
i
fear
all
trace
of
him
is
lost
he
said
say
not
so
my
son
i
i
hope
the
sultaun
is
not
always
is
just
his
death
was
never
life
was
too
valuable
for
that
he
is
most
likely
at
seringapatam
whither
ye
are
proceeding
they
would
not
despair
and
now
listen
alla
hath
sent
thee
hither
thou
who
wast
his
friend
he
gave
me
a
letter
a
packet
which
he
wrote
here
in
secret
i
would
ere
this
have
delivered
it
in
thy
camp
but
i
am
grown
very
feeble
and
infirm
of
late
the
effect
of
illness
and
i
could
not
walk
so
far
wilt
thou
receive
it
to
me
it
has
been
a
memorial
of
the
young
man
and
i
have
looked
on
it
often
and
remembered
his
beautiful
features
and
his
gratitude
when
i
risked
this
my
little
possession
which
to
me
is
a
paradise
in
taking
it
from
eagerly
most
eagerly
philip
implored
to
see
it
and
the
fakeer
rising
attempted
to
walk
to
his
humble
residence
but
with
difficulty
philip
and
charles
flew
to
his
aid
and
leaning
on
them
as
he
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
with
evident
pleasure
the
old
man
reached
the
door
remain
here
he
said
the
dwelling
is
are
better
here
i
will
return
to
he
did
so
in
a
few
minutes
bearing
the
packet
philip
took
it
with
a
delight
he
had
no
words
to
express
and
was
well
nigh
overpowered
by
his
emotion
as
the
familiar
handwriting
met
his
eye
there
can
be
no
doubt
he
said
that
it
was
would
swear
to
his
handwriting
among
a
do
not
open
it
here
said
the
fakeer
but
sit
and
speak
to
me
of
him
and
his
parents
and
his
beloved
for
i
heard
all
continued
the
old
man
with
a
sigh
and
pitied
his
sad
philip
told
him
all
and
they
talked
for
hours
over
the
lost
one
he
told
him
how
he
had
gone
to
england
and
married
his
sister
how
the
youth
beside
them
was
her
brother
of
whom
he
had
heard
and
then
the
old
man
blessed
the
youth
thou
wilt
not
be
the
worse
that
i
have
done
so
he
said
while
a
tear
filled
his
there
for
a
welling
over
trickled
down
his
furrowed
cheek
and
was
lost
in
his
white
beard
long
long
they
talked
together
and
the
day
was
fast
declining
ere
they
left
him
promising
to
return
whenever
they
could
they
took
away
the
precious
packet
with
them
to
pore
over
its
contents
together
in
philip
s
tent
they
opened
it
with
eager
anxiety
it
was
addressed
to
any
english
there
were
a
few
lines
from
herbert
informing
whomsoever
should
receive
it
that
he
was
alive
and
imploring
him
to
forward
it
to
the
government
and
a
few
more
descriptive
of
his
captivity
of
his
escape
from
the
rock
and
his
uncertainty
for
the
future
there
were
letters
too
to
be
forwarded
one
to
his
father
one
to
amy
another
for
philip
himself
which
he
opened
impatiently
it
was
said
he
dared
not
write
much
he
described
his
various
trials
and
sufferings
and
the
kindness
of
the
old
fakeer
without
whose
aid
he
must
have
perished
he
besought
him
not
to
despair
of
finding
him
alive
even
though
years
should
intervene
between
that
time
and
when
the
letter
should
reach
him
nor
will
i
despair
dear
herbert
cried
philip
never
never
the
hand
of
providence
is
clearly
discernible
through
all
this
chain
of
events
it
will
lead
us
charles
to
the
close
yet
we
must
be
secret
these
letters
must
not
be
delivered
nor
must
our
present
success
be
known
in
england
till
we
can
confirm
the
glad
tidings
or
for
ever
there
was
not
a
day
while
the
army
remained
there
that
the
friends
did
not
visit
the
old
fakeer
they
could
not
prevail
on
him
to
accept
money
but
there
were
articles
which
were
of
use
to
and
blankets
and
other
trivial
things
which
he
received
gladly
they
left
him
with
sorrow
and
with
little
hope
that
they
should
ever
renew
their
intercourse
with
him
yet
they
met
again
the
progress
of
the
army
was
slow
for
the
forage
except
in
a
few
places
had
been
destroyed
and
the
draught
and
carriage
bullocks
died
by
hundreds
the
nizam
s
force
too
had
joined
the
british
army
and
it
presented
a
most
gorgeous
eastern
display
far
more
imposing
than
any
philip
had
yet
seen
men
of
all
nations
of
the
east
and
tribes
of
india
the
courtly
persian
the
reckless
afghan
the
wild
beloche
the
sturdy
pathan
the
more
slender
and
effeminate
dukhanee
the
chivalrous
rajpoot
and
hardy
mahrattas
all
were
mingled
in
a
wild
hardly
belonging
to
any
corps
and
clustered
round
every
leader
s
standard
apparently
as
fancy
or
caprice
or
hope
of
plunder
dictated
the
force
was
utterly
inefficient
however
for
the
purposes
of
the
war
for
the
leader
had
no
control
over
it
nor
could
he
supply
it
with
food
and
his
fidelity
to
the
english
cause
if
not
the
nizam
s
also
was
questionable
at
every
day
s
march
the
distress
of
the
army
increased
men
were
upon
the
lowest
rations
the
cavalry
were
almost
inefficient
from
the
starvation
and
weakness
of
their
horses
and
the
active
and
irregular
cloud
of
the
nizam
s
horse
consumed
what
little
forage
was
left
in
the
country
long
ere
it
could
be
collected
by
the
english
the
leaves
of
mango
and
other
trees
where
they
could
be
procured
were
even
gladly
devoured
by
the
starved
cattle
in
lieu
of
other
food
nevertheless
in
spite
of
these
discouraging
prospects
the
army
advanced
by
slow
marches
and
as
the
heat
was
the
height
of
the
of
mysore
from
three
to
four
thousand
feet
gives
it
a
temperate
climate
at
all
seasons
of
the
troops
long
accustomed
only
to
the
enervating
climate
of
coromandel
gained
fresh
vigour
and
health
as
they
proceeded
meanwhile
the
advance
of
the
english
though
he
often
affected
to
despise
it
was
a
source
of
the
greatest
alarm
to
the
sultaun
in
vain
had
he
consulted
the
stars
in
vain
tried
magical
arts
they
still
proceeded
and
drew
nearer
to
his
capital
daily
nevertheless
he
heard
accounts
of
the
distress
and
famine
prevalent
in
the
english
camp
and
could
he
only
gain
time
even
by
negotiation
or
by
retreat
he
might
protract
the
campaign
so
that
the
english
would
be
obliged
to
retreat
and
he
would
then
pour
upon
them
his
whole
force
and
annihilate
them
for
ever
night
after
night
was
occupied
in
discussions
with
his
chief
advisers

kishun
rao
and
purnea
but
their
counsel
was
hardly
listened
to
in
the
wild
schemes
which
were
revolving
in
his
mind
our
government
is
the
gift
of
god
he
would
cry

kafirs
who
heap
abuse
on
the
name
of
mohamed
his

retained
jaffar
always
about
his
person
he
was
spy
plotter
adviser
executioner
by
turns
that
before
the
action
which
followed
at
were
alone
in
the
sultaun
s
tent
all
had
left
him
and
he
was
uneasy
and
fretful
no
wonder
for
his
thoughts
at
night
were
terrible
and
he
could
not
bear
to
be
alone
he
had
summoned
one
of
his
favourite
ladies
from
the
city
and
sought
in
her
society
a
respite
from
his
thoughts
all
was
in
vain
he
could
not
shut
out
from
himself
his
danger
though
he
scoffed
at
it
openly
and
thou
hast
seen
him
jaffar
and
spoken
with
him
i
have
he
is
a
conceited
arrogant
man
to
be
man
whose
rapacity
is
not
to
be
and
what
said
he
he
was
haughty
at
first
and
it
was
hard
to
hear
how
he
spoke
of
thee
o
sultaun
the
monarch
gnashed
his
teeth
ya
alla
grant
me
power
to
chastise
those
who
mock
thy
favourite
he
cried
looking
up
devoutly
but
thou
gavest
the
letter
i
and
the
bills
for
money
yes
he
said
he
would
forward
that
to
the
prince
at
and
will
he
fight
against
me
will
he
not
come
over
at
once
and
desert
them
he
dare
not
but
he
will
be
neutral
i
think
but
he
is
well
where
he
is
his
presence
is
a
burthen
to
the
kafir
feringhees
they
wish
his
men
devour
the
forage
and
they
starve
ha
ha
ha
good
jaffar
now

worse
why
shouldst
thou
hesitate
speak

mind
fully
death
said
the
other
in
a
hollow
tone
as
if
he
feared
the
very
echo
of
the
words
good
said
the
sultaun
but
his
lip
quivered
as
he
spoke
thou
wilt
require
a
warrant
write
one
i
will
seal
i
can
not
write
o
pah
why
are

such
fools

enough
begone
thou
must
return
by
this
time
i
have
more
work
for
on
my
head
and
eyes
be
it
he
said
and
departed
from
the
tent
the
sultaun
could
not
bear
to
be
alone
he
arose
and
entered
the
inner
apartments
the
lady
was
alone
she
was
very
beautiful
and
very
fair
for
her
country
her
soft
melting
eye
spoke
of
other
love
than
that
of
the
cold
sultaun
s
and
its
expression
was
much
heightened
by
the
deep
black
tinge
she
had
given
to
her
eyelids
her
dress
was
the
purest
white
muslin
woven
with
silver
flowers
which
she
had
thrown
over
her
gracefully
and
which
partially
covered
a
petticoat
of
most
gorgeous
the
floor
of
the
tent
was
covered
with
fine
white
calico
and
on
one
side
was
a
low
couch
on
the
other
a
crimson
satin
mattress
which
formed
a
dais
furnished
with
pillows
of
blue
velvet
she
arose
and
made
a
graceful
salutation
but
did
not
speak
for
his
brow
was
knit
into
a
frown
which
she
feared
and
he
was
not
safe
when
he
looked
so
he
threw
himself
upon
the
dais
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
he
was
long
silent
but
she
dared
not
address
him
he
spoke
at
last
to
himself
and
she
could
hear
every
word
in
the
still
silence
it
is
my
destiny
he
said
the
destiny
of
my
house
the
brahmin
who
warned
who
spoke
out
against
me
fearless
of
death
and
now
lives
in
the
dungeon
yonder
he
told
me
of
the
feringhees
whence
is
their
mighty
power
they
roll
on
a
fierce
tide
against
me
is
there
no
hope
ah
for
one
hour
of
his
presence
who
was
ever
victorious
over
father
but
he
is
gone
for
ever
and
i
am
the
girl
was
touched
she
drew
nearer
to
him
men
of
islam
he
resumed
after
a
pause
will
ye
not
fight
for
me
why
should
i
fear
alla
akbar
assud
ali
is
false
he
has
taken
the
money
and
the
letter
pah
i
have
humbled
myself
to
that
proud
nizam
him
who
trampled
on
me
and
scorned
my
alliance
but
no
matter
we
may
be
even
with
him
yet
assud
ali
is
false
to
his
cause
and
will
aid
mine
ya
alla
kureem
that
he
may
then
the
mahrattas
will
follow
they
are
keep
will
see
how
the
game
goes
and
join
the
winners
why
should
i
fear
zeman
shah
in
the
north
with
the
afghans
then
the
men
of
delhi
and
the
rohillas
the
hill
tribes
the
french
are
now
wary
and
cool
but
they
will
rise
one
action
over
and
all
is
safe
then
conquest
comes
and
these
hateful
sons
of
satan
are
driven
away
for
at
last
he
was
silent
there
were
visions
of
gorgeous
triumphs
passing
through
his
heart
which
defied
words
to
express
them
he
looked
up
and
his
eyes
met
those
of
the
lady
come
hither
he
said
and
sit
by
me
thine
eyes
are
full
of
love
they
are
not
like
those
of
men
abroad
when
i
look
into
theirs
i
read
distrust
faithlessness
i
doubt
them
all
fureeda
they
know
of
many
things
which
were
they
to
tell
the
no
they
dare
not
what
thinkest
thou
goes
the
game
i
am
your
slave
she
said
but
i
will
tell
the
truth
men
say
thou
dost
not
fight
and
they
are
gloomy
why
are
not
the
troops
of
the
sircar
led
on
against
the
kafirs
why
are
they
kept
in
idleness
retreating
day
by
day
where
are
thy
valiant
thy
thy
invincible
and
thundering
cavalry
arouse
thee
o
my
lord
let
even
a
slave
s
voice
aid
that
of
thy
who
would
fain
see
the
glory
of
the
faith
exalted
and
the
tiger
of
mysore
rend
to
pieces

kafir
english
art

and
a
soldier

thy
place

said
her
eye
flashing
i
would
mount
my
horse
and
cry
bismilla
as
i
led
my
warriors
to
victory
art
thou
a
coward
coward
sayest
thou
this
to
me
cried
the
sultaun
gnashing
his
teeth
as
his
small
dagger
flashed
from
its
scabbard
in
his
girdle
and
was
upraised
to
strike
the
lady
trembled
but
bowed
low
before
him
strike
she
said
i
can
die
at
thy
feet
the
lonely
fureeda
will
not
be
missed
upon
the
earth
all
who
loved
me
are
dead

well
knowest
and
my
spirit
yearns
to
be
with
theirs
strike
i
am
and
dost
thou
think
me
a
coward
fureeda
he
exclaimed
as
his
hand
dropped
alla
and
the
prophet
forbid
i
know
thou
art
brave
but
men
complain
they
tell
thee
not
of
it
but
they
complain
that
the
old
fire
is
quenched
within
thee
i
who

it
is
not
by
alla
i

will
see
what
the
morrow
brings
the
night
is
gloomy
and
hot
there
may
be
that
they
will
be
helpless
then
we
will
set
on
them
and
cry
alla
yar
now
get
thee
to
thy
bed
the
night
advances
and
we
would
be
alone
for
visions

on
us
which
we
would
record
for
those
destined
to
follow
our
she
left
him
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
but
could
not
sleep
the
night
was
oppressive
and
she
watched
him
he
wrote
awhile
then
she
saw
him
put
aside
his
paper
and
lie
had
come
to
him
she
arose
took
a
light
shawl
and
threw
it
over
him
gently
then
she
sat
down
and
watched
him
presently
the
thunder
muttered
in
the
distance
and
flash
after
flash
of
blue
lightning
penetrated
through
the
tent
dimming
the
light
of
the
lamp
which
burned
beside
him
the
thunder
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
the
loud
patter
of
heavy
rain
upon
the
canvas
of
the
tent
she
thought
would
have
awakened
him
but
he
slept
on
she
was
naturally
terrified
at
thunder
but
she
did
not
relinquish
her
watch
for
he
was
restless
and
disturbed
in
his
sleep
now
and
then
he
muttered
names
and
she
could
hear
him
when
the
roar
of
the
thunder
ceased
for
an
instant
or
two
soon
his
dreams
were
more
distinct
and
she
shuddered
as
she
listened
jaffar
he
said
jaffar

with
them
to
the
not
yet
not
kill
them
yet
there

two

then
after
awhile
his
sleep
was
more
uneasy
she
saw
his
brows
knit
and
his
hands
clench
fast

and
then
he
was
quiet
for
a
while
but
big
drops
of
sweat
stood
on
his
brow
she
would
have
given
worlds
to
wake
him
she
wondered
the
thunder
did
not
for
peal
after
peal
crashed
overhead
once
more
he
spoke
it
was
very

there
was
a
crash
of
thunder
which
seemed
to
rend
the
flash
of
lightning
which
almost
blinded
her
fureeda
cowered
to
the
ground
as
the
sultaun
started
up
his
eyes
glaring
and
his
hands
clenched
and
thrust
out
before
him
as
he
looked
wildly
around

chapter
xli
it
was
truly
an
awful
night
the
wind
howled
in
fierce
blasts
over
the
plain
driving
with
it
cold
and
piercing
rain
which
benumbed
men
who
had
only
been
accustomed
to
the
heat
of
the
carnatic
and
the
coast
the
bullocks
and
horses
of
the
cavalry
exhausted
by
dearth
of
food
could
no
longer
struggle
through
the
mud
and
fell
in
great
numbers
to
rise
no
more
then
men
applied
their
shoulders
to
the
wheels
and
laid
hold
of
the
of
the
guns
with
wild
energy
and
urged
them
on
with
loud
shouts
and
cries
everywhere
the
most
appalling
confusion
existed
for
the
enemy
was
in
front
at
a
short
distance
and
with
their
knowledge
of
the
ground
and
of
the
country
what
might
not
be
effected
during
such
a
night
but
it
was
too
wild
even
for
the
enemy
to
venture
forth
to
an
attack
which
might
after
all
be
doubtful
the
thunder
roared
and
crashed
overhead
in
stunning
peals
men
shouted
but
were
not
heard
there
was
no
road
to
be
discovered
and
infantry
and
cavalry
often
mingled
together
floundered
on
in
the
inky
darkness
amongst
the
rest
the
commander
vainly
strove
to
track
the
road
but
soon
lost
it
and
with
his
staff
wandered
they
knew
not
whither
while
parties
of
the
enemies
horse
were
everywhere
abroad
it
was
a
fearful
risk
for
one
on
whom
so
much
depended
they
halted
at
length
upon
a
rising
ground
but
could
distinguish
only
wild
groups
of
struggling
figures
as
the
vivid
lightning
disclosed
them
for
instants
only
at
a
time
everywhere
around
them
sometimes
it
appeared
as
if
the
enemy
were
surrounding
them
for
the
deep
booming
sound
of
their
and
the
wild
shrill
neighing
of
horses
came
clearly
upon
the
blast
at
intervals
and
in
the
distance
they
often
thought
they
could
see
masses
of
troops
marshalled
in
array
and
the
lightning
flashing
from
the
points
of
spears
and
bayonets
their
situation
was
very
precarious
and
philip
and
some
others
essayed
to
find
the
way
back
to
the
point
from
which
they
had
set
out
and
after
much
difficulty
they
succeeded
plunging
through
a
ploughed
field
alone
he
found
a
road
beyond
and
venturing
slowly
and
cautiously
heard
through
the
din
of
thunder
and
roar
of
the
wind
the
welcome
sound
of
english
voices
it
was
enough
he
retraced
his
steps
to
the
place
where
he
had
left
his
general
by
the
glare
of
the
lightning
and
gave
him
the
welcome
news
he
was
eagerly
followed
and
once
more
the
commander
was
placed
in
safety
the
wind
and
the
rain
ceased
gradually
the
storm
passed
onwards
and
a
few
stars
shone
out
here
and
there
gradually
heralding
the
brilliant
dawn
it
broke
at
length
to
the
expectant
eyes
of
that
wearied
army
and
in
a
short
time
the
confusion
of
the
night
before
was
restored
men
repaired
to
their
proper
standards
and
discipline
was
once
more
restored
with
the
earliest
dawn
the
sultaun
had
been
astir
and
calling
to
him
the
leaders
upon
whom
he
most
depended
he
gave
orders
for
an
assault
upon
the
exhausted
english
they
will
be
our
prey
he
said
let
them
come
on
let
them
fall
into
the
trap
which
destiny
has
marked
out
for
them
shookr
alla
they
have
come
so
far
that
to
retreat
is
must
advance
into
our
hands
go
in
the
name
of
the
most
mighty
go
and
conquer
your
destiny
is
bright
this
day
will
be
a
fair
one
for
the
honour
of
islam
a
day
which
men
shall
record
in
history
and
the
nations
of
the
west
tremble
at
when
they
hear
the
leaders
wondered
what
had
so
suddenly
changed
his
resolution
of
not
giving
battle
for
the
day
before
he
had
been
obstinately
bent
upon
retreat
into
the
city
but
they
were
glad
for
the
troops
were
loud
in
their
murmurs
and
retreat
day
after
day
before
a
weakened
enemy
was
fast
undermining
any
notions
of
discipline
or
subordination
which
still
remained
they
obeyed
his
various
orders
with
alacrity
and
as
the
light
became
broader
and
clearer
and
the
english
army
could
be
descried
a
shower
of
rockets
was
directed
against
it
which
although
annoying
was
of
little
effect
the
sultaun
looked
on
from
a
rising
ground
before
him
the
two
armies
were
spread
out
his
own
cushoons
in
large
masses
for
the
while
inactive
with
the
long
lines
and
columns
of
the
english
opposed
to
them
and
the
artillery
vainly
endeavouring
to
get
the
guns
into
position
the
cattle
were
exhausted
and
could
hardly
move
he
saw
the
annoyance
the
rockets
caused
and
exulted
shabash
shabash
give
them
more
ride
khan

he
said
to
an
officer
near
him
and
tell
them
not
to
spare

rockets
and
the
shot

fall
into
the

he
would
have
led
the
charge
ha
there
is
no
turn
they
turn
the
less
than
but
his
exultation
was
soon
checked
for
when
the
lines
of
redcoats
advanced
he
saw
his
own
cushoons
retire
and
one
fell
into
confusion
assud
ali
and
his
cloud
of
cavalry
were
close
upon
sultaun
was
in
agony
if
he
is
true
to
me

cried

shall
be
ready
to
meet
and
he
retreated
that
day
to
his
fortified
position
under
the
guns
of
the
fort
the
english
took
up
his
late
position
upon
the
field
and
advanced
even
beyond
it
but
the
distress
in
the
army
was
frightful
and
there
was
no
prospect
of
relief
abercromby
who
it
had
been
hoped
would
have
joined
it
was
not
to
be
heard
of
nor
were
the
mahrattas
there
was
no
blade
of
grass
even
the
trees
had
been
destroyed
most
of
the
wells
and
tanks
were
poisoned
by
branches
of
euphorbium
thrown
into
them
the
cattle
grew
weaker
and
weaker
and
died
by
hundreds
no
man
had
hope
that
before
the
efficient
army
of
the
sultaun
and
against
a
strong
fort
there
could
be
any
possible
hope
of
victory
and
all
looked
anxiously
for
the
decision
of
him
who
led
them
on
it
was
on
the
evening
of
that
day
that
philip
dalton
and
charles
hayward
ascended
a
small
hill
near
the
camp
and
looked
forth
over
the
glorious
view
which
was
spread
out
before
them
a
few
miles
distant
was
the
city
the
tall
minarets
of
the
mosque
in
the
fort
and
here
and
there
a
small
dome
with
clusters
of
houses
sparkling
among
the
thick
groves
which
surrounded
them
the
long
lines
of
the
regular
walls
of
the
fort
and
their
tall
cavaliers
could
be
seen
and
in
the
plain
before
them
redoubts
were
everywhere
thrown
up
between
which
the
gay
tents
of
the
huge
army
glittered
in
the
evening
sun
for
a
flood
of
golden
light
poured
upon
the
city
and
the
camp
from
the
declining
sun
and
as
the
light
evening
clouds
sailed
slowly
on
the
view
was
chequered
by
soft
shadows
which
added
to
the
beauty
of
the
scene
the
broad
cavery
glittered
where
waters
stood
deep
in
pools
and
its
broad
and
rocky
bed
could
be
seen
around
the
fort
and
town
and
stretching
far
away
to
the
western
hills
there
was
no
bridge
across
the
river
but
with
his
telescope
philip
could
make
out
the
ruins
of
that
which
had
been
destroyed
in
all
directions
columns
of
white
smoke
were
ascending
straight
into
the
air
from
the
burning
villages
which
had
been
fired
lest
they
should
afford
protection
or
shelter
to
the
enemy
both
were
long
silent
as
they
sat
looking
upon
the
prospect
for
their
thoughts
were
sad
and
the
hope
which
had
filled
their
hearts
when
they
had
left
bangalore
victorious
trusting
soon
to
be
before
seringapatam
and
to
see
the
sultaun
humbled
and
the
captives
of
years
brought
forth
in
triumph
had
now
given
place
to
despair
for
the
delay
even
of
a
day
was
perilous
to
the
whole
army
and
already
the
determination
had
been
made
of
destroying
the
battering
train
and
retreating
until
a
better
system
of
supply
for
the
army
could
be
organised
and
the
strength
of
the
exhausted
cattle
restored
poor
fellow
said
was
thinking
of
herbert
compton
as
the
city
lay
before
him
if
he
be
immured
in
a
dungeon
yonder
he
will
have
heard
our
firing
he
will
have
known
of
our
advance
and
we
can
not
conceive
the
state
of
anxiety
and
suspense
he
must
be
in
and
how
dreadful
will
be
his
are
we
then
to
retreat
philip
i
believe
it
is
so
determined
he
replied
for
the
public
cause
it
is
good
for
we
shall
have
gained
experience
but
we
shall
return
soon
i
trust
charles
i
hope
and
trust
in
a
short
time
when
forage
is
more
plentiful
and
for
you
proud
sultaun
he
said
looking
towards
the
city
there
is
a
severe
reckoning
in
store
oh
my
poor
herbert
if
thou
art
there
may
god
preserve
you
to
a
deliverance
at
our
hands
but
now
the
evening
was
fast
closing
in
and
the
fires
of
the
sultaun
s
army
were
sparkling
in
the
dusky
plain
gradually
but
quickly
the
city
was
fading
before
their
sight
and
the
quiet
pools
of
the
cavery
wherein
the
deep
yellow
and
orange
of
the
sky
was
reflected
shone
more
brightly
amidst
the
gloom
around
them
there
was
no
use
in
staying
longer
and
they
arose
and
returned
to
the
camp
in
a
few
days
having
destroyed
the
noble
the
army
retreated
towards
bangalore
the
sultaun
sat
on
the
high
cavalier
which
stands
at
the
southeast
angle
of
the
fort
surrounded
by
his
officers
the
busy
camp
of
the
english
was
within
sight
in
which
it
was
plain
that
there
was
a
movement
he
was
gloomy
and
dispirited
in
spite
of
the
force
around
him
which
was
ostentatiously
displayed
there
was
a
secret
misgiving
in
his
heart
a
dread
of
private
treachery
of
the
unfaithfulness
of
the
army
though
one
and
all
had
sworn
to
defend
their
trust
the
men
around
him
hardly
spoke
but
in
whispers
they
will
be
upon
us
soon
said
the
khan
to
kasim
who
stood
by
him
and
the
thunder
of
the
english
cannon
will
be
heard
for
the
first
time
at
seringapatam
ya
alla
avert
it
for
their
destiny
is
shame
on
thee
khan
cried
the
young
man
let
them
for
one
will
welcome
a
stroke
against
the
kafirs
i
have
not
drawn
a
sword
for
months
and
am
tired
of
this
thou
art
not
strong
yet
as
i
ever
was

my
arm
its
sinews
are
as
firmly
knit
as
ever
let
them
come
i
say
and
alla

right
are
we
not
the
children
of
the
faith
and
they
are
infidels
kasim
ali
where
is
kasim
ali
cried
the
voice
of
the
sultaun
he
answered
and
stepped
forward
look
through
this
continued
the
monarch
handing
his
telescope
to
the
young
man
tell
me
what
thou
seest
for
by
alla
i
can
not
believe
mine
own
cowards
cried
the
young
man
after
a
moment
they
retreat
their
backs
are
towards
alla
hu
akbar
ya
alla
kureem
cried
the
sultaun
then
our
prayers
have
been
listened
to
ha
ha
ha
they
kafir
dogs
they
are
after
them
my
their
steps
to
the
very
gates
of

inshalla
our
hunt

be
cornwallis
a

to
him
who
brings
us
his
head
now
are
our
dreams
come
true
our
visions
wherein
we
have
trusted
be
not
deceived
my
friends
behold
the
proofs
that
i
am
the
favoured
of
the
prophet
and
that
though
sometimes
the
power
of
prophecy
is
withdrawn
from
us
yet
the
light
which
is
within
us
burns
still
and
will
never
be
extinguished
away
ye
of
the
household
cavalry
kasim
ali
rhyman
khan
away
after
them
not
too
far
prudence
and
wariness
have
won
us
this
victory
we
must
not
abuse
it
ye
must
return
in
three
days
when
we
will
determine
upon
future
operations
begone
but
as
they
prepared
hastily
for
the
service
the
movement
was
countermanded
to
the
bitter
disappointment
of
kasim
ali
for
the
sultaun
feared
risking
his
best
horse
against
the
combined
forces
of
the
english
and
the
nizam
s
cavalry
and
ordered
them
to
remain
nor
was
there
for
a
considerable
period
any
movement
of
interest
strange
it
was
that
he
made
no
attack
upon
the
retiring
english
nor
any
effort
to
retake
bangalore
his
once
favourite
fortress
but
the
danger
for
the
moment
had
passed
away
and
though
the
thunder
growled
and
the
lightning
flashed
in
the
far
distance
there
appeared
no
immediate
risk
of
the
approach
of
the
tempest
the
campaign
had
been
an
arduous
one
for
poor
ameena
who
had
far
overrated
her
strength
indeed
the
rapid
marches
made
by
the
sultaun
whose
personal
activity
was
wonderful
had
sorely
tried
the
khan
himself
and
he
had
been
selected
for
the
duty
of
escorting
the
ladies
of
the
harem
from
bangalore
to
the
capital
he
had
therefore
had
no
part
in
the
late
movements
of
the
campaign
but
remained
at
his
post
without
the
city
accompanied
by
the
young
patél
who
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
bear
once
more
his
active
share
in
the
command
of
the
body
of
horse
to
which
he
had
been
appointed
but
as
soon
as
the
immediate
alarm
of
the
british
advance
and
siege
of
the
fort
was
over
they
returned
to
their
old
ways
of
life
the
khan
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
repose
of
his
zenana
and
to
the
society
of
ameena
whose
health
owing
to
fatigue
and
had
been
indifferent
and
kasim
to
his
daily
attendance
at
the
sultaun
s
durbar
where
he
soon
grew
to
be
familiar
with
the
strange
and
perplexing
character
he
served
so
long
as
the
hurry
and
bustle
of
the
arriving
and
departing
troops
the
preparations
for

and
the
constant
alarms
of
the
english
continued
the
minds
of
all
were
filled
with
speculations
as
to
the
issue
of
the
swayed
by
hope
some
by
fear
kummoo
was
like
the
rest
and
because
the
objects
of
her
hate
were
absent
she
was
powerless
but
when
once
more
all
was
fairly
tranquil
her
thoughts
returned
rapidly
into
their
old
channels
and
as
the
khan
never
now
visited
her
but
contented
with
ameena
merely
sent
cold
inquiries
as
to
the
state
of
her
health
she
detested
her
more
than
ever
and
perhaps
with
better
cause
than
at
first
since
the
effect
was
more
lasting
from
time
to
time
she
had
urged
her
mother
and
her
old
servant
to
aid
her
in
preparing
the
charms
and
spells
which
were
to
work
ameena
s
ruin
and
after
long
delays
caused
partly
by
the
timidity
of
the
old
woman
to
begin
her
deferred
selection
of
lucky
and
unlucky
days
and
often
by
her
scruples
of
she
believed
firmly
in
her
own
night
was
determined
on
when
they
were
to
attend
and
assist
in
the
ceremony
meanwhile
and
especially
as
the
day
drew
near
the
attention
of
the
two
wives
was
more
and
more
turned
upon
ameena
gradually
they
had
removed
from
her
the
thought
that
they
were
inimical
to
her
and
at
the
time
we
speak
of
she
could
not
have
supposed
that
they
whose
professions
of
friendship
and
acts
of
kindness
were
constant
harboured
any
thought
of
ill
towards
her
if
the
old
woman
herself
had
seen
the
innocent
and
beautiful
being
against
whom
she
was
plotting
it
is
probable
her
heart
would
have
relented
towards
one
whose
thoughts
were
purity
and
innocence
and
whose
only
sin
was
often
an
indulgence
in
thoughts
of
tender
than
befitted
her
she
had
loved
from
the
first
and
yet
there
was
every
excuse
for
her
the
khan
was
old
and
weak
in
many
points
and
though
a
brave
soldier
so
superstitious
that
the
merest
trifles
affected
him
powerfully
and
much
of
his
time
was
spent
in
averting
by
ceremonies
for
which
he
had
to
pay
heavily
glances
of
the
evil
eye
which
he
fancied
had
been
cast
on
him
when
any
pain
or
ache
affected
a
frame
already
shaken
by
the
wars
of
years
ameena
could
not
love
him
though
he
was
kind
and
indulgent
to
her
she
honoured
tended
respected
him
as
a
child
would
do
a
father
but
love
such
as
the
young
feel
for
each
other
in
that
clime
she
felt
not
for
him
and
she
had
much
ado
to
repress
the
feelings
which
her
own
heart
aided
by
her
fond
old
nurse
meeran
constantly
prompted
for
kasim
poor
ameena
she
tried
to
be
happy
and
cheerful
but
she
was
like
a
fair
bird
in
a
gilded
cage
which
though
it
often
pours
forth
its
songs
in
seeming
joyousness
still
pines
for
liberty
and
the
free
company
of
its
mates
it
was
with
mingled
feelings
of
awe
and
superstitious
terror
that
the
khan
s
two
wives
betook
themselves
to
the
house
of
kummoo
s
mother
on
the
day
assigned
for
the
incantation
as
their
food
had
been
cooked
by
their
own
women
in
their
own
private
apartments
they
had
been
able
to
practise
the
requisite
abstinence
from
the
various
spices
condiments
and
particular
descriptions
of
food
which
had
been
interdicted
by
the
old
woman
they
had
bathed
as
often
as
had
been
directed
and
observed
all
the
injunctions
to
perfect
purity
of
body
that
had
been
laid
upon
them
the
night
was
dark
and
gloomy
and
was
well
suited
for
their
walk
to
and
from
the
house
unobserved
they
hardly
spoke
as
closely
veiled
and
under
the
guidance
of
sozun
they
entered
the
house
and
at
once
passed
on
to
the
inner
apartments
do
not
delay
said
kummoo
s
mother
i
am
unclean
ye
will
be
defiled
if
ye
stay
here
she
is
within
in
the
they
obeyed
her
and
entered
it
it
was
a
small
square
room
the
floor
was
of
beaten
clay
and
had
been
most
carefully
swept
the
walls
and
roof
were
quite
bare
and
there
was
nothing
whatever
in
the
apartment
the
old
woman
sat
at
the
head
of
a
square
figure
divided
into
many
compartments
traced
on
the
floor
in
which
were
written
many
arabic
characters
and
ciphers
the
figure
was
a
rude
imitation
of
a
man
in
square
lines
and
crosses
and
the
silence
the
dim
light
of
a
miserable
lamp
and
the
crouching
figure
of
the
old
crone
who
was
mumbling
some
words
as
her
beads
passed
rapidly
through
her
fingers
inspired
them
with
dread
soh
ye
are
come
at
last

she
said
in
answer
to
their
benediction

ye
pure

and

i
conjure
ye
to
say
the
truth
if
ye
are
not

for
the
evil
of
this
will
fall
upon

pure

have
eaten

what
thou
hast
directed
and

it
was

of
you
must
behead
it
and
scatter

blood
over
the

and
trembled

on
ye
cowards
cried
the
crone

without
this
the
charm

if

hesitated
but
kummoo
was
daring
she
at
last
seized
the
knife
and
the
fowl
and
in
very
desperation
at
one
stroke
severed
the
head
from
the
body
hold
it
fast
hold
it
fast
cried
the
crone
for
its
convulsive
motions

hardly
be

sign
so
now
hold
it
there

blood

and
she
continued
her
incantation
in
a
low
tone
while
her
hearers
were
paralysed
with
fear
at
length
she
broke
out
aloud
and
desired
them
to
repeat
the
words
ai
boodboo
ai
shekh
suddoo
ai

ai

by

of
your

pierce
this
lime
with
five
needles
so
may
your
sharp
stings
pierce
her
heart
as
they

by
the
acid
so
may
her
liver
consume

ameen

ameen
and
as
she
pronounced
each
ameen
she
stuck
a
needle
through
the
green
lime
she
held
in
her
hand
enough
she
cried
it
is
done
leave
this
at
her
door
or
at
her
bedside
that
she
may
see
it
when
she
rises
in
the
morning
you
will
soon
hear
of
her
inshalla
they
were
glad
to
escape
from
the
place
for
guilt
was
in
their
hearts
and
terror
of
the
demons
whom
they
believed
to
have
been
present
they
did
not
even
stay
with
the
old
lady
but
hurried
home
as
fast
as
was
possible
in
the
darkness
when
all
were
asleep
kummoo
stole
softly
into
the
outer
apartment
of
that
where
ameena
was
and
deposited
the
charmed
lime
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
surrounding
it
with
a
circle
of
red
powder
as
she
had
been
directed
the
door
opened
inwards
so
there
was
no
fear
that
it
would
be
displaced
chapter
xlii
we
fear
we
can
hardly
convey
to
our
readers
any
adequate
sense
of
the
terror
with
which
as
she
arose
in
the
morning
and
opening
the
door
essayed
to
go
forth
to
her
ablutions
for
morning
prayer
ameena
regarded
the
fatal
sign
which
lay
before
her
a
faint
cry
which
she
had
uttered
roused
the
khan
who
darting
to
her
side
beheld
with
equal
or
indeed
greater
dismay
than
hers
the
dreadful
sight
a
matter
so
trifling
and
absurd
would
even
to
the
most
uneducated
person
in
this
enlightened
land
only
furnish
matter
for
ridicule
but
to
ameena
and
her
husband
who
with
their
countrymen
generally
were
deeply
imbued
with
the
belief
of
jins
fairies
spirits
of
the
air
and
other
supernatural
agents
and
devils
supposed
to
be
at
the
command
of
any
who
choose
by
study
or
penance
to
qualify
themselves
for
the
exercise
of
power
over
them
the
sight
was
one
of
horror
the
thought
that
their
deaths
were
desired
the
death
of
both
or
certainly
of
one
first
struck
upon
their
hearts
a
dull
but
a
deadly
blow
it
was
to
ameena
to
whom
the
first
sight
of
the
awful
spectacle
gave
a
terrible
earnest
that
she
was
the
person
for
whom
it
was
intended
the
khan
could
give
her
no
comfort
she
had
no
friend
but
her
old
nurse
meeran
who
even
more
superstitious
than
ameena
and
herself
mistress
as
she
thought
of
many
potent
charms
well
knew
the
power
which
had
directed
such
an
one
as
that
before
them
i
would
not
assert
that
men
of
station
respectability
and
education
in
india
among
the
mahomedans
are
not
many
of
them
free
from
the
debasing
belief
in
charms
and
witchcraft
even
though
their
existence
is
allowed
by
the
koran
but
no
one
will
be
hardy
enough
to
deny
that
by
far
the
greater
part
dare
not
disbelieve
it
that
many
practise
it
in
secret
if
not
themselves
at
least
by
aid
of
fakeers
and
old
women
and
that
in
their
harems
among
their
ladies
to
doubt
the
existence
of
it
would
be
as
sinful
as
to
doubt
that
of
the
prophet
himself
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
khan
was
a
man
born
in
the
lower
grade
of
society
that
he
had
been
a
reckless
soldier
of
fortune
was
ignorant
and
though
he
had
risen
to
high
rank
and
wealth
was
far
from
having
shaken
off
the
superstitions
with
which
he
had
begun
life
all
that
day
dismay
was
in
the
household
all
seemed
equally
struck
with
consternation
and
the
authors
of
the
evil
gave
to
ameena
their
most
hearty
sympathy
while
they
exulted
over
the
deed
and
saw
that
the
arrow
drove
home
to
her
very
heart
in
the
general
consultation
which
ensued
they
gave
it
as
their
opinion
that
it
could
have
been
intended
for
no
other
than
ameena
and
that
her
evil
destiny
had
led
her
to
look
upon
it
kasim
ali
was
sent
for
by
the
khan
and
with
better
sense
than
the
rest
tried
to
argue
him
out
of
a
belief
that
there
was
any
danger
to
assure
him
that
no
one
could
have
to
one
so
pure
so
innocent
and
so
unknown
as
his
wife
but
his
heart
misgave
him
as
to
the
author
of
the
evil
he
dared
not
however
mention
this
and
there
was
no
cause
for
suspicion
except
in
his
own
thoughts
devoted
to
the
khan
and
more
than
ever
anxious
for
ameena
of
whose
declining
health
under
the
horrible
ideas
that
she
was
possessed
by
devils
which
preyed
on
her
he
constantly
heard
through
the
faithful
zoolfoo
from
meeran
kasim
ali
spared
no
pains
to
give
such
ease
as
he
could
impart
by
the
performance
and
directions
of
those
ceremonies
which
were
prescribed
to
be
used
in
such
cases
the
most
holy
fakeers
were
consulted
they
made
expeditions
and
offered
fateehas
at
all
the
saints
and
martyrs
tombs
within
reach
in
her
name
puleetas
or
were
burned
in
her
name
and
she
was
fumigated
with
the
smoke
charmed
words
were
written
by
holy
fakeers
and
moolas
which
she
sometimes
ate
among
her
food
at
others
they
were
washed
off
the
paper
into
water
which
she
drank
footnote
offerings
for
the
remission
of
sins
and
favour
of
heaven
many
of
these
ceremonies
were
so
curious
that
we
are
almost
tempted
to
describe
them
minutely
but
as
they
would
occupy
much
space
and
alas
we
are
restricted
to
pages
and
lines
we
are
compelled
to
abandon
them
to
imagination
in
truth
they
are
so
ridiculous
and
puerile
that
perhaps
they
might
only
provoke
risibility
especially
in
our
fair
readers
if
we
should
relate
them
very
gravely
and
almost
insist
on
their
belief
in
their
efficacy
but
all
these
efforts
brought
no
relief
to
poor
ameena
sometimes
she
would
rally
awhile
and
might
be
seen
tending
her
few
flowers
feeding
her
birds
or
her
pigeons
and
though
with
wasted
and
pallid
features
and
a
hollow
short
cough
from
which
she
could
obtain
no
respite
she
tried
to
throw
off
the
dreadful
weight
at
her
heart
and
would
sometimes
partially
succeed
it
would
again
return
with
redoubled
force
and
prostrating
her
strength
reduce
her
by
the
slow
fever
which
came
with
it
to
a
state
of
weakness
which
prevented
all
motion
the
poor
girl
would
lie
for
hours
in
her
open
verandah
gazing
up
into
the
depths
of
the
clear
sky
above
her
in
no
pain
but
with
an
intense
yearning
to
be
at
rest
for
ever
to
join
the
society
of
the
angels
and
peris
whom
she
fancied
hovered
there
ready
to
receive
her
how
often
she
pined
for
lie
on
her
honoured
mother
s
breast
and
breathe
away
her
life
in
happy
repose
and
often
she
implored
the
khan
to
send
her
thither
it
is
impossible
he
said
to
travel
the
english
hold
the
frontiers
the
fierce
marauding
mahrattas
and
the
nizam
s
forces
occupy
the
roads
and
it
would
be
madness
to
attempt
so
hazardous
an
no
she
was
to
hope
such
illnesses
were
long
but
inshalla
there
was
hope
inshalla
the
charms
the
spells
the
exorcisms
would
take
effect
and
she
would
rise
again
to
be
his
own
ameena
but
alas
we
grieve
to
write
it
that
in
one
who
possessed
so
many
noble
qualities
courage
frankness
honesty
sincerity
there
should
be
one
terrible
vice
though
not
openly
discernible
lurked
at
his
heart
and
ere
long
broke
forth
to
the
peril
of
poor
ameena
her
wasted
cheek
the
hollow
dull
eye
though
sometimes
the
large
and
expressive
orbs
flashed
with
a
light
almost
painful
to
look
on
and
which
to
those
around
her
was
an
earnest
that
the
malignant
spirits
lurked
still
within
her
caused
gradually
in
the
khan
an
absence
of
affection
of
of
that
love
which
he
had
once
delighted
to
show
he
was
a
sensualist
and
in
ameena
s
faded
like
a
withered
flower
there
were
only
the
lineaments
traceable
of
what
existed
in
the
full
vigour
of
health
and
in
her
wasted
and
enfeebled
form
there
was
no
enjoyment
no
attraction
his
change
to
her
was
gradual
very
gradual
but
it
was
perceptible
it
would
have
been
merciful
perhaps
had
it
come
at
once
it
would
have
prevented
days
and
nights
of
wretchedness
which
had
no
power
of
alleviation
and
with
the
horrible
thoughts
and
ideas
which
haunted
her
the
miserable
one
of
being
gradually
deserted
came
upon
her
slowly
but
too
surely
while
she
lay
burned
by
consuming
fever
pallid
exhausted
reduced
almost
to
a
skeleton
with
parched
lips
and
mouth
there
moved
around
her
bedside
ministering
to
her
trifling
wants
with
a
mock
gratification
and
assiduity
the
work
of
a
fiend
glutting
over
the
ruin
she
had
caused
the
noble
form
of
kummoo
her
features
full
of
beauty
her
eyes
flashing
with
love
her
every
motion
one
of
grace
and
dignity
she
always
dressed
with
the
most
scrupulous
care
generally
in
the
purest
white
muslin
which
transparent
as
it
was
when
she
wound
it
about
the
upper
part
of
her
perfect
form
disclosed
enough
to
attract
notice
if
not
desire
she
would
study
the
times
when
the
khan
was
likely
to
arrive
in
his
zenana
and
always
contriving
to
be
there
before
him
would
rise
to
depart
when
he
entered
for
a
long
time
he
permitted
this
only
returning
the
distant
salutation
she
gave
him
but
gradually
he
spoke
to
her
asked
after
her
health
then
bade
her
remain
and
so
it
continued
from
time
to
time
until
they
conversed
gaily
together
and
at
first
poor
ameena
was
glad
that
they
were
friends
and
that
there
was
a
chance
that
the
harmony
of
intercourse
might
be
restored
which
once
must
have
existed
between
them
but
she
never
heard
that
he
visited
kummoo
in
her
own
apartments
or
that
they
met
elsewhere
than
before
her
she
could
not
have
objected
had
he
done
so
for
kummoo
was
his
wife
as
well
as
she
but
she
often
sighed
for
the
past
and
that
her
lot
had
not
been
cast
with
one
who
with
her
and
her
alone
would
have
gone
through
the
pilgrimage
allotted
them
upon
earth
and
in
whose
love
she
could
have
been
blest
her
trial
came
at
last
she
heard
from
meeran
who
had
long
discerned
the
approaching
intimacy
and
detected
its
gradual
development
than
the
khan
had
visited
kummoo
in
her
apartments
that
he
had
dined
with
her
and
spent
the
evening
in
her
company
she
was
glad
at
first
a
feeling
she
had
been
trying
to
reason
herself
into
by
degrees
but
meeran
in
her
zeal
and
love
was
indignant
and
sought
but
happily
with
no
effect
to
inflame
her
mistress
s
jealousy
poor
ameena
jealousy
she
never
pang
was
in
mercy
spared
her
she
smiled
at
her
nurse
s
fears
told
her
that
she
looked
to
greater
happiness
from
sweeter
intercourse
with
her
and
to
a
friendship
which
the
khan
would
share
with
both
alas
these
were
dreams
which
cheated
her
pure
and
sunny
mind
where
no
evil
thought
ever
was
full
of
love
and
innocence
but
when
neglect
a
day
passed
and
the
khan
did
not
visit
she
heard
that
he
was
constantly
in
kummoo
s
messages
came
from
the
lady
to
inquire
after
her
health
and
stated
that
because
the
khan
was
with
her
she
could
not
attend
her
when
day
after
day
elapsed
and
she
saw
him
when
he
came
his
stay
was
short
his
questions
hurried
and
abrupt
and
though
in
her
meek
and
gentle
nature
she
never
complained
yet
his
demeanour
would
show
that
he
was
conscious
of
having
wronged
her
and
he
would
be
formal
and
she
fancied
even
the
arrow
which
had
been
shot
to
her
very
heart
of
hearts
rankled
deeply
and
in
the
utter
prostration
of
her
intellect
before
the
misery
she
suffered
she
prayed
earnestly
for
death
in
the
hope
that
ere
many
weeks
or
days
she
would
be
numbered
with
the
dead
and
her
place
among
the
children
of
earth
become
vacant
for
ever
how
kummoo
exulted
in
the
success
of
her
scheme
she
heaped
presents
upon
the
old
woman
by
whose
aid
she
had
effected
it
she
gave
her
jewels
from
her
own
stores
clothes
of
costly
price
which
the
hag
treasured
up
though
the
grave
was
yawning
to
receive
her
and
which
she
vowed
to
expend
in
distributions
to
fakeers
and
holy
saints
for
the
repose
of
kummoo
s
soul
and
her
acceptation
with
alla
day
after
day
brought
confirmations
of
the
evil
work
the
bolt
had
barb
rankled
and
could
not
be
withdrawn
ameena
was
wasted
burned
with
fever
ha
ha
cried
the
hag
did
i
not
say
when
your
hand
trembled
at
the
sacrifice
it
was
well
ye
did
it
and
the
blood
poured
forth
freely
that
it
was
they
drank
it
ha
ye
slaves
to
my
will
iblees
and
his
legions
ye
musoo
and
shekh
suddoo
and
ye
legions
of
chooraeel
and
ye
nine
sons
of
satan
i
thank
ye
all

within
her
ye
are
not
to
come
forth
till
the
exorcism
of
a
more
powerful
than
i
am
is
where
will
they
find
that
one
my
pearl
and
my
ruby
and
then
by
her
counsel
kummoo
had
put
herself
in
the
way
of
the
khan
and
as
she
bade
her
to
wait
patiently
the
working
of
the
spell
so
did
she
not
taking
offence
at
fancied
slights
but
adorning
herself
with
jewels
and
disclosing
her
beauteous
face
to
him
from
time
to
time
and
when
there
was
appearance
that
he
relented
the
old
woman
bade
her
prepare
a
feast
for
him
and
gave
her
a
powder
to
mingle
with
his
charm
which
should
turn
his
heart
were
it
of
stone
and
cause
it
to
become
as
wax
in
the
hand
of
the
moulder
a
spell
she
had
prepared
in
secret
the
ingredients
of
which
were
only
known
to
those
students
of
her
mystic
art
who
had
devoted
years
to
its
accomplishment
she
was
successful
all
went
right
the
khan
partook
of
her
food
she
sang
and
played
to
him
and
displayed
the
witchery
of
her
charms
he
had
never
thought
her
so
lovely
she
was
his
wife
his
own
kummoo
once
more
such
as
she
had
been
when
he
took
her
from
her
home
to
his
and
a
bright
field
of
enjoyment
was
spread
out
before
them
wherein
were
flowers
blooming
and
no
shadow
to
dim
their
brilliancy
then
came
new
clothes
and
jewels
and
money
and
rich
gifts
and
the
old
woman
partook
of
all
and
laughed
in
her
heart
that
she
and
she
alone
knew
the
depths
of
the
human
mind
whose
own
passions
and
not
her
demons
were
working
the
issue
which
she
contemplated
when
is
it
however
that
guilt
is
satisfied
by
one
step
to
gain
an
end
desired
the
very
progress
the
watching
the
slow
process
of
the
machinery
of
the
plot
only
causes
insatiate
desires
to
accelerate
its
motion
endless
yearnings
after
the
end
fears
and
doubts
of
success
alternate
with
guilty
terrors
which
turn
back
again
and
meet
the
desires
for
completion
now
that
kummoo
had
gained
her
purpose
that
the
khan
was
her
daily
companion
that
ameena
sick
to
death
neglected
and
thrown
aside
mourned
over
her
lost
happiness
and
was
regarded
as
one
in
whom
even
devils
abode
one
whose
fate
it
was
to
linger
for
a
while
and
then
to
pass
away
from
the
memories
of
men
even
now
kummoo
longed
for
her
death
and
looked
to
it
impatiently
once
the
devil
within
her
had
suggested
poison
but
she
put
that
back
with
a
strenuous
effort
it
can
not
last
long
she
thought
but
it
did
for
ameena
lingered
the
thought
constantly
arose
that
ameena
would
recover
that
again
she
would
see
her
in
her
hated
beauty
the
power
she
had
gained
over
the
khan
would
then
melt
away
and
her
former
state
of
degradation
would
be
renewed
she
held
long
conversations
with
sozun
who
bad
as
she
was
dared
not
even
follow
her
mistress
s
thoughts
of
crime
hoormut
had
gained
nothing
by
the
spell
for
she
was
still
neglected
and
the
wretched
state
of
ameena
stung
her
conscience
bitterly
often
she
longed
to
disclose
all
but
the
dread
of
the
shame
and
punishment
which
would
have
followed
and
the
vengeance
of
the
reckless
woman
who
had
led
her
on
deterred
her
it
was
enough
for
her
that
the
mischief
which
was
fast
progressing
had
been
done
she
would
aid
its
fulfilment
no
further
kasim
ali
had
been
unavoidably
absent
for
some
time
the
sultaun
s
possessions
in
the
barah
mahal
had
gradually
fallen
before
the
forces
of
the
english
under
maxwell
and
floyd
and
one
by
one
the
strongholds
had
been
reduced
kistna
gherry
still
held
out
and
had
earnestly
applied
for
succours
of
money
and
men
the
young
and
daring
kasim
was
the
man
on
whom
the
sultaun
s
eye
rested
for
the
performance
of
this
it
was
conduct
a
large
force
through
the
ground
occupied
by
a
powerful
enemy
kasim
burned
for
distinction
and
he
fulfilled
his
trust
manfully
for
though
pursued
hard
both
by
maxwell
and
floyd
at
the
head
of
the
english
cavalry
he
eluded
them
and
having
attained
his
object
returned
into
mysore
with
but
little
loss
it
was
during
his
absence
that
the
khan
s
change
towards
ameena
had
become
visible
and
on
his
return
in
reply
to
his
anxious
queries
as
to
whether
she
lived
he
was
told
of
her
still
precarious
state
and
her
fresh
cause
for
misery
alas
kasim
ali
could
not
aid
her
except
by
constant
messages
of
kindness
through
zoolficar
and
proffers
of
service
even
to
death
should
she
require
or
command
them
how
often
did
he
long
to
remonstrate
with
the
khan
upon
his
behaviour
to
implore
him
to
allow
her
to
depart
to
her
own
home
but
he
dared
not
that
would
have
been
impossible
months

and
invigorated
by
the

climate
and

of

by

in
a
far
different
condition
to
that
in
which
they
had
before
essayed

capture
and
fought
a
battle
within

of
their

they
proceeded

the
sultaun
exulted
that
the
english
went
for
he
knew
its
impregnable
strength
and
the
deadly
jungles
by
which
it
was
surrounded
too
fell
by
a
de
he
could
not
credit
it
he
raved
like
a
wild
beast
when
the
news
was
brought
but
that
did
not
alter
the
loss
and
it
was
followed
by
other
reverses
day
after
day
it
was
true
that
the
success
of
his
son
futteh
hyder
against
gurrumcoondah
which
had
been
taken
by
the
nizam
s
troops
and
which
contained
the
family
of
his
relation
meer
sahib
revived
him
for
a
while
but
the
resolute
and
rapid
approach
of
the
english
army
upon
his
capital
was
not
to
be
disguised
and
their
unvaried
success
smote
hard
at
his
heart
and
daunted
his
army
but
there
were
other
causes
for
dismay
on
both
sides
men
had
begun
to
ask
among
themselves
soon
after
the
battle
of
arikhéra
as
day
after
day
they
attended
the
durbar
and
the
band
of
beautiful
english
boys
upon
whose
dancing
their
eyes
had
rested
in
admiration
and
to
whose
delicious
voices
they
had
used
to
listen
did
not
had
become
of
them
the
many
others
too
who
had
long
languished
in
confinement
and
whom
they
had
used
to
mock
and
were
they
and
then
speculation
and
conjecture
arose
and
would
not
be
still
for
there
went
suspicion
abroad
that
they
had
been
destroyed
and
it
was
right
despite
of
the
sultaun
s
care
there
were
those
who
told
openly
in
their
drunkenness
that
they
had
strangled
them
and
that
jaffar
sahib
jemadar
had
looked
on
and
while
he
mocked
their
cries
had
encouraged
their
destroyers
many
others
too
had
been
secretly
murdered
in
the
lonely
where
they
were
confined
and
even
in
the
secret
prisons
and
apartments
of
the
palace
men
openly
talked
of
the
butchery
and
though
they
hated
the
english
yet
they
were
men
and
soldiers
and
abhorred
the
secret
murders
and
the
concealment
and
all
pitied
and
mourned
over
the
fate
of
the
poor
boys
dreading
the
vengeance
of
the
english
when
the
reckoning
should
come
and
there
should
be
few
to
meet
it
discontent
openly
showed
itself
everywhere
there
was
a
feverish
excitement
among
the
troops
a
restless
desire
that
the
english
should
arrive
and
their
suspense
be
dispelled
either
by
victory
or
defeat
the
day
of
january
was
one
long
remembered
by
those
who
witnessed
it
the
english
army
led
by
its
noble
commander
now
more
like
a
triumphal
procession
than
a
slow
invasion
had
arrived
on
the
distant
heights
and
were
rapidly
pouring
from
them
upon
the
plain
which
led
to
the
city
and
the
sultaun
dreading
an
immediate
attack
had
ordered
out
the
whole
of
his
force
which
in
glittering
array
lined
the
the
esplanade
before
it
the
banks
of
the
river
and
the
redoubts
and
batteries
beyond
it
was
a
gorgeous
spectacle
that
english
host
in
long
narrow
and
compact
columns
their
bayonets
glancing
in
the
sun
as
they
moved
with
measured
tread
to
the
sound
of
their
martial
music
everywhere
around
in
wild
disorder
were
crowds
of
the
nizam
s
and
the
mahratta
horse
accompanied
by
numbers
of
elephants
many
of
the
men
in
bright
armour
with
gay
scarfs
wound
round
their
steel
caps
others
in
or
satin
tunics
many
in
gorgeous
cloth
of
gold
or
silver
their
horses
trappings
of
velvet
or
fine
cloth
most
in
white
with
gay
scarfs
and
whole
everywhere
restless
careering
about
firing
matchlocks
as
they
advanced
now
dashing
out
to
the
front
and
brandishing
their
spears
without
any
order
discipline
or
command
and
crying
shouts
of
abuse
or
the
various
war
cries
of
their
respective
faiths
under
the
walls
was
the
sultaun
s
vast
concourse
arrayed
in
their
regiments
and
in
fair
order
at
their
various
posts
everywhere
among
them
moved
richly
caparisoned
elephants
and
horses
whose
riders
were
as
gaily
dressed
as
those
of
the
advancing
army
the
walls
of

fort
the
minarets
of
the
mosque
the
terraced
houses
the
trees
every
rising
ground
were
covered
with
the
inhabitants
of
the

the

looking
at
the
advancing
stream
of
their
enemies
which
appeared
to
flow
on
without
resistance
above
all
glowed
a
sun
dazzlingly
bright
but
now
declining
fast
whose
slanting
beams
lighted
up
the
scene
catching
the
various
objects
and
causing
them
to
glitter
even
more
than
if
they
had
come
from
above

covered
with
burning

in
motion
the
other

to

the

the

glowed
with
a
brilliance

effect

the
circumstances
of
the
thousands
present
were
not
likely
to
efface
from
their
remembrance
chapter
xliii
after
witnessing
the
gradual
wasting
and
feverish
excitement
of
her
young
mistress
for
some
weeks
the
faithful
meeran
could
no
longer
bear
to
see
her
wretched
condition
she
knew
how
devotedly
kasim
ali
loved
her
and
she
determined
as
her
last
resource
to
make
an
appeal
to
his
generosity
if
not
to
his
love
to
implore
him
to
rescue
her
from
the
condition
she
was
in
and
to
assist
her
to
escape
or
at
once
take
her
under
his
roof
it
was
late
in
the
evening
before
that
on
which
the
english
arrived
before
the
fort
that
she
betook
herself
to
kasim
s
abode
she
had
openly
declared
her
intention
to
ameena
indeed
she
had
spoken
to
her
of
it
for
days
before
and
endeavoured
gradually
to
prepare
her
to
abandon
the
khan
and
fly
to
her
though
it
to
seek
at
once
the
protection
of
the
patél
his
mother
too
whose
village
though
many
days
journey
distant
she
thought
it
possible
she
might
be
able
to
reach
and
she
felt
assured
would
receive
her
after
resting
there
for
a
while
she
could
pursue
her
journey
to
hyderabad
and
ameena
timidly
distrustfully
and
yet
anxiously
had
at
last
given
permission
to
her
to
go
and
ascertain
if
it
were
possible
meeran
had
placed
zoolficar
upon
the
watch
to
note
the
return
of
the
young
patél
from
his
tour
of
duty
to
rest
for
the
night
and
when
she
was
apprised
of
that
she
bade
her
young
mistress
farewell
for
the
while
and
telling
her
to
be
of
good
cheer
that
she
would
soon
return
with
joyful
news
she
departed
zoolfoo
awaited
her
without
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
arrived
at
the
patél
s
abode
anxiously
they
looked
around
lest
any
one
should
observe
them
but
there
was
only
one
woman
at
some
distance
whom
they
hardly
heeded
they
opened
the
door
of
the
which
they
found
unfastened
and
leaving
it
in
the
same
state
for
they
knew
not
why
it
was
opened
they
passed
on
to
the
patél
he
was
wearied
with
his
day
s
attendance
on
the
sultaun
and
lay
reclining
on
his
carpet
reading
as
usual
which
was
a
solace
to
him
after
the
empty
compliment
the
lies
the
inflated
vanity
of
the
sultaun
s
words
and
more
frequently
of
late
his
querulous
remarks
and
violent
bursts
of
passion
they
hesitated
for
a
minute
but
he
had
heard
the
noise
in
the
verandah
and
supposing
it
to
be
his
servants
desired
them
to
enter

and

and
refreshed
her
but

sometimes
lovely
as
when

and
wasted
alas
that

should
be
her
destiny
alas
that

of

life
my
heart
s
blood
should
be
hers
if
i
knew
it

cried
the
nurse
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
as
she
had
listened
to
the
young
man
and
now
suddenly
interrupted
him
i
knew
it
thou
canst
aid
her
patél

save
her
o
jemadar
and
thou
wilt

and
she
cast
herself
at
his
feet
and
sobbed
aloud

meeran
this
is
unseemly
said
kasim
gently
again
i
swear
to
thee
if
i
can
aid
her
even
by

of
my
life

and
wiping

told
her

willing
that

whence
she
can
escape
to
thy
mother
s
and
wait
there
till
thou
canst
be
freed
from
hence
or
that
she
can
rest
there
till
she
has
strength
to
go
on
wilt
thou
not
aid
her
by
the
head
of
thy
mother
by
thy
hopes
of
paradise
i
conjure
thee
to
do
it
o
patél
but
the
khan
said
kasim
will
he
not
let
her
go
enemy
is
in
the
path
but
were
it
satan
i
would
face
him
for
the
khan
cried
the
nurse
thooh
i
spit
on
him
for
a
man
his
days
are
wasted
in
dalliance
with
her
who
as
sure
as
alla
rules
above
us
is
the
author
of
this
calamity
speak
to
him
no
by
the
prophet

asked
him
a
thousand
times
and
i
have
too
the
enemy

out
saith
he
the
english
kafirs
who
would
make
a
captive
of
her
it
would
be
madness
bah
they
do
not
war
against
women
as
he
does
no
there
is
no
hope
from
him
but
will
he
not
relent
towards
her
alla
is
my
witness
no
for
a
week
he
hath
not
seen
her
and
the
poor
soul
is
cut
to
the
heart
by
the
neglect
she
is
an
angel
or
a
peri
meer
sahib
or
she
could
not
bear
this
kasim
sighed
has
she
strength
he
said
after
a
while
ay
enough
for
that
her
body
is
weak
but
her
spirit
is
stout
if
once
she
was
bent
on
escape
it
would
turn
her
mind
from
the
thought
of
the
curse
and
she
would
recover
as
soon
as
she
had
escaped
from
these
accursed
alas
sighed
kasim
how
dare
i
leave
my
post
at
such
a
moment
when
the
english
are
upon
us

every
man

salt

nurse

my
mother

she
will
become
a
daughter
to
her
and
no
matter
let
that
be
as
it
is
written
in
our
destiny
go
now
ye
have
tarried
ere
they
arose
to
depart
a
female
figure
which
had
been
seated
at
the
door
drinking
in
every
word
of
their
discourse
with
greedy
ears
arose
rapidly
and
gliding
away
to
the
edge
of
the
verandah
stepped
from
it
into
the
and
squatted
behind
a
thick
bush
of
méhndee
which
grew
there
the
joyful
pair
passed
on
and
after
allowing
a
few
moments
to
elapse
she
arose
and
followed
them
that
woman
was
sozun
a
few
nights
after
in
a
small
chamber
in
the
house
of
kummoo
s
mother
adjoining
the
one
which
we
have
before
mentioned
sat
kummoo
and
the
wretched
old
woman
her
accomplice
they
spoke
in
low
tones
and
whispers
and
in
dread
for
the
cannon
of
the
english
roared
without
and
was
answered
in
loud
peals
from
the
walls
of
the
fort
the
siege
had
begun
now
two
days
the
issue
of
the
of
the
of
february
and
its
effect
upon
the
sultaun
s
army
causing
nearly
of
its
number
to
desert
and
fly
from
a
service
they
had
long
detested
is
well
known
on
the
following
morning
thousand
were
missing
and
among
them
hundreds
of
the
europeans
upon
whom
he
had
placed
such
reliance
they
preferred
surrendering
themselves
into
the
hands
of
a
generous
enemy
to
the
service
of
a
and
capricious
monster
the
rest
of
the
army
had
retired
within
the
walls
and
faithful
to
their
cause
had
determined
to
defend
them
to
the
last
there
was
an
awful
din
without
the
roar
of
cannon
the
incessant
rattle
of
musketry
the
hissing
sound
of
shells
as
they
descended
and
burst
came
full
on
the
ears
of
the
guilty
pair
and
the
old
woman
cowered
to
the
ground
in
fright
knoweth
of
this
why
is
she
not
here
she
asked
after
a
long
silence
she
knoweth
it
mother
said
kummoo
but
she
is
a
coward
a
pitiful
coward
and
dared
not
venture
forth
when
shot
is
flying
but
it
is
dost
thou
delay
thou
saidst
all
was
but
the
cannon
heart
is
ay
who
is
the
coward
now
once
thou
didst
call
a
coward
kureena
behold
i
am
now
ready
what
are
the
cannon
to
us
arise
and
come
i
say
i
see
thou
hast
prepared
the
time
passes
and
the
khan
expects
me
he
will
be
returned
ere
this
from
the
she
will
die
without
it
daughter
munoo
and
shekh
suddoo
came
to
me
in
my
dreams
last
night
said
the
hag
and
they
told
me
she
would
die
this
new
ceremony
is
i
will
not
believe
it
by
alla
thou
liest
nurse
she
was
better
and
hate
her
come
here
is
gold
for
lovest
and
she
disengaged
a
gold
ring
from
her
wrist
and
forced
it
upon
the
other
s
while
she
seized
her
arm
and
dragged
her
along
my
blessings
on
thee
blessings
of
the
old
woman
who
is
nigh
death
she
said
this
will
feed
a
hundred
fakeers
this
will
purchase
a
hundred
readings
of
the
koran
for
me
when
i
am
dead
my
blessings
on
thee
daughter
come
quickly
cried
kummoo
come
quickly
why
tarriest
materials
have
been
ready
these
many
days
enter
follow
she
did
so
and
closed
the
door
the
room
was
the
one
we
have
before
mentioned
a
magic
figure
of
a
different
form
to
the
first
was
drawn
on
the
clay
square
divided
into
compartments
with
figures
in
each
or
marks
intended
to
represent
them
the
old
hag
as
she
entered
made
three
low
obeisances
to
each
side
of
the
figure
and
placing
herself
at
the
head
began
a
low
monotonous
chant
which
was
intended
to
be
a
chapter
of
the
koran
read
backwards
rocking
the
while
to
and
fro
it
was
in
truth
mere
unintelligible
gibberish
after
awhile
she
untied
some
earth
and
ashes
from
the
corner
of
her
doputta
and
pouring
water
upon
them
gradually
increased
her
tone
kneading
the
mixture
into
a
stiff
clay
soon
she
changed
the
incantation
into
the
names
of
the
many
demons
she
had
invoked
before
and
her
tones
became
wilder
and
wilder
as
she
formed
the
clay
into
the
rude
image
of
a
human
being
this
done
she
rested
awhile
mumbling
to
herself
with
her
eyes
shut
and
at
length
taking
from
her
cloth
a
number
of
small
pegs
of
wood
she
drove
them
into
the
head
the
arms
the
body
the
legs
and
feet
of
the
image
accompanying
each
with
curses
at
which
even
kummoo
shuddered
hast
thou
the
shroud
daughter
she
said
as
she
finished
behold
the
image
is
ready
a
bonny
image
it
ashes
of
a
kafir
hindoo
burned
at
the
full
moon
the
earth
of
the
grave
of
a
woman
who
died
in
had
much
ado
to
find
together
hast
thou
the
shroud

is

a
pretty
corpse

embraces
of

days

young
corpse

thy
house
and

call
me

the
tis

old
woman

business
and
i
love
to
look
on
such
ha
ha
away
delay
it
at
her
door
its
head
to
the
east
that
she
may
see
it
in
the
morning
ere
the
sun
kummoo
s
brain
was
in
a
whirl
and
she
obeyed
almost
without
speaking
in
reply
she
hurried
home
through
the
thronged
streets
little
heeding
any
even
the
shot
which
whistled
she
reached
her
abode
undiscovered
for
many
nights
ameena
had
not
slept
so
soundly
or
so
refreshingly
as
on
that
when
the
plot
intended
to
cause
her
death
was
proceeding
to
its
completion
what
if
the
cannon
thundered
heard
it
not
she
was
secure
in
kasim
s
faith
a
day
the
next
was
to
leave
that
roof
she
hoped
for
ever
meeran
had
been
busily
occupied
in
removing
her
mistress
s
jewels
to
kasim
s
house
where
a
comfortable
dooly
was
already
prepared
for
her
and
two
stout
ponies
for
herself
and
her
brother
a
few
articles
of
clothing
too
and
some
of
the
rich
garments
which
the
khan
had
presented
to
ameena
in
the
days
of
their
pleasant
intercourse
there
were
many
that
she
abandoned
with
a
sigh
but
it
was
impossible
to
take
all
the
dreams
of
the
sleeper
were
fresh
and
balmy
visions
now
she
thought
she
wandered
through
groves
where
the
rich
scent
of
perfumed
the
air
and
the
song
of
birds
was
sweet
to
the
charmed
fountains
whose
murmuring
plash
mingled
with
the
sighs
of
the
soft
wind
among
the
trees
above
them
kasim
ali
was
beside
her
pouring
forth
a
tale
of
love
of
devotion
to
which
she
listened
with
delight
and
rapture
again
she
was
with
her
mother
her
dear
mother
and
as
she
lay
in
her
arms
and
wept
tears
of
joy
after
their
long
separation
which
were
kissed
from
her
cheeks
as
fast
as
they
trickled
over
felt
a
joy
a
sense
of
security
in
her
soul
which
was
delicious
beyond
expression
she
fancied
her
mother
spoke
to
her
and
she
awoke
alla
and
the
twelve
holy
imaums
keep
thee
this
day
my
rose
of
beauty
said
old
meeran
advancing
and
kissing
her
forehead
she
passed
her
hands
over
ameena
s
head
to
take
the
evil
from
it
my
blessing
and
the
blessing
of
holy
angels
and
saints
be
on
thee
how
brightly
thou
didst
smile
in
thy
sleep
alla
bless
thee
and
the
lady
muriam

mother
of
jesus

no
sadness
in
thy
face

nurse

i
had
such
happy
dreams
even
when
you
awoke
me
i
thought
but
no
and
she
hid
her
face
in
the
pillow
ay
thou
wert
smiling
in
thy
sleep
fairest
and
my
heart
was
glad
art
thou
strong
remember
it
is
we
ameena
blushed
deeply
i
remember
she
said
i
am
strong

will
meet
bless
thee
my
daughter
he
is
noble
and
worthy
of
thee
now
listen
and
lie
here
for
a
while
it
will
rest
thee
thou
shalt
rise
towards
afternoon
i
have
prepared
all
yonder
i
and
my
good
zoolfoo
ya
alla
kureem
ya
moula
ali
ya
boorhanee
sahib
grant
that
the
issue
of
this
be
favourable
now
turn
thee
fairest
and
sleep
again
may
sweet
visions
be
present
to
thee
for
there
is
no
longer
aught
to
meeran
left
her
she
had
arisen
early
and
as
she
approached
the
door
of
her
mistress
s
room
her
eye
caught
the
fatally
intended
image
which
had
been
laid
there
for
a
moment
she
was
staggered
and
her
heart
failed
her
as
she
remembered
its
fearful
import
but
instantly
she
rallied
i
bless
thee
o
gracious
alla
that
she
hath
not
seen
this
she
said
to
me
it
will
do
no
hurt
nor
to
her
for
i
will
remove
but
at
first
she
hesitated
to
touch
so
foul
a
thing
as
that
which
in
its
lay
before
her
bismilla
in
the
name
of
the
most
clement
and
merciful
she
cried
in
very
desperation
as
seizing
the
figure
at
last
and
hiding
it
under
her
doputta
she
hurried
forth
into
the
open
air
it
would
be
well
to
lay
it
at
her
own
door
she
thought
as
she
passed
near
that
of
but
no
better
to
destroy
she
passed
out
into
the
street
the
fresh
grey
dawn
was
breaking
and
only
an
occasional
firing
disturbed
the
silence
except
the
howling
of
the
dogs
which
was
dreadful
she
looked
for
a
dunghill
there
was
one
not
far
off
occupied
by
a
dozen
dogs
snarling
at
each
other
and
quarrelling
for
soft
places
among
the
ashes
with
a
volley
of
abuse
and
a
few
stones
they
fled
and
meeran
proceeded
to
do
her
errand
may
all
the
curses
which
were
said
over
this
image
she
cried
aloud
descend
upon
the
authors
of
it
may
they
dwell
in
their
bones
their
livers
their
blood
and
their
flesh
ameen
ameen
ameen
she
then
spat
on
the
face
of
the
image
and
throwing
it
on
the
ground
with
volleys
of
abuse
not
of
the
most
decent
character
she
trampled
it
to
atoms
under
her
feet
and
pounded
them
with
a
stone
till
not
a
fragment
remained
entire
then
taking
up
the
dust
she
threw
it
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
heavens
and
then
and
then
only
felt
satisfied
that
the
spell
was
broken
her
return
to
her
happy
smiling
mistress
was
the
dearest
proof
she
could
have
obtained
that
she
was
right
art
thou
sure
sozun
is
no
lie
of
thine
dost
not
dream
as
i
told
thee
jaffar
i
heard
it
with
my
own
ears
as
i
passed
along
they
entered
his
house
i
had
before
suspected
and
followed
them
for
i
knew
the
place
and
that
he
would
be
at
home
and
then
he
said
as
i
have
told
and
they
have
arranged
for

his

jaffar
the
virtuous
kasim
the
virtuous
syud
on
whom
the
dancers
cast
their
glances
in
vain
oh
rare
rare
and
he
laughed
heartily
and
with
a
triumphant
sound
what
fortune
he
continued
both
at
once
both
who
have
wronged
me
of
money
of
credit
of
rank
ya

mousoof

thus
saying
he
took
up
his
sword
and
passed
forth
on
his
errand
the
khan
was
at
his
post
in
a
cavalier
near
the
rampart
jaffar
ascended
it
the
men
were
working
two
heavy
guns
and
some
french
officers
directed
them
from
time
to
time
as
he
mounted
the
steps
a
shot
was
fired

the

he

jaffar
regarded

for
an
instant
and
chuckled

the
laugh
of
the
devil
within
him

question
he
said

the
khan
gasped
for
breath
and
tottered
to
the
wall
of
the
cavalier
which
prevented
his
falling
he
rallied
after
an
instant
and
with
his
sword
uplifted
rushed
upon
jaffar
strike
said
the
latter
as
he
drew
himself
up
proudly
if
thou
canst
strike
one
who
speaks
only
for
thy
good

my
alla
groaned
the
khan
dropping
the
point
of
his
sword

that

lied
and
i
will

shouted
the
khan
in
frenzy
let

have

been
no

patél
if
we
are
wrong
we
will
say

a
visit
dost
thou
agree
the
khan
was
stupefied
what
didst
thou
say
he
asked
i
did
not
hear
jaffar
repeated
his
question
i
will
come
thou
wilt
find
me

post
like
a
soldier
if
indeed
by
that
time
i
no
i
am
alive
i
will
accompany
farewell
then
alla
keep
thee
the
khan
remained
leaning
against
the
cavalier
the
shot
was
whistling
around
him
but
he
heard
it
not
there
was
no
sound
in
his
ears
but
one
the
low
but
distinct
ay
and
ameena
which
jaffar
had
uttered
he
would
have
given
worlds
could
they
have
been
recalled
chapter
xliv
come
my
child
my
sweet
one
my
rose
now
come
what
fear
is
there
thou
art
closely
veiled
all
are
in
consternation
and
men
and
women
run
hither
and
thither
abroad
making
vows
and
vain
prayers
that
this
firing
may
cease
come
no
one
sees
us
zoolfoo
waits
without
to
protect
thee
he
is
armed
in
case
of
insult
by
the
of
that
there
is
no
fear
come
he
expects
thee
even
now
his
heart
is
burning
for
thee
why
dost
thou
fear
thou
art
now
so
spoke
meeran
as
when
the
evening
fell
with
passionate
entreaty
she
implored
her
mistress
at
once
to
summon
courage
and
accompany
her
but
the
poor
girl
was
greatly
agitated
she
had
several
times
essayed
to
move
but
had
sunk
down
again
upon
the
low
bed
on
which
she
sat
closely
muffled
in
a
long
white
sheet
alla
help
me
i
can
not
is
impossible
to
him
i
shall
die
am
content
to
die
and
she
pressed
her
hand
on
her
heart
in
a
vain
attempt
to
still
its
throbbings
i
have
no
strength
to
walk
my
knees
tremble
my
heart
fails
me
there
is
no
and
she
burst
into
tears
they
will
do
her
good
thought
meeran
her
heart
is
too
awhile
she
waited
then
recollecting
that
there
was
cool
sherbet
without
she
ran
for
it
drink
she
said
drink
that
is
not
for
ameena
had
but
moistened
her
lips
with
could
not
swallow
drink
and
thou
wilt
be
better
drink
all
and
thy
heart
will
cool
so
now
shabash
art
thou
not
better
fairest
i
am
dear
nurse
said
more
composed
perhaps
than
before
but
it
is
can
not
go
hark
the
din
without
is
this
is
folly
my
where
is
thy
courage
art
thou
not
a
moghul
many
a
woman
among
them
has
wielded
weapons
ere
now
what
would
thy
father
say
if
he
saw
thee
on
this
coward
heart
of
thine
dost
thou
not
remember
when
the
mahrattas
were
upon
ye
thou
hast
often
told
me
thou
hadst
no
ameena
was
much
agitated
it
was
not
with
was
brave
and
it
was
shame
an
overwhelming
sense
of
modesty
which
she
imagined
she
was
about
to
outrage
what
if
he
loved
her
was
a
stranger
to
her
or
should
have
been
so
his
home
was
not
hers
her
fair
and
precious
fame
was
blasted
for
ever
should
she
be
seen
with
him
or
be
known
to
have
gone
to
his
abode
but
meeran
s
taunts
had
roused
her
a
little
for
with
all
her
meekness
and
gentleness
there
was
as
proud
a
spirit
within
her
as
ever
roused
to
she
arose
and
made
a
step
the
action
was
effort
of
her
mind
was
immense
shookr
khoda
said
meeran
seizing
her
arm
and
supporting
her
tottering
frame
come
quick
now
lean
on
me
holy
alla
how
thou
tremblest
remember
the
curse
from
this
spot
and
thou
art
free
think
of
that
in
thy
heart
and
be
firm
tis
the
moon
even
is
hath
veiled
her
light
for
an
instant
bismilla
thy
destiny
has
opened
brightly
dost
thou
fear
not
so
heart
is
stiller
but
o
nurse
what
will
he
say
he
will
adore
thee
he
will
love
thee
he
will
pity
thee
come
canst
thou
not
think
he
burns
to
meet
thee
his
spirit
is
with
thine
now
as
she
spoke
they
passed
out
through
one
little
court
after
another
which
belonged
to
the
zenana
they
went
on
to
a
small
door
which
led
into
the
street
meeran
coughed
signal
was
answered
they
opened
the
door
and
went
out
zoolfoo
was
there
armed
with
sword
and
buckler
only
that
he
was
rather
too
stout
he
would
have
looked
quite
martial
keep
close
behind
us
said
meeran
will
lead
when
we
have
entered
the
patél
s
door
go
thou
round
to
the
other
where
the
ponies
are
all
is
it
not
they
are
there
even
now
said
zoolfoo
and
the
patél
waits
bismilla
walk
pray
for
ye
as
i
they
hurried
on
the
open
fresh
cool
air
had
revived
ameena
and
though
she
still
trembled
exceedingly
and
her
heart
was
in
a
tumult
of
conflicting
feelings
she
suffered
herself
to
be
led
rather
than
walked
at
as
rapid
a
pace
as
meeran
thought
it
possible
for
one
so
weak
to
maintain
ameena
knew
the
house
was
near
but
moments
seemed
like
hours
as
they
proceeded
there
were
many
people
in
the
streets
hurrying
about
confusedly
and
many
forms
of
shrouded
women
like
her
own
some
alone
others
in
company
walking
very
horsemen
and
artillery
proceeding
to
their
destinations
on
and
near
the
walls
cries
oaths
the
rattle
and
creaking
of
the
and
above
all
the
roar
of
the
cannon
resounded
in
ameena
s
ears
and
the
din
and
confusion
almost
stunned
her
but
meeran
cheered
her
on
and
she
felt
stronger
as
she
proceeded
two
persons
were
watching
for
her
whom
she
little
thought
of
they
were
her
husband
and
jaffar
there
thou
see
khan
dost
thou
see
they
come
by
alla
the
latter
whispered
where
jaffar
where
i
see
them
no
i
was
cheated
they
turned
off
they
can
not
be
would
go
to
the
door
at
the
khan
breathed
again
he
was
standing
with
jaffar
at
the
corner
of
a
street
nearly
opposite
kasim
s
abode
they
were
in
the
deep
shadow
of
a
high
wall
and
could
not
well
be
observed
the
poor
khan
panted
and
gasped
for
breath
his
soul
was
on
fire
revenge
burned
there
and
suspicion
of
wrong
sometimes
during
the
day
he
thought
he
would
fly
to
ameena
and
implore
her
her
to
himself
at
her
feet
and
kiss
them
then
again
his
passion
arose
at
the
thought
that
she
should
have
been
false
to
have
used
so
long
a
deception
as
to
have
estranged
him
from
him
to
another
above
all
his
revenge
burned
against
kasim
ali
his
son
he
had
fondly
called
would
have
inherited
his
for
whom
he
had
been
ever
anxious
it
was
a
base
return
to
make
to
seduce
from
him
the
tender
being
whom
he
had
so
long
loved
but
his
thoughts
were
chaos
of
wild
passion
he
could
not
did
not
attempt
it
proof
of
their
guilt
was
all
he
looked
for
and
often
he
prayed
to
alla
that
it
might
not
come
there
was
one
spot
on
which
his
gaze
was
angle
of
the
street
which
led
into
that
where
was
kasim
s
abode
he
looked
neither
right
nor
left
nor
up
to
the
glorious
planet
that
sailed
on
in
her
sea
of
deep
azure
but
straight
on
sometimes
clearly
sometimes
dimly
and
then
he
would
fiercely
dash
away
the
tears
which
arose
unconsciously
to
his
eyes
look
look
khan
said
jaffar
in
a
hoarse
whisper
again
two
figures
and
now
a
man
see
he
s
tis
her
brother
and
one
leads
the
other
on
oh
the
vile
one
thus
to
pander
to
a
nose
should
be
cut
off
she
hesitates
by
alla
the
other
drags
her
cook
passes
i
cut
him
down
ameena
gasped
the
khan
in
a
low
husky
voice
stretching
his
arms
out
to
her
ameena
enter
not
home
on
tis
his
tis
the
patél
hast
no
business
there
thou
hears
alla
kureem
she
hath
gone
in
of
her
own
accord
and
he
had
only
spoken
in
a
hoarse
whisper
but
he
thought
he
had
shouted
those
broken
sentences
art
thou
satisfied
khan
am
i
thy
friend
now
said
jaffar
in
a
tone
of
triumph
wilt
thou
see
more
the
door
is
open
softly
thou
shalt
see
all
thou
knowest
the
place
they
will
be
in
the
inner
room
come
come
thou
mayest
yet
prevent
prevent
what
said
the
khan
abstractedly
he
was
bewildered
he
could
hardly
speak
his
mouth
was
so
parched
come
and
see
come
we
may
be
and
jaffar
seized
his
arm
and
dragged
him
across
the
road
the
door
was
ajar
they
entered
how
slowly
had
sped
the
dull
hours
to
kasim
ali
that
evening
he
had
prepared
all
for
the
reception
of
ameena
and
had
secured
one
of
the
posterns
which
led
towards
the
river
by
some
of
the
men
of
his
own
risala
who
he
knew
were
faithful
they
awaited
his
coming
there
was
personal
danger
but
it
was
nothing
in
comparison
with
her
safety
there
was
no
firing
on
that
side
for
there
was
no
attack
but
few
men
were
there
and
he
would
not
be
noticed
in
the
confusion
his
heart
yearned
to
the
poor
invalid
ameena
his
from
the
khan
by
unkindness
he
dared
not
think
of
what
bliss
might
be
hidden
from
them
behind
the
veil
of
the
future
but
which
could
not
follow
now
yet
he
should
see
her
should
welcome
to
her
oh
it
was
more
than
he
had
ever
dared
to
hope
he
was
restless
and
impatient
now
he
paced
his
small
chamber
a
hundred
times
the
dooly
which
was
there
arranged
the
pillows
and
smoothed
the
soft
bedding
again
he
tried
to
his
ear
was
alive
to
every
sound
at
last
the
door
of
the
court
opened
gently
he
hardly
breathed
something
white
it
was
closed
carefully
both
advanced
towards
him
he
dared
not
show
himself
lest
they
should
retreat
the
figures
swam
before
his
eyes
one
lingered
but
the
other
urged
her
on
and
spoke
cheerily
still
nearer
they
foot
of
one
was
on
the
step
she
appeared
to
woman
behind
caught
her
and
called
his
name
he
darted
to
her
and
raising
the
slight
form
she
supported
in
his
nervous
grasp
bore
it
into
the
inner
apartment
and
laid
it
upon
his
own
soft
cushions
ameena
ameena
speak
to
me
he
murmured
in
her
ear
mine
own
now
and
for
ever
ameena
look
on
me
holy
alla
how
thou
art
changed
her
veil
had
fallen
from
her
face
and
her
pallid
features
and
hollow
eyes
met
his
view
they
were
shut
and
she
dared
not
open
them
but
his

the
khan
panted
hard
and
quick
that
his
breath
hardly
came
at
times
it
was
marvellous
they
heard
him
not
his
hand
grasped
his
sword
he
looked
through
a
chink
in
the
door
with
eyes
that
glared
like
a
tiger
s
and
were
starting
from
their
sockets

granted
the
gentle
being
as
he
supported
her
to
the
conveyance
with
his
arm
around
her
turned
on
him
a
look
so
full
of
love
from
those
glorious
eyes
glistening
in
lustrous
look
of
joy
of
love
of
gratitude
of
passion
a
delicious
thrill
shot
through
his
frame
he
clasped
her
to
his
heart
his
lips
were
fastened
to
hers
in
a
kiss
which
for
the
time
gave
them
but
one
breath
one
being
their
souls
mingled
together
in
that
sweet
communion
dost
thou
hear
him
khan
whispered
jaffar
ya
alla
that
look
of
love
and
the
demon
had
done
his
work
in
a
frenzy
like
a
maddened
beast
the
khan
dashed
through
the
door
which
opened
inwards
his
sword
was
naked
and
flashed
as
it
was
high
upraised
in
his
nervous
and
passionate
grasp
a
wild
shriek
burst
from
meeran
and
she
fled
devils
he
shouted
in
a
voice
of
fury
devils
dog
of
a
patél
rhyman
khan
hath
seen
ye
the
sword
was
quivering
above
his
head
and
it
descended
blindly
to
annihilate
he
thought
both
at
a
blow
kasim
ali
stretched
forth
his
arm
to
stay
it
he
was
too
late
the
blood
of
ameena
who
was
senseless
gushed
forth
over
him
and
her
head
fell
back
upon
his
bosom
kasim
tried
to
get
at
his
sword
while
he
held
the
lifeless
form
on
his
arm
he
tore
it
desperately
down
from
the
nail
on
which
it
hung
above
him
expecting
another
blow
momentarily
it
came
not
his
sword
was
tied
to
the
scabbard
and
the
knot
of
the
cord
would
not
open
all
was
the
work
of
an
instant
he
turned
ready
to
ward
off
another
blow
and
beheld
a
sight
in
which
horror
and
pity
struggled
with
revenge
for
mastery
the
khan
s
sword
was
on
the
ground
his
hands
were
clasped
his
eyes
staring
and
fixed
upon
ameena
the
sight
of
blood
had
calmed
his
fury
miserable
man
what
hast
thou
done
said
kasim
hurriedly
the
khan
could
not
reply
he
rolled
his
eyes
upon
kasim
and
waving
his
hand
turned
and
fled
ha
ha
ha
laughed
a
voice
he
knew
to
be
jaffar
s
he
laid
ameena
down
and
looked
at
her
with
dim
seemed
dead
i
will
revenge
thee
he
cried
and
darted
after
them
he
saw
them
pass
the
small
door
close
it
violently
and
when
he
had
opened
it
and
dashed
on
into
the
open
street
he
saw
them
not
but
taking
the
way
opposite
to
theirs
he
fled
down
it
at
his
utmost
speed
a
moment
after
him
a
woman
with
breathless
haste
entered
by
the
same
door
o
alla
grant
she
exclaimed
thou
who
didst
soften
my
heart
grant
i
may
not
be
too
late

o

o

rhyan
if
i
be
in
time
something
hath
happened
jaffar
and
the
khan
fled
past
me
alla
alla
how
he
looked
she
hurried
through
the
courts
traversed
the
little
verandah
and
darted
into
the
room
her
sight
for
an
instant
failed
her
there
was
a
pool
of
blood
on
the
white
musnud
and
the
lady
lay
white
sheet
and
long
hair
dabbled
in
it
for
an
instant
her
heart
was
sick
but
she
rallied
herself
if
there
is
only
life
meeran
meeran
where
art

meeran
advancing
from
the
other
door
in
the
court
before
them
it
is
i

may
yet
save

what
a
gash
exclaimed
both
turning
their
heads
away
from
the
horrid
sight
for
an
instant
but
she
is
warm
said
meeran
apostle
of
alla
there
may
be
life
hold
her
while
i
run
for
my
is
he
came
quickly
for
a
long
time
they
doubted
if
she
would
revive
and
her
first
breath
was
hailed
with
a
burst
of
joy
i
know
a
secure
place
said
sozun
she
is
not
safe
here
she
will
be
discovered
by
the
khan
and
he
will
kill
art
thou
to
be
trusted
sozun
said
meeran
it
was
thou
who
didst
cause
this
murder
and
i
mistrust
alla
who
sees
my
heart
knows
how
true
it
is
said
the
woman
and
how
bitter
is
my
repentance
ye
may
leave
this
poor
flower
if
ye
will
but
never
while
sozun
hath
life
will
she
depart
from
her
come
weal
come
and
as
she
said
it
she
looked
up
fervently
and
when
meeran
saw
that
her
eyes
glistened
with
tears
which
fell
over
on
her
her
features
were
quivering
and
her
lips
moved
in
silent
prayer
then
she
believed
her
and
yielded
to
the
necessity
of
the
moment
zoolficar
with
their
assistance
bound
up
the
wound
which
had
cut
deeply
into
the
shoulder
and
neck
and
had
bled
much
and
they
now
laid
the
lady
in
the
dooly
only
that
she
sighed
now
and
then
she
would
have
been
thought
to
be
dead
but
there
was
life
and
while
life
was
in
the
nostrils
there
was
hope
the
bearers
who
had
been
ready
without
from
the
first
were
now
called
and
preceded
by
sozun
they
went
on
till
they
stopped
at
an
obscure
house
behind
the
principal
bazaar
in
an
unfrequented
part
of
the
fort
the
lady
still
lived
when
they
lifted
her
out
of
the
dooly
and
laid
here
upon
as
soft
and
easy
a
bed
as
the
house
afforded
kasim
ali
passed
a
wild
and
restless
comparison
of
which
that
upon
the
when
the
jackal
and
hyena
had
howled
around
him
was
remembered
with
pleasure
he
searched
every
corner
of
the
fort
every
ravelin
every
bastion
the
most
miserable
purlieus
of
the
bazaar
which
rung
with
wild
shouts
of
revelry
of
drunkenness
and
debauchery
he
went
into
the
thickest
and
hottest
of
the
fire
where
shot
and
shells
and
the
deadly
grape
whistled
around
him
he
examined
every
group
of
men
but
saw
neither
the
khan
nor
jaffar
twice
he
returned
to
his
ere
he
had
been
long
absent
dreading
to
behold
again
that
beauteous
form
lying
in
its
blood
and
disfigured
by
the
gaping
wound
it
was
not
misery
he
thought
was
spared
him
by
the
kind
meeran
and
her
brother
they
have
taken
it
away
to
bury
he
thought
but
where
he
knew
morning
would
reveal
her
blood
lay
there
clotted
upon
the
white
muslin
a
horrible
evidence
of
the
crime
that
had
been
committed
he
sought
not
to
remove
it
but
it
reminded
him
of
the
state
of
his
own
garments
which
were
saturated
he
changed
them
and
again
sallied
out
he
returned
towards
morning
and
wrote
a
few
lines
to
the
only
other
friend
he
possessed
a
moolah
of
the
mosque
in
the
fort
to
whom
he
had
willed
that
his
little
property
should
be
given
in
case
of
his
death
and
the
khan
s
in
trust
for
his
mother
they
were
a
few
lines
only
to
tell
of
his
fate
and
for
the
second
time
he
went
forth
to
seek
death
in
the
hot
battle
he
found
it
not
however
all
that
night
and
sick
at
heart
as
the
morning
broke
over
the
beleaguered
city
he
entered
the
court
of
the
mosque
from
the
tall
minarets
of
which
the
muezzin
was
proclaiming
the
morning
prayer
it
will
calm
me
he
said
to
join
in
as
he
entered
he
met
his
friend
the
moolah
he
could
not
resist
the
impulse
his
spirit
was
oppressed
and
he
again
requested
the
moolah
s
kind
administration
of
his
property
in
case
of
his
death
and
the
remission
of
its
proceeds
to
his
mother
such
requests
were
not
uncommon
at
that
period
and
death
was
too
busy
in
the
fort
for
every
man
not
to
prepare
for
his
own
end
the
sultaun
arrived
soon
after
from
his
early
circuit
of
the
walls
attended
by
his
chief
officers
and
the
morning
prayer
commenced
it
was
finished
and
men
arose
and
were
preparing
to
depart
stay
cried
the
sultaun
we
would
speak
to
and
as
he
cast
his
eye
around
ye
all
here
love
me
he
said
in
so
melancholy
a
tone
that
most
were
touched
by
it
ye
syud
sahib
syud
ghuffoor
bakir
sahib
and
thou
kasim
ali
who
once
saved
me
ye
are
all
here
alas
there
are
but
few
remaining
like
you
how
many
have
been
faithless
who
have
eaten
my
salt
for
years
glory
is
light
of
the
earth
the
star
of
islam
is
quenched
no
more
triumphs
to
the
is
dark
before
us
hear
ye
what
we
have
come
to
we
asked
for
peace
at
the
hands
of
the
asked
the
cause
of
this
unjustifiable
we
were
insulted
and
bearded
in
our
very
capital
but
no
answer
is
returned
the
insatiate
thirst
of
power
and
conquest
is
apparent
in
the
reply
of
the
kafir
cornwallis
there
was
perfect
silence
every
man
felt
that
the
sultaun
s
spirit
was
broken
and
melancholy
was
upon
every
face
as
he
unfolded
a
letter
and
mounting
a
step
of
the
pulpit
began
to
read
it
was
short
and
there
were
few
ceremonious
expressions
to
resign
half
his
territories
to
pay
the
cost
of
the
war
and
to
surrender
his
sons
as
hostages
were
the
humiliating
terms
proposed
and
as
they
heard
it
a
burst
of
indignation
arose
from
the
assembly
which
rung
through
the
lofty
arches
and
fretted
roof
of
the
mosque
i
thank
you
friends
and
brothers
he
said
ye
feel
for
bless
ye
that
ye
have
hearts
for
the
unfortunate
but
will
you
bear
this
will
ye
whose
victorious
arms
have
ere
now
vanquished
the
kafirs
will
ye
submit
to
these
insults
if
all
in
this
fort
were
as
true
as
we
are
cried
syud
ghuffoor
there
would
be
no
fear
but
alas
the
tremble
for
their
lives
as
every
english
shot
strikes
the
wall
and
there
are
thousands
alla
be
merciful
to
me
said
the
sultaun
bowing
his
head
are
they
so
faithless
what
say
ye
sirs
many
replied
but
only
a
few
could
answer
for
the
men
and
then
many
wept
passionately
the
grief
of
those
strong
warriors
was
moving
to
look
on
and
are
we
to
die
die
like
dogs
like
wild
beasts
in
a
cage
broke
out
the
sultaun
frantically
and
throwing
his
turban
on
the
ground
to
have
our
children
torn
from
us
our
wives
defiled
before
our
eyes
to
be
plundered
of
our
from
our
in
the
dust
are
we
to
bear
this
from
kafirs
from
hogs
too
holy
alla
and
mahomed
the
apostle
are
we
to
suffer
this
indignity
are
we
to
be
so
beaten
down
sirs
have
ye
no
hearts
where
is
your
vaunted
bravery
ye
have
eaten
my
salt
ye
have
grown
rich
where
ye
were
ye
no
gratitude
have
ye
no
faith
we
have
we
have
cried
one
and
all
of
that
assembly
we
will
die
at
your
feet
our
lives
are
in
your
the
infidels
are
before
for
whose
presence
ye
have
often
longed
to
prove
your
prowess
will
ye
swear
before
alla
and
here
in
his
house
to
be
faithful
to
me
his
servant
to
your
sultaun
then
arose
the
oaths
of
all
in
hoarse
tones
as
they
waved
their
arms
on
high
and
swore
to
be
faithful
till
death
tis
well
he
said
else
ye
had
been
kafirs
fit
only
to
herd
with
the
vile
i
bless
ye
o
my
friends
alla
who
sees
my
aching
heart
knows
that
i
believe
you
to
the
in
prosperity
true
now
in
adversity
while
have
often
deceived
ye
often
been
capricious
will
ye
forgive
me
i
am
no
sultaun
now
but
a
poor
worm
before
alla
meaner
than
yourselves
will
ye
forgive
me
then
the
passionate
gestures
and
exclamations
of
devotion
to
him
by
the
enthusiasts
knew
no
bounds
and
their
wild
and
frantic
cries
and
expressions
of
service
unto
the
shedding
of
their
hearts
forth
without
control
those
without
and
the
soldiery
caught
up
the
wild
excitement
thronged
into
the
mosque
and
filled
the
steps
and
the
court
uttering
violent
exclamations
blessed
be
alla
your
old
fire
is
still
within
you
cried
tippoo
and
were
i
but

would
disperse
like

might
pursue
them

no

of

into

to
the
seventy
virgins
and
undying
unknown
to
each
other
and
from
opposite
sides
two
men
dashed
forward
eagerly
to
claim
that
service
of
danger
the
one
was
kasim
ali
the
other
a
man
from

eyes
and

both
saluted
him
profoundly
and
then
turning
their
eyes
met
come
said
the
khan
we
there
was
a
burst
of
admiration
from
the
shout
which
rose
and
spread
abroad
to
those
without
who
will
follow
rhyman
khan
he
cried
aloud
whoever
will
let
him
meet
me
at
the
southern
gate
in
and
so
saying
he
hurried
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
his
home
all
was
confusion
there
for
the
lady
ameena
with
sozun
and
meeran
were
missing
he
ordered
his
best
horse
to
be
prepared
for
action
and
without
speaking
he
passed
into
the
apartments
of
ameena
and
fastened
the
door
they
were
as
she
had
left
had
been
disturbed
her
larks
were
singing
cheerily
her
looree
which
knew
him
well
fluttered
its
bright
wings
and
screaming
tried
to
fly
to
him
her
gazelle
ran
up
with
a
merry
frisk
and
rubbed
its
nose
against
his
hand
and
butted
gently
with
its
forehead
gazing
at
him
with
its
large
soft
eyes
her
flowers
were
fresh
and
bright
and
their
odour
was
sweet
in
the
cool
morning
air
his
eye
wandered
around
every
object
was
there
but
she
whose
joyous
smile
and
sweet
tones
had
made
a
heaven
of
the
place
where
was
she
dead
and
cold
he
thought
disfigured
in
death
by
his
own
hand
he
cast
himself
frantically
on
the
bed
which
remained
in
disorder
even
as
she
had
left
it
and
groaned
aloud
how
long
he
lay
there
he
knew
not
he
had
no
thought
of
present
time
only
of
the
past
the
blissful
past
which
floated
before
his
mental
vision
a
bitter
mockery
some
one
knocked
it
recalled
him
to
his
senses
they
wait
said
daood
the
patél
and
a
hundred
others
he
has
sent
for
i
come
cried
the
khan
i
come
it
was
well
he
remembered
me
he
seeks
death
as
i
do
he
added
mentally
the
lady
kummoo
would
speak
to
thee
said
a
slave
as
he
passed
out
tell
her
i
go
to
death
he
replied
sternly
tell
her
i
follow
the
girl
stared
at
him
as
though
the
words
had
stunned
her
gazed
after
him
as
he
passed
on
saw
him
spring
quickly
into
his
saddle
and
dashing
his
heels
into
his
noble
charger
bound
onwards
at
a
desperate
speed
tis
well
thou
art
come
khan
said
kasim
ali
we
have
waited
for
hush
why
seekest
thou
death
thou
art
not
fitted
to
die
more
fit
than
thou
old
man
was
his
reply
come
they
remark
thee
when
we
are
before
the
judgment
thou
wilt
know
all
come
the
khan
laughed
scornfully
for
he
remembered
the
kiss
come
my
friends
he
cried
follow
rhyman
khan
for
the
faith
and
for
islam
bismilla
open
the
for
the
faith
for
islam
cried
the
devoted
band
as
the
heavy
door
opened
and
emerging
from
the
shadow
of
the
gate
and
wall
the
sunlight
glanced
upon
their
naked
weapons
gay
apparel
and
excited
horses
and
they
dashed
in
a
fearful
race
toward
the
camp
show
us
the
tent
of
the
great
commander
cried
kasim
to
a
sentinel
who
stared
at
them
as
they
passed
evidently
taking
them
to
be
a
body
of
the
nizam
s
horse
yonder
said
the
man
pointing
to
one
at
some
distance
follow
kasim
ali
follow
rhyman
khan
were
the
cries
of
the
leaders
both
urging
their
horses
to
full
speed
in
reckless
emulation
they
had
been
observed
however
a
had
watched
them
from
the
first
and
suspected
their
intention
now
he
could
not
be
mistaken
he
flew
to
a
picquet
of
native
soldiers
and
drew
them
up
across
the
very
path
of
the
horsemen
kasim
marked
the
action
as
the
muskets
obeyed
the
word
of
command
he
saw
the
bright
sun
glance
on
a
line
of
levelled
barrels
and
heard
the
sharp
rattle
which
followed
his
horse
stumbled
as
it
fell
he
saw
the
khan
toss
his
arms
wildly
into
the
air
and
reel
in
his
seat
and
the
next
moment
his
affrighted
charger
was
flying
riderless
through
the
camp
he
saw
no
more
he
felt
stunned
for
an
instant
and
his
dead
horse
lay
on
his
exquisite
pain
he
extricated
himself
and
tried
to
leg
failed
him
and
he
fell
again
to
the
was
broken
again
he
looked
around
a
number
of
men
and
horses
lay
confusedly
together
some
writhing
in
pain
and
crying
out
for
mercy
while
the
rest
of
the
band
were
flying
confusedly
to
the
fort
the
sepoys
who
had
fired
ran
up
headed
by
an
english
officer
kasim
had
lost
his
sword
it
lay
at
a
little
distance
and
he
could
not
recover
it
one
of
the
men
seeing
that
he
lived
raised
his
bayonet
as
he
approached
to
kill
him
he
shut
his
eyes
and
repeated
the
kulma
hold
cried
a
voice
do
not
kill
is
an
officer
raise
him
up
and
disarm
thou
art
a
prisoner
said
the
officer
to
kasim
do
not
thou
wounded
my
leg
is
broken
said
kasim
kill
me
i
am
not
fit
to
live
i
have
no
desire
for
poor
fellow
said
the
officer
he
is
in
great
pain
lift
him
up
some
of
ye
and
take
him
to
my
tent
he
is
evidently
an
officer
by
his
dress
and
the
rich
caparisons
of
his
yonder
lies
my
leader
said
kasim
pointing
to
the
khan
raise
me
and
let
me
look
upon
him
once
more
we
were
friends
in
life
until
death
we
should
not
have
been
they
were
touched
by
his
words
and
obeyed
him
the
khan
lay
on
his
face
quite
dead
they
turned
the
body
kasim
looked
upon
the
familiar
were
already
sharp
and
livid
there
was
a
small
hole
in
the
forehead
from
which
a
few
drops
of
black
blood
had
oozed
his
death
had
been
instant
as
thought
kasim
heeded
not
the
pain
he
suffered
he
felt
as
though
his
heart
were
bursting
and
throwing
himself
beside
the
body
wept
passionately
after
a
while
he
tried
to
rise
and
they
assisted
him
that
was
a
gallant
soldier
he
said
to
the
officer
let
him
be
buried
as
one
by
men
of
my
i
will
answer
for
it
said
a
native
officer
stepping
forward
thou
shalt
hear
this
evening
that
the
rites
of
our
faith
have
been
performed
over
him
if
he
was
an
enemy
yet
he
was
a
brother
in
the
faith
of
enough
i
thank
thee
friend
replied
kasim
now
lead
care
not
whether
i
live
or
die
since
those
i
lived
for
are
gone
from
the
but
the
officer
s
curiosity
had
been
excited
by
his
words
and
his
appearance
which
was
eminently
prepossessing
he
was
removed
gently
to
his
tent
and
a
bedding
laid
on
the
ground
a
surgeon
a
friend
of
the
officer
was
sent
for
kasim
s
leg
was
examined
the
thigh
was
badly
fractured
above
the
knee
but
the
operation
was
skilfully
performed
and
in
a
manner
which
surprised
kasim
it
was
bound
up
and
he
was
soon
in
comparative
ease
how
little
he
had
expected
such
kindness
and
when
he
contrasted
it
with
what
would
have
been
an
englishman
s
fate
within
the
fort
his
heart
was
softened
from
the
bigotry
it
had
previously
entertained
the
officer
was
philip
dalton
he
had
long
thought
on
the
possibility
of
saving
some
captive
that
he
might
gain
information
of
the
english
prisoners
and
he
tended
kasim
kindly
in
a
few
days
they
were
better
friends
the
cold
reserve
of
kasim
had
worn
off
before
the
frank
manner
of
the
englishman
and
they
now
conversed
freely
of
the
war
of
their
own
vicissitudes
and
adventures
and
of
the
present
chances
of
success
kasim
soon
perceived
that
all
hope
for
the
sultaun
was
at
an
end
from
the
vigour
of
the
attack
and
the
efficiency
of
the
army
and
he
knew
that
within
the
fort
existed
dread
and
discontent
after
a
while
philip
asked
him
of
the
first
warily
and
only
hinting
at
their
existence
but
kasim
was
faithful
to
his
sultaun
though
he
could
have
told
him
of
the
fearful
murders
which
had
been
openly
mentioned
among
the
army
to
avenge
which
they
supposed
the
english
thirsted
yet
he
did
not
reveal
them
even
though
he
knew
from
philip
s
own
lips
that
the
english
had
been
informed
of
them
by
the
hundreds
who
had
deserted
on
the
night
of
the
first
attack
often
philip
would
ask
him
whether
he
had
ever
known
any
of
the
prisoners
whether
he
had
ever
spoken
with
them
when
on
guard
over
them
or
perchance
escorting
them
from
station
to
station
for
he
knew
that
the
captives
were
frequently
removed
lest
they
should
attack
those
who
attended
them
and
when
kasim
related
to
him
his
interference
in
behalf
of
an
english
prisoner
at
bangalore
and
his
attempt
to
protect
him
in
the
sultaun
s
durbar
risking
his
life
for
him
ere
yet
he
was
himself
in
service
philip
s
cheek
glowed
and
his
heart
throbbed
in
a
silent
conviction
that
it
was
herbert
himself
was
he
tall
and
and
had
he
very
large
blue
eyes
he
asked
anxiously
kasim
recollected
himself
it
was
a
long
time
ago
and
his
memory
appeared
to
have
been
impaired
by
the
late
events
he
had
only
seen
him
in
times
of
great
excitement
but
after
a
long
reflection
he
thought
it
was
the
same
however
the
prisoner
s
features
had
made
little
impression
upon
him
poor
youth
added
kasim
i
saw
him
no
how
what
became
of
him
he
was
doomed
to
die
while
i
was
held
back
by
i
was
saw
him
dragged
away
i
heard
the
sultaun
give
the
fatal
mandate
to
jaffar
man
whose
heart
is
blacker
than
that
of
he
of
whom
thou
hast
told
me
so
much
of
late
ay
the
same
i
heard
mention
made
of
the
fatal
rock
and
the
young
englishman
was
dragged
forth
spat
upon
and
insulted
yet
even
then
he
spoke
to
me
and
said
that
my
action
would
be
remembered
in
the
judgment
alas
i
had
no
power
to
rescue
him
and
he
must
have
gallant
fellow
cried
philip
the
pain
of
that
thought
i
can
save
thee
he
died
not
how
dost
thou
know
what
was
he
to
thee
sahib
he
was
dear
as
a
brother
to
was
my
friend
i
married
his
sister
after
years
of
absence
from
my
native
land
when
we
took
balapoor
i
went
to
the
rock
thou
knowest
was
in
curiosity
only
his
name
was
written
there
and
that
renewed
the
hope
which
had
never
been
dead
within
our
hearts
for
one
of
the
miserable
victims
had
written
that
he
had
been
taken
away
ill
and
by
a
chance
sent
by
providence
we
traced
him
to
a
worthy
fakeer
s
tukea
mayest
remember
it
i
do
a
cool
shady
place
where
the
wearied
wayfarer
is
ever
the
kind
old
man
tended
him
administered
medicine
to
him
he
recovered
and
we
heard
that
he
was
taken
away
by
that
same
jaffar
whom
thou
hast
he
could
not
alas
then
i
fear
there
is
no
hope
of
his
life
jaffar
is
a
devil
yet
in
such
a
matter
he
dare
not
act
without
the
sultaun
s
order
i
remember
he
added
after
a
pause
a
conversation
between
them
about
an
was
before
the
siege
there
was
no
one
else
present
tippoo
spoke
of
one
who
was
skilled
in
fortification
in
the
arts
of
war
and
of
gunnery
far
above
the
french
adventurers
in
his
service
who
after
all
are
but
pretenders
to
science
could
this
be
thy
brother
it
is
it
is
cried
philip
catching
at
the
idea
in
desperation
it
must
be
he
was
eminently
skilled
in
all
your
last
words
determine
the
idea
that
it
was
he
by
your
soul
tell
me
if
you
know
aught
of
alas
no
said
the
young
man
yet
they
concealed
nothing
jaffar
said
it
was
useless
that
he
had
sent
trusty
messengers
to
him
to
the
fort
through
the
jungles
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
with
offers
of
mercy
pardon
wealth
if
he
would
take
service
in
the
army
he
had
spurned
all
and
then
the
sultaun
grew
furious
and
swore
he
might
die
did
he
mention
the
fort
the
place
where
it
was
in
what
direction
asked
philip
eagerly
no
and
i
know
not
sahib
it
is
not
in
this
district
if
he
be
still
alive
he
is
in
one
of
those
lonely
posts
away
to
the
coorg
or
on
the
frontiers
of
malabar
a
little
spot
on
the
top
of
some
lonely
peak
piercing
the
sky
which
is
ever
wrapped
in
clouds
and
mists
with
its
base
surrounded
by
jungles
to
traverse
which
days
and
weeks
are
by
the
rude
and
barbarous
infidels
of
the
mountains
whose
speech
and
appearance
are
hardly
human
it
is
a
horrible
fate
to
think
on
sahib
he
said
shuddering
better
that
he
should
have
died
long
ago
but
after
all
it
may
not
be
your
perhaps
not
said
philip
sighing
and
yet
i
have
hope
and
when
the
fort
is
stormed
and
yon
proud
sultaun
brought
to
the
reckoning
he
deserves
it
will
be
hard
if
we
gain
not
news
of
him
we
may
alla
grant
it
sahib
thou
hast
bound
me
to
thee
by
the
kindness
thou
hast
shown
a
stranger
and
an
enemy
and
i
will
rejoice
even
as
thou
dost
that
thy
friend
and
brother
should
be
saved
but
alas
i
have
little
hope
yet
when
i
recover
and
this
war
is
over
if
i
live
i
will
search
for
thee
and
rescue
god
bless
thee
cried
philip
i
believe
thee
thou
hast
now
known
that
we
are
not
the
miscreants
which
the
bigots
of
the
faith
would
represent
us
to
be
and
if
thou
canst
bring
me
even
news
of
his
death
it
will
be
a
melancholy
satisfaction
and
will
still
the
restless
hopes
which
have
so
long
gnawed
at
our
hearts
and
excited
us
only
to
be
cast
down
into
utter
days
passed
of
constant
success
on
the
part
of
the
english
their
cannon
played
night
and
day
upon
the
breaches
till
they
were
almost
practicable
those
in
the
fort
looked
on
in
sullen
despair
and
abandoned
themselves
to
a
blind
reliance
on
their
destiny
it
was
in
vain
that
tippoo
made
the
most
passionate
appeals
to
them
to
sally
out
and
cut
the
english
army
to
pieces
it
was
in
vain
he
read
to
them
the
humiliating
demands
of
the
allies
in
vain
he
raved
as
he
saw
the
groves
of
his
favourite
and
beautiful
gardens
levelled
with
the
earth
and
transported
to
construct
fascines
and
gabions
for
new
parallels
and
trenches
the
sorties
were
weak
and
driven
back
with
loss
and
with
the
remembrance
of
the
fatal
issue
of
that
led
by
rhyman
khan
and
kasim
ali
no
one
dared
to
hazard
a
similar
attempt
though
rewards
beyond
thought
were
offered
by
the
frantic
monarch
the
murmurs
within
gradually
increased
as
the
breaches
widened
daily
and
men
looked
to
the
issue
of
the
storm
in
fearful
dread
women
shrieked
in
the
streets
and
men
were
everywhere
seen

in

yielding
to

the

though
the
maddened
english
could
hardly
be
restrained
from
rushing
into
the
fort
and
searching
its
most
secret
apartments
and
for
their
unhappy
countrymen
they
were
kept
back
and
the
negotiations
proceeded
the
event
is
already
matter
of
history
and
we
are
not
historians
although
even
his
children
had
gone
from
him
as
hostages
into
the
british
camp
in
a
paroxysm
of
passion
the
sultaun
desperately
refused
the
cession
of
coorg
to
its
rightful
owner
whom
he
had
of
the
terms
of
the
treaty
but
which
he
well
knew
if
yielded
would
open
a
road
into
the
heart
of
his
dominions
at
any
time
the
stern
resolution
of
the
english
presence
of
his
victorious
army
the
threats
of
which
were
openly
stated
to
him
by
his
general
discontent
and
dread
which
pervaded
all
in
spite
of
his
appeals
to
their
pride
their
bigotry
and
their
repair
of
the
breach
while
the
english
cannon
conspired
to
check
their
spirit
he
sullenly
yielded
to
a
destiny
he
could
not
avert
and
accepting
the
conditions
he
delivered
up
those
captives
who
were
known
to
be
in
the

what
agonising
apprehension
did

fly
from

aged
and
careworn
from
misery
and
long
confinement
while
others
having
been
forcibly
converted
to
the
faith
of

now
openly
abjured
its
tenets
and
flung
away
their
turbans
and
other
emblems
of
their
degraded
condition
alas
herbert
compton
was
not
among

nor
could
any

tell
of
his

though
his

was
remembered
vividly

it
was
known
among

from

was
dead
that
he
had
not
perished
at

for

that

all

true
for
a

they
thought
that
one
of
the
strongholds

might
contain
their
poor
friend
but
there
too
they
were
disappointed
and
there
was
no

a
straw
floating
upon
the
waters
of
expectation
at
which
they
could
catch
in
desperation
and
hope
which
had
been
for
years
buoyant
sank
within
them
for
ever
the
news
of
the
victory
reached
england
the
nation
rejoiced
at
the
triumph
that
their
bitterest
enemy
in
the
east
had
been
humbled
and
despoiled
of
his
fair
provinces
and
that
the
political
horizon
of
their
already
increasing
possessions
was
once
more
clear
but
there
were
two
families
among
the
many
who
mourned
for
those
who
had
met
a
soldier
s
death
which
though
the
bereavement
was
not
a
present
one
yet
felt
it
as
acutely
as
if
it
had
been
recent
nay
more
so
since
their
hopes
had
been
so
long
excited
they
knew
not
that
amy
had
ever
thought
there
was
hope
of
herbert
s
life
but
long
ere
letters
came
when
it
was
known
that
the
army
was
in
mysore
they
saw
her
look
for
every
succeeding
dispatch
with
more
and
more
impatience
and
a
feverish
anxiety
she
could
not
conceal
and
when
the
end
came
they
knew
from
her
agonised
burst
of
bitter
grief
that
she
too
had
lingered
in
hope
even
as
they
had
but
amy
s
was
a
strong
mind
and
one
which
her
affliction
though
deep
and
heavy
to
bear
had
never
driven
into
repining
she
looked
with
earnest
hope
to
the
future
and
in
reliance
on
the
divine
power
and
wisdom
which
she
had
early
practised
and
which
never
failed
her
in
her
need
she
drew
from
that
pure
source
consolation
which
those
who
loved
her
most
dearly
could
not
impart
she
had
lived
on
a
life
of
meek
and
cheerful
piety
almost
adored
by
the
neighbourhood
and
in
sweet
intercourse
with
those
around
her
whose
constant
care
for
her
was
amply
repaid
by
her
devoted
affection

the
sultaun
was
not
humbled
by
the
issue
of
the
campaign
though
for
a
time
his
resources
were
straitened
on
the
contrary
he
burned
with
revenge
for
the
indignity
which
he
had
suffered
superadded
to
the
fierce
hate
for
the
english
which
he
had
ever
retained
and
which
rose
now
to
a
degree
of
ferocity
he
could
hardly
restrain
the
demand
of
three
millions
and
a
half
sterling
made
for
the
expenses
of
the
which
and
the
relinquishment
of
the
territory
he
had
agreed
to
resign
his
children
were
held
as
met
partly
by
a
payment
from
his
own
treasury
partly
by
a
demand
upon
his
army
and
his
civil
officers
and
the
residue
was
directed
to
be
raised
in
the
provinces
where
means
were
employed
for
the
purpose
at
which
humanity
shudders
mild
as
had
been
his
civil
administration
previously
and
flourishing
as
was
the
cultivation
of
his
whole
country
under
the
admirable
administration
of
purneah
his
finance
in
marked
contrast
to
the
desolation
of
the
english
provinces
where
the
rule
of
englishmen
was
not
understood
nor
their
information
as
yet
equal
to
the
complexity
of
revenue
now
ensued
a
remarkable
contrast
as
the
oppression
and
forced
contribution
proceeded
with
horrible
rigour
thousands
fled
into
the
english
possessions
where
they
were
received
and
protected
and
this
while
it
did
not
check
the
infatuated
persecution
of
many
of
his
people
in
whose
welfare
lay
his
own
safety
added
fresh
cause
for
his
hatred
of
those
from
whose
protecting
sway
he
could
not
withdraw
them
meanwhile
his
restless
mind
embraced
every
subject
which
came
or
which
he
fancied
could
come
within
his
grasp
astrology
and
magic
with
all
their
absurd
and
debasing
rites
were
studied
with
greater
avidity
and
attention
than
ever
under
the
guidance
of
some
who
had
pretensions
to
those
sciences
both
brahmins
and
mahomedans
from
them
he
drew
the
most
magnificent
auguries
of
his
future
brilliant
destiny
the
past
he
said
was
but
a
cloud
which
as
he
had
ascertained
from
the
stars
had
hung
over
him
from
his
birth
it
was
now
dissipated
melted
into
thin
air
before
the
bright
beams
of
the
rising
sun
of
his
destiny
physic
too
absorbed
his
attention
to
perfection
in
which
he
made
vast
pretensions
by
aid
of
a
thermometer
the
true
use
of
which
he
declared
he
had
discovered
by
a
revelation
from
the
angel
gabriel
with
whom
he
seemed
to
have
established
in
his
dreams
a
perfect
confidence
it
is
only
necessary
he
would
say
for
a
sick
man
to
hold
the
bulb
in
his
hand
and
then
as
the
mercury
rose
or
fell
so
was
the
disease
hot
or
cold
and
according
to
its
scale
of
progression
so
should
the
remedies
differing
in
potency
be
applied
often
he
would
in
his
caprice
remark
upon
the
altered
look
of
any
one
present
in
his
court
and
in
spite
of
their
protestations
of
perfect
health
apply
the
test
and
administer
a
remedy
upon
the
spot
which
it
would
have
been
death
almost
to
refuse
the
news
of
the
revolutionary
movement
of
in
france
also
for
which
he
had
been
gradually
prepared
by
the
adventurers
in
his
service
infected
him
with
a
restless
desire
of
imitation
which
ran
into
the
most
ludicrous
and
often
mischievous
channels
as
the
french
names
of
years
and
months
were
altered
so
were
his
a
new
era
was
instituted
and
this
being
in
direct
opposition
to
the
precepts
of
the
koran
which
direct
an
implicit
observance
of
them
he
had
recourse
to
his
dreams
and
visions
once
more
by
which
it
was
for
the
while
established
in
all
departments
of
finance
of
the
army
of
agriculture
of
justice
there
were
perpetual
alterations
sometimes
undoubtedly
with
good
effect
at
others
the
most
puerile
and
absurd
words
of
command
invented
from
the
persian
language
were
given
to
his
army
and
new
orders
for
their
regulation
and
discipline
constantly
promulgated
he
contemplated
a
fleet
to
exterminate
the
english
one
which
having
before
defeated
the
french
had
prevented
them
from
sending
such
succour
to
his
aid
as
he
had
expected
one
hundred
ships
of
immense
force
was
to
be
the
complement
of
these
forty
were
directed
to
be
commenced
at
tellicherry
mangalore
and
his
other
ports
on
the
western
coast
and
officers
were
appointed
to
them
commanders
and
admirals
who
had
never
even
seen
the
sea
had
no
conception
what
a
ship
was
save
from
the
descriptions
of
others
some
of
these
men
were
sent
to
superintend
their
completion
others
retained
at
court
for
instruction
in
the
science
of
navigation
and
naval
warfare
in
which
as
in
his
military
pretensions
his
dreams
visions
and
assumed
revelations
alone
assisted
him
he
was
merchant
and
by
turns
and
huge
warehouses
which
still
exist
in
the
fort
of
seringapatam
long
open
rooms
in
the
palace
capable
of
containing
vast
quantities
of
merchandise
were
filled
with
every
description
of
goods
which
in
time
he
forgot
entirely
and
so
they
remained
till
his
death
by
his
system
of
banking
and
of
regulating
as
he
imagined
in
his
own
person
the
exchanges
of
his
dominions
he
put
a
stop
to
the
operations
of
the
bankers
of
his
capital
by
whose
assistance
alone
he
was
able
to
administer
his
affairs
nor
would
they
resume
their
business
until
he
agreed
to
abandon
this
one
of
the
thousand
schemes
which
were
on
foot
for
fame
and
aggrandisement
new
and
perplexing
laws
were
for
ever
being
coined
in
the
fertile
mint
of
his
own
brain
new
interpretations
of
the
koran
which
he
pretended
to
receive
by
inspiration
when
in
reality
he
understood
not
a
word
of
its
language
and
very
indifferently
persian
in
which
the
commentaries
upon
it
were
written
the
penal
enactments
against
the
lower
classes
of
his
hindoo
subjects
were
horrible
the
meanest
offences
the
wearing
of
any
scrap
of
green
the
sacred
colour
of
mahomed
about
their
persons
or
the
transgression
of
any
one
of
his
arbitrary
rules
was
punished
with
death
or
obscene
mutilations
to
which
death
would
have
been
far
preferable
these
were
often
done
in
his
own
presence
and
with
jaffar
sahib
madar
who
had
once
been
his
servant
but
who
had
risen
in
rank
and
many
others
he
was
at
no
loss
for
instruments
to
carry
them
into
execution
he
would
call
himself
the
tiger
of
the
beloved
friend
of
mahomed
and
while
he
arrogated
to
himself
the
last
title
the
impiety
of
which
shocked
the
religious
among
his
officers
he
acted
up
to
the
first
not
only
in
words
but
in
deeds
such
as
we
have
alluded
to
cursorily
by
dressing
his
infantry
in
cotton
jackets
printed
in
tiger
s
stripes
sitting
on
the
effigy
of
one
for
a
throne
and
by
having
two
large
ones
chained
in
the
courtyard
of
his
palace
who
were
often
made
the
executioners
of
his
terrible
will
many
are
the
tales
too
even
now
very
current
in
the
country
of
the
ludicrous
effects
of
his
inspirations
regarding
particular
people
whom
for
some
fancied
lucky
termination
or
commencement
of
their
name
or
some
meaning
he
chose
to
attach
to
it
a
fortunate
horoscope
or
even
from
lucky
personal
marks
he
would
select
from
the
meanest
ranks
to
fill
offices
for
which
they
were
alike
unfitted
by
education
talents
or
acquirements
and
who
when
their
incapacity
was
detected
were
mercilessly
disgraced
it
has
been
said
of
him
by
an
eminent
historian
whose
account
of
the
period
is
a
vivid
romance
from
first
to
last
that
his
were
the
pranks
of
a
monkey
with
the
abominations
of
a
monster
and
indeed
it
is
impossible
to
give
an
idea
of
his
character
in
juster
terms

travel

proceeded

for

continued
attendance
of

english
surgeon
under
whose
care
he
was
placed
to
this
he
had
agreed
for
in
truth
the
representations
of
the
englishman
had
set
many
matters
before
him
in
a
new
light
and
he
now
looked
upon
acts
of
the
sultaun
with
abhorrence
which
he
had
before
considered
as
justifiable
nay
meritorious
when
exercised
upon
infidels
whether
hindoos
or
english
and
having
accompanied
philip
to
bangalore
he
parted
from
him
there
with
regret
and
with
a
strong
sense
of
his
kind
and
generous
behaviour
promising
that
should
he
ever
discover
any
clue
to
the
fate
of
poor
herbert
he
would
write
for
the
nations
being
now
on
good
terms
the
communications
were
open
and
he
could
do
so
with
safety
for
a
long
while
however
he
was
unfit
to
move
he
made
a
report
of
his
escape
to
the
sultaun
and
receiving
in
return
an
honorary
dress
for
his
gallant
behaviour
he
was
assured
that
his
rank
remained
to
was
increased
and
having
solicited
leave
of
absence
he
returned
to
his
village
to
regain
in
its
quiet
seclusion
the
strength
and
peace
of
mind
he
had
lost
of
ameena
he
never
thought
but
as
one
dead
for
though
he
had
written
to
his
friend
the
moola
to
endeavour
to
trace
her
fate
and
to
discover
where
she
had
been
buried
in
order
that
he
might
have
the
melancholy
satisfaction
of
erecting
a
tomb
over
her
remains
yet
she
could
not
be
traced
nor
her
attendants

were
supposed
to
have
escaped
to

in
the
confusion
which
ensued
after

her

made
for
his

regularly
drawn
up

long
before

with

executors

in

thus
raised
to

handsome
independence

he
spared
no
pains
to
make
his
mother
s
declining
years
as
happy
as
was
possible
a
new
and
handsome
abode
was
erected

troublous
times

new

was
built
and
a
neat

near
the

tomb
marked
the
spot
in
which
he
had
rescued

this
was
his
favourite
resort
where
of
an
evening
spreading
a
carpet
beneath
the
trees
he
would
remain
in
conversation
with
those
he
loved
and
respected
the
elders
of
his
village
both
hindoo
and
mahomedan
or
else
in
silent
and
sad
thought
on
the
past
the
happiness
which
had
been
so
rudely
dashed
from
his
lips
his
health
continued
very
indifferent
and
from
time
to
time
his
leave
of
absence
was
renewed
however
at
length
he
could
delay
no
longer
and
he
once
more
resumed
his
attendance
at

court
of

sultaun
it
was
not
however
with
the
same
feelings
of
indifference
that
he
now
regarded
the
monstrous
acts
of

his
mind
had
been
purged
from
the
dross

bigotry

his
residence
in
the
english
camp
where
besides
philip
dalton
s
society
there
were
many
others
who
either
out
of
curiosity
or
to
while
away
a
tedious
hour
of
ennui
would
come
to
the
of
the
jemadar
and
listen
to
his
conversation
relating
in
turn
tales
of
their
own
green
land
which
to
kasim
s
senses
appeared
a
paradise
jaffar
sahib
was
an
offence
in
his
sight
and
his
increased
favour
with
the
sultaun
his
constant
attendance
on
his
person
and
at
the
durbar
his
now
fearful
reputation
and
the
memory
of
the
past
for
kasim
felt
sure
he
was
connected
with
that
fatal
night
and
ameena
s
death
as
well
as
the
fate
of
the
young
englishmen
caused
a
total
revulsion
of
feeling
towards
the
monarch
and
he
felt
his
situation
becoming
daily
more
distasteful
to
him
in
spite
of
the
splendid
prospects
which
were
undoubtedly
in
the
distance
kasim
too
was
a
good
mussulman
he
was
regular
in
his
prayers
and
hated
innovations
and
the
endless
capricious
changes
the
blasphemous
conduct
of
the
sultaun
and
his
pretensions
to
supernatural
devotion
to
unholy
and
magical
rites
which
were
openly
mentioned
and
above
all
his
acts
of
cruelty
and
him
and
some
others
of
his
own
character
to
abandon
a
service
in
which
their
high
notions
of
justice
decency
and
piety
were
daily
outraged
by
the
partition
treaty
also
the
territory
in
which
were
situated
the
villages
of
kasim
ali
had
been
transferred
to
the
nizam
and
he
at
last
found
it
impossible
to
serve
two
masters
as
long
as
he
remained
at
home
the
authorities
dreaded
him
and
were
quiet
but
after
a
time
a
system
of
annoyance
commenced
of
which
he
had
such
frequent
accounts
that
he
was
soon
left
no
resource
between
selling
his
patrimony
and
cleaving
for
ever
to
the
ruler
of
mysore
or
abandoning
his
service
and
retiring
into
seclusion
had
the
sultaun
s
conduct
not
shocked
him
by
its
levity
and
brutality
he
might
have
sold
his
villages
and
withdrawn
his
family
into
mysore
but
he
shrank
from
that
and
having
converted
his
property
into
bills
on
hyderabad
adoni
or
other
towns
which
were
readily
negotiable
in
the
district
he
belonged
to
he
prepared
himself
for
a
journey
and
formally
tendered
his
resignation
to
the
sultaun
in
open
durbar
there
were
many
of
his
friends
who
had
advised
him
to
ask
for
leave
and
write
his
intention
of
not
returning
from
his
own
home
but
he
thought
this
a
cowardly
manner
of
proceeding
and
determined
that
his
memory
should
not
be
reproached
with
cowardice
and
that
it
should
remain
as
it
stood
high
among
those
who
were
honoured
in
the
army
at
an
evening
durbar
therefore
when
all
were
present
and
many
eyes
fixed
on
him
for
his
resolution
was
known
he
arose
stepped
forward
and
having
made
the
tusleemat
said
to
the
sultaun
your
slave
would
make
a
petition
if
he
is
permitted
surely
said
the
sultaun
what
did
kasim
ali
ever
say
that
was
not
welcome
my
lord
he
began
it
is
hard
for
one
who
hath
received
benefits
at
thy
hands
and
who
in
a
bright
prospect
before
glorious
career
of
the
lion
of
the
no
end
but
advancement
to
shut
it
out
from
his
sight
and
to
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
seeing
day
by
day
the
light
of
lion
of
the
faith
o
sultaun
be
merciful
to
thy
servant
and
forgive
the
request
he
makes
that
he
may
retire
from
thy
service
into
the
obscurity
and
quiet
he
has
long
coveted
it
is
well
known
to
all
this
assembly
that
thy
slave
is
one
to
whom
the
stirring
events
of
life
have
no
intrigues
the
factions
the
wavering
politics
of
a
court
no
attraction
if
i
have
hitherto
preserved
my
place
here
it
has
been
by
kindness
and
forbearance
not
by
merit
another
far
more
fitted
than
i
am
will
succeed
me
and
i
shall
be
content
in
the
administration
of
my
property
which
distant
as
it
is
requires
my
constant
attention
and
tippoo
stared
at
him
and
kasim
felt
uncomfortable
he
could
not
remember
that
any
one
had
ever
made
such
a
request
before
and
he
could
not
foresee
the
result
yet
the
sultaun
had
been
in
good
humour
all
the
day
and
he
hoped
for
the
best
what
do
i
hear
kasim
thou
wouldst
leave
my
service
even
so
huzrut
when
thou
wast
in
peril
of
thy
life
mine
was
risked
freely
though
others
hung
back
i
and
he
that
is
his
memory
live
in
honour
those
into
the
english
camp
who
might
have
ended
the
war
had
alla
so
willed
it
in
adversity
i
stood
by
thee
and
i
have
not
quitted
thee
since
for
these
six
years
thou
art
now
prosperous
the
french

thy
friends

art
courted
by
the
nations

thou
art
at
peace
with
the
may
this
art
prosperous
everywhere
and
now
when
all
is
fair
and
bright
around
thee
i
would
in
the
season
of
joy
take
my
leave
grateful
for
a
thousand
benefactions
from
the
liberal
hand
of
him
who
has
not
ceased
to
uphold
me
since
i
was
a
thou
art
joking
kasim
ali
said
tippoo
and
yet
thou
hast
a
serious
face
by
your
soul
say
this
is
not
meant
it
is
in
very
truth
o
prince
i
have
long
meditated
it
i
waited
only
till
my
lord
s
mind
was
happy
and
free
from
care
to
announce
it
for
i
would
not
have
my
memory
linked
with
painful
recollections
but
with
pleasant
the
sultaun
s
brow
darkened
thou
art
considerate
young
man
he
said
bitterly
when
i
was
happy
and
merry
in
my
heart
thou
must
needs
mar
all
by
this
news
by
alla
i
would
rather
thou
hadst
told
it
when
the
storm
within
me
was
at
the
highest
but
no
matter
thou
hast
served
us
well
and
shall
long
remember
it
nor
would
we
detain
any
one
against
his
will
we
have
blessed
be
the
prophet
hundreds
in
our
valiant
army
to
fill
vacant
places
therefore
hast
thy
leave
yet
thou
shalt
not
have
it
to
say
i
was
churlish
in
this
thou
art
dismissed
with
honour
bring
hither
two
shawls
a
turban
and
an
ornament
for
the
a
noble
horse
from
my
stables
and
a
sword
and
shield
from
the
private
armoury
he
cried
to
an
attendant
ye
shall
see
sirs
how
tippoo
estimates
greatness
and
how
he
rewards
kasim
was
much
moved
he
had
expected
a
stormy
scene
an
absolute
refusal
he
had
prepared
himself
for
it
and
for
flight
if
necessary
now
he
could
have
cried
like
a
child
all
the
sultaun
s
caprice
cruelty
and
impiety
were
forgotten
there
sate
before
him
the
benefactor
and
the
steady
friend
of
years
he
continued
gazing
on
him
and
often
he
felt
the
tears
rush
to
his
eyes
as
though
they
would
have
had
vent
the
attendant
entered
with
a
tray
upon
it
were
a
pair
of
magnificent
shawls
of
cashmere
a
superb
mundeel
and
a
jewel
of
great
value
for
the
forehead
the
sultaun
examined
them
with
the
air
of
a
merchant
they
are
a
handsome
pair
and
worthy
of
him
he
said
and
this
too
is
rich
and
the
diamonds
of
good
water
approach
kasim
ali
he
obeyed
the
sultaun
arose
cast
over
his
shoulders
the
rich
shawls
took
the
turban
and
jewel
from
the
tray
and
presented
him
with
them
embrace
me
he
said
i
love
thee
i
shall
ever
remember
thee
gratefully
kasim
ali
and
thou
wilt
not
forget
the
poor
servant
of
alla
tippoo
sultaun
should
his
enemies
revile
him
there
will
be
one
whose
tongue
will
speak
his
praise
shouldst
thou
ever
feel
disposed
to
return
thy
place
is
open
to
thee
or
if
as
a
guest
thou
art
ever
welcome
alla
keep
thee
never
will
i
forget
thee
o
benefactor
cried
kasim
completely
overcome
never
will
i
allow
a
word
to
be
said
against
thee
and
in
my
the
wide
i
go
men
shall
know
of
the
generosity
of
the
lion
of
mysore
i
prayers
are
for
thee
and
thy
prosperity
night
and
kasim
made
low
obeisances
as
he
passed
out
of
the
he
cast
a
last
look
round
the
place
what
scenes
he
had
witnessed
there
of
joy
and
misery
frantic
enthusiasm
and
fierce
bigotry
torture
and
even
death
dreams
visions
lewd
and
vile
torrents
of
abuse
against
the
english
poems
letters
of
war
of
intrigue
of
policy
of
every
conceivable
kind
enough
they
were
gone
for
ever
and
he
was
glad
that
the
feverish
existence
was
at
an
end
henceforth
before
him
was
the
peaceful
and
quiet
existence
he
had
so
long
coveted
the
horse
richly
caparisoned
stood
at
the
and
men
bearing
the
sword
and
shield
kasim
bounded
into
the
saddle
and
before
the
admiring
spectators
many
of
them
his
kind
friends
caused
him
to
curvet
and
bound
to
show
how
perfectly
the
animal
was
trained
and
then
saluting
them
he
rode
on
next
morning
he
was
on
his
way
beyond
the
fort
that
night
jaffar
was
alone
with
the
sultaun
they
had
conversed
long
on
various
matters
at
last
jaffar
exclaimed
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
it
was
wrong
to
let
kasim
ali
why
said
tippoo
he
knows
too
much
was
the
reply
but
he
is
faithful
jaffar
the
fellow
laughed
he
is
a
good
friend
to
the
to
the
english
ay
remember
how
often
he
has
spoken
in
their
favour
how
often
he
has
bearded
others
who
reviled
them
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
he
is
unfaithful
or
why
should
he
leave
thee
the
sultaun
was
struck
by
the
remark
if
i
thought
so
he
said
quickly
why
should
he
for
months
have
been
collecting
his
money
continued
jaffar
every
rupee
he
could
collect
has
gone
to
hyderabad
bills
hoondees
gold
all
except
what
he
has
with
him
he
has
ground
the
uttermost
couree
from
those
who
owed
him
is
this
true
ay
by
your
head
shall
i
bring
the
sahoukars
who
gave
them
ya
alla
cried
the
sultaun
what
a
serpent
have
i
been
nourishing
thou
saidst
to
hyderabad
ay
he
will
go
to
sikundur
jah
and
fill
his
ears
with
tales
of
thee
for
the
english
and
give
them
a
plan
of
this
fort
was
he
not
always
with
the
engineers
enough
good
fellow
said
the
sultaun
sternly
he
must
not
reach
the
thou
understand
i
will
not
lose
a
moment
the
men
will
have
to
travel
fast
but
they
can
overtake
will
they
dare
attack
him
methinks
there
are
few
who
would
attempt
that
even
among
thy
there
are
some
of
them
who
would
attack
hell
itself
and
its
king
satan
said
the
man
with
a
grin
when
they
have
had
bhang
enough
trust
me
it
shall
be
done
he
escaped
me
once
said
jaffar
as
he
went
out
he
will
be
lucky
if
he
does
so
again
we
shall
be
even
at
kasim
ali
rode
on
gaily
with
him
were
a
number
of
men
who
had
previously
obtained
leave
of
absence
and
had
stayed
for
the
advantage
of
his
society
and
safe
conduct
for
he
was
respected
by
all
they
were
proceeding
some
on
horseback
others
on
ponies
to
various
parts
of
the
north
of
mysore
some
to
his
own
district
some
to
hyderabad
the
road
was
light
under
their
horses
feet
and
coss
after
coss
passed
almost
without
their
knowledge
as
they
conversed
freely
and
merrily
together
at
the
point
where
the
river
madoor
crosses
the
road
to
bangalore
there
is
a
good
deal
of
thick
jungle
but
they
heeded
not
the
pass
though
it
was
noted
for
robbers
they
were
too
formidable
a
party
to
be
attacked
as
they
proceeded
carelessly
a
shot
whistled
from
among
some
bushes
to
the
went
harmless
another
and
kasim
felt
a
sting
in
his
left
arm
and
he
saw
a
man
fall
upon
them
he
cried
drawing
his
sword
upon
the
sons
of
defiled
mothers
and
he
dashed
into
the
jungle
followed
by
the
best
mounted
ten
or
twelve
men
were
flying
at
their
utmost
they
had
a
poor
chance
before
those
determined
horsemen
kasim
cut
at
two
as
he
passed
them
they
were
not
killed
but
badly
wounded
three
others
were
despatched
i
know
that
rascal
s
face
said
one
of
his
companions
as
the
prisoners
were
brought
up
it
is
one
of
jaffar
s
ay
and
this
is
another
said
kasim
he
was
in
the
durbar
yesterday
tell
us
why
thou
hast
done
this
he
said
why
didst
thou
attack
me
what
have
i
ever
done
to
harm
thee
nothing
said
one
sullenly
it
was
the
sultaun
s
thou
liest
cried
kasim
striking
him
do
not
beat
me
he
replied
but
behold
here
is
the
order
to
give
us
horses
to
overtake
thee
shouldst
thou
have
gone
on
we
knew
not
that
thou
hadst
tarried
in
the
city
last
night
we
arose
and
came
on
to
the
last
village
they
told
us
there
thou
hadst
not
passed
and
we
waited
for
thee
behold
this
is
the
sultaun
s
it
was
truly
private
seal
kasim
well
knew
it
he
shuddered
as
he
looked
on
it
why
should
there
have
been
such
black
treachery
go
said
he
to
the
man
recollecting
himself
thou
are
but
the
instrument
of
others
alla
give
thee
a
better
heart
tell
thy
master
i
recognise
his
work
and
bid
him
say
to
the
sultaun
or
say
it
love
that
was
between
us
is
broken
for
ever
go
let
us
press
on
my
friends
said
kasim
not
by
the
road
but
by
though
i
know
not
what
vengeance
i
have
provoked
ye
see
i
am
not
they
did
so
and
it
was
well
that
they
travelled
fast
for
the
baffled
tiger
raved
at
the
loss
of
his
prey
and
many
men
pursued
kasim
and
his
companions
but
in
vain
chapter
xlvii
the
morning
of
the
of
april
was
a
scene
of
universal
excitement
in
the
fort
of
seringapatam
as
the
day
advanced
crowds
of
men
collected
in
the
great
square
before
the
palace
soldiers
in
their
gayest
costumes
horsemen
and
caparisoned
elephants
which
always
waited
upon
the
sultaun
and
his
officers
the
roofs
of
the
houses
around
those
of
the
palace
particularly
the
old
temples
and
the
flat
terraces
of
its
courts
and
dhurrumsalas
even
the
trees
were
crowded
with
human
beings
on
the
gay
colours
of
whose
dresses
a
brighter
sun
had
never
shone
there
arose
from
the
mighty
mass
of
garrulous
beings
a
vast
hubbub
of
sounds
increased
by
the
sultaun
s
loud
the
martial
music
of
the
band
of
a
french
regiment
the
shrill
blasts
of
the
collery
horns
neighings
of
horses
and
trumpetings
of
elephants
as
they
were
urged
hither
and
thither
no
one
in
this
land
can
have
an
idea
of
the
gorgeous
appearance
of
these
spectacles
for
an
eastern
crowd
from
the
endless
variety
of
its
bright
colours
and
the
picturesqueness
and
grace
of
its
costumes
gaily
caparisoned
horses
elephants
and
camels
of
all
others
in
the
world
the
most
beautiful
and
impressive
in
the
centre
of
the
square
was
an
open
space
kept
by
french
soldiers
in
the
middle
of
this
stood
a
small
tree
which
had
been
uprooted
and
planted
there
but
already
its
leaves
had
faded
and
drooped
it
was
covered
with
gay
ribbons
of
all
colours
and
of
gold
and
silver
tissue
which
fluttered
in
the
fresh
breeze
and
glittered
in
the
sun
this
was
surmounted
by
a
spear
on
which
was
the
red
cap
of
liberty
the
fearful
emblem
of
the
french
revolution
around
it
were
many
french
officers
some
dressed
fantastically
and
crowned
with
wreaths
of
green
leaves
others
in
brilliant
uniforms
their
plumes
and
feathers
waving
many
of
them
spoke
with
excited
gestures
from
time
to
time
and
swore
round
oaths
at
the
sultaun
s
delay
for
the
sun
had
climbed
high
into
the
heaven
and
no
shade
was
there
to
save
them
from
its
now
scorching
beams
the
amicable
issue
of
the
embassy
to
paris
sent
by
tippoo
in
had
been
exaggerated
by
the
envoys
to
enhance
their
consequence
and
the
french
officers
in
his
service
had
by
every
possible
means
in
their
power
kept
this
feeling
alive
when
the
revolution
broke
out
the
roar
of
which
faintly
reached
the
sultaun
of
mysore
it
was
represented
to
him
by
those
of
the
french
nation
who
were
there
in
such
terms
of
extravagant
eulogium
while
its
bloody
cruelties
were
concealed
or
if
mentioned
declared
to
be
acts
of
retributive
justice
that
the
sultaun
s
mind
itself
a
restless
chaos
of
crude
ideas
of
perpetual
changes
and
progression
eagerly
caught
at
the
frenzied
notions
of
liberty
which
the
frenchmen
preached
at
the
same
time
it
is
almost
impossible
to
conceive
how
an
asiatic
monarch
born
to
despotism
could
have
endured
such
an
anomaly
as
his
position
who
with
the
most
petty
jealousy
and
suspicion
resisted
any
restriction
of
or
interference
with
his
absolute
will
and
direction
of
all
affairs
even
to
the
most
minute
and
unimportant
of
his
government
whether
civil
or
military
from
time
to
time
allured
by
the
certainty
of
good
pay
in
his
army
many
needy
adventurers
came
to
him
from
the
isle
of
france
who
were
entertained
at
once
and
assumed
if
they
did
not
possess
it
a
knowledge
of
military
affairs
these
kept
up
a
constant
correspondence
with
their
parent
country
and
willing
to
humour
the
sultaun
while
indulging
their
own
spleen
they
poured
into
his
ready
ear
the
most
virulent
abuse
of
the
english
and
constant
false
statements
of
their
losses
by
sea
and
land
while
the
accounts
of
french
superiority
and
french
victory
were
related
in
tones
of
exaggerated
triumph
ripaud
an
adventurer
with
more
pretension
and
address
than
others
having
arrived
at
mangalore
and
discerning
the
bent
of
the
court
from
tippoo
s
authorities
there
represented
himself
to
be
an
envoy
from
the
french
republic
and
was
invited
at
once
to
the
capital
it
may
well
be
supposed
that
he
did
not
underrate
his
own
assumed
influence
nor
the
immense
advantages
of
an
embassy
in
return
and
one
was
sent
by
tippoo
which
meeting
with
various
adventures
by
the
way
returned
at
last
not
with
the
mighty
force
he
had
been
led
to
expect
but
with
a
few
needy
officers
the
chief
of
whom
was
chapuis
men
who
determined
to
raise
for
themselves
at
his
court
a
power
equal
to
that
of
perron
at
the
court
of
sindia
and
of
raymond
at
that
of
the
nizam
this
was
a
feverish
period
for
india
when
those
two
mighty
nations
england
and
france
were
striving
for
supremacy
true
the
power
of
the
english
was
immeasurably
more
concentrated
and
effective
and
their
resolute
and
steady
valour
more
highly
appreciated
than
the
brilliant
but
eccentric
character
of
the
french
still
however
the
latter
power
had
increased
extraordinarily
since
the
last
war
with
tippoo
and
men
at
sindia
s
court
over
whom
perron
held
absolute
sway
and
under
raymond
at
hyderabad
were
pledged
by
their
leaders
to
aggrandize
the
power
of
their
nation
and
to
disseminate
the
principles
of
the
revolution
chapuis
had
laboured
hard
to
effect
his
object
a
man
of
talent
and
he
had
at
once
assumed
a
mental
superiority
over
the
sultaun
which
he
maintained
he
had
flattered
cajoled
and
threatened
by
turns
he
had
written
to
the
french
government
in
his
had
promised
unlimited
supplies
of
men
and
had
bewildered
the
sultaun
s
mind
with
the
sophistries
of
the
revolution
with
vague
notions
of
liberty
equality
and
the
happiness
which
was
to
follow
upon
the
earth
from
the
adoption
of
these
principles
by
all
had
told
him
of
the
rapid
rise
of
buonaparte
of
his
magnificent
victories
and
inflamed
him
with
visions
of
conquest
even
more
vast
than
those
of
the
french
general
the
french
expedition
to
egypt
became
known
their
successes
and
their
subjugation
of
the
country
that
seemed
but
the
to
greater
achievements
alexander
with
a
few
greeks
had
penetrated
into
india
and
had
subdued
all
in
his
path
buonaparte
with
his
victorious
armies
far
outnumbering
the
greeks
was
at
a
point
from
whence
he
could
make
an
immediate
descent
upon
bombay
then
would
perron
lead
sindia
into
his
the
nizam
the
mahrattas
a
wavering
power
would
side
with
the
strongest
zeman
shah
and
his
hardy
afghans
had
already
promised
so
had
the
rajpoots
and
the
men
of
delhi
and
those
of
nipal
last
of
all
tippoo
himself
who
had
already
met
and
defeated
the
english
in
the
field
all
were
to
join
in
one
crusade
against
the
infidel
the
detested
english
and
expel
them
for
ever
from
india
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
wild
and
restless
ambition
of
the
sultaun
was
excited
his
intrigues
more
and
more
frequent
and
as
success
seemingly
lay
within
his
grasp
that
he
himself
was
more
open
and
unguarded
join
but
our
society
chapuis
would
say
to
him
you
league
yourself
with
us
identify
yourself
with
the
french
republic
interests
become
yours
welfare
its
most
anxious
care
you
become
the
friend
the
brother
of
buonaparte
and
at
once
attach
him
to
you
by
a
bond
which
no
vicissitudes
can
and
he
yielded
though
with
dread
for
he
knew
not
the
meaning
of
the
wild
ceremony
they
proposed
of
destroying
the
symbols
of
royalty
and
reducing
himself
to
a
level
with
the
meanest
of
his
subjects
it
was
a
thing
abhorrent
to
his
nature
one
which
he
dared
not
disclose
even
to
his
intimates
but
to
which
he
yielded
drawn
on
by
the
blindest
ambition
that
ever
urged
a
human
being
to
destruction
the
frenchmen
had
long
waited
at
length
there
arose
a
shout
and
the
and
loud
nagaras
from
the
palace
proclaimed
that
the
sultaun
was
advancing
he
approached
slowly
dressed
in
the
plainest
clothes
no
jewel
was
in
his
turban
only
his
rosary
around
his
neck
a
string
of
pearls
without
a
price
for
each
bead
had
been
exchanged
for
another
when
one
more
valuable
could
be
purchased
a
lane
was
formed
through
the
crowd
and
his
slaves
headed
by
jaffar
his
confidential
officer
preceded
him
forcing
the
people
back
by
rude
blows
of
their
sheathed
sabres
and
shouting
his
titles
in
extravagant
terms
all
hailed
the
spectacle
as
one
to
exult
in
though
they
could
not
understand
it
but
to
the
sultaun
it
was
one
of
bitter
humiliation
his
feelings
at
which
he
could
hardly
repress
he
passed
on
the
crowd
making
reverence
to
him
as
he
moved
he
did
not
return
their
salutation
his
eyes
were
downcast
and
he
bit
his
lips
almost
till
the
blood
came
before
him
was
the
place
where
he
was
going
to
a
moral
abjure
his
power
over
allow
himself
to
be
on
equality
with
the
meanest
to
hold
authority
over
them
not
of
inherent
right
but
by
their
sufferance
had
any
one
known
his
intention
and
spoken
one
word
to
him
in
remonstrance
he
would
have
turned
but
the
men
were
before
him
to
whom
he
had
sworn
obedience
and
he
proceeded
chapuis
advanced
he
saw
his
agitation
and
in
a
few
hurried
words
implored
him
to
be
firm
reminding
him
of
the
issue
at
stake
and
this
rallied
him
he
led
him
to
the
tree
there
was
an
altar
beneath
as
if
for
sacrifice
a
small
fire
burned
on
it
and
its
thin
blue
smoke
rose
among
the
branches
and
melted
away
into
air
a
perfume
was
thrown
from
time
to
time
into
the
flame
which
spread
itself
abroad
as
the
smoke
was
dissipated
chapuis
and
some
others
officiated
as
priests
of
the
mysteries
and
they
knelt
before
the
altar
while
one
made
a
passionate
invocation
to
liberty
which
another
tried
in
vain
to
explain
to
the
sultaun
it
was
finished
they
arose
and
chapuis
advanced
toward
him
hast
thou
the
emblems
he
said
the
sultaun
took
them
from
an
attendant
the
feather
of
gold
tinsel
he
always
wore
in
his
turban
and
an
ornament
of
trifling
value
for
the
head
these
are
all
he
said
be
they
will
be
nothing
without
your
highness
s
own
turban
replied
chapuis
placed
in
that
your
people
will
understand
the
ceremony
otherwise
it
is
vain
your
highness
remembers
your
promise
and
mine
i
have
performed
mine
see
that
thou
o
sultaun
dost
not
fail
the
others
echoed
his
words
and
urged
the
sultaun
to
obey
hesitating
and
almost
trembling
he
did
so
they
will
not
understand
he
said
to
himself
they
can
not
comprehend
this
mummery
they
can
not
hear
what
the
frenchmen
say
much
less
understand
their
broken
he
took
the
turban
from
his
brows
and
gave
it
into
chapuis
hand
the
officer
placed
in
it
the
tinsel
feather
and
threw
it
contemptuously
into
the
fire
an
attendant
raised
and
unfurled
a
scarlet
chuttree
or
umbrella
over
the
monarch
s
head
that
too
was
remarked
it
must
follow
said
chapuis
to
him
that
is
a
regal
emblem
must
be
none
left
of
the
he
caught
it
from
the
attendant
and
flung
it
on
the
fire
there
arose
a
deep
murmur
of
indignation
from
the
multitude
to
see
their
monarch
s
turban
taken
from
his
head
and
burned
to
see
his
chuttree
forcibly
taken
and
destroyed
was
more
than
they
could
bear
without
an
expression
of
excitement
and
cries
of
indignation
rent
the
air
to
hell
with
the
feringhees
them
down
impiety
is
this
what
insult
to
the
sultaun
and
many
drew
their
swords
and
raised
them
on
high
to
strike
the
frenchmen
were
in
imminent
peril
but
they
were
firm
it
was
a
grand
and
striking
excited
fierce
those
hoarse
shouts
and
threats
in
the
centre
the
group
on
which
all
eyes
were
fixed
the
sultaun
and
those
few
needy
adventurers
reckless
and
unprincipled
who
had
gained
a
mastery
over
one
whose
smallest
gesture
would
have
caused
their
instant
annihilation
peace
he
cried
raising
his
arm
it
is
our
is
the
multitude
was
hushed
but
many
a
muttered
threat
was
spoken
many
a
prayer
for
the
dire
omen
to
be
averted
many
an
expression
of
pity
for
the
position
of
one
whom
all
feared
and
many
even
venerated
and
truly
to
see
that
degradation
done
to
one
who
knew
not
its
meaning
who
bareheaded
before
his
people
and
under
a
fierce
sun
stood
and
looked
on
at
the
destruction
of
the
emblems
of
his
have
caused
pity
for
his
condition
but
it
did
not
in
those
who
stood
around
him
the
act
sealed
their
own
had
no
thought
of
pity
as
the
last
fragments
burned
to
ashes
in
the
blaze
of
the
fire
chapuis
lowered
the
spear
on
which
was
the
cap
and
presented
it
to
the
monarch
wear
it
he
said
consecrated
as
it
is
in
the
smoke
of
those
emblems
which
are
destroyed
for
ever
wear
earnest
of
the
victories
thou
wilt
the
sultaun
put
it
on
chapuis
seized
a
flag
which
an
officer
bore
near
him
and
waved
it
above
his
head
it
was
the
signal
agreed
on
the
artillerymen
were
at
their
posts
on
the
ramparts
and
the
roar
of
two
thousand
and
three
hundred
cannon
proclaimed
that
tippoo
the
light
of
the
faith
the
lion
of
islam
the
sultaun
of
mysore
was
now
citizen
tippoo
of
the
french
republic
one
and
indivisible
then
followed
the
coarse
salutations
of
the
french
soldiery
who
excited
by
liquor
and
by
the
event
rushed
around
the
sultaun
and
seized
his
hand
shaking
it
in
rude
familiarity
his
cup
of
humiliation
was
full
and
he
returned
to
his
palace
in
bitter
mortification
and
anger
there
were
many
of
his
officers
who
deeply
touched
by
the
mockery
of
the
exhibition
remonstrated
with
him
and
advised
him
to
revoke
the
act
by
a
solemn
scene
in
the
mosque
attended
by
all
his
army
and
the
high
religious
functionaries
but
it
was
impossible
to
arouse
him
to
the
shake
off
the
domination
to
which
he
had
subjected
himself
and
while
it
was
whispered
abroad
that
the
sultaun
had
become
a
feringhee
those
who
wished
well
to
his
cause
saw
that
he
had
with
his
own
hands
struck
a
vital
blow
at
its
interests
it
was
happy
for
the
british
cause
in
india
that
a
nobleman
was
appointed
to
the
responsible
station
of
who
from
the
moment
he
undertook
the
office
and
during
his
passage
out
to
india
bent
his
whole
mind
to
the
complete
investigation
of
the
politics
of
the
country
he
came
to
govern
he
was
happy
in
having
those
with
him
who
could
afford
him
an
insight
into
the
designs
and
wishes
of
the
native
princes
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
lord
mornington
resolved
to
act
upon
many
suggestions
he
received
even
before
he
arrived
to
the
intrigues
of
the
sultaun
his
notice
had
been
particularly
attracted
and
the
designs
of
the
french
were
too
obvious
to
be
unnoticed
for
a
moment
by
a
chain
of
events
which
are
points
of
history
the
sultaun
s
intrigues
with
the
french
government
of
the
mauritius
became
known
the
proclamations
of
its
governor
were
received
at
calcutta
and
though
doubted
at
first
from
the
continued
expressions
of
friendship
made
by
the
sultaun
yet
their
authenticity
was
established
beyond
a
doubt
by
subsequent
inquiries
after
the
scene
in
the
fort
which
we
have
mentioned
tippoo
abandoned
himself
to
the
councils
of
his
french
officers
he
was
admitted
by
them
as
a
proof
of
brotherhood
to
a
participation
in
the
secrets
of
the
correspondence
held
between
chapuis
raymond
and
perron
buonaparte
was
successful
in
egypt
and
it
was
debated
only
when
the
time
should
be
fixed
for
the
army
of
tippoo
to
be
set
in
motion
and
to
overwhelm
madras
the
army
itself
was
full
of
confidence
and
great
attention
had
been
paid
to
its
discipline
by
the
french
all
branches
were
more
perfectly
efficient
than
they
had
ever
been
the
sultaun
had
now
no
apprehension
about
the
fort
for
he
had
been
surrounding
it
with
another
wall
and
ditch
and
the
gates
had
been
strengthened
by
outworks
there
never
was
a
time
when
all
his
prospects
were
so
bright
when
the
political
condition
of
india
suggested
all
the
native
princes
by
one
exertion
on
his
part
might
be
incited
to
make
common
cause
against
the
english
and
when
by
the
proposed
expedition
against
manilla
the
british
forces
would
be
much
reduced
both
at
madras
and
in
bengal
it
was
at
this
hazardous
moment
that
the
genius
of
lord
mornington
guided
by
the
sound
views
of
the
political
agents
at
the
various
courts
decided
upon
the
line
of
action
to
be
pursued
the
french
interest
in
india
was
to
be
annihilated
at
all
hazards
therefore
after
a
preparatory
treaty
with
the
nizam
an
english
force
by
rapid
marches
arrived
at
hyderabad
and
joining
the
subsidiary
force
there
surrounded
the
french
camp
which
was
found
to
be
in
a
state
of
previous
mutiny
against
its
officers
the
whole
submitted
and
a
blow
moral
as
well
as
physical
was
struck
against
the
french
influence
from
which
it
never
recovered
the
effect
of
this
news
at
seringaptam
may
be
imagined
and
when
it
was
followed
up
by
that
of
the
glorious
victory
of
nelson
at
the
mouth
of
the
nile
the
sultaun
s
spirit
fell
it
was
in
vain
that
he
wrote
apparently
sincere
letters
to
the
and
at
the
same
moment
dispatched
of
treasure
to
sindia
to
urge
him
to
move
southwards
the
one
estimated
the
true
worth
of
the
correspondence
and
the
wily
mahratta
though
he
took
the
money
yet
stirred
not
a
foot
he
had
too
much
at
stake
to
be
led
into
a
quarrel
of
which
he
could
not
see
any
probable
termination
tippoo
s
ambassadors
at
the
courts
of
sindia
and
holkar
of
the
peshwa
of
the
rajah
of
berar
all
wrote
word
that
these
potentates
would
join
the
cause
but
their
letters
were
cold
and
wary
and
the
sultaun
discovered
too
late
that
he
must
abide
the
brunt
of
the
blow
himself
his
dread
of
the
english
was
vented
daily
in
his
durbar
in
compositions
the
most
abominable
that
his
fertile
brain
could
invent
besides
his
pretended
supernatural
revelations
letters
were
read
purporting
to
be
from
delhi
from
calcutta
from
lucknow
describing
the
atrocious
conduct
of
the
english
the
forced
conversion
of
mahommedans
to
christianity
the
violation
of
females
of
rank
by
the
soldiery
the
plunder
and
sack
of
towns
given
up
to
rapine
and
after
reading
them
tippoo
would
give
vent
to
frantic
prayers
that
judgment
might
come
upon
them
in
this
however
as
in
many
other
instances
he
overreached
the
mark
he
aimed
at
a
few
of
the
flatterers
around
him
at
every
succeeding
story
swore
to
spread
it
abroad
and
while
they
applauded
pretended
to
feel
excitement
but
they
ridiculed
them
in
secret
and
they
were
soon
listened
to
except
by
the
most
bigoted
with
contempt
thus
passed
the
whole
of
a
year
of
anxious
suspense
to
the
british
in
india
when
their
power
rested
in
a
balance
which
a
hair
might
have
turned
during
this
period
the
mind
of
tippoo
presents
a
humiliating
spectacle
now
raving
for
conquest
now
sunk
in
despair
and
dread
at
the
slow
but
certain
preparations
of
the
times
prosecuting
with
all
the
bigotry
and
savageness
of
his
nature
conversions
of
the
hindoos
in
various
parts
of
his
dominions
and
at
others
bowing
down
in
slavish
obedience
to
the
dictates
of
the
brahmins
and
offering
up
in
the
temples
of
the
fort
sacrifices
in
secret
for
the
discomfiture
of
his
enemies
while
in
the
retired
apartments
of
the
palace
magical
rites
were
orgies
at
which
he
himself
assisted
to
relate
which
as
we
have
heard
them
told
would
be
to
defile
our
pages
with
obscenities
too
gross
to
be
repeated
in
the
midst
of
this
mental
darkness
there
would
break
out
gleams
of
kindly
feeling
towards
his
sons
his
officers
oftentimes
to
a
sick
servant
and
upon
the
lady
fureeda
he
lavished
such
love
as
his
heart
cold
by
nature
possessed
and
whom
his
secret
sufferings
absolute
prostration
of
intellect
at
times
when
fresh
disastrous
news
reached
him
would
inspire
with
a
compassion
she
would
fain
have
expressed
in
words
in
those
consolings
which
to
a
fond
and
wounded
spirit
are
acceptable
and
bearable
only
from
a
woman
there
was
another
on
whom
his
memory
rested
and
whom
he
besought
now
by
threats
now
by
immense
rewards
to
join
his
was
herbert
compton
his
existence
was
known
only
to
jaffar
and
the
sultaun
the
latter
had
during
the
lapse
of
years
and
while
the
repairs
of
his
fort
proceeded
offered
him
rank
power
women
all
that
his
imagination
could
suggest
to
dazzle
a
young
man
but
in
vain
he
had
threatened
him
with
death
but
this
was
equally
vain
herbert
had
looked
on
death
too
long
to
fear
it
and
despite
of
the
climate
the
weary
life
he
led
had
grown
almost
insupportable
and
he
saw
no
relief
from
it
death
would
have
been
welcome
to
him
but
he
was
suffered
to
live
on
even
the
visits
of
jaffar
were
events
which
however
trying
to
him
at
the
time
and
exciting
to
one
so
secluded
were
yet
looked
back
upon
with
pleasure
from
the
very
thought
they
created
sometimes
the
sultaun
would
relent
towards
him
and
seem
on
the
point
of
releasing
him
and
others
but
the
shame
of
the
act
the
indignant
remonstrance
that
he
dreaded
from
the
british
and
the
advice
of
jaffar
himself
deterred
him
thus
the
poor
fellow
lingered
on
almost
without
hope
or
fear
and
in
the
end
amidst
other
more
stirring
and
anxious
matters
his
existence
was
almost
forgotten
how
often
too
would
tippoo
s
thoughts
revert
to
kasim
ali
his
conduct
to
whom
in
spite
of
the
treachery
denounced
by
jaffar
would
sometimes
rise
up
in
judgment
against
his
conscience
to
do
him
justice
however
it
should
be
mentioned
that
when
the
emissaries
of
jaffar
returned
foiled
and
with
kasim
s
message
he
did
make
inquiries
in
the
bazaars
relative
to
the
money
which
jaffar
had
told
him
kasim
ali
had
remitted
to
hyderabad
and
he
found
all
his
statements
so
completely
established
that
they
confirmed
in
his
mind
at
the
time
the
conviction
that
kasim
had
been
false
to
him
and
that
his
falsehood
had
been
long
meditated
and
at
last
successfully
executed
but
this
wore
off
at
length
and
for
one
so
esteemed
nay
loved
there
remained
a
painful
impression
that
injustice
had
been
done
to
say
the
truth
when
all
around
him
were
suspected
the
flatterers
and
courtiers
from
their
habitual
subserviency
and
his
elder
and
more
trusted
officers
from
their
blunt
advice
and
open
condemnation
of
many
of
his
schemes
and
proceedings
he
often
longed
for
the
presence
of
the
young
patél
who
would
in
his
own
person
have
united
the
qualities
he
most
affection
joined
to
a
mild
demeanour
and
an
honest
heart
early
in
it
was
impossible
to
disguise
from
himself
that
the
time
had
come
when
he
should
either
make
resistance
against
the
english
his
attack
upon
madras
had
long
been
abandoned
as
impracticable
even
by
the
he
should
march
forth
at
the
head
of
his
army
and
oppose
them
he
determined
on
the
latter
course
and
leaving
his
trusty
commanders
syud
sahib
and
poornea
in
charge
of
the
fort
he
marched
on
a
day
when
his
astrologers
and
his
own
calculations
of
lucky
and
unlucky
days
promised
an
uninterrupted
career
of
prosperity
and
victory
to
meet
the
bombay
army
which
was
approaching
through
coorg
at
the
head
of
fifty
thousand
men
the
flower
of
his
troops
once
in
the
field
his
ancient
vigour
and
courage
revived
his
army
was
in
the
highest
efficiency
the
bombay
force
he
knew
could
not
be
a
fifth
of
his
own
and
by
selecting
his
own
ground
which
he
should
be
enabled
to
do
he
might
practise
the
same
manœuvre
as
he
had
done
at
perambaukum
with
baillie
and
by
drawing
them
into
an
ambuscade
destroy
them
his
low
estimation
however
of
the
english
was
fated
to
be
corrected
and
though
at
sedaseer
where
he
met
the
bombay
army
he
led
in
person
several
desperate
charges
upon
the
british
and
though
under
his
eye
his
troops
fought
well
and
were
driven
back
with
loss
only
to
advance
again
and
again
in
a
series
of
desperate
onsets
for
five
hours
yet
he
was
defeated
losing
all
presence
of
mind
and
confidence
in
his
army
although
there
was
every
chance
of
success
had
he
persevered
in
his
attacks
on
stuart
s
corps
he
retreated
from
the
scene
of
action
upon
the
capital
to
draw
from
thence
fresh
troops
with
which
he
might
oppose
the
march
of
the
grand
army
from
the
east
and
now
began
that
gloomy
thought
for
the
future
that
utter
despair
of
his
life
which
continued
to
the
last
chequered
only
by
fits
of
the
wildest
excitement
by
blind
reliance
at
times
upon
vain
rites
and
ceremonies
and
forced
hilarity
which
the
effect
of
despair
was
even
more
fearful
to
behold
the
great
drama
of
his
fate
was
rapidly
drawing
to
a
gorgeous
spectacle
with
mighty
men
and
armies
for
actors
and
the
people
of
india
for
spectators
chapter
xlviii
the
morning
of
the
of
march
broke
with
unclouded
splendour
the
army
of
the
sultaun
were
expecting
their
enemies
with
impatience
and
the
result
was
looked
to
with
confidence
tippoo
had
been
urged
by
chapuis
to
take
up
a
position
upon
the
madoor
in
the
same
pass
as
that
where
kasim
ali
had
been
attacked
but
the
frenchmen
had
lost
very
considerably
the
influence
they
possessed
since
the
news
of
their
defeat
in
egypt
and
the
discomfiture
of
raymond
at
hyderabad
and
he
determined
to
pursue
the
bent
of
his
own
inclination
both
as
to
the
ground
he
should
select
and
the
disposition
of
his
troops
since
daylight
he
had
been
on
horseback
indefatigable
in
marshalling
his
army
the
ground
he
had
selected
was
commanding
and
covered
the
road
malvilly
he
knew
was
the
destination
of
the
english
on
that
day
and
as
it
was
one
marked
by
a
particularly
auspicious
conjunction
of
the
planets
he
determined
on
trying
the
result
of
a
general
action
when
a
few
attempted
to
dissuade
him
that
morning
from
opposing
the
english
lest
by
a
defeat
he
should
dispirit
his
troops
and
unfit
them
for
the
siege
which
all
felt
sure
must
follow
he
flew
into
a
violent
passion
are
we
cowards
he
said
that
we
should
retire
before
the
kafirs
and
cowardly
english
no
let
them
come
rascals
let
them
come
on
and
taste
of
death
if
our
his
name
be
ever
honoured
overwhelm
the
english
in
the
field
should
we
not
follow
so
exalted
an
example
no
by
the
prophet
we
will
not
retire
the
day
is
planets
are
in
good
conjunction
if
ye
are
cowards
and
like
not
the
english
your
absence
is
better
than
your
but
all
swore
to
fight
to
the
last
drop
of
blood
and
the
sultaun
s
disposition
was
made
soon
after
sunrise
all
were
at
their
heavy
guns
in
the
centre
the
infantry
behind
two
corps
one
of
them
the
favourite
kureem
cushoon
were
pushed
forward
upon
the
flanks
and
hundreds
of
were
interspersed
with
the
line
it
was
a
gallant
and
inspiring
sight
to
see
that
huge
force
drawn
up
in
steady
array
determined
upon
retrieving
their
fame
that
day
and
fighting
for
islam
and
for
their
sultaun
they
had
waited
long
the
sultaun
had
heard
from
scouts
that
the
english
had
left
their
camp
long
before
dawn
and
their
coming
was
looked
for
with
eagerness
they
will
fly
he
cried
when
they
see
the
array
the
sons
of
dogs
and
swine
will
not
dare
to
face
the
true
yes
said
nedeem

who
were
always
near
him
it
will
be
as
my
lord
says
we
shall
have
no
fighting
will
they
dare
to
advance
against
these
cannon
and
the
various
divisions
which
are
drawn
up
in
such
wonderful
order
that
not
even
a
rat
could
get
between

but
what
is
that
yonder
tis
they

they
cried
the
sultaun
now
upon
them
my
sons
upon
them
and
let
us
see
ye
do
brave
deeds
your
sultaun
is
beholding
you
it
was
indeed
a
beautiful
sight
to
behold
the
sultaun
was
on
a
high
ground
and
could
see
all
a
few
english
were
first
more
the
sun
glanced
from
their
bright
bayonets
and
as
they
proceeded
gradually
column
after
column
came
on
though
they
were
still
at
some
distance
there
was
a
halt
perceived
and
considerable
bustle
they
retreat
they
retreat
cried
the
sultaun
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
clapping
his
hands
and
laughing
in
his
excitement
it
was
changed
in
an
instant
when
after
a
short
disposition
of
the
troops
the
english
army
advanced
but
it
appeared
such
a
mere
handful
of
men
when
compared
with
his
own
force
that
his
derision
grew
even
louder
ha
ha
he
cried
they
have
left
half
their
army
to
keep
their
baggage
they
hold
me
cheap
indeed
to
attempt
to
attack
me
with
the
few
that
are
yonder
but
it
is
well
inshalla
ye
will
see
sirs
ye
will
see
what
troops
are
those
on
the
left
he
asked
after
a
while
as
he
examined
them
with
a
telescope
what
green
standard
is
that
dare
the
infidels
to
use
the
sacred
colour
just
then
the
breeze
unfurled
the
standard
to
its
full
width
and
as
all
descried
the
white
crescent
and
ball
beneath
it
a
cry
of
exultation
burst
from
the
sultaun
tis
the
standard
of
sikundur
jah
tis
effeminate
dekhanees
who
are
no
better
than
eunuchs
advancing
upon

inshalla
let
them
come
the
renegades
from
the
faith
advancing
against
the
favoured
of
the
prophet
holy
mohamed
confound
them
the
english
army
halted
its
long
columns
deployed
into
lines
steadily
and
gracefully
it
was
a
beautiful
sight
in
that
bright
sun
there
was
a
large
opening
in
the
line
and
tippoo
rode
forward
urging
his
cavalry
to
break
through
and
attack
the
general
who
with
his
staff
was
beyond
ah
had
i
kasim
ali
and
my
brave
old
rhyman
khan
now
they
would
shame

cried
to
those
who
he
fancied
were
tardy
in
movement
but
they
did
their
charged
steady
men
cried
the
officer
at
the
head
of
the

come
the
cavalry
thundered
grand
picturesque
their
cries
of
deen
deen
and
alla
yar
the
english
were
not
to
be
daunted
they
were
steady
as
rocks
and
awaited
the
word
the
effect
was
deadly
as
the
smoke
cleared
away
the
flying
mass
was
seen
in
wild
confusion
and
before
the
line
a
heap
of
men
and
horses
struggling
a
few
daring
fellows
had
however
dashed
through
the
interval
and
fell
gallantly
fighting
in
the
rear
meanwhile
the
sultaun
s
infantry
advanced
steadily
and
firmly
he
cheered
them
on
putting
himself
at
their
head
even
within
shot
and
then
he
turned
to
watch
his
favourite
division
it
was
composed
of
picked
men
their
arms
dress
discipline
were
all
superior
to
the
rest
of
the
army
they
were
advancing
against
the
nizam
s
troops
and
were
confident
of
victory
the
sultaun
was
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
little
imagined
he
then
to
whom
he
was
opposed
that
one
led
the
troops
which
he
expected
would
fly
like
dust
before
the
whirlwind
to
whom
fear
was
bore
within
him
the
germ
of
that
renown
which
has
raised
him
to
the
proudest
the
most
glorious
pinnacle
of
heroic
wellington
what
heart
so
callous
that
does
not
bound
at
those
illustrious
names
recalling
with
them
victories
upon
victories
to
his
the
result
of
fortuitous
circumstances
but
of
devoted
bravery
of
admirable
foresight
of
consummate
skill
of
patience
and
fortitude
under
every
privation
through
a
long
series
of
most
splendid
array
of
triumph
that
ever
the
world
beheld
which
already
so
glorious
will
yet
increase
in
after
times
to
a
renown
more
brilliant
than

with
excitement
and
anxiety
on

and
in
an
instant
became
a
confused
rabble
flying
for
their
lives
in
the
midst
of
whom
were
the
english
cavalry
riding
down
the
fugitives
while
they
cut
at
them
with
their
long
swords
the
sultaun
gazed
breathless
and
stupefied
for
a
few
moments
no
one
dared
to
speak
at
last
he
turned
his
face
wore
a
ghastly
expression
of
horror
at
which
his
attendants
shuddered
for
an
instant
he
looked
back
the
cavalry
thundered
portions
of
his
troops
were
giving
way
before
them
he
could
look
no
more
but
dashing
his
heels
into
the
flanks
of
his
charger
fled
from
the
field
shabash
shabash
well
done
gallant
fellow
cried
many
english
officers
surrounding
a
native
apparently
of
rank
who
clad
in
a
magnificent
suit
of
over
a
vest
with
a
bright
steel
cap
on
his
head
and
upon
a
noble
chesnut
horse
now
rode
up
at
full
gallop
accompanied
by
many
of
his
risala
as
martial
in
appearance
as
himself
and
equally
well
mounted
their
swords
were
red
with
blood
and
their
faces
flushed
and
excited
with
conquest

earned
the
of
the
general

his

but
now
i
am
free
of
thou

and
thou
wilt
see
how
grateful
an
english
commander
can
be
come
that
night
kasim
philip
dalton
and
many
others
were
in
the
general
s
tent
they
had
been
asking
him
about
the
road
he
seemed
to
think
a
while
will
ye
take
my
advice
he
asked
the
advice
of
one
who
is
not
worthy
to
give
it
say
on
replied
the
general
abandon
this
road
then
said
kasim
there
is
a
ford
at
sosillay
two
easy
marches
from
hence
it
is
deep
but
the
water
is
now
low
and
it
will
be
practicable
i
will
guide
you
to
it
if
you
will
trust
me
you
will
cross
the
river
is
plentiful
the
other
bank
is
clear
of
troops
and
ye

true
said
the
general
by
your
head
and
your
salt
it
is
will

one

for
you
it
is
a
fearful
kasim
looked
round
his
eyes
met
philip
s
come
he
said

a
ride

this
night
and
i
will

and
my
men

escort

trust
me
to
the
death
said
philip
i
believe
him
said
the
general
and
he
will
see
that
this
great
service
shall
be
rewarded
nevertheless
i
should
like
to
know
more
about
the
ford
and
if
it
can
be
reconnoitered
will
you
make
the
report
colonel
you
can
take
an
escort
of
with
pleasure
you
shall
know
early
and
i
will
accompany
you
said
another
officer
it
will
be
a
pleasant
come
gentlemen
said
kasim
we
lose
time
and
we
have
a
long
ride
before
the
sultaun
plunged
into
despair
had
retired
westward
the
army
had
collected
but
thousands
were
missing
killed
or
had
deserted
from
his
standard
still
there
was
hope
his
officers
were
yet
faithful
the
forage
of
the
north
bank
of
the
cavery
was
utterly
destroyed
and
the
active
poornea
at
the
head
of
the
irregular
cavalry
was
out
burning
villages
and
setting
fire
to
the
grass
of
the
wide
plains
if
the
english
should
advance
they
would
be
drawn
on
to
defeat
as
before
there
was
still
hope
his
plans
of
defence
were
being
matured
troops
poured
into
the
fort
from
all
sides
and
provisions
for
a
year
he
had
treasure
too
and
there
was
no
fear
what
could
the
english
with
their
small
amount
of
artillery
effect
against
the
hundreds
of
cannon
in
the
fort
and
the
new
fortifications
let
them
come
on
he
would
say
with
that
fort
before
and
a
bare
country
behind
them
let
us
see
how
long
they
will
stay
and
his
words
were
echoed
by
his
sycophants
but
it
was
easy
to
see
for
all
that
how
dread
gnawed
at
his
heart
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day
after
the
action
he
was
in
his
tent
of
audience
he
was
confident
for
no
news
had
been
heard
of
the
english
army
and
it
had
not
advanced
upon
the
road
as
he
had
expected
he
hoped
it
had
retreated
or
was
stationary
for
want
of
forage
and
he
was
even
asserting
broadly
that
it
had
suddenly
a
messenger
entered
with
dismay
upon
his
face
tippoo
knew
not
what
to
think
all
his
officers
were
present
and
every
one
trembled
though
they
knew
not
what
to
expect
speak
cried
tippoo
fiercely
what
hast
thou
to
say
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
may
i
be
pardoned
stammered
the
man
the
crossed
the
river
crossed
the
river
echoed
all
how
where
dog
cried
the
sultaun
if
thou
liest
i
will
have
thee
torn
asunder
where
did
they
cross
at
at
sosillay
who
has
been
the
traitor
is
any
one
missing
may
i
be
your
sacrifice
said
an
officer
it
must
be
kasim
ali
patél
he
was
seen
hewing
down
the
true
believers
at
kasim
ali
gasped
the
sultaun
alla
help
me
then
all
is
and
he
sank
down
on
his
musnud
in
stupor
long
he
remained
so
only
at
times
repeating
kasim
ali
and
sosillay
hardly
any
one
spoke
except
in
whispers
after
some
delay
sherbet
was
brought
to
him
and
he
seemed
to
revive
he
sat
up
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
as
though
his
brain
was
bewildered
then
he
arose
and
looked
around
him
his
face
was
wan
and
careworn
those
few
minutes
appeared
to
have
done
the
work
of
years
many
burst
into
tears
ye
weep
he
said
ye
weep
why
should
ye
weep
for
one
abandoned
of
alla
i
have
no
hope
now
why
stay
ye
with
a
man
who
is
doomed
why
link
your
fate
to
a
drowning
wretch
who
hath
not
even
a
straw
upon
the
whirlpool
of
his
fate
to
clutch
at
go
ye
have
served
me
have
fought
for
me
bled
for
me
alla
keep
ye
ye
have
been
my
friends
my
companions
i
have
been
harsh
often
cruel
will
ye
pardon
me
will
ye
pardon
a
poor
slave
of
alla
go
ever
loved
ye
and
he
was
interrupted
an
officer
with
streaming
eyes
rushed
from
a
side
of
the
tent
and
throwing
himself
at
the
sultaun
s
feet
clasped
his
knees
and
sobbed
passionately
aloud
tippoo
could
endure
no
more
he
who
had
been
by
turns
bitter
in
sarcasm
brutal
in
mirth
cruel
proud
exacting
unfeeling
tyrannical
overbearing
among
his
subjects
was
now
humbled
he
appeared
to
struggle
for
a
moment
but
unable
to
quell
the
wild
tumult
within
him
he
burst
into
first
he
had
ever
been
seen
to
shed
then
ensued
a
scene
which
words
can
not
scene
of
passionate
raving
of
tears
of
oaths
of
fidelity
to
death
men
embraced
one
another
and
swore
to
die
side
by
side
those
who
had
cherished
animosities
for
years
cast
themselves
on
each
other
s
breasts
and
forgot
enmity
in
the
bond
of
general
affliction
all
swore
before
alla
and
the
prophet
by
the
sultaun
s
head
and
the
salt
they
ate
that
they
would
die
as
martyrs
they
determined
to
retreat
upon
the
city
and
to
fight
under
its
walls
to
death
the
army
retired
and
awaited
the
onset
but
they
were
disappointed
the
english
army
passed
three
miles
to
the
left
in
glittering
array
and
encamped
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
fort
to
that
on
which
the
former
attack
had
been
made
and
for
the
time
the
sultaun
exulted
in
his
safety
days
passed
the
thunder
of
cannon
ceased
not
night
or
day
and
the
hearts
of
all
were
appalled
no
mercy
was
expected
from
the
british
death
would
have
been
welcome
at
first
but
its
gradual
approach
and
the
stern
progression
of
the
english
to
victory
could
not
be
shut
out
from
men
s
eyes
all
the
redoubts
beyond
the
fort
had
been
carried
long
ago
even
the
french
upon
whom
the
eye
of
the
sultaun
rested
in
hope
were
beaten
back
by
the
native
troops
of
his
enemies
though
they
fought
bravely
then
he
felt
how
he
had
been
cajoled
deceived
betrayed
into
destruction
to
all
his
letters
to
the
english
commander
there
was
but
one
the
money
and
the
hostages
and
the
cannon
shall
cease
but
not
before
at
this
his
proud
heart
rebelled
there
were
those
around
him
who
still
ridiculed
the
idea
of
danger
but
he
well
knew
its
reality
day
by
day
the
mosque
resounded
with
his
frantic
prayers
the
moolas
to
this
day
tell
how
impious
they
he
raved
prayed
cursed
by
turns
till
those
who
heard
believed
that
a
judgment
would
follow
them
he
held
no
communication
with
his
family
for
his
presence
in
the
zenana
was
ever
a
signal
for
an
outburst
of
grief
he
lived
in
his
hall
of
audience
or
in
a
small
room
off
it
where
most
part
of
the
day
and
night
was
passed
in
vain
astrological
calculations
or
those
horrible
magical
rites
we
have
before
alluded
to
at
other
times
he
was
upon
the
walls
directing
cannon
and
firing
with
his
own
hand
the
breach
became
practicable
the
guns
on
both
sides
of
it
had
long
been
silenced
and
men
looked
on
at
the
work
of
destruction
and
heard
the
storm
of
shot
shells
and
grape
which
poured
through
it
in
sullen
despair
the
brave
meer
ghuffoor
who
was
devoted
to
the
sultaun
saw
that
it
could
not
be
defended
much
longer
when
the
day
dawned
he
went
to
the
monarch
to
try
to
rouse
him
to
a
sense
of
his
danger
it
was
vain
there
is
nothing
between
thee
and
thine
enemies
o
my
sultaun
said
the
syud
nothing
to
prevent
the
storm
their
men
are
ready
in
the
trenches
and
have
been
there
since
it
was
light
i
have
watched
them
the
walls
are
gone
if
your
slave
is
permitted
he
will
commence
a
wall
and
a
ditch
across
the
inside
that
can
not
be
breached
and
it
will
stop
go
syud
we
fear
not
said
the
sultaun
we
have
hope
in
other
things
events
will
happen
which
thou
knowest
not
of
the
english
will
be
blasted
this
from
the
face
of
the
earth
already
we
have
ordered
fateehas
for

feel
for
thy
zeal
but
there

these
many
days
but

the
sultaun

as
thou
wilt
but

me
runga
swamee
what
news

thou
prepared
all

said
the
syud
as
he
went
out
i
shudder
at
his
communion
with
those
brahmin
infidels
i
would
to
alla
i
were
with
my
old
brethren

but
that

now
impossible

the
brahmin

the
prisoners
died
in
the
night
it
was
hard
work
there
were
so
many
but
it
was
done
and
he
chuckled
there
were
twelve
last

if
the
fort
is
taken
the
kafirs
will
look
in
vain
for
their
brethren
now

wilt
gain
much
favour
for
this
and
thy
gifts
to
thousand
years
of
protection
for
every
inshalla
said
the
sultaun
go
time
it
was
noon
the
day
was
bright
and
hot
and
a
strong
mirage
flickered
upon
the
white
tents
of
the
english
camp
the
parched
ground
around
them
and
the
black
and
rocky
bed
of
the
river
in
the
camp
many
men
were
moving
about
and
marching
to
and
fro
the
sultaun
was
looking
at
them
with
his
telescope
but
saw
nothing
to
excite
alarm
he
was
gayer
than
usual
for
he
had
seen
his
face
in
a
jar
of
oil
and
the
reflection
had
been
fortunate
rain
will
fall
in
the
hills
he
said
to
a
favourite
near
him
rajah
khan
as
he
observed
some
heavy
masses
of
white
fleecy
clouds
in
the
west
which
hung
over
the
nearer
hills
and
shrouded
the
distant
peaks
the
brahmins
are
right
the
sacrifice
has
done
good
after
all
only
a
few
feringhees
have
gone
to
hell
before
their
ha
may
your
prosperity
increase
said
the
officer
they
have
deserved
their
as
he
spoke
a
man
rushed
up
the
steps
of
the
cavalier
tears
were
in
his
eyes
and
his
manner
was
wild
what
has
happened
o
fool
said
the
sultaun
hast
thou
seen
the
devil
khodawund
said
the
soldier
speaking
with
difficulty
the
syud
the
holy
meer
ghuffoor
is
merciful
alla
cried
tippoo
art
thou
sure
of
this
alas
quite
sure
light
of
the
world
i
carried
him
away
behold
his
it
was
his
destiny
said
the
sultaun
gloomily
it
was
once
said
his
fate
was
linked
with
mine
it
come
his
death
was
that
of
a
soldier
may
mine
be
the
same
go
let
him
be
buried
with
honour
we
will
dine
here
he
added
to
an
attendant
we
feel
hot
within
and
this
air
from
the
water
is
his
light
repast
was
soon
finished
and
again
he
sat
looking
towards
the
trenches
he
thought
there
were
many
men
in
them
as
if
by
mutual
consent
the
firing
had
ceased
on
both
sides
and
no
sound
arose
except
the
busy
hum
of
the
city
in
the
english
camp
all
was
still
as
death
he
speculated
for
a
while
idly
upon
the
unusual
quietness
and
looked
again
on
a
sudden
a
man
climbed
upon
the
mound
of
the
trench
he
was
tall
and
noble
in
appearance
his
height
was
exaggerated
by
his
looked
a
giant
the
sultaun
s
heart
sank
within
him
he
could
not
be
mistaken
in
those
was
baird
whom
he
had
so
often
reviled
he
comes
to
revenge
the
old
man
he
to
revenge
mathews
it
was
a
noble
sight
to
see
that
one
man
stand
thus
alone
in
front
of
both
armies
he
appeared
to
look
at
the
fort
for
an
instant
then
drew
his
sword
from

to
his

he
was
a
native
and
wore
a
steel

and
glittering
a
shield
hung
on
his
arm
and
he
waved
a
broad
sabre
they
leaped
together
from
the

followed
by
hundreds
who
with
loud

chapter

to
the
breach
to
the
breach
was
now
the
cry
far
and
wide
those
who
loved
the
sultaun
hurried
there
to
die
to
stop
with
their
bodies
the
ascent
of
the
devoted
living
wall
in
place
of
that
which
had
been
torn
down
it
was
a
sight
on
which
men
looked
with
throbbing
hearts
and
aching
eyes
from
both
in
the
english
camp
and
those
in
the
fort
there
were
but
few
cannon
to
stop
the
english
all
upon
the
breach
had
been
dismounted
and
no
one
dared
show
himself
upon
the
dismantled
defences
to
plant
others
but
as
the
british
advanced
a
storm
of
shot
and
rockets
met
them
which
was
enough
to
have
turned
more
daring
men
many
went
down
before
it
many
writhed
and
struggled
the
column
was
like
a
march
of
ants
where
a
human
foot
has
just
trodden
some
hurrying
on
a
few
turning
to
carry
away
a
wounded
and

not

the
such
broken
sentences
escaped
him
from
time
to
time
as
he
fired
upon
the
enemy
with
his
own
hand
often
with
deadly
aim
but
though
the
resistance
made
was
desperate
what
was
able
to
withstand
the
hot
ardour
of
this
assault
man
after
man
went
down
before
the
strong
arm
of
baird
who
toiled
like
a
knight
of
old
in
the
breach
cheering
on
his
men
with
loud
cries
of
revenge
for
the
murdered
kasim
fought
beside
him
and
equalled
the
deeds
of
the

around

said
tippoo
doggedly
they

but
the
ditch
is
yet
before
can
not
pass
it
unless
it
is
filled
as
it
was
bah
why
should
i
have
thought
of
that
scene
this
passed
in
a
moment
the
struggle
on
the
breach
was
defenders
and
their
enemies
lay
there
in
heaps
still
there
was
the
ditch
to
cross
which
was
wide
and
deep
for
an
instant
even
baird
was
staggered
and
his
men
ran
right
and
left
seeking
for
a
passage
kasim
ali
and
he
were
close
together
there
was
a
scaffolding
and
a
plank
over
it
leading
to
the
rampart
on
the
other
side
it
was
enough
the
way
was
found
and
hundreds
poured
over
it
quicker
than
thought
it
was
the
last
sight
the
sultaun
else
swam
before
his
eyes
he
looked
stupefied
and
said
hurriedly
and
gloomily
it
is
are
my
bearers
take
me
to
the
women
must
one
we
would
not
have
them
defiled
by
the
kafirs
come
haste
or
we
are
too
they
led
him
to
his
palankeen
mingling
with
the
fugitives
who
in
the
passage
between
the
two
walls
were
rushing
on
to
the
small
postern
where
it
had
been
left
men
had
been
sent
for
it
but
what
bearers
could
struggle
against
that
frantic
crowd
as
they
hurried
on
rajah
khan
vainly
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
to
fly
by
the
poornea
and
his
son
were
out
he
said
and
they
might
yet
escape
to
the
fastnesses
of
the
west

cried
the
sultaun

then
we
will
throw
ourselves
upon
the
kafirs
cry
alla

and
die
may
hell
be
their
portion
he
exclaimed
suddenly
as
he
stumbled
and
fell
they
raised
shot
had
struck
him
he
was
sick
to
death
but
they
were
strong
men
and
they
urged
him
on
supporting
him
another
cry
he
saw
blood
pour
from
his
was
wounded
once
more
but
the
gate
was
close
at
hand
and
they
strained
every
nerve
to
reach
it
hundreds
were
struggling
there
the
fierce
english
were
behind
advancing
with
loud
oaths
and
cheers
maddened
by
excited
revenge
slaughter
lust
and
hope
of
plunder
a
fearful
thing
is
a
strife
like
that
when
men
become
monsters
thirsting
for
blood
they
reached
the
palankeen
and
laid
the
sultaun
in
it
water
water
he
gasped

he
cried
rousing
himself
at
the
last
words
no
they
burn
for
revenge
and
i
should
be
hung
like
a
dog
no
i
will

he
was
very
faint
and
spoke
feebly
here

a

the
first
cried
a
soldier
dashing
into
the
gateway
and
snatching
rudely
at
the
rosary
which
was
around
the
sultaun
s
neck
it
rallied
the
expiring
lamp
of
life
dog
of
a
kafir
son
of
an
unchaste
mother
cried
the
sultaun
gnashing
his
teeth
as
he
seized
a
sword
which
lay
by
him
get
thee
to
hell
and
he
struck
at
him
with
all
his
might
it
was
the
last
effort
of
life
but
it
was
not
fatal
damnation
muttered
the
man
setting
his
teeth
with
the
pain
of
the
wound
as
he
raised
his
musket
he
fired
the
ball
pierced
the
skull
the
sultaun
s
eyes
glared
for
an
instant
quivered
in
their
sockets
then
his
head
fell
and
he
was
dead
the
lion
of
the
faith
the
refuge
of
the
world
had
gone
to
his
account
well
met
noble
kasim
cried
philip
dalton
as
heading
his
party
he
dashed
down
the
cavalier
which
had
first
been
gained
and
was
now
in
the
body
of
the
place
keep
with
me
thou
knowest
the
prisons
every
one
colonel
but
haste
they
may
even
now
be
destroying
philip
shuddered
there
was
no
time
for
thought
many
men
were
around
him
and
they
rushed
on
led
by
kasim
ali
whose
reddened
sword
and
armour
sprinkled
with
blood
showed
how
he
had
been
employed
eagerly
and
with
excitement
which
hardly
admitted
thought
so
engrossing
was
it
did
those
two
and
charles
hayward
search
every
part
of
the
fort
and
every
place
where
it
was
possible
that
prisoners
could
have
been
concealed
they
found
none
and
when
the
palace
was
opened
they
rushed
into
its
most
secret
prisons
and
burst
them
open
they
found
traces
of
recent
habitation
by
englishmen
and
while
their
fears
were
horribly
confirmed
their
last
hopes
for
herbert
compton
departed
ah
could
i
but
meet
the
villain
jaffar
cried
kasim
as
they
gave
up
further
search
for
it
was
now
dark
if
indeed
he
be
alive
then
would
we
wring
from
him
the
fate
of
your
poor
friend
inshalla
he
may
be
found
i
know
his
haunts
and
will
watch
them
all
night
i
will
come
to
thee
in
the
i
shall
be
here
with
my
regiment
dalton
said
sadly
but
i
have
no
hope
for
that
cowardly
villain
will
have
fled
long
ere
now
with
his
the
morning
broke
gloomily
after
that
fearful
day
and
night
for
during
the
latter
there
had
been
appalling
alarms
shots
screams
from
terrified
plundered
and
often
violated
women
there
were
many
dreadful
excesses
but
they
were
checked
as
the
day
advanced
order
was
restored
once
more
and
the
moderation
of
the
english
in
their
victory
their
justice
and
protection
of
all
is
yet
sung
and
said
through
the
country
by
wandering
minstrels
the
sultaun
s
body
had
been
discovered
where
he
had
fallen
his
faithful
attendant
lay
beside
him
with
others
who
had
fought
with
him
to
the
last
they
were
brought
into
the
palace
and
recognised
by
the
women
with
unfeigned
and
bitter
grief
of
all
that
host
of
secluded
women
two
only
truly
mourned
his
fate
the
one
was
his
mother
the
other
fureeda
who
could
with
difficulty
be
torn
from
his
body
as
they
took
it
away
for
burial
her
love
had
grown
with
misfortune
for
in
her
society
he
had
found
rest
from
care
and
from
his
own
restless
mind
of
late
he
had
visited
no
other
and
despite
of
his
vices
she
had
felt
security
with
him
whom
no
one
else
looked
on
without
fear
and
as
his
fate
approached
she
foresaw
it
pitied
and
loved
him
the
last
rites
of
the
faith
had
been
performed
upon
the
body
the
grave
clothes
which
brought
from
mekha
had
been
for
years
in
his
possession
were
put
on
with
the
requisite
ceremonies
ablutions
and
fumigations
the
sheet
filled
with
flowers
was
laid
over
the
body
the
attendant
moolas
chanted
thrice
those
parts
of
the
koran
the
soora
e
fateeha
and
the
qool
hoo
alla
they
were
about
to
raise
it
to
place
it
in
the
coffin
when
two
women
again
rushed
in
the
one
was
old
wrinkled
and
was
his
nurse
she
beat
her
bare
and
withered
breasts
and
kneeling
beside
the
corpse
showed
them
to
it
with
passionate
exclamations
thou
hast
sucked
them
she
cried
when
i
was
young
and
they
were
full
of
milk
alas
alas
that
i
should
have
lived
to
say
i
bestow
it
on
the
other
was
fureeda
she
spoke
not
but
sobbed
bitterly
as
she
looked
on
the
pinched
and
sharpened
features
and
livid
face
of
him
who
had
till
the
last
clung
to
her
with
affection
they
were
removed
with
difficulty
and
the
procession
passed
out
slowly
the
moolas
chanting
the
funeral
service
with
slow
and
melancholy
cadences
the
conquerers
of
the
dead
awaited
his
coming
and
in
silent
homage
to
their
illustrious
enemy
lifted
their
plumed
hats
from
their
brows
as
the
body
passed
on
to
its
last
beside
the
noble
hyder
the
troops
which
had
the
day
before
been
arrayed
in
arms
against
him
now
paid
the
last
honours
to
his
death
and
through
a
street
of
british
soldiers
resting
upon
their
firearms
reversed
while
their
bands
played
the
dead
march
in
saul
the
procession
wound
its
way
without
in
the
street
were
thousands
of
men
who
frantic
in
their
grief
cried
aloud
to
alla
and
women
who
beat
their
breasts
and
wailed
or
else
uttered
piercing
shrieks
of
woe
flung
dust
into
the
air
and
casting
loose
their
hair
strove
to
prostrate
themselves
before
the
body
of
the
dead
the
solemn
chant
proceeded
each
verse
sung
by
the
moolas
who
in
their
flowing
robes
preceded
the
coffin
was
repeated
by
all
around
the
body
was
surrounded
by
all
the
officers
of
tippoo
s
late
army
who
had
survived
and
those
of
the
nizam
s
force
on
foot
and
there
was
one
of
his
sons
on
horseback
who
sat
in
a
kind
of
stupor
at
the
overwhelming
affliction
the
day
had
been
gloomy
and
was
close
and
hot
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirred
the
trees
and
heavy
lurid
masses
of
clouds
hung
over
the
city
from
whence
at
times
a
low
muttering
growl
of
thunder
would
break
and
seemingly
rattle
all
over
the
heavens
men
felt
heavily
the
weight
of
the
atmosphere
and
every
now
and
then
looked
up
at
the
threatening
mass
which
hung
above
them
through
the
plain
which
extends
to
the
mausoleum
of
hyder
the
multitude
poured
and
as
the
procession
gradually
approached
its
goal
the
frantic
cries
of
the
people
increased
almost
drowning
the
melancholy
dead
march
and
the
chant
which
arose
now
one
now
the
other
and
sometimes
both
blended
into
a
wild
harmony
upon
the
still
air
then
there
was
a
momentary
silence
only
to
be
succeeded
by
bursts
of
grief
even
more
violent
than
before
the
thunder
appeared
to
increase
in
loudness
every
moment
while
flashes
of
lightning
darted
across
the
heavens
from
side
to
side
the
procession
reached
the
the
grenadiers
formed
a
street
rested
upon
their
firearms
reversed
and
the
body
passed
on
the
band
now
ceased
and
the
bier
being
laid
down
the
body
was
taken
from
it
preparatory
to
being
laid
in
the
grave
the
moola
for
one
alone
now
officiated
raised
his
voice
in
the
chant
of
the
first
creed
it
was
a
powerful
one
but
now
sounded
thin
and
small
among
that
vast
assembly
he
had
said
only
a
few
words
when
a
flash
of
lightning
burst
from
above
nearly
blinding
them
and
a
peal
of
thunder
followed
so
crashing
so
stunning
that
the
stoutest
hearts
quailed
under
it
it
died
away
and
as
it
receded
far
into
the
east
the
melancholy
tone
of
the
moola
s
voice
which
had
been
drowned
in
it
again
arose
clear
and
distinct
like
the
distant
wail
of
a
trumpet
the
heavens
were
still
for
a
while
but
as
the
body
was
laid
in
its
last
narrow
its
face
to
the
west
and
as
the
moolas
chanted
out
salāam
wo
aliekoom
wo
ruhmut
ullāāh
again
a
crashing
peal
burst
forth
and
their
words
were
lost
in
the
deafening
roar
now
peal
after
peal
rolled
from
the
clouds
as
yet
there
was
no
rain
nor
wind
and
the
black
mass
appeared
almost
to
descend
upon
the
tall
which
waved
above
and
flashes
of
lightning
so
vivid
that
the
heavens
blazed
under
the
light
darted
from
it
and
played
fearfully
around
men
looked
at
each
other
in
awe
and
wonder
and
felt
their
own
littleness
when
the
mighty
lay
cold
in
death
before
them
and
the
thunder
of
his
creator
roared
seemingly
as
in
deprecation
of
the
deeds
of
his
life
footnote
peace
and
the
grace
of
god
be
with
you
the
companies
formed
on
each
side
of
the
grave
to
pay
their
last
tribute
of
respect
to
a
soldier
s
memory
and
the
word
was
fire
the
rattle
which
followed
seemed
to
be
taken
up
by
the
sky
away
rolled
the
awful
echoes
into
the
far
west
and
lost
for
a
moment
among
the
huge
crags
and
mountains
of
the
ghâts
seemed
to
return
with
double
force
to
meet
the
peals
of
artillery
and
volleys
of
musketry
which
broke
from
the
fort
and
the
british
army
the
bands
struck
up
again
but
they
were
dimly
heard
and
as
all
returned
to
the
sound
of
their
merry
music
it
seemed
a
mockery
amidst
the
din
and
turmoil
of
that
tempest
but
we
must
carry
our
readers
back
to
herbert
compton
over
whom
years
had
passed
chequered
by
no
events
save
the
visits
of
jaffar
sahib
to
urge
upon
him
compliance
with
the
sultaun
s
demands
for
assistance
plans
of
fortifications
or
military
instructions
the
sultaun
had
from
the
first
taken
it
into
his
head
that
herbert
was
a
man
of
education
and
skill
beyond
his
fellows
and
as
every
idea
was
esteemed
a
revelation
from
providence
he
had
clung
to
this
one
with
all
the
obstinacy
of
his
nature
for
he
had
a
necessity
for
the
aid
herbert
might
have
given
often
he
would
forget
him
for
months
once
or
twice
provoked
by
his
obstinate
refusals
he
had
issued
orders
for
his
death
and
revoked
as
fast
as
he
had
written
them
herbert
had
lingered
on
upon
those
mountains
the
cold
and
mists
of
which
exaggerated
to
the
sultaun
made
him
suppose
that
the
place
was
the
one
where
hardship
would
be
the
greatest
and
life
the
most
difficult
to
bear
but
he
knew
not
of
that
glorious
climate
of
its
cool
fresh
elastic
invigorating
breezes
of
its
exquisite
scenery
of
the
thousands
of
wild
flowers
and
green
hills
and
hanging
woods
deep
wooded
glens
in
which
brawled
clear
and
sparkling
rivers
now
chafing
over
a
pebbly
bed
now
creeping
still
under
some
golden
mossy
bank
covered
with
wild
thyme
and
violets
from
among
which
peered
the
modest
primrose
the
graceful
cyclamen
and
tall
fern
which
nodded
over
the
sparkling
water
he
knew
not
what
ecstasy
it
was
to
herbert
to
lie
at
length
upon
the
soft
sward
and
to
listen
to
the
melody
of
the
blackbird
which
in
the
joy
of
its
heart
trilled
its
liquid
song
and
was
answered
joyously
by
its
to
see
the
lark
high
in
air
wheeling
around
in
wide
circles
till
it
was
lost
to
sight
the
same
as
he
had
used
to
listen
to
with
amy
in
the
groves
of
beechwood
herbert
s
thoughts
were
often
carried
back
to
the
past
remembering
with
the
minutest
exactitude
every
tone
every
word
of
their
sweet
converse
it
was
an
unreal
life
with
none
of
the
world
s
occurrences
before
him
from
his
high
prison
he
looked
forth
over
a
wide
country
but
he
could
only
speculate
idly
upon
what
was
passing
in
the
world
he
had
no
hope
of
deliverance
ever
since
the
first
siege
of
the
city
of
which
he
heard
after
the
english
had
departed
he
had
ceased
to
think
of
liberty
except
in
death
he
had
no
hope
that
his
life
his
intellect
which
he
felt
to
be
strong
and
vigorous
would
ever
be
called
into
the
action
they
were
fitted
for
his
kind
heart
his
affectionate
sympathies
find
again
objects
on
which
to
fix
he
had
no
companion
but
nature
upon
whose
varying
face
he
could
always
look
with
delight
while
he
listened
to
the
brawling
streams
the
murmurs
of
the
waving
sweet
voices
with
which
she
peoples
her
solitudes
yet
latterly
he
had
found
a
companion
one
of
the
guards
brought
a
dog
herbert
attached
it
to
himself
and
the
man
gave
it
him
when
he
went
away
he
could
speak
to
could
speak
english
to
it
and
as
they
would
sit
upon
a
sunny
bank
together
he
listening
idly
to
the
murmuring
plash
of
waters
the
hum
of
bees
watching
the
bright
flies
as
they
sported
in
the
sunbeams
or
the
butterflies
flying
from
flower
to
in
the
loveliness
of
the
prospects
whether
over
the
vast
blue
plains
and
endless
ranges
of
mountains
or
inwards
among
the
quiet
peaceful
valleys
and
swelling
would
after
musing
a
while
speak
to
his
favourite
of
her
he
loved
of
his
home
of
his
mother
and
often
when
tears
started
to
his
eyes
and
his
voice
faltered
the
dog
would
look
at
him
wistfully
and
whine
gently
as
he
scratched
him
with
his
paw
he
seemed
to
know
there
was
something
wrong
and
he
thus
expressed
his
sympathy
and
when
herbert
arose
to
go
he
would
run
in
wide
circles
upon
the
chasing
the
larks
from
their
nests
tearing
the
grass
with
his
teeth
and
barking
so
joyfully
that
herbert
s
spirit
would
be
gladdened
too
but
who
can
tell
his
yearnings
for
the
sight
of
a
face
beside
those
of
his
one
word
from
a
countryman
if
ever
he
should
escape
what
tidings
might
be
in
store
for
the
changes
the
events
of
years
escape
alas
that
was
impossible
everywhere
the
same
rugged
sides
presented
themselves
everywhere
the
same
vast
forests
below
to
enter
which
was
death
and
beyond
them
the
territory
of
the
sultaun
he
often
longed
to
make
a
second
attempt
to
be
free
but
his
better
thoughts
proved
its
utter
impracticability
one
day
a
few
showers
had
fallen
and
the
air
was
soft
and
balmy
the
dry
winds
of
may
had
already
abated
and
the
summer
was
beginning
to
burst
forth
herbert
was
lying
upon
the
spot
which
we
have
once
mentioned
in
hulleekul
droog
his
little
garden
was
freshened
by
the
late
rain
and
the
odour
of
the
flowers
came
to
him
gratefully
as
he
looked
over
the
wide
prospect
now
so
familiar
yet
for
all
that
presenting
in
colour
in
effect
perpetually
new
features
the
naik
of
his
guard
came
to
him
arise
he
said
i
have
news
for
speak
said
what
news
is
jaffar
coming
again
is
he
arrived
not
so
said
the
man
thou
art
to
herbert
s
heart
sank
within
him
to
travel
he
said
anxiously
has
the
sultaun
sent
for
me
no
said
the
man
has
is
dead
the
english
have
taken
the
city
and
the
sultaun
is
no
merciful
providence
cried
herbert
aloud
in
his
own
tongue
is
this
true
or
is
it
a
dream
didst
thou
say
ay
sahib
said
the
man
dashing
a
tear
from
his
eye
he
was
a
great
man
and
has
died
like
a
soldier
wilt
thou
come
thy
countrymen
will
look
for
thee
now
and
perhaps
the
act
of
taking
thee
to
them
will
give
me
favour
in
their
eyes
as
to
this
post
it
will
be
one
will
need
it
and
if
we
remain
here
no
one
will
remember
us
what
dost
thou
think
but
he
spoke
to
one
who
heeded
not
his
hardly
fell
upon
his
ear
herbert
had
knelt
down
and
on
the
spot
where
his
first
vision
of
escape
had
come
to
him
where
he
now
heard
he
was
free
he
poured
forth
thoughts
that
were
too
big
for
matter
they
rose
out
of
a
grateful
glowing
heart
and
ascended
to
the
throne
of
him
who
looked
into
it
and
saw
the
feelings
there
while
the
words
that
expressed
them
passed
away
upon
the
sighing
wind
unheeded
herbert
arose
art
thou
ready
he
said
morning
sahib
ere
the
dawn
is
a
will
set
out
in
four
days
if
we
travel
fast
we
shall
be
at
the
have
you
seen
the
poor
fellow
who
has
been
just
brought
into
camp
upon
a
cot
dalton
said
an
officer
of
the
staff
who
lounged
into
philip
s
tent
about
noon
some
days
after
the
above
it
seems
he
was
confined
in
a
and
the
garrison
have
brought
him
in
poor
fellow
he
is
in
a
high
fever
for
they
rested
by
the
way
in
the
jungles
and
there
he
took
it
but
is
looking
after
him
they
have
taken
him
into
the
some
native
i
suppose
said
philip
looking
up
he
was
writing
to
his
wife
englishman
it
was
supposed
there
were
none
left
good
heavens
cried
philip
seizing
his
cap
and
rushing
precipitately
from
the
tent
if
it
should
be
he
providence
he
flew
across
the
camp
the
officer
looked
after
him
in
wonder
what
can
he
mean
he
said
aloud
he
saw
philip
run
at
full
speed
to
the
hospital
tent
and
he
followed
him
there
more
leisurely
and
looked
in
philip
was
kneeling
beside
the
bed
of
the
sufferer
whose
hands
were
clasped
in
his
the
tears
were
streaming
down
his
cheeks
and
he
was
striving
to
speak
the
other
s
eyes
were
upraised
while
his
lips
moved
as
if
in
prayer
and
a
look
of
silent
thankfulness
of
joy
of
perfect
peace
and
happiness
was
upon
his
handsome
features
which
he
could
hardly
have
conceived
expressible
by
any
emotions
he
looked
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
hurried
away
to
hide
his
own
it
must
be
captain
compton
he
said
so
long
missing
i
will
not
disturb
it
was
indeed
in
that
silent
grasp
of
the
hand
the
long
earnest
loving
embrace
which
had
preceded
it
the
recognition
at
once
of
the
friend
and
even
brother
of
his
early
years
herbert
had
already
forgotten
all
his
sufferings
he
had
caught
a
branch
upon
the
shore
he
had
so
long
floated
past
and
leaped
upon
it
and
now
secure
could
even
in
that
moment
follow
the
frail
raft
which
had
so
long
borne
his
sad
fortunes
and
gradually
lose
sight
of
it
in
the
visions
which
opened
before
him
not
long
did
he
remain
on
that
humble
pallet
removed
to
philip
s
tent
and
in
his
company
and
that
of
charles
hayward
he
felt
as
they
told
him
of
the
events
of
the
past
that
it
was
like
one
of
those
blissful
fancies
which
had
cheated
him
so
often
he
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
of
joy
and
peace
vaguely
and
indefinitely
and
awoke
refreshed
by
rest
and
the
prescriptions
of
the
surgeon
who
attended
him
he
gazed
around
and
his
eyes
met
the
happy
faces
and
joyful
looks
of
his
friends
then
only
did
he
feel
it
all
to
be
true
conclusion
day
by
day
herbert
made
progress
towards
recovery
and
with
peace
of
mind
returned
strength
and
vigour
he
had
been
ill
for
nearly
a
fortnight
before
the
time
we
speak
of
and
had
been
tended
with
that
constant
and
unremitting
solicitude
by
his
dear
friends
and
brothers
which
can
easily
be
imagined
but
not
easily
described
there
was
another
too
the
brave
kasim
ali
who
had
been
quickly
summoned
to
philip
s
tent
after
the
arrival
of
the
lost
one
and
who
had
rejoiced
in
his
recovery
with
joy
as
genuine
as
the
others
how
often
i
told
you
to
hope
sahib
he
would
exclaim
as
he
looked
on
the
joy
of
the
friends
and
their
love
for
each
other
how
often
i
said
he
was
not
dead
that
the
sultaun
may
his
sepulchre
be
honoured
would
not
destroy
and
then
they
would
shake
their
heads
and
think
that
if
the
sultaun
had
been
alive
how
little
would
have
been
the
chance
of
their
ever
meeting
again
upon
earth
you
appear
to
cling
to
his
memory
with
fondness
said
dalton
in
reply
to
a
burst
of
praise
which
kasim
had
uttered
yet
he
used
you
ill
and
would
have
killed
i
do
he
replied
he
was
a
great
an
one
as
hind
will
never
see
again
he
had
great
ambition
wonderful
ability
perseverance
and
the
art
of
leading
men
s
hearts
more
than
they
were
aware
of
or
cared
to
acknowledge
he
had
patient
application
and
nothing
was
done
without
his
sanction
even
to
the
meanest
affairs
and
the
business
of
his
dominions
was
vast
you
will
allow
he
was
brave
and
died
like
a
soldier
he
was
kind
and
considerate
to
his
servants
and
a
steady
friend
to
those
he
loved
mashalla
he
was
a
great
yet
he
was
treacherous
to
you
meer
sahib
said
philip
ay
and
had
he
not
been
so
ye
might
now
have
been
far
from
hence
ye
see
sirs
the
power
of
destiny
which
working
even
by
such
mean
instruments
as
myself
and
jaffar
has
wrought
great
what
treachery
said
herbert
i
have
wondered
to
see
thee
here
in
the
english
camp
but
thought
thou
mightest
have
been
admitted
to
protection
like
the
rest
of
the
sultaun
s
it
is
a
long
tale
said
kasim
but
your
brother
the
colonel
knows
much
of
it
already
and
he
will
tell
it
to
not
so
said
philip
tell
it
yourself
i
should
only
blunder
in
the
narration
and
he
added
since
we
have
been
together
i
have
never
asked
after
the
lady
you
loved
meer
sahib
it
is
a
painful
question
perhaps
and
may
awaken
thoughts
and
feelings
long
since
dead
you
rejoice
to
see
you
know
sahib
we
moslems
are
not
given
to
speaking
of
our
wives
or
families
said
kasim
and
therefore
i
have
never
mentioned
her
but
she
lives
i
rejoice
to
say
and
is
as
beautiful
to
my
eyes
as
come
said
herbert
if
it
be
a
tale
of
love
let
me
hear
it
i
have
talked
long
enough
and
can
listen
kasim
then
related
his
adventures
from
the
time
he
had
appeared
a
youth
in
tippoo
s
durbar
to
that
in
which
wearied
by
his
cruelties
and
uneven
temper
he
had
left
him
and
had
so
narrowly
escaped
assassination
i
reached
my
village
he
continued
and
long
remained
in
secrecy
enjoying
the
quiet
of
my
own
home
i
read
my
favourite
poets
wrote
verses
and
a
history
of
my
own
adventures
to
pass
the
time
but
in
truth
after
so
much
excitement
i
at
length
grew
tired
of
the
dull
life
and
looked
around
me
for
employment
the
administration
of
the
affairs
and
collection
of
the
revenue
of
my
district
happened
then
to
be
vacated
by
the
person
who
had
held
the
offices
and
as
i
understood
the
duties
perfectly
i
solicited
and
obtained
the
situation
by
help
of
a
douceur
to
the
minister
in
its
duties
and
in
the
suppression
of
the
disorders
of
the
country
i
found
ample
employment
still
i
had
never
visited
the
city
of
hyderabad
and
as
i
had
need
to
go
there
to
arrange
some
matters
with
the
minister
regarding
the
revenue
collections
i
determined
upon
a
short
visit
and
was
courteously
received
both
by
him
and
by
the
prince
who
spoke
much
to
me
of
the
sultaun
s
character
and
the
wild
schemes
of
conquest
which
he
meditated
i
was
delighted
with
the
city
and
the
polite
and
courtly
character
of
its
nobles
and
i
remained
longer
than
i
had
intended
one
day
i
was
riding
towards
the
minister
s
house
in
order
to
take
my
leave
of
him
previously
to
my
departure
when
a
woman
rather
old
but
decently
dressed
as
a
servant
whose
features
at
first
sight
appeared
familiar
to
me
ran
towards
me
in
the
open
street
and
catching
hold
of
the
rein
of
my
horse
uttered
a
loud
cry
of
joy
the
horse
was
a
spirited
one
and
began
to
curvet
and
bound
and
she
dared
not
approach
me
i
saw
her
speak
to
my
groom
and
when
she
had
learned
where
i
lived
she
told
him
she
would
come
in
the
evening
waved
her
hand
to
me
and
darted
down
a
narrow
street
all
that
day
i
wondered
much
who
she
could
be
i
could
not
by
any
effort
recall
her
name
to
my
memory
and
though
i
had
an
engagement
with
a
friend
i
waited
at
home
till
late
about
dark
a
woman
came
closely
veiled
leading
another
both
as
they
entered
threw
themselves
at
my
feet
and
kissed
them
repeatedly
uttering
expressions
of
joy
they
could
not
speak
intelligibly
for
some
time
nor
would
they
unveil
though
i
could
hear
from
their
voices
that
they
were
aged
at
length
one
playfully
pulled
the
veil
from
the
other
s
head
and
to
my
joy
and
surprise
i
beheld
meeran
i
recognised
her
instantly
and
raising
her
up
embraced
her
cordially
sahib
the
other
was
sozun
i
was
as
you
may
suppose
breathless
to
know
ameena
s
fate
was
she
alive
or

that
hated
place
i
remembered
hold
her
mortal
remains

conjure

cried
for

how

worked
out
they
led
the
way
joyfully
her
mother
had
been
advised
of
my
presence
in
the
city
by
meeran
in
the
morning
and
closely
veiled
she
sat
in
her
private
apartment
awaiting
me
her
husband
was
absent
on
some
military
duty
so
i
had
to
arrange
all
with
her
how
my
heart
beat
as
i
entered
the
house
to
be
once
more
under
the
same
roof
with
her
who
had
loved
me
so
long
and
so
be
there
in
the
hope
that
ere
many
hours
should
elapse
she
would
be
for
ever
sahib
i
had
fought
and
bled
on
a
yet
i
never
felt
so
agitated
as
i
did
at
that
moment
a
cry
of
joy
from
the
old
lady
welcomed
me
blessed
be
alla
she
said
as
she
embraced
me
like
a
son
blessed
be
his
name
that
thou
art
here
oh
that
my
lord
were
here
to
welcome
thee
and
greet
thee
as
a
son
and
ameena
i
said

your
soul

am
high

now
in
that
of
your
own
government

be
let
me
i
beseech
you
speak
to
her
and
send
for
the
moola
to
read
the
fie
said
the
old
lady
that
would
be
indecent
what
after
years
of
absence
mother
nay
say
not
so
but
tell
her
i
am
wait
she
said
i
will
return
i
arose
and
walked
about
burning
with
love
with
hope
with
joy
the
passion
which
for
years
had
been
smothered
within
me
broke
out
as
freshly
as
strongly
as
when
i
had
first
seen
her
the
memory
of
that
kiss
was
as
if
it
still
lingered
on
my
lips
i
heard
a
movement
a
sort
of
hesitation
at
the
door
i
thought
the
old
lady
would
come
in
a
figure
entered
veiled
from
head
to
foot
it
was
a
useless
heart
told
me
that
it
was
ameena
i
rushed
towards
her
caught
her
tottering
form
in
my
arms
removed
the
veil
from
her
lovely
features
and
in
a
moment
more
strained
her
to
my
heart
in
an
embrace
which
she
did
not
resist
and
in
a
kiss
which
united
our
souls
once
more
i
pledged
to
her
my
faith
and
love
for
ever
yes
she
was
as
fair
as
ever
even
more
beautiful
in
the
mature
charms
of
womanhood
than
had
been
the
girl
i
bore
from
the
dreadful
waters
or
preserved
from
the
maddened
elephant
there
was
more
fulness
in
her
form
more
fire
in
the
large
and
soft
eye
which
filled
with
tears
rested
on
me
she
clung
to
me
as
though
i
should
never
part
from
her
again
and
her
hand
trembled
in
mine
i
understood
her
i
will
not
go
from
thee
fairest
most
beloved
i
cried
more
even
than
the
bulbul
to
the
rose
more
than
mejnoon
to
leila
will
i
be
to
thee
her
mother
entered
soon
after
she
saw
ameena
unveiled
and
in
my
arms
she
gently
chid
her
but
she
did
so
no
longer
when
the
fair
and
gentle
creature
bent
on
her
an
imploring
look
and
nestled
closer
to
my
bosom
the
next
evening
the
moola
came
all
had
been
prepared
in
the
meanwhile
and
such
a
marriage
as
mine
wanted
no
long
was
that
only
of
the
koran
some
friends
were
sent
for
in
their
presence
i
wrote
a
settlement
upon
ameena
and
received
an
assignment
of
all
her
property
it
was
little
needed
for
henceforth
our
lot
was
to
be
together
for
good
or
for
evil
there
was
a
screen
put
up
in
the
apartment
the
ladies
came
behind
it
i
heard
the
rustle
of
their
garments
and
the
tinkling
of
their
was
like
delicious
music
the
few
prayers
were
quickly
read
the
witnesses
signed
and
sealed
the
papers
and
they
left
me
i
heard
the
old
lady
bless
her
daughter
and
the
servants
join
in
a
fervent
ameen
in
a
few
moments
the
screen
was
withdrawn
and
i
was
alone
with
ameena
sirs
the
true
believer
when
he
enters
paradise
and
is
welcomed
by
the
beauteous
houris
that
await
his
coming
is
not
more
blessed
than
i
was
then
hours
flew
and
still
we
talked
over
the
past
and
the
miseries
and
sufferings
of
that
dreadful
time
tell
me
i
said
how
you
escaped
and
show
me
the
she
bared
her
beauteous
neck
modestly
and
shrinkingly
i
looked
on
the
wound
and
kissed
it
it
was
on
her
shoulder
and
had
reached
the
back
of
her
neck
a
heavy
gold
necklace
and
chain
she
said
had
saved
her
life
but
for
that
she
must
have
been
killed
but
she
continued
i
knew
nothing
until
i
found
myself
in
a
small
hut
sozun
was
there
and
meeran
i
shrank
from
sozun
for
i
knew
her
to
have
been
an
evil
woman
but
she
was
vehement
in
her
protestations
of
affection
and
i
believed
her
i
knew
not
till
long
after
how
nearly
she
had
been
connected
with
my
fate
but
she
has
been
faithful
and
that
is
long
since
forgiven
and
forgotten
in
her
constancy
the
house
belonged
to
her
daughter
and
her
husband
was
a
in
the
army
they
were
kind
and
good
to
me
and
the
faithful
zoolfoo
bound
up
my
wound
indeed
he
sewed
it
up
which
gave
me
great
pain
but
i
was
soon
strong
again
and
i
inquired
for
the
khan
and
for
you
they
said
you
had
both
fallen
and
i
mourned
you
as
dead
afterwards
when
the
sultaun
capitulated
and
there
was
peace
i
followed
my
protector
as
a
humble
woman
and
attended
by
meeran
and
sozun
under
pretence
of
making
offerings
at
a
shrine
we
escaped
from
the
fort
and
entered
that
of
the
troops
of
the
dekhan
although
my
father
had
not
accompanied
them
yet
i
found
his
intimate
friend
sikundur
beg
with
whose
daughters
i
had
been
a
playmate
he
was
a
father
to
me
gave
me
his
palankeen
to
travel
hither
and
in
my
own
home
i
speedily
i
should
weary
you
sirs
continued
kasim
after
a
pause
were
i
to
tell
you
of
her
daily
increasing
love
and
the
joy
i
felt
in
her
society
i
wrote
word
to
my
mother
that
i
had
met
her
and
was
married
and
the
old
lady
transported
with
joy
actually
travelled
up
to
the
city
to
greet
her
daughter
i
was
fortunate
in
meeting
with
a
good
deputy
in
the
person
of
my
excellent
uncle
and
i
remained
at
the
city
with
ameena
s
family
her
father
arrived
in
due
time
from
his
post
and
there
never
was
a
happier
circle
united
on
this
earth
than
ours
i
became
known
in
the
city
there
was
talk
of
a
war
with
the
sultaun
and
i
was
offered
the
command
of
a
risala
of
horse
and
received
a
title
from
the
government
they
are
common
but
i
was
honoured
distinguish
thyself
said
the
minister
thou
shalt
have
a
jaghire
for
sirs
ye
know
the
rest
he
has
given
me
two
villages
near
my
own
the
revenue
of
which
with
my
patrimony
and
the
command
of
five
hundred
horse
most
of
which
are
my
own
makes
me
easy
for
life
my
mother
she
has
notions
sometimes
hints
that
the
marriage
was
not
regular
that
i
should
even
now
ask
the
young
daughter
of
a
nobleman
of
high
rank
and
go
through
all
the
forms
with
her
but
i
am
content
sirs
with
one
wife
and
i
wish
to
alla
that
all
my
countrymen
were
so
too
for
i
am
well
assured
that
to
one
alone
can
a
man
give
all
his
love
and
that
where
more
than
one
is
there
ensue
those
jealousies
envies
wild
passions
evil
and
sin
which
were
fatal
to
my
footnote
estate
thou
art
a
noble
fellow
exclaimed
both
and
charles
hayward
he
also
had
been
a
his
praise
and
believe
me
added
dalton
thou
wilt
often
be
remembered
and
thy
wife
too
when
we
are
far
away
in
our
own
land
if
it
be
not
beyond
the
bounds
of
politeness
carry
her
our
affections
and
warmest
wishes
for
years
of
happiness
with
thee
i
would
that
my
wife
could
have
known
her
she
must
have
loved
one
so
sorely
tried
yet
so
pure
in
heart
thou
wilt
see
her
at
bangalore
meer
sahib
and
will
tell
thy
wife
of
the
tears
started
to
kasim
air
s
eyes
he
brushed
them
away
hastily
i
am
a
fool
said
he
but
if
any
one
when
i
served
him
who
ruled
yonder
had
told
me
that
i
should
have
loved
englishmen
i
would
have
quarrelled
with
him
even
to
bloodshed
and
now
i
should
be
unhappy
indeed
if
i
carried
not
away
your
esteem
i
thank
you
for
your
interest
in
ameena
i
will
tell
her
much
of
you
and
your
fortunes
and
when
you
are
in
your
own
green
and
beautiful
land
and
you
wander
beneath
cool
shady
groves
and
beside
murmuring
rivers
or
when
you
are
in
the
peaceful
society
of
your
own
homes
something
will
whisper
in
your
hearts
that
kasim
ali
and
ameena
speak
of
you
with
love
i
pray
you
then
remember
us
kindly
and
now
bid
me
depart
he
his
voice
trembled
i
have
spoken
long
and
the
captain
is
dalton
s
regiment
moved
soon
after
and
kasim
and
his
risala
accompanied
it
they
marched
by
easy
stages
and
soon
the
invalid
was
able
once
more
to
mount
a
horse
and
to
enjoy
a
gallop
with
the
dashing
risaldar
whose
horsemanship
was
beyond
all
praise
at
bangalore
they
halted
some
time
it
was
to
be
a
station
for
the
mysore
and
dalton
s
regiment
was
to
belong
to
it
his
wife
had
arrived
from
madras
and
the
deeply
attached
brother
and
sister
were
once
more
united
after
so
long
and
painful
an
absence
kasim
saw
her
there
and
though
he
thought
it
profanation
to
gaze
on
one
so
fair
yet
he
often
paid
his
respectful
homage
to
her
while
he
stayed
and
told
the
wondering
ameena
and
in
after
days
his
children
of
the
fair
skin
golden
hair
and
deep
blue
eyes
of
the
english
lady
and
as
he
would
dwell
in
rapture
upon
the
theme
they
thought
that
the
angels
of
paradise
could
not
be
fairer
when
kasim
ali
could
stay
no
longer
he
came
to
take
his
leave
i
shall
pass
the
old
fakeer
he
said
have
you
any
message
for
him
the
old
man
still
lives
and
prays
for
we
will
go
to
him
said
philip
tis
but
a
day
s
herbert
agreed
readily
and
they
set
out
that
day
the
old
man
s
joy
at
seeing
them
can
not
be
told
the
certainty
that
his
poor
efforts
were
estimated
with
gratitude
were
to
him
more
than
gold
or
precious
stones
but
his
declining
years
were
made
happy
by
an
annuity
which
was
regularly
paid
and
he
wanted
no
more
the
casual
charity
of
passing
travellers
and
there
beneath
those
beauteous
trees
which
even
now
remain
and
which
no
one
can
pass
without
admiration
the
friends
parted
with
sincere
regret
and
a
regard
which
never
diminished
though
they
never
met
again
the
martial
and
picturesque
companions
of
the
risaldar
awaited
him
philip
and
herbert
watched
him
as
he
bounded
into
his
saddle
and
soon
the
gay
and
glittering
group
was
lost
behind
the
trees
at
a
little
distance
about
three
weeks
after
the
fort
had
fallen
two
men
one
driving
a
pony
passed
out
of
the
gate
of
the
fort
and
took
their
way
towards
the
river
the
rain
had
fallen
much
during
that
and
the
previous
day
but
there
was
as
yet
no
more
water
than
usual
in
the
river
come
on
madar
said
one
whom
our
readers
will
easily
recognise
that
beast
goes
as
slow
as
if
he
had
an
elephant
s
load
come
on
we
are
lucky
to
get
across
for
there
is
no
water
in
the
i
tell
thee
the
brute
will
never
travel
jaffar
the
load
is
too
heavy
why
wouldst
thou
not
buy
the
other
i
could
not
afford
it
he
said
one
is
enough
come
on
the
pony
was
laden
with
gold
and
silver
bars
and
heavy
stuffs
cloth
of
gold
and
silver
the
plunder
of
years
and
more
especially
of
that
night
when
the
sultaun
was
killed
for
jaffar
knew
the
places
where
the
silver
and
gold
utensils
were
kept
and
he
had
laden
himself
with
the
spoil
he
he
he
said
he
chuckling
we
will
go
to
madras
and
live
with
the
kafir
feringhees
no
one
will
know
us
there
and
we
can
trade
with
this
good
said
madar
it
is
a
wise
thought
may
your
prosperity
increase
they
were
now
on
the
edge
of
the
river
opposite
the
fort
it
is
broad
and
the
bed
one
sheet
of
rock
has
been
worn
into
thousands
of
deep
holes
and
gulleys
by
the
impetuous
stream
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
get
the
beast
across
these
and
he
often
stumbled
and
fell
against
the
sharp
rocks
the
curses
of
the
shitan
light
on
thee
cried
jaffar
to
the
animal
as
it
lay
down
at
last
groaning
heavily
and
he
screwed
its
tail
desperately
to
urge
it
on
wilt
thou
not
get
up
help
me
madar
to
raise
they
did
so
by
their
united
strength
but
ere
it
had
gone
a
few
paces
it
fell
again
jaffar
was
in
despair
there
was
no
resource
but
to
unload
it
and
carry
the
burden
piece
by
piece
to
the
bank
they
were
doing
this
when
a
loud
roaring
was
heard
what
was
that
said
madar
nothing
fool
said
the
other
the
wind
i
dare
say
it
was
was
the
roaring
of
the
mighty
river
as
it
poured
down
beyond
the
sharp
turn
above
the
wall
of
water
three
feet
boiling
roaring
dashing
high
into
the
vast
brown
thick
muddy
mass
overwhelming
everything
in
its
course
madar
fled
at
once
to
the
bank
jaffar
cursed
aloud
the
bundles
had
been
tied
up
with
scrupulous
care
lest
the
money
should
fall
out
and
it
was
hard
to
lose
all
after
years
of
toil
he
tugged
desperately
at
the
would
not
come
untied
he
drew
his
sword
and
cut
fiercely
at
them
bars
of
gold
fell
out
he
seized
as
much
as
he
could
hold
in
his
hands
and
turned
to
fly
some
men
were
on
the
shore
with
madar
hallooing
to
him
he
could
not
hear
their
words
but
he
thought
they
pointed
to
a
rock
higher
than
the
rest
he
got
upon
it
or
in
another
instant
the
roaring
flood
would
have
overwhelmed
him
he
was
safe
for
a
minute
the
waters
were
rising
gradually
but
fearfully
fast
he
clutched
the
rock
he
screamed
he
prayed
wildly
the
rush
of
the
boiling
waters
appeared
to
increase
his
brain
grew
dizzy
then
he
tried
to
scramble
up
stand
upright
in
attempting
this
his
foot
slipped
those
on
the
bank
saw
him
toss
his
arms
wildly
into
the
air
and
the
next
instant
he
was
gone
the
fearful
tide
rolled
on
in
its
majesty
but
there
was
no
sign
of
a
living
thing
upon
its
turbid
waters
herbert
did
not
long
wait
at
bangalore
letters
to
england
had
now
preceded
him
more
than
a
month
they
had
gone
in
a
ship
of
war
which
was
some
guarantee
for
their
safe
arrival
there
was
danger
on
the
seas
but
he
thought
not
of
that
was
before
him
more
vividly
than
it
is
possible
for
us
to
paint
the
days
seemed
to
pass
as
weeks
as
the
gallant
fleet
sailed
along
for
home
bounded
their
prospect
ere
five
months
had
passed
they
anchored
at
the
nore

dalton
and

were
soon
to
follow
it
was
on
a
bright
warm
day
early
in
december
that
a
travelling
carriage
with
four
horses
was
seen
driving
at
desperate
speed
into
the
town
it
stopped
at
the
inn
horses
on
to
my
father
alston
cried
a
gentleman
within
quick
quick
the
landlord
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
it
was
not
compton
s
son
the
clergyman
no
this
was
a
darker
taller
handsomer
person
than
him
he
looked
again
and
then
exclaimed
it
can
not
be
it
can
not
be
captain
compton
yes
i
am
he
was
the
reply
but
pray
be
quick
hurrah
cried
the
jolly
landlord
throwing
up
his
cap
into
the
air
hurrah
for
the
captain
three
cheers
for
captain
compton
and
god
bless
him
you
shall
have
a
barrel
of
ale
my
lads
for
this
joy
i
little
thought
to
have
ever
seen
you
alive
again
thank
you
thank
you
said
herbert
i
will
come
soon
and
see
you
now
drive
on
boys
at
full
speed
and
away
they
dashed
an
anxious
party
was
assembled
that
day
at
the
old
rectory
in
trembling
expectation
of
the
sound
of
wheels
all
felt
nervous
and
agitated
and
some
laughed
and
cried
by
turns
poor
amy
it
is
difficult
to
describe
her
feelings
of
joy
of
silent
thankfulness
her
beauty
was
more
radiant
than
ever
the
purity
of
her
complexion
with
the
exquisite
expression
of
her
eyes
was
more
striking
far
more
than
that
of
the
lively
and
joyous
girl
of
six
years
ago
there
was
one
who
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
long
before
the
was
amy
the
others
watched
her
her
face
which
had
been
flushed
and
deadly
pale
by
turns
was
lighted
up
on
a
sudden
with
a
joy
so
intense
that
they
almost
feared
for
the
consequences
on
a
sudden
she
appeared
to
listen
more
earnestly
then
she
arose
but
no
one
followed
her
she
went
to
the
door
passed
into
the
hall
seemed
to
gaze
vacantly
around
returned
sank
into
a
chair
and
pressing
her
hand
to
her
heart
panted
for
breath
soon
after
a
carriage
at
full
speed
dashed
past
the
house
a
man
opened
the
out
almost
ere
it
had
with
breathless
haste
into
the
a
crowd
of
servants
who
were
sobbing
with
joy
and
in
another
instant
he
was
in
the
room
amy
sprang
to
meet
him
with
outstretched
arms
and
uttering
a
low
cry
of
joy
threw
herself
into
his
embrace
and
was
strained
to
his
heart
in
silent
rapture
others
hung
round
him
sobbing
too
but
their
tears
were
those
of
joy
and
gratitude
the
past
was
even
then
forgotten
for
they
beheld
their
herbert
safe
and
knew
as
he
pressed
to
his
the
faithful
heart
which
had
so
long
loved
him
that
their
past
sorrow
would
soon
be
turned
into
rejoicing
