my

world
delights
he
throws
upon
the
gross

baser
slaves
to

to
wealth
to

i
pine
and
die
with
all
these
living
in

berowne
i
can
but
say
their
protestation
over
so
much
dear
liege
i
have
already
sworn
that
is
to
live
and
study
here
three
years
but
there
are
other
strict
observances
as
not
to
see
a
woman
in
that
term
which
i
hope
well
is
not
enrolled
there
and
one
day
in
a
week
to
touch
no
food
and
but
one
meal
on
every
day
beside
the
which
i
hope
is
not
enrolled
there
and
then
to
sleep
but
three
hours
in
the
night
and
not
be
seen
to
wink
of
all
the
when
i
was
wont
to
think
no
harm
all
night
and
make
a
dark
night
too
of
half
the
which
i
hope
well
is
not
enrolled
there
o
these
are
barren
tasks
too
hard
to
keep
not
to
see
ladies
study
fast
not
sleep
king
your
oath
is
pass
to
pass
away
from
these
berowne
let
me
say
no
my
liege
an
if
you
please
i
only
swore
to
study
with
your
grace
and
stay
here
in
your
court
for
three
years
space
longaville
you
swore
to
that
berowne
and
to
the
rest
berowne
by
yea
and
nay
sir
then
i
swore
in
jest
what
is
the
end
of
study
let
me
know
king
why
that
to
know
which
else
we
should
not
know
berowne
things
hid
and
barr
you
mean
from
common
sense
king
ay
that
is
study
recompense
berowne
come
on
then
i
will
swear
to
study
so
to
know
the
thing
i
am
forbid
to
know
as
thus
to
study
where
i
well
may
dine
when
i
to
feast
expressly
am
forbid
or
study
where
to
meet
some
mistress
fine
when
mistresses
from
common
sense
are
hid
or
having
sworn
too
oath
study
to
break
it
and
not
break
my
troth
if
study
gain
be
thus
and
this
be
so
study
knows
that
which
yet
it
doth
not
know
swear
me
to
this
and
i
will
say
no
king
these
be
the
stops
that
hinder
study
quite
and
train
our
intellects
to
vain
delight
berowne
why
all
delights
are
vain
but
that
most
vain
which
with
pain
purchas
doth
inherit
pain
as
painfully
to
pore
upon
a
book
to
seek
the
light
of
truth
while
truth
the
while
doth
falsely
blind
the
eyesight
of
his
look
light
seeking
light
doth
light
of
light
beguile
so
ere
you
find
where
light
in
darkness
lies
your
light
grows
dark
by
losing
of
your
eyes
study
me
how
to
please
the
eye
indeed
by
fixing
it
upon
a
fairer
eye
who
dazzling
so
that
eye
shall
be
his
heed
and
give
him
light
that
it
was
blinded
by
study
is
like
the
heaven
glorious
sun
that
will
not
be
with
saucy
looks
small
have
continual
plodders
ever
won
save
base
authority
from
others
books
these
earthly
godfathers
of
heaven
lights
that
give
a
name
to
every
fixed
star
have
no
more
profit
of
their
shining
nights
than
those
that
walk
and
wot
not
what
they
are
too
much
to
know
is
to
know
nought
but
fame
and
every
godfather
can
give
a
name
king
how
well
he
read
to
reason
against
reading
dumain
proceeded
well
to
stop
all
good
proceeding
longaville
he
weeds
the
corn
and
still
lets
grow
the

berowne
the

in

nothing
berowne
something
then
in

longaville
berowne
is

envious
sneaping
frost

berowne
well

i
am
why

proud

boast

have
any

have
sworn
to
stay
with
you

though
i
have
for
barbarism
spoke
more
than
for
that
angel
knowledge
you
can
say
yet
confident
i
keep
what
i
have
swore
and
bide
the
penance
of
each
three
years
day
give
me
the
paper
let
me
read
the
same
and
to
the
strictest
decrees
i
write
my
name
king
how
well
this
yielding
rescues
thee
from
shame
berowne
reads
that
no
woman
shall
come
within
a
mile
of
my
hath
this
been
proclaimed
longaville
four
days
ago
berowne
let
see
the
penalty
reads
pain
of
losing
her
tongue
who
devis
this
penalty
longaville
marry
that
did
berowne
sweet
lord
and
why
longaville
to
fright
them
hence
with
that
dread
penalty
berowne
a
dangerous
law
against
gentility
reads
if
any
man
be
seen
to
talk
with
a
woman
within
the
term
of
three
years
he
shall
endure
such
public
shame
as
the
rest
of
the
court
can
possibly
devise
this
article
my
liege
yourself
must
break
for
well
you
know
here
comes
in
embassy
the
french
king
daughter
with
yourself
to
a
mild
of
grace
and
complete
about
surrender
up
of
aquitaine
to
her
decrepit
sick
and
bedrid
father
therefore
this
article
is
made
in
vain
or
vainly
comes
th
admired
princess
hither
king
what
say
you
lords
why
this
was
quite
forgot
berowne
so
study
evermore
is
while
it
doth
study
to
have
what
it
would
it
doth
forget
to
do
the
thing
it
should
and
when
it
hath
the
thing
it
hunteth
most
is
won
as
towns
with
so
won
so
lost
king
we
must
of
force
dispense
with
this
decree
she
must
lie
here
on
mere
necessity
berowne

make
us
all
forsworn
three
thousand
times
within
this
three
years
space
for
every
man

his
affects
is
born
not
by
might
but
by
special
grace
if
i
break
faith
this
word
shall
speak
for
me
i
am
forsworn
on
mere
necessity
so
to
the
laws
at
large
i
write
my
name
subscribes
and
he
that
breaks
them
in
the
least
degree
stands
in
attainder
of
eternal
shame
suggestions
are
to
other
as
to
me
but
i
believe
although
i
seem
so
loath
i

doth
catch
the

his

one
part

not
valued

that
one
half
which
is
unsatisfied
we
will
give
up
our
right
in

that
it
seems
he
little
purposeth
for
here
he
doth
demand

his
title
live
in

which
we
much
rather
had
depart
withal

nathaniel
very
reverent
sport
truly
and
done
in
the
testimony
of
a
good

holofernes
the

was
as
you
know

ripe
as
the

who
now
hangeth
like
a

in

nathaniel
truly
master
holofernes
the

sir
i
assure
ye
it
was
a
buck
of
the
first
head
holofernes
sir
nathaniel
haud
credo
dull
was
not
a
haud
credo
was
a

holofernes
most
barbarous
intimation
yet
a

of
insinuation
as
it
were
in

in

of

it
were
replication

rather
ostentare

were
his
inclination
after
his
undressed
unpolished
uneducated
unpruned
untrained
or
rather
unlettered
or
ratherest
unconfirmed
fashion
to
insert
again
my
haud
credo
for
a

dull
i
said
the

he
hath
not

he
hath
not
drunk

his
intellect
is
not
replenished
he
is
only
an
animal
only
sensible
in
the
duller
parts
and
such
barren
plants
are
set
before
us
that
we
thankful

more

for
as
it
would
ill
become
me
to
be
vain
indiscreet

a

so
were
there
a

set
on

you
would
for

break
faith

jove
for

would
infringe
an

what
will
berowne
say

triumph
leap

what

they
quoth

dares

what

what

hath
inspir
thee
now
my

her

is
a

she
an

scarce

berowne
my

no

but
for
my

day
would
turn
to
night
of
all
complexions
the
cull

do
meet
as
at
a

several

where
nothing

that
want

thy

is
black
as

is

of

o
who

black
is
the

it
mourns
that
painting
and
usurping
hair
should
ravish
doters
with
a
false
aspect
and
therefore
is
she
born
to
make
black
fair
her
favour
turns
the
fashion
of
the
days
for
native
blood
is
counted
painting
now
and
therefore
red
that
would
avoid
dispraise
paints
itself
black
to
imitate
her

dumain
to
look
like
her
are
black
longaville
and
since
her
time
are
colliers
counted
bright
king
and
ethiopes
of
their
sweet

crack
dumain
dark
needs
no
candles
now
for
dark
is
light
berowne
your
mistresses
dare
never
come
in

for
fear
their
colours
should
be
wash
away
king
good
yours
did
for
sir
to
tell
you
plain
i
find
a
fairer
face
not
wash
berowne
i
prove
her
fair
or
talk
till
doomsday
here
king
no
devil
will
fright
thee
then
so
much
as
she
dumain
i
never
knew
man
hold
vile
stuff
so
dear
longaville
look
here
thy
love
my
foot
and
her
face
see
showing
his
shoe
berowne
o
if
the
streets
were
paved
with
thine
eyes
her
feet
were
much
too
dainty
for
such
tread
dumain
o
vile
then
as
she
goes
what
upward
lies
the
street
should
see
as
she
walk
overhead
king
but
what
of
this
are
we
not
all
in
love
berowne
nothing
so
sure
and
thereby
all
forsworn
king
then
leave
this
chat
and
good
berowne
now
prove
our
loving
lawful
and
our
faith
not
torn
dumain
ay
marry
there
some
flattery
for
this
evil
longaville
o
some
authority
how
to
proceed
some
tricks
some
quillets
how
to
cheat
the
devil
dumain
some
salve
for
perjury
berowne
is
more
than
need
have
at
you
then
affection
consider
what
you
first
did
swear
unto
to
fast
to
study
and
to
see
no
flat
treason
the
kingly
state
of
youth
say
can
you
fast
your
stomachs
are
too
young
and
abstinence
engenders
maladies
and
where
that
you
you
have
vow
to
study
lords
in
that
each
of
you
have
forsworn
his
book
can
you
still
dream
and
pore
and
thereon
look
for
when
would
you
my
lord
or
you
or
you
have
found
the
ground
of
study
excellence
without
the
beauty
of
a
woman
face
from
women
eyes
this
doctrine
i
derive
they
are
the
ground
the
books
the
academes
from
whence
doth
spring
the
true
promethean
fire
why
universal
plodding
poisons
up
the
nimble
spirits
in
the
arteries
as
motion
and
action
tires
the
sinewy
vigour
of
the
traveller
now
for
not
looking
on
a
woman
face
you
have
in
that
forsworn
the
use
of
eyes
and
study
too
the
causer
of
your
vow
for
where
is
author
in
the
world
teaches
such
beauty
as
a
woman
eye
learning
is
but
an
adjunct
to
ourself
and
where
we
are
our
learning
likewise
is
then
when
ourselves
we
see
in
ladies
eyes
with
ourselves
do
we
not
likewise
see
our
learning
there
o
we
have
made
a
vow
to
study
lords
and
in
that
vow
we
have
forsworn
our
books
for
when
would
you
my
liege
or
you
or
you
in
leaden
contemplation
have
found
out
such
fiery
numbers
as
the
prompting
eyes
of
beauty
tutors
have
enrich
you
with
other
slow
arts
entirely
keep
the
brain
and
therefore
finding
barren
practisers
scarce
show
a
harvest
of
their
heavy
toil
but
love
first
learned
in
a
lady
eyes
lives
not
alone
immured
in
the
brain
but
with
the
motion
of
all
elements
courses
as
swift
as
thought
in
every
power
and
gives
to
every
power
a
double
power
above
their
functions
and
their
offices
it
adds
a
precious
seeing
to
the
eye
a
lover
eyes
will
gaze
an
eagle
blind
a
lover
ear
will
hear
the
lowest
sound
when
the
suspicious
head
of
theft
is
stopp
love
feeling
is
more
soft
and
sensible
than
are
the

of

for
his
dear
hold
take
thou
this
my
sweet
and
give
me
thine
so
shall
berowne
take
me
for
rosaline
and
change
you
favours
too
so
shall
your
loves
woo
contrary
deceiv
by
these
removes
rosaline
come
on
then
wear
the
favours
most
in
sight
katharine
but
in
this
changing
what
is
your
intent
princess
of
france
the
effect
of
my
intent
is
to
cross
theirs
they
do
it
but
in
mocking
merriment
and
mock
for
mock
is
only
my
intent
their
several
counsels
they
unbosom
shall
to
loves
mistook
and
so
be
mock
withal
upon
the
next
occasion
that
we
meet
with
visages
display
to
talk
and
greet
rosaline
but
shall
we
dance
if
they
desire
us
princess
of
france
no
to
the
death
we
will
not
move
a
foot
nor
to
their
penn
speech
render
we
no
grace
but
while
is
spoke
each
turn
away
her
face
boyet
why
that
contempt
will
kill
the
speaker
heart
and
quite
divorce
his
memory
from
his
part
princess

france
therefore
i
do
it
and
i
make
no
doubt
the
rest

come
in
if
he
be
out
there
no
such
sport
as
sport
by
sport
to
make
theirs
ours
and
ours
none
but
our
own
so
shall
we
stay
mocking
intended

in
that
hour
my
lord
they
did
not
bless
us
with
one
happy
word
i
dare
not
call
them
fools
but
this
i
think
when
they
are
thirsty
fools

fain
have
drink
berowne
this
jest
is
dry
to
me
fair
gentle
sweet
your
wit
makes
wise
things
foolish
when
we
greet
with
eyes
best
seeing
heaven
fiery
eye
by
light
we
lose
light
your
capacity
is
of
that
nature
that
to
your
huge
store
wise
things
seem
foolish
and
rich
things
but
poor
rosaline
this
proves
you
wise
and
rich
for
in
my
berowne
i
am
a
fool
and
full
of
poverty
rosaline
but
that
you
take
what
doth
to
you
belong
it
were
a
fault
to
snatch
words
from
my
tongue
berowne
o
i
am
yours
and
all
that
i
possess
rosaline
all
the
fool
mine
berowne

give
you
less
rosaline

of
the

that
superfluous

the
worse
and
show
the
better
face

were
descried
they
mock
us
now
downright
dumain
let
us
confess
and
turn
it
to
a
jest

my

highness
sad
rosaline
help
hold
his

swoon
why

pale
i
think
coming
from
muscovy
berowne
thus
pour
the
stars
down
plagues
for
perjury
can
any
face
of
brass
hold
longer
out
here
stand
i
dart
thy
skill
at
me
bruise
me
with
scorn
confound
me
with
a
flout
thrust
thy
sharp
wit
quite
through
my
ignorance
cut
me
to
pieces
with
thy
keen
conceit
and
i
will
wish
thee
never
more
to
dance
nor
never
more
in
russian
habit
wait
o
never
will
i
trust
to
speeches
penn
nor
to
the
motion
of
a
tongue
nor
never
come
in
vizard
to
my
friend
nor
woo
in
rhyme
like
a
blind
harper
song
taffeta
phrases
silken
terms
precise
hyperboles
spruce
affectation
figures
these
have
blown
me
full
of
maggot
ostentation
i
do
forswear
them
and
i
here
protest
by
this
white
how
white
the
hand
god
knows
henceforth
my
wooing
mind
shall
be
in
russet
yeas

these
badges
understand
the
king
for
your
fair
sakes
have
we
neglected
time
play
foul
play
with
our
oaths
your
beauty
ladies
hath
much
deformed
us
fashioning
our
humours
even
to
the
opposed
end
of
our
intents
and
what
in
us
hath
seem
ridiculous
as
love
is
full
of
unbefitting
strains
all
wanton
as
a
child
skipping
and
vain
form
by
the
eye
and
therefore
like
the
eye
full
of
strange
shapes
of
habits
and
of
forms
varying
in
subjects
as
the
eye
doth
roll
to
every
varied
object
in
his
glance
which
presence
of
loose
love
put
on
by
us
if
in
your
heavenly
eyes
have
misbecom
our
oaths
and
gravities
those
heavenly
eyes
that
look
into
these
faults
suggested
us
to
make
therefore
ladies
our
love
being
yours
the
error
that
love
makes
is
likewise
yours
we
to
ourselves
prove
false
by
being
once
false
for
ever
to
be
true
to
those
that
make
us
fair
ladies
you
and
even
that
falsehood
in
itself
a
sin
thus
purifies
itself
and
turns
to
grace
princess
of
france
we
have
receiv
your
letters
full
of
love
your
favours
the
ambassadors
of
love
and
in
our
maiden
council
rated
them
at
courtship
pleasant
jest
and
courtesy
as
bombast
and
as
lining
to
the
time
but
more
devout
than
this
in
our
respects
have
we
not
been
and
therefore
met
your
loves
in
their
own
fashion
like
a
merriment
dumain
our
letters
madam
show
much
more
than
jest
longaville
so
did
our
looks
rosaline
we
did
not
quote
them
so
king
now
at
the
latest
minute
of
the
hour
grant
us
your
loves
princess
of
france
a
time
methinks
too
short
to
make
a
bargain
in
no
no
my
lord
your
grace
is
perjur
much
full
of
dear
guiltiness
and
therefore
this
if
for
my
love
as
there
is
no
such
cause
you
will
do
this
shall
you
do
for
me
your
oath
i
will
not
trust
but
go
with
speed
to
some
forlorn
and
naked
hermitage
remote
from
all
the
pleasures
of
the
world
there
stay
until
the
twelve
celestial
signs
have
brought
about
the
annual
reckoning
if
this
austere
insociable
life
change
not
your
offer
made
in
heat
of
blood
if
frosts
and
fasts
hard
lodging
and
thin
weeds
nip
not
the
gaudy
blossoms
of
your
love
but
that
it
bear
this
trial
and
last
love
then
at
the
expiration
of
the
year
come
challenge
me
challenge
me
by
these
deserts
and
by
this
virgin
palm
now
kissing
thine
i
will
be
thine
and
till
that
instant
shut
my
woeful
self
up
in
a
mournful
house
raining
the
tears
of
lamentation
for
the
remembrance
of
my
father
death
if
this
thou
do
deny
let
our
hands
part
neither
intitled
in
the
other
heart
king
if
this
or
more
than
this
i
would
deny
to
flatter
up
these
powers
of
mine
with
rest
the
sudden
hand
of
death
close
up
mine
eye
hence
hermit

my
heart
is
in
thy
breast
berowne
and
what
to

what
to
me
rosaline
you
must
he
purged
too
your
sins
are
rack
you
are
attaint
with
faults
and
perjury
therefore
if
you

favour

get
a
twelvemonth
shall
you
spend
and
never
rest
but
seek
the
weary
beds
of

you
and
the

large
tongue
proclaims
you
for
a
man
replete
with
mocks
full
of
comparisons
and
wounding
flouts
which
you
on
all
estates
will
execute
that
lie
within
the
mercy
of
your
wit
to
weed
this
wormwood
from
your
fruitful
brain
and
therewithal
to
win
me
if
you
please
without
the
which
i
am
not
to

won
you
shall
this
twelvemonth
term
from
day
to
day
visit
the
speechless
sick
and
still
converse
with
groaning
wretches
and
your
task
shall
be
with
all
the
fierce
endeavour
of
your
wit
to
enforce
the
pained
impotent
to
smile
berowne
to
move
wild
laughter
in
the
throat
of
death
it
can
not
be
it
is
impossible
mirth
can
not
move
a
soul
in
agony
rosaline
why
that
the
way
to
choke
a
gibing
spirit
whose
influence
is
begot
of
that
loose
grace
which
shallow
laughing
hearers
give
to
fools
a
jest
prosperity
lies
in
the
ear
of
him
that
hears
it
never
in
the
tongue
of
him
that
makes
it
then
if
sickly
ears
deaf
with
the
clamours
of
their
own
dear
groans
will
hear
your
idle
scorns
continue
then
and
i
will
have
you
and
that
fault
withal
but
if
they
will
not
throw
away
that
spirit
