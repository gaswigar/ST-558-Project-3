the

of

forming
one
of
the

called

such

alone
who
by
the
sympathy
of
a
social
taste
fall
in
with
any
blameless
fashion
of
the
day
and
from
an
amiable
interest
also
in
whatever
may
chance
to
afford
them
innocent
pleasure
would
fain
know
something
more
about
an
author
whose
works
have
brought
them
that
gratification
than
the
cold
letter
of
a
mere
literary
preface
usually
tells
to
such
readers
this
something
of
an
egotistical
epistle
is
addressed
for
in
beginning
the
republication
of
a
regular
series
of
the
novels
or
as
they
have
been
more
properly
called
biographical
romances
of
which
i
have
been
the
author
it
has
been
considered
desirable
to
make
certain
additions
to
each
work
in
the
form
of
a
few
introductory
pages
and
scattered
notes
illustrative
of
the
origin
of
the
tale
of
the
historical
events
referred
to
in
it
and
of
the
actually
living
characters
who
constitute
its
personages
with
some
account
also
of
the
really
local
scenery
described
thus
giving
it
is
thought
a
double
zest
to
the
entertainment
of
the
reader
by
bringing
him
into
a
previous
acquaintance
with
the
persons
he
is
to
meet
in
the
book
and
making
him
agreeably
familiar
with
the
country
through
which
he
is
to
travel
in
their
company
indeed
the
social
taste
of
the
times
has
lately
fully
shown
how
advantageous
the
like
conversational
disclosures
have
proved
to
the
recent
republications
of
the
celebrated
waverley
novels
by
the
chief
of
and
in
the
new
series
of
the
admirable
naval
tales
by
the
distinguished
american
novelist
both
of
whom
paid
to
the
country
the
gratifying
tribute
of
making
it
their
birthplace
such
evidences
in
favor
of
an
argument
could
not
fail
to
persuade
me
to
undertake
the
desired
elucidating
task
feeling
indeed
particularly
pleased
to
adopt
in
my
turn
a
successful
example
from
the
once
great
unknown
now
the
not
less
great
avowed
author
of
the
waverley
novels
in
the
person
of
sir
walter
scott
who
did
me
the
honor
to
adopt
the
style
or
class
of
novel
of
which
thaddeus
of
warsaw
was
the
first
a
class
which
uniting
the
personages
and
facts
of
real
history
or
biography
with
a
combining
and
illustrative
machinery
of
the
imagination
formed
a
new
species
of
writing
in
that
day
and
to
which
madame
de
staël
and
others
have
given
the
appellation
of
an
epic
in
prose
the
day
of
its
appearance
is
now
pretty
far
back
for
thaddeus
of
warsaw
a
tale
founded
on
polish
heroism
and
the
scottish
chiefs
a
romance
grounded
on
scottish
heroism
were
both
published
in
england
and
translated
into
various
languages
abroad
many
years
before
the
literary
wonder
of
scotland
gave
to
the
world
his
transcendent
story
of
waverley
forming
a
most
impressive
historical
picture
of
the
last
struggle
of
the
papist
but
gallant
branch
of
the
stuarts
for
the
british
throne
footnote
it
was
on
the
publication
of
these
her
first
two
works
in
the
german
language
that
the
authoress
was
honored
with
being
made
a
lady
of
the
chapter
of
joachim
and
received
the
gold
cross
of
the
order
from
wirtemburg
thaddeus
of
warsaw
being
the
first
essay
in
the
form
of
such
an
association
between
fact
and
fancy
was
published
by
its
author
with
a
natural
apprehension
of
its
reception
by
the
critical
part
of
the
public
she
had
not
indeed
written
it
with
any
view
to
publication
but
from
an
almost
resistless
impulse
to
embody
the
ideas
and
impressions
with
which
her
heart
and
mind
were
then
full
it
was
written
in
her
earliest
youth
dictated
by
a
fervent
sympathy
with
calamities
which
had
scarcely
ceased
to
exist
and
which
her
eager
pen
sought
to
portray
and
it
was
given
to
the
world
or
rather
to
those
who
might
feel
with
her
with
all
the
enthusiasm
which
saw
no
impediment
when
a
tale
of
virtue
or
of
pity
was
to
be
told
in
looking
back
through
the
avenue
of
life
to
that
time
what
events
have
occurred
public
and
private
to
the
countries
and
to
the
individuals
named
in
that
tale
to
persons
of
even
as
lofty
names
and
excellences
of
our
own
and
other
lands
who
were
mutually
affected
with
me
in
admiration
and
regret
for
the
virtues
and
the
sorrows
described
in
sitting
down
now
to
my
retrospective
task
i
find
myself
writing
this
my
second
preface
to
the
story
of
thaddeus
of
warsaw
just
thirty
years
from
the
date
of
its
first
publication
then
i
wrote
when
the
struggle
for
the
birthright
independence
of
poland
was
no
more
when
she
lay
in
her
ashes
and
her
heroes
in
their
wounds
when
the
pall
of
death
spread
over
the
whole
country
and
her
widows
and
orphans
travelled
afar
in
the
days
of
my
almost
childhood
that
is
eight
years
before
i
dipped
my
pen
in
their
tears
i
remember
seeing
many
of
those
hapless
refugees
wandering
about
james
park
they
had
sad
companions
in
the
like
miseries
though
from
different
enemies
in
the
emigrants
from
france
and
memory
can
never
forget
the
variety
of
wretched
yet
visages
i
then
contemplated
in
the
daily
walks
which
my
mother
own
little
family
group
were
accustomed
to
take
there
one
person
a
gaunt
figure
with
melancholy
and
bravery
stamped
on
his
emaciated
features
is
often
present
to
the
recollection
of
us
all
he
was
clad
in
a
threadbare
blue
uniform
great
coat
with
a
black
stock
a
rusty
old
hat
pulled
rather
over
his
eyes
his
hands
without
gloves
but
his
aspect
was
that
of
a
perfect
gentleman
and
his
step
that
of
a
military
man
we
saw
him
constantly
at
one
hour
in
the
middle
walk
of
the
mall
and
always
alone
never
looking
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
but
straight
on
with
an
unmoving
countenance
and
a
pace
which
told
that
his
thoughts
were
those
of
a
homeless
and
hopeless
man
hopeless
at
least
of
all
that
life
might
bring
him
on
on
he
went
to
the
end
of
the
mall
turned
again
and
on
again
and
so
he
continued
to
do
always
as
long
as
we
remained
spectators
of
his
solitary
walk
once
indeed
we
saw
him
crossing
into
martin
lane
nobody
seemed
to
know
him
for
he
spoke
to
none
and
no
person
ever
addressed
him
though
many
like
ourselves
looked
at
him
and
stopped
in
the
path
to
gaze
after
him
we
often
longed
to
be
rich
to
follow
him
wherever
his
wretched
abode
might
have
been
and
then
silently
to
send
comforts
to
him
from
hands
he
knew
not
of
we
used
to
call
him
when
speaking
of
him
to
ourselves
penseroso
and
by
that
name
we
yet
not
unfrequently
talk
of
him
to
each
other
and
never
without
recurrence
to
the
very
painful
because
unavailing
sympathy
we
then
felt
for
that
apparently
friendless
man
such
sympathy
is
indeed
right
for
it
is
one
of
the
secondary
means
by
which
providence
conducts
the
stream
of
his
mercies
to
those
who
need
the
succor
of
their
and
we
can
not
doubt
that
though
the
agency
of
such
providence
was
not
to
be
in
our
hands
there
were
those
who
had
both
the
will
and
the
power
given
and
did
not
like
ourselves
turn
and
pity
that
interesting
emigrant
in
vain
some
time
after
this
general
kosciusko
the
justly
celebrated
hero
of
poland
came
to
england
on
his
way
to
the
united
states
having
been
released
from
his
close
imprisonment
in
russia
and
in
the
noblest
manner
too
by
the
emperor
paul
immediately
on
his
accession
to
the
throne
his
arrival
caused
a
great
sensation
in
london
and
many
of
the
first
characters
of
the
times
pressed
forward
to
pay
their
respects
to
such
real
patriotic
virtue
in
its
adversity
an
old
friend
of
my
family
was
amongst
them
his
own
warm
heart
encouraging
the
enthusiasm
of
ours
he
took
my
brother
robert
to
visit
the
polish
veteran
then
lodging
at
sablonière
hotel
in
leicester
square
my
brother
on
his
return
to
us
described
him
as
a
noble
looking
man
though
not
at
all
handsome
lying
upon
a
couch
in
a
very
enfeebled
state
from
the
effects
of
numerous
wounds
he
had
received
in
his
breast
by
the
cossacks
lances
after
his
fall
having
been
previously
overthrown
by
a
sabre
stroke
on
his
head
his
voice
in
consequence
of
the
induced
internal
weakness
was
very
low
and
his
speaking
always
with
resting
intervals
he
wore
a
black
bandage
across
his
forehead
which
covered
a
deep
wound
there
and
indeed
his
whole
figure
bore
marks
of
long
suffering
our
friend
introduced
my
brother
to
him
by
name
and
as
a
boy
emulous
of
seeing
and
following
noble
examples
kosciusko
took
him
kindly
by
the
hand
and
spoke
to
him
words
of
generous
encouragement
in
whatever
path
of
virtuous
ambition
he
might
take
they
never
have
been
forgotten
is
it
then
to
be
wondered
at
combining
the
mute
distress
i
had
so
often
contemplated
in
other
victims
of
similar
misfortunes
with
the
magnanimous
object
then
described
to
me
by
my
brother
that
the
story
of
heroism
my
young
imagination
should
think
of
embodying
into
shape
should
be
founded
on
the
actual
scenes
of
kosciusko
sufferings
and
moulded
out
of
his
virtues
to
have
made
him
the
ostensible
hero
of
the
tale
would
have
suited
neither
the
modesty
of
his
feelings
nor
the
humbleness
of
my
own
expectation
of
telling
it
as
i
wished
i
therefore
took
a
younger
and
less
pretending
agent
in
the
personification
of
a
descendant
of
the
great
john
sobieski
but
it
was
as
i
have
already
said
some
years
after
the
partition
of
poland
that
i
wrote
and
gave
for
publication
my
historical
romance
on
that
catastrophe
it
was
finished
amid
a
circle
of
friends
well
calculated
to
fan
the
flame
which
had
inspired
its
commencement
some
of
the
leading
heroes
of
the
british
army
just
returned
from
the
victorious
fields
of
alexandria
and
jean
and
seated
in
my
brother
little
study
with
the
coat
in
which
the
veteran
abercrombie
breathed
his
last
grateful
sigh
while
like
wolfe
he
gazed
on
the
boasted
invincible
standard
of
the
enemy
brought
to
him
by
a
british
soldier
with
this
trophy
of
our
own
native
valor
on
one
side
of
me
and
on
the
other
the
vest
of
another
english
commander
of
as
many
battles
but
who
having
survived
to
enjoy
his
fame
i
do
not
name
here
i
put
my
last
stroke
to
the
first
campaigns
of
thaddeus
sobieski
when
the
work
was
finished
some
of
the
persons
near
me
urged
its
being
published
but
i
argued
in
opposition
to
the
wish
its
different
construction
to
all
other
novels
or
romances
which
had
gone
before
it
from
richardson
domestic
novels
to
the
penetrating
feeling
in
similar
scenes
by
the
pen
of
henry
mackenzie
and
again
charlotte
smith
more
recent
elegant
but
very
sentimental
love
stories
but
the
most
formidable
of
all
were
the
wildly
interesting
romances
of
anne
radcliffe
whose
magical
wonders
and
mysteries
were
then
the
ruling
style
of
the
day
i
urged
how
could
any
one
expect
that
the
admiring
readers
of
such
works
could
consider
my
biographical
legend
of
poland
anything
better
than
a
dull
union
between
real
history
and
a
imagination
arguments
were
found
to
answer
all
this
and
being
excited
by
the
feelings
which
had
dictated
my
little
work
and
encouraged
by
the
corresponding
characters
with
whom
i
daily
associated
i
ventured
the
essay
however
i
had
not
read
the
sage
romances
of
our
older
times
without
turning
to
some
account
the
lessons
they
taught
to
adventurous
personages
of
either
sex
showing
that
even
the
boldest
knight
never
made
a
new
sally
without
consecrating
his
shield
with
some
impress
of
acknowledged
reverence
in
like
manner
when
i
entered
the
field
with
my
modern
romance
of
thaddeus
of
warsaw
i
inscribed
the
first
page
with
the
name
of
the
hero
of
acre
that
dedication
will
be
found
through
all
its
successive
editions
still
in
front
of
the
and
immediately
following
it
is
a
second
inscription
added
in
after
years
to
the
memory
of
the
magnanimous
patriot
and
exemplary
man
thaddeus
kosciusko
who
had
first
filled
me
with
ambition
to
write
the
tale
and
who
died
in
switzerland
fuller
of
glory
than
of
years
yet
if
life
be
measured
by
its
vicissitudes
and
its
virtues
we
may
justly
say
he
was
gathered
in
his
ripeness
after
his
visit
to
old
friends
in
the
united
states
where
in
his
youth
he
had
learned
the
art
of
war
and
the
science
of
a
noble
unselfish
independence
from
the
marvel
of
modern
times
general
washington
kosciusko
returned
to
europe
and
abode
a
while
in
france
but
not
in
its
capital
he
lived
deeply
retired
gradually
restoring
his
shattered
frame
to
some
degree
of
health
by
the
peace
of
a
resigned
mind
and
the
occupation
of
rural
employments
circumstances
led
him
to
switzerland
and
the
country
of
william
tell
and
of
simple
christian
fellowship
could
not
but
soon
be
found
peculiarly
congenial
to
his
spirit
long
turned
away
from
the
pageants
and
the
pomp
of
this
world
in
his
span
he
had
had
all
either
in
his
grasp
or
proffered
to
him
for
when
nothing
remained
of
all
his
military
glory
and
his
patriotic
sacrifices
but
a
yet
existing
fame
and
a
conscious
sense
within
him
of
duty
performed
he
was
content
to
eat
his
crust
with
that
inheritance
alone
and
he
refused
though
with
an
answering
magnanimity
of
acknowledgment
a
valuable
property
offered
to
him
by
the
emperor
of
russia
as
a
free
gift
from
a
generous
enemy
esteeming
his
proved
disinterested
virtues
he
also
declined
the
yet
more
dazzling
present
of
a
crown
from
the
then
master
of
the
continent
who
would
have
set
him
on
the
throne
of
poland
but
of
a
truth
under
the
vassalage
of
the
emperor
of
the
french
kosciusko
was
not
to
be
consoled
for
poland
by
riches
bestowed
on
himself
nor
betrayed
into
compromising
her
birthright
of
national
independence
by
the
casuistry
that
would
have
made
his
parental
sceptre
the
instrument
of
a
foreign
domination
having
such
a
theme
as
his
name
and
the
heroes
his
the
romance
of
thaddeus
of
warsaw
was
no
sooner
published
than
it
overcame
the
novelty
of
its
construction
and
became
universally
popular
nor
was
it
very
long
before
it
fell
into
general
hands
though
then
in
a
distant
land
and
he
kindly
and
promptly
lost
no
time
in
letting
the
author
know
his
approbation
of
the
narrative
though
qualified
with
several
modest
expressions
respecting
himself
from
that
period
she
enjoyed
many
treasured
marks
of
his
esteem
and
she
will
add
though
with
a
sad
satisfaction
that
amongst
her
several
relics
of
the
great
departed
who
have
honored
her
with
regard
she
possesses
most
dearly
prized
a
medal
of
kosciusko
and
a
lock
of
his
hair
about
the
same
time
she
received
a
most
incontestable
proof
of
the
accuracy
of
her
story
from
the
lips
of
general
gardiner
the
last
british
minister
to
the
court
of
stanislaus
augustus
on
his
reading
the
book
he
was
so
sure
that
the
facts
it
represented
could
only
have
been
learned
on
the
spot
that
he
expressed
his
surprise
to
several
persons
that
the
author
of
the
work
an
english
lady
could
have
been
at
warsaw
during
all
the
troubles
there
and
he
not
know
it
on
his
repeating
this
observation
to
the
late
duke
of
roxburgh
his
grace
who
happened
to
overhear
what
was
said
and
knew
the
writer
answered
him
by
saying
the
author
has
never
been
in
poland
impossible
replied
the
general
no
one
could
describe
the
scenes
and
occurrences
there
in
the
manner
it
is
done
in
that
book
without
having
been
an
eyewitness
the
lady
however
convinced
the
general
of
the
fact
being
otherwise
by
assuring
him
from
her
own
personal
knowledge
that
the
author
of
thaddeus
of
warsaw
was
a
mere
in
england
at
the
time
of
the
events
of
the
story
how
then
it
has
often
been
asked
did
she
obtain
such
accurate
information
with
regard
to
those
events
and
how
acquire
her
familiar
acquaintance
with
the
palaces
and
persons
she
represents
in
the
work
the
answer
is
short
by
close
questioning
every
person
that
came
in
her
way
that
knew
anything
about
the
object
of
her
interest
and
there
were
many
brave
hearts
and
indignant
lips
ready
to
open
with
the
sad
yet
noble
tale
thus
every
illustrious
individual
she
wished
to
bring
into
her
narrative
gradually
grew
upon
her
knowledge
till
she
became
as
well
acquainted
with
all
her
desired
personages
as
if
they
were
actually
present
with
her
for
she
knew
their
minds
and
their
actions
and
these
compose
the
man
the
features
of
the
country
also
were
learned
from
persons
who
had
trodden
the
spots
she
describes
and
that
they
were
indeed
correct
pictures
of
their
homes
and
the
tears
and
bursting
enthusiasm
of
many
of
poland
long
expatriated
sons
have
more
than
once
borne
testimony
to
her
as
one
instance
out
of
the
number
i
might
repeat
of
the
inextinguishable
love
of
those
noble
wanderers
from
their
native
country
i
shall
subjoin
the
copy
of
a
letter
addressed
to
me
by
one
of
those
gallant
men
then
holding
a
high
military
post
in
a
foreign
service
and
who
i
afterwards
learned
was
of
the
family
of
kosciusko
whose
portrait
he
sent
to
me
for
the
letter
was
accompanied
with
a
ring
of
pure
gold
containing
a
likeness
of
that
hero
the
letter
was
in
french
and
i
transcribe
it
literally
in
the
words
of
the
writer

probably
the
writer
of
the
above
is
now
returned
to
his
country
his
vows
having
been
most
awfully
answered
by
one
of
the
most
momentous
struggles
she
has
ever
had
or
to
which
the
nations
around
have
ever
yet
stood
as
spectators
for
the
balance
of
europe
trembles
at
the
turning
of
her
scale
thus
then
it
can
not
but
be
that
in
the
conclusion
of
this
my
perhaps
last
introductory
preface
to
any
new
edition
of
thaddeus
of
warsaw
its
author
should
offer
up
a
sincerely
heartfelt
prayer
to
the
king
of
kings
the
almighty
father
of
all
mankind
that
his
gracious
spirit
may
watch
over
the
issue
of
this
contest
and
dictate
the
peace
of
poland
esher
dedication
to
the
first
edition
thaddeus
of
warsaw
is
inscribed
to
sir
sidney
smith
in
the
hope
that
as
sir
philip
sidney
did
not
disdain
to
write
a
romance
sir
sidney
smith
will
not
refuse
to
read
one
sir
philip
sidney
consigned
his
excellent
work
to
the
affection
of
a
sister
i
confide
my
aspiring
attempt
to
the
urbanity
of
the
brave
to
the
man
of
taste
of
feeling
and
of
candor
to
him
whose
friendship
will
bestow
that
indulbence
on
the
author
which
his
judgment
might
have
denied
to
the
book
to
him
of
whom
future
ages
will
speak
with
honor
and
the
present
times
boast
as
their
glory
to
sir
sidney
smith
i
submit
this
humble
tribute
of
the
highest
respect
which
can
be
offered
by
a
briton
or
animate
the
heart
of
his
sincere
friend
the
author
preface
to
the
first
edition
having
attempted
a
narrative
of
the
intended
description
but
written
in
fact
from
the
mere
impulse
of
sympathy
with
its
subject
still
fresh
in
my
own
and
every
pitying
memory
it
is
natural
that
after
having
made
up
my
mind
to
assent
to
its
publication
in
which
much
time
and
thought
has
been
expended
in
considering
the
responsibility
of
so
doing
from
so
unpractised
a
pen
i
should
feel
an
increase
of
anxiety
respecting
its
ultimate
fate
therefore
before
the
reader
favors
the
tale
itself
with
his
attention
i
beg
leave
to
offer
him
a
little
account
of
the
principles
that
actuated
its
composition
and
in
regard
to
which
one
of
the
most
honored
heads
in
the
author
family
urged
her
not
to
withhold
it
from
the
press
observing
in
his
persuasions
that
the
mistakes
which
many
of
my
young
contemporaries
of
both
sexes
continually
make
in
their
estimates
of
human
character
and
of
the
purposes
of
human
life
require
to
have
a
line
of
difference
between
certain
splendid
vices
and
some
of
the
brilliant
order
of
virtues
to
be
distinctly
drawn
before
them
and
he
remarked
it
appeared
to
be
so
done
in
the
pages
of
my
polish
manuscript
therefore
added
he
let
thaddeus
of
warsaw
speak
openly
for
himself
this
opinion
decided
me
though
with
fear
and
trembling
yet
i
felt
an
encouraging
consciousness
that
in
writing
the
manuscript
narrative
for
my
own
private
enjoyment
only
and
the
occasional
amusement
of
those
friends
dearest
around
me
i
had
wished
to
portray
characters
whose
high
endowments
could
not
be
misled
into
proud
ambitions
nor
the
gift
of
dazzling
social
graces
betray
into
the
selfish
triumphs
of
worldly
vanity
characters
that
prosperity
could
not
inflate
nor
disappointments
depress
from
pious
trust
and
honorable
action
the
pure
fires
of
such
a
spirit
declare
their
sacred
origin
and
such
is
the
talisman
of
those
achievements
which
amaze
everybody
but
their
accomplisher
the
eye
fixed
on
it
is
what
divine
truth
declares
it
to
be
single
there
is
no
double
purpose
in
it
no
glancing
to
a
own
personal
aggrandizement
on
one
side
and
on
professing
services
to
his
on
the
other
such
a
spirit
has
only
one
aim
heaven
and
the
eternal
records
of
that
wide
firmament
include
within
it
all
good
to
man
what
flattered
alexander
of
macedon
into
a
madman
and
perverted
the
julius
caesar
into
usurpation
and
tyranny
has
also
been
found
by
christian
heroes
the
most
perilous
ordeal
of
their
virtue
but
inasmuch
as
they
are
christian
heroes
and
not
pagan
men
worshippers
of
false
gods
whose
fabled
examples
inculcated
all
these
deeds
of
our
heroes
of
a
better
revelation
have
no
excuse
for
failing
under
their
trial
and
many
there
be
who
pass
through
it
pure
and
undefiled
such
were
the
great
alfred
of
england
gustavus
vasa
of
sweden
and
his
greater
successor
in
true
glory
gustavus
adolphus
all
champions
of
immutable
justice
and
ministers
of
peace
and
though
these
may
be
regarded
as
personages
beyond
the
sphere
of
ordinary
emulations
yet
the
same
principles
or
their
opposites
prevail
in
every
order
of
men
from
the
prince
to
the
peasant
and
perhaps
at
no
period
of
the
world
more
than
the
present
were
these
divers
principles
in
greater
necessity
to
be
considered
and
according
to
the
just
conclusion
be
obeyed
on
all
sides
of
us
we
see
public
and
private
society
broken
up
as
it
were
by
an
earthquake
the
noblest
and
the
meanest
passions
of
the
human
bosom
at
contention
and
the
latter
often
so
disguised
that
the
vile
ambuscade
is
not
even
suspected
till
found
within
the
heart
of
the
fortress
itself
we
have
however
one
veritable
touchstone
that
of
the
truest
observation
ye
shall
know
a
tree
by
its
fruits
let
us
look
round
then
for
those
which
bear
good
fruits
wholesome
to
the
taste
as
well
as
pleasant
to
the
sight
whether
they
grow
on
high
altitudes
or
in
the
humbler
valleys
of
the
earth
let
us
view
men
of
all
degrees
in
life
in
their
actions
and
not
in
their
pretensions
such
men
as
were
some
of
the
sobieski
race
in
poland
in
every
change
of
their
remarkable
lives
when
placed
at
the
summit
of
mortal
fame
surrounded
by
greatness
and
glory
and
consequent
power
they
evinced
neither
pride
to
others
nor
a
sense
of
in
themselves
and
when
under
a
reverse
dispensation
national
misfortunes
pursued
them
and
family
sorrows
pierced
their
souls
the
weakness
of
a
murmur
never
sunk
the
dignity
of
their
sustaining
fortitude
nor
did
the
firmness
of
that
virtue
harden
the
amiable
sensibilities
of
their
hearts
to
exhibit
so
truly
heroic
and
endearing
a
portrait
of
what
every
christian
man
ought
to
be
for
the
law
of
god
is
the
same
to
the
poor
as
to
the
rich
i
have
chosen
one
of
that
illustrious
and
i
believe
now
extinct
race
for
the
subject
of
my
sketch
and
the
more
aptly
did
it
present
itself
it
being
necessary
to
show
my
hero
amidst
scenes
and
circumstances
ready
to
exercise
his
brave
and
generous
propensities
and
to
put
their
personal
issues
to
the
test
on
his
mind
hence
poland
destinies
seemed
to
me
the
stage
best
calculated
for
the
development
of
any
task
there
certainly
were
matters
enough
for
the
exhibition
of
all
that
human
nature
could
suffer
and
endure
and
alas
perish
under
in
the
nearly
simultaneous
but
terrible
regicidal
revolution
of
france
but
i
shrunk
from
that
as
a
tale
of
horror
the
work
of
demons
in
the
shapes
of
men
it
was
a
conflict
in
which
no
comparisons
as
between
man
and
man
could
exist
and
may
god
grant
that
so
fearful
a
visitation
may
never
be
inflicted
on
this
world
again
may
the
nations
of
this
world
lay
its
warnings
to
their
hearts
it
sprung
from
a
tree
which
only
could
produce
such
fruits
the
demon
hierarchy
of
the
french
philosophers
who
had
long
denied
the
being
of
that
pure
and
almighty
god
and
who
in
the
arrogance
of
their
own
deified
reason
and
while
in
utter
subjection
to
the
wildest
desires
of
their
passions
published
their
profane
and
polluted
creed
amongst
all
orders
of
the
people
and
the
natural
and
terrible
consequences
ensued
ignorant
before
they
became
like
unto
their
teachers
demons
in
their
unbelief
demons
in
one
common
envy
and
hatred
of
all
degrees
above
them
or
around
them
whose
existence
seemed
at
all
in
the
way
of
even
their
slightest
gratification
mutual
spoliation
and
destruction
covered
the
country
how
often
has
the
tale
been
told
me
by
noble
refugees
sheltered
on
our
shores
from
those
scenes
of
blood
where
infamy
triumphed
and
truth
and
honor
were
massacred
but
such
narratives
though
they
never
can
be
forgotten
are
too
direful
for
the
hearer
to
contemplate
in
memory
therefore
when
i
sought
to
represent
the
mental
and
moral
contest
of
man
with
himself
or
with
his
i
did
not
look
for
their
field
amongst
human
monsters
but
with
natural
and
civilized
man
inasmuch
as
he
is
seen
to
be
influenced
by
the
impulses
of
his
selfish
passions
ambition
covetousness
and
the
vanities
of
life
or
on
the
opposite
side
by
the
generous
amenities
of
true
disinterestedness
in
all
its
trying
situations
and
as
i
have
said
the
recent
struggle
in
poland
to
maintain
her
laws
and
loyal
independence
against
the
combined
aggressions
of
the
three
most
powerful
states
in
europe
seemed
to
afford
me
the
most
suitable
objects
for
my
moral
aim
to
interest
by
sympathy
while
it
taught
the
responsible
commission
of
human
life
i
have
now
described
the
plan
of
my
story
its
aim
and
origin
if
it
be
disapproved
let
it
be
at
once
laid
aside
but
should
it
excite
any
interest
i
pray
its
perusal
may
be
accompanied
with
an
indulgent
candor
its
subjects
being
of
so
new
and
therefore
uncustomary
a
character
in
a
work
of
the
kind
but
if
the
reader
be
one
of
my
own
sex
i
would
especially
solicit
her
patience
while
going
through
the
first
portion
of
the
tale
its
author
being
aware
that
war
and
politics
are
not
the
most
promising
themes
for
an
agreeable
amusement
but
the
battles
are
not
frequent
nor
do
the
cabinet
councils
last
long
i
beg
the
favor
if
the
story
is
to
be
read
at
all
that
no
scene
may
be
passed
over
as
extraneous
for
though
it
begin
like
a
or
a
sermon
it
always
terminates
by
casting
some
new
light
on
the
portrait
of
the
hero
beyond
those
events
of
peril
and
of
patriotic
devotedness
the
remainder
of
the
pages
dwell
generally
with
domestic
interests
but
if
the
reader
do
not
approach
them
regularly
through
the
development
of
character
opened
in
the
preceding
troubled
field
what
they
exhibit
will
seem
a
mere
wilderness
of
incidents
without
interest
or
end
indeed
i
have
designed
nothing
in
the
personages
of
this
narrative
out
of
the
way
of
living
experience
i
have
sketched
no
virtue
that
i
have
not
seen
nor
painted
any
folly
from
imagination
i
have
endeavored
to
be
as
faithful
to
reality
in
my
pictures
of
domestic
morals
and
of
heroic
duties
as
a
just
painter
would
seek
to
be
to
the
existing
objects
of
nature
wonderful
and
wild
or
of
gentlest
beauty
and
on
these
grounds
i
have
steadily
attempted
to
inculcate
that
virtue
is
the
highest
proof
of
understanding
and
the
only
solid
basis
of
greatness
that
vice
is
the
natural
consequence
of
grovelling
thoughts
which
begin
in
mistake
and
end
in
ignominy
postcript
to
a
subsequent
edition
after
so
many
intervening
years
have
passed
since
the
author
of
thaddeus
of
warsaw
wrote
the
foregoing
preface
to
introduce
a
work
so
novel
in
its
character
to
the
notice
and
candid
judgment
of
the
british
public
it
was
her
intention
to
take
the
present
occasion
of
its
now
perfectly
new
republication
at
the
distance
of
above
forty
years
from
its
earliest
appearance
and
so
continued
editions
to
express
her
grateful
sense
of
that
public
gratifying
sympathies
and
honoring
testimonies
of
approbation
from
its
author
youth
to
age
but
even
in
the
hour
she
sits
down
to
perform
the
gracious
task
she
feels
a
present
incapability
to
undertake
it
the
very
attempt
has
too
sensibly
recalled
to
her
heart
events
that
have
befallen
her
since
she
lived
amongst
the
models
of
her
tale
and
she
has
also
more
recently
been
in
many
of
the
places
it
describes
and
circumstances
both
of
joys
and
sorrows
having
occurred
to
her
there
to
influence
the
whole
future
current
of
her
mortal
life
she
finds
it
impossible
to
yet
touch
on
those
times
and
scenes
connected
with
the
subjects
of
her
happy
youth
which
would
now
only
reverberate
notes
of
sadness
it
is
her
duty
to
repress
hence
though
while
revising
the
work
itself
she
experiences
a
calm
delight
in
the
occupation
being
a
kind
of
parting
duty
also
to
the
descendants
of
her
earliest
readers
she
would
rather
defer
any
little
elucidations
she
may
have
met
with
regarding
the
objects
of
her
pen
to
a
few
pages
in
the
form
of
an
appendix
at
the
end
of
the
work
all
indeed
bringing
her
observations
whether
by
weal
or
woe
to
the
one
great
and
guiding
conclusion
man
is
formed
for
two
states
of
existence

mortal
and
an
immortal

for

the
large
and
magnificent
palace
of
villanow
whose
vast
domains
stretch
along
the
northern
bank
of
the
vistula
was
the
favorite
residence
of
john
sobieski
king
of
poland
that
monarch
after
having
delivered
his
country
from
innumerable
enemies
rescued
vienna
and
subdued
the
turks
retired
to
this
place
at
certain
seasons
and
thence
dispensed
those
acts
of
his
luminous
and
benevolent
mind
which
rendered
his
name
great
and
his
people
happy
when
charles
the
twelfth
of
sweden
visited
the
tomb
of
sobieski
at
cracow
he
exclaimed
what
a
pity
that
so
great
a
man
should
ever
die
footnote
in
the
year
this
hero
raised
the
siege
of
vienna
then
beleagured
by
the
turks
and
driving
them
out
of
europe
saved
christendom
from
a
mohammedan
usurpation
another
generation
saw
the
spirit
of
this
lamented
hero
revive
in
the
person
of
his
descendant
constantine
count
sobieski
who
in
a
comparatively
private
station
as
palatine
of
masovia
and
the
friend
rather
than
the
lord
of
his
vassals
evinced
by
his
actions
that
he
was
the
inheritor
of
his
forefather
virtue
as
well
as
of
his
blood
he
was
the
first
polish
nobleman
who
granted
freedom
to
his
peasants
he
threw
down
their
mud
hovels
and
built
comfortable
villages
he
furnished
them
with
seed
cattle
and
implements
of
husbandry
and
calling
their
families
together
laid
before
them
the
deed
of
their
enfranchisement
but
before
he
signed
it
he
expressed
a
fear
that
they
would
abuse
this
liberty
of
which
they
had
not
had
experience
and
become
licentious
no
returned
a
venerable
peasant
when
we
were
ignorant
men
and
possessed
no
property
of
our
own
except
these
staffs
in
our
hands
we
were
destitute
of
all
manly
motives
for
propriety
of
conduct
but
you
have
taught
us
to
read
out
of
the
holy
book
how
to
serve
god
and
honor
the
king
and
shall
we
not
respect
laws
which
thus
bestow
on
us
and
ensure
to
us
the
fruits
of
our
labors
and
the
favor
of
heaven
the
good
sense
and
truth
of
this
answer
were
manifested
in
the
event
on
the
emancipation
of
these
people
they
became
so
prosperous
in
business
and
correct
in
behavior
that
the
example
of
the
palatine
was
speedily
followed
by
the
chancellor
zamoiski
footnote
this
family
had
ever
been
one
of
the
noblest
and
most
virtuous
in
poland
and
had
its
wisdom
been
listened
to
in
former
years
by
certain
powerful
and
wildly
ambitious
lords
that
once
great
kingdom
would
never
have
exchanged
its
long
line
of
hereditary
for
an
elective
monarchy
that
arena
of
all
political
mischiefs
and
several
of
the
principal
nobility
the
royal
stanislaus
beneficent
spirit
moved
in
unison
with
that
of
sobieski
and
a
constitution
was
given
to
poland
to
place
her
in
the
first
rank
of
free
nations
encircled
by
his
happy
tenantry
and
within
the
bosom
of
his
family
this
illustrious
man
educated
thaddeus
the
only
male
heir
of
his
name
to
the
exercise
of
all
the
virtues
which
ennoble
and
endear
the
possessor
but
this
reign
of
public
and
domestic
peace
was
not
to
continue
three
formidable
and
apparently
friendly
states
envied
the
effects
of
a
patriotism
they
would
not
imitate
and
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
regardless
of
existing
treaties
broke
in
upon
the
unguarded
frontiers
of
poland
threatening
with
all
the
horrors
of
a
merciless
war
the
properties
lives
and
liberties
of
the
people
the
family
of
sobieski
had
ever
been
foremost
in
the
ranks
of
their
country
and
at
the
present
crisis
its
venerable
head
did
not
hang
behind
the
youngest
warrior
in
preparations
for
the
field
on
the
evening
of
an
anniversary
of
the
birthday
of
his
grandson
the
palatine
rode
abroad
with
a
party
of
friends
who
had
been
celebrating
the
festival
with
their
presence
the
countess
his
daughter
and
thaddeus
were
left
alone
in
the
saloon
she
sighed
as
she
gazed
on
her
son
who
stood
at
some
distance
fitting
to
his
youthful
thigh
a
variety
of
sabres
which
his
servant
a
little
time
before
had
laid
upon
the
table
she
observed
with
anxiety
the
eagerness
of
his
motion
and
the
ardor
that
was
flashing
from
his
eyes
thaddeus
said
she
lay
down
that
sword
i
wish
to
speak
with
you
thaddeus
looked
gayly
up
my
dear
thaddeus
cried
his
mother
and
tears
started
to
her
eyes
the
blush
of
enthusiasm
faded
from
his
face
he
threw
the
sabre
from
him
and
drew
near
the
countess
why
my
dear
mother
do
you
distress
yourself
when
i
am
in
battle
shall
i
not
have
my
grandfather
near
me
and
be
as
much
under
the
protection
of
god
as
at
this
moment
yes
my
child
answered
she
god
will
protect
you
he
is
the
protector
of
the
orphan
and
you
are
fatherless
the
countess
paused
here
my
son
said
she
giving
him
a
sealed
packet
take
this
it
will
reveal
to
you
the
history
of
your
birth
and
the
name
of
your
father
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
know
a
painful
fact
which
has
hitherto
been
concealed
from
you
by
the
wish
and
noble
judgment
of
your
grandfather
thaddeus
received
it
and
stood
silent
with
surprise
read
it
my
love
continued
she
but
go
to
your
own
apartments
here
you
may
be
interrupted
bewildered
by
the
manner
of
the
countess
thaddeus
without
answering
instantly
obeyed
shutting
himself
within
his
study
he
impatiently
opened
the
papers
and
soon
found
his
whole
attention
absorbed
in
the
following
recital
to
my
dear
son
thaddeus
constantine
sobieski
you
are
now
my
thaddeus
at
the
early
age
of
nineteen
going
to
engage
the
enemies
of
your
country
ere
i
resign
my
greatest
comfort
to
the
casualties
of
war
ere
i
part
with
you
perhaps
forever
i
would
inform
you
who
your
father
really
was
that
father
whose
existence
you
have
hardly
known
and
whose
name
you
have
never
heard
you
believe
yourself
an
orphan
your
mother
a
widow
but
alas
i
have
now
to
tell
you
that
you
were
made
fatherless
by
the
perfidy
of
man
not
by
the
dispensation
of
heaven
years
ago
i
accompanied
my
father
in
a
tour
through
germany
and
italy
grief
for
the
death
of
my
mother
had
impaired
his
health
and
the
physicians
ordered
him
to
reside
in
a
warmer
climate
accordingly
we
fixed
ourselves
near
the
arno
during
several
visits
to
florence
my
father
met
in
that
city
with
a
young
englishman
of
the
name
of
sackville
these
frequent
meetings
opened
into
intimacy
and
he
was
invited
to
our
villa
sackville
was
not
only
the
most
interesting
man
i
had
ever
seen
but
the
most
accomplished
and
his
heart
seemed
the
seat
of
every
graceful
feeling
he
was
the
first
man
for
whose
society
i
felt
a
lively
preference
i
used
to
smile
at
this
strange
delight
or
sometimes
weep
for
the
emotions
which
agitated
me
were
undefinable
but
they
were
enchanting
and
unheedingly
i
gave
them
indulgence
the
hours
which
we
passed
together
in
the
interchange
of
reciprocal
sentiments
the
kind
beaming
of
his
looks
the
thousand
sighs
that
he
breathed
the
sentences
all
conspired
to
rob
me
of
myself
nearly
twelve
months
were
spent
in
these
delusions
during
the
last
three
doubts
and
anguish
displaced
the
blissful
reveries
of
an
infant
tenderness
the
attentions
of
sackville
died
away
from
being
the
object
of
his
constant
search
he
then
sedulously
sought
to
avoid
me
when
my
father
withdrew
to
his
closet
he
would
take
his
leave
and
allow
me
to
walk
alone
solitary
and
wretched
were
my
rambles
i
had
full
leisure
to
compare
my
then
disturbed
state
of
mind
with
the
comparative
peace
i
had
enjoyed
in
my
own
country
immured
within
the
palace
of
villanow
watching
the
declining
health
of
my
mother
i
knew
nothing
of
the
real
world
the
little
i
had
learned
of
society
being
drawn
from
books
and
uncorrected
by
experience
i
was
taught
to
believe
a
perfection
in
man
which
to
my
affliction
i
since
found
to
be
but
a
poet
dream
when
my
father
took
me
to
italy
i
continued
averse
to
public
company
in
such
seclusion
the
presence
of
sackville
being
almost
my
only
pleasure
chased
from
my
mind
its
usual
reserve
and
gradually
and
surely
won
upon
the
awakened
affections
of
my
heart
artless
and
unwarned
i
knew
not
the
nature
of
the
passion
which
i
cherished
until
it
had
gained
an
ascendancy
that
menaced
my
life
on
the
evening
of
one
of
those
days
in
which
i
had
been
disappointed
of
seeing
this
companion
i
strolled
out
and
hardly
conscious
of
my
actions
threw
myself
along
the
summit
of
a
flight
of
steps
in
our
garden
that
led
down
to
the
arno
my
head
rested
against
the
base
of
a
statue
which
because
of
its
resemblance
to
me
sackville
had
presented
to
my
father
every
recollected
kindness
of
his
now
gave
me
additional
torment
and
clinging
to
the
pedestal
as
to
the
altar
of
my
adoration
in
the
bitterness
of
disappointment
i
addressed
the
insensible
stone
were
i
pale
as
thou
art
and
this
breast
as
cold
and
still
would
sackville
when
he
looked
on
me
give
one
sigh
to
the
creature
he
had
destroyed
my
sobs
followed
this
adjuration
and
the
next
moment
i
felt
myself
encircled
in
his
arms
i
struggled
and
almost
fainting
with
shame
at
such
utter
weakness
implored
to
be
released
he
did
release
me
and
in
an
agony
of
emotion
besought
my
pardon
for
the
misery
i
had
endured
therese
cried
he
is
as
it
ought
to
be
you
are
my
only
hope
consent
to
be
mine
or
the
world
has
no
hold
on
me
his
voice
was
hurried
and
incoherent
raising
my
eyes
to
his
i
beheld
them
wild
and
bloodshot
terrified
at
his
look
and
overcome
by
my
own
distracted
thoughts
my
head
sunk
on
the
marble
with
increased
violence
he
exclaimed
i
deceived
myself
here
too
therese
did
you
not
prefer
me
did
you
not
love
me
speak
now
i
conjure
you
by
your
own
happiness
and
mine
do
you
reject
me
he
clasped
my
hands
with
a
force
that
made
me
tremble
and
i
hardly
articulated
will
be
yours
at
these
words
he
hurried
me
down
a
dark
vista
which
led
out
of
the
gardens
to
the
open
country
a
carriage
stood
at
the
gate
i
fearfully
asked
what
he
intended
have
given
yourself
to
me
cried
he
by
that
vow
written
in
heaven
no
power
shall
separate
us
until
you
are
mine
beyond
the
reach
of
man
unnerved
in
body
and
weak
in
mind
i
yielded
to
his
impetuosity
and
suffering
him
to
lift
me
into
the
chariot
was
carried
to
the
door
of
the
nearest
monastery
where
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
married
i
am
thus
particular
in
the
relation
of
every
incident
in
the
hope
that
you
my
dear
son
will
find
some
excuse
for
my
great
imprudence
in
the
circumstances
of
my
youth
and
in
the
influence
which
a
man
who
seemed
all
excellence
had
gained
over
my
heart
however
my
fault
went
not
long
unpunished
the
ceremony
past
my
husband
conducted
me
in
silence
back
to
the
carriage
my
full
bosom
discharged
itself
in
abundance
of
tears
while
sackville
sat
by
me
without
any
movement
and
mute
two
or
three
times
i
raised
my
eyes
in
hopes
of
discerning
in
his
some
consolation
for
my
hasty
compliance
but
no
his
gaze
vacant
and
glaring
was
fixed
on
the
window
and
his
brow
became
heavily
clouded
as
if
he
had
been
forced
into
an
alliance
with
one
he
hated
rather
than
had
just
made
a
voluntary
engagement
with
the
woman
he
loved
my
soul
shuddered
at
this
commencement
of
a
contract
which
i
had
dared
to
make
unsanctioned
by
my
father
consent
at
length
my
sighs
seemed
to
startle
my
husband
and
suddenly
turning
round
he
cried
this
marriage
must
not
be
told
to
the
palatine
i
have
been
precipitate
it
would
ruin
me
with
my
family
refrain
only
for
one
month
and
then
i
will
publicly
acknowledge
you
the
agitation
of
his
features
and
the
feverish
burning
of
his
hand
which
then
held
mine
alarmed
me
trembling
from
head
to
foot
i
answered
i
have
already
erred
enough
in
consenting
to
this
stolen
marriage
i
will
not
transgress
further
by
concealing
it
i
will
instantly
throw
myself
at
my
father
feet
and
confess
all
his
countenance
darkened
again
said
he
am
your
husband
you
have
sworn
to
obey
me
and
till
i
allow
you
divulge
this
marriage
at
your
peril
this
last
stern
sentence
and
the
sterner
look
that
accompanied
it
pierced
me
to
the
heart
and
i
fell
senseless
on
the
seat
when
i
recovered
i
found
myself
at
the
foot
of
that
statue
beneath
which
my
unfortunate
destiny
had
been
fixed
my
husband
was
leaning
over
me
he
raised
me
with
tenderness
from
the
ground
and
conjured
me
in
the
mildest
accents
to
be
comforted
to
pardon
the
severity
of
those
words
which
had
arisen
from
a
fear
that
by
an
imprudent
avowal
on
my
part
i
should
risk
both
his
happiness
and
my
own
he
informed
me
that
he
was
heir
to
one
of
the
first
families
in
england
and
before
he
set
out
for
the
continent
he
had
pledged
his
honor
to
his
father
never
to
enter
into
any
matrimonial
engagement
without
first
acquainting
him
with
the
particulars
of
the
lady
and
her
family
should
he
omit
this
duty
his
father
declared
that
though
she
were
a
princess
he
would
disinherit
him
and
never
again
admit
him
to
his
presence
this
my
dear
therese
continued
he
you
endure
to
behold
me
an
outcast
and
stigmatized
with
a
parent
curse
when
a
little
forbearance
on
your
part
would
make
all
right
i
know
i
have
been
hasty
in
acting
as
i
have
done
but
now
i
can
not
remedy
my
error
i
will
write
to
my
father
describe
your
rank
and
merits
and
request
his
consent
to
our
immediate
union
the
moment
his
permission
arrives
i
will
cast
myself
on
the
friendship
and
reveal
what
has
passed
the
tenderness
of
my
husband
blinded
my
reason
and
with
many
tears
i
sealed
his
forgiveness
and
pledged
my
faith
on
his
word
my
dear
deceived
parent
little
suspected
the
perfidy
of
his
guest
he
detained
him
as
his
visitor
and
often
rallied
himself
on
the
hold
which
this
distinguished
stranger
accomplishments
had
taken
on
his
heart
sackville
manner
to
me
in
public
was
obliging
and
free
it
was
in
private
only
that
i
found
the
tender
the
capricious
the
unkind
husband
night
after
night
i
have
washed
the
memory
of
my
want
of
duty
to
my
father
with
bitter
tears
but
my
husband
was
dear
to
me
he
was
more
precious
than
my
life
one
affectionate
look
from
him
one
fond
word
would
solace
every
pain
and
make
me
wait
the
arrival
of
his
father
letter
with
all
the
sanguine
anticipations
of
youth
and
love
a
fortnight
passed
away
a
month
a
long
and
lingering
month
another
month
and
a
packet
of
letters
was
presented
to
sackville
he
was
conversing
with
us
at
sight
of
the
superscription
he
tore
open
the
paper
ran
his
eyes
over
a
few
lines
and
then
flushed
and
agitated
started
from
his
seat
and
left
the
room
my
emotions
were
almost
uncontrollable
i
had
already
half
risen
from
my
chair
to
follow
him
when
the
palatine
exclaimed
can
be
in
that
letter
too
plainly
i
see
some
afflicting
tidings
and
without
observing
me
or
waiting
for
a
reply
he
hurried
out
after
him
i
hastened
to
my
chamber
where
throwing
myself
on
my
bed
i
tried
by
all
the
delusions
of
hope
to
obtain
some
alleviation
from
the
pangs
of
my
suspense
the
roused
me
from
my
reverie
dreading
to
excite
suspicion
and
anxious
to
read
in
the
countenance
of
my
husband
the
denunciation
of
our
fate
i
obeyed
the
summons
and
descended
to
the
on
entering
it
my
eyes
irresistibly
wandered
round
to
fix
themselves
on
sackville
he
was
leaning
against
a
pillar
his
face
pale
as
death
my
father
looked
grave
but
immediately
took
his
seat
and
tenderly
placed
his
friend
beside
him
i
sat
down
in
silence
little
dinner
was
eaten
and
few
words
spoken
as
for
myself
my
agitation
almost
choked
me
i
felt
that
the
first
words
i
should
attempt
to
pronounce
must
give
them
utterance
and
that
their
vehemence
would
betray
our
fatal
secret
when
the
servants
had
withdrawn
sackville
rose
and
said
in
a
faltering
voice
i
must
leave
you
replied
the
palatine
are
unwell
disturbed
stay
till
thank
your
excellency
answered
he
i
must
go
to
florence
you
shall
see
me
again
before
afternoon
all
will
then
i
hope
be
settled
to
my
wish
my
husband
took
his
hat
motionless
and
incapable
of
speaking
i
sat
fixed
to
my
chair
in
the
direct
way
that
he
must
pass
his
eye
met
mine
he
stopped
and
looked
at
me
abruptly
snatched
my
hand
then
as
abruptly
quitting
it
darted
out
of
the
room
i
never
saw
him
more
i
had
not
the
power
to
dissemble
another
moment
i
fell
back
into
the
arms
of
my
father
he
did
not
even
by
this
imprudence
read
what
i
almost
wished
him
to
guess
but
with
all
the
indulgence
of
perfect
confidence
lamented
the
distress
of
sackville
and
the
sensibility
of
my
nature
which
sympathized
so
painfully
with
his
friend
i
durst
not
ask
what
was
the
distress
of
his
friend
abashed
at
my
duplicity
to
my
father
and
overwhelmed
with
a
thousand
dreads
i
obtained
his
permission
to
retire
to
my
chamber
the
next
day
i
met
him
with
calmness
for
i
had
schooled
my
heart
to
endure
the
sufferings
it
had
deserved
he
did
not
remark
my
recovered
tranquillity
so
entirely
was
his
generous
heart
occupied
in
conjecturing
the
cause
of
sackville
grief
who
had
acknowledged
having
received
a
great
shock
but
would
not
reveal
the
occasion
this
double
reserve
to
my
father
surprised
and
distressed
me
and
to
all
his
suppositions
i
said
little
my
soul
was
too
deeply
interested
in
the
subject
to
trust
to
the
faithfulness
of
my
lips
the
morning
crept
slowly
on
and
the
noon
appeared
to
stand
still
i
anxiously
watched
the
declining
sun
as
the
signal
for
my
return
two
hours
had
elapsed
since
his
promised
time
and
my
father
grew
so
impatient
that
he
went
out
to
meet
him
i
eagerly
wished
that
they
might
miss
each
other
i
should
then
see
sackville
a
few
minutes
alone
and
by
one
word
be
comforted
or
driven
to
despair
i
was
listening
to
every
footstep
that
sounded
under
the
colonnade
when
my
servant
brought
me
a
letter
which
had
just
been
left
by
one
of
sackville
grooms
i
broke
open
the
seal
and
fell
senseless
on
the
floor
ere
i
had
read
half
the
killing
contents
thaddeus
with
a
burning
cheek
and
a
heart
all
at
once
robbed
of
that
elastic
spring
which
till
now
had
ever
made
him
the
happiest
of
the
happy
took
up
the
letter
of
his
father
the
paper
was
worn
and
blistered
with
his
mother
tears
his
head
seemed
to
swim
as
he
contemplated
the
handwriting
and
he
said
to
himself
am
i
to
respect
or
to
abhor
him
he
proceeded
in
the
perusal
to
therese
countess
sobieski
how
therese
am
i
to
address
you
but
an
attempt
to
palliate
my
conduct
would
be
to
no
purpose
indeed
it
is
impossible
you
can
not
conceive
a
viler
opinion
of
me
than
i
have
of
myself
i
know
that
i
forfeit
all
claim
to
honor
in
the
most
delicate
point
of
your
noble
and
trusting
heart
that
i
have
sacrificed
your
tenderness
to
my
distracted
passions
but
you
shall
no
more
be
subject
to
the
caprices
of
a
man
who
can
not
repay
your
innocent
love
with
his
own
have
no
guilt
to
torture
you
and
you
possess
virtues
which
will
render
you
tranquil
under
every
calamity
i
leave
you
to
your
own
purity
and
therefore
peace
of
mind
forget
the
ceremony
which
has
passed
between
us
my
wretched
heart
disclaims
it
forever
your
father
is
happily
ignorant
of
it
pray
spare
him
the
anguish
of
knowing
that
i
was
so
utterly
unworthy
of
his
kindness
i
feel
that
i
am
more
than
ungrateful
to
you
and
to
him
therese
your
most
inveterate
hate
can
not
more
strongly
tell
me
than
i
can
tell
myself
that
to
you
i
have
been
a
villain
but
i
can
not
retract
i
am
going
where
all
search
will
be
vain
and
i
now
bid
you
an
eternal
farewell
may
you
be
happier
than
ever
can
be
the
r

florence
thaddeus
after
a
brief
pause
went
on
with
his
mother
narrative
when
my
senses
returned
i
was
lying
on
the
floor
holding
the
perused
paper
in
my
hand
grief
and
horror
had
locked
up
the
avenues
of
complaint
and
i
sat
as
one
petrified
to
stone
my
father
entered
at
the
sight
of
me
he
started
as
if
he
had
been
a
spectre
his
known
features
opened
at
once
my
agonized
heart
with
fearful
cries
i
cast
myself
at
his
feet
and
putting
the
letter
into
his
hand
clung
almost
expiring
to
his
knees
when
he
had
read
it
he
flung
it
from
him
and
dropping
into
a
chair
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
i
looked
up
imploringly
for
i
could
not
speak
my
father
stooped
forward
and
raising
me
in
his
arms
pressed
me
to
his
bosom
therese
said
he
is
i
who
have
done
this
had
i
not
harbored
this
villain
he
never
could
have
had
an
opportunity
of
ruining
the
peace
of
my
child
in
return
for
the
unexampled
indulgence
of
this
speech
and
his
repeated
assurances
of
forgiveness
i
promised
to
forget
a
man
who
could
have
had
so
little
respect
for
truth
and
gratitude
and
his
own
honor
the
palatine
replied
that
he
expected
such
a
resolution
in
consequence
of
the
principles
my
exemplary
mother
had
taught
me
and
to
show
me
how
far
dearer
to
him
was
my
real
tranquillity
than
any
false
idea
of
impossible
restitution
he
would
not
remove
even
from
one
principality
to
another
were
he
sure
by
that
means
to
discover
sackville
and
to
avenge
my
wrongs
my
understanding
assented
to
the
justice
and
dignity
of
all
he
said
but
long
and
severe
were
my
struggles
before
i
could
erase
from
my
soul
the
image
of
that
being
who
had
been
the
lord
of
all
my
young
hopes
it
was
not
until
you
my
dear
thaddeus
were
born
that
i
could
repay
the
goodness
of
my
father
with
the
smiles
of
cheerfulness
and
he
would
not
permit
me
to
give
you
any
name
which
could
remind
him
or
myself
of
the
faithless
husband
who
knew
not
even
of
your
existence
and
by
his
desire
i
christened
you
thaddeus
constantine
after
himself
and
his
best
beloved
friend
general
kosciusko
you
have
not
yet
seen
that
illustrious
polander
his
prescient
watchfulness
for
his
country
keeps
him
so
constantly
employed
on
the
frontiers
he
is
now
with
the
army
at
winnica
whither
you
must
soon
go
and
in
him
you
may
study
one
of
the
brightest
models
of
patriotic
and
martial
virtue
that
ever
was
presented
to
mankind
it
is
well
said
of
him
he
would
have
shone
with
distinguished
lustre
in
the
ages
of
chivalry
gallant
generous
and
strictly
just
he
commands
obedience
by
the
reverence
in
which
he
is
held
and
attaches
the
troops
to
his
person
by
the
affability
of
his
manners
and
the
purity
of
his
life
he
teaches
them
discipline
endurance
of
fatigue
and
contempt
of
danger
by
his
dauntless
example
and
inspires
them
with
confidence
by
his
tranquillity
in
the
tumult
of
action
and
the
invincible
fortitude
with
which
he
meets
the
most
adverse
stroke
of
misfortune
his
modesty
in
victory
shows
him
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
among
men
and
his
magnanimity
under
defeat
confirms
him
to
be
a
christian
hero
such
is
the
man
whose
name
you
share
how
bitterly
do
i
lament
that
the
one
to
which
nature
gave
you
a
claim
was
so
unworthy
to
be
united
with
it
and
that
of
my
no
less
heroic
father
on
our
return
to
poland
the
story
which
the
palatine
related
when
questioned
about
my
apparently
forlorn
state
was
simply
this
daughter
was
married
and
widowed
in
the
course
of
two
months
since
then
to
root
from
her
memory
as
much
as
possible
all
recollection
of
a
husband
who
was
only
given
to
be
taken
away
she
still
retains
my
name
and
her
son
as
my
sole
heir
shall
bear
no
other
this
reply
satisfied
every
one
the
king
who
was
my
father
only
confidant
gave
his
sanction
to
it
and
no
further
inquiries
were
ever
made
you
are
now
my
beloved
child
entering
on
the
eventful
career
of
life
god
only
knows
when
the
venerable
head
of
your
grandfather
is
laid
in
dust
and
i
too
have
shut
my
eyes
upon
you
in
this
world
where
destiny
may
send
you
perhaps
to
the
country
of
your
father
should
you
ever
meet
him
but
that
is
unlikely
so
i
will
be
silent
on
a
thought
which
nineteen
years
of
reflection
have
not
yet
deprived
of
its
sting
not
to
embitter
the
fresh
spring
of
your
youth
my
thaddeus
with
the
draught
that
has
poisoned
mine
not
to
implant
in
your
breast
hatred
of
a
parent
whom
you
may
never
behold
have
i
written
this
but
to
inform
you
in
fact
from
whom
you
sprung
my
history
is
made
plain
to
you
that
no
unexpected
events
may
hereafter
perplex
your
opinion
of
your
mother
or
cause
a
blush
to
rise
on
that
cheek
for
her
which
from
your
grandfather
can
derive
no
stain
for
his
sake
as
well
as
for
mine
whether
in
peace
or
in
war
may
the
angels
of
heaven
guard
my
boy
this
is
the
unceasing
prayer
of
thy
fond
mother
therese
countess
sobieski
villanow
when
he
finished
reading
thaddeus
held
the
papers
in
his
hand
but
unable
to
recover
from
the
shock
of
their
contents
he
read
them
a
second
time
to
the
end
then
laying
them
on
the
table
against
which
he
rested
his
now
aching
head
he
gave
vent
to
the
fulness
of
his
heart
in
tears
the
countess
anxious
for
the
effect
which
her
history
might
have
made
on
her
son
at
this
instant
entered
the
room
seeing
him
in
so
dejected
an
attitude
she
approached
and
pressing
him
to
her
bosom
silently
wept
with
him
thaddeus
ashamed
of
his
emotions
yet
incapable
of
dissembling
them
struggled
a
moment
to
release
himself
from
her
arms
the
countess
mistaking
his
motive
said
in
a
melancholy
voice
and
do
you
my
son
despise
your
mother
for
the
weakness
which
she
has
revealed
is
this
the
reception
that
i
expected
from
a
child
on
whose
affection
i
reposed
my
confidence
and
my
comfort
no
my
mother
replied
thaddeus
it
is
your
afflictions
which
have
distressed
me
this
is
the
first
unhappy
hour
i
ever
knew
and
can
you
wonder
i
should
be
affected
oh
mother
continued
he
laying
his
hand
on
his
father
letter
whatever
were
his
rank
had
my
father
been
but
noble
in
mind
i
would
have
gloried
in
bearing
his
name
but
now
i
put
up
my
prayers
never
to
hear
it
more
forget
him
cried
the
countess
hiding
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
i
will
answered
thaddeus
and
allow
my
memory
to
dwell
on
the
virtues
of
my
mother
only
it
was
impossible
for
the
countess
or
her
son
to
conceal
their
agitation
from
the
palatine
who
now
opened
the
door
on
his
expressing
alarm
at
a
sight
so
unusual
his
daughter
finding
herself
incapable
of
speaking
put
into
his
hand
the
letter
which
thaddeus
had
just
read
sobieski
cast
his
eye
over
the
first
lines
he
comprehended
their
tendency
and
seeing
the
countess
had
withdrawn
he
looked
towards
his
grandson
thaddeus
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
striving
to
command
himself
for
the
conversation
he
anticipated
with
his
grandfather
i
am
sorry
thaddeus
said
sobieski
that
your
mother
has
so
abruptly
imparted
to
you
the
real
country
and
character
of
your
father
i
see
that
his
villany
has
distressed
a
heart
which
heaven
has
made
alive
to
even
the
slightest
appearance
of
dishonor
but
be
consoled
my
son
i
have
prevented
the
publicity
of
his
conduct
by
an
ambiguous
story
of
your
mother
widowhood
yet
notwithstanding
this
arrangement
she
has
judged
it
proper
that
you
should
not
enter
general
society
without
being
made
acquainted
with
the
true
events
of
your
birth
i
believe
my
daughter
is
right
and
cheer
yourself
my
child
ever
remembering
that
you
are
one
of
the
noblest
race
in
poland
and
suffer
not
the
vices
of
one
parent
to
dim
the
virtues
of
the
other
no
my
lord
answered
his
grandson
you
have
been
more
than
a
parent
to
me
and
henceforward
for
your
sake
as
well
as
my
own
i
shall
hold
it
my
duty
to
forget
that
i
draw
my
being
from
any
other
source
than
that
of
the
house
of
sobieski
you
are
right
cried
the
palatine
with
an
exulting
emotion
you
have
the
spirit
of
your
ancestors
and
i
shall
live
to
see
you
add
glory
to
the
name

the

of

the
fearful
day
arrived
when
sobieski
and
his
grandson
were
to
bid
adieu
to
villanow
and
its
peaceful
scenes
the
mind
of
the
veteran
bade
his
daughter
farewell
with
a
fortitude
which
imparted
some
of
its
strength
even
to
her
but
when
thaddeus
ready
habited
for
his
journey
entered
the
room
at
the
sight
of
his
military
accoutrements
she
shuddered
and
when
with
a
glowing
countenance
he
advanced
smiling
through
his
tears
towards
her
she
clasped
him
in
her
arms
and
riveted
her
lips
to
that
face
the
very
loveliness
of
which
added
to
her
affliction
she
gazed
at
him
she
wept
on
his
neck
she
pressed
him
to
her
bosom
oh
how
soon
might
all
that
beauty
be
mingled
with
the
dust
how
soon
might
that
warm
heart
which
then
beat
against
hers
be
pierced
by
the
sword
be
laid
on
the
ground
mangled
and
bleeding
exposed
and
trampled
on
these
thoughts
thronged
upon
her
soul
and
deprived
her
of
sense
she
was
borne
away
by
her
maids
while
the
palatine
compelled
thaddeus
to
quit
the
spot
it
was
not
until
the
lofty
battlements
of
villanow
blended
with
the
clouds
that
thaddeus
could
throw
off
his
melancholy
the
parting
grief
of
his
mother
hung
on
his
spirits
and
heavy
and
frequent
were
his
sighs
while
he
gazed
on
the
rustic
cottages
and
fertile
fields
which
reminded
him
that
he
was
yet
passing
through
the
territories
of
his
grandfather
the
picturesque
mill
of
mariemont
was
the
last
spot
on
which
his
sight
lingered
the
ivy
that
mantled
its
sides
sparkled
with
the
brightness
of
a
shower
which
had
just
fallen
and
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
gleaming
on
its
shattered
wall
made
it
an
object
of
such
romantic
beauty
that
he
could
not
help
pointing
it
out
to
his
whilst
the
eyes
of
general
butzou
who
was
in
the
carriage
followed
the
direction
of
thaddeus
the
palatine
observed
the
heightening
animation
of
the
old
man
features
and
recollecting
at
the
same
time
the
transports
which
he
himself
had
enjoyed
when
he
visited
that
place
more
than
twenty
years
before
he
put
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
veteran
and
exclaimed
general
did
you
ever
relate
to
my
boy
the
particulars
of
that
mill
no
my
lord
i
suppose
continued
the
palatine
the
same
reason
deterred
you
from
speaking
of
it
uncalled
for
as
lessened
my
wish
to
tell
the
story
we
are
both
too
much
the
heroes
of
the
tale
to
have
volunteered
the
recital
does
your
excellency
mean
asked
thaddeus
the
rescue
of
our
king
from
this
place
i
do
i
have
an
indistinct
knowledge
of
the
affair
continued
his
grandson
from
i
forget
who
and
should
be
grateful
to
hear
it
clearly
told
me
while
thus
looking
on
the
very
spot
but
said
the
palatine
gayly
whose
object
was
to
draw
his
grandson
from
melancholy
reflections
what
will
you
say
to
me
turning
egotist
i
now
ask
the
story
of
you
returned
thaddeus
smiling
besides
as
soldiers
are
permitted
by
their
peaceful
hearth
to
their
battles
again
your
modesty
my
dear
grandfather
can
not
object
to
repeat
one
to
me
on
the
way
to
more
then
as
a
preliminary
said
the
palatine
i
must
suppose
it
is
unnecessary
to
tell
you
that
general
butzou
was
the
brave
soldier
who
at
the
imminent
risk
of
his
own
life
saved
our
sovereign
yes
i
know
that
replied
the
young
count
and
that
you
too
had
a
share
in
the
honor
for
when
i
was
yesterday
presented
to
his
majesty
amongst
other
things
which
he
said
he
told
me
that
under
heaven
he
believed
he
owed
his
present
existence
to
general
butzou
and
yourself
so
very
little
to
me
resumed
the
palatine
that
i
will
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
repeat
every
circumstance
of
the
affair
should
i
err
i
must
beg
of
you
general
turning
to
the
veteran
to
put
me
right
butzou
with
a
glow
of
honest
exultation
nodded
assent
and
thaddeus
bowing
in
sign
of
attention
his
smiling
grandsire
began
it
was
on
a
sunday
night
the
of
september
in
the
year
that
this
event
took
place
at
that
time
instigated
by
the
courts
of
vienna
and
constantinople
a
band
of
traitorous
lords
confederated
together
were
covertly
laying
waste
the
country
and
perpetrating
all
kinds
of
unsuspected
outrage
on
their
who
adhered
to
the
king
amongst
their
numerous
crimes
a
plan
was
laid
for
surprising
and
taking
the
royal
person
casimir
pulaski
was
the
most
daring
of
their
leaders
and
assisted
by
lukawski
strawenski
and
kosinski
three
poles
unworthy
of
their
names
he
resolved
to
accomplish
his
design
or
perish
accordingly
these
men
with
forty
other
conspirators
in
the
presence
of
their
commander
swore
with
the
most
horrid
oaths
to
deliver
stanislaus
alive
or
dead
into
his
hands
about
a
month
after
this
meeting
these
three
parricides
of
their
country
at
the
head
of
their
coadjutors
disguised
as
peasants
and
concealing
their
arms
in
wagons
of
hay
which
they
drove
before
them
entered
the
suburbs
of
warsaw
undetected
it
was
about
ten
on
the
of
september
as
i
have
told
you
they
found
an
apt
opportunity
to
execute
their
scheme
they
placed
themselves
under
cover
of
the
night
in
those
avenues
of
the
city
through
which
they
knew
his
majesty
must
pass
in
his
way
from
villanow
where
he
had
been
dining
with
me
his
carriage
was
escorted
by
four
of
his
own
guards
besides
myself
and
some
of
mine
we
had
scarcely
lost
sight
of
villanow
when
the
conspirators
rushed
out
and
surrounded
us
commanding
the
coachman
to
stop
and
beating
down
the
serving
men
with
the
butt
ends
of
their
muskets
several
shots
were
fired
into
the
coach
one
passed
through
my
hat
as
i
was
getting
out
sword
in
hand
the
better
to
repel
an
attack
the
motive
of
which
i
could
not
then
divine
a
cut
across
my
right
leg
with
a
sabre
laid
me
under
the
wheels
and
whilst
in
that
situation
i
heard
the
shot
pouring
into
the
coach
like
hail
and
felt
the
villains
stepping
over
my
body
to
finish
the
murder
of
their
sovereign
it
was
then
that
our
friend
butzou
who
at
that
period
was
a
private
soldier
in
my
service
stood
between
his
majesty
and
the
rebels
parrying
many
a
stroke
aimed
at
the
king
but
at
last
a
thrust
from
a
bayonet
into
his
gallant
defender
breast
cast
him
weltering
in
his
blood
upon
me
by
this
time
all
the
persons
who
had
formed
the
escort
were
either
wounded
or
dispersed
and
george
butzou
our
friend
only
brother
was
slain
so
dropped
one
by
one
the
protectors
of
our
trampled
bodies
and
of
our
outraged
monarch
secure
then
of
their
prey
one
of
the
assassins
opened
the
carriage
door
and
with
shocking
imprecations
seizing
the
king
discharged
his
pistol
so
near
his
majesty
face
that
he
felt
the
heat
of
the
flash
a
second
villain
cut
him
on
the
forehead
with
a
sabre
whilst
the
third
who
was
on
horseback
laying
hold
of
the
king
collar
dragged
him
along
the
ground
through
the
suburbs
of
the
city
during
the
latter
part
of
this
murderous
scene
some
of
our
affrighted
people
who
had
fled
returned
with
a
detachment
and
seeing
butzou
and
me
apparently
lifeless
carried
us
to
the
royal
palace
where
all
was
commotion
and
distraction
but
the
followed
the
track
which
the
conspirators
had
taken
in
one
of
the
streets
they
found
the
king
hat
dyed
in
blood
and
his
pelisse
also
this
confirmed
their
apprehensions
of
his
death
and
they
came
back
filling
all
warsaw
with
dismay
the
assassins
meanwhile
got
clear
of
the
town
finding
however
that
the
king
by
loss
of
blood
was
not
likely
to
exist
much
longer
by
dragging
him
towards
their
employer
and
that
delay
might
even
lose
them
his
dead
body
they
mounted
him
and
redoubled
their
speed
when
they
came
to
the
moat
they
compelled
him
to
leap
his
horse
across
it
in
the
attempt
the
horse
fell
and
broke
its
leg
they
then
ordered
his
majesty
fainting
as
he
was
to
mount
another
and
spur
it
over
the
conspirators
had
no
sooner
passed
the
ditch
and
saw
their
king
fall
insensible
on
the
neck
of
his
horse
than
they
tore
from
his
breast
the
ribbon
of
the
black
eagle
and
its
diamond
cross
lukawski
was
so
foolishly
sure
of
his
prisoner
dead
or
alive
that
he
quitted
his
charge
and
repaired
with
these
spoils
to
pulaski
meaning
to
show
them
as
proofs
of
his
success
many
of
the
other
plunderers
concluding
that
they
could
not
do
better
than
follow
their
leader
example
fled
also
tired
of
their
work
leaving
only
seven
of
the
party
with
kosinski
at
their
head
to
remain
over
the
unfortunate
stanislaus
who
shortly
after
recovered
from
his
swoon
the
night
was
now
grown
so
dark
they
could
not
be
sure
of
their
way
and
their
horses
stumbling
at
every
step
over
stumps
of
trees
and
hollows
in
the
earth
increased
their
apprehensions
to
such
a
degree
that
they
obliged
the
king
to
keep
up
with
them
on
foot
he
literally
marked
his
path
with
his
blood
his
shoes
having
been
torn
off
in
the
struggle
at
the
carriage
thus
they
continued
wandering
backward
and
forward
and
round
the
outskirts
of
warsaw
without
any
exact
knowledge
of
their
situation
the
men
who
guarded
him
at
last
became
so
afraid
of
their
prisoner
taking
advantage
of
these
circumstances
to
escape
that
they
repeatedly
called
on
kosinski
for
orders
to
put
him
to
death
kosinski
refused
but
their
demands
growing
more
imperious
as
the
intricacies
of
the
forest
involved
them
completely
the
king
expected
every
moment
to
find
their
bayonets
in
his
breast
meanwhile
continued
the
palatine
when
i
recovered
from
my
swoon
in
the
palace
my
leg
had
been
bound
up
and
i
felt
able
to
stir
questioning
the
officers
who
stood
about
my
couch
i
found
that
a
general
panic
had
seized
them
they
knew
not
how
to
proceed
they
shuddered
at
leaving
the
king
to
the
mercy
of
the
confederates
and
yet
were
fearful
by
pursuing
him
further
to
incense
them
through
terror
or
revenge
to
massacre
their
prisoner
if
he
were
still
alive
i
did
all
that
was
in
my
power
to
dispel
this
last
dread
anxious
at
any
rate
to
make
another
attempt
to
preserve
him
though
i
could
not
ride
myself
i
strenuously
advised
an
immediate
pursuit
on
horseback
and
insisted
that
neither
darkness
nor
apprehension
of
increasing
danger
should
be
permitted
to
impede
their
course
recovered
presence
of
mind
in
the
nobles
restored
hope
and
animation
to
the
terrified
soldiers
and
my
orders
were
obeyed
but
i
must
add
they
were
soon
disappointed
for
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
detachment
returned
in
despair
showing
me
his
majesty
coat
which
they
had
found
in
the
fosse
i
suppose
the
ruffians
tore
it
off
when
they
rifled
him
it
was
rent
in
several
places
and
so
wet
with
blood
that
the
officer
who
presented
it
to
me
concluded
they
had
murdered
the
king
there
and
drawn
away
his
body
for
by
the
light
of
the
torches
the
soldiers
could
trace
drops
of
blood
to
a
considerable
distance
whilst
i
was
attempting
to
invalidate
this
new
evidence
of
his
majesty
being
beyond
the
reach
of
succor
he
was
driven
before
the
seven
conspirators
so
far
into
the
wood
of
bielany
that
not
knowing
whither
they
went
they
came
up
with
one
of
the
and
to
their
extreme
terror
were
accosted
by
a
patrol
four
of
the
banditti
immediately
disappeared
leaving
two
only
with
kosinski
who
much
alarmed
forced
his
prisoner
to
walk
faster
and
keep
a
profound
silence
notwithstanding
all
this
precaution
scarce
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
they
were
challenged
by
a
second
watch
and
the
other
two
men
taking
flight
kosinski
full
of
indignation
at
their
desertion
was
left
alone
with
the
king
his
majesty
sinking
with
pain
and
fatigue
besought
permission
to
rest
for
a
moment
but
kosinski
refused
and
pointing
his
sword
towards
the
king
compelled
him
to
proceed
as
they
walked
on
the
insulted
monarch
who
was
hardly
able
to
drag
one
limb
after
the
other
observed
that
his
conductor
gradually
forgot
his
vigilance
until
he
was
thoroughly
given
up
to
thought
the
king
conceived
some
hope
from
this
change
and
ventured
to
say
see
that
you
know
not
how
to
proceed
you
can
not
but
be
aware
that
the
enterprise
in
which
you
are
engaged
however
it
may
end
is
full
of
peril
to
you
successful
conspirators
are
always
jealous
of
each
other
pulaski
will
find
it
as
easy
to
rid
himself
of
your
life
as
it
is
to
take
mine
avoid
that
danger
and
i
will
promise
you
none
on
my
account
suffer
me
to
enter
the
convent
of
bielany
we
can
not
be
far
from
it
and
then
do
you
provide
for
your
own
safety
kosinski
though
rendered
desperate
by
the
circumstances
in
which
he
was
involved
replied
i
have
sworn
and
i
would
rather
sacrifice
my
life
than
my
honor
the
king
had
neither
strength
nor
spirits
to
urge
him
further
and
they
continued
to
break
their
way
through
the
bewildering
underwood
until
they
approached
mariemont
here
stanislaus
unable
to
stir
another
step
sunk
down
at
the
foot
of
the
old
and
again
implored
for
one
moment
rest
kosinski
no
longer
refused
this
unexpected
humanity
encouraged
his
majesty
to
employ
the
minutes
they
sat
together
in
another
attempt
to
soften
his
heart
and
to
convince
him
that
the
oath
which
he
had
taken
was
atrocious
and
by
no
means
binding
to
a
brave
and
virtuous
man
kosinski
heard
him
with
attention
and
even
showed
he
was
affected
said
he
i
should
assent
to
what
you
propose
and
reconduct
you
to
warsaw
what
will
be
the
consequence
to
me
i
shall
be
taken
and
executed
give
you
my
word
answered
the
king
you
shall
not
suffer
any
injury
but
if
you
doubt
my
honor
escape
while
you
can
i
shall
find
some
place
of
shelter
and
will
direct
your
pursuers
to
take
the
opposite
road
to
that
which
you
may
choose
kosinski
entirely
overcome
threw
himself
on
his
knees
before
his
majesty
and
imploring
pardon
from
heaven
for
what
he
had
done
swore
that
from
this
hour
he
would
defend
his
king
against
all
the
conspirators
and
trust
confidently
in
his
word
for
future
preservation
stanislaus
repeated
his
promise
of
forgiveness
and
protection
and
directed
him
to
seek
refuge
for
them
both
in
the
mill
near
which
they
were
discoursing
kosinski
obeyed
he
knocked
but
no
one
gave
answer
he
then
broke
a
pane
of
glass
in
the
window
and
through
it
begged
succor
for
a
nobleman
who
had
been
waylaid
by
robbers
the
miller
refused
to
come
out
or
to
let
the
applicants
in
expressing
his
belief
that
they
were
robbers
themselves
and
if
they
did
not
go
away
he
would
fire
on
them
this
dispute
had
continued
some
time
when
the
king
contrived
to
crawl
up
close
to
the
windows
and
spoke
good
friend
said
he
we
were
banditti
as
you
suppose
it
would
be
as
easy
for
us
without
all
this
parley
to
break
into
your
house
as
to
break
this
pane
of
glass
therefore
if
you
would
not
incur
the
shame
of
suffering
a
to
perish
for
want
of
assistance
give
us
admittance
this
plain
argument
had
its
weight
upon
the
man
and
opening
the
door
he
desired
them
to
enter
after
some
trouble
his
majesty
procured
pen
and
ink
and
addressing
a
few
lines
to
me
at
the
palace
with
difficulty
prevailed
on
one
of
the
miller
sons
to
carry
it
so
fearful
were
they
of
falling
in
with
any
of
the
troop
who
they
understood
had
plundered
their
guests
my
joy
at
the
sight
of
this
note
i
can
not
describe
i
well
remember
the
contents
they
were
literally
these
the
miraculous
hand
of
providence
i
have
escaped
from
the
hands
of
assassins
i
am
now
at
the
mill
of
mariemont
send
immediately
and
take
me
hence
i
am
wounded
but
not
dangerously
regardless
of
my
own
condition
i
instantly
got
into
a
carriage
and
followed
by
a
detachment
of
horse
arrived
at
the
mill
i
met
kosinski
at
the
door
keeping
guard
with
his
sword
drawn
as
he
knew
my
person
he
admitted
me
directly
the
king
had
fallen
into
a
sleep
and
lay
in
one
corner
of
the
hovel
on
the
ground
covered
with
the
miller
cloak
to
see
the
most
virtuous
monarch
in
the
world
thus
abused
by
a
party
of
ungrateful
subjects
pierced
me
to
the
heart
kneeling
down
by
his
side
i
took
hold
of
his
hand
and
in
a
paroxysm
of
tears
which
i
am
not
ashamed
to
confess
i
exclaimed
thank
thee
almighty
god
that
i
again
see
our
sovereign
still
alive
it
is
not
easy
to
say
how
these
words
struck
the
simple
family
they
dropped
on
their
knees
before
the
king
whom
my
voice
had
awakened
and
besought
his
pardon
for
their
recent
opposition
to
give
him
entrance
the
good
stanislaus
soon
quieted
their
fears
and
graciously
thanking
them
for
their
kindness
told
the
miller
to
come
to
the
palace
the
next
day
when
he
would
show
him
his
gratitude
in
a
better
way
than
by
promises
the
officers
of
the
detachment
then
assisted
his
majesty
and
myself
into
the
carriage
and
accompanied
by
kosinski
we
reached
warsaw
about
six
in
the
morning
yes
interrupted
butzou
i
remember
my
tumultuous
joy
when
the
news
was
brought
to
me
in
my
bed
that
my
brave
brother
had
not
died
in
vain
for
his
sovereign
it
almost
deprived
me
of
my
senses
and
besides
his
majesty
visited
me
his
poor
soldier
in
my
chamber
does
not
your
excellency
recollect
how
he
was
brought
into
my
room
on
a
chair
between
two
men
and
how
he
thanked
me
and
shook
hands
with
me
and
told
me
my
brother
should
never
be
forgotten
in
poland
it
made
me
weep
like
a
child
and
he
never
can
cried
thaddeus
hardly
recovering
from
the
deep
attention
with
which
he
had
listened
to
this
recital
footnote
the
king
had
his
brave
defender
buried
with
military
honors
and
caused
a
noble
monument
to
be
raised
over
him
with
an
inscription
of
which
the
following
is
a
translation
here
lieth
the
respected
remains
of
george
butzou
who
on
the
of
september
opposing
his
own
breast
to
shield
his
sovereign
from
the
weapons
of
national
parricides
was
pierced
with
a
mortal
wound
and
triumphantly
expired
stanislaus
the
king
lamenting
the
death
of
so
faithful
a
subject
erects
this
monument
as
a
tribute
to
him
and
an
example
of
heroic
duty
to
others
but
what
became
of
kosinski
for
doubtless
the
king
kept
his
word
he
did
indeed
replied
sobieski
his
word
is
at
all
times
sacred
yet
i
believe
kosinski
entertained
fears
that
he
would
not
be
so
generous
for
i
perceived
him
change
color
very
often
while
we
were
in
the
coach
however
he
became
tranquillized
when
his
majesty
on
alighting
at
the
palace
in
the
midst
of
the
joyous
cries
of
the
people
leaned
upon
his
arm
and
presented
him
to
the
populace
as
his
preserver
the
great
gate
was
ordered
to
be
left
open
and
never
whilst
i
live
shall
i
again
behold
such
a
scene
every
loyal
soul
in
warsaw
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
came
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
their
rescued
sovereign
seeing
the
doors
free
they
entered
without
ceremony
and
thronged
forward
in
crowds
to
get
near
enough
to
kiss
his
hand
or
to
touch
his
clothes
then
elated
with
joy
they
turned
to
kosinski
and
loaded
him
with
demonstrations
of
gratitude
calling
him
the
of
the
king
kosinski
bore
all
this
with
surprising
firmness
but
in
a
day
or
two
when
the
facts
became
known
he
feared
he
might
meet
with
different
treatment
from
the
people
and
therefore
petitioned
his
majesty
for
leave
to
depart
stanislaus
consented
and
he
retired
to
semigallia
where
he
now
lives
on
a
handsome
pension
from
the
king
generous
stanislaus
exclaimed
the
general

my

young

how
he
has
rewarded
me
for
doing
that
which
was

my
duty

put
it
at

become

i
have
ever

all
my

vowed
in
my
own
mind
never
to
quit
it
and
accordingly
begged
permission
of
my
sovereign
to
remain
with
the

my

pride

the

of
the
veteran
between
both

regarded
him
with

very
countries

daring

applauded
his
spirit
and
was
warmly
seconded
by
the
palatine
who
never
weary
of
infusing
into
every
feeling
of
his
grandson
an
interest
for
his
country

the
discourse
and
dwelt

happy
tendency

in

of
which
they
were
now
going

their

sobieski
pointed
out
its
several
excellences
and
expatiated
on
the
pure
spirit
of
freedom
which
animated
its
revived
laws
the
soul
of
thaddeus
followed
his
eloquence
with
all
the
fervor
of
youth
forgetting
his
late
domestic
regrets
in
the
warm
aspirations
of
patriotic
hopes
and
at
noon
on
the
third
day
with
smiling
eyes
he
saw
his
grandfather
put
himself
at
the
head
of
his
battalions
and
commence
a
rapid
march
chapter
iii
the
opening
of
the
campaign
the
little
army
of
the
palatine
passed
by
the
battlements
of
chelm
crossed
the
bug
into
the
plains
of
volhinia
and
impatiently
counted
the
leagues
over
those
vast
tracts
until
it
reached
the
borders
of
kiovia
when
the
column
at
the
head
of
which
thaddeus
was
stationed
descended
the
heights
of
lininy
and
the
broad
camp
of
his
countrymen
burst
upon
his
sight
his
heart
heaved
with
an
emotion
quite
new
to
him
he
beheld
with
admiration
the
regular
disposition
of
the
intrenchments
the
long
intersected
tented
streets
and
the
warlike
appearance
of
the
soldiers
whom
he
could
descry
even
at
that
distance
by
the
beams
of
a
bright
evening
sun
which
shone
upon
their
arms
in
half
an
hour
his
troops
descended
into
the
plain
where
meeting
those
of
the
palatine
and
general
butzou
the
three
columns
again
united
and
thaddeus
joined
his
grandfather
in
the
van

as
they
met
can

behold
such
a
sight

made
no
reply
but
giving
him
one
of
those
expressive
looks
of
approbation
which
immediately
makes
its
way
to
the
soul
commanded
the
troops
to
advance
with
greater
speed
in
a
few
minutes
they
reached
the
outworks
of
the
camp
and
entered
the
lines
the
eager
eyes
of
thaddeus
wandered
from
object
to
object
thrilling
with
that
delight
with
which
youth
beholds
wonders
and
anticipates
more
he
stopped
with
the
rest
of
the
party
before
a
tent

informed

belonged
to

they
were
met
in
the
vestibule
by
an
hussar
officer

most
commanding
appearance
sobieski
and
he
having
accosted
each
other
with
mutual
congratulations
the
palatine
turned
to
thaddeus
took
him
by
the
hand
and
presenting
him
to
his
friend
said
with
a
smile
here
my
dear
kosciusko
this
young
men
is
my
grandson
he
is
called
thaddeus
sobieski
and
i
trust
that
he
will
not
disgrace
either
of
our
names
kosciusko
embraced
the
young
count
and
with
a
hearty
pressure
of
his
hand
replied
thaddeus
if
you
resemble
your
grandfather
you
can
never
forget
that
the
only
king
of
poland
who
equalled
our
patriotic
stanislaus
was
a
sobieski
and
as
becomes
his
descendant
you
will
not
spare
your
best
blood
in
the
service
of
your
country
footnote
kosciusko
noble
of
birth
and
eminently
brave
in
spirit
had
learnt
the
practice
of
arms
in
his
early
youth
in
america
during
the
contest
between
the
british
colonies
there
and
the
mother
country
the
young
pole
with
a
few
of
his
early
compeers
in
the
great
military
college
at
warsaw
eager
to
measure
swords
in
an
actual
field
had
passed
over
seas
to
british
america
and
offering
their
services
to
the
independents
which
were
accepted
the
extraordinary
warlike
talents
of
kosciusko
were
speedily
honored
by
his
being
made
an
especial
to
general
washington
when
the
war
ended
in
the
peace
of
mutual
concessions
between
the
national
parent
and
its
children
on
a
distant
land
the
poles
returned
to
their
native
country
where
they
soon
met
circumstances
which
caused
them
to
redraw
their
swords
for
her
but
to
what
issue
was
yet
behind
the
floating
colors
of
a
soldier

as
kosciusko
finished
speaking
an
came
forward
to
lead
the
party
into
the
room
of
audience
prince
poniatowski
welcomed
the
palatine
and
his
suite
with
the
most
lively
expressions
of
pleasure
he
gave
thaddeus
whose
figure
and
manner
instantly
charmed
him
many
flattering
assurances
of
friendship
and
promised
that
he
would
appoint
him
to
the
first
post
of
honor
which
should
offer
after
detaining
the
palatine
and
his
grandson
half
an
hour
his
highness
withdrew
and
they
rejoined
kosciusko
who
conducted
them
to
the
quarter
where
the
masovian
soldiers
had
already
pitched
their
tents
the
officers
who
supped
with
sobieski
left
him
at
an
early
hour
that
he
might
retire
to
rest
but
thaddeus
was
neither
able
nor
inclined
to
benefit
by
their
consideration
he
lay
down
on
his
mattress
shut
his
eyes
and
tried
to
sleep
but
the
attempt
was
without
success
in
vain
he
turned
from
side
to
side
in
vain
he
attempted
to
restrict
his
thoughts
to
one
thing
at
once
his
imagination
was
so
roused
by
anticipating
the
scenes
in
which
he
was
to
become
an
actor
that
he
found
it
impossible
even
to
lie
still
his
spirits
being
quite
awake
he
determined
to
rise
and
to
walk
himself
drowsy
seeing
his
grandfather
sound
asleep
he
got
up
and
dressed
himself
quietly
then
stealing
gently
from
the
marquée
he
gave
the
word
in
a
low
whisper
to
the
guard
at
the
door
and
proceeded
down
the
lines
the
pitying
moon
seemed
to
stand
in
the
heavens
watching
the
awaking
of
those
heroes
who
the
next
day
might
sleep
to
rise
no
more
at
another
time
and
in
another
mood
such
might
have
been
his
reflections
but
now
he
pursued
his
walk
with
different
thoughts
no
meditations
but
those
of
pleasure
possessed
his
breast
he
looked
on
the
moon
with
transport
he
beheld
the
light
of
that
beautiful
planet
trailing
its
long
stream
of
glory
across
the
intrenchments
he
perceived
a
solitary
candle
here
and
there
glimmering
through
the
curtained
entrance
of
the
tents
and
thought
that
their
inmates
were
probably
longing
with
the
same
anxiety
as
himself
for
the
dawn
thaddeus
walked
slowly
on
sometimes
pausing
at
the
lonely
footfall
of
the
sentinel
or
answering
with
a
start
to
the
sudden
challenge
for
the
parole
then
lingering
at
the
door
of
some
of
these
canvas
dwellings
he
offered
up
a
prayer
for
the
brave
inhabitant
who
like
himself
had
quitted
the
endearments
of
home
to
expose
his
life
on
this
spot
a
bulwark
of
liberty
thaddeus
knew
not
what
it
was
to
be
a
soldier
by
profession
he
had
no
idea
of
making
war
a
trade
by
which
a
man
may
acquire
subsistence
and
perhaps
wealth
he
had
but
one
motive
for
appearing
in
the
field
and
one
for
leaving
it
to
repel
invasion
and
to
establish
peace
the
first
energy
of
his
mind
was
a
desire
to
maintain
the
rights
of
his
country
it
had
been
inculcated
into
him
when
an
infant
it
had
been
the
subject
of
his
morning
thoughts
and
nightly
dreams
it
was
now
the
passion
which
beat
in
every
artery
of
his
heart
yet
he
knew
no
honor
in
slaughter
his
glory
lay
in
defence
and
when
that
was
accomplished
his
sword
would
return
to
its
scabbard
unstained
by
the
blood
of
a
vanquished
or
invaded
people
on
these
principles
he
was
at
this
hour
full
of
enthusiasm
a
glow
of
triumph
flitted
over
his
cheek
for
he
had
felt
the
indulgences
of
his
mother
palace
had
left
her
maternal
arms
to
take
upon
him
the
toils
of
war
and
risk
an
existence
just
blown
into
enjoyment
a
noble
satisfaction
rose
in
his
mind
and
with
all
the
animation
which
an
inexperienced
and
raised
fancy
imparts
to
that
age
when
boyhood
breaks
into
man
his
soul
grasped
at
every
show
of
creation
with
the
confidence
of
belief
pressing
the
sabre
which
he
held
in
his
hand
to
his
lips
he
half
uttered
never
shall
this
sword
leave
my
arm
but
at
the
command
of
mercy
or
when
death
deprives
my
nerves
of
their
strength
morning
was
tinging
the
hills
which
bound
the
eastern
horizon
of
winnica
before
thaddeus
found
that
his
pelisse
was
wet
with
dew
and
that
he
ought
to
return
to
his
tent
hardly
had
he
laid
his
head
upon
the
pillow
and
lulled
his
senses
in
forgetfulness
when
he
was
disturbed
by
the
drum
beating
to
arms
he
opened
his
eyes
and
seeing
the
palatine
out
of
bed
he
sprung
from
his
own
and
eagerly
inquired
the
cause
of
his
alarm
only
follow
me
directly
answered
his
grandfather
and
quitted
the
tent
whilst
thaddeus
was
putting
on
his
clothes
and
buckling
on
his
arms
with
a
trembling
eagerness
which
almost
defeated
his
haste
an
of
the
prince
entered
he
brought
information
that
an
advanced
guard
of
the
russians
had
attacked
a
polish
outpost
under
the
command
of
colonel
lonza
and
that
his
highness
had
ordered
a
detachment
from
the
palatine
brigade
to
march
to
its
relief
before
thaddeus
could
reply
sobieski
sent
to
apprise
his
grandson
that
the
prince
had
appointed
him
to
accompany
the
troops
which
were
turning
out
to
resist
the
enemy
thaddeus
heard
this
message
with
delight
yet
fearful
in
what
manner
the
event
might
answer
the
expectations
which
this
wished
distinction
declared
he
issued
from
his
tent
like
a
youthful
mars
or
rather
like
the
spartan
isadas
trembling
at
the
dazzling
effects
of
his
temerity
and
hiding
his
valor
and
his
blushes
beneath
the
waving
plumes
of
his
helmet
kosciusko
who
was
to
head
the
party
observed
this
modesty
with
pleasure
and
shaking
him
warmly
by
the
hand
said
go
thaddeus
take
your
station
on
the
left
flank
i
shall
require
your
fresh
spirits
to
lead
the
charge
i
intend
to
make
and
to
ensure
its
success
thaddeus
bowed
to
these
encouraging
words
and
took
his
place
according
to
order
everything
being
ready
the
detachment
quitted
the
camp
and
dashing
through
the
dews
of
a
sweet
morning
for
it
was
yet
may
in
a
few
hours
arrived
in
view
of
the
russian
battalions
lonza
who
from
the
only
redoubt
now
in
his
possession
caught
a
glimpse
of
this
welcome
reinforcement
rallied
his
few
remaining
men
and
by
the
time
that
kosciusko
came
up
contrived
to
join
him
in
the
van
the
fight
recommenced
thaddeus
at
the
head
of
his
hussars
in
full
gallop
bore
down
upon
the
enemy
right
flank
they
received
the
charge
with
firmness
but
their
young
adversary
perceiving
that
extraordinary
means
were
necessary
to
make
the
desired
effect
calling
on
his
men
to
follow
him
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
rushed
into
the
thickest
of
the
battle
his
soldiers
did
not
shrink
they
pressed
on
mowing
down
the
foremost
ranks
whilst
he
by
a
lucky
stroke
of
his
sabre
disabled
the
of
the
russian
and
seized
the
colors
his
own
troops
seeing
the
standard
in
his
hand
with
one
accord
in
loud
and
repeated
cries
shouted
victory
part
of
the
reserve
of
the
enemy
alarmed
at
this
outcry
gave
ground
and
retreating
with
precipitation
was
soon
followed
by
some
of
the
rear
ranks
of
the
centre
to
which
kosciusko
had
penetrated
while
its
commander
after
a
short
but
desperate
resistance
was
slain
the
left
flank
next
gave
way
and
though
holding
a
brave
stand
at
intervals
at
length
fairly
turned
about
and
fled
across
the
country
the
conquerors
elated
with
so
sudden
a
success
put
their
horses
on
full
speed
and
without
order
or
attention
pursued
the
fugitives
until
they
were
lost
amidst
the
trees
of
a
distant
wood
kosciusko
called
on
his
men
to
halt
but
he
called
in
vain
they
continued
their
career
animating
each
other
and
with
redoubled
shouts
drowned
the
voice
of
thaddeus
who
was
galloping
forward
repeating
the
command
at
the
entrance
of
the
wood
they
were
stopped
by
a
few
russian
stragglers
who
had
formed
themselves
into
a
body
these
men
withstood
the
first
onset
of
the
poles
with
considerable
steadiness
but
after
a
short
skirmish
they
fled
or
perhaps
seemed
to
fly
a
second
time
and
took
refuge
in
the
bushes
where
still
regardless
of
orders
their
enemies
followed
kosciusko
foreseeing
the
consequence
of
this
rashness
ordered
thaddeus
to
dismount
a
part
of
his
squadron
and
march
after
these
headstrong
men
into
the
forest
he
came
up
with
them
on
the
edge
of
a
heathy
tract
of
land
just
as
they
were
closing
in
with
a
band
of
the
enemy
arquebusiers
who
having
kept
up
a
quick
running
fire
as
they
retreated
had
drawn
their
pursuers
thus
far
into
the
thickets
heedless
of
anything
but
giving
their
enemy
a
complete
defeat
the
polanders
went
on
never
looking
to
the
left
nor
to
the
right
till
at
once
they
found
themselves
encompassed
by
two
thousand
muscovite
horse
several
battalions
of
chasseurs
and
in
front
of
fourteen
pieces
of
cannon
which
this
dreadful
ambuscade
opened
upon
them
thaddeus
threw
himself
into
the
midst
of
his
countrymen
and
taking
the
place
of
their
unfortunate
conductor
who
had
been
killed
in
the
first
sweep
of
the
artillery
prepared
the
men
for
a
desperate
stand
he
gave
his
orders
with
intrepid
coolness
though
under
a
shower
of
musketry
and
a
cannonade
which
carried
death
in
every
round
that
they
should
draw
off
towards
the
flank
of
the
battery
he
thought
not
of
himself
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
scattered
soldiers
were
consolidated
into
a
close
body
squared
with
pikemen
who
stood
like
a
grove
of
pines
in
a
day
of
tempest
only
moving
their
heads
and
arms
many
of
the
russian
horse
impaled
themselves
on
the
sides
of
this
little
phalanx
which
they
vainly
attempted
to
shake
although
the
ordnance
was
rapidly
weakening
its
strength
file
after
file
the
men
were
swept
down
their
bodies
making
a
horrid
rampart
for
their
resolute
brothers
in
arms
who
however
rendered
desperate
at
last
threw
away
their
most
cumbrous
accoutrements
and
crying
to
their
leader
freedom
or
death
followed
him
sword
in
hand
and
bearing
like
a
torrent
upon
the
enemy
ranks
cut
their
way
through
the
forest
the
russians
exasperated
that
their
prey
should
not
only
escape
but
escape
by
such
dauntless
valor
hung
closely
on
their
rear
goading
them
with
musketry
whilst
they
like
a
wounded
lion
closely
pressed
by
the
hunters
retreats
yet
stands
proudly
at
bay
gradually
retired
towards
the
camp
with
a
backward
step
their
faces
towards
the
foe
meanwhile
the
palatine
sobieski
anxious
for
the
fate
of
the
day
mounted
the
dyke
and
looked
eagerly
around
for
the
arrival
of
some
messenger
from
the
little
army
as
the
wind
blew
strongly
from
the
south
a
cloud
of
dust
precluded
his
view
but
from
the
approach
of
firing
and
the
clash
of
arms
he
was
led
to
fear
that
his
friends
had
been
defeated
and
were
retreating
towards
the
camp
he
instantly
quitted
the
lines
to
call
out
a
reinforcement
but
before
he
could
advance
kosciusko
and
his
squadron
on
the
full
charge
appeared
in
flank
of
the
enemy
who
suddenly
halted
and
wheeling
round
left
the
harassed
polanders
to
enter
the
trenches
unmolested
thaddeus
covered
with
dust
and
blood
flung
himself
into
his
grandfather
arms
in
the
heat
of
action
his
left
arm
had
been
wounded
by
a
cossack

aware
that
neglect
then
might
disable
him
from
further
service
at
the
moment
it
happened
he
bound
it
up
in
his
sash
and
had
thought
no
more
of
the
accident
until
the
palatine
remarked
blood
on
his
cloak
my
injury
is
slight
my
dear
sir
said
he
i
wish
to
heaven
that
it
were
all
the
evil
which
has
befallen
us
look
at
the
remnant
of
our
brave
comrades
sobieski
turned
his
eyes
on
the
panting
soldiers
and
on
kosciusko
who
was
inspecting
them
some
of
them
no
longer
upheld
by
desperation
were
sinking
with
wounds
and
fatigue
these
the
good
general
sent
off
in
litters
to
the
medical
department
and
others
who
had
sustained
unharmed
the
conflict
of
the
day
after
having
received
the
praise
and
admonition
of
their
commander
were
dismissed
to
their
quarters
before
this
inspection
was
over
the
palatine
had
to
assist
thaddeus
to
his
tent
in
spite
of
his
exertions
to
the
contrary
he
became
so
faint
it
was
necessary
to
lead
him
off
the
ground
a
short
time
restored
him
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
he
joined
his
brother
officers
on
the
fourth
day
after
the
duty
of
the
morning
he
heard
with
concern
that
during
his
confinement
the
enemy
had
augmented
their
force
to
so
tremendous
a
strength
it
was
impossible
for
the
comparatively
slender
force
of
the
poles
to
remain
longer
at
winnica
in
consequence
of
this
report
the
prince
had
convened
a
council
late
the
preceding
night
in
which
it
was
determined
that
the
camp
should
immediately
be
razed
and
removed
towards
zielime
this
information
displeased
thaddeus
who
in
his
fairy
dreams
of
war
had
always
made
conquest
the
sure
end
of
his
battles
and
many
were
the
sighs
he
drew
when
at
an
hour
before
dawn
on
the
following
day
he
witnessed
the
striking
of
the
tents
which
he
thought
too
like
a
prelude
to
a
shameful
flight
from
the
enemy
while
he
was
standing
by
the
busy
people
and
musing
on
the
nice
line
which
divides
prudence
from
pusillanimity
his
grandfather
came
up
and
bade
him
mount
his
horse
telling
him
that
owing
to
the
unhealed
state
of
his
wound
he
was
removed
from
the
vanguard
and
ordered
to
march
in
the
centre
along
with
the
prince
thaddeus
remonstrated
against
this
arrangement
and
almost
reproached
the
palatine
for
forfeiting
his
promise
that
he
should
always
be
stationed
near
his
person
the
veteran
would
not
be
moved
either
by
argument
or
entreaty
and
thaddeus
finding
that
he
neither
could
nor
ought
to
oppose
him
obeyed
and
followed
an
to
his
highness
chapter
iv
the
pass
of
volunna
after
a
march
of
three
hours
the
army
came
in
sight
of
volunna
where
the
advanced
column
suddenly
halted
thaddeus
who
was
about
a
half
mile
to
its
rear
with
a
throbbing
heart
heard
that
a
momentous
pass
must
be
disputed
before
they
could
proceed
he
curbed
his
horse
then
gave
it
the
spur
so
eagerly
did
he
wish
to
penetrate
the
cloud
of
smoke
which
rose
in
volumes
from
the
discharge
of
musketry
on
whose
wing
at
every
round
he
dreaded
might
be
carried
the
fate
of
his
grandfather
at
last
the
firing
ceased
and
the
troops
were
commanded
to
go
forward
on
approaching
near
the
contested
defile
thaddeus
shuddered
for
at
every
step
the
heels
of
his
charger
struck
upon
the
wounded
or
the
dead
there
lay
his
enemies
here
lay
his
friends
his
respiration
was
nearly
suspended
and
his
eyes
clung
to
the
ground
expecting
at
each
moment
to
fasten
on
the
breathless
body
of
his
grandfather
again
the
tumult
of
battle
presented
itself
about
an
hundred
soldiers
in
one
firm
rank
stood
at
the
opening
of
the
pass
firing
on
the
now
vacillating
steadiness
of
the
enemy
thaddeus
checked
his
horse
five
hundred
had
been
detached
to
this
post
how
few
remained
could
he
hope
that
sobieski
had
escaped
so
desperate
a
rencontre
fearing
the
worst
and
dreading
to
have
those
fears
confirmed
his
heart
sickened
when
he
received
orders
from
poniatowski
to
examine
the
extent
of
the
loss
he
rode
to
the
mouth
of
the
defile
he
could
nowhere
see
the
palatine
a
few
of
his
hussars
a
little
in
advance
were
engaged
over
a
heap
of
the
killed
defending
it
from
a
troop
of
cossacks
who
appeared
fighting
for
the
barbarous
privilege
of
trampling
on
the
bodies
at
this
sight
thaddeus
impelled
by
despair
called
out
courage
soldiers
the
prince
with
artillery
the
enemy
looking
forward
saw
the
information
was
true
and
with
a
shout
of
derision
took
to
flight
poniatowski
almost
at
the
word
was
by
the
side
of
his
young
friend
who
unconscious
of
any
idea
but
that
of
filial
solicitude
had
dismounted
where
is
the
palatine
was
his
immediate
inquiry
to
a
chasseur
who
was
stooping
towards
the
slain
the
man
made
no
answer
but
lifted
from
the
heap
the
bodies
of
two
soldiers
beneath
thaddeus
saw
the
pale
and
deathly
features
of
his
grandfather
he
staggered
a
few
paces
back
and
the
prince
thinking
he
was
falling
hastened
to
support
him
but
he
recovered
himself
and
flew
forward
to
assist
kosciusko
who
had
raised
the
head
of
the
palatine
upon
his
knee
is
he
alive
inquired
thaddeus
he
breathes
hope
was
now
warm
in
his
grandson
breast
the
soldiers
soon
released
sobieski
from
the
surrounding
dead
but
his
swoon
continuing
the
prince
desired
that
he
might
be
laid
on
a
bank
until
a
litter
could
be
brought
from
the
rear
to
convey
him
to
a
place
of
security
meantime
thaddeus
and
general
butzou
bound
up
his
wounds
and
poured
some
water
into
his
mouth
the
effusion
of
blood
being
stopped
the
brave
veteran
opened
his
eyes
and
in
a
few
moments
more
whilst
he
leaned
on
the
bosom
of
his
grandson
was
so
far
restored
as
to
receive
with
his
usual
modest
dignity
the
thanks
of
his
highness
for
the
intrepidity
with
which
he
had
preserved
a
passage
which
ensured
the
safety
of
the
whole
army
two
surgeons
who
arrived
with
the
litter
relieved
the
anxiety
of
the
bystanders
by
an
assurance
that
the
wounds
which
they
were
not
dangerous
having
laid
their
patient
on
the
vehicle
they
were
preparing
to
retire
with
it
into
the
rear
when
thaddeus
petitioned
the
prince
to
grant
him
permission
to
take
the
command
of
the
guard
which
was
appointed
to
attend
his
grandfather
his
highness
consented
but
sobieski
positively
refused
no
thaddeus
said
he
you
forget
the
effect
which
this
solicitude
about
so
trifling
a
matter
might
have
on
the
men
remember
that
he
who
goes
into
battle
only
puts
his
own
life
to
the
hazard
but
he
that
abandons
the
field
sports
with
the
lives
of
his
soldiers
do
not
give
them
leave
to
suppose
that
even
your
dearest
interest
could
tempt
you
from
the
front
of
danger
when
it
is
your
duty
to
remain
there
thaddeus
obeyed
his
grandfather
in
respectful
silence
at
seven
the
army
resumed
its
march
near
zielime
the
prince
was
saluted
by
a
reinforcement
it
appeared
very
seasonably
for
scouts
had
brought
information
that
directly
across
the
plain
a
formidable
division
of
the
russian
army
under
general
brinicki
was
drawn
up
in
order
of
battle
to
dispute
his
progress
thaddeus
for
the
first
time
shuddered
at
the
sight
of
the
enemy
should
his
friends
be
defeated
what
might
be
the
fate
of
his
grandfather
now
rendered
helpless
by
many
wounds
occupied
by
these
fears
with
anxiety
in
his
heart
he
kept
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
light
horse
close
to
the
hill
prince
poniatowski
ordered
the
lines
to
extend
themselves
that
the
right
should
reach
to
the
river
and
the
left
be
covered
by
the
rising
ground
on
which
were
mounted
seven
pieces
of
ordnance
immediately
after
these
dispositions
the
battle
commenced
with
mutual
determination
and
continued
with
unabated
fury
from
eight
in
the
morning
until
sunset
several
times
the
poles
were
driven
from
their
ground
but
as
often
recovering
themselves
and
animated
by
their
commanders
they
prosecuted
the
fight
with
advantage
general
brinicki
perceiving
that
the
fortune
of
the
day
was
going
against
him
ordered
up
the
body
of
reserve
which
consisted
of
four
thousand
men
and
several
cannon
he
erected
temporary
batteries
in
a
few
minutes
and
with
these
new
forces
opened
a
rapid
and
destructive
fire
on
the
polanders
kosciusko
alarmed
at
perceiving
a
retrograde
motion
in
his
troops
gave
orders
for
a
close
attack
on
the
enemy
in
front
whilst
thaddeus
at
the
head
of
his
hussars
should
wheel
round
the
hill
of
artillery
and
with
loud
cries
charge
the
opposite
flank
this
stratagem
succeeded
the
arquebusiers
who
were
posted
on
that
spot
seeing
the
impetuosity
of
the
poles
and
the
quarter
whence
they
came
supposed
them
to
be
a
fresh
squadron
gave
ground
and
opening
in
all
directions
threw
their
own
people
into
a
confusion
that
completed
the
defeat
kosciusko
and
the
prince
were
equally
successful
and
a
general
panic
amongst
their
adversaries
was
the
consequence
the
whole
of
the
russian
army
now
took
to
flight
except
a
few
regiments
of
carabineers
which
were
entangled
between
the
river
and
the
poles
these
were
immediately
surrounded
by
a
battalion
of
masovian
infantry
who
enraged
at
the
loss
their
body
had
sustained
the
preceding
day
answered
a
cry
for
quarter
with
reproach
and
derision
at
this
instant
the
sobieski
squadron
came
up
and
thaddeus
who
saw
the
perilous
situation
of
these
regiments
ordered
the
slaughter
to
cease
and
the
men
to
be
taken
prisoners
the
masovians
exhibited
strong
signs
of
dissatisfaction
at
such
commands
but
the
young
count
charging
through
them
ranged
his
troops
before
the
russians
and
declared
that
the
first
man
who
should
dare
to
lift
a
sword
against
his
orders
should
be
shot
the
poles
dropped
their
arms
the
poor
carabineers
fell
on
their
knees
to
thank
his
mercy
whilst
their
officers
in
a
sullen
silence
which
seemed
ashamed
of
gratitude
surrendered
their
swords
into
the
hands
of
their
deliverers
during
this
scene
only
one
very
young
russian
appeared
wholly
refractory
he
held
his
sword
in
a
menacing
posture
when
thaddeus
drew
near
and
before
he
had
time
to
speak
the
young
man
made
a
cut
at
his
head
which
a
hussar
parried
by
striking
the
assailant
to
the
earth
and
would
have
killed
him
on
the
spot
had
not
thaddeus
caught
the
blow
on
his
own
sword
then
instantly
dismounting
he
raised
the
officer
from
the
ground
and
apologized
for
the
too
hasty
zeal
of
his
soldier
the
youth
blushed
and
bowing
presented
his
sword
which
was
received
and
as
directly
returned
brave
sir
said
thaddeus
i
consider
myself
ennobled
in
restoring
this
weapon
to
him
who
has
so
courageously
defended
it
the
russian
made
no
reply
but
by
a
second
bow
and
put
his
hand
on
his
breast
which
seemed
wet
with
blood
ceremony
was
now
at
an
end
thaddeus
never
looked
upon
the
unfortunate
as
strangers
much
less
as
enemies
accosting
the
wounded
officer
with
a
friendly
voice
he
assured
him
of
his
services
and
bade
him
lean
on
him
overcome
the
young
man
incapable
of
speaking
accepted
his
assistance
but
before
a
conveyance
could
arrive
for
which
two
men
were
dispatched
he
fainted
in
his
arms
thaddeus
being
obliged
to
join
the
prince
with
his
prisoners
unwillingly
left
the
young
russian
in
this
situation
but
before
he
did
so
he
directed
one
of
his
lieutenants
to
take
care
that
the
surgeons
should
pay
attention
to
the
officer
and
have
his
litter
carried
next
to
the
palatine
during
the
remainder
of
the
march
when
the
army
halted
at
nine
preparations
were
made
to
fix
the
camp
and
in
case
of
a
surprise
from
any
part
of
the
dispersed
enemy
which
might
have
rallied
orders
were
delivered
for
throwing
up
a
dyke
thaddeus
having
been
assured
that
his
grandfather
and
the
wounded
russian
were
comfortably
stationed
near
each
other
did
not
hesitate
to
accept
the
command
of
the
intrenching
party
to
that
end
he
wrapped
himself
loosely
in
his
pelisse
and
prepared
for
a
long
watch
the
night
was
beautiful
it
being
the
month
of
june
a
softening
warmth
still
floated
through
the
air
as
if
the
moon
which
shone
over
his
head
emitted
heat
as
well
as
splendor
his
mind
was
in
unison
with
the
season
he
rode
slowly
round
from
bank
to
bank
sometimes
speaking
to
the
workers
in
the
fosse
sometimes
lingering
for
a
few
minutes
looking
on
the
ground
he
thought
on
the
element
of
which
he
was
composed
to
which
he
might
so
soon
return
then
gazing
upward
he
observed
the
silent
march
of
the
stars
and
the
moving
scene
of
the
heavens
on
whatever
object
he
cast
his
eyes
his
soul
which
the
recent
events
had
dissolved
into
a
temper
not
the
less
delightful
for
being
tinged
with
melancholy
meditated
with
intense
compassion
and
dwelt
with
wonder
on
the
mind
of
man
which
whilst
it
adores
the
creator
of
the
universe
and
measures
the
immensity
of
space
with
an
expansion
of
intellect
almost
divine
can
devote
itself
to
the
narrow
limits
of
sublunary
possessions
and
exchange
the
boundless
paradise
above
for
the
low
enjoyments
of
human
pride
he
looked
with
pity
over
that
wide
tract
of
land
which
now
lay
betwixt
him
and
the
remains
of
those
four
thousand
invaders
who
had
just
fallen
victims
to
the
insatiate
desires
of
ambition
he
well
knew
the
difference
between
a
defender
of
his
own
country
and
the
invader
of
another
his
heart
beat
his
soul
expanded
at
the
prospect
of
securing
liberty
and
life
to
a
virtuous
people
he
all
the
happiness
of
such
an
achievement
while
he
could
only
how
that
spirit
must
shrink
from
reflection
which
animates
the
slave
to
fight
not
merely
to
fasten
chains
on
others
but
to
rivet
his
own
the
closer
the
best
affections
of
man
having
put
the
sword
into
the
hand
of
thaddeus
his
principle
as
a
christian
did
not
remonstrate
against
his
passion
for
arms
when
he
was
told
the
fortifications
were
finished
he
retired
with
a
tranquil
step
towards
the
masovian
quarters
he
found
the
palatine
awake
and
eager
to
welcome
him
with
the
joyful
information
that
his
wounds
were
so
slight
as
to
promise
a
speedy
amendment
thaddeus
asked
for
his
prisoner
the
palatine
answered
that
he
was
in
the
next
tent
where
a
surgeon
closely
attended
him
who
had
already
given
a
very
favorable
opinion
of
the
wound
which
was
in
the
muscles
of
the
breast
have
you
seen
him
my
dear
sir
inquired
thaddeus
yes
replied
the
palatine
i
was
supported
into
his
marquée
before
i
retired
to
my
own
i
told
him
who
i
was
and
repeated
your
offers
of
service
he
received
my
proffer
with
expressions
of
gratitude
and
at
the
same
time
declared
he
had
nothing
to
blame
but
his
own
folly
for
bringing
him
to
the
state
in
which
he
now
lies
how
my
lord
rejoined
thaddeus
does
he
repent
of
being
a
soldier
or
is
he
ashamed
of
the
cause
for
which
he
fought
both
thaddeus
he
is
not
a
muscovite
but
a
young
englishman
an
englishman
and
raise
his
arm
against
a
country
struggling
for
loyalty
and
liberty
it
is
very
true
returned
the
palatine
but
as
he
confesses
it
was
his
folly
and
the
persuasions
of
others
which
impelled
him
he
may
be
pardoned
he
is
a
mere
youth
i
think
hardly
your
age
i
understand
that
he
is
of
rank
and
having
undertaken
a
tour
in
whatever
part
of
europe
is
now
open
to
travellers
under
the
direction
of
an
experienced
tutor
they
took
russia
in
their
route
at
petersburg
he
became
intimate
with
many
of
the
nobility
particularly
with
count
brinicki
at
whose
house
he
resided
and
when
the
count
was
named
to
the
command
of
the
army
in
poland
somerset
for
that
is
your
prisoner
name
instigated
by
his
own
volatility
and
the
arguments
of
his
host
volunteered
with
him
and
so
followed
his
friend
to
oppose
that
freedom
here
which
he
would
have
asserted
in
his
own
nation
thaddeus
thanked
his
grandfather
for
this
information
and
pleased
that
the
young
man
who
had
so
much
interested
him
was
a
brave
briton
not
in
heart
an
enemy
he
gayly
and
instantly
repaired
to
his
tent
a
generous
spirit
is
as
eloquent
in
acknowledging
benefits
as
it
is
bounteous
in
bestowing
them
and
somerset
received
his
preserver
with
the
warmest
demonstrations
of
gratitude
thaddeus
begged
him
not
to
consider
himself
as
particularly
obliged
by
a
conduct
which
every
soldier
of
honor
has
a
right
to
expect
from
another
the
englishman
bowed
his
head
and
thaddeus
took
a
seat
by
his
bedside
whilst
he
gathered
from
his
own
lips
a
corroboration
of
the
narrative
of
the
palatine
he
could
not
forbear
inquiring
how
a
person
of
his
apparent
candor
and
who
was
also
the
native
of
a
soil
where
national
liberty
had
so
long
been
the
palladium
of
its
happiness
could
volunteer
in
a
cause
the
object
of
which
was
to
make
a
brave
people
slaves
somerset
listened
to
these
questions
with
blushes
and
they
did
not
leave
his
face
when
he
confessed
that
all
he
could
say
in
extenuation
of
what
he
had
done
was
to
plead
his
youth
and
having
thought
little
on
the
subject
i
was
wrought
upon
continued
he
by
a
variety
of
circumstances
first
the
predilections
of
loftus
my
governor
are
strongly
in
favor
of
the
court
of
petersburg
secondly
my
father
dislikes
the
army
and
i
am
enthusiastically
fond
of
it
this
was
the
only
opportunity
perhaps
in
which
i
might
ever
satisfy
my
passion
and
lastly
i
believe
that
i
was
dazzled
by
the
picture
which
the
young
men
about
me
drew
of
the
campaign
i
longed
to
be
a
soldier
they
persuaded
me
and
i
followed
them
to
the
field
as
i
would
have
done
to
a
ballroom
heedless
of
the
consequences
yet
replied
thaddeus
smiling
from
the
intrepidity
with
which
you
maintained
your
ground
when
your
arms
were
demanded
any
one
might
have
thought
that
your
whole
soul
as
well
as
your
body
was
engaged
in
the
cause
to
be
sure
returned
somerset
i
was
a
blockhead
to
be
there
but
when
there
i
should
have
despised
myself
forever
had
i
given
up
my
honor
to
the
ruffians
who
would
have
wrested
my
sword
from
me
but
when
came
noble
sobieski
it
was
the
fate
of
war
and
i
confided
myself
to
a
brave
man
chapter
the
banks
of
the
vistula
each
succeeding
morning
not
only
brought
fresh
symptoms
of
recovery
to
the
two
invalids
but
condensed
the
mutual
admiration
of
the
young
men
into
a
solid
and
ardent
esteem
it
is
not
the
disposition
of
youthful
minds
to
weigh
for
months
and
years
the
sterling
value
of
those
qualities
which
attract
them
as
soon
as
they
see
virtue
they
respect
it
as
soon
as
they
meet
kindness
they
believe
it
and
as
soon
as
a
union
of
both
presents
itself
they
love
it
not
having
passed
through
the
disappointments
of
a
delusive
world
they
grasp
for
reality
every
pageant
which
appears
they
have
not
yet
admitted
that
cruel
doctrine
which
when
it
takes
effect
creates
and
extends
the
misery
it
affects
to
cure
whilst
we
give
up
our
souls
to
suspicion
we
gradually
learn
to
deceive
whilst
we
repress
the
fervors
of
our
own
hearts
we
freeze
those
which
approach
us
whilst
we
cautiously
avoid
occasions
of
receiving
pain
at
every
remove
we
acquire
an
unconscious
influence
to
inflict
it
on
those
who
follow
us
they
again
meet
from
our
conduct
and
lips
the
lesson
that
destroys
the
expanding
sensibilities
of
their
nature
and
thus
the
tormenting
chain
of
deceived
and
deceiving
characters
may
be
lengthened
to
infinitude
about
the
latter
end
of
the
month
sobieski
received
a
summons
to
court
where
a
diet
was
to
be
held
on
the
effect
of
the
victory
at
zielime
to
consider
of
future
proceedings
in
the
same
packet
his
majesty
enclosed
a
collar
and
investiture
of
the
order
of
stanislaus
as
an
acknowledgment
of
service
to
the
young
thaddeus
and
he
accompanied
it
with
a
note
from
himself
expressing
his
commands
that
the
young
knight
should
return
with
the
palatine
and
other
generals
to
receive
thanks
from
the
throne
thaddeus
half
wild
with
delight
at
the
thoughts
of
so
soon
meeting
his
mother
ran
to
the
tent
of
his
british
friend
to
communicate
the
tidings
somerset
participated
in
his
pleasure
and
with
reciprocal
warmth
accepted
the
invitation
to
accompany
him
to
villanow
i
would
follow
you
my
friend
said
he
pressing
the
hand
of
thaddeus
all
over
the
world
then
i
will
take
you
to
the
most
charming
spot
in
it
cried
he
villanow
is
an
eden
and
my
mother
the
dear
angel
would
make
a
desert
so
to
me
you
speak
so
rapturously
of
your
enchanted
castle
thaddeus
returned
his
friend
i
believe
i
shall
consider
my
in
being
fool
enough
to
trust
myself
amidst
a
fray
in
which
i
had
no
business
as
one
of
the
wisest
acts
of
my
life
i
consider
it
replied
thaddeus
as
one
of
the
most
auspicious
events
in
mine
before
the
palatine
quitted
the
camp
somerset
thought
it
proper
to
acquaint
loftus
who
was
yet
at
petersburg
of
the
particulars
of
his
late
danger
and
that
he
was
going
to
warsaw
with
his
new
friends
where
he
should
remain
for
several
weeks
he
added
that
as
the
court
of
poland
through
the
intercession
of
the
palatine
had
generously
given
him
his
liberty
he
should
be
able
to
see
everything
in
that
country
worthy
of
investigation
and
that
he
would
write
to
him
again
enclosing
letters
for
england
soon
after
his
arrival
at
the
polish
capital
the
weather
continuing
fine
in
a
few
days
the
party
left
zielime
and
the
palatine
and
somerset
being
so
far
restored
from
their
wounds
that
they
could
walk
the
one
with
a
crutch
and
the
other
by
the
support
of
his
friend
arm
they
went
through
the
journey
with
animation
and
pleasure
the
benign
wisdom
of
sobieski
the
intelligent
enthusiasm
of
thaddeus
and
the
playful
vivacity
of
somerset
mingling
their
different
natures
produced
such
a
beautiful
union
that
the
minutes
flew
fast
as
their
wishes
a
week
more
carried
them
into
the
palatinate
of
masovia
and
soon
afterwards
within
the
walls
of
villanow
everything
that
presented
itself
to
somerset
was
new
and
fascinating
he
saw
in
the
domestic
felicity
of
his
friend
scenes
which
reminded
him
of
the
social
harmony
of
his
own
home
he
beheld
in
the
palace
and
retinue
of
sobieski
all
the
magnificence
which
bespoke
the
descendant
of
a
great
king
and
a
power
which
wanted
nothing
of
royal
grandeur
but
the
crown
which
he
had
the
magnanimity
to
think
and
to
declare
was
then
placed
upon
a
more
worthy
brow
whilst
somerset
venerated
this
true
patriot
the
high
tone
his
mind
acquired
was
not
lowered
by
associating
with
characters
nearer
the
common
standard
the
friends
of
sobieski
were
men
of
tried
probity
men
who
at
all
times
preferred
their
country
welfare
before
their
own
peculiar
interest
somerset
day
after
day
listened
with
deep
attention
to
these
virtuous
and
energetic
noblemen
he
saw
them
full
of
fire
and
personal
courage
when
the
affairs
of
poland
were
discussed
and
he
beheld
with
admiration
their
perfect
forgetfulness
of
themselves
in
their
passion
for
the
general
good
in
these
moments
his
heart
bowed
down
before
them
and
all
the
pride
of
a
briton
distended
his
breast
when
he
thought
that
such
men
as
these
his
ancestors
were
he
remembered
how
often
their
chivalric
virtues
used
to
occupy
his
reflections
in
the
at
somerset
castle
and
his
doubts
when
he
compared
what
is
with
what
was
that
history
had
glossed
over
the
actions
of
past
centuries
or
that
a
different
order
of
men
lived
then
from
those
which
now
inhabit
the
world
thus
studying
the
sublime
characters
of
sobieski
and
his
friends
and
enjoying
the
endearing
kindness
of
thaddeus
and
his
mother
did
a
fortnight
pass
away
without
his
even
recollecting
the
promise
of
writing
to
his
governor
at
the
end
of
that
period
he
stole
an
hour
from
the
countess
society
and
enclosed
in
a
short
letter
to
loftus
the
following
epistle
to
his
mother
to
lady
somerset
somerset
castle
leicestershire
many
weeks
ago
my
dearest
mother
i
wrote
a
letter
of
seven
sheets
from
the
banks
of
the
neva
which
long
ere
this
time
you
and
my
dear
father
must
have
received
i
attempted
to
give
you
some
idea
of
the
manners
of
russia
and
my
vanity
whispers
that
i
succeeded
tolerably
well
the
court
of
the
famous
catharine
and
the
attentions
of
the
hospitable
count
brinicki
were
then
the
subjects
of
my
pen
but
how
shall
i
account
for
my
being
here
how
shall
i
allay
your
surprise
and
displeasure
on
seeing
that
this
letter
is
dated
from
warsaw
i
know
that
i
have
acted
against
the
wish
of
my
father
in
visiting
one
of
the
countries
he
proscribes
i
know
that
i
have
disobeyed
your
commands
in
ever
having
at
any
period
of
my
life
taken
up
arms
without
an
indispensable
necessity
and
i
have
nothing
to
allege
in
my
defence
i
fell
in
the
way
of
temptation
and
i
yielded
to
it
i
really
can
not
enumerate
all
the
things
which
induced
me
to
volunteer
with
my
russian
friends
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
did
so
and
that
we
were
defeated
by

thaddeus
sobieski
is
the
grandson
of
the
palatine
and
the
sole
heir
of
his
illustrious
race
it
is
to
him
that
i
owe
the
preservation
of
my
life
at
zielime
and
much
of
my
happiness
since
for
he
is
not
only
the
bravest
but
the
most
amiable
young
man
in
the
kingdom
and
he
is
my
friend
indeed
as
things
have
happened
you
must
think
that
out
of
evil
has
come
good
though
i
have
been
disobedient
i
have
repented
my
fault
and
it
has
introduced
me
to
the
knowledge
of
a
people
whose
friendship
will
henceforward
constitute
the
greatest
pleasure
of
my
days
the
mother
of
thaddeus
is
the
only
daughter
of
the
palatine
and
of
her
i
can
say
no
more
than
that
nothing
on
earth
can
more
remind
me
of
you
she
is
equally
charming
equally
tender
to
your
son
whilst
the
palatine
is
engaged
at
the
diet
her
excellency
thaddeus
and
myself
with
now
and
then
a
few
visitors
from
warsaw
form
the
most
agreeable
parties
you
can
suppose
we
walk
together
we
read
together
we
converse
together
we
sing
together
at
least
the
countess
sings
to
us
which
is
all
the
same
and
you
know
that
time
flies
swiftly
on
the
wings
of
harmony
she
has
an
uncommonly
sweet
voice
and
a
taste
which
i
never
heard
paralleled
by
the
way
you
can
not
imagine
anything
more
beautiful
than
the
polish
music
it
partakes
of
that
delicious
languor
so
distinguished
in
the
turkish
airs
with
a
mingling
of
those
wandering
melodies
which
the
forgotten
composers
must
have
caught
from
the
tartars
in
short
whilst
the
countess
is
singing
i
hardly
suffer
myself
to
breathe
and
i
feel
just
what
our
poetical
friend
william
scarsdale
said
a
twelvemonth
ago
at
a
concert
of
yours
feel
as
if
love
sat
upon
my
heart
and
flapped
it
with
his
wings
i
have
tried
all
my
powers
of
persuasion
to
prevail
on
this
charming
countess
to
visit
our
country
i
have
over
and
over
again
told
her
of
you
and
described
her
to
you
that
you
are
near
her
own
age
for
this
lovely
woman
though
she
has
a
son
nearly
twenty
is
not
more
than
forty
that
you
are
as
fond
of
your
ordinary
boy
as
she
is
of
her
peerless
one
that
in
short
you
and
my
father
will
receive
her
and
thaddeus
and
the
palatine
with
open
arms
and
hearts
if
they
will
condescend
to
visit
our
humbler
home
at
the
end
of
the
war
i
believe
i
have
repeated
my
entreaties
both
to
the
countess
and
my
friend
regularly
every
day
since
my
arrival
at
villanow
but
always
with
the
same
issue
she
smiles
and
refuses
and
thaddeus
his
ambrosial
curls
with
a
frown
of
denial
i
hope
it
is
in
compliment
to
his
mother
cruel
and
unprovoked
negative
before
i
proceed
i
must
give
you
some
idea
of
the
real
appearance
of
this
palace
i
recollect
your
having
read
a
superficial
account
of
it
in
a
few
slight
sketches
of
poland
which
have
been
published
in
england
but
the
pictures
they
exhibit
are
so
faint
they
hardly
resemble
the
original
pray
do
not
laugh
at
me
if
i
begin
in
the
usual
descriptive
style
you
know
there
is
only
one
way
to
describe
houses
and
lands
and
rivers
so
no
blame
can
be
thrown
on
me
for
taking
the
beaten
path
where
there
is
no
other
to
commence
when
we
left
zielime
and
advanced
into
the
province
of
masovia
the
country
around
praga
rose
at
every
step
in
fresh
beauty
the
numberless
chains
of
gently
swelling
hills
which
encompass
it
on
each
side
of
the
vistula
were
in
some
parts
checkered
with
corn
fields
meadows
and
green
pastures
covered
with
sheep
whose
soft
bleatings
thrilled
in
my
ears
and
transported
my
senses
into
new
regions
so
different
was
my
charmed
and
tranquillized
mind
from
the
tossing
anxieties
attendant
on
the
horrors
i
had
recently
witnessed
surely
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
short
of
the
most
undivided
reciprocal
attachment
that
has
such
power
over
the
workings
of
the
human
heart
as
the
mild
sweetness
of
nature
the
most
ruffled
temper
when
emerging
from
the
town
will
subside
into
a
calm
at
the
sight
of
a
wide
stretch
of
landscape
reposing
in
the
twilight
of
a
fine
evening
it
is
then
that
the
spirit
of
peace
settles
upon
the
heart
unfetters
the
thoughts
and
elevates
the
soul
to
the
creator
it
is
then
that
we
behold
the
parent
of
the
universe
in
his
works
we
see
his
grandeur
in
earth
sea
and
sky
we
feel
his
affection
in
the
emotions
which
they
raise
and
half
mortal
half
etherealized
forget
where
we
are
in
the
anticipation
of
what
that
world
must
be
of
which
this
earth
is
merely
the
shadow
footnote
this
description
of
the
banks
of
the
vistula
was
given
to
me
with
smiles
and
sighs
the
reality
was
once
enjoyed
by
the
narrator
and
there
was
a
delight
in
the
retrospection
sweet
and
mournful
to
the
soul
at
the
time
these
reflections
arose
on
such
a
scene
i
often
tasted
the
same
pleasure
in
evening
visits
to
the
beautiful
rural
environs
of
london
which
then
extended
from
the
north
side
of
fitzroy
square
to
beyond
the
elm
grove
on
primrose
hill
and
forward
through
the
fields
to
hampstead
but
most
of
that
is
all
streets
or
regent
park
and
the
sweet
hill
then
the
resort
of
many
a
happy
sunday
group
has
not
now
a
tree
standing
on
it
and
hardly
a
blade
of
grass
to
mark
where
the
primrose
has
been
autumn
seemed
to
be
unfolding
all
her
beauties
to
greet
the
return
of
the
palatine
in
one
part
the
haymakers
were
mowing
the
hay
and
heaping
it
into
stacks
in
another
the
reapers
were
gathering
up
the
wheat
with
a
troop
of
rosy
little
gleaners
behind
them
each
of
whom
might
have
tempted
the
proudest
palemon
in
christendom
to
have
changed
her
toil
into
gentler
duty
such
a
landscape

with
the
little
farms

these
honest
people
whom
the
philanthropy
of
sobieski
has
rendered
free
for
it

a
tract
of
his
extensive
domains

am
describing
reminded
me
of
somerset
villages

in
the
green
hollows
of
the
vales
and
cottages
are
seen
peeping
from
amidst
the
thick
umbrage
of
the
woods
which
cover
the
face
of
the
hills
the
irregular
forms
and
thatched
roofs
of
these
simple
habitations
with
their
infant
inhabitants
playing
at
the
doors
compose
such
lovely
groups
that
i
wish
for
our
dear
mary
pencil
and
fingers
for
alas
that
way
mine
are
motionless
to
transport
them
to
your
eyes
the
palace
of
villanow
which
is
castellated
now
burst
upon
my
view
it
rears
its
embattled
head
from
the
summit
of
a
hill
that
gradually
slopes
down
towards
the
vistula
in
full
view
to
the
south
of
the
plain
of
vola
a
spot
long
famous
for
the
election
of
the
kings
of
poland
footnote
it
was
from
this
very
assumption
by
the
nation
on
the
extinction
of
the
male
line
of
the
monarchs
of
the
house
of
jaghellon
that
all
their
subsequent
political
calamities
may
be
dated
the
last
two
sovereigns
of
this
race
were
most
justly
styled
good
and
great
kings
and
son
sigismund
and
ii
but
on
the
death
of
the
last
about
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
certain
nobles
of
the
nation
intoxicated
with
their
wealth
and
privileges
run
wild
for
dictation
in
all
things
and
as
the
foundation
for
such
rule
they
determined
to
make
the
succession
of
their
future
kings
entirely
dependent
on
the
free
vote
of
public
suffrage
and
the
plain
of
vola
was
made
the
terrible
arena
so
it
may
be
called
for
from
the
time
of
the
first
monarch
so
elected
henry
of
valois
a
stranger
to
the
country
and
brother
to
the
execrable
charles
ix
of
france
bribery
or
violence
have
been
the
usual
keys
to
the
throne
of
poland
for
the
doors
of
the
country
being
once
opened
by
the
misguided
people
themselves
to
the
influence
of
ambition
partiality
and
passion
and
shut
against
the
old
tenure
of
a
settled
succession
foreign
powers
were
always
ready
to
step
in
with
the
gold
or
the
sword
and
poland
necessarily
became
a
vassal
adjunct
to
whatever
neighboring
country
furnished
the
new
sovereign
thus
it
was
with
a
few
exceptions
as
is
still
case
of
the
glorious
john
sobieski
until
the
election
of
stanislaus
augustus
who
though
nominated
by
the
power
of
the
empress
of
russia
yet
being
like
sobieski
a
native
prince
of
the
nation
determined
to
govern
the
people
of
poland
in
the
spirit
of
his
and
their
most
glorious
ancestors
and
true
to
the
vow
treading
in
the
steps
of
the
last
of
the
jaghellons
he
gave
to
poland
the
constitution
of
which
with
the
of
many
wise
laws
again
made
the
throne
hereditary
hence
the
devoted
struggles
of
every
arm
in
the
country
in
loyal
defence
of
such
a
recovered
existence
on
the
north
of
the
building
the
earth
is
cut
into
natural
ramparts
which
rise
in
high
succession
until
they
reach
the
foundations
of
the
palace
where
they
terminate
in
a
noble
terrace
these
ramparts
covered
with
grass
overlook
the
stone
outworks
and
spread
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
which
being
clothed
with
fine
trees
and
luxuriant
underwood
forms
such
a
rich
and
verdant
base
to
the
fortress
as
i
have
not
language
to
describe
were
i
privileged
to
be
poetical
i
would
say
it
reminds
me
of
the
god
of
war
sleeping
amid
roses
in
the
bower
of
love
here
the
eye
may
wander
over
the
gifts
of
bounteous
nature
arraying
hill
and
dale
in
all
the
united
treasures
of
spring
and
autumn
the
forest
stretches
its
yet
unseared
arms
to
the
breeze
whilst
that
breeze
comes
laden
with
the
fragrance
of
the
tented
hay
and
the
thousand
sweets
breathed
from
flowers
which
in
this
delicious
country
weep
honey
a
magnificent
flight
of
steps
led
us
from
the
foot
of
the
ramparts
up
to
the
gate
of
the
palace
we
entered
it
and
were
presently
surrounded
by
a
train
of
attendants
in
such
sumptuous
liveries
than
i
found
myself
all
at
once
carried
back
into
the
fifteenth
century
and
might
have
fancied
myself
within
the
courtly
halls
of
our
tudors
and
plantagenets
you
can
better
conceive
that
i
can
paint
the
scene
which
took
place
between
the
palatine
the
countess
and
her
son
i
can
only
repeat
that
from
that
hour
i
have
known
no
want
of
happiness
but
what
arises
from
regret
that
my
dear
family
are
not
partakers
with
me
you
know
that
this
stupendous
building
was
the
favorite
residence
of
john
sobieski
and
that
he
erected
it
as
a
from
the
labors
of
his
long
and
glorious
reign
i
can
not
move
without
meeting
some
vestige
of
that
truly
great
monarch
i
sleep
in
his
bed
chamber
there
hangs
his
portrait
dressed
in
the
robes
of
sovereignty
here
are
suspended
the
arms
with
which
he
saved
the
very
kingdoms
which
have
now
met
together
to
destroy
his
country
on
one
side
is
his
library
on
the
other
the
little
chapel
in
which
he
used
to
pay
his
morning
and
evening
devotions
wherever
i
look
my
eye
finds
some
object
to
excite
my
reflections
and
emulation
the
noble
dead
seem
to
address
me
from
their
graves
and
i
blush
at
the
inglorious
life
i
might
have
pursued
had
i
never
visited
this
house
and
its
inhabitants
yet
my
dearest
mother
i
do
not
mean
to
insinuate
that
my
honored
father
and
brave
ancestors
have
not
set
me
examples
as
bright
as
man
need
follow
but
human
nature
is
capricious
we
are
not
so
easily
stimulated
by
what
is
always
in
our
view
as
with
sights
which
rising
up
when
we
are
removed
from
our
customary
associations
surprise
and
captivate
our
attention
villanow
has
only
awakened
me
to
the
lesson
which
i
conned
over
in
drowsy
carelessness
at
home
thaddeus
sobieski
is
hardly
one
year
my
senior
but
good
heaven
what
has
he
not
done
what
has
he
not
acquired
whilst
i
abused
the
indulgence
of
my
parents
and
wasted
my
days
in
riding
shooting
and
walking
the
streets
he
was
learning
to
act
as
became
a
man
of
rank
and
virtue
and
by
seizing
every
opportunity
to
serve
the
state
he
has
obtained
a
rich
reward
in
the
respect
and
admiration
of
his
country
i
am
not
envious
but
i
now
feel
the
truth
of
speech
when
he
declared
reputation
of
alexander
would
not
let
him
sleep
nevertheless
i
dearly
love
my
friend
i
murmur
at
my
own
dements
not
at
his
worth
i
have
scribbled
over
all
my
paper
otherwise
i
verily
believe
i
should
write
more
however
i
promise
you
another
letter
in
a
week
or
two
meanwhile
i
shall
send
this

written
three
weeks
after
the
preceding
you
know
my
dear
mother
that
your
pembroke
is
famous
for
his
ingenious
mode
of
showing
the
full
value
of
every
favor
he
confers
can
i
then
relinquish
the
temptation
of
telling
you
what
i
have
left
to
make
you
happy
with
this
epistle
about
five
minutes
ago
i
was
sitting
on
the
lawn
at
the
feet
of
the
countess
reading
to
her
and
the
princess
poniatowski
the
charming
poem
of
pleasures
of
memory
as
both
these
ladies
understand
english
they
were
admiring
it
and
paying
many
compliments
to
the
graces
of
my
delivery
when
the
palatine
presented
himself
and
told
me
if
i
had
any
commands
for
petersburg
i
must
prepare
them
for
a
messenger
was
to
set
off
on
the
next
morning
by
daybreak
i
instantly
sprang
up
threw
my
book
into
the
hand
of
thaddeus
and
here
i
am
in
my
own
room
scribbling
to
you
even
at
the
moment
in
which
i
dip
my
pen
in
the
ink
my
hurrying
imagination
paints
on
my
heart
the
situation
of
my
beloved
home
when
this
letter
reaches
you
i
think
i
see
you
and
my
good
aunt
seated
on
the
blue
sofa
in
your
with
your
needle
work
on
the
little
table
before
you
i
see
mary
in
her
usual
nook
the
recess
by
the
old
harpsichord
and
my
dear
father
bringing
in
this
happy
letter
from
your
son
i
must
confess
this
romantic
kind
of
makes
me
feel
rather
oddly
very
unlike
what
i
felt
a
few
months
ago
when
i
was
a
mere
coxcomb
indifferent
unreflecting
unappreciating
and
fit
for
nothing
better
than
to
hold
pins
at
my
lady
toilet
well
it
is
now
made
evident
to
me
that
we
never
know
the
blessings
bestowed
on
us
until
we
are
separated
from
the
possession
of
them
absence
tightens
the
strings
which
unites
friends
as
well
as
lovers
at
least
i
find
it
so
and
though
i
am
in
the
fruition
of
every
good
on
this
side
the
ocean
yet
my
very
happiness
renders
me
ungrateful
and
i
repine
because
i
enjoy
it
alone
positively
i
must
bring
you
all
hither
to
pass
a
summer
or
come
back
at
the
termination
of
my
travels
and
carry
away
this
dear
family
by
main
force
to
england
tell
my
cousin
mary
that
either
way
i
shall
present
to
her
esteem
the
most
amiable
and
accomplished
of
my
sex
but
i
warn
her
not
to
fall
in
love
with
him
neither
in
nor
by
his
public
fame
nor
with
his
private
character
tell
her
is
a
bright
and
particular
star
neither
in
her
sphere
nor
in
any
other
woman
in
this
way
he
is
as
cold
as
crescent
and
to
my
great
amazement
too
for
when
i
throw
my
eyes
over
the
many
lovely
young
women
who
at
different
times
fill
the
of
the
countess
i
can
not
but
wonder
at
the
perfect
indifference
with
which
he
views
their
to
me
irresistible
charms
he
is
polite
and
attentive
to
them
all
he
talks
with
them
smiles
with
them
and
treats
them
with
every
gentle
complacency
but
they
do
not
live
one
instant
in
his
memory
i
mean
they
do
not
occupy
his
particular
wishes
for
with
regard
to
every
respectful
sentiment
towards
the
sex
in
general
and
esteem
to
some
amiable
individuals
he
is
as
awake
as
in
the
other
case
he
is
still
asleep
the
fact
is
he
has
no
idea
of
appropriation
he
never
casts
one
thought
upon
himself
kindness
is
spontaneous
in
his
nature
his
sunny
eyes
beam
on
all
with
modest
benignity
and
his
frank
and
glowing
conversation
is
directed
to
every
rank
of
people
they
imbibe
it
with
an
avidity
and
love
which
makes
its
way
to
his
heart
without
kindling
one
spark
of
vanity
thus
whilst
his
fine
person
and
splendid
actions
fill
every
eye
and
bosom
i
see
him
moving
in
the
circle
unconscious
of
his
eminence
and
the
admiration
he
excites
drawn
by
such
an
example
to
which
his
high
quality
as
well
as
extraordinary
merit
gives
so
great
an
influence
most
of
the
younger
nobility
have
been
led
to
enter
the
army
these
circumstances
added
to
the
detail
of
his
bravery
and
uncommon
talents
in
the
field
have
made
him
an
object
of
universal
regard
and
in
consequence
wherever
he
is
seen
he
meets
with
applause
and
acclamation
nay
even
at
the
appearance
of
his
carriage
in
the
streets
the
passengers
take
off
their
hats
and
pray
for
him
till
he
is
out
of
sight
it
is
only
then
that
i
perceive
his
cheek
flush
with
the
conviction
that
he
is
seated
in
their
hearts
is
this
thaddeus
said
i
to
him
one
day
when
walking
together
we
were
obliged
to
retire
into
a
house
from
the
crowds
that
followed
him
is
this
my
dear
friend
which
shields
your
heart
against
the
arrows
of
love
you
have
no
place
for
that
passion
your
mistress
is
glory
and
she
courts
you
mistress
is
my
country
replied
he
present
i
desire
no
other
for
her
i
would
die
for
her
only
would
i
wish
to
live
whilst
he
spoke
the
energy
of
his
soul
blazed
in
his
eye
i
smiled
are
an
enthusiast
thaddeus
i
said
returned
he
in
a
surprised
and
reproachful
tone
do
not
give
you
that
name
opprobriously
resumed
i
laughing
there
are
many
in
my
country
who
hearing
these
sentiments
would
not
scruple
to
call
you
mad
i
pity
them
returned
thaddeus
who
can
not
ardently
feel
can
not
taste
supreme
happiness
my
grandfather
educated
me
at
the
feet
of
patriotism
and
when
i
forget
his
precepts
and
example
may
my
guardian
angel
forget
me
glorious
thaddeus
cried
i
grasping
his
hand
i
envy
you
your
destiny
to
live
as
you
do
in
the
lap
of
honor
virtue
and
glory
the
aim
and
end
of
your
existence
the
animated
countenance
of
my
friend
changed
at
these
words
and
laying
his
hand
on
my
arm
he
said
not
envy
me
my
destiny
pembroke
you
are
the
son
of
a
free
and
loyal
country
at
peace
with
itself
insatiate
power
has
not
dared
to
invade
its
rights
your
king
in
happy
security
reigns
in
the
confidence
of
his
people
whilst
our
anointed
stanislaus
is
baited
and
insulted
by
oppression
from
without
and
ingratitude
within
do
not
envy
me
i
would
rather
live
in
obscurity
all
my
days
than
have
the
means
which
calamity
may
produce
of
acquiring
celebrity
over
the
ruins
of
poland
o
my
friend
the
wreath
that
crowns
the
head
of
conquest
is
thick
and
bright
but
that
which
binds
the
olive
of
peace
on
the
bleeding
wounds
of
my
country
will
be
the
dearest
to
me
such
sentiments
my
clear
madam
have
opened
new
lights
upon
my
poor
mistaken
faculties
i
never
considered
the
subject
so
maturely
as
my
friend
has
done
victory
and
glory
were
with
me
synonymous
words
i
had
not
learned
until
frequent
conversations
with
the
young
ardent
and
pious
sobieski
taught
me
how
to
discriminate
between
animal
courage
and
true
valor
between
the
defender
of
his
country
and
the
ravager
of
other
states
in
short
i
see
in
thaddeus
sobieski
all
that
my
fancy
hath
ever
pictured
of
the
heroic
character
whilst
i
contemplate
the
sublimity
of
his
sentiments
and
the
tenderness
of
his
soul
i
can
not
help
thinking
how
few
would
believe
that
so
many
admirable
qualities
could
belong
to
one
mind
and
that
mind
remain
unacquainted
with
the
throes
of
ambition
or
the
throbs
of
pembroke
judged
rightly
of
his
friend
for
if
ever
the
real
disinterested
glowed
in
the
breast
of
a
man
it
animated
the
heart
of
the
young
sobieski
at
the
termination
of
the
foregoing
sentence
in
the
letter
to
his
mother
pembroke
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
servant
who
presented
him
a
packet
which
had
that
moment
arrived
from
petersburg
he
took
it
and
putting
his
writing
materials
into
a
desk
read
the
following
epistle
from
his
governor
to
pembroke
somerset
esq
my
dear
sir
i
have
this
day
received
your
letter
enclosing
one
for
lady
somerset
you
must
pardon
me
that
i
have
detained
it
and
will
continue
to
do
so
until
i
am
favored
with
your
answer
to
this
for
which
i
shall
most
anxiously
wait
you
know
somerset
my
reputation
in
the
sciences
you
know
my
depth
in
the
languages
and
besides
the
marquis
of
inverary
with
whom
i
travelled
over
the
continent
offered
you
sufficient
credentials
respecting
my
knowledge
of
the
world
and
the
honorable
manner
in
which
i
treat
my
pupils
sir
robert
somerset
and
your
lady
mother
were
amply
satisfied
with
the
account
which
his
lordship
gave
of
my
character
but
with
all
this
in
one
point
every
man
is
vulnerable
no
scholar
can
forget
those
lines
of
the
poet
ter
et
amplius
quos
irrupta
tenet
copula
nec
malis
divulsus
quærimoniis
supremâ
citius
solvet
amor
die
it
has
been
my
misfortune
that
i
have
felt
them
you
are
not
ignorant
that
i
was
known
to
the
brinicki
family
when
i
had
the
honor
of
conducting
the
marquis
through
russia
the
accomplished
kinswoman
the
amiable
and
learned
widow
of
baron
surowkoff
even
then
took
particular
notice
of
me
and
when
i
returned
with
you
to
petersburg
i
did
not
find
that
my
short
absence
had
obliterated
me
from
her
memory
you
are
well
acquainted
with
the
dignity
of
that
lady
opinions
on
political
subjects
she
and
i
coincided
in
ardor
for
the
consolidating
cause
of
sovereignty
and
in
hatred
of
that
levelling
power
which
pervades
all
europe
many
have
been
the
long
and
interesting
conversations
we
have
held
together
on
the
prosecution
of
the
grand
schemes
of
the
three
great
contracting
monarchs
the
baroness
i
need
not
observe
is
as
handsome
as
she
is
ingenuous
her
understanding
is
as
masculine
as
her
person
is
desirable
and
i
had
been
more
or
less
than
man
had
i
not
understood
that
my
figure
and
talents
were
agreeable
to
her
i
can
not
say
that
she
absolutely
promised
me
her
hand
but
she
went
as
far
that
way
as
delicacy
would
permit
i
am
thus
circumstantial
somerset
to
show
you
that
i
do
not
proceed
without
proof
she
has
repeatedly
said
in
my
presence
that
she
would
never
marry
any
man
unless
he
were
not
only
but
of
the
profoundest
erudition
united
with
an
acquaintance
with
men
and
manners
which
none
can
dispute
added
she
must
not
differ
with
me
one
tittle
in
politics
for
on
that
head
i
hold
myself
second
to
no
man
or
woman
in
europe
and
then
she
has
complimented
me
by
declaring
that
i
possessed
more
judicious
sentiments
on
government
than
any
man
in
petersburg
and
that
she
should
consider
herself
happy
on
the
first
vacancy
in
the
imperial
college
to
introduce
me
at
court
where
she
was
the
empress
would
at
once
discover
the
value
of
my
talents
but
she
continued
such
a
case
i
will
not
allow
that
even
her
majesty
shall
rival
me
in
your
esteem
the
modesty
natural
to
my
character
told
me
that
these
praises
must
have
some
other
source
than
my
comparatively
unequal
abilities
and
i
unequivocally
found
it
in
the
partiality
with
which
her
ladyship
condescended
to
regard
me
was
i
to
blame
somerset
would
not
any
man
of
sensibility
and
honor
have
comprehended
such
advances
from
a
woman
of
her
rank
and
reputation
i
could
not
be
mistaken
her
looks
and
words
needed
no
explanation
which
my
judgment
could
not
pronounce
though
i
am
aware
that
i
do
not
possess
that
purpureum
which
attracts
very
young
uneducated
women
yet
i
am
not
much
turned
of
fifty
and
from
the
baroness
singular
behavior
i
had
every
reason
to
expect
handsomer
treatment
than
she
has
been
pleased
to
dispense
to
me
since
my
return
to
this
capital
but
to
proceed
regularly
i
must
beg
your
pardon
for
the
warmth
which
has
hurried
me
to
this
digression
you
know
sir
that
from
the
hour
in
which
i
had
the
honor
of
taking
leave
of
your
noble
family
in
england
i
strove
to
impress
upon
your
rather
volatile
mind
a
just
and
accurate
conception
of
the
people
amongst
whom
i
was
to
conduct
you
when
i
brought
you
into
this
extensive
empire
i
left
no
means
unexerted
to
heighten
your
respect
not
only
for
its
amiable
sovereign
but
for
all
powers
in
amity
with
her
it
is
the
characteristic
of
genius
to
be
zealous
i
was
so
in
favor
of
the
pretensions
of
the
great
catherine
to
that
miserable
country
in
which
you
now
are
and
to
which
she
deigned
to
offer
her
protection
to
this
zeal
and
my
unfortunate
though
honorable
devotion
to
the
wishes
of
the
baroness
i
am
constrained
to
attribute
my
present
dilemma
when
poland
had
the
insolence
to
rebel
against
its
illustrious
mistress
you
remember
that
all
the
rational
world
was
highly
incensed
the
baroness
surowkoff
declared
herself
frequently
and
with
vehemence
she
appealed
to
me
my
veracity
and
my
principles
were
called
forth
and
i
confessed
that
i
thought
every
friend
to
the
tzaritza
ought
to
take
up
arms
against
that
ungrateful
people
the
count
brinicki
was
then
appointed
to
command
the
russian
forces
preparing
to
join
the
formidable
allies
and
her
ladyship
very
unexpectedly
on
my
part
answered
me
by
approving
what
i
said
and
added
that
of
course
i
meant
to
follow
her
cousin
into
poland
for
that
even
she
as
a
woman
was
so
earnest
in
the
cause
she
would
accompany
him
to
the
frontiers
and
there
await
the
result
what
could
i
do
how
could
i
withstand
the
expectations
of
a
lady
of
her
quality
and
one
who
i
believed
loved
me
however
for
some
time
i
did
oppose
my
wish
to
oblige
her
i
urged
my
cloth
and
the
impossibility
of
accounting
for
such
a
line
of
conduct
to
the
father
of
my
pupil
the
baroness
ridiculed
all
these
arguments
as
mere
excuses
and
ended
with
saying
as
you
please
loftus
i
have
been
deceived
in
your
character
the
friend
of
the
baroness
surowkoff
must
be
consistent
he
must
be
as
willing
to
fight
for
the
cause
he
espouses
as
to
speak
for
it
in
this
case
the
sword
must
follow
the
oration
else
we
shall
see
poland
in
the
hands
of
a
rabble
this
decided
me
i
offered
my
services
to
the
count
to
attend
him
to
the
field
he
and
the
young
lords
persuaded
you
to
do
the
same
and
as
i
could
not
think
of
leaving
you
when
your
father
had
placed
you
under
my
charge
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
my
approval
confirmed
your
wish
to
turn
soldier
i
was
not
then
acquainted
somerset
for
you
did
not
tell
me
of
it
until
we
were
far
advanced
into
poland
with
sir
robert
and
my
lady
dislike
of
the
army
this
has
been
a
prime
source
of
my
error
throughout
this
affair
had
i
known
their
repugnance
to
your
taking
up
arms
my
duty
would
have
triumphed
over
even
my
devotion
to
the
baroness
but
i
was
born
under
a
melancholy
horoscope
nothing
happens
as
any
one
of
my
humblest
wishes
might
warrant
at
the
first
onset
of
the
battle
i
became
so
suddenly
ill
that
i
was
obliged
to
retire
and
on
this
unfortunate
event
which
was
completely
unwilled
on
my
part
for
no
man
can
command
the
periods
of
sickness
the
baroness
founded
a
contempt
which
has
disconcerted
all
my
schemes
besides
when
i
attempted
to
remonstrate
with
her
ladyship
on
the
promise
which
if
not
directly
given
was
implied
she
laughed
at
me
and
when
i
persisted
in
my
suit
all
at
once
like
the
rest
of
her
ungrateful
and
undistinguishing
sex
she
burst
into
a
tempest
of
invectives
and
forbade
me
her
presence
what
am
i
now
to
do
somerset
this
inconsistent
woman
has
betrayed
me
into
conduct
diametrically
opposite
to
the
commands
of
your
family
your
father
particularly
desired
that
i
would
not
suffer
you
to
go
either
into
hungary
or
poland
in
the
last
instance
i
have
permitted
you
to
disobey
him
and
my
lady
somerset
who
alas
i
now
remember
lost
both
her
father
and
brother
in
different
engagements
you
tell
me
had
declared
that
she
never
would
pardon
the
man
who
should
put
military
ideas
into
your
head
therefore
sir
though
you
are
my
pupil
i
throw
myself
on
your
generosity
if
you
persist
in
acquainting
your
family
with
the
late
transactions
at
zielime
and
your
present
residence
in
poland
i
shall
finally
be
ruined
i
shall
not
only
forfeit
the
good
opinion
of
your
noble
father
and
mother
but
lose
all
prospect
of
the
living
of
somerset
which
sir
robert
was
so
gracious
as
to
promise
should
be
mine
on
the
demise
of
the
present
incumbent
you
know
somerset
that
i
have
a
mother
and
six
sisters
in
wales
whose
support
depends
on
my
success
in
life
if
my
preferment
be
stopped
now
they
must
necessarily
be
involved
in
a
distress
which
makes
me
shudder
i
can
not
add
more
sir
i
know
well
your
character
for
generosity
and
i
therefore
rest
upon
it
with
the
utmost
confidence
i
shall
detain
the
letter
which
you
did
me
the
honor
to
enclose
for
my
lady
somerset
till
i
receive
your
decision
and
ever
whilst
i
live
will
i
henceforth
remain
firm
to
my
old
and
favorite
maxim
which
i
adopted
from
the
glorious
epistle
of
horace
to
numicius
perhaps
you
may
not
recollect
the
lines
they
run
thus
nil
admirari
prope
res
est
una
numici
solaque
quae
possit
facere
et
servare
beatum
i
have
the
honor
to
be
dear
sir
your
most
obedient
servant
andrew
loftus
petersburg
just
as
i
was
about
sealing
this
packet
the
english
ambassador
forwarded
to
me
a
short
letter
from
your
father
in
which
he
desires
us
to
quit
russia
and
to
make
the
best
of
our
way
to
england
where
you
are
wanted
on
a
most
urgent
occasion
he
explains
himself
no
further
only
repeating
his
orders
in
express
commands
that
we
set
off
instantly
i
wait
your
directions
this
epistle
disconcerted
somerset
he
always
guessed
the
baroness
surowkoff
was
amusing
herself
with
his
vain
and
pedantic
preceptor
but
he
never
entertained
a
suspicion
that
her
ladyship
would
carry
her
pleasantry
to
so
cruel
an
excess
he
clearly
saw
that
the
fears
of
loftus
with
regard
to
the
displeasure
of
his
parents
were
far
from
groundless
and
therefore
as
there
was
no
doubt
from
the
extreme
age
of
dr
manners
that
the
rectory
of
somerset
would
soon
become
vacant
he
thought
it
better
to
oblige
his
poor
governor
and
preserve
their
secret
for
a
month
or
two
than
to
give
him
up
to
the
indignation
of
sir
robert
on
these
grounds
pembroke
resolved
to
write
to
loftus
and
ease
the
anxiety
of
his
heart
although
he
ridiculed
his
vanity
he
could
not
help
respecting
the
affectionate
solicitude
of
a
son
and
a
brother
and
as
that
plea
had
won
him
half
angry
half
grieved
and
half
laughing
he
dispatched
a
few
hasty
lines
to
the
reverend
andrew
loftus
petersburg
what
whimsical
fit
my
dear
sir
has
seized
my
father
that
i
am
recalled
at
a
moment
notice
faith
i
am
so
mad
at
the
summons
and
at
his
not
deigning
to
assign
a
reason
for
his
order
that
i
do
not
know
how
i
may
be
tempted
to
act
another
thing
you
beg
of
me
not
to
say
a
word
of
my
having
been
in
poland
and
for
that
purpose
you
have
withheld
the
letter
which
i
sent
to
you
to
forward
to
my
mother
you
offer
and
precious
excuses
for
having
betrayed
your
own
wisdom
and
your
pupil
innocence
into
so
mortal
an
offence
one
cause
of
my
being
here
you
say
was
your
in
the
cause
of
insulted
russia
and
your
hatred
of
that
levelling
power
which
pervades
all
europe
well
i
grant
it
i
understood
from
you
and
brinicki
that
you
were
leading
me
against
a
set
of
violent
discontented
men
of
rank
who
in
proportion
as
each
was
inflated
with
his
own
personal
pride
despised
all
of
their
own
order
who
did
not
agree
with
them
and
coalescing
together
under
the
name
of
freedom
were
introducing
anarchy
throughout
a
country
which
catharine
would
graciously
have
protected
all
this
i
find
to
be
in
error
but
both
of
you
may
have
been
misled
the
count
by
partiality
and
you
by
misrepresentation
therefore
i
do
not
perceive
why
you
should
be
in
such
a
terror
the
wisest
man
in
the
world
may
see
through
bad
lights
and
why
should
you
think
my
father
would
never
pardon
you
for
having
been
so
unlucky
yet
to
dispel
your
dread
of
such
tidings
ruining
you
with
sir
robert
i
will
not
be
the
first
to
tell
him
of
our
quixoting
only
remember
my
good
sir
though
to
oblige
you
i
withhold
my
letters
to
my
mother
and
when
i
arrive
in
england
shall
lock
up
my
lips
from
mentioning
poland
that
positively
i
will
not
be
mute
one
day
longer
than
that
in
which
my
father
presents
you
with
the
living
of
somerset
then
you
will
be
independent
of
his
displeasure
and
i
may
and
will
declare
my
everlasting
gratitude
to
this
illustrious
family
i
am
half
mad
when
i
think
of
leaving
them
i
must
now
tear
myself
from
this
mansion
of
comfort
and
affection
to
wander
with
you
in
some
rumbling
old
barouche
brake
and
through
briar
well
patience
another
such
upset
to
your
friends
of
the
neva
and
with
perched
like
an
eagle
on
their
laurelled
brows
i
may
have
some
chance
of
wooing
the
sobieskis
to
the
banks
of
the
thames
at
present
i
have
not
sufficient
hope
to
keep
me
in
meet
me
this
day
week
at
dantzic
i
shall
there
embark
for
england
you
had
best
not
bring
the
foreign
servants
with
you
they
might
blab
discharge
them
at
petersburg
and
hire
a
courier
for
yourself
whom
we
may
drop
at
the
seaport
i
have
the
honor
to
remain
dear
sir
your
most
obedient
servant
pembroke
somerset
villanow
when
somerset
joined
his
friends
at
supper
and
imparted
to
them
the
commands
of
his
father
an
immediate
change
was
produced
in
the
spirits
of
the
party
during
the
lamentations
of
the
ladies
and
the
murmurs
of
the
young
men
the
countess
tried
to
dispel
the
effects
of
the
information
by
addressing
pembroke
with
a
smile
and
saying
but
we
hope
that
you
have
seen
enough
at
villanow
to
tempt
you
back
again
at
no
very
distant
period
tell
lady
somerset
you
have
left
a
second
mother
in
poland
who
will
long
to
receive
another
visit
from
her
adopted
son
yes
my
dear
madam
returned
he
and
i
shall
hope
before
a
very
distant
period
to
see
those
two
kind
mothers
united
as
intimately
by
friendship
as
they
are
in
my
heart
thaddeus
listened
with
a
saddened
countenance
he
had
not
been
accustomed
to
the
thought
of
a
long
separation
and
when
he
met
it
now
he
hardly
knew
how
to
proportion
his
uneasiness
to
the
privation
hope
and
all
the
hilarities
of
youth
flushed
in
his
soul
his
features
continually
glowed
with
animation
whilst
the
gay
beaming
of
his
eyes
ever
answered
to
the
smile
on
his
lips
hence
the
slightest
veering
of
his
mind
was
perceptible
to
the
countess
who
turning
round
saw
him
leaning
thoughtfully
in
his
chair
whilst
pembroke
with
increasing
vehemence
was
running
through
various
invectives
against
the
hastiness
of
his
recall
come
come
thaddeus
cried
she
let
us
think
no
more
of
this
parting
until
it
arrives
you
know
that
anticipation
of
evil
is
the
death
of
happiness
and
it
will
be
a
kind
of
suicide
should
we
destroy
the
hours
we
may
yet
enjoy
together
in
vain
complainings
that
they
are
so
soon
to
terminate
a
little
exhortation
from
the
countess
and
a
maternal
kiss
which
she
imprinted
on
his
cheek
restored
him
to
cheerfulness
and
the
evening
passed
more
pleasantly
than
it
had
portended
much
as
the
palatine
esteemed
pembroke
somerset
his
mind
was
too
deeply
absorbed
in
the
condition
of
the
kingdom
to
attend
to
less
considerable
cares
he
beheld
his
country
even
on
the
verge
of
destruction
awaiting
with
firmness
the
approach
of
the
earthquake
which
threatened
to
ingulf
it
in
the
neighboring
nations
he
saw
the
storm
lowering
but
he
determined
whilst
there
remained
one
spot
of
vantage
ground
above
the
general
wreck
that
poland
should
yet
have
a
name
and
a
defender
these
thoughts
possessed
him
these
plans
engaged
him
and
he
had
not
leisure
to
regret
pleasure
when
he
was
struggling
for
existence
the
empress
continued
to
pour
her
armies
into
the
heart
of
the
kingdom
the
king
of
prussia
boldly
flying
from
his
treaties
marched
to
bid
her
colors
a
conqueror
welcome
and
the
emperor
of
germany
following
the
example
of
so
great
a
prince
did
not
blush
to
show
that
his
word
was
equally
contemptible
dispatches
daily
arrived
of
the
villages
being
laid
waste
that
neither
age
sex
nor
situation
shielded
the
unfortunate
inhabitants
and
that
all
the
frontier
provinces
were
in
flames
the
diet
was
called
footnote
the
constitutional
diet
of
poland
nearly
answers
in
principle
to
the
british
three
estates
in
parliament
king
lords
and
commons
and
the
debates
agitated
with
the
anxiety
of
men
who
were
met
to
decide
on
their
dearest
interests
the
bosom
of
the
benevolent
stanislaus
bled
at
the
dreadful
picture
of
his
people
sufferings
and
hardly
able
to
restrain
his
tears
he
answered
the
animated
exordiums
of
sobieski
for
resistance
to
the
last
with
an
appeal
immediately
to
his
heart
what
is
it
that
you
urge
me
to
do
my
lord
said
he
was
it
not
to
secure
the
happiness
of
my
subjects
that
i
labored
and
finding
my
designs
impracticable
what
advantage
would
it
be
to
them
should
i
pertinaciously
oppose
their
small
numbers
to
the
accumulated
array
of
two
empires
and
of
a
king
almost
as
powerful
as
either
what
is
my
kingdom
but
the
comfort
of
my
people
what
will
it
avail
me
to
see
them
fall
around
me
man
by
man
and
the
few
who
remain
bending
in
speechless
sorrow
over
their
graves
such
a
sight
would
break
my
heart
poland
without
its
people
would
be
a
desert
and
i
a
hermit
rather
than
a
king
in
vain
the
palatine
combated
these
arguments
showing
the
vain
quiet
such
a
peace
might
afford
by
declaring
it
could
only
be
temporary
in
vain
he
told
his
majesty
that
he
would
purchase
safety
for
the
present
race
at
the
vast
expense
of
not
only
the
liberty
of
posterity
but
of
its
probity
and
happiness
however
you
disguise
slavery
cried
he
it
is
slavery
still
its
chains
though
wreathed
with
roses
not
only
fasten
on
the
body
but
rivet
on
the
mind
they
bend
it
from
the
loftiest
virtue
to
a
debasement
beneath
calculation
they
disgrace
honor
they
trample
upon
justice
they
transform
the
legions
of
rome
into
a
band
of
singers
they
prostrate
the
sons
of
athens
and
of
sparta
at
the
feet
of
cowards
they
make
man
abjure
his
birth
right
bind
himself
to
another
will
and
give
that
into
a
tyrant
hands
which
he
received
as
a
deposit
from
heaven
his
reason
his
conscience
and
his
soul
think
on
this
and
then
if
you
can
subjugate
poland
to
her
enemies
stanislaus
weakened
by
years
and
subdued
by
disappointment
now
retained
no
higher
wish
than
to
save
his
subjects
from
immediate
outrage
he
did
not
answer
the
palatine
but
with
streaming
eyes
bent
over
the
table
and
annulled
the
glorious
constitution
of
then
with
emotions
hardly
short
of
agony
he
signed
an
order
presented
by
a
plenipotentiary
from
the
combined
powers
which
directed
prince
poniatowski
to
deliver
the
army
under
his
command
into
the
hands
of
general
brinicki
as
the
king
put
his
signature
to
these
papers
sobieski
who
had
strenuously
withstood
each
decision
started
from
his
chair
bowed
to
his
sovereign
and
in
silence
left
the
apartment
several
noblemen
followed
him
these
pacific
measures
did
not
meet
with
better
treatment
from
without
when
they
were
noised
abroad
an
alarming
commotion
arose
among
the
inhabitants
of
warsaw
and
nearly
four
thousand
men
of
the
first
families
in
the
kingdom
assembled
themselves
in
the
park
of
villanow
and
with
tumultuous
eagerness
declared
their
resolution
to
resist
the
invaders
of
their
country
to
their
last
gasp
the
prince
sapieha
kosciusko
and
sobieski
with
the
sage
dombrowski
were
the
first
who
took
this
oath
of
fidelity
to
poland
and
they
administered
it
to
thaddeus
who
kneeling
down
inwardly
invoked
heaven
to
aid
him
as
he
swore
to
fulfil
his
trust
in
the
midst
of
these
momentous
affairs
pembroke
somerset
bade
adieu
to
his
polish
friends
and
set
sail
with
his
governor
from
dantzic
for
england
chapter
vii
the
diet
of
poland
those
winter
months
which
before
this
year
had
been
at
villanow
the
season
for
cheerfulness
and
festivity
now
rolled
away
in
the
sad
pomp
of
national
debates
and
military
assemblies
prussia
usurped
the
best
part
of
pomerelia
and
garrisoned
it
with
troops
catharine
declared
her
dominion
over
the
vast
tract
of
land
which
lies
between
the
dwina
and
borysthenes
and
frederick
william
marked
down
another
sweep
of
poland
to
follow
the
fate
of
dantzic
and
of
thorn
while
watching
the
dark
policy
of
austria
regarding
its
selecting
portions
of
the
dismembering
state
calamities
and
insults
were
heaped
day
after
day
on
the
defenceless
poles
the
deputies
of
the
provinces
were
put
into
prison
and
the
provisions
intended
for
the
king
table
interrupted
and
appropriated
by
the
depredators
to
their
own
use
sobieski
remonstrated
on
this
last
outrage
but
incensed
at
reproof
and
irritated
at
the
sway
which
the
palatine
still
held
an
order
was
issued
for
all
the
sobieski
estates
in
lithuania
and
podolia
to
be
sequestrated
and
divided
between
four
of
the
invading
generals
in
vain
the
villanow
confederation
endeavored
to
remonstrate
with
the
empress
her
ambassador
not
only
refused
to
forward
the
dispatches
but
threatened
the
nobles
if
they
did
not
comply
with
every
one
of
his
demands
he
would
lay
all
the
estates
possessions
and
habitations
of
the
members
of
the
diet
under
an
immediate
military
execution
nay
punishment
should
not
stop
there
for
if
the
king
joined
the
sobieski
party
to
which
he
now
appeared
inclined
the
royal
domains
should
not
only
meet
the
same
fate
but
harsher
treatment
should
follow
until
both
the
people
and
their
proud
sovereign
were
brought
into
due
subjection
these
menaces
were
too
arrogant
to
have
any
other
effect
upon
the
poles
than
that
of
giving
a
new
spur
to
their
resolution
with
the
same
firmness
they
repulsed
similar
fulminations
from
the
prussian
ambassador
and
with
a
coolness
which
was
only
equalled
by
their
intrepidity
they
prepared
to
resume
their
arms
hearing
by
private
information
that
their
threats
were
despised
next
morning
before
daybreak
these
despotic
envoys
surrounded
the
building
where
the
confederation
was
sitting
with
two
battalions
of
grenadiers
and
four
pieces
of
cannon
and
then
issued
orders
that
no
pole
should
pass
the
gates
without
being
fired
on
general
rautenfeld
who
was
set
over
the
person
of
the
king
declared
that
not
even
his
majesty
might
stir
until
the
diet
had
given
an
unanimous
and
full
consent
to
the
imperial
commands
the
diet
set
forth
the
unlawfulness
of
signing
any
treaty
whilst
thus
withheld
from
the
freedom
of
will
and
debate
they
urged
that
it
was
not
legal
to
enter
into
deliberation
when
violence
had
recently
been
exerted
against
any
individual
of
their
body
and
how
could
they
do
it
now
deprived
as
they
were
of
five
of
their
principal
members
whom
the
ambassadors
well
knew
they
had
arrested
on
their
way
to
the
senate
sobieski
and
four
of
his
friends
being
the
members
most
inimical
to
the
oppression
going
on
were
these
five
in
vain
their
liberation
was
required
and
enraged
at
the
pertinacity
of
this
opposition
rautenfeld
repeated
the
former
threats
with
the
addition
of
more
swearing
that
they
should
take
place
without
appeal
if
the
diet
did
not
directly
and
unconditionally
sign
the
pretensions
both
of
his
court
and
that
of
prussia
after
a
hard
contention
of
many
hours
the
members
at
last
agreed
amongst
themselves
to
make
a
solemn
public
protest
against
the
present
tyrannous
measures
of
the
two
ambassadors
and
seeing
that
any
attempt
to
inspire
them
even
with
decency
was
useless
they
determined
to
cease
all
debate
and
kept
a
profound
silence
when
the
marshal
should
propose
the
project
in
demand
this
sorrowful
silence
was
commenced
in
resentment
and
retained
through
despair
this
sorrowful
silence
was
called
by
their
usurpers
a
consent
this
sorrowful
silence
is
held
up
to
the
world
and
to
posterity
as
a
free
cession
by
the
poles
of
all
those
rights
which
they
had
received
from
nature
ratified
by
laws
and
defended
with
their
blood
footnote
thus
like
the
curule
fathers
of
rome
they
sat
unyielding
awaiting
the
threatened
stroke
but
the
dignity
of
virtue
held
her
shield
over
them
and
with
an
answering
silence
on
the
part
of
the
confederated
ambassadors
the
was
vacated
the
morning
after
this
dreadful
day
the
senate
met
at
one
of
the
private
palaces
and
indignant
and
they
delivered
the
following
declaration
to
the
people
the
diet
of
poland
hemmed
in
by
foreign
troops
menaced
with
an
influx
of
the
enemy
which
would
be
attended
by
universal
ruin
and
finally
insulted
by
a
thousand
outrages
have
been
forced
to
witness
the
signing
of
a
submissive
treaty
with
their
enemies
the
diet
had
strenuously
endeavored
to
have
added
to
that
treaty
some
conditions
to
which
they
supposed
the
lamentable
state
of
the
country
would
have
extorted
an
acquiescence
even
from
the
heart
of
a
conqueror
power
but
the
diet
were
deceived
they
found
such
power
was
unaccompanied
by
humanity
they
found
that
the
foe
having
thrown
his
victim
to
the
ground
would
not
refrain
from
exulting
in
the
barbarous
triumph
of
trampling
upon
her
neck
the
diet
rely
on
the
justice
of
poland
rely
on
her
belief
that
they
would
not
betray
the
citadel
she
confided
to
their
keeping
her
preservation
is
dearer
to
them
than
their
lives
but
fate
seems
to
be
on
the
side
of
their
destroyer
fresh
insults
have
been
heaped
upon
their
heads
and
new
hardships
have
been
imposed
upon
them
to
prevent
all
deliberations
on
this
debasing
treaty
they
are
not
only
surrounded
by
foreign
troops
and
dared
with
hostile
messages
but
they
have
been
violated
by
the
arrest
of
their
prime
members
whilst
those
who
are
still
suffered
to
possess
a
personal
freedom
have
the
most
galling
shackles
laid
upon
their
minds
therefore
i
the
king
of
poland
enervated
by
age
and
sinking
under
the
accumulated
weight
of
my
kingdom
afflictions
and
also
we
the
members
of
the
diet
declare
that
being
unable
even
by
the
sacrifice
of
our
lives
to
relieve
our
country
from
the
yoke
of
its
oppressors
we
consign
it
to
our
children
and
the
justice
of
heaven
in
another
age
means
may
be
found
to
rescue
it
from
chains
and
misery
but
such
means
are
not
put
in
our
power
other
countries
neglect
us
whilst
they
reprobate
the
violations
which
a
neighboring
nation
is
alleged
to
have
committed
against
rational
liberty
they
behold
not
only
with
apathy
but
with
approbation
the
ravages
which
are
now
desolating
poland
posterity
must
avenge
it
we
have
done
we
accede
in
silence
for
the
reasons
above
mentioned
to
the
treaty
laid
before
us
though
we
declare
that
it
is
contrary
to
our
wishes
to
our
sentiments
and
to
our
rights
thus
in
november
compressed
to
one
fourth
of
her
dimensions
by
the
lines
of
demarcation
drawn
by
her
invaders
poland
was
stripped
of
her
rank
in
europe
her
power
delivered
up
to
strangers
and
her
beauty
into
the
hands
of
her
enemies
people
nations
will
weep
over
your
wrongs
whilst
the
burning
blush
of
shame
that
their
fathers
witnessed
such
wrongs
unmoved
shall
cause
the
tears
to
blister
as
they
fall
during
these
transactions
the
countess
sobieski
continued
in
solitude
at
villanow
awaiting
with
awful
anxiety
the
termination
of
those
portentous
events
which
so
deeply
involved
her
own
comforts
with
those
of
her
country
her
father
was
in
prison
her
son
at
a
distance
with
the
army
sick
at
heart
she
saw
the
opening
of
that
spring
which
might
be
the
commencement
only
of
a
new
season
of
injuries
and
her
fears
were
prophetic
it
being
discovered
that
some
masovian
regiments
in
the
neighborhood
of
warsaw
yet
retained
their
arms
they
were
ordered
by
the
foreign
envoys
to
lay
them
down
a
few
thinking
denial
vain
obeyed
but
bolder
spirits
followed
thaddeus
sobieski
towards
south
prussia
whither
he
had
directed
his
steps
on
the
arrest
of
his
grandfather
and
where
he
had
gathered
and
kept
together
a
handful
of
brave
men
still
faithful
to
their
liberties
his
name
alone
collected
numbers
in
every
district
through
which
he
marched
persecution
from
their
adversary
as
well
as
admiration
of
thaddeus
had
given
a
resistless
power
to
his
appearance
look
and
voice
all
of
which
had
such
an
effect
on
the
peasantry
that
they
eagerly
crowded
to
his
standard
whilst
their
young
lords
committed
themselves
without
reserve
to
his
sole
judgment
and
command
the
prussian
ambassador
hearing
of
this
sent
to
stanislaus
to
command
the
grandson
of
sobieski
to
disband
his
troops
the
king
refusing
and
his
answer
being
communicated
to
the
russian
envoy
also
war
was
renewed
with
redoubled
fury
the
palatine
remained
in
confinement
hopeless
of
obtaining
release
without
the
aid
of
stratagem
his
country
enemies
were
too
well
aware
of
their
interest
to
give
freedom
to
so
active
an
opponent
they
sought
to
vex
his
spirit
with
every
mental
torture
but
he
rather
received
consolation
than
despair
in
the
reports
daily
brought
to
him
by
his
jailers
they
told
him
that
his
grandson
continued
to
carry
himself
with
such
insolent
opposition
in
the
south
it
would
be
well
if
the
empress
at
the
termination
of
the
war
allowed
him
to
escape
with
banishment
to
siberia
but
every
reproach
thus
levelled
at
the
palatine
he
found
had
been
bought
by
some
new
success
of
thaddeus
and
instead
of
permitting
their
malignity
to
intimidate
his
age
or
alarm
his
affection
he
told
the
officer
who
kept
guard
in
his
chambers
that
if
his
grandson
were
to
lose
his
head
for
fidelity
to
poland
he
should
behold
him
with
as
proud
an
eye
mounting
the
scaffold
as
entering
the
streets
of
warsaw
with
her
freedom
in
his
hand
the
only
difference
would
be
continued
sobieski
that
as
the
first
can
not
happen
until
all
virtue
be
dead
in
this
land
i
should
regard
his
last
gasp
as
the
expiring
sigh
of
that
virtue
which
by
him
had
found
a
triumph
even
under
the
axe
but
for
the
second
it
would
be
joy
unutterable
to
behold
the
victory
of
justice
over
rapine
and
violence
but
either
way
thaddeus
sobieski
is
still
the
same
ready
to
die
or
ready
to
live
for
his
country
and
equally
worthy
of
the
sacred
halo
with
which
posterity
would
encircle
his
name
forever
indeed
the
accounts
which
arrived
from
this
young
soldier
who
had
formed
a
junction
with
general
kosciusko
were
in
the
highest
degree
formidable
to
the
coalesced
powers
having
gained
several
advantages
over
the
prussians
the
two
victorious
battalions
were
advancing
towards
inowlotz
when
a
large
and
fresh
body
of
the
enemy
appeared
suddenly
on
their
rear
the
enemy
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
whom
the
poles
were
driving
before
them
at
sight
of
this
reinforcement
rallied
and
not
only
to
retard
the
approach
of
the
pursuers
but
to
ensure
their
defeat
from
the
army
in
view
they
broke
down
the
wooden
bridge
by
which
they
had
escaped
themselves
the
poles
were
at
a
stand
kosciusko
proposed
swimming
across
but
owing
to
the
recent
heavy
rains
the
river
was
so
swollen
and
rapid
that
the
young
captains
to
whom
he
mentioned
the
project
terrified
by
the
blackness
and
dashing
of
the
water
drew
back
the
general
perceiving
their
panic
called
thaddeus
to
him
and
both
plunged
into
the
stream
ashamed
of
hesitation
the
others
now
tried
who
could
first
follow
their
example
and
after
hard
buffeting
with
its
tide
the
whole
army
gained
the
opposite
shore
the
prussians
who
were
in
the
rear
incapable
of
the
like
intrepidity
halted
and
those
who
had
crossed
on
their
former
defeat
now
again
intimidated
at
the
daring
courage
of
their
adversaries
concealed
themselves
amidst
the
thickets
of
an
adjoining
valley
the
two
friends
proceeded
towards
cracow
footnote
cracow
is

about
miles
of

the

the
centre
of
its
own

carrying
redress

they
marched

they
had
hardly
rested
a
day
in
that
city
before
dispatches
were
received
that
warsaw
was
lying
at
the
mercy
of
general
brinicki
no
time
could
be
lost
officers
and
men
had
set
their
lives
on
the
cause
and
they
recommenced
their
toil
of
a
new
march
with
a
perseverance
which
brought
them
before
the
capital
on
the
of
april
things
were
in
a
worse
state
than
even
was
expected
the
three
ambassadors
had
not
only
demanded
the
surrender
of
the
national
arsenal
but
subscribed
their
orders
with
a
threat
that
whoever
of
the
nobles
presumed
to
dispute
their
authority
should
be
arrested
and
closely
imprisoned
there
and
if
the
people
should
dare
to
murmur
they
would
immediately
order
general
brinicki
to
lay
the
city
in
ashes
the
king
remonstrated
against
such
oppression
and
to
punish
his
presumption
his
excellency
ordered
that
his
majesty
garrison
and
guards
should
instantly
be
broken
up
and
dispersed
at
the
first
attempt
to
execute
this
mandate
the
people
flew
in
crowds
to
the
palace
and
falling
on
their
knees
implored
stanislaus
for
permission
to
avenge
the
insult
offered
to
his
troops
the
king
looked
at
them
with
pity
gratitude
and
anguish
for
some
time
his
emotions
were
too
strong
to
allow
him
to
speak
at
last
in
a
voice
of
agony
wrung
from
his
tortured
heart
he
answered

into

dreadful
conflict

was
rescued
from

grasp
of
the
hovering
black
eagle
during
the
fight
the
king
who
was
alone
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
his
palace
sank
in
despair
on
the
floor
he
heard
the
mingling
clash
of
arms
the
roar
of
musketry
and
the
cries
and
groans
of
the
combatants
ruin
seemed
no
longer
to
threaten
his
kingdom
but
to
have
pounced
at
once
upon
her
prey
at
every
renewed
volley
which
followed
each
pause
in
the
firing
he
expected
to
see
his
palace
gates
burst
open
and
himself
then
indeed
made
a
willing
sacrifice
immolated
to
the
vengeance
of
his
enemies

was

upon

battle
of
brzesc
the
tenth
of
october
thaddeus
was
not
less
eager
to
release
his
grandfather
than
he
had
been
to
relieve
the
anxiety
of
his
sovereign
he
hastened
at
the
head
of
a
few
troops
to
the
prison
of
sobieski
and
gave
him
liberty
amidst
the
acclamations
of
his
soldiers
the
universal
joy
at
these
prosperous
events
did
not
last
many
days
it
was
speedily
terminated
by
information
that
cracow
had
surrendered
to
a
prussian
force
that
the
king
of
prussia
was
advancing
towards
the
capital
and
that
the
russians
more
implacable
in
consequence
of
the
late
treatment
their
garrison
had
received
at
warsaw
were
pouring
into
the
country
like
a
deluge
at
this
intelligence
the
consternation
became
dreadful
the
polonese
army
in
general
worn
with
fatigue
and
long
service
and
without
clothing
or
ammunition
were
not
in
any
way
excepting
courage
fitted
for
resuming
the
field
the
treasury
was
exhausted
and
means
of
raising
a
supply
seemed
impracticable
the
provinces
were
laid
waste
and
the
city
had
already
been
drained
of
its
last
ducat
in
this
exigency
a
council
met
in
his
majesty
cabinet
to
devise
some
expedient
for
obtaining
resources
the
consultation
was
as
desponding
as
their
situation
until
thaddeus
sobieski
who
had
been
a
silent
observer
rose
from
his
seat
sudden
indisposition
had
prevented
the
palatine
attending
but
his
grandson
knew
well
how
to
be
his
substitute
whilst
blushes
of
awe
and
eagerness
crimsoned
his
cheek
he
advanced
towards
stanislaus
and
taking
from
his
neck
and
other
parts
of
his
dress
those
magnificent
jewels
it
was
customary
to
wear
in
the
presence
of
the
king
he
knelt
down
and
laying
them
at
the
feet
of
his
majesty
said
in
a
suppressed
voice
these
are
trifles
but
such
as
they
are
and
all
of
the
like
kind
which
we
possess
i
am
commanded
by
my
grandfather
to
beseech
your
majesty
to
appropriate
to
the
public
service
noble
young
man
cried
the
king
raising
him
from
the
ground
you
have
indeed
taught
me
a
lesson
i
accept
these
jewels
with
gratitude
here
said
he
turning
to
the
treasurer
put
them
into
the
national
fund
and
let
them
be
followed
by
my
own
with
my
gold
and
silver
plate
which
latter
i
desire
may
be
instantly
sent
to
the
mint
three
parts
the
army
shall
have
the
other
we
must
expend
in
giving
support
to
the
surviving
families
of
the
brave
men
who
have
fallen
in
our
defence
the
palatine
readily
united
with
his
grandson
in
the
surrender
of
all
their
personal
property
for
the
benefit
of
their
country
and
according
to
their
example
the
treasury
was
soon
filled
with
gratuities
from
the
nobles
the
very
artisans
offered
their
services
gratis
and
all
hands
being
employed
to
forward
the
preparations
the
army
was
soon
enabled
to
take
the
field
newly
equipped
and
in
high
spirits
the
countess
had
again
to
bid
adieu
to
a
son
who
was
now
become
as
much
the
object
of
her
admiration
as
of
her
love
in
proportion
as
glory
surrounded
him
and
danger
courted
his
steps
the
strings
of
affection
drew
him
closer
to
her
soul
the
aspiring
blood
of
the
sobieskis
which
beat
in
her
veins
could
not
cheer
the
dread
of
a
mother
could
not
cause
her
to
forget
that
the
spring
of
her
existence
now
flowed
from
the
fountain
which
had
taken
its
source
from
her
her
anxious
and
watching
heart
paid
dearly
in
tears
and
sleepless
nights
for
the
honor
with
which
she
was
saluted
at
every
turning
as
the
mother
of
thaddeus
that
thaddeus
who
was
not
more
the
spirit
of
enterprise
and
the
rallying
point
of
resistance
than
he
was
to
her
the
gentlest
the
dearest
the
most
amiable
of
sons
it
matters
not
to
the
undistinguishing
bolt
of
carnage
whether
it
strike
common
breasts
or
those
rare
hearts
whose
lives
are
usually
as
brief
as
they
are
dazzling
this
leaden
messenger
of
death
banquets
as
greedily
on
the
bosom
of
a
hero
as
if
it
had
lit
upon
more
vulgar
prey
all
is
levelled
to
the
seeming
chance
of
war
which
comes
like
a
whirlwind
of
the
desert
scattering
man
and
beast
in
one
wide
ruin
such
thoughts
as
these
possessed
the
melancholy
but
prayerful
reveries
of
the
countess
sobieski
from
the
hour
in
which
she
saw
thaddeus
and
his
grandfather
depart
for
cracow
until
she
heard
it
was
retaken
and
that
the
enemy
were
defeated
in
several
subsequent
contests
warsaw
was
again
bombarded
and
again
kosciusko
with
the
palatine
and
thaddeus
preserved
it
from
destruction
in
short
wherever
they
moved
their
dauntless
little
army
carried
terror
to
its
adversaries
and
diffused
hope
through
the
homes
and
hearts
of
their
countrymen
they
next
turned
their
course
to
the
relief
of
lithuania
but
whilst
they
were
on
their
route
thither
they
received
intelligence
that
a
division
of
the
poles
led
by
prince
poniatowski
having
been
routed
by
a
formidable
body
of
russians
under
suwarrow
that
general
elated
with
his
success
was
hastening
forward
to
the
capital
kosciusko
resolved
to
prevent
him
prepared
to
give
immediate
battle
to
ferfen
another
russian
commander
who
was
on
his
march
to
form
a
junction
with
his
victorious
countrymen
to
this
end
kosciusko
divided
his
forces
half
of
them
to
not
only
support
the
retreat
of
the
prince
but
to
enable
him
to
hover
near
suwarrow
and
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
over
his
motions
whilst
kosciusko
accompanied
by
the
two
sobieskis
would
proceed
with
the
other
division
towards
brzesc
it
was
the
tenth
of
october
the
weather
being
fine
a
cloudless
sun
diffused
life
and
brilliancy
through
the
pure
air
of
a
keen
morning
the
vast
green
plain
before
them
glittered
with
the
troops
of
general
ferfen
who
had
already
arranged
them
in
order
of
battle
the
word
was
given
thaddeus
as
he
drew
his
sabre
footnote
the
sabre
like
the
once
famed
claymore
of
scotland
was
the
characteristic
weapon
of
poland
it
was
the
especial
appendage
to
the
sides
of
the
nobles
its
use
the
science
of
their
youth
their
ornament
and
graceful
exercise
in
peace
their
most
efficient
manual
power
of
attack
or
defence
in
war
it
is
impossible
for
any
but
an
to
have
any
idea
of
the
skill
beauty
and
determination
with
which
this
weapon
was
and
is
wielded
in
poland
from
its
scabbard
raised
his
eyes
to
implore
the
justice
of
heaven
on
that
day
events
the
attack
was
made
the
poles
kept
their
station
on
the
heights
the
russians
rushed
on
them
like
wolves
and
twice
they
repulsed
them
by
their
steadiness
conquest
declared
for
poland
thaddeus
was
seen
in
every
part
of
the
field
but
reinforcements
poured
in
to
the
support
of
ferfen
and
war
raged
in
new
horrors
still
the
courage
of
the
poles
was
unabated
sobieski
fighting
at
the
head
of
his
cavalry
would
not
recede
a
foot
and
kosciusko
exhorting
his
men
to
be
resolute
appeared
in
the
hottest
places
of
the
battle
at
one
of
these
portentous
moments
the
was
seen
struggling
with
the
third
charger
which
had
been
shot
under
him
that
day
thaddeus
galloped
to
his
assistance
gave
him
his
horse
mounted
another
offered
by
a
hussar
and
remained
fighting
by
his
side
till
on
the
next
charge
kosciusko
himself
fell
forward
thaddeus
caught
him
in
his
arms
and
finding
that
his
own
breast
was
immediately
covered
with
blood
a
cossack
having
stabbed
the
general
through
the
shoulder
he
unconsciously
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
the
surrounding
soldiers
took
the
alarm
and
kosciusko
our
father
is
killed
was
echoed
from
rank
to
rank
with
such
piercing
shrieks
that
the
wounded
hero
started
from
the
breast
of
his
young
friend
just
as
two
russian
chasseurs
in
the
same
moment
made
a
cut
at
them
both
the
sabre
struck
the
exposed
head
of
kosciusko
who
sunk
senseless
to
the
ground
and
thaddeus
received
a
gash
near
his
neck
that
laid
him
by
his
side
the
consternation
became
universal
groans
of
despair
seemed
to
issue
from
the
whole
army
whilst
the
few
resolute
poles
who
had
been
stationed
near
the
fallen
general
fell
in
mangled
heaps
upon
his
breast
thaddeus
with
difficulty
extricated
himself
from
the
bodies
of
the
slain
and
fighting
his
way
through
the
triumphant
troops
which
pressed
around
him
amidst
the
smoke
and
confusion
soon
joined
his
comrades
who
in
the
wildest
despair
were
dispersing
under
a
heavy
fire
and
flying
like
frighted
deer
in
vain
he
called
to
them
in
vain
he
urged
them
to
avenge
kosciusko
the
panic
was
complete
and
they
fled
almost
alone
in
the
rear
of
his
soldiers
he
opposed
with
his
single
and
desperate
arm
party
after
party
of
the
enemy
until
a
narrow
stream
of
the
muchavez
stopped
his
retreat
the
waters
were
crimsoned
with
blood
he
plunged
in
and
beating
the
blushing
wave
with
his
left
arm
in
a
few
seconds
gained
the
opposite
bank
where
fainting
from
fatigue
and
loss
of
blood
he
sunk
almost
deprived
of
sense
amidst
a
heap
of
the
killed
when
the
pursuing
squadrons
had
galloped
past
him
he
again
summoned
strength
to
look
round
he
raised
himself
from
the
ground
and
by
the
help
of
his
sabre
supported
his
steps
a
few
paces
further
but
what
was
the
shock
he
received
when
the
bleeding
and
lifeless
body
of
his
grandfather
lay
before
him
he
stood
for
a
few
moments
motionless
and
without
sensation
then
kneeling
down
by
his
side
whilst
he
felt
as
if
his
own
heart
were
palsied
with
death
he
searched
for
the
wounds
of
the
palatine
they
were
numerous
and
deep
he
would
have
torn
away
the
handkerchief
with
which
he
had
stanched
his
own
blood
to
have
applied
it
to
that
of
his
grandfather
but
in
the
instant
he
was
so
doing
feeling
the
act
might
the
next
moment
disable
himself
from
giving
him
further
assistance
he
took
his
sash
and
and
when
they
were
insufficient
he
rent
the
linen
from
his
breast
then
hastening
to
the
river
he
brought
a
little
water
in
his
cap
and
threw
some
of
its
stained
drops
on
the
pale
features
of
sobieski
the
venerable
hero
opened
his
eyes
in
a
minute
afterwards
he
recognized
that
it
was
his
grandson
who
knelt
by
him
the
palatine
pressed
his
hand
which
was
cold
as
ice
the
marble
lips
of
thaddeus
could
not
move
my
son
said
the
veteran
in
a
low
voice
heaven
hath
led
you
hither
to
receive
the
last
sigh
of
your
grandfather
thaddeus
trembled
the
palatine
continued
carry
my
blessing
to
your
mother
and
bid
her
seek
comfort
in
the
consolations
of
her
god
may
that
god
preserve
you
ever
remember
that
you
are
his
servant
be
obedient
to
him
and
as
i
have
been
be
faithful
to
your
country
may
god
so
bless
me
cried
thaddeus
looking
up
to
heaven
and
ever
remember
said
the
palatine
raising
his
head
which
had
dropped
on
the
bosom
of
his
grandson
that
you
are
a
sobieski
it
is
my
dying
command
that
you
never
take
any
other
name
i
promise
thaddeus
could
say
no
more
for
the
countenance
of
his
grandfather
became
altered
his
eyes
closed
thaddeus
caught
him
to
his
breast
no
heart
beat
against
his
all
was
still
and
cold
the
body
dropped
from
his
arms
and
he
sunk
senseless
by
its
side
when
consciousness
returned
to
him
he
looked
up
the
sky
was
shrouded
in
clouds
which
a
driving
wind
was
blowing
from
the
orb
of
the
moon
while
a
few
of
her
white
rays
gleamed
sepulchrally
on
the
weapons
of
the
slaughtered
soldiers
the
scattered
senses
of
thaddeus
gradually
returned
to
him
he
was
now
lying
the
only
living
creature
amidst
thousands
of
the
dead
who
the
preceding
night
had
been
like
himself
alive
to
all
the
consciousness
of
existence
his
right
hand
rested
on
the
pale
face
of
his
grandfather
it
was
wet
with
dew
he
shuddered
taking
his
own
cloak
from
his
shoulders
he
laid
it
over
the
body
he
would
have
said
as
he
did
it
so
my
father
i
would
have
sheltered
thy
life
with
my
own
but
the
words
choked
in
his
throat
and
he
sat
watching
by
the
corpse
until
the
day
dawned
and
the
poles
returned
to
bury
their
slain
the
wretched
thaddeus
was
discovered
by
a
party
of
his
own
hussars
seated
on
a
little
mound
of
earth
with
the
cold
hand
of
sobieski
grasped
in
his
at
this
sight
the
soldiers
uttered
a
cry
of
dismay
and
sorrow
thaddeus
rose
up
my
friends
said
he
i
thank
god
that
you
are
come
assist
me
to
bear
my
dear
grandfather
to
the
camp
astonished
at
this
composure
but
distressed
at
the
dreadful
hue
of
his
countenance
they
obeyed
him
in
mournful
silence
and
laid
the
remains
of
the
palatine
upon
a
bier
which
they
formed
with
their
sheathed
sabres
then
gently
raising
it
they
retrod
their
steps
to
the
camp
leaving
a
detachment
to
accomplish
the
duty
for
which
they
had
quitted
it
thaddeus
hardly
able
to
support
his
weakened
frame
mounted
a
horse
and
followed
the
melancholy
procession
general
wawrzecki
on
whom
the
command
had
devolved
seeing
the
party
returning
so
soon
and
in
such
an
order
sent
an
to
inquire
the
reason
he
came
back
with
dejection
in
his
face
and
informed
his
commander
that
the
brave
palatine
of
masovia
whom
they
supposed
had
been
taken
prisoner
with
his
grandson
and
kosciusko
was
the
occasion
of
this
sudden
return
that
he
had
been
killed
and
his
body
was
now
approaching
the
lines
on
the
arms
of
the
soldiers
wawrzecki
though
glad
to
hear
that
thaddeus
was
alive
and
at
liberty
turned
to
conceal
his
tears
then
calling
out
a
guard
he
marched
at
their
head
to
meet
the
corpse
of
his
illustrious
friend
the
bier
was
carried
into
the
general
tent
an
and
some
gentlemen
of
the
faculty
were
ordered
to
attend
thaddeus
to
his
quarters
but
the
young
count
though
scarcely
able
to
stand
appeared
to
linger
and
holding
fast
by
the
arm
of
an
officer
he
looked
steadfastly
on
the
body
wawrzecki
understood
his
hesitation
he
pressed
his
hand
fear
not
my
dear
sir
said
he
every
honor
shall
be
paid
to
the
remains
of
your
noble
grandfather
thaddeus
bowed
his
head
and
was
supported
out
of
the
tent
to
his
own
his
wounds
of
which
he
had
received
several
were
not
deep
and
might
have
been
of
little
consequence
had
not
his
thoughts
continually
hovered
about
his
mother
and
painted
her
affliction
when
she
should
be
informed
of
the
lamentable
events
of
the
last
battle
these
reflections
awake
or
in
a
slumber
for
he
never
slept
possessed
his
mind
and
even
whilst
his
wounds
were
healing
produced
such
an
irritation
in
his
blood
as
hourly
threatened
a
fever
things
were
in
this
situation
when
the
surgeon
put
a
letter
from
the
countess
into
his
hand
he
opened
it
and
read
with
breathless
anxiety
these
lines
to
thaddeus
count
sobieski
console
yourself
my
most
precious
son
console
yourself
for
my
sake
i
have
seen
colonel
lonza
and
i
have
heard
all
the
horrors
which
took
place
on
the
tenth
of
this
month
i
have
heard
them
and
i
am
yet
alive
i
am
resigned
he
tells
me
you
are
wounded
oh
do
not
let
me
be
bereft
of
my
son
also
remember
that
you
were
my
dear
sainted
father
darling
remember
that
as
his
representative
you
are
to
be
my
consolation
in
pity
to
me
if
not
to
our
suffering
country
preserve
yourself
to
be
at
least
the
last
comfort
mercy
hath
spared
to
me
i
find
that
all
is
lost
to
poland
as
well
as
to
myself
that
when
my
glorious
father
fell
and
his
friend
with
him
even
its
name
as
a
country
became
extinct
the
allied
invaders
are
in
full
march
towards
masovia
and
i
am
too
weak
to
come
to
you
let
me
see
you
soon
very
soon
my
beloved
son
i
beseech
you
to
come
to
me
you
will
find
me
feebler
in
body
than
in
mind
for
there
is
a
holy
comforter
that
descends
on
the
bruised
heart
which
none
other
than
the
unhappy
have
conceived
or
felt
farewell
my
dear
dear
thaddeus
let
the
memory
that
you
have
a
mother
check
your
too
ardent
courage
god
forever
guard
you
live
for
your
mother
who
has
no
stronger
words
to
express
her
affection
for
you
than
she
is
thy
mother
thy
therese
sobieski
villanow
this
letter
was
indeed
a
balm
to
the
soul
of
thaddeus
that
his
mother
had
received
intelligence
of
the
cruel
event
with
such
holy
resignation
was
the
best
medicine
that
could
now
be
applied
to
his
wounds
both
of
mind
and
body
and
when
he
was
told
that
on
the
succeeding
morning
the
body
of
his
grandfather
would
be
removed
to
the
convent
near
biala
he
declared
his
resolution
to
attend
it
to
the
grave
in
vain
his
surgeons
and
general
wawrzecki
remonstrated
against
the
danger
of
this
project
for
once
the
gentle
and
yielding
spirit
of
thaddeus
was
inflexible
he
had
fixed
his
determination
and
it
was
not
to
be
shaken
next
day
being
the
seventh
from
that
in
which
the
fatal
battle
had
been
decided
thaddeus
at
the
first
beat
of
the
drum
rose
from
his
pallet
and
almost
unassisted
put
on
his
clothes
his
uniform
being
black
he
needed
no
other
index
than
his
pale
and
mournful
countenance
to
announce
that
he
was
chief
mourner
the
procession
began
to
form
and
he
walked
from
his
tent
it
was
a
fine
morning
thaddeus
looked
up
as
if
to
upbraid
the
sun
for
shining
so
brightly
lengthened
and
repeated
rounds
of
cannon
rolled
along
the
air
the
solemn
march
of
the
dead
was
moaning
from
the
muffled
drum
interrupted
at
measured
pauses
by
the
shrill
tremor
of
the
fife
the
troops
preceded
by
their
general
moved
forward
with
a
decent
and
melancholy
step
the
bishop
of
warsaw
followed
bearing
the
sacred
volume
in
his
hands
and
next
borne
upon
the
crossed
pikes
of
his
soldiers
and
supported
by
twelve
of
his
veteran
companions
appeared
the
body
of
the
brave
sobieski
a
velvet
pall
covered
it
on
which
were
laid
those
arms
with
which
for
fifty
years
he
had
asserted
the
loyal
independence
of
his
country
at
this
sight
the
sobs
of
the
men
became
audible
thaddeus
followed
with
a
slow
but
firm
step
his
eyes
bent
to
the
ground
and
his
arms
wrapped
in
his
cloak
it
was
the
same
which
had
shaded
his
beloved
grandfather
from
the
dews
of
that
dreadful
night
another
train
of
solemn
music
succeeded
and
then
the
squadrons
which
the
deceased
had
commanded
dismounted
and
leading
their
horses
closed
the
procession
on
the
verge
of
the
plain
that
borders
biala
and
within
a
few
paces
of
the
convent
gate
of
francis
the
bier
stopped
the
monks
saluted
its
appearance
with
a
requiem
which
they
continued
to
chant
till
the
coffin
was
lowered
into
the
ground
the
earth
received
its
sacred
deposit
the
anthems
ceased
the
soldiers
kneeling
down
discharged
their
muskets
over
it
then
with
streaming
cheeks
rose
and
gave
place
to
others
nine
volleys
were
fired
and
the
ranks
fell
back
the
bishop
advanced
to
the
head
of
the
grave
all
was
hushed
he
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
then
after
a
pause
in
which
he
seemed
to
be
communing
with
the
regions
above
him
he
turned
to
the
silent
assembly
and
in
a
voice
collected
and
impressive
addressed
them
in
a
short
but
affecting
oration
in
which
he
set
forth
the
brightness
of
sobieski
life
his
noble
forgetfulness
of
self
in
the
interests
of
his
country
and
the
dauntless
bravery
which
laid
him
in
the
dust
a
general
discharge
of
cannon
was
the
awful
response
to
this
appeal
wawrzecki
took
the
sabre
of
the
palatine
and
breaking
it
dropped
it
into
the
grave
the
of
the
deceased
did
the
same
with
theirs
showing
that
by
so
doing
they
resigned
their
offices
and
then
covering
their
faces
with
their
handkerchiefs
they
turned
away
with
the
soldiers
who
filed
off
thaddeus
sunk
on
his
knees
his
hands
were
clasped
and
his
eyes
for
a
few
minutes
fixed
themselves
on
the
coffin
of
his
grandfather
then
rising
he
leaned
on
the
arm
of
wawrzecki
and
with
a
tottering
step
and
pallid
countenance
mounted
his
horse
which
had
been
led
to
the
spot
and
returned
with
the
scattered
procession
to
the
camp
the
cause
for
exertion
being
over
his
spirits
fell
with
the
rapidity
of
a
spring
too
highly
wound
up
which
snaps
and
runs
down
to
immobility
he
entered
his
tent
and
threw
himself
on
the
bed
from
which
he
did
not
raise
for
the
five
following
days
chapter
ix
the
last
days
of
villanow
at
a
time
when
the
effects
of
these
sufferings
and
fatigues
had
brought
his
bodily
strength
to
its
lowest
ebb
the
young
count
sobieski
was
roused
by
information
that
the
russians
had
planted
themselves
before
praga
and
were
preparing
to
bombard
the
town
the
intelligence
nerved
his
heart
sinews
again
and
rallied
the
spirits
also
of
his
depressed
soldiers
who
energetically
obeyed
their
commander
to
put
themselves
in
readiness
to
march
at
set
of
sun
thaddeus
saw
that
the
decisive
hour
was
pending
and
as
the
moon
rose
though
hardly
able
to
sit
his
noble
charger
he
refused
the
indulgence
of
a
litter
determining
that
no
illness
while
he
had
any
power
to
master
its
disabilities
should
make
him
recede
from
his
duty
the
image
of
his
mother
too
so
near
the
threatened
spot
rushed
on
his
soul
in
quick
march
he
led
on
his
troops
devastation
met
them
over
the
face
of
the
country
scared
and
houseless
villagers
were
flying
in
every
direction
old
men
stood
amongst
the
ashes
of
their
homes
wailing
to
the
pitying
heavens
since
man
had
none
children
and
woman
sat
by
the
waysides
weeping
over
the
last
sustenance
the
wretched
infants
drew
from
the
breasts
of
their
perishing
mothers
thaddeus
shut
his
eyes
on
the
scene
oh
my
country
my
country
exclaimed
he
what
are
my
personal
griefs
to
thine
it
is
your
afflictions
that
barb
me
to
the
heart
look
there
cried
he
to
the
soldiers
pointing
to
the
miserable
spectacles
before
him
look
there
and
carry
vengeance
into
the
breasts
of
their
destroyers
let
praga
be
the
last
act
of
this
tragedy
unhappy
young
man
unfortunate
country
it
was
indeed
the
last
act
of
a
tragedy
to
which
all
europe
were
spectators
a
tragedy
which
the
nations
witnessed
without
one
attempt
to
stop
or
to
delay
its
dreadful
catastrophe
oh
how
must
virtue
be
lost
when
it
is
no
longer
a
matter
of
policy
even
to
assume
it
footnote
to
answer
this
we
must
remember
that
europe
was
then
no
longer
what
she
was
a
century
before
almost
all
her
nations
had
turned
from
the
doctrines
of
sound
things
and
more
or
less
drank
deeply
of
the
cup
of
infidelity
drugged
for
them
by
the
flattering
sophistries
of
voltaire
the
draught
was
inebriation
and
the
wild
consequences
burst
asunder
the
responsibilities
of
man
to
man
the
selfish
principle
ruled
and
balance
of
justice
was
then
seen
only
aloft
in
the
heavens
after
a
long
march
through
a
dark
and
dismal
night
the
morning
began
to
break
and
thaddeus
found
himself
on
the
southern
side
of
that
little
river
which
divides
the
territories
of
sobieski
from
the
woods
of
kobylka
here
for
the
first
time
he
endured
all
the
torturing
varieties
of
despair
the
once
fertile
fields
were
burnt
to
stubble
the
cottages
were
yet
smoking
from
the
ravages
of
the
fire
and
in
place
of
smiling
eyes
and
thankful
lips
coming
to
meet
him
he
beheld
the
dead
bodies
of
his
peasants
stretched
on
the
high
roads
mangled
bleeding
and
stripped
of
that
decent
covering
which
humanity
would
not
deny
to
the
vilest
criminal
thaddeus
could
bear
the
sight
no
longer
but
setting
spurs
to
his
horse
fled
from
the
contemplation
of
scenes
which
harrowed
up
his
soul
at
nightfall
the
army
halted
under
the
walls
of
villanow
the
count
looked
towards
the
windows
of
the
palace
and
by
a
light
shining
through
the
curtains
distinguished
his
mother
room
he
then
turned
his
eye
on
that
sweep
of
building
which
contained
the
palatine
apartments
but
not
one
solitary
lamp
illumined
its
gloom
the
moon
alone
glimmered
on
the
battlements
silvering
the
painted
glass
of
the
study
window
where
with
that
beloved
parent
he
had
so
lately
gazed
upon
the
stars
and
anticipated
with
the
most
sanguine
hopes
the
result
of
the
campaign
which
had
now
terminated
so
disastrously
for
his
unhappy
country
but
these
thoughts
with
his
grief
and
his
forebodings
were
buried
in
the
depths
of
his
determined
heart
addressing
general
wawrzecki
he
bade
him
welcome
to
villanow
requesting
at
the
same
time
that
his
men
might
be
directed
to
rest
till
morning
and
that
he
and
the
officers
would
take
their
refreshment
within
the
palace
as
soon
as
thaddeus
had
seen
his
guests
seated
at
different
tables
in
the
and
had
given
orders
for
the
soldiers
to
be
served
from
the
buttery
and
cellars
he
withdrew
to
seek
the
countess
he
found
her
in
her
chamber
surrounded
by
the
attendants
who
had
just
informed
her
of
his
arrival
the
moment
he
appeared
at
the
room
door
the
women
went
out
at
an
opposite
passage
and
thaddeus
with
a
bursting
heart
threw
himself
on
the
bosom
of
his
mother
they
were
silent
for
some
time
poignant
recollection
stopped
their
utterance
but
neither
tears
nor
sighs
filled
its
place
until
the
countess
on
whose
soul
the
full
tide
of
maternal
affection
pressed
and
mingled
with
her
grief
raised
her
head
from
her
son
neck
and
said
whilst
she
strained
him
in
her
arms
receive
my
thanks
o
father
of
mercy
for
having
spared
to
me
this
blessing
thaddeus
sobieski
all
that
now
remained
of
that
beloved
and
honored
name
with
a
sacred
emotion
breathed
a
response
to
the
address
of
his
mother
and
drying
her
tears
with
his
kisses
dwelt
upon
the
fame
of
his
revered
grandfather
upon
his
preferable
lot
to
that
of
their
brave
friend
kosciusko
who
was
doomed
not
only
to
survive
the
liberty
of
his
country
but
to
pass
the
residue
of
his
life
within
the
dungeons
of
his
enemies
he
then
tried
to
reanimate
her
spirits
with
hope
he
spoke
of
the
approaching
battle
without
any
doubt
of
the
valor
and
desperation
of
the
poles
rendering
it
successful
he
talked
of
the
resolution
of
their
leader
general
wawrzecki
and
of
his
own
good
faith
in
the
justice
of
their
cause
his
discourse
began
in
a
wish
to
cheat
her
into
tranquillity
but
as
he
advanced
on
the
subject
his
soul
took
fire
at
its
own
warmth
and
he
half
believed
the
probability
of
his
anticipations
the
countess
looked
on
the
honorable
glow
which
crimsoned
his
harassed
features
with
a
pang
at
her
heart
my
heroic
son
cried
she
my
darling
thaddeus
what
a
vast
price
do
i
pay
for
all
this
excellence
i
could
not
love
you
were
you
otherwise
than
what
you
are
and
being
what
you
are
oh
how
soon
may
i
lose
you
already
has
your
noble
grandfather
paid
the
debt
which
he
owed
to
his
glory
he
promised
to
fall
with
poland
he
has
kept
his
word
and
now
all
that
i
love
on
earth
is
concentrated
in
you
the
countess
paused
and
pressing
his
hand
almost
wildly
on
her
heart
she
continued
in
a
hurried
voice
the
same
spirit
is
in
your
breast
the
same
principle
binds
you
and
i
may
be
at
last
left
alone
heaven
have
pity
on
me
she
cast
her
eyes
upward
as
she
ended
thaddeus
sinking
on
his
knees
by
her
side
implored
her
with
all
the
earnestness
of
piety
and
confidence
to
take
comfort
the
countess
embraced
him
with
a
forced
smile
you
must
forgive
me
thaddeus
i
have
nothing
of
the
soldier
in
my
heart
it
is
all
woman
but
i
will
not
detain
you
longer
from
the
rest
you
require
go
to
your
room
and
try
and
recruit
yourself
for
the
dangers
will
bring
forth
i
shall
employ
the
night
in
prayers
for
your
safety
consoled
to
see
any
composure
in
his
mother
he
withdrew
and
after
having
heard
that
his
numerous
guests
were
properly
lodged
went
to
his
own
chamber
next
morning
at
sunrise
the
troops
prepared
to
march
general
wawrzecki
with
his
officers
begged
permission
to
pay
their
personal
gratitude
to
the
countess
for
the
hospitality
of
her
reception
but
she
declined
the
honor
on
the
plea
of
indisposition
in
the
course
of
an
hour
her
son
appeared
from
her
apartment
and
joined
the
general
the
soldiers
filed
off
through
the
gates
crossed
the
bridge
and
halted
under
the
walls
of
praga
the
lines
of
the
camp
were
drawn
and
fortified
before
evening
at
which
time
they
found
leisure
to
observe
the
enemy
strength
russia
seemed
to
have
exhausted
her
wide
regions
to
people
the
narrow
shores
of
the
vistula
from
east
to
west
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
her
arms
were
stretched
to
the
horizon
sobieski
looked
at
them
and
then
on
the
handful
of
intrepid
hearts
contained
in
the
small
circumference
of
the
polish
camp
sighing
heavily
he
retired
into
his
tent
and
vainly
seeking
repose
mixed
his
short
and
startled
slumbers
with
frequent
prayers
for
the
preservation
of
these
last
victims
to
their
country
the
hours
appeared
to
stand
still
several
times
he
rose
from
his
bed
and
went
to
the
door
to
see
whether
the
clouds
were
tinged
with
any
appearance
of
dawn
all
continued
dark
he
again
returned
to
his
marquée
and
standing
by
the
lamp
which
was
nearly
exhausted
took
out
his
watch
and
tried
to
distinguish
the
points
but
finding
that
the
light
burned
too
feebly
he
was
pressing
the
repeating
spring
which
struck
five
when
the
report
of
a
single
musket
made
him
start
he
flew
to
his
tent
door
and
looking
around
saw
that
all
near
his
quarter
was
at
rest
suspecting
it
to
be
a
signal
of
the
enemy
he
hurried
towards
the
intrenchments
but
found
the
sentinels
in
perfect
security
from
any
fears
respecting
the
sound
as
they
supposed
it
to
have
proceeded
from
the
town
sobieski
paid
little
attention
to
their
opinions
but
ascending
the
nearest
bastion
to
take
a
wider
survey
in
a
few
minutes
he
discerned
though
obscurely
through
the
gleams
of
morning
what
appeared
to
be
the
whole
host
of
russia
advancing
in
profound
silence
towards
the
polish
lines
the
instant
he
made
this
discovery
he
came
down
and
lost
no
time
in
giving
orders
for
the
defence
then
flying
to
other
parts
of
the
camp
he
awakened
the
encouraged
the
men
and
saw
that
the
whole
encampment
was
not
only
in
motion
but
prepared
for
the
assault
in
consequence
of
these
prompt
arrangements
the
assailants
were
received
with
a
of
the
batteries
and
and
musketry
from
several
redoubts
which
raked
their
flanks
as
they
advanced
but
in
defiance
of
this
shower
of
bullets
they
pressed
on
with
an
intrepidity
worthy
of
a
better
cause
and
overleaping
the
ditch
by
squadrons
entered
the
camp
a
passage
once
secured
the
cossacks
rushed
in
by
thousands
and
spreading
themselves
in
front
of
the
storming
party
put
every
soul
to
the
spear
who
opposed
them
the
polish
works
being
gained
the
enemy
turned
the
cannon
on
its
former
masters
and
as
they
rallied
to
the
defence
of
what
remained
swept
them
down
by
whole
regiments
the
noise
of
artillery
thundered
from
all
sides
of
the
camp
the
smoke
was
so
great
that
it
was
hardly
possible
to
distinguish
friends
from
foes
nevertheless
the
spirits
of
the
poles
flagged
not
a
moment
as
fast
as
one
rampart
was
wrested
from
them
they
threw
themselves
within
another
which
was
as
speedily
taken
by
the
help
of
hurdles
fascines
ladders
and
a
courage
as
resistless
as
it
was
ferocious
merciless
and
sanguinary
every
spot
of
vantage
position
was
at
length
lost
and
yet
the
poles
fought
like
lions
quarter
was
neither
offered
to
them
nor
required
they
disputed
every
inch
of
ground
until
they
fell
upon
it
in
heaps
some
lying
before
the
parapets
others
filling
the
ditches
and
the
rest
covering
the
earth
for
the
enemy
to
tread
on
as
they
cut
their
passage
to
the
heart
of
the
camp
sobieski
almost
maddened
by
the
scene
dripping
with
his
own
blood
and
that
of
his
brave
friends
was
seen
in
every
part
of
the
action
he
was
in
the
fosse
defending
the
trampled
bodies
of
the
dying
he
was
on
the
dyke
animating
the
few
who
survived
wawrzecki
was
wounded
and
every
hope
hung
upon
thaddeus
his
presence
and
voice
infused
new
energy
into
the
arms
of
his
fainting
countrymen
they
kept
close
to
his
side
until
the
victors
enraged
at
the
dauntless
intrepidity
of
this
young
hero
uttered
the
most
fearful
imprecations
and
rushing
on
his
little
phalanx
attacked
it
with
redoubled
numbers
and
fury
sobieski
sustained
the
shock
with
firmness
but
wherever
he
turned
his
eyes
they
were
blasted
with
some
object
which
made
them
recoil
he
beheld
his
companions
and
his
soldiers
strewing
the
earth
and
their
triumphant
adversaries
mounting
their
dying
bodies
as
they
hastened
with
loud
huzzas
to
the
destruction
of
praga
whose
gates
were
now
burst
open
his
eyes
grew
dim
at
the
sight
and
at
the
very
moment
in
which
he
tore
them
from
spectacles
so
deadly
to
his
heart
a
livonian
officer
struck
him
with
a
sabre
to
all
appearance
dead
upon
the
field
when
he
recovered
from
the
blow
which
having
lit
on
the
steel
of
his
cap
had
only
stunned
him
he
looked
around
and
found
that
all
near
him
was
quiet
but
a
far
different
scene
presented
itself
from
the
town
the
roar
of
cannon
and
the
bursting
of
bombs
thundered
through
the
air
which
was
rendered
livid
and
tremendous
by
long
spires
of
fire
streaming
from
the
burning
houses
and
mingling
with
the
volumes
of
smoke
which
rolled
from
the
guns
the
dreadful
tocsin
and
the
hurrahs
of
the
victors
pierced
the
soul
of
thaddeus
springing
from
the
ground
he
was
preparing
to
rush
towards
the
gates
when
loud
cries
of
distress
issued
from
within
they
were
burst
open
and
a
moment
after
the
grand
magazine
blew
up
with
a
horrible
explosion
in
an
instant
the
field
before
praga
was
filled
with
women
and
children
flying
in
all
directions
and
rending
the
sky
with
their
shrieks
father
almighty
cried
thaddeus
wringing
his
hands
canst
thou
suffer
this
whilst
he
yet
spake
some
straggling
cossacks
near
the
town
who
were
prowling
about
glutted
but
not
sated
with
blood
seized
the
poor
fugitives
and
with
a
ferocity
as
wanton
as
unmanly
released
them
at
once
from
life
and
misery
this
hideous
spectacle
brought
his
mother
defenceless
state
before
the
eyes
of
sobieski
her
palace
was
only
four
miles
distant
and
whilst
the
barbarous
avidity
of
the
enemy
was
too
busily
engaged
in
sacking
the
place
to
permit
them
to
perceive
a
solitary
individual
hurrying
away
amidst
heaps
of
dead
bodies
he
flew
across
the
desolated
meadows
which
intervened
between
praga
and
villanow
thaddeus
was
met
at
the
gate
of
his
palace
by
general
butzou
who
having
learned
the
fate
of
praga
from
the
noise
and
flames
in
that
quarter
anticipated
the
arrival
of
some
part
of
the
victorious
army
before
the
walls
of
villanow
when
its
young
count
with
a
breaking
heart
crossed
the
drawbridge
he
saw
that
the
worthy
veteran
had
prepared
everything
for
a
stout
resistance
the
ramparts
were
lined
with
soldiers
and
well
mounted
with
artillery
here
thou
still
honored
sobieski
cried
he
as
he
conducted
thaddeus
to
the
keep
let
the
worst
happen
here
i
am
resolved
to
dispute
the
possession
of
your
grandfather
palace
until
i
have
not
a
man
to
stand
by
me
footnote
it
was
little
more
than
just
a
century
before
this
awful
scene
took
place
that
the
invincible
john
sobieski
king
of
poland
acting
upon
the
old
mutually
protecting
principles
of
christendom
saved
the
freedom
and
the
faith
of
christian
europe
from
the
turkish
yoke
and
in
this
very
mansion
he
passed
his
latter
years
in
honored
peace
he
died
in
a
remarkable
coincidence
the
division
of
poland
occurring
in
thaddeus
strained
him
in
silence
to
his
breast
and
after
examining
the
force
and
dispositions
he
approved
all
with
a
cold
despair
of
their
being
of
any
effectual
use
and
went
to
the
apartments
of
his
mother
the
countess
women
who
met
him
in
the
vestibule
begged
him
to
be
careful
how
he
entered
her
excellency
room
for
she
had
only
just
recovered
from
a
swoon
occasioned
by
alarm
at
hearing
the
cannonade
against
the
polish
camp
her
son
waited
for
no
more
but
not
hearing
their
caution
threw
open
the
door
of
the
chamber
and
hastening
to
his
mother
couch
cast
himself
into
her
arms
she
clung
round
his
neck
and
for
a
while
joy
stopped
her
respiration
bursting
into
tears
she
wept
over
him
incapable
of
expressing
by
words
her
tumultuous
gratitude
at
again
beholding
him
alive
he
looked
on
her
altered
and
pallid
features
o
my
mother
cried
he
clasping
her
to
his
breast
you
are
ill
and
what
will
become
of
you
my
beloved
son
replied
she
kissing
his
forehead
through
the
clotted
blood
that
oozed
from
a
cut
on
his
temple
my
beloved
son
before
our
cruel
murderers
can
arrive
i
shall
have
found
a
refuge
in
the
bosom
of
my
god
thaddeus
could
only
answer
with
a
groan
she
resumed
give
me
your
hand
i
must
not
witness
the
grandson
of
sobieski
given
up
to
despair
let
your
mother
incite
you
to
resignation
you
see
i
have
not
breathed
a
complaining
word
although
i
behold
you
covered
with
wounds
as
she
spoke
her
eye
pointed
to
the
sash
and
handkerchief
which
were
bound
round
his
thigh
and
arm
our
separation
will
not
be
long
a
few
short
years
perhaps
hours
may
unite
us
forever
in
a
better
world
the
count
was
still
speechless
he
could
only
press
her
hand
to
his
lips
after
a
pause
she
proceeded
look
up
my
dear
boy
and
attend
to
me
should
poland
become
the
property
of
other
nations
i
conjure
you
if
you
survive
its
fall
to
leave
it
when
reduced
to
captivity
it
will
no
longer
be
an
asylum
for
a
man
of
honor
i
beseech
you
should
this
happen
go
that
very
hour
to
england
that
is
a
free
country
and
i
have
been
told
that
the
people
are
kind
to
the
unfortunate
perhaps
you
will
find
that
pembroke
somerset
hath
not
quite
forgotten
poland
thaddeus
why
do
you
delay
to
answer
me
remember
these
are
your
mother
dying
words
i
will
obey
them
my
mother
then
continued
she
taking
from
her
bosom
a
small
miniature
let
me
tie
this
round
your
neck
it
is
the
portrait
of
your
father
thaddeus
bent
his
head
and
the
countess
fastened
it
under
his
cloth
prize
this
gift
my
child
it
is
likely
to
be
all
that
you
will
now
inherit
either
from
me
or
that
father
try
to
forget
his
injustice
my
dear
son
and
in
memory
of
me
never
part
with
that
picture
o
thaddeus
from
the
moment
in
which
i
first
received
it
until
this
instant
it
has
never
been
from
my
heart
and
it
shall
never
leave
mine
answered
he
in
a
stifled
voice
whilst
i
have
being
the
countess
was
preparing
to
reply
when
a
sudden
volley
of
firearms
made
thaddeus
spring
upon
his
feet
loud
cries
succeeded
women
rushed
into
the
apartment
screaming
the
ramparts
are
stormed
and
the
next
moment
that
quarter
of
the
building
rocked
to
its
foundation
the
countess
clung
to
the
bosom
of
her
son
thaddeus
clasped
her
close
to
his
breast
and
casting
up
his
petitioning
eyes
to
heaven
cried
shield
of
the
desolate
grant
me
a
shelter
for
my
mother
another
burst
of
cannon
was
followed
by
a
heavy
crash
and
the
most
piercing
shrieks
echoed
through
the
palace
all
is
lost
cried
a
soldier
who
appeared
for
an
instant
at
the
room
door
and
then
vanished
thaddeus
overwhelmed
with
despair
grasped
his
sword
which
had
fallen
to
the
ground
and
crying
my
mother
we
will
die
together
would
have
given
her
one
last
and
assuring
embrace
when
his
eyes
met
the
sight
of
her
features
tranquillized
in
death
she
fell
from
his
palsied
arms
back
on
the
couch
and
he
stood
gazing
on
her
as
if
struck
by
a
power
which
had
benumbed
all
his
faculties
the
tumult
in
the
palace
increased
every
moment
but
he
heard
it
not
until
butzou
followed
by
two
or
three
of
his
soldiers
ran
into
the
apartment
calling
out
count
save
yourself
sobieski
still
remained
motionless
the
general
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
instantly
covering
the
body
of
the
deceased
countess
with
the
mantle
of
her
son
hurried
his
unconscious
steps
by
an
opposite
door
through
the
state
chambers
into
the
gardens
thaddeus
did
not
recover
his
recollection
until
he
reached
the
outward
gate
then
breaking
from
the
hold
of
his
friend
was
returning
to
the
sorrowful
scene
he
had
left
when
butzou
aware
of
his
intentions
just
stopped
him
in
time
to
prevent
his
rushing
on
the
bayonets
of
a
party
of
the
enemy
infantry
who
were
pursuing
them
at
full
speed
the
count
now
rallied
his
distracted
faculties
and
making
a
stand
with
the
general
and
his
three
poles
they
compelled
this
merciless
detachment
to
seek
refuge
among
the
arcades
of
the
building
butzou
would
not
allow
his
young
lord
to
follow
in
that
direction
but
hurried
him
across
the
park
he
looked
back
however
a
column
of
fire
issued
from
the
south
towers
thaddeus
sighed
as
if
his
life
were
in
that
sigh
all
is
indeed
over
and
pressing
his
hand
to
his
forehead
in
that
attitude
followed
the
steps
of
the
general
towards
the
vistula
the
wind
being
very
high
the
flame
soon
spread
itself
over
the
roof
of
the
palace
and
catching
at
every
combustible
in
its
way
the
invaders
became
so
terrified
at
the
quick
progress
of
fire
which
threatened
to
consume
themselves
as
well
as
their
plunder
that
they
quitted
the
spot
with
precipitation
decrying
the
count
and
his
soldiers
at
a
short
distance
they
directed
their
motions
to
that
point
speedily
confronting
the
brave
fugitives
they
blocked
up
a
bridge
by
a
file
of
men
with
fixed
pikes
and
not
only
menaced
the
polanders
as
they
advanced
but
derided
their
means
of
resistance
sobieski
indifferent
alike
to
danger
and
to
insults
stopped
short
to
the
left
and
followed
by
his
friends
plunged
into
the
stream
amidst
a
shower
of
from
the
enemy
after
hard
buffeting
with
the
torrent
he
at
last
reached
the
opposite
bank
and
was
assisted
from
the
river
by
some
of
the
weeping
inhabitants
of
warsaw
who
had
been
watching
the
expiring
ashes
of
praga
and
the
flames
then
devouring
the
boasted
towers
of
villanow
emerged
from
the
water
thaddeus
stood
to
regain
his
breath
and
leaning
on
the
shoulder
of
butzou
he
pointed
to
his
burning
palace
with
a
smile
of
agony
see
said
he
what
a
funeral
pile
heaven
has
given
to
the
manes
of
my
unburied
mother
the
general
did
not
speak
for
grief
stopped
his
utterance
but
motioning
the
two
soldiers
to
proceed
he
supported
the
count
into
the
citadel
chapter
sobieski
departure
from
warsaw
from
the
termination
of
this
awful
day
in
which
a
brave
and
hitherto
powerful
people
were
consigned
to
an
abject
dependence
thaddeus
was
confined
to
his
apartment
in
the
garrison
it
was
now
the
latter
end
of
november
general
butzou
supposing
that
the
illness
of
his
young
lord
might
continue
some
weeks
and
aware
that
no
time
ought
to
be
lost
in
maintaining
all
that
was
yet
left
of
the
kingdom
of
poland
obtained
his
permission
to
seek
its
only
remaining
quarter
quitting
warsaw
he
joined
prince
poniatowski
who
was
yet
at
the
head
of
a
few
troops
near
sachoryn
supported
by
the
undaunted
niemcivitz
the
bard
and
the
hero
who
had
fought
by
the
side
heart
would
have
thrown
himself
on
his
knee
but
the
king
presented
him
and
pressed
him
with
emotion
in
his
arms
brave
young
man
cried
he
i
embrace
in
you
the
last
of
those
polish
youth
who
were
so
lately
the
brightest
jewels
in
my
crown
tears
stood
in
the
monarch
eyes
while
he
spoke
sobieski
with
hardly
a
steadier
utterance
answered
i
come
to
receive
your
majesty
commands
i
will
obey
them
in
all
things
but
in
surrendering
this
sword
which
was
my
grandfather
into
the
hands
of
your
enemies
i
will
not
desire
it
replied
stanislaus
by
my
acquiescence
with
the
terms
of
russia
i
only
comply
with
the
earnest
petitions
of
my
people
i
shall
not
require
of
you
to
compromise
your
country
but
alas
you
must
not
throw
away
your
life
in
a
now
hopeless
cause
fate
has
consigned
poland
to
subjection
and
when
heaven
in
its
mysterious
decrees
confirms
the
chastisement
of
nations
it
is
duty
to
submit
for
myself
i
am
to
bury
my
griefs
and
indignities
in
the
castle
of
grodno
the
blood
rushed
over
the
cheek
of
thaddeus
at
this
declaration
to
which
the
proud
indignation
of
his
soul
could
in
no
way
subscribe
and
with
an
agitated
voice
he
exclaimed
if
my
sovereign
be
already
at
the
command
of
our
oppressors
then
indeed
is
poland
no
more
and
i
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
perform
the
dying
will
of
my
mother
will
your
majesty
grant
me
permission
to
set
off
for
england
before
i
may
be
obliged
to
witness
the
last
calamity
of
my
wretched
country
i
would
to
heaven
replied
the
king
that
i
too
might
repose
my
age
and
sorrows
in
that
happy
kingdom
go
sobieski
your
name
is
worthy
of
such
an
asylum
my
prayers
and
blessings
shall
follow
you
thaddeus
pressed
his
hand
in
silence
to
his
lips
believe
me
my
dear
count
continued
stanislaus
my
soul
bleeds
at
this
parting
i
know
the
treasure
which
your
family
has
always
been
to
this
nation
i
know
your
own
individual
merit
i
know
the
wealth
which
you
have
sacrificed
for
me
and
my
subjects
and
i
am
powerless
to
express
my
gratitude
had
i
done
more
than
my
duty
in
that
replied
thaddeus
such
words
from
your
majesty
would
have
been
a
reward
adequate
to
any
privation
but
alas
no
i
have
perhaps
performed
less
than
my
duty
the
blood
of
sobieski
ought
not
to
have
been
spared
one
drop
when
the
liberties
of
his
country
perished
thaddeus
blushed
while
he
spoke
and
almost
repented
the
too
ready
zeal
of
his
friends
in
having
saved
him
from
the
general
destruction
at
villanow
the
voice
of
the
venerable
stanislaus
became
fainter
as
he
resumed
perhaps
had
a
sobieski
reigned
at
this
time
these
horrors
might
not
have
been
accomplished
that
resistless
power
which
has
overwhelmed
my
people
i
can
not
forget
is
the
same
that
put
the
sceptre
into
my
hand
but
catherine
misunderstood
my
principles
when
assisting
in
my
election
to
the
throne
she
thought
she
was
planting
merely
her
own
viceroy
there
but
i
could
not
obliterate
from
my
heart
that
my
ancestors
like
your
own
were
hereditary
sovereigns
of
poland
nor
cease
to
feel
the
stamp
the
king
of
kings
had
graven
upon
that
heart
to
uphold
the
just
laws
of
my
fathers
and
to
the
utmost
i
have
struggled
to
fulfil
my
trust
yes
my
sovereign
replied
thaddeus
and
whilst
there
remains
one
man
on
earth
who
has
drawn
his
first
breath
in
poland
he
will
bear
witness
in
all
the
lands
through
which
he
may
be
doomed
to
wander
that
he
has
received
from
you
the
care
and
affection
of
a
father
o
sire
how
will
future
ages
believe
that
in
the
midst
of
civilized
europe
a
brave
people
and
a
virtuous
monarch
were
suffered
unaided
and
even
without
remonstrance
to
fall
into
the
grasp
of
usurpation
nay
of
annihilation
of
their
name
stanislaus
laid
his
hand
on
the
arm
of
the
count
man
ambition
and
baseness
said
the
king
are
monstrous
to
the
contemplation
of
youth
only
you
are
learning
your
lesson
early
i
have
studied
mine
for
many
years
and
with
a
bitterness
of
soul
which
in
some
measure
prepared
me
for
the
completion
my
kingdom
has
passed
from
me
at
the
moment
you
have
lost
your
country
before
we
part
forever
my
dear
sobieski
take
with
you
this
assurance
you
have
served
the
unfortunate
stanislaus
to
the
latest
hour
in
which
you
beheld
him
that
which
you
have
just
said
expressive
of
the
sentiments
of
those
who
were
my
subjects
is
indeed
a
balm
to
my
heart
and
i
will
earn
its
consolations
to
my
prison
the
king
paused
sobieski
agitated
and
incapable
of
speaking
threw
himself
at
his
majesty
feet
and
pressed
his
hand
with
fervency
and
anguish
to
his
lips
the
king
looked
down
on
his
graceful
figure
and
pierced
to
the
soul
by
the
more
graceful
feelings
which
dictated
the
action
the
tear
which
stood
in
his
eye
rolled
over
his
cheek
and
was
followed
by
another
before
he
could
add
pented
the
too
ready
zeal
of
his
friends
in

saved
him
from

you
beheld
him
that
which
you
have
just
said
expressive
of
the
sentiments
of
those
who
were
my
subjects
is
indeed
a
balm
to
my
heart
and
i
will
carry
its
consolations
to
my
prison
the
king
paused
sobieski
agitated
and
incapable
of
speaking
threw
himself
at
his
majesty
feet
and
pressed
his
hand
with
fervency
and
anguish
to
his
lips
the
king
looked
down
on
his
graceful
figure
and
pierced
to
the
soul
by
the
more
graceful
feelings
which
dictated
the
action
the
tear
which
stood
in
his
eye
rolled
over
his
cheek
and
was
followed
by
another
before
he
could
add
rise
my
young
friend
take
from
me
this
ring
it
contains
my
picture
wear
it
in
remembrance
of
a
man
who
loves
you
and
who
can
never
forget
your
worth
or
the
loyalty
and
patriotism
of
your
house
the
chancellor
zamoyisko
at
that
moment
being
announced
thaddeus
rose
from
his
knee
and
was
preparing
to
leave
the
room
when
his
majesty
perceiving
his
intention
desired
him
to
stop
stay
count
cried
he
i
will
burden
you
with
one
request
i
am
now
a
king
without
a
crown
without
subjects
without
a
foot
of
land
in
which
to
bury
me
when
i
die
i
can
not
reward
the
fidelity
of
any
one
of
the
few
friends
of
whom
my
enemies
have
not
deprived
me
but
you
are
young
and
heaven
may
yet
smile
upon
you
in
some
distant
nation
will
you
pay
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
your
poor
sovereign
should
you
ever
again
meet
with
the
good
old
butzou
who
rescued
me
when
my
preservation
lay
on
the
fortune
of
a
moment
remember
that
i
regard
him
as
once
the
saviour
of
my
life
i
was
told
that
on
the
destruction
of
praga
this
brave
man
joined
the
army
of
my
brother
it
is
now
disbanded
and
he
with
the
rest
of
my
faithful
soldiers
is
cast
forth
in
his
old
age
a
wanderer
in
a
pitiless
world
should
you
ever
meet
him
sobieski
succor
him
for
my
sake
as
heaven
may
succor
me
cried
thaddeus
and
putting
his
hand
a
second
time
to
his
lips
he
bowed
to
the
chancellor
and
passed
into
the
street
when
the
count
returned
to
the
citadel
he
found
that
all
was
as
the
king
had
represented
the
soldiers
in
the
garrison
were
reluctantly
preparing
to
give
up
their
arms
and
the
nobles
in
compassion
to
the
cries
of
the
people
were
trying
to
humble
their
necks
to
the
yoke
of
the
dictator
the
magistrates
lingered
as
they
went
to
take
the
city
keys
from
the
hands
of
their
good
king
and
with
sad
whispers
anticipated
the
moment
in
which
they
must
surrender
them
and
their
laws
and
national
existence
to
the
jealous
dominion
of
three
despotic
foreign
powers
poland
was
now
no
place
for
sobieski
he
had
survived
all
his
kindred
he
had
survived
the
liberties
of
his
country
he
had
seen
the
king
a
prisoner
and
his
countrymen
trampled
on
by
deceit
and
usurpation
as
he
walked
on
musing
over
these
circumstances
he
met
with
little
interruption
for
the
streets
were
deserted
here
and
there
a
poor
miserable
wretch
passed
him
who
seemed
by
his
wan
cheeks
and
haggard
eyes
already
to
repent
the
too
successful
prayers
of
the
deputation
the
shops
were
shut
thaddeus
stopped
a
few
minutes
in
the
great
square
which
used
to
be
crowded
with
happy
citizens
but
now
not
one
man
was
to
be
seen
an
awful
and
painful
silence
reigned
over
all
his
soul
felt
too
truly
the
dread
consciousness
of
this
utter
annihilation
of
his
country
for
him
to
throw
off
the
heavy
load
from
his
oppressed
heart
in
this
his
last
walk
down
the
east
street
towards
the
ramparts
which
covered
the
vistula
he
turned
his
eyes
to
the
spot
where
once
stood
the
magnificent
towers
of
his
paternal
palace
yes
cried
he
it
is
now
time
for
me
to
obey
the
last
command
of
my
mother
nothing
remains
of
poland
but
its
soil
nothing
of
my
home
but
its
ashes
the
victors
had
pitched
a
detachment
of
tents
amidst
the
ruins
of
villanow
and
were
at
this
moment
busying
themselves
in
searching
amongst
the
stupendous
fragments
for
what
plunder
the
fire
might
have
spared
insatiate
robbers
exclaimed
thaddeus
heaven
will
requite
this
sacrilege
he
thought
on
his
mother
who
lay
beneath
the
ruins
and
tore
himself
from
the
sight
whilst
he
added
farewell
forever
farewell
thou
beloved
revered
villanow
where
i
was
reared
in
bliss
and
tenderness
i
quit
thee
and
my
country
forever
as
he
spoke
he
raised
his
hands
and
eyes
to
heaven
and
pressing
the
picture
his
mother
had
given
him
to
his
lips
and
bosom
turned
from
the
parapet
determining
to
prepare
that
night
for
his
departure
the
next
morning
he
arose
by
daybreak
and
having
gathered
together
all
his
little
wealth
the
whole
of
which
was
compressed
within
the
portmanteau
that
was
buckled
on
his
gallant
horse
precisely
two
hours
before
the
triumphal
car
of
general
suwarrow
entered
warsaw
sobieski
left
it
as
he
rode
along
the
streets
he
bedewed
its
stones
with
his
tears
they
were
the
first
that
he
had
shed
during
the
long
series
of
his
misfortunes
and
they
now
flowed
so
fast
that
he
could
hardly
discern
his
way
out
of
the
city
at
the
great
gate
his
horse
stopped
and
neighed
with
a
strange
sound
poor
saladin
cried
thaddeus
stroking
his
neck
are
you
so
sorry
at
leaving
warsaw
that
like
your
unhappy
master
you
linger
to
take
a
last
lamenting
look
his
tears
redoubled
and
the
warder
as
he
closed
the
gate
after
him
implored
permission
to
kiss
the
hand
of
the
noble
count
sobieski
ere
he
should
turn
his
back
on
poland
never
to
return
thaddeus
looked
kindly
round
and
shaking
hands
with
the
honest
man
after
saying
a
few
friendly
words
to
him
rode
on
with
a
loitering
pace
until
he
reached
that
part
of
the
river
which
divides
masovia
from
the
prussian
dominions
here
he
flung
himself
off
his
horse
and
standing
for
a
moment
on
the
hill
that
rises
near
the
bridge
retraced
with
his
almost
blinded
sight
the
long
and
desolated
lands
through
which
he
had
passed
then
involuntarily
dropping
on
his
knee
he
plucked
a
tuft
of
grass
and
pressing
it
to
his
lips
exclaimed
farewell
poland
farewell
all
my
earthly
happiness
almost
stifled
by
emotion
he
put
this
poor
relic
of
his
country
into
his
bosom
and
remounting
his
noble
animal
crossed
the
bridge
as
one
who
flying
from
any
particular
object
thinks
to
lose
himself
and
his
sorrows
when
it
lessens
to
his
view
sobieski
pursued
the
remainder
of
his
journey
with
a
speed
which
soon
brought
him
to
dantzic
here
he
remained
a
few
days
and
during
that
interval
the
firmness
of
his
mind
was
restored
he
felt
a
calm
arising
from
the
conviction
that
his
afflictions
had
gained
their
summit
and
that
however
heavy
they
were
heaven
had
laid
them
on
him
for
a
trial
of
his
faith
and
virtue
under
this
belief
he
ceased
to
weep
but
he
never
was
seen
to
smile
having
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
master
of
a
vessel
to
carry
him
across
the
sea
he
found
the
strength
of
his
finances
would
barely
defray
the
charges
of
the
voyage
considering
this
circumstance
he
saw
the
impossibility
of
taking
his
horse
to
england
the
first
time
this
idea
presented
itself
it
almost
overset
his
determined
resignation
tears
would
again
have
started
into
his
eyes
had
he
not
by
force
repelled
them
to
part
from
my
faithful
saladin
said
he
to
himself
that
has
borne
me
since
i
first
could
use
a
sword
that
has
carried
me
through
so
many
dangers
and
has
come
with
me
even
into
exile
it
is
painful
it
is
ungrateful
he
was
in
the
stable
when
this
thought
assailed
him
and
as
the
reflections
followed
each
other
he
again
turned
to
the
stall
but
my
poor
fellow
i
will
not
barter
your
services
for
gold
i
will
seek
for
some
master
who
may
be
kind
to
you
in
pity
to
my
misfortunes
he
the
hotel
where
he
lodged
and
calling
a
waiter
inquired
who
occupied
the
fine
mansion
and
park
on
the
east
of
the
town
the
man
replied
hopetown
an
eminent
british
merchant
who
has
been
settled
at
dantzic
above
forty
years
i
am
glad
he
is
a
briton
was
the
sentiment
which
succeeded
this
information
in
the
count
mind
he
immediately
took
his
resolution
but
hardly
had
prepared
to
put
it
into
execution
when
he
received
a
summons
from
the
vessel
to
be
on
board
in
half
an
hour
the
wind
having
set
fair
thaddeus
somewhat
disconcerted
by
this
hasty
call
with
an
agitated
hand
wrote
the
following
letter
to
john
hopetown
esq
sir
a
polish
officer
who
has
sacrificed
everything
but
his
honor
to
the
last
interests
of
his
country
now
addresses
you
you
are
a
briton
and
of
whom
can
an
unhappy
victim
to
the
cause
of
loyalty
and
freedom
with
less
debasement
solicit
an
obligation
i
can
not
afford
support
to
the
fine
animal
which
has
carried
me
through
the
battles
of
this
fatal
war
i
disdain
to
sell
him
and
therefore
i
implore
you
by
the
respect
that
you
pay
to
the
memory
of
your
ancestors
who
struggled
for
and
retained
that
liberty
in
defence
of
which
we
are
thus
reduced
i
implore
you
to
give
him
an
asylum
in
your
park
and
to
protect
him
from
injurious
usage
perform
this
benevolent
action
sir
and
you
shall
ever
be
remembered
with
gratitude
by
an
unfortunate
polander
dantzic
the
count
having
sealed
and
directed
this
letter
went
to
the
hotel
yard
and
ordered
that
his
horse
might
be
brought
out
a
few
days
of
rest
had
restored
him
to
his
former
mettle
and
he
appeared
from
the
stable
prancing
and
pawing
the
earth
as
he
used
to
do
when
thaddeus
was
about
to
mount
him
for
the
field
the
groom
was
striving
in
vain
to
restrain
the
spirit
of
the
animal
when
the
count
took
hold
of
the
bridle
the
noble
creature
knew
his
master
and
became
gentle
as
a
lamb
after
stroking
him
two
or
three
times
with
a
bursting
heart
thaddeus
returned
the
reins
to
the
hand
and
at
the
same
time
gave
him
a
letter
there
said
he
take
that
note
and
the
horse
directly
to
the
house
of
hopetown
leave
them
for
the
letter
requires
no
answer
this
last
pang
mastered
he
walked
out
of
the
yard
towards
the
quay
the
wind
continuing
fair
he
entered
the
ship
and
within
an
hour
set
sail
for
england
chapter
xi
the
baltic
sobieski
passed
the
greater
part
of
each
day
and
the
whole
of
every
night
on
the
deck
of
the
vessel
he
was
too
much
absorbed
in
himself
to
receive
any
amusement
from
the
passengers
who
observing
his
melancholy
thought
to
dispel
it
by
their
company
and
conversation
when
any
of
these
people
came
upon
deck
he
walked
to
the
head
of
the
ship
took
his
seat
upon
the
cable
which
bound
the
anchor
to
the
forecastle
and
while
their
fears
rendered
him
safe
from
their
meant
persecution
he
gained
some
respite
from
vexation
though
none
from
misery
the
ship
having
passed
through
the
baltic
and
entered
on
the
british
sea
the
passengers
running
from
side
to
side
of
the
vessels
pointed
out
to
thaddeus
the
distant
shore
of
england
lying
like
a
hazy
ridge
along
the
horizon
the
happy
people
whilst
they
strained
their
eyes
through
glasses
desired
him
to
observe
different
spots
on
the
line
which
they
called
flamborough
head
and
the
hills
of
yorkshire
his
heart
turned
sick
at
these
objects
of
their
delight
for
not
one
of
them
raised
an
answering
feeling
in
his
breast
england
could
be
nothing
to
him
if
anything
it
would
prove
a
desert
which
contained
no
one
object
for
his
regrets
or
wishes
the
image
of
pembroke
somerset
indeed
rose
in
his
mind
like
the
dim
recollection
of
one
who
has
been
a
long
time
dead
whilst
they
were
together
at
villanow
they
regarded
each
other
warmly
and
when
they
parted
they
promised
to
correspond
one
day
in
pursuit
of
the
enemy
thaddeus
was
so
unlucky
as
to
lose
the
which
contained
his
friend
address
but
yet
uneasy
at
his
silence
he
ventured
two
letters
to
him
directed
merely
at
sir
robert
somerset
england
to
these
he
received
no
answer
and
the
palatine
evinced
so
just
a
displeasure
at
such
marked
neglect
and
ingratitude
that
he
would
not
suffer
him
to
be
mentioned
in
his
presence
and
indeed
thaddeus
from
disappointment
and
regret
felt
no
inclination
to
transgress
the
command
when
the
young
count
during
the
prominent
interests
of
the
late
disastrous
campaign
remembered
these
things
he
found
little
comfort
in
recollecting
the
name
of
his
young
english
guest
and
now
that
he
was
visiting
england
as
a
poor
exile
with
indignation
and
grief
he
gave
up
the
wish
with
the
hope
of
meeting
somerset
sensible
that
somerset
had
not
acted
as
became
the
man
to
whom
he
could
apply
in
his
distress
he
resolved
unfriended
as
he
was
to
wipe
him
at
once
from
his
memory
with
a
bitter
sigh
he
turned
his
back
on
the
land
to
which
he
was
going
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
tract
of
sea
which
then
divided
him
from
all
that
he
had
ever
loved
or
had
given
him
true
happiness
father
of
mercy
murmured
he
in
a
suppressed
voice
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
this
misery
why
have
i
been
at
one
stroke
deprived
of
all
that
rendered
existence
estimable
two
months
ago
i
had
a
mother
a
more
than
father
to
love
and
cherish
me
i
had
a
country
that
looked
up
to
them
and
to
me
with
veneration
and
confidence
now
i
am
bereft
of
all
i
have
neither
father
mother
nor
country
but
i
am
going
to
a
land
of
utter
strangers
such
impatient
adjurations
were
never
wrung
from
sobieski
by
the
anguish
of
sudden
torture
without
his
ingenuous
and
pious
mind
reproaching
itself
for
such
faithless
repining
his
soul
was
soft
as
a
woman
but
it
knew
neither
effeminacy
nor
despair
whilst
his
heart
bled
his
countenance
retained
its
serenity
whilst
affliction
crushed
him
to
the
earth
and
nature
paid
a
few
drops
to
his
repeated
bereavements
he
contemned
his
tears
and
raised
his
fixed
and
confiding
eye
to
that
power
which
poured
down
its
tempests
on
his
head
thaddeus
felt
as
a
man
but
received
consolation
as
a
christian
when
his
ship
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
the
thames
the
eagerness
of
the
passengers
increased
to
such
an
excess
that
they
would
not
stand
still
nor
be
silent
a
moment
and
when
the
vessel
under
full
sail
passed
sheerness
and
the
dome
of
paul
appeared
before
them
their
exclamations
were
loud
and
incessant
my
home
my
parents
my
wife
my
friends
were
the
burden
of
every
tongue
thaddeus
found
his
calmed
spirits
again
disturbed
and
rising
from
his
seat
he
retired
unobserved
by
the
people
who
were
too
happy
to
attend
to
anything
which
did
not
agree
with
their
own
transports
the
cabin
was
as
deserted
as
himself
feeling
that
there
is
no
solitude
like
that
of
the
heart
when
it
looks
around
and
sees
in
the
vast
concourse
of
human
beings
not
one
to
whom
it
can
pour
forth
its
sorrows
or
receive
the
answering
sigh
of
sympathy
he
threw
himself
on
one
of
the
lockers
and
with
difficulty
restrained
the
tears
from
gushing
from
his
eyes
he
held
his
hand
over
them
while
he
contemned
himself
for
a
weakness
so
unbecoming
his
manhood
he
despised
himself
but
let
not
others
despise
him
it
is
difficult
for
those
who
lie
morning
and
evening
in
the
lap
of
domestic
indulgence
to
conceive
the
misery
of
being
thrown
out
into
a
bleak
and
merciless
world
it
is
impossible
for
the
happy
man
surrounded
by
luxury
and
gay
companions
to
figure
to
himself
the
reflections
of
a
who
having
been
fostered
in
the
bosom
of
affection
and
elegance
is
cast
at
once
from
all
society
bereft
of
home
of
comfort
of
every
stay
save
innocence
and
heaven
none
but
the
wretched
can
imagine
what
the
wretched
endure
from
actual
distress
from
apprehended
misfortune
from
outraged
feelings
and
ten
thousand
nameless
sensibilities
to
offence
which
only
the
unfortunate
can
conceive
dread
and
experience
but
what
is
it
to
be
not
only
without
a
home
but
without
a
country
thaddeus
unconsciously
uttered
a
groan
like
that
of
death
the
noise
redoubled
above
his
head
and
in
a
few
minutes
afterwards
one
of
the
sailors
came
rumbling
clown
the
stairs
will
it
please
your
honor
said
he
to
get
up
that
be
my
chest
and
i
want
my
clothes
to
clean
myself
before
i
go
on
shore
mother
i
know
be
waiting
me
at
blackwall
thaddeus
rose
and
with
a
withered
heart
again
ascended
to
the
deck
on
coming
up
the
hatchway
he
saw
that
the
ship
was
moored
in
the
midst
of
a
large
city
and
was
surrounded
by
myriads
of
vessels
from
every
quarter
of
the
globe
he
leaned
over
the
railing
and
in
silence
looked
down
on
the
other
passengers
who
where
bearing
off
in
boats
and
shaking
hands
with
the
people
who
came
to
receive
them
it
is
near
dark
sir
said
the
captain
mayhap
you
would
wish
to
go
on
shore
there
is
a
boat
just
come
round
and
the
tide
serve
much
longer
and
as
your
friends
do
seem
to
be
coming
for
you
you
are
welcome
to
a
place
in
it
with
me
the
count
thanked
him
and
after
defraying
the
expenses
of
the
voyage
and
giving
money
amongst
the
sailors
he
desired
that
his
portmanteau
might
be
put
into
the
wherry
the
honest
fellows
in
gratitude
to
the
bounty
of
their
passenger
struggled
who
should
obey
his
commands
when
the
skipper
angry
at
being
detained
snatched
away
the
baggage
and
flinging
it
into
the
boat
leaped
in
after
it
and
was
followed
by
thaddeus
the
taciturnity
of
the
seamen
and
the
deep
melancholy
of
his
guest
were
not
broken
until
they
reached
the
tower
stairs
go
ben
fetch
the
gentleman
a
coach
the
count
bowed
to
the
captain
who
gave
the
order
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
boy
returned
saying
there
was
one
in
waiting
he
took
up
the
portmanteau
and
thaddeus
following
him
ascended
the
tower
stairs
where
the
carriage
stood
ben
threw
in
the
baggage
and
the
count
put
his
foot
on
the
step
where
must
the
man
drive
to
thaddeus
drew
it
back
again
yes
sir
continued
the
lad
where
be
your
honor
home
in
my
grave
was
the
response
his
aching
heart
made
to
this
question
he
hesitated
before
he
spoke
an
hotel
said
he
flinging
himself
on
the
seat
and
throwing
a
piece
of
silver
into
the
hat
what
hotel
sir
asked
the
coachman
any
the
man
closed
the
door
mounted
his
box
and
drove
off
it
was
now
near
seven
on
a
dark
december
evening
the
lamps
were
lighted
and
it
being
the
streets
were
crowded
with
people
thaddeus
looked
at
them
as
he
was
driven
along
happy
creatures
thought
he
you
have
each
a
home
to
go
to
you
have
each
expectant
friends
to
welcome
you
every
one
of
you
knows
some
in
the
world
who
will
smile
when
you
enter
whilst
i
wretched
wretched
sobieski
where
are
now
all
thy
treasures
thy
boasted
glory
and
those
beloved
ones
who
rendered
that
glory
most
precious
to
thee
alas
all
are
withdrawn
vanished
like
a
scene
of
enchantment
from
which
i
have
indeed
awakened
to
a
frightful
solitude
his
reflections
were
broken
by
the
stopping
of
the
carriage
the
man
opened
the
door
sir
i
have
brought
you
to
the
hummums
covent
garden
it
has
as
good
accommodations
as
any
in
the
town
my
fare
is
five
shillings
thaddeus
paid
the
amount
and
followed
him
and
his
baggage
into
the
at
the
entrance
of
a
man
of
his
figure
several
waiters
presented
themselves
begging
to
know
his
commands
i
want
a
chamber
he
was
ushered
into
a
very
handsome
where
one
of
them
laid
down
the
portmanteau
and
then
bowing
low
inquired
whether
he
had
dined
the
waiter
having
received
his
orders
for
the
count
saw
that
it
was
necessary
to
call
for
something
hastened
into
the
kitchen
to
communicate
them
to
the
cook
upon
my
word
betty
cried
he
you
must
do
your
best
for
the
chicken
is
for
the
fellow
you
ever
set
eyes
on
by
jove
i
believe
him
to
be
some
russian
nobleman
perhaps
the
great
suwarrow
himself
and
he
speaks
english
as
well
as
i
do
myself
a
prince
you
mean
jenkins
said
a
pretty
girl
who
entered
at
that
moment
since
i
was
borne
i
never
see
any
english
lord
walk
up
and
down
the
room
with
such
an
air
he
looks
like
a
king
for
my
part
i
should
not
wonder
if
he
is
one
of
them
there
emigrant
kings
for
they
say
there
is
a
power
of
them
now
wandering
about
the
world
you
talk
like
a
fool
sally
cried
the
sapient
waiter
do
you
see
that
his
dress
is
military
look
at
his
black
cap
with
its
long
bag
and
great
feather
and
the
monstrous
sword
at
his
side
look
at
them
and
then
if
you
can
say
i
am
mistaken
in
deciding
that
he
is
some
great
russian
commander
most
likely
come
over
as
ambassador
but
he
came
in
a
cried
a
little
dirty
boy
in
the
corner
as
i
was
running
up
stairs
with
colonel
leson
shoes
i
see
the
coachman
bring
in
his
portmanteau
well
what
of
that
cried
jenkins
is
a
nobleman
always
to
carry
his
equipage
about
him
like
a
snail
with
its
shell
on
its
back
to
be
sure
this
foreign
lord
or
prince
is
only
come
to
stay
here
till
his
own
house
is
fit
for
him
i
will
be
civil
to
him
and
so
will
i
jenkins
rejoined
sally
smiling
for
i
never
such
handsome
blue
eyes
in
my
born
days
and
they
turned
so
sweet
on
me
and
he
spoke
so
kindly
when
he
bade
me
stir
the
fire
and
when
he
sat
down
by
it
and
throwed
off
his
great
fur
cloak
i
see
a
glittering
star
on
his
breast
and
a
figure
so
noble
that
indeed
cook
i
do
verily
believe
he
is
as
jenkins
says
an
enthroned
king
you
and
jenkins
be
a
pair
of
fools
cried
the
cook
who
without
noticing
their
description
had
been
sulkily
basting
the
fowl
i
will
be
sworn
he
just
such
another
king
as
that
palavering
rogue
was
a
french
duke
who
got
my
master
watch
and
pawned
it
as
for
you
sally
you
had
better
beware
of
hunting
after
foreign
it
not
seemly
for
a
young
woman
and
you
may
chance
to
rue
it
the
moralizing
cook
had
now
brought
the
whole
kitchen
on
her
shoulders
the
men
abused
her
for
a
surly
old
maid
and
the
women
tittered
whilst
they
seconded
her
censure
by
cutting
sly
jokes
on
the
blushing
face
of
poor
sally
who
stood
almost
crying
by
the
side
of
her
champion
jenkins
whilst
this
hubbub
was
going
forward
below
stairs
its
unconscious
subject
was
as
sally
had
described
sitting
in
a
chair
close
to
the
fire
with
his
feet
on
the
fender
his
arms
folded
and
his
eyes
bent
on
the
flames
he
mused
but
his
ideas
followed
each
other
in
such
quick
confused
succession
it
hardly
could
be
said
he
thought
of
anything
the
entrance
of
dinner
roused
him
from
his
reverie
it
was
carried
in
by
at
least
half
a
dozen
waiters
the
count
had
been
so
accustomed
to
a
numerous
suite
of
attendants
he
did
not
observe
the
parcelling
out
of
his
temperate
meal
one
bringing
in
the
fowl
another
the
bread
his
neighbor
the
solitary
plate
and
the
rest
in
like
order
so
solicitous
were
the
male
listeners
in
the
kitchen
to
see
this
wonderful
russian
thaddeus
partook
but
lightly
of
the
refreshment
being
already
fatigued
in
body
and
dizzy
with
the
motion
of
the
vessel
as
soon
as
the
cloth
was
withdrawn
he
ordered
a
night
candle
and
desired
to
be
shown
to
his
chamber
jenkins
whom
the
sight
of
the
embroidered
star
confirmed
in
his
decision
that
the
foreigner
must
be
a
person
of
consequence
with
increased
agility
whipped
up
the
portmanteau
and
led
the
way
to
the
here
curiosity
put
on
a
new
form
the
women
servants
determined
to
have
their
wishes
gratified
as
well
as
the
men
had
arranged
themselves
on
each
side
of
the
passage
through
which
the
count
must
pass
at
so
strange
an
appearance
thaddeus
drew
back
but
supposing
that
it
might
be
a
custom
of
the
country
he
proceeded
through
this
fair
bevy
and
bowed
as
he
walked
along
to
the
low
curtesies
which
they
continued
to
make
until
he
entered
his
apartment
and
closed
the
door
the
unhappy
are
ever
restless
they
hope
in
every
change
of
situation
to
obtain
some
alteration
in
their
feelings
thaddeus
was
too
miserable
awake
not
to
view
with
eagerness
the
bed
on
which
he
trusted
that
for
a
few
hours
at
least
he
might
lose
the
consciousness
of
his
desolation
with
its
immediate
suffering
chapter
xii
thaddeus
first
day
in
england
when
he
awoke
in
the
morning
his
head
ached
and
he
felt
as
unrefreshed
as
when
he
had
lain
down
he
undrew
the
curtain
and
saw
from
the
strength
of
the
light
it
must
be
midday
he
got
up
and
having
dressed
himself
descended
to
the
where
he
found
a
good
fire
and
the
breakfast
already
placed
he
rang
the
bell
and
walked
to
the
window
to
observe
the
appearance
of
the
morning
a
heavy
snow
had
fallen
during
the
night
and
the
sun
ascended
to
its
meridian
shone
through
the
thick
atmosphere
like
a
ball
of
fire
all
seemed
comfortless
without
and
turning
back
to
the
warm
hearth
which
was
blazing
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
he
was
reseating
himself
when
jenkins
brought
in
the
i
hope
my
lord
said
the
waiter
that
your
lordship
slept
well
last
night
perfectly
i
thank
you
replied
the
count
unmindful
that
the
man
had
addressed
him
according
to
his
rank
when
you
come
to
remove
these
things
bring
me
my
bill
jenkins
bowed
and
withdrew
congratulating
himself
on
his
dexterity
in
having
saluted
the
stranger
with
his
title
during
the
absence
of
the
waiter
thaddeus
thought
it
time
to
examine
the
state
of
his
purse
he
well
recollected
how
he
had
paid
at
dantzic
and
from
the
style
in
which
he
was
served
here
he
did
not
doubt
that
to
defray
what
he
had
already
contracted
would
nearly
exhaust
his
all
he
emptied
the
contents
of
his
purse
into
his
hands
a
guinea
and
some
silver
was
all
that
he
possessed
a
flush
of
terror
suffused
itself
over
his
face
he
had
never
known
the
want
of
money
before
and
he
trembled
now
lest
the
charge
should
exceed
his
means
of
payment
jenkins
entered
with
the
bill
on
the
count
examining
it
he
was
pleased
to
find
it
amounted
to
no
more
than
the
only
piece
of
gold
his
purse
contained
he
laid
it
upon
the
and
putting
into
the
hand
of
jenkins
who
appeared
waiting
for
something
wrapped
his
cloak
round
him
as
he
was
walking
out
of
the
room
i
suppose
my
lord
cried
jenkins
pocketing
the
money
with
a
smirk
and
bowing
with
the
things
in
his
hands
we
are
to
have
the
honor
of
seeing
your
lordship
again
as
you
leave
your
portmanteau
behind
you
thaddeus
hesitated
a
few
seconds
then
again
moving
towards
the
door
said
i
will
send
for
it
by
what
name
my
lord
the
count
sobieski
jenkins
immediately
set
down
the
and
hurrying
after
thaddeus
along
the
passage
and
through
the
darted
before
him
and
opening
the
door
into
the
lobby
for
him
to
go
out
exclaimed
loud
enough
for
everybody
to
hear
depend
upon
it
count
sobieski
i
will
take
care
of
your
lordship
baggage
thaddeus
rather
displeased
at
his
noisy
officiousness
only
bent
his
head
and
proceeded
into
the
street
the
air
was
piercing
cold
and
on
his
looking
around
he
perceived
by
the
disposition
of
the
square
in
which
he
was
that
it
must
be
a
the
booths
and
stands
were
covered
with
snow
whilst
parts
of
the
pavement
were
rendered
nearly
impassable
by
heaps
of
black
ice
which
the
market
people
of
the
preceding
day
had
shoveled
up
out
of
their
way
he
recollected
it
was
now
sunday
and
consequently
the
improbability
of
finding
any
cheaper
lodgings
on
that
day
footnote
those
who
remember
the
terrible
winter
of
will
not
call
this
description
exaggerated
that
memorable
winter
was
one
of
mourning
to
many
in
england
some
of
her
own
brave
sons
perished
amidst
the
frozen
dykes
of
holland
and
the
netherlands
vainly
opposing
the
march
of
the
french
anarchists
how
strange
appeared
then
to
him
the
doom
of
nations
thaddeus
stood
under
the
piazzas
for
two
or
three
minutes
bewildered
on
the
plan
he
should
adopt
to
return
to
the
hotel
for
any
purpose
but
to
sleep
in
the
present
state
of
his
finances
would
be
impossible
he
therefore
determined
inclement
as
the
season
was
if
he
could
not
find
a
chapel
to
walk
the
streets
until
night
he
might
then
go
back
to
the
hummums
to
his
bed
chamber
but
he
resolved
to
quit
it
in
the
morning
for
a
residence
more
suitable
to
his
slender
means
the
wind
blew
keenly
from
the
accompanied
with
a
violent
shower
of
sleet
and
rain
yet
such
was
the
abstraction
of
his
mind
that
he
hardly
observed
its
bitterness
but
walked
on
careless
whither
his
feet
led
him
until
he
stopped
opposite
church
god
is
my
only
friend
and
in
any
house
of
his
i
shall
surely
find
shelter
he
turned
up
the
steps
and
was
entering
the
porch
when
he
met
the
congregation
thronging
out
of
it
is
the
service
over
he
inquired
of
a
decent
old
woman
who
was
passing
him
down
the
stairs
the
woman
started
at
this
question
asked
her
in
english
by
a
person
whose
dress
was
so
completely
foreign
he
repeated
it
smiling
and
curtseying
she
replied
yes
sir
and
i
am
sorry
for
it
lord
bless
your
handsome
face
though
you
be
a
stranger
gentleman
it
does
one
heart
good
to
see
you
so
devoutly
given
thaddeus
blushed
at
this
personal
compliment
though
it
came
from
the
lips
of
a
wrinkled
old
woman
and
begging
permission
to
assist
her
down
the
stairs
he
asked
when
service
would
begin
again
at
three
sir
and
may
heaven
bless
the
mother
who
bore
so
pious
a
son
while
the
poor
woman
spoke
she
raised
her
eyes
with
a
melancholy
resignation
the
count
touched
with
her
words
and
manner
almost
unconsciously
to
himself
continued
by
her
side
as
she
hobbled
down
the
street
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
until
somebody
pressing
against
him
made
him
look
round
he
saw
that
his
aged
companion
had
just
knocked
at
the
door
of
a
house
and
that
she
and
himself
were
surrounded
by
nearly
a
dozen
people
besides
boys
who
through
curiosity
had
followed
them
from
the
church
porch
ah
sweet
sir
cried
she
these
folks
are
staring
at
so
fine
a
gentleman
taking
notice
of
age
and
poverty
thaddeus
was
uneasy
at
the
inquisitive
gaze
of
the
bystanders
and
his
companion
observing
the
fluctuation
of
his
countenance
added
as
the
door
was
opened
by
a
little
girl
will
your
honor
walk
in
out
of
the
rain
and
warm
yourself
by
my
poor
fire
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
accepting
her
invitation
bent
his
head
to
get
under
the
humble
and
following
her
through
a
sanded
passage
entered
a
small
but
clean
kitchen
a
little
boy
who
was
sitting
on
a
stool
near
the
fire
uttered
a
scream
at
the
sight
of
the
stranger
and
running
up
to
his
grandmother
rolled
himself
in
her
cloak
crying
out
mammy
mammy
take
away
that
black
man
be
quiet
william
it
is
a
gentleman
and
no
black
man
i
am
so
ashamed
sir
but
he
is
only
three
years
old
i
should
apologize
to
you
returned
the
count
smiling
for
introducing
a
person
so
hideous
as
to
frighten
your
family
by
the
time
he
finished
speaking
the
good
dame
had
pacified
the
shrieking
boy
who
stood
trembling
and
looking
askance
at
the
tremendous
black
gentleman
stroking
the
head
of
his
pretty
sister
come
here
my
dear
said
thaddeus
seating
himself
by
the
fire
and
stretching
out
his
hand
to
the
child
he
instantly
buried
his
head
in
his
grandmother
apron
william
william
cried
his
sister
pulling
him
by
the
arm
the
gentleman
will
not
hurt
you
the
boy
again
lifted
up
his
head
thaddeus
threw
back
his
long
sable
cloak
and
taking
off
his
cap
whose
plumes
he
thought
might
have
terrified
the
child
he
laid
it
on
the
ground
and
again
stretching
forth
his
arms
called
the
boy
to
approach
him
little
william
now
looked
steadfastly
in
his
face
and
then
on
the
cap
which
he
had
laid
beside
him
whilst
he
grasped
his
apron
with
one
hand
he
held
out
the
other
half
assured
towards
the
count
thaddeus
took
it
and
pressing
it
softly
pulled
him
gently
to
him
and
placed
him
on
his
knee
my
little
fellow
said
he
kissing
him
you
are
not
frightened
now
no
said
the
child
i
see
you
are
not
the
ugly
black
man
who
takes
away
naughty
boys
the
ugly
black
man
has
a
black
face
and
snakes
on
his
head
but
these
are
pretty
curls
added
he
laughing
and
putting
his
little
fingers
through
the
thick
auburn
hair
which
hung
in
neglected
masses
over
the
forehead
of
the
count
i
am
ashamed
that
your
honor
should
sit
in
a
kitchen
said
the
old
lady
but
i
have
not
a
fire
in
any
other
room
yes
said
her
granddaughter
who
was
about
twelve
years
old
grandmother
has
a
nice
up
stairs
but
because
we
have
no
lodgers
there
be
no
fire
there
be
silent
nanny
robson
said
the
dame
your
pertness
teases
the
gentleman
o
not
at
all
cried
thaddeus
i
ought
to
thank
her
for
she
informs
me
you
have
lodgings
to
let
will
you
allow
me
to
engage
them
you
sir
cried
robson
thunderstruck
for
what
purpose
surely
so
noble
a
gentleman
would
not
live
in
such
a
place
as
this
i
would
robson
i
know
not
where
i
could
live
with
more
comfort
and
where
comfort
is
my
good
madam
what
signifies
the
costliness
or
plainness
of
the
dwelling
well
sir
if
you
be
indeed
serious
but
i
can
not
think
you
are
you
are
certainly
making
a
joke
of
me
for
my
boldness
in
asking
you
into
my
poor
house
upon
my
honor
i
am
not
robson
i
will
gladly
be
your
lodger
if
you
will
admit
me
and
to
convince
you
that
i
am
in
earnest
my
portmanteau
shall
this
moment
be
brought
here
well
sir
resumed
she
i
shall
be
honored
in
having
you
in
my
house
but
i
have
no
room
for
any
one
but
yourself
not
even
for
a
servant
i
have
no
servant
then
i
will
wait
on
him
grandmother
cried
the
little
nanny
do
let
the
gentleman
have
them
i
am
sure
he
looks
honest
the
woman
colored
at
this
last
observation
of
the
child
and
proceeded
then
sir
if
you
should
not
disdain
the
rooms
when
you
see
them
i
shall
be
too
happy
in
having
so
good
a
gentleman
under
my
roof
pardon
my
boldness
sir
but
may
i
ask
i
think
by
your
dress
you
are
a
foreigner
i
am
replied
thaddeus
the
radiance
which
played
over
his
features
contracting
into
a
glow
if
you
have
no
objection
to
take
a
stranger
within
your
doors
from
this
hour
i
shall
consider
your
house
my
home
as
your
honor
pleases
said
robson
my
terms
are
guinea
a
week
and
i
will
tend
on
you
as
though
you
were
my
own
son
for
i
can
not
forget
excellent
young
gentleman
the
way
in
which
we
first
met
then
i
will
leave
you
for
the
present
returned
he
rising
and
putting
down
the
little
william
who
had
been
amusing
himself
with
examining
the
silver
points
of
the
star
of
stanislaus
which
the
count
wore
on
his
breast
in
the
meanwhile
said
he
my
pretty
friend
stooping
to
the
child
let
this
bit
of
silver
was
just
mounting
to
his
tongue
as
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
to
take
out
but
he
recollected
that
his
necessities
would
no
longer
admit
of
such
gifts
and
drawing
his
hand
back
with
a
deep
and
bitter
sigh
he
touched
the
boy
cheek
with
his
lips
and
added
let
this
kiss
remind
you
of
your
new
friend
this
was
the
first
time
the
generous
spirit
of
sobieski
had
been
restrained
and
he
suffered
a
pang
for
the
poignancy
of
which
he
could
not
account
his
had
been
a
life
accustomed
to
acts
of
munificence
his
grandfather
palace
was
the
asylum
of
the
unhappy
his
grandfather
purse
a
treasury
for
the
unfortunate
the
soul
of
thaddeus
did
not
degenerate
from
his
noble
relative
his
generosity
begun
in
inclination
was
nurtured
by
reflection
and
strengthened
with
a
daily
exercise
which
had
rendered
it
a
habit
of
his
nature
want
never
appeared
before
him
without
exciting
a
sympathetic
emotion
in
his
heart
which
never
rested
until
he
had
administered
every
comfort
in
the
power
of
wealth
to
bestow
his
compassion
and
his
purse
were
the
substance
and
shadow
of
each
other
the
poor
of
his
country
thronged
from
every
part
of
the
kingdom
to
receive
pity
and
relief
at
his
hands
with
those
houseless
wanderers
he
peopled
the
new
villages
his
grandfather
had
erected
in
the
midst
of
lands
which
in
former
times
were
the
haunts
of
wild
beasts
thaddeus
participated
in
the
happiness
of
his
grateful
tenants
and
many
were
the
old
men
whose
eyes
he
had
closed
in
thankfulness
and
peace
these
honest
peasants
even
in
their
dying
moments
wished
to
give
up
that
life
in
his
arms
which
he
had
rescued
from
misery
he
visited
their
cottage
he
smoothed
their
pillow
he
joined
in
their
prayers
and
when
their
last
sigh
came
to
his
ear
he
raised
the
weeping
family
from
the
dust
and
cheered
them
with
pious
exhortations
and
his
kindest
assurances
of
protection
how
often
has
the
countess
clasped
her
beloved
son
to
her
breast
when
after
a
scene
like
this
he
has
returned
home
the
tears
of
the
dying
man
and
his
children
yet
wet
upon
his
hand
how
often
has
she
strained
him
to
her
heart
whilst
floods
of
rapture
have
poured
from
her
own
eyes
heir
to
the
first
fortune
in
poland
he
scarcely
knew
the
means
by
which
he
bestowed
all
these
benefits
and
with
a
soul
as
bounteous
to
others
as
heaven
had
been
munificent
to
him
wherever
he
moved
he
shed
smiles
and
gifts
around
him
how
frequently
he
had
said
to
the
palatine
when
his
were
chased
by
the
thankful
multitude
o
my
father
how
can
i
ever
be
sufficiently
grateful
to
god
for
the
happiness
he
hath
allotted
to
me
in
making
me
the
dispenser
of
so
many
blessings
the
gratitude
of
these
people
overpowers
and
humbles
me
in
my
own
eyes
what
have
i
done
to
be
so
eminently
favored
of
heaven
i
tremble
when
i
ask
myself
the
question
you
may
tremble
my
dear
boy
replied
his
grandfather
for
indeed
the
trial
is
a
severe
one
prosperity
like
adversity
is
an
ordeal
of
conduct
two
roads
are
before
the
rich
man
vanity
or
virtue
you
have
chosen
the
latter
and
the
best
and
may
heaven
ever
hold
you
in
it
may
heaven
ever
keep
your
heart
generous
and
pure
go
on
my
dear
thaddeus
as
you
have
commenced
and
you
will
find
that
your
creator
hath
bestowed
wealth
upon
you
not
for
what
you
have
done
but
as
the
means
of
evincing
how
well
you
would
prove
yourself
his
faithful
steward
this
the
fortune
of
thaddeus
and
he
who
had
scattered
thousands
without
counting
them
drew
back
his
hand
with
something
like
horror
at
his
own
injustice
when
he
was
going
to
give
away
one
little
piece
of
silver
which
he
might
want
in
a
day
or
two
to
defray
some
indispensible
debt
robson
said
he
as
he
replaced
his
cap
upon
his
head
i
shall
return
before
it
is
dark
very
well
sir
and
opening
the
door
he
went
out
into
the
lane
ignorant
of
the
town
and
thanking
providence
for
having
prepared
him
an
asylum
he
directed
his
course
towards
charing
cross
he
looked
about
him
with
deepened
sadness
the
wet
and
plashy
state
of
the
streets
gave
to
every
object
so
comfortless
an
appearance
he
could
scarcely
believe
himself
to
be
in
that
london
of
which
he
had
read
with
so
much
delight
where
were
the
magnificent
buildings
he
expected
to
see
in
the
emporium
of
the
world
where
that
cleanliness
and
those
tokens
of
greatness
and
splendor
which
had
been
the
admiration
and
boast
of
travellers
he
could
nowhere
discover
them
all
seemed
parts
of
a
dark
gloomy
city
hardly
heeding
whither
he
went
he
approached
the
a
view
of
the
park
as
it
appears
through
the
wide
porch
promised
him
less
unpleasantness
than
the
dirty
pavement
and
he
turned
in
taking
his
way
along
the
walk
footnote
the
young
readers
of
these
few
preceding
pages
will
not
recognize
this
description
of
martin
lane
charing
cross
and
james
park
in
in
what
they
now
see
there
in
martin
noble
church
was
then
the
centre
of
the
east
side
of
a
long
narrow
and
somewhat
dirty
lane
of
mean
houses
particularly
in
the
end
below
the
church
charing
cross
with
its
adjoining
streets
showed
nothing
better
than
plain
tradesmen
shops
and
it
was
not
till
we
saw
the
admiralty
and
entered
the
that
anything
presented
itself
worthy
the
great
name
of
london
the
park
is
almost
completely
altered
the
lower
part
of
the
lane
has
totally
disappeared
also
its
adjunct
the
king
mews
where
now
stands
the
royal
national
gallery
while
the
church
of
martin
rears
its
majestic
portico
and
spire
no
longer
obscured
by
its
former
adjacent
common
buildings
and
the
grand
naval
pillar
lately
erected
to
the
memory
of
britain
hero
nelson
occupies
the
centre
of
the
new
quadrangle
now
called
trafalgar
square
the
trees
stripped
of
their
leaves
stood
naked
and
dripping
with
melten
snow
the
season
was
in
unison
with
the
count
fate
he
was
taking
the
bitter
wind
for
his
repast
and
quenching
his
thirst
with
the
rain
that
fell
on
his
pale
and
feverish
lips
he
felt
the
cutting
blast
enter
his
soul
and
shutting
his
eyelids
to
repel
the
tears
which
were
rising
from
his
heart
he
walked
faster
but
in
spite
of
himself
their
drops
mingled
with
the
wet
that
trickled
from
his
cap
upon
his
face
one
melancholy
thought
introduced
another
until
his
bewildered
mind
lived
over
again
in
memory
every
calamity
which
had
reduced
him
from
happiness
to
all
this
lonely
misery
two
or
three
heavy
convulsive
sighs
followed
these
reflections
and
quickening
his
pace
he
walked
several
times
quite
round
the
park
the
rain
ceased
but
not
marking
time
and
hardly
observing
the
people
who
passed
he
threw
himself
down
upon
one
of
the
benches
and
sat
in
a
musing
posture
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
opposite
tree
a
sound
of
voices
approaching
roused
him
turning
his
eyes
he
saw
the
speakers
were
two
young
men
and
by
their
dress
he
judged
they
must
belong
to
the
regiment
of
a
sentinel
who
was
patrolling
at
the
end
of
the
mall
by
heavens
barrington
cried
one
it
is
the
best
shaped
boot
i
ever
beheld
i
have
a
good
mind
to
ask
him
whether
it
be
english
make
and
if
it
be
replied
the
other
you
must
ask
him
who
shaped
his
legs
that
you
may
send
yours
to
be
mended
who
the
devil
can
see
my
legs
through
that
boot
oh
if
to
veil
them
be
your
reason
pray
ask
him
immediately
and
so
i
will
for
i
think
the
boot
perfection
at
these
words
he
was
making
towards
sobieski
with
two
or
three
long
strides
when
his
companion
pulled
him
back
surely
harwold
you
will
not
be
so
ridiculous
he
appears
to
be
a
foreigner
of
rank
and
may
take
offence
and
give
you
the
length
of
his
foot
curse
him
and
rank
too
he
is
some
paltry
emigrant
i
warrant
i
care
nothing
about
his
foot
or
his
legs
but
i
should
like
to
know
who
made
his
boots
while
he
spoke
he
would
have
dragged
his
companion
along
with
him
but
barrington
broke
from
his
arm
and
the
fool
who
now
thought
himself
dared
to
it
strode
up
close
to
the
chair
and
bowed
to
thaddeus
who
hardly
crediting
that
he
could
be
the
subject
of
this
dialogue
returned
the
salutation
with
a
cold
bend
of
his
head
harwold
looked
a
little
confounded
at
this
haughty
demeanor
and
once
in
his
life
blushing
at
his
own
insolence
he
roared
out
as
if
in
defiance
of
shame
pray
sir
where
did
you
get
your
boots
where
i
got
my
sword
sir
replied
thaddeus
calmly
and
rising
from
his
seat
he
darted
his
eyes
disdainfully
on
the
coxcomb
and
walked
slowly
down
the
mall
surprised
and
shocked
at
such
behavior
in
a
british
officer
while
he
moved
away
he
distinctly
heard
barrington
laughing
aloud
and
ridiculing
the
astonished
and
air
of
his
impudent
associate
this
incident
did
not
so
much
ruffle
the
temper
of
thaddeus
as
it
amazed
and
perplexed
him
is
this
a
specimen
though
he
of
a
nation
which
on
the
continent
is
venerated
for
courage
manliness
and
generosity
well
i
find
i
have
much
to
learn
i
must
go
through
the
ills
of
life
to
estimate
myself
thoroughly
and
i
must
study
mankind
in
themselves
and
not
in
reports
of
them
to
have
a
true
knowledge
of
what
they
are
this
strange
rencontre
was
of
service
to
him
by
diverting
his
mind
from
the
intense
contemplation
of
his
situation
and
as
the
dusk
drew
on
he
turned
his
steps
towards
the
hummums
on
entering
the
he
was
met
by
the
obsequious
jenkins
who
being
told
by
thaddeus
that
he
wanted
his
baggage
and
a
carnage
went
for
the
things
himself
and
sent
a
boy
for
a
coach
a
man
dressed
in
black
was
standing
by
the
chimney
and
seemed
to
be
eyeing
thaddeus
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
great
attention
just
as
he
had
taken
another
turn
and
so
drew
nearer
the
fireplace
this
person
accosted
him
rather
abruptly
pray
sir
is
there
any
news
stirring
abroad
you
seem
sir
to
come
from
abroad
none
that
i
know
of
sir
bless
me
that
strange
i
thought
sir
you
came
from
abroad
sir
from
the
continent
from
poland
sir
at
least
the
waiter
said
so
sir
thaddeus
colored
the
waiter
sir
i
mean
sir
continued
the
gentleman
visibly
confused
at
the
dilemma
into
which
he
had
brought
himself
the
waiter
said
that
you
were
a
count
sir
a
polish
count
indeed
the
count
sobieski
hence
i
concluded
that
you
are
from
poland
if
i
have
offended
i
beg
pardon
sir
but
in
these
times
we
are
anxious
for
every
intelligence
thaddeus
made
no
other
reply
than
a
slight
inclination
of
his
head
and
walking
forward
to
see
whether
the
coach
had
arrived
he
thought
whatever
travellers
had
related
of
the
english
they
were
the
most
impertinent
people
he
had
ever
met
with
the
stranger
would
not
be
contented
with
what
he
had
already
said
but
plucking
up
new
courage
pursued
the
count
to
the
glass
door
through
which
he
was
looking
and
resumed
i
believe
sir
i
am
not
wrong
you
are
the
count
sobieski
and
i
have
the
honor
to
be
now
speaking
with
the
bravest
champion
of
polish
liberty
thaddeus
again
bowed
i
thank
you
sir
for
the
compliment
you
intend
me
but
i
can
not
take
it
to
myself
all
the
men
of
poland
old
and
young
nobles
and
peasants
were
her
champions
equally
sincere
equally
brave
nothing
could
silence
the
inquisitive
stranger
the
coach
drew
up
but
he
went
on
then
i
hope
that
many
of
these
patriots
besides
your
excellency
have
taken
care
to
bring
away
their
wealth
from
a
land
which
they
must
now
see
is
abandoned
to
destruction
for
a
moment
thaddeus
forget
himself
indignation
for
his
country
and
all
her
rights
and
all
her
sufferings
rose
in
his
countenance
no
sir
not
one
of
those
men
and
least
of
all
would
i
have
drawn
one
vital
drop
from
her
heart
i
left
in
her
murdered
bosom
all
that
was
dear
to
me
all
that
i
possessed
and
not
until
i
saw
the
chains
brought
before
my
eyes
that
were
to
lay
her
surviving
sons
in
irons
did
i
turn
my
back
on
calamities
i
could
no
longer
avert
or
alleviate
the
ardor
of
his
manner
and
the
elevation
of
his
voice
had
drawn
the
attention
of
every
person
in
the
room
upon
him
when
jenkins
entered
with
his
baggage
the
door
being
opened
sobieski
sprang
into
the
coach
and
gladly
shut
himself
there
from
a
conversation
which
had
awakened
all
his
griefs
ah
poor
enthusiast
exclaimed
his
inquisitor
as
the
carriage
drove
off
it
is
a
pity
that
so
fine
a
young
man
should
have
made
so
ill
a
use
of
his
birth
and
other
natural
advantages
he
appears
to
me
observed
an
old
clergyman
who
sat
in
an
adjoining
box
to
have
made
the
best
possible
use
of
his
natural
advantages
and
had
i
a
son
i
would
rather
hear
him
utter
such
a
sentiment
as
the
one
with
which
that
young
man
quitted
the
room
than
see
him
master
of
millions
may
be
so
cried
the
questioner
with
a
contemptuous
glance
minds
incline
to
different
objects
his
has
decided
for
wonderful
the
wild
and
a
pretty
finale
he
has
made
of
his
choice
why
to
be
sure
observed
another
spectator
young
people
should
be
brought
up
with
reasonable
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
and
prudence
nevertheless
i
should
not
like
a
son
of
mine
to
run
through
my
property
and
his
own
life
and
yet
one
can
not
help
when
one
hears
such
a
brave
speech
as
that
from
yonder
frenchman
just
gone
out
i
say
one
can
not
help
thinking
it
very
fine
true
true
cried
the
inquisitor
you
are
right
sir
very
fine
indeed
but
too
fine
to
wear
it
would
soon
leave
us
acreless
as
it
has
done
him
for
it
seems
by
his
own
confession
he
is
penniless
and
i
know
that
a
twelvemonth
ago
he
was
an
heir
to
a
fortune
which
however
incalculable
he
has
managed
with
all
his
talents
to
see
the
end
of
then
he
is
in
distress
exclaimed
the
clergyman
and
you
know
him
what
is
his
name
the
man
colored
at
this
unexpected
inference
and
glad
the
company
had
not
attended
to
that
part
of
the
dialogue
in
which
the
name
of
sobieski
was
mentioned
he
stammered
some
indistinct
words
took
up
his
hat
and
looking
at
his
watch
begged
pardon
having
an
appointment
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
without
speaking
further
although
the
good
clergyman
whose
name
was
blackmore
hastened
after
him
requesting
to
know
where
the
young
foreigner
lived
who
is
that
spectacled
coxcomb
cried
the
reverend
doctor
as
he
returned
from
his
unavailing
application
i
do
know
sir
replied
the
waiter
i
never
saw
him
in
this
house
before
last
night
when
he
came
in
late
to
sleep
and
this
morning
he
was
in
the
at
breakfast
just
as
that
foreign
gentleman
walked
through
and
jenkins
bawling
his
name
out
very
loud
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
this
here
gentleman
asked
him
who
that
count
was
i
heard
jenkins
say
some
russian
name
and
tell
him
he
came
last
night
and
would
likely
come
back
again
and
so
that
there
gentleman
has
been
loitering
about
all
day
till
now
when
the
foreign
gentleman
coming
in
he
spoke
to
him
and
do
you
know
anything
further
of
this
foreigner
no
sir
i
forget
what
he
is
called
but
i
see
jenkins
going
across
the
street
shall
i
run
after
him
and
ask
him
you
are
very
obliging
returned
the
old
clergyman
but
does
jenkins
know
where
the
stranger
lives
no
sir
i
am
sure
he
do
i
am
sorry
for
it
sighed
the
kind
questioner
then
your
inquiry
would
be
of
no
use
his
name
will
not
do
without
his
direction
poor
fellow
he
has
been
unfortunate
and
i
might
have
befriended
him
yes
to
be
sure
doctor
cried
the
first
speaker
who
now
rose
to
accompany
him
out
it
is
our
duty
to
befriend
the
unfortunate
but
charity
begins
at
home
and
as
all
for
the
best
perhaps
it
is
lucky
we
did
not
hear
any
more
about
this
young
fellow
we
might
have
involved
ourselves
in
a
vast
deal
of
unnecessary
trouble
and
you
know
people
from
outlandish
parts
have
no
claims
upon
us
certainly
replied
the
doctor
none
in
the
world
excepting
those
which
no
human
creature
can
dispute
the
claims
of
nature
all
mankind
are
born
heirs
of
suffering
and
as
joint
inheritors
if
we
do
not
wipe
away
each
other
tears
it
will
prove
but
a
comfortless
portion
ah
doctor
cried
his
companion
as
they
separated
at
the
end
of
you
have
always
the
best
of
an
argument
you
have
logic
and
aristotle
at
your
finger
ends
no
my
friend
my
arguments
are
purely
christian
nature
is
my
logic
and
the
bible
my
teacher
ah
there
you
have
me
again
you
parsons
are
as
bad
as
the
lawyers
when
once
you
get
a
poor
sinner
amongst
you
he
finds
it
as
hard
to
get
out
of
the
church
as
out
of
chancery
however
have
it
your
own
way
charity
is
your
trade
and
i
wo
be
in
a
hurry
to
dispute
the
monopoly
if
i
stay
much
longer
you
will
make
me
believe
that
black
is
white
blackmore
shook
him
by
the
hand
and
wishing
him
returned
home
pitying
the
worldliness
of
his
friend
mind
and
musing
on
the
interesting
stranger
whom
he
could
not
but
admire
and
compassionate
with
a
lively
sorrow
for
he
believed
him
to
be
a
gentleman
unhappy
and
unfortunate
had
he
known
that
the
object
of
his
solicitude
was
the
illustrious
subject
of
many
a
former
eulogium
from
himself
how
increased
would
have
been
his
regret
that
he
had
seen
count
thaddeus
sobieski
that
he
had
seen
him
an
exile
and
that
he
had
suffered
him
to
pass
out
of
the
reach
of
his
services
chapter
xiii
the
exile
lodgings
meanwhile
the
homeless
sobieski
was
cordially
received
by
his
humble
landlady
he
certainly
never
stood
in
more
need
of
kindness
a
slow
fever
which
had
been
gradually
creeping
over
him
since
he
quitted
poland
soon
settled
on
his
nerves
and
reduced
him
to
such
weakness
that
he
possessed
neither
strength
nor
spirits
to
stir
abroad
robson
was
sincerely
grieved
at
this
illness
of
her
guest
her
own
son
the
father
of
the
orphans
she
protected
had
died
of
consumption
and
any
appearance
of
that
cruel
disorder
was
a
certain
call
upon
her
compassion
thaddeus
gave
himself
up
to
her
management
he
had
no
money
for
medical
assistance
and
to
please
her
he
took
what
little
medicines
she
prepared
according
to
her
advice
he
remained
for
several
days
shut
up
in
his
chamber
with
a
large
fire
and
the
shutters
closed
to
exclude
the
smallest
portion
of
that
air
which
the
good
woman
thought
had
already
stricken
him
with
death
but
all
would
not
do
her
patient
became
worse
and
worse
frightened
at
the
symptoms
robson
begged
leave
to
send
for
the
kind
apothecary
who
had
attended
her
deceased
son
in
this
instance
only
she
found
the
count
obstinate
no
arguments
nor
even
tears
could
move
him
to
assent
when
she
stood
weeping
and
holding
his
burning
hand
his
answer
was
constantly
the
same
my
excellent
robson
do
not
grieve
on
my
account
i
am
not
in
the
danger
you
think
i
shall
do
very
well
with
your
assistance
no
no
i
see
death
in
your
eyes
can
i
feel
this
hand
and
see
that
hectic
cheek
without
beholding
your
grave
as
it
were
opening
before
me
she
was
not
much
mistaken
for
during
the
night
after
this
debate
thaddeus
grew
so
delirious
that
no
longer
able
to
subdue
her
terrors
she
sent
for
the
apothecary
to
come
instantly
to
her
house
oh
doctor
cried
she
while
he
ascended
the
stairs
i
have
the
best
young
gentleman
ever
the
sun
shone
on
dying
in
that
room
he
would
not
let
me
send
for
you
and
now
he
is
raving
like
a
mad
creature
vincent
entered
the
count
humble
apartment
and
undrew
the
curtains
of
the
bed
exhausted
by
delirium
thaddeus
had
sunk
senseless
on
his
pillow
at
this
sight
supposing
him
dead
robson
uttered
a
shriek
which
was
echoed
by
the
cries
of
the
little
william
who
stood
near
his
grandmother
hush
my
good
woman
said
the
doctor
the
gentleman
is
not
dead
leave
the
room
till
you
have
recovered
yourself
and
i
will
engage
that
you
shall
see
him
alive
when
you
return
blessing
these
words
she
quitted
the
room
with
her
grandson
on
entering
the
chamber
vincent
had
felt
that
its
hot
and
stifling
atmosphere
must
augment
the
fever
of
his
patient
and
before
he
attempted
to
disturb
him
from
the
temporary
rest
of
insensibility
he
opened
the
and
also
the
wide
enough
to
admit
the
air
from
the
adjoining
apartment
pulling
the
heavy
clothes
from
the
count
bosom
he
raised
his
head
on
his
arm
and
poured
some
drops
into
his
mouth
sobieski
opened
his
eyes
and
uttered
a
few
incoherent
words
but
he
did
not
rave
he
only
wandered
and
appeared
to
know
that
he
did
so
for
he
several
times
stopped
in
the
midst
of
some
confused
speech
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
forehead
strove
to
recollect
himself
robson
soon
after
the
room
and
wept
out
her
thanks
to
the
apothecary
whom
she
revered
as
almost
a
worker
of
miracles
i
must
bleed
him
robson
continued
he
and
for
that
purpose
shall
go
home
for
my
assistant
and
lancets
but
in
the
meanwhile
i
charge
you
to
let
every
thing
remain
in
the
state
i
have
left
it
the
heat
alone
would
have
given
a
fever
to
a
man
in
health
when
the
apothecary
returned
he
saw
that
his
commands
had
been
strictly
obeyed
and
finding
that
the
change
of
atmosphere
had
wrought
the
expected
alteration
in
his
patient
he
took
his
arm
without
difficulty
and
bled
him
at
the
end
of
the
operation
thaddeus
again
fainted
poor
gentleman
cried
vincent
binding
up
the
arm
look
here
tom
pointing
to
the
scars
on
the
count
shoulder
and
breast
see
what
terrible
cuts
have
been
here
this
has
not
been
playing
at
soldiers
who
is
your
lodger
mrs
robson
his
name
is
constantine
vincent
but
for
heaven
sake
recover
him
from
that
swoon
vincent
poured
more
drops
into
his
mouth
and
a
minute
afterwards
he
opened
his
eyes
divested
of
their
feverish
glare
but
still
dull
and
heavy
he
spoke
to
robson
by
her
name
which
gave
her
such
delight
that
she
caught
his
hands
to
her
lips
and
burst
again
into
tears
the
action
was
so
abrupt
and
violent
that
it
made
him
feel
the
stiffness
of
his
arm
casting
his
eyes
towards
the
surgeon
he
conjectured
what
had
been
his
state
and
what
the
consequence
come
robson
said
the
apothecary
you
must
not
disturb
the
gentleman
how
do
you
find
yourself
sir
as
the
deed
could
not
be
recalled
thaddeus
thanked
the
doctor
for
the
service
he
had
received
and
said
a
few
kind
and
grateful
words
to
his
good
hostess
vincent
was
glad
to
see
so
promising
an
issue
to
his
proceedings
and
soon
after
retired
with
his
assistant
and
robson
to
give
further
directions
on
entering
the
parlor
she
threw
herself
into
a
chair
and
broke
into
a
paroxysm
of
lamentations
my
good
woman
what
is
all
this
about
inquired
the
doctor
is
not
my
patient
better
yes
cried
she
drying
her
eyes
but
the
whole
scene
puts
me
so
in
mind
of
the
last
moments
of
my
poor
misguided
son
that
the
very
sight
of
it
goes
through
my
heart
like
a
knife
oh
had
my
boy
been
as
good
as
that
dear
gentleman
had
he
been
as
well
prepared
to
die
i
think
i
would
scarcely
have
grieved
yet
heaven
spare
constantine
will
he
live
i
hope
so
robson
his
fever
is
high
but
he
is
young
and
with
extreme
care
we
may
preserve
him
the
lord
grant
it
cried
she
for
he
is
the
best
gentleman
i
ever
beheld
he
has
been
above
a
week
with
me
and
till
this
night
in
which
he
lost
his
senses
though
hardly
able
to
breath
or
see
he
has
read
out
of
books
which
he
brought
with
him
and
good
books
too
for
it
was
but
yesterday
morning
that
i
saw
the
dear
soul
sitting
by
the
fire
with
a
book
on
the
table
which
he
had
been
studying
for
an
hour
as
i
was
dusting
about
i
saw
him
lay
his
head
down
on
it
and
put
his
hand
to
his
temples
sir
said
i
tease
your
brains
with
these
books
of
learning
when
you
ought
to
be
taking
rest
no
robson
returned
he
with
a
sweet
smile
is
this
book
which
brings
me
rest
i
may
amuse
myself
with
others
but
this
alone
contains
perfect
beauty
perfect
wisdom
and
perfect
peace
it
is
the
only
infallible
soother
of
human
sorrows
he
closed
it
and
put
it
on
the
and
when
i
looked
at
it
afterwards
i
found
it
was
the
bible
can
you
wonder
that
i
should
love
so
excellent
a
gentleman
you
have
given
a
strange
account
of
him
replied
vincent
i
hope
he
is
not
a
twaddler
footnote
a
term
of
derision
forty
years
ago
amongst
unthinking
persons
when
speaking
of
eminently
religious
people
if
so
i
shall
despair
of
his
cure
and
think
his
delirium
had
another
cause
besides
fever
i
do
understand
you
sir
he
is
a
christian
and
as
good
a
reasonable
gentleman
as
ever
came
into
a
house
alas
i
believe
he
is
most
likely
a
papist
though
they
say
papists
read
the
bible
but
worship
images
why
what
reason
have
you
to
suppose
that
he
an
englishman
is
he
not
no
he
is
an
emigrant
an
emigrant
oh
ho
cried
vincent
with
a
contemptuous
twirl
of
his
lip
what
a
poor
frenchman
good
lord
how
this
town
is
overrun
with
these
fellows
no
doctor
exclaimed
robson
greatly
hurt
at
this
scorn
to
her
lodger
whom
she
really
loved
whatever
he
be
he
is
not
poor
for
he
has
a
power
of
fine
things
he
has
got
a
watch
all
over
diamonds
and
diamond
rings
and
diamond
pictures
without
number
so
doctor
you
need
not
fear
you
are
attending
him
for
charity
no
i
would
sell
my
gown
first
nay
do
be
offended
robson
i
meant
no
offence
returned
he
much
mollified
by
this
explanation
but
really
when
we
see
the
bread
that
should
feed
our
children
and
our
own
poor
eaten
up
by
a
parcel
of
lazy
french
drones
all
the
democratic
rabble
were
commonly
so
called
at
that
early
period
of
the
french
revolution
and
certainly
some
of
their
demagogues
did
cross
the
channel
at
times
counterfeiting
themselves
to
be
loyal
emigrants
while
assiduously
disseminating
their
destructive
principles
wherever
they
could
find
an
entrance
in
disguise
for
aught
we
know
who
cover
our
land
and
destroy
its
produce
like
a
swarm
of
filthy
locusts
we
should
be
fools
not
to
murmur
but
what
do
you
call
him
robson
is
a
different
sort
of
body
constantine
replied
she
and
indeed
he
is
and
no
doubt
when
you
recover
him
he
will
pay
you
as
though
he
were
in
his
own
country
this
last
assertion
banished
all
remaining
suspicion
from
the
mind
of
the
apothecary
and
after
giving
the
good
woman
what
orders
he
thought
requisite
he
returned
home
promising
to
call
again
in
the
evening
robson
went
up
stairs
to
the
count
chamber
with
other
sentiments
to
her
sapient
doctor
than
those
with
which
she
came
down
she
well
recollected
the
substance
of
his
discourse
and
she
gathered
from
it
that
however
clever
he
might
be
in
his
profession
he
was
a
man
who
would
rather
see
a
perish
than
administer
relief
to
him
without
a
reward
she
had
paid
him
to
the
uttermost
farthing
for
her
poor
son
but
here
robson
was
mistaken
she
did
him
justice
in
esteeming
his
medical
abilities
which
were
great
he
had
made
medicine
the
study
of
his
life
and
not
allowing
any
other
occupation
to
disturb
his
attention
he
became
master
of
that
science
but
remained
ignorant
of
every
other
with
which
it
had
no
connection
he
was
the
father
of
a
family
and
in
the
usual
acceptation
of
the
term
a
very
good
sort
of
a
man
he
preferred
his
country
to
every
other
because
it
was
his
country
he
loved
his
wife
and
his
children
he
was
kind
to
the
poor
to
whom
he
gave
his
advice
gratis
and
letters
to
the
dispensary
for
drugs
and
when
he
had
any
broken
victuals
to
spare
he
desired
that
they
might
be
divided
amongst
them
but
he
seldom
caught
his
maid
obeying
this
part
of
his
commands
without
reprimanding
her
for
her
extravagance
in
giving
away
what
ought
to
be
eaten
in
the
kitchen
in
these
times
it
was
a
shame
to
waste
a
crumb
and
the
careless
hussy
would
come
to
want
for
thinking
so
lightly
of
other
people
property
thus
like
many
in
the
world
he
was
a
loyal
citizen
by
habit
an
affectionate
father
from
nature
and
a
man
of
charity
because
he
now
and
then
felt
pity
and
now
and
then
heard
it
preached
from
the
pulpit
he
was
exhorted
to
be
pious
and
to
pour
wine
and
oil
into
the
wounds
of
his
neighbor
but
it
never
once
struck
him
that
piety
extended
further
than
going
to
church
mumbling
his
prayers
and
forgetting
the
sermon
through
most
of
which
he
generally
slept
and
his
commentaries
on
the
good
samaritan
were
not
more
extensive
for
it
was
so
difficult
to
make
him
comprehend
who
was
his
neighbor
that
the
subject
of
the
argument
might
have
been
sick
dead
and
buried
before
he
could
be
persuaded
that
he
or
she
had
any
claims
on
his
care
indeed
his
chanty
began
at
home
and
it
was
so
fond
of
its
residence
that
it
stopped
there
to
have
been
born
on
the
other
side
of
the
british
channel
spread
an
ocean
between
every
poor
foreigner
and
vincent
purse
which
the
swiftest
wings
of
chanty
could
never
cross
he
saw
no
reason
he
said
for
feeding
the
natural
enemies
of
our
country
would
any
man
be
mad
enough
to
take
the
meat
from
his
children
mouths
and
throw
it
to
a
swarm
of
wolves
just
landed
on
the
coast
these
wolves
were
his
favorite
metaphor
when
he
spoke
of
the
unhappy
french
or
of
any
other
penniless
strangers
that
came
in
his
way
after
this
explanation
it
may
appear
paradoxical
to
mention
an
inconsistency
in
the
mind
of
vincent
which
never
permitted
him
to
discover
the
above
cainish
mark
of
outlawry
upon
a
wealthy
visitor
of
whatever
country
in
fact
it
was
with
him
as
with
many
riches
were
a
splendid
and
thick
robe
that
concealed
all
blemishes
take
it
away
and
probably
the
poor
stripped
wretch
would
be
treated
worse
than
a
criminal
that
his
new
patient
possessed
some
property
was
sufficient
to
ensure
the
respect
and
medical
skill
of
vincent
and
when
he
entered
his
own
house
he
told
his
wife
he
had
found
a
very
good
job
at
robson
in
the
illness
of
her
lodger
a
foreigner
of
some
sort
he
said
who
by
her
account
had
feathered
his
nest
well
in
the
spoils
of
battle
like
moore
honest
irishman
with
jewels
and
gold
so
much
for
the
accuracy
of
most
quotations
adopted
according
to
the
convenience
of
the
speaker
when
the
count
sobieski
quitted
the
hummums
on
the
evening
in
which
he
brought
away
his
baggage
he
was
so
disconcerted
by
the
impertinence
of
the
man
who
accosted
him
there
that
he
determined
not
to
expose
himself
to
a
similar
insult
by
retaining
a
title
which
might
subject
him
to
the
curiosity
of
the
insolent
and
insensible
and
therefore
when
robson
asked
him
how
she
should
address
him
as
he
was
averse
to
assume
a
feigned
name
he
merely
said
constantine
under
that
unobtrusive
character
he
hoped
in
time
to
accommodate
his
feelings
to
the
change
of
fortune
which
providence
had
allotted
to
him
he
must
forget
his
nobility
his
pride
and
his
sensibility
he
must
earn
his
subsistence
but
by
what
means
he
was
ignorant
of
business
and
he
knew
not
how
to
turn
his
accomplishments
to
account
such
were
his
meditations
until
illness
and
delirium
deprived
him
of
them
and
of
reason
together
at
the
expiration
of
a
week
in
which
vincent
attended
his
patient
very
regularly
sobieski
was
able
to
remove
into
the
front
room
but
uneasiness
about
the
debts
he
had
so
unintentionally
incurred
retarded
his
recovery
and
made
his
hours
pass
away
in
cheerless
musings
on
his
poor
means
of
repaying
the
good
widow
and
of
satisfying
the
avidity
of
the
apothecary
pecuniary
obligation
was
a
load
to
which
he
was
unaccustomed
and
once
or
twice
the
wish
almost
escaped
his
heart
that
he
had
died
whenever
he
was
left
to
think
such
were
his
reflections
robson
discovered
that
he
appeared
more
feverish
and
had
worse
nights
after
being
much
alone
during
the
day
and
therefore
contrived
though
she
was
obliged
to
be
in
her
little
shop
to
leave
either
nanny
to
attend
his
wants
or
little
william
to
amuse
him
this
child
by
its
uncommon
quickness
and
artless
manner
gained
upon
the
count
who
was
ever
alive
to
helplessness
and
innocence
children
and
animals
had
always
found
a
friend
and
protector
in
him
from
the
majestic
with
his
neck
clothed
in
thunder
to
the
poor
beetle
that
we
tread
upon
every
creature
of
creation
met
an
advocate
of
mercy
in
his
breast
and
as
human
nature
is
prone
to
love
what
it
has
been
kind
to
thaddeus
never
saw
either
children
dogs
or
even
that
poor
slandered
and
abused
animal
the
cat
without
showing
them
some
spontaneous
act
of
attention
whatever
of
his
affections
he
could
spare
from
memory
the
count
lavished
upon
the
little
william
the
child
hardly
ever
left
his
side
where
he
sat
on
a
stool
prattling
about
anything
that
came
into
his
head
or
seated
on
his
knee
followed
with
his
eyes
and
playful
fingers
the
hand
of
thaddeus
while
he
sketched
a
horse
or
a
soldier
for
his
pretty
companion
chapter
xiv
a
robbery
and
its
consequences
by
these
means
thaddeus
slowly
acquired
sufficient
strength
to
allow
him
to
quit
his
and
prepare
for
a
walk
a
hard
frost
had
succeeded
to
the
chilling
damps
of
november
and
looking
out
of
the
window
he
longed
almost
eagerly
to
inhale
again
the
fresh
air
after
some
tender
altercations
with
robson
who
feared
to
trust
him
even
down
stairs
he
at
length
conquered
and
taking
the
little
william
by
his
hand
folded
his
pelisse
round
him
and
promising
to
venture
no
further
than
the
king
mews
was
suffered
to
go
out
as
he
expected
he
found
the
keen
breeze
act
like
a
charm
on
his
debilitated
frame
and
with
braced
nerves
and
exhilarated
spirits
he
walked
twice
up
and
down
the
place
whilst
his
companion
played
before
him
throwing
stones
and
running
to
pick
them
up
at
this
moment
one
of
the
king
carriages
pursued
by
a
concourse
of
people
suddenly
drove
in
at
the
gate
the
frightened
child
screamed
and
fell
thaddeus
darted
forward
and
seizing
the
heads
of
the
horses
which
were
within
a
yard
of
the
boy
stopped
them
meanwhile
the
mob
gathering
about
one
of
them
raised
william
who
continued
his
cries
the
count
now
let
go
the
reins
and
for
a
few
minutes
tried
to
pacify
his
little
charge
but
finding
that
his
alarm
and
shrieks
were
not
to
be
quelled
and
that
his
own
figure
from
its
singularity
of
dress
his
high
cap
and
plume
adding
to
its
height
drew
on
him
the
whole
attention
of
the
people
he
took
the
trembling
child
in
his
arms
and
walking
through
the
mews
was
followed
by
some
of
the
bystanders
to
the
very
door
of
robson
shop
seeing
the
people
and
her
grandson
sobbing
on
the
breast
of
her
guest
she
ran
out
and
hastily
asked
what
had
happened
thaddeus
simply
answered
that
the
child
had
been
frightened
but
when
they
entered
the
house
and
he
had
thrown
himself
exhausted
on
a
seat
william
as
he
stood
by
his
knee
told
his
grandmother
that
if
constantine
had
not
stopped
the
horses
he
must
have
been
run
over
the
count
was
now
obliged
to
relate
the
whole
story
which
ended
with
the
blessings
of
the
poor
woman
for
his
goodness
in
risking
his
own
life
for
the
preservation
of
her
darling
child
thaddeus
in
vain
assured
her
the
action
deserved
no
thanks
well
cried
she
it
is
like
yourself
constantine
you
think
all
your
good
deeds
nothing
and
yet
any
odd
little
thing
i
can
do
out
of
pure
love
to
serve
you
you
cry
up
to
the
skies
however
we
wo
fall
out
i
say
heaven
bless
you
and
that
is
enough
has
your
walk
refreshed
you
but
i
need
not
ask
you
have
got
a
fine
color
yes
returned
he
rising
and
taking
off
his
cap
and
cloak
it
has
put
me
in
aglow
and
made
me
quite
another
creature
as
he
finished
speaking
he
dropped
the
things
from
the
hand
that
held
them
and
staggered
back
a
few
paces
against
the
wall
good
lord
what
is
the
matter
cried
robson
looking
in
his
face
which
was
now
pale
as
death
what
is
the
matter
nothing
nothing
returned
he
recovering
himself
and
gathering
up
the
cloak
he
had
let
fall
do
mind
me
robson
nothing
and
he
was
leaving
the
kitchen
but
she
followed
him
terrified
at
his
look
and
manner
pray
mr
constantine
nay
my
dear
madam
said
he
leading
her
back
i
am
not
well
i
believe
my
walk
has
overcome
me
let
me
be
a
few
minutes
alone
till
i
have
recovered
myself
it
will
oblige
me
well
sir
as
you
please
and
then
laying
her
withered
hand
fearfully
upon
his
arm
forgive
me
dear
sir
said
she
if
my
attentions
are
troublesome
indeed
i
fear
that
sometimes
great
love
appears
like
great
impertinence
i
would
always
be
serving
you
and
therefore
i
often
forget
the
wide
difference
between
your
station
and
mine
the
count
could
only
press
her
hand
gratefully
and
with
an
emotion
which
made
him
hurry
up
stairs
to
hide
when
in
his
own
room
he
shut
the
door
and
cast
a
wild
and
inquisitive
gaze
around
the
apartment
then
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
he
struck
his
head
with
his
hand
and
exclaimed
it
is
gone
what
will
become
of
me
of
this
poor
woman
whose
substance
i
have
consumed
it
was
true
the
watch
by
the
sale
of
which
he
had
calculated
to
defray
the
charges
of
his
illness
was
indeed
lost
a
villain
in
the
crowd
having
perceived
the
sparkling
of
the
chain
had
taken
it
unobserved
from
his
side
and
he
knew
nothing
of
his
loss
until
feeling
for
his
watch
to
see
the
hour
he
discovered
his
misfortune
the
shock
went
like
a
stroke
of
electricity
through
his
frame
but
it
was
not
until
the
last
glimmering
of
hope
was
extinguished
on
examining
his
room
where
he
thought
he
might
have
left
it
that
he
saw
the
full
horror
of
his
situation
he
sat
for
some
minutes
absorbed
and
almost
afraid
to
think
it
was
not
his
own
but
the
necessities
of
the
poor
woman
who
had
perhaps
incurred
debts
on
herself
to
afford
him
comforts
which
bore
so
hard
upon
him
at
last
rising
from
his
seat
he
exclaimed
i
must
determine
on
something
since
this
is
gone
i
must
seek
what
else
i
have
to
part
with
for
i
can
not
long
bear
my
present
feelings
he
opened
the
drawer
which
contained
his
few
valuables
with
a
trembling
hand
he
took
them
out
one
by
one
there
were
several
trinkets
which
had
been
given
to
him
by
his
mother
and
a
pair
of
inlaid
pistols
which
his
grandfather
put
into
his
belt
on
the
morning
of
the
dreadful
of
october
his
miniature
lay
beneath
them
the
mild
eyes
of
the
palatine
seemed
beaming
with
affection
upon
his
grandson
thaddeus
snatched
it
up
kissed
it
fervently
and
then
laid
it
back
into
the
drawer
whilst
he
hid
his
face
with
his
hands
when
he
recovered
himself
he
replaced
the
pistols
believing
that
it
would
be
sacrilege
to
part
with
them
without
allowing
himself
time
to
think
he
put
a
gold
and
a
pair
of
brilliant
buttons
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
he
descended
the
stairs
with
a
soft
step
and
passing
the
door
unperceived
by
his
landlady
crossed
through
a
little
court
and
then
anxiously
looking
from
right
to
left
in
quest
of
some
shop
where
he
might
probably
dispose
of
the
trinkets
he
took
his
way
up
castle
street
and
along
leicester
square
when
he
turned
up
the
first
street
to
his
right
he
was
impeded
by
two
persons
who
stood
in
his
path
the
one
selling
the
other
buying
a
hat
the
thought
immediately
struck
thaddeus
to
ask
one
of
these
men
who
appeared
to
be
a
jew
and
a
vender
of
clothes
to
purchase
his
pelisse
by
parting
with
a
thing
to
which
he
annexed
no
more
value
than
the
warmth
it
afforded
him
he
should
possibly
spare
himself
the
pain
for
this
time
at
least
of
sacrificing
those
gifts
of
his
mother
which
had
been
bestowed
upon
him
in
happier
days
and
hallowed
by
her
caresses
he
did
not
permit
himself
to
hesitate
but
desired
the
jew
to
follow
him
into
a
neighboring
court
the
man
obeyed
and
having
no
ideas
independent
of
his
trade
asked
the
count
what
he
wanted
to
buy
nothing
i
want
to
sell
this
pelisse
returned
he
opening
it
the
jew
without
any
ceremony
inspected
its
covering
and
its
lining
of
fur
ay
i
see
black
cloth
and
sable
but
who
would
buy
it
of
me
an
embroidered
collar
nobody
wears
such
things
here
then
i
am
answered
replied
thaddeus
stop
sir
cried
the
jew
pursuing
him
what
will
you
take
for
it
what
would
you
give
me
let
me
see
it
is
very
long
and
wide
at
the
utmost
i
can
not
offer
you
more
than
five
guineas
a
few
months
ago
it
had
cost
the
count
a
hundred
but
glad
to
get
any
money
however
small
he
readily
closed
with
the
man
price
and
taking
off
the
cloak
gave
it
to
him
and
put
the
guineas
into
his
pocket
he
had
not
walked
much
further
before
the
piercing
cold
of
the
evening
and
a
shower
of
snow
which
began
to
fall
made
him
feel
the
effects
of
his
loss
however
that
did
not
annoy
him
he
had
been
too
heavily
assailed
by
the
pitiless
rigors
of
misfortune
to
regard
the
pelting
of
the
elements
whilst
the
wind
blew
in
his
face
and
the
sleet
falling
on
his
dress
lodged
in
its
lappels
he
went
forward
calculating
whether
it
were
likely
that
this
money
with
the
few
shillings
he
yet
possessed
would
be
sufficient
to
discharge
what
he
owed
unused
as
he
had
been
to
all
kinds
of
expenditure
which
required
attention
he
supposed
from
what
he
had
already
seen
of
a
commerce
with
the
world
that
the
sum
he
had
received
from
the
jew
was
not
above
half
what
he
needed
and
with
a
beating
heart
he
walked
towards
one
of
those
shops
which
robson
had
described
when
speaking
of
the
irregularities
of
her
son
who
had
nearly
reduced
her
to
beggary
the
candles
were
lit
and
as
he
hovered
about
the
door
he
distinctly
saw
the
master
through
the
glass
assorting
some
parcels
on
the
counter
he
was
a
man
and
the
count
feelings
took
quite
a
different
turn
from
those
with
which
he
had
accosted
the
jew
who
being
a
low
sordid
wretch
looked
upon
the
people
with
whom
he
trafficked
as
mere
purveyors
to
his
profit
thaddeus
felt
little
repugnance
at
bargaining
with
him
but
the
sight
of
a
respectable
person
before
whom
he
was
to
present
himself
as
a
man
in
poverty
as
one
who
in
a
manner
appealed
to
charity
all
at
once
overcame
the
resolution
of
a
son
of
sobieski
and
he
debated
whether
or
not
he
should
return
robson
and
her
probable
distresses
rose
before
him
and
fearful
of
trusting
his
pride
any
further
he
pulled
his
cap
over
his
face
and
entered
the
shop
the
man
bowed
very
civilly
on
his
entrance
and
requested
to
be
honored
with
his
commands
thaddeus
felt
his
face
glow
but
indignant
at
his
own
weakness
he
laid
the
gold
case
on
the
counter
and
said
in
a
voice
which
notwithstanding
his
emotion
he
constrained
to
be
without
appearance
of
confusion
i
want
to
part
with
this
astonished
at
the
dignity
of
the
applicant
air
and
the
nobility
of
his
dress
for
the
star
did
not
escape
the
eye
he
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
holding
the
case
in
his
hand
hurt
by
the
steadiness
of
his
gaze
the
count
rather
haughtily
repeated
what
he
had
said
the
man
hesitated
no
longer
he
had
been
accustomed
to
similar
requests
from
the
emigrant
french
but
there
was
a
loftiness
and
aspect
of
authority
in
the
countenance
and
mien
of
this
person
which
surprised
and
awed
him
and
with
a
respect
which
even
the
application
could
not
counteract
he
opened
the
case
and
inquired
of
thaddeus
what
was
the
price
he
affixed
to
it
i
leave
that
to
you
replied
he
the
gold
is
pure
returned
the
man
but
it
is
very
thin
i
can
not
give
more
than
three
guineas
though
the
workmanship
is
fine
it
is
not
in
the
fashion
of
england
and
will
be
of
no
benefit
to
me
till
melted
you
may
have
it
said
thaddeus
hardly
able
to
articulate
while
the
gift
of
his
mother
was
passing
into
a
stranger
hand
the
man
directly
paid
him
down
the
money
and
the
count
with
a
bursting
heart
darted
out
of
the
shop
robson
was
shutting
up
the
windows
of
her
little
parlor
when
he
hastily
passed
her
and
glided
up
the
stairs
hardly
believing
her
senses
she
hastened
after
him
and
just
got
into
the
room
as
he
drank
off
a
glass
of
water
good
lack
sir
where
has
your
honor
been
i
thought
you
were
all
the
while
in
the
house
and
i
would
not
come
near
though
i
was
very
uneasy
and
there
has
been
poor
william
crying
himself
blind
because
you
desired
to
be
left
alone
thaddeus
was
unprepared
to
make
an
answer
he
was
in
hopes
to
have
gotten
in
as
he
had
stolen
out
undiscovered
for
he
determined
not
to
agitate
her
too
kind
mind
by
the
history
of
his
loss
he
would
not
allow
her
to
know
anything
of
his
embarrassments
from
a
sentiment
of
justice
as
well
as
from
that
sensitive
pride
which
all
his
sufferings
and
philosophy
could
not
wholly
subdue
i
have
been
taking
a
walk
mrs
robson
dear
heart
i
thought
when
you
staggered
back
and
looked
so
ill
after
you
brought
in
william
you
had
yourself
no
i
fancy
my
fears
had
a
little
discomposed
me
and
i
hoped
that
more
air
might
do
me
good
i
tried
it
and
it
has
but
i
am
grieved
for
having
alarmed
you
this
ambiguous
speech
satisfied
his
worthy
landlady
and
fatigued
by
a
bodily
exertion
which
in
the
present
feeble
state
of
his
frame
nothing
less
than
the
resolution
of
his
mind
could
have
carried
him
through
thaddeus
went
directly
to
bed
where
tired
nature
soon
found
temporary
repose
in
a
profound
sleep
chapter
xv
the
widow
family
next
morning
sobieski
found
himself
rather
better
than
worse
by
the
exertions
of
the
preceding
clay
when
nanny
appeared
as
usual
with
his
breakfast
and
little
william
who
always
sat
on
his
knee
and
shared
his
bread
and
butter
the
count
desired
her
to
request
her
grandmother
to
send
to
vincent
with
his
compliments
and
to
say
her
lodger
felt
himself
so
much
recovered
as
to
decline
any
further
medical
aid
and
therefore
wished
to
have
his
bill
robson
who
could
not
forget
the
behavior
of
the
apothecary
undertook
to
deliver
the
message
herself
happy
in
the
triumph
she
should
enjoy
over
the
littleness
of
vincent
suspicions
after
the
lapse
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
in
the
count
rooms
accompanied
by
the
apothecary
assistant
who
with
many
thanks
received
the
sum
total
of
the
account
which
amounted
to
three
guineas
for
ten
days
attendance
the
man
having
withdrawn
thaddeus
told
robson
he
should
next
defray
the
smallest
part
of
the
vast
debt
he
must
ever
owe
to
her
parental
care
oh
bless
your
honor
it
goes
to
my
heart
to
take
a
farthing
of
you
but
these
poor
children
cried
she
laying
a
hand
on
each
and
her
eyes
glistening
they
look
up
to
me
as
their
all
here
and
my
was
yesterday
else
dear
sir
i
should
scorn
to
be
like
doctor
vincent
and
take
your
money
the
moment
you
offer
it
my
good
madam
returned
sobieski
giving
her
a
chair
i
am
sensible
of
your
kindness
but
it
is
your
just
due
and
the
payment
of
it
can
never
lessen
your
claim
on
my
gratitude
for
the
maternal
care
with
which
you
have
attended
me
a
total
stranger
then
there
sir
said
she
looking
almost
as
ashamed
as
if
she
were
robbing
him
when
she
laid
it
on
the
table
there
is
my
bill
i
have
regularly
set
down
everything
nanny
will
bring
it
to
me
and
quite
disconcerted
the
good
woman
hurried
out
of
the
room
thaddeus
looked
after
her
with
reverence
there
goes
thought
he
in
that
lowly
and
feeble
frame
as
generous
and
noble
a
spirit
as
ever
animated
the
breast
of
a
princess
here
nanny
said
he
glancing
his
eye
over
the
paper
there
is
the
gold
with
my
thanks
and
tell
your
grandmother
i
am
astonished
at
her
economy
this
affair
over
the
count
was
relieved
of
a
grievous
load
and
turning
the
remaining
money
in
his
hand
how
he
might
replenish
the
little
stock
before
it
were
expended
next
occupied
his
attention
notwithstanding
the
pawnbroker
civil
treatment
he
recoiled
at
again
presenting
himself
at
his
shop
besides
should
he
dispose
of
all
that
he
possessed
it
might
not
be
of
sufficient
value
here
to
subsist
him
a
month
he
must
think
of
some
source
within
himself
that
was
not
likely
to
be
so
soon
exhausted
to
be
reduced
a
second
time
to
the
misery
which
he
had
endured
yesterday
from
suspense
and
wretchedness
appeared
too
dreadful
to
be
hazarded
and
he
ran
over
in
his
memory
the
different
merits
of
his
several
accomplishments
he
could
not
make
any
use
of
his
musical
talents
for
at
public
exhibitions
of
himself
his
soul
revolted
and
as
to
his
literary
acquirements
his
youth
and
being
a
foreigner
precluded
all
hopes
on
that
head
at
length
he
found
that
his
sole
dependence
must
rest
on
his
talents
for
painting
of
this
art
he
had
always
been
remarkably
fond
and
his
taste
easily
perceived
that
there
were
many
drawings
exhibited
for
sale
much
inferior
to
those
which
he
had
executed
for
mere
amusement
he
decided
at
once
and
purchasing
by
the
means
of
nanny
pencils
and
indian
ink
he
set
to
work
when
he
had
finished
drawings
and
was
considering
how
he
might
find
the
street
in
which
he
had
seen
the
the
recollection
occurred
to
him
of
the
impression
his
appearance
had
made
on
the
pawnbroker
he
perceived
the
wide
difference
between
his
apparel
and
the
fashion
of
england
and
considering
the
security
from
impertinence
with
which
he
might
walk
about
could
he
so
far
cast
off
the
relics
of
his
former
rank
as
to
change
his
dress
he
rose
up
with
an
intention
to
go
out
and
purchase
a
surtout
coat
and
a
hat
for
that
purpose
when
catching
an
accidental
view
of
his
uniform
with
the
star
of
stanislaus
on
its
breast
as
he
passed
the
glass
he
no
longer
wondered
at
the
curiosity
which
such
an
appendage
united
with
poverty
had
attracted
rather
than
again
subject
himself
to
a
similar
situation
he
summoned
his
young
messenger
and
by
her
assistance
furnished
himself
with
an
english
hat
and
coat
whilst
with
his
penknife
he
cut
away
the
embroidery
of
the
order
from
the
cloth
to
which
it
was
affixed
thus
accoutred
with
his
hat
flapped
over
his
face
and
his
wrapped
round
him
he
put
the
drawings
into
his
bosom
and
about
eight
in
the
evening
walked
out
on
his
disagreeable
errand
after
some
wearying
search
he
at
last
found
great
newport
street
the
place
he
wanted
but
as
he
advanced
his
hopes
died
away
and
his
fears
and
reluctance
he
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
nearest
all
that
he
had
suffered
at
the
assailed
him
with
redoubled
violence
what
he
presented
there
possessed
a
fixed
value
and
was
at
once
to
be
taken
or
refused
but
now
he
was
going
to
offer
things
of
mere
taste
and
he
might
meet
not
only
with
a
denial
but
affronting
remarks
he
walked
to
the
threshold
of
the
door
then
as
hastily
withdrew
and
hurried
two
or
three
paces
down
the
street
weak
contemptible
that
i
am
said
he
to
himself
as
he
again
turned
round
where
is
all
my
reason
and
rectitude
of
principle
that
i
would
rather
endure
the
misery
of
dependence
and
than
dare
the
attempt
to
seek
support
from
the
fruits
of
my
own
industry
he
quickened
his
step
and
started
into
the
shop
almost
fearful
of
his
former
irresolution
he
threw
his
drawings
instantly
upon
the
counter
sir
you
purchase
drawings
i
have
these
to
sell
will
they
suit
you
the
man
took
them
up
without
deigning
to
look
at
the
person
who
had
accosted
him
and
turning
them
over
in
his
hand
one
two
three
hum
there
is
what
do
you
expect
for
them
i
am
not
acquainted
with
the
prices
of
these
things
the
printseller
hearing
this
thought
by
managing
well
to
get
them
for
what
he
liked
and
throwing
them
over
with
an
air
of
contempt
resumed
and
pray
where
may
the
views
be
taken
they
are
recollections
of
scenes
in
germany
ah
replied
the
man
mere
drugs
i
wish
honest
friend
you
could
have
brought
subjects
not
quite
so
threadbare
and
a
little
better
executed
they
are
but
poor
things
but
every
dauber
nowadays
sets
up
for
a
fine
artist
and
thinks
we
are
to
pay
him
for
spoilt
paper
and
conceit
insulted
by
this
speech
and
above
all
by
the
manner
of
the
printseller
thaddeus
was
snatching
up
the
drawings
to
leave
the
shop
without
a
word
when
the
man
observing
his
design
and
afraid
to
lose
them
laid
his
hand
on
the
heap
exclaiming
let
me
tell
you
young
man
it
does
not
become
a
person
in
your
situation
to
be
so
huffy
to
his
employers
i
will
give
you
a
guinea
for
the
six
and
you
may
think
yourself
well
paid
without
further
hesitation
whilst
the
count
was
striving
to
subdue
the
choler
which
urged
him
to
knock
him
down
the
man
laid
the
gold
on
the
counter
and
was
slipping
the
drawings
into
a
drawer
but
thaddeus
snatching
them
out
again
suddenly
rolled
them
up
and
walked
out
of
the
shop
as
he
said
not
all
the
money
of
all
your
tribe
should
tempt
an
honest
man
to
pollute
himself
by
exchanging
a
second
word
with
one
so
contemptible
irritated
at
this
unfeeling
treatment
he
returned
home
too
much
provoked
to
think
of
the
consequences
which
might
follow
a
similar
disappointment
having
become
used
to
the
fluctuations
of
his
looks
and
behavior
the
widow
ceased
altogether
to
tease
him
with
inquiries
which
she
saw
he
was
sometimes
loath
to
answer
she
now
allowed
him
to
walk
in
and
out
without
a
remark
and
silently
contemplated
his
pale
and
melancholy
countenance
when
after
a
ramble
of
the
greatest
part
of
the
day
he
returned
home
exhausted
and
dispirited
william
was
always
the
first
to
welcome
his
friend
at
the
threshold
by
running
to
him
taking
hold
of
his
coat
and
asking
to
go
with
him
up
stairs
the
count
usually
gratified
him
and
brightened
many
dull
hours
with
his
innocent
caresses
this
child
was
literally
his
only
earthly
comfort
for
he
saw
that
in
him
he
could
still
excite
those
emotions
of
happiness
which
had
once
afforded
him
his
sweetest
joy
william
ever
greeted
him
with
smiles
and
when
he
entered
the
kitchen
sprang
to
his
bosom
as
if
that
were
the
seat
of
peace
as
it
was
of
virtue
but
alas
fate
seemed
adverse
to
lend
anything
long
to
the
unhappy
thaddeus
which
might
render
his
desolate
state
more
tolerable
just
risen
from
a
bed
of
sickness
he
required
the
hand
of
some
tender
nurse
to
restore
his
wasted
vigor
instead
of
being
reduced
to
the
hard
vigils
of
poverty
and
want
his
recent
disappointment
added
to
a
cold
which
he
had
caught
increased
his
feverish
debility
yet
he
adhered
to
the
determination
not
to
appropriate
to
his
own
subsistence
the
few
valuables
he
had
assigned
as
a
deposit
for
the
charges
of
his
rent
during
a
fortnight
he
never
tasted
anything
better
than
bread
and
water
but
this
hermit
fare
was
accompanied
by
the
resigned
thought
that
if
it
ended
in
death
his
sufferings
would
then
be
over
and
the
widow
amply
remunerated
by
what
little
of
his
property
remained
in
this
state
of
body
and
mind
he
received
a
most
painful
shock
when
one
evening
returning
from
a
walk
of
many
hours
in
the
place
of
his
little
favorite
he
met
robson
in
tears
at
the
door
she
told
him
william
had
been
sickening
all
the
day
and
was
now
so
delirious
that
neither
she
nor
his
sister
could
keep
him
quiet
thaddeus
went
to
the
side
of
the
child
bed
where
he
lay
gasping
on
the
pillow
held
clown
by
the
crying
nanny
the
count
touched
his
cheek
poor
child
exclaimed
he
he
is
in
a
high
fever
have
you
sent
for
mr
vincent
o
no
i
had
not
the
heart
to
leave
him
then
i
will
go
directly
returned
thaddeus
there
is
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
the
poor
woman
thanked
him
hastening
through
the
streets
with
an
eagerness
which
nearly
overset
several
of
the
he
arrived
at
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
after
he
quitted
robson
door
he
returned
with
the
apothecary
on
vincent
examining
the
pulse
and
countenance
of
his
little
patient
he
declared
the
symptoms
to
be
the
which
some
casualty
had
repelled
in
a
paroxysm
of
distress
robson
recollected
that
a
girl
had
been
brought
into
her
shop
three
days
ago
just
recovered
from
that
frightful
malady
thaddeus
tried
to
subdue
the
fears
of
the
grandmother
and
at
last
succeeded
in
persuading
her
to
go
to
bed
whilst
he
and
nanny
would
watch
by
the
pillow
of
the
invalid
towards
morning
the
disorder
broke
out
on
the
child
face
and
he
recovered
his
recollection
the
moment
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
count
who
was
leaning
over
him
he
stretched
out
his
little
arms
and
begged
to
lie
on
his
breast
thaddeus
refused
him
gently
fearing
that
by
any
change
of
position
he
might
catch
cold
and
so
again
retard
what
had
now
so
fortunately
appeared
but
the
poor
child
thought
the
denial
unkind
and
began
to
weep
so
violently
that
his
anxious
friend
believed
it
better
to
gratify
him
than
hazard
the
irritation
of
his
fever
by
agitation
and
crying
thaddeus
took
him
out
of
bed
and
rolling
him
in
one
of
the
blankets
laid
him
in
his
bosom
and
drawing
his
to
shield
the
little
face
from
the
fire
held
him
in
that
situation
asleep
for
nearly
two
hours
when
robson
came
down
stairs
at
six
in
the
morning
she
kissed
the
hand
of
the
count
as
he
sustained
her
grandson
in
his
arms
and
almost
speechless
with
gratitude
to
him
and
solicitude
for
the
child
waited
the
arrival
of
the
apothecary
on
his
second
visit
he
said
a
few
words
to
her
of
comfort
but
whispered
to
the
count
while
softly
feeling
william
pulse
that
nothing
short
of
the
strictest
care
could
save
the
boy
the
infection
he
had
received
having
been
of
the
most
malignant
kind
these
words
fell
like
an
unrepealable
sentence
on
the
heart
of
thaddeus
looking
on
the
discolored
features
of
the
patient
infant
he
fancied
that
he
already
beheld
its
face
and
its
little
limbs
stretched
in
death
the
idea
was
bitterness
to
him
and
pressing
the
boy
to
his
breast
he
resolved
that
no
attention
should
be
wanting
on
his
part
to
preserve
him
from
the
grave
and
he
kept
his
promise
from
that
hour
until
the
day
in
which
the
poor
babe
expired
in
his
arms
he
never
laid
him
out
of
them
for
ten
minutes
together
and
when
he
did
breathe
his
last
sigh
and
raised
up
his
little
eyes
thaddeus
met
their
dying
glance
with
a
pang
which
he
thought
his
soul
had
long
lost
the
power
to
feel
his
heart
seemed
to
stop
and
covering
the
motionless
face
of
the
dead
child
with
his
hand
he
made
a
sign
to
nanny
to
leave
the
room
the
girl
who
from
respect
had
been
accustomed
to
obey
his
slightest
nod
went
to
her
grandmother
in
the
shop
the
instant
the
girl
quitted
the
room
with
mingled
awe
and
grief
the
count
lifted
the
little
corpse
from
his
knee
and
without
allowing
himself
to
cast
another
glance
on
the
face
of
the
poor
infant
now
released
from
suffering
he
put
it
on
the
bed
and
throwing
the
sheet
over
it
sunk
into
a
chair
and
burst
into
tears
the
entrance
of
robson
in
some
measure
restored
him
for
the
moment
she
perceived
her
guest
with
his
handkerchief
over
his
eyes
she
judged
what
had
happened
and
with
a
piercing
scream
flew
forward
to
the
bed
where
pulling
down
the
covering
she
uttered
another
shriek
and
must
have
fallen
on
the
floor
had
not
thaddeus
and
little
nanny
who
ran
in
at
her
cries
caught
her
in
their
arms
and
bore
her
to
a
chair
her
soul
was
too
much
agitated
to
allow
her
to
continue
long
in
a
state
of
insensibility
and
when
she
recovered
she
would
again
have
approached
the
deceased
child
but
the
count
withheld
her
and
trying
by
every
means
in
his
power
to
soothe
her
so
far
succeeded
as
to
melt
her
agonies
into
tears
whilst
she
concealed
her
venerable
head
in
the
bosom
of
her
granddaughter
he
once
more
lifted
the
remains
of
the
little
william
and
thinking
it
best
for
the
tranquillity
of
the
unhappy
grandmother
to
take
him
out
of
her
sight
he
carried
him
up
stairs
and
laid
him
on
his
own
bed
by
the
time
he
returned
to
the
humble
parlor
one
of
the
female
neighbors
having
heard
the
unusual
outcry
and
suspecting
the
cause
kindly
stepped
in
to
offer
her
consolation
and
services
robson
could
only
reply
by
sobs
which
were
answered
by
the
loud
weeping
of
poor
nanny
who
lay
with
her
head
against
the
table
when
the
count
came
down
he
thanked
the
worthy
woman
for
her
benevolent
intentions
and
took
her
up
stairs
into
his
apartments
pointing
to
the
open
door
of
the
bedroom
there
madam
said
he
you
will
find
the
remains
of
my
dear
little
friend
i
beg
you
will
direct
everything
for
his
interment
that
you
think
will
give
satisfaction
to
robson
i
would
spare
that
excellent
woman
every
pang
in
my
power
all
was
done
according
to
his
desire
and
watts
the
charitable
neighbor
excited
by
a
kindly
disposition
and
reverence
for
the
extraordinary
young
gentleman
who
lodged
with
her
friend
performed
her
task
with
tenderness
and
activity
oh
sir
cried
robson
weeping
afresh
as
she
entered
the
count
room
oh
sir
how
shall
i
ever
repay
all
your
goodness
and
watt
she
has
acted
like
a
sister
to
me
but
indeed
i
am
yet
the
most
miserable
creature
that
lives
i
have
lost
my
dearest
child
and
must
strip
his
poor
sister
of
her
daily
bread
to
bury
him
that
cruel
vincent
though
he
might
have
imagined
my
distress
sent
his
account
late
last
night
saying
he
wanted
to
make
up
a
large
bill
and
he
wished
i
would
let
him
have
all
or
part
of
the
payment
heaven
knows
i
have
not
a
farthing
in
the
house
but
i
will
send
poor
little
nanny
to
pawn
my
silver
spoons
for
alas
i
have
no
other
means
of
satisfying
the
cruel
man
rapacious
wretch
cried
thaddeus
rising
indignantly
from
his
chair
and
for
a
moment
forgetting
how
incapable
he
was
to
afford
relief
you
shall
not
be
indebted
one
instant
to
his
mercy
i
will
pay
him
the
words
had
passed
his
lips
he
could
not
retract
though
conviction
immediately
followed
that
he
had
not
the
means
and
he
would
not
have
retracted
even
should
he
be
necessitated
to
part
with
everything
he
most
valued
robson
was
overwhelmed
by
this
generous
promise
which
indeed
saved
her
from
ruin
had
her
little
plate
been
pledged
it
could
not
have
covered
one
half
of
vincent
demand
who
to
do
him
justice
did
not
mean
to
cause
any
distress
but
having
been
so
readily
paid
by
thaddeus
for
his
own
illness
and
observing
his
great
care
and
affection
for
the
deceased
child
he
did
not
doubt
that
rather
than
allow
robson
a
minute
uneasiness
her
lodger
would
defray
his
bill
so
far
he
calculated
right
but
he
had
not
sufficient
sagacity
to
foresee
that
in
getting
his
money
this
way
he
should
lose
the
future
business
of
robson
and
her
friend
the
child
was
to
be
buried
on
the
morrow
the
expenses
of
which
event
thaddeus
saw
he
must
discharge
also
and
he
had
engaged
to
pay
vincent
that
night
he
had
not
a
shilling
in
his
purse
over
and
over
he
contemplated
the
impracticability
of
answering
these
debts
yet
he
could
not
for
an
instant
repent
of
what
he
had
undertaken
he
thought
he
was
amply
recompensed
for
bearing
so
heavy
a
load
in
knowing
that
he
had
taken
it
off
the
heart
of
another
chapter
xvi
the
since
the
count
unmannerly
treatment
at
the
printseller
he
had
not
sufficiently
conquered
his
pride
to
attempt
an
application
to
another
therefore
he
had
no
prospect
of
collecting
the
money
he
had
pledged
himself
to
robson
to
pay
but
by
selling
some
more
of
his
valuables
to
the
pawnbroker
for
this
purpose
he
took
his
sabre
his
pistols
and
the
fated
brilliants
he
had
brought
back
on
a
similar
errand
he
drew
them
from
their
deposit
with
less
feeling
of
sacrilege
in
so
disposing
of
such
relics
of
the
sacred
past
than
he
had
felt
on
the
former
occasion
they
were
now
going
to
be
devoted
to
gratitude
and
benevolence
an
act
which
he
knew
his
parents
were
they
alive
would
warmly
approve
and
here
he
allowed
the
end
to
sanctify
the
means
about
six
in
the
evening
he
prepared
himself
for
the
task
whether
it
be
congenial
with
melancholy
to
seek
the
gloom
or
whether
the
count
found
himself
less
observed
under
the
shades
of
night
is
not
evident
but
since
his
exile
he
preferred
the
dusk
to
any
other
part
of
the
day
before
he
went
out
he
asked
robson
for
vincent
bill
sinking
with
obligation
and
shame
she
put
it
into
his
hand
and
he
left
the
house
when
he
approached
a
lighted
lamp
he
opened
the
paper
to
see
the
amount
and
finding
that
it
was
almost
two
pounds
he
hastened
forward
to
the
the
man
was
in
the
shop
alone
thaddeus
thought
himself
fortunate
and
after
subduing
a
few
qualms
entered
the
door
the
moment
he
laid
his
sword
and
pistols
on
the
counter
and
declared
his
wish
the
man
even
through
the
disguise
of
a
large
coat
and
slouched
hat
recollected
him
this
honest
carried
sentiments
in
his
breast
above
his
occupation
he
did
not
commiserate
all
who
presented
themselves
before
him
because
many
exhibited
too
evidently
the
excesses
which
brought
them
to
his
shop
but
there
was
something
in
the
figure
and
manner
of
the
count
sobieski
which
had
struck
him
at
first
sight
and
by
continuing
to
possess
his
thoughts
had
excited
so
great
an
interest
towards
him
as
to
produce
pleasure
with
regret
when
he
discerned
the
noble
foreigner
again
obliged
to
proffer
such
things
burket
for
so
this
was
called
respectfully
asked
what
he
demanded
for
the
arms
perhaps
more
than
you
would
give
but
i
have
something
else
here
laying
down
the
diamonds
i
want
eight
guineas
burket
looked
at
them
and
then
at
their
owner
hesitated
and
then
spoke
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
hope
i
shall
not
offend
you
but
these
things
appear
to
have
a
value
independent
of
their
price
they
are
inlaid
with
crests
and
ciphers
the
blood
flushed
over
the
cheeks
of
the
count
he
had
forgotten
this
circumstance
unable
to
answer
he
waited
to
hear
what
the
man
would
say
further
i
repeat
sir
i
mean
not
to
offend
but
you
appear
a
stranger
to
these
transactions
i
only
wish
to
suggest
in
case
you
should
ever
like
to
repossess
these
valuables
had
you
not
better
pledge
them
how
asked
thaddeus
irresolutely
and
not
knowing
what
to
think
of
the
man
manner
at
that
instant
some
other
people
came
into
the
shop
and
burket
gathering
up
the
diamonds
and
the
arms
in
his
hand
said
if
you
do
not
object
sir
we
will
settle
this
business
in
my
the
delicacy
of
his
behavior
penetrated
the
mind
of
thaddeus
and
without
demurring
he
followed
him
into
a
room
while
burket
offered
his
guest
a
chair
the
count
took
off
his
hat
and
laid
it
on
the
table
burket
contemplated
the
saddened
dignity
of
his
countenance
with
renewed
interest
entreating
him
to
be
seated
he
resumed
the
conversation
i
see
sir
you
do
not
understand
the
meaning
of
pledging
or
pawning
for
it
is
one
and
the
same
thing
but
i
will
explain
it
in
two
words
if
you
leave
these
things
with
me
i
will
give
you
a
paper
in
acknowledgment
and
lend
on
them
the
guineas
you
request
for
which
sum
when
you
return
it
to
me
with
a
stated
interest
you
shall
have
your
deposit
in
exchange
sobieski
received
this
offer
with
pleasure
and
thanks
he
had
entertained
no
idea
of
anything
more
being
meant
by
the
trade
of
a
pawnbroker
than
a
man
who
bought
what
others
wished
to
sell
then
sir
continued
burket
opening
an
escritoire
i
will
give
you
the
money
and
write
the
paper
i
spoke
of
just
as
he
put
his
hand
to
the
drawer
he
heard
voices
in
an
adjoining
passage
and
instantly
shutting
the
desk
he
caught
up
the
things
on
the
table
threw
them
behind
a
curtain
and
hastily
taking
the
count
by
the
hand
said
my
dear
sir
do
oblige
me
and
step
into
that
closet
you
will
find
a
chair
a
person
is
coming
whom
i
will
dispatch
in
a
few
seconds
thaddeus
rather
surprised
at
such
hurry
did
as
he
was
desired
and
the
door
was
closed
on
him
just
as
the
parlor
door
opened
being
aware
from
such
concealment
that
the
visitor
came
on
secret
business
he
found
his
situation
not
a
little
awkward
seated
behind
a
curtained
window
which
the
lights
in
the
room
made
transparent
he
could
not
avoid
seeing
as
well
as
hearing
everything
that
passed
my
dear
burket
cried
an
elegant
young
creature
who
ran
into
the
apartment
positively
without
your
assistance
i
shall
be
undone
anything
in
my
power
madam
returned
my
burket
with
a
distant
respectful
voice
will
your
ladyship
sit
down
yes

me
a
chair

am
half
dead
with
distraction
burket
i
must

my
power

pawnbroker
cried
the
lady
laughing

well

he
with
a
smile
as
your
ladyship
pleases

exclaimed
her
ladyship
purposely
miscalling
his
name

better
than
mine

king
of
sardinia

them
to
sir
charles
when
he
knighted
him

heavens
what
a
brute
of
a
man

she
taking
a
string
of
pearls
from
her
neck
and
throwing
it
on
the
table
lend

some
of
your
trumpery

of
your
shop

and

her

angrily

veriest
miser

shylock
or

this
exclaimed
she
interrupting
herself
and
taking
up
the
draft
he
had
laid
before
her
and
have
you
the
conscience
to
think
pawnbroker
that
i
will
offer
this
at
your
banker
that
i
will
expose

must
disappoint
my
party
look
there
is
my
purse
added
she
showing
it
make
haste
and
fill
it
after
satisfying
her
demands
burket
handed
her
ladyship
out
the
way
she
came
in
which
was
by
a
private
passage
and
having
seated
her
in
her
carriage
made
his
bow
meanwhile
the
count
sobieski
wrapped
in
astonishment
at
the
profligacy
which
the
scene
he
had
witnessed
implied
remained
in
concealment
until
the
pawnbroker
returned
and
opened
the
door
sir
said
he
coloring
you
have
undesignedly
on
your
part
been
privy
to
a
very
delicate
affair
but
my
credit
sir
and
your
honor
shall
both
be
sacred
replied
the
count
anxious
to
relieve
the
poor
man
from
his
perplexity
and
forbearing
to
express
surprise
but
burket
perceived
it
in
his
look
and
before
he
proceeded
to
fulfill
the
engagement
with
him
stepped
half
way
to
the
escritoire
and
resumed
you
appear
amazed
sir
at
what
you
have
seen
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
you
are
from
abroad
indeed
i
am
amazed
replied
sobieski
and
i
am
from
a
country
where
the
slightest
suspicion
of
a
transaction
such
as
this
would
brand
the
woman
with
infamy
and
so
it
ought
answered
burket
though
by
that
assertion
i
speak
against
my
own
interest
for
it
is
by
such
as
lady
hilliars
we
make
our
money
now
sir
continued
he
drawing
nearer
to
the
table
perhaps
after
what
you
have
just
beheld
you
will
not
hesitate
to
credit
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
i
have
now
in
my
hands
the
jewels
of
one
duchess
of
three
countesses
and
of
women
of
fashion
without
number
when
these
ladies
have
an
ill
run
at
play
they
apply
to
me
in
their
exigencies
they
bring
their
diamonds
here
and
as
their
occasions
require
on
that
deposit
i
lend
them
money
for
which
they
make
me
a
handsome
present
when
the
jewels
are
released
you
astonish
me
exclaimed
thaddeus
what
a
degrading
system
of
deceit
must
govern
the
lives
of
these
women
it
is
very
lamentable
returned
burket
but
so
it
is
and
they
continue
to
manage
matters
very
cleverly
by
giving
me
their
note
or
word
of
honor
for
if
these
ladies
are
not
honorable
with
me
i
know
by
what
hints
to
keep
them
in
order
i
allow
them
to
have
the
jewels
out
for
the
and
receive
them
again
when
their
exhibition
is
over
as
a
compensation
for
these
little
indulgences
i
expect
considerable
additions
to
the
at
the
end
thaddeus
could
hardly
believe
such
a
history
of
those
women
whom
travellers
mentioned
as
not
only
the
most
lovely
but
the
most
amiable
creatures
in
the
world
surely
burket
cried
he
these
ladies
must
despise
each
other
and
become
contemptible
even
to
our
sex
o
no
rejoined
the
pawnbroker
they
seldom
trust
each
other
in
these
affairs
all
my
fair
customers
are
not
so
silly
as
that
pretty
little
lady
who
just
now
left
us
she
and
another
woman
of
quality
have
made
each
other
confidants
in
this
business
and
i
have
no
mercy
when
both
come
together
they
are
as
ravenous
of
my
money
as
if
it
had
no
other
use
but
to
supply
them
as
to
their
husbands
brothers
and
fathers
they
are
usually
the
last
people
who
suspect
or
hear
of
these
matters
their
applications
when
they
run
out
are
made
to
jews
and
professed
usurers
a
race
completely
out
of
our
line
but
are
all
english
women
of
quality
of
this
disgraceful
stamp
no
heaven
forbid
cried
burket
if
these
female
spendthrifts
were
not
held
in
awe
by
the
dread
of
superior
characters
we
could
have
no
dependence
on
their
promises
oh
no
there
are
ladies
about
the
court
whose
virtues
are
as
eminent
as
their
rank
women
whose
actions
might
all
be
performed
in
before
the
world
and
them
i
never
see
within
my
doors
well
burket
rejoined
thaddeus
smiling
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
yet
i
can
not
forget
the
unexpected
view
of
the
famous
british
fair
which
this
night
has
offered
to
my
eyes
it
is
strange
it
is
very
bad
indeed
sir
returned
the
man
giving
him
the
money
and
the
paper
he
had
been
preparing
but
if
you
should
have
occasion
to
call
again
upon
me
perhaps
you
may
be
astonished
still
further
the
count
bowed
and
thanking
him
for
his
kindness
wished
him
a
good
evening
and
left
the
shop
footnote
the
whole
of
this
scene
at
the
pawnbroker
is
too
true
the
writer
knows
it
from
an
eye
and
witness
it
was
about
seven
when
thaddeus
arrived
at
the
apothecary
vincent
was
from
home
to
say
the
truth
he
had
purposely
gone
out
of
the
way
for
though
he
did
not
hesitate
to
commit
a
shabby
action
he
wanted
courage
to
face
its
consequence
and
to
avoid
the
probable
remonstrances
of
robson
he
commissioned
his
assistant
to
receive
the
amount
of
the
bill
without
making
an
observation
the
count
paid
the
man
and
was
returning
homeward
along
duke
street
and
the
piazzas
of
drury
lane
theatre
when
the
crowd
around
the
doors
constrained
him
to
stop
after
two
or
three
ineffectual
attempts
to
get
through
the
bustle
he
retreated
a
little
behind
the
mob
at
the
moment
when
a
chariot
drew
up
and
a
gentleman
stepping
out
with
two
ladies
darted
with
them
into
the
house
one
glance
was
sufficient
for
sobieski
who
recognized
his
friend
pembroke
somerset
in
full
dress
gay
and
laughing
the
heart
of
thaddeus
sprang
to
him
at
the
sight
and
forgetting
his
neglect
and
his
own
misfortunes
he
ejaculated
somerset
trembling
with
eagerness
and
emotion
he
pressed
through
the
crowd
and
entered
the
passage
at
the
instant
a
green
door
within
shut
upon
his
friend
his
disappointment
was
dreadful
to
be
so
near
somerset
and
to
lose
him
was
more
than
he
could
sustain
his
bounding
heart
recoiled
and
the
chill
of
despair
running
through
his
veins
turned
him
faint
leaning
against
the
passage
door
he
took
his
hat
off
to
give
himself
air
he
scarcely
had
stood
a
minute
in
this
situation
revolving
whether
he
should
follow
his
friend
into
the
house
or
wait
until
he
came
out
again
when
a
gentleman
begged
him
to
make
way
for
a
party
of
ladies
that
were
entering
thaddeus
moved
to
one
side
but
the
opening
of
the
green
door
casting
a
strong
light
both
on
his
face
and
the
group
behind
his
eyes
and
those
of
the
impertinent
inquisitor
of
the
hummums
met
each
other
whether
the
man
was
conscious
that
he
deserved
chastisement
for
his
former
insolence
and
dreaded
to
meet
it
now
can
not
be
explained
but
he
turned
pale
and
shuffled
by
thaddeus
as
if
he
were
fearful
to
trust
himself
within
reach
of
his
grasp
as
for
the
count
he
was
too
deeply
interested
in
his
own
pursuit
to
waste
one
surmise
upon
him
he
continued
to
muse
on
the
sight
of
pembroke
somerset
which
had
conjured
up
ten
thousand
fond
and
distressing
recollections
and
with
impatient
anxiety
determining
to
watch
till
the
performance
was
over
he
thought
of
inquiring
his
friend
address
of
the
servants
but
on
looking
round
for
that
purpose
he
perceived
the
chariot
had
driven
away
thus
foiled
he
returned
to
his
post
near
the
green
door
which
was
opened
at
intervals
by
footmen
passing
and
repassing
seeing
that
the
chamber
within
was
a
lobby
in
which
it
would
be
less
likely
he
should
miss
his
object
than
if
he
continued
standing
without
he
entered
with
the
next
person
that
approached
finding
seats
along
the
sides
he
sat
down
on
the
one
nearest
to
the
stairs
his
first
idea
was
to
proceed
into
the
playhouse
but
he
considered
the
small
chance
of
discovering
any
particular
individual
in
so
vast
a
building
as
not
equal
to
the
expense
he
must
incur
besides
from
the
dress
of
the
gentlemen
who
entered
the
he
was
sensible
that
his
greatcoat
and
round
hat
were
not
admissible
footnote
a
nearly
full
dress
was
worn
at
that
time
by
ladies
and
gentlemen
at
the
great
theatres
and
much
respect
has
been
lost
to
the
higher
classes
by
the
gradual
change
having
remained
above
an
hour
with
his
eyes
invariably
fixed
on
the
stairs
he
observed
that
some
curious
person
who
had
passed
almost
directly
after
his
friend
came
down
the
steps
and
walked
out
in
two
minutes
he
was
returning
with
a
smirking
countenance
when
his
eyes
accidentally
falling
on
the
count
who
sat
with
his
arms
folded
and
almost
hidden
by
the
shadow
of
the
wall
he
faltered
in
his
step
stretching
out
his
neck
towards
him
the
gay
grin
left
his
features
and
exclaiming
in
an
impatient
voice
confound
him
he
hastened
once
more
into
the
house
this
rencontre
with
his
hummums
acquaintance
affected
thaddeus
as
slightly
as
the
former
and
without
annexing
even
a
thought
to
his
figure
as
it
flitted
by
him
he
remained
watching
in
the
lobby
until
eleven
at
that
hour
the
doors
were
thrown
open
and
the
company
began
to
pour
forth
the
count
hopes
were
again
on
his
lips
and
in
his
eyes
with
the
first
party
who
came
clown
the
steps
he
rose
and
planting
himself
close
to
the
bottom
stair
drew
his
hat
over
his
face
and
narrowly
examined
each
group
as
it
descended
every
set
that
approached
made
his
heart
palpitate
how
often
did
it
rise
and
fall
during
the
long
succession
which
continued
moving
for
nearly
half
an
hour
by
twelve
the
house
was
cleared
he
saw
the
middle
door
locked
and
motionless
with
disappointment
did
not
attempt
to
stir
until
the
man
who
held
the
keys
told
him
to
go
as
he
was
about
to
fasten
the
other
doors
this
roused
thaddeus
and
as
he
was
preparing
to
obey
he
asked
the
man
if
there
were
any
other
passage
from
the
boxes
yes
cried
he
there
is
one
into
drury
lane
then
by
that
i
have
lost
him
was
the
reply
which
he
made
to
himself
and
returning
homewards
he
arrived
there
a
few
minutes
after
twelve
chapter
xvii
the
meeting
of
exiles
and
they
lifted
up
their
voices
and
wept
thaddeus
awoke
in
the
morning
with
his
heart
full
of
the
last
rencontre
one
moment
he
regretted
that
he
had
not
been
seen
by
his
friend
in
the
next
when
he
surveyed
his
altered
state
he
was
almost
reconciled
to
the
disappointment
then
reproaching
himself
for
a
pride
so
unbecoming
his
principles
and
dishonorable
to
friendship
he
asked
if
he
were
in
somerset
place
and
somerset
in
his
whether
he
could
ever
pardon
the
morose
delicacy
which
had
prevented
the
communication
of
his
friend
misfortunes
and
arrival
in
the
same
kingdom
with
himself
these
reflections
soon
persuaded
his
judgment
to
what
his
heart
was
so
much
inclined
determining
him
to
inquire
pembroke
address
of
every
one
likely
to
know
a
man
of
sir
robert
somerset
consequence
and
then
to
venture
a
letter
in
the
midst
of
these
meditations
the
door
opened
and
robson
appeared
drowned
in
tears
my
dear
dear
sir
cried
she
my
william
is
going
i
have
just
taken
a
last
look
of
his
sweet
face
will
you
go
down
and
say
farewell
to
the
poor
child
you
loved
so
dearly
no
my
good
madam
returned
thaddeus
his
straying
thoughts
at
once
gathering
round
this
mournful
centre
i
will
rather
retain
you
here
until
the
melancholy
task
be
entirely
accomplished
with
gentle
violence
he
forced
her
upon
a
seat
and
in
silence
supported
her
head
on
his
breast
against
which
she
unconsciously
leaned
and
wept
he
listened
with
a
depressed
heart
to
the
removal
of
the
coffin
and
at
the
closing
of
the
street
door
which
forever
shut
the
little
william
from
that
house
in
which
he
had
been
the
source
of
its
greatest
pleasure
a
tear
trickled
down
the
cheek
of
thaddeus
and
the
sobbings
of
the
poor
grandmother
were
audible
the
count
incapable
of
speaking
pressed
her
hand
in
his
oh
mr
constantine
cried
she
see
how
my
supports
one
after
the
other
are
taken
from
me
first
my
son
and
now
his
infant
to
what
shall
i
be
reduced
you
have
still
my
good
robson
a
friend
in
heaven
who
will
supply
the
place
of
all
you
have
lost
on
earth
true
dear
sir
i
am
a
wicked
creature
to
speak
as
i
have
done
but
it
is
hard
to
suffer
it
is
hard
to
lose
all
we
loved
in
the
world
it
is
returned
the
count
greatly
affected
by
her
grief
but
god
who
is
perfect
wisdom
as
well
as
perfect
love
chooseth
rather
to
profit
us
than
to
please
us
in
his
dispensations
our
sweet
william
has
gained
by
our
loss
he
is
blessed
in
heaven
while
we
weakly
lament
him
on
earth
besides
you
are
not
yet
deprived
of
all
you
have
a
ah
poor
little
thing
what
will
become
of
her
when
i
die
i
used
to
think
what
a
precious
brother
my
darling
boy
would
prove
to
his
sister
when
i
should
be
no
more
this
additional
image
augmented
the
affliction
of
the
good
old
woman
and
thaddeus
looking
on
her
with
affectionate
compassion
exclaimed
robson
the
same
almighty
being
that
protected
me
the
last
of
my
family
will
protect
the
orphan
offspring
of
a
woman
so
like
the
revered
naomi
robson
lifted
up
her
head
for
a
moment
she
had
never
before
heard
him
utter
a
sentence
of
his
own
history
and
what
he
now
said
added
to
the
tender
solemnity
of
his
manner
for
an
instant
arrested
her
attention
he
went
on
in
me
you
see
a
man
who
within
the
short
space
of
three
months
has
lost
a
grandfather
who
loved
him
as
fondly
as
you
did
your
william
a
mother
whom
he
saw
expire
before
him
and
whose
sacred
remains
he
was
forced
to
leave
in
the
hands
of
her
murderers
yes
robson
i
have
neither
parents
nor
a
home
i
was
a
stranger
and
you
took
me
in
and
heaven
will
reward
your
family
in
kind
at
least
i
promise
that
whilst
i
live
whatever
be
my
fate
should
you
be
called
hence
i
will
protect
your
with
a
brother
care
may
heaven
in
mercy
bless
you
cried
robson
dropping
on
her
knees
thaddeus
raised
her
with
gushing
eyes
having
replaced
her
in
a
seat
he
left
the
room
to
recover
himself
according
to
the
count
desire
watts
called
in
the
evening
with
an
estimate
of
the
expenses
attending
the
child
interment
fees
and
every
charge
collected
the
demand
on
his
benevolence
was
six
pounds
the
sum
proved
rather
more
than
he
expected
but
he
paid
it
without
a
demur
leaving
himself
only
a
few
shillings
he
considered
what
he
had
done
as
a
fulfilment
of
a
duty
so
indispensible
that
it
must
have
been
accomplished
even
by
the
sacrifice
of
his
uttermost
farthing
gratitude
and
distress
held
claims
upon
him
which
he
never
allowed
his
own
necessities
to
transgress
all
gifts
of
mere
generosity
were
beyond
his
power
and
consequently
in
a
short
time
beyond
his
wish
but
to
the
cry
of
want
and
wretchedness
his
hand
and
heart
were
ever
open
often
has
he
given
away
to
a
starving
child
in
the
street
that
pittance
which
was
to
purchase
his
own
scant
meal
and
he
never
felt
such
neglect
of
himself
a
privation
to
have
turned
his
eyes
and
ears
from
the
little
mendicant
would
have
been
the
hardest
struggle
and
the
remembrance
of
such
inhumanity
would
have
haunted
him
on
his
pillow
this
being
the
disposition
of
count
sobieski
he
found
it
more
difficult
to
bear
calamity
when
viewing
another
poverty
he
could
not
relieve
than
when
assailed
himself
by
penury
in
all
its
other
shapes
of
desolation
towards
night
the
idea
of
somerset
again
presented
itself
when
he
fell
asleep
his
dreams
repeated
the
scene
at
the
playhouse
again
he
saw
him
and
again
he
eluded
his
grasp
his
waking
thoughts
were
not
less
true
to
their
object
and
next
morning
he
went
to
a
quiet
in
the
lane
where
he
called
for
breakfast
and
inquired
of
the
master
did
he
know
the
residence
of
sir
robert
somerset
the
question
was
no
sooner
asked
than
it
was
answered
to
his
satisfaction
the
court
guide
was
examined
and
he
found
this
address
sir
robert
somerset
grosvenor
square
somerset
castle
l
shire
deerhurst
w
shire
gladdened
by
the
discovery
thaddeus
hastened
home
and
unwilling
to
affect
his
friend
by
a
sudden
appearance
with
an
overflowing
heart
he
wrote
the
following
letter
to
pembroke
somerset
grosvenor
square
dear
somerset
will
the
name
at
the
bottom
of
this
paper
surprise
you
will
it
give
you
pleasure
i
can
not
suffer
myself
to
retain
a
doubt
although
the
silence
of
two
years
might
almost
convince
me
i
am
forgotten
in
truth
somerset
i
had
resolved
never
to
obtrude
myself
and
my
misfortunes
on
your
knowledge
until
last
wednesday
night
when
i
saw
you
going
into
drury
lane
theatre
the
sight
of
you
quelled
all
my
resentment
and
i
called
after
you
but
you
did
not
hear
pardon
me
my
dear
friend
that
i
speak
of
resentment
it
is
hard
to
learn
resignation
to
the
forgetfulness
of
those
we
love
notwithstanding
that
i
lost
the
in
a
battlefield
which
contained
your
direction
i
wrote
to
you
frequently
at
a
venture
and
yet
though
you
knew
in
what
spot
in
poland
you
had
left
thaddeus
and
his
family
i
have
never
heard
of
you
since
the
day
of
our
separation
you
must
have
some
good
reason
for
your
silence
at
least
i
hope
so
doubtless
public
report
has
afforded
you
some
information
relative
to
the
destruction
of
my
country
i
bear
its
fate
on
myself
you
will
find
me
in
a
poor
lodging
at
the
bottom
of
martin
lane
you
will
find
me
changed
in
everything
but
the
first
horrors
of
grief
have
subsided
and
my
clearest
consolation
in
the
midst
of
my
affliction
rises
out
of
its
bitterest
cause
i
thank
heaven
my
revered
grandfather
and
mother
were
taken
from
a
consummation
of
ills
which
would
have
reduced
them
to
a
misery
i
am
content
to
endure
alone
come
to
me
dear
somerset
to
look
on
you
to
press
you
in
my
arms
will
be
a
happiness
which
even
in
hope
makes
my
heart
throb
with
pleasure
i
will
remain
at
home
all
day
in
the
expectation
of
seeing
you
meanwhile
adieu
my
dear
somerset
you
will
find
at
no
martin
lane
your
ever
affectionate
thaddeus
constantine
count
sobieski
inquire
for
me
by
the
name
of
mr
constantine
footnote
the
humble
english
home
of
thaddeus
sobieski
is
now
totally
vanished
along
with
the
whole
row
of
houses
of
which
it
was
one
with
the
most
delightful
emotions
thaddeus
sealed
this
letter
and
gave
it
to
nanny
with
orders
to
inquire
at
the
when
he
might
expect
an
answer
the
child
returned
with
information
that
it
would
reach
grosvenor
square
in
an
hour
and
he
could
have
a
reply
by
three
three
arrived
and
no
letter
thaddeus
counted
the
hours
until
midnight
but
they
brought
him
nothing
but
disappointment
the
whole
of
the
succeeding
day
wore
away
in
the
same
uncomfortable
manner
his
heart
bounded
at
every
step
in
the
passage
and
throwing
open
his
he
listened
to
every
person
that
spoke
but
no
voice
bore
any
resemblance
to
that
of
somerset
night
again
shut
in
and
overcome
by
a
train
of
doubts
in
which
despondence
held
the
greatest
share
he
threw
himself
on
his
bed
though
unable
to
close
his
eyes
whatever
be
our
afflictions
not
one
human
creature
who
has
endured
misfortune
will
hesitate
to
aver
that
of
all
the
tortures
incident
to
mortality
there
are
none
like
the
rackings
of
suspense
it
is
the
hell
which
milton
describes
with
such
horrible
accuracy
in
its
hot
and
cold
regions
the
anxious
soul
is
alternately
tossed
from
the
ardors
of
hope
to
the
petrifying
rigors
of
doubt
and
dread
men
who
have
not
been
suspended
between
confidence
and
fear
in
their
judgment
of
a
beloved
friend
faithfulness
are
ignorant
of
the
nerve
whence
agonies
are
born
it
is
when
sunk
in
sorrow
when
adversity
loads
us
with
divers
miseries
and
our
wretchedness
is
completed
by
such
desertion
it
is
then
we
are
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
though
life
is
brief
there
are
few
friendships
which
have
strength
to
follow
it
to
the
end
but
how
precious
are
those
few
the
are
pearls
above
price
such
were
the
reflections
of
the
count
sobieski
when
he
arose
in
the
morning
from
his
sleepless
pillow
the
idea
that
the
letter
might
have
been
delayed
afforded
him
a
faint
hope
which
he
cherished
all
day
clinging
to
the
expectation
of
seeing
his
friend
before
sunset
but
somerset
did
not
appear
and
obliged
to
seek
an
excuse
for
his
absence
in
the
supposition
of
his
application
having
miscarried
thaddeus
determined
to
write
once
more
and
to
deliver
the
letter
himself
at
his
friend
door
accordingly
with
emotions
different
from
those
with
which
he
had
addressed
him
a
few
days
before
he
wrote
these
lines
to
pembroke
somerset
if
he
who
once
called
thaddeus
sobieski
his
friend
has
received
a
letter
which
that
exile
addressed
to
him
on
friday
last
this
note
will
meet
the
same
neglect
but
if
this
be
the
first
intelligence
that
tells
somerset
his
friend
is
in
town
perhaps
he
may
overlook
that
friend
change
of
fortune
he
may
visit
him
in
his
distress
who
will
receive
him
with
open
arms
at
his
humble
abode
in
martin
lane
sunday
evening
no
martin
lane
thaddeus
having
sealed
the
letter
walked
out
in
search
of
sir
robert
somerset
habitation
after
some
inquiries
he
found
grosvenor
square
and
amidst
the
darkness
of
the
night
was
guided
to
the
house
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
and
the
lustres
which
shone
through
the
open
windows
he
hesitated
a
few
minutes
on
the
pavement
and
looked
up
an
old
gentleman
was
standing
with
a
little
boy
at
the
nearest
window
whilst
the
count
eyes
were
fixed
on
these
two
figures
he
saw
somerset
himself
come
up
to
the
child
and
lead
it
away
towards
a
group
of
ladies
thaddeus
immediately
flew
to
the
door
with
a
tremor
over
his
frame
which
communicated
itself
to
the
knocker
for
he
knocked
with
such
violence
that
the
door
was
opened
in
an
instant
by
footmen
at
once
he
spoke
to
one
is
pembroke
somerset
at
home
yes
replied
the
man
who
saw
by
his
plain
dress
that
he
could
not
be
an
invited
guest
but
he
is
engaged
with
company
i
do
not
want
to
see
him
now
rejoined
the
count
only
give
him
that
letter
for
it
is
of
consequence
certainly
sir
replied
the
servant
and
thaddeus
instantly
withdrew
he
now
turned
homeward
with
his
mind
more
than
commonly
depressed
there
was
a
something
in
the
whole
affair
which
pierced
him
to
the
soul
he
had
seen
the
house
that
contained
the
man
he
most
warmly
loved
but
he
had
not
been
admitted
within
it
he
could
not
forbear
recollecting
that
when
his
gates
opened
wide
as
his
heart
to
welcome
pembroke
somerset
how
he
had
been
implored
by
his
then
grateful
friend
to
bring
the
palatine
and
the
countess
to
england
where
his
father
would
be
proud
to
entertain
them
as
the
preservers
of
his
son
how
different
from
these
professions
did
he
find
the
reality
instead
of
seeing
the
doors
widely
unclose
to
receive
him
he
was
allowed
to
stand
like
a
beggar
on
the
threshold
and
he
heard
them
shut
against
him
whilst
the
form
of
somerset
glided
above
him
even
as
the
shadow
of
his
buried
joys
these
discomforting
retrospections
on
the
past
and
painful
meditations
on
the
present
continued
to
occupy
his
mind
until
crossing
over
from
piccadilly
to
coventry
street
he
perceived
a
man
almost
bent
double
accosting
a
party
of
people
in
broken
french
and
imploring
their
charity
the
voice
and
the
accent
being
sclavonian
arrested
the
ear
of
thaddeus
drawing
close
to
the
man
as
the
party
proceeded
without
taking
notice
of
the
application
he
hastily
asked
are
you
a
polander
father
of
mercies
cried
the
beggar
catching
hold
of
his
hand
am
i
so
blessed
have
i
at
last
met
him
and
bursting
into
tears
he
leaned
upon
the
arm
of
the
count
who
hardly
able
to
articulate
with
surprise
exclaimed
dear
worthy
butzou
what
a
time
is
this
for
you
and
i
to
meet
but
come
you
must
go
home
with
me
willingly
my
dear
lord
returned
he
for
i
have
no
home
i
begged
my
way
from
harwich
to
this
town
and
have
already
spent
two
dismal
nights
in
the
streets
o
my
country
cried
the
full
heart
of
thaddeus
yes
continued
the
poor
old
soldier
it
received
its
death
wounds
when
kosciusko
and
my
honored
master
fell
thaddeus
could
not
reply
but
supporting
the
exhausted
frame
of
his
friend
who
was
hardly
able
to
walk
after
many
pauses
gladly
descried
his
own
door
the
widow
opened
it
the
moment
he
knocked
and
seeing
some
one
with
him
was
retreating
when
thaddeus
who
found
from
the
silence
of
butzou
that
he
was
faint
begged
her
to
allow
him
to
take
his
companion
into
her
parlor
she
instantly
made
way
and
the
count
placed
the
now
insensible
old
man
in
the
by
the
fire
he
is
my
friend
my
father
friend
cried
thaddeus
looking
at
his
pale
and
haggard
face
with
a
strange
wildness
in
his
own
features
for
heaven
sake
give
me
something
to
restore
him
robson
in
dismay
and
literally
having
nothing
better
in
the
house
gave
him
a
glass
of
water
that
will
not
do
exclaimed
he
still
upholding
the
motionless
body
on
his
arm
have
you
no
wine
no
anything
he
is
dying
for
want
none
sir
i
have
none
answered
she
frightened
at
the
violence
of
his
manner
run
nanny
and
borrow
something
warming
of
mrs
watts
or
cried
thaddeus
bring
me
a
bottle
of
wine
from
the
nearest
inn
as
he
spoke
he
threw
her
the
only
he
possessed
and
added
fly
for
he
may
die
in
a
moment
the
child
flew
like
lightning
to
the
golden
cross
and
brought
the
wine
just
as
butzou
had
opened
his
eyes
and
was
gazing
at
thaddeus
with
a
languid
agony
that
penetrated
his
soul
robson
held
the
water
to
his
lips
he
swallowed
a
little
then
feebly
articulated
i
am
perishing
for
want
of
food
thaddeus
had
caught
the
bottle
from
nanny
and
pouring
some
of
its
contents
into
a
glass
made
him
drink
it
this
draught
revived
him
a
little
he
raised
himself
in
his
seat
but
still
panting
and
speechless
leaned
his
swimming
head
upon
the
bosom
of
his
friend
who
knelt
by
his
side
whilst
robson
was
preparing
some
toasted
bread
with
a
little
more
heated
wine
which
was
fortunately
good
sherry
after
much
kind
exertion
between
the
good
landlady
and
the
count
they
sufficiently
recovered
the
poor
invalid
to
enable
them
to
support
him
up
stairs
to
lie
down
on
the
bed
the
drowsiness
usually
attendant
on
debility
aided
by
the
fumes
of
the
wine
threw
him
into
an
immediate
and
deep
sleep
thaddeus
seeing
him
at
rest
thought
it
proper
to
rejoin
robson
and
by
a
partial
history
of
his
friend
acquaint
her
with
the
occasion
of
the
foregoing
scene
he
found
the
good
woman
surprised
and
concerned
but
no
way
displeased
and
in
a
few
words
he
gave
her
a
summary
explanation
of
the
precipitancy
with
which
without
her
permission
he
had
introduced
a
stranger
under
her
roof
the
substance
of
what
he
said
related
that
the
person
up
stairs
had
served
with
him
in
the
army
that
on
the
ruin
of
his
country
which
he
could
no
longer
conceal
was
poland
the
venerable
man
had
come
in
quest
of
him
to
england
and
in
his
journey
had
sustained
misfortunes
which
had
reduced
him
to
the
state
she
saw
i
met
him
continued
he
forlorn
and
alone
in
the
street
and
whilst
he
lives
i
shall
hold
it
my
duty
to
protect
him
i
love
him
for
his
own
sake
and
i
honor
him
for
my
grandfather
besides
robson
cried
he
with
additional
energy
before
i
left
my
country
i
made
a
vow
to
my
sovereign
that
wherever
i
should
meet
this
brave
old
man
i
would
serve
him
to
the
last
hour
of
his
life
therefore
we
must
part
no
more
will
you
give
him
shelter
added
he
in
a
subdued
voice
will
you
allow
me
to
retain
him
in
my
apartments
willingly
sir
but
how
can
i
accommodate
him
he
is
already
in
your
bed
and
i
have
not
one
to
spare
leave
that
to
me
best
kindest
of
women
exclaimed
the
count
your
permission
has
rendered
me
happy
he
then
wished
her
a
good
night
and
returning
up
stairs
wrapped
himself
in
his
and
passed
the
night
by
the
little
fire
of
the
chapter
xviii
the
veteran
narrative
owing
to
comfortable
refreshment
and
a
night
of
undisturbed
sleep
general
butzou
awoke
in
the
morning
much
recovered
from
the
weakness
which
had
subdued
him
the
preceding
day
thaddeus
observed
this
change
with
pleasure
whilst
he
sat
by
his
bed
ministering
to
him
with
the
care
of
a
son
he
dwelt
with
a
melancholy
delight
on
his
revered
features
and
listened
to
his
languid
voice
with
those
tender
associations
which
are
dear
to
the
heart
though
they
pierce
it
with
regretful
anguish
tell
me
my
dear
general
said
he
for
i
can
bear
to
hear
it
now
tell
me
what
has
befallen
my
unhappy
country
since
i
quitted
it
every
calamity
cried
the
brave
old
man
shaking
his
head
that
tyranny
could
devise
well
go
on
returned
the
count
with
a
smile
which
truly
declared
that
the
composure
of
his
air
was
assumed
we
who
have
beheld
her
sufferings
and
yet
live
need
not
fear
hearing
them
described
did
you
see
the
king
before
he
left
warsaw
no
replied
butzou
our
oppressors
took
care
of
that
whilst
you
my
lord
were
recovering
from
your
wounds
in
the
citadel
i
set
off
for
sachoryn
to
join
prince
poniatowski
in
my
way
thither
i
met
some
soldiers
who
informed
me
that
his
highness
having
been
compelled
to
discharge
his
troops
was
returning
to
support
his
royal
brother
under
the
indignities
which
the
haughtiness
of
the
victor
might
premeditate
i
then
directed
my
steps
towards
sendomir
where
i
hoped
to
find
dombrowski
with
still
a
few
faithful
followers
but
here
too
i
was
disappointed
two
days
before
my
arrival
that
general
according
to
orders
had
disbanded
his
whole
party
footnote
dombrowski
withdrew
into
france
where
he
was
soon
joined
by
others
of
his
countrymen
which
little
band
in
process
of
time
by
gradual
accession
of
numbers
became
what
was
afterwards
styled
the
celebrated
polish
legion
in
the
days
of
napoleon
at
the
head
of
which
legion
the
prince
poniatowski
so
often
mentioned
in
these
pages
lost
his
life
in
the
fatal
frontier
river
his
dauntless
courage
dared
to
swim
his
remains
were
taken
to
cracow
and
buried
near
to
the
tomb
of
john
sobieski
i
now
found
that
poland
was
completely
in
the
hands
of
her
ravagers
and
yet
i
prepared
to
return
into
her
bosom
my
feet
naturally
took
that
course
but
i
was
agonized
at
every
step
i
retrod
i
beheld
the
shores
of
the
vistula
lined
on
every
side
with
the
allied
troops
ten
thousand
were
posted
on
her
banks
and
eighteen
thousand
amongst
the
ruins
of
praga
and
villanow
when
i
approached
the
walls
of
warsaw
imagine
my
dear
lord
how
great
was
my
indignation
how
barbarous
the
conduct
of
our
enemies
batteries
of
cannon
were
erected
around
the
city
to
level
it
with
the
ground
on
the
smallest
murmur
of
discontent
on
the
morning
of
my
arrival
i
was
hastening
to
the
palace
to
pay
my
duty
to
the
king
when
a
cossack
officer
intercepted
me
whom
i
formerly
knew
and
indeed
kindly
warned
me
that
if
i
attempted
to
pass
my
obstinacy
would
be
fatal
to
myself
and
hazardous
to
his
majesty
whose
confinement
and
suffering
were
augmented
in
proportion
to
the
adherents
he
retained
amongst
the
poles
hearing
this
i
was
turning
away
overwhelmed
with
grief
when
the
doors
of
the
audience
chamber
opened
and
the
counts
potocki
kilinski
and
several
others
of
your
grandfather
dearest
friends
were
led
forth
under
a
guard
i
was
standing
motionless
with
surprise
when
potocki
perceiving
me
held
forth
his
hand
i
took
it
and
wringing
it
in
the
bitterness
of
my
heart
uttered
some
words
which
i
can
not
remember
but
my
cossack
friend
whispered
me
to
beware
how
i
again
gave
way
to
such
dangerous
remarks
my
worthy
general
said
potocki
in
a
low
voice
see
we
are
arrested
we
loved
poland
too
faithfully
for
her
enemies
and
for
that
reason
we
are
to
be
sent
prisoners
to
petersburg
sharing
the
fate
of
kosciusko
our
chains
are
our
distinction
such
a
collar
of
merit
is
the
most
glorious
order
which
the
imperial
sceptre
could
bestow
on
a
knight
of
st
stanislaus
i
can
not
admit
of
this
conversation
cried
the
officer
of
the
guard
and
commanding
the
escort
to
proceed
i
lost
sight
of
these
illustrious
patriots
probably
forever
footnote
the
potocki
family
at
that
time
had
still
large
possessions
in
the
crimean
country
of
the
cossacks
for
it
had
formerly
belonged
to
the
crown
of
poland
and
hence
a
kind
of
kindred
memory
lingered
amongst
the
people
not
disaffecting
them
from
their
new
masters
but
allowing
a
natural
respect
for
the
descendants
of
the
old
i
understood
from
the
few
poles
who
remained
in
the
citadel
that
the
good
stanislaus
was
to
be
sent
on
the
same
dismal
errand
of
captivity
to
grodno
the
next
day
they
also
told
me
that
poland
being
no
more
you
had
torn
yourself
from
its
bleeding
remains
rather
than
behold
the
triumphant
entry
of
its
conqueror
this
insulting
pageant
was
performed
on
the
of
november
last
on
the
i
believe
you
left
warsaw
for
england
yes
replied
the
count
who
had
listened
with
a
breaking
heart
to
this
distressing
narrative
and
doubtless
i
saved
myself
much
misery
you
did
one
of
the
magistrates
described
to
me
the
whole
scene
at
which
i
would
not
have
been
present
for
the
world
empire
he
told
me
that
when
the
morning
arrived
in
which
general
suwarrow
attended
by
the
confederated
envoys
was
to
make
his
public
not
a
citizen
could
be
seen
that
was
not
compelled
to
appear
a
dead
silence
reigned
in
the
streets
the
doors
and
windows
of
every
house
remained
so
closed
that
a
stranger
might
have
supposed
it
to
be
a
general
mourning
and
it
was
the
bitterest
sight
which
could
have
fallen
upon
our
souls
at
this
moment
when
warsaw
i
may
say
lay
dying
at
the
feet
of
her
conqueror
the
foreign
troops
marched
into
the
city
the
only
spectators
of
their
own
horrible
tragedy
at
length
with
eyes
which
could
no
longer
weep
the
magistrates
reluctant
and
full
of
indignation
proceeded
to
meet
the
victor
on
the
bridge
of
praga
when
they
came
near
the
procession
they
presented
the
keys
of
warsaw
on
their
knees
on
their
knees
interrupted
thaddeus
starting
up
and
the
blood
flushing
over
his
face
yes
answered
butzou
on
their
knees
almighty
justice
exclaimed
the
count
pacing
the
room
with
emotion
why
did
not
the
earth
open
and
swallow
them
why
did
not
the
blood
which
saturated
the
spot
whereon
they
knelt
cry
out
to
them
o
butzou
this
humiliation
of
poland
is
worse
to
me
than
all
her
miseries
i
felt
as
you
feel
my
lord
continued
the
general
and
i
expressed
myself
with
the
same
resentment
but
the
magistrate
who
related
to
me
that
circumstance
urged
in
excuse
for
himself
and
his
brethren
that
such
a
form
was
necessary
and
had
they
refused
probably
their
lives
would
have
been
forfeited
well
inquired
thaddeus
resuming
his
seat
but
where
was
the
king
during
this
transaction
in
the
castle
where
he
received
orders
to
be
present
next
day
at
a
public
thanksgiving
at
which
the
inhabitants
of
warsaw
were
also
commanded
to
attend
to
perform
a
in
gratitude
for
the
destruction
of
their
country
thank
heaven
i
was
spared
from
witnessing
this
blasphemy
i
was
then
at
sendomir
but
the
day
after
i
had
heard
of
it
i
saw
the
carriage
which
contained
the
good
stanislaus
guarded
like
a
traitor
out
of
the
gates
and
that
very
hour
i
left
the
city
i
made
my
way
to
hamburgh
where
i
took
a
passage
to
harwich
but
when
there
owing
to
excessive
fatigue
one
of
my
old
wounds
broke
out
afresh
and
continuing
ill
a
week
i
expended
all
my
money
reduced
to
my
last
shilling
and
eager
to
find
you
i
begged
my
way
from
that
town
to
this
i
had
already
spent
two
miserable
days
and
nights
in
the
open
air
with
no
other
sustenance
than
the
casual
charity
of
passengers
when
heaven
sent
you
my
honored
sobieski
to
save
me
from
perishing
in
the
streets
butzou
pressed
the
hand
of
his
young
friend
as
he
concluded
indignation
still
kept
its
station
on
the
count
features
the
poor
expatriated
wanderer
observed
it
with
satisfaction
well
pleased
that
this
strong
emotion
at
the
supposed
pusillanimity
of
his
countrymen
had
prevented
those
bursts
of
grief
which
might
have
been
expected
from
his
sensitive
nature
when
informed
that
ruined
poland
was
not
only
treated
by
its
ravagers
like
a
slave
but
loaded
with
the
shackles
and
usage
of
a
criminal
towards
evening
general
butzou
fell
asleep
thaddeus
leaning
back
in
his
chair
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
fire
and
mused
with
amazement
and
sorrow
on
what
had
been
told
him
when
it
was
almost
dark
and
he
was
yet
lost
in
reflection
robson
gently
opened
the
door
and
presented
a
letter
here
sir
said
she
is
a
letter
which
a
servant
has
just
left
he
told
me
it
required
no
answer
thaddeus
sprang
from
his
seat
at
sight
of
the
paper
and
almost
catching
it
from
her
his
former
gloomy
cogitations
dispersed
before
the
hopes
and
fond
emotions
of
friendship
which
now
lit
up
in
his
bosom
robson
withdrew
he
looked
at
the
superscription
it
was
the
handwriting
of
his
friend
tearing
it
asunder
two
folded
papers
presented
themselves
he
opened
them
and
they
were
his
own
letters
returned
without
a
word
his
beating
heart
was
suddenly
checked
letting
the
papers
fall
from
his
hand
he
dropped
back
on
his
seat
and
closed
his
eyes
as
if
he
would
shut
them
from
the
world
and
its
ingratitude
unable
to
recover
from
his
astonishment
his
thoughts
whirled
about
in
a
succession
of
accusations
surmises
and
doubts
which
seemed
for
a
few
minutes
to
drive
him
to
distraction
was
it
really
the
hand
of
somerset
again
he
examined
the
envelope
it
was
and
the
enclosures
were
his
own
letters
without
one
word
of
apology
for
such
incomprehensible
conduct
could
he
make
one
no
replied
thaddeus
to
himself
unhappy
that
i
am
to
have
been
induced
to
apply
twice
to
so
despicable
a
man
oh
somerset
cried
he
looking
at
the
papers
as
they
lay
before
him
was
it
necessary
that
insult
should
be
added
to
unfaithfulness
and
ingratitude
to
throw
me
off
entirely
good
heavens
did
he
think
because
i
wrote
twice
i
would
persecute
him
with
applications
i
have
been
told
this
of
mankind
but
that
i
should
find
it
in
him
in
this
way
agitated
and
muttering
and
walking
up
and
down
the
room
he
spent
another
wakeful
and
cheerless
night
when
he
went
down
stairs
next
morning
to
beg
robson
to
attend
his
friend
until
his
return
she
mentioned
how
uneasy
she
was
at
having
heard
him
most
of
the
preceding
night
moving
above
her
head
he
was
trying
to
account
to
her
for
his
restlessness
by
complaining
of
a
headache
but
she
interrupted
him
by
saying
o
no
sir
i
am
sure
it
is
the
hard
boards
you
lie
on
to
accommodate
the
poor
old
gentleman
i
am
certain
you
will
make
yourself
thaddeus
thanked
her
for
her
solicitude
but
declaring
that
all
beds
hard
or
soft
were
alike
to
him
he
left
her
more
reconciled
to
his
pallet
on
the
floor
and
with
his
drawings
in
his
pocket
once
more
took
the
path
to
great
newport
street
resentment
against
his
fickle
friend
and
anxiety
for
the
tranquillity
of
general
butzou
whose
age
infirmities
and
sufferings
threatened
a
speedy
termination
of
his
life
determined
the
count
to
sacrifice
all
false
delicacy
and
morbid
feelings
and
to
hazard
another
attempt
at
acquiring
the
means
of
affording
those
comforts
to
the
sick
veteran
which
his
condition
demanded
happen
how
it
would
he
resolved
that
butzou
should
never
know
the
complete
wreck
of
his
property
i
shuddered
at
loading
him
with
the
additional
distress
of
thinking
he
was
a
burden
on
his
protector
thaddeus
passed
the
door
of
the
printseller
who
had
behaved
so
ill
to
him
on
his
first
application
and
walking
to
the
farthest
shop
on
the
same
side
entered
it
laying
his
drawings
on
the
counter
he
requested
the
person
who
stood
there
to
look
at
them
they
were
immediately
opened
and
the
count
dreading
a
second
repulse
or
even
more
than
similar
insolence
hastily
added
they
are
scenes
in
germany
if
you
like
to
have
them
their
price
is
a
guinea
are
you
the
painter
sir
was
the
reply
yes
sir
do
they
please
you
yes
answered
the
tradesman
for
it
was
the
master
examining
them
nearer
there
is
a
breadth
and
freedom
in
the
style
which
is
novel
and
may
take
i
will
give
you
your
demand
and
he
laid
the
money
on
the
counter
rejoiced
that
he
had
succeeded
where
he
had
entertained
no
hope
thaddeus
with
a
bow
was
leaving
the
shop
when
the
man
called
after
him
stay
sir
he
returned
prepared
to
now
hear
some
disparaging
remark
it
is
strange
but
it
is
true
that
those
who
have
been
thrust
by
misfortune
into
a
state
beneath
their
birth
and
expectations
too
often
consider
themselves
the
objects
of
universal
hostility
they
see
contempt
in
every
eye
they
suppose
insult
in
every
word
the
slightest
neglect
is
sufficient
to
set
the
sensitive
pride
of
the
unfortunate
in
a
blaze
and
alas
how
little
is
this
sensibility
respected
by
the
rich
and
gay
in
their
dealings
with
the
unhappy
to
what
an
addition
of
misery
are
the
wretched
exposed
meeting
not
only
those
contumelies
which
the
prosperous
are
not
backward
to
bestow
but
those
fancied
ills
which
however
unfounded
keep
the
mind
in
a
feverish
struggle
with
itself
and
an
uttered
warfare
with
the
surrounding
world
repeated
insults
infused
into
the
mind
of
sobieski
much
of
this
anticipating
irritability
and
it
was
with
a
very
haughty
step
that
he
turned
back
to
hear
what
the
printseller
meant
to
say
i
only
want
to
ask
whether
you
follow
this
art
as
a
profession
yes
then
i
shall
be
glad
if
you
can
furnish
me
with
six
such
drawings
every
week
certainly
replied
thaddeus
pleased
with
the
probability
thus
securing
something
towards
the
support
of
his
friend
then
bring
me
another
next
monday
thaddeus
promised
and
with
a
relieved
mind
took
his
way
homeward
who
is
there
in
england
i
repeat
who
does
not
remember
the
dreadfully
protracted
winter
of
when
the
whole
country
lay
buried
in
a
thick
ice
which
seemed
eternal
over
that
ice
and
through
those
snows
the
venerable
general
butzou
had
begged
his
way
from
harwich
to
london
he
rested
at
night
under
the
shelter
of
some
shed
or
outhouse
and
cooled
his
feverish
thirst
with
a
little
water
taken
from
under
the
broken
ice
which
locked
up
the
springs
the
effect
of
this
was
a
painful
rheumatism
which
fixed
itself
in
his
limbs
and
soon
rendered
them
nearly
useless
two
or
three
weeks
passed
over
the
heads
of
the
general
and
his
young
protector
thaddeus
cheering
the
old
man
with
his
smiles
and
he
in
return
imparting
the
only
pleasure
to
him
which
his
melancholy
heart
could
receive
the
conviction
that
his
attentions
and
affection
were
productive
of
comfort
in
the
exercise
of
these
duties
the
count
not
only
found
his
health
gradually
recover
its
tone
but
his
mind
became
more
tranquil
and
less
prone
to
those
sudden
floods
of
regret
which
were
rapidly
sapping
his
life
by
a
strict
economy
on
his
part
he
managed
to
pay
the
widow
and
support
his
friend
out
of
the
weekly
profits
of
his
drawings
which
were
now
and
then
augmented
by
a
commission
to
do
one
or
two
more
than
the
stipulated
number
thus
conversing
with
butzou
reading
to
him
when
awake
or
pursuing
his
drawings
when
he
slept
thaddeus
spent
the
time
until
the
beginning
of
march
one
fine
starlight
evening
in
that
month
just
before
the
frost
broke
up
after
painting
all
day
he
desired
little
nanny
to
take
care
of
the
general
and
leaving
his
work
at
the
printseller
he
then
proceeded
through
piccadilly
intending
to
go
as
far
as
hyde
park
corner
and
return
pleased
with
the
beauty
of
the
night
he
walked
on
not
remarking
that
he
had
passed
the
turnpike
until
he
heard
a
scream
the
sound
came
from
near
the
park
wall
he
hurried
along
and
at
a
short
distance
perceived
a
woman
struggling
with
a
man
who
was
assaulting
her
in
a
very
offensive
manner
without
a
moment
hesitation
with
one
blow
of
his
arm
thaddeus
sent
the
fellow
reeling
against
the
wall
but
while
he
supported
the
outraged
person
who
seemed
fainting
the
man
recovered
himself
and
rushing
on
her
champion
aimed
a
stroke
at
his
head
with
an
immense
bludgeon
which
the
count
catching
hold
of
as
it
descended
wrenched
out
of
his
hand
the
horrid
oaths
of
the
ruffian
and
the
sobs
of
his
rescued
victim
collected
a
mob
and
then
the
villain
fearing
worse
usage
made
off
and
left
thaddeus
to
restore
the
terrified
female
at
his
leisure
as
soon
as
she
was
able
to
speak
she
thanked
her
deliverer
in
a
voice
and
language
that
assured
him
it
was
no
common
person
he
had
befriended
but
in
the
circumstance
of
her
distress
all
would
have
been
the
same
to
him
a
helpless
woman
was
insulted
and
whatever
her
rank
might
be
he
thought
she
had
an
equal
claim
on
his
protection
the
mob
dispersed
and
finding
the
lady
capable
of
walking
he
begged
permission
to
see
her
safe
home
i
thank
you
sir
she
replied
and
i
accept
your
offer
with
gratitude
besides
after
your
generous
interference
it
is
requisite
that
i
should
account
to
you
how
a
woman
of
my
appearance
came
out
at
this
hour
without
attendance
i
have
no
other
excuse
to
advance
for
such
imprudence
than
that
i
have
often
done
so
with
impunity
i
have
a
friend
whose
husband
being
in
the
lives
near
the
barracks
we
often
drink
tea
with
each
other
sometimes
my
servants
come
for
me
and
sometimes
when
i
am
wearied
and
indisposed
i
come
away
earlier
and
alone
this
happened
and
i
have
to
thank
your
gallantry
sir
for
my
rescue
from
the
first
outrage
of
the
kind
which
ever
assailed
me
by
the
time
that
a
few
more
complimentary
words
on
her
side
and
a
modest
reply
from
thaddeus
had
passed
they
stopped
before
a
house
in
grosvenor
place
footnote
all
this
local
scenery
is
changed
there
is
no
turnpike
gate
now
at
the
hyde
park
end
of
piccadilly
neither

a

splendid

wayfaring
english
the
lady
knocked
at
the
door
and
as
soon
as
it
was
opened
the
count
was
taking
his
leave
but
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
said
in
a
voice
of
sincere
invitation
no
sir
i
must
not
lose
the
opportunity
of
convincing
you
that
you
have
not
succored
a
person
unworthy
of
your
kindness
i
entreat
you
to
walk
in
thaddeus
was
too
much
pleased
with
her
manner
not
to
accept
this
courtesy
he
followed
her
up
stairs
into
a
where
a
young
lady
was
seated
at
work
miss
egerton
cried
his
conductress
here
is
a
gentleman
who
has
this
moment
saved
me
from
a
ruffian
you
must
assist
me
to
express
my
gratitude
i
would
with
all
my
heart
returned
she
but
your
ladyship
confers
benefits
so
well
you
can
not
be
at
a
loss
how
to
receive
them
thaddeus
took
the
chair
which
a
servant
set
for
him
and
with
mingled
pleasure
and
admiration
turned
his
eyes
on
the
lovely
woman
he
had
rescued
she
had
thrown
off
her
cloak
and
veil
and
displayed
a
figure
and
countenance
full
of
dignity
and
interest
she
begged
him
to
lay
aside
his
for
she
must
insist
upon
his
supping
with
her
there
was
a
commanding
softness
in
her
manner
and
a
gentle
yet
unappealable
decision
in
her
voice
he
could
not
withstand
and
he
prepared
to
obey
although
he
was
aware
the
fashion
and
richness
of
the
military
dress
concealed
under
his
coat
would
give
her
ideas
of
his
situation
he
could
not
answer
the
lady
did
not
notice
his
hesitation
but
ringing
the
bell
desired
the
servant
to
take
the
gentleman
hat
and
coat
thaddeus
instantly
saw
in
the
looks
of
both
the
ladies
what
he
feared
i
perceive
said
the
elder
as
she
took
her
seat
that
my
deliverer
is
in
the
army
yet
i
do
not
recollect
having
seen
that
uniform
before
i
am
not
an
englishman
returned
he
not
an
englishman
exclaimed
miss
egerton
and
speak
the
language
so
accurately
you
can
not
be
french
no
madam
i
had
the
honor
of
serving
under
the
king
of
poland
then
his
was
a
very
gallant
court
i
suppose
rejoined
miss
egerton
with
a
smile
for
i
am
sorry
to
say
there
are
few
about
james
who
would
have
taken
the
trouble
to
do
what
you
have
done
by
lady
tinemouth
he
returned
the
young
lady
smile
i
have
seen
too
little
madam
of
englishmen
of
rank
to
show
any
gallantry
in
defending
this
part
of
my
sex
against
so
fair
an
accuser
indeed
he
recollected
the
officers
in
the
park
and
the
perfidy
of
somerset
and
thought
he
had
no
reason
to
give
them
more
respect
than
their
countrywomen
manifested
come
come
sophia
cried
lady
tinemouth
though
no
woman
has
less
cause
to
speak
well
of
mankind
than
i
have
i
will
not
permit
my
countrymen
to
be
run
down
i
dare
say
this
gentleman
will
agree
with
me
that
it
shows
neither
a
candid
nor
a
patriotic
spirit
her
ladyship
uttered
this
little
rebuke
smilingly
i
dare
say
he
will
not
agree
with
you
lady
tinemouth
no
gentleman
yet
who
had
his
wits
about
him
ever
agreed
with
an
elder
lady
against
a
younger
now
mr
gentleman
for
it
seems
the
name
by
which
we
are
to
address
you
what
do
you
say
am
i
so
very
reprobate
thaddeus
almost
laughed
at
the
singular
way
she
had
chosen
to
ask
his
name
and
allowing
some
of
the
gloom
which
generally
obscured
his
fine
eyes
to
disperse
he
answered
with
a
smile
my
name
is
constantine
well
you
have
replied
to
my
last
question
first
but
i
will
not
let
you
off
about
my
sometimes
bearish
countrymen
i
do
assure
you
the
race
of
the
raleighs
with
their
footstep
cloaks
is
quite
de
and
so
do
you
think
constantine
i
may
call
them
so
without
any
breach
of
good
manners
to
them
or
duty
to
my
country
for
you
see
her
ladyship
hangs
much
upon
a
spinster
patriotism
lady
tinemouth
shook
her
head
o
sophia
sophia
you
are
a
strange
i
do
care
for
that
i
will
have
constantine
unprejudiced
reply
i
am
sure
if
he
had
taken
as
long
a
time
in
answering
your
call
as
he
does
mine
the
ruffian
might
have
killed
and
eaten
you
too
before
he
moved
to
your
assistance
come
may
i
not
say
they
are
anything
but
men
certainly
a
fair
lady
may
say
anything
positively
constantine
i
wo
endure
contempt
say
such
another
word
and
i
will
call
you
as
abominable
a
creature
as
the
worst
of
them
but
i
am
not
a
proper
judge
miss
egerton
i
have
never
been
in
company
with
any
of
these
men
so
to
be
impartial
i
must
suspend
my
opinion
and
not
believe
my
word
thaddeus
smiled
and
bowed
there
lady
tinemouth
cried
she
affecting
pet
take
your
champion
to
yourself
he
is
no
for
me
thank
you
sophia
returned
her
ladyship
giving
her
hand
to
the
count
to
lead
her
to
the
this
is
the
way
she
skirmishes
with
all
your
sex
until
her
shrewd
humor
transforms
them
to
its
own
likeness
and
where
is
the
man
observed
thaddeus
who
would
not
be
so
metamorphosed
under
the
spells
of
such
a
circe
it
wo
do
constantine
cried
she
taking
her
place
opposite
to
him
my
anger
is
not
to
be
appeased
by
calling
me
names
you
do
mend
the
compliment
by
likening
me
to
a
heathen
and
a
witch
lady
tinemouth
bore
her
part
in
the
conversation
in
a
strain
more
in
unison
with
the
count
mind
however
he
found
no
inconsiderable
degree
of
amusement
from
the
unreflecting
volubility
and
giddy
sallies
of
her
friend
and
on
the
whole
spent
the
two
hours
he
passed
there
with
some
perceptions
of
his
almost
forgotten
sense
of
pleasure
he
was
in
an
elegant
apartment
in
the
company
of
two
lovely
and
accomplished
women
and
he
was
the
object
of
their
entire
attention
and
gratitude
he
had
been
used
to
this
in
his
days
of
happiness
when
he
was
the
expectancy
and
rose
of
the
fair
state
the
glass
of
fashion
and
the
mould
of
form
the
observed
of
all
observers
and
the
of
such
a
scene
awakened
with
tender
remembrances
an
associating
sensibility
which
made
him
rise
with
regret
when
the
clock
struck
eleven
lady
tinemouth
bade
him
with
an
earnest
request
that
he
would
shortly
repeat
his
visit
and
they
parted
mutually
pleased
with
each
other
chapter
xix
friendship
a
staff
in
human
life
pleased
as
the
count
was
with
the
acquaintance
to
which
his
gallantry
had
introduced
him
he
did
not
repeat
his
visit
for
a
long
time
a
few
mornings
after
his
meeting
with
lady
tinemouth
the
hard
frost
broke
up
the
change
in
the
atmosphere
produced
so
alarming
a
relapse
of
the
general
rheumatic
fever
that
his
friend
watched
by
his
pillow
ten
days
and
nights
at
the
end
of
this
period
he
recovered
sufficiently
to
sit
up
and
read
or
to
amuse
himself
by
registering
the
melancholy
events
of
the
last
campaigns
in
a
large
book
and
illustrating
it
with
plans
of
the
battles
the
sight
of
this
volume
would
have
distressed
thaddeus
had
he
not
seen
that
it
afforded
comfort
to
the
poor
veteran
whom
it
transported
back
into
the
scenes
on
which
he
delighted
to
dwell
yet
he
would
often
lay
down
his
pen
shut
the
book
and
weep
like
an
infant
the
count
left
him
one
morning
at
his
employment
and
strolled
out
with
the
intention
of
calling
on
lady
tinemouth
as
he
walked
along
by
burlington
house
he
perceived
pembroke
somerset
with
an
elderly
gentleman
of
a
very
distinguished
air
leaning
on
his
arm
they
approached
him
from
bond
street
all
the
blood
in
the
count
body
seemed
rushing
to
his
heart
he
trembled
the
ingenuous
smile
on
his
friend
countenance
and
his
features
so
sweetly
marked
with
frankness
made
his
resolution
falter
but
proofs
cried
he
to
himself
are
absolute
and
turning
his
face
to
a
stand
of
books
that
was
near
him
he
stood
there
until
somerset
had
passed
he
went
past
him
speaking
these
words
i
trust
father
that
ingratitude
is
not
his
vice
but
it
is
yours
somerset
murmured
thaddeus
while
for
a
moment
he
gazed
after
them
and
then
proceeded
on
his
walk
when
his
name
was
announced
at
lady
tinemouth
he
found
her
with
another
lady
but
not
miss
egerton
lady
tinemouth
expressed
her
pleasure
at
this
visit
and
her
surprise
that
it
had
been
so
long
deferred
the
pain
of
such
an
apparent
neglect
of
your
ladyship
goodness
replied
he
has
been
added
to
my
anxiety
for
the
declining
health
of
a
friend
whose
increased
illness
is
my
apology
i
wish
returned
her
ladyship
her
eyes
beaming
approbation
that
all
my
friends
could
excuse
their
absence
so
well
perhaps
they
might
if
they
chose
observed
the
other
lady
and
with
equal
sincerity
thaddeus
understood
the
incredulity
couched
under
these
words
so
did
lady
tinemouth
who
however
rejoined
be
satisfied
constantine
that
i
believe
you
the
count
bowed
fie
lady
tinemouth
cried
the
lady
you
are
partial
nay
you
are
absurd
did
you
ever
yet
hear
a
man
speak
truth
to
a
woman
lady
sara
replied
her
ladyship
with
one
of
those
arch
glances
which
seldom
visited
her
eyes
where
will
be
your
vanity
if
i
assent
to
this
in
the
moon
with
man
sincerity
thaddeus
paid
little
attention
to
this
dialogue
his
thoughts
in
spite
of
himself
were
wandering
after
the
figures
of
somerset
and
his
father
lady
tinemouth
whose
fancy
had
not
been
quiet
about
him
since
his
prompt
humanity
had
introduced
him
to
her
acquaintance
observed
his
present
absence
without
noticing
it
indeed
the
fruitful
imagination
of
sophia
egerton
had
not
lain
still
she
declared
he
was
a
soldier
by
his
dress
a
man
of
rank
from
his
manners
an
apollo
in
his
person
and
a
hero
from
his
gallantry
thus
had
miss
egerton
described
him
to
lady
sara
ross
and
added
she
what
convinces
me
he
is
a
man
of
fashion
he
has
not
been
within
these
walls
since
we
told
him
we
should
take
it
as
a
favor
lady
sara
was
eager
to
see
this
handsome
stranger
and
having
determined
to
drop
in
at
lady
tinemouth
every
morning
until
her
curiosity
was
gratified
she
was
not
a
little
pleased
when
she
heard
his
name
announced
lady
sara
was
married
but
she
was
young
and
of
great
beauty
and
she
liked
that
its
power
should
be
acknowledged
by
others
besides
her
husband
the
instant
she
beheld
the
count
sobieski
she
formed
the
wish
to
entangle
him
in
her
flowery
chains
she
learnt
by
his
pale
countenance
and
thoughtful
air
that
he
was
a
melancholy
character
and
above
all
things
she
sighed
for
such
a
lover
she
expected
to
receive
from
one
of
his
cast
a
rare
tenderness
and
devotedness
in
short
a
fervent
and
romantic
passion
the
fashion
of
the
day
ever
since
the
extravagant
french
romances
such
as
delphine
and
the
like
came
in
and
this
unknown
foreigner
appeared
to
her
to
be
the
very
creature
of
whom
her
fancy
had
been
in
search
his
abstraction
his
voice
and
eyes
the
one
so
touching
and
the
other
so
neglectful
of
anything
but
the
ground
were
irresistible
and
she
resolved
from
that
moment
in
her
own
words
to
make
a
set
at
him
not
less
pleased
with
this
second
view
of
her
acquaintance
than
she
had
been
at
the
first
lady
tinemouth
directed
her
discourse
to
him
accompanied
by
all
that
winning
interest
so
endearing
to
an
ingenuous
heart
lady
sara
never
augured
well
to
the
success
of
her
fascinations
when
the
countess
addressed
any
of
her
victims
and
therefore
she
now
tried
every
means
in
her
power
to
draw
aside
the
attention
of
the
count
she
played
with
her
ladyship
dog
but
that
not
succeeding
she
determined
to
strike
him
at
once
with
the
full
graces
of
her
figure
complaining
of
heat
she
threw
off
her
large
green
velvet
mantle
and
rising
from
her
chair
walked
towards
the
window
when
she
looked
round
to
enjoy
her
victory
she
saw
that
this
manoeuvre
had
failed
like
the
rest
for
the
provoking
countess
was
still
standing
between
her
and
thaddeus
almost
angry
she
flung
open
the
sash
and
putting
her
head
out
of
the
window
exclaimed
in
her
tones
how
d
do
i
hope
your
ladyship
is
well
this
fine
morning
was
answered
in
the
voice
of
pembroke
somerset
thaddeus
grew
pale
and
the
countess
feeling
the
cold
turned
about
to
ask
lady
sara
to
whom
she
was
speaking
to
a
pest
of
mine
returned
she
gayly
and
then
stretching
out
her
neck
resumed
but
where
in
the
name
of
wonder
somerset
are
you
driving
with
all
that
travelling
apparatus
to
deerhurst
i
am
going
to
take
lord
avon
down
but
i
keep
you
in
the
cold
my
compliments
to
sir
robert
waving
her
white
hand
until
his
curricle
vanished
from
sight
and
when
she
turned
round
her
desires
were
gratified
for
the
elegant
stranger
was
standing
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
that
hand
but
had
she
known
that
for
any
cognizance
they
took
of
its
beauty
they
might
as
well
have
been
fixed
on
vacancy
she
would
not
have
pulled
down
the
window
and
reseated
herself
with
such
an
air
of
triumph
the
count
took
his
seat
with
a
sigh
and
lady
tinemouth
did
the
same
so
that
is
the
son
of
sir
robert
somerset
yes
replied
lady
sara
and
what
does
your
ladyship
think
of
him
he
is
called
very
handsome
you
forget
that
i
am
answered
the
countess
i
could
not
discriminate
his
features
but
i
think
his
figure
fine
i
remember
his
father
was
a
man
and
celebrated
for
taste
and
talents
that
may
be
resumed
lady
sara
laughing
and
anxious
to
excite
some
emotion
of
rivalry
in
the
breast
of
thaddeus
i
am
sure
i
ought
not
to
call
in
question
his
talents
and
taste
for
he
has
often
wished
that
fate
had
reserved
me
for
his
son
she
sighed
while
she
spoke
and
looked
down
this
sigh
and
gesture
had
more
effect
upon
her
victim
than
all
her
exhibited
personal
charms
so
difficult
is
it
to
break
the
cords
of
affection
and
habit
anything
relating
to
pembroke
somerset
could
yet
so
powerfully
interest
the
desolate
yet
generous
sobieski
as
to
stamp
itself
on
his
features
besides
the
appearance
of
any
latent
disquietude
where
all
seemed
splendor
and
vivacity
painfully
reminded
him
of
the
checkered
lot
of
man
his
eyes
were
resting
upon
her
ladyship
full
of
a
tender
commiseration
pregnant
with
compassion
for
her
himself
and
all
the
world
when
she
raised
her
head
the
meeting
of
such
a
look
from
him
filled
her
with
agitation
she
felt
something
strange
at
her
heart
his
eyes
seemed
to
have
penetrated
to
its
inmost
devices
blushing
like
scarlet
she
got
up
to
hide
an
embarrassment
not
to
be
subdued
and
hastily
wishing
the
countess
a
curtseyed
to
him
and
left
the
room
her
ladyship
entered
her
carriage
with
feelings
all
in
commotion
she
could
not
account
for
the
confusion
which
his
look
had
occasioned
and
half
angry
at
a
weakness
so
like
a
raw
inexperienced
girl
she
determined
to
become
one
of
lady
tinemouth
constant
visitors
until
she
should
have
brought
him
as
she
had
done
most
of
the
men
in
her
circle
to
her
feet
these
were
her
ladyship
resolutions
while
she
rolled
along
towards
james
place
but
she
a
little
exceeded
the
fact
in
the
statement
of
her
conquests
for
notwithstanding
she
could
have
counted
as
many
lovers
as
most
women
yet
few
of
them
would
have
ventured
the
folly
of
a
kneeling
petition
in
spite
of
her
former
unwedded
charms
these
worthy
lords
and
gentlemen
had
to
a
man
adopted
the
oracle
of
the
poet
love
free
as
air
at
sight
of
human
ties
spreads
his
light
wings
and
in
a
moment
flies
they
all
professed
to
adore
lady
sara
some
were
caught
by
her
beauty
others
by
her
but
none
had
the
most
distant
wish
to
make
this
beauty
and
his
own
legal
property
for
she
had
no
other
property
to
bestow
the
young
marquis
of
severn
seemed
serious
towards
her
ladyship
during
the
first
year
of
his
appearance
at
court
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
instead
of
offering
her
his
hand
he
married
the
daughter
of
a
rich
banker
lady
sara
was
so
incensed
at
this
disappointment
that
to
show
her
disdain
of
her
apostate
lover
she
set
off
next
day
for
gretna
green
with
horace
ross
a
young
and
early
celebrated
commander
in
the
navy
whose
honest
heart
had
been
some
time
sueing
to
her
in
vain
he
was
also
nephew
to
the
earl
of
wintown
they
were
married
and
her
ladyship
had
the
triumph
of
being
presented
as
a
bride
the
same
day
with
the
marchioness
of
severn
when
the
whirlwind
of
her
resentment
subsided
she
began
most
dismally
to
repent
her
union
she
loved
captain
ross
as
little
as
she
had
loved
lord
severn
she
had
admired
the
rank
and
fashion
of
the
one
and
the
profound
adoration
of
the
other
had
made
a
friend
of
her
vanity
but
now
that
her
revenge
was
gratified
and
the
homage
of
a
husband
ceased
to
excite
the
envy
of
her
companions
she
grew
weary
of
his
attentions
and
was
rejoiced
when
the
admiralty
ordered
him
to
take
the
command
of
a
frigate
bound
to
the
mediterranean
the
last
fervent
kiss
which
he
imprinted
on
her
lips
as
she
breathed
out
the
cold
ross
take
care
of
yourself
seemed
to
her
the
seal
of
freedom
and
she
returned
into
her
not
to
weep
but
to
exult
in
the
prospect
of
a
thousand
festivities
and
a
thousand
captives
at
her
feet
left
at
an
early
age
without
a
mother
and
ignorant
of
the
duties
of
a
wife
she
thought
that
if
she
kept
her
husband
and
herself
out
of
doctor
commons
she
should
do
no
harm
by
amusing
herself
with
the
heart
of
every
man
who
came
in
her
way
thus
she
hardly
moved
without
a
train
of
admirers
she
had
already
attracted
everyone
she
deemed
worthy
of
the
trouble
and
listened
to
their
compliments
and
insolent
presumptions
until
she
was
wearied
of
both
in
this
juncture
of
miss
egerton
related
to
her
the
recontre
with
the
gallant
foreigner
as
soon
as
she
heard
he
was
of
rank
for
miss
egerton
was
not
backward
to
affirm
the
dreams
of
her
own
imagination
she
formed
a
wish
to
see
him
and
when
to
her
infinite
satisfaction
he
did
present
himself
in
her
eyes
he
exceeded
everything
that
had
been
described
to
secure
such
a
conquest
she
thought
would
not
only
raise
the
envy
of
the
women
but
put
the
men
on
the
alert
to
discover
some
novel
and
attractive
way
of
proving
their
devotion
whilst
lady
sara
was
meditating
on
her
new
conquest
the
count
and
lady
tinemouth
remained
in
their
her
ladyship
talked
to
him
on
various
subjects
but
he
answered
ill
upon
them
all
and
sometimes
very
wide
of
the
matter
at
last
conscious
that
he
must
be
burdensome
he
arose
and
looking
paler
and
more
depressed
than
when
he
entered
wished
her
a
good
morning
i
am
afraid
constantine
you
are
unwell
like
most
people
who
desire
to
hide
what
is
passing
in
their
minds
thaddeus
gladly
assented
to
this
as
an
excuse
for
a
taciturnity
he
could
not
overcome
then
cried
her
ladyship
i
hope
you
will
let
me
know
where
to
send
to
inquire
after
your
health
thaddeus
was
confounded
for
a
moment
then
returning
into
the
room
he
took
up
a
pen
which
lay
on
the
table
and
said
i
will
write
my
address
to
a
place
where
any
of
your
commands
may
reach
me
but
i
will
do
myself
the
honor
to
repeat
my
call
very
soon
i
shall
always
be
happy
to
see
you
replied
the
countess
while
he
was
writing
but
before
i
engage
you
in
a
promise
of
which
you
may
afterwards
repent
i
must
tell
you
that
you
will
meet
with
dull
entertainment
at
my
house
i
see
very
little
company
and
were
it
not
for
the
inexhaustible
spirits
of
miss
egerton
i
believe
i
should
become
a
complete
misanthrope
your
house
will
be
my
paradise
exclaimed
the
count
with
an
expressiveness
to
the
force
of
which
he
did
not
immediately
attend
lady
tinemouth
smiled
i
must
warn
you
here
too
cried
she
miss
egerton
must
not
be
the
deity
of
your
paradise
she
is
already
under
engagements
thaddeus
blushed
at
being
mistaken
and
wished
to
explain
himself
you
misunderstand
me
madam
i
am
not
insensible
to
beauty
but
upon
my
word
at
that
moment
i
had
nothing
else
in
my
thoughts
than
gratitude
for
your
ladyship
kindness
to
an
absolute
stranger
that
is
true
constantine
you
are
an
absolute
stranger
if
the
want
of
a
formal
introduction
and
an
ignorance
of
your
family
constitute
that
title
but
your
protection
introduced
you
to
me
and
there
is
something
in
your
appearance
which
convinces
me
that
i
need
not
be
afraid
of
admitting
you
into
the
very
scanty
number
of
my
friends
thaddeus
perceived
the
delicacy
of
lady
tinemouth
who
wished
to
know
who
he
was
and
yet
was
unwilling
to
give
him
pain
by
a
question
so
direct
that
he
must
answer
it
as
she
now
proposed
it
she
left
him
entirely
to
his
own
discretion
and
he
determined
to
satisfy
her
very
proper
curiosity
as
far
as
he
could
without
exposing
his
real
name
and
circumstances
the
countess
whose
benevolent
heart
was
deeply
interested
in
his
favor
observed
the
changes
of
his
countenance
with
an
anxious
hope
that
he
would
be
ingenuous
her
solicitude
did
not
arise
from
any
doubts
of
his
quality
and
worth
but
she
wished
to
be
enabled
to
reply
with
promptness
to
the
inquisitive
people
who
might
see
him
at
her
house
i
hardly
know
said
thaddeus
in
what
words
to
express
my
sense
of
your
ladyship
generous
confidence
in
me
and
that
my
character
is
not
undeserving
of
such
distinction
time
i
trust
will
prove
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
resumed
for
my
rank
lady
tinemouth
it
is
now
of
little
consequence
to
my
comfort
rather
perhaps
a
source
of
mortification
for
he
hesitated
and
then
proceeded
with
a
faint
color
tinging
his
cheek
exiles
from
their
country
if
they
would
not
covet
misery
must
learn
to
forget
hence
i
am
no
other
than
constantine
though
in
acknowledgment
of
your
ladyship
goodness
i
deem
it
only
just
that
i
should
not
conceal
my
real
quality
from
you
my
family
was
one
of
the
first
in
poland
even
in
banishment
the
remembrance
that
its
virtues
were
as
well
known
as
its
name
affords
some
alleviation
to
the
conviction
that
when
my
country
fell
all
my
property
and
all
my
kindred
were
involved
in
the
ruin
soon
after
the
dreadful
sealing
of
its
fate
i
quitted
it
and
by
the
command
of
a
dying
parent
who
expired
in
my
arms
sought
a
refuge
in
this
island
from
degradations
which
otherwise
i
could
neither
repel
nor
avoid
thaddeus
stopped
and
the
countess
struck
by
the
graceful
modesty
with
which
this
simple
account
was
related
laid
her
hand
upon
his
constantine
i
am
not
surprised
at
what
you
have
said
the
melancholy
of
your
air
induced
me
to
suspect
that
you
were
not
happy
and
my
sole
wish
in
penetrating
your
reserve
was
to
show
you
that
a
woman
can
be
a
sincere
friend
tears
of
gratitude
glistened
in
the
count
eyes
incapable
of
making
a
suitable
reply
he
pressed
her
hand
to
his
lips
she
rose
and
willing
to
relieve
a
sensibility
that
delighted
her
added
i
will
not
detain
you
longer
only
let
me
see
you
soon
thaddeus
uttered
a
few
inarticulate
words
whose
significancy
conveyed
nothing
but
all
he
felt
was
declared
in
their
confusion
the
countess
eloquent
smile
showed
that
she
comprehended
their
meaning
and
he
left
the
room
chapter
xx
woman
kindness
on
the
count
return
home
he
found
general
butzou
in
better
spirits
still
poring
over
his
journal
this
book
seemed
to
be
the
representative
of
all
which
had
ever
been
dear
to
him
he
dwelt
upon
it
and
talked
about
it
with
a
doating
eagerness
bordering
on
insanity
these
symptoms
increasing
from
day
to
day
gave
his
young
friend
considerable
uneasiness
he
listened
with
pain
to
the
fond
dreams
which
took
possession
of
the
poor
old
man
who
delighted
in
saying
that
much
might
yet
be
done
in
poland
when
he
should
be
recovered
and
they
be
enabled
to
return
together
to
warsaw
and
stimulate
the
people
to
resume
their
rights
thaddeus
at
first
attempted
to
prove
the
emptiness
of
these
schemes
but
seeing
that
contradiction
on
this
head
threw
the
general
into
deeper
despondency
he
thought
it
better
to
affect
the
same
sentiments
too
well
perceiving
that
death
would
soon
terminate
these
visions
with
the
venerable
dreamer
life
accordingly
as
far
as
lay
in
the
count
power
he
satisfied
all
the
fancied
wants
of
his
revered
friend
who
on
every
other
subject
was
perfectly
reasonable
but
at
last
he
became
so
absorbed
in
this
chimerical
plot
that
other
conversation
or
his
meals
seemed
to
oppress
him
with
restraint
when
thaddeus
perceived
that
his
company
was
rather
irksome
than
a
comfort
to
his
friend
he
the
more
readily
repeated
his
visits
to
lady
tinemouth
she
now
looked
for
his
appearance
at
least
once
a
day
if
ever
a
morning
and
an
evening
passed
away
without
his
appearance
he
was
sure
of
being
scolded
by
miss
egerton
reproached
by
the
countess
and
frowned
at
by
lady
sara
ross
in
defiance
of
all
other
engagements
this
lady
contrived
to
drop
in
every
night
at
lady
tinemouth
her
ladyship
was
not
more
surprised
at
this
sudden
attachment
of
lady
sara
to
her
house
than
pleased
with
her
society
she
found
she
could
lay
aside
in
her
little
circle
that
tissue
of
affectation
and
fashion
which
she
wore
in
public
and
really
became
a
charming
woman
though
lady
sara
was
vain
she
was
mistress
of
sufficient
sense
to
penetrate
with
tolerable
certainty
into
the
characters
of
her
acquaintance
most
of
the
young
men
with
whom
she
had
hitherto
associated
having
lived
from
youth
to
manhood
amongst
those
fashionable
assemblies
where
individuality
is
absorbed
in
the
general
mass
of
insipidity
she
saw
they
were
frivolous
though
obsequious
to
her
or
at
the
best
warped
in
taste
if
not
in
principle
and
the
fascinations
she
called
forth
to
subdue
them
were
suited
to
their
objects
her
beauty
her
thoughtless
or
her
caprice
but
on
the
reverse
when
she
formed
the
wish
to
entangle
such
a
man
as
thaddeus
she
soon
discovered
that
to
engage
his
attention
she
must
appear
in
the
unaffected
graces
of
nature
to
this
end
she
took
pains
to
display
the
loveliness
of
her
form
in
every
movement
and
position
yet
she
managed
the
action
with
so
inartificial
and
frank
an
air
that
she
seemed
the
only
person
present
who
was
unconscious
of
the
versatility
and
power
of
her
charms
she
conversed
with
good
sense
and
propriety
in
short
she
appeared
completely
different
from
the
gay
ridiculous
creature
he
had
seen
some
weeks
before
in
the
countess
he
now
admired
both
her
person
and
her
mind
her
winning
softness
the
vivacity
of
miss
egerton
and
the
kindness
of
the
countess
beguiled
him
many
an
evening
from
the
contemplation
of
melancholy
scenes
at
his
humble
and
anxious
home
one
night
it
came
into
the
head
of
sophia
egerton
to
banter
him
about
his
military
dress
do
for
heaven
sake
my
dear
don
quixote
cried
she
let
us
see
you
out
of
your
rusty
armor
i
declare
i
grow
frightened
at
it
and
i
can
not
but
think
you
would
be
merrier
out
of
that
customary
suit
of
solemn
black
this
demand
was
not
pleasing
to
thaddeus
but
he
replied
i
knew
not
till
you
were
so
kind
as
to
inform
me
that
a
man
temper
depends
on
his
clothes
else
i
suppose
cried
she
interrupting
him
you
would
have
changed
yours
before
therefore
i
expect
you
will
do
as
i
bid
you
now
and
put
on
a
christian
coat
against
you
next
enter
this
house
thaddeus
was
at
a
loss
what
to
say
he
only
bowed
and
the
countess
and
lady
sara
smiled
at
her
nonsense
when
they
parted
for
the
night
this
part
of
the
conversation
passed
off
from
all
minds
but
that
of
lady
tinemouth
she
had
considered
the
subject
but
in
a
different
way
from
her
gay
companion
sophia
supposed
that
the
handsome
constantine
wore
the
dress
of
his
country
because
it
was
the
most
becoming
but
as
such
a
whim
did
not
correspond
with
the
other
parts
of
his
character
lady
tinemouth
in
her
own
mind
attributed
this
adherence
to
his
national
habit
to
the
right
cause
she
remarked
that
whenever
she
wished
him
to
meet
any
agreeable
people
at
her
house
he
always
declined
these
introductions
under
the
plea
of
his
dress
though
he
never
proposed
to
alter
it
this
conduct
added
to
his
silence
on
every
subject
which
related
to
the
public
amusements
about
town
led
her
to
conclude
that
like
the
banished
nobility
of
france
he
was
encountering
the
various
inconveniences
of
poverty
in
a
foreign
land
she
hoped
that
he
had
escaped
its
horrors
but
she
could
not
be
certain
for
he
always
shifted
the
conversation
when
it
too
closely
referred
to
himself
these
observations
haunted
the
mind
of
lady
tinemouth
and
made
her
anxious
to
contrive
some
opportunity
in
which
she
might
have
this
interesting
constantine
alone
and
by
a
proper
management
of
the
discourse
lead
to
some
avowal
of
his
real
situation
hitherto
her
benevolent
intentions
had
been
frustrated
by
various
interruptions
at
various
times
indeed
had
she
been
actuated
by
mere
curiosity
she
would
long
ago
have
resigned
the
attempt
as
fruitless
but
pity
and
esteem
kept
her
watchful
until
the
very
hour
in
which
her
considerate
heart
was
fully
satisfied
one
morning
when
she
was
writing
in
her
cabinet
a
servant
informed
her
that
constantine
was
below
pleased
at
this
circumstance
she
took
advantage
of
a
slight
cold
that
affected
her
and
hoping
to
draw
something
out
of
him
in
the
course
of
a
begged
he
would
favor
her
by
coming
into
her
private
room
when
he
entered
she
perceived
that
he
looked
more
pensive
than
usual
he
sat
down
by
her
and
expressed
his
concern
at
her
indisposition
she
sighed
heavily
but
remained
silent
her
thoughts
were
too
much
occupied
with
her
kind
plan
to
immediately
form
a
reply
she
had
determined
to
give
him
a
cursory
idea
of
her
own
unhappiness
and
thus
by
her
confidence
attract
him
i
hope
miss
egerton
is
well
inquired
he
very
well
constantine
a
heart
at
ease
almost
ever
keeps
the
body
in
health
may
she
long
continue
as
happy
as
at
this
period
and
never
know
the
disappointments
of
her
friend
he
looked
at
the
countess
it
is
true
my
dear
sir
continued
she
it
is
hardly
probable
that
the
mere
effect
of
years
could
have
made
the
inroads
on
my
person
which
you
see
but
sorrow
has
done
it
and
with
all
the
comforts
you
behold
around
me
i
am
miserable
i
have
no
joy
independent
of
the
few
friends
which
heaven
has
preserved
to
me
and
yet
added
she
i
have
another
anxiety
united
with
those
of
which
i
complain
some
of
my
friends
who
afford
me
the
consolation
i
mention
deny
me
the
only
return
in
my
power
the
office
of
sharing
their
griefs
thaddeus
understood
the
expression
of
her
ladyship
eye
and
the
tenderness
of
her
voice
as
she
uttered
these
words
he
saw
to
whom
the
kind
reproach
was
directed
and
he
looked
down
confused
and
oppressed
the
countess
resumed
i
can
not
deny
what
your
countenance
declares
you
think
i
mean
you
i
do
constantine
i
have
marked
your
melancholy
i
have
weighed
other
circumstances
and
i
am
sure
that
you
have
many
things
to
struggle
with
besides
the
regrets
which
must
ever
hang
about
the
bosom
of
a
brave
man
who
has
witnessed
the
destruction
of
his
country
forgive
me
if
i
give
you
pain
added
she
observing
his
heightening
color
i
speak
from
real
esteem
i
speak
to
you
as
i
would
to
my
own
son
were
he
in
your
situation
my
dearest
madam
cried
thaddeus
overcome
by
her
benevolence
you
have
judged
rightly
i
have
many
things
to
struggle
with
i
have
a
sick
friend
at
home
whom
misfortune
hath
nearly
bereft
of
reason
and
whose
wants
are
now
so
complicated
and
expensive
that
never
till
now
did
i
know
the
complete
desolation
of
a
man
without
a
country
or
a
profession
for
myself
lady
tinemouth
adversity
has
few
pangs
but
for
my
friend
for
an
old
man
whose
deranged
faculties
have
forgotten
the
change
in
my
affairs
he
who
leans
on
me
for
support
and
comfort
it
is
this
that
must
account
to
your
ladyship
for
those
inconsistencies
in
my
manner
and
spirits
which
are
so
frequently
the
subject
of
miss
egerton
raillery
thaddeus
in
the
course
of
this
short
and
rapid
narrative
gradually
lowered
the
tone
of
his
voice
and
at
the
close
covered
his
face
with
his
hand
he
had
never
before
confided
the
history
of
his
embarrassments
to
any
creature
and
he
thought
notwithstanding
the
countess
solicitations
he
had
committed
an
outrage
on
the
firmness
of
his
character
by
having
in
anyway
acknowledged
the
weight
of
his
calamities
lady
tinemouth
considered
a
few
minutes
and
then
addressed
him
i
should
ill
repay
this
generous
confidence
my
noble
young
friend
were
i
to
hesitate
a
moment
in
forming
some
plan
which
may
prove
of
service
to
you
you
have
told
me
no
more
constantine
than
i
suspected
and
i
had
something
in
view
here
the
countess
stopped
expecting
that
her
auditor
would
interrupt
her
he
remained
silent
and
she
proceeded
you
spoke
of
a
profession
of
an
employment
yes
madam
returned
he
taking
his
hands
from
his
eyes
i
should
be
glad
to
engage
in
any
profession
or
employment
you
would
recommend
i
have
little
interest
answered
her
ladyship
with
people
in
power
therefore
i
can
not
propose
anything
which
will
in
any
degree
suit
with
your
rank
but
the
employment
that
i
have
in
view
several
of
the
most
illustrious
french
nobility
have
not
disdained
to
execute
do
not
fear
to
mention
it
to
me
cried
the
count
perceiving
her
reluctance
i
would
attempt
anything
that
is
not
dishonorable
to
render
service
to
my
poor
friend
well
then
would
you
have
any
objection
to
teach
languages
thaddeus
immediately
answered
oh
no
i
should
be
happy
to
do
so
then
replied
she
greatly
relieved
by
the
manner
in
which
he
received
her
proposal
i
will
now
tell
you
that
about
a
week
ago
i
paid
a
visit
to
lady
dundas
the
widow
of
sir
hector
dundas
the
rich
east
indian
director
whilst
i
was
there
i
heard
her
talking
with
her
two
daughters
about
finding
a
proper
master
to
teach
them
german
that
language
has
become
a
very
fashionable
accomplishment
amongst
literary
ladies
and
misa
dundas
being
a
member
of
the
club
footnote
such
was
the
real
name
given
at
the
time
to
montague
celebrated
literary
parties
held
at
her
house
in
portman
square
the
late
venerable
sir
william
pepys
was
one
of
their
last
survivors
had
declared
her
resolution
to
make
a
new
translation
of
werter
lady
dundas
expressed
many
objections
against
the
vulgarity
of
various
teachers
whom
the
young
ladies
proposed
and
ended
with
saying
that
unless
some
german
gentleman
could
be
found
they
must
remain
ignorant
of
the
language
your
image
instantly
shot
across
my
mind
and
deeming
it
a
favorable
opportunity
i
told
her
ladyship
that
if
she
could
wait
a
few
days
i
would
sound
a
friend
of
mine
who
i
knew
if
he
would
condescend
to
take
the
trouble
must
be
the
most
eligible
person
imaginable
lady
dundas
and
the
girls
gladly
left
the
affair
to
me
and
i
now
propose
it
to
you
and
i
replied
he
with
a
thousand
thanks
accept
the
task
then
i
will
make
the
usual
arrangements
returned
her
ladyship
and
send
you
the
result
after
half
an
hour
further
conversation
lady
tinemouth
became
more
impressed
with
the
unsophisticated
delicacy
and
dignity
of
the
count
mind
and
he
more
grateful
than
utterance
could
declare
left
his
respects
for
miss
egerton
and
took
his
leave

fashionable
sketches
from
the
life
next
morning
whilst
thaddeus
was
vainly
explaining
to
the
general
that
he
no
longer
possessed
a
regiment
of
horse
which
the
poor
old
man
wanted
him
to
order
out
to
try
the
success
of
some
manoeuvres
he
had
been
devising
little
nanny
brought
in
a
letter
from
where
he
had
noted
lady
tinemouth
to
direct
it
to
him
footnote
this
respectable
hotel
still
exists
near
the
top
of
martin
he
opened
it
and
found
these
contents
my
dear
sir
so
anxious
was
i
to
terminate
the
affair
with
lady
dundas
that
i
went
to
her
house
last
night
i
affirmed
it
as
a
great
obligation
that
you
would
undertake
the
trouble
to
teach
her
daughters
and
i
insist
that
you
do
not
from
any
romantic
ideas
of
candor
invalidate
what
i
have
said
i
know
the
world
too
well
not
to
be
convinced
of
the
truth
of
goldsmith
maxim
you
be
poor
do
not
seem
poor
if
you
would
avoid
insult
as
well
as
suffering
i
told
miss
dundas
that
you
had
undertaken
the
task
solely
at
my
persuasion
and
that
i
could
not
propose
other
terms
than
a
guinea
for
two
lessons
she
is
rich
enough
for
any
expense
and
made
no
objection
to
my
demand
besides
she
presented
the
enclosed
by
way
of
it
is
customary
thus
i
have
settled
all
preliminaries
and
you
are
to
commence
your
first
lesson
on
monday
at
two
but
before
then
pray
let
me
see
you
can
not
you
dine
with
us
on
sunday
a
sabbath
privilege
to
speak
of
good
is
blameless
i
have
informed
miss
egerton
of
as
much
of
the
affair
as
i
think
necessary
to
account
for
your
new
occupation
in
short
gay
in
spirits
as
she
is
i
thought
it
most
prudent
to
say
as
little
to
her
and
to
lady
sara
as
i
have
done
to
the
dundases
therefore
do
not
be
uneasy
on
that
head
come
if
not
before
and
you
will
give
real
pleasure
to
your
sincere
friend
adeliza
tinemouth
saturday
morning
grosvenor
place
truly
grateful
to
the
active
friendship
of
the
countess
and
looking
at
the
general
who
appeared
perfectly
happy
in
the
prosecution
of
his
wild
schemes
thaddeus
inwardly
exclaimed
by
these
means
i
shall
at
least
have
it
in
my
power
to
procure
the
assistance
which
your
melancholy
state
my
revered
friend
requires
on
opening
the
enclosed
which
her
ladyship
mentioned
he
found
it
to
be
a
bank
note
for
ten
pounds
both
the
present
and
its
amount
gave
him
pain
not
having
done
any
service
yet
to
the
donor
he
regarded
the
money
more
as
a
gift
than
as
a
bond
of
engagement
however
he
found
that
this
delicacy
with
many
other
painful
repugnances
must
at
this
moment
be
laid
aside
and
without
further
he
consigned
the
money
to
the
use
for
which
he
felt
aware
the
countess
had
wished
it
to
be
applied
namely
to
provide
himself
with
an
english
dress
during
these
various
reflections
he
did
not
leave
lady
letter
unanswered
he
thanked
her
sincerely
for
her
zeal
but
declined
dining
with
her
the
next
day
on
account
of
leaving
his
poor
friend
so
long
alone
though
he
promised
to
come
in
the
evening
when
he
should
be
retired
to
rest
this
excuse
was
regretted
by
none
more
than
lady
sara
ross
who
having
heard
from
lady
tinemouth
that
she
expected
constantine
to
dinner
on
a
sunday
invited
herself
to
be
one
of
the
party
she
had
now
seen
him
constantly
for
nearly
a
month
and
found
to
her
amazement
that
in
seeking
to
beguile
him
she
had
only
ensnared
herself
every
word
he
uttered
penetrated
to
her
heart
every
glance
of
his
eyes
shook
her
frame
like
electricity
she
had
now
no
necessity
to
affect
softness
a
young
and
unsuspected
passion
had
stolen
into
her
bosom
and
imparted
to
her
voice
and
countenance
all
its
subtle
power
to
enchant
and
to
subdue
thaddeus
was
not
insensible
to
this
gentle
fascination
for
it
appeared
to
his
ingenuous
nature
to
be
unconsciously
shown
and
from
under
veiled
lids
he
looked
on
her
as
indeed
a
lovely
woman
who
with
a
touching
delicacy
he
observed
often
tried
to
stifle
sigh
after
sigh
which
fluttering
rose
to
her
silent
lips
thus
as
silently
remarking
her
he
became
deeply
interested
in
her
for
he
believed
her
yearning
heart
then
thought
of
her
gallant
husband
far
far
at
sea
so
had
been
his
conclusion
when
he
first
noticed
these
demonstrations
of
an
inward
unuttered
sensibility
but
in
a
little
while
afterwards
when
those
veiled
lids
were
occasionally
raised
and
met
his
compassionate
gaze
she
mistook
the
nature
of
its
expression
and
her
responsive
glance
wild
with
ecstasy
returned
him
one
that
darted
astonishment
with
an
appalling
dread
of
his
meaning
through
his
every
vein
but
on
his
pillow
the
same
night
when
he
reflected
on
what
he
had
felt
on
receiving
so
strange
a
look
from
a
married
woman
and
one
too
whom
he
believed
to
be
a
virtuous
one
he
could
not
he
would
not
suppose
it
meant
anything
to
him
and
ashamed
of
even
the
idea
having
entered
his
head
he
crushed
it
at
once
indignant
at
himself
though
whenever
he
subsequently
met
her
at
lady
tinemouth
he
could
not
help
as
if
by
a
natural
impulse
avoiding
the
encountering
of
her
eyes
in
the
course
of
conversation
at
dinner
on
the
day
thaddeus
had
been
expected
by
lady
tinemouth
in
a
tone
of
pleasure
she
mentioned
that
she
had
conferred
a
great
favor
on
her
young
cousins
the
misses
dundas
by
having
prevailed
on
constantine
to
undertake
the
trouble
of
teaching
them
german
lady
sara
could
not
conceal
her
vexation
nor
her
wonder
at
lady
tinemouth
thinking
of
such
a
thing
and
she
uttered
something
like
angry
contempt
at
acquiescence
while
inwardly
she
hated
her
former
old
friend
for
having
made
the
proposal
miss
egerton
laughed
at
the
scrape
into
which
lady
tinemouth
had
brought
his
good
nature
and
declared
she
would
tell
him
next
time
she
saw
him
what
a
mulish
pair
of
misses
he
had
presumed
to
manage
it
was
the
youngest
of
these
misses
that
excited
lady
displeasure
euphemia
dundas
was
very
pretty
she
had
a
large
fortune
at
her
disposal
and
what
might
not
such
united
temptations
effect
on
the
mind
of
a
man
exposed
every
day
to
her
habitual
flirtation
stung
with
jealousy
lady
sara
caught
at
a
slight
intimation
of
his
possibly
coming
in
before
the
evening
should
close
rallying
her
smiles
she
resolved
to
make
one
more
essay
on
his
relapsed
insensibility
before
she
beheld
him
enter
scenes
so
likely
to
extinguish
her
hopes
hopes
of
what
she
never
allowed
herself
to
inquire
she
knew
that
she
never
had
loved
her
husband
that
now
she
detested
him
and
was
devoted
to
another
to
be
assured
of
a
reciprocal
passion
from
that
other
she
believed
was
the
extent
of
her
wish
thinking
that
she
held
her
husband
honor
safe
as
her
life
she
determined
to
do
what
she
pleased
with
her
heart
her
former
admirers
were
now
neglected
and
to
the
astonishment
and
admiration
of
the
graver
part
of
her
acquaintance
she
had
lately
relinquished
all
the
assemblies
in
which
she
had
so
recently
been
the
brightest
attraction
to
seclude
herself
by
the
domestic
fireside
of
the
countess
of
tinemouth
thus
whilst
the
world
were
admiring
a
conduct
they
supposed
would
give
a
lasting
happiness
to
herself
and
to
her
husband
she
was
cherishing
a
passion
which
might
prove
the
destruction
of
both
on
sunday
evening
thaddeus
entered
lady
tinemouth
just
as
miss
egerton
seated
herself
before
the
tea
equipage
at
sight
of
him
she
nodded
her
head
and
called
him
to
sit
by
her
lady
tinemouth
returned
the
grateful
pressure
of
his
hand
lady
sara
received
him
with
a
palpitating
heart
and
stooped
to
remove
something
that
seemed
to
incommode
her
foot
but
it
was
only
a
feint
to
hide
the
blushes
which
were
burning
on
her
cheek
no
one
observed
her
confusion
so
common
is
it
for
those
who
are
the
constant
witnesses
of
our
actions
to
be
the
most
ignorant
of
their
expression
and
tendency
thaddeus
could
not
in
spite
of
himself
be
so
uninformed
and
he
gladly
obeyed
a
second
summons
from
the
gay
sophia
and
drew
his
chair
close
to
hers
lady
sara
observed
his
motions
with
a
pang
she
could
not
conceal
and
pulling
her
seat
as
far
from
the
opposite
side
as
possible
began
in
silence
to
sip
her
tea
ye
powers
of
gallantry
suddenly
exclaimed
miss
egerton
pushing
away
the
table
and
lifting
her
to
her
eye
i
declare
i
have
conquered
look
lady
tinemouth
look
lady
sara
if
constantine
does
not
better
become
this
english
dress
than
his
polish
horribles
did
him
drown
me
for
a
witch
you
see
i
have
obeyed
you
madam
returned
thaddeus
smiling
ah
you
are
in
the
right
most
men
do
that
cheerfully
when
they
know
they
gain
by
the
bargain
now
you
look
like
a
christian
man
before
you
always
reminded
me
of
some
stalking
hero
in
a
tragedy
yes
cried
lady
sara
forcing
a
smile
and
now
you
have
given
him
a
striking
resemblance
to
george
barnwell
sophia
who
did
not
perceive
the
sarcasm
couched
under
this
remark
replied
may
be
so
lady
sara
but
i
do
care
for
his
black
suit
obedience
was
the
thing
i
wanted
and
i
have
it
in
the
present
appearance
pray
lady
tinemouth
asked
her
ladyship
seeking
to
revenge
herself
on
his
alacrity
to
obey
miss
egerton
what
is
it
i
have
promised
to
be
at
lady
sarum
concert
by
ten
it
is
not
nine
returned
the
countess
besides
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
heard
of
your
engagement
i
hoped
you
would
have
spent
all
the
evening
with
us
no
answered
lady
sara
i
can
not
and
ringing
the
bell
she
rose
bless
me
lady
sara
cried
miss
egerton
you
are
not
going
you
hear
that
it
is
little
more
than
eight
busying
herself
in
tying
her
cloak
lady
sara
affected
not
to
hear
her
and
told
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
to
order
her
carriage
surprised
at
this
precipitation
but
far
from
guessing
the
cause
lady
tinemouth
requested
constantine
to
see
her
ladyship
down
stairs
i
would
rather
not
cried
she
in
a
quick
voice
and
darting
out
of
the
room
was
followed
by
thaddeus
who
came
up
with
her
just
as
she
reached
the
street
door
he
hastened
to
assist
her
into
the
carriage
and
saw
by
the
light
of
the
flambeaux
her
face
streaming
with
tears
he
had
already
extended
his
hand
when
instead
of
accepting
it
she
pushed
it
from
her
and
jumped
into
the
carriage
crying
in
an
indignant
tone
to
berkeley
square
he
remained
for
a
few
minutes
looking
after
her
then
returned
into
the
house
too
well
able
to
translate
the
meaning
of
all
this
petulance
when
he
reascended
the
stairs
lady
tinemouth
expressed
her
wonder
at
the
whimsical
departure
of
her
friend
but
as
thaddeus
who
was
really
disturbed
returned
a
vague
reply
the
subject
ended
miss
egerton
who
hardly
thought
two
minutes
on
the
same
thing
sent
away
the
and
sitting
down
by
him
exclaimed
constantine
i
hold
it
right
that
no
man
should
be
thrown
into
a
den
of
wild
creatures
without
knowing
what
sort
of
animals
he
must
meet
there
hence
as
i
find
you
have
undertaken
the
taming
of
that
lady
dundas
and
her
pretty
cubs
i
must
give
you
a
taste
of
their
quality
will
you
hear
me
certainly
will
you
attend
to
my
advice
if
i
like
it
ha
replied
she
returning
his
smile
with
another
that
is
just
such
an
answer
as
i
would
have
made
myself
so
i
wo
quarrel
with
you
lady
tinemouth
you
will
allow
me
to
draw
your
pictures
yes
sophia
provided
you
do
make
them
caricatures
remember
your
candor
is
at
stake
constantine
will
judge
for
himself
and
i
am
sure
he
will
agree
with
me
now
lady
dundas
if
you
please
i
know
your
ladyship
is
a
great
stickler
for
precedence
lady
tinemouth
laughed
and
interrupted
her
i
declare
sophia
you
are
a
very
daring
girl
what
do
you
not
risk
by
giving
way
to
this
satirical
spirit
not
anybody
love
that
i
value
lady
tinemouth
know
that
i
never
daub
a
fair
character
constantine
takes
me
on
your
credit
and
if
you
mean
charles
montresor
he
is
as
bad
as
myself
and
dare
not
for
his
life
have
any
qualms
well
well
proceed
cried
her
ladyship
i
will
not
interrupt
you
again
then
resumed
she
i
must
begin
with
lady
dundas
in
proper
historical
style
i
shall
commence
with
her
birth
parentage
and
education
for
the
first
my
father
remembers
her
when
she
was
to
judge
sefton
lady
at
surat
and
soon
after
her
arrival
there
this
pretty
abigail
by
some
means
captivated
old
hector
dundas
then
governor
of
the
province
who
married
her
when
she
returned
in
triumph
to
england
she
coaxed
her
foolish
husband
to
appropriate
some
of
his
rupee
riches
to
the
purchase
of
a
baronetage
i
suppose
the
appellation
put
her
in
mind
of
her
abigailship
and
in
a
fond
hour
he
complied
and
she
became
that
over
sir
hector
had
nothing
more
obliging
to
do
in
this
world
but
to
clear
her
way
to
perhaps
a
coronet
he
was
so
good
as
to
think
so
himself
and
to
add
to
former
obligations
had
the
civility
to
walk
out
of
it
for
one
night
whether
he
had
been
dreaming
of
his
feats
in
india
or
of
a
review
of
his
grand
entry
into
his
governorship
palace
i
can
not
affirm
but
he
marched
out
of
his
bed
room
window
and
broke
his
neck
ever
since
that
untoward
event
lady
dundas
has
exhibited
the
finest
parties
in
town
everybody
goes
to
see
her
but
whether
in
compliment
to
their
own
taste
or
to
her
silver
muslins
i
do
know
for
there
are
half
a
dozen
titled
ladies
of
her
acquaintance
who
to
my
certain
knowledge
have
not
bought
a
this
twelvemonth
well
how
do
you
like
lady
dundas
i
do
not
like
your
sketch
replied
thaddeus
with
an
unconscious
sigh
come
do
sigh
about
my
veracity
interrupted
miss
egerton
i
do
assure
you
i
should
have
been
more
correct
had
i
been
more
severe
for
her
indian
ladyship
is
as
as
she
is
and
is
as
presumptuous
as
ignorant
in
short
she
is
a
fit
mamma
for
the
delectable
miss
dundas
whose
description
you
shall
have
in
two
questions
can
you
imagine
socrates
in
his
wife
petticoats
can
you
imagine
a
pedant
a
scold
and
a
coquette
in
one
woman
if
you
can
you
have
a
foretaste
of
diana
dundas
she
is
large
and
ugly
and
thinks
herself
delicate
and
handsome
she
is
and
arrogant
and
believes
herself
wise
and
learned
and
to
sum
up
all
she
is
the
most
malicious
creature
breathing
my
dear
sophia
cried
lady
tinemouth
alarmed
at
the
effect
such
high
coloring
might
have
on
the
mind
of
thaddeus
for
heaven
sake
be
temperate
i
never
heard
you
so
unbecomingly
harsh
in
my
life
miss
egerton
peeped
archly
in
her
face
are
you
serious
lady
tinemouth
you
know
that
i
would
not
look
unbecoming
in
your
eyes
besides
she
is
no
real
relation
of
yours
come
shake
hands
with
me
and
i
will
be
more
merciful
to
the
gentle
euphemia
for
i
intend
that
constantine
shall
be
her
favorite
wo
you
cried
she
resigning
her
ladyship
hand
thaddeus
shook
his
head
i
do
understand
your
lord
burleigh
nods
answer
me
in
words
when
i
have
finished
for
i
am
sure
you
will
delight
in
the
zephyr
smiles
of
so
sweet
a
fairy
she
is
so
tiny
and
so
pretty
that
i
never
see
her
without
thinking
of
some
gay
little
trinket
all
over
precious
stones
her
eyes
are
two
diamond
sparks
melted
into
lustre
and
her
teeth
seed
pearl
lying
between
rubies
so
much
for
the
casket
but
for
the
quality
of
the
jewel
within
i
leave
you
to
make
the
discovery
miss
egerton
having
run
herself
out
of
breath
suddenly
stopped
seeing
that
he
was
called
upon
to
say
something
thaddeus
made
an
answer
which
only
drew
upon
him
a
new
volley
of
raillery
lady
tinemouth
tried
to
avert
it
but
she
failed
and
sophia
continued
talking
with
little
interruption
until
the
party
separated
for
the
night
chapter
xxii
honorable
resources
of
an
exile
now
that
the
count
thought
himself
secure
of
the
means
of
payment
he
sent
for
a
physician
to
consult
him
respecting
the
state
of
the
general
when
cavendish
saw
and
conversed
with
the
venerable
butzou
he
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
his
malady
was
chiefly
on
the
nerves
and
had
originated
in
grief
i
can
too
well
suppose
it
replied
thaddeus
then
rejoined
the
physician
i
fear
sir
that
unless
i
know
something
of
its
cause
my
visits
will
prove
almost
useless
the
count
was
silent
the
doctor
resumed
i
shall
be
grieved
if
his
sorrows
be
of
too
delicate
a
nature
to
be
trusted
with
a
man
of
honor
for
in
these
cases
unless
we
have
some
knowledge
of
the
springs
of
the
derangement
we
lose
time
and
perhaps
entirely
fail
of
a
cure
our
discipline
is
addressed
both
to
the
body
and
the
mind
of
the
patient
thaddeus
perceived
the
necessity
of
compliance
and
did
so
without
further
hesitation
the
calamities
sir
which
have
occasioned
the
disorder
of
my
friend
need
not
be
a
secret
too
many
have
shared
them
with
him
his
sorrows
have
been
public
ones
you
must
have
learnt
by
his
language
cavendish
that
he
is
a
foreigner
and
a
soldier
he
held
the
rank
of
general
in
the
king
of
poland
service
since
the
period
in
which
his
country
fell
his
wandering
senses
have
approximated
to
what
you
see
cavendish
paused
for
a
moment
before
he
answered
the
count
then
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
veteran
who
was
sitting
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
constructing
the
model
of
a
fortified
town
he
said
all
that
we
can
do
at
present
sir
is
to
permit
him
to
follow
his
schemes
without
contradiction
meanwhile
strengthening
his
system
with
proper
medicines
and
lulling
its
irritation
by
gentle
opiates
we
must
proceed
cautiously
and
i
trust
in
heaven
that
success
will
crown
us
at
last
i
will
order
something
to
be
taken
every
night
when
the
doctor
had
written
his
prescription
and
was
preparing
to
go
thaddeus
offered
him
his
fee
but
the
good
cavendish
taking
the
hand
that
presented
it
and
closing
it
on
the
guinea
no
my
dear
sir
said
he
real
patriotism
is
too
much
the
idol
of
my
heart
to
allow
me
to
receive
payment
when
i
behold
her
face
suffer
me
constantine
to
visit
you
and
your
brave
companion
as
a
friend
or
i
never
come
again
sir
this
generous
conduct
to
strangers
generous
to
myself
constantine
and
not
to
strangers
i
can
not
consider
you
as
such
for
men
who
devote
themselves
to
their
country
must
find
a
brother
in
every
honest
breast
i
will
not
hear
of
our
meeting
on
any
other
terms
footnote
this
generous
man
is
no
fictitious
character
the
original
being
blackburne
late
of
cavendish
square
but
who
since
the
above
was
written
has
long
retired
from
his
profession
passing
a
revered
old
age
in
the
beautiful
neighborhood
of
our
old
british
classic
scenes
the
abbey
of
glastonbury
thaddeus
could
not
immediately
form
a
reply
adequate
to
the
sentiment
which
the
generous
philanthropy
of
the
doctor
awakened
whilst
he
stood
incapable
of
speaking
cavendish
with
one
glance
of
his
penetrating
eye
deciphered
his
countenance
and
giving
him
a
friendly
shake
by
the
hand
disappeared
the
count
took
up
his
hat
and
musing
all
the
way
he
went
on
the
unexpected
scenes
we
meet
in
life
disappointment
where
we
expected
kindness
and
friendship
where
no
hope
could
arise
he
arrived
at
the
door
of
lady
dundas
in
harley
street
he
was
instantly
let
in
and
with
much
ceremony
ushered
into
a
splendid
library
where
he
was
told
the
ladies
would
attend
him
before
they
entered
they
allowed
him
time
to
examine
its
costly
furniture
its
glittering
globes
and
all
shining
with
burnished
gilding
its
polished
plaster
casts
of
the
nine
muses
which
stood
in
nine
recesses
about
the
room
draperied
with
blue
net
looped
up
with
artificial
roses
and
its
fine
grecian
stove
on
each
side
of
which
was
placed
on
pedestals
two
statues
of
apollo
and
minerva
thaddeus
had
twice
walked
round
these
fopperies
of
learning
when
the
door
opened
and
lady
dundas
dressed
in
a
morning
wrapper
of
indian
shawls
waddled
into
the
apartment
she
neither
bowed
nor
curtseyed
to
the
count
who
was
standing
when
she
entered
but
looking
at
him
from
head
to
foot
said
as
she
passed
so
you
are
come
and
ringing
the
bell
called
to
the
servant
in
no
very
soft
tones
tell
miss
dundas
the
person
lady
tinemouth
spoke
of
is
here
her
ladyship
then
sat
down
in
one
of
the
little
gilded
chairs
leaving
thaddeus
still
standing
on
the
spot
where
he
had
bowed
to
her
entrance
you
may
sit
down
cried
she
stirring
the
fire
and
not
deigning
to
look
at
him
for
my
daughter
may
not
choose
to
come
this
i
prefer
standing
replied
the
count
who
could
have
laughed
at
the
accuracy
of
miss
egerton
picture
had
he
not
prognosticated
more
disagreeableness
to
himself
from
the
ill
manners
of
which
this
was
a
specimen
lady
dundas
took
no
further
notice
of
him
turning
from
her
bloated
countenance
which
pride
as
well
as
high
living
had
swollen
from
prettiness
to
deformity
he
walked
to
a
window
and
stationed
himself
there
looking
into
the
street
until
the
door
was
again
opened
and
two
ladies
made
their
appearance
miss
dundas
cried
her
ladyship
here
is
the
young
man
that
is
to
teach
you
german
thaddeus
bowed
the
younger
of
the
ladies
curtseyed
and
so
did
the
other
not
forgetting
to
accompany
such
condescension
with
a
toss
of
the
head
that
the
effect
of
undue
humility
might
be
done
away
whilst
a
servant
was
setting
chairs
round
a
table
on
which
was
painted
the
judgment
of
hercules
lady
dundas
again
opened
her
lips
pray
thingumbob
have
you
brought
any
grammars
and
primers
and
dictionaries
and
syntaxes
with
you
before
he
had
time
to
reply
in
the
negative
miss
dundas
interrupted
her
mother
i
wish
madam
you
would
leave
the
arrangement
of
my
studies
to
myself
does
your
ladyship
think
we
would
learn
out
of
any
book
which
had
been
touched
by
other
people
thomas
cried
she
to
a
servant
send
stephens
hither
thaddeus
silently
contemplated
this
strange
mother
and
daughter
whilst
the
pretty
euphemia
paid
the
same
compliment
to
him
during
his
stay
he
ventured
to
look
once
only
at
her
figure
there
was
an
unreceding
something
in
her
liquid
blue
eyes
when
he
chanced
to
meet
them
which
displeased
him
and
he
could
not
help
seeing
that
from
the
instant
she
entered
the
room
she
had
seldom
ceased
staring
in
his
face
he
was
a
little
relieved
by
the
maid
putting
the
books
on
the
table
miss
dundas
taking
her
seat
desired
him
to
sit
down
by
her
and
arrange
the
lessons
lady
dundas
was
drawing
to
the
other
side
of
thaddeus
when
euphemia
suddenly
whisking
round
pushed
before
her
mother
and
exclaimed
dear
mamma
you
do
want
to
learn
and
squeezed
herself
upon
the
edge
of
her
mother
chair
who
very
angrily
getting
up
declared
that
rudeness
to
a
parent
was
intolerable
from
such
young
women
and
left
the
room
euphemia
blushed
at
the
reproof
more
than
at
her
conduct
and
miss
dundas
added
to
her
confusion
by
giving
her
a
second
reprimand
thaddeus
pitied
the
evident
embarrassment
of
the
little
beauty
and
to
relieve
her
presented
the
page
in
the
german
grammar
with
which
they
were
to
begin
this
had
the
desired
effect
and
for
an
hour
and
a
half
they
prosecuted
their
studies
with
close
attention
whilst
the
count
continued
his
directions
to
her
sister
and
then
turned
his
address
to
herself
miss
euphemia
wholly
unseen
by
him
with
a
bent
head
was
affecting
to
hear
him
though
at
the
same
time
she
looked
obliquely
through
her
thick
flaxen
ringlets
and
gazing
with
wonder
and
admiration
on
his
face
as
it
inclined
towards
her
said
to
herself
if
this
man
were
a
gentleman
i
should
think
him
the
most
charming
creature
in
the
world
will
your
task
be
too
long
madam
inquired
thaddeus
will
it
give
you
any
inconvenience
to
remember
to
remember
what
asked
she
for
in
truth
she
had
neither
seen
what
he
had
been
pointing
at
nor
heard
what
he
had
been
saying
the
lesson
madam
i
have
just
been
proposing
show
it
to
me
again
and
then
i
shall
be
a
better
judge
he
did
as
he
was
desired
and
was
taking
his
leave
when
she
called
after
him
pray
constantine
come
at
two
i
want
you
particularly
the
count
bowed
and
withdrew
and
what
do
you
want
with
him
child
asked
miss
dundas
you
are
not
accustomed
to
be
so
fond
of
improvement
euphemia
knew
very
well
what
she
was
accustomed
to
be
fond
of
but
not
choosing
to
let
her
austere
sister
into
her
predilection
for
the
contemplation
of
superior
beauty
she
merely
answered
you
know
diana
you
often
reproach
me
for
my
absurd
devotion
to
and
my
repugnance
to
graver
books
now
i
want
at
once
to
be
like
you
a
woman
of
great
erudition
and
for
that
purpose
i
will
study
day
and
night
at
the
german
till
i
can
read
all
the
philosophers
and
be
a
fit
companion
for
my
sister
this
speech
from
euphemia
who
had
always
been
so
declared
an
enemy
to
pedantry
as
to
affirm
that
she
learnt
german
merely
because
it
was
the
fashion
would
have
awakened
miss
dundas
to
some
suspicion
of
a
covert
design
had
she
not
been
in
the
habit
of
taking
down
such
large
draughts
of
adulation
that
whenever
herself
was
the
subject
she
gave
it
full
confidence
euphemia
seldom
administered
these
doses
but
to
serve
particular
views
and
seeing
in
the
present
case
that
a
little
flattery
was
necessary
she
felt
no
compunction
in
sacrificing
sincerity
to
the
gratification
of
caprice
weak
in
understanding
she
had
fed
on
works
of
imagination
until
her
mind
loathed
all
kinds
of
food
not
content
with
devouring
the
elegant
pages
of
mackenzie
radcliffe
and
lee
she
flew
with
voracious
appetite
to
sate
herself
on
the
garbage
of
any
circulating
library
that
fell
in
her
way
the
effects
of
such
a
taste
were
exhibited
in
her
manners
being
very
pretty
she
became
very
sentimental
she
dressed
like
a
wood
nymph
and
talked
as
if
her
soul
were
made
of
love
and
sorrow
neither
of
these
emotions
had
she
ever
really
felt
but
in
idea
she
was
always
the
victim
of
some
passion
fancying
herself
at
different
periods
in
love
with
one
or
other
of
the
finest
young
men
in
her
circle
by
this
management
she
kept
faithful
to
her
favorite
principle
that
love
was
a
want
of
her
soul
as
it
was
the
rule
of
her
life
it
ever
trembled
on
her
tongue
ever
introduced
the
confession
of
any
new
attachment
which
usually
happened
three
times
a
year
to
her
dear
friend
miss
arabella
rothes
fortunately
for
the
longevity
of
their
mutual
friendship
this
young
lady
lived
in
an
ancient
house
forty
miles
to
the
north
of
london
this
latter
circumstance
proved
a
pretty
distress
for
their
pens
to
descant
on
and
arabella
remained
a
most
charming
sentimental
to
receive
the
catalogue
of
miss
euphemia
lovers
indeed
that
gentle
creature
might
have
matched
every
lady
in
cowley
calendar
with
a
gentleman
but
every
throb
of
her
heart
must
have
acknowledged
a
different
master
first
the
fashionable
sloven
augustus
somers
lounged
and
sauntered
himself
into
her
good
graces
but
his
dishevelled
hair
and
otherwise
neglected
toilette
not
exactly
meeting
her
ideas
of
an
elegant
lover
she
gave
him
up
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
the
next
object
her
eyes
fell
upon
as
most
opposite
to
her
former
fancy
was
the
charming
marquis
of
inverary
but
here
all
her
arrows
failed
for
she
never
could
extract
from
him
more
than
a
how
d
do
through
the
long
lapse
of
four
months
during
which
time
she
continued
as
constant
to
his
fine
figure
and
her
own
folly
as
could
have
fallen
to
the
lot
of
any
poor
despairing
damsel
however
my
lord
was
so
cruel
so
perfidious
as
to
allow
several
opportunities
to
pass
in
which
he
might
have
declared
his
passion
and
she
told
arabella
in
a
letter
of
six
sheets
that
she
would
bear
it
no
longer
she
put
this
wise
resolution
in
practice
and
had
already
played
the
same
game
with
half
a
score
the
last
of
whom
was
a
young
guardsman
who
had
just
ridden
into
her
heart
by
managing
his
steed
with
the
air
of
a
feathered
mercury
one
day
in
hyde
park
when
thaddeus
made
his
appearance
before
her
the
moment
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
her
inflammable
imagination
was
set
in
a
blaze
she
forgot
his
apparent
subordinate
quality
in
the
nobleness
of
his
figure
and
once
or
twice
that
evening
while
she
was
flitting
about
the
sparkling
cynosure
of
the
duchess
of
masquerade
her
thoughts
hovered
over
the
handsome
foreigner
she
viewed
the
subject
first
one
way
and
then
another
and
in
her
ever
varying
mind
he
was
everything
by
turns
and
nothing
long
but
at
length
she
argued
herself
into
a
belief
that
he
must
be
a
man
of
rank
from
some
of
the
german
courts
who
having
seen
her
somewhere
unknown
to
herself
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
and
so
had
persuaded
lady
tinemouth
to
introduce
him
as
a
master
of
languages
to
her
family
that
he
might
the
better
appreciate
the
disinterestedness
of
her
disposition
this
wild
notion
having
once
got
into
her
head
received
instant
credence
she
resolved
without
seeming
to
suspect
it
to
treat
him
as
his
quality
deserved
and
to
deliver
sentiments
in
his
hearing
which
should
charm
him
with
their
delicacy
and
generosity
with
these
chimeras
floating
in
her
brain
she
returned
home
went
to
bed
and
dreamed
that
constantine
had
turned
out
to
be
the
had
offered
her
his
hand
and
that
she
was
conducted
to
the
altar
by
a
train
of
princes
and
princesses
his
brothers
and
sisters
she
woke
the
next
morning
from
these
deliriums
in
an
ecstasy
deeming
them
prophetic
and
taking
up
her
book
began
with
a
fluttering
attention
to
scan
the
lesson
which
thaddeus
had
desired
her
to
learn
chapter
xxiii
what
are
these
words
these
seeming
flowers
maids
to
call
them
in
idleness
the
following
day
at
noon
as
the
count
sobieski
was
crossing
cavendish
square
to
keep
his
appointment
in
harley
street
he
was
met
by
lady
sara
ross
she
had
spoken
with
the
misses
dundas
the
night
before
at
the
masquerade
where
discovering
the
pretty
euphemia
through
the
dress
of
eloisa
her
jealous
and
incensed
heart
could
not
withstand
the
temptation
of
hinting
at
the
captivating
abelard
she
had
selected
to
direct
her
studies
her
ladyship
soon
penetrated
into
the
situation
of
euphemia
heated
fancy
and
drew
from
her
without
betraying
herself
that
she
expected
to
see
her
master
the
following
day
stung
to
the
soul
lady
sara
quitted
the
rooms
and
in
a
paroxysm
of
disappointment
determined
to
throw
herself
in
his
way
as
he
went
to
her
rival
house
with
this
hope
she
had
already
been
traversing
the
square
upwards
of
half
an
hour
attended
by
her
maid
when
her
anxious
eye
at
last
caught
a
view
of
his
figure
proceeding
along
margaret
street
hardly
able
to
support
her
tottering
frame
shaken
as
it
was
with
contending
emotions
she
accosted
him
first
for
he
was
passing
straight
onward
without
looking
to
the
right
or
the
left
on
seeing
her
ladyship
he
stopped
and
expressed
his
pleasure
at
the
meeting
if
you
are
pleased
to
meet
me
said
she
forcing
a
smile
take
a
walk
with
me
round
the
square
i
want
to
speak
with
you
thaddeus
bowed
and
she
put
her
arm
through
his
but
remained
silent
for
a
few
minutes
in
evident
confusion
the
count
recollected
it
must
now
be
quite
two
he
knew
the
awkwardness
of
making
the
misses
dundas
wait
and
notwithstanding
his
reluctance
to
appear
impatient
with
lady
sara
he
found
himself
obliged
to
say
i
am
sorry
i
must
urge
your
ladyship
to
honor
me
with
your
commands
for
it
is
already
past
the
time
when
i
ought
to
have
been
with
the
misses
dundas
yes
cried
lady
sara
angrily
miss
euphemia
told
me
as
much
but
constantine
as
a
friend
i
must
warn
you
against
her
acts
as
well
as
against
those
of
another
lady
who
would
do
well
to
correct
the
boldness
of
her
manner
whom
do
you
mean
madam
interrogated
thaddeus
surprised
at
her
warmth
and
totally
at
a
loss
to
conjecture
to
whom
she
alluded
a
little
reflection
would
answer
you
returned
she
wishing
to
retreat
from
an
explanation
yet
stimulated
by
her
double
jealousy
to
proceed
she
may
be
a
good
girl
constantine
and
i
dare
say
she
is
but
a
woman
who
has
promised
her
hand
to
another
ought
not
to
flirt
with
you
what
business
had
miss
egerton
to
command
you
to
wear
an
english
dress
but
she
must
now
see
the
danger
of
her
conduct
by
your
having
presumed
to
obey
her
lady
sara
exclaimed
the
count
much
hurt
at
this
speech
i
hardly
understand
you
yet
i
believe
i
may
venture
to
affirm
that
in
all
which
you
have
just
now
said
you
are
mistaken
who
can
witness
the
general
frankness
of
miss
egerton
or
listen
to
the
candid
manner
with
which
she
avows
her
attachment
to
montresor
and
conceive
that
she
possesses
any
thoughts
which
would
not
do
her
honor
to
reveal
and
for
myself
added
he
lowering
the
tone
of
his
voice
i
trust
the
least
of
my
faults
is
presumption
it
never
was
my
character
to
presume
on
any
lady
condescension
and
if
dressing
as
she
approved
be
deemed
an
instance
of
that
kind
i
can
declare
upon
my
word
had
i
not
found
other
motives
besides
her
raillery
my
appearance
should
not
have
suffered
a
change
are
you
sincere
mr
constantine
cried
lady
sara
now
smiling
with
pleasure
indeed
i
am
and
happy
if
my
explanation
have
met
with
your
ladyship
approbation
constantine
resumed
she
i
have
no
motive
but
one
in
my
discourse
with
you
friendship
and
casting
her
eyes
down
she
sighed
profoundly
your
ladyship
does
me
honor
i
would
have
you
to
regard
me
with
the
same
confidence
that
you
do
lady
tinemouth
my
father
possesses
the
first
patronage
in
this
country
i
therefore
have
it
a
thousand
times
more
in
my
power
than
she
has
to
render
you
a
service
here
her
ladyship
overshot
herself
she
had
not
calculated
well
on
the
nature
of
the
mind
she
wished
to
ensnare
i
am
grateful
to
your
generosity
replied
thaddeus
but
on
this
head
i
must
decline
your
kind
offices
whilst
i
consider
myself
the
subject
of
one
king
though
he
be
in
a
prison
i
can
not
accept
of
any
employment
under
another
who
is
in
alliance
with
his
enemies
lady
sara
discovered
her
error
the
moment
he
had
made
his
answer
and
in
a
disappointed
tone
exclaimed
then
you
despise
my
friendship
no
lady
sara
it
is
an
honor
far
beyond
my
merits
and
any
gratitude
to
lady
tinemouth
must
be
doubled
when
i
recollect
that
i
possess
such
honor
through
her
means
well
cried
her
ladyship
have
that
as
you
will
but
i
expect
as
a
specimen
of
your
confidence
in
me
you
will
be
wary
of
euphemia
dundas
i
know
she
is
artful
and
vain
she
finds
amusement
in
attracting
the
affections
of
men
and
then
notwithstanding
her
affected
sensibility
she
turns
them
into
a
subject
for
laughter
i
thank
your
ladyship
replied
the
count
but
in
this
respect
i
think
i
am
safe
both
from
the
lady
and
myself
how
asked
lady
sara
rather
too
eagerly
is
your
heart
she
paused
and
looked
down
no
madam
replied
he
sighing
as
deeply
as
herself
but
with
his
thoughts
far
from
her
and
the
object
of
their
discourse
i
have
no
place
in
my
heart
to
give
to
love
besides
the
quality
in
which
i
appear
at
lady
dundas
would
preclude
the
vainest
man
alive
from
supposing
that
such
notice
from
any
lady
there
to
him
could
be
possible
therefore
i
am
safe
though
i
acknowledge
my
obligation
to
your
ladyship
caution
lady
sara
was
satisfied
with
the
first
part
of
this
answer
it
declared
that
his
heart
was
unoccupied
and
as
he
had
accepted
her
proffered
friendship
she
doubted
not
when
assisted
by
more
frequent
displays
of
her
fascinations
she
could
destroy
its
lambent
nature
and
in
the
end
light
up
in
his
bosom
a
similar
fire
to
that
which
consumed
her
own
the
unconscious
object
of
all
these
devices
began
internally
to
accuse
his
vanity
of
having
been
too
fanciful
in
the
formation
of
suspicions
which
on
a
former
occasion
he
had
believed
himself
forced
to
admit
blushing
at
a
quickness
of
perception
his
contrition
now
denominated
folly
he
found
himself
at
the
bottom
of
harley
street
lady
sara
called
her
servant
to
walk
nearer
to
her
and
telling
thaddeus
she
should
expect
him
the
next
evening
at
lady
tinemouth
wished
him
he
was
certain
that
he
must
have
stayed
at
least
half
an
hour
beyond
the
time
when
he
ought
to
be
with
the
sisters
anticipating
very
haughty
looks
and
perhaps
a
reprimand
he
knocked
at
the
door
and
was
again
shown
into
the
library
miss
euphemia
was
alone
he
offered
some
indistinct
excuse
for
having
made
her
wait
but
euphemia
with
alacrity
interrupted
him
o
pray
do
mind
you
have
made
nobody
wait
but
me
and
i
can
easily
forgive
it
for
mamma
and
my
sister
chose
to
go
out
at
one
it
being
to
see
the
dine
at
mrs
montague
footnote
this
was
a
gay
spectacle
and
a
most
kind
act
to
these
poor
children
who
thus
once
found
themselves
refreshed
and
happy
they
resorted
to
the
green
of
montague
house
every
about
one
dressed
in
their
gala
wreaths
and
sporting
with
their
brushes
and
shovels
where
they
found
a
good
dinner
kind
words
from
their
hostess
and
her
guests
and
each
little
sweep
received
a
shilling
at
parting
on
the
death
of
montague
this
humane
and
pleasurable
spectacle
ceased
they
did
as
they
liked
and
i
preferred
staying
at
home
to
repeat
my
lesson
thaddeus
thanking
her
for
her
indulgence
sat
down
and
taking
the
book
began
to
question
her
not
one
word
could
she
recollect
she
smiled
i
am
afraid
madam
you
have
never
thought
of
it
since
yesterday
morning
indeed
i
have
thought
of
nothing
else
you
must
forgive
me
i
am
very
stupid
constantine
at
learning
languages
and
german
is
so
harsh
at
least
to
my
ears
can
not
you
teach
me
any
other
thing
i
should
like
to
learn
of
you
of
all
things
but
do
think
of
something
else
besides
this
odious
jargon
can
not
you
teach
me
to
read
poetry
elegantly
shakspeare
for
instance
i
doat
upon
shakspeare
that
would
be
strange
presumption
in
a
foreigner
no
presumption
in
the
least
cried
she
if
you
can
do
it
pray
begin
there
is
romeo
and
juliet
thaddeus
pushed
away
the
book
with
a
smile
i
can
not
obey
i
understand
shakspeare
with
as
much
ease
as
you
madam
will
soon
do
schiller
if
you
apply
but
i
can
not
pretend
to
read
the
play
aloud
dear
me
how
vexatious
but
i
must
hear
you
read
something
do
take
up
that
werter
my
sister
got
it
from
the
prussian
ambassador
and
he
tells
me
it
is
sweetest
in
its
own
language
the
count
opened
the
book
but
you
will
not
understand
a
word
of
it
i
do
care
for
that
i
have
it
by
heart
in
english
and
if
you
will
only
read
his
last
letter
to
charlotte
i
know
i
can
follow
you
in
my
own
mind
to
please
this
whimsical
little
creature
thaddeus
turned
to
the
letter
and
read
it
forward
with
a
pathos
natural
to
his
voice
and
character
when
he
came
to
an
end
and
closed
the
volume
the
cadence
of
his
tones
and
the
lady
memory
did
ample
justice
to
her
sensibility
she
looked
up
and
smiling
through
her
watery
eyes
which
glittered
like
violets
wet
with
dew
drew
out
her
perfumed
handkerchief
and
wiping
them
said
i
thank
you
constantine
you
see
by
this
irrepressible
emotion
that
i
feel
goethe
and
did
not
ask
you
a
vain
favor
thaddeus
bowed
for
he
was
at
a
loss
to
guess
what
kind
of
a
reply
could
be
expected
by
so
strange
a
creature
she
continued
you
are
a
german
constantine
did
you
ever
see
charlotte
never
madam
i
am
sorry
for
that
i
should
have
liked
to
have
heard
what
sort
of
a
beauty
she
was
but
do
you
think
she
behaved
cruelly
to
werter
perhaps
you
knew
him
no
madam
this
lamentable
story
happened
before
i
was
born
how
unhappy
for
him
i
am
sure
you
would
have
made
the
most
charming
friends
in
the
world
have
you
a
friend
mr
constantine
the
count
looked
at
her
with
surprise
she
laughed
at
the
expression
of
his
countenance
i
do
mean
such
friends
as
one
father
mother
sisters
and
relations
most
people
have
enough
of
them
i
mean
a
tender
confiding
friend
to
whom
you
unbosom
all
your
secrets
who
is
your
other
self
a
second
soul
in
short
a
creature
in
whose
existence
you
forget
your
own
thaddeus
followed
with
his
eyes
the
heightened
color
of
the
fair
enthusiast
who
accompanying
her
rhapsody
with
action
expressive
as
her
words
had
to
repeat
her
question
have
you
such
a
friend
before
he
found
recollection
to
answer
her
in
the
negative
the
count
who
had
never
been
used
to
such
extravagant
behavior
in
a
woman
would
have
regarded
miss
euphemia
dundas
as
little
better
than
insane
had
he
not
been
prepared
by
miss
egerton
description
and
he
now
acquiesced
in
the
young
lady
desire
to
detain
him
another
hour
half
amused
and
half
wearied
with
her
aimless
and
wild
fancies
but
here
he
was
mistaken
her
fancies
were
not
aimless
his
heart
was
the
game
she
had
in
view
and
she
determined
a
desperate
attack
should
make
it
her
own
in
return
for
the
deep
wounds
she
had
received
from
every
tone
of
his
voice
whilst
reading
the
sorrows
of
werter
chapter
xxiv
lady
tinemouth
boudoir
thaddeus
spent
nearly
a
fortnight
in
the
constant
exercise
of
his
occupations
in
the
forepart
of
each
day
until
two
he
prepared
those
drawings
by
the
sale
of
which
he
was
empowered
every
week
to
pay
the
good
robson
for
her
care
of
his
friend
and
he
hoped
when
the
ladies
in
harley
street
should
think
it
time
to
defray
any
part
of
their
now
large
debt
to
him
he
might
be
enabled
to
liquidate
the
very
long
bill
of
his
friend
apothecary
but
the
misses
dundas
possessed
too
much
money
to
think
of
its
utility
they
used
it
as
counters
for
they
had
no
conception
that
to
other
people
it
might
be
the
purchaser
of
almost
every
comfort
their
comforts
came
so
certainly
they
supposed
they
grew
of
necessity
out
of
their
situation
and
their
great
wealth
owned
no
other
commission
than
to
give
splendid
parties
and
buy
fine
things
their
golden
shower
being
exhaled
by
the
same
vanity
by
which
it
had
been
shed
they
as
little
regarded
its
dispersion
as
they
had
marked
its
descent
hence
these
amiable
ladies
never
once
recollected
that
their
master
ought
to
receive
some
weightier
remuneration
for
his
visits
than
the
honor
of
paying
them
and
as
poets
say
the
highest
honors
are
achieved
by
suffering
so
these
two
sisters
though
in
different
ways
seemed
resolved
that
thaddeus
should
purchase
his
distinction
with
adequate
pains
notwithstanding
that
miss
dundas
continued
very
remiss
in
her
lessons
she
unrelentingly
required
the
count
attendance
and
sometimes
not
in
the
most
gentle
language
reproached
him
for
a
backwardness
in
learning
she
owed
entirely
to
her
own
inattention
and
stupidity
the
fair
diana
would
have
been
the
most
erudite
woman
in
the
world
could
she
have
found
any
path
to
the
temple
of
science
but
the
goddess
who
presides
there
being
only
to
be
won
by
arduous
climbing
poor
miss
dundas
like
the
indolent
monarch
who
made
the
same
demand
of
the
philosophers
was
obliged
to
lay
the
fault
of
her
own
slippery
feet
on
the
weakness
of
her
conductors
as
thaddeus
despised
her
most
heartily
he
bore
from
that
quarter
with
unshaken
equanimity
but
the
pretty
euphemia
was
not
so
easily
managed
she
had
now
completely
given
up
her
fanciful
soul
to
this
prince
in
disguise
and
already
began
to
act
a
thousand
extravagances
without
suspecting
the
object
diana
soon
discovered
that
her
sister
was
in
one
of
her
love
fits
indeed
she
cared
nothing
about
it
and
leaving
her
to
pursue
the
passion
as
she
liked
poor
euphemia
according
to
her
custom
when
laboring
under
this
whimsical
malady
addicted
herself
to
solitude
this
romantic
taste
she
generally
indulged
by
taking
her
footman
to
the
gate
of
the
green
in
cavendish
square
where
he
stood
until
she
had
performed
a
pensive
saunter
up
and
down
the
walk
after
this
she
returned
home
adjusted
her
hair
in
the
madonna
fashion
because
thaddeus
had
one
day
admired
the
female
head
in
a
holy
family
by
guido
over
the
piece
and
then
seating
herself
in
some
becoming
attitude
usually
waited
with
her
eyes
constantly
turning
to
the
door
until
the
object
of
these
devices
presented
himself
she
impatiently
watched
all
his
motions
and
looks
whilst
he
attended
to
her
sister
and
the
moment
that
was
done
she
ran
over
her
own
lessons
with
great
volubility
but
little
attention
her
task
finished
she
shut
the
books
and
employed
the
remainder
of
the
time
in
translating
a
number
of
little
mottoes
into
german
which
she
had
composed
for
boxes
baskets
and
other
frippery
one
day
when
her
young
teacher
was
as
usual
tired
almost
beyond
endurance
with
making
common
sense
out
of
so
much
nonsense
euphemia
observed
that
diana
had
removed
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
with
the
honorable
lascelles
to
give
an
to
her
new
studies
miss
dundas
had
lately
opened
her
library
door
to
morning
visitors
and
seeing
her
sister
thus
engaged
euphemia
thought
she
might
do
what
she
wished
without
detection
hastily
drawing
a
folded
paper
from
her
pocket
she
desired
thaddeus
to
take
it
home
and
translate
it
into
the
language
he
liked
best
surprised
at
her
manner
he
held
it
in
his
hand
put
it
in
your
pocket
added
she
in
a
hurrying
voice
else
my
sister
may
see
it
and
ask
what
it
is
full
of
wonder
he
obeyed
her
and
the
little
beauty
having
executed
her
scheme
seemed
quite
intoxicated
with
delight
when
he
was
preparing
to
withdraw
she
called
to
him
and
asked
when
he
should
visit
lady
tinemouth
this
evening
madam
then
returned
she
tell
her
ladyship
i
shall
come
and
sit
with
her
and
here
added
she
running
up
to
him
present
her
that
rose
with
my
love
whilst
she
put
it
into
his
hand
she
whispered
in
a
low
voice
and
you
will
tell
me
what
you
think
of
the
verses
i
have
given
you
thaddeus
colored
and
bowed
he
hurried
out
of
the
house
into
the
street
as
if
by
that
haste
he
could
have
gotten
out
of
a
dilemma
to
which
he
feared
all
this
foolish
mystery
might
be
only
the
introduction
though
of
all
men
in
the
world
he
was
perhaps
the
least
inclined
to
vanity
yet
he
must
have
been
one
of
the
most
stupid
had
he
not
been
convinced
by
this
time
of
the
dangerous
attachment
of
lady
sara
added
to
that
painful
certainty
he
now
more
than
dreaded
a
similar
though
a
slighter
folly
in
miss
euphemia
can
a
man
see
himself
the
daily
object
of
a
pair
of
melting
eyes
hear
everlasting
sighs
at
his
entrance
and
departure
day
after
day
receive
tender
though
covert
addresses
about
disinterested
love
can
he
witness
all
this
and
be
sincere
when
he
affirms
it
is
the
language
of
indifference
if
that
be
possible
the
count
sobieski
has
no
pretensions
of
modesty
he
comprehended
the
discoursing
of
miss
euphemia
eye
also
the
tendency
of
the
mottoes
which
under
various
excuses
she
put
into
his
hand
and
with
many
a
pitying
smile
of
contempt
he
contemplated
her
childish
absurdity
a
few
days
prior
to
that
in
which
she
made
this
appointment
with
thaddeus
she
had
presented
to
him
another
of
her
posies
which
ran
thus
frighted
love
like
a
wild
beast
shakes
the
wood
in
which
it
hides
thaddeus
almost
laughed
at
the
oddity
of
the
conceit
do
dear
constantine
cried
she
translate
it
into
the
sweetest
french
you
can
for
i
mean
to
have
it
put
into
a
medallion
and
to
give
it
to
the
person
whom
i
most
value
on
earth
there
was
something
so
truly
ridiculous
in
the
sentence
that
reluctant
to
allow
even
miss
euphemia
to
expose
herself
so
far
he
considered
a
moment
how
he
should
make
anything
so
bad
better
and
then
said
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
translate
it
literally
but
surely
madam
you
can
do
it
yourself
yes
but
i
like
your
french
better
than
mine
so
pray
oblige
me
he
had
done
the
same
kind
of
thing
a
hundred
times
for
her
and
without
further
discussion
wrote
as
follows
tel
biche
blessée
se
trahit
par
sa
crainte
qui
fait
remuer
le
feuillage
qui
le
couvre
bless
me
how
pretty
cried
she
and
immediately
put
it
into
her
bosom
to
this
unlucky
addition
of
the
words
trahit
thaddeus
was
indebted
for
the
present
of
the
folded
paper
the
working
imagination
of
euphemia
had
seized
the
inverted
thought
as
a
delicate
avowal
that
he
was
the
wounded
deer
he
had
substituted
in
place
of
the
wild
beast
and
as
soon
is
he
arrived
at
home
he
found
the
fruits
of
her
mistake
in
the
packet
she
had
given
with
so
much
secrecy
when
he
broke
the
seal
something
dropped
out
and
fell
on
the
carpet
he
took
it
up
and
blushed
for
her
on
finding
a
gold
medallion
with
the
words
he
had
altered
for
miss
euphemia
engraved
on
blue
enamel
with
a
vexed
haste
he
next
looked
at
the
envelope
it
contained
a
copy
of
verses
with
this
line
written
at
the
top
to
him
who
will
apply
them
on
perusing
them
he
found
them
to
be
phillips
beautiful
translation
of
that
ode
of
sappho
which
runs
blest
as
the
immortal
gods
is
he
the
friend
who
fondly
sits
by
thee
and
hears
and
sees
thee
all
the
while
softly
speak
and
sweetly
smile
was
this
deprived
my
soul
of
rest
and
rais
such
tumults
in
my
breast
for
while
i
gazed
in
transport
tost
my
breath
was
gone
my
voice
was
lost
my
bosom
glow
the
subtle
flame
ran
quick
through
all
my
vital
frame
my
dim
eyes
a
darkness
hung
my
ears
with
hollow
murmurs
rung
in
dewy
damps
my
limbs
were
chill
my
blood
with
gentle
horrors
thrill
my
feeble
pulse
forgot
to
play
i
fainted
sunk
and
died
away
euphemia
thaddeus
threw
the
verses
and
the
medallion
together
on
the
table
and
sat
for
a
few
minutes
considering
how
he
could
extricate
himself
from
an
affair
so
truly
farcical
in
itself
but
which
might
be
productive
of
a
very
distressing
consequence
to
him
he
was
thinking
of
at
once
giving
up
the
task
of
attending
either
of
the
sisters
when
his
eyes
falling
on
the
uncomplaining
but
melancholy
features
of
his
poor
friend
he
exclaimed
no
for
thy
sake
gallant
butzou
i
will
brave
every
scene
however
abhorrent
to
my
heart
well
aware
from
observation
on
miss
euphemia
that
this
seeming
tenderness
which
prompted
an
act
so
wild
and
unbecoming
originated
in
mere
caprice
ha
did
not
hesitate
in
determining
to
return
the
things
in
as
handsome
a
manner
as
possible
and
by
so
doing
at
once
crush
the
whole
affair
he
felt
no
pain
in
forming
those
resolves
because
he
saw
that
not
one
impulse
of
her
conduct
sprung
from
her
heart
it
was
a
whim
raised
by
him
which
might
be
superseded
by
another
but
how
different
was
the
case
with
regard
to
lady
sara
her
uncontrolled
nature
could
not
long
brook
the
restraints
of
friendship
every
attention
he
gave
to
lady
tinemouth
every
civility
he
paid
to
miss
egerton
or
to
any
other
lady
whom
he
met
at
the
countess
went
like
a
dagger
to
her
soul
and
whenever
she
could
gain
his
ear
in
private
she
generally
made
him
sensible
of
her
misery
and
his
own
unhappiness
in
being
its
cause
by
reproaches
which
too
unequivocally
proclaimed
their
source
he
now
saw
that
she
had
given
way
to
a
reprehensible
and
headstrong
passion
and
allowing
for
the
politeness
which
is
due
to
the
sex
he
tried
by
an
appearance
of
the
most
stubborn
coldness
and
an
obstinate
perversity
in
shutting
his
apprehension
against
all
her
speeches
and
actions
to
stem
a
tide
that
threatened
her
with
ruin
lady
tinemouth
at
least
began
to
open
her
eyes
to
the
perilous
situation
of
both
her
friends
highly
as
she
esteemed
thaddeus
she
knew
not
the
extent
of
his
integrity
she
had
lived
too
long
near
the
circle
of
the
heir
apparent
and
had
seen
too
many
men
from
the
courts
of
the
continent
to
place
much
reliance
on
the
firmness
of
a
single
and
unattached
young
man
when
assailed
by
rank
beauty
and
love
alarmed
at
what
might
be
the
result
of
her
observations
and
fearing
to
lose
any
time
she
had
that
very
evening
in
winch
she
expected
thaddeus
to
supper
drawn
out
of
lady
sara
the
unhappy
state
of
her
heart
the
dreadful
confession
was
made
by
her
ladyship
with
repeated
showers
of
tears
and
in
paroxysms
of
agony
which
pierced
the
countess
to
the
soul
my
dear
lady
sara
cried
she
for
heaven
sake
remember
your
duty
to
captain
ross
i
shall
never
forget
it
exclaimed
her
ladyship
shaking
her
head
mournfully
and
striking
her
breast
with
her
clenched
hand
i
never
look
on
the
face
of
constantine
that
i
do
not
execrate
from
my
heart
the
vows
which
i
have
sworn
to
ross
but
i
have
bound
myself
his
property
and
though
i
hate
him
whatever
it
may
cost
me
i
will
never
forget
that
my
faith
and
honor
are
my
husband
with
a
countenance
bathed
in
tears
lady
tinemouth
put
her
arms
round
the
waist
of
lady
sara
who
now
sat
motionless
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
dear
lady
sara
that
was
spoken
like
yourself
do
more
abstain
from
seeing
mr
constantine
do
require
of
me
that
cried
she
i
could
easier
rid
myself
of
existence
he
is
the
very
essence
of
my
happiness
it
is
only
in
his
company
that
i
forget
that
i
am
a
wretch
this
is
obstinacy
my
dear
lady
sara
this
is
courting
danger
lady
tinemouth
urge
me
no
more
is
it
not
enough
continued
she
sullenly
that
i
am
miserable
would
you
drive
me
to
desperation
if
there
be
danger
you
brought
me
into
it
i
lady
sara
yes
you
lady
tinemouth
you
introduced
him
to
me
but
you
are
married
singularly
attractive
and
amiable
as
indeed
he
is
could
i
suppose
nonsense
cried
her
ladyship
interrupting
her
you
know
that
i
am
married
to
a
mere
sailor
more
in
love
with
his
ugly
ship
than
with
me
but
it
is
not
because
constantine
is
so
handsome
that
i
like
him
no
though
no
human
form
can
come
nearer
to
perfection
yet
it
was
not
that
it
was
you
you
and
sophia
egerton
were
always
telling
me
of
his
bravery
what
wealth
and
honors
he
had
sacrificed
in
the
service
of
his
country
how
nobly
he
succored
the
distresses
of
others
how
heedless
he
was
of
his
own
this
fired
my
imagination
and
won
my
heart
no
it
was
not
his
personal
attractions
i
am
not
so
despicable
dear
lady
sara
be
calm
entreated
the
countess
completely
at
a
loss
how
to
manage
a
spirit
of
such
violence
think
my
dear
friend
what
horrors
you
would
experience
if
constantine
were
to
discover
this
predilection
and
presume
upon
it
you
know
where
even
the
best
men
are
vulnerable
the
eyes
of
lady
sara
sparkled
with
pleasure
why
surely
lady
sara
exclaimed
lady
tinemouth
doubtingly
do
fear
me
lady
tinemouth
i
know
my
own
dignity
too
well
to
do
anything
disgraceful
yet
i
would
acquire
the
knowledge
that
he
loves
me
at
almost
any
price
but
he
is
cold
added
she
he
is
a
piece
of
obstinate
petrefaction
which
heaven
itself
could
not
melt
lady
tinemouth
was
glad
to
hear
this
account
of
thaddeus
but
ere
she
could
reply
the
door
opened
and
miss
euphemia
dundas
was
announced
when
the
little
beauty
expressed
her
amazement
at
not
seeing
constantine
lady
sara
gave
her
such
a
withering
look
that
had
her
ladyship
eyes
been
medusan
poor
euphemia
would
have
stood
there
forever
after
a
stone
statue
of
disappointment

the

of

story
meanwhile
the
count
having
seen
cavendish
and
received
a
favorable
opinion
of
his
friend
wrote
the
following
note
to
miss
euphemia
to
miss
euphemia
dundas
constantine
very
much
admires
the
taste
of
miss
euphemia
dundas
in
her
choice
of
the
verses
which
she
did
him
the
honor
of
requesting
he
would
translate
into
the
most
expressive
language
and
to
the
utmost
of
his
abilities
he
has
obeyed
her
commands
in
italian
thinking
that
language
the
best
adapted
to
the
versification
of
the
original
constantine
equally
admires
the
style
of
the
medallion
which
miss
dundas
has
condescended
to
enclose
for
his
inspection
and
assures
her
the
letters
are
correct
having
sealed
his
note
and
seen
the
general
in
bed
with
little
nanny
seated
by
him
to
watch
his
slumbers
thaddeus
pursued
his
way
to
grosvenor
place
when
he
entered
lady
tinemouth
he
saw
that
his
young
had
already
arrived
and
was
in
close
conversation
with
the
countess
lady
sara
seated
alone
on
a
sofa
inwardly
upbraided
constantine
for
what
she
thought
an
absolute
assignation
with
euphemia
her
eyes
yet
dewed
with
the
tears
which
her
discourse
with
lady
tinemouth
had
occasioned
sought
his
averted
face
while
he
looked
at
miss
dundas
with
evident
surprise
and
disgust
this
pleased
her
and
the
more
so
as
he
only
bowed
to
her
rival
shook
the
countess
by
the
hand
and
then
turning
took
his
station
beside
herself
on
the
sofa
she
would
not
trust
her
triumphant
eyes
towards
lady
tinemouth
but
immediately
asked
him
some
trifling
question
at
the
same
moment
euphemia
tapped
him
on
the
arm
with
her
fan
and
inquired
how
it
happened
that
she
had
arrived
first
he
was
answering
lady
sara
euphemia
impatiently
repeated
her
demand
how
did
it
happen
that
i
arrived
first
i
suppose
madam
replied
he
smiling
because
you
were
so
fortunate
as
to
set
out
first
but
had
i
been
so
happy
as
to
have
preceded
you
the
message
and
present
with
which
i
was
honored
would
have
been
faithfully
delivered
and
i
hope
your
ladyship
will
permit
me
to
do
it
now
said
he
rising
and
taking
euphemia
rose
from
his
button
as
he
approached
the
countess
miss
euphemia
dundas
had
done
me
the
honor
to
make
me
the
bearer
of
sweets
to
the
sweet
and
thus
i
surrender
my
trust
he
bowed
and
put
the
flower
into
lady
tinemouth
hand
who
smiled
and
thanked
euphemia
but
the
little
beauty
blushed
like
her
own
rose
and
murmuring
within
herself
at
the
literal
apprehension
of
her
favorite
whom
she
thought
as
handsome
as
cimon
and
as
stupid
too
she
flirted
her
fan
and
asked
miss
egerton
whether
she
had
read
charlotte
smith
last
delightful
novel
the
evening
passed
off
more
agreeably
to
thaddeus
than
he
had
augured
on
his
entrance
lady
sara
always
embarrassed
and
pained
him
miss
euphemia
teased
him
to
death
but
the
storm
which
had
agitated
the
breast
of
her
ladyship
having
subsided
into
thoughtfulness
it
imparted
so
abstracted
an
air
to
her
countenance
that
merely
to
elude
communication
with
euphemia
he
remained
near
her
and
by
paying
those
attentions
which
so
situated
he
could
not
avoid
he
so
deluded
the
wretched
lady
sara
as
to
subdue
her
melancholy
into
an
enchanting
softness
which
to
any
other
man
might
have
rendered
her
the
most
captivating
woman
on
earth
the
only
person
present
who
did
not
approve
this
change
was
lady
tinemouth
at
every
dissolving
smile
of
her
circean
ladyship
she
thought
she
beheld
the
intoxicating
cup
at
the
lips
of
thaddeus
and
dreaded
its
effect
euphemia
was
too
busily
employed
repeating
some
new
poems
and
too
intensely
dreaming
of
what
her
tutor
might
say
on
the
verses
and
medallion
in
his
possession
to
observe
the
dangerous
ascendency
which
the
superior
charms
of
lady
sara
might
acquire
over
his
heart
indeed
she
had
no
suspicion
of
finding
a
rival
in
her
ladyship
and
when
a
servant
announced
the
arrival
of
her
coach
and
she
saw
by
her
watch
that
it
was
twelve
she
arose
reluctantly
exclaiming
i
dare
say
some
plaguing
people
have
arrived
who
are
to
stay
with
us
else
mamma
would
not
have
sent
for
me
so
soon
i
call
it
late
said
lady
sara
who
would
not
lose
an
opportunity
of
contradicting
her
so
i
will
thank
you
mr
constantine
addressing
herself
to
him
to
hand
me
to
my
coach
at
the
same
time
euphemia
bit
her
lip
at
this
movement
of
her
ladyship
and
followed
her
down
stairs
reddening
with
anger
her
carriage
being
first
she
was
obliged
to
get
into
it
but
would
not
suffer
the
servant
to
close
the
door
until
she
had
seen
lady
sara
seated
in
hers
and
then
she
called
to
constantine
to
speak
with
her
lady
sara
leaned
her
head
out
of
the
window
while
she
saw
the
man
she
loved
approach
lady
dundas
carriage
she
in
her
turn
bit
her
lips
with
vexation
home
my
lady
asked
the
servant
touching
his
hat
no
not
till
miss
dundas
coach
drives
on
miss
euphemia
desired
thaddeus
to
step
in
for
a
moment
and
he
reluctantly
obeyed
mr
constantine
cried
the
pretty
simpleton
trembling
with
expectation
as
she
made
room
for
him
beside
her
have
you
opened
the
paper
i
gave
you
yes
madam
returned
he
holding
the
door
open
and
widening
it
with
one
hand
whilst
with
the
other
he
presented
his
note
and
i
have
the
honor
in
that
paper
to
have
executed
your
commands
euphemia
caught
it
eagerly
and
thaddeus
immediately
leaping
out
wished
her
a
and
hurried
back
into
the
house
whilst
the
carriages
drove
away
he
ascended
to
the
to
take
leave
of
the
countess
lady
tinemouth
seated
on
the
sofa
was
leaning
thoughtfully
against
one
of
its
arms
when
he
he
approached
her
i
wish
you
a
lady
tinemouth
she
turned
her
head
constantine
i
wish
you
would
stay
a
little
longer
with
me
my
spirits
are
disturbed
and
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
near
morning
before
sophia
returns
from
richmond
these
rural
balls
are
sad
dissipated
amusements
thaddeus
laid
down
his
hat
and
took
a
seat
by
her
side
i
am
happy
dear
lady
tinemouth
at
all
times
to
be
with
you
but
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
you
have
met
with
any
thing
to
discompose
you
i
was
afraid
when
i
came
in
that
something
disagreeable
had
happened
your
eyes
alas
if
my
eyes
were
always
to
show
when
i
have
been
weeping
they
might
ever
be
telling
tales
her
ladyship
passed
her
hand
across
them
while
she
added
we
may
think
on
our
sorrows
with
an
outward
air
of
tranquillity
but
we
can
not
always
speak
of
them
without
some
agitation
ah
lady
tinemouth
exclaimed
the
count
drawing
closer
to
her
could
not
even
your
generous
sympathizing
heart
escape
calamity
to
cherish
a
sympathizing
heart
my
young
friend
replied
she
is
not
a
very
effectual
way
to
avoid
the
pressure
of
affliction
on
the
reverse
such
a
temper
extracts
unhappiness
from
causes
which
would
fail
to
extort
even
a
sigh
from
dispositions
of
less
susceptibility
ideas
of
sensibility
and
sympathy
are
pretty
toys
for
a
novice
to
play
with
but
change
those
wooden
swords
into
weapons
of
real
metal
and
you
will
find
the
points
through
your
heart
before
you
are
aware
of
the
danger
at
least
i
find
it
so
constantine
i
have
frequently
promised
to
explain
to
you
the
reason
of
the
sadness
which
so
often
tinges
my
conversation
and
i
know
not
when
i
shall
be
in
a
fitter
humor
to
indulge
myself
at
your
expense
for
i
never
was
more
wretched
never
stood
more
in
need
of
the
consolations
of
a
friend
she
covered
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
and
remained
so
for
some
time
thaddeus
pressed
her
hand
several
times
and
waited
in
respectful
silence
until
she
recommenced
forgive
me
my
dear
sir
i
am
very
low
very
nervous
having
encountered
two
or
three
distressing
circumstances
these
tears
relieve
me
you
have
heard
me
speak
of
my
son
and
of
my
lord
yet
i
never
collected
resolution
to
recount
how
we
were
separated
this
morning
i
saw
my
son
pass
my
window
he
looked
up
but
the
moment
i
appeared
he
turned
away
and
hastened
down
the
street
though
i
have
received
many
stronger
proofs
of
dislike
both
from
his
father
and
himself
yet
slight
as
this
offence
may
seem
it
pierced
me
to
the
soul
o
constantine
to
know
that
the
child
to
whom
i
gave
life
regards
me
with
abhorrence
is
dreadful
is
beyond
even
the
anxious
partiality
of
a
mother
either
to
excuse
or
to
palliate
perhaps
dear
lady
tinemouth
you
misjudge
lord
harwold
he
may
be
under
the
commands
of
his
father
and
yet
yearn
to
show
you
his
affection
and
duty
no
mr
constantine
your
heart
is
too
good
even
to
guess
what
may
be
the
guilt
of
another
gracious
heaven
am
i
obliged
to
speak
so
of
my
son
he
who
was
my
darling
he
who
once
loved
me
so
dearly
but
hear
me
my
dear
sir
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
and
you
will
wonder
that
i
am
now
alive
to
endure
more
i
have
suffered
by
him
by
his
father
and
by
a
dreadful
woman
who
not
only
tore
my
husband
and
children
from
me
but
stood
by
till
i
was
beaten
to
the
ground
yes
constantine
any
humane
man
would
shudder
as
you
do
at
such
an
assertion
but
it
is
too
true
soon
after
lady
olivia
lovel
became
the
mistress
of
my
lord
and
persuaded
him
to
take
my
son
from
me
i
heard
that
the
poor
boy
had
fallen
ill
through
grief
and
lay
sick
at
his
lordship
house
in
hampshire
i
heard
he
was
dying
imagine
my
agonies
wild
with
distress
i
flew
to
the
park
lodge
and
forgetful
of
anything
but
my
child
was
hastening
across
the
park
when
i
saw
this
woman
this
lady
olivia
approaching
me
followed
by
two
female
servants
one
of
them
carried
my
daughter
then
an
infant
in
her
arms
and
the
other
a
child
of
which
this
unnatural
wretch
had
recently
become
the
mother
i
was
flying
towards
my
little
albina
to
clasp
her
to
my
heart
when
lady
olivia
caught
hold
of
my
arm
her
voice
now
rings
in
my
ears
cried
she
this
place
there
are
none
here
to
whom
you
are
not
an
object
of
abhorrence
struggling
to
break
from
her
i
implored
to
be
permitted
to
embrace
my
child
but
she
held
me
fast
and
regardless
of
my
cries
ordered
both
the
women
to
return
into
the
house
driven
to
despair
i
dropped
on
my
knees
conjuring
her
by
her
feelings
as
a
mother
to
allow
me
for
one
moment
to
see
my
dying
son
and
that
i
would
promise
by
my
hopes
of
everlasting
happiness
to
cherish
her
child
as
my
own
should
it
ever
stand
in
need
of
a
friend
the
horrid
woman
only
laughed
at
my
prayers
and
left
me
in
a
swoon
when
i
recovered
the
first
objects
i
beheld
were
my
lord
and
lady
olivia
standing
near
me
and
myself
in
the
arms
of
a
whom
they
had
commanded
to
carry
me
outside
the
gate
at
the
sight
of
my
husband
i
sprang
to
his
feet
when
with
one
dreadful
blow
of
his
hand
he
struck
me
to
the
ground
merciful
providence
how
did
i
retain
my
senses
i
besought
this
cruel
husband
to
give
me
a
second
blow
that
i
might
suffer
no
more
her
out
of
my
sight
cried
he
is
mad
i
was
taken
out
of
his
sight
more
dead
than
alive
and
led
by
his
pitying
servants
to
an
inn
where
i
was
afterwards
confined
for
three
weeks
with
a
brain
fever
from
that
hour
i
have
never
had
a
day
of
health
thaddeus
was
shocked
beyond
utterance
at
this
relation
the
paleness
of
his
countenance
being
the
only
reply
he
made
the
anguished
narrator
resumed
i
have
gone
out
of
order
i
proposed
to
inform
you
clearly
of
my
situation
but
the
principal
outrage
of
my
heart
rose
immediately
to
my
lips
i
will
commence
regularly
if
i
can
methodize
my
recollection
the
earl
of
tinemouth
married
me
from
passion
i
will
not
sanctify
his
emotions
by
the
name
of
affection
though
added
she
forcing
a
smile
these
faded
features
too
plainly
show
that
of
all
mankind
i
loved
but
him
alone
i
was
just
fifteen
when
he
came
to
visit
my
father
who
lived
in
berkshire
my
father
cumnor
and
his
father
lord
harwold
had
been
friends
at
college
my
lord
then
stanhope
was
young
handsome
and
captivating
he
remained
the
autumn
with
us
and
at
the
end
of
that
period
declared
an
affection
for
me
which
my
heart
too
readily
answered
about
this
time
he
received
a
summons
from
his
father
and
we
parted
like
most
girls
of
my
age
i
cherished
an
unconquerable
bashfulness
against
admitting
any
confidant
to
my
attachment
hence
my
parents
knew
nothing
of
the
affair
until
it
burst
upon
them
in
the
cruelest
shape
about
two
months
after
stanhope
departure
a
letter
arrived
from
him
urging
me
to
fly
with
him
to
scotland
he
alleged
as
a
reason
for
such
a
step
that
his
grandfather
the
earl
of
tinemouth
insisted
on
his
forming
a
union
with
lady
olivia
lovel
who
was
then
a
young
widow
and
the
favorite
niece
of
the
most
powerful
nobleman
in
the
kingdom
upon
this
demand
he
confessed
to
the
earl
that
his
affections
were
engaged
his
lordship
whose
passions
were
those
of
a
madman
broke
into
such
horrible
execrations
of
myself
and
my
family
that
stanhope
himself
alas
enraged
intemperately
swore
that
no
power
on
earth
should
compel
him
to
marry
so
notorious
a
woman
as
lady
olivia
lovel
nor
to
give
me
up
after
communicating
these
particulars
he
concluded
with
repeating
his
entreaties
that
i
would
consent
to
marry
him
in
scotland
the
whole
of
this
letter
so
alarmed
me
that
i
showed
it
to
my
parents
my
father
answered
it
in
a
manner
befitting
his
own
character
but
that
only
irritated
the
impetuous
passions
of
my
lover
in
the
paroxysm
of
his
rage
he
flew
to
the
earl
his
grandfather
upbraided
him
with
the
ruin
of
his
happiness
and
so
exasperated
the
old
man
that
he
drew
his
sword
upon
him
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
interference
of
his
father
lord
harwold
who
happened
to
enter
at
the
moment
a
most
fatal
catastrophe
might
have
ensued
to
end
the
affair
at
once
the
latter
whose
gentle
nature
embraced
the
mildest
measures
obtained
the
earl
permission
to
send
stanhope
abroad
meanwhile
i
was
upheld
by
my
revered
parent
who
is
now
no
more
in
firmly
rejecting
my
lover
entreaties
for
a
private
marriage
and
as
his
grandfather
continued
resolutely
deaf
to
his
prayers
or
threats
he
was
at
length
persuaded
by
his
excellent
father
to
accompany
some
friends
to
france
at
the
end
of
a
few
weeks
stanhope
began
to
regard
them
as
spies
on
him
and
after
a
violent
quarrel
they
parted
no
one
knowing
to
what
quarter
my
lover
directed
his
steps
i
believe
i
was
the
first
who
heard
any
tidings
of
him
i
remember
well
it
was
in
about
years
ago
that
i
received
a
letter
from
him
oh
how
legibly
are
these
circumstances
written
on
my
memory
it
was
dated
from
italy
where
he
told
me
he
resided
in
complete
retirement
under
the
assumed
name
of
sackville
at
this
name
with
every
feature
fixed
in
dismay
thaddeus
fell
back
on
the
sofa
the
countess
caught
his
hand
what
is
the
matter
you
are
ill
what
is
the
matter
the
bolt
of
indelible
disgrace
had
struck
to
his
heart
it
was
some
minutes
before
he
could
recover
but
when
he
did
speak
he
said
pray
go
on
madam
i
am
subject
to
this
pray
forgive
me
and
go
on
i
shall
become
better
as
you
proceed
no
my
dear
friend
i
will
quit
my
dismal
story
at
present
and
resume
it
some
other
time
pray
continue
it
now
rejoined
thaddeus
i
shall
never
be
more
fit
to
listen
do
i
entreat
you
are
you
sincere
in
your
request
i
fear
i
have
already
affected
you
too
much
no
i
am
sincere
let
me
hear
it
all
do
not
hold
back
anything
which
relates
to
that
stain
to
the
name
of
englishman
who
completed
his
crimes
by
rendering
you
wretched
alas
he
did
resumed
her
ladyship
for
when
he
returned
which
was
in
consequence
of
the
earl
of
tinemouth
death
my
father
was
also
dead
who
might
have
stood
between
me
and
my
inclinations
and
so
preserved
me
from
many
succeeding
sorrows
i
sealed
my
fate
and
became
stanhope
wife
the
father
of
my
husband
was
then
earl
of
tinemouth
and
as
he
had
never
been
averse
to
our
union
he
presented
me
with
a
cottage
on
the
banks
of
the
wye
where
i
passed
three
delightful
years
the
happiest
of
womankind
my
husband
my
mother
and
my
infant
son
formed
my
felicity
and
greatly
i
prize
it
too
greatly
to
be
allowed
a
long
continuance
at
the
end
of
this
period
some
gay
friends
paid
us
a
visit
when
they
returned
to
town
they
persuaded
my
lord
to
be
of
the
party
he
went
and
from
that
fatal
day
all
my
sufferings
arose
lord
harwold
instead
of
being
with
me
in
a
fortnight
as
he
had
promised
procrastinated
his
absence
under
various
excuses
from
week
to
week
during
which
interval
my
albina
was
born
day
after
day
i
anticipated
the
delight
of
putting
her
into
the
arms
of
her
father
but
what
a
chasm
she
was
three
months
old
before
he
appeared
and
ah
how
changed
he
was
gloomy
to
me
uncivil
to
my
mother
and
hardly
looked
at
the
child
lady
tinemouth
stopped
at
this
part
of
her
narrative
to
wipe
away
her
tears
thaddeus
was
sitting
forward
to
the
table
leaning
on
his
arm
with
his
hand
covering
his
face
the
countess
was
grateful
for
an
excess
of
sympathy
she
did
not
expect
and
taking
his
other
hand
as
it
lay
motionless
on
his
knee
what
a
consolation
would
it
be
to
me
exclaimed
she
durst
i
entertain
a
hope
that
i
may
one
day
behold
but
half
such
pity
from
my
own
son
thaddeus
pressed
her
hand
he
did
not
venture
to
reply
he
could
not
tell
her
that
she
deceived
herself
even
here
that
it
was
not
her
sorrows
only
which
so
affected
him
but
the
remembered
agonies
of
his
own
mother
whom
he
did
not
doubt
the
capricious
villany
of
this
very
earl
under
the
name
of
sackville
a
name
that
had
struck
like
a
to
the
heart
of
thaddeus
when
he
first
heard
his
mother
utter
it
had
devoted
to
a
life
of
uncomplaining
but
ceaseless
reproach
and
had
he
derived
his
existence
from
such
a
man
the
reprobate
husband
of
lady
tinemouth
the
conviction
humbled
him
crushed
him
and
trod
him
to
the
earth
he
did
not
look
up
and
the
countess
resumed
it
would
be
impossible
my
dear
sir
to
describe
to
you
the
gradual
changes
which
assured
me
that
i
had
lost
the
heart
of
my
husband
before
the
end
of
the
winter
he
left
me
again
and
i
saw
him
no
more
until
that
frightful
hour
in
which
he
struck
me
to
the
ground
the
good
earl
came
into
monmouthshire
about
six
weeks
after
i
parted
with
my
lord
i
was
surprised
and
rejoiced
to
see
my
kind
law
but
how
soon
were
my
emotions
driven
into
a
different
course
he
revealed
to
me
that
during
lord
harwold
first
visit
to
town
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
spending
entire
evenings
with
lady
olivia
lovel
woman
added
he
the
most
artful
of
her
sex
in
spite
of
her
acknowledged
dishonor
you
well
know
my
deceased
father
would
gladly
have
married
her
to
my
son
and
now
it
seems
actuated
by
revenge
she
resents
lord
harwold
refusal
of
her
hand
by
seducing
him
from
his
wife
alas
i
am
too
well
convinced
that
the
errors
of
my
son
bear
too
strict
a
resemblance
to
those
of
his
grandfather
vain
of
his
superior
abilities
and
impatient
of
contradiction
flattery
can
mould
him
to
what
it
pleases
lady
olivia
had
discovered
these
weak
points
in
his
character
and
i
am
informed
she
soon
persuaded
him
that
you
impose
on
his
affection
by
detaining
him
from
the
world
and
seconded
by
other
fascinations
my
deluded
son
has
accompanied
her
into
spain
you
may
imagine
constantine
my
distraction
at
this
intelligence
i
was
like
one
lost
and
the
venerable
earl
fearing
to
trust
me
in
such
despair
out
of
his
sight
brought
me
and
my
children
with
him
to
london
in
less
than
four
months
afterwards
i
was
deprived
of
this
inestimable
friend
by
a
paralytic
stroke
his
death
summoned
the
new
earl
to
england
whilst
i
lay
on
a
sick
bed
into
which
i
had
been
thrown
by
the
shock
of
my
protector
death
my
lord
and
his
mistress
arrived
in
london
they
immediately
assumed
the
command
of
my
lamented
house
and
ordered
my
mother
to
clear
it
directly
of
me
my
broken
parent
obeyed
and
i
was
carried
in
a
senseless
state
to
a
lodging
in
the
nearest
street
but
when
this
dear
mother
returned
for
my
children
neither
of
them
were
permitted
to
see
her
the
malignant
lady
olivia
actuated
by
an
insatiable
hatred
of
me
easily
wrought
on
my
frantic
husband
for
i
must
believe
him
mad
to
detain
them
entirely
a
short
time
after
this
that
dreadful
scene
happened
which
i
have
before
described
year
succeeded
year
during
which
time
i
received
many
cruel
insults
from
my
husband
many
horrible
ones
from
my
son
for
i
had
been
advised
to
institute
a
suit
against
my
lord
in
which
i
only
pleaded
for
the
return
of
my
children
i
lost
my
cause
owing
i
hope
to
bad
counsel
not
the
laws
of
my
country
i
was
adjudged
to
be
separated
from
the
earl
with
a
maintenance
of
six
hundred
which
he
hardly
pays
i
was
tied
down
never
to
speak
to
him
nor
to
his
son
nor
his
daughter
though
this
sentence
was
passed
i
never
acknowledged
its
justice
but
wrote
several
times
to
my
children
lord
harwold
who
is
too
deeply
infected
with
his
father
cruelty
has
either
returned
my
letters
unopened
or
with
insulting
replies
for
my
daughter
she
keeps
an
undeviating
silence
and
i
have
not
even
seen
her
since
the
moment
in
which
she
was
hurried
from
my
eyes
in
tinemouth
park
in
vain
her
brother
tries
to
convince
me
that
she
detests
me
i
will
not
believe
it
and
the
hope
that
should
i
survive
her
father
i
may
yet
embrace
my
child
has
been
and
will
be
my
source
of
maternal
comfort
until
it
be
fulfilled
or
i
bury
my
disappointment
in
the
grave
lady
tinemouth
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
which
were
again
flowing
with
tears
thaddeus
thought
he
must
speak
if
he
would
not
betray
an
interest
in
her
narrative
which
he
determined
no
circumstance
should
ever
humble
him
to
reveal
raising
his
head
from
his
hand
he
unconsciously
discovered
to
the
countess
his
agonized
countenance
kind
affectionate
constantine
surely
such
a
heart
as
thine
never
would
bring
sorrow
to
the
breast
of
a
virtuous
husband
you
could
never
betray
the
lady
sara
to
any
fatal
error
lady
tinemouth
did
not
utter
these
thoughts
thaddeus
rose
from
his
seat
farewell
my
honored
friend
said
he
may
heaven
bless
you
and
pardon
your
husband
then
grasping
her
hand
with
what
he
intended
should
be
a
pressure
of
friendship
but
which
his
internal
tortures
rendered
almost
intolerable
he
hastened
down
stairs
opened
the
outward
door
and
got
into
the
street
unknowing
and
heedless
whither
he
went
with
the
steps
of
a
man
driven
by
the
furies
he
traversed
one
street
and
then
another
as
he
went
along
in
vain
the
watchmen
reminded
him
by
their
cries
that
it
was
past
three
he
still
wandered
on
forgetting
that
it
was
night
that
he
had
any
home
any
destination
his
father
was
discovered
that
father
of
whom
he
had
entertained
a
latent
hope
should
they
ever
meet
that
he
might
produce
some
excuse
for
having
been
betrayed
into
an
act
disgraceful
to
a
man
of
honor
but
when
all
these
filial
dreams
were
blasted
by
the
conviction
that
he
owed
his
being
to
the
husband
of
lady
tinemouth
that
his
mother
was
the
victim
of
a
profligate
that
he
had
sprung
from
a
man
who
was
not
merely
a
villain
but
the
most
wanton
the
most
despicable
of
villains
he
saw
himself
bereft
of
hope
and
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
horror
full
of
reflections
which
none
other
than
a
son
in
such
circumstances
can
conceive
he
was
lost
amidst
the
obscure
alleys
of
tottenham
court
yard
when
loud
and
frequent
cries
recalled
his
attention
a
quantity
of
smoke
with
flashes
of
light
led
him
to
suppose
that
they
were
occasioned
by
a
fire
and
a
few
steps
further
the
awful
spectacle
burst
upon
his
sight
it
was
a
house
from
the
windows
of
which
the
flames
were
breaking
out
in
every
direction
whilst
a
gathering
concourse
of
people
were
either
standing
in
stupefied
astonishment
or
uselessly
shouting
for
engines
and
assistance
at
the
moment
in
which
he
arrived
two
or
three
naked
wretches
just
escaped
from
their
beds
were
flying
from
side
to
side
making
the
air
echo
with
their
shrieks
will
nobody
save
my
children
cried
one
of
them
approaching
thaddeus
and
wringing
her
hands
in
agony
will
nobody
take
them
from
the
fire
where
shall
i
seek
them
replied
he
oh
in
that
room
exclaimed
she
pointing
the
flames
are
already
there
they
will
be
burnt
they
will
be
burnt
the
poor
woman
was
hurrying
madly
forward
when
the
count
stopped
her
and
giving
her
in
charge
of
a
bystander
cried
take
care
of
this
woman
if
possible
i
will
save
her
children
darting
through
the
open
door
in
defiance
of
the
smoke
and
danger
he
made
his
way
to
the
children
room
where
almost
suffocated
by
the
sulphurous
cloud
that
surrounded
him
he
at
last
found
the
bed
but
it
contained
one
child
only
this
he
instantly
caught
up
in
his
arms
and
was
hastening
down
the
stairs
when
the
cries
of
the
other
from
a
distant
part
of
the
building
made
him
hesitate
but
thinking
it
better
to
secure
one
than
to
hazard
both
by
lingering
he
rushed
into
the
street
just
as
a
had
stopped
to
inquire
the
particulars
of
the
accident
the
being
open
thaddeus
seeing
ladies
in
it
without
saying
a
word
threw
the
sleeping
infant
into
their
laps
and
hastened
back
into
the
house
where
he
hoped
to
rescue
the
other
child
before
the
fire
could
increase
to
warrant
despair
the
flames
having
now
made
dreadful
progress
his
face
hands
and
clothes
were
scorched
by
their
fury
as
he
flew
from
the
room
following
the
shrieks
of
the
child
who
seemed
to
change
its
situation
with
every
exertion
that
he
made
to
reach
it
at
length
when
every
moment
he
expected
the
house
would
sink
under
his
feet
as
a
last
attempt
he
directed
his
steps
along
a
passage
he
had
not
before
observed
and
to
his
great
joy
beheld
the
object
of
his
search
flying
down
a
back
staircase
the
boy
sprung
into
his
arms
and
thaddeus
turning
round
leaped
from
one
to
another
until
he
found
himself
again
in
the
street
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
people
he
saw
the
poor
mother
clasp
this
second
rescued
child
to
her
breast
and
whilst
the
spectators
were
loading
her
with
congratulations
he
slipped
away
unseen
and
proceeded
homewards
with
a
warmth
at
his
heart
which
made
him
forget
in
the
joy
of
a
benevolent
action
that
petrifying
shock
which
had
been
occasioned
by
the
vices
of
one
too
nearly
allied
to
his
being
to
be
hated
without
horror
chapter
xxvi
the
kindredship
of
minds
when
thaddeus
awoke
next
morning
he
found
himself
more
refreshed
and
freer
from
the
effects
of
the
last
night
discovery
than
he
could
have
reasonably
hoped
the
presence
of
mind
and
activity
which
the
fire
called
on
him
to
exert
having
forced
his
thoughts
into
a
different
channel
had
afforded
his
nerves
an
opportunity
to
regain
some
portion
of
their
usual
strength
he
could
now
reflect
on
what
he
had
heard
without
suffering
the
crimes
of
another
to
lay
him
on
the
rack
the
reins
were
again
restored
to
his
hand
and
neither
agitation
nor
anxiety
showed
themselves
in
his
face
or
manner
though
the
count
sensibility
was
very
irritable
and
when
suddenly
excited
he
could
not
always
conceal
his
emotion
yet
he
possessed
a
power
of
look
which
immediately
repressed
the
impertinence
of
curiosity
or
insolence
indeed
this
mantle
of
repulsion
proved
to
be
his
best
shield
for
never
had
man
more
demands
on
the
dignity
of
his
soul
to
shine
out
about
his
person
not
unfrequently
has
his
sudden
appearance
in
the
at
lady
dundas
at
once
called
a
natural
glow
through
the
ladies
rouge
and
silenced
the
gentlemen
when
he
has
happened
to
enter
while
miss
dundas
and
other
beaux
and
belles
have
been
ridiculing
euphemia
on
the
absurd
civilities
she
paid
to
her
the
morning
after
the
fire
a
little
bevy
of
these
fashionable
butterflies
were
collected
in
this
way
at
one
corner
of
miss
hercules
table
when
during
a
moment
pause
i
hope
miss
beaufort
cried
the
honorable
lascelles
i
hope
you
do
intend
to
consume
the
brightness
of
your
eyes
over
this
stupid
language
what
language
mr
lascelles
inquired
she
i
have
this
moment
entered
the
room
and
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
good
lud
that
is
very
true
cried
he
i
mean
a
shocking
jargon
which
a
shocking
penseroso
man
teaches
to
these
ladies
we
want
to
persuade
miss
euphemia
that
it
spoils
her
mouth
you
are
always
misconceiving
me
lascelles
interrupted
miss
dundus
impatiently
i
did
not
advance
one
word
against
the
language
i
merely
remonstrated
with
phemy
against
her
preposterous
attentions
to
the
man
we
hire
to
teach
it
that
was
what
i
meant
madam
resumed
he
with
a
low
bow
you
meant
what
sir
demanded
the
little
beauty
contemptuously
but
i
need
not
ask
you
are
like
a
bad
mirror
which
from
radical
defect
always
gives
false
reflections
very
good
faith
miss
euphemia
i
declare
sterling
wit
it
would
honor
sheridan
or
your
sister
lascelles
cried
euphemia
more
vexed
than
before
let
me
tell
you
such
impertinence
is
very
unbecoming
a
gentleman
upon
my
soul
miss
euphemia
pray
allow
the
petulant
young
lady
to
get
out
of
her
airs
as
she
has
i
believe
got
out
of
her
senses
without
our
help
exclaimed
miss
dundas
for
i
declare
i
know
not
where
she
picked
up
these
vile
democratic
ideas
i
am
not
a
democrat
diana
answered
euphemia
rising
from
her
seat
and
i
wo
stay
to
be
abused
when
i
know
it
is
all
envy
because
constantine
happened
to
say
that
i
have
a
quicker
memory
than
you
have
she
left
the
room
as
she
ended
miss
dundas
ready
to
storm
with
passion
but
striving
to
conceal
it
burst
into
a
violent
laugh
and
turning
to
miss
beaufort
said
you
now
see
my
dear
mary
a
sad
specimen
of
euphemia
temper
yet
i
hope
you
wo
think
too
severely
of
her
for
poor
thing
she
has
been
spoilt
by
us
all
pray
do
not
apologize
to
me
in
particular
replied
miss
beaufort
but
to
be
frank
i
think
it
probable
she
would
have
shown
her
temper
less
had
that
little
admonition
been
given
in
private
i
doubt
not
she
has
committed
something
wrong
yet
yes
something
very
wrong
interrupted
miss
dundas
reddening
at
this
rebuke
both
lascelles
and
lord
berington
there
do
bring
in
my
name
i
pray
miss
dundas
cried
the
viscount
who
was
looking
over
an
old
edition
of
massinger
plays
you
know
i
hate
being
squeezed
into
squabbles
miss
dundas
dropped
the
corners
of
her
mouth
in
contempt
and
went
on
well
then
lascelles
and
miss
poyntz
here
have
both
at
different
times
been
present
when
phemy
has
conducted
herself
in
a
very
ridiculous
way
towards
a
young
man
lady
tinemouth
sent
here
to
teach
us
german
can
you
believe
it
possible
that
a
girl
of
her
fashion
could
behave
in
this
style
without
having
first
imbibed
some
very
dangerous
notions
i
am
sure
i
am
right
for
she
could
not
be
more
civil
to
him
if
he
were
a
gentleman
miss
dundas
supposed
she
had
now
set
the
affair
beyond
controversy
and
stopped
with
an
air
of
triumph
miss
beaufort
perceived
that
her
answer
was
expected
i
really
can
not
discover
anything
in
the
matter
so
very
reprehensible
replied
she
perhaps
the
person
you
speak
of
may
have
the
qualifications
of
a
gentleman
he
may
be
above
his
situation
ah
above
it
sure
enough
cried
lascelles
laughing
boisterously
at
his
own
folly
he
is
tall
enough
to
be
above
everything
even
good
manners
for
notwithstanding
his
plebeian
calling
i
find
he
does
know
how
to
keep
his
distance
i
am
sorry
for
that
lascelles
cried
berrington
measuring
the
puppy
with
his
eye
for
these
magog
men
are
terrible
objects
to
us
of
meaner
dimensions
substitute
shines
brightly
as
a
king
until
a
king
be
by
why
my
lord
you
do
not
mean
to
compare
me
with
such
a
low
fellow
as
this
i
do
understand
lord
berrington
bless
me
gentlemen
cried
miss
dundas
frightened
at
the
angry
looks
of
the
little
honorable
why
my
lord
i
thought
you
hated
squabbles
so
i
do
miss
dundas
replied
he
laying
down
his
book
and
coming
forward
and
upon
my
honor
lascelles
added
he
smiling
and
turning
towards
the
coxcomb
who
stood
nidging
his
head
with
anger
by
miss
beaufort
chair
upon
my
honor
lascelles
i
did
not
mean
to
draw
any
parallel
between
your
person
and
talents
and
those
of
this
mr
i
forget
his
name
for
truly
i
never
saw
him
in
my
life
but
i
dare
swear
no
comparison
can
exist
between
you
lascelles
took
the
surface
of
this
speech
and
bowed
whilst
his
lordship
turning
to
miss
beaufort
began
to
compliment
himself
on
possessing
so
fair
an
ally
in
defence
of
an
absent
person
i
never
have
seen
him
replied
she
and
what
is
more
i
never
heard
of
him
till
on
entering
the
room
lascelles
arrested
me
for
my
opinion
about
him
i
only
arrived
from
the
country
last
night
and
can
have
no
guess
at
the
real
grounds
of
this
bustle
of
miss
dundas
regarding
a
man
she
styles
despicable
if
he
be
so
why
retain
him
in
her
service
and
what
is
more
absurd
why
make
a
person
in
that
subordinate
situation
the
subject
of
debate
amongst
her
friends
you
are
right
miss
beaufort
returned
lord
berrington
but
the
eloquent
miss
dundas
is
so
condescending
to
her
friends
she
lets
no
opportunity
slip
of
displaying
her
sceptre
both
over
the
republic
of
words
and
the
empire
of
her
mother
family
are
not
you
severe
now
lord
berrington
i
thought
you
generous
to
the
poor
tutor
no
i
hope
i
am
just
on
both
subjects
i
know
the
lady
and
it
is
true
that
i
have
seen
nothing
of
the
tutor
but
it
is
natural
to
wield
the
sword
in
favor
of
the
defenceless
and
i
always
consider
the
absent
in
that
light
whilst
these
two
conversed
at
one
end
of
the
room
the
other
group
were
arraigning
the
presumption
of
the
vulgar
and
the
folly
of
those
who
gave
it
encouragement
at
a
fresh
burst
of
laughter
from
miss
dundas
miss
beaufort
mechanically
turned
her
head
her
eye
was
arrested
by
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
in
black
who
was
standing
a
few
paces
within
the
door
he
was
regarding
the
party
before
him
with
that
lofty
tranquillity
which
is
inseparable
from
high
rank
when
accompanied
by
a
consciousness
of
as
high
inward
qualities
his
figure
his
face
and
his
air
contained
that
pure
simplicity
of
contour
which
portrays
all
the
graces
of
youth
with
the
dignity
of
manhood
miss
beaufort
in
a
moment
perceived
that
he
was
unobserved
rising
from
her
seat
she
said
miss
dundas
here
is
a
gentleman
miss
dundas
looked
round
carelessly
you
may
sit
down
mr
constantine
is
it
possible
thought
miss
beaufort
as
he
approached
and
the
ingenuous
expression
of
his
fine
countenance
was
directed
towards
her
can
this
noble
creature
have
been
the
subject
of
such
impertinence
i
commend
little
phemy
taste
whispered
lord
berrington
leaving
his
seat
ha
miss
beaufort
a
young
apollo
and
not
in
disguise
replied
she
in
the
same
manner
just
as
thaddeus
had
bowed
to
her
and
with
veiled
lids
was
taking
up
a
book
from
the
table
not
to
read
but
literally
to
have
an
object
to
look
on
which
could
not
insult
him
what
did
miss
dundas
say
was
his
name
whispered
the
viscount
constantine
i
think
constantine
said
the
benevolent
berrington
will
you
accept
this
chair
thaddeus
declined
it
but
the
viscount
read
in
the
proud
humility
of
his
bow
that
he
had
not
always
waited
a
dependent
on
the
nods
of
insolent
men
and
ladies
of
fashion
and
with
a
compulsion
he
added
pray
oblige
me
for
by
that
means
i
shall
have
an
excuse
to
squeeze
into
the
which
is
so
as
to
bear
the
weight
of
beaufort
though
miss
beaufort
was
almost
a
stranger
to
his
lordship
having
seen
him
only
once
before
with
her
cousin
in
leicestershire
she
smiled
at
this
unexpected
gallantry
and
in
consideration
of
the
motive
made
room
for
him
on
the
sofa
offence
was
not
swifter
than
kindness
in
its
passage
to
the
heart
of
thaddeus
who
whilst
he
received
the
viscount
chair
raised
his
face
towards
him
with
a
look
beaming
such
graciousness
and
obligation
that
miss
beaufort
turned
with
a
renewed
glance
of
contempt
on
the
party
the
next
instant
they
left
the
study
the
instant
miss
dundas
closed
the
door
after
her
lord
berrington
exclaimed
upon
my
honor
constantine
i
have
a
good
mind
to
put
that
terrible
pupil
of
yours
into
my
next
comedy
do
you
think
she
would
beat
katharine
and
petruchio
all
to
nothing
i
declare
i
will
have
her
in
i
hope
asked
miss
beaufort
with
a
playful
smile
lord
berrington
answered
with
a
gay
sally
from
shakspeare
the
count
remained
silent
during
these
remarks
though
he
fully
appreciated
the
first
civil
treatment
which
had
greeted
him
since
his
admission
within
the
doors
of
lady
dundas
miss
euphemia
attentions
owned
any
other
source
than
benevolence
miss
beaufort
wished
to
relieve
his
embarrassment
by
addressing
him
but
the
more
she
thought
the
less
she
knew
what
to
say
and
she
had
just
abandoned
it
as
a
vain
attempt
when
euphemia
entered
the
room
alone
she
curtseyed
to
thaddeus
and
took
her
place
at
the
table
lord
berrington
rose
i
must
say
miss
euphemia
i
will
not
disturb
your
studies
farewell
miss
beaufort
added
he
addressing
her
and
bending
his
lips
to
her
hand
adieu
i
shall
look
in
upon
you
morning
mr
constantine
thaddeus
bowed
to
him
and
the
viscount
disappeared
i
am
surprised
miss
beaufort
observed
euphemia
pettishly
her
temper
not
having
subsided
since
her
sister
lecture
how
you
can
endure
that
coxcomb
pardon
me
euphemia
replied
she
though
i
did
not
exactly
expect
the
ceremony
his
lordship
adopts
in
taking
leave
yet
i
think
there
is
a
generosity
in
his
sentiments
which
deserves
a
better
title
i
know
nothing
about
his
sentiments
for
i
always
run
away
from
his
conversation
a
better
title
i
declare
you
make
me
laugh
did
you
ever
see
such
fantastical
dressing
i
vow
i
never
meet
him
without
thinking
of
jemmy
jessamy
and
the
rest
of
the
gossamer
beaux
who
squired
our
grandmothers
my
acquaintance
with
lord
berrington
is
trifling
returned
miss
beaufort
withdrawing
her
eyes
from
the
pensive
features
of
the
count
who
was
sorting
the
lessons
yet
i
am
so
far
prepossessed
in
his
favor
that
i
see
little
in
his
appearance
to
reprehend
however
i
will
not
contest
that
point
as
perhaps
the
philanthropy
i
this
morning
discovered
in
his
heart
the
honest
warmth
with
which
he
defended
an
absent
character
after
you
left
the
room
might
render
his
person
as
charming
in
my
eyes
as
i
certainly
found
his
mind
thaddeus
had
not
for
a
long
time
heard
such
sentiments
out
of
lady
tinemouth
circle
and
he
now
looked
up
to
take
a
distinct
view
of
the
speaker
in
consequence
of
the
established
mode
that
the
presiding
lady
of
the
house
is
to
give
the
tone
to
her
guests
many
were
the
visitors
of
miss
dundas
whose
faces
thaddeus
was
as
ignorant
of
when
they
went
out
of
the
library
as
when
they
came
in
they
took
little
notice
of
him
and
he
regarding
them
much
less
pursued
his
occupation
without
evincing
a
greater
consciousness
of
their
presence
than
what
mere
ceremony
demanded
accordingly
when
in
compliance
with
lord
berrington
politeness
he
received
his
chair
and
saw
him
remove
to
a
sofa
beside
a
very
beautiful
woman
in
the
bloom
of
youth
thaddeus
supposed
her
manner
might
resemble
the
rest
of
miss
dundas
friends
and
never
directed
his
glance
a
second
time
to
her
figure
but
when
he
heard
her
in
a
voice
that
was
melody
itself
defend
his
lordship
character
on
principles
which
bore
the
most
honorable
testimony
to
her
own
his
eyes
were
riveted
on
her
face
though
a
large
turkish
shawl
involved
her
fine
person
a
modest
grace
was
observable
in
its
every
turn
her
exquisitely
moulded
arm
rather
veiled
than
concealed
by
the
muslin
sleeve
that
covered
it
was
extended
in
the
gentle
energy
of
her
vindication
her
lucid
eyes
shone
with
a
sincere
benevolence
and
her
lips
seemed
to
breathe
balm
while
she
spoke
his
soul
startled
within
itself
as
if
by
some
strange
recognition
that
agitated
him
and
drew
him
inexplicably
towards
its
object
it
was
not
the
beauty
he
beheld
nor
the
words
she
uttered
but
he
did
not
withdraw
his
fixed
gaze
until
it
encountered
an
accidental
turn
of
her
eyes
which
instantly
retreated
with
a
deep
blush
mantling
her
face
and
neck
she
had
never
met
such
a
look
before
except
in
an
occasional
penetrating
glance
from
an
only
cousin
who
had
long
watched
the
movements
of
her
heart
with
a
brother
care
but
little
did
thaddeus
think
at
that
time
who
she
was
and
how
nearly
connected
with
that
friend
whose
neglect
has
been
a
venomed
shaft
unto
his
soul
mary
beaufort
was
the
orphan
heiress
of
admiral
beaufort
one
of
the
most
distinguished
officers
in
the
british
navy
he
was
the
only
brother
of
the
now
lamented
lady
somerset
the
beloved
mother
of
pembroke
somerset
so
often
the
eloquent
subject
of
his
discourse
in
the
sympathizing
ear
of
thaddeus
sobieski
the
admiral
and
his
wife
a
person
also
of
high
quality
died
within
a
few
months
after
the
birth
of
their
only
child
a
daughter
having
bequeathed
her
to
the
care
of
her
paternal
aunt
and
to
the
sole
guardianship
of
that
exemplary
lady
husband
sir
robert
somerset
baronet
and
for
the
county
when
lady
somerset
death
spread
mourning
throughout
his
till
then
happy
home
which
unforeseen
event
occurred
hardly
a
week
before
her
devoted
son
returned
from
the
shores
of
the
baltic
a
double
portion
of
sir
robert
tenderness
fell
upon
her
cherished
niece
in
her
society
alone
he
found
any
consolation
for
his
loss
and
soon
after
pembroke
arrival
his
widowed
father
relinquishing
the
splendid
scenes
of
his
former
life
in
london
retired
into
the
country
sometimes
residing
at
one
family
seat
sometimes
at
another
hoping
by
change
of
place
to
obtain
some
alleviating
diversion
from
his
ever
thoughts
sir
robert
somerset
from
the
time
of
his
marriage
with
the
accomplished
sister
of
admiral
beaufort
to
the
hour
in
which
he
followed
her
to
the
grave
was
regarded
as
the
most
admired
man
in
every
circle
and
yet
more
publicly
respected
as
being
the
magnificent
host
and
most
munificent
patron
of
talent
particularly
of
british
growth
in
the
whole
land
besides
by
his
own
genius
as
a
statesman
he
often
stood
a
tower
of
strength
in
the
senate
of
his
country
and
his
general
probity
was
of
such
a
stamp
that
his
private
friends
were
all
solicitous
to
acquire
the
protection
of
his
name
over
any
important
trusted
interests
for
their
families
for
instance
the
excellent
lord
avon
consigned
his
only
child
to
his
guardianship
and
his
wealthy
neighbor
sir
hector
dundas
made
him
sole
trusted
over
the
immense
fortunes
of
his
daughters
this
latter
circumstance
explains
the
intimacy
between
two
families
the
female
parts
of
which
might
otherwise
have
probably
seldom
met
on
sir
robert
somerset
last
transient
visit
to
london
which
had
been
only
on
a
call
of
business
on
account
of
his
minor
charge
lord
avon
lady
dundas
became
so
urgent
in
requesting
him
to
permit
miss
beaufort
to
pass
the
ensuing
season
with
her
in
town
that
he
could
not
without
rudeness
refuse
in
compliance
with
this
arrangement
the
gentle
mary
accompanied
by
miss
dorothy
somerset
a
maiden
sister
of
the
baronet
quitted
deerhurst
to
settle
themselves
with
her
importunate
ladyship
in
harley
street
for
the
remainder
of
the
winter
at
least
the
winter
of
fashion
which
by
a
strange
effect
of
her
magic
wand
in
defiance
of
grassy
meadows
leafy
trees
and
flowers
extends
its
nominal
sceptre
over
the
vernal
months
of
april
may
and
even
the
rich
treasures
of
resplendent
june
the
summer
part
of
this
winter
miss
beaufort
reluctantly
consented
should
be
sacrificed
to
ceremony
in
the
dust
and
heat
of
a
great
city
and
if
the
melancholy
which
daily
increased
upon
sir
robert
since
the
death
of
his
wife
had
not
rendered
her
averse
to
oppose
his
wishes
she
certainly
would
have
made
objections
to
the
visit
during
the
journey
she
could
not
refrain
from
drawing
a
comparison
to
miss
dorothy
between
the
dissipated
insipidity
of
lady
way
of
life
and
the
rationality
as
well
as
splendor
of
her
late
lamented
aunt
lady
somerset
monthly
assemblies
were
not
the
most
elegant
and
brilliant
parties
in
town
but
her
weekly
surpassed
everything
of
the
kind
in
the
kingdom
on
these
nights
her
ladyship
rooms
used
to
be
filled
with
the
most
eminent
characters
which
england
could
produce
there
the
young
mary
beaufort
listened
to
pious
divines
of
every
christian
persuasion
there
she
gathered
wisdom
from
real
philosophers
and
in
the
society
of
our
best
living
poets
amongst
whom
were
those
leaders
of
our
classic
song
rogers
and
william
southey
and
the
amiable
jerningham
cherished
an
enthusiasm
for
all
that
is
great
and
good
on
these
evenings
sir
robert
somerset
house
reminded
the
visitor
of
what
he
had
read
or
imagined
of
the
school
of
athens
he
beheld
not
only
sages
soldiers
statesmen
and
poets
but
intelligent
and
amiable
women
and
in
this
rare
assembly
did
the
beautiful
mary
imbibe
that
steady
reverence
for
virtue
and
talent
which
no
intermixture
with
the
ephemera
of
the
clay
could
ever
after
either
displace
or
impair
notwithstanding
this
rare
freedom
from
the
chains
with
which
her
merely
fashionable
friends
would
have
shackled
her
mind
miss
beaufort
possessed
too
much
judgment
and
delicacy
to
flash
her
liberty
in
their
eyes
enjoying
her
independence
with
meekness
she
held
it
more
secure
mary
was
no
declaimer
not
even
in
the
cause
of
oppressed
goodness
or
injured
genius
aware
that
direct
opposition
often
incenses
malice
she
directed
the
shaft
from
its
aim
if
it
were
in
her
power
and
when
the
attempt
failed
strove
by
respect
or
sympathy
to
heal
the
wound
she
could
not
avert
thus
whatever
she
said
or
did
bore
the
stamp
of
her
soul
whose
leading
attribute
was
modesty
by
having
learned
much
and
thought
more
she
proved
in
her
conduct
that
reflection
is
the
alchemy
which
turns
knowledge
into
wisdom
never
did
she
feel
so
much
regret
at
the
shrinking
of
her
powers
from
coming
forth
by
some
word
or
deed
in
aid
of
offended
worth
as
when
she
beheld
the
foreign
stranger
so
noble
in
aspect
standing
under
the
overbearing
insolence
of
miss
dundas
parasites
but
she
perceived
that
his
dignified
composure
rebounded
their
darts
upon
his
insulters
and
respect
took
the
place
of
pity
the
situation
was
new
to
her
and
when
she
dropped
her
confused
eyes
beneath
his
unexpected
gaze
she
marvelled
within
herself
at
the
ease
with
which
she
had
just
taken
up
the
cause
of
lord
berrington
and
the
difficulty
she
had
found
to
summon
one
word
as
a
repellant
to
the
unmerited
attack
on
the
man
before
her
euphemia
cared
nothing
about
lord
berrington
to
her
his
faults
or
his
virtues
were
alike
indifferent
and
forgetting
that
civility
demanded
some
reply
to
miss
beaufort
last
observation
or
rather
taking
advantage
of
the
tolerated
privilege
usurped
by
many
people
of
being
when
and
how
they
pleased
she
returned
to
thaddeus
and
said
with
a
forced
smile
constantine
i
do
like
your
opinion
upon
the
ode
i
showed
to
you
i
think
it
a
very
absurd
opinion
or
perhaps
you
did
not
understand
me
rightly
miss
beaufort
took
up
a
book
that
her
unoccupied
attention
might
not
disturb
their
studies
euphemia
resumed
with
a
more
natural
dimple
and
touching
his
glove
with
the
rosy
points
of
her
fingers
said
you
are
stupid
at
translation
thaddeus
colored
and
sat
uneasily
he
knew
not
how
to
evade
this
direct
though
covert
attack
i
am
a
bad
poet
madam
indeed
it
would
be
dangerous
even
for
a
good
one
to
attempt
the
same
path
with
sappho
and
phillips
euphemia
now
blushed
as
deeply
as
the
count
but
from
another
motive
opening
her
grammar
she
whispered
you
are
either
a
very
dull
or
a
very
modest
man
and
sighing
began
to
repeat
her
lesson
while
he
bent
his
head
over
the
sheet
he
was
correcting
she
suddenly
exclaimed
bless
me
constantine
what
have
you
been
doing
i
hope
you
do
read
in
bed
the
top
of
your
hair
is
burnt
to
a
cinder
why
you
look
much
more
like
one
who
has
been
in
a
fire
than
miss
beaufort
does
thaddeus
put
his
hand
to
his
head
i
thought
i
had
brushed
away
all
marks
of
a
fire
in
which
i
really
was
last
night
a
fire
interrupted
miss
beaufort
closing
her
book
was
it
near
tottenham
court
road
it
was
madam
answered
he
in
a
tone
almost
as
surprised
as
her
own
good
gracious
cried
euphemia
exerting
her
little
voice
that
she
might
be
heard
before
miss
beaufort
could
have
time
to
reply
then
i
vow
you
are
the
gentleman
who
miss
beaufort
said
ran
into
the
burning
house
and
covered
with
flames
saved
two
children
from
perishing
and
i
am
so
happy
as
to
meet
one
of
the
ladies
replied
he
turning
with
an
animated
air
to
miss
beaufort
in
you
madam
who
so
humanely
assisted
the
poor
sufferers
and
received
the
child
from
my
arms
it
was
indeed
myself
constantine
returned
she
a
tear
swimming
over
her
eye
which
in
a
moment
gave
the
cue
to
the
tender
euphemia
she
drew
out
her
handkerchief
and
whilst
her
pretty
cheeks
overflowed
and
her
sweet
voice
was
rendered
sweeter
by
an
emotion
raised
by
ten
thousand
delightful
fancies
she
took
hold
of
miss
beaufort
hand
oh
my
lovely
friend
wonder
not
that
i
esteem
this
brave
constantine
far
beyond
his
present
station
thaddeus
drew
back
miss
beaufort
looked
amazed
but
euphemia
had
mounted
her
romantic
pegasus
and
the
scene
was
too
sentimental
to
close
come
here
constantine
cried
she
extending
her
other
hand
to
his
wondering
where
this
folly
would
terminate
he
gave
it
to
her
when
instantly
joining
it
with
that
of
miss
beaufort
she
pressed
them
together
and
said
sweet
mary
heroic
constantine
i
thus
elect
you
the
two
dearest
friends
of
my
heart
so
charmingly
associated
in
the
delightful
task
of
compassion
you
shall
ever
be
commingled
in
my
faithful
bosom
then
putting
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
she
walked
out
of
the
room
leaving
miss
beaufort
and
the
count
confused
and
confounded
by
the
side
of
each
other
miss
beaufort
suspecting
that
some
extravagant
fancy
had
taken
possession
of
the
susceptible
euphemia
towards
her
young
tutor
declined
speaking
first
thaddeus
fixing
his
gaze
on
her
downcast
and
revolving
countenance
perceived
nothing
like
offended
pride
at
his
undesigned
presumption
he
saw
that
she
was
only
embarrassed
and
after
a
minute
hesitation
broke
the
silence
i
hope
that
miss
beaufort
is
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
romance
of
miss
euphemia
character
to
pardon
the
action
unintentional
on
my
part
of
having
touched
her
hand
i
declare
i
had
no
expectation
of
miss
euphemia
design
do
not
make
any
apology
to
me
constantine
returned
she
resuming
her
seat
to
be
sure
i
was
a
little
electrified
by
the
strange
situation
in
which
her
vivid
feelings
have
just
made
us
actors
but
i
shall
not
forego
my
claim
on
what
she
promised
your
acquaintance
thaddeus
expressed
his
high
sense
of
her
condescension
i
am
not
fond
of
fine
terms
continued
she
smiling
but
i
know
that
time
and
merit
must
purchase
esteem
i
can
engage
for
the
first
as
i
am
to
remain
in
town
at
least
three
months
but
for
the
last
i
fear
i
shall
never
have
the
opportunity
of
giving
such
an
earnest
of
my
desert
as
you
did
last
night
of
yours
footsteps
sounded
on
the
stairs
thaddeus
took
up
his
hat
and
bowing
replied
to
her
compliment
with
such
a
modest
yet
noble
grace
that
she
gazed
after
him
with
wonder
and
concern
before
he
closed
the
door
he
again
bowed
pleased
with
the
transient
look
of
a
soft
pleasure
which
beamed
from
his
eyes
through
whose
ingenuous
mirrors
every
thought
of
his
soul
might
be
read
she
smiled
a
second
adieu
and
as
he
disappeared
left
the
room
by
another
passage
chapter
xxvii
such
things
were
when
the
count
appeared
the
succeeding
day
in
harley
street
miss
beaufort
introduced
him
to
miss
dorothy
somerset
as
the
gentleman
who
had
so
gallantly
preserved
the
lives
of
the
children
at
the
hazard
of
his
own
notwithstanding
the
lofty
tossings
of
miss
dundas
head
the
good
old
maid
paid
him
several
encomiums
on
his
intrepidity
and
telling
him
that
the
sufferers
were
the
wife
and
family
of
a
poor
tradesman
who
was
then
absent
in
the
country
she
added
but
we
saw
them
comfortably
lodged
before
we
left
them
and
all
the
time
we
stayed
i
could
not
help
congratulating
myself
on
the
easy
compliance
of
mary
with
my
whims
i
dislike
sleeping
at
an
inn
and
to
prevent
it
then
i
had
prevailed
on
miss
beaufort
to
pursue
our
road
to
town
even
through
the
night
it
was
lucky
it
happened
so
for
i
am
certain
mary
will
not
allow
these
poor
creatures
a
long
lament
over
the
wreck
of
their
little
property
how
charmingly
charitable
my
lovely
friend
cried
euphemia
let
us
make
a
collection
for
this
unfortunate
woman
and
her
babes
pray
as
a
small
tribute
take
that
from
me
she
put
five
guineas
into
the
hand
of
the
glowing
mary
the
ineffable
grace
with
which
the
confused
miss
beaufort
laid
the
money
on
her
aunt
knee
did
not
escape
the
observance
of
thaddeus
neither
did
the
unintended
approbation
of
his
eye
pass
unnoticed
by
its
amiable
object
when
lady
tinemouth
was
informed
that
evening
by
the
count
of
the
addition
to
the
harley
street
party
she
was
delighted
at
the
news
saying
she
had
been
well
acquainted
with
miss
dorothy
and
her
niece
during
the
lifetime
of
lady
somerset
and
would
take
an
early
day
to
call
upon
them
during
this
part
of
her
ladyship
discourse
an
additional
word
or
two
had
unfolded
to
her
auditor
the
family
connection
that
had
subsisted
between
the
lady
she
regretted
and
his
estranged
friend
and
when
the
countess
paused
thaddeus
struck
with
a
forgiving
pity
at
this
intelligence
was
on
the
point
of
expressing
his
concern
that
pembroke
somerset
had
lost
so
a
mother
but
recollecting
that
lady
tinemouth
was
ignorant
of
their
ever
having
known
each
other
he
allowed
her
to
proceed
without
a
remark
i
never
have
been
in
company
with
sir
robert
son
continued
the
countess
it
was
during
his
absence
on
the
continent
that
i
was
introduced
to
lady
somerset
she
was
a
woman
who
possessed
the
rare
talent
of
conforming
herself
to
all
descriptions
of
people
and
whilst
the
complacency
of
her
attentions
surpassed
the
most
refined
flattery
she
commanded
the
highest
veneration
for
herself
hence
you
may
imagine
my
satisfaction
in
an
acquaintance
which
it
is
probable
would
never
have
been
mine
had
i
been
the
happy
countess
of
tinemouth
instead
of
a
deserted
wife
though
the
somersets
are
related
to
my
lord
they
had
long
treated
him
as
a
stranger
and
doubly
disgusted
at
his
late
behavior
they
commenced
a
friendship
with
me
i
believe
to
demonstrate
more
fully
their
detestation
of
him
indeed
my
husband
is
a
creature
of
inconsistency
no
man
possessed
more
power
to
attract
friends
than
lord
tinemouth
and
no
man
had
less
power
to
retain
them
as
fast
as
he
made
one
he
offended
the
other
and
has
at
last
deprived
himself
of
every
individual
out
of
his
own
house
who
would
not
regard
his
death
as
a
fortunate
circumstance
but
lady
somerset
cried
thaddeus
impatient
to
change
a
subject
every
word
of
which
was
a
dagger
to
his
heart
i
mean
miss
dorothy
somerset
miss
beaufort
yes
returned
her
ladyship
i
see
kind
constantine
your
friendly
solicitude
to
disengage
me
from
retrospections
so
painful
well
then
i
knew
and
very
much
esteemed
the
two
ladies
you
mention
but
after
the
death
of
lady
somerset
their
almost
constant
residence
in
the
country
has
greatly
prevented
a
renewal
of
this
pleasure
however
as
they
are
now
in
town
i
will
thank
you
to
acquaint
them
with
my
intention
to
call
upon
them
in
harley
street
i
remember
always
thinking
miss
beaufort
a
very
charming
girl
thaddeus
thought
her
more
he
saw
that
she
was
beautiful
he
had
witnessed
instances
of
her
goodness
and
the
recollection
filled
his
mind
with
a
complacency
the
more
tender
since
it
had
so
long
been
a
stranger
to
his
bosom
and
again
he
felt
the
strange
emotion
which
had
passed
over
his
heart
at
their
first
meeting
but
further
observations
were
prevented
by
the
entrance
of
miss
egerton
and
lady
sara
ross
i
am
glad
to
see
you
constantine
cried
the
lively
sophia
shaking
hands
with
him
you
are
the
very
person
i
have
been
plotting
against
lady
tinemouth
was
uneasy
at
the
care
with
which
lady
sara
averted
her
face
well
knowing
that
it
was
to
conceal
the
powerful
agitation
of
her
features
which
always
took
place
at
the
sight
of
thaddeus
what
is
your
plot
miss
egerton
inquired
he
i
shall
consider
myself
honored
by
your
commands
and
do
not
require
a
conspiracy
to
entrap
my
obedience
that
a
good
soul
then
i
have
only
to
apply
to
you
lady
tinemouth
your
ladyship
must
know
cried
she
that
as
lady
sara
and
i
were
a
moment
ago
driving
up
the
haymarket
i
nodded
to
coleman
who
was
coming
out
of
the
playhouse
he
stopped
i
pulled
the
and
we
had
a
great
deal
of
confab
out
of
the
window
he
tells
me
a
new
farce
is
to
come
out
this
day
week
and
he
hoped
i
would
be
there
said
i
can
not
for
i
am
on
a
visit
with
that
precise
body
the
countess
of
tinemouth
who
would
not
to
save
you
and
all
your
generation
come
into
such
a
mob
ladyship
shall
have
my
box
cried
he
i
would
not
for
the
world
lose
the
honor
of
your
opinion
on
the
merits
of
my
farce
be
sure
not
cries
i
so
i
accepted
his
box
and
drove
off
devising
with
lady
sara
how
to
get
your
ladyship
as
our
chaperon
and
constantine
to
be
our
beau
he
has
just
promised
so
dear
lady
tinemouth
do
be
inflexible
thaddeus
was
confounded
at
the
dilemma
into
which
his
ready
acquiescence
had
involved
his
prudence
the
countess
shook
her
head
now
i
declare
lady
tinemouth
exclaimed
miss
egerton
this
is
an
absolute
stingy
fit
you
are
afraid
of
your
purse
you
know
this
private
box
precludes
all
awkward
meetings
and
you
can
have
no
excuse
but
it
can
not
preclude
all
awkward
sights
answered
her
ladyship
you
know
sophia
i
never
go
into
public
for
fear
of
being
met
by
the
angry
looks
of
my
lord
or
my
son
disagreeable
people
cried
miss
egerton
pettishly
i
wish
some
friendly
whirlwind
would
take
your
lord
and
son
out
of
the
world
together
sophia
retorted
her
ladyship
with
a
grave
air
rebuke
me
lady
tinemouth
if
you
like
i
confess
i
am
no
serena
and
these
trials
of
temper
do
agree
with
my
constitution
there
cried
she
throwing
a
silver
medal
on
the
table
and
laughing
in
spite
of
herself
there
is
our
passport
but
i
will
send
it
back
and
so
break
poor
coleman
heart
fie
sophia
answered
her
ladyship
patting
her
cheeks
would
you
owe
to
your
petulance
what
was
denied
to
your
good
humor
then
your
ladyship
will
go
exclaimed
she
exultingly
you
have
yielded
these
sullens
were
a
part
of
my
stratagem
and
i
wo
let
you
secede
lady
tinemouth
thought
this
would
be
a
fair
opportunity
to
show
one
of
the
theatres
to
her
young
friend
without
involving
him
in
expense
or
obligation
and
accordingly
she
gave
her
consent
do
you
intend
to
favor
us
with
your
company
lady
sara
asked
the
countess
with
a
hope
that
she
might
refuse
lady
sara
who
had
been
standing
silently
at
the
window
rather
proudly
answered
yes
madam
if
you
will
honor
me
with
your
protection
lady
tinemouth
was
the
only
one
present
who
understood
the
resentment
which
these
words
conveyed
and
almost
believing
that
she
had
gone
too
far
by
implying
suspicion
she
approached
her
with
a
pleading
anxiety
of
countenance
then
lady
sara
perhaps
you
will
dine
with
me
i
mean
to
call
on
miss
dorothy
somerset
and
would
invite
her
to
be
of
the
party
lady
sara
curtseyed
her
acceptance
of
the
invitation
and
smiling
appeared
to
think
no
more
of
the
matter
but
she
neither
forgot
it
nor
found
herself
able
to
forgive
lady
tinemouth
for
having
betrayed
her
into
a
confidence
which
her
own
turbulent
passions
had
made
but
too
easy
she
had
listened
unwillingly
to
the
reasonable
declaration
of
the
countess
that
her
only
way
to
retreat
from
an
error
which
threatened
criminality
was
to
avoid
the
object
when
a
married
woman
observed
her
ladyship
in
that
confidential
conference
is
so
unhappy
as
to
love
any
man
besides
her
husband
her
only
safety
rests
in
the
resolution
to
quit
his
society
and
to
banish
his
image
whenever
it
obtrudes
lady
sara
believed
herself
incapable
of
this
exertion
and
hated
the
woman
who
thought
it
necessary
by
letter
and
conversation
lady
tinemouth
tried
to
display
in
every
possible
light
the
enormity
of
giving
encouragement
to
such
an
attachment
and
ended
with
the
unanswerable
climax
the
consideration
of
her
duty
to
heaven
of
this
argument
lady
sara
knew
little
she
never
reflected
on
the
true
nature
of
religion
though
she
sometimes
went
to
church
repeated
the
prayers
without
being
conscious
of
their
spirit
and
when
the
coughing
sneezing
and
blowing
of
noses
which
commonly
accompany
the
text
subsided
she
generally
called
up
the
remembrance
of
the
last
ball
or
an
anticipation
of
the
next
assembly
to
amuse
herself
until
the
prosing
business
was
over
from
church
she
drove
to
the
park
where
bowling
round
the
ring
or
sauntering
in
the
gardens
she
soon
forgot
that
there
existed
in
the
universe
a
power
of
higher
consequence
to
please
than
her
own
vanity
and
the
admiration
of
the
spectators
lady
sara
would
have
shuddered
at
hearing
any
one
declare
himself
a
deist
much
more
an
atheist
but
for
any
influence
which
her
nominal
belief
held
over
her
desires
she
might
as
well
have
been
either
she
never
committed
an
action
deserving
the
name
of
premeditated
injury
nor
went
far
out
of
her
way
to
do
her
best
friend
a
service
not
because
she
wanted
inclination
but
she
ceased
to
remember
both
the
petitioner
and
his
petition
before
he
had
been
five
minutes
from
her
sight
she
had
read
as
much
as
most
fine
ladies
have
read
a
few
histories
a
few
volumes
of
essays
a
few
novels
and
now
and
then
a
little
poetry
comprised
the
whole
range
of
her
studies
these
with
morning
calls
and
evening
assemblies
occupied
her
whole
day
such
had
been
the
routine
of
her
life
until
she
met
the
once
young
star
of
poland
thaddeus
sobieski
in
an
unknown
exile
an
almost
nameless
guest
at
lady
tinemouth
which
event
caused
a
total
revolution
in
her
mind
and
conduct
the
strength
of
lady
sara
understanding
might
have
credited
a
better
education
but
her
passions
bearing
an
equal
power
with
this
mental
vigor
and
having
taken
a
wrong
direction
she
neither
acknowledged
the
will
nor
the
capability
to
give
the
empire
to
her
reason
when
love
really
entered
her
heart
its
first
conquest
was
over
her
universal
vanity
she
surrendered
all
her
admirers
in
the
hope
of
securing
the
admiration
of
thaddeus
its
second
victory
mastered
her
discretion
she
revealed
her
unhappy
affection
to
lady
tinemouth
and
more
than
hinted
it
to
himself
what
had
she
else
to
lose
she
believed
her
honor
to
be
safer
than
her
life
her
was
the
term
she
had
no
conception
or
at
best
a
faint
one
that
a
breach
of
the
marriage
vow
could
be
an
outrage
on
the
laws
of
heaven
the
word
sin
had
been
gradually
ignored
by
the
oligarchy
of
fashion
from
the
hour
in
which
charles
the
second
and
his
profligate
court
trod
down
piety
with
hypocrisy
and
in
this
day
the
new
philosophy
has
accomplished
its
total
outlawry
denouncing
it
as
a
rebel
to
decency
and
the
freedom
of
man
thus
the
christian
religion
being
driven
from
the
haunts
of
the
great
pagan
morality
is
raised
from
that
prostration
where
like
it
fell
at
the
feet
of
the
scriptures
and
is
again
erected
as
the
idol
of
adoration
guilt
against
heaven
fades
before
the
decrees
of
man
his
law
of
ethics
reprobates
crime
but
crime
is
only
a
temporal
transgression
in
opposition
to
the
general
good
it
draws
no
consequent
punishment
heavier
than
the
judgment
of
a
broken
human
law
or
the
resentment
of
the
offended
private
parties
morality
neither
promises
rewards
after
death
nor
denounces
future
chastisement
for
error
the
disciples
of
this
independent
doctrine
hold
forth
instances
of
the
perfectibility
of
human
actions
produced
by
the
unassisted
decisions
of
human
intellect
on
the
limits
of
right
and
wrong
they
admire
virtue
because
it
is
beautiful
they
practice
it
because
it
is
heroic
they
do
not
abstain
from
the
gratification
of
an
intemperate
wish
under
the
belief
that
it
is
sinful
but
in
obedience
to
their
reason
which
rejects
the
commission
of
a
vicious
act
because
it
is
uncomely
in
the
first
case
god
is
their
judge
in
the
latter
themselves
the
comparison
need
only
be
proposed
to
humble
the
pride
that
made
it
necessary
how
do
these
systematizers
refine
and
subtilize
how
do
they
dwell
on
the
principle
of
virtue
and
turn
it
in
every
metaphysical
light
until
their
philosophy
rarifies
it
to
nothing
some
degrade
and
others
abandon
the
only
basis
on
which
an
upright
character
can
stand
with
firmness
the
bulwark
which
revelation
erected
between
the
passions
and
the
soul
is
levelled
first
and
then
that
instinctive
rule
of
right
which
the
modern
casuist
denominates
the
citadel
of
virtue
falls
of
course
by
such
gradations
the
progress
of
depravity
is
accomplished
and
the
general
leaven
having
worked
to
lady
sara
mind
on
such
premises
though
she
might
not
arrange
them
so
distinctly
she
deduced
that
what
is
called
conjugal
right
is
a
mere
establishment
of
man
and
might
be
extended
or
limited
by
him
to
any
length
he
pleased
for
instance
the
turks
were
not
content
with
one
wife
but
appropriated
hundreds
to
one
man
and
because
such
indulgence
was
permitted
by
mohammed
no
other
nation
presumed
to
call
them
culpable
hence
she
thought
that
if
she
could
once
reconcile
herself
to
believe
that
her
own
happiness
was
dearer
to
her
than
the
notice
of
half
a
thousand
people
to
whom
she
was
indifferent
that
only
in
their
opinion
and
the
world
her
flying
to
the
protection
of
thaddeus
would
be
crime
could
she
confidently
think
this
what
should
deter
her
from
instantly
throwing
herself
into
the
arms
of
the
man
she
loved
footnote
such
were
the
moral
tactics
for
human
conduct
at
the
commencement
of
this
century
but
thanks
to
the
patience
of
god
he
has
given
a
better
spirit
to
the
present
age
to
his
philosophy
an
admirable
development
of
the
wisdom
and
beneficence
of
his
works
instead
of
the
former
metaphysical
vanities
and
contradictory
bewilderments
of
opinions
concerning
the
divine
nature
and
the
elements
of
man
which
as
far
as
a
could
go
had
plunged
the
created
world
both
physically
and
morally
into
the
darkness
of
chaos

one
night
as

traversed

what

as

cried

after
a

of
some
minutes
how

what
passes
in

of

oh
i
should
be
the

of
the
happy
fatal
conclusion
of
reflection
it
infected
her
dreaming
and
her

she
regarded
everything
as
an
enemy
that
opposed
her
passion
and
as
the
first
of
these
enemies
she
detested
lady
tinemouth
the
countess
last
admonishing
letter
enraged
her
by
its
arguments
and
throwing
it
into
the
fire
with
execrations
and
tears
she
determined
to
pursue
her
own
will
but
to
affect
being
influenced
by
her
ladyship
counsels
the
count
sobieski
who
surmised
not
the
hundredth
part
of
the
infatuation
of
lady
sara
began
to
hope
that
her
ardent
manner
had
misled
him
or
that
she
had
seen
the
danger
of
such
imprudence
under
these
impressions
the
party
for

was
settled

addition
of

to
the

group
at

imparted
a
less
reluctant
motion
to
the
before
tardy
feet
of
the
count
whenever
he
turned
them
towards
harley
street
miss
dorothy
readily
supposed
him
to
have
been
better
born
than
he
appeared
and
displeased
with
the
treatment
he
had
received
from
miss

and
her

herself
with
the
most
gratifying
politeness
aunt
dorothy
for
that
was
the
title
by
which
every
branch
of
the
baronet
family
addressed
her
was
full
twenty
years
the
senior
of
her
brother
sir
robert
somerset
having
in
her
youth
been
thought
very
like
the
famous
and
lovely
woffington
she
had
been
considered
the
beauty
of
her
time
and
as
such
for
ten
years
continued
the
reigning
belle
nevertheless
she
arrived
at
the
age
of
without
having
been
either
the
object
or
the
subject
of
a
fervent
passion
possessing
a
fine
understanding
a
refined
taste
and
fine
feelings
by
some
chance
she
had
escaped
love
it
can
not
be
denied
that
she
was
much
admired
much
respected
and
much
esteemed
and
that
she
received
two
or
three
splendid
proposals
from
men
of
rank
some
of
those
men
she
admired
some
she
respected
and
some
she
esteemed
but
not
one
did
she
love
and
she
successively
refused
them
all
shortly
after
their
discharge
they
generally
consoled
themselves
by
marrying
other
women
who
perhaps
wanted
both
the
charms
and
the
sense
of
miss
somerset
yet
she
congratulated
them
on
their
choice
and
usually
became
the
warm
friend
of
the
happy
couple
thus
year
passed
over
year
miss
somerset
continued
the
esteemed
of
every
worthy
heart
though
she
could
not
then
kindle
the
embers
of
a
livelier
glow
in
any
one
of
them
and
at
the
epoch
called
a
she
found
herself
an
old
maid
but
possessing
so
much
good
humor
and
affection
towards
the
young
people
about
her
she
did
not
need
any
of
her
own
to
mingle
in
the
circle
this
amiable
old
lady
usually
took
her
knitting
into
the
library
before
the
fair
students
and
whenever
thaddeus
entered
the
room
so
natural
is
it
for
generous
natures
to
sympathize
his
eyes
first
sought
her
venerable
figure
then
glancing
around
to
catch
an
assuring
beam
from
the
lovely
countenance
of
her
niece
he
seated
himself
with
confidence
the
presence
of
these
ladies
operated
as
a
more
than
sufficient
antidote
to
the
disagreeableness
of
his
situation
to
them
he
directed
all
the
attention
that
was
not
required
by
his
occupation
he
heard
them
only
speak
when
a
hundred
others
were
talking
he
saw
them
only
when
a
hundred
others
were
in
company
in
addition
to
this
pleasant
change
miss
euphemia
passion
assumed
a
less
tormenting
form
she
had
been
reading
madame
camilla
and
becoming
enamored
of
the
delicacy
and
pensive
silence
of
the
interesting
heroine
she
determined
on
adopting
the
same
character
and
at
the
same
time
taking
it
into
her
brain
that
constantine
coldness
bore
a
striking
affinity
to
the
caution
of
edgar
mandelbert
she
wiped
the
rouge
from
her
pretty
face
and
prepared
to
let
concealment
like
a
worm
in
the
bud
feed
on
her
damask
cheek
to
afford
decorous
support
to
this
fancy
her
gayest
clothes
were
thrown
aside
to
make
way
for
a
negligence
of
apparel
which
cost
her
two
hours
each
morning
to
compose
her
dimpling
smiles
were
now
quite
banished
she
was
ever
sighing
and
ever
silent
and
ever
lolling
and
leaning
about
reclining
along
sofas
or
in
some
disconsolate
attitude
grouping
herself
with
one
of
the
marble
urns
and
sitting
like
patience
on
a
monument
smiling
at
grief
thaddeus
preferred
this
pathetic
whim
to
her
former
sapphic
follies
it
afforded
him
quiet
and
relieved
him
from
much
embarrassment
every
succeeding
visit
induced
miss
beaufort
to
observe
him
with
a
more
lively
interest
the
nobleness
yet
humility
with
which
he
behaved
towards
herself
and
her
aunt
and
the
manly
serenity
with
which
he
suffered
the
insulting
sarcasms
of
miss
dundas
led
her
not
merely
to
conceive
but
to
entertain
many
doubts
that
his
present
situation
was
that
of
his
birth
the
lady
visitors
who
dropped
in
on
the
sisters
studies
were
not
backward
in
espousing
the
game
of
ridicule
as
it
played
away
a
few
minutes
to
join
in
a
laugh
with
the
witty
diana
these
gracious
beings
thought
their
sex
gave
them
privilege
to
offend
but
it
was
not
always
that
the
gentlemen
durst
venture
beyond
a
shrug
of
the
shoulder
a
drop
of
the
lip
a
wink
of
the
eye
or
a
raising
of
the
brows
mary
observed
with
contempt
that
they
were
prudent
enough
not
to
exercise
even
these
specimens
of
a
mean
hostility
except
when
its
noble
object
had
turned
his
back
and
regarding
him
with
increased
admiration
she
was
indignant
and
then
disdainful
at
the
envy
which
actuated
these
men
to
treat
with
affected
scorn
him
whom
they
secretly
feared
illustration
miss
euphemia
dundas
the
occasional
calls
of
lady
tinemouth
and
miss
egerton
stimulated
the
cabal
against
thaddeus
the
sincere
sentiment
of
equality
with
themselves
which
these
two
ladies
evinced
by
their
behavior
to
him
and
the
same
conduct
being
adopted
by
miss
dorothy
and
her
beautiful
niece
besides
the
evident
partiality
of
euphemia
altogether
inflamed
the
spleen
of
miss
dundas
and
excited
her
to
acts
of
the
most
extravagant
rudeness
the
little
phalanx
at
the
head
of
which
was
the
superb
diana
could
offer
no
real
reason
for
disliking
a
man
who
was
not
only
their
inferior
but
who
had
never
offended
them
even
by
implication
it
was
a
sufficient
apology
to
their
easy
consciences
that
he
gave
himself
such
courtly
airs
as
were
quite
ridiculous
that
his
presumption
was
astonishing
in
short
they
were
all
idle
and
it
was
exceedingly
amusing
to
lounge
a
morning
with
the
rich
dundases
and
hoax
monsieur
had
thaddeus
known
one
fourth
of
the
insolent
derision
with
which
his
misfortunes
were
treated
behind
his
back
perhaps
even
his
necessity
could
not
have
detained
him
in
his
employment
the
brightness
of
a
brave
man
name
makes
shadows
perceptible
which
might
pass
unmarked
over
a
duller
surface
sobieski
delicate
honor
would
have
supposed
itself
sullied
by
enduring
such
contumely
with
toleration
but
as
was
said
before
the
male
adjuncts
of
miss
dundas
had
received
so
opportune
a
warning
from
an
accidental
knitting
of
the
count
brow
they
never
after
could
muster
temerity
to
sport
their
wit
to
his
face
these
circumstances
were
not
lost
upon
mary
she
collected
them
as
part
of
a
treasure
and
turned
them
over
on
her
pillow
with
the
jealous
examination
of
a
miser
like
euphemia
she
supposed
thaddeus
to
be
other
than
he
seemed
yet
her
fancy
did
not
suppose
him
gifted
with
the
blood
of
the
bourbons
she
merely
believed
him
to
be
a
gentleman
and
from
the
maternal
manner
of
lady
tinemouth
towards
him
she
suspected
that
her
ladyship
knew
more
of
his
history
than
she
chose
to
reveal
things
were
in
this
state
when
the
countess
requested
that
miss
dorothy
would
allow
her
niece
to
make
one
in
her
party
to
the
haymarket
theatre
the
good
lady
having
consented
miss
beaufort
received
the
permission
with
pleasure
and
as
she
was
to
sup
in
grosvenor
place
she
ventured
to
hope
that
something
might
fall
from
her
hostess
or
miss
egerton
which
would
throw
a
light
on
the
true
situation
of
constantine
from
infancy
miss
beaufort
had
loved
with
enthusiasm
all
kinds
of
excellence
indeed
she
esteemed
no
person
warmly
whom
she
did
no
think
exalted
by
their
virtues
above
the
common
race
of
mankind
she
sought
for
something
to
respect
in
every
character
and
when
she
found
anything
to
greatly
admire
her
ardent
soul
blazed
and
by
its
own
pure
flame
lit
her
to
a
closer
inspection
of
the
object
about
whom
she
had
become
more
than
usually
interested
in
former
years
lady
somerset
collected
all
the
virtue
and
talent
in
the
country
around
her
table
and
it
was
now
found
that
they
were
not
brought
there
on
a
vain
errand
from
them
miss
beaufort
gathered
her
best
lessons
in
conduct
and
taste
and
from
them
her
earliest
perceptions
of
friendship
mary
was
the
beloved
pupil
and
respected
friend
of
the
brightest
characters
in
england
and
though
some
of
them
were
men
who
had
not
passed
the
age
of
forty
she
never
had
been
in
love
nor
had
she
mistaken
the
nature
of
her
esteem
so
far
as
to
call
it
by
that
name
hence
she
was
neither
afraid
nor
ashamed
to
acknowledge
a
correspondence
she
knew
to
be
her
highest
distinction
but
had
the
frank
and
innocent
mary
exhibited
half
the
like
attentions
which
she
paid
to
these
men
in
one
hour
to
the
common
class
of
young
men
through
the
course
of
a
month
they
would
have
declared
that
the
poor
girl
was
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
them
and
have
pitied
what
they
would
have
justly
denominated
her
folly
foolish
must
that
woman
be
who
would
sacrifice
the
most
precious
gift
in
her
possession
her
heart
to
the
superficial
graces
or
empty
blandishments
of
a
coxcomb
such
a
being
was
not
mary
beaufort
and
on
these
principles
she
contemplated
the
extraordinary
fine
qualities
she
saw
in
the
exiled
thaddeus
with
an
interest
honorable
to
her
penetration
and
her
heart
when
miss
egerton
called
with
lady
sara
ross
to
take
miss
beaufort
to
the
haymarket
mary
was
not
displeased
at
seeing
constantine
step
out
of
the
carnage
to
hand
her
in
during
their
drive
miss
egerton
informed
her
that
lady
tinemouth
had
been
suddenly
seized
with
a
headache
but
that
lady
sara
had
kindly
undertaken
to
be
their
chaperon
and
had
promised
to
return
with
them
to
sup
in
grosvenor
place
lady
sara
had
never
seen
mary
though
she
had
frequently
heard
of
her
beauty
and
vast
fortune
this
last
qualification
her
ladyship
hoped
might
have
given
an
unmerited
to
the
first
therefore
when
she
saw
in
miss
beaufort
the
most
beautiful
creature
she
had
ever
beheld
nothing
could
equal
her
surprise
and
vexation
the
happy
lustre
that
beamed
in
the
fine
eyes
of
mary
shone
like
a
vivifying
influence
around
her
a
bright
glow
animated
her
cheek
whilst
a
pleasure
for
which
she
did
not
seek
to
account
bounded
at
her
heart
and
modulated
every
tone
of
her
voice
to
sweetness
and
enchantment
syren
thought
lady
sara
withdrawing
her
large
dark
eyes
from
her
face
and
turning
them
full
of
dissolving
languor
upon
thaddeus
here
are
all
thy
charms
directed
then
drawing
a
sigh
so
deep
that
it
made
her
neighbor
start
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
her
fan
and
never
looked
up
again
until
they
had
reached
the
playhouse
the
curtain
was
raised
as
the
little
party
seated
themselves
in
the
box
can
anybody
tell
me
what
the
play
is
asked
lady
sara
i
never
thought
of
inquiring
replied
sophia
i
looked
in
the
newspaper
this
morning
said
miss
beaufort
and
i
think
it
is
called
a
translation
from
a
drama
of
kotzebue
a
strange
title
was
the
general
observation
when
suett
who
personated
one
of
the
characters
began
to
speak
their
attention
was
summoned
to
the
stage
on
the
entrance
of
charles
kemble
in
the
character
of
adelbert
the
count
unconsciously
turned
pale
he
perceived
by
the
dress
of
the
actor
that
he
was
to
personate
a
pole
and
alarmed
at
the
probability
of
seeing
something
to
recall
recollections
which
he
had
striven
to
banish
his
agitation
did
not
allow
him
to
hear
anything
that
was
said
for
some
minutes
miss
egerton
was
not
so
tardy
in
the
use
of
her
eyes
and
ears
and
stretching
out
her
hand
to
the
back
of
the
box
where
thaddeus
was
standing
by
lady
sara
chair
she
caught
hold
of
his
sleeve
there
mr
constantine
cried
she
look
at
adelbert
that
is
exactly
the
figure
you
cut
in
your
outlandish
gear
two
months
ago
thaddeus
bowed
with
a
forced
smile
and
glancing
at
the
stage
replied
then
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
regret
having
followed
a
lady
advice
i
think
i
must
have
lost
by
the
change
yes
rejoined
she
you
have
lost
much
fur
and
much
embroidery
but
you
now
look
much
more
like
a
christian
the
substance
of
these
speeches
was
not
lost
on
mary
who
continued
with
redoubling
interest
to
mark
the
changes
his
countenance
underwent
along
with
the
scene
as
she
sat
forward
by
a
slight
turn
of
the
head
she
could
discern
the
smallest
fluctuation
in
his
features
and
they
were
not
a
few
placing
himself
at
the
back
of
lady
sara
chair
he
leaned
over
with
his
soul
set
in
his
eye
watching
every
motion
of
charles
kemble
mary
knew
by
some
accidental
words
from
lady
tinemouth
that
constantine
was
a
polander
and
the
surmise
she
had
entertained
of
his
being
unfortunate
received
full
corroboration
at
the
scene
in
which
adelbert
is
grossly
insulted
by
the
rich
merchant
during
the
whole
of
it
she
scarcely
dared
trust
her
eyes
towards
flushed
and
agitated
face
the
interview
between
adelbert
and
leopold
commenced
when
the
former
was
describing
his
country
miseries
with
his
own
thaddeus
unable
to
bear
it
longer
unobserved
by
any
but
mary
drew
back
into
the
box
in
a
moment
or
two
afterwards
charles
kemble
made
the
following
reply
to
an
observation
of
leopold
that
poverty
is
no
dishonor
certainly
none
to
me
to
poland
to
my
struggling
country
i
sacrificed
my
wealth
as
i
would
have
sacrificed
my
life
if
she
had
required
it
my
country
is
no
more
and
we
are
wanderers
on
a
burdened
earth
finding
no
refuge
but
in
the
hearts
of
the
humane
and
virtuous
the
passion
and
force
of
these
words
could
not
fail
of
reaching
the
ears
of
thaddeus
mary
attention
followed
them
to
their
object
by
the
heaving
of
whose
breast
she
plainly
discovered
the
anguish
of
their
effect
her
heart
beat
with
increased
violence
how
willingly
would
she
have
approached
him
and
said
something
of
sympathy
of
consolation
but
she
durst
not
and
she
turned
away
her
tearful
eye
and
looked
again
towards
the
stage
lady
sara
now
stood
up
and
hanging
over
mary
chair
listened
with
congenial
emotions
to
the
scene
between
adelbert
and
the
innocent
rose
lady
sara
felt
it
all
in
her
own
bosom
and
looking
round
to
catch
what
was
passing
in
the
count
mind
she
beheld
him
leaning
against
the
box
with
his
head
inclined
to
the
curtain
of
the
door
mr
constantine
almost
unconsciously
escaped
her
lips
he
started
and
discovered
by
the
humidity
on
his
eyelashes
why
he
had
withdrawn
her
ladyship
tears
were
gliding
down
her
cheeks
miss
egerton
greatly
amazed
at
the
oddness
of
this
closet
scene
turned
to
miss
beaufort
who
a
moment
before
having
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
distressed
countenance
of
the
count
could
only
bow
her
head
to
sophia
sportive
observation
who
is
there
that
can
enter
into
the
secret
folds
of
the
heart
and
know
all
its
miseries
who
participate
in
that
joy
which
dissolves
and
rarifies
man
to
the
essence
of
heaven
soul
must
mingle
with
soul
and
the
ethereal
voice
of
spirits
must
speak
before
these
things
can
be
comprehended
ready
to
suffocate
with
the
emotions
she
repelled
from
her
eyes
mary
gladly
affected
to
be
absorbed
in
the
business
of
the
stage
not
one
object
of
which
she
now
saw
and
with
breathless
attention
lost
not
one
soft
whisper
which
lady
sara
poured
into
the
ear
of
thaddeus
why
asked
her
ladyship
in
a
tremulous
and
low
tone
why
should
we
seek
ideal
sorrows
when
those
of
our
own
hearts
are
beyond
alleviation
happy
rose
sighed
her
ladyship
constantine
continued
she
do
not
you
think
that
adelbert
is
consoled
at
least
by
the
affection
of
that
lovely
woman
like
miss
beaufort
constantine
had
hitherto
replied
with
bows
only
come
added
lady
sara
laying
her
soft
hand
on
his
arm
and
regarding
him
with
a
look
of
tenderness
so
unequivocal
that
he
cast
his
eyes
to
the
ground
while
its
sympathy
really
touched
his
heart
come
repeated
she
animated
by
the
faint
color
which
tinged
his
cheek
you
know
that
i
have
the
care
of
this
party
and
i
must
not
allow
our
only
to
be
melancholy
i
beg
your
pardon
lady
sara
returned
he
gratefully
pressing
the
hand
that
yet
rested
on
his
arm
i
am
not
very
well
i
wish
that
i
had
not
seen
this
play
lady
sara
sunk
into
the
seat
from
which
she
had
risen
he
had
never
before
taken
her
hand
except
when
assisting
her
to
her
carriage
this
pressure
shook
her
very
soul
and
awakened
hopes
which
rendered
her
for
a
moment
incapable
of
sustaining
herself
or
venturing
a
reply
there
was
something
in
the
tones
of
lady
sara
voice
and
in
her
manner
far
more
expressive
than
her
words
mutual
sighs
which
breathed
from
her
ladyship
bosom
and
that
of
thaddeus
as
they
sat
down
made
a
cold
shiver
run
from
the
head
to
the
foot
of
miss
beaufort
mary
surprise
at
the
meaning
of
this
emotion
caused
a
second
tremor
and
with
a
palpitating
heart
she
asked
herself
a
few
questions
could
this
interesting
young
man
whom
every
person
of
sense
appeared
to
esteem
and
respect
sully
his
virtues
by
participating
in
a
passion
with
a
married
woman
no
it
was
impossible
notwithstanding
this
decision
so
absolute
in
his
exculpation
her
pure
heart
felt
a
trembling
secret
resolve
even
for
the
sake
of
the
honor
of
human
nature
she
whispered
to
herself
to
observe
him
so
hereafter
as
to
be
convinced
of
the
real
worth
of
his
principles
before
she
would
allow
any
increase
of
the
interest
his
apparently
reversed
fate
had
created
in
her
compassionate
bosom
what
might
be
altogether
the
extent
of
that
reversed
fate
she
could
form
no
idea
for
though
she
had
heard
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
general
society
of
the
recent
melancholy
fate
of
poland
she
knew
little
of
its
particulars
politics
of
every
kind
and
especially
about
foreign
places
being
an
interdicted
subject
in
the
of
sir
robert
somerset
therefore
the
simply
noble
mind
of
mary
thought
more
of
the
real
nobility
that
might
dwell
in
the
soul
of
this
expatriated
son
of
that
country
than
of
the
possible
appendages
of
rank
he
might
have
left
there
with
her
mind
full
of
these
reflections
she
awaited
the
farce
without
observing
it
when
it
appeared
indeed
none
of
the
party
knew
anything
about
the
piece
to
see
which
they
had
professedly
come
to
the
theatre
excepting
miss
egerton
whose
ever
merry
spirits
had
enjoyed
alone
the
humor
of
totum
in
the
play
and
who
now
laughed
heartily
though
unaccompanied
through
the
ridiculous
whims
of
the
farce
nothing
that
passed
could
totally
disengage
the
mind
of
thaddeus
from
those
remembrances
which
the
recent
drama
had
aroused
when
the
melting
voice
of
lady
sara
in
whispers
tried
to
recall
his
attention
by
a
start
only
did
he
evince
his
recollection
of
not
being
alone
sensible
however
to
the
kindness
of
her
motive
he
exerted
himself
and
by
the
time
the
curtain
dropped
he
had
so
far
rallied
his
presence
of
mind
as
to
be
able
to
attend
to
the
civility
of
seeing
the
ladies
safe
out
of
the
theatre
miss
egerton
laughing
as
he
assisted
her
into
the
carriage
said
i
verily
believe
constantine
had
i
glanced
round
during
the
play
i
should
have
seen
as
pretty
a
lachrymal
scene
between
you
and
lady
sara
as
any
on
the
stage
i
wo
have
this
flirting
i
declare
i
will
tell
captain
ross
she
continued
talking
but
turning
about
to
offer
his
service
to
miss
beaufort
he
heard
no
more
miss
beaufort
however
in
thought
felt
strangely
she
felt
cold
and
reserved
and
undesignedly
she
appeared
what
she
felt
there
was
a
grave
dignity
in
her
air
accompanied
with
a
collectedness
and
stillness
in
her
before
animated
countenance
which
astonished
and
chilled
thaddeus
though
she
had
bowed
her
head
and
given
him
her
hand
to
put
her
into
the
coach
on
their
way
home
miss
egerton
ran
over
the
merits
of
the
play
and
farce
rallied
thaddeus
on
the
tall
pole
which
she
threatened
should
be
his
epithet
whenever
he
offended
her
and
then
flying
from
subject
to
subject
talked
herself
and
her
hearers
so
weary
that
they
internally
rejoiced
when
the
carriage
stopped
in
grosvenor
place
after
they
had
severally
paid
their
respects
to
lady
tinemouth
who
being
indisposed
was
lying
on
the
sofa
she
desired
thaddeus
to
draw
a
chair
near
her
i
want
to
learn
said
she
what
you
think
of
our
english
theatre
prithee
do
ask
him
cried
miss
egerton
pouring
out
a
glass
of
water
we
have
seen
a
tremendous
brother
pole
of
his
who
i
believe
has
off
with
all
his
spirits
why
he
has
been
looking
as
rueful
as
a
man
all
the
night
and
as
for
lady
sara
and
i
could
vow
miss
beaufort
too
they
have
been
two
niobes
tears
so
good
folks
i
must
drink
better
health
to
you
to
save
myself
from
the
vapors
what
is
all
this
mr
constantine
asked
the
countess
addressing
thaddeus
whose
eyes
had
glanced
with
a
ray
of
delighted
surprise
on
the
blushing
though
displeased
face
of
miss
beaufort
my
weakness
replied
he
commanding
down
a
rising
tremor
in
his
voice
and
turning
to
her
ladyship
the
play
relates
to
a
native
of
poland
one
who
like
myself
an
exile
in
a
strange
land
is
subjected
to
sufferings
and
contumelies
the
bravest
spirits
may
find
hard
to
bear
any
man
may
combat
misery
but
even
the
most
intrepid
will
shrink
from
insult
this
i
believe
is
the
sum
of
the
story
its
resemblance
in
some
points
to
my
own
affected
me
and
added
he
looking
gratefully
at
lady
sara
and
timidly
towards
miss
beaufort
if
these
ladies
have
sympathized
with
emotions
against
which
i
strove
but
could
not
entirely
conceal
i
owe
to
it
the
sweetest
consolation
now
in
the
power
of
fate
to
bestow
poor
constantine
cried
sophia
egerton
patting
his
head
with
one
hand
whilst
with
the
other
she
wiped
a
tear
from
her
always
smiling
eye
forgive
me
if
i
have
hurt
you
i
like
you
vastly
though
i
must
now
and
then
laugh
at
you
you
know
i
hate
dismals
so
let
this
tune
enliven
us
all
and
flying
to
her
piano
she
played
and
sang
two
or
three
merry
airs
till
the
countess
commanded
her
to
the
table
at
this
most
sociable
repast
of
the
whole
day
cheerfulness
seemed
again
to
disperse
the
gloom
which
had
threatened
the
circle
thaddeus
set
the
example
his
unrestrained
and
elegant
conversation
acquired
new
pathos
from
the
anguish
that
was
driven
back
to
his
heart
like
the
beds
of
rivers
which
infuse
their
own
nature
with
the
current
his
hidden
grief
imparted
an
indescribable
interest
and
charm
to
all
his
sentiments
and
actions

when
this

in
the
year
domestic
hours
were
earlier
and
the
supper

had
not
then
dissipation
and

rest
for
a
consequence
mary
now
beheld
him
in
his
real
character
unmolested
by
the
haughty
presence
of
miss
dundas
he
became
unreserved
intelligent
and
enchanting
he
seemed
master
of
every
subject
talked
on
and
discoursed
on
all
with
a
grace
which
corroborated
her
waking
visions
that
he
was
as
some
bright
star
fallen
from
his
sphere
with
the
increase
of
miss
beaufort
admiration
of
the
count
fine
talents
she
gradually
lost
the
recollection
of
what
had
occupied
her
mind
relative
to
lady
sara
and
her
own
beautiful
countenance
dilating
into
confidence
and
delight
the
evening
passed
away
with
chastened
pleasure
until
the
little
party
separated
for
their
several
homes
lady
tinemouth
was
more
than
ever
fascinated
by
the
lovely
miss
beaufort
miss
beaufort
was
equally
pleased
with
the
animation
of
the
countess
but
when
she
thought
on
thaddeus
she
was
surprised
interested
absorbed
lady
sara
ross
reflections
were
not
less
delightful
she
dwelt
with
redoubled
passion
on
that
look
from
the
count
eyes
that
touch
of
his
hand
which
she
thought
were
signs
of
a
reciprocal
awakened
flame
both
actions
were
forgotten
by
him
the
moment
after
they
were
committed
yet
he
was
not
ungrateful
but
whilst
he
acknowledged
her
generous
sympathy
at
that
time
he
could
not
but
see
that
she
was
straying
to
the
verge
of
a
precipice
which
no
thoroughly
virtuous
woman
should
ever
venture
to
approach
he
found
a
refuge
from
so
painful
a
meditation
in
the
idea
of
the
ingenuous
mary
on
whose
modest
countenance
virtue
seemed
to
have
set
her
seal
whilst
recollecting
the
pitying
kindness
of
her
voice
and
looks
his
heart
owned
the
empire
of
purity
and
in
the
contemplation
of
her
unaffected
excellence
he
the
more
deplored
the
witcheries
of
lady
sara
and
the
dangerous
uses
to
which
her
impetuous
feelings
addressed
them
chapter
xxix
hyde
park
next
morning
when
thaddeus
approached
the
general
bed
to
give
him
his
coffee
he
found
him
feverish
and
his
mind
more
than
usually
unsettled
the
count
awaited
with
anxiety
the
arrival
of
the
benevolent
cavendish
whom
he
expected
when
he
appeared
he
declared
his
increased
alarm
cavendish
having
felt
the
patient
pulse
expressed
a
wish
that
he
could
be
induced
to
take
a
little
exercise
thaddeus
had
often
urged
this
necessity
to
his
friend
but
met
with
constant
refusals
he
hopelessly
repeated
the
entreaty
now
when
to
his
surprise
and
satisfaction
the
old
man
instantly
consented
having
seen
him
comfortably
dressed
for
the
count
attended
to
these
minutiae
with
the
care
of
a
son
the
doctor
said
they
must
ride
with
him
to
hyde
park
where
he
would
put
them
out
to
walk
until
he
had
made
a
visit
to
piccadilly
whence
he
would
return
and
take
them
home
the
general
not
only
expressed
pleasure
at
the
drive
but
as
the
air
was
warm
and
balmy
it
being
about
the
beginning
of
june
he
made
no
objection
to
the
proposed
subsequent
walk
he
admired
the
park
the
serpentine
river
the
cottages
on
its
bank
and
seemed
highly
diverted
by
the
horsemen
and
carriages
in
the
ring
the
pertinence
of
his
remarks
afforded
thaddeus
a
ray
of
hope
that
his
senses
had
not
entirely
lost
their
union
with
reason
and
with
awakened
confidence
he
was
contemplating
what
might
be
the
happy
effects
of
constant
exercise
when
the
general
complaints
of
weariness
obliged
him
to
stop
near
piccadilly
gate
and
wait
the
arrival
of
the
doctor
coach
he
was
standing
against
the
railing
supporting
butzou
and
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
shading
his
aged
friend
face
from
the
sun
when
two
or
three
carriages
driving
in
he
met
the
eye
of
miss
euphemia
dundas
who
pulling
the
exclaimed
bless
me
constantine
who
expected
to
see
you
here
why
your
note
told
us
you
were
confined
with
a
sick
friend
thaddeus
bowed
to
her
and
still
sustaining
the
debilitated
frame
of
the
general
on
his
arm
advanced
to
the
side
of
the
coach
miss
beaufort
who
now
looked
out
expressed
her
hope
that
his
invalid
was
better
this
is
the
friend
i
mentioned
said
the
count
turning
his
eyes
on
the
mild
features
of
butzou
his
physician
having
ordered
him
to
walk
i
accompanied
him
hither
dear
me
how
ill
you
look
sir
cried
euphemia
addressing
the
poor
invalid
but
you
are
attended
by
a
kind
friend
my
dear
lord
exclaimed
the
old
man
not
regarding
what
she
said
i
must
go
home
i
am
tired
pray
call
up
the
carriage
euphemia
was
again
opening
her
mouth
to
speak
but
miss
beaufort
perceiving
a
look
of
distress
in
the
expressive
features
of
thaddeus
interrupted
her
by
saying
constantine
i
know
we
detain
you
and
oppress
that
gentleman
whose
pardon
we
ought
to
beg
she
bowed
her
head
to
the
general
whose
white
hairs
were
blowing
about
his
face
as
he
attempted
to
pull
the
count
towards
the
pathway
my
friend
can
not
thank
you
kind
miss
beaufort
cried
thaddeus
with
a
look
of
gratitude
that
called
the
brightest
roses
to
her
cheeks
but
i
do
from
my
heart
here
it
is
pray
my
dear
lord
come
along
cried
butzou
thaddeus
seeing
that
his
information
was
right
bowed
to
the
ladies
and
their
carriage
drove
off
though
the
wheels
of
lady
dundas
coach
rolled
away
from
the
retreating
figures
of
thaddeus
and
his
friend
the
images
of
both
occupied
the
meditations
of
euphemia
and
miss
beaufort
whilst
and
in
silence
they
made
the
circuit
of
the
park
when
the
carriage
again
passed
the
spot
on
which
the
subject
of
their
thoughts
had
stood
mary
almost
mechanically
looked
out
towards
the
gate
is
he
gone
yet
asked
euphemia
sighing
deeply
mary
drew
in
her
head
with
the
quickness
of
conscious
guilt
and
whilst
a
color
stained
her
face
which
of
itself
might
have
betrayed
her
prevarication
she
asked
who
constantine
replied
euphemia
with
a
second
sigh
did
you
remark
mary
how
gracefully
he
supported
that
sick
old
gentleman
was
it
not
the
very
personification
of
youth
upholding
the
fainting
steps
of
age
he
put
me
in
mind
of
the
charming
young
prince
whose
name
i
forget
leading
the
old
belisarius
yes
returned
mary
ashamed
of
the
momentary
insincerity
couched
in
her
former
uncertain
replying
word
who
yet
still
adding
while
trying
to
smile
but
some
people
might
call
our
ideas
enthusiasm
so
all
tell
me
replied
euphemia
so
all
say
who
neither
possess
the
sensibility
nor
the
candor
to
allow
that
great
merit
may
exist
without
being
associated
with
great
rank
yet
cried
she
in
a
more
animated
tone
i
have
my
doubts
mary
of
his
being
what
he
seems
did
you
observe
the
sick
gentleman
call
him
lord
i
did
returned
mary
and
i
was
not
surprised
such
manners
as
constantine
are
not
to
be
acquired
in
a
cottage
dear
dear
mary
cried
euphemia
flinging
her
ivory
arms
round
her
neck
how
i
love
you
for
these
words
you
are
generous
you
think
nobly
and
i
will
no
longer
hesitate
to
to
and
breaking
off
she
hid
her
head
in
miss
beaufort
bosom
mary
heart
throbbed
her
cheeks
grew
pale
and
almost
unconsciously
she
wished
to
stop
the
tide
of
miss
dundas
confidence
dear
euphemia
answered
she
your
regard
for
this
interesting
exile
is
very
praiseworthy
but
beware
of
she
hesitated
a
remorseful
twitch
in
her
own
breast
stayed
the
warning
that
was
rising
to
her
tongue
and
blushing
at
a
motive
she
could
not
at
the
instant
assign
to
friendship
selfishness
or
to
any
interest
she
would
not
avow
to
herself
she
touched
the
cheek
of
euphemia
with
her
quivering
lips
euphemia
had
finished
the
sentence
for
her
and
raising
her
head
exclaimed
what
should
i
fear
in
esteeming
constantine
is
he
not
the
most
captivating
creature
in
the
world
and
for
his
person
oh
mary
he
is
so
beautiful
that
when
the
library
is
filled
with
the
handsomest
men
in
town
the
moment
constantine
enters
their
reign
is
over
i
compare
them
with
his
godlike
figure
and
i
feel
as
one
looking
at
the
sun
all
other
objects
appear
dim
and
shapeless
i
hope
returned
mary
pressing
her
own
forehead
with
her
hand
her
head
beginning
to
ache
strangely
that
constantine
does
not
owe
your
friendship
to
his
fine
person
i
think
his
mental
qualities
are
more
deserving
of
such
a
gift
do
look
so
severe
dear
mary
cried
miss
dundas
observing
her
contracting
brow
are
you
displeased
with
me
mary
displeasure
was
at
the
austerity
of
her
own
words
and
not
at
her
auditor
raising
her
eyes
with
a
smile
she
gently
replied
i
do
not
mean
my
dear
girl
to
be
severe
but
i
would
wish
for
the
honor
of
our
sex
that
the
objects
which
attract
either
our
love
or
our
compassion
should
have
something
more
precious
than
mere
exterior
beauty
to
engage
our
interest
well
i
will
soon
be
satisfied
cried
euphemia
in
a
gayer
tone
as
they
drove
through
grosvenor
gate
we
all
know
that
constantine
is
sensible
and
accomplished
he
writes
poetry
like
an
angel
both
in
french
and
italian
i
have
hundreds
of
mottoes
composed
by
him
one
of
them
mary
is
on
the
i
gave
you
yesterday
and
what
is
more
i
will
ask
him
why
that
old
gentleman
called
him
lord
it
he
be
a
lord
exclaimed
she
what
then
inquired
the
eloquent
eyes
of
mary
do
look
so
impertinent
my
dear
cried
the
now
animated
beauty
i
positively
wo
say
another
word
to
you
today
miss
beaufort
headache
became
so
painful
she
rejoiced
when
euphemia
ceased
and
the
carriage
drew
up
to
lady
dundas
door
a
night
of
almost
unremitted
sleep
performed
such
good
effects
on
the
general
condition
of
general
butzou
that
cavendish
thought
his
patient
so
much
better
as
to
sanction
his
hoping
the
best
consequences
from
a
frequent
repetition
of
air
and
exercise
when
the
drive
and
walk
had
accordingly
been
repeated
the
following
day
thaddeus
left
his
friend
to
his
maps
and
little
nanny
attendance
and
once
more
took
the
way
to
harley
street
he
found
only
miss
dundas
with
her
sister
in
the
study
mary
against
her
will
which
she
opposed
because
it
was
her
will
had
gone
out
shopping
with
miss
dorothy
and
lady
dundas
miss
dundas
left
the
room
the
moment
she
had
finished
her
lessons
delighted
at
being
with
the
object
of
her
romantic
fancies
euphemia
forgot
that
she
was
to
act
the
retreating
character
of
madame
heroine
and
shutting
her
book
the
instant
diana
disappeared
all
at
once
opened
her
attack
on
his
confidence
to
her
eager
questions
which
the
few
words
of
the
general
had
excited
the
count
afforded
no
other
reply
than
that
his
poor
friend
knew
not
what
he
said
having
been
a
long
time
in
a
state
of
mental
derangement
this
explanation
caused
a
momentary
mortification
in
the
imaginative
euphemia
but
her
busy
mind
was
nimble
in
its
erection
of
airy
castles
and
she
rallied
in
a
moment
with
the
idea
that
he
might
be
more
than
a
lord
at
any
rate
let
him
be
what
he
may
he
charmed
her
and
he
had
much
ado
to
parry
the
increasing
boldness
of
her
speeches
without
letting
her
see
they
were
understood
you
are
very
diffident
constantine
cried
she
looking
down
if
i
consider
you
worthy
of
my
friendship
why
should
make
disqualifying
assertions
every
man
madam
returned
thaddeus
bowing
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
must
be
diffident
of
deserving
the
honor
of
your
notice
there
is
no
man
living
replied
she
to
whom
i
would
offer
my
friendship
but
yourself
thaddeus
bit
his
lip
he
knew
not
what
to
answer
bowing
a
second
time
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
drew
his
hat
towards
him
euphemia
eyes
followed
the
movement
you
are
in
a
prodigious
haste
mr
constantine
i
know
i
intrude
madam
and
i
have
promised
to
be
with
my
sick
friend
at
an
early
hour
well
you
may
go
since
you
are
obliged
returned
the
pretty
euphemia
rising
and
smiling
sweetly
as
she
laid
one
hand
on
his
arm
and
put
the
other
into
her
tucker
she
drew
out
a
little
white
leather
marked
on
the
back
in
gold
letters
with
the
words
and
slipping
it
into
his
hand
there
receive
that
or
whatever
else
you
may
be
called
and
retain
it
as
the
first
pledge
of
euphemia
dundas
friendship
thaddeus
colored
as
he
took
it
and
again
having
recourse
to
the
convenient
reply
of
a
bow
left
the
room
in
embarrassed
vexation
there
was
an
indelicacy
in
this
absolutely
wooing
conduct
of
miss
euphemia
which
notwithstanding
her
beauty
and
the
softness
that
was
its
vehicle
filled
him
with
the
deepest
disgust
he
could
not
trace
real
affection
in
her
words
or
manner
and
that
any
woman
instigated
by
a
mere
whim
should
lay
aside
the
maidenly
reserves
of
her
sex
and
actually
court
his
regard
surprised
whilst
it
impelled
him
to
loathe
her
they
who
adopt
euphemia
sentiments
and
alas
there
are
some
can
be
little
aware
of
the
conclusion
which
society
infer
from
such
intemperate
behavior
the
mistaken
creature
who
either
at
the
impulsion
of
her
own
disposition
or
by
the
influence
of
example
is
induced
to
despise
the
guard
of
modesty
literally
forsakes
the
guide
of
her
youth
and
leaves
herself
open
to
every
attack
which
man
can
devise
against
her
by
levelling
the
barrier
raised
by
nature
she
herself
exposes
the
stronghold
of
virtue
and
may
find
too
late
for
recovery
that
what
modesty
has
abandoned
is
not
long
spared
by
honor
euphemia
affected
attachment
suggested
to
thaddeus
a
few
unpleasant
recollections
respecting
the
fervent
and
unequivocal
passion
of
lady
sara
though
guilty
it
sprung
from
a
headlong
ardor
of
disposition
which
formed
at
once
the
error
and
its
palliation
he
saw
that
love
was
not
welcomed
by
her
at
least
he
thought
so
as
a
plaything
but
struggled
against
as
with
a
foe
he
had
witnessed
her
tortures
he
pitied
them
and
to
render
her
happy
would
gladly
have
made
any
sacrifice
short
of
his
conscience
too
well
assured
of
being
all
the
world
to
lady
sara
the
belief
that
miss
euphemia
liked
him
only
from
idleness
caprice
and
contradiction
caused
him
to
repay
her
overtures
with
decided
contempt
when
he
arrived
at
home
he
threw
on
his
table
the
whose
unambiguous
motto
made
him
scorn
her
and
almost
himself
for
being
the
object
of
such
folly
looking
round
his
humble
room
whose
floor
and
uncurtained
windows
announced
anything
but
elegance
poor
euphemia
said
he
how
would
you
be
dismayed
were
the
indigent
constantine
to
really
take
you
at
your
word
and
bring
you
home
to
a
habitation
like
this
chapter
xxx
influences
of
character
the
recital
of
the
preceding
scene
which
was
communicated
to
miss
beaufort
by
euphemia
filled
her
with
still
more
doubting
thoughts
mary
could
discover
no
reason
why
the
old
gentleman
mental
derangement
should
dignify
his
friend
with
titles
he
had
never
borne
she
remarked
to
herself
that
his
answer
to
euphemia
was
evasive
she
remembered
his
emotion
and
apology
on
seeing
kemble
in
adelbert
and
uniting
with
these
facts
his
manners
and
acquirements
so
far
beyond
the
charges
of
any
subordinate
rank
she
could
finally
retain
no
doubt
of
his
being
at
least
well
born
thus
this
mysterious
constantine
continued
to
occupy
her
hourly
thoughts
during
the
space
of
two
months
in
which
time
she
had
full
opportunity
to
learn
much
of
a
character
with
whom
she
associated
almost
every
day
at
lady
tinemouth
one
of
whose
evening
guests
she
frequently
became
she
beheld
him
disencumbered
of
that
armor
of
reserve
which
he
usually
wore
in
harley
street
in
the
circle
of
the
countess
mary
saw
him
welcomed
like
an
idolized
being
before
whose
cheering
influence
all
frowns
and
clouds
must
disappear
when
he
entered
the
smile
resumed
its
seat
on
the
languid
features
of
lady
tinemouth
miss
egerton
eye
lighted
up
to
keener
archness
lady
sara
circassian
orbs
floated
in
pleasure
and
for
mary
herself
her
breast
heaved
her
cheeks
glowed
her
hands
trembled
a
quick
sigh
fluttered
in
her
bosom
and
whilst
she
remained
in
his
presence
she
believed
that
happiness
had
lost
its
usual
evanescent
property
and
become
tangible
to
hold
and
press
upon
her
heart
mary
who
investigated
the
cause
of
these
tremors
on
her
pillow
bedewed
it
with
delicious
though
bitter
tears
when
her
alarmed
soul
whispered
that
she
nourished
for
this
amiable
foreigner
a
something
than
friendship
dearer
ah
is
it
come
to
this
cried
she
pressing
down
her
saturated
eyelids
with
her
hand
am
i
at
last
to
love
a
man
who
perhaps
never
casts
a
thought
on
me
how
despicable
shall
i
become
in
my
own
eyes
the
pride
of
woman
puts
this
charge
to
her
taken
heart
that
heart
which
seems
tempered
of
the
purest
clay
and
warmed
with
the
fire
of
heaven
that
tender
and
disinterested
heart
asks
as
its
appeal
what
is
love
is
it
not
an
admiration
of
all
that
is
beautiful
in
nature
and
in
the
soul
is
it
not
a
union
of
loveliness
with
truth
is
it
not
a
passion
whose
sole
object
is
the
rapture
of
contemplating
the
supreme
beauty
of
this
combined
character
where
then
cried
the
enthusiastic
mary
where
is
the
shame
that
can
be
annexed
to
my
loving
constantine
if
it
be
honorable
to
love
delineated
excellence
it
must
be
equally
so
to
love
it
when
embodied
in
a
human
shape
such
it
is
in
constantine
and
if
love
be
the
reflected
light
of
virtue
i
may
cease
to
arraign
myself
of
that
which
otherwise
i
would
have
scorned
therefore
constantine
cried
she
raising
her
clasped
hands
whilst
renewed
tears
streamed
over
her
face
i
will
love
thee
i
will
pray
for
thy
happiness
though
its
partner
should
be
euphemia
dundas
mary
eager
imagination
would
not
allow
her
to
perceive
those
obstacles
in
the
shapes
of
pride
and
prudence
which
would
stand
in
the
way
of
his
obtaining
euphemia
hand
its
light
showed
to
her
only
a
rival
in
the
person
of
the
little
beauty
but
from
her
direct
confidence
she
continued
to
retreat
with
abhorrence
had
euphemia
been
more
deserving
of
constantine
miss
beaufort
believed
she
would
have
been
less
reluctant
to
hear
that
she
loved
him
but
mary
could
not
avoid
seeing
that
miss
dundas
possessed
little
to
ensure
connubial
comfort
if
mere
beauty
and
accidental
flights
of
good
humor
were
not
to
be
admitted
into
the
scale
she
was
weak
in
understanding
timid
in
principle
absurd
in
almost
every
opinion
she
adopted
and
as
for
love
true
dignified
respectable
love
she
knew
nothing
of
the
sentiment
whilst
miss
beaufort
meditated
on
this
meagre
schedule
of
her
merits
the
probability
that
even
such
a
man
as
constantine
might
sacrifice
himself
to
flattery
and
to
splendor
stung
her
to
the
soul
the
more
she
reflected
on
it
the
more
she
conceived
it
possible
euphemia
was
considered
a
beauty
of
the
day
her
affectation
of
refined
prettiness
pleased
many
and
might
charm
constantine
she
was
mistress
of
fifty
thousand
pounds
and
did
not
esteem
it
necessary
to
conceal
from
her
favorite
the
empire
he
had
acquired
perhaps
there
was
generosity
in
this
openness
if
so
what
might
it
not
effect
on
a
grateful
disposition
or
rather
her
mortified
heart
murmured
in
the
words
of
her
aunt
dorothy
how
might
it
not
operate
on
the
mind
of
one
of
that
sex
which
at
the
best
is
as
often
moved
by
caprice
as
by
feeling
mary
blushed
at
her
adoption
of
this
opinion
and
angry
with
herself
for
the
injustice
which
a
lurking
jealousy
had
excited
in
her
to
apply
to
constantine
noble
nature
she
resolved
whatever
might
be
her
struggles
to
promote
his
happiness
though
even
with
euphemia
to
the
utmost
of
her
power
the
next
morning
when
miss
beaufort
saw
the
study
door
opened
for
her
entrance
she
found
constantine
at
his
station
literally
baited
between
miss
dundas
and
her
honorable
lover
at
such
moments
mary
appeared
the
kindest
of
the
kind
she
loved
to
see
constantine
smile
and
whenever
she
could
produce
that
effect
by
turning
the
spleen
of
these
polite
sneerers
against
themselves
his
smiles
which
ever
entered
her
heart
afforded
her
a
banquet
for
hours
after
his
departure
mary
drew
out
her
netting
which
was
a
purse
for
lady
tinemouth
and
taking
a
seat
beside
euphemia
united
with
her
to
occupy
his
attention
entirely
that
he
might
not
catch
even
one
of
those
insolent
glances
which
were
passing
between
lascelles
and
a
new
visitant
the
pretty
lady
hilliars
this
lady
seemed
to
take
extreme
pleasure
in
accosting
thaddeus
by
the
appellation
of
friend
my
good
man
and
similar
squibs
of
insult
with
which
the
prosperous
assail
the
unfortunate
such
random
shots
they
know
often
inflict
the
most
galling
wounds
however
friend
my
good
man
and
disappointed
this
lady
small
artillery
of
effect
he
seemed
invulnerable
both
to
her
insolence
and
to
her
affectation
for
to
be
thought
a
wit
by
even
miss
dundas
emigrant
tutor
was
not
to
be
despised
though
at
the
very
moment
in
which
she
desired
his
admiration
she
supposed
her
haughtiness
had
impressed
him
with
a
proper
sense
of
his
own
meanness
and
a
high
conception
of
her
dignity
she
jumped
about
the
room
assumed
infantine
airs
played
with
euphemia
fondled
it
seated
herself
on
the
floor
and
swept
the
carpet
with
her
fine
flaxen
tresses
but
she
performed
the
routine
of
captivation
in
vain
thaddeus
recollected
having
seen
this
pretty
baby
in
her
peculiar
character
of
a
profligate
wife
pawning
her
own
and
her
husband
property
he
remembered
this
and
the
united
shafts
of
her
charms
and
folly
fell
unnoticed
to
the
ground
when
thaddeus
took
his
leave
miss
beaufort
as
was
her
custom
retired
for
an
hour
to
read
in
her
before
she
directed
her
attention
to
the
toilet
she
opened
a
book
and
ran
over
a
few
pages
of
madame
de
stael
treatise
on
the
passions
but
such
reasoning
was
too
abstract
for
her
present
frame
of
mind
and
she
laid
the
volume
down
she
dipped
her
pen
in
the
inkstand
being
a
letter
in
debt
to
her
guardian
she
thought
she
would
defray
it
now
she
accomplished
my
dear
uncle
and
stopped
whilst
she
rested
on
her
elbow
and
heedless
of
what
she
was
doing
picked
the
feather
of
her
quill
to
pieces
no
other
idea
offered
itself
than
the
figure
of
thaddeus
sitting
in
youthful
beauty
and
surrounded
by
the
contumelies
with
which
the
unworthy
hope
to
disparage
the
merit
they
can
neither
emulate
nor
overlook
uneasy
with
herself
she
pushed
the
table
away
and
leaning
her
cheek
on
her
arm
gazed
into
the
rainbow
varieties
of
a
beaupot
of
flowers
which
occupied
the
fireplace
even
their
gay
colors
appeared
to
fade
before
her
sight
and
present
to
her
vacant
eye
the
form
of
thaddeus
with
the
melancholy
air
which
shaded
his
movements
she
turned
round
but
could
not
disengage
herself
from
the
spirit
that
was
within
her
his
sighs
seemed
yet
to
thrill
in
her
ear
and
weigh
upon
her
heart
incomparable
young
man
cried
she
starting
up
why
art
thou
so
wretched
oh
lady
tinemouth
why
have
you
told
me
of
his
many
virtues
why
have
i
convinced
myself
that
what
you
said
is
true
oh
why
was
i
formed
to
love
an
excellence
which
i
never
can
approach
the
natural
reply
to
these
questions
suggesting
itself
she
assented
with
a
tear
to
the
whisperings
of
her
heart
that
when
cool
calculating
reason
would
banish
the
affections
it
is
incapable
of
filling
their
place
she
rang
the
bell
for
her
maid
marshall
who
dines
with
lady
dundas
i
believe
replied
the
girl
lascelles
lady
hilliars
and
the
marquis
of
elesmere
i
dislike
them
all
three
cried
mary
with
an
impatience
to
which
she
was
little
liable
dress
me
how
you
like
i
am
indifferent
to
my
appearance
marshall
obeyed
the
commands
of
her
lady
who
hoping
to
divert
her
thoughts
took
up
the
poems
of
egerton
brydges
but
the
attempt
only
deepened
her
emotion
for
every
line
in
that
exquisite
little
volume
gives
a
very
echo
to
the
seat
where
love
is
throned
she
closed
the
book
and
sighed
marshall
having
fixed
the
last
pearl
comb
in
her
mistress
beautiful
hair
and
observing
that
something
was
wrong
that
disquieted
her
exclaimed
dear
you
are
so
pale
i
wish
i
might
put
on
some
gayer
ornaments
no
returned
mary
glancing
a
look
at
her
languid
features
no
marshall
i
appear
as
well
as
i
desire
any
chance
of
passing
unnoticed
in
company
i
dislike
is
worth
retaining
no
one
will
be
here
this
evening
whom
i
care
to
please
she
was
mistaken
other
company
had
been
invited
besides
those
whom
the
maid
mentioned
but
miss
beaufort
continued
from
seven
until
ten
the
period
at
which
the
ladies
left
the
table
the
annoyed
victim
of
the
insipid
and
pert
compliments
of
lord
elesmere
sick
of
his
subjectless
and
dragging
conversation
she
gladly
followed
lady
dundas
to
the
where
opening
her
knitting
case
she
took
her
station
in
a
remote
corner
after
half
an
hour
had
elapsed
the
gentlemen
from
below
recruited
by
fresh
company
thronged
in
fast
and
notwithstanding
it
was
styled
a
family
party
miss
beaufort
saw
many
new
faces
amongst
whom
she
observed
an
elderly
clergyman
who
was
looking
about
for
a
chair
the
yawning
lascelles
threw
himself
along
the
only
vacant
sofa
just
as
the
reverend
gentleman
approached
it
miss
beaufort
immediately
rose
and
was
moving
on
to
another
room
when
the
coxcomb
springing
up
begged
permission
to
admire
her
work
and
without
permission
taking
it
from
her
pursued
her
twisting
the
purse
around
his
fingers
and
talking
all
the
while
mary
walked
forward
smiling
with
contempt
until
they
reached
the
saloon
where
the
misses
dundas
were
closely
engaged
in
conversation
with
the
marquis
of
elesmere
lascelles
who
trembled
for
his
golconda
at
this
sight
stepped
briskly
up
miss
beaufort
who
did
not
wish
to
lose
sight
of
her
purse
whilst
in
the
power
of
such
a
lothario
followed
him
and
placed
herself
against
the
arm
of
the
sofa
on
which
euphemia
sat
lascelles
now
bowed
his
scented
locks
to
diana
in
vain
lord
elesmere
was
describing
the
last
heat
at
newmarket
and
the
attention
of
neither
lady
could
be
withdrawn
the
beau
became
so
irritated
by
the
neglect
of
euphemia
and
so
nettled
at
her
sister
overlooking
him
that
assuming
a
gay
air
he
struck
miss
dundas
arm
a
smart
stroke
with
miss
beaufort
purse
and
laughing
to
show
the
strong
opposition
between
his
broad
white
teeth
and
the
miserable
mouth
of
his
lordly
rival
hoped
to
alarm
him
by
his
familiarity
and
to
obtain
a
triumph
over
the
ladies
by
degrading
them
in
the
eyes
of
the
peer
miss
dundas
demanded
he
who
was
that
quiz
of
a
man
in
black
your
sister
walked
with
the
other
day
in
portland
place
me
cried
euphemia
surprised
ay
returned
he
i
was
crossing
from
weymouth
street
when
i
perceived
you
accost
a
person
a
courier
from
the
moon
perhaps
you
may
remember
you
sauntered
with
him
as
far
as
sir
william
miller
i
would
have
joined
you
but
seeing
the
family
standing
in
the
balcony
i
did
not
wish
them
to
suppose
that
i
knew
anything
of
such
queer
company
who
was
it
euphemia
inquired
miss
dundas
in
a
severe
tone
i
wonder
he
affects
to
be
ignorant
answered
her
sister
angrily
he
knows
very
well
it
was
only
mr
constantine
and
who
is
mr
constantine
demanded
the
marquis
lascelles
shrugged
his
shoulders
my
lord
a
fellow
whom
nobody
knows
a
teacher
of
languages
giving
himself
the
airs
of
a
prince
a
writer
of
poetry
and
a
man
who
will
draw
you
your
house
or
dogs
if
you
will
pay
him
for
it
mary
heart
swelled
what
a
french
emigrant
drawled
his
lordship
dropping
his
lip
and
the
lovely
euphemia
wishes
to
soothe
his
sorrows
no
my
lord
stammered
euphemia
he
is
he
is
what
interrupted
lascelles
with
a
malicious
grin
a
wandering
beggar
who
thrusts
himself
into
society
which
may
some
day
repay
his
insolence
with
chastisement
and
for
the
people
who
encourage
him
they
had
better
beware
of
being
themselves
driven
from
all
good
company
such
confounders
of
degrees
ought
to
be
degraded
from
the
rank
they
disgrace
i
understand
his
chief
protectress
is
lady
tinemouth
his
second
lady
sara
ross
who
by
way
of
le
temps
shows
she
is
not
quite
inconsolable
at
the
absence
of
her
husband
mary
pale
and
trembling
at
the
scandal
his
last
words
insinuated
opened
her
lips
to
speak
when
miss
dundas
whose
angry
eyes
darted
from
her
sister
to
her
lover
exclaimed
lascelles
i
know
not
what
you
mean
the
subject
you
have
taken
up
is
below
my
discussion
yet
i
must
confess
if
euphemia
has
ever
disgraced
herself
so
far
as
to
be
seen
walking
with
a
schoolmaster
she
deserves
all
you
have
said
and
why
might
i
not
walk
with
him
sister
asked
the
poor
culprit
suddenly
recovering
from
her
confusion
and
looking
pertly
up
who
knew
that
he
was
not
a
gentleman
everybody
interrupted
lascelles
and
when
a
young
woman
of
fashion
condescends
to
be
seen
equalizing
herself
with
a
creature
depending
on
his
wits
for
support
she
is
very
likely
to
incur
the
contempt
of
her
acquaintance
and
the
censure
of
her
friends
she
is
sir
said
mary
holding
down
her
indignant
heart
and
forcing
her
countenance
to
appear
serene
for
she
ought
to
know
that
if
those
men
of
fashion
who
have
no
wit
to
be
either
their
support
or
ornament
did
not
proscribe
talents
from
their
circle
they
must
soon
find
greater
glory
dim
the
less
true
madam
cried
lord
berrington
who
having
entered
during
the
contest
had
stood
unobserved
until
this
moment
and
their
gold
and
tinsel
would
prove
but
dross
and
bubble
if
struck
by
the
ithuriel
touch
of
merit
when
so
advocated
mary
turned
at
the
sound
of
his
philanthropic
voice
and
gave
him
one
of
those
glances
which
go
immediately
to
the
soul
come
miss
beaufort
cried
he
taking
her
hand
i
see
the
young
musician
yonder
who
has
so
recently
astonished
the
public
i
believe
he
is
going
to
sing
let
us
leave
this
discordant
corner
and
seek
harmony
by
his
side
mary
gladly
acceded
to
his
request
and
seating
herself
a
few
paces
from
the
musical
party
berrington
took
his
station
behind
her
chair
when
the
last
melting
notes
of
from
shades
of
night
died
upon
her
ear
mary
eyes
full
of
admiration
and
transport
which
the
power
of
association
rendered
more
intense
remained
fixed
on
the
singer
lord
berrington
smiled
at
the
vivid
expression
of
her
countenance
and
as
the
young
orpheus
moved
from
the
instrument
exclaimed
come
miss
beaufort
i
wo
allow
you
quite
to
fancy
braham
the
god
on
whom
enamored
clitie
turned
and
gazed
footnote
this
accomplished
singer
and
composer
still
lives
one
of
the
most
admired
ornaments
of
the
british
listen
a
little
to
my
merits
do
you
know
that
if
it
were
not
for
my
timely
lectures
lascelles
would
grow
the
most
insufferable
gossip
about
town
there
is
not
a
match
nor
a
divorce
near
james
of
which
he
can
not
repeat
all
the
whys
and
wherefores
i
call
him
sir
benjamin
backbite
and
i
believe
he
hates
me
worse
than
asmodeus
himself
such
a
man
dislike
rejoined
mary
is
the
highest
encomium
he
can
bestow
i
never
yet
heard
him
speak
well
of
any
person
who
did
not
resemble
himself
and
he
is
not
consistent
even
there
resumed
the
viscount
i
am
not
sure
i
have
always
heard
him
speak
in
the
gentlest
terms
of
miss
dundas
yet
on
that
i
can
not
quite
blame
him
for
on
my
honor
she
provokes
me
beyond
any
woman
breathing
many
women
replied
mary
smiling
would
esteem
that
a
flattering
instance
of
power
and
like
everything
that
flatters
returned
he
it
would
tell
a
falsehood
a
shrew
can
provoke
a
man
who
detests
her
as
to
miss
dundas
notwithstanding
her
parade
of
learning
she
generally
espouses
the
wrong
side
of
the
argument
and
i
may
say
with
somebody
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
that
any
one
who
knows
diana
dundas
never
need
be
at
a
loss
for
a
woman
to
call
impertinent
you
are
not
usually
so
severe
my
lord
i
am
not
usually
so
sincere
miss
beaufort
answered
he
but
i
see
you
think
for
yourself
therefore
i
make
no
hesitation
in
speaking
what
i
think
to
you
his
auditor
bowed
her
head
sportively
but
modestly
lady
dundas
at
that
moment
beckoned
him
across
the
room
she
compelled
him
to
sit
down
to
whist
he
cast
a
rueful
glance
at
mary
and
took
a
seat
opposite
to
his
costly
partner
lord
berrington
is
a
very
worthy
young
man
observed
the
clergyman
to
whom
at
the
beginning
of
the
evening
miss
beaufort
had
resigned
her
chair
i
presume
madam
you
have
been
honoring
him
with
your
conversation
yes
returned
mary
noticing
the
benign
countenance
of
the
speaker
i
have
not
had
the
pleasure
of
long
knowing
his
lordship
but
what
i
have
seen
of
his
character
is
highly
to
his
advantage
i
was
intimate
in
his
father
house
for
years
rejoined
the
gentleman
i
knew
this
young
nobleman
from
a
boy
if
he
has
faults
he
owes
them
to
his
mother
who
doated
on
him
and
rather
directed
his
care
to
the
adornment
of
his
really
handsome
person
than
to
the
cultivation
of
talents
he
has
since
learned
to
appreciate
i
believe
lord
berrington
to
be
very
sensible
and
above
all
very
humane
returned
miss
beaufort
he
is
so
replied
the
old
gentleman
yet
it
was
not
till
he
had
attained
the
age
of
that
he
appeared
to
know
he
had
anything
to
do
in
the
world
besides
dressing
and
attending
on
the
fair
sex
his
taste
produced
the
first
whilst
the
urbanity
of
his
disposition
gave
birth
to
the
latter
when
berrington
arrived
at
his
title
he
was
about
sorrow
for
the
death
of
his
amiable
parents
who
died
in
the
same
month
afforded
him
leisure
to
find
his
reason
he
discovered
that
he
had
been
acting
a
part
beneath
him
and
he
soon
implanted
on
the
good
old
stock
those
excellent
acquirements
which
you
see
he
possesses
in
spite
of
his
regeneration
continued
the
clergyman
casting
a
glance
on
the
suit
of
the
viscount
you
perceive
that
first
impressions
will
remain
he
loves
dress
but
he
loves
justice
and
philanthropy
better
this
eulogy
sir
said
mary
affords
me
real
pleasure
may
i
know
the
name
of
the
gentleman
with
whom
i
have
the
honor
to
converse
my
name
is
blackmore
returned
he
dr
blackmore
the
same
he
was
the
same
blackmore
who
had
been
struck
by
the
appearance
of
the
count
sobieski
at
the
hummums
but
had
never
learned
his
name
and
who
being
a
rare
visitor
at
lady
dundas
had
never
by
chance
met
a
second
time
with
the
object
of
his
compassion
i
am
happy
resumed
miss
beaufort
in
having
the
good
fortune
to
meet
a
clergyman
of
whom
i
have
so
frequently
heard
my
guardian
sir
robert
somerset
speak
with
the
highest
esteem
ah
replied
he
i
have
not
seen
him
since
the
death
of
his
lady
i
hope
that
he
and
his
son
are
well
both
are
perfectly
so
now
returned
she
and
are
together
in
the
country
you
madam
i
suppose
are
my
lady
niece
the
daughter
of
the
brave
admiral
beaufort
i
am
sir
well
i
rejoice
at
this
incident
rejoined
he
pressing
her
hand
i
knew
your
mother
when
she
was
a
lovely
girl
she
used
to
spend
her
summers
with
the
late
lady
somerset
at
the
castle
it
was
there
i
had
the
honor
of
cultivating
her
friendship
i
do
not
remember
ever
having
seen
my
mother
replied
the
now
thoughtful
mary
blackmore
observing
the
expression
of
her
countenance
smiled
kindly
and
said
i
fear
i
am
to
blame
here
this
is
a
somewhat
sad
way
of
introducing
myself
but
your
goodness
must
pardon
me
continued
he
for
i
have
so
long
accustomed
myself
to
speak
what
i
think
to
those
in
whom
i
see
cause
to
esteem
that
sometimes
as
now
i
undesignedly
inflict
pain
not
in
this
case
returned
miss
beaufort
i
am
always
pleased
when
listening
to
a
friend
of
my
mother
and
particularly
so
when
he
speaks
in
her
praise
the
breaking
up
of
the
prevented
further
conversation
lord
berrington
again
approached
the
sofa
where
mary
sat
exclaiming
as
he
perceived
her
companion
ah
my
good
doctor
have
you
presented
yourself
at
this
fair
shrine
i
declare
you
eccentric
folk
may
dare
anything
whilst
you
are
free
miss
beaufort
added
he
turning
to
her
adopt
the
advice
which
a
good
lady
once
gave
me
and
which
i
have
implicitly
followed
you
are
young
get
the
character
of
an
oddity
and
it
seats
you
in
an
easy
chair
for
life
mary
was
interrupted
in
her
reply
by
a
general
stir
amongst
the
company
who
now
the
cards
were
over
like
bees
and
wasps
were
swarming
about
the
room
gathering
honey
or
stinging
as
they
went
at
once
the
house
was
cleared
and
miss
beaufort
threw
herself
on
the
pillow
to
think
and
then
to
dream
of
thaddeus
chapter
xxxi
the
great
and
the
small
of
society
if
it
be
true
what
the
vivid
imaginations
of
poets
have
frequently
asserted
that
when
the
soul
dreams
it
is
in
the
actual
presence
of
those
beings
whose
images
present
themselves
to
their
slumbers
then
have
the
spirit
of
thaddeus
and
mary
been
often
commingled
at
the
hour
of
midnight
then
has
the
young
sobieski
again
visited
his
distant
country
again
seen
it
victorious
again
knelt
before
his
sainted
parents
from
such
visions
as
these
did
thaddeus
awake
in
the
morning
after
having
spent
the
preceding
evening
with
lady
tinemouth
he
had
walked
with
her
ladyship
in
hyde
park
till
a
late
hour
by
the
mild
light
of
the
moon
which
shone
brightly
through
the
still
balmy
air
of
a
midsummer
night
they
took
their
way
along
the
shadowy
bank
of
the
serpentine
there
is
a
solemn
appeal
to
the
soul
in
the
repose
of
nature
that
makes
itself
be
felt
no
syllable
from
either
thaddeus
or
the
countess
for
some
time
broke
the
universal
silence
thaddeus
looked
around
on
the
clear
expanse
of
water
by
the
long
reflection
of
the
darkening
trees
then
raising
his
eyes
to
that
beautiful
planet
which
has
excited
tender
thoughts
in
every
feeling
breast
since
the
creation
of
the
world
he
drew
a
deep
sigh
the
countess
echoed
it
illustration
lady
tinemouth
in
such
a
night
as
this
said
thaddeus
in
a
low
voice
as
if
afraid
to
disturb
the
sleeping
deity
of
the
place
i
used
to
walk
the
ramparts
of
villanow
with
my
dear
departed
mother
and
gaze
on
that
lovely
orb
and
when
i
was
far
from
her
i
have
looked
at
it
from
the
door
of
my
tent
and
fancying
that
her
eyes
were
then
fixed
on
the
same
object
as
mine
i
found
happiness
in
the
idea
a
tear
stole
down
the
cheek
of
thaddeus
that
moon
yet
shone
brightly
but
his
mother
eyes
were
closed
in
the
grave
villanow
repeated
the
countess
in
a
tone
of
tender
surprise
surely
that
was
the
seat
of
the
celebrated
palatine
of
masovia
you
have
discovered
yourself
constantine
i
am
much
mistaken
if
you
be
not
his
grandson
the
young
yet
thaddeus
sobieski
thaddeus
had
allowed
the
remembrances
pressing
on
his
mind
to
draw
him
into
a
speech
which
had
disclosed
to
the
quick
apprehension
of
the
countess
what
his
still
too
sensitive
pride
would
forever
have
concealed
i
have
indeed
betrayed
my
secret
cried
he
incapable
of
denying
it
but
dear
lady
tinemouth
as
you
value
my
feelings
never
let
it
escape
your
lips
having
long
considered
you
as
my
best
friend
and
loved
you
as
a
parent
i
forgot
in
the
recollection
of
my
beloved
mother
that
i
had
withheld
any
of
my
history
from
you
mysterious
providence
exclaimed
her
ladyship
after
a
pause
in
which
ten
thousand
admiring
and
pitying
reflections
thronged
on
her
mind
is
it
possible
can
it
be
the
count
sobieski
that
brave
and
illustrious
youth
of
whom
every
foreigner
spoke
with
wonder
can
it
be
him
that
i
behold
in
the
unknown
unfriended
constantine
even
so
returned
thaddeus
pressing
her
hand
my
country
is
no
more
i
am
now
forgotten
by
the
world
as
i
have
been
by
fortune
i
have
nothing
to
do
on
the
earth
but
to
fulfil
the
few
duties
which
a
filial
friendship
has
enjoined
and
then
it
will
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
how
soon
i
am
laid
in
its
bosom
you
are
too
young
dear
constantine
for
i
am
still
to
call
you
by
that
name
to
despair
of
happiness
being
yet
reserved
for
you
no
my
dear
lady
tinemouth
i
do
not
cheat
myself
with
such
hope
i
am
not
so
importunate
with
the
gracious
being
who
gave
me
life
and
reason
he
bestowed
upon
me
for
awhile
the
tenderest
connections
friends
rank
honors
glory
all
these
were
crushed
in
the
fall
of
poland
yet
i
survive
i
sought
resignation
only
and
i
have
found
it
it
cost
me
many
a
struggle
but
the
contest
was
due
to
the
decrees
of
that
creator
who
gave
my
first
years
to
happiness
inestimable
young
man
cried
the
countess
wiping
the
flowing
tears
from
her
eyes
you
teach
misfortune
dignity
not
when
all
warsaw
rose
in
a
body
to
thank
you
not
when
the
king
received
you
in
the
senate
with
open
arms
could
you
have
appeared
to
me
so
worthy
of
admiration
as
at
this
moment
when
conscious
of
having
been
all
this
you
submit
to
the
direct
reverse
because
you
believe
it
to
be
the
will
of
your
maker
ah
little
does
miss
beaufort
think
when
seated
by
your
side
that
she
is
conversing
with
the
youthful
hero
whom
she
has
so
often
wished
to
see
miss
beaufort
echoed
thaddeus
his
heart
glowing
with
delight
do
you
think
she
ever
heard
of
me
by
the
name
of
sobieski
who
has
not
returned
the
countess
every
heart
that
could
be
interested
by
heroic
virtue
has
heard
and
well
remembers
its
glorious
struggles
against
the
calamities
of
your
country
whilst
the
newspapers
of
the
day
informed
us
of
these
things
they
noticed
amongst
the
first
of
her
champions
the
palatine
of
masovia
kosciusko
and
the
young
sobieski
many
an
evening
have
i
passed
with
miss
dorothy
and
mary
beaufort
lamenting
the
fate
of
that
devoted
kingdom
during
this
declaration
a
variety
of
indeed
happy
emotions
agitated
the
mind
of
thaddeus
until
recollecting
with
a
bitter
pang
the
shameless
ingratitude
of
pembroke
when
all
those
glories
were
departed
from
him
and
the
cruel
possibility
of
being
recognized
by
the
earl
of
tinemouth
as
his
son
he
exclaimed
my
dearest
madam
i
entreat
that
what
i
have
revealed
to
you
may
never
be
divulged
miss
beaufort
friendship
would
indeed
be
happiness
but
i
can
not
purchase
even
so
great
a
bliss
at
the
expense
of
memories
which
are
knit
with
my
life
how
cried
the
countess
is
not
your
name
and
all
its
attendant
ideas
an
honor
which
the
proudest
man
might
boast
thaddeus
pressed
her
hand
to
his
heart
you
are
kind
very
kind
yet
i
can
not
retract
confide
dear
lady
tinemouth
in
the
justice
of
my
resolution
i
could
not
bear
cold
pity
i
could
not
bear
the
heartless
comments
of
people
who
pretending
to
compassion
would
load
me
with
a
heavy
sense
of
my
calamities
besides
there
are
persons
in
england
who
are
so
much
the
objects
of
my
aversion
i
would
rather
die
than
let
them
know
i
exist
therefore
once
again
dear
lady
tinemouth
let
me
implore
you
to
preserve
my
secret
she
saw
by
the
earnestness
of
his
manner
that
she
ought
to
comply
and
without
further
hesitation
promised
all
the
silence
he
desired
this
long
moonlight
conversation
by
awakening
all
those
dormant
remembrances
which
were
cherished
though
hidden
in
the
depths
of
his
bosom
gave
birth
to
that
of
imagination
which
painted
that
night
in
the
rapid
series
of
his
tumultuous
dreams
the
images
of
every
being
whom
he
had
ever
loved
or
now
continued
to
regard
with
interest
proceeding
next
morning
towards
harley
street
he
mused
on
what
had
happened
and
pleased
that
he
had
though
unpremeditatedly
paid
the
just
compliment
of
his
entire
confidence
to
the
uncommon
friendship
of
the
countess
he
arrived
at
lady
dundas
door
before
he
was
sensible
of
the
ground
he
had
passed
over
and
in
a
few
minutes
afterwards
was
ushered
into
his
accustomed
purgatory
when
the
servant
opened
the
miss
euphemia
was
again
alone
thaddeus
recoiled
but
he
could
not
retreat
come
in
constantine
cried
the
little
beauty
in
a
languid
tone
my
sister
is
going
to
the
with
lascelles
miss
beaufort
wanted
me
to
drive
out
with
her
and
my
mother
but
i
preferred
waiting
for
you
the
count
bowed
and
almost
retreating
with
fear
of
what
might
next
be
said
he
gladly
heard
a
thundering
knock
at
the
door
and
a
moment
after
the
voice
of
miss
dundas
ascending
the
stairs
he
had
just
opened
his
books
when
she
entered
followed
by
her
lover
panting
under
a
heavy
she
flung
herself
on
a
sofa
and
began
to
vilify
the
odious
heat
of
pozard
odious
place
then
telling
euphemia
she
would
play
truant
ordered
her
to
attend
to
her
lessons
owing
to
the
warmth
of
the
weather
thaddeus
came
out
this
morning
without
boots
and
it
being
the
first
time
the
exquisite
proportion
of
his
figure
had
been
so
fully
seen
by
any
of
the
present
company
excepting
euphemia
lascelles
bursting
with
an
emotion
which
he
would
not
call
envy
measured
the
count
graceful
limb
with
his
scornful
eyes
then
declaring
he
was
quite
in
a
furnace
took
the
corner
of
his
glove
and
waving
it
to
and
fro
come
gentle
air
the
fairer
lascelles
cries
exclaimed
euphemia
looking
off
her
exercise
what
does
your
master
teach
you
wit
drawled
the
coxcomb
with
a
particular
emphasis
thaddeus
affecting
not
to
hear
continued
to
direct
his
pupil
the
indefatigable
lascelles
having
observed
the
complacence
with
which
the
count
always
regarded
miss
beaufort
determined
the
goad
should
fret
and
drawing
the
knitting
out
of
his
pocket
which
he
had
snatched
the
night
before
from
mary
he
exclaimed
heaven
here
is
my
little
beaufort
purse
thaddeus
started
and
unconsciously
looking
up
beheld
the
work
of
mary
dangling
in
the
hand
of
lascelles
he
suffered
pangs
unknown
to
him
his
eyes
became
dim
and
hardly
knowing
what
he
saw
or
said
he
pursued
the
lesson
with
increased
rapidity
finding
that
his
malice
had
taken
effect
with
a
careless
air
the
malicious
puppy
threw
his
clumsy
limbs
on
the
sofa
which
miss
dundas
had
just
quitted
to
seat
herself
nearer
the
window
and
cried
out
as
in
a
voice
of
sudden
recollection
by
the
bye
that
miss
mary
beaufort
when
she
chooses
to
be
sincere
is
a
staunch
little
queen
bess
you
may
as
well
tell
me
replied
miss
dundas
with
a
deriding
curl
of
her
lip
that
she
is
the
empress
of
russia
i
beg
your
pardon
cried
he
and
raising
his
voice
to
be
better
heard
i
do
not
mean
in
the
way
of
learning
but
i
will
prove
in
a
moment
her
creditable
in
these
presumptuous
times
though
a
silly
love
of
popularity
induces
her
to
affect
now
and
then
a
humble
guise
to
some
people
beneath
her
when
she
gave
me
this
gewgaw
added
he
flourishing
the
purse
in
his
hand
she
told
me
a
pretty
tissue
about
a
fair
friend
of
hers
whose
mistaking
some
condescension
on
her
part
had
dared
to
press
her
snowy
fingers
while
directing
them
towards
a
tender
chord
on
her
harp
you
have
no
notion
how
the
gentle
beaufort
blue
eyes
blazed
up
while
relating
poor
tweedledum
presumption
i
can
have
a
notion
of
anything
these
boasted
meek
young
ladies
do
when
thrown
off
their
guard
haughtily
returned
his
contemptuous
auditress
after
miss
beaufort
violent
sally
of
impertinence
to
you
last
night
impertinence
to
me
echoed
the
fop
at
the
same
time
dipping
the
end
of
the
knitting
into
diana
and
dabbing
his
temples
she
was
always
too
civil
by
half
i
hate
forward
girls
thaddeus
shut
the
large
dictionary
which
lay
before
him
with
a
force
that
made
the
puppy
start
and
rising
hastily
from
his
chair
with
a
face
all
crimson
was
taking
his
hat
when
the
door
opened
and
mary
appeared
a
bonnet
was
resting
lightly
on
the
glittering
tresses
which
waved
over
her
forehead
whilst
her
gently
discomposed
by
the
air
half
veiled
and
half
revealed
her
graceful
figure
she
entered
with
a
smile
and
walking
up
to
the
side
of
the
table
where
thaddeus
was
standing
inquired
after
his
health
he
answered
her
in
a
voice
unusually
agitated
all
that
he
had
been
told
by
the
countess
of
her
favorable
opinion
of
him
and
the
slander
he
had
just
heard
from
diana
lover
were
at
once
present
in
his
mind
he
was
yet
speaking
when
miss
beaufort
casually
looking
towards
the
other
side
of
the
room
saw
her
purse
still
acting
the
part
of
a
handkerchief
in
the
hand
of
lascelles
look
constantine
said
she
gayly
tapping
his
arm
with
her
parasol
how
the
most
precious
things
may
be
degraded
there
is
the
knitting
you
have
so
often
admired
and
which
i
intended
for
lady
tinemouth
pocket
debased
to
do
the
office
of
napkin
you
gave
it
to
him
miss
beaufort
cried
miss
dundas
and
after
that
surely
he
may
use
it
as
he
values
it
if
i
could
have
given
it
to
lascelles
madam
i
should
hardly
have
taken
notice
of
its
fate
believing
what
her
lover
had
advanced
miss
dundas
was
displeased
at
mary
for
having
by
presents
interfered
with
any
of
her
danglers
and
rather
angrily
replied
lascelles
said
you
gave
it
to
him
and
certainly
you
would
not
insinuate
a
word
against
his
veracity
no
not
insinuate
returned
miss
beaufort
but
affirm
that
he
has
forgotten
his
veracity
in
this
statement
lascelles
yawned
lord
bless
me
ladies
how
you
quarrel
you
will
disturb
monsieur
constantine
returned
mary
blushing
with
indignation
can
not
be
disturbed
by
nonsense
thaddeus
again
drew
his
hat
towards
him
and
bowing
to
his
lovely
champion
with
an
expression
of
countenance
which
he
little
suspected
had
passed
from
his
heart
to
his
eyes
he
was
preparing
to
take
his
leave
when
euphemia
requested
him
to
inform
her
whether
she
had
folded
down
the
right
pages
for
the
next
exercise
he
approached
her
and
was
leaning
over
her
chair
to
look
at
the
book
when
she
whispered
do
be
hurt
at
what
lascelles
says
he
is
always
jealous
of
anybody
who
is
handsomer
than
himself
thaddeus
dropped
his
eyelids
with
a
face
of
scarlet
for
on
meeting
the
eyes
of
mary
he
saw
that
she
had
heard
this
intended
comforter
as
well
as
himself
uttering
a
few
incoherent
sentences
to
both
ladies
he
hurried
out
of
the
room

of
vice
the
inhumanity
of
folly
the
count
sobieski
was
prevented
paying
his
customary
visit
next
morning
in
harley
street
by
a
sudden
dangerous
increase
of
illness
in
the
general
who
had
been
struck
at
seven
by
a
fit
of
palsy
when
cavendish
beheld
the
poor
old
man
stretched
on
the
bed
and
hardly
exhibiting
signs
of
life
he
pronounced
it
to
be
a
stroke
at
this
remark
thaddeus
turning
fearfully
pale
staggered
to
a
seat
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
altered
features
of
his
friend
cavendish
took
his
hand
recollect
yourself
my
dear
sir
happen
when
it
may
his
death
must
be
a
release
to
him
but
he
may
yet
linger
a
few
days
not
in
pain
i
hope
said
thaddeus
no
returned
the
doctor
probably
he
will
remain
as
you
now
see
him
till
he
expires
like
the
last
glimmer
of
a
dying
taper
the
benevolent
cavendish
gave
proper
directions
to
thaddeus
also
to
robson
who
promised
to
act
carefully
as
nurse
and
then
with
regret
left
the
stunned
count
to
the
melancholy
task
of
watching
by
the
bedside
of
his
last
early
friend
thaddeus
now
retained
no
thought
that
was
not
riveted
to
the
emaciated
form
before
him
whilst
the
unconscious
invalid
struggled
for
respiration
he
listened
to
his
short
and
convulsed
breathing
with
sensations
which
seemed
to
tear
the
strings
of
his
own
breast
unable
to
bear
it
longer
he
moved
to
the
fireside
and
seating
himself
with
his
pallid
face
and
aching
head
supported
on
his
arm
which
rested
on
a
plain
deal
table
he
remained
meeting
no
other
suspension
from
deep
and
awestruck
meditation
than
the
occasional
appearance
of
robson
on
tiptoes
peeping
in
and
inquiring
whether
he
wanted
anything
from
this
reverie
like
unto
the
shadow
of
death
he
was
aroused
next
morning
at
nine
by
the
entrance
of
cavendish
thaddeus
seized
his
hand
with
the
eagerness
of
his
awakened
suspense
my
dear
sir
may
i
hope
not
suffering
him
to
finish
with
what
he
hoped
the
doctor
shook
his
head
in
gentle
sign
of
the
vanity
of
that
hope
and
advanced
to
the
bed
of
the
general
he
felt
his
pulse
no
change
of
opinion
was
the
consequence
only
that
he
now
saw
no
threatenings
of
immediate
dissolution
poor
butzou
murmured
thaddeus
when
the
doctor
withdrew
putting
the
general
motionless
hand
to
his
quivering
lips
i
never
will
leave
thee
i
will
watch
by
thee
thou
last
relic
of
my
country
it
may
not
be
long
ere
we
lie
side
by
side
with
anguish
at
his
heart
he
wrote
a
few
hasty
lines
to
the
countess
then
addressing
miss
dundas
he
mentioned
as
the
reason
for
his
late
and
continued
absence
the
danger
of
his
friend
his
note
found
miss
dundas
attended
by
her
constant
shadow
lascelles
lady
hilliars
and
two
or
three
more
fine
ladies
and
gentlemen
besides
euphemia
and
miss
beaufort
who
with
pensive
countenances
were
waiting
the
arrival
of
its
writer
when
miss
dundas
took
the
billet
off
the
silver
salver
on
which
her
man
presented
it
and
looked
at
the
superscription
she
threw
it
into
the
lap
of
lacelles
there
cried
she
is
an
excuse
i
suppose
from
constantine
for
his
impertinence
in
not
coming
hither
yesterday
read
it
lascelles
gad
i
would
touch
it
for
an
earldom
exclaimed
the
affected
puppy
jerking
it
on
the
table
it
might
affect
me
with
the
hypochondriacs
pray
phemy
do
you
peruse
it
euphemia
in
her
earnestness
to
learn
what
detained
constantine
neglected
the
insolence
of
the
request
and
hastily
breaking
the
seal
read
as
follows
constantine
hopes
that
a
sudden
and
dangerous
disorder
which
has
attacked
the
life
of
a
very
dear
friend
with
whom
he
resides
will
be
a
sufficient
appeal
to
the
humanity
of
the
misses
dundas
and
obtain
their
pardon
for
his
relinquishing
the
honor
of
attending
them
yesterday
and
dear
me
cried
euphemia
piteously
how
sorry
i
am
i
dare
say
it
is
that
old
man
we
saw
in
the
park
you
remember
mary
he
was
sick
probably
returned
miss
beaufort
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
agitated
handwriting
of
thaddeus
throw
the
letter
into
the
street
phemy
cried
miss
dundas
affecting
sudden
terror
who
knows
but
what
it
is
a
fever
the
man
has
got
and
we
may
all
catch
our
deaths
heaven
forbid
exclaimed
mary
in
a
voice
of
real
alarm
but
it
was
for
thaddeus
not
fear
of
any
infection
which
the
paper
might
bring
to
herself
lascelles
take
away
that
filthy
scrawl
from
phemy
how
can
you
be
so
headstrong
child
cried
diana
snatching
the
letter
from
her
sister
and
throwing
it
from
the
window
i
declare
you
are
sufficient
to
provoke
a
saint
then
you
may
keep
your
temper
di
returned
euphemia
with
a
sneer
you
are
far
enough
from
that
title
miss
dundas
made
a
very
angry
reply
which
was
retaliated
by
another
and
a
still
more
noisy
and
disagreeable
altercation
might
have
taken
place
had
not
a
lad
a
of
lady
hilliars
in
hopes
of
calling
off
the
attention
of
the
sisters
exclaimed
bless
me
miss
dundas
your
little
dog
has
pulled
a
folded
sheet
of
paper
from
under
that
stand
of
flowers
perhaps
it
may
be
of
consequence
fly
take
it
up
george
cried
lady
hilliars
esop
will
tear
it
to
atoms
whilst
you
are
asking
questions
after
a
chase
round
the
room
over
chairs
and
under
tables
george
hilliars
at
length
plucked
the
devoted
piece
of
paper
out
of
the
dog
mouth
and
as
miss
beaufort
was
gathering
up
her
working
materials
to
leave
the
room
he
opened
it
and
cried
in
a
voice
of
triumph
by
jove
it
is
a
copy
of
verses
verses
demanded
euphemia
feeling
in
her
pocket
and
coloring
let
me
see
them
that
you
roared
lascelles
catching
them
out
of
the
hand
if
they
are
your
writing
we
will
have
them
help
me
mary
cried
euphemia
turning
to
miss
beaufort
i
know
that
nobody
is
a
poet
in
this
house
but
myself
they
must
be
mine
and
i
will
have
them
surely
lascelles
said
mary
compassionating
the
poor
anxiety
you
will
not
be
so
rude
as
to
detain
them
from
their
right
owner
oh
but
i
will
cried
he
mounting
on
a
table
to
get
out
of
euphemia
reach
who
half
crying
tried
to
snatch
at
the
paper
let
me
alone
miss
phemy
i
will
read
them
so
here
goes
it
miss
dundas
laughed
at
her
sister
confused
looks
whilst
lascelles
prepared
to
read
in
a
loud
voice
the
following
verses
they
had
been
hastily
written
in
pencil
by
thaddeus
a
long
time
ago
and
having
put
them
by
mistake
with
some
other
papers
into
his
pocket
he
had
dropped
them
next
day
in
taking
out
his
handkerchief
at
lady
dundas
lascelles
cleared
his
throat
with
three
hems
then
raising
his
right
hand
with
a
flourishing
action
in
a
very
pompous
tone
began
like
one
whom
etna
torrent
fires
have
sent
far
from
the
land
where
his
first
youth
was
spent
who
inly
drooping
on
a
foreign
shore
broods
over
scenes
which
charm
his
eyes
no
more
and
while
his
country
ruin
wakes
the
groan
yearns
for
the
buried
hut
he
called
his
own
so
o
poland
from
thy
ravaged
plains
so
mourning
thy
sad
and
but
loved
remains
a
houseless
wretch
i
wander
through
the
world
from
friends
from
greatness
and
from
glory
hurl
oh
not
that
each
long
night
my
weary
eyes
sink
into
sleep
unlull
by
pity
sighs
not
that
in
bitter
tears
my
bread
is
steep
tears
drawn
by
insults
on
my
sorrows
heap
not
that
my
thoughts
recall
a
mother
grave
recall
the
sire
i
would
have
died
to
save
who
fell
before
me
bleeding
on
the
field
whilst
i
in
vain
opposed
the
useless
shield
ah
not
for
these
i
grieve
though
mental
woe
more
deadly
still
scarce
fancy
self
could
know
want
and
private
griefs
the
soul
can
climb
virtue
subdues
the
one
the
other
time
but
at
his
country
fall
the
patriot
feels
a
grief
no
time
no
drug
no
reason
heals
remorseless
murderer
whose
voice
kills
as
it
sounds
who
never
says
rejoice
to
my
deserted
heart
by
joy
forgot
thou
pale
thou
midnight
spectre
haunt
me
not
thou
dost
but
point
to
where
sublimely
stands
a
glorious
temple
reared
by
virtue
hands
circled
with
palms
and
laurels
crown
with
light
darting
truth
piercing
sun
on
mortal
sight
then
rushing
on
leagued
fiends
of
hellish
birth
level
the
mighty
fabric
with
the
earth
slept
the
red
bolt
of
vengeance
in
that
hour
when
virtuous
freedom
fell
the
slave
of
power
slumber
the
god
of
justice
that
no
brand
blasted
with
blazing
wing
the
impious
band
dread
god
of
justice
to
thy
will
i
kneel
though
still
my
filial
heart
must
bleed
and
feel
though
still
the
proud
convulsive
throb
will
rise
when
fools
my
country
wrongs
and
woes
despise
when
pomp
vain
wealth
that
pity
gives
which
virtue
bestows
and
receives
that
pity
stabbing
where
it
vaunts
to
cure
which
barbs
the
dart
of
want
and
makes
it
sure
how
far
removed
from
what
the
feeling
breast
yields
boastless
breathed
in
sighs
to
the
distress
which
whispers
sympathy
with
tender
fear
and
almost
dreads
to
pour
its
balmy
tear
but
such
i
know
not
now
unseen
alone
i
heave
the
heavy
sigh
i
draw
the
groan
and
turn
to
days
of
liveliest
joy
when
my
native
hills
i
cast
mine
eyes
and
said
exulting
freemen
here
shall
sow
the
seed
that
soon
in
tossing
gold
shall
glow
while
plenty
led
by
liberty
shall
rove
gay
and
rejoicing
through
the
land
they
love
and
the
loaded
vines
the
peasant
see
his
wife
his
children
breathing
out
free
but
now
o
wretched
land
above
thy
plains
half
viewless
through
the
gloom
vast
horror
reigns
no
happy
peasant
his
blazing
hearth
devotes
the
supper
hour
to
love
and
mirth
no
flowers
on
piety
pure
altar
bloom
alas
they
wither
now
and
strew
her
tomb
from
the
great
book
of
nations
fiercely
rent
my
country
page
to
lethe
stream
is
sent
but
sent
in
vain
the
historic
muse
shall
raise
wronged
sarmatia
cause
the
voice
of
praise
shall
sing
her
dauntless
on
the
field
of
death
and
blast
her
royal
robbers
bloody
wrath
it
must
be
constantine
cried
euphemia
in
a
voice
of
surprised
delight
while
springing
up
to
take
the
paper
out
of
the
deriding
reader
hand
when
he
finished
i
dare
say
it
is
answered
the
lascelles
holding
it
above
his
head
you
shall
have
it
only
first
let
us
hear
it
again
it
is
so
mighty
pretty
so
very
lackadaisical
give
it
to
me
cried
euphemia
quite
angry
do
lascelles
exclaimed
miss
dundas
the
man
must
be
a
perfect
idiot
to
write
such
rhodomontade
o
it
is
delectable
returned
her
lover
opening
the
paper
again
it
would
make
a
charming
ditty
come
i
will
sing
it
shall
it
be
to
the
tune
of
babes
in
the
wood
or
chase
or
beggar
of
bethnal
green
pitiless
senseless
man
exclaimed
mary
rising
from
her
chair
where
she
had
been
striving
to
subdue
the
emotions
with
which
every
line
in
the
poem
filled
her
heart
monster
cried
the
enraged
euphemia
taking
courage
at
miss
beaufort
unusual
warmth
i
will
have
the
paper
you
answered
the
malicious
coxcomb
and
raising
his
arm
higher
than
her
reach
he
tore
it
in
a
hundred
pieces
i
teach
pretty
ladies
to
call
names
at
this
sight
no
longer
able
to
contain
herself
mary
rushed
out
of
the
room
and
hurrying
to
her
chamber
threw
herself
upon
the
bed
where
she
gave
way
to
a
paroxysm
of
tears
which
shook
her
almost
to
suffocation
during
the
first
burst
of
her
indignation
her
agitated
spirit
breathed
every
appellation
of
abhorrence
and
reproach
on
lascelles
and
his
malignant
mistress
then
wiping
her
flowing
eyes
she
exclaimed
yet
can
i
wonder
when
i
compare
constantine
with
what
they
are
the
man
who
dares
to
be
virtuous
beyond
others
and
to
appear
so
arms
the
of
all
common
characters
against
him
such
being
her
meditations
she
excused
herself
from
joining
the
family
at
dinner
and
it
was
not
until
evening
that
she
felt
herself
at
all
able
to
treat
the
group
with
decent
civility
to
avoid
spending
more
hours
than
were
absolutely
necessary
in
the
company
of
a
woman
she
now
loathed
next
morning
miss
beaufort
borrowed
lady
dundas
and
ordering
it
to
lady
tinemouth
found
her
at
home
alone
but
evidently
much
discomposed
i
intrude
on
you
lady
tinemouth
said
mary
observing
her
looks
and
withdrawing
from
the
offered
seat
no
my
dear
miss
beaufort
replied
she
i
am
glad
you
are
come
i
assure
you
i
have
few
pleasures
in
solitude
read
that
letter
added
she
putting
one
into
her
hand
it
has
just
conveyed
one
of
the
cruelest
stabs
ever
offered
by
a
son
to
the
heart
of
his
mother
read
it
and
you
will
not
be
surprised
at
finding
me
in
the
state
you
see
the
countess
looked
on
her
almost
paralyzed
hands
as
she
spoke
and
miss
beaufort
taking
the
paper
sat
down
and
read
to
herself
the
following
letter
to
the
right
honorable
the
countess
of
tinemouth
madam
i
am
commissioned
by
the
earl
my
father
to
inform
you
that
if
you
have
lost
all
regard
for
your
own
character
he
considers
that
some
respect
is
due
to
the
mother
of
his
children
therefore
he
watches
your
conduct
he
has
been
apprized
of
your
frequent
meetings
during
these
many
months
past
in
grosvenor
place
and
at
other
people
houses
with
an
obscure
foreigner
your
declared
lover
the
earl
wished
to
suppose
this
false
until
your
shameless
behavior
became
so
flagrant
that
he
esteems
it
worthy
neither
of
doubt
nor
indulgence
with
his
own
eyes
he
saw
you
four
nights
ago
alone
with
this
man
in
hyde
park
such
demonstration
is
dreadful
your
proceedings
are
abominable
and
if
you
do
not
without
further
parley
set
off
either
to
craighall
in
cornwall
or
to
the
wolds
you
shall
receive
a
letter
from
my
sister
as
well
as
myself
to
tell
the
dishonored
lady
tinemouth
how
much
she
merits
her
daughter
contempt
added
to
that
of
her
brother
harwold
mary
was
indeed
at
the
contents
of
this
letter
but
most
especially
at
the
accusation
which
so
distinctly
pointed
out
the
innocent
object
of
her
already
pity
oh
why
these
persecutions
cried
her
inward
soul
to
heaven
against
an
apparently
obscure
but
noble
friendless
stranger
unable
to
collect
her
thoughts
to
make
any
proper
remarks
whatever
on
the
letter
to
lady
tinemouth
she
hastily
exclaimed
it
is
indeed
horrible
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
my
honored
friend
i
will
obey
my
lord
returned
the
countess
with
a
meek
but
firm
emphasis
my
last
action
will
be
in
obedience
to
his
will
i
can
not
live
long
and
when
i
am
dead
perhaps
the
earl
vigilance
may
be
satisfied
perhaps
some
kind
friend
may
then
plead
my
cause
to
my
daughter
heart
one
cruel
line
from
her
would
kill
me
i
will
at
least
avoid
the
completion
of
that
threat
by
leaving
town
night
what
so
soon
but
i
hope
not
so
far
as
cornwall
no
replied
her
ladyship
craighall
is
too
near
plymouth
i
determine
on
the
wolds
yet
why
should
i
have
a
choice
it
is
almost
a
matter
of
indifference
to
what
spot
i
am
banished
in
what
place
i
am
to
die
anywhere
to
which
my
earthly
lord
would
send
me
i
shall
be
equally
remote
from
the
sympathy
of
a
friend
miss
beaufort
heart
was
oppressed
when
she
entered
the
room
lady
tinemouth
sorrows
seemed
to
give
her
a
license
to
weep
she
took
her
ladyship
hand
and
with
difficulty
sobbed
out
this
inarticulate
proposal
take
me
with
you
dear
lady
tinemouth
i
am
sure
my
guardian
will
be
happy
to
permit
me
to
be
with
you
where
and
how
long
you
please
my
dear
young
friend
replied
the
countess
kissing
her
tearful
cheek
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
but
i
can
not
take
so
ungenerous
an
advantage
of
your
goodness
as
to
consign
your
tender
nature
to
the
harassing
task
of
attending
on
sorrow
and
sickness
how
strangely
different
may
even
amiable
dispositions
be
tempered
sophia
egerton
is
better
framed
for
such
an
office
kind
as
she
is
the
hilarity
of
her
disposition
does
nor
allow
the
sympathy
she
bestows
on
others
to
injure
either
her
mind
or
her
body
mary
interrupted
her
ah
i
should
be
grieved
to
believe
that
my
very
aptitude
to
serve
my
friends
will
prove
the
first
reason
why
i
should
be
denied
the
duty
it
is
only
in
scenes
of
affliction
that
friendship
can
be
tried
and
declare
its
truth
if
miss
egerton
were
not
going
with
you
i
should
certainly
insist
on
putting
my
affection
to
the
ordeal
you
mistake
my
sweet
friend
returned
her
ladyship
sophia
is
forbidden
to
remain
any
longer
with
me
you
have
overlooked
the
postscript
to
lord
harwold
letter
else
you
must
have
seen
the
whole
of
my
cruel
situation
turn
over
the
leaf
miss
beaufort
the
sheet
and
read
the
following
few
lines
which
being
written
on
the
interior
part
of
the
paper
had
before
escaped
her
sight
go
where
you
will
it
is
our
special
injunction
that
you
leave
miss
egerton
behind
you
she
we
hear
has
been
the
ambassadress
in
this
intrigue
if
we
learn
that
you
disobey
it
shall
be
worse
for
you
in
every
respect
as
it
will
convince
us
beyond
a
possibility
of
doubt
how
uniform
is
the
turpitude
of
your
conduct
lady
tinemouth
grasped
miss
beaufort
hand
when
she
laid
the
matricidal
letter
back
upon
the
table
and
that
is
from
the
son
for
whom
i
felt
all
a
mother
throes
all
a
mother
love
had
he
died
the
first
hour
in
which
he
saw
the
light
what
a
mass
of
guilt
might
he
not
have
escaped
it
is
he
added
she
in
a
lower
voice
and
looking
wildly
round
that
breaks
my
heart
i
could
have
borne
his
father
perfidy
but
insult
oppression
from
my
child
oh
mary
may
you
never
know
its
bitterness
miss
beaufort
could
only
answer
with
her
tears
after
a
pause
of
many
minutes
in
which
the
countess
strove
to
tranquillize
her
spirits
she
resumed
in
a
more
composed
voice
excuse
me
for
an
instant
my
dear
miss
beaufort
i
must
write
to
constantine
i
have
yet
to
inform
him
that
my
absence
is
to
be
added
to
his
other
misfortunes
with
her
eyes
now
raining
down
upon
the
paper
she
took
up
a
pen
and
hastily
writing
a
few
lines
was
sealing
them
when
mary
looking
up
hardly
conscious
of
the
words
which
escaped
her
said
with
inarticulate
anxiety
lady
tinemouth
you
know
much
of
that
noble
and
unhappy
young
man
her
eyes
irresolute
and
her
cheek
glowing
she
awaited
the
answer
of
the
countess
who
continued
to
gaze
on
the
letter
she
held
in
her
hand
as
if
in
profound
thought
then
all
at
once
raising
her
head
and
regarding
the
now
downcast
face
of
her
lovely
friend
with
tenderness
she
replied
in
a
tone
which
conveyed
the
deep
interest
of
her
thoughts
i
do
miss
beaufort
but
he
has
reposed
his
griefs
in
my
friendship
and
honor
therefore
i
must
hold
them
sacred
i
will
not
ask
you
to
betray
them
returned
mary
in
a
faltering
voice
yet
i
can
not
help
lamenting
his
sufferings
and
i
esteeming
the
fortitude
with
which
he
supports
his
fall
the
countess
looked
steadfastly
on
her
fluctuating
countenance
has
constantine
my
dear
girl
hinted
to
you
that
he
ever
was
otherwise
than
as
he
now
appears
miss
beaufort
could
not
reply
she
would
not
trust
her
lips
with
words
but
shook
her
head
in
sign
that
he
had
not
lady
tinemouth
was
too
well
read
in
the
human
heart
to
doubt
for
an
instant
the
cause
of
her
question
and
consequent
emotion
feeling
that
something
was
due
to
an
anxiety
so
disinterested
she
took
her
passive
hand
and
said
mary
you
have
guessed
rightly
though
i
am
not
authorized
to
tell
you
the
real
name
of
constantine
nor
the
particulars
of
his
history
yet
let
this
satisfy
your
generous
heart
that
it
can
never
be
more
honorably
employed
than
in
compassionating
calamities
which
ought
to
wreath
his
young
brows
with
glory
miss
beaufort
eyes
streamed
afresh
whilst
her
exulting
soul
seemed
ready
to
rush
from
her
bosom
mary
continued
the
countess
wanned
by
the
recollection
of
his
excellence
you
have
no
need
to
blush
at
the
interest
which
you
take
in
this
amiable
stranger
every
trial
of
spirit
which
could
have
tortured
youth
or
manhood
has
been
endured
by
him
with
the
firmness
of
a
hero
ah
my
sweet
friend
added
the
countess
pressing
the
hand
of
the
confused
miss
beaufort
who
ashamed
and
conscious
that
her
behavior
betrayed
how
dearly
she
considered
him
had
covered
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
when
you
are
disposed
to
believe
that
a
man
is
as
great
as
his
titles
and
personal
demands
seem
to
assert
examine
with
a
nice
observance
whether
his
pretensions
be
real
or
artificial
imagine
him
disrobed
of
splendor
and
struggling
with
the
world
inclemencies
if
his
character
can
not
stand
this
ordeal
he
is
only
a
vain
pageant
inflated
and
garnished
and
it
is
reasonable
to
punish
such
arrogance
with
contempt
but
on
the
contrary
when
like
constantine
he
rises
from
the
ashes
of
his
fortunes
in
a
brighter
blaze
of
virtue
then
dearest
girl
cried
the
countess
encircling
her
with
her
arms
it
is
the
sweetest
privilege
of
loveliness
to
console
and
bless
so
rare
a
being
mary
raised
her
weeping
face
from
the
bosom
of
her
friend
and
clasping
her
hands
together
with
trepidation
and
anguish
implored
her
to
be
as
faithful
to
her
secret
as
she
had
proved
herself
to
constantine
i
would
sooner
die
added
she
than
have
him
know
my
rashness
perhaps
my
indelicacy
let
me
possess
his
esteem
lady
tinemouth
let
him
suppose
that
i
only
him
more
i
should
shrink
from
i
have
seen
him
beset
by
some
of
my
sex
and
to
be
classed
with
them
to
have
him
imagine
that
my
affection
is
like
theirs
i
could
not
bear
it
i
entreat
you
let
him
respect
me
the
impetuosity
and
almost
despair
with
which
miss
beaufort
uttered
these
incoherent
sentences
penetrated
the
soul
of
lady
tinemouth
with
admiration
how
different
was
the
spirit
of
this
pure
and
dignified
love
to
the
wild
passion
she
had
seen
shake
the
frame
of
lady
sara
ross
they
remained
silent
for
some
time
may
i
see
your
ladyship
asked
mary
drawing
her
cloak
about
her
i
fear
not
replied
the
countess
i
leave
this
house
tomorrow
morning
miss
beaufort
rose
her
lips
hands
and
feet
trembled
so
that
she
could
hardly
stand
lady
tinemouth
put
her
arm
round
her
waist
and
kissing
her
forehead
added
heaven
bless
you
my
sweet
friend
may
all
the
wishes
of
your
innocent
heart
be
gratified
the
countess
supported
her
to
the
door
mary
hesitated
an
instant
then
flinging
her
snowy
arms
over
her
ladyship
neck
in
a
voice
scarcely
audible
articulated
only
tell
me
does
he
love
euphemia
lady
tinemouth
strained
her
to
her
breast
no
my
dearest
girl
i
am
certain
both
from
what
i
have
heard
him
say
and
observed
in
his
eyes
that
did
he
dare
to
love
any
one
would
be
the
object
of
his
choice
how
miss
beaufort
got
into
lady
dundas
she
had
no
recollection
so
completely
was
she
absorbed
in
the
recent
scene
her
mind
was
perplexed
her
heart
ached
and
she
arrived
in
harley
street
so
much
disordered
and
unwell
as
to
oblige
her
to
retire
immediately
to
her
room
with
the
excuse
of
a
violent
pain
in
her
head
chapter
xxxiii
passion
and
principle
this
interview
induced
lady
tinemouth
to
destroy
the
note
she
had
written
to
thaddeus
and
to
frame
another
better
calculated
to
produce
comfort
to
all
parties
what
she
had
declared
to
mary
respecting
the
state
of
the
count
affections
was
sincere
she
had
early
pierced
the
veil
of
bashfulness
with
which
miss
beaufort
overshadowed
when
in
his
presence
that
countenance
so
usually
the
tablet
of
her
soul
the
countess
easily
translated
the
quick
receding
of
her
eye
whenever
thaddeus
turned
his
attention
towards
her
the
confused
reply
that
followed
any
unexpected
question
from
his
lips
and
above
all
the
unheeded
sighs
heaved
by
her
when
he
left
the
room
or
when
his
name
was
mentioned
during
his
absence
these
symptoms
too
truly
revealed
to
lady
tinemouth
the
state
of
her
young
friend
bosom
but
the
circumstances
being
different
her
observations
on
thaddeus
were
not
nearly
so
conclusive
mary
had
absolutely
given
the
empire
of
her
happiness
with
her
heart
into
his
hands
thaddeus
felt
that
his
ruined
hopes
ought
to
prevent
him
laying
his
at
her
feet
could
he
even
be
made
to
believe
that
he
had
found
any
favor
in
her
sight
and
regarding
her
as
a
being
beyond
his
reach
he
conceived
no
suspicions
that
she
entertained
one
dearer
thought
of
him
than
what
mere
philanthropy
could
authorize
he
contemplated
her
unequalled
beauty
graces
talents
and
virtues
with
an
admiration
bordering
on
idolatry
yet
his
heart
flew
from
the
confession
that
he
loved
her
and
it
was
not
until
reason
demanded
of
his
sincerity
why
he
felt
a
pang
on
seeing
mary
purse
in
the
hands
of
lascelles
that
with
a
glowing
cheek
he
owned
to
himself
that
he
was
jealous
that
although
he
had
not
presumed
to
elevate
one
wish
towards
the
possession
of
miss
beaufort
yet
when
lascelles
flaunted
her
name
on
his
tongue
he
found
how
deep
would
be
the
wound
in
his
peace
should
she
ever
give
her
hand
to
another
than
himself
confounded
at
this
discovery
of
a
passion
the
seeds
of
which
he
supposed
had
been
crushed
by
the
weight
of
his
misfortunes
and
the
depths
of
his
griefs
he
proceeded
homewards
in
a
trance
of
thought
not
far
differing
from
that
of
the
dreamer
who
sinks
into
a
harassing
slumber
and
filled
with
terror
doubts
whether
he
be
sleeping
or
awake
the
sudden
illness
of
general
butzou
having
put
these
ideas
to
flight
thaddeus
was
sitting
on
the
bedside
with
his
anxious
thoughts
fixed
on
the
pale
spectacle
of
mortality
before
him
when
nanny
brought
in
a
letter
from
the
countess
he
took
it
and
going
to
the
window
read
with
mingled
feelings
the
folding
epistle
to
mr
constantine
i
know
not
my
dear
count
when
i
shall
be
permitted
to
see
you
again
perhaps
never
on
this
side
of
the
grave
since
heaven
has
denied
me
the
tenderness
of
my
own
children
it
would
have
been
a
comfort
to
me
might
i
have
continued
to
act
a
parent
part
by
you
but
my
cruel
lord
and
my
more
cruel
son
jealous
of
the
consolation
i
meet
in
the
society
of
my
few
intimate
friends
command
me
to
quit
london
and
as
i
have
ever
made
it
a
rule
to
conform
to
their
injunctions
to
the
furthest
extent
of
my
power
i
shall
go
it
pierces
me
to
the
soul
my
dear
son
allow
my
maternal
heart
to
call
you
by
that
name
it
distresses
me
deeply
that
i
am
compelled
to
leave
the
place
where
you
are
and
the
more
that
i
can
not
see
you
before
my
departure
for
i
quit
town
early
write
to
me
often
my
loved
sobieski
your
letters
will
be
some
alleviation
to
my
lot
during
the
fulfilment
of
my
hard
duty
wear
the
enclosed
gold
chain
for
my
sake
it
is
one
of
two
given
me
a
long
time
ago
by
miss
beaufort
if
i
have
not
greatly
mistaken
you
the
present
will
now
possess
a
double
value
in
your
estimation
indeed
it
ought
sensibility
and
thankfulness
being
properties
of
your
nature
they
will
not
deny
a
lively
gratitude
to
the
generous
interest
with
which
that
amiable
and
noble
young
woman
regards
your
fate
it
is
impossible
that
the
avowed
count
sobieski
whom
a
year
ago
i
remember
her
animated
fancy
painted
in
colors
worthy
of
his
actions
could
excite
more
of
her
esteem
than
i
know
she
has
bestowed
on
the
untitled
constantine
she
is
all
nobleness
and
affection
for
although
i
am
sensible
that
she
would
leave
much
behind
her
in
london
to
regret
she
insists
on
accompanying
me
to
the
wolds
averse
to
transgress
so
far
on
her
goodness
i
firmly
refused
her
offer
until
this
evening
when
i
received
so
warm
and
urgent
a
letter
from
her
disinterested
generous
heart
that
i
could
no
longer
withhold
my
grateful
assent
indeed
this
lovely
creature
active
friendship
proves
of
high
consequence
to
me
now
situated
as
i
am
with
regard
to
a
new
whim
of
the
earl
had
she
not
thus
urged
me
in
obedience
to
my
commands
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
go
alone
he
having
taken
some
wild
antipathy
to
miss
egerton
whose
company
he
has
interdicted
at
any
rate
her
parents
would
not
have
allowed
me
her
society
much
longer
for
montresor
is
to
return
this
month
i
shall
not
be
easy
my
dear
count
until
i
hear
from
you
pray
write
soon
and
inform
me
of
every
particular
respecting
the
poor
general
is
he
likely
to
recover
in
all
things
my
loved
son
in
which
i
can
serve
you
remember
that
i
expect
you
will
refer
yourself
to
me
as
to
a
mother
your
own
could
hardly
have
regarded
you
with
deeper
tenderness
than
does
your
affectionate
and
faithful
adeliza
tinemouth
grosvenor
place
direct
to
me
at
harwold
place
wolds
lincolnshire
several
opposite
emotions
agitated
the
mind
of
thaddeus
whilst
reading
this
epistle
increased
abhorrence
of
the
man
whom
he
believed
to
be
his
father
and
distress
at
the
increase
of
his
cruelty
to
his
unhappy
wife
yet
these
could
neither
subdue
the
balmy
effect
of
her
maternal
affection
towards
himself
nor
wholly
check
the
emotion
which
the
unusual
mentioning
of
miss
beaufort
name
had
caused
his
heart
to
throb
he
read
the
sentence
which
contained
the
assurance
of
her
esteem
a
third
time
delicious
poison
cried
he
kissing
the
paper
if
adoring
thee
lovely
mary
be
added
to
my
other
trials
i
shall
be
resigned
there
is
sweetness
even
in
the
thought
could
i
credit
all
which
my
dear
lady
tinemouth
affirms
the
conviction
that
i
possess
one
kind
solicitude
in
the
mind
of
miss
beaufort
would
be
ample
compensation
for
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
but
sighing
profoundly
rose
from
his
chair
for
anything
except
beholding
her
the
bride
of
another
was
the
sentiment
with
which
his
heart
swelled
thaddeus
had
never
known
a
selfish
wish
in
his
life
and
this
first
instance
of
his
desiring
that
good
to
be
unappropriated
which
he
might
not
himself
enjoy
made
him
start
there
is
an
evil
in
my
breast
i
wotted
not
of
dissatisfied
with
himself
at
this
he
was
preparing
to
answer
her
ladyship
letter
when
turning
to
the
date
he
discovered
that
it
had
been
written
on
thursday
night
and
in
consequence
of
nanny
neglect
in
not
calling
at
the
had
been
delayed
a
day
and
a
half
before
it
reached
him
his
disappointment
at
this
accident
was
severe
she
was
gone
and
miss
beaufort
along
with
her
then
indeed
i
am
unfortunate
yet
this
treasure
cried
he
fondly
clasping
the
separated
bracelet
in
his
hand
it
will
indeed
be
a
representative
of
both
honored
beloved
to
this
deserted
heart
he
put
the
chain
round
his
neck
and
with
a
true
feeling
thought
that
it
warmed
the
heart
which
mortification
had
chilled
but
the
fancy
was
evanescent
and
he
again
turned
to
watch
the
fading
life
of
his
friend
during
the
lapse
of
a
few
days
in
which
the
general
appeared
merely
to
breathe
thaddeus
instead
of
his
attendance
despatched
regular
notes
of
excuse
to
harley
street
in
answer
to
these
he
commonly
received
little
tender
billets
from
euphemia
the
strain
of
which
he
seemed
totally
to
overlook
by
the
cold
respect
he
evinced
in
his
continued
diurnal
apologies
for
absence
this
young
lady
was
so
full
of
her
own
lamentations
over
the
trouble
which
her
elegant
tutor
must
endure
in
watching
his
sick
friend
that
she
never
thought
it
worth
while
to
mention
in
her
notes
any
creature
in
the
house
excepting
herself
and
her
commiseration
thaddeus
longed
to
inquire
about
miss
beaufort
but
the
more
he
wished
it
the
greater
was
his
reluctance
to
write
her
name
things
were
in
this
situation
when
one
evening
as
he
was
reading
by
the
light
of
a
solitary
candle
in
his
little
the
door
opened
and
nanny
stepped
in
followed
by
a
female
wrapped
in
a
large
black
cloak
thaddeus
rose
a
lady
sir
said
nanny
curtseying
the
moment
the
girl
withdrew
the
visitor
cast
herself
into
a
chair
and
sobbing
aloud
seemed
in
violent
agitation
thaddeus
astonished
and
alarmed
approached
her
and
though
she
was
unknown
offered
her
every
assistance
in
his
power
catching
hold
of
the
hand
which
with
the
greatest
respect
he
extended
towards
her
she
instantly
displayed
to
his
dismayed
sight
the
features
of
lady
sara
ross
merciful
heaven
exclaimed
he
involuntarily
starting
back
do
not
cast
me
off
constantine
cried
she
clasping
his
arm
and
looking
up
to
him
with
a
face
of
anguish
on
you
alone
i
now
depend
for
happiness
for
existence
a
cold
damp
stood
on
the
forehead
of
her
auditor
dear
lady
sara
what
am
i
to
understand
by
this
emotion
has
anything
dreadful
happened
is
captain
ross
lady
sara
shuddered
and
still
grasping
his
hand
answered
with
words
every
one
of
which
palsied
the
heart
of
thaddeus
he
is
coming
home
he
is
now
at
portsmouth
o
constantine
i
am
not
yet
so
debased
as
to
live
with
him
when
my
heart
is
yours
at
this
shameful
declaration
thaddeus
clenched
his
teeth
in
agony
of
spirit
and
placing
his
hand
upon
his
eyes
to
shut
her
from
his
sight
he
turned
suddenly
round
and
walked
towards
another
part
of
the
room
lady
sara
followed
him
her
cloak
having
fallen
off
now
displayed
her
fine
form
in
all
the
fervor
of
grief
and
distraction
she
rung
her
fair
and
jewelled
arms
in
despair
and
with
accents
rendered
more
piercing
by
the
anguish
of
her
mind
exclaimed
what
you
hate
me
you
throw
me
from
you
cruel
barbarous
constantine
can
you
drive
from
your
feet
the
woman
who
adores
you
can
you
cast
her
who
is
without
a
home
into
the
streets
thaddeus
felt
his
hand
wet
with
her
tears
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
her
with
almost
delirious
horror
her
hat
being
off
gave
freedom
to
her
long
black
hair
which
falling
in
masses
over
her
figure
and
face
gave
such
additional
wildness
to
the
imploring
and
frantic
expression
of
her
eyes
that
his
distracted
soul
felt
reeling
within
him
rise
madam
for
heaven
sake
lady
sara
and
he
stooped
to
raise
her
never
cried
she
clinging
to
him
never
till
you
promise
to
protect
me
my
husband
comes
home
and
i
have
left
his
house
forever
you
you
exclaimed
she
extending
her
hand
to
his
averted
face
oh
constantine
you
have
robbed
me
of
my
peace
on
your
account
i
have
flown
from
my
home
for
mercy
sake
do
not
abandon
me
lady
sara
cried
he
looking
in
desperation
around
him
i
can
not
speak
to
you
in
this
position
rise
i
implore
you
only
returned
she
only
say
that
you
will
protect
me
that
i
shall
find
shelter
here
say
this
and
i
will
rise
and
bless
you
forever
thaddeus
stood
aghast
not
knowing
how
to
reply
at
the
violent
lengths
to
which
she
seemed
determined
to
carry
her
unhappy
and
guilty
passion
he
in
vain
sought
to
evade
this
direct
demand
lady
sara
perceiving
the
reluctance
and
horror
of
his
looks
sprang
from
her
knees
while
in
a
more
resolute
voice
she
exclaimed
then
sir
you
will
not
protect
me
you
scorn
and
desert
a
woman
whom
you
well
know
has
long
loved
you
whom
by
your
artful
behavior
you
have
seduced
to
this
disgrace
the
count
surprised
and
shocked
at
this
accusation
with
gentleness
but
resolution
denied
the
charge
lady
sara
again
melted
into
tears
and
supporting
her
tottering
frame
against
his
shoulder
replied
in
a
stifled
voice
i
know
it
well
i
have
nothing
to
blame
for
my
wretched
state
but
my
own
weakness
pardon
dear
constantine
the
dictates
of
my
madness
oh
i
would
gladly
owe
such
misery
to
any
other
source
than
myself
then
respected
lady
rejoined
thaddeus
gaining
courage
from
the
mildness
of
her
manner
let
me
implore
you
to
return
to
your
own
house
do
ask
me
cried
she
grasping
his
hand
o
constantine
if
you
knew
what
it
was
to
receive
with
smiles
of
affection
a
creature
whom
you
loathe
you
would
shrink
with
disgust
from
what
you
require
i
detest
captain
ross
can
i
open
my
arms
to
meet
him
when
my
heart
excludes
him
forever
can
i
welcome
him
home
when
i
wish
him
in
his
grave
sobieski
extricated
his
hand
from
her
grasp
her
ladyship
perceived
the
repugnance
which
dictated
this
action
and
with
renewed
violence
ejaculated
unhappy
woman
that
i
am
to
hate
where
i
am
loved
to
love
where
i
am
hated
kill
me
constantine
cried
she
turning
suddenly
towards
him
and
sinking
clown
on
a
chair
but
do
not
give
me
such
another
look
as
that
dear
lady
sara
replied
he
seating
himself
by
her
side
what
would
you
have
me
do
you
see
that
i
have
no
proper
means
of
protecting
you
i
have
no
relations
no
friends
to
receive
you
you
see
that
i
am
a
poor
man
besides
your
character
talk
not
of
my
character
cried
she
i
will
have
none
that
does
not
depend
on
you
cruel
constantine
you
will
not
understand
me
i
want
no
riches
no
friends
but
yourself
give
me
home
and
arms
added
she
throwing
herself
in
an
agony
on
his
bosom
and
beggary
would
be
paradise
but
i
shall
not
bring
you
poverty
i
have
inherited
a
fortune
since
i
married
ross
on
which
he
has
no
claim
thaddeus
now
shrunk
doubly
from
her
why
had
she
not
felt
a
sacred
spell
in
that
husband
name
he
shuddered
and
tore
himself
from
her
clinging
arms
holding
her
off
with
his
hand
he
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
mental
agony
infatuated
woman
leave
me
for
his
honor
and
your
own
peace
no
no
cried
she
hoping
she
had
gained
some
advantage
over
his
agitated
feelings
and
again
casting
herself
at
his
feet
exclaimed
never
will
i
leave
this
spot
till
you
consent
that
your
home
shall
be
my
home
that
i
shall
serve
you
forever
thaddeus
pressed
his
hands
upon
his
eyes
as
if
he
would
shut
her
from
his
sight
but
with
streaming
tears
she
added
while
clasping
his
other
hand
to
her
throbbing
bosom
exclude
me
not
from
those
dear
eyes
reject
me
not
from
being
your
true
wife
your
willing
slave
thaddeus
heard
this
but
he
did
not
look
on
her
neither
did
he
answer
he
broke
from
her
and
fled
in
a
stupor
of
horror
at
his
situation
into
the
apartment
where
the
general
lay
in
a
heavy
sleep
little
expecting
to
see
anyone
but
the
man
she
loved
lady
sara
rushed
in
after
him
and
was
again
wildly
pressing
towards
her
determined
victim
when
her
eyes
were
suddenly
arrested
by
a
livid
and
she
thought
dead
face
of
a
person
lying
on
the
bed
fixed
to
the
spot
she
stood
for
a
moment
then
putting
her
spread
hand
on
her
forehead
uttered
a
faint
cry
and
fell
to
the
floor
having
instant
conviction
of
her
mistake
thaddeus
eagerly
seized
the
moment
of
her
insensibility
to
convey
her
home
he
hastily
went
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
called
to
nanny
to
run
for
a
coach
and
then
returning
to
the
extended
figure
of
lady
sara
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
back
to
the
room
they
had
left
by
the
help
of
a
little
water
he
restored
her
to
a
sense
of
existence
she
slowly
opened
her
eyes
then
raising
her
head
looked
round
with
a
terrified
air
when
her
eye
falling
on
the
still
open
door
of
the
general
room
she
caught
thaddeus
by
the
arm
and
said
in
a
shuddering
voice
oh
take
me
hence
whilst
she
yet
spoke
the
coach
stopped
at
the
door
the
count
rose
and
attempted
to
support
her
agitated
frame
on
his
arm
but
she
trembled
so
he
was
obliged
to
almost
carry
her
down
stairs
when
he
placed
her
in
the
carriage
she
said
in
a
faint
tone
you
surely
will
not
leave
me
thaddeus
made
no
reply
then
desiring
nanny
to
sit
by
the
general
until
his
return
which
should
be
in
a
few
minutes
and
having
stepped
into
the
coach
lady
sara
snatched
his
hand
while
in
dismayed
accents
she
quickly
said
who
was
that
fearful
person
alas
the
revered
friend
whose
long
illness
lady
tinemouth
has
sometimes
mentioned
in
your
presence
lady
sara
shuddered
again
but
with
a
rush
of
tears
while
she
added
imploringly
then
whither
are
you
going
to
take
me
you
shall
again
dear
lady
sara
replied
he
return
to
guiltless
and
peaceful
home
i
can
not
meet
my
husband
cried
she
wringing
her
hands
he
will
see
all
my
premeditated
guilt
in
my
countenance
o
constantine
have
pity
on
me
miserable
creature
that
i
am
it
is
horrible
to
live
without
you
it
is
dreadful
to
live
with
him
take
me
not
home
i
entreat
you
the
count
took
her
clasped
hands
in
his
saying
reflect
for
a
moment
lady
tinemouth
eulogiums
on
our
first
acquaintance
taught
me
to
honor
you
i
believe
that
when
you
distinguished
me
with
any
portion
of
your
regard
it
was
in
consequence
of
virtues
which
you
thought
i
possessed
indeed
you
do
me
justice
cried
she
with
renewed
energy
he
continued
feeling
that
he
must
be
stern
in
words
as
well
as
in
purpose
if
he
would
really
rescue
her
from
herself
think
then
should
i
yield
to
the
influence
of
your
beauty
and
sink
your
respected
name
to
a
level
with
those
and
he
pointed
to
a
group
of
wretched
women
assembled
at
the
corner
of
think
where
would
be
the
price
of
your
innocence
i
being
no
longer
worthy
of
your
esteem
you
would
hate
yourself
and
we
should
continue
together
two
guilty
creatures
abhorring
each
other
and
justly
despised
by
a
virtuous
world
lady
sara
sat
as
one
dumb
and
did
not
inarticulate
any
sound
except
the
groan
of
horror
which
had
shot
through
her
when
she
had
glanced
at
those
women
until
the
coach
stopped
in
james
place
go
in
with
me
were
all
the
words
she
could
utter
while
pulling
her
veil
over
her
face
she
gave
him
her
hand
to
assist
her
down
the
steps
is
captain
ross
arrived
asked
thaddeus
of
a
servant
who
to
his
great
joy
replied
in
the
negative
during
the
drive
he
had
alarmed
himself
by
anticipating
the
disagreeable
suspicions
which
might
rise
in
the
mind
of
the
husband
should
he
see
his
wife
in
her
present
strange
and
distracted
state
when
thaddeus
seated
lady
sara
in
her
drawing
room
he
offered
to
take
a
respectful
leave
but
she
laid
one
hand
on
his
arm
whilst
with
the
other
she
covered
her
convulsed
features
and
said
constantine
before
you
go
before
we
part
perhaps
eternally
o
tell
me
that
you
do
not
even
now
hate
me
that
you
do
not
hate
me
repeated
she
in
a
firmer
tone
i
know
too
well
how
deeply
i
am
despised
cease
ah
cease
these
vehement
returned
he
tenderly
replacing
her
on
the
sofa
shame
does
not
depend
on
possessing
passions
but
in
yielding
to
them
you
have
conquered
yours
dear
lady
sara
and
in
future
i
must
respect
and
love
you
like
a
sister
of
my
heart
noble
constantine
there
is
no
guile
in
thee
exclaimed
she
straining
his
hand
to
her
lips
may
heaven
bless
you
wherever
you
go
he
dropped
on
his
knees
imprinted
on
both
her
hands
a
true
sacred
kiss
and
hastily
rising
was
quitting
the
room
without
a
word
when
he
heard
in
a
short
low
sound
from
her
voice
o
why
had
i
not
a
mother
a
sister
to
love
and
pity
me
should
i
have
been
such
a
wretch
as
now
thaddeus
turned
from
the
door
at
the
tone
and
substance
of
this
apparently
unconsciously
uttered
apostrophe
she
was
standing
with
her
hands
clasped
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
by
an
irresistible
impulse
he
approached
her
lady
sara
said
he
with
a
tender
reverence
in
his
voice
there
is
penitence
and
prayer
to
a
better
parent
in
those
words
look
up
to
him
and
he
will
save
you
from
yourself
and
bless
you
in
your
husband
she
did
raise
her
eyes
at
this
adjuration
and
without
one
earthward
glance
at
her
young
monitor
in
their
movement
to
the
heaven
she
sought
neither
did
she
speak
but
pressed
with
an
unutterable
emotion
the
hand
which
now
held
hers
while
his
own
heart
did
indeed
silently
the
prayer
he
saw
in
her
upward
eyes
turning
gently
away
he
glided
in
a
suffusion
of
grateful
tears
out
of
the
apartment
chapter
xxxiv
requiescat
in
pace
the
amazement
which
enveloped
the
count
faculties
after
the
preceding
scene
was
dissipated
next
morning
by
the
appearance
of
cavendish
when
he
saw
the
general
he
declared
it
to
be
his
opinion
that
in
consequence
of
his
long
and
tranquil
slumbers
some
favorable
crisis
seemed
near
probably
added
he
the
recovery
of
his
intellects
such
phenomena
in
these
cases
often
happen
immediately
before
death
heaven
grant
it
may
in
this
ejaculated
thaddeus
to
hear
his
venerable
voice
again
acknowledge
that
i
have
acted
by
him
as
became
the
grandson
of
his
friend
would
be
a
comfort
to
me
but
sir
replied
the
kind
physician
touching
his
burning
hand
you
must
not
forget
the
cares
which
are
due
to
your
own
life
if
you
wish
well
to
the
general
during
the
few
days
he
may
have
to
live
you
are
indispensably
obliged
to
preserve
your
own
strength
you
are
already
ill
and
require
air
i
have
an
hour
of
leisure
continued
he
pulling
out
his
watch
i
will
remain
here
till
you
have
taken
two
or
three
walks
round
james
park
it
is
absolutely
necessary
in
this
instance
i
must
take
the
privilege
of
friendship
and
insist
on
obedience
seeing
the
benevolent
cavendish
would
not
be
denied
thaddeus
took
his
hat
and
with
harassed
spirits
walked
down
the
lane
towards
charing
cross
on
entering
spring
garden
gate
to
his
extreme
surprise
the
first
objects
that
met
his
sight
were
miss
euphemia
dundas
and
miss
beaufort
euphemia
accosted
him
with
ten
thousand
inquiries
respecting
his
friend
besides
congratulations
on
his
own
good
looks
thaddeus
bowed
then
smiling
faintly
turned
to
the
blushing
mary
who
conscious
of
what
had
passed
in
the
late
conversation
between
herself
and
lady
tinemouth
trembled
so
much
that
fearing
to
excite
the
suspicion
of
euphemia
by
such
tremor
she
withdrew
her
arm
and
walked
forward
alone
tottering
at
every
step
i
thought
miss
beaufort
said
he
addressing
himself
to
her
that
lady
tinemouth
was
to
have
had
the
happiness
of
your
company
at
harwold
park
yes
returned
she
fearfully
raising
her
eyes
to
his
face
the
hectic
glow
of
which
conveyed
impressions
to
her
different
from
those
which
euphemia
expressed
but
to
my
indescribable
alarm
and
disappointment
the
morning
after
i
had
written
to
fix
my
departure
with
her
ladyship
my
aunt
foot
caught
in
the
iron
of
the
carpet
as
she
was
coming
down
stairs
and
throwing
her
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
broke
her
leg
i
could
not
quit
her
a
moment
during
her
agonies
and
the
surgeons
having
expressed
their
fears
that
a
fever
might
ensue
i
was
obliged
altogether
to
decline
my
attendance
on
the
countess
and
how
is
miss
dorothy
inquired
thaddeus
truly
concerned
at
the
accident
she
is
better
though
confined
to
her
bed
replied
euphemia
speaking
before
her
companion
could
open
her
lips
and
indeed
poor
mary
and
myself
have
been
such
close
nurses
my
mother
insisted
on
our
walking
out
and
lady
tinemouth
returned
thaddeus
again
addressing
miss
beaufort
of
course
she
went
alone
alas
yes
replied
she
miss
egerton
was
forced
to
join
her
family
in
leicestershire
i
believe
cried
euphemia
sighing
miss
egerton
is
going
to
be
married
hers
has
been
a
long
attachment
happy
girl
i
have
heard
captain
ross
say
whose
lieutenant
her
intended
husband
was
that
he
is
the
finest
young
man
in
the
navy
did
you
ever
see
mr
montresor
added
she
turning
her
pretty
eyes
on
the
count
i
never
had
that
pleasure
bless
me
that
is
odd
considering
your
intimacy
with
miss
egerton
i
assure
you
he
is
very
charming
thaddeus
neither
heard
this
nor
a
great
deal
more
of
the
same
trifling
which
was
slipping
from
the
tongue
of
miss
euphemia
so
intently
were
his
eyes
sent
by
his
heart
searching
the
downcast
but
expressive
countenance
of
miss
beaufort
his
soul
was
full
and
the
fluctuations
of
her
color
with
the
embarrassment
of
her
step
more
than
affected
him
then
you
do
not
leave
town
for
some
time
miss
beaufort
inquired
he
i
may
yet
anticipate
the
honor
of
seeing
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
added
in
a
depressed
tone
your
aunt
when
i
next
wait
on
the
misses
dundas
our
stay
depends
entirely
on
her
health
returned
she
striving
to
rally
herself
and
i
am
sure
she
will
be
happy
to
find
you
better
for
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
can
not
agree
with
euphemia
in
thinking
you
look
well
merely
a
slight
indisposition
replied
he
the
effect
of
an
anxiety
which
i
fear
will
too
soon
cease
in
the
death
of
its
cause
i
came
out
now
for
a
little
air
whilst
the
physician
remains
with
my
revered
friend
poor
old
gentleman
sighed
mary
how
venerable
was
his
appearance
the
morning
in
which
we
saw
him
in
the
park
what
a
benign
countenance
his
countenance
replied
thaddeus
his
eyes
turning
mournfully
towards
the
lovely
speaker
is
the
emblem
of
his
character
he
was
the
most
amiable
of
men
and
you
are
likely
to
lose
so
interesting
a
friend
dear
constantine
how
i
pity
you
while
euphemia
uttered
these
words
she
put
the
corner
of
her
glove
to
her
eye
the
count
looked
at
her
and
perceiving
that
her
commiseration
was
affectation
he
turned
to
miss
beaufort
who
was
walking
pensively
by
his
side
and
made
further
inquiries
respecting
miss
dorothy
anxious
to
be
again
with
his
invalid
he
was
preparing
to
quit
them
when
mary
as
with
a
full
heart
she
curtseyed
her
adieu
in
a
hurried
and
confused
manner
said
pray
constantine
take
care
of
yourself
you
have
other
friends
besides
the
one
you
are
going
to
lose
i
know
lady
tinemouth
i
know
my
aunt
she
stopped
short
and
covered
with
blushes
stood
panting
for
another
word
to
close
the
sentence
when
thaddeus
forgetting
all
presence
but
her
own
with
delighted
precipitancy
caught
hold
of
the
hand
which
in
her
confusion
was
a
little
extended
towards
him
and
pressing
it
with
fervor
relinquished
it
immediately
then
overcome
by
confusion
at
the
presumption
of
the
action
he
bowed
with
agitation
to
both
ladies
and
hastened
through
the
friary
passage
into
james
street
miss
beaufort
cried
euphemia
reddening
with
vexation
and
returning
a
perfumed
handkerchief
to
her
pocket
i
did
not
understand
that
you
and
constantine
were
on
such
intimate
terms
what
do
you
mean
euphemia
that
you
have
betrayed
the
confidence
i
reposed
in
you
cried
the
angry
beauty
wiping
away
the
really
starting
tears
with
her
white
lace
cloak
i
told
you
the
elegant
constantine
was
the
lord
of
my
heart
and
you
have
seduced
him
from
me
till
you
came
he
was
so
respectful
so
tender
so
devoted
bat
i
am
rightly
used
i
ought
to
have
carried
my
secret
to
the
grave
in
vain
miss
beaufort
protested
in
vain
she
declared
herself
ignorant
of
possessing
any
power
over
even
one
wish
of
constantine
euphemia
thought
it
monstrous
pretty
to
be
the
injured
friend
and
forsaken
mistress
and
all
along
the
park
and
up
until
they
arrived
at
lady
dundas
carriage
which
was
waiting
opposite
devonshire
wall
she
affected
to
weep
when
seated
she
continued
her
invectives
she
called
miss
beaufort
ungenerous
perfidious
traitor
to
friendship
and
every
romantic
and
disloyal
name
which
her
inflamed
fancy
could
devise
till
the
sight
of
harley
street
checked
her
transports
and
relieved
her
patient
hearer
from
a
load
of
impertinence
and
reproach
during
this
short
interview
thaddeus
had
received
an
impulse
to
his
affections
which
hurried
them
forward
with
a
force
that
neither
time
nor
succeeding
sorrows
could
stop
nor
stem
mary
eyes
seemed
to
have
encircled
his
head
with
love
purest
halo
the
command
preserve
yourself
for
others
besides
your
dying
friend
yet
throbbed
at
his
heart
and
with
ten
thousand
rapturous
visions
flitting
before
his
sight
he
trod
in
air
until
the
humble
door
of
his
melancholy
home
presenting
itself
at
once
wrecked
the
illusion
and
offered
sad
reality
in
the
person
of
his
emaciated
friend
on
the
count
entrance
to
the
sick
chamber
doctor
cavendish
gave
him
a
few
directions
to
pursue
when
the
general
should
awake
from
the
sleep
into
which
he
had
been
sunk
for
so
many
hours
with
a
heart
the
more
depressed
from
its
late
unusual
exaltation
thaddeus
sat
down
at
the
side
of
the
invalid
bed
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
at
five
in
the
afternoon
general
butzou
awoke
seeing
the
count
he
stretched
out
his
withered
hand
and
as
the
doctor
predicted
accosted
him
rationally
come
dear
sobieski
come
nearer
my
dear
master
thaddeus
rose
and
throwing
himself
on
his
knees
took
the
offered
hand
with
apparent
composure
it
was
a
hard
struggle
to
restrain
the
emotions
which
were
roused
by
this
awful
contemplation
the
return
of
reason
to
the
soul
on
the
instant
she
was
summoned
into
the
presence
of
her
maker
my
kind
my
beloved
lord
added
butzou
to
me
you
have
indeed
performed
a
christian
part
you
have
clothed
sheltered
and
preserved
me
in
your
bosom
blessed
son
of
my
most
honored
master
the
good
old
man
put
the
hand
of
thaddeus
to
his
lips
thaddeus
could
not
speak
i
am
going
dear
sobieski
continued
the
general
in
a
lower
voice
where
i
shall
meet
your
noble
grandfather
your
mother
and
my
brave
countrymen
and
if
heaven
grants
me
power
i
will
tell
them
by
whose
labor
i
have
lived
on
whose
breast
i
have
expired
thaddeus
could
no
longer
restrain
his
tears
dear
dear
general
exclaimed
he
grasping
his
hand
my
grandfather
my
mother
my
country
i
lose
them
all
again
in
thee
o
would
that
the
same
summons
took
me
hence
hush
returned
the
dying
man
heaven
reserves
you
my
honored
lord
for
wise
purposes
youth
and
health
are
the
marks
of
commission
footnote
i
can
not
but
pause
here
in
revising
the
volume
to
publicly
express
the
emotion
grateful
to
heaven
i
experienced
on
receiving
a
letter
quoting
these
words
many
many
years
ago
it
was
from
the
excellent
joseph
fox
the
christian
philanthropist
of
our
country
who
spent
both
his
fortune
and
his
life
in
establishing
and
sustaining
several
of
our
best
charitable
and
otherwise
patriotic
institutions
and
once
when
some
of
his
anxious
friends
would
gladly
have
persuaded
him
to
grant
himself
more
personal
indulgences
and
to
labor
less
in
the
then
plans
for
national
education
he
wrote
to
the
author
of
thaddeus
of
warsaw
and
quoting
to
her
those
words
from
the
work
declared
they
were
on
his
heart
and
he
would
with
the
blessing
of
god
perform
what
he
believed
to
be
his
commission
to
the
last
powers
of
his
youth
and
health
this
admirable
man
has
now
been
long
removed
to
his
heavenly
country
to
the
everlasting
of
the
just
made
perfect
and
such
recollections
can
not
but
make
an
historical
at
least
feel
answerable
for
more
in
his
or
her
pages
than
the
purposes
of
mere
amusement
they
guide
by
examples
plutarch
in
his
lives
of
grecian
and
roman
worthies
taught
more
effectually
the
heroic
and
virtuous
science
of
life
than
did
all
his
philosophical
works
put
together
possess
them
with
virtues
which
will
bear
you
through
the
contest
have
done
and
my
merciful
judge
has
evinced
his
pardon
of
my
errors
by
sparing
me
in
my
old
age
and
leading
me
to
die
with
you
thaddeus
pressed
his
friend
hand
to
his
streaming
eyes
and
promised
to
be
resigned
butzou
smiled
his
satisfaction
then
closing
his
eyelids
he
composed
himself
to
a
rest
that
was
neither
sleep
nor
stupor
but
a
balmy
serenity
which
seemed
to
be
tempering
his
lately
recovered
soul
for
its
immediate
entrance
on
a
world
of
eternal
peace
at
nine
his
breath
became
broken
with
quick
sighs
the
count
heart
trembled
and
he
drew
closer
to
the
pillow
butzou
felt
him
and
opening
his
eyes
languidly
articulated
raise
my
head
thaddeus
put
his
arm
under
his
neck
and
lifting
him
up
reclined
him
against
his
bosom
butzou
grasped
his
hands
and
looking
gratefully
in
his
face
said
the
arms
of
a
soldier
should
be
a
i
am
content
he
lay
for
a
moment
on
the
breast
of
the
almost
fainting
thaddeus
then
suddenly
quitting
his
hold
he
cried
i
lose
you
sobieski
but
there
is
and
he
gazed
fixedly
forward
i
am
here
exclaimed
the
count
catching
his
motionless
hand
the
dying
general
murmured
a
few
words
more
and
turning
his
face
inward
breathed
his
last
sigh
on
the
bosom
of
his
last
friend
for
a
minute
sobieski
continued
incapable
of
thought
or
action
when
he
recovered
recollection
he
withdrew
from
his
melancholy
station
laying
the
venerable
remains
back
on
the
bed
he
did
not
trust
his
rallied
faculties
with
a
second
trial
but
hastening
down
stairs
was
met
by
robson
my
dear
madam
said
he
all
is
over
with
my
poor
friend
will
you
do
me
the
kindness
to
perform
those
duties
to
his
sacred
relics
which
i
can
not
thaddeus
would
not
allow
any
person
to
watch
by
his
friend
coffin
besides
himself
the
meditations
of
this
solitary
night
presented
to
his
sound
and
sensible
mind
every
argument
rather
to
induce
rejoicing
than
regret
that
the
eventful
life
of
the
brave
butzou
was
terminated
yes
illustrious
old
man
cried
he
gazing
on
his
marble
features
if
valor
and
virtue
be
the
true
sources
of
nobility
thou
surely
wast
noble
inestimable
defender
of
stanislaus
and
thy
country
thou
hast
run
a
long
and
bright
career
and
though
thou
art
fated
to
rest
in
the
humble
grave
of
poverty
it
will
be
embalmed
by
the
tears
of
heaven
it
will
be
engraven
on
my
heart
thaddeus
did
not
weep
whilst
he
spoke
nor
did
he
weep
when
he
beheld
the
mold
of
paul
covent
garden
close
from
his
view
the
last
remains
of
his
friend
it
began
to
rain
the
uncovered
head
of
the
officiating
minister
was
wet
and
so
was
that
of
a
little
delicate
boy
in
a
black
cloak
who
stood
near
holding
the
aged
rector
hat
during
the
service
as
the
shower
descended
faster
cavendish
put
his
arm
through
the
count
to
draw
him
away
but
he
lingered
an
instant
looking
on
the
mold
while
the
sexton
piled
it
up
wretched
poland
sighed
he
how
far
from
thee
lies
one
of
thy
bravest
sons
the
words
were
breathed
in
so
low
a
murmur
that
none
heard
them
except
the
ear
of
heaven
and
that
little
boy
whose
gaze
had
been
some
time
fixed
on
thaddeus
and
whose
gentle
heart
never
forgot
them
cavendish
regarding
with
redoubled
pity
the
now
doubly
desolated
exile
in
this
last
resignation
of
his
parental
friend
to
a
foreign
grave
attempted
to
persuade
him
to
return
with
him
to
dinner
he
refused
the
kind
invitation
alleging
with
a
faint
smile
that
under
every
misfortune
he
found
his
best
comforter
in
solitude
respecting
the
resignation
and
manliness
of
this
answer
doctor
cavendish
urged
him
no
further
but
expressing
his
regret
that
he
could
not
see
him
again
until
the
end
of
the
week
as
he
was
obliged
to
go
to
stanford
next
day
on
a
medical
consultation
he
shook
hands
with
him
at
the
door
of
robson
and
bade
him
farewell
thaddeus
entered
his
lonely
room
and
fell
on
his
knees
before
the
ark
of
his
strength
the
holy
book
that
had
been
the
gift
of
his
mother
the
first
page
he
opened
presented
to
him
the
very
words
which
had
poured
consolation
onto
his
sad
heart
from
the
lips
of
the
venerable
clergyman
when
he
met
him
on
his
entrance
into
the
porch
before
the
coffin
of
his
friend
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
saith
the
lord
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
and
whosoever
liveth
and
believeth
in
me
shall
never
die
after
reading
this
how
truly
did
the
young
mourner
feel
that
death
had
lost
its
sting
the
grave
its
victory
chapter

deep
are
the
purposes
of
adversity
next
morning
when
the
count
sobieski
unfolded
the
several
packets
of
papers
which
were
put
into
his
hands
by
little
nanny
he
laid
them
one
after
the
other
on
the
table
and
sighing
heavily
said
to
himself
now
comes
the
bitterness
of
poverty
heaven
only
knows
by
what
means
i
shall
pay
these
heavy
charges
mere
personal
privations
induced
by
his
fallen
fortunes
excited
little
uneasiness
in
the
mind
of
thaddeus
as
he
never
had
derived
peculiar
gratification
from
the
enjoyment
of
a
magnificent
house
splendid
table
and
numerous
attendants
he
was
contented
in
the
field
where
he
slept
on
the
bare
ground
and
snatched
his
hasty
meals
at
uncertain
intervals
watching
rough
fare
and
other
hardships
were
dust
in
the
path
of
honor
he
had
dashed
through
them
with
light
and
buoyant
spirits
and
he
repined
as
little
at
the
actual
wants
of
his
forlorn
state
in
exile
until
compelled
by
friendship
to
contract
demands
which
he
could
not
defray
he
was
plunged
at
once
into
the
full
horrors
of
poverty
and
debt
he
looked
at
the
amount
of
the
bills
the
apothecary
was
twelve
pounds
the
funeral
fifteen
thaddeus
turned
pale
the
value
of
all
that
he
possessed
would
not
produce
one
half
of
the
sum
besides
he
owed
five
guineas
to
his
good
landlady
for
numerous
little
comforts
procured
for
his
deceased
friend
whatever
be
the
consequence
cried
he
that
excellent
woman
shall
not
suffer
by
her
humanity
if
i
have
to
pay
with
the
last
memorial
of
those
who
were
so
dear
she
shall
be
repaid
he
scarcely
had
ceased
speaking
when
nanny
the
room
and
told
him
the
apothecary
young
man
and
the
undertaker
were
both
below
waiting
for
answers
to
their
letters
reddening
with
disgust
at
the
unfeeling
haste
of
these
men
he
desired
nanny
to
say
that
he
could
not
see
either
of
them
but
would
send
to
their
houses
in
consequence
of
this
promise
the
men
made
their
bows
to
robson
who
too
well
guessed
the
reason
of
this
message
and
took
their
leave
when
thaddeus
put
the
pictures
of
his
mother
and
the
palatine
with
other
precious
articles
into
his
pocket
he
could
not
forbear
an
internal
invective
against
the
thoughtless
meanness
of
the
misses
dundas
who
had
never
offered
any
further
liquidation
of
the
large
sum
they
now
stood
indebted
to
him
than
the
trifling
note
which
had
been
transmitted
to
him
prior
to
his
attendance
through
the
hands
of
lady
tinemouth
whilst
his
necessities
reproached
them
for
this
illiberal
conduct
his
proud
heart
recoiled
at
making
a
request
to
their
chanty
for
he
had
gathered
from
the
haughty
demeanor
of
miss
diana
that
what
he
was
entitled
to
demand
would
be
given
not
as
a
just
remuneration
for
labor
received
but
as
alms
of
humanity
to
an
indigent
emigrant
i
would
rather
perish
cried
he
putting
on
his
hat
than
ask
that
woman
for
a
shilling
when
the
count
laid
his
treasure
on
the
table
of
the
worthy
pawnbroker
he
desired
to
have
the
value
of
the
settings
of
the
pictures
and
the
portraits
themselves
put
into
leather
cases
with
the
other
little
things
there
were
a
pair
of
gold
spurs
the
peculiar
insignia
of
his
princely
rank
which
the
palatine
himself
had
buckled
on
his
grandson
heels
on
mounting
his
noble
charger
for
his
first
field
there
was
a
peculiar
pang
in
parting
with
these
a
sort
of
last
relic
of
what
he
had
been
but
there
was
no
alternative
all
that
had
any
intrinsic
value
must
pass
from
him
having
examined
the
setting
of
the
miniatures
and
the
gold
of
the
other
trinkets
with
that
of
the
spurs
which
their
hard
service
had
something
marred
burket
declared
on
the
word
of
an
honest
man
that
he
could
not
give
more
than
fifteen
pounds
with
difficulty
thaddeus
stifled
as
torturing
a
sigh
as
ever
distended
his
breast
whilst
he
said
i
will
take
it
i
only
implore
you
to
be
careful
of
the
things
trifling
as
they
are
circumstances
with
which
they
were
connected
render
them
valuable
to
me
to
redeem
you
may
depend
on
me
sir
replied
the
pawnbroker
presenting
him
the
notes
and
acknowledgment
when
thaddeus
took
them
burket
eye
was
caught
by
the
ring
on
his
finger
that
ring
seems
curious
if
you
wo
think
me
impertinent
may
i
ask
to
look
at
it
the
count
pulled
it
off
and
forcing
a
smile
replied
i
suppose
it
is
of
little
jewel
value
the
setting
is
slight
though
the
painting
is
fine
burket
breathed
on
the
diamonds
if
you
were
to
sell
it
returned
he
i
do
think
it
would
fetch
more
than
three
guineas
the
diamonds
are
flawed
and
the
emeralds
would
be
of
little
use
being
out
of
fashion
here
as
for
the
miniature
it
goes
for
nothing
of
course
said
thaddeus
putting
it
on
again
but
i
shall
not
part
with
it
while
he
drew
on
his
glove
burket
asked
him
whether
the
head
were
not
intended
for
the
king
of
poland
the
count
surprised
answered
in
the
affirmative
i
thought
so
answered
the
man
it
is
very
like
two
or
three
prints
which
i
had
in
my
shop
of
that
king
footnote
the
author
has
a
very
correct
likeness
of
this
memorable
king
copied
from
an
original
miniature
and
it
is
not
one
of
the
least
valued
portraits
in
a
little
room
which
contains
those
of
several
other
heroes
of
different
countries
friends
and
gallant
foes
indeed
i
believe
i
have
them
somewhere
now
these
matters
are
but
a
wonder
and
the
sale
is
over
his
auditor
did
not
clearly
comprehend
him
and
he
told
him
so
i
meant
nothing
continued
he
to
the
disparagement
of
the
king
of
poland
or
of
any
other
great
personage
who
is
much
the
subject
of
conversation
i
only
intended
to
say
that
everything
has
its
fashion
the
ruin
of
poland
was
the
fashionable
topic
for
a
month
after
it
happened
and
now
nobody
minds
it
it
is
forgotten
thaddeus
in
whose
bosom
all
its
miseries
were
written
with
a
clouded
brow
bowed
to
the
remarks
of
burket
and
in
silence
quitted
the
shop
having
arrived
at
home
he
discharged
his
debt
to
the
worthy
robson
then
entering
his
room
he
laid
the
remainder
of
his
money
on
the
bills
of
the
two
claimants
it
was
unequal
to
the
demands
of
either
yet
in
some
measure
to
be
just
to
both
he
determined
on
dividing
it
between
them
and
to
promise
the
liquidation
of
the
rest
by
degrees
surely
he
might
hope
that
even
should
the
misses
dundas
entirely
forget
his
claims
on
them
he
could
in
the
course
of
time
make
drawings
sufficient
to
discharge
the
residue
of
this
debt
but
he
was
not
permitted
to
put
this
calculation
to
the
trial
when
he
called
on
the
apothecary
and
offered
him
only
half
his
demand
the
man
refused
it
with
insolence
insisting
upon
having
the
whole
then
or
he
would
make
him
pay
for
it
unused
to
the
language
of
compulsion
and
vulgarity
the
count
quitted
the
shop
saying
he
was
at
liberty
to
act
as
he
thought
fit
with
no
very
serene
countenance
he
entered
the
undertaker
warehouse
this
man
was
civil
to
him
thaddeus
gave
the
entire
sum
half
of
which
the
apothecary
had
rejected
with
so
much
derision
the
politeness
a
little
calmed
the
irritated
feelings
of
the
count
who
returned
home
musing
on
the
vile
nature
of
that
class
of
mankind
who
can
with
indifference
heap
insult
upon
distress
judging
men
by
his
own
disposition
he
seldom
gave
credence
to
the
possibility
of
such
conduct
he
had
been
told
of
dastardly
spirits
but
never
having
seen
them
and
possessing
no
archetype
within
his
own
breast
of
what
he
heard
the
repeated
relation
passed
over
his
mind
without
leaving
an
impression
he
had
entered
the
world
filled
with
animating
hopes
of
virtue
and
renown
he
was
virtuous
he
became
powerful
great
and
renowned
creation
seemed
paradise
to
his
eyes
it
was
the
task
of
adversity
to
teach
him
a
different
lesson
of
mankind
not
less
virtuous
not
less
great
his
fortunes
fell
he
became
poor
the
perfidy
the
of
man
made
and
kept
him
friendless
when
he
wanted
succor
and
consolation
he
found
the
world
peopled
by
a
race
too
mean
even
to
bear
the
stamp
of
the
devil
whilst
sobieski
was
employed
next
morning
at
his
drawing
robson
sent
nanny
to
say
that
there
were
two
men
below
who
wanted
to
speak
with
him
not
doubting
they
were
messengers
from
the
apothecary
he
desired
the
girl
to
show
them
up
stairs
when
they
entered
his
room
the
count
rose
one
of
the
men
stepped
forward
and
laying
a
slip
of
paper
on
the
table
said
i
arrest
you
sir
at
the
suit
of
vincent
and
jackson
apothecaries
thaddeus
colored
but
suppressing
his
indignant
emotion
he
calmly
asked
the
men
whither
they
were
going
to
take
him
if
you
like
replied
one
of
them
you
may
be
well
enough
lodged
i
never
heard
a
word
against
clement
in
wych
street
is
that
a
prison
inquired
thaddeus
no
not
exactly
that
sir
answered
the
other
man
laughing
you
seem
to
know
little
of
the
matter
which
for
a
frenchman
is
odd
enough
but
mayhap
you
have
never
a
in
france
since
ye
pulled
down
the
bastile
howsoever
if
you
pay
well
clements
will
give
you
lodgings
as
long
as
you
like
it
is
only
poor
rogues
who
are
obligated
to
go
to
newgate
such
gemmen
as
you
can
live
as
ginteely
in
wych
street
as
at
their
own
houses
there
was
such
an
air
of
derision
about
this
fellow
while
he
spoke
and
glanced
around
the
room
that
thaddeus
sternly
contracting
his
brows
took
no
further
notice
of
him
but
turning
towards
his
more
civil
companion
said
has
this
person
informed
me
rightly
am
i
going
to
a
prison
or
am
i
not
if
i
do
not
possess
money
to
pay
jackson
i
can
have
none
to
spend
elsewhere
then
you
must
go
to
newgate
answered
the
man
in
as
surly
a
tone
as
his
comrade
had
been
insolent
i
run
for
a
coach
wilson
cried
the
other
opening
the
room
door
i
will
not
pay
for
one
said
thaddeus
at
once
comprehending
the
sort
of
wretches
into
whose
custody
he
had
fallen
follow
me
down
stairs
i
shall
walk
robson
was
in
her
shop
as
he
passed
to
the
street
she
called
out
you
will
come
home
to
dinner
sir
no
replied
he
but
you
shall
hear
from
me
before
night
the
men
winking
at
each
other
sullenly
pursued
his
steps
down
the
lane
in
the
strand
thaddeus
asked
them
which
way
he
was
to
proceed
straight
on
cried
one
of
them
most
folks
find
the
road
to
a
jail
easy
enough
involved
in
thought
the
count
walked
forward
unmindful
of
the
stare
which
the
occupation
of
his
attendants
attracted
towards
him
when
he
arrived
at
somerset
house
one
of
the
men
stepped
up
to
him
and
said
we
are
now
nearly
opposite
wych
street
you
had
better
take
your
mind
again
and
go
there
instead
of
newgate
i
think
your
honor
will
like
the
debtor
hole
thaddeus
coldly
thanking
him
repeated
his
determination
to
be
led
to
newgate
but
when
he
beheld
the
immense
walls
within
which
he
believed
he
should
be
immured
for
life
his
feet
seemed
rooted
to
the
ground
and
when
the
massive
doors
were
opened
and
closed
upon
him
he
felt
as
if
suddenly
deprived
of
the
vital
spring
of
existence
a
mist
spread
over
his
eyes
his
soul
shuddered
and
with
difficulty
he
followed
the
men
into
the
place
where
his
commitment
was
to
be
ratified
here
all
the
proud
energies
of
his
nature
again
rallied
round
his
heart
the
brutal
questions
of
the
people
in
office
by
taunts
from
the
wretches
who
had
brought
him
to
the
prison
were
of
a
nature
so
much
beneath
his
answering
that
he
stood
perfectly
silent
during
the
business
and
when
dismissed
without
evincing
any
signs
of
discomposure
he
followed
the
turnkey
to
his
cell
one
deal
chair
a
table
and
a
miserable
bed
were
all
the
furniture
it
contained
the
floor
was
paved
with
flags
and
the
sides
of
the
apartment
daubled
with
discolored
plaster
part
of
which
having
been
peeled
off
by
the
damp
exposed
to
view
large
spaces
of
the
naked
stones
before
the
turnkey
withdrew
he
asked
thaddeus
whether
he
wanted
anything
only
a
pen
ink
and
paper
the
man
held
out
his
hand
i
have
no
money
replied
sobieski
then
you
get
nothing
here
answered
the
fellow
pulling
the
door
after
him
thaddeus
threw
himself
on
the
chair
and
in
the
bitterness
of
his
heart
exclaimed
can
these
scoundrels
be
christians
can
they
be
men
he
cast
his
eyes
round
him
with
the
wildness
of
despair
mysterious
heaven
can
it
be
possible
that
for
a
few
guineas
i
am
to
be
confined
in
this
place
for
life
in
these
narrow
bounds
am
i
to
waste
my
youth
my
existence
even
so
i
can
not
i
will
not
degrade
the
spirit
of
poland
by
imploring
assistance
from
any
native
of
a
land
in
which
avarice
has
extinguished
the
feelings
of
humanity
by
the
next
morning
the
first
paroxysm
of
indignation
having
subsided
thaddeus
entertained
a
cooler
and
more
reasonable
opinion
of
his
situation
he
considered
that
though
he
was
a
prisoner
it
was
in
consequence
of
debts
incurred
in
behalf
of
a
friend
whose
latter
hours
were
rendered
less
wretched
by
such
means
notwithstanding
all
that
man
could
do
unto
him
he
had
brought
an
approving
conscience
to
lighten
the
gloom
of
his
dungeon
and
resuming
his
wonted
serenity
he
continued
to
distance
the
impertinent
freedom
of
his
jailers
by
a
calm
dignity
which
extorted
civility
and
commanded
respect
chapter
xxxvi
an
english
prison
several
days
elapsed
without
the
inhabitants
of
harley
street
hearing
any
tidings
of
thaddeus
miss
dundas
never
bestowed
a
thought
on
his
absence
except
when
descanting
on
her
favorite
subject
the
insolence
of
dependent
people
she
alleged
his
daring
to
withdraw
himself
as
an
instance
miss
euphemia
uttered
all
her
complaints
to
miss
beaufort
whom
she
accused
of
not
being
satisfied
with
seducing
the
affections
of
constantine
but
she
must
also
spirit
him
away
lest
by
remorse
he
should
be
induced
to
renew
his
former
devotion
at
the
shrine
of
her
tried
constancy
mary
found
these
secret
conferences
very
frequent
and
very
teasing
she
believed
neither
the
count
past
devoirs
to
euphemia
nor
his
present
allegiance
to
herself
with
anxiety
she
watched
the
slow
decline
of
every
succeeding
day
hoping
that
each
knock
at
the
door
would
present
either
himself
or
an
apology
for
his
absence
in
vain
her
reason
urged
the
weakness
and
folly
of
giving
way
to
the
influence
of
a
sentiment
as
absorbing
as
it
was
unforeseen
it
is
not
his
personal
graces
murmured
she
whilst
her
dewy
eyes
remained
riveted
on
the
floor
they
have
not
accomplished
this
effect
on
me
no
matchless
as
he
is
though
his
countenance
when
illumined
by
the
splendors
of
his
mind
expresses
consummate
beauty
yet
my
heart
tells
me
i
would
rather
see
all
that
perfection
demolished
than
lose
one
beam
of
those
bright
charities
which
first
attracted
my
esteem
yes
constantine
cried
she
rising
in
agitation
i
could
adore
thy
virtues
were
they
even
in
the
bosom
of
deformity
it
is
these
that
i
love
it
is
these
that
are
thyself
it
is
thy
noble
godlike
soul
that
so
entirely
fills
my
heart
and
must
forever
she
recalled
the
hours
which
in
his
society
had
glided
so
swiftly
by
to
pass
in
review
before
her
they
came
and
her
tears
redoubled
neither
his
words
nor
his
looks
had
been
kinder
to
her
than
to
miss
egerton
or
to
lady
sara
ross
she
remembered
his
wild
action
in
the
park
it
had
transported
her
at
the
moment
it
even
now
made
her
heart
throb
but
she
ceased
to
believe
it
intended
more
than
an
animated
expression
of
gratitude
an
adverse
apprehension
seemed
to
have
taken
possession
of
her
breast
in
proportion
to
the
vehemence
of
miss
euphemia
reproaches
who
insisted
on
the
passion
of
thaddeus
for
mary
she
the
more
doubted
the
evidence
of
those
delightful
emotions
which
had
rushed
over
her
soul
when
she
found
her
hand
so
fervently
pressed
in
his
euphemia
never
made
a
secret
of
the
tenderness
she
professed
and
miss
beaufort
having
been
taught
by
her
own
heart
to
read
distinctly
the
eyes
of
lady
sara
the
result
of
her
observations
had
long
acted
as
a
caustic
on
her
peace
it
had
often
robbed
her
cheeks
of
their
bloom
and
compelled
her
to
number
the
lingering
minutes
of
the
night
with
sighs
but
her
deep
and
modest
flame
assumed
no
violence
removed
far
from
sight
it
burnt
the
more
intensely
instead
of
the
fine
person
of
thaddeus
the
encomiums
which
it
extorted
even
from
the
lips
of
prejudice
occasioned
one
source
of
her
pain
she
could
not
bear
to
think
it
probable
that
the
man
whom
she
believed
and
knew
to
be
gifted
with
every
attribute
of
goodness
and
of
heroism
might
one
day
be
induced
to
sacrifice
the
rich
treasure
of
his
mind
to
a
creature
who
would
select
him
from
the
rest
merely
on
account
of
his
external
superiority
such
was
the
train
of
mary
meditations
covering
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
she
exclaimed
in
a
tender
and
broken
voice
ah
why
did
i
leave
my
quiet
home
to
expose
myself
to
the
vicissitudes
of
society
sequestered
from
the
world
neither
its
pageants
nor
its
mortifications
could
have
reached
me
there
i
have
seen
thee
matchless
constantine
like
a
bright
planet
thou
has
passed
before
me
like
a
being
of
a
superior
order
and
i
never
never
can
debase
my
nature
to
change
that
love
thy
image
shall
follow
me
into
solitude
shall
consecrate
my
soul
to
the
practice
of
every
virtue
i
will
emulate
thy
excellence
when
perhaps
thou
hast
forgotten
that
i
exist
the
fit
of
despondence
which
threatened
to
succeed
this
last
melancholy
reflection
was
interrupted
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
euphemia
miss
beaufort
hastily
rose
and
drew
her
ringlets
over
her
eyes
o
mary
cried
the
little
beauty
holding
up
her
pretty
hands
what
do
you
think
has
happened
what
demanded
she
in
alarm
and
hastening
towards
the
door
anything
to
my
aunt
no
no
answered
euphemia
catching
her
by
the
arm
but
could
my
injured
heart
derive
satisfaction
from
revenge
i
should
now
be
happy
punishment
has
overtaken
the
faithless
constantine
miss
beaufort
looked
aghast
and
grasping
the
back
of
the
chair
to
prevent
her
from
falling
breathlessly
inquired
what
she
meant
oh
he
is
sent
to
prison
cried
euphemia
not
regarding
the
real
agitation
of
her
auditor
so
much
was
she
occupied
in
appearing
overwhelmed
herself
and
wringing
her
hands
she
continued
that
frightful
wretch
lascelles
is
just
come
in
to
dinner
you
can
not
think
with
what
fiendish
glee
he
told
me
that
several
days
ago
as
he
was
driving
out
of
town
he
saw
constantine
with
two
bailiffs
behind
him
walking
down
fleet
street
and
besides
i
verily
believe
he
said
he
had
irons
on
no
no
ejaculated
mary
with
a
cry
of
terror
at
this
of
euphemia
what
can
he
have
done
bless
me
returned
euphemia
staring
at
her
pale
face
why
what
frightens
you
so
does
not
everybody
run
in
debt
without
minding
it
miss
beaufort
shook
her
head
and
looking
distractedly
about
put
her
hand
to
her
forehead
euphemia
determining
not
to
be
outdone
in
tender
woe
drew
forth
her
handkerchief
and
putting
it
to
her
eyes
resumed
in
a
piteous
tone
i
am
sure
i
shall
hate
lascelles
all
my
life
because
he
did
not
stop
the
men
and
inquire
what
jail
they
were
taking
him
to
you
know
my
clear
you
and
i
might
have
visited
him
it
would
have
been
delightful
to
have
consoled
his
sad
hours
we
might
have
planned
his
escape
in
irons
ejaculated
mary
raising
her
tearless
eyes
to
heaven
euphemia
colored
at
the
agonized
manner
in
which
these
words
were
reiterated
and
rather
confusedly
replied
not
absolutely
in
irons
you
know
that
is
a
metaphorical
term
for
captivity
then
he
was
not
in
irons
cried
miss
beaufort
seizing
her
hand
eagerly
for
heaven
sake
tell
me
he
was
not
in
irons
why
then
returned
euphemia
half
angry
at
being
obliged
to
contradict
herself
if
you
are
so
dull
of
taste
and
can
not
understand
poetical
language
i
must
tell
you
he
was
not
mary
heard
no
further
but
even
at
the
moment
overcome
by
a
revulsion
of
joy
sunk
unable
to
speak
into
the
chair
euphemia
supposing
she
had
fainted
flew
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
shrieking
violently
stood
wringing
her
hands
until
diana
and
lady
dundas
followed
by
several
gentlemen
hastened
out
of
the
saloon
and
demanded
what
was
the
matter
as
euphemia
pointed
to
miss
beaufort
she
staggered
and
sinking
into
the
arms
of
lord
elesmere
fell
into
the
most
outrageous
hysterics
the
marquis
who
had
just
dropped
in
on
his
return
from
james
was
so
afraid
of
the
agitated
lady
tearing
his
ruffles
that
in
almost
as
trembling
a
state
as
herself
he
gladly
shuffled
her
into
the
hands
of
her
maid
and
scampering
down
stairs
as
if
all
bedlam
were
at
his
heels
sprung
into
his
and
drove
off
like
lightning
when
miss
beaufort
recovered
her
scattered
senses
and
beheld
this
influx
of
persons
entering
her
room
she
tried
to
dispel
her
confusion
and
rising
gently
from
her
seat
while
supporting
herself
on
the
arm
of
miss
dorothy
maid
thanked
the
company
for
their
attention
and
withdrew
into
her
chamber
meanwhile
euphemia
who
had
been
carried
down
into
the
saloon
thought
it
time
to
raise
her
lily
head
and
utter
a
few
incoherent
words
the
instant
they
were
breathed
miss
dundas
and
lascelles
in
one
voice
demanded
what
was
the
matter
has
not
mary
told
you
returned
her
sister
languidly
opening
her
eyes
no
answered
lascelles
rubbing
his
hands
with
delighted
curiosity
come
let
us
have
it
euphemia
pleased
at
this
and
loving
mystery
with
all
her
heart
waved
her
hand
solemnly
and
in
an
awful
tone
replied
then
it
passes
not
my
lips
what
phemy
cried
he
you
want
us
to
believe
you
have
seen
a
ghost
but
you
forget
they
do
walk
at
midday
believe
what
you
like
returned
she
with
an
air
of
consequential
contempt
i
am
satisfied
to
keep
the
secret
miss
dundas
burst
into
a
provoking
laugh
and
calling
her
the
most
incorrigible
little
idiot
in
the
world
encouraged
lascelles
to
fool
her
to
the
top
of
his
bent
determining
to
gratify
his
spleen
if
he
could
not
satisfy
his
curiosity
this
witless
coxcomb
continued
the
whole
day
in
harley
street
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
tormenting
euphemia
from
the
dinner
hour
until
twelve
at
night
neither
his
drowsy
fancy
nor
wakeful
malice
could
find
one
other
weapon
of
assault
than
the
stale
jokes
of
mysterious
chambers
lovers
incognito
or
the
silly
addition
of
two
sweeps
popping
down
the
chimney
to
pay
their
addresses
to
the
fair
friends
diana
talked
of
jupiter
with
his
thunder
and
patting
her
sister
under
the
chin
added
i
can
not
doubt
that
miss
beaufort
is
the
favored
semelé
but
my
dear
you
your
character
as
confidant
a
few
tears
were
enough
when
your
lady
fainted
during
these
attacks
euphemia
reclined
pompously
on
a
sofa
and
not
deigning
a
reply
repelled
them
with
much
conceit
and
haughtiness
miss
beaufort
remained
above
an
hour
alone
in
her
chamber
before
she
ventured
to
go
near
her
aunt
hurt
to
the
soul
that
the
idle
folly
of
euphemia
should
have
aroused
a
terror
which
had
completely
unveiled
to
the
eyes
of
that
inconsiderate
girl
the
empire
which
thaddeus
held
over
her
fate
mary
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
arraigning
her
easy
credulity
threw
herself
on
her
bed
at
hearing
he
was
led
along
the
streets
in
chains
she
could
have
no
other
idea
but
that
betrayed
into
the
commission
of
some
dreadful
deed
he
had
become
amenable
to
the
laws
and
might
suffer
an
ignominious
death
those
thoughts
having
rushed
at
once
on
her
heart
deprived
her
of
in
the
conviction
of
some
fatal
rencontre
she
felt
as
if
her
life
her
honor
her
soul
were
annihilated
and
when
in
consequence
of
her
agonies
euphemia
confessed
that
she
had
in
this
last
matter
told
a
falsehood
the
sudden
peace
to
her
soul
had
for
an
instant
assumed
the
appearance
of
insensibility
before
miss
beaufort
quitted
her
room
various
plans
were
suggested
by
her
anxiety
and
inexperience
how
to
release
the
object
of
her
thoughts
she
found
no
hesitation
in
believing
him
poor
and
perhaps
rendered
wretchedly
so
by
the
burden
of
that
sick
friend
who
she
suspected
might
be
a
near
relation
at
any
rate
she
resolved
that
another
sun
should
not
pass
over
her
head
and
shine
on
him
in
a
prison
having
determined
to
pay
his
debts
herself
she
next
thought
of
how
she
might
manage
the
affair
without
discovering
the
hand
whence
the
assistance
came
had
her
aunt
been
well
enough
to
leave
the
house
she
would
not
have
scrupled
unfolding
to
her
the
recent
calamity
of
constantine
but
well
aware
that
miss
maidenly
nicety
would
be
outraged
at
a
young
woman
appearing
the
sole
mover
in
such
an
affair
she
conceived
herself
obliged
to
withhold
her
confidence
at
present
and
to
decide
on
prosecuting
the
whole
transaction
alone
in
consequence
of
these
meditations
her
spirits
became
less
discomposed
turning
towards
miss
dorothy
somerset
apartments
she
found
the
good
lady
sipping
her
coffee
what
is
this
i
have
just
heard
my
dear
mary
williams
tells
me
you
have
been
ill
miss
beaufort
returned
her
aunt
gracious
inquiry
with
an
affectionate
kiss
and
informing
her
that
she
had
only
been
alarmed
by
an
invention
of
miss
euphemia
begged
that
the
subject
might
drop
it
being
merely
one
out
of
the
many
schemes
which
she
believed
that
young
lady
had
devised
to
render
her
visit
to
london
as
little
pleasant
as
possible
ah
replied
miss
dorothy
i
hope
i
shall
be
well
enough
to
travel
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
i
can
now
walk
with
a
stick
and
upon
my
word
i
am
heartily
tired
both
of
lady
dundas
and
her
daughters
mary
expressed
similar
sentiments
but
as
the
declaration
passed
her
lips
a
sigh
almost
buried
the
last
word
go
when
she
would
she
must
leave
constantine
behind
leave
him
without
an
expectation
of
beholding
him
more
without
a
hope
of
penetrating
the
thick
cloud
which
involved
him
and
with
which
he
had
ever
baffled
any
attempt
she
had
heard
to
discover
his
birth
or
misfortunes
she
wept
over
this
refinement
on
delicacy
and
loved
him
dearer
for
his
mystery
when
the
dawn
broke
next
morning
it
shone
on
miss
beaufort
yet
unclosed
eyes
sleep
could
find
no
languid
faculty
in
her
head
whilst
her
heart
was
agitated
with
plans
for
the
relief
of
thaddeus
the
idea
of
visiting
the
to
which
she
knew
the
misses
dundas
directed
their
letters
and
of
asking
questions
about
a
young
and
handsome
man
made
her
timidity
shrink
but
exclaimed
she
i
am
going
on
an
errand
which
ought
not
to
spread
a
blush
on
the
cheek
of
prudery
itself
i
am
going
to
impart
alleviation
to
the
sufferings
of
the
noblest
creature
that
ever
walked
the
earth
perhaps
there
are
few
persons
who
being
auditors
of
this
speech
would
have
decided
quite
so
candidly
on
the
superlative
by
which
it
was
concluded
mary
herself
was
not
wholly
divested
of
doubt
about
the
issue
of
her
conduct
but
conscious
that
her
motive
was
pure
she
descended
to
the
with
a
quieter
mind
than
countenance
never
before
having
had
occasion
to
throw
a
gloss
on
her
actions
she
scarcely
looked
up
during
breakfast
when
the
cloth
was
removed
she
rose
suddenly
from
her
chair
and
turning
to
miss
dorothy
who
sat
at
the
other
end
of
the
parlor
with
her
foot
on
a
stool
said
in
a
low
voice
aunt
i
am
going
to
make
some
particular
calls
but
i
shall
be
back
in
a
few
hours
luckily
no
one
observed
her
blushing
face
whilst
she
spoke
nor
the
manner
in
which
she
shook
hands
with
the
old
lady
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
breathless
with
confusion
she
could
scarcely
stand
when
she
arrived
in
her
own
chamber
but
aware
that
no
time
ought
to
be
lost
she
tied
on
a
long
light
silk
cloak
of
sober
gray
over
her
white
dress
and
covering
her
head
with
a
straw
summer
bonnet
shaded
by
a
black
lace
veil
hesitated
a
moment
within
her
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
drawn
from
her
heart
by
that
pure
spirit
of
truth
which
had
ever
been
the
guardian
of
her
conduct
looking
up
to
heaven
she
sunk
on
her
knees
and
exclaimed
with
impetuosity
father
of
mercy
thou
only
knowest
my
heart
direct
me
i
beseech
thee
let
me
not
commit
anything
unworthy
of
myself
nor
of
the
unhappy
constantine
for
whom
i
would
sacrifice
my
life
but
not
my
duty
to
thee
reassured
by
the
confidence
which
this
simple
act
of
devotion
inspired
she
took
her
parasol
and
descended
the
stairs
the
porter
was
alone
in
the
hall
she
inquired
for
her
servant
he
is
not
returned
madam
having
foreseen
the
necessity
of
getting
rid
of
all
attendants
she
had
purposely
sent
her
footman
on
an
errand
as
far
as
kensington
it
is
of
no
consequence
returned
she
to
the
porter
who
was
just
going
to
propose
one
of
lady
dundas
men
i
can
not
meet
with
anything
disagreeable
at
this
time
of
day
so
i
shall
walk
alone
the
man
opened
the
door
and
with
a
bounding
heart
mary
hastened
down
the
street
crossed
the
square
and
at
the
bottom
of
orchard
street
stepped
into
a
which
she
ordered
to
drive
to
slaughter
martin
lane
she
drew
up
the
glasses
and
closed
her
eyes
various
thoughts
agitated
her
anxious
mind
whilst
the
carriage
rolled
along
and
when
it
drew
up
at
the
she
involuntarily
retreated
into
the
corner
the
was
opened
will
you
alight
no
call
a
waiter
a
waiter
appeared
and
miss
beaufort
in
a
tolerably
collected
voice
inquired
whether
constantine
lived
there
no
a
cold
dew
stood
on
her
forehead
but
taking
courage
from
a
latent
and
last
hope
she
added
i
know
he
has
had
letters
directed
to
this
place
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
returned
the
man
recollecting
himself
i
remember
a
person
of
that
name
has
received
letters
from
hence
but
they
were
always
fetched
away
by
a
little
girl
and
do
you
not
know
where
he
lives
no
answered
he
yet
some
one
else
in
the
house
may
i
will
inquire
miss
beaufort
bowed
her
head
in
token
of
acknowledgment
and
sat
shivering
with
suspense
until
he
returned
followed
by
another
man
this
person
resumed
he
says
he
can
tell
you
thank
you
thank
you
cried
mary
then
blushing
at
her
eagerness
she
stopped
and
drew
back
into
the
carriage
i
can
not
for
certain
said
the
man
but
i
know
the
girl
very
well
by
sight
who
comes
for
the
letters
and
i
have
often
seen
her
standing
at
the
door
of
a
chandler
shop
a
good
way
down
the
lane
i
think
it
is
no
or
i
sent
a
person
there
who
came
after
the
same
gentleman
about
a
fortnight
ago
i
dare
say
he
lives
there
miss
beaufort
expectations
sunk
again
when
she
found
that
she
had
nothing
but
a
dare
say
to
depend
on
and
giving
to
each
of
her
informers
she
desired
the
coachman
to
drive
as
they
would
direct
him
while
the
carriage
drove
down
the
lane
with
a
heart
full
of
fears
she
looked
from
side
to
side
almost
believing
she
should
know
by
intuition
the
house
which
had
contained
constantine
when
the
man
checked
his
horses
and
her
eyes
fell
on
the
little
mean
dwelling
of
robson
she
smothered
a
deep
sigh
can
this
be
the
house
in
which
constantine
has
lived
how
comfortless
and
should
it
not
thought
she
as
the
man
got
off
the
box
to
inquire
whither
shall
i
go
for
information
the
appearance
of
robson
and
her
immediate
affirmative
to
the
question
are
these
constantine
lodgings
at
once
dispelled
this
last
anxiety
encouraged
by
the
motherly
expression
of
the
good
woman
manner
mary
begged
leave
to
alight
robson
readily
offered
her
arm
and
with
many
apologies
for
the
disordered
state
of
the
house
led
her
up
stairs
to
the
room
which
had
been
the
house
mary
trembled
but
seeing
that
everything
depended
on
with
apparent
tranquillity
she
received
the
chair
that
was
presented
to
her
and
turning
her
eyes
from
the
books
and
drawings
which
told
her
so
truly
in
whose
apartment
she
was
she
desired
robson
who
continued
standing
to
be
seated
the
good
woman
obeyed
after
some
trepidation
mary
asked
where
constantine
was
robson
colored
and
looking
at
her
questioner
for
some
time
as
if
doubting
what
to
say
burst
into
tears
miss
beaufort
ready
eyes
were
much
inclined
to
flow
in
concert
but
subduing
the
strong
emotions
which
shook
her
she
added
i
do
not
come
hither
out
of
impertinent
curiosity
i
have
heard
of
the
misfortunes
of
constantine
i
am
well
known
to
his
friends
dear
lady
cried
the
good
woman
grasping
at
any
prospect
of
succor
to
her
benefactor
if
he
has
friends
whoever
they
are
tell
them
he
is
the
noblest
most
humane
gentleman
in
the
world
tell
them
he
has
saved
me
and
mine
from
the
deepest
want
and
now
he
is
sent
to
prison
because
he
can
not
pay
the
cruel
doctor
who
attended
the
poor
dead
general
what
is
his
friend
dead
ejaculated
mary
unable
to
restrain
the
tears
which
now
streamed
over
her
face
yes
replied
robson
poor
old
gentleman
he
is
dead
sure
enough
and
heaven
knows
many
have
been
the
dreary
hours
the
dear
young
man
has
watched
by
his
pillow
he
died
in
that
room
miss
beaufort
swimming
eyes
would
not
allow
her
to
discern
objects
through
the
open
door
of
that
apartment
within
which
the
heart
of
thaddeus
had
undergone
such
variety
of
misery
forming
an
irresistible
wish
to
know
whether
the
deceased
were
any
relation
of
constantine
she
paused
a
moment
to
compose
the
agitation
which
might
betray
her
and
then
asked
the
question
i
thought
replied
robson
you
said
you
knew
his
friends
only
his
english
ones
returned
mary
a
little
confused
at
the
suspicion
this
answer
implied
i
imagined
that
this
old
gentleman
might
have
been
his
father
or
an
uncle
or
o
no
interrupted
robson
sorrowfully
he
has
neither
father
mother
nor
uncle
in
the
wide
world
he
once
told
me
they
were
all
dead
and
that
he
saw
them
die
alas
sweet
soul
what
a
power
of
griefs
he
must
have
seen
in
his
young
life
but
heaven
will
favor
his
at
last
for
though
he
is
in
misfortune
himself
he
has
been
a
blessing
to
the
widow
and
the
orphan
do
you
know
the
amount
of
his
debts
asked
miss
beaufort
not
more
than
twenty
pounds
returned
robson
when
they
took
him
out
of
this
room
a
week
ago
and
hurried
him
away
without
letting
me
know
a
word
of
the
matter
i
believe
to
this
hour
i
should
not
have
known
where
he
was
if
that
cruel
jackson
had
not
come
to
demand
all
that
constantine
left
in
my
care
but
i
would
not
let
him
have
it
i
told
him
if
my
lodger
had
filled
my
house
with
bags
of
gold
should
not
touch
a
shilling
and
then
he
abused
me
and
told
me
constantine
was
in
newgate
in
newgate
yes
madam
i
immediately
ran
there
and
found
him
more
able
to
comfort
me
than
i
was
able
to
speak
to
him
then
be
at
rest
my
good
woman
returned
miss
beaufort
rising
from
her
chair
when
you
next
hear
of
constantine
he
shall
be
at
liberty
he
has
friends
who
will
not
sleep
till
he
is
out
of
prison
may
heaven
bless
you
and
them
dear
lady
cried
robson
weeping
with
joy
for
they
will
relieve
the
most
generous
heart
alive
but
i
must
tell
you
added
she
with
recollecting
energy
that
the
costs
of
the
business
will
raise
it
to
some
pounds
more
for
that
wicked
jackson
getting
frightened
to
stand
alone
in
what
he
had
done
went
and
persuaded
poor
watson
the
undertaker
to
put
in
a
detainer
against
constantine
for
the
remainder
of
his
bill
so
i
fear
it
will
be
full
thirty
pounds
before
his
kind
friends
can
release
him
mary
replied
be
not
alarmed
all
shall
be
done
while
she
spoke
she
cast
a
wistful
look
on
the
drawings
on
the
bureau
then
withdrawing
her
eyes
with
a
deep
sigh
she
descended
the
stairs
at
the
she
took
robson
hand
and
not
relinquishing
it
until
she
was
seated
in
the
coach
pressed
it
warmly
and
leaving
within
it
a
purse
of
twenty
guineas
ordered
the
man
to
return
whence
he
came
now
that
the
temerity
of
going
herself
to
learn
the
particulars
of
constantine
fate
had
been
achieved
determined
as
she
was
not
to
close
her
eyes
whilst
the
man
whom
she
valued
above
her
life
remained
a
prisoner
and
in
sorrow
she
thought
it
best
to
consult
with
miss
dorothy
respecting
the
speediest
means
of
compassing
his
emancipation
in
oxford
road
she
desired
the
coachman
to
proceed
to
harley
street
she
alighted
at
lady
dundas
door
paid
him
his
fare
and
stepped
into
the
hall
before
she
perceived
that
a
belonging
to
her
guardian
had
driven
away
to
afford
room
for
her
humble
equipage
is
sir
robert
somerset
come
to
town
she
hastily
inquired
of
the
porter
no
madam
but
somerset
is
just
arrived
the
next
minute
miss
beaufort
was
in
the
and
clasped
within
the
arms
of
her
cousin
dear
mary
dear
pembroke
were
the
first
words
which
passed
between
these
two
affectionate
relatives
miss
dorothy
who
doted
on
her
nephew
taking
his
hand
as
he
seated
himself
between
her
and
his
cousin
said
in
a
congratulatory
voice
mary
our
dear
boy
has
come
to
town
purposely
to
take
us
down
yes
indeed
rejoined
he
my
father
is
moped
to
death
for
want
of
you
both
you
know
i
am
a
sad
renegade
lord
avon
and
loftus
have
been
gone
these
ten
days
to
his
lordship
aunt
in
bedfordshire
and
sir
robert
is
so
completely
weary
of
solitude
that
he
has
commanded
me
bowing
to
the
other
ladies
to
run
off
with
all
the
fair
inhabitants
of
this
house
sooner
than
leave
you
behind
i
shall
be
happy
at
another
opportunity
to
visit
somerset
hall
returned
lady
dundas
but
i
am
constrained
to
spend
this
summer
in
dumbartonshire
i
have
not
yet
seen
the
estate
my
poor
dear
sir
hector
bought
of
the
duke
of
dunbar
pembroke
offered
no
attempt
to
shake
this
resolution
in
the
two
or
three
morning
calls
he
had
formerly
made
with
sir
robert
somerset
on
the
rich
widow
he
saw
sufficient
to
make
him
regard
her
arrogant
vulgarity
with
disgust
and
for
her
daughters
they
were
of
too
artificial
a
stamp
to
occupy
his
mind
any
longer
than
with
a
lantern
impression
of
a
tall
woman
with
bold
eyes
and
the
prettiest
yet
most
affected
little
fairy
he
had
ever
beheld
after
half
an
hour
conversation
with
this
family
group
miss
beaufort
sunk
into
abstraction
during
the
first
month
of
acquaintance
with
thaddeus
she
did
not
neglect
to
mention
in
her
correspondence
with
pembroke
having
met
with
a
very
interesting
and
accomplished
emigrant
in
the
capacity
of
a
tutor
at
lady
dundas
but
her
cousin
in
his
replies
beginning
to
banter
her
on
pity
being
allied
to
love
she
had
gradually
dropped
all
mention
of
constantine
name
as
she
too
truly
found
by
what
insensible
degrees
the
union
had
taken
place
within
her
own
breast
she
remembered
these
particulars
whilst
a
new
method
of
accomplishing
her
present
project
suggested
itself
and
determining
however
extraordinary
her
conduct
might
seem
to
rest
on
the
rectitude
of
her
motives
a
man
being
the
most
proper
person
to
transact
such
a
business
with
propriety
she
resolved
to
engage
pembroke
for
her
agent
without
troubling
miss
dorothy
about
the
affair
so
deeply
was
she
absorbed
in
these
reflections
that
somerset
observing
her
vacant
eye
fixed
on
the
opposite
window
took
her
hand
with
an
arch
smile
and
exclaimed
mary
what
is
the
matter
i
hope
lady
dundas
you
have
not
suffered
any
one
to
run
away
with
her
heart
you
know
i
am
her
cousin
and
it
is
my
inalienable
right
lady
dundas
replied
that
young
ladies
best
know
their
own
secrets
that
may
be
madam
rejoined
he
but
i
wo
allow
miss
beaufort
to
know
anything
that
she
does
not
transfer
to
me
is
not
that
true
mary
yes
whispered
she
coloring
and
the
sooner
you
afford
me
an
opportunity
to
interest
you
in
one
the
more
i
shall
be
obliged
to
you
pembroke
pressed
her
hand
in
token
of
assent
and
a
desultory
conversation
continuing
for
another
miss
beaufort
who
dreaded
the
wasting
one
minute
in
a
day
so
momentous
to
her
peace
sat
uneasily
until
her
aunt
proposed
retiring
to
her
a
while
and
requested
pembroke
to
assist
her
up
stairs
when
he
returned
to
the
to
his
extreme
satisfaction
he
found
all
the
party
were
gone
to
prepare
for
their
usual
drives
excepting
miss
beaufort
who
was
standing
by
one
of
the
windows
lost
in
thought
he
approached
her
and
taking
her
hand
come
my
dear
cousin
said
he
how
can
i
oblige
you
mary
struggled
with
her
confusion
had
she
loved
thaddeus
less
she
found
she
could
with
greater
ease
have
related
the
interest
which
she
took
in
his
fate
she
tried
to
speak
distinctly
and
she
accomplished
it
although
her
burning
cheek
and
downcast
look
told
to
the
fixed
eye
of
pembroke
what
she
vainly
attempted
to
conceal
you
can
indeed
oblige
me
you
must
remember
a
constantine
i
once
mentioned
him
to
you
in
my
letters
i
do
mary
you
thought
him
amiable
he
was
the
intimate
friend
of
lady
tinemouth
returned
she
striving
to
look
up
but
the
piercing
expression
she
met
from
the
eyes
of
somerset
beating
hers
down
again
covered
her
face
and
neck
with
deeper
blushes
she
panted
for
breath
rely
on
me
said
pembroke
pitying
her
embarrassment
whilst
he
dreaded
that
her
gentle
heart
had
indeed
become
the
victim
of
some
accomplished
and
insidious
foreigner
rely
on
me
my
beloved
cousin
consider
me
as
a
brother
if
you
have
entangled
yourself
miss
beaufort
guessed
what
he
would
say
and
interrupting
him
added
with
a
more
assured
air
no
pembroke
i
have
no
entanglements
i
am
going
to
ask
your
friendly
assistance
on
behalf
of
a
brave
and
unfortunate
polander
pembroke
reddened
and
she
went
on
constantine
is
a
gentleman
lady
tinemouth
tells
me
he
has
been
a
soldier
and
that
he
lost
all
his
possessions
in
the
ruin
of
his
country
her
ladyship
introduced
him
here
i
have
seen
him
often
and
i
know
him
to
be
worthy
the
esteem
of
every
honorable
heart
he
is
now
in
prison
in
newgate
for
a
debt
of
about
thirty
pounds
and
i
ask
you
to
go
and
release
him
that
is
my
request
my
secret
and
i
confide
in
your
discretion
that
you
will
keep
it
even
from
him
generous
beloved
mary
cried
pembroke
pressing
her
hand
it
is
thus
you
always
act
possessed
of
all
the
softness
of
thy
sex
dearest
girl
added
he
still
more
affectionately
nature
has
not
alloyed
it
with
one
particle
of
weakness
miss
beaufort
smiled
and
sighed
if
to
love
tenderly
to
be
devoted
life
and
soul
to
one
being
whom
she
considered
as
the
most
perfect
work
of
creation
be
weakness
mary
was
the
weakest
of
the
weak
and
with
a
languid
despondence
at
her
heart
she
was
opening
her
lips
to
give
some
directions
to
her
cousin
when
the
attention
of
both
was
arrested
by
a
shrill
noise
of
speakers
talking
above
stairs
before
the
cousins
had
time
to
make
an
observation
the
disputants
descended
towards
the
and
bursting
open
the
door
with
a
violent
clamor
presented
the
enraged
figure
of
lady
dundas
followed
by
diana
who
with
a
no
less
swollen
countenance
was
scolding
vociferously
and
dragging
forward
the
weeping
euphemia
ladies
ladies
exclaimed
somerset
amazed
at
so
extraordinary
a
scene
what
has
happened
lady
dundas
lifted
up
her
clenched
hand
in
a
passion
a
jade
a
hussy
cried
her
vulgar
ladyship
incapable
of
articulating
more
miss
dundas
still
grasping
the
hands
of
her
struggling
sister
broke
out
next
and
turning
furiously
towards
mary
exclaimed
you
see
madam
what
disgrace
your
ridiculous
conduct
to
that
vagabond
foreigner
has
brought
on
our
family
this
bad
girl
has
followed
your
example
and
done
has
fallen
in
love
with
him
shocked
and
trembling
at
so
rude
an
accusation
miss
beaufort
was
unable
to
speak
lost
in
wonder
and
incensed
at
his
goodness
having
been
the
dupe
of
imposition
pembroke
stood
silent
whilst
lady
dundas
took
up
the
subject
ay
cried
she
shaking
her
daughter
by
the
shoulder
you
little
minx
if
your
sister
had
not
picked
up
these
abominable
verses
you
chose
to
write
on
the
absence
of
this
beggarly
fellow
i
suppose
you
would
have
finished
the
business
by
running
off
with
him
but
you
shall
go
down
to
scotland
and
be
locked
up
for
months
i
wo
have
sir
hector
dundas
family
disgraced
by
a
daughter
of
mine
for
pity
sake
lady
dundas
said
pembroke
stepping
between
her
shrewish
ladyship
and
the
trembling
euphemia
do
compose
yourself
i
dare
say
your
daughter
is
pardonable
in
these
cases
the
fault
in
general
lies
with
our
sex
we
are
the
deluders
mary
was
obliged
to
reseat
herself
and
in
pale
attention
she
listened
for
the
reply
of
the
affrighted
euphemia
who
half
assured
that
her
whim
of
creating
a
mutual
passion
in
the
breast
of
thaddeus
was
no
longer
tenable
without
either
shame
or
remorse
she
exclaimed
indeed
somerset
you
are
right
i
never
should
have
thought
of
constantine
if
he
had
not
teased
me
every
time
he
came
with
his
devoted
love
miss
beaufort
rose
hastily
from
her
chair
though
euphemia
colored
at
the
suddenness
of
this
motion
and
the
immediate
flash
she
met
from
her
eye
she
went
on
i
know
miss
beaufort
will
deny
it
because
she
thinks
he
is
in
love
with
her
but
indeed
indeed
he
has
sworn
a
thousand
times
on
his
knees
that
he
was
a
russian
nobleman
in
disguise
and
adored
me
above
every
one
else
in
the
world
villain
cried
pembroke
inflamed
with
indignation
at
his
double
conduct
afraid
to
read
in
the
expressive
countenance
of
mary
her
shame
and
horror
at
this
discovery
he
turned
his
eyes
on
her
with
trepidation
when
to
his
surprise
he
beheld
her
standing
perfectly
unmoved
by
the
side
of
the
sofa
from
which
she
had
arisen
she
advanced
with
a
calm
step
towards
euphemia
and
taking
hold
of
the
hand
which
concealed
her
face
whilst
uttering
this
last
falsehood
she
drew
it
away
and
regarding
her
with
a
serene
but
penetrating
look
she
said
euphemia
you
well
know
that
you
are
slandering
an
innocent
and
unfortunate
man
you
know
that
never
in
his
life
did
he
give
you
the
slightest
reason
to
suppose
that
he
was
attached
to
you
for
myself
i
can
also
clear
him
of
making
professions
to
me
upon
the
honor
of
my
word
i
declare
added
she
addressing
herself
to
the
whole
group
that
he
never
breathed
a
sentence
to
me
beyond
mere
respect
by
this
last
deviation
of
euphemia
from
truth
you
may
form
an
estimate
how
far
the
rest
she
has
alleged
deserves
credit
the
young
lady
burst
into
a
vehement
passion
of
tears
i
will
not
be
browbeaten
and
insulted
miss
beaufort
cried
she
taking
refuge
in
noise
since
right
had
deserted
her
you
know
you
would
fight
his
battles
through
thick
and
thin
else
you
would
not
have
fallen
into
fits
yesterday
when
i
told
you
he
was
sent
to
jail
this
last
assault
struck
mary
motionless
and
lady
dundas
lifting
up
her
hands
exclaimed
good
la
keep
me
from
the
forward
misses
of
these
times
as
for
you
miss
euphemia
added
she
seizing
her
daughter
by
the
arm
you
shall
leave
town
tomorrow
morning
i
will
have
no
more
tutoring
and
falling
in
love
in
my
house
and
for
you
miss
beaufort
turning
to
mary
who
having
recovered
herself
stood
calmly
at
a
little
distance
i
shall
take
care
to
warn
miss
dorothy
somerset
to
keep
an
eye
over
your
conduct
madam
replied
she
indignantly
i
shall
never
do
anything
which
can
dishonor
either
my
family
or
myself
and
of
that
miss
dorothy
somerset
is
too
well
assured
to
doubt
for
an
instant
even
should
calumny
be
as
busy
with
me
as
it
has
been
injurious
to
mr
constantine
with
the
words
of
robson
suddenly
reverberating
on
her
heart
he
has
no
father
no
mother
no
kindred
in
this
wide
world
she
walked
towards
the
door
when
she
passed
somerset
who
stood
bewildered
and
frowning
near
miss
dundas
she
turned
her
eyes
on
her
cousin
full
of
the
effulgent
pity
in
her
soul
and
said
in
a
collected
and
decisive
voice
pembroke
i
shall
leave
the
room
but
remember
i
do
not
release
you
from
your
engagement
staggered
by
the
open
firmness
of
her
manner
he
looked
after
her
as
she
withdrew
and
was
almost
inclined
to
believe
that
she
possessed
the
right
side
of
the
argument
malice
did
not
allow
him
to
think
so
long
the
moment
the
door
closed
on
her
both
the
sisters
fell
on
him
and
the
prejudiced
illiberality
of
the
one
supported
by
the
ready
falsehoods
of
the
other
soon
dislodged
all
favorable
impressions
from
the
mind
of
somerset
and
filled
him
anew
with
displeasure
in
the
midst
of
diana
third
harangue
lady
dundas
having
ordered
euphemia
to
be
taken
to
her
chamber
somerset
was
left
alone
more
incensed
than
ever
against
the
object
of
their
invectives
whom
he
now
considered
in
the
light
of
an
adventurer
concealing
his
poverty
and
perhaps
his
crimes
beneath
a
garb
of
lies
that
such
a
character
by
means
of
a
fine
person
and
a
few
meretricious
talents
could
work
himself
into
the
confidence
of
mary
beaufort
pierced
her
cousin
to
the
soul
and
as
he
mounted
the
stairs
with
an
intent
to
seek
her
in
her
he
almost
resolved
to
refuse
obeying
her
commands
when
he
opened
the
he
found
miss
beaufort
and
his
aunt
the
instant
he
appeared
the
face
of
miss
dorothy
contracted
into
a
frown
nephew
cried
she
i
shall
not
take
it
well
of
you
if
you
give
stronger
credence
to
the
passionate
and
vulgar
assertions
of
lady
dundas
and
her
daughters
than
you
choose
to
bestow
on
the
tried
veracity
of
your
cousin
mary
pembroke
was
conscious
that
if
his
countenance
had
been
a
faithful
transcript
of
his
mind
miss
beaufort
did
not
err
in
supposing
he
believed
the
foreigner
to
be
a
villain
knowing
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
relinquish
his
reason
into
what
he
now
denominated
the
partial
hands
of
his
aunt
and
cousin
he
persisted
in
his
opinion
to
both
the
ladies
that
their
unsuspicious
natures
had
been
rendered
subservient
to
knavery
and
artifice
i
would
not
my
dear
madam
said
he
addressing
miss
dorothy
think
so
meanly
of
your
sex
as
to
imagine
that
such
atrocity
can
exist
in
the
female
heart
as
could
give
birth
to
ruinous
and
unprovoked
calumnies
against
an
innocent
man
i
can
not
suspect
the
misses
dundas
of
such
needless
guilt
particularly
poor
euphemia
whom
i
truly
pity
lady
dundas
forced
me
to
read
her
verses
and
they
were
too
full
of
love
and
regret
for
this
adventurer
to
come
from
the
same
breast
which
could
wantonly
blacken
his
character
such
wicked
inconsistencies
in
so
young
a
woman
are
not
half
so
probable
as
that
you
my
clear
aunt
and
cousin
have
been
deceived
nephew
returned
the
old
lady
you
are
very
peremptory
methinks
a
little
more
lenity
of
opinion
would
better
become
your
youth
i
knew
nothing
of
this
unhappy
young
man
present
distress
until
miss
beaufort
mentioned
it
to
me
but
before
she
breathed
a
word
in
his
favor
i
had
conceived
a
very
high
respect
for
his
merits
from
the
first
hour
in
which
i
saw
him
i
gathered
by
his
deportment
that
he
must
be
a
gentleman
besides
a
previous
act
of
benevolent
bravery
in
rescuing
at
the
hazard
of
his
own
life
two
poor
children
from
a
house
in
flames
in
all
this
i
saw
he
must
have
been
born
far
above
his
fortunes
i
thought
so
i
still
think
so
and
notwithstanding
all
that
the
dundasses
may
choose
to
fabricate
i
am
determined
to
believe
the
assertions
of
an
honest
countenance
pembroke
smiled
whilst
he
forced
his
aunt
reluctant
hand
into
his
and
said
i
see
my
dear
madam
you
are
bigoted
to
the
idol
of
your
own
fancy
i
do
not
presume
to
doubt
this
constantine
lucky
exploits
nor
his
enchantments
but
you
must
pardon
me
if
i
keep
my
senses
at
liberty
i
shall
think
of
him
as
i
could
almost
swear
he
deserves
although
i
am
aware
that
i
hazard
your
affection
by
my
firmness
he
then
turned
to
mary
who
with
a
swelling
and
distressed
heart
was
standing
by
the
chimney
forgive
me
my
dearest
cousin
continued
he
addressing
her
in
a
softened
voice
that
i
am
forced
to
appear
harsh
it
is
the
first
time
i
ever
dissented
from
you
it
is
the
first
time
i
ever
thought
you
prejudiced
miss
beaufort
drew
the
back
of
her
hand
over
her
glistening
eyes
all
the
tender
affections
of
pembroke
bosom
smote
him
at
once
and
throwing
his
arms
around
his
cousin
waist
he
strained
her
to
his
breast
and
added
ah
why
dear
girl
must
i
love
you
better
for
thus
giving
me
pain
every
way
my
darling
mary
is
more
estimable
even
now
whilst
i
oppose
you
i
am
sure
though
your
goodness
is
abused
it
was
cheated
into
error
by
the
affectation
of
honorable
impulses
and
disasters
miss
beaufort
thought
that
if
the
prudence
of
reserve
and
decorum
dictated
silence
in
some
circumstances
in
others
a
prudence
of
a
higher
order
would
justify
her
in
declaring
her
sentiments
accordingly
she
withdrew
from
the
clasping
arms
of
somerset
and
whilst
her
beautiful
figure
seemed
to
dilate
into
more
than
its
usual
dignity
she
mildly
replied
think
what
you
please
pembroke
i
shall
not
contend
with
you
constantine
is
of
a
nature
not
to
be
hidden
by
obscurity
his
character
will
defend
itself
and
all
that
i
have
to
add
is
this
i
do
not
release
you
from
your
promise
could
a
woman
transact
the
affair
with
propriety
i
would
not
keep
yon
to
so
disagreeable
an
office
but
i
have
passed
my
word
to
myself
that
i
will
neither
slumber
nor
sleep
till
he
is
out
of
prison
she
put
a
into
pembroke
hand
and
added
take
that
my
clear
cousin
and
without
suffering
a
syllable
to
transpire
by
which
he
may
suspect
who
served
him
accomplish
what
i
have
desired
acting
by
the
memorandum
you
will
find
within
i
will
obey
you
mary
returned
he
but
i
am
sorry
that
such
rare
enthusiasm
was
not
awakened
by
a
worthier
object
when
you
see
me
again
i
hope
i
shall
be
enabled
to
say
that
your
generosity
is
satisfied
fie
nephew
fie
cried
miss
dorothy
i
could
not
have
supposed
you
capable
of
conferring
a
favor
so
ungraciously
pained
at
what
he
called
the
obstinate
infatuation
of
miss
beaufort
and
if
possible
more
chagrined
by
what
he
considered
the
blind
and
absurd
encouragement
of
his
aunt
somerset
lost
the
whole
of
her
last
reprimand
in
his
hurry
to
quit
the
room
disturbed
displeased
and
anxious
he
stepped
into
a
and
ordering
it
to
drive
to
newgate
called
on
the
way
at
inn
to
take
up
a
confidential
clerk
of
his
father
there
determining
by
his
assistance
to
go
through
the
business
without
exposing
himself
to
any
interview
with
a
man
whom
he
believed
to
be
an
artful
and
unprincipled
villain
chapter

calumny
is
the
pastime
of
little
minds
and
the
venomed
shaft
of
base
ones
the
first
week
of
the
count
confinement
was
rendered
in
some
degree
tolerable
by
the
daily
visits
of
robson
who
having
brought
his
drawing
materials
enabled
him
through
the
means
of
the
always
punctual
printseller
to
purchase
some
civility
from
the
brutal
and
hardened
people
who
were
his
keepers
after
the
good
woman
had
performed
her
diurnal
kindness
thaddeus
did
not
suffer
his
eyes
to
turn
one
moment
on
the
dismal
loneliness
of
his
abject
prison
but
took
up
his
pencil
to
accomplish
its
daily
task
and
when
done
he
opened
some
one
of
his
books
which
had
also
been
brought
to
him
and
so
sought
to
beguile
his
almost
hopeless
hours
hopeless
with
regard
to
any
human
hope
of
ever
those
incarcerating
walls
for
who
was
there
but
those
who
had
put
him
there
who
could
now
know
even
of
his
existence
the
elasticity
and
pressing
enterprise
of
soul
inherent
in
worth
renders
no
calamity
so
difficult
to
be
borne
as
that
which
betters
its
best
years
and
most
active
virtues
under
the
lock
of
any
captivity
thaddeus
felt
this
benumbing
effect
in
every
pulse
of
his
ardent
and
energetic
heart
he
retraced
all
that
he
had
been
he
looked
on
what
he
was
though
he
had
reaped
glory
when
a
boy
his
noon
of
manhood
his
evening
sun
was
to
waste
its
light
and
set
in
an
english
prison
at
short
and
distant
intervals
such
melancholy
reveries
gave
place
to
the
pitying
image
of
mary
beaufort
it
sometimes
visited
him
in
the
day
it
always
was
his
companion
during
the
night
he
courted
her
lovely
ideal
as
a
spell
that
for
a
while
stole
him
from
painful
reflections
with
an
entranced
soul
he
recalled
every
lineament
of
her
angel
like
face
every
tender
sympathy
of
that
gentle
voice
which
had
hurried
him
into
the
rashness
of
touching
her
hand
one
moment
he
pressed
her
gold
chain
closer
to
his
heart
almost
believing
what
lady
tinemouth
had
insinuated
the
next
he
would
sigh
over
his
credulity
and
return
with
despondent
though
equally
intense
love
to
the
contemplation
of
her
virtues
independent
of
himself
the
more
he
meditated
on
the
purity
of
her
manners
the
elevated
principles
to
which
he
could
trace
her
actions
and
above
all
on
the
benevolent
confidence
with
which
she
had
ever
treated
him
a
man
contemned
by
one
part
of
her
acquaintance
and
merely
received
on
trust
by
the
remainder
the
more
he
found
reasons
to
regard
that
character
with
his
grateful
admiration
when
he
drew
a
comparison
between
miss
beaufort
and
most
women
of
the
same
quality
whom
he
had
seen
in
england
and
in
other
countries
he
contemplated
with
delighted
wonder
that
spotless
mind
which
having
passed
through
the
various
ordeals
annexed
to
wealth
and
fashion
still
bore
itself
uncontaminated
she
was
beautiful
and
she
did
not
regard
it
she
was
accomplished
but
she
did
not
attempt
a
display
what
she
acquired
from
education
the
graces
had
so
incorporated
with
her
native
intelligence
that
the
perfection
of
her
character
seemed
to
have
been
stamped
at
once
by
the
beneficent
hand
of
providence
never
were
her
numberless
attractions
so
fascinating
to
thaddeus
as
when
he
witnessed
the
generous
eagerness
with
which
forgetful
of
her
own
almost
unparalleled
talents
she
pointed
out
merit
and
dispensed
applause
to
the
deserving
miss
beaufort
nature
was
gentle
and
benevolent
but
it
was
likewise
distinguishing
and
animated
whilst
the
count
saw
that
the
urbanity
of
her
disposition
made
her
politeness
universal
he
perceived
that
neither
rank
riches
nor
splendor
when
alone
could
extract
from
her
bosom
one
spark
of
that
lambet
flame
which
streamed
from
her
heart
like
fire
to
the
sun
towards
the
united
glory
of
genius
and
virtue
he
dwelt
on
her
lovely
unsophisticated
character
with
an
enthusiasm
bordering
on
idolatry
he
recollected
that
she
had
been
educated
by
the
mother
of
pembroke
somerset
and
turning
from
the
double
remembrance
with
a
sigh
fraught
with
all
the
bitterness
and
sweetness
of
love
he
acknowledged
how
much
wisdom
which
includes
virtue
gives
spirit
and
immortality
to
beauty
yes
cried
he
it
is
the
fragrance
of
the
flower
which
lives
after
the
bloom
is
withered
from
such
reflections
of
various
hues
thaddeus
was
one
evening
awakened
by
the
entrance
of
the
chief
jailer
into
his
cell
his
was
an
unusual
visit
he
presented
a
sealed
packet
to
his
prisoner
saying
he
brought
it
from
a
stranger
who
having
paid
the
debts
and
costs
for
which
he
was
confined
and
all
the
prison
dues
had
immediately
gone
away
leaving
that
packet
to
be
instantly
delivered
into
the
hand
of
constantine
while
thaddeus
scarcely
crediting
the
information
was
hastily
opening
the
packet
hoping
it
might
throw
some
light
on
his
benefactor
the
jailer
civilly
withdrew
but
the
breaking
of
the
seal
discovered
a
blank
cover
only
save
these
words
in
a
handwriting
unknown
to
him
you
are
free
and
bank
of
england
notes
to
the
amount
of
fifty
pounds
overwhelmed
with
surprise
gratitude
to
heaven
and
to
this
generous
unknown
he
sank
down
into
his
solitary
chair
and
tried
to
conjecture
who
could
have
acted
the
part
of
such
a
friend
and
yet
be
so
careful
to
conceal
that
act
of
friendship
he
had
seen
sufficient
proofs
of
a
heedless
want
of
benevolence
in
miss
euphemia
dundas
to
lead
him
to
suppose
that
she
could
not
be
so
munificent
and
solicitous
of
secrecy
besides
how
could
she
have
learned
his
situation
he
thought
it
was
impossible
and
that
impossibility
compelled
an
erratic
hope
of
his
present
liberty
having
sprung
from
the
goodness
of
miss
beaufort
to
pass
by
him
with
a
painful
swiftness
alas
cried
he
starting
from
his
chair
it
is
the
indefatigable
spirit
of
lady
sara
ross
that
i
recognize
in
this
deed
the
generous
but
unhappy
interest
which
she
yet
takes
in
my
fate
has
discovered
my
last
misfortune
and
thus
she
seeks
to
relieve
me
the
moment
he
conceived
this
idea
he
believed
it
and
taking
up
a
pen
with
a
grateful
though
disturbed
soul
he
addressed
to
her
the
following
guarded
note
to
the
right
honorable
lady
sara
ross
an
unfortunate
exile
who
is
already
overpowered
by
a
sense
of
not
having
deserved
the
notice
which
lady
sara
ross
has
deigned
to
take
of
his
misfortunes
was
this
day
liberated
from
prison
in
a
manner
so
generous
and
delicate
that
he
can
ascribe
the
act
to
no
other
than
the
noble
heart
of
her
ladyship
the
object
of
this
bounty
bending
under
a
weight
of
obligations
which
he
can
not
repay
begs
permission
to
the
bills
which
lady
sara
agent
transmitted
to
him
but
as
the
deed
which
procures
his
freedom
can
not
be
recalled
with
the
most
grateful
emotions
he
accepts
that
new
instance
of
her
ladyship
goodness
thaddeus
was
on
the
point
of
asking
one
of
the
turnkeys
to
send
him
some
trusty
person
to
take
this
letter
to
james
place
when
recollecting
the
impropriety
of
making
any
inmate
of
newgate
his
messenger
to
lady
sara
he
was
determining
to
remove
immediately
to
martin
lane
and
thence
dispatch
his
packet
to
his
generous
friend
when
robson
herself
was
announced
by
his
turnkey
who
as
customary
disappeared
the
moment
he
had
let
her
in
she
hastened
forward
to
him
with
an
animated
countenance
and
exclaimed
before
he
had
time
to
speak
dear
sir
i
have
seen
a
dear
sweet
lady
who
has
promised
me
not
to
sleep
till
you
are
out
of
this
horrid
place
the
suspicions
of
the
count
that
his
benefactress
was
indeed
lady
sara
ross
were
now
confirmed
seating
his
warmhearted
landlady
in
the
only
chair
his
apartment
contained
to
satisfy
her
humility
he
took
his
station
on
the
table
and
then
said
the
lady
has
already
fulfilled
her
engagement
i
am
free
and
i
only
wait
for
a
coach
which
i
shall
send
for
immediately
to
take
me
back
to
your
kind
home
at
this
assurance
the
delighted
robson
crying
and
laughing
by
turns
did
not
cease
her
ejaculations
of
joy
until
the
turnkey
whom
he
had
recalled
to
give
the
order
for
the
coach
returned
to
say
that
it
was
in
readiness
he
took
up
his
late
prisoner
small
portmanteau
with
the
materials
which
had
been
brought
to
him
during
his
incarceration
and
thaddeus
with
a
feeling
as
if
a
band
of
iron
had
been
taken
from
his
soul
passed
through
the
door
of
his
cell
and
when
he
reached
the
greater
portal
of
newgate
where
the
coach
stood
he
gave
the
turnkey
a
liberal
and
handing
robson
into
the
vehicle
stepped
in
after
her
full
of
thankfulness
to
heaven
for
again
being
permitted
to
taste
the
wholesome
breeze
of
a
free
atmosphere
they
drove
quickly
on
and
from
the
fullness
of
his
thoughts
little
passed
between
the
count
and
his
happy
companion
till
they
alighted
at
her
door
and
he
had
his
humble
apartment
but
so
true
is
it
that
advantages
are
only
appreciated
by
comparison
when
he
looked
around
he
considered
it
a
palace
of
luxury
compared
to
the
stifling
dungeon
he
had
left
ah
cried
robson
pointing
to
a
chair
there
is
the
seat
in
which
that
dear
lady
sat
sweet
creature
i
if
i
had
known
i
durst
believe
all
she
promised
i
would
have
fallen
on
my
knees
and
kissed
her
feet
for
bringing
back
your
dear
self
i
thank
you
my
revered
friend
replied
thaddeus
with
a
grateful
smile
and
a
tear
at
so
ardent
a
demonstration
of
her
maternal
affection
but
where
is
little
nanny
that
i
may
shake
hands
with
her
it
being
yet
early
in
the
evening
he
was
also
anxious
before
the
probable
retiring
time
of
lady
sara
into
her
to
prepare
for
dinner
should
elapse
to
dispatch
his
letter
to
her
and
he
inquired
of
his
still
rejoicing
landlady
whether
she
could
find
him
a
safe
porter
to
take
a
small
packet
of
importance
to
place
and
wait
for
an
answer
the
good
woman
instantly
replied
that
watts
her
neighbor
had
a
nephew
at
present
lodging
with
her
a
steady
man
recently
made
one
of
the
grooms
in
the
king
mews
and
as
this
was
the
customary
hour
of
his
return
from
the
stables
she
was
sure
he
would
be
glad
to
do
the
service
while
the
count
was
sealing
his
letter
mrs
robson
had
executed
her
commission
and
reentered
with
young
watts
he
respectfully
received
his
instructions
from
thaddeus
and
withdrew
to
perform
the
duty
nanny
had
also
appeared
and
welcomed
her
grandmother
beloved
lodger
with
all
those
artless
and
animated
expressions
of
joy
which
are
inseparable
from
a
good
and
unsophisticated
heart
the
distance
between
the
royal
precincts
of
james
and
the
unostentatious
environs
of
martin
church
being
very
short
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
count
messenger
returned
with
the
reply
it
was
with
pain
that
he
opened
it
for
he
saw
by
the
state
of
the
paper
that
it
had
been
blotted
with
tears
he
hurriedly
took
out
the
bills
with
a
flushed
cheek
and
read
as
follows
i
can
not
be
mistaken
in
recognizing
the
proud
and
constantine
in
the
lines
i
hold
in
my
hand
could
anything
have
imparted
to
me
more
comfort
than
your
generous
belief
that
there
is
indeed
some
virtue
left
in
my
wretched
and
repentant
heart
it
would
have
arisen
from
the
consciousness
of
having
been
the
happy
person
who
succored
you
in
your
distress
but
no
that
enjoyment
was
beyond
my
deserving
the
bliss
of
being
the
lightener
of
your
sorrows
was
reserved
by
heaven
for
a
less
criminal
creature
i
did
not
even
know
that
you
were
in
prison
since
our
dreadful
parting
i
have
never
dared
to
inquire
after
you
and
much
as
it
might
console
me
to
serve
one
so
truly
valued
i
will
not
insult
your
nice
honor
by
offering
any
further
instance
of
my
friendship
than
what
will
evince
my
gratitude
to
your
prayers
and
my
acquiescence
with
the
commands
of
duty
my
husband
is
here
without
perceiving
the
ravages
which
misery
and
remorse
have
made
in
my
unhappy
heart
time
perhaps
may
render
me
less
unworthy
of
his
tenderness
at
present
i
detest
myself
i
return
the
bills
you
may
safely
use
them
for
they
never
were
mine
the
noble
heart
of
thaddeus
bled
over
every
line
of
this
letter
he
saw
that
it
bore
the
stamp
of
truth
which
did
not
leave
him
a
moment
in
doubt
that
he
owed
his
release
to
some
other
hand
whilst
he
folded
it
up
his
grateful
suspicions
next
lighted
on
lady
tinemouth
he
had
received
one
short
letter
from
her
since
her
departure
mentioning
sophia
stay
in
town
to
meet
montresor
and
miss
beaufort
detention
there
on
account
of
miss
dorothy
accident
and
closing
with
the
intelligence
of
her
own
arrival
at
the
wolds
he
was
struck
with
the
idea
that
as
he
had
delayed
answering
this
letter
in
consequence
of
his
late
embarrassment
she
must
have
made
inquiries
after
him
that
probably
miss
egerton
was
the
lady
who
had
visited
robson
and
finding
the
information
true
had
executed
the
countess
commission
to
obtain
his
release
according
to
these
suppositions
he
questioned
his
landlady
about
the
appearance
of
the
lady
who
had
called
replied
she
was
of
an
elegant
height
but
so
wrapped
up
i
could
neither
see
her
face
nor
her
figure
though
i
am
certain
from
the
softness
of
her
voice
she
must
be
both
young
and
handsome
sweet
creature
i
am
sure
she
wept
two
or
three
times
besides
she
is
the
most
charitable
soul
alive
next
to
you
sir
for
she
gave
me
a
purse
with
twenty
guineas
and
she
told
me
she
knew
your
honor
english
friends
this
narration
substantiating
his
hope
of
lady
tinemouth
being
his
benefactress
that
the
kind
sophia
was
her
agent
and
the
gentleman
who
defrayed
the
debt
montresor
he
felt
easier
under
an
obligation
which
a
mysterious
liberation
would
have
doubled
he
knew
the
countess
maternal
love
for
him
to
reject
her
present
benefaction
in
any
part
would
be
to
sacrifice
gratitude
to
an
excessive
and
haughty
delicacy
convinced
that
nothing
can
be
great
that
it
is
great
to
despise
he
no
longer
hesitated
to
accept
lady
tinemouth
bounty
but
smothered
in
his
breast
the
embers
of
a
proud
and
repulsive
fire
which
having
burst
forth
in
the
first
hour
of
his
misfortunes
was
ever
ready
to
consume
any
attempt
that
might
oppress
him
with
the
weight
of
obligation
being
exhausted
by
the
events
of
the
day
he
retired
at
an
early
hour
to
his
grateful
devotions
and
to
his
pillow
where
he
found
that
repose
which
he
had
sought
in
vain
within
the
gloomy
and
he
supposed
walls
of
his
prison
in
the
morning
he
was
awakened
by
the
light
footsteps
of
his
pretty
entering
the
front
room
his
being
open
he
asked
her
what
the
hour
was
she
replied
nine
adding
that
she
had
brought
a
letter
which
one
of
the
waiters
from
had
just
left
with
information
that
he
did
so
by
the
orders
of
a
footman
in
a
rich
livery
thaddeus
desired
that
it
might
be
given
to
him
the
child
obeyed
and
quitted
the
room
he
saw
that
the
superscription
was
in
miss
hand
and
opening
it
with
pleasure
because
everything
interested
him
which
came
from
the
house
which
contained
mary
beaufort
to
his
amazement
and
consternation
he
read
the
following
accusations
to
constantine
sir
by
a
miraculous
circumstance
yesterday
morning
your
deep
and
daring
plan
of
villany
has
been
discovered
to
lady
d
myself
the
deluded
victim
whom
your
arts
and
falsehoods
would
have
seduced
to
dishonor
her
family
by
connecting
herself
with
a
vagabond
has
at
length
seen
through
her
error
and
now
detests
you
as
much
as
ever
your
insufferable
presumption
could
have
hoped
she
would
distinguish
you
with
her
regard
thanks
be
to
heaven
you
are
completely
exposed
this
young
woman
of
fashion
whose
name
i
will
not
trust
in
the
same
page
with
yours
has
made
a
full
confession
of
your
vile
seductions
of
her
own
reprehensible
weakness
in
ever
having
deigned
to
listen
to
so
low
a
creature
she
desires
me
to
assure
you
that
she
hates
you
and
commands
you
never
again
to
attempt
the
insolence
of
appearing
in
her
sight
indeed
this
is
the
language
of
every
soul
in
this
house
lady
d
miss
d
s
miss
b
besides
that
of
d
d
harley
street
thaddeus
read
this
ridiculous
letter
twice
before
he
could
perfectly
comprehend
its
meaning
in
a
paroxysm
of
indignation
at
the
base
subterfuge
under
which
he
did
not
doubt
euphemia
had
screened
some
accidental
discovery
of
her
absurd
passion
he
hastily
threw
on
his
clothes
and
determined
though
in
defiance
of
miss
mandates
to
fly
to
harley
street
and
clear
himself
in
the
eyes
of
miss
beaufort
and
her
venerable
aunt
having
flown
rather
than
walked
he
arrived
in
sight
of
lady
house
just
as
a
coachful
of
her
ladyship
maids
and
packages
drove
from
the
door
hurrying
up
the
step
he
asked
the
porter
if
miss
dorothy
somerset
were
at
home
no
replied
the
man
she
and
miss
beaufort
with
miss
dundas
and
somerset
went
out
of
town
this
morning
by
eight
and
my
lady
and
miss
euphemia
about
an
hour
ago
set
off
for
scotland
where
they
mean
to
stay
all
the
summer
at
this
information
which
seemed
to
be
the
sealing
of
his
condemnation
with
mary
the
heart
of
thaddeus
was
pierced
to
the
core
unacquainted
until
this
moment
with
the
torments
attending
the
knowledge
of
being
calumniated
he
could
scarcely
subdue
the
tempest
in
his
breast
when
forced
to
receive
the
conviction
that
the
woman
he
loved
above
all
the
world
now
regarded
him
as
not
merely
a
villain
but
the
meanest
of
villains
he
returned
home
indignant
and
agitated
the
probability
that
pembroke
somerset
had
listened
to
the
falsehood
of
euphemia
without
suggesting
one
word
in
defence
of
him
who
once
was
his
friend
inflicted
a
pang
more
deadly
than
the
rest
shutting
himself
within
his
apartment
tossed
and
tortured
in
soul
he
traversed
the
room
first
one
idea
occurred
and
then
another
until
he
resolved
to
seek
redress
from
the
advice
of
lady
tinemouth
with
this
determination
he
descended
the
stairs
and
telling
robson
he
should
leave
london
the
ensuing
day
for
lincolnshire
begged
her
not
to
be
uneasy
on
his
account
as
he
went
on
business
and
would
return
in
a
few
days
the
good
woman
almost
wept
at
this
intelligence
and
prayed
heaven
to
guard
him
wherever
he
went
next
morning
having
risen
at
an
early
hour
he
was
collecting
his
few
articles
of
wardrobe
to
put
into
his
for
his
meditated
short
visit
when
going
to
open
one
of
the
top
drawers
in
his
chamber
he
found
it
sealed
and
observed
on
the
black
wax
the
impress
of
an
eagle
it
was
a
large
seal
hardly
crediting
his
eyes
it
appeared
to
be
the
armorial
eagle
of
poland
surmounted
by
its
regal
crown
nay
it
seemed
an
impression
of
the
very
seal
which
had
belonged
to
his
royal
ancestor
john
sobieski
and
which
was
appended
to
the
watch
of
his
grandfather
when
he
was
robbed
of
it
on
his
first
arrival
in
england
thaddeus
in
a
wondering
surprise
immediately
rang
the
bell
and
robson
herself
came
up
stairs
he
hurriedly
but
gently
inquired
how
the
drawer
became
not
only
locked
as
he
had
left
it
but
fastened
with
such
a
seal
robson
did
not
perceive
his
agitation
and
simply
replied
while
his
honor
was
in
that
horrid
place
and
after
the
attempt
of
jackson
to
get
possession
of
his
property
she
had
considered
it
right
to
so
secure
the
drawer
which
she
believed
contained
his
most
valuable
pictures
and
the
like
so
having
no
impression
of
her
own
big
enough
she
went
and
bought
a
bunch
of
tarnished
she
had
seen
hanging
in
the
window
of
a
huckster
shop
at
the
corner
of
an
ally
hard
by
one
of
them
appearing
about
the
size
she
wanted
the
woman
of
the
shop
told
her
she
had
found
them
at
the
bottom
of
a
tub
of
old
iron
sold
to
her
a
while
ago
by
a
dustman
and
as
to
be
sure
they
were
damaged
and
very
dirty
she
would
not
ask
more
than
a
couple
of
shillings
for
the
lot
and
would
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
them
so
sir
continued
robson
with
a
pleased
look
i
gave
the
money
and
hastened
home
as
fast
as
i
could
and
with
watts
by
my
side
to
witness
it
you
see
i
made
all
safe
which
i
thought
you
most
cared
for
you
are
very
thoughtful
for
me
kindest
of
women
returned
thaddeus
with
grateful
energy
but
let
me
see
the
seals
for
it
is
possible
i
may
recognize
in
the
one
of
this
impression
indeed
a
relic
precious
to
my
memory
robson
put
her
hand
into
her
pocket
and
instantly
gave
them
to
him
there
were
three
one
large
two
small
and
strung
together
by
a
leather
thong
the
former
massive
gold
chain
was
no
longer
their
link
and
the
rust
from
the
iron
had
clouded
the
setting
but
a
glance
told
sobieski
they
were
his
he
pressed
them
to
his
heart
whilst
with
glistening
eyes
he
turned
away
to
conceal
his
emotion
his
sensible
landlady
comprehended
there
was
something
more
than
she
knew
of
in
the
recognition
he
never
having
told
her
of
the
loss
of
his
watch
when
he
had
saved
her
little
grandchild
from
the
plunging
horses
in
the
king
mews
and
from
her
native
delicacy
not
to
intrude
on
his
feelings
she
gently
withdrew
unobserved
and
left
him
alone
about
half
an
hour
afterwards
when
she
saw
her
beloved
lodger
depart
in
the
that
called
to
take
him
up
her
eyes
followed
the
wheels
down
the
lane
with
renewed
blessings
his
long
journey
passed
not
more
in
melancholy
reveries
against
the
disappointing
characters
he
had
met
in
revered
england
than
in
affectionate
anticipations
of
the
moment
in
which
he
should
pour
out
his
gratitude
to
the
maternal
tenderness
of
lady
tinemouth
and
learn
from
her
ingenuous
lips
how
to
efface
from
the
minds
of
miss
dorothy
somerset
and
her
niece
the
representations
so
dishonoring
torturing
and
false
which
had
been
heaped
upon
him
by
the
calumnies
of
the
family
in
harley
street
chapter
xxxviii
zeal
is
power
the
porter
at
lady
dundas
had
been
strictly
correct
in
his
account
respecting
the
destination
of
the
dispersed
members
of
her
household
whilst
pembroke
somerset
was
sullenly
executing
his
forced
act
of
benevolence
at
newgate
miss
dundas
suddenly
took
into
her
scheming
head
to
compare
the
merits
of
somerset
rich
expectancy
with
the
penniless
certainty
of
lascelles
she
considered
the
substantial
advantages
which
the
wife
of
a
wealthy
baronet
would
hold
over
the
thriftless
of
a
man
owning
no
other
estate
than
a
reflected
lustre
from
the
coronet
of
an
elder
brother
besides
pembroke
was
very
handsome
lascelles
only
tolerably
so
indeed
some
women
had
presumed
to
call
him
very
plain
but
they
were
stupid
persons
who
not
believing
the
doctrine
of
the
tailor
and
his
decorating
adjuncts
could
not
comprehend
that
although
a
mere
human
creature
can
have
no
such
property
a
man
of
fashion
may
possess
an
which
makes
age
youth
deformity
beauty
and
even
transforms
vice
into
virtue
in
spite
of
recollection
which
reminded
diana
how
often
she
had
contended
that
all
lascelles
teeth
were
his
own
that
his
nose
was
not
a
bit
too
long
being
a
facsimile
of
the
feature
which
reared
its
sublime
curve
over
the
capricious
mouth
of
his
noble
brother
the
earl
of
castle
conway
notwithstanding
all
this
the
pythagorean
pretensions
of
fashion
began
to
lose
their
ascendency
and
in
the
recesses
of
her
mind
when
miss
dundas
compared
the
light
elegance
of
pembroke
figure
with
the
heavy
limbs
of
her
present
lover
pembroke
dark
and
eyes
with
the
gooseberry
orbs
of
lascelles
she
dropped
the
parallel
and
resolving
to
captivate
the
heir
of
somerset
castle
admitted
no
remorse
at
jilting
the
brother
of
castle
conway
to
this
end
before
pembroke
return
from
newgate
diana
had
told
her
mother
of
her
intention
to
accompany
miss
dorothy
to
the
baronet
where
she
would
remain
until
her
ladyship
should
think
euphemia
might
be
trusted
to
rejoin
her
in
town
neither
miss
dorothy
nor
miss
beaufort
liked
this
arrangement
and
next
morning
with
an
aching
heart
the
latter
prepared
to
take
her
seat
in
the
travelling
equipage
which
was
to
convey
them
all
into
leicestershire
after
supper
pembroke
coldly
informed
his
cousin
of
the
success
of
her
commands
that
constantine
was
at
liberty
this
assurance
though
imparted
with
so
ungracious
an
air
laid
her
head
with
less
distraction
on
her
pillow
and
as
she
stepped
into
sir
carriage
next
day
enabled
her
with
more
ease
to
deck
her
lips
with
smiles
she
felt
that
the
penetrating
eyes
of
somerset
were
never
withdrawn
from
her
face
offended
with
his
perverseness
and
their
scrutiny
she
tried
to
baffle
their
inspection
she
attempted
gayety
when
she
gladly
would
have
wept
but
when
the
coach
mounted
the
top
of
highgate
hill
and
she
had
a
last
view
of
that
city
which
contained
the
being
whose
happiness
was
the
sole
object
of
her
thoughts
and
prayers
she
leaned
out
of
the
window
to
hide
a
tear
she
could
not
repress
feeling
that
another
and
another
would
start
she
complained
of
the
dust
and
pulling
her
veil
over
her
eyes
drew
back
into
the
corner
of
the
carriage
the
trembling
of
her
voice
and
hands
during
the
performance
of
this
little
artifice
too
well
explained
to
pembroke
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
at
once
dispelling
the
gloom
which
shrouded
his
own
countenance
he
turned
towards
her
with
compassionate
tenderness
in
his
words
and
looks
he
called
her
attention
by
degrees
to
the
happy
domestic
scene
she
was
to
meet
at
the
castle
and
thus
gradually
softening
her
displeasure
into
the
easy
conversation
of
reciprocal
affection
he
rendered
the
remainder
of
their
long
journey
less
irksome
when
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
miss
beaufort
found
herself
in
the
old
avenue
leading
to
the
base
of
the
hill
which
sustains
the
revered
walls
of
somerset
castellated
towers
a
mingled
emotion
took
possession
of
her
breast
and
when
the
carriage
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
highest
terrace
she
sprang
impatiently
out
of
it
and
hastening
up
the
stone
stairs
into
the
front
hall
met
her
uncle
at
the
door
of
the
where
he
held
out
his
arms
to
receive
her
my
mary
my
darling
cried
he
embracing
her
now
wet
cheek
and
straining
her
throbbing
bosom
to
his
own
why
my
dear
love
added
he
almost
carrying
her
into
the
room
i
am
afraid
this
visit
to
town
has
injured
your
nerves
whence
arises
this
agitation
she
knew
it
had
injured
her
peace
and
now
that
the
floodgates
of
her
tears
were
opened
it
was
beyond
her
power
or
the
soothings
of
her
affectionate
uncle
to
stay
them
a
moment
afterwards
her
cousin
entered
the
room
followed
by
miss
dorothy
and
miss
dundas
miss
beaufort
hastily
rose
to
conceal
what
she
could
not
check
kissing
sir
robert
hand
she
asked
permission
to
retire
under
the
pretence
of
regaining
those
spirits
which
had
been
dissipated
by
the
fatigues
of
her
journey
in
her
own
chamber
she
did
indeed
struggle
to
recover
herself
she
shuddered
at
the
impetuosity
of
her
emotions
when
once
abandoned
of
their
reins
and
resolved
from
this
hour
to
hold
a
stricter
control
over
such
betrayals
of
her
devoted
heart
she
sat
in
the
window
of
her
apartment
and
looking
down
the
extensive
vale
of
somerset
watched
the
romantic
meanderings
of
its
shadowed
river
winding
its
course
through
the
domains
of
the
castle
and
nourishing
the
roots
of
those
immense
oaks
which
for
many
a
century
had
waved
their
branches
over
its
stream
she
reflected
on
the
revolution
which
had
take
place
in
herself
since
she
walked
on
its
banks
the
evening
that
preceded
her
visit
to
london
then
she
was
free
as
the
air
gay
as
the
lark
each
object
was
bright
and
lovely
in
her
eyes
hope
seemed
to
woo
her
from
every
green
slope
every
remote
dingle
all
nature
breathed
of
joy
because
her
own
breast
was
the
abode
of
gladness
now
all
continued
the
same
but
she
was
changed
surrounded
by
beauty
she
acknowledged
its
presence
the
sweetness
of
the
flowers
bathed
her
senses
in
fragrance
the
setting
sun
gilding
the
height
shed
a
yellow
glory
over
the
distant
hills
the
birds
were
hailing
the
falling
dew
which
spangled
every
leaf
she
gazed
around
and
sighed
heavily
when
she
said
to
herself
even
in
this
paradise
i
shall
be
wretched
alas
my
heart
is
far
away
my
soul
lingers
about
one
i
may
never
more
behold
about
one
who
may
soon
cease
to
remember
that
such
a
being
as
mary
beaufort
is
in
existence
he
will
leave
england
cried
she
raising
her
hands
and
eyes
to
the
glowing
heavens
he
will
live
he
will
die
far
far
from
me
in
a
distant
land
he
will
wed
another
whilst
i
shall
know
no
wish
that
strays
from
him
whilst
she
indulged
in
these
soliloquies
she
forgot
both
sir
robert
and
her
resolution
until
he
sent
her
maid
to
beg
if
she
were
better
that
she
would
come
down
and
make
tea
for
him
at
this
summons
she
dried
her
eyes
and
with
assumed
serenity
descended
to
the
saloon
where
the
family
were
assembled
the
baronet
having
greeted
miss
dundas
with
an
hospitable
welcome
seated
himself
between
his
sister
and
his
son
and
whilst
he
received
his
favorite
beverage
from
the
hands
of
his
beloved
niece
he
found
that
comfort
once
more
his
bosom
sir
robert
somerset
was
a
man
whose
appearance
alone
attracted
respect
his
person
bore
the
stamp
of
dignity
and
his
manners
which
possessed
the
exquisite
polish
of
travel
and
of
society
in
its
most
refined
courts
secured
him
universal
esteem
though
little
beyond
fifty
various
perplexing
situations
having
distressed
his
youth
had
not
only
rendered
his
hair
prematurely
gray
but
by
clouding
his
once
brilliant
eyes
with
thoughtfulness
marked
his
aspect
with
premature
old
age
and
melancholy
the
baronet
entrance
into
town
life
had
been
celebrated
for
his
graceful
vivacity
he
was
the
animating
spirit
of
every
party
till
an
inexplicable
metamorphosis
suddenly
took
place
soon
after
his
return
from
abroad
he
had
married
miss
beaufort
a
woman
whom
he
loved
to
adoration
when
strange
to
say
excess
of
happiness
seemed
to
change
his
nature
and
give
his
character
a
deep
tinge
of
sadness
after
his
wife
death
the
alteration
in
his
mind
produced
still
more
extraordinary
effects
and
showed
itself
more
than
once
in
all
the
terrors
of
threatened
mental
derangement
his
latest
attack
of
the
kind
assailed
him
during
the
last
winter
under
the
appearance
of
a
swoon
while
he
sat
at
breakfast
reading
the
newspaper
he
was
carried
to
bed
and
awoke
in
a
delirium
which
menaced
either
immediate
death
or
the
total
extinction
of
his
intellects
however
neither
of
these
dreads
being
confirmed
in
the
course
of
several
weeks
to
the
wonder
of
everybody
he
recovered
much
of
his
health
and
his
sound
mind
notwithstanding
this
happy
event
the
circumstances
of
his
danger
so
deeply
affected
his
family
that
he
ceased
not
to
be
an
object
of
the
most
anxious
attention
indeed
solicitude
did
not
terminate
with
them
the
munificence
of
his
disposition
having
spread
itself
through
every
county
in
which
he
owned
a
rood
of
land
as
many
prayers
ascended
for
the
repose
of
his
spirit
as
ever
petitioned
heaven
from
the
mouths
of
monkish
beadsmen
in
favor
of
power
and
virtue
since
the
demise
of
lady
somerset
this
man
drew
all
his
earthly
comfort
from
the
amiable
qualities
of
his
son
pembroke
sometimes
in
his
livelier
hours
which
came
like
angel
visits
few
and
far
between
he
amused
himself
with
the
playfulness
of
the
little
earl
of
avon
the
pompous
erudition
of
loftus
who
was
become
his
young
ward
tutor
and
with
giving
occasional
entertainments
to
the
gentry
in
his
neighborhood
of
all
the
personages
contained
within
this
circle
which
the
hospitality
of
sir
robert
extended
to
a
circumference
of
fifty
miles
the
noble
family
of
castle
granby
brave
patriotic
and
accomplished
with
female
beauty
at
its
head
fitted
to
move
in
courts
or
walk
the
shade
with
innocence
and
contemplation
joined
were
held
in
the
highest
and
most
intimate
appreciation
while
many
of
the
numerous
titled
visitants
who
attended
the
celebrated
and
magnificent
granby
hunt
were
of
too
convivial
notoriety
to
be
often
admitted
within
the
social
of
either
castle
granby
or
somerset
castle
the
two
cynosure
mansions
which
now
crest
with
their
peaceful
groves
the
summits
of
those
two
promontory
heights
whereon
in
former
times
they
stood
in
fortress
strength
the
guardians
of
each
opening
pass
into
that
spacious
and
once
important
belligerent
vale
amongst
the
frequenters
of
the
chase
was
devoted
nimrod
sir
richard
shafto
who
every
season
fixed
himself
and
family
at
a
convenient
near
the
little
town
of
grantham
with
his
right
worthy
son
and
heir
who
by
calling
at
somerset
castle
soon
after
the
arrival
of
his
guests
caused
a
trifling
change
in
its
arrangements
when
dick
shafto
as
all
the
grooms
in
the
stables
familiarly
designated
him
was
ushered
into
the
room
he
nodded
to
sir
robert
and
turning
his
back
on
the
ladies
told
pembroke
he
had
ridden
to
somerset
on
purpose
to
him
for
woodhill
lodge
upon
my
life
cried
he
if
you
do
come
i
will
cut
and
run
there
is
not
a
creature
but
yourself
within
twenty
miles
to
whom
i
can
speak
not
a
man
worth
a
sixpence
i
wish
my
father
had
broken
his
neck
before
he
accepted
that
confounded
embassy
which
encumbers
me
with
the
charge
of
my
old
mother
after
this
dutiful
wish
which
brought
down
a
weighty
admonition
from
miss
dorothy
the
young
gentleman
promised
to
behave
better
provided
she
would
persuade
pembroke
to
accompany
him
to
the
lodge
somerset
did
not
show
much
alacrity
in
his
consent
but
to
rid
his
family
of
so
noisy
a
guest
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
acquiescing
in
the
sacrifice
of
a
few
clays
to
good
nature
bade
his
father
farewell
and
gave
orders
for
a
ride
to
grantham
as
soon
as
the
gentlemen
left
the
saloon
miss
dundas
ran
up
stairs
and
from
her
window
in
the
west
tower
pursued
the
steps
of
their
horses
as
they
cantered
down
the
winding
steep
into
the
high
road
an
abrupt
angle
of
the
hill
hiding
them
from
her
view
she
turned
round
with
a
toss
of
the
head
and
flinging
herself
into
a
chair
exclaimed
now
i
shall
be
bored
to
death
by
this
prosing
family
i
wish
his
boasted
hunter
had
run
away
with
shafto
before
he
thought
of
coming
here
in
consequence
of
the
temper
which
engendered
the
above
no
very
flattering
compliment
to
the
society
at
the
castle
miss
dundas
descended
to
the
with
sulky
looks
and
a
chilling
air
she
ate
what
the
baronet
laid
on
her
plate
with
an
indolent
appetite
cut
her
meat
carelessly
and
dragged
the
vegetables
over
the
miss
dorothy
colored
at
this
indifference
to
the
usual
neatness
of
her
damask
covers
but
miss
dundas
was
so
completely
in
the
sullens
that
heedless
of
any
other
feelings
than
her
own
she
continued
to
pull
and
knock
about
the
things
just
as
her
dictated
the
petulance
of
this
lady
behavior
did
not
in
the
least
assimilate
with
the
customary
decorum
of
sir
robert
table
and
when
the
cloth
was
drawn
he
could
not
refrain
from
expressing
his
concern
that
somerset
castle
appeared
so
little
calculated
to
afford
satisfaction
to
a
daughter
of
lady
dundas
miss
dundas
attempted
some
awkward
declaration
that
she
never
was
more
amused
never
happier
but
the
small
credit
sir
robert
gave
to
her
assertion
was
fully
warranted
the
next
morning
by
the
ready
manner
in
which
she
accepting
a
casual
invitation
to
spend
the
ensuing
day
and
night
at
lady
shafto
her
ladyship
called
on
miss
dorothy
and
intended
to
have
a
party
in
the
evening
invited
the
two
young
ladies
to
return
with
her
to
woodhill
lodge
and
be
her
guests
for
a
week
miss
beaufort
whose
spirits
were
far
from
tranquillized
declined
her
civility
but
with
a
gleam
of
pleasure
she
heard
it
accepted
by
miss
dundas
who
departed
with
her
ladyship
for
the
lodge
whilst
the
enraptured
diana
all
life
and
glee
bowled
along
with
lady
shafto
anticipating
the
delight
of
once
more
seating
herself
at
the
elbow
of
pembroke
somerset
mary
beaufort
relieved
from
a
load
of
attentions
walked
out
into
the
park
to
enjoy
in
solitude
the
sweet
sorrow
of
thinking
on
the
unhappy
and
distant
constantine
regardless
of
the
way
her
footsteps
though
robbed
of
elasticity
by
nightly
watching
and
daily
regret
led
her
beyond
the
park
to
the
ruined
church
of
woolthorpe
its
southern
boundary
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
opposite
horizon
it
was
the
extremity
of
leicestershire
and
far
far
behind
those
hills
was
that
london
which
contained
the
object
dearest
to
her
soul
the
wind
seemed
scarcely
to
breathe
as
it
floated
towards
her
but
it
came
from
that
quarter
and
believing
it
laden
with
every
sweet
which
love
can
fancy
she
threw
back
her
veil
to
inhale
its
balm
then
blaming
herself
for
such
weakness
she
turned
blushing
homewards
and
wept
at
what
she
thought
her
unreasonably
tenacious
passion
the
arrival
of
miss
dundas
at
the
lodge
was
communicated
to
the
two
young
men
on
their
return
from
traversing
half
the
country
in
quest
of
game
the
news
drew
an
oath
from
shafto
but
rather
pleased
somerset
who
augured
some
amusement
from
her
attempts
at
wit
and
judgment
tired
to
death
and
dinner
being
over
when
they
entered
with
ravenous
appetites
they
devoured
their
uncomfortable
meal
in
a
remote
room
then
throwing
themselves
along
the
sofas
yawned
and
slept
for
nearly
two
hours
pembroke
waking
first
suddenly
jumped
on
the
floor
and
shaking
his
disordered
clothes
exclaimed
shafto
get
up
this
is
abominable
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
if
we
spend
one
half
of
our
days
in
pleasure
and
the
other
in
lolling
off
its
fatigues
we
shall
have
passed
through
life
more
to
our
shame
than
our
profit
then
you
take
the
shame
and
leave
me
the
profit
cried
his
companion
turning
himself
round
so
to
you
pembroke
rang
the
bell
a
servant
entered
what
is
it
nine
sir
who
are
above
my
lady
sir
and
a
large
party
of
ladies
there
now
cried
shafto
yawning
and
kicking
out
his
legs
you
surely
wo
go
to
be
bored
with
such
maudlin
company
i
choose
to
join
your
mother
replied
pembroke
are
there
any
gentlemen
stephen
one
sir
doctor
denton

with
you
roared
shafto
what
do
you
stand
jabbering
there
for
you
wo
let
me
sleep
ca
you
send
away
the
fellow
and
go
look
yourself
i
will
if
you
can
persuade
yourself
to
rise
off
that
sofa
and
come
with
me
may
lady
hecate
catch
me
if
i
do
get
about
your
business
and
leave
me
to
mine
you
are
incorrigible
shafto
returned
pembroke
as
he
closed
the
door
he
went
up
stairs
to
change
his
dress
and
before
he
gained
the
second
flight
he
resolved
not
to
spend
another
whole
day
in
the
company
of
such
an
ignorant
unmannerly
cub
on
somerset
entrance
into
lady
shafto
he
saw
many
ladies
but
only
one
gentleman
who
was
the
denton
a
poor
parasitical
animal
pembroke
having
seen
enough
of
him
to
despise
his
pretensions
both
to
science
and
sincerity
returned
his
wide
smirk
and
eager
inquiries
with
a
ceremonious
bow
and
took
his
seat
by
the
side
of
the
now
delighted
miss
dundas
the
vivid
spirits
of
diana
which
she
now
strove
to
render
peculiarly
sparkling
entertained
him
when
compared
with
the
insipid
sameness
of
her
ladyship
or
the
coarse
ribaldry
of
her
son
the
mirth
of
miss
dundas
was
wit
and
her
remarks
wisdom
dear
mr
somerset
cried
she
how
good
you
are
to
break
this
sad
solemnity
i
vow
until
you
showed
your
face
i
thought
the
days
of
paganism
were
revived
and
that
lacking
men
we
were
assembled
here
to
celebrate
the
mysteries
of
the
lacking
men
replied
he
smiling
you
have
the
assiduous
doctor
denton
o
no
that
is
a
chameleon
in
man
clothing
he
breathes
air
he
eats
air
he
speaks
air
and
a
most
pestilential
breath
it
is
only
observe
how
he
is
pouring
its
fumes
into
the
ear
of
yonder
sable
statue
pembroke
directed
his
eyes
as
miss
dundas
desired
him
and
saw
denton
whispering
and
bowing
before
a
lady
in
black
the
lady
put
up
her
lip
the
doctor
proceeded
she
frowned
he
would
not
be
daunted
the
lady
rose
from
her
seat
and
slightly
bending
her
head
crossed
the
room
whilst
somerset
was
contemplating
her
graceful
figure
and
fine
though
pale
features
miss
dundas
touched
his
arm
and
smiling
satirically
repeated
in
an
affected
voice
hail
pensive
nun
devout
and
holy
hail
divinest
melancholy
if
she
be
melancholy
returned
pembroke
i
would
forever
say
hence
unholy
mirth
of
folly
born
miss
dundas
reddened
she
never
liked
this
interesting
woman
who
was
not
only
too
handsome
for
competition
but
possessed
an
understanding
that
would
not
tolerate
ignorance
or
presumption

impertinence
having
several
times
received
deserved
chastisement
from
that
quarter
she
was
vexed
to
the
soul
when
pembroke
closed
his
animated
response
with
the
question
who
is
she
rather
too
bitterly
for
the
design
on
his
heart
miss
dundas
iterated
his
words
and
then
answered
why
she
is
crazed
she
lives
in
a
place
called
harrowby
abbey
at
the
top
of
that
hill
continued
she
pointing
through
the
opposite
window
to
a
distant
rising
ground
on
which
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
and
i
am
told
she
frightens
the
cottagers
out
of
their
wits
by
her
midnight
strolls
hardly
knowing
how
to
credit
this
wild
account
pembroke
asked
his
informer
if
she
were
serious
never
more
so
her
eyes
are
uncommonly
wild
you
must
be
jesting
returned
he
they
seem
perfectly
reasonable
miss
dundas
laughed
like
hamlet
they
not
seems
but
have
that
within
which
passeth
show
believe
me
she
is
mad
enough
for
bedlam
and
of
that
i
could
soon
convince
you
i
wonder
how
lady
shafto
thought
of
inviting
her
she
quite
stupefied
our
dinner
well
cried
pembroke
if
those
features
announce
madness
i
shall
never
admire
a
look
of
sense
again
bless
us
exclaimed
miss
dundas
you
are
wonderfully
struck
you
see
she
is
old
enough
to
be
your
mother
that
maybe
answered
he
smiling
nevertheless
she
is
one
of
the
most
lovely
women
i
ever
beheld
come
tell
me
her
name
i
will
satisfy
you
in
a
moment
rejoined
diana
and
then
away
with
your
rhapsodies
she
is
the
very
countess
of
tinemouth
who
brought
that
vagabond
foreigner
to
our
house
who
would
have
run
off
with
phemy
lady
tinemouth
exclaimed
pembroke
i
never
saw
her
before
my
mother
knew
her
whilst
i
was
abroad
and
she
esteemed
her
highly
pray
introduce
me
to
her
impossible
replied
diana
vexed
at
the
turn
his
curiosity
had
taken
i
wrote
to
her
about
the
insidious
wretch
and
now
we
speak
then
i
will
introduce
myself
answered
he
he
was
moving
away
when
miss
dundas
caught
his
arm
and
by
various
attempts
at
badinage
and
raillery
held
him
in
his
place
until
the
countess
had
made
her
farewell
curtsey
to
lady
shafto
and
the
door
was
closed
disappointed
by
this
manoeuvre
pembroke
himself
and
wondering
why
his
aunt
and
cousin
had
not
heard
of
lady
arrival
at
harrowby
he
determined
to
wait
on
her
next
day
regardless
of
every
word
which
the
provoked
diana
addressed
to
him
he
remained
silent
and
meditating
until
the
loud
voice
of
shafto
bellowing
in
his
ear
made
him
turn
suddenly
round
miss
dundas
tried
to
laugh
at
his
reverie
though
she
knew
that
such
a
flagrant
instance
of
inattention
was
death
to
her
hopes
but
pembroke
not
inclined
to
partake
in
the
jest
coolly
asked
his
bearish
companion
what
he
wanted
nothing
cried
he
but
to
hear
you
speak
miss
dundas
tells
me
you
have
lost
your
heart
to
yonder
grim
countess
my
mother
wanted
me
to
gallant
her
up
the
hill
but
i
would
see
her
in
the
river
first
shafto
answered
pembroke
rising
from
his
chair
you
can
not
be
speaking
of
lady
tinemouth
efaith
i
am
roared
he
and
if
she
be
such
a
scamp
as
to
live
without
a
carriage
i
wo
be
her
lackey
for
nothing
the
matter
of
a
mile
is
not
to
be
tramped
over
by
me
with
no
pleasanter
companion
than
an
old
painted
woman
of
quality
surely
you
can
not
mean
returned
pembroke
that
her
ladyship
was
to
walk
from
this
place
without
a
doubt
cried
shafto
bursting
into
a
hoarse
laugh
you
would
be
clever
to
see
my
lady
stingy
in
any
other
carriage
than
her
clogs
irritated
at
the
malice
of
miss
dundas
and
despising
the
vulgar
illiberality
of
shafto
without
deigning
a
reply
pembroke
abruptly
left
the
room
and
hastening
out
of
the
house
ran
rather
than
walked
in
hopes
of
overtaking
the
countess
before
she
reached
harrowby
chapter
xxxix
the
vale
of
belvoir
pembroke
crossed
the
little
wooden
bridge
which
lies
over
the
witham
he
scoured
the
field
he
leaped
every
stile
and
gate
in
his
way
and
at
last
gained
the
enclosure
that
leads
to
the
top
of
the
hill
where
he
descried
a
light
moving
and
very
rightly
conjectured
it
must
be
the
lantern
carried
by
the
countess
attendant
another
spring
over
the
shattered
fence
cleared
all
obstacles
and
he
found
himself
close
to
lady
tinemouth
who
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
gentleman
pembroke
stopped
at
this
sight
supposing
she
had
been
met
by
some
person
belonging
to
the
neighborhood
whose
readier
gallantry
now
occupied
the
place
which
miss
dundas
had
prevented
him
from
filling
he
was
preparing
to
retreat
when
lady
tinemouth
happening
to
turn
her
head
imagined
from
the
hesitating
embarrassment
of
his
manner
that
he
was
a
stranger
who
had
lost
his
way
and
accosted
him
with
that
inquiry
pembroke
bowed
in
some
confusion
and
related
the
simple
fact
of
his
having
heard
that
she
had
quitted
lady
shafto
house
without
any
guard
but
the
servant
and
that
the
moment
he
learned
the
circumstance
he
had
hurried
out
to
proffer
his
services
the
countess
not
only
thanked
him
for
such
attention
but
constrained
by
a
civility
which
at
that
instant
she
could
have
wished
not
to
have
been
necessary
asked
him
to
walk
forward
with
her
to
the
abbey
and
partake
of
some
refreshment
but
added
she
though
i
perfectly
recollect
having
seen
another
gentleman
in
lady
shafto
room
besides
doctor
denton
i
have
not
the
honor
of
knowing
your
name
it
is
somerset
returned
pembroke
i
am
the
son
of
that
lady
somerset
who
during
the
last
year
of
her
life
had
the
happiness
of
being
intimate
with
your
ladyship
lady
tinemouth
expressed
her
pleasure
at
this
meeting
and
turning
to
the
gentleman
who
was
walking
in
silence
by
her
side
said
constantine
allow
me
to
introduce
to
you
the
cousin
of
the
amiable
miss
beaufort
thaddeus
who
had
too
well
recognized
the
voice
of
his
false
friend
in
the
first
accents
he
addressed
to
the
countess
with
a
swelling
heart
bent
his
head
to
the
cold
salutation
of
somerset
hearing
that
her
ladyship
companion
was
the
same
constantine
whom
he
had
liberated
from
prison
pembroke
was
stimulated
with
a
desire
to
take
the
perhaps
favorable
occasion
to
unmask
his
double
villany
to
lady
tinemouth
and
conceiving
a
curiosity
to
see
the
man
whose
person
and
meretricious
qualities
had
blinded
the
judgment
of
his
aunt
and
cousin
he
readily
obeyed
the
second
invitation
of
the
countess
and
consented
to
go
home
and
sup
with
her
meanwhile
thaddeus
was
agitated
with
a
variety
of
emotions
every
tone
of
pembroke
voice
reminding
him
of
happier
days
pierced
his
heart
whilst
a
sense
of
his
ingratitude
awakened
all
the
pride
and
indignation
of
his
soul
full
of
resentment
he
determined
that
whatever
might
be
the
result
he
would
not
shrink
from
an
interview
the
anticipation
of
which
pembroke
who
had
received
from
himself
an
intimation
of
the
name
he
had
assumed
seemed
to
regard
with
so
much
contemptuous
indifference
not
imagining
that
somerset
and
the
count
had
any
personal
knowledge
of
each
other
lady
tinemouth
begged
the
gentlemen
to
accompany
her
into
the
pembroke
with
inconsiderate
real
indifference
passed
by
thaddeus
to
give
his
hand
to
the
countess
thaddeus
was
so
shocked
at
this
instance
of
something
very
like
a
personal
affront
that
insulted
in
every
nerve
he
was
obliged
to
pause
a
moment
in
the
hall
to
summon
coolness
to
follow
him
with
a
composed
step
and
dispassionate
countenance
he
accomplished
this
conquest
over
himself
and
taking
off
his
hat
entered
the
room
lady
tinemouth
began
to
congratulate
herself
with
many
kind
expressions
on
his
arrival
the
eyes
of
pembroke
fixed
themselves
on
the
calm
but
severe
aspect
of
the
man
before
him
he
stood
by
the
table
with
such
an
air
of
noble
greatness
that
the
candid
heart
of
pembroke
somerset
soon
whispered
to
himself
sure
nothing
ill
can
dwell
in
such
a
breast
still
his
eyes
followed
him
when
he
turned
round
and
when
he
bent
his
head
to
answer
the
countess
but
in
a
voice
so
low
that
it
escaped
his
ear
pembroke
was
bewildered
there
was
something
in
the
features
in
the
mien
of
this
foreigner
so
like
his
friend
sobieski
but
then
sobieski
was
all
frankness
and
animation
his
cheek
bloomed
with
the
rich
coloring
of
youth
and
happiness
his
eyes
flashed
pleasure
and
his
lips
were
decked
with
smiles
on
the
contrary
the
person
before
him
was
not
only
considerably
taller
and
of
more
manly
proportions
but
his
face
was
pale
reserved
and
haughty
besides
he
did
not
appear
even
to
recollect
the
name
of
somerset
and
what
at
once
might
destroy
the
supposition
his
own
was
simply
constantine
these
reasonings
having
quickly
passed
through
the
mind
of
pembroke
they
left
his
heart
unsatisfied
the
conflict
of
his
doubts
flushed
his
cheeks
his
bosom
beat
and
keeping
his
searching
and
ardent
gaze
riveted
on
the
man
who
was
either
his
friend
or
his
counterpart
on
lady
tinemouth
turning
away
to
lay
her
cloak
down
the
eyes
of
the
young
men
met
thaddeus
turned
paler
than
before
there
is
an
intelligence
in
the
interchange
of
looks
which
can
not
be
mistaken
it
is
the
communication
of
souls
and
there
is
no
deception
in
their
language
pembroke
flew
forward
and
catching
hold
of
his
hand
exclaimed
in
an
impetuous
voice
am
i
right
are
you
sobieski
i
am
returned
thaddeus
almost
inarticulate
with
emotion
and
hardly
knowing
what
to
understand
by
somerset
behavior
gracious
heaven
cried
he
still
grasping
his
hand
can
you
have
forgotten
your
friend
pembroke
somerset
the
ingenuous
heart
of
thaddeus
acknowledged
the
words
and
manner
of
pembroke
to
be
the
language
of
truth
trusting
that
some
mistake
had
involved
his
former
conduct
he
at
once
cast
off
suspicion
and
throwing
his
arms
around
him
strained
him
to
his
breast
and
burst
into
tears
lady
tinemouth
who
during
this
scene
stood
mute
with
surprise
now
advanced
to
the
friends
who
were
weeping
on
each
other
necks
and
taking
a
hand
of
each
my
dear
sobieski
cried
she
why
did
you
withhold
the
knowledge
of
this
friendship
from
me
had
you
told
me
that
you
and
somerset
were
acquainted
this
happy
meeting
might
have
been
accomplished
sooner
yes
replied
pembroke
turning
to
the
countess
and
wiping
away
the
tears
which
were
trembling
on
his
cheek
nothing
could
have
given
me
pain
at
this
moment
but
the
conviction
that
he
who
was
the
preserver
of
my
life
and
my
most
generous
protector
should
in
this
country
have
endured
the
most
abject
distress
rather
than
let
me
know
it
was
in
my
power
to
be
grateful
thaddeus
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
for
a
few
moments
concealed
his
face
the
countess
looked
on
him
with
tenderness
and
believing
he
would
sooner
regain
composure
were
he
alone
with
his
friend
she
stole
unobserved
out
of
the
room
pembroke
affectionately
resumed
but
i
hope
dear
sobieski
you
will
never
leave
me
more
i
have
an
excellent
father
who
when
he
is
made
acquainted
with
my
obligations
to
you
and
your
noble
family
will
glory
in
loving
you
as
a
son
having
subdued
the
woman
in
his
heart
thaddeus
raised
his
head
with
an
expression
in
his
eyes
far
different
from
that
which
had
chilled
the
blood
of
pembroke
on
their
first
encounter
circumstances
said
he
dear
somerset
have
made
me
greatly
injure
you
a
strange
neglect
on
your
side
since
we
separated
at
villanow
gave
the
first
blow
to
my
confidence
in
your
friendship
though
i
lost
your
direct
address
i
wrote
to
you
often
and
yet
you
persevered
in
silence
after
having
witnessed
the
destruction
of
all
that
was
dear
to
me
in
poland
and
then
of
poland
itself
when
i
came
to
england
i
wished
to
give
your
faithfulness
another
chance
i
addressed
two
letters
to
you
i
even
delivered
the
last
at
your
door
myself
and
i
saw
you
in
the
window
when
i
sent
it
in
by
all
that
is
sacred
cried
pembroke
vehemently
and
amazed
i
never
saw
any
letter
from
you
i
wrote
you
many
i
never
heard
of
those
you
mention
indeed
i
should
even
now
have
been
ignorant
of
the
palatine
and
your
mother
cruel
fate
had
it
not
been
too
circumstantially
related
in
the
newspapers
i
believe
you
returned
thaddeus
drawing
an
agonizing
sigh
at
the
dreadful
picture
which
the
last
sentence
recalled
i
believe
you
though
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
i
thought
otherwise
for
both
my
last
letters
were
to
me
in
a
blank
cover
directed
as
if
by
your
hand
and
brought
by
a
servant
with
a
message
that
there
was
no
answer
amazing
exclaimed
somerset
there
must
be
some
horrible
treachery
can
it
be
that
some
lurking
foreign
spy
got
amongst
my
servants
at
dantzic
and
has
been
this
traitor
ever
since
oh
thaddeus
cried
he
abruptly
interrupting
himself
and
grasping
his
hand
i
would
have
flown
to
you
had
it
been
to
meet
death
instead
of
the
greatest
joy
heaven
could
bestow
upon
me
but
why
did
you
not
come
in
yourself
then
no
mistake
could
have
happened
oh
why
did
you
not
come
in
because
i
was
uncertain
of
your
sentiments
my
first
letter
remained
unnoticed
and
my
heart
dear
somerset
added
he
pressing
his
hand
would
not
stoop
to
solicitation
solicitation
exclaimed
pembroke
with
warmth
you
have
a
right
to
demand
my
life
but
there
is
some
deep
villany
in
this
affair
nothing
else
could
have
carried
it
through
oh
if
anybody
belonging
to
me
have
dared
to
open
these
letters
oh
sobieski
cried
he
interrupting
himself
how
you
must
have
despised
me
i
was
afflicted
returned
thaddeus
that
the
man
whom
my
family
so
warmly
loved
could
prove
so
unworthy
and
afterwards
whenever
i
met
you
in
the
streets
which
i
think
was
more
than
once
or
twice
i
confess
that
to
pass
you
cut
me
to
the
heart
and
you
have
met
me
exclaimed
pembroke
and
i
not
see
you
i
can
not
comprehend
it
yes
answered
thaddeus
and
the
first
time
was
going
into
the
playhouse
i
believe
i
called
after
you
is
it
not
now
ten
months
since
returned
pembroke
i
remember
very
well
that
some
one
called
out
my
name
in
a
voice
that
seemed
known
to
me
while
i
was
handing
lady
calthorpe
and
her
sister
into
the
porch
i
looked
about
but
not
seeing
any
one
i
knew
i
thought
i
must
have
been
mistaken
but
why
dear
sobieski
why
did
you
not
follow
me
into
the
theatre
thaddeus
shook
his
head
and
smiled
languidly
my
poverty
would
not
permit
replied
he
but
i
waited
in
the
hall
until
everybody
left
the
house
in
hopes
of
intercepting
you
as
you
passed
again
pembroke
sprung
from
his
chair
at
these
words
and
with
vehemence
exclaimed
i
see
it
that
hypocrite
loftus
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
he
followed
me
into
the
theatre
he
must
have
seen
you
and
his
cursed
selfishness
was
alarmed
yes
it
is
no
foreign
traitor
it
must
be
he
he
would
not
allow
me
to
return
that
way
when
i
said
i
would
he
told
me
a
thousand
lies
about
the
carriages
coming
round
and
i
believing
him
went
out
by
another
door
i
will
tax
him
of
it
to
his
face
who
is
mr
loftus
inquired
thaddeus
surprised
at
his
suspicion
i
do
not
know
the
man
what
returned
pembroke
do
you
remember
that
loftus
is
the
name
of
my
scoundrel
tutor
who
persuaded
me
to
volunteer
against
poland
to
screen
his
baseness
i
have
brought
all
this
upon
myself
now
i
recollect
it
replied
thaddeus
but
i
never
saw
him
yet
i
am
not
less
certain
that
i
am
right
replied
somerset
i
will
tell
you
my
reasons
after
i
quitted
villanow
you
may
remember
i
was
to
meet
him
at
dantzic
before
we
left
the
port
he
implored
almost
on
his
knees
that
in
pity
to
his
mother
and
sisters
whom
he
said
he
supported
out
of
his
salary
i
would
refrain
from
incensing
my
parents
against
him
by
relating
any
circumstance
of
our
visit
to
poland
the
man
shed
tears
as
he
spoke
and
like
a
fool
i
consented
to
keep
the
secret
till
the
vicar
of
somerset
a
poor
soul
still
ill
of
dropsy
dies
and
he
be
in
possession
of
the
living
when
we
landed
in
england
i
found
the
cause
of
my
sudden
recall
had
been
the
illness
of
my
dear
mother
but
heaven
denied
me
the
happiness
of
beholding
her
again
she
had
been
buried
two
days
before
i
reached
the
shore
pembroke
paused
a
moment
and
then
resumed
for
near
a
month
after
my
return
i
could
not
quit
my
room
on
my
recovery
i
wrote
both
to
you
and
to
the
palatine
but
i
still
locked
up
your
names
within
my
heart
the
old
rector
being
yet
in
existence
i
repeated
my
letters
at
least
every
six
weeks
during
the
first
year
of
our
separation
though
you
persisted
in
being
silent
hurt
as
i
was
at
this
neglect
i
believed
that
gratitude
demanded
some
sacrifices
from
pride
and
i
continued
to
write
even
till
the
spring
following
meanwhile
the
papers
of
the
day
teemed
with
sobieski
actions
sobieski
fame
and
supposing
that
increasing
glory
had
blotted
me
out
of
your
memory
i
resolved
thenceforth
to
regard
our
friendship
as
a
dream
and
never
to
speak
of
it
more
confounded
at
this
double
misapprehension
thaddeus
with
a
glowing
countenance
expressed
his
regret
for
having
doubted
his
friend
and
repeating
the
assurance
of
having
been
punctual
to
his
promise
of
correspondence
even
when
he
dreamed
him
inconstant
acknowledged
that
nothing
but
a
premeditated
scheme
could
have
effected
so
many
disappointments
ay
returned
pembroke
reddening
with
awakened
anger
i
could
swear
that
loftus
has
all
my
letters
in
his
bureau
at
this
moment
no
house
ever
gave
a
man
a
better
opportunity
to
play
the
rogue
in
than
ours
it
is
a
custom
with
us
to
lay
our
letters
every
morning
on
the
whence
they
are
sent
to
the
office
and
when
the
post
arrives
they
are
spread
out
in
the
same
way
that
their
several
owners
may
take
them
as
they
pass
to
breakfast
from
this
arrangement
i
can
not
doubt
the
means
by
which
loftus
under
the
hope
of
separating
us
forever
has
intercepted
every
letter
to
you
and
every
letter
from
you
i
suppose
the
wretch
feared
i
might
become
impatient
and
break
my
engagement
if
our
correspondence
were
allowed
he
trembled
lest
the
business
should
be
blown
before
the
rector
died
and
he
in
consequence
lose
both
the
expected
living
and
his
present
situation
about
lord
avon
a
villain
for
once
he
has
judged
rightly
i
will
unmask
him
to
my
father
and
show
him
what
it
is
to
purchase
advancement
at
the
expense
of
honor
and
justice
thaddeus
who
could
not
withhold
immediate
credit
to
these
evidences
of
chicanery
tried
to
calm
the
violence
of
his
friend
who
only
answered
by
insisting
on
having
his
company
back
with
him
to
somerset
castle
i
long
to
present
you
to
my
father
cried
he
when
i
tell
him
who
you
are
of
your
kindness
to
me
how
rejoiced
will
he
be
how
happy
how
proud
to
have
you
his
guest
to
show
the
grandson
of
the
palatine
of
masovia
the
warm
gratitude
of
a
briton
heart
indeed
sobieski
you
will
love
him
for
he
is
generous
and
noble
like
your
inestimable
grandfather
besides
added
he
smiling
with
a
sudden
recollection
there
is
my
lovely
cousin
mary
beaufort
who
i
verily
believe
will
fly
into
your
arms
the
blood
rushed
over
the
cheeks
of
thaddeus
at
this
speech
of
his
friend
and
suppressing
a
bitter
sigh
he
shook
his
head
do
look
so
like
an
infidel
resumed
somerset
if
you
have
any
doubts
of
possessing
her
most
precious
feelings
i
can
put
you
out
of
your
suspense
by
a
single
sentence
when
lady
dundas
household
with
myself
amongst
them
for
little
did
i
suspect
i
was
joining
the
cry
against
my
friend
were
asserting
the
most
flagrant
instances
of
your
deceit
to
euphemia
mary
alone
withstood
the
tide
of
malice
and
compelled
me
to
release
you
gracious
providence
cried
thaddeus
catching
pembroke
hand
and
looking
eagerly
and
with
agitation
in
his
face
was
it
you
who
came
to
my
prison
was
it
miss
beaufort
who
visited
my
lodgings
indeed
it
was
returned
his
friend
and
i
blush
for
my
self
that
i
quitted
newgate
without
an
interview
had
i
followed
the
dictates
of
common
courtesy
in
the
fulfilment
of
my
commission
i
should
have
seen
you
and
then
what
pain
would
have
been
spared
my
dear
cousin
what
a
joyful
surprise
would
have
awaited
myself
thaddeus
could
only
reply
by
pressing
his
friend
hand
his
brain
whirled
he
could
not
decide
on
the
nature
of
his
feelings
one
moment
he
would
have
given
worlds
to
throw
himself
at
miss
feet
and
the
next
he
trembled
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
her
so
soon
dear
sobieski
cried
pembroke
how
strangely
you
receive
this
intelligence
is
it
possible
such
sentiments
from
mary
beaufort
can
be
regarded
by
a
soul
like
yours
with
coldness
o
no
cried
the
count
his
fine
face
flushed
with
emotion
i
adore
miss
beaufort
her
virtues
possess
my
whole
heart
but
can
i
forget
that
i
have
only
that
heart
to
offer
can
i
forget
that
i
am
a
beggar
that
even
now
i
exist
on
her
bounty
the
eyes
of
thaddeus
and
the
sudden
tremor
which
shook
his
frame
finished
this
appeal
to
his
fate
pembroke
found
it
enter
his
soul
to
hide
its
effect
he
threw
himself
on
his
friend
breast
and
exclaimed
do
not
injure
me
and
my
father
by
such
thoughts
you
are
come
dearest
sobieski
to
a
second
home
sir
robert
somerset
will
consider
himself
ennobled
in
supplying
the
place
of
your
lamented
grandfather
in
endowing
you
like
a
son
oh
thaddeus
you
must
be
my
cousin
dear
as
a
brother
as
well
as
my
friend
thaddeus
replied
with
an
agitated
affection
as
true
as
that
of
the
generous
speaker
but
added
he
i
must
not
allow
the
noble
heart
of
my
now
regained
somerset
to
believe
that
i
can
live
a
dependant
on
any
power
but
the
author
of
my
being
therefore
if
sir
robert
somerset
will
assist
me
to
procure
some
unobtrusive
way
of
acquiring
my
own
support
in
the
simplicity
i
wish
i
shall
thank
him
from
my
soul
in
no
other
way
my
kindest
friend
can
i
ever
be
brought
to
tax
the
munificence
of
your
father
pembroke
colored
at
this
and
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
distress
and
displeasure
sobieski
what
can
you
mean
do
you
imagine
that
ever
my
father
or
myself
can
forget
that
you
were
little
less
than
a
prince
in
your
own
country
that
when
in
so
high
a
station
you
treated
me
like
a
brother
that
you
preserved
me
even
when
i
lifted
my
arm
against
your
life
can
we
be
such
monsters
as
to
forget
all
this
or
to
think
that
we
act
justly
by
you
in
permitting
you
to
labor
for
your
bread
no
thaddeus
my
very
soul
spurns
the
idea
your
mother
sheltered
me
as
a
son
and
i
insist
that
you
allow
my
father
to
perform
the
same
part
by
you
besides
you
shall
not
be
idle
you
may
have
a
commission
in
the
army
and
i
will
follow
you
the
count
pressed
the
hand
of
his
friend
and
looking
gratefully
but
mournfully
in
his
face
replied
had
i
a
hundred
tongues
my
generous
pembroke
i
could
not
express
my
sense
of
your
friendship
it
is
indeed
a
cordial
to
my
heart
it
imparts
to
me
an
earnest
of
happiness
which
i
thought
had
fled
forever
but
it
shall
not
allure
me
from
my
principles
i
am
resolved
not
to
live
a
life
of
indolent
uselessness
and
i
can
not
at
this
period
enter
the
british
army
no
added
he
emotion
elevating
his
tone
and
manner
rather
would
i
toil
for
subsistence
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
than
be
subjected
to
the
necessity
of
acting
in
concert
with
those
ravagers
who
destroyed
my
country
i
can
not
fight
by
the
side
of
the
allied
powers
who
dismembered
it
i
can
not
enlist
under
the
allies
i
will
not
be
led
out
to
devastation
mine
was
and
ever
shall
be
a
defensive
sword
and
should
danger
threaten
england
i
would
be
as
ready
to
withstand
her
enemies
as
i
ardently
though
ineffectually
opposed
those
of
unhappy
poland
pembroke
recognized
the
devoted
soul
of
thaddeus
of
warsaw
in
this
lofty
burst
of
enthusiasm
and
aware
that
his
father
munificence
and
manner
of
conferring
it
would
go
further
towards
removing
these
scruples
than
all
his
own
arguments
he
did
not
attempt
to
combat
a
resolution
which
he
knew
he
could
not
subdue
but
tried
to
prevail
with
him
to
become
his
guest
until
something
could
be
arranged
to
suit
his
wishes
with
an
unuttered
emotion
at
the
thought
of
meeting
miss
beaufort
thaddeus
had
just
consented
to
accompany
somerset
to
the
castle
after
sir
robert
had
been
apprized
of
his
coming
when
the
old
and
faithfully
attached
manservant
entered
and
respectfully
informed
her
guests
that
his
lady
not
willing
to
disturb
their
conversation
had
retired
to
her
room
for
the
night
but
that
beds
were
prepared
for
them
in
the
abbey
and
she
hoped
to
meet
both
friends
at
her
breakfast
table
in
the
morning
the
honest
man
then
added
it
was
now
past
eleven
and
after
their
honors
had
partaken
of
their
yet
untasted
refreshment
he
would
be
ready
to
attend
them
to
their
chambers
pembroke
started
up
at
this
and
shaking
his
friend
warm
by
the
hand
bade
him
he
said
a
short
farewell
and
hastening
down
the
hill
arrived
at
the
gate
of
the
wold
lodge
just
at
the
turn
of
midnight
at
an
early
hour
the
next
morning
he
gave
orders
to
his
groom
wrote
a
slight
apology
to
shafto
for
his
abrupt
departure
and
mounting
his
fleet
horse
galloped
away
full
of
delight
towards
somerset
castle
chapter
xl
somerset
castle
but
sobieski
did
not
follow
the
attentive
domestic
of
his
maternal
friend
to
the
prepared
apartment
in
the
abbey
he
asked
to
be
conducted
back
through
the
night
shadowed
grounds
to
the
little
hotel
he
had
seen
early
in
the
evening
on
his
approach
to
the
mansion
it
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
adjoining
village
and
under
its
rustic
porch
he
had
immediately
entered
to
engage
a
lodging
beneath
its
humble
sign
the
plough
for
the
few
clays
of
his
intended
visit
to
lady
tinemouth
a
boy
had
been
his
guide
and
bearer
of
his
small
travelling
bag
from
the
famous
old
commandery
inn
the
angel
at
grantham
where
the
wold
diligence
had
set
him
down
in
the
afternoon
at
the
top
of
the
of
that
memorable
town
of
ancient
chivalry
to
find
his
way
up
to
the
occasional
rural
palace
cells
on
harrowby
hill
of
the
same
doughty
and
luxurious
knights
who
were
now
lying
individually
forgotten
in
their
not
only
silent
but
unknown
graves
there
not
being
a
trace
of
them
amongst
the
chapel
ruins
of
the
abbey
nor
below
the
hill
on
the
sight
of
the
old
commandery
church
at
grantham
ah
transit
mundi
exclaimed
thaddeus
to
himself
with
a
calmed
sigh
as
he
thought
on
those
things
while
resting
under
the
modest
little
portal
of
the
hotel
whose
former
magnificence
when
a
hermit
cell
might
still
be
discernible
in
a
few
remaining
remnants
of
the
rich
gothic
lintel
yet
mingling
with
the
matted
straw
and
the
clinging
ivy
of
the
thatch
what
art
thou
world
and
thine
ambitions
again
echoed
in
silence
from
the
heart
of
thaddeus
though
yet
so
young
i
have
seen
thee
in
all
thy
phases
which
might
wean
me
from
this
earth
but
there
are
still
some
beings
dear
to
me
in
the
dimmed
aspect
that
seem
to
hold
my
hopes
to
this
transitory
and
yet
too
lovely
world
he
was
then
thinking
of
his
restored
friend
pembroke
somerset
and
of
her
whose
name
had
been
so
fondly
uttered
by
him
as
a
possible
bond
of
their
still
more
intimate
relationship
he
tried
to
quell
the
wild
hope
this
recollection
waked
in
his
bosom
and
hurried
from
the
little
parlor
of
the
inn
where
lady
tinemouth
old
servant
had
left
him
to
seek
repose
in
his
chamber
at
sight
of
its
bed
and
simple
furniture
and
instantly
conscious
to
the
balmy
effects
of
the
sweet
freshness
that
breathed
around
him
where
no
perfume
but
that
of
flowers
ever
entered
his
agitated
feelings
soon
became
soothed
into
serenity
and
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
he
had
laid
his
grateful
head
on
that
quiet
pillow
he
had
sunk
to
a
sleep
of
gentle
peace
with
man
and
heaven
next
morning
when
the
countess
met
her
gladly
guest
at
the
she
expressed
surprise
and
pleasure
at
the
scene
of
the
preceding
night
but
intimated
some
mortification
that
he
had
withheld
any
part
of
his
confidence
from
her
sobieski
soon
obtained
her
pardon
by
relating
the
manner
of
his
first
meeting
with
somerset
in
poland
and
the
consequent
events
of
that
momentous
period
lady
tinemouth
wept
over
the
distressful
fate
that
marked
the
residue
of
his
narrative
with
a
tenderness
which
yet
more
endeared
her
to
his
soul
but
when
in
compliance
with
his
inquiries
she
informed
him
how
it
happened
that
he
had
to
seek
her
at
harrowby
abbey
when
he
supposed
her
to
be
on
the
wolds
it
was
his
turn
to
pity
and
to
shudder
at
his
own
consanguinity
with
lord
harwold
indeed
added
the
countess
wishing
to
turn
from
the
painful
subject
you
must
have
had
a
most
tedious
journey
from
harwold
park
to
harrowby
and
nothing
but
my
pleasure
could
exceed
my
astonishment
when
i
met
you
last
night
on
the
hill
thaddeus
sincerely
declared
that
travelling
a
few
miles
further
than
he
intended
was
no
fatigue
to
him
yet
were
it
otherwise
the
happiness
which
he
then
enjoyed
would
have
acted
as
a
panacea
for
worse
ills
could
he
have
seen
her
looking
as
well
as
when
she
left
london
lady
tinemouth
smiled
you
are
right
sobieski
i
am
worse
than
when
i
was
in
town
my
solitary
journey
to
harwold
oppressed
me
and
when
my
son
sent
me
orders
to
leave
it
because
his
father
wanted
the
place
for
the
autumnal
months
his
capricious
cruelty
seemed
to
augment
the
hectic
of
my
distress
nevertheless
i
immediately
obeyed
and
in
augmented
disorder
arrived
here
last
week
but
how
kind
you
were
to
follow
me
who
informed
you
of
the
place
of
my
destination
hardly
any
of
lady
olivia
household
no
returned
thaddeus
i
luckily
had
the
precaution
to
inquire
at
the
inn
on
the
wolds
where
the
coach
stopped
what
part
of
lord
tinemouth
family
were
at
the
park
and
when
i
heard
that
the
earl
himself
was
there
my
next
question
was
where
then
was
the
countess
the
landlord
very
civilly
told
me
of
your
having
engaged
a
carriage
from
his
house
a
day
or
two
before
to
carry
you
to
one
of
his
lordship
seats
within
a
few
miles
of
somerset
castle
hence
from
what
i
heard
you
say
of
the
situation
of
harrowby
i
concluded
it
must
be
the
abbey
and
so
i
sought
you
at
a
venture
and
i
hope
a
happy
issue
replied
she
will
arise
from
your
wanderings
this
rencontre
with
so
old
a
friend
as
somerset
is
a
pleasing
omen
for
my
part
i
was
ignorant
of
the
arrival
of
the
family
at
the
castle
until
yesterday
morning
and
then
i
sent
off
a
messenger
to
apprize
my
dear
miss
beaufort
of
my
being
in
her
neighborhood
to
my
great
disappointment
lady
shafto
found
me
out
immediately
and
when
in
compliance
with
her
importunate
invitation
i
walked
down
to
an
early
dinner
with
her
yesterday
little
did
i
expect
to
meet
the
amiable
cousin
of
our
sweet
friend
so
delightful
an
accident
has
amply
repaid
me
for
the
pain
i
endured
in
seeing
miss
dundas
at
the
lodge
an
insolent
and
reproachful
letter
which
she
wrote
to
me
concerning
you
has
rendered
her
an
object
of
my
aversion
thaddeus
smiled
and
gently
bent
his
head
since
my
dear
lady
tinemouth
her
groundless
malice
and
miss
euphemia
folly
have
failed
in
estranging
either
your
confidence
or
the
esteem
of
miss
beaufort
from
me
i
pardon
them
both
perhaps
i
ought
to
pity
them
for
is
it
not
difficult
to
pass
through
the
brilliant
snares
of
wealth
and
adulation
and
emerge
pure
as
when
we
entered
them
unclouded
fortune
is
indeed
a
trial
of
spirits
and
how
brightly
does
miss
beaufort
rise
from
the
blaze
surrounded
by
splendor
homage
and
indulgence
she
is
yet
all
nature
gentleness
and
virtue
the
latter
part
of
this
burst
of
heart
he
uttered
rapidly
the
nerves
of
that
heart
beating
full
at
every
word
the
countess
who
wished
to
appear
cheerful
rallied
him
on
the
warmth
of
his
expressions
and
observing
that
the
day
was
fine
invited
him
to
walk
out
with
her
through
the
romantic
though
neglected
domains
of
the
abbey
meanwhile
the
family
at
somerset
were
just
drawn
round
the
when
they
were
agreeably
surprised
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
pembroke
during
the
repast
miss
beaufort
repeated
the
contents
of
the
note
she
had
received
the
preceding
day
from
lady
tinemouth
and
requested
that
her
cousin
would
be
kind
enough
to
drive
her
in
his
curricle
that
morning
to
harrowby
i
will
with
pleasure
answered
he
i
have
seen
her
ladyship
and
even
supped
with
her
last
night
how
came
that
asked
miss
dorothy
i
shall
explain
it
to
my
father
whenever
he
will
honor
me
with
an
audience
returned
her
happy
nephew
addressing
the
baronet
with
all
the
joy
of
his
heart
looking
out
at
his
eyes
will
you
indulge
me
dear
sir
by
half
an
hour
attention
certainly
replied
sir
robert
at
present
i
am
going
into
my
study
to
settle
my
steward
books
but
the
moment
i
have
finished
i
will
send
for
you
miss
dorothy
walked
out
after
her
brother
to
attend
her
aviary
and
miss
beaufort
remaining
alone
with
her
cousin
made
some
inquiries
about
the
countess
reasons
for
coming
to
the
abbey
i
know
nothing
about
them
replied
he
gayly
for
she
went
to
bed
almost
the
instant
i
entered
the
house
too
good
to
remain
where
her
company
was
not
wanted
she
left
me
to
enjoy
a
most
delightful
with
a
dear
friend
from
whom
i
parted
nearly
four
years
ago
in
short
we
sat
up
the
whole
night
together
talking
over
past
scenes
and
present
ones
too
for
i
assure
you
you
were
not
forgotten
i
what
had
i
to
do
with
it
replied
mary
smiling
i
can
not
recollect
any
dear
friend
of
yours
whom
you
have
not
seen
these
four
years
well
that
is
strange
answered
pembroke
he
remembers
you
perfectly
but
true
to
your
sex
you
affirm
what
you
please
though
i
know
there
is
not
a
man
in
the
world
i
prefer
before
him
miss
beaufort
shook
her
head
laughed
and
sighed
and
withdrawing
her
hand
from
his
threatened
to
leave
him
if
he
would
not
be
serious
i
am
serious
cried
he
would
you
have
me
that
i
have
seen
him
whom
you
most
wish
to
see
she
regarded
the
expression
of
his
countenance
with
a
momentary
emotion
taking
her
seat
again
she
said
you
can
have
seen
no
one
that
is
of
consequence
to
me
whoever
your
friend
may
be
i
have
only
to
congratulate
you
on
a
meeting
which
affords
you
so
much
delight
pembroke
burst
into
a
joyous
laugh
at
her
composure
so
cold
cried
he
so
cautious
yet
i
verily
believe
you
would
participate
in
my
delights
were
i
to
tell
you
who
he
is
however
you
are
such
a
skeptic
that
i
wont
hint
even
one
of
the
many
fine
things
he
said
of
you
she
smiled
incredulously
i
could
beat
you
mary
exclaimed
he
for
this
oblique
way
of
saying
i
am
telling
lies
but
i
will
have
my
revenge
on
your
curiosity
for
on
my
honor
i
declare
added
he
emphatically
that
last
night
i
met
with
a
friend
at
lady
tinemouth
who
four
years
ago
saved
my
life
who
entertained
me
several
weeks
in
his
house
and
who
has
seen
and
adores
you
tis
true
true
on
my
existence
and
what
is
more
i
have
promised
that
you
will
repay
these
weighty
obligations
by
the
free
gift
of
this
dear
hand
what
do
you
say
to
this
my
sweet
mary
miss
beaufort
looked
anxious
at
the
serious
and
energetic
manner
in
which
he
made
those
assertions
even
the
sportive
kiss
that
ended
the
question
did
not
dispel
the
gravity
with
which
she
prepared
to
reply
pembroke
perceiving
her
intent
prevented
her
by
exclaiming
cease
mary
cease
i
see
you
are
going
to
make
a
false
statement
let
truth
prevail
and
you
will
not
deny
that
i
am
suing
for
a
plighted
faith
you
will
not
deny
who
it
was
that
softened
and
subdued
your
heart
you
can
not
conceal
from
me
that
the
wanderer
constantine
possesses
your
affections
amazed
at
so
extraordinary
a
charge
from
her
hitherto
always
respectful
as
well
as
fraternally
affectionate
cousin
she
reddened
with
pain
and
displeasure
rising
from
her
seat
and
averting
her
tearful
eyes
she
said
i
did
not
expect
this
cruel
this
ungenerous
speech
from
you
pembroke
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
so
rude
so
unfeeling
a
reproach
pembroke
threw
his
arm
round
her
come
said
he
in
a
sportive
voice
do
be
tragical
i
never
meant
to
reproach
you
mary
i
dare
say
if
you
gave
your
heart
it
was
only
in
return
for
his
i
know
you
are
a
grateful
girl
and
i
verily
believe
you
wo
find
much
difference
between
my
friend
the
young
count
sobieski
and
the
forlorn
constantine
a
suspicion
of
the
truth
flashed
across
miss
beaufort
mind
unable
to
speak
she
caught
hold
of
her
cousin
hands
and
looking
eagerly
in
his
face
her
eyes
declared
the
question
she
would
have
asked
pembroke
laughed
triumphantly
a
servant
entering
to
tell
him
that
sir
robert
was
ready
he
strained
her
to
his
breast
and
exclaimed
now
i
am
revenged
farewell
i
leave
you
to
all
the
pangs
of
doubt
and
curiosity
he
then
flew
out
of
the
room
with
an
arch
glance
at
her
agitated
countenance
and
hurried
up
stairs
she
clasped
her
trembling
hands
together
as
the
door
closed
on
him
o
gracious
providence
cried
she
what
am
i
to
understand
by
this
mystery
this
joy
of
my
cousin
can
it
be
possible
that
the
illustrious
sobieski
and
my
contemned
constantine
are
the
same
person
a
burning
blush
overspread
her
face
at
the
expression
which
had
escaped
her
lips
whilst
the
graces
the
sweetness
the
dignity
of
thaddeus
had
captivated
her
notice
his
sufferings
his
virtues
and
the
mysterious
interests
which
involved
his
history
in
like
manner
had
fixed
her
attention
had
awakened
her
esteem
from
these
grounds
the
step
is
short
to
love
when
the
mind
is
conquered
the
heart
surrenders
at
discretion
but
she
knew
not
that
she
had
advanced
too
far
to
retreat
until
the
last
scene
at
dundas
house
by
forcing
her
to
defend
constantine
against
the
charge
of
loving
her
made
her
confess
to
herself
how
much
she
wished
the
charge
were
true
poor
and
lowly
as
he
seemed
she
found
that
her
whole
heart
and
life
were
wrapped
in
his
remembrance
that
his
worshipped
idea
was
her
solace
her
most
precious
property
the
dear
treasure
of
her
secret
and
sweetest
felicity
it
was
the
companion
of
her
walks
the
monitor
of
her
actions
whenever
she
planned
whenever
she
executed
she
asked
herself
how
would
constantine
consider
this
and
accordingly
did
she
approve
or
condemn
her
conduct
for
she
had
heard
enough
from
robson
to
convince
her
that
piety
was
the
sure
fountain
of
his
virtues
when
she
had
left
london
and
so
far
separated
from
this
idol
of
her
memory
such
was
the
impression
he
had
stamped
on
her
heart
he
seemed
ever
present
the
shade
of
laura
visited
the
solitude
of
vaucluse
the
image
of
constantine
haunted
the
walks
of
somerset
the
loveliness
of
nature
its
leafy
groves
and
verdant
meadows
its
blooming
mornings
and
luxuriant
sunsets
the
romantic
shadows
of
twilight
or
the
soft
glories
of
the
moon
and
stars
as
they
pressed
beauty
and
sentiment
upon
her
heart
awoke
it
to
the
remembrance
of
constantine
she
saw
his
image
she
felt
his
soul
in
every
object
subtile
and
undefinable
is
that
ethereal
chord
which
unites
our
tenderest
thought
with
their
chain
of
association
before
this
conversation
in
which
pembroke
mentioned
the
name
of
constantine
with
so
much
badinage
and
apparent
familiarity
he
never
heard
him
spoken
of
by
mary
or
his
aunt
without
declaring
a
displeasure
nearly
amounting
to
anger
hence
when
she
considered
his
now
so
strangely
altered
tone
miss
beaufort
necessarily
concluded
that
he
had
seen
in
the
person
of
him
she
most
valued
the
man
whose
public
character
she
had
often
heard
him
admire
and
who
she
now
doubted
not
had
at
some
former
period
given
him
some
private
reason
for
calling
him
his
friend
before
this
time
she
more
than
once
had
suspected
from
the
opinions
which
somerset
occasionally
repeated
respecting
the
affairs
of
poland
that
he
could
only
have
acquired
so
accurate
a
knowledge
of
its
events
by
having
visited
the
country
itself
she
mentioned
her
suspicion
to
loftus
he
denied
the
fact
and
she
had
thought
no
more
on
the
subject
until
the
present
ambiguous
hints
of
her
cousin
conjured
up
these
doubts
anew
and
led
her
to
suppose
that
if
pembroke
had
not
disobeyed
his
father
so
far
as
to
go
to
warsaw
he
must
have
met
with
the
count
sobieski
in
some
other
realm
the
possibility
that
this
young
hero
of
whom
fame
spoke
so
loudly
might
be
the
mysterious
constantine
bewildered
and
delighted
her
the
more
she
compared
what
she
had
heard
of
the
one
with
what
she
had
witnessed
in
the
other
the
more
was
she
reconciled
to
the
probability
of
her
ardent
hope
besides
she
could
not
for
a
moment
retain
a
belief
that
her
cousin
would
so
cruelly
sport
with
her
delicacy
and
peace
as
to
excite
expectations
that
he
could
not
fulfil
agitated
by
a
suspense
which
bordered
on
agony
with
a
beating
heart
she
heard
his
quick
step
descending
the
stairs
the
door
opened
and
pembroke
flying
into
the
room
caught
up
his
hat
as
he
was
darting
away
again
unable
to
restrain
her
impatience
miss
beaufort
with
an
imploring
voice
ejaculated
his
name
he
turned
and
displayed
to
her
amazed
sight
a
countenance
in
which
no
vestige
of
his
former
animation
could
be
traced
his
cheek
was
flushed
and
his
eyes
shot
a
wild
fire
that
struck
to
her
heart
unconscious
what
she
did
she
ran
up
to
him
but
pembroke
pushing
her
back
exclaimed
do
ask
me
any
questions
if
you
would
not
drive
me
to
madness
o
heaven
cried
she
catching
his
arm
and
clinging
to
him
while
the
eagerness
of
his
motion
dragged
her
into
the
hall
tell
me
has
anything
happened
to
my
guardian
to
your
friend
to
constantine
no
replied
he
looking
at
her
with
a
face
full
of
desperation
but
my
father
commands
me
to
treat
him
like
a
villain
she
could
hardly
credit
her
senses
at
this
confirmation
that
constantine
and
sobieski
were
one
turning
giddy
with
the
tumultuous
delight
that
rushed
over
her
soul
she
staggered
back
a
few
paces
and
leaning
against
the
open
door
tried
to
recover
breath
to
regain
the
room
she
had
left
pembroke
having
escaped
from
her
grasp
ran
furiously
down
the
hill
mounted
his
horse
and
forbidding
any
groom
to
attend
him
galloped
towards
the
high
road
with
the
impetuosity
of
a
madman
all
the
powers
of
his
soul
were
in
arms
wounded
dishonored
stigmatized
with
ingratitude
and
baseness
he
believed
himself
to
be
the
most
degraded
of
men
it
appeared
that
sir
robert
somerset
had
long
cherished
a
hatred
to
the
poles
in
consequence
of
some
injury
he
affirmed
he
had
received
in
early
youth
from
one
of
that
nation
in
this
instance
his
dislike
was
implacable
and
when
his
son
set
out
for
the
continent
he
positively
forbade
him
to
enter
poland
notwithstanding
his
remembrance
of
this
violated
injunction
when
pembroke
joined
the
baronet
in
his
library
he
did
it
with
confidence
with
a
bounding
heart
and
animated
countenance
he
recapitulated
how
he
had
been
wrought
upon
by
his
young
russian
friends
to
take
up
arms
in
their
cause
and
march
into
poland
at
these
last
words
his
father
turned
pale
and
though
he
did
not
speak
the
denunciation
was
on
his
brow
pembroke
who
expected
some
marks
of
displeasure
hastened
to
obliterate
his
disobedience
by
narrating
the
event
which
had
introduced
not
only
the
young
count
sobieski
to
his
succor
but
the
consequent
friendship
of
the
whole
of
that
princely
family
sir
robert
still
made
no
verbal
reply
but
his
countenance
deepened
in
gloom
and
when
pembroke
with
all
the
pathos
of
a
deep
regret
attempted
to
describe
the
death
of
the
palatine
the
horrors
which
attended
the
last
hours
of
the
countess
and
the
succeeding
misery
of
thaddeus
who
was
now
in
england
no
language
can
paint
the
frenzy
which
burst
at
once
from
the
baronet
he
stamped
on
the
ground
he
covered
his
face
with
his
clenched
hands
then
turning
on
his
son
with
a
countenance
no
longer
recognizable
he
exclaimed
with
fury
pembroke
you
have
outraged
my
commands
never
will
i
pardon
you
if
that
young
man
ever
blasts
me
with
his
sight
merciful
heaven
cried
pembroke
thunderstruck
at
a
violence
which
he
almost
wished
might
proceed
from
real
madness
surely
something
has
agitated
my
father
what
can
this
mean
sir
robert
shook
his
head
whilst
his
teeth
ground
against
each
other
do
mistake
me
replied
he
in
a
firm
voice
i
am
perfectly
in
my
senses
it
depends
on
that
i
continue
so
you
know
my
oath
against
all
of
that
nation
and
i
repeat
again
if
you
ever
bring
that
young
man
into
my
presence
you
shall
never
see
me
more
a
cold
dew
overspread
the
body
of
pembroke
he
would
have
caught
his
father
hand
but
he
held
it
back
o
sir
said
he
you
surely
can
not
intend
that
i
shall
treat
with
ingratitude
the
man
who
saved
my
life
sir
robert
did
not
vouchsafe
him
an
answer
but
continued
walking
up
and
down
the
room
until
his
hesitation
increasing
at
every
step
he
opened
the
door
of
an
interior
apartment
and
retired
bidding
his
son
remain
where
he
left
him
the
pembroke
waited
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
his
father
when
he
did
appear
the
deep
gloom
of
his
eye
gave
no
encouragement
to
his
son
who
hanging
down
his
head
recoiled
from
speaking
first
sir
robert
approached
with
a
composed
but
severe
countenance
and
said
i
have
been
seeking
every
palliation
that
your
conduct
might
admit
but
i
can
find
none
before
you
quitted
england
you
knew
well
my
abhorrence
of
poland
one
of
that
country
many
years
ago
wounded
my
happiness
in
a
way
i
shall
never
recover
from
that
hour
i
took
an
oath
never
to
enter
its
borders
and
never
to
suffer
one
of

come
within
my
doors
rash
disobedient
boy
you
know
my
disposition
and
you
have
seen
the
emotion
with
which
this
dilemma
has
shaken
my
soul
i
but
be
it
on
your
own
head
that
you
have
incurred
obligations
which
i
can
not
repay
i
will
not
perjure
myself
to
defray
a
debt
contracted
against
my
positive
and
declared
principles
i
never
will
see
this
polander
you
speak
of
and
it
is
my
express
command
on
pain
of
my
eternal
malediction
that
you
break
with
him
entirely
pembroke
fell
into
a
seat
sir
robert
proceeded
i
pity
your
distress
but
my
resolution
can
not
be
shaken
oaths
are
not
to
be
broken
with
impunity
you
must
either
resign
him
or
resign
me
we
may
compromise
your
debt
of
gratitude
i
will
give
you
deeds
to
put
your
friend
in
possession
of
five
hundred
pounds
for
life
forever
nay
i
would
even
double
it
to
give
you
satisfaction
but
from
the
hour
in
which
you
tell
him
so
you
must
see
him
no
more
sir
robert
was
quitting
the
room
when
pembroke
starting
from
his
chair
threw
himself
in
agony
on
his
knees
and
catching
by
the
skirt
of
his
father
coat
implored
him
for
god
sake
to
recall
his
words
to
remember
that
he
was
affixing
everlasting
dishonor
on
his
son
remember
dear
sir
cried
he
holding
his
struggling
hand
that
the
man
to
whom
you
offer
money
as
a
compensation
for
insult
is
of
a
nature
too
noble
to
receive
it
he
will
reject
it
and
spurn
me
and
i
shall
know
that
i
deserve
his
scorn
for
mercy
sake
spare
me
the
agony
of
harrowing
up
the
heart
of
my
preserver
of
meeting
reproach
from
his
eyes
leave
me
cried
the
baronet
breaking
from
him
i
repeat
unless
you
wish
to
incur
my
curse
do
as
i
have
commanded
thus
outraged
thus
agonised
pembroke
had
appeared
before
the
eyes
of
his
cousin
mary
more
like
a
distracted
creature
than
a
man
possessed
of
his
senses
shortly
after
his
abrupt
departure
her
apprehension
was
petrified
to
a
dreadful
certainty
of
some
cruel
ruin
to
her
hopes
by
an
order
she
received
in
the
handwriting
of
her
uncle
commanding
her
not
to
attempt
visiting
lady
tinemouth
whilst
the
count
sobieski
continued
to
be
her
guest
and
under
peril
of
his
displeasure
never
to
allow
that
name
to
pass
her
lips
hardly
knowing
whither
he
went
pembroke
did
not
arrive
at
the
ruined
aisle
which
leads
to
the
habitable
part
of
the
abbey
until
near
three
he
inquired
of
the
groom
that
took
his
horse
whether
the
countess
and
constantine
were
at
home
the
man
replied
in
the
affirmative
but
added
with
a
sad
countenance
he
feared
neither
of
them
could
be
seen
for
what
reason
demanded
somerset
alas
sir
replied
the
servant
about
an
hour
ago
my
lady
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
which
ended
in
the
rupture
of
a
it
continued
to
flow
so
long
that
constantine
told
the
apothecary
whom
he
had
summoned
to
send
for
a
physician
the
doctor
is
not
yet
arrived
and
constantine
wo
leave
my
lady
though
somerset
was
truly
concerned
at
the
illness
of
the
countess
the
respite
it
afforded
him
from
immediately
declaring
the
ungrateful
message
of
sir
robert
gave
him
no
inconsiderable
degree
of
ease
somewhat
relieved
by
the
hope
of
being
for
one
day
spared
the
anguish
of
displaying
his
father
in
a
disgraceful
light
he
entered
the
abbey
and
desired
that
a
might
be
sent
to
her
ladyship
room
to
inform
his
friend
that
somerset
was
below
in
a
few
minutes
the
girl
returned
with
the
following
lines
on
a
slip
of
paper
to
pembroke
somerset
esq
i
am
grieved
that
i
can
not
see
my
dear
somerset
i
fear
my
revered
friend
is
on
her
i
have
sent
for
cavendish
who
is
now
at
stanford
doubtless
you
know
he
is
a
man
of
the
first
abilities
if
human
skill
can
preserve
her
i
may
yet
have
hopes
but
her
disorder
is
on
the
lung
and
in
the
heart
and
i
fear
the
stroke
is
sure
i
am
now
sitting
by
her
bedside
and
writing
what
she
dictates
to
her
husband
her
son
and
her
daughter
painful
you
may
believe
is
this
task
i
can
not
my
dear
somerset
add
more
than
my
hope
of
seeing
you
soon
and
that
you
will
join
in
prayers
to
heaven
for
the
restoration
of
my
inestimable
friend
with
your
faithful
and
affectionate
sobieski
alas
unhappy
persecuted
sobieski
thought
pembroke
as
he
closed
the
paper
to
what
art
thou
doomed
some
friends
are
torn
from
thee
by
death
others
desert
thee
in
the
hour
of
trouble
he
took
out
his
pencil
to
answer
this
distressing
epistle
but
he
stopped
at
the
first
word
he
durst
not
write
that
his
father
would
fulfil
any
one
of
those
engagements
which
he
had
so
largely
promised
and
throwing
away
the
pencil
and
the
paper
he
left
a
verbal
declaration
of
his
sorrow
at
what
had
happened
and
an
assurance
of
calling
next
day
turning
his
back
on
a
house
which
he
had
left
on
the
preceding
night
with
so
many
joyful
hopes
he
remounted
his
horse
and
melancholy
and
slow
rode
about
the
country
until
evening
so
unwilling
was
he
to
return
to
that
home
which
now
threatened
him
with
the
frowns
of
his
father
the
tears
of
mary
beaufort
and
the
miserable
reflections
of
his
own
wretched
heart
chapter

the

doctor
cavendish
having
been
detained
beyond
his
expected
time
with
his
invalid
friend
at
stanford
was
happily
still
there
and
set
off
for
harrowby
the
instant
constanine
messenger
arrived
and
before
midnight
alighted
at
the
abbey
when
he
entered
lady
tinemouth
chamber
he
found
her
supported
in
the
arms
of
thaddeus
and
struggling
with
a
second
rupture
of
her
lungs
as
he
approached
the
bed
thaddeus
turned
his
eyes
on
him
with
an
expression
that
powerfully
told
his
fears
cavendish
silently
pressed
his
hand
then
taking
from
his
pocket
some
styptic
drops
he
made
the
countess
swallow
them
and
soon
saw
that
they
succeeded
in
stopping
the
hemorrhage
thaddeus
and
her
physician
remained
by
the
side
of
the
patient
sufferer
until
ten
in
the
morning
when
she
sunk
into
a
gentle
sleep
complete
stillness
being
necessary
to
continue
this
repose
the
good
doctor
proposed
leaving
the
maid
to
watch
by
her
ladyship
and
drawing
the
count
out
of
the
room
descended
the
stairs
somerset
had
been
arrived
half
an
hour
and
met
them
in
the
breakfast
parlor
after
a
few
kind
words
exchanged
between
the
parties
they
sat
down
with
dejected
countenances
to
their
melancholy
meal
thaddeus
was
too
much
absorbed
in
the
scene
he
had
left
to
take
anything
but
a
dish
of
coffee
do
you
think
lady
tinemouth
is
in
imminent
danger
inquired
pembroke
of
the
doctor
cavendish
sighed
and
turning
to
thaddeus
directed
to
him
the
answer
which
his
friend
question
demanded
i
am
afraid
my
dear
constantine
said
he
in
a
reluctant
voice
that
you
are
to
sustain
a
new
trial
i
fear
she
can
not
live
hours
thaddeus
cast
down
his
eyes
and
shuddered
but
made
no
reply
further
remarks
were
prevented
by
a
messenger
from
the
countess
who
desired
constantine
immediate
attendance
at
her
bedside
he
obeyed
in
half
an
hour
he
returned
with
the
mark
of
tears
upon
his
cheek
dearest
thaddeus
cried
pembroke
i
trust
the
countess
is
not
worse
this
threatened
new
bereavement
is
too
much
it
afflicts
my
very
heart
indeed
it
rent
it
for
pembroke
could
not
help
internally
acknowledging
that
when
sobieski
should
close
the
eyes
of
lady
tinemouth
he
would
be
paying
the
last
sad
office
to
his
last
friend
that
dear
distinction
he
durst
no
longer
arrogate
to
himself
denied
the
fulfilment
of
its
duties
he
thought
that
to
retain
the
title
would
be
an
assumption
without
a
right
thaddeus
drew
his
hand
over
his
again
filling
eyes
the
countess
herself
said
he
feels
the
truth
of
what
cavendish
told
us
she
sent
for
me
and
begged
me
as
i
loved
her
or
would
wish
to
see
her
die
in
peace
to
devise
some
means
for
bringing
her
daughter
to
the
abbey
as
for
lord
harwold
she
says
his
behavior
since
he
arrived
at
manhood
has
been
of
a
nature
so
cruel
and
unnatural
that
she
would
not
draw
on
herself
the
misery
nor
on
him
the
added
guilt
of
a
refusal
but
with
regard
to
lady
albina
who
has
been
no
sharer
in
those
barbarities
she
trusts
a
daughter
heart
might
be
prevailed
on
to
seek
a
last
embrace
from
a
dying
parent
it
is
this
request
continued
he
that
agitates
me
when
she
pictured
to
me
with
all
the
fervor
of
a
mother
her
doating
fondness
for
this
daughter
on
whom
whenever
she
did
venture
to
hope
all
those
hopes
rested
when
she
wrung
my
hand
and
besought
me
as
if
i
had
been
the
sole
disposer
of
her
fate
to
let
her
see
her
child
before
she
died
i
could
only
promise
every
exertion
to
effect
it
and
with
an
aching
heart
i
came
to
consult
you
cavendish
was
opening
his
lips
to
speak
but
somerset
in
his
eagerness
to
relieve
his
friend
did
not
perceive
it
and
immediately
answered
this
very
hour
i
will
undertake
what
you
have
promised
i
know
lord
tinemouth
family
are
now
at
the
wolds
it
is
only
thirty
miles
distant
i
will
send
a
servant
to
have
relays
of
horses
ready
my
curricle
which
is
now
at
the
door
will
be
more
convenient
than
a
chaise
and
i
will
engage
to
be
back
before
morning
write
a
letter
thaddeus
added
he
to
lady
albina
tell
her
of
her
mother
situation
and
though
i
have
never
seen
the
young
lady
i
will
give
it
into
her
own
hand
and
then
bring
her
off
even
were
it
in
the
face
of
her
villanous
father
the
pale
cheeks
of
sobieski
flushed
with
a
conscious
scarlet
turning
to
cavendish
he
requested
him
as
the
most
proper
person
to
write
to
lady
albina
whilst
he
would
walk
out
with
his
friend
to
order
the
carriage
pembroke
was
thanked
for
his
zeal
but
it
was
not
by
words
they
are
too
weak
vehicles
to
convey
strong
impressions
thaddeus
pressed
his
hand
and
accompanied
the
action
with
a
look
which
spoke
volumes
the
withered
heart
of
pembroke
expanded
under
the
animated
gratitude
of
his
friend
receiving
the
letter
he
sprang
into
his
seat
and
until
he
lost
sight
of
harrowby
hill
forgot
how
soon
he
must
appear
to
that
friend
the
most
ungrateful
of
men
it
was
near
six
in
the
evening
before
somerset
left
his
curricle
at
the
little
inn
which
skirts
the
village
of
harthorpe
he
affected
to
make
some
inquiries
respecting
the
families
in
the
neighborhood
and
his
host
informed
him
that
the
ladies
of
the
earl
family
were
great
walkers
passing
almost
the
whole
of
the
day
in
the
grounds
the
measures
to
be
adopted
were
now
obvious
the
paling
belonging
to
lord
tinemouth
park
was
only
a
few
yards
distant
but
fearful
of
being
observed
pembroke
sought
a
more
obscure
part
scaling
a
wall
which
was
covered
by
the
branches
of
high
trees
he
found
his
way
to
the
house
through
an
almost
impassable
thicket
he
watched
nearly
an
hour
in
vain
for
the
appearance
of
lady
albina
whose
youth
and
elegance
he
thought
would
unequivocally
distinguish
her
from
the
rest
of
the
earl
household
despairing
of
success
he
was
preparing
to
change
his
station
when
he
heard
a
sound
among
the
dry
leaves
and
the
next
moment
a
beautiful
young
creature
passed
the
bush
behind
which
he
was
concealed
the
fine
symmetry
of
her
profile
assured
him
that
she
must
be
the
daughter
of
lady
tinemouth
she
stooped
to
gather
a
knowing
that
no
time
should
be
lost
pembroke
gently
emerged
from
his
recess
but
not
in
so
quiet
a
manner
as
to
escape
the
ear
of
lady
albina
who
instantly
looking
round
screamed
and
would
have
fled
had
he
not
thrown
himself
before
her
and
exclaimed
stay
lady
albina
for
heaven
sake
stay
i
come
from
your
mother
she
gazed
fearfully
in
his
face
and
tried
to
release
her
hand
which
he
had
seized
to
prevent
her
flight
do
not
be
alarmed
continued
he
no
harm
is
intended
you
i
am
the
son
of
sir
robert
somerset
and
the
friend
of
your
mother
who
is
now
at
the
point
of
death
she
implores
to
see
you
this
night
for
she
has
hardly
an
hour
to
live
to
hear
from
your
own
lips
that
you
do
not
hate
her
lady
albina
trembled
dreadfully
and
with
faded
cheeks
and
quivering
lips
replied
hate
my
mother
oh
no
i
have
ever
dearly
loved
her
a
flood
of
tears
prevented
her
speaking
further
and
pembroke
perceiving
that
he
had
gained
her
confidence
put
the
doctor
letter
into
her
hand
the
gentle
heart
of
lady
albina
bled
at
every
word
which
her
almost
blinded
eyes
perused
turning
to
pembroke
who
stood
contemplating
her
lovely
countenance
with
the
deepest
interest
she
said
pray
somerset
take
me
now
to
my
mother
were
she
to
die
before
i
arrive
i
should
be
miserable
for
life
alas
alas
i
have
never
been
allowed
to
behold
her
never
been
allowed
to
visit
london
because
my
father
knew
that
i
believed
my
poor
mother
innocent
and
would
have
seen
her
had
it
been
possible
lady
albina
wept
violently
while
she
spoke
and
giving
her
hand
to
pembroke
timidly
looked
towards
the
house
and
added
you
must
take
me
this
instant
we
must
haste
away
in
case
we
should
be
surprised
if
lady
olivia
were
to
know
that
i
have
been
speaking
with
anybody
out
of
the
family
i
should
be
locked
up
for
months
pembroke
did
not
require
a
second
command
from
his
beautiful
charge
conducting
her
through
the
unfrequented
paths
by
which
he
had
entered
he
seated
her
in
his
curricle
and
whipping
his
horses
set
off
full
speed
towards
the
melancholy
goal
of
his
enterprise

abbey
whilst
the
two
anxious
travellers
were
pursuing
their
sad
journey
the
inhabitants
of
the
abbey
were
distracted
with
apprehension
lest
the
countess
might
expire
before
their
arrival
ever
since
lady
tinemouth
received
information
that
somerset
was
gone
to
the
wolds
hope
and
fear
agitated
her
by
turns
till
wearied
out
with
solicitude
and
expectation
she
turned
her
dim
eyes
upon
thaddeus
and
said
in
a
languid
voice
my
dear
friend
it
must
be
near
midnight
i
shall
never
see
the
morning
i
shall
never
in
this
world
see
my
child
i
pray
you
thank
somerset
for
all
the
trouble
i
have
occasioned
and
my
daughter
my
albina
o
father
of
mercies
cried
she
holding
up
her
clasped
hands
pour
all
thy
blessings
upon
her
head
she
never
wilfully
gave
this
broken
heart
a
pang
the
countess
had
hardly
ended
speaking
when
thaddeus
heard
a
bustle
on
the
stairs
suspecting
that
it
might
be
the
arrival
of
his
friend
he
made
a
sign
to
cavendish
to
go
and
inquire
his
heart
beat
violently
whilst
he
kept
his
eye
fixed
on
the
door
and
held
the
feeble
pulse
of
lady
tinemouth
in
his
hand
the
doctor
and
in
a
low
voice
whispered
lady
albina
is
here
the
words
acted
like
magic
on
the
fading
senses
of
the
countess
with
preternatural
strength
she
started
from
her
pillow
and
catching
hold
of
sobieski
arm
with
both
hers
cried
o
give
her
to
me
whilst
i
have
life
lady
albina
appeared
led
in
by
pembroke
but
instantly
quitting
his
hand
with
an
agonizing
shriek
she
rushed
towards
the
bed
and
flung
herself
into
the
extended
arms
of
her
mother
whose
arms
closed
on
her
and
the
head
of
the
countess
rested
on
her
bosom

the
struggles
of
the
young
lady
that
she
was
in
convulsions
and
taking
her
off
the
bed
he
consigned
her
to
pembroke
and
his
friend
who
between
them
carried
her
into
another
apartment
he
remained
to
assist
the
countess
albina
was
removed
but
the
eyes
of
her
amiable
and
injured
mother
were
never
again
unclosed
she
had
breathed
her
last
sigh
in
grateful
ecstasy
on
the
bosom
of
her
daughter
and
heaven
had
taken
her
spotless
soul
to
himself
being
convinced
that
the
countess
was
indeed
no
more
the
good
doctor
left
her
remains
in
charge
of
the
women
and
repairing
to
the
adjoining
room
found
lady
albina
yet
senseless
in
the
arms
of
his
two
friends
she
was
laid
on
a
sofa
and
cavendish
was
pouring
some
drops
into
her
mouth
when
he
descried
thaddeus
gliding
out
of
the
room
desirous
to
spare
him
the
shock
of
suddenly
seeing
the
corpse
of
one
whom
he
loved
so
truly
he
said
stop
constantine
i
conjure
you
do
not
go
into
the
countess
room
the
eyes
of
thaddeus
turned
with
emotion
on
the
distressed
face
of
the
physician
one
glance
explained
what
the
doctor
durst
not
speak
faintly
answering
i
will
obey
you
he
hurried
from
the
apartment
in
the
count
silent
descent
from
lady
albina
room
to
the
he
too
plainly
perceived
by
the
tears
of
the
servants
that
he
had
now
another
sorrow
to
add
to
his
mournful
list
he
hastened
from
participation
in
their
clamorous
laments
almost
unseen
into
the
parlor
and
shutting
the
door
threw
himself
into
a
chair
but
rest
induced
thought
and
thought
subdued
his
soul
he
started
from
his
position
he
paced
the
room
in
a
paroxysm
of
anguish
he
would
have
given
worlds
for
one
tear
to
relieve
his
oppressed
heart
ready
to
suffocate
he
threw
open
a
window
and
leaned
out
not
a
star
was
visible
to
light
the
darkness
the
wind
blew
freshly
and
with
parched
lips
he
inhaled
it
as
the
reviving
breath
of
heaven
he
was
sitting
on
the
with
his
head
leaning
against
the
casement
when
pembroke
entered
unobserved
walking
up
to
him
he
laid
his
hand
upon
his
arm
and
ejaculated
in
a
tremulous
voice
thaddeus
dear
thaddeus
thaddeus
rose
at
the
sounds
they
reminded
him
that
he
was
not
yet
alone
in
the
world
for
his
soul
had
been
full
of
the
dying
image
of
his
own
mother
clasping
somerset
in
his
arms
he
exclaimed
heaven
has
still
reserved
thee
faithful
and
beloved
to
be
my
comforter
in
thy
friendship
and
fond
memories
he
added
with
a
yet
heaving
breast
i
shall
find
tender
bonds
of
the
past
still
to
endear
me
to
the
world
pembroke
received
the
embrace
of
his
friend
he
felt
his
tears
upon
his
cheek
but
he
could
neither
return
the
one
nor
sympathize
with
the
other
the
conviction
that
he
was
soon
to
sever
that
cord
that
he
was
to
deprive
the
man
who
had
preserved
his
life
of
the
only
stay
of
his
existence
and
abandon
him
to
despair
struck
to
his
soul
grasping
the
hand
of
his
friend
he
gazed
on
his
averted
and
dejected
features
with
a
look
of
desperate
horror
sobieski
cried
he
whatever
may
happen
never
forget
that
i
swear
i
love
you
dearer
than
my
life
and
when
i
am
forced
to
abandon
my
friend
i
shall
not
be
long
of
abandoning
what
will
then
be
worthless
to
me
not
perceiving
the
frenzied
look
which
accompanied
this
energetic
declaration
thaddeus
gave
no
other
meaning
to
the
words
than
a
renewed
assurance
of
his
friend
affection
the
entrance
of
cavendish
disturbed
the
two
young
men
to
whom
he
communicated
the
increased
indisposition
of
lady
albina
the
shock
she
has
received
said
he
has
so
materially
shaken
her
frame
i
have
ordered
her
to
bed
and
administered
an
opiate
which
i
hope
will
procure
her
repose
and
you
my
dear
sir
added
he
addressing
the
count
you
had
better
seek
rest
the
stoutest
constitution
might
sink
under
what
you
have
lately
endured
pray
allow
somerset
and
myself
to
prevail
with
you
on
our
accounts
if
not
on
your
own
to
retire
for
half
an
hour
thaddeus
in
disregard
of
his
personal
comfort
never
infringed
on
that
of
others
he
felt
that
he
could
not
sleep
but
he
knew
it
would
gratify
his
benevolent
friends
to
suppose
that
he
did
and
accordingly
he
went
to
a
room
and
throwing
himself
on
a
bed
lay
for
an
hour
ruminating
on
all
that
had
passed
there
is
an
omnipresence
in
thought
or
a
celerity
producing
nearly
the
same
effect
which
brings
within
the
short
space
of
a
few
minutes
the
images
of
many
foregoing
years
in
almost
the
same
moment
thaddeus
reflected
on
his
strange
meeting
with
the
countess
the
melancholy
story
her
forlorn
the
fatal
secret
that
her
vile
husband
and
son
were
his
father
and
brother
and
that
her
daughter
whom
his
warm
heart
acknowledged
as
a
sister
was
with
him
under
the
same
roof
and
like
him
the
innocent
inheritor
of
her
father
shame
whilst
these
multifarious
and
painful
meditations
were
agitating
his
perturbed
mind
cavendish
found
repose
on
a
couch
and
pembroke
somerset
resolving
once
more
to
try
the
influence
of
entreaty
on
the
hitherto
generous
spirit
of
his
father
with
mingled
hope
and
despondence
commenced
a
last
attempt
to
shake
his
fatal
resolution
in
the
following
letter
to
sir
robert
somerset
bart
somerset
castle
i
have
not
ventured
into
the
presence
of
my
dear
father
since
he
uttered
the
dreadful
words
which
i
would
give
my
existence
to
believe
i
had
never
heard
you
denounced
a
curse
upon
me
if
i
opposed
your
will
to
have
me
break
all
connection
with
the
man
who
preserved
my
life
when
i
think
on
this
when
i
remember
that
it
was
from
i
received
a
command
so
inexplicable
from
one
of
your
character
so
disgraceful
to
mine
i
am
almost
mad
and
what
i
shall
be
should
you
by
repeating
your
injunctions
force
me
to
obey
them
heaven
only
knows
but
i
am
certain
that
i
can
not
survive
the
loss
of
my
honor
i
can
not
survive
the
sacrifice
of
all
my
principles
of
virtue
which
such
conduct
must
forever
destroy
oh
my
father
i
conjure
you
reflect
before
in
compliance
with
an
oath
it
was
almost
guilt
to
make
you
decree
your
only
son
to
everlasting
shame
and
remorse
act
how
i
will
i
shall
never
be
happy
more
i
can
not
live
under
your
malediction
and
should
i
give
up
my
friend
my
conscience
will
reproach
me
every
instant
of
my
existence
can
i
draw
the
breath
which
he
prolonged
and
cease
to
remember
that
i
have
abandoned
him
to
want
and
misery
it
were
vain
to
flatter
myself
that
he
will
condescend
to
escape
either
by
the
munificence
which
you
offer
as
a
compensation
for
my
friendship
no
i
can
not
believe
that
his
sensible
and
independent
nature
is
so
changed
circumstances
never
had
any
power
over
the
nobility
of
his
soul
misfortune
which
threw
the
count
sobieski
on
the
bounty
of
england
can
not
make
him
appear
otherwise
in
my
eyes
than
as
the
idol
of
warsaw
whose
smile
was
honor
and
whose
friendship
conferred
distinction
though
deprived
of
the
splendor
of
command
though
the
eager
circle
of
friends
no
longer
cluster
round
him
though
a
stranger
in
this
country
and
without
a
home
though
in
place
of
an
equipage
and
retinue
he
is
followed
by
calamit
and
neglect
yet
in
my
mind
i
still
see
him
in
a
car
of
triumph
i
see
not
only
the
opposer
of
his
nation
enemies
but
the
vanquisher
of
his
own
desires
i
see
the
heir
of
a
princely
house
who
when
mankind
have
deserted
him
is
yet
encompassed
by
his
virtues
i
see
him
though
cast
out
from
a
hardened
and
unjust
society
still
surrounded
by
the
lingering
spirits
of
those
who
were
called
to
better
worlds
and
this
is
the
man
my
dear
father
whom
i
am
sure
had
he
been
of
any
other
country
than
poland
you
would
have
selected
from
all
other
men
to
be
the
friend
and
example
of
your
son
this
is
he
whom
you
command
me
to
thrust
away
i
beseech
you
to
examine
this
injunction
i
am
now
writing
under
the
same
roof
with
him
it
depends
on
you
my
father
whether
i
am
doing
so
for
the
last
time
whether
this
is
the
last
day
in
which
your
son
is
to
consider
himself
a
man
of
honor
or
whether
he
is
henceforth
to
be
a
wretch
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
sorrow
i
have
not
yet
dared
to
utter
one
word
of
your
cruel
orders
to
my
unhappy
friend
he
is
now
retired
to
seek
some
rest
after
the
new
anguish
of
having
witnessed
the
almost
sudden
death
of
lady
tinemouth
should
i
have
to
tell
him
that
he
is
to
lose
me
i
can
not
add
more
your
own
heart
my
father
must
tell
you
that
my
soul
is
on
the
rack
until
i
have
an
answer
to
this
letter
before
i
shut
my
paper
let
me
implore
you
on
my
knees
whatever
you
may
decide
do
not
hate
me
do
not
load
my
breaking
heart
with
a
parent
curse
whatever
i
may
be
however
low
and
degraded
in
my
own
eyes
still
that
i
sacrificed
what
is
most
precious
to
me
to
my
father
will
impart
the
only
consolation
which
will
then
have
power
to
reach
your
dutiful
and
afflicted
son
somerset
harrowby
abbey
two
in
the
morning
cavendish
remained
in
a
profound
sleep
whilst
pembroke
with
an
aching
heart
having
written
the
above
letter
and
dispatched
it
by
a
man
and
horse
tried
to
compose
himself
to
half
an
forgetfulness
of
life
and
its
turmoils
but
he
found
his
attempts
as
ineffectual
as
those
of
his
friend
thaddeus
had
found
no
repose
on
his
restless
pillow
reluctant
to
disturb
the
doctor
and
somerset
who
he
hoped
having
less
cause
for
regret
were
sleeping
tranquilly
he
remained
in
bed
but
he
longed
for
morning
to
his
fevered
nerves
any
change
of
position
with
movement
seemed
better
than
where
he
was
and
with
some
gleams
of
pleasure
he
watched
the
dawn
and
the
rising
of
the
son
behind
the
opposite
hill
he
got
up
opened
the
window
to
inhale
the
air
and
looking
out
saw
a
man
throw
himself
off
a
horse
which
was
all
in
foam
and
enter
the
house
surprised
at
this
circumstance
he
descended
to
the
parlor
to
make
inquiry
and
met
the
man
in
the
hall
who
being
messenger
had
returned
express
from
the
castle
bearing
an
order
from
sir
robert
who
was
taken
alarmingly
ill
that
his
son
must
come
back
immediately
dismayed
with
this
new
distress
somerset
on
its
instant
information
pressed
the
count
so
closely
to
his
breast
when
he
bade
him
farewell
that
a
more
suspicious
person
might
have
apprehended
it
was
a
final
parting
but
thaddeus
discerned
nothing
more
in
the
anguish
of
his
friend
countenance
than
fear
for
the
safety
of
sir
robert
and
fervently
wishing
his
recovery
he
bade
pembroke
remember
that
should
more
assistance
be
necessary
cavendish
would
remain
at
the
abbey
until
lady
albina
return
to
the
wolds
somerset
being
gone
towards
noon
when
the
count
was
anxiously
awaiting
the
appearance
of
the
physician
from
the
room
of
the
new
invalid
he
was
disappointed
by
the
abrupt
entrance
of
two
gentlemen
he
rose
and
with
his
usual
courtesy
to
strangers
inquired
their
business
the
elder
of
the
men
with
a
fierce
countenance
and
a
voice
of
thunder
announced
himself
to
be
the
earl
of
tinemouth
and
the
other
his
son
we
are
come
said
he
standing
at
a
haughty
distance
we
are
come
to
carry
from
this
nest
of
infamy
lady
albina
stanhope
whom
some
one
of
her
mother
paramours
perhaps
you
sir
dared
to
steal
from
her
father
home
yesterday
evening
and
i
am
come
to
give
you
sir
who
i
guess
to
be
some
fugitive
vagabond
the
chastisement
your
audacity
deserves
with
difficulty
the
count
sobieski
suppressed
the
passions
which
were
rising
in
his
breast
he
turned
a
scornful
glance
on
the
person
of
lord
harwold
who
with
an
air
of
insufferable
derision
was
coolly
measuring
his
figure
through
an
eyeglass
and
then
replying
to
the
earl
said
in
a
firm
voice
my
lord
whoever
you
suppose
me
to
be
it
matters
not
i
now
stand
in
the
place
of
lady
confidential
friend
and
to
my
last
gasp
i
will
prove
myself
the
defender
of
he
injured
name
her
lover
interrupted
lord
harwold
turning
on
his
heel
her
defender
sir
repeated
thaddeus
with
a
tremendous
frown
and
shame
and
sorrow
will
pursue
that
son
who
requires
a
stranger
to
supply
his
duty
wretch
cried
the
earl
forgetting
his
assumed
loftiness
and
advancing
passionately
towards
thaddeus
with
his
stick
held
up
how
dare
you
address
such
language
to
an
english
nobleman
by
the
right
of
nature
which
holds
her
laws
over
all
mankind
returned
thaddeus
calmly
looking
on
the
raised
stick
when
an
english
nobleman
forgets
that
he
is
a
son
he
deserves
reproach
from
his
meanest
vassal
you
see
my
lord
cried
harwold
sliding
behind
his
father
what
we
bring
on
ourselves
by
harboring
these
democratic
foreigners
sir
added
he
addressing
himself
to
thaddeus
your
dangerous
principles
shall
be
communicated
to
government
such
traitors
ought
to
hanged
sobieski
eyed
the
enraged
little
lord
with
contempt
and
turning
to
the
earl
who
was
again
going
to
speak
he
said
in
an
unaltered
tone
i
can
not
guess
lord
tinemouth
what
is
the
reason
of
this
attack
on
me
i
came
hither
by
accident
i
found
the
countess
ill
and
from
respect
to
her
excellent
qualities
i
remained
with
her
until
her
eyes
were
closed
forever
she
desired
to
see
her
daughter
before
she
died
what
human
heart
could
deny
a
mother
such
a
request
and
pembroke
somerset
her
kinsman
undertook
to
bring
lady
albina
to
the
abbey
pembroke
somerset
echoed
the
earl
a
pretty
guard
for
my
daughter
truly
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
is
just
such
a
fellow
as
his
father
just
such
a
person
as
yourself
i
am
not
to
be
imposed
upon
i
know
lady
tinemouth
to
have
been
a
disgrace
to
me
and
you
to
be
that
german
adventurer
on
whose
account
i
sent
her
from
london
shocked
at
this
calumny
on
the
memory
of
a
woman
whose
fame
from
any
other
mouth
came
as
unsullied
as
purity
itself
thaddeus
gazed
with
horror
at
the
furious
countenance
of
the
man
whom
he
believed
to
be
his
father
his
heart
swelled
but
not
deigning
to
reply
to
a
charge
as
unmanly
as
it
was
false
he
calmly
took
out
of
his
pocket
two
letters
which
the
countess
had
dictated
to
her
husband
and
her
son
lord
harwold
tore
his
open
cast
his
eyes
over
the
first
words
then
crumpling
it
in
his
hand
threw
it
from
him
exclaiming
i
am
not
to
be
frightened
either
by
her
arts
or
the
falsehoods
of
the
fellows
with
whom
she
dishonored
her
name
thaddeus
no
longer
master
of
himself
sprang
towards
his
unnatural
son
and
seized
his
arm
with
an
iron
grasp
lord
harwold
cried
he
in
a
dreadful
voice
were
it
not
that
i
have
some
mercy
on
you
for
that
parent
sake
to
whom
like
a
parricide
you
are
giving
a
second
death
by
such
murderous
slander
i
would
resent
her
wrongs
at
the
hazard
of
your
worthless
life
my
lord
my
lord
cried
the
trembling
harwold
quaking
under
the
gripe
of
thaddeus
and
shrinking
from
the
terrible
brightness
of
his
eye
my
lord
my
lord
rescue
me
the
earl
almost
suffocated
with
rage
called
out
ruffian
let
go
my
son
and
again
raising
his
arm
aimed
a
blow
at
the
head
of
thaddeus
who
wrenching
the
stick
out
of
the
foaming
lord
hand
snapped
it
in
two
and
threw
the
pieces
out
of
the
open
window
lord
harwold
took
this
opportunity
to
ring
the
bell
violently
on
which
summons
two
of
his
servants
entered
the
room
now
you
insolent
scoundrel
cried
the
disarmed
earl
stamping
with
his
feet
and
pointing
to
the
men
who
stood
at
the
door
you
shall
be
turned
by
the
neck
and
heels
out
of
this
house
richard
james
collar
that
fellow
instantly
thaddeus
only
extended
his
arm
to
the
men
who
were
looking
confusedly
on
each
other
and
calmly
said
if
either
of
you
attempt
to
obey
this
command
of
your
lord
you
shall
have
cause
to
repent
it
the
men
retreated
the
earl
repeated
his
orders
rascals
do
as
i
command
you
or
instantly
quit
my
service
i
will
teach
you
added
he
clenching
his
fist
at
the
count
who
stood
resolutely
and
serenely
before
him
i
will
teach
you
how
to
behave
to
a
man
of
high
birth
the
footmen
were
again
deterred
from
approaching
by
a
glance
from
the
intimidating
eyes
of
thaddeus
who
turning
with
stern
dignity
to
the
storming
earl
said
you
can
teach
me
nothing
about
high
birth
that
i
do
not
already
know
could
it
be
of
any
independent
benefit
to
a
man
then
had
i
not
received
the
taunts
and
insults
which
you
have
dared
to
cast
upon
me
at
that
moment
cavendish
having
heard
a
bustle
made
his
appearance
amazed
at
the
sight
of
two
strangers
who
from
their
enraged
countenances
and
the
proud
elevation
with
which
thaddeus
was
standing
between
them
he
rightly
judged
to
be
the
earl
and
his
son
he
advanced
towards
his
friend
intending
to
support
him
in
the
attack
which
he
saw
was
menaced
by
the
violent
gestures
of
these
visitors
cavendish
said
thaddeus
speaking
to
him
as
he
approached
your
name
must
be
a
passport
to
the
confidence
of
any
man
i
therefore
shall
gratify
the
husband
of
my
ever
lamented
friend
by
quitting
this
house
but
i
delegate
to
you
the
office
with
which
she
entrusted
me
i
leave
you
in
charge
of
her
sacred
remains
and
of
the
jewels
which
you
will
find
in
her
apartment
she
desired
that
half
of
them
might
be
given
with
her
blessing
to
her
daughter
and
the
other
half
with
her
pardon
to
her
son
tell
me
cavendish
cried
the
earl
as
thaddeus
was
passing
him
to
leave
the
room
who
is
that
insolent
fellow
by
heaven
he
shall
smart
for
this
ay
that
he
shall
rejoined
lord
harwold
if
i
have
any
interest
with
the
cavendish
was
preparing
to
speak
when
thaddeus
turning
round
at
this
last
threat
of
the
viscount
said
if
i
did
not
know
myself
to
be
above
lord
harwold
power
perhaps
he
might
provoke
me
to
treat
him
according
to
his
deserts
but
i
abjure
resentment
while
i
pity
his
delusions
for
you
my
lord
added
he
addressing
the
earl
with
a
less
calm
countenance
there
is
an
angel
in
heaven
who
pleads
against
the
insults
you
have
uninquiringly
and
unjustly
heaped
upon
an
innocent
man
thaddeus
disappeared
from
the
apartment
while
uttering
the
last
word
hastening
from
the
house
and
park
he
stopped
near
the
brow
of
the
hill
at
the
porch
of
his
lately
peaceful
little
hotel
the
landlady
was
a
sister
of
john
jacobs
the
faithful
servant
of
his
lamented
friend
and
who
was
then
watching
the
door
of
the
neglected
chamber
in
which
the
sacred
remains
of
his
dear
mistress
lay
as
he
would
have
guarded
her
life
had
the
foes
who
had
now
destroyed
it
been
still
menacing
its
flickering
flame
the
worthy
couple
were
also
attached
to
that
benevolent
lady
and
with
sad
looks
but
respectful
welcoming
they
saw
constantine
their
humble
home
and
assured
him
of
its
retirement
as
long
as
he
might
wish
to
abide
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
abbey
any
prospect
of
repose
promised
elysium
to
him
and
with
harassed
and
torn
nerves
he
took
possession
of
his
apartment
which
looked
down
the
road
that
led
from
the
old
monastic
structure
to
the
town
of
grantham
the
rapidity
of
the
recent
events
bewildered
his
senses
like
the
illusions
of
a
dream
he
had
seen
his
father
his
sister
his
brother
and
most
probably
he
had
parted
from
them
forever
at
least
he
hoped
he
should
never
again
be
tortured
with
the
sight
of
lord
tinemouth
or
his
son
how
thought
he
whilst
walking
up
and
down
his
solitary
parlor
could
the
noble
nature
of
my
mother
love
such
a
man
and
how
could
he
have
held
so
long
an
empire
over
the
pure
heart
he
has
just
now
broken
he
could
nowhere
discern
in
the
bloated
visage
and
rageful
gestures
of
the
earl
any
of
that
beauty
of
countenance
or
grace
of
manners
which
had
alike
charmed
therese
sobieski
and
the
tender
acleliza
like
those
hideous
chasms
which
are
dug
deep
in
the
land
by
the
impetuous
sweep
of
a
torrent
the
course
of
violent
passions
leaves
vast
and
irreparable
traces
on
the
features
and
in
the
soul
so
it
was
with
lord
tinemouth
how
legibly
does
vice
or
virtue
ejaculated
thaddeus
write
itself
on
the
human
face
the
earl
might
once
have
been
fine
but
the
lineaments
of
selfishness
and
sin
have
degraded
every
part
of
him
mysterious
providence
can
he
be
my
father
can
it
be
his
blood
that
is
now
running
in
my
veins
can
it
be
his
blood
that
rises
at
this
moment
with
detestation
against
him
before
the
sun
set
sobieski
was
aroused
from
these
painful
soliloquies
by
still
more
painful
feelings
he
saw
from
his
window
a
hearse
driving
at
full
speed
up
the
road
that
ascended
to
the
abbey
and
presently
return
at
a
slower
pace
followed
by
a
single
black
coach
inhuman
men
exclaimed
he
while
pursuing
with
his
eyes
the
tips
of
the
sable
plumes
as
the
meagre
cavalcade
of
mourners
wound
down
the
hill
could
you
not
allow
this
poor
corse
a
little
rest
must
her
persecution
be
extended
to
the
grave
must
her
cold
relics
be
insulted
be
hurried
to
the
tomb
without
reverence
without
decency
the
filial
heart
that
uttered
this
thought
also
of
his
own
injured
mother
and
shrunk
with
horror
at
this
climax
of
the
barbarity
cavendish
entered
with
a
flushed
countenance
he
spoke
indignantly
of
the
act
he
still
saw
from
the
window
which
he
denounced
as
a
sacrilege
against
the
dead
not
hours
since
cried
he
she
expired
and
she
is
hurried
into
the
cold
bosom
of
the
earth
like
a
criminal
or
a
creature
whose
ashes
a
moment
above
ground
might
spread
a
pestilence
oh
how
can
that
sweet
victim
lady
albin
share
such
peccant
blood
thaddeus
whose
soul
had
just
writhed
under
a
similar
question
with
regard
to
himself
could
little
bear
the
repetition
and
interrupted
the
good
physician
by
tenderly
inquiring
how
she
had
borne
that
so
abrupt
removal
of
her
mother
remains
with
mute
anguish
returned
cavendish
in
a
responding
calmer
voice
of
pity
and
though
i
had
warned
her
father
that
the
shock
of
so
suddenly
tearing
his
daughter
from
such
beloved
relics
might
peril
her
own
life
he
continued
obdarate
and
putting
her
into
his
travelling
chariot
in
a
state
of
insensibility
along
with
her
maid
in
a
few
minutes
afterwards
i
saw
him
set
off
in
a
hired
accompanied
by
his
detestable
son
loaded
with
more
than
one
curse
muttered
by
the
honest
rustics
only
servants
followed
in
that
mourning
coach
in
the
midst
of
this
depressing
conversation
a
courier
arrived
from
stamford
to
cavendish
recalling
him
immediately
to
return
thither
the
invalid
there
having
sustained
an
alarming
relapse
the
good
doctor
sincerely
reluctant
to
quit
thaddeus
whom
he
still
knew
by
no
other
name
than
constantine
ordered
the
to
the
hotel
door
when
it
was
announced
he
shook
hands
with
the
now
lonely
survivor
of
his
departed
friend
in
this
stranger
land
requested
that
he
might
hear
from
him
before
he
left
that
part
of
the
country
for
london
again
and
bidding
him
many
cordial
adieus
continued
to
look
out
of
the
back
window
of
the
carriage
until
the
faint
light
of
the
moon
and
the
receding
glimmer
of
the
village
candles
finally
hid
the
little
spot
that
yet
contained
this
young
and
exile
from
his
lingering
eyes
chapter
xliii
the
old
village
hotel
for
the
first
time
during
many
nights
thaddeus
slept
soundly
but
his
dreams
were
disturbed
and
he
awoke
from
them
at
an
early
hour
unrefreshed
and
in
much
fever
the
simple
breakfast
which
his
attentive
host
and
hostess
set
before
him
was
scarcely
touched
their
dinner
met
with
the
same
fate
he
was
ill
and
possessed
neither
appetite
nor
spirits
to
eat
the
good
people
being
too
civil
to
intrude
upon
him
he
sat
alone
in
his
window
from
eight
at
which
hour
he
had
arisen
until
the
cawing
of
the
rooks
as
they
returned
to
the
reminded
him
of
the
approach
of
evening
he
was
uneasy
at
the
absence
of
somerset
not
so
much
on
his
own
account
as
on
that
of
sir
robert
whose
increased
danger
might
have
occasioned
this
delay
however
he
hoped
otherwise
longing
earnestly
for
a
temporary
sanctuary
under
his
friend
paternal
roof
in
the
quiet
of
its
peace
and
virtues
he
trusted
that
the
sympathy
of
pembroke
the
only
confidant
of
his
past
sorrows
would
tend
to
heal
his
recent
wounds
though
the
nature
of
the
most
galling
he
felt
must
ever
remain
unrevealed
even
to
him
and
so
fit
him
should
it
be
required
to
yet
further
brave
the
buffets
of
an
adverse
fate
nor
was
miss
beaufort
forgotten
if
ever
one
idea
more
than
another
sweetened
the
bitterness
of
his
reflections
it
was
the
remembrance
of
mary
beaufort
whenever
her
image
rose
before
him
whether
he
were
standing
in
the
lonely
clay
with
folded
arms
in
vacant
gaze
on
the
valley
beneath
or
when
lying
on
his
watchful
pillow
he
opened
his
aching
eyes
to
the
morning
as
her
angel
figure
presented
itself
to
his
mind
he
did
indeed
sigh
but
it
was
a
sigh
laden
with
balm
it
did
not
tear
his
breast
like
those
which
had
been
wrung
from
him
by
the
hard
hand
of
calamity
and
insult
it
was
the
soft
breath
of
a
hallowed
love
which
makes
man
dream
of
heaven
while
he
feels
sinking
to
an
early
grave
thaddeus
felt
it
delightful
to
recollect
how
she
had
looked
on
him
that
day
in
hyde
park
when
she
bade
him
take
care
of
his
own
life
while
so
devoted
to
that
of
his
dying
friend
and
how
she
blessed
him
in
his
task
with
a
voice
of
tenderness
so
startlingly
sacred
to
his
soul
in
its
accents
that
in
remembering
her
words
now
when
so
near
the
moment
of
his
again
seeing
and
hearing
her
his
soul
expanded
towards
her
agitated
indeed
but
soothed
and
comforted
sweet
mary
murmured
he
i
shall
behold
thee
once
more
i
shall
again
revive
under
thy
kind
smile
oh
it
is
happiness
to
know
that
i
owe
my
liberty
to
thee
though
i
may
not
dare
to
tell
thee
so
yet
my
swelling
heart
may
cherish
the
clear
consciousness
and
bereaved
though
i
am
of
all
i
formerly
loved
be
indeed
blessed
while
on
earth
with
the
privilege
of
loving
thee
even
in
silence
and
forever
alas
alas
a
man
without
kindred
or
a
country
dare
not
even
wish
thee
to
be
his
a
sigh
from
the
depths
of
his
soul
closed
this
soliloquy
the
sight
of
pembroke
riding
through
the
field
towards
the
little
inn
recalled
the
thoughts
of
sobieski
to
that
dear
friend
alone
he
went
out
to
meet
him
somerset
saw
him
and
putting
his
horse
to
a
brisk
canter
was
at
his
side
in
a
few
minutes
thaddeus
asked
anxiously
about
the
baronet
health
pembroke
answered
with
an
incoherency
devoid
of
all
meaning
thaddeus
looked
at
him
with
surprise
but
from
increased
anxiety
forbore
to
repeat
the
question
they
walked
towards
the
inn
still
pembroke
did
not
appear
to
recover
himself
and
his
evident
absence
of
mind
and
the
wild
rambling
of
his
eyes
were
so
striking
that
thaddeus
could
have
no
doubt
of
some
dreadful
accident
as
soon
as
they
had
entered
the
little
parlor
his
friend
cast
himself
into
a
chair
and
throwing
off
his
hat
wiped
away
the
perspiration
which
though
a
cold
october
evening
was
streaming
down
his
forehead
thaddeus
endured
a
suspense
which
was
almost
insupportable
what
is
the
direful
matter
dear
pembroke
is
any
we
honor
and
love
ill
unto
death
his
pale
face
showed
that
he
apprehended
it
and
he
thought
it
might
be
mary
no
no
returned
pembroke
everybody
is
well
excepting
myself
and
my
father
who
i
verily
believe
has
lost
his
senses
at
any
rate
he
will
drive
me
mad
the
manner
in
which
this
reply
was
uttered
astonished
thaddeus
so
much
that
he
could
only
gaze
with
wonder
on
the
convulsed
feature
of
his
friend
pembroke
observed
his
amazement
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
arm
said
my
dear
dear
sobieski
what
do
i
not
owe
to
you
good
heaven
how
humbled
am
i
in
your
sight
but
there
is
a
power
above
who
knows
how
intimately
you
are
woven
with
every
artery
of
this
heart
i
believe
it
my
kind
pembroke
cried
thaddeus
yet
more
alarmed
than
before
tell
me
what
it
is
that
distresses
you
if
my
counsel
or
my
sympathy
can
offer
anything
to
comfort
or
assist
you
you
know
i
am
your
own
pembroke
burst
into
tears
and
covering
his
streaming
eyes
with
his
handkerchief
exclaimed
i
am
indeed
distressed
distressed
even
beyond
your
comfort
oh
how
can
i
speak
it
you
will
despise
my
father
you
will
spurn
me
impossible
cried
thaddeus
with
energy
though
his
flushed
cheek
and
fainting
heart
immediately
declared
that
he
had
anticipated
what
he
must
hear
i
see
cried
pembroke
regarding
the
altered
features
of
his
friend
with
a
glance
of
agony
i
see
that
you
think
it
is
possible
that
my
father
can
sink
me
below
my
own
contempt
the
benumbing
touch
of
ingratitude
ran
through
the
veins
of
thaddeus
his
frame
was
chilled
was
petrified
but
his
just
affection
and
calmed
countenance
proclaimed
how
true
a
judgment
he
had
passed
on
the
whole
he
took
the
burning
hand
of
somerset
in
his
own
and
with
a
steady
and
consoling
voice
said
assure
yourself
dear
pembroke
whatever
be
the
commands
of
your
father
i
shall
adhere
to
them
i
can
not
understand
by
these
generous
emotions
that
he
objects
to
receive
me
as
your
friend
perhaps
added
he
a
flash
of
suspicion
gleaming
through
his
mind
perhaps
miss
beaufort
may
have
perceived
the
devotedness
of
my
heart
and
disdaining
my
hush
for
heaven
sake
cried
pembroke
starting
from
his
chair
do
not
implicate
my
poor
cousin
do
not
add
to
her
disappointment
the
misery
that
you
suspect
her
no
thaddeus
continued
he
in
a
calmer
tone
mary
beaufort
loves
you
she
confessed
it
in
an
agony
of
grief
on
my
bosom
just
before
i
came
away
and
only
through
her
i
dare
ever
expect
to
meet
forgiveness
from
in
spite
of
my
father
you
may
marry
her
she
has
no
curse
to
dread
she
need
not
sacrifice
all
that
is
most
precious
in
her
sight
to
the
obstinate
caprice
of
criminal
resentment
a
curse
reiterated
thaddeus
how
is
this
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
such
hatred
from
your
father
oh
nothing
cried
pembroke
nothing
my
father
never
saw
you
my
father
thanks
you
for
all
that
you
have
done
for
me
but
it
is
your
country
that
he
hates
some
polander
years
back
injured
him
and
my
father
took
a
fatal
oath
against
the
whole
nation
he
declares
that
he
can
not
he
will
not
break
it
were
he
by
so
doing
to
save
his
own
life
or
even
mine
for
heaven
forgive
me
i
was
this
morning
wrought
up
to
such
frenzy
that
i
threatened
to
destroy
myself
rather
than
sacrifice
my
gratitude
and
honor
to
his
cruel
commands
nay
to
convince
you
that
his
is
no
personal
enmity
to
yourself
he
ordered
me
to
give
you
writings
which
will
put
you
in
possession
of
an
independence
forever
i
have
them
with
me
all
the
pride
of
his
princely
house
rose
at
once
in
the
breast
of
thaddeus
though
full
of
indignation
at
this
insult
of
sir
robert
he
regarded
the
averted
face
of
his
friend
with
compassion
whilst
in
a
firm
voice
he
rejected
the
degrading
compromise
tell
your
father
added
he
addressing
pembroke
in
a
tone
which
even
his
affection
could
not
soften
from
a
command
that
my
absence
is
not
to
be
bought
with
money
nor
my
friendship
so
rewarded
pembroke
covered
his
burning
face
with
his
hands
this
sight
at
once
brought
down
the
haughty
spirit
of
sobieski
who
continued
in
gentler
accents
whatever
be
the
sentiments
of
sir
robert
somerset
they
shall
meet
with
clue
attention
from
me
he
is
your
father
therefore
i
respect
him
but
he
has
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
oblige
me
i
can
not
accept
his
bounty
though
your
heart
my
dearest
pembroke
is
above
all
price
yet
i
will
make
it
a
sacrifice
to
your
duty
and
by
so
doing
put
the
last
seal
on
my
misfortunes
was
the
meaning
of
the
heavy
sigh
which
accompanied
his
last
words
pembroke
traversed
the
room
in
an
agony
merciful
providence
cried
he
wringing
his
clasped
hands
direct
me
oh
thaddeus
if
you
could
read
my
tortured
heart
you
would
pity
me
you
would
see
that
this
affair
is
tearing
my
soul
from
my
body
what
am
i
to
do
i
can
not
i
will
not
part
with
you
forever
thaddeus
with
a
calm
sadness
drew
him
to
a
seat
be
satisfied
said
he
that
i
am
convinced
of
your
affection
whatever
may
happen
this
assurance
will
be
sufficient
to
give
me
comfort
therefore
by
that
affection
i
entreat
you
dear
pembroke
not
to
bring
regret
to
me
and
reproach
on
yourself
by
disobeying
in
any
way
the
will
of
your
father
in
this
matter
if
we
separate
for
life
remember
my
beloved
friend
that
the
span
of
our
existence
here
is
short
we
shall
meet
again
in
a
happier
world
perhaps
more
blest
for
having
immolated
our
wishes
to
hard
duty
in
this
cease
sobieski
cease
cried
pembroke
i
can
draw
no
consolation
from
this
reasoning
it
is
not
duty
to
obey
a
hatred
little
short
of
distraction
and
if
we
now
separate
i
feel
that
i
never
shall
know
peace
again
good
heaven
what
comfort
can
i
find
when
you
are
exposed
to
all
the
indignities
which
the
world
levels
against
the
unfortunate
can
i
indulge
in
the
luxuries
of
my
father
house
when
i
know
that
you
have
neither
a
home
nor
subsistence
no
thaddeus
i
am
not
such
a
villain
i
will
not
give
you
up
though
my
father
should
load
me
with
curses
i
trust
there
is
a
just
power
above
who
would
avert
them
perceiving
that
argument
would
not
only
be
fruitless
but
might
probably
incense
his
friend
irritated
nature
to
the
commission
of
some
rash
action
thaddeus
pretended
to
overlook
the
frantic
gesture
and
voice
which
terminated
this
speech
and
assuming
a
serene
air
replied
let
this
be
the
subject
of
a
future
conversation
at
present
i
must
conjure
you
by
the
happiness
of
us
both
to
return
to
the
castle
you
know
my
message
to
sir
robert
present
my
respects
to
your
aunt
and
added
he
after
an
agitated
pause
assure
miss
beaufort
that
whilst
i
have
life
her
goodness
her
sometimes
remembrance
will
be
pembroke
interrupted
him
why
these
messages
dear
thaddeus
do
not
suppose
though
i
fulfil
my
father
orders
to
return
to
somerset
night
that
it
is
our
separation
gracious
heaven
is
it
so
easy
to
part
forever
not
forever
oh
no
replied
thaddeus
grasping
his
hand
we
shall
see
each
other
again
only
meanwhile
repeat
those
alas
inadequate
messages
to
your
aunt
and
cousin
go
my
dear
pembroke
to
your
father
and
may
the
lord
of
heaven
bless
you
the
last
words
were
spoken
in
almost
a
stifled
voice
as
he
opened
his
arms
and
strained
his
friend
to
his
breast
i
shall
see
you
cried
pembroke
on
no
other
condition
will
i
leave
you
now
thaddeus
made
no
further
answer
to
this
demand
which
he
determined
should
never
be
granted
than
a
second
embrace
pembroke
went
out
of
the
room
to
order
his
horse
then
returning
he
stood
at
the
door
and
holding
out
his
hand
to
the
count
repeated
farewell
till
morrow
thaddeus
pressed
it
warmly
and
he
disappeared
the
outward
gate
closed
after
his
friend
but
sobieski
remained
on
the
seat
into
which
he
had
thrown
himself
he
did
not
venture
to
move
lest
he
should
by
chance
catch
a
second
glance
of
pembroke
from
the
window
now
that
he
was
gone
he
acknowledged
the
full
worth
of
what
he
had
relinquished
he
had
resigned
a
man
who
loved
him
one
who
had
known
and
revered
his
grandfather
and
his
mother
the
only
one
with
whom
he
could
have
discoursed
of
their
virtues
he
had
severed
the
link
which
had
united
his
present
state
with
his
former
fortunes
and
throwing
his
arms
along
a
table
that
stood
near
him
he
leaned
his
aching
head
upon
them
and
in
idea
followed
with
a
bleeding
heart
the
progress
and
reception
of
his
friend
at
the
castle
the
racking
misery
which
tortured
the
mind
of
somerset
was
not
borne
with
equal
resignation
conscious
of
his
having
inflicted
fresh
wounds
on
the
breast
of
his
truest
friend
his
spirits
were
so
ill
adapted
to
any
conversation
that
he
was
pleased
rather
than
disappointed
when
he
found
the
at
the
castle
quite
vacant
and
only
one
cover
on
the
table
awaiting
his
arrival
he
asked
a
few
questions
of
the
servants
who
informed
him
that
it
was
past
twelve
and
that
sir
robert
who
had
become
worse
had
retired
to
bed
early
in
the
evening
and
where
are
my
aunt
and
cousin
demanded
pembroke
one
of
the
men
replied
that
in
consequence
of
miss
beaufort
having
been
taken
suddenly
indisposed
both
the
ladies
left
the
saloon
before
eleven
pembroke
readily
guessed
the
cause
of
her
disorder
he
too
truly
ascribed
it
to
mary
anxiety
respecting
the
reception
which
the
noble
sobieski
would
give
to
his
disgraceful
proposition
sighing
bitterly
he
said
no
more
but
went
to
his
chamber
the
restless
state
of
his
mind
awoke
somerset
by
times
anxious
for
the
success
of
an
application
which
he
intended
to
make
to
his
beloved
cousin
whose
pure
and
virgin
heart
he
believed
did
indeed
here
sympathize
with
his
own
he
traversed
the
terrace
for
an
hour
before
he
was
summoned
to
breakfast
the
baronet
continuing
too
ill
to
leave
his
room
the
ladies
only
were
in
the
parlor
when
he
entered
miss
dorothy
who
had
learned
the
particulars
of
the
late
events
from
her
niece
longed
to
ask
pembroke
how
his
noble
friend
would
act
on
her
brother
so
strange
and
lamentable
conduct
conduct
so
unlike
himself
in
any
other
circumstance
of
gratitude
in
his
life
but
every
time
she
moved
her
lips
to
inquire
her
nephew
inflamed
eyes
and
wan
countenance
made
her
fear
to
venture
on
the
subject
mary
sat
in
mute
dejection
watching
the
agitation
of
his
features
and
when
he
rose
to
quit
the
room
still
in
silence
she
looked
wistfully
towards
him
pembroke
turned
at
the
same
moment
and
holding
out
his
hand
to
her
said
come
mary
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
will
you
walk
with
me
on
the
terrace
with
a
beating
heart
miss
beaufort
took
his
arm
and
proceeded
without
a
word
until
they
ascended
the
stone
steps
and
reached
the
terrace
a
mutual
sigh
was
the
first
opening
to
a
conversation
on
which
the
souls
of
both
hung
pembroke
was
the
first
who
spoke
my
dear
mary
cried
he
you
are
now
my
sole
dependence
from
what
i
told
you
yesterday
of
my
father
inflexibility
we
can
have
no
hope
of
his
relenting
indeed
after
what
has
passed
i
could
not
flatter
myself
that
thaddeus
sobieski
would
now
submit
to
any
obligation
at
his
hands
already
he
has
refused
with
all
the
indignation
i
expected
sir
robert
offer
of
an
annuity
my
dear
cousin
how
can
i
exist
and
yet
witness
this
my
best
friend
in
distress
and
living
without
the
succor
of
my
friendship
heaven
knows
this
can
not
be
the
case
for
i
would
sooner
perish
than
venture
to
insult
the
man
my
father
has
treated
so
ill
with
any
pecuniary
offers
from
me
therefore
dear
girl
it
is
on
you
alone
that
i
depend
with
his
whole
soul
as
our
marriage
service
says
thaddeus
you
you
love
him
in
a
few
days
you
will
become
of
age
you
will
be
your
own
mistress
marry
him
my
beloved
cousin
cried
pembroke
pressing
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
relieve
my
heart
from
a
load
of
misery
be
generous
my
sweet
mary
added
he
supporting
her
now
trembling
frame
against
his
breast
act
up
to
your
noble
nature
and
offer
him
by
me
that
hand
which
his
calamities
and
disinterestedness
preclude
him
from
wooing
himself
miss
beaufort
hardly
able
to
articulate
replied
i
would
give
him
all
that
i
possess
could
it
purchase
him
one
tranquil
hour
i
would
serve
him
forever
could
i
do
it
and
be
unknown
but
o
do
not
hesitate
do
not
doubt
interrupted
pembroke
to
serve
your
friends
i
know
you
are
capable
of
the
most
extraordinary
exertions
i
know
there
is
nothing
within
the
range
of
possibility
that
your
generous
disposition
would
not
attempt
then
my
beloved
mary
dare
to
be
what
you
are
by
having
the
magnanimity
to
act
as
you
know
you
ought
by
offering
your
hand
to
him
show
the
noble
sobieski
that
you
really
deserve
the
devotion
of
a
hero
heart
deserves
to
be
his
consolation
who
in
losing
his
mother
lost
an
angel
like
yourself
dear
pembroke
replied
miss
beaufort
wiping
the
gliding
tears
from
her
burning
cheek
after
the
confession
which
you
drew
from
me
yesterday
i
will
not
deny
that
to
be
this
to
your
friend
would
render
me
the
happiest
of
created
beings
but
i
can
not
believe
what
your
sanguine
affection
tells
me
i
can
not
suppose
situated
as
i
was
at
lady
dundas
surrounded
by
frivolous
and
contemptible
society
that
he
could
discover
anything
in
me
to
warrant
such
a
vanity
every
way
embarrassed
as
i
was
disliking
my
companions
afraid
of
my
own
interest
in
him
a
veil
was
drawn
over
my
mind
through
which
he
could
neither
judge
of
my
good
nor
bad
qualities
how
then
can
i
flatter
myself
or
do
the
count
sobieski
so
great
an
injury
as
to
imagine
that
he
could
conceive
any
preference
for
so
insignificant
a
being
as
i
must
have
appeared
it
was
some
time
before
pembroke
could
shake
this
prepossession
of
a
sincere
humility
from
miss
beaufort
mind
but
after
having
set
in
every
possible
light
the
terms
with
which
his
friend
had
spoken
of
her
he
at
length
convinced
her
of
what
her
heart
so
earnestly
wished
to
believe
that
the
love
of
sobieski
was
indeed
hers
somerset
next
achievement
was
to
overcome
her
scruples
against
sanctioning
him
with
the
commission
he
was
bent
on
communicating
to
thaddeus
but
from
the
continual
recurrence
of
her
apprehensions
that
the
warm
affection
of
her
cousin
had
too
highly
colored
the
first
part
of
his
representation
this
latter
task
was
not
more
easy
to
accomplish
than
the
former
in
vain
she
remonstrated
in
vain
she
doubted
in
vain
demurred
pembroke
would
not
be
denied
he
saw
her
heart
was
with
him
and
when
with
faltering
lips
she
assented
to
the
permission
which
he
almost
extorted
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
implored
him
by
all
he
loved
and
honored
to
be
careful
of
her
peace
to
remember
that
she
put
into
his
charge
all
that
was
most
precious
to
woman
the
modesty
of
her
sex
and
her
own
delighted
at
this
consent
notwithstanding
he
received
it
through
the
medium
of
many
tears
he
fondly
and
gratefully
pressed
her
to
his
bosom
uttering
his
own
soul
fervent
conviction
of
a
future
domestic
happiness
to
them
all
having
stood
till
he
saw
her
the
house
from
a
door
on
the
terrace
he
mounted
his
horse
and
set
off
on
the
spur
towards
harrow
by
hill
chapter
xliv
letters
of
farewell
when
thaddeus
recovered
from
the
reverie
into
which
he
fell
on
the
departure
of
somerset
he
considered
how
he
might
remove
out
of
a
country
in
which
he
had
only
met
with
and
occasioned
distress
the
horrid
price
that
pembroke
father
had
set
on
the
continuance
of
his
son
friendship
with
a
powerless
exile
was
his
curse
whatever
might
have
been
the
injury
any
individual
of
now
annihilated
poland
could
in
its
palmy
days
of
independence
and
sometimes
pride
inflict
on
this
implacable
englishman
of
a
nature
that
appeared
to
have
blinded
him
to
even
human
feeling
thaddeus
felt
so
true
an
indignation
against
such
cruel
injustice
and
so
much
of
a
contrary
sentiment
towards
the
noble
son
of
this
hard
parent
that
he
determined
to
at
once
relieve
the
warring
mind
of
pembroke
of
any
further
conflict
on
his
account
by
immediately
quitting
england
averse
to
a
second
interview
with
a
friend
so
justly
beloved
which
could
only
produce
them
new
pangs
he
resolved
on
instant
preparations
that
another
morn
should
not
rise
upon
him
in
the
neighborhood
of
somerset
castle
taking
up
a
pen
with
all
the
renewed
loneliness
of
his
fate
brooding
on
his
heart
he
wrote
two
letters
one
he
addressed
to
somerset
bidding
him
that
farewell
which
he
confessed
he
could
never
take
as
he
wrote
his
hand
trembled
his
bosom
swelled
and
he
hastily
shut
his
eyelids
to
withhold
his
tears
from
showing
themselves
on
the
paper
his
emotion
his
grief
were
driven
back
were
concealed
but
the
tenderness
of
his
soul
flowed
over
the
letter
he
forgave
pembroke
father
for
pembroke
sake
and
in
spite
of
their
personal
disunion
he
vowed
that
no
earthly
power
should
restrain
his
love
from
following
the
steps
of
his
friend
even
into
the
regions
of
eternity
he
closed
his
melancholy
epistle
with
informing
somerset
that
as
he
should
quit
not
only
england
directly
but
europe
any
search
after
him
which
his
generous
nature
might
dictate
would
be
in
vain
though
thaddeus
sobieski
would
have
disdained
a
life
of
dependence
on
the
greatest
potentate
of
the
world
though
he
rejected
with
the
same
sincerity
a
similar
proposal
from
his
friend
and
despised
the
degrading
offer
of
sir
robert
yet
he
did
not
disparage
his
dignity
not
infringe
on
the
disinterested
nature
of
friendship
when
he
retained
the
money
which
pembroke
had
conveyed
to
him
in
prison
thaddeus
never
acted
but
from
principle
his
honorable
and
penetrating
mind
knew
exactly
at
what
point
to
draw
the
tender
thread
of
delicacy
the
cord
of
independence
but
pride
and
independence
were
with
him
distinct
terms
receiving
assistance
from
a
friend
and
leaning
on
him
wholly
for
support
have
different
meanings
he
accepted
the
first
with
gratitude
he
would
have
thought
it
impossible
to
live
and
endure
the
last
indeed
thaddeus
would
have
considered
himself
unworthy
to
confer
a
benefit
if
he
had
not
known
how
to
receive
one
but
had
not
pembroke
told
him
the
whole
gift
was
mary
beaufort
and
what
were
his
emotions
then
they
were
full
of
an
ineffable
sense
of
happiness
inexplicable
to
himself
mary
beaufort
was
the
donor
and
it
was
bliss
to
have
it
so
and
to
know
it
was
so
with
these
impressions
again
throbbing
at
his
heart
he
began
a
short
letter
to
her
which
he
felt
must
crush
that
heart
forever
to
miss
beaufort
my
faculties
lose
their
power
when
i
take
up
my
pen
to
address
for
the
first
and
the
last
time
miss
beaufort
i
hardly
know
what
i
would
say
what
i
ought
to
say
i
dare
not
venture
to
write
all
that
i
feel
but
have
you
not
been
my
benefactress
did
you
not
assert
my
character
and
give
me
liberty
when
i
was
calumniated
and
in
distress
did
you
not
ward
from
me
the
scorn
of
unpitying
folly
did
you
not
console
me
with
your
own
compassion
you
have
done
all
this
and
surely
you
will
not
despise
the
gratitude
of
a
heart
which
you
have
condescended
to
sooth
and
to
comfort
at
least
i
can
not
leave
england
forever
without
imploring
blessings
on
the
head
of
miss
beaufort
without
thanking
her
on
my
knees
on
which
i
am
writing
for
that
gracious
and
benign
spirit
which
discovered
a
breaking
heart
under
the
mask
of
serenity
which
penetrated
through
the
garb
of
poverty
and
dependence
and
saw
that
the
condemned
constantine
was
not
what
he
seemed
your
smiles
miss
beaufort
your
voice
speaking
commiseration
were
my
sweetest
consolations
during
those
heavy
months
of
bitterness
which
i
endured
at
dundas
house
i
contemplated
you
as
a
pitying
angel
sent
to
reconcile
me
to
a
life
which
had
already
become
a
burden
these
are
the
benefits
which
miss
beaufort
has
bestowed
on
a
friendless
exile
these
are
the
benefits
which
she
has
bestowed
on
me
and
they
are
written
on
my
soul
not
until
i
go
down
into
the
grave
can
they
be
forgotten
ah
not
even
then
for
when
i
rise
again
i
shall
find
them
still
registered
there
farewell
most
respected
most
dear
most
honored
my
passing
soul
seems
in
those
words
o
may
the
father
of
heaven
bless
with
his
almighty
care
her
whose
name
will
ever
be
the
first
and
the
last
in
the
prayer
of
the
far
distant
thaddeus
constantine
sobieski
harrowby
village
midnight
when
he
had
finished
this
epistle
with
a
tremulous
hand
he
consigned
it
to
the
same
cover
that
contained
his
letter
to
somerset
then
writing
a
few
lines
to
the
worthy
master
of
the
inn
the
law
of
the
faithful
servant
of
his
late
lamented
maternal
friend
saying
that
a
sudden
occasion
had
required
his
immediate
departure
at
that
untimely
hour
he
enclosed
a
liberal
compensation
in
gold
for
the
attentive
services
of
both
the
honest
man
and
his
wife
having
sealed
each
packet
he
disposed
them
so
on
the
table
that
they
might
be
the
first
things
seen
on
entering
the
room
he
had
fixed
on
deep
night
as
the
securest
time
for
commencing
unobserved
his
pedestrian
tour
the
moon
was
now
full
and
would
be
a
sufficient
guide
he
thought
on
his
solitary
way
he
had
determined
to
walk
to
london
by
the
least
public
paths
meaning
to
see
kind
robson
and
bid
her
a
grateful
farewell
before
he
should
embark
probably
never
to
return
for
america
he
had
prepared
his
slender
baggage
before
he
sat
down
to
write
the
two
letters
which
had
cost
him
so
many
pangs
compressed
within
a
light
black
leather
he
fastened
it
over
his
shoulders
by
its
buckled
straps
in
the
manner
of
a
soldier
knapsack
he
then
put
the
which
contained
his
world
wealth
now
to
be
carefully
husbanded
into
a
concealed
pocket
in
the
breast
of
his
waistcoat
feeling
while
he
pressed
it
down
upon
his
heart
that
his
mother
locket
and
miss
beaufort
chain
kept
guard
over
it
ah
cried
he
as
he
gently
closed
the
low
window
by
which
he
leaped
into
the
garden
england
i
leave
thee
forever
and
within
thee
all
that
on
this
earth
had
been
left
to
me
to
love
driven
from
thee
nay
driven
as
if
i
were
another
cain
from
the
face
of
every
spot
of
earth
that
ever
had
been
or
would
be
dear
to
me
oh
woe
to
them
who
began
the
course
and
thou
austria
ungrateful
leader
in
the
destruction
of
the
country
which
more
than
once
was
thy
preserver
could
there
be
any
marvel
that
the
last
of
the
sobieskis
should
perish
with
her
what
accumulated
sins
must
rest
on
thy
head
thou
seducer
of
other
nations
into
the
spoliation
and
dismemberment
of
the
bulwark
of
christendom
assuredly
every
hasty
sigh
that
rebels
in
the
breasts
of
poland
outcast
sons
against
the
mystery
of
her
doom
will
plead
against
thee
at
the
of
heaven
he
went
on
at
a
rapid
pace
through
several
fields
his
heart
and
soul
full
of
those
remembrances
and
the
direful
echoes
to
them
he
had
met
in
england
stopping
a
moment
at
the
of
the
harrowby
domains
the
property
of
a
disgraceful
owner
of
a
name
that
might
have
been
his
had
not
his
nobler
mother
preserved
to
him
that
of
sobieski
he
stretched
out
his
arms
to
the
heavens
over
which
a
bleak
wind
was
suddenly
collecting
dark
and
spreading
clouds
and
exclaimed
in
earnest
supplication
oh
righteous
power
of
mercy
in
thy
chastening
grant
me
fortitude
to
bear
with
resignation
to
thy
will
the
miseries
i
may
yet
have
to
encounter
ah
added
he
his
heart
melting
as
the
images
presented
themselves
even
as
visions
to
his
soul
teach
me
to
forget
what
i
have
been
teach
me
to
forget
that
on
this
dreadful
october
night
twelve
months
ago
i
clasped
the
dying
body
of
my
revered
grandfather
in
these
arms
he
could
not
speak
further
leaning
his
pale
face
against
the
gate
he
remained
for
a
few
minutes
dissolved
in
all
a
son
sorrow
then
recovering
himself
by
a
sudden
start
he
proceeded
with
hurried
steps
through
the
further
extending
meadows
until
they
conducted
him
by
a
short
into
the
high
road
it
was
on
the
of
october
that
the
count
sobieski
commenced
this
lonely
and
melancholy
journey
it
was
the
of
october
in
the
preceding
year
that
he
found
the
veteran
palatine
bleeding
to
death
in
the
midst
of
a
heap
of
slain
the
coincidence
of
his
renewed
banishment
and
present
consequent
mental
sufferings
with
those
of
that
fatal
period
powerfully
affected
him
recalling
in
the
vivid
colors
of
an
actual
existence
scenes
and
griefs
which
the
numerous
successive
events
he
had
passed
through
had
considerably
toned
down
into
shades
but
now
when
memory
by
one
unexpected
stroke
had
once
conjured
up
the
happy
past
of
his
early
life
and
its
as
early
blighting
true
to
her
nature
she
raised
before
his
mind
eye
every
hope
connected
with
it
and
his
present
doom
till
almost
distracted
he
quickened
his
speed
he
then
slackened
it
he
quickened
it
again
but
nothing
could
rid
him
of
those
successive
images
which
seem
to
glide
around
him
like
mournful
apparitions
of
the
dead
when
the
dawn
broke
and
the
sun
rose
he
found
himself
advanced
several
miles
on
the
south
side
of
ponton
hill
the
spiry
aisles
of
harrowby
abbey
were
discernible
through
the
mist
and
the
towers
of
somerset
castle
from
their
height
and
situation
were
as
distinctly
seen
as
if
he
had
been
at
their
base
neither
of
these
objects
were
calculated
to
raise
the
spirits
of
thaddeus
the
sorrows
of
the
countess
whose
eyes
he
so
recently
had
closed
and
the
treatment
which
he
afterwards
received
from
the
man
to
whom
he
owed
his
life
were
recollections
which
made
him
turn
from
the
abbey
with
a
renewed
pang
and
fix
his
eyes
on
somerset
he
looked
towards
its
ivied
battlements
with
all
the
regret
and
all
the
tenderness
which
can
overflow
a
human
heart
under
that
roof
he
believed
the
eyes
of
his
almost
indeed
worshipped
mary
were
sealed
in
sleep
and
in
an
instant
his
agitated
soul
addressed
her
as
if
she
had
been
present
farewell
most
lovely
most
beloved
the
conviction
that
it
is
to
ensure
the
peace
of
my
now
only
friend
on
earth
my
faithful
pembroke
that
i
resign
the
hope
of
ever
beholding
thee
again
in
this
life
will
bring
me
one
comfort
at
least
in
my
barren
exile
thus
communing
with
his
troubled
spirit
he
walked
the
whole
day
on
his
way
to
london
totally
absorbed
in
meditation
he
did
not
remark
the
gaze
of
curiosity
which
followed
his
elegant
yet
distressed
figure
as
he
passed
through
the
different
towns
and
villages
musing
on
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
he
neither
felt
hunger
nor
thirst
but
with
a
fixed
eye
and
abstracted
countenance
pursued
his
route
until
night
and
weariness
overtook
him
near
a
far
away
from
any
house
thaddeus
looked
around
and
above
the
sky
was
then
clear
and
glittering
with
stars
the
moon
shining
on
a
branch
of
the
ouse
which
divides
leicestershire
from
northamptonshire
lit
the
green
heath
which
skirted
its
banks
he
wished
not
for
a
more
magnificent
canopy
and
placing
his
bag
under
his
head
he
laid
himself
down
beneath
a
hillock
of
furze
and
slept
till
morning
when
he
awoke
from
a
heavy
sleep
which
fatigue
and
fasting
had
rendered
more
oppressive
than
refreshing
he
found
that
the
splendors
of
the
night
were
succeeded
by
a
heavy
rain
and
that
he
was
wet
through
he
arose
with
stiffness
in
his
limbs
pain
in
his
head
and
a
dimness
over
his
eyes
with
a
sense
of
weakness
which
almost
disabled
him
from
moving
he
readily
judged
that
he
had
caught
cold
and
every
moment
feeling
himself
grow
worse
he
thought
it
necessary
to
seek
some
house
where
he
might
procure
rest
and
assistance
leaning
on
his
closed
umbrella
which
in
his
precarious
circumstances
of
travelling
he
used
in
preference
to
a
stick
and
no
longer
able
to
encumber
himself
with
even
the
light
load
of
his
bag
he
cast
it
amongst
the
brambles
near
him
thinking
from
the
symptoms
he
felt
that
he
might
not
have
many
more
hours
to
endure
the
ills
of
life
he
staggered
a
few
yards
further
no
habitation
appeared
his
eyes
soon
seemed
totally
obscured
and
he
sunk
down
on
a
bank
for
a
minute
he
attempted
to
struggle
with
the
cold
grasp
of
death
which
he
believed
was
fastening
on
his
heart
and
are
my
days
to
be
so
short
are
they
to
end
thus
was
the
voice
of
his
thoughts
for
he
was
speechless
oh
thou
merciful
providence
pardon
my
repining
and
those
who
have
brought
me
to
this
my
only
father
hear
me
these
were
the
last
movements
of
his
soundless
lips
while
his
blood
seemed
freezing
to
insensibility
his
eyelids
were
closed
and
pale
and
without
sign
of
animation
he
lay
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
nigh
which
he
had
dropped
he
remained
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
this
state
before
he
was
observed
at
length
a
gentleman
who
was
passing
along
that
road
on
his
way
to
his
in
the
neighborhood
thought
he
perceived
a
man
lying
amongst
the
high
grass
a
little
onward
on
the
heath
he
stopped
his
carriage
instantly
though
driven
by
four
spirited
horses
and
ordering
one
of
the
outriders
to
alight
bade
him
examine
whether
the
object
in
view
were
living
or
dead
the
servant
obeyed
and
presently
returning
with
an
affrighted
countenance
he
informed
his
master
that
it
was
the
body
of
a
young
man
who
by
his
dress
appeared
to
be
a
gentleman
and
being
quite
senseless
he
supposed
he
had
been
waylaid
and
murdered
by
footpads
the
features
of
the
benevolent
inquirer
immediately
reflected
the
alarm
of
his
informant
ordering
the
chariot
door
to
be
opened
he
took
in
his
hand
a
bottle
of
medicine
which
from
his
own
invalid
states
was
his
carriage
companion
and
stepping
out
hastened
to
the
side
of
the
apparently
lifeless
thaddeus
by
this
time
all
the
servants
were
collected
round
the
spot
the
master
himself
whilst
he
gazed
with
pity
on
the
marble
features
of
the
stranger
observed
with
pleasure
that
he
saw
no
marks
of
violence
supposing
that
the
present
accident
might
have
been
occasioned
by
a
fit
and
thinking
it
possible
to
recall
life
he
desired
that
the
unfortunate
person
might
be
unloosened
and
removing
his
hat
he
contrived
to
pour
some
drops
into
his
mouth
their
warmth
renewed
pulsation
to
the
heart
for
one
of
the
men
who
was
stooping
declared
that
it
beat
under
his
hand
when
the
benevolent
gentleman
was
satisfied
of
the
truth
of
this
report
he
bade
his
servants
place
the
poor
traveller
in
his
carriage
having
only
another
mile
or
two
to
go
he
said
he
hoped
his
charge
might
be
restored
at
the
end
of
so
short
a
drive
whilst
the
postilions
drove
rapidly
towards
the
house
the
cold
face
of
thaddeus
rested
on
the
bosom
of
his
benefactor
who
continued
to
chafe
his
temples
with
eau
de
cologne
until
the
chariot
stopped
before
the
gates
the
men
carried
the
count
into
the
house
and
leaving
him
with
their
master
and
a
medical
man
who
resided
near
other
restoratives
were
applied
which
in
a
short
time
restored
him
to
consciousness
when
he
was
recalled
to
recollection
and
able
to
distinguish
objects
he
saw
that
he
was
supported
by
two
gentlemen
and
in
a
spacious
chamber
gratitude
was
an
active
virtue
in
the
soul
of
thaddeus
at
the
moment
of
his
awakening
from
that
sleep
which
when
it
fell
upon
him
he
believed
would
last
until
time
should
be
lost
in
eternity
he
pressed
the
hands
of
those
who
held
his
own
not
doubting
but
that
they
were
the
good
samaritans
who
had
preserved
him
from
perishing
the
younger
of
the
gentlemen
perceiving
by
the
animated
lustre
which
spread
over
his
patient
eyes
that
he
was
going
to
speak
put
his
hand
on
his
lips
and
said
pardon
me
sir
you
must
be
mute
your
life
at
present
hangs
on
a
thread
the
slightest
exertion
might
snap
it
as
all
you
want
is
rest
and
resuscitation
to
supply
some
great
loss
which
the
vital
powers
have
sustained
i
must
require
that
you
neither
speak
nor
be
spoken
to
until
i
give
permission
meanwhile
be
satisfied
sir
that
you
are
in
the
kindest
hands
this
gentleman
added
he
pointing
to
his
friend
who
bore
the
noble
presence
of
high
rank
saw
you
on
the
heath
and
brought
you
to
his
house
where
you
now
are
thaddeus
bowed
his
head
to
them
both
in
sign
of
obedience
and
gratitude
and
the
elder
with
a
kind
bend
of
his
mild
eyes
in
silence
left
the
room
chapter
xlv
deerhurst
next
morning
when
the
seal
was
taken
off
the
lips
of
the
object
of
their
care
he
expressed
in
grateful
terms
his
deep
sense
of
the
humanity
which
had
actuated
both
the
gentleman
to
take
so
generous
an
interest
in
his
fate
you
owe
no
thanks
to
me
replied
the
one
who
had
enjoined
and
released
him
from
silence
and
who
was
now
alone
with
him
i
am
only
the
agent
of
another
yet
i
do
not
deny
that
in
obeying
the
benevolent
orders
of
sir
robert
somerset
i
have
frequent
opportunities
of
gratifying
my
own
heart
thaddeus
was
so
confounded
at
this
discovery
that
he
could
not
speak
and
the
gentleman
proceeded
i
am
apothecary
to
sir
robert
household
and
as
my
excellent
employer
has
been
long
afflicted
with
an
ill
state
of
health
i
live
in
a
small
lodge
at
the
other
end
of
the
park
he
is
the
boast
of
the
county
the
best
landlord
and
the
kindest
neighbor
all
ranks
of
people
love
him
and
when
he
dies
which
his
late
apoplectic
fits
make
it
too
probable
may
be
soon
both
poor
and
rich
will
lose
their
friend
ill
as
he
was
this
morning
when
i
told
him
you
were
out
of
danger
he
expressed
a
pleasure
which
did
him
more
good
than
all
my
medicines
not
considering
the
wildness
of
the
question
thaddeus
hastily
demanded
does
he
know
who
i
am
the
honest
apothecary
stared
at
the
look
and
tone
with
which
these
words
were
delivered
and
then
replied
no
sir
is
there
any
reason
to
make
you
wish
that
he
should
not
certainly
none
replied
thaddeus
recollecting
himself
but
i
shall
be
impatient
until
i
have
an
opportunity
of
telling
him
how
grateful
i
am
for
the
goodness
he
has
shown
to
me
as
a
stranger
surprised
at
these
hints
which
the
count
not
considering
their
tendency
allowed
to
escape
him
the
apothecary
gathered
sufficient
from
them
united
with
the
speaker
superior
mien
to
make
him
suppose
that
his
patient
was
some
emigrant
of
quality
whom
sir
robert
would
rejoice
in
having
served
these
surmises
and
conclusions
having
passed
quickly
through
the
worthy
gentleman
brain
he
bowed
his
head
with
that
respect
which
the
generous
mind
is
proud
to
pay
to
nobility
in
ruins
and
resumed
whoever
you
may
be
sir
a
peasant
or
a
prince
you
will
meet
with
british
hospitality
from
the
noble
owner
of
this
mansion
the
magnificence
of
his
spirit
is
equalled
by
the
goodness
of
his
heart
and
i
am
certain
that
sir
robert
will
consider
as
fortunate
the
severe
attack
which
bringing
him
from
somerset
for
change
of
air
has
afforded
him
an
opportunity
of
serving
you
thaddeus
blushed
at
the
strain
of
this
speech
readily
understanding
what
was
passing
in
the
mind
of
the
apothecary
he
hardly
knew
what
to
reply
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
said
all
you
have
declared
sir
in
praise
of
sir
robert
somerset
i
can
not
doubt
is
deserving
i
have
already
felt
the
effects
of
his
humanity
and
shall
ever
remember
that
my
life
was
prolonged
by
his
means
but
i
have
no
pretensions
to
the
honor
of
his
acquaintance
i
only
wish
to
see
him
that
i
may
thank
him
for
what
he
has
done
therefore
if
you
will
permit
me
to
rise
this
evening
instead
of
morning
you
will
oblige
me
to
this
request
the
apothecary
gave
a
respectful
yet
firm
denial
and
went
down
stairs
to
communicate
his
observations
to
his
patron
when
he
returned
he
brought
back
a
request
for
his
patient
from
the
baronet
even
as
a
personal
consideration
for
his
host
solicitude
concerning
him
to
remain
quietly
in
the
perfect
repose
of
his
closed
chamber
until
next
day
then
it
might
be
hoped
sir
robert
would
find
him
sufficiently
recovered
to
receive
his
visit
without
risk
to
this
sobieski
could
not
but
assent
in
common
courtesy
as
well
as
in
grateful
feeling
yet
he
passed
in
anything
but
repose
the
rest
of
the
day
and
the
anxiety
which
continued
to
agitate
him
while
reflecting
that
he
was
receiving
these
obligations
from
his
implacable
enemy
so
occupied
and
disturbed
him
that
he
spent
a
sleepless
night
the
dawn
found
his
fever
much
augmented
but
no
corporeal
sufferings
could
persuade
him
to
defer
seeing
the
baronet
and
immediately
leaving
his
house
believing
as
he
did
that
all
this
kindness
would
have
been
withheld
had
his
host
known
on
whom
he
was
pouring
such
benefits
he
thought
that
every
minute
which
passed
over
him
while
under
sir
robert
roof
inflicted
a
new
outrage
on
his
own
respect
and
honor
to
this
end
then
as
soon
as
middleton
the
apothecary
retired
to
breakfast
thaddeus
rose
from
his
bed
and
was
completely
dressed
before
he
returned
he
had
effected
this
without
any
assistance
for
he
was
in
possession
of
his
one
of
the
outriders
having
discerned
it
amongst
the
herbage
while
the
others
were
busied
in
carrying
its
helpless
owner
to
the
carriage
he
had
picked
it
up
and
on
the
arrival
of
the
party
at
home
delivered
it
to
the
baronet
valet
to
convey
to
the
invalid
gentleman
chamber
justly
considering
that
he
would
require
its
contents
when
middleton
the
apartment
and
saw
his
patient
not
only
risen
from
his
bed
but
so
completely
dressed
he
expostulated
on
the
rashness
of
what
he
had
done
and
augured
no
less
than
a
dangerous
relapse
from
the
present
increased
state
of
his
pulse
thaddeus
for
once
in
his
life
was
obstinate
though
civilly
so
and
desiring
a
servant
to
request
that
sir
robert
would
indulge
him
with
an
audience
for
a
few
minutes
alone
in
his
library
he
soon
convinced
middleton
that
his
purpose
was
not
to
be
shaken
the
baronet
returning
his
compliments
and
saying
that
he
should
be
happy
to
see
his
guest
the
still
anxious
apothecary
offered
him
his
assistance
down
stairs
thaddeus
needed
no
help
and
gratefully
declined
it
the
exertion
necessary
to
be
summoned
for
this
interview
imparted
as
much
momentary
strength
to
his
frame
as
to
his
mind
and
though
his
color
was
heightened
he
entered
the
library
with
a
firm
step
sir
robert
met
him
at
the
door
and
shaking
him
by
the
hand
with
a
warm
assurance
of
pleasure
at
so
rapid
a
restoration
would
have
led
him
to
a
seat
but
thaddeus
only
supported
himself
against
the
back
of
it
with
his
hand
whilst
in
a
steady
voice
he
expressed
the
most
earnest
thanks
for
the
benefits
he
had
received
then
pausing
and
casting
the
proud
lustre
of
his
eyes
to
the
ground
lest
their
language
should
tell
all
that
he
thought
he
continued
i
have
only
to
regret
sir
robert
that
your
benevolence
has
been
lavished
on
a
man
whom
you
regard
with
abhorrence
i
am
the
count
sobieski
that
polander
whom
you
commanded
your
son
to
see
no
more
respecting
even
the
prejudices
of
my
friend
parent
i
was
hastening
to
london
meaning
to
set
sail
for
america
with
the
first
ship
when
i
swooned
on
the
road
i
believe
i
was
expiring
your
humanity
saved
me
and
i
now
owe
to
gratitude
as
well
as
to
my
own
satisfaction
the
fulfilment
of
my
determination
i
shall
leave
deerhurst
immediately
and
england
as
soon
as
i
am
able
to
embark
thaddeus
with
a
second
bow
and
not
quite
so
firm
a
step
without
venturing
a
glance
at
what
he
supposed
must
be
the
abashed
or
the
enraged
looks
of
pembroke
father
was
preparing
to
quit
the
room
when
sir
robert
with
a
pale
and
ghastly
countenance
exclaimed
stop
thaddeus
looked
round
and
struck
by
the
change
in
his
appearance
paused
in
his
movement
the
baronet
incapable
of
saying
more
pointed
to
a
chair
for
him
to
sit
down
then
sinking
into
another
himself
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiping
away
the
large
drops
which
stood
on
his
forehead
panted
for
respiration
at
last
with
a
desperate
kind
of
haste
he
said
was
your
mother
indeed
therese
sobieski
thaddeus
still
more
astonished
replied
in
the
affirmative
sir
robert
threw
himself
back
on
the
chair
with
a
deep
groan
hardly
knowing
what
he
did
the
count
rose
from
his
seat
and
advanced
towards
him
on
his
approach
sir
robert
stretched
out
his
hand
and
with
a
look
and
tone
of
agony
said
who
was
your
father
he
then
without
waiting
for
a
reply
covered
his
convulsed
features
with
his
handkerchief
the
baronet
agitation
which
now
shook
him
like
an
earthquake
became
contagious
thaddeus
gazed
at
him
with
a
palsying
uncertainty
in
his
heart
laying
his
hand
on
his
bewildered
brain
he
answered
i
know
not
yet
i
fear
i
must
believe
him
to
be
the
earl
of
tinemouth
but
here
is
his
picture
with
an
almost
disabling
tremor
he
unclasped
it
from
his
neck
where
his
mother
last
blessing
had
placed
it
and
touching
the
spring
which
held
it
in
its
little
gold
case
in
the
manner
of
a
watch
he
gave
it
open
to
sir
robert
who
had
started
from
his
seat
at
the
name
of
the
earl
the
moment
the
baronet
eyes
rested
on
the
miniature
he
fell
senseless
upon
the
chair
thaddeus
hardly
more
alive
sprinkled
some
water
on
his
face
and
with
throbbing
temples
and
a
bleeding
heart
stood
in
wordless
expectation
over
him
such
excessive
emotion
told
him
that
something
more
than
sir
robert
hatred
of
the
polanders
had
stimulated
his
late
conduct
too
earnest
for
an
explanation
to
ring
for
assistance
he
rejoiced
to
see
by
the
convulsion
of
the
baronet
features
and
the
heaving
of
his
chest
that
animation
was
returning
in
a
few
minutes
he
opened
his
eyes
but
when
he
met
the
anxious
gaze
of
thaddeus
he
closed
them
as
suddenly
rising
from
his
seat
he
staggered
against
the
exclaiming
oh
god
direct
me
thaddeus
whose
conjectures
were
now
wrought
almost
to
wildness
followed
him
and
whilst
his
exhausted
frame
was
ready
to
sink
to
the
earth
he
implored
him
to
speak
sir
robert
cried
he
if
you
know
anything
of
my
family
if
you
know
anything
of
my
father
i
beseech
you
to
answer
me
or
only
tell
me
am
i
so
wretched
as
to
be
the
son
of
lord
tinemouth
the
violence
of
the
count
emotions
during
this
agonizing
address
totally
overcame
him
before
he
finished
speaking
his
limbs
withdrew
their
support
and
he
dropped
breathless
against
the
side
of
the
chair
sir
robert
turned
hastily
round
he
saw
him
sunk
like
a
beautiful
flower
bruised
and
trampled
on
by
the
foot
of
him
who
had
given
it
root
unable
to
make
any
evasive
reply
to
this
last
appeal
of
virtue
and
of
nature
he
threw
himself
with
a
burst
of
tears
upon
his
neck
and
exclaimed
wretch
that
i
have
been
oh
sobieski
i
am
thy
father
dear
injured
son
of
the
too
faithful
therese
the
first
words
which
carried
this
avowal
to
the
heart
of
thaddeus
deprived
it
of
motion
and
when
sir
robert
expected
to
receive
the
returning
embrace
of
his
son
he
found
him
senseless
in
his
arms
the
cries
of
the
baronet
brought
middleton
and
the
servants
into
the
room
when
the
former
saw
the
state
of
the
count
and
perceived
the
agonized
position
of
his
patron
who
was
supporting
and
leaning
over
his
son
the
honest
man
declared
that
he
expected
nothing
less
from
the
gentleman
disobedience
of
his
orders
the
presence
of
the
servants
having
recalled
sir
robert
wandering
faculties
he
desired
them
to
remove
the
invalid
with
the
greatest
care
back
to
his
chamber
following
them
in
silence
when
they
had
laid
their
charge
on
the
bed
he
watched
in
extreme
but
concealed
suspense
till
middleton
once
more
succeeded
in
restoring
animation
to
his
patient
the
moment
the
count
unclosed
his
eyes
they
fixed
themselves
on
his
father
he
drew
the
hand
which
held
his
to
his
lips
the
tears
of
paternal
love
again
bathed
the
cheeks
of
sir
robert
he
felt
how
warm
at
his
heart
was
the
affection
of
his
deserted
son
making
a
sign
for
middleton
to
leave
the
room
who
obeyed
he
bent
his
streaming
eyes
upon
the
other
hand
of
thaddeus
and
in
a
faltering
voice
can
you
pardon
me
thaddeus
threw
himself
on
his
father
bosom
and
wept
profusely
then
raising
sir
robert
clasped
hands
to
his
whilst
his
eloquent
eyes
seemed
to
search
the
heavens
he
said
my
dear
dear
mother
loved
you
to
her
latest
hour
and
i
have
all
my
mother
heart
whatever
may
have
been
his
errors
i
love
and
honor
my
father
sir
robert
strained
him
to
his
breast
after
a
pause
whilst
he
shook
the
tears
from
his
venerated
cheeks
he
resumed
certain
my
dear
son
that
you
require
repose
and
assured
that
you
will
not
find
it
until
i
have
offered
some
apology
for
my
unnatural
conduct
i
will
now
explain
the
circumstances
which
impelled
my
actions
and
drew
distress
upon
that
noble
being
your
mother
sir
robert
hesitated
a
moment
to
recover
breath
and
then
with
the
verity
of
a
grateful
penitence
commenced
keep
your
situation
added
he
putting
down
thaddeus
who
at
this
opening
was
raising
himself
i
shall
tell
my
melancholy
story
with
less
pain
if
your
eyes
be
not
upon
me
i
will
begin
from
the
first
the
baronet
with
frequent
agitated
pauses
proceeded
to
relate
what
may
be
more
succinctly
expressed
as
follows
very
early
in
life
he
had
attached
himself
to
miss
edith
beaufort
the
only
sister
of
the
late
admiral
beaufort
who
at
that
time
was
pursuing
his
chosen
brave
career
as
in
the
british
navy
by
the
successive
deaths
of
their
parents
they
had
been
left
young
to
the
guardianship
of
sir
fulke
somerset
and
their
maternal
aunt
his
then
accomplished
lady
she
and
their
deceased
mother
the
lady
grace
beaufort
having
been
sisters
the
two
celebrated
beautiful
daughters
of
robert
earl
studeley
of
warwick
sir
fulke
family
by
the
amiable
twin
of
the
lady
grace
were
robert
who
afterwards
succeeded
him
and
dorothy
his
only
daughter
but
he
had
a
son
by
a
former
marriage
with
the
widow
of
a
governor
in
the
east
who
having
died
on
his
voyage
home
to
england
on
her
landing
she
found
herself
the
sole
inheritrix
of
his
immense
wealth
she
possessed
charms
of
person
as
well
as
riches
and
as
soon
as
her
weeds
could
be
laid
aside
she
became
the
admired
wife
of
the
gay
and
gallant
sir
fulke
somerset
within
the
twelve
subsequent
months
she
presented
him
with
a
son
and
heir
soon
to
be
her
own
too
for
though
she
lived
three
or
four
years
after
his
birth
her
health
became
so
delicate
that
she
never
bore
another
child
but
gradually
declined
and
ultimately
expired
while
apparently
in
a
gentle
sleep
sir
fulke
mourned
his
due
time
in
the
customary
suit
of
solemn
black
but
he
was
a
man
of
a
lofty
and
social
spirit
by
no
means
inclined
to
be
disconsolate
and
held
a
fair
to
be
an
indispensable
appendage
to
his
domestic
state
in
this
temper
just
before
the
election
of
a
new
parliament
when
contending
interests
were
running
very
close
he
obtained
the
not
less
eagerly
disputed
hand
of
lady
arabella
studeley
whose
elder
sister
as
has
been
mentioned
had
made
a
magnificent
marriage
only
a
year
or
two
before
with
john
of
beaufort
the
lord
of
the
noble
domain
of
beaufort
in
the
weald
of
kent
a
lineal
endowment
from
his
princely
ancestor
john
of
gaunt
this
illustrious
pair
dwelt
on
the
land
like
its
munificent
owners
in
the
olden
times
revered
and
beloved
and
they
were
the
parents
of
their
two
representatives
guy
afterwards
admiral
beaufort
and
edith
who
subsequently
became
the
adored
wife
of
her
also
cousin
robert
somerset
but
before
that
event
took
place
the
young
lover
had
to
pass
through
a
path
of
thorns
some
of
which
pierced
him
to
the
end
from
his
childhood
to
manhood
he
saw
little
of
algernon
his
elder
brother
who
always
seemed
to
him
more
like
an
occasional
brilliant
phantom
alighting
amongst
them
than
a
dear
member
of
the
family
coming
delightedly
to
cheer
and
to
share
his
paternal
home
algernon
was
either
at
eaton
school
or
at
one
of
the
universities
or
travelling
somewhere
on
the
continent
and
at
all
these
places
or
from
them
all
he
became
the
enchanted
theme
of
every
tongue
meanwhile
robert
though
perhaps
equally
endowed
by
nature
yet
certainly
of
a
milder
radiance
was
the
object
of
so
apprehensive
a
solicitude
in
his
gentle
mother
breast
for
the
puritas
well
as
the
intellectual
accomplishments
of
her
son
that
she
obtained
sir
fulke
reluctant
consent
to
his
being
brought
up
in
what
is
called
a
home
education
that
is
under
the
especial
personal
care
of
the
best
private
tutors
and
which
were
found
to
the
great
credit
of
her
judgment
he
showed
an
ardent
devotedness
to
his
studies
and
though
like
his
mother
he
was
one
of
the
mildest
of
human
beings
in
his
dealings
with
those
around
him
yet
his
aspirations
towards
high
attainments
were
as
energetic
as
they
were
noiseless
and
ever
on
steady
wind
soaring
upward
robert
somerset
was
then
unconsciously
forming
himself
for
what
he
afterwards
became
the
boast
of
the
country
of
his
birth
the
glory
of
england
to
whose
prosperity
he
dedicated
all
his
noble
talents
showing
what
it
is
to
be
a
true
english
country
gentleman
being
alike
the
oak
or
laurel
of
old
england
fields
and
groves
with
sickle
or
with
sword
or
bardic
minstrelsy
he
was
permitted
to
pass
a
term
or
two
at
oxford
where
he
acquitted
himself
with
honor
particularly
in
the
classics
to
the
repeated
admiration
of
their
then
celebrated
professor
the
late
thomas
warton
but
the
young
student
was
also
fond
of
rural
pursuits
and
domestic
occupations
he
lived
mostly
at
home
enjoying
the
gentle
solace
of
elegant
modern
literature
and
the
graces
of
music
with
the
ever
blameless
delights
of
an
accomplished
female
society
at
the
head
of
which
his
revered
mother
had
presided
accompanied
by
his
lively
sister
dorothy
and
the
sweet
edith
beaufort
whom
he
had
gradually
learned
to
love
like
his
own
soul
his
heart
became
yet
more
closely
knit
to
her
when
his
beloved
parent
died
which
sad
event
occurred
about
a
year
after
the
death
of
edith
own
mother
who
on
her
widowhood
had
continued
to
live
more
with
her
sister
lady
arabella
somerset
than
at
her
bereaved
home
edith
filial
sorrow
was
renewed
in
the
loss
of
her
maternal
aunt
and
her
tenderest
sympathy
reciprocated
the
tears
of
her
son
their
hearts
blended
together
in
those
tears
and
both
felt
that
they
were
comforted
time
did
not
long
pass
on
before
the
happy
robert
communicated
their
mutual
attachment
to
his
father
petitioning
for
his
consent
to
woo
for
the
hand
of
her
whose
heart
he
had
already
gained
but
the
baronet
in
some
surprise
at
what
he
heard
refused
to
give
his
sanction
to
any
such
premature
engagement
first
on
account
of
the
applicant
extreme
youth
and
second
being
a
younger
scion
of
his
house
it
might
not
be
deemed
well
of
in
the
world
should
he
the
guardian
of
his
niece
and
her
splendid
fortune
show
so
much
haste
to
bestow
her
on
his
comparatively
portionless
son
the
baronet
with
some
of
his
parliamentary
acumen
drew
another
comparison
which
touched
the
disappointed
lover
with
a
feeling
almost
of
despair
he
compared
what
he
denominated
his
romantic
fancies
for
woods
and
wilds
and
pursuits
in
the
old
crypts
of
the
castle
or
the
college
with
the
distinguished
consideration
held
by
his
travelled
brother
in
courts
and
councils
whether
abroad
or
at
home
closing
the
parallel
by
telling
him
to
follow
algernon
example
and
become
more
like
a
man
of
some
account
amongst
men
before
he
dared
pretend
to
a
hand
of
so
much
importance
as
that
of
the
heiress
of
beaufort
robert
was
standing
silent
and
dismayed
as
one
struck
by
a
flash
when
his
brother
who
had
been
only
a
month
arrived
from
a
long
revisit
to
the
two
sicilies
suddenly
entered
his
library
as
sir
fulke
had
again
resumed
his
discourse
with
even
more
severity
at
sight
of
the
animated
object
of
his
contrasting
eulogy
he
instantly
described
to
his
new
auditor
what
had
been
mutually
said
and
referred
the
subject
to
him
romance
indeed
whether
in
merry
sherwood
with
hound
and
horn
or
with
gentle
dames
in
bower
and
hall
you
have
had
enough
of
my
brother
replied
the
traveller
neither
men
nor
women
like
philandering
after
deer
or
doe
or
a
lady
slipper
beyond
the
greenwood
season
so
i
say
for
the
glory
of
your
manhood
up
and
away
abroad
abroad
my
father
is
right
that
is
the
only
ground
for
such
a
race
and
guerdon
as
you
aspire
to
i
admire
your
taste
and
not
less
your
ambition
my
brave
boy
do
not
thwart
him
sir
fulke
added
he
to
the
baronet
who
began
to
frown
let
him
enter
the
lists
with
the
boldest
of
us
faint
heart
never
won
fair
lady
so
forward
robert
and
give
me
another
sweet
sister
to
love
and
to
cherish
as
i
do
our
blithe
little
dora
at
this
far
from
unwelcome
advice
robert
smiled
and
sighed
but
the
smile
swallowed
up
the
sigh
for
his
soul
kindled
with
hope
his
father
smiled
also
the
cloud
of
a
stern
authority
had
passed
from
his
brow
and
before
that
now
perfectly
reconciled
party
rose
it
was
decided
that
robert
should
make
immediate
preparations
for
commencing
a
regulated
course
of
continental
travels
the
route
to
be
drawn
out
by
his
brother
and
his
expenses
in
the
tour
to
be
liberally
supplied
by
his
father
the
length
of
the
probation
was
not
then
thought
on
at
least
not
mentioned
shortly
afterwards
when
robert
hastened
from
the
library
to
communicate
what
had
passed
to
the
beloved
object
of
the
discussion
he
left
his
father
and
his
brother
together
to
think
and
to
plan
all
the
rest
for
him
but
edith
beaufort
wept
when
she
heard
of
the
separation
her
heart
failed
within
her
for
since
her
first
coming
under
the
roof
of
her
guardian
uncle
she
had
never
been
without
seeing
her
cousin
beyond
a
few
days
or
weeks
at
most
he
was
now
going
to
be
banished
and
it
was
asserted
for
her
sake
too
into
far
distant
countries
and
for
an
indefinite
period
months
perhaps
years
and
these
saddening
thoughts
made
her
weep
afresh
though
silently
for
her
tears
were
soft
and
noiseless
like
the
heart
from
whence
they
sprung
robert
with
all
his
now
sanguine
expectations
sought
to
cheer
her
but
in
vain
she
felt
an
impression
that
should
he
go
they
would
never
meet
again
but
she
did
not
betray
that
feeling
to
him
yet
the
infection
of
her
despondency
by
its
continuance
so
wrought
on
his
own
consequent
depressed
spirits
that
when
his
father
announced
to
him
that
his
absence
must
be
for
two
or
three
years
at
least
he
ventured
to
remonstrate
beseeching
that
it
might
be
limited
to
the
shorter
term
of
two
years
the
baronet
derided
the
proposal
with
many
words
of
contempt
towards
the
urgent
pleader
robert
withheld
from
disclosing
to
the
too
often
hard
mind
of
his
father
that
the
proposition
he
so
scorned
had
originated
in
the
tender
bosom
of
edith
beaufort
and
sir
fulke
sarcasm
fell
so
thick
on
the
bending
head
of
his
son
that
at
last
the
insulted
feelings
of
the
generous
lover
became
so
indignant
at
the
little
confidence
placed
in
the
real
manliness
of
his
character
which
had
hitherto
been
found
ever
present
when
actually
called
for
that
his
heart
began
to
swell
to
an
almost
uncontrollable
exasperation
and
while
struggling
to
master
himself
from
uttering
the
disrespectful
retort
risen
to
his
lips
his
brother
again
accidentally
entered
the
room
and
by
giving
robert
the
moment
to
pause
happily
rescued
his
tottering
duty
from
that
regretful
offence
as
soon
as
algernon
appeared
the
baronet
resumed
his
sarcastic
tone
in
a
rapid
recapitulation
of
robert
retrograde
request
algernon
again
took
up
the
cause
of
his
brother
and
with
his
usual
tact
gained
the
victory
by
the
dexterous
gayety
with
which
he
pleaded
for
the
young
noviciate
in
all
the
matters
for
which
he
was
to
be
sent
so
far
afield
to
learn
at
last
the
conference
ended
by
sir
fulke
agreeing
to
a
proposition
from
his
eldest
son
that
the
time
for
this
foreign
tutelage
might
possibly
expire
within
the
second
year
should
the
results
evoked
by
the
ambitious
passion
of
his
youngest
born
be
in
any
fair
progress
to
fulfilment
in
little
more
than
a
week
after
this
final
arrangement
every
preparation
was
finished
for
the
tour
robert
had
taken
a
adieu
from
his
beloved
edith
but
by
his
father
positive
injunction
there
was
no
engagement
for
a
hereafter
actual
plighting
of
hands
made
between
them
yet
their
eloquent
eyes
transparent
through
their
mutual
tears
vowed
it
to
each
other
and
with
silent
prayers
for
his
indeed
early
return
they
parted
when
taking
leave
of
his
father
and
receiving
his
directions
relative
to
a
correspondence
with
his
family
permission
was
peremptorily
denied
him
to
hold
any
with
his
cousin
edith
he
had
learned
enough
lately
to
avoid
all
supplications
to
the
paternal
quarter
if
he
would
not
invite
scorn
as
well
as
to
receive
disappointment
but
algernon
whispered
to
him
that
nobody
should
remain
wholly
to
him
in
that
house
while
he
dipped
pen
in
any
one
of
the
three
hundred
and
inkhorns
under
its
awful
towers
robert
then
bowed
his
farewell
with
a
flushed
cheek
and
grave
respect
to
his
father
but
gratefully
separated
from
his
brother
with
a
warm
pressure
of
the
hand
the
old
household
servants
blessed
him
as
he
passed
through
the
hall
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
found
himself
seated
in
the
family
and
four
that
was
to
convey
him
from
the
home
of
his
youth
and
happy
innocence
and
alas
to
return
to
it
an
altered
man
when
he
reached
dover
to
embark
he
fell
in
with
the
present
earl
of
tinemouth
then
stanhope
sent
abroad
on
a
similar
errand
with
himself
but
stanhope
was
to
forget
a
mistress
somerset
to
merit
the
one
he
sought
the
two
young
men
were
kinsfolk
by
birth
and
they
now
felt
themselves
so
in
severing
from
their
parents
stanhope
was
in
high
wrath
against
his
and
he
soon
rekindled
the
already
excited
mind
of
somerset
to
a
responsive
demonstration
of
resentment
they
determined
to
show
that
they
were
not
such
boys
as
to
submit
any
further
in
passive
obedience
to
the
stern
authority
dominating
over
them
sir
fulke
particular
charge
against
his
son
was
a
womanish
softness
unworthy
his
loftier
sex
show
him
cried
stanhope
that
you
have
the
hardihood
of
a
true
man
by
an
immediate
act
of
independence
let
us
travel
together
kinsmen
as
we
are
change
our
names
and
let
no
one
in
england
know
anything
about
us
during
our
tour
except
the
two
dear
women
on
whose
accounts
we
are
thus
transported
with
these
views
they
landed
in
france
gave
themselves
out
to
be
brothers
which
a
certain
resemblance
in
their
persons
corroborated
and
called
themselves
sackville
agreeably
amused
with
the
novelties
presented
to
them
at
almost
every
step
of
their
tour
from
gay
paris
to
sentimental
italy
they
proceeded
pretty
amicably
until
they
reached
naples
there
stanhope
involved
himself
in
an
intrigue
with
the
only
daughter
of
an
old
british
officer
who
had
retired
to
that
climate
for
his
health
somerset
remonstrated
on
the
villany
of
seducing
an
innocent
girl
when
he
knew
his
heart
and
hand
were
pledged
to
another
stanhope
enraged
at
finding
a
censor
in
a
companion
whom
he
had
considered
to
be
as
headstrong
as
himself
ended
the
argument
by
drawing
his
sword
and
if
the
servants
of
the
hotel
had
not
interfered
the
affray
would
probably
have
terminated
with
one
of
their
lives
since
that
hour
they
never
met
stanhope
fled
from
his
shame
and
his
bleeding
friend
and
fearful
of
consequences
took
temporary
refuge
in
one
of
the
aonian
isles
not
daring
to
proceed
any
further
against
the
innocence
of
the
poor
officer
daughter
who
had
been
thus
rescued
from
becoming
his
victim
when
recovered
from
his
wound
robert
somerset
by
some
strange
infatuation
still
retaining
the
name
of
sackville
proceeded
to
florence
in
which
interesting
city
for
works
of
art
ancient
and
modern
and
the
graces
of
classic
society
determining
to
stay
some
time
he
rather
sought
than
repelled
the
civilities
of
the
inhabitants
here
he
became
acquainted
with
the
palatine
and
the
lovely
countess
therese
his
daughter
her
beauty
pleased
his
taste
her
gentle
virtues
and
exquisite
accomplishments
affected
both
his
heart
and
mind
and
he
often
gazed
on
her
with
tenderness
when
his
fidelity
to
edith
beaufort
only
meant
him
to
convey
a
look
of
grateful
admiration
the
palatine
honored
england
and
was
prepared
to
esteem
her
sons
wherever
he
might
meet
them
and
very
soon
he
became
so
attached
to
this
apparently
lonely
young
traveller
that
he
invited
him
to
all
the
excursions
he
and
his
daughter
made
into
the
adjoining
states
whether
visiting
them
by
the
romantic
scenery
of
the
or
coasting
the
beautiful
bays
of
the
sublime
shores
on
either
side
of
those
parts
of
the
mediterranean
in
the
midst
of
this
intimacy
as
if
she
were
aware
of
a
friendship
so
hostile
to
his
cousin
love
he
suddenly
ceased
to
receive
any
from
her
to
him
in
the
two
last
letters
from
his
brother
for
he
had
never
allowed
himself
to
so
brave
his
father
parting
commands
as
to
write
to
her
himself
desperate
with
jealousy
of
some
unknown
object
supplanting
him
he
was
on
the
point
of
setting
off
for
home
to
judge
with
his
own
eyes
when
a
large
packet
from
england
was
put
into
his
hands
on
opening
it
he
found
a
letter
from
edith
on
which
his
surprised
and
eager
gaze
had
immediately
fixed
without
looking
on
any
of
the
rest
he
broke
the
seal
and
read
astounded
by
the
contents
that
having
for
some
time
been
led
to
consider
the
probable
consequences
to
him
both
from
his
father
better
judgment
and
the
ultimate
opinion
of
the
world
should
he
and
she
continue
their
pertinacious
adherence
to
their
childish
attachment
she
had
tried
to
wean
both
him
and
herself
from
so
rebellious
a
folly
towards
her
revered
guardian
his
honored
father
and
trusting
that
the
gradual
shortening
of
her
messages
to
him
through
his
brother
letters
must
have
had
the
effect
intended
she
now
had
permission
to
write
one
herself
to
him
to
convince
him
at
once
of
the
unreasonableness
and
danger
of
all
such
premature
entanglements
for
she
added
soon
after
his
departure
a
journey
to
town
had
taught
her
to
know
her
own
heart
she
learned
to
feel
that
it
was
still
at
her
disposal
and
time
did
not
long
pass
after
she
returned
to
the
country
before
having
compared
the
object
of
her
awakened
taste
with
that
of
her
former
delusion
she
persuaded
her
own
better
judgment
to
set
a
generous
example
to
her
cousin
robert
by
marrying
where
that
judgment
now
pointed
and
so
with
the
full
consent
of
sir
fulke
who
she
well
knew
had
been
totally
averse
to
her
marriage
with
his
youngest
son
she
had
yielded
to
the
long
love
of
his
brother
which
had
been
struggling
in
his
manly
bosom
many
agonizing
months
against
his
persistent
fidelity
to
robert
but
whose
sister
she
hoped
to
shortly
become
as
his
affectionate
edith
then
somerset
having
read
this
extraordinary
epistle
to
the
end
so
monstrous
in
the
character
of
its
sentiments
and
its
language
when
compared
with
all
he
had
hitherto
known
of
the
pure
and
simple
mind
from
which
it
came
a
terrible
revulsion
seized
on
his
own
and
almost
maddened
with
horror
at
every
name
in
that
letter
he
foreswore
his
family
forever
hastening
as
for
one
drop
of
heaven
dew
upon
his
burning
brain
to
seek
therese
sobieski
he
found
her
alone
and
though
without
such
aim
when
he
rushed
so
frenzied
into
her
presence
he
besought
her
to
heal
a
miserable
and
broken
heart
which
could
only
be
saved
to
endure
any
continuance
of
life
by
an
acknowledgment
that
she
loved
him
alas
the
avowal
was
too
soon
wrung
from
that
tender
and
noble
spirit
and
yielding
to
a
paroxysm
of
a
rash
and
blinding
revenge
he
hurried
her
to
a
neighboring
convent
and
secretly
married
her
this
most
unrighteous
act
perpetrated
he
in
vain
sought
tranquillity
he
was
now
stung
within
by
a
constant
sense
of
increasing
guilt
before
this
act
he
was
the
injured
party
injured
by
those
in
whom
he
had
confided
his
dearest
earthly
happiness
and
he
could
raise
his
head
in
conscious
truth
though
all
his
fondest
hopes
had
been
wrecked
by
their
falsehood
but
now
he
was
the
betrayer
of
a
young
and
innocent
heart
which
had
implicitly
trusted
in
him
and
he
had
insulted
with
a
base
and
treacherous
ingratitude
by
that
act
of
deceit
without
excuse
the
honor
of
her
father
whose
generous
confidence
had
also
been
implicitly
placed
in
him
but
the
effects
of
these
scorpion
reproaches
in
his
bosom
were
not
less
destructive
of
her
peace
than
of
his
own
he
saw
that
his
wedded
therese
was
unweariedly
anxious
to
soothe
the
mysterious
wanderings
of
his
mind
with
her
softest
tenderness
but
his
thoughts
were
indeed
far
from
her
ever
hovering
over
the
changed
image
of
his
so
lately
adored
edith
ever
agonizing
over
the
lightness
of
a
conduct
so
unlike
her
former
virgin
delicacy
so
unlike
the
clinging
vows
she
breathed
to
him
in
their
hour
of
boding
separation
ever
execrating
the
perfidy
of
his
brother
which
had
brought
on
him
this
distracting
load
of
guilt
and
woe
in
this
temper
of
alienation
from
all
the
world
a
second
packet
from
england
was
put
into
his
hand
again
he
saw
edith
writing
but
he
dropped
it
unopened
in
horror
of
the
signature
he
anticipated
would
be
appended
to
it
roused
by
resentment
towards
him
whose
name
he
believed
she
then
bore
he
tore
asunder
the
wax
of
a
letter
from
his
father
which
was
sealed
with
black
his
eyes
were
speedily
riveted
to
it
sir
fulke
in
the
language
of
deep
contrition
confessed
a
train
of
deception
that
petrified
his
son
he
declared
with
bitter
invectives
against
himself
that
all
which
had
been
communicated
to
that
unhappy
son
relating
to
edith
and
her
intended
marriage
with
algernon
had
been
devised
by
that
unkind
brother
and
his
no
less
unnatural
father
for
the
treacherous
purpose
of
that
marriage
devoted
to
ambition
for
his
own
sake
as
well
as
for
that
of
his
favorite
son
sir
fulke
owned
that
he
had
from
the
first
of
edith
beaufort
becoming
his
ward
resolved
on
her
union
in
due
time
with
algernon
in
order
to
endow
him
in
addition
to
his
own
rich
inheritance
with
all
the
political
influence
attendant
on
the
vast
estate
to
which
she
was
heiress
and
so
build
up
the
family
in
the
consideration
of
government
to
any
pitch
of
coroneted
rank
their
parent
might
choose
to
reclaim
with
many
prayers
for
pardon
from
heaven
and
the
robert
the
wretched
father
acknowledged
that
this
confession
was
wrung
from
him
by
the
sudden
death
of
his
eldest
son
who
having
been
thrown
off
his
horse
on
a
heap
of
stones
in
the
after
three
days
of
severe
bodily
and
mental
suffering
now
lay
a
disfigured
corpse
under
the
vainly
mourning
blazonry
of
his
house
in
the
darkened
hall
of
his
ancestors
the
disconsolate
narrator
then
added
that
in
contrite
repentance
his
son
had
conjured
him
with
his
dying
breath
to
confess
the
falsehood
of
all
that
had
passed
to
the
robert
amongst
which
was
algernon
turning
to
the
account
of
his
own
designs
every
confidence
imparted
to
him
by
his
brother
in
his
movements
and
awakened
intimacy
with
the
noble
sarmatian
family
at
florence
and
from
these
unsuspected
sources
this
false
friend
and
kinsman
had
contrived
to
throw
out
hints
of
his
brother
reported
sliding
heart
to
the
shrinking
object
of
his
own
base
and
perfidious
passion
at
last
believing
robert
to
be
unfaithful
she
sunk
into
a
depression
of
spirits
which
sir
fulke
thought
would
be
easy
to
work
to
an
assent
in
mere
reckless
melancholy
to
the
union
he
sought
with
that
object
and
to
break
the
knot
at
once
by
a
trenchant
blow
on
side
algernon
forged
that
letter
in
edith
beaufort
handwriting
which
had
announced
so
unblushingly
her
preparations
for
an
immediate
marriage
with
the
eldest
son
but
continued
sir
fulke
death
has
put
an
end
to
this
unnatural
rivalry
and
my
poor
girl
undeceived
in
her
opinion
of
you
longs
to
see
you
and
to
give
you
that
hand
which
your
brother
and
infatuated
father
so
unjustly
detained
from
you
you
are
now
my
only
son
the
only
prop
of
my
house
the
only
comfort
of
my
old
age
my
son
do
not
abandon
to
his
remorse
and
sorrow
your
only
parent
on
receipt
of
this
packet
in
a
consternation
of
amazement
and
a
soul
divided
between
rekindled
love
in
all
its
fires
and
pity
and
honor
towards
her
he
had
betrayed
before
the
altar
of
heaven
robert
somerset
sacrificed
both
to
his
imperious
passion
he
adored
the
woman
on
whose
account
he
had
left
the
country
and
though
every
tie
sacred
and
just
bound
him
to
the
tender
and
faithful
wife
he
must
forsake
to
regain
that
idol
he
at
once
consigned
her
to
the
full
horrors
of
desertion
and
hastened
to
england
disgraceful
to
relate
ejaculated
sir
robert
putting
his
hand
over
his
face
i
married
edith
beaufort
while
in
our
deepest
mourning
but
at
somerset
as
the
place
farthest
from
general
notice
my
father
eager
to
efface
as
fast
as
possible
from
my
mind
and
hers
all
recollection
of
his
past
conduct
towards
us
had
prepared
everything
splendid
though
private
for
our
union
and
in
her
blissful
restored
possession
i
forgot
for
a
while
therese
and
her
agonies
but
when
my
dear
pembroke
first
saw
the
light
when
i
pressed
him
to
my
heart
it
seemed
as
if
in
the
same
instant
a
dagger
pierced
it
when
i
would
have
breathed
a
blessing
over
him
the
conviction
struck
me
that
i
durst
not
that
i
had
deluded
the
mother
who
gave
him
birth
and
that
at
some
future
period
he
might
have
cause
to
curse
the
author
of
his
existence
well
continued
the
baronet
wiping
his
forehead
though
the
birth
of
this
boy
conjured
up
the
image
of
your
mother
to
haunt
me
day
and
night
i
never
could
summon
moral
courage
to
inquire
of
her
destiny
after
i
had
left
her
when
the
troubles
of
poland
commenced
what
a
dreadful
terror
seized
me
the
successes
of
their
allied
enemies
and
the
consequent
distress
and
persecution
of
the
chief
nobility
overwhelmed
me
with
apprehension
i
knew
not
but
that
many
like
the
of
france
might
be
forced
to
abandon
their
country
and
the
bare
idea
of
meeting
your
grandfather
or
the
injured
therese
in
england
precipitated
me
into
a
nervous
state
that
menaced
my
life
i
became
abstracted
and
seriously
ill
was
forbidden
all
excitements
hence
easily
avoided
the
sight
of
newspapers
and
on
the
plea
you
have
heard
my
family
were
withheld
from
speaking
on
any
public
subjects
that
manifestly
gave
me
pain
but
i
could
not
prevent
the
tongues
of
our
visitors
from
discoursing
on
a
theme
which
at
that
period
interested
every
thinking
mind
i
heard
of
the
valiant
kosciusko
the
good
stanislaus
and
the
palatine
sobieski
with
his
brave
grandson
spoken
of
in
the
same
breath
i
durst
not
surmise
who
this
grandson
was
i
dared
not
ask
i
dreaded
to
know
at
length
added
the
agitated
father
quickening
his
voice
the
idol
of
my
heart
she
for
whom
i
had
sacrificed
my
all
of
human
probity
perhaps
my
soul
eternal
peace
died
in
my
arms
where
could
a
wretch
like
me
turn
for
consolation
i
had
forfeited
all
right
to
it
from
heaven
or
earth
but
at
last
a
benignant
spirit
seemed
to
breathe
on
me
and
i
bent
beneath
the
stroke
with
humility
for
i
embraced
it
as
the
just
chastisement
of
a
crime
which
till
then
even
in
the
midst
of
my
married
felicity
had
often
pressed
on
my
dearest
feelings
like
the
hand
of
death
i
repeat
i
bore
this
chastening
trial
with
the
resignation
i
have
described
but
when
two
years
afterwards
my
eye
fell
by
accident
upon
the
name
of
sobieski
in
one
of
the
public
papers
i
could
not
withdraw
it
my
sight
was
fascinated
as
if
by
a
in
one
column
i
read
how
bravely
the
palatine
fell
and
in
the
next
the
dreadful
fate
of
his
daughter
she
was
revenged
cried
sir
robert
eagerly
grasping
the
hand
of
thaddeus
who
could
not
restrain
the
groan
that
burst
from
his
breast
for
nearly
three
months
i
was
deprived
of
that
reason
which
had
abused
her
noble
nature
when
i
recovered
my
senes
continued
he
in
a
calmer
tone
and
found
i
had
so
fatally
suffered
the
time
of
any
restitution
to
her
to
go
by
i
began
to
torture
my
remorseful
heart
because
that
i
had
not
immediately
on
the
death
of
my
too
much
loved
edith
hastened
to
poland
and
besought
therese
pardon
from
her
heart
but
this
vivid
approach
to
a
sincere
repentance
was
soon
obliterated
by
the
consideration
that
the
countess
sobieski
having
had
a
prior
claim
to
my
name
such
restitution
on
my
part
must
have
illegitimatized
my
darling
pembroke
his
dying
mother
fondest
bequeathment
to
a
father
arms
it
was
this
fearful
conviction
exclaimed
sir
robert
a
sudden
horror
indeed
distracting
his
before
affectionate
eye
that
caused
all
my
barbarian
cruelty
when
my
dear
and
only
son
described
the
danger
from
which
you
had
rescued
him
when
he
told
me
that
therese
had
fostered
him
with
a
parent
tenderness
i
was
probed
to
the
heart
but
when
he
added
that
the
young
count
sobieski
was
now
an
alien
from
his
country
and
relying
on
my
friendship
for
a
home
my
terror
was
too
truly
manifested
horror
drove
all
natural
remorse
from
my
soul
i
thought
an
avenging
power
had
sent
my
deserted
child
to
discover
his
father
to
claim
his
rights
and
to
publish
me
as
a
disgrace
to
the
name
i
had
stolen
from
him
and
when
i
saw
my
innocent
pembroke
even
to
his
knees
petitioning
for
the
man
who
i
believed
had
come
to
undo
him
i
became
almost
deranged
may
the
lord
of
mercy
pardon
the
fury
of
that
derangement
for
under
that
temper
added
he
putting
the
trembling
hand
of
thaddeus
to
his
streaming
eyes
i
drove
my
to
be
a
wanderer
on
the
face
of
the
earth
not
for
his
own
crimes
but
for
those
of
his
father
and
heaven
justly
punished
in
the
crime
the
sin
of
my
injustice
when
i
thought
that
evidence
of
my
shame
was
divided
from
me
by
an
insuperable
barrier
when
i
believed
that
the
ocean
would
soon
separate
me
from
my
fears
a
righteous
providence
brought
thee
before
me
forlorn
and
expiring
it
was
the
son
of
therese
sobieski
i
had
exposed
to
such
wretchedness
it
was
the
cherished
of
her
heart
i
had
delivered
to
the
raging
elements
oh
thaddeus
my
son
cried
he
can
i
be
forgiven
for
all
this
in
this
world
or
in
the
next
oh
my
father
returned
thaddeus
with
a
modest
but
a
pathetic
energy
i
am
thy
son
thy
happy
son
in
such
acknowledgment
therefore
no
longer
upbraid
yourself
did
you
not
act
as
by
a
sacred
impulse
a
father
part
to
me
when
you
knew
me
not
you
raised
my
dying
head
from
the
earth
and
laid
it
on
your
bosom
o
my
father
he
who
brought
us
so
together
in
his
own
appointed
time
chasteneth
every
son
whom
he
receiveth
and
has
thus
proved
his
love
and
pardon
to
your
contrite
heart
both
on
earth
and
in
heaven
by
the
nature
of
your
chastisement
and
the
healing
balm
at
its
close
at
the
end
of
this
interview
so
interesting
and
vital
to
the
happiness
of
both
these
parties
father
and
son
sir
robert
motioned
his
blessing
to
that
son
by
laying
his
hand
gently
on
his
head
while
the
parental
tears
flowed
on
that
now
dear
forehead
for
he
could
not
then
speak
he
immediately
withdrew
to
leave
thaddeus
to
repose
and
himself
to
retire
to
pour
out
his
grateful
spirit
in
private
chapter
xlvi
the
spirit
of
peace
at
dawn
on
the
morning
following
the
preceding
eventful
but
happy
conference
sir
robert
painfully
remembering
the
frantic
grief
of
pembroke
on
finding
that
sobieski
had
not
only
withdrawn
himself
from
harrowby
but
had
adjured
england
forever
and
still
feeling
the
merited
bitterness
of
the
reproaches
which
his
inexplicable
commands
dishonoring
to
his
son
had
provoked
from
that
only
preferred
offspring
of
his
idolized
which
reproaches
unknowingly
so
inflicted
by
the
desperation
of
their
utterer
had
driven
the
guilty
father
to
seek
a
temporary
refuge
from
them
if
not
from
his
own
accusing
conscience
under
the
then
solitary
roof
of
one
of
his
country
seats
in
the
adjacent
county
yet
somewhat
relieved
as
by
the
immediate
mercy
of
heaven
from
the
load
of
his
misery
he
eagerly
wrote
by
the
auspicious
beams
of
the
rising
sun
a
few
short
lines
to
pembroke
telling
him
that
a
providential
circumstance
had
occurred
since
they
parted
which
he
trusted
would
finally
reconcile
into
a
perfect
peace
all
that
had
recently
passed
so
distressingly
between
them
therefore
he
his
ever
father
requested
him
to
join
him
alone
and
without
delay
at
deerhurst
this
duty
done
to
one
beloved
child
he
then
turned
to
anticipate
a
second
converse
to
his
comfort
with
the
other
that
sickness
which
is
the
consequence
of
mental
suffering
usually
vanishes
with
its
cause
long
before
the
of
this
happy
day
thaddeus
refreshed
by
the
peaceful
and
lengthened
sleep
from
which
he
awoke
late
in
the
morning
rose
as
if
with
a
renewed
principle
of
life
quitting
his
room
he
met
his
glad
father
in
the
who
instantly
conducted
him
into
a
private
room
where
that
now
tranquillized
parent
soon
brought
him
to
relate
with
every
sentence
a
deepening
interest
the
rapid
incidents
of
his
brief
but
eventful
career
the
voice
of
fame
had
already
blazoned
him
abroad
as
the
plume
of
war
with
early
laurels
crowned
but
it
was
left
to
his
own
ingenuous
tongue
to
prove
in
all
the
modest
simplicity
of
a
perfect
filial
confidence
that
the
most
difficult
conflicts
are
not
those
which
are
sustained
on
the
sir
robert
listened
to
him
with
affection
admiration
and
delight
ah
with
what
pride
in
such
a
son
he
was
answering
the
heartfelt
detail
with
respondent
gratefulness
to
that
almighty
power
which
had
shed
on
his
transgressing
head
such
signal
signs
of
heavenly
amnesty
when
the
door
opened
and
a
servant
announced
that
somerset
was
in
the
library
thaddeus
started
up
with
joy
in
his
countenance
but
sir
robert
gently
put
him
down
again
remain
here
my
son
said
he
until
i
apprize
your
brother
how
nearly
you
are
related
to
him
yonder
door
leads
into
my
study
i
will
call
you
when
he
is
prepared
the
moment
sir
robert
joined
pembroke
he
read
in
his
pale
and
haggard
features
how
much
he
needed
the
intelligence
he
was
summoned
to
hear
somerset
bowed
coldly
but
respectfully
on
his
entrance
and
begged
to
be
honored
with
his
commands
they
are
what
i
expect
will
restore
to
you
your
usual
looks
and
manner
my
dear
son
returned
the
baronet
so
attend
to
me
pembroke
listened
to
his
father
narrative
with
mute
and
as
it
proceeded
amazed
attention
but
when
the
name
of
therese
sobieski
was
mentioned
as
that
of
the
foreign
lady
whom
he
had
married
and
deserted
the
ready
apprehension
of
his
breathless
auditor
conceiving
the
remainder
yet
unuttered
by
the
agitated
narrator
sir
robert
had
only
to
confirm
though
in
a
hardly
audible
voice
the
eager
demand
of
his
son
was
thaddeus
sobieski
indeed
his
brother
and
while
hearing
the
reply
unable
to
ask
another
question
he
looked
wildly
from
earth
to
heaven
as
if
seeking
where
he
might
yet
be
found
o
my
father
cried
he
what
have
you
done
where
is
he
for
what
have
you
sacrificed
him
hear
me
to
an
end
rejoined
the
baronet
he
then
in
as
few
words
as
possible
repeated
the
subsequent
events
of
the
recent
meeting
pembroke
raptures
were
now
as
high
as
his
despair
had
been
profound
he
threw
himself
on
his
father
breast
he
asked
for
his
friend
his
brother
and
begged
to
be
conducted
to
him
sir
robert
did
no
more
than
open
the
intervening
door
and
in
one
instant
the
brothers
were
locked
in
each
other
arms
the
transports
of
the
young
men
for
a
long
while
denied
them
words
but
their
eyes
their
tears
and
their
united
hands
imparted
to
each
breast
a
consciousness
of
mutual
love
unutterable
not
even
to
be
expressed
by
those
looks
which
are
indeed
the
heralds
of
the
soul
sir
robert
wept
like
an
infant
whilst
contemplating
these
two
affectionate
brothers
in
a
faltering
voice
he
exclaimed
how
soon
may
these
plighted
hands
be
separated
by
inexorable
law
alas
pembroke
you
can
not
be
ignorant
that
i
buy
this
son
at
a
terrible
price
from
you
at
this
speech
the
blood
rushed
over
the
cheek
of
the
ingenuous
pembroke
but
thaddeus
turning
instantly
to
sir
robert
said
with
an
eloquent
smile
on
this
head
i
trust
that
neither
my
father
nor
my
brother
will
entertain
one
thought
to
trouble
them
had
i
even
the
inclination
to
act
otherwise
than
right
my
revered
grandfather
has
put
it
out
of
my
power
to
claim
or
to
bear
any
other
name
than
that
of
sobieski
he
made
me
swear
never
to
change
it
and
as
i
hope
to
meet
him
hereafter
added
he
with
solemnity
i
will
obey
him
therefore
my
beloved
father
in
secret
only
can
i
enjoy
the
conviction
that
i
am
your
son
and
pembroke
brother
yet
the
happiness
i
receive
with
the
knowledge
of
being
so
will
ever
live
here
will
ever
animate
my
heart
with
gratitude
to
heaven
and
to
you
noble
son
of
the
sainted
therese
cried
sir
robert
i
do
not
deserve
thee
how
shall
i
merit
your
care
of
my
honor
of
my
dearest
feelings
exclaimed
pembroke
grasping
the
hand
of
his
brother
i
can
do
nothing
dearest
thaddeus
i
am
a
bankrupt
in
the
means
of
evincing
what
is
passing
in
my
soul
my
mother
chaste
spirit
thanks
you
from
my
lips
yet
i
will
not
abuse
your
generosity
though
i
retain
the
name
of
somerset
it
shall
only
be
the
name
the
inheritance
entailed
on
my
father
eldest
son
belongs
to
you
whilst
thaddeus
embraced
his
brother
again
he
calmly
and
affectionately
replied
that
he
would
rather
encounter
all
the
probable
evils
from
which
his
father
benevolence
had
saved
him
than
rob
his
brother
of
any
part
of
that
inheritance
which
he
earnestly
added
i
sincerely
believe
according
to
the
providence
of
heaven
is
your
just
due
sir
robert
with
abhorrence
of
himself
and
admiration
of
his
sons
attempted
to
stop
this
noble
contention
by
proposing
that
it
should
be
determined
by
an
equal
division
of
the
family
property
not
so
my
father
returned
thaddeus
steadfastly
but
with
reverence
i
can
never
admit
that
the
title
of
somerset
should
sacrifice
one
jot
of
its
inherited
accustomed
munificence
by
making
any
such
alienation
of
its
means
and
then
the
ingenuous
son
of
therese
sobieski
proceeded
in
the
same
modest
but
firm
tone
to
remind
his
father
that
though
the
laws
of
the
national
church
wherein
he
had
married
her
would
have
given
their
son
every
right
over
any
inheritance
from
either
parent
which
belonged
to
poland
yet
as
no
opportunity
had
subsequently
occurred
for
repeating
the
sacred
ceremony
by
the
laws
of
his
father
church
her
son
could
make
no
legal
claim
whatever
on
a
rood
of
the
somerset
lands
in
england
sir
robert
with
unspeakable
emotion
clasped
the
hand
of
his
born
when
he
had
made
and
with
such
tender
delicacy
this
conclusive
remark
and
which
indeed
had
never
presented
itself
to
his
often
distractedly
apprehensive
mind
either
before
or
after
the
death
of
pembroke
mother
even
had
it
done
so
it
would
not
have
afforded
any
quiet
to
his
soul
from
the
internal
worm
gnawing
there
his
act
had
been
guilt
towards
therese
sobieski
and
her
confiding
innocence
and
it
was
not
the
discovery
of
any
omitted
legislative
ordinance
that
could
have
satisfied
the
accusing
conscience
in
his
own
bosom
hourly
calling
out
against
him
but
the
son
of
that
profaned
marriage
had
found
the
reconciling
point
had
poured
in
the
healing
balm
and
the
spirit
of
his
father
was
now
at
peace
in
cordial
harmony
therefore
with
this
generous
opinion
so
opportunely
expressed
by
the
sincere
judgment
of
the
last
of
the
house
of
sobieski
when
so
united
to
that
of
somerset
and
with
a
corresponding
simplicity
of
purpose
interwoven
by
the
sweet
reciprocity
of
mutual
confidence
the
remainder
of
the
evening
passed
pleasantly
between
the
happy
father
and
his
no
less
happy
sons
sir
robert
dispatched
a
letter
next
day
to
his
sister
to
invite
her
and
his
beloved
mary
to
join
the
home
party
at
deerhurst
without
delay
pembroke
rejoiced
in
this
prospective
relief
to
the
minds
of
his
aunt
and
cousin
being
well
aware
that
he
had
left
them
in
a
state
of
intense
anxiety
not
only
on
account
of
the
strange
conduct
which
had
not
been
explicable
in
any
way
to
their
alarmed
observations
but
on
account
of
himself
whose
mind
had
appeared
from
the
time
of
his
father
incensed
departure
in
a
state
verging
on
derangement
on
the
instant
of
his
return
from
the
deserted
hotel
while
passing
mary
whom
he
accidently
met
in
his
bewildered
way
to
sir
robert
room
he
had
exclaimed
to
her
i
have
not
seen
sobieski
he
is
gone
and
your
message
is
not
delivered
from
the
time
of
that
harrowing
intimation
he
had
constantly
avoided
even
the
sight
of
his
cousin
or
his
aunt
yet
before
he
quitted
the
castle
to
obey
his
father
new
commands
he
had
summoned
courage
to
enter
mary
boudoir
where
she
sat
alone
not
trusting
himself
to
speak
he
put
the
letter
which
thaddeus
had
written
to
her
into
her
hand
and
disappeared
not
daring
to
await
her
opening
what
he
knew
to
be
a
last
farewell
he
had
guessed
aright
for
from
the
moment
in
which
her
trembling
hand
had
broken
the
seal
and
she
had
read
it
to
the
end
bathed
in
her
tears
it
lay
on
her
mourning
heart
whether
she
waked
or
slept
till
her
silent
grief
was
roused
to
share
her
thoughts
with
a
personal
exertion
welcome
to
that
despondent
heart
it
was
sir
robert
invitation
for
her
own
and
her
aunt
immediate
removal
to
their
always
favorite
deerhurst
because
far
from
the
gay
world
and
ever
devoted
to
quite
domestic
enjoyments
but
before
this
summons
had
arrived
and
early
in
the
morning
of
the
same
day
lady
albina
stanhope
more
dead
than
alive
in
appearance
had
reached
somerset
castle
in
a
accompanied
by
her
maid
alone
to
implore
the
protection
of
its
revered
owner
against
the
most
terrible
evils
that
could
be
inflicted
by
an
unnatural
parent
on
a
daughter
heart
that
of
being
compelled
to
be
a
party
in
a
double
outrage
on
the
memory
of
her
mother
by
witnessing
the
marriage
of
her
father
by
special
license
to
lady
olivia
lovel
that
very
evening
in
the
harwold
great
hall
and
herself
to
commit
the
monstrous
act
of
being
married
to
a
nephew
of
that
profligate
woman
to
avoid
such
horrors
she
had
flown
for
refuge
to
the
only
persons
she
knew
on
earth
likely
to
shield
her
from
so
great
an
infamy
soon
after
this
disclosure
to
which
the
sister
and
niece
of
the
beneficent
sir
robert
somerset
whom
she
had
hoped
to
find
at
the
castle
had
listened
with
the
tenderest
sympathy
his
letter
to
miss
dorothy
was
delivered
to
the
venerable
lady
mary
and
their
fatigued
guest
were
seated
together
on
the
sofa
and
the
seal
without
apology
from
the
receiver
anxious
haste
to
learn
what
it
might
contain
of
her
brother
health
was
instantly
broken
a
glance
removed
every
care
reading
it
aloud
to
both
her
young
auditors
at
every
welcome
word
the
bosom
of
the
amazed
miss
beaufort
heaved
with
increasing
astonishment
hope
and
gratitude
while
beneath
the
veil
of
her
clustered
ringlets
her
eyes
shed
the
tribute
of
happy
tears
to
heaven
to
that
heaven
alone
her
virgin
spirit
breathed
the
emotions
of
her
reviving
heart
the
good
old
lady
was
not
backward
in
demonstrating
her
wonderings
surprised
at
her
brother
rencontre
with
thaddeus
but
more
at
his
avowal
of
obligations
to
any
of
that
nation
about
which
he
had
always
proclaimed
an
aversion
she
was
so
wrapped
in
bewilderment
yet
delight
at
the
discovery
that
her
ever
cheerful
tongue
felt
nothing
loathe
to
impart
to
the
listening
albina
who
had
recognized
in
the
names
of
constantine
and
thaddeus
those
of
her
lamented
mother
most
faithful
friend
all
that
she
knew
of
his
public
as
well
as
his
private
character
since
she
had
known
him
by
that
of
sobieski
also
sir
robert
letter
informed
his
sister
that
a
providential
circumstance
had
introduced
pembroke
friend
the
count
sobieski
to
his
presence
when
to
his
astonishment
and
unutterable
satisfaction
he
discovered
that
this
celebrated
young
hero
though
one
of
a
nation
against
which
he
had
so
often
declared
his
dislike
but
which
ungenerous
prejudice
he
now
abjured
was
the
only
remaining
branch
of
a
family
from
whom
about
years
ago
while
in
a
country
far
distant
equally
from
england
or
poland
he
had
received
many
kindnesses
he
had
contracted
an
immense
debt
under
peculiarly
embarrassing
circumstances
to
himself
when
then
an
alien
from
his
father
confidence
and
his
benefactor
in
this
otherwise
inextricable
dilemma
was
the
palatine
of
masovia
the
grandfather
of
the
young
count
sobieski
and
he
added
in
some
small
compensation
for
the
pecuniary
part
of
this
latter
obligation
the
fulfilment
of
which
certain
adverse
events
on
the
continent
had
continued
to
prevent
he
had
besought
and
obtained
permission
from
the
young
count
now
in
england
to
at
once
set
at
rest
his
past
anxieties
to
settle
an
affair
of
so
much
importance
by
signing
over
to
him
as
the
palatine
heir
and
representative
the
sole
property
of
his
sir
robert
new
domain
the
house
and
estates
of
manor
court
nearly
adjoining
to
those
of
dcerhurst
on
the
warwick
side
the
might
be
about
live
thousand
pounds
per
annum
and
there
in
immediate
right
of
possession
the
noble
descendant
of
his
munificent
friend
would
resume
his
illustrious
name
and
embrace
with
a
generous
esteem
of
this
country
national
character
a
lasting
home
and
filiation
in
england
sir
robert
closed
this
auspicious
letter
which
he
had
striven
however
to
write
in
such
a
manner
as
not
to
betray
the
true
nature
of
the
parental
feelings
which
dictated
it
with
a
playful
expression
of
his
impatience
to
present
to
his
sister
and
niece
their
interesting
in
a
character
which
reflected
so
much
honor
on
their
discernment
the
impatience
was
indeed
shared
though
in
different
degrees
and
forms
by
the
whole
little
party
the
soul
of
one
in
it
totally
absorbed
but
owing
to
some
insurmountable
obstacles
occasioning
delays
by
the
exhausted
state
of
the
overwrought
lady
albina
and
notwithstanding
the
necessity
of
getting
on
as
fast
as
possible
to
be
out
of
the
reach
of
the
enraged
earl
should
he
have
missed
and
traced
his
daughter
to
somerset
castle
the
fugitives
could
not
start
till
late
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
and
it
was
an
hour
or
more
past
midnight
before
they
arrived
at
deerhurst
the
family
in
no
small
disappointment
had
given
them
up
for
the
night
and
had
retired
to
their
rooms
miss
dorothy
who
would
not
suffer
her
brother
to
be
disturbed
sent
the
two
young
ladies
to
their
chambers
and
was
crossing
on
tiptoe
the
long
to
her
own
apartment
when
a
door
opening
pembroke
in
his
gown
and
slippers
looked
out
on
hearing
the
stealthy
step
she
put
forth
her
hand
to
him
with
delight
and
in
a
low
voice
congratulated
him
on
the
change
in
sir
robert
mind
kissed
his
cheek
and
told
him
to
prepare
for
another
pleasant
surprise
in
the
morning
smiling
with
these
words
she
bade
him
and
softly
proceeded
to
her
chamber
pembroke
had
thought
so
little
of
his
aunt
lively
promise
that
she
saw
him
one
of
the
latest
in
entering
the
he
not
having
hastened
from
his
usual
breezy
early
walk
over
the
neighboring
downs
where
thaddeus
had
been
his
companion
miss
dorothy
gayly
reproached
her
nephew
for
his
undutiful
lack
of
curiosity
while
mary
with
a
glowing
cheek
received
the
glad
embrace
of
her
cousin
who
gently
whispered
to
her
now
i
shall
see
together
the
two
beings
i
most
dearly
love
oh
the
happiness
contained
in
that
sight
mary
vivid
blush
had
not
subsided
when
the
entrance
of
thaddeus
and
his
agitated
bow
overspread
her
neck
and
brow
with
crimson
a
sudden
dimness
obscured
her
faculties
and
she
scarcely
heard
the
animated
words
of
sir
robert
whilst
presenting
him
to
her
as
the
count
sobieski
the
beloved
grandson
of
one
who
had
deserved
the
warmest
place
in
his
heart
whatever
he
was
the
lowly
constantine
or
the
distinguished
sobieski
she
was
conscious
that
he
was
lord
of
hers
and
withdrawing
her
hand
confusedly
from
the
timid
and
thrilling
touch
of
him
she
would
have
willingly
lingered
near
forever
she
glided
towards
an
open
casement
where
the
fresh
air
helped
to
dispel
the
faintness
which
had
seized
her
after
miss
dorothy
with
all
the
urbanity
of
her
nature
had
declared
her
welcome
to
the
count
she
put
away
the
coffee
that
was
handed
to
her
by
pembroke
and
said
with
a
smile
before
i
taste
my
breakfast
i
must
inform
you
sir
robert
that
you
have
a
guest
in
this
house
you
little
expect
i
forbade
miss
beaufort
saying
a
word
because
as
we
are
told
first
tellers
of
unwelcome
news
have
but
a
losing
office
i
hoped
for
a
gaining
one
therefore
preserved
such
a
profitable
piece
of
intelligence
for
my
own
promulgation
indeed
i
doubt
whether
it
will
not
win
me
a
pair
of
gloves
from
some
folks
here
added
she
glancing
archly
on
pembroke
who
looked
round
at
this
whimsical
declaration
suffice
it
to
say
that
yesterday
morning
lady
albina
stanhope
looking
like
a
ghost
and
her
poor
maid
scared
almost
out
of
her
wits
arrived
in
a
at
somerset
castle
and
besought
our
protection
our
dear
mary
embraced
the
weeping
young
creature
who
amidst
many
tears
recapitulated
the
injuries
she
had
suffered
since
she
had
been
torn
from
her
mother
remains
at
the
abbey
the
latest
outrage
of
her
cruel
father
was
his
intended
immediate
marriage
with
the
vile
lady
olivia
lovel
and
his
commands
that
lady
albina
should
the
same
evening
give
her
hand
to
that
bad
woman
nephew
ill
as
she
was
when
she
received
these
disgraceful
orders
she
determined
to
prevent
the
horror
of
such
double
degradation
by
instantly
quitting
the
house
added
she
could
i
go
ah
i
could
think
of
none
so
likely
to
pity
the
unhappy
victim
of
the
wickedness
i
fled
from
as
the
father
of
the
kind
somerset
he
had
told
me
we
were
relations
i
beseech
you
kind
ladies
to
be
my
friends
certain
of
your
benevolence
my
dear
brother
continued
miss
dorothy
i
stopped
this
sweet
girl
petition
with
my
caresses
and
promised
her
a
gentler
father
in
sir
robert
somerset
you
did
right
dorothy
returned
the
baronet
though
the
earl
and
i
must
ever
be
strangers
i
have
no
enmity
to
his
children
where
is
this
young
lady
miss
dorothy
informed
him
that
in
consequence
of
her
recent
grief
and
ill
treatment
she
had
found
herself
too
unwell
to
rise
with
the
family
but
she
hoped
to
join
them
at
noon
pembroke
was
indeed
deeply
interested
in
this
intelligence
the
simple
graces
of
the
lovely
albina
had
on
the
first
interview
touched
his
heart
her
sufferings
at
harrowby
and
the
sensibility
which
her
ingenuous
nature
exhibited
without
affectation
or
disguise
had
left
her
image
on
his
mind
long
after
they
parted
he
now
gave
the
reins
to
his
eager
imagination
and
was
the
first
in
the
saloon
to
greet
her
as
his
lovely
sir
robert
somerset
welcomed
her
with
the
warmth
of
a
parent
and
the
amiable
girl
wept
in
happy
gratitude
during
this
scene
miss
beaufort
no
longer
able
to
bear
the
restraint
of
company
nor
even
the
accidental
encountering
of
his
eyes
whose
presence
dear
as
it
was
oppressed
and
disconcerted
her
walked
out
into
the
park
though
it
was
the
latter
end
of
october
the
weather
continued
fine
a
bright
sun
tempered
the
air
and
gilded
the
yellow
leaves
which
the
fresh
wind
drove
before
her
into
a
thousand
glittering
eddies
this
was
mary
favorite
season
she
ever
found
its
solemnity
infuse
a
sacred
tenderness
into
her
soul
the
rugged
form
of
care
seemed
to
dissolve
under
the
magic
touch
of
sweet
nature
forgetful
of
the
world
anxieties
she
felt
the
tranquillizing
spirit
of
soothing
melancholy
that
shades
the
heart
of
sorrow
with
a
veil
which
might
well
be
called
the
twilight
of
the
mind
and
the
entranced
soul
happy
in
its
dream
half
closes
its
bright
eye
reluctant
to
perceive
that
such
bland
repose
is
pillowed
on
the
shifting
clouds
such
were
the
reflections
of
miss
beaufort
after
her
disturbed
thoughts
had
tossed
themselves
in
a
sea
of
doubts
regarding
any
possible
interest
she
might
possess
in
the
breast
of
sobieski
she
recalled
the
hours
they
had
passed
together
they
agitated
but
did
not
satisfy
her
heart
she
remembered
pembroke
vehement
declaration
that
thaddeus
loved
her
but
then
it
was
pembroke
declaration
not
his
and
the
circumstances
in
which
it
had
been
made
were
too
likely
to
mislead
the
wishes
of
her
cousin
and
then
sobieski
farewell
letter
it
was
noble
grateful
but
where
appeared
the
glowing
pervading
sentiment
that
consumed
her
life
for
him
exhausted
by
the
anguish
of
this
suspense
she
resolved
to
resign
her
future
fate
to
providence
turning
her
gaze
on
the
lovely
objects
around
she
soon
found
the
genius
of
the
season
absorb
her
wholly
her
cheeks
glowed
her
eyes
became
humid
and
casting
their
mild
radiance
on
the
fading
flowers
beneath
she
pursued
her
way
through
a
cloud
of
fragrance
it
was
the
last
breath
of
the
expiring
year
love
is
full
of
imagination
mary
easily
glided
from
the
earth
departing
charms
to
her
own
she
thought
waning
beauty
the
chord
once
touched
every
note
vibrated
and
hope
and
fear
joy
and
regret
again
dispossessed
her
serenity
chapter
xlvii
an
avowal
after
some
little
time
lady
albina
having
missed
miss
beaufort
expressed
a
wish
to
walk
out
in
search
of
her
and
the
two
brothers
offered
their
attendance
but
before
her
ladyship
had
passed
through
the
first
park
she
complained
of
fatigue
pembroke
urged
her
to
enter
a
shepherd
hut
close
by
whilst
the
count
sobieski
would
proceed
alone
in
quest
of
his
cousin
with
a
beating
heart
thaddeus
undertook
this
commission
hastening
along
the
nearest
dell
with
the
lightness
of
a
young
hunter
he
mounted
the
heights
descended
to
the
glades
traversed
one
woody
nook
and
then
another
but
could
see
no
trace
of
miss
beaufort
supposing
she
had
returned
to
the
house
he
was
slackening
his
pace
to
abandon
the
search
when
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
figure
as
she
turned
the
corner
of
a
thicket
leading
to
a
terrace
above
in
an
instant
he
was
at
her
side
and
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
a
glowing
cheek
he
repeated
his
errand
mary
blushed
faltered
and
became
strangely
alarmed
at
finding
herself
alone
with
him
though
he
now
stood
before
her
in
a
quality
which
she
ever
believed
was
his
right
the
remembrance
of
what
had
passed
between
them
in
other
circumstances
confounded
and
overwhelmed
her
when
constantine
was
poor
and
unfriended
it
seemed
a
sacred
privilege
to
pity
and
to
love
him
when
the
same
constantine
appeared
as
a
man
of
rank
invested
with
a
splendid
fortune
and
extensive
fame
she
felt
lost
annihilated
the
cloud
which
had
obscured
not
extinguished
his
glory
was
dispersed
he
was
that
sobieski
whom
she
had
admired
unseen
he
was
that
constantine
whom
she
had
loved
unknown
he
was
that
sobieski
that
constantine
whom
seen
and
known
she
now
alas
loved
almost
to
adoration
oppressed
by
the
weight
of
these
emotions
she
only
bowed
to
what
he
said
and
gathering
her
cloak
from
the
winds
which
blew
it
around
her
was
hurrying
with
downward
eyes
to
the
stairs
of
the
terrace
when
her
foot
slipped
and
she
must
have
fallen
had
not
thaddeus
caught
her
in
his
ready
arm
she
rose
with
a
blushing
face
and
the
color
did
not
recede
when
she
found
that
he
had
not
relinquished
her
hand
her
heart
beat
violently
her
head
became
giddy
her
feet
lost
their
power
finding
that
after
a
slight
attempt
to
withdraw
her
hand
he
still
held
it
fast
though
in
a
trembling
grasp
and
nearly
overcome
by
inexplicable
distress
she
turned
away
her
face
to
conceal
its
confusion
thaddeus
saw
all
this
and
with
a
fluttering
hope
instead
of
surrendering
the
hand
he
had
retained
he
made
it
a
yet
closer
prisoner
by
clasping
it
in
both
his
pressing
it
earnestly
to
his
breast
he
said
in
a
hurried
voice
whilst
his
earnest
eyes
poured
all
their
beams
upon
her
averted
cheek
surely
miss
beaufort
will
not
deny
me
the
dearest
happiness
i
possess
the
privilege
of
being
grateful
to
her
he
paused
his
soul
was
too
full
for
utterance
and
raising
hand
from
his
heart
to
his
lips
he
kissed
it
fervently
almost
fainting
miss
beaufort
leaned
her
head
against
a
tree
of
the
thicket
where
they
were
standing
the
thought
of
the
confession
which
pembroke
had
extorted
from
her
and
dreading
that
its
fullness
might
have
been
imparted
to
him
and
that
all
this
was
rather
the
tribute
of
gratitude
than
of
love
she
waved
her
other
hand
in
sign
for
him
to
leave
her
such
extraordinary
confusion
in
her
manner
palsied
the
warm
and
blissful
emotions
of
the
count
he
too
began
to
blame
the
sanguine
representation
of
his
friend
and
fearing
that
he
had
offended
her
that
she
might
suppose
he
presumed
on
her
kindness
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
silent
astonishment
then
dropping
on
his
knee
hardly
conscious
of
the
action
declared
in
an
agitated
voice
his
sense
of
having
given
this
offence
at
the
same
time
he
ventured
to
repeat
with
equally
modest
energy
the
passion
he
had
so
long
endeavored
to
seal
up
in
his
lonely
breast
but
forgive
me
added
he
with
increased
earnestness
forgive
me
in
justice
to
your
own
virtues
in
what
has
just
passed
i
feel
i
ought
to
have
only
expressed
thanks
for
your
goodness
to
an
unfortunate
exile
but
if
my
words
or
manner
have
obeyed
the
more
fervid
impulse
of
my
soul
and
declared
aloud
what
is
its
glory
in
secret
blame
my
nature
most
respected
miss
beaufort
not
my
presumption
i
have
not
dared
to
look
steadily
on
any
aim
higher
than
your
esteem
mary
knew
not
how
to
receive
this
address
the
position
in
which
he
uttered
it
his
countenance
when
she
turned
to
answer
him
were
both
demonstrative
of
something
less
equivocal
than
his
speech
he
was
still
grasping
the
drapery
of
her
cloak
and
his
eyes
from
which
the
wind
blew
back
his
fine
hair
were
beaming
upon
her
full
of
that
piercing
tenderness
which
at
once
dissolves
and
assures
the
soul
she
passed
her
hand
over
her
eyes
her
soul
was
in
a
tumult
she
too
fondly
wished
to
believe
that
he
loved
her
to
trust
the
evidence
of
what
she
saw
his
words
were
ambiguous
and
that
was
sufficient
to
fill
her
with
uncertainty
jealous
of
that
delicacy
which
is
the
parent
of
love
and
its
best
preserver
she
checked
the
of
her
heart
and
whilst
her
concealed
face
streamed
with
tears
conjured
him
to
rise
instinctively
she
held
out
her
hand
to
assist
him
he
obeyed
and
hardly
conscious
of
what
she
said
she
continued
you
have
done
nothing
count
sobieski
to
offend
me
i
was
fearful
of
my
own
conduct
that
you
might
have
supposed
i
mean
unfortunate
appearances
might
lead
you
to
imagine
that
i
was
influenced
was
so
forgetful
of
myself
cease
madam
cease
for
pity
sake
cried
thaddeus
starting
back
and
dropping
her
hand
every
motion
which
faltered
on
her
tongue
had
met
an
answering
pang
in
his
breast
fearing
that
he
had
set
his
heart
on
the
possession
of
a
treasure
totally
out
of
his
reach
he
knew
not
how
high
had
been
his
hope
until
he
felt
the
depth
of
his
despair
taking
up
his
hat
which
lay
on
the
grass
with
a
countenance
from
which
every
gleam
of
joy
was
banished
he
bowed
respectfully
and
in
a
lower
tone
continued
the
dependent
situation
in
which
i
appeared
at
lady
dundas
being
ever
before
my
eyes
i
was
not
so
absurd
as
to
suppose
that
any
lady
could
then
notice
me
from
any
other
sentiment
than
humanity
that
i
excited
this
humanity
where
alone
i
was
proud
to
awaken
it
was
in
these
hours
of
dejection
my
sole
comfort
it
consoled
me
for
the
friends
i
had
lost
it
repaid
me
for
the
honors
which
were
no
more
but
that
is
past
seeing
no
further
cause
for
compassion
you
deem
the
delusion
no
longer
necessary
since
you
will
not
allow
me
an
individual
distinction
in
having
attracted
your
benevolence
though
i
am
to
ascribe
it
all
to
a
charity
as
diffused
as
effective
yet
i
must
ever
acknowledge
with
the
deepest
gratitude
that
i
owe
my
present
home
and
happiness
to
miss
beaufort
further
than
this
i
shall
not
i
dare
not
presume
these
words
shifted
all
the
count
anguish
to
mary
breast
she
perceived
the
offended
delicacy
which
actuated
each
syllable
as
it
fell
and
fearful
of
having
lost
everything
by
her
cold
and
what
might
appear
haughty
reply
she
opened
her
lips
to
say
what
might
better
explain
her
meaning
but
her
heart
failing
her
she
closed
them
again
and
continued
to
walk
in
silence
by
his
side
having
allowed
the
opportunity
to
escape
she
believed
that
all
hopes
of
exculpation
were
at
an
end
not
daring
to
look
up
she
cast
a
despairing
glance
at
sobieski
graceful
figure
as
he
walked
equally
silent
near
her
his
arms
were
folded
his
hat
pulled
over
his
forehead
and
his
long
dark
eyelashes
shading
his
downward
eyes
imparted
a
dejection
to
his
whole
air
which
wrapped
her
weeping
heart
round
and
round
with
regretful
pangs
ah
thought
she
though
the
offspring
of
but
one
moment
they
will
prey
on
my
peace
forever
at
the
turning
of
a
little
wooded
knoll
the
mute
and
pensive
pair
heard
the
sound
of
some
one
on
the
other
side
approaching
them
through
the
dry
leaves
in
a
minute
after
sir
robert
somerset
appeared
whilst
his
father
advanced
smiling
towards
him
thaddeus
attempted
to
dispel
the
gloom
of
his
countenance
but
not
succeeding
he
bowed
abruptly
to
the
agitated
mary
and
hastily
said
i
will
leave
miss
beaufort
in
your
protection
sir
and
go
myself
to
see
whether
lady
albina
be
recovered
from
her
fatigue
i
thought
to
find
you
all
together
returned
sir
robert
where
is
her
ladyship
i
left
her
with
pembroke
in
a
hut
by
the
river
said
thaddeus
and
bowing
again
he
hurried
away
whilst
his
father
called
after
him
to
return
in
a
few
minutes
and
accompany
him
in
a
walk
the
departure
of
sobieski
when
he
had
come
expressly
to
attend
her
to
lady
albina
nearly
overwhelmed
miss
beaufort
before
exhausted
spirits
hardly
knowing
whether
to
remain
or
retreat
she
was
attempting
the
latter
when
her
guardian
caught
her
hand
stay
mary
cried
he
you
surely
would
not
leave
me
alone
miss
beaufort
tears
had
gushed
over
her
eyes
the
moment
her
back
was
turned
and
as
sir
robert
drew
her
towards
him
to
his
extreme
amazement
he
saw
that
she
was
weeping
at
a
sight
so
unexpected
the
smile
of
hilarity
left
his
lips
putting
his
arm
tenderly
round
her
waist
for
now
that
her
distress
had
discovered
itself
her
emotion
became
so
great
that
she
could
hardly
stand
he
inquired
in
a
kindly
manner
what
had
affected
her
she
answered
by
sobs
only
until
finding
it
impossible
to
break
away
from
her
uncle
arms
she
hid
her
face
in
his
bosom
and
gave
vent
to
the
full
tide
of
her
tears
recollecting
the
strange
haste
in
which
thaddeus
had
hurried
from
them
and
remembering
miss
beaufort
generosity
to
him
in
town
followed
by
her
succeeding
melancholy
sir
robert
at
once
united
these
circumstances
with
her
present
confusion
and
conceiving
an
instantaneous
suspicion
of
the
reality
pressed
her
with
redoubled
affection
to
his
bosom
i
fear
my
dearest
girl
said
he
that
something
disagreeable
has
happened
between
you
and
the
count
sobieski
perhaps
he
has
offended
you
perhaps
he
has
found
my
sweet
mary
too
amiable
alarmed
at
this
supposition
after
a
short
struggle
she
answered
o
no
sir
it
is
i
who
have
offended
him
he
thinks
i
pride
myself
on
the
insignificant
services
i
rendered
to
him
in
london
this
reply
convinced
the
baronet
that
he
had
not
been
in
his
judgment
and
with
a
delight
springing
in
his
soul
he
inquired
why
she
thought
so
had
she
given
him
any
reason
to
believe
so
mary
trembled
at
saying
dreading
that
every
word
she
might
utter
would
betray
how
highly
she
prized
the
count
esteem
she
faltered
hesitated
stopped
sir
robert
put
the
question
a
second
time
in
different
terms
my
loved
mary
said
he
seating
her
by
him
on
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
i
am
sincerely
anxious
that
you
and
this
young
nobleman
should
regard
each
other
as
friends
he
is
very
dear
to
me
and
you
can
not
doubt
my
sweet
girl
my
affection
for
yourself
tell
me
therefore
the
cause
of
this
little
misunderstanding
miss
beaufort
took
courage
at
this
speech
drying
her
glowing
eyes
though
still
concealing
them
with
a
handkerchief
she
replied
in
a
firmer
voice
i
believe
sir
the
fault
lies
totally
on
my
side
the
count
sobieski
met
me
on
the
terrace
and
thanked
me
for
what
i
had
done
for
him
i
acted
very
weakly
i
was
confused
indeed
i
knew
not
what
he
said
but
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
i
became
so
disconcerted
so
frightened
at
the
idea
of
his
having
attributed
my
conduct
to
indelicacy
or
forwardness
that
i
answered
something
which
offended
him
and
i
am
sure
he
now
thinks
me
unfeeling
and
proud
sir
robert
kissed
her
throbbing
forehead
as
she
ended
this
rapid
and
explanation
tell
me
candidly
my
dearest
mary
rejoined
the
baronet
can
you
believe
that
a
man
of
sobieski
disposition
would
bend
his
knee
to
a
woman
whom
he
did
not
both
respect
and
love
simple
gratitude
my
dear
girl
is
not
so
earnest
you
have
said
enough
to
convince
me
whatever
may
be
your
sentiments
that
you
are
the
mistress
of
his
fate
and
if
he
should
mention
it
to
me
may
i
describe
to
him
the
scene
which
has
now
passed
between
us
may
i
tell
him
that
its
just
inference
would
requite
his
tenderness
with
more
than
your
thanks
and
best
wishes
miss
beaufort
who
believed
that
the
count
must
now
despise
her
looked
down
to
conceal
the
wretchedness
which
spoke
through
her
eyes
and
with
a
sigh
answered
i
will
not
deny
that
i
deeply
esteem
the
count
sobieski
i
admired
his
character
before
i
saw
him
and
when
i
did
see
him
although
ignorant
that
it
was
he
the
impression
seemed
the
same
yet
i
never
aspired
to
any
place
in
his
heart
or
even
his
remembrance
i
could
not
have
the
presumption
therefore
my
dear
uncle
added
she
laying
her
trembling
hand
on
his
arm
i
beseech
you
as
you
value
my
feelings
my
peace
of
mind
never
to
breathe
a
syllable
of
my
weakness
to
him
i
think
added
she
clasping
her
hands
with
energy
and
forgetting
the
force
of
her
expression
i
would
sooner
suffer
death
than
lose
his
respect
and
yet
inquired
sir
robert
you
will
at
some
future
period
give
your
hand
to
another
man
mary
who
did
not
consider
the
extent
of
this
insidious
question
answered
with
fervor
never
i
never
can
be
happier
than
i
am
added
she
with
breathless
haste
seeing
by
the
smile
on
sir
robert
lips
that
far
more
had
been
declared
by
her
manner
than
her
words
intended
and
fearful
of
betraying
herself
further
she
begged
permission
to
retire
to
the
house
the
baronet
took
her
hand
and
reseating
her
by
him
continued
no
my
mary
you
shall
not
leave
me
unless
you
honestly
avow
what
your
sentiments
are
towards
the
count
sobieski
you
know
my
sweet
girl
that
i
have
tried
to
make
you
regard
me
as
a
father
to
induce
you
to
receive
from
my
love
the
treble
affection
of
your
deceased
parents
and
my
lamented
wife
if
her
dear
niece
do
not
deny
this
she
can
not
treat
me
with
reserve
miss
beaufort
was
unable
to
speak
sir
robert
proceeded
i
will
not
overwhelm
your
shrinking
delicacy
by
repeating
the
inquiry
whether
i
have
mistaken
the
source
of
your
recent
and
present
emotion
only
allow
me
to
bestow
some
encouragement
on
the
attachment
should
he
claim
my
services
in
its
behalf
mary
drew
her
uncle
hand
to
her
lips
and
whilst
her
dropping
tears
fell
upon
it
she
threw
herself
like
a
confiding
child
on
her
knees
and
replied
in
a
timid
voice
i
should
be
a
monster
of
ingratitude
could
i
hide
anything
from
you
my
dearest
sir
after
this
goodness
i
confess
that
i
do
regard
the
count
sobieski
more
than
any
being
on
earth
who
could
see
and
know
him
and
think
it
possible
to
become
another
and
you
shall
be
his
my
darling
mary
cried
the
baronet
mingling
his
own
blissful
tears
with
hers
i
once
hoped
to
have
contrived
an
attachment
between
you
and
pembroke
but
heaven
has
decreed
it
better
when
you
and
thaddeus
are
united
i
shall
be
happy
i
may
then
die
in
peace
miss
beaufort
sighed
heavily
she
could
not
yet
quite
participate
in
her
uncle
rapture
she
thought
that
she
had
insulted
and
disgusted
the
count
by
her
late
behavior
beyond
his
excuse
and
was
opening
her
lips
to
urge
it
again
when
the
object
of
their
conversation
appeared
at
a
short
distance
coming
towards
them
full
of
renewed
trepidation
she
burst
from
the
baronet
hand
and
taking
to
flight
left
her
uncle
to
meet
sobieski
alone
sir
robert
anxious
question
on
the
same
subject
received
a
more
rapid
reply
from
thaddeus
than
had
proceeded
from
the
reluctant
miss
beaufort
the
animated
gratitude
of
sobieski
the
ardent
yet
respectful
manner
with
which
he
avowed
her
eminence
in
his
heart
above
all
other
women
convinced
the
baronet
that
mary
retreating
delicacy
had
misinformed
her
a
complete
explanation
was
the
consequence
and
thaddeus
who
had
not
been
more
sanguine
in
his
hopes
than
was
his
lovely
mistress
in
hers
now
allowed
the
clouds
over
his
so
lately
darkened
eyes
to
disappear
impatient
to
see
these
two
beings
so
dear
to
his
soul
repose
confidently
in
each
other
affection
the
moment
sir
robert
returned
to
the
house
he
asked
his
sister
for
miss
beaufort
miss
dorothy
replied
that
she
had
seen
her
about
half
an
hour
ago
retire
to
her
own
apartments
the
baronet
therefore
sent
a
servant
to
beg
that
she
would
meet
him
in
the
library
this
message
found
her
in
a
paroxysm
of
distress
she
reproached
herself
for
her
imprudence
her
temerity
her
unwomanly
conduct
in
having
given
away
her
heart
to
a
man
who
she
again
began
to
torment
herself
by
believing
had
never
desired
it
she
remembered
that
her
weakness
not
her
sincerity
had
betrayed
this
humiliating
secret
to
sir
robert
and
nearly
distracted
she
lay
on
the
bed
almost
hoping
that
she
was
in
a
miserable
dream
when
her
maid
entered
with
the
baronet
commands
disdaining
herself
and
determining
to
regain
some
portion
of
her
own
respect
by
steadily
opposing
all
her
uncle
deluding
hopes
with
an
assumed
serenity
she
arrived
at
the
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
lock
but
the
moment
it
yielded
to
her
touch
all
her
firmness
vanished
trembling
and
pale
as
death
she
appeared
before
him
sir
robert
having
supported
her
to
a
chair
with
the
most
affectionate
and
tender
expressions
of
paternal
exultation
repeated
to
her
the
sum
of
his
conversation
with
the
count
mary
was
almost
wild
at
this
discourse
so
inconsistent
and
erratic
is
the
passion
of
love
when
it
reigns
in
woman
breast
she
forgot
in
an
instant
the
looks
and
voice
of
thaddeus
she
forgot
her
terror
of
having
forfeited
his
affection
by
her
affected
coldness
alone
and
dreading
that
the
first
proposal
of
their
union
had
proceeded
from
her
uncle
she
buried
her
agitated
face
in
her
hands
and
exclaimed
o
sir
i
fear
that
you
have
made
me
forever
hateful
in
my
own
eyes
and
despicable
in
those
of
the
count
sobieski
sir
robert
looked
on
her
emotion
with
a
smiling
but
a
pitying
gaze
reading
in
all
the
unaffected
apprehensive
modesty
of
that
noble
maiden
heart
well
cried
he
in
a
gentle
raillery
of
tone
my
own
beloved
one
if
thy
guardian
uncle
can
not
prevail
over
this
wayward
fancifulness
so
unlike
his
ingenuous
mary
usual
fair
dealing
with
the
truth
of
others
i
must
call
in
even
a
pleader
and
shall
then
leave
my
object
the
balance
of
justice
and
mercy
in
equally
beloved
hands
while
he
spoke
he
rose
and
opened
a
door
that
led
to
an
adjoining
room
miss
beaufort
would
have
flown
through
another
had
not
sir
robert
suddenly
stood
in
her
way
he
threw
his
arm
about
her
and
turning
round
she
saw
the
count
who
had
entered
regarding
her
with
an
anxiety
which
covered
her
before
pale
features
with
blushes
his
father
bade
him
come
near
sobieski
obeyed
though
with
a
step
that
expressed
how
reluctant
he
was
to
oppress
the
woman
he
so
truly
loved
mary
face
was
now
hidden
in
her
uncle
bosom
sir
robert
put
her
trembling
hand
into
that
of
his
son
who
dropping
on
his
knee
said
in
an
agitated
voice
honored
dearest
miss
beaufort
may
i
indulge
myself
in
the
idea
that
i
am
blessed
with
your
regard
she
could
not
reply
but
whispered
to
her
uncle
pray
sir
desire
him
to
rise
i
am
overwhelmed
my
sweet
mary
returned
the
baronet
pressing
her
to
his
breast
this
is
no
time
for
deception
on
either
side
i
know
both
your
hearts
rise
thaddeus
said
he
to
the
count
whilst
he
locked
both
their
hands
within
his
take
him
mary
receive
from
your
guardian
his
most
precious
gift
my
matchless
and
injured
son
the
abruptness
of
the
first
part
of
this
speech
might
have
shocked
her
exhausted
spirits
to
insensibility
had
not
the
extraordinary
assertion
at
its
end
and
sir
robert
audible
sobs
aroused
and
surprised
her
your
son
exclaimed
she
what
do
you
mean
my
uncle
thaddeus
will
explain
all
to
you
returned
he
may
heaven
bless
you
both
mary
was
too
much
astonished
to
think
of
following
her
agitated
uncle
out
of
the
room
she
sunk
on
a
seat
and
turning
her
gaze
full
of
amazement
towards
the
count
seemed
to
ask
an
explanation
thaddeus
who
still
retained
her
passive
hand
pressed
it
warmly
to
his
heart
and
whilst
his
effulgent
eyes
were
beaming
on
her
with
joyous
love
he
imparted
to
her
a
concise
but
impressive
narrative
of
his
relationship
with
sir
robert
he
touched
with
short
yet
deep
enthusiasm
with
more
than
one
tearful
pause
on
the
virtues
of
his
mother
he
acknowledged
the
unbounded
gratitude
which
was
due
to
that
god
who
had
so
wonderfully
conducted
him
to
find
a
parent
and
a
home
in
england
and
with
renewed
pathos
of
look
and
manner
ratified
the
proffer
which
sir
robert
had
made
of
his
heart
and
hand
to
her
who
alone
on
this
earth
had
reminded
him
of
that
angelic
parent
i
nave
seen
her
beloved
face
luminous
in
purity
and
tender
pity
reflected
in
yours
miss
beaufort
when
your
noble
heart
more
than
once
looked
in
compassion
on
her
son
and
i
then
felt
with
a
wondering
bewilderment
a
sacred
response
in
my
soul
though
i
could
not
explain
it
to
myself
but
since
then
that
sister
spirit
of
my
mother
has
often
whispered
it
as
if
direct
from
heaven
mary
had
listened
with
uncontrollable
emotion
to
this
interesting
detail
her
eyes
overflowed
their
ingenuous
language
enforced
by
the
warm
blood
which
glowed
on
her
cheek
did
not
require
the
medium
of
words
to
declare
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
thaddeus
gazed
on
her
with
a
certainty
of
bliss
which
penetrated
his
soul
until
its
raptures
almost
amounted
to
pain
the
heart
may
ache
with
joy
neither
sighs
nor
language
could
express
what
passed
in
his
mind
he
held
her
hand
to
his
lips
his
other
arm
fell
unconsciously
round
her
waist
and
in
a
moment
he
found
that
he
had
pressed
her
to
his
breast
his
heart
beat
violently
miss
beaufort
rose
instantaneously
from
her
chair
but
her
pure
nature
needed
no
disguise
she
looked
up
to
him
whilst
her
blushing
eyes
were
shedding
tears
of
delight
and
said
in
a
trembling
voice
tell
my
dear
uncle
that
mary
beaufort
glories
in
the
means
by
which
she
becomes
his
daughter
she
moved
to
the
door
thaddeus
whose
full
tide
of
transport
denied
him
utterance
only
clasped
her
hands
again
to
his
lips
and
bosom
then
relinquishing
them
he
suffered
her
to
quit
the
room
chapter
xlviii
a
family
party
the
magnificent
establishment
which
this
projected
union
offered
to
sobieski
seemed
to
heal
the
yet
bleeding
conscience
of
sir
robert
somerset
although
he
had
acquiesced
in
the
count
generous
surrender
of
the
honors
his
heart
remained
still
ill
at
ease
every
dutiful
expression
from
his
son
at
times
had
stung
him
with
remorse
but
miss
beaufort
avowed
and
returned
affection
at
once
removed
the
lingering
accuser
from
his
bosom
mistress
of
immense
wealth
her
hand
would
not
only
put
the
injured
thaddeus
in
possession
of
the
pure
delights
which
only
a
mutual
sympathy
can
bestow
but
would
enable
his
munificent
spirit
to
again
exert
itself
in
the
worthy
disposal
of
an
almost
princely
fortune
such
meditations
having
followed
the
now
tranquillized
baronet
to
his
pillow
they
brought
him
into
the
next
day
full
of
that
calm
pleasure
which
promises
a
steady
continuance
the
happy
family
were
assembled
miss
dorothy
saluted
her
brother
whose
brightened
eye
declared
that
he
had
something
pleasant
to
communicate
and
he
did
not
keep
her
in
suspense
with
the
first
cup
of
coffee
the
good
lady
poured
out
his
grateful
heart
unburdened
itself
of
the
delightful
tidings
that
ere
many
months
perhaps
weeks
he
had
reason
to
hope
miss
beaufort
would
give
her
hand
to
the
count
sobieski
pembroke
was
the
only
hearer
who
did
not
evince
surprise
at
this
announcement
every
one
else
had
been
kept
uninformed
on
the
especial
injunction
of
sir
robert
who
desired
its
knowledge
to
be
withheld
till
he
had
completed
some
necessary
preliminaries
in
his
mind
but
thaddeus
by
the
permission
of
the
happy
parent
during
a
long
and
interesting
conversation
in
his
library
which
passed
between
the
father
and
his
son
immediately
after
the
latter
blissful
parting
with
his
then
mary
had
hastened
to
his
brother
and
retiring
with
him
to
his
little
study
there
communicated
in
full
and
enraptured
confidence
the
whole
events
of
the
recent
mutual
explanations
during
sir
robert
animated
disclosure
mary
blushing
yet
grateful
eyes
sought
a
veil
in
a
branch
of
geranium
which
she
held
in
her
trembling
hand
miss
dorothy
rose
from
her
chair
her
smiling
tears
spoke
more
than
her
lips
when
she
pressed
first
her
niece
and
then
the
count
sobieski
in
her
venerable
arms
heaven
bless
you
both
cried
she
this
marriage
will
be
the
glory
of
my
age
miss
beaufort
turned
from
the
embrace
of
her
aunt
to
meet
the
warm
congratulations
of
pembroke
whilst
he
kissed
her
burning
cheek
he
whispered
loud
enough
for
every
one
to
hear
and
why
may
i
not
brighten
in
my
good
aunt
triumph
attempt
it
dear
mary
if
you
can
persuade
my
father
to
allow
me
to
make
myself
as
happy
with
lady
albina
stanhope
as
you
will
render
sobieski
i
shall
forever
bless
you
lady
albina
colored
and
looked
down
sir
robert
took
her
hand
with
pleased
surprise
do
you
my
lovely
guest
do
yon
sanction
what
this
bold
boy
has
just
said
lady
albina
made
no
answer
but
blushing
deeper
than
before
cast
a
sidelong
glance
at
pembroke
as
if
to
petition
his
support
he
was
at
her
side
in
an
instant
then
seriously
and
earnestly
entreating
his
father
consent
to
an
union
with
their
gentle
kinswoman
whose
approbation
he
had
obtained
the
preceding
day
in
the
shepherd
hut
he
awaited
with
anxiety
the
sounds
which
seemed
faltering
on
sir
robert
lips
the
baronet
quite
overcome
by
his
pembroke
having
like
his
brother
disposed
of
his
heart
so
much
to
his
own
honor
found
himself
unable
to
say
what
he
wished
joining
the
hands
of
the
two
young
people
in
silence
he
hurried
out
of
the
room
he
ascended
to
the
library
where
kneeling
down
he
returned
devout
thanks
to
that
being
who
had
crowned
one
so
unworthy
with
blessings
so
conspicuous
thaddeus
no
less
than
his
father
remembered
the
hand
which
having
guided
him
through
a
wilderness
of
sorrow
had
in
so
short
a
term
conducted
him
to
an
eden
of
bliss
long
afterwards
when
years
had
passed
over
his
happy
head
and
his
days
became
dedicated
to
various
important
duties
public
and
private
attendant
on
his
station
in
life
and
the
landed
power
he
held
in
his
adopted
country
never
did
he
forget
that
he
was
only
a
steward
of
the
benefactor
the
sense
of
whose
deputy
he
was
gave
to
his
heart
a
grateful
conviction
that
in
whatever
spot
he
might
be
so
placed
he
was
to
consider
it
as
his
country
the
canaan
of
his
commission
before
the
lapse
of
a
week
it
became
expedient
that
sir
robert
should
hasten
the
marriage
of
pembroke
with
lady
albina
or
be
forced
by
law
to
yield
her
to
the
demands
of
her
father
after
much
search
lord
tinemouth
had
discovered
that
his
daughter
was
under
the
protection
of
sir
robert
somerset
inflamed
with
rage
and
revenge
he
sent
to
order
her
immediate
return
under
pain
of
an
instantaneous
appeal
to
the
courts
of
judicature
too
well
aware
that
her
nonage
laid
her
open
to
the
realization
of
this
threat
lady
albina
fell
into
the
most
alarming
swoonings
on
the
first
communication
of
the
message
sir
robert
urged
that
in
her
circumstances
no
authority
could
be
opposed
to
the
earl
excepting
that
of
a
husband
and
on
this
consideration
she
complied
with
his
arguments
and
the
prayers
of
her
lover
to
directly
give
that
power
into
the
hands
of
pembroke
accordingly
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
accompanied
by
miss
dorothy
and
the
enraptured
somerset
the
terrified
lady
albina
commenced
her
journey
to
scotland
that
being
the
only
place
where
in
her
situation
the
marriage
could
be
legally
solemnized
a
clerical
friend
of
the
baronet
who
dwelt
just
over
the
borders
could
perform
the
rite
with
every
proper
respect
whilst
these
young
runaways
chaperoned
by
an
old
maiden
aunt
were
pursuing
their
rapid
flight
across
the
tweed
sir
robert
sent
his
steward
to
london
to
prepare
a
house
near
his
own
in
grosvenor
square
for
the
reception
of
the
bridal
pair
during
these
necessary
arrangements
a
happy
fortnight
elapsed
at
deerhurst
thrice
happy
to
mary
because
its
tranquil
hours
imparted
to
her
heart
a
sober
certainty
of
that
awaking
bliss
which
had
so
often
animated
with
hope
the
visions
of
her
imagination
when
contemplating
the
mystery
of
such
a
mind
as
that
of
thaddeus
having
been
destined
to
the
humble
lot
in
which
she
had
found
him
morning
noon
and
evening
the
loving
companion
of
the
count
sobieski
she
saw
with
deepened
devotedness
that
the
brave
and
princely
virtues
did
not
reign
alone
in
his
bosom
their
full
lustre
was
rendered
less
intense
by
the
softening
shades
of
those
gentler
amenities
which
are
the
soothers
and
sweeteners
of
life
his
breast
seemed
the
residence
of
love
of
a
love
that
not
only
infused
a
warmer
existence
through
her
soul
but
diffused
such
a
light
of
benevolence
over
every
being
within
its
influence
that
all
appeared
happy
who
caught
a
beam
of
his
eye
all
enchanted
who
shared
the
magic
of
his
smile
under
what
different
aspects
had
she
seen
this
man
yet
how
consistent
at
the
first
period
of
their
acquaintance
she
beheld
him
like
that
glorious
orb
which
her
ardent
fancy
told
her
he
resembled
struggling
with
the
storm
or
looking
dimmed
yet
unmoved
through
the
clouds
which
obscured
his
path
but
now
like
the
radiant
sun
of
summer
amidst
a
splendid
sky
he
seemed
to
stand
the
source
of
light
and
love
and
joy
thus
did
the
warm
fancy
and
warmer
heart
of
mary
beaufort
paint
the
image
of
her
lover
and
when
sir
robert
received
intelligence
that
the
scottish
party
had
arrived
in
town
and
were
impatient
for
the
company
of
the
beloved
inhabitants
of
deerhurst
while
preparing
to
revisit
the
proud
and
gay
world
she
confessed
that
some
embers
of
human
pride
did
sparkle
in
her
own
bosom
at
the
anticipation
of
witnessing
the
homage
which
they
who
had
despised
the
unfriended
constantine
tine
would
pay
to
the
declared
and
illustrious
sobieski
the
news
of
lady
albina
marriage
infuriated
the
earl
of
tinemouth
almost
to
frenzy
well
assured
that
his
withholding
her
fortune
would
occasion
no
vexation
to
a
family
of
sir
robert
somerset
vast
possessions
he
gave
way
to
still
more
vehement
bursts
of
passion
and
in
a
fit
of
impotent
threatening
embarked
with
all
his
household
to
spend
the
remainder
of
the
season
on
his
estates
in
ireland
this
abrupt
departure
of
the
earl
caused
lady
albina
little
uneasiness
his
unremitted
cruelty
her
brother
indifference
and
the
barbed
insults
of
lady
olivia
lovel
now
the
earl
wife
rankled
too
deeply
in
the
daughter
bosom
to
leave
any
filial
regret
behind
considering
their
absence
a
suspension
of
pain
rather
than
a
punishment
she
did
not
stain
the
kiss
which
she
imprinted
on
the
revered
cheek
of
her
new
parent
with
one
tear
to
the
memory
of
her
unnatural
father
whilst
all
was
splendor
and
happiness
in
grosvenor
square
thaddeus
did
not
forget
the
excellent
robson
he
hastened
to
lane
where
the
good
woman
received
him
with
open
arms
nanny
hung
crying
for
joy
upon
his
hand
and
sprung
rapturously
about
his
neck
when
he
told
her
he
was
now
a
rich
man
and
that
she
and
her
grandmother
should
live
with
him
forever
i
am
going
to
be
married
my
dear
robson
said
he
that
ministering
angel
who
visited
you
when
i
was
in
prison
was
sent
to
wipe
away
the
tears
from
my
eyes
drying
the
cheek
of
his
weeping
landlady
while
he
spoke
with
his
own
handkerchief
he
continued
she
commanded
me
not
to
leave
you
until
you
had
assured
me
that
you
will
brighten
our
happiness
by
taking
possession
of
a
pretty
cottage
close
to
her
house
in
kent
it
is
within
beaufort
park
and
there
my
mary
and
myself
will
visit
you
continually
blessed
mr
constantine
cried
the
worthy
woman
pressing
his
hand
myself
my
nanny
we
are
yours
take
us
where
you
please
for
wherever
you
go
there
will
the
almighty
hand
lead
us
and
there
will
his
right
hand
hold
us
the
count
rose
and
turned
to
the
window
his
heart
was
full
and
he
was
obliged
to
take
time
to
recover
himself
before
he
could
resume
the
conversation
he
saw
her
twice
after
this
and
on
the
day
of
her
departure
for
kent
to
await
in
her
own
new
home
his
and
his
arrival
there
he
put
into
her
hand
the
first
quarterly
payment
of
an
annuity
which
would
henceforward
afford
her
every
comfort
and
raise
her
to
that
easy
rank
in
society
which
her
gentle
manners
and
rare
virtues
were
so
admirably
fitted
to
adorn
neither
did
he
neglect
burket
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
allow
any
one
who
served
him
to
pass
unrewarded
he
called
on
him
on
the
last
day
he
visited
martin
lane
when
watts
too
shared
his
bounty
and
having
repaid
him
with
a
generosity
which
astonished
the
good
he
took
back
his
sword
and
the
venerated
old
seals
he
had
left
with
robson
to
get
repaired
by
the
same
honest
hand
also
the
other
precious
relics
he
had
had
refitted
to
their
original
settings
and
pressing
them
mournfully
yet
gratefully
to
his
breast
sir
robert
carriage
to
drive
home
what
bliss
to
his
heart
was
in
that
sword
next
day
thaddeus
directed
his
steps
to
cavendish
he
found
his
worthy
friend
at
home
who
received
him
with
kindness
but
how
was
that
kindness
increased
to
transport
when
thaddeus
told
him
with
a
smiling
countenance
that
he
was
the
very
sobieski
about
whose
wayward
fate
he
had
asked
so
many
questions
the
delighted
doctor
embraced
him
with
an
ardor
which
spoke
better
than
language
his
admiration
and
esteem
his
amazement
having
subsided
he
was
discoursing
with
animated
interest
on
events
at
once
so
fatal
and
so
glorious
to
sobieski
when
a
gentleman
was
announced
by
the
name
of
hopetown
he
entered
and
cavendish
at
the
same
time
introducing
thaddeus
as
the
count
sobieski
hopetown
fixed
his
eyes
upon
him
with
an
expression
which
neither
of
the
friends
could
comprehend
a
little
disconcerted
at
the
merchant
seeming
rudeness
the
good
doctor
attempted
to
draw
off
the
steadiness
of
his
gaze
by
asking
how
long
he
had
been
in
england
i
left
dantzic
replied
he
about
three
weeks
ago
and
i
should
have
been
in
london
five
days
since
but
a
favorite
horse
of
mine
which
i
brought
with
me
fell
sick
at
harwick
and
i
waited
until
he
was
well
enough
to
travel
whilst
he
spoke
he
never
withdrew
his
eyes
from
the
face
of
thaddeus
who
at
the
words
dantzic
and
horse
recollected
his
faithful
saladin
almost
hoping
that
this
hopetown
might
prove
to
be
the
briton
to
whom
he
had
consigned
the
noble
animal
he
took
a
part
in
the
conversation
by
inquiring
of
the
merchant
whether
he
were
a
resident
of
dantzic
no
your
excellency
replied
he
i
live
within
a
mile
of
it
several
years
ago
i
quitted
the
smoke
and
bustle
of
the
town
to
enjoy
fresh
air
and
quiet
last
year
rejoined
sobieski
i
passed
through
dantzic
on
my
way
to
england
i
believe
i
saw
your
house
and
remarked
its
situation
the
park
is
beautiful
and
i
am
indebted
count
resumed
the
merchant
to
nobleman
of
your
country
for
its
finest
ornament
i
mean
the
very
horse
i
spoke
of
just
now
he
was
sent
to
me
one
morning
with
a
letter
from
his
brave
owner
requesting
me
to
give
him
shelter
in
my
park
he
is
the
most
beautiful
animal
ever
beheld
unwilling
to
leave
behind
so
valuable
a
deposit
when
i
came
to
england
i
brought
him
with
me
poor
saladin
cried
thaddeus
his
heart
overflowing
with
remembrance
how
glad
i
shall
be
to
see
thee
what
was
the
horse
yours
asked
cavendish
surprised
at
this
apostrophe
yes
returned
thaddeus
he
was
mine
and
i
owe
to
hopetown
a
thousand
thanks
for
his
generous
acquiescence
with
the
prayers
of
an
unfortunate
stranger
no
thanks
to
me
count
sobieski
the
moment
i
entered
this
room
i
recollected
you
to
be
the
same
polish
officer
i
had
observed
on
the
beach
at
dantzic
when
i
described
your
figure
to
the
man
who
brought
the
horse
he
said
it
was
the
same
who
gave
him
the
letter
i
could
not
learn
your
excellency
name
but
i
hoped
one
day
or
other
to
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
again
and
of
returning
saladin
into
your
hands
in
as
good
condition
as
when
he
came
to
mine
tears
started
into
the
eyes
of
thaddeus
that
horse
hopetown
has
carried
me
through
many
a
bloody
field
he
alone
witnessed
my
last
adieu
to
the
bleeding
corpse
of
my
country
i
shall
receive
him
again
as
an
old
and
dear
friend
but
to
his
kind
protector
how
can
i
ever
demonstrate
the
whole
of
my
gratitude
footnote
the
love
of
thaddeus
to
his
horse
has
had
some
resemblances
in
the
author
knowledge
in
yet
more
recent
times
it
seems
to
belong
to
the
brave
heart
of
every
country
in
our
civilized
europe
as
well
as
in
that
of
the
wild
arab
of
the
desert
to
companion
itself
with
his
as
with
a
friend
or
brother
i
knew
more
than
one
gallant
man
who
wept
over
the
doom
of
his
old
charger
when
shot
in
the
lines
near
corunna
and
another
of
the
same
and
other
fields
who
can
never
mention
without
turning
pale
the
name
of
his
faithful
and
beloved
horse
columbus
who
had
carried
him
through
various
dangers
on
the
south
american
continent
and
at
last
perished
by
his
side
during
a
tremendous
storm
at
sea
when
no
exertions
of
his
master
could
save
him
these
are
pangs
of
which
only
those
who
have
the
generous
sensibility
to
feel
them
can
have
any
idea
but
they
are
true
to
the
noble
nature
of
which
the
inspired
page
speaks
when
it
says
the
just
man
is
merciful
to
his
beast
the
benignant
master
of
the
regretted
columbian
steed
was
the
late
sir
porter
the
lamented
brother
of
the
yet
surviving
writer
of
the
preceding
to
have
had
it
in
my
power
to
serve
the
count
sobieski
is
a
privilege
of
itself
returned
hopetown
i
am
proud
of
that
distinction
to
be
called
the
friend
of
a
man
who
all
the
world
honors
will
be
a
title
which
john
hopetown
may
be
proud
of
before
the
worthy
merchant
took
his
leave
he
promised
thaddeus
to
send
saladin
to
grosvenor
square
that
evening
and
accepted
his
invitation
to
meet
him
and
cavendish
the
following
day
at
dinner
at
somerset
chapter
xlix
if
i
forget
thee
o
jerusalem
let
my
right
hand
forget
her
cunning
lady
albina
somerset
arrival
in
london
was
greeted
by
the
immediate
visits
of
all
the
persons
in
town
who
had
been
esteemed
by
the
late
countess
of
tinemouth
or
on
intimate
terms
with
the
family
it
was
not
the
gay
season
for
the
metropolis
amongst
the
earliest
names
that
appeared
at
her
door
were
those
of
lord
berrington
the
hon
captain
and
montresor
and
the
rev
blackmore
under
any
circumstances
either
in
the
country
or
in
town
somerset
and
his
young
bride
did
not
propose
opening
their
gates
to
more
general
acquaintances
until
miss
beaufort
and
the
count
were
married
and
both
bridal
parties
had
been
presented
at
court
in
the
spring
to
this
little
select
group
of
friends
who
were
to
assemble
round
somerset
table
on
the
appointed
day
thaddeus
informed
him
with
frank
pleasure
that
he
had
taken
the
liberty
of
adding
cavendish
and
hopetown
of
dantzic
lady
albina
received
the
two
strangers
with
graceful
hospitality
the
affianced
mary
with
an
equally
blushing
grace
presented
her
hand
to
the
generous
protector
of
saladin
accompanying
the
action
with
a
modest
acknowledgment
of
her
interest
in
an
animal
so
deservedly
dear
to
the
count
sobieski
he
had
turned
to
meet
lord
berrington
and
the
ever
lively
sophia
egerton
now
montresor
who
both
advanced
to
him
at
the
same
instant
to
express
their
gratulations
not
only
at
seeing
him
again
but
in
a
situation
of
happy
promise
so
consonant
to
his
avowed
rank
and
personal
early
fame
thaddeus
replied
to
their
felicitations
with
a
smiling
dignity
in
that
ingenuous
manner
peculiarly
his
own
he
was
not
a
little
surprised
when
blackmore
soon
after
recognized
him
to
be
the
noble
foreigner
whose
appearance
had
so
much
excited
his
attention
about
a
twelvemonth
ago
at
the
hummuins
in
covent
garden
the
count
did
not
recollect
the
circumstance
of
having
seen
the
good
doctor
there
but
the
venerable
man
recapitulated
the
scene
in
the
room
through
which
the
count
had
passed
describing
with
no
little
animation
a
pedantic
mannered
person
dressed
in
black
and
wearing
spectacles
whose
name
he
afterwards
learned
was
loftus
an
of
one
of
the
colleges
who
took
the
liberty
to
make
some
not
very
liberal
remarks
on
the
number
of
noble
strangers
then
confiding
themselves
to
the
honorable
sanctuary
and
sympathy
of
our
country
pembroke
could
hardly
hear
the
benevolent
speaker
to
the
end
stifling
any
audible
expression
of
his
indignation
he
whispered
to
the
baronet
my
dear
father
recent
happy
events
have
made
us
almost
forget
that
villain
baseness
but
i
pray
let
him
not
remain
another
week
a
blot
upon
our
house
escutcheon
all
shall
be
done
as
you
wish
returned
his
father
in
the
same
subdued
tone
but
let
us
remember
how
much
of
that
recent
happiness
the
goodness
of
providence
hath
brought
out
of
this
wretched
offence
were
i
extreme
to
mark
what
is
done
amiss
how
could
i
abide
the
sentence
that
might
be
justly
pronounced
against
myself
morrow
we
will
talk
over
this
matter
and
settle
it
i
trust
with
satisfaction
to
all
parties
pembroke
gratefully
pressed
his
father
hand
and
then
walking
up
the
room
addressed
montresor
in
a
few
minutes
her
brave
husband
joined
them
while
talking
of
his
late
victorious
and
voyage
he
spoke
with
great
regret
of
the
threatened
absence
from
england
of
his
late
colleague
on
the
of
the
ocean
his
old
friend
captain
ross
how
whither
is
he
going
asked
his
wife
in
a
tone
of
interest
montresor
replied
the
ill
state
of
lady
sara
health
requires
a
milder
air
and
poor
ross
means
to
take
her
without
loss
of
time
to
italy
i
met
him
this
morning
in
despair
about
the
suddenness
of
some
alarming
symptoms
thaddeus
too
well
divined
that
this
increased
indisposition
owed
its
rise
to
his
recent
return
to
town
and
inwardly
petitioning
heaven
that
absence
and
her
husband
devoted
tenderness
might
complete
her
cure
he
could
not
repress
a
sigh
wrung
from
his
respectful
pity
towards
her
in
this
deep
with
herself
no
one
present
except
the
future
partner
of
his
own
heart
marked
the
transient
melancholy
which
passed
over
his
countenance
she
who
had
suspected
the
unhappy
lady
sara
attachment
loved
thaddeus
if
possible
still
dearer
for
the
compassion
he
bestowed
on
the
meek
penitence
of
the
unhappy
victim
of
a
passion
often
as
inscrutable
as
destructive
when
the
party
descended
to
dinner
miss
dorothy
who
sat
next
to
the
count
sobieski
rallied
him
upon
the
utter
desertion
of
one
of
his
most
pertinacious
allies
or
adversaries
she
did
not
know
which
to
call
the
fair
delinquent
for
admiring
or
detesting
seemed
quite
the
same
to
some
ladies
so
they
did
but
show
their
power
of
mischief
over
any
poor
mortal
man
they
found
in
their
way
this
strange
attack
though
uttered
in
perfect
good
humor
by
the
lively
old
lady
following
so
closely
the
information
relative
to
lady
sara
ross
summoned
a
fervid
color
into
the
count
face
he
looked
surprised
and
rather
confused
at
the
revered
speaker
who
soon
gayly
related
what
she
had
been
told
that
morning
by
her
milliner
of
miss
euphemia
dundas
being
on
the
point
of
marriage
with
a
young
scotch
nobleman
in
berwickshire
and
in
proof
her
elegant
informant
madame
de
maradon
was
making
the
bridal
so
much
the
better
for
all
people
chere
cried
pembroke
little
phemy
was
no
contemptible
assailant
either
way
besides
added
he
turning
airily
to
his
own
gentle
bride
you
my
young
lady
may
congratulate
yourself
on
the
same
good
hope
i
hear
that
an
old
of
mine
is
going
to
take
her
loving
sister
off
my
hands
come
lord
berrington
you
must
verify
my
report
for
i
learned
it
from
you
his
lordship
smiled
and
answered
in
the
affirmative
adding
that
a
friend
of
his
in
lincolnshire
had
written
to
him
as
most
amusing
news
that
the
most
worthy
orson
heir
of
all
the
lands
tenements
stables
and
kennels
of
the
doughty
sir
helerand
shafto
of
that
ilk
and
twenty
ilks
besides
north

her
very
veritable
valentine
to
whom
she
was
now
preparing
to
give
her
fair
and
hand
in
the
course
of
the
forthcoming
month
that
is
when
the
season
of
hunting
and
shooting
is
past
and
gone
and
the

may
turn
themselves
with
their
blown
horses
and

a
little
wholesome
rustication

the
smile
that
played
on

lips
at
the
whimsical
description
given
by
lord
berrington
correspondent
wished
the
nuptials
happy
as
far
as
the
parties
could
comprehend
the
feeling

more
generous
than
just
in
such
a
benediction

vow
to

cried
his

never

bent

mischief

those

of

fate
when

springs
her

ah
poor
fool
exclaimed
montresor
i
warrant
he
will
not
escape
the
punishment
he
merits
for
stepping
between
the
goddess
and
her
delectable
endymion
lascelles
quarter
for
an
old
acquaintance
whispered
miss
beaufort
in
a
beseeching
voice
she
does
not
deserve
it
of
you
returned
the
lady
pursuing
her
ridiculous
game
until
both
miss
dorothy
and
sir
robert
petitioned
for
mercy
from
so
fair
a
judge
thaddeus
who
possessed
not
the
disposition
to
exult
in
the
misconduct
or
mischances
of
any
one
who
had
injured
him
felt
this
part
of
the
conversation
the
least
pleasant
on
that
happy
day
and
to
change
its
strain
he
in
his
turn
whispered
to
his
father
to
prevail
on
lady
albina
to
indulge
his
friend
hopetown
by
singing
a
few
passages
from
that
beautiful
ballad
of
the
scottish
borders
chase
which
had
so
delighted
their
own
family
party
the
preceding
evening
he
did
not
ask
this
charmed
resource
from
his
own
betrothed
because
it
was
only
at
the
close
of
that
very
preceding
evening
he
had
for
the
first
time
heard
her
voice
in
sweetest
melody
chanting
forth
the
parting
anthem
for
the
night
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
i
will
call
upon
thee
o
lord
and
with
tones
of
a
kindred
pathos
too
thrilling
to
a
son
startled
ear
and
memory
to
be
invoked
again
in
a
mixed
company
strange
indeed
it
might
be
but
it
was
a
sacred
balm
to
his
soul
when
these
recurring
remembrances
discovered
to
his
heart
in
the
young
and
lovely
future
partner
of
his
life
a
bond
of
union
with
that
angelic
mother
who
had
given
him
being
and
perhaps
this
devoted
filial
heart
alone
could
appreciate
the
joy
the
comfort
the
bliss
of
such
a
similitude
but
in
after
days
he
shared
those
feelings
with
his
father
bringing
to
his
regretful
bosom
a
soothing
perception
of
the
likeness
lady
albina
instantly
complied
casting
a
sweet
glance
at
sir
robert
who
immediately
led
her
to
the
followed
by
the
scottish
merchant
of
the
baltic
whither
the
noble
symphony
of
the
douglas
hound
and
horn
soon
gathered
the
rest
of
the
company
the
remainder
of
the
evening
passed
away
delightfully
in
the
awakened
harmony

mary
accompanied
that
well
known
pibroch
of
the
bruce
with
a
true
responsive
echo
from
her
harp
but
she
declined
singing
herself
and
when
thaddeus
took
the
relinquished
instrument
from
her
hand
he
pressed
it
with
a
silent
tenderness
sweeter
to
her
than
could
have
been
the
plaudits
of
all
the
accomplished
listeners
around
that
soft
hand
had
stroked
the
branching
neck
of
his
recovered
saladin
the
same
morning
and
the
happy
master
now
marked
his
feeling
of
the
gentle
deed
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
pembroke
wishes
with
regard
to
loftus
were
put
into
a
train
of
fulfilment
blackmore
having
undertaken
to
find
a
fitting
tutor
for
the
young
lord
avon
and
in
the
interim
would
receive
him
into
his
own
classical
instruction
whenever
it
should
be
deemed
proper
to
terminate
his
present
holiday
visit
in
bedfordshire
but
whilst
sir
robert
had
thus
adjudged
the
guilty
he
was
careful
not
to
expose
him
to
fresh
temptations
nor
to
suffer
his
crimes
to
implicate
the
innocent
in
its
punishment
hence
in
pity
to
age
and
helplessness
he
determined
to
settle
two
hundred
pounds
per
annum
on
the
wretched
man
mother
and
sisters
who
dwelt
together
in
wales
shortly
after
in
consequence
of
his
contrite
confessions
that
all
somerset
allegations
against
him
were
too
true
the
humane
father
and
son
appointed
one
hundred
pounds
more
to
be
paid
yearly
to
the
culprit
himself
so
that
at
least
he
might
not
be
induced
to
lighten
his
honest
labors
for
a
suitable
subsistence
by
renewed
villanies
with
reference
to
the
benefice
of
somerset
which
had
been
the
price
of
this
base
pretender
to
sanctity
and
truth
sir
robert
decided
on
presenting
it
to
the
exemplary
blackmore
whenever
it
should
become
vacant
meanwhile
the
baronet
sojourn
in
town
became
indispensably
prolonged
not
only
by
the
simple
nature
of
the
affairs
that
brought
him
thither
but
by
certain
intricacies
occurring
in
making
a
final
adjustment
of
the
various
settlements
and
consequent
conveyances
to
be
effected
on
account
of
the
two
felicitous
marriages
in
his
family
during
these
lingering
proceedings
amongst
the
legal
protectors
of
soil
and
surety
miss
beaufort
remained
the
cherished
and
cheering
guest
of
the
already
espoused
pair
one
of
whom
indeed
still
wore
the
garb
of
a
mourning
bride
but
all
within
was
clad
in
the
true
white
robe
of
nuptial
purity
and
peace
sobieski
was
the
now
no
less
privileged
abiding
inmate
in
the
home
and
heart
of
sir
robert
somerset
increasing
daily
in
favor
with
good
aunt
dorothy
the
presiding
mistress
of
his
father
house
he
soon
became
nearly
as
precious
in
her
sight
as
had
long
been
the
pleasant
society
of
her
nephew
pembroke
and
all
this
her
ingenuous
and
affectionate
nature
avowed
to
mary
in
their
frequent
visits
between
the
two
houses
with
a
sort
of
delighted
wonder
at
her
heart
so
prescient
recognition
of
the
new
nephew
her
sweet
niece
was
to
bestow
upon
her
for
it
had
not
yet
been
revealed
to
her
that
thaddeus
did
stand
in
that
same
tender
relationship
to
her
by
a
former
marriage
of
her
beloved
brother
with
the
lamented
mother
of
the
noble
object
of
her
cherished
esteem
and
what
was
the
double
joy
of
the
blessed
moment
when
that
happy
secret
was
confided
to
her
bosom
the
last
busy
month
of
autumn
in
london
had
not
only
laid
down
its
wearied
head
under
the
dark
canopy
of
a
murky
atmosphere
lit
with
dimmed
to
its
slumbers
but
its
expected
refreshment
in
the
country
did
not
offer
much
more
agreeable
materials
for
repose
and
vernal
renovation
there
were
blustering
winds
strewing
the
recently
green
earth
with
beds
of
withered
leaves
of
every
foliage
stripped
and
fallen
from
the
shivering
woods
above
and
there
were
drenching
rains
laying
the
lately
pleasant
fields
in
trackless
swamps
and
swelling
the
clear
and
gentle
brooks
into
brawling
floods
rending
asunder
the
rustic
bridges
which
had
hitherto
linked
the
villages
together
in
convenient
passages
for
wholesome
relaxation
or
useful
toil
such
were
the
newspaper
accounts
from
the
country
during
the
latter
part
of
november
but
there
was
seen
a
fairer
prospect
from
the
carriage
windows
of
sir
robert
somerset
when
he
and
his
gladdened
party
one
bright
morning
on
quitting
the
splashy
environs
of
hammersmith
and
brentford
entered
the
broad
expanse
of
hounslow
heath
on
their
way
into
warwickshire
and
beheld
its
wide
common
covered
with
a
fair
carpet
of
spotless
snow
winter
had
then
seriously
or
rather
smilingly
set
in
it
was
the
of
december
and
the
baronet
having
signed
and
sealed
all
things
necessary
to
transfer
with
perfect
satisfaction
himself
and
family
as
was
always
his
custom
at
this
homeward
season
now
set
forth
to
one
or
other
of
his
ancient
domains
to
pass
his
christmas
in
the
bosom
of
an
enlarged
and
a
grateful
domestic
happiness
thus
year
after
year
he
diffused
from
each
of
those
parental
mansions
that
bounteous
hospitality
to
high
and
low
which
he
considered
to
be
an
especial
duty
in
an
english
gentleman
whether
in
the
character
of
landlord
to
noble
guests
and
respected
neighbors
or
to
wayfaring
strangers
passing
by
or
while
graciously
mingling
with
his
established
tenantry
or
his
equally
regarded
daily
guests
at
this
holy
festival
the
virtuous
lowly
peasantry
laborers
on
the
land
then
smiled
the
cottager
with
honest
consciousness
of
yeoman
worth
when
seated
in
the
great
hall
under
the
eye
of
his
munificent
lord
who
partook
of
the
general
feast
then
too
did
he
smile
when
at
the
head
of
his
own
little
board
he
sat
with
his
children
and
humbler
dependents
all
furnished
with
ample
christmas
fare
by
the
baronet
still
open
hand
when
thaddeus
shared
these
primeval
scenes
of
old
england
by
the
side
of
his
british
parent
which
festivities
are
still
honorably
preserved
by
some
of
its
most
ancient
and
noblest
families
they
brought
back
to
his
heart
those
similar
assemblages
at
villanow
and
in
cracovia
where
his
revered
grandfather
the
palatine
had
reigned
prince
and
father
over
every
happy
breast
footnote
the
writer
remembers
a
similar
scene
to
the
above
when
she
had
the
honor
of
dining
along
with
her
revered
family
on
a
festival
of
at
bushy
palace
when
its
royal
owner
his
late
majesty
was
duke
of
clarence
himself
moved
through
his
rustic
guests
in
the
gracious
manner
described
and
happy
were
now
the
recollections
of
all
who
met
at
deerhurst
on
this
their
first
joyful
christmas
season
week
after
week
glided
along
in
the
bland
exercise
of
social
duties
aided
by
the
more
homefelt
enjoyments
of
sweet
domestic
affections
which
gave
a
living
grace
to
all
that
was
said
or
done
and
more
intimately
knit
hearts
together
never
more
to
be
divided
but
winter
howling
blasts
and
sheltering
halls
where
fireside
comforts
taste
and
gentle
love
with
soft
amenities
mingled
into
bliss
swiftly
and
fairer
changed
their
pleasant
song
proclaiming
in
every
brightening
hue
the
hymn
of
nature

they

the
rolling

full
of
thee
forth
in
the
pleasing
spring
thy
beauty

thy
tenderness
and
love
and
in
the
first
month
of
that
genial
season
when
the
young
grass
covers
the
downy
hills
with
verdure
and
the
glowing
branches
of
the
trees

an
infant
foliage

day

fixed
by
sir
robert
somerset
and
approved
by
the
beloved
objects
of
his
then
peculiar
solicitude
in
which
his
paternal
hand
should
plight
theirs
together
before
the
altar
of
eternal
truth
the
solemnity
was
to
be
performed
in
the
village

which
stood
in
the
park

who
came
over
from
his

accompanied
by

pupil

perform

rite

from
his
infancy
had
been
reared
in
the
protestant
faith
the
faith
of
his
mother
whose
own
mother
was
a
daughter
of
the
staunch
hussite
race
of
the
princely
zamoiski
who
still
professed
that
ancient
simple
creed
of
their
country
it
was
also
the
national
faith
of
him
who
had
given
therese

being
therefore
to
the
same
pure
doctrine
of
christianity
had
she
dedicated
his
deserted
child
and
should
they
ever
meet
again
she
believed
it
must
be
before
the
throne
of
divine
mercy
and
there
she
trusted
to
present
their
solitary
offspring
with
the
sacred
words
here
i
am
lord
and
the
child
thou
didst
give
me
but
to
return
to
the
itself
the
hour
having
arrived
in
which
the
mary
beaufort
was
to
resign
herself
and
her
earthly
happiness
into
the
power
of
the
only
man
to
whom
having
once
beheld
and
known
him
she
could
ever
have
committed
them
she
pronounced
her
vows
at
the
sacred
altar
with
unsteadiness
of
tongue
but
with
a
fixed
heart
and
when
after
embracing
all
the
fond
kindred
so
long
dear
to
her
and
now
to
him
and
having
received
their
parting
blessings
within
the
walls
of
her
home
sweet
while
familiar
deerhurst
she
was
driven
rapidly
through
its
gates
while
a
mixed
and
awed
emotion
agitated
her
breast
but
immediately
she
felt
the
supporting
arm
of
her
husband
gently
pressing
her
trembling
form
and
so
with
all
that
husband
tender
sympathy
the
hours
glided
away
unperceived
till
the
august
towers
of
her
own
native
domain
appeared
on
the
evening
horizon
and
soon
afterwards
she
alighted
at
the
mansion
itself
having
passed
along
a
central
avenue
of
ancient
oaks
amid
the
congratulatory
cheers
of
a
large
assemblage
of
her
tenantry
on
horseback
and
on
foot
planted
on
each
side
to
bid
a
glad
welcome
to
their
liege
lady
and
her
lord
within
the
great
entrance
of
the
baronial
hall

opened
to
her
by
the
immediate
raising
of
a
massive
brazen
portcullis
the
ancient
insignia
of
the
beaufort
name
she
received
the
joyful
obeisance
of
the
old
domestics
of
her
honored
parents
hailing
her
their
beloved
daughter
with
a
humble
ardor
of
affection
that
bathed
her
enraptured
face
with
filial
tears
thaddeus
felt
the
scene
in
his
own
recollective
heart
next
morning
robson
and
the
delighted
nanny
dressed
in
a
white
frock
for
the
blissful
occasion
on
being
brought
into
the
countess
private
saloon
threw
themselves
at
the
feet
of
their
benefactors
and
sobbed
forth
their
happiness
the
still
more
happy
sobieski
raised
them
in
his
arms
and
embracing
both
accosted
the
old
lady
as
he
would
have
done
a
revered
relative
and
the
affectionate
little
girl
like
an
adopted
child
the
same
day
the
vicar
of
beaufort
whose
large
rural
parish
extended
from
the
castle
to
several
miles
around
rode
to
the
gate
and
was
announced
by
name
the
rev
tillotson
to
pay
his
pastoral
duty
to
his
future
noble
neighbors
and
sacred
charge
the
owners
of
the
land
his
is
a
good
name
observed
mary
with
a
gracious
smile
it
was
borne
by
one
of
the
brightest
luminaries
of
our
protestant
church
archbishop
tillotson
whose
works
you
will
find
in
the
family
library
now
your
own
and
his
descendant
the
revered
late
vicar
christened
me
in
the
dear
old
church
of
the
adjacent
village
to
which
we
go
sunday
oh
how
much
have
i
to
bless
heaven
for
in
that
holy
place
she
tenderly
ejaculated
you
kneeling
by
my
side
there
one
faith
one
heart
one
death
one
salvation
o
my
husband
i
am
blessed
indeed
my
mary
in
earth
and
heaven
was
his
soul
response
and
with
the
words
he
pressed
her
hands
with
a
hallowed
emotion
to
his
lips
in
a
few
minutes
after
this
she
led
the
way
to
the
ancient
library
tapestried
with
family
portraits
and
furnished
with
of
every
past
generation
thither
the
young
vicar
a
truly
worthy
successor
to
his
pious
father
had
been
conducted
and
there
being
introduced
by
the
countess
who
had
seen
him
only
once
before
to
her
lord
they
found
him
not
merely
a
clergyman
to
be

a

devolved

indeed
passed
through

in

he
had
been
supported
by

stepped

on

she
leaned
to
walk
through

that

should
meet
them
at

thaddeus
not
being
aware
that
this
porch
belonged
to
the
church
where
his
veteran
friend
had
been
buried
gave
instant
assent
and
before
he
had
time
to
make
more
than
a
few
remarks
on
the
pure
religious
architecture
of
the
building
which
he
thought
had
attracted
his
tasteful
bride
to
take
a
nearer
view
she
had
led
him
unconsciously
to
the
general
grave
but
it
was
no
longer
the
same
as
when
sobieski
last
stood
by
its
side
a
simple
white
marble
tomb
now
occupied
the
place
of
its

long

and

thaddeus
for
a
moment
felt
as
he
did
when
he
beheld
those
mortal
remains
laid
there
but
his
own
faith
in
that
hope
which
consecrated
this
mortality
to
an
immortal
resurrection
had
then
silently
spread
the
balm
of
its
full
assurance
overall
those
remembered
pangs
and
now
without
speaking
he
led
his
also
pensive
and
tremulous
companion
to
her
carriage
where
it
awaited
them
and
seating
her
within
it
clasped
her
to
his
breast
his
tears
no
longer
restrained
poured
those
sweet
pledges
of
a
approbation
into
her
bosom
that
made
it
even
ache
with
excess
of
happiness

while
the
grateful
voice
of
her
husband
was
beginning
to
breathe
its
uttered
thanks
he
found
the

stop
again
in
a
street
not
far
distant
from
the
one
they
had
just
quitted
it
drew
up
at
the
door
of
a
handsome
house
of
an
apparently
contemporary
structure
with
the
church
it
was
the
rectory
of
paul
covent
garden
and
at
its
portal
stood
the
reverend
incumbent
evidently
awaiting
to
receive
his
guests
thaddeus
perceived
him
and
also
the
welcome
of
his
position
so
did
his
gentle
wife
who
with
a
blushing
smile
explained
all
the
alterations
he
had
observed
on
the
respected
grave
avowing
that
they
had
been
done
at
her
devoted
wish
and
were
effected
by
the
kind
agency
of
that
venerable
man
the
rector
of
the
church
the
honorable
bruce
she
then
timidly
added
and
how
beautiful
in
that
timidity
she
had
something
more
to
confess
she
had
ventured
after
obtaining
permission
of
the
rector
for
the
erection
of
the
monument
to
see
it
once
during
its
progress
and
then
to
promise
him
that
on
its
completion
her
honored
husband
the
count
sobieski
whose
parental
friend
that
noble
dead
had
been
would
when
she
revealed
her
secret
to
him
pay
a
personal
visit
along
with
herself
to
her
beneficent
coadjutor
and
duly
express
their
united
gratitude
she
had
scarcely
spoken
her
rapid
information
when
its
courteous
object
descended
the
portal
to
approach
the
carriage
his
hat
was
taken
off
and
the
hair
blown
suddenly
by
a
gust
of
wind
across
his
benign
brow
a
little
obscured
his
face
while
he
conducted
the
lady
from
the
carriage
up
the
steps
of
his
door
but
sobieski
found
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
the
locks
which
had
been
wetted
by
the
weeping
heavens
in
that
hour
of
his
lonely
sorrow
whilst
committing
to
the
dust
the
remains
of
him
whose
sacred
memorial
he
had
just
contemplated
raised
by
a
wife
clear
hand
with
these
recollections
had
arisen
the
image
of
the
pale
boy
who
had
gazed
so
compassionately
into
his
eyes
while
taking
as
he
thought
his
last
look
at
that
humble
grave
and
with
this
bland
recurrence
came
also
the
almost
closing
words
of
the
solemn
service
seeming
again
to
proclaim
to
his
heart
i
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
me
write
from
henceforth
blessed
are
the
dead
who
die
in
the
lord
with
calmed
feelings
and
perfectly
recovered
thaddeus
now
followed
his
beloved
wife
his
solace
and
his
joy
led
by
her
delighted
host
into
the
parlor
of
the
rectory
where
the
mutual
introduction
instantly
took
place
the
beneficent
old
man
with
a
polished
sincerity
declared
his
high
gratification
at
this
visit
from
the
count
sobieski
brought
to
him
by
the
gracious
lady
who
so
deservedly
shared
his
illustrious
name
thaddeus
with
his
usual
modest
dignity
received
the
implied
compliment
and
expressed
his
just
sense
of
the
deep
obligation
conferred
on
him
and
his
countess
by
the
last
consecrated
rite
to
the
memory
of
his
most
revered
friend
mary
was
then
seated
on
an
settee
opposite
to
the
of
the
apartment
the
rector
with
a
courteous
bow
which
in
his
youth
would
have
been
called
graceful
as
if
confident
of
a
permitted
privilege
placed
himself
beside
her
while
observing
to
her
lord
in
reply
to
these
unfeigned
thanks
that
the
reported
name
alone
of
the
veteran
patriot
who
lay
there
had
not
ceased
from
the
day
of
his
interment
to
attract
the
pilgrim
feet
of
many
persons
to
the
spot
who
respected
and
bewailed
the
fate
of
poland
sobieski
cheek
flushed
and
his
eye
kindled
at
this
testimony
to
change
a
subject
which
he
found
wrought
too
powerfully
on
the
serenity
of
his
mind
he
affectionately
inquired
for
the
amiable
boy
he
had
seen
take
so
touching
an
interest
in
the
mournful
errand
to
the
on
that
day
and
who
like
a
ministering
seraph
had
so
guardingly
watched
the
exposed
head
of
his
revered
master
under
the
pitiless
element
then
pouring
down
he
is
my
nephew
returned
the
rector
in
a
tone
of
tenderness
lord
edward
he
is
in
delicate
health
the
youngest
son
of
my
eldest
brother
the
marquis
who
married
late
in
life
edward
is
indeed
what
he
appears
a
spirit
of
innocent
happy
love
or
of
condoling
commiseration
wherever
his
gentle
footsteps
move
and
when
i
rejoin
him
this
autumn
at
his
father
house
in
scotland
and
shall
tell
him
that
the
chief
mourner
at
that
simple
bier
with
whom
his
own
young
tears
fell
in
spontaneous
sympathy
was
the
count
sobieski
a
kinsman
of
his
own
whose
character
was
already
known
to
him
in
its
youthful
fame
and
by
its
honored
name
what
will
be
that
meek
child
exulting
ecstasy
a
kinsman
of
that
noble
boy
echoed
thaddeus
in
surprise
how
may
i
flatter
myself
it
can
be
so
mary
simultaneously
uttered
an
amazed
ejaculation
of
pleasure
at
the
idea
of
any
real
relationship
between
that
venerable
man
and
herself
and
he
with
an
answering
look
of
kindred
respect
on
both
the
astonished
husband
and
his
bride
replied
to
the
former
with
the
unstudied
brevity
of
truth
a
few
sentences
will
explain
it
for
i
consider
it
unnecessary
to
remind
my
present
auditors
of
two
great
events
in
their
respective
countries
first
with
regard
to
england
the
change
of
royal
succession
in
the
stuart
line
from
the
branch
of
which
james
the
second
was
the
head
to
that
of
backward
step
originating
in
elizabeth
of
bohemia
the
daughter
of
james
the
first
and
therefore
the
aunt
of
james
the
second
at
the
height
of
these
eventful
circumstances
the
offended
sovereign
retired
with
his
exemplary
queen
and
their
infant
son
to
the
continent
there
the
royal
boy
continued
to
be
styled
by
his
father
adherents
james
prince
of
wales
but
in
the
general
world
was
usually
known
by
the
cognizance
of
the
chevalier
george
this
is
the
first
link
in
our
bracelet
noble
lady
observed
the
narrator
with
a
smile
and
then
proceeded
i
now
advance
to
my
second
part
the
crisis
of
which
took
place
in
poland
about
the
same
period
at
the
death
of
the
great
john
sobieski
king
of
poland
the
father
of
his
people
there
arose
a
conspiracy
in
certain
neighboring
states
jealous
of
his
late
power
and
glorious
name
determining
to
undermine
the
accession
of
his
family
to
the
throne
and
they
found
an
apt
soil
to
work
on
in
a
corresponding
feeling
ready
to
break
out
amongst
some
of
the
most
influential
nobles
of
the
realm
foreign
and
domestic
revolutionists
soon
understand
each
other
and
the
dynasty
of
sobieski
being
speedily
overturned
by
the
double
treason
of
pretended
friends
and
false
allies
his
three
princely
sons
withdrew
from
occasioning
the
dire
conflict
of
a
civil
war
two
into
distant
lands
the
other
to
the
ancestral
patrimony
in
provinces
far
from
the
intrigues
of
ambition
or
the
temptation
of
its
treacherous
lures
the
two
elder
brothers
in
a
natural
indignation
against
the
popular
ingratitude
took
the
expatriating
destination
but
constantine
the
youngest
born
with
the
calm
dignity
of
a
son
without
other
desired
inheritance
than
the
honor
of
such
a
parent
retired
to
the
tranquil
seclusion
of
the
castled
domain
of
olesko
the
ancient
fortified
palace
of
his
progenitors
on
the
polish
border
of
red
russia
and
there
in
philosophic
quiet
he
passed
his
blameless
days
with
science
and
the
arts
and
in
deeds
of
true
christian
purport
of
his
life
this
respected
seclusion
was
ultimately
sweetly
cheered
when
woman
smiled
upon
it
in
the
form
of
a
fair
daughter
of
a
neighboring
magnate
in
the
adjacent
province
whose
noble
retirement
sharing
the
same
patriotic
principles
with
those
of
constantine
yielded
to
the
young
philosopher
a
lovely
helpmate
for
him
prince
james
his
eldest
brother
had
meanwhile
married
a
sister
of
their
early
associate
in

brave
charles
of
newburg

under
the
royal
banner
of
sobieski
in
the
memorable
field
of
vienna
alexander
the
second
son
also
met
with

late
king

describes
them
in
his
curious
reminiscences
thus
majesty
possessed
a
fine
figure
he
was
tall
and
graceful
the
nobleness
and
elevation
of
his
soul
were
deeply
depicted
in
his
countenance
and
air
prince
james
is
slender
in
person
and
more
like
a
spaniard
than
a
pole

is

social
courteous

liberal

manly
proportions
and

true
sarmatian
physiognomy

constantine
is
an
exact
likeness
of
the

footnote
the
writer
of
this
note
has
seen
a
magnificent
picture
of
that
glorious
king

full
length
the
stature

it
was
nobly
painted
by
an
artist
of
the
period

such
was
my
grandsire
his
only
son

the
heart
of
thaddeus

he
did
not
utter
the
words

the
enthusiastic
historiographer
of

was
so
seldom
called
to
touch
on
proceeded
without
a
pause
in
process
of
time
one
fair
scion
from
this
illustrious
stock
became
engrafted
on
our
former
royal
stem
i
mean
her
highness
the
lady
clementina
the
daughter
of
prince
james
of

who
after
his
rejection
of
all
foreign
aid
to
him
in
his
kingdom
had
like
the
abdicated
monarch
of

gone
about
a

the
two
families
auspiciously
met
to

beauteous
daughter
to
give
her
nuptial
hand
to
the

so
most
remarkably
was
united
the
equally
extraordinary
destinies
of
the
regal

of
the
heroic
john

with
that
of

almost
breathless
attention
to
this
part
of
the
narrative
some
of
its
public

having
found
a
dim

always
turned

to
the
chivalrous
nation
of
his
own
parentage
and
from
which
a
desertion
had
expatriated
him
even
before
his
birth
but
now
how
ample
had
been
the
atonement
the
restitution
to
this
forsaken
son
not
being
able
to
express
any
of
the
kindled
feelings

narration
had

to
the
daily

the
blessing
of
such
an
atonement

hourly
making
on
his

mary
irradiating

the

soul
then
at

feet
gently
breathed
her
ardent
felicitations
at
what
she
had
just
heard
which
had
indeed
established
her
kindred
with
the
venerated
friend
whose
kindness
had
met
her
so
unreservedly
as
a
stranger
when
the
little
party
so
signally
brought
together
to
become
mutually
entwined
as
if
already
known
to
each
other
for
years
instead
of
minutes
when
they
became
composed
after
the
excited
emotions
of
the
disclosure
had
subsided
the
reverend
host
now
considering
the
count
and

rather
as
young
cousins
to
be
honored
than
as
guests
to
be
entertained
conversed
awhile
more
particularly
with
regard
to
the
marquis
and
his
family
and
finally
accepted
with
declared
pleasure
the
earnest
invitation
of
his
gladly
responsive
new
relatives
to
accompany
them
the
following
day
when
they
would
call
for
him
in
their
carriage
to
dine
with
their
dearest
guardian
and
parental
friend
sir
robert
somerset
he
is
my
mary
maternal
uncle
remarked
thaddeus
with
a
calm
emphasis
and
has
been
to
me
as
a
father
in
this
her
adopted
land
i
found
a
brother
also
in
his
admirable
son

with
his
young

you
will
meet
at
sir

hence
my

for

arrived
the
count
called
for
his
friend
who
was
ready
at
the

rectory
mansion
and
after
much
interesting
conversation
during
the
drive
conducted
him
into
the
presence
of
the
baronet
sir
robert
greeted
his
guest
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
filial
eloquence
of
sobieski
in
describing
his
adopted
father
heart
and
consequent
benignant
manners
thaddeus
had
repeated
to
sir
robert
the
revealments
of
yesterday
visit
to
the
honorable
and
reverend
rector
of
paul
which
had
so
stirringly
mingled
with
his
own
most
cherished
memories
the
cordial
reception
thus
given
to
the
revered
narrator
gratified
him
as
a
full
repayment
for
his
imparted
confidence
of
the
day
before
though
he
could
not
be
aware
of
the
real
paternal
fountain
from
which
these
warm
welcomes
flowed
but
thaddeus
recognized
it
in
every
word
look
and
act
of
his
beloved
father
and
with
his
mother
in
his
heart
he
appreciated
all
cavendish

been
added
to

an
recollection
of
the
past

spread
the

the
former
whenever
he
might
have
leisure
to
enrich
it
with
his
highly
intellectual
store

the
preceding
evening
with

also
possess
the

of
the

given
him
a
frank
greeting
of
relationship
on

being
presented
to
her
as
mistress
of
her
brother
house
on
his
first
entrance
into
the
drawing
room
during
the
social
repast
much
elegant
and
intellectual

took
place
and
promises
were
solicited

then
and
after
the
banquet
by
the
members
of
the

from
their
several
guests
for
visits
at
the
seasons
most
pleasant
to
themselves
to
deerhurst
to
somerset
and
to
beaufort
the
venerable

his
young
nephew
were
particularly
besought
by
thaddeus
and
his
mary
who
anticipated
a
peculiar
delight
in
becoming
intimately
acquainted
with
that
interesting
boy
lord

they
hoped
might
prove
a
companionable
attraction
to

cordially
accepted
the

should
be
assembled
including
somerset

moved

tempering
shade

time
passed
on
in
the
alternate
interchanges
of
domestic
tranquillity
and
the
active
exercises
of
those

to

in

and
to
the
important

were
made

we
leave
thaddeus
sobieski
now
one
of
its
most
beloved
members
blessed
in
the
fruition
of
every
earthly
good
the
virtues
the
muses
and
the
charities
were
the
chosen
guests
at
his
abundant
table
poverty
could
not
veil
genius
from
his
penetration
nor
misfortune
obscure
the
inborn
light
of
its
integrity
though
exiled
from
his
native
land
where
his
birth
gave
him
dominion
over
rich
territories
now
in
the
hands
of
strangers
and
a
numerous
happy
people
now
no
more
he
had
not
yet
relinquished
the
love
of
empire
but
it
was
not
over
principalities
and
embattled
hosts
that
he
desired
to
prolong
the
sceptre
of
command
he
wished
to
reign
in
the
soul
his
throne
was
sought
in
the
hearts
of
the
good
the
kind
the
men
of
honest
industry
and
the
unfortunate
on
whom
prosperity
had
frowned
in
fact
the
unhappy
of
every
degree
and
nation
found
consolation
refuge
and
repose
within
the
sheltering
domains
of
beaufort
no
eye
looked
wistfully
on
him
to
turn
away
disappointed
his
smiles
cheered
the
disconsolate
and
his
protecting
arms
warded
off
when
possible
the
approach
of
new
sorrows
peace
was
within
his
walls
and
plenteousness
within
his
palaces
and
when
a
few
eventful
months
of
the
succeeding
year
had
distinguished
its
course
with
the
death
of
the
imperious
destroyer
of
poland
and
general
kosciusko
having
been
set
at
liberty
by
her
generous
successor
and
honorably
empowered
to
go
whither
he
willed
had
arrived
in
england
on
his
way
to
the
united
states
he
sought
and
found
thaddeus
his
young
comrade
in
the
fields
of
poland
and
was
hailed
with
the
warmest
welcome
by
that
now
indeed
truly
comforted
brave
and
last
representative
of
the
noble
race
and
name
of
the
glory
of
his
country
the
more
than
once
of
christendom
john
sobieski
ah
my
chief
cried
he
while
he
clasped
the
veteran
to
his
breast
i
am
indeed
favored
above
mortals
i
see
thee
again
on
whom
i
believed
the
gates
of
a
ruthless
prison
had
closed
forever
i
have
all
that
remains
of
my
country
now
within
my
arms
kosciusko
my
friend
my
father
bless
your
son
kosciusko
did
bless
him
and
embalmed
the
benediction
with
a
shower
of
tears
more
precious
than
the
richest
unction
that
ever
flowed
on
a
royal
head
they
were
drawn
from
a
christian
soldier
heart
a
true
patriot
and
a
hero
sobieski
presented
his
lovely
wife
to
this
illustrious
friend
and
while
he
gratefully
acknowledged
the
rare
felicity
of
his
ultimate
fate
he
owned
that
the
retrospection
of
the
past
calamity
like
a
shade
in
a
picture
gives
to
our
present
bliss
greater
force
and
brightness
but
that
such
felicity
was
his
he
could
only
ascribe
to
the
gracious
providence
of
god
who
trieth
the
spirit
of
man
and
can
bring
him
to
a
joy
on
earth
even
like
unto
a
resurrection
from
the
dead
and
the
conclusion
is
not
even
then
there
remaineth
yet
a
better
life
and
a
better
country
for
those
who
trust
in
the
lord
of
earth
and
heaven
appendix
notes
chiefly
relating
to
general
kosciusko
notes
the
writer
prefaces
these
notes
with
the
following
dedicatory
tribute
she
inscribed
to
the
memory
of
this
illustrious
chief
in
a
former
but
subsequent
edition
some
years
after
the
first
publication
of
the
work
it
runs
thus
thaddeus
of
warsaw
this
tenth
edition
is
humbly
and
affectionately
inscribed
to
the
memory
of
the
late
justly
revered
and
renowned
general
thaddeus
kosciusko
the
spirit
of
war
between
nation
and
nation
and
between
man
and
man
in
those
nations
for
public
supremacy
on
the
one
side
and
private
aggrandizement
on
the
other
being
still
as
much
the
character
of
the
times
as
in
the
days
when
the
preceding
biographical
tale
of
poland
was
written
the
author
continues
to
feel
the
probable
consequences
of
such
a
crisis
in
forming
the
future
principles
of
manly
british
youth
a
feeling
which
was
the
origin
of
the
work
itself
its
direct
aim
being
to
draw
a
distinguishing
line
between
the
spirit
of
true
patriotism
and
that
of
ambitious
public
discontent
between
real
glory
which
arises
from
benefits
bestowed
and
the
false
fame
of
acquired
conquests
which
a
leader
of
banditti
has
as
much
right
to
arrogate
as
would
the
successful
invader
of
kingdoms
the
character
of
general
kosciusko
under
these
views
presented
itself
to
the
writer
as
the
completest
exemplar
for
such
a
picture
enthusiasm
attempted
to
supply
the
pencil
of
genius
and
though
the
portraiture
be
imperfectly
sketched
yet
its
author
has
been
gratified
by
the
sympathy
of
readers
not
only
of
her
own
people
but
of
those
of
distant
nations
and
that
the
principles
of
heroic
virtue
which
she
sought
to
inculcate
in
her
narrative
were
pronounced
by
its
great
patriot
subject
in
a
letter
he
addressed
to
herself
worthy
of
his
approbation
and
esteem
seems
now
that
he
is
removed
from
all
earthly
influence
to
sanction
her
paying
that
honest
homage
to
his
memory
which
delicacy
forbade
her
doing
while
he
lived
the
first
publication
of
this
work
was
inscribed
to
a
british
hero
land
commander
and
a
tar
whose
noble
nature
well
deserved
the
title
bestowed
upon
it
by
his
venerable
sovereign
george
he
a
brother
in
spirit
fully
appreciated
the
character
of
thaddeus
kosciusko
and
the
writer
of
this
devoted
tribute
feels
that
she
deepens
the
tints
of
honor
on
each
name
by
thus
associating
them
together
but
may
the
tomb
of
the
british
hero
be
long
in
finding
its
place
that
of
the
polish
patriot
has
already
received
its
sacred
deposit
and
with
the
sincere
oblation
of
a
not
quite
stranger
heart
this
poor
offering
is
laid
on
the
grave
of
him
who
fought
for
country
freedom
laws
and
native
king
who
when
riches
and
a
crown
were
proffered
to
himself
by
the
then
dictator
of
almost
all
europe
declined
both
because
no
price
could
buy
the
independence
of
an
honest
man
such
was
general
kosciusko
such
was
the
model
of
disinterestedness
of
tempered
valor
and
of
public
virtue
which
his
annalist
sought
to
set
forth
in
the
foregoing
pages
such
was
the
man
who
honored
their
narrator
with
his
approval
and
esteem
and
in
that
last
word
she
feels
a
privilege
but
with
due
humility
to
thus
link
some
little
memorial
of
herself
to
after
times
by
so
uniting
to
the
name
of
thaddeus
kosciusko
that
of
his
humble
but
sincere
aspirer
to
such
themes

since
the
above
inscription
was
first
written
and
inscribed
in
the
former
edition
the
brave
and
benign
christian
knight
the
of
our
own
times
has
also
been
gathered
to
the
tears
of
his
country
and
his
monumental
statue
as
if
standing
on
the
victorious
mount
of

is
now
preparing
to
be
set
up
with
its
appropriate
sacred
trophies
in
the
great
naval
hall
at

it
is

mortal
remains
will
be
removed
from
the
pere
la

in
paris
where
they
now
lie
to
finally
rest
in
cathedral
where
nelson
sleeps
kosciusko
tomb
is
at
cracow
the
ancient
capital
of
poland
and
in
the
manner
of
its
most
ancient
style
of
sepulchre
it
appears
an
immense
earthen
tumulus
piled
over
the
grave
which
accumulating
portions
were
severally
borne
to
their
hallowed
place
in
the
arms
alone
of
each
silent
mourner
in
a
certain
number
of
successive
days
till
the
whole
was
raised
into
a
grand
pyramidal
mass
in
looking
back
through
the
avenue
of
life
to
those
periods
the
tale
tells
of
what
events
have
occurred
public
and
private
to
the
countries
and
the
individuals
referred
to
in
these
memoranda
to
persons
of
lofty
names
and
excellence
both
in
our
own
and
in
other
lands
mutually
affected
with
admiration
and
regret
for
the
virtues
and
the
calamities
described
it
is
an
awful
contemplation
and
in
sitting
down
in
my
now
solitary
chamber
to
its
retrospection
i
find
that
nearly
half
a
century
has
passed
since
its
transactions
swept
over
europe
like
a
desolating
blast
then
i
wrote
my
little
chronicle
when
the
birthright
independence
of
poland
was
no
more
when
she
lay
in
her
ashes
and
her
mighty
men
were
trodden
into
the
dust
when
the
pall
of
death
overspread
the
country
and
her
widows
and
her
orphans
wandered
afar
into
the
trackless
wilderness
of
a
barren
world
during
this
wide
expatriation
some
distinguished
captives
who
had
fallen
in
the
field
and
were
counted
among
the
slain
having
been
found
by
the
victors
alive
in
their
stiffened
blood
were
conveyed
to
various
prisons
and
along
with
these
was
discovered
the
justly
feared
and
not
less
justly
deplored
general
kosciusko
who
though
long
unheard
of
by
the
lone
wanderers
of
his
scattered
host
had
been
thus
preserved
by
the
supreme
lord
of
all
to
behold
again
a
remnant
of
his
own
brightened
in
hope
and
comforted
by
the
honoring
sympathy
of
the
good
and
brave
in
many
nations
kosciusko
was
of
noble
birth
and
early
distinguished
himself
by
his
spirit
and
talents
for
the
martial
field
indeed
owing
to
the
belligerent
position
of
poland
situated
in
the
midst
of
jealous
and
encroaching
nations
arms
was
the
natural
profession
of
every
gentleman
in
the
kingdom
commerce
and
agriculture
being
the
usual
pursuits
of
the
middle
classes
but
it
happened
in
the
early
manhood
of
thaddeus
kosciusko
that
the
dangerous
political
stromboli
which
surrounded
his
country
and
often
aroused
an
answering
blaze
in
that
since
devoted
land
slept
in
their
fires
and
poland
being
at
peace
her
young
military
students
becoming
desirous
of
practising
their
science
in
some
actual
campaign
resolved
to
try
their
strength
across
the
atlantic
hearing
of
the
war
then
just
commenced
between
the
british
colonies
in
america
and
the
mother
country
kosciusko
as
a
deciding
spirit
amongst
his
ardent
associates
brought
them
to
this
resolution
losing
no
time
they
embarked
passed
over
the
wide
ocean
of
the
western
world
and
landing
safe
and
full
of
their
object
offered
their
services
to
the
army
of
independence
having
been
readily
accepted
and
immediately
applied
to
use
the
extraordinary
warrior
talents
of
kosciusko
soon
shone
conspicuous
and
were
speedily
honored
by
his
being
appointed
special
to
general
washington
his
subsequent
conduct
in
the
camp
and
field
was
consonant
to
its
beginning
and
he
became
a
distinguished
general
in
rank
and
command
long
before
his
volunteered
military
services
had
terminated
when
the
war
ended
in
the
peace
of
mutual
concessions
between
the
national
parent
and
its
children
on
a
distant
land
a
point
that
is
the
duty
of
all
christian
states
to
consider
and
to
measure
their
ultimate
conduct
by
the
poles
returned
to
their
own
country
where
they
soon
met
circumstances
which
caused
them
to
call
forth
their
recently
passed
experience
for
her
but
they
had
not
departed
from
the
american
state
without
demonstrations
of
its
warm
gratitude
and
koscuisko
in
particular
with
his
not
less
popular
compatriot
and
friend
niemcivitz
the
soldier
and
the
poet
bore
away
with
them
the
pure
esteem
of
the
brave
population
the
sighs
of
private
friendship
and
the
tears
of
an
abiding
regret
from
many
fair
eyes
to
recapitulate
the
memorable
events
of
the
threatened
royal
freedom
of
poland
by
the
three
formidable
foreign
powers
confederated
for
its
annihilation
and
in
repelling
which
general
kosciusko
took
so
gallant
a
lead
is
not
here
necessary
to
connect
our
memoranda
concerning
his
unreceding
struggles
to
maintain
her
political
existence
they
have
already
been
sketched
in
the
preceding
little
record
of
the
actual
scenes
in
which
he
and
his
equally
devoted
compeers
held
their
indomitable
resistance
till
the
fatal
issue
sarmatia
lay
in
blood
and
the
portion
of
that
once
great
bulwark
of
civilized
europe
was
adjudged
by
the
paricidal
victors
to
themselves
a
sentence
like
unto
that
passed
on
the
worst
of
criminals
was
thus
denounced
against
christendom
often
best
benefactor
while
the
rest
of
europe
stood
silently
by
paralyzed
or
appalled
during
the
immediate
execution
of
the
noble
victim
but
though
dismembered
and
thrown
out
from
the
map
of
nations
by
the
combination
of
usurping
ambition
and
broken
faith
and
no
longer
to
be
regarded
as
one
in
its
proud
cordon
poland
retained
within
herself
as
has
been
well
observed
by
a
contemporary
writer
a
mode
of
existence
unknown
till
then
in
the
history
of
the
world
a
domestic
national
vitality
unknown
we
may
venture
to
say
except
in
one
extraordinary
yet
easily
and
reverentially
understood
instance
we
mean
the
sense
of
an
integral
national
being
living
in
the
bosoms
of
the
people
of
israel
throughout
all
their
different
dispersions
and
captivities
and
perhaps
with
respect
to
this
principle
of
a
moral
political
and
filial
life
still
drawing
its
aliment
from
the
inhumed
heart
of
their
who
to
them
is
not
dead
but
sleepeth
may
be
explained
in
some
degree
in
reference
to
the
above
remark
on
the
existing
and
individual
feeling
amongst
the
wanderers
of
poland
by
considering
some
of
the
best
effects
latent
in
their
working
together
for
good
in
the
deep
experience
of
her
ancient
modes
of
civil
government
under
that
of
her
early
monarchs
the
piasts
and
their
senate
she
sat
beneath
an
almost
patriarchal
sceptre
they
being
native
and
truly
parental
princes
john
sobieski
was
one
of
this
description
by
descent
and
just
rule
under
the
jagellon
dynasty
also
sprung
from
the
soil
she
held
a
yet
more
generalizing
constitutional
code
after
which
she
gradually
adopted
certain
republican
forms
with
an
elective
king
a
strange
contradiction
in
the
asserted
object
a
sound
system
for
political
freedom
but
which
in
fact
contained
the
whole
alchemy
of
a
nation
anarchical
life
and
ultimately
produced
the
entire
destruction
of
the
state
from
the
established
date
of
the
elective
monarchy
the
kingdom
became
an
arena
for
every
species
of
ambitious
rivalry
and
its
sure
consequences
the
interference
of
foreign
influences
and
hence
rapidly
advanced
the
decline
of
the
true
independent
spirit
of
the
land
to
stand
in
her
laws
and
in
her
own
political
strength
her
own
impartial
laws
the
palladium
of
the
people
and
a
native
king
the
parental
guardian
of
their
just
administration
but
in
sad
process
of
time
strangers
of
rome
of
gaul
and
of
other
nations
in
whose
veins
not
a
drop
of
sclavonian
blood
flowed
found
means
to
successively
seat
themselves
on
the
throne
of
the
piasts
the
jagellons
and
the
sobieskis
of
ancient
sarmatia
and
the
revered
fabric
fell
as
by
an
earthquake
to
be
registered
no
more
amongst
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
the
early
education
of
kosciusko
and
his
compatriots
with
its
subsequent
effects
on
the
principles
of
their
lives
though
their
country
appeared
thus
lost
to
them
they
felt
its
kingdom
still
in
their
minds
in
the
bosom
of
memory
in
the
consciousness
of
an
ancestry
of
bravery
and
of
virtue
and
though
the
soil
had
passed
away
from
the
feet
of
those
whose
ancestors
of
sword
or
share
had
trod
it
as
sons
and
owners
and
it
now
holds
no
place
for
them
but
their
fathers
graves
yet
the
root
is
deep
in
such
planting
and
the
tree
though
invisible
to
the
world
is
seen
and
nourished
in
the
depths
of
their
hearts
by
the
dews
of
heaven
the
pages
of
universal
history
sacred
and
profane
ancient
and
modern
when
opened
with
the
conviction
that
he
who
made
the
world
governs
it
also
will
best
explain
the
of
these
changes
in
the
destiny
of
nations
and
within
half
of
the
latter
part
of
the
last
century
and
the
nearly
half
of
the
present
awful
have
been
the
pages
to
be
read
hence
we
may
understand
the
vital
influence
of
the
objects
of
education
with
regard
to
the
principles
inculcated
whether
with
relation
to
individual
interest
or
to
the
generalized
consideration
of
a
people
as
a
commonwealth
or
a
kingdom
a
kingdom
and
a
commonwealth
may
be
considered
the
same
thing
when
the
power
of
both
people
and
king
are
limited
by
just
laws
established
by
the
long
exercised
wisdom
of
the
nation
holding
the
whole
powers
of
the
state
in
equilibrium
and
in
this
sense
meaning
a
royal
commonwealth
comprising
as
in
england
kings
lords
and
commons
it
is
generally
believed
is
intended
to
be
understood
the
term
the
republic
of
poland
with
its
king
the
polish
nation
however
under
all
their
dominions
of
government
usually
partook
something
of
the
policies
and
manners
of
the
then
existing
times
yet
they
were
always
distinguished
by
a
particular
chivalry
of
character
a
brave
freedom
from
all
foreign
and
domestic
vassalage
and
a
generous
disposition
to
respect
and
to
assist
the
neighboring
nations
to
maintain
the
same
independence
they
themselves
enjoyed
though
actual
schools
or
colleges
or
written
lore
might
not
originally
have
had
much
to
do
with
it
the
continued
practice
of
old
customs
held
them
in
the
ways
their
fathers
walked
in
and
they
found
them
those
of
pleasantness
and
true
honor
but
the
time
came
when
literary
dictation
was
to
take
the
place
of
oral
tradition
and
of
habitual
imitative
reverence
of
the
past
schools
and
colleges
were
instituted
teaching
for
doctrines
the
prevailing
sentiments
of
the
endowers
or
of
the
instructors
employed
during
the
reigns
of
the
later
sovereigns
of
the
jagellon
dynasty
sigismund
and
and
that
of
their
predecessor
john
sobieski
the
principles
of
these
seminaries
might
be
considered
sound
but
soon
after
the
death
of
the
monarch
when
the
latent
mischief
contained
in
the
utopian
idea
of
the
perfection
of
an
always
elective
monarchy
began
to
shake
the
stability
of
even
the
monarchy
itself
certain
of
the
public
teachers
evinced
correspondent
signs
of
this
destructive
species
of
freemasonry
and
about
the
same
period
the
voltaire
venom
of
infidelity
against
all
the
laws
of
god
and
man
being
poured
throughout
the
whole
civilized
world
the
general
effect
had
so
banefully
reached
the
seats
of
national
instruction
in
poland
that
several
of
the
most
venerated
personages
whose
names
have
already
been
commemorated
in
the
preceding
biographical
story
congregated
together
to
stem
by
a
counteracting
current
the
torrent
where
they
saw
it
likely
to
overflow
to
sap
up
its
introduced
sources
by
obtaining
the
abolition
of
some
of
the
most
subtle
and
dangerous
of
the
scholastic
institutions
and
the
establishment
of
others
in
their
room
on
the
sound
foundation
of
moral
and
religious
polity
between
men
and
nations
the
sole
remaining
princely
descendants
of
the
three
just
referred
to
true
were
the
earliest
awakened
to
resist
the
spirit
of
evil
spreading
amongst
all
classes
in
the
nation
the
czartoryski
and
the
zamoyski
race
both
of
the
jagellon
line
and
near
kinsmen
to
the
then
newly
raised
monarch
to
the
polish
throne
stanislaus
poniatowski
appeared
like
twin
stars
over
the
darkened
field
and
the
whole
aspect
of
the
country
seemed
speedily
changed
a
contemporary
writer
bears
record
that
one
hundred
and
provincial
colleges
were
founded
perfected
and
supported
by
them
and
their
patriotic
colleagues
while
the
university
of
vilna
was
judiciously
and
munificently
organized
by
its
prince
palatine
adam
czartoryski
himself
and
a
statute
drawn
up
which
declared
it
an
open
from
the
supreme
board
of
public
education
for
all
the
polish
provinces
herein
was
every
science
exalting
to
the
faculties
of
man
and
conducive
to
his
sacred
aspirations
seriously
and
diligently
inculcated
and
every
principle
of
morality
and
religion
purifying
to
his
mixed
nature
and
therefore
calculated
to
establish
him
in
the
answering
conduct
truth
justice
and
loyal
obedience
to
the
hereditary
revered
laws
of
the
nation
equally
instilled
qualifying
him
to
uphold
them
and
to
defend
their
freedom
from
all
offensive
operations
at
home
or
abroad
intended
to
subvert
the
purity
of
their
code
or
the
integrity
of
their
administration
such
was
the
import
of
the
implied
vow
on
entering
the
university
amongst
the
gallant
youths
brought
up
in
such
a
school
of
public
virtue
was
thaddeus
kosciusko
and
the
young
timotheus
niemcivitz
his
friend
from
youth
to
age
kosciusko
as
has
already
been
said
was
of
noble
parentage
and
to
be
the
son
of
a
polish
nobleman
was
to
be
born
a
soldier
and
its
practical
education
with
sabre
and
lance
his
daily
pastime
but
military
studies
were
included
in
these
various
colleges
and
the
friends
soon
became
as
mutually
expert
in
arms
as
they
ever
after
continued
severally
distinguished
in
the
fields
of
their
country
with
sword
or
lyre
besides
neither
of
the
young
cavaliers
passed
quite
away
from
their
without
having
each
received
the
completing
accolade
of
true
knighthood
by
the
stroke
of
fealty
to
honor
from
the
inaugurating
sunbeam
of
some
lovely
woman
eye
such
befell
the
youthful
kosciusko
one
bright
evening
in
a
large
and
splendid
circle
of
the
beautiful
and
brave
at
vilna
and
it
never
lessened
its
full
rays
in
his
chivalric
heart
from
that
hour
devoted
to
the
unknown
who
had
shed
them
on
him
and
who
had
seemed
to
doubly
consecrate
the
ardors
of
his
soul
to
his
country
her
country
the
country
of
all
he
loved
and
honored
upon
earth
how
he
wrought
out
this
silent
vow
is
a
story
of
deep
interest
equally
faithful
to
his
patriotic
loyalty
and
to
his
love
and
in
some
subsequent
reminiscences
of
the
hero
should
the
writer
live
to
touch
a
polish
theme
again
they
may
be
related
with
additional
honor
to
his
memory
brief
was
the
time
after
the
preceding
sealing
scene
of
the
young
kosciusko
for
his
military
vocation
took
place
before
himself
and
his
friend
niemcivitz
who
had
also
received
his
anointing
spell
which
he
gayly
declared
came
by
more
bright
eyes
than
he
would
dare
whisper
to
their
possessors
made
a
joint
arrangement
to
quit
the
study
of
arms
though
thus
cheered
on
by
the
muses
and
the
graces
and
at
once
enter
the
exercise
in
some
actual
field
of
rugged
war
the
dispute
between
great
britain
and
her
colonies
in
north
america
seemed
calculated
for
their
honorable
practice
consulting
some
of
their
most
respected
friends
they
speedily
found
means
to
cross
the
seas
and
shared
the
first
great
campaign
under
washington
the
issue
of
that
campaign
and
those
which
followed
it
need
not
be
repeated
here
suffice
it
to
say
the
contest
ended
in
a
treaty
of
peace
between
the
parent
country
and
its
contumacious
offspring
in
the
year
with
acknowledgment
of
their
independence
under
the
name
of
the
united
states
of
america
the
two
gallant
poles
returned
to
europe
and
onward
to
their
own
country
by
a
route
tracked
by
former
brave
deeds
through
france
germany
and
other
lands
marked
by
the
gustavuses
the
montecuculi
the
turennes
the
condes
the
marlboroughs
the
eugenes
champions
alike
of
national
peace
and
national
glory
on
those
plains
and
bulwarked
frontiers
till
the
belligerent
clouds
of
a
still
more
threatening
hostility
than
any
of
those
repelled
invasions
were
seen
hovering
luridly
over
their
own
beloved
country
warned
thus
during
their
pleasant
travel
of
the
coming
events
whose
shadows
seemed
to
rise
on
every
side
of
poland
in
forms
appalling
to
the
luxurious
the
avaricious
the
indolently
selfish
of
every
description
in
the
land
but
which
only
roused
and
nerved
the
hearts
and
arms
of
her
two
sons
courageous
in
the
simplicity
of
their
purpose
poland
preservation
they
hastened
in
that
moment
to
her
bosom
the
events
of
this
her
mortal
struggle
in
fast
union
with
these
faithful
sons
and
other
filial
hearts
commemorated
in
the
foregoing
narrative
of
thaddeus
sobieski
need
not
be
recapitulated
here
it
amply
tells
the
fate
of
the
great
kingdom
which
had
stood
as
with
gates
of
brass
until
the
intestine
rivalries
of
an
elective
monarchy
the
worshipped
idol
alike
of
presumptuous
private
ambition
and
pretended
patriotic
liberality
the
true
masked
priest
of
public
anarchy
rent
them
asunder
and
the
watchful
nations
ready
for
plunder
and
extended
dominion
poured
into
them
a
flood
like
the
rivers
of
babylon
over
all
her
walls
and
towers
we
have
read
that
part
of
her
bravest
sons
were
swept
away
into
distant
lands
some
to
die
in
homeless
exile
others
to
meet
the
honorable
compassion
and
the
cheering
hopes
of
sympathy
from
a
people
like
themselves
who
had
formerly
fought
the
good
fight
for
laws
liberties
and
royal
name
in
europe
and
some
were
shut
up
from
the
light
of
day
in
the
fettered
captivity
of
foreign
prisons
until
the
iron
entered
their
souls
amongst
these
noble
captives
were
general
kosciusko
and
his
faithful
achates
niemcivitz
to
whom
might
be
justly
applied
the
words
of
our
bard
of
the
seasons
affixed
to
the
young
brow
of
sir
philip
sidney
the
plume
of
war
with
early
chaplets
the
hero
laurel
with
the
poet
bays
but
the
emperor
paul
on
his
accession
to
the
throne
of
the
czars
as
has
before
been
noted
was
too
generous
a
captor
to
hold
in
cage
so
sweet
a
singing
bird
and
so
noble
a
lion
and
he
gave
them
liberty
appending
to
the
act
dearest
to
a
heart
an
imperial
donation
to
kosciusko
that
might
have
furnished
him
with
a
golden
argosy
all
over
the
world
but
the
wounded
son
of
poland
declined
it
in
a
manner
worthy
her
name
and
with
an
ingenuous
gratitude
towards
the
munificent
sovereign
who
had
offered
it
not
as
a
bribe
for
golden
opinions
but
as
a
sincere
tribute
to
high
heroic
virtue
the
writer
of
this
note
was
informed
of
this
fact
many
years
ago
by
a
celebrated
english
banker
at
that
time
at
petersburg
and
corresponding
between
that
city
and
london
with
whom
the
imperial
present
had
been
lodged
and
through
whom
general
kosciusko
respectfully
but
decidedly
declined
its
acceptance
then
it
was
that
after
halting
a
short
time
in
england
he
with
his
school
and
camp
companion
in
so
many
changes
prepared
a
second
crossing
over
the
atlantic
to
revisit
its
victor
president
in
his
at
mount
vernon
but
niemcivitz
had
another
errand
his
roving
cupid
had
long
settled
its
wing
and
he
eagerly
sought
to
plight
before
heaven
altar
in
the
church
the
already
sacred
vow
he
had
pledged
to
a
fair
daughter
of
that
country
while
sharing
the
dangers
of
its
battlefields
it
was
with
great
difficulty
the
portcullis
of
a
friendship
strong
as
death
had
been
raised
in
old
chivalric
kent
to
allow
departure
to
so
dear
and
honored
a
guest
as
he

remembrances
there
were
other
friends
of
olden
days
who
had
welcomed
him
with
gladdening
recollections
amongst
these
was
the
family
of
vanderhorst
originally
of
the
spanish
netherlands
who
from
religious
rather
than
political
motives
had
transferred
themselves
from
certain
persecutions
in
that
land
during
times
of
papal
tyranny
to
the
shelter
of
the
british
colonies
on
the
transatlantic
shore
and
who
on
the
separation
of
those
colonies
into
independent
states
from
the
mother
country
had
removed
in
relative
grateful
duties
to
the
governing
land
of
their
early
refuge
and
were
now
dwelling
here
in
prosperity
and
happy
repose
when
general
kosciusko
set
his
honored
foot
on
its
and
coast
he
was
their
former
guest
while
at
new

and
he
readily
accepted
their
eager
invitation
that
he
would
revisit
them
in
their
new
paternal
country
at
this
period
the
head
of
the
respected
family
resided
at
bristol
in
queen

opulent
city

with
glittering
over

joyous
smiles
greeted
every
one
with
the
affectionate
recognition
of
a
heart
that
seemed
to
know
only
to
love
the
writer
for
one
shall
never
forget
those
tears
and
smiles
on
that
venerable
but
ever
kindly
face
yet
it
was
only
in
his
old
age
that
i
first
knew
him
but
sweet
sisters
whom
i
began
to
know
in
your
bright
bloom
i
can
never
forget
those
charming
looks
of
reciprocating
welcome
that
sprang
alone
from
the
fulness
of
a
good
and
truthful
virgin
heart
they
are
now
before
me
though
the
eyes
which
then
beamed
so
ingenuously
on
the
honored
countenance
of
the
polish
hero
are
closed
in
death
or
rather
shall
i
say
on
him
in
a
fairer
and
light
he
spent
a
happy
week
in
that
bright
circle
in
which
the

commemorator
has
often

moved

heard

honoring

crowds
of

in

thronged

and
on
each
succeeding
day
while
he
remained
at

similar

congregated
in

to
catch

him
the

attended
every
evening
in

a
soldier

had
waved
but
letters
arrived
from
mount
vernon
general
washington
had
become
impatient
for
his
expected
guest
and
the
morning
of
his
separation
from
his
bristol
friends
was
fixed
the
vessel
in
which
he
was
to
embark
was
inspected
with
scrupulous
care
and
from
the
state
of
some
of
his
yet
unhealed
wounds
he
was
obliged
to
be
conveyed
from
queen
square
to
the
quay
in
a
vanderhorst
and
his
son
preceded
it
on
foot
and
two
military
officers
captains
whorwood
and
ferguson
walked
on
each
side
each
with
his
helmet
off
and
in
his
hand
resting
them
on
the
poles
of
the
sedan
as
they
moved
along
the
colonel
and
other
personal
friends
of
vanderhorst
and
admirers
of
his
followed
in
the
rear
of
the
chair
and
a
respectful
and
rank
and
file
of
humbler
station
closed
the
procession
to
the
waterside
there
he
embarked
in
a
boat
with
a
sail
and
rudder
a
more
precious
freight
than
caesar
and
his
fortunes
for
the
roman
general
crossed
a
to
subvert
his
country
thaddeus
kosciusko
a
stream
of
refuge
after
having
sacrificed
his
all
though
in
vain
to
preserve
the
independence
of
his
native
land
and
thus
the
welcomed
coming
speeded
parting
guest
took
a
grateful
leave
of
the
party
who
escorted
him
they
had
seen
him
comfortably
placed
in
the
boat
and
when
it
had
put
off
he
and
niemcivitz
uncapped
extended
their
handkerchiefs
fluttering
in
the
breeze
to
them
and
the
other
bystanders
as
the
little
sail
gave
bosom
to
the
wind
and
the
farewell
of
this
salution
was
answered
with
the
warm
and
hearted
cheers
of
old
british
custom
and
the
waving
of
hats
which
propitious
sounds
echoed
back
from
cliff
to
cliff
of
the
superb
vincent
rocks
that
rampart
the
keys
of
the
bristol
avon
all
along

villas
that
adorned
its
banks
by
pretty
bringing
votive
presents
of
fruits
and
flowers
to
the
brave
voyagers
on
board
and
then
while
the
wounded
and
fatigued
veteran
as
he
lay
on
his
pallet
on
the
deck
was
only
able
to
bow
his
head
with
a
gracious
accepting
smile
to
the
respectful
messengers
niemcivitz
stood
at
the
prow
his
then
bright
locks
dallying
with
the
sweet
zephyrs
from
the
gardened
shores
and
spoke
the
general
and
his
own
heartfelt
thanks
in
a
language
of
poetry
that
best
accorded
with
his
own
glowing
and
his
gallant
feelings
and
the
generous
of
the
fair
donators
onward
the
little
vessel
sped
until
it
reached
the
american
ship
afloat
in
king
road
to
convey
its
two
noble
passengers
to

new
republic
just
established
in
the
western
hemisphere
that
the
remembered
of
its
boasted
hero
washington
was
received
with
warrior
honors
need
not
be
here
described
he
rested
that
night
under
the
variegated
flag
streaming
from
the
topmast
head
which
his
own
volunteer
arm
had
assisted
to
place
there
and
he
thought
of
poland
and
of
england
till
he
glided
into
a
gentle
sleep
and
dreamed
of
both
by
the
following
letter
it
may
be
seen
that
his
eyes
were
visited
next
day
by
a
sweet
vision
in
real
personal
existence
of
the
same
kind
beings
whose
recollections
alone
had
so
blandly
soothed
his

but
without

however
establishing
it
to
have
been
written
on
or
about
the
or
june
dear
sir
it
is
the
subject
for
a
drama
only
where
the
actors
can
express
with
the
action
and
words
what
may
approach
nearest
to
what
was
passed
yesterday
within
us
that
i
try
to
write
we
were
highly
pleased
it
is
true
and
with
uncommon
satisfaction
to
see
the
approach
of
your
family
in
a
boat
to
our
ship
but
how
short
was
the
duration
of
the
pleasure
when
separation
took
place
our
hearts
were
melted
in
tears
and
we
were
frightened
at
their
return
with
fears
of
what
might
happen
to
them
upon
a
high
sea
in
so
small
a
boat
every
rising
wave
gave
the
greatest
pain
to
our
anxiety
and
the
extreme
painfulness
of
our
alarm
even
increased
when
we
were
so
far
off
that
we
could
not
see
them
more
i
must
beg
of
you
to
give
them
a
good
reprimand
their
kind
and
sensible
hearts
passed
the
limits
of
safety
for
themselves
and
gave
us
the
most
distressful
emotions
of
soul
the
sea
was
so
rough
i
am
sure
they
must
all
be
very
sick
however
we
send
them
the
warmest
thanks
with
everlasting
friendship
and
remembrance
be
pleased
also
to
take
for
yourself
our
tender
respects
never
shall
i
forget
so
kind
reception
of
me
in
your
house
nor
the
attentions
of
your
friends
i
am
sensible
that
i
gave
to
you
and
your
amiable
family
a
great
trouble
but
your
goodness
will
not
acknowledge
it
and
by
so
doing
it
more
impresses
my
mind
with
the
obligation
and
with
a
true
answering
affection
for
your
whole
family
i
am
dear
sir
with
friendship
and
esteem
your
most
thankful
and
most
obedient
servant
t
kosciusko
i
can
nothing
add
to
the
feelings
of
my
worthy
friend
but
that
i
wish
to
the
respectable
and
beautiful
family
of
vanderhorst
all
the
happiness
that
virtue
and
the
most
excellent
qualities
of
the
heart
can
deserve
niemcivitz
the
fair
deity
i
mean
mister
cupid
desires
his
best
compliments
to
you
all
this
tender
yet
playful
postscript
from
the
young
soldier
votary
of
cupid
and
the
muse
is
evidently
appended
in
the
gayety
of
an
affectionate
heart
speeding
to
the
land
of
his
own
shortly
to
become
his
bride
after
his
arrival
and
which
was
so
consummated
kosciusko
never
swerved
from
his
soul
loyalty
to
the
bright
polish
laura
of
his
cherished
devotedness
and
his
subsequent
correspondence
one
of
pure
unselfish
friendship
with
the
youngest
daughter
of
his
venerable
friend
lovely
as
she
was
pure
confided
to
her
how
faithful
had
been
his
heart
allegiance
to
the
woman
of
his
first
and
last
vows
they
had
met
during
his
track
of
early
military
fame
and
had
exchanged
these
vows
but
blighting
circumstances
interfered
and
they
lived
and
loved
but
never
met
again
the
narrator
of
these
little
reminiscences
might
well
perhaps
most
agreeably
drop
the
curtain
here
for
strange
and
stirring
incidents
awaited
the
two
friends
on
their
return
to
europe
after
a
rather
prolonged
sojourn
amongst
the
animated
hospitalities
of
a
grateful
people
the
homeward
side
of
that
curtain
was
wrought
in
mingled
fabric

threaded
yarns

were
the
different

that
threw

but
above
all
in
the
depth
of
mischief
the
spirit
of
suspicion
had
steeped
the
web
such
was
the
lurid
appearance
of
the
great
drama
of
europe
when
kosciusko
and
niemcivitz
set
foot
again
upon
its
shores
death
had
thrown
his
pall
over
some
in
high
places
and
others
in
low

more
cheering
suns
soon
arose

scare
away
the

ascended

them
how
some
were
honored
some
deceived
in

observance
need
not
lengthen
out
our

suffice
it
to
say
that
there
were
stars
then
rising
on
the
horizon
which
promised
fairer
elements
it
may
be
recollected
that
at
the
signing
of
the
partition
of
poland
by
the
benumbed
senate
on
the
fatal
day
of
its
political
decease

had
been
so
signal
a

to

country
by
the
endowment
and
reformation
of
its

schools
was
sent
out
a
hostage
to

of

the

caused

instantly
removed
by

given
freedom
to

its
bland

over

ere
long
the
scene
changed
and
the
of
a
universal
ambition
the
crucible
of
nations
grasped
by
the
hand
of
napoleon
began
again
to
darken
the
world
atmosphere
kosciusko
now
looked
on
sometimes
with
yet
struggling
hopes
then
with
convictions
that
the
doom
was
not
yet
spent
and
no
more
to
be
deluded
one
way
or
another
while
such
shifting
grounds
and
sudden
earthquakes
were
erupting
the
earth
under
his
feet
like
the
prophet
of
old
boding
worse
things
to
come
he
withdrew
himself
far
into
the
solitudes
of
nature
into
the
wide
yet
noiseless
temple
of
god
where
the
prayer
of
an
honest
man
heart
might
be
heard
and
answered
by
that
and
being
who
sometimes
leaves
proud
men
to
themselves
to
the
lawless
headlong
driving
of
their
arrogant
passions
to
show
them
in
the
due
turn
of
events
what
a
vicious
abhorrent
and
despicable
monster
in
human
shape
such
a
noble
creature
when
turned
from
the
divine
purpose
of
his
creation
may
become
to
such
contemplations
and
to
the
repose
of
a
mind
and
conscience
at
peace
with
itself
did
the
once

hero
of

retire
into
the
most
sequestered
mountains
of
switzerland
a
few
friends
of
the
same
closed
accounts
with
the
world
congregated
around
him
and
there
he
dwelt
several
years
beloved
and
revered
as
indeed
he
was
wherever
he
planted
his
pilgrim
staff
he
died
at
soleure
in
the
house
of
a
friend
zeltner
in
consequence
of
a
fall
from
his
horse
while
taking
a
solitary
ride
he
was
buried
there
with
every
demonstration
of
respect
in
the
power
of
the
simple
inhabitants
to
bestow
but
the
emperor
alexander
on
hearing
of
the
event
would
not
allow
remains
so
honorable
to
be
divided
from
the
land
of
their
birth
and
such
high
and
sincere
homage
to
the
undaunted
heroism
and
universally
acknowledged
integrity
of
the
lamented
dead
found
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
distinguishing
object
sought
that
of
transferring
his
consecrated
relics
to
the
shrine
of
ancient
christian
poland
the
city
of
cracow
and
there
reinterring
them
in
the
great
royal
cemetery
of
the
most
revered
patriots
of
the
kingdom
years
rolled
on
over
the
head
and
heart
of
the
patriot
and
the
bard
niemcivitz
the
ever
faithful
achates
of
his
friend
and
his
country
even
after
to
his
bereaved
heart
he
had
survived
both
he
had
also
become
a
widower
his
gentle
and
delicate
wife
went
to
revisit
her
native
climate
in
the
united
states
but
died
there
on
his
return
thence
to
europe
the
consolations
of
a
fraternal
friendship
in
the
bosoms
of
his
noble
countrymen
who
had
become
adopted
denizens
of
free
and
happy
england
vainly
sought
to
retain
him
with
them
sorrow
in
a
breast
of
his
temperament
can
not
find
rest
in
any
place
his
shining
locks
once
likened
to
those
of
hyperion
became
frosted
by
an
age
of
wandering
as
well
as
of
sadness
and
the
till
then
joyous
and
heart
of
the
sweetest
poet
of
sclavonian
birth
breathed
its
last
sigh
in
paris
in
the
summer
of
it
was
on
the
first
of
june
and
on
the
eighth
of
the
month
he
was
buried
with
military
honors
and
all
the
distinguishing
rites
of
the
national
church
the
funeral
service
was
performed
by
the
archbishop
of
chalcidonia
with
a
large
body
of
the
clergy
attending
a
choir
of
fifty
professors
sung
the
mass
and
more
than
a
thousand
persons
thronged
the
procession
persons
of
all
nations
of
all
creeds
religious
or
political
of
every
rank
amongst
men
of
every
mind
from
the
prince
to
the
peasant
that
understood
the
true
value
of
genius
when
helmed
by
virtue
either
on
the
land
or
on
the
wave
whether
in
the
field
or
in
the
cabinet
in
the
student
closet
or
in
the
duties
of
domestic
home
such
a
man
was
niemcivitz
so
was
he
wept
so
will
he
be
remembered
proving
indeed
most
convincingly
that
there
is
a
standard
set
up
in
men
hearts
if
they
would
but
look
to
it
which
whatever
be
their
minor
clashing
opinions
shows
that
the
truly
great
and
good
in
this
earth
are
all
of
one
family
in
the
estimation
of
pure
intellect
the
spiritual
organ
of
all
just
estimation
which
is
in
fact
that
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
that
kingdom
which
if
its
laws
to
man
were
properly
preserved
and
obeyed
would
spread
the
shepherds
promised
peace
and
to
all
mankind
but
men
may
listen
approve
and
admire
and
yet
withhold
obedience
but
why
will
the
heirs
of
such
a
covenant
with
sight
and
hearing
die
from
its
inheritance
kosciusko
and
niemcivitz
were
real
appreciators
of
so
rich
a
birthright
in
the
better
country
and
now
are
gone
to
him
who
purchased
it
by
his
most
precious
blood
to
enter
with
him
forever
into
its
peaceful
and
glorious
rest
