the
principal

of

life
up

the
news
of
his
death
from
cancer
at
stockholm
on
may
has
been
reported
of
the
plays
included
in
the
present
volume
the
father
and
countess
julie
are
representative
of
strindberg
high
water
mark
in
dramatic
technique
and
have
successfully
maintained
their
claim
to
a
permanent
place
not
only
in
dramatic
literature
but
as
acting
plays
the
stronger
than
which
no
better
example
of
strindberg
uncanny
power
for
analysis
of
the
female
mind
exists
while
essentially
a
chamber
play
is
from
time
to
time
presented
at
the
theatre
and
affords
a
splendid
test
of
the
dramatic
ability
of
the
actors
only
one
of
whom
speaks
the
author
has
boldly
thrown
on
the
other
the
burden
of
maintaining
her
share
in
the
development
of
the
action
by
pantomime
facial
expression
and
an
occasional
laugh
the
outlaw
although
inferior
in
construction
to
the
others
is
still
played
with
success
and
is
full
of
dignity
and
atmosphere
the
important
part
it
played
in
promoting
the
fortunes
of
the
author
lends
to
it
an
added
interest
which
fully
justifies
its
inclusion

must
have
chaos

you
if
you
would
give
birth
to
a
dancing
nietzsche
in
stockholm
living
almost
as

august
strindberg

the
dancing
stars
sprung
from
the
chaos
of
his
being
shine
with
an
refulgence
from
the
dome
of
dramatic
literature
but
he
no
longer
adds
to
their
number
the
constellation
of
the
lion
of
the
north
is
complete
at
worn
by
the
emotional
intensity
of
a
life
into
which
has
been
crowded
the
stress
and
storm
of
a
universe
he
sits
at
his
desk
every
day
transcribing
to
his
diary
a
record
of
those
mystical
forces
which
he
says
regulate
his
life
before
him
lies
a
crucifix
hardly
as
a
symbol
of
sectarian
faith
for
strindberg
is
a
swedenborgian
but
a
fitting
accompaniment
nevertheless
to
a
state
of
mind
which
he
expresses
in
saying
one
gets
more
and
more
humble
the
longer
one
lives
and
in
the
shadow
of
death
many
things
look
different
a
softer
light
beams
from
those
blue
eyes
which
under
that
tossing
crown
of
tawny
hair
flung
high
from
a
speaking
forehead
in
times
past
flashed
defiance
at
every
opposition
for
him
the
fierce
unyielding
strife
of
mind
and
unrest
of
life
is
passing
an
eddy
in
the
tide
has
borne
him
into
quieter
waters
and
if
the
hum
of
the
world
reaches
his
solitude
it
no
longer
rouses
him
to
headlong
action
secure
in
his
position
as
the
foremost
man
of
letters
sweden
has
produced
in
modern
times
the
last
representative
of
that
distinguished
group
of
scandinavian
writers
which
included
ibsen
bjornson
and
brandes
with
a
continental
reputation
surpassing
that
of
any
one
of
them
strindberg
well
may
be
entitled
to
dream
of
the
past
one
day
when
in
the
evolution
of
the
drama
strindberg
technique
shall
have
served
its
purpose
and
like
ibsen
be
forced
to
give
way
before
the
advance
of
younger
artists
when
his
most
radical
views
shall
have
become
the
commonplaces
of
the
scientific
psychologist
will
take
the
man
in
hand
and
from
the
minute
record
of
his
life
emotions
thoughts
fancies
speculations
and
nightmares
which
he
has
embodied
in
autobiographical
novels
and
that
most
remarkable
perhaps
of
all
his
creations
abysmal
in
its
pessimism
the
inferno
will
be
drawn
a
true
conception
of
the
man
that
the
individual
will
prove
quite
as
interesting
a
study
as
his
literary
work
even
the
briefest
outline
of
strindberg
life
will
suggest
the
lack
of
harmony
in
his
soul
that
has
permeated
his
life
and
work
with
theses
and
antitheses
strindberg
tries
to
explain
through
heredity
a
by
no
means
satisfying
or
complete
solution
for
the
motivation
of
his
frequently
unusual
conduct
and
exceptional
temperamental
qualities
which
the
abnormal
psychologist
is
in
the
habit
of
associating
with
that
not
inconsiderable
group
of
cases
in
which
the
emotional
and
temperamental
characteristics
of
the
opposite
sex
are
dominant
in
the
individual
his
ancestry
has
been
traced
back
to
the
sixteenth
century
when
his
father
family
was
of
the
titled
aristocracy
later
generation
after
generation
becoming
churchmen
although
father
carl
oscar
undertook
a
commercial
career
his
mother
ulrica
eleanora
norling
was
the
daughter
of
a
poor
tailor
whom
father
first
met
as
a
waitress
in
a
hotel
and
falling
in
love
with
her
married
after
she
had
borne
him
three
children
august
christened
johann
august
the
fourth
child
was
born
at
stockholm
january
soon
after
his
father
had
become
a
bankrupt
there
was
little
light
or
cheer
in
the
boy
home
the
misfortune
that
overtook
the
family
at
the
time
of
august
birth
always
hung
over
them
like
a
dark
cloud
the
mother
became
nervous
and
worn
from
the
twelve
she
survived
the
father
serious
and
reserved
the
children
were
brought
up
strictly
and
as
august
was
no
favorite
loneliness
and
hostility
filled
even
his
earliest
years
his
first
school
days
were
spent
among
boys
of
the
better
class
who
turned
up
their
noses
at
his
leather
breeches
and
heavy
boots
he
was
taken
away
from
that
school
and
sent
where
there
was
a
lower
class
of
boys
whose
leader
he
soon
became
but
in
his
studies
he
was
far
from
precocious
though
not
dull
as
he
grew
up
the
family
fortunes
bettered
and
he
attended
a
private
school
patronized
by
cultivated
and
wealthy
people
mixing
so
with
both
classes
meant
much
in
the
development
of
the
youth
and
he
began
to
realize
that
he
belonged
to
both
and
neither
felt
homeless
torn
in
his
sympathies
and
antipathies
plebian
and
aristocratic
at
the
same
time
in
his
thirteenth
year
his
mother
died
a
loss
for
which
his
father
was
apparently
soon
consoled
as
in
less
than
a
year
he
married
his
housekeeper
this
was
another
blow
to
the
boy
for
he
disliked
the
woman
and
there
was
soon
war
between
them
at
fifteen
he
fell
in
love
with
it
woman
of
thirty
of
very
religious
character
and
its
this
was
a
period
of
fervent
belief
with
the
youth
himself
she
became
an
influence
in
his
life
for
home
time
but
one
day
a
young
comrade
asked
him
to
luncheon
at
a
cafe
and
for
the
first
time
strindberg
partook
of
schnaps
and
ale
with
a
hearty
meal
this
little
luncheon
was
the
event
which
broke
up
the
melancholy
introspection
of
his
youth
and
stirred
him
to
activity
he
went
to
upsala
university
for
one
term
and
then
left
partly
on
account
of
the
lack
of
funds
for
books
and
partly
because
the
slow
pedantic
methods
of
learning
were
distasteful
to
his
restless
active
nature
he
then
became
a
school
teacher
next
interested
in
medical
science
which
he
studied
energetically
until
the
realities
of
suffering
drove
him
from
it
about
this
time
the
same
time
by
the
way
that
ibsen
the
league
of
youth
was
being
hissed
down
at
christiana
the
creative
artist
in
strindberg
began
to
stir
and
after
six
months
more
of
turmoil
of
soul
he
turned
to
the
stage
as
a
possible
solution
making
his
debut
at
the
dramatiska
theatre
in
in
bjornson
mary
stuart
in
the
part
of
a
lord
with
one
line
to
speak
after
two
months
of
no
advancement
he
found
courage
to
ask
to
be
heard
in
one
of
the
classical
roles
he
had
been
studying
the
director
tired
from
a
long
rehearsal
reluctantly
consented
to
listen
to
him
likewise
the
bored
company
of
actors
strindberg
went
on
to
do
or
die
and
was
soon
shouting
like
a
revivalist
and
made
such
it
bad
impression
that
he
was
advised
to
go
to
the
dramatic
school
to
study
he
went
home
disgusted
and
heartsick
and
determined
to
take
his
life
swallowed
an
opium
pill
which
he
had
long
been
keeping
for
that
purpose
however
it
was
not
sufficiently
powerful
and
a
friend
coming
to
see
him
he
was
persuaded
to
go
out
and
together
they
drowned
his
chagrin
in
an
evening
at
it
caf√©
the
day
after
was
a
memorable
one
for
it
was
strindberg
birthday
as
a
dramatist
he
was
lying
on
a
sofa
at
home
his
body
still
hot
from
the
shame
of
his
defeat
and
wine
trying
to
figure
out
how
he
could
persuade
his
stepmother
to
effect
a
reconciliation
between
him
and
his
father
he
saw
the
scenes
played
as
clearly
as
though
on
a
stage
and
with
his
brain
working
at
high
pressure
in
two
hours
had
the
scheme
for
two
acts
of
a
comedy
worked
out
in
four
days
it
was
finished
strindberg
first
play
it
was
refused
production
but
he
was
complimented
and
felt
that
his
honor
was
saved
the
fever
of
writing
took
possession
of
him
and
within
two
months
he
had
finished
two
comedies
and
a
tragedy
in
verse
called
hermione
which
was
later
produced
giving
so
much
promise
as
a
dramatist
he
was
persuaded
to
leave
the
stage
and
unwilling
of
spirit
returned
to
upsala
in
the
spring
of
as
he
was
advised
that
he
would
never
be
recognized
as
a
writer
unless
he
had
secured
is
university
degree
the
means
with
which
to
continue
his
studies
were
derived
from
the
two
hundred
crowns
left
him
by
his
mother
which
he
now
forced
his
father
to
allow
him
to
use
despite
this
however
his
fortunes
often
ran
to
the
lowest
ebb
one
day
strindberg
announced
that
he
had
a
one
act
play
called
in
rome
to
read
to
the
runa
song
club
a
group
of
six
students
whom
he
had
gotten
together
and
which
was
devoted
exclusively
to
the
reading
of
the
poetry
of
its
members
the
play
based
upon
an
incident
in
the
life
of
thorvaldsen
was
received
enthusiastically
by
the
runa
and
the
rest
of
the
night
was
spent
in
high
talk
of
strindberg
future
over
a
champagne
supper
in
his
honor
given
by
one
of
the
members
these
days
of
homage
and
appreciation
from
this
student
group
strindberg
cherishes
as
the
happiest
time
in
his
life
but
notwithstanding
their
worshipful
attitude
he
himself
was
full
of
doubts
and
misgivings
about
his
abilities
one
of
these
friends
sent
the
manuscript
of
in
rome
to
the
dramatiska
theatre
at
stockholm
where
it
was
accepted
and
produced
anonymously
in
august
of
the
same
year
strindberg
was
present
at
the
premiere
and
although
it
was
well
received
to
him
it
was
all
a
fine
occasion
except
the
play
he
was
ashamed
of
his
in
it
and
fled
before
the
final
curtain
he
soon
finished
another
play
the
outlaw
which
is
included
in
the
present
volume
in
this
drama
which
retains
a
high
place
among
his
plays
strindberg
shows
for
the
first
time
his
lion
claw
and
in
it
began
to
speak
with
his
own
voice
it
was
accepted
by
the
court
theatre
at
stockholm
for
production
during
the
next
autumn
that
of
at
the
close
of
the
summer
after
a
violent
quarrel
with
his
father
he
returned
to
the
university
in
the
hope
of
finding
help
from
his
comrades
arrived
at
upsala
with
just
one
crown
he
found
that
many
of
his
old
and
more
prosperous
friends
were
no
longer
there
times
were
harder
than
ever
but
at
last
a
gleam
of
hope
came
with
the
news
that
the
outlaw
was
actually
to
be
produced
and
his
wildest
dreams
were
then
realized
for
despite
the
unappreciative
attitude
of
the
critics
toward
this
splendid
viking
piece
the
king
carl
xv
after
seeing
the
play
commanded
strindberg
to
appear
before
him
strindberg
regarded
the
summons
as
the
perpetration
of
a
practical
joke
and
only
obeyed
it
after
making
sure
by
telegraph
that
it
was
not
a
hoax
strindberg
tells
of
the
kindly
old
king
standing
with
a
big
pipe
in
his
hand
as
the
young
author
strode
between
chamberlains
and
other
court
dignitaries
into
the
royal
presence
the
king
a
grandson
of
napoleon
marshal
bernadotte
and
as
a
frenchman
on
the
throne
of
sweden
diplomatic
enough
to
desire
at
least
the
appearance
of
being
more
swedish
than
the
swedes
spoke
of
the
pleasure
the
ancient
viking
spirit
of
the
outlaw
had
given
him
and
after
talking
genially
for
some
time
said
you
are
the
son
of
strindberg
the
steamship
agent
i
believe
and
so
of
course
are
not
in
need
quite
the
reverse
strindberg
replied
explaining
that
his
father
no
longer
gave
him
the
meager
help
in
his
university
course
which
he
had
formerly
done
how
much
can
you
get
along
on
per
annum
until
you
graduate
asked
the
king
strindberg
was
unable
to
say
in
a
moment
i
rather
short
of
coin
myself
said
the
king
quite
frankly
but
do
you
think
you
could
manage
on
eight
hundred
riksdaler
a
year
strindberg
was
overwhelmed
by
such
munificence
and
the
interview
was
concluded
by
his
introduction
to
the
court
treasurer
from
whom
he
received
his
first
quarter
allowance
of
two
hundred
crowns
full
of
thankfulness
for
this
unexpected
turn
of
fate
the
young
dramatist
returned
to
upsala
for
once
he
appeared
satisfied
with
his
lot
and
took
up
his
studies
with
more
earnestness
than
ever
the
year
closed
brilliantly
for
the
young
writer
for
in
addition
to
the
kingly
favor
be
received
honorable
mention
from
the
swedish
academy
for
his
greek
drama
hermione
the
following
year
life
at
the
university
again
began
to
pall
on
his
restless
mind
and
he
took
to
painting
then
followed
a
serious
disagreement
with
one
of
the
professors
so
that
when
he
received
word
from
the
court
treasurer
that
it
was
uncertain
whether
his
stipend
could
be
continued
on
account
of
the
death
of
the
king
he
decided
to
leave
the
university
for
good
at
a
farewell
banquet
in
his
honor
he
expressed
his
appreciation
of
all
he
had
received
from
his
student
friends
saying
a
personality
does
not
develop
from
itself
but
out
of
each
soul
it
comes
in
contact
with
it
sucks
a
drop
just
as
the
bee
gathers
its
honey
from
a
million
flowers
giving
it
forth
eventually
as
its
own
strindberg
went
to
stockholm
to
become
a
literateur
and
if
possible
a
creative
artist
he
gleaned
a
living
from
newspaper
work
for
a
few
months
but
in
the
summer
went
to
a
fishing
village
on
a
remote
island
in
bothnia
bay
where
in
his
year
he
wrote
his
great
historical
drama
master
olof
breaking
away
from
traditions
and
making
flesh
and
blood
creations
instead
of
historical
skeletons
in
this
play
it
was
refused
by
all
the
managers
of
the
theatres
who
assured
strindberg
that
the
public
would
not
tolerate
any
such
unfamiliar
methods
strindberg
protested
and
defended
and
tried
to
elucidate
his
realistic
handling
of
the
almost
sacred
historical
personages
but
in
vain
for
master
olof
was
not
produced
until
seven
years
later
when
it
was
put
on
at
the
swedish
theatre
at
stockholm
in
the
year
ibsen
was
writing
ghosts
at
sorrento
in
after
a
year
or
two
of
unsuccessful
effort
to
make
a
living
in
various
employments
he
became
assistant
at
the
court
library
which
was
indeed
a
haven
of
refuge
a
position
providing
both
leisure
for
study
and
an
assured
income
finding
in
the
library
some
chinese
parchments
which
had
not
been
catalogued
he
plunged
into
the
study
of
that
language
a
treatise
which
he
wrote
on
the
subject
won
him
medals
from
various
learned
societies
at
home
as
well
as
recognition
from
the
french
institute
this
success
induced
the
many
other
treatises
that
followed
for
which
he
received
a
variety
of
decorations
and
along
with
the
honors
nearly
brought
upon
himself
a
salubrious
idiocy
to
use
his
own
phrase
then
something
happened
that
stirred
the
old
higher
voice
in
him
he
fell
in
love
he
had
been
invited
through
a
woman
friend
to
go
to
the
home
of
baron
wrangel
where
his
name
as
an
author
was
esteemed
he
refused
the
invitation
but
the
next
day
walking
in
the
city
streets
with
this
same
woman
friend
they
encountered
the
baroness
wrangel
to
whom
strindberg
was
introduced
the
baroness
asked
him
once
more
to
come
he
promised
to
do
so
and
they
separated
as
friend
went
into
a
shop
he
turned
to
look
down
the
street
noting
the
beautiful
lines
of
the
disappearing
figure
of
the
baroness
noting
too
a
stray
lock
of
her
golden
hair
that
had
escaped
from
her
veil
and
played
against
the
white
ruching
at
her
throat
he
gazed
after
her
long
in
fact
until
she
disappeared
in
the
crowded
street
from
that
moment
he
was
not
a
free
man
the
friendship
which
followed
resulted
in
the
divorce
of
the
baroness
from
her
husband
and
her
marriage
to
strindberg
december
when
he
was
years
old
at
last
strindberg
had
someone
to
love
to
take
care
of
to
worship
this
experience
of
happiness
so
strange
to
him
revived
the
creative
impulse
the
following
year
master
olof
was
finally
accepted
for
publication
and
won
immediate
praise
and
appreciation
this
to
his
mind
belated
success
roused
in
strindberg
a
smoldering
resentment
which
lack
of
confidence
and
authority
of
position
had
heretofore
caused
him
to
repress
he
broke
out
with
a
burning
satire
in
novel
form
called
the
red
room
the
motto
of
which
he
made
voltaire
words
rien
si
d√©sagr√©able
que
pendu
obscur√©ment
hardly
more
than
mention
can
be
made
of
the
important
work
of
this
dramatist
poet
novelist
historian
scientist
and
philosopher
in
he
left
sweden
as
the
atmosphere
there
had
become
too
disagreeable
for
him
through
controversy
after
controversy
in
which
lie
became
involved
he
joined
a
group
of
painters
and
writers
of
all
nationalities
in
it
little
village
in
france
there
he
wrote
la
france
setting
forth
the
relations
between
france
and
sweden
in
olden
times
this
was
published
in
paris
and
the
french
government
tendered
him
the
decoration
of
the
legion
of
honor
which
however
he
refused
very
politely
explaining
that
he
never
wore
a
frock
coat
the
episode
ends
amusingly
with
the
publisher
a
swede
receiving
the
decoration
instead
in
the
first
volume
of
his
famous
short
stories
called
marriages
appeared
it
was
aimed
at
the
cult
that
had
sprung
up
from
ibsen
a
doll
house
which
was
threatening
the
peace
of
all
households
a
few
days
after
the
publication
of
marriages
the
first
edition
was
literally
swallowed
up
as
the
book
dealt
frankly
with
the
physical
facts
of
sex
relations
it
was
confiscated
by
the
swedish
government
a
month
after
its
publication
and
strindberg
was
obliged
to
go
to
stockholm
to
defend
his
cause
in
the
courts
which
he
won
and
in
another
month
marriages
was
again
on
the
market
the
next
year
his
real
utopias
was
written
in
switzerland
an
attack
in
the
form
of
four
short
stories
on
which
won
him
much
applause
in
germany
he
went
to
italy
as
a
special
correspondent
for
the
daily
news
of
stockholm
in
the
much
anticipated
second
volume
of
marriages
appeared
these
were
the
short
stories
satisfying
to
the
simplest
as
well
as
to
the
most
discriminating
minds
that
attracted
nietzsche
attention
to
strindberg
a
correspondence
sprung
up
between
the
two
men
referring
to
which
in
a
letter
to
peter
gast
nietzsche
said
strindberg
has
written
to
me
and
for
the
first
time
i
sense
an
answering
note
of
universality
the
mutual
admiration
and
intellectual
sympathies
of
these
two
conspicuous
creative
geniuses
has
led
a
number
of
critics
including
edmund
gosse
into
the
error
of
attributing
to
nietzsche
a
dominating
influence
over
strindberg
it
should
be
remembered
however
the
countess
julie
and
the
father
which
are
cited
its
the
most
obvious
examples
of
that
supposed
influence
were
completed
before
strindberg
acquaintance
with
nietzsche
philosophy
and
that
among
others
the
late
john
davidson
is
also
charged
with
having
drawn
largely
from
nietzsche
the
fact
is
that
during
the
last
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
most
original
thinkers
of
many
countries
were
quite
independently
though
less
clearly
evolving
the
same
philosophic
principals
that
the
master
mind
of
nietzsche
was
radiating
in
the
almost
blinding
flashes
of
his
genius
then
came
the
period
during
which
strindberg
attained
the
highest
peaks
of
his
work
the
years
with
his
autobiography
the
servant
woman
son
the
tragedies
the
father
and
countess
julie
the
comedies
comrades
and
the
stronger
and
the
the
creditors
and
simoon
of
these
the
father
and
countess
julie
soon
made
strindberg
name
known
and
honored
throughout
europe
except
in
his
home
country
in
the
father
perhaps
his
biggest
vision
is
felt
it
was
published
in
french
soon
after
it
appeared
in
sweden
with
an
introduction
by
zola
in
which
he
says
to
be
brief
you
have
written
a
mighty
and
captivating
work
it
is
one
of
the
few
dramas
that
have
had
the
power
to
stir
me
to
the
depths
of
his
choice
of
theme
in
countess
julie
strindberg
says
when
i
took
this
motive
from
life
as
it
was
related
to
me
a
few
years
ago
it
made
a
strong
impression
on
me
i
found
it
suitable
for
tragedy
and
it
still
makes
a
sorrowful
impression
on
me
to
see
an
individual
to
whom
happiness
has
been
allotted
go
under
much
more
to
see
a
line
become
extinct
and
in
defence
of
his
realism
he
has
said
further
in
his
preface
to
countess
julie
the
theatre
has
for
a
long
time
seemed
to
me
the
biblia
pauperum
in
the
fine
arts
a
bible
with
pictures
for
those
who
can
neither
read
nor
write
and
the
dramatist
is
the
revivalist
and
the
revivalist
dishes
tap
the
ideas
of
the
day
in
popular
form
so
popular
that
the
middle
class
of
whom
the
bulk
of
is
comprised
can
without
burdening
their
brains
understand
what
it
is
all
about
the
theatre
therefore
has
always
been
a
grammar
school
for
the
young
the
and
women
who
still
possess
the
primitive
power
of
being
able
to
delude
themselves
and
of
allowing
themselves
to
be
deluded
that
is
to
say
receive
illusions
and
accept
suggestions
from
the
dramatist
some
people
have
accused
my
tragedy
father
of
being
too
sad
as
though
one
desired
a
merry
tragedy
people
call
authoritatively
for
the
of
life
and
theatrical
managers
call
for
farces
as
though
the
joy
of
life
lay
in
being
foolish
and
in
describing
people
who
each
and
every
one
are
suffering
from
dance
or
idiocy
i
find
the
joy
of
life
in
the
powerful
terrible
struggles
of
life
and
the
capability
of
experiencing
something
of
learning
something
is
a
pleasure
to
me
and
therefore
i
have
chosen
an
unusual
but
instructive
subject
in
other
words
an
exception
but
a
great
exception
that
will
strengthen
the
rules
which
offend
the
apostle
of
the
commonplace
what
will
further
create
antipathy
in
some
is
the
fact
that
my
plan
of
action
is
not
simple
and
that
there
is
not
one
view
alone
to
be
taken
of
it
an
event
in
life
and
that
is
rather
a
new
discovery
is
usually
occasioned
by
a
series
of
more
or
less
motifs
but
the
spectator
generally
chooses
that
one
which
his
power
of
judgment
finds
simplest
to
grasp
or
that
his
gift
of
judgment
considers
the
most
honorable
for
example
someone
commits
suicide
business
says
the
citizen
love
says
the
woman
says
the
sick
man
hopes
the
bankrupt
but
it
may
be
that
none
of
these
reasons
is
the
real
one
and
that
the
dead
man
hid
the
real
one
by
pretending
another
that
would
throw
the
most
favorable
light
on
his
memory
in
the
following
drama
i
have
not
sought
to
do
anything
new
because
that
can
not
be
done
but
only
to
modernize
the
form
according
to
the
requirements
i
have
considered
people
require
following
the
mighty
output
of
those
years
in
strindberg
went
out
to
the
islands
where
he
had
lived
years
before
and
led
a
life
many
of
his
romantic
plays
were
written
there
and
much
of
his
time
was
spent
at
painting
in
he
was
divorced
from
his
wife
after
a
few
months
strindberg
went
to
berlin
where
he
was
received
with
all
honors
by
literary
germany
richard
dehmel
one
of
their
foremost
minstrels
celebrated
the
event
by
a
poem
called
an
immortal
to
germany
guest
in
the
shop
windows
his
picture
hung
alongside
that
of
bismarck
and
at
the
theatres
his
plays
were
being
produced
about
this
time
he
heard
of
the
commotion
that
countess
julie
had
created
in
paris
where
it
had
been
produced
by
antoine
during
these
victorious
times
strindberg
met
a
young
austrian
writer
frida
uhl
to
whom
he
was
married
in
april
although
the
literary
giant
of
the
hour
he
was
nevertheless
in
very
straightened
pecuniary
circumstances
which
led
to
his
allowing
the
publication
of
a
fool
confession
written
in
french
and
later
with
out
his
permission
or
knowledge
issued
in
german
and
swedish
which
entangled
him
in
a
lawsuit
as
the
subject
matter
contained
much
of
his
marital
miseries
interest
in
chemistry
had
long
been
stirring
in
strindberg
mind
it
now
began
to
deepen
about
this
time
also
he
passed
through
that
religious
crisis
which
swept
artistic
europe
awakened
nearly
a
century
after
his
death
by
that
swedenborgian
poet
and
artist
william
blake
to
this
period
belongs
to
damascus
a
play
of
deepest
soul
probing
which
was
not
finished
however
until
going
to
paris
in
the
fall
of
to
pursue
chemical
research
most
seriously
he
ran
into
his
own
success
at
the
theatres
there
the
creditors
had
been
produced
and
strindberg
was
induced
to
undertake
the
direction
of
the
father
at
the
theatre
de
where
it
was
a
tremendous
success
a
norwegian
correspondent
was
forced
to
send
word
home
that
with
the
father
strindberg
had
overreached
ibsen
in
paris
because
what
it
had
never
been
possible
to
do
with
an
ibsen
play
have
a
run
in
paris
they
were
now
doing
with
strindberg
at
the
same
time
the
the√¢tre
des
ecaliers
put
on
the
link
the
odean
produced
the
secret
of
the
guild
and
the
chat
noir
the
kings
of
heaven
and
translations
of
his
novels
were
running
in
french
periodicals
but
strindberg
turned
his
back
on
all
this
success
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
laboratory
to
delve
into
chemistry
this
he
did
with
such
earnestness
that
with
his
discovery
of
swedenborg
his
experimentations
and
speculations
reduced
him
to
a
condition
of
mind
that
unfitted
him
for
any
kind
of
companionship
so
that
when
his
wife
left
him
to
go
to
their
child
who
was
ill
and
far
away
he
welcomed
the
complete
freedom
strindberg
says
of
their
parting
at
the
railway
station
that
although
they
smiled
and
waved
to
each
other
as
they
called
out
auf
wiedersehen
they
both
knew
that
they
were
saying
good
bye
forever
which
proved
to
be
true
as
they
were
divorced
a
year
later
in
he
returned
to
sweden
so
broken
in
health
through
his
tremendous
wrestling
with
the
riddle
of
life
that
he
went
into
the
sanitorium
of
his
friend
aliasson
at
wstad
after
two
months
he
was
sufficiently
restored
to
go
to
austria
at
the
invitation
of
his
divorced
wife
family
to
see
his
child
then
back
to
sweden
to
lund
a
university
town
where
he
lived
solely
to
absorb
swedenborg
by
may
of
that
year
he
was
able
to
go
to
work
on
the
inferno
that
record
of
a
soul
nightmare
which
in
all
probability
will
remain
unique
in
the
history
of
literature
then
came
the
writing
of
the
great
historical
dramas
then
the
realistically
symbolic
plays
of
swedenborgian
spirit
of
which
easter
is
representative
and
the
most
popular
when
easter
was
produced
in
stockholm
a
young
norwegian
harriet
bosse
played
eleanora
the
psychic
and
in
this
young
actress
became
strindberg
wife
this
third
marriage
ended
in
divorce
three
years
later
in
the
actor
manager
august
folk
produced
countess
julie
in
stockholm
seventeen
years
after
it
had
been
written
to
strindberg
amazement
it
won
such
tremendous
attention
that
the
other
theatres
became
deserted
in
consequence
of
this
success
an
intimate
theatre
was
founded
for
the
production
of
none
but
strindberg
plays
how
he
is
estimated
today
in
his
own
country
may
be
judged
by
the
following
extract
from
an
article
which
appeared
in
a
recent
issue
of
the
leading
periodical
of
stockholm
for
over
thirty
years
he
has
dissected
us
from
every
point
of
view
during
that
time
his
name
has
always
been
conspicuous
in
every
window
and
his
books
gradually
push
out
the
others
from
our
shelves
every
night
his
plays
are
produced
at
the
theatres
every
conversation
turns
on
him
and
his
is
the
name
the
pigmies
quarrel
over
daily
the
cry
is
heard
that
he
has
become
hysterical
sentimental
out
of
his
mind
but
the
next
one
knows
he
is
robustness
itself
and
enduring
beyond
belief
despite
great
need
enmity
sorrow
one
hour
one
is
angry
over
some
extravagance
which
he
has
allowed
himself
the
next
captivated
by
one
of
his
plays
stirred
melted
strengthened
and
uplifted
by
his
sublime
genius

are
you
trying
to
put
the
blame
on
ludwig
is
that
what
you
are
up
to
n√∂jd
well
you
see
it
is
easy
to
know
who
is
to
blame
captain
yes
but
you
told
emma
you
would
marry
her
n√∂jd
oh
a
fellow
always
got
to
say
that
captain
to
pastor
this
is
terrible
is
it
pastor
it
the
old
story
over
again
see
here
n√∂jd
you
surely
ought
to
know
whether
you
are
the
father
or
not
n√∂jd
well
of
course
i
was
mixed
up
with
the
girl
but
you
know
yourself
pastor
that
it
need
amount
to
anything
for
all
that
pastor
look
here
my
lad
we
are
talking
about
you
now
surely
you
wo
leave
the
girl
alone
with
the
child
i
suppose
we
ca
compel
you
to
marry
her
but
you
should
provide
for
the
child
that
you
shall
do
n√∂jd
well
then
so
must
ludwig
too
captain
then
the
case
must
go
to
the
courts
i
can
not
ferret
out
the
truth
of
all
this
nor
is
it
to
my
liking
so
now
be
off
pastor
one
moment
n√∂jd
h
do
you
think
it
dishonorable
to
leave
a
girl
destitute
like
that
with
her
child
do
you
think
so
do
you
see
that
such
conduct
h
h
n√∂jd
yes
if
i
only
knew
for
sure
that
i
was
father
of
the
child
but
you
ca
be
sure
of
that
pastor
and
i
do
see
much
fun
slaving
all
your
life
for
another
man
child
surely
you
pastor
and
the
captain
can
understand
for
yourselves
captain
be
off
n√∂jd
god
save
you
captain
goes
captain
but
keep
out
of
the
kitchen
you
rascal
to
pastor
now
why
did
you
get
after
him
pastor
what
do
you
mean
captain
why
you
only
sat
and
mumbled
something
or
other
pastor
to
tell
the
truth
i
really
do
know
what
to
say
it
is
a
pity
about
the
girl
yes
and
a
pity
about
the
lad
too
for
think
if
he
were
not
the
father
the
girl
can
nurse
the
child
for
four
months
at
the
orphanage
and
then
it
will
be
permanently
provided
for
but
it
will
be
different
for
him
the
girl
can
get
a
good
place
afterwards
in
some
respectable
family
but
the
lad
future
may
be
ruined
if
he
is
dismissed
from
the
regiment
captain
upon
my
soul
i
should
like
to
be
in
the
magistrate
shoes
and
judge
this
case
the
lad
is
probably
not
innocent
one
ca
be
sure
but
we
do
know
that
the
girl
is
guilty
if
there
is
any
guilt
in
the
matter
pastor
well
well
i
judge
no
one
but
what
were
we
talking
about
when
this
stupid
business
interrupted
us
it
was
about
bertha
and
her
confirmation
was
it
captain
yes
but
it
was
certainly
not
in
particular
about
her
confirmation
but
about
her
whole
welfare
this
house
is
full
of
women
who
all
want
to
have
their
say
about
my
child
my
wants
to
make
a
spiritualist
of
her
laura
wants
her
to
be
an
artist
the
governess
wants
her
to
be
a
methodist
old
margret
a
baptist
and
the
want
her
to
join
the
salvation
army
it
wo
do
to
try
to
make
a
soul
in
patches
like
that
i
who
have
the
chief
right
to
try
to
form
her
character
am
constantly
opposed
in
my
efforts
and
that
why
i
have
decided
to
send
her
away
from
home
pastor
you
have
too
many
women
trying
to
run
this
house
captain
you
right
it
like
going
into
a
cage
full
of
tigers
and
if
i
did
hold
a
iron
under
their
noses
they
would
tear
me
to
pieces
any
moment
and
you
laugh
you
rascal
was
it
enough
that
i
married
your
sister
without
your
palming
off
your
old
stepmother
on
me
pastor
but
good
heavens
one
ca
have
stepmothers
in
one
own
house
captain
no
you
think
it
is
better
to
have
in
some
one
else
house
pastor
oh
well
we
all
have
some
burden
in
life
captain
but
mine
is
certainly
too
heavy
i
have
my
old
nurse
into
the
bargain
who
treats
me
as
if
i
ought
still
to
wear
a
bib
she
is
a
good
old
soul
to
be
sure
and
she
must
not
be
dragged
into
such
talk
pastor
you
must
keep
a
tight
rein
on
the
women
folks
you
let
them
run
things
too
much
captain
now
will
you
please
inform
me
how
i
to
keep
order
among
the
women
folk
pastor
laura
was
brought
up
with
a
firm
hand
but
although
she
is
my
own
sister
i
must
admit
she
pretty
troublesome
captain
laura
certainly
has
her
faults
but
with
her
it
is
so
serious
pastor
oh
speak
out
i
know
her
captain
she
was
brought
up
with
romantic
ideas
and
it
has
been
hard
for
her
to
find
herself
but
she
is
my
wife
pastor
and
because
she
is
your
wife
she
is
the
best
of
wives
no
my
dear
fellow
it
is
she
who
really
wears
on
you
most
captain
well
anyway
the
whole
house
is
laura
wo
let
bertha
leave
her
and
i
ca
allow
her
to
remain
in
this
bedlam
pastor
oh
so
laura
wo
well
then
i
afraid
you
are
in
for
trouble
when
she
was
a
child
if
she
set
her
mind
on
anything
she
used
to
play
dead
dog
till
she
got
it
and
then
likely
as
not
she
would
give
it
back
explaining
that
it
was
the
thing
she
wanted
but
having
her
own
way
captain
so
she
was
like
that
even
then
h
she
really
gets
into
such
a
passion
sometimes
that
i
am
anxious
about
her
and
afraid
she
is
pastor
but
what
do
you
want
to
do
with
bertha
that
is
so
unpardonable
ca
you
compromise
captain
you
must
think
i
want
to
make
a
prodigy
of
her
or
an
image
of
myself
i
do
want
to
be
it
procurer
for
my
daughter
and
educate
her
exclusively
for
matrimony
for
then
if
she
were
left
unmarried
she
might
have
bitter
days
on
the
other
hand
i
do
want
to
influence
her
toward
a
career
that
requires
a
long
course
of
training
which
would
be
entirely
thrown
away
if
she
should
marry
pastor
what
do
you
want
then
captain
i
want
her
to
be
it
teacher
if
she
remains
unmarried
she
will
be
able
to
support
herself
and
at
any
rate
she
would
be
any
worse
off
than
the
poor
schoolmasters
who
have
to
share
their
salaries
with
a
family
if
she
marries
she
can
use
her
knowledge
in
the
education
of
her
children
am
i
right
pastor
quite
right
but
on
the
other
hand
has
she
shown
such
talent
for
painting
that
it
would
be
a
great
pity
to
crush
it
captain
no
i
have
shown
her
sketches
to
an
eminent
painter
and
he
says
they
are
only
the
kind
of
thing
that
can
be
learned
at
schools
but
then
a
young
fop
came
here
in
the
summer
who
of
course
understands
the
matter
much
better
and
he
declared
that
she
had
colossal
genius
and
so
that
settled
it
to
laura
satisfaction
pastor
was
he
quite
taken
with
bertha
captain
that
goes
without
saying
pastor
then
god
help
you
old
man
for
in
that
case
i
see
no
hope
this
is
pretty
bad
and
of
course
laura
has
her
supporters
in
there
captain
yes
you
may
be
sure
of
that
the
whole
house
is
already
up
in
arms
and
between
ourselves
it
is
not
exactly
a
noble
conflict
that
is
being
waged
from
that
quarter
pastor
do
you
think
i
know
that
captain
you
do
pastor
i
do
captain
but
the
worst
of
it
is
it
strikes
me
that
bertha
future
is
being
decided
from
spiteful
motives
they
hint
that
men
better
be
careful
because
women
can
do
this
or
that
all
day
long
incessantly
it
is
a
conflict
between
man
and
woman
are
you
going
no
stay
for
supper
i
have
no
special
inducements
to
offer
but
do
stay
you
know
i
am
expecting
the
new
doctor
have
you
seen
him
pastor
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
as
i
came
along
he
looked
pleasant
and
reliable
captain
that
good
do
you
think
it
possible
he
may
become
my
ally
pastor
who
can
tell
it
depends
on
how
much
he
has
been
among
women
captain
but
wo
you
really
stay
pastor
no
thanks
my
dear
fellow
i
promised
to
be
home
for
supper
and
the
wife
gets
uneasy
if
i
am
late
captain
uneasy
angry
you
mean
well
as
you
will
let
me
help
you
with
your
coat
pastor
it
certainly
pretty
cold
tonight
thanks
you
must
take
care
of
your
health
adolf
you
seem
rather
nervous
captain
nervous
pastor
yes
you
are
not
really
very
well
captain
has
laura
put
that
into
your
head
she
has
treated
me
for
the
last
twenty
years
as
if
i
were
at
the
point
of
death
pastor
laura
no
but
you
make
me
uneasy
about
you
take
care
of
yourself
that
my
advice
old
man
but
did
you
want
to
talk
about
the
confirmation
captain
not
at
all
i
assure
you
that
matter
will
have
to
take
its
course
in
the
ordinary
way
at
the
cost
of
the
clerical
conscience
for
i
am
neither
a
believer
nor
a
martyr
pastor
love
to
laura
goes
the
captain
opens
his
desk
and
seats
himself
at
it
takes
up
account
books
captain
figuring
nine
seven
eight
laura
coming
in
from
inner
room
will
you
be
kind
enough
captain
just
a
moment
a
hundred
what
is
it
laura
am
i
disturbing
you
captain
not
at
all
housekeeping
money
i
suppose
laura
yes
housekeeping
money
captain
put
the
accounts
down
there
and
i
will
go
over
them
laura
the
accounts
captain
yes
laura
am
i
to
keep
accounts
now
captain
of
course
you
are
to
keep
accounts
our
affairs
are
in
a
precarious
condition
and
in
case
of
a
liquidation
accounts
are
necessary
or
one
is
liable
to
punishment
for
being
careless
laura
it
not
my
fault
that
our
affairs
are
in
a
precarious
condition
captain
that
is
exactly
what
the
accounts
will
decide
laura
it
not
my
fault
that
our
tenant
does
pay
captain
who
recommended
this
tenant
so
warmly
you
why
did
you
recommend
a
we
call
him
laura
but
why
did
you
rent
to
this
captain
because
i
was
not
allowed
to
eat
in
peace
nor
sleep
in
peace
nor
work
in
peace
till
you
women
got
that
man
here
you
wanted
him
so
that
your
brother
might
be
rid
of
him
your
mother
wanted
him
because
i
did
want
him
the
governess
wanted
him
because
he
reads
his
bible
and
old
margret
because
she
had
known
his
grandmother
from
childhood
that
why
he
was
taken
and
if
he
had
been
taken
i
be
in
a
madhouse
by
now
or
lying
in
my
grave
however
here
is
the
housekeeping
money
and
your
pin
money
you
may
give
me
the
accounts
later
laura
curtesies
thanks
so
much
do
you
too
keep
an
account
of
what
you
spend
besides
the
housekeeping
money
captain
that
does
concern
you
laura
no
that
true
just
as
little
as
my
child
education
concerns
me
have
the
gentlemen
come
to
a
decision
after
this
conference
captain
i
had
already
come
to
a
decision
and
therefore
it
only
remained
for
me
to
talk
it
over
with
the
one
friend
i
and
the
family
have
in
common
bertha
is
to
go
to
boarding
school
in
town
and
starts
in
a
fortnight
laura
to
which
boarding
school
if
i
may
venture
to
ask
captain
professor
s√§fberg
laura
that
free
thinker
captain
according
to
the
law
children
are
to
be
brought
up
in
their
father
faith
laura
and
the
mother
has
no
voice
in
the
matter
captain
none
whatever
she
has
sold
her
birthright
by
a
legal
transaction
and
forfeited
her
rights
in
return
for
the
responsibility
of
caring
for
her
and
her
children
laura
that
is
to
say
she
has
no
rights
concerning
her
child
captain
no
none
at
all
when
once
one
has
sold
one
goods
one
can
not
have
them
back
and
still
keep
the
money
laura
but
if
both
father
and
mother
should
agree
captain
do
you
think
that
could
ever
happen
i
want
her
to
live
in
town
you
want
her
to
stay
at
home
the
arithmetical
result
would
be
that
she
remain
at
the
railway
station
midway
between
train
and
home
this
is
a
knot
that
can
not
be
untied
you
see
laura
then
it
must
be
broken
what
did
n√∂jd
want
here
captain
that
is
an
official
secret
laura
which
the
whole
kitchen
knows
captain
good
then
you
must
know
it
laura
i
do
know
it
captain
and
have
your
judgment
laura
my
judgment
is
the
judgment
of
the
law
captain
but
it
is
not
written
in
the
law
who
the
child
father
is
laura
no
but
one
usually
knows
that
captain
wise
minds
claim
that
one
can
never
know
laura
that
strange
ca
one
ever
know
who
the
father
of
a
child
is
captain
no
so
they
claim
laura
how
extraordinary
how
can
the
father
have
such
control
over
the
children
then
captain
he
has
control
only
when
he
has
assumed
the
responsibilities
of
the
child
or
has
had
them
forced
upon
him
but
in
wedlock
of
course
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
fatherhood
laura
there
are
no
doubts
then
captain
well
i
should
hope
not
laura
but
if
the
wife
has
been
unfaithful
captain
that
another
matter
was
there
anything
else
you
wanted
to
say
laura
nothing
captain
then
i
shall
go
up
to
my
room
and
perhaps
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
let
me
know
when
the
doctor
arrives
closes
desk
and
rises
laura
certainly
captain
goes
through
the
primate
door
right
captain
as
soon
as
he
comes
for
i
do
want
to
seem
rude
to
him
you
understand
goes
laura
i
understand
looks
at
the
money
she
holds
in
her
hands
voice
within
laura
laura
yes
voice
is
my
tea
ready
laura
in
doorway
to
inner
room
in
just
a
moment
laura
goes
toward
hall
door
at
back
as
the
orderly
opens
it
orderly
doctor
ostermark
doctor
madam
laura
advances
and
offers
her
hand
welcome
doctor
you
are
heartily
welcome
the
captain
is
out
but
he
will
be
back
soon
doctor
i
hope
you
will
excuse
my
coming
so
late
but
i
have
already
been
called
upon
to
pay
some
professional
visits
laura
sit
down
wo
you
doctor
thank
you
laura
yes
there
is
a
great
deal
of
illness
in
the
neighborhood
just
now
but
i
hope
it
will
agree
with
you
here
for
us
country
people
living
in
such
isolation
it
is
of
great
value
to
find
a
doctor
who
is
interested
in
his
patients
and
i
hear
so
many
nice
things
of
you
doctor
that
i
hope
the
pleasantest
relations
will
exist
between
us
doctor
you
are
indeed
kind
and
i
hope
for
your
sake
my
visits
to
you
will
not
often
be
caused
by
necessity
your
family
is
i
believe
as
a
rule
in
good
health
laura
fortunately
we
have
bear
spared
acute
illnesses
but
still
things
are
not
altogether
as
they
should
be
doctor
indeed
laura
heaven
knows
things
are
not
as
might
be
wished
doctor
really
you
alarm
me
laura
there
are
some
circumstances
in
a
family
which
through
honor
and
conscience
one
is
forced
to
conceal
from
the
whole
world
doctor
excepting
the
doctor
laura
exactly
it
is
therefore
my
painful
duty
to
tell
you
the
whole
truth
immediately
doctor
should
we
postpone
this
conference
until
i
have
had
the
honor
of
being
introduced
to
the
captain
laura
no
you
must
hear
me
before
seeing
him
doctor
it
relates
to
him
then
laura
yes
to
him
my
poor
dear
husband
doctor
you
alarm
me
indeed
and
believe
me
i
sympathize
with
your
misfortune
laura
taking
out
handkerchief
my
husband
mind
is
affected
now
you
know
all
and
may
judge
for
yourself
when
you
see
him
doctor
what
do
you
say
i
have
read
the
captain
excellent
treatises
on
mineralogy
with
admiration
and
have
found
that
they
display
a
clear
and
powerful
intellect
laura
really
how
happy
i
should
be
if
we
should
all
prove
to
be
mistaken
doctor
but
of
course
it
is
possible
that
his
mind
might
be
affected
in
other
directions
laura
that
is
just
what
we
fear
too
you
see
he
has
sometimes
the
most
extraordinary
ideas
which
of
course
one
might
expect
in
a
learned
man
if
they
did
not
have
a
disastrous
effect
on
the
welfare
of
his
whole
family
for
instance
one
of
his
whims
is
buying
all
kinds
of
things
doctor
that
is
serious
but
what
does
he
buy
laura
whole
boxes
of
books
that
he
never
reads
doctor
there
is
nothing
strange
about
a
scholar
buying
books
laura
you
do
believe
what
i
am
saying
doctor
well
madam
i
am
convinced
that
you
believe
what
you
are
saying
laura
tell
me
is
it
reasonable
to
think
that
one
can
see
what
is
happening
on
another
planet
by
looking
through
a
microscope
doctor
does
he
say
he
can
do
that
laura
yes
that
what
he
says
doctor
through
a
microscope
laura
through
a
microscope
yes
doctor
this
is
serious
if
it
is
so
laura
if
it
is
so
then
you
have
no
faith
in
me
doctor
and
here
i
sit
confiding
the
family
secret
to
doctor
indeed
madam
i
am
honored
by
your
confidence
but
as
a
physician
i
must
investigate
and
observe
before
giving
an
opinion
has
the
captain
ever
shown
any
symptoms
of
indecision
or
instability
of
will
laura
has
he
we
have
been
married
twenty
years
and
he
has
never
yet
made
a
decision
without
changing
his
mind
afterward
doctor
is
he
obstinate
laura
he
always
insists
on
having
his
own
way
but
once
he
has
got
it
he
drops
the
whole
matter
and
asks
me
to
decide
doctor
this
is
serious
and
demands
close
observation
the
will
you
see
is
the
mainspring
of
the
mind
and
if
it
is
affected
the
whole
mind
goes
to
pieces
laura
god
knows
how
i
have
taught
myself
to
humor
his
wishes
through
all
these
long
years
of
trial
oh
if
you
knew
what
a
life
i
have
endured
with
him
if
you
only
knew
doctor
your
misfortune
touches
me
deeply
and
i
promise
you
to
see
what
can
be
done
i
pity
you
with
all
my
heart
and
i
beg
you
to
trust
me
completely
but
after
what
i
have
heard
i
must
ask
you
to
avoid
suggesting
any
ideas
that
might
make
a
deep
impression
on
the
patient
for
in
a
weak
brain
they
develop
rapidly
and
quickly
turn
to
monomania
or
fixed
ideas
laura
you
mean
to
avoid
arousing
suspicions
doctor
exactly
one
can
make
the
insane
believe
anything
just
because
they
are
receptive
to
everything
laura
indeed
then
i
understand
yes
yes
a
bell
rings
within
excuse
me
my
mother
wishes
to
speak
to
me
one
moment
ah
here
is
adolf
captain
comes
in
through
private
door
captain
oh
here
already
doctor
you
are
very
welcome
doctor
captain
it
is
a
very
great
pleasure
to
me
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
so
celebrated
a
man
of
science
captain
oh
i
beg
of
you
the
duties
of
service
do
not
allow
me
to
make
any
very
profound
investigations
but
i
believe
i
am
now
really
on
the
track
of
a
discovery
doctor
indeed
captain
you
see
i
have
submitted
meteoric
stones
to
spectrum
analysis
with
the
result
that
i
have
found
carbon
that
is
to
say
a
clear
trace
of
organic
life
what
do
you
say
to
that
doctor
can
you
see
that
with
it
microscope
captain
lord
no
with
the
spectroscope
doctor
the
spectroscope
pardon
then
you
will
soon
be
able
to
tell
us
what
is
happening
on
jupiter
captain
not
what
is
happening
but
what
has
happened
if
only
the
confounded
booksellers
in
paris
would
send
me
the
books
but
i
believe
all
the
booksellers
in
the
universe
have
conspired
against
me
think
of
it
for
the
last
two
months
not
a
single
one
has
ever
answered
my
communications
neither
letters
nor
abusive
telegrams
i
shall
go
mad
over
it
and
i
ca
imagine
what
the
matter
doctor
oh
i
suppose
it
the
usual
carelessness
you
must
let
it
vex
you
so
captain
but
the
devil
of
it
is
i
shall
not
get
my
treatise
done
in
time
and
i
know
they
are
working
along
the
same
lines
in
berlin
but
we
should
be
talking
about
this
but
about
you
if
you
care
to
live
here
we
have
rooms
for
you
in
the
wing
or
perhaps
you
would
rather
live
in
the
old
quarters
doctor
just
as
you
like
captain
no
as
you
like
which
is
it
to
be
doctor
you
must
decide
that
captain
captain
no
it
not
for
me
to
decide
you
must
say
which
you
prefer
i
have
no
preference
in
the
matter
none
at
all
doctor
oh
but
i
really
can
not
decide
captain
for
heaven
sake
doctor
say
which
you
prefer
i
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
no
opinion
no
wishes
have
you
got
character
enough
to
know
what
you
want
answer
me
or
i
shall
be
provoked
doctor
well
if
it
rests
with
me
i
prefer
to
live
here
captain
thank
you
forgive
me
doctor
but
nothing
annoys
me
so
touch
as
to
see
people
undecided
about
anything
nurse
comes
in
oh
there
you
are
margret
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
the
rooms
in
the
wing
are
in
order
for
the
doctor
nurse
yes
sir
they
are
captain
very
well
then
i
wo
detain
you
doctor
you
must
be
tired
good
bye
and
welcome
once
more
i
shall
see
you
tomorrow
i
hope
doctor
good
evening
captain
captain
i
daresay
that
my
wife
explained
conditions
here
to
you
a
little
so
that
you
have
some
idea
how
the
land
lies
doctor
yes
your
excellent
wife
has
given
me
a
few
hints
about
this
and
that
such
as
were
necessary
to
a
stranger
good
evening
captain
captain
to
nurse
what
do
you
want
you
old
dear
what
is
it
nurse
now
little
master
adolf
just
listen
captain
yes
margret
you
are
the
only
one
i
can
listen
to
without
having
spasms
nurse
now
listen
adolf
do
you
think
you
should
go
and
come
to
an
agreement
with
mistress
in
this
fuss
over
the
child
just
think
of
a
mother
captain
think
of
a
father
margret
nurse
there
there
there
a
father
has
something
besides
his
child
but
a
mother
has
nothing
but
her
child
captain
just
so
you
old
dear
she
has
only
one
burden
but
i
have
three
and
i
have
her
burden
too
do
you
think
that
i
should
hold
a
better
position
in
the
world
than
that
of
a
poor
soldier
if
i
had
not
had
her
and
her
child
nurse
well
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
talk
about
captain
i
can
well
believe
that
for
you
wanted
to
make
it
appear
that
i
am
in
the
wrong
nurse
do
you
believe
adolf
that
i
wish
you
well
captain
yes
dear
friend
i
do
believe
it
but
you
do
know
what
is
for
my
good
you
see
it
is
enough
for
me
to
have
given
the
child
life
i
want
to
give
her
my
soul
too
nurse
such
things
i
do
understand
but
i
do
think
that
you
ought
to
be
able
to
agree
captain
you
are
not
my
friend
margret
nurse
i
oh
lord
what
are
you
saying
adolf
do
you
think
i
can
forget
that
you
were
my
child
when
you
were
little
captain
well
you
dear
have
i
forgotten
it
you
have
been
like
a
mother
to
me
and
always
have
stood
by
me
when
i
had
everybody
against
me
but
now
when
i
really
need
you
you
desert
me
and
go
over
to
the
enemy
nurse
the
enemy
captain
yes
the
enemy
you
know
well
enough
how
things
are
in
this
house
you
have
seen
everything
from
the
beginning
nurse
indeed
i
have
seen
but
god
knows
why
two
people
should
torment
the
life
out
of
each
other
two
people
who
are
otherwise
so
good
and
wish
all
others
well
mistress
is
never
like
that
to
me
or
to
others
captain
only
to
me
i
know
it
but
let
me
tell
you
margret
if
you
desert
me
now
you
will
do
wrong
for
now
they
have
begun
to
weave
a
plot
against
me
and
that
doctor
is
not
my
friend
nurse
oh
adolf
you
believe
evil
about
everybody
but
you
see
because
you
have
the
true
faith
that
just
what
it
is
captain
yes
you
and
the
baptists
have
found
the
only
true
faith
you
are
indeed
lucky
nurse
anyway
i
not
unhappy
like
you
adolf
humble
your
heart
and
you
will
see
that
god
will
make
you
happy
in
your
love
for
your
neighbor
captain
it
a
strange
thing
that
you
no
sooner
speak
of
god
and
love
than
your
voice
becomes
hard
and
your
eyes
fill
with
hate
no
margret
surely
you
have
not
the
true
faith
nurse
yes
go
on
being
proud
and
hard
in
your
learning
but
it
amount
to
much
when
it
comes
to
the
test
captain
how
mightily
you
talk
humble
heart
i
know
very
well
that
knowledge
is
of
no
use
to
you
women
nurse
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
but
in
spite
of
everything
old
margret
cares
most
for
her
great
big
boy
and
he
will
come
back
to
the
fold
when
it
stormy
weather
captain
margret
forgive
me
but
believe
me
when
i
say
that
there
is
no
one
here
who
wishes
me
well
but
you
help
me
for
i
feel
that
something
is
going
to
happen
here
what
it
is
i
do
know
but
something
evil
is
on
the
way
scream
from
within
what
that
who
that
screaming
berths
enters
from
inner
room
bertha
father
father
help
me
save
me
captain
my
dear
child
what
is
it
speak
bertha

me
she
wants
to
hurt
me
captain
who
wants
to
hurt
you
tell
me
speak
bertha
grandmother
but
it
my
fault
for
i
deceived
her
captain
tell
me
more
bertha
yes
but
you
must
say
anything
about
it
promise
me
you
wo
captain
tell
me
what
it
is
then
nurse
goes
bertha
in
the
evening
she
generally
turns
down
the
lamp
and
then
she
makes
me
sit
at
a
table
holding
a
pen
over
a
piece
of
paper
and
then
she
says
that
the
spirits
are
to
write
captain
what
all
this
and
you
have
never
told
me
about
it
bertha
forgive
me
but
i
dared
not
for
grandmother
says
the
spirits
take
revenge
if
one
talks
about
them
and
then
the
pen
writes
but
i
do
know
whether
i
doing
it
or
not
sometimes
it
goes
well
but
sometimes
it
wo
go
at
all
and
when
i
am
tired
nothing
comes
but
she
wants
it
to
come
just
the
same
and
tonight
i
thought
i
was
writing
beautifully
but
then
grandmother
said
it
was
all
from
stagnelius
and
that
i
had
deceived
her
and
then
she
got
terribly
angry
captain
do
you
believe
that
there
are
spirits
bertha
i
do
know
captain
but
i
know
that
there
are
none
bertha
but
grandmother
says
that
you
do
understand
father
and
that
you
do
much
worse
things
you
who
can
see
to
other
planets
captain
does
she
say
that
does
she
say
that
what
else
does
she
say
bertha
she
says
that
you
ca
work
witchery
captain
i
never
said
that
i
could
you
know
what
meteoric
stones
are
stones
that
fall
from
other
heavenly
bodies
i
can
examine
them
and
learn
whether
they
contain
the
same
elements
as
our
world
that
is
all
i
can
tell
bertha
but
grandmother
says
that
there
are
things
that
she
can
see
which
you
can
not
see
captain
then
she
lies
bertha
grandmother
does
tell
lies
captain
why
does
she
bertha
then
mother
tells
lies
too
captain
h
bertha
and
if
you
say
that
mother
lies
i
can
never
believe
in
you
again
captain
i
have
not
said
so
and
so
you
must
believe
in
me
when
i
tell
you
that
it
is
for
your
future
good
that
you
should
leave
home
will
you
will
you
go
to
town
and
learn
something
useful
bertha
oh
yes
i
should
love
to
go
to
town
away
from
here
anywhere
if
i
can
only
see
you
sometimes
often
oh
it
is
so
gloomy
and
awful
in
there
all
the
time
like
a
winter
night
but
when
you
come
home
father
it
is
like
a
morning
in
spring
when
they
take
off
the
double
windows
captain
my
beloved
child
my
dear
child
bertha
but
father
you
be
good
to
mother
wo
you
she
cries
so
often
captain
h
then
you
want
to
go
to
town
bertha
yes
yes
captain
but
if
mother
does
want
you
to
go
bertha
but
she
must
let
me
captain
but
if
she
wo
bertha
well
then
i
do
know
what
will
happen
but
she
must
she
must
captain
will
you
ask
her
bertha
you
must
ask
her
very
nicely
she
would
pay
any
attention
to
my
asking
captain
h
now
if
you
wish
it
and
i
wish
it
and
she
does
wish
it
what
shall
we
do
then
bertha
oh
then
it
will
all
be
in
a
tangle
again
why
ca
you
both
laura
comes
in
laura
oh
so
bertha
is
here
then
perhaps
we
may
have
her
own
opinion
as
the
question
of
her
future
has
to
be
decided
captain
the
child
can
hardly
have
any
opinion
about
what
a
young
girl
life
is
likely
to
be
while
we
on
the
contrary
can
more
easily
estimate
what
it
may
be
as
we
have
seen
so
many
young
girls
grow
up
laura
but
as
we
are
of
different
opinions
bertha
must
be
the
one
to
decide
captain
no
i
let
no
one
usurp
my
rights
neither
women
nor
children
bertha
leave
us
bertha
goes
out
laura
you
were
afraid
of
hearing
her
opinion
because
you
thought
it
would
be
to
my
advantage
captain
i
know
that
she
wishes
to
go
away
from
home
but
i
know
also
that
you
possess
the
power
of
changing
her
mind
to
suit
your
pleasure
laura
oh
am
i
really
so
powerful
captain
yes
you
have
a
fiendish
power
of
getting
your
own
way
but
so
has
anyone
who
does
not
scruple
about
the
way
it
is
accomplished
how
did
you
get
doctor
norling
away
for
instance
and
how
did
you
get
this
new
doctor
here
laura
yes
how
did
i
manage
that
captain
you
insulted
the
other
one
so
much
that
he
left
and
made
your
brother
recommend
this
fellow
laura
well
that
was
quite
simple
and
legitimate
is
bertha
to
leave
home
now
captain
yes
she
is
to
start
in
a
fortnight
laura
that
is
your
decision
captain
yes
laura
then
i
must
try
to
prevent
it
captain
you
can
not
laura
ca
i
do
you
really
think
i
would
trust
my
daughter
to
wicked
people
to
have
her
taught
that
everything
her
mother
has
implanted
in
her
child
is
mere
foolishness
why
afterward
she
would
despise
me
all
the
rest
of
her
life
captain
do
you
think
that
a
father
should
allow
ignorant
and
conceited
women
to
teach
his
daughter
that
he
is
a
charlatan
laura
it
means
less
to
the
father
captain
why
so
laura
because
the
mother
is
closer
to
the
child
as
it
has
been
discovered
that
no
one
can
tell
for
a
certainty
who
the
father
of
a
child
is
captain
how
does
that
apply
to
this
case
laura
you
do
not
know
whether
you
are
bertha
father
or
not
captain
i
do
not
know
laura
no
what
no
one
knows
you
surely
can
not
know
captain
are
you
joking
laura
no
i
am
only
making
use
of
your
own
teaching
for
that
matter
how
do
you
know
that
i
have
not
been
unfaithful
to
you
captain
i
believe
you
capable
of
almost
anything
but
not
that
nor
that
you
would
talk
about
it
if
it
were
true
laura
suppose
that
i
was
prepared
to
bear
anything
even
to
being
despised
and
driven
out
everything
for
the
sake
of
being
able
to
keep
and
control
my
child
and
that
i
am
truthful
now
when
i
declare
that
bertha
is
my
child
but
not
yours
suppose
captain
stop
now
laura
just
suppose
this
in
that
case
your
power
would
be
at
an
end
captain
when
you
had
proved
that
i
was
not
the
father
laura
that
would
not
be
difficult
would
you
like
me
to
do
so
captain
stop
laura
of
course
i
should
only
need
to
declare
the
name
of
the
real
father
give
all
details
of
place
and
time
for
instance
when
was
bertha
born
in
the
third
year
of
our
marriage
captain
stop
now
or
else
laura
or
else
what
shall
we
stop
now
think
carefully
about
all
you
do
and
decide
and
whatever
you
do
do
make
yourself
ridiculous
captain
i
consider
all
this
most
lamentable
laura
which
makes
you
all
the
more
ridiculous
captain
and
you
laura
oh
we
women
are
really
too
clever
captain
that
why
one
can
not
contend
with
you
laura
then
why
provoke
contests
with
a
superior
enemy
captain
superior
laura
yes
it
queer
but
i
have
never
looked
at
a
man
without
knowing
myself
to
be
his
superior
captain
then
you
shall
be
made
to
see
your
superior
for
once
so
that
you
shall
never
forget
it
laura
that
will
be
interesting
nurse
comes
in
supper
is
served
will
you
come
in
laura
very
well
captain
lingers
sits
down
with
a
magazine
in
an
arm
chair
near

good
now

stay
there
then
goes
nurse
adolf
what
is
this
all
about
captain
i
do
know
what
it
is
can
you
explain
to
me
why
you
women
treat
an
old
man
as
if
he
were
a
child
nurse
i
do
understand
it
but
it
must
be
because
all
you
men
great
and
small
are
women
children
every
man
of
you
captain
but
no
women
are
born
of
men

captain

into
the
covered

nurse

at
once
orderly
goes
nurse
good

what
going
to
happen
now
captain
puts
on
his
cap
and
coat
and
prepares
to
go
out
captain
do
expect
me
home
before
midnight
goes
nurse
lord
preserve
us
whatever
will
be
the
end
of
this
act
ii
the
same
scene
as
in
previous
act
a
lighted
lamp
is
on
the
table
it
is
night
the
doctor
and
laura
are
discovered
at
rise
of
curtain
doctor
from
what
i
gathered
during
my
conversation
with
him
the
case
is
not
fully
proved
to
me
in
the
first
place
you
made
a
mistake
in
saying
that
he
had
arrived
at
these
astonishing
results
about
other
heavenly
bodies
by
means
of
a
microscope
now
that
i
have
learned
that
it
was
a
spectroscope
he
is
not
only
cleared
of
any
suspicion
of
insanity
but
has
rendered
a
great
service
to
science
laura
yes
but
i
never
said
that
doctor
madam
i
made
careful
notes
of
our
conversation
and
i
remember
that
i
asked
about
this
very
point
because
i
thought
i
had
misunderstood
you
one
must
be
very
careful
in
making
such
accusations
when
a
certificate
in
lunacy
is
in
question
laura
a
certificate
in
lunacy
doctor
yes
you
must
surely
know
that
an
insane
person
loses
both
civil
and
family
rights
laura
no
i
did
not
know
that
doctor
there
was
another
matter
that
seemed
to
me
suspicious
he
spoke
of
his
communications
to
his
booksellers
not
being
answered
permit
me
to
ask
if
you
through
motives
of
mistaken
kindness
have
intercepted
them
laura
yes
i
have
it
was
my
duty
to
guard
the
interests
of
the
family
and
i
could
not
let
him
ruin
us
all
without
some
intervention
doctor
pardon
me
but
i
think
you
can
not
have
considered
the
consequences
of
such
an
act
if
he
discovers
your
secret
interference
in
his
affairs
he
will
have
grounds
for
suspicions
and
they
will
grow
like
an
avalanche
and
besides
in
doing
this
you
have
thwarted
his
will
and
irritated
him
still
more
you
must
have
felt
yourself
how
the
mind
rebels
when
one
deepest
desires
are
thwarted
and
one
will
is
crossed
laura
have
i
felt
that
doctor
think
then
what
he
must
have
gone
through
laura
rising
it
is
midnight
and
he
has
come
home
now
we
may
fear
the
worst
doctor
but
tell
me
what
actually
happened
this
evening
after
i
left
i
must
know
everything
laura
he
raved
in
the
wildest
way
and
had
the
strangest
ideas
for
instance
that
he
is
not
the
father
of
his
child
doctor
that
is
strange
how
did
such
an
idea
come
into
his
head
laura
i
really
ca
imagine
unless
it
was
because
he
had
to
question
one
of
the
men
about
supporting
a
child
and
when
i
tried
to
defend
the
girl
he
grew
excited
and
said
no
one
could
tell
who
was
the
father
of
a
child
god
knows
i
did
everything
to
calm
him
but
now
i
believe
there
is
no
help
for
him
cries
doctor
but
this
can
not
go
on
something
must
be
done
here
without
of
course
arousing
his
suspicions
tell
me
has
the
captain
ever
had
such
delusions
before
laura
six
years
ago
things
were
in
the
same
state
and
then
he
himself
confessed
in
his
own
letter
to
the
doctor
that
he
feared
for
his
reason
doctor
yes
yes
yes
this
is
a
story
that
has
deep
roots
and
the
sanctity
of
the
family
life
and
so
on
of
course
i
can
not
ask
about
everything
but
must
limit
myself
to
appearances
what
is
done
be
undone
more
the
pity
yet
the
remedy
should
be
based
upon
all
the
where
do
you
think
he
is
now
laura
i
have
no
idea
he
has
such
wild
streaks
doctor
would
you
like
to
have
me
stay
until
he
returns
to
avoid
suspicion
i
could
say
that
i
had
come
to
see
your
mother
who
is
not
well
laura
yes
that
will
do
very
nicely
do
leave
us
doctor
if
you
only
knew
how
troubled
i
am
but
would
it
be
better
to
tell
him
outright
what
you
think
of
his
condition
doctor
we
never
do
that
unless
the
patient
mentions
the
subject
himself
and
very
seldom
even
then
it
depends
entirely
on
the
case
but
we
must
sit
here
perhaps
i
had
better
go
into
the
next
room
it
will
look
more
natural
laura
yes
that
will
be
better
and
margret
can
sit
here
she
always
waits
up
when
he
is
out
and
she
is
the
only
one
who
has
any
power
over
him
goes
to
the
door
left
margret
margret
nurse
yes
has
the
master
come
home
laura
no
but
you
are
to
sit
here
and
wait
for
him
and
when
he
does
come
you
are
to
say
my
mother
is
ill
and
that
why
the
doctor
is
here
nurse
yes
yes
i
see
that
everything
is
all
right
laura
opens
the
door
to
inner
rooms
will
you
come
in
here
doctor
doctor
thank
you
nurse
seats
herself
at
the
table
and
takes
up
a
hymn
book
and
spectacles
and
reads
nurse
ah
yes
ah
yes
reads
half
aloud
ah
woe
is
me
how
sad
a
thing
is
life
within
this
vale
of
tears
death
angel
triumphs
like
a
king
and
calls
aloud
to
all
the
spheres
vanity
all
is
vanity
yes
yes
yes
yes
reads
again
all
that
on
earth
hath
life
and
breath
to
earth
must
fall
before
his
spear
and
sorrow
saved
alone
from
death
inscribes
above
the
mighty
bier
vanity
all
is
vanity
yes
yes
bertha
comes
in
with
a
and
some
embroidery
she
speaks
in
a
low
voice
margret
may
i
sit
with
you
it
is
so
frightfully
lonely
up
there
nurse
for
goodness
sake
are
you
still
up
bertha
bertha
you
see
i
want
to
finish
father
christmas
present
and
something
that
you
like
nurse
but
bless
my
soul
this
wo
do
you
must
be
up
in
the
morning
and
it
after
midnight
now
bertha
what
does
it
matter
i
do
dare
sit
up
there
alone
i
believe
the
spirits
are
at
work
nurse
you
see
just
what
i
said
mark
my
words
this
house
was
not
built
on
a
lucky
spot
what
did
you
hear
bertha
think
of
it
i
heard
some
one
singing
up
in
the
attic
nurse
in
the
attic
at
this
hour
bertha
yes
it
was
such
it
sorrowful
melancholy
song
i
never
heard
anything
like
it
it
sounded
as
if
it
came
from
the
where
the
cradle
stands
you
know
to
the
left
nurse
dear
me
dear
me
and
such
a
fearful
night
it
seems
as
if
the
chimneys
would
blow
down
ah
what
is
then
this
earthly
life
but
grief
afliction
and
great
strife
when
fairest
it
has
seemed
nought
but
pain
it
can
be
deemed
ah
dear
child
may
god
give
us
a
good
christmas
bertha
margret
is
it
true
that
father
is
ill
nurse
yes
i
afraid
he
is
bertha
then
we
ca
keep
christmas
eve
but
how
can
he
be
up
and
around
if
he
is
nurse
you
see
my
child
the
kind
of
illness
he
has
does
keep
him
from
being
up
hush
there
some
one
out
in
the
hall
go
to
bed
now
and
take
the
coffee
pot
away
or
the
master
will
be
angry
bertha
going
out
with
tray
good
night
margret
nurse
good
night
my
child
god
bless
you
captain
comes
in
takes
off
his
overcoat
captain
are
you
still
up
go
to
bed
nurse
i
was
only
waiting
till
captain
lights
a
candle
opens
his
desk
sits
down
at
it
and
takes
letters
and
newspapers
out
of
his
pocket
nurse
adolf
captain
what
do
you
want
nurse
old
mistress
is
ill
and
the
doctor
is
here
captain
is
it
anything
dangerous
nurse
no
i
do
think
so
just
a
cold
captain
gets
up
margret
who
was
the
father
of
your
child
nurse
oh
i
told
you
many
and
many
a
time
it
was
that
scamp
johansson
captain
are
you
sure
that
it
was
he
nurse
how
childish
you
are
of
course
i
sure
when
he
was
the
only
one
captain
yes
but
was
he
sure
that
he
was
the
only
one
no
he
could
not
be
but
you
could
be
sure
of
it
there
is
a
difference
you
see
nurse
well
i
ca
see
any
difference
captain
no
you
can
not
see
it
but
the
difference
exists
nevertheless
turns
over
the
pages
of
a
photograph
album
which
is
on
the
table
do
you
think
bertha
looks
like
me
nurse
of
course
why
you
are
as
like
as
two
peas
captain
did
johansson
confess
that
he
was
the
father
nurse
he
was
forced
to
captain
how
terrible
here
is
the
doctor
doctor
comes
in
good
evening
doctor
how
is
my
doctor
oh
it
nothing
serious
merely
a
slight
sprain
of
the
left
ankle
captain
i
thought
margret
said
it
was
a
cold
there
seem
to
be
different
opinions
about
the
same
case
go
to
bed
margret
nurse
goes
a
pause
captain
sit
down
doctor
doctor
sits
thanks
captain
is
it
true
that
you
obtain
striped
foals
if
you
cross
a
zebra
and
a
mare
doctor
astonished
perfectly
true
captain
is
it
true
that
the
foals
continue
to
be
striped
if
the
breed
is
continued
with
a
stallion
doctor
yes
that
is
true
too
captain
that
is
to
say
under
certain
conditions
a
stallion
can
be
sire
to
striped
foals
or
the
opposite
doctor
yes
so
it
seems
captain
therefore
an
offspring
likeness
to
the
father
proves
nothing
doctor
well
captain
that
is
to
say
paternity
can
not
be
proven
doctor
h
well
captain
you
are
a
widower
are
you
and
have
had
children
doctor
captain
did
you
ever
feel
ridiculous
as
father
i
know
of
nothing
so
ludicrous
as
to
see
a
father
leading
his
children
by
the
hand
around
the
streets
or
to
hear
it
father
talk
about
his
children
my
children
he
ought
to
say
did
you
ever
feel
how
false
your
position
was
were
you
ever
afflicted
with
doubts
i
wo
say
suspicions
for
as
a
gentleman
i
assume
that
your
wife
was
above
suspicion
doctor
no
really
i
never
was
but
captain
i
believe
goethe
says
a
man
must
take
his
children
on
good
faith
captain
it
risky
to
take
anything
on
good
faith
where
a
woman
is
concerned
doctor
oh
there
are
so
many
kinds
of
women
captain
modern
investigations
have
pronounced
that
there
is
only
one
kind
lately
i
have
recalled
two
instances
in
my
life
that
make
me
believe
this
when
i
was
young
i
was
strong
and
if
i
may
boast
handsome
once
when
i
was
making
a
trip
on
a
steamer
and
sitting
with
a
few
friends
in
the
saloon
the
young
stewardess
came
and
flung
herself
down
by
me
burst
into
tears
and
told
us
that
her
sweetheart
was
drowned
we
sympathized
with
her
and
i
ordered
some
champagne
after
the
second
glass
i
touched
her
foot
after
the
fourth
her
knee
and
before
morning
i
had
consoled
her
doctor
that
was
just
a
winter
fly
captain
now
comes
the
second
instance
and
that
was
a
real
summer
fly
i
was
at
lyskil
there
was
a
young
married
woman
stopping
there
with
her
children
but
her
husband
was
in
town
she
was
religious
had
extremely
strict
principles
preached
morals
to
me
and
was
i
believe
entirely
honorable
i
lent
her
a
book
two
books
and
when
she
was
leaving
she
returned
them
strange
to
say
three
months
later
in
those
very
books
i
found
her
card
with
a
declaration
on
it
it
was
innocent
as
innocent
its
it
declaration
of
love
can
be
from
a
married
woman
to
a
strange
man
who
never
made
any
advances
now
comes
the
moral
just
do
have
too
much
faith
doctor
do
have
too
little
faith
either
captain
no
but
just
enough
but
you
see
doctor
that
woman
was
so
unconsciously
dishonest
that
she
talked
to
her
husband
about
the
fancy
she
had
taken
to
me
that
what
makes
it
dangerous
this
very
unconsciousness
of
their
instinctive
dishonesty
that
is
a
mitigating
circumstance
i
admit
but
it
can
not
nullify
judgment
only
soften
it
doctor
captain
your
thoughts
are
taking
a
morbid
turn
and
you
ought
to
control
them
captain
you
must
not
use
the
word
morbid
steam
boilers
as
you
know
explode
at
it
certain
pressure
but
the
same
pressure
is
not
needed
for
all
boiler
explosions
you
understand
however
you
are
here
to
watch
me
if
i
were
not
a
man
i
should
have
the
right
to
make
accusations
or
complaints
as
they
are
so
cleverly
called
and
perhaps
i
should
be
able
to
give
you
the
whole
diagnosis
and
what
is
more
the
history
of
my
disease
but
unfortunately
i
am
a
man
and
there
is
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
like
a
roman
fold
my
arms
across
my
breast
and
hold
my
breath
till
i
die
doctor
captain
if
you
are
ill
it
will
not
reflect
upon
your
honor
as
a
man
to
tell
me
all
in
fact
i
ought
to
hear
the
other
side
captain
you
have
had
enough
in
hearing
the
one
i
imagine
do
you
know
when
i
heard
alving
eulogizing
her
dead
husband
i
thought
to
myself
what
a
damned
pity
it
was
the
fellow
was
dead
do
you
suppose
that
he
would
have
spoken
if
he
had
been
alive
and
do
you
suppose
that
if
any
of
the
dead
husbands
came
back
they
would
be
believed
good
night
doctor
you
see
that
i
am
calm
and
you
can
retire
without
fear
doctor
good
night
then
captain
i
afraid
i
can
be
of
no
further
use
in
this
case
captain
are
we
enemies
doctor
far
from
it
but
it
is
too
bad
we
can
not
be
friends
good
night
goes
the
captain
follows
the
doctor
to
the
door
at
back
and
then
goes
to
the
door
at
left
and
opens
it
slightly
captain
come
in
and
we
talk
i
heard
you
out
there
listening
laura
embarrassed
captain
sits
at
desk
it
is
late
but
we
must
come
to
some
decision
sit
down
pause
i
have
been
at
the
post
office
tonight
to
get
my
letters
from
these
it
appears
that
you
have
been
keeping
back
my
mail
both
coming
and
going
the
consequence
of
which
is
that
the
loss
of
time
has
its
good
as
destroyed
the
result
i
expected
from
my
work
laura
it
was
an
act
of
kindness
on
my
part
as
you
neglected
the
service
for
this
other
work
captain
it
was
hardly
kindness
for
you
were
quite
sure
that
some
day
i
should
win
more
honor
from
that
than
from
the
service
but
you
were
particularly
anxious
that
i
should
not
win
such
honors
for
fear
your
own
insignificance
would
be
emphasized
by
it
in
consequence
of
all
this
i
have
intercepted
letters
addressed
to
you
laura
that
was
a
noble
act
captain
you
see
you
have
as
you
might
say
a
high
opinion
of
me
it
appears
from
these
letters
that
for
some
time
past
you
have
been
arraying
my
old
friends
against
me
by
spreading
reports
about
my
mental
condition
and
you
dave
succeeded
in
your
efforts
for
now
not
more
than
one
person
exists
from
the
colonel
down
to
the
cook
who
believes
that
i
am
sane
now
these
are
the
facts
about
my
illness
my
mind
is
sound
as
you
know
so
that
i
can
take
care
of
my
duties
in
the
service
as
well
its
my
responsibilities
as
a
father
my
feelings
are
more
or
less
under
my
control
as
my
will
has
not
been
completely
undermined
but
you
have
gnawed
and
nibbled
at
it
so
that
it
will
soon
slip
the
cogs
and
then
the
whole
mechanism
will
slip
and
go
to
smash
i
will
not
appeal
to
your
feelings
for
you
have
none
that
is
your
strength
but
i
will
appeal
to
your
interests
laura
let
me
hear
captain
you
have
succeeded
in
arousing
my
suspicions
to
such
an
extent
that
my
judgment
is
no
longer
clear
and
my
thoughts
begin
to
wander
this
is
the
approaching
insanity
that
you
are
waiting
for
which
may
come
at
any
time
now
so
you
are
face
to
face
with
the
question
whether
it
is
more
to
your
interest
that
i
should
be
sane
or
insane
consider
if
i
go
under
i
shall
lose
the
service
and
where
will
you
be
then
if
i
die
my
life
insurance
will
fall
to
you
but
if
i
take
my
own
life
you
will
get
nothing
consequently
it
is
to
your
interest
that
i
should
live
out
my
life
laura
is
this
a
trap
captain
to
be
sure
but
it
rests
with
you
whether
you
will
run
around
it
or
stick
your
head
into
it
laura
you
say
that
you
will
kill
yourself
you
wo
do
that
captain
are
you
sure
do
you
think
a
man
can
live
when
he
has
nothing
and
no
one
to
live
for
laura
you
surrender
then
captain
no
i
offer
peace
laura
the
conditions
captain
that
i
may
keep
my
reason
free
me
from
my
suspicions
and
i
give
up
the
conflict
laura
what
suspicions
captain
about
bertha
origin
laura
are
there
any
doubts
about
that
captain
yes
i
have
doubts
and
you
have
awakened
them
laura
i
captain
yes
you
have
dropped
them
like
henbane
in
my
ears
and
circumstances
have
strengthened
them
free
me
from
the
uncertainty
tell
me
outright
that
it
is
true
and
i
will
forgive
you
beforehand
laura
how
can
i
acknowledge
a
sin
that
i
have
not
committed
captain
what
does
it
matter
when
you
know
that
i
shall
not
divulge
it
do
you
think
a
man
would
go
and
spread
his
own
shame
broadcast
laura
if
i
say
it
is
true
you
wo
be
convinced
but
if
i
say
it
is
then
you
will
be
convinced
you
seem
to
hope
it
is
true
captain
yes
strangely
enough
it
must
be
because
the
first
supposition
ca
be
proved
the
latter
can
be
laura
have
you
tiny
ground
for
your
suspicions
captain
yes
and
no
laura
i
believe
you
want
to
prove
me
guilty
so
that
you
can
get
rid
of
me
and
then
have
absolute
control
over
the
child
but
you
wo
catch
me
in
any
such
snare
captain
do
you
think
that
i
would
want
to
be
responsible
for
another
man
child
if
i
were
convinced
of
your
guilt
laura
no
i
sure
you
would
and
that
what
makes
me
know
you
lied
just
now
when
you
said
that
you
would
forgive
me
beforehand
captain
rises
laura
save
me
and
my
reason
you
do
seem
to
understand
what
i
say
if
the
child
is
not
mine
i
have
no
control
over
her
and
do
want
to
have
any
and
that
is
precisely
what
you
do
want
is
it
but
perhaps
you
want
even
more
to
have
power
over
the
child
but
still
have
me
to
support
you
laura
power
yes
what
has
this
whole
life
and
death
struggle
been
for
but
power
captain
to
me
it
has
meant
more
i
do
not
believe
in
a
hereafter
the
child
was
my
future
life
that
was
my
conception
of
immortality
and
perhaps
the
only
one
that
has
any
analogy
in
reality
if
you
take
that
away
from
me
you
cut
off
my
life
laura
why
did
we
separate
in
time
captain
because
the
child
bound
us
together
but
the
link
became
a
chain
and
how
did
it
happen
how
i
have
never
thought
about
this
but
now
memories
rise
up
accusingly
condemningly
perhaps
we
had
been
married
two
years
and
had
no
children
you
know
why
i
fell
ill
and
lay
at
the
point
of
death
during
a
conscious
interval
of
the
fever
i
heard
voices
out
in
the
it
was
you
and
the
lawyer
talking
about
the
fortune
that
i
still
possessed
he
explained
that
you
could
inherit
nothing
because
we
had
no
children
and
he
asked
you
if
you
were
expecting
to
become
a
mother
i
did
not
hear
your
reply
i
recovered
and
we
had
a
child
who
is
its
father
laura
you
captain
no
i
am
not
here
is
a
buried
crime
that
begins
to
stench
and
what
a
hellish
crime
you
women
have
been
compassionate
enough
to
free
the
black
slaves
but
you
have
kept
the
white
ones
i
have
worked
and
slaved
for
you
your
child
your
mother
your
servants
i
have
sacrificed
promotion
and
career
i
have
endured
torture
flagellation
sleeplessness
worry
for
your
sake
until
my
hair
has
grown
gray
and
all
that
you
might
enjoy
a
life
without
care
and
when
you
grew
old
enjoy
life
over
again
in
your
child
i
have
borne
everything
without
complaint
because
i
thought
myself
the
father
of
your
child
this
is
the
commonest
kind
of
theft
the
most
brutal
slavery
i
have
had
seventeen
years
of
penal
servitude
and
have
been
innocent
what
can
you
give
me
in
return
for
that
laura
now
you
are
quite
mad
captain
that
is
your
hope
and
i
see
how
you
have
labored
to
conceal
your
crime
i
sympathized
with
you
because
i
did
not
understand
your
grief
i
have
often
lulled
your
evil
conscience
to
rest
when
i
thought
i
was
driving
away
morbid
thoughts
i
have
heard
you
cry
out
in
your
sleep
and
not
wanted
to
listen
i
remember
now
night
before
last
birthday
it
was
between
two
and
three
in
the
morning
and
i
was
sitting
up
reading
you
shrieked
do
do
as
if
someone
were
strangling
you
i
knocked
on
the
wall
i
did
want
to
hear
any
more
i
have
had
my
suspicions
for
a
long
time
but
i
did
not
dare
to
hear
them
confirmed
all
this
i
have
suffered
for
you
what
will
you
do
for
me
laura
what
can
i
do
i
will
swear
by
god
and
all
i
hold
sacred
that
you
are
bertha
father
captain
what
use
is
that
when
you
have
often
said
that
a
mother
can
and
ought
to
commit
any
crime
for
her
child
i
implore
you
as
a
wounded
man
begs
for
a
death
blow
to
tell
me
all
do
you
see
i
as
helpless
as
a
child
do
you
hear
me
complaining
as
to
a
mother
wo
you
forget
that
i
am
a
man
that
i
am
a
soldier
who
can
tame
men
and
beasts
with
a
word
like
a
sick
man
i
only
ask
for
compassion
i
lay
down
the
tokens
of
my
power
and
implore
you
to
have
mercy
on
my
life
laura
approaches
him
and
lays
her
hand
on
his
brow
laura
what
you
are
crying
man
captain
yes
i
am
crying
although
i
am
a
man
but
has
not
a
man
eyes
has
not
a
man
hands
limbs
senses
thoughts
passions
is
he
not
fed
with
the
wine
food
hurt
by
the
same
weapons
warmed
and
cooled
by
the
same
summer
and
winter
as
a
woman
if
you
prick
us
do
we
not
bleed
if
you
tickle
us
do
we
not
laugh
and
if
you
poison
us
do
we
not
die
why
should
a
man
complain
a
soldier
weep
because
it
is
unmanly
why
is
it
unmanly
laura
weep
then
my
child
as
if
you
were
with
your
mother
once
more
do
you
remember
when
i
first
came
into
your
life
i
was
like
a
second
mother
your
great
strong
body
needed
nerves
you
were
a
giant
child
that
had
either
come
too
early
into
the
world
or
perhaps
was
not
wanted
at
all
captain
yes
that
how
it
was
my
father
and
my
mother
will
was
against
my
coming
into
the
world
and
consequently
i
was
born
without
a
will
i
thought
i
was
completing
myself
when
you
and
i
became
one
and
therefore
you
were
allowed
to
rule
and
i
the
commander
at
the
barracks
and
before
the
troops
became
obedient
to
you
grew
through
you
looked
up
to
you
as
to
it
more
being
listened
to
you
as
if
i
had
been
your
undeveloped
child
laura
yes
that
the
way
it
was
and
therefore
i
loved
you
as
my
child
but
you
know
you
must
have
seen
when
the
nature
of
your
feelings
changed
and
you
appeared
as
my
lover
that
i
blushed
and
your
embraces
were
joy
that
was
followed
by
a
remorseful
conscience
as
if
my
blood
were
ashamed
the
mother
became
the
mistress
ugh
captain
i
saw
it
but
i
did
not
understand
i
believed
you
despised
me
for
my
unmanliness
and
i
wanted
to
win
you
as
a
woman
by
being
a
man
laura
yes
but
there
was
the
mistake
the
mother
was
your
friend
you
see
but
the
woman
was
your
enemy
and
love
between
the
sexes
is
strife
do
not
think
that
i
gave
myself
i
did
not
give
but
i
took
what
i
wanted
but
you
had
one
advantage
i
felt
that
and
i
wanted
you
to
feel
it
captain
you
always
had
the
advantage
you
could
hypnotize
me
when
i
was
wide
awake
so
that
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
but
merely
obeyed
you
could
give
me
a
raw
potato
and
make
me
imagine
it
was
a
peach
you
could
force
me
to
admire
your
foolish
caprices
as
though
they
were
strokes
of
genius
you
could
have
influenced
me
to
crime
yes
even
to
mean
paltry
deeds
because
you
lacked
intelligence
instead
of
carrying
out
my
ideas
you
acted
on
your
own
judgment
but
when
at
last
i
awoke
i
realized
that
my
honor
had
been
corrupted
and
i
wanted
to
blot
out
the
memory
by
a
great
deed
an
achievement
a
discovery
or
an
honorable
suicide
i
wanted
to
go
to
war
but
was
not
permitted
it
was
then
that
i
threw
myself
into
science
and
now
when
i
was
about
to
reach
out
my
hand
to
gather
in
its
fruits
you
chop
off
my
arm
now
i
am
dishonored
and
can
live
no
longer
for
a
man
can
not
live
without
honor
laura
but
a
woman
captain
yes
for
she
has
her
children
which
he
has
not
but
like
the
rest
of
mankind
we
lived
our
lives
unconscious
as
children
full
of
imagination
ideals
and
illusions
and
then
we
awoke
it
was
all
over
but
we
awoke
with
our
feet
on
the
pillow
and
he
who
waked
us
was
himself
a
when
women
grow
old
and
cease
to
be
women
they
get
beards
on
their
chins
i
wonder
what
men
get
when
they
grow
old
and
cease
to
be
men
those
who
crowed
were
no
longer
cocks
but
capons
and
the
pullets
answered
their
call
so
that
when
we
thought
the
sun
was
about
to
rise
we
found
ourselves
in
the
bright
moon
light
amid
ruins
just
as
in
the
good
old
times
it
had
only
been
a
little
morning
slumber
with
wild
dreams
and
there
was
no
awakening
laura
do
you
know
you
should
have
been
a
poet
captain
who
knows
laura
now
i
am
sleepy
so
if
you
have
any
more
fantastic
visions
keep
them
till
captain
first
a
word
more
about
realities
do
you
hate
me
laura
yes
sometimes
when
you
are
a
man
captain
this
is
like
race
hatred
if
it
is
true
that
we
are
descended
from
monkeys
at
least
it
must
be
from
two
separate
species
we
are
certainly
not
like
one
another
are
we
laura
what
do
you
mean
to
say
by
all
this
captain
i
feel
that
one
of
us
must
go
under
in
this
struggle
laura
which
captain
the
weaker
of
course
laura
and
the
stronger
will
be
in
the
right
captain
always
since
he
has
the
power
laura
then
i
am
in
the
right
captain
have
you
the
power
already
then
laura
yes
and
a
legal
power
with
which
i
shall
put
you
under
the
control
of
a
guardian
captain
under
a
guardian
laura
and
then
i
shall
educate
my
child
without
listening
to
your
fantastic
notions
captain
and
who
will
pay
for
the
education
when
i
am
no
longer
here
laura
your
pension
will
pay
for
it
captain
threateningly
how
can
you
have
me
put
under
a
guardian
laura
takes
out
a
letter
with
this
letter
of
which
an
attested
copy
is
in
the
hands
of
the
board
of
lunacy
captain
what
letter
laura
moving
backward
toward
the
door
left
yours
your
declaration
to
the
doctor
that
you
are
insane
the
captain
stares
at
her
in
silence
now
you
have
fulfilled
your
function
as
an
unfortunately
necessary
father
and
breadwinner
you
are
not
needed
any
longer
and
you
must
go
you
must
go
since
you
have
realized
that
my
intellect
is
as
strong
as
my
will
and
since
you
will
not
stay
and
acknowledge
it
the
captain
goes
to
the
table
seizes
the
lighted
lamp
and
hurls
it
at
laura
who
disappears
backward
through
the
door

downright
stealing

you

walking
up

back

laura
is

door
well
barred
nurse
oh

good
evening
sister

have
been
away
all

as
you

only
just
got
back
terrible
things
have
been
happening
here
laura
yes
brother
never
have
i
gone
through
such
a
night
and
such
a
day
pastor
i
see
that
you
are
none
the
worse
for
it
all
laura
no
god
be
praised
but
think
what
might
have
happened
pastor
tell
me
one
thing
how
did
it
begin
i
have
heard
so
many
different
versions
laura
it
began
with
his
wild
idea
of
not
being
bertha
father
and
ended
with
his
throwing
the
lighted
lamp
in
my
face
pastor
but
this
is
dreadful
it
is
fully
developed
insanity
and
what
is
to
be
done
now
laura
we
must
try
to
prevent
further
violence
and
the
doctor
has
sent
to
the
hospital
for
a
straightjacket
in
the
meantime
i
have
sent
a
message
to
the
colonel
and
i
am
now
trying
to
straighten
out
the
affairs
of
the
household
which
he
has
carried
on
in
a
most
reprehensible
manner
pastor
this
is
a
deplorable
story
but
i
have
always
expected
something
of
the
sort
fire
and
powder
must
end
in
an
explosion
what
have
you
got
in
the
drawer
there
laura
has
pulled
out
a
drawer
in
the
desk
look
he
has
hidden
everything
here
pastor
looking
into
drawer
good
heavens
here
is
your
doll
and
here
is
your
christening
cap
and
bertha
rattle
and
your
letters
and
the
locket
wipes
his
eyes
after
all
he
must
have
loved
you
very
dearly
laura
i
never
kept
such
things
laura
i
believe
he
used
to
love
me
but
time
time
changes
so
many
things
pastor
what
is
that
big
paper
the
receipt
for
a
grave
yes
better
the
grave
than
the
lunatic
asylum
laura
tell
me
are
you
blameless
in
all
this
laura
i
why
should
i
be
to
blame
because
a
man
goes
out
of
his
mind
pastor
well
well
i
sha
say
anything
after
all
blood
is
thicker
than
water
laura
what
do
you
dare
to
intimate
pastor
looking
at
her
penetratingly
now
listen
laura
yes
pastor
you
can
hardly
deny
that
it
suits
you
pretty
well
to
be
able
to
educate
your
child
as
you
wish
laura
i
do
understand
pastor
how
i
admire
you
laura
me
h
pastor
and
i
am
to
become
the
guardian
of
that
do
you
know
i
have
always
looked
on
him
as
a
weed
in
our
garden
laura
gives
a
short
laugh
and
then
becomes
suddenly
serious
laura
and
you
dare
say
that
to
me
his
wife
pastor
you
are
strong
laura
incredibly
strong
you
are
like
a
fox
in
a
trap
you
would
rather
gnaw
off
your
own
leg
than
let
yourself
be
caught
like
a
master
thief
no
accomplice
not
even
your
own
conscience
look
at
yourself
in
the
glass
you
dare
not
laura
i
never
use
a
looking
glass
pastor
no
you
dare
not
let
me
look
at
your
hand
not
a
blood
stain
not
a
trace
of
insidious
poison
a
little
innocent
murder
that
the
law
can
not
reach
an
unconscious
crime
unconscious
what
a
splendid
idea
do
you
hear
how
he
is
working
up
there
take
care
if
that
man
gets
loose
he
will
make
short
work
of
you
laura
you
talk
so
much
you
must
have
a
bad
conscience
accuse
me
if
you
can
pastor
i
can
not
laura
you
see
you
can
not
and
therefore
i
am
innocent
you
take
care
of
your
ward
and
i
will
take
care
of
mine
here
the
doctor
doctor
comes
in
laura
rising
good
evening
doctor
you
at
least
will
help
me
you
but
unfortunately
there
is
not
much
that
can
be
done
do
you
hear
how
he
is
carrying
on
up
there
are
you
convinced
now
doctor
i
am
convinced
that
an
act
of
violence
has
been
committed
but
the
question
now
is
whether
that
act
of
violence
can
be
considered
an
outbreak
of
passion
or
madness
pastor
but
apart
from
the
actual
outbreak
you
must
acknowledge
that
he
has
fixed
ideas
doctor
i
think
that
your
ideas
pastor
are
much
more
fixed
pastor
my
settled
views
about
the
highest
things
are
doctor
we
leave
settled
views
out
of
this
madam
it
rests
with
you
to
decide
whether
your
husband
is
guilty
to
the
extent
of
imprisonment
and
fine
or
should
be
put
in
an
asylum
how
do
you
class
his
behavior
laura
i
can
not
answer
that
now
doctor
that
is
to
say
you
have
no
decided
opinion
as
to
what
will
be
most
advantageous
to
the
interests
of
the
family
what
do
you
say
pastor
pastor
well
there
will
be
a
scandal
in
either
case
it
is
not
easy
to
say
laura
but
if
he
is
only
sentenced
to
a
fine
for
violence
he
will
be
able
to
repeat
the
violence
doctor
and
if
he
is
sent
to
prison
he
will
soon
be
out
again
therefore
we
consider
it
most
advantageous
for
all
parties
that
he
should
be
immediately
treated
as
insane
where
is
the
nurse
laura
why
doctor
she
must
put
the
straightjacket
on
the
patient
when
i
have
talked
to
him
and
given
the
order
but
not
before
i
have
the
garment
out
here
goes
out
into
the
hall
rind

a
large
bundle

the
nurse

you

pay
attention
to
this
we
want
you
to
slip
this
jacket
on
the
captain
from
behind
you
understand
when
i
find
it
necessary
to
prevent
another
outbreak
of
violence
you
notice
it
has
very
long
sleeves
to
prevent
his
moving
and
they
are
to
be
tied
at
the
back
here
are
two
straps
that
go
through
buckles
which
are
afterwards
fastened
to
the
arm
of
a
chair
or
the
sofa
or
whatever
is
convenient
will
you
do
it
nurse
no
doctor
i
ca
do
that
i
ca
laura
why
do
you
do
it
yourself
doctor
doctor
because
the
patient
distrusts
me
you
madam
would
seem
to
be
the
one
to
do
it
but
i
fear
he
distrusts
even
you
laura
face
changes
for
an
instant
doctor

care
of
him

if

anything
i
can
do
for
the
captain

will
do
it
doctor
you
must
put
this
jacket
on
him
nurse
no
he
sha
touch
him
n√∂jd

hurt

i

very
gently

do
that

moment
the

forced
open
with
such
violence
that
the
lock
is
broken
and
the
chair
is
thrown
into
the
middle
of
the
room
the
captain
comes
in
with
a
pile
of
books
under
his
arm
which
he
puts
on
the
table
captain
the
whole
thing
is
to
be
read
here
in
every
book
so
i
out
of
my
mind
after
all
here
it
is
in
the
odyssey
book
first
verse
page
of
the
upsala
translation
it
is
telemachus
speaking
to
athene
my
mother
indeed
maintains
that
he
odysseus
is
my
father
but
i
myself
know
it
not
for
no
man
yet
hath
known
his
own
origin
and
this
suspicion
is
harbored
by
telemachus
about
penelope
the
most
virtuous
of
women
beautiful
eh
and
here
we
have
the
prophet
ezekiel
the
fool
saith
behold
here
is
my
father
but
who
can
tell
whose
loins
engendered
him
that
quite
clear
and

alexander
puschkin
greatest
poet
died
of
torture

breast
from
a
duel
on
his

was
innocent
ass

answered
when
an
english
lady

about
irishmen
who
used
to
throw
lighted
lamps
in
their
wives
faces
god
what
women
i
cried
women
she
gasped
yes
of
course
i
answered
when
things
go
so
far
that
a
man
a
man
who
loved
and
worshipped
a
woman
takes
a
lighted
lamp
and
throws
it
in
her
face
then
one
may
know
pastor

was
it
with
your
marriage
bed
did
you
have
a
lieutenant
in
the
house
eh
wait
a
moment
and
i
will
make
a
guess
his
name
was
whispers
in
the
ear
you
see
he
turns
pale
too
do
be
disturbed
she
is
dead
and
buried
and
what
is
done
ca
be
undone
i
knew
him
well
by
the
way
and
he
is
now
look
at
me
doctor
no
straight

eyes
a
major
in
the
cavalry
by
god

has
horns
too
doctor
tortured
captain
wo
you
talk
about
something
else
captain
do

wants
to
talk
of
something
else
when
i
mention
horns
pastor
do
you
know
adolf
that
you
are
insane
captain
yes

know
that
well

if
i
only
had
the
handling
of
your
illustrious
brains
for
awhile
i
soon
have
you
shut
up
too
i
am
mad
but
how
did
i
become
so
that
does
concern
you
and
it
concern
anyone
but
you
want
to
talk
of
something
else
now
takes
the
photograph
album
from
the
table
good
lord
that
is
my
child
mine
we
can
never
know
do
you
know
what
we
would
have
to
do
to
make
sure
first
one
should
marry
to
get
the
respect
of
society
then
be
divorced
soon
after
and
become
lovers
and
finally
adopt
the
children
then
one
would
at
least
be
sure
that
they
were
one
adopted
children
is
that
right
but
how
can
all
that
help
us
now
what
can
keep
me
now
that
you
have
taken
my
conception
of
immortality
from
me
what
use
is
science
and
philosophy
to
me
when
i
have
nothing
to
live
for
what
can
i
do
with
life
when
i
am
dishonored
i
grafted
my
right
arm
half
my
brain
half
my
marrow
on
another
trunk
for
i
believed
they
would
knit
themselves
together
and
grow
into
a
more
perfect
tree
and
then
someone
came
with
a
knife
and
cut
below
the
graft
and
now
i
am
only
half
a
tree
but
the
other
half
goes
on
growing
with
my
arm
and
half
my
brain
while
i
wither
and
die
for
they
were
the
best
parts
i
gave
away
now
i
want
to
die
do
with
me
as
you
will
i
am
no

little
boy
and
i
tucked
you
in
at
night
and
used
to
repeat
god
who
holds
his
children
dear
to
you
and
do
you
remember
how
i
used
to
get
up
in
the
night
and
give
you
a
drink
how
i
would
light
the
candle
and
tell
you
stories
when
you
had
bad
dreams
and
could
sleep
do
you
remember
all
that
captain
go
on
talking
margret
it
soothes
my
head
so
tell
me
some
more
nurse
o
yes
but
you
must
listen
then
do
you
remember
when
you
took
the
big
kitchen
knife
and
wanted
to
cut
out
boats
with
it
and
how
i
came
in
and
had
to
get
the
knife
away
by
fooling
you
you
were
just
a
little
child
who
did
understand
so
i
had
to
fool
you
for
you
know
that
it
was
for
your
own
good
give
me
that
snake
i
said
or
it
will
bite
you
and
then
you
let
go
of
the
knife
takes
the
revolver
out
of
the
captain
hand
and
then
when
you
had
to
be
dressed
and
did
want
to
i
had
to
coax
you
and
say
that
you
should
have
a
coat
of
gold
and
be
dressed
like
a
prince
and
then
i
took
your
little
blouse
that
was
just
made
of
green
wool
and
held
it
in
front
of
you
and
said
in
with
both
arms
and
then
i
said
now
sit
nice
and
still
while
i
button
it
down
the
back
she
puts
the
straightjacket
on
and
then
i
said
get
up
now
and
walk
across
the
floor
like
a
good
boy
so
i
can
see
how
it
fits
she
leads
him
to
the
sofa
and
then
i
said
now
you
must
go
to
bed
captain

did
you
say
was
i
to
go
to
bed
when
i
was
dressed

adolf

but
i
wanted
to
keep
you
from
killing
your
child
captain
why
did
you
let
me
you
say
life
is
hell
and
death
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
children
belong
to
heaven
nurse
how
do
you
know
what
comes
after
death
captain
that
is
the
only
thing
we
do
know
but
of
life
we
know
nothing
oh
if
one
had
only
known
from
the
beginning
nurse
adolf
humble
your
hard
heart
and
cry
to
god
for
mercy
it
is
not
yet
too
late
it
was
not
too
late
for
the
thief
on
the
cross
when
the
saviour
said
today
shalt
thou
be
with
me
in
paradise
captain
are
you
croaking
for
a
corpse
already
you
old
crow
nurse
takes
a
hymnbook
out
of
her
pocket
captain
calls
n√∂jd
is
n√∂jd
out
there
n√∂jd
comes
in
captain
throw
this
woman
out
she
wants
to
suffocate
me
with
her
throw
her
out
of
the
window
or
up
the
chimney
or
anywhere
n√∂jd
looks
at
nurse
heaven
help
you
captain
but
i
ca
do
that
i
ca
if
it
were
only
six
men
but
a
woman
captain
ca
you
manage
one
woman
eh
n√∂jd
of
course
i
can
but
well
you
see
it
queer
but
one
never
wants
to
lay
hands
on
a
woman
captain
why
not
have
they
laid
hands
on
me
n√∂jd
yes
but
i
ca
captain
it
just
as
if
you
asked
me
to
strike
the
pastor
it
second
nature
like
religion
i
ca
laura
comes
in
she
motions
n√∂jd
to
go
captain
omphale
omphale
now
you
play
with
the
club
while
hercules
spins
your
wool
laura
goes
to
sofa
adolf
look
at
me
do
you
believe
that
i
am
your
enemy
captain
yes
i
do
i
believe
that
you
are
all
my
enemies
my
mother
was
my
enemy
when
she
did
not
want
to
bring
me
into
the
world
because
i
was
to
be
born
with
pain
and
she
robbed
my
embryonic
life
of
its
nourishment
and
made
a
weakling
of
me
my
sister
was
my
enemy
when
she
taught
me
that
i
must
be
submissive
to
her
the
first
woman
i
embraced
was
my
enemy
for
she
gave
me
ten
years
of
illness
in
return
for
the
love
i
gave
her
my
daughter
became
my
enemy
when
she
had
to
choose
between
me
and
you
and
you
my
wife
you
have
been
my
arch
enemy
because
you
never
let
up
on
me
till
i
lay
here
lifeless
laura
i
do
know
that
i
ever
thought
or
even
intended
what
you
think
i
did
it
may
be
that
a
dim
desire
to
get
rid
of
you
as
an
obstacle
lay
at
the
bottom
of
it
and
if
you
see
any
design
in
my
behavior
it
is
possible
that
it
existed
although
i
was
unconscious
of
it
i
have
never
thought
how
it
all
came
about
but
it
is
the
result
of
the
course
you
yourself
laid
out
and
before
god
and
my
conscience
i
feel
that
i
am
innocent
even
if
i
am
not
your
existence
has
lain
like
a
stone
on
my
heart
lain
so
heavily
that
i
tried
to
shake
off
the
oppressive
burden
this
is
the
truth
and
if
i
have
unconsciously
struck
you
down
i
ask
your
forgiveness
captain
all
that
sounds
plausible
but
how
does
it
help
me
and
whose
fault
is
it
perhaps
spiritual
marriages
formerly
one
married
a
wife
now
one
enters
into
partnership
with
a
business
woman
or
goes
to
live
with
a
friend
and
then
one
ruins
the
partner
and
dishonors
the
friend
what
has
become
of
love
healthy
sensuous
love
it
died
in
the
transformation
and
what
is
the
result
of
this
love
in
shares
payable
to
the
bearer
without
joint
liability
who
is
the
bearer
when
the
crash
comes
who
is
the
fleshly
father
of
the
spiritual
child
laura
and
as
for
your
suspicions
about
the
child
they
are
absolutely
groundless
captain
that
just
what
makes
it
so
horrible
if
at
least
there
were
any
grounds
for
them
it
would
be
something
to
get
hold
of
to
cling
to
now
there
are
only
shadows
that
hide
themselves
in
the
bushes
and
stick
out
their
heads
and
grin
it
is
like
fighting
with
the
air
or
firing
blank
cartridges
in
a
sham
fight
a
fatal
reality
would
have
called
forth
resistance
stirred
life
and
soul
to
action
but
now
my
thoughts
dissolve
into
air
and
my
brain
grinds
a
void
until
it
is
on
put
a
pillow
under
my
head
and
throw
something
over
me
i
am
cold
i
am
terribly
cold
laura
takes
her
shawl
and
spreads
it
over
him
nurse
goes
to
get
a
pillow
laura
give
me
your
hand
friend
captain
my
band
the
hand
that
you
have
bound
omphale
omphale
but
i
feel
your
shawl
against
my
mouth
it
is
as
warm
and
soft
as
your
arm
and
it
smells
of
vanilla
like
your
hair
when
you
were
young
laura
when
you
were
young
and
we
walked
in
the
birch
woods
with
the
primroses
and
the
thrushes
glorious
glorious
think
how
beautiful
life
was
and
what
it
is
now
you
did
want
to
have
it
like
this
nor
did
i
and
yet
it
happened
who
then
rules
over
life
laura
god
alone
rules
captain
the
god
of
strife
then
or
the
goddess
perhaps
take
away
the
cat
that
is
lying
on
me
take
it
away
nurse
brings
in

the
shawl

you
wanted
to
take
away
from

cunning
woman
champion
of
peace
and
contriver
of
man
disarmament
wake
hercules
before
they
take
your
club
away
from
you
you
would
wile
our
armor

it
is
nothing
but
glittering
finery
no

was
iron
let
me
tell
you
before
it
ever
glittered
in
olden
days
the
smith
made
the
armor

the

fallen

treacherous
weakness

crazy
again
perfectly
crazy
kristin
so
you
back
at
last
jean
i
went
to
the
station
with
the
count
and
coming
back
i
went
in
to
the
barn
and
danced
and
then
i
discovered
miss
julie
there
leading
the
dance
with
the
gamekeeper
when
she
spied
me
she
rushed
right
toward
me
and
asked
me
to
waltz
and
then
she
waltzed
so
never
in
my
life
have
i
seen
anything
like
it
ah
she
is
crazy
tonight
kristin
she
has
always
been
but
never
so
much
as
in
the
last
fortnight
since
her
engagement
was
broken
off
jean
yes
what
about
that
gossip
he
seemed
like
a
fine
fellow
although
he
was
rich
ach
they
have
so
much
nonsense
about
them
seats
himself
at
table
it
queer
about
miss
julie
though
to
prefer
staying
here
at
home
among
these
people
eh
to
going
away
with
her
father
to
visit
her
relatives
eh
kristin
she
probably
shamefaced
about
breaking
off
with
her
intended
jean
no
doubt
but
he
was
a
likely
sort
just
the
same
do
you
know
kristin
how
it
happened
i
saw
it
although
i
did
let
on
kristin
no
did
you
see
it
jean
yes
indeed
i
did
they
were
out
in
the
stable
yard
one
evening
and
she
was
training
him
as
she
called
it
do
you
know
what
happened
she
made
him
leap
over
her
riding
whip
the
way
you
teach
a
dog
to
jump
he
jumped
it
twice
and
got
a
lash
each
time
but
the
third
time
he
snatched
the
whip
from
her
hand
and
broke
it
into
pieces
and
then
he
vanished
kristin
was
that
the
way
it
happened
no
you
do
say
so
jean
yes
that
the
way
the
thing
happened
but
what
have
you
got
to
give
me
that
good
kristin
kristin
she
takes
things
from
the
pans
on
stove
and
serves
them
to
him
oh
it
only
a
bit
of
kidney
that
i
cut
out
of
the
veal
steak
for
you
jean
smelling
the
food
splendid
my
favorite
delicacy
feeling
of
plate
but
you
might
have
warmed
the
plate
kristin
you
fussier
than
the
count
when
you
get
started
tweaks
his
hair
jean
do
pull
my
hair
you
know
how
sensitive
i
am
kristin
oh
there
there
you
know
i
was
only
loving
you
jean
eats
and
kristin
opens
bottle
of
beer
jean
beer
on
midsummer
night
thank
you
no
i
have
something
better
than
that
myself
takes
bottle
of
wine
from
drawer
of
table
yellow
seal
how
that
now
give
me
a
glass
a
wine
glass
you
understand
of
course
when
one
drinks
the
genuine
kristin
fetches
a
glass
then
goes
to
stove
and
puts
on
casserole
heaven
help
the
woman
who
gets
you
for
her
husband
such
a
fuss
budget
jean
oh
talk
you
ought
to
be
glad
to
get
such
a
fine
fellow
as
i
am
and
i
do
think
it
done
you
any
harm
because
i
considered
your
intended
tastes
wine
excellent
very
excellent
just
a
little
too
cold
warms
glass
with
hands
we
bought
this
at
dijon
it
stood
at
four
francs
a
litre
in
the
bulk
then
of
course
there
was
the
duty
besides
what
are
you
cooking
now
that
smells
so
infernally
kristin
oh
it
some
devil
mess
that
miss
julie
must
have
for
diana
jean
take
care
of
your
words
kristin
but
why
should
you
stand
there
cooking
for
that
damned
dog
on
a
holiday
evening
is
it
sick
eh
kristin
yes
it
sick
diana
sneaked
out
with
the
mongrels
and
now
something
is
wrong
miss
julie
ca
stand
that
jean
miss
julie
has
a
great
deal
of
pride
about
some
things
but
not
enough
about
others
just
like
her
mother
in
her
lifetime
she
thrived
best
in
the
kitchen
or
the
stable
but
she
must
always
drive
tandem
never
one
horse
she
would
go
about
with
soiled
cuffs
but
she
had
to
have
the
count
crest
on
her
cuff
buttons
and
as
for
miss
julie
she
does
take
much
care
of
her
appearance
either
i
should
say
she
is
refined
why
just
now
out
there
she
pulled
the
forester
from
anna
side
and
asked
him
to
dance
with
her
we
would
do
things
that
way
but
when
the
highborn
wish
to
unbend
they
become
vulgar
splendid
she
is
though
magnificent
ah
such
shoulders
and
kristin
oh
do
exaggerate
i
heard
what
clara
says
who
dresses
her
sometimes
i
have
jean
ha
clara
you
women
are
always
jealous
of
each
other
i
been
out
riding
with
her

miss

in
doorway

for
me
jean
quickly
puts
bottle
in
table
drawer
and
rises
very
respectfully
enter
miss
julie
and
goes
to
kristin
julie
is
it
done
kristin
indicating
jean
presence
jean
gallantly
have
you
secrets
between
you
julie
flipping
handkerchief
in
his
face
curious
are
you
jean
how
sweet
that
violet
perfume
is
julie
coquettishly
impudence
do
you
appreciate
perfumes
too
dance
that
you
can
do
splendidly
jean
looks
towards
the
cooking
stove
do
look
away
with
you
jean
inquisitive
but
polite
is
it
some
troll
dish
that
you
are
both
concocting
for
midsummer
night
something
to
pierce
the
future
with
and
evoke
the
face
of
your
intended
julie
sharply
to
see
him
one
must
have
sharp
eyes
to
kristin
put
it
into
a
bottle
and
cork
it
tight
come
now
jean
and
dance
a
schottische
with
me
jean
hesitates
jean
i
do
wish
to
be
impolite
to
anyone
but
this
dance
i
promised
to
kristin
julie
oh
she
can
have
another
is
that
so
kristin
wo
you
lend
jean
to
me
kristin
it
not
for
me
to
say
if
miss
julie
is
so
gracious
it
not
for
me
to
say
no
to
jean
go
you
and
be
grateful
for
the
honor
jean
well
said
but
not
wishing
any
offense
i
wonder
if
it
is
prudent
for
miss
julie
to
dance
twice
in
succession
with
her
servant
especially
as
people
are
never
slow
to
find
meaning
in
julie
breaking
out
in
what
what
sort
of
meaning
what
were
you
going
to
say
jean
taken
aback
since
miss
julie
does
not
understand
i
must
speak
plainly
it
may
look
strange
to
prefer
one
of
your
underlings
to
others
who
covet
the
same
honor
julie
to
prefer
what
a
thought
i
the
lady
of
the
house
i
honor
the
people
with
my
presence
and
now
that
i
feel
like
dancing
i
want
to
have
a
partner
who
knows
how
to
lead
to
avoid
being
ridiculous
jean
as
miss
julie
commands
i
here
to
serve
julie
mildly
you
must
look
upon
that
as
a
command
tonight
we
are
all
in
holiday
spirits
full
of
gladness
and
rank
is
flung
aside
so
give
me
your
arm
do
be
alarmed
kristin
i
shall
not
take
your
sweetheart
away
from
you

with
which
she
crimps
her
hair
around

listens
then
she
returns

in
black
frock
coat
julie
tres
gentil
monsieur
jean
tres
gentil
jean
vous
voulez
plaisanter
mademoiselle
julie
et
vous
voulez
parler
francais
where
did
you
learn
that
jean
in
switzerland
where
i
was
butler
in
the
largest
hotel
at
lucerne
julie
why
you
look
like
a
gentleman
in
your
frock
coat
charmant
seats
herself
by
table
jean
you
flatter
me
julie
flatter
picking
him
up
on
the
word
jean
my
natural
modesty
forbids
me
to
believe
that
you
could
mean
these
pleasant
things
that
you
say
to
a
such
as
i
am
and
therefore
i
allowed
myself
to
fancy
that
you
overrate
or
as
it
is
called
flatter
julie
where
did
you
learn
to
use
words
like
that
have
you
frequented
the
theatres
much
jean
i
have
frequented
many
places
i
have
julie
but
you
were
born
here
in
this
neighborhood
jean
my
father
was
a
deputy
under
the
public
prosecutor
and
i
saw
miss
julie
as
a
child
although
she
did
see
me
julie
no
really
jean
yes
i
remember
one
time
in
particular
but
i
must
talk
about
that
julie
oh
yes
do
when
was
it
jean
no
really
not
now
another
time
perhaps
julie
another
time
is
a
good
for
nothing
is
it
so
dreadful
then
jean
not
dreadful
but
it
goes
against
the
grain
turns
and
points
to
kristin
who
has
fallen
asleep
in
a
chair
near
stove
look
at
her
julie
she
make
a
charming
wife
does
she
snore
too
jean
no
but
she
talks
in
her
sleep
julie
cynically
how
do
you
know
that
she
talks
in
her
sleep
jean
boldly
i
have
heard
her
pause
and
they
look
at
each
other
julie
why
do
you
sit
down
jean
i
ca
allow
myself
to
do
so
in
your
presence
julie
but
if
i
command
you
jean
then
i
obey
julie
sit
down
then
but
wait
ca
you
get
me
something
to
drink
first
jean
i
do
know
what
there
is
in
the
icebox
nothing
but
beer
probably
julie
is
beer
nothing
my
taste
is
so
simple
that
i
prefer
it
to
wine
jean
takes
out
beer
and
serves
it
on
plate
jean
allow
me
julie
wo
you
drink
too
jean
i
am
no
friend
to
beer
but
if
miss
julie
commands
julie
gaily
commands
i
should
think
as
a
polite
cavalier
you
might
join
your
lady
jean
looking
at
it
in
that
way
you
are
quite
right
opens
another
bottle
of
beer
and
fills
glass
julie
give
me
a
toast
jean
hesitates
julie
mockingly
old
as
he
is
i
believe
the
man
is
bashful
jean
on
his
knee
with
mock
gallantry
raises
glass
a
health
to
my
lady
of
the
house
julie
bravo
now
you
must
kiss
my
slipper
then
the
thing
is
perfect
jean
hesitates
and
then
seizes
her
foot
and
kisses
it
lightly
julie
splendid
you
should
have
been
an
actor
jean
rising
but
this
must
go
any
further
miss
julie
what
if
someone
should
come
in
and
see
us
julie
what
harm
would
that
do
jean
simply
that
it
would
give
them
a
chance
to
gossip
and
if
miss
julie
only
knew
how
their
tongues
wagged
just
now
then
julie
what
did
they
say
tell
me
and
sit
down
now
jean
sitting
i
do
wish
to
hurt
you
but
they
used
an
expression
threw
hints
of
a
certain
kind
but
you
are
not
a
child
you
can
understand
when
one
sees
a
lady
drinking
alone
with
a
man
let
alone
a
servant
at
night
then
julie
then
what
and
for
that
matter
we
are
not
alone
kristin
is
here
jean
sleeping
yes
julie
then
i
shall
wake
her
rises
kristin
are
you
asleep
kristin
in
her
sleep
bla
bla
bla
bla
julie
kristin
she
certainly
can
sleep
goes
to
kristin
kristin
in
her
sleep
the
count
boots
are
polished
put
on
the
coffee
soon
soon
soon
oh
puh
breathes
heavily
julie
takes
her
by
the
nose
julie
wo
you
wake
up
jean
sternly
do
disturb
the
sleeping
julie
sharply
what
jean
anyone
who
has
stood
over
the
hot
stove
all
day
long
is
tired
when
night
comes
one
should
respect
the
weary
julie
that
a
kind
thought
and
i
honor
it
offers
her
hand
thanks
for
the
suggestion
come
out
with
me
now
and
pick
some
syringas
kristin
has
awakened
and
goes
to
her
room
right
in
a
sort
of
sleep
stupified
way
jean
with
miss
julie
julie
with
me
jean
but
that
would
do
decidedly
not
julie
i
do
understand
you
is
it
possible
that
you
fancy
that
i
jean
no
not
i
but
people
julie
what
that
i
in
love
with
my
coachman
jean
i
am
not
presumptuous
but
we
have
seen
instances
and
with
the
people
nothing
is
sacred
julie
i
believe
he
is
an
aristocrat
jean
yes
i
am
julie
but
i
step
down
jean
do
step
down
miss
julie
listen
to
me
no
one
would
believe
that
you
stepped
down
of
your
own
accord
people
always
say
that
one
falls
down
julie
i
think
better
of
the
people
than
you
do
come
and
try
them
come
dares
him
with
a
look
jean
do
you
know
that
you
are
wonderful
julie
perhaps
but
you
are
too
everything
is
wonderful
for
that
matter
life
people
everything
everything
is
wreckage
that
drifts
over
the
water
until
it
sinks
sinks
i
have
the
same
dream
every
now
and
then
and
at
this
moment
i
am
reminded
of
it
i
find
myself
seated
at
the
top
of
a
high
pillar
and
i
see
no
possible
way
to
get
down
i
grow
dizzy
when
i
look
down
but
down
i
must
but
i
not
brave
enough
to
throw
myself
i
can
not
hold
fast
and
i
long
to
fall
but
i
do
fall
and
yet
i
can
find
no
rest
or
peace
until
i
shall
come
down
to
earth
and
if
i
came
down
to
earth
i
would
wish
myself
down
in
the
ground
have
you
ever
felt
like
that
jean
no
i
dream
that
i
lying
in
a
dark
wood
under
a
tall
tree
and
i
would
up
up
to
the
top
where
i
can
look
far
over
the
fair
landscape
where
the
sun
is
shining
i
climb
climb
to
plunder
the
birds
nests
up
there
where
the
golden
eggs
lie
but
the
tree
trunk
is
so
thick
so
smooth
and
the
first
limb
is
so
high
but
i
know
if
i
reached
the
first
limb
i
should
climb
as
though
on
a
ladder
to
the
top
i
have
reached
it
yet
but
i
shall
reach
it
if
only
in
the
dream
julie
here
i
stand
talking
about
dreams
with
you
come
now
just
out
in
the
park
she
offers
her
arm
and
they
start
jean
we
should
sleep
on
nine
midsummer
flowers
tonight
and
then
our
dreams
would
come
true
she
turns
jean
quickly
holds
a
hand
over
his
eye
julie
what
is
it
something
in
your
eye
jean
oh
it
is
nothing
just
a
speck
it
will
be
all
right
in
a
moment
julie
it
was
some
dust
from
my
sleeve
that
brushed
against
you
now
sit
down
and
let
me
look
for
it
pulls
him
into
a
chair
looks
into
his
eye
now
sit
still
perfectly
still
uses
corner
of
her
handkerchief
in
his
eye
strikes
his
hand
so
will
you
mind
i
believe
you
are
trembling
strong
man
that
you
are
touching
his
arm
and
such
arms
jean
warningly
miss
julie
julie
yes
monsieur
jean
jean
attention
je
ne
suis
homme
julie
will
you
sit
still
so
now
it
is
gone
kiss
my
hand
and
thank
me
jean
rises
jean
miss
julie
listen
to
me
kristin
has
gone
to
bed
now
will
you
listen
to
me
julie
kiss
my
hand
first
jean
listen
to
me
julie
kiss
my
hand
first
jean
yes
but
blame
yourself
julie
for
what
jean
for
what
are
you
a
child
at
do
you
know
that
it
is
dangerous
to
play
with
fire
julie
not
for
me
i
am
insured
jean
no
you
are
not
but
even
if
you
are
there
is
inflammable
material
in
the
neighborhood
julie
might
that
be
you
jean
yes
not
because
it
is
i
but
because
i
a
young
man
julie
scornfully
with
a
grand
opportunity
what
inconceivable
presumption
a
don
juan
perhaps
or
a
joseph
on
my
soul
i
believe
he
is
a
joseph
jean
you
do
julie
almost
jean
rushes
towards
her
and
tries
to
take
her
in
his
arms
to
kiss
her
julie
gives
him
a
box
on
the
ear
shame
on
you
jean
are
you
in
earnest
or
fooling
julie
in
earnest
jean
then
you
were
in
earnest
a
moment
ago
too
you
play
too
seriously
with
what
is
dangerous
now
i
tired
of
playing
and
beg
to
be
excused
that
i
may
go
on
with
my
work
the
count
must
have
his
boots
in
time
and
it
is
long
past
midnight
jean
picks
up
boots
julie
put
those
boots
away
jean
no
that
is
my
work
which
it
is
my
duty
to
do
but
i
was
not
hired
to
be
your
play
thing
and
that
i
shall
never
be
i
think
too
well
of
myself
for
that
julie
you
are
proud
jean
in
some
things
not
in
others
julie
were
you
ever
in
love
jean
we
do
not
use
that
word
but
i
have
liked
many
girls
one
time
i
was
sick
because
i
could
have
the
one
i
wanted
sick
you
understand
like
the
princesses
in
the
arabian
nights
who
could
not
eat
nor
drink
for
love
sickness
julie
who
was
she
jean
is
silent
who
was
she
jean
that
you
could
not
make
me
tell
julie
not
if
i
ask
you
as
an
equal
as
a
friend
who
was
she
jean
it
was
you
julie
seats
herself
julie
how
extravagant
jean
yes
if
you
will
it
was
ridiculous
that
was
the
story
i
hesitated
to
tell
but
now
i
going
to
tell
it
do
you
know
how
people
in
high
life
look
from
the
under
world
no
of
course
you
do
they
look
like
hawks
and
eagles
whose
backs
one
seldom
sees
for
they
soar
up
above
i
lived
in
a
hovel
provided
by
the
state
with
seven
brothers
and
sisters
and
a
pig
out
on
a
barren
stretch
where
nothing
grew
not
even
a
tree
but
from
the
window
i
could
see
the
count
park
walls
with
apple
trees
rising
above
them
that
was
the
garden
of
paradise
and
there
stood
many
angry
angels
with
flaming
swords
protecting
it
but
for
all
that
i
and
other
boys
found
the
way
to
the
tree
of
life
now
you
despise
me
julie
oh
all
boys
steal
apples
jean
you
say
that
but
you
despise
me
all
the
same
no
matter
one
time
i
entered
the
garden
of
paradise
it
was
to
weed
the
onion
beds
with
my
mother
near
the
orchard
stood
a
turkish
pavilion
shaded
and
overgrown
with
jessamine
and
honeysuckle
i
did
know
what
it
was
used
for
and
i
had
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
people
passed
in
and
out
and
one
day
the
door
was
left
open
i
sneaked
in
and
beheld
walls
covered
with
pictures
of
kings
and
emperors
and
there
were
curtains
at
the
windows
now
you
understand
what
i
mean
i
breaks
off
a
spray
of
syringes
and
puts
it
to
her
nostrils
i
had
never
been
in
the
castle
and
how
my
thoughts
leaped
and
there
they
returned
ever
after
little
by
little
the
longing
came
over
me
to
experience
for
once
the
pleasure
of
enfin
i
sneaked
in
and
was
bewildered
but
then
i
heard
someone
coming
there
was
only
one
exit
for
the
great
folk
but
for
me
there
was
another
and
i
had
to
choose
that
julie
who
has
taken
the
syringa
lets
it
fall
on
table
once
out
i
started
to
run
scrambled
through
a
raspberry
hedge
rushed
over
a
strawberry
bed
and
came
to
a
stop
on
the
rose
terrace
for
there
i
saw
a
figure
in
a
white
dress
and
white
slippers
and
stockings
it
was
you
i
hid
under
a
heap
of
weeds
under
you
understand
where
the
thistles
pricked
me
and
lay
on
the
damp
rank
earth
i
gazed
at
you
walking
among
the
roses
and
i
thought
if
it
is
true
that
the
thief
on
the
cross
could
enter
heaven
and
dwell
among
the
angels
it
was
strange
that
a
pauper
child
on
god
earth
could
not
go
into
the
castle
park
and
play
with
the
countess
daughter
julie
pensively
do
you
believe
that
all
poor
children
would
have
such
thoughts
under
those
conditions
jean
hesitates
then
in
a
positive
voice
that
all
poor
children
yes
of
course
of
course
julie
it
must
be
a
terrible
misfortune
to
be
poor
jean
with
deep
pain
and
great
chagrin
oh
miss
julie
a
dog
may
lie
on
the
couch
of
a
countess
a
horse
may
be
caressed
by
a
lady
hand
but
a
servant
yes
yes
sometimes
there
is
stuff
enough
in
a
man
whatever
he
be
to
swing
himself
up
in
the
world
but
how
often
does
that
happen
but
to
return
to
the
story
do
you
know
what
i
did
i
ran
down
to
the
mill
dam
and
threw
myself
in
with
my
clothes
on
and
was
pulled
out
and
got
a
thrashing
but
the
following
sunday
when
all
the
family
went
to
visit
my
grandmother
i
contrived
to
stay
at
home
i
scrubbed
myself
well
put
on
my
best
clothes
such
as
they
were
and
went
to
church
so
that
i
might
see
you
i
saw
you
then
i
went
home
with
my
mind
made
up
to
put
an
end
to
myself
but
i
wanted
to
do
it
beautifully
and
without
pain
then
i
happened
to
remember
that
elderberry
blossoms
are
poisonous
i
knew
where
there
was
a
big
elderberry
bush
in
full
bloom
and
i
stripped
it
of
its
riches
and
made
a
bed
of
it
in
the
have
you
ever
noticed
how
smooth
and
glossy
oats
are
as
soft
as
a
woman
well
i
got
in
and
let
down
the
cover
fell
asleep
and
when
i
awoke
i
was
very
ill
but
did
die
as
you
see
what
i
wanted
i
do
know
you
were
unattainable
but
through
the
vision
of
you
i
was
made
to
realize
how
hopeless
it
was
to
rise
above
the
conditions
of
my
birth
julie
you
tell
it
well
were
you
ever
at
school
jean
a
little
but
i
have
read
a
good
deal
and
gone
to
the
theatres
and
besides
i
have
always
heard
the
talk
of
fine
folks
and
from
them
i
have
learned
most
julie
do
you
listen
then
to
what
we
are
saying
jean
yes
indeed
i
do
and
i
have
heard
much
when
i
been
on
the
coachbox
one
time
i
heard
miss
julie
and
a
lady
julie
oh
what
was
it
you
heard
jean
hm
that
not
so
easy
to
tell
but
i
was
astonished
and
could
not
understand
where
you
had
heard
such
things
well
perhaps
at
bottom
there
not
so
much
difference
between
people
and
people
julie
oh
shame
we
do
behave
as
you
do
when
we
are
engaged
jean
eyeing
her
are
you
sure
of
that
it
is
worthwhile
to
play
the
innocent
with
me
julie
i
gave
my
love
to
a
rascal
jean
that
what
they
always
say
afterward
julie
always
jean
always
i
believe
as
i
have
heard
the
expression
many
times
before
under
the
same
circumstances
julie
what
circumstances
jean
those
we
been
talking
about
the
last
time
i
julie
silence
i
do
wish
to
hear
any
more
jean
well
then
i
beg
to
be
excused
so
i
may
go
to
bed
julie
go
to
bed
on
midsummer
night
jean
yes
for
dancing
out
there
with
that
pack
has
not
amused
me
julie
then
get
the
key
for
the
boat
and
row
me
out
over
the
lake
i
want
to
see
the
sun
rise
jean
is
that
prudent
julie
one
would
think
that
you
were
afraid
of
your
reputation
jean
why
not
i
do
want
to
be
made
ridiculous
i
am
not
willing
to
be
driven
out
without
references
now
that
i
am
going
to
settle
down
and
i
feel
i
owe
something
to
kristin

my
advice

once
for
your
own
sake

irresponsible
and

of
the

formality
between

as
long
as
we
are
in
this
house

the
memory
of
the
past
and
there
is
the
count
your
father
i
have
never
known
anyone
else
for
whom
i
have
such
respect
i
need
only
to
see
his
gloves
lying
in
a
chair
to
feel
my
own
insignificance
i
have
only
to
hear
his
bell
to
start
like
a
nervous
horse
and
now
as
i
see
his
boots
standing
there
so
stiff
and
proper
i
feel
like
bowing
and
scraping
gives
boots
a
kick
superstitions
and
prejudices
taught
in
childhood
ca
be
uprooted
in
a
moment
let
us
go
to
a
country
that
is
a
republic
where
they
stand
on
their
heads
for
my
coachman
livery
on
their
heads
shall
they
stand
but
i
shall
not
i
am
not
born
to
bow
and
scrape
for
there
stuff
in
me
character
if
i
only
get
hold
of
the
first
limb
you
shall
see
me
climb
i
a
coachman
today
but
next
year
i
shall
be
a
proprietor
in
two
years
a
gentleman
of
income
then
for
roumania
where
i
let
them
decorate
me
and
can
mark
you
end
a
count
julie
beautiful
beautiful
jean
oh
in
roumania
one
can
buy
a
title
cheap
and
so
you
can
be
a
countess
just
the
same
my
countess
julie
what
do
i
care
for
all
that
which
i
now
cast
behind
me
say
that
you
love
me
else
what
am
i
without
it
jean
i
say
it
a
thousand
times
afterwards
but
not
here
above
all
let
us
have
no
sentimentality
now
or
everything
will
fall
through
we
must
look
at
this
matter
coldly
like
sensible
people
takes
out
a
cigar
and
lights
it
now
sit
down
there
and
i
sit
here
and
we
talk
it
over
as
if
nothing
had
happened
julie
staggered
oh
my
god
have
you
no
feeling
jean
i
no
one
living
has
more
feeling
than
i
but
i
can
restrain
myself
julie
a
moment
ago
you
could
kiss
my
slipper
and
now
jean
harshly
that
was
then
now
we
have
other
things
to
think
about
julie
do
speak
harshly
to
me
jean
not
harshly
but
wisely
one
folly
has
been
committed
commit
no
more
the
count
may
be
here
at
any
moment
and
before
he
comes
our
fate
must
be
settled
how
do
my
plans
for
the
future
strike
you
do
you
approve
of
them
julie
they
seem
acceptable
enough
but
one
question
for
such
a
great
undertaking
a
large
capital
is
necessary
have
you
that
jean
chewing
his
cigar
i
to
be
sure
i
have
my
regular
occupation
my
unusual
experience
my
knowledge
of
different
languages
that
is
capital
that
counts
i
should
say
julie
but
with
all
that
you
could
not
buy
a
railway
ticket
jean
that
true
and
for
that
reason
i
looking
for
a
backer
who
can
furnish
the
funds
julie
how
can
that
be
done
at
a
moment
notice
jean
that
is
for
you
to
say
if
you
wish
to
be
my
companion
julie
i
ca
as
i
have
nothing
myself
a
pause
jean
then
the
whole
matter
drops
julie
and
jean
things
remain
as
they
are
julie
do
you
think
i
could
remain
under
this
roof
after
do
you
think
i
will
allow
the
people
to
point
at
me
in
scorn
or
that
i
can
ever
look
my
father
in
the
face
again
never
take
me
away
from
this
humiliation
and
dishonor
oh
what
have
i
done
oh
my
god
what
have
i
done
weeping
jean
so
you
are
beginning
in
that
tune
now
what
have
you
done
the
same
as
many
before
you
julie
and
now
you
despise
me
i
am
falling
i
am
falling
jean
fall
down
to
my
level
i
lift
you
up
afterwards
julie
what
strange
power
drew
me
to
you
the
weak
to
the
strong
the
falling
to
the
rising
or
is
this
love
this
love
do
you
know
what
love
is
jean
i
yes
do
you
think
it
the
first
time
julie
what
language
what
thoughts
jean
i
am
what
life
has
made
me
do
be
nervous
and
play
the
high
and
mighty
for
now
we
are
on
the
same
level
look
here
my
little
girl
let
me
offer
you
a
glass
of
something
extra
fine

drawer
of
table
and
takes
out
wine

two
glasses

julie
crushed
that
is
right
strike
me
trample
on
me
i
deserve
nothing
better
i
have
done
wrong
but
help
me
now
help
me
out
of
this
if
there
is
any
possible
way
jean
softens
somewhat
i
do
care
to
shirk
my
share
of
the
blame
but
do
you
think
any
one
of
my
position
would
ever
have
dared
to
raise
his
eyes
to
you
if
you
yourself
had
not
invited
it
even
now
i
am
astonished
julie
and
proud
jean
why
not
although
i
must
confess
that
the
conquest
was
too
easy
to
be
exciting
julie
go
on
strike
me
again
jean
rising
no
forgive
me
rather
for
what
i
said
i
do
not
strike
the
unarmed
least
of
all
a
woman
but
i
ca
deny
that
from
a
certain
point
of
view
it
gives
me
satisfaction
to
know
that
it
is
the
glitter
of
brass
not
gold
that
dazzles
us
from
below
and
that
the
eagle
back
is
grey
like
the
rest
of
him
on
the
other
hand
i
sorry
to
have
to
realize
that
all
that
i
have
looked
up
to
is
not
worth
while
and
it
pains
me
to
see
you
fallen
lower
than
your
cook
as
it
pains
me
to
see
autumn
blossoms
whipped
to
pieces
by
the
cold
rain
and
transformed
into
dirt
julie
you
speak
as
though
you
were
already
my
superior
jean
and
so
i
am
for
i
can
make
you
a
countess
and
you
could
never
make
me
a
count
julie
but
i
am
born
of
a
count
that
you
can
never
be
jean
that
is
true
but
i
can
be
the
father
of
counts
if
julie
but
you
are
a
thief
that
i
am
not
jean
there
are
worse
things
than
that
and
for
that
matter
when
i
serve
in
a
house
i
regard
myself
as
a
member
of
the
family
a
child
of
the
house
as
it
were
and
one
does
consider
it
theft
if
children
snoop
a
berry
from
full
bushes
with
renewed
passion
miss
julie
you
are
a
glorious
woman
too
good
for
such
as
i
you
have
been
the
victim
of
an
infatuation
and
you
want
to
disguise
this
fault
by
fancying
that
you
love
me
but
you
do
not
unless
perhaps
my
outer
self
attracts
you
and
then
your
love
is
no
better
than
mine
but
i
can
not
be
satisfied
with
that
and
your
real
love
i
can
never
awaken
julie
are
you
sure
of
that
jean
you
mean
that
we
could
get
along
with
such
an
arrangement
no
doubt
about
my
loving
you
you
are
beautiful
you
are
elegant
goes
to
her
and
takes
her
hand
accomplished
lovable
when
you
wish
to
be
and
the
flame
that
you
awaken
in
man
does
not
die
easily
puts
arm
around
her
you
are
like
hot
wine
with
strong
spices
and
your
lips
tries
to
kiss
her
julie
pulls
herself
away
slowly
julie
leave
me
i
not
to
be
won
this
way
jean
how
then
not
with
caresses
and
beautiful
words
not
by
thoughts
for
the
future
to
save
humiliation
how
then
julie
how
i
do
know
i
do
know
i
shrink
from
you
as
i
would
from
a
rat
but
i
can
not
escape
from
you
jean
escape
with
me
julie
escape
yes
we
must
but
i
so
tired
give
me
a
glass
of
wine
jean
fills
a
glass
with
wine
julie
looks
at
her
watch
we
must
talk
it
over
first
for
we
have
still
a
little
time
left
she
empties
the
glass
and
puts
it
out
for
more
jean
do
drink
too
much
it
will
go
to
your
head
julie
what
harm
will
that
do
jean
what
harm
it
foolish
to
get
intoxicated
but
what
did
you
want
to
say
julie
we
must
go
away
but
we
must
talk
first
that
is
i
must
speak
for
until
now
you
have
done
all
the
talking
you
have
told
me
about
your
life
now
i
will
tell
you
about
mine
then
we
will
know
each
other
through
and
through
before
we
start
on
our
wandering
together
jean
one
moment
pardon
think
well
whether
you
wo
regret
having
told
your
life
secrets
julie
are
you
my
friend
jean
yes
sometimes
but
do
depend
on
me
julie
you
only
say
that
and
for
that
matter
i
have
no
secrets
you
see
my
mother
was
not
of
noble
birth
she
was
brought
up
with
ideas
of
equality
woman
freedom
and
all
that
she
had
very
decided
opinions
against
matrimony
and
when
my
father
courted
her
she
declared
that
she
would
never
be
his
wife
but
she
did
so
for
all
that
i
came
into
the
world
against
my
mother
wishes
i
discovered
and
was
brought
up
like
a
child
of
nature
by
my
mother
and
taught
everything
that
a
boy
must
know
as
well
i
was
to
be
an
example
of
a
woman
being
as
good
as
a
man
i
was
made
to
go
about
in
boy
clothes
and
take
care
of
the
horses
and
harness
and
saddle
and
hunt
and
all
such
things
in
fact
all
over
the
estate
women
servants
were
taught
to
do
men
work
with
the
result
that
the
property
came
near
being
ruined
and
so
we
became
the
laughing
stock
of
the
countryside
at
last
my
father
must
have
awakened
from
his
bewitched
condition
for
he
revolted
and
ran
things
according
to
his
ideas
my
mother
became
ill
what
it
was
i
do
know
but
she
often
had
cramps
and
acted
queerly
sometimes
hiding
in
the
attic
or
the
orchard
and
would
even
be
gone
all
night
at
times
then
came
the
big
fire
which
of
course
you
have
heard
about
the
house
the
stables
everything
was
burned
under
circumstances
that
pointed
strongly
to
an
incendiary
for
the
misfortune
happened
the
day
after
the
quarterly
insurance
was
due
and
the
premiums
sent
in
by
father
were
strangely
delayed
by
his
messenger
so
that
they
arrived
too
late
she
fills
a
wine
glass
and
drinks
jean
do
drink
any
more
julie
oh
what
does
it
matter
my
father
was
utterly
at
a
loss
to
know
where
to
get
money
to
rebuild
with
then
my
mother
suggested
that
he
try
to
borrow
from
a
man
who
had
been
her
friend
in
her
youth
a
brick
manufacturer
here
in
the
neighborhood
my
father
made
the
loan
but
was
allowed
to
pay
any
interest
which
surprised
him
then
the
house
was
rebuilt
julie
drinks
again
do
you
know
who
burned
the
house
jean
her
ladyship
your
mother
julie
do
you
know
who
the
brick
manufacturer
was
jean
your
mother
lover
julie
do
you
know
whose
money
it
was
jean
just
a
moment
that
i
do
know
julie
it
was
my
mother
jean
the
count
that
is
to
say
unless
there
was
a
contract
julie
there
was
no
contract
my
mother
had
some
money
which
she
had
not
wished
to
have
in
my
father
keeping
and
therefore
she
had
entrusted
it
to
her
friend
care
jean
who
kept
it
julie
quite
right
he
held
on
to
it
all
this
came
to
my
knowledge
he
could
proceed
against
him
was
allowed
to
pay
his
wife
friend
and
could
prove
that
it
was
his
wife
money
that
was
my
mother
revenge
for
his
taking
the
reins
of
the
establishment
into
his
own
hands
at
that
time
he
was
ready
to
shoot
himself
gossip
had
it
that
he
had
tried
and
failed
well
he
lived
it
down
and
my
mother
paid
full
penalty
for
her
misdeed
those
were
five
terrible
years
for
me
as
you
can
fancy
i
sympathized
with
my
father
but
i
took
my
part
for
i
did
know
the
true
circumstances
through
her
i
learned
to
distrust
and
hate
men
and
i
swore
to
her
never
to
be
a
man
slave
jean
but
you
became
engaged
to
the
lieutenant
governor
julie
just
to
make
him
my
slave
jean
but
that
he
did
care
to
be
julie
he
wanted
to
be
fast
enough
but
i
grew
tired
of
him
jean
yes
i
noticed
that
in
the
julie
what
do
you
mean
jean
i
saw
how
he
broke
the
engagement
julie
that
a
lie
it
was
i
who
broke
it
did
he
say
he
broke
it
the
wretch
jean
i
do
believe
that
he
was
a
wretch
you
hate
men
miss
julie
julie
most
of
them
sometimes
one
is
weak
jean
you
hate
me
julie
excessively
i
could
see
you
shot
jean
like
a
mad
dog
julie
exactly
jean
but
there
is
nothing
here
to
shoot
with
what
shall
we
do
then
julie
rousing
herself
must
get
away
from
here
travel
jean
and
torture
each
other
to
death
julie
no
to
enjoy
a
few
days
a
week
as
long
as
we
can
and
then
to
die
jean
die
how
silly
i
think
it
better
to
start
the
hotel
julie
not
heeding
him
by
the
lake
of
como
where
the
sun
is
always
shining
where
the
laurel
is
green
at
christmas
and
the
oranges
glow
jean
the
lake
of
como
is
a
rain
hole
i
never
saw
any
oranges
there
except
on
fruit
stands
but
it
a
good
resort
and
there
are
many
villas
to
rent
to
loving
couples
that
a
very
paying
industry
you
know
why
they
take
leases
for
half
a
year
at
least
but
they
usually
leave
in
three
weeks
julie
naively
why
after
three
weeks
jean
why
they
quarrel
of
course
but
the
rent
must
be
paid
all
the
same
then
you
and
so
one
after
another
they
come
and
go
for
there
is
plenty
of
love
although
it
does
last
long
julie
then
you
do
want
to
die
with
me
jean
i
do
want
to
die
at
all
both
because
i
enjoy
living
and
because
i
regard
suicide
as
a
crime
to
him
who
has
given
us
life
julie
then
you
believe
in
god
jean
yes
of
course
i
do
and
i
go
to
church
every
other
sunday
but
i
tired
of
all
this
and
i
going
to
bed
julie
do
you
think
i
would
allow
myself
to
be
satisfied
with
such
an
ending
do
you
know
what
a
man
owes
to
a
woman
he
hits
jean
takes
out
a
silver
coin
and
throws
it
on
the
table
allow
me
i
do
want
to
owe
anything
to
anyone
julie
pretending
not
to
notice
the
insult
do
you
know
what
the
law
demands
jean
i
know
that
the
law
demands
nothing
of
a
woman
who
seduces
a
man
julie
again
not
heeding
him
do
you
see
any
way
out
of
it
but
to
travel
wed
and
separate
jean
and
if
i
protest
against
this
misalliance
julie
misalliance
jean
yes
for
me
for
you
see
i
have
a
finer
ancestry
than
you
for
i
have
no
in
my
family
julie
how
do
you
know
jean
you
ca
prove
the
contrary
we
have
no
family
record
except
that
which
the
police
keep
but
your
pedigree
i
have
read
in
a
book
on
the
drawing
room
table
do
you
know
who
the
founder
of
your
family
was
it
was
a
miller
whose
wife
found
favor
with
the
king
during
the
danish
war
such
ancestry
i
have
not
julie
this
is
my
reward
for
opening
my
heart
to
anyone
so
unworthy
with
whom
i
have
talked
about
my
family
honor
jean
dishonor
yes
i
said
it
i
told
you
not
to
drink
because
then
one
talks
too
freely
and
one
should
never
talk
julie
oh
how
i
repent
all
this
if
at
least
you
loved
me
jean
for
the
last
time
what
do
you
mean
shall
i
weep
shall
i
jump
over
your
riding
whip
shall
i
kiss
you
lure
you
to
lake
como
for
three
weeks
and
then
what
do
you
want
anyway
this
is
getting
tiresome
but
that
the
way
it
always
is
when
you
get
mixed
up
in
women
affairs
miss
julie
i
see
that
you
are
unhappy
i
know
that
you
suffer
but
i
ca
understand
you
among
my
kind
there
is
no
nonsense
of
this
sort
we
love
as
we
play
when
work
gives
us
time
we
have
the
whole
day
and
night
for
it
like
you
julie
you
must
be
good
to
me
and
speak
to
me
as
though
i
were
a
human
being
jean
be
one
yourself
you
spit
on
me
and
expect
me
to
stand
it
julie
help
me
help
me
only
tell
me
what
to
do
show
me
a
way
out
of
this
jean
in
heaven
name
if
i
only
knew
myself
julie
i
have
been
raving
i
have
been
mad
but
is
there
no
means
of
deliverance
jean
stay
here
at
home
and
say
nothing
no
one
knows
julie
impossible
these
people
know
it
and
kristin
jean
they
do
know
it
and
could
never
suspect
such
a
thing
julie
hesitating
but
it
might
happen
again
jean
that
is
true
julie
and
the
consequences
jean
frightened
consequences
where
were
my
wits
not
to
have
thought
of
that
there
is
only
one
thing
to
do
get
away
from
here
immediately
i
ca
go
with
you
or
they
will
suspect
you
must
go
alone
away
from
here
anywhere
julie
alone
where
i
can
not
jean
you
must
and
before
the
count
returns
if
you
stay
we
know
how
it
will
be
if
one
has
taken
a
false
step
it
likely
to
happen
again
as
the
harm
has
already
been
done
and
one
grows
more
and
more
daring
until
at
last
all
is
discovered
write
the
count
afterward
and
confess
all
except
that
it
was
i
that
he
could
never
guess
and
i
do
think
he
be
so
anxious
to
know
who
it
was
anyway
julie
i
will
go
if
you
go
with
me
jean
are
you
raving
again
miss
julie
running
away
with
her
coachman
all
the
papers
would
be
full
of
it
and
that
the
count
could
never
live
through
julie
i
ca
go
i
ca
stay
help
me
i
so
tired
so
weary
command
me
set
me
in
motion
i
ca
think
any
more
ca

creatures
you
aristocrats

you
bristle
up
and
stick
up
your
noses
as
though
you
were
the
lords
of
creation
very
well
i
will
command
you
go
up
and
dress
yourself
and
see
to
it
that
you
have
travelling
money
and
then
come
down
she
hesitates

immediately
she
still
hesitates
he
takes
her
hand
and
leads
her
to
door
julie
speak
gently
to
me
jean
jean
a
command
always
sounds
harsh
feel

julie
jean
draws
a
sigh
of
relief
seats
himself
by
the
table
takes
out
a
notebook
and
pencil
and
counts
aloud

then
until
kristin

eyes
out
so
that
is
what
has
happened
how
i
ca
understand
no
that
was
very
nice
jean
are
you
mad
at
her
kristin
no
but
with
you
that
was
bad
of
you
very
bad
poor
girl
do
you
know
what
i
do
want
to
be
here
in
this
house
any
longer
where
one
can
not
respect
one
betters
jean
why
should
one
respect
them
kristin
yes
you
can
say
that
you
are
so
smart
but
i
do
want
to
serve
people
who
behave
so
it
reflects
on
oneself
i
think
jean
yes
but
it
a
comfort
that
they
not
a
bit
better
than
we
kristin
no
i
do
think
so
for
if
they
are
not
better
there
no
use
in
our
trying
to
better
ourselves
in
this
world
and
to
think
of
the
count
think
of
him
who
has
had
so
much
sorrow
all
his
days
no
i
want
to
stay
in
this
house
any
longer
and
to
think
of
it
being
with
such
as
you
if
it
had
been
the
lieutenant
jean
what
that
kristin
yes
he
was
good
enough
to
be
sure
but
there
a
difference
between
people
just
the
same
no
this
i
can
never
forget
miss
julie
who
was
always
so
proud
and
indifferent
to
men
one
never
would
believe
that
she
would
give
herself
and
to
one
like
you
she
who
was
ready
to
have
diana
shot
because
she
would
run
after
the
gatekeeper
mongrels
yes
i
say
it
and
here
i
wo
stay
any
longer
and
on
the
of
october
i
go
my
way
jean
and
then
kristin
well
as
we
come
to
talk
about
it
it
high
time
you
looked
around
for
something
else
since
we
going
to
get
married
jean
well
what
i
look
for
a
married
man
could
get
a
place
like
this
kristin
no
of
course
not
but
you
could
take
a
gatekeeper
job
or
look
for
a
watchman
place
in
some
factory
the
government
plums
are
few
but
they
are
sure
and
then
the
wife
and
children
get
a
pension
jean
with
a
grimace
that
all
very
fine
all
that
but
it
not
exactly
in
my
line
to
think
about
dying
for
my
wife
and
children
just
now
i
must
confess
that
i
have
slightly
different
aspirations
kristin
aspirations
aspirations
anyway
you
have
obligations
think
of
those
you
jean
do
irritate
me
with
talk
about
my
obligations
i
know
my
own
business
he
listens
we
have
plenty
of
time
for
all
this
some
other
day
go
and
get
ready
and
we
be
off
to
church
kristin
listening
who
that
walking
upstairs
jean
i
do
know
unless
it
clara
kristin
starting
to
go
it
could
never
be
the
count
who
has
come
home
without
anyone
hearing
him
jean
frightened
the
count
i
ca
believe
that
he
would
have
rung
the
bell
kristin
god
help
us
never
have
i
been
mixed
up
in
anything
like
this
exit
kristin
the
sun
has
risen
and
lights
up
the
scene
presently
the
sunshine
comes
in
through
windows
at
an
angle
jean
goes
to
door
and
motions
enter
julie
dressed
for
travelling
carrying
a
small
bird
cage
covered
with
a
cloth
which
she
places
on
a
chair
julie

am
ready
jean
hush
kristin

stirring
julie
frightened
and
nervous

of
the
stuffy

packed
in
with
the
crowds
of
people

at
one
the
long
stops
at
the
stations
when
one
would
be
speeding
away

and
then
the
memories
childhood
memories
of
midsummer
day
the
church
decorated
with
birch
branches
and
syringa
blossoms
the
festive
dinner
table
with
relations
and
friends
afternoon
in
the
park
music
dancing
flowers
and
games
oh
one
may
fly
fly
but
anguish
and
remorse
follow
in
the
pack
wagon
jean
i
go
with
you
if

too
late
julie

stake
so
quickly
snatches
bird
from
her
and
goes
to
chopping
block
and
takes
up
meat
chopper

should
have
learned
how
to
chop
off
a
chicken
head
instead
of
shooting
with
a
revolver
he
chops
off
the
bird
head
then
you
would
swoon
at
a
drop
of
blood
julie

can
butcher
an
innocent
bird
without

blood
flowing
to
see
your
brain
on
the
chopping
block
all
your
sex

sea
of

of
your
skull

my
feet
in
your
breast
and
eat
your
heart
cooked
whole
you
think
i
am

believe
that
i
love
you
because
my
life

would
carry
your
offspring
under
my
heart

my
blood
give
birth
to
your
child
and

scuffle
with
his
servant
then

the
end

a
shock
and

swords
across
the
coffin
and
the
count

is
extinct
the
serf
line
will
continue
in
an
orphanage

the
gutter
and

the
king

talking
splendid
miss

only
keep
the
miller
in
his
sack
enter
kristin
with
in

julie
hastening
to

and
falls
in
her
arms
as
though
seeking
protection
help
me
kristin
help
me
against
this
man
kristin
cold
and
unmoved
what
kind
of
performance
is

a
holy
day

this
mean
this
noise
and
fuss
julie
kristin
you

a
woman
and
my
friend
beware

this
wretch
jean
a
little
embarrassed
and
surprised
while

go
and
shave

julie
you
must
understand
me
you
must
listen
to
me
kristin
no
i
ca

all
this
bosh
where

you
be
going
in
your
traveling
dress

his
hat
on
hey

to
me
kristin

to
me
and
i
tell
you
everything
kristin
i
do

julie
you
must
listen
to
me
kristin
what
about
is
it
that
foolishness
with
jean
that
concern
me
at
all
that
i
wo
be
mixed
up
with
but
if
you
trying
to
lure
him
to
run
away
with
you
then
we
must
put
a
stop
to
it
julie
nervously
try
to
be
calm
now
kristin
and
listen
to
me
i
stay
here
and
jean
ca
stay
here
that
being
true
we
must
leave
kristin
kristin
hm
hm
julie
brightening
up
but
i
have
an
idea
what
if
we
three
should
go
away
to
foreign
parts
to
switzerland
and
set
up
a
hotel
together
i
have
money
you
see
and
jean
and
i
would
back
the
whole
thing
you
could
run
the
kitchen
wo
that
be
fine
say
yes
now
and
come
with
us
there
everything
would
be
arranged
say
yes
throws
her
arms
around
kristin
and
coaxes
her
kristin
cold
and
reflecting
hm
hm
julie
presto
tempo
you
have
never
been
out
and
traveled
kristin
you
shall
look
about
you
in
the
world
you
ca
believe
how
pleasant
traveling
on
a
train
is
new
faces
continually
new
countries
and
we
go
to
hamburg
and
passing
through
we
see
the
zoological
gardens
that
you
will
like
then
we
go
to
the
theatre
and
hear
the
opera
and
when
we
reach
munich
there
will
be
the
museum
there
are
rubins
and
raphaels
and
all
the
big
painters
that
you
know
you
have
heard
of
munich
where
king
ludwig
lived
the
king
you
know
who
went
mad
then
we
see
his
palace
a
palace
like
those
in
the
sagas
and
from
there
it
is
far
to
switzerland
and
the
alps
the
alps
mind
you
with
snow
in
and
there
oranges
grow
and
laurel
green
all
the
year
round
if
jean
is
seen
in
the
doorway
stropping
his
razor
on
the
strop
which
he
holds
between
his
teeth
and
left
hand
he
listens
and
nods
his
head
favorably
now
and
then
julie
continues
tempo
prestissimo
and
there
we
take
a
hotel
and
i
sit
taking
the
cash
while
jean
greets
the
guests
goes
out
and
markets
writes
letters
that
will
be
life
you
may
believe
then
the
train
whistles
then
the
omnibus
comes
then
a
bell
rings
upstairs
then
in
the
restaurant
and
then
i
make
out
the
bills
and
i
can
salt
them
you
ca
think
how
people
tremble
when
they
receive
their
bill
and
you
you
can
sit
like
a
lady
of
course
you
wo
have
to
stand
over
the
stove
you
can
dress
finely
and
neatly
when
you
show
yourself
to
the
people
and
you
with
your
appearance
oh
i
not
flattering
you
can
catch
a
husband
some
fine
day
a
rich
englishman
perhaps
they
are
so
easy
to
slowing
up
to
catch
then
we
be
rich
and
then
we
build
a
villa
by
lake
como
to
be
sure
it
rains
sometimes
but
becoming
languid
the
sun
must
shine
too
sometimes
although
it
seems
dark
and
if
not
we
can
at
least
travel
homeward
and
come
back
here
or
some
other
place
kristin
listen
now
does
miss
julie
believe
in
all
this
julie
going
to
pieces
julie
do
i
believe
in
it
kristin
yes
julie
tired
i
do
know
i
do
believe
in
anything
any
more
sinks
down
on
bench
and
takes
head
in
her
hand
on
table
in
nothing
nothing
kristin
turns
to
and
looks
toward
jean
so
you
intended
to
run
away
jean
rather
shamefaced
comes
forward
and
puts
razor
on
table
run
away
that
putting
it
rather
strong
you
heard
miss
julie
project
i
think
it
might
be
carried
out
kristin
now
listen
to
that
was
it
meant
that
i
should
be
her
cook
jean
sharply
be
so
good
as
to
use
proper
language
when
you
speak
of
your
mistress
kristin
mistress
jean
yes
kristin
no
hear
listen
to
him
jean
yes
you
listen
you
need
to
and
talk
less
miss
julie
is
your
mistress
and
for
the
same
reason
that
you
do
not
respect
her
now
you
should
not
respect
yourself
kristin
i
have
always
had
so
much
respect
for
myself
jean
that
you
never
had
any
left
for
others
kristin
i
have
never
lowered
my
position
let
any
one
say
if
they
can
that
the
count
cook
has
had
anything
to
do
with
the
riding
master
or
the
swineherd
let
them
come
and
say
it
jean
yes
you
happened
to
get
a
fine
fellow
that
was
your
good
luck
kristin
yes
a
fine
fellow
who
sells
the
count
oats
from
his
stable
jean
is
it
for
you
to
say
anything
you
who
get
a
commission
on
all
the
groceries
and
a
bribe
from
the
butcher
kristin
what
that
jean
and
you
ca
have
respect
for
your
master
and
mistress
any
longer
you
you
kristin
glad
to
change
the
subject
are
you
coming
to
church
with
me
you
need
a
good
sermon
for
your
actions
jean
no
i
not
going
to
church
today
you
can
go
alone
and
confess
your
doings
kristin
yes
that
i
shall
do
and
i
shall
return
with
so
much
forgiveness
that
there
will
be
enough
for
you
too
the
savior
suffered
and
died
on
the
cross
for
all
our
sins
and
when
we
go
to
him
in
faith
and
a
repentant
spirit
he
takes
our
sins
on
himself
julie
do
you
believe
that
kristin
kristin
that
is
my
life
belief
as
true
as
i
stand
here
and
that
was
my
childhood
belief
that
i
have
kept
since
my
youth
miss
julie
and
where
sin
overflows
there
mercy
overflows
also
julie
oh
if
i
only
had
your
faith
oh
if
kristin
yes
but
you
see
that
is
not
given
without
god
particular
grace
and
that
is
not
allotted
to
all
that
julie
who
are
the
chosen
kristin
that
is
the
great
secret
of
the
kingdom
of
grace
and
the
lord
has
no
respect
for
persons
but
there
the
last
shall
be
first
julie
but
then
has
he
respect
for
the
last
the
lowliest
person
kristin
continuing
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
pass
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
the
way
it
is
miss
julie
however
now
i
am
going
alone
and
on
my
way
i
shall
stop
in
and
tell
the
stable
boy
not
to
let
any
horses
go
out
in
case
any
one
wants
to
get
away
before
the
count
comes
home
good
bye
exit
kristin
jean
such
a
devil
and
all
this
on
account
of
your
confounded
canary
julie
tired
oh
do
speak
of
the
canary
do
you
see
any
way
out
any
end
to
this
jean
thinking
no
julie
what
would
you
do
in
my
place
jean
in
your
place
wait
as
a
noble
lady
as
a
woman
fallen
i
know
yes
now
i
know
julie
she
takes
up
razor
from
table
and
makes
gestures
saying
this
jean
yes
but
should
not
do
it
mark
you
for
there
is
a
difference
between
us
julie
because
you
are
a
man
and
i
am
a
woman
what
other
difference
is
there
jean
that
very
difference
of
man
and
woman
julie
razor
in
hand
i
want
to
do
it
but
i
ca
my
father
either
that
time
when
he
should
have
done
it
jean
no
he
was
right
not
to
do
it
he
had
to
avenge
himself
first
julie
and
now
my
mother
revenges
herself
again
through
me
jean
have
you
loved
your
father
miss
julie
julie
yes
deeply
but
i
have
probably
hated
him
too
i
must
have
without
being
aware
of
it
and
it
is
due
to
my
father
training
that
i
have
learned
to
scorn
my
own
sex
between
them
both
they
have
made
me
half
man
half
woman
whose
is
the
fault
for
what
has
happened
my
father
my
mother
my
own
i
have
anything
of
my
own
i
have
a
thought
which
was
not
my
father
not
a
passion
that
was
my
mother
and
last
of
all
from
my
betrothed
the
idea
that
all
people
are
equal
for
that
i
now
call
him
a
wretch
how
can
it
be
my
own
fault
then
throw
the
burden
on
jesus
as
kristin
did
no
i
am
too
proud
too
intelligent
thanks
to
my
father
and
that
a
rich
man
can
not
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
that
is
a
lie
and
kristin
who
has
money
in
the
savings
bank
she
surely
can
not
enter
there
whose
is
the
fault
what
does
it
concern
us
whose
fault
it
is
it
is
i
who
must
bear
the
burden
and
the
consequences

two
sharp

wind
sang
in

oak
wood
when

hemlocks
gave
forth

finches
twittered
among

linden
trees

the
god
of
spring

joy
lulled
you
to

went
to
the
wars
against
the
saracens
to
seek
you
the
other
side
of
the
grave
but
my
time
had
not
yet
come
when
the
fourth
spring
came
i
heard
through
wandering
merchants
that
you
were
to
be
found
here
now
i
have
found
you
and
you
wish
me
to
leave
you
in
this
heathen
darkness
gunl√∂d
i
am
not
alone
gunnar
your
father
does
not
love
you
your
mother
does
not
understand
you
and
they
are
both
heathen
gunl√∂d
i

friends
among
the
christians

a
christian
gunl√∂d

i
give
you
a
brother
christian
kiss
the
first
gunl√∂d
you
have
from
me
gunl√∂d
you
must
never
kiss
me
again
gunnar
but
tell
me
how
did
you
become
a
christian
gunl√∂d
first
i
believed
in
my
father
he
was
so
strong
then
i
believed
in
my
mother
she
was
so
good
last
i
believed
in
you
you
were
so
strong
and
good
and
so
beautiful
and
when
you
went
away
i
stood
alone
myself
i
could
never
believe
in
i
was
so
weak
then
i
thought
of
your
god
whom
you
so
often
begged
me
to
love
and
i
prayed
to
him
gunnar
and
the
old
gods
gunl√∂d
i
have
never
been
able
to
believe
in
them
although
my
father
commanded
me
to
do
so
they
are
wicked
gunnar
who
has
taught
you
to
pray
who
gave
you
the
crucifix
gunl√∂d
the
bishop
gunnar
and
that
no
one
knows
gunl√∂d
no
i
have
had
to
lie
to
my
mother
and
that
troubles
me
gunnar
and
your
father
hid
you
here
so
that
the
christians
should
not
get
you
gunl√∂d
yes
and
now
he
is
expected
home
from
norway
with
followers
as
he
is
to
be
erl
of
the
island
gunnar
god
forbid
gunl√∂d

must
not
delay

first
cock
crow
we
shall
be
beyond
pursuit
gunl√∂d
yes
yes
gunnar
soon
we
should
be
at
osterg√∂tland
where
the
summer
is
still
green
and
there
you
shall
live
in
my
castle
which
i
have
built
where
your
father
house
stood
gunl√∂d
does
not
that
still
stand
gunnar
no
it
was
burned
gunl√∂d
by
the
christians
gunnar
you
are
so
passionate
gunl√∂d
gunl√∂d
i
suffer
to
say
i
would
rather
be
a
heathen
gunnar
what
are
you
saying
girl
gunl√∂d
after
a
pause
forgive
me
forgive
me
i
am
in
such
a
wild
mood
and
when
i
see
the
christians
who
should
be
examples
commit
such
deeds
gunnar
crush
out
that
thought
gunl√∂d
it
is
ungodly
do
you
see
this
wreath
gunl√∂d
where
did
you
gather
it
gunnar
you
recognize
the
flowers
gunl√∂d
gunl√∂d
they
grew
in
my
father
garden
may
i
keep
them
gunnar
gladly
but
why
do
you
care
to
have
them
when
we
are
going
to
journey
there
ourselves
gunl√∂d
i
shall
look
at
them
the
long
winter
through
the
hemlock
shall
remind
me
of
the
green
woods
and
the
anemones
of
the
blue
sky
gunnar
and
when
they
are
withered
gunl√∂d
of
that
i
do
not
think
gunnar
then
go
with
me
from
this
drear
land
far
away
and
there
where
our
childhood
was
spent
we
will
live
as
free
as

the
temple
of

when
the
bells

you
of

roof
and
high
pillared
aisles
and
hear
the
acolytes
singing
when

bishop
lights
the
incense
on

solemnize
the

the
sake
of
your
belief

remember
there
was
a
maiden
she
had
a
friend
who
went
away
after
she
was
never
again
glad
she
only
sat
sewing
silk
and
gold
what
she
was
making
no
one
knew
and
when
they
asked
her
she
would
only
weep
and
when
they
asked
her
why
she
wept
she
never
answered
only
wept
she
grew
pale
of
cheek
and
her
mother
made
ready
her
then
there
came
an
old
woman
and
she
said
it
was
love
gunnar
i
never
wept
when
you
went
away
as
father
says
it
is
weak
to
shed
tears
i
never
sewed
silk
and
gold
for
that
my
mother
has
never
taught
me
to
do
then
had
i
not

often
thought
of

dreamed
so
often
of
you

this
morning
when
i
stood
by
the
window
where

willingly
and
gazing
over
the
sea
i
saw
your
ship
come
up
out
of
the
east
i
became
unquiet
although
i
did
not
know
it
was
your
ship
gunnar
why
do
you
gaze
so
willingly
over
the
sea
gunl√∂d

ask
many
questions
gunnar

did
you
want
to
close
the
door
against

her
in
his
arms
and

her
gunl√∂d

herself
away

is
never
to
do
anything

other
never
to

thorfinn

if

one
regrets
orm
thorfinn
that
is
to
say
you
regret
your
harshness
toward
your
child
thorfinn
angry
i
regret
nothing
and
as
far
as
the
child
is

you
had
better
hold
your
tongue
orm
hear
you
thorfinn
have
you
ever
thought
about
what
your

intend
to
do
now

is
silent
orm
you
see
how
even
a
little
thought
struck
you
think
then
if
a
big
thought
should
come
why
do
you
dare
to
look
back
because
you
are
afraid
of
the
sights
you
would
see
thorfinn
let
the
past
remain
buried
orm
no
i
shall
tear
the
corpses
from
their
graves
and
they
shall
stare
at
you
with
their
empty
orbits

you
quake
with
anguish
and
fear
and
you
shall
see
that
with
all
your
strength
you
were
not
a
man

what
are
you
saying

orm
goes
out
thorfinn
alone
alone
alone
pause
i
remember
one
autumn
when
the
equinoctial
storm
raged
over
england
sun
my
dragon
ship
was
wrecked
and
i
was
tossed
up
on
the
rocks
alone
afterward
everything
grew
calm
oh
what
long
days
and
nights
only
the
cloudless
sky
above
and
endlessly
the
deep
blue
sea
around
me
not
a
sound
of
any
living
creature
not
even
the
gulls
to
wake
me
with
their
screeching
not
even
a
breeze
stirred
the
waves
to
lap
against
the
stones
it
seemed
as
if
i
myself
were
dead
loudly
i
talked
and
shouted
but
the
sound
of
my
voice
frightened
me
and
thirst
bound
my
tongue
only
the
even
beat
of
my
heart
in
my
breast
told
me
that
i
was
alive
but
after
a
listening
i
heard
it
no
longer
and
trembling
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
so
it
was
each
time
until
senseless
i
swooned
when
at
last
i
revived
i
heard
the
slow
beats
of
a
heart
beside
me
and
a
deep
breathing
that
was
not
mine
and
courage
revived
in
my
soul
i
looked
about
it
was
a
seal
seeking
rest
it
gazed
at
me
with
its
moist
eyes
as
if
filled
with
compassion
for
me
now
i
was
no
longer
alone
i
stretched
out
my
hand
to
caress
its
rough
body
then
it
fled
and
i
was
doubly
alone
again
i
am
on
the
rocks
what
do
i
fear
yes
loneliness
what
is
loneliness
it
is
i
myself
who
am
i
then
to
fear
myself
am
i
not
erl
thorfinn
the
strong
who
has
bowed
thousands
of
wills
to
his
who
never
asked
for
friendship
or
love
but
himself
bore
his
own
sorrows
no
no
i
am
another
and
therefore
thorfinn
the
strong
fears
thorfinn
the
weak
who
stole
my
strength
who
struck
me
down
was
it
the
sea
have
i
not
vanquished
the
sea
three
times
ten
voyages
and
it
has
defeated
me
but
once
but
then
to
the
death
it
was
the
stronger
it
was
a
god
but
who
subdued
the
sea
that
lately
raged
who
who
who
it
was
the
stronger
who
are
you
then
the
stronger
oh
answer
that
i
may
believe
he
does
not
answer
all
is
silent

north

when
you
became
christians
here
on
the
island

a
bridal
party
in

the

sat
reading
a

to

and
she
read
a

a

do
you
remember

be

that
christmas
when

your
fiance
parents
in
the
country
how
you
gloried
in
the
happiness
of
home
life
and
really
longed
to
quit
the
theatre
forever
yes
amelie
dear
home
is
the
best
of
all
the

next
and
children
well
you
do

mlle
y
looks
up
scornfully
mme
sips
a
few
spoonfuls
out
of
the

then

and

christmas

mme

now

for

do
you

how
she
can

and
turn
her
head

and
here

maja
popgun

and
shoots

y
mlle
y
makes
a
startled
gesture
mme
x
did
i
frighten
you
do
you
think
i
would
like
to
shoot
you
eh
on
my
soul
if
i
do
think
you
did
if
you
wanted
to
shoot
it
would
be
so
surprising
because
i
stood
in
your
way
and
i
know
you
can
never
forget
that
although
i
was
absolutely
innocent
you
still
believe
i
intrigued
and
got
you
out
of
the
stora
theatre
but
i
did
i
did
do
that
although
you
think
so
well
it
does
make
any
difference
what
i
say
to
you
you
still
believe
i
did
it
takes
up
a
pair
of
embroidered
slippers
and
these
are
for
my
better
half
i
embroidered
them
myself
i
ca
bear
tulips
but
he
wants
tulips
on
everything
mlle
y
looks
up
ironically
and
curiously
mme
x
putting
a
hand
in
each
slipper
what
little
feet
bob
has
what
and
you
should
see
what
a
splendid
stride
he
has
you
never
seen
him
in
slippers
mlle
laughs
aloud
look
she
makes
the
slippers
walk
on
the
table
mlle
laughs
loudly
and
when
he
is
grumpy
he
stamps
like
this
with
his
foot
what
damn
those
servants
who
can
never
learn
to
make
coffee
oh
now
those
creatures
have
trimmed
the
lamp
wick
properly
and
then
there
are
draughts
on
the
floor
and
his
feet
are
cold
ugh
how
cold
it
is
the
stupid
idiots
can
never
keep
the
fire
going
she
rubs
the
slippers
together
one
sole
over
the
other
mlle
y
shrieks
with
laughter
mme
x
and
then
he
comes
home
and
has
to
hunt
for
his
slippers
which
marie
has
stuck
under
the
chiffonier
oh
but
it
sinful
to
sit
here
and
make
fun
of
one
husband
this
way
when
he
is
kind
and
a
good
little
man
you
ought
to
have
had
such
a
husband
amelie
what
are
you
laughing
at
what
what
and
you
see
he
true
to
me
yes
i
sure
of
that
because
he
told
me
himself
what
are
you
laughing
at
that
when
i
was
touring
in
norway
that
that
brazen
frƒôdƒôrique
came
and
wanted
to
seduce
him
can
you
fancy
anything
so
infamous
pause
i
have
torn
her
eyes
out
if
she
had
come
to
see
him
when
i
was
at
home
pause
it
was
lucky
that
bob
told
me
about
it
himself
and
that
it
did
reach
me
through
gossip
pause
but
would
you
believe
it
frƒôdƒôrique
was
the
only
one
i
do
know
why
but
the
women
are
crazy
about
my
husband
they
must
think
he
has
influence
about
getting
them
theatrical
engagements
because
he
is
connected
with
the
government
perhaps
you
were
after
him
yourself
i
did
use
to
trust
you
any
too
much
but
now
i
know
he
never
bothered
his
head
about
you
and
you
always
seemed
to
have
a
grudge
against
him
someway
pause
they
look
at
each
other
in
a
puzzled
way
mme
x
come
and
see
us
this
evening
amelie
and
show
us
that
not
put
out
with
us
not
put
out
with
me
at
any
rate
i
do
know
but
i
think
it
would
be
uncomfortable
to
have
you
for
an
enemy
perhaps
it
because
i
stood
in
your
way
rallentando
or
i
really
do
know
why
in
particular
pause
mlle
stares
at
mme
x
curiously
mme
x
thoughtfully
our
acquaintance
has
been
so
queer
when
i
saw
you
for
the
first
time
i
was
afraid
of
you
so
afraid
that
i
did
dare
let
you
out
of
my
sight
no
matter
when
or
where
i
always
found
myself
near
you
i
did
dare
have
you
for
an
enemy
so
i
became
your
friend
but
there
was
always
discord
when
you
came
to
our
house
because
i
saw
that
my
husband
could
endure
you
and
the
whole
thing
seemed
as
awry
to
me
as
an
gown
and
i
did
all
i
could
to
make
him
friendly
toward
you
but
with
no
success
until
you
became
engaged
then
came
a
violent
friendship
between
you
so
that
it
looked
all
at
once
as
though
you
both
dared
show
your
real
feelings
only
when
you
were
secure
and
then
how
was
it
later
i
did
get
jealous
strange
to
say
and
i
remember
at
the
christening
when
you
acted
as
godmother
i
made
him
kiss
you
he
did
so
and
you
became
so
confused
as
it
were
i
notice
it
then
did
think
about
it
later
either
have
never
thought
about
it
until
now
rises
suddenly
why
are
you
silent
you
said
a
word
this
whole
time
but
you
have
let
me
go
on
talking
you
have
sat
there
and
your
eyes
have
reeled
out
of
me
all
these
thoughts
which
lay
like
raw
silk
in
its
cocoon
thoughts
suspicious
thoughts
perhaps
let
me
see
why
did
you
break
your
engagement
why
do
you
never
come
to
our
house
any
more
why
wo
you
come
to
see
us
tonight
mlle
appears
as
if
about
to
speak
mme
hush
you
need
speak
i
understand
it
all
it
was
because
and
because
and
because
yes
yes
now
all
the
accounts
balance
that
it
fie
i
wo
sit
at
the
same
table
with
you
moves
her
things
to
another
table
that
the
reason
i
had
to
embroider
tulips
which
i
hate
on
his
slippers
because
you
are
fond
of
tulips
that
why
throws
slippers
on
the
floor
we
go
to
lake
m√§larn
in
the
summer
because
you
do
like
salt
water
that
why
my
boy
is
named
eskil
because
it
your
father
name
that
why
i
wear
your
colors
read
your
authors
eat
your
favorite
dishes
drink
your
drinks
chocolate
for
instance
that
why
oh
my
god
it
terrible
when
i
think
about
it
it
terrible
everything
everything
came
from
you
to
me
even
your
passions
your
soul
crept
into
mine
like
a
worm
into
an
apple
ate
and
ate
bored
and
bored
until
nothing
was
left
but
the
rind
and
a
little
black
dust
within
i
wanted
to
get
away
from
you
but
i
could
you
lay
like
a
snake
and
charmed
me
with
your
black
eyes
i
felt
that
when
i
lifted
my
wings
they
only
dragged
me
down
i
lay
in
the
water
with
bound
feet
and
the
stronger
i
strove
to
keep
up
the
deeper
i
worked
myself
down
down
until
i
sank
to
the
bottom
where
you
lay
like
a
giant
crab
to
clutch
me
in
your
claws
and
there
i
am
lying
now
i
hate
you
hate
you
hate
you
and
you
only
sit
there
silent
silent
and
indifferent
indifferent
whether
it
new
moon
or
waning
moon
christmas
or
new
year
whether
others
are
happy
or
unhappy
without
power
to
hate
or
to
love
as
quiet
as
a
stork
by
a
rat
hole
you
could
scent
your
prey
and
capture
it
but
you
could
lie
in
wait
for
it
you
sit
here
in
your
corner
of
the
cafƒô
did
you
know
it
called
the
rat
trap
for
you
and
read
the
papers
to
see
if
misfortune
befallen
some
one
to
see
if
some
one
has
been
given
notice
at
the
theatre
perhaps
you
sit
here
and
calculate
about
your
next
victim
and
reckon
on
your
chances
of
recompense
like
a
pilot
in
a
shipwreck
poor
amelie
i
pity
you
nevertheless
because
i
know
you
are
unhappy
unhappy
like
one
who
has
been
wounded
and
angry
because
you
are
wounded
i
ca
be
angry
with
you
no
matter
how
much
i
want
to
be
because
you
come
out
the
weaker
one
yes
all
that
with
bob
trouble
me
what
is
that
to
me
after
all
and
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
i
learned
to
drink
chocolate
from
you
or
some
one
else
sips
a
spoonful
from
her
cup
besides
chocolate
is
very
healthful
and
if
you
taught
me
how
to
dress
tant
mieux
that
has
only
made
me
more
attractive
to
my
husband
so
you
lost
and
i
won
there
well
judging
by
certain
signs
i
believe
you
have
already
lost
him
and
you
certainly
intended
that
i
should
leave
him
do
as
you
did
with
your
fiancƒô
and
regret
as
you
now
regret
but
you
see
i
do
do
that
we
must
be
too
exacting
and
why
should
i
take
only
what
no
one
else
wants
perhaps
take
it
all
in
all
i
am
at
this
moment
the
stronger
one
you
received
nothing
from
me
but
you
gave
me
much
and
now
i
seem
like
a
thief
since
you
have
awakened
and
find
i
possess
what
is
your
loss
how
could
it
be
otherwise
when
everything
is
worthless
and
sterile
in
your
hands
you
can
never
keep
a
man
love
with
your
tulips
and
your
passions
but
i
can
keep
it
you
ca
learn
how
to
live
from
your
authors
as
i
have
learned
you
have
no
little
eskil
to
cherish
even
if
your
father
name
was
eskil
and
why
are
you
always
silent
silent
silent
i
thought
that
was
strength
but
perhaps
it
is
because
you
have
nothing
to
say
because
you
never
think
about
anything
rises
and
picks
up
slippers
now
i
going
home
and
take
the
tulips
with
me
tulips
you
are
unable
to
learn
from
another
you
ca
bend
therefore
you
broke
like
a
dry
stalk
but
i
wo
break
thank
you
amelie
for
all
your
good
lessons
thanks
for
teaching
my
husband
how
to
love
now
i
going
home
to
love
him
goes
