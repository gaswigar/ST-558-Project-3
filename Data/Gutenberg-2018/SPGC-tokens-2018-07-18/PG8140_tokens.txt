an
honest
god
is
the
noblest
work
of
man
each
nation
has
created
a
god
and
the
god
has
always
resembled
his
creators
he
hated
and
loved
what
they
hated
and
loved
and
he
was
invariably
found
on
the
side
of
those
in
power
each
god
was
intensely
patriotic
and
detested
all
nations
but
his
own
all
these
gods
demanded
praise
flattery
and
worship
most
of
them
were
pleased
with
sacrifice
and
the
smell
of
innocent
blood
has
ever
been
considered
a
divine
perfume
all
these
gods
have
insisted
upon
having
a
vast
number
of
priests
and
the
priests
have
always
insisted
upon
being
supported
by
the
people
and
the
principal
business
of
these
priests
has
been
to
boast
about
their
god
and
to
insist
that
he
could
easily
vanquish
all
the
other
gods
put
together
these
gods
have
been
manufactured
after
numberless
models
and
according
to
the
most
grotesque
fashions
some
have
a
thousand
arms
some
a
hundred
heads
some
are
adorned
with
necklaces
of
living
snakes
some
are
armed
with
clubs
some
with
sword
and
shield
some
with
bucklers
and
some
with
wings
as
a
cherub
some
were
invisible
some
would
show
themselves
entire
and
some
would
only
show
their
backs
some
were
jealous
some
were
foolish
some
turned
themselves
into
men
some
into
swans
some
into
bulls
some
into
doves
and
some
into
holy
ghosts
and
made
love
to
the
beautiful
daughters
of
men
some
were
married
all
ought
to
have
been
and
some
were
considered
as
old
bachelors
from
all
eternity
some
had
children
and
the
children
were
turned
into
gods
and
worshiped
as
their
fathers
had
been
most
of
these
gods
were
revengeful
savage
lustful
and
ignorant
as
they
generally
depended
upon
their
priests
for
information
their
ignorance
can
hardly
excite
our
astonishment
these
gods
did
not
even
know
the
shape
of
the
worlds
they
had
created
but
supposed
them
perfectly
flat
some
thought
the
day
could
be
lengthened
by
stopping
the
sun
that
the
blowing
of
horns
could
throw
down
the
walls
of
a
city
and
all
knew
so
little
of
the
real
nature
of
the
people
they
had
created
that
they
commanded
the
people
to
love
them
some
were
so
ignorant
as
to
suppose
that
man
could
believe
just
as
he
might
desire
or
as
might
command
and
to
be
governed
by
observation
reason
and
experience
was
a
most
foul
and
damning
sin
none
of
these
gods
could
give
a
true
account
of
the
creation
of
this
little
earth
all
were
woefully
deficient
in
geology
and
astronomy
as
a
rule
they
were
most
miserable
legislators
and
as
executives
they
were
far
inferior
to
the
average
of
american
presidents
the
deities
have
demanded
the
most
abject
and
degrading
obedience
in
order
to
please
them
man
must
lay
his
very
face
in
the
dust
of
course
they
have
always
been
partial
to
the
people
who
created
them
and
they
have
generally
shown
their
partiality
by
assisting
those
people
to
rob
and
destroy
others
and
to
ravish
their
wives
and
daughters
nothing
is
so
pleasing
to
these
gods
as
the
butchery
of
unbelievers
nothing
so
enrages
them
even
now
as
to
have
some
one
deny
their
existence
few
nations
have
been
so
poor
as
to
have
but
one
god
gods
were
made
so
easily
and
the
raw
material
cost
so
little
that
generally
the
god
market
was
fairly
glutted
and
heaven
crammed
with
these
phantoms
these
gods
not
only
attended
to
the
skies
but
were
supposed
to
interfere
in
all
the
affairs
of
men
they
presided
over
everybody
and
everything
they
attended
to
every
department
all
was
supposed
to
be
under
their
immediate
control
nothing
was
too
small
nothing
too
large
the
falling
of
sparrows
and
the
motions
of
planets
were
alike
attended
to
by
these
industrious
and
observing
deities
from
their
starry
thrones
they
frequently
came
to
the
earth
for
the
purpose
of
imparting
information
to
man
it
is
related
of
one
that
he
came
amid
thunderings
and
lightnings
in
order
to
tell
the
people
they
should
not
cook
a
kid
in
its
mother
milk
some
left
their
shining
abode
to
tell
women
that
they
should
or
should
not
have
children
to
inform
a
priest
how
to
cut
and
wear
his
apron
and
to
give
directions
as
to
the
proper
manner
for
cleaning
the
intestines
of
a
bird
when
the
people
failed
to
worship
one
of
these
gods
or
failed
to
feed
and
clothe
his
priests
which
was
much
the
same
thing
he
generally
visited
them
with
pestilence
and
famine
sometimes
he
allowed
some
other
nation
to
drag
them
into
slavery
to
sell
their
wives
and
children
but
generally
he
glutted
his
vengeance
by
murdering
their
first
born
the
priests
always
did
their
whole
duty
not
only
in
predicting
these
calamities
but
in
proving
when
they
did
happen
that
they
were
brought
upon
the
people
because
they
had
not
given
quite
enough
to
them
these
gods
differed
just
as
the
nations
differed
the
greatest
and
most
powerful
had
the
most
powerful
gods
while
the
weaker
ones
were
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
the
very
of
the
heavens
each
of
these
gods
promised
happiness
here
and
hereafter
to
all
his
slaves
and
threatened
to
eternally
punish
all
who
either
disbelieved
in
his
existence
or
suspected
that
some
other
god
might
be
his
superior
but
to
deny
the
existence
of
all
gods
was
and
is
the
crime
of
crimes
redden
your
hands
with
human
blood
blast
by
slander
the
fair
fame
of
the
innocent
strangle
the
smiling
child
upon
its
mother
knees
deceive
ruin
and
desert
the
beautiful
girl
who
loves
and
trusts
you
and
your
case
is
not
hopeless
for
all
this
and
for
all
these
you
may
be
forgiven
for
all
this
and
for
all
these
that
bankrupt
court
established
by
the
gospel
will
give
you
a
discharge
but
deny
the
existence
of
these
divine
ghosts
of
these
gods
and
the
sweet
and
tearful
face
of
mercy
becomes
livid
with
eternal
hate
heaven
golden
gates
are
shut
and
you
with
an
infinite
curse
ringing
in
your
ears
with
the
brand
of
infamy
upon
your
brow
commence
your
endless
wanderings
in
the
lurid
gloom
of
hell
an
immortal
vagrant
an
eternal
outcast
a
deathless
convict
one
of
these
gods
and
one
who
demands
our
love
our
admiration
and
our
worship
and
one
who
is
worshiped
if
mere
heartless
ceremony
is
worship
gave
to
his
chosen
people
for
their
guidance
the
following
laws
of
war
when
thou
comest
nigh
unto
a
city
to
fight
against
it
then
proclaim
peace
unto
it
and
it
shall
be
if
it
make
thee
answer
of
peace
and
open
unto
thee
then
it
shall
be
that
all
the
people
that
is
found
therein
shall
be
tributaries
unto
thee
and
they
shall
serve
thee
and
if
it
will
make
no
peace
with
thee
but
will
make
war
against
thee
then
thou
shalt
besiege
it
and
when
the
lord
thy
god
hath
delivered
it
into
thine
hands
thou
shalt
smite
every
male
thereof
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
but
the
women
and
the
little
ones
and
the
cattle
and
all
that
is
in
the
city
even
all
the
spoil
thereof
shalt
thou
take
unto
thyself
and
thou
shalt
eat
the
spoil
of
thine
enemies
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
given
thee
thus
shalt
thou
do
unto
all
the
cities
which
are
very
far
off
from
thee
which
are
not
of
the
cities
of
these
nations
but
of
the
cities
of
these
people
which
the
lord
thy
god
doth
give
thee
for
an
inheritance
thou
shall
save
alive
nothing
that
breatheth
is
it
possible
for
man
to
conceive
of
anything
more
perfectly
infamous
can
you
believe
that
such
directions
were
given
by
any
except
an
infinite
fiend
remember
that
the
army
receiving
these
instructions
was
one
of
invasion
peace
was
offered
on
condition
that
the
people
submitting
should
be
the
slaves
of
the
invader
but
if
any
should
have
the
courage
to
defend
their
home
to
fight
for
the
love
of
wife
and
child
then
the
sword
was
to
spare
none
not
even
the
prattling
dimpled
babe
and
we
are
called
upon
to
worship
such
a
god
to
get
upon
our
knees
and
tell
him
that
he
is
good
that
he
is
merciful
that
he
is
just
that
he
is
love
we
are
asked
to
stifle
every
noble
sentiment
of
the
soul
and
to
trample
under
foot
all
the
sweet
charities
of
the
heart
because
we
refuse
to
stultify
ourselves
refuse
to
become
liars
we
are
denounced
hated
traduced
and
ostracized
here
and
this
same
god
threatens
to
torment
us
in
eternal
fire
the
moment
death
allows
him
to
fiercely
clutch
our
naked
helpless
souls
let
the
people
hate
let
the
god
threaten
we
will
educate
them
and
we
will
despise
and
defy
him
the
book
called
the
bible
is
filled
with
passages
equally
horrible
unjust
and
atrocious
this
is
the
book
to
read
in
schools
in
order
to
make
our
children
loving
kind
and
gentle
this
is
the
book
recognized
in
our
constitution
as
the
source
of
authority
and
justice
strange
that
no
one
has
ever
been
persecuted
by
the
church
for
believing
god
bad
while
hundreds
of
millions
have
been
destroyed
for
thinking
him
good
the
orthodox
church
never
will
forgive
the
universalist
for
saying
god
is
love
it
has
always
been
considered
as
one
of
the
very
highest
evidence
of
true
and
undefiled
religion
to
insist
that
all
men
women
and
children
deserve
eternal
damnation
it
has
always
been
heresy
to
say
god
will
at
last
save
all
we
are
asked
to
justify
these
frightful
passages
these
infamous
laws
of
war
because
the
bible
is
the
word
of
god
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
never
was
and
there
never
can
be
an
argument
even
tending
to
prove
the
inspiration
of
any
book
whatever
in
the
absence
of
positive
evidence
analogy
and
experience
argument
is
simply
impossible
and
at
the
very
best
can
amount
only
to
a
useless
agitation
of
the
air
the
instant
we
admit
that
a
book
is
too
sacred
to
be
doubted
or
even
reasoned
about
we
are
mental
serfs
it
is
infinitely
absurd
to
suppose
that
a
god
would
address
a
communication
to
intelligent
beings
and
yet
make
it
a
crime
to
be
punished
in
eternal
flames
for
them
to
use
their
intelligence
for
the
purpose
of
understanding
his
communication
if
we
have
the
right
to
use
our
reason
we
certainly
have
the
right
to
act
in
accordance
with
it
and
no
god
can
have
the
right
to
punish
us
for
such
action
the
doctrine
that
future
happiness
depends
upon
belief
is
monstrous
it
is
the
infamy
of
infamies
the
notion
that
faith
in
christ
is
to
be
rewarded
by
an
eternity
of
bliss
while
a
dependence
upon
reason
observation
and
experience
merits
everlasting
pain
is
too
absurd
for
refutation
and
can
be
relieved
only
by
that
unhappy
mixture
of
insanity
and
ignorance
called
faith
what
man
who
ever
thinks
can
believe
that
blood
can
appease
god
and
yet
our
entire
system
of
religion
is
based
upon
that
belief
the
jews
pacified
jehovah
with
the
blood
of
animals
and
according
to
the
christian
system
the
blood
of
jesus
softened
the
heart
of
god
a
little
and
rendered
possible
the
salvation
of
a
fortunate
few
it
is
hard
to
conceive
how
the
human
mind
can
give
assent
to
such
terrible
ideas
or
how
any
sane
man
can
read
the
bible
and
still
believe
in
the
doctrine
of
inspiration
whether
the
bible
is
true
or
false
is
of
no
consequence
in
comparison
with
the
mental
freedom
of
the
race
salvation
through
slavery
is
worthless
salvation
from
slavery
is
inestimable
as
long
as
man
believes
the
bible
to
be
infallible
that
is
his
master
the
civilization
of
this
century
is
not
the
child
of
faith
but
of
unbelief
the
result
of
free
thought
all
that
is
necessary
as
it
seems
to
me
to
convince
any
reasonable
person
that
the
bible
is
simply
and
purely
of
human
invention
of
barbarian
invention
is
to
read
it
read
it
as
you
would
any
other
book
think
of
it
as
you
would
any
other
get
the
bandage
of
reverence
from
your
eyes
drive
from
your
heart
the
phantom
of
fear
push
from
the
throne
of
your
brain
the
cowled
form
of
superstition
then
read
the
holy
bible
and
you
will
be
amazed
that
you
ever
for
one
moment
supposed
a
being
of
infinite
wisdom
goodness
and
purity
to
be
the
author
of
such
ignorance
and
of
such
atrocity
our
ancestors
not
only
had
their
but
they
made
devils
as
well
these
devils
were
generally
disgraced
and
fallen
gods
some
had
headed
unsuccessful
revolts
some
had
been
caught
sweetly
reclining
in
the
shadowy
folds
of
some
fleecy
clouds
kissing
the
wife
of
the
god
of
gods
these
devils
generally
sympathized
with
man
there
is
in
regard
to
them
a
most
wonderful
fact
in
nearly
all
the
theologies
mythologic
and
religious
the
devils
have
been
much
more
humane
and
merciful
than
the
gods
no
devil
ever
gave
one
of
his
generals
an
order
to
kill
children
and
to
rip
open
the
bodies
of
pregnant
women
such
barbarities
were
always
ordered
by
the
good
gods
the
pestilences
were
sent
by
the
most
merciful
gods
the
frightful
famine
during
which
the
dying
child
with
pallid
lips
sucked
the
withered
bosom
of
a
dead
mother
was
sent
by
the
loving
gods
no
devil
was
ever
charged
with
such
fiendish
brutality
one
of
these
gods
according
to
the
account
drowned
an
entire
world
with
the
exception
of
eight
persons
the
old
the
young
the
beautiful
and
the
helpless
were
remorselessly
devoured
by
the
shoreless
sea
this
the
most
fearful
tragedy
that
the
imagination
of
ignorant
priests
ever
conceived
was
the
act
not
of
a
devil
but
of
god
whom
men
ignorantly
worship
unto
this
day
what
a
stain
such
an
act
would
leave
upon
the
character
of
a
devil
one
of
the
prophets
of
one
of
these
gods
having
in
his
power
a
captured
king
hewed
him
in
pieces
in
the
sight
of
all
the
people
was
ever
any
imp
of
any
devil
guilty
of
such
savagery
one
of
these
gods
is
reported
to
have
given
the
following
directions
concerning
human
slavery
if
thou
buy
a
hebrew
servant
six
years
shall
he
serve
and
in
the
seventh
he
shall
go
out
free
for
nothing
if
he
came
in
by
himself
he
shall
go
out
by
himself
if
he
were
married
then
his
wife
shall
go
out
with
him
if
his
master
have
given
him
a
wife
and
she
have
borne
him
sons
or
daughters
the
wife
and
her
children
shall
be
her
master
and
he
shall
go
out
by
himself
and
if
the
servant
shall
plainly
say
i
love
my
master
my
wife
and
my
children
i
will
not
go
out
free
then
his
master
shall
bring
him
unto
the
judges
he
shall
also
bring
him
unto
the
door
or
unto
the
doorpost
and
his
master
shall
bore
his
ear
with
an
awl
and
he
shall
serve
him
forever
according
to
this
a
man
was
given
liberty
upon
condition
that
he
would
desert
forever
his
wife
and
children
did
any
devil
ever
force
upon
a
husband
upon
a
father
so
cruel
and
so
heartless
an
alternative
who
can
worship
such
a
god
who
can
bend
the
knee
to
such
a
monster
who
can
pray
to
such
a
fiend
all
these
gods
threatened
to
torment
forever
the
souls
of
their
enemies
did
any
devil
ever
make
so
infamous
a
threat
the
basest
thing
recorded
of
the
devil
is
what
he
did
concerning
job
and
his
family
and
that
was
done
by
the
express
permission
of
one
of
these
gods
and
to
decide
a
little
difference
of
opinion
between
their
serene
highnesses
as
to
the
character
of
my
servant
job
the
first
account
we
have
of
the
devil
is
found
in
that
purely
scientific
book
called
genesis
and
is
as
follows
now
the
serpent
was
more
subtle
than
any
beast
of
the
field
which
the
lord
god
had
made
and
he
said
unto
the
woman
yea
hath
god
said
ye
shall
not
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
trees
of
the
garden
and
the
woman
said
unto
the
serpent
we
may
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
trees
of
the
garden
but
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
which
is
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
god
hath
said
ye
shall
not
eat
of
it
neither
shall
ye
touch
it
lest
ye
die
and
the
serpent
said
unto
the
woman
ye
shall
not
surely
die
for
god
doth
know
that
in
the
day
ye
eat
thereof
then
your
eyes
shall
be
opened
and
ye
shall
be
as
gods
knowing
good
and
evil
and
when
the
woman
saw
that
the
tree
was
good
for
food
and
that
it
was
pleasant
to
the
eyes
and
a
tree
to
be
desired
to
make
one
wise
she
took
of
the
fruit
thereof
and
did
eat
and
gave
also
unto
her
husband
with
her
and
he
did
eat
and
the
lord
god
said
behold
the
man
has
become
as
one
of
us
to
know
good
and
evil
and
now
lest
he
put
forth
his
hand
and
take
also
of
the
tree
of
life
and
eat
and
live
forever
therefore
the
lord
god
sent
him
forth
from
the
garden
of
eden
to
till
the
ground
from
which
he
was
taken
so
he
drove
out
the
man
and
he
placed
at
the
east
of
the
garden
of
eden
cherubims
and
a
flaming
sword
which
turned
every
way
to
keep
the
way
of
the
tree
of
life
according
to
this
account
the
promise
of
the
devil
was
fulfilled
to
the
very
letter
adam
and
eve
did
not
die
and
they
did
become
as
gods
knowing
good
and
evil
the
account
shows
however
that
the
gods
dreaded
education
and
knowledge
then
just
as
they
do
now
the
church
still
faithfully
guards
the
dangerous
tree
of
knowledge
and
has
exerted
in
all
ages
her
utmost
power
to
keep
mankind
from
eating
the
fruit
thereof
the
priests
have
never
ceased
repeating
the
old
falsehood
and
the
old
threat
ye
shall
not
eat
of
it
neither
shall
ye
touch
it
lest
ye
die
from
every
pulpit
comes
the
same
cry
born
of
the
same
fear
lest
they
eat
and
become
as
gods
knowing
good
and
evil
for
this
reason
religion
hates
science
faith
detests
reason
theology
is
the
sworn
enemy
of
philosophy
and
the
church
with
its
flaming
sword
still
guards
the
hated
tree
and
like
its
supposed
founder
curses
to
the
lowest
depths
the
brave
thinkers
who
eat
and
become
as
gods
if
the
account
given
in
genesis
is
really
true
ought
we
not
after
all
to
thank
this
serpent
he
was
the
first
schoolmaster
the
first
advocate
of
learning
the
first
enemy
of
ignorance
the
first
to
whisper
in
human
ears
the
sacred
word
liberty
the
creator
of
ambition
the
author
of
modesty
of
inquiry
of
doubt
of
investigation
of
progress
and
of
civilization
give
me
the
storm
and
tempest
of
thought
and
action
rather
than
the
dead
calm
of
ignorance
and
faith
banish
me
from
eden
when
you
will
but
first
let
me
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
some
nations
have
borrowed
their
gods
of
this
number
we
are
compelled
to
say
is
our
own
the
jews
having
ceased
to
exist
as
a
nation
and
having
no
further
use
for
a
god
our
ancestors
appropriated
him
and
adopted
their
devil
at
the
same
time
this
borrowed
god
is
still
an
object
of
some
adoration
and
this
adopted
devil
still
excites
the
apprehensions
of
our
people
he
is
still
supposed
to
be
setting
his
traps
and
snares
for
the
purpose
of
catching
our
unwary
souls
and
is
still
with
reasonable
success
waging
the
old
war
against
our
god
to
me
it
seems
easy
to
account
for
these
ideas
concerning
gods
and
devils
they
are
a
perfectly
natural
production
man
has
created
them
all
and
under
the
same
circumstances
will
create
them
again
man
has
not
only
created
all
these
gods
but
he
has
created
them
out
of
the
materials
by
which
he
has
been
surrounded
generally
he
has
modeled
them
after
himself
and
has
given
them
hands
heads
feet
eyes
ears
and
organs
of
speech
each
nation
made
its
gods
and
devils
speak
its
language
not
only
but
put
in
their
mouths
the
same
mistakes
in
history
geography
astronomy
and
in
all
matters
of
fact
generally
made
by
the
people
no
god
was
ever
in
advance
of
the
nation
that
created
him
the
negroes
represented
their
deities
with
black
skins
and
curly
hair
the
mongolian
gave
to
his
a
yellow
complexion
and
dark
eyes
the
jews
were
not
allowed
to
paint
theirs
or
we
should
have
seen
jehovah
with
a
full
beard
an
oval
face
and
an
aquiline
nose
zeus
was
a
perfect
greek
and
jove
looked
as
though
a
member
of
the
roman
senate
the
gods
of
egypt
had
the
patient
face
and
placid
look
of
the
loving
people
who
made
them
the
gods
of
northern
countries
were
represented
warmly
clad
in
robes
of
fur
those
of
the
tropics
were
naked
the
gods
of
india
were
often
mounted
upon
elephants
those
of
some
islanders
were
great
swimmers
and
the
deities
of
the
arctic
zone
were
passionately
fond
of
whale
blubber
nearly
all
people
have
carved
or
painted
representations
of
their
gods
and
these
representations
were
by
the
lower
classes
generally
treated
as
the
real
gods
and
to
these
images
and
idols
they
addressed
prayers
and
offered
sacrifice
in
some
countries
even
at
this
day
if
the
people
after
long
praying
do
not
obtain
their
desires
they
turn
their
images
off
as
impotent
gods
or
upbraid
them
in
a
most
reproachful
manner
loading
them
with
blows
and
curses
now
dog
of
a
spirit
they
say
give
you
lodging
in
a
magnificent
temple
we
gild
you
with
gold
feed
you
with
the
choicest
food
and
offer
incense
to
you
yet
after
all
this
care
you
are
so
ungrateful
as
to
refuse
us
what
we
ask
hereupon
they
will
pull
the
god
down
and
drag
him
through
the
filth
of
the
street
if
in
the
meantime
it
happens
that
they
obtain
their
request
then
with
a
great
deal
of
ceremony
they
wash
him
clean
carry
him
back
and
place
him
in
his
temple
again
where
they
fall
down
and
make
excuses
for
what
they
have
done
a
truth
they
say
were
a
little
too
hasty
and
you
were
a
little
too
long
in
your
grant
why
should
you
bring
this
beating
on
yourself
but
what
is
done
can
not
be
undone
let
us
not
think
of
it
any
more
if
you
will
forget
what
is
past
we
will
gild
you
over
brighter
again
than
before
man
has
never
been
at
a
loss
for
gods
he
has
worshiped
almost
everything
including
the
vilest
and
most
disgusting
beasts
he
has
worshiped
fire
earth
air
water
light
stars
and
for
hundreds
of
ages
prostrated
himself
before
enormous
snakes
savage
tribes
often
make
gods
of
articles
they
get
from
civilized
people
the
todas
worship
a
the
kotas
worship
two
silver
plates
which
they
regard
as
husband
and
wife
and
another
tribe
manufactured
a
god
out
of
a
king
of
hearts
man
having
always
been
the
physical
superior
of
woman
accounts
for
the
fact
that
most
of
the
high
gods
have
been
males
had
woman
been
the
physical
superior
the
powers
supposed
to
be
the
ruler
of
nature
would
have
been
woman
and
instead
of
being
represented
in
the
apparel
of
man
they
would
have
luxuriated
in
trains
low
necked
dresses
laces
and
nothing
can
be
plainer
than
that
each
nation
gives
to
its
god
its
peculiar
characteristics
and
that
every
individual
gives
to
his
god
his
personal
peculiarities
man
has
no
ideas
and
can
have
none
except
those
suggested
by
his
surroundings
he
can
not
conceive
of
anything
utterly
unlike
what
he
has
seen
or
felt
he
can
exaggerate
diminish
combine
separate
deform
beautify
improve
multiply
and
compare
what
he
sees
what
he
feels
what
he
hears
and
all
of
which
he
takes
cognizance
through
the
medium
of
the
senses
but
he
can
not
create
having
seen
exhibitions
of
power
he
can
say
omnipotent
having
lived
he
can
say
immortality
knowing
something
of
time
he
can
say
eternity
conceiving
something
of
intelligence
he
can
say
god
having
seen
exhibitions
of
malice
he
can
say
devil
a
few
gleams
of
happiness
having
fallen
athwart
the
gloom
of
his
life
he
can
say
heaven
pain
in
its
numberless
forms
having
been
experienced
he
can
say
hell
yet
all
these
ideas
have
a
foundation
in
fact
and
only
a
foundation
the
superstructure
has
been
reared
by
exaggerating
diminishing
combining
separating
deforming
beautifying
improving
or
multiplying
realities
so
that
the
edifice
or
fabric
is
but
the
incongruous
grouping
of
what
man
has
perceived
through
the
medium
of
the
senses
it
is
as
though
we
should
give
to
a
lion
the
wings
of
an
eagle
the
hoofs
of
a
bison
the
tail
of
a
horse
the
pouch
of
a
kangaroo
and
the
trunk
of
an
elephant
we
have
in
imagination
created
an
impossible
monster
and
yet
the
various
parts
of
this
monster
really
exist
so
it
is
with
all
the
gods
that
man
has
made
beyond
nature
man
can
not
go
even
in
thought
above
nature
he
can
not
rise
below
nature
he
can
not
fall
man
in
his
ignorance
supposed
that
all
phenomena
were
produced
by
some
intelligent
powers
and
with
direct
reference
to
him
to
preserve
friendly
relations
with
these
powers
was
and
still
is
the
object
of
all
religions
man
knelt
through
fear
and
to
implore
assistance
or
through
gratitude
for
some
favor
which
he
supposed
had
been
rendered
he
endeavored
by
supplication
to
appease
some
being
who
for
some
reason
had
as
he
believed
become
enraged
the
lightning
and
thunder
terrified
him
in
the
presence
of
the
volcano
he
sank
upon
his
knees
the
great
forests
filled
with
wild
and
ferocious
beasts
the
monstrous
serpents
crawling
in
mysterious
depths
the
boundless
sea
the
flaming
comets
the
sinister
eclipses
the
awful
calmness
of
the
stars
and
more
than
all
the
perpetual
presence
of
death
convinced
him
that
he
was
the
sport
and
prey
of
unseen
and
malignant
powers
the
strange
and
frightful
diseases
to
which
he
was
subject
the
freezings
and
burnings
of
fever
the
contortions
of
epilepsy
the
sudden
palsies
the
darkness
of
night
and
the
wild
terrible
and
fantastic
dreams
that
filled
his
brain
satisfied
him
that
he
was
haunted
and
pursued
by
countless
spirits
of
evil
for
some
reason
he
supposed
that
these
spirits
differed
in
power
that
they
were
not
all
alike
malevolent
that
the
higher
controlled
the
lower
and
that
his
very
existence
depended
upon
gaining
the
assistance
of
the
more
powerful
for
this
purpose
he
resorted
to
prayer
to
flattery
to
worship
and
to
sacrifice
these
ideas
appear
to
have
been
almost
universal
in
savage
man
for
ages
all
nations
supposed
that
the
sick
and
insane
were
possessed
by
evil
spirits
for
thousands
of
years
the
practice
of
medicine
consisted
in
frightening
these
spirits
away
usually
the
priests
would
make
the
loudest
and
most
discordant
noises
possible
they
would
blow
horns
beat
upon
rude
drums
clash
cymbals
and
in
the
meantime
utter
the
most
unearthly
yells
if
the
failed
they
would
implore
the
aid
of
some
more
powerful
spirit
to
pacify
these
spirits
was
considered
of
infinite
importance
the
poor
barbarian
knowing
that
men
could
be
softened
by
gifts
gave
to
these
spirits
that
which
to
him
seemed
of
the
most
value
with
bursting
heart
he
would
offer
the
blood
of
his
dearest
child
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
conceive
of
a
god
utterly
unlike
himself
and
he
naturally
supposed
that
these
powers
of
the
air
would
be
affected
a
little
at
the
sight
of
so
great
and
so
deep
a
sorrow
it
was
with
the
barbarian
then
as
with
the
civilized
now
one
class
lived
upon
and
made
merchandise
of
the
fears
of
another
certain
persons
took
it
upon
themselves
to
appease
the
gods
and
to
instruct
the
people
in
their
duties
to
these
unseen
powers
this
was
the
origin
of
the
priesthood
the
priest
pretended
to
stand
between
the
wrath
of
the
gods
and
the
helplessness
of
man
he
was
man
attorney
at
the
court
of
heaven
he
carried
to
the
invisible
world
a
flag
of
truce
a
protest
and
a
request
he
came
back
with
a
command
with
authority
and
with
power
man
fell
upon
his
knees
before
his
own
servant
and
the
priest
taking
advantage
of
the
awe
inspired
by
his
supposed
influence
with
the
gods
made
of
his
a
cringing
hypocrite
and
slave
even
christ
the
supposed
son
of
god
taught
that
persons
were
possessed
of
evil
spirits
and
frequently
according
to
the
account
gave
proof
of
his
divine
origin
and
mission
by
frightening
droves
of
devils
out
of
his
unfortunate
countrymen
casting
out
devils
was
his
principal
employment
and
the
devils
thus
banished
generally
took
occasion
to
acknowledge
him
as
the
true
messiah
which
was
not
only
very
kind
of
them
but
quite
fortunate
for
him
the
religious
people
have
always
regarded
the
testimony
of
these
devils
as
perfectly
conclusive
and
the
writers
of
the
new
testament
quote
the
words
of
these
imps
of
darkness
with
great
satisfaction
the
fact
that
christ
could
withstand
the
temptations
of
the
devil
was
considered
as
conclusive
evidence
that
he
was
assisted
by
some
god
or
at
least
by
some
being
superior
to
man
matthew
gives
an
account
of
an
attempt
made
by
the
devil
to
tempt
the
supposed
son
of
god
and
it
has
always
excited
the
wonder
of
christians
that
the
temptation
was
so
nobly
and
heroically
withstood
the
account
to
which
i
refer
is
as
follows
then
was
jesus
led
up
of
the
spirit
into
the
wilderness
to
be
tempted
of
the
devil
and
when
the
tempter
came
to
him
he
said
thou
be
the
son
of
god
command
that
these
stones
be
made
bread
but
he
answered
and
said
is
written
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
god
then
the
devil
taketh
him
up
into
the
holy
city
and
setteth
him
upon
a
pinnacle
of
the
temple
and
saith
unto
him
thou
be
the
son
of
god
cast
thyself
down
for
it
is
written
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
concerning
thee
lest
at
any
time
thou
shalt
dash
thy
foot
against
a
stone
jesus
said
unto
him
is
written
again
thou
shalt
not
tempt
the
lord
thy
god
again
the
devil
taketh
him
up
into
an
exceeding
high
mountain
and
showeth
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
and
the
glory
of
them
and
saith
unto
him
these
will
i
give
thee
if
thou
wilt
fall
down
and
worship
me
the
christians
now
claim
that
jesus
was
god
if
he
was
god
of
course
the
devil
knew
that
fact
and
yet
according
to
this
account
the
devil
took
the
omnipotent
god
and
placed
him
upon
a
pinnacle
of
the
temple
and
endeavored
to
induce
him
to
dash
himself
against
the
earth
failing
in
that
he
took
the
creator
owner
and
governor
of
the
universe
up
into
an
exceeding
high
mountain
and
offered
him
this
world
this
grain
of
sand
if
he
the
god
of
all
the
worlds
would
fall
down
and
worship
him
a
poor
devil
without
even
a
tax
title
to
one
foot
of
dirt
is
it
possible
the
devil
was
such
an
idiot
should
any
great
credit
be
given
to
this
deity
for
not
being
caught
with
such
chaff
think
of
it
the
devil
the
prince
of
sharpers
the
king
of
cunning
the
master
of
finesse
trying
to
bribe
god
with
a
grain
of
sand
that
belonged
to
god
is
there
in
ail
the
religious
literature
of
the
world
any
thing
more
grossly
absurd
than
this
these
devils
according
to
the
bible
were
various
kinds
some
could
speak
and
hear
others
were
deaf
and
dumb
all
could
not
be
cast
out
in
the
same
way
the
deaf
and
dumb
spirits
were
quite
difficult
to
deal
with
mark
tells
of
a
gentleman
who
brought
his
son
to
christ
the
boy
it
seems
was
possessed
of
a
dumb
spirit
over
which
the
disciples
had
no
control
jesus
said
unto
the
spirit
dumb
and
deaf
spirit
i
charge
thee
come
out
of
him
and
enter
no
more
into
him
whereupon
the
deaf
spirit
having
heard
what
was
said
cried
out
being
dumb
and
immediately
vacated
the
premises
the
ease
with
which
christ
controlled
this
deaf
and
dumb
spirit
excited
the
wonder
of
his
disciples
and
they
asked
him
privately
why
they
could
not
cast
that
spirit
out
to
whom
he
replied
this
kind
can
come
forth
by
nothing
but
prayer
and
fasting
is
there
a
christian
in
the
whole
world
who
would
believe
such
a
story
if
found
in
any
other
book
the
trouble
is
these
pious
people
shut
up
their
reason
and
then
open
their
bible
in
the
olden
times
the
existence
of
devils
was
universally
admitted
the
people
had
no
doubt
upon
that
subject
and
from
such
belief
it
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
a
person
in
order
to
vanquish
these
devils
had
either
to
be
a
god
or
to
be
assisted
by
one
all
founders
of
religions
have
established
their
claims
to
divine
origin
by
controlling
evil
spirits
and
suspending
the
laws
of
nature
casting
out
devils
was
a
certificate
of
divinity
a
prophet
unable
to
cope
with
the
powers
of
darkness
was
regarded
with
contempt
the
utterance
of
the
highest
and
noblest
sentiments
the
most
blameless
and
holy
life
commanded
but
little
respect
unless
accompanied
by
power
to
work
miracles
and
command
spirits
this
belief
in
good
and
evil
powers
had
its
origin
in
the
fact
that
man
was
surrounded
by
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
good
and
evil
phenomena
phenomena
affecting
man
pleasantly
were
ascribed
to
good
spirits
while
those
affecting
him
unpleasantly
or
injuriously
were
ascribed
to
evil
spirits
it
being
admitted
that
all
phenomena
were
produced
by
spirits
the
spirits
were
divided
according
to
the
phenomena
and
the
phenomena
were
good
or
bad
as
they
affected
man
good
spirits
were
supposed
to
be
the
authors
of
good
phenomena
and
evil
spirits
of
the
evil
so
that
the
idea
of
a
devil
has
been
as
universal
as
the
idea
of
a
god
many
writers
maintain
that
an
idea
to
become
universal
must
be
true
that
all
universal
ideas
are
innate
and
that
innate
ideas
can
not
be
false
if
the
fact
that
an
idea
has
been
universal
proves
that
it
is
innate
and
if
the
fact
that
an
idea
is
innate
proves
that
it
is
correct
then
the
believer
in
innate
ideas
must
admit
that
the
evidence
of
a
god
superior
to
nature
and
of
a
devil
superior
to
nature
is
exactly
the
same
and
that
the
existence
of
such
a
devil
must
be
as
as
the
existence
of
such
a
god
the
truth
is
a
god
was
inferred
from
good
and
a
devil
from
bad
phenomena
and
it
is
just
as
natural
and
logical
to
suppose
that
a
devil
would
cause
happiness
as
to
suppose
that
a
god
would
produce
misery
consequently
if
an
intelligence
infinite
and
supreme
is
the
immediate
author
of
all
phenomena
it
is
difficult
to
determine
whether
such
intelligence
is
the
friend
or
enemy
of
man
if
phenomena
were
all
good
we
might
say
they
were
all
produced
by
a
perfectly
beneficent
being
if
they
were
all
bad
we
might
say
they
were
produced
by
a
perfectly
malevolent
power
but
as
phenomena
are
as
they
affect
man
both
good
and
bad
they
must
be
produced
by
different
and
antagonistic
spirits
by
one
who
is
sometimes
actuated
by
kindness
and
sometimes
by
malice
or
all
must
be
produced
of
necessity
and
without
reference
to
their
consequences
upon
man
the
foolish
doctrine
that
all
phenomena
can
be
traced
to
the
interference
of
good
and
evil
spirits
has
been
and
still
is
almost
universal
that
most
people
still
believe
in
some
spirit
that
can
change
the
natural
order
of
events
is
proven
by
the
fact
that
nearly
all
resort
to
prayer
thousands
at
this
very
moment
are
probably
imploring
some
supposed
power
to
interfere
in
their
behalf
some
want
health
restored
some
ask
that
the
loved
and
absent
be
watched
over
and
protected
some
pray
for
riches
some
for
rain
some
want
diseases
stayed
some
vainly
ask
for
food
some
ask
for
revivals
a
few
ask
for
more
wisdom
and
now
and
then
one
tells
the
lord
to
do
as
he
thinks
best
thousands
ask
to
be
protected
from
the
devil
some
like
david
pray
for
revenge
and
some
implore
even
god
not
to
lead
them
into
temptation
all
these
prayers
rest
upon
and
are
produced
by
the
idea
that
some
power
not
only
can
but
probably
will
change
the
order
of
the
universe
this
belief
has
been
among
the
great
majority
of
tribes
and
nations
all
sacred
books
are
filled
with
the
accounts
of
such
interferences
and
our
own
bible
is
no
exception
to
this
rule
if
we
believe
in
a
power
superior
to
nature
it
is
perfectly
natural
to
suppose
that
such
power
can
and
will
interfere
in
the
affairs
of
this
world
if
there
is
no
interference
of
what
practical
use
can
such
power
be
the
scriptures
give
us
the
most
wonderful
accounts
of
divine
interference

he

upon
the

it
is
enough
to
make
one
almost
insane
with
pity
to
think
what
man
in
the
long
night
has
suffered
of
the
tortures
he
has
endured
surrounded
as
he
supposed
by
malignant
powers
and
clutched
by
the
fierce
phantoms
of
the
air
no
wonder
that
he
fell
upon
his
trembling
knees
that
he
built
altars
and
reddened
them
even
with
his
own
blood
no
wonder
that
he
implored
ignorant
priests

impudent
magicians
for
aid
no
wonder
that
he
crawled
groveling
in
the
dust
to
the
door

there
in
the
insanity

despair

savage
as

emerges
from

gradually
loses
faith
in
his
idols
of
wood
and
stone
and
in
their
place
puts
a
multitude
of
spirits
as
he
advances
in
knowledge
he
generally
discards
the
petty
spirits
and
in
their
stead
believes
in
one
whom
he
supposes
to
be
infinite
and
supreme
supposing
this
great
spirit
to
be
superior

he
offers
worship
or
flattery

for
assistance
at

finding
that

obtains
no
aid
from
this
supposed
deity
finding
that
every
search
after
the
absolute
must
of
necessity
end
in
failure
finding
that
man
can
not
by
any
possibility
conceive
of
the
conditionless
he
begins
to
investigate
the
facts
by
which
he
is
surrounded
and
to
depend
upon
himself
the
people
are
beginning
to
think
to
reason
and
to
investigate
slowly
painfully
but
surely
the
gods
are
being
driven
from
the
earth
only
upon
rare
occasions
are
they
even
by
the
most
religious
supposed
to
interfere
in
the
affairs
of
men
in
most
matters
we
are
at
last
supposed
to
be
free
since
the
invention
of
steamships
and
railways
so
that
the
products
of
all
countries
can
be
easily
interchanged
the
gods
have
quit
the
business
of
producing
famine
now
and
then
they
kill
a
child
because
it
is
idolized
by
its
parents
as
a
rule
they
have
given
up
causing
accidents
on
railroads
exploding
boilers
and
bursting
kerosene
lamps
cholera
yellow
fever
and
smallpox
are
still
considered
heavenly
weapons
but
measles
itch
and
ague
are
now
attributed
to
natural
causes
as
a
general
thing
the
gods
have
stopped
drowning
children
except
as
a
punishment
for
violating
the
sabbath
they
still
pay
some
attention
to
the
affairs
of
kings
men
of
genius
and
persons
of
great
wealth
but
ordinary
people
are
left
to
shift
for
themselves
as
best
they
may
in
wars
between
great
nations
the
gods
still
interfere
but
in
prize
fights
the
best
man
with
an
honest
referee
is
almost
sure
to
win
the
church
can
not
abandon
the
idea
of
special
providence
to
give
up
that
doctrine
is
to
give
up
all
the
church
must
insist
that
prayer
is
answered
that
some
power
superior
to
nature
hears
and
grants
the
request
of
the
sincere
and
humble
christian
and
that
this
same
power
in
some
mysterious
way
provides
for
all
a
devout
clergyman
sought
every
opportunity
to
impress
upon
the
mind
of
his
son
the
fact
that
god
takes
care
of
all
his
creatures
that
the
falling
sparrow
attracts
his
attentions
and
that
his
loving
kindness
is
over
all
his
works
happening
one
day
to
see
a
crane
wading
in
quest
of
food
the
good
man
pointed
out
to
his
son
the
perfect
adaptation
of
the
crane
to
get
his
living
in
that
manner
see
said
he
how
his
legs
are
formed
for
wading
what
a
long
slender
bill
he
has
observe
how
nicely
he
folds
his
feet
when
putting
them
in
or
drawing
them
out
of
the
water
he
does
not
cause
the
slightest
ripple
he
is
thus
enabled
to
approach
the
fish
without
giving
them
any
notice
of
his
arrival
my
son
said
he
it
is
impossible
to
look
at
that
bird
without
recognizing
the
design
as
well
as
the
goodness
of
god
in
thus
providing
the
means
of
subsistence
yes
replied
the
boy
i
think
i
see
the
goodness
of
god
at
least
so
far
as
the
crane
is
concerned
but
after
all
father
do
you
think
the
arrangement
a
little
tough
on
the
fish
even
the
advanced
religionist
although
disbelieving
in
any
great
amount
of
interference
by
the
gods
in
this
age
of
the
world
still
thinks
that
in
the
beginning
some
god
made
the
laws
governing
the
universe
he
believes
that
in
consequence
of
these
laws
a
man
can
lift
a
greater
weight
with
than
without
a
lever
that
this
god
so
made
matter
and
so
established
the
order
of
things
that
two
bodies
can
not
occupy
the
same
space
at
the
same
time
so
that
a
body
once
put
in
motion
will
keep
moving
until
it
is
stopped
so
that
it
is
a
greater
distance
around
than
across
a
circle
so
that
a
perfect
square
has
four
equal
sides
instead
of
five
or
seven
he
insists
that
it
took
a
direct
interposition
of
providence
to
make
the
whole
greater
than
a
part
and
that
had
it
not
been
for
this
power
superior
to
nature
twice
one
might
have
been
more
than
twice
two
and
sticks
and
strings
might
have
had
only
one
end
apiece
like
the
old
scotch
divine
he
thanks
god
that
sunday
comes
at
the
end
instead
of
in
the
middle
of
the
week
and
that
death
comes
at
the
close
instead
of
at
the
commencement
of
life
thereby
giving
us
time
to
prepare
for
that
holy
day
and
that
most
solemn
event
these
religious
people
see
nothing
but
design
everywhere
and
personal
intelligent
interference
in
everything
they
insist
that
the
universe
has
been
created
and
that
the
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
is
perfectly
apparent
they
point
us
to
the
sunshine
to
the
flowers
to
the
april
rain
and
to
all
there
is
of
beauty
and
of
use
in
the
world
did
it
ever
occur
to
them
that
a
cancer
is
as
beautiful
in
its
development
as
is
the
reddest
rose
that
what
they
are
pleased
to
call
the
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
is
as
apparent
in
the
cancer
as
in
the
april
rain
how
beautiful
the
process
of
digestion
by
what
ingenious
methods
the
blood
is
poisoned
so
that
the
cancer
shall
have
food
by
what
wonderful
contrivances
the
entire
system
of
man
is
made
to
pay
tribute
to
this
divine
and
charming
cancer
see
by
what
admirable
instrumentalities
it
feeds
itself
from
the
surrounding
quivering
dainty
flesh
see
how
it
gradually
but
surely
expands
and
grows
by
what
marvelous
mechanism
it
is
supplied
with
long
and
slender
roots
that
reach
out
to
the
most
secret
nerves
of
pain
for
sustenance
and
life
what
beautiful
colors
it
presents
seen
through
the
microscope
it
is
a
miracle
of
order
and
beauty
all
the
ingenuity
of
man
can
not
stop
its
growth
think
of
the
amount
of
thought
it
must
have
required
to
invent
a
way
by
which
the
life
of
one
man
might
be
given
to
produce
one
cancer
is
it
possible
to
look
upon
it
and
doubt
that
there
is
design
in
the
universe
and
that
the
inventor
of
this
wonderful
cancer
must
be
infinitely
powerful
ingenious
and
good
we
are
told
that
the
universe
was
designed
and
created
and
that
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
that
matter
has
existed
from
eternity
but
that
it
is
perfectly
that
a
god
has
if
a
god
created
the
universe
then
there
must
have
been
a
time
when
he
commenced
to
create
back
of
that
time
there
must
have
been
an
eternity
during
which
there
had
existed
nothing
absolutely
nothing
except
this
supposed
god
according
to
this
theory
this
god
spent
an
eternity
so
to
speak
in
an
infinite
vacuum
and
in
perfect
idleness
admitting
that
a
god
did
create
the
universe
the
question
then
arises
of
what
did
he
create
it
it
certainly
was
not
made
of
nothing
nothing
considered
in
the
light
of
a
raw
material
is
a
most
decided
failure
it
follows
then
that
a
god
must
have
made
the
universe
out
of
himself
he
being
the
only
existence
the
universe
is
material
and
if
it
was
made
of
god
the
god
must
have
been
material
with
this
very
thought
in
his
mind
anaximander
of
miletus
said
creation
is
the
decomposition
of
the
infinite
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
the
earth
would
fall
to
the
sun
only
for
the
fact
that
it
is
attracted
by
other
worlds
and
those
worlds
must
be
attracted
by
other
worlds
still
beyond
them
and
so
on
without
end
this
proves
the
material
universe
to
be
infinite
if
an
infinite
universe
has
been
made
out
of
an
infinite
god
how
much
of
the
god
is
left
the
idea
of
a
creative
deity
is
gradually
being
abandoned
and
nearly
all
truly
scientific
minds
admit
that
matter
must
have
existed
from
eternity
it
is
indestructible
and
the
indestructible
can
not
be
created
it
is
the
crowning
glory
of
our
century
to
have
demonstrated
the
indestructibility
and
the
eternal
persistence
of
force
neither
matter
nor
force
can
be
increased
nor
diminished
force
can
not
exist
apart
from
matter
matter
exists
only
in
connection
with
force
and
consequently
a
force
apart
from
matter
and
superior
to
nature
is
a
demonstrated
impossibility
force
then
must
have
also
existed
from
eternity
and
could
not
have
been
created
matter
in
its
countless
forms
from
dead
earth
to
the
eyes
of
those
we
love
and
force
in
all
its
manifestations
from
simple
motions
to
the
grandest
thought
deny
creation
and
defy
control
thought
is
a
form
of
force
we
walk
with
the
same
force
with
which
we
think
man
is
an
organism
that
changes
several
forms
of
force
into
man
is
a
machine
into
which
we
put
what
we
call
food
and
produce
what
we
call
thought
think
of
that
wonderful
chemistry
by
which
bread
was
changed
into
the
divine
tragedy
of
hamlet
a
god
must
not
only
be
material
but
he
must
be
an
organism
capable
of
changing
other
forms
of
force
into
this
is
what
we
call
eating
therefore
if
the
god
thinks
he
must
eat
that
is
to
say
he
must
of
necessity
have
some
means
of
supplying
the
force
with
which
to
think
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
of
a
being
who
can
eternally
impart
force
to
matter
and
yet
have
no
means
of
supplying
the
force
thus
imparted
if
neither
matter
nor
force
were
created
what
evidence
have
we
then
of
the
existence
of
a
power
superior
to
nature
the
theologian
will
probably
reply
we
have
law
and
order
cause
and
effect
and
beside
all
this
matter
could
not
have
put
itself
in
motion
suppose
for
the
sake
of
an
argument
that
there
is
no
being
superior
to
nature
and
that
matter
and
force
have
existed
from
eternity
now
suppose
that
two
atoms
should
come
together
would
there
be
an
effect
yes
suppose
they
came
in
exactly
opposite
directions
with
equal
force
they
would
be
stopped
to
say
the
least
this
would
be
an
effect
if
this
is
so
then
you
have
matter
force
and
effect
without
a
being
superior
to
nature
now
suppose
that
two
other
atoms
just
like
the
first
two
should
come
together
under
precisely
the
same
circumstances
would
not
the
effect
be
exactly
the
same
yes
like
causes
producing
like
effects
is
what
we
mean
by
law
and
order
then
we
have
matter
force
effect
law
and
order
without
a
being
superior
to
nature
now
we
know
that
every
effect
must
also
be
a
cause
and
that
every
cause
must
be
an
effect
the
atoms
coming
together
did
produce
an
effect
and
as
every
effect
must
also
be
a
cause
the
effect
produced
by
the
collision
of
the
atoms
must
as
to
something
else
have
been
a
cause
then
we
have
matter
force
law
order
cause
and
effect
without
a
being
superior
to
nature
nothing
is
left
for
the
supernatural
but
empty
space
his
throne
is
a
void
and
his
boasted
realm
is
without
matter
without
force
without
law
without
cause
and
without
effect
but
what
put
all
this
matter
in
motion
if
matter
and
force
have
existed
from
eternity
then
matter
must
have
always
been
in
motion
there
can
be
no
force
without
motion
force
is
forever
active
and
there
is
and
there
can
be
no
cessation
if
therefore
matter
and
force
have
existed
from
eternity
so
has
motion
in
the
whole
universe
there
is
not
even
one
atom
in
a
state
of
rest
a
deity
outside
of
nature
exists
in
nothing
and
is
nothing
nature
embraces
with
infinite
arms
all
matter
and
all
force
that
which
is
beyond
her
grasp
is
destitute
of
both
and
can
hardly
be
worth
the
worship
and
adoration
even
of
a
man
there
is
but
one
way
to
demonstrate
the
existence
of
a
power
independent
of
and
superior
to
nature
and
that
is
by
breaking
if
only
for
one
moment
the
continuity
of
cause
and
effect
pluck
from
the
endless
chain
of
existence
one
little
link
stop
for
one
instant
the
grand
procession
and
you
have
shown
beyond
all
contradiction
that
nature
has
a
master
change
the
fact
just
for
one
second
that
matter
attracts
matter
and
a
god
appears
the
rudest
savage
has
always
known
this
fact
and
for
that
reason
always
demanded
the
evidence
of
miracle
the
founder
of
a
religion
must
be
able
to
turn
water
into
wine
cure
with
a
word
the
blind
and
lame
and
raise
with
a
simple
touch
the
dead
to
life
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
demonstrate
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
barbarian
disciple
that
he
was
superior
to
nature
in
times
of
ignorance
this
was
easy
to
do
the
credulity
of
the
savage
was
almost
boundless
to
him
the
marvelous
was
the
beautiful
the
mysterious
was
the
sublime
consequently
every
religion
has
for
its
foundation
a
miracle
that
is
to
say
a
violation
of
nature
that
is
to
say
a
falsehood
no
one
in
the
world
whole
history
ever
attempted
to
substantiate
a
truth
by
a
miracle
truth
scorns
the
assistance
of
miracle
nothing
but
falsehood
ever
attested
itself
by
signs
and
wonders
no
miracle
ever
was
performed
and
no
sane
man
ever
thought
he
had
performed
one
and
until
one
is
performed
there
can
be
no
evidence
of
the
existence
of
any
power
superior
to
and
independent
of
nature
the
church
wishes
us
to
believe
let
the
church
or
one
of
its
intellectual
saints
perform
a
miracle
and
we
will
believe
we
are
told
that
nature
has
a
superior
let
this
superior
for
one
single
instant
control
nature
and
we
will
admit
the
truth
of
your
assertion
we
have
heard
talk
enough
we
have
listened
to
all
the
drowsy
idealess
vapid
sermons
that
we
wish
to
hear
we
have
read
your
bible
and
the
works
of
your
best
minds
we
have
heard
your
prayers
your
solemn
groans
and
your
reverential
amens
all
these
amount
to
less
than
nothing
we
beg
at
the
doors
of
your
churches
for
just
one
little
fact
we
pass
our
hats
along
your
pews
and
under
your
pulpits
and
implore
you
for
just
one
fact
we
know
all
about
your
moldy
wonders
and
your
stale
miracles
we
want
this
year
fact
we
ask
only
one
give
us
one
fact
of
charity
your
miracles
are
too
ancient
the
witnesses
have
been
dead
for
nearly
two
thousand
years
their
reputations
for
truth
and
veracity
in
the
neighborhood
where
they
resided
is
wholly
unknown
to
us
give
us
a
new
miracle
and
substantiate
it
by
witnesses
who
still
have
the
cheerful
habit
of
living
in
this
world
do
not
send
us
to
jericho
to
hear
the
winding
horns
nor
put
us
in
the
fire
with
shadrach
moshech
and
abednego
do
not
compel
us
to
navigate
the
sea
with
captain
jonah
nor
dine
with
ezekiel
there
is
no
sort
of
use
in
sending
us
with
samson
we
have
positively
lost
interest
in
that
little
speech
so
eloquently
delivered
by
balaam
inspired
donkey
it
is
worse
than
useless
to
show
us
fishes
with
money
in
their
mouths
and
call
our
attention
to
vast
multitudes
stuffing
themselves
with
five
crackers
and
two
sardines
we
demand
a
new
miracle
and
we
demand
it
now
let
the
church
furnish
at
least
one
or
forever
after
hold
her
peace
in
the
olden
time
the
church
by
violating
the
order
of
nature
proved
the
existence
of
her
god
at
that
time
miracles
were
performed
with
the
most
astonishing
ease
they
became
so
common
that
the
church
ordered
her
priests
to
desist
and
now
this
same
church
the
people
having
found
so
little
sense
admits
not
only
that
she
can
not
perform
a
miracle
but
insists
that
absence
of
miracle
the
steady
unbroken
march
of
cause
and
effect
proves
the
existence
of
a
power
superior
to
nature
the
fact
is
however
that
the
indissoluble
chain
of
cause
and
effect
proves
exactly
the
contrary
sir
william
hamilton
one
of
the
pillars
of
modern
theology
in
discussing
this
very
subject
uses
the
following
language
the
phenomena
of
matter
taken
by
themselves
so
far
from
warranting
any
inference
to
the
existence
of
a
god
would
on
the
contrary
ground
even
an
argument
to
his
negation
the
phenomena
of
a
material
world
are
subjected
to
immutable
laws
are
produced
and
reproduced
in
the
same
invariable
succession
and
manifest
only
the
blind
force
of
mechanical
necessity
nature
is
but
an
endless
series
of
efficient
causes
she
can
not
create
but
she
eternally
transforms
there
was
no
beginning
and
there
can
be
no
end
the
best
minds
even
in
the
religious
world
admit
that
in
material
nature
there
is
no
evidence
of
what
they
are
pleased
to
call
a
god
they
find
their
evidence
in
the
phenomena
of
intelligence
and
very
innocently
assert
that
intelligence
is
above
and
in
fact
opposed
to
nature
they
insist
that
man
at
least
is
a
special
creation
that
he
had
somewhere
in
his
brain
a
divine
spark
a
little
portion
of
the
great
first
cause
they
say
that
matter
can
not
produce
thought
but
that
thought
can
produce
matter
they
tell
us
that
man
has
intelligence
and
therefore
there
must
be
an
intelligence
greater
than
his
why
not
say
god
has
intelligence
therefore
there
must
be
an
intelligence
greater
than
his
so
far
as
we
know
there
is
no
intelligence
apart
from
matter
we
can
not
conceive
of
thought
except
as
produced
within
a
brain
the
science
by
means
of
which
they
demonstrate
the
existence
of
an
impossible
intelligence
and
an
incomprehensible
power
is
called
metaphysics
or
theology
the
theologians
admit
that
the
phenomena
of
matter
tend
at
least
to
disprove
the
existence
of
any
power
superior
to
nature
because
in
such
phenomena
we
see
nothing
but
an
endless
chain
of
efficient
causes
nothing
but
the
force
of
a
mechanical
necessity
they
therefore
appeal
to
what
they
denominate
the
phenomena
of
mind
to
establish
this
superior
power
the
trouble
is
that
in
the
phenomena
of
mind
we
find
the
same
endless
chain
of
efficient
causes
the
same
mechanical
necessity
every
thought
must
have
had
an
efficient
cause
every
motive
every
desire
every
fear
hope
and
dream
must
have
been
necessarily
produced
there
is
no
room
in
the
mind
of
a
man
for
providence
or
change
the
facts
and
forces
governing
thought
are
as
absolute
as
those
governing
the
motions
of
the
planets
a
poem
is
produced
by
the
forces
of
nature
and
is
as
necessarily
and
naturally
produced
as
mountains
and
seas
you
will
seek
in
vain
for
a
thought
in
man
brain
without
its
efficient
cause
every
mental
operation
is
the
necessary
result
of
certain
facts
and
conditions
mental
phenomena
are
considered
more
complicated
than
those
of
matter
and
consequently
more
mysterious
being
more
mysterious
they
are
considered
better
evidence
of
the
existence
of
a
god
no
one
infers
a
god
from
the
simple
from
the
known
from
what
is
understood
but
from
the
complex
from
the
unknown
and
incomprehensible
our
ignorance
is
god
what
we
know
is
science
when
we
abandon
the
doctrine
that
some
infinite
being
created
matter
and
force
and
enacted
a
code
of
laws
for
their
government
the
idea
of
interference
will
be
lost
the
real
priest
will
then
be
not
the
of
some
pretended
deity
but
the
interpreter
of
nature
from
that
moment
the
church
ceases
to
exist
the
tapers
will
die
out
upon
the
dusty
altar
the
moths
will
eat
the
fading
velvet
of
pulpit
and
pew
the
bible
will
take
its
place
with
the
shastras
puranas
vedas
eddas
sagas
and
korans
and
the
fetters
of
a
degrading
faith
will
fall
from
the
minds
of
men
but
says
the
religionist
you
can
not
explain
everything
you
can
not
understand
everything
and
that
which
you
can
not
explain
that
which
you
do
not
comprehend
is
my
god
we
are
explaining
more
every
day
we
are
understanding
more
every
day
consequently
your
god
is
growing
smaller
every
day
nothing
daunted
the
religionist
then
insists
that
nothing
can
exist
without
a
cause
except
cause
and
that
this
uncaused
cause
is
god
to
this
we
again
replied
every
cause
must
produce
an
effect
because
until
it
does
produce
an
effect
it
is
not
a
cause
every
effect
must
in
its
turn
become
a
cause
therefore
in
the
nature
of
things
there
can
not
be
a
last
cause
for
the
reason
that
a
last
cause
would
necessarily
produce
an
effect
and
that
effect
must
of
necessity
become
a
cause
the
converse
of
these
propositions
must
be
true
every
effect
must
have
had
a
cause
and
every
cause
must
have
been
an
effect
therefore
there
could
have
been
no
first
cause
a
first
cause
is
just
as
impossible
as
a
last
effect
beyond
the
universe
there
is
nothing
and
within
the
universe
the
supernatural
does
not
and
can
not
exist
the
moment
these
great
truths
are
understood
and
admitted
a
belief
in
general
or
special
providence
becomes
impossible
from
that
instant
men
will
cease
their
vain
efforts
to
please
an
imaginary
being
and
will
give
their
time
and
attention
to
the
affairs
of
this
world
they
will
abandon
the
idea
of
attaining
any
object
by
prayer
and
supplication
the
element
of
uncertainty
will
in
a
great
measure
be
removed
from
the
domain
of
the
future
and
man
gathering
courage
from
a
succession
of
victories
over
the
obstructions
of
nature
will
attain
a
serene
grandeur
unknown
to
the
disciples
of
any
superstition
the
plans
of
mankind
will
no
longer
be
interfered
with
by
the
finger
of
a
supposed
omnipotence
and
no
one
will
believe
that
nations
or
individuals
are
protected
or
destroyed
by
any
deity
whatever
science
freed
from
the
chains
of
pious
custom
and
evangelical
prejudice
will
within
her
sphere
be
supreme
the
mind
will
investigate
without
reverence
and
publish
its
conclusions
without
fear
agassiz
will
no
longer
hesitate
to
declare
the
mosaic
cosmogony
utterly
inconsistent
with
the
demonstrated
truths
of
geology
and
will
cease
pretending
any
reverence
for
the
jewish
scriptures
the
moment
science
succeeds
in
rendering
the
church
powerless
for
evil
the
real
thinkers
will
be
outspoken
the
little
flags
of
truce
carried
by
timid
philosophers
will
disappear
and
the
cowardly
parley
will
give
place
to
victory
lasting
and
universal
if
we
admit
that
some
infinite
being
has
controlled
the
destinies
of
persons
and
people
history
becomes
a
most
cruel
and
bloody
farce
age
after
age
the
strong
have
trampled
upon
the
weak
the
crafty
and
heartless
have
ensnared
and
enslaved
the
simple
and
innocent
and
nowhere
in
all
the
annals
of
mankind
has
any
god
succored
the
oppressed
man
should
cease
to
expect
aid
from
on
high
by
this
time
he
should
know
that
heaven
has
no
ear
to
hear
and
no
hand
to
help
the
present
is
the
necessary
child
of
all
the
past
there
has
been
no
chance
and
there
can
be
no
interference
if
abuses
are
destroyed
man
must
destroy
them
if
slaves
are
freed
man
must
free
them
if
new
truths
are
discovered
man
must
discover
them
if
the
naked
are
clothed
if
the
hungry
are
fed
if
justice
is
done
if
labor
is
rewarded
if
superstition
is
driven
from
the
mind
if
the
defenseless
are
protected
and
if
the
right
finally
triumphs
all
must
be
the
work
of
man
the
grand
victories
of
the
future
must
be
won
by
man
and
by
man
alone
nature
so
far
as
we
can
discern
without
passion
and
without
intention
forms
transforms
and
retransforms
forever
she
neither
weeps
nor
rejoices
she
produces
man
without
purpose
and
obliterates
him
without
regret
she

so

hypocrisy
to
obtain
its

his
best
energies
have
been
wasted
in
the
service
of
this
phantom
the
horrors
of
witchcraft
were
all
born
of
an
ignorant
belief
in
the
existence
of
a
totally
depraved
being
superior
to
nature
acting
in
perfect
independence
of
her
laws
and
all
religious
superstition
has
had
for
its
basis
a
belief
in
at
least
two
beings
one
good
and
the
other
bad
both
of
whom
could
arbitrarily
change
the
order
of
the
universe
the
history
of
religion
is
simply
the
story
of
man
efforts
in
all
ages
to
avoid
one
of
these
powers
and
to
pacify
the
other
both
powers
have
inspired
little
else
than
abject
fear
the
cold
calculating
sneer
of
the
devil
and
the
frown
of
god
were
equally
terrible
in
any
event
man
fate
was
to
be
arbitrarily
fixed
forever
by
an
unknown
power
superior
to
all
law
and
to
all
fact
until
this
belief
is
thrown
aside
man
must
consider
himself
the
slave
of
phantom
masters
neither
of
whom
promise
liberty
in
this
world
nor
in
the
next
man
must
learn
to
rely
upon
himself
reading
bibles
will
not
protect
him
from
the
blasts
of
winter
but
houses
fires
and
clothing
will
to
prevent
famine
one
plow
is
worth
a
million
sermons
and
even
patent
medicines
will
cure
more
diseases
than
all
the
prayers
uttered
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
although
many
eminent
men
have
endeavored
to
harmonize
necessity
and
free
will
the
existence
of
evil
and
the
infinite
power
and
goodness
of
god
they
have
succeeded
only
in
producing
learned
and
ingenious
failures
immense
efforts
have
been
made
to
reconcile
ideas
utterly
inconsistent
with
the
facts
by
which
we
are
surrounded
and
all
persons
who
have
failed
to
perceive
the
pretended
reconciliation
have
been
denounced
as
infidels
atheists
and
scoffers
the
whole
power
of
the
church
has
been
brought
to
bear
against
philosophers
and
scientists
in
order
to
compel
a
denial
of
the
authority
of
demonstration
and
to
induce
some
judas
to
betray
reason
one
of
the
saviors
of
mankind
during
that
frightful
period
known
as
the
dark
ages
faith
reigned
with
scarcely
rebellious
subject
her
temples
were
carpeted
with
knees
and
the
wealth
of
nations
adorned
her
countless
shrines
the
great
painters
prostituted
their
genius
to
immortalize
her
vagaries
while
the
poets
enshrined
them
in
song
at
her
bidding
man
covered
the
earth
with
blood
the
scales
of
justice
were
turned
with
gold
and
for
her
use
were
invented
all
the
cunning
instruments
of
pain
she
built
cathedrals
for
god
and
dungeons
for
men
she
peopled
the
clouds
with
angels
and
the
earth
with
slaves
for
centuries
the
world
was
retracing
its
steps
going
steadily
back
toward
barbaric
night
a
few
infidels
a
few
heretics
cried
halt
to
the
great
rabble
of
ignorant
devotion
and
made
it
possible
for
the
genius
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
revolutionize
the
cruel
creeds
and
superstitions
of
mankind
the
thoughts
of
man
in
order
to
be
of
any
real
worth
must
be
free
under
the
influence
of
fear
the
brain
is
paralyzed
and
instead
of
bravely
solving
a
problem
for
itself
tremblingly
adopts
the
solution
of
another
as
long
as
a
majority
of
men
will
cringe
to
the
very
earth
before
some
petty
prince
or
king
what
must
be
the
infinite
abjectness
of
their
little
souls
in
the
presence
of
their
supposed
creator
and
god
under
such
circumstances
what
can
their
thoughts
be
worth
the
originality
of
repetition
and
the
mental
vigor
of
acquiescence
are
all
that
we
have
any
right
to
expect
from
the
christian
world
as
long
as
every
question
is
answered
by
the
word
god
scientific
inquiry
is
simply
impossible
as
fast
as
phenomena
are
satisfactorily
explained
the
domain
of
the
power
supposed
to
be
superior
to
nature
must
decrease
while
the
horizon
of
the
known
must
as
constantly
continue
to
enlarge
it
is
no
longer
satisfactory
to
account
for
the
fall
and
rise
of
nations
by
saying
it
is
the
will
of
god
such
an
explanation
puts
ignorance
and
education
upon
exact
equality
and
does
away
with
the
idea
of
really
accounting
for
anything
whatever
will
the
religionist
pretend
that
the
real
end
of
science
is
to
ascertain
how
and
why
god
acts
science
from
such
a
standpoint
would
consist
in
investigating
the
law
of
arbitrary
action
and
in
a
grand
endeavor
to
ascertain
the
rule
necessarily
obeyed
by
infinite
caprice
from
a
philosophical
point
of
view
science
is
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
life
of
the
condition
of
happiness
of
the
facts
by
which
we
are
surrounded
and
the
relations
we
sustain
to
men
and
things
by
means
of
which
man
so
to
speak
subjugates
nature
and
bends
the
elemental
powers
to
his
will
making
blind
force
the
servant
of
his
brain
a
belief
in
special
providence
does
away
with
the
spirit
of
investigation
and
is
inconsistent
with
personal
efforts
why
should
man
endeavor
to
thwart
the
designs
of
god
which
of
you
with
taking
thought
can
add
to
his
stature
one
cubit
under
the
influence
of
this
belief
man
basking
in
the
sunshine
of
a
delusion
considers
the
lilies
of
the
field
and
refuses
to
take
any
thought
for
the
morrow
believing
himself
in
the
power
of
an
infinite
being
who
can
at
any
moment
dash
him
to
the
lowest
hell
or
raise
him
to
the
highest
heaven
he
necessarily
abandons
the
idea
of
accomplishing
anything
by
his
own
efforts
so
long
as
this
belief
was
general
the
world
was
filled
with
ignorance
superstition
and
misery
the
energies
of
man
were
wasted
in
a
vain
effort
to
obtain
the
aid
of
this
power
supposed
to
be
superior
to
nature
for
countless
ages
even
men
were
sacrificed
upon
the
altar
of
this
impossible
god
to
please
him
mothers
have
shed
the
blood
of
their
own
babies
martyrs
have
chanted
triumphant
songs
in
the
midst
of
flames

have
gorged
themselves
with

ecstasies
of

every

has
been
endured
and
every
horror
has
been
perpetrated
through
the
dim
long
years
that
have
fled
humanity
has
suffered
more
than
can
be
conceived
most
of
the
misery
has
been
endured
by
the
weak
the
loving
and
the
innocent
women
have
been
treated
like
poisonous
beasts

been
vermin
numberless
altars
have
been
reddened
even
with

blood
of

have
been
given
to
slimy
serpents
whole
races
of
men
doomed
to
centuries
of
slavery
everywhere
there
has
been
outrage
beyond
the
power
of
genius
to
express
during
all
these
years
the
suffering
have
supplicated
the
withered
lips
of
famine
have
prayed
the
pale
victims
have
implored
and
heaven
has
been
deaf
and
blind
of
what
use
have
the
gods
been
to
man
it
is
no
answer
to
say
that
some
god
created
the
world
established
certain
laws
and
then
turned
his
attention
to
other
matters
leaving
his
children
weak
ignorant
and
unaided
to
fight
the
battle
of
life
alone
it
is
no
solution
to
declare
that
in
some
other
world
this
god
will
render
a
few
or
even
all
of
his
subjects
happy
what
right
have
we
to
expect
that
a
perfectly
wise
good
and
powerful
being
will
ever
do
better
than
he
has
done
and
is
doing
the
world
is
filled
with
imperfections
if
it
was
made
by
an
infinite
being
what
reason
have
we
for
saying
that
he
will
render
it
nearer
perfect
than
it
now
is
if
the
infinite
father
allows
a
majority
of
his
children
to
live
in
ignorance
and
wretchedness
now
what
evidence
is
there
that
he
will
ever
improve
their
condition
will
god
have
more
power
will
he
become
more
merciful
will
his
love
for
his
poor
creatures
increase
can
the
conduct
of
infinite
wisdom
power
and
love
ever
change
is
the
infinite
capable
of
any
improvement
whatever
we
are
informed
by
the
clergy
that
this
world
is
a
kind
of
school
that
the
evils
by
which
we
are
surrounded
are
for
the
purpose
of
developing
our
souls
and
that
only
by
suffering
can
men
become
pure
strong
virtuous
and
grand
supposing
this
to
be
true
what
is
to
become
of
those
who
die
in
infancy
the
little
children
according
to
this
philosophy
can
never
be
developed
they
were
so
unfortunate
as
to
escape
the
ennobling
influences
of
pain
and
misery
and
as
a
consequence
are
doomed
to
an
eternity
of
mental
inferiority
if
the
clergy
are
right
on
this
question
none
are
so
unfortunate
as
the
happy
and
we
should
envy
only
the
suffering
and
distressed
if
evil
is
necessary
to
the
development
of
man
in
this
life
how
is
it
possible
for
the
soul
to
improve
in
the
perfect
joy
of
paradise
since
paley
found
his
watch
the
argument
of
design
has
been
relied
upon
as
unanswerable
the
church
teaches
that
this
world
and
all
that
it
contains
were
created
substantially
as
we
now
see
them
that
the
grasses
the
flowers
the
trees
and
all
animals
including
man
were
special
creations
and
that
they
sustain
no
necessary
relation
to
each
other
the
most
orthodox
will
admit
that
some
earth
has
been
washed
into
the
sea
that
the
sea
has
encroached
a
little
upon
the
land
and
that
some
mountains
may
be
a
trifle
lower
than
in
the
morning
of
creation
the
theory
of
gradual
development
was
unknown
to
our
fathers
the
idea
of
evolution
did
not
occur
to
them
our
fathers
looked
upon
the
then
arrangement
of
things
as
the
primal
arrangement
the
earth
appeared
to
them
fresh
from
the
hands
of
a
deity
they
knew
nothing
of
the
slow
evolutions
of
countless
years
but
supposed
that
the
almost
infinite
variety
of
vegetable
and
animal
forms
had
existed
from
the
first
suppose
that
upon
some
island
we
should
find
a
man
a
million
years
of
age
and
suppose
that
we
should
find
him
in
the
possession
of
a
most
beautiful
carriage
constructed
upon
the
most
perfect
model
and
suppose
further
that
he
should
tell
us
that
it
was
the
result
of
several
hundred
thousand
years
of
labor
and
of
thought
that
for
fifty
thousand
years
he
used
as
flat
a
log
as
he
could
find
before
it
occurred
to
him
that
by
splitting
the
log
he
could
have
the
same
surface
with
only
half
the
weight
that
it
took
him
many
thousand
years
to
invent
wheels
for
this
log
that
the
wheels
he
first
used
were
solid
and
that
fifty
thousand
years
of
thought
suggested
the
use
of
spokes
and
tire
that
for
many
centuries
he
used
the
wheels
without
that
it
took
a
hundred
thousand
years
more
to
think
of
using
four
wheels
instead
of
two
that
for
ages
he
walked
behind
the
carriage
when
going
down
hill
in
order
to
hold
it
back
and
that
only
by
a
lucky
chance
he
invented
the
tongue
would
we
conclude
that
this
man
from
the
very
first
had
been
an
infinitely
ingenious
and
perfect
mechanic
suppose
we
found
him
living
in
an
elegant
mansion
and
he
should
inform
us
that
he
lived
in
that
house
for
five
hundred
thousand
years
before
he
thought
of
putting
on
a
roof
and
that
he
had
but
recently
invented
windows
and
doors
would
we
say
that
from
the
beginning
he
had
been
an
infinite
accomplished
and
scientific
architect
does
not
an
improvement
in
the
things
created
show
the
corresponding
improvement
in
the
creator
would
an
infinitely
wise
good
and
powerful
god
intending
to
produce
man
commence
with
the
lowest
possible
forms
of
life
with
the
simplest
organism
that
can
be
imagined
and
during
immeasurable
periods
of
time
slowly
and
almost
imperceptibly
improve
upon
the
rude
beginning
until
man
was
evolved
would
countless
ages
thus
be
wasted
in
the
production
of
awkward
forms
afterward
abandoned
can
the
intelligence
of
man
discover
the
least
wisdom
in
covering
the
earth
with
crawling
creeping
horrors
that
live
only
upon
the
agonies
and
pangs
of
others
can
we
see
the
propriety
of
so
constructing
the
earth
that
only
an
insignificant
portion
of
its
surface
is
capable
of
producing
an
intelligent
man
who
can
appreciate
the
mercy
of
so
making
the
world
that
all
animals
devour
animals
so
that
every
mouth
is
a
and
every
stomach
a
tomb
is
it
possible
to
discover
infinite
intelligence
and
love
in
universal
and
eternal
carnage
what
would
we
think
of
a
father
who
should
give
a
farm
to
his
children
and
before
giving
them
possession
should
plant
upon
it
thousands
of
deadly
shrubs
and
vines
should
stock
it
with
ferocious
beasts
and
poisonous
reptiles
should
take
pains
to
put
a
few
swamps
in
the
neighborhood
to
breed
malaria
should
so
arrange
matters
that
the
ground
would
occasionally
open
and
swallow
a
few
of
his
darlings
and
besides
all
this
should
establish
a
few
volcanoes
in
the
immediate
vicinity
that
might
at
any
moment
overwhelm
his
children
with
rivers
of
fire
suppose
that
this
father
neglected
to
tell
his
children
which
of
the
plants
were
deadly
that
the
reptiles
were
poisonous
failed
to
say
anything
about
the
earthquakes
and
kept
the
volcano
business
a
profound
secret
would
we
pronounce
him
angel
or
fiend
and
yet
this
is
exactly
what
the
orthodox
god
has
done
according
to
the
theologians
god
prepared
this
globe
expressly
for
the
habitation
of
his
loved
children
and
yet
he
filled
the
forests
with
ferocious
beasts
placed
serpents
in
every
path
stuffed
the
world
with
earthquakes
and
adorned
its
surface
with
mountains
of
flame
notwithstanding
all
this
we
are
told
that
the
world
is
perfect
that
it
was
created
by
a
perfect
being
and
is
therefore
necessarily
perfect
the
next
moment
these
same
persons
will
tell
us
that
the
world
was
cursed
covered
with
brambles
thistles
and
thorns
and
that
man
was
doomed
to
disease
and
death
simply
because
our
poor
dear
mother
ate
an
apple
contrary
to
the
command
of
an
arbitrary
god
a
very
pious
friend
of
mine
having
heard
that
i
had
said
the
world
was
full
of
imperfections
asked
me
if
the
report
was
true
upon
being
informed
that
it
was
he
expressed
great
surprise
that
any
one
could
be
guilty
of
such
presumption
he
said
that
in
his
judgment
it
was
impossible
to
point
out
an
imperfection
be
kind
enough
said
he
to
name
even
one
improvement
that
you
could
make
if
you
had
the
power
well
said
i
i
would
make
good
health
catching
instead
of
disease
the
truth
is
it
is
impossible
to
harmonize
all
the
ills
and
pains
and
agonies
of
this
world
with
the
idea
that
we
were
created
by
and
are
watched
over
and
protected
by
an
infinitely
wise
powerful
and
beneficent
god
who
is
superior
to
and
independent
of
nature
the
clergy
however
balance
all
the
real
ills
of
this
life
with
the
expected
joys
of
the
next
we
are
assured
that
all
is
perfection
in
heaven
there
the
skies
are
cloudless
there
all
is
serenity
and
peace
here
empires
may
be
overthrown
dynasties
may
be
extinguished
in
blood
millions
of
slaves
may
toil
the
fierce
rays
of
the
sun
and
the
cruel
strokes
of
the
lash
yet
all
is
happiness
in
heaven
pestilence
may
strew
the
earth
with
corpses
of
the
loved
the
survivors
may
bend
above
them
in
agony
yet
the
placid
bosom
of
heaven
is
unruffled
children
may
expire
vainly
asking
for
bread
babies
may
be
devoured
by
serpents
while
the
gods
sit
smiling
in
the
clouds
the
innocent
may
languish
unto
death
in
the
obscurity
of
dungeons
brave
men
and
heroic
women
may
be
changed
to
ashes
at
the
bigot
stake
while
heaven
is
filled
with
song
and
joy
out
on
the
wide
sea
in
darkness
and
in
storm
the
shipwrecked
struggle
with
the
cruel
waves
while
the
angels
play
upon
their
golden
harps
the
streets
of
the
world
are
filled
with
the
diseased
the
deformed
and
the
helpless
the
chambers
of
pain
are
crowded
with
the
pale
forms
of
the
suffering
while
the
angels
float
and
fly
in
the
happy
realms
of
day
in
heaven
they
are
too
happy
to
have
sympathy
too
busy
singing
to
aid
the
imploring
and
distressed
their
eyes
are
blinded
their
ears
are
stopped
and
their
hearts
are
turned
to
stone
by
the
infinite
selfishness
of
joy
the
saved
mariner
is
too
happy
when
he
touches
the
shore
to
give
a
moment
thought
to
his
drowning
brothers
with
the
indifference
of
happiness
with
the
contempt
of
bliss
heaven
barely
glances
at
the
miseries
of
earth
cities
are
devoured
by
the
rushing
lava
the
earth
opens
and
thousands
perish
women
raise
their
clasped
hands
towards
heaven
but
the
gods
are
too
happy
to
aid
their
children
the
smiles
of
the
deities
are
unacquainted
with
the
tears
of
men
the
shouts
of
heaven
drown
the
sobs
of
earth
having
shown
how
man
created
gods
and
how
he
became
the
trembling
slave
of
his
own
creation
the
questions
naturally
arise
how
did
he
free
himself
even
a
little
from
these
monarchs
of
the
sky
from
these
despots
of
the
clouds
from
this
aristocracy
of
the
air
how
did
he
even
to
the
extent
that
he
has
outgrow
his
ignorant
abject
terror
and
throw
off
the
yoke
of
superstition
probably
the
first
thing
that
tended
to
disabuse
his
mind
was
the
discovery
of
order
of
regularity
of
periodicity
in
the
universe
from
this
he
began
to
suspect
that
everything
did
not
happen
purely
with
reference
to
him
he
noticed
that
whatever
he
might
do
the
motions
of
the
planets
were
always
the
same
that
eclipses
were
periodical
and
that
even
comets
came
at
certain
intervals
this
convinced
him
that
eclipses
and
comets
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
and
that
his
conduct
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
he
perceived
that
they
were
not
caused
for
his
benefit
or
injury
he
thus
learned
to
regard
them
with
admiration
instead
of
fear
he
began
to
suspect
that
famine
was
not
sent
by
some
enraged
and
revengeful
deity
but
resulted
often
from
the
neglect
and
ignorance
of
man
he
learned
that
diseases
were
not
produced
by
evil
spirits
he
found
that
sickness
was
occasioned
by
natural
causes
and
would
be
cured
by
natural
means
he
demonstrated
to
his
own
satisfaction
at
least
that
prayer
is
not
a
medicine
he
found
by
sad
experience
that
his
gods
were
of
no
practical
use
as
they
never
assisted
him
except
when
he
was
perfectly
able
to
help
himself
at
last
he
began
to
discover
that
his
individual
action
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
strange
appearances
in
the
heavens
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
be
bad
enough
to
cause
a
whirlwind
or
good
enough
to
stop
one
after
many
centuries
of
thought
he
about
half
concluded
that
making
mouths
at
a
priest
would
not
necessarily
cause
an
earthquake
he
noticed
and
no
doubt
with
considerable
astonishment
that
very
good
men
were
occasionally
struck
by
lightning
while
very
bad
ones
escaped
he
was
frequently
forced
to
the
painful
conclusion
and
it
is
the
most
painful
to
which
any
human
being
ever
was
forced
that
the
right
did
not
always
prevail
he
noticed
that
the
gods
did
not
interfere
in
behalf
of
the
weak
and
innocent
he
was
now
and
then
astonished
by
seeing
an
unbeliever
in
the
enjoyment
of
most
excellent
health
he
finally
ascertained
that
there
could
be
no
possible
connection
between
an
unusually
severe
winter
and
his
failure
to
give
sheep
to
a
priest
he
began
to
suspect
that
the
order
of
the
universe
was
not
constantly
being
changed
to
assist
him
because
he
repeated
a
creed
he
observed
that
some
children
would
steal
after
having
been
regularly
baptized
he
noticed
a
vast
difference
between
religions
and
justice
and
that
the
worshipers
of
the
same
god
took
delight
in
cutting
each
other
throats
he
saw
that
these
religious
disputes
filled
the
world
with
hatred
and
slavery
at
last
he
had
the
courage
to
suspect
that
no
god
at
any
time
interferes
with
the
order
of
events
he
learned
a
few
facts
and
these
facts
positively
refused
to
harmonize
with
the
ignorant
superstitions
of
his
fathers
finding
his
sacred
books
incorrect
and
false
in
some
particulars
his
faith
in
their
authenticity
began
to
be
shaken
finding
his
priests
ignorant
on
some
points
he
began
to
lose
respect
for
the
cloth
this
was
the
commencement
of
intellectual
freedom
the
civilization
of
man
has
increased
just
to
the
same
extent
that
religious
power
has
decreased
the
intellectual
advancement
of
man
depends
upon
how
often
he
can
exchange
an
old
superstition
for
a
new
truth
the
church
never
enabled
a
human
being
to
make
even
one
of
these
exchanges
on
the
contrary
all
her
power
has
been
used
to
prevent
them
in
spite
however
of
the
church
man
found
that
some
of
his
religious
conceptions
were
wrong
by
reading
his
bible
he
found
that
the
ideas
of
his
god
were
more
cruel
and
brutal
than
those
of
the
most
depraved
savage
he
also
discovered
that
this
holy
book
was
filled
with
ignorance
and
that
it
must
have
been
written
by
persons
wholly
unacquainted
with
the
nature
of
the
phenomena
by
which
we
are
surrounded
and
now
and
then
some
man
had
the
goodness
and
courage
to
speak
his
honest
thoughts
in
every
age
some
thinker
some
doubter
some
investigator
some
hater
of
hypocrisy
some
despiser
of
sham
some
brave
lover
of
the
right
has
gladly
proudly
and
heroically
braved
the
ignorant
fury
of
superstition
for
the
sake
of
man
and
truth
these
divine
men
were
generally
torn
in
pieces
by
the
worshipers
of
the
gods
socrates
was
poisoned
because
he
lacked
reverence
for
some
of
the
deities
christ
was
crucified
by
the
religious
rabble
for
the
crime
of
blasphemy
nothing
is
more
gratifying
to
a
religionist
than
to
destroy
his
enemies
at
the
command
of
god
religious
persecution
springs
from
a
due
admixture
of
love
towards
god
and
hatred
towards
man
the
terrible
religious
wars
that
inundated
the
world
with
blood
tended
at
least
to
bring
all
religion
into
disgrace
and
hatred
thoughtful
people
began
to
question
the
divine
origin
of
a
religion
that
made
its
believers
hold
the
rights
of
others
in
absolute
contempt
a
few
began
to
compare
christianity
with
the
religions
of
heathen
people
and
were
forced
to
admit
that
the
difference
was
hardly
worth
dying
for
they
also
found
that
other
nations
were
even
happier
and
more
prosperous
than
their
own
they
began
to
suspect
that
their
religion
after
all
was
not
of
much
real
value
for
three
hundred
years
the
christian
world
endeavored
to
rescue
from
the
infidel
the
empty
sepulchre
of
christ
for
three
hundred
years
the
armies
of
the
cross
were
baffled
and
beaten
by
the
victorious
hosts
of
an
impudent
impostor
this
immense
fact
sowed
the
seeds
of
distrust
throughout
all
christendom
and
millions
began
to
lose
confidence
in
a
god
who
had
been
vanquished
by
mohammed
the
people
also
found
that
commerce
made
friends
where
religion
made
enemies
and
that
religious
zeal
was
utterly
incompatible
with
peace
between
nations
or
individuals
the
discovered
that
those
who
loved
the
gods
most
were
apt
to
love
men
least
that
the
arrogance
of
universal
forgiveness
was
amazing
that
the
most
malicious
had
the
effrontery
to
pray
for
their
enemies
and
that
humility
and
tyranny
were
the
fruit
of
the
same
tree
for
ages
a
deadly
conflict
has
been
waged
between
a
few
brave
men
and
women
of
thought
and
genius
upon
the
one
side
and
the
great
ignorant
religious
mass
on
the
other
this
is
the
war
between
science
and
faith
the
few
have
appealed
to
reason
to
honor
to
law
to
freedom
to
the
known
and
to
happiness
here
in
this
world
the
many
have
appealed
to
prejudice
to
fear
to
miracle
to
slavery
to
the
unknown
and
to
misery
hereafter
the
few
have
said
think
the
many
have
said
believe
the
first
doubt
was
the
womb
and
cradle
of
progress
and
from
the
first
doubt
man
has
continued
to
advance
men
began
to
investigate
and
the
church
began
to
oppose
the
astronomer
scanned
the
heavens
while
the
church
branded
his
grand
forehead
with
the
word
infidel
and
now
not
a
glittering
star
in
all
the
vast
expanse
bears
a
christian
name
in
spite
of
all
religion
the
geologist
penetrated
the
earth
read
her
history
in
books
of
stone
and
found
hidden
within
her
bosom
souvenirs
of
all
the
ages
old
ideas
perished
in
the
retort
of
the
chemist
useful
truths
took
their
places
one
by
one
religious
conceptions
have
been
placed
in
the
crucible
of
science
and
thus
far
nothing
but
dross
has
been
found
a
new
world
has
been
discovered
by
the
microscope
everywhere
has
been
found
the
infinite
in
every
direction
man
has
investigated
and
explored
and
nowhere
in
earth
or
stars
has
been
found
the
footstep
of
any
being
superior
to
or
independent
of
nature
nowhere
has
been
discovered
the
slightest
evidence
of
any
interference
from
without
these
are
the
sublime
truths
that
enable
man
to
throw
off
the
yoke
of
superstition
these
are
the
splendid
facts
that
snatched
the
sceptre
of
authority

remains
the

but

nations
like

religions
are
the

the
same
inexorable
destiny
awaits
them
all
the

created
by
the

must
perish
with

they

they

and

is
no

from
the
sneer
of

than
others
have
been

brahma
sat

throne
when
the
scepter
passed

isis
and
osiris
received
the
homage
of

greece
with
her
fierce
valor
swept

and
zeus
put

the

the
earth
trembled
with
the
tread
of

intrepid
sons
and
jove
grasped
with
mailed
hand
the
thunderbolts
of

rome
fell
and
christians
from
her
territory
with
the
red
sword
of
war
carved
out
the
ruling
nations
of
the
world
and
now
christ
sits
upon
the
old
throne
who
will
be
his
successor
day
by
day
religious
conceptions
grow
less
and
less
intense
day
by
day
the
old
spirit
dies
out
of
book
and
creed
the
burning
enthusiasm
the
quenchless
zeal
of
the
early
church
have
gone
never
never
to
return
the
ceremonies
remain
but
the
ancient
faith
is
fading
out
of
the
human
heart
the
worn
out
arguments
fail
to
convince
and
denunciations
that
once
blanched
the
faces
of
a
race
excite
in
us
only
derision
and
disgust
as
time
rolls
on
the
miracles
grow
mean
and
small
and
the
evidences
our
fathers
thought
conclusive
utterly
fail
to
satisfy
us
there
is
an
irrepressible
conflict
between
religion
and
science
and
they
can
not
peaceably
occupy
the
same
brain
nor
the
same
world
while
utterly
discarding
all
creeds
and
denying
the
truth
of
all
religions
there
is
neither
in
my
heart
nor
upon
my
lips
a
sneer
for
the
hopeful
loving
and
tender
souls
who
believe
that
from
all
this
discord
will
result
a
perfect
harmony
that
every
evil
will
in
some
mysterious
way
become
a
good
and
that
above
and
over
all
there
is
a
being
who
in
some
way
will
reclaim
and
glorify
everyone
of
the
children
of
men
but
for
those
who
heartlessly
try
to
prove
that
salvation
is
almost
impossible
that
damnation
is
almost
certain
that
the
highway
of
the
universe
leads
to
hell
who
fill
life
with
fear
and
death
with
horror
who
curse
the
cradle
and
mock
the
tomb
it
is
impossible
to
entertain
other
than
feelings
of
pity
contempt
and
scorn
reason
observation
and
experience
the
holy
trinity
of
science
have
taught
us
that
happiness
is
the
only
good
that
the
time
to
be
happy
is
now
and
the
way
to
be
happy
is
to
make
others
so
this
is
enough
for
us
in
this
belief
we
are
content
to
live
and
die
if
by
any
possibility
the
existence
of
a
power
superior
to
and
independent
of
nature
shall
be
demonstrated
there
will
then
be
time
enough
to
kneel
until
then
let
us
stand
erect
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
infidels
in
all
ages
have
battled
for
the
rights
of
man
and
have
at
all
times
been
the
fearless
advocates
of
liberty
and
justice
we
are
constantly
charged
by
the
church
with
tearing
down
without
building
again
the
church
should
by
this
time
know
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
rob
men
of
their
opinions
the
history
of
religious
persecutions
fully
establishes
the
fact
that
the
mind
necessarily
resists
and
defies
every
attempt
to
control
it
by
violence
the
mind
necessarily
clings
to
old
ideas
until
prepared
for
the
new
the
moment
we
comprehend
the
truth
all
erroneous
ideas
are
of
necessity
cast
aside
a
surgeon
once
called
upon
a
poor
cripple
and
kindly
offered
to
render
him
any
assistance
in
his
power
the
surgeon
began
to
discourse
very
learnedly
upon
the
nature
and
origin
of
disease
of
the
curative
properties
of
certain
medicines
of
the
advantages
of
exercise
air
and
light
and
of
the
various
ways
in
which
health
and
strength
could
be
restored
these
remarks
were
so
full
of
good
sense
and
discovered
so
much
profound
thought
and
accurate
knowledge
that
the
cripple
becoming
thoroughly
alarmed
cried
out
do
not
i
pray
you
take
away
my
crutches
they
are
my
only
support
and
without
them
i
should
be
miserable
indeed
i
am
not
going
said
the
surgeon
to
take
away
your
crutches
i
am
going
to
cure
you
and
then
you
will
throw
the
crutches
away
yourself
for
the
vagaries
of
the
clouds
the
infidels
propose
to
substitute
the
realities
of
the
earth
for
superstition
the
splendid
demonstrations
and
achievements
of
science
and
for
the
theological
tyranny
the
chainless
liberty
of
thought
we
do
not
say
we
have
discovered
all
that
our
doctrines
are
the
all
in
all
in
truth
we
know
of
no
end
to
the
development
of
man
we
can
not
unravel
the
infinite
complications
of
matter
and
force
the
history
of
one
monad
is
as
unknown
as
that
of
the
universe
one
drop
of
water
is
as
wonderful
as
all
the
seas
one
leaf
as
all
the
forests
and
one
grain
of
sand
as
all
the
stars
we
are
not
endeavoring
to
chain
the
future
but
to
free
the
present
we
are
not
forgoing
fetters
for
our
children
but
we
are
breaking
those
our
fathers
made
for
us
we
are
the
advocates
of
inquiry
of
investigation
and
thought
this
of
itself
is
an
admission
that
we
are
not
perfectly
satisfied
with
all
our
conclusions
philosophy
has
not
the
egotism
of
faith
while
superstition
builds
walls
and
creates
obstructions
science
opens
all
the
highways
of
thought
we
do
not
pretend
to
have
circumnavigated
everything
and
to
have
solved
all
difficulties
but
we
do
believe
that
it
is
better
to
love
men
than
to
fear
gods
that
it
is
grander
and
nobler
to
think
and
investigate
for
yourself
than
to
repeat
a
creed
we
are
satisfied
that
there
can
be
but
little
liberty
on
earth
while
men
worship
a
tyrant
in
heaven
we
do
not
expect
to
accomplish
everything
in
our
day
but
we
want
to
do
what
good
we
can
and
to
render
all
the
service
possible
in
the
holy
cause
of
human
progress
we
know
that
doing
away
with
gods
and
supernatural
persons
and
powers
is
not
an
end
it
is
a
means
to
an
end
the
real
end
being
the
happiness
of
man
felling
forests
is
not
the
end
of
agriculture
driving
pirates
from
the
sea
is
not
all
there
is
of
commerce
we
are
laying
the
foundations
of
a
grand
temple
of
the
future
not
the
temple
of
all
the
gods
but
of
all
the
people
wherein
with
appropriate
rites
will
be
celebrated
the
religion
of
humanity
we
are
doing
what
little
we
can
to
hasten
the
coming
of
the
day
when
society
shall
cease
producing
millionaires
and
mendicants
gorged
indolence
and
famished
industry
truth
in
rags
and
superstition
robed
and
crowned
we
are
looking
for
the
time
when
the
useful
shall
be
the
honorable
and
when
reason
throned
upon
the
world
brain
shall
be
the
king
of
kings
and
god
of
gods
ingersoll
lecture
on
ghosts
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
first
place
allow
me
to
tender
my
sincere
thanks
to
the
clergy
of
this
city
i
feel
that
i
am
greatly
indebted
to
them
for
this
magnificent
audience
it
has
been
said
and
i
believe
it
myself
that
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
intolerance
in
the
church
of
today
but
when
clergymen
three
of
whom
i
believe
are
bishops
act
as
my
advance
agents
without
expecting
any
remuneration
or
reward
in
this
world
i
must
admit
that
perhaps
i
was
mistaken
on
the
question
of
intolerance
and
i
will
say
further
that
against
those
men
i
have
not
the
slightest
feeling
in
the
world
every
man
is
the
product
of
his
own
surroundings
he
is
the
product
of
every
circumstance
that
has
ever
touched
him
he
is
the
product
to
a
certain
degree
of
the
religion
and
creed
of
his
day
and
when
men
show
the
slightest
intolerance
i
blame
the
creed
i
blame
the
religion
i
blame
the
superstition
that
forced
them
to
do
so
i
do
not
blame
those
men
allow
me
to
say
further
that
this
world
is
not
in
my
judgment
yet
perfect
i
am
doing
in
a
very
feeble
way
to
be
sure
but
i
am
still
endeavoring
according
to
my
idea
to
make
this
world
just
a
little
better
to
give
a
little
more
liberty
to
men
a
little
more
liberty
to
women
i
believe
in
the
government
of
kindness
i
believe
in
truth
in
investigation
in
free
thought
i
do
not
believe
that
the
hand
of
want
will
be
eternally
extended
in
the
world
i
do
not
believe
that
the
prison
will
forever
scar
the
ground
i
do
not
believe
that
the
shadow
of
the
gallows
will
forever
curse
the
earth
i
do
not
believe
that
it
will
always
be
true
that
the
men
who
do
the
most
work
will
have
the
least
to
wear
and
the
least
to
eat
i
do
believe
that
the
time
will
come
when
liberty
and
morality
and
justice
like
the
rings
of
saturn
will
surround
the
world
that
the
world
will
be
better
and
every
true
man
and
every
free
man
will
do
what
he
can
to
hasten
the
coming
of
the
religion
of
human
advancement
i
understand
that
for
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
years
that
have
gone
by
all
questions
have
been
settled
by
religion
i
understand
that
during
all
this
time
the
people
have
gotten
their
information
from
the
sacerdotal
class
from
priests
i
know
that
when
india
was
supreme
they
worshipped
brahma
and
vishnu
and
that
when
rome
held
in
its
hand
the
red
sword
of
war
they
worshipped
jove
and
i
know
now
that
our
religion
has
swept
to
the
top
any
man
living
in
india
a
few
hundred
or
thousand
years
ago
would
have
said
this
is
the
only
true
religion
why
because
here
is
the
only
true
civilization
a
man
afterward
living
in
egypt
would
have
said
this
is
the
only
true
religion
because
we
have
the
best
civilization
a
greek
in
athens
would
have
said
this
is
the
only
true
religion
and
a
roman
would
have
said
we
have
the
true
religion
and
now
those
religions
all
having
died
although
they
were
all
true
religions
we
say
ours
is
the
only
religion
because
we
are
the
greatest
commercial
nation
in
the
world
there
will
come
other
nations
there
will
come
other
religions
man
has
made
every
religion
in
this
world
in
my
judgment
and
the
religion
has
been
good
or
bad
according
as
the
men
who
made
it
were
good
or
bad
if
they
were
savages
and
barbarians
they
made
a
god
like
the
jehovah
of
the
jews
if
they
were
civilized
if
they
were
kind
and
tender
they
filled
the
heavens
with
kindness
and
love
every
man
makes
his
own
god
show
me
the
god
a
man
worships
and
i
will
tell
you
what
kind
of
a
man
he
is
every
one
makes
his
own
god
every
one
worships
his
own
god
and
if
you
are
a
civilized
man
you
will
have
a
civilized
god
and
we
have
been
civilizing
ours
for
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years
he
is
getting
better
every
day
i
am
going
to
tell
you
tonight
just
exactly
what
i
think
the
other
lecture
i
delivered
here
was
my
conservative
lecture
this
is
my
radical
one
we
even
hear
it
suggested
that
our
religion
our
bible
has
given
us
all
we
have
of
prosperity
and
greatness
and
grandeur
i
deny
it
we
have
become
civilized
in
spite
of
it
and
i
will
show
you
tonight
that
the
obstruction
that
every
science
has
had
is
what
we
have
been
pleased
to
call
our
religion
or
superstition
i
had
a
conversation
with
a
gentleman
once
and
these
gentlemen
are
always
mistaking
something
that
goes
along
with
a
thing
for
the
cause
of
the
thing
and
he
stated
to
me
that
his
particular
religion
was
the
cause
of
all
advancement
i
said
to
him
no
sir
the
causes
of
all
advancement
in
my
judgment
are
plug
hats
and
suspenders
and
i
said
to
him
you
go
to
turkey
where
they
are
and
you
wo
find
a
pair
of
suspenders
or
a
plug
hat
in
all
that
country
you
go
to
russia
and
you
will
find
now
and
then
a
pair
of
suspenders
at
moscow
or
petersburg
you
go
on
down
till
you
strike
austria
and
black
hats
begin
then
you
go
on
to
paris
berlin
and
new
york
and
you
will
find
everybody
wears
suspenders
and
everybody
wears
black
hats
wherever
you
find
education
and
music
there
you
will
find
black
hats
and
suspenders
he
said
that
any
man
who
said
to
him
that
plug
hats
and
suspenders
had
done
more
for
mankind
than
the
bible
and
religion
he
would
not
talk
to
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
are
controlled
today
by
men
who
do
not
exist
we
are
controlled
today
by
phenomena
that
never
did
exist
we
are
controlled
by
ghosts
and
dead
men
and
in
the
grasp
of
death
is
a
scepter
that
controls
the
living
present
i
propose
that
we
shall
govern
ourselves
i
propose
that
we
shall
let
the
past
go
and
let
the
dead
past
bury
the
dead
past
i
believe
the
american
people
have
brains
enough
and
nerve
enough
and
courage
enough
to
control
and
govern
themselves
without
any
assistance
from
dust
or
ghosts
that
is
my
doctrine
and
i
am
going
to
do
what
i
can
while
i
live
to
increase
that
feeling
of
independence
and
manhood
in
the
american
we
can
control
ourselves
i
believe
in
the
gospel
of
this
world
i
believe
in
happiness
right
here
i
do
not
believe
in
drinking
skim
milk
all
my
life
with
the
expectation
of
butter
beyond
the
clouds
i
believe
in
the
gospel
i
say
in
this
world
this
is
a
mighty
good
world
there
are
plenty
of
good
people
in
this
world
there
is
lots
of
happiness
in
this
world
and
i
say
let
us
in
every
way
we
can
increase
it
i
envy
every
man
who
is
content
with
his
lot
whether
he
is
poor
or
whether
he
is
rich
i
tell
you
the
man
that
tries
to
make
somebody
else
happy
and
who
owns
his
own
soul
nobody
having
a
mortgage
or
deed
of
trust
upon
his
manhood
or
liberty
this
world
is
a
pretty
good
world
for
such
a
man
i
do
not
care
i
am
going
to
say
my
say
whether
i
make
money
or
grow
poor
no
matter
whether
i
get
high
office
or
walk
along
the
dusty
highway
of
the
common
i
am
going
to
say
my
say
and
i
had
rather
be
a
farmer
and
live
on
forty
acres
of
land
live
in
a
log
cabin
that
i
built
myself
and
have
a
little
grassy
path
going
down
to
the
spring
so
that
i
can
go
there
and
hear
the
waters
gurgling
and
know
that
it
is
coming
out
from
the
lips
of
the
earth
like
a
poem
whispering
to
the
white
pebbles
i
would
rather
live
there
and
have
some
hollyhocks
at
the
corner
of
the
house
and
the
larks
singing
and
swinging
in
the
trees
and
some
lattice
over
the
window
so
that
the
sunlight
can
fall
checkered
on
the
babe
in
the
cradle
i
had
rather
live
there
and
have
the
freedom
of
my
own
brain
i
had
rather
do
that
than
live
in
a
palace
of
gold
and
crawl
a
slimy
hypocrite
through
this
world
superstition
has
done
enough
harm
already
every
religion
nearly
suspects
everything
that
is
pleasant
everything
that
is
joyous
and
they
always
have
a
notion
that
god
feels
best
when
we
feel
worst
they
have
chained
the
andromeda
of
joy
to
the
cold
rock
of
ignorance
and
fear
there
to
be
devoured
by
the
dragon
of
superstition
church
and
state
are
two
vultures
that
have
fed
upon
the
heart
of
chained
prometheus
i
say
let
the
human
race
have
a
chance
let
every
man
think
for
himself
and
express
that
thought
there
is
no
wrath
in
the
serene
heavens
there
is
no
scowl
in
the
blue
of
the
sky
upon
the
throne
of
the
universe
tyranny
does
not
sit
as
a
king
the
speaker
here
took
from
his
pocket
a
pair
of
spectacles
and
adjusted
them
saying
i
am
sorry
to
admit
it
i
have
got
to
come
to
it
i
hate
to
put
on
a
pair
of
spectacles
but
the
other
day
as
i
was
putting
them
on
a
thought
struck
me
i
see
progress
in
this
to
progress
is
to
overcome
the
obstacles
of
nature
and
in
order
to
overcome
this
obstacle
of
the
loss
of
sight
man
invented
spectacles
spectacles
led
men
to
the
telescope
with
which
he
read
all
the
starry
heavens
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
failure
of
sight
we
would
have
seen
a
millionth
part
that
we
have
in
the
first
place
we
owe
nothing
but
truth
to
the
dead
i
am
going
to
tell
the
truth
about
them
there
are
three
theories
by
which
men
account
for
all
phenomena
for
everything
that
happens
first
the
supernatural
in
the
olden
time
everything
that
happened
some
deity
produced
some
spirit
some
devil
some
hobgoblin
some
dryad
some
fairy
some
spook
something
except
nature
first
then
the
supernatural
and
a
barbarian
looking
at
the
wide
mysterious
sea
wandering
through
the
depths
of
the
forest
encountering
the
wild
beasts
troubled
by
strange
dreams
accounted
for
everything
by
the
action
of
spirits
good
and
bad
second
the
supernatural
and
natural
there
is
where
the
religious
world
is
today
a
mingling
of
the
supernatural
and
natural
the
idea
being
that
god
created
the
world
and
imposed
upon
men
certain
laws
and
then
let
them
run
and
if
they
ever
got
into
any
trouble
then
he
would
do
a
miracle
and
accomplish
any
good
that
he
desired
to
do
third
and
that
is
the
grand
theory
the
natural
between
these
theories
there
has
been
from
the
dawn
of
civilization
a
conflict
in
this
great
war
nearly
all
the
soldiers
have
been
in
the
ranks
of
the
supernatural
the
believers
in
the
supernatural
insist
that
matter
is
controlled
and
directed
entirely
by
powers
from
without
the
naturalists
maintain
that
nature
acts
from
within
that
nature
is
not
acted
upon
that
the
universe
is
all
there
is
that
nature
with
infinite
arms
embraces
everything
that
exists
and
that
the
supposed
powers
beyond
the
limits
of
the
materially
real
are
simply
ghosts
you
say
ah
this
is
materialism
this
is
the
doctrine
of
matter
what
is
matter
i
take
a
handful
of
earth
in
my
hands
and
into
that
dust
i
put
seeds
and
arrows
from
the
eternal
quiver
of
the
sun
smite
it
and
the
seeds
grow
and
bud
and
blossom
and
fill
the
air
with
perfume
in
my
sight
do
you
understand
that
do
you
understand
how
this
dust
and
these
seeds
and
that
light
and
this
moisture
produced
that
bud
and
that
flower
and
that
perfume
do
you
understand
that
any
better
than
you
do
the
production
of
thought
do
you
understand
that
any
better
than
you
do
a
dream
do
you
understand
that
any
better
than
you
do
the
thoughts
of
love
that
you
see
in
the
eyes
of
the
one
you
adore
can
you
explain
it
can
you
tell
what
matter
is
have
you
the
slightest
conception
yet
you
talk
about
matter
as
though
you
were
acquainted
with
its
origin
as
though
you
had
compelled
with
clenched
hands
the
very
rocks
to
give
up
the
secret
of
existence
do
you
know
what
force
is
can
you
account
for
molecular
action
are
you
familiar
with
chemistry
can
you
account
for
the
loves
and
the
hatreds
of
the
atoms
is
there
not
something
in
matter
that
forever
excludes
you
can
you
tell
what
matter
really
is
before
you

materialism
you

matter
and
the

are
the

yesterday

forever
there
is
just
as
much
matter
in
the
universe
today
as
there
ever
was
and
as
there
ever
will
be
there
is
just
as
much
force
and
just
as
much
energy
as
there
ever
was
or
ever
will
be
but
it
is
continually
taking
different
shapes
and
forms
one
day
it
is
a
man
another
day
it
is
animal
another
day
it
is
earth
another
day
it
is
metal
another
day
it
is
gas
it
gains
nothing
and
it
loses
nothing
our
fathers
denounced
materialism
and
accounted
for
all
phenomena
how
by
the
caprice
of
gods
and
devils
for
thousands
of
years
it
was
believed
that
ghosts
good
ghosts
bad
ghosts
benevolent
and
malevolent
in
some
mysterious
way
produced
all
phenomena
that
disease
and
health
happiness
and
misery
fortune
and
misfortune
peace
and
war
life
and
death
success
and
failure
were
but
arrows
shot
by
those
ghosts
or
shadowy
phantoms
to
reward
or
punish
mankind
that
they
were
displeased
or
pleased
by
our
actions
that
they
blessed
the
earth
with
harvest
or
cursed
it
with
famine
that
they
fed
or
starved
the
children
of
men
that
they
crowned
or
uncrowned
kings
that
they
controlled
war
that
they
gave
prosperous
voyages
allowing
the
brave
mariner
to
meet
his
wife
and
children
inside
the
harbor
bar
or
strewed
the
sad
shore
with
wrecks
of
ships
and
the
bodies
of
men
formerly
these
ghosts
were
believed
to
be
almost
innumerable
earth
air
and
water
were
filled
with
these
phantoms
but
in
modern
times
they
have
greatly
decreased
in
number
because
the
second
proposition
that
i
stated
the
supernatural
and
the
natural
has
generally
been
adopted
but
the
remaining
ghosts
are
supposed
to
perform
the
same
functions
as
of
yore
let
me
say
right
here
that
the
object
of
every
religion
ever
made
by
man
has
been
to
get
on
the
good
side
of
supposed
powers
has
been
to
petition
the
gods
to
stop
the
earthquakes
to
stop
famine
to
stop
pestilence
it
has
always
been
something
that
man
should
do
to
prevent
being
punished
by
the
powers
of
the
air
or
to
get
from
them
some
favors
it
has
always
been
believed
that
these
ghosts
could
in
some
way
be
appeased
that
they
could
be
bettered
by
sacrifices
by
prayer
by
fasting
by
the
building
of
temples
and
cathedrals
by
shedding
the
blood
of
men
and
beasts
by
forms
by
ceremonies
by
kneelings
by
prostrations
and
flagellations
by
living
alone
in
the
wild
desert
by
the
practice
of
celibacy
by
inventing
instruments
of
torture
by
destroying
men
women
and
children
by
covering
the
earth
with
dungeons
by
burning
unbelievers
and
by
putting
chains
upon
the
thoughts
and
manacles
upon
the
lips
of
men
by
believing
things
without
evidence
by
believing
things
against
evidence
by
disbelieving
and
denying
demonstrations
by
despising
facts
by
hating
reason
by
discouraging
investigation
by
making
an
idiot
of
yourself
all
these
have
been
done
to
appease
the
winged
monsters
of
the
air
in
the
history
of
our
poor
world
no
horror
has
been
omitted
no
infamy
has
been
left
undone
by
believers
in
ghosts
and
all
the
shadows
were
born
of
cowardice
and
malignity
they
were
painted
by
the
pencil
of
fear
upon
the
canvas
of
ignorance
by
that
artist
called
superstition
from
these
ghosts
our
fathers
received
their
information
these
ghosts
were
the
schoolmasters
of
our
ancestors
they
were
the
scientists
the
philosophers
the
geologists
the
legislators
the
astronomers
the
physicians
the
metaphysicians
and
historians
of
the
past
let
me
give
you
my
definition
of
metaphysics
that
is
to
say
the
science
of
the
unknown
the
science
of
guessing
metaphysics
is
where
two
fools
get
together
and
each
one
admits
that
neither
can
prove
and
both
say
hence
we
infer
that
is
the
science
of
metaphysics
for
this
these
ghosts
were
supposed
to
have
the
only
experience
and
real
knowledge
they
inspired
men
to
write
books
and
the
books
were
sacred
if
facts
were
found
to
be
inconsistent
with
these
books
so
much
the
worse
for
the
facts
and
especially
for
the
discoverers
of
these
facts
it
was
then
and
still
is
believed
that
these
sacred
books
are
the
basis
of
the
idea
of
immortality
to
give
up
the
idea
that
these
books
were
inspired
is
and
to
renounce
the
idea
of
immortal
life
i
deny
it
men
existed
before
books
and
all
the
books
that
were
ever
written
were
written
in
my
judgment
by
men
and
the
idea
of
immortality
was
not
born
of
a
book
but
was
born
of
the
man
who
wrote
the
book
the
idea
of
immortality
like
the
great
sea
has
ebbed
and
flowed
in
the
human
heart
beating
its
countless
waves
of
hope
and
joy
against
the
shores
of
time
and
was
not
born
of
any
book
nor
of
any
religion
nor
of
any
creed
it
was
born
of
human
affection
and
it
will
continue
to
ebb
and
flow
beneath
the
clouds
and
mists
of
doubt
and
darkness
as
long
as
love
kisses
the
lips
of
death
it
is
the
rainbow
of
hope
shining
upon
the
tears
of
grief
we
love
therefore
we
wish
to
live
and
the
foundation
of
the
idea
of
immortality
is
human
affection
and
human
love
and
i
have
a
thousand
times
more
confidence
in
the
affections
of
the
human
heart
in
the
deep
and
splendid
feelings
of
the
human
soul
than
i
have
in
any
book
that
ever
was
or
ever
can
be
written
by
mortal
man
from
the
books
written
by
those
ghosts
we
have
at
least
ascertained
that
they
knew
nothing
whatever
of
the
world
in
which
we
live
did
they
know
anything
about
any
other
upon
every
point
where
contradiction
is
possible
the
ghosts
have
been
contradicted
by
these
ghosts
by
these
citizens
of
the
air
by
this
aristocracy
of
the
clouds
the
affairs
of
government
were
administered
all
authority
to
govern
came
from
them
the
emperors
kings
and
potentates
every
one
of
them
had
the
divine
petroleum
poured
upon
his
head
the
kerosene
of
authority
the
emperors
king
and
potentates
had
communications
from
the
phantoms
man
was
not
considered
as
the
source
of
power
to
rebel
against
the
king
was
to
rebel
against
the
ghosts
and
nothing
less
than
the
blood
of
the
offenders
could
appease
the
invisible
phantoms
and
by
the
authority
of
the
ghosts
man
was
crushed
and
slayed
and
plundered
many
toiled
wearily
in
the
sun
and
storm
that
a
few
favorites
of
the
ghosts
might
live
in
idleness
and
many
lived
in
huts
and
caves
and
dens
that
the
few
might
dwell
in
palaces
and
many
clothed
themselves
with
rags
that
a
few
might
robe
themselves
in
purple
and
gold
and
many
crept
and
cringed
and
crawled
that
a
few
might
tread
upon
their
necks
with
feet
of
iron
from
the
ghosts
men
received
not
only
authority
but
information
they
told
us
the
form
of
the
earth
they
informed
us
that
eclipses
were
caused
by
the
sins
of
man
especially
the
failure
to
pay
tithes
that
the
universe
was
made
in
six
days
that
gazing
at
the
sky
with
a
telescope
was
dangerous
that
trying
to
be
wise
beyond
what
they
had
written
was
born
of
a
rebellious
and
irreverent
spirit
they
told
us
there
was
no
virtue
like
belief
no
crime
like
doubt
that
investigation
was
simply
impudence
and
the
punishment
therefore
violent
torment
they
not
only
told
us
all
about
this
world
but
about
two
others
and
if
their
statements
about
the
other
two
are
as
true
as
they
were
about
this
no
one
can
estimate
the
value
of
their
information
for
countless
ages
the
world
was
governed
by
ghosts
and
they
spared
no
pains
to
change
the
eagle
of
the
human
intellect
into
a
bat
of
darkness
to
accomplish
this
infamous
purpose
to
drive
the
love
of
truth
from
the
human
heart
to
prevent
the
advancement
of
mankind
to
shut
out
from
the
world
every
ray
of
intellectual
light
to
pollute
every
mind
with
superstition
the
power
of
kings
the
cunning
and
cruelty
of
priests
and
the
wealth
of
nations
were
used
in
order
to
show
you
the
information
we
got
from
the
ghosts
and
the
condition
of
the
world
when
the
ghosts
were
the
kings
let
me
call
your
attention
to
this
during
these
years
of
persecution
ignorance
superstition
and
slavery
nearly
all
the
people
the
kings
lawyers
and
doctors
learned
and
unlearned
believed
in
that
frightful
production
of
ignorance
of
fear
and
faith
called
witchcraft
witchcraft
today
is
religion
carried
out
they
believed
that
man
was
the
sport
and
prey
of
devils
that
the
very
air
was
thick
with
these
enemies
of
man
and
with
few
exceptions
this
hideous
belief
was
universal
under
these
conditions
progress
was
almost
impossible
fear
paralyzed
the
brain
progress
is
born
of
courage
fear
believes
courage
doubts
fear
falls
upon
the
earth
and
prays
courage
stands
erect
and
thinks
fear
retreats
courage
advances
fear
is
barbarism
courage
is
civilization
fear
believes
in
witchcraft
courage
in
science
and
in
eternal
law
the
facts
upon
which
this
terrible
belief
rested
were
proved
over
and
over
again
in
nearly
every
court
in
europe
thousands
confessed
themselves
guilty
admitted
they
had
sold
themselves
to
the
devil
they
gave
the
particulars
of
the
sale
told
what
they
said
and
what
the
devil
replied
they
confessed
themselves
guilty
when
they
knew
that
confession
was
death
knew
that
their
property
would
be
confiscated
and
their
children
left
to
beg
their
bread
this
is
one
of
the
miracles
of
history
one
of
the
strangest
contradictions
of
the
human
mind
without
doubt
they
really
believed
themselves
guilty
in
the
first
place
they
believed
in
witchcraft
as
a
fact
and
when
charged
with
it
they
became
insane
they
had
read
the
account
of
the
witch
of
endor
calling
up
the
dead
body
of
samuel
he
is
an
old
man
he
has
his
mantle
on
they
had
read
the
account
of
saul
stooping
to
the
earth
and
conversing
with
the
spirit
that
had
been
called
from
the
region
of
space
by
a
witch
they
had
read
a
command
from
the
almighty
thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
and
they
believed
the
world
was
full
of
witches
or
else
the
almighty
would
not
have
made
a
law
against
them
they
believed
in
witchcraft
and
when
they
were
charged
with
it
they
probably
became
insane
and
in
their
insanity
they
confessed
their
guilt
they
found
themselves
abhorred
and
deserted
charged
with
a
crime
they
could
not
disprove
like
a
man
in
quicksand
every
effort
only
sunk
them
deeper
caught
in
this
frightful
web
at
the
mercy
of
the
devotees
of
superstition
hope
fled
and
nothing
remained
but
the
insanity
of
confession
the
whole
world
appeared
insane
in
the
time
of
james
i
a
man
was
burned
for
causing
a
storm
at
sea
with
the
intention
of
drowning
one
of
the
royal
family
but
i
do
not
think
it
would
have
been
much
of
a
crime
if
he
had
been
really
guilty
how
could
he
disprove
it
how
could
he
show
that
he
did
not
cause
a
storm
at
sea
all
storms
were
at
that
time
supposed
to
be
inspired
by
the
devil
the
people
believed
that
all
storms
were
caused
by
him
or
by
persons
whom
he
assisted
i
implore
you
to
remember
that
the
men
who
believed
these
things
wrote
our
creeds
and
our
confessions
of
faith
and
it
is
by
their
dust
that
i
am
asked
to
kneel
and
pay
implicit
homage
instead
of
investigating
and
i
implore
you
to
recollect
that
they
wrote
our
creeds
a
woman
was
tried
and
convicted
before
sir
matthew
hale
one
of
the
greatest
judges
and
lawyers
of
england
for
having
caused
children
to
vomit
crooked
pins
think
of
that
the
learned
judge
charged
the
intelligent
jury
that
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
existence
of
witches
that
it
was
established
by
all
history
and
expressly
taught
by
the
bible
the
woman
was
hung
and
her
body
was
burned
sir
thomas
moore
declared
that
to
give
up
witchcraft
was
to
throw
away
the
sacred
scriptures
john
wesley
too
was
a
firm
believer
in
ghosts
and
insisted
upon
their
existence
after
all
laws
upon
the
subject
had
been
repealed
in
england
and
i
beg
of
you
to
remember
that
john
wesley
was
the
founder
of
the
methodist
church
in
new
england
a
woman
was
charged
with
being
a
witch
and
with
having
changed
herself
into
a
fox
while
in
that
condition
she
was
attacked
and
bitten
by
some
dogs
and
a
committee
of
three
men
was
ordered
by
the
court
to
examine
this
woman
they
removed
her
clothing
and
searched
for
what
they
were
pleased
to
call
that
is
to
say
spots
into
which
a
needle
could
be
thrust
without
giving
pain
they
reported
to
the
court
that
such
spots
were
found
she
denied
that
she
had
ever
changed
herself
into
a
fox
on
the
report
of
the
committee
she
was
found
guilty
and
she
was
actually
executed
by
our
puritan
fathers
the
gentlemen
who
braved
the
danger
of
the
deep
for
the
sake
of
worshiping
god
and
persecuting
their
fellow
men
i
belong
to
their
blood
and
the
best
thing
i
can
say
about
them
and
that
which
rises
like
a
white
shaft
to
their
eternal
honor
is
that
they
were
in
favor
of
education
a
man
was
attacked
by
a
wolf
he
defended
himself
and
succeeded
in
cutting
off
one
of
the
animal
paws
and
the
wolf
ran
away
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
carried
it
home
there
he
found
his
wife
with
one
of
her
hands
gone
and
he
took
that
paw
from
his
pocket
and
put
it
upon
her
arm
and
it
assumed
the
appearance
of
a
human
hand
and
he
charged
his
wife
with
being
a
witch
she
was
tried
she
confessed
her
guilt
and
she
was
hung
and
her
body
was
burned
my
is
it
possible
did
not
somebody
say
something
against
such
an
infamous
proceeding
yes
they
did
there
was
a
young
men
association
who
invited
a
man
to
come
and
give
his
ideas
upon
the
subject
he
denounced
it
he
said
it
was
outrageous
that
it
was
nonsensical
that
it
was
infamous
and
the
moment
he
went
away
the
young
men
met
and
passed
a
resolution
that
he
had
deceived
them
and
the
clergy
at
that
time
protested
and
said
of
course
let
the
man
think
if
you
call
that
kind
of
stuff
thinking
but
there
was
one
man
belonging
to
this
association
who
had
the
courage
to
stand
by
the
truth
whether
he
believed
in
what
the
speaker
said
or
not
he
had
that
manliness
and
i
take
this
opportunity
to
thank
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
a
man
i
have
no
idea
he
agrees
with
me
except
in
this
whatever
you
do
do
it
like
a
man
and
be
honest
about
it
people
were
burned
for
causing
frost
in
summer
for
destroying
crops
with
hail
for
causing
storms
for
making
cows
go
dry
for
souring
beer
for
putting
the
devil
in
emptyings
so
that
they
would
not
rise
the
life
of
no
one
was
secure
to
be
charged
was
to
be
convicted
every
man
was
at
the
mercy
of
every
other
this
infamous
belief
was
so
firmly
seated
in
the
minds
of
the
people
that
to
express
a
doubt
as
to
its
existence
was
to
be
suspected
yourself
they
believed
that
animals
were
often
taken
possession
of
by
devils
and
they
believed
that
the
killing
of
the
animal
would
destroy
the
devil
they
absolutely
tried
convicted
and
executed
dumb
beasts
at
vail
in
a
rooster
was
tried
upon
the
charge
of
having
laid
an
egg
and
the
clergy
said
they
had
no
doubt
of
it
rooster
eggs
were
used
only
in
making
this
everybody
knew
the
rooster
was
convicted
and
with
all
due
solemnity
he
was
burned
in
the
public
square
so
a
hog
and
six
pig
died
for
having
killed
and
partially
eaten
a
child
the
hog
was
convicted
but
the
pigs
on
account
of
their
extreme
youth
were
acquitted
as
late
as
a
cow
charged
with
being
possessed
of
a
devil
was
tried
and
was
convicted
they
used
to
exorcise
rats
snakes
and
vermin
they
used
to
go
through
the
alleys
and
streets
and
fields
and
warn
them
to
leave
within
a
certain
number
of
days
and
if
they
did
not
leave
they
threatened
them
with
certain
pains
and
penalties
which
they
proceeded
to
recount
but
let
us
be
careful
how
we
laugh
about
those
things
let
us
not
pride
ourselves
too
much
on
the
progress
of
our
age
we
must
not
forget
that
some
of
our
people
are
yet
in
the
same
intelligent
business
only
a
little
while
ago
the
governor
of
minnesota
appointed
a
day
of
fasting
and
prayer
to
see
if
the
lord
could
not
be
induced
to
kill
the
grasshoppers
or
send
them
into
some
other
state
about
the
close
of
the
fifteenth
century
was
the
excitement
in
regard
to
witchcraft
and
pope
innocent
the
eighth
issued
a
bull
directing
the
inquisitors
to
be
vigilant
in
searching
out
and
punishing
all
guilty
of
this
crime
forms
for
the
crime
were
regularly
issued
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
the
church
was
busy
in
punishing
the
impossible
crime
of
witchcraft
by
burning
hanging
and
torturing
men
women
and
little
children
protestants
were
as
active
as
catholics
and
in
geneva
five
hundred
witches
were
burned
at
the
stake
in
three
months
and
one
thousand
were
executed
in
one
year
in
the
diocese
of
couro
at
least
one
hundred
thousand
victims
suffered
in
germany
the
last
execution
being
in
galesburgh
and
taking
place
in
and
the
last
in
switzerland
in
england
statutes
were
passed
from
henry
vi
to
james
i
defining
the
crime
and
punishment
and
the
last
act
passed
in
the
british
parliament
was
when
lord
bacon
was
a
member
of
the
house
in
hicks
and
daughter
nine
years
of
age
were
hung
for
selling
their
souls
to
the
devil
and
raising
a
storm
at
sea
by
pulling
off
their
stockings
and
making
a
lather
of
soap
in
england
it
has
been
estimated
that
at
least
were
hung
or
burned
the
last
victim
executed
in
scotland
was
she
was
an
innocent
old
woman
who
had
so
little
idea
of
her
condition
that
she
rejoiced
at
the
sight
of
the
fire
destined
to
consume
her
to
ashes
she
had
a
daughter
lame
in
her
hands
a
circumstance
accounted
for
from
the
fact
that
the
witch
had
been
used
to
transfer
her
daughter
into
a
pony
and
get
her
shod
by
the
devil
intelligent
ancestors
in
nineteen
persons
were
executed
in
salem
massachusetts
for
the
crime
of
witchcraft
it
was
thought
in
those
days
that
men
and
women
made
contracts
with
the
devil
and
those
contracts
were
confirmed
at
a
meeting
of
witches
and
ghosts
over
which
the
devil
presided
these
contracts
in
some
cases
were
for
a
few
years
others
for
life
general
assemblages
of
witches
were
held
once
a
year
to
these
they
rode
from
great
distances
on
brooms
and
dogs
and
there
they
did
homage
to
the
prince
of
hell
and
offered
him
sacrifices
in
the
populace
of
holland
plunged
into
the
sea
a
woman
reputed
to
be
a
sorceress
and
as
the
miserable
woman
persisted
in
rising
to
the
surface
she
was
pronounced
guilty
and
was
beaten
to
death
it
was
believed
that
the
devil
could
transform
people
into
any
shape
he
pleased
and
whoever
denounced
this
idea
was
denounced
as
an
infidel
that
the
believers
in
witchcraft
appealed
to
the
devil
that
with
the
devil
were
associated
innumerable
spirits
who
ranged
over
the
world
endeavoring
to
torment
mankind
that
these
spirits
possessed
a
power
and
wisdom
transcending
the
limits
of
human
faculties
they
believed
the
devil
could
carry
persons
hundreds
of
miles
in
a
few
seconds
they
believed
this
because
they
knew
that
christ
had
been
carried
by
the
devil
in
the
same
manner
into
a
high
mountain
and
placed
upon
a
pinnacle
according
to
their
account
the
prince
of
the
air
had
absolutely
taken
the
god
of
this
infinite
universe
the
creator
of
all
its
shining
wheeling
stars
he
had
been
absolutely
taken
by
the
devil
to
a
pinnacle
of
the
temple
and
there
had
been
tempted
by
the
devil
to
cast
himself
to
the
earth
take
from
the
church
itself
the
threat
and
fear
of
hell
and
it
becomes
an
extinct
volcano
with
the
doctrine
of
hell
taken
from
the
church
that
is
the
end
of
the
fall
of
man
that
is
the
end
of
the
scheme
of
atonement
take
from
them
the
idea
of
an
eternal
place
of
torment
and
the
church
is
thrown
back
simply
upon
facts
and
dean
stanley
the
leading
ecclesiastic
of
great
britain
only
the
other
day
in
winchester
abbey
said
science
will
be
the
only
theology
of
the
future
morality
is
the
only
religion
of
the
years
to
come
not
withstanding
all
the
infamous
things
laid
to
the
charge
of
the
church
we
are
told
that
the
civilization
of
today
is
the
child
of
what
we
are
pleased
to
call
superstition
let
me
call
your
attention
to
what
they
received
from
their
fears
of
these
ghosts
let
me
give
you
an
outline
of
the
sciences
as
taught
by
those
philosophers
there
is
one
thing
that
a
man
is
interested
in
if
he
is
in
anything
and
that
is
in
the
science
of
medicine
a
doctor
is
so
to
speak
in
partnership
with
nature
he
is
a
preserver
if
he
is
worthy
of
the
name
and
now
i
want
to
show
what
they
have
gotten
from
these
ghosts
upon
the
science
of
medicine
according
to
them
all
of
the
diseases
were
produced
as
a
punishment
by
the
good
ghosts
or
out
of
pure
malignity
by
the
bad
ones
there
were
properly
speaking
no
diseases
the
sick
were
simply
possessed
by
ghosts
the
science
of
medicine
consisted
in
knowing
how
to
persuade
these
ghosts
to
vacate
the
premises
and
for
thousands
of
years
all
diseases
were
treated
with
incantations
hideous
noises
with
the
beating
of
drums
and
gongs
everything
was
done
to
make
the
position
of
a
ghost
as
unpleasant
as
possible
and
they
generally
succeeded
in
making
things
so
disagreeable
that
if
the
ghost
did
not
leave
the
patient
died
these
ghosts
were
supposed
to
be
different
in
rank
power
and
dignity
now
then
a
man
pretended
to
have
won
the
favor
of
some
powerful
ghost
who
gave
him
power
over
the
little
ones
such
a
man
became
a
very
great
physician
it
was
found
that
a
certain
kind
of
smoke
was
exceedingly
offensive
to
the
nostrils
of
your
ordinary
ghost
with
this
smoke
the
sick
room
would
be
filled
until
the
ghost
vanished
or
the
patient
died
it
was
also
believed
that
certain
words
when
properly
pronounced
were
the
most
effective
weapons
for
it
was
for
a
long
time
supposed
that
latin
words
were
the
best
i
suppose
because
latin
was
a
dead
language
for
thousands
of
years
medicine
consisted
in
driving
the
devils
out
of
men
in
some
instances
bargains
and
promises
were
made
with
the
ghosts
one
case
is
given
where
a
multitude
of
devils
traded
a
man
off
for
a
herd
of
swine
in
this
transaction
the
devils
were
the
losers
the
swine
having
immediately
drowned
themselves
in
the
sea
this
idea
of
disease
appears
to
have
been
almost
universal
and
is
not
yet
extinct
the
contortions
of
the
epileptic
the
strange
twitching
of
those
afflicted
with
cholera
were
all
seized
as
proof
that
the
bodies
of
men
were
filled
with
vile
and
malignant
spirits
whoever
endeavored
to
account
for
these
things
by
natural
causes
whoever
endeavored
to
cure
disease
by
natural
means
was
denounced
as
an
infidel
to
explain
anything
was
a
crime
it
was
to
the
interest
of
the
sacerdotal
class
that
all
things
should
be
accounted
for
by
the
will
and
power
of
god
and
the
devil
the
moment
it
is
admitted
that
all
phenomena
are
within
the
domain
of
the
natural
and
that
all
the
prayers
in
the
world
can
not
change
one
solitary
fact
the
necessity
for
the
priest
disappears
religion
breathes
the
idea
of
miracles
take
from
the
minds
of
men
the
idea
of
the
supernatural
and
superstition
ceases
to
exist
for
this
reason
the
church
has
always
despised
the
man
who
explains
the
wonderful
the
moment
that
it
began
to
be
apparent
that
prayer
could
do
nothing
for
the
body
the
priest
shifted
his
ground
and
began
praying
for
the
soul
after
the
devil
was
substantially
abandoned
in
the
practice
of
medicine
and
when
it
was
admitted
that
god
had
nothing
to
do
with
ordinary
coughs
and
colds
it
was
still
believed
that
all
the
diseases
were
sent
by
him
as
punishment
for
the
people
it
was
thought
to
be
a
kind
of
blasphemy
to
even
stay
the
ravages
of
pestilence
formerly
when
a
pestilence
fell
upon
a
people
the
arguments
of
the
priest
were
boundless
he
told
the
people
that
they
had
refused
to
pay
their
tithes
and
they
had
doubted
some
of
the
doctrines
of
the
church
that
in
their
hearts
they
had
contempt
for
some
of
the
priests
of
the
lord
and
god
was
now
taking
his
revenge
and
the
people
for
the
most
part
believed
this
issue
of
falsehood
and
hastened
to
fall
upon
their
knees
and
to
pour
out
their
wealth
upon
the
altars
of
hypocrisy
the
church
never
wanted
disease
to
be
absolutely
under
the
control
of
man
timothy
dwight
president
of
yale
college
preached
a
sermon
against
vaccination
his
idea
was
that
if
god
had
decreed
that
through
all
eternity
certain
men
should
die
of
small
pox
it
was
a
frightful
sin
to
endeavor
to
prevent
it
that
plagues
and
pestilence
were
instruments
in
the
hands
of
god
with
which
to
gain
the
love
and
worship
of
mankind
to
find
the
cure
for
the
disease
was
to
take
the
punishment
from
the
church
no
one
tries
to
cure
the
ague
with
prayer
because
quinine
has
been
found
to
be
altogether
more
reliable
just
as
soon
as
a
specific
is
found
for
a
disease
that
disease
is
left
out
of
the
list
of
prayer
the
number
of
diseases
with
which
god
from
time
to
time
afflicts
mankind
is
continually
decreasing
because
the
number
of
diseases
that
man
can
cure
is
continually
increasing
in
a
few
years
all
diseases
will
be
under
the
control
of
man
the
science
of
medicine
has
but
one
enemy
superstition
man
was
afraid
to
save
his
body
for
fear
he
would
lose
his
soul
is
it
any
wonder
that
the
people
in
those
days
believed
in
and
taught
the
infamous
doctrine
of
eternal
punishment
that
makes
god
a
heartless
monster
and
man
a
slimy
hypocrite
and
slave
the
ghosts
were
also
historians
and
wrote
the
grossest
absurdities
they
wrote
as
though
they
had
been
eye
witnesses
of
every
occurrence
they
told
all
the
past
they
predicted
all
the
future
with
an
impudence
that
amounted
to
sublimity
they
said
that
the
tartars
originally
came
from
hell
and
that
they
were
called
tartars
because
that
was
one
of
the
names
of
hell
these
gentlemen
accounted
for
the
red
on
the
breasts
of
robins
from
the
fact
that
those
birds
used
to
carry
water
to
the
unhappy
infants
in
hell
other
eminent
historians
say
that
nero
was
in
the
habit
of
vomiting
frogs
when
i
read
that
i
said
some
of
the
croakers
of
the
present
day
would
be
better
for
such
a
vomit
others
say
that
the
walls
of
a
city
fell
down
in
answer
to
prayer
they
tell
us
that
king
arthur
was
not
born
like
other
mortals
that
he
had
great
luck
in
killing
giants
that
one
of
the
giants
that
he
killed
wore
clothes
woven
from
the
beards
of
kings
that
he
had
slain
and
to
cap
the
climax
the
authors
of
this
history
were
rewarded
for
having
written
the
only
reliable
history
of
their
country
these
are
the
men
from
whom
we
get
our
creeds
and
our
confessions
of
faith
in
all
the
histories
of
those
days
there
is
hardly
a
truth
facts
were
not
considered
of
any
importance
they
wrote
and
the
people
believed
that
the
tracks
of
pharaoh
chariot
were
still
visible
upon
the
sands
of
the
red
sea
and
that
they
had
been
miraculously
preserved
as
perpetual
witnesses
of
the
miracles
that
had
been
performed
and
they
said
to
any
man
who
denied
it
go
there
and
you
will
find
the
tracks
still
upon
the
sand
they
accounted
for
everything
as
the
work
of
good
and
evil
spirits
with
cause
and
effect
they
had
nothing
to
do
facts
were
in
no
way
related
to
each
other
god
governed
by
infinite
caprice
filled
the
world
with
miracles
and
disconnected
events
and
from
his
quiver
came
the
arrows
of
pestilence
and
death
the
moment
the
idea
is
abandoned
that
everything
in
this
universe
is
natural
that
all
phenomena
are
the
necessary
links
in
the
endless
chain
of
being
the
conception
of
history
becomes
impossible
that
the
ghost
of
the
present
is
not
the
child
of
the
past
the
present
is
not
the
mother
of
the
future
in
the
domain
of
superstition
all
is
accident
and
caprice
and
do
not
i
pray
you
forget
that
the
writers
of
our
creeds
and
confessions
of
faith
believed
this
to
be
a
world
of
chance
nothing
happens
by
accident
nothing
happens
by
chance
in
the
wide
universe
everything
is
necessarily
produced
every
effect
has
behind
it
a
cause
every
effect
is
in
its
turn
a
cause
and
there
is
in
the
wide
domain
of
the
infinite
not
room
enough
for
a
miracle
when
i
say
this
i
mean
this
is
my
idea
i
may
be
wrong
but
that
is
my
idea
it
was
believed
by
our
intelligent
ancestors
that
all
law
derived
its
greatness
and
force
from
the
fact
that
it
had
been
communicated
to
man
by
ghosts
of
course
it
is
not
pretended
that
the
ghosts
told
everybody
the
law
but
they
told
it
to
a
few
and
the
few
told
it
to
the
people
and
the
people
as
a
rule
paid
them
exceedingly
well
for
the
trouble
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
people
commenced
making
laws
for
themselves
and
strange
as
it
may
appear
most
of
their
laws
are
vastly
superior
to
the
ghost
article
through
the
web
and
woof
of
human
legislation
gradually
began
to
run
and
shine
and
glitter
the
golden
thread
of
justice
during
these
years
of
darkness
it
was
believed
that
rather
than
see
an
act
of
injustice
done
rather
than
see
the
guilty
triumph
some
ghost
would
interfere
and
i
do
wish
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
that
was
the
truth
there
never
was
forced
upon
my
heart
a
more
frightful
conviction
than
this
the
right
does
not
always
prevail
there
never
was
forced
upon
my
mind
a
more
cruel
conclusion
than
this
innocence
is
not
always
a
sufficient
shield
i
wish
it
was
i
wish
too
that
man
suffered
nothing
but
that
which
he
brings
upon
himself
and
yet
i
find
that
in
nine
districts
in
india
between
the
day
of
last
january
and
the
day
of
june
people
starved
to
death
and
that
little
children
with
their
lips
upon
the
breasts
of
famine
died
wasted
away
and
why
simply
because
a
little
while
before
the
wind
did
not
veer
the
one
hundredth
part
of
a
degree
and
send
clouds
over
the
country
freighted
with
rain
freighted
with
love
and
joy
but
if
that
wind
had
just
turned
that
way
there
would
have
been
happy
men
women
and
children
all
clad
in
the
garments
of
health
i
wish
that
i
could
know
in
my
heart
that
there
was
some
power
that
would
see
to
it
that
men
and
women
got
exact
justice
somewhere
i
do
wish
that
i
knew
the
right
would
prevail
that
innocence
was
an
infinite
shield
during
these
years
it
was
believed
that
rather
than
see
an
act
of
injustice
done
some
ghost
would
interfere
this
belief
as
a
rule
gave
great
satisfaction
to
the
victorious
party
and
as
the
other
man
was
dead
no
complaint
was
ever
made
by
him
this
doctrine
was
a
sanctification
of
brute
force
and
chance
prisoners
were
made
to
grasp
hot
irons
and
if
it
burned
them
their
guilt
was
established
others
were
tied
hands
and
feet
and
cast
into
the
sea
and
if
they
sank
the
verdict
of
guilt
was
unanimous
if
they
did
not
sink
then
they
said
water
is
such
a
pure
element
that
it
refuses
to
take
a
guilty
person
and
consequently
he
is
a
witch
or
wizard
why
in
england
persons
accused
of
crime
could
appeal
to
the
cross
and
to
a
piece
of
sacramental
bread
if
he
could
swallow
this
without
choking
he
was
acquitted
and
this
practice
was
continued
until
the
time
of
king
edward
who
was
choked
to
death
after
which
it
was
discontinued
ghosts
and
their
followers
always
took
delight
in
torturing
with
unusual
pain
any
infraction
of
their
laws
and
generally
death
was
the
penalty
sometimes
when
a
man
committed
only
murder
he
was
permitted
to
flee
to
a
place
of
refuge
murder
being
only
a
crime
against
man
but
for
saying
certain
words
or
denying
certain
doctrines
or
for
worshiping
wrong
ghosts
or
for
failing
to
pray
to
the
right
one
or
for
laughing
at
a
priest
or
for
saying
that
wine
was
not
blood
or
bread
was
not
flesh
or
for
failing
to
regard
rams
horns
as
artillery
or
for
saying
that
a
raven
as
a
rule
was
a
poor
landlord
death
produced
by
all
the
ways
that
ingenuity
or
hatred
could
devise
was
the
penalty
suffered
by
these
men
i
tell
you
tonight
law
is
a
growth
law
is
a
science
right
and
wrong
exist
in
the
nature
of
things
things
are
not
right
because
they
are
commanded
they
are
not
wrong
because
they
are
prohibited
they
are
prohibited
because
we
believe
them
wrong
they
are
commended
because
we
believe
them
right
there
are
real
crimes
enough
without
creating
artificial
ones
all
progress
in
legislation
for
a
thousand
years
has
consisted
in
repealing
the
laws
of
the
ghosts
the
idea
of
right
and
wrong
is
born
of
man
capacity
to
enjoy
and
suffer
if
man
could
not
suffer
if
he
could
not
inflict
injury
upon
his
brother
if
he
could
neither
feel
nor
inflict
punishment
the
idea
of
law
the
idea
of
right
the
idea
of
wrong
never
could
have
entered
into
his
brain
if
man
could
not
suffer
if
he
could
not
inflict
suffering
the
word
conscience
never
would
have
passed
the
lips
of
man
there
is
one
good
happiness
there
is
one
sin
selfishness
all
laws
should
be
for
the
preservation
of
the
one
and
the
destruction
of
the
other
under
the
regime
of
the
ghosts
the
laws
were
not
understood
to
exist
in
the
nature
of
things
they
were
supposed
to
be
irresponsible
commands
and
these
commands
were
not
supposed
to
rest
upon
reason
they
were
simply
the
product
of
arbitrary
will
these
penalties
for
the
violations
of
those
laws
were
as
cruel
as
the
penalties
were
absurd
there
were
over
two
hundred
offenses
for
which
man
was
punished
with
death
think
of
it
and
these
laws
are
said
to
have
come
from
a
most
merciful
god
and
yet
we
have
become
civilized
to
that
degree
in
this
country
that
in
the
state
of
new
york
there
is
only
one
crime
punishable
with
death
think
of
it
did
i
not
tell
you
that
we
were
now
civilizing
our
gods
the
tendency
of
those
horrible
laws
the
tendency
of
those
frightful
penalties
was
to
blot
the
idea
of
justice
from
the
human
soul
now
i
want
to
show
you
how
perfectly
every
department
of
human
knowledge
or
rather
of
ignorance
was
saturated
with
superstition
i
will
for
a
moment
refer
to
the
science
of
language
it
was
thought
by
our
fathers
that
hebrew
was
the
original
language
that
it
was
taught
to
adam
and
eve
in
the
garden
of
eden
by
the
almighty
himself
every
fact
inconsistent
with
that
idea
was
thrown
away
according
to
the
ghosts
the
trouble
at
the
tower
of
babel
accounted
for
the
fact
that
all
the
people
did
not
speak
the
hebrew
language
the
babel
question
settled
all
questions
in
the
science
of
language
after
a
time
so
many
facts
were
found
to
be
so
inconsistent
with
the
hebrew
idea
that
it
began
to
fall
into
disrepute
and
other
languages
began
to
be
used
andrew
kent
published
a
work
on
the
science
of
language
in
which
he
stated
that
god
spoke
to
adam
and
adam
answered
in
hebrew
and
that
the
serpent
probably
spoke
to
eve
in
french
in
another
celebrated
work
was
published
at
antwerp
in
which
the
whole
matter
was
put
at
rest
showing
beyond
a
doubt
that
the
language
spoken
in
paradise
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
plain
holland
dutch
another
celebrated
writer
a
contemporary
of
sir
isaac
newton
discouraged
the
idea
that
all
languages
could
be
traced
to
one
he
maintained
that
language
was
of
natural
growth
that
we
speak
as
naturally
as
we
grow
we
talk
as
naturally
as
sings
a
bird
or
as
blooms
and
blossoms
a
flower
experience
teaches
us
that
this
be
so
words
are
continually
dying
and
continually
may
being
born
words
are
the
garments
of
thought
through
the
lapse
of
time
some
were
as
rude
as
the
skins
of
wild
beasts
and
others
pleasing
and
cultured
like
silk
and
gold
words
have
been
born
of
hatred
and
revenge
of
love
and
self
sacrifice
and
fear
of
agony
and
joy
the
stars
have
fashioned
them
and
in
them
mingled
the
darkness
and
the
dawn
every
word
that
we
get
from
the
past
is
so
to
speak
a
mummy
robed
in
the
linen
of
the
grave
they
are
the
crystallizations
of
human
history
of
all
that
man
enjoyed
of
all
that
man
has
suffered
his
victories
and
defeats
all
that
he
has
lost
and
won
words
are
the
shadows
of
all
that
has
been
they
are
the
mirrors
of
all
that
is
the
ghosts
also
enlightened
our
fathers
in
astronomy
and
geology
according
to
them
the
world
was
made
out
of
nothing
and
a
little
more
nothing
having
been
taken
than
was
used
in
the
construction
of
the
world
the
stars
were
made
out
of
the
scraps
that
were
left
over
cosmos
in
the
sixth
century
taught
that
the
stars
were
impelled
by
angels
who
carried
them
upon
their
shoulders
rolled
them
in
front
of
them
or
drew
them
after
he
also
taught
that
each
angel
who
pushed
a
star
took
great
pains
to
observe
what
the
other
angels
were
doing
so
that
the
relative
distances
between
the
stars
might
always
remain
the
same
he
stated
that
this
world
was
a
vast
body
of
water
with
a
strip
of
land
on
the
outside
that
adam
and
eve
lived
on
the
outer
strip
that
their
descendants
were
drowned
on
the
outer
strip
all
except
noah
and
his
family
he
accounted
for
night
and
day
by
saying
that
on
the
outer
strip
of
land
was
a
mountain
around
which
the
sun
revolved
producing
darkness
when
it
was
hidden
from
sight
and
daylight
when
it
emerged
he
also
declared
the
earth
to
be
flat
this
he
proved
by
many
passages
from
the
bible
among
other
reasons
for
believing
the
earth
to
be
flat
he
referred
to
a
passage
in
the
new
testament
which
says
that
christ
shall
come
again
in
glory
and
power
and
every
eye
shall
see
him
and
said
now
if
the
world
is
round
how
are
the
people
on
the
other
side
going
to
see
christ
when
he
comes
that
settled
the
question
and
the
church
not
only
indorsed
this
book
but
declared
that
whoever
believed
either
less
or
more
was
a
heretic
and
would
be
dealt
with
as
such
in
those
blessed
days
ignorance
was
a
king
and
science
was
an
outcast
the
church
knew
that
the
moment
the
earth
ceased
to
be
the
center
of
the
universe
and
became
a
mere
speck
in
the
starry
sphere
of
existence
every
religion
would
become
a
thing
of
the
past
in
the
name
and
by
the
authority
of
the
ghosts
men
enslaved
their
fellowmen
they
trampled
upon
the
rights
of
women
and
children
in
the
name
and
by
the
authority
of
ghosts
they
bought
and
sold
each
other
they
filled
heaven
with
tyrants
and
the
earth
with
slaves
they
filled
the
present
with
intolerance
and
the
future
with
horror
in
the
name
and
by
the
authority
of
the
ghosts
they
declared
superstition
to
be
the
real
religion
in
the
name
and
by
the
authority
of
the
ghosts
they
imprisoned
the
human
mind
they
polluted
the
conscience
they
subverted
justice
and
they
sainted
hypocrisy
i
have
endeavored
in
some
degree
to
show
you
what
has
been
and
always
will
be
when
men
are
governed
by
superstition
when
they
destroy
the
sublime
standard
of
reason
when
they
take
the
words
of
others
and
do
not
investigate
them
themselves
even
the
great
men
of
those
days
appear
nearly
as
weak
as
the
most
ignorant
one
of
the
greatest
men
of
the
world
an
astronomer
second
to
none
discoverer
of
the
three
great
laws
that
explain
the
solar
system
was
an
astrologer
and
believed
that
he
could
predict
the
career
of
a
man
by
finding
what
star
was
in
the
ascendant
at
his
birth
he
believed
in
what
is
called
the
music
of
the
spheres
and
he
ascribed
the
qualities
of
the
music
alto
bass
tenor
and
treble
to
certain
of
the
planets
another
man
kept
an
idiot
whose
words
he
put
down
and
then
put
them
together
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
promises
and
waited
patiently
to
see
that
they
were
fulfilled
luther
believed
he
had
actually
seen
the
devil
and
discussed
points
of
theology
with
him
the
human
mind
was
enchained
every
idea
almost
was
a
mystery
facts
were
looked
upon
as
worthless
only
the
wonderful
was
worth
preserving
devils
were
thought
to
be
the
most
industrious
beings
in
the
universe
and
with
these
imps
every
occurrence
of
an
unusual
character
was
connected
there
was
no
order
certainty
everything
depended
upon
ghosts
and
phantoms
and
man
for
the
most
part
considered
himself
at
the
mercy
of
malevolent
spirits
he
protected
himself
as
best
he
could
with
holy
water
and
with
tapers
and
wafers
and
cathedrals
he
made
noises
to
frighten
the
ghosts
and
music
to
charm
them
he
fasted
when
he
was
hungry
and
he
feasted
when
he
was
not
he
believed
everything
unreasonable
he
humbled
himself
he
crawled
in
the
dust
he
shut
the
doors
and
windows
and
excluded
every
ray
of
light
from
his
soul
and
he
delayed
not
a
day
to
repair
the
walls
of
his
own
prison
and
from
the
garden
of
the
human
heart
they
plucked
and
trampled
into
the
bloody
dust
the
flowers
and
blossoms
they
denounced
man
as
totally
depraved
they
made
reason
blasphemy
they
made
pity
a
crime
nothing
so
delighted
them
as
painting
the
torments
and
tortures
of
the
damned
over
the
worm
that
never
dies
they
grew
poetic
according
to
them
the
cries
ascending
from
hell
were
the
perfume
of
heaven
they
divided
the
world
into
saints
and
sinners
and
all
the
saints
were
going
to
heaven
and
all
the
sinners
yonder
now
then
you
stand
in
the
presence
of
a
great
disaster
a
house
is
on
fire
and
there
is
seen
at
a
window
the
frightened
face
of
a
woman
with
a
babe
in
her
arms
appealing
for
help
humanity
cries
out
will
someone
go
to
the
rescue
they
do
not
ask
for
a
methodist
a
baptist
or
a
catholic
they
ask
for
a
man
all
at
once
there
starts
from
the
crowd
one
that
nobody
ever
suspected
of
being
a
saint
one
may
be
with
a
bad
reputation
but
he
goes
up
the
ladder
and
is
lost
in
the
smoke
and
flame
and
a
moment
after
he
emerges
and
the
great
circles
of
flame
hiss
around
him
in
a
moment
more
he
has
reached
the
window
in
another
moment
with
the
woman
and
child
in
his
arms
he
reaches
the
ground
and
gives
his
fainting
burden
to
the
bystanders
and
the
people
all
stand
hushed
for
a
moment
as
they
always
do
at
such
times
and
then
the
air
is
rent
with
acclamations
tell
me
that
that
man
is
going
to
be
sent
to
hell
to
eternal
flames
who
is
willing
to
risk
his
life
rather
than
a
woman
and
child
should
suffer
from
the
fire
one
moment
i
despise
that
doctrine
of
hell
any
man
that
believes
in
eternal
hell
is
afflicted
with
at
least
two
diseases
petrifaction
of
the
heart
and
petrifaction
of
the
brain
i
have
seen
upon
the
field
of
battle
a
boy
sixteen
years
of
age
struck
by
a
fragment
of
a
shell
i
have
seen
him
fall
i
have
seen
him
die
with
a
curse
upon
his
lips
and
the
face
of
his
mother
in
his
heart
tell
me
that
his
soul
will
be
hurled
from
the
field
of
battle
where
he
lost
his
life
that
his
country
might
live
where
he
lost
his
life
for
the
liberties
of
man
tell
me
that
he
will
be
hurled
from
that
field
to
eternal
torment
i
pronounce
it
an
infamous
lie
and
yet
according
to
these
gentlemen
that
is
to
be
the
fate
of
nearly
all
the
splendid
fellows
in
this
world
i
had
in
my
possession
a
little
while
ago
a
piece
of
fresco
that
used
to
adorn
a
church
at
the
place
where
shakespeare
lived
and
there
was
a
picture
representing
the
morning
of
the
resurrection
and
people
were
getting
out
of
their
graves
and
devils
were
grabbing
them
by
their
heels
and
there
was
an
immense
monster
with
jaws
open
so
wide
that
a
man
could
walk
down
its
throat
and
the
flames
were
issuing
therefrom
and
there
were
devils
driving
people
in
droves
down
the
throat
of
this
monster
and
there
was
an
immense
kettle
in
which
they
had
put
these
men
and
the
fire
was
being
stirred
under
it
and
hot
pitch
was
being
poured
on
top
and
little
devils
were
setting
it
on
fire
and
then
on
the
walls
there
were
hundreds
hung
up
by
their
tongues
to
hooks
and
nails
and
then
the
saved
there
were
some
five
or
six
saved
upon
the
horizon
and
they
had
a
most
grin
of
i
told
you
so
at
the
risk
of
being
tiresome
i
have
said
that
i
have
to
show
the
direction
of
the
human
mind
in
slavery
the
effects
of
widespread
ignorance
and
the
result
of
fear
i
want
to
convince
you
that
every
form
of
slavery
physical
or
mental
is
a
viper
that
will
finally
fill
with
poison
the
breast
of
any
man
alive
i
want
to
show
you
that
there
should
be
republicanism
in
the
domain
of
thought
as
well
as
in
civil
government
the
first
step
toward
progress
is
for
man
to
cease
to
be
the
slave
of
the
creatures
of
his
creation
men
found
at
last
that
the
event
is
more
valuable
than
the
prophecy
especially
if
it
never
comes
to
pass
they
found
that
diseases
were
not
produced
by
spirits
that
they
could
not
be
cured
by
frightening
them
away
they
found
that
death
was
as
natural
as
life
they
began
to
study
the
anatomy
and
chemistry
of
the
human
body
and
they
found
that
all
was
natural
and
the
conjurer
and
the
sorcerer
were
dismissed
and
the
physician
and
surgeon
were
employed
they
learned
that
being
born
under
a
star
or
planet
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
luck
the
astrologer
was
discharged
and
the
astronomer
took
his
place
they
found
that
the
world
had
swept
through
the
constellation
for
millions
of
ages
they
found
that
diseases
were
produced
as
easily
as
grass
and
were
not
sent
as
punishment
on
men
for
failing
to
believe
a
creed
they
found
that
man
through
intelligence
could
take
advantage
of
the
affairs
of
nature
that
he
could
make
the
waves
the
winds
the
flames
and
the
lightnings
slaves
at
his
bidding
to
administer
to
his
wants
they
found
the
ghosts
knew
nothing
of
benefit
to
man
that
they
were
entirely
ignorant
of
history
that
they
were
bad
doctors
and
worse
surgeons
that
they
knew
nothing
of
the
law
and
less
of
justice
that
they
were
poor
politicians
that
they
were
tyrants
and
that
they
were
without
brains
and
utterly
destitute
of
hearts
the
condition
of
this
world
during
the
dark
ages
shows
exactly
the
result
of
enslaving
the
souls
of
men
in
those
days
there
was
no
liberty
liberty
was
despised
and
the
laborer
was
considered
but
little
above
the
beast
ignorance
like
a
vast
cowl
covered
the
brain
of
the
world
superstition
ran
riot
and
credulity
sat
upon
the
throne
of
the
soul
murder
and
hypocrisy
were
the
companions
of
man
and
industry
was
a
slave
every
country
maintained
that
it
was
no
robbery
to
take
the
property
of
mohammedans
by
force
and
no
murder
to
kill
the
owner
lord
bacon
was
the
first
man
who
maintained
that
a
christian
country
was
bound
to
keep
its
plighted
faith
with
a
mohammedan
nation
every
man
who
could
read
or
write
was
suspected
of
being
a
heretic
in
those
days
only
one
person
in
could
read
or
write
all
thought
was
discouraged
the
whole
earth
was
ruled
by
the
mitre
and
sceptre
by
the
altar
and
throne
by
fear
and
force
by
ignorance
and
faith
by
ghouls
and
ghosts
in
the
century
the
following
law
was
in
force
in
england
whosoever
reads
the
scripture
in
the
mother
tongue
shall
forfeit
land
cattle
life
and
goods
for
themselves
and
their
heirs
forever
and
should
be
condemned
for
heretics
to
god
enemies
to
the
crown
and
traitors
to
the
land
during
the
period
this
law
was
in
force
were
hanged
and
their
bodies
burned
in
the
century
men
were
burned
because
they
failed
to
kneel
to
a
procession
of
monks
even
the
reformers
so
called
had
no
idea
of
liberty
only
when
in
the
minority
the
moment
they
were
clothed
with
power
they
began
to
exterminate
with
fire
and
sword
castillo
and
i
want
you
to
recollect
it
was
the
first
minister
in
the
world
that
declared
in
favor
of
universal
toleration
castillo
was
pursued
by
john
calvin
like
a
wild
beast
calvin
said
that
such
a
monstrous
doctrine
he
crucified
christ
afresh
and
they
pursued
that
man
until
he
died
recollect
it
they
ca
do
that
you
do
know
how
splendid
i
feel
about
the
liberty
i
have
the
horizon
is
filled
with
glory
and
the
air
is
filled
with
wings
if
there
are
any
in
this
world
who
think
they
had
better
not
tell
what
they
really
think
because
it
will
take
bread
from
their
little
children
because
it
will
take
clothing
from
their
families
do
do
it
do
make
martyrs
of
yourselves
i
believe
in
martyrdom
go
right
along
with
them
go
to
church
and
say
amen
as
near
the
right
place
as
you
can
i
will
do
your
talking
for
you
they
ca
take
the
bread
away
from
me
i
will
talk
bodemus
a
lawyer
of
france
wrote
a
few
words
in
favor
of
freedom
of
conscience
montaigne
was
the
first
to
raise
his
voice
against
torture
in
france
but
what
was
the
voice
of
one
man
against
the
terrible
cry
of
ignorant
infatuated
malevolent
millions
i
intend
to
do
what
little
i
can
and
i
am
going
to
do
it
kindly
i
am
going
to
appeal
to
reason
and
to
charity
to
justice
to
science
and
to
the
future
for
my
part
i
glory
in
the
fact
that
in
the
new
world
in
the
united
states
liberty
of
conscience
was
first
granted
to
man
and
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
the
first
great
decree
entered
in
the
high
court
of
human
equity
forever
divorcing
church
and
state
it
is
the
grandest
step
ever
taken
by
the
human
race
and
the
declaration
of
independence
was
the
first
document
that
retired
ghosts
from
politics
it
is
the
first
document
that
said
authority
does
not
come
from
the
phantoms
of
the
air
authority
is
not
from
that
direction
it
comes
from
the
people
themselves
the
declaration
of
independence
enthroned
man
and
dethroned
the
phantoms
you
will
ask
what
has
caused
this
change
in
three
hundred
years
i
answer
the
inventions
and
discoveries
of
the
few
the
brave
thoughts
and
heroic
utterances
of
the
few
the
acquisition
of
a
few
facts
getting
acquainted
with
our
mother
nature
besides
this
you
must
remember
that
every
wrong
in
some
way
tends
to
abolish
itself
it
is
hard
to
make
a
lie
last
always
a
lie
will
not
fit
the
truth
it
will
only
fit
another
lie
told
on
purpose
to
fit
it
nothing
but
truth
lives
the
nobles
and
the
kings
quarreled
the
priests
began
to
dispute
and
the
millions
began
to
get
their
rights
in
printing
was
discovered
at
that
time
the
past
was
a
vast
cemetery
without
an
epitaph
the
ideas
of
men
had
mostly
perished
in
the
brains
that
had
produced
them
printing
gives
an
opening
for
thought
it
preserves
ideas
it
made
it
possible
for
a
man
to
bequeath
to
the
world
the
wealth
of
his
thoughts
about
the
same
time
or
a
little
before
the
moors
had
gone
into
europe
and
it
can
be
truthfully
said
that
science
was
thrust
into
the
brain
of
europe
upon
the
point
of
a
moorish
lance
they
gave
us
paper
and
what
is
printing
without
paper
a
bird
without
wings
i
tell
you
paper
has
been
a
splendid
thing
the
discovery
of
america
whose
shores
were
trod
by
the
restless
feet
of
adventure
and
the
people
of
every
nation
out
of
this
strange
mingling
of
facts
and
fancies
came
the
great
republic
every
fact
has
pushed
a
superstition
from
the
brain
and
a
ghost
from
the
cloud
every
mechanical
art
is
an
educator
every
loom
every
reaper
every
mower
every
steamboat
every
locomotive
every
engine
every
press
every
telegraph
is
a
missionary
of
science
and
an
apostle
of
progress
every
mill
every
furnace
with
its
wheels
and
levers
in
which
something
is
made
for
the
convenience
for
the
use
and
the
comfort
and
the
of
man
is
my
kind
of
church
and
every
schoolhouse
is
a
temple
education
is
the
most
radical
thing
in
this
world
to
teach
the
alphabet
is
to
inaugurate
a
revolution
to
build
a
schoolhouse
is
to
construct
a
fort
every
library
is
an
arsenal
filled
with
the
weapons
and
ammunition
of
progress
every
fact
is
a
monitor
with
sides
of
iron
and
a
turret
of
steel

the
inventors
and

protesting

the
abuses

him
because
he
was
an
enemy
of
liberty
i
thank
calvin
for
writing
a
book
in
favor
of
religious
freedom
but
i
abhor
him
because
he
burned
servetus
i
thank
the
puritans
for
saying
that
resistance
to
tyrants
is
obedience
to
god
and
yet
i
am
compelled
to
admit
that
they
were
tyrants
themselves
i
thank
thomas
paine
because
he
was
a
believer
in
liberty
i
thank
voltaire
that
great
man
who
for
half
a
century
was
the
intellectual
monarch
of
europe
and
who
from
his
throne
at
the
foot
of
the
alps
pointed
the
finger
of
scorn
at
every
hypocrite
in
christendom
i
thank
the
inventors
i
thank
the
discoverers
the
thinkers
and
the
scientists
and
i
thank
the
honest
millions
who
have
toiled
i
thank
the
brave
men
with
brave
thoughts
they
are
the
atlases
upon
whose
broad
and
mighty
shoulders
rests
the
grand
fabric
of
civilization
they
are
the
men
who
have
broken
and
are
still
breaking
the
chains
of
superstition
we
are
beginning
to
learn
that
to
swap
off
a
superstition
for
a
fact
to
ascertain
the
real
is
to
progress
all
that
gives
us
better
bodies
and
minds
and
clothes
and
food
and
pictures
grander
music
better
heads
better
hearts
and
that
makes
us
better
husbands
and
wives
and
better
citizens
all
these
things
combined
produce
what
we
call
the
progress
of
the
human
race
man
advances
only
as
he
overcomes
the
obstacles
of
nature
it
is
done
by
labor
and
thought
labor
is
the
foundation
without
great
labor
it
is
impossible
to
progress
without
labor
on
the
part
of
those
who
conduct
all
great
industries
of
life
of
those
who
battle
with
the
obstacles
of
the
sea
on
the
part
of
the
inventors
the
discoverers
and
the
brave
heroic
thinkers
no
surplus
is
produced
and
from
the
surplus
produced
by
labor
spring
the
schools
and
universities
the
painters
the
sculptors
the
poets
the
hopes
the
loves
and
the
aspirations
of
the
world
the
surplus
has
given
us
the
books
it
has
given
us
all
there
is
of
beauty
and
eloquence
i
am
aware
there
is
a
vast
difference
of
opinion
as
to
what
progress
is
and
that
many
denounce
my
ideas
i
know
there
are
many
worshipers
of
the
past
they
see
no
beauty
in
anything
from
which
they
do
not
blow
the
dust
of
ages
with
the
breath
of
praise
they
see
nothing
like
the
ancients
no
orators
poets
or
statesmen
like
those
who
have
been
dust
for
thousands
of
years
in
a
sermon
on
a
certain
evening
some
time
ago
the
rev
magee
of
albany
stated
that
colonel
ingersoll
referring
to
jesus
christ
called
him
a
dirty
little
jew
i
denounce
that
as
a
dirty
little
lie
i
have
as
much
reverence
for
any
man
who
ever
did
what
he
believed
was
right
and
died
in
order
to
benefit
mankind
as
any
man
in
this
world
do
they
treat
an
opponent
with
fairness
are
they
investigating
do
they
pull
forward
or
do
they
hold
back
is
science
indebted
to
the
church
for
a
single
fact
let
us
know
what
it
is
what
church
has
been
the
asylum
for
a
persecuted
truth
what
reform
has
been
inaugurated
by
the
church
did
the
church
abolish
slavery
no
who
commenced
it
such
men
as
garrison
and
pillsbury
and
wendel
phillips
they
were
the
titans
that
attacked
the
monster
and
not
a
solitary
one
of
them
ever
belonged
to
a
church
has
the
church
raised
its
voice
against
war
no
are
men
restrained
by
superstition
are
men
restrained
by
what
you
call
religion
i
used
to
think
they
were
not
now
i
admit
they
are
no
man
has
ever
been
restrained
from
the
commission
of
a
real
crime
but
from
an
artificial
one
he
has
there
was
a
man
who
committed
murder
they
got
the
evidence
but
he
confessed
that
he
did
it
what
did
you
do
it
for
money
did
you
get
any
money
yes
how
much
fifteen
cents
what
kind
of
a
man
was
he
a
laboring
man
i
killed
what
did
you
do
with
the
money
i
bought
liquor
with
it
did
he
have
anything
else
i
think
he
had
some
meat
and
bread
what
did
you
do
with
that
i
ate
the
bread
and
threw
away
the
meat
it
was
friday
so
you
see
it
will
restrain
in
some
things
just
to
the
extent
that
man
has
freed
himself
from
the
dominion
of
ghosts
he
has
advanced
to
that
extent
he
has
freed
himself
from
the
tyrant
poison
man
has
found
that
he
must
give
liberty
to
others
in
order
to
have
it
himself
he
has
found
that
a
master
is
a
slave
that
a
tyrant
is
also
a
slave
he
has
found
that
governments
should
be
administered
by
men
for
men
that
the
rights
of
all
are
to
be
protected
that
woman
is
at
least
the
equal
for
man
that
men
existed
before
books
that
all
creeds
were
made
by
men
that
the
few
have
a
right
to
contradict
what
the
pulpit
asserts
that
man
is
responsible
to
himself
and
to
others
true
religion
must
be
free
without
liberty
the
brain
is
a
dungeon
and
the
mind
the
convict
the
slave
may
bow
and
cringe
and
crawl
but
he
can
not
worship
he
can
not
adore
true
religion
is
the
perfume
of
the
free
and
grateful
air
true
religion
is
the
subordination
of
the
passions
to
the
intellect
it
is
not
a
creed
it
is
a
life
the
theory
that
is
afraid
of
investigation
is
not
deserving
of
a
place
in
the
human
mind
i
do
not
pretend
to
tell
what
all
the
truth
is
i
do
not
pretend
to
have
fathomed
the
abyss
nor
to
have
floated
on
outstretched
wings
level
with
the
heights
of
thought
i
simply
plead
for
freedom
i
denounce
the
cruelties
and
horrors
of
slavery
i
ask
for
light
and
air
for
the
souls
of
men
i
say
take
off
those
chains
break
those
manacles
free
those
limbs
release
that
brain
i
plead
for
the
right
to
think
to
reason
to
investigate
i
ask
that
the
future
may
be
enriched
with
the
honest
thoughts
of
men
i
implore
every
human
being
to
be
a
soldier
in
the
army
of
progress
i
will
not
invade
the
rights
of
others
you
have
no
right
to
erect
your
upon
the
highways
of
thought
you
have
no
right
to
leap
from
the
hedges
of
superstition
and
strike
down
the
pioneers
of
the
human
race
you
have
no
right
to
sacrifice
the
liberties
of
man
upon
the
altars
of
ghosts
believe
what
you
may
preach
what
you
desire
have
all
the
forms
and
ceremonies
you
please
exercise
your
liberties
in
your
own
way
and
extend
to
all
others
the
same
right
i
attack
the
monsters
the
phantoms
of
imagination
that
have
ruled
the
world
i
attack
slavery
i
ask
for
room
room
for
the
human
mind
why
should
we
sacrifice
a
real
world
that
we
have
for
one
we
know
not
of
why
should
we
enslave
ourselves
why
should
we
forge
fetters
for
our
own
hands
why
should
we
be
the
slaves
of
phantoms
phantoms
that
we
create
ourselves
the
darkness
of
barbarism
was
the
womb
of
these
shadows
in
the
light
of
science
they
can
not
cloud
the
sky
forever
they
have
reddened
the
hands
of
man
with
innocent
blood
they
made
the
cradle
a
curse
and
the
grave
a
place
of
torment
they
blinded
the
eyes
and
stopped
the
ears
of
the
human
race
they
subverted
all
the
ideas
of
justice
by
promising
infinite
rewards
for
finite
virtues
and
threatening
infinite
punishment
for
finite
offenses
i
plead
for
light
for
air
for
opportunity
i
plead
for
individual
independence
i
plead
for
the
rights
of
labor
and
of
thought
i
plead
for
a
chainless
future
let
the
ghosts
go
justice
remains
let
them
disappear
men
women
and
children
are
left
let
the
monster
fade
away
the
world
remains
with
its
hills
and
seas
and
plains
with
its
seasons
of
smiles
and
frowns
its
springs
of
leaf
and
bud
its
summer
of
shade
and
flower
its
autumn
with
the
laden
boughs
when
the
withered
banners
of
the
corn
are
still
and
gathered
fields
are
growing
strangely
wan
while
death
poetic
death
with
hands
that
color
they
touch
weaves
in
the
autumn
wood
her
tapestries
of
gold
and
brown
the
world
remains
with
its
winters
and
homes
and
firesides
where
grow
and
bloom
the
virtues
of
our
race
all
these
are
left
and
music
with
its
sad
and
thrilling
voice
and
all
there
is
of
art
and
song
and
hope
and
love
and
aspiration
high
all
these
remain
let
the
ghosts
go
we
will
worship
them
no
more
man
is
greater
than
these
phantoms
humanity
is
grander
than
all
the
creeds
than
all
the
books
humanity
is
the
great
sea
and
these
creeds
and
books
and
religions
are
but
the
waves
of
a
day
humanity
is
the
sky
and
these
religions
and
dogmas
and
theories
are
but
the
mists
and
clouds
changing
continually
destined
finally
to
melt
away
let
the
ghosts
go
we
will
worship
them
no
more
let
them
cover
their
eyeless
sockets
with
their
fleshless
hands
and
fade
forever
from
the
imaginations
of
men
ingersoll
lecture
on
hell
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
idea
of
a
hell
was
born
of
revenge
and
brutality
on
the
one
side
and
cowardice
on
the
other
in
my
judgment
the
american
people
are
too
brave
too
charitable
too
generous
too
magnanimous
to
believe
in
the
infamous
dogma
of
an
eternal
hell
i
have
no
respect
for
any
human
being
who
believes
in
it
i
have
no
respect
for
the
man
who
will
pollute
the
imagination
of
childhood
with
that
infamous
lie
i
have
no
respect
for
the
man
who
will
add
to
the
sorrows
of
this
world
with
the
frightful
dogma
i
have
no
respect
for
any
man
who
endeavors
to
put
that
infinite
cloud
that
infinite
shadow
over
the
heart
of
humanity
i
want
to
be
frank
with
you
i
dislike
this
doctrine
i
hate
it
i
despise
it
i
defy
this
doctrine
for
a
good
many
years
the
learned
intellects
of
christendom
have
been
examining
into
the
religions
of
other
countries
in
the
world
the
religions
of
the
thousands
that
have
passed
away
they
examined
into
the
religions
of
egypt
the
religion
of
greece
the
religion
of
rome
and
of
the
scandinavian
countries
in
the
presence
of
the
ruins
of
those
religions
the
learned
men
of
christendom
insisted
that
those
religions
were
baseless
that
they
are
fraudulent
but
they
have
all
passed
away
while
this
was
being
done
the
christianity
of
our
day
applauded
and
when
the
learned
men
got
through
with
the
religions
of
other
countries
they
turned
their
attention
to
our
religion
by
the
same
mode
of
reasoning
by
the
same
methods
by
the
same
arguments
that
they
used
with
the
old
religions
they
were
overturning
the
religion
of
our
day
why
every
religion
in
this
world
is
the
work
of
man
every
one
every
book
has
been
written
by
man
men
existed
before
the
books
if
books
had
existed
before
man
i
might
admit
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
sacred
volume
in
my
judgment
man
has
made
every
religion
and
made
every
book
there
is
another
thing
to
which
i
wish
to
call
your
attention
man
never
had
an
idea
man
will
never
have
an
idea
except
those
supplied
to
him
by
his
surroundings
every
idea
in
the
world
that
man
has
came
to
him
by
nature
man
can
not
conceive
of
anything
the
hint
of
which
you
have
not
received
from
your
surroundings
you
can
imagine
an
animal
with
the
hoof
of
a
bison
with
the
pouch
of
the
kangaroo
with
the
wings
of
an
eagle
with
the
beak
of
a
bird
and
with
the
tail
of
the
lion
and
yet
every
point
of
this
monster
you
borrowed
from
nature
every
thing
you
can
think
of
every
thing
you
can
dream
of
is
borrowed
from
your
surroundings
everything
and
there
is
nothing
on
this
earth
coming
from
any
other
sphere
whatever
man
has
produced
every
religion
in
the
world
and
why
because
each
generation
bodes
forth
the
knowledge
and
the
belief
of
the
people
at
the
time
it
was
made
and
in
no
book
is
there
any
knowledge
found
except
that
of
the
people
who
wrote
it
in
no
book
is
there
found
any
knowledge
except
that
of
the
time
in
which
it
was
written
barbarians
have
produced
and
always
will
produce
barbarian
religions
barbarians
have
produced
and
always
will
produce
ideas
in
harmony
with
their
surroundings
and
all
the
religions
of
the
past
were
produced
by
barbarians
every
one
of
them
we
are
making
religions
today
we
are
making
religions
that
is
to
say
we
are
changing
them
and
the
religion
of
is
not
the
religion
of
one
year
ago
what
changed
it
science
has
done
it
education
and
the
growing
heart
of
man
has
done
it
we
are
making
these
religions
every
day
and
just
to
the
extent
that
we
become
civilized
ourselves
will
we
improve
the
religion
of
our
fathers
if
the
religion
of
one
hundred
years
ago
compared
with
the
religion
of
is
so
low
what
will
it
be
in
one
thousand
years
if
we
continue
making
the
inroads
upon
orthodoxy
which
we
have
been
making
during
the
last
years
what
will
it
be
fifty
years
from
it
will
have
to
be
remonetized
by
that
time
or
else
it
will
not
be
legal
tender
in
my
judgment
every
religion
that
stands
by
appealing
to
miracles
is
dishonor
sic
every
religion
in
the
world
has
denounced
every
other
religion
as
a
fraud
that
proves
to
me
that
they
all
tell
the
truth
about
others
why
suppose
smith
should
tell
brown
that
he
smith
saw
a
corpse
get
out
of
the
grave
and
that
when
he
first
saw
it
it
was
covered
with
the
worm
of
death
and
that
in
his
presence
it
was
reclothed
in
healthy
beautiful
flesh
and
then
suppose
brown
should
tell
smith
i
saw
the
same
thing
myself
i
was
in
a
graveyard
once
and
i
saw
a
dead
man
rise
suppose
then
that
smith
should
say
to
brown
you
a
liar
and
brown
should
reply
to
smith
and
you
a
liar
what
would
you
think
it
would
simply
be
because
smith
never
having
seen
it
himself
did
believe
brown
and
brown
never
having
seen
it
did
believe
smith
had
now
if
smith
had
really
seen
it
and
brown
told
him
he
had
seen
it
too
then
smith
would
regard
it
as
a
corroboration
of
his
story
and
he
would
regard
brown
as
one
of
his
principal
witnesses
but
on
the
contrary
he
says
you
never
saw
it
so
when
man
says
i
was
upon
mount
sinai
and
there
i
met
god
and
he
told
me
aside
and
let
me
drown
these
people
and
another
man
says
to
him
i
was
upon
a
mountain
and
there
i
met
the
supreme
brahma
and
moses
says
not
true
and
contends
that
the
other
man
never
did
see
brahma
and
he
contends
that
moses
never
did
see
god
that
is
in
my
judgment
proof
that
they
both
speak
truly
every
religion
then
has
charged
every
other
religion
with
having
been
an
unmitigated
fraud
and
yet
if
any
man
had
ever
seen
the
miracle
himself
his
mind
would
be
prepared
to
believe
that
another
man
had
seen
the
same
thing
whenever
a
man
appeals
to
a
miracle
he
tells
what
is
not
true
truth
relies
upon
reason
and
the
undeviating
course
of
all
the
laws
of
nature
now
we
have
a
religion
that
is
some
people
have
i
do
not
pretend
to
have
religion
myself
i
believe
in
living
for
this
world
that
my
doctrine
in
living
here
now
that
my
doctrine
to
make
everybody
happy
that
you
can
now
let
the
future
take
care
of
itself
and
if
i
ever
touch
the
shores
of
another
world
i
will
be
just
as
ready
and
anxious
to
get
into
some
remunerative
employment
as
anybody
else
now
we
have
got
in
this
country
a
religion
which
men
have
preached
for
about
eighteen
hundred
years
and
just
in
proportion
as
their
belief
in
that
religion
has
grown
great
men
have
grown
mean
and
wicked
just
in
proportion
as
they
have
ceased
to
believe
it
men
have
become
just
and
charitable
and
if
they
believe
it
as
they
once
believed
it
i
would
be
allowed
to
speak
in
the
city
of
new
york
it
is
from
the
coldness
and
infidelity
of
the
churches
that
i
get
my
right
to
preach
and
i
say
it
to
their
credit
now
we
have
a
religion
what
is
it
they
say
in
the
first
place
that
all
this
vast
universe
was
created
by
a
deity
i
do
know
whether
it
was
or
not
they
say
too
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
first
sin
of
adam
there
would
never
have
been
any
devil
in
this
world
and
if
there
had
been
no
devil
there
would
have
been
no
sin
and
if
there
had
been
no
sin
there
never
would
have
been
any
death
for
my
part
i
am
glad
there
was
somebody
had
to
die
to
give
me
room
and
when
my
turn
comes
i
be
willing
to
let
somebody
else
take
my
place
but
whether
there
is
another
life
or
not
if
there
is
any
being
who
gave
me
this
i
shall
thank
him
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
because
upon
the
whole
my
life
has
been
a
joy
now
they
say
because
of
this
first
sin
all
men
were
consigned
to
eternal
hell
and
this
because
adam
was
our
representative
well
i
always
had
an
idea
that
my
representative
ought
to
live
somewhere
about
the
same
time
i
do
i
always
had
an
idea
that
i
should
have
some
voice
in
choosing
my
representative
and
if
i
had
a
voice
i
never
should
have
voted
for
the
old
gentleman
called
adam
now
in
order
to
regain
man
from
the
frightful
hell
of
eternity
christ
himself
came
to
this
world
and
took
upon
himself
flesh
and
in
order
that
we
might
know
the
road
to
eternal
salvation
he
gave
us
a
book
and
that
book
is
called
the
bible
and
whenever
that
bible
has
been
read
men
have
immediately
commenced
cutting
each
others
throats
wherever
that
bible
has
been
circulated
they
have
invented
inquisitions
and
instruments
of
torture
and
they
commenced
hating
each
other
with
all
their
hearts
but
i
am
told
now
we
are
all
told
that
this
bible
is
the
foundation
of
civilization
but
i
say
that
this
bible
is
the
foundation
of
hell
and
we
never
shall
get
rid
of
the
dogma
of
hell
until
we
get
rid
of
the
idea
that
it
is
an
inspired
book
now
what
does
the
bible
teach
i
am
not
going
to
talk
about
what
this
minister
or
that
minister
says
it
teaches
the
question
is
ought
a
man
to
be
sent
to
eternal
hell
for
not
believing
this
bible
to
be
the
work
of
a
merciful
father
and
the
only
way
to
find
out
is
to
read
it
and
a
very
few
people
do
read
it
now
i
will
read
a
few
passages
this
is
the
book
to
be
read
in
the
schools
in
order
to
make
our
children
charitable
and
good
this
is
the
book
that
we
must
read
in
order
that
our
children
may
have
ideas
of
mercy
charity
and
justice
does
the
bible
teach
mercy
now
be
honest
i
read
i
will
make
mine
arrows
drunk
with
blood
and
the
sword
shall
devour
flesh
deut
xxxii
pretty
good
start
for
a
merciful
god
that
thy
foot
may
be
dipped
in
the
blood
of
thine
enemies
and
the
tongue
of
thy
dogs
in
the
same
ps
lxviii
again
and
the
lord
thy
god
will
put
out
those
nations
before
thee
by
little
and
little
thou
mayest
not
consume
them
at
once
lest
the
beasts
of
the
field
increase
upon
thee
deut
vii
but
the
lord
thy
god
shall
deliver
them
unto
thee
and
shall
destroy
them
with
a
mighty
destruction
until
they
be
destroyed
and
he
shall
deliver
their
kings
into
thine
hand
and
thou
shalt
destroy
their
name
from
under
heaven
there
shall
no
man
be
able
to
stand
before
thee
until
thou
have
destroyed
them
deut
vii
so
joshua
came
and
all
the
people
of
war
with
him
against
them
by
waters
of
merom
suddenly
and
they
fell
upon
them
and
the
lord
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
israel
who
smote
them
and
chased
them
unto
great
zidon
and
unto
misrephothimaim
and
unto
the
valley
of
mizpeh
eastward
and
they
smote
them
until
they
left
them
none
remaining
and
joshua
did
unto
them
as
the
lord
bade
him
he
houghed
their
horses
and
burnt
their
chariots
with
fire
and
joshua
at
that
time
turned
back
and
took
hazor
and
smote
the
king
thereof
with
the
sword
for
hazor
beforetime
was
the
head
of
all
those
kingdoms
and
they
smote
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
utterly
destroying
them
there
was
not
any
left
to
breathe
and
he
burnt
hazor
with
fire
and
all
the
cities
of
those
kings
and
all
the
kings
of
them
did
joshua
take
and
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
he
utterly
destroyed
them
as
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
commanded
but
as
for
the
cities
that
stood
still
in
their
strength
israel
burnt
none
of
them
save
hazor
only
that
did
joshua
burn
and
all
the
spoil
of
these
cities
and
the
cattle
the
children
of
israel
took
for
a
prey
unto
themselves
but
every
man
they
smote
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
brave
until
they
had
destroyed
them
neither
left
they
any
to
breathe
as
the
moral
god
had
commanded
them
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
his
servant
so
did
moses
command
joshua
and
so
did
joshua
he
left
nothing
undone
of
all
that
the
lord
commanded
moses
so
joshua
took
all
that
land
the
hills
and
all
the
south
country
and
all
the
land
of
goshen
and
the
valley
of
the
same
even
from
the
mount
halak
that
goeth
up
to
seir
even
unto
baalgad
in
the
valley
of
lebanon
under
mount
hermon
and
all
their
kings
he
took
and
smote
them
and
slew
them
joshua
made
war
a
long
time
with
all
those
kings
there
was
not
a
city
that
made
peace
with
the
children
of
israel
save
the
hivites
the
inhabitants
of
gideon
all
other
they
took
in
battle
for
it
was
of
the
lord
to
harden
their
hearts
that
they
should
come
against
israel
in
battle
that
he
might
destroy
them
utterly
and
that
they
might
have
no
favor
but
that
he
might
destroy
them
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
and
at
that
time
came
joshua
and
cut
off
the
anakims
from
the
mountains
from
hebron
for
debit
from
anab
and
from
all
the
mountains
of
judah
and
from
all
the
mountains
of
israel
joshua
destroyed
them
utterly
with
their
cities
there
was
none
of
the
anakims
left
in
the
land
of
the
children
of
israel
only
in
gaza
in
gath
and
in
ashdod
there
remained
so
joshua
took
the
whole
land
according
to
all
that
the
lord
said
unto
moses
and
joshua
gave
it
for
an
inheritance
unto
israel
according
to
their
divisions
by
their
tribes
and
the
land
rested
from
war
josh
xi
to
when
thou
comest
nigh
unto
a
city
to
fight
against
it
then
proclaim
peace
unto
it
and
it
shall
be
if
it
make
thee
answer
of
peace
and
open
unto
thee
then
it
shall
be
that
all
the
people
that
is
found
therein
shall
be
tributaries
unto
thee
and
they
shall
serve
thee
and
if
it
will
make
no
peace
with
thee
but
will
make

thy

thus
shalt
thou
do
unto
all
the
cities
which
are
very
far
off

neither

smiling
upon

of

exod
xxxii
now
recollect
these
instructions
were
given
to
an
army
of
invasion
and
the
people
who
were
slayed
were
guilty
of
the
crime
of
fighting
for
their
homes
oh
most
merciful
god
the
old
testament
is
full
of
curses
vengeance
jealousy
and
hatred
and
of
barbarity
and
brutality
now
do
you
not
for
one
moment
believe
that
these
words
were
written
by
the
most
merciful
god
do
pluck
from
the
heart
the
sweet
flowers
of
piety
and
crush
them
by
superstition
do
not
believe
that
god
ever
ordered
the
murder
of
innocent
women
and
helpless
babes
do
not
let
this
supposition
turn
your
hearts
into
stone
when
anything
is
said
to
have
been
written
by
the
most
merciful
god
and
the
thing
is
not
merciful
then
i
deny
it
and
say
he
never
wrote
it
i
will
live
by
the
standard
of
reason
and
if
thinking
in
accordance
with
reason
takes
me
to
perdition
then
i
will
go
to
hell
with
my
reason
rather
that
to
heaven
without
it
now
does
this
bible
teach
political
freedom
or
does
it
teach
political
tyranny
does
it
teach
a
man
to
resist
oppression
does
it
teach
a
man
to
tear
from
the
throne
of
tyranny
the
crowned
thing
and
robber
called
a
king
let
us
see
reading
let
every
soul
be
subject
to
the
higher
powers
for
there
is
no
power
but
of
god
the
powers
that
are
ordained
of
god
rom
xii
all
the
kings
and
princes
and
governors
and
thieves
and
robbers
that
happened
to
be
in
authority
were
placed
there
by
the
infinite
father
of
all
whosoever
therefore
resisteth
the
power
resisteth
the
ordinance
of
god
and
when
george
washington
resisted
the
power
of
george
the
third
he
resisted
the
power
of
god
and
when
our
fathers
said
resistance
to
tyrants
is
obedience
to
god
they
falsified
the
bible
itself
for
he
is
the
minister
of
god
to
thee
for
good
but
if
thou
do
that
which
is
evil
be
afraid
for
he
beareth
not
the
sword
in
vain
for
he
is
the
minister
of
god
revenger
to
execute
wrath
upon
him
that
doeth
evil
wherefore
ye
must
needs
be
subject
not
only
for
wrath
but
also
for
conscience
sake
rom
xiii
i
deny
this
wretched
doctrine
wherever
the
sword
of
rebellion
is
drawn
to
protect
the
rights
of
man
i
am
a
rebel
wherever
the
sword
of
rebellion
is
drawn
to
give
man
liberty
to
clothe
him
in
all
his
just
rights
i
am
on
the
side
of
that
rebellion
i
deny
that
the
rulers
are
crowned
by
the
most
high
the
rulers
are
the
people
and
the
presidents
and
others
are
but
the
servants
of
the
people
all
authority
comes
from
the
people
and
not
from
the
aristocracy
of
the
air
upon
these
texts
of
scripture
which
i
have
just
read
rest
the
thrones
of
europe
and
these
are
the
voices
that
are
repeated
from
age
to
age
by
brainless
kings
and
heartless
kings
does
the
bible
give
woman
her
rights
is
this
bible
humane
does
it
treat
woman
as
she
ought
to
be
treated
or
is
it
barbarian
let
us
see
let
the
woman
learn
in
silence
with
all
subjection
timothy
ii
if
a
woman
would
know
anything
let
her
ask
her
husband
imagine
the
ignorance
of
a
lady
who
had
only
that
source
of
information
but
i
suffer
not
a
woman
to
teach
not
to
usurp
authority
over
the
man
but
to
be
in
silence
for
adam
was
first
formed
then
eve
what
magnificent
reason
and
adam
was
not
deceived
but
the
woman
being
deceived
was
in
the
transgression
splendid
but
i
would
have
you
know
that
the
head
of
every
man
is
christ
and
the
head
of
the
woman
is
the
man
and
the
head
of
christ
is
god
that
is
to
say
there
is
as
much
difference
between
the
woman
and
man
as
there
is
between
christ
and
man
this
is
the
liberty
of
woman
for
the
man
is
not
of
the
woman
but
the
woman
is
of
the
man
it
was
the
man
cut
till
that
was
taken
not
the
woman
neither
was
the
man
created
for
the
woman
well
what
was
he
created
for
but
the
woman
was
created
for
the
man
wives
submit
yourselves
unto
your
husbands
as
unto
the
lord
there
liberty
for
the
husband
is
the
head
of
the
wife
even
as
christ
is
the
head
of
the
church
and
he
is
the
savior
of
the
body
therefore
as
the
church
is
subject
unto
christ
so
let
the
wives
be
to
their
own
husbands
in
everything
good
again
even
the
savior
did
put
man
and
woman
upon
an
equality
the
man
could
divorce
the
wife
but
the
wife
could
not
divorce
the
husband
and
according
to
the
old
testament
the
mother
had
to
ask
for
forgiveness
for
being
the
mother
of
babes
splendid
here
is
something
from
the
old
testament
when
thou
goest
forth
to
war
against
thine
enemies
and
the
lord
thy
god
hath
delivered
them
into
thine
hands
and
thou
has
taken
them
captive
and
seest
among
the
captives
a
beautiful
woman
and
has
a
desire
unto
her
that
thou
wouldst
have
her
to
thy
wife
then
thou
shalt
bring
her
home
to
thine
house
and
she
shall
shave
her
head
and
pare
her
nails
deut
xxi
that
is
in
i
suppose
this
sacred
book
this
foundation
of
human
liberty
of
morality
does
it
teach
concubinage
and
polygamy
read
the
chapter
of
numbers
read
the
chapter
of
deuteronomy
read
the
blessed
lives
of
abraham
of
david
or
of
solomon
and
then
tell
me
that
the
sacred
scripture
does
not
teach
polygamy
and
concubinage
all
the
language
of
the
world
is
not
sufficient
to
express
the
infamy
of
polygamy
it
makes
man
a
beast
and
woman
a
stone
it
destroys
the
fireside
and
makes
virtue
an
outcast
and
yet
it
is
the
doctrine
of
the
bible
the
doctrine
defended
by
luther
and
melanchthon
it
takes
from
our
language
those
sweetest
words
father
husband
wife
and
mother
and
takes
us
back
to
barbarism
and
fills
our
hearts
with
the
crawling
slimy
serpents
of
loathsome
lust
does
the
bible
teach
the
existence
of
devils
of
course
it
does
yes
it
teaches
not
only
the
existence
of
a
good
being
but
a
bad
being
this
good
being
had
to
have
a
home
that
home
was
heaven
this
bad
being
had
to
have
a
home
and
that
home
was
hell
this
hell
is
supposed
to
be
nearer
to
earth
than
i
would
care
to
have
it
and
to
be
peopled
with
spirits
spooks
hobgoblins
and
all
the
fiery
shapes
with
which
the
imagination
of
ignorance
and
fear
could
people
that
horrible
place
and
the
bible
teaches
the
existence
of
hell
and
this
big
devil
and
all
these
little
devils
the
bible
teaches
the
doctrine
of
witchcraft
and
makes
us
believe
that
there
are
sorcerers
and
witches
and
that
the
dead
could
be
raised
by
the
power
of
sorcery
does
anybody
believe
it
now
then
said
saul
unto
his
servants
seek
me
a
woman
that
hath
a
familiar
spirit
that
i
may
go
to
her
and
inquire
of
her
and
his
servants
said
to
him
behold
there
is
a
woman
that
hath
a
familiar
spirit
at
endor
and
saul
disguised
himself
and
put
on
other
raiment
and
he
went
and
two
men
with
him
and
they
came
to
the
woman
by
night
and
he
said
i
pray
thee
divine
unto
me
by
the
familiar
spirit
and
bring
me
him
up
whom
i
shall
name
unto
thee
that
was
a
pretty
good
spiritual
seance
and
the
woman
said
unto
him
behold
thou
knowest
what
saul
hath
done
how
he
hath
cut
off
those
that
have
familiar
spirits
and
the
wizards
out
of
the
land
wherefore
then
layest
thou
a
snare
for
my
life
to
cause
me
to
die
and
saul
sware
to
her
by
the
lord
saying
as
the
lord
liveth
there
shall
no
punishment
happen
to
thee
for
this
thing
then
said
the
woman
whom
shall
i
bring
up
unto
thee
and
he
said
bring
me
up
samuel
and
when
the
woman
saw
samuel
she
cried
with
a
loud
voice
and
the
woman
spake
to
saul
saying
why
hast
thou
deceived
me
for
thou
art
saul
and
the
king
said
unto
her
be
not
afraid
for
what
sawest
thou
and
the
woman
said
unto
saul
i
saw
gods
ascending
out
of
the
earth
and
he
said
unto
her
what
form
is
he
of
and
she
said
an
old
man
cometh
up
and
he
is
covered
with
a
mantle
and
saul
perceived
that
it
was
samuel
and
he
stooped
with
his
face
to
the
ground
and
bowed
himself
saml
xxviii
in
another
place
he
declares
that
witchcraft
is
an
abomination
unto
the
lord
he
wanted
no
rivals
in
this
business
now
what
does
the
new
testament
teach
then
was
jesus
led
up
of
the
spirit
into
the
wilderness
to
be
tempted
of
the
devil
and
when
he
had
fasted
forty
days
and
forty
nights
he
was
afterward
an
hungered
sic
and
when
the
tempter
came
to
him
he
said
if
thou
be
the
son
of
god
command
that
these
stones
be
made
bread
but
he
answered
and
said
it
is
written
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
god
then
the
devil
taketh
him
up
into
the
holy
city
and
setteth
him
on
a
pinnacle
of
the
temple
and
saith
unto
him
if
thou
be
the
son
of
god
hell
cast
thyself
down
for
it
is
written
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
concerning
thee
and
in
their
hands
they
shall
bear
thee
up
lest
at
any
time
thou
dash
thy
foot
against
a
stone
jesus
said
unto
him
it
is
written
again
thou
shalt
not
tempt
the
lord
thy
god
matt
iv
is
it
possible
that
anyone
can
believe
that
the
devil
absolutely
took
god
almighty
and
put
him
on
the
pinnacle
of
the
temple
and
endeavored
to
persuade
him
to
jump
down
is
it
possible
again
the
devil
taketh
him
up
into
an
exceeding
high
mountain
and
showeth
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
and
the
glory
of
them
and
saith
unto
him
all
these
things
will
i
give
thee
if
thou
will
fall
down
and
worship
me
then
saith
jesus
unto
him
get
thee
hence
satan
for
it
is
written
thou
shalt
worship
the
lord
thy
god
and
him
only
shalt
thou
serve
matt
iv
now
the
devil
must
have
known
at
that
time
that
he
was
god
and
god
at
that
time
must
have
known
that
the
other
was
the
devil
how
could
the
latter
be
conceived
to
have
the
impudence
to
promise
god
a
world
in
which
he
did
not
have
a
to
an
inch
of
land
then
the
devil
leaveth
him
and
behold
angels
came
and
ministered
unto
him
matt
iv
and
they
came
over
unto
the
other
side
of
the
sea
into
the
country
of
the
gadarines
and
when
he
was
come
out
of
the
ship
immediately
there
met
him
out
of
the
tombs
a
man
with
an
unclean
spirit
who
had
his
dwelling
among
the
tombs
and
no
man
could
bind
him
no
not
with
chains
because
that
he
had
been
often
bound
with
fetters
and
chains
and
the
chains
had
been
plucked
asunder
by
him
and
the
fetters
broken
in
pieces
neither
could
any
man
tame
him
and
always
night
and
day
he
was
in
the
mountains
and
tombs
crying
and
cutting
himself
with
stones
but
when
he
saw
jesus
afar
off
he
came
and
worshiped
him
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
and
said
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
jesus
thou
son
of
the
most
high
god
i
adjure
thee
by
god
that
thou
torment
me
not
for
he
said
unto
him
come
out
of
the
man
thou
unclean
spirit
and
he
asked
him
what
is
thy
name
and
he
answered
saying
my
name
is
legion
for
we
are
many
and
he
besought
him
much
that
he
would
not
send
them
away
out
of
the
country
now
there
was
there
nigh
unto
the
mountains
a
great
herd
of
swine
feeding
and
all
the
devils
besought
him
saying
send
us
into
the
swine
that
we
may
enter
into
them
and
forthwith
jesus
gave
them
leave
and
the
unclean
spirits
went
out
and
entered
into
the
swine
and
the
herd
ran
violently
down
a
steep
place
into
the
sea
they
were
about
two
thousand
and
were
choked
in
the
sea
mark
v
now
i
will
ask
a
question
should
reasonable
men
in
the
nineteenth
century
in
the
united
states
of
america
believe
that
that
was
an
actual
occurrence
if
my
salvation
depends
upon
believing
that
i
am
lost
i
have
never
experienced
the
signs
by
which
it
is
said
a
believer
may
be
known
i
deny
all
the
witch
stories
in
this
world
these
fables
of
devils
have
covered
the
world
with
blood
they
have
filled
the
world
with
fear
and
i
am
going
to
do
what
i
can
to
free
the
world
of
these
insatiate
monsters
small
and
great
they
have
filled
the
world
with
monsters
they
have
made
the
world
a
synonym
of
liar
and
ferocity
and
it
is
this
book
that
ought
to
be
read
in
all
the
schools
this
book
that
teaches
man
to
enslave
his
brother
if
it
is
larceny
to
steal
the
result
of
labor
how
much
more
is
it
larceny
to
steal
the
laborer
himself
moreover
of
the
children
of
the
strangers
that
do
sojourn
among
you
of
them
shall
ye
buy
and
of
their
families
that
are
with
you
which
they
begat
in
your
land
and
they
shall
be
your
possession
and
ye
shall
take
them
as
an
inheritance
for
your
children
after
you
to
inherit
them
for
a
possession
they
shall
be
your
bondmen
forever
but
over
your
brethren
the
children
of
israel
ye
shall
not
rule
one
over
another
with
rigor
lev
xxv
why
because
they
are
not
as
good
as
you
will
buy
of
the
heathen
roundabout
now
these
are
the
judgments
which
thou
shalt
set
before
them
if
thou
buy
an
hebrew
servant
six
years
he
shall
serve
and
in
the
seventh
he
shall
go
out
free
for
nothing
if
he
came
in
by
himself
he
shall
go
out
by
himself
if
he
were
married
then
his
wife
shall
go
out
with
him
if
his
master
have
given
him
a
wife
and
she
have
borne
him
sons
or
daughters
the
wife
and
her
children
shall
be
her
master
and
he
shall
go
out
by
himself
and
if
the
servant
shall
plainly
say
i
love
my
master
my
wife
and
my
children
i
will
not
go
out
free
then
his
master
shall
bring
him
unto
the
judges
he
shall
also
bring
him
to
the
door
or
unto
the
and
his
master
shall

this

so
that

will
love

what
does
this

say

of
little

let
us
see
how
they
are
treated
by
the

if
a

have
a
stubborn
and
rebellious
son
which
will
not

that
when
they
have
chastened
him

shall
his

lay
hold

bring
him
out

this

he
is

all

abraham
was
commanded
to
offer
his
son
isaac
as
a
sacrifice
and
he
intended
to
obey
the
boy
was
not
consulted
did
you
ever
hear
the
story
of
jephthah
daughter
returning
him
jephthah
said
and
jephthah
vowed
a
vow
unto
the
lord
and
said
if
thou
shalt
without
fail
deliver
the
children
of
ammon
into
mine
hands
then
it
shall
be
that
whatsoever
cometh
forth
of
the
doors
of
my
house
to
meet
me
when
i
return
in
peace
from
the
children
of
ammon
shall
surely
be
the
lord
and
i
will
offer
it
up
for
a
burnt
offering
so
jephthah
passed
over
unto
the
children
of
ammon
to
fight
against
them
and
the
lord
delivered
them
into
his
hands
and
he
smote
them
from
aroer
even
till
thou
come
to
minnith
even
twenty
cities
and
unto
the
plain
of
the
vineyards
with
a
very
great
slaughter
thus
the
children
of
ammon
were
subdued
before
the
children
of
israel
and
jephthah
came
to
mizpeh
unto
his
house
and
behold
his
daughter
came
out
to
meet
him
with
timbrels
and
with
dances
and
she
was
his
only
child
besides
her
he
had
neither
son
nor
daughter
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
saw
her
that
he
rent
his
clothes
and
said
alas
my
daughter
thou
has
brought
me
very
low
and
thou
art
one
of
them
that
trouble
me
for
i
have
opened
my
mouth
unto
the
lord
and
i
can
not
go
back
and
she
said
unto
him
my
father
if
thou
has
opened
thy
mouth
unto
the
lord
do
to
me
according
to
that
which
hath
proceeded
out
of
thy
mouth
forasmuch
as
the
lord
hath
taken
vengeance
for
thee
of
thine
enemies
even
to
the
children
of
ammon
and
she
said
unto
her
father
let
this
thing
be
done
for
me
let
me
alone
two
months
that
i
may
go
up
and
down
upon
the
mountains
and
bewail
my
virginity
i
and
my
fellows
and
he
said
go
and
he
sent
her
away
for
two
months
and
she
went
with
her
companions
and
bewailed
her
virginity
upon
the
mountains
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
two
months
that
she
returned
unto
her
father
who
did
with
her
according
to
his
vow
which
he
had
vowed
is
there
in
the
history
of
the
world
a
sadder
story
than
this
can
a
god
who
would
accept
such
a
sacrifice
be
worthy
of
the
worship
of
civilized
men
i
believe
in
the
rights
of
children
i
plead
for
the
republic
of
home
for
the
democracy
of
the
fireside
and
for
this
i
am
called
a
heathen
and
a
devil
by
those
who
believe
in
the
cheerful
and
comforting
doctrine
of
eternal
damnation
read
the
book
of
job
read
that
god
met
the
devil
and
asked
him
where
he
had
been
and
he
said
walking
up
and
down
the
country
and
the
lord
said
to
him
have
you
noticed
my
man
job
over
here
how
good
he
is
and
the
devil
said
of
course
he
good
you
give
him
everything
he
wants
just
take
away
his
property
and
he
curse
you
you
just
try
it
and
he
did
try
it
and
took
away
his
goods
but
job
still
remained
good
the
devil
laughed
and
said
that
he
had
not
been
tried
enough
then
the
lord
touched
his
flesh
but
he
was
still
true
then
he
took
away
his
children
but
he
remained
faithful
and
in
the
end
to
show
how
much
job
made
by
his
fidelity
his
property
was
all
doubled
and
he
had
more
children
than
ever
if
you
have
a
child
and
you
love
it
would
you
be
satisfied
with
a
god
who
would
destroy
it
and
endeavor
to
make
it
up
by
giving
you
another
that
was
better
looking
no
you
want
that
one
you
want
no
other
and
yet
this
is
the
idea
of
the
love
of
children
taught
in
the
bible
does
the
bible
teach
you
freedom
of
religion
to
day
we
say
that
every
man
has
a
right
to
worship
god
or
not
to
worship
him
as
he
pleases

it
the
doctrine
of

put
him
to

afterwards
the
hand
of
all
the
people

him

i
hate

i
have

thou
hast
heard
of
it
and
inquired
diligently
and
behold
it
be
true
and
the
thing
certain
that
such
abomination
is
wrought
in

then
shalt
thou
bring
forth
that
man
or
that
woman
which
have
committed
that
wicked
thing
unto
thy
gates
even
that
man

stone
them

xvii
that
is
the
religious
liberty
of
the
bible
that
it
and
this
god
taught
that
doctrine
to
the
jews
and
said
to
them
any
one
that
teaches
a
different
religion
kill
him
now
let
me
ask
and
i
want
to
do
it
reverently
if
as
is
contended
god
gave
these
frightful
laws
to
the
flesh
and
come
among
the
jews
and
taught
a
different
religion
and
these
jews
in
accordance
with
the
laws
which
this
same
god
gave
them
crucified
him
did
he
not
reap
what
he
had
sown
the
mercy
of
all
this
comes
in
what
is
called
the
plan
of
salvation
what
is
that
plan
according
to
this
great
plan
the
innocent
suffer
for
the
guilty
to
satisfy
a
law
what
sort
of
a
law
must
it
be
that
would
be
satisfied
with
the
suffering
of
innocence
according
to
this
plan
the
salvation
of
the
whole
world
depends
upon
the
bigotry
of
the
jews
and
the
treachery
of
judas
according
to
the
same
plan
we
all
would
have
gone
to
eternal
hell
according
to
the
same
plan
there
would
have
been
no
death
in
the
world
if
there
had
been
no
sin
and
if
there
had
been
no
death
you
and
i
would
not
have
been
called
into
existence
and
if
we
did
not
exist
we
could
not
have
been
saved
so
we
owe
our
salvation
to
the
bigotry
of
the
jews
and
the
treachery
of
judas
and
we
are
indebted
to
the
devil
for
our
existence
i
speak
this
reverently
it
strikes
me
that
what
they
call
the
atonement
is
a
kind
of
moral
bankruptcy
under
its
merciful
provisions
man
is
allowed
the
privilege
of
sinning
credit
and
whenever
he
is
guilty
of
a
mean
action
he
says
charge
it
in
my
judgment
this
kind
of
bookkeeping
breeds
extravagance
in
sin
suppose
we
had
a
law
in
new
york
that
every
merchant
should
give
credit
to
every
man
who
asked
it
under
pain
and
penitentiary
and
that
every
man
should
take
the
benefit
of
the
bankruptcy
statute
any
saturday
night
does
the
credit
system
in
morals
breed
extravagance
in
sin
the
question
who
afraid
of
punishment
which
is
so
far
away
whom
does
the
doctrine
of
hell
stop
the
great
the
rich
the
powerful
no
the
poor
the
weak
the
despised
the
mean
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
man
going
to
hell
who
died
in
new
york
worth
a
million
of
dollars
or
with
an
income
of
thousand
a
year
did
you
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
man
going
to
hell
who
rode
in
a
carriage
never
they
are
the
gentlemen
who
talk
about
their
assets
and
who
say
hell
is
not
for
me
it
is
for
the
poor
i
have
all
the
luxuries
i
want
give
that
to
the
poor
who
goes
to
hell
tramps
let
me
tell
you
a
story
there
was
once
a
frightful
rain
and
all
the
animals
held
a
convention
to
see
whose
fault
it
was
and
the
fox
nominated
the
lion
for
chairman
the
wolf
seconded
the
motion
and
the
hyena
said
that
suits
when
the
convention
was
called
to
order
the
fox
was
called
upon
to
confess
his
sins
he
stated
however
that
it
would
be
much
more
appropriate
for
the
lion
to
commence
first
thereupon
the
lion
said
i
am
not
conscious
of
having
committed
evil
it
is
true
i
have
devoured
a
few
men
but
for
what
other
purpose
were
men
made
and
they
all
cheered
and
were
satisfied
the
fox
gave
his
views
upon
the
goose
question
and
the
wolf
admitted
that
he
had
devoured
sheep
and
occasionally
had
killed
a
shepherd
but
all
acquainted
with
the
history
of
my
family
will
bear
me
out
when
i
say
that
shepherds
have
been
the
enemies
of
my
family
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
then
way
in
the
rear
there
arose
a
simple
donkey
with
a
kind
of
abrahamic
countenance
he
said
i
expect
it
me
i
had
eaten
nothing
for
three
days
except
three
thistles
i
was
passing
a
monastery
the
monks
were
at
mass
the
gates
were
open
leading
to
a
yard
full
of
sweet
clover
i
knew
it
was
wrong
but
i
did
slip
in
and
i
took
a
mouthful
but
my
conscience
smote
me
and
i
went
out
and
all
the
animals
shouted
he
the
fellow
and
in
two
minutes
they
had
his
hide
on
the
fence
that
the
kind
of
people
that
go
to
hell
now
this
doctrine
of
hell
that
has
been
such
a
comfort
to
my
race
which
so
many
ministers
are
pleading
for
has
been
defended
for
ages
by
the
fathers
of
the
church
your
preacher
says
that
the
sovereignty
of
god
implies
that
he
has
an
absolute
unlimited
and
independent
right
to
dispose
of
his
creatures
as
he
will
because
he
made
them
has
he
suppose
i
take
this
book
and
change
it
immediately
into
a
servient
human
being
would
i
have
a
right
to
torture
it
because
i
made
it
no
on
the
contrary
i
would
say
having
brought
you
into
existence
it
is
my
duty
to
do
the
best
for
you
i
can
they
say
god
has
a
right
to
damn
me
because
he
made
me
i
deny
it
another
one
says
god
is
not
obliged
to
save
even
those
who
believe
in
christ
and
that
he
can
either
bestow
salvation
upon
his
children
or
retain
it
without
any
diminution
of
his
glory
another
one
says
god
may
save
any
sinner
whatsoever
consistently
with
his
justice
let
a
natural
person
and
i
claim
to
be
one
moral
or
immoral
wise
or
unwise
let
him
be
as
just
as
he
can
no
matter
what
his
prayers
may
be
what
pains
he
may
have
taken
to
be
saved
or
whatever
circumstances
he
may
be
in
god
according
to
this
writer
can
deny
him
salvation
without
the
least
disparagement
of
his
glory
his
glories
will
not
be
in
the
least
obscured
there
is
no
natural
man
be
his
character
what
it
may
but
god
may
cast
down
to
hell
without
being
charged
with
unfair
dealing
in
any
respect
with
regard
to
that
man
theologians
tell
us
that
god
design
in
the
creation
was
simply
to
glorify
himself
magnificent
object
the
same
shall
drink
of
the
wine
of
the
wrath
of
god
which
is
poured
out
without
mixture
into
the
cup
of
his
indignation
and
he
shall
be
tormented
with
fire
and
brimstone
in
the
presence
of
the
holy
angels
and
in
the
presence

do
you
know
nobody
would
have
had
an
idea
of
hell
in
this
world
if
it
had
been
for
volcanoes
they
were
looked
upon
as
the
chimneys
of
hell
the
idea
of
eternal
fire
never
would
have
polluted
the
imagination
of
man
but
for
them
an
eminent
theologian
describing
hell
says
there
is
no
recounting
the
millions
of
ages
the
damned
shall
suffer
all
arithmetic
ends
here
and
all
sense
too
they
shall
have
nothing
to
do
in
passing
away
this
eternity
but
to
conflict
with
torments
god
shall
have
no
other
use
or
employment
for
them
these
words
were
said
by
gentlemen
who
died
christians
and
who
are
now
in
the
harp
business
in
the
world
to
come
another
declares
there
is
nothing
to
keep
any
man
or
christian
out
of
hell
except
the
mere
pleasure
of
god
and
their
pains
never
grow
any
easier
by
their
becoming
accustomed
to
them
it
is
also
declared
that
the
devil
goes
about
like
a
lion
ready
to
doom
the
wicked
did
it
never
occur
to
you
what
a
contradiction
it
is
to
say
that
the
devil
will
persecute
his
own
friends
he
wants
all
the
recruits
he
can
get
why
then
should
he
persecute
his
friends
in
my
judgment
he
should
give
them
the
best
hell
affords
it
is
in
the
very
nature
of
things
that
torments
inflicted
have
no
tendency
to
bring
a
wicked
man
to
repentance
then
why
torment
him
if
it
will
not
do
him
good
it
is
simply
unadulterated
revenge
all
the
punishment
in
the
world
will
not
reform
a
man
unless
he
knows
that
he
who
inflicts
it
upon
him
does
it
for
the
sake
of
reformation
and
really
and
truly
loves
him
and
has
his
good
at
heart
punishment
inflicted
for
gratifying
the
appetite
makes
man
afraid
but
debases
him
various
reasons
are
given
for
punishing
the
wicked
first
that
god
will
vindicate
his
injured
majesty
well
i
am
glad
of
that
second
he
will
glorify
his
justice
think
of
that
third
he
will
show
and
glorify
his
grace
every
time
the
saved
shall
look
upon
the
damned
in
hell
it
will
cause
in
them
a
lively
and
admiring
sense
of
the
grace
of
god
every
look
upon
the
damned
will
double
the
ardor
and
the
joy
of
the
saints
in
heaven
can
the
believing
husband
in
heaven
look
down
upon
the
torments
of
the
unbelieving
wife
in
hell
and
then
feel
a
thrill
of
joy
that
the
old
doctrine
not
of
our
days
we
are
too
civilized
for
that
o
but
it
is
the
doctrine
that
if
you
saw
your
wife
in
hell
the
wife
you
love
who
in
your
last
sickness
nursed
you
that
perhaps
supported
you
by
her
needle
when
you
were
ill
the
wife
who
watched
by
your
couch
night
and
day
and
held
your
corpse
in
her
loving
arms
when
you
were
dead
the
sight
would
give
you
great
joy
that
doctrine
is
not
preached
they
do
not
preach
that
the
sight
would
give
you
joy
but
they
do
preach
that
it
will
not
diminish
your
happiness
that
is
the
doctrine
of
every
orthodox
minister
in
new
york
and
i
repeat
that
i
have
no
respect
for
men
who
preach
such
doctrines
the
sight
of
the
torments
of
the
damned
in
hell
will
increase
the
ecstasy
of
the
saints
forever
on
this
principle
man
never
enjoys
a
good
dinner
so
much
as
when
a
is
dying
of
famine
before
his
eyes
or
he
never
enjoys
the
cheerful
warmth
of
his
own
fireside
so
greatly
as
when
a
poor
and
abandoned
wretch
is
dying
on
his
doorstep
the
saints
enjoy
the
ecstasy
and
the
groans
of
the
tormented
are
music
to
them
i
say
here
that
you
can
not
commit
a
sin
against
an
infinite
being
i
can
sin
against
my
brother
or
my
neighbor
because
i
can
injure
them
there
can
be
no
sin
where
there
is
no
injury
neither
can
a
finite
being
commit
infinite
sin
an
old
saint
believed
that
hell
was
in
the
interior
of
the
earth
and
that
the
rotation
of
the
earth
was
caused
by
the
souls
trying
to
get
away
from
the
fire
the
old
church
at
home
in
adorned
with
pictures
of
hell
and
the
like
one
of
the
pictures
represents
resurrection
morning
people
are
getting
out
of
their
graves
and
devils
are
catching
hold
of
their
heels
in
one
place
there
is
a
huge
brass
monster
and
devils
are
driving
scores
of
lost
souls
into
his
mouth
over
hot
fires
hang
caldrons
with
fifty
or
sixty
people
in
each
and
devils
are
poking
the
fires
people
are
hung
up
on
hooks
by
their
tongues
and
devils
are
lashing
them
up
in
the
right
hand
corner
are
some
of
the
saved
with
grins
on
their
faces
stretching
from
ear
to
ear
they
seem
to
say
aha
what
did
i
tell
you
some
of
the
old
saints
gentlemen
who
died
in
the
odor
of
sanctity
and
are
now
in
the
harp
business
insisted
that
heaven
and
hell
would
be
plainly
in
view
of
each
other
only
a
few
years
ago
rev
furness
an
appropriate
name
published
a
little
pamphlet
called
a
sight
in
hell
i
remember
when
i
first
read
that
my
little
child
seven
years
old
was
ill
and
in
bed
i
thought
she
would
not
hear
me
and
i
read
some
of
it
aloud
she
arose
and
asked
who
says
that
i
answered
that
what
they
preach
in
some
of
the
churches
i
never
will
enter
a
church
as
long
as
i
live
she
said
and
she
never
has
the
doctrine
of
orthodox
christianity
is
that
the
damned
shall
suffer
torment
forever
and
forever
and
if
you
were
a
wanderer
footsore
weary
with
parched
tongue
dying
for
a
drop
of
water
and
you
met
one
who
divided
his
poor
portion
with
you
and
died
as
he
saw
you
reviving
if
he
was
an
unbeliever
and
you
a
believer
and
you
died
and
went
to
heaven
and
he
called
to
you
from
hell
for
a
draught
of
water
it
would
be
your
duty
to
laugh
at
him
rev
spurgeon
says
that
everywhere
in
hell
will
be
written
the
words
for
ever
they
will
be
branded
on
every
wave
of
flame
they
will
be
forged
in
every
link
of
every
chain
they
will
be
seen
in
every
lurid
flash
of
brimstone
everywhere
will
be
those
words
for
ever
everybody
will
be
yelling
and
screaming
them
just
think
of
that
picture
of
the
mercy
and
justice
of
the
eternal
father
of
us
all
if
these
words
are
necessary
why
are
they
not
written
now
everywhere
in
the
world
on
every
tree
and
every
field
and
on
every
blade
of
grass
i
say
i
am
entitled
to
have
it
so
i
say
that
it
is
god
duty
to
furnish
me
with
the
evidence
here
is
another
good
book
read
in
every
a
splendid
book
pollok
course
of
time
every
copy
in
the
world
of
such
books
as
that
ought
to
be
burned
well
the
author
pretends
to
have
gone
to
hell
and
i
think
that
he
ought
to
have
stopped
there
the
lecturer
read
the
passage
from
the
work
descriptive
of
the
torments
of
the
damned
and
proceeded
and
that
book
is
put
into
the
hands
of
children
in
order
that
they
may
love
and
worship
the
most
merciful
god
in
old
time
they
had
to
find
a
place
for
hell
and
they
found
a
hundred
places
for
it
one
says
that
it
was
under
lake
avernus
but
the
christians
thought
differently
one
divine
tells
us
that
it
must
be
below
the
earth
because
christ
descended
into
hell
another
gives
it
as
his
opinion
that
hell
is
in
the
sun
and
he
tells
us
that
nobody
without
an
express
revelation
from
god
can
prove
that
it
is
not
there
most
likely
well
he
had
the
idea
at
all
events
of
utilizing
the
damned
as
fuel
to
warm
the
earth
but
i
will
quote
from
another
poet
if
it
is
lawful
to
call
him
a
poet
i
mean
tupper
colonel
ingersoll
quoted
from
that
orthodox
author
and
continued
another
divine
preached
a
sermon
no
further
back
than
in
which
he
said
that
the
damned
will
grow
worse
and
the
same
divine
says
that
the
devil
was
the
first
universalist
then
i
am
on
the
side
of
the
devil
the
fact
is
that
you
have
got
not
merely
to
believe
the
bible
but
you
must
also
believe
in
a
certain
interpretation
of
it
and
mind
you
you
must
also
believe
in
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
i
want
to
explain
what
that
is
so
that
you
may
never
have
an
excuse
for
not
knowing
it
i
quote
from
the
best
theologian
that
ever
wrote
then
he
went
on
to
give
in
substance
the
athanasian
definition
of
the
trinity
winding
up
with
a
long
string
of
adjectives
culminating
in
the
description
entirely
incomprehensible
if
you
do
understand
it
after
that
it
is
you
own
fault
now
you
must
believe
in
that
doctrine
if
you
do
not
all
the
orthodox
churches
agree
in
condemning
you
to
everlasting
flames
we
have
got
to
burn
through
all
our
lives
simply
with
the
view
of
making
them
happy
we
are
taught
to
love
our
enemies
to
pray
for
those
that
persecute
us
to
forgive
should
not
the
merciful
god
practice
what
he
preaches
i
say
that
reverently
why
should
he
say
forgive
your
enemies
if
he
will
not
himself
forgive
why
should
he
say
pray
for
those
that
despise
and
persecute
you
but
if
they
refuse
to
believe
his
doctrine
he
will
burn
them
forever
i
can
not
believe
it
here
is
a
little
child
residing
in
the
purlieus
of
the
city
some
boy
who
is
taught
that
it
is
his
duty
to
steal
by
his
mother
who
applauds
his
success
and
pats
him
on
the
head
and
calls
him
a
good
boy
would
it
be
just
to
condemn
him
to
an
eternity
of
torture
suppose
there
is
a
god
let
us
bring
to
this
question
some
common
sense
i
care
nothing
about
the
doctrines
of
religions
or
creeds
of
the
past
let
us
come
to
the
bar
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
judge
matter
by
what
we
know
by
what
we
think
by
what
we
love
but
they
say
to
us
if
you
throw
away
the
bible
what
are
we
to
depend
on
then
but
no
two
persons
in
the
world
agree
as
to
what
the
bible
is
what
they
are
to
believe
or
what
they
are
not
to
believe
it
is
like
a
guidepost
that
has
been
thrown
down
in
some
time
of
disaster
and
has
been
put
up
the
wrong
way
nobody
can
accept
its
guidance
for
nobody
knows
where
it
would
direct
him
i
say
tear
down
the
useless
guidepost
but
they
answer
oh
do
not
do
that
or
we
will
have
nothing
to
go
by
i
would
say
old
church
you
take
that
road
and
i
will
take
this
another
minister
has
said
that
the
bible
is
the
great
at
which
we
all
may
set
our
watches
but
i
have
said
to
a
friend
of
that
minister
suppose
we
all
should
set
our
watches
by
that
there
would
be
many
persons
to
tell
you
that
in
old
times
the
long
hand
was
the
hour
hand
and
besides
the
clock
has
been
wound
up
for
a
long
time
i
say
let
us
wait
till
the
sun
rises
and
set
our
watches
by
nature
for
my
part
i
am
willing
to
give
up
heaven
to
get
rid
of
hell
i
had
rather
there
should
be
no
heaven
than
that
any
solitary
soul
should
be
condemned
to
suffer
forever
and
ever
but
they
tell
me
that
the
bible
is
the
good
book
now
in
the
old
testament
there
is
not
in
my
judgment
a
single
reference
to
another
life
is
there
a
burial
service
mentioned
in
it
in
which
a
word
of
hope
is
spoken
at
the
grave
of
the
dead
the
idea
of
eternal
life
was
not
born
of
any
book
that
wave
of
hope
and
joy
ebbs
and
flows
and
will
continue
to
ebb
and
flow
as
long
as
love
kisses
the
lips
of
death
let
me
tell
you
a
tale
of
the
persian
religion
of
a
man
who
having
done
good
for
long
years
of
his
life
presented
himself
at
the
gates
of
paradise
but
the
gates
remained
closed
against
him
he
went
back
and
followed
up
his
good
works
for
seven
years
longer
and
the
gates
of
paradise
still
remaining
shut
against
him
he
toiled
in
works
of
charity
until
at
last
they
were
opened
unto
him
think
of
that
pursued
the
lecturer
and
send
out
your
missionaries
among
those
people
there
is
no
religion
but
goodness
but
justice
but
charity
religion
is
not
theory
it
is
life
it
is
not
intellectual
conviction
it
is
divine
humanity
and
nothing
else
colonel
ingersoll
here
told
another
tale
from
the
hindoo
of
a
man
who
refused
to
enter
paradise
without
a
faithful
dog
urging
that
ingratitude
was
the
blackest
of
all
sins
and
the
god
he
said
admitted
him
dog
and
all
compare
that
religion
with
the
orthodox
tenets
of
the
city
of
new
york
there
is
a
prayer
which
every
brahmin
prays
in
which
he
declares
that
he
will
never
enter
into
a
final
state
of
bliss
alone
but
that
everywhere
he
will
strive
for
universal
redemption
that
never
will
he
leave
the
world
of
sin
and
sorrow
but
remain
suffering
and
striving
and
sorrowing
after
universal
salvation
compare
that
with
the
orthodox
idea
and
send
out
your
missionaries
to
the
benighted
hindoos
the
doctrine
of
hell
is
infamous
beyond
all
power
to
express
i
wish
there
were
words
mean
enough
to
express
my
feelings
of
loathing
on
this
subject
what
harm
has
it
not
done
what
waste
places
has
it
not
made
it
has
planted
misery
and
wretchedness
in
this
world
it
peoples
the
future
with
selfish
joys
and
lurid
abysses
of
eternal
flame
but
we
are
getting
more
sense
every
day
we
begin
to
despise
those
monstrous
doctrines
if
you
want
to
better
men
and
women
change
their
conditions
here
do
promise
them
something
somewhere
else
one
biscuit
will
do
more
good
than
all
the
tracts
that
were
ever
peddled
in
the
world
give
them
more
whitewash
more
light
more
air
you
have
to
change
men
physically
before
you
change
them
intellectually
i
believe
the
time
will
come
when
every
criminal
will
be
treated
as
we
now
treat
the
diseased
and
sick
when
every
penitentiary
will
become
a
reformatory
and
that
if
criminals
go
to
them
with
hatred
in
their
bosoms
they
will
leave
them
without
feelings
of
revenge
let
me
tell
you
the
story
of
orpheus
and
eurydice
eurydice
had
been
carried
away
by
the
god
of
hell
and
orpheus
her
lover
went
in
quest
of
her
he
took
with
him
his
lyre
and
played
such
exquisite
music
that
all
hell
was
amazed
ixion
forgot
his
labors
at
the
wheel
the
daughters
of
danaus
ceased
from
their
hopeless
task
tantalus
forgot
his
thirst
even
pluto
smiled
and
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
hell
the
eyes
of
the
furies
were
wet
with
tears
as
it
was
with
the
lyre
of
orpheus
so
it
is
with
the
great
harmonies
of
science
which
are
rescuing
from
the
prisons
of
superstition
the
torn
and
bleeding
heart
of
man
ingersoll
lecture
on
individuality
an
arraignment
of
the
church
his
soul
was
like
a
star
and
dwelt
apart
on
every
hand
are
the
enemies
of
individuality
and
mental
freedom
custom
meets
us
at
the
cradle
and
leaves
us
only
at
the
tomb
our
first
questions
are
answered
by
ignorance
and
our
last
by
superstition
we
are
pushed
and
dragged
by
countless
hands
along
the
beaten
track
and
our
entire
training
can
be
summed
up
in
the
word
suppression
our
desire
to
have
a
thing
or
to
do
a
thing
is
considered
as
conclusive
evidence
that
we
ought
to
do
it
at
every
turn
we
run
not
to
have
it
and
ought
not
against
a
cherubim
and
a
flaming
sword
guarding
some
entrance
to
the
eden
of
our
desire
we
are
allowed
to
investigate
all
subjects
in
which
we
feel
no
particular
interest
and
to
express
the
opinions
of
the
majority
with
the
utmost
freedom
we
are
taught
that
liberty
of
speech
should
never
be
carried
to
the
extent
of
contradicting
the
dead
witnesses
of
a
popular
superstition
society
offers
continual
rewards
for
and
they
are
nearly
all
earned
and
claimed
and
some
are
paid
we
have
all
read
accounts
of
christian
gentlemen
remarking
when
about
to
be
hanged
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
for
them
if
they
had
only
followed
a
mother
advice
but
after
all
how
fortunate
it
is
for
the
world
that
the
maternal
advice
has
not
been
followed
how
lucky
it
is
for
us
all
that
it
is
somewhat
unnatural
for
a
human
being
to
obey
universal
obedience
is
universal
stagnation
disobedience
is
one
of
the
conditions
of
progress
select
any
age
of
the
world
and
tell
me
what
would
have
been
the
effect
of
implicit
obedience
suppose
the
church
had
had
absolute
control
of
the
human
mind
at
any
time
would
not
the
word
liberty
and
progress
have
been
blotted
from
the
human
speech
in
defiance
of
advice
the
world
has
advanced
suppose
the
astronomers
had
controlled
the
science
of
astronomy
suppose
the
doctors
had
controlled
the
science
of
medicine
suppose
kings
had
been
left
to
fix
the
form
of
government
suppose
our
fathers
had
taken
the
advice
of
paul
who
was
subject
to
the
powers
that
be
because
they
are
ordained
of
god
suppose
the
church
could
control
the
world
today
we
would
go
back
to
chaos
and
old
night
philosophy
would
be
branded
as
infamous
science
would
again
press
its
pale
and
thoughtful
face
against
the
prison
bars
and
round
the
limbs
of
liberty
would
climb
the
bigot
flame
it
is
a
blessed
thing
that
in
every
age
some
one
has
had
individuality
enough
and
courage
enough
to
stand
by
his
own
convictions
some
one
who
had
the
grit
to
say
his
say
i
believe
it
was
magellan
who
said
the
church
says
the
earth
is
flat
but
i
have
seen
its
shadow
on
the
moon
and
i
have
more
confidence
even
in
a
shadow
than
in
the
church
on
the
prow
of
his
ship
were
disobedience
defiance
scorn
and
success
the
trouble
with
most
people
is
that
they
bow
to
what
is
called
authority
they
have
a
certain
reverence
for
the
old
because
it
is
old
they
think
a
man
is
better
for
being
dead
especially
if
he
has
been
dead
a
long
time
and
that
the
forefathers
of
their
nation
were
the
greatest
and
best
of
all
mankind
all
these
things
they
implicitly
believe
because
it
is
popular
and
patriotic
and
because
they
were
told
so
when
very
small
and
remember
distinctly
of
hearing
mother
read
it
out
of
a
book
and
they
are
all
willing
to
swear
that
mother
was
a
good
woman
it
is
hard
to
overestimate
the
influence
of
early
training
in
the
direction
of
superstition
you
first
teach
children
that
a
certain
book
is
true
that
it
was
written
by
god
himself
that
to
question
its
truth
is
sin
that
to
deny
it
is
a
crime
and
that
should
they
die
without
believing
that
book
they
will
be
forever
damned
without
benefit
of
clergy
the
consequence
is
that
before
they
read
that
book
they
believe
it
to
be
true
when
they
do
read
their
minds
are
wholly
unfitted
to
investigate
its
claim
they
accept
it
as
a
matter
of
course
in
this
way
the
reason
is
overcome
the
sweet
instincts
of
humanity
are
blotted
from
the
heart
and
while
reading
its
infamous
pages
even
justice
throws
aside
her
scales
shrieking
for
revenge
and
charity
with
bloody
hands
applauds
a
deed
of
murder
in
this
way
we
are
taught
that
the
revenge
of
man
is
the
justice
of
god
that
mercy
is
not
the
same
everywhere
in
this
way
the
ideas
of
our
race
have
been
subverted
in
this
way
we
have
made
tyrants
bigots
and
inquisitors
in
this
way
the
brain
of
man
has
become
a
kind
of
palimpsest
upon
which
and
over
the
writings
of
nature
superstition
has
scribbled
her
countless
lies
our
great
trouble
is
that
most
teachers
are
dishonest
they
teach
as
certainties
those
things
concerning
which
they
entertain
doubts
they
do
not
say
we
think
this
is
so
but
we
know
this
is
so
they
do
not
appeal
to
the
reason
of
the
pupil
but
they
command
his
faith
they
keep
all
doubts
to
themselves
they
do
not
explain
they
assert
all
this
is
infamous
in
this
way
you
make
christians
but
you
can
not
make
men
you
can
not
make
women
you
can
make
followers
but
no
leaders
disciples
but
no
christs
you
may
promise
power
honor
and
happiness
to
all
those
who
will
blindly
follow
but
you
can
not
keep
your
promise
an
eastern
monarch
said
to
a
hermit
come
with
me
and
i
will
give
you
power
i
have
all
the
power
that
i
know
how
to
use
replied
the
hermit
come
said
the
king
i
will
give
you
wealth
i
have
no
wants
that
money
can
supply
i
will
give
you
honor
ah
honor
can
not
be
given
it
must
be
earned
come
said
the
king
making
a
last
appeal
and
i
will
give
you
happiness
no
said
the
man
of
solitude
there
is
no
happiness
without
liberty
and
he
who
follows
can
not
be
free
you
shall
have
liberty
too
then
i
will
stay
and
all
the
king
courtiers
thought
the
hermit
a
fool
now
and
then
somebody
examines
and
in
spite
of
all
keeps
up
his
manhood
and
has
courage
to
follow
where
his
reason
leads
then
the
pious
get
together
and
repeat
wise
saws
and
exchange
knowing
nods
and
most
prophetic
winks
the
stupidly
wise
sit
on
the
dead
limbs
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
solemnly
hoot
wealth
sneers
and
fashion
laughs
and
respectability
passes
on
the
other
side
and
scorn
points
with
all
her
skinny
fingers
and
like
the
snakes
of
superstition
writhe
and
hiss
and
slander
lends
her
tongue
and
infamy
her
brand
perjury
her
oath
and
the
law
its
power
and
bigotry
tortures
and
the
church
kills
the
church
hates
a
thinker
precisely
for
the
same
reason
that
a
robber
dislikes
a
sheriff
or
that
a
thief
despises
the
prosecuting
witness
tyranny
likes
courtiers
flatterers
followers
fawners
and
superstition
wants
believers
disciples
zealots
hypocrites
and
subscribers
the
church
demands
worship
the
very
thing
that
man
should
give
to
no
being
human
or
divine
to
worship
another
is
to
degrade
yourself
worship
is
awe
and
dread
and
vague
fear
and
blind
hope
it
is
the
spirit
of
worship
that
elevates
the
one
and
degrades
the
many
and
manacles
even
its
own
hands
the
spirit
of
worship
is
the
spirit
of
tyranny
the
worshiper
always
regrets
that
he
is
not
the
worshiped
we
should
all
remember
that
the
intellect
has
no
knees
and
that
whatever
the
attitude
of
the
body
may
be
the
brave
soul
is
always
found
erect
whoever
worships
abdicates
whoever
believes
at
the
commands
of
power
tramples
his
own
individuality
beneath
his
feet
and
voluntarily
robs
himself
of
all
that
renders
man
superior
to
brute
the
despotism
of
faith
is
justified
upon
the
ground
that
christian
countries
are
the
grandest
and
most
prosperous
of
the
world
at
one
time
the
same
thing
could
have
been
truly
said
in
india
in
egypt
in
greece
in
rome
and
in
every
country
that
has
in
the
history
of
the
world
swept
to
empire
this
argument
proves
too
much
not
only
but
the
assumption
upon
which
it
is
based
is
utterly
false
numberless
circumstances
and
countless
conditions
have
produced
the
prosperity
of
the
christian
world
the
truth
is
that
we
have
advanced
in
spite
of
religious
zeal
ignorance
and
opposition
the
church
has
won
no
victories
for
the
rights
of
man
over
every
fortress
of
tyranny
has
waved
and
still
waves
the
banner
of
the
church
wherever
brave
blood
has
been
shed
the
sword
of
the
church
has
been
wet
on
every
chain
has
been
the
sign
of
the
cross
the
alter
and
the
throne
have
leaned
against
and
supported
each
other
who
can
appreciate
the
infinite
impudence
of
one
man
assuming
to
think
for
others
who
can
imagine
the
impudence
of
a
church
that
threatens
to
inflict
eternal
punishment
upon
those
who
honestly
reject
its
claims
and
scorn
its
pretensions
in
the
presence
of
the
unknown
we
have
all
an
equal
right
to
guess
over
the
vast
plain
called
life
we
are
all
travelers
and
not
one
traveler
is
perfectly
certain
that
he
is
going
in
the
right
direction
true
it
is
that
no
other
plain
is
so
well
supplied
with
guideboards
at
every
turn
and
crossing
you
find
them
and
upon
each
one
is
written
the
exact
direction
and
distance
one
great
trouble
is
however
that
these
boards
are
all
different
and
the
result
is
that
most
travelers
are
confused
in
proportion
to
the
number
they
read
thousands
of
people
are
around
each
of
these
signs
and
each
one
is
doing
his
best
to
convince
the
traveler
that
his
particular
board
is
the
only
one
upon
which
the
least
reliance
can
be
placed
and
that
if
his
road
is
taken
the
reward
for
so
doing
will
be
infinite
and
eternal
while
all
the
other
roads
are
said
to
lead
to
hell
and
all
the
makers
of
the
other
guideboards
are
declared
to
be
heretics
hypocrites
and
liars
well
says
a
traveler
you
may
be
right
in
what
you
say
but
allow
me
at
least
to
read
some
of
the
other
directions
and
examine
a
little
into
their
claims
i
wish
to
rely
a
little
upon
my
own
judgment
in
a
matter
of
such
great
importance
no
sir
shouts
the
zealot
that
is
the
very
thing
you
are
not
allowed
to
do
you
must
go
my
way
without
investigation
or
you
are
as
good
as
damned
already
well
says
the
traveler
if
that
is
so
i
believe
i
had
better
go
your
way
and
so
most
of
them
go
along
taking
the
word
of
those
who
know
as
little
as
themselves
now
and
then
comes
one
who
in
spite
of
all
threats
calmly
examines
the
claims
of
all
and
as
calmly
rejects
them
all
these
travelers
take
roads
of
their
own
and
are
denounced
by
all
the
others
as
infidels
and
atheists
in
my
judgment
every
human
being
should
take
a
road
of
his
own
every
mind
should
be
true
to
itself
should
think
investigate
and
conclude
for
itself
this
is
a
duty
alike
incumbent
upon
pauper
and
prince
every
soul
should
repel
dictation
and
tyranny
no
matter
from
what
source
they
come
from
earth
or
heaven
from
men
or
gods
besides
every
traveler
upon
this
vast
plain
should
give
to
every
other
traveler
his
best
idea
as
to
the
road
that
should
be
taken
each
is
entitled
to
the
honest
opinion
of
all
and
there
is
but
one
way
to
get
an
honest
opinion
upon
any
subject
whatever
the
person
giving
the
opinion
must
be
free
from
fear
the
merchant
must
not
fear
to
lose
his
custom
the
doctor
his
practice
nor
the
preacher
his
pulpit
there
can
be
no
advance
without
liberty
suppression
of
honest
inquiry
is
retrogression
and
must
end
in
intellectual
night
the
tendency
of
orthodox
religion
today
is
towards
mental
slavery
and
barbarism
not
one
of
the
orthodox
ministers
dare
preach
what
he
thinks
if
he
knows
that
a
majority
of
his
congregation
think
otherwise
he
knows
that
every
member
of
his
church
stands
guard
over
his
brain
with
a
creed
like
a
club
in
his
hand
he
knows
that
he
is
not
expected
to
search
after
the
truth
but
that
he
is
employed
to
defend
the
creed
every
pulpit
is
a
pillory
in
which
stands
a
hired
culprit
defending
the
justice
of
his
own
imprisonment
is
it
desirable
that
all
should
be
exactly
alike
in
their
religious
convictions
is
any
such
thing
possible
do
we
not
know
that
there
are
no
two
persons
alike
in
the
whole
world
no
two
trees
no
two
leaves
no
two
anythings
that
are
alike
infinite
diversity
is
the
law
religion
tries
to
force
all
minds
into
one
mold
knowing
that
all
can
not
believe
the
church
endeavors
to
make
all
say
that
they
believe
she
longs
for
the
unity
of
hypocrisy
and
detests
the
splendid
diversity
of
individuality
and
freedom
nearly
all
people
stand
in
great
horror
of
annihilation
and
yet
to
give
up
your
individuality
is
to
annihilate
yourself
mental
slavery
is
mental
death
and
every
man
who
has
given
up
his
intellectual
freedom
is
the
living
coffin
of
his
dead
soul
in
this
sense
every
church
is
a
cemetery
and
every
creed
an
epitaph
we
should
all
remember
that
to
be
like
other
folks
is
to
be
unlike
ourselves
and
that
nothing
can
be
more
detestable
in
character
than
servile
imitation
the
great
trouble
with
imitation
is
that
we
are
apt
to
ape
those
who
are
in
reality
far
below
us
after
all
the
poorest
bargain
that
a
human
being
can
make
is
to
trade
off
his
individuality
for
what
is
called
respectability
there
is
no
saying
more
degrading
than
this
it
is
better
to
be
the
tail
of
a
lion
than
the
head
of
a
dog
it
is
a
responsibility
to
think
and
act
for
yourself
most
people
hate
responsibility
therefore
they
join
something
and
become
the
tail
of
some
lion
they
say
my
party
can
act
for
me
my
church
can
do
my
thinking
it
is
enough
for
me
to
pay
taxes
and
obey
the
lion
to
which
i
belong
without
troubling
myself
about
the
right
the
wrong
or
the
why
or
the
wherefore
of
anything
whatever
these
people
are
respectable
they
hate
reformers
and
dislike
exceedingly
to
have
their
minds
disturbed
they
regard
convictions
as
very
disagreeable
things
to
have
they
love
forms
and
enjoy
beyond
everything
else
telling
what
a
splendid
tail
their
lion
has
and
what
a
troublesome
dog
their
neighbor
is
besides
this
natural
inclination
to
avoid
personal
responsibility
is
and
always
has
been
the
fact
that
every
religionist
has
warned
men
against
the
presumption
and
wickedness
of
thinking
for
themselves
the
reason
has
been
denounced
by
all
christendom
as
the
only
unsafe
guide
the
church
has
left
nothing
undone
to
prevent
man
following
the
logic
of
his
brain
the
plainest
facts
have
been
covered
with
the
mantle
of
mystery
the
grossest
absurdities
have
been
declared
to
be
facts
the
order
of
nature
has
been
as
it
were
reversed
in
order
that
the
hypocritical
few
might
govern
the
honest
many
the
man
who
stood
by
the
conclusion
of
his
reason
was
denounced
as
a
scorner
and
hater
of
god
and
his
holy
church
from
the
organization
of
the
first
church
until
this
moment
every
member
has
borne
the
marks
of
collar
and
chain
and
whip
no
man
ever
seriously
attempted
to
reform
a
church
without
being
cast
out
and
hunted
down
by
the
hounds
of
hypocrisy
the
highest
crime
against
a
creed
is
to
change
it
reformation
is
treason
thousands
of
young
men
are
being
educated
at
this
moment
by
the
various
churches
what
for
in
order
that
they
may
be
prepared
to
investigate
the
phenomena
by
which
we
are
surrounded
no
the
object
and
the
only
object
is
that
they
may
be
prepared
to
defend
a
creed
that
they
may
learn
the
arguments
of
their
respective
churches
and
repeat
them
in
the
dull
ears
of
a
thoughtless
congregation
if
one
after
being
thus
trained
at
the
expense
of
the
methodists
turns
presbyterian
or
baptist
he
is
denounced
as
an
ungrateful
wretch
honest
investigation
is
utterly
impossible
within
the
pale
of
any
church
for
the
reason
that
if
you
think
the
church
is
right
you
will
not
investigate
and
if
you
think
it
wrong
the
church
will
investigate
you
the
consequence
of
this
is
that
most
of
the
theological
literature
is
the
result
of
suppression
of
fear
of
tyranny
and
hypocrisy
every
orthodox
writer
necessarily
said
to
himself
if
i
write
that
my
wife
and
children
may
want
for
bread
i
will
be
covered
with
shame
and
branded
with
infamy
but
if
i
write
this
i
will
gain
position
power
and
honor
my
church
rewards
defenders
and
burns
reformers
under
these
conditions
all
your
scotts
henrys
and
mcknights
have
written
and
weighed
in
these
scales
what
are
their
commentaries
worth
they
are
not
the
ideas
and
decisions
of
honest
judges
but
the
sophisms
of
the
paid
attorneys
of
superstition
who
can
tell
what
the
world
has
lost
by
this
infamous
system
of
suppression
how
many
grand
thinkers
died
with
the
mailed
hand
of
superstition
on
their
lips
how
many
splendid
ideas
have
perished
in
the
cradle
of
the
brain
strangled
in
the
poisonous
coils
of
that
python
the
church
for
thousands
of
years
a
thinker
was
hunted
down
like
an
escaped
convict
to
him
who
had
braved
the
church
every
door
was
shut
every
knife
was
open
to
shelter
him
from
the
wild
storm
to
give
him
a
crust
of
bread
when
dying
to
put
a
cup
of
water
to
his
cracked
and
bleeding
lips
these
were
all
crimes
not
one
of
which
the
church
ever
did
forgive
and
with
the
justice
taught
of
god
his
helpless
children
were
exterminated
as
scorpions
and
vipers
who
at
the
present
day
can
imagine
the
courage
the
devotion
to
principle
the
intellectual
and
moral
grandeur
it
once
required
to
be
an
infidel
to
brave
the
church
her
racks
her
fagots
her
dungeons
her
tongues
of
fire
to
defy
and
scorn
her
heaven
and
her
devil
and
her
god
they
were
the
noblest
sons
of
earth
they
were
the
real
saviors
of
our
race
the
destroyers
of
superstition
and
the
creators
of
science
they
were
the
real
titans
who
bared
their
grand
foreheads
to
all
the
thunderbolts
of
all
the
gods
the
church
has
been
and
still
is
the
great
robber
she
has
rifled
not
only
the
pockets
but
the
brains
of
the
world
she
is
the
stone
at
the
sepulcher
of
liberty
the
upas
tree
in
whose
shade
the
intellect
of
man
has
withered
the
gorgon
beneath
whose
gaze
the
human
heart
has
turned
to
stone
under
her
influence
even
the
protestant
mother
expects
to
be
in
heaven
while
her
brave
boy
who
is
fighting
for
the
rights
of
man
shall
writhe
in
hell
it
is
said
that
some
of
the
indian
tribes
place
the
heads
of
their
children
between
pieces
of
bark
until
the
form
of
the
skull
is
permanently
changed
to
us
this
seems
a
most
shocking
custom
and
yet
after
all
is
it
as
bad
as
to
put
the
souls
of
our
children
in
the
of
a
creed
to
so
utterly
deform
their
minds
that
they
regard
the
god
of
the
bible
as
a
being
of
infinite
mercy
and
really
consider
it
a
virtue
to
believe
a
thing
just
because
it
seems
unreasonable
every
child
in
the
christian
world
has
uttered
its
wondering
protest
against
this
outrage
all
the
machinery
of
the
church
is
constantly
employed
in
thus
corrupting
the
reason
of
children
in
every
possible
way
they
are
robbed
of
their
own
thoughts
and
forced
to
accept
the
statements
of
others
every
has
for
its
object
the
crushing
out
of
every
germ
of
individuality
the
poor
children
are
taught
that
nothing
can
be
more
acceptable
to
god
than
unreasoning
obedience
and
eyeless
faith
and
that
to
believe
that
god
did
an
impossible
act
is
far
better
than
to
do
a
good
one
yourself
they
are
told
that
all
the
religions
have
been
simply
the
john
the
baptist
of
ours
that
all
the
gods
of
antiquity
have
withered
and
sunken
into
the
jehovah
of
the
jews
that
all
the
longings
and
aspirations
of
the
race
are
realized
in
the
motto
of
the
evangelical
alliance
liberty
in
that
all
there
is
or
ever
was
of
religion
can
be
found
in
the
apostle
creed
that
there
is
nothing
left
to
be
discovered
that
all
the
thinkers
are
dead
and
all
the
living
should
simply
be
believers
that
we
have
only
to
repeat
the
epitaph
found
on
the
grave
of
wisdom
that
graveyards
are
the
best
possible
universities
and
that
the
children
must
be
forever
beaten
with
the
bones
of
the
fathers
it
has
always
seemed
absurd
to
suppose
that
a
god
would
choose
for
his
companions
during
all
eternity
the
dear
souls
whose
highest
and
only
ambition
is
to
obey
he
certainly
would
now
and
then
be
tempted
to
make
the
same
remark
made
by
an
english
gentleman
to
his
poor
guest
this
gentleman
had
invited
a
man
in
humble
circumstances
to
dine
with
him
the
man
was
so
overcome
with
honor
that
to
everything
the
gentleman
said
he
replied
yes
tired
at
last
with
the
monotony
of
acquiescence
the
gentleman
cried
out
for
god
sake
my
good
man
say
just
once
so
there
will
be
two
of
us
is
it
possible
that
an
infinite
god
created
this
world
simply
to
be
the
of
slaves
and
serfs
simply
for
the
purpose
of
raising
orthodox
christians
that
he
did
a
few
miracles
to
astonish
them
that
all
the
evils
of
life
are
simply
his
punishments
and
that
he
is
finally
going
to
turn
heaven
into
a
kind
of
religious
museum
filled
with
baptist
barnacles
petrified
presbyterians
and
methodist
mummies
i
want
no
heaven
for
which
i
must
give
my
reason
no
happiness
in
exchange
for
my
liberty
and
no
immortality
that
demands
the
surrender
of
my
individuality
better
rot
in
the
windowless
tomb
to
which
there
is
no
door
but
the
red
mouth
of
the
pallid
worm
than
wear
the
jeweled
collar
even
of
a
god
religion
does
not
and
can
not
contemplate
man
as
free
she
accepts
only
the
homage
of
the
prostrate
and
scorns
the
offerings
of
those
who
stand
erect
she
can
not
tolerate
the
liberty
of
thought
the
wide
and
sunny
fields
belong
not
to
her
domain
the
heights
of
genius
and
individuality
are
above
and
beyond
her
appreciation
and
power
her
subjects
cringe
at
her
feet
covered
with
the
dust
of
obedience
they
are
not
athletes
standing
posed
by
rich
life
and
brave
endeavor
like
the
antique
statues
but
shriveled
deformities
studying
with
furtive
glance
the
cruel
face
of
power
no
religionist
seems
capable
of
comprehending
this
plain
truth
there
is
this
difference
between
thought
and
action
for
our
actions
we
are
responsible
to
ourselves
and
to
those
injuriously
affected
for
thoughts
there
can
in
the
nature
of
things
be
no
responsibility
to
gods
or
men
here
or
hereafter
and
yet
the
protestant
has
vied
with
the
catholic
in
denouncing
freedom
of
thought
and
while
i
was
taught
to
hate
catholicism
with
every
drop
of
my
blood
it
is
only
justice
to
say
that
in
all
essential
particulars
it
is
precisely
the
same
as
every
other
religion
luther
denounced
mental
liberty
with
all
the
coarse
and
brutal
vigor
of
his
nature
calvin
despised
from
the
very
bottom
of
his
petrified
heart
anything
that
even
looked
like
religious
toleration
and
solemnly
declared
to
advocate
it
was
to
crucify
christ
afresh
all
the
founders
of
all
the
orthodox
churches
have
advocated
the
same
infamous
tenet
the
truth
is
that
what
is
called
religion
is
necessarily
inconsistent
with
free
thought
a
believer
is
a
songless
bird
in
a
cage
a
freethinker
is
an
eagle
parting
the
clouds
with
tireless
wings
at
present
owing
to
the
inroads
that
have
been
made
by
liberals
and
infidels
most
of
the
churches
pretend
to
be
in
favor
of
religious
liberty
of
these
churches
we
will
ask
this
question
how
can
a
man
who
conscientiously
believes
in
religious
liberty
worship
a
god
who
does
not
they
say
to
us
we
will
not
imprison
you
on
account
of
your
belief
but
our
god
will
we
will
not
burn
you
because
you
throw
away
the
sacred
scriptures
but
their
author
will
we
think
it
an
infamous
crime
to
persecute
our
brethren
for
opinion
sake
but
the
god
whom
we
ignorantly
worship
will
on
that
account
damn
his
own
children
forever
why
is
it
that
these
christians
do
not
only
detest
the
infidels
but
so
cordially
despise
each
other
why
do
they
refuse
to
worship
in
the
temples
of
each
other
why
do
they
care
so
little
for
the
damnation
of
men
and
so
much
for
the
baptism
of
children
why
will
they
adorn
their
churches
with
the
money
of
thieves
and
flatter
vice
for
the
sake
of
subscription
why
will
they
attempt
to
bribe
science
to
certify
to
the
writings
of
god
why
do
they
torture
the
words
of
the
great
into
an
acknowledgment
of
the
truth
of
christianity
why
do
they
stand
with
hat
in
hand
before
presidents
kings
emperors
and
scientists
begging
like
lazarus
for
a
few
crumbs
of
religious
comfort
why
are
they
so
delighted
to
find
an
allusion
to
providence
in
the
message
of
lincoln
why
are
they
so
afraid
that
some
one
will
find
out
that
paley
wrote
an
essay
in
favor
of
the
epicurean
philosophy
and
that
sir
isaac
newton
was
once
an
infidel
why
are
they
so
anxious
to
show
that
voltaire
recanted
that
paine
died
palsied
with
fear
that
the
emperor
julian
cried
out
galilean
thou
hast
conquered
that
gibbon
died
a
catholic
that
agassiz
had
a
little
confidence
in
moses
that
the
old
napoleon
was
once
complimentary
enough
to
say
that
he
thought
christ
greater
than
himself
or
caesar
that
washington
was
caught
on
his
knees
at
valley
forge
that
blunt
old
ethan
allen
told
his
child
to
believe
the
religion
of
her
mother
that
franklin
said
do
unchain
the
tiger
that
volney
got
frightened
in
a
storm
at
sea
and
that
oakes
ames
was
a
wholesale
liar
is
it
because
the
foundation
of
their
temple
is
crumbling
because
the
walls
are
cracked
the
pillars
leaning
the
great
dome
swaying
to
its
fall
and
because
science
has
written
over
the
high
altar
its
mene
mene
tekel
upharsin
the
old
words
destined
to
be
the
epitaph
of
all
religions
every
assertion
of
individual
independence
has
been
a
step
towards
infidelity
luther
started
toward
humboldt
wesley
toward
bradlaugh
to
really
reform
the
church
is
to
destroy
it
every
new
religion
has
a
little
less
superstition
than
the
old
so
that
the
religion
of
science
is
but
a
question
of
time
i
will
not
say
the
church
has
been
an
unmitigated
evil
in
all
respects
its
history
is
infamous
and
glorious
it
has
delighted
in
the
production
of
extremes
it
has
furnished
murderers
for
its
own
martyrs
it
has
sometimes
fed
the
body
but
has
always
starved
the
soul
it
has
been
a
charitable
highwayman
a
generous
pirate
it
has
produced
some
angels
and
a
multitude
of
devils
it
has
built
more
prisons
than
asylums
it
made
a
hundred
orphans
while
it
cared
for
one
in
one
hand
it
carried
the
and
in
the
other
a
sword
it
has
founded
schools
and
endowed
universities
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
true
learning
it
filled
the
world
with
hypocrites
and
zealots
and
upon
the
cross
of
its
own
christ
it
crucified
the
individuality
of
man
it
has
sought
to
destroy
the
independence
of
the
soul
and
put
the
world
upon
its
knees
this
is
its
crime
the
commission
of
this
crime
was
necessary
to
its
existence
in
order
to
compel
obedience
it
declared
that
it
had
the
truth
and
all
the
truth
that
god
had
made
it
the
keeper
of
all
his
secrets
his
agent
and
his
it
declared
that
all
other
religions
were
false
and
infamous
it
rendered
all
compromises
impossible
and
all
thought
superfluous
thought
was
an
enemy
obedience
was
its
friend
investigation
was
fraught
with
danger
therefore
investigation
was
suppressed
the
holy
of
holies
was
behind
the
curtain
all
this
was
upon
the
principle
that
forgers
hate
to
have
the
signature
examined
by
an
expert
and
that
imposture
detests
curiosity
he
that
hath
ears
to
hear
let
him
hear
has
always
been
one
of
the
favorite
texts
of
the
church
in
short
christianity
has
always
opposed
every
forward
movement
of
the
human
race
across
the
highway
of
progress
it
has
always
been
building
breastworks
of
bibles
tracts
commentaries
prayerbooks
creeds
dogmas
and
platforms
and
at
every
advance
the
christians
have
gathered
behind
these
heaps
of
rubbish
and
shot
the
poisoned
arrows
of
malice
at
the
soldiers
of
freedom
and
even
the
liberal
christian
of
today
has
his
holy
of
holies
and
in
the
niche
of
the
temple
of
his
heart
has
his
idol
he
still
clings
to
a
part
of
the
old
superstition
and
all
the
pleasant
memories
of
the
old
belief
linger
in
the
horizon
of
his
thoughts
like
a
sunset
we
associate
the
memory
of
those
we
love
with
the
religion
of
our
childhood
it
seems
almost
a
sacrilege
to
rudely
destroy
the
idols
that
our
fathers
worshiped
and
turn
their
sacred
and
beautiful
truths
into
the
silly
fables
of
barbarism
some
throw
away
the
old
testament
and
cling
to
the
new
while
others
give
up
everything
except
the
idea
that
there
is
a
personal
god
and
that
in
some
wonderful
way
we
are
the
objects
of
his
care
even
this
in
my
opinion
as
science
the
great
iconoclast
marches
onward
will
have
to
be
abandoned
with
the
rest
the
great
ghost
will
surely
share
the
fate
of
the
little
ones
they
fled
at
the
first
appearance
of
the
dawn
and
the
other
will
vanish
with
the
perfect
day
until
then
the
independence
of
man
is
little
more
than
a
dream
overshadowed
by
an
immense
personality
in
the
presence
of
the
irresponsible
and
the
infinite
the
individuality
of
man
is
lost
and
he
falls
prostrate
in
the
very
dust
of
fear
beneath
the
frown
of
the
absolute
man
stands
a
wretched
trembling
slave
beneath
his
smile
be
is
at
best
only
a
fortunate
serf
governed
by
a
being
whose
arbitrary
will
is
law
chained
to
the
chariot
of
power
his
destiny
rests
in
the
pleasure
of
the
unknown
under
these
circumstances
what
wretched
object
can
he
have
in
lengthening
out
his
aimless
life
and
yet
in
most
minds
there
is
a
vague
fear
of
what
the
gods
may
do
and
the
safe
side
is
considered
the
best
side
a
gentleman
walking
among
the
ruins
of
athens
came
upon
a
fallen
statue
of
jupiter
making
an
exceedingly
low
bow
he
said
jupiter
i
salute
thee
he
then
added
should
you
ever
get
up
in
the
world
again
do
not
forget
i
pray
you
that
i
treated
you
politely
while
you
were
prostrate
we
have
all
been
taught
by
the
church
that
nothing
is
so
well
calculated
to
excite
the
ire
of
deity
as
to
express
a
doubt
as
to
his
existence
and
that
to
deny
it
is
an
unpardonable
sin
numerous
instances
were
referred
to
of
atheists
being
struck
dead
for
denying
the
existence
of
god
according
to
these
religious
people
god
is
infinitely
above
us
in
every
respect
infinitely
merciful
and
yet
he
can
not
bear
to
hear
a
poor
finite
man
honestly
question
his
existence
knowing
as
he
does
that
his
children
are
groping
in
darkness
and
struggling
with
doubt
and
fear
knowing
that
he
could
enlighten
them
if
he
would
he
still
holds
the
expression
of
a
sincere
doubt
as
to
his
existence
the
most
infamous
of
crimes
according
to
the
orthodox
logic
god
having
furnished
us
with
imperfect
minds
has
a
right
to
demand
a
perfect
result
suppose
smith
should
overhear
a
couple
of
small
bugs
holding
a
discussion
as
to
the
existence
of
smith
and
suppose
one
should
have
the
temerity
to
declare
upon
the
honor
of
a
bug
that
he
had
examined
the
whole
question
to
the
best
of
his
ability
including
the
argument
based
upon
design
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
no
man
by
the
name
of
smith
had
ever
lived
think
then
of
smith
flying
into
an
ecstasy
of
rage
crushing
the
atheist
bug
beneath
his
iron
heel
while
he
exclaimed
i
will
teach
you
blasphemous
wretch
that
smith
is
a
diabolical
fact
what
then
can
we
think
of
god
who
would
open
the
artillery
of
heaven
upon
one
of
his
own
children
for
simply
expressing
his
honest
thought
and
what
man
who
really
thinks
can
help
repeating
the
words
of
aeneas
if
there
are
gods
they
certainly
pay
no
attention
to
the
affairs
of
man
in
religious
ideas
and
conceptions
there
has
been
for
ages
a
slow
and
steady
development
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
speaking
of
modern
times
is
catholicism
and
at
the
top
are
atheism
and
science
the
intermediate
rounds
of
this
ladder
are
occupied
by
the
various
sects
whose
name
is
legion
but
whatever
may
be
the
truth
on
any
subject
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
right
to
investigate
that
subject
and
express
any
opinion
we
may
form
all
that
i
ask
is
the
right
i
freely
accord
to
all
others
a
few
years
ago
a
methodist
clergyman
took
it
upon
himself
to
give
me
a
piece
of
friendly
advice
although
you
may
disbelieve
the
bible
said
he
you
ought
not
to
say
so
that
you
should
keep
to
yourself
do
you
believe
the
bible
said
i
he
replied
most
assuredly
to
which
i
retorted
your
answer
conveys
no
information
to
me
you
may
be
following
your
own
advice
you
told
me
to
suppress
my
opinions
of
course
a
man
who
will
advise
others
to
dissimulate
will
not
always
be
particular
about
telling
the
truth
himself
it
is
the
duty
of
each
and
every
one
to
maintain
his
individuality
this
above
all
to
thine
own
self
be
true
and
it
must
follow
as
the
night
the
day
thou
canst
not
then
be
false
to
any
man
it
is
a
magnificent
thing
to
be
the
sole
proprietor
of
yourself
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
wake
up
at
night
and
say
there
is
nobody
in
this
bed
it
is
humiliating
to
know
that
your
ideas
are
all
borrowed
and
that
you
are
indebted
to
your
memory
for
your
principles
that
your
religion
is
simply
one
of
your
habits
and
that
you
would
have
convictions
if
they
were
only
contagious
it
is
mortifying
to
feel
that
you
belong
to
a
mental
mob
and
cry
crucify
him
because
the
others
do
that
you
reap
what
the
great
and
brave
have
sown
and
that
you
can
benefit
the
world
only
by
leaving
it
surely
every
human
being
ought
to
attain
to
the
dignity
of
the
unit
surely
it
is
worth
something
to
be
one
and
to
feel
that
the
census
of
the
universe
would
not
be
complete
without
counting
you
surely
there
is
grandeur
in
knowing
that
in
the
realm
of
thought
at
least
you
are
without
a
chain
that
you
have
the
right
to
explore
all
heights
and
all
depths
that
there
are
no
walls
fences
prohibited
places
nor
sacred
corners
in
all
the
vast
expanse
of
thought
that
your
intellect
owes
no
allegiance
to
any
being
human
or
divine
that
you
hold
all
in
fee
and
upon
no
condition
and
by
no
tenure
whatever
that
in
the
world
of
mind
you
are
relieved
from
all
personal
dictation
and
from
the
ignorant
tyranny
of
majorities
surely
it
is
worth
something
to
feel
that
there
are
no
priests
no
popes
no
parties
no
governments
no
kings
no
gods
to
whom
your
intellect
can
be
compelled
to
pay
a
reluctant
homage
surely
it
is
a
joy
to
know
that
all
the
cruel
ingenuity
of
bigotry
can
devise
no
prison
no
lock
no
cell
in
which
for
one
instant
to
confine
a
thought
that
ideas
can
not
be
dislocated
by
racks
nor
crushed
in
iron
boots
nor
burned
with
fire
surely
it
is
sublime
to
think
that
the
brain
is
a
castle
and
that
within
its
curious
bastions
and
winding
halls
the
soul
in
spite
of
all
worlds
and
all
beings
is
the
supreme
sovereign
of
itself
ingersoll
lecture
on
humboldt
ladies
and
gentlemen
great
minds
seem
to
be
a
part
of
the
infinite
those
possessing
them
seem
to
be
brothers
of
the
mountains
and
the
seas
humboldt
was
one
of
these
he
was
one
of
the
few
great
enough
to
rise
above
the
superstition
and
prejudice
of
his
time
and
to
know
that
experience
observation
and
reason
are
the
only
basis
of
knowledge
he
became
one
of
the
greatest
of
men
in
spite
of
having
been
born
rich
and
noble
in
spite
of
position
i
say
in
spite
of
these
things
because
wealth
and
position
are
generally
the
enemies
of
genius
and
the
destroyers
of
talent
it
is
often
said
of
this
or
that
man
that
he
is
a
man
that
he
was
born
of
the
poorest
and
humblest
parents
and
that
with
every
obstacle
to
overcome
he
became
great
this
is
a
mistake
poverty
is
generally
an
advantage
most
of
the
intellectual
giants
of
the
world
have
been
nursed
at
the
sad
but
loving
breast
of
poverty
most
of
those
who
have
climbed
highest
on
the
shining
ladder
of
fame
commenced
at
the
lowest
round
they
were
reared
in
the
cottages
of
europe
in
the
of
america
in
the
factories
of
the
great
cities
in
the
midst
of
toil
in
the
smoke
and
din
of
labor
and
on
the
verge
of
want
they
were
rocked
by
the
feet
of
mothers
whose
hands
at
the
same
time
were
busy
with
the
needle
or
the
wheel
it
is
hard
for
the
rich
to
resist
the
thousand
allurements
of
pleasure
and
so
i
say
that
humboldt
in
spite
of
having
been
born
to
wealth
and
high
social
position
became
truly
and
grandly
great
in
the
antiquated
and
romantic
castle
of
tegel
by
the
side
of
the
pine
forest
on
the
shore
of
the
charming
lake
near
the
beautiful
city
of
berlin
the
great
humboldt
one
hundred
years
ago
was
born
and
there
he
was
educated
after
the
method
suggested
by
rousseau
campe
the
philologist
and
critic
and
the
intellectual
kunth
being
his
tutors
there
he
received
the
impressions
that
determined
his
career
there
the
great
idea
that
the
universe
is
governed
by
law
took
possession
of
his
mind
and
there
he
dedicated
his
life
to
the
demonstration
of
this
sublime
truth
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
source
of
man
unhappiness
is
his
ignorance
of
nature
he
longed
to
give
a
physical
description
of
the
universe
a
grand
picture
of
nature
to
account
for
all
phenomena
to
discover
the
laws
governing
the
world
to
do
away
with
that
splendid
delusion
called
and
to
establish
the
fact
that
the
universe
is
governed
by
law
to
establish
this
truth
was
and
is
of
infinite
importance
to
mankind
that
fact
is
the
of
superstition
it
gives
liberty
to
every
soul
annihilates
fear
and
ushers
in
the
age
of
reason
the
object
of
this
illustrious
man
was
to
comprehend
the
phenomena
of
physical
objects
in
their
general
connection
and
to
represent
nature
as
one
great
whole
moved
and
animated
by
internal
forces
for
this
purpose
he
turned
his
attention
to
descriptive
botany
traversing
distant
lands
and
mountain
ranges
to
ascertain
with
certainty
the
geographical
distribution
of
plants
he
investigated
the
laws
regulating
the
differences
of
temperature
and
climate
and
the
changes
of
the
atmosphere
he
studied
the
formation
of
the
crust
explored
the
deepest
mines
ascended
the
highest
mountains
and
wandered
through
the
craters
of
extinct
volcanoes
he
became
thoroughly
acquainted
with
chemistry
with
astronomy
with
terrestrial
magnetism
and
as
the
investigation
of
one
subject
leads
to
all
others
for
the
reason
that
there
is
a
mutual
dependence
and
a
necessary
connection
between
all
facts
so
humboldt
became
acquainted
with
all
the
known
sciences
his
fame
does
not
depend
so
much
upon
his
discoveries
although
he
discovered
enough
to
make
hundreds
of
reputations
as
upon
his
vast
and
splendid
generalizations
he
was
to
science
what
shakespeare
was
to
the
drama
he
found
so
to
speak
the
world
full
of
unconnected
facts
all
portions
of
a
vast
system
parts
of
a
great
machine
he
discovered
the
connection
that
each
bears
to
all
put
them
together
and
demonstrated
beyond
all
contradiction
that
the
earth
is
governed
by
law
he
knew
that
to
discover
the
connection
of
phenomena
is
the
primary
aim
of
all
natural
investigation
he
was
infinitely
practical
origin
and
destiny
were
questions
with
which
he
had
nothing
to
do
his
surroundings
made
him
what
he
was
in
accordance
with
a
law
not
fully
comprehended
he
was
a
production
of
his
time
great
men
do
not
live
alone
they
are
surrounded
by
the
great
they
are
the
instruments
used
to
accomplish
the
tendencies
of
their
generation
they
fulfill
the
prophecies
of
their
age
nearly
all
of
the
scientific
men
of
the
eighteenth
century
had
the
same
idea
entertained
by
humboldt
but
most
of
them
in
a
dim
and
confused
way
there
was
however
a
general
belief
among
the
intelligent
that
the
world
is
governed
by
law
and
that
there
really
exists
a
connection
between
all
facts
or
that
all
facts
are
simply
the
different
aspects
of
a
general
fact
and
that
the
task
of
science
is
to
discover
this
connection
to
comprehend
this
general
fact
or
to
announce
the
laws
of
things
germany
was
full
of
thought
and
her
universities
swarmed
with
philosophers
and
grand
thinkers
in
every
department
of
knowledge
humboldt
was
the
friend
and
companion
of
the
greatest
poets
historians
philologists
artists
statesmen
critics
and
logicians
of
his
time
he
was
the
companion
of
schiller
who
believed
that
man
would
be
regenerated
through
the
influence
of
the
beautiful
of
goethe
the
grand
patriarch
of
german
literature
of
wieland
who
has
been
called
the
voltaire
of
germany
of
herder
who
wrote
the
outlines
of
a
philosophical
history
of
man
of
kotzebue
who
lived
in
the
world
of
romance
of
schleiermacher
the
pantheist
of
schlegel
who
gave
to
his
country
the
enchanted
realm
of
shakespeare
of
the
sublime
kant
author
of
the
first
work
published
in
germany
on
pure
reason
of
fichte
the
infinite
idealist
of
schopenhauer
the
european
buddhist
who
followed
the
great
gautama
to
the
painless
and
dreamless
nirvana
and
of
hundreds
of
others
whose
names
are
familiar
to
and
honored
by
the
scientific
world
the
german
mind
had
been
grandly
roused
from
the
long
lethargy
of
the
dark
ages
of
ignorance
fear
and
faith
guided
by
the
holy
light
of
reason
every
department
of
knowledge
was
investigated
enriched
and
illustrated
humboldt
breathed
the
atmosphere
of
investigation
old
ideas
were
abandoned
old
creeds
hallowed
by
centuries
were
thrown
aside
thought
became
courageous
the
athlete
reason
challenged
to
mortal
combat
the
monsters
of
superstition
no
wonder
that
under
these
influences
humboldt
formed
the
great
purpose
of
presenting
to
the
world
a
picture
of
nature
in
order
that
men
might
for
the
first
time
behold
the
face
of
their
mother
europe
becoming
too
small
for
his
genius
he
visited
the
tropics
in
the
new
world
where
in
the
most
circumscribed
limits
he
could
find
the
greatest
number
of
plants
of
animals
and
the
greatest
diversity
of
climate
that
he
might
ascertain
the
laws
governing
the
production
and
distribution
of
plants
animals
and
men
and
the
effects
of
climate
upon
them
all
he
sailed
along
the
gigantic
amazon
the
mysterious
orinoco
traversed
the
pampas
climbed
the
andes
until
he
stood
upon
the
crags
of
chimborazo
more
than
eighteen
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
climbed
on
until
blood
flowed
from
his
eyes
and
lips
for
nearly
five
years
he
pursued
his
investigations
in
the
new
world
accompanied
by
the
intrepid
bonpland
nothing
escaped
his
attention
he
was
the
best
intellectual
organ
of
these
new
revelations
of
science
he
was
calm
reflective
and
eloquent
filled
with
a
sense
of
the
beautiful
and
the
love
of
truth
his
collections
were
immense
and
valuable
beyond
calculation
to
every
science
he
endured
innumerable
hardships
braved
countless
dangers
in
unknown
and
savage
lands
and
exhausted
his
fortune
for
the
advancement
of
true
learning
upon
his
return
to
europe
he
was
hailed
as
the
second
columbus
as
the
scientific
discoverer
of
america
as
the
revealer
of
a
new
world
as
the
great
demonstrator
of
the
sublime
truth
that
universe
is
governed
by
law
i
have
seen
a
picture
of
the
old
man
sitting
upon
a
mountain
side
above
him
the
eternal
snow
below
smiling
valley
of
the
tropics
filled
with
vine
and
palm
his
chin
upon
his
breast
his
eyes
deep
thoughtful
and
calm
his
forehead
majestic
grander
than
the
mountain
upon
which
he
sat
crowned
with
the
snow
of
his
whitened
hair
he
looked
the
intellectual
autocrat
of
this
world
not
satisfied
with
his
discoveries
in
america
he
crossed
the
steppes
of
asia
the
wastes
of
siberia
the
great
ural
range
adding
to
the
knowledge
of
mankind
at
every
step
his
energy
acknowledged
no
obstacle
his
life
knew
no
leisure
every
day
was
filled
with
labor
and
with
thought
he
was
one
of
the
apostles
of
science
and
he
served
his
divine
master
with
a
zeal
that
knew
no
abatement
with
an
ardor
that
constantly
increased
and
with
a
devotion
unwavering
and
constant
as
the
polar
star
in
order
that
the
people
at
large
might
have
the
benefit
of
his
numerous
discoveries
and
his
vast
knowledge
he
delivered
at
berlin
a
course
of
lectures
consisting
of
free
addresses
upon
the
following
subjects
five
upon
the
nature
and
limits
of
physical
geography
three
were
devoted
to
a
history
of
science
two
to
inducements
to
a
study
of
natural
science
sixteen
on
the
heavens
five
on
the
form
density
latent
heat
and
magnetic
power
of
the
earth
and
to
the
polar
light
four
were
on
the
nature
of
the
crust
of
the
earth
on
hot
springs
earthquakes
and
volcanoes
two
on
mountains
and
the
type
of
their
formation
two
on
the
form
of
the
earth
surface
on
the
connection
of
continents
and
the
elevation
of
soil
over
ravines
three
on
the
sea
as
a
globular
fluid
surrounding
the
earth
ten
on
the
atmosphere
as
an
elastic
fluid
surrounding
the
earth
and
on
the
distribution
of
heat
one
on
the
geographic
distribution
of
organized
matter
in
general
three
on
the
geography
of
plants
three
on
the
geography
of
animals
and
two
on
the
races
of
men
these
lectures
are
what
is
known
as
the
cosmos
and
present
a
scientific
picture
of
the
world
of
infinite
diversity
in
unity
of
ceaseless
motion
in
the
eternal
grasp
of
law
these
lectures
contain
the
result
of
his
investigation
observation
and
experience
they
furnish
the
connection
between
phenomena
they
disclose
some
of
the
changes
through
which
the
earth
has
passed
in
the
countless
ages
the
history
of
vegetation
animals
and
men
the
effects
of
climate
upon
individuals
and
nations
the
relation
we
sustain
to
other
worlds
and
demonstrate
that
all
phenomena
whether
insignificant
or
grand
exist
in
accordance
with
inexorable
law
there
are
some
truths
however
that
we
never
should
forget
superstition
has
always
been
the
relentless
enemy
of
science
faith
has
been
a
hater
of
demonstration
hypocrisy
has
been
sincere
only
in
its
dread
of
truth
and
all
religions
are
inconsistent
with
mental
freedom
since
the
murder
of
hypatia
in
the
fifth
century
when
the
polished
blade
of
greek
philosophy
was
broken
by
the
club
of
ignorant
catholicism
until
today
superstition
has
detested
every
effort
of
reason
it
is
almost
impossible
to
conceive
of
the
completeness
of
the
victory
that
the
church
achieved
over
philosophy
for
ages
science
was
utterly
ignored
thought
was
a
poor
slave
an
ignorant
priest
was
master
of
the
world
faith
put
out
the
eyes
of
the
soul
the
reason
was
a
trembling
coward
the
imagination
was
set
on
fire
of
hell
every
human
feeling
was
sought
to
be
suppressed
love
was
considered
infinitely
sinful
pleasure
was
the
road
to
eternal
fire
and
god
was
supposed
to
be
happy
only
when
his
children
were
miserable
the
world
was
governed
by
an
almighty
whim
prayers
could
change
the
order
of
things
halt
the
grand
procession
of
nature
could
produce
rain
avert
pestilence
famine
and
death
in
all
its
forms
there
was
no
idea
of
the
certain
all
depended
upon
divine
pleasure
or
displeasure
rather
heaven
was
full
of
inconsistent
malevolence
and
earth
of
ignorance
everything
was
done
to
appease
the
divine
wrath
every
public
calamity
was
caused
by
the
sins
of
the
people
by
a
failure
to
pay
tithes
or
for
having
even
in
secret
felt
a
disrespect
for
a
priest
to
the
poor
multitude
the
earth
was
a
kind
of
enchanted
forest
full
of
demons
ready
to
devour
and
theological
serpents
lurking
with
infinite
power
to
fascinate
and
torture
the
unhappy
and
impotent
soul
life
to
them
was
a
dim
and
mysterious
labyrinth
in
which
they
wandered
weary
and
lost
guided
by
priests
as
bewildered
as
themselves
without
knowing
that
at
every
step
the
ariadne
of
reason
offered
them
the
long
lost
clue
the
very
heavens
were
full
of
death
the
lightning
was
regarded
as
the
glittering
vengeance
of
god
and
the
earth
was
thick
with
snares
for
the
unwary
feet
of
man
the
soul
was
supposed
to
be
crowded
with
the
wild
beasts
of
desire
the
heart
to
be
totally
corrupt
prompting
only
to
crime
virtues
were
regarded
as
deadly
sins
in
disguise
there
was
a
continual
warfare
being
waged
between
the
deity
and
the
devil
for
the
possession
of
every
soul
the
latter
generally
being
considered
victorious
the
flood
the
tornado
the
volcano
were
all
evidences
of
the
displeasure
of
heaven
and
the
sinfulness
of
man
the
blight
that
withered
the
frost
that
blackened
the
earthquake
that
devoured
were
the
messengers
of
the
creator
the
world
was
governed
by
fear
against
all
the
evils
of
nature
there
was
known
only
the
defense
of
prayer
of
fasting
of
credulity
and
devotion
man
in
his
helplessness
endeavored
to
soften
the
heart
of
god
the
faces
of
the
multitude
were
blanched
with
fear
and
wet
with
tears
they
were
the
prey
of
hypocrites
kings
and
priests
my
heart
bleeds
when
i
contemplate
the
sufferings
endured
by
the
millions
now
dead
of
those
who
lived
when
the
world
appeared
to
be
insane
when
the
heavens
were
filled
with
an
infinite
horror
who
snatched
babes
with
dimpled
hands
and
rosy
cheeks
from
the
white
breasts
of
mothers
and
dashed
them
into
an
abyss
of
eternal
flame
slowly
beautifully
like
the
coming
of
the
dawn
came
the
grand
truth
that
the
universe
is
governed
by
law
that
disease
fastens
itself
upon
the
good
and
upon
the
bad
that
the
tornado
can
not
be
stopped
by
counting
beads
that
the
rushing
lava
pauses
not
for
bended
knees
the
lightning
for
clasped
and
uplifted
hands
nor
the
cruel
waves
of
the
sea
for
prayer
that
paying
tithes
causes
rather
than
prevents
famine
that
pleasure
is
not
sin
that
happiness
is
the
only
good
that
demons
and
gods
exist
only
in
the
imagination
that
faith
is
a
lullaby
sung
to
put
the
soul
to
sleep
that
devotion
is
a
bribe
that
fear
offers
to
supposed
power
that
offering
rewards
in
another
world
for
obedience
in
this
is
simply
buying
a
soul
on
credit
that
knowledge
consists
in
ascertaining
the
laws
of
nature
and
that
wisdom
is
the
science
of
happiness
slowly
grandly
beautifully
these
truths
are
dawning
upon
mankind
from
copernicus
we
learned
that
this
earth
is
only
a
grain
of
sand
on
the
infinite
shore
of
the
universe
that
everywhere
we
are
surrounded
by
shining
worlds
vastly
greater
than
our
own
all
moving
and
existing
in
accordance
with
law
true
the
earth
began
to
grow
small
but
man
began
to
grow
great
the
moment
the
fact
was
established
that
other
worlds
are
governed
by
law
it
was
only
natural
to
conclude
that
our
little
world
was
also
under
its
dominion
the
old
theological
method
of
accounting
for
physical
phenomena
by
the
pleasure
and
displeasure
of
the
deity
was
by
the
intellectual
abandoned
they
found
that
disease
death
life
thought
heat
cold
the
seasons
the
winds
the
dreams
of
man
the
instinct
of
animals
in
short
that
all
physical
and
mental
phenomena
are
governed
by
law
absolute
eternal
and
inexorable
let
it
be
understood
by
the
term
law
is
meant
the
same
invariable
relations
of
succession
and
resemblance
predicated
of
all
facts
springing
from
like
conditions
law
is
a
fact
not
a
cause
it
is
a
fact
that
like
conditions
produce
like
results
this
fact
is
law
when
we
say
that
the
universe
is
governed
by
law
we
mean
that
this
fact
called
law
is
incapable
of
change
that
it
is
has
been
and
forever
will
be
the
same
inexorable
immutable
fact
inseparable
from
all
phenomena
law
in
this
sense
was
not
enacted
or
made
it
could
not
have
been
otherwise
than
as
it
is
that
which
necessarily
exists
has
no
creator
only
a
few
years
ago
this
earth
was
considered
the
real
center
of
the
universe
all
the
stars
were
supposed
to
revolve
around
this
insignificant
atom
the
german
mind
more
than
any
other
has
done
away
with
this
piece
of
egotism
purbach
and
mullerus
in
the
fifteenth
century
contributed
most
to
the
advancement
of
astronomy
in
their
day
to
the
latter
the
world
is
indebted
for
the
introduction
of
decimal
fractions
which
completed
our
arithmetical
notation
and
formed
the
second
of
the
three
steps
by
which
in
modern
times
the
science
of
numbers
has
been
so
greatly
improved
and
yet
both
of
these
men
believed
in
the
most
childish
absurdities
at
least
in
enough
of
them
to
die
without
their
orthodoxy
having
ever
been
questioned
next
came
the
great
copernicus
and
he
stands
at
the
head
of
the
heroic
thinkers
of
his
time
who
had
the
courage
and
the
mental
strength
to
break
the
chains
of
prejudice
custom
and
authority
and
to
establish
truth
on
the
basis
of
experience
observation
and
reason
he
removed
the
earth
so
to
speak
from
the
center
of
the
universe
and
ascribed
to
it
a
twofold
motion
and
demonstrated
the
true
position
which
it
occupies
in
the
solar
system
at
his
bidding
the
earth
began
to
revolve
at
the
command
of
his
genius
it
commenced
its
grand
flight
amid
the
eternal
constellations
around
the
sun
for
fifty
years
his
discoveries
were
disregarded
all
at
once
by
the
exertions
of
galileo
they
were
kindled
into
so
grand
a
conflagration
as
to
consume
the
philosophy
of
aristotle
to
alarm
the
hierarchy
of
rome
and
to
threaten
the
existence
of
every
opinion
not
founded
upon
experience
observation
and
reason
the
earth
was
no
longer
considered
a
universe
governed
by
the
caprices
of
some
revengeful
deity
who
had
made
the
stars
out
of
what
he
had
left
after
completing
the
world
and
had
stuck
them
in
the
sky
simply
to
adorn
the
night
i
have
said
this
much
concerning
astronomy
because
it
was
the
first
splendid
step
forward
the
first
sublime
blow
that
shattered
the
lance
and
shivered
the
shield
of
superstition
the
first
real
help
that
man
received
from
heaven
because
it
was
the
first
great
lever
placed
beneath
the
altar
of
a
false
religion
the
first
revelation
of
the
infinite
to
man
the
first
authoritative
declaration
that
the
universe
is
governed
by
law
the
first
science
that
gave
the
lie
direct
to
the
cosmogony
of
barbarism
and
because
it
is
the
sublimest
victory
that
reason
has
achieved
in
speaking
of
astronomy
i
have
confined
myself
to
the
discoveries
made
since
the
revival
of
learning
long
ago
on
the
banks
of
the
ganges
ages
before
copernicus
lived
aryabhatta
taught
that
the
earth
is
a
sphere
and
revolves
on
its
own
axis
this
however
does
not
detract
from
the
glory
of
the
great
german
the
discovery
of
the
hindoo
had
been
lost
in
the
midnight
of
europe
in
the
age
of
faith
and
copernicus
was
as
much
a
discoverer
as
though
aryabhatta
had
never
lived
in
this
short
address
there
is
no
time
to
speak
of
other
sciences
and
to
point
out
the
particular
evidence
furnished
by
each
to
establish
the
dominion
of
law
nor
to
more
than
mention
the
name
of
descartes
the
first
who
undertook
to
give
an
explanation
of
the
celestial
motions
or
who
formed
the
vast
and
philosophic
conception
of
reducing
all
the
phenomena
of
the
universe
to
the
same
law
of
montaigne
one
of
the
heroes
of
common
sense
of
galvani
whose
experiments
gave
the
telegraph
to
the
world
of
voltaire
who
contributed
more
than
any
other
of
the
sons
of
men
to
the
destruction
of
religious
intolerance
of
august
comte
whose
genius
erected
to
itself
a
monument
that
still
touches
the
stars
of
guttenberg
watt
stephenson
arkwright
all
soldiers
of
science
in
the
grand
army
of
the
dead
kings
the
glory
of
science
is
that
it
is
freeing
the
the
mental
manacles
getting
the
brain
out
of
bondage
giving
courage
to
thought
filling
the
world
with
mercy
justice
and
joy
science
found
agriculture
plowing
with
a
stick
reaping
with
a
sickle
commerce
at
the
mercy
of
the
treacherous
waves
and
the
inconstant
winds
a
world
without

without

man
denying
the
authority
of
reason
employing
his
ingenuity
in
the
manufacture
of

and

it
found
the
land
filled
with
malicious
monks
with
persecuting

and
the

it
found
a
world
full
of
fear

greatest
virtue

in

to
tell
their
fortunes
by
signs
and
wonders
generals
thinking
to
conquer
their
enemies
by
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
or
by
telling
a
rosary
it
found
all
history
full
of
petty
and
ridiculous
falsehood
and
the
almighty

supposed
to
spend
most
of
his
time
turning
sticks
into
snakes
drowning
boys
for
swimming
on
sunday
and
killing
little
children
for
the
purpose
of
converting
their

it
found
the
earth
filled
with
slaves
and
tyrants
the
people
in
all
countries
downtrodden
half
naked
half
starved
without
hope
and
without
reason
in
the
world
such
was
the
condition
of
man
when
the
morning
of
science
dawned
upon
his
brain
and
before
he
had
heard
the
sublime
declaration
that
the
universe
is
governed
by
law
for
the
change
that
has
taken
place
we
are
indebted
solely
to
science
the

no
wonder
that
fable
is
the
enemy
of

a

with
a

the

it
is
upon
this
principle
that

at

humboldt
the
serene
leader
of
an
intellectual
host
a
king
by
the
suffrage
of
science
and
the
divine
right
of
genius

today
we

some
butcher
called
a
soldier
some
wily
politician
called
a
statesman
some
robber
called
a
king
nor
some
malicious
metaphysician
called

we
are
honoring
the
grand
humboldt
whose
victories
were
all
achieved
in
the
arena
of
thought
who
destroyed
prejudice
ignorance
and

not
men
who

not

and
who
contributed

the

happiness
of
all
mankind
his
life
was
pure
his
aims
lofty
his
learning
varied
and
profound
and
his
achievements
vast
we
honor
him
because
he
has
ennobled
our
race
because
he
has
contributed
as
much
as
any
man
living
or
dead
to
the
real
prosperity
of
the
world
we
honor
him
because
he
honored
us
because
he
labored
for
others
because
he
was
the
most
learned
man
of
the
most
learned
nation
because
he
left
a
legacy
of
glory
to
every
human
being
for
these
reasons
he
is
honored
throughout
the
world
millions
are
doing
homage
to
his
genius
at
this
moment
and
millions
are
pronouncing
his
name
with
reverence
and
recounting
what
he
accomplished
we
associate
the
name
of
humboldt
with
oceans
continents
mountains
and
volcanoes
with
the
great
plains
the
wide
deserts
the
craters
of
the
andes
with
primeval
forests
and
european
capitals
with
wildernesses
and

with

with

with

progress
of

with
every
science
known
to
man
and
with
every
star
glittering
in
the
immensity
of

humboldt
adopted
none
of
the
creeds
of
his
day
wasted
none
of
his
time
in
the
stupidities
inanities
and
contradictions
of
theological
metaphysics
he
did
not
endeavor
to
harmonize
the
astronomy
and
geology
of
a
barbarous
people
with
the
science
of
the
nineteenth
century
never
for
one
moment
did
he
abandon
the
sublime
standard
of
truth
he
investigated
he
studied
he
thought
he
separated
the
gold
from
the
dross
in
the
crucible
of
his
grand
brain
he
was
never
found
on
his
knees
before
the
altar
of
superstition
he
stood
erect
by
the
grand
tranquil
column
of
reason
he
was
an
admirer
a
lover
an
adorer
of
nature
and
at
the
age
of
ninety
bowed
by
the
weight
of
nearly
a
century
covered
with
the
insignia
of
honor
loved
by
a
nation
respected
by
a
world
with
kings
for
his
servants
he
laid
his
weary
head
upon
her
bosom
upon
the
bosom
of
the
universal
mother
and
with
her
loving
arms
around
him
sank
into
that
slumber
called
death
history
added
another
name
to
the
starry
scroll
of
the
immortals
the
world
is
his
monument
upon
the
eternal
granite
of
her
hills
he
inscribed
his

there
upon
everlasting
stone
his
genius
wrote
this
the
sublimest
of
truths
the

is
governed
by

ingersoll
lecture
on
which
way
ladies
and
gentlemen
for
thousands
of
years
men
have
been
asking
the
questions
how
shall
we
civilize
the
world
how
shall
we
protect
life
liberty
property
and
reputations
how
shall
we
do
away
with
crime
and
poverty
how
clothe
and
feed
and
educate
and
civilize
mankind
these
are
the
questions
that
are
asked
by
thoughtful
men
and
thoughtful
women
the
question
with
them
is
not
what
will
we
do
in
some
other
world
time
enough
to
ask
that
when
we
get
there
the
business
we
will
attend
to
now
is
how
are
we
to
civilize
the
world
what
priest
shall
i
ask
what
sacred
volume
shall
i
search
what
oracle
can
i
consult
at
what
shrine
must
i
bow
to
find
out
what
is
to
be
done
each
church
has
a
different
answer
each
has
a
different
recipe
for
the
salvation
of
the
people
but
not
while
they
are
in
this
world
all
that
is
to
be
done
in
this
world
is
to
get
ready
for
the
next
in
the
first
place
i
am
met
by
the
theological
world
have
i
the
right
to
inquire
they
say
certainly
it
is
your
duty
to
inquire
each
church
has
a
recipe
for
the
salvation
of
this
world
but
not
while
you
are
in
this
world
afterward
they
treat
time
as
a
kind
of
pier
a
kind
of
wharf
running
out
into
the
great
ocean
of
eternity
and
they
treat
us
all
as
though
we
were
waiting
there
sitting
on
our
trunks
for
the
gospel
ship
i
want
to
know
what
to
do
here
have
i
the
right
to
inquire
yes
if
i
have
the
right
to
inquire
then
i
have
the
right
to
investigate
if
i
have
the
right
to
investigate
i
have
the
right
to
accept
if
i
have
the
right
to
accept
i
have
the
right
to
reject
and
what
religion
have
i
the
right
to
reject
that
which
does
not
conform
with
my
reason
with
my
standard
of
truth
with
my
standard
of
common
sense
millions
of
men
have
been
endeavoring
to
govern
this
world
by
means
of
the
supernatural
thousands
and
thousands
of
churches
exist
thousands
of
cathedrals
and
temples
have
been
built
millions
of
men
have
been
engaged
to
preach
this
gospel
and
what
has
been
the
result
in
this
world
will
one
church
have
any
sympathy
with
another
does
the
religion
of
one
country
have
any
respect
for
that
of
another
or
does
not
each
religion
claim
to
be
the
only
one
and
does
not
the
priest
of
every
religion
with
infinite
impudence
consign
the
disciples
of
all
others
to
eternal
fire
why
is
it
the
churches
have
failed
to
civilize
this
world
why
is
it
that
the
christian
countries
are
no
better
than
any
other
countries
why
is
it
that
christian
men
are
no
better
than
any
other
men
why
is
it
that
ministers
as
a
class
are
no
better
than
doctors
or
lawyers
or
merchants
or
mechanics
or
locomotive
engineers
and
a
locomotive
engineer
is
a
thousand
times
more
useful
give
me
a
good
engineer
and
a
bad
preacher
to
go
through
this
world
with
rather
than
a
bad
engineer
and
a
good
preacher
and
there
is
this
curious
fact
about
the
believers
in
the
supernatural
the
priests
of
one
church
have
no
confidence
in
the
miracles
and
wonders
told
by
the
priests
of
the
other
churches
maybe
they
know
each
other
a
christian
missionary
will
tell
the
hindoo
of
the
miracles
of
the
bible
the
hindoo
smiles
the
hindoo
tells
the
christian
missionary
of
the
miracles
of
his
sacred
books
and
the
missionary
looks
upon
him
with
pity
and
contempt
no
priest
takes
the
word
of
another
i
heard
once
a
little
story
that
illustrates
this
point
a
gentleman
in
a
little
party
was
telling
of
a
most
wonderful
occurrence
and
when
he
had
finished
everybody
said
is
it
possible
why
did
you
ever
hear
anything
like
that
all
united
in
a
kind
of
wondering
chorus
except
one
man
he
said
nothing
he
was
perfectly
still
and
unmoved
and
one
who
had
been
greatly
astonished
by
the
story
said
to
him
did
you
hear
that
story
yes
well
you
do
appear
to
be
excited
well
no
he
said
i
am
a
liar
myself
there
is
another
trouble
with
the
supernatural
it
has
no
honesty
it
is
consumed
by
egotism
it
does
not
think
it
knows
consequently
it
has
no
patience
with
the
honest
doubter
and
how
has
the
church
treated
the
honest
doubter
he
has
been
answered
by
force
by
authority
by
popes
by
cardinals
and
bishops
and
councils
and
above
all
by
mobs
in
that
way
the
honest
doubter
has
been
answered
there
is
this
difference
between
the
minister
the
church
the
clergy
and
the
men
who
believe
in
this
world
i
might
as
well
state
the
question
i
may
go
further
than
you
the
real
question
is
this
are
we
to
be
governed
by
a
supernatural
being
or
are
we
to
govern
ourselves
that
is
the
question
is
god
the
source
of
power
or
does
all
authority
spring
in
governing
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
that
is
the
question
in
other
words
is
the
universe
a
monarchy
a
despotism
or
a
democracy
i
take
the
democratic
side
not
in
a
political
sense
the
question
is
whether
this
world
should
be
governed
by
god
or
by
man
and
when
i
say
god
i
mean
the
being
that
these
gentlemen
have
treated
and
enthroned
upon
the
ignorance
of
mankind
now
let
us
admit
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
bible
is
true
let
us
admit
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
once
governed
this
world
not
that
he
did
but
let
us
admit
it
and
i
intend
to
speak
of
no
god
but
our
god
because
we
all
insist
that
of
all
the
gods
ours
is
the
best
and
if
he
is
not
good
we
need
not
trouble
ourselves
about
the
others
let
them
take
care
of
themselves
now
the
first
question
is
whether
this
world
shall
be
governed
by
god
or
man
admitting
that
the
being
spoken
of
in
the
bible
is
god
he
governed
this
world
once
there
was
a
theocracy
at
the
start
that
was
the
first
government
of
the
world
now
how
do
you
judge
of
a
man
the
best
test
of
a
man
is
how
does
he
use
power
that
is
the
supreme
test
of
manhood
how
does
he
treat
those
within
his
control
the
greater
the
man
the
grander
the
man
the
more
careful
he
is
in
the
use
of
power
the
tenderer
he
is
the
nearer
just
the
greater
the
more
merciful
the
grander
the
more
charitable
tell
me
how
a
man
treats
his
wife
or
his
children
his
poor
debtors
his
servants
and
i
will
tell
you
what
manner
of
a
man
he
be
that
i
say
is
the
supreme
test
and
we
know
tonight
how
a
good
and
great
man
treats
his
inferiors
we
know
that
and
a
man
endeavoring
to
raise
his
higher
in
the
scale
of
civilization
what
will
that
man
appeal
to
will
he
appeal
to
the
lowest
or
to
the
highest
that
is
in
man
let
us
be
honest
will
he
appeal
to
prejudice
the
fortress
the
armor
the
sword
and
shield
of
ignorance
will
he
appeal
to
credulity
the
ring
in
the
nose
by
which
priests
lead
stupidity
will
he
appeal
to
the
cowardly
man
will
he
play
upon
his
fears
fear
the
capital
stock
of
imposture
the
lever
and
fulcrum
of
hypocrisy
will
he
appeal
to
the
selfishness
and
all
the
slimy
serpents
that
crawl
in
the
den
of
savagery
or
will
he
appeal
to
reason
the
torch
of
the
mind
will
he
appeal
to
justice
will
he
appeal
to
charity
which
is
justice
in
blossom
will
he
appeal
to
liberty
and
love
these
are
the
questions
what
will
he
do
what
did
our
god
do
let
us
see
the
first
thing
we
know
of
him
is
in
the
garden
of
eden
how
did
he
endeavor
to
make
his
children
great
and
strong
and
good
and
free
did
he
say
anything
to
adam
and
eve
about
the
sacred
relation
of
marriage
did
he
say
anything
to
them
about
loving
children
did
he
say
anything
to
them
about
learning
anything
under
heaven
did
he
say
one
word
about
intellectual
liberty
did
he
say
one
word
about
reason
or
about
justice
did
he
make
the
slightest
effort
to
improve
them
all
that
he
did
in
the
world
was
to
give
them
one
poor
little
miserable
barren
command
thou
shalt
not
eat
of
a
certain
fruit
that
all
that
amounted
to
anything
and
when
they
sinned
did
this
great
god
take
them
in
the
arms
of
his
love
and
endeavor
to
reform
them
no
he
simply
put
upon
them
a
curse
when
they
were
expelled
he
said
to
the
woman
i
will
greatly
multiply
thy
sorrow
in
sorrow
shalt
thou
bring
forth
children
thy
husband
shall
rule
over
thee
god
made
every
mother
a
criminal
and
placed
a
perpetual
penalty
of
pain
upon
human
love
our
god
made
wives
slaves
slaves
of
their
husbands
our
god
corrupted
the
marriage
relation
and
paralyzed
the
firesides
of
this
world
that
is
what
our
god
did
and
what
did
he
say
to
poor
adam
cursed
be
the
ground
for
thy
sake
in
sorrow
shalt
thou
eat
of
it
all
the
days
of
thy
life
thorns
and
thistles
shall
it
bring
forth
to
thee
and
thou
shalt
eat
the
herb
of
the
field
and
in
the
sweat
of
thy
face
shalt
thou
eat
bread
did
he
say
one
word
calculated
to
make
him
a
better
man
did
he
put
in
the
horizon
of
the
future
one
star
of
hope
let
us
be
honest
and
see
what
this
god
did
and
we
will
judge
of
him
simply
by
ordinary
common
sense
after
a
while
cain
murdered
his
brother
and
he
was
detected
by
this
god
and
what
did
this
god
say
to
him
did
he
say
one
word
of
the
crime
of
shedding
human
blood
not
a
word
did
he
say
one
word
calculated
to
excite
in
the
breast
of
cain
the
slightest
real
sorrow
for
his
deed
not
the
slightest
did
he
tell
him
anything
about
where
abel
was
nothing
did
he
endeavor
to
make
him
a
better
man
not
a
bit
what
had
he
ever
taught
him
before
on
that
subject
nothing
and
so
cain
went
out
to
the
other
sons
and
daughters
of
adam
according
to
the
bible
and
they
multiplied
and
increased
until
they
covered
the
earth
god
gave
them
no
code
of
laws
god
never
built
them
a
schoolhouse
god
never
sent
a
teacher
god
never
said
a
word
to
them
about
a
future
state
god
never
held
up
before
their
gaze
that
dazzling
reward
of
heaven
never
spoke
about
the
lurid
gulfs
of
hell
kept
divine
punishment
a
perfect
secret
and
without
having
given
them
the
slightest
opportunity
simply
drowned
the
world
splendid
administration
cleveland
will
do
better
than
that
and
after
the
waters
had
gone
away
then
he
gave
them
some
commandments
i
suppose
that
he
saw
by
that
time
that
they
needed
guidance
and
here
are
the
commandments
you
may
eat
all
kinds
of
birds
beasts
and
fishes
you
must
not
eat
blood
if
you
do
i
will
kill
you
whosoever
sheddeth
man
blood
by
man
shall
his
blood
be
shed
nothing
more
no
good
advice
not
a
word
about
government
not
a
word
about
the
rights
of
man
or
woman
or
children
not
a
word
about
any
law
of
nature
not
a
word
about
any
science
nothing
not
even
arithmetic
nothing
and
so
he
let
them
go
on
and
in
a
little
while
they
came
to
the
same
old
state
and
began
building
the
tower
of
babel
and
he
went
there
and
confounded
as
they
said
their
languages
never
said
a
word
to
them
never
told
them
how
foolish
it
was
to
try
and
reach
heaven
that
way
and
the
next
we
find
him
talking
to
abraham
and
with
abraham
he
makes
a
contract
and
how
did
he
do
it
i
will
bless
them
that
bless
thee
and
curse
them
that
curse
thee
fine
contract
for
a
god
and
thereupon
he
made
certain
promises
to
abraham
promised
to
give
him
the
whole
world
all
the
nations
round
about
and
that
his
seed
should
be
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
never
kept
one
of
his
promises
not
one
he
made
the
same
promises
to
isaac
and
broke
every
one
then
he
made
them
all
over
to
jacob
and
broke
every
one
made
them
again
to
moses
and
broke
them
all
never
said
a
word
about
anybody
behaving
themselves
not
a
word
finally
these
people
whom
he
had
taken
under
his
special
care
became
slaves
in
the
land
of
egypt
how
ashamed
god
must
have
been
finally
he
made
up
his
mind
to
rescue
them
from
that
servitude
and
he
sent
moses
and
aaron
he
never
said
a
word
to
moses
or
aaron
that
pharaoh
was
wrong
he
never
said
a
word
to
them
about
how
the
women
felt
when
their
male
children
were
taken
and
destroyed
he
simply
sent
moses
before
pharaoh
with
a
cane
in
his
hand
that
he
could
turn
into
a
serpent
and
when
pharaoh
called
in
magicians
and
they
did
the
same
pharaoh
laughed
and
then
they
made
frogs
and
pharaoh
sent
for
his
magicians
and
they
did
the
same
and
pharaoh
still
laughed
and
this
god
had
infinite
power
but
pharaoh
defeated
him
at
every
point
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
the
story
that
great
fenian
told
when
the
great
excitement
was
about
ireland
an
irishman
was
telling
about
the
condition
of
ireland
he
said
we
have
got
in
ireland
now
over
soldiers
all
equipped
every
man
of
them
has
got
a
musket
and
ammunition
they
are
ready
to
march
at
a
minute
notice
but
said
the
other
man
why
do
they
march
why
said
the
other
man
the
police
wo
let
them
how
admirable
imagine
the
infinite
god
endeavoring
to
liberate
the
hebrews
and
prevented
by
a
king
who
would
not
let
the
children
of
israel
go
until
he
had
done
some
little
miracles
with
sticks
think
of
it
but
said
christians
you
must
wait
a
little
while
if
you
wish
to
find
the
foundation
of
law
christians
now
assert
that
from
sinai
came
to
this
world
all
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
and
that
from
its
flaming
top
we
received
the
first
ideas
of
law
and
justice
let
us
look
at
those
ten
commandments
which
of
those
ten
commandments
were
new
and
which
of
those
ten
commandments
were
old
thou
shalt
not
kill
that
was
as
old
as
life
murder
has
been
a
crime
also
because
men
object
to
being
murdered
if
you
read
the
same
bible
you
will
find
that
moses
seeing
an
israelite
and
an
egyptian
contending
together
smote
the
egyptian
and
hid
his
body
in
the
sand
after
he
had
committed
that
crime
moses
fled
from
the
land
why
simply
because
there
was
a
law
against
murder
that
is
all
honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother
that
is
as
old
as
birth
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
that
is
as
old
as
sex
thou
shalt
not
steal
that
is
as
old
as
work
and
as
old
as
property
thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
against
thy
neighbor
that
is
as
old
as
the
earth
never
was
there
a
nation
never
was
there
a
tribe
on
the
earth
that
did
not
have
substantially
those
commandments
what
then
were
new
first
thou
shalt
worship
no
other
god
thou
shalt
have
no
other
god
why
because
i
am
a
jealous
god
second
thou
shalt
not
make
any
graven
image
third
thou
shalt
not
take
my
name
in
vain
fourth
thou
shalt
not
work
on
the
sabbath
day
what
use
were
these
commandments
none
not
the
slightest
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
if
god
from
sinai
instead
of
the
commandments
had
said
thou
shalt
not
enslave
thy
no
human
being
is
entitled
to
the
results
of
another
labor
suppose
he
had
said
thou
shalt
not
persecute
for
opinion
sake
thought
and
speech
must
be
forever
free
suppose
he
had
said
instead
of
thou
shalt
not
work
on
the
sabbath
day
a
man
shall
have
but
one
wife
a
woman
shall
have
but
one
husband
husbands
shall
love
their
wives
wives
shall
love
their
husbands
and
their
children
with
all
their
hearts
and
as
themselves
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
for
this
world
long
before
moses
was
born
the
egyptians
taught
one
god
but
afterwards
i
believe
in
their
weakness
they
degenerated
into
a
belief
in
the
trinity
they
taught
the
divine
origin
of
the
soul
and
taught
judgment
after
death
they
taught
as
a
reward
for
belief
in
their
doctrine
eternal
joy
and
as
a
punishment
for
eternal
pain
egypt
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
far
better
governed
than
palestine
the
laws
of
egypt
were
better
than
the
laws
of
god
in
egypt
woman
was
equal
with
man
long
before
moses
was
born
there
were
queens
upon
the
egyptian
throne
long
before
moses
was
born
they
had
a
written
code
of
laws
and
their
laws
were
administered
by
courts
and
judges
they
had
rules
of
evidence
they
understood
the
philosophy
of
damages
long
before
moses
was
born
they
had
asylums
for
the
insane
and
hospitals
for
the
sick
long
before
god
appeared
on
sinai
there
were
schools
in
egypt
and
the
highest
office
next
to
the
throne
was
opened
to
the
successful
scholar
the
egyptian
married
but
one
wife
his
wife
was
called
the
lady
of
the
house
women
were
not
secluded
and
above
all
and
over
all
the
people
of
egypt
were
not
divided
into
castes
and
were
infinitely
better
governed
than
god
ever
thought
of
i
am
speaking
of
the
god
of
this
bible
if
moses
had
remembered
more
of
what
he
saw
in
egypt
his
government
would
have
been
far
better
than
it
was
long
before
these
commandments
were
given
zoroaster
taught
the
hindoos
that
there
was
one
infinite
and
supreme
god
they
had
a
code
of
laws
and
their
laws
were
administered
by
judges
in
their
courts
by
those
laws
at
the
death
of
a
father
the
unmarried
daughter
received
twice
as
much
of
his
property
as
his
son
compare
those
laws
with
the
laws
of
moses
so
too
the
romans
had
their
code
of
laws
the
romans
were
the
greatest
lawyers
the
world
produced
the
romans
had
a
code
of
civil
laws
and
that
code
today
is
the
foundation
of
all
law
in
the
civilized
world
the
romans
built
temples
to
truth
to
faith
to
valor
to
concord
to
modesty
to
charity
and
to
chastity
and
so
with
the
grecians
and
yet
you
will
find
christian
ministers
today
contending
that
all
ideas
of
law
of
justice
and
of
right
came
from
sinai
from
the
ten
commandments
from
the
mosaic
laws
no
lawyer
who
understands
his
profession
will
claim
that
is
so
no
lawyer
who
has
studied
the
history
of
law
will
claim
it
no
man
who
knows
history
itself
will
claim
it
no
man
will
claim
it
but
an
ignorant
zealot
let
us
go
another
step
let
us
compare
the
ideas
of
this
god
with
the
ideas
of
uninspired
men
i
am
making
this
long
preface
because
i
want
to
get
it
out
of
your
minds
that
the
bible
is
inspired
now
let
us
go
along
a
little
and
see
what
is
god
opinion
of
liberty
nothing
is
of
more
value
in
this
world
today
than
liberty
liberty
of
body
and
liberty
of
mind
without
liberty
the
universe
would
be
as
a
dungeon
into
which
human
beings
are
flung
like
poor
and
miserable
convicts
intellectual
liberty
is
the
air
of
the
soul
the
sunshine
of
the
mind
without
it
we
should
be
in
darkness
now
jehovah
commanded
the
jewish
people
to
take
captives
the
strangers
and
sojourners
amongst
them
and
ordered
that
they
and
their
children
should
be
bondsmen
and
bondswomen
for
ever
now
let
us
compare
jehovah
to
epictetus
a
man
to
whom
no
revelation
was
ever
made
a
man
to
whom
this
god
did
not
appear
let
us
listen
to
him
remember
your
servants
are
to
be
treated
as
your
own
brothers
children
of
the
same
god
on
the
subject
of
liberty
is
not
epictetus
a
better
authority
than
jehovah
who
told
the
jews
to
make
bondsmen
and
bondswomen
of
the
heathen
round
about
and
he
said
they
were
to
make
them
their
bondsmen
and
bondswomen
forever
why
because
they
were
heathen
why
because
they
were
not
children
of
the
jews
he
was
the
god
of
the
jews
and
not
of
the
rest
of
mankind
so
he
said
to
his
chosen
people
pillage
upon
the
enemy
and
destroy
the
people
of
other
gods
buy
the
heathen
round
about
yet
cicero
a
poor
pagan
lawyer
said
this
and
he
had
not
even
read
the
old
testament
had
not
even
had
the
advantage
of
being
enlightened
by
the
prophets
they
who
say
that
we
should
love
our
and
not
foreigners
destroy
the
universal
brotherhood
of
mankind
and
with
it
benevolence
and
justice
would
perish
forever
is
not
cicero
greater
than
jehovah
the
bible
inspired
by
jehovah
says
if
a
man
smite
his
servant
with
a
rod
and
he
die
under
his
hand
he
shall
be
punished
it
he
continue
a
day
or
two
and
then
die
he
shall
not
be
punished
zeno
the
founder
of
the
stoics
who
had
never
heard
of
jehovah
and
never
read
a
word
of
moses
said
this
no
man
can
be
the
owner
of
another
and
the
title
is
bad
whether
the
slave
became
a
slave
by
conquest
or
by
purchase
the
title
is
bad
let
us
come
and
see
whether
jehovah
has
any
humanity
in
him
jehovah
ordered
the
jewish
general
to
make
war
and
this
was
the
order
and
when
the
lord
thy
god
shall
deliver
them
before
thee
thou
shalt
smite
them
and
utterly
destroy
them
thou
shalt
make
no
covenant
with
them
nor
show
mercy
unto
them
and
yet
epictetus
whom
i
have
already
quoted
said
treat
those
in
thy
power
as
thou
wouldst
have
thy
superiors
treat
thee
i
am
on
the
side
of
the
pagan
is
it
possible
that
a
being
of
infinite
goodness
said
i
will
heap
mischief
upon
them
i
will
send
my
arrows
upon
them
they
shall
be
burned
with
hunger
they
shall
be
devoured
with
burning
heat
and
with
bitter
destruction
i
will
also
send
the
teeth
of
locusts
upon
them
with
the
poisonous
serpent
of
the
desert
the
sound
without
and
the
terror
within
shall
destroy
both
the
young
men
and
the
virgins
the
sucklings
also
and
the
men
with
gray
hairs
while
seneca
a
poor
uninspired
roman
said
a
wise
man
will
not
pardon
any
crime
that
ought
to
be
punished
but
will
accomplish
in
other
way
all
that
is
sought
he
will
spare
some
he
will
pardon
and
watch
over
some
because
of
their
youth
he
will
pardon
these
on
account
of
their
ignorance
his
clemency
will
not
fail
what
is
sought
by
justice
but
his
clemency
will
fulfill
justice
that
was
said
by
seneca
can
we
believe
that
this
jehovah
said
let
his
children
be
fatherless
and
his
wife
a
widow
let
his
children
be
continually
vagabonds
and
beg
let
them
seek
their
bread
out
of
desolate
places
let
the
extortioner
catch
all
that
he
hath
and
let
the
stranger
spoil
his
labor
let
no
one
extend
mercy
unto
them
neither
let
any
favor
his
fatherless
children
did
jehovah
say
this
surely
he
had
never
heard
this
line
this
plaintive
music
from
the
hindoo
sweet
is
the
lute
to
those
who
have
not
heard
the
voices
of
their
own
children
let
us
see
the
generosity
of
jehovah
out
of
the
cloud
of
darkness
on
mount
sinai
he
said
to
the
jews
thou
shalt
have
no
other
god
before
me
thou
shalt
not
bow
down
to
any
other
gods
for
the
lord
thy
god
is
a
jealous
god
visiting
the
iniquities
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
to
the
third
an
fourth
generation
of
them
that
hate
me
just
think
of
god
saying
to
people
if
you
do
not
love
me
i
will
damn
you
contrast
this
with
the
words
put
by
the
hindoo
poet
into
the
mouth
of
brahma
i
am
the
same
to
all
mankind
the
who
honestly
worship
other
gods
involuntarily
worship
me
i
am
he
that
partaketh
of
all
worship
i
am
the
reward
of
worship
how
perfectly
sublime
let
me
read
it
to
you
again
i
am
the
same
to
all
mankind
they
who
honestly
worship
other
gods
involuntarily
worship
me
i
am
he
that
partaketh
of
all
worship
i
am
the
reward
of
worship
compare
these
passages
the
first
is
a
dungeon
which
crude
hands
have
digged
with
jealous
slime
the
other
is
like
the
dome
of
the
firmament
inlaid
with
constellations
is
it
possible
god
ever
said
if
a
prophet
deceive
when
he
hath
spoken
a
thing
i
the
lord
hath
deceived
that
prophet
compare
that
passage
with
the
poet
a
pagan
better
remain
silent
the
remainder
of
life
than
speak
falsely
can
we
believe
a
being
of
infinite
mercy
gave
this
command
put
every
man
his
sword
by
his
side
go
from
the
gate
throughout
the
camp
and
slay
every
man
his
brother
every
man
his
companion
and
every
man
his
neighbor
consecrate
it
yourselves
this
day
let
every
man
lay
his
sword
even
upon
his
son
upon
his
brother
that
he
bestow
blessing
upon
me
this
day
surely
that
was
not
the
outcome
of
a
great
magnanimous
spirit
like
that
of
the
roman
emperor
who
declared
i
had
rather
keep
a
single
roman
citizen
alive
than
slay
a
thousand
enemies
compare
the
last
command
given
to
the
children
of
israel
with
the
words
of
marcus
aurelius
i
have
formed
an
ideal
of
the
state
in
which
there
is
the
same
law
for
all
and
equal
rights
and
equal
liberty
of
speech
established
for
all
an
empire
where
nothing
is
honored
so
much
as
the
freedom
of
the
citizens
i
am
on
the
side
of
the
roman
emperor
what
is
more
beautiful
than
the
old
story
from
sufi
there
was
a
man
who
for
seven
years
did
every
act
of
good
every
kind
of
charity
and
at
the
end
of
the
seven
years
he
mounted
the
steps
to
the
gate
of
heaven
and
knocked
a
voice
cried
who
is
there
he
cried
thy
servant
o
lord
and
the
gates
were
shut
seven
other
years
he
did
every
good
work
and
again
mounted
the
steps
to
heaven
and
knocked
the
voice
cried
who
is
there
he
answered
thy
slave
o
god
and
the
gates
were
shut
seven
other
years
he
did
every
good
deed
and
again
mounted
the
steps
to
heaven
and
the
voice
said
who
is
there
he
replied
thyself
o
god
and
the
gates
wide
open
flew
is
there
anything
in
our
religion
so
warm
or
so
beautiful
as
that
compare
that
story
from
a
pagan
with
the
presbyterian
religion
take
this
story
of
endesthora
who
was
a
king
of
egypt
and
started
for
the
place
where
the
horizon
touched
the
earth
where
he
was
to
meet
god
with
him
followed
argune
and
bemis
and
traubation
they
were
taught
that
when
any
man
started
after
god
in
that
way
if
he
had
been
guilty
of
any
crime
he
would
fall
by
the
way
endesthora
walked
at
the
head
and
suddenly
he
missed
argune
he
said
he
was
not
always
merciful
in
the
hour
of
victory
a
little
while
after
he
missed
bemis
and
said
he
fought
not
so
much
for
the
rights
of
man
as
for
his
own
glory
a
little
farther
on
he
missed
traubation
he
said
my
god
i
know
no
reason
for
his
failing
to
reach
the
place
where
the
horizon
touches
the
earth
and
the
god
ram
appeared
to
him
and
opening
the
curtains
of
the
sky
said
to
him
enter
and
endesthora
said
but
where
are
my
brethren
where
are
argune
and
beinis
and
traubation
and
the
god
said
they
sinned
in
their
time
and
they
are
condemned
to
suffer
below
then
said
endestbora
i
do
not
wish
to
enter
into
your
heaven
without
my
friends
if
they
are
below
then
i
will
join
them
but
the
god
said
they
are
here
before
you
i
simply
said
this
to
try
your
soul
endesthora
simply
turned
and
said
but
what
of
my
dog
the
god
said
thou
knowest
that
if
the
shadow
of
a
dog
fall
upon
the
sacrifice
it
is
unclean
how
then
can
a
dog
enter
heaven
and
endesthora
replies
i
know
that
and
i
know
another
thing
that
ingratitude
is
the
blackest
of
crimes
whether
it
be
to
man
or
beast
that
dog
has
been
my
faithful
friend
he
has
followed
me
and
i
will
not
desert
even
him
and
the
god
said
let
the
dog
follow
compare
that
with
the
bible
stories
long
before
the
advent
of
christ
aristotle
said
we
should
conduct
ourselves
toward
others
as
we
would
have
them
conduct
themselves
toward
us
seneca
said
do
not
to
your
neighbor
what
you
would
not
have
your
neighbor
do
to
you
socrates
said
act
toward
others
as
you
would
have
others
act
toward
you
forgive
your
enemies
render
good
for
evil
and
kiss
even
the
hand
that
is
upraised
to
smite
krishna
said
cease
to
do
evil
aim
to
do
well
love
your
enemies
it
is
the
law
of
love
that
virtue
is
the
only
thing
that
has
strength
poor
miserable
pagans
did
you
ever
hear
anything
like
this
is
it
possible
that
one
of
the
authors
of
the
new
testament
was
inspired
when
he
said
that
man
was
not
created
for
woman
but
woman
for
man
epictetus
said
what
is
more
delightful
than
to
be
so
dear
to
your
wife
as
to
be
on
her
account
dearer
even
to
yourself
compare
that
with
paul
but
i
would
have
you
know
that
the
head
of
every
man
is
christ
and
the
head
of
the
woman
is
the
man
and
the
head
of
christ
is
god
wives
submit
yourselves
unto
your
husbands
as
unto
the
lord
that
was
inspiration
this
was
written
by
a
poor
despised
heathen
in
whatever
house
the
husband
is
contented
with
the
wife
and
the
wife
with
the
husband
in
that
house
will
fortune
dwell
in
the
house
where
the
woman
is
not
honored
let
the
curse
be
pronounced
where
the
wife
is
honored
there
god
is
truly
worshiped
i
wish
jehovah
had
said
something
like
that
from
sinai
is
there
anything
as
beautiful
as
this
in
the
new
testament
shall
i
tell
you
where
nature
is
more
blest
and
fair
it
is
where
those
we
love
abide
though
the
space
be
small
it
is
ample
as
earth
though
it
be
a
desert
through
it
run
the
rivers
of
paradise
compare
these
things
with
the
curses
pronounced
in
the
old
testament
where
you
read
of
the
heathen
being
given
over
to
butchery
and
death
and
the
women
and
babes
to
destruction
and
after
you
have
read
them
read
the
chapters
of
horrors
in
the
new
testament
threatening
eternal
fire
and
flame
and
then
read
this
the
greatest
thought
uttered
by
the
greatest
of
human
beings
the
quality
of
mercy
is
not
strained
it
droppeth
as
the
gentle
rain
from
heaven
upon
the
place
beneath
it
is
twice
blessed
it
blesseth
him
that
gives
and
him
that
takes
is
mightiest
in
the
mighty
it
becomes
the
throned
monarch
better
this
his
crown
compare
that
with
your
doctrine
of
the
new
testament
if
jehovah
was
an
infinite
god
and
knew
things
from
the
beginning
he
knew
that
his
bible
would
be
a
behind
which
tyranny
and
hypocrisy
would
crouch
and
knew
his
bible
would
be
the
on
which
the
mother
would
stand
while
her
babe
was
sold
from
her
because
he
knew
his
bible
would
be
quoted
by
tyrants
that
it
would
be
quoted
in
defense
of
robbers
called
kings
and
by
hypocrites
called
priests
he
knew
that
he
had
taught
the
jewish
people
he
knew
that
he
had
found
them
free
and
left
them
slaves
he
knew
that
he
had
broken
every
single
promise
made
to
them
he
knew
that
while
other
nations
advanced
in
knowledge
in
art
in
science
his
chosen
people
were
subjects
still
he
promised
them
the
world
he
gave
them
a
desert
he
promised
them
liberty
and
made
them
slaves
he
promised
them
power
he
gave
them
exile
and
any
one
who
reads
the
old
testament
is
compelled
to
say
that
nothing
could
add
to
their
misery
let
us
be
honest
how
do
you
account
for
this
religion
this
world
where
did
it
come
from
you
hear
every
minister
say
that
man
is
a
religious
animal
that
religion
is
natural
while
man
is
an
ignorant
animal
man
will
be
a
theological
animal
and
no
longer
where
did
we
get
this
religion
the
savage
knew
but
little
of
nature
but
thought
that
everything
happened
in
reference
to
him
he
thought
his
sins
caused
earthquakes
and
that
his
virtues
made
the
sunshine
nothing
is
so
egotistical
as
ignorance
you
know
and
so
do
i
that
if
no
human
being
existed
the
sun
would
shine
and
that
tempests
would
now
and
then
devastate
the
earth
violets
would
spread
their
velvet
bosoms
to
the
sun
daisies
would
grow
roses
would
fill
the
air
with
perfume
and
now
and
then
volcanoes
would
illuminate
the
horizon
with
their
lurid
glare
the
grass
would
grow
the
waters
would
run
and
so
far
as
nature
is
concerned
everything
would
be
as
joyous
as
though
the
earth
were
filled
with
happy
homes
we
know
the
barbarian
savage
thinks
that
all
this
was
on
his
account
he
thinks
that
there
dwelt
two
very
powerful
deities
that
there
was
a
good
one
because
he
knows
good
things
happen
to
him
and
that
there
was
a
bad
one
because
he
knows
bad
things
happen
to
him
behind
the
evil
influence
he
puts
a
devil
and
behind
the
good
an
intention
of
god
and
then
he
imagines
both
these
beings
are
in
opposition
and
that
between
them
they
struggle
for
the
possession
of
his
ignorant
soul
he
also
thinks
that
the
place
where
the
good
deity
lives
is
heaven
and
that
the
place
where
the
other
deity
keeps
himself
is
a
place
of
torture
and
punishment
and
about
that
time
other
barbarians
have
chosen
too
keep
the
ignorant
ones
in
subjection
by
means
of
the
doctrine
of
fear
and
punishment
there
is
no
reforming
power
in
fear
you
can
scare
a
man
maybe
so
bad
that
he
wo
do
a
thing
but
you
ca
scare
him
so
bad
he
want
to
do
it
there
is
no
reforming
power
in
punishment
or
brute
force
but
our
barbarians
rather
imagined
that
every
being
would
punish
in
accordance
with
his
power
and
his
dignity
and
that
god
would
subject
them
to
torture
in
the
same
way
as
those
who
made
him
angry
they
knew
the
king
would
inflict
torments
upon
one
in
his
power
and
they
supposed
that
god
would
inflict
torture
according
to
his
power
they
knew
the
worst
torture
was
a
slow
burning
fire
added
to
it
the
idea
of
eternity
and
hell
was
produced
that
was
their
idea
all
meanness
revenge
selfishness
cruelty
and
hatred
of
which
men
here
are
capable
burst
into
blossom
and
bore
fruit
in
that
one
word
hell
in
this
way
a
god
of
infinite
wisdom
experimented
with
man
keeping
him
between
an
outstretched
abyss
beneath
and
a
heaven
above
and
in
time
the
man
came
to
believe
that
he
could
please
god
by
having
read
a
few
sacred
books
could
count
beads
could
sprinkle
water
eat
little
square
pieces
of
bread
and
that
he
could
shut
his
eyes
and
say
words
to
the
clouds
but
the
moment
he
left
this
world
nothing
remained
except
to
damn
him
he
was
to
be
kept
miserable
one
day
in
seven
and
he
could
slander
and
persecute
other
men
all
the
other
days
in
the
week
that
was
the
chance
that
god
gave
a
man
here
but
the
moment
he
left
this
world
that
settled
it
he
would
go
to
eternal
pain
or
else
to
eternal
joy
that
was
the
way
that
the
supernatural
governed
this
world
through
fear
through
terror
through
eternity
of
punishment
and
that
government
i
say
tonight
has
failed
how
has
it
been
kept
alive
so
long
it
was
born
in
ignorance
let
me
tell
you
whoever
attacks
a
creed
will
be
confronted
with
a
list
of
great
men
who
have
believed
in
it
probably
their
belief
in
that
creed
was
the
only
weakness
they
had
but
he
will
be
asked
so
you
know
more
than
all
the
great
men
who
have
taught
and
all
the
respectable
men
who
have
believed
in
that
faith
for
the
church
is
always
going
about
to
get
a
certificate
from
some
governor
or
even
perhaps
members
of
the
legislature
and
you
are
told
because
believed
all
these
things
and
you
have
no
more
talents
than
they
that
you
should
believe
the
same
thing
but
i
contend
as
against
this
argument
that
you
should
not
take
the
testimony
of
these
men
unless
you
are
willing
to
take
at
the
same
time
all
their
beliefs
on
other
subjects
then
again
they
tell
you
that
the
rich
people
are
all
on
their
side
and
i
say
so
too
the
churches
today
seek
the
rich
and
poverty
unwillingly
seeks
them
light
thrown
from
diamonds
adorns
the
repentant
here
we
are
told
that
the
rich
the
fortunate
and
the
holders
of
place
are
christians
now
and
yet
ministers
grow
eloquent
over
the
poverty
of
christ
who
was
born
in
a
manger
and
say
that
the
holy
ghost
passed
the
titled
ladies
of
the
world
and
selected
the
wife
of
a
poor
mechanic
for
the
mother
of
god
such
is
the
difference
between
theory
and
practice
the
church
condemns
the
men
of
jerusalem
who
held
positions
and
who
held
the
pretensions
of
the
savior
in
contempt
they
admit
that
he
was
so
little
known
that
they
had
to
bribe
a
man
to
point
him
out
to
the
soldiers
they
assert
that
he
performed
miracles
yet
he
remained
absolutely
unknown
hidden
in
the
depth
of
obscurity
no
one
knew
him
and
one
of
his
disciples
had
to
be
bribed
to
point
him
out
surely
he
and
his
disciples
could
have
met
the
arguments
which
were
urged
against
their
religion
at
that
time
so
long
as
the
church
honored
philosophers
she
kept
her
great
men
in
the
majority
how
is
it
now
i
say
tonight
that
no
man
of
genius
in
the
world
is
in
the
orthodox
pulpit
so
far
as
i
know
where
are
they
where
are
the
orthodox
great
men
i
challenge
the
christian
church
to
produce
a
man
like
alexander
humboldt
i
challenge
the
world
to
produce
a
naturalist
like
haeckel
i
challenge
the
christian
world
to
produce
a
man
like
darwin
where
in
the
ranks
of
orthodoxy
are
historians
like
draper
and
buckle
where
are
the
naturalists
like
tyndall
philosophers
like
mills
and
spencer
and
women
like
george
eliot
and
harriet
martineau
you
may
get
tired
of
the
argument
but
the
names
of
the
great
thinkers
and
naturalists
and
scientists
of
our
time
can
not
be
matched
by
the
supernatural
world
what
is
the
next
argument
they
will
bring
forward
the
father
and
mother
argument
you
must
not
disgrace
your
parents
how
did
christ
come
to
leave
the
religion
of
his
mother
that
argument
proves
too
much
there
is
one
way
every
man
can
honor
his
mother
that
is
by
finding
out
more
than
she
knew
there
is
one
way
a
man
can
honor
his
father
by
correcting
the
old
man
errors
most
people
imagine
that
the
creed
we
have
came
from
the
brain
and
heart
of
christ
they
have
no
idea
how
it
was
made
they
think
it
was
all
made
at
one
time
they
do
understand
that
it
was
a
slow
growth
they
do
understand
that
theology
is
a
science
made
up
of
mistakes
prejudices
and
falsehoods
let
me
tell
you
a
few
facts
the
emperor
constantine
who
lifted
the
christian
religion
into
power
murdered
his
wife
and
his
eldest
son
the
very
year
that
he
convened
the
council
of
nice
to
decide
whether
jesus
christ
was
man
or
god
and
that
was
not
decided
until
the
year
of
grace
then
theodosius
called
a
council
at
constantinople
in
and
this
council
decided
that
the
holy
ghost
proceeded
from
the
father
you
see
there
was
a
little
doubt
on
that
question
before
this
was
done
then
another
council
was
called
later
to
determine
who
the
virgin
mary
really
was
and
it
was
solemnly
decided
that
she
was
the
mother
of
christ
in
and
then
in
a
council
was
held
in
chalcedon
by
the
emperor
marcian
and
that
decided
that
christ
had
two
natures
a
human
and
a
divine
in
another
council
was
held
at
constantinople
and
in
at
lyons
it
was
decided
that
the
holy
ghost
proceeded
not
only
from
the
father
but
from
the
son
and
when
you
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
a
belief
in
the
trinity
is
absolutely
essential
to
salvation
you
see
how
important
it
was
that
these
doctrines
should
have
been
established
in
when
millions
of
people
had
dropped
into
hell
in
the
interim
solely
because
they
had
forgotten
that
question
at
last
we
know
how
religions
are
made
we
know
how
miracles
are
manufactured
we
know
the
history
of
relics
and
bones
and
pieces
of
the
true
cross
and
at
last
we
understand
apostolic
succession
at
last
we
have
examined
other
religions
and
we
find
them
all
the
same
and
we
are
beginning
to
suspect
that
ours
is
like
the
rest
i
think
we
understand
it
i
read
a
little
story
a
short
time
ago
from
the
japanese
that
throws
light
upon
the
question
there
was
an
old
priest
at
a
monastery
this
monastery
was
built
over
the
bones
of
what
he
called
a
saint
and
people
came
there
and
were
cured
of
many
diseases
this
priest
had
an
assistant
after
the
assistant
grew
up
and
got
quite
to
understand
his
business
the
old
priest
gave
him
a
little
donkey
and
told
him
that
henceforth
he
was
to
take
care
of
himself
the
young
priest
started
out
with
his
little
donkey
and
asked
alms
of
those
he
met
few
gave
to
him
finally
he
got
very
poor
he
could
not
raise
money
enough
to
feed
the
donkey
finally
the
donkey
died
he
was
about
to
bury
it
when
a
thought
occurred
to
him
he
buried
the
donkey
and
sat
down
on
the
grave
and
to
the
next
stranger
that
passed
he
said
will
you
not
give
a
little
money
to
erect
a
shrine
over
the
bones
of
a
sinless
one
thereupon
a
man
gave
money
others
followed
his
example
a
shrine
was
raised
and
in
a
little
while
a
monastery
was
built
over
the
bones
of
the
sinless
one
down
in
the
grave
the
young
priest
made
an
orifice
so
that
persons
afflicted
with
any
disease
could
reach
down
and
touch
the
bones
of
the
sinless
one
hundreds
were
thus
cured
and
persons
left
their
crutches
as
testimonials
to
the
miraculous
power
of
the
bones
of
the
sinless
one
finally
the
priest
became
so
rich
that
he
thought
he
would
visit
his
old
master
he
went
to
the
old
monastery
with
a
fine
retinue
his
old
master
asked
him
how
he
became
so
rich
and
prosperous
he
replied
old
age
is
stupid
but
youth
has
thought
later
on
he
explained
to
the
old
priest
how
the
donkey
had
died
and
how
he
had
raised
a
monastery
over
the
bones
of
the
sinless
one
and
again
reminded
him
that
old
age
is
stupid
but
youth
has
thought
the
old
priest
exclaimed
not
quite
so
fast
young
man
not
quite
so
fast
do
imagine
you
worked
out
anything
new
this
shrine
of
mine
is
built
over
the
bones
of
the
mother
of
your
little
donkey
we
have
now
reached
a
point
in
the
history
of
the
world
when
we
know
that
theocracy
as
a
form
of
government
is
a
failure
and
we
see
that
theology
as
a
foundation
of
government
is
an
absolute
failure
we
can
see
that
theocracy
and
theology
created
not
liberty
but
despotism
we
know
enough
of
the
history
of
the
churches
in
this
world
to
know
that
they
never
can
civilize
mankind
that
they
are
not
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
progress
that
they
are
not
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
justice
and
mercy
what
i
ask
you
tonight
is
what
has
the
church
done
to
civilize
mankind
what
has
the
church
done
for
us
how
has
it
added
to
the
prosperity
of
this
world
has
it
ever
produced
anything
nothing
why
they
say
it
has
been
charitable
how
can
a
beggar
be
charitable
a
beggar
produces
nothing
the
church
has
been
an
eternal
and
everlasting
pauper
it
is
not
charitable
it
is
an
object
of
charity
and
yet
it
claims
to
be
charitable
the
giver
is
the
charitable
one
somebody
who
has
made
something
somebody
who
has
by
his
labor
produced
something
he
alone
can
be
charitable
and
let
me
say
another
thing
the
church
is
always
on
the
wrong
side
let
us
take
first
the
episcopal
church
if
you
call
that
a
church
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
about
that
church
you
know
what
is
called
the
rebellion
in
england
in
do
you
know
what
caused
it
i
will
tell
you
king
james
was
a
catholic
and
notwithstanding
that
fact
he
issued
an
edict
of
toleration
for
the
dissenters
and
catholics
and
what
next
did
he
do
he
ordered
all
the
bishops
to
have
this
edict
of
toleration
read
in
the
episcopal
churches
they
refused
to
do
it
most
of
them
you
recollect
that
trial
of
the
seven
bishops
that
is
what
it
was
all
about
they
would
not
read
the
edict
of
toleration
then
what
happened
a
strange
thing
to
say
and
it
is
one
of
the
miracles
of
this
world
the
dissenters
in
whose
favor
that
edict
was
issued
joined
hands
with
the
episcopalians
and
raised
the
rebellion
against
the
king
because
he
wanted
to
give
the
dissenters
liberty
and
these
dissenters
and
these
episcopalians
on
account
of
toleration
drove
king
james
into
exile
this
is
the
history
of
the
first
rebellion
the
church
of
england
ever
raised
against
the
king
simply
because
he
issued
an
edict
of
toleration
and
the
poor
miserable
wretches
in
whose
favor
the
edict
was
issued
joined
hands
with
their
oppressors
i
want
to
show
you
how
much
the
church
of
england
has
done
for
england
i
get
it
from
good
authority
let
me
read
it
to
you
to
show
how
little
influence
the
christian
church
the
church
of
england
had
with
the
government
of
that
country
let
me
tell
you
that
up
to
the
reign
of
george
there
were
in
that
country
offenses
punishable
with
death
there
is
not
a
lawyer
in
this
city
who
can
think
of
those
offenses
and
write
them
down
in
one
day
think
of
it
offenses
punishable
with
death
now
between
the
accession
of
george
and
the
termination
of
the
reign
of
george
iii
there
were
added
new
crimes
punishable
with
death
making
in
all
crimes
in
england
punishable
with
death
there
is
no
lawyer
in
this
state
who
can
think
of
that
many
crimes
in
a
week
now
during
all
those
years
the
government
was
becoming
more
and
more
cruel
more
and
more
barbarous
and
we
do
not
find
and
we
have
not
found
that
the
church
of
england
with
its
or
ministers
with
its
more
than
a
score
of
bishops
in
the
house
of
lords
has
ever
raised
its
voice
or
perfected
any
organization
in
favor
of
a
more
merciful
code
or
in
condemnation
of
the
enormous
cruelty
which
the
laws
were
continually
inflicting
and
was
not
voltaire
justified
in
saying
that
the
english
were
a
people
who
murdered
by
law
now
that
is
an
extract
from
a
speech
made
by
john
bright
in
may
that
shows
what
the
church
of
england
did
two
hundred
and
offenses
in
england
punishable
with
death
and
no
minister
no
bishop
no
church
organization
raising
his
or
its
voice
against
the
monstrous
cruelty
and
why
even
then
it
was
better
than
the
law
of
jehovah
and
the
protestants
were
as
bad
as
the
catholics
you
remember
the
time
of
henry
iv
in
france
when
the
edict
of
nantes
was
issued
simply
to
give
the
protestants
the
right
to
worship
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
their
conscience
just
as
soon
as
that
edict
was
issued
the
protestants
themselves
in
the
cities
where
they
had
the
power
prevented
the
catholics
from
worshiping
their
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
their
conscience
and
it
was
on
account
of
the
refusal
of
those
protestants
to
allow
the
catholics
to
worship
god
as
they
desired
that
there
was
a
civil
war
lasting
for
seven
years
in
france
richelieu
came
into
authority
about
the
second
or
third
year
of
that
war
he
made
no
difference
between
protestants
and
catholics
and
it
was
owing
to
richelieu
that
the
thirty
years
war
terminated
it
was
owing
to
richelieu
that
the
peace
of
westphalia
was
made
in
although
i
believe
he
had
been
dead
a
year
before
that
time
but
it
was
owing
to
him
and
it
was
the
first
peace
ever
made
between
nations
on
a
secular
basis
with
everything
religious
left
out
and
it
was
the
last
great
religious
war
you
may
ask
me
what
i
want
well
in
the
first
place
i
want
to
get
theology
out
of
government
it
has
no
business
there
man
gets
his
authority
from
man
and
is
responsible
only
to
man
i
want
to
get
theology
out
of
politics
our
ancestors
in
retired
god
from
politics
because
of
the
jealousies
among
the
churches
and
the
result
has
been
splendid
for
mankind
i
want
to
get
theology
out
of
education
teach
the
children
what
somebody
knows
not
what
somebody
guesses
i
want
to
get
theology
out
of
morality
and
out
of
charity
do
give
for
god
sake
but
for
man
sake
i
want
you
to
know
another
thing
that
neither
protestants
nor
catholics
are
fit
to
govern
this
world
they
are
not
fit
to
govern
themselves
how
could
you
elect
a
minister
of
any
religion
president
of
the
united
states
could
you
elect
a
bishop
of
the
catholic
church
or
a
methodist
bishop
or
episcopal
minister
or
one
of
the
elders
no
and
why
we
are
afraid
of
the
ecclesiastic
spirit
we
are
afraid
to
trust
the
liberties
of
men
in
the
hands
of
people
who
acknowledge
that
they
are
bound
by
a
standard
different
from
that
of
the
welfare
of
mankind
the
history
of
italy
france
spain
portugal
cuba
and
brazil
all
show
that
slavery
existed
where
catholicism
was
a
power
i
would
suggest
an
education
that
would
rule
theology
out
of
the
government
and
teach
people
to
rely
more
on
themselves
and
less
on
providence
there
are
two
ways
of
living
the
broad
way
of
life
lived
for
others
and
the
narrow
theological
way
it
is
wise
to
so
live
that
death
can
be
serenely
faced
and
then
if
there
is
another
world
the
best
way
to
prepare
for
it
is
to
make
the
best
of
this
and
if
there
be
no
other
world
the
best
way
to
live
here
is
to
so
live
as
to
be
happy
and
make
everybody
else
happy
ingersoll
lecture
on
the
great
infidels
ladies
and
gentlemen
there
is
nothing
grander
in
this
world
than
to
rescue
from
the
leprosy
of
slander
a
great
and
splendid
name
there
is
nothing
nobler
than
to
benefit
our
benefactors
the
infidels
of
one
age
have
been
the
aureole
saints
of
the
next
the
destroyers
of
the
old
have
always
been
the
creators
of
the
new
the
old
passes
away
and
the
new
becomes
old
there
is
in
the
intellectual
world
as
in
the
material
decay
and
growth
and
even
by
the
sunken
grave
of
age
stand
youth
and
joy
the
history
of
progress
is
written
in
the
lives
of
infidels
political
rights
have
been
preserved
by
traitors
intellectual
rights
by
infidels
to
attack
the
kings
was
treason
to
dispute
the
priests
blasphemy
the
sword
and
cross
have
always
been
allies
they
defended
each
other
the
throne
and
altar
are
twins
vultures
born
of
the
same
egg
it
was
james
who
said
no
king
no
bishop
no
church
no
crown
no
tyrant
in
heaven
no
tyrant
on
earth
every
monarchy
that
has
disgraced
the
world
every
despotism
that
has
covered
the
cheeks
of
men
with
fear
has
been
copied
after
the
supposed
despotism
of
hell
the
king
owned
the
bodies
and
the
priest
owned
the
souls
one
lived
on
taxes
and
the
other
on
alms
one
was
a
robber
and
the
other
a
beggar
the
history
of
the
world
will
not
show
you
one
charitable
beggar
he
who
lives
on
charity
never
has
anything
to
give
away
the
robbers
and
beggars
controlled
not
only
this
world
but
the
next
the
king
made
laws
the
priest
made
creeds
with
bowed
backs
the
people
received
and
bore
the
burdens
of
the
one
and
with
the
open
mouth
of
wonder
the
creed
of
the
other
if
any
aspired
to
be
free
they
were
crushed
by
the
king
and
every
priest
was
a
hero
who
slaughtered
the
children
of
the
brave
the
king
ruled
by
force
the
priest
by
fear
and
by
the
bible
the
king
said
to
the
people
god
made
you
peasants
and
me
a
king
he
clothed
you
in
rags
and
housed
you
in
hovels
upon
me
he
put
robes
and
gave
me
a
palace
such
is
the
justice
of
god
the
priest
said
to
the
people
god
made
you
ignorant
and
vile
me
holy
and
wise
obey
me
or
god
will
punish
you
here
and
hereafter
such
is
the
mercy
of
god
infidels
are
the
intellectual
discoverers
infidels
have
sailed
the
unknown
sea
and
have
discovered
the
isles
and
continents
in
the
vast
realms
of
thought
what
would
the
world
have
been
had
infidels
never
existed
what
the
infidel
is
in
religion
the
inventor
is
in
mechanics
what
the
infidel
is
in
religion
the
man
willing
to
fight
the
hosts
of
tyranny
is
in
the
political
world
an
infidel
is
a
gentleman
who
has
discovered
a
fact
and
is
not
afraid
to
tell
about
it
there
has
been
for
many
thousands
of
years
an
idea
prevalent
that
in
some
way
you
can
prove
whether
the
theories
defended
or
advanced
by
a
man
are
right
or
wrong
by
showing
what
kind
of
a
man
he
was
what
kind
of
a
life
he
lived
and
what
manner
of
death
he
died
there
is
nothing
to
this
it
makes
no
difference
what
the
character
of
the
man
was
who
made
the
first
multiplication
table
it
is
absolutely
true
and
whenever
you
find
an
absolute
fact
it
makes
no
difference
who
discovered
it
the
golden
rule
would
have
been
just
as
good
if
it
had
first
been
whispered
by
the
devil
it
is
good
for
what
it
contains
not
because
a
certain
man
said
it
gold
is
just
as
good
in
the
hands
of
crime
as
in
the
hands
of
virtue
whatever
it
may
be
it
is
gold
a
statement
made
by
a
great
man
is
not
necessarily
true
a
man
entertains
certain
opinions
and
then
he
is
proscribed
because
he
refuses
to
change
his
mind
he
is
burned
to
ashes
and
in
the
midst
of
the
flames
he
cries
out
that
he
is
of
the
same
opinion
still
hundreds
then
say
that
he
has
sealed
his
testimony
with
his
blood
and
that
his
doctrines
must
be
true
all
the
martyrs
in
the
history
of
the
world
are
not
sufficient
to
establish
the
correctness
of
any
one
opinion
martyrdom
as
a
rule
establishes
the
sincerity
of
the
martyr
not
the
correctness
of
his
thought
things
are
true
or
false
independently
of
the
man
who
entertains
them
truth
can
not
be
affected
by
opinion
an
error
can
not
be
believed
sincerely
enough
to
make
it
the
truth
no
christian
will
admit
that
any
amount
of
heroism
displayed
by
a
mormon
is
sufficient
to
show
that
joseph
smith
was
an
inspired
prophet
all
the
courage
and
culture
all
the
poetry
and
art
of
ancient
greece
do
not
even
tend
to
establish
the
truth
of
any
myth
the
testimony
of
the
dying
concerning
some
other
world
or
in
regard
to
the
supernatural
can
not
be
any
better
than
that
of
the
living
in
the
early
days
of
christian
experience
an
intrepid
faith
was
regarded
as
a
testimony
in
favor
of
the
church
no
doubt
in
the
arms
of
death
many
a
one
went
back
and
died
in
the
lay
of
the
old
faith
after
awhile
christians
got
to
dying
and
clinging
to
their
faith
and
then
it
was
that
christians
began
to
say
no
man
can
die
serenely
without
clinging
to
the
cross
according
to
the
theologians
god
has
always
punished
the
dying
who
did
not
happen
to
believe
in
him
as
long
as
men
did
nothing
except
to
render
their
fellowmen
wretched
god
maintained
the
strictest
neutrality
but
when
some
honest
man
expressed
a
doubt
as
to
the
jewish
scriptures
or
prayed
to
the
wrong
god
or
to
the
right
god
by
the
wrong
man
then
the
real
god
leaped
like
a
wounded
tiger
upon
this
dying
man
and
from
his
body
tore
his
wretched
soul
there
is
no
recorded
instance
where
the
uplifted
hand
of
murder
has
been
paralyzed
or
the
innocent
have
been
shielded
by
god
thousands
of
crimes
are
committed
every
day
and
god
has
no
time
to
prevent
them
he
is
too
busy
numbering
hairs
and
matching
sparrows
he
is
listening
for
blasphemy
he
is
looking
for
persons
who
laugh
at
priests
he
is
examining
baptismal
registers
he
is
watching
professors
in
colleges
who
begin
to
doubt
the
geology
of
moses
or
the
astronomy
of
joshua
all
kinds
of
criminals
except
infidels
meet
death
with
reasonable
serenity
as
a
rule
there
is
nothing
in
the
death
of
a
pirate
to
cast
discredit
upon
his
profession
the
murderer
upon
the
scaffold
smilingly
exhorts
the
multitude
to
meet
him
in
heaven
the
emperor
constantine
who
lifted
christianity
into
power
murdered
his
wife
and
oldest
son
now
and
then
in
the
history
of
the
world
there
has
been
a
man
of
genius
a
man
of
intellectual
honesty
these
men
have
denounced
the
superstition
of
their
day
they
were
honest
enough
to
tell
their
thoughts
some
of
them
died
naturally
in
their
beds
but
it
would
not
do
for
the
church
to
admit
that
they
died
peaceably
that
would
show
that
religion
was
not
necessary
in
the
last
moments
the
first
grave
the
first
cathedral
the
first
corpse
was
the
first
priest
if
there
was
no
death
in
the
world
there
would
be
no
superstition
the
church
has
taken
great
pains
to
show
that
the
last
moments
of
all
infidels
have
been
infinitely
wretched
upon
this
point
catholics
and
protestants
have
always
stood
together
they
are
no
longer
men
they
become
hyenas
they
dig
open
graves
they
devour
the
dead
it
is
an
auto
da
fe
presided
over
by
god
and
his
angels
these
men
believed
in
the
accountability
of
men
in
the
practice
of
virtue
and
justice
they
believed
in
liberty
but
they
did
not
believe
in
the
inspiration
of
the
bible
that
was
their
crime
in
order
to
show
that
infidels
died
overwhelmed
with
remorse
and
fear
they
have
generally
selected
from
all
the
infidels
since
the
days
of
christ
until
now
five
men
the
emperor
julian
bruno
diderot
david
hume
and
thomas
paine
they
forget
that
christ
himself
was
not
a
christian
that
he
did
what
he
could
to
tear
down
the
religion
of
his
day
that
he
held
the
temple
in
contempt
i
like
him
because
he
held
the
old
jewish
religion
in
contempt
because
he
had
sense
enough
to
say
that
doctrine
was
not
true
in
vain
have
their
calumniators
been
called
upon
to
prove
their
statements
they
simply
charge
it
they
simply
relate
it
but
that
is
no
evidence
the
emperor
julian
did
what
he
could
to
prevent
christians
destroying
each
other
he
held
pomp
and
pride
in
contempt
in
battle
with
the
persians
he
was
mortally
wounded
feeling
that
he
had
but
a
short
time
to
live
he
spent
his
last
hours
in
discussing
with
his
friends
the
immortality
of
the
soul
he
declared
that
he
was
satisfied
with
his
conduct
and
that
he
had
no
remorse
to
express
for
any
act
he
had
ever
done
the
first
great
infidel
was
giordano
bruno
he
was
born
in
the
year
of
grace
he
was
a
dominican
friar
catholic
and
afterwards
he
changed
his
mind
the
reason
he
changed
was
because
he
had
a
mind
he
was
a
lover
of
nature
and
said
to
the
poor
hermits
in
their
caves
to
the
poor
monks
in
their
monasteries
to
the
poor
nuns
in
their
cells
come
out
in
the
glad
fields
come
and
breathe
the
fresh
free
air
come
and
enjoy
all
the
beauty
there
is
in
the
world
there
is
no
god
who
can
be
made
happier
by
you
being
miserable
there
is
no
god
who
delights
to
see
upon
the
human
face
the
tears
of
pain
of
grief
of
agony
come
out
and
enjoy
all
there
is
of
human
life
enjoy
progress
enjoy
thought
enjoy
being
somebody
and
belonging
to
yourself
he
revolted
at
the
idea
of
transubstantiation
he
revolted
at
the
idea
that
the
eternal
god
could
be
in
a
wafer
he
revolted
at
the
idea
that
you
could
make
the
trinity
out
of
dough
bake
god
in
an
oven
as
you
would
a
biscuit
i
should
think
he
would
have
revolted
the
idea
of
a
man
devouring
the
creator
of
the
universe
by
swallowing
a
piece
of
bread
and
yet
that
is
just
as
sensible
as
any
of
it
those
who
when
smitten
on
one
cheek
turn
the
other
threatened
to
kill
this
man
he
fled
from
his
native
land
and
was
a
vagabond
in
nearly
every
nation
of
europe
he
declared
that
he
fought
not
what
men
really
believed
but
what
they
pretended
to
believe
and
do
you
know
that
is
the
business
i
am
in
i
am
simply
saying
what
other
people
think
i
am
furnishing
clothes
for
their
children
i
am
putting
on
exhibition
their
offspring
and
they
like
to
hear
it
they
like
to
see
it
we
have
passed
midnight
in
the
history
of
the
world
bruno
was
driven
from
his
native
country
because
he
taught
the
rotation
of
the
earth
you
can
see
what
a
dangerous
man
he
must
have
been
in
a
well
regulated
monarchy
you
see
he
had
found
a
fact
and
a
fact
has
the
same
effect
upon
religion
that
dynamite
has
upon
a
russian
czar
a
fellow
with
a
new
fact
was
suspected
and
arrested
and
they
always
thought
they
could
destroy
it
by
burning
him
but
they
never
did
all
the
fires
of
martyrdom
never
destroyed
one
truth
all
the
churches
of
the
world
have
never
made
one
lie
true
germany
and
france
would
not
tolerate
bruno
according
to
the
christian
system
this
world
was
the
center
of
everything
the
stars
were
made
out
of
what
little
god
happened
to
have
left
when
he
got
the
world
done
god
lived
up
in
the
sky
and
they
said
this
earth
must
rest
upon
something
and
finally
science
passed
its
hand
clear
under
and
there
was
nothing
it
was
in
infinite
space
then
the
church
began
to
say
they
did
say
it
was
flat
not
so
awful
flat
it
was
kind
of
rounding
according
to
the
ancient
christians
god
lived
from
all
eternity
and
never
worked
but
six
days
in
his
whole
life
and
then
had
the
impudence
to
tell
us
to
be
industrious
i
heard
of
a
man
going
to
california
over
the
plains
and
there
was
a
clergyman
on
board
and
he
had
a
great
deal
to
say
and
finally
he
fell
in
conversation
with
the
and
the
latter
said
to
the
clergyman
do
you
believe
that
god
made
this
world
in
six
days
yes
i
do
they
were
then
going
along
the
humboldt
says
he
do
you
think
he
could
put
in
another
day
to
advantage
right
around
here
bruno
went
to
england
and
delivered
lectures
at
oxford
he
found
that
there
was
nothing
taught
there
but
superstition
and
so
called
oxford
the
wisdom
of
learning
then
they
told
him
they
did
want
him
any
more
he
went
back
to
italy
where
there
was
a
kind
of
fascination
that
threw
him
back
to
the
very
doors
of
the
inquisition
he
was
arrested
for
teaching
that
there
were
other
worlds
and
that
stars
are
suns
around
which
revolve
other
planets
he
was
in
prison
for
six
years
during
those
six
years
galileo
was
teaching
mathematics
six
years
in
a
dungeon
and
then
he
was
tried
denounced
by
the
inquisition
excommunicated
condemned
by
brute
force
pushed
upon
his
knees
while
he
received
the
benediction
of
the
church
and
on
the
of
february
in
the
year
of
our
lord
he
was
burned
at
the
stake
he
believed
that
the
world
is
animated
by
an
intelligent
soul
the
cause
of
force
but
not
of
matter
that
matter
and
force
have
existed
from
eternity
that
this
force
lives
in
all
things
even
in
such
as
appear
not
to
live
in
the
rock
as
much
as
in
the
man
that
matter
is
the
mother
of
forms
and
the
grace
of
forms
that
the
matter
and
force
together
constitute
god
he
was
a
pantheist
that
is
to
say
he
was
an
atheist
he
had
the
courage
to
die
for
what
he
believed
to
be
right
the
murder
of
bruno
will
never
in
my
judgment
be
completely
and
perfectly
revenged
until
from
the
city
of
rome
shall
be
swept
every
vestige
of
priests
and
pope
until
from
the
shapeless
ruins
of
peter
the
crumbled
vatican
and
the
fallen
cross
of
rome
rises
a
monument
sacred
to
the
philosopher
the
benefactor
and
the
martyr
bruno
voltaire
was
born
in
when
he
was
born
the
natural
was
about
the
only
thing
that
the
church
did
not
believe
in
monks
sold
amulets
and
the
priests
cured
in
the
name
of
the
church
the
worship
of
the
devil
was
actually
established
which
today
is
the
religion
of
china
they
say
god
is
good
he
wo
bother
you
joss
is
the
one
they
offer
him
gifts
and
try
and
soften
his
heart
so
in
the
middle
ages
the
poor
people
tried
to
see
if
they
could
not
get
a
short
cut
and
trade
directly
with
the
devil
instead
of
going
through
the
church
in
these
days
witnesses
were
with
instruments
of
torture
voltaire
did
more
for
human
liberty
than
any
other
man
who
ever
lived
or
died
he
appealed
to
the
common
sense
of
mankind
he
held
up
the
great
contradictions
of
the
sacred
scriptures
in
a
way
that
no
man
once
having
read
him
could
forget
for
one
i
thank
voltaire
for
the
liberty
i
am
enjoying
this
moment
how
small
a
man
a
priest
looked
when
he
pointed
his
finger
at
him
how
contemptible
a
king
toward
the
last
of
may
it
was
whispered
in
paris
that
voltaire
was
dying
he
expired
with
the
most
perfect
tranquility
there
have
been
constructed
most
shameless
lies
about
the
death
of
this
great
and
wonderful
man
compared
with
whom
all
his
calumniators
living
or
dead
were
but
dust
and
vermin
from
his
throne
at
the
foot
of
the
alps
he
pointed
the
finger
of
scorn
at
every
hypocrite
in
europe
he
was
the
pioneer
of
his
century
in
in
scotland
david
hume
was
born
scotch
presbyterianism
is
the
worst
form
of
religion
that
has
ever
been
produced
the
scotch
kirk
had
all
the
faults
of
the
church
of
rome
without
a
redeeming
feature
the
church
hated
music
despised
painting
abhorred
statuary
and
held
architecture
in
contempt
anything
touched
with
humanity
with
the
weakness
of
love
with
the
dimple
of
joy
was
detested
by
the
scotch
kirk
god
was
to
be
feared
god
was
infinitely
practical
no
nonsense
about
god
they
used
to
preach
four
times
a
day
they
preached
on
friday
before
the
sunday
upon
which
they
partook
of
the
sacrament
and
then
on
saturday
four
sermons
on
sunday
and
two
or
three
on
monday
to
sober
up
on
they
were
bigoted
and
heartless
one
case
will
illustrate
in
the
beginning
of
this
nineteenth
century
a
boy
seventeen
years
of
age
was
indicted
at
edinburgh
for
blasphemy
he
had
given
it
as
his
opinion
that
moses
had
learned
magic
in
egypt
and
had
fooled
the
jews
they
proved
that
on
two
or
three
occasions
when
he
was
real
cold
he
jocularly
remarked
that
he
wished
he
was
in
hell
so
that
he
could
warm
up
he
was
tried
convicted
and
sentenced
to
be
hanged
he
recanted
he
even
wrote
that
he
believed
the
whole
business
and
that
he
just
said
it
for
pure
devilment
it
made
no
difference
they
hung
him
and
his
bruised
and
bleeding
corpse
was
denied
to
his
own
mother
who
came
and
besought
them
to
let
her
take
her
boy
home
that
was
scotch
presbyterianism
if
the
devil
had
been
let
loose
in
scotland
he
would
have
improved
that
country
at
that
time
david
hume
was
one
of
the
few
scotchmen
who
was
not
owned
by
the
church
he
had
the
courage
to
examine
things
for
himself
and
to
give
his
conclusion
to
the
world
his
life
was
unstained
by
an
unjust
act
he
did
not
like
abraham
turn
a
woman
from
his
door
with
his
child
in
her
arms
he
did
not
like
king
david
murder
a
man
that
he
might
steal
his
wife
he
did
believe
in
scotch
presbyterianism
i
see
how
any
good
man
ever
did
just
think
of
going
to
the
day
of
judgment
if
there
is
one
and
standing
up
before
god
and
admitting
without
a
blush
that
you
have
lived
and
died
a
scotch
presbyterian
i
would
expect
the
next
sentence
would
be
depart
ye
cursed
in
everlasting
fire
hume
took
the
ground
that
a
miracle
could
not
be
used
as
evidence
until
you
had
proved
the
miracle
of
course
that
excited
the
church
why
because
they
could
not
prove
one
of
them
how
are
you
going
to
prove
a
miracle
who
saw
it
and
who
would
know
a
devil
if
he
did
see
him
hume
insisted
that
at
the
bottom
of
all
good
is
something
useful
that
after
all
human
happiness
was
the
great
object
end
and
aim
of
life
that
virtue
was
not
a
termagant
with
sunken
cheeks
and
frightful
eyes
but
was
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
world
and
would
strew
your
path
with
flowers
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
when
he
died
they
gave
an
account
of
how
he
had
suffered
they
knew
that
the
horrors
of
death
would
fall
upon
him
and
that
god
would
get
his
revenge
but
his
attending
physician
said
that
his
death
was
the
most
serene
and
most
perfectly
tranquil
of
any
he
had
ever
seen
adam
smith
said
he
was
as
near
perfect
as
the
frailty
incident
to
humanity
would
allow
human
being
to
be
the
next
is
benedict
spinoza
a
jew
born
at
amsterdam
in
he
studied
theology
and
asked
the
rabbis
too
many
questions
and
talked
too
much
about
what
he
called
reason
and
finally
he
was
excommunicated
from
the
synagogue
and
became
an
outcast
at
the
age
of
without
friends
cursed
anathematized
bearing
upon
his
forehead
the
mark
of
cain
he
undertook
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
universe
to
him
the
universe
was
one
the
infinite
embraced
the
all
that
all
was
god
he
was
right
the
universe
is
all
there
is
and
if
god
does
not
exist
in
the
universe
he
exists
nowhere
the
idea
of
putting
some
little
jewish
jehovah
outside
the
universe
as
if
to
say
that
from
an
eternity
of
idleness
he
woke
up
one
morning
and
thought
he
would
make
something
the
propositions
of
spinoza
are
as
luminous
as
the
stars
and
his
demonstrations
each
one
of
them
is
a
gibraltar
behind
which
logic
sits
laughing
at
all
the
sophistries
of
theological
thought
in
every
relation
of
life
he
was
just
true
gentle
patient
loving
affectionate
he
died
in
in
his
life
of
years
he
had
climbed
to
the
very
highest
alpine
of
human
thought
he
was
a
great
and
splendid
man
an
intellectual
hero
one
of
the
benefactors
one
of
the
titans
of
our
race
and
now
i
will
say
a
few
words
about
our
infidels
we
had
three
to
say
the
least
of
them
paine
franklin
and
jefferson
in
their
day
the
colonies
were
filled
with
superstition
and
the
puritans
with
the
spirit
of
persecution
law
savage
ignorant
and
malignant
had
been
passed
in
every
colony
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
intellectual
liberty
manly
freedom
was
unknown
the
toleration
act
of
maryland
tolerated
only
chickens
not
thinkers
not
investigators
it
tolerated
faith
not
brains
the
charity
of
roger
williams
was
not
extended
to
one
who
denied
the
bible
let
me
show
you
how
we
have
advanced
suppose
you
took
every
man
and
woman
out
of
the
penitentiary
in
new
england
and
shipped
them
to
a
new
country
where
man
before
had
never
trod
and
told
them
to
make
a
government
and
constitution
and
a
code
of
laws
for
themselves
i
say
tonight
that
they
would
make
a
better
constitution
and
a
better
code
of
laws
than
any
that
were
made
in
any
of
the
original
thirteen
colonies
of
the
united
states
not
that
they
are
better
men
not
that
they
are
more
honest
but
that
they
have
got
more
sense
they
have
been
touched
with
the
dawn
of
the
eternal
day
of
liberty
that
will
finally
come
to
this
world
they
would
have
more
respect
for
others
rights
than
they
had
at
that
time
but
the
churches
were
jealous
of
each
other
and
we
got
a
constitution
without
religion
in
it
from
the
mutual
jealousies
of
the
church
and
from
the
genius
of
men
like
paine
franklin
and
jefferson
we
are
indebted
to
them
for
a
constitution
without
a
god
in
it
they
knew
that
if
you
put
god
in
there
an
infinite
god
there
would
be
any
room
for
the
people
our
fathers
retired
jehovah
from
politics
our
fathers
under
the
directions
and
leadership
of
those
infidels
said
all
power
comes
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
george
washington
wanted
to
establish
a
church
by
law
in
virginia
thomas
jefferson
prevented
it
under
the
guaranty
of
liberty
of
conscience
which
was
given
our
legislation
has
improved
and
it
will
not
be
many
years
before
all
laws
touching
liberty
of
conscience
excepting
it
may
be
in
the
state
of
delaware
will
be
blotted
out
and
when
that
time
comes
we
or
our
children
may
thank
the
infidels
of
the
church
never
pretended
that
franklin
died
in
fear
franklin
wrote
no
books
against
the
bible
he
thought
it
useless
to
cast
the
pearls
of
thought
before
the
swine
of
his
generation
jefferson
was
a
statesman
he
was
the
author
of
the
declaration
of
independence
founder
of
a
university
father
of
a
political
body
president
of
the
united
states
a
statesman
and
a
philosopher
he
was
too
powerful
for
the
churches
of
his
day
paine
attacked
the
trinity
and
the
bible
both
he
had
done
these
things
openly
his
arguments
were
so
good
that
his
reputation
got
bad
i
want
you
to
recollect
tonight
that
he
was
the
first
man
who
wrote
these
words
the
united
states
of
america
i
want
you
to
know
tonight
that
he
was
the
first
man
who
suggested
the
federal
constitution
i
want
you
to
know
that
he
did
more
for
the
actual
separation
from
great
britain
than
any
man
that
ever
lived
i
want
you
to
know
that
he
did
as
much
for
liberty
with
his
pen
as
any
soldier
did
with
his
sword
i
want
you
to
know
that
during
the
revolution
his
crisis
was
the
pillar
of
fire
by
night
and
a
cloud
by
day
i
want
you
to
know
that
his
common
sense
was
the
one
star
in
the
horizon
of
despotism
i
want
you
to
know
that
he
did
as
much
as
any
living
man
to
give
our
free
flag
to
the
free
air
he
was
not
content
to
waste
all
his
energies
here
when
the
volcano
covered
europe
with
the
shreds
of
robes
and
the
broken
fragments
of
thrones
paine
went
to
france
he
was
elected
by
four
constituencies
he
had
the
courage
to
vote
against
the
death
of
louis
and
was
imprisoned
he
wrote
to
washington
the
president
and
asked
him
to
interfere
washington
threw
the
letter
in
the
wastebasket
of
forgetfulness
when
paine
was
finally
released
he
gave
his
opinion
of
george
washington
and
under
such
circumstances
i
say
a
man
can
be
pardoned
for
having
said
even
unjust
things
the
eighteenth
century
was
crowning
its
gray
hairs
with
the
wreaths
of
progress
and
thomas
paine
said
i
will
do
something
to
liberate
mankind
from
superstition
he
wrote
the
age
of
reason
for
his
good
he
wrote
it
too
soon
for
ours
not
a
day
too
quick
from
that
moment
he
was
a
despised
and
calumniated
man
when
he
came
back
to
this
country
he
could
not
safely
walk
the
streets
for
fear
of
being
mobbed
under
the
constitution
he
had
suggested
his
rights
were
not
safe
under
the
flag
that
he
had
helped
give
to
heaven
with
which
he
had
enriched
the
air
his
liberty
was
not
safe
is
it
not
a
disgrace
to
us
that
all
the
lies
that
have
been
told
about
him
and
will
be
told
about
him
are
a
perpetual
disgrace
i
tell
you
that
upon
the
grave
of
thomas
paine
the
churches
of
america
have
sacrificed
their
reputation
for
veracity
who
can
hate
a
man
with
a
creed
i
believe
in
one
god
and
no
more
and
i
hope
for
immortality
i
believe
in
the
equality
of
man
and
that
religious
duty
consists
in
doing
justice
in
doing
mercy
and
in
endeavoring
to
make
our
happy
it
is
necessary
to
the
happiness
of
man
that
he
be
faithful
to
himself
one
good
schoolmaster
is
worth
a
thousand
priests
man
has
no
property
in
man
and
the
key
of
heaven
is
in
the
keeping
of
no
saint
grand
splendid
brave
man
with
some
faults
with
many
virtues
the
world
is
better
because
he
lived
and
if
thomas
paine
had
not
lived
i
could
not
have
delivered
this
lecture
here
tonight
did
all
the
priests
of
rome
increase
the
mental
wealth
of
man
as
much
as
bruno
did
all
the
priests
of
france
do
as
great
a
work
for
the
civilization
of
this
world
as
diderot
and
voltaire
did
all
the
ministers
of
scotland
add
as
much
to
the
sum
of
human
knowledge
as
david
hume
have
all
the
clergymen
monks
friars
ministers
priests
bishops
cardinals
and
popes
from
the
day
of
pentecost
to
the
last
election
done
as
much
for
human
liberty
as
thomas
paine
what
would
the
world
be
now
if
infidels
had
never
been
infidels
have
been
the
flower
of
all
this
world
recollect
by
infidels
i
mean
every
man
who
has
made
an
intellectual
advance
by
orthodox
i
mean
a
gentleman
who
is
petrified
in
his
mind
whopping
around
intellectually
simply
to
save
the
funeral
expenses
of
his
soul
infidels
are
the
creditors
of
all
the
years
to
come
they
have
made
this
world
fit
to
live
in
and
without
them
the
human
brain
would
be
as
empty
as
the
chronicles
soon
will
be
unless
they
preach
something
that
the
people
want
to
hear
it
is
not
a
crime
to
benefit
our
intellectually
the
churches
point
to
their
decayed
saints
and
their
crumbled
popes
and
say
do
you
know
more
than
all
the
ministers
that
ever
lived
and
without
the
slightest
egotism
or
blush
i
say
yes
and
the
name
of
humboldt
outweighs
them
all
the
men
who
stand
in
the
front
rank
the
men
who
know
most
of
the
secrets
of
nature
the
men
who
know
most
are
today
the
advanced
infidels
of
this
world
i
have
lived
long
enough
to
see
the
brand
of
intellectual
inferiority
on
every
orthodox
brain
ingersoll
lecture
on
talmagian
theology
ladies
and
gentlemen
nothing
can
be
more
certain
than
that
no
human
being
can
by
any
possibility
control
his
thought
we
are
in
this
world
we
see
we
hear
we
feel
we
taste
and
everything
in
nature
makes
an
impression
upon
the
brain
and
that
wonderful
something
enthroned
there
with
these
materials
weaves
what
we
call
thought
and
the
brain
can
no
more
help
thinking
than
the
heart
can
help
beating
the
blood
pursues
its
old
accustomed
round
without
our
will
the
heart
beats
without
asking
leave
of
us
and
the
brain
thinks
in
spite
of
all
that
we
can
do
this
being
true
no
human
being
can
justly
be
held
responsible
for
his
thought
any
more
than
for
the
beating
of
his
heart
any
more
than
for
the
course
pursued
by
the
blood
any
more
than
for
breathing
air
and
yet
for
thousands
of
years
thought
has
been
thought
to
be
a
crime
and
thousands
and
millions
have
threatened
us
with
eternal
fire
if
we
give
the
product
of
that
brain
each
brain
in
my
judgment
is
a
field
where
nature
sows
the
seeds
of
thought
and
thought
is
the
crop
that
man
reaps
and
it
certainly
can
not
be
a
crime
to
gather
it
certainly
can
not
be
a
crime
to
tell
it
which
simply
amounts
to
the
right
to
sell
your
crop
or
to
exchange
your
product
for
the
product
of
some
other
man
brain
that
is
all
it
is
most
brains
at
least
some
are
rather
poor
fields
and
the
orthodox
worst
of
all
that
field
produces
mostly
sorrel
and
mullin
while
there
are
fields
which
like
the
tropic
world
are
filled
with
growth
and
where
you
find
the
vine
and
palm
royal
children
of
the
sun
and
brain
i
then
stand
simply
for
absolute
freedom
of
thought
absolute
and
i
do
believe
if
there
be
a
god
that
it
will
be
or
can
be
pleasing
to
him
to
see
one
of
his
children
afraid
to
express
what
he
thinks
and
if
i
were
god
i
never
would
cease
making
men
until
i
succeeded
in
making
one
grand
enough
to
tell
his
honest
opinion
now
there
has
been
a
struggle
you
know
a
long
time
between
the
believers
in
the
natural
and
the
supernatural
between
gentlemen
who
are
going
to
reward
us
in
another
world
and
those
who
propose
to
make
life
worth
living
here
and
now
in
all
ages
the
priest
the
medicine
man
the
magician
the
astrologer
in
other
words
gentlemen
who
have
traded
upon
the
fear
and
ignorance
of
their
in
all
countries
they
have
sought
to
make
their
living
out
of
others
there
was
a
time
when
a
god
presided
over
every
department
of
human
interest
when
a
man
about
to
take
a
voyage
bribed
the
priest
of
neptune
so
that
he
might
have
a
safe
journey
and
when
he
came
back
he
paid
more
telling
the
priest
that
he
was
infinitely
obliged
to
him
that
he
had
kept
waves
from
the
sea
and
storms
in
their
caves
and
so
when
one
was
sick
he
went
to
a
priest
when
one
was
about
to
take
a
journey
he
visited
the
priest
of
mercury
if
he
were
going
to
war
he
consulted
the
representative
of
mars
we
have
gone
along
when
the
poor
agriculturist
plowed
his
ground
and
put
in
the
seed
he
went
to
the
priest
of
some
god
and
paid
him
to
keep
off
the
frost
and
the
priest
said
he
would
do
it
but
added
the
priest
you
must
have
faith
if
the
frost
came
early
he
said
you
did
have
faith
and
besides
all
that
he
says
to
him
anything
that
has
happened
badly
after
all
was
for
your
good
well
we
found
out
day
by
day
that
a
good
boat
for
the
purpose
of
navigating
the
sea
was
better
than
prayers
better
than
the
influence
of
priests
and
you
had
better
have
a
good
captain
attending
to
business
than
thousands
of
priests
ashore
praying
we
also
found
that
we
could
cure
some
diseases
and
just
as
soon
as
we
found
that
we
could
cure
diseases
we
dismissed
the
priest
we
have
left
him
out
now
of
all
of
them
except
it
may
be
cholera
and
smallpox
when
visited
by
a
plague
some
people
get
frightened
enough
to
go
back
to
the
old
idea
go
back
to
the
priest
and
the
priest
says
it
has
been
sent
as
a
punishment
well
sensible
people
began
to
look
about
they
saw
that
the
good
died
as
readily
as
the
bad
they
saw
that
this
disease
would
attack
the
dimpled
child
in
the
cradle
and
allow
the
murderer
to
go
unpunished
and
so
they
began
to
think
in
time
that
it
was
not
sent
as
a
punishment
that
it
was
a
natural
result
and
so
the
priest
stepped
out
of
medicine
in
agriculture
we
need
him
no
longer
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
crops
all
the
clergymen
in
this
world
can
never
get
one
drop
of
rain
out
of
the
sky
and
all
the
clergymen
in
the
civilized
world
could
not
save
one
human
life
if
they
tried
it
oh
but
they
say
we
do
not
expect
a
direct
answer
to
prayer
it
is
the
reflex
action
we
are
after
it
is
like
a
man
endeavoring
to
lift
himself
up
by
the
straps
of
his
boots
he
will
never
do
it
but
he
will
get
a
great
deal
of
useful
exercise
the
missionary
goes
to
some
pagan
land
and
there
he
finds
a
man
praying
to
a
god
of
stone
and
it
excites
the
wrath
of
the
missionary
i
ask
you
tonight
does
not
that
stone
god
answer
prayer
just
as
well
as
ours
does
he
not
cause
rain
does
he
not
delay
frost
does
he
not
snatch
the
ones
that
we
love
from
the
grasp
of
death
precisely
the
same
as
ours
yet
we
have
ministers
that
are
still
engaged
in
that
business
they
tell
us
that
they
have
been
called
that
they
do
not
go
at
their
profession
as
other
people
do
but
they
are
called
that
god
looking
over
the
world
carefully
selects
his
priests
his
ministers
and
his
exhorters
i
do
know
they
say
their
calling
is
sacred
i
say
to
you
tonight
that
every
kind
of
business
that
is
honest
that
a
man
engages
in
for
the
purpose
of
feeding
his
wife
and
children
for
the
purpose
of
building
up
his
home
for
the
purpose
of
feeding
and
clothing
the
ones
he
loves
that
business
is
sacred
they
tell
us
that
statesmen
and
poets
philosophers
heroes
and
scientists
and
inventors
come
by
chance
that
all
other
departments
depend
entirely
upon
luck
but
when
god
wants
exhorters
he
selects
they
also
tell
us
that
it
is
infinitely
wicked
to
attack
the
christian
religion
and
when
i
speak
of
the
christian
religion
i
do
not
refer
especially
to
the
christianity
of
the
new
testament
i
refer
to
the
christianity
of
the
orthodox
church
and
when
i
refer
to
the
clergy
i
refer
to
the
clergy
of
the
orthodox
church
there
was
a
time
when
men
of
genius
were
in
the
pulpits
of
the
orthodox
church
that
time
is
past
when
you
find
a
man
with
brains
now
occupying
an
orthodox
pulpit
you
will
find
him
touched
with
heresy
every
one
of
them
how
do
they
get
most
of
these
ministers
there
will
be
a
man
in
the
neighborhood
not
very
well
not
having
constitution
enough
to
be
wicked
and
it
instantly
suggests
itself
to
everybody
who
sees
him
that
he
would
make
an
excellent
minister
there
are
so
many
other
professions
so
many
cities
to
be
built
so
many
railways
to
be
constructed
so
many
poems
to
be
sung
so
much
music
to
be
composed
so
many
papers
to
edit
so
many
books
to
read
so
many
splendid
things
so
many
avenues
to
distinction
and
glory
so
many
things
beckoning
from
the
horizon
of
the
future
to
every
great
and
splendid
man
that
the
pulpit
has
to
put
up
with
the
leavings
ravelings
selvage
these
preachers
say
how
can
any
man
be
wicked
and
infamous
enough
to
attack
our
religion
and
take
from
the
world
the
solace
of
orthodox
christianity
what
is
that
solace
let
us
be
honest
what
is
it
if
the
christian
religion
be
true
the

greatest
noblest
of

died
in

country
a
philosopher
ralph
waldo
emerson
a
man
of
the
loftiest
ideal
a
perfect
model
of
integrity
whose
mind
was
like
a
placid

and
reflected
truths
like
stars
if
the

be

tender
as
the
dawn
have
gone
into

of
homes
not
an
impure
not

in

all
but
he
was
not
a
christian
he
did
not
believe
in
the
tidings
of
great
joy
he
did
believe
that
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
intended
to
damn
most
everybody
and
now
he
has
gone
to
his
reward

charles

threw
more

than

have
traversed

on

had
it
been
possible
to
have

corrected

error
that
he

no

by

i

not
do
i
can

express
to
you

my
contempt
for

these
are
the
men
who
are

and
who
else
those
who
never
had
brain
enough
to
harbor
a
doubt
and
they
ask
me
how
can
you
be
wicked
enough
to
attack
the
christian
religion
oh
but
they
say
god
will
never
forgive
you
if
you
attack
the
orthodox
religion
now
when
i
read
the
history
of
this
world
and
when
i
think
of
the
experience
of
my
when
i
think
of
the
millions
living
in
poverty
and
when
i
know
that
in
the
very
air
we
breathe
and
in
the
sunlight
that
visits
our
homes
there
lurks
an
assassin
ready
to
take
our
lives
and
even
when
we
believe
we
are
in
the
fullness
health
and
joy
they
are
undermining
us
with
their
contagion
when
i
know
that
we
are
surrounded
by
all
these
evils
and
when
i
think
of
what
man
has
suffered
i
do
not
wonder
if
god
can
forgive
man
but
i
often
ask
myself
can
man
forgive
god
there
is
another
thing
some
of
these
ministers
have
talked
about
me
and
have
made
it
their
business
to
say
unpleasant
things
among
others
the
rev
talmage
of
brooklyn
a
man
of
not
much
imagination
but
of
most
excellent
judgment
charges
that
i
am
a
blasphemer
a
frightful
charge
terrible
if
true
what
is
blasphemy
it
is
a
sin
as
i
understand
against
god
is
god
infinite
he
is
so
they
say
he
is
infinite
absolutely
conditionless
can
i
injure
the
conditionless
no
can
i
sin
against
anything
that
i
can
not
injure
no
that
is
a
perfectly
plain
proposition
i
can
injure
my
because
he
is
a
conditioned
being
and
i
can
help
to
change
those
conditions
he
must
have
air
he
must
have
food
he
must
have
clothing
he
must
have
shelter
but
god
is
conditionless
and
i
can
not
by
any
possibility
affect
him
consequently
i
can
not
sin
against
him
but
i
can
sin
against
my
so
that
i
ought
to
be
a
thousand
times
more
careful
of
doing
injustice
than
of
uttering
blasphemy
there
is
no
blasphemy
but
injustice
and
there
is
no
worship
except
the
practice
of
justice
it
is
a
thousand
times
more
important
that
we
should
love
our
than
that
we
should
love
god
it
is
better
to
love
wife
and
children
than
to
love
jesus
christ
he
is
dead
they
are
alive
i
can
make
their
lives
happy
and
fill
all
their
hours
with
the
fullness
of
joy
that
is
my
religion
and
the
holiest
temple
ever
erected
beneath
the
stars
is
the
home
the
holiest
altar
is
the
fireside
what
is
this
blasphemy
first
it
is
a
geographical
question
there
was
a
time
when
it
was
blasphemy
in
jerusalem
to
say
that
christ
was
god
in
this
country
it
is
now
blasphemy
to
say
that
he
was
not
it
is
blasphemy
in
constantinople
to
deny
that
mahomet
was
the
prophet
of
god
it
is
blasphemy
here
to
say
that
he
was
it
is
a
geographical
question
you
can
not
tell
whether
it
is
blasphemy
or
not
without
looking
at
the
map
what
is
blasphemy
it
is
what
the
mistake
says
about
the
fact
it
is
what
the
last
year
leaf
says
about
this
bud
it
is
the
last
cry
of
the
defeated
priest
blasphemy
is
the
little
behind
which
hypocrisy
hides
behind
which
mental
impotency
feels
safe
there
is
no
blasphemy
but
the
avowal
of
thought
and
he
who
speaks
what
he
thinks
blasphemes
that
i
have
had
the
hardihood
it
does
take
much
to
attack
the
sacred
scriptures
i
have
simply
given
my
opinion
and
yet
they
tell
me
that
that
book
is
holy
that
you
can
take
rags
make
pulp
put
ink
on
it
bind
it
in
leather
and
make
something
holy
the
catholics
have
a
man
for
a
pope
the
protestants
have
a
book
the
catholics
have
the
best
of
it
if
they
elect
an
idiot
he
will
not
live
forever
and
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
get
rid
of
the
barbarisms
in
our
book
the
catholics
said
we
will
not
let
the
common
people
read
the
bible
that
was
right
if
it
is
necessary
to
believe
it
in
order
to
get
to
heaven
no
man
should
run
the
risk
of
reading
it
to
allow
a
man
to
read
the
bible
on
such
conditions
is
to
set
a
trap
for
his
soul
the
right
way
is
never
to
open
it
and
when
you
get
to
the
day
of
judgment
and
they
ask
you
if
you
believe
it
say
yes
i
have
never
read
it
the
protestant
gives
the
book
to
a
poor
man
and
says
read
it
you
are
at
liberty
to
read
it
well
suppose
i
do
believe
it
when
i
get
through
then
you
will
be
damned
no
man
should
be
allowed
to
read
it
on
those
conditions
and
yet
protestants
have
done
that
infinitely
cruel
thing
if
i
thought
it
was
necessary
to
believe
it
i
would
say
never
read
another
line
in
it
but
just
believe
it
and
stick
to
it
and
yet
these
people
really
think
that
there
is
something
miraculous
about
the
book
they
regard
it
as
a
fetish
a
kind
of
amulet
a
something
charmed
that
will
keep
off
evil
spirits
or
bad
luck
stop
bullets
and
do
a
thousand
for
the
preservation
of
life
i
heard
a
story
upon
that
subject
you
know
that
thousands
of
them
are
printed
in
the
books
here
is
one
they
do
print
there
was
a
poor
man
who
had
belonged
to
the
church
but
he
got
cold
and
he
rather
neglected
it
and
he
had
bad
luck
in
his
business
and
he
went
down
and
down
and
down
until
he
had
a
dollar
not
a
thing
to
eat
and
his
wife
said
to
him
john
this
comes
of
you
having
abandoned
the
church
this
comes
of
your
having
done
away
with
family
worship
now
i
beg
of
you
let
go
back
well
john
said
it
would
do
any
harm
to
try
so
he
took
down
the
bible
blew
the
dust
off
it
read
a
little
from
a
chapter
and
had
family
worship
as
he
was
putting
it
up
he
opened
it
again
and
there
was
a
bill
between
the
leaves
he
rushed
out
to
the
butcher
and
bought
meat
to
the
grocer
and
bought
tea
and
bread
and
butter
and
eggs
and
rushed
back
home
and
got
them
cooked
and
the
house
was
filled
with
the
perfume
of
food
and
he
sat
down
at
the
table
tears
in
every
eye
and
a
smile
on
every
face
she
said
what
did
i
tell
you
just
then
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
and
in
came
a
constable
who
arrested
him
for
passing
a
counterfeit
bill
they
tell
me
that
i
ought
not
to
attack
the
bible
that
i
have
misrepresented
it
and
among
other
things
that
i
have
said
that
according
to
the
bible
the
world
was
made
of
nothing
well
what
was
it
made
of
they
say
god
created
everything
consequently
there
must
have
been
nothing
when
he
commenced
if
he
did
make
it
of
nothing
what
did
he
make
it
of
where
there
was
nothing
he
made
something
yes
out
of
what
i
do
know
this
doctor
of
divinity
and
i
should
think
such
a
divinity
would
need
a
doctor
says
that
god
made
the
universe
out
of
his
omnipotence
why
not
out
of
his
omniscience
or
his
omnipresence
omnipotence
is
not
a
raw
material
it
is
the
something
to
work
raw
material
with
omnipotence
is
simply
all
powerful
and
what
good
would
strength
do
with
nothing
the
weakest
man
ever
born
could
lift
as
much
nothing
as
god
and
he
could
do
as
much
with
it
after
he
got
it
lifted
and
yet
a
doctor
of
divinity
tells
me
that
this
world
was
made
of
omnipotence
and
right
here
let
me
say
i
find
even
in
the
mind
of
the
clergymen
the
seeds
of
infidelity
he
is
trying
to
explain
things
that
is
a
bad
symptom
the
greater
the
miracle
the
greater
the
reward
for
believing
it
god
can
not
afford
to
reward
a
man
for
believing
anything
reasonable
why
even
the
scribes
and
pharisees
would
believe
a
reasonable
thing
do
you
suppose
god
is
to
crown
you
with
eternal
joy
and
give
you
a
musical
instrument
for
believing
something
where
the
evidence
is
clear
no
sir
the
larger
the
miracle
the
more
grace
and
let
me
advise
the
ministers
of
chicago
and
of
this
country
never
to
explain
a
miracle
it
can
not
be
explained
if
you
succeed
in
explaining
it
the
miracle
is
gone
if
you
fail
you
are
gone
my
advice
to
the
clergy
is
use
assertion
just
say
it
is
so
and
the
larger
the
miracle
the
greater
the
glory
reaped
by
the
eternal
and
yet
this
man
is
trying
to
explain
pretending
that
he
had
some
raw
material
of
some
kind
on
hand
and
then
i
objected
to
the
fact
that
he
did
make
the
sun
until
the
fourth
day
and
that
consequently
the
grass
could
not
have
grown
could
not
have
thrown
its
mantle
of
green
over
the
shoulders
of
the
hill
and
that
the
trees
would
not
blossom
and
cast
their
shade
upon
the
sod
without
some
sunshine
and
what
does
this
man
say
why
that
the
rocks
when
they
crystallized
emitted
light
even
enough
to
raise
a
crop
by
and
he
says
vegetation
might
have
depended
on
the
glare
of
volcanoes
in
the
moon
what
do
you
think
would
be
the
fate
of
agriculture
depending
on
the
glare
of
volcanoes
in
the
moon
then
he
says
the
aurora
borealis
why
you
could
raise
cucumbers
by
the
aurora
borealis
and
he
says
liquid
rivers
of
molten
granite
i
would
like
to
have
a
farm
on
that
stream
he
guesses
everything
of
the
kind
except
and
foxfire
now
think
of
that
explanation
in
the
last
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
by
a
minister
the
truth
is
the
gentleman
who
wrote
the
account
knew
nothing
of
astronomy
knew
as
little
as
the
modern
preacher
does
just
about
the
same
and
if
they
do
know
more
about
the
next
world
than
they
do
about
this
it
is
hardly
worth
while
talking
with
them
on
the
subject
there
was
a
time
you
know
when
the
minister
was
the
educated
man
in
the
country
and
when
if
you
wanted
to
know
anything
you
asked
him
now
you
do
if
you
do
so
i
find
this
man
expounding
the
flood
and
he
says
it
was
not
very
wet
he
begins
to
doubt
whether
god
had
water
enough
to
cover
the
whole
earth
why
not
stand
by
his
book
he
says
that
some
of
the
animals
got
into
the
ark
to
keep
out
of
the
wet
i
believe
that
is
the
way
the
democrats
got
to
the
polls
last
tuesday
another
divine
says
that
god
would
have
drowned
them
all
but
it
was
purely
for
the
sake
of
economy
that
he
saved
any
of
them
just
think
of
that
according
to
this
christian
religion
all
the
people
in
the
world
were
totally
depraved
through
the
fall
and
god
found
he
could
not
do
anything
with
them
so
he
drowned
them
now
if
god
wanted
to
get
up
a
flood
big
enough
to
drown
sin
why
did
he
not
get
up
a
flood
big
enough
to
drown
the
snake
that
was
his
mistake
now
these
people
say
that
if
jonah
had
walked
rapidly
up
and
down
the
belly
he
would
have
avoided
the
action
of
its
imagine
jonah
sitting
in
the
whale
mouth
on
the
back
of
a
and
yet
this
doctor
of
divinity
would
have
us
believe
that
the
infinite
god
of
the
universe
was
sitting
under
his
gourd
and
made
the
worm
that
was
at
the
root
of
jonah
vine
great
business
david
is
said
to
have
been
a
man
after
god
own
heart
and
if
you
will
read
the
chapter
of
chronicles
you
will
find
that
david
died
full
of
years
and
honors
so
i
find
in
the
great
book
of
prophecy
concerning
solomon
he
shall
reign
in
peace
and
quietness
he
shall
be
my
son
and
i
shall
be
his
father
and
i
will
preserve
his
kingdom
was
that
true
it
wo
do
but
they
say
god
could
do
away
with
slavery
suddenly
nor
with
polygamy
all
at
once
that
he
had
to
do
it
gradually
that
if
he
had
told
this
man
you
must
have
slaves
and
one
man
that
he
must
have
one
wife
and
one
wife
that
she
must
have
one
husband
he
would
have
lost
the
control
over
them
notwithstanding
all
the
miraculous
power
is
it
not
wonderful
that
when
they
did
all
these
miracles
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
them
is
it
wonderful
that
in
egypt
when
they
performed
these
wonders
when
the
waters
were
turned
into
blood
when
the
people
were
smitten
with
disease
and
covered
with
the
horrible
animals
is
it
wonderful
that
it
had
no
influence
on
them
do
you
know
why
all
these
miracles
did
affect
the
egyptians
they
were
there
at
the
time
is
it
wonderful
too
that
the
jews
who
had
been
brought
from
bondage
had
followed
a
cloud
by
day
and
a
pillar
of
fire
by
night
who
had
been
miraculously
fed
and
for
whose
benefit
water
had
leaked
from
the
rocks
and
followed
them
up
and
down
hill
through
all
their
journeying
is
it
wonderful
when
they
had
seen
the
earth
open
and
their
companions
swallowed
when
they
had
seen
god
himself
write
in
robes
of
flames
from
sinai
crags
when
they
had
seen
him
talking
face
to
face
with
moses
is
it
a
little
wonderful
that
he
had
no
more
influence
over
them
they
were
there
at
the
time
and
that
is
the
reason
they
did
mind
it
they
were
there
and
yet
with
all
these
miracles
this
god
could
not
prevent
polygamy
and
slavery
was
there
no
room
on
the
two
tables
of
stone
to
put
two
more
commandments
better
have
written
them
on
the
back
then
better
have
left
the
others
all
off
and
put
these
two
on
man
shall
not
enslave
his
brother
you
shall
not
live
on
unpaid
labor
and
the
one
man
shall
have
the
one
wife
if
these
two
had
been
written
and
the
other
ten
left
off
it
would
have
been
a
thousand
times
better
for
this
world
but
they
say
god
works
gradually
no
hurry
about
it
he
is
not
gradual
about
keeping
sunday
because
if
he
met
a
man
picking
up
sticks
he
killed
him
but
in
other
things
he
is
gradual
suppose
we
wanted
now
to
break
certain
cannibals
of
eating
missionaries
wanted
to
stop
them
from
eating
them
raw
of
course
we
would
not
tell
them
in
the
first
place
it
was
wrong
that
would
not
do
we
would
induce
them
to
cook
them
that
would
be
the
first
step
toward
civilization
we
would
have
them
stew
them
we
would
not
say
it
is
wrong
to
eat
missionary
but
it
is
wrong
to
eat
missionary
raw
then
after
they
began
stewing
them
we
would
put
in
a
little
mutton
not
enough
to
excite
suspicion
but
just
a
little
and
so
day
by
day
we
would
put
in
a
little
more
mutton
and
a
little
less
missionary
until
in
about
what
the
bible
calls
the
fullness
of
time
we
would
have
clear
mutton
and
no
missionary
that
is
god
way
the
next
great
charge
against
me
is
that
i
have
disgraced
my
parents
by
expressing
my
honest
thoughts
no
man
can
disgrace
his
parents
that
way
i
want
my
children
to
express
their
real
opinions
whether
they
agree
with
mine
or
not
i
want
my
children
to
find
out
more
than
i
have
found
and
i
would
be
gratified
to
have
them
discover
the
errors
i
have
made
and
if
my
father
and
mother
were
still
alive
i
feel
and
know
that
i
am
pursuing
a
course
of
which
they
would
approve
i
am
true
to
my
manhood
but
think
of
it
suppose
the
father
of
talmage
had
been
a
methodist
and
his
mother
an
infidel
then
what
would
he
have
to
disgrace
them
both
to
be
a
presbyterian
the
disciples
of
christ
according
to
this
doctrine
disgraced
their
parents
the
founder
of
every
new
religion
according
to
this
doctrine
was
a
disgrace
to
his
father
and
mother
now
there
must
have
been
a
time
when
a
talmage
was
not
a
presbyterian
and
the
one
that
left
something
else
to
join
that
church
disgraced
his
father
and
mother
why
if
this
doctrine
be
true
why
do
you
send
missionaries
to
other
lands
and
ask
those
people
to
disgrace
their
parents
if
this
doctrine
be
true
nobody
has
religious
liberty
except
foundlings
and
it
should
be
written
over
every
foundling
hospital
home
for
religious
liberty
it
wo
do
what
is
the
next
thing
i
have
said
i
have
taken
the
ground
and
i
take
it
again
today
that
the
bible
has
only
words
of
humiliation
for
woman
the
bible
treats
woman
as
the
slave
the
serf
of
man
and
wherever
that
book
is
believed
in
thoroughly
woman
is
a
slave
it
is
the
infidelity
in
the
church
that
gives
her
what
liberty
she
has
today
oh
but
says
the
gentleman
think
of
the
heroines
in
the
bible
how
could
a
book
be
opposed
to
woman
which
has
pictured
such
heroines
well
that
is
a
good
argument
let
answer
it
who
are
the
heroines
he
tells
us
the
first
is
esther
who
was
she
esther
is
a
very
peculiar
book
and
the
story
is
about
this
ahasaerus
was
a
king
his
wife
name
was
vashti
she
did
please
him
he
divorced
her
and
advertised
for
another
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
mordecai
had
a
good
looking
niece
and
he
took
her
to
market
her
name
was
esther
i
do
feel
like
reading
the
whole
of
the
second
chapter
it
is
sufficient
to
say
she
was
selected
after
a
time
there
was
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
haman
who
i
should
think
was
in
the
cabinet
according
to
the
story
and
this
man
mordecai
began
to
put
on
considerable
style
because
his
niece
was
the
king
wife
and
he
would
not
bow
or
he
would
not
rise
or
he
would
not
meet
this
gentleman
with
marks
of
distinguished
consideration
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
have
him
hung
then
they
got
out
an
order
to
kill
the
jews
and
this
esther
went
to
see
the
king
in
those
days
they
believed
in
the
bismarkian
style
of
government
all
power
came
from
the
king
not
from
the
people
if
anybody
went
to
see
this
king
without
an
invitation
and
he
failed
to
hold
out
his
sceptre
to
him
the
person
was
killed
just
to
preserve
the
dignity
of
the
monarch
when
esther
arrived
he
held
out
the
sceptre
and
she
induced
him
to
send
out
another
order
for
the
fellows
who
were
to
kill
the
jews
and
they
killed
or
of
them
and
they
came
back
and
said
kill
haman
and
his
ten
sons
and
they
hung
the
family
up
that
is
all
there
is
to
the
story
and
yet
this
esther
is
held
up
as
a
model
of
womanly
grace
and
tenderness
and
there
is
not
a
more
infamous
story
in
the
literature
of
the
world
the
next
heroine
is
ruth
i
admit
that
is
a
very
pretty
story
but
ruth
was
guilty
of
more
things
that
would
be
deemed
indiscreet
than
any
girl
in
brooklyn
that
is
all
there
is
about
ruth
the
next
heroine
is
hannah
and
what
do
you
suppose
was
the
matter
with
her
she
made
a
coat
for
her
boy
that
all
i
have
known
a
woman
make
a
whole
suit
the
next
heroine
was
abigail
she
was
the
wife
of
natal
king
david
had
a
few
soldiers
with
him
and
he
called
at
the
house
of
natal
and
asked
if
he
could
not
get
food
for
his
men
abigail
went
down
to
give
him
something
to
eat
and
she
was
very
much
struck
with
david
david
evidently
fancied
her
natal
died
within
a
week
i
think
he
was
poisoned
david
and
abigail
were
married
if
that
had
happened
in
chicago
there
would
have
been
a
coroner
jury
and
an
inquest
but
that
is
all
there
was
to
that
the
next
is
dorcas
she
was
in
the
new
testament
she
was
real
good
to
the
ministers
those
ladies
have
always
stood
well
with
the
church
she
was
real
good
to
the
poor
she
died
one
day
and
you
never
hear
of
her
again
then
there
was
that
person
that
was
raised
from
the
dead
i
would
like
to
know
from
a
person
that
had
recently
been
raised
from
the
dead
where
he
was
when
he
was
wanted
what
he
was
traveling
about
and
what
he
was
engaged
in
i
can
not
imagine
a
more
interesting
person
than
one
that
has
just
been
raised
from
the
dead
lazarus
comes
from
the
tomb
and
i
think
sometimes
that
there
must
be
a
mistake
about
it
because
when
they
come
to
die
again
thousands
of
people
would
say
why
he
knows
all
about
it
would
it
not
be
noted
if
a
man
had
two
funerals
now
then
these
are
all
the
heroines
to
show
you
how
little
they
thought
of
woman
in
that
day
in
the
days
of
the
old
testament
they
did
not
even
tell
us
when
the
mother
of
us
all
eve
died
nor
where
she
is
buried
nor
anything
about
it
they
do
not
even
tell
us
where
the
mother
of
christ
sleeps
nor
when
she
died
never
is
she
spoken
of
after
the
morning
of
the
resurrection
he
who
descended
from
the
cross
went
not
to
see
her
and
the
son
had
no
word
for
the
mother
the
story
is
not
true
i
believe
christ
was
a
great
and
good
man
but
he
had
nothing
about
him
miraculous
except
the
courage
to
tell
what
he
thought
about
the
religion
of
his
day
the
new
testament
in
relating
what
occurred
between
christ
and
his
mother
mentions
three
instances
once
when
they
thought
he
had
been
lost
in
jerusalem
when
he
said
to
them
wist
ye
not
that
i
must
be
about
my
father
business
next
at
the
marriage
of
cana
when
he
said
to
the
woman
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
words
which
he
never
said
and
again
from
the
cross
mother
behold
thy
son
and
to
the
disciple
behold
thy
mother
so
of
mary
magdalene
in
some
respects
there
is
no
character
in
the
new
testament
that
so
appeals
to
us
as
loving
christ
first
at
the
sepulchre
and
yet
when
he
meets
her
after
the
resurrection
he
had
for
her
the
comfort
only
of
the
chilling
words
touch
me
not
i
believe
it
there
were
thousands
of
heroic
women
then
there
are
heroic
women
now
think
of
the
women
who
cling
to
fallen
and
disgraced
husbands
day
by
day
until
they
reach
the
gutter
and
who
stoop
down
to
lift
them
from
that
position
and
raise
them
up
to
be
men
once
more
every
country
is
civilized
in
proportion
as
it
honors
woman
there
are
women
in
england
working
in
mines
deformed
by
labor
that
would
become
wild
beasts
were
it
not
for
the
love
they
bear
for
home
can
you
find
among
the
women
of
the
new
testament
any
women
that
can
equal
the
women
born
of
shakespeare
brain
you
can
find
no
woman
like
isabella
where
reason
and
purity
blend
into
perfect
truth
no
woman
like
juliet
where
passion
and
purity
meet
like
red
and
white
within
the
bosom
of
a
flower
no
woman
like
imogen
who
said
what
is
it
to
be
false
no
woman
like
cordelia
that
would
not
show
her
wealth
of
love
in
hope
of
gain
nor
like
hermione
who
bore
the
cross
of
shame
for
years
nor
like
miranda
who
told
her
love
as
the
flower
exposes
its
bosom
to
the
sun
nor
like
desdemona
who
was
so
pure
that
she
could
not
suspect
that
another
could
suspect
her
of
a
crime
and
we
are
told
that
woman
sinned
first
and
man
second
that
man
was
made
first
and
woman
not
till
afterwards
the
idea
is
that
we
could
have
gotten
along
without
the
woman
well
enough
but
they
never
could
have
gotten
along
without
us
i
tell
you
that
love
is
better
than
piety
love
is
better
than
all
the
ceremonial
worship
of
the
world
and
it
is
better
to
love
something
than
to
believe
anything
on
this
globe
so
this
minister
seeking
a
mark
to
throw
an
arrow
somewhere
trying
to
find
some
little
place
in
the
armor
charges
me
with
having
disparaged
queen
victoria
that
you
know
is
next
to
blasphemy
well
i
never
did
anything
of
the
kind
never
said
a
word
against
her
in
in
life
neither
as
wife
or
mother
or
queen
never
doubted
but
that
she
is
a
good
woman
enough
and
i
have
always
admitted
that
her
reputation
was
good
in
the
neighborhood
where
she
resides
i
never
had
any
other
opinion
all
i
said
in
the
world
was
i
was
endeavoring
to
show
that
we
are
now
to
have
an
aristocracy
of
brain
and
heart
that
is
all
and
i
said
of
louis
napoleon
he
was
not
satisfied
with
simply
being
an
emperor
and
having
a
little
crown
on
his
head
but
wanted
to
prove
that
he
had
something
in
his
head
so
he
wrote
the
life
of
julius
caesar
and
that
made
him
a
member
of
the
french
academy
and
speaking
of
king
william
upon
whose
head
is
the
divine
petroleum
of
authority
i
asked
how
he
would
like
to
exchange
brains
with
haeckel
the
philosopher
then
i
went
over
to
england
and
said
queen
victoria
wears
the
garment
of
power
given
her
by
blind
fortune
by
eyeless
chance
is
arrayed
in
robes
of
glory
woven
in
the
loom
of
her
own
genius
thereupon
i
am
charged
with
disparaging
a
woman
and
this
priest
in
order
to
get
even
with
me
digs
open
the
grave
of
george
eliot
and
endeavors
to
stain
her
unresisting
dust
he
calls
her
an
adulteress
the
vilest
word
in
the
languages
of
men
and
he
does
it
because
she
hated
the
presbyterian
creed
because
she
according
to
his
definition
was
an
atheist
because
she
lived
without
faith
and
died
without
fear
because
she
grandly
bore
the
taunts
and
slanders
of
the
christian
world
george
eliot
carried
tenderly
in
her
heart
the
faults
and
frailties
of
her
race
she
saw
the
highway
of
eternal
right
through
all
the
winding
paths
where
folly
vainly
stalks
with
hands
the
fading
flowers
of
selfish
joy
and
whatever
you
may
think
or
i
may
think
of
the
one
mistake
in
all
her
sad
and
loving
life
i
know
and
feel
that
in
the
court
where
her
conscience
sat
as
judge
she
stood
acquitted
pure
as
light
and
stainless
as
a
star
george
eliot
has
joined
the
choir
invisible
whose
music
is
the
gladness
of
this
world
and
her
wondrous
lines
her
touching
poems
will
be
read
hundreds
of
years
after
every
sermon
in
which
a
priest
has
sought
to
stain
her
name
shall
have
vanished
utterly
from
human
speech
how
appropriate
here
with
some
slight
change
the
words
of
laertes
at
ophelia
grave
lay
her
in
the
earth
and
from
her
fair
and
unpolluted
flesh
may
violets
spring
i
tell
thee
priest
and
minister
a
ministering
angel
shall
this
woman
be
when
thou
liest
howling
i
have
no
words
with
which
to
express
my
loathing
hatred
and
condemnation
of
the
man
who
will
stain
a
noble
woman
grave
the
next
argument
in
favor
of
the
sacred
scriptures
is
the
argument
of
numbers
and
this
minister
congratulates
himself
that
the
infidels
could
not
carry
a
precinct
or
a
county
or
a
state
in
the
united
states
well
i
tell
you
they
can
come
proportionately
near
it
just
in
proportion
that
that
part
of
the
country
is
educated
the
whole
world
does
move
together
in
one
life
there
has
to
be
some
man
to
take
a
step
forward
and
the
people
follow
and
when
they
get
where
that
man
was
some
other
titan
has
taken
another
step
and
you
can
see
him
there
on
the
great
mountain
of
progress
that
is
why
the
world
moves
there
must
be
pioneers
and
if
nobody
is
right
except
he
who
is
with
the
majority
then
we
must
turn
and
walk
toward
the
setting
sun
he
says
we
will
settle
this
by
suffrage
the
christian
religion
was
submitted
to
a
popular
vote
in
jerusalem
and
what
was
the
result
crucify
him
an
infamous
result
showing
that
you
ca
depend
on
the
vote
of
barbarians
but
i
am
told
that
there
are
christians
in
the
world
well
what
of
it
there
are
more
buddhists
and
they
say
what
a
number
of
bibles
are
printed
more
bibles
than
any
other
book
does
this
prove
anything
true
because
more
of
them
suppose
you
should
find
published
in
the
new
york
herald
something
about
you
and
you
should
go
to
the
editor
and
tell
him
that
is
a
lie
and
he
should
say
that
ca
be
the
herald
has
the
largest
circulation
of
any
paper
in
the
world
three
hundred
millions
of
christians
and
here
are
the
nations
that
prove
the
truth
of
christianity
russia
christians
i
am
willing
to
admit
it
a
country
without
freedom
of
speech
without
freedom
of
press
a
country
in
which
every
mouth
is
a
bastille
and
every
tongue
a
prisoner
for
life
a
country
in
which
assassins
are
the
best
men
in
it
they
call
that
christian
girls
sixteen
years
of
age
for
having
spoken
in
favor
of
human
liberty
are
now
working
in
siberian
mines
that
is
a
christian
country
only
a
little
while
ago
a
man
shot
at
the
emperor
twice
the
emperor
was
protected
by
his
armor
the
man
was
convicted
and
they
asked
him
if
he
wished
religious
consolation
no
do
you
believe
in
a
god
no
if
there
was
a
god
there
would
be
no
russia
sixteen
millions
of
christians
in
spain
spain
that
never
touched
a
shore
except
as
a
robber
spain
that
took
the
gold
and
silver
of
the
new
world
and
used
it
as
an
engine
of
oppression
in
the
old
a
country
in
which
cruelty
was
worship
in
which
murder
was
prayer
a
country
where
flourished
the
inquisition
i
admit
spain
is
a
christian
country
if
you
do
believe
it
i
do
read
the
history
of
holland
read
the
history
of
south
america
read
the
history
of
mexico
a
chapter
of
cruelty
beyond
the
power
of
language
to
express
i
admit
that
spain
is
orthodox
if
you
will
go
there
you
will
find
the
man
who
robs
you
and
asks
god
to
forgive
you
a
country
where
infidelity
has
made
much
headway
but
thank
god
where
there
is
even
yet
a
dawn
where
there
are
such
men
as
castelar
and
others
who
begin
to
see
that
one
schoolhouse
is
equal
to
three
cathedrals
and
one
teacher
worth
all
the
priests
italy
is
another
christian
nation
with
christians
in
italy
lives
the
only
authorized
agent
of
god
the
pope
for
hundreds
of
years
italy
was
the
beggar
of
the
earth
and
held
out
both
hands
gold
and
silver
flowed
from
every
land
into
her
palms
and
she
became
covered
with
nunneries
monasteries
and
the
pilgrims
of
the
world
italy
was
sacred
dust
her
soil
was
a
perpetual
blessing
her
sky
was
an
eternal
smile
italy
was
guilty
not
simply
of
the
death
of
the
catholic
church
but
italy
was
dead
and
buried
and
would
have
been
in
her
grave
still
had
it
not
been
for
mazzini
garibaldi
and
cavour
when
the
prophecy
of
garibaldi
shall
be
fulfilled
when
the
priests
with
spades
in
their
hands
shall
dig
ditches
to
drain
the
pontine
marshes
when
the
monasteries
shall
be
factories
when
the
whirling
wheels
of
industry
shall
drown
the
drowsy
and
hypocritical
prayers
then
and
not
till
then
will
italy
be
great
and
free
italy
is
the
only
instance
in
our
history
and
in
the
history
of
the
world
so
far
as
we
know
of
the
resurrection
of
a
nation
she
is
the
first
fruits
of
them
that
sleep
portugal
is
another
christian
country
she
made
her
living
in
the
slave
trade
for
centuries
i
admit
that
all
the
blessings
that
that
country
enjoyed
flowed
naturally
from
catholicism
and
we
believe
in
the
same
scriptures
if
you
do
believe
it
read
the
history
of
the
persecution
of
the
jewish
people
i
admit
that
germany
is
a
christian
nation
that
is
christians
are
in
power
when
the
bill
was
introduced
for
the
purpose
of
ameliorating
the
condition
of
the
jews
bismark
spoke
against
it
and
said
germany
is
a
christian
nation
and
therefore
we
can
not
pass
the
bill
austria
is
another
christian
nation
if
you
do
believe
it
read
the
history
of
hungary
and
if
you
still
have
doubts
read
the
history
of
the
partition
of
poland
but
there
is
one
good
thing
in
that
country
they
believe
in
education
and
education
is
the
enemy
of
ecclesiasticism
every
thoroughly
educated
man
is
his
own
church
and
his
own
pope
and
his
own
priest
they
tell
me
that
the
united
states
our
country
is
christian
i
deny
it
it
is
neither
christian
nor
pagan
it
is
human
our
fathers
retired
all
the
gods
from
politics
our
fathers
laid
down
the
doctrine
that
the
right
to
govern
comes
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
and
not
from
the
clouds
our
fathers
knew
that
if
they
put
an
infinite
god
in
the
constitution
there
would
be
no
room
left
for
the
people
our
fathers
used
the
language
of
lincoln
and
they
made
a
government
for
the
people
by
the
people
this
is
not
a
christian
country
some
gentleman
said
how
about
delaware
i
told
him
there
was
a
man
in
washington
some
twenty
or
thirty
years
ago
who
came
there
and
said
he
was
a
revolutionary
soldier
and
wanted
a
pension
he
was
so
bent
and
bowed
over
that
the
wind
blew
his
shoestrings
into
his
eyes
they
asked
him
how
old
he
was
and
he
said
fifty
years
why
good
man
you
ca
get
a
pension
because
the
war
was
over
before
you
were
born
you
must
fool
us
well
said
he
i
tell
you
the
truth
i
lived
sixty
years
in
delaware
but
i
never
count
it
and
hope
god
wo
and
these
christian
nations
which
have
been
brought
forward
as
the
witnesses
of
the
truth
of
the
scriptures
owe
which
represents
christian
war
christian
cannon
christian
shot
and
christian
shell
the
sum
is
so
great
that
the
imagination
is
dazed
in
its
contemplation
that
is
the
result
of
loving
your
neighbor
as
yourself
the
next
great
argument
brought
forward
by
these
gentlemen
is
the
persecution
of
the
jews
we
are
told
in
the
nineteenth
century
that
god
has
the
jews
persecuted
simply
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
the
authenticity
of
the
scriptures
and
every
jewish
home
burned
in
russia
throws
light
on
the
gospel
and
every
violated
jewish
maiden
is
another
evidence
that
god
still
takes
an
interest
in
the
holy
scriptures
that
is
their
doctrine
they
are
fulfilling
prophecy
the
christian
grasps
the
jew
strips
him
robs
him
makes
him
an
outcast
and
then
points
to
him
as
a
fulfillment
of
prophecy
and
we
are
today
laying
the
foundation
of
future
persecution
we
are
teaching
our
children
the
monstrous
falsehood
that
jews
crucified
god
and
the
nation
consented
they
crucified
a
good
man
what
nation
has
not
what
race
has
not
think
of
the
number
killed
by
the
presbyterians
by
the
catholics
every
sect
with
maybe
two
or
three
exceptions
have
crucified
their
fellows
and
every
race
has
burned
its
greatest
and
its
best
and
yet
we
are
filling
the
minds
of
children
with
hatred
of
the
jewish
people
it
is
a
poor
business
ah
but
they
say
these
people
are
cursed
by
god
i
say
they
never
had
any
good
fortune
until
the
jehovah
of
the
bible
deserted
them
whenever
they
have
had
a
reasonable
chance
they
have
been
the
most
prosperous
people
in
the
world
i
never
saw
one
begging
i
never
saw
one
in
the
criminal
dock
for
hundreds
of
years
they
were
not
allowed
to
own
any
land
for
hundreds
of
years
they
were
not
allowed
to
work
at
any
trade
they
were
driven
simply
to
dealing
in
money
and
in
precious
stones
and
things
of
that
character
and
by
a
kind
of
poetic
justice
they
have
today
the
control
of
the
money
of
the
world
i
am
glad
to
see
that
kings
and
emperors
go
to
the
offices
of
the
jews
with
their
hats
in
their
hands
to
have
their
notes
discounted
and
yet
i
am
told
by
clergymen
that
all
this
infamy
has
been
kept
up
simply
to
establish
the
truth
of
the
gospel
i
despise
such
doctrine
as
long
as
the
liberty
of
one
jew
is
unsafe
my
liberty
is
not
secure
liberty
for
all
and
not
until
then
will
the
liberty
of
any
be
assured
ah
but
says
this
man
nobody
ever
died
cheerfully
for
a
lie
the
jewish
people
have
suffered
persecution
for
years
and
they
have
suffered
it
cheerfully
if
this
doctrine
is
true
then
judaism
must
be
true
and
christianity
must
be
false
but
martyrdom
does
prove
the
truth
if
the
martyr
knows
it
it
simply
proves
the
barbarity
of
his
persecutors
and
has
no
sincerity
that
is
all
it
proves
but
you
must
remember
that
this
gentleman
who
believes
in
this
doctrine
is
a
presbyterian
and
why
should
a
presbyterian
object
after
a
few
hundred
years
of
burning
he
expects
to
enjoy
the
eternal
auto
da
fe
of
hell
an
auto
da
fe
that
will
be
presided
over
by
god
and
his
angels
and
they
will
be
expected
to
applaud
he
is
a
presbyterian
and
what
is
that
it
is
the
worst
religion
of
this
earth
i
admit
that
thousands
and
millions
of
presbyterians
are
good
people
no
man
ever
being
half
so
bad
as
his
creed
i
am
not
attacking
them
i
am
attacking
their
creed
i
am
attacking
what
this
religion
calls
tidings
of
great
joy
and
according
to
that
hundreds
of
billions
and
billions
of
years
ago
our
fate
was
irrevocably
and
forever
fixed
and
god
in
the
secret
counsels
of
his
own
inscrutable
will
made
up
his
mind
whom
he
would
save
and
whom
he
would
damn
when
thinking
of
that
god
i
always
think
of
the
mistake
of
a
methodist
preacher
during
the
war
he
commenced
the
prayer
and
never
did
one
more
appropriate
for
the
presbyterian
god
or
the
methodist
go
up
o
thou
great
and
unscrupulous
god
this
presbyterian
believes
that
billions
of
years
before
that
baby
in
the
cradle
that
little
dimpled
child
basking
in
the
light
of
a
mother
smile
was
born
god
had
made
up
his
mind
to
damn
it
and
when
talmage
looks
at
one
of
those
children
who
will
probably
be
damned
he
is
cheerful
about
it
he
enjoys
it
that
is
presbyterianism
that
god
made
man
and
damned
him
for
his
own
glory
if
there
is
such
a
god
i
hate
him
with
every
drop
of
my
blood
and
if
there
is
a
heaven
it
must
be
where
he
is
not
now
think
of
that
doctrine
only
a
little
while
ago
there
was
a
ship
from
liverpool
out
eighty
days
with
its
rudder
washed
away
for
ten
days
nothing
to
eat
nothing
but
the
bare
decks
and
hunger
and
the
captain
took
a
revolver
in
his
hand
and
put
it
to
his
brain
and
said
some
of
us
must
die
for
the
others
and
it
might
as
well
be
i
one
of
his
companions
grasped
the
pistol
and
said
captain
wait
wait
one
day
more
we
can
live
another
day
and
the
next
morning
the
horizon
was
rich
with
a
sail
and
they
were
saved
and
yet
if
presbyterianism
is
true
if
that
man
had
put
the
bullet
through
his
infinitely
generous
brain
so
that
his
comrades
could
have
eaten
of
his
flesh
and
reached
their
homes
and
felt
about
their
necks
the
dimpled
arms
of
children
and
the
kisses
of
wives
upon
their
lips
if
presbyterianism
be
true
god
had
a
constable
ready
there
to
clutch
that
soul
and
thrust
it
down
to
eternal
hell
tidings
of
great
joy
and
yet
this
is
religion
why
if
that
doctrine
be
true
every
soldier
in
the
revolutionary
war
who
died
not
a
christian
has
been
damned
every
one
in
the
war
of
who
kept
our
flag
upon
the
sea
if
he
died
not
a
christian
has
been
damned
and
every
one
in
the
civil
war
who
fought
to
keep
our
flag
in
heaven
not
a
christian
and
the
ones
who
died
in
andersonville
and
libby
not
christians
are
now
in
the
prison
of
god
where
the
famine
of
andersonville
and
libby
would
be
regarded
as
a
joy
orthodox
christianity
why
we
have
an
account
in
the
bible
it
comes
from
the
other
world
from
both
countries
from
heaven
and
from
hell
let
us
see
what
it
is
here
is
a
rich
man
who
dies
the
only
fault
about
him
was
he
was
rich
no
other
crime
was
charged
against
him
we
are
told
that
the
rich
man
died
and
when
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
he
found
no
sympathy
yet
even
in
hell
he
remembered
his
five
brethren
and
prayed
that
some
one
should
be
sent
to
them
so
that
they
should
not
come
there
i
tell
you
i
had
rather
be
in
hell
with
human
sympathy
than
in
heaven
without
it
the
bible
is
not
inspired
and
ministers
know
nothing
about
another
world
they
do
know
i
am
satisfied
there
is
no
world
of
eternal
pain
if
there
is
a
world
of
joy
so
much
the
better
i
have
never
put
out
the
faintest
star
of
human
hope
that
ever
trembled
in
the
night
of
life
there
was
a
time
when
i
was
not
after
that
i
was
now
i
am
and
it
is
just
as
probable
that
i
will
live
again
as
it
was
that
i
could
have
lived
before
i
did
let
it
go
ah
but
what
will
life
be
the
world
will
be
here
men
and
women
will
be
here
the
page
of
history
will
be
open
the
walls
of
the
world
will
be
adorned
with
art
the
niches
with
sculpture
music
will
be
here
and
all
there
is
of
life
and
joy
and
there
will
be
homes
here
and
the
fireside
and
there
will
be
a
common
hope
without
a
common
fear
love
will
be
here
and
love
is
the
only
bow
on
life
dark
cloud
love
was
the
first
to
dream
of
immortality
love
is
the
morning
and
evening
star
it
shines
upon
the
child
it
sheds
its
radiance
upon
the
peaceful
tomb
love
is
the
mother
of
beauty
the
mother
of
melody
for
music
is
its
voice
love
is
the
builder
of
every
hope
the
kindler
of
every
fire
on
every
hearth
love
is
the
enchanter
the
magician
that
changes
worthless
things
to
joy
and
makes
right
royal
kings
and
queens
out
of
common
clay
love
is
the
perfume
of
that
wondrous
flower
the
heart
without
that
divine
passion
without
that
divine
sway
we
are
less
than
beasts
and
with
it
earth
is
heaven
and
we
are
gods
ingersoll
oration
at
a
child
grave
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
congressional
cemetery
at
washington
a
small
group
of
people
with
uncovered
heads
were
ranged
around
a
grave
they
included
detective
and
george
miller
and
family
and
friends
who
had
gathered
to
witness
the
burial
of
the
bright
little
son
harry
as
the
casket
rested
upon
the
trestles
there
was
a
painful
pause
broken
only
by
the
mother
sobs
until
the
undertaker
advanced
toward
a
stout
gentleman
in
the
party
and
whispered
to
him
the
words
being
inaudible
to
the
this
gentleman
was
robert
ingersoll
a
friend
of
the
millers
who
had
attended
the
funeral
at
their
request
he
shook
his
head
when
the
undertaker
first
addressed
him
and
then
said
suddenly
does
miller
desire
it
the
undertaker
gave
an
affirmative
nod
miller
looked
appealingly
toward
the
distinguished
orator
and
then
colonel
ingersoll
advanced
to
the
side
of
the
grave
made
a
motion
denoting
a
desire
for
silence
and
in
a
voice
of
exquisite
cadence
delivered
one
of
his
characteristic
eulogies
for
the
dead
the
scene
was
intensely
dramatic
a
fine
drizzling
rain
was
falling
and
every
head
was
bent
and
every
ear
turned
to
catch
the
impassioned
words
of
eloquence
and
hope
that
fell
from
the
lips
of
the
famed
orator
colonel
ingersoll
was
unprotected
by
either
hat
or
umbrella
his
invocation
thrilled
his
hearers
with
awe
each
eye
that
had
previously
been
bedimmed
with
tears
brightening
and
sobs
becoming
hushed
the
colonel
said
my
friends
i
know
how
vain
it
is
to
gild
a
grief
with
words
and
yet
i
wish
to
take
from
every
grave
its
fear
here
in
this
world
where
life
and
death
are
equal
kings
all
should
be
brave
enough
to
meet
what
all
have
met
the
future
has
been
filled
with
fear
stained
and
polluted
by
the
heartless
past
from
the
wondrous
tree
of
life
the
buds
and
blossoms
fall
with
ripened
fruit
and
in
the
common
bed
of
earth
patriarchs
and
babes
sleep
side
by
side
why
should
we
fear
that
which
will
come
to
all
that
is
we
can
not
tell
we
do
not
know
which
is
the
greatest
blessing
life
or
death
we
can
not
say
that
death
is
not
good
we
do
not
know
whether
the
grave
is
the
end
of
this
life
or
the
door
of
another
or
whether
the
night
here
is
not
somewhere
else
a
dawn
neither
can
we
tell
which
is
the
more
fortunate
the
child
dying
in
its
mother
arms
before
its
lips
have
learned
to
form
a
word
or
he
who
journeys
all
the
length
of
life
uneven
road
painfully
taking
the
last
slow
steps
with
staff
and
crutch
every
cradle
asks
us
whence
and
every
coffin
whither
the
poor
barbarian
weeping
above
his
dead
can
answer
the
question
as
intelligently
and
satisfactorily
as
the
robed
priest
of
the
most
authentic
creed
the
tearful
ignorance
of
the
one
is
just
as
consoling
as
the
learned
and
unmeaning
words
of
the
other
no
man
standing
where
the
horizon
of
a
life
has
touched
a
grave
has
any
right
to
prophesy
a
future
filled
with
pain
and
tears
it
may
be
that
death
gives
all
there
is
of
worth
to
life
if
those
who
press
and
strain
against
our
hearts
could
never
die
perhaps
that
love
would
wither
from
the
earth
maybe
a
common
faith
treads
from
out
the
paths
between
our
hearts
the
weeds
of
selfishness
and
i
should
rather
live
and
love
where
death
is
king
than
have
eternal
life
where
love
is
not
another
life
is
naught
unless
we
know
and
love
again
the
ones
who
love
us
here
they
who
stand
with
breaking
hearts
around
this
little
grave
need
have
no
fear
the
largest
and
the
nobler
faith
in
all
that
is
and
is
to
be
tells
us
that
death
even
at
its
worst
is
only
perfect
rest
we
know
that
through
the
common
wants
of
life
the
needs
and
duties
of
each
hour
their
grief
will
lessen
day
by
day
until
at
last
these
graves
will
be
to
them
a
place
of
rest
and
peace
almost
of
joy
there
is
for
them
this
consolation
the
dead
do
not
suffer
if
they
live
again
their
lives
will
surely
be
as
good
as
ours
we
have
no
fear
we
are
all
children
of
the
same
mother
and
the
same
fate
awaits
us
all
we
too
have
our
religion
and
it
is
this
help
for
the
living
hope
for
the
dead
ingersoll
at
his
brother
a
most
exquisite
yet
one
of
the
most
sad
and
mournful
sermons
the
funeral
of
hon
ebon
ingersoll
brother
of
robert
ingersoll
of
illinois
took
place
at
his
residence
in
washington
june
the
ceremonies
were
extremely
simple
consisting
merely
of
viewing
the
remains
by
relatives
and
friends
and
a
funeral
oration
by
robert
ingersoll
brother
of
the
deceased
a
large
number
of
distinguished
gentlemen
were
present
including
secretary
sherman
assistant
secretary
hawley
senators
blaine

ward

hon
jeremiah

of
indiana
and
hon
thomas
boyd
of
illinois
soon
after
ingersoll
began
to
read
his
eloquent
characterization
of
the
dead
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
tried
to
hide
them
behind
his
but
he
could
not
do
it
and
finally
he
bowed
his
head
upon
the
dead
man
coffin
in
uncontrollable
grief
it
was
after
some
delay
and
the
greatest
efforts
of
that
ingersoll
was
able
to
finish
reading
his
address
which
was
as
follows
my
friends
i
am
going
to
do
that
which
the
dead
often
promised
he
would
do
for
me
the
loved
and
loving
brother
husband
father
friend
died
where
manhood
morning
almost
touches
noon
and
while
the
shadows
still
were
falling
toward
the
west
he
had
not
passed
on
life
highway
the
stone
that
marks
the
highest
point
but
being
weary
for
a
moment
he
lay
down
by
the
wayside
and
using
his
burden
for
a
pillow
fell
into
that
dreamless
sleep
that
kisses
down
his
eyelids
still
while
yet
in
love
with
life
and
raptured
with
the
world
he
passed
to
silence
and
pathetic
dust
yet
after
all
it
may
be
best
just
in
the
happiest
sunniest
hour
of
all
the
voyage
while
eager
winds
are
kissing
every
sail
to
dash
against
the
unseen
rock
and
in
an
instant
hear
the
billows
roar
over
a
sunken
ship
for
whether
in
or
among
the
breakers
of
the
farther
shore
a
wreck
must
mark
at
last
the
end
of
each
and
all
and
every
life
no
matter
if
its
every
hour
is
rich
with
love
and
every
moment
jeweled
with
a
joy
will
at
its
close
become
a
tragedy
as
sad
and
deep
and
dark
as
can
be
woven
of
the
warp
and
woof
of
mystery
and
death
this
brave
and
tender
man
in
every
storm
of
life
was
oak
and
rock
but
in
the
sunshine
he
was
vine
and
flower
he
was
the
friend
of
all
heroic
souls
he
climbed
the
heights
and
left
all
superstitions
far
below
while
on
his
forehead
fell
the
golden
dawning
of
a
grander
day
he
loved
the
beautiful
and
was
with
color
form
and
music
touched
to
tears
he
sided
with
the
weak
and
with
a
willing
hand
gave
alms
with
loyal
heart
and
with
the
purest
hand
he
faithful
discharged
all
public
trusts
he
was
a
worshiper
of
liberty
and
a
friend
of
the
oppressed
a
thousand
times
i
have
heard
him
quote
the
words
for
justice
all
place
a
temple
and
all
season
summer
he
believed
that
happiness
was
the
only
good
reason
the
only
torch
justice
the
only
worshiper
humanity
the
only
religion
and
love
the
priest
he
added
to
the
sum
of
human
joy
and
were
every
one
for
whom
he
did
some
loving
service
to
bring
a
blossom
to
his
grave
he
would
sleep
tonight
beneath
a
wilderness
of
flowers
life
is
a
narrow
vale
between
the
cold
and
barren
peaks
of
two
eternities
we
strive
in
vain
to
look
beyond
the
heights
we
cry
aloud
and
the
only
answer
is
the
echo
of
our
wailing
cry
from
the
voiceless
lips
of
the
unreplying
dead
there
comes
no
word
but
in
the
night
of
death
hope
sees
a
star
and
listening
love
can
hear
the
rustle
of
a
wing
he
who
sleeps
here
when
dying
mistaking
the
approach
of
death
for
the
return
of
health
whispered
with
his
latest
breath
i
am
better
now
let
us
believe
in
spite
of
doubts
and
dogmas
and
tears
and
fears
that
these
dear
words
are
true
of
all
the
countless
dead
and
now
to
you
who
have
been
chosen
from
among
the
many
men
he
loved
to
do
the
last
sad
office
for
the
dead
we
give
his
sacred
dust
speech
can
not
contain
our
love
there
was
there
is
no
gentler
stronger
manlier
man
ingersoll
lecture
on
the
mistakes
of
moses
now
and
then
some
one
asks
me
why
i
am
endeavoring
to
interfere
with
the
religious
faith
of
others
and
why
i
try
to
take
from
the
world
the
consolation
naturally
arising
from
a
belief
in
eternal
fire
and
i
answer
i
want
to
do
what
little
i
can
to
make
my
country
truly
free
i
want
to
broaden
the
intellectual
horizon
of
our
people
i
want
it
so
that
we
can
differ
upon
all
those
questions
and
yet
grasp
each
hands
in
genuine
friendship
i
want
in
the
first
place
to
free
the
clergy
i
am
a
great
friend
of
theirs
but
they
do
seem
to
have
found
it
out
generally
i
want
it
so
that
every
minister
will
be
not
a
parrot
not
an
owl
sitting
upon
the
limb
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
hooting
the
hoots
that
have
been
hooted
for
eighteen
hundred
years
but
i
want
it
so
that
each
one
can
be
an
investigator
a
thinker
and
i
want
to
make
his
congregation
grand
enough
so
that
they
will
not
only
allow
him
to
think
but
will
demand
that
he
shall
think
and
give
to
them
the
honest
truth
of
his
thought
as
it
is
now
ministers
are
employed
like
attorneys
for
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant
if
a
few
people
know
of
a
young
man
in
the
neighborhood
maybe
who
has
not
a
good
constitution
he
may
not
be
healthy
enough
to
be
wicked
a
young
man
who
has
shown
no
decided
talent
it
occurs
to
them
to
make
him
a
minister
they
contribute
and
send
him
to
some
school
if
it
turns
out
that
that
young
man
has
more
of
the
man
in
him
than
they
thought
and
he
changes
his
opinion
everyone
who
contributed
will
feel
himself
individually
swindled
and
they
will
follow
that
young
man
to
the
grave
with
the
poisoned
shafts
of
malice
and
slander
i
want
it
so
that
every
one
will
be
free
so
that
a
pulpit
will
not
be
a
pillory
they
have
in
massachusetts
at
a
place
called
andover
a
kind
of
minister
factory
and
every
professor
in
that
factory
takes
an
oath
once
in
every
five
years
that
is
as
long
as
an
oath
will
last
that
not
only
has
he
not
during
the
last
five
years
but
so
help
him
god
he
will
not
during
the
next
five
years
intellectually
advance
and
probably
there
is
no
oath
he
could
easier
keep
since
the
foundation
of
that
institution
there
has
not
been
one
case
of
perjury
they
believe
the
same
creed
they
first
taught
when
the
foundation
stone
was
laid
and
now
when
they
send
out
a
minister
they
brand
him
as
hardware
from
sheffield
and
birmingham
and
every
man
who
knows
where
he
was
educated
knows
his
creed
knows
every
argument
of
his
creed
every
book
that
he
reads
and
just
what
he
amounts
to
intellectually
and
knows
he
will
shrink
and
shrivel
and
become
solemnly
stupid
day
after
day
until
he
meets
with
death
it
is
all
wrong
it
is
cruel
those
men
should
be
allowed
to
grow
they
should
have
the
air
of
liberty
and
the
sunshine
of
thought
i
want
to
free
the
schools
of
our
country
i
want
it
so
that
when
a
professor
in
a
college
finds
some
fact
inconsistent
with
moses
he
will
not
hide
the
fact
i
wish
to
see
an
eternal
divorce
and
separation
between
church
and
schools
the
common
school
is
the
bread
of
life
but
there
should
be
nothing
taught
except
what
somebody
knows
and
anything
else
should
not
be
maintained
by
a
system
of
general
taxation
i
want
its
professors
so
that
they
will
tell
everything
they
find
that
they
will
be
free
to
investigate
in
every
direction
and
will
not
be
trammeled
by
the
superstitions
of
our
day
what
has
religion
to
do
with
facts
nothing
is
there
any
such
thing
as
methodist
mathematics
presbyterian
botany
catholic
astronomy
or
baptist
biology
what
has
any
form
of
superstition
or
religion
to
do
with
a
fact
or
with
any
science
nothing
but
to
hinder
delay
or
embarrass
i
want
then
to
free
the
schools
and
i
want
to
free
the
politicians
so
that
a
man
will
not
have
to
pretend
he
is
a
methodist
or
his
wife
a
baptist
or
his
grandmother
a
catholic
so
that
he
can
go
through
a
campaign
and
when
he
gets
through
will
find
none
of
the
dust
of
hypocrisy
on
his
knees
i
want
the
people
splendid
enough
that
when
they
desire
men
to
make
laws
for
them
they
will
take
one
who
knows
something
who
has
brains
enough
to
prophesy
the
destiny
of
the
american
republic
no
matter
what
his
opinions
may
be
upon
any
religious
subject
suppose
we
are
in
a
storm
out
at
sea
and
the
billows
are
washing
over
our
ship
and
it
is
necessary
that
some
one
should
reef
the
topsail
and
a
man
presents
himself
would
you
stop
him
at
the
foot
of
the
mast
to
find
out
his
opinion
on
the
five
points
of
calvinism
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
congress
has
nothing
to
do
with
baptism
or
any
particular
creed
and
from
what
little
experience
i
have
had
in
washington
very
little
to
do
with
any
kind
of
religion
whatever
now
i
hope
this
afternoon
this
magnificent
and
splendid
audience
will
forget
that
they
are
baptists
or
methodists
and
remember
that
they
are
men
and
women
these
are
the
highest
titles
humanity
can
bear
and
every
title
you
add
belittles
them
man
is
the
highest
woman
is
the
highest
let
us
remember
that
our
views
depend
largely
upon
the
country
in
which
we
happen
to
live
suppose
we
were
born
in
turkey
most
of
us
would
have
been
mohammedans
and
when
we
read
in
the
book
that
when
mohammed
visited
heaven
he
became
acquainted
with
an
angel
named
gabriel
who
was
so
broad
between
his
eyes
that
it
would
take
a
smart
camel
three
hundred
days
to
make
the
journey
we
probably
would
have
believed
it
if
we
did
not
people
would
say
that
young
man
is
dangerous
he
is
trying
to
tear
down
the
fabric
of
our
religion
what
do
you
propose
to
give
us
instead
of
that
angel
we
can
not
afford
to
trade
off
an
angel
of
that
size
for
nothing
or
if
we
had
been
born
in
india
we
would
have
believed
in
a
god
with
three
heads
now
we
believe
in
three
gods
with
one
head
and
so
we
might
make
a
tour
of
the
world
and
see
that
every
superstition
that
could
be
imagined
by
the
brain
of
man
has
been
in
some
place
held
to
be
sacred
now
some
one
says
the
religion
of
my
father
and
mother
is
good
enough
for
me
suppose
we
all
said
that
where
would
be
the
progress
of
the
world
we
would
have
the
rudest
and
most
barbaric
religion
religion
which
no
one
could
believe
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
showing
real
respect
to
our
parents
to
believe
something
simply
because
they
did
every
good
father
and
every
good
mother
wish
their
children
to
find
out
more
than
they
knew
every
good
father
wants
his
son
to
overcome
some
obstacle
that
he
could
not
grapple
with
and
if
you
wish
to
reflect
credit
on
your
father
and
mother
do
it
by
accomplishing
more
than
they
did
because
you
live
in
a
better
time
every
nation
has
had
what
you
call
a
sacred
record
and
the
older
the
more
sacred
the
more
contradictory
and
the
more
inspired
is
the
record
we
of
course
are
not
an
exception
and
i
propose
to
talk
a
little
about
what
is
called
the
pentateuch
a
book
or
a
collection
of
books
said
to
have
been
written
by
moses
and
right
here
in
the
commencement
let
me
say
that
moses
never
wrote
one
word
of
the
pentateuch
not
one
word
was
written
until
he
had
been
dust
and
ashes
for
hundreds
of
years
but
as
the
general
opinion
is
that
moses
wrote
these
books
i
have
entitled
this
lecture
the
mistakes
of
moses
for
the
sake
of
this
lecture
we
will
admit
that
he
wrote
it
nearly
every
maker
of
religion
has
commenced
by
making
the
world
and
it
is
one
of
the
safest
things
to
do
because
no
one
can
contradict
as
having
been
present
and
it
gives
free
scope
to
the
imagination
these
books
in
times
when
there
was
a
vast
difference
between
the
educated
and
the
ignorant
became
inspired
and
people
bowed
down
and
worshiped
them
i
saw
a
little
while
ago
a
bible
with
immense
oaken
covers
with
hasps
and
clasps
large
enough
almost
for
a
penitentiary
and
i
can
imagine
how
that
book
would
be
regarded
by
barbarians
in
europe
when
not
more
than
one
person
in
a
dozen
could
read
and
write
in
imagination
i
saw
it
carried
into
the
cathedral
heard
the
chant
of
the
priest
saw
the
swinging
of
the
censer
and
the
smoke
rising
and
when
that
bible
was
put
on
the
altar
i
can
imagine
the
barbarians
looking
at
it
and
wondering
what
influence
that
book
could
have
on
their
lives
and
future
i
do
not
wonder
that
they
imagined
it
was
inspired
none
of
them
could
write
a
book
and
consequently
when
they
saw
it
they
adored
it
they
were
stricken
with
awe
and
rascals
took
advantage
of
that
awe
now
they
say
that
the
book
is
inspired
i
do
not
care
whether
it
is
or
not
the
question
is
is
it
true
if
it
is
true
it
does
need
to
be
inspired
nothing
needs
inspiration
except
a
falsehood
or
a
mistake
a
fact
never
went
into
partnership
with
a
miracle
truth
scorns
the
assistance
of
wonders
a
fact
will
fit
every
other
fact
in
the
universe
and
that
is
how
you
can
tell
whether
it
is
or
not
a
fact
a
lie
will
not
fit
anything
except
a
lie
made
for
the
express
purpose
and
finally
some
one
gets
tired
of
lying
and
the
last
lie
will
not
fit
the
next
fact
and
then
there
is
a
chance
for
inspiration
right
then
and
there
a
miracle
is
needed
the
real
question
is
in
the
light
of
science
in
the
light
of
the
brain
and
heart
of
the
nineteenth
century
is
this
book
true
the
gentleman
who
wrote
it
begins
by
telling
us
that
god
made
the
universe
out
of
nothing
that
i
can
not
conceive
it
may
be
so
but
i
can
not
conceive
it
nothing
in
the
light
of
raw
material
is
to
my
mind
a
decided
and
disastrous
failure
i
can
not
imagine
of
nothing
being
made
into
something
any
more
than
i
can
of
something
being
changed
back
into
nothing
i
can
not
conceive
of
force
aside
from
matter
because
force
to
be
force
must
be
active
and
unless
there
is
matter
there
is
nothing
for
force
to
act
upon
and
consequently
it
can
not
be
active
so
i
simply
say
i
can
not
comprehend
it
i
can
not
believe
it
i
may
roast
for
this
but
it
is
my
honest
opinion
the
next
thing
he
proceeds
to
tell
us
is
that
god
divided
the
darkness
from
the
light
and
right
here
let
me
say
when
i
speak
about
god
i
simply
mean
the
being
described
by
the
jews
there
may
be
in
immensity
a
being
beneath
whose
wing
the
universe
exists
whose
every
thought
is
a
glittering
star
but
i
know
nothing
about
him
not
the
slightest
and
this
afternoon
i
am
simply
talking
about
the
being
described
by
the
jewish
people
when
i
say
god
i
mean
him
moses
describes
god
dividing
the
light
from
the
darkness
i
suppose
that
at
that
time
they
must
have
been
mixed
you
can
readily
see
how
light
and
darkness
can
get
mixed
they
must
have
been
entities
the
reason
i
think
so
is
because
in
that
same
book
i
find
that
darkness
overspread
egypt
so
thick
that
it
could
be
felt
and
they
used
to
have
on
exhibition
in
rome
a
bottle
of
the
darkness
that
once
overspread
egypt
the
gentleman
who
wrote
this
in
imagination
saw
god
dividing
light
from
the
darkness
i
am
sure
the
man
who
wrote
it
believed
darkness
to
be
an
entity
a
something
a
tangible
thing
that
can
be
mixed
with
light
the
next
thing
that
he
informs
us
is
that
god
divided
the
waters
above
the
firmament
from
those
below
the
firmament
the
man
who
wrote
that
believed
the
firmament
to
be
a
solid
affair
and
that
is
what
the
gods
did
you
recollect
the
gods
came
down
and
made
love
to
the
daughters
of
men
and
i
never
blamed
them
for
it
i
have
never
read
a
description
of
any
heaven
i
would
not
leave
on
the
same
errand
that
is
where
the
gods
lived
there
is
where
they
kept
the
water
it
was
solid
that
is
the
reason
the
people
prayed
for
rain
they
believed
that
an
angel
could
take
a
lever
raise
a
window
and
let
out
the
desired
quantity
i
find
in
the
psalms
that
he
bowed
the
heavens
and
came
down
and
we
read
that
the
children
of
men
built
a
tower
to
reach
the
heavens
and
climb
into
the
abode
of
the
gods
the
man
who
wrote
that
believed
the
firmament
to
be
solid
he
knew
nothing
about
the
laws
of
evaporation
he
did
not
know
that
the
sun
wooed
with
amorous
kiss
the
waves
of
the
sea
and
that
disappointed
their
vaporous
sighs
changed
to
tears
and
fell
again
as
rain
the
next
thing
he
tells
us
is
that
the
grass
began
to
grow
and
the
branches
of
the
trees
laughed
into
blossom
and
the
grass
ran
up
the
shoulder
of
the
hills
and
yet
not
a
solitary
ray
of
light
had
left
the
eternal
quiver
of
the
sun
not
a
blade
of
grass
had
ever
been
touched
by
a
gleam
of
light
and
i
do
not
think
that
grass
will
grow
to
hurt
without
a
gleam
of
sunshine
i
think
the
man
who
wrote
that
simply
made
a
mistake
and
is
excusable
to
a
certain
degree
the
next
day
he
made
the
sun
and
moon
the
sun
to
rule
the
day
and
the
moon
to
rule
the
night
do
you
think
the
man
who
wrote
that
knew
anything
about
the
size
of
the
sun
i
think
he
thought
it
was
about
three
feet
in
diameter
because
i
find
in
some
book
that
the
sun
was
stopped
a
whole
day
to
give
a
general
named
joshua
time
to
kill
a
few
more
amalekites
and
the
moon
was
stopped
also
now
it
seems
to
me
that
the
sun
would
give
light
enough
without
stopping
the
moon
but
as
they
were
in
the
stopping
business
they
did
it
just
for
devilment
at
another
time
we
read
the
sun
was
turned
ten
degrees
backward
to
convince
hezekiah
that
he
was
not
going
to
die
of
a
boil
how
much
easier
it
would
have
been
to
cure
the
boil
the
man
who
wrote
that
thought
the
sun
was
two
or
three
feet
in
diameter
and
could
be
stopped
and
pulled
around
like
the
sun
and
moon
in
a
theatre
do
you
know
that
the
sun
throws
out
every
second
of
time
as
much
heat
as
could
be
generated
by
burning
eleven
thousand
millions
tons
of
coal
i
do
believe
he
knew
that
or
that
he
knew
the
motion
of
the
earth
i
do
believe
he
knew
that
it
was
turning
on
its
axis
at
the
rate
of
a
thousand
miles
an
hour
because
if
he
did
he
would
have
understood
the
immensity
of
heat
that
would
have
been
generated
by
stopping
the
world
it
has
been
calculated
by
one
of
the
best
mathematicians
and
astronomers
that
to
stop
the
world
would
cause
as
much
heat
as
it
would
take
to
burn
a
lump
of
solid
coal
three
times
as
big
as
the
globe
and
yet
we
find
in
that
book
that
the
sun
was
not
only
stopped
but
turned
back
ten
degrees
simply
to
convince
a
gentleman
that
he
was
not
going
to
die
of
a
boil
they
will
say
i
will
be
damned
if
i
do
not
believe
that
and
i
tell
them
i
will
if
i
do
then
he
gives
us
the
history
of
astronomy
and
he
gives
it
to
us
in
five
words
he
made
the
stars
also
he
came
very
near
forgetting
the
stars
do
you
believe
that
the
man
who
wrote
that
knew
that
there
are
stars
as
much
larger
than
this
earth
as
this
earth
is
larger
than
the
apple
which
adam
and
eve
are
said
to
have
eaten
do
you
believe
that
he
knew
that
this
world
is
but
a
speck
in
the
shining
glittering
universe
of
existence
i
would
gather
from
that
that
he
made
the
stars
after
he
got
the
world
done
the
telescope
in
reading
the
infinite
leaves
of
the
heavens
has
ascertained
that
light
travels
at
the
rate
of
miles
per
second
and
it
would
require
millions
of
years
to
come
from
some
of
the
stars
to
this
earth
yet
the
beams
of
those
stars
mingle
in
our
atmosphere
so
that
if
those
distant
orbs
were
fashioned
when
this
world
began
we
must
have
been
whirling
in
space
not
six
thousand
but
many
millions
of
years
do
you
believe
the
man
who
wrote
that
as
a
history
of
astronomy
really
knew
that
this
world
was
but
a
speck
compared
with
millions
of
sparkling
orbs
i
do
not
he
then
proceeds
to
tell
us
that
god
made
fish
and
cattle
and
that
man
and
woman
were
created
male
and
female
the
first
account
stops
at
the
second
verse
of
the
second
chapter
you
see
the
bible
originally
was
not
divided
into
chapters
the
first
bible
that
was
ever
divided
into
chapters
in
our
language
was
made
in
the
year
of
grace
the
bible
was
originally
written
in
the
hebrew
language
and
the
hebrew
language
at
that
time
had
no
vowels
in
writing
it
was
written
with
consonants
and
without
being
divided
into
chapters
or
into
verses
and
there
was
no
system
of
punctuation
whatever
after
you
go
home
tonight
write
an
english
sentence
or
two
with
only
consonants
close
together
and
you
will
find
that
it
will
take
twice
as
much
inspiration
to
read
it
as
it
did
to
write
it
when
the
bible
was
divided
into
verses
and
chapters
the
divisions
were
not
always
correct
and
so
the
division
between
the
first
and
second
chapter
of
genesis
is
not
in
the
right
place
the
second
account
of
the
creation
commences
at
the
third
verse
and
it
differs
from
the
first
in
two
essential
points
in
the
first
account
man
is
the
last
made
in
the
second
man
is
made
before
the
beasts
in
the
first
account
man
is
made
male
and
female
in
the
second
only
a
male
is
made
and
there
is
no
intention
of
making
a
woman
whatever
you
will
find
by
reading
that
second
chapter
that
god
tried
to
palm
off
on
adam
a
beast
as
his
helpmeet
everybody
talks
about
the
bible
and
nobody
reads
it
that
is
the
reason
it
is
so
generally
believed
i
am
probably
the
only
man
in
the
united
states
who
has
read
the
bible
through
this
year
i
have
wasted
that
time
but
i
had
a
purpose
in
view
just
read
it
and
you
will
find
about
the
verse
that
god
caused
all
the
animals
to
walk
before
adam
in
order
that
he
might
name
them
and
the
animals
came
like
a
menagerie
into
town
and
as
adam
looked
at
all
the
crawlers
jumpers
and
creepers
this
god
stood
by
to
see
what
he
would
call
them
after
this
procession
passed
it
was
pathetically
remarked
yet
was
there
not
found
any
helpmeet
for
adam
adam
did
see
anything
that
he
could
fancy
and
i
am
glad
he
did
if
he
had
there
would
not
have
been
a
in
this
world
we
should
have
all
died
orthodox
and
finding
adam
was
so
particular
god
had
to
make
him
a
helpmeet
and
having
used
up
the
nothing
he
was
compelled
to
take
part
of
the
man
to
make
the
woman
with
and
he
took
from
the
man
a
rib
how
did
he
get
it
and
then
imagine
a
god
with
a
bone
in
his
hand
and
about
to
start
a
woman
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
to
make
a
blonde
or
a
brunette
right
here
it
is
only
proper
that
i
should
warn
you
of
the
consequences
of
laughing
at
any
story
in
the
bible
when
you
come
to
die
your
laughing
at
this
story
will
be
a
thorn
in
your
pillow
as
you
look
back
upon
the
record
of
your
life
no
matter
how
many
men
you
have
wrecked
and
ruined
and
no
matter
how
many
women
you
have
deceived
and
deserted
all
that
may
be
forgiven
you
but
if
you
recollect
that
you
have
laughed
at
god
book
you
will
see
through
the
shadows
of
death
the
leering
looks
of
fiends
and
the
forked
tongues
of
devils
let
me
show
you
how
it
will
be
for
instance
it
is
the
day
of
judgment
when
the
man
is
called
up
by
the
recording
secretary
or
whoever
does
the
he
says
to
his
soul
where
are
you
from
i
am
from
the
world
yes
sir
what
kind
of
a
man
were
you
well
i
like
to
talk
about
myself
but
you
have
to
what
kind
of
a
man
were
you

i
was
a
good
fellow
i
loved
my
wife
i
loved
my
children
my
home

my
heaven

my
paradise
and
to
sit
there
and
see
the
lights
and
shadows
falling
on
the
faces
of
those
i
love
that
to
me
was
a
perpetual
joy
i
never
gave
one
of
them
a
solitary
moment
of
pain
i
do
owe
a
dollar
in
the
world
and
i
left
enough
to
pay
my
funeral
expenses
and
keep
the
wolf
of
want
from
the
door
of
the
house
i
loved
that
is
the
kind
of
a
man
i
am
did
you
belong
to
any
church
i
did
not
they
were
too
narrow
for
me
they
were
always
expecting
to
be
happy
simply
because
somebody
else
was
to
be
damned
well
did
you
believe
that
rib
story
what
rib
story
do
you
mean
that
adam
and
eve
business
no
i
did
not
to
tell
you
the
truth
that
was
a
little
more
than
i
could
swallow
to
hell
with
him
next
where
are
you
from
i
from
the
world
too
do
you
belong
to
any
church
yes
sir
and
to
the
young
men
christian
association
what
is
your
business
cashier
in
a
bank
did
you
ever
run
off
with
any
money
i
do
like
to
tell
sir
well
you
have
to
yes
sir
i
did
what
kind
of
a
bank
did
you
have
a
savings
bank
how
much
did
you
run
off
with
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
did
you
take
anything
else
along
with
you
yes
sir
what
i
took
my
neighbor
wife
did
you
have
a
wife
and
children
of
your
own
yes
sir
and
you
deserted
them
oh
yes
but
such
was
my
confidence
in
god
that
i
believed
he
would
take
care
of
them
have
you
heard
of
them
since
no
sir
did
you
believe
that
rib
story
ah
bless
your
soul
yes
i
believe
all
of
it
sir
i
often
used
to
be
sorry
that
there
were
not
harder
stories
yet
in
the
bible
so
that
i
could
show
what
my
faith
could
do
you
believed
it
did
you
yes
with
all
my
heart
give
him
a
harp
i
simply
wanted
to
show
you
how
important
it
is
to
believe
these
stories
of
all
the
authors
in
the
world
god
hates
a
critic
the
worst
having
got
this
woman
done
he
brought
her
to
the
man
and
they
started
and
a
few
minutes
afterward
a
snake
came
through
a
crack
in
the
fence
and
commenced
to
talk
with
her
on
the
subject
of
fruit
she
was
not
acquainted
in
the
neighborhood
and
she
did
not
know
whether
snakes
talked
or
not
or
whether
they
knew
anything
about
the
apples
or
not
well
she
was
misled
and
the
husband
ate
some
of
those
apples
and
laid
it
all
on
his
wife
and
there
is
where
the
mistake
was
made
god
ought
to
have
rubbed
him
out
at
once
he
might
have
known
that
no
good
could
come
of
starting
the
world
with
a
man
like
that
they
were
turned
out
then
the
trouble
commenced
and
people
got
worse
and
worse
god
you
must
recollect
was
holding
the
reins
of
government
but
he
did
nothing
for
them
he
allowed
them
to
live
six
hundred
and
years
without
knowing
their
a
he
never
started
a
school
not
even
a
sunday
school
he
did
even
keep
his
own
boys
at
home
and
the
world
got
worse
every
day
and
finally
he
concluded
to
drown
them
yet
that
same
god
has
the
impudence
to
tell
me
how
to
raise
my
own
children
what
would
you
think
of
a
neighbor
who
had
just
killed
his
babes
giving
you
his
views
on
domestic
economy
god
found
that
he
could
do
nothing
with
them
and
he
said
i
will
drown
them
all
except
a
few
and
he
picked
out
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
noah
that
had
been
a
bachelor
for
five
hundred
years
if
i
had
to
drown
anybody
i
would
have
drowned
him
i
believe
that
noah
had
then
been
married
something
like
one
hundred
years
god
told
him
to
build
a
boat
and
he
built
one
five
hundred
feet
long
eighty
or
ninety
feet
broad
and
feet
high
with
one
door
shutting
on
the
outside
and
one
window
inches
square
if
noah
had
any
hobby
in
the
world
it
was
ventilation
then
into
this
ark
he
put
a
certain
number
of
all
the
animals
in
the
world
naturalists
have
ascertained
that
at
that
time
there
were
at
least
eleven
hundred
thousand
insects
necessary
to
go
into
the
ark
about
forty
thousand
mammalia
sixteen
hundred
reptiles
to
say
nothing
of
the
mastodon
the
elephant
and
the
animalcule
of
which
thousands
live
upon
a
single
leaf
and
which
can
not
be
seen
by
the
naked
eye
noah
had
no
microscope
and
yet
he
had
pick
them
out
by
pairs
you
have
no
idea
the
trouble
that
man
had
some
say
that
the
flood
was
not
universal
that
it
was
partial
why
then
did
god
say
i
will
destroy
every
living
thing
beneath
the
heavens
if
it
was
partial
why
did
noah
save
the
birds
an
ordinary
bird
tending
strictly
to
business
can
beat
a
partial
flood
why
did
he
put
the
birds
in
there
the
eagles
the
vultures
the
condors
if
it
was
only
a
partial
flood
and
how
did
he
get
them
in
there
were
they
inspired
to
go
there
or
did
he
drive
them
up
did
the
polar
bear
leave
his
home
of
ice
and
start
for
the
tropic
inquiring
for
noah
or
could
the
kangaroo
come
from
australia
unless
he
was
inspired
or
somebody
was
behind
him
then
there
are
animals
on
this
hemisphere
not
on
that
how
did
he
get
them
across
and
there
are
some
animals
which
would
be
very
unpleasant
in
an
ark
unless
the
ventilation
was
very
perfect
when
he
got
the
animals
in
the
ark
god
shut
the
door
and
noah
pulled
down
the
window
and
then
it
began
to
rain
and
it
kept
on
raining
until
the
water
went
twenty
nine
feet
over
the
highest
mountain
chimborazo
then
as
now
lifted
its
head
above
the
clouds
and
then
as
now
there
sat
the
condor
and
yet
the
waters
rose
and
rose
over
every
mountain
in
the
world
feet
above
the
highest
peaks
covered
with
snow
and
ice
how
deep
were
these
waters
about
five
and
a
half
miles
how
long
did
it
rain
forty
days
how
much
did
it
have
to
rain
a
day
about
eight
hundred
feet
how
is
that
for
dampness
no
wonder
they
said
the
windows
of
the
heavens
were
open
if
i
had
been
there
i
would
have
said
the
whole
side
of
the
house
was
out
how
long
were
they
in
this
ark
a
year
and
ten
days
floating
around
with
no
rudder
no
sail
nobody
on
the
outside
at
all
the
window
was
shut
and
there
was
no
door
except
the
one
that
shut
on
the
outside
who
ran
this
ark
who
took
care
of
it
finally
it
came
down
on
mount
ararat
a
peak
seventeen
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
with
about
three
thousand
feet
of
snow
and
it
stopped
there
simply
to
give
the
animals
from
the
tropics
a
chance
then
noah
opened
the
window
and
got
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
let
out
all
the
animals
and
then
noah
took
a
drink
and
god
made
a
bargain
with
him
that
he
would
not
drown
us
any
more
and
he
put
a
rainbow
in
the
clouds
and
said
when
i
see
that
i
will
recollect
that
i
have
promised
not
to
drown
you
because
if
it
was
not
for
that
he
is
apt
to
drown
us
at
any
moment
now
can
anybody
believe
that
that
is
the
origin
of
the
rainbow
are
you
not
all
familiar
with
the
natural
causes
which
bring
those
beautiful
arches
before
our
eyes
then
the
people
started
out
again
and
they
were
as
bad
as
before
here
let
me
ask
why
god
did
not
make
noah
in
the
first
place
he
knew
he
would
have
to
drown
adam
and
eve
and
all
his
family
then
another
thing
why
did
he
want
to
drown
the
animals
what
had
they
done
what
crime
had
they
committed
it
is
very
hard
to
answer
these
questions
that
is
for
a
man
who
has
only
been
born
once
after
a
while
they
tried
to
build
a
tower
to
get
into
heaven
and
the
gods
heard
about
it
and
said
let
go
down
and
see
what
man
is
up
to
they
came
and
found
things
a
great
deal
worse
than
they
thought
and
thereupon
he
confounded
the
language
to
prevent
them
succeeding
so
that
the
fellow
up
above
could
not
shout
down
mortar
or
brick
to
the
one
below
and
they
had
to
give
it
up
is
it
possible
that
any
one
believes
that
that
is
the
reason
why
we
have
the
variety
of
languages
in
the
world
do
you
know
that
language
is
born
of
human
experience
and
is
a
physical
science
do
you
know
that
every
word
has
been
suggested
in
some
way
by
the
feelings
or
observations
of
man
that
there
are
words
as
tender
as
the
dawn
as
serene
as
the
stars
and
others
as
wild
as
the
beasts
do
you
know
that
language
is
dying
and
being
born
continually
that
every
language
has
its
cemetery
and
its
cradle
its
bud
and
blossom
and
withered
leaf
man
has
loved
enjoyed
and
suffered
and
language
is
simply
the
expression
he
gives
those
experiences
then
the
world
began
to
divide
and
the
jewish
nation
was
started
now
i
want
to
say
that
at
one
time
your
ancestors
like
mine
were
barbarians
if
the
jewish
people
had
to
write
these
books
now
they
would
be
civilized
books
and
i
do
not
hold
them
responsible
for
what
their
ancestors
did
we
find
the
jewish
people
first
in
canaan
and
there
were
seventy
of
them
counting
joseph
and
his
children
already
in
egypt
they
lived
two
hundred
and
fifteen
years
and
they
then
went
down
into
egypt
and
stayed
there
two
hundred
and
fifteen
years
they
were
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
in
canaan
and
egypt
how
many
did
they
have
when
they
went
to
egypt
seventy
how
many
were
they
at
the
end
of
two
hundred
and
fifteen
years
three
millions
that
is
a
good
many
we
had
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
in
this
country
three
millions
of
people
since
that
time
there
have
been
four
doubles
until
we
have
millions
today
how
many
would
the
jews
number
at
the
same
ratio
in
two
hundred
and
fifteen
years
call
it
eight
doubles
and
we
have
forty
thousand
but
instead
of
forty
thousand
they
had
three
millions
how
do
i
know
they
had
three
millions
because
they
had
six
hundred
thousand
men
of
war
for
every
honest
voter
in
the
state
of
illinois
there
will
be
five
other
people
and
there
are
always
more
voters
than
men
of
war
they
must
have
had
at
the
lowest
possible
estimate
three
millions
of
people
is
that
true
is
there
a
minister
in
the
city
of
chicago
that
will
testify
to
his
own
idiocy
by
claiming
that
they
could
have
increased
to
three
millions
by
that
time
if
there
is
let
him
say
so
do
not
let
him
talk
about
the
civilizing
influence
of
a
lie
when
they
got
into
the
desert
they
took
a
census
to
see
how
man
children
there
were
they
found
they
had
two
hundred
and
males
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
there
was
about
the
same
number
of
girls
or
thousand
children
there
must
have
been
about
as
many
mothers
as
children
dividing
three
millions
by
thousand
mothers
and
you
will
find
that
the
women
in
israel
had
to
have
on
the
average
children
apiece
some
stories
are
too
thin
this
is
too
thick
now
we
know
that
among
three
million
people
there
will
be
about
three
hundred
births
a
day
and
according
to
the
old
testament
whenever
a
child
was
born
the
mother
had
to
make
a
sacrifice
a
for
the
crime
of
having
been
a
mother
if
there
is
in
this
universe
anything
that
is
infinitely
pure
it
is
a
mother
with
her
child
in
her
arms
every
woman
had
to
have
a
sacrifice
of
a
couple
of
pigeons
and
the
priests
had
to
eat
those
pigeons
in
the
most
holy
place
at
that
time
there
were
at
least
three
hundred
births
a
day
and
the
priests
had
to
cook
and
eat
these
pigeons
in
the
most
holy
place
and
at
that
time
there
were
only
three
priests
two
hundred
birds
apiece
per
day
i
look
upon
them
as
the
champion
of
the
world
then
where
were
these
jews
they
were
upon
the
desert
of
sinai
and
sahara
compared
to
that
is
a
garden
imagine
an
ocean
of
lava
torn
by
storm
and
vexed
by
tempest
suddenly
gazed
at
by
a
gorgon
and
changed
to
stone
such
was
the
desert
of
sinai
the
whole
supplies
of
the
world
could
not
maintain
three
millions
of
people
on
the
desert
of
sinai
for
forty
years
it
would
cost
one
hundred
thousand
millions
of
dollars
and
would
bankrupt
christendom
and
yet
there
they
were
with
flocks
and
herds
so
many
that
they
sacrificed
over
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
lambs
at
one
time
it
would
require
millions
of
acres
to
support
these
flocks
and
yet
there
was
no
blade
of
grass
and
there
is
no
account
of
it
raining
baled
hay
they
sacrificed
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
lambs
and
the
blood
had
all
to
be
sprinkled
on
the
altar
within
two
hours
and
there
were
only
three
priests
they
would
have
to
sprinkle
the
blood
of
twelve
hundred
and
fifty
lambs
per
minute
then
all
the
people
gathered
in
front
of
the
tabernacle
eighteen
feet
deep
three
millions
of
people
would
make
a
column
six
miles
long
some
reverend
gentlemen
say
they
were
ninety
feet
deep
well
that
would
make
a
column
of
over
a
mile
where
were
these
people
going
they
were
going
to
the
holy
land
how
large
was
it
twelve
thousand
square
miles
the
size
of
illinois
a
frightful
country
covered
with
rocks
and
desolation
there
never
was
a
land
agent
in
the
city
of
chicago
that
would
not
have
blushed
with
shame
to
have
described
that
land
as
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
do
you
believe
that
god
almighty
ever
went
into
partnership
with
hornets
is
it
necessary
unto
salvation
god
said
to
the
jews
i
will
send
hornets
before
you
to
drive
out
the
canaanites
how
would
a
hornet
know
a
canaanite
is
it
possible
that
god
inspired
the
hornets
that
he
granted
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
to
hornets
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
nothing
in
the
world
would
be
better
calculated
to
make
a
man
leave
his
native
country
than
a
few
hornets
attending
strictly
to
business
god
said
kill
the
canaanites
slowly
why
lest
the
beasts
of
the
field
increase
upon
you
how
many
jews
were
there
three
millions
going
to
a
country
how
large
twelve
thousand
square
miles
but
were
there
nations
already
in
this
holy
land
yes
there
were
seven
nations
mightier
than
the
jews
say
there
would
be
millions
when
they
got
there
or
millions
with
themselves
yet
they
were
told
to
kill
them
slowly
lest
the
beasts
of
the
field
increase
upon
them
is
there
a
man
in
chicago
that
believes
that
then
what
does
he
teach
it
to
little
children
for
let
him
tell
the
truth
so
the
same
god
went
into
partnership
with
snakes
the
children
of
israel
lived
on
manna
one
account
says
all
the
time
and
another
only
a
little
while
that
is
the
reason
there
is
a
chance
for
commentaries
and
you
can
exercise
faith
if
the
book
was
reasonable
everybody
could
get
to
heaven
in
a
moment
but
whenever
it
looks
as
if
it
could
not
be
that
way
and
you
believe
you
are
almost
a
saint
and
when
you
know
it
is
not
that
way
and
believe
you
are
a
saint
he
fed
them
on
manna
now
manna
is
very
peculiar
stuff
it
would
melt
in
the
sun
and
yet
they
used
to
cook
it
by
seething
and
baking
i
would
as
soon
think
of
frying
snow
and
boiling
icicles
but
this
manna
had
other
peculiar
qualities
it
shrank
to
an
omer
no
matter
how
much
they
gathered
and
swelled
up
to
an
omer
no
matter
how
little
they
gathered
what
a
magnificent
thing
manna
would
be
for
the
currency
shrinking
and
swelling
according
to
the
volume
of
business
there
was
not
a
change
in
the
bill
of
fare
for
forty
years
and
they
knew
that
god
could
just
as
well
give
them
three
square
meals
a
day
they
remembered
about
the
cucumbers
and
the
melons
and
the
leeks
and
the
onions
of
egypt
and
they
said
our
souls
abhorreth
this
light
bread
then
this
god
got
mad
you
know
cooks
are
always
touchy
and
thereupon
he
sent
snakes
to
bite
the
men
women
and
children
he
also
sent
them
quails
in
wrath
and
anger
and
while
they
had
the
flesh
between
their
teeth
he
struck
thousands
of
them
dead
he
always
acted
in
that
way
all
of
a
sudden
people
had
no
chance
to
explain
no
chance
to
move
for
a
new
trial
nothing
i
want
to
know
if
it
is
reasonable
he
should
kill
people
for
asking
for
one
change
of
diet
in
forty
years
suppose
you
had
been
boarding
with
an
old
lady
for
forty
years
and
she
never
had
a
solitary
thing
on
her
table
but
hash
and
one
morning
you
said
my
soul
abhorreth
hash
what
would
you
say
if
she
let
a
basketful
of
rattlesnakes
upon
you
now
is
it
possible
for
people
to
believe
this
the
bible
says
their
clothes
did
not
wax
old
they
did
not
get
shiny
at
the
knees
or
elbows
and
their
shoes
did
not
wear
out
they
grew
right
along
with
them
the
little
boy
starting
out
with
his
first
pants
grew
up
and
his
pants
grew
with
him
some
commentators
have
insisted
that
angels
attended
to
their
wardrobes
i
never
could
believe
it
just
think
of
one
angel
hunting
another
and
saying
there
goes
another
button
i
can
not
believe
it
there
must
be
a
mistake
somewhere
or
somehow
do
you
believe
the
real
god
if
there
is
one
ever
killed
a
man
for
making
and
yet
you
find
in
the
pentateuch
that
god
gave
moses
a
recipe
for
making
to
grease
aaron
beard
and
said
if
anybody
made
the
same
he
should
be
killed
and
he
gave
him
a
formula
for
making
ointment
and
he
said
if
anybody
made
ointment
like
that
he
should
be
killed
i
think
that
is
carrying
to
excess
there
must
be
some
mistake
about
it
i
can
not
imagine
the
infinite
creator
of
all
the
shining
worlds
giving
a
recipe
for
do
you
believe
that
the
real
god
came
down
to
mount
sinai
with
a
lot
of
patterns
for
making
a
for
tongs
for
snuffers
and
such
things
do
you
believe
that
god
came
down
on
that
mountain
and
told
moses
how
to
cut
a
coat
and
how
it
should
be
trimmed
what
would
an
infinite
god
care
on
which
side
he
cut
the
breast
what
color
the
fringe
was
or
how
the
buttons
were
placed
do
you
believe
god
told
moses
to
make
curtains
of
fine
linen
where
did
they
get
their
flax
in
the
desert
how
did
they
weave
it
did
he
tell
him
to
make
things
of
gold
silver
and
precious
stones
when
they
had
them
is
it
possible
that
god
told
them
not
to
eat
any
fruit
until
after
the
fourth
year
of
planting
the
trees
you
see
all
these
things
were
written
hundreds
of
years
afterwards
and
the
priests
in
order
to
collect
the
tithes
dated
the
laws
back
they
did
not
say
this
is
our
law
but
thus
said
god
to
moses
in
the
wilderness
now
can
you
believe
that
imagine
a
scene
the
eternal
god
tells
moses
here
is
the
way
i
want
you
to
consecrate
my
priests
catch
a
sheep
and
cut
his
throat
i
never
could
understand
why
god
wanted
a
sheep
killed
just
because
a
man
had
done
a
mean
trick
perhaps
it
was
because
his
priests
were
fond
of
mutton
he
tells
moses
further
to
take
some
of
the
blood
and
put
it
on
his
right
thumb
a
little
on
his
right
ear
and
a
little
on
his
right
big
toe
do
you
believe
god
ever
gave
such
instructions
for
the
consecration
of
his
priests
if
you
should
see
the
south
sea
islanders
going
through
such
a
performance
you
could
not
keep
your
face
straight
and
will
you
tell
me
that
it
had
to
be
done
in
order
to
consecrate
a
man
to
the
service
of
the
infinite
god
supposing
the
blood
got
on
the
left
toe
then
we
find
in
this
book
how
god
went
to
work
to
make
the
egyptians
let
the
israelites
go
suppose
we
wish
to
make
a
treaty
with
the
mikado
of
japan
and
hayes
sent
a
commissioner
there
and
suppose
he
should
employ
hermann
the
wonderful
german
to
go
along
with
him
and
when
they
came
in
the
presence
of
the
mikado
herman
threw
down
an
umbrella
which
changed
into
a
turtle
and
the
commissioner
said
this
is
my
certificate
you
would
say
the
country
is
disgraced
you
would
say
the
president
of
a
republic
like
this
disgraces
himself
with
jugglery
yet
we
are
told
god
sent
moses
and
aaron
before
pharaoh
and
when
they
got
there
moses
threw
down
a
stick
which
turned
into
a
snake
that
god
is
a
juggler
he
is
the
infinite
prestidigitator
is
that
possible
was
that
really
a
snake
or
was
it
the
appearance
of
a
snake
if
it
was
the
appearance
of
a
snake
it
was
a
fraud
then
the
necromancers
of
egypt
were
sent
for
and
they
threw
down
sticks
which
turned
into
snakes
but
those
were
not
so
large
as
moses
snakes
which
swallowed
them
i
maintain
that
it
is
just
as
hard
to
make
small
snakes
as
it
is
to
make
large
ones
the
only
difference
is
that
to
make
large
snakes
either
larger
sticks
or
more
practice
is
required
do
you
believe
that
god
rained
hail
on
innocent
cattle
killing
them
in
the
highways
and
in
the
field
why
should
he
inflict
punishment
on
cattle
for
something
their
owners
had
done
i
could
never
have
any
respect
for
a
god
that
would
so
inflict
pain
upon
a
brute
beast
simply
on
account
of
the
crime
of
its
owner
is
it
possible
that
god
worked
miracles
to
convince
pharaoh
that
slavery
was
wrong
why
did
he
not
tell
pharaoh
that
any
nation
founded
on
slavery
could
not
stand
why
did
he
not
tell
him
your
government
is
founded
on
slavery
and
it
will
go
down
and
the
sands
of
the
desert
will
hide
from
the
view
of
man
your
temples
your
altars
and
your
fanes
why
did
he
not
speak
about
the
infamy
of
slavery
because
he
believed
in
the
infamy
of
slavery
himself
can
we
believe
that
god
will
allow
a
man
to
give
his
wife
the
right
of
divorcement
and
make
the
mother
of
his
children
a
wanderer
and
a
vagrant
there
is
not
one
word
about
woman
in
the
old
testament
except
the
word
of
shame
and
humiliation
the
god
of
the
bible
does
not
think
woman
is
as
good
as
man
she
never
was
worth
mentioning
it
did
not
take
the
pains
to
recount
the
death
of
the
mother
of
us
all
i
have
no
respect
for
any
book
that
does
not
treat
woman
as
the
equal
of
man
and
if
there
is
any
god
in
this
universe
who
thinks
more
of
me
than
he
thinks
of
my
wife
he
is
not
well
acquainted
with
both
of
us
and
yet
they
say
that
that
was
done
on
account
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
that
was
done
in
a
community
where
the
law
was
so
fierce
that
it
stoned
a
man
to
death
for
picking
up
sticks
on
sunday
would
it
not
have
been
better
to
stone
to
death
every
man
who
abused
his
wife
and
allowed
them
to
pick
up
sticks
on
account
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
if
god
wanted
to
take
those
jews
from
egypt
to
the
land
of
canaan
why
did
he
do
it
instantly
if
he
was
going
to
do
a
miracle
why
did
he
do
one
worth
talking
about
after
god
had
killed
all
the
in
egypt
after
he
had
killed
all
the
cattle
still
egypt
could
raise
an
army
that
could
put
to
flight
six
hundred
thousand
men
and
because
this
god
overwhelmed
the
egyptian
army
he
bragged
about
it
for
a
thousand
years
repeatedly
calling
the
attention
of
the
jews
to
the
fact
that
he
overthrew
pharaoh
and
his
hosts
did
he
help
much
with
their
thousand
men
we
find
by
the
records
of
the
day
that
the
egyptian
standing
army
at
that
time
was
never
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
men
must
we
believe
all
these
stories
in
order
to
get
to
heaven
when
we
die
must
we
judge
of
a
man
character
by
the
number
of
stories
he
believes
are
we
to
get
to
heaven
by
creed
or
by
deed
that
is
the
question
shall
we
reason
or
shall
we
simply
believe
ah
but
they
say
the
bible
is
not
inspired
about
those
little
things
the
bible
says
the
rabbit
and
the
hare
chew
the
cud
but
they
do
not
they
have
a
tremulous
motion
of
the
lip
but
the
being
that
made
them
says
they
chew
the
cud
the
bible
therefore
is
not
inspired
in
natural
history
is
it
inspired
in
its
astrology
no
well
what
is
it
inspired
in
in
its
law
thousands
of
people
say
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
ten
commandments
we
would
not
have
known
any
better
than
to
rob
and
steal
suppose
a
man
planted
an
acre
of
potatoes
hoed
them
all
summer
and
dug
them
in
the
fall
and
suppose
a
man
had
sat
upon
the
fence
all
the
time
and
watched
him
do
you
believe
it
would
be
necessary
for
that
man
to
read
the
ten
commandments
to
find
out
who
in
his
judgment
had
a
right
to
take
those
potatoes
all
laws
against
larceny
have
been
made
by
industry
to
protect
the
fruits
of
its
labor
why
is
there
a
law
against
murder
simply
because
a
large
majority
of
people
object
to
being
murdered
that
is
all
and
all
these
laws
were
in
force
thousands
of
years
before
that
time
one
of
the
commandments
said
they
should
not
make
any
graven
images
and
that
was
the
death
of
art
in
palestine
no
sculptor
has
ever
enriched
stone
with
the
divine
forms
of
beauty
in
that
country
and
any
commandment
that
is
the
death
of
art
is
not
a
good
commandment
but
they
say
the
bible
is
morally
inspired
and
they
tell
me
there
is
no
civilization
without
this
bible
then
god
knows
that
just
as
well
as
you
do
god
always
knew
it
and
if
you
ca
civilize
a
nation
without
a
bible
why
did
god
give
every
nation
just
one
bible
to
start
with
why
did
god
allow
hundreds
of
thousands
and
billions
of
billions
to
go
down
to
hell
just
for
the
lack
of
a
bible
they
say
that
it
is
morally
inspired
well
let
us
examine
it
i
want
to
be
fair
about
this
thing
because
i
am
willing
to
stake
my
salvation
or
damnation
upon
this
question
whether
the
bible
is
true
or
not
i
say
it
is
not
and
upon
that
i
am
willing
to
wager
my
soul
is
there
a
woman
here
who
believes
in
the
institution
of
polygamy
is
there
a
man
here
who
believes
in
that
infamy
you
say
no
we
do
not
then
you
are
better
than
your
god
was
four
thousand
years
ago
four
thousand
years
ago
he
believed
in
it
taught
it
and
upheld
it
i
pronounce
it
and
denounce
it
the
infamy
of
infamies
it
robs
our
language
of
every
sweet
and
tender
word
in
it
it
takes
the
away
forever
it
takes
the
meaning
out
of
the
words
father
mother
sister
brother
and
turns
the
temple
of
love
into
a
vile
den
where
crawl
the
slimy
snakes
of
lust
and
hatred
i
was
in
utah
a
little
while
ago
and
was
on
the
mountain
where
god
used
to
talk
to
brigham
young
he
never
said
anything
to
me
i
said
that
it
was
just
as
reasonable
that
god
in
the
nineteenth
century
should
talk
to
a
polygamist
in
utah
as
it
was
that
four
thousand
years
ago
on
mount
sinai
he
talked
to
moses
upon
that
hellish
and
damnable
question
i
have
no
love
for
any
god
who
believes
in
polygamy
there
is
no
heaven
on
this
earth
save
where
the
one
woman
loves
the
one
man
and
the
one
man
loves
the
one
woman
i
guess
it
is
not
inspired
on
the
polygamy
question
may
be
it
is
inspired
about
religious
liberty
god
says
if
anybody
differs
with
you
about
religion
kill
him
he
told
his
peculiar
people
if
any
one
teaches
a
different
religion
kill
him
he
did
not
say
try
and
convince
him
that
he
is
wrong
but
kill
him
he
did
not
say
i
am
in
the
miracle
business
and
i
will
convince
him
but
kill
him
he
said
to
every
husband
if
your
wife
that
you
love
as
you
love
your
own
soul
says
us
go
and
worship
other
gods
then
hand
shall
be
first
upon
her
and
she
shall
be
stoned
with
stones
until
she
dies
well
now
i
hate
a
god
of
that
kind
and
i
can
not
think
of
being
nearer
heaven
than
to
be
away
from
him
a
god
tells
a
man
to
kill
his
wife
simply
because
she
differs
with
him
on
religion
if
the
real
god
were
to
tell
me
to
kill
my
wife
i
would
not
do
it
if
you
had
lived
in
palestine
at
that
time
and
your
wife
the
mother
of
your
children
had
woke
up
at
night
and
said
i
am
tired
of
jehovah
he
is
always
turning
up
that
he
is
always
telling
about
whipping
the
egyptians
he
is
always
killing
somebody
i
am
tired
of
him
let
us
worship
the
sun
the
sun
has
clothed
the
world
in
beauty
it
has
covered
the
earth
with
green
and
flowers
by
its
divine
light
i
first
saw
your
face
its
light
has
enabled
me
to
look
into
the
eyes
of
my
beautiful
babe
let
us
worship
the
sun
father
and
mother
of
light
and
love
and
joy
then
what
would
it
be
your
duty
to
do
kill
her
do
you
believe
a
real
god
ever
did
that
your
hand
should
be
first
upon
her
and
when
you
took
up
some
ragged
rock
and
hurled
it
against
the
white
bosom
filled
with
love
for
you
and
saw
running
away
the
red
current
of
her
sweet
life
then
you
would
look
up
to
heaven
and
receive
the
congratulations
of
the
infinite
fiend
whose
commandments
you
had
to
obey
i
guess
the
bible
was
not
inspired
about
religious
liberty
let
me
ask
you
right
here
suppose
as
a
matter
of
fact
god
gave
those
laws
to
the
jews
and
told
them
whenever
a
man
preaches
a
different
religion
kill
him
and
suppose
that
afterwards
the
same
god
took
upon
himself
flesh
and
came
to
the
world
and
taught
and
preached
a
different
religion
and
the
jews
crucified
him
did
he
not
reap
exactly
what
he
sowed
may
be
this
book
is
inspired
about
war
god
told
the
israelites
to
overrun
that
country
and
kill
every
man
woman
and
child
for
defending
their
native
land
kill
the
old
men
yes
kill
the
women
certainly
and
the
little
dimpled
babes
in
the
cradle
that
smile
and
coo
in
the
face
of
murder
dash
out
their
brains
that
is
the
will
of
god
will
you
tell
me
that
any
god
ever
commanded
such
infamy
kill
the
men
and
the
women
and
the
young
men
and
the
babes
what
shall
we
do
with
the
maidens
give
them
to
the
rabble
murderers
do
you
believe
that
god
ever
allowed
the
roses
of
love
and
the
violets
of
modesty
that
shed
their
perfume
in
the
heart
of
a
maiden
to
be
trampled
beneath
the
brutal
feet
of
lust
if
there
is
any
god
i
pray
him
to
write
in
the
book
of
eternal
remembrance
opposite
to
my
name
that
i
denied
that
lie
whenever
a
woman
reads
a
bible
and
comes
to
that
passage
she
ought
to
throw
the
book
from
her
in
contempt
and
scorn
do
you
tell
me
that
any
decent
god
would
do
that
what
would
the
devil
have
done
under
the
same
circumstances
just
think
of
it
and
yet
that
is
the
god
that
we
want
to
get
into
the
constitution
that
is
the
god
we
teach
our
children
about
so
that
they
will
be
sweet
and
tender
amiable
and
kind
that
monster
that
fiend
i
guess
the
bible
is
not
inspired
about
religious
liberty
nor
about
war
then
if
it
is
not
inspired
about
these
things
may
be
it
is
inspired
about
slavery
god
tells
the
jews
to
buy
up
the
children
of
the
heathen
round
about
and
they
should
be
servants
for
them
what
is
a
servant
if
they
struck
a
servant
and
he
died
immediately
punishment
was
to
follow
but
if
the
injured
man
should
linger
a
while
there
was
no
punishment
because
the
servant
represented
their
money
do
you
believe
that
it
is
right
that
god
made
one
man
to
work
for
another
and
to
receive
pay
in
rations
do
you
believe
god
said
that
a
whip
on
the
naked
back
was
the
legal
tender
for
labor
performed
is
it
possible
that
the
real
god
ever
gave
such
infamous
laws
what
more
does
he
say
when
the
time
of
a
married
slave
expired
he
could
not
take
his
wife
and
children
with
him
then
if
the
slave
did
not
wish
to
desert
his
family
he
had
his
ears
pierced
with
an
awl
and
became
his
master
property
forever
do
you
believe
that
god
ever
turned
the
dimpled
cheeks
of
little
children
into
iron
chains
to
hold
a
man
in
slavery
do
you
know
that
a
god
like
that
would
not
make
a
respectable
devil
i
want
none
of
his
mercy
i
want
no
part
and
no
lot
in
the
heaven
of
such
a
god
i
will
go
to
perdition
where
there
is
human
sympathy
the
only
voice
we
have
ever
had
from
either
of
those
other
worlds
came
from
hell
there
was
a
rich
man
who
prayed
his
brothers
to
attend
to
lazarus
so
that
they
might
not
come
to
this
place
that
is
the
only
instance
so
far
as
we
know
of
souls
across
the
river
having
any
sympathy
and
i
would
rather
be
in
hell
asking
for
water
than
in
heaven
denying
that
petition
well
what
is
this
book
inspired
about
where
does
the
inspiration
come
from
why
was
it
that
so
many
animals
were
killed
it
was
simply
to
make
atonement
for
man
that
is
all
they
killed
something
that
had
not
committed
a
crime
in
order
that
the
one
who
had
committed
the
crime
might
be
acquitted
based
upon
that
idea
is
the
atonement
of
the
christian
religion
that
is
the
reason
i
attack
this
book
because
it
is
the
basis
of
another
infamy
viz
that
one
man
can
be
good
for
another
or
that
one
man
can
sin
for
another
i
deny
it
you
have
got
to
be
good
for
yourself
you
have
got
to
sin
for
yourself
the
trouble
about
the
atonement
is
that
it
saves
the
wrong
man
for
instance
i
kill
some
one
he
is
a
good
man
he
loves
his
wife
and
children
and
tries
to
make
them
happy
but
he
is
not
a
christian
and
he
goes
to
hell
just
as
soon
as
i
am
convicted
and
can
not
get
a
pardon
i
get
religion
and
i
go
to
heaven
the
hand
of
mercy
can
not
reach
down
through
the
shadows
of
hell
to
my
victim
there
is
no
atonement
for
the
saint
only
for
the
sinner
and
the
criminal
the
atonement
saves
the
wrong
man
i
have
said
that
i
would
never
make
a
lecture
at
all
without
attacking
this
doctrine
i
did
not
care
what
i
started
out
on
i
was
always
going
to
attack
this
doctrine
and
in
my
conclusion
i
want
to
draw
you
a
few
pictures
of
the
christian
heaven
but
before
i
do
that
i
want
to
say
the
rest
i
have
to
say
about
moses
i
want
you
to
understand
that
the
bible
was
never
printed
until
i
want
you
to
know
that
up
to
that
time
it
was
in
manuscript
in
possession
of
those
who
could
change
it
if
they
wished
and
they
did
change
it
because
no
two
ever
agreed
much
of
it
was
in
the
waste
basket
of
credulity
in
the
open
mouth
of
tradition
and
in
the
dull
ear
of
memory
i
want
you
also
to
know
that
the
jews
themselves
never
agreed
as
to
what
books
were
inspired
and
that
there
were
a
lot
of
books
written
that
were
not
incorporated
in
the
old
testament
i
want
you
to
know
that
two
or
three
years
before
christ
the
hebrew
manuscript
was
translated
into
greek
and
that
the
original
from
which
the
translation
was
made
has
never
been
seen
since
some
latin
bibles
were
found
in
africa
but
no
two
agreed
and
then
they
translated
the
septuagint
into
the
languages
of
europe
and
no
two
agreed
henry
viii
took
a
little
time
between
murdering
his
wives
to
see
that
the
word
of
god
was
translated
correctly
you
must
recollect
that
we
are
indebted
to
murderers
for
our
bibles
and
our
creeds
constantine
who
helped
on
the
good
work
in
its
early
stage
murdered
his
wife
and
child
mingling
their
blood
with
the
blood
of
the
savior
the
bible
that
henry
viii
got
up
did
not
suit
and
then
his
daughter
the
murderess
of
mary
queen
of
scots
got
up
another
edition
which
also
did
not
suit
and
finally
that
philosophical
idiot
king
james
prepared
the
edition
which
we
now
have
there
are
at
least
one
hundred
thousand
errors
in
the
old
testament
but
everybody
sees
that
it
is
not
enough
to
invalidate
its
claim
to
infallibility
but
these
errors
are
gradually
being
fixed
and
hereafter
the
prophet
will
be
fed
by
arabs
instead
of
ravens
and
samson
three
hundred
foxes
will
be
three
hundred
sheaves
already
bound
which
were
fired
and
thrown
into
the
standing
wheat
i
want
you
all
to
know
that
there
was
no
contemporaneous
literature
at
the
time
the
bible
was
composed
and
that
the
jews
were
infinitely
ignorant
in
their
day
and
generation
that
they
were
isolated
by
bigotry
and
wickedness
from
the
rest
of
the
world
i
want
you
to
know
that
there
are
fourteen
hundred
millions
of
people
in
the
world
and
that
with
all
the
talk
and
work
of
the
societies
only
one
hundred
and
twenty
millions
have
got
bibles
i
want
you
to
understand
that
not
one
person
in
one
hundred
in
this
world
ever
read
the
bible
and
no
two
ever
understood
it
alike
who
did
read
it
and
that
no
one
person
probably
ever
understood
it
aright
i
want
you
to
understand
that
where
this
bible
has
been
man
has
hated
his
brother
there
have
been
dungeons
racks
thumbscrews
and
the
sword
i
want
you
to
know
that
the
cross
has
been
in
partnership
with
the
sword
and
that
the
religion
of
jesus
christ
was
established
by
murderers
tyrants
and
hypocrites
i
want
you
to
know
that
the
church
carried
the
black
flag
then
talk
about
the
civilizing
influence
of
this
religion
now
i
want
to
give
an
idea
or
two
in
regard
to
the
christian
heaven
of
all
the
selfish
things
in
this
world
it
is
one
man
wanting
to
get
to
heaven
caring
nothing
what
becomes
of
the
rest
of
mankind
if
i
can
only
get
my
little
soul
in
i
have
always
noticed
that
the
people
who
have
the
smallest
souls
make
the
most
fuss
about
getting
them
saved
here
is
what
we
are
taught
by
the
church
today
we
are
taught
by
it
that
fathers
and
mothers
brothers
and
sisters
can
all
be
happy
in
heaven
no
matter
who
may
be
in
hell
that
the
husband
can
be
happy
there
with
the
wife
that
would
have
died
for
him
at
any
moment
of
his
life
in
hell
but
they
say
we
do
believe
in
fire
what
we
believe
in
now
is
remorse
what
will
you
have
remorse
for
for
the
mean
things
you
have
done
when
you
are
in
hell
will
you
have
any
remorse
for
the
mean
things
you
have
done
when
you
are
in
heaven
or
will
you
be
so
good
then
that
you
wo
care
how
you
used
to
be
you
see
what
an
infinitely
mean
belief
that
is
i
tell
you
today
that
no
matter
in
what
heaven
you
may
be
no
matter
in
what
star
you
are
spending
the
summer
if
you
meet
another
man
whom
you
have
wronged
you
will
drop
a
little
behind
in
the
tune
and
no
matter
in
what
part
of
hell
you
are
and
you
meet
some
one
whom
you
have
succored
whose
nakedness
you
have
clothed
and
whose
famine
you
have
fed
the
fire
will
cool
up
a
little
according
to
this
christian
doctrine
when
you
are
in
heaven
you
wo
care
how
mean
you
were
once
what
must
be
the
social
condition
of
a
gentleman
in
heaven
who
will
admit
that
he
never
would
have
been
there
if
he
had
not
got
scared
what
must
be
the
social
position
of
an
angel
who
will
always
admit
that
if
another
had
not
pitied
him
he
ought
to
have
been
damned
is
it
a
compliment
to
an
infinite
god
to
say
that
every
being
he
ever
made
deserved
to
be
damned
the
minute
he
got
him
done
and
that
he
will
damn
everybody
he
has
not
had
a
chance
to
make
over
is
it
possible
that
somebody
else
can
be
good
for
me
and
that
this
doctrine
of
the
atonement
is
the
only
anchor
for
the
human
soul
for
instance
here
is
a
man
seventy
years
of
age
who
has
been
a
splendid
fellow
and
lived
according
to
the
laws
of
nature
he
has
got
about
him
splendid
children
whom
he
has
loved
and
cared
for
with
all
his
heart
but
he
did
not
happen
to
believe
in
this
bible
he
did
not
believe
in
the
pentateuch
he
did
not
believe
that
because
some
children
made
fun
of
a
gentleman
who
was
short
of
hair
god
sent
two
bears
and
tore
the
little
darlings
to
pieces
he
had
a
tender
heart
and
he
thought
about
the
mothers
who
would
take
the
pieces
the
bloody
fragments
of
the
children
and
press
them
to
their
bosom
in
a
frenzy
of
grief
he
thought
about
their
wails
and
lamentations
and
could
not
believe
that
god
was
such
an
infinite
monster
that
was
all
he
thought
but
he
went
to
hell
then
there
is
another
man
who
made
a
hell
on
earth
for
his
wife
who
had
to
be
taken
to
the
insane
asylum
and
his
children
were
driven
from
home
and
were
wanderers
and
vagrants
in
the
world
but
just
between
the
last
sin
and
the
last
breath
this
fellow
got
religion
and
he
never
did
another
thing
except
to
take
his
medicine
he
never
did
a
solitary
human
being
a
favor
and
he
died
and
went
to
heaven
do
you
think
he
would
be
astonished
to
see
that
other
man
in
hell
and
say
to
himself
is
it
possible
that
such
a
splendid
character
should
bear
such
fruit
and
that
all
my
rascality
at
last
has
brought
me
next
to
god
or
let
us
put
another
case
you
were
once
alone
in
the
desert
no
provisions
no
water
no
hope
just
when
your
life
was
at
its
lowest
ebb
a
man
appeared
gave
you
water
and
food
and
brought
you
safely
out
how
you
would
bless
that
man
time
rolls
on
you
die
and
go
to
heaven
and
one
day
you
see
through
the
black
night
of
hell
the
friend
who
saved
your
life
begging
for
a
drop
of
water
to
cool
his
parched
lips
he
cries
to
you
remember
what
i
did
in
the
desert
give
me
to
drink
how
mean
how
contemptible
you
would
feel
to
see
his
suffering
and
be
unable
to
relieve
him
but
this
is
the
christian
heaven
we
sit
by
the
fireside
and
see
the
flames
and
the
sparks
fly
up
the
chimney
everybody
happy
and
the
cold
wind
and
sleet
are
beating
on
the
window
and
out
on
the
doorstep
is
a
mother
with
a
child
on
her
breast
freezing
how
happy
it
makes
a
fireside
that
beautiful
contrast
and
we
say
god
is
good
and
there
we
sit
and
she
sits
and
moans
not
one
night
but
forever
or
we
are
sitting
at
the
table
with
our
wives
and
children
everybody
eating
happy
and
delighted
and
famine
comes
and
pushes
out
its
shriveled
palms
and
with
hungry
eyes
implores
us
for
a
crust
how
that
would
increase
the
appetite
and
yet
that
is
the
christian
heaven
do
you
see
that
these
infamous
doctrines
petrify
the
human
heart
and
i
would
have
everyone
who
hears
me
swear
that
he
will
never
contribute
another
dollar
to
build
another
church
in
which
is
taught
such
infamous
lies
i
want
everyone
of
you
to
say
that
you
never
will
directly
or
indirectly
give
a
dollar
to
any
man
to
preach
that
falsehood
it
has
done
harm
enough
it
has
covered
the
world
with
blood
it
has
filled
the
asylums
for
the
insane
it
has
cast
a
shadow
in
the
heart
in
the
sunlight
of
every
good
and
tender
man
and
woman
i
say
let
us
rid
the
heavens
of
this
monster
and
write
upon
the
dome
liberty
love
and
law
no
matter
what
may
come
to
me
or
what
may
come
to
you
let
us
do
exactly
what
we
believe
to
be
right
and
let
us
give
the
exact
thought
in
our
brains
rather
than
have
this
christianity
true
i
would
rather
all
the
gods
would
destroy
themselves
this
morning
i
would
rather
the
whole
universe
would
go
to
nothing
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
this
instant
rather
than
have
the
glittering
dome
of
pleasure
reared
on
the
eternal
abyss
of
pain
i
would
see
the
utter
and
eternal
destruction
of
this
universe
i
would
rather
see
the
shining
fabric
of
our
universe
crumble
to
unmeaning
chaos
and
take
itself
where
oblivion
broods
and
memory
forgets
i
would
rather
the
blind
samson
of
some
imprisoned
force
released
by
thoughtless
chance
should
so
rack
and
strain
this
world
that
man
in
stress
and
strain
in
astonishment
and
fear
should
suddenly
fall
back
to
savagery
and
barbarity
i
would
rather
that
this
thrilled
and
thrilling
globe
shorn
of
all
life
should
in
its
cycles
rub
the
wheel
the
parent
star
on
which
the
light
should
fall
as
fruitlessly
as
falls
the
gaze
of
love
on
death
than
to
have
this
infamous
doctrine
of
eternal
punishment
true
rather
than
have
this
infamous
selfishness
of
a
heaven
for
a
few
and
a
hell
for
the
many
established
as
the
word
of
god
one
world
at
a
time
is
my
doctrine
let
us
make
some
one
happy
here
happiness
is
the
interest
that
a
decent
action
draws
and
the
more
decent
actions
you
do
the
larger
your
income
will
be
let
every
man
try
to
make
his
wife
happy
his
children
happy
let
every
man
try
to
make
every
day
a
joy
and
god
can
not
afford
to
damn
such
a
man
i
can
not
help
god
i
can
not
injure
god
i
can
help
people
i
can
injure
people
consequently
humanity
is
the
only
real
religion
i
can
not
better
close
this
lecture
than
by
quoting
four
lines
from
robert
burns
to
make
a
happy
fireside
clime
to
weans
and
wife
that
the
true
pathos
and
sublime
of
human
life
ingersoll

on

and
his
replies
to
prof

and
other
critics
reprinted
from
the
chicago
times
ladies
and
gentlemen
man
advances
just
in
the
proportion
that
he
mingles
his
thoughts
with
his
labor
just
in
the
proportion
that
he
takes
advantage
of
the
forces
of
nature
just
in
proportion
as
he
loses
superstition
and
gains
confidence
in
himself
man
advances
as
he
ceases
to
fear
the
gods
and
learns
to
love
his
it
is
all
in
my
judgment
a
question
of
intellectual
development
tell
me
the
religion
of
any
man
and
i
will
tell
you
the
degree
he
marks
on
the
intellectual
thermometer
of
the
world
it
is
a
simple
question
of
brain
those
among
us
who
are
the
nearest
barbarism
have
a
barbarian
religion
those
who
are
nearest
civilization
have
the
least
superstition
it
is
i
say
a
simple
question
of
brain
and
i
want
in
the
first
place
to
lay
the
foundation
to
prove
that
assertion
a
little
while
ago
i
saw
models
of
nearly
everything
that
man
has
made
i
saw
models
of
all
the
water
craft
from
the
rude
in
which
floated
a
naked
savage
one
of
our
ancestors
a
naked
savage
with
teeth
twice
as
long
as
his
forehead
was
high
with
a
spoonful
of
brains
in
the
back
of
his
orthodox
head
i
saw
models
of
all
the
water
craft
of
the
world
from
that
up
to
a
that
carries
a
hundred
guns
and
miles
of
canvas
from
that
to
the
steamship
that
turns
its
brave
prow
from
the
port
of
new
york
with
a
compass
like
a
conscience
crossing
three
thousand
miles
of
billows
without
missing
a
throb
or
beat
of
its
mighty
iron
heart
from
shore
to
shore
and
i
saw
at
the
same
time
the
paintings
of
the
world
from
the
rude
daub
of
yellow
mud
to
the
landscapes
that
enrich
palaces
and
adorn
houses
of
what
were
once
called
the
common
people
i
saw
also
their
sculpture
from
the
rude
god
with
four
legs
a
half
dozen
arms
several
noses
and
two
or
three
rows
of
ears
and
one
little
contemptible
brainless
head
up
to
the
figures
of
today
to
the
marbles
that
genius
has
clad
in
such
a
personality
that
it
seems
almost
impudent
to
touch
them
without
an
introduction
i
saw
their
books
books
written
upon
the
skins
of
wild
beasts
upon
of
sheep
books
written
upon
leaves
upon
bark
up
to
the
splendid
volumes
that
enrich
the
libraries
of
our
day
when
i
speak
of
libraries
i
think
of
the
remark
of
plato
a
house
that
has
a
library
in
it
has
a
soul
i
saw
at
the
same
time
the
offensive
weapons
that
man
has
made
from
a
club
such
as
was
grasped
by
that
same
savage
when
he
crawled
from
his
den
in
the
ground
and
hunted
a
snake
for
his
dinner
from
that
club
to
the
boomerang
to
the
sword
to
the
to
the
blunderbuss
to
the
flintlock
to
the
caplock
to
the
up
to
a
cannon
cast
by
krupp
capable
of
hurling
a
ball
weighing
two
thousand
pounds
through
eighteen
inches
of
solid
steel
i
saw
too
the
armor
from
the
shell
of
a
turtle
that
one
of
our
brave
ancestors
lashed
upon
his
breast
when
he
went
to
fight
for
his
country
the
skin
of
a
porcupine
dried
with
the
quills
on
which
this
same
savage
pulled
over
his
orthodox
head
up
to
the
shirts
of
mail
that
were
worn
in
the
middle
ages
that
laughed
at
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
defied
the
point
of
the
spear
up
to
a
monitor
clad
in
complete
steel
and
i
say
orthodox
not
only
in
the
matter
of
religion
but
in
everything
whoever
has
quit
growing
he
is
orthodox
whether
in
art
politics
religion
philosophy
no
matter
what
whoever
thinks
he
has
found
it
all
out
he
is
orthodox
orthodoxy
is
that
which
rots
and
heresy
is
that
which
grows
forever
orthodoxy
is
the
night
of
the
past
full
of
the
darkness
of
superstition
and
heresy
is
the
eternal
coming
day
the
light
of
which
strikes
the
grand
foreheads
of
the
intellectual
pioneers
of
the
world
i
saw
their
implements
of
agriculture
from
the
plow
made
of
a
crooked
stick
attached
to
the
horn
of
an
ox
by
some
twisted
straw
with
which
our
ancestors
scraped
the
earth
and
from
that
to
the
agricultural
implements
of
this
generation
that
make
it
possible
for
a
man
to
cultivate
the
soil
without
being
an
ignoramus
in
the
old
time
there
was
but
one
crop
and
when
the
rain
did
not
come
in
answer
to
the
prayer
of
hypocrites
a
famine
came
and
people
fell
upon
their
knees
at
that
time
they
were
full
of
superstition
they
were
frightened
all
the
time
for
fear
that
some
god
would
be
enraged
at
his
poor
hapless
feeble
and
starving
children
but
now
instead
of
depending
upon
one
crop
they
have
several
and
if
there
is
not
rain
enough
for
one
there
may
be
enough
for
another
and
if
the
frosts
kill
all
we
have
railroads
and
steamship
enough
to
bring
what
we
need
from
some
other
part
of
the
world
since
man
has
found
out
something
about
agriculture
the
gods
have
retired
from
the
business
of
producing
famines
i
saw
at
the
same
time
their
musical
instruments
from
the
tomtom
that
is
a
hoop
with
a
couple
of
strings
of
rawhide
drawn
across
it
from
that
up
to
the
instruments
we
have
today
that
make
the
common
air
blossom
with
melody
and
i
said
to
myself
there
is
a
regular
advancement
i
saw
at
the
same
time
a
row
of
human
skulls
from
the
lowest
skull
that
has
been
found
the
neanderthal
skull
skulls
from
central
africa
skulls
from
the
bushmen
of
australia
skulls
from
the
farthest
isles
of
the
pacific
sea
up
to
the
best
skulls
of
the
last
generation
and
i
noticed
that
there
was
the
same
difference
between
those
skulls
that
there
was
between
the
products
of
those
skulls
and
i
said
to
myself
after
all
it
is
a
simple
question
of
intellectual
development
there
was
the
same
difference
between
those
skulls
the
lowest
and
highest
skulls
that
there
was
between
the
and
the
and
the
steamship
between
the
club
and
the
krupp
gun
between
the
yellow
daub
and
the
landscape
between
the
and
an
opera
by
verdi
the
first
and
lowest
skull
in
this
row
was
the
den
in
which
crawled
the
base
and
meaner
instincts
of
mankind
and
the
last
was
a
temple
in
which
dwelt
joy
liberty
and
love
and
i
said
to
myself
it
is
all
a
question
of
intellectual
development
man
has
advanced
just
as
he
has
mingled
his
thought
with
his
labor
as
he
has
grown
he
has
taken
advantage
of
the
forces
of
nature
first
of
the
moving
wind
then
of
the
falling
water
and
finally
of
steam
from
one
step
to
another
he
has
obtained
better
houses
better
clothes
and
better
books
and
he
has
done
it
by
holding
out
every
incentive
to
the
ingenious
to
produce
them
the
world
has
said
give
us
better
clubs
and
guns
and
cannons
with
which
to
kill
our
fellow
christians
and
whoever
will
give
us
better
weapons
and
better
music
and
better
houses
to
live
in
we
will
robe
him
in
wealth
crown
him
in
honor
and
render
his
name
deathless
every
incentive
was
held
out
to
every
human
being
to
improve
these
things
and
that
is
the
reason
we
have
advanced
in
all
mechanical
arts
but
that
gentleman
in
the
dugout
not
only
had
his
ideas
about
politics
mechanics
and
agriculture
he
had
his
ideas
also
about
religion
his
idea
about
politics
was
might
makes
right
it
will
be
thousands
of
years
may
be
before
mankind
will
believe
in
the
saying
that
right
makes
might
he
had
his
religion
that
low
skull
was
a
devil
factory
he
believed
in
hell
and
the
belief
was
a
consolation
to
him
he
could
see
the
waves
of
god
wrath
dashing
against
the
rocks
of
dark
damnation
he
could
see
tossing
in
the
whitecaps
the
faces
of
women
and
stretching
above
the
crests
the
dimpled
hands
of
children
and
he
regarded
these
things
as
the
justice
and
mercy
of
god
and
all
today
who
believe
in
this
eternal
punishment
are
the
barbarians
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
man
believed
in
a
devil
that
had
a
long
tail
terminating
with
a
fiery
dart
that
had
wings
like
a
bat
a
devil
that
had
a
cheerful
habit
of
breathing
brimstone
that
had
a
cloven
foot
such
as
some
orthodox
clergymen
seem
to
think
i
have
and
there
has
not
been
a
patentable
improvement
made
upon
that
devil
in
all
the
years
since
the
moment
you
drive
the
devil
out
of
theology
there
is
nothing
left
worth
speaking
of
the
moment
they
drop
the
devil
away
goes
atonement
the
moment
they
kill
the
devil
their
whole
scheme
of
salvation
has
lost
all
of
its
interest
for
mankind
you
must
keep
the
devil
and
you
must
keep
hell
you
must
keep
the
devil
because
with
no
devil
no
priest
is
necessary
now
all
i
ask
is
this
the
same
privilege
to
improve
upon
his
religion
as
upon
his
and
that
is
what
i
am
going
to
do
the
best
i
can
no
matter
what
church
you
belong
to
or
what
church
belongs
to
us
let
us
be
honor
bright
and
fair
i
want
to
ask
you
suppose
the
king
if
there
was
one
and
the
priest
if
there
was
one
at
that
time
had
told
these
gentlemen
in
the
that
is
the
best
boat
that
can
be
built
by
man
the
pattern
of
that
came
from
on
high
from
the
great
god
of
storm
and
flood
and
any
man
who
says
he
can
improve
it
by
putting
a
stick
in
the
middle
of
it
and
a
rag
on
the
stick
is
an
infidel
and
shall
be
burned
at
the
stake
what
in
your
judgment
honor
bright
would
have
been
the
effect
upon
the
circumnavigation
of
the
globe
suppose
the
king
if
there
was
one
and
the
priest
if
there
was
one
and
i
presume
there
was
a
priest
because
it
was
a
very
ignorant
age
suppose
the
king
and
priest
had
said
the
tomtom
is
the
most
beautiful
instrument
of
music
of
which
any
man
can
conceive
that
is
the
kind
of
music
they
have
in
heaven
an
angel
sitting
upon
the
edge
of
a
glorified
cloud
golden
in
the
setting
sun
playing
upon
that
became
so
enraptured
so
entranced
with
her
own
music
that
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
she
dropped
it
that
is
how
we
obtained
it
and
any
man
who
says
it
can
be
improved
by
putting
a
back
and
front
to
it
and
four
strings
and
a
bridge
and
getting
a
bow
of
hair
with
rosin
is
a
blaspheming
wretch
and
shall
die
the
death
i
ask
you
what
effect
would
that
have
had
upon
music
if
that
course
had
been
pursued
would
the
human
ears
in
your
judgment
ever
have
been
enriched
with
the
divine
symphonies
of
beethoven
suppose
the
king
if
there
was
one
and
the
priest
had
said
that
crooked
stick
is
the
best
plow
that
can
be
invented
the
pattern
of
that
plow
was
given
to
a
pious
farmer
in
an
exceedingly
holy
dream
and
that
twisted
straw
is
the
ne
plus
ultra
of
all
twisted
things
and
any
man
who
says
he
can
make
an
improvement
upon
that
plow
is
an
atheist
what
in
your
judgment
would
have
been
the
effect
upon
the
science
of
agriculture
now
all
i
ask
is
the
same
privilege
to
improve
upon
his
religion
as
upon
his
mechanical
arts
why
do
we
go
back
to
that
period
to
get
the
telegraph
because
they
were
barbarians
and
shall
we
go
to
barbarians
to
get
our
religion
what
is
religion
religion
simply
embraces
the
duty
of
man
to
man
religion
is
simply
the
science
of
human
duty
and
the
duty
of
man
to
man
that
is
what
it
is
it
is
the
highest
science
of
all
and
all
other
sciences
are
as
nothing
except
as
they
contribute
to
the
happiness
of
man
the
science
of
religion
is
the
highest
of
all
embracing
all
others
and
shall
we
go
to
the
barbarians
to
learn
the
science
of
sciences
the
nineteenth
century
knows
more
about
religion
than
all
the
centuries
dead
there
is
more
real
charity
in
the
world
today
than
ever
before
there
is
more
thought
today
than
ever
before
woman
is
glorified
today
as
she
never
was
before
in
the
history
of
the
world
there
are
more
happy
families
now
than
ever
before
more
children
treated
as
though
they
were
tender
blossoms
than
as
though
they
were
brutes
than
in
any
other
time
or
nation
religion
is
simply
the
duty
a
man
owes
to
man
and
when
you
fall
upon
your
knees
and
pray
for
something
you
know
not
of
you
neither
benefit
the
one
you
pray
for
nor
yourself
one
ounce
of
restitution
is
worth
a
million
of
repentances
anywhere
and
a
man
will
get
along
faster
by
helping
himself
a
minute
than
by
praying
ten
years
for
somebody
to
help
him
suppose
you
were
coming
along
the
street
and
found
a
party
of
men
and
women
on
their
knees
praying
to
a
bank
and
you
asked
them
have
any
of
you
borrowed
any
money
of
this
bank
no
but
our
fathers
they
too
prayed
to
this
bank
did
they
ever
get
any
no
not
that
we
ever
heard
of
i
would
tell
them
to
get
up
it
is
easier
to
earn
it
and
it
is
far
more
manly
our
fathers
in
the
good
old
times
and
the
best
that
i
can
say
of
the
good
old
times
is
that
they
are
gone
and
the
best
i
can
say
of
the
good
old
people
that
lived
in
them
is
that
they
are
gone
too
believed
that
you
made
a
man
think
your
way
by
force
well
you
ca
do
it
there
is
a
splendid
something
in
man
that
says
i
wo
i
wo
be
driven
but
our
fathers
thought
men
could
be
driven
they
tried
it
in
the
good
old
times
i
used
to
read
about
the
manner
in
which
the
early
christians
made
converts
how
they
impressed
upon
the
world
the
idea
that
god
loved
them
i
have
read
it
but
it
did
burn
into
my
soul
i
did
think
much
about
it
i
heard
so
much
about
being
fried
forever
in
hell
that
it
did
seem
so
bad
to
burn
a
few
minutes
i
love
liberty
and
i
hate
all
persecutions
in
the
name
of
god
i
never
appreciated
the
infamies
that
have
been
committed
in
the
name
of
religion
until
i
saw
the
iron
arguments
that
christians
used
i
saw
for
instance
the
two
little
innocent
looking
pieces
of
iron
armed
with
some
little
protuberances
on
the
inner
side
to
keep
it
from
slipping
down
and
through
each
end
a
screw
and
when
some
man
had
made
some
trifling
remark
for
instance
that
he
never
believed
that
god
made
a
fish
swallow
a
man
to
keep
him
from
drowning
or
something
like
that
or
for
instance
that
he
did
believe
in
baptism
you
know
that
is
very
wrong
you
can
see
for
yourself
the
justice
of
damning
a
man
if
his
parents
happened
to
baptize
him
in
the
wrong
way
god
can
not
afford
to
break
a
rule
or
two
to
save
all
the
men
in
the
world
i
happened
to
be
in
the
company
of
some
baptist
ministers
once
you
may
wonder
how
i
happened
to
be
in
such
company
as
that
and
one
of
them
asked
me
what
i
thought
about
baptism
well
i
told
them
i
had
thought
much
about
it
that
i
had
never
sat
up
nights
on
that
question
i
said
baptism
with
soap
is
a
good
institution
now
when
some
man
had
said
some
trifling
thing
like
that
they
put
this
on
him
and
in
the
name
of
universal
benevolence
and
for
the
love
of
god
man
has
never
persecuted
man
for
the
love
of
man
man
has
never
persecuted
another
for
the
love
of
charity
it
is
always
for
the
love
of
something
he
calls
god
and
every
man
idea
of
god
is
his
own
idea
if
there
is
an
infinite
god
and
there
may
be
i
do
know
there
may
be
a
million
for
all
i
know
i
hope
there
is
more
than
one
one
seems
so
lonesome
they
kept
turning
this
down
and
when
this
was
done
most
men
would
say
i
will
recant
i
think
i
would
there
is
not
much
of
the
martyr
about
me
i
would
have
told
them
now
you
write
it
down
and
i
will
sign
it
you
may
have
one
god
or
a
million
one
hell
or
a
million
you
stop
that
i
am
tired
do
you
know
sometimes
i
have
thought
that
all
the
hypocrites
in
the
world
are
not
worth
one
drop
of
honest
blood
i
am
sorry
that
any
good
man
ever
died
for
religion
i
would
rather
let
them
advance
a
little
easier
it
is
too
bad
to
see
a
good
man
sacrificed
for
a
lot
of
wild
beasts
and
cattle
but
there
is
now
and
then
a
man
who
would
not
swerve
the
breadth
of
a
hair
there
was
now
and
then
a
sublime
heart
willing
to
die
for
an
intellectual
conviction
and
had
it
not
been
for
these
men
we
would
have
been
wild
beasts
and
savages
today
there
were
some
men
who
would
not
take
it
back
and
had
it
not
been
for
a
few
such
brave
heroic
souls
in
every
age
we
would
have
been
cannibals
with
pictures
of
wild
beasts
tattooed
upon
our
breasts
dancing
around
some
fetish
and
so
they
turned
it
down
to
the
last
thread
of
agony
and
threw
the
victim
into
some
dungeon
where
in
the
throbbing
silence
and
darkness
he
might
suffer
the
agonies
of
the
fabled
damned
this
was
done
in
the
name
of
love
in
the
name
of
mercy
in
the
name
of
the
compassionate
christ
and
the
men
that
did
it
are
the
men
that
made
our
bible
for
us
i
saw
too
at
the
same
time
the
collar
of
torture
imagine
a
circle
of
iron
and
on
the
inside
a
hundred
points
almost
as
sharp
as
needles
this
argument
was
fastened
about
the
throat
of
the
sufferer
then
he
could
not
walk
nor
sit
down
nor
stir
without
the
neck
being
punctured
by
these
points
in
a
little
while
the
throat
would
begin
to
swell
and
suffocation
would
end
the
agonies
of
that
man
this
man
it
may
be
had
committed
the
crime
of
saying
with
tears
upon
his
cheeks
i
do
not
believe
that
god
the
father
of
us
all
will
damn
to
eternal
perdition
any
of
the
children
of
men
and
that
was
done
to
convince
the
world
that
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
died
for
us
that
was
in
order
that
people
might
hear
the
glad
tidings
of
great
joy
to
all
people
i
saw
another
instrument
called
the
scavenger
daughter
imagine
a
pair
of
shears
with
handles
not
only
where
they
now
are
but
at
the
points
as
well
and
just
above
the
pivot
that
unites
the
blades
a
circle
of
iron
in
the
upper
handles
the
hands
would
be
placed
in
the
lower
the
feet
and
through
the
iron
ring
at
the
centre
the
head
of
the
victim
would
be
forced
and
in
that
position
the
man
would
be
thrown
upon
the
earth
and
the
strain
upon
the
muscle
would
produce
such
agony
that
insanity
took
pity
and
this
was
done
to
keep
people
from
going
to
hell
to
convince
that
man
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
his
logic
and
it
was
done
too
by
protestants
protestants
that
persecuted
to
the
extent
of
their
power
and
that
is
as
much
as
catholicism
ever
did
they
would
persecute
now
if
they
had
the
power
there
is
not
a
man
in
this
vast
audience
who
will
say
that
the
church
should
have
temporal
power
there
is
not
one
of
you
but
what
believes
in
the
eternal
divorce
of
church
and
state
is
it
possible
that
the
only
people
who
are
fit
to
go
to
heaven
are
the
only
people
not
fit
to
rule
mankind
i
saw
at
the
same
time
the
rack
this
was
a
box
like
the
bed
of
a
wagon
with
a
windlass
at
each
end
and
ratchets
to
prevent
slipping
over
each
windlass
went
chains
and
when
some
man
had
for
instance
denied
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
a
doctrine
it
is
necessary
to
believe
in
order
to
get
to
heaven
but
thank
the
lord
you
do
have
to
understand
it
this
man
merely
denied
that
three
times
one
was
one
or
maybe
he
denied
that
there
was
ever
any
son
in
the
world
exactly
as
old
as
his
father
or
that
there
ever
was
a
boy
eternally
older
than
his
mother
then
they
put
that
man
on
the
rack
nobody
had
ever
been
persecuted
for
calling
god
bad
it
has
always
been
for
calling
him
good
when
i
stand
here
to
say
that
if
there
is
a
hell
god
is
a
fiend
they
say
that
is
very
bad
they
say
i
am
trying
to
tear
down
the
institutions
of
public
virtue
but
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
there
is
no
reformation
in
fear
you
can
scare
a
man
so
that
he
do
it
sometimes
but
i
will
swear
you
ca
scare
him
so
bad
that
he
wo
want
to
do
it
then
they
put
this
man
on
the
rack
and
priests
began
turning
these
levers
and
kept
turning
until
the
ankles
the
hips
the
shoulders
the
elbows
the
wrists
and
all
the
joints
of
the
victim
were
dislocated
and
he
was
wet
with
agony
and
standing
by
was
a
physician
to
feel
his
pulse
what
for
to
save
his
life
yes
in
mercy
no
but
in
order
that
they
might
have
the
pleasure
of
racking
him
once
more
and
this
was
the
christian
spirit
this
was
done
in
the
name
of
civilization
in
the
name
of
religion
and
all
these
wretches
who
did
it
died
in
peace
there
is
not
an
orthodox
preacher
in
the
city
that
has
not
a
respect
for
every
one
of
them
as
for
instance
for
john
calvin
who
was
a
murderer
and
nothing
but
a
murderer
who
would
have
disgraced
an
ordinary
gallows
by
being
hanged
upon
it
these
men
when
they
came
to
die
were
not
frightened
god
did
not
send
any
devils
into
their
to
make
mouths
at
them
he
reserved
them
for
voltaire
who
brought
religious
liberty
to
france
he
reserved
them
for
thomas
paine
who
did
more
for
liberty
than
all
the
churches
but
all
the
inquisitors
died
with
the
white
hands
of
peace
folded
over
the
breast
of
piety
and
when
they
died
the
room
was
filled
with
the
rustle
of
the
wings
of
angels
waiting
to
bear
the
wretches
to
heaven
when
i
read
these
frightful
books
it
seems
to
me
sometimes
as
though
i
had
suffered
all
these
things
myself
it
seems
sometimes
as
though
i
had
stood
upon
the
shore
of
exile
and
gazed
with
tearful
eyes
toward
home
and
native
land
it
seems
to
me
as
though
i
had
been
staked
out
upon
the
sands
of
the
sea
and
drowned
by
the
inexorable
advancing
tide
as
though
my
nails
had
been
torn
from
my
hands
and
into
the
bleeding
quick
needles
had
been
thrust
as
though
my
feet
had
been
crushed
in
iron
boots
as
though
i
had
been
chained
in
the
cell
of
inquisition
and
listened
with
dying
ears
for
the
coming
footsteps
of
release
as
though
i
had
stood
upon
the
scaffold
and
saw
the
glittering
axe
fall
upon
me
as
though
i
had
been
upon
the
rack
and
had
seen
bending
above
me
the
white
faces
of
hypocrite
priests
as
though
i
had
been
taken
from
my
fireside
from
my
wife
and
children
taken
to
the
public
square
chained
as
though
fagots
had
been
piled
about
me
as
though
the
flames
had
climbed
around
my
limbs
and
scorched
my
eyes
to
blindness
and
as
though
my
ashes
had
been
scattered
to
the
four
winds
by
all
the
countless
hands
of
hate
and
while
i
so
feel
i
swear
that
while
i
live
i
will
do
what
little
i
can
to
augment
the
liberties
of
man
woman
and
child
i
denounce
slavery
and
superstition
everywhere
i
believe
in
liberty
and
happiness
and
love
and
joy
in
this
world
i
am
amazed
that
any
man
ever
had
the
impudence
to
try
and
do
another
man
thinking
i
have
just
as
good
a
right
to
talk
theology
as
a
minister
if
they
all
agreed
i
might
admit
it
was
a
science
but
as
all
disagree
and
the
more
they
study
the
wider
they
get
apart
i
may
be
permitted
to
suggest
it
is
not
a
science
when
no
two
will
tell
you
the
road
to
heaven
that
is
giving
you
the
same
route
and
if
you
would
inquire
of
them
all
you
would
just
give
up
trying
to
go
there
and
say
i
may
as
well
stay
where
i
am
and
let
the
lord
come
to
me
do
you
know
that
this
world
has
not
been
fit
for
a
lady
and
gentleman
to
live
in
for
years
just
on
account
of
slavery
it
was
not
until
the
year
that
great
britain
abolished
the
slave
trade
and
up
to
that
time
her
judges
her
priests
occupying
her
pulpits
the
members
of
the
royal
family
owned
stock
in
the
slave
ships
and
luxuriated
upon
the
profits
of
piracy
and
murder
it
was
not
until
the
same
year
that
the
united
states
of
america
abolished
the
slave
trade
between
this
and
other
countries
but
carefully
preserved
it
as
between
the
states
it
was
not
until
the
day
of
august
that
great
britain
abolished
human
slavery
in
her
colonies
and
it
was
not
until
the
day
of
january
that
abraham
lincoln
sustained
by
the
sublime
and
heroic
north
rendered
our
flag
pure
as
the
sky
in
which
it
floats
abraham
lincoln
was
in
my
judgment
in
many
respects
the
grandest
man
ever
president
of
the
united
states
upon
his
monument
these
words
should
be
written
here
sleeps
the
only
man
in
the
history
of
the
world
who
having
been
clothed
with
almost
absolute
power
never
abused
it
except
upon
the
side
of
mercy
for
two
hundred
years
the
christians
of
the
united
states
deliberately
turned
the
cross
of
christ
into
a
christians
bred
hounds
to
catch
other
christians
let
me
show
you
what
the
bible
has
done
for
mankind
servants
be
obedient
to
your
masters
the
only
word
coming
from
that
sweet
heaven
was
servants
obey
your
masters
frederick
douglas
told
me
that
he
had
lectured
upon
the
subject
of
freedom
twenty
years
before
he
was
permitted
to
set
his
foot
in
a
church
i
tell
you
the
world
has
not
been
fit
to
live
in
for
years
then
all
the
people
used
to
cringe
and
crawl
to
preachers
buckle
in
his
history
of
civilization
shows
that
men
were
even
struck
dead
for
speaking
impolitely
to
a
priest
god
would
not
stand
it
see
how
they
used
to
crawl
before
cardinals
bishops
and
popes
it
is
not
so
now
before
wealth
they
bowed
to
the
very
earth
and
in
the
presence
of
titles
they
became
abject
all
this
is
slowly
but
surely
changing
we
no
longer
bow
to
men
simply
because
they
are
rich
our
fathers
worshiped
the
golden
calf
the
worst
you
can
say
of
an
american
now
is
he
worships
the
gold
of
the
calf
even
the
calf
is
beginning
to
see
this
distinction
the
time
will
come
when
no
matter
how
much
money
a
man
has
he
will
not
be
respected
unless
he
is
using
it
for
the
benefit
of
his
it
will
soon
be
here
it
no
longer
satisfies
the
ambition
of
a
great
man
to
be
king
or
emperor
the
last
napoleon
was
not
satisfied
with
being
the
emperor
of
the
french
he
was
not
satisfied
with
having
a
circlet
of
gold
about
his
head
he
wanted
some
evidence
that
he
had
something
of
value
within
his
head
so
he
wrote
the
life
of
julius
caesar
that
he
might
become
a
member
of
the
french
academy
the
emperors
the
kings
the
popes
no
longer
tower
above
their
fellows
compare
for
instance
king
william
and
helmholtz
the
king
is
one
of
the
anointed
by
the
most
high
as
they
claim
one
upon
whose
head
has
been
poured
the
divine
petroleum
of
authority
compare
this
king
with
helmholtz
who
towers
an
intellectual
colossus
above
the
crowned
mediocrity
compare
george
eliot
with
queen
victoria
the
queen
is
clothed
in
garments
given
her
by
blind
fortune
and
unreasoning
chance
while
george
eliot
wears
robes
of
glory
woven
in
the
loom
of
her
own
genius
and
so
it
is
the
world
over
the
time
is
coming
when
a
man
will
be
rated
at
his
real
worth
and
that
by
his
brain
and
heart
we
care
nothing
now
about
an
officer
unless
he
fills
his
place
no
matter
if
he
is
president
if
he
rattles
in
the
place
nobody
cares
anything
about
him
i
might
give
you
an
instance
in
point
but
i
wo
the
world
is
getting
better
and
grander
and
nobler
every
day
now
if
men
have
been
slaves
if
they
have
crawled
in
the
dust
before
one
another
what
shall
i
say
of
women
they
have
been
the
slaves
of
men
it
took
thousands
of
ages
to
bring
women
from
abject
slavery
up
to
the
divine
height
of
marriage
i
believe
in
marriage
if
there
is
any
heaven
upon
earth
it
is
in
the
family
by
the
fireside
and
the
family
is
a
unit
of
government
without
the
family
relation
that
is
tender
pure
and
true
civilization
is
impossible
ladies
the
ornaments
you
wear
upon
your
persons
tonight
are
but
the
souvenirs
of
your
mother
bondage
the
chains
around
your
necks
and
the
bracelets
clasped
upon
your
white
arms
by
the
thrilled
hand
of
love
have
been
changed
by
the
wand
of
civilization
from
iron
to
shining
glittering
gold
nearly
every
civilization
in
this
world
accounts
for
the
devilment
in
it
by
the
crimes
of
woman
they
say
woman
brought
all
the
trouble
into
the
world
i
do
care
if
she
did
i
would
rather
live
in
a
world
full
of
trouble
with
the
women
i
love
than
to
live
in
heaven
with
nobody
but
men
i
read
in
a
book
an
account
of
the
creation
of
the
world
the
book
i
have
taken
pains
to
say
was
not
written
by
any
god
and
why
do
i
say
so
because
i
can
write
a
far
better
book
myself
because
it
is
full
of
barbarism
several
ministers
in
this
city
have
undertaken
to
answer
me
notably
those
who
do
believe
the
bible
themselves
i
want
to
ask
these
men
one
thing
i
want
them
to
be
fair
every
minister
in
the
city
of
chicago
that
answers
me
and
those
who
have
answered
me
had
better
answer
me
again
i
want
them
to
say
and
without
any
sort
of
evasion
without
resorting
to
any
pious
tricks
i
want
them
to
say
whether
they
believe
that
the
eternal
god
of
this
universe
ever
upheld
the
crime
of
polygamy
say
it
square
and
fair
do
begin
to
talk
about
that
being
a
peculiar
time
and
that
god
was
easy
on
the
prejudices
of
those
old
fellows
i
want
them
to
answer
that
question
and
to
answer
it
squarely
which
they
have
done
did
this
god
which
you
pretend
to
worship
ever
sanction
the
institution
of
human
slavery
now
answer
fair
do
slide
around
it
begin
and
answer
what
a
bad
man
i
am
nor
what
a
good
man
moses
was
stick
to
the
text
do
you
believe
in
a
god
that
allowed
a
man
to
be
sold
from
his
children
do
you
worship
such
an
infinite
monster
and
if
you
do
tell
your
congregation
whether
you
are
not
ashamed
to
admit
it
let
every
minister
who
answers
me
again
tell
whether
he
believes
god
commanded
his
general
to
kill
the
little
dimpled
babe
in
the
cradle
let
him
answer
it
do
say
that
those
were
very
bad
times
tell
whether
he
did
it
or
not
and
then
your
people
will
know
whether
to
hate
that
god
or
not
be
honest
tell
them
whether
that
god
in
war
captured
young
maidens
and
turned
them
over
to
the
soldiers
and
then
ask
the
wives
and
sweet
girls
of
your
congregation
to
get
down
on
their
knees
and
worship
the
infinite
fiend
that
did
that
thing
answer
it
is
your
god
i
am
talking
about
and
if
that
is
what
god
did
please
tell
your
congregation
what
under
the
same
circumstances
the
devil
would
have
done
do
tell
your
people
that
is
a
poem
do
tell
your
people
that
is
pictorial
that
wo
do
tell
your
people
whether
it
is
true
or
false
that
is
what
i
want
you
to
do
in
this
book
i
read
about
god
making
the
world
and
one
man
that
is
all
he
intended
to
make
the
making
of
woman
was
a
second
thought
though
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
as
a
rule
second
thoughts
are
best
this
god
made
a
man
and
put
him
in
a
public
park
in
a
little
while
he
noticed
that
the
man
got
lonesome
then
he
found
he
had
made
a
mistake
and
that
he
would
have
to
make
somebody
to
keep
him
company
but
having
used
up
all
the
nothing
he
originally
used
in
making
the
world
and
one
man
he
had
to
take
a
part
of
a
man
to
start
a
woman
with
so
he
causes
sleep
to
fall
on
this
man
now
understand
me
i
do
not
say
this
story
is
true
after
the
sleep
had
fallen
on
this
man
the
supreme
being
took
a
rib
or
as
the
french
would
call
it
a
cutlet
out
of
him
and
from
that
he
made
a
woman
and
i
am
willing
to
swear
taking
into
account
the
amount
and
quality
of
the
raw
material
used
this
was
the
most
magnificent
job
ever
accomplished
in
this
world
well
after
he
got
the
woman
done
she
was
brought
to
the
man
not
to
see
how
she
liked
him
but
to
see
how
he
liked
her
he
liked
her
and
they
started
housekeeping
and
they
were
told
of
certain
things
they
might
do
and
of
one
thing
they
could
not
do
and
of
course
they
did
it
i
would
have
done
it
in
fifteen
minutes
i
know
it
there
would
have
been
an
apple
on
that
tree
half
an
hour
from
date
and
the
limbs
would
have
been
full
of
clubs
and
then
they
were
turned
out
of
the
park
and
extra
policemen
were
put
on
to
keep
them
from
getting
back
and
then
trouble
commenced
and
we
have
been
at
it
ever
since
nearly
all
the
religions
of
this
world
account
for
the
existence
of
evil
by
such
a
story
as
that
well
i
read
in
another
book
what
appeared
to
be
an
account
of
the
same
transaction
it
was
written
about
four
thousand
years
before
the
other
all
commentators
agree
that
the
one
that
was
written
last
was
the
original
and
the
one
that
was
written
first
was
copied
from
the
one
that
was
written
last
but
i
would
advise
you
all
not
to
allow
your
creed
to
be
disturbed
by
a
little
matter
of
four
or
five
thousand
years
it
is
a
great
deal
better
to
be
mistaken
in
dates
than
to
go
to
the
devil
in
this
other
account
the
supreme
brahma
made
up
his
mind
to
make
the
world
and
a
man
and
woman
he
made
the
world
and
he
made
the
man
and
then
the
woman
and
put
them
on
the
island
of
ceylon
according
to
the
account
it
was
the
most
beautiful
island
of
which
man
can
conceive
such
birds
such
songs
such
flowers
and
such
verdure
and
the
branches
of
the
trees
were
so
arranged
that
when
the
wind
swept
through
them
every
tree
was
a
thousand
aeolian
harps
brahma
when
he
put
them
there
said
let
them
have
a
period
of
courtship
for
it
is
my
desire
and
will
that
true
love
should
forever
precede
marriage
when
i
read
that
it
was
so
much
more
beautiful
and
lofty
than
the
other
that
i
said
to
myself
if
either
one
of
these
stories
ever
turns
out
to
be
true
i
hope
it
will
be
this
one
then
they
had
their
courtship
with
the
nightingale
singing
and
the
stars
shining
and
the
flowers
blooming
and
they
fell
in
love
imagine
that
courtship
no
prospective
fathers
or
no
prying
and
gossiping
neighbors
nobody
to
say
young
man
how
do
you
expect
to
support
her
nothing
of
that
kind
nothing
but
the
nightingale
singing
its
song
of
joy
and
pain
as
though
the
thorn
already
touched
its
heart
they
were
married
by
the
supreme
brahma
and
he
said
to
them
remain
here
you
must
never
leave
this
island
well
after
a
little
while
the
man
and
his
name
was
adami
and
the
woman
name
was
heva
said
to
heva
i
believe
i
look
about
a
little
he
wanted
to
go
west
he
went
to
the
western
extremity
of
the
island
where
there
was
a
little
narrow
neck
of
land
connecting
it
with
the
mainland
and
the
devil
who
is
always
playing
pranks
with
us
produced
a
mirage
and
when
he
looked
over
to
the
mainland
such
hills
and
vales
such
dells
and
dales
such
mountains
crowned
with
snow
such
cataracts
clad
in
bows
of
glory
did
he
see
there
that
he
went
back
and
told
heva
the
country
over
there
is
a
thousand
times
better
than
this
let
us
migrate
she
like
every
other
woman
that
ever
lived
said
let
well
enough
alone
we
have
all
we
want
let
us
stay
here
but
he
said
no
let
us
go
so
she
followed
him
and
when
they
came
to
this
narrow
neck
of
land
he
took
her
on
his
back
like
a
gentleman
and
carried
her
over
but
the
moment
they
got
over
they
heard
a
crash
and
looking
back
discovered
that
this
narrow
neck
of
land
had
fallen
into
the
sea
the
mirage
had
disappeared
and
there
was
naught
but
rocks
and
sand
and
the
supreme
brahma
cursed
them
both
to
the
lowest
hell
then
it
was
that
the
man
spoke
and
i
have
liked
him
ever
since
for
it
curse
me
but
curse
not
her
it
was
not
her
fault
it
was
mine
that
the
kind
of
a
man
to
start
a
world
with
the
supreme
brahma
said
i
will
save
her
but
not
thee
and
she
spoke
out
of
her
fullness
of
love
out
of
a
heart
in
which
there
was
love
enough
to
make
all
her
daughters
rich
in
holy
affection
and
said
if
thou
wilt
not
spare
him
spare
neither
me
i
do
not
wish
to
live
without
him
i
love
him
then
the
supreme
brahma
said
and
i
have
liked
him
ever
since
i
read
it
i
will
spare
you
both
and
watch
over
you
and
your
children
forever
honor
bright
is
that
not
the
better
and
grander
story
and
in
that
same
book
i
find
this
man
is
strength
woman
is
beauty
man
is
courage
woman
is
love
when
the
one
man
loves
the
one
woman
and
the
one
woman
loves
the
one
man
the
very
angels
leave
heaven
and
come
and
sit
in
that
house
and
sing
for
joy
in
the
same
book
this
blessed
is
that
man
and
beloved
of
all
the
gods
who
is
afraid
of
no
man
and
of
whom
no
man
is
afraid
magnificent
character
a
missionary
certainly
ought
to
talk
to
that
man
and
i
find
this
never
will
i
accept
private
individual
salvation
but
rather
will
i
stay
and
work
strive
and
suffer
until
every
soul
from
every
star
has
been
brought
home
to
god
compare
that
with
the
christian
that
expects
to
go
to
heaven
while
the
world
is
rolling
over
niagara
to
an
eternal
and
unending
hell
so
i
say
that
religion
lays
all
the
crime
and
troubles
of
this
world
at
the
beautiful
feet
of
woman
and
then
the
church
has
the
impudence
to
say
that
it
has
exalted
women
i
believe
that
marriage
is
a
perfect
partnership
that
woman
has
every
right
that
man
has
and
one
more
the
right
to
be
protected
above
all
men
in
the
world
i
hate
a
stingy
man
a
man
that
will
make
his
wife
beg
for
money
what
did
you
do
with
the
dollar
i
gave
you
last
week
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
this
it
is
vile
no
gentleman
will
ever
be
satisfied
with
the
love
of
a
beggar
and
a
slave
no
gentleman
will
ever
be
satisfied
except
with
the
love
of
an
equal
what
kind
of
children
does
a
man
expect
to
have
with
a
beggar
for
their
mother
a
man
can
not
be
so
poor
but
that
he
can
be
generous
and
if
you
only
have
one
dollar
in
the
word
and
you
have
got
to
spend
it
spend
it
like
a
lord
spend
it
as
though
it
were
a
dry
leaf
and
you
the
owner
of
unbounded
forests
spend
it
as
though
you
had
a
wilderness
of
your
own
that
the
way
to
spend
it
i
had
rather
be
a
beggar
and
spend
my
last
dollar
like
a
king
than
be
a
king
and
spend
my
money
like
a
beggar
if
it
has
got
to
go
let
it
go
and
this
is
my
advice
to
the
poor
for
you
can
never
be
so
poor
that
whatever
you
do
you
ca
do
in
a
grand
and
manly
way
i
hate
a
cross
man
what
right
has
a
man
to
assassinate
the
joy
of
life
when
you
go
home
you
ought
to
go
like
a
ray
of
light
so
that
it
will
even
in
the
night
burst
out
of
the
doors
and
windows
and
illuminate
the
darkness
some
men
think
their
mighty
brains
have
been
in
a
turmoil
they
have
been
thinking
about
who
will
be
alderman
from
the
fifth
ward
they
have
been
thinking
about
politics
great
and
mighty
questions
have
been
engaging
their
minds
they
have
bought
calico
at
five
cents
or
six
and
want
to
sell
it
for
seven
think
of
the
intellectual
strain
that
must
have
been
upon
that
man
and
when
he
gets
home
everybody
else
in
the
house
must
look
out
for
his
comfort
a
woman
who
has
only
taken
care
of
five
or
six
children
and
one
or
two
of
them
sick
has
been
nursing
them
and
singing
to
them
and
trying
to
make
one
yard
of
cloth
do
the
work
of
two
she
of
course
is
fresh
and
fine
and
ready
to
wait
upon
this
gentleman
the
head
of
the
family
the
boss
i
was
reading
the
other
day
of
an
apparatus
invented
for
the
ejecting
of
gentlemen
who
subsist
upon
free
lunches
it
is
so
arranged
that
when
the
fellow
gets
both
hands
into
the
victuals
a
large
hand
descends
upon
him
jams
his
hat
over
his
eyes
he
is
seized
turned
toward
the
door
and
just
in
the
nick
of
time
an
immense
boot
comes
from
the
other
side
kicks
him
in
italics
sends
him
out
over
the
sidewalk
and
lands
him
rolling
in
the
gutter
i
never
hear
of
such
a
man
a
boss
that
i
do
feel
as
though
that
machine
ought
to
be
brought
into
requisition
for
his
benefit
love
is
the
only
thing
that
will
pay
ten
per
cent
of
interest
on
the
outlay
love
is
the
only
thing
in
which
the
height
of
extravagance
is
the
last
degree
of
economy
it
is
the
only
thing
i
tell
you
joy
is
wealth
love
is
the
legal
tender
of
the
soul
and
you
need
not
be
rich
to
be
happy
we
have
all
been
raised
on
success
in
this
country
always
been
talked
with
about
being
successful
and
have
never
thought
ourselves
very
rich
unless
we
were
the
possessors
of
some
magnificent
mansion
and
unless
our
names
have
been
between
the
putrid
lips
of
rumor
we
could
not
be
happy
every
little
boy
is
striving
to
be
this
and
be
that
i
tell
you
the
happy
man
is
the
successful
man
the
man
that
has
won
the
love
of
one
good
woman
is
a
successful
man
the
man
that
has
been
the
emperor
of
one
good
heart
and
that
heart
embraced
all
his
has
been
a
success
if
another
has
been
the
emperor
of
the
round
world
and
has
never
loved
and
been
loved
his
life
is
a
failure
it
wo
do
let
us
teach
our
children
the
other
way
that
the
happy
man
is
the
successful
man
and
he
who
is
a
happy
man
is
the
one
who
always
tries
to
make
some
one
else
happy
the
man
who
marries
a
woman
to
make
her
happy
that
marries
her
as
much
for
her
own
sake
as
for
his
own
not
the
man
that
thinks
his
wife
is
his
property
who
thinks
that
the
title
to
her
belongs
to
him
that
the
woman
is
the
property
of
the
man
wretches
who
get
mad
at
their
wives
and
then
shoot
them
down
in
the
street
because
they
think
the
woman
is
their
property
i
tell
you
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
rich
and
great
and
powerful
to
be
happy
a
little
while
ago
i
stood
by
the
grave
of
the
old
napoleon
a
magnificent
tomb
of
gilt
and
gold
fit
almost
for
a
dead
deity
and
gazed
upon
the
sarcophagus
of
black
egyptian
marble
where
rest
at
last
the
ashes
of
the
restless
man
i
leaned
over
the
balustrade
and
thought
about
the
career
of
the
greatest
soldier
of
the
modern
world
i
saw
him
walk
upon
the
banks
of
the
seine
contemplating
suicide
i
saw
him
at
toulon
i
saw
him
putting
down
the
mob
in
the
streets
of
paris
i
saw
him
at
the
head
of
the
army
of
italy
i
saw
him
crossing
the
bridge
of
lodi
with
the
in
his
hand
i
saw
him
in
egypt
in
the
shadows
of
the
pyramids
i
saw
him
conquer
the
alps
and
mingle
the
eagles
of
france
with
the
eagles
of
the
crags
i
saw
him
at
marengo
at
ulm
and
austerlitz
i
saw
him
in
russia
where
the
infantry
of
the
snow
and
the
cavalry
of
the
wild
blast
scattered
his
legions
like
winter
withered
leaves
i
saw
him
at
leipzig
in
defeat
and
disaster
driven
by
a
million
bayonets
back
upon
paris
clutched
like
a
wild
beast
banished
to
elba
i
saw
him
escape
and
retake
an
empire
by
the
force
of
his
genius
i
saw
him
upon
the
frightful
field
of
waterloo
where
chance
and
fate
combined
to
wreck
the
fortunes
of
their
former
king
and
i
saw
him
at
helena
with
his
hands
crossed
behind
him
gazing
out
upon
the
sad
and
solemn
sea
i
thought
of
the
orphans
and
widows
he
had
made
of
the
tears
that
had
been
shed
for
his
glory
and
of
the
only
woman
who
ever
loved
him
pushed
from
his
heart
by
the
cold
hand
of
ambition
and
i
said
i
would
rather
have
been
a
french
peasant
and
worn
wooden
shoes
i
would
rather
have
lived
in
a
hut
with
a
vine
growing
over
the
door
and
the
grapes
growing
purple
in
the
kisses
of
the
autumn
sun
i
would
rather
have
been
that
poor
peasant
with
my
loving
wife
by
my
side
knitting
as
the
day
died
out
of
the
sky
with
my
children
upon
my
knees
and
their
arms
about
me
i
would
rather
have
been
that
man
and
gone
down
to
the
tongueless
silence
of
the
dreamless
dust
than
to
have
been
that
imperial
impersonation
of
force
and
murder
known
as
napoleon
the
great
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
rich
in
order
to
be
happy
it
is
only
necessary
to
be
in
love
thousands
of
men
go
to
college
and
get
a
certificate
that
they
have
an
education
and
that
certificate
is
in
latin
and
they
stop
studying
and
in
two
years
to
save
their
life
they
could
read
the
certificate
they
got
it
is
mostly
so
in
marrying
they
stop
courting
when
they
get
married
they
think
we
have
won
her
and
that
is
enough
ah
the
difference
before
and
after
how
well
they
look
how
bright
their
eyes
how
light
their
steps
and
how
full
they
were
of
generosity
and
laughter
i
tell
you
a
man
should
consider
himself
in
good
luck
if
a
woman
loves
him
when
he
is
doing
his
level
best
good
luck
good
luck
and
another
thing
that
is
the
cause
of
much
trouble
is
that
people
count
fairly
they
do
what
they
call
putting
their
best
foot
forward
that
means
lying
a
little
i
say
put
your
worst
foot
forward
if
you
have
got
any
faults
admit
them
if
you
drink
say
so
and
quit
it
if
you
chew
and
smoke
and
swear
say
so
if
some
of
your
kindred
are
not
very
good
people
say
so
if
you
have
had
two
or
three
that
died
on
the
gallows
or
that
ought
to
have
died
there
say
so
tell
all
your
faults
and
if
after
she
knows
your
faults
she
says
she
will
have
you
you
have
got
the
dead
wood
on
that
woman
forever
i
claim
that
there
should
be
perfect
equality
in
the
home
and
i
can
not
think
of
anything
nearer
heaven
than
a
home
where
there
is
true
republicanism
and
true
democracy
at
the
fireside
all
are
equal
and
then
do
you
know
i
like
to
think
that
love
is
eternal
that
if
you
really
love
the
woman
for
her
sake
you
will
love
her
no
matter
what
she
may
do
that
if
she
really
loves
you
for
your
sake
the
same
that
love
does
not
look
at
alterations
through
the
wrinkles
of
time
through
the
mask
of
years
if
you
really
love
her
you
will
always
see
the
face
you
loved
and
won
and
i
like
to
think
of
it
if
a
man
loves
a
woman
she
does
not
ever
grow
old
to
him
and
the
woman
who
really
loves
a
man
does
not
see
that
he
is
growing
older
he
is
not
decrepit
to
her
he
is
not
tremulous
he
is
not
old
he
is
not
bowed
she
always
sees
the
same
gallant
fellow
that
won
her
hand
and
heart
i
like
to
think
of
it
in
that
way
and
as
shakespeare
says
let
time
reach
with
his
sickle
as
far
as
ever
he
can
although
he
can
reach
ruddy
cheeks
and
ripe
lips
and
flashing
eyes
he
can
not
quite
reach
love
i
like
to
think
of
it
we
will
go
down
the
hill
of
life
together
and
enter
the
shadow
one
with
the
other
and
as
we
go
down
we
may
hear
the
ripple
of
the
laughter
of
our
grandchildren
and
the
birds
and
spring
and
youth
and
love
will
sing
once
more
upon
the
leafless
branches
of
the
tree
of
age
i
love
to
think
of
it
in
that
way
absolute
equals
happy
happy
and
free
all
our
own
but
some
people
say
would
you
allow
a
woman
to
vote
yes
if
she
wants
to
that
is
her
business
not
mine
if
a
woman
wants
to
vote
i
am
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
say
she
shall
not
but
they
say
woman
has
not
sense
enough
to
vote
it
do
take
much
but
it
seems
to
me
there
are
some
questions
as
for
instance
the
question
of
peace
or
war
that
a
woman
should
be
allowed
to
vote
upon
a
woman
that
has
sons
to
be
offered
on
the
altar
of
that
moloch
it
seems
to
me
that
such
a
woman
should
have
as
much
right
to
vote
upon
the
question
of
peace
and
war
as
some
sot
that
reels
to
the
ballot
box
and
deposits
his
vote
for
war
but
if
women
have
been
slaves
what
shall
we
say
of
the
little
children
born
in
the
children
of
poverty
children
of
crime
children
of
wealth
children
that
are
afraid
when
they
hear
their
names
pronounced
by
the
lips
of
their
mother
children
that
cower
in
fear
when
they
hear
the
footsteps
of
their
brutal
father
the
flotsam
and
jetsam
upon
the
rude
sea
of
life
my
heart
goes
out
to
them
one
and
all
children
have
all
the
rights
that
we
have
and
one
more
and
that
is
to
be
protected
treat
your
children
in
that
way
suppose
your
child
tells
a
lie
do
pretend
that
the
whole
world
is
going
into
bankruptcy
do
pretend
that
that
is
the
first
lie
ever
told
tell
them
like
an
honest
man
that
you
have
told
hundreds
of
lies
yourself
and
tell
the
dear
little
darling
that
it
is
not
the
best
way
that
it
soils
the
soul
think
of
the
man
that
deals
in
stocks
whipping
his
children
for
putting
false
rumors
afloat
think
of
an
orthodox
minister
whipping
his
own
flesh
and
blood
for
not
telling
all
it
thinks
think
of
that
think
of
a
lawyer
for
beating
his
child
for
avoiding
the
truth
when
the
old
man
makes
about
half
his
living
that
way
a
lie
is
born
of
weakness
on
one
side
and
tyranny
on
the
other
that
is
what
it
is
think
of
a
great
big
man
coming
at
a
little
bit
of
a
child
with
a
club
in
his
hand
what
is
the
little
darling
to
do
lie
of
course
i
think
that
mother
nature
put
that
ingenuity
into
the
mind
of
the
child
when
attacked
by
a
parent
to
throw
up
a
little
breastwork
in
the
shape
of
a
lie
to
defend
itself
when
a
great
general
wins
a
battle
by
what
they
call
strategy
we
build
monuments
to
him
what
is
strategy
lies
suppose
a
man
as
much
larger
than
we
are
as
we
are
larger
than
a
child
five
years
of
age
should
come
at
us
with
a
liberty
pole
in
his
hand
and
in
tones
of
thunder
want
to
know
who
broke
that
plate
there
is
one
of
us
not
excepting
myself
that
would
swear
that
we
never
had
seen
that
plate
in
our
lives
or
that
it
was
cracked
when
we
got
it
another
good
way
to
make
children
tell
the
truth
is
to
tell
it
yourself
keep
your
word
with
your
child
the
same
as
you
would
with
your
banker
if
you
tell
a
child
you
will
do
anything
either
do
it
or
give
the
child
the
reason
why
truth
is
born
of
confidence
it
comes
from
the
lips
of
love
and
liberty
i
was
over
in
michigan
the
other
day
there
was
a
boy
over
there
at
grand
rapids
about
five
or
six
years
old
a
nice
smart
boy
as
you
will
see
from
the
remark
he
made
what
you
might
call
a
nineteenth
century
boy
his
father
and
mother
had
promised
to
take
him
out
riding
they
had
promised
to
take
him
out
riding
for
about
three
weeks
and
they
would
slip
off
and
go
without
him
well
after
while
that
got
kind
of
played
out
with
the
little
boy
and
the
day
before
i
was
there
they
played
the
trick
on
him
again
they
went
out
and
got
the
carriage
and
went
away
and
as
they
rode
away
from
the
front
of
the
house
he
happened
to
be
standing
there
with
his
nurse
and
he
saw
them
the
whole
thing
flashed
on
him
in
a
moment
he
took
in
the
situation
and
turned
to
his
nurse
and
said
pointing
to
his
father
and
mother
there
go
the
two
d
t
liars
in
the
state
of
michigan
when
you
go
home
fill
the
house
with
joy
so
that
the
light
of
it
will
stream
out
the
windows
and
doors
and
illuminate
even
the
darkness
it
is
just
as
easy
that
way
as
any
in
the
world
i
want
to
tell
you
tonight
that
you
can
not
get
the
robe
of
hypocrisy
on
you
so
thick
that
the
sharp
eye
of
childhood
will
not
see
through
every
veil
and
if
you
pretend
to
your
children
that
you
are
the
best
man
that
ever
lived
the
bravest
man
that
ever
lived
they
will
find
you
out
every
time
they
will
not
have
the
same
opinion
of
father
when
they
grow
up
that
they
used
to
have
they
will
have
to
be
in
mighty
bad
luck
if
they
ever
do
meaner
things
than
you
have
done
when
your
child
confesses
to
you
that
it
has
committed
a
fault
take
that
child
in
your
arms
and
let
it
feel
your
heart
beat
against
its
heart
and
raise
your
children
in
the
sunlight
of
love
and
they
will
be
sunbeams
to
you
along
the
pathway
of
life
abolish
the
club
and
the
whip
from
the
house
because
if
the
civilized
use
a
whip
the
ignorant
and
the
brutal
will
use
a
club
and
they
will
use
it
because
you
use
the
whip
every
little
while
some
door
is
thrown
open
in
some
orphan
asylum
and
there
we
see
the
bleeding
back
of
a
child
whipped
beneath
the
roof
that
was
raised
by
love
it
is
infamous
and
a
man
that
ca
raise
a
child
without
the
whip
ought
not
to
have
a
child
if
there
is
one
of
you
here
that
ever
expect
to
whip
your
child
again
let
me
ask
you
something
have
your
photograph
taken
at
the
time
and
let
it
show
your
face
red
with
vulgar
anger
and
the
face
of
the
little
one
with
eyes
swimming
in
tears
and
the
little
chin
dimpled
with
fear
looking
like
a
piece
of
water
struck
by
a
sudden
cold
wind
if
that
little
child
should
die
i
can
not
think
of
a
sweeter
way
to
spend
an
autumn
afternoon
than
to
take
that
photograph
and
go
to
the
cemetery
when
the
maples
are
clad
in
tender
gold
and
when
little
scarlet
runners
are
coming
from
the
sad
heart
of
the
earth
and
sit
down
upon
that
mound
and
look
upon
that
photograph
and
think
of
the
flesh
now
dust
that
you
beat
just
think
of
it
i
could
not
bear
to
die
in
the
arms
of
a
child
that
i
had
whipped
i
could
not
bear
to
feel
upon
my
lips
when
they
were
withered
beneath
the
touch
of
death
the
kiss
of
one
that
i
had
struck
some
christians
act
as
though
they
really
thought
that
when
christ
said
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me
he
had
a
rawhide
under
his
coat
they
act
as
though
they
really
thought
that
he
made
that
remark
simply
to
get
the
children
within
striking
distance
i
have
known
christians
to
turn
their
children
from
their
doors
especially
a
daughter
and
then
get
down
on
their
knees
and
pray
to
god
to
watch
over
them
and
help
them
i
will
never
ask
god
to
help
my
children
unless
i
am
doing
my
level
best
in
that
same
wretched
line
i
will
tell
you
what
i
say
to
my
girls
go
where
you
will
do
what
crime
you
may
fall
to
what
depth
of
degradation
you
may
in
all
the
storms
and
winds
and
earthquakes
of
life
no
matter
what
you
do
you
never
can
commit
any
crime
that
will
shut
my
door
my
arms
or
my
heart
to
you
as
long
as
i
live
you
have
one
sincere
friend
call
me
an
atheist
call
me
an
infidel
because
i
hate
the
god
of
the
jew
which
i
do
i
intend
so
to
live
that
when
i
die
my
children
can
come
to
my
grave
and
truthfully
say
he
who
sleeps
here
never
gave
us
one
moment
of
pain
when
i
was
a
boy
there
was
one
day
in
each
week
too
good
for
a
child
to
be
happy
in
in
these
good
old
times
sunday
commenced
when
the
sun
went
down
on
saturday
night
and
closed
when
the
sun
went
down
on
sunday
night
we
commenced
saturday
to
get
a
good
ready
and
when
the
sun
went
down
saturday
night
there
was
a
gloom
deeper
than
midnight
that
fell
upon
the
house
you
could
not
crack
hickory
nuts
then
and
if
you
were
caught
chewing
gum
it
was
only
another
evidence
of
the
total
depravity
of
the
human
heart
well
after
a
while
we
got
to
bed
sadly
and
sorrowfully
after
having
heard
heaven
thanked
that
we
were
not
all
in
hell
and
i
sometimes
used
to
wonder
how
the
mercy
of
god
lasted
as
long
as
it
did
because
i
recollected
that
on
several
occasions
i
had
not
been
at
school
when
i
was
supposed
to
be
there
why
i
was
not
burned
to
a
crisp
was
a
mystery
to
me
the
next
morning
we
got
ready
for
church
all
solemn
and
when
we
got
there
the
minister
was
up
in
the
pulpit
about
twenty
feet
high
and
he
commenced
at
genesis
about
the
fall
of
man
and
he
went
on
to
about
twenty
thirdly
then
he
struck
the
second
application
and
when
he
struck
the
application
i
knew
he
was
about
half
way
through
and
then
he
went
on
to
show
the
scheme
how
the
lord
was
satisfied
by
punishing
the
wrong
man
nobody
but
a
god
would
have
thought
of
that
ingenious
way
well
when
he
got
through
that
then
came
the
catechism
the
chief
end
of
man
then
my
turn
came
and
we
sat
along
on
a
little
bench
where
our
feet
came
within
about
fifteen
inches
of
the
floor
and
the
dear
old
minister
used
to
ask
us
boys
do
you
know
that
you
ought
to
be
in
hell
and
we
answered
up
as
cheerfully
as
could
be
expected
under
the
circumstances
yes
sir
well
boys
do
you
know
that
you
would
go
to
hell
if
you
died
in
your
sins
and
we
said
yes
sir
and
then
came
the
great
test
boys
i
ca
get
the
tone
you
know
and
do
you
know
that
is
how
the
preachers
get
the
bronchitis
you
never
heard
of
an
auctioneer
getting
the
bronchitis
nor
the
second
mate
on
a
steamboat
never
what
gives
it
to
the
minister
is
talking
solemnly
when
they
do
feel
that
way
and
it
has
the
same
influence
upon
the
organs
of
speech
that
it
would
have
upon
the
cords
of
the
calves
of
your
legs
to
walk
on
your
and
so
i
call
bronchitis
parsonitis
and
if
the
ministers
would
all
tell
exactly
what
they
think
they
would
all
get
well
but
keeping
back
a
part
of
the
truth
is
what
gives
them
bronchitis
well
the
old
man
the
dear
old
minister
used
to
try
and
show
us
how
long
we
would
be
in
hell
if
we
would
only
locate
there
but
to
finish
the
other
the
grand
test
question
was
boys
if
it
was
god
will
that
you
should
go
to
hell
would
you
be
willing
to
go
and
every
little
liar
said
yes
sir
then
in
order
to
tell
how
long
we
would
stay
there
he
used
to
say
suppose
once
in
a
billion
ages
a
bird
should
come
from
a
far
distant
clime
and
carry
off
in
its
bill
one
little
grain
of
sand
the
time
would
finally
come
when
the
last
grain
of
sand
would
be
carried
away
do
you
understand
yes
sir
boys
by
that
time
it
would
not
be
in
hell
where
did
that
doctrine
of
hell
come
from
i
will
tell
you
from
that
fellow
in
the
where
did
he
get
it
it
was
a
souvenir
from
the
wild
beasts
yes
i
tell
you
he
got
it
from
the
wild
beasts
from
the
glittering
eye
of
the
serpent
from
the
coiling
twisting
snakes
with
their
fangs
mouths
and
it
came
from
the
bark
growl
and
howl
of
wild
beasts
it
was
born
of
a
laugh
of
the
hyena
and
got
it
from
the
depraved
chatter
of
malicious
apes
and
i
despise
it
with
every
drop
of
my
blood
and
defy
it
if
there
is
any
god
in
this
universe
who
will
damn
his
children
for
an
expression
of
an
honest
thought
i
wish
to
go
to
hell
i
would
rather
go
there
than
go
to
heaven
and
keep
the
company
of
a
god
that
would
thus
damn
his
children
oh
it
is
an
infamous
doctrine
to
teach
that
to
little
children
to
put
a
shadow
in
the
heart
of
a
child
to
fill
the
insane
asylums
with
that
miserable
infamous
lie
i
see
now
and
then
a
little
girl
a
dear
little
darling
with
a
face
like
the
light
and
eyes
of
joy
a
human
blossom
and
i
think
is
it
possible
that
little
girl
will
ever
grow
up
to
be
a
presbyterian
is
it
possible
my
goodness
that
that
flower
will
finally
believe
in
the
five
points
of
calvinism
or
in
the
eternal
damnation
of
man
is
it
possible
that
that
little
fairy
will
finally
believe
that
she
could
be
happy
in
heaven
with
her
baby
in
hell
think
of
it
think
of
it
and
that
is
the
christian
religion
we
cry
out
against
the
indian
mother
that
throws
her
child
into
the
ganges
to
be
devoured
by
the
alligator
or
crocodile
but
that
is
joy
in
comparison
with
the
christian
mother
hope
that
she
may
be
in
salvation
while
her
brave
boy
is
in
hell
i
tell
you
i
want
to
kick
the
doctrine
about
hell
i
want
to
kick
it
out
every
time
i
go
by
it
i
want
to
get
americans
in
this
country
placed
so
they
will
be
ashamed
to
preach
it
i
want
to
get
the
congregations
so
that
they
wo
listen
to
it
we
can
not
divide
the
world
off
into
saints
and
sinners
in
that
way
there
is
a
little
girl
fair
as
a
flower
and
she
grows
up
until
she
is
twelve
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
old
are
you
going
to
damn
her
in
the
fifteenth
sixteenth
or
seventeenth
year
when
the
arrow
from
cupid
bow
touches
her
heart
and
she
is
glorified
are
you
going
to
damn
her
now
she
marries
and
loves
and
holds
in
her
arms
a
beautiful
child
are
you
going
to
damn
her
now
when
are
you
going
to
damn
her
because
she
has
listened
to
some
methodist
minister
and
after
all
that
flood
of
light
failed
to
believe
are
you
going
to
damn
her
then
i
tell
you
god
can
not
afford
to
damn
such
a
woman
a
woman
in
the
state
of
indiana
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
who
carded
the
wool
and
made
rolls
and
spun
them
and
made
the
cloth
and
cut
out
the
clothes
for
the
children
and
nursed
them
and
sat
up
with
them
nights
and
gave
them
medicine
and
held
them
in
her
arms
and
wept
over
them
cried
for
joy
and
wept
for
fear
and
finally
raised
ten
or
eleven
good
men
and
women
with
the
ruddy
glow
of
health
upon
their
cheeks
and
she
would
have
died
for
any
one
of
them
any
moment
of
her
life
and
finally
she
bowed
with
age
and
bent
with
care
and
labor
dies
and
at
the
moment
the
magical
touch
of
death
is
upon
her
face
she
looks
as
though
she
never
had
had
a
care
and
her
children
burying
her
cover
her
face
with
tears
do
you
tell
me
god
can
afford
to
damn
that
kind
of
a
woman
one
such
act
of
injustice
would
turn
heaven
itself
into
hell
if
there
is
any
god
sitting
above
him
in
infinite
serenity
we
have
the
figure
of
justice
even
a
god
must
do
justice
even
a
god
must
worship
justice
and
any
form
of
superstition
that
destroys
justice
is
infamous
just
think
of
teaching
that
doctrine
to
little
children
a
little
child
would
go
out
into
the
garden
and
there
would
be
a
little
tree
laden
with
blossoms
and
the
little
fellow
would
lean
against
it
and
there
would
be
a
bird
on
one
of
the
boughs
singing
and
swinging
and
thinking
about
four
little
speckled
eggs
warmed
by
the
breast
of
its
mate
and
singing
and
swinging
and
the
music
in
in
happy
waves
rippling
out
of
the
tiny
throat
and
the
flowers
blossoming
the
air
filled
with
perfume
and
the
great
white
clouds
floating
in
the
sky
and
the
little
boy
would
lean
up
against
the
tree
and
think
about
hell
and
the
worm
that
never
dies
oh
the
idea
there
can
be
any
day
too
good
for
a
child
to
be
happy
in
well
after
we
got
over
the
catechism
then
came
the
sermon
in
the
afternoon
and
it
was
exactly
like
the
one
in
the
forenoon
except
the
other
end
to
then
we
started
for
home
a
solemn
march
not
a
soldier
discharged
his
farewell
shot
and
when
we
got
home
if
we
had
been
really
good
boys
we
used
to
be
taken
up
to
the
cemetery
to
cheer
us
up
and
it
always
did
cheer
me
those
sunken
graves
those
leaning
stones
those
gloomy
epitaphs
covered
with
the
moss
of
years
always
cheered
me
when
i
looked
at
them
i
said
well
this
kind
of
thing
ca
last
always
then
we
came
back
home
and
we
had
books
to
read
which
were
very
eloquent
and
amusing
we
had
josephus
and
the
history
of
the
waldenses
and
fox
book
of
martyrs
saint
rest
and
jenkyn
on
the
atonement
i
used
to
read
jenkyn
with
a
good
deal
of
pleasure
and
i
often
thought
that
the
atonement
would
have
to
be
very
broad
in
its
provisions
to
cover
the
case
of
a
man
that
would
i
write
such
a
book
for
boys
then
i
would
look
to
see
how
the
sun
was
getting
on
and
sometimes
i
thought
it
had
stuck
from
pure
cussedness
then
i
would
go
back
and
try
jenkyn
again
well
but
it
had
to
go
down
and
when
the
last
rim
of
light
sank
below
the
horizon
off
would
go
our
hats
and
we
would
give
three
cheers
for
liberty
once
again
i
tell
you
do
make
slaves
of
your
children
on
sunday
the
idea
that
there
is
any
god
that
hates
to
hear
a
child
laugh
let
your
children
play
games
on
sunday
here
is
a
poor
man
that
money
enough
to
go
to
a
big
church
and
he
has
too
much
independence
to
go
to
a
little
church
that
the
big
church
built
for
charity
he
does
want
to
slide
into
heaven
that
way
i
tell
you
do
come
to
church
but
go
to
the
woods
and
take
your
family
and
a
lunch
with
you
and
sit
down
upon
the
old
log
and
let
the
children
gather
flowers
and
hear
the
leaves
whispering
poems
like
memories
of
long
ago
and
when
the
sun
is
about
going
down
kissing
the
summits
of
far
hills
go
home
with
your
hearts
filled
with
throbs
of
joy
there
is
more
recreation
and
joy
in
that
than
going
to
a
dry
goods
box
with
a
steeple
on
top
of
it
and
hearing
a
man
tell
you
that
your
chances
are
about
to
one
for
being
eternally
damned
let
us
make
this
sunday
a
day
of
splendid
pleasure
not
to
excess
but
to
everything
that
makes
man
purer
and
grander
and
nobler
i
would
like
to
see
now
something
like
this
instead
of
so
many
churches
a
vast
cathedral
that
would
hold
twenty
or
thirty
thousands
of
people
and
i
would
like
to
see
an
opera
produced
in
it
that
would
make
the
souls
of
men
have
higher
and
grander
and
nobler
aims
i
would
like
to
see
the
walls
covered
with
pictures
and
the
niches
rich
with
statuary
i
would
like
to
see
something
put
there
that
you
could
use
in
this
world
now
and
i
do
not
believe
in
sacrificing
the
present
to
the
future
i
do
not
believe
in
drinking
skimmed
milk
here
with
the
promise
of
butter
beyond
the
clouds
space
or
time
can
not
be
holy
any
more
than
a
vacuum
can
be
pious
not
a
bit
not
a
bit
and
no
day
can
be
so
holy
but
what
the
laugh
of
a
child
will
make
it
holier
still
strike
with
hand
of
fire
on
weird
musician
thy
harp
strung
with
apollo
golden
hair
fill
the
vast
cathedral
aisles
with
symphonies
sweet
and
dim
deft
toucher
of
the
organ
keys
blow
bugler
blow
until
thy
silver
notes
do
touch
and
kiss
the
moonlit
waves
and
charm
the
lovers
wandering
the
hills
but
know
your
sweetest
strains
are
discords
all
compared
with
childhood
happy
laugh
the
laugh
that
fills
the
eyes
with
light
and
every
heart
with
joy
o
rippling
river
of
laughter
thou
art
the
blessed
boundary
line
between
the
beasts
and
men
and
every
wayward
wave
of
thine
doth
drown
some
fretful
fiend
of
care
o
laughter
rose
lipped
daughter
of
joy
there
are
dimples
enough
in
thy
cheeks
to
catch
and
hold
and
glorify
all
the
tears
of
grief
do
plant
your
children
in
long
straight
rows
like
posts
let
them
have
light
and
air
and
let
them
grow
beautiful
as
palms
when
i
was
a
little
boy
children
went
to
bed
when
they
were
not
sleepy
and
always
got
up
when
they
were
i
would
like
to
see
that
changed
but
they
say
we
are
too
poor
some
of
us
to
do
it
well
all
right
it
is
as
easy
to
wake
a
child
with
a
kiss
as
with
a
blow
with
kindness
as
with
curse
and
another
thing
let
the
children
eat
what
they
want
to
let
them
commence
at
whichever
end
of
the
dinner
they
desire
that
is
my
doctrine
they
know
what
they
want
much
better
than
you
do
nature
is
a
great
deal
smarter
than
you
ever
were
all
the
advance
that
has
been
made
in
the
science
of
medicine
has
been
made
by
the
recklessness
of
patients
i
can
recollect
when
they
would
give
a
man
water
in
a
fever
not
a
drop
now
and
then
some
fellow
would
get
so
thirsty
he
would
say
well
i
die
any
way
so
i
drink
it
and
thereupon
he
would
drink
a
gallon
of
water
and
thereupon
he
would
burst
into
a
generous
perspiration
and
get
well
and
the
next
morning
when
the
doctor
would
come
to
see
him
they
would
tell
him
about
the
man
drinking
the
water
and
he
would
say
how
much
well
he
swallowed
two
pitchers
full
is
he
alive
yes
so
they
would
go
into
the
room
and
the
doctor
would
feel
his
pulse
and
ask
him
did
you
drink
two
pitchers
of
water
yes
my
god
what
a
constitution
you
have
got
i
tell
you
there
is
something
splendid
in
man
that
will
not
always
mind
why
if
we
had
done
as
the
kings
told
us
five
hundred
years
ago
we
would
all
have
been
slaves
if
we
had
done
as
the
priests
told
us
we
would
all
have
been
idiots
if
we
had
done
as
the
doctors
told
us
we
would
all
have
been
dead
we
have
been
saved
by
disobedience
we
have
been
saved
by
that
splendid
thing
called
independence
and
i
want
to
see
more
of
it
day
after
day
and
i
want
to
see
children
raised
so
they
will
have
it
that
is
my
doctrine
give
the
children
a
chance
be
perfectly
honor
bright
with
them
and
they
will
be
your
friends
when
you
are
old
do
try
to
teach
them
something
they
can
never
learn
do
insist
upon
their
pursuing
some
calling
they
have
no
sort
of
faculty
for
do
make
that
poor
girl
play
ten
years
on
a
piano
when
she
has
no
ear
for
music
and
when
she
has
practiced
until
she
can
play
bonaparte
crossing
the
alps
and
you
ca
tell
after
she
has
played
it
whether
bonaparte
ever
got
across
or
not
men
are
oaks
women
are
vines
children
are
flowers
and
if
there
is
any
heaven
in
this
world
it
is
in
the
family
it
is
where
the
wife
loves
the
husband
and
the
husband
loves
the
wife
and
where
the
dimpled
arms
of
children
are
about
the
necks
of
both
that
is
heaven
if
there
is
any
and
i
do
not
want
any
better
heaven
in
another
world
than
that
and
if
in
another
world
i
can
not
live
with
the
ones
i
loved
here
then
i
would
rather
not
be
there
i
would
rather
resign
well
my
friends
i
have
some
excuses
to
make
for
the
race
to
which
i
belong
in
the
first
place
this
world
is
not
very
well
adapted
to
raising
good
men
and
good
women
it
is
three
times
better
adapted
to
the
cultivation
of
fish
than
of
people
there
is
one
little
narrow
belt
running
zigzag
around
the
world
in
which
men
and
women
of
genius
can
be
raised
and
that
is
all
it
is
with
man
as
it
is
with
vegetation
in
the
valley
you
find
the
oak
and
elm
tossing
their
branches
defiantly
to
the
storm
and
as
you
advance
up
the
mountain
side
the
hemlock
the
pine
the
birch
the
spruce
the
fir
and
finally
you
come
to
little
dwarfed
trees
that
look
like
other
trees
seen
through
a
telescope
reversed
every
limb
twisted
as
through
pain
getting
a
scanty
subsistence
from
the
miserly
crevices
of
the
rocks
you
go
on
and
on
until
at
last
the
highest
crag
is
freckled
with
a
kind
of
moss
and
vegetation
ends
you
might
as
well
try
to
raise
oaks
and
elms
where
the
mosses
grow
as
to
raise
great
men
and
women
where
their
surroundings
are
unfavorable
you
must
have
the
proper
climate
and
soil
there
never
has
been
a
man
or
woman
of
genius
from
the
southern
hemisphere
because
the
lord
did
allow
the
right
climate
to
fall
upon
the
land
it
falls
upon
the
water
there
never
was
much
civilization
except
where
there
has
been
snow
and
ordinarily
decent
winter
you
ca
have
civilization
without
it
where
man
needs
no
bedclothes
but
clouds
revolution
is
the
normal
condition
of
such
a
people
it
is
the
winter
that
gives
us
the
home
it
is
the
winter
that
gives
us
the
fireside
and
the
family
relation
and
all
the
beautiful
flowers
of
love
that
adorn
that
relation
civilization
liberty
justice
charity
and
intellectual
advancement
are
all
flowers
that
bloom
in
the
drifted
snow
you
ca
have
them
anywhere
else
and
that
is
the
reason
we
of
the
north
are
civilized
and
that
is
the
reason
that
civilization
has
always
been
with
winter
that
is
the
reason
that
philosophy
has
been
here
and
in
spite
of
all
our
superstitions
we
have
advanced
beyond
some
of
the
other
races
because
we
have
had
this
assistance
of
nature
that
drove
us
into
the
family
relation
that
made
us
prudent
that
made
us
lay
up
at
one
time
for
another
season
of
the
year
so
there
is
one
excuse
i
have
for
my
race
i
have
got
another
i
think
we
came
from
the
lower
animals
i
am
not
dead
sure
of
it
but
think
so
when
i
first
read
about
it
i
like
it
my
heart
was
filled
with
sympathy
for
those
people
who
have
nothing
to
be
proud
of
except
ancestors
i
thought
how
terrible
it
will
be
upon
the
nobility
of
the
old
world
think
of
their
being
forced
to
trace
their
ancestry
back
to
the
duke
or
to
the
princess
chimpanzee
after
thinking
it
all
over
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
liked
that
doctrine
i
became
convinced
in
spite
of
myself
i
read
about
rudimentary
bones
and
muscles
i
was
told
that
everybody
had
rudimentary
muscles
extending
from
the
ear
into
the
cheek
i
asked
what
are
they
i
was
told
they
are
the
remains
of
muscles
that
they
became
rudimentary
from
the
lack
of
use
they
went
into
bankruptcy
they
are
the
muscles
with
which
your
ancestors
used
to
flap
their
ears
well
at
first
i
was
greatly
astonished
and
afterward
i
was
more
astonished
to
find
they
had
become
rudimentary
how
can
you
account
for
john
calvin
unless
we
came
up
from
the
lower
animals
how
could
you
account
for
a
man
that
would
use
the
extremes
of
torture
unless
you
admit
that
there
is
in
man
the
elements
of
a
snake
of
a
vulture
a
hyena
and
a
jackal
how
can
you
account
for
the
religious
creeds
of
today
how
can
you
account
for
that
infamous
doctrine
of
hell
except
with
an
animal
origin
how
can
you
account
for
your
conception
of
a
god
that
would
sell
women
and
babes
into
slavery
well
i
thought
that
thing
over
and
i
began
to
like
it
after
a
while
and
i
said
it
is
not
so
much
difference
who
my
father
was
as
who
his
son
is
and
i
finally
said
i
would
rather
belong
to
a
race
that
commenced
with
the
vertebrates
in
the
dim
laurentian
seas
that
wriggled
without
knowing
why
they
wriggled
swimming
without
knowing
where
they
were
going
that
come
along
up
by
degrees
through
millions
of
ages
through
all
that
crawls
and
swims
and
floats
and
runs
and
growls
and
barks
and
howls
until
it
struck
this
fellow
in
the
and
then
that
fellow
in
the
dugout
getting
a
little
grander
and
each
one
below
calling
every
one
above
him
a
heretic
calling
every
one
who
had
made
a
little
advance
an
infidel
or
an
atheist
and
finally
the
heads
getting
a
little
higher
and
looming
up
a
little
grander
and
more
splendidly
and
finally
produced
shakespeare
who
harvested
all
the
field
of
dramatic
thought
and
from
whose
day
until
now
there
have
been
none
but
gleaners
of
chaff
and
straw
shakespeare
was
an
intellectual
ocean
whose
waves
touched
all
the
shores
of
human
thought
within
which
were
all
the
tides
and
currents
and
pulses
upon
which
lay
all
the
lights
and
shadows
and
over
which
brooded
all
the
calms
and
swept
all
the
storms
and
tempests
of
which
the
soul
is
capable
i
would
rather
belong
to
that
race
that
commenced
with
that
vertebrate
that
produced
shakespeare
a
race
that
has
before
it
an
infinite
future
with
the
angel
of
progress
leaning
from
the
far
horizon
beckoning
men
forward
and
upward
forever
i
would
rather
belong
to
that
race
than
to
have
descended
from
a
perfect
pair
upon
which
the
lord
has
lost
money
every
moment
from
that
day
to
this
now
my
crime
has
been
this
i
have
insisted
that
the
bible
is
not
the
word
of
god
i
have
insisted
that
we
should
not
whip
our
children
i
have
insisted
that
we
should
treat
our
wives
as
loving
equals
i
have
denied
that
god
if
there
is
any
god
ever
upheld
polygamy
and
slavery
i
have
denied
that
that
god
ever
told
his
generals
to
kill
innocent
babes
and
tear
and
rip
open
women
with
the
sword
of
war
i
have
denied
that
and
for
that
i
have
been
assailed
by
the
clergy
of
the
united
states
they
tell
me
i
have
misquoted
and
i
owe
it
to
you
and
maybe
i
owe
it
to
myself
to
read
one
or
two
words
to
you
upon
this
subject
in
order
to
do
that
i
shall
have
to
put
on
my
glasses
and
that
brings
me
back
to
where
i
started
that
man
has
advanced
just
in
proportion
as
his
thought
has
mingled
with
his
labor
if
man
eyes
had
failed
he
would
never
have
made
any
spectacles
he
would
never
have
had
the
telescope
and
he
would
never
have
been
able
to
read
the
leaves
of
heaven
ingersoll
reply
to
collyer
now
they
tell
me
and
there
are
several
gentlemen
who
have
spoken
on
this
subject
the
rev
collyer
a
gentleman
standing
as
high
as
anybody
and
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
him
because
i
denounced
god
who
upheld
murder
and
slavery
and
polygamy
he
said
that
what
i
said
was
slang
i
would
like
to
have
it
compared
with
any
sermon
that
ever
issued
from
the
lips
of
that
gentleman
and
before
he
gets
through
he
admits
that
the
old
testament
is
a
rotten
tree
that
will
soon
fall
into
the
earth
and
act
as
a
fertilizer
for
his
doctrine
is
it
honest
in
that
man
to
assail
my
motive
let
him
answer
my
argument
is
it
honest
and
fair
in
him
to
say
i
am
doing
a
certain
thing
because
it
is
popular
has
it
got
to
this
that
in
this
christian
country
where
they
have
preached
every
day
hundreds
and
thousands
of
sermons
has
it
got
to
this
that
infidelity
is
so
popular
in
the
united
states
if
it
has
i
take
courage
and
i
not
only
see
the
dawn
of
a
brighter
day
but
the
day
is
here
think
of
it
a
minister
tells
me
in
this
year
of
grace
that
a
man
is
an
infidel
simply
that
he
may
be
popular
i
am
glad
of
it
simply
that
he
may
make
money
is
it
possible
that
we
can
make
more
money
tearing
up
churches
than
in
building
them
up
is
it
possible
that
we
can
make
more
money
denouncing
the
god
of
slavery
than
we
can
praising
the
god
that
took
liberty
from
man
if
so
i
am
glad
i
call
publicly
upon
robert
collyer
a
man
for
whom
i
have
great
respect
i
call
publicly
upon
robert
collyer
to
state
to
the
people
of
this
city
whether
he
believes
the
old
testament
was
inspired
i
call
upon
him
to
state
whether
he
believes
that
god
ever
upheld
these
institutions
whether
god
was
a
polygamist
whether
he
believes
that
god
commanded
moses
or
joshua
or
any
one
else
to
slay
little
children
in
the
cradle
do
you
believe
that
robert
collyer
would
obey
such
an
order
do
you
believe
that
he
would
rush
to
the
cradle
and
drive
the
knife
of
theological
hatred
to
the
tender
heart
of
a
dimpled
child
and
yet
when
i
denounce
a
god
that
will
give
such
a
hellish
order
he
says
it
is
slang
i
want
him
to
answer
and
when
he
answers
he
will
say
he
does
not
believe
the
bible
is
inspired
that
is
what
he
will
say
and
he
holds
these
old
worthies
in
the
same
contempt
that
i
do
suppose
he
should
act
like
abraham
suppose
he
should
send
some
woman
out
into
the
wilderness
with
his
child
in
her
arms
to
starve
would
he
think
that
mankind
ought
to
hold
up
his
name
forever
for
reverence
robert
collyer
says
that
we
should
read
and
scan
every
word
of
the
old
testament
with
reverence
that
we
should
take
this
book
up
with
reverential
hands
i
deny
it
we
should
read
it
as
we
do
every
other
book
and
everything
good
in
it
keep
it
and
everything
that
shocks
the
brain
and
shocks
the
heart
throw
it
away
let
us
be
honest
ingersoll
reply
to
prof
swing
prof
swing
has
made
a
few
remarks
on
this
subject
and
i
say
the
spirit
he
has
exhibited
has
been
as
gentle
and
as
sweet
as
the
perfume
of
a
flower
he
was
too
good
a
man
to
stay
in
the
presbyterian
church
he
was
a
rose
among
thistles
he
was
a
dove
among
vultures
and
they
hunted
him
out
and
i
am
glad
he
came
out
i
tell
all
the
churches
to
drive
all
such
men
out
and
when
he
comes
i
want
him
to
state
just
what
he
thinks
i
want
him
to
tell
the
people
of
chicago
whether
he
believes
the
bible
is
inspired
in
any
sense
except
that
in
which
shakespeare
was
inspired
honor
bright
i
tell
you
that
all
the
sweet
and
beautiful
things
in
the
bible
would
not
make
one
play
of
shakespeare
all
the
philosophy
in
the
world
would
not
make
one
scene
in
hamlet
all
the
beauties
of
the
bible
would
not
make
one
scene
in
the
midsummer
night
dream
all
the
beautiful
things
about
woman
in
the
bible
would
not
begin
to
create
such
a
character
as
perditu
or
imogene
or
miranda
not
one
i
want
him
to
tell
whether
he
believes
the
bible
was
inspired
in
any
other
way
than
shakespeare
was
inspired
i
want
him
to
pick
out
something
as
beautiful
and
tender
as
burns
poem
to
mary
in
heaven
i
want
him
to
tell
whether
he
believes
the
story
about
the
bears
eating
up
children
whether
that
is
inspired
i
want
him
to
tell
whether
he
considers
that
a
poem
or
not
i
want
to
know
if
the
same
god
made
those
bears
that
devoured
the
children
because
they
laughed
at
an
old
man
out
of
hair
i
want
to
know
if
the
same
god
that
did
that
is
the
same
god
who
said
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me
for
such
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
i
want
him
to
answer
it
and
answer
it
fairly
that
is
all
i
ask
i
want
just
the
fair
thing
now
sometimes
mr
swing
talks
as
though
he
believed
the
bible
and
then
he
talks
to
me
as
though
he
did
believe
the
bible
the
day
he
made
this
sermon
i
think
he
did
just
a
little
believe
it
he
is
like
the
man
that
passed
a
ten
dollar
counterfeit
bill
he
was
arrested
and
his
father
went
to
see
him
and
said
john
how
could
you
commit
such
a
crime
how
could
you
bring
my
gray
hairs
in
sorrow
to
the
grave
well
he
says
father
i
tell
you
i
got
this
bill
and
some
days
i
thought
it
was
bad
and
some
days
i
thought
it
was
good
and
one
day
when
i
thought
it
was
good
i
passed
it
i
want
it
distinctly
understood
that
i
have
the
greatest
respect
for
prof
swing
but
i
want
him
to
tell
whether
the
psalm
is
inspired
i
want
him
to
tell
whether
the
passages
i
shall
afterward
read
in
this
book
are
inspired
that
is
what
i
want
ingersoll
reply
to
brooke
herford
then
there
is
another
gentleman
here
his
name
is
herford
he
says
it
is
not
fair
to
apply
the
test
of
truth
to
the
bible
i
do
think
it
is
myself
he
says
although
moses
upheld
slavery
that
he
improved
it
they
were
not
quite
so
bad
as
they
were
before
and
heaven
justified
slavery
at
that
time
do
you
believe
that
god
ever
turned
the
arms
of
children
into
chains
of
slavery
do
you
believe
that
god
ever
said
to
a
man
you
ca
have
your
wife
unless
you
will
be
a
slave
you
can
not
have
your
children
unless
you
will
lose
your
liberty
and
unless
you
are
willing
to
throw
them
from
your
heart
forever
you
can
not
be
free
i
want
herford
to
state
whether
he
loves
such
a
god
be
honor
bright
about
it
do
begin
to
talk
about
civilization
or
what
the
church
has
done
or
will
do
just
walk
right
up
to
the
rack
and
say
whether
you
love
and
worship
a
god
that
established
slavery
honest
and
love
and
worship
a
god
that
would
allow
a
little
babe
to
be
torn
from
the
breast
of
its
mother
and
sold
into
slavery
now
tell
it
fair
herford
i
want
you
to
tell
the
ladies
in
your
congregation
that
you
believe
in
a
god
that
allowed
women
to
be
given
to
the
soldiers
tell
them
that
and
then
if
you
say
it
was
not
the
god
of
moses
then
do
praise
moses
any
more
do
do
it
answer
these
questions
ingersoll
gatling
gun
turned
on
ryder
then
here
is
another
gentleman
ryder
the
rev
ryder
and
he
says
that
calvinism
is
rejected
by
a
majority
of
christendom
he
is
mistaken
there
is
what
they
call
the
evangelical
alliance
they
met
in
this
country
in
or
and
there
were
present
representatives
of
all
the
evangelical
churches
in
the
world
and
they
adopted
a
creed
and
that
creed
is
that
man
is
totally
depraved
that
creed
is
that
there
is
an
eternal
universal
hell
and
that
every
man
that
does
not
believe
in
a
certain
way
is
bound
to
be
damned
forever
and
that
there
is
only
one
way
to
be
saved
and
that
is
by
faith
and
by
faith
alone
and
they
would
not
allow
anybody
to
be
represented
there
that
did
not
believe
that
and
they
would
not
allow
a
unitarian
there
and
would
not
have
allowed
ryder
there
because
he
takes
away
from
the
christian
world
the
consolation
naturally
arising
from
the
belief
in
hell
ryder
is
mistaken
all
the
orthodox
religion
of
the
day
is
calvinism
it
believes
in
the
fall
of
man
it
believes
in
the
atonement
it
believes
in
the
eternity
of
hell
and
it
believes
in
salvation
by
faith
that
is
to
say
by
credulity
that
is
what
they
believe
and
he
is
mistaken
and
i
want
to
tell
kyder
today
if
there
is
a
god
and
he
wrote
the
old
testament
there
is
a
hell
the
god
that
wrote
the
old
testament
will
have
a
hell
and
i
want
to
tell
ryder
another
thing
that
the
bible
teaches
an
eternity
of
punishment
i
want
to
tell
him
that
the
bible
upholds
the
doctrine
of
hell
i
want
to
tell
him
that
if
there
is
no
hell
somebody
ought
to
have
said
so
and
jesus
christ
should
not
have
said
i
will
at
the
last
day
say
from
me
ye
cursed
into
everlasting
fire
prepared
for
the
devil
and
his
angels
if
there
was
not
such
a
place
christ
would
not
have
said
depart
from
me
ye
cursed
and
these
shall
go
hence
into
everlasting
fire
and
if
you
ryder
are
depending
for
salvation
on
the
god
that
wrote
the
old
testament
you
will
inevitably
be
eternally
damned
there
is
no
hope
for
you
it
is
just
as
bad
to
deny
hell
as
it
is
to
deny
heaven
it
is
just
as
much
blasphemy
to
deny
the
devil
as
to
deny
god
according
to
the
orthodox
creed
he
admits
that
the
jews
were
polygamists
but
he
says
how
was
it
they
finally
quit
it
i
can
tell
you
the
soil
was
so
poor
they
could
afford
it
prof
swing
says
the
bible
is
a
poem
ryder
says
it
is
a
picture
the
garden
of
eden
is
pictorial
a
pictorial
snake
and
a
pictorial
woman
i
suppose
and
a
pictorial
man
and
maybe
it
was
a
pictorial
sin
and
only
a
pictorial
atonement
ingersoll
reply
to
rabbi
bien
then
there
is
another
gentleman
and
he
a
rabbi
a
rabbi
bien
or
bean
or
whatever
his
name
is
and
he
comes
to
the
defense
of
the
great
there
was
another
rabbi
who
attacked
me
in
cincinnati
and
i
could
help
but
think
of
the
old
saying
that
a
man
got
off
when
he
said
the
tallest
man
he
ever
knew
his
name
was
short
and
the
fattest
man
he
ever
saw
his
name
was
lean
and
it
is
only
necessary
for
me
to
add
that
this
rabbi
in
cincinnati
was
wise
the
rabbi
here
i
will
not
answer
him
and
i
will
tell
you
why
because
he
has
taken
himself
outside
of
all
the
limits
of
a
gentleman
because
he
has
taken
it
upon
himself
to
traduce
american
women
in
language
the
beastliest
i
ever
read
and
any
man
who
says
that
the
american
women
are
not
just
as
good
women
as
any
god
can
make
and
pick
his
mud
today
is
an
unappreciative
barbarian
i
will
let
him
alone
because
he
denounced
all
the
men
in
this
country
all
the
members
of
congress
all
the
members
of
the
senate
and
all
the
judges
upon
the
bench
in
his
lecture
he
denounced
them
as
thieves
and
robbers
that
wo
do
i
want
to
remind
him
that
in
this
country
the
jews
were
first
admitted
to
the
privileges
of
citizens
that
in
this
country
they
were
first
given
all
their
rights
and
i
am
as
much
in
favor
of
their
having
their
rights
as
i
am
in
favor
of
having
my
own
but
when
a
rabbi
so
far
forgets
himself
as
to
traduce
the
women
and
men
of
this
country
i
pronounce
him
a
vulgar
falsifier
and
let
him
alone
strange
that
nearly
every
man
that
has
answered
me
has
answered
me
mostly
on
the
same
side
strange
that
nearly
every
man
that
thought
himself
called
upon
to
defend
the
bible
was
one
who
did
not
believe
in
it
himself
is
it
strange
they
are
like
some
suspected
people
always
anxious
to
show
their
marriage
certificate
they
want
at
least
to
convince
the
world
that
they
are
not
as
bad
as
i
am
now
i
want
to
read
you
just
one
or
two
things
and
then
i
am
going
to
let
you
go
i
want
to
see
if
i
have
said
such
awful
things
and
whether
i
have
got
any
scripture
to
stand
by
me
i
will
read
only
two
or
three
verses
does
the
bible
teach
man
to
enslave
his
brother
if
it
does
it
is
not
the
word
of
god
unless
god
is
a
slaveholder
moreover
all
the
children
of
the
strangers
that
do
sojourn
among
you
of
them
shall
ye
buy
of
their
families
which
are
with
you
which
they
beget
in
your
land
and
they
shall
be
your
possession
ye
shall
take
them
as
an
inheritance
for
your
children
after
you
to
inherit
them
they
shall
be
your
bondsmen
forever
old
testament
upon
the
limbs
of
unborn
babes
this
fiendish
god
put
the
chains
of
slavery
i
hate
him
both
thy
bondmen
and
bondwomen
shall
be
of
the
heathen
round
about
thee
and
them
shall
ye
buy
bondmen
and
bondwomen
now
let
us
read
what
the
new
testament
has
i
could
read
a
great
deal
more
but
that
is
enough
servants
be
obedient
to
them
that
are
your
masters
according
to
the
flesh
in
fear
and
trembling
in
singleness
of
your
heart
as
unto
christ
this
is
putting
the
dirty
thief
that
steals
your
labor
on
an
equality
with
god
servants
be
subject
to
your
masters
with
all
fear
not
only
to
the
good
and
gentle
but
also
to
the
froward
for
this
is
thankworthy
if
a
man
for
conscience
toward
god
endure
grief
suffering
wrongfully
the
idea
of
a
man
on
account
of
conscience
toward
god
stealing
another
man
or
allowing
him
nothing
but
lashes
on
his
back
as
for
labor
performed
let
as
many
servants
as
are
under
the
yoke
count
their
own
masters
worthy
of
all
honor
that
the
name
of
god
and
his
doctrine
be
not
blasphemed
how
can
you
blaspheme
the
name
of
god
by
asserting
your
independence
how
can
you
blaspheme
the
name
of
a
god
by
striking
fetters
from
the
limbs
of
men
i
wish
some
of
your
ministers
would
tell
you
that
and
they
that
have
believing
masters
let
them
not
despise
them
that
is
to
say
a
good
christian
could
own
another
believer
in
jesus
christ
could
own
a
woman
and
her
children
and
could
sell
the
child
away
from
its
mother
that
is
a
sweet
belief
o
hypocrisy
let
them
not
despise
them
because
they
are
brethren
but
rather
do
them
service
because
they
are
faithful
and
beloved
partakers
of
the
benefit
oh
what
slush
here
is
what
they
will
tell
the
poor
slave
so
that
he
will
serve
the
man
that
stole
his
wife
and
children
from
him
for
we
brought
nothing
into
this
world
and
it
is
certain
we
can
carry
nothing
out
having
food
and
raiment
let
us
be
therewith
content
do
you
think
that
it
would
do
just
as
well
to
preach
that
to
the
thieving
man
as
to
the
suffering
slave
i
think
so
then
this
same
bible
teaches
witchcraft
that
spirits
go
into
the
bodies
of
the
man
and
pigs
and
that
god
himself
made
a
trade
with
the
devil
and
the
devil
traded
him
off
a
man
for
a
certain
number
of
swine
and
the
devil
lost
money
because
the
hogs
ran
right
down
into
the
sea
he
got
a
corner
on
that
deal
now
let
us
see
how
they
believed
in
the
rights
of
children
if
a
man
have
a
stubborn
and
rebellious
son
which
will
not
obey
the
voice
of
his
father
or
the
voice
of
his
mother
and
that
when
they
have
chastened
him
will
not
harken
unto
them
then
shall
his
father
and
his
mother
lay
hold
on
him
and
bring
him
out
unto
the
elders
of
his
city
and
unto
the
gate
of
his
place
and
they
shall
say
unto
the
elders
of
his
city
our
son
is
stubborn
and
rebellious
he
will
not
obey
our
voice
he
is
a
glutton
and
a
drunkard
and
all
the
men
of
this
city
shall
stone
him
with
stones
that
he
die
so
shalt
thou
put
evil
away
that
is
a
very
good
way
to
raise
children
here
is
the
story
of
jephthah
he
went
off
and
he
asked
the
lord
to
let
him
whip
some
people
and
he
told
the
lord
if
he
would
let
him
whip
them
he
would
sacrifice
to
the
lord
the
first
thing
that
met
him
on
his
return
and
the
first
thing
that
met
him
was
his
own
beautiful
daughter
and
he
sacrificed
her
is
there
a
sadder
story
in
all
history
than
that
what
do
you
think
of
a
man
that
would
sacrifice
his
own
daughter
what
do
you
think
of
a
god
that
would
receive
that
sacrifice
now
then
they
come
to
women
in
this
blessed
gospel
and
let
us
see
what
the
gospel
says
about
women
then
you
ought
all
to
go
to
church
girls
next
sunday
and
hear
it
let
the
woman
learn
in
silence
with
all
subjection
but
i
suffer
not
a
woman
to
teach
nor
to
usurp
authority
over
the
man
but
to
be
in
silence
for
adam
was
formed
first
not
eve
do
you
see
and
adam
was
not
deceived
but
the
woman
being
deceived
was
in
the
transgression
notwithstanding
she
shall
be
saved
in
if
they
continue
in
faith
and
charity
and
holiness
with
sobriety
that
is
mr
timothy
but
i
would
have
you
know
that
the
head
of
every
man
is
christ
and
the
head
of
the
woman
is
the
man
and
the
head
of
christ
is
god
i
suppose
that
every
old
maid
is
acephalous
for
a
man
indeed
ought
not
to
cover
his
head
for
as
much
as
he
is
the
image
and
glory
of
god
but
the
woman
is
the
glory
of
the
man
for
the
man
is
not
of
the
woman
but
woman
of
the
man
neither
was
the
man
created
for
the
woman
but
the
woman
for
the
man
wives
submit
yourselves
unto
your
own
husband
as
unto
the
lord
for
the
husband
is
the
head
of
the
wife
even
as
christ
is
the
head
of
the
church
do
you
hear
that
you
did
know
how
much
we
were
above
you
when
you
go
back
to
the
old
testament
to
the
great
you
find
that
the
woman
has
to
ask
forgiveness
for
having
borne
a
child
if
it
was
a
boy
days
she
was
unclean
if
it
was
a
girl
nice
laws
good
laws
if
there
is
a
pure
thing
in
this
world
if
there
is
a
picture
of
perfect
purity
it
is
a
mother
with
her
child
in
her
arms
yes
i
think
more
of
a
good
woman
and
a
child
than
i
do
of
all
the
gods
i
have
ever
heard
these
people
tell
about
just
think
of
this
when
thou
goest
forth
to
war
against
thine
enemies
and
the
lord
thy
god
hath
delivered
them
into
thine
hands
and
thou
hast
taken
them
captive
and
seest
among
the
captives
a
beautiful
woman
and
hast
a
desire
unto
her
that
thou
wouldst
have
her
to
thy
wife
then
thou
shalt
bring
her
home
to
thine
house
and
she
shall
shave
her
head
and
pare
her
nails
wherefore
ye
must
needs
be
subject
not
only
for
wrath
but
for
conscience
sake
for
this
cause
pay
you
tribute
also
for
they
are
god
ministers
i
despise
this
wretched
doctrine
wherever
the
sword
of
rebellion
is
drawn
in
favor
of
the
right
i
am
a
rebel
i
suppose
alexander
czar
of
russia
was
put
there
by
the
order
of
god
was
he
i
am
sorry
he
was
not
removed
by
the
nihilist
that
shot
at
him
the
other
day
i
tell
you
in
a
country
like
that
where
there
are
hundreds
of
girls
not
years
of
age
prisoners
in
siberia
simply
for
giving
their
ideas
about
liberty
and
we
telegraphed
to
that
country
congratulating
that
wretch
that
he
was
not
killed
my
heart
goes
into
the
prison
my
heart
goes
with
the
poor
girl
working
as
a
miner
in
the
mines
crawling
on
her
hands
and
knees
getting
the
precious
ore
out
of
the
mines
and
my
sympathies
go
with
her
and
my
sympathies
cluster
around
the
point
of
the
dagger
does
the
bible
describe
a
god
of
mercy
let
me
read
you
a
verse
or
two
i
will
make
mine
arrows
drunk
with
blood
and
my
sword
shall
devour
flesh
thy
foot
may
be
dipped
in
the
blood
of
thine
enemies
and
the
tongue
of
thy
dogs
in
the
same
and
the
lord
thy
god
will
put
out
those
nations
before
thee
by
little
and
little
thou
mayest
not
consume
them
at
once
lest
the
beasts
of
the
field
increase
upon
thee
but
the
lord
thy
god
shall
deliver
them
unto
thee
and
shall
destroy
them
with
a
mighty
destruction
until
they
be
destroyed
and
he
shall
deliver
their
kings
into
thine
hand
and
thou
shalt
destroy
their
name
from
under
heaven
there
shall
no
man
be
able
to
stand
before
thee
until
thou
have
destroyed
them
i
can
see
what
he
had
her
nails
pared
for
does
the
bible
teach
polygamy
the
rev
newman
consul
general
to
all
the
world
had
a
discussion
with
elder
heber
of
kimball
or
some
such
wretch
in
utah
whether
the
bible
sustains
polygamy
and
the
mormons
have
printed
that
discussion
as
a
campaign
document
read
the
order
of
moses
in
the
chapter
of
numbers
a
great
many
chapters
i
dare
not
read
to
you
they
are
too
filthy
i
leave
all
that
to
the
clergy
read
the
chapter
of
exodus
the
chapter
of
deuteronomy
the
life
of
abraham
and
the
life
of
david
and
the
life
of
solomon
and
then
tell
me
that
the
bible
does
not
uphold
polygamy
and
concubinage
let
them
answer
then
i
said
that
the
bible
upheld
tyranny
let
me
read
you
a
little
let
every
soul
be
subject
unto
the
higher
powers
for
there
is
no
power
but
of
god
the
powers
that
be
are
ordained
of
god
george
iii
was
king
by
the
grace
of
god
and
when
our
fathers
rose
in
rebellion
according
to
this
doctrine
they
rose
against
the
power
of
god
and
if
they
did
they
were
successful
and
so
it
goes
on
telling
of
all
the
cities
that
were
destroyed
and
of
the
men
that
they
dashed
their
brains
out
and
all
the
little
babes
and
all
the
sweet
women
that
they
killed
and
plundered
all
in
the
name
of
a
most
merciful
god
well
think
of
it
the
old
testament
is
filled
with
anathemas
and
with
curses
and
with
words
of
revenge
and
jealousy
and
hatred
and
meanness
and
brutality
have
i
read
enough
to
show
that
what
i
said
is
so
i
think
i
have
i
wish
i
had
time
to
read
to
you
further
of
what
the
dear
old
fathers
of
the
church
said
about
woman
wait
a
minute
and
i
will
read
you
a
little
we
have
got
them
running
augustine
in
his
book
says
a
woman
ought
to
serve
her
husband
as
unto
god
affirming
that
woman
ought
to
be
braced
and
bridled
betimes
if
she
aspire
to
any
dominion
alleging
that
dangerous
and
perilous
it
is
to
suffer
her
to
precede
although
it
be
in
temporal
and
corporeal
things
how
can
woman
be
in
the
image
of
god
seeing
she
is
subject
to
man
and
hath
no
authority
to
teach
neither
to
be
a
witness
neither
to
judge
much
less
to
rule
or
bear
the
rod
of
empire
oh
he
is
a
good
one
these
are
the
very
words
of
augustine
let
me
read
some
more
woman
shall
be
subject
unto
man
as
unto
christ
that
is
augustine
and
this
sentence
of
augustine
ought
to
be
noted
of
all
women
for
in
it
he
plainly
affirms
that
women
are
all
the
more
subject
to
man
and
now
ambrose
he
is
a
good
boy
adam
was
deceived
by
eve
called
heva
and
not
heva
by
adam
and
therefore
just
it
is
that
woman
receive
and
acknowledge
him
for
governor
whom
she
called
sin
lest
that
again
she
slip
and
fall
with
womanly
facility
do
you
see
that
woman
has
sinned
once
and
man
never
if
you
give
woman
an
opportunity
she
will
sin
again
whereas
if
you
give
it
to
man
who
never
never
betrayed
his
trust
in
the
world
nothing
bad
can
happen
let
women
be
subject
to
their
own
husbands
as
unto
the
lord
for
man
is
the
head
of
woman
and
christ
is
the
head
of
the
congregation
they
are
all
real
good
men
all
of
them
it
is
not
permitted
to
woman
to
speak
let
her
be
in
silence
as
the
law
said
unto
thy
husband
shalt
thou
ever
be
and
he
shall
bear
dominion
over
thee
so
chrysostom
he
is
another
good
man
woman
he
says
was
put
under
the
power
of
man
and
man
was
pronounced
lord
over
her
that
she
should
obey
man
that
the
head
should
not
follow
the
feet
false
priests
do
commonly
deceive
women
because
they
are
easily
persuaded
to
any
opinion
especially
if
it
be
again
given
and
because
they
lack
prudence
and
right
reason
to
judge
the
things
that
be
spoken
which
should
not
be
the
nature
of
those
that
are
appointed
to
govern
others
for
they
should
be
constant
stable
prudent
and
doing
everything
with
discretion
and
reason
which
virtues
woman
can
not
have
in
equality
with
man
i
tell
you
women
are
more
prudent
than
men
i
tell
you
as
a
rule
women
are
more
truthful
than
men
i
tell
you
that
women
are
more
faithful
than
men
ten
times
as
faithful
as
man
i
never
saw
a
man
pursue
his
wife
into
the
very
ditch
and
dust
of
degradation
and
take
her
in
his
arms
i
never
saw
a
man
stand
at
the
shore
where
she
had
been
morally
wrecked
waiting
for
the
waves
to
bring
back
even
her
corpse
to
his
arms
but
i
have
seen
woman
do
it
i
have
seen
woman
with
her
white
arms
lift
man
from
the
mire
of
degradation
and
hold
him
to
her
bosom
as
though
he
were
an
angel
and
these
men
thought
woman
not
fit
to
be
held
as
pure
in
the
sight
of
god
as
man
i
never
saw
a
man
that
pretended
that
he
did
love
a
woman
that
pretended
that
he
loved
god
better
than
he
did
a
woman
that
he
did
look
hateful
to
me
hateful
and
unclean
i
could
read
you
twenty
others
but
i
have
time
to
do
it
they
are
all
to
the
same
effect
exactly
they
hate
woman
and
say
man
is
as
much
above
her
as
god
is
above
man
i
am
a
believer
in
absolute
equality
i
am
a
believer
in
absolute
liberty
between
man
and
wife
i
believe
in
liberty
and
i
say
oh
liberty
float
not
forever
in
the
far
horizon
remain
not
forever
in
the
dream
of
the
enthusiast
the
philanthropist
and
poet
but
come
and
make
thy
home
among
the
children
of
men
i
know
not
what
discoveries
what
inventions
what
thoughts
may
leap
from
the
brain
of
the
world
i
know
not
what
garments
of
glory
may
be
woven
by
the
years
to
come
i
can
not
dream
of
the
victories
to
be
won
i
do
know
that
coming
upon
the
field
of
thought
but
down
the
infinite
sea
of
the
future
there
will
never
touch
this
bank
and
shoal
of
time
a
richer
gift
a
rarer
blessing
than
liberty
for
man
woman
and
child
i
never
addressed
a
more
magnificent
audience
in
my
life
and
i
thank
you
i
thank
you
a
thousand
times
over
ingersoll
catechism
and
nothing
is
more
gratifying
than
to
see
ideas
that
were
received
with
scorn
flourishing
in
the
sunshine
of
approval
only
a
few
weeks
ago
i
stated
that
the
bible
was
not
inspired
that
moses
was
mistaken
that
the
flood
was
a
foolish
myth
that
the
tower
of
babel
existed
only
in
credulity
that
god
did
not
create
the
universe
from
nothing
that
he
did
not
start
the
first
woman
with
a
rib
that
he
never
upheld
slavery
that
he
was
not
a
polygamist
that
he
did
not
kill
people
for
making
that
he
did
not
order
his
generals
to
kill
the
dimpled
babes
that
he
did
not
allow
the
roses
of
love
and
the
violets
of
modesty
to
be
trodden
under
the
brutal
feet
of
lust
that
the
hebrew
language
was
written
without
vowels
that
the
bible
was
composed
of
many
books
written
by
unknown
men
that
all
translations
differed
from
each
other
and
that
this
book
had
filled
the
world
with
agony
and
crime
at
that
time
i
had
not
the
remotest
idea
that
the
most
learned
clergymen
in
chicago
would
substantially
agree
with
me
in
public
i
have
read
the
replies
of
the
rev
robert
collyer
thomas
rabbi
kohler
rev
brooke
herford
prof
swing
and
ryder
and
will
now
ask
them
a
few
questions
answering
them
in
their
own
words
first
rev
robert
collyer
question
what
is
your
opinion
of
the
bible
answer
it
is
a
splendid
book
it
makes
the
noblest
type
of
catholics
and
the
meanest
bigots
through
this
book
men
give
their
hearts
for
good
to
god
or
for
evil
to
the
devil
the
best
argument
for
the
intrinsic
greatness
of
the
book
is
that
it
can
touch
such
wide
extremes
and
seem
to
maintain
us
in
the
most
unparalleled
cruelty
as
well
as
the
most
tender
mercy
that
it
can
inspire
purity
like
that
of
the
great
saints
and
afford
arguments
in
favor
of
polygamy
the
bible
is
the
text
book
of
ironclad
calvinism
and
sunny
universalism
it
makes
the
quaker
quiet
and
the
millerite
crazy
it
inspired
the
union
soldier
to
live
and
grandly
die
for
the
right
and
stonewall
jackson
to
live
nobly
and
die
grandly
for
the
wrong
q
but
collyer
do
you
really
think
that
a
book
with
as
many
passages
in
favor
of
wrong
as
right
is
inspired
i
look
upon
the
old
testament
as
a
rotting
tree
when
it
falls
it
will
fertilize
a
bank
of
violets
q
do
you
believe
that
god
upheld
slavery
and
polygamy
do
you
believe
that
he
ordered
the
killing
of
babes
and
the
violation
of
maidens
a
there
is
inspiration
in
the
bible
the
first
peerless
and
perfect
the
word
of
god
to
man
the
second
simply
and
purely
human
and
then
below
this
again
there
is
an
inspiration
born
of
an
evil
heart
ruthless
and
savage
there
and
then
as
anything
well
can
be
a
inspiration
of
heaven
first
then
of
the
earth
and
then
of
hell
all
in
the
same
book
all
sometimes
in
the
same
chapter
and
then
besides
a
great
many
things
that
need
no
inspiration
q
then
after
all
you
do
not
pretend
that
the
scriptures
are
really
inspired
a
the
scriptures
make
no
such
claim
for
themselves
as
the
church
make
for
them
they
leave
me
free
to
say
this
is
false
or
this
is
true
the
truth
even
within
the
bible
dies
and
lives
makes
on
this
side
and
loses
on
that
q
what
do
you
say
to
the
last
verse
in
the
bible
where
a
curse
is
threatened
to
any
man
who
takes
from
or
adds
to
the
book
a
i
have
but
one
answer
to
this
question
and
it
is
let
who
will
have
written
this
i
can
not
for
an
instant
believe
that
it
was
written
by
a
divine
inspiration
such
dogmas
and
threats
as
these
are
not
of
god
but
of
man
and
not
of
any
man
of
a
free
spirit
and
heart
eager
for
the
truth
but
a
narrow
man
who
would
cripple
and
confine
the
human
soul
in
its
quest
after
the
whole
truth
of
god
and
back
those
who
have
done
the
shameful
things
in
the
name
of
the
most
high
q
do
you
not
regard
such
talk
as
slang
supposed
answer
if
an
infidel
had
said
that
the
writer
of
revelations
was
narrow
and
bigoted
i
might
have
denounced
his
discourse
as
slang
but
i
think
that
unitarian
ministers
can
do
so
with
the
greatest
propriety
q
do
you
believe
in
the
stories
of
the
bible
about
jael
and
the
sun
standing
still
and
the
walls
falling
at
the
blowing
of
horns
a
they
may
be
legends
myths
poems
or
what
they
will
but
they
are
not
the
word
of
god
so
i
say
again
it
was
not
the
god
and
father
of
us
all
who
inspired
the
woman
to
drive
that
nail
crashing
through
the
king
temple
after
she
had
given
him
that
bowl
of
milk
and
bid
him
sleep
in
safety
but
a
very
mean
devil
of
hatred
and
revenge
that
i
should
hardly
expect
to
find
in
a
squaw
on
the
plains
it
was
not
the
ram
horns
and
the
shouting
before
which
the
walls
fell
flat
if
they
went
down
at
all
it
was
through
good
solid
pounding
and
not
for
an
instant
did
the
steady
sun
stand
still
or
let
his
planet
stand
still
while
barbarian
fought
barbarian
he
kept
just
the
time
then
he
keeps
now
they
might
believe
it
who
made
the
record
i
do
not
and
since
the
whole
christian
world
might
believe
it
still
we
do
not
who
gather
in
this
church
a
free
and
reasonable
mind
stands
right
in
our
way
newton
might
believe
it
as
a
christian
and
disbelieve
it
as
a
philosopher
we
stand
then
with
the
philosopher
against
the
christian
for
we
must
believe
what
is
true
to
us
in
the
last
test
and
these
things
are
not
true
second
rev
thomas
question
what
is
your
opinion
of
the
old
testament
answer
my
opinion
is
that
it
is
not
one
book
but
many
books
bound
up
in
one
the
date
and
authorship
of
most
of
these
books
are
wholly
unknown
the
hebrews
wrote
without
vowels
and
without
dividing
the
letters
into
syllables
words
or
sentences
the
books
were
gathered
up
by
ezra
at
that
time
only
two
of
the
jewish
tribes
remained
all
progress
had
ceased
in
gathering
up
the
sacred
book
copyists
exercised
great
liberty
in
making
changes
and
additions
q
yes
we
know
all
that
but
is
the
old
testament
inspired
a
there
maybe
the
inspiration
of
art
of
poetry
or
oratory
of
patriotism
and
there
are
such
inspirations
there
are
moments
when
great
truths
and
principles
come
to
men
they
seek
the
man
and
not
the
man
them
q
yes
we
will
admit
that
but
is
the
bible
inspired
a
but
still
i
know
of
no
way
to
convince
any
one
of
spirit
and
inspiration
and
god
only
as
his
reason
may
take
hold
of
these
things
q
do
you
think
the
old
testament
true
a
the
story
of
eden
may
be
an
allegory
the
history
of
the
children
of
israel
may
have
mistakes
q
must
inspiration
claim
infallibility
a
it
is
a
mistake
to
say
that
if
you
believe
one
part
of
the
bible
you
must
believe
all
some
of
the
books
may
be
inspired
others
not
or
there
may
be
degrees
of
inspiration
q
do
you
believe
that
god
commanded
the
soldiers
to
kill
the
children
and
the
married
women
and
save
for
themselves
the
maidens
as
recorded
in
numbers
do
you
believe
that
god
upheld
slavery
do
you
believe
that
god
upheld
polygamy
a
the
bible
may
be
wrong
in
some
statements
god
and
right
can
not
be
wrong
we
must
not
exalt
the
bible
above
god
it
may
be
that
we
have
claimed
too
much
for
the
bible
and
thereby
given
not
a
little
occasion
for
such
men
as
ingersoll
to
appear
at
the
other
extreme
denying
too
much
q
what
then
shall
be
done
a
we
must
take
a
middle
ground
it
is
not
necessary
to
believe
that
the
bears
devoured
the
children
nor
that
jonah
was
swallowed
by
the
whale
third
rev
kohler
question
what
is
your
opinion
about
the
old
testament
answer
i
will
not
make
futile
attempts
of
artificially
interpreting
the
letter
of
the
bible
so
as
to
make
it
reflect
the
philosophical
moral
and
scientific
views
of
our
time
the
bible
is
a
sacred
record
of
humanity
childhood
q
are
you
an
orthodox
christian
a
no
orthodoxy
with
its
face
turned
backward
to
a
ruined
temple
or
a
dead
messiah
is
fast
becoming
like
lot
wife
a
pillar
of
salt
q
do
you
really
believe
the
old
testament
was
inspired
a
i
greatly
acknowledge
our
indebtedness
to
men
like
voltaire
and
thomas
paine
whose
bold
denial
and
cutting
wit
were
so
instrumental
in
bringing
about
this
glorious
era
of
freedom
so
congenial
and
blissful
particularly
to
the
jewish
race
q
do
you
believe
in
the
inspiration
of
the
bible
a
of
course
there
is
a
destructive
ax
needed
to
strike
down
the
old
building
in
order
to
make
room
for
the
grander
new
the
divine
origin
claimed
by
the
hebrews
for
their
national
literature
was
claimed
by
all
nations
for
their
old
records
and
laws
as
preserved
by
the
priesthood
as
moses
the
hebrew
law
giver
is
represented
as
having
received
the
law
from
god
on
the
holy
mountains
so
is
zoroaster
the
persian
manu
the
hindoo
minos
the
cretan
lycurgus
the
spartan
and
numa
the
roman
q
do
you
believe
all
the
stories
in
the
bible
a
all
that
can
and
must
be
said
against
them
is
that
they
have
been
too
long
retained
around
the
arms
and
limbs
of
manhood
to
check
the
spiritual
progress
of
religion
that
by
jewish
ritualism
and
christian
dogmatism
they
became
fetters
unto
the
soul
turning
the
light
of
heaven
into
a
misty
haze
to
blind
the
eye
and
even
into
a
hell
fire
of
fanaticism
to
consume
souls
q
is
the
bible
inspired
a
true
the
bible
is
not
free
from
errors
nor
is
any
work
of
man
and
time
it
abounds
in
childish
views
and
offensive
matters
i
trust
it
will
in
a
time
not
far
off
be
presented
for
common
use
in
families
schools
synagogues
and
churches
in
a
refined
shape
cleansed
from
all
dross
and
chaff
and
on
which

dwell
fourth
rev
herford
question
is
the
bible
true
answer
ingersoll
is
very
fond
of
saying
question
is
not
is
the
bible
inspired
but
is
it
true
that
sounds
very
plausible
but
you
know
as
applied
to
any
ancient
book
it
is
simply
nonsense
q
do
you
think
the
stories
in
the
bible
exaggerated
a
i
dare
say
the
numbers
are
immensely
exaggerated
q
do
you
think
that
god
upheld
polygamy
a
the
truth
of
which
simply
is
that
four
thousand
years
ago
polygamy
existed
among
the
jews
as
everywhere
else
on
earth
then
and
even
their
prophets
did
not
come
to
the
idea
of
its
being
wrong
but
what
is
there
to
be
indignant
about
in
that
and
so
you
really
wonder
why
any
man
should
be
indignant
at
the
idea
that
god
upheld
and
sanctioned
that
beastliness
called
polygamy
what
is
there
to
be
indignant
about
in
that
fifth
prof
swing
question
what
is
your
idea
of
the
bible
answer
i
think
it
a
poem
sixth
rev
ryder
question
and
what
is
your
idea
of
the
sacred
scriptures
answer
like
other
nations
the
hebrews
had
their
patriotic
descriptive
didactic
and
lyrical
poems
in
the
same
varieties
as
other
nations
but
with
them
unlike
other
nations
whatever
may
be
the
form
of
their
poetry
it
always
possesses
the
characteristic
of
religion
i
suppose
you
fully
appreciate
the
religious
characteristics
of
the
song
of
solomon
no
answer
q
does
the
bible
uphold
polygamy
a
the
law
of
moses
did
not
forbid
it
but
contained
many
provisions
against
its
worst
abuses
and
such
as
were
intended
to
restrict
it
within
narrow
limits
q
so
you
think
god
corrected
some
of
the
worst
abuses
of
polygamy
but
preserved
the
institution
itself
i
might
question
many
others
but
have
concluded
not
to
consider
those
as
members
of
my
bible
class
who
deal
in
calumnies
and
epithets
from
the
replies
of
such
ministers
it
appears
that
while
christianity
changes
the
heart
it
does
not
improve
the
manners
and
one
can
get
into
heaven
in
the
next
world
without
having
been
a
gentleman
in
this
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
express
the
deep
and
thrilling
satisfaction
i
have
experienced
in
reading
the
admissions
of
the
clergy
of
chicago
surely
the
battle
of
intellectual
liberty
is
almost
won
when
ministers
admit
that
the
bible
is
filled
with
ignorant
and
cruel
mistakes
that
each
man
has
the
right
to
think
for
himself
and
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
believe
the
scriptures
in
order
to
be
saved
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
congratulate
my
pupils
on
the
advance
they
have
made
and
hope
soon
to
meet
them

there
was
a
jewish
gentleman
went
into
a
restaurant
to
get
his
dinner
and
the
devil
of
temptation
whispered
in
his
ear
eat
some
bacon
he
knew
if
there
was
anything
in
the
universe
calculated
to
excite
the
wrath
of
the
infinite
being
who
made
every
shining
star
it
was
to
see
a
gentleman
eating
bacon
he
knew
it
and
he
knew
the
infinite
being
was
looking
and
that
he
was
the
infinite
of
the
universe
but
his
appetite
got
the
better
of
his
conscience
as
it
often
has
with
us
all
and
he
ate
that
bacon
he
knew
it
was
wrong
when
he
went
into
that
restaurant
the
weather
was
delightful
the
sky
was
as
blue
as
june
and
when
he
came
out
the
sky
was
covered
with
angry
clouds
the
lightning
leaping
from
one
to
the
other
and
the
earth
shaking
beneath
the
voice
of
the
thunder
he
went
back
into
that
restaurant
with
a
face
as
white
as
milk
and
he
said
to
one
of
the
keepers
my
god
did
you
ever
hear
such
a
fuss
about
a
little
piece
of
bacon
as
long
as
we
harbor
such
opinions
of
infinity
as
long
as
we
imagine
the
heavens
to
be
filled
with
such
tyranny
so
long
the
sons
of
men
will
be
cringing
intellectual
cowards
let
us
think
and
let
us
honestly
express
our
thought
do
not
imagine
for
a
moment
that
i
think
people
who
disagree
with
me
are
bad
people
i
admit
and
i
cheerfully
admit
that
a
very
large
proportion
of
mankind
and
a
very
large
majority
a
vast
number
are
reasonably
honest
i
believe
that
most
christians
believe
what
they
teach
that
most
ministers
are
endeavoring
to
make
this
world
better
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
better
than
they
are
it
is
an
intellectual
question
it
is
a
question
first
of
intellectual
liberty
and
after
that
a
question
to
be
settled
at
the
bar
of
human
reason
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
better
than
the
are
probably
i
am
a
good
deal
worse
than
many
of
them
but
that
is
not
the
question
the
question
is
bad
as
i
am
have
i
a
right
to
think
and
i
think
i
have
for
two
reasons
first
i
ca
help
it
and
secondly
i
like
it
the
whole
question
is
right
at
a
point
if
i
have
not
a
right
to
express
my
thoughts
who
has
oh
they
say
we
will
allow
you
we
will
not
burn
you
all
right
why
wo
you
burn
me
because
we
think
a
decent
man
will
allow
others
to
think
and
express
his
thought
then
the
reason
you
do
not
persecute
me
for
my
thought
is
that
you
believe
it
would
be
infamous
in
you
yes
and
yet
you
worship
a
god
who
will
all
you
declare
punish
me
forever
the
next
question
then
is
can
i
commit
a
sin
against
god
by
thinking
if
god
did
not
intend
i
should
think
why
did
he
give
me
a
thinker
now
then
we
have
got
what
they
call
the
christian
system
of
religion
and
thousands
of
people
wonder
how
i
can
be
wicked
enough
to
attack
that
system
there
are
many
good
things
about
it
and
i
shall
never
attack
anything
that
i
believe
to
be
good
i
shall
never
fear
to
attack
anything
i
honestly
believe
to
be
wrong
we
have
i
say
what
they
call
the
christian
religion
and
i
find
just
in
proportion
that
nations
have
been
religious
just
in
the
proportion
they
have
gone
back
to
barbarism
i
find
that
spain
portugal
italy
are
the
three
worst
nations
in
europe
i
find
that
the
nation
nearest
infidel
is
the
most
prosperous
france
and
so
i
say
there
can
be
no
danger
in
the
exercise
of
absolute
intellectual
freedom
i
find
among
ourselves
the
men
who
think
at
least
as
good
as
those
who
do
not
we
have
i
say
a
christian
system
and
that
is
founded
upon
what
they
are
pleased
to
call
system
the
new
testament
who
wrote
the
new
testament
i
do
know
who
does
know
nobody
we
have
found
some
manuscripts
containing
portions
of
the
new
testament
some
of
those
manuscripts
leave
out
five
or
six
books
many
of
them
others
more
others
less
no
two
of
these
manuscripts
agree
nobody
knows
who
wrote
these
manuscripts
they
are
all
written
in
greek
the
disciples
of
christ
knew
only
hebrew
nobody
ever
saw
so
far
as
we
know
one
of
the
original
hebrew
manuscripts
nobody
ever
saw
anybody
who
had
seen
anybody
who
had
heard
of
anybody
that
had
seen
anybody
that
had
ever
seen
one
of
the
original
hebrew
manuscripts
no
doubt
the
clergy
of
your
city
have
told
you
these
facts
thousands
of
times
and
they
will
be
obliged
to
me
for
having
repeated
them
once
more
these
manuscripts
are
written
in
what
are
called
capital
greek
letters
they
are
called
uncial
characters
and
the
new
testament
was
not
divided
into
chapters
and
verses
even
until
the
year
of
grace
recollect
it
in
the
original
the
manuscripts
and
gospels
are
signed
by
nobody
the
epistles
are
addressed
to
nobody
and
they
are
signed
by
the
same
person
all
the
addresses
all
the
pretended
earmarks
showing
to
whom
they
are
written
and
by
whom
they
are
written
are
simply
interpolations
and
everybody
who
has
studied
the
subject
knows
it
it
is
further
admitted
that
even
these
manuscripts
have
not
been
properly
translated
and
they
have
a
syndicate
now
making
a
new
translation
and
i
suppose
that
i
can
not
tell
whether
i
really
believe
the
testament
or
not
until
i
see
that
new
translation
you
must
remember
also
one
other
thing
christ
never
wrote
a
solitary
word
of
the
new
testament
not
one
word
there
is
an
account
that
he
once
stooped
and
wrote
something
in
the
sand
but
that
has
not
been
preserved
he
never
told
anybody
to
write
a
word
he
never
said
matthew
remember
this
mark
do
forget
to
put
that
down
luke
be
sure
that
in
your
gospel
you
have
this
john
do
forget
it
not
one
word
and
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
a
being
coming
from
another
world
with
a
message
of
infinite
importance
to
mankind
should
at
least
have
verified
that
message
by
his
own
signature
why
was
nothing
written
i
will
tell
you
in
my
judgment
they
expected
the
end
of
the
world
in
a
very
few
days
that
generation
was
not
to
pass
away
until
the
heavens
should
be
rolled
up
as
a
scroll
and
until
the
earth
should
melt
with
fervent
heat
that
was
their
belief
they
believed
that
the
world
was
to
be
destroyed
and
that
there
was
to
be
another
coming
and
that
the
saints
were
then
to
govern
the
world
and
they
even
went
so
far
among
the
apostles
as
we
frequently
do
now
before
election
as
to
divide
out
the
offices
in
advance
this
testament
was
not
written
for
hundreds
of
years
after
the
apostles
were
dust
these
facts
lived
in
the
open
mouth
of
credulity
they
were
in
the
wastebaskets
of
forgetfulness
they
depended
upon
the
inaccuracy
of
legend
and
for
centuries
these
doctrines
and
stories
were
blown
about
by
the
inconstant
winds
and
finally
when
reduced
to
writing
some
gentleman
would
write
by
the
side
of
the
passage
his
idea
of
it
and
the
next
copyist
would
put
that
in
as
a
part
of
the
text
and
finally
when
it
was
made
and
the
church
got
in
trouble
and
wanted
a
passage
to
help
it
out
one
was
interpolated
to
order
so
that
now
it
is
among
the
easiest
things
in
the
world
to
pick
out
at
least
one
hundred
interpolations
in
the
testament
and
i
will
pick
some
of
them
out
before
i
get
through
and
let
me
say
here
once
for
all
that
for
the
man
christ
i
have
infinite
respect
let
me
say
once
for
all
that
the
place
where
man
has
died
for
man
is
holy
ground
and
let
me
say
once
for
all
to
that
great
and
serene
man
i
gladly
pay
the
homage
of
my
admiration
and
my
tears
he
was
a
reformer
in
his
day
he
was
an
infidel
in
his
time
he
was
regarded
as
a
blasphemer
and
his
life
was
destroyed
by
hypocrites
who
have
in
all
ages
done
what
they
could
to
trample
freedom
out
of
the
human
mind
had
i
lived
at
that
time
i
would
have
been
his
friend
and
should
he
come
again
he
would
not
find
a
better
friend
than
i
will
be
that
is
for
the
man
for
the
theological
creation
i
have
a
different
feeling
if
he
was
in
fact
god
he
knew
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
death
he
knew
that
what
we
call
death
was
but
the
eternal
opening
of
the
golden
gates
of
everlasting
joy
and
it
took
no
heroism
to
face
a
death
that
was
simply
eternal
life
but
when
a
man
when
a
poor
boy
sixteen
years
of
age
goes
upon
the
field
of
battle
to
keep
his
flag
in
heaven
not
knowing
but
that
death
ends
all
not
knowing
but
that
when
the
shadows
creep
over
him
the
darkness
will
be
eternal
there
is
heroism
and
so
for
the
man
who
in
the
darkness
said
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
for
that
man
i
have
nothing
but
respect
admiration
and
love
a
while
ago
i
made
up
my
mind
to
find
out
what
was
necessary
for
me
to
do
in
order
to
be
saved
if
i
have
got
a
soul
i
want
it
saved
i
do
not
wish
to
lose
anything
that
is
of
value
for
thousands
of
years
the
world
has
been
asking
that
question
what
shall
we
do
to
be
saved
saved
from
poverty
no
saved
from
crime
no
tyranny
no
but
what
shall
we
do
to
be
saved
from
the
eternal
wrath
of
the
god
who
made
us
all
if
god
made
us
he
will
not
destroy
us
infinite
wisdom
never
made
a
poor
investment
and
upon
all
the
works
of
an
infinite
god
a
dividend
must
finally
be
declared
the
pulpit
has
cast
a
shadow
over
even
the
cradle
the
doctrine
of
endless
punishment
has
covered
the
cheeks
of
this
world
with
tears
i
despise
it
and
i
defy
it
i
made
up
my
mind
i
say
to
see
what
i
had
to
do
in
order
to
save
my
soul
according
to
the
testament
and
thereupon
i
read
it
i
read
the
gospel
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
but
i
found
that
the
church
had
been
deceiving
me
i
found
that
the
clergy
did
not
understand
their
own
book
i
found
that
they
had
been
building
upon
passages
that
had
been
interpolated
i
found
that
they
had
been
building
upon
passages
that
were
entirely
untrue
and
i
will
tell
you
why
i
think
so
the
first
of
these
gospels
was
written
by
matthew
according
to
the
claim
of
course
he
never
wrote
a
word
of
it
never
saw
it
never
heard
of
it
but
for
the
purpose
of
this
lecture
i
will
admit
that
he
wrote
it
i
will
admit
that
he
was
with
christ
for
three
years
that
he
heard
much
of
his
conversation
during
that
time
and
that
he
became
impregnated
with
the
doctrines
or
dogmas
and
the
ideas
of
jesus
christ
now
let
us
see
what
matthew
says
we
must
do
in
order
to
be
saved
and
i
take
it
that
if
this
be
true
matthew
is
as
good
an
authority
as
any
minister
in
the
world
the
first
thing
i
find
upon
the
subject
of
salvation
is
in
the
fifth
chapter
of
matthew
and
is
embraced
in
what
is
commonly
known
as
the
sermon
on
the
mount
it
is
as
follows
blessed
are
the
poor
in
spirit
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
good
blessed
are
the
merciful
for
they
shall
obtain
mercy
good
whether
they
belonged
to
any
church
or
not
whether
they
believed
the
bible
or
not
blessed
are
the
merciful
for
they
shall
obtain
mercy
good
blessed
are
the
pure
in
heart
for
they
shall
see
god
blessed
are
the
peacemakers
for
they
shall
be
called
the
children
of
god
blessed
are
they
which
are
persecuted
for
righteousness
sake
that
me
little
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
in
the
same
sermon
he
says
think
not
that
i
am
come
to
destroy
the
law
or
the
prophets
i
am
not
come
to
destroy
but
to
fulfill
and
then
he
makes
use
of
this
remarkable
language
almost
as
applicable
today
as
it
was
then
for
i
say
unto
you
that
except
your
righteousness
shall
exceed
the
righteousness
of
the
scribes
and
pharisees
ye
shall
in
no
wise
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
good
in
the
sixth
chapter
i
find
the
following
and
it
comes
directly
after
the
prayer
known
as
the
lord
prayer
for
if
you
forgive
men
their
trespasses
your
heavenly
father
will
also
forgive
you
but
if
ye
forgive
not
men
their
trespasses
neither
will
your
father
forgive
your
trespasses
i
accept
the
conditions
there
is
an
offer
i
accept
it
if
you
will
forgive
men
that
trespass
against
you
god
will
forgive
your
trespasses
against
him
i
accept
and
i
never
will
ask
any
god
to
treat
me
any
better
than
i
treat
my
fellowmen
there
is
a
square
promise
there
is
a
contract
if
you
will
forgive
others
god
will
forgive
you
and
it
does
not
say
you
must
believe
in
the
old
testament
nor
be
baptized
nor
join
the
church
nor
keep
sunday
it
simply
says
if
you
forgive
others
god
will
forgive
you
and
it
must
be
true
no
god
could
afford
to
damn
a
forgiving
man
a
voice
will
he
forgive
democrats
oh
certainly
let
me
say
right
here
that
i
know
lots
of
democrats
great
broad
clever
men
and
i
love
them
and
the
only
bad
thing
about
them
is
that
they
vote
the
democratic
ticket
and
i
know
lots
of
republicans
so
mean
and
narrow
that
the
only
decent
thing
about
them
is
that
they
vote
the
republican
ticket
now
let
me
make
myself
plain
upon
that
subject
perfectly
plain
for
instance
i
hate
presbyterianism
but
i
know
hundreds
of
splendid
presbyterians
understand
me
i
hate
methodism
and
yet
i
know
hundreds
of
splendid
methodists
i
dislike
a
certain
set
of
principles
called
democracy
and
yet
i
know
thousands
of
democrats
that
i
respect
and
like
i
like
a
certain
set
of
principles
that
is
most
of
them
called
republicanism
and
yet
i
know
lots
of
republicans
that
are
a
disgrace
to
those
principles
i
do
not
war
against
men
i
do
not
war
against
persons
i
war
against
certain
doctrines
that
i
believe
to
be
wrong
and
i
give
to
every
other
human
being
every
right
that
i
claim
for
myself
of
course
i
did
not
intend
today
to
tell
what
we
must
do
in
the
election
for
the
purpose
of
being
saved
the
next
thing
that
i
find
is
in
the
seventh
chapter
and
the
second
verse
for
with
what
judgment
ye
judge
ye
shall
be
judged
and
with
what
measure
ye
mete
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
again
good
that
suits
me
and
in
the
twelfth
chapter
of
matthew
for
whosoever
shall
do
the
will
of
my
father
that
is
in
heaven
the
same
is
my
brother
and
sister
and
mother
for
the
son
of
man
shall
come
in
the
glory
of
his
father
with
his
angels
and
then
he
shall
reward
every
man
according
to
the
church
he
belongs
to
no
to
the
manner
in
which
he
was
baptized
no
according
to
his
creed
no
then
he
shall
reward
every
man
according
to
his
works
good
i
subscribe
to
that
doctrine
and
in
the
sixteenth
chapter
and
jesus
called
a
little
child
to
him
and
stood
him
in
the
midst
and
said
i
say
unto
you
except
ye
become
converted
and
become
as
little
children
ye
shall
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
i
do
not
wonder
that
a
reformer
in
his
day
that
met
the
scribes
and
pharisees
and
hypocrites
i
do
not
wonder
that
at
last
he
turned
to
children
and
said
except
ye
become
as
little
children
i
do
not
wonder
and
yet
see
what
children
the
children
of
god
have
been
what
an
interesting
dimpled
darling
john
calvin
was
think
of
that
prattling
babe
known
as
jonathan
edwards
think
of
the
infants
that
founded
the
inquisition
that
invented
instruments
of
torture
to
tear
human
flesh
they
were
the
ones
who
had
become
as
little
children
so
i
find
in
the
nineteenth
chapter
and
behold
one
came
and
said
unto
him
master
what
good
thing
shall
i
do
in
order
to
inherit
eternal
life
and
he
said
unto
him
callest
thou
me
good
there
is
none
good
but
one
and
that
is
god
but
if
thou
will
enter
into
eternal
life
keep
the
commandments
and
he
said
unto
him
now
there
is
a
pretty
fair
issue
here
is
a
child
of
god
asking
god
what
is
necessary
for
him
to
do
in
order
to
inherit
eternal
life
and
god
says
to
him
keep
the
commandments
and
the
child
said
to
the
almighty
which
now
if
there
ever
had
been
an
opportunity
given
to
the
almighty
to
furnish
a
gentleman
with
an
inquiring
mind
with
the
necessary
information
upon
that
subject
here
was
the
opportunity
he
said
unto
him
and
jesus
said
thou
shalt
do
no
murder
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
thou
shalt
not
steal
thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
honor
thy
father
and
mother
and
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
he
did
not
say
to
him
you
must
believe
in
me
that
i
am
the
only
begotten
son
of
the
living
god
he
did
not
say
you
must
be
born
again
he
did
not
say
you
must
believe
the
bible
he
did
not
say
you
must
remember
the
sabbath
day
to
keep
it
holy
he
simply
said
thou
shalt
do
no
murder
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
thou
shalt
not
steal
thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother
and
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
and
thereupon
the
young
man
who
i
think
was
a
little
fresh
and
probably
mistaken
said
unto
him
all
these
things
have
i
kept
from
my
youth
up
i
do
believe
that
now
comes
in
an
interpolation
in
the
old
times
when
the
church
got
a
little
scarce
for
money
they
always
put
in
a
passage
praising
poverty
so
they
had
this
young
man
ask
what
lack
i
yet
and
jesus
said
unto
him
if
thou
wilt
be
perfect
go
and
sell
that
thou
hast
and
give
it
to
the
poor
and
thou
shalt
have
treasures
in
heaven
the
church
has
always
been
willing
to
swap
off
treasures
in
heaven
for
cash
down
and
when
the
next
verse
was
written
the
church
must
have
been
nearly
and
again
i
say
unto
you
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
did
you
ever
know
a
wealthy
disciple
to
unload
on
account
of
that
verse
and
then
comes
another
verse
which
i
believe
is
an
interpolation
and
every
one
that
has
forsaken
houses
or
brethren
or
sisters
or
father
or
mother
or
wife
or
children
or
lands
for
my
name
sake
shall
receive
an
hundredfold
and
shall
inherit
everlasting
life
christ
never
said
it
never
whosoever
shall
forsake
father
and
mother
why
he
said
to
this
man
who
asked
him
what
shall
i
do
to
inherit
eternal
life
among
other
things
he
said
honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother
and
we
turn
over
the
page
and
he
says
if
you
will
desert
your
father
and
your
mother
you
shall
have
everlasting
life
it
do
if
you
desert
your
wife
and
your
little
children
or
your
lands
the
idea
of
putting
a
house
and
lot
on
equality
with
wife
and
children
think
of
that
i
do
not
accept
the
terms
i
will
never
desert
the
one
i
love
for
the
promise
of
any
god
it
is
far
more
important
that
we
shall
love
our
wives
than
that
we
shall
love
god
and
i
will
tell
you
why
you
can
not
help
him
you
can
help
her
you
can
fill
her
life
with
the
perfume
of
perpetual
joy
it
is
far
more
important
that
you
love
your
children
than
that
you
love
jesus
and
why
if
he
is
god
you
can
not
help
him
but
you
can
plant
a
little
flower
of
happiness
in
every
footstep
of
the
child
from
the
cradle
until
you
die
in
that
child
arms
let
me
tell
you
it
is
far
more
important
to
build
a
home
than
to
erect
a
church
the
holiest
temple
beneath
the
stars
is
a
home
that
love
has
built
and
the
holiest
altar
in
all
the
wide
world
is
the
fireside
around
which
gather
father
and
mother
and
children
there
was
a
time
when
people
believed
that
infamy
there
was
a
time
when
they
did
desert
fathers
and
mothers
and
wives
and
children
augustine
says
to
the
devotee
fly
to
the
desert
and
though
your
wife
put
her
arms
around
your
neck
tear
her
hands
away
she
is
a
temptation
of
the
devil
though
your
father
and
mother
throw
their
bodies
athwart
your
threshold
step
over
them
and
though
your
children
pursue
and
with
weeping
eyes
beseech
you
to
return
listen
not
it
is
the
temptation
of
the
evil
one
fly
to
the
desert
and
save
your
soul
think
of
such
a
soul
being
worth
saving
while
i
live
i
propose
to
stand
by
the
folks
here
there
is
another
condition
of
salvation
i
find
it
in
the
chapter
then
shall
the
king
say
unto
them
on
his
right
hand
ye
blessed
of
my
father
inherit
the
kingdom
prepared
for
you
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
for
i
was
a
hungered
and
ye
gave
me
meat
i
was
thirsty
and
ye
gave
me
drink
i
was
a
stranger
and
ye
took
me
in
naked
and
ye
clothed
me
and
i
was
sick
and
ye
visited
me
and
i
was
in
prison
and
ye
came
unto
me
good
and
i
tell
you
tonight
that
god
will
not
punish
with
eternal
thirst
the
man
who
has
put
the
cup
of
cold
water
to
the
lips
of
his
neighbor
god
will
not
allow
to
live
in
eternal
nakedness
of
pain
the
man
who
has
clothed
others
for
instance
here
is
a
shipwreck
and
here
is
some
brave
sailor
stands
aside
and
allows
a
woman
whom
he
never
saw
before
to
take
his
place
in
the
boat
and
he
stands
there
grand
and
serene
as
the
wide
sea
and
he
goes
down
do
you
tell
me
there
is
any
god
who
will
push
the
from
the
shore
of
eternal
life
when
that
man
wishes
to
step
in
do
you
tell
me
that
god
can
be
unpitying
to
the
pitiful
that
he
can
be
unforgiving
to
the
forgiving
i
deny
it
and
from
the
aspersions
of
the
pulpit
i
seek
to
rescue
the
reputation
of
the
deity
now
i
have
read
you
everything
in
matthew
on
the
subject
of
salvation
that
is
all
there
is
not
one
word
about
believing
anything
it
is
the
gospel
of
deed
the
gospel
of
charity
the
gospel
of
and
if
only
that
gospel
had
been
preached
persecution
never
would
have
shed
one
drop
of
blood
not
one
now
according
to
the
testimony
matthew
was
well
acquainted
with
christ
according
to
the
testimony
he
had
been
with
him
and
his
companion
for
years
and
if
it
was
necessary
to
believe
anything
in
order
to
get
to
heaven
matthew
should
have
told
us
but
he
forgot
it
or
he
did
believe
it
or
he
never
heard
of
it
you
can
take
your
choice
the
next
is
mark
now
let
us
see
what
he
says
and
for
the
purpose
of
this
lecture
it
is
sufficient
for
me
to
say
that
mark
agrees
substantially
with
matthew
that
god
will
be
merciful
to
the
merciful
that
he
will
be
kind
to
the
kind
that
he
will
pity
the
pitying
and
it
is
precisely
or
substantially
the
same
as
matthew
until
i
come
to
the
verse
of
the
chapter
and
then
i
strike
an
interpolation
put
in
by
hypocrisy
put
in
by
priests
who
longed
to
grasp
with
bloody
hands
the
sceptre
of
universal
authority
let
me
read
it
to
you
and
it
is
the
most
infamous
passage
in
the
bible
christ
never
said
it
no
sensible
man
ever
said
it
and
he
said
unto
them
that
is
unto
his
disciples
go
ye
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
he
that
believeth
and
is
baptized
shall
be
saved
and
he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
damned
now
i
propose
to
prove
to
you
that
that
is
an
interpolation
now
how
will
i
do
it
in
the
first
place
not
one
word
is
said
about
belief
in
matthew
in
the
next
place
not
one
word
is
said
about
belief
in
mark
until
i
come
to
that
verse
and
when
is
that
said
to
have
been
spoken
according
to
mark
it
is
a
part
of
the
last
conversation
of
jesus
christ
just
before
according
to
the
account
he
ascended
bodily
before
their
eyes
if
there
ever
was
any
important
thing
happened
in
this
world
that
is
one
of
them
if
there
was
any
conversation
that
people
would
be
apt
to
recollect
it
would
be
the
last
conversation
with
god
before
he
rose
through
the
air
and
seated
himself
upon
the
throne
of
the
infinite
we
have
in
this
testament
five
accounts
of
the
last
conversation
happening
between
jesus
christ
and
his
apostles
matthew
gives
it
and
yet
matthew
does
not
state
that
in
that
conversation
he
said
whoso
believeth
and
is
baptized
shall
be
saved
and
whoso
believeth
not
shall
be
damned
and
if
he
did
say
those
words
they
were
the
most
important
that
ever
fell
from
his
lips
matthew
did
not
hear
it
or
did
not
believe
it
or
forgot
it
then
i
turn
to
luke
and
he
gives
an
account
of
this
same
last
conversation
and
not
one
word
does
he
say
upon
that
subject
now
it
is
the
most
important
thing
if
christ
said
it
that
he
ever
said
then
i
turn
to
john
and
he
gives
an
account
of
the
last
conversation
but
not
one
solitary
word
on
the
subject
of
belief
or
unbelief
not
one
solitary
word
on
the
subject
of
damnation
not
one
then
i
turn
to
the
first
chapter
of
the
acts
and
there
i
find
an
account
of
the
last
conversation
and
in
that
conversation
there
is
not
one
word
upon
this
subject
now
i
say
that
demonstrates
that
the
passage
in
mark
is
an
interpolation
what
other
reason
have
i
got
that
there
is
not
one
particle
of
sense
in
it
why
no
man
can
control
his
belief
you
hear
evidence
for
and
against
and
the
integrity
of
the
soul
stands
at
the
scales
and
tells
which
side
rises
and
which
side
falls
you
can
not
believe
as
you
wish
you
must
believe
as
you
must
and
he
might
as
well
have
said
go
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
and
whosoever
has
red
hair
shall
be
saved
and
whosoever
hath
not
shall
be
damned
i
have
another
reason
i
am
much
obliged
to
the
gentleman
who
interpolated
these
passages
i
am
much
obliged
to
him
that
he
put
in
some
more
two
more
now
hear
and
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that
believe
good
in
my
name
shall
they
cast
out
devils
they
shall
speak
with
new
tongues
and
they
shall
take
up
serpents
and
if
they
drink
any
deadly
thing
it
shall
not
hurt
them
they
shall
lay
hands
on
the
sick
and
they
shall
recover
bring
on
your
believer
let
him
cast
out
a
devil
i
do
not
claim
a
large
one
just
a
little
one
for
a
cent
let
him
take
up
serpents
and
if
he
drink
any
deadly
thing
it
shall
not
hurt
him
let
me
mix
up
a
dose
for
the
theological
believer
and
if
it
does
not
hurt
him
i
join
a
church
o
but
they
say
those
things
only
lasted
through
that
apostolic
age
let
us
see
go
ye
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
he
that
believeth
and
is
baptized
shall
be
saved
but
he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
damned
and
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that
believe
how
long
i
think
at
least
until
they
had
gone
into
all
the
world
certainly
these
signs
should
follow
until
all
the
world
had
been
visited
and
yet
if
that
declaration
was
in
the
mouth
of
christ
he
then
knew
that
of
the
world
was
unknown
and
that
he
would
be
dead
years
before
his
disciples
would
know
that
there
was
another
world
and
yet
he
said
go
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
and
he
knew
then
that
it
would
be
years
before
anybody
went
well
if
it
was
worth
while
to
have
signs
follow
believers
in
the
old
world
surely
it
was
worth
while
to
have
signs
follow
believers
in
the
new
world
and
the
very
reason
that
signs
should
follow
would
be
to
convince
the
unbeliever
and
there
are
as
many
unbelievers
now
as
ever
and
the
signs
are
as
necessary
today
as
they
ever
were
i
would
like
a
few
myself
this
frightful
declaration
he
that
believeth
and
is
baptized
shall
be
saved
but
he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
damned
has
filled
the
world
with
agony
and
crime
every
letter
of
this
passage
has
been
sword
and
fagot
every
word
has
been
dungeon
and
chain
that
passage
made
the
sword
of
persecution
drip
with
innocent
blood
for
ten
centuries
that
passage
made
the
horizon
of
a
thousand
years
lurid
with
the
flames
of
fagots
that
passage
contradicts
the
sermon
on
the
mount
that
passage
travesties
the
lord
prayer
that
passage
turns
the
splendid
religion
of
deed
and
duty
into
the
superstition
of
creed
and
cruelty
i
deny
it
it
is
infamous
christ
never
said
it
now
i
come
to
luke
and
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
luke
substantially
agrees
with
matthew
and
with
mark
substantially
agrees
as
the
evidence
is
read
i
like
it
be
ye
therefore
merciful
as
your
father
also
is
merciful
good
judge
not
and
ye
shall
not
be
judged
condemn
not
and
ye
shall
not
be
condemned
forgive
and
ye
shall
be
forgiven
good
give
and
it
shall
be
given
unto
you
good
measure
pressed
down
and
shaken
together
and
running
over
good
i
like
it
for
with
the
same
measure
that
ye
mete
withal
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
again
he
agrees
substantially
with
mark
he
agrees
substantially
with
matthew
and
i
come
at
last
to
the
nineteenth
chapter
and
zaccheus
stood
and
said
unto
the
lord
lord
the
half
of
my
goods
i
give
to
the
poor
and
if
i
have
taken
anything
from
any
man
by
false
accusation
i
restore
him
and
jesus
said
unto
him
day
is
salvation
come
to
this
house
that
is
good
doctrine
he
did
ask
zaccheus
what
he
believed
he
did
ask
him
do
you
believe
in
the
bible
do
you
believe
in
the
five
points
have
you
ever
been
oh
immersed
half
of
my
goods
i
give
to
the
poor
and
if
i
have
taken
anything
from
any
man
by
false
accusation
i
restore
him
and
christ
said
day
is
salvation
come
to
this
house
good
i
read
also
in
luke
that
christ
when
upon
the
cross
forgave
his
murderers
and
that
is
considered
the
shining
gem
in
the
crown
of
his
mercy
that
he
forgave
his
murderers
that
he
forgave
the
men
who
drove
the
nails
in
his
hands
in
his
feet
that
plunged
a
spear
in
his
side
the
soldier
that
in
the
hour
of
death
offered
him
in
mockery
the
bitterness
to
drink
that
he
forgave
them
all
freely
and
that
yet
although
he
would
forgive
them
he
will
in
the
nineteenth
century
damn
to
eternal
fire
an
honest
man
for
the
expression
of
his
honest
thoughts
that
wo
do
i
find
too
in
luke
an
account
of
two
thieves
that
were
crucified
at
the
same
time
the
other
gospels
speak
of
them
one
says
they
both
railed
upon
him
another
says
nothing
about
it
in
luke
we
are
told
that
one
did
but
one
of
the
thieves
looked
and
pitied
christ
and
christ
said
to
that
thief
this
day
shalt
thou
meet
me
in
paradise
why
did
he
say
that
because
the
thief
pitied
him
and
god
can
not
afford
to
trample
beneath
the
feet
of
his
infinite
wrath
the
smallest
blossom
of
pity
that
ever
shed
its
perfume
in
the
human
heart
who
was
this
thief
to
what
church
did
he
belong
i
do
know
the
fact
that
he
was
a
thief
throws
no
light
on
that
question
who
was
he
what
did
he
believe
i
do
know
did
he
believe
in
the
old
testament
in
the
miracles
i
do
know
did
he
believe
that
christ
was
god
i
do
know
why
then
was
the
promise
made
to
him
that
he
should
meet
christ
in
paradise
simply
because
he
pitied
innocence
suffering
on
the
cross
god
can
not
afford
to
damn
any
man
that
is
capable
of
pitying
anybody
and
now
we
come
to
john
and
that
is
where
the
trouble
commences
the
other
gospels
teach
that
god
will
be
merciful
to
the
merciful
forgiving
to
the
forgiving
kind
to
the
kind
loving
to
the
loving
just
to
the
just
merciful
to
the
good
now
we
come
to
john
and
here
is
another
doctrine
and
allow
me
to
say
that
john
was
not
written
until
centuries
after
the
others
this
the
church
got
up
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
i
say
unto
thee
that
except
a
man
be
born
again
he
can
not
see
the
kingdom
of
god
why
did
he
tell
matthew
that
why
did
he
tell
luke
that
why
did
he
tell
mark
that
they
never
heard
of
it
or
forgot
it
or
they
did
believe
it
except
a
man
be
born
of
water
and
of
the
spirit
he
can
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
why
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
and
that
which
is
born
of
the
spirit
is
spirit
marvel
not
that
i
said
unto
thee
must
be
born
again
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
and
that
which
is
born
of
the
spirit
is
spirit
and
he
might
have
added
that
which
is
born
of
water
is
water
marvel
not
that
i
say
unto
thee
must
be
born
again
and
then
the
reason
is
given
and
i
admit
i
did
not
understand
it
myself
until
i
read
the
reason
and
will
understand
it
as
well
as
i
do
and
here
it
is
the
wind
bloweth
where
it
listeth
and
thou
hearest
the
sound
thereof
and
canst
not
tell
whence
it
cometh
and
whither
it
goeth
so
i
find
in
the
book
of
john
the
idea
of
the
real
presence
so
i
find
in
the
book
of
john
that
in
order
to
be
saved
we
must
eat
of
the
flesh
and
we
must
drink
of
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
and
if
that
gospel
is
true
the
catholic
church
is
right
but
it
is
not
true
i
can
not
believe
it
and
yet
for
all
that
it
may
be
true
but
i
believe
it
neither
do
i
believe
there
is
any
god
in
the
universe
who
will
damn
a
man
simply
for
expressing
his
belief
why
they
say
to
me
suppose
all
this
should
turn
out
to
be
true
and
you
should
come
to
the
day
of
judgment
and
find
all
these
things
to
be
true
what
would
you
do
then
i
would
walk
up
like
a
man
and
say
i
was
mistaken
and
suppose
god
was
about
to
pass
judgment
on
you
what
would
you
say
i
would
say
to
him
do
unto
others
as
you
would
that
others
should
do
unto
you
why
not
i
am
told
that
i
must
render
good
for
evil
i
am
told
that
if
smitten
on
one
cheek
i
must
turn
the
other
i
am
told
that
i
must
overcome
evil
with
good
i
am
told
that
i
must
love
my
enemies
and
will
it
do
for
this
god
who
tells
me
love
my
enemies
to
say
i
will
damn
mine
no
it
will
not
do
it
will
not
do
in
the
book
of
john
all
this
doctrine
of
regeneration
all
this
doctrine
that
it
is
necessary
to
believe
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
all
the
doctrine
that
salvation
depends
upon
belief
in
this
book
of
john
all
these
doctrines
find
their
warrant
nowhere
else
read
these
three
gospels
and
then
read
john
and
you
will
agree
with
me
that
the
gospels
that
teach
we
must
be
kind
we
must
be
merciful
we
must
be
forgiving
and
thereupon
that
god
will
forgive
us
is
true
and
then
say
whether
or
no
that
doctrine
is
not
better
than
the
doctrine
that
somebody
else
can
be
good
for
you
that
somebody
else
can
be
bad
for
you
and
that
the
only
way
to
get
to
heaven
is
to
believe
something
that
you
do
not
understand
now
upon
these
gospels
that
i
have
read
the
churches
rest
and
out
of
those
things
that
i
have
read
they
have
made
their
creeds
and
the
first
church
to
make
a
creed
so
far
as
i
know
was
the
catholic
i
take
it
that
is
the
first
church
that
had
any
power
that
is
the
church
that
has
preserved
all
these
miracles
for
us
that
is
the
church
that
preserved
the
manuscripts
for
us
that
is
the
church
whose
word
we
have
to
take
that
church
is
the
first
witness
that
protestantism
brought
to
the
bar
of
history
to
prove
miracles
that
took
place
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
and
while
the
witness
is
there
protestantism
takes
pains
to
say
you
ca
believe
one
word
that
witness
says
now
that
church
is
the
only
one
that
keeps
up
a
constant
communication
with
heaven
through
the
instrumentality
of
a
large
number
of
decayed
saints
that
church
is
an
agent
of
god
on
earth
that
church
has
a
person
who
stands
in
the
place
of
deity
and
that
church
according
to
their
doctrine
is
infallible
that
church
has
persecuted
to
the
exact
extent
of
her
power
and
always
will
in
spain
that
church
stands
erect
and
that
church
is
arrogant
in
the
united
states
that
church
crawls
but
the
object
in
both
countries
is
the
same
and
that
is
the
destruction
of
intellectual
liberty
that
church
teaches
us
that
we
can
make
god
happy
by
being
miserable
ourselves
that
church
teaches
you
that
a
nun
is
holier
in
the
sight
of
god
than
a
loving
mother
with
a
child
in
her
thrilled
and
thrilling
arms
that
church
teaches
you
that
a
priest
is
better
than
a
father
that
church
teaches
you
that
celibacy
is
better
than
that
passion
of
love
that
has
made
everything
of
beauty
in
this
world
that
church
tells
the
girl
of
or
years
of
age
with
eyes
like
dew
and
light
that
girl
with
the
red
of
health
in
the
white
of
her
beautiful
checks
tells
that
girl
put
on
the
veil
woven
of
death
and
night
kneel
upon
stones
and
you
will
please
god
i
tell
you
that
by
law
no
girl
should
be
allowed
to
take
the
veil
and
renounce
the
beauties
of
the
world
until
she
was
at
least
years
of
age
wait
until
she
knows
what
she
wants
i
am
opposed
to
allowing
these
priests
weaving
webs
to
catch
the
flies
of
youth
and
there
ought
to
be
a
law
appointing
commissioners
to
visit
such
places
twice
a
year
and
release
every
person
who
expresses
a
desire
to
be
released
i
do
believe
in
keeping
penitentiaries
for
god
no
doubt
they
are
honest
about
it
that
is
not
the
question
now
this
church
after
a
few
centuries
of
thought
made
a
creed
and
that
creed
is
the
foundation
of
orthodox
religion
let
me
read
it
to
you
whosoever
will
be
saved
before
all
things
it
is
necessary
that
he
hold
the
catholic
faith
which
faith
except
every
one
do
keep
entire
and
inviolate
without
doubt
he
shall
everlastingly
perish
now
the
faith
is
this
that
we
worship
one
god
in
trinity
and
trinity
in
unity
of
course
you
understand
how
that
done
and
there
no
need
of
my
explaining
it
neither
confounding
the
persons
nor
dividing
the
substance
you
see
what
a
predicament
that
would
leave
the
deity
in
if
you
divided
the
substance
for
one
is
the
person
of
the
father
another
of
the
son
and
another
of
the
holy
ghost
but
the
godhead
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
is
all
one
you
know
what
i
mean
by
godhead
in
glory
equal
and
in
majesty
such
as
the
father
is
such
is
the
son
such
is
the
holy
ghost
the
father
is
uncreated
the
son
uncreated
the
holy
ghost
uncreated
the
father
incomprehensible
the
son
incomprehensible
the
holy
ghost
incomprehensible
and
that
is
the
reason
we
know
so
much
about
the
thing
the
father
is
eternal
the
son
eternal
the
holy
ghost
eternal
and
yet
there
are
not
three
eternals
only
one
eternal
as
also
there
are
not
three
uncreated
nor
three
incomprehensibles
only
one
uncreated
one
incomprehensible
in
like
manner
the
father
is
almighty
the
son
almighty
the
holy
ghost
almighty
yet
there
are
not
three
almighties
only
one
almighty
so
the
father
is
god
the
son
god
the
holy
ghost
god
and
yet
not
three
gods
and
so
likewise
the
father
is
lord
the
son
is
lord
the
holy
ghost
is
lord
yet
there
are
not
three
lords
for
as
we
are
compelled
by
the
christian
truth
to
acknowledge
every
person
by
himself
to
be
god
and
lord
so
we
are
all
forbidden
by
the
catholic
religion
to
say
there
are
three
gods
or
three
lords
the
father
is
made
of
no
one
not
created
or
begotten
the
son
is
from
the
father
alone
not
made
nor
created
or
begotten
the
holy
ghost
is
from
the
father
and
the
son
not
made
nor
begotten
but
proceeded
you
know
what
proceeding
is
so
there
is
one
father
not
three
fathers
why
should
there
be
three
fathers
and
only
one
son
one
son
and
not
three
sons
one
holy
ghost
not
three
holy
ghosts
and
in
this
trinity
there
is
nothing
before
or
afterward
nothing
greater
or
less
but
the
whole
three
persons
are
coeternal
with
one
another
and
coequal
so
that
in
all
things
the
unity
is
to
be
worshiped
in
trinity
and
the
trinity
is
to
be
worshiped
in
unity
and
therefore
we
will
believe
those
who
will
be
saved
must
thus
think
of
the
trinity
furthermore
it
is
necessary
to
everlasting
salvation
that
he
also
believe
rightly
the
incarnation
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
now
the
right
of
this
thing
is
this
that
we
believe
and
confess
that
our
lord
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
is
both
god
and
man
he
is
god
of
the
substance
of
his
father
begotten
before
the
world
was
that
was
a
good
while
before
his
mother
lived
and
he
is
man
of
the
substance
of
his
mother
born
in
this
world
perfect
god
and
perfect
man
and
the
rational
soul
in
human
flesh
subsisting
equal
to
the
father
according
to
his
godhead
but
less
than
the
father
according
to
his
manhood
who
being
both
god
and
man
is
not
two
but
one
one
not
by
conversion
of
god
into
flesh
but
by
the
taking
of
the
manhood
into
god
you
see
that
it
is
a
great
deal
easier
than
the
other
one
altogether
not
by
a
confusion
of
substance
but
by
unity
of
person
for
as
the
rational
soul
and
flesh
is
one
man
so
god
the
man
is
one
christ
who
suffered
for
our
salvation
descended
into
hell
rose
again
the
third
day
from
the
dead
ascended
into
heaven
and
he
sitteth
at
the
right
hand
of
god
the
father
almighty
and
he
shall
come
to
judge
the
living
and
the
dead
in
order
to
be
saved
it
is
necessary
to
believe
this
what
a
blessing
that
we
do
not
have
to
understand
it
and
in
order
to
compel
the
human
intellect
to
get
upon
its
knees
before
that
infinite
absurdity
thousands
and
millions
have
suffered
agonies
thousands
and
millions
have
perished
in
dungeons
and
in
fire
and
if
all
the
bones
of
all
the
victims
of
the
catholic
church
could
be
gathered
together
a
monument
higher
than
all
the
pyramids
would
rise
in
our
presence
and
the
eyes
even
of
priests
would
be
suffused
with
tears
that
church
covered
europe
with
cathedrals
and
dungeons
that
church
robbed
men
of
the
jewel
of
the
soul
that
church
had
ignorance
upon
its
knees
that
church
went
into
partnership
with
the
tyrants
of
the
throne
and
between
these
two
vultures
the
altar
and
the
throne
the
heart
of
man
was
devoured
of
course
i
have
met
and
cheerfully
admit
that
there
is
thousands
of
good
catholics
but
catholicism
is
contrary
to
human
liberty
catholicism
bases
salvation
upon
belief
catholicism
teaches
man
to
trample
his
reason
under
foot
and
for
that
reason
it
is
wrong
now
the
next
church
that
comes
along
in
the
way
that
i
wish
to
speak
of
is
the
episcopalian
that
was
founded
by
henry
now
in
heaven
he
cast
off
queen
catherine
and
catholicism
together
and
he
accepted
episcopalianism
and
annie
boleyn
at
the
same
time
that
church
if
it
had
a
few
more
ceremonies
would
be
catholic
if
it
had
a
few
less
nothing
we
have
an
episcopalian
church
in
this
country
and
it
has
all
the
imperfection
of
a
poor
relation
it
is
always
boasting
of
a
rich
relative
in
england
the
creed
is
made
by
law
the
same
as
we
pass
statutes
here
and
when
a
gentleman
dies
in
england
in
order
to
determine
whether
he
shall
be
saved
or
not
it
is
necessary
for
the
power
of
heaven
to
read
the
acts
of
parliament
it
becomes
a
question
of
law
and
sometimes
a
man
is
damned
on
a
very
nice
point
lost
on
demurrer
a
few
years
ago
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
seabury
samuel
seabury
was
sent
over
to
england
to
get
some
apostolic
succession
we
had
a
drop
in
the
house
it
was
necessary
for
the
bishops
of
the
english
church
to
put
their
hands
upon
his
head
they
refused
there
was
no
act
of
parliament
justifying
it
he
had
then
to
go
to
the
scotch
bishops
and
had
the
scotch
bishops
refused
we
never
would
have
had
any
apostolic
succession
in
the
new
world
and
god
would
have
been
driven
out
of
half
the
world
and
the
true
church
never
could
have
been
founded
but
the
scotch
bishops
put
their
hands
on
his
head
and
now
we
have
an
unbroken
succession
of
heads
and
hands
from
paul
to
the
last
bishop
in
this
country
the
episcopal
church
has
done
some
good
and
i
want
to
thank
that
church
having
on
an
average
less
religion
than
the
others
on
an
average
you
have
done
more
good
to
mankind
you
preserved
some
of
the
humanities
you
did
not
hate
music
you
did
not
absolutely
despise
painting
and
you
did
not
altogether
abhor
architecture
and
you
finally
admitted
that
it
was
no
worse
to
keep
time
with
your
feet
than
with
your
hands
and
some
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
people
could
play
cards
and
god
would
overlook
it
or
would
look
the
other
way
for
all
these
things
accept
my
thanks
when
i
was
a
boy
the
other
churches
looked
upon
dancing
as
probably
the
mysterious
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
and
they
used
to
teach
that
when
four
boys
got
in
a
playing
that
the
eternal
god
stood
whetting
the
sword
of
his
eternal
wrath
waiting
to
strike
them
down
to
the
lowest
hell
and
so
that
church
has
done
some
good
after
a
while
in
england
a
couple
of
gentlemen
or
a
couple
of
men
by
the
name
of
wesley
and
whitfield
said
if
everybody
is
going
to
hell
nearly
somebody
ought
to
mention
it
the
episcopal
clergy
said
keep
still
do
tear
your
gown
wesley
and
whitfield
said
this
frightful
truth
ought
to
be
proclaimed
from
the
housetops
at
every
opportunity
from
the
highway
of
every
occasion
they
were
good
honest
men
they
believed
their
doctrine
and
they
said
if
there
is
a
hell
and
a
niagara
of
souls
pouring
over
an
eternal
precipice
of
ignorance
somebody
ought
to
say
something
they
were
right
somebody
ought
if
such
thing
was
true
wesley
was
a
believer
in
the
bible
he
believed
in
the
actual
presence
of
the
almighty
god
used
to
do
miracles
for
him
used
to
put
off
a
rain
several
days
to
give
his
meeting
a
chance
used
to
cure
his
horse
of
lameness
used
to
cure
wesley
headaches
and
wesley
also
believed
in
the
actual
existence
of
the
devil
he
believed
that
devils
had
possession
of
people
he
talked
to
the
devil
when
he
was
in
folks
and
the
devil
told
him
that
he
was
going
to
leave
and
that
he
was
going
into
another
person
that
he
would
be
there
at
a
certain
time
and
wesley
went
to
that
other
person
and
there
the
devil
was
prompt
to
the
minute
he
regarded
every
conversion
as
an
absolute
warfare
between
god
and
this
devil
for
the
possession
of
that
human
soul
honest
no
doubt
wesley
did
not
believe
in
human
liberty
honest
no
doubt
was
opposed
to
the
liberty
of
the
colonies
honestly
so
wesley
preached
a
sermon
entitled
the
cause
and
cure
of
earthquakes
in
which
he
took
the
ground
that
earthquakes
were
caused
by
sin
and
the
only
way
to
stop
them
was
to
believe
in
the
lord
jesus
christ
no
doubt
an
honest
man
wesley
and
whitfield
fell
out
on
the
question
of
predestination
wesley
insisted
that
god
invited
everybody
to
the
feast
whitfield
said
he
did
not
invite
those
he
knew
would
not
come
wesley
said
he
did
whitfield
said
well
he
did
put
plates
for
them
anyway
wesley
said
he
did
so
that
when
they
were
in
hell
he
could
show
them
that
there
was
a
seat
left
for
them
and
that
church
that
they
founded
is
still
active
and
probably
no
church
in
the
world
has
done
so
much
preaching
for
as
little
money
as
the
methodists
whitfield
believed
in
slavery
and
advocated
the
slave
trade
and
it
was
of
whitfield
that
whittier
made
the
two
lines
he
bade
the
slave
ships
speed
from
coast
to
coast
fanned
by
the
wings
of
the
holy
ghost
we
have
lately
had
a
meeting
of
the
methodists
and
i
find
by
their
statistics
that
they
believe
they
have
converted
folks
in
a
year
that
in
order
to
do
this
they
have
preachers
scholars
and
about
invested
in
church
property
i
find
in
looking
over
the
history
of
the
world
that
there
are
or
of
people
born
a
year
and
if
they
are
saved
at
the
rate
of
a
year
about
how
long
will
it
take
that
doctrine
to
save
this
world
good
honest
people
they
are
mistaken
in
old
times
they
were
very
simple
churches
used
to
be
like
barns
they
used
to
have
them
divided
men
on
that
side
and
women
on
this
a
little
barbarous
we
have
advanced
since
then
and
we
now
find
as
a
fact
demonstrated
by
experience
that
a
man
sitting
by
the
woman
he
loves
can
thank
god
as
heartily
as
though
sitting
between
two
men
that
he
has
never
been
introduced
to
there
is
another
thing
these
methodists
should
remember
and
that
is
that
the
episcopalians
were
the
greatest
enemies
they
ever
had
and
they
should
remember
that
the
have
always
treated
them
kindly
and
well
there
is
one
thing
about
the
methodist
church
in
the
north
that
i
like
but
i
find
that
it
is
not
methodism
that
does
that
i
find
that
the
methodist
church
in
the
south
is
as
much
opposed
to
liberty
as
the
methodist
church
north
is
in
favor
of
liberty
so
it
is
not
methodism
that
is
in
favor
of
liberty
or
slavery
they
differ
a
little
in
their
creed
from
the
rest
they
do
not
believe
that
god
does
everything
they
believe
that
he
does
his
part
and
that
you
must
do
the
rest
and
that
getting
to
heaven
is
a
partnership
business
the
next
church
is
the
presbyterians
in
my
judgment
the
worst
of
all
as
far
as
creed
is
concerned
this
church
was
founded
by
john
calvin
a
murderer
john
calvin
having
power
in
geneva
inaugurated
human
torture
voltaire
abolished
torture
in
france
the
man
who
abolished
torture
if
the
christian
religion
be
true
god
is
now
torturing
in
hell
and
the
man
who
inaugurated
torture
is
now
a
glorified
angel
in
heaven
it
wo
do
john
knox
started
this
doctrine
in
scotland
and
there
is
this
peculiarity
about
presbyterianism
it
grows
best
where
the
soil
is
poorest
i
read
the
other
day
an
account
of
a
meeting
between
john
knox
and
john
calvin
imagine
a
dialogue
between
a
pestilence
and
a
famine
imagine
a
conversation
between
a
block
and
an
ax
as
i
read
their
conversation
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
john
knox
and
john
calvin
were
made
for
each
other
that
they
fitted
each
other
like
the
upper
and
lower
jaws
of
a
wild
beast
they
believed
happiness
was
a
crime
they
looked
upon
laughter
as
blasphemy
and
they
did
all
they
could
to
destroy
every
human
feeling
and
to
fill
the
mind
with
the
infinite
gloom
of
predestination
and
eternal
damnation
they
taught
the
doctrine
that
god
had
a
right
to
damn
us
because
he
made
us
that
is
just
the
reason
that
he
has
not
a
right
to
damn
us
there
is
some
dust
unconscious
dust
what
right
has
god
to
change
that
unconscious
dust
into
a
human
being
when
he
knows
that
human
being
will
sin
and
he
knows
that
human
being
will
suffer
eternal
agony
why
not
leave
him
in
the
unconscious
dust
what
right
has
an
infinite
god
to
add
to
the
sum
of
human
agony
suppose
i
knew
that
i
could
change
that
piece
of
furniture
into
a
living
sentient
human
being
and
i
knew
that
that
being
would
suffer
untold
agony
forever
if
i
did
it
i
would
be
a
fiend
i
would
leave
that
being
in
the
unconscious
dust
and
yet
we
are
told
that
we
must
believe
such
a
doctrine
or
we
are
to
be
eternally
damned
it
wo
do
in
there
was
a
division
in
this
church
and
they
had
a
lawsuit
to
see
which
was
the
church
of
god
and
they
tried
it
by
a
judge
and
jury
and
the
jury
decided
that
the
new
school
was
the
church
of
god
and
then
they
got
a
new
trial
and
the
next
jury
decided
that
the
old
school
was
the
church
of
god
and
that
settled
it
that
church
teaches
that
infinite
innocence
was
sacrificed
for
me
i
do
want
it
i
do
wish
to
go
to
heaven
unless
i
can
settle
by
the
books
and
go
there
because
i
ought
to
go
there
i
have
said
and
i
say
again
i
do
want
to
be
a
charity
angel
i
have
no
ambition
to
become
a
winged
pauper
of
the
skies
the
other
day
a
young
gentleman
a
presbyterian
who
had
just
been
converted
came
to
me
and
gave
me
a
tract
and
he
told
me
he
was
perfectly
happy
ugh
says
i
do
you
think
a
great
many
people
are
going
to
hell
oh
yes
and
you
are
perfectly
happy
well
he
did
know
as
he
was
quite
would
you
be
happier
if
they
were
all
going
to
heaven
o
yes
well
then
you
are
not
perfectly
happy
no
he
did
think
he
was
says
i
when
you
get
to
heaven
then
you
would
be
perfectly
happy
oh
yes
now
when
we
are
only
going
to
hell
you
are
not
quite
happy
but
when
we
are
in
hell
and
you
in
heaven
then
you
will
be
perfectly
happy
you
wo
be
as
decent
when
you
get
to
be
an
angel
as
you
are
now
will
you
well
he
said
that
was
not
exactly
it
said
i
suppose
your
mother
were
in
hell
would
you
be
happy
in
heaven
then
well
he
says
i
suppose
god
would
know
the
best
place
for
mother
and
i
thought
to
myself
then
if
i
was
a
woman
i
would
like
to
have
five
or
six
boys
like
that
it
will
not
do
heaven
is
where
are
those
we
love
and
those
who
love
us
and
i
wish
to
go
to
no
world
unless
i
can
be
accompanied
by
those
who
love
me
here
talk
about
the
consolations
of
this
infamous
doctrine
the
consolations
of
a
doctrine
that
makes
a
father
say
i
can
be
happy
with
my
daughter
in
hell
that
makes
a
mother
say
i
can
be
happy
with
my
generous
brave
boy
in
hell
that
makes
a
boy
say
i
can
enjoy
the
glory
of
heaven
with
the
woman
who
bore
me
the
woman
who
would
have
died
for
me
in
eternal
agony
and
they
call
that
tidings
of
great
joy
i
have
not
time
to
speak
of
the
baptists
that
jeremy
taylor
said
were
as
much
to
be
rooted
out
as
anything
that
is
the
greatest
pest
and
nuisance
on
the
earth
nor
of
the
quakers
the
best
of
all
and
abused
by
all
i
can
not
forget
that
george
fox
in
the
year
of
grace
was
put
in
the
pillory
and
whipped
from
town
to
town
scarred
put
in
a
dungeon
beaten
trampled
upon
and
what
for
simply
because
he
preached
the
doctrine
thou
shalt
not
resist
evil
with
evil
thou
shalt
love
thy
enemies
think
what
the
church
must
have
been
that
day
to
scar
the
flesh
of
that
loving
man
just
think
of
it
i
say
i
have
not
time
to
speak
of
all
these
sects
and
of
the
varieties
of
presbyterians
and
campbellites
the
people
who
think
they
must
dive
in
order
to
go
up
there
are
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
these
sects
all
founded
upon
this
creed
that
i
read
differing
simply
in
degree
ah
but
they
say
to
me
you
are
fighting
something
that
is
dead
nobody
believes
this
now
the
preachers
do
not
believe
what
they
preach
in
the
pulpit
the
people
in
the
pews
do
not
believe
what
they
hear
preached
and
they
say
to
me
you
are
fighting
something
that
is
dead
this
is
all
a
form
we
do
not
believe
a
solitary
creed
in
it
we
sign
it
and
swear
that
we
believe
it
but
we
do
and
none
of
us
do
and
all
the
ministers
they
say
in
private
admit
that
they
do
not
believe
it
not
quite
i
do
know
whether
this
is
so
or
not
i
take
it
that
they
believe
what
they
preach
i
take
it
that
when
they
meet
and
solemnly
agree
to
a
creed
i
take
it
they
are
honest
and
solemnly
believe
in
that
creed
the
evangelical
alliance
made
up
of
all
orthodox
denominations
of
the
world
met
only
a
few
years
ago
and
here
is
their
creed
they
believe
in
the
divine
inspiration
authority
and
sufficiency
of
the
holy
scriptures
the
right
and
duty
of
private
judgment
in
the
interpretation
of
holy
scriptures
but
if
you
interpret
wrong
you
are
damned
they
believe
in
the
unity
of
the
godhead
and
the
trinity
of
the
persons
therein
they
believe
in
the
utter
depravity
of
human
nature
there
can
be
no
more
infamous
doctrine
than
that
they
look
upon
a
little
child
as
a
lump
of
depravity
i
look
upon
it
as
a
bud
of
humanity
that
will
under
proper
circumstances
blossom
into
rich
and
glorious
life
total
depravity
of
human
nature
here
is
a
woman
whose
husband
has
been
lost
at
sea
the
news
comes
that
he
has
been
drowned
by
the
waves
and
she
waits
there
is
something
in
her
heart
that
tells
her
he
is
alive
and
she
waits
and
years
afterwards
as
she
looks
down
toward
the
little
gate
she
sees
him
he
has
been
given
back
by
the
sea
and
she
rushes
to
his
arms
and
covers
his
face
with
kisses
and
with
tears
and
if
that
infamous
doctrine
is
true
every
tear
is
a
crime
and
every
kiss
a
blasphemy
it
wo
do
according
to
that
doctrine
if
a
man
steals
and
repents
and
takes
back
the
property
the
repentance
and
the
taking
back
of
the
property
are
two
other
crimes
if
he
is
totally
depraved
it
is
an
infamy
what
else
do
they
believe
the
justification
of
a
sinner
by
faith
alone
without
works
just
faith
believing
something
that
you
do
understand
of
course
god
can
not
afford
to
reward
a
man
for
believing
anything
that
is
reasonable
god
rewards
only
for
believing
something
that
is
unreasonable
if
you
believe
something
that
you
know
is
not
so
what
else
they
believe
in
the
eternal
blessedness
of
the
righteous
and
in
the
eternal
punishment
of
the
wicked
tidings
of
great
joy
they
are
so
good
that
they
will
not
associate
with
universalists
they
will
not
associate
with
unitarians
they
will
not
associate
with
scientists
they
will
only
associate
with
those
who
believed
that
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
made
up
his
mind
to
damn
the
most
of
us
then
they
say
to
me
what
do
you
propose
you
have
torn
this
down
what
do
you
propose
to
give
in
the
place
of
it
i
have
not
torn
the
good
down
i
have
only
endeavored
to
trample
out
the
ignorant
cruel
fires
of
hell
i
do
not
tear
away
the
passage
god
will
be
merciful
to
the
merciful
i
do
not
destroy
the
promise
if
you
will
forgive
others
god
will
forgive
you
i
would
not
for
anything
blot
out
the
faintest
stars
that
shine
in
the
horizon
of
human
despair
nor
in
the
horizon
of
human
hope
but
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
get
that
infinite
shadow
out
of
the
heart
of
man
what
do
you
propose
to
put
in
place
of
this
well
in
the
first
place
i
propose
good
fellowship
good
friends
all
around
no
matter
what
we
believe
shake
hands
and
let
it
go
that
is
your
opinion
this
is
mine
let
us
be
friends
science
makes
friends
religion
superstition
makes
enemies
they
say
belief
is
important
i
say
no
good
actions
are
important
judge
by
deed
not
by
creed
good
fellowship
we
have
had
too
many
of
these
solemn
people
whenever
i
see
an
exceedingly
solemn
man
i
know
he
is
an
exceedingly
stupid
man
no
man
of
any
humor
ever
founded
any
religion
never
humor
sees
both
sides
while
reason
is
the
holy
light
humor
carries
the
lantern
and
the
man
with
a
keen
sense
of
humor
is
preserved
from
the
solemn
stupidities
of
superstition
i
like
a
man
who
has
got
good
feeling
for
everybody
good
fellowship
one
man
said
to
another
will
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
i
do
drink
will
you
smoke
a
cigar
i
do
smoke
maybe
you
will
chew
something
i
do
chew
let
us
eat
some
hay
i
tell
you
i
do
eat
hay
well
then
for
you
are
no
company
for
man
or
beast
i
believe
in
the
gospel
of
cheerfulness
the
gospel
of
good
nature
the
gospel
of
good
health
let
us
pray
to
our
bodies
take
care
of
our
bodies
and
our
souls
will
take
care
of
themselves
good
health
and
i
believe
that
the
time
will
come
when
the
public
thought
will
be
so
great
and
grand
that
it
will
be
looked
upon
as
infamous
to
perpetuate
disease
i
believe
the
time
will
come
when
man
will
not
fill
the
future
with
consumption
and
insanity
i
believe
the
time
will
come
when
we
study
ourselves
and
understand
the
laws
of
health
that
we
will
say
we
are
under
obligation
to
put
the
flags
of
health
in
the
cheeks
of
our
children
even
if
i
got
to
heaven
and
had
a
harp
i
would
hate
to
look
back
upon
my
children
and
grandchildren
and
see
them
diseased
deformed
crazed
all
suffering
the
penalties
of
crimes
i
had
committed
i
then
believe
in
the
gospel
of
good
health
and
i
believe
in
a
gospel
of
good
living
you
can
not
make
any
god
happy
by
fasting
let
us
have
good
food
and
let
us
have
it
well
cooked
and
it
is
a
thousand
times
better
to
know
how
to
cook
it
than
it
is
to
understand
any
theology
in
the
world
i
believe
in
the
gospel
of
good
clothes
i
believe
in
the
gospel
of
good
houses
in
the
gospel
of
water
and
soap
i
believe
in
the
gospel
of
intelligence
in
the
gospel
of
education
the
is
my
cathedral
the
universe
is
my
bible
i
believe
in
that
gospel
of
justice
that
we
must
reap
what
we
sow
i
do
not
believe
in
forgiveness
if
i
rob
smith
and
god
forgives
me
how
does
that
help
smith
if
i
by
slander
cover
some
poor
girl
with
the
leprosy
of
some
imputed
crime
and
she
withers
away
like
a
blighted
flower
and
afterward
i
get
forgiveness
how
does
that
help
her
if
there
is
another
world
we
have
got
to
settle
no
bankrupt
court
there
pay
down
the
christians
say
that
among
the
ancient
jews
if
you
committed
a
crime
you
had
to
kill
a
sheep
now
they
say
charge
it
put
it
upon
the
slate
it
wo
do
for
every
crime
you
commit
you
must
answer
to
yourself
and
to
the
one
you
injure
and
if
you
have
ever
clothed
another
with
unhappiness
as
with
a
garment
of
pain
you
will
never
be
quite
as
happy
as
though
you
done
that
thing
no
forgiveness
eternal
inexorable
everlasting
justice
that
is
what
i
believe
in
and
if
it
goes
hard
with
me
i
will
stand
it
and
i
will
stick
to
in
logic
and
i
will
bear
it
like
a
man
and
i
believe
too
in
the
gospel
of
liberty
in
giving
to
others
what
we
claim
for
ourselves
i
believe
there
is
room
everywhere
for
thought
and
the
more
liberty
you
give
away
the
more
you
will
have
in
liberty
extravagance
is
economy
let
us
be
just
let
us
be
generous
to
each
other
i
believe
in
the
gospel
of
intelligence
that
is
the
only
lever
capable
of
raising
mankind
intelligence
must
be
the
savior
of
this
world
humanity
is
the
grand
religion
and
no
god
can
put
another
in
hell
in
another
world
who
has
made
a
little
heaven
in
this
god
can
not
make
a
man
miserable
if
that
man
has
made
somebody
else
happy
god
can
not
hate
anybody
who
is
capable
of
loving
anybody
so
i
believe
in
this
great
gospel
of
generosity
ah
but
they
say
it
wo
do
you
must
believe
i
say
no
my
gospel
of
health
will
bring
life
my
gospel
of
intelligence
my
gospel
of
good
living
my
gospel
of
will
cover
the
world
with
happy
homes
my
doctrine
will
put
carpets
upon
your
floors
pictures
upon
your
walls
my
doctrine
will
put
books
upon
your
shelves
ideas
in
your
minds
my
doctrine
will
rid
the
world
of
the
abnormal
monsters
born
of
the
ignorance
of
superstition
my
doctrine
will
give
us
health
wealth
and
happiness
that
is
what
i
want
that
is
what
i
believe
in
give
us
intelligence
in
a
little
while
a
man
may
find
that
he
can
not
steal
without
robbing
himself
he
will
find
that
he
can
not
murder
without
assassinating
his
own
joy
he
will
find
that
every
crime
is
a
mistake
he
will
find
that
only
that
man
carries
the
cross
who
does
wrong
and
that
the
man
who
does
right
the
cross
turns
to
wings
upon
his
shoulders
that
will
bear
him
upwards
forever
he
will
find
that
intelligent
embraces
within
its
mighty
arms
all
the
human
race
oh
but
they
say
to
me
you
take
away
immortality
i
do
not
if
we
are
immortal
it
is
a
fact
in
nature
and
we
are
not
indebted
to
priests
for
it
nor
to
bibles
for
it
and
it
can
not
be
destroyed
by
unbelief
as
long
as
we
love
we
will
hope
to
live
and
when
the
one
dies
that
we
love
we
will
say
oh
that
we
could
meet
again
and
whether
we
do
or
not
it
will
not
be
the
work
of
theology
it
will
be
a
fact
in
nature
i
would
not
for
my
life
destroy
one
star
of
human
hope
but
i
want
it
so
that
when
a
poor
woman
rocks
the
cradle
and
sings
a
lullaby
to
the
dimpled
darling
that
she
will
not
be
compelled
to
believe
that
chances
in
a
hundred
she
is
raising
for
hell
one
world
at
a
time
that
is
my
doctrine
it
is
said
in
the
testament
sufficient
unto
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
and
i
say
sufficient
unto
each
world
is
the
evil
thereof
and
suppose
after
all
that
death
does
end
all
next
to
eternal
joy
next
to
being
forever
with
those
we
love
and
those
who
have
loved
us
next
to
that
is
to
be
wrapt
in
the
dreamless
drapery
of
eternal
peace
next
to
external
life
is
eternal
death
upon
the
shadowy
shore
of
death
the
sea
of
trouble
casts
no
wave
eyes
that
have
been
curtained
by
the
everlasting
dark
will
never
know
again
the
touch
of
tears
lips
that
have
been
touched
by
eternal
silence
will
never
utter
another
word
of
grief
hearts
of
dust
do
not
break
the
dead
do
not
weep
and
i
had
rather
think
of
those
i
have
loved
and
those
i
have
lost
as
having
returned
as
having
become
a
part
of
the
elemental
wealth
of
the
world
i
would
rather
think
of
them
as
unconscious
dust
i
would
rather
think
of
them
as
gurgling
in
the
stream
floating
in
the
clouds
bursting
in
the
foam
of
light
upon
the
shores
of
worlds
i
would
rather
think
of
them
as
the
inanimate
and
eternally
unconscious
that
to
have
even
a
suspicion
that
their
naked
souls
had
been
clutched
by
an
orthodox
god
but
for
me
i
will
leave
the
dead
where
nature
leaves
them
and
whatever
flower
of
hope
springs
up
in
my
heart
i
will
cherish
but
i
can
not
believe
that
there
is
any
being
in
this
universe
who
has
created
a
human
soul
for
eternal
pain
and
i
would
rather
that
every
god
would
destroy
himself
i
would
rather
that
we
all
should
go
to
eternal
chaos
to
black
and
starless
night
that
that
just
one
soul
should
suffer
eternal
agony
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
if
there
is
a
god
he
will
be
merciful
to
the
merciful
upon
that
rock
i
stand
that
he
will
forgive
the
forgiving
upon
that
rock
i
stand
that
every
man
should
be
true
to
himself
and
that
there
is
no
world
no
star
in
which
honesty
is
a
crime
and
upon
that
rock
i
stand
the
honest
man
the
good
kind
sweet
woman
the
happy
child
has
nothing
to
fear
neither
in
this
world
nor
the
world
to
come
and
upon
that
rock
i
stand
ingersoll
answer
to
prof
swing
thomas
and
others
after
looking
over
the
replies
made
to
his
new
lecture
ingersoll
was
asked
by
a
tribune
reporter
what
he
thought
of
them
he
replied
as
follows
i
think
they
dodge
the
point
the
real
point
is
this
if
salvation
by
faith
is
the
real
doctrine
of
christianity
i
asked
on
sunday
before
last
and
i
still
ask
why
did
matthew
tell
it
i
still
insist
that
mark
should
have
remembered
it
and
i
shall
always
believe
that
luke
ought
at
least
to
have
noticed
it
i
was
endeavoring
to
show
that
modern
christianity
has
for
its
basis
an
interpolation
i
think
i
showed
it
the
only
gospel
on
the
orthodox
side
is
that
of
john
and
that
was
certainly
not
written
or
did
not
appear
in
its
present
form
until
long
after
the
others
were
written
i
know
very
well
that
the
catholic
church
claimed
during
the
dark
ages
and
still
claims
that
references
had
been
made
to
the
gospels
by
persons
living
in
the
first
second
and
third
centuries
but
i
believe
such
manuscripts
were
manufactured
by
the
catholic
church
for
many
years
in
europe
there
was
not
one
person
in
who
could
read
and
write
during
that
time
the
church
had
in
its
keeping
the
literature
of
our
world
they
interpolated
as
they
pleased
they
created
they
destroyed
in
other
words
they
did
whatever
in
their
opinion
was
necessary
to
substantiate
the
faith
the
gentlemen
who
saw
fit
to
reply
did
not
answer
the
question
and
i
again
call
upon
the
clergy
to
explain
to
the
people
why
if
salvation
depended
upon
belief
in
the
lord
jesus
christ
matthew
did
not
mention
it
some
one
has
said
that
christ
did
make
known
this
doctrine
of
salvation
by
belief
or
faith
until
after
his
resurrection
certainly
none
of
the
gospels
were
written
until
after
his
resurrection
and
if
he
made
that
doctrine
known
after
his
resurrection
and
before
his
ascension
it
should
have
been
in
matthew
mark
and
luke
as
well
as
john
the
replies
of
the
clergy
show
that
they
have
not
investigated
the
subject
that
they
are
not
well
acquainted
with
the
new
testament
in
other
words
they
have
not
read
it
except
with
the
regulation
theological
bias
there
is
one
thing
i
wish
to
correct
here
in
an
editorial
in
the
tribune
it
was
stated
that
i
had
admitted
that
christ
was
beyond
and
above
buddha
zoroaster
confucius
and
others
i
say
so
another
point
was
made
against
me
and
those
who
made
it
seemed
to
think
it
was
a
good
one
in
my
lecture
i
asked
why
it
was
that
the
disciples
of
christ
wrote
in
greek
whereas
in
fact
they
understood
only
hebrew
it
is
now
claimed
that
greek
was
the
language
of
jerusalem
at
that
time
that
hebrew
had
fallen
into
disuse
that
no
one
understood
it
except
the
literati
and
the
highly
educated
if
i
fell
into
an
error
upon
this
point
it
was
because
i
relied
upon
the
new
testament
i
find
in
the
chapter
of
the
acts
an
account
of
paul
having
been
mobbed
in
the
city
of
jerusalem
that
he
was
protected
by
a
chief
captain
and
some
soldiers
that
when
upon
the
stairs
of
the
castle
to
which
he
was
being
taken
for
protection
he
obtained
leave
from
the
captain
to
speak
unto
the
people
in
the
fortieth
verse
of
that
chapter
i
find
the
following
and
when
he
had
given
him
license
paul
stood
on
the
stairs
and
beckoned
with
the
hand
unto
the
people
and
when
there
was
made
a
great
silence
he
spake
unto
them
in
the
hebrew
tongue
saying
and
then
follows
the
speech
of
paul
wherein
he
gives
an
account
of
his
conversion
it
seems
a
little
curious
to
me
that
paul
for
the
purpose
of
quieting
the
mob
would
speak
to
that
mob
in
an
unknown
language
if
i
were
mobbed
in
the
city
of
chicago
and
wished
to
defend
myself
with
an
explanation
i
certainly
would
not
make
that
explanation
in
chocktaw
even
if
i
understood
that
tongue
my
present
opinion
is
that
i
would
speak
in
english
and
the
reason
i
would
speak
in
english
is
because
that
language
is
generally
understood
in
this
city
and
so
i
conclude
from
the
account
in
the
chapter
of
the
acts
that
hebrew
was
the
language
of
jerusalem
at
that
time
or
that
paul
would
not
have
addressed
the
mob
in
that
tongue
did
you
read
courtney
answer
i
read
what
courtney
read
from
others
and
think
some
of
his
quotations
very
good
and
have
no
doubt
that
the
authors
will
feel
complimented
by
being
quoted
but
what
about
there
being
belief
in
matthew
courtney
says
that
certain
people
were
cured
of
diseases
on
account
of
faith
admitting
that
mumps
measles
and
could
be
cured
in
that
way
there
is
not
even
a
suggestion
that
salvation
depended
upon
a
like
faith
i
think
he
can
hardly
afford
to
rely
upon
the
miracles
of
the
new
testament
to
prove
his
doctrine
there
is
one
instance
in
which
a
miracle
was
performed
by
christ
without
his
knowledge
and
i
hardly
think
that
even
courtney
would
insist
that
any
faith
could
have
been
great
enough
for
that
the
fact
is
i
believe
that
all
these
miracles
were
ascribed
to
christ
long
after
his
death
and
that
christ
never
at
any
time
or
place
pretended
to
have
any
supernatural
power
whatever
neither
do
i
believe
that
he
claimed
any
supernatural
origin
he
claimed
simply
to
be
a
man
no
less
no
more
i
do
believe
courtney
is
satisfied
with
his
own
reply
and
now
as
to
prof
swing
mr
swing
has
been
out
of
the
orthodox
church
so
long
that
he
seems
to
have
forgotten
the
reasons
for
which
he
left
it
i
do
believe
there
is
an
orthodox
minister
in
the
city
of
chicago
who
will
agree
with
mr
swing
that
salvation
by
faith
is
no
longer
preached
prof
swing
seems
to
think
it
of
no
importance
who
wrote
the
gospel
of
matthew
in
this
i
agree
with
him
judging
from
what
he
said
there
is
hardly
difference
enough
of
opinion
between
us
to
justify
a
reply
on
his
part
he
however
makes
one
mistake
i
did
not
in
the
lecture
say
one
word
about
tearing
churches
down
i
have
no
objection
to
people
building
all
the
churches
they
wish
while
i
admit
that
it
is
a
pretty
sight
to
see
children
on
a
morning
in
june
going
through
the
fields
to
the
country
church
i
still
insist
that
the
beauty
of
that
sight
does
answer
the
question
how
it
is
that
matthew
forgot
to
say
anything
about
salvation
through
christ
prof
swing
is
a
man
of
poetic
temperament
but
this
is
not
a
poetic
question
how
did
the
card
of
thomas
strike
you
i
think
the
reply
of
thomas
in
the
best
possible
spirit
i
regard
him
to
day
as
the
best
intellect
in
the
methodist
denomination
he
seems
to
have
what
is
generally
understood
as
a
christian
spirit
he
has
always
treated
me
with
perfect
fairness
and
i
should
have
said
long
ago
many
grateful
things
had
i
not
feared
i
might
hurt
with
his
own
people
he
seems
to
be
by
nature
a
perfectly
fair
man
and
i
know
of
no
man
in
the
united
states
for
whom
i
have
a
profounder
respect
of
course
i
do
agree
with
thomas
i
think
in
many
things
he
is
mistaken
but
i
believe
him
to
be
perfectly
sincere
there
is
one
trouble
about
him
he
is
growing
and
this
fact
will
no
doubt
give
great
trouble
to
many
of
his
brethren
certain
methodist
hazelbrush
feel
a
little
uneasy
in
the
shadow
of
his
oak
are
you
going
to
make
a
formal
reply
to
their
sermons
not
unless
something
better
is
done
than
has
been
of
course
i
know
what
another
sabbath
may
bring
forth
i
am
waiting
but
of
one
thing
i
feel
perfectly
assured
that
no
man
in
the
united
states
or
in
the
world
can
account
for
the
fact
if
we
are
to
be
saved
only
by
faith
in
christ
that
matthew
forgot
it
that
luke
said
nothing
about
it
and
that
mark
never
mentioned
it
except
in
two
passages
written
by
another
person
until
that
is
answered
as
one
says
to
the
other
in
hamlet
i
shall
say
tell
me
that
and
unyoke
in
the
meantime
i
wish
to
keep
on
the
best
terms
with
all
parties
concerned
i
can
not
see
why
my
forgiving
spirit
fails
to
gain
their
sincere
praise
