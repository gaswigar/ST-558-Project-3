preface
the
stories
included
within
this
volume
do
not
illustrate
the
bloody
revengeful
or
licentious
elements
with
which
japanese
popular
and
juvenile
literature
is
saturated
these
have
been
carefully
avoided
it
is
also
rather
with
a
view
to
the
artistic
than
to
the
literary
products
of
the
imagination
of
japan
that
the
selection
has
been
made
from
my
first
acquaintance
twelve
years
ago
with
japanese
youth
i
became
an
eager
listener
to
their
folk
lore
and
fireside
stories
when
later
during
a
residence
of
nearly
four
years
among
the
people
my
eyes
were
opened
to
behold
the
wondrous
fertility
of
invention
the
wealth
of
literary
historic
and
classic
allusion
of
pun
myth
and
riddle
of
heroic
wonder
and
legendary
lore
in
japanese
art
i
at
once
set
myself
to
find
the
source
of
the
ideas
expressed
in
bronze
and
porcelain
on
lacquered
cabinets
fans
and
even
crape
paper
napkins
and
tidies
sometimes
i
discovered
the
originals
of
the
fancy
in
books
sometimes
only
in
the
mouths
of
the
people
and
professional
some
of
these
stories
i
first
read
on
the
tattooed
limbs
and
bodies
of
the
native
others
i
first
saw
in
at
the
street
floral
shows
of
tokio
within
this
book
the
reader
will
find
translations
condensations
of
whole
books
of
interminable
romances
and
a
few
sketches
by
the
author
embodying
japanese
ideas
beliefs
and
superstitions
i
have
taken
no
more
liberty
i
think
with
the
native
originals
than
a
modern
of
tokio
would
himself
take
were
he
talking
in
an
american
parlor
instead
of
at
his
stand
in
yanagi
cho
willow
street
in
the
mikado
capital
some
of
the
stories
have
appeared
in
english
before
but
most
of
them
are
printed
for
the
first
time
a
few
reappear
from
and
other
periodicals
the
illustrations
and
though
engraved
in
new
york
by
henry
troy
were
with
one
exception
drawn
especially
for
this
work
by
my
ozawa
nankoku
of
tokio
the
picture
of
yorimasa
the
archer
was
made
for
me
by
one
of
my
students
in
tokio
hoping
that
these
harmless
stories
that
have
tickled
the
imagination
of
japanese
children
during
untold
generations
may
amuse
the
big
and
little
folks
of
america
the
writer
invites
his
readers

the

one
of

greatest
days
in

calendar
of
old
japan
was
the
seventh
of
july
or
as
the
japanese
people
put
it
the
seventh
day
of
the
seventh
month
it
was
a
vermilion
day
in
the
almanacs
to
which
every
child
looked
forward
with
eyes
sparkling
hands
clapping
and
fingers
counting
as
each
night
rolled
the
time
nearer
all
manner
of
fruits
and
other
eatable
vegetables
were
prepared
and
cakes
baked
in
the
household
the
boys
plucked
bamboo
stalks
and
strung
on
their
branches
ribbons
tinkling
bells
and
long
streamers
of
paper
on
which
poetry
was
written
on
this
night
mothers
hoped
for
wealth
happiness
good
children
and
wisdom
the
girls
made
a
wish
that
they
might
become
skilled
in
needlework
only
one
wish
a
year
however
could
be
made
so
if
any
one
wanted
several
things
health
wealth
skill
in
needlework
wisdom
they
must
wait
many
years
before
all
the
favors
could
be
granted
above
all
things
rainy
weather
was
not
desired
it
was
a
good
sign
when
a
spider
spun
his
web
over
a
melon
or
if
put
in
a
square
box
he
should
weave
a
circular
web
now
the
cause
of
all
this
preparation
was
that
on
the
seventh
of
july
the
star
and
the
spinning
maiden
star
cross
the
milky
way
to
meet
each
other
these
are
the
stars
which
we
call
capricornus
and
alpha
lyra
these
stars
that
shine
and
glitter
so
far
up
in
the
zenith
are
the
boy
with
an
ox
and
the
girl
with
a
shuttle
about
whom
the
story
runs
as
follows
on
the
banks
of
the
silver
river
of
heaven
which
we
call
the
milky
way
there
lived
a
beautiful
maiden
who
was
the
daughter
of
the
sun
her
name
was
shokujo
she
did
not
care
for
games
or
play
like
her
companions
and
thinking
nothing
of
vain
display
wore
only
the
simplest
of
dress
yet
she
was
very
diligent
and
made
many
garments
for
others
indeed
so
busy
was
she
that
all
called
her
the
weaving
or
spinning
princess
the
noticed
the
serious
disposition
and
close
habits
of
his
daughter
and
tried
in
various
ways
to
get
her
to
be
more
lively
at
last
he
thought
to
marry
her
as
marriages
in
the
are
usually
planned
by
the
parents
and
not
by
the
foolish
and
girls
he
arranged
the
union
without
consulting
his
daughter
the
young
man
on
whom
the
thus
bestowed
his
daughter
hand
was
kingin
who
kept
a
herd
of
cows
on
the
banks
of
the
celestial
stream
he
had
always
been
a
good
neighbor
and
living
on
the
same
side
of
the
river
the
father
thought
he
would
get
a
nice
and
at
the
same
time
improve
his
daughter
habits
and
disposition
no
sooner
did
the
maiden
become
wife
than
her
habits
and
character
utterly
changed
for
the
worse
and
the
father
had
a
very
vexatious
case
of
too
much
of
a
good
thing
on
his
hands
the
wife
became
not
only
very
merry
and
lively
but
utterly
forsook
loom
and
needle
she
gave
up
her
nights
and
days
to
play
and
idleness
and
no
silly
lover
could
have
been
more
foolish
than
she
the
became
very
much
offended
at
all
this
and
thinking
that
the
husband
was
the
cause
of
it
he
determined
to
separate
the
couple
so
he
ordered
the
husband
to
remove
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
of
stars
and
told
him
that
hereafter
they
should
meet
only
once
a
year
on
the
seventh
night
of
the
seventh
month
to
make
a
bridge
over
the
flood
of
stars
the
called
myriads
of
magpies
which
thereupon
flew
together
and
making
a
bridge
supported
him
on
their
wings
and
backs
as
if
it
were
a
roadway
of
solid
land
so
bidding
his
weeping
wife
farewell
the
sorrowfully
crossed
the
river
of
heaven
no
sooner
had
he
set
foot
on
the
opposite
side
than
the
magpies
flew
away
filling
all
the
heavens
with
their
chatter
the
weeping
wife
and
stood
for
a
long
time
wistfully
gazing
at
each
other
from
afar
then
they
separated
the
one
to
lead
his
ox
the
other
to
ply
her
shuttle
during
the
long
hours
of
the
day
with
diligent
toil
thus
they
filled
the
hours
and
the
again
rejoiced
in
his
industry
but
when
night
fell
and
all
the
lamps
of
heaven
were
lighted
the
lovers
would
come
and
stand
by
the
banks
of
the
starry
river
and
gaze
longingly
at
each
other
waiting
for
the
seventh
night
of
the
seventh
month
at
last
the
time
drew
near
and
only
one
fear
possessed
the
loving
wife
every
time
she
thought
of
it
her
heart
played
faster
what
if
it
should
rain
for
the
river
of
heaven
is
always
full
to
the
brim
and
one
extra
drop
of
rain
causes
a
flood
which
sweeps
away
even
the
illustration
the
meeting
on
the
bridge
of
birds
but
not
a
drop
fell
the
seventh
month
seventh
night
came
and
all
the
heavens
were
clear
the
magpies
flew
joyfully
in
myriads
making
one
way
for
the
tiny
feet
of
the
little
lady
trembling
with
joy
and
with
heart
fluttering
more
than
the
bridge
of
wings
she
crossed
the
river
of
heaven
and
was
in
the
arms
of
her
husband
this
she
did
every
year
the
stayed
on
his
side
of
the
river
and
the
wife
came
to
him
on
the
magpie
bridge
save
on
the
sad
occasion
when
it
rained
so
every
year
the
people
hope
for
clear
weather
and
the
happy
festival
is
celebrated
alike
by
old
and
young
the
travels
of
two
frogs
forty
miles
apart
as
the
cranes
fly
stand
the
great
cities
of
ozaka
and
kioto
the
one
is
the
city
of
canals
and
bridges
its
streets
are
full
of
bustling
trade
and
its
waterways
are
ever
alive
with
gondolas
shooting
hither
and
thither
like
the
wooden
shuttles
in
a
loom
the
other
is
the
sacred
city
of
the
mikado
empire
girdled
with
green
hills
and
a
circle
of
flowers
in
its
quiet
clean
streets
laid
out
like
a
chessboard
walk
the
shaven
monks
and
gowned
scholars
and
very
beautiful
is
kioto
with
pretty
girls
and
temple
gardens
and
castle
walls
and
towers
and
moats
in
which
the
white
lotus
blooms
long
long
ago
in
the
good
old
days
before
the
and
men
from
over
the
sea
of
great
peace
pacific
ocean
came
to
japan
before
the
black
and
snorting
engine
scared
the
white
heron
from
the
before
black
crows
and
fighting
sparrows
which
fear
not
man
perched
on
telegraph
wires
or
ever
a
railway
was
thought
of
there
lived
two
frogs
one
in
a
well
in
kioto
the
other
in
a
in
ozaka
now
it
is
a
common
proverb
in
the
land
of
the
gods
japan
that
the
frog
in
the
well
knows
not
the
great
ocean
and
the
kioto
frog
had
so
often
heard
this
scornful
sneer
from
the
maids
who
came
to
draw
out
water
with
their
long
buckets
that
he
resolved
to
travel
abroad
and
see
the
world
and
especially
the
the
great
ocean
i
see
for
myself
said
frog
as
he
packed
his
wallet
and
wiped
his
spectacles
what
this
great
ocean
is
that
they
talk
about
wager
it
is
half
as
deep
or
wide
as
well
where
i
can
see
the
stars
even
at
daylight
now
the
truth
was
a
recent
earthquake
had
greatly
reduced
the
depth
of
the
well
and
the
water
was
getting
very
shallow
frog
informed
his
family
of
his
intentions
frog
wept
a
great
deal
but
drying
her
eyes
with
her
paper
handkerchief
she
declared
she
would
count
the
hours
on
her
fingers
till
he
came
back
and
at
every
morning
and
evening
meal
would
set
out
his
table
with
food
on
it
just
as
if
he
were
home
she
tied
up
a
little
lacquered
box
full
of
boiled
rice
and
snails
for
his
journey
wrapped
it
around
with
a
silk
napkin
and
putting
his
extra
clothes
in
a
bundle
swung
it
on
his
back
tying
it
over
his
neck
he
seized
his
staff
and
was
ready
to
go
cried
he
as
with
a
tear
in
his
eye
he
walked
away
walk
slowly
croaked
frog
and
the
whole
family
of
young
frogs
in
a
chorus
two
of
the
froggies
were
still
babies
that
is
they
were
yet
polywogs
with
a
half
inch
of
tail
still
on
them
and
of
course
were
carried
about
by
being
strapped
on
the
back
of
their
older
brothers
frog
being
now
on
land
out
of
his
well
noticed
that
the
other
animals
did
not
leap
but
walked
on
their
legs
and
not
wishing
to
be
eccentric
he
likewise
began
briskly
walking
upright
on
his
hind
legs
or
waddling
on
all
fours
now
it
happened
that
about
the
same
time
the
ozaka
father
frog
had
become
restless
and
dissatisfied
with
life
on
the
edges
of
his
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
cast
the
lion
cub
into
the
valley
why
that
tall
talk
for
a
frog
i
must
say
exclaims
the
reader
what
did
he
mean
i
must
tell
you
that
the
ozaka
frog
was
a
philosopher
right
at
the
edge
of
his
was
a
monastery
full
of
buddhist
monks
who
every
day
studied
their
sacred
rolls
and
droned
over
the
books
of
confucius
to
learn
them
by
heart
our
frog
had
heard
them
so
often
that
he
could
in
frog
language
of
course
repeat
many
of
their
wise
sentences
and
intone
responses
to
their
evening
prayers
put
up
by
the
great
idol
amida
indeed
our
frog
had
so
often
listened
to
their
debates
on
texts
from
the
classics
that
he
had
himself
become
a
sage
and
a
philosopher
yet
as
the
proverb
says
the
sage
is
not
happy
why
not
in
spite
of
a
soft
plenty
of
green
scum
stagnant
water
and
shady
lotus
leaves
a
fat
wife
and
a
numerous
family
in
short
everything
to
make
a
frog
happy
his
forehead
or
rather
gullet
was
wrinkled
with
care
from
long
pondering
of
knotty
problems
such
as
the
following
the
monks
often
come
down
to
the
edge
of
the
pond
to
look
at
the
pink
and
white
lotus
one
summer
day
as
a
little
frog
hardly
out
of
his
tadpole
state
with
a
small
fragment
of
tail
still
left
sat
basking
on
a
huge
round
leaf
one
monk
said
to
the
other
of
what
does
that
remind
you
the
babies
of
frogs
will
become
but
frogs
said
one
shaven
pate
laughing
what
think
you
the
white
lotus
flower
springs
out
of
the
black
mud
said
the
other
solemnly
as
both
walked
away
the
old
frog
sitting
near
by
overheard
them
and
began
to
philosophize
humph
the
babies
of
frogs
will
become
but
frogs
hey
if
mud
becomes
lotus
why
should
a
frog
become
a
man
why
not
if
my
pet
son
should
travel
abroad
and
see
the
world
go
to
kioto
for
instance
why
he
be
as
wise
as
those
men
i
wonder
i
shall
try
it
anyhow
i
send
my
son
on
a
journey
to
kioto
i
the
lion
cub
into
the
valley
send
the
pet
son
abroad
in
the
world
to
see
and
study
at
once
i
deny
myself
for
the
sake
of
my
offspring
flump
splash
sounded
the
water
as
a
pair
of
webby
feet
disappeared
the
lion
cub
was
soon
ready
after
much
paternal
advice
and
much
counsel
to
beware
of
being
gobbled
up
by
storks
and
trod
on
by
impolite
men
and
struck
at
by
bad
boys
ni
no
even
in
the
capital
there
are
boors
said
father
frog
now
it
so
happened
that
the
old
frog
from
kioto
and
the
lion
cub
from
ozaka
started
each
from
his
home
at
the
same
time
nothing
of
importance
occurred
to
either
of
them
until
as
luck
would
have
it
they
met
on
a
hill
near
hashimoto
which
is
half
way
between
the
two
cities
both
were
footsore
and
websore
and
very
tired
especially
about
the
hips
on
account
of
the
unfroglike
manner
of
walking
instead
of
hopping
as
they
had
been
used
to
said
the
lion
cub
to
the
old
frog
as
he
fell
on
all
fours
and
bowed
his
head
to
the
ground
three
times
squinting
up
over
his
left
eye
to
see
if
the
other
frog
was
paying
equal
deference
in
return
konnichi
yes
replied
the
kioto
frog
it
is
rather
fine
weather
said
the
cub
yoi
tenki
yes
it
is
very
fine
replied
the
old
fellow
i
am
gamataro
from
ozaka
the
oldest
son
of
hiki
dono
sensui
no
kami
lord
bullfrog
prince
of
the
your
lordship
must
be
weary
with
your
journey
i
am
kayeru
san
of
idomidzu
sir
frog
of
the
well
in
kioto
i
started
out
to
see
the
ocean
from
ozaka
but
i
declare
my
hips
are
so
dreadfully
tired
that
i
believe
that
i
give
up
my
plan
and
content
myself
with
a
look
from
this
hill
the
truth
must
be
owned
that
the
old
frog
was
not
only
on
his
hind
legs
but
also
on
his
last
legs
when
he
stood
up
to
look
at
ozaka
while
the
cub
was
tired
enough
to
believe
anything
the
old
fellow
wiping
his
face
spoke
up
suppose
we
save
ourselves
the
trouble
of
the
journey
this
hill
is
half
way
between
the
two
cities
and
while
i
see
ozaka
and
the
sea
you
can
get
a
good
look
of
the
kio
capital
or
kioto
happy
thought
said
the
ozaka
frog
then
both
reared
themselves
upon
their
and
stretching
upon
their
toes
body
to
body
and
neck
to
neck
propped
each
other
up
rolled
their
goggles
and
looked
steadily
as
they
supposed
on
the
places
which
they
each
wished
to
see
now
everyone
knows
that
a
frog
has
eyes
mounted
in
that
part
of
his
head
which
is
front
when
he
is
down
and
back
when
he
stands
up
they
are
set
like
a
compass
on
gimbals
long
and
steadily
they
gazed
until
at
last
their
toes
being
tired
they
fell
down
on
all
fours
i
declare
said
the
old
daddy
ozaka
looks
just
like
kioto
and
as
for
great
ocean
those
stupid
maids
talked
about
i
do
see
any
at
all
unless
they
mean
that
strip
of
river
that
looks
for
all
the
world
like
the
yodo
i
do
believe
there
is
any
ocean
as
for
my
part
said
the
i
am
satisfied
that
it
all
folly
to
go
further
for
kioto
is
as
like
ozaka
as
one
grain
of
rice
is
like
another
then
he
said
to
himself
old
totsu
san
my
father
is
a
fool
with
all
his
philosophy
thereupon
both
congratulated
themselves
upon
the
happy
expedient
by
which
they
had
spared
themselves
a
long
journey
much
and
some
danger
they
departed
after
exchanging
many
compliments
and
dropping
again
into
a
frog
hop
they
leaped
back
in
half
the
time
the
one
to
his
well
and
the
other
to
his
pond
there
each
told
the
story
of
both
cities
looking
exactly
alike
thus
demonstrating
the
folly
of
those
foolish
folks
called
men
as
for
the
old
gentleman
in
the
he
was
so
glad
to
get
the
cub
back
again
that
he
never
again
tried
to
reason
out
the
problems
of
philosophy
and
to
this
day
the
frog
in
the
well
knows
not
and
believes
not
in
the
great
ocean
still
do
the
babies
of
frogs
become
but
frogs
still
is
it
vain
to
teach
the
reptiles
philosophy
for
all
such
labor
is
like
pouring
water
in
a
frog
face
still
out
of
the
black
mud
springs
the
glorious
white
lotus
in
celestial
purity
unfolding
its
stainless
petals
to
the
smiling
heavens
the
emblem
of
life
and
resurrection
the
child
of
the
thunder
in
among
the
hills
of
echizen
within
sight
of
the
snowy
mountain
called
hakuzan
lived
a
farmer
named
bimbo
he
was
very
poor
but
frugal
and
industrious
he
was
very
fond
of
children
though
he
had
none
himself
he
longed
to
adopt
a
son
to
bear
his
name
and
often
talked
the
matter
over
with
his
old
dame
but
being
so
dreadfully
poor
both
thought
it
best
not
to
adopt
until
they
had
bettered
their
condition
and
increased
the
area
of
their
land
for
all
the
property
bimbo
owned
was
the
earth
in
a
little
gully
which
he
himself
was
reclaiming
a
tiny
rivulet
flowing
from
a
spring
in
the
crevice
of
the
rocks
above
after
trickling
over
the
boulders
rolled
down
the
gully
to
join
a
brook
in
the
larger
valley
below
bimbo
had
with
great
labor
after
many
years
made
dams
or
terraces
of
stone
inside
which
he
had
thrown
soil
partly
got
from
the
mountain
sides
but
mainly
carried
in
baskets
on
the
backs
of
himself
and
his
wife
from
the
valley
below
by
such
weary
toil
continued
year
in
and
year
out
small
beds
of
soil
were
formed
in
which
rice
could
be
planted
and
grown
the
little
rivulet
supplied
the
needful
water
for
rice
the
daily
food
of
laborer
and
farmer
must
be
planted
and
cultivated
in
soft
mud
under
water
so
the
little
rivulet
which
once
leaped
over
the
rock
and
cut
its
way
singing
to
the
valley
now
spread
itself
quietly
over
each
terrace
making
more
than
a
dozen
descents
before
it
reached
the
fields
below
yet
after
all
his
toil
for
a
score
of
years
working
every
day
from
the
first
croak
of
the
raven
until
the
stars
came
out
bimbo
and
his
wife
owned
only
three
acre
of
terrace
land
sometimes
a
summer
would
pass
and
little
or
no
rain
fall
then
the
rivulet
dried
up
and
crops
failed
it
seemed
all
in
vain
that
their
backs
were
bent
and
their
foreheads
seamed
and
wrinkled
with
care
many
a
time
did
bimbo
have
hard
work
of
it
even
to
pay
his
taxes
which
sometimes
amounted
to
half
his
crop
many
a
time
did
he
shake
his
head
muttering
the
discouraged
farmer
proverb
a
new
field
gives
a
scant
crop
the
words
of
which
mean
also
human
life
is
but
fifty
years
one
summer
day
after
a
long
drought
when
the
young
rice
sprouts
just
transplanted
were
turning
yellow
at
the
tips
the
clouds
began
to
gather
and
roll
and
soon
a
smart
shower
fell
the
lightning
glittered
and
the
hills
echoed
with
claps
of
thunder
but
bimbo
hoe
in
hand
was
so
glad
to
see
the
rain
fall
and
the
pattering
drops
felt
so
cool
and
refreshing
that
he
worked
on
strengthening
the
terrace
to
resist
the
little
flood
about
to
come
pretty
soon
the
storm
rattled
very
near
him
and
he
thought
he
had
better
seek
shelter
lest
the
thunder
should
strike
and
kill
him
for
bimbo
like
all
his
neighbors
had
often
heard
stories
of
kaijin
the
god
of
the
who
lives
in
the
skies
and
rides
on
the
storm
and
sometimes
kills
people
by
throwing
out
of
the
clouds
at
them
a
terrible
creature
like
a
cat
with
claws
and
a
hairy
body
just
as
bimbo
threw
his
hoe
over
his
shoulder
and
started
to
move
a
terrible
blinding
flash
of
lightning
dazzled
his
eyes
it
was
immediately
followed
by
a
deafening
crash
and
the
thunder
fell
just
in
front
of
him
he
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
but
finding
himself
unhurt
uttered
a
prayer
of
thanks
to
buddha
for
safety
then
he
uncovered
his
eyes
and
looked
down
at
his
feet
there
lay
a
little
boy
rosy
and
warm
and
crowing
in
the
most
lively
manner
and
never
minding
the
rain
in
the
least
the
farmer
eyes
opened
very
wide
but
happy
and
nearly
surprised
out
of
his
senses
he
picked
up
the
child
tenderly
in
his
arms
and
took
him
home
to
his
old
wife
here
a
gift
from
raijin
said
bimbo
we
adopt
him
as
our
own
son
and
call
him
the
darling
of
the
thunder
so
the
boy
grew
up
and
became
a
very
dutiful
and
loving
child
he
was
as
kind
and
obedient
to
his
as
though
he
had
been
born
in
their
house
he
never
liked
to
play
with
other
children
but
kept
all
day
in
the
fields
with
his
father
sporting
with
the
rivulet
and
looking
at
the
clouds
and
sky
even
when
the
strolling
players
of
the
dai
kagura
the
comedy
which
makes
the
gods
laugh
and
the
lion
of
corea
came
into
the
village
and
every
boy
and
girl
and
nurse
and
woman
was
sure
to
be
out
in
great
glee
the
child
of
the
thunder
stayed
up
in
the
field
or
climbed
on
the
high
rocks
to
watch
the
sailing
of
the
birds
and
the
flowing
of
the
water
and
the
river
far
away
great
prosperity
seemed
to
come
to
the
farmer
and
he
laid
it
all
to
the
sweet
child
that
fell
to
him
from
the
clouds
it
was
very
curious
that
rain
often
fell
on
bimbo
field
when
none
fell
elsewhere
so
that
bimbo
grew
rich
and
changed
his
name
to
kanemochi
he
believed
that
the
boy
raitaro
beckoned
to
the
clouds
and
they
shed
their
rain
for
him
a
good
many
summers
passed
by
and
raitaro
had
grown
to
be
a
tall
and
handsome
lad
almost
a
man
and
eighteen
years
old
on
his
birthday
the
old
farmer
and
the
good
wife
made
a
little
feast
for
their
they
ate
and
drank
and
talked
of
the
out
of
which
raitaro
was
born
finally
the
young
man
said
solemnly
my
dear
parents
i
thank
you
very
much
for
your
kindness
to
me
but
i
must
now
say
farewell
i
hope
you
will
always
be
happy
then
in
a
moment
all
trace
of
a
human
form
disappeared
and
floating
in
the
air
they
saw
a
tiny
white
dragon
which
hovered
for
a
moment
above
them
and
then
flew
away
the
old
couple
went
out
of
doors
to
watch
it
when
it
grew
bigger
and
bigger
taking
its
course
to
the
hills
above
where
the
white
clouds
which
form
on
a
summer
afternoon
seemed
built
up
like
towers
and
castles
of
silver
towards
one
of
these
the
dragon
moved
until
as
they
watched
his
form
now
grown
to
a
mighty
size
it
disappeared
from
view
after
this
kanemochi
and
his
wife
who
were
now
old
and
ceased
from
their
toil
and
lived
in
comfort
all
their
days
when
they
died
and
their
bodies
were
reduced
to
a
heap
of
white
cinders
in
the
stone
furnace
of
the
village
their
ashes
were
mixed
and
being
put
into
one
urn
were
laid
away
in
the
cemetery
of
the
temple
yard
their
tomb
was
carved
in
the
form
of
a
white
dragon
which
to
this
day
in
spite
of
mosses
and
lichens
may
still
be
seen
among
the
ancient
monuments
of
the
little
hamlet
the
sparrow
there
was
once
an
old
man
who
had
a
wife
with
a
very
bad
temper
she
had
never
borne
him
any
children
and
would
not
take
the
trouble
to
adopt
a
son
so
for
a
little
pet
he
kept
a
tiny
sparrow
and
fed
it
with
great
care
the
old
dame
not
satisfied
with
scolding
her
husband
hated
the
sparrow
now
the
old
woman
temper
was
especially
bad
on
wash
days
when
her
old
back
and
knees
were
well
strained
over
the
low
tub
which
rested
on
the
ground
it
happened
once
that
she
had
made
some
starch
and
set
it
in
a
red
wooden
bowl
to
cool
while
her
back
was
turned
the
sparrow
hopped
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bowl
and
pecked
at
some
of
the
starch
in
a
rage
the
old
hag
seized
a
pair
of
scissors
and
cut
the
sparrow
tongue
out
flinging
the
bird
in
the
air
she
cried
out
now
be
off
so
the
poor
sparrow
all
bleeding
flew
away
when
the
old
man
came
back
and
found
his
pet
gone
he
made
a
great
ado
he
asked
his
wife
and
she
told
him
what
she
had
done
and
why
the
sorrowful
old
man
grieved
sorely
for
his
pet
and
after
looking
in
every
place
and
calling
it
by
name
gave
it
up
as
lost
long
after
this
old
man
while
wandering
on
the
mountains
met
his
old
friend
the
sparrow
they
both
cried
ohio
good
morning
to
each
other
and
bowing
low
offered
many
mutual
congratulations
and
inquiries
as
to
health
etc
then
the
sparrow
begged
the
old
man
to
visit
his
humble
abode
promising
to
introduce
his
wife
and
two
daughters
the
old
man
went
in
and
found
a
nice
little
house
with
a
bamboo
garden
tiny
waterfall
stepping
stone
and
everything
complete
then
sparrow
brought
in
slices
of
sweet
potato
custard
and
a
bowl
of
hot
starch
sprinkled
with
sugar
and
a
pair
of
chopsticks
on
a
tray
miss
suzumi
the
elder
daughter
brought
the
tea
caddy
and
and
in
a
snap
of
the
fingers
had
a
good
cup
of
tea
ready
which
she
offered
on
a
tray
kneeling
please
take
up
and
help
yourself
the
refreshments
are
very
poor
but
i
hope
you
will
excuse
our
plainness
said
mother
sparrow
the
delighted
old
man
wondering
in
himself
at
such
a
polite
family
of
sparrows
ate
heartily
and
drank
several
cups
of
tea
finally
on
being
pressed
he
remained
all
night
for
several
days
the
old
man
enjoyed
himself
at
the
sparrow
home
he
looked
at
the
landscapes
and
the
moonlight
feasted
to
his
content
and
played
the
game
of
checkers
with
the
little
daughter
in
the
evening
sparrow
would
bring
out
the
refreshments
and
the
wine
and
seat
the
old
man
on
a
silken
cushion
while
she
played
the
guitar
sparrow
and
his
two
daughters
danced
sung
and
made
merry
the
delighted
old
man
leaning
on
the
velvet
forgot
his
cares
his
old
limbs
and
his
wife
tongue
and
felt
like
a
youth
again
on
the
fifth
day
the
old
man
said
he
must
go
home
then
the
sparrow
brought
out
two
baskets
made
of
plaited
rattan
such
as
are
used
in
traveling
and
carried
on
men
shoulders
placing
them
before
their
guest
the
sparrow
said
please
accept
a
parting
gift
now
one
basket
was
very
heavy
and
the
other
very
light
the
old
man
not
being
greedy
said
he
would
take
the
lighter
one
so
with
many
thanks
and
bows
and
he
set
off
homewards
he
reached
his
hut
safely
but
instead
of
a
kind
welcome
the
old
hag
began
to
scold
him
for
being
away
so
long
he
begged
her
to
be
quiet
and
telling
of
his
visit
to
the
sparrows
opened
the
basket
while
the
scowling
old
woman
held
her
tongue
out
of
sheer
curiosity
oh
what
a
splendid
sight
there
were
gold
and
silver
coin
and
gems
and
coral
and
crystal
and
amber
and
the
bag
of
money
and
the
invisible
coat
and
hat
and
rolls
of
books
and
all
manner
of
precious
things
at
the
sight
of
so
much
wealth
the
old
hag
scowl
changed
to
a
smile
of
greedy
joy
i
go
right
off
and
get
a
present
from
the
sparrows
said
she
so
binding
on
her
straw
sandals
and
tucking
up
her
skirts
and
adjusting
her
girdle
tying
the
bow
in
front
she
seized
her
staff
and
set
off
on
the
road
arriving
at
the
sparrow
house
she
began
to
flatter
sparrow
by
soft
speeches
of
course
the
polite
sparrow
invited
her
into
his
house
but
nothing
but
a
cup
of
tea
was
offered
her
and
wife
and
daughters
kept
away
seeing
she
was
not
going
to
get
any
gift
the
brazen
hussy
asked
for
one
the
sparrow
then
brought
out
and
set
before
her
two
baskets
one
heavy
and
the
other
light
taking
the
heavier
one
without
so
much
as
saying
thank
you
she
carried
it
back
with
her
then
she
opened
it
expecting
all
kinds
of
riches
she
took
off
the
lid
when
a
horrible
rushed
at
her
and
a
horned
snapped
his
tusks
at
her
a
skeleton
poked
his
bony
fingers
in
her
face
and
finally
a
long
hairy
serpent
with
a
big
head
and
lolling
tongue
sprang
out
and
coiled
around
her
cracking
her
bones
and
squeezing
out
her
breath
till
she
died
after
the
good
old
man
had
buried
his
wife
he
adopted
a
son
to
comfort
his
old
age
and
with
his
treasures
lived
at
ease
all
his
days
the
lovers
in
japan
the
emit
so
brilliant
a
light
and
are
so
beautiful
that
ladies
go
out
in
the
evenings
and
catch
the
insects
for
amusement
as
may
be
seen
represented
on
japanese
fans
they
imprison
them
in
tiny
cages
made
of
bamboo
threads
and
hang
them
up
in
their
rooms
or
suspend
them
from
the
eaves
of
their
houses
at
their
picnic
parties
the
people
love
to
sit
on
august
evenings
fan
in
hand
looking
over
the
lovely
landscape
spangled
by
ten
thousand
brilliant
spots
of
golden
light
each
flash
seems
like
a
tiny
blaze
of
harmless
lightning
one
of
the
species
of
the
most
beautiful
of
all
is
a
source
of
much
amusement
to
the
ladies
hanging
the
cage
of
glittering
insects
on
their
verandahs
they
sit
and
watch
the
crowd
of
winged
visitors
attracted
by
the
light
what
brings
them
there
and
why
the
parlor
is
filled
with
suitors
as
a
queen
court
with
courtiers
let
this
love
story
tell
on
the
southern
and
sunny
side
of
the
castle
moats
of
the
fukui
castle
in
echizen
the
water
had
long
ago
become
shallow
so
that
lotus
lilies
grew
luxuriantly
deep
in
the
heart
of
one
of
the
great
flowers
whose
petals
were
as
pink
as
the
lining
of
a
lived
the
king
of
the
whose
only
daughter
was
the
lovely
princess
while
still
a
child
the
himé
princess
was
carefully
kept
at
home
within
the
pink
petals
of
the
lily
never
going
even
to
the
edges
except
to
see
her
father
fly
off
on
his
journey
dutifully
she
waited
until
of
age
when
the
fire
glowed
in
her
own
body
and
shone
beautifully
illuminating
the
lotus
until
its
light
at
night
was
like
a
lamp
within
a
globe
of
coral
every
night
her
light
grew
brighter
and
brighter
until
at
last
it
was
as
mellow
as
gold
then
her
father
said
my
daughter
is
now
of
age
she
may
fly
abroad
with
me
sometimes
and
when
the
proper
suitor
comes
she
may
marry
whom
she
will
so
flew
forth
in
and
out
among
the
lotus
lilies
of
the
moat
then
into
rich
rice
fields
and
at
last
far
off
to
the
indigo
meadows
whenever
she
went
a
crowd
of
suitors
followed
her
for
she
had
the
singular
power
of
attracting
all
the
insects
to
herself
but
she
cared
for
none
of
their
attentions
and
though
she
spoke
politely
to
them
all
she
gave
encouragement
to
none
yet
some
of
the
gallants
called
her
a
coquette
one
night
she
said
to
her
mother
the
queen
i
have
met
many
admirers
but
i
do
wish
a
husband
from
any
of
them
tonight
i
shall
stay
at
home
and
if
any
of
them
love
me
truly
they
will
come
and
pay
me
court
here
then
i
shall
lay
an
impossible
duty
on
them
if
they
are
wise
they
will
not
try
to
perform
it
and
if
they
love
their
lives
more
than
they
love
me
i
do
not
want
any
of
them
whoever
succeeds
may
have
me
for
his
bride
as
you
will
my
child
said
the
queen
mother
who
arrayed
her
daughter
in
her
most
resplendent
robes
and
set
her
on
her
throne
in
the
heart
of
the
lotus
then
she
gave
orders
to
her
to
keep
all
suitors
at
a
respectful
distance
lest
some
stupid
gallant
a
or
a
cockchafer
dazzled
by
the
light
should
approach
too
near
and
hurt
the
princess
or
shake
her
throne
no
sooner
had
twilight
faded
away
than
forth
came
the
golden
beetle
who
stood
on
a
stamen
and
making
obeisance
said
i
am
lord
i
offer
my
house
my
fortune
and
my
love
to
princess
hotaru
go
and
bring
me
fire
and
i
will
be
your
bride
said
with
a
bow
of
the
head
the
beetle
opened
his
wings
and
departed
with
a
stately
whirr
next
came
a
shining
bug
with
wings
and
body
as
black
as
who
solemnly
professed
his
passion
bring
me
fire
and
you
may
have
me
for
your
wife
off
flew
the
bug
with
a
buzz
pretty
soon
came
the
scarlet
expecting
so
to
dazzle
the
princess
by
his
gorgeous
colors
that
she
would
accept
him
at
once
i
decline
your
offer
said
the
princess
but
if
you
bring
me
a
flash
of
fire
i
become
your
bride
swift
was
the
flight
of
the
on
his
errand
and
in
came
the
beetle
with
a
tremendous
buzz
and
ardently
plead
his
suit
i
say
if
you
bring
me
fire
said
the
glittering
princess
suitor
after
suitor
appeared
to
woo
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
the
until
every
petal
was
dotted
with
them
one
after
another
in
a
long
troop
they
appeared
each
in
his
own
way
proudly
humbly
boldly
mildly
with
flattery
with
boasting
even
with
tears
each
proffered
his
love
told
his
rank
or
expatiated
on
his
fortune
or
vowed
his
constancy
sang
his
tune
or
played
his
music
to
every
one
of
her
lovers
the
princess
in
modest
voice
returned
the
same
answer
bring
me
fire
and
i
be
your
bride
so
without
telling
his
rivals
each
one
thinking
he
had
the
secret
alone
sped
away
after
fire
but
none
ever
came
back
to
wed
the
princess
alas
for
the
poor
suitors
the
beetle
whizzed
off
to
a
house
near
by
through
the
paper
windows
of
which
light
glimmered
so
full
was
he
of
his
passion
that
thinking
nothing
of
wood
or
iron
he
dashed
his
head
against
a
nail
and
fell
dead
on
the
ground
the
black
bug
flew
into
a
room
where
a
poor
student
was
reading
his
lamp
was
only
a
dish
of
earthenware
full
of
rape
seed
oil
with
a
wick
made
of
pith
knowing
nothing
of
oil
the
bug
crawled
into
the
dish
to
reach
the
flame
and
in
a
few
seconds
was
drowned
in
the
oil
nan
jaro
what
that
said
a
thrifty
housewife
sitting
with
needle
in
hand
as
her
lamp
flared
up
for
a
moment
smoking
the
chimney
and
then
cracking
it
while
picking
out
the
scorched
bits
she
found
a
roasted
whose
scarlet
wings
were
all
burned
off
mad
with
love
the
brilliant
afraid
of
the
flame
yet
determined
to
win
the
fire
for
the
princess
hovered
round
and
round
the
candle
flame
coming
nearer
and
nearer
each
time
now
or
never
the
princess
or
death
he
buzzed
as
he
darted
forward
to
snatch
a
flash
of
flame
but
singeing
his
wings
he
fell
helplessly
down
and
died
in
agony
what
a
fool
he
was
to
be
sure
said
the
ugly
clothes
moth
coming
on
the
spot
i
get
the
fire
i
crawl
up
the
candle
so
he
climbed
up
the
hollow
paper
wick
and
was
nearly
to
the
top
and
inside
the
hollow
blue
part
of
the
flame
when
the
man
snuffing
the
wick
crushed
him
to
death
sad
indeed
was
the
fate
of
the
lovers
of
daughter
some
hovered
around
the
beacons
on
the
headland
some
fluttered
about
the
great
wax
candles
which
stood
eight
feet
high
in
their
brass
sockets
in
buddhist
temples
some
burned
their
noses
at
the
top
of
incense
sticks
or
were
nearly
choked
by
the
smoke
some
danced
all
night
around
the
lanterns
in
the
shrines
some
sought
the
sepulchral
lamps
in
the
graveyard
one
visited
the
cremation
furnace
another
the
kitchen
where
a
feast
was
going
on
another
chased
the
sparks
that
flew
out
of
the
chimney
but
none
brought
fire
to
the
princess
or
won
the
lover
prize
many
lost
their
feelers
had
their
shining
bodies
scorched
or
their
wings
singed
but
most
of
them
alas
lay
dead
black
and
cold
next
morning
as
the
priests
trimmed
the
lamps
in
the
shrines
and
the
servant
maids
the
lanterns
each
said
alike
the
princess
hotaru
must
have
had
many
lovers
last
night
alas
alas
poor
suitors
some
tried
to
snatch
a
streak
of
green
fire
from
the
cat
eyes
and
were
snapped
up
for
their
pains
one
attempted
to
get
a
mouthful
of
bird
breath
but
was
swallowed
alive
a
carrion
beetle
the
ugly
lover
crawled
off
to
the
sea
shore
and
found
some
fish
scales
that
emitted
light
the
climbed
a
mountain
and
in
a
rotten
tree
stump
found
some
bits
of
glowing
wood
like
fire
but
the
distance
was
so
great
that
long
before
they
reached
the
castle
moat
it
was
daylight
and
the
fire
had
gone
out
so
they
threw
their
fish
scales
and
old
wood
away
the
next
day
was
one
of
great
mourning
and
there
were
so
many
funerals
going
on
that
the
prince
of
the
on
the
north
side
of
the
castle
moat
inquired
of
his
servants
the
cause
then
he
learned
for
the
first
time
of
the
glittering
princess
upon
this
the
prince
who
had
just
succeeded
his
father
upon
the
throne
fell
in
love
with
the
princess
and
resolved
to
marry
her
he
sent
his
chamberlain
to
ask
of
her
father
his
daughter
in
marriage
according
to
true
etiquette
the
father
agreed
to
the
prince
proposal
with
the
condition
that
the
prince
should
obey
her
behest
in
one
thing
which
was
to
come
in
person
bringing
her
fire
then
the
prince
at
the
head
of
his
glittering
battalions
came
in
person
and
filled
the
lotus
palace
with
a
flood
of
golden
light
but
was
so
beautiful
that
her
charms
paled
not
their
fire
even
in
the
blaze
of
the
prince
glory
the
visit
ended
in
wooing
and
the
wooing
in
wedding
on
the
night
appointed
in
a
palanquin
made
of
the
white
amid
the
blazing
torches
of
the
prince
battalions
of
warriors
was
borne
to
the
prince
palace
and
there
prince
and
princess
were
joined
in
the
wedlock
many
generations
have
passed
since
and
were
married
and
still
it
is
the
whim
of
all
princesses
that
their
lovers
must
bring
fire
as
their
or
lose
their
prize
else
would
the
glittering
fair
ones
be
wearied
unto
death
by
the
importunity
of
their
lovers
great
indeed
is
the
loss
for
in
this
quest
of
fire
many
thousand
insects
attracted
by
the
are
burned
to
death
in
the
vain
hope
of
winning
the
fire
that
shall
gain
the
cruel
but
beautiful
one
that
fascinates
them
it
is
for
this
cause
that
each
night
insects
hover
around
the
lamp
flame
and
every
morning
a
crowd
of
victims
drowned
in
the
oil
or
scorched
in
the
flame
must
be
cleaned
from
the
lamp
this
is
the
reason
why
young
ladies
catch
and
imprison
the
to
watch
the
war
of
in
the
hope
that
they
may
have
human
lovers
who
will
dare
as
much
through
fire
and
flood
as
they
the
battle
of
the
ape
and
the
crab
in
the
land
where
neither
the
monkeys
or
the
cats
have
tails
and
the
persimmons
grow
to
be
as
large
as
apples
and
with
seeds
bigger
than
a
melon
there
once
lived
a
land
crab
in
the
side
of
a
sand
hill
one
day
an
ape
came
along
having
a
persimmon
seed
which
he
offered
to
swap
with
the
crab
for
a
the
crab
agreed
and
planting
the
seed
in
his
garden
went
out
every
day
to
watch
it
grow
the
ape
came
to
visit
the
crab
and
seeing
the
fine
tree
laden
with
the
fruit
begged
a
few
the
crab
asking
pardon
of
the
ape
said
he
could
not
climb
the
tree
to
offer
him
any
but
agreed
to
give
the
ape
half
if
he
would
mount
the
tree
and
pluck
them
so
the
monkey
ran
up
the
tree
while
the
crab
waited
below
expecting
to
eat
the
ripe
fruit
but
the
monkey
sitting
on
a
limb
first
filled
his
pockets
full
and
then
picking
off
all
the
best
ones
greedily
ate
the
pulp
and
threw
the
skin
and
stones
in
the
crab
face
every
once
in
a
while
he
would
pull
off
a
green
sour
persimmon
and
hit
the
crab
hard
until
his
shell
was
nearly
cracked
at
last
the
crab
thought
he
would
get
the
best
of
the
ape
so
when
his
enemy
had
eaten
his
fill
until
he
was
bulged
out
he
cried
out
now
mister
ape
i
dare
you
to
come
down
you
ca
do
it
so
the
ape
began
to
descend
head
downward
this
was
just
what
the
crab
wanted
for
all
the
finest
persimmons
rolled
out
of
his
pockets
on
the
ground
the
crab
quickly
gathered
them
up
and
with
both
arms
full
ran
off
to
his
hole
then
the
ape
was
very
angry
he
kindled
a
fire
and
blew
the
smoke
down
the
hole
until
the
crab
was
nearly
choked
the
poor
crab
to
save
his
life
had
to
crawl
out
then
the
monkey
beat
him
soundly
and
left
him
for
dead
the
crab
had
not
been
long
thus
when
three
travelers
a
an
egg
and
a
wasp
found
him
lying
on
the
ground
they
carried
him
into
the
house
bound
up
his
wounds
and
while
he
lay
in
bed
they
planned
how
they
might
destroy
the
ape
they
all
talked
of
the
matter
over
their
cups
of
tea
and
after
the
mortar
had
smoked
several
pipes
of
tobacco
a
plan
was
agreed
on
so
taking
the
crab
along
stiff
and
sore
as
he
was
they
marched
to
the
monkey
castle
the
wasp
flew
inside
and
found
that
their
enemy
was
away
from
home
then
all
entered
and
hid
themselves
the
egg
cuddled
up
under
the
ashes
in
the
hearth
the
wasp
flew
into
the
closet
the
mortar
hid
behind
the
door
they
then
waited
for
the
ape
to
come
home
the
crab
sat
beside
the
fire
towards
evening
the
monkey
arrived
and
throwing
off
his
coat
which
was
just
what
the
wasp
wanted
he
lighted
a
sulphur
match
and
kindling
a
fire
hung
on
the
kettle
for
a
cup
of
tea
and
pulled
out
his
pipe
for
a
smoke
just
as
he
sat
down
by
the
hearth
to
salute
the
crab
the
egg
burst
and
the
hot
yolk
flew
all
over
him
and
in
his
eye
nearly
blinding
him
he
rushed
out
to
the
to
plunge
in
the
tub
of
cold
water
when
the
wasp
flew
at
him
and
stung
his
nose
slipping
down
he
fell
flat
on
the
floor
when
the
mortar
rolled
on
him
and
crushed
him
to
death
then
the
whole
party
congratulated
the
crab
on
their
victory
grateful
for
the
friendship
thus
shown
the
whole
party
crab
mortar
and
wasp
lived
in
peace
together
the
crab
married
the
daughter
of
a
rich
crab
that
lived
over
the
hill
and
a
great
feast
of
persimmons
was
spread
before
the
bride
relatives
who
came
to
see
the
ceremony
a
little
crab
was
born
which
became
a
great
pet
with
the
mortar
and
wasp
with
no
more
apes
to
plague
them
they
lived
very
happily
illustration
the
egg
wasp
and
mortar
attack
the
monkey
the
wonderful
a
long
time
ago
there
was
an
old
priest
who
lived
in
the
temple
of
morinji
in
the
province
of
hitachi
he
cooked
his
own
rice
boiled
his
own
tea
swept
his
own
floor
and
lived
frugally
as
an
honest
priest
should
do
one
day
he
was
sitting
near
the
square
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
a
rope
and
chain
to
hold
the
pot
and
kettle
hung
down
from
the
covered
hole
in
the
ceiling
which
did
duty
as
a
chimney
a
pair
of
brass
tongs
was
stuck
in
the
ashes
and
the
fire
blazed
merrily
at
the
side
of
the
on
the
floor
was
a
tray
filled
with
tiny
a
pewter
a
bamboo
and
a
little
dipper
the
priest
having
finished
sweeping
the
ashes
off
the
edges
of
the
hearth
with
a
little
whisk
of
hawk
feathers
was
just
about
to
put
on
the
tea
when
suzz
suzz
sang
the
spout
and
then
pattari
pattari
said
the
lid
as
it
flapped
up
and
down
and
the
kettle
swung
backwards
and
forwards
what
does
this
mean
said
the
old
bonze
said
he
with
a
start
as
the
spout
of
the
kettle
turned
into
a
badger
nose
with
its
big
whiskers
while
from
the
other
side
sprouted
out
a
long
bushy
tail
shouted
the
priest
dropping
the
and
spilling
the
green
tea
all
over
the
matting
as
four
hairy
legs
appeared
under
the
kettle
and
the
strange
compound
half
badger
and
half
kettle
jumped
off
the
fire
and
began
running
around
the
room
to
the
horror
it
leaped
on
a
shelf
puffed
out
its
belly
and
began
to
beat
a
tune
with
its
as
if
it
were
a
drum
the
old
bonze
pupils
hearing
the
racket
rushed
in
and
after
a
lively
chase
upsetting
piles
of
books
and
breaking
some
of
the
secured
the
badger
and
squeezed
him
in
a
keg
used
for
storing
the
pickled
radishes
called
or
japanese
they
fastened
down
the
lid
with
a
heavy
stone
they
were
sure
that
the
strong
odor
of
the
radishes
would
kill
the
beast
for
no
man
could
possibly
survive
such
a
smell
and
it
was
not
likely
a
badger
could
the
next
morning
the
tinker
of
the
village
called
in
and
the
priest
told
him
about
his
strange
visitor
wishing
to
show
him
the
animal
he
cautiously
lifted
the
lid
of
the
cask
lest
the
badger
might
after
all
be
still
alive
in
spite
of
the
stench
of
the
sour
mess
when
lo
there
was
nothing
but
the
old
iron
fearing
that
the
utensil
might
play
the
same
prank
again
the
priest
was
glad
to
sell
it
to
the
tinker
who
bought
the
kettle
for
a
few
iron
cash
he
carried
it
to
his
junk
shop
though
he
thought
it
felt
unusually
heavy
the
tinker
went
to
bed
as
usual
that
night
with
his
or
paper
shaded
lamp
just
back
of
his
head
about
midnight
hearing
a
strange
noise
like
the
flapping
up
and
down
of
an
iron
he
sat
up
in
bed
rubbed
his
eyes
and
there
was
the
iron
pot
covered
with
fur
and
sprouting
out
legs
in
short
it
was
turning
into
a
hairy
beast
going
over
to
the
recess
and
taking
a
fan
from
the
rack
the
badger
climbed
up
on
the
frame
of
the
lamp
and
began
to
dance
on
its
one
hind
leg
waving
the
fan
with
its
it
played
many
other
tricks
until
the
man
started
up
and
then
the
badger
turned
into
a
again
i
declare
said
the
tinker
as
he
woke
up
next
morning
and
talked
the
matter
over
with
his
wife
i
just
a
mountain
earn
my
fortune
on
this
kettle
it
certainly
is
a
very
highly
accomplished
i
call
it
the
bumbuku
chagama
the
accomplished
in
literature
and
military
art
and
exhibit
it
to
the
public
so
the
tinker
hired
a
professional
for
his
business
agent
and
built
a
little
theatre
and
stage
then
he
gave
an
order
to
a
friend
of
his
an
artist
to
paint
scenery
with
fuji
yama
and
cranes
flying
in
the
air
and
a
crimson
sun
shining
through
the
bamboo
and
a
red
moon
rising
over
the
waves
and
golden
clouds
and
tortoises
and
the
sumiyoshi
couple
and
the
grasshopper
picnic
and
the
procession
of
lord
and
such
like
then
he
stretched
a
tight
rope
of
across
the
stage
and
the
handbills
being
stuck
up
in
all
the
barber
shops
in
town
and
wooden
tickets
branded
with
accomplished
and
lucky
performance
admit
one
the
show
was
opened
the
house
was
full
and
the
people
came
in
parties
bringing
their
full
of
tea
and
picnic
boxes
full
of
rice
and
eggs
and
dumplings
made
of
millet
meal
sugared
cakes
and
other
refreshments
because
they
came
to
stay
all
day
mothers
brought
their
babies
with
them
for
the
children
enjoyed
it
most
of
all
then
the
tinker
dressed
up
in
his
wide
ceremonial
clothes
with
a
big
fan
in
his
hand
came
out
on
the
platform
made
his
bow
and
set
the
wonderful
on
the
stage
then
at
a
wave
of
his
fan
the
kettle
ran
around
on
four
legs
half
badger
and
half
iron
clanking
its
lid
and
wagging
its
tail
next
it
turned
into
a
badger
swelled
out
its
body
and
beat
a
tune
on
it
like
a
drum
it
danced
a
jig
on
the
tight
rope
and
walked
the
slack
rope
holding
a
fan
or
an
umbrella
in
his
paw
stood
on
his
head
and
finally
at
a
flourish
of
his
master
fan
became
a
cold
and
rusty
again
the
audience
were
wild
with
delight
and
as
the
fame
of
the
wonderful
spread
many
people
came
from
great
distances
year
after
year
the
tinker
exhibited
the
wonder
until
he
grew
immensely
rich
then
he
retired
from
the
show
business
and
out
of
gratitude
took
the
old
kettle
to
the
temple
again
and
deposited
it
there
as
a
precious
relic
it
was
then
named
bumbuku
dai
mio
jin
the
great
illustrious
accomplished
in
literature
and
the
military
art
and
the
treasure
island
very
long
long
ago
there
lived
an
old
man
and
woman
in
a
village
near
a
mountain
from
which
flowed
a
stream
of
purest
water
this
old
couple
loved
each
other
so
dearly
and
lived
together
so
happily
that
the
neighbors
called
them
a
couple
after
the
mandarin
ducks
which
always
dwell
together
in
pairs
and
are
so
affectionate
that
they
are
said
to
pine
and
die
if
one
be
taken
from
the
other
the
old
man
was
a
woodcutter
and
the
old
woman
kept
house
but
they
were
very
lonely
for
they
had
no
child
and
often
grieved
over
their
hard
lot
one
day
while
the
man
was
out
on
the
mountain
cutting
brush
his
old
crone
took
her
shallow
tub
and
clothes
down
to
the
brook
to
she
had
not
yet
begun
when
she
saw
a
peach
floating
with
its
stem
and
two
leaves
in
the
stream
she
picked
up
the
fruit
and
set
it
aside
to
take
home
and
share
it
with
her
old
man
when
he
returned
she
set
it
before
him
not
dreaming
what
was
in
it
he
was
just
about
to
cut
it
open
when
the
peach
fell
in
half
and
there
lay
a
little
baby
boy
the
happy
old
couple
rejoiced
over
him
and
reared
him
tenderly
because
he
was
their
first
child
taro
and
born
of
a
peach
momo
they
called
him
momotarō
or
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
the
child
was
his
great
strength
even
when
still
a
baby
he
would
astonish
his
by
standing
on
the
mats
and
lifting
her
wash
tub
or
kettle
of
hot
tea
which
he
would
balance
above
his
head
without
spilling
a
drop
the
little
fellow
grew
to
be
strong
and
brave
and
good
he
was
always
kind
to
his
parents
and
saved
them
many
a
step
and
much
toil
he
practiced
archery
wrestling
and
handling
the
iron
club
until
he
was
not
afraid
of
anybody
or
anything
he
even
laughed
at
the
oni
who
were
demons
living
in
the
clouds
or
on
lonely
islands
in
the
sea
momotarō
was
also
very
kind
to
birds
and
animals
so
that
they
were
very
tame
and
became
his
friends
knew
him
and
called
him
by
name
now
there
was
an
island
far
out
in
the
ocean
inhabited
by
onis
with
horns
in
their
heads
and
big
sharp
tusks
in
their
mouths
who
ravaged
the
shores
of
japan
and
ate
up
the
people
in
the
centre
of
the
island
was
the
giant
oni
castle
built
inside
a
great
cave
which
was
full
of
all
kinds
of
treasures
such
as
every
one
wants
these
are
the
hat
which
makes
the
one
who
puts
it
on
invisible
it
looks
just
like
a
straw
hat
but
has
a
tuft
of
fine
grass
on
the
top
and
a
pink
fringe
like
the
lining
of
shells
around
the
brim
a
coat
like
a
farmer
grass
which
makes
the
wearer
invisible
the
crystal
jewels
which
flash
fire
and
govern
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide
shippō
or
the
seven
jewels
namely
gold
and
silver
branch
of
red
coral
agate
emerald
crystal
and
pearl
all
together
called
or
precious
treasures
momotaro
made
up
his
mind
to
conquer
these
demons
and
get
their
treasures
he
prepared
his
weapons
and
asked
the
old
woman
to
make
him
some
millet
dumplings
so
the
old
lady
ground
the
millet
seeds
into
meal
the
old
man
kneaded
the
dough
and
both
made
the
dumplings
which
the
little
hero
carefully
stuck
on
skewers
and
stowed
away
in
a
bamboo
this
he
wrapped
in
a
silk
napkin
and
flung
it
over
his
shoulder
seizing
his
iron
club
he
stuck
his
flag
in
his
back
as
the
sign
of
war
the
flag
was
of
white
silk
crossed
by
two
black
bars
at
the
top
and
underneath
these
was
embroidered
the
device
of
a
peach
with
a
stem
and
two
leaves
floating
on
a
running
stream
this
was
his
crest
or
banneret
then
he
bade
the
old
folks
and
walked
off
briskly
he
took
his
little
dog
with
him
giving
him
a
millet
dumpling
now
and
then
as
he
passed
along
he
met
a
monkey
chattering
and
showing
his
teeth
the
monkey
said
where
are
you
going
mr
i
going
to
the
island
to
get
his
treasures
what
have
you
got
good
in
your
package
millet
dumplings
have
one
yes
give
me
one
and
i
go
with
you
said
the
monkey
so
the
monkey
ate
the
dumpling
and
boy
dog
and
monkey
all
trudged
on
together
a
little
further
on
a
pheasant
met
them
and
said
ohio
momotarō
doko
good
morning
where
are
you
going
told
him
and
at
the
same
time
offered
him
a
dumpling
this
made
the
pheasant
his
friend
and
his
little
army
of
three
retainers
journeyed
on
until
they
reached
the
there
they
found
a
big
boat
into
which
with
the
dog
and
monkey
embarked
while
the
pheasant
flew
over
to
the
island
to
find
a
safe
place
to
land
so
as
to
take
the
onis
by
surprise
they
quietly
reached
the
door
of
the
cave
and
then
momotarō
beat
in
the
gate
with
his
iron
club
rushing
into
the
castle
he
put
the
small
onis
to
flight
and
dashing
forward
the
little
hero
would
nearly
have
reached
the
room
where
the
giant
oni
was
just
waking
up
after
a
drunkenness
with
a
terrible
roar
he
advanced
to
gobble
up
when
the
dog
ran
behind
and
bit
the
oni
in
the
leg
the
monkey
climbed
up
his
back
and
blinded
him
with
his
paws
while
the
pheasant
flew
in
his
face
then
beat
him
with
his
iron
club
until
he
begged
for
his
life
and
promised
to
give
up
all
his
treasures
the
onis
brought
all
their
precious
things
out
of
the
storehouse
and
laid
them
on
great
tables
or
trays
before
the
little
hero
and
his
little
army
momotaro
sat
on
a
rock
with
his
little
army
of
three
retainers
around
him
holding
his
fan
with
his
hands
akimbo
on
his
knees
just
as
mighty
generals
do
after
a
battle
when
they
receive
the
submission
of
their
enemies
on
his
right
sat
kneeling
on
the
ground
his
faithful
monkey
while
the
pheasant
and
dog
sat
on
the
left
after
the
onis
had
surrendered
all
they
fell
down
on
their
hands
and
knees
with
their
faces
in
the
dust
and
acknowledged
as
their
master
and
swore
they
would
ever
henceforth
be
his
slaves
then
with
a
wave
of
his
fan
bade
them
rise
up
and
carry
the
treasures
to
the
largest
ship
they
had
and
to
point
the
prow
to
the
land
this
done
momotaro
and
his
company
got
on
board
and
the
onis
bowed
farewell
a
stiff
breeze
sprang
up
and
sent
the
ship
plowing
through
the
waters
and
bent
out
the
great
white
sail
like
a
bow
on
the
prow
was
a
long
black
tassel
like
the
mane
of
a
horse
that
at
every
lurch
dipped
in
the
waves
and
as
it
rose
flung
off
the
spray
the
old
couple
becoming
anxious
after
their
had
traveled
down
to
the
sea
shore
and
arrived
just
as
the
treasure
ship
hove
in
sight
oh
how
beautiful
it
looked
with
its
branches
of
red
coral
and
shining
heaps
of
gold
and
silver
and
the
invisible
coat
and
hat
the
dazzling
sheen
of
the
jewels
of
the
ebbing
and
the
flowing
tide
the
glistening
pearls
and
piles
of
agate
and
crystal
illustration
the
oni
submitting
to
peach
prince
momotaro
came
home
laden
with
riches
enough
to
keep
the
old
couple
in
comfort
all
their
lives
and
he
himself
lived
in
great
state
he
knighted
the
monkey
the
dog
and
the
pheasant
and
made
them
his
then
he
married
a
beautiful
princess
and
lived
happily
till
he
died
the
fox
and
the
badger
there
is
a
certain
mountainous
district
in
shikoku
in
which
a
skillful
hunter
had
trapped
or
shot
so
many
foxes
and
badgers
that
only
a
few
were
left
these
were
an
old
grey
badger
and
a
female
fox
with
one
cub
though
hard
pressed
by
hunger
neither
dared
to
touch
a
loose
piece
of
food
lest
a
trap
might
be
hidden
under
it
indeed
they
scarcely
stirred
out
of
their
holes
except
at
night
lest
the
hunter
arrow
should
strike
them
at
last
the
two
animals
held
a
council
together
to
decide
what
to
do
whether
to
emigrate
or
to
attempt
to
outwit
their
enemy
they
thought
a
long
while
when
finally
the
badger
having
hit
upon
a
good
plan
cried
out
i
have
it
do
you
transform
yourself
into
a
man
i
pretend
to
be
dead
then
you
can
bind
me
up
and
sell
me
in
the
town
with
the
money
paid
you
can
buy
some
food
then
i
get
loose
and
come
back
the
next
week
i
sell
you
and
you
can
escape
ha
ha
ha
good
good
cried
both
together
it
a
capital
plan
said
fox
so
the
fox
changed
herself
into
a
human
form
and
the
badger
pretending
to
be
dead
was
tied
up
with
straw
ropes
slinging
him
over
her
shoulder
the
fox
went
to
town
sold
the
badger
and
buying
a
lot
of
and
one
or
two
chickens
made
a
feast
by
this
time
the
badger
had
got
loose
for
the
man
to
whom
he
was
sold
thinking
him
dead
had
not
watched
him
carefully
so
scampering
away
to
the
mountains
he
met
the
fox
who
congratulated
him
while
both
feasted
merrily
the
next
week
the
badger
took
human
form
and
going
to
town
sold
the
fox
who
made
believe
to
be
dead
but
the
badger
being
an
old
and
very
greedy
wanted
all
the
money
and
food
for
himself
so
he
whispered
in
the
man
ear
to
watch
the
fox
well
as
she
was
only
feigning
to
be
dead
so
the
man
taking
up
a
club
gave
the
fox
a
blow
on
the
head
which
finished
her
the
badger
buying
a
good
dinner
ate
it
all
himself
and
licked
his
chops
never
even
thinking
of
the
fox
cub
the
cub
after
waiting
a
long
time
for
its
mother
to
come
back
suspected
foul
play
and
resolved
on
revenge
so
going
to
the
badger
he
challenged
him
to
a
trial
of
skill
in
the
art
of
transformation
the
badger
accepted
right
off
for
he
despised
the
cub
and
wished
to
be
rid
of
him
well
what
do
you
want
to
do
first
said
sir
badger
i
propose
that
you
go
and
stand
on
the
big
bridge
leading
to
the
city
said
the
cub
and
wait
for
my
appearance
i
shall
come
in
splendid
garments
and
with
many
followers
in
my
train
if
you
recognize
me
you
win
and
i
lose
if
you
fail
i
win
so
the
badger
went
and
waited
behind
a
tree
soon
a
daimio
riding
in
a
palanquin
with
a
splendid
retinue
of
courtiers
appeared
coming
up
the
road
thinking
this
was
the
changed
into
a
nobleman
although
wondering
at
the
skill
of
the
young

contentment
talents

and
love
their
images
carved
in

or

and

picture
of
the
laden
with
shippō
the
seven
jewels
and
all
the
good
things
of
life
which
men
most
desire
is
hung
up
in
houses
the
ship
is
coming
into
port
and
the
passengers
are
the
seven
happy
fairies
who
will
make
gifts
to
the
people
these
seven
jewels
are
the
same
as
those
which
momotaro
brought
back
from
the
oni
island
first
there
is
fukoruku
jin
the
patron
of
long
life
or
length
of
days
he
has
an
enormously
high
forehead
rounded
at
the
top
which
makes
his
head
look
like
a
it
is
bald
and
shiny
a
few
stray
white
hairs
sometimes
sprout
up
and
the
barber
to
reach
them
has
to
prop
a
ladder
against
his
head
to
climb
up
and
apply
his
razor
this
big
head
comes
from
thinking
so
much
his
eyebrows
are
and
a
long
snowy
beard
falls
down
over
his
breast
once
in
a
while
in
a
good
humor
he
ties
a
handkerchief
over
his
high
slippery
crown
and
allows
little
boys
to
climb
up
on
top
that
is
if
they
are
good
and
can
write
well
when
he
wants
to
show
how
strong
and
lively
he
is
even
though
so
old
he
lets
daikoku
the
fat
fellow
ride
on
top
of
his
head
while
he
smokes
his
pipe
and
wades
across
a
river
daikoku
has
to
hold
on
tightly
or
he
will
slip
down
and
get
a
ducking
usually
the
old
shiny
head
is
a
very
solemn
gentleman
and
walks
slowly
along
with
his
staff
in
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
strokes
his
long
eyebrows
the
tortoise
and
the
crane
are
always
with
him
for
these
are
his
pets
sometimes
a
stag
with
hair
white
with
age
walks
behind
him
every
body
likes
fukoruku
jin
because
every
one
wants
to
get
his
favor
and
live
long
until
like
a
lobster
their
backs
are
bent
with
age
at
a
wedding
you
will
always
see
a
picture
of
and
fukoruku
jin
daikoku
is
a
short
chubby
fellow
with
eyes
half
sunk
in
fat
but
twinkling
with
fun
he
has
a
flat
cap
set
on
his
head
like
the
kind
which
babies
wear
a
loose
sack
over
his
shoulders
and
big
boots
on
his
feet
his
throne
is
two
straw
bags
of
rice
and
his
badge
of
office
is
a
mallet
or
hammer
which
makes
people
rich
when
he
shakes
it
the
hammer
is
the
symbol
of
labor
showing
that
people
may
expect
to
get
rich
only
by
hard
work
one
end
of
it
is
carved
to
represent
the
jewel
of
the
ebbing
and
the
flowing
tides
because
merchants
get
rich
by
commerce
on
the
sea
and
must
watch
the
tides
he
is
often
seen
holding
the
arithmetic
frame
on
which
you
can
count
do
sums
subtract
multiply
or
divide
by
sliding
balls
up
and
down
a
row
of
sticks
set
in
a
frame
instead
of
writing
figures
beside
him
is
a
ledger
and
his
favorite
animal
is
the
rat
which
like
some
rich
men
pets
eats
or
runs
away
with
his
wealth
the
great
radish
called
daikon
two
feet
long
and
as
big
as
a
man
calf
is
always
seen
near
him
because
it
signifies
flourishing
prosperity
he
keeps
his
bag
tightly
shut
for
money
easily
runs
away
when
the
purse
is
once
opened
he
never
lets
go
his
hammer
for
it
is
only
by
constant
care
that
any
one
can
keep
money
after
he
gets
it
even
when
he
frolics
with
fukuroku
jin
and
rides
on
his
head
he
keeps
his
hammer
ready
swinging
at
his
belt
he
has
huge
lop
ears
once
in
a
while
when
he
wishes
to
take
exercise
and
fukuroku
jin
wants
to
show
how
frisky
he
can
be
even
if
he
is
old
they
have
a
wrestling
match
together
daikoku
nearly
always
beats
because
fukuroku
jin
is
so
tall
that
he
has
to
bend
down
to
grip
daikoku
who
is
fat
and
short
and
thus
he
becomes
then
daikoku
gets
his
rival
long
head
under
his
left
arm
seizes
him
over
his
back
by
the
belt
and
throws
him
over
his
shoulder
flat
on
the
ground
but
if
fukuroku
jin
can
only
get
hold
of
daikoku
lop
ears
both
fall
together
then
they
laugh
heartily
and
try
it
again
ebisu
is
the
patron
of
daily
food
which
is
rice
and
fish
and
in
old
times
was
chiefly
fish
he
is
nearly
as
fat
as
daikoku
but
wears
a
court
noble
high
cap
he
is
always
fishing
or
enjoying
his
game
when
very
happy
he
sits
on
a
rock
by
the
sea
with
his
right
leg
bent
under
him
and
a
big
red
fish
called
the
tai
under
his
left
arm
he
carries
a
straw
wallet
on
his
back

hold
his
fish
and
keep
it
fresh
often
he
is
seen
standing
in
the
water

in
hand
watching
for
a
nibble

scamp

by
the
other
name
of
sosanoō
hotei
is
the
patron
of
contentment
and
of
course
is
the
father
of
happiness
he
does
not
wear
much
clothing
for
the
truth
is
that
all
his
property
consists
of
an
old
ragged
wrapper
a
fan
and
a
wallet

is
as
round
as
a
pudding
and
as
fat
as

out
of
dough

body
is
like
a
lump
of
pastry
and
his
limbs
like
dumplings
he
has
lop
ears
that
hang
down
over
his
shoulders
a
tremendous
double
chin
and
a
round
belly

he
will
not
let
his
beard
grow
long
the
slovenly
old
fellow
never
has
it
shaven
when
he
ought
to
he
is
a
jolly
vagabond
and
never
fit
for
company
but
he
is
a
great
friend
of
the
children
who
romp
over
his
knees
and
shoulders
pull
his
ears
and
climb
up
over
his
shaven
head
he
always
keeps
something
good
for
them
in
his
wallet
sometimes
he
opens
it
wide
and
then
makes
them
guess
what
is
inside
they
try
to
peep
in
but
are
not
tall
enough
to
look
over
the
edge
he
makes
tops
paints
pictures
or
kites
for
the
boys
and
is
the
children
greatest
friend
when
the
seven
patrons
meet
together
hotei
is
apt
to
drink
more
wine
than
is
good
for

only
one

lays
aside
his
dignity
he
has
a
very
grave
countenance
he
is
the
patron
of
talents
his
pet
animal
is
a
spotted
fawn
he
travels
about
a
good
deal
to
find
and
reward
good
boys
who
are
diligent
in
their
studies
and
men
who
are
fitted
to
rule
in
one
hand
he
carries
a
crooked
staff
of
bamboo
at
the
top
of
which
is
hung
a
book
or
roll
of
manuscript
his
dress
is
like
that
of
a
learned
doctor
with
square
cap
stole
and
slippers
bishamon
is
the
patron
of
glory
and
fame
he
is

six
out

worthies
are

the
patron
of
the
family
and
of
the
sea
she
plays
the
flute
and
the
guitar
for
the
others
and
amuses
them
at
their
feasts
sometimes
even
dancing
for
them
her
real
home
is
in
riu
gu
and
she
is
the
queen
of
the
world
under
the
sea
she
often
dwells
in
the
sea
or
ocean
caves
her
favorite
animal
is
the
snake
and
her
servants
are
the
dragons
once
a
year
the
jolly
seven
meet
together
to
talk
over
old
times
relate
their
adventures
and
have
a
supper
together
then
they
proceed
to
business
which
is
to
arrange
all
the
marriages
for
the
coming
year
they
have
a
great
many
hanks
of
red
and
white
silk
which
are
the
threads
of
fate
of
those
to
be
married
the
white
threads
are
the
men
the
red
are
the
women
at
first
they
select
the
threads
very
carefully
and
tie
a
great
many
pairs
or
couples
neatly
and
strongly
together
so
that
the
matches
are
perfect
all
such
marriages
of
threads
make
happy
marriages
among
human
beings
but
they
get
tired
and
lazy
and
instead
of
tying
the
knots
carefully
they
hurry
up
the
work
and
then
jumble
them
carelessly
and
finally
toss
and
tangle
up
all
the
rest
in
a
muss
this
is
the
reason
why
so
many
marriages
are
unhappy
then
they
begin
to
frolic
like
big
boys
benten
plays
the
guitar
and
bishamon
lies
down
on
the
floor
resting
with
his
elbows
to
hear
it
hotei
drinks
wine
out
of
a
shallow
red
cup
as
wide
as
a
dinner
plate
daikoku
and
fukuroku
jin
begin
to
wrestle
and
when
daikoku
gets
his
man
down
he
pounds
his
big
head
with
an
empty
gourd
while
toshitoku
and
ebisu
begin
to
eat
tai
fish
when
this
fun
is
over
benten
and
fukuroku
jin
play
a
game
of
checkers
while
the
others
look
on
and
bet
except
hotei
the
fat
fellow
who
is
asleep
then
they
get
ashamed
of
themselves
for
gambling
and
after
a
few
days
the
party
breaks
up
and
each
one
goes
to
his
regular
business
again
daikoku
and
the
oni
a
long
while
ago
when
the
idols
of
buddha
and
his
host
of
disciples
came
to
japan
after
traveling
through
china
from
india
they
were
very
much
vexed
because
the
people
still
liked
the
little
black
fellow
named
daikoku
even
when
they
became
buddhists
they
still
burned
incense
to
daikoku
because
he
was
the
patron
of
wealth
for
everybody
then
as
now
wanted
to
be
rich
so
the
buddhist
idols
determined
to
get
rid
of
the
little
fat
fellow
how
to
do
it
was
the
question
at
last
they
called
yemma
the
judge
of
the
lower
regions
and
gave
him
the
power
to
destroy
daikoku
now
yemma
had
under
him
a
whole
legion
of
some
green
some
black
others
blue
as
indigo
and
others
of
a
vermillion
color
which
he
usually
sent
on
ordinary
errands
but
for
so
important
an
expedition
he
now
called
shino
a
very
cunning
old
fellow
and
ordered
him
to
kill
or
remove
daikoku
out
of
the
way
shino
made
his
bow
to
his
master
tightened
his
belt
around
his
loins
and
set
off
it
was
not
an
easy
thing
to
find
daikoku
even
though
every
one
worshipped
him
so
the
oni
had
to
travel
a
long
way
and
ask
a
great
many
questions
of
people
and
often
lose
his
way
before
he
got
any
clue
one
day
he
met
a
sparrow
who
directed
him
to
daikoku
palace
where
among
all
his
and
treasure
piled
to
the
ceiling
the
fat
and
fellow
was
accustomed
to
sit
eating
daikon
radish
and
amuse
himself
with
his
favorite
pets
the
rats
around
him
was
stored
in
straw
bags
his
rice
which
he
considered
more
precious
than
money
entering
the
gate
the
oni
peeped
about
cautiously
but
saw
no
one
he
went
further
on
till
he
came
to
a
large
store
house
standing
alone
and
built
in
the
shape
of
a
huge
not
a
door
or
window
could
be
seen
but
climbing
up
a
narrow
plank
set
against
the
top
edge
he
peeped
over
and
there
sat
daikoku
the
oni
descended
and
got
into
the
room
then
he
thought
it
would
be
an
easy
thing
to
pounce
upon
daikoku
he
was
already
chuckling
to
himself
over
the
prospect
of
such
wealth
being
his
own
when
daikoku
squeaked
out
to
his
chief
rat
rat
i
feel
some
strange
creature
must
be
near
go
chase
him
off
the
premises
away
scampered
the
rat
to
the
garden
and
plucked
a
sprig
of
holly
with
leaves
full
of
thorns
like
needles
with
this
in
his
he
ran
at
the
oni
whacked
him
soundly
and
stuck
him
all
over
with
the
sharp
prickles
the
oni
yelling
with
pain
ran
away
as
fast
as
he
could
run
he
was
so
frightened
that
he
never
stopped
until
he
reached
yemma
palace
when
he
fell
down
breathless
he
then
told
his
master
the
tale
of
his
adventure
but
begged
that
he
might
never
again
be
sent
against
daikoku
so
the
buddhist
idols
finding
they
could
not
banish
or
kill
daikoku
agreed
to
recognize
him
and
so
they
made
peace
with
him
and
to
this
day
buddhists
and
shintōists
alike
worship
the
fat
little
god
of
wealth
when
people
heard
how
the
chief
oni
had
been
driven
away
by
only
a
rat
armed
with
holly
they
thought
it
a
good
thing
to
keep
off
all
oni
so
ever
afterward
even
to
this
day
after
driving
out
all
the
bad
creatures
with
parched
beans
they
place
sprigs
of
holly
at
their
on
new
year
eve
to
keep
away
the
oni
and
all
evil
spirits
benkei
and
the
bell
on
one
of
the
hills
overlooking
the
blue
sky
mirror
of
lake
biwa
stands
the
ancient
monastery
of
miidera
which
was
founded
over
years
ago
by
the
pious
mikado
tenchi
near
the
entrance
on
a
platform
constructed
of
stoutest
timbers
stands
a
bronze
bell
five
and
a
half
feet
high
it
has
on
it
none
of
the
superscriptions
so
commonly
found
on
japanese
bells
and
though
its
surface
is
covered
with
scratches
it
was
once
as
brilliant
as
a
mirror
this
old
bell
which
is
visited
by
thousands
of
people
from
all
parts
of
japan
who
come
to
wonder
at
it
is
remarkable
for
many
things
over
two
thousand
years
ago
say
the
bonzes
it
hung
in
the
temple
of
gihon
shoja
in
india
which
buddha
built
after
his
death
it
got
into
the
possession
of
the
dragon
king
of
the
world
under
the
sea
when
the
hero
toda
the
archer
shot
the
enemy
of
the
queen
of
the
she
presented
him
with
many
treasures
and
among
them
this
great
bell
which
she
caused
to
be
landed
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
toda
however
was
not
able
to
remove
it
so
he
presented
it
to
the
monks
at
miidera
with
great
labor
it
was
brought
to
the
and
hung
in
this
belfry
where
it
rung
out
daily
matins
and
orisons
filling
the
lake
and
hill
sides
with
sweet
melody
now
it
was
one
of
the
rules
of
the
buddhists
that
no
woman
should
be
allowed
to
ascend
the
hill
or
enter
the
monastery
of
miidera
the
bonzes
associated
females
and
wicked
influences
together
hence
the
prohibition
a
noted
beauty
of
kioto
hearing
of
the
polished
face
of
the
bell
resolved
in
spite
of
the
law
against
her
sex
to
ascend
the
hill
to
dress
her
hair
and
powder
her
face
in
the
surface
of
the
bell
so
selecting
an
hour
when
she
knew
the
priests
would
be
too
busy
at
study
of
the
sacred
rolls
to
notice
her
she
ascended
the
hill
and
entered
the
belfry
looking
into
the
smooth
surface
she
saw
her
own
sparkling
eyes
her
cheeks
flushed
rosy
with
exercise
her
dimples
playing
and
then
her
whole
form
reflected
as
in
her
own
silver
mirror
before
which
she
daily
sat
charmed
as
much
by
the
vastness
as
the
brilliancy
of
the
reflection
she
stretched
forth
her
hand
and
touching
her
to
the
bell
prayed
aloud
that
she
might
possess
just
such
a
mirror
of
equal
size
and
brightness
but
the
bell
was
outraged
at
the
impiety
of
the
woman
touch
and
the
cold
metal
shrank
back
leaving
a
hollow
place
and
spoiling
the
even
surface
of
the
bell
from
that
time
forth
the
bell
gradually
lost
its
polish
and
became
dull
and
finally
dark
like
other
bells
when
benkei
was
a
monk
he
was
possessed
of
a
mighty
desire
to
steal
this
bell
and
hang
it
up
at
hiyeisan
so
one
night
he
went
over
to
miidera
hill
and
cautiously
crept
up
to
the
belfry
and
unhooked
it
from
the
great
iron
link
which
held
it
how
to
get
it
down
the
mountain
was
now
the
question
should
he
let
it
roll
down
the
monks
at
miidera
would
hear
it
bumping
over
the
stones
nor
could
he
carry
it
in
his
arms
for
it
was
too
big
around
feet
for
him
to
grasp
and
hold
he
could
not
put
his
head
in
it
like
a
candle
in
a
snuffer
for
then
he
would
not
be
able
to
see
his
way
down
so
climbing
into
the
belfry
he
pulled
out
the
with
the
iron
link
and
hanging
on
the
bell
put
the
beam
on
his
shoulder
to
carry
it
in
style
that
is
like
a
pair
of
scales
the
next
difficulty
was
to
balance
it
for
he
had
nothing
but
his
lantern
to
hang
on
the
other
end
of
the
beam
to
balance
the
bell
it
was
a
prodigiously
hard
task
to
carry
his
burden
the
six
or
seven
miles
distance
to
hiyeisan
it
was
trying
to
balance
a
bronze
bell
with
a
paper
lantern
the
work
made
him
puff
and
blow
and
sweat
until
he
was
as
hungry
as
a
badger
but
he
finally
succeeded
in
hooking
it
up
in
the
belfry
at
hiyeisan
then
all
the
fellow
priests
of
benkei
got
up
though
at
night
to
welcome
him
they
admired
his
bravery
and
strength
and
wished
to
strike
the
bell
at
once
to
show
their
joy
no
i
wo
lift
a
hammer
or
sound
a
note
till
you
make
me
some
soup
i
am
terribly
hungry
said
benkei
as
he
sat
down
on
a
cross
piece
of
the
belfry
and
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
cowl
then
the
priests
got
out
the
iron
five
feet
in
diameter
and
kindling
a
fire
made
a
huge
mess
of
soup
and
served
it
to
benkei
the
lusty
monk
sipped
bowl
after
bowl
of
the
steaming
nourishment
until
the
pot
was
empty
now
said
he
you
may
sound
the
bell
five
or
six
of
the
young
bonzes
mounted
the
platform
and
seized
the
rope
that
held
the
heavy
log
suspended
from
the
roof
the
manner
of
striking
the
bell
was
to
pull
back
the
log
several
feet
then
let
go
the
rope
holding
the
log
after
the
rebound
at
the
first
stroke
the
bell
quivered
and
rolled
out
a
most
mournful
and
solemn
sound
which
as
it
softened
and
died
away
changed
into
the
distinct
murmur
i
want
to
go
back
to
miidera
i
want
to
go
back
to
miidera
i
want
to
back
naru
hodo
said
the
priests
what
a
strange
bell
it
wants
to
go
back
it
is
not
satisfied
with
our
ringing
ah
i
know
what
is
the
matter
said
the
aged
abbot
it
must
be
sprinkled
with
holy
water
of
hiyeisan
then
it
will
be
happy
with
us
ho
page
bring
hither
the
deep
sea
shell
full
of
sacred
water
so
the
pure
white
shell
full
of
the
consecrated
water
was
brought
together
with
the
holy
man
brush
dipping
it
in
the
water
the
abbot
sprinkled
the
bell
inside
and
out
i
dedicate
thee
oh
bell
to
hiyeisan
now
strike
said
he
signalling
to
the
again
the
young
men
mounted
the
platform
drew
back
the
log
with
a
lusty
pull
and
let
fly
miidera
ye
ko
i
want
to
go
back
to
miidera
moaned
out
the
homesick
bell
this
so
enraged
benkei
that
he
rushed
to
the
rope
waved
the
monks
aside
and
seizing
the
rope
strained
every
muscle
to
jerk
the
beam
its
entire
length
afield
and
then
let
fly
with
force
enough
to
crack
the
bell
for
a
moment
the
dense
volume
of
sound
filled
the
ears
of
all
like
a
storm
but
as
the
vibrations
died
away
the
bell
whined
out
i
want
to
go
back
to
miidera
sobbed
the
bell
whether
struck
at
morning
noon
or
night
the
bell
said
the
same
words
no
matter
when
by
whom
how
hard
or
how
gently
it
was
struck
the
bell
moaned
the
one
plaint
as
if
crying
i
want
to
go
back
to
miidera
i
want
to
go
back
to
miidera
at
last
benkei
in
a
rage
unhooked
the
bell
shouldered
it
beam
and
all
and
set
off
to
take
it
back
carrying
the
bell
to
the
top
of
hiyeisan
he
set
it
down
and
giving
it
a
kick
rolled
it
down
the
valley
toward
miidera
and
left
it
there
then
the
miidera
bonzes
hung
it
up
again
since
that
time
the
bell
has
completely
changed
its
note
until
now
it
is
just
like
other
bells
in
sound
and
behavior
little
silver
dream
of
the
shoji
ko
gin
san
miss
little
silver
was
a
young
maid
who
did
not
care
for
strange
stories
of
animals
so
much
as
for
those
of
in
the
form
of
human
beings
even
of
these
however
she
did
not
like
to
dream
and
when
the
foolish
old
nurse
would
tell
her
ghost
stories
at
night
she
was
terribly
afraid
they
would
appear
to
her
in
her
sleep
to
avoid
this
the
old
nurse
told
her
to
draw
pictures
of
a
tapir
on
the
sheet
of
white
paper
which
wrapped
round
the
tiny
pillow
makes
the
of
every
young
lady
who
rests
her
head
on
two
inches
of
a
bolster
in
order
to
keep
her
hair
from
being
mussed
or
rumpled
old
grannies
and
country
folks
believe
that
if
you
have
a
picture
of
a
tapir
under
the
bed
or
on
the
paper
you
will
not
have
unpleasant
dreams
as
the
tapir
is
said
to
eat
them
so
strongly
do
some
people
believe
this
that
they
sleep
under
quilts
figured
with
the
device
of
this
beast
if
in
spite
of
this
precaution
one
should
have
a
bad
dream
he
must
cry
out
on
awaking
tapir
come
eat
tapir
come
eat
when
the
tapir
will
swallow
the
dream
and
no
evil
results
will
happen
to
the
dreamer
little
silver
listened
with
both
eyes
and
open
mouth
to
this
account
of
the
tapir
and
then
making
the
picture
and
wrapping
it
around
her
pillow
she
fell
asleep
i
suspect
that
the
kowameshi
red
rice
of
which
she
had
eaten
so
heartily
at
supper
time
until
her
waist
strings
tightened
had
something
to
do
with
her
travels
in
she
thought
she
had
gone
down
to
ozaka
and
there
got
on
a
junk
and
sailed
far
away
to
the
southwest
through
the
inland
sea
one
night
the
water
seemed
full
of
white
ghosts
of
men
and
women
some
of
them
were
walking
on
and
in
the
water
some
were
running
about
here
and
there
groups
appeared
to
be
talking
together
once
in
a
while
the
junk
would
run
against
one
of
them
and
when
little
silver
looked
to
see
if
he
were
hurt
or
knocked
over
she
could
see
nothing
until
the
junk
passed
by
when
the
ghost
would
appear
standing
in
the
same
place
as
though
the
ship
had
gone
through
empty
air
occasionally
a
ghost
would
come
up
to
the
side
of
the
ship
and
in
a
squeaky
voice
ask
for
a
dipper
while
she
would
be
wondering
what
a
ghost
wanted
to
do
with
a
dipper
a
sailor
would
quietly
open
a
locker
take
out
a
dipper
having
no
bottom
and
give
one
every
time
he
was
asked
for
them
little
silver
noticed
a
large
bundle
of
these
dippers
ready
the
ghosts
would
then
begin
to
bail
up
water
out
of
the
sea
to
empty
it
in
the
boat
all
night
they
followed
the
junk
holding
on
with
one
hand
to
the
gunwale
while
they
vainly
dipped
up
water
with
the
other
trying
to
swamp
the
boat
if
dippers
with
bottoms
in
them
had
been
given
them
the
sailors
said
the
boat
would
have
been
sunk
when
daylight
appeared
the
shadowy
host
of
people
vanished
in
the
morning
they
passed
an
island
the
shores
of
which
were
high
rocks
of
red
coral
a
great
earthen
jar
stood
on
the
beach
and
around
it
lay
ladles
holding
a
or
more
and
piles
of
very
large
shallow
red
lacquered
wine
cups
which
seemed
as
big
as
the
full
moon
after
the
sun
had
been
risen
some
time
there
came
down
from
over
the
hills
a
troop
of
the
most
curious
looking
people
many
were
short
little
folks
that
looked
very
old
or
rather
they
seemed
old
before
they
ought
to
be
some
were
very
aged
and
crooked
with
faces
and
hair
of
a
reddish
gray
tint
all
the
others
had
long
scarlet
locks
hanging
loose
over
their
heads
and
streaming
down
their
backs
their
faces
were
flushed
as
if
by
hard
drinking
and
their
pimpled
noses
resembled
huge
red
barnacles
no
sooner
did
they
arrive
at
the
great
earthen
jar
than
they
ranged
themselves
round
it
the
old
ones
dipped
out
ladles
full
and
drank
of
the
wine
till
they
reeled
the
younger
ones
poured
the
liquor
into
cups
and
drank
even
the
little
infants
guzzled
quantities
of
the
yellow
saké
from
the
shallow
cups
of
very
thin
wood
then
began
the
dance
and
wild
and
furious
it
was
the
old
sots
tossed
their
long
locks
in
the
air
and
pirouetted
round
the
big
saké
jar
the
younger
ones
of
all
ages
clapped
their
hands
knotted
their
handkerchiefs
over
their
foreheads
waved
their
dippers
or
cups
or
fans
and
practiced
all
kinds
of
antics
while
their
scarlet
hair
streamed
in
the
wind
or
was
blown
in
their
eyes
the
dance
over
they
threw
down
their
cups
and
dippers
rested
a
few
minutes
and
then
took
another
heavy
drink
all
around
now
to
work
shouted
an
old
fellow
whose
face
was
redder
than
his
hair
and
who
having
only
two
teeth
like
tusks
left
looked
just
like
an
imp
as
for
his
wife
her
teeth
had
long
ago
fallen
out
and
the
skin
of
her
face
seemed
to
have
added
a
pucker
for
every
year
since
a
half
century
had
rolled
over
her
head
then
little
silver
looked
and
saw
them
scatter
some
gathered
shells
and
burned
them
to
make
lime
others
carried
water
and
made
mortar
which
they
thickened
by
a
pulp
made
of
paper
and
a
glue
made
by
boiling
fish
skin
some
dived
under
the
sea
for
red
coral
which
they
hauled
up
by
means
of
straw
ropes
in
great
sprigs
as
thick
as
the
branches
of
a
tree
they
quickly
ran
up
a
scaffold
and
while
some
of
the
plasterers
smeared
the
walls
others
below
passed
up
the
tempered
mortar
on
long
shell
shovels
to
the
hand
even
at
work
they
had
casks
and
cups
of
saké
at
hand
while
children
played
in
the
empty
kegs
and
licked
the
gummy
sugar
left
in
some
of
them
what
is
that
house
for
asked
little
silver
of
the
sailors
oh
that
is
the
kura
storehouse
in
which
the
king
of
the
shōji
stores
the
treasures
of
life
and
health
and
happiness
and
property
which
men
throw
away
or
exchange
for
the
saké
which
he
gives
them
by
making
funnels
of
themselves
oh
yes
said
little
silver
to
herself
as
she
remembered
how
her
father
had
said
of
a
certain
neighbor
who
had
lately
been
drinking
hard
he
swills
saké
like
a
shōji
she
also
understood
why
picnic
or
boxes
were
often
decorated
with
pictures
of
shōji
with
their
cups
and
dippers
for
at
these
picnics
many
men
get
drunk
so
much
so
indeed
that
after
a
while
the
master
of
the
feast
orders
very
poor
and
cheap
wine
to
be
served
to
the
guests
he
also
replaces
the
delicate
wine
cups
of
porcelain
with
big
thick
or
wooden
bowls
for
the
guests
when
drunk
do
not
know
the
difference
she
also
now
understood
why
it
was
commonly
said
of
a
matsu
who
had
once
been
very
rich
but
was
now
a
poor
sot
his
property
has
all
gone
to
the
shōji
just
then
the
ship
in
which
she
was
sailing
struck
a
rock
and
the
sudden
jerk
woke
up
little
silver
who
cried
out
tapir
come
eat
tapir
come
eat
no
tapir
came
but
if
he
had
i
fear
little
silver
would
have
been
more
frightened
than
she
was
by
her
dream
of
the
ghosts
for
next
morning
she
laughed
to
think
how
they
had
all
their
work
water
for
nothing
and
at
her
old
nurse
for
thinking
a
picture
of
a
tapir
could
keep
off
dreams
the
tengus
or
the
elves
with
long
noses
after
hokusai
curious
creatures
are
the
tengus
with
the
head
of
a
hawk
and
the
body
of
a
man
they
have
very
hairy
hands
or
paws
with
two
fingers
and
feet
with
two
toes
they
are
hatched
out
of
eggs
and
have
wings
and
feathers
until
full
grown
then
their
wings
moult
and
the
stumps
are
concealed
behind
their
dress
which
is
like
that
of
a
man
they
walk
when
grown
up
on
clogs
a
foot
high
which
are
like
stilts
as
they
have
but
one
support
instead
of
two

the
sort
which
men

about
easily
on
these
without
stumbling
the

a
scowling
individual
with
a
very
proud
expression
and
a
nose
about
eight
long
when
he
goes
abroad
his
retainers
march
before
him
for
fear
he
might
break
his
nose
against
something
he
wears
a
long
grey
beard
down
to
his
girdle
and
moustaches
to
his
chin
in
his
left
hand
he
carries
a
large
fan
made
of
seven
wide
feathers
this
is
the
sign
of
his
rank
he
has
a
mouth
but
he
rarely
opens
it
he
is
very
wise
and
rules

a
long
beak
in
the
place
where
his

ought
to
be

looks
as
if
some
one
had
squeezed
out
the
lower
part
of
his
face
and
pulled
his
nose
down
so
as
to
make
a
beak
like
a
crow

this
lad
while
a
pupil
in
the
monastery
would
slip
out
in
the
evening
when
the
priests
thought
him
asleep
and
come
to
the
king
of
the
tengus
who
instructed
him
in
the
military
arts
in
cunning
magic
and
wisdom
every
night
the
boy
would
spread
the
roll
of
wisdom
before
him
and
sit
at
the
feet
of
the
tengu
and
learn
the
strange
letters
in
which
tengu
wisdom
is
written
while
the
servant
tengus
propped
up
on
their
looked
on
the
boy
was
not
afraid
but
quickly
learned
the
knowledge
which
birds
beasts
and
fishes
have
how
to
understand
their
language
and
to
fly
swim
and
leap
like
them
when
a
tengu
stumbles
and
falls
down
on
his
nose
it
takes
a
long
while
to
heal
and
if
he
breaks
it
the
doctor
puts
it
in
splints
like
a
broken
arm
until
it
straightens
out
and
heals
up
again
some
of
the
amusements
in
are
very
curious
a
pair
of
young
tengus
will
fence
with
their
noses
as
if
they
were
foils
their
faces
are
well
protected
by
masks
for
if
one
tengu
should
poke
his
nose
into
the
other
eye
he
might
put
it
out
and
a
blind
tengu
could
not
walk
about
because
he
would
be
knocking
his
nose
against
everything
two
old
tengus
with
noses
nearly
two
feet
long
sometimes
try
the
strength
of
their
one
fellow
has
his
beak
straight
up
in
the
air
like
a
supporting
post
while
the
other
sits
a
yard
off
with
his
elastic
nose
stretched
across
like
a
and
tied
with
twine
at
the
top
of
the
other
one
nose
on
this
tight
a
little
tengu
boy
with
a
tiny
pug
only
two
inches
long
dances
a
jig
he
holds
an
umbrella
in
his
hand
now
dancing
and
now
standing
upon
one
foot
the
whose
nose
serves
as
a
waves
his
fan
and
sings
a
song
keeping
time
to
the
dance
there
is
another
tengu
who
sometimes
quarrels
with
his
wife
and
when
angry
boxes
her
ears
with
his
nose
a
who
is
inclined
to
be
literary
and
sentimental
writes
poetry
when
the
mood
seizes
her
she
ties
the
pen
to
her
nose
dips
it
in
ink
and
writes
a
poem
on
the
wall
a
makes
a
brush
to
whitewash
the
ceiling
by
strapping
it
to
his
nose
sometimes
the
little
tengus
get
fighting
and
then
the
feathers
fly
as
they
tear
each
other
with
their
little
claws
which
have
talons
on
them
shaped
like
a
chicken
but
which
when
fully
grown
look
like
hands
all
the
big
tengus
are
fond
of
trying
the
strength
of
their
noses
and
how
far
they
can
bend
them
up
and
down
without
breaking
they
have
two
favorite
games
of
which
they
sometimes
give
exhibitions
the
player
has
long
strings
of
iron
cash
that
is
one
hundred
of
the
little
iron
coins
with
a
square
hole
in
the
centre
several
of
these
he
slides
on
a
rope
like
buttons
on
a
string
or
counters
on
a
wire
then
he
lifts
them
off
with
the
tip
of
his
nose
sometimes
his
nose
bends
so
much
under
the
weight
that
the
coins
slip
off
whichever
tengu
can
pick
off
the
greater
number
of
strings
without
letting
any
slip
wins
the
game
and
is
called
the
king
of
noses
another
balances
hoops
and
poles
on
his
nose
and
throws
balls
through
the
hoops
or
he
poises
a
saucer
of
water
on
the
tip
of
his
nose
without
spilling
a
drop
another
fellow
hangs
a
bell
from
the
ceiling
then
with
a
handkerchief
tied
loosely
round
his
head
he
pulls
his
nose
back
like
a
beak
and
then
suddenly
lets
go
his
nose
then
strikes
the
bell
and
rings
it
it
hurts
very
much
but
he
does
not
mind
it
the
tengus
have
one
great
fault
they
love
liquor
too
much
they
often
get
drunk
they
buy
great
casks
of
sling
them
round
their
necks
and
drink
out
of
long
cups
shaped
like
their
faces
using
the
nose
for
a
handle
a
drunken
tengu
makes
a
funny
sight
as
he
staggers
about
with
his
big
wings
drooping
and
flapping
around
him
and
the
feathers
trailing
in
the
mud
and
his
long
nose
limp
pendulous
and
groggy
when
the
master
of
the
tengus
wishes
to
see
the
flowers
which
means
to
go
on
a
picnic
he
punishes
his
drunken
servant
by
swinging
the
box
of
eatables
over
the
fellow
red
nose
putting
the
end
over
his
shoulders
he
compels
the
sot
to
come
along
it
sobers
the
fellow
for
the
weight
on
his
nose
and
the
pulling
on
it
hurts
dreadfully
and
often
makes
him
squeal
oyama
a
mountain
near
tokio
is
said
to
be
full
of
these
elves
but
many
other
mountains
are
inhabited
by
them
for
they
like
lonely
places
away
from
men
dancers
often
put
on
masks
like
the
tengu
face
and
dance
a
curious
dance
which
they
call
the
tengu
quadrille
the
tengus
are
very
proud
fellows
and
think
themselves
above
human
beings
they
are
afraid
of
brave
men
however
and
never
dare
to
hurt
them
they
scare
children
especially
bad
boys
they
watch
a
boy
telling
lies
and
catch
him
then
the
tengus
pull
out
his
tongue
by
the
roots
and
run
away
with
it
when
a
tengu
walks
he
folds
his
arms
throws
back
his
head
till
his
nose
is
far
up
in
the
air
and
struts
around
as
if
he
were
a
daimio
when
a
man
becomes
vain
and
carries
his
nose
too
high
the
people
say
he
has
become
a
tengu
kintaro
or
the
wild
baby
long
long
ago
when
the
tallest
fir
trees
on
the
hakoné
mountains
were
no
higher
than
a
there
lived
in
that
part
of
the
range
called
ashigara
a
little
ruddy
boy
whom
his
mother
had
named
kintarō
or
golden
darling
he
was
not
like
other
boys
for
having
no
children
to
play
with
he
made
companions
of
the
wild
animals
of
the
forest
he
romped
with
the
little
bears
and
often
when
the
old
she
bear
would
come
for
her
cubs
to
give
them
their
supper
and
put
them
to
bed
kintarō
would
jump
on
her
back
and
have
a
ride
to
her
cave
he
also
put
his
arms
around
the
neck
of
the
deer
which
were
not
afraid
of
him
he
was
prince
of
the
forest
and
the
rabbits
wild
boars
squirrels
and
martens
pheasants
and
hawks
were
his
servants
and
messengers
although
not
much
more
than
a
fat
baby
kintarō
wielded
a
big
axe
and
could
chop
a
snake
to
pieces
before
he
had
time
to
wriggle
kintarō
father
had
been
a
brave
soldier
in
kiōto
who
through
the
malice
of
enemies
at
court
had
fallen
into
disgrace
he
had
loved
a
beautiful
lady
whom
he
married
when
her
husband
died
she
fled
eastward
to
the
ashigara
mountains
and
there
in
the
lonely
forests
in
which
no
human
being
except
poor
woodcutters
ever
came
her
boy
was
born
she
lived
in
a
cave
nourishing
herself
on
roots
and
herbs
the
woodcutters
soon
learned
about
the
strange
pair
living
wild
but
peacefully
in
the
woods
though
they
did
not
dream
of
her
noble
rank
the
boy
was
known
among
them
as
little
wonder
and
the
woman
as
the
old
nurse
of
the
mountain
thus
all
alone
the
little
fellow
grew
up
exercising
himself
daily
so
that
even
though
a
child
he
could
easily
wrestle
with
a
bear
among
his
retainers
were
the
tengus
though
they
were
often
rebellious
and
disobedient
not
liking
to
be
governed
by
a
boy
one
day
an
old
who
had
always
laughed
at
the
idea
of
obeying
a
little
dumpling
of
a
fellow
like
kintarō
flew
up
to
her
nest
in
a
high
fir
tree
kintarō
watched
to
see
where
it
was
and
waited
till
she
left
it
to
go
and
seek
for
food
then
going
up
to
the
tree
he
shook
it
with
all
his
might
until
the
nest
came
tumbling
down
and
the
two
young
squabs
of
tengus
with
it
now
it
happened
that
just
at
that
time
the
great
hero
and
raikō
was
marching
through
the
mountains
on
his
way
to
kiōto
seeing
that
the
ruddy
little
fellow
was
no
ordinary
child
he
found
out
the
mother
and
heard
her
story
he
then
asked
for
the
child
and
adopted
him
as
his
own
so
kintarō
went
off
with
raikō
and
grew
up
to
be
a
brave
soldier
and
taking
his
father
name
he
was
known
as
sakata
kintoki
his
mother
however
remained
in
the
mountains
and
living
to
an
extreme
old
age
was
always
known
as
the
old
nurse
of
the
mountains
to
this
day
kintaro
is
the
hero
of
japanese
boys
and
on
their
huge
kites
will
usually
be
seen
a
picture
of
the
little
ruddy
boy
of
the
mountains
with
his
axe
while
around
him
are
his
wild
playmates
and
the
young
tengus
rubbing
their
long
noses
which
were
so
nearly
broken
by
their
fall
jiraiya
or
the
magic
frog
ogata
was
the
name
of
a
who
lived
in
the
island
of
the
nine
provinces
kiushiu
he
had
but
one
son
an
infant
whom
the
people
in
admiration
nicknamed
jiraiya
young
thunder
during
one
of
the
civil
wars
this
castle
was
taken
and
ogata
was
slain
but
by
the
aid
of
a
faithful
retainer
who
hid
jiraiya
in
his
bosom
the
boy
escaped
and
fled
northward
to
echigo
there
he
lived
until
he
grew
up
to
manhood
at
that
time
echigo
was
infested
with
robbers
one
day
the
faithful
retainer
of
jiraiya
being
attacked
made
resistance
and
was
slain
by
the
robbers
jiraiya
now
left
alone
in
the
world
went
out
from
echigo
and
led
a
wandering
life
in
several
provinces
all
this
time
he
was
consumed
with
the
desire
to
revive
the
name
of
his
father
and
restore
the
fortunes
of
his
family
being
exceedingly
brave
and
an
expert
swordsman
he
became
chief
of
a
band
of
robbers
and
plundered
many
wealthy
merchants
and
in
a
short
time
he
was
rich
in
men
arms
and
booty
he
was
accustomed
to
disguise
himself
and
go
in
person
into
the
houses
and
presence
of
men
of
wealth
and
thus
learn
all
about
their
gates
and
guards
where
they
slept
and
in
what
rooms
their
treasures
were
stored
so
that
success
was
easy
hearing
of
an
old
man
who
lived
in
shinano
he
started
to
rob
him
and
for
this
purpose
put
on
the
disguise
of
a
pilgrim
shinano
is
a
very
high
full
of
mountains
and
the
snow
lies
deep
in
winter
a
great
snow
storm
coming
on
jiraiya
took
refuge
in
a
humble
house
by
the
way
entering
he
found
a
very
beautiful
woman
who
treated
him
with
great
kindness
this
however
did
not
change
the
robber
nature
at
midnight
when
all
was
still
he
unsheathed
his
sword
and
going
noiselessly
to
her
room
he
found
the
lady
absorbed
in
reading
lifting
his
sword
he
was
about
to
strike
at
her
neck
when
in
a
flash
her
body
changed
into
that
of
a
very
old
man
who
seized
the
heavy
steel
blade
and
broke
it
in
pieces
as
though
it
were
a
stick
then
he
tossed
the
bits
of
steel
away
and
thus
spoke
to
jiraiya
who
stood
amazed
but
fearless
i
am
a
man
named
senso
dojin
and
i
have
lived
in
these
mountains
many
hundred
years
though
my
true
body
is
that
of
a
huge
frog
i
can
easily
put
you
to
death
but
i
have
another
purpose
so
i
shall
pardon
you
and
teach
you
magic
instead
then
the
youth
bowed
his
head
to
the
floor
poured
out
his
thanks
to
the
old
man
and
begged
to
be
received
as
his
pupil
remaining
with
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
for
several
weeks
jiraiya
learned
all
the
arts
of
the
mountain
spirits
how
to
cause
a
storm
of
wind
and
rain
to
make
a
deluge
and
to
control
the
elements
at
will
he
also
learned
how
to
govern
the
frogs
and
at
his
bidding
they
assumed
gigantic
size
so
that
on
their
backs
he
could
stand
up
and
cross
rivers
and
carry
enormous
loads
when
the
old
man
had
finished
instructing
him
he
said
henceforth
cease
from
robbing
or
in
any
way
injuring
the
poor
take
from
the
wicked
rich
and
those
who
acquire
money
dishonestly
but
help
the
needy
and
the
suffering
thus
speaking
the
old
man
turned
into
a
huge
frog
and
hopped
away
what
this
old
mountain
spirit
bade
him
do
was
just
what
jiraiya
wished
to
accomplish
he
set
out
on
his
journey
with
a
light
heart
i
can
now
make
the
storm
and
the
waters
obey
me
and
all
the
frogs
are
at
my
command
but
alas
the
magic
of
the
frog
can
not
control
that
of
the
serpent
i
shall
beware
of
his
poison
from
that
time
forth
the
oppressed
poor
people
rejoiced
many
a
time
as
the
avaricious
merchants
and
extortionate
money
lenders
lost
their
treasures
for
when
a
poor
farmer
whose
crops
failed
could
not
pay
his
rent
or
loan
on
the
date
promised
these
money
lenders
would
turn
him
out
of
his
house
seize
his
beds
and
mats
and
and
even
the
shrine
and
images
on
the
to
sell
them
at
auction
for
a
trifle
to
their
minions
who
resold
them
at
a
high
price
for
the
who
thus
got
a
double
benefit
whenever
a
miser
was
robbed
the
people
said
the
young
thunder
has
struck
and
then
they
were
glad
knowing
that
it
was
jiraiya
young
thunder
in
this
manner
his
name
soon
grew
to
be
the
poor
people
watchword
in
those
troublous
times
yet
jiraiya
was
always
ready
to
help
the
innocent
and
honest
even
if
they
were
rich
one
day
a
merchant
named
fukutaro
was
sentenced
to
death
though
he
was
really
not
guilty
jiraiya
hearing
of
it
went
to
the
magistrate
and
said
that
he
himself
was
the
very
man
who
committed
the
robbery
so
the
man
life
was
saved
and
jiraiya
was
hanged
on
a
large
oak
tree
but
during
the
night
his
dead
body
changed
into
a
which
hopped
away
out
of
sight
and
off
into
the
mountains
of
shinano
at
this
time
there
was
living
in
this
province
a
young
and
beautiful
maiden
named
tsunadé
her
character
was
very
lovely
she
was
always
obedient
to
her
parents
and
kind
to
her
friends
her
daily
task
was
to
go
to
the
mountains
and
cut
brushwood
for
fuel
one
day
while
thus
busy
singing
at
the
task
she
met
a
very
old
man
with
a
long
white
beard
sweeping
his
breast
who
said
to
her
do
not
fear
me
i
have
lived
in
this
mountain
many
hundred
years
but
my
real
body
is
that
of
a
snail
i
will
teach
you
the
powers
of
magic
so
that
you
can
walk
on
the
sea
or
cross
a
river
however
swift
and
deep
as
though
it
were
dry
land
gladly
the
maiden
took
daily
lessons
of
the
old
man
and
soon
was
able
to
walk
on
the
waters
as
on
the
mountain
paths
one
day
the
old
man
said
i
shall
now
leave
you
and
resume
my
former
shape
use
your
power
to
destroy
wicked
robbers
help
those
who
defend
the
poor
i
advise
you
to
marry
the
celebrated
man
jiraiya
and
thus
you
will
unite
your
powers
thus
saying
the
old
man
shrivelled
up
into
a
snail
and
crawled
away
i
am
glad
said
the
maiden
to
herself
for
the
magic
of
the
snail
can
overcome
that
of
the
serpent
when
jiraiya
who
has
the
magic
of
the
frog
shall
marry
me
we
can
then
destroy
the
son
of
the
serpent
the
robber
named
orochimaru
by
good
fortune
jiraiya
met
the
maiden
tsunadé
and
being
charmed
with
her
beauty
and
knowing
her
power
of
magic
sent
a
messenger
with
presents
to
her
parents
asking
them
to
give
him
their
daughter
to
wife
the
parents
agreed
and
so
the
young
and
loving
couple
were
married
hitherto
when
jiraiya
wished
to
cross
a
river
he
changed
himself
into
a
frog
and
swam
across
or
he
summoned
a
before
him
which
increased
in
size
until
as
large
as
an
elephant
then
standing
erect
on
his
warty
back
even
though
the
wind
blew
his
garments
wildly
jiraiya
reached
the
opposite
shore
in
safety
but
now
with
his
wife
powers
the
two
without
any
delay
walked
over
as
though
the
surface
was
a
hard
floor
soon
after
their
marriage
war
broke
out
in
japan
between
the
two
famous
clans
of
tsukikagé
and
inukagé
to
help
them
fight
their
battles
and
capture
the
castles
of
their
enemies
the
tsukikagé
family
besought
the
aid
of
jiraiya
who
agreed
to
serve
them
and
carried
their
banner
in
his
back
their
enemies
the
inukagé
then
secured
the
services
of
this
orochimaru
or
was
a
very
wicked
robber
whose
father
was
a
man
and
whose
mother
was
a
serpent
that
lived
in
the
bottom
of
lake
takura
he
was
perfectly
skilled
in
the
magic
of
the
serpent
and
by
spurting
venom
on
his
enemies
could
destroy
the
strongest
warriors
collecting
thousands
of
followers
he
made
great
ravages
in
all
parts
of
japan
robbing
and
murdering
good
and
bad
rich
and
poor
alike
loving
war
and
destruction
he
joined
his
forces
with
the
inukagé
family
now
that
the
magic
of
the
frog
and
snail
was
joined
to
the
one
army
and
the
magic
of
the
serpent
aided
the
other
the
conflicts
were
bloody
and
terrible
and
many
men
were
slain
on
both
sides
on
one
occasion
after
a
hard
fought
battle
jiraiya
fled
and
took
refuge
in
a
monastery
with
a
few
trusty
vassals
to
rest
a
short
time
in
this
retreat
a
lovely
princess
named
tagoto
was
dwelling
she
had
fled
from
orochimaru
who
wished
her
for
his
bride
she
hated
to
marry
the
offspring
of
a
serpent
and
hoped
to
escape
him
she
lived
in
fear
of
him
continually
orochimaru
hearing
at
one
time
that
both
jiraiya
and
the
princess
were
at
this
place
changed
himself
into
a
serpent
and
distilling
a
large
mouthful
of
poisonous
venom
crawled
up
to
the
ceiling
in
the
room
where
jiraiya
and
his
wife
were
sleeping
and
reaching
a
spot
directly
over
them
poured
the
poisonous
venom
on
the
heads
of
his
rivals
the
fumes
of
the
prison
so
stupefied
jiraiya
followers
and
even
the
monks
that
orochimaru
instantly
changing
himself
to
a
man
profited
by
the
opportunity
to
seize
the
princess
tagoto
and
make
off
with
her
gradually
the
faithful
retainers
awoke
from
their
stupor
to
find
their
master
and
his
beloved
wife
delirious
and
near
the
point
of
death
and
the
princess
gone
what
can
we
do
to
restore
our
dear
master
to
life
this
was
the
question
each
one
asked
of
the
others
as
with
sorrowful
faces
and
weeping
eyes
they
gazed
at
the
pallid
forms
of
their
unconscious
master
and
his
consort
they
called
in
the
venerable
abbot
of
the
monastery
to
see
if
he
could
suggest
what
could
be
done
alas
said
the
aged
priest
there
is
no
medicine
in
japan
to
cure
your
lord
disease
but
in
india
there
is
an
elixir
which
is
a
sure
antidote
if
we
could
get
that
the
master
would
recover
alas
alas
and
a
chorus
of
groans
showed
that
all
hope
had
fled
for
the
mountain
in
india
where
the
elixir
was
made
lay
five
thousand
miles
from
japan
just
then
a
youth
named
rikimatsu
one
of
the
pages
of
jiraiya
arose
to
speak
he
was
but
fourteen
years
old
and
served
jiraiya
out
of
gratitude
for
he
had
rescued
his
father
from
many
dangers
and
saved
his
life
he
begged
permission
to
say
a
word
to
the
abbot
who
seeing
the
lad
eager
face
motioned
to
him
with
his
fan
to
speak
how
long
can
our
lord
live
asked
the
youth
he
will
be
dead
in
thirty
hours
answered
the
abbot
with
a
sigh
i
go
and
procure
the
medicine
and
if
our
master
is
still
living
when
i
come
back
he
will
get
well
now
rikimatsu
had
learned
magic
and
sorcery
from
the
tengus
or
elves
of
the
mountains
and
could
fly
high
in
the
air
with
incredible
swiftness
speaking
a
few
words
of
incantation
he
put
on
the
wings
of
a
tengu
mounted
a
white
cloud
and
rode
on
the
east
wind
to
india
bought
the
elixir
of
the
mountain
spirits
and
returned
to
japan
in
one
day
and
a
night
on
the
first
touch
of
the
elixir
on
the
sick
man
face
he
drew
a
deep
breath
perspiration
glistened
on
his
forehead
and
in
a
few
moments
more
he
sat
up
jiraiya
and
his
wife
both
got
well
and
the
war
broke
out
again
in
a
great
battle
was
killed
and
the
princess
rescued
for
his
prowess
and
aid
jiraiya
was
made
daimio
of
idzu
being
now
weary
of
war
and
the
hardships
of
active
life
jiraiya
was
glad
to
settle
down
to
tranquil
life
in
the
castle
and
rear
his
family
in
peace
he
spent
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
reading
the
books
of
the
sages
in
composing
verses
in
admiring
the
flowers
the
moon
and
the
landscape
and
occasionally
going
out
hawking
or
fishing
there
amid
his
children
and
children
children
he
finished
his
days
in
peace
how
the
lost
its
shell
parts
of
the
seas
of
the
japanese
archipelago
are
speckled
with
thousands
of
round
white
that
swim
a
few
feet
below
the
surface
one
can
see
the
great
steamer
go
ploughing
through
them
as
through
a
field
of
frosted
cakes
the
huge
make
a
perfect
pudding
of
thousands
of
them
as
they
are
dashed
against
the
and
whipped
into
a
froth
like
white
of
eggs
or
churned
into
a
thick
cream
by
the
propeller
blades
sometimes
the
shoals
are
of
great
breadth
and
then
it
veritably
looks
as
though
a
crockery
shop
had
been
upset
in
the
ocean
and
ten
thousand
white
had
broken
loose
around
the
bays
and
harbors
the
japanese
boys
at
play
drive
them
with
paddles
into
shoals
and
sometimes
they
poke
sticks
through
them
this
they
can
do
easily
because
the
has
no
jacket
of
shell
or
bone
like
the
lobster
nor
any
skin
like
a
fish
and
so
always
has
to
swim
naked
exposed
to
all
kinds
of
danger
sometimes
great
two
or
three
feet
in
diameter
sail
gaily
along
near
the
shore
as
proud
as
the
of
a
daimiō
and
as
brilliantly
colored
as
a
japanese
parasol
floating
all
around
their
bodies
like
the
streamers
of
a
temple
festival
or
a
court
lady
ribbons
are
their
long
tentacles
or
feelers
no
peacock
stretching
his
bannered
tail
could
make
a
finer
sight
or
look
prouder
than
these
floating
or
bladders
of
living
jelly
but
alas
for
all
things
made
of
water
let
but
a
wave
of
unusual
force
or
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
come
and
this
lump
of
pride
lies
collapsed
and
stranded
on
the
shore
like
a
pancake
upset
into
a
turnover
in
which
batter
and
crust
are
hopelessly
mixed
together
when
found
fresh
men
often
come
down
to
the
shore
and
cutting
huge
slices
of
blubber
as
transparent
as
ice
they
eat
the
solid
water
with
their
rice
in
lieu
of
drink
a
as
big
as
an
umbrella
and
weighing
as
much
as
a
big
boy
will
after
lying
a
few
hours
in
the
sun
leave
scarcely
a
trace
on
the
spot
for
their
bodies
are
little
more
than
animated
masses
of
water
at
night
however
where
a
has
stranded
the
ground
seems
to
crawl
and
emit
a
dull
fire
of
phosphorescence
which
the
japanese
call
light
but
the
once
had
a
shell
and
was
not
so
defenceless
say
the
fairy
tales
how
it
lost
it
is
thus
told
in
the
days
of
old
the
was
one
of
the
retainers
in
waiting
upon
the
queen
of
the
world
under
the
sea
at
her
palace
in
riu
gu
in
those
days
he
had
a
shell
and
as
his
head
was
hard
no
one
dared
to
insult
him
or
stick
him
with
their
horns
or
pinch
him
with
their
claws
or
scratch
him
with
their
nails
or
brush
rudely
by
him
with
their
fins
in
short
this
fish
instead
of
being
a
lump
of
jelly
as
white
and
helpless
as
a
pudding
as
we
see
him
now
was
a
lordly
fellow
that
could
get
his
back
up
and
keep
it
high
when
he
wished
to
he
waited
on
the
queen
and
right
proud
was
he
of
his
office
he
was
on
good
terms
with
the
king
dragon
which
often
allowed
him
to
play
with
his
scaly
tail
but
never
hurt
him
in
the
least
one
day
the
queen
fell
sick
and
every
hour
grew
worse
the
king
became
anxious
and
her
subjects
talked
about
nothing
else
but
her
sickness
there
was
grief
all
through
the
from
the
mermaids
on
their
beds
of
sponge
and
the
dragons
in
the
rocky
caverns
down
to
the
tiny
gudgeons
in
the
rivers
that
were
considered
no
more
than
mere
bait
the
jolly
stopped
playing
his
drums
and
guitar
folded
his
six
arms
and
hid
away
moping
in
his
hole
his
servant
the
lobster
in
vain
lighted
his
candle
at
night
and
tried
to
induce
him
to
come
out
of
his
lair
the
dolphins
and
porpoises
wept
tears
but
the
clams
oysters
and
limpets
shut
up
their
shells
and
did
not
even
wiggle
the
flounders
and
skates
lay
flat
on
the
ocean
floor
never
even
lifting
up
their
noses
the
squid
wept
a
great
deal
of
ink
and
the
nearly
melted
to
pure
water
the
tortoise
was
patient
and
offered
to
do
anything
for
the
relief
of
the
queen
but
nothing
could
be
done
the
who
professed
to
be
a
kind
of
a
doctor
offered
the
use
of
all
his
cups
to
suck
out
the
poison
if
that
were
the
trouble
but
it
was
it
was
internal
and
nothing
but
medicine
that
could
be
swallowed
would
reach
the
disease
at
last
some
one
suggested
that
the
liver
of
a
monkey
would
be
a
specific
for
the
royal
sickness
and
it
was
resolved
to
try
it
the
tortoise
who
was
the
queen
messenger
because
he
could
live
on
both
land
and
water
swim
or
crawl
was
summoned
he
was
told
to
go
upon
earth
to
a
certain
mountain
catch
a
monkey
and
bring
him
alive
to
the
off
started
the
tortoise
on
his
journey
to
the
earth
and
going
to
a
mountain
where
the
monkeys
lived
squatted
down
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
and
pretended
to
be
asleep
though
keeping
his
claws
and
tail
out
there
he
waited
patiently
well
knowing
that
curiosity
and
the
monkey
love
of
tricks
would
bring
one
within
reach
of
his
talons
pretty
soon
a
family
of
chattering
monkeys
came
running
along
among
the
branches
overhead
when
suddenly
a
young
monkey
caught
sight
of
the
sleeping
tortoise
is
it
possible
said
the
fellow
here
fun
let
tickle
the
old
fellow
back
and
pull
his
tail
all
agreed
and
forthwith
a
dozen
monkeys
joining
hand
over
hand
made
a
long
ladder
of
themselves
until
they
just
reached
the
tortoise
back
they
did
use
their
tails
for
japanese
monkeys
have
none
except
stumps
two
inches
long
however
he
who
was
to
be
the
tail
end
of
this
living
rope
when
all
was
ready
crawled
along
and
slipped
over
the
whole
line
whispering
as
he
slid
do
chatter
or
laugh
you
wake
the
old
fellow
up
now
the
monkey
expected
to
hold
on
the
living
pendulum
by
one
long
hand
and
swinging
down
with
the
other
to
pull
the
tortoise
tail
and
see
how
near
he
could
come
to
his
snout
without
being
snapped
up
for
a
monkey
well
knew
that
a
tortoise
could
neither
jump
off
its
legs
nor
climb
a
tree
once
twice
the
monkey
pendulum
swung
back
and
forth
without
touching
three
four
the
monkey
scratched
the
tortoise
back
yet
old
hard
shell
pretended
to
be
sound
asleep
five
six
the
monkey
caught
hold
of
the
tortoise
tail
and
jerked
it
hard
old
tortoise
now
moved
out
its
head
a
little
as
if
still
only
half
awake
seven
eight
this
time
the
monkey
intended
to
pull
the
tortoise
head
when
just
as
he
came
within
reach
the
tortoise
snapped
him
held
him
in
his
claws
and
as
the
monkey
pendulum
swung
back
he
lost
his
hold
in
an
instant
he
was
jerked
loose
and
fell
to
the
ground
half
stunned
frightened
at
the
loss
of
their
end
link
the
other
monkeys
of
the
chain
wound
themselves
up
like
a
windlass
over
the
branches
and
squatting
on
the
trees
set
up
a
doleful
chattering
now
says
the
tortoise
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
if
you
do
eat
you
up
get
on
my
back
and
i
carry
you
but
i
must
hold
your
paw
in
my
mouth
so
you
wo
run
away
half
frightened
to
death
the
monkey
obeyed
and
the
tortoise
trotted
off
to
the
sea
swam
to
the
spot
over
the
queen
palace
and
in
a
fillip
of
the
finger
was
down
in
the
gardens
of
riu
gu
here
let
me
say
that
according
to
another
version
of
this
story
the
monkeys
assembled
in
force
when
they
suspected
what
the
tortoise
had
come
after
and
catching
him
napping
turned
him
over
on
his
back
so
that
he
could
not
move
or
bite
then
they
took
his
under
shell
off
so
that
he
had
to
travel
back
to
riu
gu
and
get
another
one
this
last
version
however
is
uncertain
and
it
looks
like
a
piece
of
invention
to
suppose
that
the
monkeys
had
a
sufficient
medical
knowledge
to
make
them
suspicious
of
the
design
of
the
tortoise
on
the
monkey
liver
i
prefer
the
regular
account
illustration
the
monkeys
in
grief
the
queen
hearing
of
the
monkey
arrival
thanked
the
tortoise
and
commanded
her
cook
and
baker
to
feed
him
well
and
treat
him
kindly
for
the
queen
felt
really
sorry
because
he
was
to
lose
his
liver
as
for
the
monkey
he
enjoyed
himself
very
much
and
ran
around
everywhere
amusing
the
clams
oysters
and
other
pulpy
creatures
that
could
not
run
by
his
rapid
climbing
of
the
rocks
and
coral
bushes
and
by
rolling
over
the
sponge
beds
and
cutting
all
manner
of
antics
they
had
never
before
seen
anything
like
it
poor
fellow
he
suspect
what
was
to
come
all
this
time
however
the
pitied
him
in
his
heart
and
could
hardly
keep
what
he
knew
to
himself
seeing
that
the
monkey
lonely
and
homesick
was
standing
by
the
shore
of
a
pond
the
squeezed
himself
up
near
him
and
said
excuse
my
addressing
you
i
feel
very
sorry
for
you
because
you
are
to
be
put
to
death
why
said
the
monkey
what
have
i
done
oh
nothing
said
the
only
our
queen
is
sick
and
she
wants
your
liver
for
medicine
then
if
ever
any
one
saw
a
sick
looking
monkey
it
was
this
one
as
the
japanese
say
his
liver
was
smashed
he
felt
dreadfully
afraid
he
put
his
hands
over
his
eyes
and
immediately
began
to
plan
how
to
save
both
his
liver
and
his
life
after
a
while
the
rain
began
to
fall
heavily
and
the
monkey
ran
in
out
of
the
garden
and
standing
in
the
hall
of
the
queen
palace
began
to
weep
bitterly
just
then
the
tortoise
passing
by
saw
his
captive
what
are
you
crying
about
aita
aita
cried
the
monkey
when
i
left
my
home
on
the
earth
i
forgot
to
bring
my
liver
with
me
but
hung
it
upon
a
tree
and
now
it
is
raining
and
my
liver
will
decay
and
i
die
aita
aita
and
the
poor
monkey
eyes
became
red
as
a
fish
and
streamed
with
tears
when
the
tortoise
told
the
queen
courtiers
what
the
monkey
had
said
their
faces
fell
why
here
a
pretty
piece
of
business
the
monkey
is
of
no
use
without
his
liver
we
must
send
him
after
it
so
they
dispatched
the
tortoise
to
the
earth
again
the
monkey
sitting
of
his
back
they
came
to
the
mountain
again
and
the
tortoise
being
a
little
lazy
waited
at
the
foot
while
the
monkey
scampered
off
saying
he
would
be
back
in
an
hour
the
two
creatures
had
become
so
well
acquainted
that
the
old
hard
shell
fully
trusted
the
lively
little
fellow
but
instead
of
an
hour
the
tortoise
waited
till
evening
no
monkey
came
so
finding
himself
fooled
and
knowing
all
the
monkeys
would
take
the
alarm
he
waddled
back
and
told
the
queen
all
about
it
then
said
the
queen
after
reprimanding
her
messenger
for
his
silly
confidence
the
monkey
must
have
got
wind
of
our
intention
to
use
his
liver
and
what
is
more
some
one
of
my
retainers
or
servants
must
have
told
him
then
the
queen
issued
an
order
commanding
all
her
subjects
to
appear
before
the
of
the
sea
whoever
did
this
wicked
thing

now
it
happened
that
all
the
fish
and
sea
animals
of
all
sorts
that
swam

rolled
or
moved
in
any
way
appeared
before

and
his

all
except
the
then
the
queen
knew
the
was
the
guilty
one
she
ordered
the
culprit
to
be
brought
into
her
presence
then
publicly
before
all
her
retainers
and
servants
she
cried
out
you
wretch
for
your
crime
of
betraying
the
confidence
of
your
sovereign
you
shall
no
longer
remain
among
i
condemn
you
to
lose

then
she
stripped
off

shell
and
left
the
poor
entirely
naked
and
ashamed
be
off
you
hereafter
all
your
children
shall
be
soft
and
defenceless
the
poor
blushed
crimson
squeezed
himself
out
and
swam
off
out
of
sight
since
that
time

had
no
shells
lord
gives
a
concert
despite
the
loss
of
the
monkey
liver
the
queen
of
the
world
under
the
sea
after
careful
attention
and
long
rest
got
well
again
and
was
able
to
be
about
her
duties
and
govern
her
kingdom
well
the
news
of
her
recovery
created
the
wildest
joy
all
over
the
and
from
tears
and
gloom
and
silence
the
caves
echoed
with
laughter
and
the
with
music
every
one
had
on
a
white
face
drums
flutes
and
banjos
which
had
been
hung
up
on
coral
branches
or
packed
away
in
shell
boxes
were
taken
down
or
brought
out
and
right
merrily
were
they
struck
or
thrummed
with
the
ivory
plectrum
the
pretty
maids
of
the
queen
put
on
their
ivory
and
the
queen
again
listened
to
the
sweet
melodies
on
the
flat
harp
while
down
among
the
smaller
fry
of
fishy
retainers
and
the
scullions
of
the
kitchen
were
heard
the
constant
thump
of
the
the
bang
of
the
taiko
big
drum
and
the
loud
cries
of
the
dancers
as
they
struck
all
sorts
of
attitudes
with
hands
feet
and
head
no
allusion
was
openly
made
either
to
monkeys
tortoises
or
this
would
not
have
been
polite
but
the
in
a
distant
pool
in
the
garden
could
hear
the
refrain
the
rivers
of
china
run
into
the
sea
and
in
it
sinks
the
rain
now
in
the
language
of
the
people
the
words
for
river
and
skin
or
covering
and
china
and
shell
and
rain
and
jelly
are
the
same
so
the
chorus
which
was
nothing
but
a
string
of
puns
meant
the
skin
of
the
runs
to
the
sea
and
in
it
sinks
the
jelly
but
none
of
these
musical
performances
were
worthy
of
the
queen
notice
although
as
evidences
of
the
joy
of
her
subjects
they
did
very
well
a
great
many
entertainments
were
gotten
up
to
amuse
the
finny
people
but
the
queen
was
present
at
none
of
them
except
the
one
about
to
be
described
how
and
why
she
became
a
spectator
shall
also
be
told
one
night
the
queen
was
sitting
in
the
pink
arrayed
in
her
queenly
robes
for
she
was
quite
recovered
and
expected
to
walk
out
in
the
evening
everything
in
the
room
except
a
vase
of
green
and
golden
colored
and
a
plume
of
was
of
a
pink
color
then
there
was
a
pretty
rockery
made
of
a
pyramid
of
pumice
full
of
embossed
rosettes
of
living
of
scarlet
orange
grey
and
black
colors
which
were
trained
to
fold
themselves
up
like
an
umbrella
or
blossom
out
like
chrysanthemums
at
certain
hours
of
the
day
or
when
touched
behaving
just
like
four
and
sensitive
plants
all
the
furniture
and
hangings
of
the
rooms
were
pink
the
floor
was
made
of
mats
woven
from
strips
of
bound
at
the
sides
with
an
inch
border
of
pink
coral
the
ceiling
was
made
of
the
rarest
of
pink
shells
wrought
into
flowers
and
squares
the
walls
were
decorated
with
the
same
material
representing
jewels
and
tortoise
shell
patterns
in
the
or
raised
space
was
a
bouquet
of
of
richest
dyes
and
in
the
nooks
was
an
open
cabinet
holding
several
of
the
queen
own
treasures
such
as
a
tiara
which
looked
like
woven
threads
of
crystal
euplectella
and
a
toilet
box
and
writing
case
made
of
solid
pink
coral
the
gem
of
all
was
a
screen
having
eight
folds
on
which
was
depicted
the
palace
and
of
riu
gu
the
visit
of
toda
and
the
procession
of
the
queen
nobles
and
grandees
that
escorted
the
brave
archer
when
he
took
his
farewell
to
return
to
earth
the
queen
sat
on
the
glistening
sill
of
the
wide
window
looking
out
over
her
gardens
her
two
maids
sitting
at
her
feet
the
sound
of
music
wafted
through
the
coral
groves
and
crystal
grottoes
reached
her
ear
medzurashi
gozarimasu
how
wonderful
this
is
exclaimed
the
queen
half
aloud
what
strange
music
is
this
it
is
neither
guitar
nor
hand
nor
shoulder
drum
nor
singing
it
seems
to
be
a
mixture
of
all
hear
it
sounds
as
if
a
band
with
many
instruments
was
playing
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
large
choir
of
voices
true
enough
it
was
the
most
curious
music
ever
heard
in
riu
gu
for
to
tell
the
truth
the
voices
were
not
in
perfect
accord
though
all
kept
good
time
the
sound
seemed
to
issue
from
the
mansion
of
lord
the
palace
physician
the
queen
curiosity
was
roused
i
shall
go
and
see
what
it
is
said
she
as
she
rose
up
suddenly
she
recollected
and
exclaimed
o
no
it
would
not
be
proper
for
me
to
be
seen
in
public
at
this
hour
of
the
evening
and
if
it
is
in
lord
mansion
i
could
not
enter
without
a
retinue
no
it
wo
do
for
me
it
beneath
my
dignity
said
her
majesty
to
herself
as
she
went
over
to
touch
her
anemones
while
her
maids
fanned
her
seeing
their
mistress
flushed
with
excitement
and
fearing
a
relapse
curiosity
got
the
better
of
the
queenly
lady
and
off
she
started
with
only
her
two
maids
who
held
aloft
over
her
head
the
long
fans
made
of
white
shark
fins
besides
thought
she
perhaps
the
concert
is
outside
in
the
garden
if
so
i
can
look
down
and
see
from
the
great
green
rock
that
overlooks
it
and
my
lord
kai
riu
o
need
not
know
of
it
the
queen
walked
over
her
pebbled
garden
walk
avoiding
the
great
high
road
paved
with
white
coral
rock
and
taking
a
trimmed
with
the
sound
of
the
drums
and
voices
grew
louder
until
as
she
reached
the
top
of
a
green
rock
back
of
lord
garden
the
whole
performance
was
open
to
her
view
it
was
so
funny
and
the
queen
was
so
overcome
at
the
comical
sight
that
she
nearly
fell
down
and
got
the
hysterics
laughing
so
heartily
she
utterly
forgot
her
dignity
and
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
her
face
she
was
so
afraid
she
would
scream
out
that
she
nearly
choked
herself
to
death
with
her
sleeve
while
her
alarmed
maids
though
meaning
nothing
by
their
acts
but
friendly
help
slapped
her
back
to
give
her
breath
there
at
the
top
of
a
high
green
rock
all
covered
with
barnacles
on
a
huge
tuft
of
sponge
sat
lord
playing
on
three
musical
instruments
at
once
his
great
warty
speckled
head
six
feet
high
like
a
huge
bag
upside
down
was
bent
forward
to
read
the
notes
of
his
music
book
by
the
light
of
a
wax
candle
which
was
stuck
in
the
feelers
of
a
prickly
lobster
and
patiently
held
of
his
six
pulpy
arms
one
long
one
ran
down
like
the
trunk
of
an
elephant
fingering
along
the
pages
of
a
music
book
two
others
were
used
to
play
the
guitar
one
to
grasp
the
handle
and
pinch
the
strings
and
the
other
to
hold
the
ivory
stick
to
strike
the
strings
the
tsutsumi
small
double
drum
was
held
on
his
shoulder
and
neck
while
still
another
arm
curled
up
in
a
bunch
punched
it
like
a
fist
below
him
was
a
another
a
bass
drum
set
in
a
frame
and
in
his
last
leg
or
arm
was
clutched
a
heavy
which
pounded
out
tremendous
noise
if
not
music
there
the
old
fellow
sat
with
his
head
bobbing
and
all
his
six
cuppy
arms
in
motion
his
rolling
blue
eyes
ogling
the
notes
and
his
mouth
like
an
elephant
screeching
out
the
song
which
was
made
up
of
puns
on
and
though
the
real
words
made
an
entirely
different
sense
all
this
time
in
front
of
lord
sat
the
lobster
holding
up
the
light
like
the
or
black
fellows
who
hold
candles
at
the
end
of
on
the
stage
of
the
theatres
so
that
the
people
may
see
the
faces
of
the
actors
but
the
audience
or
rather
the
orchestra
was
the
funniest
part
of
all
they
could
hardly
be
called
listeners
for
they
were
all
performers
on
the
left
was
the
lusty
fish
with
its
gills
wide
open
singing
at
the
top
or
rather
at
the
bottom
of
his
throat
and
beating
time
by
flapping
his
wide
fins
just
back
of
him
was
a
little
gudgeon
silent
and
fanning
himself
with
a
blue
flat
fan
having
disgracefully
broken
down
on
a
high
note
next
behind
on
the
right
was
a
singing
alto
and
proud
of
her
slender
form
with
the
last
new
thing
in
folding
fans
held
in
her
fin
in
the
squatted
a
great
fat
frog
with
big
bulging
eyes
singing
base
and
leading
the
choir
by
flapping
his
webbed
fingers
up
and
down
with
his
frightful
cavern
of
a
mouth
wide
open
next
sat
the
stately
and
dignified
mackerel
who
was
rather
scandalized
at
the
whole
affair
and
kept
very
still
refusing
to
join
in
at
the
mackerel
right
fin
squeaked
out
the
stupid
fish
with
her
big
eye
impolitely
winking
at
the
just
bringing
in
refreshments
for
the
truth
was
she
was
thirsty
after
so
much
vocal
exercise
the
was
very
vain
and
always
played
the
coquette
around
the
hooks
of
the
fishermen
who
always
liked
to
eat
her
because
she
was
so
sweet
yet
her
flesh
was
poison
how
strange
it
is
that
men
will
angle
after
that
ugly
hussy
when
she
poisons
them
was
the
remark
of
the
just
behind
the
herring
with
one
eye
on
lord
and
one
on
the
coming
refreshments
was
the
skate
the
truth
must
be
told
that
the
entire
right
wing
of
the
orchestra
was
very
much
demoralized
by
the
smell
of
the
steaming
tea
and
eatables
just
about
to
be
served
the
suppon
tortoise
with
a
snout
like
a
bird
beak
though
he
continued
to
sing
impolitely
turned
his
head
away
from
lord
and
his
back
to
the
frog
that
acted
as
precentor
the
sucker
though
very
homely
and
bloated
with
fat
kept
on
in
the
chorus
and
pretended
not
to
notice
the
waiter
and
her
tray
and
cups
indeed
madame
sucker
thought
it
quite
vulgar
in
the
tortoise
to
be
so
eager
after
the
cakes
and
wine
in
truth
the
concert
had
been
long
and
all
were
thirsty
and
ready
for
a
bite
and
a
drink
suddenly
the
music
ceased
and
the
long
clatter
on
the
drum
announced
the
end
lord
kicked
over
his
drum
unscrewed
his
guitar
and
packed
it
away
in
his
music
box
he
then
slid
along
on
his
six
slippery
legs
to
the
refreshments
and
actually
amused
the
company
by
standing
on
his
head
and
twirling
his
six
cuppy
arms
around
at
this
miss
mackerel
was
quite
shocked
and
whispered
under
her
fan
to
the
it
is
quite
undignified
what
would
the
queen
say
if
she
saw
it
not
knowing
that
the
queen
was
looking
on
then
all
sat
down
on
their
tails
propped
upright
on
one
fin
and
produced
their
fans
to
cool
themselves
off
the
lobster
pulled
off
the
candle
stump
and
ate
it
up
wiped
his
feelers
and
joined
the
party
the
liquid
refreshments
consisted
of
sweet
and
clear
rice
beer
tea
and
water
the
solids
were
boiled
rice
radishes
and
macaroni
and
piled
up
with
flies
worms
bugs
and
all
kinds
of
bait
for
the
small
fry
the
finny
brats
that
were
to
eat
at
the
second
table
the
tea
was
poured
by
the
servants
of
lord
these
were
the
funniest
little
green
or
creatures
half
way
between
a
monkey
and
a
tortoise
with
yellow
eyes
hands
like
an
ape
hair
clipped
short
on
their
heads
eyes
like
frogs
and
a
mouth
that
stretched
from
ear
to
ear
poor
creatures
they
were
only
too
happy
to
know
that
though
they
looked
like
monkeys
their
livers
would
not
do
for
medicine
the
queen
did
not
wait
to
see
the
end
of
the
feast
but
laughing
heartily
returned
to
her
palace
and
went
to
sleep
after
helping
himself
with
all
the
cups
of
his
arms
out
of
the
tub
of
boiled
rice
until
miss
mackerel
made
up
her
mind
that
he
was
an
rice
glutton
and
drinking
like
a
shoal
of
fishes
lord
went
home
coiled
himself
up
into
a
ball
and
fell
asleep
he
had
a
headache
next
morning
yorimasa
the
brave
archer
genzan
yorimasa
was
a
brave
warrior
and
a
very
useful
man
who
lived
more
than
eight
thousand
moons
ago
on
account
of
his
valor
and
skill
in
the
use
of
the
bow
he
was
called
to
kioto
and
promoted
to
be
chief
guard
of
the
imperial
palace
at
that
time
the
emperor
narahito
could
not
sleep
at
night
because
his
rest
was
disturbed
by
a
frightful
beast
which
scared
away
even
the
sentinels
in
armor
who
stood
on
guard
this
dreadful
beast
had
the
wings
of
a
bird
the
body
and
claws
of
a
tiger
the
head
of
a
monkey
a
serpent
tail
and
the
crackling
scales
of
a
dragon
it
came
after
night
upon
the
roof
of
the
palace
and
howled
and
scratched
so
dreadfully
that
the
poor
mikado
losing
all
rest
grew
weak
and
thin
none
of
the
guards
dare
face
it
in
fight
and
none
had
skill
enough
to
hit
it
with
an
arrow
in
the
dark
though
several
of
the
imperial
corps
of
archers
had
tried
again
and
again
when
yorimasa
received
his
appointment
he
strung
his
bow
carefully
and
carefully
honing
his
arrows
stored
his
quiver
and
resolved
to
mount
guard
that
night
with
his
favorite
retainer
it
chanced
to
be
a
stormy
night
the
lightning
was
very
vivid
and
kaminari
the
was
beating
all
his
drums
the
wind
swirled
round
frightfully
as
though
fuden
the
was
emptying
all
his
bags
toward
midnight
the
falcon
eye
of
yorimasa
saw
during
a
flash
of
lightning
the
awful
beast
sitting
on
the
devil
tile
at
the
tip
of
the
on
the
end
of
the
roof
he
bade
his
retainer
have
a
torch
of
straw
and
twigs
ready
to
light
at
a
moment
notice
to
loosen
his
blade
and
wet
its
while
he
fitted
the
notch
of
his
best
arrow
into
the
silk
cord
of
his
bow
keeping
his
eyes
strained
he
pretty
soon
saw
the
glare
now
of
one
eye
now
two
eyes
as
the
beast
with
swaying
head
crept
along
the
great
roof
to
the
place
on
the
eaves
directly
under
the
mikado
there
it
stopped
this
was
yorimasa
opportunity
aiming
about
a
foot
to
the
right
of
where
he
saw
the
eye
glare
he
drew
his
shaft
clear
back
to
his
shoulder
and
let
fly
a
dull
thud
a
frightful
howl
a
heavy
bump
on
the
ground
and
the
writhing
of
some
creature
among
the
pebbles
told
in
a
few
seconds
time
that
the
shaft
had
struck
flesh
the
next
instant
yorimasa
retainer
rushed
out
with
blazing
torch
and
joined
battle
with
his
dirk
seizing
the
beast
by
the
neck
he
quickly
despatched
him
by
cutting
his
throat
then
they
flayed
the
monster
and
the
next
morning
the
hide
was
shown
to
his
majesty
all
congratulated
yorimasa
on
his
valor
and
marksmanship
many
young
men
sons
of
nobles
and
warriors
begged
to
become
his
pupils
in
archery
the
mikado
ordered
a
noble
of
very
high
rank
to
present
to
yorimasa
a
famous
sword
named
king
of
wild
boars
and
to
give
him
a
lovely
maid
of
honor
named
ayami
to
wife
and
so
the
brave
and
the
fair
were
married
and
to
this
day
the
fame
of
yorimasa
is
like
the
bamboo
and
pine
fragrant
green
and
illustration
yorimasa
and
the
watanabe
cuts
off
the
oni
arm
when
the
capital
of
japan
was
the
city
of
kioto
and
the
mikado
dwelt
in
it
with
all
his
court
there
lived
a
brave
captain
of
the
guard
named
yorimitsu
who
belonged
to
the
famous
minamoto
family
he
was
also
called
raiko
and
by
this
name
he
is
best
known
to
all
the
boys
and
girls
in
great
japan
under
captain
raiko
were
three
brave
guardsmen
one
of
whom
was
named
watanabé
tsuna
the
duty
of
these
was
to
watch
at
the
gates
leading
to
the
palace
it
had
come
to
pass
that
the
blossom
capital
had
fallen
in
a
dreadful
condition
because
the
guards
at
the
other
gates
had
been
neglected
thieves
were
numerous
and
murders
were
frequent
so
that
every
one
in
the
city
was
afraid
to
go
out
into
the
streets
at
night
worse
than
all
else
was
the
report
that
oni
or
imps
were
prowling
around
in
the
dark
to
seize
people
by
the
hair
of
the
head
then
they
would
drag
them
away
to
the
mountains
tear
the
flesh
off
their
bones
and
eat
them
up
the
worst
place
in
the
city
to
which
the
horned
imps
came
oftenest
was
at
the
gate
called
the
to
this
post
of
danger
raiko
sent
tsuna
the
bravest
of
his
guards
it
was
on
a
dark
rainy
and
dismal
night
that
tsuna
started
to
stand
sentinel
at
the
gate
his
trusty
helmet
was
knotted
over
his
chin
and
all
the
pieces
of
his
armor
were
well
laced
up
his
sandals
were
girt
tight
to
his
feet
and
in
his
belt
was
thrust
the
trusty
sword
freshly
ground
until
its
edge
was
like
a
razor
and
with
it
the
owner
could
cut
asunder
a
hair
floating
in
the
air
arriving
at
the
red
pillar
of
the
gate
tsuna
paced
up
and
down
the
stone
way
with
eyes
and
ears
wide
open
the
wind
was
blowing
frightfully
the
storm
howled
and
the
rain
fell
in
such
torrents
that
soon
the
cords
of
tsuna
armor
and
his
dress
were
soaked
through
the
great
bronze
bell
of
the
temples
on
the
hills
boomed
out
the
hours
one
after
another
until
a
single
stroke
told
tsuna
it
was
the
hour
of
the
rat
midnight
two
hours
passed
and
the
hour
of
the
bull
sounded
still
tsuna
was
wide
awake
the
storm
had
lulled
but
it
was
darker
than
ever
the
hour
of
the
tiger
rung
out
and
the
soft
mellow
notes
of
the
temple
bell
died
away
like
a
lullaby
wooing
one
to
sleep
spite
of
will
and
vow
the
warrior
almost
without
knowing
it
grew
sleepy
and
fell
into
a
doze
he
started
and
woke
up
he
shook
himself
jingled
his
armor
pinched
himself
and
even
pulled
out
his
little
knife
from
the
wooden
scabbard
of
his
dirk
and
pricked
his
leg
with
the
point
of
it
to
keep
awake
but
all
in
vain
unconsciously
overcome
he
leaned
against
the
and
fell
asleep
this
was
just
what
the
imp
wanted
all
the
time
he
had
been
squatting
on
the
at
the
top
of
the
gate
waiting
his
opportunity
he
now
slid
down
as
softly
as
a
monkey
and
with
his
claws
grabbed
tsuna
by
the
helmet
and
began
to
drag
him
into
the
air
in
an
instant
tsuna
was
awake
seizing
the
hairy
wrist
of
the
imp
with
his
left
hand
with
his
right
he
drew
his
sword
swept
it
round
his
head
and
cut
off
the
demon
arm
the
oni
frightened
and
howling
with
pain
leaped
up
the
post
and
disappeared
in
the
clouds
tsuna
waited
with
drawn
sword
in
hand
lest
the
oni
might
come
again
but
in
a
few
hours
morning
dawned
the
sun
rose
on
the
pagodas
and
gardens
and
temples
of
the
capitol
and
the
circle
of
flowery
hills
everything
was
beautiful
and
bright
tsuna
returned
to
report
to
his
captain
carrying
the
oni
arm
in
triumph
raiko
examined
it
and
loudly
praised
tsuna
for
his
bravery
and
rewarded
him
with
a
silken
sash
now
it
is
said
that
if
an
oni
arm
be
cut
off
it
can
not
be
made
to
unite
with
the
body
again
if
kept
apart
for
a
week
so
raiko
warned
tsuna
to
lock
it
up
and
watch
it
night
and
day
lest
it
be
stolen
from
him
so
tsuna
went
to
the
who
made
idols
of
buddha
mortars
for
pounding
rice
and
coffers
for
burying
money
in
to
be
hidden
away
in
the
ground
and
bought
a
strong
box
cut
out
of
the
solid
stone
it
had
a
heavy
lid
on
it
which
slid
in
a
groove
and
came
out
only
by
touching
a
secret
spring
then
setting
it
in
his
bed
chamber
he
guarded
it
day
and
night
keeping
the
gate
and
all
his
doors
locked
he
allowed
no
one
who
was
a
stranger
to
look
at
the
trophy
six
days
passed
by
and
tsuna
began
to
think
his
prize
was
sure
for
were
not
all
his
doors
tight
shut
so
he
set
the
box
out
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
twisting
some
fringe
in
token
of
sure
victory
and
rejoicing
he
sat
down
in
ease
before
it
he
took
off
his
armor
and
put
on
his
court
robes
during
the
evening
but
rather
late
there
was
a
feeble
knock
like
that
of
an
old
woman
at
the
gate
outside
tsuna
cried
out
who
there
the
squeaky
voice
of
his
aunt
as
it
seemed
who
was
a
very
old
woman
replied
me
i
want
to
see
my
nephew
to
praise
him
for
his
bravery
in
cutting
the
oni
arm
off
so
tsuna
let
her
in
and
carefully
locking
the
door
behind
her
helped
the
old
crone
into
the
room
where
she
sat
down
on
the
mats
in
front
of
the
box
and
very
close
to
it
then
she
grew
very
talkative
and
praised
her
nephew
exploit
until
tsuna
felt
very
proud
all
the
time
the
old
woman
left
shoulder
was
covered
with
her
dress
while
her
right
hand
was
out
then
she
begged
earnestly
to
be
allowed
to
see
the
limb
tsuna
at
first
politely
refused
but
she
urged
until
yielding
affectionately
he
slid
back
the
stone
lid
just
a
little
this
is
my
arm
cried
the
old
hag
turning
into
an
oni
and
dragging
out
the
arm
she
flew
up
to
the
ceiling
and
was
out
of
the
through
the
roof
in
a
twinkling
tsuna
rushed
out
of
the
house
to
shoot
her
with
an
arrow
but
he
saw
only
a
demon
far
off
in
the
clouds
grinning
horribly
he
noted
carefully
however
that
the
direction
of
the
imps
flight
was
to
the
a
council
was
now
held
by
raiko
band
and
it
was
decided
that
the
of
the
demons
must
be
in
the
mountains
of
oyé
in
the
province
of
tango
it
was
resolved
to
hunt
out
and
destroy
the
imps
watanabe
kills
the
great
spider
during
the
time
in
which
watanabé
was
forming
his
plan
to
destroy
the
onis
that
lurked
in
the
oyé
mountains
the
brave
raiko
fell
sick
and
daily
grew
weaker
and
paler
when
the
demons
found
this
out
they
sent
the
imp
called
mitsumé
kozo
to
plague
him
this
imp
which
had
a
snout
like
a
hog
three
monstrous
blue
eyes
and
a
mouth
full
of
tusks
was
glad
that
the
brave
soldier
could
no
longer
fight
the
onis
he
would
approach
the
sick
man
in
his
chamber
leer
horribly
at
him
loll
out
his
tongue
and
pull
down
the
lids
of
his
eyes
with
his
hairy
fingers
until
the
sight
sickened
raiko
more
and
more
but
raiko
well
or
ill
always
slept
with
his
trusty
sword
under
his
pillow
and
pretending
to
be
greatly
afraid
and
to
cower
under
the
the
kozo
grew
bolder
and
bolder
when
the
imp
was
near
the
bed
raiko
drew
his
blade
and
cut
the
oni
across
his
huge
double
nose
this
made
the
demon
howl
and
he
ran
away
leaving
tracks
of
blood
when
tsuna
and
his
band
heard
of
their
brave
master
exploit
they
came
to
congratulate
him
and
offered
to
hunt
out
the
demon
and
destroy
him
they
followed
the
red
drops
until
they
came
to
a
cavern
in
the
mountains
entering
this
they
saw
in
the
gloom
a
spider
six
feet
high
with
legs
as
long
as
a
and
as
thick
as
a
daikon
radish
two
great
yellow
eyes
glared
at
them
like
lamps
they
noticed
a
great
gaping
wound
as
if
done
by
a
on
his
snout
it
was
a
horrible
nasty
hairy
thing
to
fight
with
swords
since
to
get
near
enough
they
would
be
in
danger
of
the
creature
claws
so
tsuna
went
and
chopped
down
a
tree
as
thick
as
a
man
leg
leaving
the
roots
on
while
his
comrades
prepared
a
rope
to
tie
up
the
monster
like
a
fly
in
a
web
then
with
a
loud
yell
tsuna
rushed
at
the
spider
felled
him
with
a
blow
and
held
him
down
with
the
tree
and
roots
so
he
could
not
bite
or
use
his
claws
seeing
this
his
comrades
rushed
in
and
bound
the
monster
legs
tight
to
his
body
so
that
he
could
not
move
drawing
their
swords
they
passed
them
through
his
body
and
finished
him
returning
in
triumph
to
the
city
they
found
their
dear
captain
recovered
from
his
illness
raiko
thanked
his
brave
warriors
for
their
exploits
made
a
feast
for
them
and
gave
them
many
presents
at
this
feast
captain
raiko
told
them
that
he
had
received
orders
from
the
mikado
to
march
against
the
den
in
tango
slaughter
them
all
and
rescue
the
prisoners
he
should
find
there
then
he
showed
them
his
commission
written
in
large
letters
i
command
you
raiko
to
chastise
the
onis
he
also
allowed
them
to
examine
the
gold
brocade
bag
in
which
it
was
kept
and
which
one
of
the
fair
ladies
of
the
court
had
made
for
him
with
her
own
tapering
fingers
at
this
time
many
families
in
kioto
were
grieving
over
the
loss
of
their
children
and
even
while
tsuna
had
been
away
several
lovely
damsels
had
been
seized
and
taken
to
the
demon
den
lest
the
onis
might
hear
of
their
coming
and
escape
the
four
trusty
men
disguised
themselves
as
komuso
or
wandering
priests
of
the
mountains
they
put
on
over
their
helmets
huge
hats
like
made
of
straw
woven
so
tightly
that
no
one
could
see
their
faces
they
covered
their
armor
with
very
cheap
and
common
clothes
and
then
after
worshipping
at
the
shrines
began
their
march
raiko
and
the
doji
quite
pathless
were
the
desolate
mountains
of
tango
for
no
one
ever
went
into
them
except
once
in
a
while
a
poor
woodcutter
or
yet
raiko
and
his
men
set
out
with
stout
hearts
there
were
no
bridges
over
the
streams
and
frightful
precipices
abounded
once
they
had
to
stop
and
build
a
bridge
by
felling
a
tree
and
walking
across
it
over
a
dangerous
chasm
once
they
came
to
a
steep
rock
to
descend
which
they
must
make
a
ladder
of
creeping
vines
at
last
they
reached
a
dense
grove
at
the
top
of
a
cliff
far
up
to
the
clouds
which
seemed
as
if
it
might
contain
the
demon
castle
approaching
they
found
a
pretty
maiden
washing
some
clothes
which
had
spots
of
blood
on
them
they
said
to
her
sister
miss
why
are
you
here
and
what
are
you
doing
ah
said
she
with
a
deep
sigh
you
must
not
come
here
this
is
the
haunt
of
demons
they
eat
human
flesh
and
they
will
eat
yours
look
there
said
she
pointing
to
a
pile
of
white
bones
of
men
women
and
children
you
must
go
down
the
mountain
as
quickly
as
you
came
saying
this
she
burst
into
tears
but
instead
of
being
frightened
or
sorrowful
the
brave
fellows
nearly
danced
for
joy
we
have
come
here
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
the
demons
by
the
mikado
orders
said
raiko
patting
his
breast
where
inside
his
dress
in
the
damask
bag
was
the
imperial
order
at
this
the
maiden
dried
her
tears
and
smiled
so
sweetly
that
heart
was
touched
by
her
beauty
but
how
came
you
to
live
among
these
cannibal
demons
asked
raiko
she
blushed
deeply
as
she
replied
sadly
although
they
eat
men
and
old
women
they
keep
the
young
maidens
to
wait
on
them
it
a
great
pity
said
raiko
but
we
shall
now
avenge
our
fellow
subjects
of
the
mikado
as
well
as
your
shame
and
cruel
treatment
if
you
will
show
us
the
way
up
the
cliff
to
the
den
they
began
to
climb
the
hill
but
they
had
not
gone
far
before
they
met
a
young
oni
who
was
a
cook
in
the
great
dōji
kitchen
he
was
carrying
a
human
limb
for
his
master
lunch
they
gnashed
their
teeth
silently
and
clutched
their
swords
under
their
coats
yet
they
courteously
saluted
the
and
asked
for
an
interview
with
the
chief
the
demon
smiled
in
his
sleeve
thinking
what
a
fine
dinner
his
master
would
make
of
the
four
men
a
few
feet
forward
and
a
turn
in
the
path
brought
them
to
the
front
of
the
demon
castle
among
tall
and
mighty
boulders
of
rock
which
loomed
up
to
the
clouds
there
was
an
opening
in
the
dense
groves
thickly
covered
with
vines
and
mosses
like
an
arbor
from
this
point
the
view
over
the
plains
below
commanded
a
space
of
hundreds
of
miles
in
the
distance
the
red
pagodas
white
and
castle
towers
of
kioto
were
visible
inside
the
cave
was
a
banqueting
hall
large
enough
to
seat
one
hundred
persons
the
floor
was
neatly
covered
with
new
clean
mats
of
on
which
tables
silken
cushions
bottles
and
many
other
articles
of
comfort
lay
about
the
stone
walls
were
richly
decorated
with
curtains
and
hangings
of
fine
silken
stuffs
at
the
end
of
the
long
hall
on
a
raised
dais
our
heroes
presently
observed
as
a
curtain
was
lifted
the
chief
demon
dōji
of
august
yet
frightful
appearance
he
was
seated
on
a
heap
of
luxurious
cushions
made
of
blue
and
crimson
crape
stuffed
with
swan
down
he
was
leaning
on
a
golden
his
body
was
quite
red
and
he
was
round
and
fat
like
a
baby
grown
up
he
had
very
black
hair
cut
like
a
small
boy
and
on
the
top
of
his
head
just
peeping
through
the
hair
were
two
very
short
horns
around
him
were
a
score
of
lovely
maidens
the
fairest
of
kioto
on
whose
beautiful
faces
was
stamped
the
misery
they
dared
not
fully
show
yet
could
not
entirely
conceal
along
the
wall
other
demons
sat
or
lay
at
full
length
each
one
with
his
handmaid
seated
beside
him
to
wait
on
him
and
pour
out
his
wine
all
of
them
were
of
horrible
aspect
which
only
made
the
beauty
of
the
maidens
more
conspicuous
seeing
our
heroes
walk
in
the
hall
led
by
the
cook
each
one
of
the
demons
was
as
happy
as
a
spider
when
in
his
lurking
hole
he
feels
the
jerk
on
his
that
tells
him
a
fly
is
caught
all
of
them
at
once
poured
out
a
fresh
saucer
of
saké
and
drank
it
down
raiko
and
his
men
separated
and
began
talking
freely
with
the
demons
until
the
partitions
at
one
corner
were
slid
aside
and
a
troop
of
little
demons
who
were
entered
they
brought
in
a
host
of
dishes
and
the
onis
fell
to
and
ate
the
noise
of
their
jaws
sounded
like
the
pounding
of
a
rice
mill
our
heroes
were
nearly
sickened
at
the
repast
for
it
consisted
chiefly
of
human
flesh
while
the
were
made
of
empty
human
skulls
however
they
laughed
and
talked
and
excused
themselves
from
eating
saying
they
had
just
lunched
as
the
demons
drank
more
and
more
they
grew
lively
laughed
till
the
cave
echoed
and
sang
uproarious
songs
every
time
they
grinned
they
showed
their
terrible
tusks
and
teeth
like
fangs
all
of
them
had
horns
though
most
of
these
were
very
short
the
dōji
became
especially
hilarious
and
drank
the
health
of
every
one
of
his
four
guests
in
a
skull
full
of
wine
to
supply
him
there
was
a
tub
full
of
saké
at
hand
and
his
usual
was
a
dish
which
seemed
to
tsuma
to
be
as
large
as
a
full
moon
raiko
now
offered
to
return
the
courtesies
shown
them
by
dancing
the
kioto
dance
for
which
he
was
famous
stepping
out
into
the
centre
of
the
hall
with
his
fan
in
one
hand
he
danced
gracefully
and
with
such
wonderful
ease
that
the
onis
screamed
with
delight
and
clapped
their
hands
in
applause
saying
they
had
never
seen
anything
to
equal
it
even
the
maidens
lost
in
admiration
of
the
polished
courtier
forgot
their
sorrow
and
felt
as
happy
for
the
time
as
though
they
were
at
home
dancing
the
dance
finished
raiko
took
from
his
bosom
a
bottle
of
saké
and
offered
it
to
the
chief
demon
as
a
gift
saying
it
was
the
best
wine
of
sakai
the
delighted
dōji
drank
and
gave
a
sip
to
each
of
his
lords
saying
this
is
the
best
liquor
i
ever
tasted
you
must
drink
the
health
of
our
friends
in
it
now
raiko
had
bought
at
the
most
skillful
druggists
in
the
capital
a
powerful
sleeping
potion
and
mixed
it
with
the
wine
which
made
it
taste
very
sweet
in
a
few
minutes
all
the
demons
had
dropped
off
asleep
and
their
snores
sounded
like
the
rolling
thunder
of
the
mountains
then
raiko
rose
up
and
gave
the
signal
to
his
comrades
whispering
to
the
maidens
to
leave
the
room
quietly
they
drew
their
swords
and
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
cut
the
throats
of
the
demons
no
sound
was
heard
but
the
gurgling
of
blood
that
ran
out
in
floods
on
the
floor
the
dōji
lying
like
a
lion
on
his
cushions
was
still
sleeping
the
snores
issuing
out
of
his
nose
like
thunder
from
a
cloud
the
four
warriors
approached
him
and
like
loyal
vassals
as
they
were
they
first
turned
their
faces
towards
kioto
reverenced
the
mikado
and
prayed
for
the
blessing
of
the
gods
who
made
japan
raiko
then
drew
near
and
measuring
the
width
of
the
doji
neck
with
his
sword
found
that
it
would
be
short
suddenly
the
blade
lengthened
of
itself
then
lifting
his
weapon
he
smote
with
all
his
might
and
cut
the
neck
clean
through
in
an
instant
the
bloody
head
flew
up
in
the
air
gnashing
its
teeth
and
rolling
its
yellow
eyes
while
the
horns
sprouted
out
to
a
horrible
length
the
jaws
opening
and
shutting
like
the
edges
of
an
earthquake
fissure
it
flew
up
and
whirled
round
the
room
seven
times
then
with
a
rush
it
flew
at
raiko
head
and
bit
through
the
straw
hat
and
into
the
iron
helmet
inside
but
this
final
effort
exhausted
its
strength
motions
ceased
and
it
fell
heavily
to
the
floor
anxiously
the
comrades
helped
their
fallen
leader
to
rise
and
examined
his
head
but
he
was
unhurt
not
a
scratch
was
on
him
then
the
heroes
congratulated
each
other
and
after
despatching
the
smaller
demons
brought
out
all
the
treasure
and
divided
it
equally
then
they
set
the
castle
on
fire
and
buried
the
bones
of
the
victims
setting
up
a
stone
to
mark
the
spot
all
the
maidens
and
captives
were
assembled
together
and
in
great
state
and
pomp
they
returned
to
kioto
the
virgins
were
restored
to
their
parents
and
many
a
desolate
home
was
made
joyful
and
many
mourning
garments
taken
off
raiko
was
honored
by
the
mikado
in
being
made
a
kugé
court
noble
and
was
appointed
chief
of
the
entire
garrison
of
kiotō
then
all
the
people
were
grateful
for
his
valor
the
sazaye
and
the
tai
sazayé
is
a
which
is
very
proud
of
its
shell
this
is
high
full
of
points
like
towers
and
thick
like
a
castle
wall
when
feeding
enjoying
itself
or
moving
around
its
long
neck
and
body
are
stretched
out
before
it
armed
with
its
hard
operculum
which
is
like
an
iron
shield
or
the
end
of
a
battering
ram
the
operculum
fits
the
entrance
to
its
shell
like
a
trap
door
as
soon
as
any
danger
is
near
it
pulls
in
its
head
and
slams
itself
shut
with
a
loud
noise
on
account
of
the
hardness
and
thickness
of
his
shell
the
sazayé
is
the
envy
of
the
fishes
that
covet
his
security
but
on
the
other
hand
the
sazayé
though
a
slow
moving
creature
is
apt
to
be
too
proud
of
his
defence
and
trust
too
much
to
his
fancied
security
one
day
a
tai
red
fish
and
a
herring
were
looking
at
the
strong
shell
of
the
sazayé
and
becoming
quite
envious
the
tai
said
what
a
mighty
strong
castle
you
do
live
in
sazayé
when
you
once
shut
up
your
shell
no
one
need
even
try
to
touch
you
you
are
to
be
envied
sir
the
sazayé
was
tickled
at
the
flattery
but
pretending
to
be
very
humble
shook
his
head
and
said
it
is
very
kind
in
you
my
lords
to
say
so
but
my
little
hut
is
nothing
but
a
shell
yet
i
must
say
that
when
i
lock
my
door
i
do
not
feel
any
anxiety
and
i
really
pity
you
poor
fellows
who
have
no
shell
at
all
he
had
hardly
got
the
last
word
out
of
his
grisly
throat
when
suddenly
there
was
a
great
splash
and
away
darted
the
tai
and
herring
never
resting
their
fins
or
tails
a
moment
till
safe
out
of
danger
the
sazayé
drew
in
his
flap
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
keeping
as
quiet
as
possible
wondered
what
the
noise
was
was
it
a
stone
or
a
net
or
a
he
wondered
if
the
tai
and
herring
were
caught
surely
they
must
be
thought
he
however
i
safe
thanks
to
my
castle
shell
he
muttered
so
drawing
his
trap
tighter
he
took
a
long
nap
when
he
woke
up
quite
refreshed
he
cautiously
loosened
his
trap
and
peeped
out
how
strange
every
thing
looks
am
i
dreaming
said
he
as
he
saw
piles
of
fish
clams
prawns
and
lobsters
lying
on
a
board
all
around
him
ugh
what
is
that
clapping
himself
shut
as
a
great
and
dog
poked
his
muzzle
near
him
poor
there
he
lay
in

slip

on
his
back

he
was

proud

the
on
finding

he
would
charge
his

making
out

presented
it

jingled

to
these
questions
the
japanese
legend
gives
answer
when
heaven
and
earth
were
first
created
there
was
neither
lake
of
biwa
nor
mountain
of
fuji
suruga
and
omi
were
both
plains
even
for
long
after
men
inhabited
japan
and
the
mikados
had
ruled
for
centuries
there
was
neither
earth
so
nigh
to
heaven
nor
water
so
close
to
the
as
the
peaks
of
fuji
and
the
bottom
of
biwa
men
drove
the
plow
and
planted
the
rice
over
the
very
spot
where
crater
and
deepest
depth
now
are
but
one
night
in
the
ancient
times
there
was
a
terrible
earthquake
all
the
world
shook
the
clouds
lowered
to
the
earth
floods
of
water
poured
from
the
sky
and
a
sound
like
the
fighting
of
a
myriad
of
dragons
filled
the
air
in
the
morning
all
was
serene
and
calm
the
sky
was
blue
the
earth
was
as
bright
and
all
was
as
as
when
the
sun
goddess
first
came
out
from
her
hiding
in
the
cave
the
people
of
omi
awoke
scarce
expecting
to
find
either
earth
or
heaven
when
lo
they
looked
on
what
had
yesterday
been
tilled
land
or
barren
moor
and
there
was
a
great
sheet
of
blue
was
it
sky
had
a
sheet
of
the
blue
field
of
heaven
fallen
down
was
it
the
ocean
they
came
near
it
tasted
it
it
was
fresh
and
sweet
as
a
they
looked
at
it
from
the
and
seeing
its
outline
called
it
the
lake
of
the
lute
others
proud
of
their
new
possession
named
it
the
lake
of
omi
greater
still
was
the
surprise
of
the
suruga
people
the
sailors
far
out
at
sea
rubbed
their
eyes
and
wondered
at
the
strange
shape
of
the
towering
white
cloud
was
it
the
iwakura
the
eternal
throne
of
heaven
come
down
to
rest
on
earth
out
of
the
many
piled
white
clouds
of
heaven
some
thought
they
had
lost
their
reckoning
but
were
assured
when
they
recognized
familiar
landmarks
on
shore
many
a
cottager
woke
up
to
find
his
house
which
lay
in
a
valley
the
day
before
was
now
far
up
on
the
slope
with
the
distant
villages
and
the
sea
visible
while
far
far
above
shone
the
snowy
head
of
a
mountain
whose
crown
lay
in
the
blue
sky
at
night
the
edges
of
the
peak
like
white
fingers
seemed
to
pluck
the
stars
from
the
milky
way
what
shall
we
call
this
child
of
the
gods
said
the
people
and
various
names
were
proposed
there
is
no
other
mountain
so
beautiful
in
all
the
earth
there
not
its
equal
anywhere
therefore
call
it
fuji
no
two
such
the
peerless
the
matchless
mountain
said
one
it
is
so
tall
so
comely
so
grand
call
it
fuji
rich
scholar
the
lordly
mountain
said
another
call
it
fuji
never
dying
the
immortal
mountain
said
a
third
call
it
after
the
festal
flower
of
joy
fuji
wistaria
said
another
as
he
decked
the
peak
of
his
hat
with
the
drooping
clusters
of
the
tender
blue
blossom
it
looks
blue
and
purple
in
the
distance
just
like
the
fuji
flower
various
as
the
meanings
of
the
name
were
they
sounded
all
alike
to
the
ear
so
without
any
quarreling
all
agreed
to
call
it
fuji
and
each
to
choose
his
own
meaning
to
this
day
though
many
a
learned
dispute
and
the
scratching
of
the
written
character
on
the
sand
with
walking
stick
or
on
paper
with
pencil
or
on
the
palm
of
the
hand
with
forefinger
takes
place
all
pronounce
the
name
alike
as
they
rave
on
the
beauties
of
fuji
yama
so
went
forth
into
the
countries
bounding
the
four
seas
the
belief
that
there
was
a
white
mountain
of
perfect
form
in
japan
and
that
whoever
ascended
it
would
live
long
and
even
attain
immortality
and
that
somewhere
on
the
mountain
was
hidden
the
elixir
of
immortality
which
if
any
one
drank
he
would
live
forever
now
in
one
of
the
kingdoms
of
china
there
lived
a
rich
old
king
who
had
abundance
of
treasures
health
and
many
children
but
he
did
not
wish
to
die
and
hence
spent
his
days
in
studying
the
lore
and
arts
of
the
alchemists
who
believed
they
would
finally
attain
to
the
transmutation
of
lead
into
gold
find
the
universal
solvent
of
all
things
the
philosophers
stone
the
elixir
of
life
and
all
the
wondrous
secrets
which
men
in
europe
long
afterward
labored
to
discover
among
the
king
sages
was
one
old
man
of
mighty
wisdom
who
had
heard
of
the
immortal
mountain
of
japan
and
learning
of
the
manner
of
its
appearance
concluded
that
the
japan
archipelago
contained
the
fortunate
isles
and
in
it
was
the
true
elixir
of
life
he
divulged
his
secret
to
the
king
and
advised
him
to
make
the
journey
to
the
land
of
the
rising
sun
overjoyed
at
the
good
news
and
the
faithfulness
of
his
loyal
sage
the
king
loaded
him
with
gifts
and
honors
he
selected
five
hundred
of
the
most
beauteous
youths
and
virgins
of
his
kingdom
and
fitting
out
a
fleet
sailed
away
to
the
happy
isles
of
the
east
coasting
along
the
shore
until
they
recognized
the
glorious
form
of
the
mountain
they
landed
and
began
the
ascent
alas
for
the
poor
king
the
rough
sea
and
severe
storms
had
worn
on
his
aged
frame
and
the
fatigues
of
the
ascent
were
so
great
that
before
reaching
the
top
he
fainted
away
and
before
the
head
of
the
procession
had
set
foot
on
the
crater
edge
the
monarch
was
dead
sadly
they
gave
up
the
search
for
the
elixir
of
life
and
descending
the
mountain
buried
their
master
in
the
province
of
kii
then
in
their
exuberance
of
youth
and
joy
thinking
little
of
the
far
future
and
wishing
to
enjoy
the
present
they
separated
in
couples
married
and
disposing
of
their
ship
and
cargo
settled
in
the
country
and
colonized
the
eastern
part
of
japan
long
afterward
when
buddhist
believers
came
to
japan
one
of
them
climbing
fuji
noticed
that
around
its
sunken
crater
were
eight
peaks
like
the
petals
of
their
sacred
lotus
flower
thus
it
seemed
to
them
great
buddha
had
honored
japan
by
bestowing
the
sacred
symbol
of
nirvana
or
heaven
on
the
proudest
and
highest
part
of
japan
so
they
also
named
it
fuji
the
sacred
mountain
and
to
this
day
all
the
world
calls
this
sacred
mountain
fuji
or
fusi
yama
while
the
japanese
people
believe
that
the
earth
which
sunk
in
omi
is
the
same
which
piled
to
the
clouds
is
the
lordly
mountain
of
suruga
the
waterfall
of
yoro
or
the
fountain
of
youth
long
long
ago
when
the
oldest
stork
was
young
there
lived
an
aged
woodcutter
and
his
son
on
the
slopes
of
the
mountain
tagi
in
the
province
of
mino
they
gained
a
frugal
livelihood
by
cutting
brushwood
on
the
and
carrying
it
in
bundles
on
their
back
to
sell
in
the
nearest
market
town
for
they
were
too
poor
to
own
an
ox
with
the
money
thus
received
they
bought
rice
and
radishes
their
daily
food
only
once
or
twice
a
year
at
new
year
and
on
the
mikado
birthday
could
they
afford
to
treat
themselves
to
a
mess
of
or
fresh
fish
yet
the
old
man
was
very
fond
of
and
every
week
bought
a
gourd
full
to
keep
his
old
blood
warm
as
the
years
rolled
on
the
aged
father
limbs
became
so
stiff
that
he
was
unable
any
longer
to
climb
the
mountains
so
his
son
now
grown
to
be
a
sturdy
man
cut
nearly
double
the
quantity
of
wood
and
thus
kept
the
family
larder
full
the
old
man
was
so
proud
of
his
son
that
he
daily
stood
at
sunset
in
front
of
his
rustic
gate
to
welcome
him
back
and
to
see
the
old
daddy
and
the
young
stripling
remove
their
headkerchiefs
and
bow
with
hands
on
knees
in
polite
fashion
bending
their
backs
and
sucking
in
their
breath
out
of
respect
to
each
other
and
to
hear
them
inquiring
after
one
another
health
showering
mutual
compliments
all
the
time
one
would
have
thought
they
had
not
seen
each
other
for
eight
years
instead
of
eight
hours
one
winter
the
snow
fell
long
and
thick
until
all
the
ground
in
field
and
forest
was
covered
several
feet
over
the
bamboo
branches
bent
with
their
weight
of
white
the
pine
boughs
broke
under
their
load
and
even
the
stone
idols
along
the
wayside
were
covered
up
at
first
even
with
the
hardest
work
the
young
woodcutter
could
scarcely
get
and
sell
wood
to
buy
enough
food
to
keep
them
both
alive
he
often
went
hungry
himself
so
that
his
father
might
have
his
warm
wine
one
day
he
went
by
another
path
up
one
of
the
mountain
dells
with
his
rope
basket
strapped
to
his
back
and
the
empty
at
his
belt
while
gloomily
grieving
over
his
hard
luck
the
faint
odor
of
seemed
borne
on
the
breeze
he
snuffed
the
air
it
was
no
mistake
here
luck
surely
said
he
throwing
down
his
bundle
hurrying
forward
he
saw
a
foaming
waterfall
tumbling
over
the
rocks
in
a
thick
stream
as
he
drew
near
some
of
the
spray
fell
on
his
tongue
he
tasted
it
smacked
his
lips
and
throwing
down
his
cord
and
basket
to
the
ground
filled
his
gourd
and
hastened
home
to
his
father
every
day
till
the
end
of
his
father
life
did
he
come
to
this
wonderful
cascade
of
wine
and
thus
the
old
man
was
nourished
for
many
a
long
year
the
news
of
this
fountain
of
youth
spread
abroad
until
it
reached
the
court
the
mikado
hearing
of
it
made
a
journey
to
mino
to
see
the
wonderful
waterfall
in
honor
of
this
event
and
as
a
reward
of
filial
piety
the
name
of
the
was
changed
to
yoro
nourishing
old
age
to
this
day
many
people
young
and
old
go
out
to
enjoy
picnic
parties
at
the
foot
of
the
waterfall
which
now
however
runs
honest
water
only
which
makes
the
cheeks
red
and
not
the
wonderful
wine
that
once
tipped
the
old
daddy
nose
with
perpetual
vermilion
the
earthquake
fish
mukashi
mukashi
as
most
japanese
stories
begin
long
long
ago
when
the
gods
came
down
from
heaven
to
subdue
the
earth
for
the
mikados
and
civilize
the
country
there
were
a
great
many
earthquakes
and
nothing
to
stop
them
the
world
continually
rocked
and
men
houses
and
lives
were
never
safe
now
the
two
gods
who
were
charged
with
the
work
of
subduing
the
northeastern
part
of
the
world
were
kashima
and
katori
having
done
their
work
well
and
quieted
all
the
enemies
of
the
they
came
to
the
province
of
hitachi
kashima
sticking
his
sword
into
the
earth
ran
it
through
to
the
other
side
leaving
the
hilt
above
the
ground
in
the
course
of
centuries
this
mighty
sword
shrunk
and
turned
to
stone
and
the
people
gave
it
the
name
of
the
rock
of
kanamé
now
kanamé
means
the
rivet
in
a
fan
that
holds
all
the
sticks
together
and
they
gave
the
name
because
it
is
the
rivet
that
binds
the
earth
together
no
one
could
ever
lift
this
rock
except
kashima
the
mighty
one
who
first
set
it
in
the
earth
yet
even
kashima
never
raises
it
except
to
stop
an
earthquake
of
unusual
violence
when
the
earth
quivers
it
is
because
the
great
or
is
restless
or
angry
this
is
a
great
creature
something
like
a
catfish
it
is
about
seven
hundred
miles
long
and
holds
the
world
on
its
back
its
tail
is
at
awomori
in
the
north
and
the
base
of
its
head
is
at
kioto
so
that
all
japan
lies
on
top
of
it
to
his
mouth
are
attached
huge
twirling
feelers
which
are
just
like
the
hideous
moustaches
which
the
men
from
beyond
the
pacific
ocean
wear
on
their
lips
as
soon
as
these
begin
to
move
it
is
a
sign
that
the
monster
is
in
wrath
when
he
gets
angry
and
flaps
his
tail
or
bumps
his
head
there
is
an
earthquake
when
he
flounders
about
or
rolls
over
there
is
terrible
destruction
of
life
and
property
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
above
in
order
to
keep
the
quiet
the
great
giant
kashima
is
appointed
to
watch
him
his
business
is
to
stand
near
by
and
when
the
monster
becomes
violent
kashima
must
jump
up
and
straddle
him
and
hold
his
gills
put
his
foot
on
his
fin
and
when
necessary
lift
up
the
great
rock
of
kanamé
and
hold
him
down
with
its
weight
then
he
becomes
perfectly
quiet
and
the
earthquake
ceases
hence
the
people
sing
this
earthquake
verse
no
monster
can
move
the
kanamé
rock
though
he
tug
at
it
never
so
hard
for
over
it
stands
resisting
the
shock
the
kashima
kami
on
guard
another
verse
they
sing
as
follows
these
are
things
an
earthquake
brings
at
nine
of
the
bell
they
sickness
fortell
at
five
and
seven
betoken
rain
at
four
the
sky
is
cleared
thereby
at
six
and
eight
comes
wind
again
the
dream
story
of
gojiro
only
a
few
years
ago
there
was
a
gentleman
in
fukui
japan
who
had
a
son
a
bright
lad
of
twelve
who
was
very
diligent
at
school
and
had
made
astonishing
progress
in
his
studies
he
was
especially
quick
at
learning
chinese
characters
of
which
every
japanese
gentleman
who
wishes
to
be
called
educated
must
know
at
least
two
thousand
for
although
the
chinese
and
japanese
are
two
very
different
languages
yet
the
japanese
coreans
and
chinese
use
the
same
letters
to
write
with
just
as
english
germans
french
and
spaniards
all
employ
one
and
the
same
alphabet
now
gojiro
father
had
promised
him
that
when
he
read
through
five
volumes
of
the
nihongi
or
ancient
history
of
japan
he
would
give
him
for
a
present
a
book
of
wonderful
chinese
stories
gojiro
performed
his
task
and
his
father
kept
his
promise
one
day
on
his
return
from
a
journey
to
kioto
he
presented
his
son
with
sixteen
volumes
all
neatly
well
illustrated
with
and
printed
clearly
on
thin
silky
mulberry
paper
from
the
best
wooden
blocks
it
will
be
remembered
that
several
volumes
of
japanese
literature
make
but
one
of
ours
as
they
are
much
lighter
and
thinner
than
ours
gojiro
was
so
delighted
with
the
wonderful
stories
of
heroes
and
warriors
travelers
and
sailors
that
he
almost
felt
himself
in
china
he
read
far
into
the
night
with
the
lamp
inside
of
his
musquito
curtain
and
finally
fell
asleep
still
undressed
but
with
his
head
full
of
all
sorts
of
chinese
wonders
he
dreamed
he
was
far
away
in
china
walking
along
the
banks
of
the
great
yellow
river
everything
was
very
strange
the
people
talked
an
entirely
different
language
from
his
own
had
on
different
clothes
and
instead
of
the
nice
shaven
head
and
of
the
japanese
every
one
wore
a
long
pigtail
of
hair
that
dangled
at
his
heels
even
the
boats
were
of
a
strange
form
and
on
the
fishing
smacks
perched
on
projecting
rails
sat
rows
of
cormorants
each
with
a
ring
around
his
neck
every
few
minutes
one
of
them
would
dive
under
the
water
and
after
a
while
come
struggling
up
with
a
fish
in
its
mouth
so
big
that
the
fishermen
had
to
help
the
bird
into
the
boat
the
game
was
then
flung
into
a
basket
and
the
cormorant
was
treated
to
a
slice
of
raw
fish
by
way
of
encouragement
and
to
keep
the
bird
from
the
bad
habit
of
eating
the
live
fish
whole
this
the
ravenous
bird
would
sometimes
try
to
do
even
though
the
ring
was
put
around
his
neck
for
the
express
purpose
of
preventing
him
from
gulping
down
a
whole
fish
at
once
it
was
springtime
and
the
buds
were
just
bursting
into
flower
the
river
was
full
of
fish
especially
of
carp
ascending
to
the
great
rapids
or
cascades
here
the
current
ran
at
a
prodigious
rate
of
swiftness
and
the
waters
rippled
and
boiled
and
roared
with
frightful
noise
yet
strange
to
say
many
of
the
fish
were
swimming
up
the
stream
as
if
their
lives
depended
on
it
they
leaped
and
floundered
about
but
every
one
seemed
to
be
tossed
back
and
left
exhausted
in
the
river
where
they
panted
and
gasped
for
breath
in
the
eddies
at
the
side
some
were
so
bruised
against
the
rocks
that
after
a
few
spasms
they
floated
white
and
stiff
belly
up
on
the
water
dead
and
were
swept
down
the
stream
still
the
shoal
leaped
and
strained
every
fin
until
their
scales
flashed
in
the
sun
like
a
host
of
armored
warriors
in
battle
gojiro
enjoying
it
as
if
it
were
a
real
conflict
of
wave
and
fishes
clapped
his
hands
with
delight
then
gojiro
inquired
by
means
of
writing
of
an
old
sage
standing
by
and
looking
on
what
is
the
name
of
this
part
of
the
river
we
call
it
lung
men
said
the
sage
will
you
please
write
the
characters
for
it
said
gojiro
producing
his
and
with
a
roll
of
soft
mulberry
paper
the
sage
wrote
the
two
chinese
characters
meaning
the
gate
of
the
dragons
or
dragons
gate
and
turned
away
to
watch
a
carp
that
seemed
almost
up
into
smooth
water
oh
i
see
said
gojiro
to
himself
that
pronounced
riu
mon
in
japanese
i
go
further
on
and
see
there
must
be
some
meaning
in
this
he
went
forward
a
few
rods
to
where
the
banks
trended
upward
into
high
bluffs
crowned
by
towering
firs
through
the
top
branches
of
which
fleecy
white
clouds
sailed
slowly
along
so
near
the
sky
did
the
seem
down
under
the
cliffs
the
river
ran
perfectly
smooth
almost
like
a
mirror
and
broadened
out
to
the
opposite
shore
far
back
along
the
current
he
could
still
see
the
rapids
shelving
down
it
was
crowded
at
the
bottom
with
leaping
fish
whose
numbers
gradually
thinned
out
toward
the
center
while
near
the
top
close
to
the
edge
of
level
water
one
solitary
fish
of
powerful
fin
and
tail
breasted
the
steep
stream
now
forward
a
leap
then
a
slide
backward
sometimes
further
to
the
rear
than
the
next
leap
made
up
for
then
steady
progress
then
a
slip
but
every
moment
nearer
until
clearing
foam
and
ripple
and
spray
at
one
bound
it
passed
the
edge
and
swam
happily
in
smooth
water
it
was
inside
the
dragon
gate
now
came
the
wonderful
change
one
of
the
fleecy
white
clouds
suddenly
left
the
host
in
the
deep
blue
above
dipped
down
from
the
sky
and
swirling
round
and
round
as
if
it
were
a
water
spout
scratched
and
frayed
the
edge
of
the
water
like
a
fisher
troll
the
carp
saw
and
darted
toward
it
in
a
moment
the
fish
was
transformed
into
a
white
dragon
and
rising
into
the
cloud
floated
off
toward
heaven
a
streak
or
two
of
red
fire
a
gleam
of
terrible
eyes
and
the
flash
of
white
scales
was
all
that
gojiro
saw
then
he
awoke
how
strange
that
a
poor
little
carp
a
common
fish
that
lives
in
the
river
should
become
a
great
white
dragon
and
soar
up
into
the
sky
to
live
there
thought
gojiro
the
next
day
as
he
told
his
mother
of
his
dream
yes
said
she
and
what
a
lesson
for
you
see
how
the
carp
persevered
leaping
over
all
difficulties
never
giving
up
till
it
became
a
dragon
i
hope
my
son
will
mount
over
all
obstacles
and
rise
to
honor
and
to
high
office
under
the
government
oh
oh
now
i
see
said
gojiro
that
is
what
my
teacher
means
when
he
says
the
students
in
tokio
have
a
saying
a
fish
to
day
but
i
hope
to
be
a
dragon
when
they
go
to
attend
examination
and
what
papa
meant
when
he
said
fish
son
kofuku
has
become
a
white
dragon
while
i
am
yet
only
a
carp
illustration
the
ascent
of
the
dragon
gate
so
on
the
third
day
of
the
third
month
at
the
feast
of
flags
gojiro
hoisted
the
it
was
a
great
fish
made
of
paper
fifteen
feet
long
and
hollow
like
a
bag
it
was
yellow
with
black
scales
and
streaks
of
gold
and
red
gills
and
mouth
in
which
two
strong
strings
were
fastened
it
was
hoisted
up
by
a
rope
to
the
top
of
a
high
bamboo
pole
on
the
roof
of
the
house
there
the
breeze
caught
it
swelled
it
out
round
and
full
of
air
the
wind
made
the
fins
work
and
the
tail
flap
and
the
head
tug
until
it
looked
just
like
a
carp
trying
to
swim
the
rapids
of
the
yellow
river
the
symbol
of
ambition
and
perseverance
the
procession
of
lord
lovely
and
bright
in
the
month
of
may
at
the
time
of
was
the
day
on
which
the
daimio
lord
was
informed
by
his
chamberlain
that
on
the
morrow
his
lordship
retinue
would
be
in
readiness
to
accompany
their
worshipful
lord
on
his
journey
this
lord
was
a
daimio
who
ruled
over
four
acres
of
in
echizen
whose
revenue
was
ten
thousand
his
retainers
who
were
all
grasshoppers
numbered
over
six
thousand
while
his
court
consisted
only
of
nobles
such
as
mantis
beetle
and
the
maids
of
honor
who
waited
on
his
queen
katydid
were
butterflies
and
goldsmiths
and
his
messengers
were
and
once
in
a
while
a
beetle
was
sent
on
an
errand
but
these
stupid
fellows
had
such
a
habit
of
running
plump
into
things
and
bumping
their
heads
so
badly
that
they
always
forgot
what
they
were
sent
for
besides
these
he
had
a
great
many
servants
in
the
kitchen
such
as
grubs
spiders
toads
etc
the
entire
population
of
his
dominion
including
the
common
folks
numbered
several
millions
and
ranked
all
the
way
from
down
to
ants
mosquitoes
and
ticks
many
of
his
subjects
were
very
industrious
and
produced
fine
fabrics
which
however
were
seized
and
made
use
of
by
great
monsters
called
men
thus
the
gray
worms
kept
in
their
heads
they
had
a
fashion
of
eating
mulberry
leaves
and
changing
them
into
fine
threads
called
silk
the
wasps
made
paper
and
the
bees
distilled
honey
there
was
another
insect
which
spread
white
wax
on
the
trees
these
were
all
retainers
or
friendly
vassals
of
lord
now
it
was
lord
duty
once
a
year
to
go
up
to
yedo
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
great
tycoon
and
to
spend
several
weeks
in
the
eastern
metropolis
i
shall
not
take
the
time
nor
tax
the
patience
of
my
readers
in
telling
about
all
the
bustle
and
preparation
that
went
on
in
the
yashiki
mansion
of
lord
for
a
whole
week
previous
to
starting
suffice
it
to
say
that
clothes
were
washed
and
starched
and
dried
on
a
board
to
keep
them
from
shrinking
trunks
and
baskets
were
packed
banners
and
umbrellas
were
put
in
order
the
lacquer
on
the
brass
ornaments
shields
and
swords
and
spears
were
all
polished
and
every
little
item
was
personally
examined
by
the
daimio
chief
inspector
this
functionary
was
a
mosquito
who
on
account
of
his
long
nose
could
pry
into
a
thing
further
and
see
it
easier
than
any
other
of
his
lordship
officers
and
if
anything
went
wrong
he
could
make
more
noise
over
it
than
any
one
else
as
for
the
retainers
down
to
the
very
last
lackey
and
coolie
each
one
tried
to
outshine
the
other
in
cleanliness
and
spruce
dress
the
brushed
off
the
pollen
from
his
legs
and
the
humbler
after
allowing
his
children
to
suck
his
paws
to
get
the
honey
sticking
to
them
spruced
up
and
listened
attentively
to
the
orders
read
to
him
by
the
sir
locust
who
prided
himself
on
being
seventeen
years
old
and
looked
on
all
the
others
as
children
he
read
from
a
piece
of
paper
no
leaving
the
line
to
suck
flowers
except
at
the
fly
washed
his
hands
and
face
over
and
over
again
the
wept
many
tears
because
they
could
not
go
with
the
company
the
crickets
chirped
rather
gloomily
because
none
with
short
limbs
could
go
on
the
journey
while
daddy
almost
turned
a
somersault
for
joy
when
told
he
might
carry
a
bundle
in
the
train
all
being
in
readiness
the
procession
was
to
start
at
six
in
the
morning
the
exact
minute
was
to
be
announced
by
the
of
the
mansion
flea
san
whose
house
was
on
the
back
of
neko
a
great
black
cat
who
lived
in
the
porter
lodge
of
the
castle
near
by
flea
san
was
to
notice
the
opening
or
slits
in
the
eyes
which
when
closed
to
a
certain
width
would
indicate
six
then
with
a
few
jumps
she
was
to
announce
it
to
a
mosquito
friend
of
hers
who
would
fly
with
the
news
to
the
of
the
yashiki
one
whirligig
by
name
so
punctually
to
the
hour
the
great
double
gate
swung
wide
open
and
the
procession
passed
out
and
marched
on
over
the
hill
all
the
servants
of
lord
were
out
to
see
the
grand
sight
they
were
down
on
their
knees
saying
o
shidzukani
please
go
slowly
when
their
master
palanquin
passed
they
bowed
their
heads
to
the
dust
as
was
proper
the
ladies
who
were
left
behind
cried
bitterly
and
soaked
their
paper
handkerchiefs
with
tears
especially
one
fair
brown
creature
who
was
next
of
kin
to
lord
being
an
ant
on
his
side
the
procession
was
closed
by
six
old
daddies
spiders
marching
two
by
two
who
were
a
little
stupid
and
groggy
having
had
a
late
supper
and
a
jolly
feast
the
night
before
when
the
great
gate
slammed
shut
one
of
them
caught
the
end
of
his
foot
in
it
and
was
lamed
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
this
old
daddy
hobbling
along
with
a
bundle
on
his
back
was
the
only
funny
thing
in
the
procession
and
made
much
talk
among
bystanders
on
the
road
this
is
the
order
and
the
way
they
looked
first
there
went
out
far
ahead
a
plump
tall
mantis
with
a
great
long
baton
of
grass
which
he
swung
to
and
fro
before
him
from
right
to
left
like
a
crying
out
down
on
your
knees
get
down
with
you
whereat
all
the
ants
bugs
and
lizards
at
once
bent
their
forelegs
and
the
toads
which
were
already
squatting
bobbed
their
noses
in
the
dust
even
the
poked
their
heads
out
of
the
water
to
see
what
was
going
on
all
the
worms
and
grubs
who
lived
up
in
trees
or
tall
bushes
had
to
come
down
to
the
ground
it
was
forbidden
to
any
insect
to
remain
on
a
high
stalk
of
grass
lest
he
might
look
down
on
his
highness
even
the
had
to
wind
himself
up
and
stop
measuring
his
length
while
the
line
was
passing
and
in
case
of
grubs
or
moths
in
the
nest
or
cocoon
too
young
to
crawl
out
the
law
compelled
their
parents
to
cover
them
over
with
a
leaf
it
would
be
an
insult
to
lord
to
look
down
on
him
next
followed
two
holding
for
lanterns
in
their
these
were
wrapped
in
cases
made
of
leaves
which
they
took
off
at
night
behind
were
six
well
supplied
with
lamps
which
they
kept
hidden
somewhere
under
their
wings
next
marched
four
abreast
the
band
of
little
weevils
carrying
the
umbrellas
of
state
which
were
some
open
some
shut
behind
them
strutted
four
green
grasshoppers
who
were
carrying
pink
blossoms
just
before
the
palanquin
were
two
tall
dandies
high
lords
themselves
and
of
gigantic
stature
and
imposing
bellies
who
with
arms
akimbo
and
feelers
far
up
in
the
air
bore
aloft
high
over
all
the
insignia
of
their
lord
all
these
fellows
strutted
along
on
their
hind
legs
their
backs
as
stiff
as
a
hemp
stalk
their
noses
pointing
to
the
stars
and
their
legs
striding
like
stilts
the
priest
in
his
robes
a
praying
beetle
who
was
chaplain
walked
on
solemnly
meanwhile
a
great
crowd
of
spectators
lined
the
path
but
all
were
on
their
knees
frogs
and
toads
blinked
out
of
the
sides
of
their
heads
the
pretty
red
lizards
glided
out
to
see
the
splendid
show
worms
stopped
crawling
and
all
kinds
of
bugs
ceased
climbing
and
came
down
from
the
grass
and
to
bow
humbly
before
the
train
of
lord
bug
mothers
hastened
with
their
bug
babies
on
their
backs
down
to
the
road
and
squatting
down
taught
their
little
nits
to
put
their
politely
together
and
bow
down
on
their
front
knees
no
one
dared
to
speak
out
loud
but
the
nudging
his
fellow
under
the
wing
said
just
look
at
that
green
mantis
he
looks
as
though
would
rush
out
with
a
on
his
shoulder
to
meet
a
chariot
see
how
he
ogles
his
fellow
yes
and
just
behold
that
hopper
will
you
i
could
walk
better
than
that
myself
said
the
other
said
the
here
comes
the
palanquin
everybody
now
cast
a
squint
up
under
their
eyebrows
and
watched
the
palanquin
go
by
it
was
made
of
striped
grass
bound
with
bamboo
threads
lacquered
and
finished
with
curtains
of
gauze
made
of
wings
through
which
lord
could
peep
it
was
borne
on
the
shoulders
of
four
stalwart
hoppers
who
carrying
of
grass
trudged
along
with
much
sweat
and
fuss
and
wiping
of
their
foreheads
stopping
occasionally
to
change
shoulders
at
their
side
walked
a
of
eight
hoppers
armed
with
pistils
and
having
of
they
were
also
provided
with
in
case
of
trouble
other
bearers
followed
keeping
step
and
carrying
the
regalia
consisting
of
chrysanthemum
stalks
and
blossoms
then
followed
in
double
rank
a
long
string
of
wasps
who
were
for
show
and
nothing
more
between
them
inside
carefully
saddled
bridled
and
in
full
housings
was
a
led
by
a
snail
to
keep
the
restive
animal
from
going
at
a
too
rapid
pace
three
big
gawky
beetles
next
followed
bearing
with
full
heads
of
rice
oh
oh
look
there
cried
a
little
grub
at
the
side
of
the
road
see
the
little
grasshopper
riding
on
his
father
back
hai
said
mother
butterfly
putting
one
paw
on
her
baby
neck
for
fear
of
being
arrested
for
making
a
noise
it
was
so
the
little
tired
of
long
walking
had
climbed
on
his
father
back
for
a
ride
holding
on
by
the
feelers
and
seeing
everything
finally
toward
the
end
of
the
procession
was
a
great
crowd
of
common
beetles
and
bugs
of
all
sorts
carrying
the
presents
to
be
given
in
yedo
and
the
clothing
food
and
utensils
for
the
use
of
lord
on
the
journey
for
the
hotels
were
sometimes
very
poor
on
the
tokaido
high
road
and
the
daimio
liked
his
comforts
besides
it
was
necessary
for
lord
to
travel
with
proper
dignity
as
became
a
daimio
his
messengers
always
went
before
and
engaged
as
the
fleas
spiders
and
mosquitoes
from
other
localities
who
traveled
up
and
down
the
great
high
road
sometimes
occupied
the
places
first
the
procession
wound
up
by
the
of
daddy
who
prevented
any
insult
or
disrespect
from
the
rabble
after
the
line
had
passed
insects
could
cross
the
road
traffic
and
travel
were
resumed
and
the
road
was
cleared
while
the
procession
faded
from
view
in
the
distance
kiyohime
or
the
power
of
love
quiet
and
shady
was
the
spot
in
the
midst
of
one
of
the
loveliest
valley
landscapes
in
the
empire
near
the
banks
of
the
hidaka
river
where
stood
the
kept
by
one
kojima
it
was
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
glorious
mountains
ever
robed
with
deep
forests
with
flashing
to
which
the
lovers
of
nature
paid
many
a
visit
and
in
which
poets
were
inspired
to
write
stanzas
in
praise
of
the
white
foam
and
the
twinkling
streamlets
here
the
bonzes
loved
to
muse
and
meditate
and
anon
merry
picnic
parties
spread
their
mats
looped
their
canvas
screens
and
feasted
out
of
nests
of
lacquered
boxes
drinking
the
amber
saké
from
cups
no
larger
nor
thicker
than
an
while
the
sound
of
guitar
and
drum
kept
time
to
dance
and
song
the
garden
of
the
was
as
lovely
a
piece
of
art
as
the
cunning
could
produce
those
who
emerged
from
the
deep
woods
of
the
lofty
hill
called
the
dragon
claw
could
see
in
the
garden
a
living
copy
of
the
landscape
before
them
there
were
mimic
mountains
ten
feet
high
and
miniature
hills
veined
by
a
tiny
path
with
dwarfed
pine
groves
and
tiny
bamboo
clumps
and
a
patch
of
grass
for
meadow
and
a
valley
just
like
the
great
gully
of
the
mountains
only
a
thousand
times
smaller
and
but
twenty
feet
long
so
perfect
was
the
imitation
that
even
the
miniature
irrigated
each
no
larger
than
a
were
in
full
sprout
to
make
this
little
gem
of
nature
in
art
complete
there
fell
from
over
a
rock
at
one
end
a
lovely
little
waterfall
two
feet
high
which
after
an
angry
splash
over
the
stones
rolled
on
over
an
absurdly
small
beech
all
and
pebbled
threading
its
silver
way
beyond
until
lost
in
fringes
of
lilies
and
aquatic
plants
in
one
broad
space
imitating
a
lake
was
a
lotus
pond
lined
with
iris
in
which
the
fins
of
gold
fish
and
silver
carp
flashed
in
the
sunbeams
here
and
there
the
nose
of
a
tortoise
protruded
while
on
a
rugged
rock
sat
an
old
grandfather
surveying
the
scene
with
one
or
two
of
his
asleep
on
his
shell
and
sunning
themselves
the
fame
of
the
its
excellent
fare
and
special
delicacy
of
its
mountain
trout
and
drew
hundreds
of
visitors
especially
and
lovers
of
grand
scenery
just
across
the
river
which
was
visible
from
the
verandah
of
the
stood
the
lofty
firs
that
surrounded
the
temple
of
the
tendai
buddhists
hard
by
was
the
pagoda
which
painted
red
peeped
between
the
trees
a
long
row
of
and
dwellings
to
the
right
made
up
the
monastery
in
which
a
snowy
but
old
abbot
and
some
twenty
bonzes
dwelt
all
and
in
crape
robes
and
straw
sandals
their
only
food
being
water
and
vegetables
not
the
least
noticeable
of
the
array
of
stone
lanterns
and
bronze
images
with
aureoles
round
their
heads
and
incense
burners
and
holy
water
tanks
and
dragon
spouts
was
the
belfry
which
stood
on
a
stone
platform
under
its
roof
hung
the
massive
bronze
bell
ten
feet
high
which
when
struck
with
a
suspended
log
like
a
boomed
solemnly
over
the
valley
and
flooded
three
leagues
of
space
with
the
melody
which
died
away
as
sweetly
as
an
infant
falling
in
slumber
this
mighty
bell
was
six
inches
thick
and
weighed
several
tons
in
describing
the
across
the
river
the
story
of
its
sweetest
charm
and
of
its
garden
the
fairest
flower
must
not
be
left
untold
kiyo
the
host
daughter
was
a
lovely
maiden
of
but
eighteen
as
graceful
as
the
bamboo
reed
swaying
in
the
breeze
of
a
moonlit
eve
and
as
pretty
as
the
blossoms
of
the
far
and
wide
floated
the
fame
of
kiyo
like
the
fragrance
of
the
white
lilies
of
ibuki
when
the
wind
sweeping
down
the
mountain
heights
comes
to
the
traveler
as
she
busied
herself
about
the
garden
or
as
her
white
socks
slipped
over
the
floor
she
was
the
picture
of
grace
itself
when
at
twilight
with
her
own
hands
she
lighted
the
gay
lanterns
that
hung
in
festoons
along
the
eaves
of
the
above
the
verandah
her
bright
eyes
sparkling
her
red
petticoats
half
visible
through
her
crape
robe
she
made
many
a
young
man
heart
glow
with
a
strange
new
feeling
or
burn
with
pangs
of
jealousy
among
the
priests
that
often
passed
by
the
on
their
way
to
the
monastery
were
some
who
were
young
and
handsome
it
was
the
rule
of
the
monastery
that
none
of
the
bonzes
should
drink
saké
wine
eat
fish
or
meat
or
even
stop
at
the
to
talk
with
women
but
one
young
bonze
named
after
a
passage
in
the
sanscrit
classics
had
rigidly
kept
the
rules
fish
had
never
passed
his
mouth
and
as
for
saké
he
did
not
know
even
its
taste
he
was
very
studious
and
diligent
every
day
he
learned
ten
new
chinese
characters
he
had
already
read
several
of
the
sacred
sutras
had
made
a
good
beginning
in
sanskrit
knew
the
name
of
every
idol
in
the
temple
of
the
images
in
kioto
had
twice
visited
the
sacred
shrine
of
the
capital
and
had
uttered
the
prayer
namu
miō
ho
ren
gé
kiō
glory
be
to
the
sacred
lotus
of
the
law
counting
it
on
his
rosary
five
hundred
thousand
times
for
sanctity
and
learning
he
had
no
peer
among
the
young
neophytes
of
the
bonzerie
alas
for
one
day
after
returning
from
a
visit
to
a
famous
shrine
in
the
kuanto
eastern
japan
as
he
was
passing
the
he
caught
sight
of
kiyohimé
the
lady
or
princess
kiyo
and
from
that
moment
his
pain
of
heart
began
he
returned
to
his
bed
of
mats
but
not
to
sleep
for
days
he
tried
to
stifle
his
passion
but
his
heart
only
smouldered
away
like
an
before
many
days
he
made
a
pretext
for
again
passing
the
house
hopelessly
in
love
without
waiting
many
days
he
stopped
and
entered
the
his
call
for
refreshments
was
answered
by
kiyohimé
herself
as
fire
kindles
fire
so
priest
and
maiden
were
now
consumed
in
one
flame
of
love
to
shorten
a
long
story
visited
the
inn
oftener
and
oftener
even
stealing
out
at
night
to
cross
the
river
and
spend
the
silent
hours
with
his
love
so
passed
several
months
when
suddenly
a
change
come
over
the
young
bonze
his
conscience
began
to
trouble
him
for
breaking
his
vows
in
the
terrible
conflict
between
principle
and
passion
the
soul
of
the
priest
was
tossed
to
and
fro
like
the
feathered
of
a
shuttlecock
but
conscience
was
the
stronger
and
won
he
resolved
to
drown
his
love
and
break
off
his
connection
with
the
girl
to
do
it
suddenly
would
bring
grief
to
her
and
a
scandal
both
on
her
family
and
the
monastery
he
must
do
it
gradually
to
succeed
at
all
ah
how
quickly
does
the
sensitive
know
the
touch
of
cooling
passion
how
quickly
falls
the
silver
column
in
the
crystal
tube
at
the
first
breath
of
the
heart
chill
even
though
the
words
on
the
lip
are
warm
kiyohimé
marked
the
ebbing
tide
of
her
lover
regard
and
then
a
terrible
resolve
of
evil
took
possession
of
her
soul
from
that
time
forth
she
ceased
to
be
a
pure
and
innocent
and
gentle
virgin
though
still
in
maiden
form
and
guise
she
was
at
heart
a
fox
and
as
to
her
nature
she
might
as
well
have
worn
the
bushy
tail
of
the
sly
deceiver
she
resolved
to
win
over
her
lover
by
her
importunities
and
failing
in
this
to
destroy
him
by
sorcery
one
night
she
sat
up
until
two
in
the
morning
and
then
arrayed
only
in
a
white
robe
she
went
out
to
a
secluded
part
of
the
mountain
where
in
a
lonely
shrine
stood
a
hideous
scowling
image
of
fudo
who
holds
the
sword
of
vengeance
and
sits
clothed
in
fire
there
she
called
upon
the
god
to
change
her
lover
heart
or
else
destroy
him
thence
with
her
head
shaking
and
eyes
glittering
with
anger
like
the
orbs
of
a
serpent
she
hastened
to
the
shrine
of
kampira
whose
servants
are
the
sprites
who
have
the
power
of
magic
and
of
teaching
sorcery
standing
in
front
of
the
portal
she
saw
it
hung
with
votive
tablets
locks
of
hair
teeth
various
tokens
of
vows
pledges
and
marks
of
sacrifice
which
the
devotees
of
the
god
had
hung
up
there
in
the
cold
night
air
she
asked
for
the
power
of
sorcery
that
she
might
be
able
at
will
to
transform
herself
into
the
terrible
the
awful
whose
engine
coils
are
able
to
crack
bones
crush
rocks
melt
iron
or
root
up
trees
and
which
are
long
enough
to
wind
round
a
mountain
it
would
be
too
long
to
tell
how
this
once
pure
and
happy
maiden
now
turned
to
an
avenging
demon
went
out
nightly
on
the
lonely
mountains
to
practice
the
arts
of
sorcery
the
were
her
teachers
and
she
learned
so
diligently
that
the
chief
goblin
at
last
told
her
she
would
be
able
without
fail
to
transform
herself
when
she
wished
the
dreadful
moment
was
soon
to
come
the
visits
of
the
once
gradually
became
fewer
and
fewer
and
were
no
longer
tender
hours
of
love
but
were
on
his
part
formal
interviews
while
kiyohimé
became
more
importunate
than
ever
tears
and
pleadings
were
alike
useless
and
finally
one
night
as
he
was
taking
leave
the
bonze
told
the
maid
that
he
had
paid
his
last
visit
kiyohimé
then
utterly
forgetting
all
womanly
delicacy
became
so
urgent
that
the
bonze
tore
himself
away
and
fled
across
the
river
he
had
seen
the
terrible
gleam
in
the
maiden
eyes
and
now
terribly
frightened
hid
himself
under
the
great
temple
bell
forthwith
kiyohimé
seeing
the
awful
moment
had
come
pronounced
the
spell
of
incantation
taught
her
by
the
mountain
spirit
and
raised
her
wand
in
a
moment
her
fair
head
and
lovely
face
body
limbs
and
feet
lengthened
out
disappeared
or
became
and
a
serpent
with
eyes
like
moons
trailed
over
the
ground
towards
the
temple
swam
the
river
and
scenting
out
the
track
of
the
fugitive
entered
the
belfry
cracking
the
supporting
columns
made
of
whole
into
a
mass
of
ruins
while
the
bell
fell
to
the
earth
with
the
cowering
victim
inside
then
began
the
winding
of
the
terrible
coils
round
and
round
the
metal
as
with
her
wand
of
sorcery
in
her
hands
she
mounted
the
bell
the
glistening
scales
hard
as
iron
struck
off
sparks
as
the
pressure
increased
tighter
and
tighter
they
were
drawn
till
the
heat
of
the
friction
consumed
the
timbers
and
made
the
metal
glow
hot
like
fire
illustration
the
sorceress
melting
the
bell
vain
was
the
prayer
of
priest
or
spell
of
rosary
as
the
bonzes
piteously
besought
great
buddha
to
destroy
the
demon
hotter
and
hotter
grew
the
mass
until
the
ponderous
metal
melted
down
into
a
hissing
pool
of
scintillating
molten
bronze
and
soon
man
within
and
serpent
without
timber
and
tiles
and
ropes
were
nought
but
a
few
handfuls
of
white
ashes
the
fisherman
and
the
pearly
and
lustrous
white
like
a
cloud
in
the
blue
sky
seemed
the
floating
figure
of
the
as
she
flew
to
earth
she
was
one
of
the
fifteen
glistening
virgins
that
wait
attendant
upon
the
moon
in
her
chambers
in
the
sky
looking
down
from
her
high
home
to
the
earth
she
became
enraptured
with
the
glorious
scenery
of
suruga
ocean
shore
and
longed
for
a
bath
in
the
blue
waters
of
the
sea
so
this
fairy
maid
sped
to
the
earth
one
morning
early
when
the
moon
having
shone
through
the
night
was
about
to
retire
for
the
day
the
sun
was
rising
bright
and
red
over
the
eastern
seas
flushing
the
mountains
and
purpling
the
valleys
out
amid
the
sparkling
waves
the
ships
sailed
toward
the
sun
and
the
fishermen
cast
their
nets
it
was
in
early
spring
when
the
air
was
full
of
the
fragrance
of
plum
blossoms
and
the
zephyrs
blew
so
softly
that
scarce
a
bamboo
leaf
quivered
or
a
wave
lapsed
with
sound
on
the
silvery
shore
the
was
so
charmed
with
the
scenery
of
earth
that
she
longed
to
linger
above
it
to
gaze
tranquilly
floating
slowly
through
the
air
she
directed
her
course
to
the
pine
groves
that
fringe
the
strand
near
cape
miwo
lying
at
the
base
of
fuji
mountain
whose
snowy
crown
glistens
above
fronting
the
ocean
whose
blue
plain
undulates
in
liquid
glory
till
it
meets
the
bending
sky
the
scenery
of
miwo
is
renowned
everywhere
under
the
whole
heavens
but
especially
in
the
land
which
the
mikado
reign
blesses
with
peace
full
of
happiness
the
fairy
maiden
played
sweet
music
from
her
flute
until
the
air
was
full
of
it
and
it
sounded
to
the
dweller
on
earth
like
the
sweet
falling
of
rain
drops
on
the
thirsty
ground
her
body
shed
sweet
fragrance
through
the
air
and
flowers
fell
from
her
robes
as
she
passed
though
none
saw
her
form
all
wondered
arriving
over
a
charming
spot
on
the
sea
shore
she
descended
to
the
strand
and
stood
at
the
foot
of
a
pine
tree
she
laid
her
musical
instrument
on
a
rock
near
by
and
taking
off
her
wings
and
feathered
suit
hung
them
carefully
on
the
pine
tree
bough
then
she
strolled
off
along
the
shore
to
dip
her
shining
feet
in
the
curling
waves
picking
up
some
shells
she
wondered
with
innocent
joy
at
the
rich
tints
which
seemed
more
beautiful
than
any
color
in
the
with
one
a
large
smooth
scallop
she
was
particularly
pleased
for
inside
one
valve
was
a
yellow
disc
and
on
its
mate
was
a
white
one
how
strange
said
she
here
is
the
sun
and
there
is
the
moon
i
shall
call
this
the
and
moon
shell
and
she
put
them
in
her
girdle
it
chanced
that
near
the
edge
of
the
pine
grove
not
far
away
there
dwelt
a
lone
fisherman
who
coming
down
to
the
shore
caught
a
whiff
of
sweet
perfume
such
as
had
never
before
delighted
his
nostrils
what
could
it
be
the
spring
zephyrs
blowing
from
the
west
seemed
laden
with
the
sweet
odor
curiosity
prompted
him
to
seek
the
cause
he
walked
toward
the
pine
tree
and
looking
up
caught
sight
of
the
feathery
suit
of
wings
oh
how
his
eyes
sparkled
he
danced
for
joy
and
taking
down
the
robe
carried
it
to
his
neighbors
all
were
delighted
and
one
old
man
said
that
the
fairy
must
herself
be
near
by
he
advised
the
man
to
seek
until
he
found
her
so
with
feathered
robe
in
hand
the
fisherman
went
out
again
to
the
strand
and
took
his
place
near
the
pine
tree
he
had
not
waited
long
before
a
lovely
being
with
white
skin
and
of
perfect
form
appeared
please
good
sir
give
me
back
my
feathered
robe
said
she
in
a
sad
voice
of
liquid
sweetness
though
she
seemed
greatly
frightened
no
i
must
keep
it
as
a
sacred
treasure
a
relic
from
a
heavenly
visitor
and
dedicate
it
in
the
shrine
yonder
as
a
memorial
of
an
visit
said
the
fisherman
oh
wicked
man
what
a
wretched
and
impious
thing
to
rob
an
inhabitant
of
heaven
of
the
robe
by
which
she
moves
how
can
i
fly
back
to
my
home
again
give
me
your
wings
oh
ye
wild
geese
that
fly
across
the
face
of
the
moon
and
on
tireless
pinions
seek
the
icy
shores
in
spring
time
and
soar
unwearied
homeward
in
autumn
lend
me
your
wings
but
the
wild
geese
overhead
only
whirred
and
screamed
and
bit
their
sprays
of
pine
which
they
carried
in
their
mouth
oh
ye
circling
gulls
lend
me
but
for
a
day
your
downy
wings
i
am
prisoner
here
cried
the
weeping
fairy
but
the
graceful
gulls
hovering
for
a
moment
swept
on
in
widening
circles
out
to
farther
sea
oh
breezes
of
the
air
which
blow
whither
ye
list
oh
tide
of
ocean
which
ebbs
and
flows
at
will
ye
may
move
all
but
i
am
prisoner
here
devoid
of
motion
oh
good
sir
have
pity
and
give
me
back
my
wings
cried
the
pressing
her
hands
together
in
grief
the
fisher
heart
was
touched
by
the
pathos
of
her
voice
and
the
glittering
of
her
tears
i
give
back
your
if
you
dance
and
make
music
for
me
said
he
oh
yes
good
sir
i
will
dance
and
make
music
but
first
let
me
put
on
my
for
without
it
i
have
no
power
of
motion
oh
yes
said
the
suspicious
mortal
if
i
give
you
back
your
wings
you
fly
straight
to
heaven
what
can
you
not
believe
the
word
of
a
heavenly
being
without
doubting
trust
me
in
good
faith
and
you
lose
nothing
then
with
shamed
face
the
fisherman
handed
to
the
her
feathered
robe
which
she
donned
and
began
to
dance
she
poured
out
such
sweet
strains
from
her
upright
flute
that
with
eye
and
ear
full
of
rapture
the
fisherman
imagined
himself
in
heaven
then
she
sang
a
sweet
song
in
which
she
described
the
delights
of
life
in
the
moon
and
the
pleasure
of
celestial
residence
the
fisherman
was
so
overjoyed
that
he
longed
to
detain
the
fairy
he
begged
her
to
dwell
with
him
on
earth
but
in
vain
as
he
looked
he
saw
her
rising
a
fresh
breeze
rippling
the
face
of
the
sea
now
sprang
up
and
wafted
the
pearly
maiden
over
the
hills
and
past
fuji
mountain
all
the
time
sweet
music
rained
through
the
air
until
as
the
fisherman
strained
his
eyes
toward
the
snow
on
crest
he
could
no
longer
distinguish
the
from
the
fleecy
clouds
that
filled
the
thin
air
pondering
long
upon
the
marvelous
apparition
the
fisherman
resolved
to
mark
the
spot
where
the
fairy
first
descended
to
earth
so
he
prevailed
upon
the
simple
villagers
to
build
a
railing
of
stone
around
the
now
sacred
pine
daily
they
garlanded
the
old
trunk
with
festoons
of
tasseled
and
twisted
long
after
when
by
the
storms
of
centuries
the
old
pine
in
spite
of
bandages
and
crutches
and
tired
of
wrestling
with
the
blast
fell
down
like
an
old
man
to
rise
no
more
a
grateful
posterity
cleared
the
space
and
built
the
shrine
of
miwo
which
still
dots
with
its
sacred
enclosure
the
strand
of
suruga
on
which
the
fairy
danced
the
jewels
of
the
ebbing
and
the
flowing
tide
chiuai
was
the
fourteenth
mikado
of
the
land
of
the
gods
japan
his
wife
the
empress
was
named
jingu
or
godlike
exploit
she
was
a
wise
and
discreet
lady
and
assisted
her
husband
to
govern
his
dominions
when
a
great
rebellion
broke
out
in
the
south
island
called
kiushiu
the
mikado
marched
his
army
against
the
rebels
the
empress
went
with
him
and
lived
in
the
camp
one
night
as
she
lay
asleep
in
her
tent
she
dreamed
that
a
heavenly
being
appeared
to
her
and
told
her
of
a
wonderful
land
in
the
west
full
of
gold
silver
jewels
silks
and
precious
stones
the
heavenly
messenger
told
her
if
she
would
invade
this
country
she
would
succeed
and
all
its
spoil
would
be
hers
for
herself
and
japan
conquer
corea
said
the
radiant
being
as
she
floated
away
on
a
purple
cloud
in
the
morning
the
empress
told
her
husband
of
her
dream
and
advised
him
to
set
out
to
invade
the
rich
land
but
he
paid
no
attention
of
her
when
she
insisted
in
order
to
satisfy
her
he
climbed
up
a
high
mountain
and
looking
far
away
towards
the
setting
sun
saw
no
land
thither
not
even
mountain
peaks
so
believing
that
there
was
no
country
in
that
direction
he
descended
and
angrily
refused
to
set
out
on
the
expedition
shortly
after
in
a
battle
with
the
rebels
the
mikado
was
shot
dead
with
an
arrow
the
generals
and
captains
of
the
host
then
declared
their
loyalty
to
the
empress
as
the
sole
ruler
of
japan
she
now
having
the
power
resolved
to
carry
out
her
daring
plan
of
invading
corea
she
invoked
all
the
or
gods
together
from
the
mountains
rivers
and
plains
to
get
their
advice
and
help
all
came
at
her
call
the
kami
of
the
mountains
gave
her
timber
and
iron
for
her
ships
the
kami
of
the
fields
presented
rice
and
grain
for
provisions
the
kami
of
the
grasses
gave
her
hemp
for
cordage
and
the
kami
of
the
winds
promised
to
open
his
bag
and
let
out
his
breezes
to
fill
her
sails
toward
corea
all
came
except
isora
the
kami
of
the
sea
shore
again
she
called
for
him
and
sat
up
waiting
all
night
with
torches
burning
invoking
him
to
appear
now
isora
was
a
lazy
fellow
always
slovenly
and
and
when
at
last
he
did
come
instead
of
appearing
in
state
in
splendid
robes
he
rose
right
out
of
the
covered
with
mud
and
slime
with
shells
sticking
all
over
him
and
clinging
to
his
hair
he
gruffly
asked
what
the
empress
wanted
go
down
to
riu
gu
and
beg
his
majesty
kai
riu
o
the
dragon
king
of
the
world
under
the
sea
to
give
me
the
two
jewels
of
the
tides
said
the
imperial
lady
now
among
the
treasures
in
the
palace
of
the
dragon
king
of
the
world
under
the
sea
were
two
jewels
having
wondrous
power
over
the
tides
they
were
about
as
large
as
apples
but
shaped
like
apricots
with
three
rings
cut
near
the
top
they
seemed
to
be
of
crystal
and
glistened
and
shot
out
dazzling
rays
like
fire
indeed
they
appeared
to
seethe
and
glow
like
the
eye
of
a
dragon
or
the
steel
of
the
one
was
called
the
jewel
of
the
and
the
other
the
jewel
of
the
whoever
owned
them
had
the
power
to
make
the
tides
instantly
rise
or
fall
at
his
word
to
make
the
dry
land
appear
or
the
sea

the
fillip
of
a
finger

dived
with
a
dreadful
splash
down
down
to
riu
gu
and
straightway
presented
himself
before
kai
riu
o
in
the
name
of
the
empress
he
begged
for
the
two
the
dragon
king
agreed
and
producing
the
flaming
globes
from
his
casket
placed
them
on
a
huge
shell
and
handed
them
to
isora
who
brought
the
jewels
to
jingu
who
placed
them
in
her
girdle
the
empress
now
prepared
her
fleet
for
corean
invasion
three
thousand
barges
were
built
and
launched
and
two
old
kami
with
long
streaming
gray
hair
and
wrinkled
faces
were
made
admirals
their
names
were
suwa
daimiō

great
illustrious
spirit
of
suwa
and
sumiyoshi
daimiō
jin
the
kami
who
lives
under
the
old
pine
tree
at
takasago
and
presides
over
nuptial
ceremonies
the
fleet
sailed
in
the
tenth
month
the
hills
of
hizen
soon
began
to
sink
below
the
horizon
but
no
sooner
were
they
out
of
sight
of
land
than
a
great
storm
arose
the
ships
tossed
about
and
began
to
butt
each
other
like
bulls
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
fleet
would
be
driven
back
when
lo
kai
riu
o
sent
shoals
of
huge
and
immense
fishes
that
bore
up
the
ships
and
pushed
their
sterns
forward
with
their
great
snouts
the
shachihoko
or
taking
the
ship
cables
in
their
mouths
towed
them
forward
until
the
storm
ceased
and
the
ocean
was
calm
then
they
plunged
downwards
into
the
sea
and
disappeared
the
mountains
of
corea
now
rose
in
sight
along
the
shore
were
gathered
the
corean
army
their
triangular
fringed
banners
inscribed
with
dragons
flapped
in
the
breeze
as
soon
as
their
sentinels
caught
sight
of
the
japanese
fleet
the
signal
was
given
and
the
corean
line
of
war
galleys
moved
gaily
out
to
attack
the
japanese
the
empress
posted
her
archers
in
the
bows
of
her
ships
and
waited
for
the
enemy
to
approach
when
they
were
within
a
few
hundred
she
took
from
her
girdle
the
jewel
of
the
ebbing
tide
and
cast
the
flashing
gem
into
the
sea
it
blazed
in
the
air
for
a
moment
but
no
sooner
did
it
touch
the
water
than
instantly
the
ocean
receded
from
under
the
corean
vessels
and
left
them
stranded
on
dry
land
the
coreans
thinking
it
was
a
tidal
wave
and
that
the
japanese
ships
were
likewise
helpless
in
the
undertow
leaped
out
of
their
galleys
and
rushed
over
the
sand
and
on
to
the
attack
with
shouting
and
drawn
swords
their
aspect
was
terrible
when
within
range
of
the
arrows
the
japanese
bowmen
opened
volleys
of
or
arrows
on
the
coreans
and
killed
hundreds
but
on
they
rushed
until
near
the
japanese
ships
when
the
empress
taking
out
the
jewel
cast
it
in
the
sea
in
a
snap
of
the
finger
the
ocean
rolled
up
into
a
wave
many
tens
of
feet
high
and
engulfed
the
corean
army
drowning
them
almost
to
a
man
only
a
few
were
left
out
of
the
ten
thousand
the
warriors
in
their
iron
armor
sank
dead
in
the
boiling
waves
or
were
cast
along
the
shore
like
logs
the
japanese
army
landed
safely
and
easily
conquered
the
country
the
king
of
corea
surrendered
and
gave
his
bales
of
silk
jewels
mirrors
books
pictures
robes
tiger
skins
and
treasures
of
gold
and
silver
to
the
empress
the
booty
was
loaded
on
eighty
ships
and
the
japanese
army
returned
in
triumph
to
their
native
country
kai
riu
o
the
dragon
king
of
the
world
under
the
sea
soon
after
her
arrival
at
home
the
empress
jingu
gave
birth
to
a
son
whom
she
named
ojin
he
was
one
of
the
fairest
children
ever
born
of
an
imperial
mother
and
was
very
wise
and
wonderful
even
when
an
infant
he
was
a
great
favorite
of
takénouchi
the
prime
minister
of
the
empress
as
he
grew
up
he
was
full
of
the
or
the
spirit
of
unconquerable
japan
this
takénouchi
was
a
very
venerable
old
man
who
was
said
to
be
three
hundred
and
sixty
years
old
he
had
been
the
counsellor
of
five
mikados
he
was
very
tall
and
as
straight
as
an
arrow
when
other
old
men
were
bent
like
a
bow
he
served
as
a
general
in
war
and
a
civil
officer
in
peace
for
this
reason
he
always
kept
on
a
suit
of
armor
under
his
long
satin
and
damask
court
robes
he
wore
the
shoes
and
the
scabbard
which
were
the
general
badge
of
rank
and
also
the
high
cap
and
long
fringed
strap
hanging
from
the
belt
which
marked
the
court
noble
he
had
moustaches
and
a
long
beard
fell
over
his
breast
like
a
foaming
waterfall
as
white
as
the
snows
on
the
branches
of
the
pine
trees
of
ibuki
mountain
now
the
empress
as
well
as
takénouchi
wished
the
imperial
infant
ojin
to
live
long
be
wise
and
powerful
become
a
mighty
warrior
be
invulnerable
in
battle
and
to
have
control
over
the
tides
and
the
ocean
as
his
mother
once
had
to
do
this
it
was
necessary
to
get
back
the
tide
jewels
so
takénouchi
took
the
infant
ojin
on
his
shoulders
mounted
the
imperial
whose
sails
were
of
silk
and
bade
his
rowers
put
out
to
sea
then
standing
upright
on
the
deck
he
called
on
kai
riu
o
to
come
up
out
of
the
deep
and
give
back
the
tide
jewels
to
ojin
at
first
there
was
no
sign
on
the
waves
that
kai
riu
o
heard
the
green
sea
lay
glassy
in
the
sunlight
and
the
waves
laughed
and
curled
above
the
sides
of
the
boat
still
takénouchi
listened
intently
and
waited
reverently
he
was
not
long
in
suspense
looking
down
far
under
the
sparkling
waves
he
saw
the
head
and
fiery
eyes
of
a
dragon
mounting
upward
instinctively
he
clutched
his
robe
with
his
right
hand
and
held
ojin
tightly
on
his
shoulder
for
this
time
not
isora
but
the
terrible
kai
riu
o
himself
was
coming
what
a
great
honor
the
servant
isora
had
appeared
to
a
woman
the
empress
jingu
but
to
her
son
the
dragon
king
of
the
world
under
the
sea
deigned
to
come
in
person
the
waters
opened
the
waves
rolled
up
curled
rolled
into
wreaths
and
hooks
and
drops
of
foam
which
flecked
the
dark
green
curves
with
silvery
bells
first
appeared
a
living
dragon
with
eyes
long
flickering
moustaches
glittering
scales
of
green
all
ruffled
with
terrible
spines
erect
and
the
joints
of
the
curling
out
jets
of
red
fire
this
living
creature
was
the
helmet
of
the
sea
king
next
appeared
the
face
of
awful
majesty
and
stern
mien
as
if
with
reluctant
condescension
and
then
the
jewel
robes
of
the
monarch
next
rose
into
view
a
huge
haliotis
shell
in
which
on
a
bed
of
rare
gems
from
the
deep
sea
floor
glistened
blazed
and
flashed
the
two
jewels
of
the
tides
then
the
spoke
saying
quick
take
this
casket
i
deign
not
to
remain
long
in
this
upper
world
of
mortals
with
these
i
endow
the
imperial
prince
of
the
heavenly
line
of
the
mikados
of
the
divine
country
he
shall
be
invulnerable
in
battle
he
shall
have
long
life
to
him
i
give
power
over
sea
and
land
of
this
let
these
be
the
token
hardly
were
these
words
uttered
when
the
disappeared
with
a
tremendous
splash
takénouchi
standing
erect
but
breathless
amid
the
crowd
of
rowers
who
crouching
at
the
boat
bottom
had
not
dared
so
much
as
to
lift
up
their
noses
waited
a
moment
and
then
gave
the
command
to
turn
the
prow
to
the
shore
ojin
grew
up
and
became
a
great
warrior
invincible
in
battle
and
powerful
in
peace
he
lived
to
be
one
hundred
and
eleven
years
old
and
was
next
to
the
last
of
the
long
lived
mikados
of
everlasting
great
japan
to
this
day
japanese
soldiers
honor
him
as
the
patron
of
war
and
pray
to
him
as
the
ruler
of
battle
when
the
buddhist
priests
came
to
japan
they
changed
his
name
to
hachiman
dai
bosatsu
or
the
great
buddha
of
the
eight
banners
on
many
a
hill
and
in
many
a
village
of
japan
may
still
be
seen
a
shrine
to
his
honor
often
when
a
soldier
comes
back
from
war
he
will
hang
up
a
tablet
or
on
which
is
carved
a
painting
or
picture
of
the
short
sword
like
that
which
ojin
carried
many
of
the
old
soldiers
who
fought
in
armor
wore
a
little
silver
sword
of
ojin
set
as
a
frontlet
to
their
helmets
for
a
crest
of
honor
on
gilded
or
lacquered
japanese
cabinets
and
shrines
and
printed
on
their
curious
old
and
new
greenback
paper
money
are
seen
the
blazing
jewels
of
the
tides
on
their
gold
and
silver
coins
the
coiled

in
his
claws
the
jewels

of
the

on
which
floats
proudly
the

is
named
kōgō
empress
after
the
amazon
empress
who
in
the
third
century
carried
the
arms
of
the
island
empire
into
the
main
land
of
asia
and
won
victory
by
her
mastery
over
the
ebbing
and
the
flowing
tides
illustration
the
dragon
king
gift
of
the
tide
jewels
the
creation
of
heaven
and
earth
of
old
the
heavens
and
the
earth
were
not
separated
land
and
water
solids
and
gases
fire
and
stone
light
and
darkness
were
mixed
together
all
was
liquid
and
turbid
chaos
then
the
mighty
mass
began
to
move
from
within
the
lighter
particles
of
gas
and
air
began
to
rise
forming
the
sky
and
heavens
the
heavy
parts
sank
and
cohered
becoming
the
earth
the
water
formed
the
four
seas
then
there
appeared
something
like
a
white
cloud
floating
between
heaven
and
earth
out
of
this
came
forth
three
beings
the
being
of
the
middle
of
heaven
the
high
august
being
and
the
majestic
being
these
three
hid
their
bodies
out
of
the
warm
mould
of
the
earth
something
like
a
rush
sprouted
up
it
was
clear
and
bright
like
crystal
from
this
came
forth
a
being
whose
title
is
the
delightful
and
honorable
next
appeared
another
being
out
of
the
buds
of
the
whose
name
is
the
honorable
these
five
beings
are
called
the
heavenly
gods
next
came
into
existence
four
pairs
of
beings
viz
the
being
sprung
from
the
first
mud
and
the
being
of
the
sand
and
mud
the
being
with
hands
and
feet
growing
and
the
being
having
breath
the
male
being
and
the
female
being
of
the
great
place
the
earth
the
being
of
complete
perfection
and
the
being
who
cried
out
strange
and
awful
to
her
mate
thus
the
last
pair
that
came
into
existence
were
the
first
man
and
woman
called
izanagi
and
izanami
it
is
said
that
the
other
pairs
of
beings
before
izanagi
and
izanami
were
only
their
imperfect
forms
or
the
processes
through
which
they
passed
before
arriving
at
perfection
these
two
beings
lived
in
the
heavens
the
world
was
not
yet
well
formed
and
the
soil
floated
about
like
a
fish
in
the
water
but
near
the
surface
and
was
called
the
floating
region
the
sun
earth
and
moon
were
still
attached
to
each
other
like
a
head
to
the
neck
or
arms
to
the
body
they
were
little
by
little
separating
the
parts
joining
them
growing
thinner
and
thinner
this
part
like
an
isthmus
was
called
heaven
floating
bridge
it
was
on
this
bridge
that
izanagi
and
izanami
were
standing
when
they
saw
a
pair
of
wagtails
cooing
and
billing
sweetly
together
the
heavenly
couple
were
so
delighted
with
the
sight
that
they
began
to
imitate
the
birds
thus
began
the
art
of
love
which
mortals
have
practiced
to
this
day
while
talking
together
on
this
bridge
of
heaven
they
began
to
wonder
if
there
was
a
world
beneath
them
they
looked
far
down
upon
the
green
seas
but
could
see
nothing
then
izanagi
took
his
long
jeweled
spear
and
plunged
it
into
the
turbid
mass
turning
it
round
and
round
as
he
lifted
it
up
the
drops
which
trickled
from
it
hardened
into
earth
of
their
own
accord
and
thus
dry
land
was
formed
as
izanagi
was
cleansing
his
spear
the
lumps
of
muck
and
mud
which
had
adhered
to
it
flew
off
into
space
and
were
changed
into
stars
and
comets
it
is
said
that
by
turning
his
spear
round
and
round
izanagi
set
the
earth
revolving
in
daily
revolutions
to
the
land
thus
formed
they
gave
the
name
of
the
island
of
the
congealed
drop
because
they
intended
to
create
a
large
archipelago
and
wished
to
distinguish
this
as
the
first
island
they
descended
from
heaven
on
the
floating
bridge
and
landed
on
the
island
izanagi
struck
his
tall
spear
in
the
ground
making
it
the
axis
of
the
world
he
then
proceeded
to
build
a
palace
around
the
spear
which
formed
the
central
pillar
this
spot
was
formerly
at
the
north
pole
but
is
now
at
eshima
off
the
central
eastern
coast
of
japan
they
then
resolved
to
walk
round
the
island
and
examine
it
this
done
they
met
together
izanami
cried
out
what
a
lovely
man
but
izanagi
rebuked
her
for
speaking
first
and
said
they
must
try
it
again
then
they
walked
round
the
island
once
more
when
they
met
izanami
held
her
tongue
while
izanagi
said
what
a
lovely
woman
being
now
both
in
good
humor
they
began
the
work
of
creating
japan
the
first
island
brought
up
out
of
the
water
was
awaji
and
then
the
main
island
after
that
eight
large
islands
were
created
whence
comes
one
of
the
names
of
japan
the
empire
of
the
eight
great
islands
six
smaller
islands
were
also
produced
the
several
thousand
islets
which
make
up
the
archipelago
of
everlasting
great
japan
were
formed
by
the
spontaneous
consolidation
of
the
foam
of
the
sea
after
the
country
was
thus
formed
the
divine
pair
created
eight
millions
of
earthly
gods
or
kami
and
the
ten
thousand
different
things
on
the
earth
vegetation
sprang
up
over
all
the
land
which
was
however
still
covered
with
mist
so
izanagi
created
with
his
breath
the
two
gods
male
and
female
of
the
wind
all
these
islands
are
the
children
of
izanagi
and
izanami
and
when
first
born
were
small
and
feeble
but
gradually
grew
larger
and
larger
attaining
their
present
size
like
human
beings
which
are
at
first
tiny
infants
as
the
gradual
separation
of
the
land
and
sea
went
on
foreign
countries
were
formed
by
the
congealing
of
the
foam
of
the
sea
the
god
of
fire
was
then
born
of
izanami
his
mother
this
god
often
got
very
angry
at
any
one
who
used
unclean
fire
izanami
then
created
by
herself
the
gods
of
metals
of
clay
and
of
fresh
water
this
latter
was
told
always
to
keep
the
god
of
fire
quiet
and
put
him
out
when
he
began
to
do
mischief
izanagi
and
izanami
though
married
but
a
short
time
began
to
quarrel
for
izanami
had
once
told
her
husband
not
to
look
at
her
when
she
hid
herself
but
izanagi
did
not
do
what
she
requested
but
intruded
on
her
privacy
when
she
was
unwell
and
stared
at
her
when
she
wished
to
be
alone
izanami
then
got
very
angry
and
went
down
to
the
lower
world
of
darkness
and
disappeared
in
the
dark
world
under
the
earth
izanami
stayed
a
long
time
and
after
long
waiting
izanagi
went
after
her
in
the
darkness
of
the
he
was
horrified
at
what
he
saw
and
leaving
his
consort
below
tried
to
escape
to
the
earth
again
in
his
struggles
several
gods
were
created
one
of
them
coming
out
of
his
staff
when
he
got
up
to
daylight
he
secured
a
large
rock
to
close
up
the
hole
in
the
earth
turning
this
rock
into
a
god
he
commanded
him
to
watch
the
place
he
then
rushed
into
the
sea
and
continued
washing
for
a
long
time
to
purify
himself
in
blowing
out
from
his
lungs
the
polluted
air
inhaled
in
the
the
two
evil
gods
sprang
forth
from
his
breath
as
these
would
commit
great
harm
and
wickedness
izanagi
created
two
other
gods
to
correct
their
evil
but
when
he
had
washed
his
eyes
and
could
see
clearly
again
there
sprang
out
two
precious
and
lovely
beings
one
from
his
left
eye
being
a
rare
and
glistening
maiden
whom
he
afterwards
named
ama
térasu
or
the
heaven
illuminating
spirit
from
his
right
eye
appeared
susa
no
o
the
ruler
of
the
moon
being
now
pure
again
and
having
these
lovely
children
izanagi
rejoiced
and
said
i
have
begotten
child
upon
child
and
at
the
end
of
my
begetting
i
have
begotten
me
two
now
the
brightness
of
the
person
of
the
maiden
ama
térasu
was
beautiful
and
shone
through
heaven
and
earth
izanagi
well
pleased
said
though
my
children
are
many
none
of
them
is
like
this
she
must
not
be
kept
in
this
region
so
taking
off
the
necklace
of
precious
stones
from
his
neck
and
rattling
it
he
gave
it
to
her
saying
rule
thou
over
the
high
plain
of
heaven
at
that
time
the
distance
between
heaven
and
earth
was
not
very
great
and
he
sent
her
up
to
the
blue
sky
by
the
pillar
on
which
the
heavens
rested
like
a
prop
she
easily
mounted
it
and
lived
in
the
sun
illuminating
the
whole
heavens
and
the
earth
the
sun
now
gradually
separated
from
the
earth
and
both
moved
farther
and
farther
apart
until
they
rested
where
they
now
are
izanagi
next
spoke
to
susa
no
o
the
ruler
of
the
moon
and
said
rule
thou
over
the
earth
and
the
blue
waste
of
the
sea
with
its
multitudinous
salt
waters
so
then
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
moon
were
created
and
inhabited
and
as
japan
lay
directly
opposite
the
sun
when
it
separated
from
the
earth
it
is
plain
that
japan
lies
on
the
summit
of
the
globe
it
is
easily
seen
that
all
other
countries
were
formed
by
the
spontaneous
consolidation
of
the
ocean
foam
and
the
collection
of
mud
in
the
various
seas
the
stars
were
made
to
guide
warriors
from
foreign
countries
to
the
court
of
the
mikado
who
is
the
true
son
of
heaven
how
the
sun
goddess
was
enticed
out
of
her
cave
when
the
goddess
on
account
of
the
evil
pranks
of
her
brother
susa
no
o
the
ruler
of
the
moon
hid
herself
in
a
cave
there
was
no
more
light
and
heaven
and
earth
were
plunged
into
darkness
a
council
of
all
the
gods
was
held
in
the
dry
bed
of
one
of
the
rivers
which
we
call
the
milky
way
in
the
fields
of
heaven
the
question
of
how
to
appease
the
anger
of
the
goddess
was
discussed
a
and
very
wise
god
was
ordered
to
think
out
a
plan
to
entice
her
forth
from
the
cave
after
due
deliberation
it
was
resolved
that
a
should
be
made
to
tempt
her
to
gaze
at
herself
and
that
tricks
should
be
played
to
arouse
her
curiosity
to
come
out
and
see
what
was
going
on
so
setting
to
work
with
a
will
the
gods
forged
and
polished
a
mirror
wove
cloth
for
beautiful
garments
built
a
pavilion
carved
a
necklace
of
jewels
made
wands
and
tried
an
augury
all
being
ready
the
fat
and
goddess
of
mirth
with
face
full
of
dimples
and
eyes
full
of
fun
named
uzumé
was
selected
to
lead
the
dance
she
had
a
flute
made
from
a
bamboo
cane
by
piercing
holes
between
the
joints
while
every
god
in
the
great
orchestra
had
a
pair
of
flat
hard
wood
clappers
which
he
struck
together
she
bound
up
her
long
flowing
sleeves
with
a
creeper
vine
and
made
for
herself
a
baton
of
twigs
of
bamboo
grass
by
which
she
could
direct
the
motions
of
the
musicians
this
she
held
in
one
hand
while
in
the
other
was
a
spear
wound
round
with
grass
on
which
small
bells
tinkled
great
bonfires
were
lighted
in
front
of
the
cave
so
that
the
audience
of
gods
could
see
the
dance
a
large
circular
box
which
resounded
like
a
drum
when
trod
on
was
set
up
for
uzumé
to
dance
upon
the
row
of
cocks
now
began
to
crow
in
concert
all
being
ready
the
god
who
was
to
pull
the
out
of
the
cave
as
soon
as
overcome
by
her
curiosity
she
should
peep
forth
hid
himself
beside
the
stone
door
of
the
cave
uzumé
mounted
the
box
and
began
to
dance
as
the
resounded
the
spirit
of
folly
seized
her
and
she
began
to
chant
a
song
becoming
still
more
foolish
uzumé
waved
her
wand
wildly
loosened
her
dress
and
danced
till
she
had
not
a
stitch
of
clothing
left
on
her
the
gods
were
so
amused
at
her
foolishness
that
they
all
laughed
until
the
heavens
shook
as
with
claps
of
thunder
the
within
the
cave
heard
all
these
strange
noises
the
crowing
of
the
cocks
the
hammering
on
the
anvil
the
chopping
of
wood
the
music
of
the
koto
the
clappering
of
the
hard
wood
the
tinkling
of
the
bells
the
shouting
of
uzumé
and
the
boisterous
laughter
of
the
gods
wondering
what
it
all
meant
she
peeped
out
as
she
did
so
the
doubly
beautiful
goddess
held
up
the
mirror
the
one
seeing
her
own
face
in
it
was
greatly
astonished
curiosity
got
the
better
of
fear
she
looked
far
out
instantly
the
god
pulled
the
rocky
door
open
and
seizing
her
hand
dragged
her
forth
then
all
the
heavens
and
earth
were
lightened
the
trees
and
grass
became
green
again
and
the
goddess
of
colors
resumed
her
work
of
tinting
the
flowers
the
gloom
fled
from
all
eyes
and
human
beings
again
became
thus
the
calamity
which
had
befallen
heaven
and
earth
by
the
hiding
in
the
cave
became
a
means
of
much
benefit
to
mortals
for
by
their
necessity
the
gods
were
compelled
to
invent
the
arts
of
weaving
carpentry
jeweling
and
many
other
useful
appliances
for
the
human
race
they
also
on
this
occasion
first
made
use
of
music
dancing
the
dai
kagura
the
comedy
which
makes
the
gods
laugh
and
