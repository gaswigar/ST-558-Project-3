i
through

you
stars
alone
in

night
on
a
dark
hill
with
pines
around
me
spicy
and
still
and
a
heaven
full
of
stars
over
my
head
white
and
topaz
and
misty
red
myriads
with
beating
hearts
of
fire
that
aeons
can
not
vex
or
tire
up
the
dome
of
heaven
like
a
great
hill
i
watch
them
marching
stately
and
still
and
i
know
that
i
am
honored
to
be
witness
of
so
much
majesty
what
do
i
care
what
do
i
care
in
the
dreams
and
the
languor
of
spring
that
my
songs
do
not
show
me
at
all
for
they
are
a
fragrance
and
i
am
a
flint
and
a
fire
i
am
an
answer
they
are
only
a
call
but
what
do
i
care
for
love
will
be
over
so
soon
let
my
heart
have
its
say
and
my
mind
stand
idly
by
for
my
mind
is
proud
and
strong
enough
to
be
silent
it
is
my
heart
that
makes
my
songs
not
meadowlarks
in
the
silver
light
after
a
storm
under
dripping
boughs
of
bright
new
green
i
take
the
low
path
to
hear
the
meadowlarks
alone
and
as
if
i
were
a
queen
what
have
i
to
fear
in
life
or
death
who
have
known
three
things
the
kiss
in
the
night
the
white
flying
joy
when
a
song
is
born
and
meadowlarks
whistling
in
silver
light
driftwood
my
forefathers
gave
me
my
spirit
shaken
flame
the
shape
of
hands
the
beat
of
heart
the
letters
of
my
name
but
it
was
my
lovers
and
not
my
sleeping
sires
who
gave
the
flame
its
changeful
and
iridescent
fires
as
the
driftwood
burning
learned
its
jewelled
blaze
from
the
sea
blue
splendor
of
colored
nights
and
days
i
have
loved
hours
at
sea
i
have
loved
hours
at
sea
gray
cities
the
fragile
secret
of
a
flower
music
the
making
of
a
poem
that
gave
me
heaven
for
an
hour
first
stars
above
a
snowy
hill
voices
of
people
kindly
and
wise
and
the
great
look
of
love
long
hidden
found
at
last
in
meeting
eyes
i
have
loved
much
and
been
loved
deeply
oh
when
my
spirit
fire
burns
low
leave
me
the
darkness
and
the
stillness
i
shall
be
tired
and
glad
to
go
august
moonrise
the
sun
was
gone
and
the
moon
was
coming
over
the
blue
connecticut
hills
the
west
was
rosy
the
east
was
flushed
and
over
my
head
the
swallows
rushed
this
way
and
that
with
changeful
wills
i
heard
them
twitter
and
watched
them
dart
now
together
and
now
apart
like
dark
petals
blown
from
a
tree
the
maples
stamped
against
the
west
were
black
and
stately
and
full
of
rest
and
the
hazy
orange
moon
grew
up
and
slowly
changed
to
yellow
gold
while
the
hills
were
darkened
fold
on
fold
to
a
deeper
blue
than
a
flower
could
hold
down
the
hill
i
went
and
then
i
forgot
the
ways
of
men
for
heady
and
damp
and
cool
wakened
ecstasy
in
me
on
the
brink
of
a
shining
pool
o
beauty
out
of
many
a
cup
you
have
made
me
drunk
and
wild
ever
since
i
was
a
child
but
when
have
i
been
sure
as
now
that
no
bitterness
can
bend
and
no
sorrow
wholly
bow
one
who
loves
you
to
the
end
and
though
i
must
give
my
breath
and
my
laughter
all
to
death
and
my
eyes
through
which
joy
came
and
my
heart
a
wavering
flame
if
all
must
leave
me
and
go
back
along
a
blind
and
fearful
track
so
that
you
can
make
anew
fusing
with
intenser
fire
something
nearer
your
desire
if
my
soul
must
go
alone
through
a
cold
infinity
or
even
if
it
vanish
too
beauty
i
have
worshipped
you
let
this
single
hour
atone
for
the
theft
of
all
of
me
memories
ii
places
places
i
love
come
back
to
me
like
music
hush
me
and
heal
me
when
i
am
very
tired
i
see
the
oak
woods
at
saxton
flaming
in
a
flare
of
crimson
by
the
frost
newly
fired
and
i
am
thirsty
for
the
spring
in
the
valley
as
for
a
kiss
ungiven
and
long
desired
i
know
a
bright
world
of
snowy
hills
at
boonton
a
blue
and
white
dazzling
light
on
everything
one
sees
the
branches
of
the
hemlocks
sparkle
bending
low
and
tinkling
in
the
sharp
thin
breeze
and
iridescent
crystals
fall
and
crackle
on
the
with
the
winter
sun
drawing
cold
blue
shadows
from
the
trees
violet
now
in
veil
on
veil
of
evening
the
hills
across
from
cromwell
grow
dreamy
and
far
a
is
singing
soft
as
a
viol
in
the
heart
of
the
hollow
where
the
dark
pools
are
the
primrose
has
opened
her
pale
yellow
flowers
and
heaven
is
lighting
star
after
star
places
i
love
come
back
to
me
like
music
midnight
the
waves
buzz
drowsily
in
the
ship
deep
churning
the
eerie
phosphorescence
is
like
the
souls
of
people
who
were
drowned
at
sea
and
i
can
hear
a
man
voice
speaking
hushed
insistent
at
midnight
in
hour
on
hour
to
me
old
tunes
as
the
waves
of
perfume
heliotrope
rose
float
in
the
garden
when
no
wind
blows
come
to
us
go
from
us
whence
no
one
knows
so
the
old
tunes
float
in
my
mind
and
go
from
me
leaving
no
trace
behind
like
fragrance
borne
on
the
hush
of
the
wind
but
in
the
instant
the
airs
remain
i
know
the
laughter
and
the
pain
of
times
that
will
not
come
again
i
try
to
catch
at
many
a
tune
like
petals
of
light
fallen
from
the
moon
broken
and
bright
on
a
dark
lagoon
but
they
float
away
for
who
can
hold
youth
or
perfume
or
the
moon
gold
only
in
sleep
only
in
sleep
i
see
their
faces
children
i
played
with
when
i
was
a
child
louise
comes
back
with
her
brown
hair
braided
annie
with
ringlets
warm
and
wild
only
in
sleep
time
is
forgotten
what
may
have
come
to
them
who
can
know
yet
we
played
last
night
as
long
ago
and
the
stood
at
the
turn
of
the
stair
the
years
had
not
sharpened
their
smooth
round
faces
i
met
their
eyes
and
found
them
mild
do
they
too
dream
of
me
i
wonder
and
for
them
am
i
too
a
child
redbirds
redbirds
redbirds
long
and
long
ago
what
a
you
had
in
hills
i
used
to
know
redbud
buckberry
wild
and
proud
river
sweeping
southward
to
the
sea
brown
and
gold
in
the
sun
sparkling
far
below
trailing
stately
round
her
bluffs
where
the
poplars
grow
redbirds
redbirds
are
you
singing
still
as
you
sang
one
may
day
on
saxton
hill
sunset
louis
hushed
in
the
smoky
haze
of
summer
sunset
when
i
came
home
again
from
places
how
many
times
i
saw
my
western
city
dream
by
her
river
then
for
an
hour
the
water
wore
a
mantle
of
tawny
gold
and
mauve
and
misted
turquoise
under
the
tall
and
darkened
arches
bearing
gray
bridges
against
the
sunset
and
steeples
flickered
with
fire
up
the
slope
to
westward
and
old
warehouses
poured
their
purple
shadows
across
the
levee
high
over
them
the
black
train
swept
with
thunder
cleaving
the
city
leaving
far
beneath
it
moored
beside
the
old
resting
in
twilight
the
coin
into
my
heart
treasury
i
slipped
a
coin
that
time
can
not
take
nor
a
thief
purloin
oh
better
than
the
minting
of
a
king
is
the
memory
of
a
lovely
thing
the
voice
atoms
as
old
as
stars
mutation
on
mutation
millions
and
millions
of
cells
dividing
yet
still
the
same
from
air
and
changing
earth
from
ancient
eastern
rivers
from
turquoise
tropic
seas
unto
myself
i
came
my
spirit
like
my
flesh
sprang
from
a
thousand
sources
from
hunter
and
shepherd
from
karnak
cyprus
rome
the
living
thoughts
in
me
spring
from
dead
men
and
women
forgotten
time
out
of
mind
and
many
as
bubbles
of
foam
here
for
a
moment
space
into
the
light
out
of
darkness
i
come
and
they
come
with
me
finding
words
with
my
breath
from
the
wisdom
of
many
i
hear
them
cry
forever
seek
for
beauty
she
only
fights
with
man
against
death
iii
day
and
night
in
warsaw
in
poland
half
the
world
away
the
one
i
love
best
of
all
thought
of
me
i
know
for
i
went
winged
as
a
bird
in
the
wide
flowing
wind
his
own
voice
i
heard
his
arms
were
round
me
in
a
ferny
place
i
looked
in
the
pool
and
there
was
his
face
but
now
it
is
night
and
the
cold
stars
say
warsaw
in
poland
is
half
the
world
away
compensation
i
should
be
glad
of
loneliness
and
hours
that
go
on
broken
wings
a
thirsty
body
a
tired
heart
and
the
unchanging
ache
of
things
if
i
could
make
a
single
song
as
lovely
and
as
full
of
light
as
hushed
and
brief
as
a
falling
star
on
a
winter
night
i
remembered
there
never
was
a
mood
of
mine
gay
or
luminous
or
dull
but
you
could
ease
me
of
its
fever
and
give
it
back
to
me
more
beautiful
in
many
another
soul
i
broke
the
bread
and
drank
the
wine
and
played
the
happy
guest
but
i
was
lonely
i
remembered
you
the
heart
belongs
to
him
who
knew
it
best
oh
you
are
coming
oh
you
are
coming
coming
coming
how
will
hungry
time
put
by
the
hours
till
then
but
why
does
it
anger
my
heart
to
long
so
for
one
man
out
of
the
world
of
men
oh
i
would
live
in
myself
only
and
build
my
life
lightly
and
still
as
a
dream
are
not
my
thoughts
clearer
than
your
thoughts
and
colored
like
stones
in
a
running
stream
now
the
slow
moon
brightens
in
heaven
the
stars
are
ready
the
night
is
here
oh
why
must
i
lose
myself
to
love
you
my
dear
the
return
he
has
come
he
is
here
my
love
has
come
home
the
minutes
are
lighter
than
flying
foam
the
hours
are
like
dancers
on
feet
the
days
are
young
runners
naked
and
fleet
for
my
love
has
returned
he
is
home
he
is
here
in
the
whole
world
no
other
is
dear
as
my
dear
gray
eyes
it
was
april
when
you
came
the
first
time
to
me
and
my
first
look
in
your
eyes
was
like
my
first
look
at
the
sea
we
have
been
together
four
aprils
now
watching
for
the
green
on
the
swaying
willow
bough
yet
whenever
i
turn
to
your
gray
eyes
over
me
it
is
as
though
i
looked
for
the
first
time
at
the
sea
the
net
i
made
you
many
and
many
a
song
yet
never
one
told
all
you
are
it
was
as
though
a
net
of
words
were
flung
to
catch
a
star
it
was
as
though
i
curved
my
hand
and
dipped
eagerly
only
to
find
it
lost
the
blue
dark
splendor
of
the
sea
the
mystery
your
eyes
drink
of
me
love
makes
them
shine
your
eyes
that
lean
so
close
to
mine
we
have
long
been
lovers
we
know
the
range
of
each
other
moods
and
how
they
change
but
when
we
look
at
each
other
so
then
we
feel
how
little
we
know
the
spirit
eludes
us
timid
and
free
can
i
ever
know
you
or
you
know
me
in
a
hospital
iv
open
windows
out
of
the
window
a
sea
of
green
trees
lift
their
soft
boughs
like
the
arms
of
a
dancer
they
beckon
and
call
me
come
out
in
the
sun
but
i
can
not
answer
i
am
alone
with
weakness
and
pain
sick
abed
and
june
is
going
i
can
not
keep
her
she
hurries
by
with
the
of
her
garments
blowing
men
and
women
pass
in
the
street
glad
of
the
shining
sapphire
weather
but
we
know
more
of
it
than
they
pain
and
i
together
they
are
the
runners
in
the
sun
breathless
and
blinded
by
the
race
but
we
are
watchers
in
the
shade
who
speak
with
wonder
face
to
face
the
new
moon
day
you
have
bruised
and
beaten
me
as
rain
beats
down
the
bright
proud
sea
beaten
my
body
bruised
my
soul
left
me
nothing
lovely
or
whole
yet
i
have
wrested
a
gift
from
you
day
that
dies
in
dusky
blue
for
suddenly
over
the
factories
i
saw
a
moon
in
the
cloudy
seas
a
wisp
of
beauty
all
alone
in
a
world
as
hard
and
gray
as
stone
oh
who
could
be
bitter
and
want
to
die
when
a
maiden
moon
wakes
up
in
the
sky
eight
supper
comes
at
five
at
six
the
evening
star
my
lover
comes
at
eight
but
eight
is
far
how
could
i
bear
my
pain
all
day
unless
i
watched
to
see
the
laboring
to
bring
eight
to
me
lost
things
oh
i
could
let
the
world
go
by
its
loud
new
wonders
and
its
wars
but
how
will
i
give
up
the
sky
when
winter
dusk
is
set
with
stars
and
i
could
let
the
cities
go
their
changing
customs
and
their
creeds
but
oh
the
summer
rains
that
blow
in
silver
on
the
pain
waves
are
the
sea
white
daughters
and
raindrops
the
children
of
rain
but
why
for
my
shimmering
body
have
i
a
mother
like
pain
night
is
the
mother
of
stars
and
wind
the
mother
of
foam
the
world
is
brimming
with
beauty
but
i
must
stay
at
home
the
broken
field
my
soul
is
a
dark
ploughed
field
in
the
cold
rain
my
soul
is
a
broken
field
ploughed
by
pain
where
grass
and
bending
flowers
were
growing
the
field
lies
broken
now
for
another
sowing
great
sower
when
you
tread
my
field
again
scatter
the
furrows
there
with
better
grain
the
unseen
death
went
up
the
hall
unseen
by
every
one
trailing
twilight
robes
past
the
nurse
and
the
nun
he
paused
at
every
door
and
listened
to
the
breath
of
those
who
did
not
know
how
near
they
were
to
death
death
went
up
the
hall
unseen
by
nurse
and
nun
he
passed
by
many
a
door
but
he
entered
one
a
prayer
when
i
am
dying
let
me
know
that
i
loved
the
blowing
snow
although
it
stung
like
whips
that
i
loved
all
lovely
things
and
i
tried
to
take
their
stings
with
gay
unembittered
lips
that
i
loved
with
all
my
strength
to
my
soul
full
depth
and
length
careless
if
my
heart
must
break
that
i
sang
as
children
sing
fitting
tunes
to
everything
loving
life
for
its
own
sake
v
spring
torrents
will
it
always
be
like
this
until
i
am
dead
every
spring
must
i
bear
it
all
again
with
the
first
red
haze
of
the
budding
maple
boughs
and
the
first
rain
oh
i
am
like
a
rock
in
the
rising
river
where
the
flooded
water
breaks
with
a
low
call
like
a
rock
that
knows
the
cry
of
the
waters
and
can
not
answer
at
all
i
know
the
stars
i
know
the
stars
by
their
names
aldebaran
altair
and
i
know
the
path
they
take
up
heaven
broad
blue
stair
i
know
the
secrets
of
men
by
the
look
of
their
eyes
their
gray
thoughts
their
strange
thoughts
have
made
me
sad
and
wise
but
your
eyes
are
dark
to
me
though
they
seem
to
call
and
call
i
can
not
tell
if
you
love
me
or
do
not
love
me
at
all
i
know
many
things
but
the
years
come
and
go
i
shall
die
not
knowing
the
thing
i
long
to
know
understanding
i
understood
the
rest
too
well
and
all
their
thoughts
have
come
to
be
clear
as
grey
in
the
swell
of
a
sunny
shallow
sea
but
you
i
never
understood
your
spirit
secret
hides
like
gold
sunk
in
a
spanish
galleon
ages
ago
in
waters
cold
nightfall
we
will
never
walk
again
as
we
used
to
walk
at
night
watching
our
shadows
lengthen
under
the
gold
when
the
snow
was
new
and
white
we
will
never
walk
again
slowly
we
two
in
spring
when
the
park
is
sweet
with
midnight
and
with
dew
and
the
are
few
i
sit
and
think
of
it
all
and
the
blue
june
twilight
dies
down
in
the
clanging
square
a
cries
and
stars
come
out
in
the
skies
it
is
not
a
word
it
is
not
a
word
spoken
few
words
are
said
nor
even
a
look
of
the
eyes
nor
a
bend
of
the
head
but
only
a
hush
of
the
heart
that
has
too
much
to
keep
only
memories
waking
that
sleep
so
light
a
sleep
my
heart
is
heavy
my
heart
is
heavy
with
many
a
song
like
ripe
fruit
bearing
down
the
tree
but
i
can
never
give
you
one
my
songs
do
not
belong
to
me
yet
in
the
evening
in
the
dusk
when
moths
go
to
and
fro
in
the
gray
hour
if
the
fruit
has
fallen
take
it
no
one
will
know
the
nights
remember
the
days
remember
and
the
nights
remember
the
kingly
hours
that
once
you
made
so
great
deep
in
my
heart
they
lie
hidden
in
their
splendor
buried
like
sovereigns
in
their
robes
of
state
let
them
not
wake
again
better
to
lie
there
wrapped
in
memories
jewelled
and
arrayed
many
a
ghostly
king
has
waked
from
and
found
his
crown
stolen
and
his
throne
decayed
let
it
be
forgotten
let
it
be
forgotten
as
a
flower
is
forgotten
forgotten
as
a
fire
that
once
was
singing
gold
let
it
be
forgotten
for
ever
and
ever
time
is
a
kind
friend
he
will
make
us
old
if
anyone
asks
say
it
was
forgotten
long
and
long
ago
as
a
flower
as
a
fire
as
a
hushed
footfall
in
a
long
forgotten
snow
the
dark
cup
vi
may
day
a
delicate
fabric
of
bird
song
floats
in
the
air
the
smell
of
wet
wild
earth
is
everywhere
red
small
leaves
of
the
maple
are
clenched
like
a
hand
like
girls
at
their
first
communion
the
pear
trees
stand
oh
i
must
pass
nothing
by
without
loving
it
much
the
raindrop
try
with
my
lips
the
grass
with
my
touch
for
how
can
i
be
sure
i
shall
see
again
the
world
on
the
first
of
may
shining
after
the
rain
since
there
is
no
escape
since
there
is
no
escape
since
at
the
end
my
body
will
be
utterly
destroyed
this
hand
i
love
as
i
have
loved
a
friend
this
body
i
tended
wept
with
and
enjoyed
since
there
is
no
escape
even
for
me
who
love
life
with
a
love
too
sharp
to
bear
the
scent
of
orchards
in
the
rain
the
sea
and
hours
alone
too
still
and
sure
for
prayer
since
darkness
waits
for
me
then
all
the
more
let
me
go
down
as
waves
sweep
to
the
shore
in
pride
and
let
me
sing
with
my
last
breath
in
these
few
hours
of
light
i
lift
my
head
life
is
my
lover
i
shall
leave
the
dead
if
there
is
any
way
to
baffle
death
the
dreams
of
my
heart
the
dreams
of
my
heart
and
my
mind
pass
nothing
stays
with
me
long
but
i
have
had
from
a
child
the
deep
solace
of
song
if
that
should
ever
leave
me
let
me
find
death
and
stay
with
things
whose
tunes
are
played
out
and
forgotten
like
the
rain
of
yesterday
a
little
while
a
little
while
when
i
am
gone
my
life
will
live
in
music
after
me
as
spun
foam
lifted
and
borne
on
after
the
wave
is
lost
in
the
full
sea
a
while
these
nights
and
days
will
burn
in
song
with
the
bright
frailty
of
foam
living
in
light
before
they
turn
back
to
the
nothingness
that
is
their
home
the
garden
my
heart
is
a
garden
tired
with
autumn
heaped
with
bending
asters
and
dahlias
heavy
and
dark
in
the
hazy
sunshine
the
garden
remembers
april
the
drench
of
rains
and
a
quick
and
clear
as
a
spark
daffodils
blowing
in
the
cold
wind
of
morning
and
golden
tulips
goblets
holding
the
rain
the
garden
will
be
hushed
with
snow
forgotten
soon
forgotten
after
the
stillness
will
spring
come
again
the
wine
i
can
not
die
who
drank
delight
from
the
cup
of
the
crescent
moon
and
hungrily
as
men
eat
bread
loved
the
scented
nights
of
june
the
rest
may
die
but
is
there
not
some
shining
strange
escape
for
me
who
sought
in
beauty
the
bright
wine
of
immortality
in
a
cuban
garden
hibiscus
flowers
are
cups
of
fire
love
me
my
lover
life
will
not
stay
the
bright
poinsettia
shakes
in
the
wind
a
scarlet
leaf
is
blowing
away
a
lizard
lifts
his
head
and
listens
kiss
me
before
the
noon
goes
by
here
in
the
shade
of
the
ceiba
hide
me
from
the
great
black
vulture
circling
the
sky
if
i
must
go
if
i
must
go
to
heaven
end
climbing
the
ages
like
a
stair
be
near
me
and
forever
bend
with
the
same
eyes
above
me
there
time
will
fly
past
us
like
leaves
flying
we
shall
not
heed
for
we
shall
be
beyond
living
beyond
dying
knowing
and
known
unchangeably
vii
in
spring
santa
barbara
i
have
been
happy
two
weeks
together
my
love
is
coming
home
to
me
gold
and
silver
is
the
weather
and
smooth
as
lapis
is
the
sea
the
earth
has
turned
its
brown
to
green
after
three
nights
of
humming
rain
and
in
the
valleys
peck
and
preen
linnets
with
a
scarlet
stain
high
in
the
mountains
all
alone
the
wild
swans
whistle
on
the
lakes
but
i
have
been
as
still
as
stone
my
heart
sings
only
when
it
breaks
white
fog
hills
are
drowned
in
wide
moving
waves
of
mist
phlox
before
my
door
are
wound
in
dripping
wreaths
of
amethyst
ten
feet
away
the
solid
earth
changes
into
melting
cloud
there
is
a
hush
of
pain
and
mirth
no
bird
has
heart
to
speak
aloud
here
in
a
world
without
a
sky
without
the
ground
without
the
sea
the
one
unchanging
thing
is
i
myself
remains
to
comfort
me
arcturus
arcturus
brings
the
spring
back
as
surely
now
as
when
he
rose
on
eastern
islands
for
grecian
girls
and
men
the
twilight
is
as
clear
a
blue
the
star
as
shaken
and
as
bright
and
the
same
thought
he
gave
to
them
he
gives
to
me
moonlight
it
will
not
hurt
me
when
i
am
old
a
running
tide
where
moonlight
burned
will
not
sting
me
like
silver
snakes
the
years
will
make
me
sad
and
cold
it
is
the
happy
heart
that
breaks
the
heart
asks
more
than
life
can
give
when
that
is
learned
then
all
is
learned
the
waves
break
fold
on
jewelled
fold
but
beauty
itself
is
fugitive
it
will
not
hurt
me
when
i
am
old
morning
song
a
diamond
of
a
morning
waked
me
an
hour
too
soon
dawn
had
taken
in
the
stars
and
left
the
faint
white
moon
o
white
moon
you
are
lonely
it
is
the
same
with
me
but
we
have
the
world
to
roam
over
only
the
lonely
are
free
gray
fog
a
fog
drifts
in
the
heavy
laden
cold
white
ghost
of
the
sea
one
by
one
the
hills
go
out
the
road
and
the
i
watch
the
fog
float
in
at
the
window
with
the
whole
world
gone
blind
everything
even
my
longing
drowses
even
the
thoughts
in
my
mind
i
put
my
head
on
my
hands
before
me
there
is
nothing
left
to
be
done
or
said
there
is
nothing
to
hope
for
i
am
tired
and
heavy
as
the
dead
bells
at
six
of
an
autumn
dusk
with
the
sky
in
the
west
a
rusty
red
the
bells
of
the
mission
down
in
the
valley
cry
out
that
the
day
is
dead
the
first
star
pricks
as
sharp
as
steel
why
am
i
suddenly
so
cold
three
bells
each
with
a
separate
sound
clang
in
the
valley
wearily
tolled
bells
in
venice
bells
at
sea
bells
in
the
valley
heavy
and
slow
there
is
no
place
over
the
crowded
world
where
i
can
forget
that
the
days
go
lovely
chance
o
lovely
chance
what
can
i
do
to
give
my
gratefulness
to
you
you
rise
between
myself
and
me
with
a
wise
persistency
i
would
have
broken
body
and
soul
but
by
your
grace
still
i
am
whole
many
a
thing
you
did
to
save
me
many
a
holy
gift
you
gave
me
music
and
friends
and
happy
love
more
than
my
dearest
dreaming
of
and
now
in
this
wide
twilight
hour
with
earth
and
heaven
a
dark
blue
flower
in
a
humble
mood
i
bless
your
wisdom
and
your
waywardness
you
brought
me
even
here
where
i
live
on
a
hill
against
the
sky
and
look
on
mountains
and
the
sea
and
a
thin
white
moon
in
the
pepper
tree
viii
there
will
come
soft
rains
war
time
there
will
come
soft
rains
and
the
smell
of
the
ground
and
swallows
circling
with
their
shimmering
sound
and
frogs
in
the
pools
singing
at
night
and
wild
in
tremulous
white
robins
will
wear
their
feathery
fire
whistling
their
whims
on
a
low
and
not
one
will
know
of
the
war
not
one
will
care
at
last
when
it
is
done
not
one
would
mind
neither
bird
nor
tree
if
mankind
perished
utterly
and
spring
herself
when
she
woke
at
dawn
would
scarcely
know
that
we
were
gone
in
a
garden
the
world
is
resting
without
sound
or
motion
behind
the
apple
tree
the
sun
goes
down
painting
with
fire
the
spires
and
the
windows
in
the
town
beyond
the
calm
connecticut
the
hills
lie
silvered
with
haze
as
fruits
still
fresh
with
bloom
the
swallows
weave
in
flight
across
the
zenith
on
an
aerial
loom
into
the
garden
peace
comes
back
with
twilight
peace
that
since
noon
had
left
the
purple
phlox
the
asters
the
late
roses
and
swaying
hollyhocks
for
at
i
heard
from
this
same
garden
the
murmur
as
when
many
come
up
from
the
village
surged
the
blind
and
beating
red
music
of
a
drum
and
the
hysterical
sharp
fife
that
shattered
the
brittle
autumn
air
while
they
came
the
young
men
marching
past
the
village
square
across
the
calm
connecticut
the
hills
change
to
violet
the
veils
of
dusk
are
deep
earth
takes
her
children
many
sorrows
calmly
and
stills
herself
to
sleep
nahant
bowed
as
an
elm
under
the
weight
of
its
beauty
so
earth
is
bowed
under
her
weight
of
splendor
molten
sea
richness
of
leaves
and
the
burnished
bronze
of
clefts
in
the
cliff
shelter
the
purple
and
chicory
flowers
bluer
than
the
ocean
flinging
its
foam
high
white
fire
in
sunshine
jewels
of
water
joyous
thunder
of
blown
waves
on
the
ledges
make
me
forget
war
and
the
dark
against
the
sky
a
sentry
paces
the
slim
in
his
khaki
winter
stars
i
went
out
at
night
alone
the
young
blood
flowing
beyond
the
sea
seemed
to
have
drenched
my
spirit
wings
i
bore
my
sorrow
heavily
but
when
i
lifted
up
my
head
from
shadows
shaken
on
the
snow
i
saw
orion
in
the
east
burn
steadily
as
long
ago
from
windows
in
my
father
house
dreaming
my
dreams
on
winter
nights
i
watched
orion
as
a
girl
above
another
city
lights
years
go
dreams
go
and
youth
goes
too
the
world
heart
breaks
beneath
its
wars
all
things
are
changed
save
in
the
east
the
faithful
beauty
of
the
stars
a
boy
out
of
the
noise
of
tired
people
working
harried
with
thoughts
of
war
and
lists
of
dead
his
beauty
met
me
like
a
fresh
wind
blowing
clean
boyish
beauty
and
head
eyes
that
told
secrets
lips
that
would
not
tell
them
fearless
and
shy
the
young
unwearied
eyes
men
die
by
millions
now
because
god
blunders
yet
to
have
made
this
boy
he
must
be
wise
winter
dusk
i
watch
the
great
clear
twilight
veiling
the
trees
their
branches
tinkle
faintly
with
crystal
melodies
the
larches
bend
their
silver
over
the
hush
of
snow
one
star
is
lighted
in
the
west
two
in
the
zenith
glow
for
a
moment
i
have
forgotten
wars
and
women
who
mourn
i
think
of
the
mother
who
bore
me
and
thank
her
that
i
was
born
by
the
sea
ix
the
unchanging
beaches
with
a
light
wind
blowing
from
the
immense
blue
circle
of
the
sea
and
the
soft
thunder
where
long
waves
whiten
these
were
the
same
for
sappho
as
for
me
two
thousand
years
much
has
gone
by
forever
change
takes
the
gods
and
ships
and
speech
of
men
but
here
on
the
beaches
that
time
passes
over
the
heart
aches
now
as
then
june
night
oh
earth
you
are
too
dear
how
can
i
sleep
while
all
around
floats
rainy
fragrance
and
the
far
deep
voice
of
the
ocean
that
talks
to
the
ground
oh
earth
you
gave
me
all
i
have
i
love
you
i
love
you
oh
what
have
i
that
i
can
give
you
in
return
except
my
body
after
i
die
like
barley
bending
like
barley
bending
in
low
fields
by
the
sea
singing
in
hard
wind
ceaselessly
like
barley
bending
and
rising
again
so
would
i
unbroken
rise
from
pain
so
would
i
softly
day
long
night
long
change
my
sorrow
into
song
oh
day
of
fire
and
sun
oh
day
of
fire
and
sun
pure
as
a
naked
flame
blue
sea
blue
sky
and
dun
sands
where
he
spoke
my
name
laughter
and
hearts
so
high
that
the
spirit
flew
off
free
lifting
into
the
sky
diving
into
the
sea
oh
day
of
fire
and
sun
like
a
crystal
burning
slow
days
go
one
by
one
but
you
have
no
returning
i
thought
of
you
i
thought
of
you
and
how
you
love
this
beauty
and
walking
up
the
long
beach
all
alone
i
heard
the
waves
breaking
in
measured
thunder
as
you
and
i
once
heard
their
monotone
around
me
were
the
echoing
dunes
beyond
me
the
cold
and
sparkling
silver
of
the
sea
we
two
will
pass
through
death
and
ages
lengthen
before
you
hear
that
sound
again
with
me
on
the
dunes
if
there
is
any
life
when
death
is
over
these
tawny
beaches
will
know
much
of
me
i
shall
come
back
as
constant
and
as
changeful
as
the
unchanging
sea
if
life
was
small
if
it
has
made
me
scornful
forgive
me
i
shall
straighten
like
a
flame
in
the
great
calm
of
death
and
if
you
want
me
stand
on
the
dunes
and
call
my
name
spray
i
knew
you
thought
of
me
all
night
i
knew
though
you
were
far
away
i
felt
your
love
blow
over
me
as
if
a
dark
sea
drenched
me
with
quivering
spray
there
are
so
many
ways
to
love
and
each
way
has
its
own
delight
then
be
content
to
come
to
me
only
as
spray
the
beating
sea
drives
inland
through
the
night
if
death
is
kind
perhaps
if
death
is
kind
and
there
can
be
returning
we
will
come
back
to
earth
some
fragrant
night
and
take
these
lanes
to
find
the
sea
and
bending
breathe
the
same
honeysuckle
low
and
white
we
will
come
down
at
night
to
these
resounding
beaches
and
the
long
gentle
thunder
of
the
sea
here
for
a
single
hour
in
the
wide
starlight
we
shall
be
happy
for
the
dead
are
free
x
thoughts
when
i
am
all
alone
envy
me
most
then
my
thoughts
flutter
round
me
in
a
glimmering
host
some
dressed
in
silver
some
dressed
in
white
each
like
a
taper
blossoming
light
most
of
them
merry
some
of
them
grave
each
of
them
lithe
as
willows
that
wave
some
bearing
violets
some
bearing
bay
one
with
a
burning
rose
hidden
away
when
i
am
all
alone
envy
me
then
for
i
have
better
friends
than
women
and
men
faces
people
that
i
meet
and
pass
in
the
city
broken
roar
faces
that
i
lose
so
soon
and
have
never
found
before
do
you
know
how
much
you
tell
in
the
meeting
of
our
eyes
how
ashamed
i
am
and
sad
to
have
pierced
your
poor
disguise
secrets
rushing
without
sound
crying
from
your
hiding
places
let
me
go
i
can
not
bear
the
sorrow
of
the
passing
faces
people
in
the
restless
street
can
it
be
oh
can
it
be
in
the
meeting
of
our
eyes
that
you
know
as
much
of
me
evening
new
york
blue
dust
of
evening
over
my
city
over
the
ocean
of
roofs
and
the
tall
towers
where
the
myriads
and
myriads
bloom
from
the
walls
like
climbing
flowers
snowfall
she
ca
be
unhappy
you
said
the
smiles
are
like
stars
in
her
eyes
and
her
laugh
is
thistledown
around
her
low
replies
is
she
unhappy
you
said
but
who
has
ever
known
another
heartbreak
all
he
can
know
is
his
own
and
she
seems
hushed
to
me
as
hushed
as
though
her
heart
were
a
hunter
fire
smothered
in
snow
the
silent
battle
in
memory
of
he
was
a
soldier
in
that
fight
where
there
is
neither
flag
nor
drum
and
without
sound
of
musketry
the
stealthy
foemen
come
year
in
year
out
by
day
and
night
they
forced
him
to
a
slow
retreat
and
for
his
gallant
fight
alone
no
fife
was
blown
and
no
drum
beat
in
winter
fog
in
gathering
mist
the
gray
grim
battle
had
its
end
and
at
the
very
last
we
knew
his
enemy
had
turned
his
friend
the
sanctuary
if
i
could
keep
my
innermost
me
fearless
aloof
and
free
of
the
least
breath
of
love
or
hate
and
not
disconsolate
at
the
sick
load
of
sorrow
laid
on
men
if
i
could
keep
a
sanctuary
there
free
even
of
prayer
if
i
could
do
this
then
with
quiet
candor
as
i
grew
more
wise
i
could
look
even
at
god
with
grave
forgiving
eyes
at
sea
in
the
pull
of
the
wind
i
stand
lonely
on
the
deck
of
a
ship
rising
falling
wild
night
around
me
wild
water
under
me
whipped
by
the
storm
screaming
and
calling
earth
is
hostile
and
the
sea
hostile
why
do
i
look
for
a
place
to
rest
i
must
fight
always
and
die
fighting
with
fear
an
unhealing
wound
in
my
breast
dust
when
i
went
to
look
at
what
had
long
been
hidden
a
jewel
laid
long
ago
in
a
secret
place
i
trembled
for
i
thought
to
see
its
dark
deep
fire
but
only
a
pinch
of
dust
blew
up
in
my
face
i
almost
gave
my
life
long
ago
for
a
thing
that
has
gone
to
dust
now
stinging
my
eyes
it
is
strange
how
often
a
heart
must
be
broken
before
the
years
can
make
it
wise
the
long
hill
i
must
have
passed
the
crest
a
while
ago
and
now
i
am
going
down
strange
to
have
crossed
the
crest
and
not
to
know
but
the
brambles
were
always
catching
the
hem
of
my
gown
all
the
morning
i
thought
how
proud
i
should
be
to
stand
there
straight
as
a
queen
wrapped
in
the
wind
and
the
sun
with
the
world
under
me
but
the
air
was
dull
there
was
little
i
could
have
seen
it
was
nearly
level
along
the
beaten
track
and
the
brambles
caught
in
my
gown
but
it
no
use
now
to
think
of
turning
back
the
rest
of
the
way
will
be
only
going
down
xi
summer
storm
the
panther
wind
leaps
out
of
the
night
the
snake
of
lightning
is
twisting
and
white
the
lion
of
thunder
roars
and
we
sit
still
and
content
under
a
tree
we
have
met
fate
together
and
love
and
pain
why
should
we
fear
the
wrath
of
the
rain
in
the
end
all
that
could
never
be
said
all
that
could
never
be
done
wait
for
us
at
last
somewhere
back
of
the
sun
all
the
heart
broke
to
forego
shall
be
ours
without
pain
we
shall
take
them
as
lightly
as
girls
pluck
flowers
after
rain
and
when
they
are
ours
in
the
end
perhaps
after
all
the
skies
will
not
open
for
us
nor
heaven
be
there
at
our
call
it
will
not
change
it
will
not
change
now
after
so
many
years
life
has
not
broken
it
with
parting
or
tears
death
will
not
alter
it
it
will
live
on
in
all
my
songs
for
you
when
i
am
gone
change
remember
me
as
i
was
then
turn
from
me
now
but
always
see
the
laughing
shadowy
girl
who
stood
at
midnight
by
the
flowering
tree
with
eyes
that
love
had
made
as
bright
as
the
trembling
stars
of
the
summer
night
turn
from
me
now
but
always
hear
the
muted
laughter
in
the
dew
of
that
one
year
of
youth
we
had
the
only
youth
we
ever
knew
turn
from
me
now
or
you
will
see
what
other
years
have
done
to
me
water
lilies
if
you
have
forgotten
water
lilies
floating
on
a
dark
lake
among
mountains
in
the
afternoon
shade
if
you
have
forgotten
their
wet
sleepy
fragrance
then
you
can
return
and
not
be
afraid
but
if
you
remember
then
turn
away
forever
to
the
plains
and
the
prairies
where
pools
are
far
apart
there
you
will
not
come
at
dusk
on
closing
water
lilies
and
the
shadow
of
mountains
will
not
fall
on
your
heart
did
you
never
know
did
you
never
know
long
ago
how
much
you
loved
me
that
your
love
would
never
lessen
and
never
go
you
were
young
then
proud
and
you
were
too
young
to
know
fate
is
a
wind
and
red
leaves
fly
before
it
far
apart
far
away
in
the
gusty
time
of
year
seldom
we
meet
now
but
when
i
hear
you
speaking
i
know
your
secret
my
dear
my
dear
the
treasure
when
they
see
my
songs
they
will
sigh
and
say
poor
soul
wistful
soul
lonely
night
and
day
they
will
never
know
all
your
love
for
me
surer
than
the
spring
stronger
than
the
sea
hidden
out
of
sight
like
a
miser
gold
in
forsaken
fields
where
the
wind
is
cold
the
storm
i
thought
of
you
when
i
was
wakened
by
a
wind
that
made
me
glad
and
afraid
of
the
rushing
pouring
sound
of
the
sea
that
the
great
trees
made
one
thought
in
my
mind
went
over
and
over
while
the
darkness
shook
and
the
leaves
were
thinned
i
thought
it
was
you
who
had
come
to
find
me
you
were
the
wind
songs
for
myself
xii
the
tree
oh
to
be
free
of
myself
with
nothing
left
to
remember
to
have
my
heart
as
bare
as
a
tree
in
december
resting
as
a
tree
rests
after
its
leaves
are
gone
waiting
no
more
for
a
rain
at
night
nor
for
the
red
at
dawn
but
still
oh
so
still
while
the
winds
come
and
go
with
no
more
fear
of
the
hard
frost
or
the
bright
burden
of
snow
and
heedless
heedless
if
anyone
pass
and
see
on
the
white
page
of
the
sky
its
thin
black
tracery
at
midnight
now
at
last
i
have
come
to
see
what
life
is
nothing
is
ever
ended
everything
only
begun
and
the
brave
victories
that
seem
so
splendid
are
never
really
won
even
love
that
i
built
my
spirit
house
for
comes
like
a
brooding
and
a
baffled
guest
and
music
and
men
praise
and
even
laughter
are
not
so
good
as
rest
song
making
my
heart
cried
like
a
beaten
child
ceaselessly
all
night
long
i
had
to
take
my
own
cries
and
thread
them
into
a
song
one
was
a
cry
at
black
midnight
and
one
when
the
first
cock
crew
my
heart
was
like
a
beaten
child
but
no
one
ever
knew
life
you
have
put
me
in
your
debt
and
i
must
serve
you
long
but
oh
the
debt
is
terrible
that
must
be
paid
in
song
alone
i
am
alone
in
spite
of
love
in
spite
of
all
i
take
and
give
in
spite
of
all
your
tenderness
sometimes
i
am
not
glad
to
live
i
am
alone
as
though
i
stood
on
the
highest
peak
of
the
tired
gray
world
about
me
only
swirling
snow
above
me
endless
space
unfurled
with
earth
hidden
and
heaven
hidden
and
only
my
own
spirit
pride
to
keep
me
from
the
peace
of
those
who
are
not
lonely
having
died
red
maples
in
the
last
year
i
have
learned
how
few
men
are
worth
my
trust
i
have
seen
the
friend
i
loved
struck
by
death
into
the
dust
and
fears
i
never
knew
before
have
knocked
and
knocked
upon
my
door
i
shall
hope
little
and
ask
for
less
i
said
there
is
no
happiness
i
have
grown
wise
at
last
but
how
can
i
hide
the
gleam
on
the
or
keep
the
fragrance
out
of
the
rain
now
that
april
is
here
again
when
maples
stand
in
a
haze
of
fire
what
can
i
say
to
the
old
desire
what
shall
i
do
with
the
joy
in
me
that
is
born
out
of
agony
debtor
so
long
as
my
spirit
still
is
glad
of
breath
and
lifts
its
plumes
of
pride
in
the
dark
face
of
death
while
i
am
curious
still
of
love
and
fame
keeping
my
heart
too
high
for
the
years
to
tame
how
can
i
quarrel
with
fate
since
i
can
see
i
am
a
debtor
to
life
not
life
to
me
the
wind
in
the
hemlock
steely
stars
and
moon
of
brass
how
mockingly
you
watch
me
pass
you
know
as
well
as
i
how
soon
i
shall
be
blind
to
stars
and
moon
deaf
to
the
wind
in
the
hemlock
tree
dumb
when
the
brown
earth
weighs
on
me
with
envious
dark
rage
i
bear
stars
your
cold
complacent
stare
in
my
hate
look
up
moon
at
your
clear
immortal
cup
changing
to
gold
from
dusky
red
age
after
age
when
i
am
dead
to
be
filled
up
with
light
and
then
emptied
to
be
refilled
again
what
has
man
done
that
only
he
is
slave
to
death
so
brutally
beaten
back
into
the
earth
impatient
for
him
since
his
birth
oh
let
me
shut
my
eyes
close
out
the
sight
of
stars
and
earth
and
be
sheltered
a
minute
by
this
tree
hemlock
through
your
fragrant
boughs
there
moves
no
anger
and
no
doubt
no
envy
of
immortal
things
the
murmurs
of
the
sea
with
veiled
music
ceaselessly
that
to
my
shaken
spirit
sings
from
their
frail
nest
the
robins
rouse
in
your
pungent
darkness
stirred
twittering
a
low
drowsy
word
and
me
you
shelter
even
me
in
your
quietness
you
house
the
wind
the
woman
and
the
bird
you
speak
to
me
and
i
have
heard
if
i
am
peaceful
i
shall
see
beauty
face
continually
feeding
on
her
wine
and
bread
i
shall
be
wholly
comforted
for
she
can
make
one
day
for
me
rich
as
my
lost
eternity
