transcribed
from
the
dent
edition
by
david
price
email
the
romany
rye
chapter
i
the
making
of
the
the
sound
sleeper
breakfast
the
postillion
departure
i
awoke
at
the
first
break
of
day
and
leaving
the
postillion
fast
asleep
stepped
out
of
the
tent
the
dingle
was
dank
and
dripping
i
lighted
a
fire
of
coals
and
got
my
forge
in
readiness
i
then
ascended
to
the
field
where
the
chaise
was
standing
as
we
had
left
it
on
the
previous
evening
after
looking
at
the
near
it
now
cold
and
split
into
three
pieces
i
set
about
prying
narrowly
into
the
condition
of
the
wheel
and
axletree
the
latter
had
sustained
no
damage
of
any
consequence
and
the
wheel
as
far
as
i
was
able
to
judge
was
sound
being
only
slightly
injured
in
the
box
the
only
thing
requisite
to
set
the
chaise
in
a
travelling
condition
appeared
to
be
a
which
i
determined
to
make
going
to
the
companion
wheel
i
took
out
the
which
i
carried
down
with
me
to
the
dingle
to
serve
as
a
model
i
found
belle
by
this
time
dressed
and
seated
near
the
forge
with
a
slight
nod
to
her
like
that
which
a
person
gives
who
happens
to
see
an
acquaintance
when
his
mind
is
occupied
with
important
business
i
forthwith
set
about
my
work
selecting
a
piece
of
iron
which
i
thought
would
serve
my
purpose
i
placed
it
in
the
fire
and
plying
the
bellows
in
a
furious
manner
soon
made
it
hot
then
seizing
it
with
the
tongs
i
laid
it
on
my
anvil
and
began
to
beat
it
with
my
hammer
according
to
the
rules
of
my
art
the
dingle
resounded
with
my
strokes
belle
sat
still
and
occasionally
smiled
but
suddenly
started
up
and
retreated
towards
her
encampment
on
a
spark
which
i
purposely
sent
in
her
direction
alighting
on
her
knee
i
found
the
making
of
a
no
easy
matter
it
was
however
less
difficult
than
the
fabrication
of
a
my
work
indeed
was
much
facilitated
by
my
having
another
pin
to
look
at
in
about
of
an
hour
i
had
succeeded
tolerably
well
and
had
produced
a
which
i
thought
would
serve
during
all
this
time
notwithstanding
the
noise
which
i
was
making
the
postillion
never
showed
his
face
his
at
first
alarmed
me
i
was
afraid
he
might
be
dead
but
on
looking
into
the
tent
i
found
him
still
buried
in
the
soundest
sleep
he
must
surely
be
descended
from
one
of
the
seven
sleepers
said
i
as
i
turned
away
and
resumed
my
work
my
work
finished
i
took
a
little
oil
leather
and
sand
and
polished
the
pin
as
well
as
i
could
then
summoning
belle
we
both
went
to
the
chaise
where
with
her
assistance
i
put
on
the
wheel
the
pin
which
i
had
made
fitted
its
place
very
well
and
having
replaced
the
other
i
gazed
at
the
chaise
for
some
time
with
my
heart
full
of
that
satisfaction
which
results
from
the
consciousness
of
having
achieved
a
great
action
then
after
looking
at
belle
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
a
compliment
from
her
lips
which
did
not
come
i
returned
to
the
dingle
without
saying
a
word
followed
by
her
belle
set
about
making
preparations
for
breakfast
and
i
taking
the
kettle
went
and
filled
it
at
the
spring
having
hung
it
over
the
fire
i
went
to
the
tent
in
which
the
postillion
was
still
sleeping
and
called
upon
him
to
arise
he
awoke
with
a
start
and
stared
around
him
at
first
with
the
utmost
surprise
not
unmixed
i
could
observe
with
a
certain
degree
of
fear
at
last
looking
in
my
face
he
appeared
to
recollect
himself
i
had
quite
forgot
said
he
as
he
got
up
where
i
was
and
all
that
happened
yesterday
however
i
remember
now
the
whole
affair
frightened
horses
and
all
your
kindness
come
i
must
see
after
my
coach
and
horses
i
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
repair
the
damage
the
damage
is
already
quite
repaired
said
i
as
you
will
see
if
you
come
to
the
field
above
you
do
say
so
said
the
postillion
coming
out
of
the
tent
well
i
am
mightily
beholden
to
you
good
morning
young
said
he
addressing
belle
who
having
finished
her
preparations
was
seated
near
the
fire
good
morning
young
man
said
belle
i
suppose
you
would
be
glad
of
some
breakfast
however
you
must
wait
a
little
the
kettle
does
not
boil
come
and
look
at
your
chaise
said
i
but
tell
me
how
it
happened
that
the
noise
which
i
have
been
making
did
not
awake
you
for
of
an
hour
at
least
i
was
hammering
close
at
your
ear
i
heard
you
all
the
time
said
the
postillion
but
your
hammering
made
me
sleep
all
the
sounder
i
am
used
to
hear
hammering
in
my
morning
sleep
there
a
forge
close
by
the
room
where
i
sleep
when
i
at
home
at
my
inn
for
we
have
all
kinds
of
conveniences
at
my
inn
forge
carpenter
shop
and
so
that
when
i
heard
you
hammering
i
thought
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
old
noise
and
that
i
was
comfortable
in
my
bed
at
my
own
inn
we
now
ascended
to
the
field
where
i
showed
the
postillion
his
chaise
he
looked
at
the
pin
attentively
rubbed
his
hands
and
gave
a
loud
laugh
is
it
not
well
done
said
i
it
will
do
till
i
get
home
he
replied
and
that
is
all
you
have
to
say
i
demanded
and
that
a
good
deal
said
he
considering
who
made
it
but
do
be
offended
he
added
i
shall
prize
it
all
the
more
for
its
being
made
by
a
gentleman
and
no
blacksmith
and
so
will
my
governor
when
i
show
it
to
him
i
sha
let
it
remain
where
it
is
but
will
keep
it
as
a
remembrance
of
you
as
long
as
i
live
he
then
again
rubbed
his
hands
with
great
glee
and
said
i
will
now
go
and
see
after
my
horses
and
then
to
breakfast
partner
if
you
please
suddenly
however
looking
at
his
hands
he
said
before
sitting
down
to
breakfast
i
am
in
the
habit
of
washing
my
hands
and
face
i
suppose
you
could
not
furnish
me
with
a
little
soap
and
water
as
much
water
as
you
please
said
i
but
if
you
want
soap
i
must
go
and
trouble
the
young
for
some
by
no
means
said
the
postillion
water
will
do
at
a
pinch
follow
me
said
i
and
leading
him
to
the
pond
of
the
frogs
and
newts
i
said
this
is
my
ewer
you
are
welcome
to
part
of
it
the
water
is
so
soft
that
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
add
soap
to
it
then
lying
down
on
the
bank
i
plunged
my
head
into
the
water
then
scrubbed
my
hands
and
face
and
afterwards
wiped
them
with
some
long
grass
which
grew
on
the
margin
of
the
pond
bravo
said
the
postillion
i
see
you
know
how
to
make
a
shift
he
then
followed
my
example
declared
he
never
felt
more
refreshed
in
his
life
and
giving
a
bound
said
he
would
go
and
look
after
his
horses
we
then
went
to
look
after
the
horses
which
we
found
not
much
the
worse
for
having
spent
the
night
in
the
open
air
my
companion
again
inserted
their
heads
in
the
and
leaving
the
animals
to
discuss
their
corn
returned
with
me
to
the
dingle
where
we
found
the
kettle
boiling
we
sat
down
and
belle
made
tea
and
did
the
honours
of
the
meal
the
postillion
was
in
high
spirits
ate
heartily
and
to
belle
evident
satisfaction
declared
that
he
had
never
drank
better
tea
in
his
life
or
indeed
any
half
so
good
breakfast
over
he
said
that
he
must
now
go
and
harness
his
horses
as
it
was
high
time
for
him
to
return
to
his
inn
belle
gave
him
her
hand
and
wished
him
farewell
the
postillion
shook
her
hand
warmly
and
was
advancing
close
up
to
her
for
what
purpose
i
can
not
say
whereupon
belle
withdrawing
her
hand
drew
herself
up
with
an
air
which
caused
the
postillion
to
retreat
a
step
or
two
with
an
exceedingly
sheepish
look
recovering
himself
however
he
made
a
low
bow
and
proceeded
up
the
path
i
attended
him
and
helped
to
harness
his
horses
and
put
them
to
the
vehicle
he
then
shook
me
by
the
hand
and
taking
the
reins
and
whip
mounted
to
his
seat
ere
he
drove
away
he
thus
addressed
me
if
ever
i
forget
your
kindness
and
that
of
the
young
woman
below
dash
my
buttons
if
ever
either
of
you
should
enter
my
inn
you
may
depend
upon
a
warm
welcome
the
best
that
can
be
set
before
you
and
no
expense
to
either
for
i
will
give
both
of
you
the
best
of
characters
to
the
governor
who
is
the
very
best
fellow
upon
all
the
road
as
for
your
i
trust
it
will
serve
till
i
get
home
when
i
will
take
it
out
and
keep
it
in
remembrance
of
you
all
the
days
of
my
life
then
giving
the
horses
a
jerk
with
his
reins
he
cracked
his
whip
and
drove
off
i
returned
to
the
dingle
belle
had
removed
the
breakfast
things
and
was
busy
in
her
own
encampment
nothing
occurred
worthy
of
being
related
for
two
hours
at
the
end
of
which
time
belle
departed
on
a
short
expedition
and
i
again
found
myself
alone
in
the
dingle
chapter
ii
the
man
in
black
the
emperor
of
germany
nepotism
donna
olympia
omnipotence
camillo
astalli
the
five
propositions
in
the
evening
i
received
another
visit
from
the
man
in
black
i
had
been
taking
a
stroll
in
the
neighbourhood
and
was
sitting
in
the
dingle
in
rather
a
listless
manner
scarcely
knowing
how
to
employ
myself
his
coming
therefore
was
by
no
means
disagreeable
to
me
i
produced
the
hollands
and
glass
from
my
tent
where
isopel
berners
had
requested
me
to
deposit
them
and
also
some
lump
sugar
then
taking
the
gotch
i
fetched
water
from
the
spring
and
sitting
down
begged
the
man
in
black
to
help
himself
he
was
not
slow
in
complying
with
my
desire
and
prepared
for
himself
a
glass
of
hollands
and
water
with
a
lump
of
sugar
in
it
after
he
had
taken
two
or
three
sips
with
evident
satisfaction
i
remembering
his
chuckling
exclamation
of
go
to
rome
for
money
when
he
last
left
the
dingle
took
the
liberty
after
a
little
conversation
of
reminding
him
of
it
whereupon
with
a
he
he
he
he
replied
your
idea
was
not
quite
so
original
as
i
supposed
after
leaving
you
the
other
night
i
remembered
having
read
of
an
emperor
of
germany
who
conceived
the
idea
of
applying
to
rome
for
money
and
actually
put
it
into
practice
urban
the
eighth
then
occupied
the
papal
chair
of
the
family
of
the
barbarini
nicknamed
the
mosche
or
flies
from
the
circumstance
of
bees
being
their
armorial
bearing
the
emperor
having
exhausted
all
his
money
in
endeavouring
to
defend
the
church
against
gustavus
adolphus
the
great
king
of
sweden
who
was
bent
on
its
destruction
applied
in
his
necessity
to
the
pope
for
a
loan
of
money
the
pope
however
and
his
relations
whose
cellars
were
at
that
time
full
of
the
money
of
the
church
which
they
had
been
plundering
for
years
refused
to
lend
him
a
scudo
whereupon
a
pasquinade
picture
was
stuck
up
at
rome
representing
the
church
lying
on
a
bed
gashed
with
dreadful
wounds
and
beset
all
over
with
flies
which
were
sucking
her
whilst
the
emperor
of
germany
was
kneeling
before
her
with
a
miserable
face
requesting
a
little
money
towards
carrying
on
the
war
against
the
heretics
to
which
the
poor
church
was
made
to
say
can
i
assist
you
o
my
champion
do
you
not
see
that
the
flies
have
sucked
me
to
the
very
bones
which
story
said
he
shows
that
the
idea
of
going
to
rome
for
money
was
not
quite
so
original
as
i
imagined
the
other
night
though
utterly
preposterous
this
affair
said
he
occurred
in
what
were
called
the
days
of
nepotism
certain
popes
who
wished
to
make
themselves
in
some
degree
independent
of
the
cardinals
surrounded
themselves
with
their
nephews
and
the
rest
of
their
family
who
sucked
the
church
and
christendom
as
much
as
they
could
none
doing
so
more
effectually
than
the
relations
of
urban
the
eighth
at
whose
death
according
to
the
book
called
the
di
roma
there
were
in
the
barbarini
family
two
hundred
and
governments
abbeys
and
high
dignities
and
so
much
hard
cash
in
their
possession
that
threescore
and
ten
mules
were
scarcely
sufficient
to
convey
the
plunder
of
one
of
them
to
palestrina
he
added
however
that
it
was
probable
that
christendom
fared
better
whilst
the
popes
were
thus
independent
as
it
was
less
sucked
whereas
before
and
after
that
period
it
was
sucked
by
hundreds
instead
of
tens
by
the
cardinals
and
all
their
relations
instead
of
by
the
pope
and
his
nephews
only
then
after
drinking
rather
copiously
of
his
hollands
he
said
that
it
was
certainly
no
bad
idea
of
the
popes
to
surround
themselves
with
nephews
on
whom
they
bestowed
great
church
dignities
as
by
so
doing
they
were
tolerably
safe
from
poison
whereas
a
pope
if
abandoned
to
the
cardinals
might
at
any
time
be
made
away
with
by
them
provided
they
thought
that
he
lived
too
long
or
that
he
seemed
disposed
to
do
anything
which
they
disliked
adding
that
ganganelli
would
never
have
been
poisoned
provided
he
had
had
nephews
about
him
to
take
care
of
his
life
and
to
see
that
nothing
unholy
was
put
into
his
food
or
a
bustling
stirring
brother
wife
like
donna
olympia
he
then
with
a
he
he
he
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
read
the
book
called
the
nipotismo
di
roma
and
on
my
replying
in
the
negative
he
told
me
that
it
was
a
very
curious
and
entertaining
book
which
he
occasionally
looked
at
in
an
idle
hour
and
proceeded
to
relate
to
me
anecdotes
out
of
the
nipotismo
di
roma
about
the
successor
of
urban
innocent
the
tenth
and
donna
olympia
showing
how
fond
he
was
of
her
and
how
she
cooked
his
food
and
kept
the
cardinals
away
from
it
and
how
she
and
her
creatures
plundered
christendom
with
the
sanction
of
the
pope
until
christendom
becoming
enraged
insisted
that
he
should
put
her
away
which
he
did
for
a
time
putting
a
nephew
one
camillo
astalli
in
her
place
in
which
however
he
did
not
continue
long
for
the
pope
conceiving
a
pique
against
him
banished
him
from
his
sight
and
recalled
donna
olympia
who
took
care
of
his
food
and
plundered
christendom
until
pope
innocent
died
i
said
that
i
only
wondered
that
between
pope
and
cardinals
the
whole
system
of
rome
had
not
long
fallen
to
the
ground
and
was
told
in
reply
that
its
not
having
fallen
was
the
strongest
proof
of
its
vital
power
and
the
absolute
necessity
for
the
existence
of
the
system
that
the
system
notwithstanding
its
occasional
disorders
went
on
popes
and
cardinals
might
prey
upon
its
bowels
and
sell
its
interests
but
the
system
survived
the
cutting
off
of
this
or
that
member
was
not
able
to
cause
rome
any
vital
loss
for
as
soon
as
she
lost
a
member
the
loss
was
supplied
by
her
own
inherent
vitality
though
her
popes
had
been
poisoned
by
cardinals
and
her
cardinals
by
popes
and
though
priests
occasionally
poisoned
popes
cardinals
and
each
other
after
all
that
had
been
and
might
be
she
had
still
and
would
ever
have
her
priests
cardinals
and
pope
finding
the
man
in
black
so
communicative
and
reasonable
i
determined
to
make
the
best
of
my
opportunity
and
learn
from
him
all
i
could
with
respect
to
the
papal
system
and
told
him
that
he
would
particularly
oblige
me
by
telling
me
who
the
pope
of
rome
was
and
received
for
answer
that
he
was
an
old
man
elected
by
a
majority
of
cardinals
to
the
papal
chair
who
immediately
after
his
election
became
omnipotent
and
equal
to
god
on
earth
on
my
begging
him
not
to
talk
such
nonsense
and
asking
him
how
a
person
could
be
omnipotent
who
could
not
always
preserve
himself
from
poison
even
when
fenced
round
by
nephews
or
protected
by
a
bustling
woman
he
after
taking
a
long
sip
of
hollands
and
water
told
me
that
i
must
not
expect
too
much
from
omnipotence
for
example
that
as
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
that
one
above
could
annihilate
the
past
for
instance
the
seven
years
war
or
the
french
revolution
though
any
one
who
believed
in
him
would
acknowledge
him
to
be
omnipotent
so
would
it
be
unreasonable
for
the
faithful
to
expect
that
the
pope
could
always
guard
himself
from
poison
then
after
looking
at
me
for
a
moment
stedfastly
and
taking
another
sip
he
told
me
that
popes
had
frequently
done
impossibilities
for
example
innocent
the
tenth
had
created
a
nephew
for
not
liking
particularly
any
of
his
real
nephews
he
had
created
the
said
camillo
astalli
his
nephew
asking
me
with
a
he
he
what
but
omnipotence
could
make
a
young
man
nephew
to
a
person
to
whom
he
was
not
in
the
slightest
degree
related
on
my
observing
that
of
course
no
one
believed
that
the
young
fellow
was
really
the
nephew
though
the
pope
might
have
adopted
him
as
such
the
man
in
black
replied
that
the
reality
of
the
nephewship
of
camillo
astalli
had
hitherto
never
become
a
point
of
faith
let
however
the
present
pope
or
any
other
pope
proclaim
that
it
is
necessary
to
believe
in
the
reality
of
the
nephewship
of
camillo
astalli
and
see
whether
the
faithful
would
not
believe
in
it
who
can
doubt
that
he
added
seeing
that
they
believe
in
the
reality
of
the
five
propositions
of
jansenius
the
jesuits
wishing
to
ruin
the
jansenists
induced
a
pope
to
declare
that
such
and
such
damnable
opinions
which
they
called
five
propositions
were
to
be
found
in
a
book
written
by
jansen
though
in
reality
no
such
propositions
were
to
be
found
there
whereupon
the
existence
of
these
propositions
became
forthwith
a
point
of
faith
to
the
faithful
do
you
then
think
he
demanded
that
there
is
one
of
the
faithful
who
would
not
swallow
if
called
upon
the
nephewship
of
camillo
astalli
as
easily
as
the
five
propositions
of
jansenius
surely
then
said
i
the
faithful
must
be
a
pretty
pack
of
simpletons
whereupon
the
man
in
black
exclaimed
what
a
protestant
and
an
infringer
of
the
rights
of
faith
here
a
fellow
who
would
feel
himself
insulted
if
any
one
were
to
ask
him
how
he
could
believe
in
the
miraculous
conception
calling
people
simpletons
who
swallow
the
five
propositions
of
jansenius
and
are
disposed
if
called
upon
to
swallow
the
reality
of
the
nephewship
of
camillo
astalli
i
was
about
to
speak
when
i
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
belle
after
unharnessing
her
donkey
and
adjusting
her
person
a
little
she
came
and
sat
down
by
us
in
the
meantime
i
had
helped
my
companion
to
some
more
hollands
and
water
and
had
plunged
with
him
into
yet
deeper
discourse
chapter
iii
necessity
of
religion
the
great
indian
one
shakespeare
the
pat
answer
krishna
amen
having
told
the
man
in
black
that
i
should
like
to
know
all
the
truth
with
regard
to
the
pope
and
his
system
he
assured
me
he
should
be
delighted
to
give
me
all
the
information
in
his
power
that
he
had
come
to
the
dingle
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
the
good
cheer
which
i
was
in
the
habit
of
giving
him
as
in
the
hope
of
inducing
me
to
enlist
under
the
banners
of
rome
and
to
fight
in
her
cause
and
that
he
had
no
doubt
that
by
speaking
out
frankly
to
me
he
ran
the
best
chance
of
winning
me
over
he
then
proceeded
to
tell
me
that
the
experience
of
countless
ages
had
proved
the
necessity
of
religion
the
necessity
he
would
admit
was
only
for
simpletons
but
as
of
the
dwellers
upon
this
earth
were
simpletons
it
would
never
do
for
sensible
people
to
run
counter
to
their
folly
but
on
the
contrary
it
was
their
wisest
course
to
encourage
them
in
it
always
provided
that
by
so
doing
sensible
people
would
derive
advantage
that
the
truly
sensible
people
of
this
world
were
the
priests
who
without
caring
a
straw
for
religion
for
its
own
sake
made
use
of
it
as
a
cord
by
which
to
draw
the
simpletons
after
them
that
there
were
many
religions
in
this
world
all
of
which
had
been
turned
to
excellent
account
by
the
priesthood
but
that
the
one
the
best
adapted
for
the
purposes
of
priestcraft
was
the
popish
which
he
said
was
the
oldest
in
the
world
and
the
best
calculated
to
endure
on
my
inquiring
what
he
meant
by
saying
the
popish
religion
was
the
oldest
in
the
world
whereas
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
greek
and
roman
religion
had
existed
long
before
it
to
say
nothing
of
the
old
indian
religion
still
in
existence
and
vigour
he
said
with
a
nod
after
taking
a
sip
at
his
glass
that
between
me
and
him
the
popish
religion
that
of
greece
and
rome
and
the
old
indian
system
were
in
reality
one
and
the
same
you
told
me
that
you
intended
to
be
frank
said
i
but
however
frank
you
may
be
i
think
you
are
rather
wild
we
priests
of
rome
said
the
man
in
black
even
those
amongst
us
who
do
not
go
much
abroad
know
a
great
deal
about
church
matters
of
which
you
heretics
have
very
little
idea
those
of
our
brethren
of
the
propaganda
on
their
return
home
from
distant
missions
not
unfrequently
tell
us
very
strange
things
relating
to
our
dear
mother
for
example
our
first
missionaries
to
the
east
were
not
slow
in
discovering
and
telling
to
their
brethren
that
our
religion
and
the
great
indian
one
were
identical
no
more
difference
between
them
than
between
ram
and
rome
priests
convents
beads
prayers
processions
fastings
penances
all
the
same
not
forgetting
anchorites
and
vermin
he
he
the
pope
they
found
under
the
title
of
the
grand
lama
a
sucking
child
surrounded
by
an
immense
number
of
priests
our
good
brethren
some
two
hundred
years
ago
had
a
hearty
laugh
which
their
successors
have
often
they
said
that
helpless
suckling
and
its
priests
put
them
so
much
in
mind
of
their
own
old
man
surrounded
by
his
cardinals
he
he
old
age
is
second
childhood
did
they
find
christ
said
i
they
found
him
too
said
the
man
in
black
that
is
they
saw
his
image
he
is
considered
in
india
as
a
pure
kind
of
being
and
on
that
account
perhaps
is
kept
there
rather
in
the
background
even
as
he
is
here
all
this
is
very
mysterious
to
me
said
i
very
likely
said
the
man
in
black
but
of
this
i
am
tolerably
sure
and
so
are
most
of
those
of
rome
that
modern
rome
had
its
religion
from
ancient
rome
which
had
its
religion
from
the
east
but
how
i
demanded
it
was
brought
about
i
believe
by
the
wanderings
of
nations
said
the
man
in
black
a
brother
of
the
propaganda
a
very
learned
man
once
told
me
i
do
not
mean
mezzofanti
who
has
not
five
ideas
this
brother
once
told
me
that
all
we
of
the
old
world
from
calcutta
to
dublin
are
of
the
same
stock
and
were
originally
of
the
same
language
and
all
of
one
religion
i
put
in
all
of
one
religion
said
the
man
in
black
and
now
follow
different
modifications
of
the
same
religion
we
christians
are
not
said
i
you
heretics
are
not
you
mean
said
the
man
in
black
but
you
will
be
put
down
just
as
you
have
always
been
though
others
may
rise
up
after
you
the
true
religion
is
people
may
strive
against
it
but
they
will
only
work
themselves
to
an
oil
how
did
it
fare
with
that
greek
emperor
the
iconoclast
what
was
his
name
leon
the
isaurian
did
not
his
cost
him
italy
the
fairest
province
of
his
empire
and
did
not
ten
fresh
images
start
up
at
home
for
every
one
which
he
demolished
oh
you
little
know
the
craving
which
the
soul
sometimes
feels
after
a
good
bodily
image
i
have
indeed
no
conception
of
it
said
i
i
have
an
abhorrence
of
idolatry
the
idea
of
bowing
before
a
graven
figure
the
idea
indeed
said
belle
who
had
now
joined
us
did
you
never
bow
before
that
of
shakespeare
said
the
man
in
black
addressing
himself
to
me
after
a
low
bow
to
belle
i
do
remember
that
i
ever
did
said
i
but
even
suppose
i
did
suppose
you
did
said
the
man
in
black
shame
on
you
hater
of
idolatry
why
the
very
supposition
brings
you
to
the
ground
you
must
make
figures
of
shakespeare
must
you
then
why
not
of
antonio
or
ignacio
or
of
a
greater
personage
still
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
he
cried
interrupting
me
as
i
was
about
to
speak
you
make
his
image
in
order
to
pay
it
divine
honours
but
only
to
look
at
it
and
think
of
shakespeare
but
this
looking
at
a
thing
in
order
to
think
of
a
person
is
the
very
basis
of
idolatry
shakespeare
works
are
not
sufficient
for
you
no
more
are
the
bible
or
the
legend
of
saint
anthony
or
saint
ignacio
for
us
that
is
for
those
of
us
who
believe
in
them
i
tell
you
zingara
that
no
religion
can
exist
long
which
rejects
a
good
bodily
image
do
you
think
said
i
that
shakespeare
works
would
not
exist
without
his
image
i
believe
said
the
man
in
black
that
shakespeare
image
is
looked
at
more
than
his
works
and
will
be
looked
at
and
perhaps
adored
when
they
are
forgotten
i
am
surprised
that
they
have
not
been
forgotten
long
ago
i
am
no
admirer
of
them
but
i
ca
imagine
said
i
how
you
will
put
aside
the
authority
of
moses
if
moses
strove
against
should
not
his
doing
so
be
conclusive
as
to
the
impropriety
of
the
practice
what
higher
authority
can
you
have
than
that
of
moses
the
practice
of
the
great
majority
of
the
human
race
said
the
man
in
black
and
the
recurrence
to
where
has
been
abolished
do
you
know
that
moses
is
considered
by
the
church
as
no
better
than
a
heretic
and
though
for
particular
reasons
it
has
been
obliged
to
adopt
his
writings
the
adoption
was
merely
a
sham
one
as
it
never
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
them
no
no
the
church
was
never
led
by
moses
nor
by
one
mightier
than
he
whose
doctrine
it
has
equally
nullified
i
allude
to
krishna
in
his
second
avatar
the
church
it
is
true
governs
in
his
name
but
not
unfrequently
gives
him
the
lie
if
he
happens
to
have
said
anything
which
it
dislikes
did
you
never
hear
the
reply
which
padre
paolo
segani
made
to
the
french
protestant
jean
anthoine
guerin
who
had
asked
him
whether
it
was
easier
for
christ
to
have
been
mistaken
in
his
gospel
than
for
the
pope
to
be
mistaken
in
his
decrees
i
never
heard
their
names
before
said
i
the
answer
was
pat
said
the
man
in
black
though
he
who
made
it
was
confessedly
the
most
ignorant
fellow
of
the
very
ignorant
order
to
which
he
belonged
the
augustine
might
err
as
a
man
said
he
the
pope
can
never
err
being
god
the
whole
story
is
related
in
the
nipotismo
i
wonder
you
should
ever
have
troubled
yourself
with
christ
at
all
said
i
what
was
to
be
done
said
the
man
in
black
the
power
of
that
name
suddenly
came
over
europe
like
the
power
of
a
mighty
wind
it
was
said
to
have
come
from
judea
and
from
judea
it
probably
came
when
it
first
began
to
agitate
minds
in
these
parts
but
it
seems
to
have
been
known
in
the
remote
east
more
or
less
for
thousands
of
years
previously
it
filled
people
minds
with
madness
it
was
followed
by
books
which
were
never
much
regarded
as
they
contained
little
of
insanity
but
the
name
what
fury
that
breathed
into
people
the
books
were
about
peace
and
gentleness
but
the
name
was
the
most
horrible
of
those
who
wished
to
uphold
old
names
at
first
strove
to
oppose
it
but
their
efforts
were
feeble
and
they
had
no
good
what
was
mars
as
a
cry
compared
with
the
name
of
it
was
said
that
they
persecuted
terribly
but
who
said
so
the
christians
the
christians
could
have
given
them
a
lesson
in
the
art
of
persecution
and
eventually
did
so
none
but
christians
have
ever
been
good
persecutors
well
the
old
religion
succumbed
christianity
prevailed
for
the
ferocious
is
sure
to
prevail
over
the
gentle
i
thought
said
i
you
stated
a
little
time
ago
that
the
popish
religion
and
the
ancient
roman
are
the
same
in
every
point
but
that
name
that
krishna
and
the
fury
and
love
of
persecution
which
it
inspired
said
the
man
in
black
a
hot
blast
came
from
the
east
sounding
krishna
it
absolutely
maddened
people
minds
and
the
people
would
call
themselves
his
children
we
will
not
belong
to
jupiter
any
longer
we
will
belong
to
krishna
and
they
did
belong
to
krishna
that
is
in
name
but
in
nothing
else
for
who
ever
cared
for
krishna
in
the
christian
world
or
who
ever
regarded
the
words
attributed
to
him
or
put
them
in
practice
why
we
protestants
regard
his
words
and
endeavour
to
practise
what
they
enjoin
as
much
as
possible
but
you
reject
his
image
said
the
man
in
black
better
reject
his
words
than
his
image
no
religion
can
exist
long
which
rejects
a
good
bodily
image
why
the
very
negro
barbarians
of
high
barbary
could
give
you
a
lesson
on
that
point
they
have
their
fetish
images
to
which
they
look
for
help
in
their
afflictions
they
have
likewise
a
high
priest
whom
they
call
mumbo
jumbo
said
i
i
know
all
about
him
already
how
came
you
to
know
anything
about
him
said
the
man
in
black
with
a
look
of
some
surprise
some
of
us
poor
protestants
tinkers
said
i
though
we
live
in
dingles
are
also
acquainted
with
a
thing
or
two
i
really
believe
you
are
said
the
man
in
black
staring
at
me
but
in
connection
with
this
mumbo
jumbo
i
could
relate
to
you
a
comical
story
about
a
fellow
an
english
servant
i
once
met
at
rome
it
would
be
quite
unnecessary
said
i
i
would
much
sooner
hear
you
talk
about
krishna
his
words
and
image
spoken
like
a
true
heretic
said
the
man
in
black
one
of
the
faithful
would
have
placed
his
image
before
his
words
for
what
are
all
the
words
in
the
world
compared
with
a
good
bodily
image
i
believe
you
occasionally
quote
his
words
said
i
he
he
said
the
man
in
black
occasionally
for
example
said
i
upon
this
rock
i
will
found
my
church
he
he
said
the
man
in
black
you
must
really
become
one
of
us
yet
you
must
have
had
some
difficulty
in
getting
the
rock
to
rome
none
whatever
said
the
man
in
black
faith
can
remove
mountains
to
say
nothing
of
rocks
ho
ho
but
i
can
not
imagine
said
i
what
advantage
you
could
derive
from
perverting
those
words
of
scripture
in
which
the
saviour
talks
about
eating
his
body
i
do
not
know
indeed
why
we
troubled
our
heads
about
the
matter
at
all
said
the
man
in
black
but
when
you
talk
about
perverting
the
meaning
of
the
text
you
speak
ignorantly
tinker
when
he
whom
you
call
the
saviour
gave
his
followers
the
sop
and
bade
them
eat
it
telling
them
it
was
his
body
he
delicately
alluded
to
what
it
was
incumbent
upon
them
to
do
after
his
death
namely
to
eat
his
body
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
intended
they
should
actually
eat
his
body
then
you
suppose
ignorantly
said
the
man
in
black
eating
the
bodies
of
the
dead
was
a
heathenish
custom
practised
by
the
heirs
and
legatees
of
people
who
left
property
and
this
custom
is
alluded
to
in
the
text
but
what
has
the
new
testament
to
do
with
heathen
customs
said
i
except
to
destroy
them
more
than
you
suppose
said
the
man
in
black
we
priests
of
rome
who
have
long
lived
at
rome
know
much
better
what
the
new
testament
is
made
of
than
the
heretics
and
their
theologians
not
forgetting
their
tinkers
though
i
confess
some
of
the
latter
have
occasionally
surprised
us
for
example
bunyan
the
new
testament
is
crowded
with
allusions
to
heathen
customs
and
with
words
connected
with
pagan
sorcery
now
with
respect
to
words
i
would
fain
have
you
who
pretend
to
be
a
philologist
tell
me
the
meaning
of
amen
i
made
no
answer
we
of
rome
said
the
man
in
black
know
two
or
three
things
of
which
the
heretics
are
quite
ignorant
for
example
there
are
those
amongst
us
those
too
who
do
not
pretend
to
be
philologists
who
know
what
amen
is
and
moreover
how
we
got
it
we
got
it
from
our
ancestors
the
priests
of
ancient
rome
and
they
got
the
word
from
their
ancestors
of
the
east
the
priests
of
buddh
and
brahma
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
i
demanded
amen
said
the
man
in
black
is
a
modification
of
the
old
hindoo
formula
omani
batsikhom
by
the
almost
ceaseless
repetition
of
which
the
indians
hope
to
be
received
finally
to
the
rest
or
state
of
forgetfulness
of
buddh
or
brahma
a
foolish
practice
you
will
say
but
are
you
heretics
much
wiser
who
are
continually
sticking
amen
to
the
end
of
your
prayers
little
knowing
when
you
do
so
that
you
are
consigning
yourselves
to
the
repose
of
buddh
oh
what
hearty
laughs
our
missionaries
have
had
when
comparing
the
eastern
gibberish
of
omani
batsikhom
omani
batsikhom
and
the
ave
maria
and
amen
jesus
of
our
own
idiotical
devotees
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
the
ave
marias
and
amens
of
your
superstitious
devotees
said
i
i
dare
say
that
they
use
them
nonsensically
enough
but
in
putting
amen
to
the
end
of
a
prayer
we
merely
intend
to
express
let
it
be
it
means
nothing
of
the
kind
said
the
man
in
black
and
the
hindoos
might
just
as
well
put
your
national
oath
at
the
end
of
their
prayers
as
perhaps
they
will
after
a
great
many
thousand
years
when
english
is
forgotten
and
only
a
few
words
of
it
remembered
by
dim
tradition
without
being
understood
how
strange
if
after
the
lapse
of
four
thousand
years
the
hindoos
should
damn
themselves
to
the
blindness
so
dear
to
their
present
masters
even
as
their
masters
at
present
consign
themselves
to
the
forgetfulness
so
dear
to
the
hindoos
but
my
glass
has
been
empty
for
a
considerable
time
perhaps
bellissima

said
he
addressing
belle
you
will
deign
to
replenish
it
i
shall
do
no
such
thing
said
belle
you
have
drunk
quite
enough
and
talked
more
than
enough
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
wish
you
would
leave
us
alone
shame
on
you
belle
said
i
consider
the
obligations
of
hospitality
i
am
sick
of
that
word
said
belle
you
are
so
frequently
misusing
it
were
this
place
not
mumpers
dingle
and
consequently
as
free
to
the
fellow
as
ourselves
i
would
lead
him
out
of
it
pray
be
quiet
belle
said
i
you
had
better
help
yourself
said
i
addressing
myself
to
the
man
in
black
the
lady
is
angry
with
you
i
am
sorry
for
it
said
the
man
in
black
if
she
is
angry
with
me
i
am
not
so
with
her
and
shall
be
always
proud
to
wait
upon
her
in
the
meantime
i
will
wait
upon
myself

the

in

having

to
some

of
his

and
tasted
it
i
thus
addressed
him
the
evening
is
getting
rather
advanced
and
i
can
see
that
this
lady
pointing
to
belle
is
anxious
for
her
tea
which
she
prefers
to
take
cosily
and
comfortably
with
me
in
the
dingle
the
place
it
is
true
is
as
free
to
you
as
to
ourselves
nevertheless
as
we
are
located
here
by
necessity
whilst
you
merely
come
as
a
visitor
i
must
take
the
liberty
of
telling
you
that
we
shall
be
glad
to
be
alone
as
soon
as
you
have
said
what
you
have
to
say
and
have
finished
the
glass
of
refreshment
at
present
in
your
hand
i
think
you
said
some
time
ago
that
one
of
your
motives
for
coming
hither
was
to
induce
me
to
enlist
under
the
banner
of
rome
i
wish
to
know
whether
that
was
really
the
case
decidedly
so
said
the
man
in
black
i
come
here
principally
in
the
hope
of
enlisting
you
in
our
regiment
in
which
i
have
no
doubt
you
could
do
us
excellent
service
would
you
enlist
my
companion
as
well
i
demanded
we
should
be
only
too
proud
to
have
her
among
us
whether
she
comes
with
you
or
alone
said
the
man
in
black
with
a
polite
bow
to
belle
before
we
give
you
an
answer
i
replied
i
would
fain
know
more
about
you
perhaps
you
will
declare
your
name
that
i
will
never
do
said
the
man
in
black
no
one
in
england
knows
it
but
myself
and
i
will
not
declare
it
even
in
a
dingle
as
for
the
rest
un
prete
cattolico
that
is
all
that
many
a
one
of
us
can
say
for
himself
and
it
assuredly
means
a
great
deal
we
will
now
proceed
to
business
said
i
you
must
be
aware
that
we
english
are
generally
considered
a
people
and
with
considerable
justice
said
the
man
in
black
drinking
well
you
are
a
person
of
acute
perception
and
i
will
presently
make
it
evident
to
you
that
it
would
be
to
your
interest
to
join
with
us
you
are
at
present
evidently
in
very
needy
circumstances
and
are
lost
not
only
to
yourself
but
to
the
world
but
should
you
enlist
with
us
i
could
find
you
an
occupation
not
only
agreeable
but
one
in
which
your
talents
would
have
free
scope
i
would
introduce
you
in
the
various
grand
houses
here
in
england
to
which
i
have
myself
admission
as
a
surprising
young
gentleman
of
infinite
learning
who
by
dint
of
study
has
discovered
that
the
roman
is
the
only
true
faith
i
tell
you
confidently
that
our
popish
females
would
make
a
saint
nay
a
god
of
you
they
are
fools
enough
for
anything
there
is
one
person
in
particular
with
whom
i
would
wish
to
make
you
acquainted
in
the
hope
that
you
would
be
able
to
help
me
to
perform
good
service
to
the
holy
see
he
is
a
gouty
old
fellow
of
some
learning
residing
in
an
old
hall
near
the
great
western
seaport
and
is
one
of
the
very
few
amongst
the
english
catholics
possessing
a
grain
of
sense
i
think
you
could
help
us
to
govern
him
for
he
is
not
unfrequently
disposed
to
be
restive
asks
us
strange
questions
occasionally
threatens
us
with
his
crutch
and
behaves
so
that
we
are
often
afraid
that
we
shall
lose
him
or
rather
his
property
which
he
has
bequeathed
to
us
and
which
is
enormous
i
am
sure
that
you
could
help
us
to
deal
with
him
sometimes
with
your
humour
sometimes
with
your
learning
and
perhaps
occasionally
with
your
fists
and
in
what
manner
would
you
provide
for
my
companion
said
i
we
would
place
her
at
once
said
the
man
in
black
in
the
house
of
two
highly
respectable
catholic
ladies
in
this
neighbourhood
where
she
would
be
treated
with
every
care
and
consideration
till
her
conversion
should
be
accomplished
in
a
regular
manner
we
would
then
remove
her
to
a
female
monastic
establishment
where
after
undergoing
a
year
probation
during
which
time
she
would
be
instructed
in
every
elegant
accomplishment
she
should
take
the
veil
her
advancement
would
speedily
follow
for
with
such
a
face
and
figure
she
would
make
a
capital
lady
abbess
especially
in
italy
to
which
country
she
would
probably
be
sent
ladies
of
her
hair
and
complexion
to
say
nothing
of
her
height
being
a
curiosity
in
the
south
with
a
little
care
and
management
she
could
soon
obtain
a
vast
reputation
for
sanctity
and
who
knows
but
after
her
death
she
might
become
a
glorified
saint
he
he
sister
maria
theresa
for
that
is
the
name
i
propose
you
should
bear
holy
mother
maria
theresa
glorified
and
celestial
saint
i
have
the
honour
of
drinking
to
your
health
and
the
man
in
black
drank
well
belle
said
i
what
have
you
to
say
to
the
proposal
that
if
he
goes
on
in
this
way
i
will
break
his
glass
against
his
mouth
you
have
heard
the
lady
answer
said
i
i
have
said
the
man
in
black
and
shall
not
press
the
matter
i
ca
help
however
repeating
that
she
would
make
a
capital
lady
abbess
she
would
keep
the
nuns
in
order
i
warrant
her
no
easy
matter
break
the
glass
against
my
mouth
he
he
how
she
would
send
the
holy
utensils
flying
at
the
nuns
heads
occasionally
and
just
the
person
to
wring
the
nose
of
satan
should
he
venture
to
appear
one
night
in
her
cell
in
the
shape
of
a
handsome
black
man
no
offence
madam
no
offence
pray
retain
your
seat
said
he
observing
that
belle
had
started
up
i
mean
no
offence
well
if
you
will
not
consent
to
be
an
abbess
perhaps
you
will
consent
to
follow
this
young
zingaro
and
to
with
him
and
us
i
am
a
priest
madam
and
can
join
you
both
in
an
instant
as
i
suppose
the
knot
has
not
been
tied
already
hold
your
mumping
gibberish
said
belle
and
leave
the
dingle
this
moment
for
though
is
free
to
every
one
you
have
no
right
to
insult
me
in
it
pray
be
pacified
said
i
to
belle
getting
up
and
placing
myself
between
her
and
the
man
in
black
he
will
presently
leave
take
my
word
for
it
there
sit
down
again
said
i
as
i
led
her
to
her
seat
then
resuming
my
own
i
said
to
the
man
in
black
i
advise
you
to
leave
the
dingle
as
soon
as
possible
i
should
wish
to
have
your
answer
to
my
proposal
first
said
he
well
then
here
you
shall
have
it
i
will
not
entertain
your
proposal
i
detest
your
schemes
they
are
both
wicked
and
foolish
wicked
said
the
man
in
black
have
they
not
he
he
the
furtherance
of
religion
in
view
a
religion
said
i
in
which
you
yourself
do
not
believe
and
which
you
contemn
whether
i
believe
in
it
or
not
said
the
man
in
black
it
is
adapted
for
the
generality
of
the
human
race
so
i
will
forward
it
and
advise
you
to
do
the
same
it
was
nearly
extirpated
in
these
regions
but
it
is
springing
up
again
owing
to
circumstances
radicalism
is
a
good
friend
to
us
all
the
liberals
laud
up
our
system
out
of
hatred
to
the
established
church
though
our
system
is
ten
times
less
liberal
than
the
church
of
england
some
of
them
have
really
come
over
to
us
i
myself
confess
a
baronet
who
presided
over
the
first
radical
meeting
ever
held
in
england
he
was
an
atheist
when
he
came
over
to
us
in
the
hope
of
mortifying
his
own
church
but
he
is
now
ho
ho
a
real
catholic
devotee
quite
afraid
of
my
threats
i
make
him
frequently
scourge
himself
before
me
well
radicalism
does
us
good
service
especially
amongst
the
lower
classes
for
radicalism
chiefly
flourishes
amongst
them
for
though
a
baronet
or
two
may
be
found
amongst
the
radicals
and
perhaps
as
many
lords
fellows
who
have
been
discarded
by
their
own
order
for
clownishness
or
something
they
have
done
it
incontestably
flourishes
best
among
the
lower
orders
then
the
love
of
what
is
foreign
is
a
great
friend
to
us
this
love
is
chiefly
confined
to
the
middle
and
upper
classes
some
admire
the
french
and
imitate
them
others
must
needs
be
spaniards
dress
themselves
up
in
a
zamarra
stick
a
cigar
in
their
mouth
and
say
others
would
pass
for
germans
he
he
the
idea
of
any
one
wishing
to
pass
for
a
german
but
what
has
done
us
more
service
than
anything
else
in
these
regions
i
mean
amidst
the
middle
classes
has
been
the
novel
the
scotch
novel
the
good
folks
since
they
have
read
the
novels
have
become
jacobites
and
because
all
the
jacobs
were
papists
the
good
folks
must
become
papists
also
or
at
least
papistically
inclined
the
very
scotch
presbyterians
since
they
have
read
the
novels
are
become
all
but
papists
i
speak
advisedly
having
lately
been
amongst
them
there
a
trumpery
bit
of
a
half
papist
sect
called
the
scotch
episcopalian
church
which
lay
dormant
and
nearly
forgotten
for
upwards
of
a
hundred
years
which
has
of
late
got
wonderfully
into
fashion
in
scotland
because
forsooth
some
of
the
haired
gentry
of
the
novels
were
said
to
belong
to
it
such
as
montrose
and
dundee
and
to
this
the
presbyterians
are
going
over
in
throngs
traducing
and
vilifying
their
own
forefathers
or
denying
them
altogether
and
calling
themselves
descendants
of
ho
ho
ho
scottish
cavaliers
i
have
heard
them
myself
repeating
snatches
of
jacobite
ditties
about
dundee
and
fill
up
my
cup
and
fill
up
my
can
and
saddle
my
horse
and
call
up
my
man
there
stuff
for
you
not
that
i
object
to
the
first
part
of
the
ditty
it
is
natural
enough
that
a
scotchman
should
cry
fill
up
my
cup
more
especially
if
he
drinking
at
another
person
expense
all
scotchmen
being
fond
of
liquor
at
free
cost
but
his
horse
for
what
purpose
i
would
ask
where
is
the
use
of
saddling
a
horse
unless
you
can
ride
him
and
where
was
there
ever
a
scotchman
who
could
ride
of
course
you
have
not
a
drop
of
scotch
blood
in
your
veins
said
i
otherwise
you
would
never
have
uttered
that
last
sentence
do
be
too
sure
of
that
said
the
man
in
black
you
know
little
of
popery
if
you
imagine
that
it
can
not
extinguish
love
of
country
even
in
a
scotchman
a
papist
and
who
more
than
myself
cares
nothing
for
his
country
and
why
should
he
he
belongs
to
a
system
and
not
to
a
country
one
thing
said
i
connected
with
you
i
can
not
understand
you
call
yourself
a
papist
yet
are
continually
saying
the
most
pungent
things
against
popery
and
turning
to
unbounded
ridicule
those
who
show
any
inclination
to
embrace
it
rome
is
a
very
sensible
old
body
said
the
man
in
black
and
little
cares
what
her
children
say
provided
they
do
her
bidding
she
knows
several
things
and
amongst
others
that
no
servants
work
so
hard
and
faithfully
as
those
who
curse
their
masters
at
every
stroke
they
do
she
was
not
fool
enough
to
be
angry
with
the
miquelets
of
alba
who
renounced
her
and
called
her
all
the
time
they
were
cutting
the
throats
of
the
netherlanders
now
if
she
allowed
her
faithful
soldiers
the
latitude
of
renouncing
her
and
calling
her
in
the
think
not
she
is
so
unreasonable
as
to
object
to
her
faithful
priests
occasionally
calling
her
in
the
dingle
but
said
i
suppose
some
one
were
to
tell
the
world
some
of
the
disorderly
things
which
her
priests
say
in
the
dingle
he
would
have
the
fate
of
cassandra
said
the
man
in
black
no
one
would
believe
him
yes
the
priests
would
but
they
would
make
no
sign
of
belief
they
believe
in
the
alcoran
des
cordeliers
that
is
those
who
have
read
it
but
they
make
no
sign
a
pretty
system
said
i
which
extinguishes
love
of
country
and
of
everything
noble
and
brings
the
minds
of
its
ministers
to
a
parity
with
those
of
devils
who
delight
in
nothing
but
mischief
the
system
said
the
man
in
black
is
a
grand
one
with
unbounded
vitality
compare
it
with
your
protestantism
and
you
will
see
the
difference
popery
is
ever
at
work
whilst
protestantism
is
supine
a
pretty
church
indeed
the
protestant
why
it
ca
even
work
a
miracle
can
your
church
work
miracles
i
demanded
that
was
the
very
question
said
the
man
in
black
which
the
ancient
british
clergy
asked
of
austin
monk
after
they
had
been
fools
enough
to
acknowledge
their
own
inability
do
pretend
to
work
miracles
do
you
dear
me
yes
said
austin
find
no
difficulty
in
the
matter
we
can
raise
the
dead
we
can
make
the
blind
see
and
to
convince
you
i
will
give
sight
to
the
blind
here
is
this
blind
saxon
whom
you
can
not
cure
but
on
whose
eyes
i
will
manifest
my
power
in
order
to
show
the
difference
between
the
true
and
the
false
church
and
forthwith
with
the
assistance
of
a
handkerchief
and
a
little
hot
water
he
opened
the
eyes
of
the
barbarian
so
we
manage
matters
a
pretty
church
that
old
british
church
which
could
not
work
miracles
quite
as
helpless
as
the
modern
one
the
fools
was
birdlime
so
scarce
a
thing
amongst
them
and
were
the
properties
of
warm
water
so
unknown
to
them
that
they
could
not
close
a
pair
of
eyes
and
open
them
it
a
pity
said
i
that
the
british
clergy
at
that
interview
with
austin
did
not
bring
forward
a
blind
welshman
and
ask
the
monk
to
operate
upon
him
clearly
said
the
man
in
black
that
what
they
ought
to
have
done
but
they
were
fools
without
a
single
resource
here
he
took
a
sip
at
his
glass
but
they
did
not
believe
in
the
miracle
said
i
and
what
did
their
not
believing
avail
them
said
the
man
in
black
austin
remained
master
of
the
field
and
they
went
away
holding
their
heads
down
and
muttering
to
themselves
what
a
fine
subject
for
a
painting
would
be
austin
opening
the
eyes
of
the
saxon
barbarian
and
the
discomfiture
of
the
british
clergy
i
wonder
it
has
not
been
painted
he
he
i
suppose
your
church
still
performs
miracles
occasionally
said
i
it
does
said
the
man
in
black
the
rev
has
lately
been
performing
miracles
in
ireland
destroying
devils
that
had
got
possession
of
people
he
has
been
eminently
successful
in
two
instances
he
not
only
destroyed
the
devils
but
the
lives
of
the
people
possessed
he
he
oh
there
is
so
much
energy
in
our
system
we
are
always
at
work
whilst
protestantism
is
supine
you
must
not
imagine
said
i
that
all
protestants
are
supine
some
of
them
appear
to
be
filled
with
unbounded
zeal
they
deal
it
is
true
not
in
lying
miracles
but
they
propagate
god
word
i
remember
only
a
few
months
ago
having
occasion
for
a
bible
going
to
an
establishment
the
object
of
which
was
to
send
bibles
all
over
the
world
the
supporters
of
that
establishment
could
have
no
views
for
i
was
supplied
by
them
with
a
bible
at
a
price
so
small
as
to
preclude
the
idea
that
it
could
bring
any
profit
to
the
vendors
the
countenance
of
the
man
in
black
slightly
fell
i
know
the
people
to
whom
you
allude
said
he
indeed
unknown
to
them
i
have
frequently
been
to
see
them
and
observed
their
ways
i
tell
you
frankly
that
there
is
not
a
set
of
people
in
this
kingdom
who
have
caused
our
church
so
much
trouble
and
uneasiness
i
should
rather
say
that
they
alone
cause
us
any
for
as
for
the
rest
what
with
their
drowsiness
their
plethora
their
folly
and
their
vanity
they
are
doing
us
anything
but
mischief
these
fellows
are
a
pestilent
set
of
heretics
whom
we
would
gladly
see
burnt
they
are
with
the
most
untiring
perseverance
and
in
spite
of
divers
minatory
declarations
of
the
holy
father
scattering
their
books
abroad
through
all
europe
and
have
caused
many
people
in
catholic
countries
to
think
that
hitherto
their
priesthood
have
endeavoured
as
much
as
possible
to
keep
them
blinded
there
is
one
fellow
amongst
them
for
whom
we
entertain
a
particular
aversion
a
big
burly
parson
with
the
face
of
a
lion
the
voice
of
a
buffalo
and
a
fist
like
a
the
last
time
i
was
there
i
observed
that
his
eye
was
upon
me
and
i
did
not
like
the
glance
he
gave
me
at
all
i
observed
him
clench
his
fist
and
i
took
my
departure
as
fast
as
i
conveniently
could
whether
he
suspected
who
i
was
i
know
not
but
i
did
not
like
his
look
at
all
and
do
not
intend
to
go
again
well
then
said
i
you
confess
that
you
have
redoubtable
enemies
to
your
plans
in
these
regions
and
that
even
amongst
the
ecclesiastics
there
are
some
widely
different
from
those
of
the
plethoric
and
platitude
schools
it
is
but
too
true
said
the
man
in
black
and
if
the
rest
of
your
church
were
like
them
we
should
quickly
bid
adieu
to
all
hope
of
converting
these
regions
but
we
are
thankful
to
be
able
to
say
that
such
folks
are
not
numerous
there
are
moreover
causes
at
work
quite
sufficient
to
undermine
even
their
zeal
their
sons
return
at
the
vacations
from
oxford
and
cambridge
puppies
full
of
the
nonsense
which
they
have
imbibed
from
platitude
professors
and
this
nonsense
they
retail
at
home
where
it
fails
not
to
make
some
impression
whilst
the
daughters
scream
i
beg
their
pardons
warble
about
scotland
montrose
and
bonny
dundee
and
all
the
jacobs
so
we
have
no
doubt
that
their
papas
zeal
about
the
propagation
of
such
a
vulgar
book
as
the
bible
will
in
a
very
little
time
be
terribly
diminished
old
rome
will
win
so
you
had
better
join
her
and
the
man
in
black
drained
the
last
drop
in
his
glass
never
said
i
will
i
become
the
slave
of
rome
she
will
allow
you
latitude
said
the
man
in
black
do
but
serve
her
and
she
will
allow
you
to
call
her
at
a
decent
time
and
place
her
popes
occasionally
call
her
a
pope
has
been
known
to
start
from
his
bed
at
midnight
and
rush
out
into
the
corridor
and
call
out
three
times
in
a
voice
which
pierced
the
vatican
that
pope
was
alexander
the
sixth
i
dare
say
said
i
the
greatest
monster
that
ever
existed
though
the
worthiest
head
which
the
pope
system
ever
had
so
his
conscience
was
not
always
still
i
thought
it
had
been
seared
with
a
brand
of
iron
i
did
not
allude
to
him
but
to
a
much
more
modern
pope
said
the
man
in
black
it
is
true
he
brought
the
word
which
is
spanish
from
spain
his
native
country
to
rome
he
was
very
fond
of
calling
the
church
by
that
name
and
other
popes
have
taken
it
up
she
will
allow
you
to
call
her
by
it
if
you
belong
to
her
i
shall
call
her
so
said
i
without
belonging
to
her
or
asking
her
permission
she
will
allow
you
to
treat
her
as
such
if
you
belong
to
her
said
the
man
in
black
there
is
a
chapel
in
rome
where
there
is
a
wondrously
fair
statue
the
son
of
a
cardinal
i
mean
his
nephew
once
well
she
did
not
cut
off
his
head
but
slightly
boxed
his
cheek
and
bade
him
go
i
have
read
all
about
that
in
travels
said
i
do
you
tell
her
that
i
would
not
touch
her
with
a
pair
of
tongs
unless
to
seize
her
nose
she
is
fond
of
lucre
said
the
man
in
black
but
does
not
grudge
a
faithful
priest
a
little
private
perquisite
and
he
took
out
a
very
handsome
gold
repeater
are
you
not
afraid
said
i
to
flash
that
watch
before
the
eyes
of
a
poor
tinker
in
a
dingle
not
before
the
eyes
of
one
like
you
said
the
man
in
black
it
is
getting
late
said
i
i
care
not
for
perquisites
so
you
will
not
join
us
said
the
man
in
black
you
have
had
my
answer
said
i
if
i
belong
to
rome
said
the
man
in
black
why
should
not
you
i
may
be
a
poor
tinker
said
i
but
i
may
never
have
undergone
what
you
have
you
remember
perhaps
the
fable
of
the
fox
who
had
lost
his
tail
the
man
in
black
winced
but
almost
immediately
recovering
himself
he
said
well
we
can
do
without
you
we
are
sure
of
winning
it
is
not
the
part
of
wise
people
said
i
to
make
sure
of
the
battle
before
it
is
fought
there
the
landlord
of
the
who
made
sure
that
his
cocks
would
win
yet
the
cocks
lost
the
main
and
the
landlord
is
little
better
than
a
bankrupt
people
very
different
from
the
landlord
said
the
man
in
black
both
in
intellect
and
station
think
we
shall
surely
win
there
are
clever
machinators
among
us
who
have
no
doubt
of
our
success
well
said
i
i
will
set
the
landlord
aside
and
will
adduce
one
who
was
in
every
point
a
very
different
person
from
the
landlord
both
in
understanding
and
station
he
was
very
fond
of
laying
schemes
and
indeed
many
of
them
turned
out
successful
his
last
and
darling
one
however
miscarried
notwithstanding
that
by
his
calculations
he
had
persuaded
himself
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
its
failing
the
person
that
i
allude
to
was
old
fraser
who
said
the
man
in
black
giving
a
start
and
letting
his
glass
fall
old
fraser
of
lovat
said
i
the
prince
of
all
conspirators
and
machinators
he
made
sure
of
placing
the
pretender
on
the
throne
of
these
realms
can
bring
into
the
field
so
many
men
said
he
law
cluny
so
many
and
likewise
my
cousin
and
my
good
friend
then
speaking
of
those
on
whom
the
government
reckoned
for
support
he
would
say
and
so
are
lukewarm
this
person
is
ruled
by
his
wife
who
is
with
us
the
clergy
are
anything
but
hostile
to
us
and
as
for
the
soldiers
and
sailors
half
are
disaffected
to
king
george
and
the
rest
cowards
yet
when
things
came
to
a
trial
this
person
whom
he
had
calculated
upon
to
join
the
pretender
did
not
stir
from
his
home
another
joined
the
hostile
ranks
the
presumed
cowards
turned
out
heroes
and
those
whom
he
thought
heroes
ran
away
like
lusty
fellows
at
culloden
in
a
word
he
found
himself
utterly
mistaken
and
in
nothing
more
than
in
himself
he
thought
he
was
a
hero
and
proved
himself
nothing
more
than
an
old
fox
he
got
up
a
hollow
tree
did
he
just
like
a
fox
sue
non
furon
leonine
ma
di
volpe
the
man
in
black
sat
silent
for
a
considerable
time
and
at
length
answered
in
rather
a
faltering
voice
i
was
not
prepared
for
this
you
have
frequently
surprised
me
by
your
knowledge
of
things
which
i
should
never
have
expected
any
person
of
your
appearance
to
be
acquainted
with
but
that
you
should
be
aware
of
my
name
is
a
circumstance
utterly
incomprehensible
to
me
i
had
imagined
that
no
person
in
england
was
acquainted
with
it
indeed
i
do
see
how
any
person
should
be
i
have
revealed
it
to
no
one
not
being
particularly
proud
of
it
yes
i
acknowledge
that
my
name
is
fraser
and
that
i
am
of
the
blood
of
that
family
or
clan
of
which
the
rector
of
our
college
once
said
that
he
was
firmly
of
opinion
that
every
individual
member
was
either
rogue
or
fool
i
was
born
at
madrid
of
pure
fraser
blood
my
parents
at
an
early
age
took
me
to
where
they
shortly
died
not
however
before
they
had
placed
me
in
the
service
of
a
cardinal
with
whom
i
continued
for
some
years
and
who
when
he
had
no
further
occasion
for
me
sent
me
to
the
college
in
the
cloister
of
which
as
you
enter
rest
the
bones
of
sir
john
there
in
studying
logic
and
humane
letters
i
lost
whatever
of
humanity
i
had
retained
when
discarded
by
the
cardinal
let
me
not
however
forget
two
points
i
am
a
fraser
it
is
true
but
not
a
flannagan
i
may
bear
the
vilest
name
of
britain
but
not
of
ireland
i
was
bred
up
at
the
english
house
and
there
is
at
a
house
for
the
education
of
bogtrotters
i
was
not
bred
up
at
that
beneath
the
lowest
gulf
there
is
one
yet
lower
whatever
my
blood
may
be
it
is
at
least
not
irish
whatever
my
education
may
have
been
i
was
not
bred
at
the
irish
seminary
on
those
accounts
i
am
thankful
yes
i
am
thankful
after
some
years
at
college
but
why
should
i
tell
you
my
history
you
know
it
already
perfectly
well
probably
much
better
than
myself
i
am
now
a
missionary
priest
labouring
in
heretic
england
like
parsons
and
garnet
of
old
save
and
except
that
unlike
them
i
run
no
danger
for
the
times
are
changed
as
i
told
you
before
i
shall
cleave
to
rome
i
must
hay
as
they
say
at
madrid
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
further
her
holy
plans
he
he
but
i
confess
i
begin
to
doubt
of
their
being
successful
here
you
put
me
out
old
fraser
of
lovat
i
have
heard
my
father
talk
of
him
he
had
a
cane
with
which
he
once
knocked
my
grandfather
down
he
was
an
astute
one
but
as
you
say
mistaken
particularly
in
himself
i
have
read
his
life
by
arbuthnot
it
is
in
the
library
of
our
college
farewell
i
shall
come
no
more
to
this
dingle
to
come
would
be
of
no
utility
i
shall
go
and
labour
elsewhere
though
how
you
came
to
know
my
name
is
a
fact
quite
inexplicable
farewell
to
you
both
he
then
arose
and
without
further
salutation
departed
from
the
dingle
in
which
i
never
saw
him
again
how
in
the
name
of
wonder
came
you
to
know
that
man
name
said
belle
after
he
had
been
gone
some
time
i
belle
i
knew
nothing
of
the
fellow
name
i
assure
you
but
you
mentioned
his
name
if
i
did
it
was
merely
casually
by
way
of
illustration
i
was
saying
how
frequently
cunning
people
were
mistaken
in
their
calculations
and
i
adduced
the
case
of
old
fraser
of
lovat
as
one
in
point
i
brought
forward
his
name
because
i
was
well
acquainted
with
his
history
from
having
compiled
and
inserted
it
in
a
wonderful
work
which
i
edited
some
months
ago
entitled
lives
and
trials
but
without
the
slightest
idea
that
it
was
the
name
of
him
who
was
sitting
with
us
he
however
thought
that
i
was
aware
of
his
name
belle
belle
for
a
long
time
i
doubted
the
truth
of
scripture
owing
to
certain
conceited
individuals
but
now
i
begin
to
believe
firmly
what
wonderful
texts
are
in
scripture
belle
wicked
trembleth
where
where
were
afraid
where
no
fear
was
thou
hast
put
them
to
confusion
because
god
hath
despised
them
said
belle
i
have
frequently
read
it
before
the
clergyman
in
the
great
house
of
long
melford
but
if
you
did
not
know
the
man
name
why
let
him
go
away
supposing
that
you
did
oh
if
he
was
fool
enough
to
make
such
a
mistake
i
was
not
going
to
undeceive
him
no
no
let
the
enemies
of
old
england
make
the
most
of
all
their
blunders
and
mistakes
they
will
have
no
help
from
me
but
enough
of
the
fellow
belle
let
us
now
have
tea
and
after
that
no
armenian
said
belle
but
i
want
to
ask
a
question
pray
are
all
people
of
that
man
name
either
rogues
or
fools
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
belle
this
person
being
the
only
one
of
the
name
i
have
ever
personally
known
i
suppose
there
are
good
and
bad
clever
and
foolish
amongst
them
as
amongst
all
large
bodies
of
people
however
after
the
tribe
had
been
governed
for
upwards
of
thirty
years
by
such
a
person
as
old
fraser
it
were
no
wonder
if
the
greater
part
had
become
either
rogues
or
fools
he
was
a
ruthless
tyrant
belle
over
his
own
people
and
by
his
cruelty
and
rapaciousness
must
either
have
stunned
them
into
an
apathy
approaching
to
idiotcy
or
made
them
artful
knaves
in
their
own
defence
the
qualities
of
parents
are
generally
transmitted
to
their
descendants
the
progeny
of
trained
pointers
are
almost
sure
to
point
even
without
being
taught
if
therefore
all
frasers
are
either
rogues
or
fools
as
this
person
seems
to
insinuate
it
is
little
to
be
wondered
at
their
parents
or
grandparents
having
been
in
the
school
of
old
fraser
but
enough
of
the
old
tyrant
and
his
slaves
belle
prepare
tea
this
moment
or
dread
my
anger
i
have
not
a
headed
cane
like
old
fraser
of
lovat
but
i
have
what
some
people
would
dread
much
more
an
armenian
chapter
v
fresh
arrivals
pitching
the
tent
certificated
wife
notions
on
the
following
morning
as
i
was
about
to
leave
my
tent
i
heard
the
voice
of
belle
at
the
door
exclaiming
sleepest
thou
or
wakest
thou
i
was
never
more
awake
in
my
life
said
i
going
out
what
is
the
matter
he
of
the
said
she
jasper
of
whom
i
have
heard
you
talk
is
above
there
on
the
field
with
all
his
people
i
went
out
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
to
fill
the
kettle
at
the
spring
and
saw
them
arriving
it
is
well
said
i
have
you
any
objection
to
asking
him
and
his
wife
to
breakfast
you
can
do
as
you
please
said
she
i
have
cups
enough
and
have
no
objection
to
their
company
we
are
the
first
occupiers
of
the
ground
said
i
and
being
so
should
consider
ourselves
in
the
light
of
hosts
and
do
our
best
to
practise
the
duties
of
hospitality
how
fond
you
are
of
using
that
word
said
belle
if
you
wish
to
invite
the
man
and
his
wife
do
so
without
more
ado
remember
however
that
i
have
not
cups
enough
nor
indeed
tea
enough
for
the
whole
company
thereupon
hurrying
up
the
ascent
i
presently
found
myself
outside
the
dingle
it
was
as
usual
a
brilliant
morning
the
dewy
blades
of
the
which
covered
the
plain
sparkled
brightly
in
the
beams
of
the
sun
which
had
probably
been
about
two
hours
above
the
horizon
a
rather
numerous
body
of
my
ancient
friends
and
allies
occupied
the
ground
in
the
vicinity
of
the
mouth
of
the
dingle
about
five
yards
on
the
right
i
perceived
petulengro
busily
employed
in
erecting
his
tent
he
held
in
his
hand
an
iron
bar
sharp
at
the
bottom
with
a
kind
of
arm
projecting
from
the
top
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
a
kettle
or
cauldron
over
the
fire
and
which
is
called
in
the
romanian
language
kekauviskoe
saster
with
the
sharp
end
of
this
petulengro
was
making
holes
in
the
earth
at
about
twenty
inches
distant
from
each
other
into
which
he
inserted
certain
long
rods
with
a
considerable
bend
towards
the
top
which
constituted
no
less
than
the
timber
of
the
tent
and
the
supporters
of
the
canvas
petulengro
and
a
female
with
a
crutch
in
her
hand
whom
i
recognised
as
chikno
sat
near
him
on
the
ground
whilst
two
or
three
children
from
six
to
ten
years
old
who
composed
the
young
family
of
and
petulengro
were
playing
about
here
we
are
brother
said
petulengro
as
he
drove
the
sharp
end
of
the
bar
into
the
ground
here
we
are
and
plenty
of
us
bute
dosta
romany
chals
i
am
glad
to
see
you
all
said
i
and
particularly
you
madam
said
i
making
a
bow
to
petulengro
and
you
also
madam
taking
off
my
hat
to
chikno
to
you
sir
said
petulengro
you
look
as
usual
charmingly
and
speak
so
too
you
have
not
forgot
your
manners
it
is
not
all
gold
that
glitters
said
chikno
however
morrow
to
you
young
rye
i
do
not
see
tawno
said
i
looking
around
where
is
he
where
indeed
said
chikno
i
do
know
he
who
countenances
him
in
the
roving
line
can
best
answer
he
will
be
here
anon
said
petulengro
he
has
merely
ridden
down
a
to
show
a
farmer
a
colt
she
heard
me
give
him
directions
but
she
ca
be
satisfied
i
ca
indeed
said
chikno
and
why
not
sister
because
i
place
no
confidence
in
your
words
brother
as
i
said
before
you
countenances
him
well
said
i
i
know
nothing
of
your
private
concerns
i
am
come
on
an
errand
isopel
berners
down
in
the
dell
there
requests
the
pleasure
of
and
petulengro
company
at
breakfast
she
will
be
happy
also
to
see
you
madam
said
i
addressing
chikno
is
that
young
female
your
wife
young
man
said
chikno
my
wife
said
i
yes
young
man
your
wife
your
lawful
certificated
wife
no
said
i
she
is
not
my
wife
then
i
will
not
visit
with
her
said
chikno
i
countenance
nothing
in
the
roving
line
what
do
you
mean
by
the
roving
line
i
demanded
what
do
i
mean
by
the
roving
line
why
by
it
i
mean
such
conduct
as
is
not
tatcheno
when
ryes
and
rawnies
live
together
in
dingles
without
being
certificated
i
call
such
behaviour
being
tolerably
deep
in
the
roving
line
everything
savouring
of
which
i
am
determined
not
to
sanctify
i
have
suffered
too
much
by
my
own
certificated
outbreaks
in
that
line
to
afford
anything
of
the
kind
the
slightest
shadow
of
countenance
it
is
hard
that
people
may
not
live
in
dingles
together
without
being
suspected
of
doing
wrong
said
i
so
it
is
said
petulengro
interposing
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
altogether
surprised
at
the
illiberality
of
my
remarks
i
have
often
heard
say
that
it
is
in
good
company
and
i
have
kept
good
company
in
my
time
that
suspicion
is
king
evidence
of
a
narrow
and
uncultivated
mind
on
which
account
i
am
suspicious
of
nobody
not
even
of
my
own
husband
whom
some
people
would
think
i
have
a
right
to
be
suspicious
of
seeing
that
on
his
account
i
once
refused
a
lord
but
ask
him
whether
i
am
suspicious
of
him
and
whether
i
seek
to
keep
him
close
tied
to
my
he
will
tell
you
nothing
of
the
kind
but
that
on
the
contrary
i
always
allows
him
an
agreeable
latitude
permitting
him
to
go
where
he
pleases
and
to
converse
with
any
one
to
whose
manner
of
speaking
he
may
take
a
fancy
but
i
have
had
the
advantage
of
keeping
good
company
and
therefore
meklis
said
chikno
pray
drop
all
that
sister
i
believe
i
have
kept
as
good
company
as
yourself
and
with
respect
to
that
offer
with
which
you
frequently
fatigue
those
who
keeps
company
with
you
i
believe
after
all
it
was
something
in
the
roving
and
uncertificated
line
in
whatever
line
it
was
said
petulengro
the
offer
was
a
good
one
the
young
duke
for
he
was
not
only
a
lord
but
a
duke
too
offered
to
keep
me
a
fine
carriage
and
to
make
me
his
second
wife
for
it
is
true
that
he
had
another
who
was
old
and
stout
though
mighty
rich
and
highly
so
much
so
indeed
that
the
young
lord
assured
me
that
she
would
have
no
manner
of
objection
to
the
arrangement
more
especially
if
i
would
consent
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
her
being
fond
of
young
and
cheerful
society
so
you
see
yes
yes
said
chikno
i
see
what
i
before
thought
that
it
was
altogether
in
the
uncertificated
line
meklis
said
petulengro
i
use
your
own
word
madam
which
is
romany
for
my
own
part
i
am
not
fond
of
using
romany
words
unless
i
can
hope
to
pass
them
off
for
french
which
i
can
not
in
the
present
company
i
heartily
wish
that
there
was
no
such
language
and
do
my
best
to
keep
it
away
from
my
children
lest
the
frequent
use
of
it
should
altogether
confirm
them
in
low
and
vulgar
habits
i
have
four
children
madam
but
i
suppose
by
talking
of
your
four
children
you
wish
to
check
me
for
having
none
said
chikno
bursting
into
tears
if
i
have
no
children
sister
it
is
no
fault
of
mine
it
is
but
why
do
i
call
you
sister
said
she
angrily
you
are
no
sister
of
mine
you
are
a
grasni
a
regular
mare
a
pretty
sister
indeed
ashamed
of
your
own
language
i
remember
well
that
by
your
notions
you
drove
your
own
mother
we
will
drop
it
said
petulengro
i
do
not
wish
to
raise
my
voice
and
to
make
myself
ridiculous
young
gentleman
said
she
pray
present
my
compliments
to
miss
isopel
berners
and
inform
her
that
i
am
very
sorry
that
i
can
not
accept
her
polite
invitation
i
am
just
arrived
and
have
some
slight
domestic
matters
to
see
to
amongst
others
to
wash
my
children
faces
but
that
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
when
i
have
attended
to
what
i
have
to
do
and
have
dressed
myself
i
hope
to
do
myself
the
honour
of
paying
her
a
regular
visit
you
will
tell
her
that
with
my
compliments
with
respect
to
my
husband
he
can
answer
for
himself
as
i
not
being
of
a
jealous
disposition
never
interferes
with
his
matters
and
tell
miss
berners
said
petulengro
that
i
shall
be
happy
to
wait
upon
her
in
company
with
my
wife
as
soon
as
we
are
regularly
settled
at
present
i
have
much
on
my
hands
having
not
only
to
pitch
my
own
tent
but
this
here
jealous
woman
whose
husband
is
absent
on
my
business
thereupon
i
returned
to
the
dingle
and
without
saying
anything
about
chikno
observations
communicated
to
isopel
the
messages
of
and
petulengro
isopel
made
no
other
reply
than
by
replacing
in
her
coffer
two
additional
cups
and
saucers
which
in
expectation
of
company
she
had
placed
upon
the
board
the
kettle
was
by
this
time
boiling
we
sat
down
and
as
we
breakfasted
i
gave
isopel
berners
another
lesson
in
the
armenian
language
chapter
vi
the
promised
visit
roman
fashion
wizard
and
witch
catching
at
words
the
two
females
dressing
of
hair
the
new
roads
belle
altered
appearance
herself
again
about
and
petulengro
came
to
the
dingle
to
pay
the
promised
visit
belle
at
the
time
of
their
arrival
was
in
her
tent
but
i
was
at
the
engaged
in
hammering
part
of
the
or
defence
which
had
come
off
from
one
of
the
wheels
of
my
vehicle
on
perceiving
them
i
forthwith
went
to
receive
them
petulengro
was
dressed
in
roman
fashion
with
a
somewhat
the
buttons
of
which
were
and
a
waistcoat
scarlet
and
black
the
buttons
of
which
were
spaded
his
breeches
were
of
a
stuff
half
velveteen
half
corduroy
the
cords
exceedingly
broad
he
had
leggings
of
buff
cloth
furred
at
the
bottom
and
upon
his
feet
were
highlows
under
his
left
arm
was
a
long
black
whalebone
with
a
red
lash
and
an
immense
silver
knob
upon
his
head
was
a
hat
with
a
high
peak
somewhat
of
the
kind
which
the
spaniards
call
so
much
in
favour
with
the
bravos
of
seville
and
madrid
now
when
i
have
added
that
petulengro
had
on
a
very
fine
white
holland
shirt
i
think
i
have
described
his
array
petulengro
i
beg
pardon
for
not
having
spoken
of
her
first
was
also
arrayed
very
much
in
the
roman
fashion
her
hair
which
was
exceedingly
black
and
lustrous
fell
in
braids
on
either
side
of
her
head
in
her
ears
were
rings
with
long
drops
of
gold
round
her
neck
was
a
string
of
what
seemed
very
much
like
very
large
pearls
somewhat
tarnished
however
and
apparently
of
considerable
antiquity
here
we
are
brother
said
petulengro
here
we
are
come
to
see
you
wizard
and
witch
witch
and
wizard
a
chovahanee
and
a
chovahano
the
nav
se
len
is
petulengro
hold
your
tongue
sir
said
petulengro
you
make
me
ashamed
of
you
with
your
vulgar
ditties
we
are
come
a
visiting
now
and
everything
low
should
be
left
behind
true
said
petulengro
why
bring
what
low
to
the
dingle
which
is
low
enough
already
what
are
you
a
catcher
at
words
said
i
i
thought
that
catching
at
words
had
been
confined
to
the
pothouse
farmers
and
village
witty
bodies
all
fools
said
petulengro
catch
at
words
and
very
naturally
as
by
so
doing
they
hope
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
rational
conversation
catching
at
words
confined
to
pothouse
farmers
and
village
witty
bodies
no
not
to
jasper
petulengro
listen
for
an
hour
or
two
to
the
discourse
of
a
set
they
call
newspaper
editors
and
if
you
do
go
out
and
eat
grass
as
a
dog
does
when
he
is
sick
i
am
no
female
woman
the
young
lord
whose
hand
i
refused
when
i
took
up
with
wise
jasper
once
brought
two
of
them
to
my
mother
tan
when
hankering
after
my
company
they
did
nothing
but
carp
at
each
other
words
and
a
pretty
hand
they
made
of
it
dogs
they
were
and
their
attempts
at
what
they
called
wit
almost
as
unfortunate
as
their
countenances
well
said
i
madam
we
will
drop
all
catchings
and
carpings
for
the
present
pray
take
your
seat
on
this
stool
whilst
i
go
and
announce
to
miss
isopel
berners
your
arrival
thereupon
i
went
to
belle
habitation
and
informed
her
that
and
petulengro
had
paid
us
a
visit
of
ceremony
and
were
awaiting
her
at
the
pray
go
and
tell
them
that
i
am
busy
said
belle
who
was
engaged
with
her
needle
i
do
not
feel
disposed
to
take
part
in
any
such
nonsense
i
shall
do
no
such
thing
said
i
and
i
insist
upon
your
coming
forthwith
and
showing
proper
courtesy
to
your
visitors
if
you
do
not
their
feelings
will
be
hurt
and
you
are
aware
that
i
can
not
bear
that
people
feelings
should
be
outraged
come
this
moment
or
or
what
said
belle
half
smiling
i
was
about
to
say
something
in
armenian
said
i
well
said
belle
laying
down
her
work
i
will
come
stay
said
i
your
hair
is
hanging
about
your
ears
and
your
dress
is
in
disorder
you
had
better
stay
a
minute
or
two
to
prepare
yourself
to
appear
before
your
visitors
who
have
come
in
their
very
best
attire
no
said
belle
i
will
make
no
alteration
in
my
appearance
you
told
me
to
come
this
moment
and
you
shall
be
obeyed
so
belle
and
i
advanced
towards
our
guests
as
we
drew
nigh
petulengro
took
off
his
hat
and
made
a
profound
obeisance
to
belle
whilst
petulengro
rose
from
the
stool
and
made
a
profound
curtsey
belle
who
had
flung
her
hair
back
over
her
shoulders
returned
their
salutations
by
bending
her
head
and
after
slightly
glancing
at
petulengro
fixed
her
large
blue
eyes
full
upon
his
wife
both
these
females
were
very
handsome
but
how
unlike
belle
fair
with
blue
eyes
and
flaxen
hair
petulengro
with
olive
complexion
eyes
black
and
hair
dark
as
dark
as
could
be
belle
in
demeanour
calm
and
proud
the
gypsy
graceful
but
full
of
movement
and
agitation
and
then
how
different
were
those
two
in
stature
the
head
of
the
romany
rawnie
scarcely
ascended
to
the
breast
of
isopel
berners
i
could
see
that
petulengro
gazed
on
belle
with
unmixed
admiration
so
did
her
husband
well
said
the
latter
one
thing
i
will
say
which
is
that
there
is
only
one
on
earth
worthy
to
stand
up
in
front
of
this
she
and
that
is
the
beauty
of
the
world
as
far
as
man
flesh
is
concerned
tawno
chikno
what
a
pity
he
did
not
come
down
tawno
chikno
said
petulengro
flaring
up
a
pretty
fellow
he
to
stand
up
in
front
of
this
gentlewoman
a
pity
he
did
come
quotha
not
at
all
the
fellow
is
a
sneak
afraid
of
his
wife
he
stand
up
against
this
rawnie
why
the
look
she
has
given
me
would
knock
the
fellow
down
it
is
easier
to
knock
him
down
with
a
look
than
with
a
fist
said
petulengro
that
is
if
the
look
comes
from
a
woman
not
that
i
am
disposed
to
doubt
that
this
female
gentlewoman
is
able
to
knock
him
down
either
one
way
or
the
other
i
have
heard
of
her
often
enough
and
have
seen
her
once
or
twice
though
not
so
near
as
now
well
my
wife
and
i
are
come
to
pay
our
respects
to
you
we
are
both
glad
to
find
that
you
have
left
off
keeping
company
with
flaming
bosville
and
have
taken
up
with
my
pal
he
is
not
very
handsome
but
a
better
i
take
up
with
your
pal
as
you
call
him
you
had
better
mind
what
you
say
said
isopel
berners
i
take
up
with
nobody
i
merely
mean
taking
up
your
quarters
with
him
said
petulengro
and
i
was
only
about
to
say
a
better
you
can
not
have
or
a
more
instructive
especially
if
you
have
a
desire
to
be
inoculated
with
tongues
as
he
calls
them
i
wonder
whether
you
and
he
have
had
any
already
have
you
and
your
wife
anything
particular
to
say
if
you
have
nothing
but
this
kind
of
conversation
i
must
leave
you
as
i
am
going
to
make
a
journey
this
afternoon
and
should
be
getting
ready
you
must
excuse
my
husband
madam
said
petulengro
he
is
not
overburdened
with
understanding
and
has
said
but
one
word
of
sense
since
he
has
been
here
which
was
that
we
came
to
pay
our
respects
to
you
we
have
dressed
ourselves
in
our
best
roman
way
in
order
to
do
honour
to
you
perhaps
you
do
not
like
it
if
so
i
am
sorry
i
have
no
french
clothes
madam
if
i
had
any
madam
i
would
have
come
in
them
in
order
to
do
you
more
honour
i
like
to
see
you
much
better
as
you
are
said
belle
people
should
keep
to
their
own
fashions
and
yours
is
very
pretty
i
am
glad
you
are
pleased
to
think
it
so
madam
it
has
been
admired
in
the
great
city
it
created
what
they
call
a
sensation
and
some
of
the
great
ladies
the
court
ladies
imitated
it
else
i
should
not
appear
in
it
so
often
as
i
am
accustomed
for
i
am
not
very
fond
of
what
is
roman
having
an
imagination
that
what
is
roman
is
ungenteel
in
fact
i
once
heard
the
wife
of
a
rich
citizen
say
that
gypsies
were
vulgar
creatures
i
should
have
taken
her
saying
very
much
to
heart
but
for
her
improper
pronunciation
she
could
not
pronounce
her
words
madam
which
we
gypsies
as
they
call
us
usually
can
so
i
thought
she
was
no
very
high
purchase
you
are
very
beautiful
madam
though
you
are
not
dressed
as
i
could
wish
to
see
you
and
your
hair
is
hanging
down
in
sad
confusion
allow
me
to
assist
you
in
arranging
your
hair
madam
i
will
dress
it
for
you
in
our
fashion
i
would
fain
see
how
your
hair
would
look
in
our
poor
gypsy
fashion
pray
allow
me
madam
and
she
took
belle
by
the
hand
i
really
can
do
no
such
thing
said
belle
withdrawing
her
hand
i
thank
you
for
coming
to
see
me
but
do
allow
me
to
officiate
upon
your
hair
madam
said
petulengro
i
should
esteem
your
allowing
me
a
great
mark
of
condescension
you
are
very
beautiful
madam
and
i
think
you
doubly
so
because
you
are
so
fair
i
have
a
great
esteem
for
persons
with
fair
complexions
and
hair
i
have
a
less
regard
for
people
with
dark
hair
and
complexions
madam
then
why
did
you
turn
off
the
lord
and
take
up
with
me
said
petulengro
that
same
lord
was
fair
enough
all
about
him
people
do
when
they
are
young
and
silly
what
they
sometimes
repent
of
when
they
are
of
riper
years
and
understandings
i
sometimes
think
that
had
i
not
been
something
of
a
simpleton
i
might
at
this
time
be
a
great
court
lady
now
madam
said
she
again
taking
belle
by
the
hand
do
oblige
me
by
allowing
me
to
plait
your
hair
a
little
i
have
really
a
good
mind
to
be
angry
with
you
said
belle
giving
petulengro
a
peculiar
glance
do
allow
her
to
arrange
your
hair
said
i
she
means
no
harm
and
wishes
to
do
you
honour
do
oblige
her
and
me
too
for
i
should
like
to
see
how
your
hair
would
look
dressed
in
her
fashion
you
hear
what
the
young
rye
says
said
petulengro
i
am
sure
you
will
oblige
the
young
rye
if
not
myself
many
people
would
be
willing
to
oblige
the
young
rye
if
he
would
but
ask
them
but
he
is
not
in
the
habit
of
asking
favours
he
has
a
nose
of
his
own
which
he
keeps
tolerably
exalted
he
does
not
think
of
himself
madam
and
all
the
time
i
have
been
with
him
i
never
heard
him
ask
a
favour
before
therefore
madam
i
am
sure
you
will
oblige
him
my
sister
ursula
would
be
very
willing
to
oblige
him
in
many
things
but
he
will
not
ask
for
anything
except
for
such
a
favour
as
a
word
which
is
a
poor
favour
after
all
i
do
mean
for
her
word
perhaps
he
will
some
day
ask
you
for
your
word
if
so
why
here
you
are
after
railing
at
me
for
catching
at
words
catching
at
a
word
yourself
said
petulengro
hold
your
tongue
sir
said
petulengro
do
interrupt
me
in
my
discourse
if
i
caught
at
a
word
now
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
doing
so
i
am
no
conceited
body
no
newspaper
neddy
no
pothouse
witty
person
i
was
about
to
say
madam
that
if
the
young
rye
asks
you
at
any
time
for
your
word
you
will
do
as
you
deem
convenient
but
i
am
sure
you
will
oblige
him
by
allowing
me
to
braid
your
hair
i
shall
not
do
it
to
oblige
him
said
belle
the
young
rye
as
you
call
him
is
nothing
to
me
well
then
to
oblige
me
said
petulengro
do
allow
me
to
become
your
poor
it
is
great
nonsense
said
belle
reddening
however
as
you
came
to
see
me
and
ask
the
matter
as
a
particular
favour
to
yourself
thank
you
madam
said
petulengro
leading
belle
to
the
stool
please
to
sit
down
here
thank
you
your
hair
is
very
beautiful
madam
she
continued
as
she
proceeded
to
braid
belle
hair
so
is
your
countenance
should
you
ever
go
to
the
great
city
among
the
grand
folks
you
would
make
a
sensation
madam
i
have
made
one
myself
who
am
dark
the
chi
she
is
kauley
which
last
word
signifies
black
which
i
am
not
though
rather
dark
there
is
no
colour
like
white
madam
it
so
lasting
so
genteel
gentility
will
carry
the
day
madam
even
with
the
young
rye
he
will
ask
words
of
the
black
lass
but
beg
the
word
of
the
fair
in
the
meantime
petulengro
and
myself
entered
into
conversation
any
news
stirring
mr
petulengro
said
i
have
you
heard
anything
of
the
great
religious
movements
plenty
said
petulengro
all
the
religious
people
more
especially
the
evangelicals
those
that
go
about
distributing
tracts
are
very
angry
about
the
fight
between
gentleman
cooper
and
bob
which
they
say
ought
not
to
have
been
permitted
to
take
place
and
then
they
are
trying
all
they
can
to
prevent
the
fight
between
the
lion
and
the
dogs
which
they
say
is
a
disgrace
to
a
christian
country
now
i
ca
say
that
i
have
any
quarrel
with
the
religious
party
and
the
evangelicals
they
are
always
civil
to
me
and
mine
and
frequently
give
us
tracts
as
they
call
them
which
neither
i
nor
mine
can
read
but
i
can
not
say
that
i
approve
of
any
movements
religious
or
not
which
have
in
aim
to
put
down
all
life
and
manly
sport
in
this
here
country
anything
else
said
i
people
are
becoming
vastly
sharp
said
petulengro
and
i
am
told
that
all
the
constables
are
going
to
be
set
aside
and
a
paid
body
of
men
to
be
established
who
are
not
to
permit
a
tramper
or
vagabond
on
the
roads
of
england
and
talking
of
roads
puts
me
in
mind
of
a
strange
story
i
heard
two
nights
ago
whilst
drinking
some
beer
at
a
in
company
with
my
cousin
sylvester
i
had
asked
tawno
to
go
but
his
wife
would
not
let
him
just
opposite
me
smoking
their
pipes
were
a
couple
of
men
something
like
engineers
and
they
were
talking
of
a
wonderful
invention
which
was
to
make
a
wonderful
alteration
in
england
inasmuch
as
it
would
set
aside
all
the
old
roads
which
in
a
little
time
would
be
ploughed
up
and
sowed
with
corn
and
cause
all
england
to
be
laid
down
with
iron
roads
on
which
people
would
go
thundering
along
in
vehicles
pushed
forward
by
fire
and
smoke
now
brother
when
i
heard
this
i
did
not
feel
very
comfortable
for
i
thought
to
myself
what
a
queer
place
such
a
road
would
be
to
pitch
tent
upon
and
how
impossible
it
would
be
for
one
cattle
to
find
a
bite
of
grass
upon
it
and
i
thought
likewise
of
the
danger
to
which
family
would
be
exposed
in
being
run
over
and
severely
scorched
by
these
same
flying
fiery
vehicles
so
i
made
bold
to
say
that
i
hoped
such
an
invention
would
never
be
countenanced
because
it
was
likely
to
do
a
great
deal
of
harm
whereupon
one
of
the
men
giving
me
a
glance
said
without
taking
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
that
for
his
part
he
sincerely
hoped
that
it
would
take
effect
and
if
it
did
no
other
good
than
stopping
the
rambles
of
gypsies
and
other
like
scamps
it
ought
to
be
encouraged
well
brother
feeling
myself
insulted
i
put
my
hand
into
my
pocket
in
order
to
pull
out
money
intending
to
challenge
him
to
fight
for
a
stake
but
merely
found
sixpence
having
left
all
my
other
money
at
the
tent
which
sixpence
was
just
sufficient
to
pay
for
the
beer
which
sylvester
and
myself
were
drinking
of
whom
i
hope
to
borrow
anything
as
sylvester
being
a
amongst
us
so
not
being
able
to
back
myself
i
held
my
peace
and
let
the
gorgio
have
it
all
his
own
way
who
after
turning
up
his
nose
at
me
went
on
discoursing
about
the
said
invention
saying
what
a
fund
of
profit
it
would
be
to
those
who
knew
how
to
make
use
of
it
and
should
have
the
laying
down
of
the
new
roads
and
the
shoeing
of
england
with
iron
and
after
he
had
said
this
and
much
more
of
the
same
kind
which
i
can
not
remember
he
and
his
companion
got
up
and
walked
away
and
presently
i
and
sylvester
got
up
and
walked
to
our
camp
and
there
i
lay
down
in
my
tent
by
the
side
of
my
wife
where
i
had
an
ugly
dream
of
having
camped
upon
an
iron
road
my
tent
being
overturned
by
a
flying
vehicle
my
wife
leg
injured
and
all
my
affairs
put
into
great
confusion
now
madam
said
petulengro
i
have
braided
your
hair
in
our
fashion
you
look
very
beautiful
madam
more
beautiful
if
possible
than
before
belle
now
rose
and
came
forward
with
her
petulengro
was
loud
in
his
applause
but
i
said
nothing
for
i
did
not
think
belle
was
improved
in
appearance
by
having
submitted
to
the
ministry
of
petulengro
hand
nature
never
intended
belle
to
appear
as
a
gypsy
she
had
made
her
too
proud
and
serious
a
more
proper
part
for
her
was
that
of
a
heroine
a
queenly
heroine
that
of
theresa
of
hungary
for
example
or
better
still
that
of
brynhilda
the
valkyrie
the
beloved
of
sigurd
the
who
incurred
the
curse
of
odin
because
in
the
tumult
of
spears
she
sided
with
the
young
king
and
doomed
the
old
warrior
to
die
to
whom
odin
had
promised
victory
belle
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
turning
to
petulengro
she
said
you
have
had
your
will
with
me
are
you
satisfied
quite
so
madam
said
petulengro
and
i
hope
you
will
be
so
too
as
soon
as
you
have
looked
in
the
glass
i
have
looked
in
one
already
said
belle
and
the
glass
does
not
flatter
you
mean
the
face
of
the
young
rye
said
petulengro
never
mind
him
madam
the
young
rye
though
he
knows
a
thing
or
two
is
not
a
university
nor
a
person
of
universal
wisdom
i
assure
you
that
you
never
looked
so
well
before
and
i
hope
that
from
this
moment
you
will
wear
your
hair
in
this
way
and
who
is
to
braid
it
in
this
way
said
belle
smiling
i
madam
said
petulengro
i
will
braid
it
for
you
every
morning
if
you
will
but
be
persuaded
to
join
us
do
so
madam
and
i
think
if
you
did
the
young
rye
would
do
so
too
the
young
rye
is
nothing
to
me
nor
i
to
him
said
belle
we
have
stayed
some
time
together
but
our
paths
will
soon
be
apart
now
farewell
for
i
am
about
to
take
a
journey
and
you
will
go
out
with
your
hair
as
i
have
braided
it
said
petulengro
if
you
do
everybody
will
be
in
love
with
you
no
said
belle
hitherto
i
have
allowed
you
to
do
what
you
please
but
henceforth
i
shall
have
my
own
way
come
come
said
she
observing
that
the
gypsy
was
about
to
speak
we
have
had
enough
of
nonsense
whenever
i
leave
this
hollow
it
will
be
wearing
my
hair
in
my
own
fashion
come
wife
said
petulengro
we
will
no
longer
intrude
upon
the
rye
and
rawnie
there
is
such
a
thing
as
being
troublesome
thereupon
petulengro
and
his
wife
took
their
leave
with
many
salutations
then
you
are
going
said
i
when
belle
and
i
were
left
alone
yes
said
belle
i
am
going
on
a
journey
my
affairs
compel
me
but
you
will
return
again
said
i
yes
said
belle
i
shall
return
once
more
once
more
said
i
what
do
you
mean
by
once
more
the
petulengros
will
soon
be
gone
and
will
you
abandon
me
in
this
place
you
were
alone
here
said
belle
before
i
came
and
i
suppose
found
it
agreeable
or
you
would
not
have
stayed
in
it
yes
said
i
that
was
before
i
knew

chapter

the
festival
the
gypsy
song
piramus
of
rome
the
scotchman
gypsy
names
on
the
following
day
there
was
much
feasting
amongst
the
romany
chals
of
petulengro
party
throughout
the
forenoon
the
romany
chies
did
scarcely
anything
but
cook
flesh
and
the
flesh
which
they
cooked
was
swine
flesh
about
two
the
chals
dividing
themselves
into
various
parties
sat
down
and
partook
of
the
fare
which
was
partly
roasted
partly
sodden
i
dined
that
day
with
petulengro
and
his
wife
and
family
ursula
and
chikno
and
sylvester
and
his
two
children
sylvester
it
will
be
as
well
to
say
was
a
widower
and
had
consequently
no
one
to
cook
his
victuals
for
him
supposing
he
had
any
which
was
not
always
the
case
sylvester
affairs
being
seldom
in
a
prosperous
state
he
was
noted
for
his
bad
success
in
trafficking
notwithstanding
the
many
hints
which
he
received
from
jasper
under
whose
protection
he
had
placed
himself
even
as
tawno
chikno
had
done
who
himself
as
the
reader
has
heard
on
a
former
occasion
was
anything
but
a
wealthy
subject
though
he
was
at
all
times
better
off
than
sylvester
the
lazarus
of
the
romany
tribe
all
our
party
ate
with
a
good
appetite
except
myself
who
feeling
rather
melancholy
that
day
had
little
desire
to
eat
i
did
not
like
the
others
partake
of
the
pork
but
got
my
dinner
entirely
off
the
body
of
a
squirrel
which
had
been
shot
the
day
before
by
a
chal
of
the
name
of
piramus
who
besides
being
a
good
shot
was
celebrated
for
his
skill
in
playing
on
the
fiddle
during
the
dinner
a
horn
filled
with
ale
passed
frequently
around
i
drank
of
it
more
than
once
and
felt
inspirited
by
the
draughts
the
repast
concluded
sylvester
and
his
children
departed
to
their
tent
and
petulengro
tawno
and
myself
getting
up
went
and
lay
down
under
a
shady
hedge
where
petulengro
lighting
his
pipe
began
to
smoke
and
where
tawno
presently
fell
asleep
i
was
about
to
fall
asleep
also
when
i
heard
the
sound
of
music
and
song
piramus
was
playing
on
the
fiddle
whilst
chikno
who
had
a
voice
of
her
own
was
singing
in
tones
sharp
enough
but
of
great
power
a
gypsy
song

we
go
to
the

of

where
we
buy
three
worth

and
when

we
say
we
will
poison
the

we
will
try
and
poison
the
porker
we
then
make
up
the
poison
and
then
we
take
our

of
the
farmer
as
if
to
beg
a
bit
of
victuals
a
little
broken
victuals
we
see
a
jolly
porker
and
then
we
say
in

language
fling
the
bane
yonder
amongst
the
dirt
and
the
porker
soon
will
find
it
the
porker
soon
will
find

early
on

we
will
return

beg
the

the
body
of
the
dead
porker
and
so
we
do
even
so
we
do
the
porker
dieth
during
the
night
on
the
morrow
we
beg
the
porker
and
carry
to
the

the
porker
and
then
we
wash
the
inside
well
till
all
the
inside
is
perfectly
clean
till
there
no
bane
within
it
not
a
poison
grain
within
it
and
then
we
roast
the
body
well
send
for

to

there
some
kernel
in
those
songs
brother
said
petulengro
when
the
songs
and
music
were
over
yes
said
i
they
are
certainly
very
remarkable
songs
i
say
jasper
i
hope
you
have
not
been
drabbing
baulor
lately
and
suppose
we
have
brother
what
then
why
it
is
a
very
dangerous
practice
to
say
nothing
of
the
wickedness
of
it
necessity
has
no
law
brother
that
is
true
said
i
i
have
always
said
so
but
you
are
not
necessitous
and
should
not
drab
baulor
and
who
told
you
we
had
been
drabbing
baulor
why
you
have
had
a
banquet
of
pork
and
after
the
banquet
chikno
sang
a
song
about
drabbing
baulor
so
i
naturally
thought
you
might
have
lately
been
engaged
in
such
a
thing
brother
you
occasionally
utter
a
word
or
two
of
common
sense
it
was
natural
for
you
to
suppose
after
seeing
that
dinner
of
pork
and
hearing
that
song
that
we
had
been
drabbing
baulor
i
will
now
tell
you
that
we
have
not
been
doing
so
what
have
you
to
say
to
that
that
i
am
very
glad
of
it
had
you
tasted
that
pork
brother
you
would
have
found
that
it
was
sweet
and
tasty
which
balluva
that
is
drabbed
can
hardly
be
expected
to
be
we
have
no
reason
to
drab
baulor
at
present
we
have
money
and
credit
but
necessity
has
no
law
our
forefathers
occasionally
drabbed
baulor
some
of
our
people
may
still
do
such
a
thing
but
only
from
compulsion
i
see
said
i
and
at
your
merry
meetings
you
sing
songs
upon
the
compulsatory
deeds
of
your
people
alias
their
villainous
actions
and
after
all
what
would
the
stirring
poetry
of
any
nation
be
but
for
its
compulsatory
deeds
look
at
the
poetry
of
scotland
the
heroic
part
founded
almost
entirely
on
the
villainous
deeds
of
the
scotch
nation
stealing
for
example
which
is
very
little
better
than
drabbing
baulor
whilst
the
softer
part
is
mostly
about
the
slips
of
its
females
among
the
broom
so
that
no
upholder
of
scotch
poetry
could
censure
ursula
song
as
indelicate
even
if
he
understood
it
what
do
you
think
jasper
i
think
brother
as
i
before
said
that
occasionally
you
utter
a
word
of
common
sense
you
were
talking
of
the
scotch
brother
what
do
you
think
of
a
scotchman
finding
fault
with
romany
a
scotchman
finding
fault
with
romany
jasper
oh
dear
but
you
joke
the
thing
could
never
be
yes
and
at
piramus
fiddle
what
do
you
think
of
a
scotchman
turning
up
his
nose
at
piramus
fiddle
a
scotchman
turning
up
his
nose
at
piramus
fiddle
nonsense
jasper
do
you
know
what
i
most
dislike
brother
i
do
not
unless
it
be
the
constable
jasper
it
is
not
the
constable
it
a
beggar
on
horseback
brother
what
do
you
mean
by
a
beggar
on
horseback
why
a
scamp
brother
raised
above
his
proper
place
who
takes
every
opportunity
of
giving
himself
fine
airs
about
a
week
ago
my
people
and
myself
camped
on
a
green
by
a
plantation
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
great
house
in
the
evening
we
were
making
merry
the
girls
were
dancing
while
piramus
was
playing
on
the
fiddle
a
tune
of
his
own
composing
to
which
he
has
given
his
own
name
piramus
of
rome
and
which
is
much
celebrated
amongst
our
people
and
from
which
i
have
been
told
that
one
of
the
grand
gorgio
composers
who
once
heard
it
has
taken
several
hints
so
as
we
were
making
merry
a
great
many
grand
people
lords
and
ladies
i
believe
came
from
the
great
house
and
looked
on
as
the
girls
danced
to
the
tune
of
piramus
of
rome
and
seemed
much
pleased
and
when
the
girls
had
left
off
dancing
and
piramus
playing
the
ladies
wanted
to
have
their
fortunes
told
so
i
bade
mikailia
chikno
who
can
tell
a
fortune
when
she
pleases
better
than
any
one
else
tell
them
a
fortune
and
she
being
in
a
good
mind
told
them
a
fortune
which
pleased
them
very
much
so
after
they
had
heard
their
fortunes
one
of
them
asked
if
any
of
our
women
could
sing
and
i
told
them
several
could
more
particularly
leviathan
you
know
leviathan
she
is
not
here
now
but
some
miles
distant
she
is
our
best
singer
ursula
coming
next
so
the
lady
said
she
should
like
to
hear
leviathan
sing
whereupon
leviathan
sang
the
gudlo
pesham
and
piramus
played
the
tune
of
the
same
name
which
as
you
know
means
the
honeycomb
the
song
and
the
tune
being
well
entitled
to
the
name
being
wonderfully
sweet
well
everybody
present
seemed
mighty
well
pleased
with
the
song
and
music
with
the
exception
of
one
person
a
scotch
body
how
he
came
there
i
do
know
but
there
he
was
and
coming
forward
he
began
in
scotch
as
broad
as
a
to
find
fault
with
the
music
and
the
song
saying
that
he
had
never
heard
viler
stuff
than
either
well
brother
out
of
consideration
for
the
civil
gentry
with
whom
the
fellow
had
come
i
held
my
peace
for
a
long
time
and
in
order
to
get
the
subject
changed
i
said
to
mikailia
in
romany
you
have
told
the
ladies
their
fortunes
now
tell
the
gentlemen
theirs
quick
quick
pen
lende
dukkerin
well
brother
the
scotchman
i
suppose
thinking
i
was
speaking
ill
of
him
fell
into
a
greater
passion
than
before
and
catching
hold
of
the
word
dukkerin
said
he
dukkerin
said
i
fortune
a
man
or
woman
destiny
do
you
like
the
word
d
ca
that
a
word
a
bonnie
word
said
he
you
tell
us
what
it
is
in
scotch
said
i
order
that
we
may
improve
our
language
by
a
scotch
word
a
pal
of
mine
has
told
me
that
we
have
taken
a
great
many
words
from
foreign
lingos
then
if
that
be
the
case
fellow
i
will
tell
you
it
is
spaeing
said
he
very
seriously
then
said
i
keep
my
own
word
which
is
much
the
prettiest
spaeing
spaeing
why
i
should
be
ashamed
to
make
use
of
the
word
it
sounds
so
much
like
a
certain
other
word
and
then
i
made
a
face
as
if
i
were
unwell
it
scotch
also
for
that
do
ye
mean
by
speaking
in
that
guise
to
a
gentleman
said
he
insolent
vagabond
without
a
name
or
a
country
you
are
mistaken
said
i
country
is
egypt
but
we
like
you
scotch
are
rather
fond
of
travelling
and
as
for
name
my
name
is
jasper
petulengro
perhaps
you
have
a
better
what
is
it
macraw
at
that
brother
the
gentlemen
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
and
all
the
ladies
tittered
you
were
rather
severe
on
the
scotchman
jasper
not
at
all
brother
and
suppose
i
were
he
began
first
i
am
the
civilest
man
in
the
world
and
never
interfere
with
anybody
who
lets
me
and
mine
alone
he
finds
fault
with
romany
forsooth
why
what
scotch
he
does
like
our
songs
what
are
his
own
i
understand
them
as
little
as
he
mine
i
have
heard
one
or
two
of
them
and
pretty
rubbish
they
seemed
but
the
best
of
the
joke
is
the
fellow
finding
fault
with
piramus
fiddle
a
chap
from
the
land
of
bagpipes
finding
fault
with
piramus
fiddle
why
i
back
that
fiddle
against
all
the
bagpipes
in
scotland
and
piramus
against
all
the
bagpipers
for
though
piramus
weighs
but
ten
stone
he
shall
flog
a
scotchman
of
twenty
scotchmen
are
never
so
fat
as
that
said
i
unless
indeed
they
have
been
a
long
time
pensioners
of
england
i
say
jasper
what
remarkable
names
your
people
have
and
what
pretty
names
brother
there
my
own
for
example
jasper
then
there
ambrose
and
sylvester
then
there
culvato
which
signifies
claude
then
there
piramus
that
a
nice
name
brother
then
there
your
wife
name
pakomovna
then
there
ursula
and
morella
then
brother
there
ercilla
ercilla
the
name
of
the
great
poet
of
spain
how
wonderful
then
leviathan
the
name
of
a
ship
brother
leviathan
was
named
after
a
ship
so
make
a
wonder
out
of
her
but
there
sanpriel
and
synfye
ay
and
clementina
and
lavinia
camillia
and
lydia
curlanda
and
orlanda
wherever
did
they
get
those
names
where
did
my
wife
get
her
necklace
brother
she
knows
best
jasper
i
hope
come
no
hoping
she
got
it
from
her
grandmother
who
died
at
the
age
of
a
hundred
and
three
and
sleeps
in
coggeshall
churchyard
she
got
it
from
her
mother
who
also
died
very
old
and
who
could
give
no
other
account
of
it
than
that
it
had
been
in
the
family
time
out
of
mind
whence
could
they
have
got
it
why
perhaps
where
they
got
their
names
brother
a
gentleman
who
had
travelled
much
once
told
me
that
he
had
seen
the
sister
of
it
about
the
neck
of
an
indian
queen
some
of
your
names
jasper
appear
to
be
church
names
your
own
for
example
and
ambrose
and
sylvester
perhaps
you
got
them
from
the
papists
in
the
times
of
popery
but
where
did
you
get
such
a
name
as
piramus
a
name
of
grecian
romance
then
some
of
them
appear
to
be
slavonian
for
example
mikailia
and
pakomovna
i
do
know
much
of
slavonian
but
what
is
slavonian
brother
the
family
name
of
certain
nations
the
principal
of
which
is
the
russian
and
from
which
the
word
slave
is
originally
derived
you
have
heard
of
the
russians
jasper
yes
brother
and
seen
some
i
saw
their
crallis
at
the
time
of
the
peace
he
was
not
a
man
for
a
russian
by
the
bye
jasper
i
half
inclined
to
think
that
crallis
is
a
slavish
word
i
saw
something
like
it
in
a
lil
called
life
of
charles
how
you
should
have
come
by
such
names
and
words
is
to
me
incomprehensible
you
seem
posed
brother
i
really
know
very
little
about
you
jasper
very
little
indeed
brother
we
know
very
little
about
ourselves
and
you
know
nothing
save
what
we
have
told
you
and
we
have
now
and
then
told
you
things
about
us
which
are
not
exactly
true
simply
to
make
a
fool
of
you
brother
you
will
say
that
was
wrong
perhaps
it
was
well
sunday
will
be
here
in
a
day
or
two
when
we
will
go
to
church
where
possibly
we
shall
hear
a
sermon
on
the
disastrous
consequences
of
lying
chapter
viii
the
church
the
aristocratical
pew
days
of
yore
the
clergyman
in
what
would
a
man
be
profited
when
two
days
had
passed
sunday
came
i
breakfasted
by
myself
in
the
solitary
dingle
and
then
having
set
things
a
little
to
rights
i
ascended
to
petulengro
encampment
i
could
hear
ringing
around
in
the
distance
appearing
to
say
come
to
church
come
to
church
as
clearly
as
it
was
possible
for
to
say
i
found
petulengro
seated
by
the
door
of
his
tent
smoking
his
pipe
in
rather
an
ungenteel
undress
well
jasper
said
i
are
you
ready
to
go
to
church
for
if
you
are
i
am
ready
to
accompany
you
i
am
not
ready
brother
said
petulengro
nor
is
my
wife
the
church
too
to
which
we
shall
go
is
three
miles
off
so
it
is
of
no
use
to
think
of
going
there
this
morning
as
the
service
would
be
over
before
we
got
there
if
however
you
are
disposed
to
go
in
the
afternoon
we
are
your
people
thereupon
i
returned
to
my
dingle
where
i
passed
several
hours
in
conning
the
welsh
bible
which
the
preacher
peter
williams
had
given
me
at
last
i
gave
over
reading
took
a
slight
refreshment
and
was
about
to
emerge
from
the
dingle
when
i
heard
the
voice
of
petulengro
calling
me
i
went
up
again
to
the
encampment
where
i
found
petulengro
his
wife
and
tawno
chikno
ready
to
proceed
to
church
and
petulengro
were
dressed
in
roman
fashion
though
not
in
the
manner
in
which
they
had
paid
their
visit
to
isopel
and
myself
tawno
had
on
a
clean
white
slop
with
a
nearly
new
black
beaver
with
very
broad
rims
and
the
nap
exceedingly
long
as
for
myself
i
was
dressed
in
much
the
same
manner
as
that
in
which
i
departed
from
london
having
on
in
honour
of
the
day
a
shirt
perfectly
clean
having
washed
one
on
purpose
for
the
occasion
with
my
own
hands
the
day
before
in
the
pond
of
tepid
water
in
which
the
newts
and
defts
were
in
the
habit
of
taking
their
pleasure
we
proceeded
for
upwards
of
a
mile
by
footpaths
through
meadows
and
we
crossed
various
stiles
at
last
passing
over
one
we
found
ourselves
in
a
road
wending
along
which
for
a
considerable
distance
we
at
last
came
in
sight
of
a
church
the
bells
of
which
had
been
tolling
distinctly
in
our
ears
for
some
time
before
however
we
reached
the
the
bells
had
ceased
their
melody
it
was
surrounded
by
lofty
of
brilliant
green
foliage
we
entered
the
gate
petulengro
leading
the
way
and
proceeded
to
a
small
door
near
the
east
end
of
the
church
as
we
advanced
the
sound
of
singing
within
the
church
rose
upon
our
ears
arrived
at
the
small
door
petulengro
opened
it
and
entered
followed
by
tawno
chikno
i
myself
went
last
of
all
following
petulengro
who
before
i
entered
turned
round
and
with
a
significant
nod
advised
me
to
take
care
how
i
behaved
the
part
of
the
church
which
we
had
entered
was
the
chancel
on
one
side
stood
a
number
of
venerable
old
men
probably
the
neighbouring
poor
and
on
the
other
a
number
of
poor
girls
belonging
to
the
village
school
dressed
in
white
gowns
and
straw
bonnets
whom
two
elegant
but
simply
dressed
young
women
were
superintending
every
voice
seemed
to
be
united
in
singing
a
certain
anthem
which
notwithstanding
it
was
written
neither
by
tate
nor
brady
contains
some
of
the
sublimest
words
which
were
ever
put
together
not
the
worst
of
which
are
those
which
burst
on
our
ears
as
we
entered
every
eye
shall
now
behold
him
robed
in
dreadful
majesty
those
who
set
at
nought
and
sold
him
pierced
and
nailed
him
to
the
tree
deeply
wailing
shall
the
true
messiah
see
still
following
petulengro
we
proceeded
down
the
chancel
and
along
the
aisle
notwithstanding
the
singing
i
could
distinctly
hear
as
we
passed
many
a
voice
whispering
here
come
the
gypsies
here
come
the
gypsies
i
felt
rather
embarrassed
with
a
somewhat
awkward
doubt
as
to
where
we
were
to
sit
none
of
the
occupiers
of
the
pews
who
appeared
to
consist
almost
entirely
of
farmers
with
their
wives
sons
and
daughters
opened
a
door
to
admit
us
petulengro
however
appeared
to
feel
not
the
least
embarrassment
but
tripped
along
the
aisle
with
the
greatest
nonchalance
we
passed
under
the
pulpit
in
which
stood
the
clergyman
in
his
white
surplice
and
reached
the
middle
of
the
church
where
we
were
confronted
by
the
sexton
dressed
in
long
blue
coat
and
holding
in
his
hand
a
wand
this
functionary
motioned
towards
the
lower
end
of
the
church
where
were
certain
benches
partly
occupied
by
poor
people
and
boys
petulengro
however
with
a
toss
of
her
head
directed
her
course
to
a
magnificent
pew
which
was
unoccupied
which
she
opened
and
entered
followed
closely
by
tawno
chikno
petulengro
and
myself
the
sexton
did
not
appear
by
any
means
to
approve
of
the
arrangement
and
as
i
stood
next
the
door
laid
his
finger
on
my
arm
as
if
to
intimate
that
myself
and
companions
must
quit
our
aristocratical
location
i
said
nothing
but
directed
my
eyes
to
the
clergyman
who
uttered
a
short
and
expressive
cough
the
sexton
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
bowing
his
head
closed
the
door
in
a
moment
more
the
music
ceased
i
took
up
a
on
which
was
engraved
an
coronet
the
clergyman
uttered
i
will
arise
and
go
to
my
father
england
sublime
liturgy
had
commenced
oh
what
feelings
came
over
me
on
finding
myself
again
in
an
edifice
devoted
to
the
religion
of
my
country
i
had
not
been
in
such
a
place
i
can
not
tell
for
how
long
certainly
not
for
years
and
now
i
had
found
my
way
there
again
it
appeared
as
if
i
had
fallen
asleep
in
the
pew
of
the
old
church
of
pretty
d
i
had
occasionally
done
so
when
a
child
and
had
suddenly
woke
up
yes
surely
i
had
been
asleep
and
had
woke
up
but
no
alas
no
i
had
not
been
asleep
at
least
not
in
the
old
church
if
i
had
been
asleep
i
had
been
walking
in
my
sleep
struggling
striving
learning
and
unlearning
in
my
sleep
years
had
rolled
away
whilst
i
had
been
asleep
ripe
fruit
had
fallen
green
fruit
had
come
on
whilst
i
had
been
asleep
how
circumstances
had
altered
and
above
all
myself
whilst
i
had
been
asleep
no
i
had
not
been
asleep
in
the
old
church
i
was
in
a
pew
it
is
true
but
not
the
pew
of
black
leather
in
which
i
sometimes
fell
asleep
in
days
of
yore
but
in
a
strange
pew
and
then
my
companions
they
were
no
longer
those
of
days
of
yore
i
was
no
longer
with
my
respectable
father
and
mother
and
my
dear
brother
but
with
the
gypsy
cral
and
his
wife
and
the
gigantic
tawno
the
antinous
of
the
dusky
people
and
what
was
i
myself
no
longer
an
innocent
child
but
a
moody
man
bearing
in
my
face
as
i
knew
well
the
marks
of
my
strivings
and
strugglings
of
what
i
had
learnt
and
unlearnt
nevertheless
the
general
aspect
of
things
brought
to
my
mind
what
i
had
felt
and
seen
of
yore
there
was
difference
enough
it
is
true
but
still
there
was
a
similarity
at
least
i
thought
so
the
church
the
clergyman
and
the
clerk
differing
in
many
respects
from
those
of
pretty
d
put
me
strangely
in
mind
of
them
and
then
the
words
by
the
bye
was
it
not
the
magic
of
the
words
which
brought
the
dear
enchanting
past
so
powerfully
before
the
mind
of
lavengro
for
the
words
were
the
same
sonorous
words
of
high
import
which
had
first
made
an
impression
on
his
childish
ear
in
the
old
church
of
pretty
d
the
liturgy
was
now
over
during
the
reading
of
which
my
companions
behaved
in
a
most
unexceptionable
manner
sitting
down
and
rising
up
when
other
people
sat
down
and
rose
and
holding
in
their
hands
which
they
found
in
the
pew
into
which
they
stared
intently
though
i
observed
that
with
the
exception
of
petulengro
who
knew
how
to
read
a
little
they
held
the
books
by
the
top
and
not
the
bottom
as
is
the
usual
way
the
clergyman
now
ascended
the
pulpit
arrayed
in
his
black
gown
the
congregation
composed
themselves
to
attention
as
did
also
my
companions
who
fixed
their
eyes
upon
the
clergyman
with
a
certain
strange
immovable
stare
which
i
believe
to
be
peculiar
to
their
race
the
clergyman
gave
out
his
text
and
began
to
preach
he
was
a
tall
gentlemanly
man
seemingly
between
fifty
and
sixty
with
greyish
hair
his
features
were
very
handsome
but
with
a
somewhat
melancholy
cast
the
tones
of
his
voice
were
rich
and
noble
but
also
with
somewhat
of
melancholy
in
them
the
text
which
he
gave
out
was
the
following
one
in
what
would
a
man
be
profited
provided
he
gained
the
whole
world
and
lost
his
own
soul
and
on
this
text
the
clergyman
preached
long
and
well
he
did
not
read
his
sermon
but
spoke
it
extempore
his
doing
so
rather
surprised
and
offended
me
at
first
i
was
not
used
to
such
a
style
of
preaching
in
a
church
devoted
to
the
religion
of
my
country
i
compared
it
within
my
mind
with
the
style
of
preaching
used
by
the
rector
in
the
old
church
of
pretty
d
and
i
thought
to
myself
it
was
very
different
and
being
very
different
i
did
not
like
it
and
i
thought
to
myself
how
scandalized
the
people
of
d
would
have
been
had
they
heard
it
and
i
figured
to
myself
how
indignant
the
clerk
would
have
been
had
any
clergyman
got
up
in
the
church
of
d
and
preached
in
such
a
manner
did
it
not
savour
strongly
of
dissent
methodism
and
similar
low
stuff
surely
it
did
why
the
methodist
i
had
heard
preach
on
the
heath
above
the
old
city
preached
in
the
same
manner
at
least
he
preached
extempore
ay
and
something
like
the
present
clergyman
for
the
methodist
spoke
very
zealously
and
with
great
feeling
and
so
did
the
present
clergyman
so
i
of
course
felt
rather
offended
with
the
clergyman
for
speaking
with
zeal
and
feeling
however
long
before
the
sermon
was
over
i
forgot
the
offence
which
i
had
taken
and
listened
to
the
sermon
with
much
admiration
for
the
eloquence
and
powerful
reasoning
with
which
it
abounded
oh
how
eloquent
he
was
when
he
talked
of
the
inestimable
value
of
a
man
soul
which
he
said
endured
for
ever
whilst
his
body
as
every
one
knew
lasted
at
most
for
a
very
contemptible
period
of
time
and
how
forcibly
he
reasoned
on
the
folly
of
a
man
who
for
the
sake
of
gaining
the
whole
world
a
thing
he
said
which
provided
he
gained
he
could
only
possess
for
a
part
of
the
time
during
which
his
perishable
body
existed
should
lose
his
soul
that
is
cause
that
precious
deathless
portion
of
him
to
suffer
indescribable
misery
time
without
end
there
was
one
part
of
his
sermon
which
struck
me
in
a
very
particular
manner
he
said
that
there
were
some
people
who
gained
something
in
return
for
their
souls
if
they
did
not
get
the
whole
world
they
got
a
part
of
it
lands
wealth
honour
or
renown
mere
trifles
he
allowed
in
comparison
with
the
value
of
a
man
soul
which
is
destined
either
to
enjoy
delight
or
suffer
tribulation
time
without
end
but
which
in
the
eyes
of
the
worldly
had
a
certain
value
and
which
afforded
a
certain
pleasure
and
satisfaction
but
there
were
also
others
who
lost
their
souls
and
got
nothing
for
them
neither
lands
wealth
renown
nor
consideration
who
were
poor
outcasts
and
despised
by
everybody
my
friends
he
added
if
the
man
is
a
fool
who
barters
his
soul
for
the
whole
world
what
a
fool
he
must
be
who
barters
his
soul
for
nothing
the
eyes
of
the
clergyman
as
he
uttered
these
words
wandered
around
the
whole
congregation
and
when
he
had
concluded
them
the
eyes
of
the
whole
congregation
were
turned
upon
my
companions
and
myself
chapter

the

over
my
companions
and
myself
returned
towards
the
encampment
by
the
way
we
came
some
of
the
humble
part
of
the
congregation
laughed
and
joked
at
us
as
we
passed
petulengro
and
his
wife
however
returned
their
laughs
and
jokes
with
interest
as
for
tawno
and
myself
we
said
nothing
tawno
like
most
handsome
fellows
having
very
little
to
say
for
himself
at
any
time
and
myself
though
not
handsome
not
being
particularly
skilful
at
repartee
some
boys
followed
us
for
a
considerable
time
making
all
kinds
of
observations
about
gypsies
but
as
we
walked
at
a
great
pace
we
gradually
left
them
behind
and
at
last
lost
sight
of
them
petulengro
and
tawno
chikno
walked
together
even
as
they
had
come
whilst
petulengro
and
myself
followed
at
a
little
distance
that
was
a
very
fine
preacher
we
heard
said
i
to
petulengro
after
we
had
crossed
the
stile
into
the
fields
very
fine
indeed
brother
said
petulengro
he
is
talked
of
far
and
wide
for
his
sermons
folks
say
that
there
is
scarcely
another
like
him
in
the
whole
of
england
he
looks
rather
melancholy
jasper
he
lost
his
wife
several
years
ago
who
they
say
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
women
ever
seen
they
say
that
it
was
grief
for
her
loss
that
made
him
come
out
mighty
strong
as
a
preacher
for
though
he
was
a
clergyman
he
was
never
heard
of
in
the
pulpit
before
he
lost
his
wife
since
then
the
whole
country
has
rung
with
the
preaching
of
the
clergyman
of
m
as
they
call
him
those
two
nice
young
gentlewomen
whom
you
saw
with
the
female
childer
are
his
daughters
you
seem
to
know
all
about
him
jasper
did
you
ever
hear
him
preach
before
never
brother
but
he
has
frequently
been
to
our
tent
and
his
daughters
too
and
given
us
tracts
for
he
is
one
of
the
people
they
call
evangelicals
who
give
folks
tracts
which
they
can
not
read
you
should
learn
to
read
jasper
we
have
no
time
brother
are
you
not
frequently
idle
never
brother
when
we
are
not
engaged
in
our
traffic
we
are
engaged
in
taking
our
relaxation
so
we
have
no
time
to
learn
you
really
should
make
an
effort
if
you
were
disposed
to
learn
to
read
i
would
endeavour
to
assist
you
you
would
be
all
the
better
for
knowing
how
to
read
in
what
way
brother
why
you
could
read
the
scriptures
and
by
so
doing
learn
your
duty
towards
your
we
know
that
already
brother
the
constables
and
justices
have
contrived
to
knock
that
tolerably
into
our
heads
yet
you
frequently
break
the
laws
so
i
believe
do
now
and
then
those
who
know
how
to
read
brother
very
true
jasper
but
you
really
ought
to
learn
to
read
as
by
so
doing
you
might
learn
your
duty
towards
yourselves
and
your
chief
duty
is
to
take
care
of
your
own
souls
did
not
the
preacher
say
what
is
a
man
profited
provided
he
gain
the
whole
world
we
have
not
much
of
the
world
brother
very
little
indeed
jasper
did
you
not
observe
how
the
eyes
of
the
whole
congregation
were
turned
towards
our
pew
when
the
preacher
said
are
some
people
who
lose
their
souls
and
get
nothing
in
exchange
who
are
outcast
despised
and
miserable
now
was
not
what
he
said
quite
applicable
to
the
gypsies
we
are
not
miserable
brother
well
then
you
ought
to
be
jasper
have
you
an
inch
of
ground
of
your
own
are
you
of
the
least
use
are
you
not
spoken
ill
of
by
everybody
what
a
gypsy
what
the
bird
noising
yonder
brother
the
bird
oh
that
the
cuckoo
tolling
but
what
has
the
cuckoo
to
do
with
the
matter
we
see
brother
what
the
cuckoo
what
is
it
you
know
as
much
about
it
as
myself
jasper
is
it
a
kind
of
roguish
chaffing
bird
brother
i
believe
it
is
jasper
nobody
knows
whence
it
comes
brother
i
believe
not
jasper
very
poor
brother
not
a
nest
of
its
own
so
they
say
jasper
with
every
person
bad
word
brother
yes
jasper
every
person
is
mocking
it
tolerably
merry
brother
yes
tolerably
merry
jasper
of
no
use
at
all
brother
none
whatever
jasper
you
would
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
the
cuckoos
brother
why
not
exactly
jasper
the
cuckoo
is
a
pleasant
funny
bird
and
its
presence
and
voice
give
a
great
charm
to
the
green
trees
and
fields
no
i
ca
say
i
wish
exactly
to
get
rid
of
the
cuckoo
well
brother
what
a
romany
chal
you
must
answer
that
question
yourself
jasper
a
roguish
chaffing
fellow
he
brother
ay
ay
jasper
of
no
use
at
all
brother
just
so
jasper
i
see
something
very
much
like
a
cuckoo
brother
i
see
what
you
are
after
jasper
you
would
like
to
get
rid
of
us
would
you
why
no
not
exactly
we
are
no
ornament
to
the
green
lanes
in
spring
and
summer
time
are
we
brother
and
the
voices
of
our
chies
with
their
cukkerin
and
dukkerin
do
help
to
make
them
pleasant
i
see
what
you
are
at
jasper
you
would
wish
to
turn
the
cuckoos
into
fowls
would
you
ca
say
i
should
jasper
whatever
some
people
might
wish
and
the
chals
and
chies
into
radical
weavers
and
factory
wenches
hey
brother
ca
say
that
i
should
jasper
you
are
certainly
a
picturesque
people
and
in
many
respects
an
ornament
both
to
town
and
country
painting
and
lil
writing
too
are
under
great
obligations
to
you
what
pretty
pictures
are
made
out
of
your
campings
and
groupings
and
what
pretty
books
have
been
written
in
which
gypsies
or
at
least
creatures
intended
to
represent
gypsies
have
been
the
principal
figures
i
think
if
we
were
without
you
we
should
begin
to
miss
you
just
as
you
would
the
cuckoos
if
they
were
all
converted
into
fowls
i
tell
you
what
brother
frequently
as
i
have
sat
under
a
hedge
in
spring
or
summer
time
and
heard
the
cuckoo
i
have
thought
that
we
chals
and
cuckoos
are
alike
in
many
respects
but
especially
in
character
everybody
speaks
ill
of
us
both
and
everybody
is
glad
to
see
both
of
us
again
yes
jasper
but
there
is
some
difference
between
men
and
cuckoos
men
have
souls
jasper
and
why
not
cuckoos
brother
you
should
not
talk
so
jasper
what
you
say
is
little
short
of
blasphemy
how
should
a
bird
have
a
soul
and
how
should
a
man
oh
we
know
very
well
that
a
man
has
a
soul
how
do
you
know
it
we
know
very
well
would
you
take
your
oath
of
it
brother
your
bodily
oath
why
i
think
i
might
jasper
did
you
ever
see
the
soul
brother
no
i
never
saw
it
then
how
could
you
swear
to
it
a
pretty
figure
you
would
make
in
a
court
of
justice
to
swear
to
a
thing
which
you
never
saw
hold
up
your
head
fellow
when
and
where
did
you
see
it
now
upon
your
oath
fellow
do
you
mean
to
say
that
this
roman
stole
the
donkey
foal
oh
there
no
one
for
like
counsellor
p
our
people
when
they
are
in
a
hobble
always
like
to
employ
him
though
he
is
somewhat
dear
now
brother
how
can
you
get
over
the
your
oath
fellow
will
you
say
that
you
have
a
soul
well
we
will
take
no
oaths
on
the
subject
but
you
yourself
believe
in
the
soul
i
have
heard
you
say
that
you
believe
in
dukkerin
now
what
is
dukkerin
but
the
soul
science
when
did
i
say
that
i
believed
in
it
why
after
that
fight
when
you
pointed
to
the
bloody
mark
in
the
cloud
whilst
he
you
wot
of
was
galloping
in
the
barouche
to
the
old
town
amidst
the
the
thunder
and
flame
of
heaven
i
have
some
kind
of
remembrance
of
it
brother
then
again
i
heard
you
say
that
the
dook
of
abershaw
rode
every
night
on
horseback
down
the
wooded
hill
i
say
brother
what
a
wonderful
memory
you
have
i
wish
i
had
not
jasper
but
i
ca
help
it
it
is
my
misfortune
misfortune
well
perhaps
it
is
at
any
rate
it
is
very
ungenteel
to
have
such
a
memory
i
have
heard
my
wife
say
that
to
show
you
have
a
long
memory
looks
very
vulgar
and
that
you
ca
give
a
greater
proof
of
gentility
than
by
forgetting
a
thing
as
soon
as
possible
more
especially
a
promise
or
an
acquaintance
when
he
happens
to
be
shabby
well
brother
i
do
deny
that
i
may
have
said
that
i
believe
in
dukkerin
and
in
abershaw
dook
which
you
say
is
his
soul
but
what
i
believe
one
moment
or
say
i
believe
do
be
certain
that
i
shall
believe
the
next
or
say
i
do
indeed
jasper
i
heard
you
say
on
a
previous
occasion
on
quoting
a
piece
of
a
song
that
when
a
man
dies
he
is
cast
into
the
earth
and
there
an
end
of
him
i
did
did
i
lor
what
a
memory
you
have
brother
but
you
are
not
sure
that
i
hold
that
opinion
now
certainly
not
jasper
indeed
after
such
a
sermon
as
we
have
been
hearing
i
should
be
very
shocked
if
you
held
such
an
opinion
however
brother
do
be
sure
i
do
not
however
shocking
such
an
opinion
may
be
to
you
what
an
incomprehensible
people
you
are
jasper
we
are
rather
so
brother
indeed
we
have
posed
wiser
heads
than
yours
before
now
you
seem
to
care
for
so
little
and
yet
you
rove
about
a
distinct
race
i
say
brother
yes
jasper
what
do
you
think
of
our
women
they
have
certainly
very
singular
names
jasper
names
lavengro
however
brother
if
you
had
been
as
fond
of
things
as
of
names
you
would
never
have
been
a
pal
of
ours
what
do
you
mean
jasper
they
rum
animals
they
have
tongues
of
their
own
jasper
did
you
ever
feel
their
teeth
and
nails
brother
never
jasper
save
herne
i
have
always
been
very
civil
to
them
so
they
let
you
alone
i
say
brother
some
part
of
the
secret
is
in
them
they
seem
rather
flighty
jasper
ay
ay
brother
rather
fond
of
loose
discourse
rather
so
brother
can
you
always
trust
them
jasper
we
never
watch
them
brother
can
they
always
trust
you
not
quite
so
well
as
we
can
them
however
we
get
on
very
well
together
except
mikailia
and
her
husband
but
mikailia
is
a
cripple
and
is
married
to
the
beauty
of
the
world
so
she
may
be
expected
to
be
jealous
though
he
would
not
part
with
her
for
a
duchess
no
more
than
i
would
part
with
my
rawnie
nor
any
other
chal
with
his
ay
but
would
not
the
chi
part
with
the
chal
for
a
duke
jasper
my
pakomovna
gave
up
the
duke
for
me
brother
but
she
occasionally
talks
of
him
jasper
yes
brother
but
pakomovna
was
born
on
a
common
not
far
from
the
sign
of
the
gammon
gammon
of
bacon
i
suppose
yes
brother
but
gammon
likewise
means
i
know
it
does
jasper
it
means
fun
ridicule
jest
it
is
an
ancient
norse
word
and
is
found
in
the
edda
lor
brother
how
learned
in
lils
you
are
many
words
of
norse
are
to
be
found
in
our
vulgar
sayings
jasper
for
example
in
that
particularly
vulgar
saying
of
ours
mother
is
up
there
a
noble
norse
word
mother
there
meaning
not
the
female
who
bore
us
but
rage
and
choler
as
i
discovered
by
reading
the
sagas
jasper
lor
brother
how
you
be
indifferently
so
jasper
then
you
think
you
might
trust
your
wife
with
the
duke
i
think
i
could
brother
or
even
with
yourself
myself
jasper
oh
i
never
troubled
my
head
about
your
wife
but
i
suppose
there
have
been
love
affairs
between
gorgios
and
romany
chies
why
novels
are
stuffed
with
such
matters
and
then
even
one
of
your
own
songs
says
so
the
song
which
ursula
was
singing
the
other
afternoon
that
is
somewhat
of
an
old
song
brother
and
is
sung
by
the
chies
as
a
warning
at
our
solemn
festivals
well
but
there
your
ursula
herself
jasper
ursula
herself
brother
you
were
talking
of
my
having
her
jasper
well
brother
why
did
you
have
her
would
she
have
had
me
of
course
brother
you
are
so
much
of
a
roman
and
speak
romany
so
remarkably
well
poor
thing
she
looks
very
innocent
remarkably
so
brother
however
though
not
born
on
the
same
common
with
my
wife
she
knows
a
thing
or
two
of
roman
matters
i
should
like
to
ask
her
a
question
or
two
jasper
in
connection
with
that
song
you
can
do
no
better
brother
here
we
are
at
the
camp
after
tea
take
ursula
under
a
hedge
and
ask
her
a
question
or
two
in
connection
with
that
song
chapter
x
sunday
evening
ursula
action
at
law
meridiana
married
already
i
took
tea
that
evening
with
and
petulengro
and
ursula
outside
of
their
tent
tawno
was
not
present
being
engaged
with
his
wife
in
his
own
tabernacle
sylvester
was
there
however
lolling
listlessly
upon
the
ground
as
i
looked
upon
this
man
i
thought
him
one
of
the
most
disagreeable
fellows
i
had
ever
seen
his
features
were
ugly
and
moreover
as
dark
as
pepper
and
besides
being
dark
his
skin
was
dirty
as
for
his
dress
it
was
torn
and
sordid
his
chest
was
broad
and
his
arms
seemed
powerful
but
upon
the
whole
he
looked
a
very
caitiff
i
am
sorry
that
man
has
lost
his
wife
thought
i
for
i
am
sure
he
will
never
get
another
what
surprises
me
is
that
he
ever
found
a
woman
disposed
to
unite
her
lot
with
his
after
tea
i
got
up
and
strolled
about
the
field
my
thoughts
were
upon
isopel
berners
i
wondered
where
she
was
and
how
long
she
would
stay
away
at
length
becoming
tired
and
listless
i
determined
to
return
to
the
dingle
and
resume
the
reading
of
the
bible
at
the
place
where
i
had
left
off
what
better
could
i
do
methought
on
a
sunday
evening
i
was
then
near
the
wood
which
surrounded
the
dingle
but
at
that
side
which
was
farthest
from
the
encampment
which
stood
near
the
entrance
suddenly
on
turning
round
the
southern
corner
of
the
copse
which
surrounded
the
dingle
i
perceived
ursula
seated
under
a
thornbush
i
thought
i
never
saw
her
look
prettier
than
then
dressed
as
she
was
in
her
sunday
best
good
evening
ursula
said
i
i
little
thought
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
here
nor
would
you
brother
said
ursula
had
not
jasper
told
me
that
you
had
been
talking
about
me
and
wanted
to
speak
to
me
under
a
hedge
so
hearing
that
i
watched
your
motions
and
came
here
and
sat
down
i
was
thinking
of
going
to
my
quarters
in
the
dingle
to
read
the
bible
ursula
but
oh
pray
then
go
to
your
quarters
brother
and
read
the
miduveleskoe
lil
you
can
speak
to
me
under
a
hedge
some
other
time
i
think
i
will
sit
down
with
you
ursula
for
after
all
reading
godly
books
in
dingles
at
eve
is
rather
sombre
work
yes
i
think
i
will
sit
down
with
you
and
i
sat
down
by
her
side
well
brother
now
you
have
sat
down
with
me
under
the
hedge
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
why
i
hardly
know
ursula
not
know
brother
a
pretty
fellow
you
to
ask
young
women
to
come
and
sit
with
you
under
hedges
and
when
they
come
not
know
what
to
say
to
them
oh
ah
i
remember
do
you
know
ursula
that
i
take
a
great
interest
in
you
thank
ye
brother
kind
of
you
at
any
rate
you
must
be
exposed
to
a
great
many
temptations
ursula
a
great
many
indeed
brother
it
is
hard
to
see
fine
things
such
as
shawls
gold
watches
and
chains
in
the
shops
behind
the
big
glasses
and
to
know
that
they
are
not
intended
for
one
many
the
time
i
have
been
tempted
to
make
a
dash
at
them
but
i
bethought
myself
that
by
so
doing
i
should
cut
my
hands
besides
being
almost
certain
of
being
grabbed
and
sent
across
the
gull
bath
to
the
foreign
country
then
you
think
gold
and
fine
things
temptations
ursula
of
course
brother
very
great
temptations
do
you
think
them
so
ca
say
i
do
ursula
then
more
fool
you
brother
but
have
the
kindness
to
tell
me
what
you
would
call
a
temptation
why
for
example
the
hope
of
honour
and
renown
ursula
the
hope
of
honour
and
renown
very
good
brother
but
i
tell
you
one
thing
that
unless
you
have
money
in
your
pocket
and
good
on
your
back
you
are
not
likely
to
obtain
much
honour
and
what
do
you
call
it
amongst
the
gorgios
to
say
nothing
of
the
romany
chals
i
should
have
thought
ursula
that
the
romany
chals
roaming
about
the
world
as
they
do
free
and
independent
were
above
being
led
by
such
trifles
then
you
know
nothing
of
the
gypsies
brother
no
people
on
earth
are
fonder
of
those
trifles
as
you
call
them
than
the
romany
chals
and
more
disposed
to
respect
those
who
have
them
then
money
and
fine
clothes
would
induce
you
to
do
anything

fact

i
said
before
gold
and
fine
clothes
are
great
temptations
well
ursula
i
am
sorry
for
it
i
should
never
have
thought
you
so
depraved
indeed
brother
to
think
that
i
am
seated
by
one
who
is
willing
to
to
go
on
brother
to
play
the
thief
go
on
brother
the
liar

on
brother

the

what

starting
from
her
seat
why
the
lubbeny
do
you
i
tell
you
what
brother
said
ursula
looking
somewhat
pale
and
speaking
very
low
if
i
had
only
something
in
my
hand
i
would
do
you
a
mischief
why
what
is
the
matter
ursula
said
i
how
have
i
offended
you
how
have
you
offended
me
why
did
you
insinivate
just
now
that
i
was
ready
to
play
the
the
go
on
ursula
the
the
i
not
say
it
but
i
only
wish
i
had
something
in
my
hand
if
i
have
offended
ursula
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
any
offence
i
may
have
given
you
was
from
want
of
understanding
you
come
pray
be
seated
i
have
much
to
question
you
about
to
talk
to
you
about
seated
not
i
it
was
only
just
now
that
you
gave
me
to
understand
that
you
was
ashamed
to
be
seated
by
me
a
thief
a
liar
well
did
you
not
almost
give
me
to
understand
that
you
were
both
ursula
i
do
much
care
being
called
a
thief
and
a
liar
said
ursula
a
person
may
be
a
liar
and
thief
and
yet
a
very
honest
woman
but
well
ursula
i
tell
you
what
brother
if
you
ever
sinivate
again
that
i
could
be
the
third
thing
so
help
me
duvel
i
do
you
a
mischief
by
my
god
i
will
well
ursula
i
assure
you
that
i
shall
sinivate
as
you
call
it
nothing
of
the
kind
about
you
i
have
no
doubt
from
what
you
have
said
that
you
are
a
very
paragon
of
virtue
a
perfect
lucretia
but
my
name
is
ursula
brother
and
not
lucretia
lucretia
is
not
of
our
family
but
one
of
the
bucklands
she
travels
about
oxfordshire
yet
i
am
as
good
as
she
any
day
lucretia
how
odd
where
could
she
have
got
that
name
well
i
make
no
doubt
ursula
that
you
are
quite
as
good
as
she
and
she
as
her
namesake
of
ancient
rome
but
there
is
a
mystery
in
this
same
virtue
ursula
which
i
can
not
fathom
how
a
thief
and
a
liar
should
be
able
or
indeed
willing
to
preserve
her
virtue
is
what
i
do
understand
you
confess
that
you
are
very
fond
of
gold
now
how
is
it
that
you
do
barter
your
virtue
for
gold
sometimes
i
am
a
philosopher
ursula
and
like
to
know
everything
you
must
be
every
now
and
then
exposed
to
great
temptation
ursula
for
you
are
of
a
beauty
calculated
to
captivate
all
hearts
come
sit
down
and
tell
me
how
you
are
enabled
to
resist
such
a
temptation
as
gold
and
fine
clothes
well
brother
said
ursula
as
you
say
you
mean
no
harm
i
will
sit
down
beside
you
and
enter
into
discourse
with
you
but
i
will
uphold
that
you
are
the
coolest
hand
that
i
ever
came
nigh
and
say
the
coolest
things
and
thereupon
ursula
sat
down
by
my
side
well
ursula
we
will
if
you
please
discourse
on
the
subject
of
your
temptations
i
suppose
that
you
travel
very
much
about
and
show
yourself
in
all
kinds
of
places
in
all
kinds
brother
i
travels
as
you
say
very
much
about
attends
fairs
and
races
and
enters
booths
and
where
i
tells
fortunes
and
sometimes
dances
and
sings
and
do
not
people
often
address
you
in
a
very
free
manner
frequently
brother
and
i
give
them
tolerably
free
answers
do
people
ever
offer
to
make
you
presents
i
mean
presents
of
value
such
as
silk
handkerchiefs
shawls
and
trinkets
very
frequently
brother
and
what
do
you
do
ursula
i
takes
what
people
offers
me
brother
and
stows
it
away
as
soon
as
i
can
well
but
do
people
expect
something
for
their
presents
i
mean
dukkerin
dancing
and
the
like
but
such
a
moderate
and
innocent
thing
as
a
choomer
ursula
innocent
thing
do
you
call
it
brother
the
world
calls
it
so
ursula
well
do
the
people
who
give
you
the
fine
things
never
expect
a
choomer
in
return
very
frequently
brother
and
do
you
ever
grant
it
never
brother
how
do
you
avoid
it
i
gets
away
as
soon
as
possible
brother
if
they
follows
me
i
tries
to
baffle
them
by
means
of
jests
and
laughter
and
if
they
persist
i
uses
bad
and
terrible
language
of
which
i
have
plenty
in
store
but
if
your
terrible
language
has
no
effect
then
i
screams
for
the
constable
and
if
he
comes
not
i
uses
my
teeth
and
nails
and
are
they
always
sufficient
i
have
only
had
to
use
them
twice
brother
but
then
i
found
them
sufficient
but
suppose
the
person
who
followed
you
was
highly
agreeable
ursula
a
handsome
young
officer
of
local
militia
for
example
all
dressed
in
lincoln
green
would
you
still
refuse
him
the
choomer
we
makes
no
difference
brother
the
daughters
of
the
makes
no
difference
and
what
more
sees
none
well
ursula
the
world
will
hardly
give
you
credit
for
such
indifference
what
cares
we
for
the
world
brother
we
are
not
of
the
world
but
your
fathers
brothers
and
uncles
give
you
credit
i
suppose
ursula
ay
ay
brother
our
fathers
brothers
and
cokos
gives
us
all
manner
of
credit
for
example
i
am
telling
lies
and
dukkerin
in
a
where
my
batu
or
coko
perhaps
both
are
playing
on
the
fiddle
well
my
batu
and
my
coko
beholds
me
amongst
the
crew
talking
nonsense
and
hearing
nonsense
but
they
are
under
no
apprehension
and
presently
they
sees
the
officer
of
militia
in
his
greens
and
lincolns
get
up
and
give
me
a
wink
and
i
go
out
with
him
abroad
into
the
dark
night
perhaps
well
my
batu
and
my
coko
goes
on
fiddling
just
as
if
i
were
six
miles
off
asleep
in
the
tent
and
not
out
in
the
dark
street
with
the
local
officer
with
his
lincolns
and
his
greens
they
know
they
can
trust
you
ursula
ay
ay
brother
and
what
more
i
knows
i
can
trust
myself
so
you
would
merely
go
out
to
make
a
fool
of
him
ursula
merely
go
out
to
make
a
fool
of
him
brother
i
assure
you
but
such
proceedings
really
have
an
odd
look
ursula
amongst
gorgios
very
so
brother
well
it
must
be
rather
unpleasant
to
lose
one
character
even
amongst
gorgios
ursula
and
suppose
the
officer
out
of
revenge
for
being
tricked
and
duped
by
you
were
to
say
of
you
the
thing
that
is
not
were
to
meet
you
on
the
the
next
day
and
boast
of
receiving
favours
which
he
never
had
amidst
a
knot
of
jeering
how
would
you
proceed
ursula
would
you
not
be
abashed
by
no
means
brother
i
should
bring
my
action
of
law
against
him
your
action
at
law
ursula
yes
brother
i
should
give
a
whistle
whereupon
all
one
cokos
and
batus
and
all
my
near
and
distant
relations
would
leave
their
fiddling
dukkerin
and
and
come
flocking
about
me
the
matter
ursula
says
my
coko
at
all
i
replies
and
except
that
gorgio
in
his
greens
and
his
lincolns
says
that
i
have
played
the
with
him
he
does
ursula
says
my
coko
your
action
of
law
against
him
my
lamb
and
he
puts
something
privily
into
my
hands
whereupon
i
goes
close
up
to
the
grinning
gorgio
and
staring
him
in
the
face
with
my
head
pushed
forward
i
cries
out
say
i
did
what
was
wrong
with
you
last
night
when
i
was
out
with
you
abroad
says
the
local
officer
says
you
did
looking
down
all
the
time
are
a
liar
says
i
and
forthwith
i
breaks
his
head
with
the
stick
which
i
holds
behind
me
and
which
my
coko
has
conveyed
privily
into
my
hand
and
this
is
your
action
at
law
ursula
yes
brother
this
is
my
action
at
and
would
your
breaking
the
fellow
head
quite
clear
you
of
all
suspicion
in
the
eyes
of
your
batus
cokos
and
what
not
they
would
never
suspect
me
at
all
brother
because
they
would
know
that
i
would
never
condescend
to
be
with
a
gorgio
the
breaking
the
head
would
be
merely
intended
to
justify
ursula
in
the
eyes
of
the
gorgios
and
would
it
clear
you
in
their
eyes
would
it
not
brother
when
they
saw
the
blood
running
down
from
the
fellow
cracked
poll
on
his
greens
and
lincolns
they
would
be
quite
satisfied
why
the
fellow
would
not
be
able
to
show
his
face
at
fair
or
for
a
year
and
did
you
ever
try
it
ursula
ca
say
i
ever
did
brother
but
it
would
do
and
how
did
you
ever
learn
such
a
method
of
proceeding
why
is
advised
by
gypsy
liri
brother
it
part
of
our
way
of
settling
difficulties
amongst
ourselves
for
example
if
a
young
roman
were
to
say
the
thing
which
is
not
respecting
ursula
and
himself
ursula
would
call
a
great
meeting
of
the
people
who
would
all
sit
down
in
a
ring
the
young
fellow
amongst
them
a
coko
would
then
put
a
stick
in
ursula
hand
who
would
then
get
up
and
go
to
the
young
fellow
and
say
i
play
the
with
you
and
were
he
to
say
she
would
crack
his
head
before
the
eyes
of
all
well
said
i
ursula
i
was
bred
an
apprentice
to
gorgio
law
and
of
course
ought
to
stand
up
for
it
whenever
i
conscientiously
can
but
i
must
say
the
gypsy
manner
of
bringing
an
action
for
defamation
is
much
less
tedious
and
far
more
satisfactory
than
the
gorgiko
one
i
wish
you
now
to
clear
up
a
certain
point
which
is
rather
mysterious
to
me
you
say
that
for
a
romany
chi
to
do
what
is
unseemly
with
a
gorgio
is
quite
out
of
the
question
yet
only
the
other
day
i
heard
you
singing
a
song
in
which
a
romany
chi
confesses
herself
to
be
cambri
by
a
grand
gorgious
gentleman
a
sad
let
down
said
ursula
well
said
i
sad
or
not
there
the
song
that
speaks
of
the
thing
which
you
give
me
to
understand
is
not
well
if
the
thing
ever
was
said
ursula
it
was
a
long
time
ago
and
perhaps
after
all
not
true
then
why
do
you
sing
the
song
i
tell
you
brother
we
sings
the
song
now
and
then
to
be
a
warning
to
ourselves
to
have
as
little
to
do
as
possible
in
the
way
of
acquaintance
with
the
gorgios
and
a
warning
it
is
you
see
how
the
young
woman
in
the
song
was
driven
out
of
her
tent
by
her
mother
with
all
kind
of
disgrace
and
bad
language
but
you
do
know
that
she
was
afterwards
buried
alive
by
her
cokos
and
pals
in
an
uninhabited
place
the
song
does
say
it
but
the
story
says
it
for
there
is
a
story
about
it
though
as
i
said
before
it
was
a
long
time
ago
and
perhaps
after
all
was
true
but
if
such
a
thing
were
to
happen
at
present
would
the
cokos
and
pals
bury
the
girl
alive
i
ca
say
what
they
would
do
said
ursula
i
suppose
they
are
not
so
strict
as
they
were
long
ago
at
any
rate
she
would
be
driven
from
the
tan
and
avoided
by
all
her
family
and
relations
as
a
acquaintance
so
that
perhaps
at
last
she
would
be
glad
if
they
would
bury
her
alive
well
i
can
conceive
that
there
would
be
an
objection
on
the
part
of
the
cokos
and
batus
that
a
romany
chi
should
form
an
improper
acquaintance
with
a
gorgio
but
i
should
think
that
the
batus
and
cokos
could
hardly
object
to
the
chi
entering
into
the
honourable
estate
of
wedlock
with
a
gorgio
ursula
was
silent
marriage
is
an
honourable
estate
ursula
well
brother
suppose
it
be
i
do
see
why
a
romany
chi
should
object
to
enter
into
the
honourable
estate
of
wedlock
with
a
gorgio
you
do
brother
do
you
no
said
i
and
moreover
i
am
aware
notwithstanding
your
evasion
ursula
that
marriages
and
connections
now
and
then
occur
between
gorgios
and
romany
chies
the
result
of
which
is
the
mixed
breed
called
half
and
half
which
is
at
present
travelling
about
england
and
to
which
the
flaming
tinman
belongs
otherwise
called
anselo
herne
as
for
the
half
and
halfs
said
ursula
they
are
a
bad
set
and
there
is
not
a
worse
blackguard
in
england
than
anselo
herne
all
that
you
say
may
be
very
true
ursula
but
you
admit
that
there
are
half
and
halfs
the
more
the
pity
brother
pity
or
not
you
admit
the
fact
but
how
do
you
account
for
it
how
do
i
account
for
it
why
i
will
tell
you
by
the
break
up
of
a
roman
family
brother
the
father
of
a
small
family
dies
and
perhaps
the
mother
and
the
poor
children
are
left
behind
sometimes
they
are
gathered
up
by
their
relations
and
sometimes
if
they
have
none
by
charitable
romans
who
bring
them
up
in
the
observance
of
gypsy
law
but
sometimes
they
are
not
so
lucky
and
falls
into
the
company
of
gorgios
trampers
and
who
live
in
caravans
with
whom
they
take
up
and
so
i
hate
to
talk
of
the
matter
brother
but
so
comes
this
race
of
the
half
and
halfs
then
you
mean
to
say
ursula
that
no
romany
chi
unless
compelled
by
hard
necessity
would
have
anything
to
do
with
a
gorgio
we
are
not
of
gorgios
brother
and
we
hates
and
folks
that
live
in
caravans
well
said
i
suppose
a
gorgio
who
is
not
a
a
fine
handsome
gorgious
gentleman
who
lives
in
a
fine
house
we
are
not
fond
of
houses
brother
i
never
slept
in
a
house
in
my
life
but
would
not
plenty
of
money
induce
you
i
hate
houses
brother
and
those
who
live
in
them
well
suppose
such
a
person
were
willing
to
resign
his
fine
house
and
for
love
of
you
to
adopt
gypsy
law
speak
romany
and
live
in
a
tan
would
you
have
nothing
to
say
to
him
bringing
plenty
of
money
with
him
brother
well
bringing
plenty
of
money
with
him
ursula
well
brother
suppose
you
produce
your
man
where
is
he
i
was
merely
supposing
such
a
person
ursula
then
you
do
know
of
such
a
person
brother
why
no
ursula
why
do
you
ask
because
brother
i
was
almost
beginning
to
think
that
you
meant
yourself
myself
ursula
i
have
no
fine
house
to
resign
nor
have
i
money
moreover
ursula
though
i
have
a
great
regard
for
you
and
though
i
consider
you
very
handsome
quite
as
handsome
indeed
as
meridiana
in
meridiana
where
did
you
meet
with
her
said
ursula
with
a
toss
of
her
head
why
in
old
pulci
at
old
fulcher
that
not
true
brother
meridiana
is
a
borzlam
and
travels
with
her
own
people
and
not
with
old
fulcher
who
is
a
gorgio
and
a
i
was
not
speaking
of
old
fulcher
but
pulci
a
great
italian
writer
who
lived
many
hundred
years
ago
and
who
in
his
poem
called
maggiore
speaks
of
meridiana
the
daughter
of
old
carus
borzlam
said
ursula
but
if
the
fellow
you
mention
lived
so
many
hundred
years
ago
how
in
the
name
of
wonder
could
he
know
anything
of
meridiana
the
wonder
ursula
is
how
your
people
could
ever
have
got
hold
of
that
name
and
similar
ones
the
meridiana
of
pulci
was
not
the
daughter
of
old
carus
borzlam
but
of
caradoro
a
great
pagan
king
of
the
east
who
being
besieged
in
his
capital
by
manfredonio
another
mighty
pagan
king
who
wished
to
obtain
possession
of
his
daughter
who
had
refused
him
was
relieved
in
his
distress
by
certain
paladins
of
charlemagne
with
one
of
whom
oliver
his
daughter
meridiana
fell
in
love
i
see
said
ursula
that
it
must
have
been
altogether
a
different
person
for
i
am
sure
that
meridiana
borzlam
would
never
have
fallen
in
love
with
oliver
oliver
why
that
is
the
name
of
the
who
lost
the
fight
near
the
chong
gav
the
day
of
the
great
tempest
when
i
got
wet
through
no
no
meridiana
borzlam
would
never
have
so
far
forgot
her
blood
as
to
take
up
with
tom
oliver
i
was
not
talking
of
that
oliver
ursula
but
of
oliver
peer
of
france
and
paladin
of
charlemagne
with
whom
meridiana
daughter
of
caradoro
fell
in
love
and
for
whose
sake
she
renounced
her
religion
and
became
a
christian
and
finally
ingravidata
or
cambri
by
him
nacquene
un
figliuol
dice
la
storia
che
dette
a
poi
gran
vittoria
which
means
i
do
want
to
know
what
it
means
said
ursula
no
good
i
sure
well
if
the
meridiana
of
charles
wain
pal
was
no
handsomer
than
meridiana
borzlam
she
was
no
great
catch
brother
for
though
i
am
by
no
means
given
to
vanity
i
think
myself
better
to
look
at
than
she
though
i
will
say
she
is
no
lubbeny
and
would
scorn
i
make
no
doubt
she
would
ursula
and
i
make
no
doubt
that
you
are
much
handsomer
than
she
or
even
the
meridiana
of
oliver
what
i
was
about
to
say
before
you
interrupted
me
is
this
that
though
i
have
a
great
regard
for
you
and
highly
admire
you
it
is
only
in
a
brotherly
way
and
and
you
had
nothing
better
to
say
to
me
said
ursula
when
you
wanted
to
talk
to
me
beneath
a
hedge
than
that
you
liked
me
in
a
brotherly
way
i
well
i
declare
you
seem
disappointed
ursula
disappointed
brother
not
i
you
were
just
now
saying
that
you
disliked
gorgios
so
of
course
could
only
wish
that
i
who
am
a
gorgio
should
like
you
in
a
brotherly
way
i
wished
to
have
a
conversation
with
you
beneath
a
hedge
but
only
with
the
view
of
procuring
from
you
some
information
respecting
the
song
which
you
sung
the
other
day
and
the
conduct
of
roman
females
which
has
always
struck
me
as
being
highly
unaccountable
so
if
you
thought
anything
else
what
else
should
i
expect
from
a
of
old
words
brother
bah
i
dislike
a
of
old
words
worse
than
a
of
old
rags
do
be
angry
ursula
i
feel
a
great
interest
in
you
you
are
very
handsome
and
very
clever
indeed
with
your
beauty
and
cleverness
i
only
wonder
that
you
have
not
long
since
been
married
you
do
do
you
brother
yes
however
keep
up
your
spirits
ursula
you
are
not
much
past
the
prime
of
youth
so
not
much
past
the
prime
of
youth
do
be
uncivil
brother
i
was
only
last
month
do
be
offended
ursula
but
is
or
i
should
rather
say
that
in
a
woman
is
more
than
in
a
man
you
are
still
very
beautiful
but
i
advise
you
to
accept
the
first
offer
that
made
to
you
thank
you
brother
but
your
advice
comes
rather
late
i
accepted
the
first
offer
that
was
made
me
five
years
ago
you
married
five
years
ago
ursula
is
it
possible
quite
possible
brother
i
assure
you
and
how
came
i
to
know
nothing
about
it
how
comes
it
that
you
do
know
many
thousand
things
about
the
romans
brother
do
you
think
they
tell
you
all
their
affairs
married
ursula
married
well
i
declare
you
seem
disappointed
brother
disappointed
oh
no
not
at
all
but
jasper
only
a
few
weeks
ago
told
me
that
you
were
not
married
and
indeed
almost
gave
me
to
understand
that
you
would
be
very
glad
to
get
a
husband
and
you
believed
him
i
tell
you
brother
for
your
instruction
that
there
is
not
in
the
whole
world
a
greater
liar
than
jasper
petulengro
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
ursula
but
with
respect
to
him
you
married
who
might
he
be
a
gorgio
or
a
romany
chal
gorgio
or
romany
chal
do
you
think
i
would
ever
condescend
to
a
gorgio
it
was
a
camomescro
brother
a
lovell
a
distant
relation
of
my
own
and
where
is
he
and
what
became
of
him
have
you
any
family
do
think
i
am
going
to
tell
you
all
my
history
brother
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
tired
of
sitting
under
hedges
with
you
talking
nonsense
i
shall
go
to
my
house
do
sit
a
little
longer
sister
ursula
i
most
heartily
congratulate
you
on
your
marriage
but
where
is
this
same
lovell
i
have
never
seen
him
i
wish
to
congratulate
him
too
you
are
quite
as
handsome
as
the
meridiana
of
pulci
ursula
ay
or
the
despina
of
riciardetto
riciardetto
ursula
is
a
poem
written
by
one
fortiguerra
about
ninety
years
ago
in
imitation
of
the
morgante
of
pulci
it
treats
of
the
wars
of
charlemagne
and
his
paladins
with
various
barbarous
nations
who
came
to
besiege
paris
despina
was
the
daughter
and
heiress
of
scricca
king
of
cafria
she
was
the
beloved
of
riciardetto
and
was
beautiful
as
an
angel
but
i
make
no
doubt
you
are
quite
as
handsome
as
she
brother
said
ursula
but
the
reply
of
ursula
i
reserve
for
another
chapter
the
present
having
attained
to
rather
an
uncommon
length
for
which
however
the
importance
of
the
matter
discussed
is
a
sufficient
apology
chapter
xi
ursula
tale
the
patteran
the
deep
water
second
husband
brother
said
ursula
plucking
a
dandelion
which
grew
at
her
feet
i
have
always
said
that
a
more
civil
and
person
than
yourself
ca
be
found
i
have
a
great
regard
for
you
and
your
learning
and
am
willing
to
do
you
any
pleasure
in
the
way
of
words
or
conversation
mine
is
not
a
very
happy
story
but
as
you
wish
to
hear
it
it
is
quite
at
your
service
launcelot
lovell
made
me
an
offer
as
you
call
it
and
we
were
married
in
roman
fashion
that
is
we
gave
each
other
our
right
hands
and
promised
to
be
true
to
each
other
we
lived
together
two
years
travelling
sometimes
by
ourselves
sometimes
with
our
relations
i
bore
him
two
children
both
of
which
were
partly
i
believe
from
the
fatigue
i
underwent
in
running
about
the
country
telling
dukkerin
when
i
was
not
exactly
in
a
state
to
do
so
and
partly
from
the
kicks
and
blows
which
my
husband
launcelot
was
in
the
habit
of
giving
me
every
night
provided
i
came
home
with
less
than
five
shillings
which
it
is
sometimes
impossible
to
make
in
the
country
provided
no
fair
or
is
going
on
at
the
end
of
two
years
my
husband
launcelot
whistled
a
horse
from
a
farmer
field
and
sold
it
for
and
for
that
horse
he
was
taken
put
in
prison
tried
and
condemned
to
be
sent
to
the
other
country
for
life
two
days
before
he
was
to
be
sent
away
i
got
leave
to
see
him
in
the
prison
and
in
the
presence
of
the
turnkey
i
gave
him
a
thin
cake
of
gingerbread
in
which
there
was
a
dainty
saw
which
could
cut
through
iron
i
then
took
on
wonderfully
turned
my
eyes
inside
out
fell
down
in
a
seeming
fit
and
was
carried
out
of
the
prison
that
same
night
my
husband
sawed
his
irons
off
cut
through
the
bars
of
his
window
and
dropping
down
a
height
of
fifty
feet
lighted
on
his
legs
and
came
and
joined
me
on
a
heath
where
i
was
camped
alone
we
were
just
getting
things
ready
to
be
off
when
we
heard
people
coming
and
sure
enough
they
were
runners
after
my
husband
launcelot
lovell
for
his
escape
had
been
discovered
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
he
had
got
away
my
husband
without
bidding
me
farewell
set
off
at
full
speed
and
they
after
him
but
they
could
not
take
him
and
so
they
came
back
and
took
me
and
shook
me
and
threatened
me
and
had
me
before
the
poknees
who
shook
his
head
at
me
and
threatened
me
in
order
to
make
me
discover
where
my
husband
was
but
i
said
i
did
not
know
which
was
true
enough
not
that
i
would
have
told
him
if
i
had
so
at
last
the
poknees
and
the
runners
not
being
able
to
make
anything
out
of
me
were
obliged
to
let
me
go
and
i
went
in
search
of
my
husband
i
wandered
about
with
my
cart
for
several
days
in
the
direction
in
which
i
saw
him
run
off
with
my
eyes
bent
on
the
ground
but
could
see
no
marks
of
him
at
last
coming
to
four
cross
roads
i
saw
my
husband
patteran
you
saw
your
husband
patteran
yes
brother
do
you
know
what
patteran
means
of
course
ursula
the
gypsy
trail
the
handful
of
grass
which
the
gypsies
strew
in
the
roads
as
they
travel
to
give
information
to
any
of
their
companions
who
may
be
behind
as
to
the
route
they
have
taken
the
gypsy
patteran
has
always
had
a
strange
interest
for
me
ursula
like
enough
brother
but
what
does
patteran
mean
why
the
gypsy
trail
formed
as
i
told
you
before
and
you
know
nothing
more
about
patteran
brother
nothing
at
all
ursula
do
you
what
the
name
for
the
leaf
of
a
tree
brother
i
do
know
said
i
it
odd
enough
that
i
have
asked
that
question
of
a
dozen
romany
chals
and
chies
and
they
always
told
me
that
they
did
not
know
no
more
they
did
brother
there
only
one
person
in
england
that
knows
and
that
myself
the
name
for
a
leaf
is
patteran
now
there
are
two
that
knows
it
the
other
is
yourself
dear
me
ursula
how
very
strange
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
i
think
i
never
saw
you
look
so
pretty
as
you
do
now
but
who
told
you
my
mother
herne
told
it
me
one
day
brother
when
she
was
in
a
good
humour
which
she
very
seldom
was
as
no
one
has
a
better
right
to
know
than
yourself
as
she
hated
you
mortally
it
was
one
day
when
you
had
been
asking
our
company
what
was
the
word
for
a
leaf
and
nobody
could
tell
you
that
she
took
me
aside
and
told
me
for
she
was
in
a
good
humour
and
triumphed
in
seeing
you
balked
she
told
me
the
word
for
leaf
was
patteran
which
our
people
use
now
for
trail
having
forgotten
the
true
meaning
she
said
that
the
trail
was
called
patteran
because
the
gypsies
of
old
were
in
the
habit
of
making
the
marks
with
the
leaves
and
branches
of
trees
placed
in
a
certain
manner
she
said
that
nobody
knew
it
but
herself
who
was
one
of
the
old
sort
and
begged
me
never
to
tell
the
word
to
any
one
but
him
i
should
marry
and
to
be
particularly
cautious
never
to
let
you
know
it
whom
she
hated
well
brother
perhaps
i
have
done
wrong
to
tell
you
but
as
i
said
before
i
likes
you
and
am
always
ready
to
do
your
pleasure
in
words
and
conversation
my
mother
moreover
is
dead
and
gone
and
poor
thing
will
never
know
anything
about
the
matter
so
when
i
married
i
told
my
husband
about
the
patteran
and
we
were
in
the
habit
of
making
our
private
trails
with
leaves
and
branches
of
trees
which
none
of
the
other
gypsy
people
did
so
when
i
saw
my
husband
patteran
i
knew
it
at
once
and
i
followed
it
upwards
of
two
hundred
miles
towards
the
north
and
then
i
came
to
a
deep
water
with
an
overhanging
bank
and
on
the
bank
i
found
the
patteran
which
directed
me
to
proceed
along
the
bank
towards
the
east
and
i
followed
my
husband
patteran
towards
the
east
and
before
i
had
gone
half
a
mile
i
came
to
a
place
where
i
saw
the
bank
had
given
way
and
fallen
into
the
deep
water
without
paying
much
heed
i
passed
on
and
presently
came
to
a
not
far
from
the
water
and
i
entered
the
to
get
a
little
beer
and
perhaps
to
tell
a
dukkerin
for
i
saw
a
great
many
people
about
the
door
and
when
i
entered
i
found
there
was
what
they
calls
an
inquest
being
held
upon
a
body
in
that
house
and
the
jury
had
just
risen
to
go
and
look
at
the
body
and
being
a
woman
and
having
a
curiosity
i
thought
i
would
go
with
them
and
so
i
did
and
no
sooner
did
i
see
the
body
than
i
knew
it
to
be
my
husband
it
was
much
swelled
and
altered
but
i
knew
it
partly
by
the
clothes
and
partly
by
a
mark
on
the
forehead
and
i
cried
out
is
my
husband
body
and
i
fell
down
in
a
fit
and
the
fit
that
time
brother
was
not
a
seeming
one
dear
me
said
i
how
terrible
but
tell
me
ursula
how
did
your
husband
come
by
his
death
the
bank
overhanging
the
deep
water
gave
way
under
him
brother
and
he
was
drowned
for
like
most
of
our
people
he
could
not
swim
or
only
a
little
the
body
after
it
had
been
in
the
water
a
long
time
came
up
of
itself
and
was
found
floating
well
brother
when
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
found
that
i
was
the
wife
of
the
drowned
man
they
were
very
kind
to
me
and
made
a
subscription
for
me
with
which
after
having
seen
my
husband
buried
i
returned
the
way
i
had
come
till
i
met
jasper
and
his
people
and
with
them
i
have
travelled
ever
since
i
was
very
melancholy
for
a
long
time
i
assure
you
brother
for
the
death
of
my
husband
preyed
very
much
upon
my
mind
his
death
was
certainly
a
very
shocking
one
ursula
but
really
if
he
had
died
a
natural
one
you
could
scarcely
have
regretted
it
for
he
appears
to
have
treated
you
barbarously
women
must
bear
brother
and
barring
that
he
kicked
and
beat
me
and
drove
me
out
to
tell
dukkerin
when
i
could
scarcely
stand
he
was
not
a
bad
husband
a
man
by
gypsy
law
brother
is
allowed
to
kick
and
beat
his
wife
and
to
bury
her
alive
if
he
thinks
proper
i
am
a
gypsy
and
have
nothing
to
say
against
the
law
but
what
has
mikailia
chikno
to
say
about
it
she
is
a
cripple
brother
the
only
cripple
amongst
the
roman
people
so
she
is
allowed
to
do
and
say
as
she
pleases
moreover
her
husband
does
not
think
fit
to
kick
or
beat
her
though
it
is
my
opinion
she
would
like
him
all
the
better
if
he
were
occasionally
to
do
so
and
threaten
to
bury
her
alive
at
any
rate
she
would
treat
him
better
and
respect
him
more
your
sister
does
not
seem
to
stand
much
in
awe
of
jasper
petulengro
ursula
let
the
matters
of
my
sister
and
jasper
petulengro
alone
brother
you
must
travel
in
their
company
some
time
before
you
can
understand
them
they
are
a
strange
two
up
to
all
kind
of
chaffing
but
two
more
regular
romans
do
breathe
and
i
tell
you
for
your
instruction
that
there
is
a
better
in
england
than
jasper
petulengro
if
you
can
manage
miss
isopel
berners
as
well
as
isopel
berners
said
i
how
came
you
to
think
of
her
how
should
i
but
think
of
her
brother
living
as
she
does
with
you
in
mumper
dingle
and
travelling
about
with
you
you
will
have
brother
more
difficulty
to
manage
her
than
jasper
has
to
manage
my
sister
pakomovna
i
should
have
mentioned
her
before
only
i
wanted
to
know
what
you
had
to
say
to
me
and
when
we
got
into
discourse
i
forgot
her
i
say
brother
let
me
tell
you
your
dukkerin
with
respect
to
her
you
will
never
i
want
to
hear
no
dukkerin
ursula
do
let
me
tell
you
your
dukkerin
brother
you
will
never
manage
i
want
to
hear
no
dukkerin
ursula
in
connection
with
isopel
berners
moreover
it
is
sunday
we
will
change
the
subject
it
is
surprising
to
me
that
after
all
you
have
undergone
you
should
look
so
beautiful
i
suppose
you
do
not
think
of
marrying
again
ursula
no
brother
one
husband
at
a
time
is
quite
enough
for
any
reasonable
mort
especially
such
a
good
husband
as
i
have
got
such
a
good
husband
why
i
thought
you
told
me
your
husband
was
drowned
yes
brother
my
first
husband
was
and
have
you
a
second
to
be
sure
brother
and
who
is
he
in
the
name
of
wonder
who
is
he
why
sylvester
to
be
sure
i
do
assure
you
ursula
that
i
feel
disposed
to
be
angry
with
you
such
a
handsome
young
woman
as
yourself
to
take
up
with
such
a
nasty
faced
good
for
nothing
i
wo
hear
my
husband
abused
brother
so
you
had
better
say
no
more
why
is
he
not
the
lazarus
of
the
gypsies
has
he
a
penny
of
his
own
ursula
then
the
more
his
want
brother
of
a
clever
chi
like
me
to
take
care
of
him
and
his
childer
i
tell
you
what
brother
i
will
chore
if
necessary
and
tell
dukkerin
for
sylvester
if
even
so
heavy
as
scarcely
to
be
able
to
stand
you
call
him
lazy
you
would
not
think
him
lazy
if
you
were
in
a
ring
with
him
he
is
a
proper
man
with
his
hands
jasper
is
going
to
back
him
for
twenty
pounds
against
slammocks
of
the
chong
gav
the
brother
of
roarer
and
he
says
he
has
no
doubt
that
he
will
win
well
if
you
like
him
i
of
course
can
have
no
objection
have
you
been
long
married
about
a
fortnight
brother
that
dinner
the
other
day
when
i
sang
the
song
was
given
in
celebration
of
the
wedding
were
you
married
in
a
church
ursula
we
were
not
brother
none
but
gorgios
cripples
and
lubbenys
are
ever
married
in
a
church
we
took
each
other
words
brother
i
have
been
with
you
near
three
hours
beneath
this
hedge
i
will
go
to
my
husband
does
he
know
that
you
are
here
he
does
brother
and
is
he
satisfied
satisfied
of
course
lor
you
gorgies
brother
i
go
to
my
husband
and
my
house
and
thereupon
ursula
rose
and
departed
after
waiting
a
little
time
i
also
arose
it
was
now
dark
and
i
thought
i
could
do
no
better
than
betake
myself
to
the
dingle
at
the
entrance
of
it
i
found
petulengro
well
brother
said
he
what
kind
of
conversation
have
you
and
ursula
had
beneath
the
hedge
if
you
wished
to
hear
what
we
were
talking
about
you
should
have
come
and
sat
down
beside
us
you
knew
where
we
were
well
brother
i
did
much
the
same
for
i
went
and
sat
down
behind
you
behind
the
hedge
jasper
behind
the
hedge
brother
and
heard
all
our
conversation
every
word
brother
and
a
rum
conversation
it
was
is
an
old
saying
jasper
that
listeners
never
hear
any
good
of
themselves
perhaps
you
heard
the
epithet
that
ursula
bestowed
upon
you
if
by
epitaph
you
mean
that
she
called
me
a
liar
i
did
brother
and
she
was
not
much
wrong
for
i
certainly
do
not
always
stick
exactly
to
truth
you
however
have
not
much
to
complain
of
me
you
deceived
me
about
ursula
giving
me
to
understand
she
was
not
married
she
was
not
married
when
i
told
you
so
brother
that
is
not
to
sylvester
nor
was
i
aware
that
she
was
going
to
marry
him
i
once
thought
you
had
a
kind
of
regard
for
her
and
i
am
sure
she
had
as
much
for
you
as
a
romany
chi
can
have
for
a
gorgio
i
half
expected
to
have
heard
you
make
love
to
her
behind
the
hedge
but
i
begin
to
think
you
care
for
nothing
in
this
world
but
old
words
and
strange
stories
to
take
a
young
woman
under
a
hedge
and
talk
to
her
as
you
did
to
ursula
and
yet
you
got
everything
out
of
her
that
you
wanted
with
your
gammon
about
old
fulcher
and
meridiana
you
are
a
cunning
one
brother
there
you
are
mistaken
jasper
i
am
not
cunning
if
people
think
i
am
it
is
because
being
made
up
of
art
themselves
simplicity
of
character
is
a
puzzle
to
them
your
women
are
certainly
extraordinary
creatures
jasper
did
i
say
they
were
rum
animals
brother
we
romans
shall
always
stick
together
as
long
as
they
stick
fast
to
us
do
you
think
they
always
will
jasper
ca
say
brother
nothing
lasts
for
ever
romany
chies
are
romany
chies
still
though
not
exactly
what
they
were
sixty
years
ago
my
wife
though
a
rum
one
is
not
herne
brother
i
think
she
is
rather
fond
of
frenchmen
and
french
discourse
i
tell
you
what
brother
if
ever
gypsyism
breaks
up
it
will
be
owing
to
our
chies
having
been
bitten
by
that
mad
puppy
they
calls
gentility
chapter
xii
the
dingle
at
night
the
two
sides
of
the
question
roman
females
filling
the
kettle
the
dream
the
tall
figure
i
descended
to
the
bottom
of
the
dingle
it
was
nearly
involved
in
obscurity
to
dissipate
the
feeling
of
melancholy
which
came
over
my
mind
i
resolved
to
kindle
a
fire
and
having
heaped
dry
sticks
upon
my
hearth
and
added
a
billet
or
two
i
struck
a
light
and
soon
produced
a
blaze
sitting
down
i
fixed
my
eyes
upon
the
blaze
and
soon
fell
into
a
deep
meditation
i
thought
of
the
events
of
the
day
the
scene
at
church
and
what
i
had
heard
at
church
the
danger
of
losing
one
soul
the
doubts
of
jasper
petulengro
as
to
whether
one
had
a
soul
i
thought
over
the
various
arguments
which
i
had
either
heard
or
which
had
come
spontaneously
to
my
mind
for
or
against
the
probability
of
a
state
of
future
existence
they
appeared
to
me
to
be
tolerably
evenly
balanced
i
then
thought
that
it
was
at
all
events
taking
the
safest
part
to
conclude
that
there
was
a
soul
it
would
be
a
terrible
thing
after
having
passed
one
life
in
the
disbelief
of
the
existence
of
a
soul
to
wake
up
after
death
a
soul
and
to
find
one
self
a
lost
soul
yes
methought
i
would
come
to
the
conclusion
that
one
has
a
soul
choosing
the
safe
side
however
appeared
to
me
to
be
playing
a
rather
dastardly
part
i
had
never
been
an
admirer
of
people
who
chose
the
safe
side
in
everything
indeed
i
had
always
entertained
a
thorough
contempt
for
them
surely
it
would
be
showing
more
manhood
to
adopt
the
dangerous
side
that
of
disbelief
i
almost
resolved
to
do
so
but
yet
in
a
question
of
so
much
importance
i
ought
not
to
be
guided
by
vanity
the
question
was
not
which
was
the
safe
but
the
true
side
yet
how
was
i
to
know
which
was
the
true
side
then
i
thought
of
the
bible
which
i
had
been
reading
in
the
morning
that
spoke
of
the
soul
and
a
future
state
but
was
the
bible
true
i
had
heard
learned
and
moral
men
say
that
it
was
true
but
i
had
also
heard
learned
and
moral
men
say
that
it
was
not
how
was
i
to
decide
still
that
balance
of
probabilities
if
i
could
but
see
the
way
of
truth
i
would
follow
it
if
necessary
upon
hands
and
knees
on
that
i
was
determined
but
i
could
not
see
it
feeling
my
brain
begin
to
turn
round
i
resolved
to
think
of
something
else
and
forthwith
began
to
think
of
what
had
passed
between
ursula
and
myself
in
our
discourse
beneath
the
hedge
i
mused
deeply
on
what
she
had
told
me
as
to
the
virtue
of
the
females
of
her
race
how
singular
that
virtue
must
be
which
was
kept
pure
and
immaculate
by
the
possessor
whilst
indulging
in
habits
of
falsehood
and
dishonesty
i
had
always
thought
the
gypsy
females
extraordinary
beings
i
had
often
wondered
at
them
their
dress
their
manner
of
speaking
and
not
least
at
their
names
but
until
the
present
day
i
had
been
unacquainted
with
the
most
extraordinary
point
connected
with
them
how
came
they
possessed
of
this
extraordinary
virtue
was
it
because
they
were
thievish
i
remembered
that
an
ancient
who
had
retired
from
his
useful
calling
and
who
frequently
visited
the
office
of
my
master
at
law
the
respectable
s
who
had
the
management
of
his
property
i
remembered
to
have
heard
this
worthy
with
whom
i
occasionally
held
discourse
philosophic
and
profound
when
he
and
i
chanced
to
be
alone
together
in
the
office
say
that
all
thieves
were
sober
and
of
morals
their
bodily
passions
being
kept
in
abeyance
by
their
love
of
gain
but
this
axiom
could
scarcely
hold
good
with
respect
to
these
women
however
thievish
they
might
be
they
did
care
for
something
besides
gain
they
cared
for
their
husbands
if
they
did
thieve
they
merely
thieved
for
their
husbands
and
though
perhaps
some
of
them
were
vain
they
merely
prized
their
beauty
because
it
gave
them
favour
in
the
eyes
of
their
husbands
whatever
the
husbands
were
and
jasper
had
almost
insinuated
that
the
males
occasionally
allowed
themselves
some
latitude
they
appeared
to
be
as
faithful
to
their
husbands
as
the
ancient
roman
matrons
were
to
theirs
roman
matrons
and
after
all
might
not
these
be
in
reality
roman
matrons
they
called
themselves
romans
might
not
they
be
the
descendants
of
the
old
roman
matrons
might
not
they
be
of
the
same
blood
as
lucretia
and
were
not
many
of
their
strange
names
lucretia
amongst
the
rest
handed
down
to
them
from
old
rome
it
is
true
their
language
was
not
that
of
old
rome
it
was
not
however
altogether
different
from
it
after
all
the
ancient
romans
might
be
a
tribe
of
these
people
who
settled
down
and
founded
a
village
with
the
tilts
of
carts
which
by
degrees
and
the
influx
of
other
people
became
the
grand
city
of
the
world
i
liked
the
idea
of
the
grand
city
of
the
world
owing
its
origin
to
a
people
who
had
been
in
the
habit
of
carrying
their
houses
in
their
carts
why
after
all
should
not
the
romans
of
history
be
a
branch
of
these
romans
there
were
several
points
of
similarity
between
them
if
roman
matrons
were
chaste
both
men
and
women
were
thieves
old
rome
was
the
thief
of
the
world
yet
still
there
were
difficulties
to
be
removed
before
i
could
persuade
myself
that
the
old
romans
and
my
romans
were
identical
and
in
trying
to
remove
these
difficulties
i
felt
my
brain
once
more
beginning
to
turn
and
in
haste
took
up
another
subject
of
meditation
and
that
was
the
patteran
and
what
ursula
had
told
me
about
it
i
had
always
entertained
a
strange
interest
for
that
sign
by
which
in
their
wanderings
the
romanese
gave
to
those
of
their
people
who
came
behind
intimation
as
to
the
direction
which
they
took
but
it
now
inspired
me
with
greater
interest
than
ever
now
that
i
had
learnt
that
the
proper
meaning
of
it
was
the
leaves
of
trees
i
had
as
i
had
said
in
my
dialogue
with
ursula
been
very
eager
to
learn
the
word
for
leaf
in
the
romanian
language
but
had
never
learnt
it
till
this
day
so
patteran
signified
leaf
of
a
tree
and
no
one
at
present
knew
that
but
myself
and
ursula
who
had
learnt
it
from
herne
the
last
it
was
said
of
the
old
stock
and
then
i
thought
what
strange
people
the
gypsies
must
have
been
in
the
old
time
they
were
sufficiently
strange
at
present
but
they
must
have
been
far
stranger
of
old
they
must
have
been
a
more
peculiar
people
their
language
must
have
been
more
perfect
and
they
must
have
had
a
greater
stock
of
strange
secrets
i
almost
wished
that
i
had
lived
some
two
or
three
hundred
years
ago
that
i
might
have
observed
these
people
when
they
were
yet
stranger
than
at
present
i
wondered
whether
i
could
have
introduced
myself
to
their
company
at
that
period
whether
i
should
have
been
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
such
a
strange
malicious
half
being
as
jasper
who
would
have
instructed
me
in
the
language
then
more
deserving
of
note
than
at
present
what
might
i
not
have
done
with
that
language
had
i
known
it
in
its
purity
why
i
might
have
written
books
in
it
yet
those
who
spoke
it
would
hardly
have
admitted
me
to
their
society
at
that
period
when
they
kept
more
to
themselves
yet
i
thought
that
i
might
possibly
have
gained
their
confidence
and
have
wandered
about
with
them
and
learnt
their
language
and
all
their
strange
ways
and
then
and
then
and
a
sigh
rose
from
the
depth
of
my
breast
for
i
began
to
think
supposing
i
had
accomplished
all
this
what
would
have
been
the
profit
of
it
and
in
what
would
all
this
wild
gypsy
dream
have
terminated
then
rose
another
sigh
yet
more
profound
for
i
began
to
think
what
was
likely
to
be
the
profit
of
my
present
way
of
life
the
living
in
dingles
making
pony
and
donkey
shoes
conversing
with
under
hedges
and
extracting
from
them
their
odd
secrets
what
was
likely
to
be
the
profit
of
such
a
kind
of
life
even
should
it
continue
for
a
length
of
time
a
supposition
not
very
probable
for
i
was
earning
nothing
to
support
me
and
the
funds
with
which
i
had
entered
upon
this
life
were
gradually
disappearing
i
was
living
it
is
true
not
unpleasantly
enjoying
the
healthy
air
of
heaven
but
upon
the
whole
was
i
not
sadly
misspending
my
time
surely
i
was
and
as
i
looked
back
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
had
always
been
doing
so
what
had
been
the
profit
of
the
tongues
which
i
had
learnt
had
they
ever
assisted
me
in
the
day
of
hunger
no
no
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
had
always
misspent
my
time
save
in
one
instance
when
by
a
desperate
effort
i
had
collected
all
the
powers
of
my
imagination
and
written
the
life
of
joseph
sell
but
even
when
i
wrote
the
life
of
sell
was
i
not
in
a
false
position
provided
i
had
not
misspent
my
time
would
it
have
been
necessary
to
make
that
effort
which
after
all
had
only
enabled
me
to
leave
london
and
wander
about
the
country
for
a
time
but
could
i
taking
all
circumstances
into
consideration
have
done
better
than
i
had
with
my
peculiar
temperament
and
ideas
could
i
have
pursued
with
advantage
the
profession
to
which
my
respectable
parents
had
endeavoured
to
bring
me
up
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
could
not
and
that
the
hand
of
necessity
had
guided
me
from
my
earliest
years
until
the
present
night
in
which
i
found
myself
seated
in
the
dingle
staring
on
the
brands
of
the
fire
but
ceasing
to
think
of
the
past
which
as
irrecoverably
gone
it
was
useless
to
regret
even
were
there
cause
to
regret
it
what
should
i
do
in
future
should
i
write
another
book
like
the
life
of
joseph
sell
take
it
to
london
and
offer
it
to
a
publisher
but
when
i
reflected
on
the
grisly
sufferings
which
i
had
undergone
whilst
engaged
in
writing
the
life
of
sell
i
shrank
from
the
idea
of
a
similar
attempt
moreover
i
doubted
whether
i
possessed
the
power
to
write
a
similar
work
whether
the
materials
for
the
life
of
another
sell
lurked
within
the
recesses
of
my
brain
had
i
not
better
become
in
reality
what
i
had
hitherto
been
merely
playing
at
a
tinker
or
a
gypsy
but
i
soon
saw
that
i
was
not
fitted
to
become
either
in
reality
it
was
much
more
agreeable
to
play
the
gypsy
or
the
tinker
than
to
become
either
in
reality
i
had
seen
enough
of
gypsying
and
tinkering
to
be
convinced
of
that
all
of
a
sudden
the
idea
of
tilling
the
soil
came
into
my
head
tilling
the
soil
was
a
healthful
and
noble
pursuit
but
my
idea
of
tilling
the
soil
had
no
connection
with
britain
for
i
could
only
expect
to
till
the
soil
in
britain
as
a
serf
i
thought
of
tilling
it
in
america
in
which
it
was
said
there
was
plenty
of
wild
unclaimed
land
of
which
any
one
who
chose
to
clear
it
of
its
trees
might
take
possession
i
figured
myself
in
america
in
an
immense
forest
clearing
the
land
destined
by
my
exertions
to
become
a
fruitful
and
smiling
plain
methought
i
heard
the
crash
of
the
huge
trees
as
they
fell
beneath
my
axe
and
then
i
bethought
me
that
a
man
was
intended
to
marry
i
ought
to
marry
and
if
i
married
where
was
i
likely
to
be
more
happy
as
a
husband
and
a
father
than
in
america
engaged
in
tilling
the
ground
i
fancied
myself
in
america
engaged
in
tilling
the
ground
assisted
by
an
enormous
progeny
well
why
not
marry
and
go
and
till
the
ground
in
america
i
was
young
and
youth
was
the
time
to
marry
in
and
to
labour
in
i
had
the
use
of
all
my
faculties
my
eyes
it
is
true
were
rather
dull
from
early
study
and
from
writing
the
life
of
joseph
sell
but
i
could
see
tolerably
well
with
them
and
they
were
not
bleared
i
felt
my
arms
and
thighs
and
teeth
they
were
strong
and
sound
enough
so
now
was
the
time
to
labour
to
marry
eat
strong
flesh
and
beget
strong
children
the
power
of
doing
all
this
would
pass
away
with
youth
which
was
terribly
transitory
i
bethought
me
that
a
time
would
come
when
my
eyes
would
be
bleared
and
perhaps
sightless
my
arms
and
thighs
strengthless
and
sapless
when
my
teeth
would
shake
in
my
jaws
even
supposing
they
did
not
drop
out
no
going
a
wooing
then
no
labouring
no
eating
strong
flesh
and
begetting
lusty
children
then
and
i
bethought
me
how
when
all
this
should
be
i
should
bewail
the
days
of
my
youth
as
misspent
provided
i
had
not
in
them
founded
for
myself
a
home
and
begotten
strong
children
to
take
care
of
me
in
the
days
when
i
could
not
take
care
of
myself
and
thinking
of
these
things
i
became
sadder
and
sadder
and
stared
vacantly
upon
the
fire
till
my
eyes
closed
in
a
doze
i
continued
dozing
over
the
fire
until
rousing
myself
i
perceived
that
the
brands
were
nearly
consumed
and
i
thought
of
retiring
for
the
night
i
arose
and
was
about
to
enter
my
tent
when
a
thought
struck
me
suppose
thought
i
that
isopel
berners
should
return
in
the
midst
of
the
night
how
dark
and
dreary
would
the
dingle
appear
without
a
fire
truly
i
will
keep
up
the
fire
and
i
will
do
more
i
have
no
board
to
spread
for
her
but
i
will
fill
the
kettle
and
heat
it
so
that
if
she
comes
i
may
be
able
to
welcome
her
with
a
cup
of
tea
for
i
know
she
loves
tea
thereupon
i
piled
more
wood
upon
the
fire
and
soon
succeeded
in
procuring
a
better
blaze
than
before
then
taking
the
kettle
i
set
out
for
the
spring
on
arriving
at
the
mouth
of
the
dingle
which
fronted
the
east
i
perceived
that
charles
wain
was
nearly
opposite
to
it
high
above
in
the
heavens
by
which
i
knew
that
the
night
was
tolerably
well
advanced
the
gypsy
encampment
lay
before
me
all
was
hushed
and
still
within
it
and
its
inmates
appeared
to
be
locked
in
slumber
as
i
advanced
however
the
dogs
which
were
fastened
outside
the
tents
growled
and
barked
but
presently
recognising
me
they
were
again
silent
some
of
them
wagging
their
tails
as
i
drew
near
a
particular
tent
i
heard
a
female
voice
say
some
one
is
coming
and
as
i
was
about
to
pass
it
the
cloth
which
formed
the
door
was
suddenly
lifted
up
and
a
black
head
and
part
of
a
huge
naked
body
protruded
it
was
the
head
and
upper
part
of
the
giant
tawno
who
according
to
the
fashion
of
gypsy
men
lay
next
the
door
wrapped
in
his
blanket
the
blanket
had
however
fallen
off
and
the
starlight
shone
clear
on
his
athletic
tawny
body
and
was
reflected
from
his
large
staring
eyes
it
is
only
i
tawno
said
i
going
to
fill
the
kettle
as
it
is
possible
that
miss
berners
may
arrive
this
night
drawled
out
tawno
and
replaced
the
curtain
good
do
you
call
it
said
the
sharp
voice
of
his
wife
there
is
no
good
in
the
matter
if
that
young
chap
were
not
living
with
the
rawnee
in
the
illegal
and
uncertificated
line
he
would
not
be
getting
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
fill
her
kettles
passing
on
i
proceeded
to
the
spring
where
i
filled
the
kettle
and
then
returned
to
the
dingle
placing
the
kettle
upon
the
fire
i
watched
it
till
it
began
to
boil
then
removing
it
from
the
top
of
the
brands
i
placed
it
close
beside
the
fire
and
leaving
it
simmering
i
retired
to
my
tent
where
having
taken
off
my
shoes
and
a
few
of
my
garments
i
lay
down
on
my
palliasse
and
was
not
long
in
falling
asleep
i
believe
i
slept
soundly
for
some
time
thinking
and
dreaming
of
nothing
suddenly
however
my
sleep
became
disturbed
and
the
subject
of
the
patterans
began
to
occupy
my
brain
i
imagined
that
i
saw
ursula
tracing
her
husband
launcelot
lovel
by
means
of
his
patterans
i
imagined
that
she
had
considerable
difficulty
in
doing
so
that
she
was
occasionally
interrupted
by
parish
beadles
and
constables
who
asked
her
whither
she
was
travelling
to
whom
she
gave
various
answers
presently
methought
that
as
she
was
passing
by
a
yard
two
fierce
and
savage
dogs
flew
at
her
i
was
in
great
trouble
i
remember
and
wished
to
assist
her
but
could
not
for
though
i
seemed
to
see
her
i
was
still
at
a
distance
and
now
it
appeared
that
she
had
escaped
from
the
dogs
and
was
proceeding
with
her
cart
along
a
gravelly
path
which
traversed
a
wild
moor
i
could
hear
the
wheels
grating
amidst
sand
and
gravel
the
next
moment
i
was
awake
and
found
myself
sitting
up
in
my
tent
there
was
a
glimmer
of
light
through
the
canvas
caused
by
the
fire
a
feeling
of
dread
came
over
me
which
was
perhaps
natural
on
starting
suddenly
from
one
sleep
in
that
wild
lone
place
i
half
imagined
that
some
one
was
nigh
the
tent
the
idea
made
me
rather
uncomfortable
and
to
dissipate
it
i
lifted
up
the
canvas
of
the
door
and
peeped
out
and
lo
i
had
a
distinct
view
of
a
tall
figure
standing
by
the
tent
who
is
that
said
i
whilst
i
felt
my
blood
rush
to
my
heart
it
is
i
said
the
voice
of
isopel
berners
you
little
expected
me
i
dare
say
well
sleep
on
i
do
not
wish
to
disturb
you
but
i
was
expecting
you
said
i
recovering
myself
as
you
may
see
by
the
fire
and
kettle
i
will
be
with
you
in
a
moment
putting
on
in
haste
the
articles
of
dress
which
i
had
flung
off
i
came
out
of
the
tent
and
addressing
myself
to
isopel
who
was
standing
beside
her
cart
i
said
just
as
i
was
about
to
retire
to
rest
i
thought
it
possible
that
you
might
come
and
got
everything
in
readiness
for
you
now
sit
down
by
the
fire
whilst
i
lead
the
donkey
and
cart
to
the
place
where
you
stay
i
will
unharness
the
animal
and
presently
come
and
join
you
i
need
not
trouble
you
said
isopel
i
will
go
myself
and
see
after
my
things
we
will
go
together
said
i
and
then
return
and
have
some
tea
isopel
made
no
objection
and
in
about
we
had
arranged
everything
at
her
quarters
i
then
hastened
and
prepared
tea
presently
isopel
rejoined
me
bringing
her
stool
she
had
divested
herself
of
her
bonnet
and
her
hair
fell
over
her
shoulders
she
sat
down
and
i
poured
out
the
beverage
handing
her
a
cup
have
you
made
a
long
journey
said
i
a
very
long
one
replied
belle
i
have
come
nearly
twenty
miles
since
six
i
believe
i
heard
you
coming
in
my
sleep
said
i
did
the
dogs
above
bark
at
you
yes
said
isopel
very
violently
did
you
think
of
me
in
your
sleep
no
said
i
i
was
thinking
of
ursula
and
something
she
had
told
me
when
and
where
was
that
said
isopel
yesterday
evening
said
i
beneath
the
dingle
hedge
then
you
were
talking
with
her
beneath
the
hedge
i
was
said
i
but
only
upon
gypsy
matters
do
you
know
belle
that
she
has
just
been
married
to
sylvester
so
that
you
need
not
think
that
she
and
i
she
and
you
are
quite
at
liberty
to
sit
where
you
please
said
isopel
however
young
man
she
continued
dropping
her
tone
which
she
had
slightly
raised
i
believe
what
you
said
that
you
were
merely
talking
about
gypsy
matters
and
also
what
you
were
going
to
say
if
it
was
as
i
suppose
that
she
and
you
had
no
particular
acquaintance
isopel
was
now
silent
for
some
time
what
are
you
thinking
of
said
i
i
was
thinking
said
belle
how
exceedingly
kind
it
was
of
you
to
get
everything
in
readiness
for
me
though
you
did
not
know
that
i
should
come
i
had
a
presentiment
that
you
would
come
said
i
but
you
forget
that
i
have
prepared
the
kettle
for
you
before
though
it
was
true
that
i
was
then
certain
that
you
would
come
i
had
not
forgotten
your
doing
so
young
man
said
belle
but
i
was
beginning
to
think
that
you
were
utterly
selfish
caring
for
nothing
but
the
gratification
of
your
own
selfish
whims
i
am
very
fond
of
having
my
own
way
said
i
but
utterly
selfish
i
am
not
as
i
dare
say
i
shall
frequently
prove
to
you
you
will
often
find
the
kettle
boiling
when
you
come
home
not
heated
by
you
said
isopel
with
a
sigh
by
whom
else
said
i
surely
you
are
not
thinking
of
driving
me
away
you
have
as
much
right
here
as
myself
said
isopel
as
i
have
told
you
before
but
i
must
be
going
myself
well
said
i
we
can
go
together
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
rather
tired
of
this
place
our
paths
must
be
separate
said
belle
separate
said
i
what
do
you
mean
i
sha
let
you
go
alone
i
shall
go
with
you
and
you
know
the
road
is
as
free
to
me
as
to
you
besides
you
ca
think
of
parting
company
with
me
considering
how
much
you
would
lose
by
doing
so
remember
that
you
know
scarcely
anything
of
the
armenian
language
now
to
learn
armenian
from
me
would
take
you
twenty
years
belle
faintly
smiled
come
said
i
take
another
cup
of
tea
belle
took
another
cup
of
tea
and
yet
another
we
had
some
indifferent
conversation
after
which
i
arose
and
gave
her
donkey
a
considerable
feed
of
corn
belle
thanked
me
shook
me
by
the
hand
and
then
went
to
her
own
tabernacle
and
i
returned
to
mine
chapter
xiii
visit
to
the
landlord
his
mortifications
hunter
and
his
clan
resolution
on
the
following
morning
after
breakfasting
with
belle
who
was
silent
and
melancholy
i
left
her
in
the
dingle
and
took
a
stroll
amongst
the
neighbouring
lanes
after
some
time
i
thought
i
would
pay
a
visit
to
the
landlord
of
the
whom
i
had
not
seen
since
the
day
when
he
communicated
to
me
his
intention
of
changing
his
religion
i
therefore
directed
my
steps
to
the
house
and
on
entering
it
found
the
landlord
standing
in
the
kitchen
just
then
two
fellows
who
had
been
drinking
at
one
of
the
tables
and
who
appeared
to
be
the
only
customers
in
the
house
got
up
brushed
past
the
landlord
and
saying
in
a
surly
tone
we
shall
pay
you
some
time
or
other
took
their
departure
that
the
way
they
serve
me
now
said
the
landlord
with
a
sigh
do
you
know
those
fellows
i
demanded
since
you
let
them
go
away
in
your
debt
i
know
nothing
about
them
said
the
landlord
save
that
they
are
a
couple
of
scamps
then
why
did
you
let
them
go
away
without
paying
you
said
i
i
had
not
the
heart
to
stop
them
said
the
landlord
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
everybody
serves
me
so
now
and
i
suppose
they
are
right
for
a
child
could
flog
me
nonsense
said
i
behave
more
like
a
man
and
with
respect
to
those
two
fellows
run
after
them
i
will
go
with
you
and
if
they
refuse
to
pay
the
reckoning
i
will
help
you
to
shake
some
money
out
of
their
clothes
thank
you
said
the
landlord
but
as
they
are
gone
let
them
go
on
what
they
have
drank
is
not
of
much
consequence
what
is
the
matter
with
you
said
i
staring
at
the
landlord
who
appeared
strangely
altered
his
features
were
wild
and
haggard
his
formerly
bluff
cheeks
were
considerably
sunken
in
and
his
figure
had
lost
much
of
its
plumpness
have
you
changed
your
religion
already
and
has
the
fellow
in
black
commanded
you
to
fast
i
have
not
changed
my
religion
yet
said
the
landlord
with
a
kind
of
shudder
i
am
to
change
it
publicly
this
day
fortnight
and
the
idea
of
doing
so
i
do
not
mind
telling
you
preys
much
upon
my
mind
moreover
the
noise
of
the
thing
has
got
abroad
and
everybody
is
laughing
at
me
and
what
more
coming
and
drinking
my
beer
and
going
away
without
paying
for
it
whilst
i
feel
myself
like
one
bewitched
wishing
but
not
daring
to
take
my
own
part
confound
the
fellow
in
black
i
wish
i
had
never
seen
him
yet
what
can
i
do
without
him
the
brewer
swears
that
unless
i
pay
him
fifty
pounds
within
a
fortnight
send
a
distress
warrant
into
the
house
and
take
all
i
have
my
poor
niece
is
crying
in
the
room
above
and
i
am
thinking
of
going
into
the
stable
and
hanging
myself
and
perhaps
it
the
best
thing
i
can
do
for
it
better
to
hang
myself
before
selling
my
soul
than
afterwards
as
sure
i
should
like
judas
iscariot
whom
my
poor
niece
who
is
somewhat
religiously
inclined
has
been
talking
to
me
about
i
wish
i
could
assist
you
said
i
with
money
but
that
is
quite
out
of
my
power
however
i
can
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
do
change
your
religion
by
any
means
you
ca
hope
to
prosper
if
you
do
and
if
the
brewer
chooses
to
deal
hardly
with
you
let
him
everybody
would
respect
you
ten
times
more
provided
you
allowed
yourself
to
be
turned
into
the
roads
rather
than
change
your
religion
than
if
you
got
fifty
pounds
for
renouncing
it
i
am
half
inclined
to
take
your
advice
said
the
landlord
only
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
feel
quite
low
without
any
heart
in
me
come
into
the
bar
said
i
and
let
us
have
something
together
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
my
not
paying
for
what
i
order
we
went
into
the
where
the
landlord
and
i
discussed
between
us
two
bottles
of
strong
ale
which
he
said
were
part
of
the
last
six
which
he
had
in
his
possession
at
first
he
wished
to
drink
sherry
but
i
begged
him
to
do
no
such
thing
telling
him
that
sherry
would
do
him
no
good
under
the
present
circumstances
nor
indeed
to
the
best
of
my
belief
under
any
it
being
of
all
wines
the
one
for
which
i
entertained
the
most
contempt
the
landlord
allowed
himself
to
be
dissuaded
and
after
a
glass
or
two
of
ale
confessed
that
sherry
was
a
sickly
disagreeable
drink
and
that
he
had
merely
been
in
the
habit
of
taking
it
from
an
idea
he
had
that
it
was
genteel
whilst
quaffing
our
beverage
he
gave
me
an
account
of
the
various
mortifications
to
which
he
had
of
late
been
subject
dwelling
with
particular
bitterness
on
the
conduct
of
hunter
who
he
said
came
every
night
and
mouthed
him
and
afterwards
went
away
without
paying
for
what
he
had
drank
or
smoked
in
which
conduct
he
was
closely
imitated
by
a
clan
of
fellows
who
constantly
attended
him
after
spending
several
hours
at
the
i
departed
not
forgetting
to
pay
for
the
two
bottles
of
ale
the
landlord
before
i
went
shaking
me
by
the
hand
declared
that
he
had
now
made
up
his
mind
to
stick
to
his
religion
at
all
hazards
the
more
especially
as
he
was
convinced
he
should
derive
no
good
by
giving
it
up
chapter
xiv
preparations
for
the
fair
the
last
lesson
the
verb
siriel
it
might
be
about
five
in
the
evening
when
i
reached
the
gypsy
encampment
here
i
found
petulengro
tawno
chikno
sylvester
and
others
in
a
great
bustle
clipping
and
trimming
certain
ponies
and
old
horses
which
they
had
brought
with
them
on
inquiring
of
jasper
the
reason
of
their
being
so
engaged
he
informed
me
that
they
were
getting
the
horses
ready
for
a
fair
which
was
to
be
held
on
the
morrow
at
a
place
some
miles
distant
at
which
they
should
endeavour
to
dispose
of
them
adding
perhaps
brother
you
will
go
with
us
provided
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
not
having
any
particular
engagement
i
assured
him
that
i
should
have
great
pleasure
in
being
of
the
party
it
was
agreed
that
we
should
start
early
on
the
following
morning
thereupon
i
descended
into
the
dingle
belle
was
sitting
before
the
fire
at
which
the
kettle
was
boiling
were
you
waiting
for
me
i
inquired
yes
said
belle
i
thought
that
you
would
come
and
i
waited
for
you
that
was
very
kind
said
i
not
half
so
kind
said
she
as
it
was
of
you
to
get
everything
ready
for
me
in
the
dead
of
last
night
when
there
was
scarcely
a
chance
of
my
coming
the
were
brought
forward
and
we
sat
down
have
you
been
far
said
belle
merely
to
that
said
i
to
which
you
directed
me
on
the
second
day
of
our
acquaintance
young
men
should
not
make
a
habit
of
visiting
houses
said
belle
they
are
bad
places
they
may
be
so
to
some
people
said
i
but
i
do
not
think
the
worst
in
england
could
do
me
any
harm
perhaps
you
are
so
bad
already
said
belle
with
a
smile
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
spoil
you
how
dare
you
catch
at
my
words
said
i
come
i
will
make
you
pay
for
doing
so
you
shall
have
this
evening
the
longest
lesson
in
armenian
which
i
have
yet
inflicted
upon
you
you
may
well
say
inflicted
said
belle
but
pray
spare
me
i
do
not
wish
to
hear
anything
about
armenian
especially
this
evening
why
this
evening
said
belle
made
no
answer
i
will
not
spare
you
said
i
this
evening
i
intend
to
make
you
conjugate
an
armenian
verb
well
be
it
so
said
belle
for
this
evening
you
shall
command
to
command
is
hramahyel
said
i
ram
her
ill
indeed
said
belle
i
do
not
wish
to
begin
with
that
no
said
i
as
we
have
come
to
the
verbs
we
will
begin
regularly
hramahyel
is
a
verb
of
the
second
conjugation
we
will
begin
with
the
first
first
of
all
tell
me
said
belle
what
a
verb
is
a
part
of
speech
said
i
which
according
to
the
dictionary
signifies
some
action
or
passion
for
example
i
command
you
or
i
hate
you
i
have
given
you
no
cause
to
hate
me
said
belle
looking
me
sorrowfully
in
the
face
i
was
merely
giving
two
examples
said
i
and
neither
was
directed
at
you
in
those
examples
to
command
and
hate
are
verbs
belle
in
armenian
there
are
four
conjugations
of
verbs
the
first
ends
in
al
the
second
in
yel
the
third
in
oul
and
the
fourth
in
il
now
have
you
understood
me
i
am
afraid
indeed
it
will
all
end
ill
said
belle
hold
your
tongue
said
i
or
you
will
make
me
lose
my
patience
you
have
already
made
me
nearly
lose
mine
said
belle
let
us
have
no
unprofitable
interruptions
said
i
the
conjugations
of
the
armenian
verbs
are
neither
so
numerous
nor
so
difficult
as
the
declensions
of
the
nouns
hear
that
and
rejoice
come
we
will
begin
with
the
verb
hntal
a
verb
of
the
first
conjugation
which
signifies
to
rejoice
come
along
hntam
i
rejoice
hntas
thou
rejoicest
why
do
you
follow
belle
i
am
sure
i
do
rejoice
whatever
you
may
do
said
belle
the
chief
difficulty
belle
said
i
that
i
find
in
teaching
you
the
armenian
grammar
proceeds
from
your
applying
to
yourself
and
me
every
example
i
give
rejoice
in
this
instance
is
merely
an
example
of
an
armenian
verb
of
the
first
conjugation
and
has
no
more
to
do
with
your
rejoicing
than
lal
which
is
also
a
verb
of
the
first
conjugation
and
which
signifies
to
weep
would
have
to
do
with
your
weeping
provided
i
made
you
conjugate
it
come
along
hntam
i
rejoice
hntas
thou
rejoicest
hnta
he
rejoices
hntamk
we
rejoice
now
repeat
those
words
i
ca
said
belle
they
sound
more
like
the
language
of
horses
than
human
beings
do
you
take
me
for
for
what
said
belle
was
silent
were
you
going
to
say
mare
said
i
mare
mare
by
the
bye
do
you
know
belle
that
mare
in
old
english
stands
for
woman
and
that
when
we
call
a
female
an
evil
mare
the
strict
meaning
of
the
term
is
merely
a
bad
woman
so
if
i
were
to
call
you
a
mare
without
prefixing
bad
you
must
not
be
offended
but
i
should
though
said
belle
i
was
merely
attempting
to
make
you
acquainted
with
a
philological
fact
said
i
if
mare
which
in
old
english
and
likewise
in
vulgar
english
signifies
a
woman
sounds
the
same
as
mare
which
in
modern
and
polite
english
signifies
a
female
horse
i
ca
help
it
there
is
no
such
confusion
of
sounds
in
armenian
not
at
least
in
the
same
instance
belle
in
armenian
woman
is
ghin
the
same
word
by
the
by
as
our
queen
whereas
mare
is
madagh
tzi
which
signifies
a
female
horse
and
perhaps
you
will
permit
me
to
add
that
a
jade
is
in
armenian
madagh
tzi
hsdierah
i
ca
bear
this
much
longer
said
belle
keep
yourself
quiet
said
i
i
wish
to
be
gentle
with
you
and
to
convince
you
we
will
skip
hntal
and
also
for
the
present
verbs
of
the
first
conjugation
and
proceed
to
the
second
belle
i
will
now
select
for
you
to
conjugate
the
prettiest
verb
in
armenian
not
only
of
the
second
but
also
of
all
the
four
conjugations
that
verb
is
siriel
here
is
the
present
tense
siriem
siries
sire
siriemk
sirek
sirien
you
observe
that
it
runs
on
just
in
the
same
manner
as
hntal
save
and
except
that
the
e
is
substituted
for
a
and
it
will
be
as
well
to
tell
you
that
almost
the
only
difference
between
the
second
third
and
fourth
conjugation
and
the
first
is
the
substituting
in
the
present
preterite
and
other
tenses
e
or
ou
or
i
for
a
so
you
see
that
the
armenian
verbs
are
by
no
means
difficult
come
on
belle
and
say
siriem
belle
hesitated
pray
oblige
me
belle
by
saying
siriem
belle
still
appeared
to
hesitate
you
must
admit
belle
that
it
is
much
softer
than
hntam
it
is
so
said
belle
and
to
oblige
you
i
will
say
siriem
very
well
indeed
belle
said
i
no
vartabied
or
doctor
could
have
pronounced
it
better
and
now
to
show
you
how
verbs
act
upon
pronouns
in
armenian
i
will
say
siriem
zkiez
please
to
repeat
siriem
zkiez
siriem
zkiez
said
belle
that
last
word
is
very
hard
to
say
sorry
that
you
think
so
belle
said
i
now
please
to
say
siria
zis
belle
did
so
exceedingly
well
said
i
now
say
yerani
the
sireir
zis
yerani
the
sireir
zis
said
belle
capital
said
i
you
have
now
said
i
love
you
love
me
ah
would
that
you
would
love
me
and
i
have
said
all
these
things
said
belle
yes
said
i
you
have
said
them
in
armenian
i
would
have
said
them
in
no
language
that
i
understood
said
belle
and
it
was
very
wrong
of
you
to
take
advantage
of
my
ignorance
and
make
me
say
such
things
why
so
said
i
if
you
said
them
i
said
them
too
you
did
so
said
belle
but
i
believe
you
were
merely
bantering
and
jeering
as
i
told
you
before
belle
said
i
the
chief
difficulty
which
i
find
in
teaching
you
armenian
proceeds
from
your
persisting
in
applying
to
yourself
and
me
every
example
i
give
then
you
meant
nothing
after
all
said
belle
raising
her
voice
let
us
proceed
said
i
sirietsi
i
loved
you
never
loved
any
one
but
yourself
said
belle
and
what
more
sirietsits
i
will
love
said
i
sirietsies
thou
wilt
love
never
one
so
thoroughly
heartless
said
belle
i
tell
you
what
belle
you
are
becoming
intolerable
but
we
will
change
the
verb
or
rather
i
will
now
proceed
to
tell
you
here
that
some
of
the
armenian
conjugations
have
their
anomalies
one
species
of
these
i
wish
to
bring
before
your
notice
as
old
villotte
says
from
whose
work
i
first
contrived
to
pick
up
the
rudiments
of
armenian
verborum
transitivorum
quorum
infinitivus
but
i
forgot
you
do
understand
latin
he
says
there
are
certain
transitive
verbs
whose
infinitive
is
in
outsaniel
the
preterite
in
outsi
the
imperative
in
one
for
example
i
irritate
you
do
you
do
said
belle
and
it
will
be
better
for
both
of
us
if
you
leave
off
doing
so
you
would
hardly
believe
belle
said
i
that
the
armenian
is
in
some
respects
closely
connected
with
the
irish
but
so
it
is
for
example
that
word
is
evidently
derived
from
the
same
root
as
feargaim
which
in
irish
is
as
much
as
to
say
i
vex
you
do
indeed
said
belle
sobbing
but
how
do
you
account
for
it
o
man
man
said
belle
bursting
into
tears
for
what
purpose
do
you
ask
a
poor
ignorant
girl
such
a
question
unless
it
be
to
vex
and
irritate
her
if
you
wish
to
display
your
learning
do
so
to
the
wise
and
instructed
and
not
to
me
who
can
scarcely
read
or
write
oh
leave
off
your
nonsense
yet
i
know
you
will
not
do
so
for
it
is
the
breath
of
your
nostrils
i
could
have
wished
we
should
have
parted
in
kindness
but
you
will
not
permit
it
i
have
deserved
better
at
your
hands
than
such
treatment
the
whole
time
we
have
kept
company
together
in
this
place
i
have
scarcely
had
one
kind
word
from
you
but
the
strangest
and
here
the
voice
of
belle
was
drowned
in
her
sobs
i
am
sorry
to
see
you
take
on
so
dear
belle
said
i
i
really
have
given
you
no
cause
to
be
so
unhappy
surely
teaching
you
a
little
armenian
was
a
very
innocent
kind
of
diversion
yes
but
you
went
on
so
long
and
in
such
a
strange
way
and
made
me
repeat
such
strange
examples
as
you
call
them
that
i
could
not
bear
it
why
to
tell
you
the
truth
belle
it
just
my
way
and
i
have
dealt
with
you
just
as
i
would
with
a
jade
said
belle
and
you
practising
your
upon
her
i
have
been
of
an
unsubdued
spirit
i
acknowledge
but
i
was
always
kind
to
you
and
if
you
have
made
me
cry
it
a
poor
thing
to
boast
of
boast
of
said
i
a
pretty
thing
indeed
to
boast
of
i
had
no
idea
of
making
you
cry
come
i
beg
your
pardon
what
more
can
i
do
come
cheer
up
belle
you
were
talking
of
parting
do
let
us
part
but
depart
and
that
together
our
ways
lie
different
said
belle
i
do
see
why
they
should
said
i
come
let
us
be
off
to
america
together
to
america
together
said
belle
looking
full
at
me
yes
said
i
where
we
will
settle
down
in
some
forest
and
conjugate
the
verb
siriel
conjugally
conjugally
said
belle
yes
said
i
as
man
and
wife
in
america
air
yew
ghin
you
are
jesting
as
usual
said
belle
not
i
indeed
come
belle
make
up
your
mind
and
let
us
be
off
to
america
and
leave
priests
humbug
learning
and
languages
behind
us
i
do
think
you
are
jesting
said
belle
but
i
can
hardly
entertain
your
offers
however
young
man
i
thank
you
you
had
better
make
up
your
mind
at
once
said
i
and
let
us
be
off
i
sha
make
a
bad
husband
i
assure
you
perhaps
you
think
i
am
not
worthy
of
you
to
convince
you
belle
that
i
am
i
am
ready
to
try
a
fall
with
you
this
moment
upon
the
grass
brynhilda
the
valkyrie
swore
that
no
one
should
ever
marry
her
who
could
not
fling
her
down
perhaps
you
have
done
the
same
the
man
who
eventually
married
her
got
a
friend
of
his
who
was
called
sygurd
the
to
wrestle
with
her
disguising
him
in
his
own
armour
sygurd
flung
her
down
and
won
her
for
his
friend
though
he
loved
her
himself
i
shall
not
use
a
similar
deceit
nor
employ
jasper
petulengro
to
personate
me
so
get
up
belle
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
fling
you
down
i
require
no
such
thing
of
you
or
anybody
said
belle
you
are
beginning
to
look
rather
wild
i
every
now
and
then
do
said
i
come
belle
what
do
you
say
i
will
say
nothing
at
present
on
the
subject
said
belle
i
must
have
time
to
consider
just
as
you
please
said
i
i
go
to
a
fair
with
petulengro
perhaps
you
will
consider
whilst
i
am
away
come
belle
let
us
have
some
more
tea
i
wonder
whether
we
shall
be
able
to
procure
tea
as
good
as
this
in
the
american
forest
chapter
xv
the
dawn
of
day
the
last
farewell
departure
for
the
fair
the
fine
horse
return
to
the
dingle
no
isopel
it
was
about
the
dawn
of
day
when
i
was
awakened
by
the
voice
of
petulengro
shouting
from
the
top
of
the
dingle
and
bidding
me
get
up
i
arose
instantly
and
dressed
myself
for
the
expedition
to
the
fair
on
leaving
my
tent
i
was
surprised
to
observe
belle
entirely
dressed
standing
close
to
her
own
little
encampment
dear
me
said
i
i
little
expected
to
find
you
up
so
early
i
suppose
jasper
call
awakened
you
as
it
did
me
i
merely
lay
down
in
my
things
said
belle
and
have
not
slept
during
the
night
and
why
did
you
not
take
off
your
things
and
go
to
sleep
said
i
i
did
not
undress
said
belle
because
i
wished
to
be
in
readiness
to
bid
you
farewell
when
you
departed
and
as
for
sleeping
i
could
not
well
god
bless
you
said
i
taking
belle
by
the
hand
belle
made
no
answer
and
i
observed
that
her
hand
was
very
cold
what
is
the
matter
with
you
said
i
looking
her
in
the
face
belle
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
in
the
eyes
and
then
cast
down
her
own
her
features
were
very
pale
you
are
really
unwell
said
i
i
had
better
not
go
to
the
fair
but
stay
here
and
take
care
of
you
no
said
belle
pray
go
i
am
not
unwell
then
go
to
your
tent
said
i
and
do
not
endanger
your
health
by
standing
abroad
in
the
raw
morning
air
god
bless
you
belle
i
shall
be
home
by
which
time
i
expect
you
will
have
made
up
your
mind
if
not
another
lesson
in
armenian
however
late
the
hour
be
i
then
wrung
hand
and
ascended
to
the
plain
above
i
found
the
romany
party
waiting
for
me
and
everything
in
readiness
for
departing
petulengro
and
tawno
chikno
were
mounted
on
two
old
horses
the
rest
who
intended
to
go
to
the
fair
amongst
whom
were
two
or
three
women
were
on
foot
on
arriving
at
the
extremity
of
the
plain
i
looked
towards
the
dingle
isopel
berners
stood
at
the
mouth
the
beams
of
the
early
morning
sun
shone
full
on
her
noble
face
and
figure
i
waved
my
hand
towards
her
she
slowly
lifted
up
her
right
arm
i
turned
away
and
never
saw
isopel
berners
again
my
companions
and
myself
proceeded
on
our
way
in
about
two
hours
we
reached
the
place
where
the
fair
was
to
be
held
after
breakfasting
on
bread
and
cheese
and
ale
behind
a
broken
stone
wall
we
drove
our
animals
to
the
fair
the
fair
was
a
common
cattle
and
horse
fair
there
was
little
merriment
going
on
but
there
was
no
lack
of
business
by
about
two
in
the
afternoon
petulengro
and
his
people
had
disposed
of
their
animals
at
what
they
conceived
very
fair
prices
they
were
all
in
high
spirits
and
jasper
proposed
to
adjourn
to
a
as
we
were
proceeding
to
one
a
very
fine
horse
led
by
a
jockey
made
its
appearance
on
the
ground
petulengro
stopped
short
and
looked
at
it
stedfastly
fino
covar
dove
odoy
sas
miro
a
fine
thing
were
that
if
it
were
but
mine
he
exclaimed
if
you
covet
it
said
i
why
do
you
not
purchase
it
we
low
never
buy
animals
of
that
description
if
we
did
we
could
never
sell
them
and
most
likely
should
be
had
up
as
then
why
did
you
say
just
now
were
a
fine
thing
if
it
were
but
yours
said
i
we
always
say
so
when
we
see
anything
that
we
admire
an
animal
like
that
is
not
intended
for
a
little
hare
like
me
but
for
some
grand
gentleman
like
yourself
i
say
brother
do
you
buy
that
horse
how
should
i
buy
the
horse
you
foolish
person
said
i
buy
the
horse
brother
said
petulengro
if
you
have
not
the
money
i
can
lend
it
you
though
i
be
of
lower
egypt
you
talk
nonsense
said
i
however
i
wish
you
would
ask
the
man
the
price
of
it
petulengro
going
up
to
the
jockey
inquired
the
price
of
the
horse
the
man
looking
at
him
scornfully
made
no
reply
young
man
said
i
going
up
to
the
jockey
do
me
the
favour
to
tell
me
the
price
of
that
horse
as
i
suppose
it
is
to
sell
the
jockey
who
was
a
man
of
about
fifty
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
then
after
some
hesitation
said
laconically
seventy
thank
you
said
i
and
turned
away
buy
that
horse
said
petulengro
coming
after
me
the
dook
tells
me
that
in
less
than
three
months
he
will
be
sold
for
twice
seventy
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
said
i
besides
jasper
i
do
like
his
tail
did
you
observe
what
a
mean
scrubby
tail
he
has
what
a
fool
you
are
brother
said
petulengro
that
very
tail
of
his
shows
his
breeding
no
good
bred
horse
ever
yet
carried
a
fine
tail
is
your
horses
that
are
your
did
you
ever
hear
of
syntax
brother
that
tail
of
his
puts
me
in
mind
of
syntax
well
i
say
nothing
more
have
your
own
way
all
i
wonder
at
is
that
a
horse
like
him
was
ever
brought
to
such
a
fair
of
dog
cattle
as
this
we
then
made
the
best
of
our
way
to
a
where
we
had
some
refreshment
i
then
proposed
returning
to
the
encampment
but
petulengro
declined
and
remained
drinking
with
his
companions
till
about
six
in
the
evening
when
various
jockeys
from
the
fair
came
in
after
some
conversation
a
jockey
proposed
a
game
of
cards
and
in
a
little
time
petulengro
and
another
gypsy
sat
down
to
play
a
game
of
cards
with
two
of
the
jockeys
though
not
much
acquainted
with
cards
i
soon
conceived
a
suspicion
that
the
jockeys
were
cheating
petulengro
and
his
companion
i
therefore
called
petulengro
aside
and
gave
him
a
hint
to
that
effect
petulengro
however
instead
of
thanking
me
told
me
to
mind
my
own
bread
and
butter
and
forthwith
returned
to
his
game
i
continued
watching
the
players
for
some
hours
the
gypsies
lost
considerably
and
i
saw
clearly
that
the
jockeys
were
cheating
them
most
confoundedly
i
therefore
once
more
called
petulengro
aside
and
told
him
that
the
jockeys
were
cheating
him
conjuring
him
to
return
to
the
encampment
petulengro
who
was
by
this
time
somewhat
the
worse
for
liquor
now
fell
into
a
passion
swore
several
oaths
and
asking
me
who
had
made
me
a
moses
over
him
and
his
brethren
told
me
to
return
to
the
encampment
by
myself
incensed
at
the
unworthy
return
which
my
words
had
received
i
forthwith
left
the
house
and
having
purchased
a
few
articles
of
provision
i
set
out
for
the
dingle
alone
it
was
a
dark
night
when
i
reached
it
and
descending
i
saw
the
glimmer
of
a
fire
from
the
depths
of
the
dingle
my
heart
beat
with
fond
anticipation
of
a
welcome
isopel
berners
is
waiting
for
me
said
i
and
the
first
words
that
i
shall
hear
from
her
lips
is
that
she
has
made
up
her
mind
we
shall
go
to
america
and
be
so
happy
together
on
reaching
the
bottom
of
the
dingle
however
i
saw
seated
near
the
fire
beside
which
stood
the
kettle
simmering
not
isopel
berners
but
a
gypsy
girl
who
told
me
that
miss
berners
when
she
went
away
had
charged
her
to
keep
up
the
fire
and
have
the
kettle
boiling
against
my
arrival
startled
at
these
words
i
inquired
at
what
hour
isopel
had
left
and
whither
she
was
gone
and
was
told
that
she
had
left
the
dingle
with
her
cart
about
two
hours
after
i
departed
but
where
she
was
gone
she
the
girl
did
not
know
i
then
asked
whether
she
had
left
no
message
and
the
girl
replied
that
she
had
left
none
but
had
merely
given
directions
about
the
kettle
and
fire
putting
at
the
same
time
into
her
hand
very
strange
thought
i
then
dismissing
the
gypsy
girl
i
sat
down
by
the
fire
i
had
no
wish
for
tea
but
sat
looking
on
the
embers
wondering
what
could
be
the
motive
of
the
sudden
departure
of
isopel
does
she
mean
to
return
thought
i
to
myself
surely
she
means
to
return
hope
replied
or
she
would
not
have
gone
away
without
leaving
any
message
and
yet
she
could
scarcely
mean
to
return
muttered
foreboding
or
she
assuredly
would
have
left
some
message
with
the
girl
i
then
thought
to
myself
what
a
hard
thing
it
would
be
if
after
having
made
up
my
mind
to
assume
the
yoke
of
matrimony
i
should
be
disappointed
of
the
woman
of
my
choice
well
after
all
thought
i
i
can
scarcely
be
disappointed
if
such
an
ugly
scoundrel
as
sylvester
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
such
a
nice
wife
as
ursula
surely
i
who
am
not
a
tenth
part
so
ugly
can
not
fail
to
obtain
the
hand
of
isopel
berners
uncommonly
fine
damsel
though
she
be
husbands
do
not
grow
upon
hedgerows
she
is
merely
gone
after
a
little
business
and
will
return
comforted
in
some
degree
by
these
hopeful
imaginings
i
retired
to
my
tent
and
went
to
sleep

the

letter
bears
and
barons
the
best
of
advice
nothing
occurred
to
me
of
any
particular
moment
during
the
following
day
isopel
berners
did
not
return
but
petulengro
and
his
companions
came
home
from
the
fair
early
in
the
morning
when
i
saw
him
which
was
about
midday
i
found
him
with
his
face
bruised
and
swelled
it
appeared
that
some
time
after
i
had
left
him
he
himself
perceived
that
the
jockeys
with
whom
he
was
playing
cards
were
cheating
him
and
his
companion
a
quarrel
ensued
which
terminated
in
a
fight
between
petulengro
and
one
of
the
jockeys
which
lasted
some
time
and
in
which
petulengro
though
he
eventually
came
off
victor
was
considerably
beaten
his
bruises
in
conjunction
with
his
pecuniary
loss
which
amounted
to
about
seven
pounds
were
the
cause
of
his
being
much
out
of
humour
before
night
however
he
had
returned
to
his
usual
philosophic
frame
of
mind
and
coming
up
to
me
as
i
was
walking
about
apologized
for
his
behaviour
on
the
preceding
day
and
assured
me
that
he
was
determined
from
that
time
forward
never
to
quarrel
with
a
friend
for
giving
him
good
advice
two
more
days
passed
and
still
isopel
berners
did
not
return
gloomy
thoughts
and
forebodings
filled
my
mind
during
the
day
i
wandered
about
the
neighbouring
roads
in
the
hopes
of
catching
an
early
glimpse
of
her
and
her
returning
vehicle
and
at
night
lay
awake
tossing
about
on
my
hard
couch
listening
to
the
rustle
of
every
leaf
and
occasionally
thinking
that
i
heard
the
sound
of
her
wheels
upon
the
distant
road
once
at
midnight
just
as
i
was
about
to
fall
into
unconsciousness
i
suddenly
started
up
for
i
was
convinced
that
i
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
i
listened
most
anxiously
and
the
sound
of
wheels
striking
against
stones
was
certainly
plain
enough
she
comes
at
last
thought
i
and
for
a
few
moments
i
felt
as
if
a
mountain
had
been
removed
from
my
breast
here
she
comes
at
last
now
how
shall
i
receive
her
oh
thought
i
i
will
receive
her
rather
coolly
just
as
if
i
was
not
particularly
anxious
about
her
that
the
way
to
manage
these
women
the
next
moment
the
sound
became
very
loud
rather
too
loud
i
thought
to
proceed
from
her
wheels
and
then
by
degrees
became
fainter
rushing
out
of
my
tent
i
hurried
up
the
path
to
the
top
of
the
dingle
where
i
heard
the
sound
distinctly
enough
but
it
was
going
from
me
and
evidently
proceeded
from
something
much
larger
than
the
cart
of
isopel
i
could
moreover
hear
the
stamping
of
a
horse
hoof
at
a
lumbering
trot
those
only
whose
hopes
have
been
wrought
up
to
a
high
pitch
and
then
suddenly
cast
down
can
imagine
what
i
felt
at
that
moment
and
yet
when
i
returned
to
my
lonely
tent
and
lay
down
on
my
hard
pallet
the
voice
of
conscience
told
me
that
the
misery
i
was
then
undergoing
i
had
fully
merited
for
the
unkind
manner
in
which
i
had
intended
to
receive
her
when
for
a
brief
moment
i
supposed
that
she
had
returned
it
was
on
the
morning
after
this
affair
and
the
fourth
if
i
forget
not
from
the
time
of
isopel
departure
that
as
i
was
seated
on
my
stone
at
the
bottom
of
the
dingle
getting
my
breakfast
i
heard
an
unknown
voice
from
the
path
above
apparently
that
of
a
person
descending
exclaim
here
a
strange
place
to
bring
a
letter
to
and
presently
an
old
woman
with
a
belt
round
her
middle
to
which
was
attached
a
leathern
bag
made
her
appearance
and
stood
before
me
well
if
i
ever
said
she
as
she
looked
about
her
my
good
gentlewoman
said
i
pray
what
may
you
please
to
want
gentlewoman
said
the
old
dame
please
to
want
well
i
call
that
speaking
civilly
at
any
rate
it
is
true
civil
words
cost
nothing
nevertheless
we
do
not
always
get
them
what
i
please
to
want
is
to
deliver
a
letter
to
a
young
man
in
this
place
perhaps
you
be
he
what
the
name
on
the
letter
said
i
getting
up
and
going
to
her
there
no
name
upon
it
said
she
taking
a
letter
out
of
her
scrip
and
looking
at
it
it
is
directed
to
the
young
man
in
mumper
dingle
then
it
is
for
me
i
make
no
doubt
said
i
stretching
out
my
hand
to
take
it
please
to
pay
me
ninepence
first
said
the
old
woman
however
said
she
after
a
moment
thought
civility
is
civility
and
being
rather
a
scarce
article
should
meet
with
some
return
here
the
letter
young
man
and
i
hope
you
will
pay
for
it
for
if
you
do
not
i
must
pay
the
postage
myself
you
are
the
postwoman
i
suppose
said
i
as
i
took
the
letter
i
am
the
postman
mother
said
the
old
woman
but
as
he
has
a
wide
beat
i
help
him
as
much
as
i
can
and
i
generally
carry
letters
to
places
like
this
to
which
he
is
afraid
to
come
himself
you
say
the
postage
is
ninepence
said
i
here
a
shilling
well
i
call
that
honourable
said
the
old
woman
taking
the
shilling
and
putting
it
into
her
pocket
here
your
change
young
man
said
she
offering
me
threepence
pray
keep
that
for
yourself
said
i
you
deserve
it
for
your
trouble
well
i
call
that
genteel
said
the
old
woman
and
as
one
good
turn
deserves
another
since
you
look
as
if
you
could
read
i
will
read
your
letter
for
you
let
see
it
it
from
some
young
woman
or
other
i
dare
say
thank
you
said
i
but
i
can
read
all
the
better
for
you
said
the
old
woman
your
being
able
to
read
will
frequently
save
you
a
penny
for
that
the
charge
i
generally
make
for
reading
letters
though
as
you
behaved
so
genteelly
to
me
i
should
have
charged
you
nothing
well
if
you
can
read
why
do
you
open
the
letter
instead
of
keeping
it
hanging
between
your
finger
and
thumb
i
am
in
no
hurry
to
open
it
said
i
with
a
sigh
the
old
woman
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
well
young
man
said
she
there
are
some
especially
those
who
can
read
who
do
like
to
open
their
letters
when
anybody
is
by
more
especially
when
they
come
from
young
women
well
i
intrude
upon
you
but
leave
you
alone
with
your
letter
i
wish
it
may
contain
something
pleasant
god
bless
you
and
with
these
words
she
departed
i
sat
down
on
my
stone
with
my
letter
in
my
hand
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
it
could
have
come
from
no
other
person
than
isopel
berners
but
what
did
the
letter
contain
i
guessed
tolerably
well
what
its
purport
was
an
eternal
farewell
yet
i
was
afraid
to
open
the
letter
lest
my
expectation
should
be
confirmed
there
i
sat
with
the
letter
putting
off
the
evil
moment
as
long
as
possible
at
length
i
glanced
at
the
direction
which
was
written
in
a
fine
bold
hand
and
was
directed
as
the
old
woman
had
said
to
the
young
man
in
mumpers
dingle
with
the
addition
near
in
the
county
of
suddenly
the
idea
occurred
to
me
that
after
all
the
letter
might
not
contain
an
eternal
farewell
and
that
isopel
might
have
written
requesting
me
to
join
her
could
it
be
so
alas
no
presently
said
foreboding
at
last
i
became
ashamed
of
my
weakness
the
letter
must
be
opened
sooner
or
later
why
not
at
once
so
as
the
bather
who
for
a
considerable
time
has
stood
shivering
on
the
bank
afraid
to
take
the
decisive
plunge
suddenly
takes
it
i
tore
open
the
letter
almost
before
i
was
aware
i
had
no
sooner
done
so
than
a
paper
fell
out
i
examined
it
it
contained
a
lock
of
bright
flaxen
hair
this
is
no
good
sign
said
i
as
i
thrust
the
lock
and
paper
into
my
bosom
and
proceeded
to
read
the
letter
which
ran
as
follows
to
the
young
man
in
mumpers
dingle
sir
i
send
these
lines
with
the
hope
and
trust
that
they
will
find
you
well
even
as
i
am
myself
at
this
moment
and
in
much
better
spirits
for
my
own
are
not
such
as
i
could
wish
they
were
being
sometimes
rather
hysterical
and
vapourish
and
at
other
times
and
most
often
very
low
i
am
at
a
and
am
just
going
on
shipboard
and
when
you
get
these
i
shall
be
on
the
salt
waters
on
my
way
to
a
distant
country
and
leaving
my
own
behind
me
which
i
do
not
expect
ever
to
see
again
and
now
young
man
i
will
in
the
first
place
say
something
about
the
manner
in
which
i
quitted
you
it
must
have
seemed
somewhat
singular
to
you
that
i
went
away
without
taking
any
leave
or
giving
you
the
slightest
hint
that
i
was
going
but
i
did
not
do
so
without
considerable
reflection
i
was
afraid
that
i
should
not
be
able
to
support
a
and
as
you
had
said
that
you
were
determined
to
go
wherever
i
did
i
thought
it
best
not
to
tell
you
at
all
for
i
did
not
think
it
advisable
that
you
should
go
with
me
and
i
wished
to
have
no
dispute
in
the
second
place
i
wish
to
say
something
about
an
offer
of
wedlock
which
you
made
me
perhaps
young
man
had
you
made
it
at
the
first
period
of
our
acquaintance
i
should
have
accepted
it
but
you
did
not
and
kept
putting
off
and
putting
off
and
behaving
in
a
very
strange
manner
till
i
could
stand
your
conduct
no
longer
but
determined
upon
leaving
you
and
old
england
which
last
step
i
had
been
long
thinking
about
so
when
you
made
your
offer
at
last
everything
was
arranged
my
cart
and
donkey
engaged
to
be
sold
and
the
greater
part
of
my
things
disposed
of
however
young
man
when
you
did
make
it
i
frankly
tell
you
that
i
had
half
a
mind
to
accept
it
at
last
however
after
very
much
consideration
i
thought
it
best
to
leave
you
for
ever
because
for
some
time
past
i
had
become
almost
convinced
that
though
with
a
wonderful
deal
of
learning
and
exceedingly
shrewd
in
some
things
you
were
pray
do
be
offended
at
the
root
mad
and
though
mad
people
i
have
been
told
sometimes
make
very
good
husbands
i
was
unwilling
that
your
friends
if
you
had
any
should
say
that
belle
berners
the
workhouse
girl
took
advantage
of
your
infirmity
for
there
is
no
concealing
that
i
was
born
and
bred
up
in
a
workhouse
notwithstanding
that
my
blood
is
better
than
your
own
and
as
good
as
the
best
you
having
yourself
told
me
that
my
name
is
a
noble
name
and
once
if
i
mistake
not
that
it
was
the
same
word
as
baron
which
is
the
same
thing
as
bear
and
that
to
be
called
in
old
times
a
bear
was
considered
a
great
compliment
the
bear
being
a
mighty
strong
animal
on
which
account
our
forefathers
called
all
their
great
barons
which
is
the
same
as
bears
however
setting
matters
of
blood
and
family
entirely
aside
many
thanks
to
you
young
man
from
poor
belle
for
the
honour
you
did
her
in
making
that
same
offer
for
after
all
it
is
an
honour
to
receive
an
honourable
offer
which
she
could
see
clearly
yours
was
with
no
floriness
nor
chaff
in
it
but
on
the
contrary
entire
sincerity
she
assures
you
that
she
shall
always
bear
it
and
yourself
in
mind
whether
on
land
or
water
and
as
a
proof
of
the
she
bears
to
you
she
sends
you
a
lock
of
the
hair
which
she
wears
on
her
head
which
you
were
often
looking
at
and
were
pleased
to
call
flax
which
word
she
supposes
you
meant
as
a
compliment
even
as
the
old
people
meant
to
pass
a
compliment
to
their
great
folks
when
they
called
them
bears
though
she
can
not
help
thinking
that
they
might
have
found
an
animal
as
strong
as
a
bear
and
somewhat
less
uncouth
to
call
their
great
folks
after
even
as
she
thinks
yourself
amongst
your
great
store
of
words
might
have
found
something
a
little
more
genteel
to
call
her
hair
after
than
flax
which
though
strong
and
useful
is
rather
a
coarse
and
common
kind
of
article
and
as
another
proof
of
the
she
bears
to
you
she
sends
you
along
with
the
lock
a
piece
of
advice
which
is
worth
all
the
hair
in
the
world
to
say
nothing
of
the
flax
and
take
your
own
part
there
bible
in
that
young
man
see
how
moses
feared
god
and
how
he
took
his
own
part
against
everybody
who
meddled
with
him
and
see
how
david
feared
god
and
took
his
own
part
against
all
the
bloody
enemies
which
surrounded
him
so
fear
god
young
man
and
never
give
in
the
world
can
bully
and
is
fond
provided
it
sees
a
man
in
a
kind
of
difficulty
of
getting
about
him
calling
him
coarse
names
and
even
going
so
far
as
to
hustle
him
but
the
world
like
all
bullies
carries
a
white
feather
in
its
tail
and
no
sooner
sees
the
man
taking
off
his
coat
and
offering
to
fight
its
best
than
it
scatters
here
and
there
and
is
always
civil
to
him
afterwards
so
when
folks
are
disposed
to
treat
you
young
man
say
have
mercy
upon
me
and
then
tip
them
to
long
melford
which
as
the
saying
goes
there
is
nothing
comparable
for
shortness
all
the
world
over
and
these
last
words
young
man
are
the
last
you
will
ever
have
from
her
who
is
nevertheless
your
affectionate
female
servant
isopel
berners
after
reading
the
letter
i
sat
for
some
time
motionless
holding
it
in
my
hand
the
daydream
in
which
i
had
been
a
little
time
before
indulging
of
marrying
isopel
berners
of
going
with
her
to
america
and
having
by
her
a
large
progeny
who
were
to
assist
me
in
felling
trees
cultivating
the
soil
and
who
would
take
care
of
me
when
i
was
old
was
now
thoroughly
dispelled
isopel
had
deserted
me
and
was
gone
to
america
by
herself
where
perhaps
she
would
marry
some
other
person
and
would
bear
him
a
progeny
who
would
do
for
him
what
in
my
dream
i
had
hoped
my
progeny
by
her
would
do
for
me
then
the
thought
came
into
my
head
that
though
she
was
gone
i
might
follow
her
to
america
but
then
i
thought
that
if
i
did
i
might
not
find
her
america
was
a
very
large
place
and
i
did
not
know
the
port
to
which
she
was
bound
but
i
could
follow
her
to
the
port
from
which
she
had
sailed
and
there
possibly
discover
the
port
to
which
she
was
bound
but
i
did
not
even
know
the
port
from
which
she
had
set
out
for
isopel
had
not
dated
her
letter
from
any
place
suddenly
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
on
the
letter
would
tell
me
from
whence
it
came
so
i
forthwith
looked
at
the
back
of
the
letter
and
in
the
read
the
name
of
a
and
not
very
distant
i
then
knew
with
tolerable
certainty
the
port
where
she
had
embarked
and
i
almost
determined
to
follow
her
but
i
almost
instantly
determined
to
do
no
such
thing
isopel
berners
had
abandoned
me
and
i
would
not
follow
her
perhaps
whispered
pride
if
i
overtook
her
she
would
only
despise
me
for
running
after
her
and
it
also
told
me
pretty
roundly
provided
i
ran
after
her
whether
i
overtook
her
or
not
i
should
heartily
despise
myself
so
i
determined
not
to
follow
isopel
berners
i
took
her
lock
of
hair
and
looked
at
it
then
put
it
in
her
letter
which
i
folded
up
and
carefully
stowed
away
resolved
to
keep
both
for
ever
but
i
determined
not
to
follow
her
two
or
three
times
however
during
the
day
i
wavered
in
my
determination
and
was
again
and
again
almost
tempted
to
follow
her
but
every
succeeding
time
the
temptation
was
fainter
in
the
evening
i
left
the
dingle
and
sat
down
with
petulengro
and
his
family
by
the
door
of
his
tent
petulengro
soon
began
talking
of
the
letter
which
i
had
received
in
the
morning
is
it
not
from
miss
berners
brother
said
he
i
told
him
it
was
is
she
coming
back
brother
never
said
i
she
is
gone
to
america
and
has
deserted
me
i
always
knew
that
you
two
were
never
destined
for
each
other
said
he
how
did
you
know
that
i
inquired
the
dook
told
me
so
brother
you
are
born
to
be
a
great
traveller
well
said
i
if
i
had
gone
with
her
to
america
as
i
was
thinking
of
doing
i
should
have
been
a
great
traveller
you
are
to
travel
in
another
direction
brother
said
he
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
all
about
my
future
wanderings
said
i
i
ca
brother
said
petulengro
there
a
power
of
clouds
before
my
eye
you
are
a
poor
seer
after
all
said
i
and
getting
up
i
retired
to
my
dingle
and
my
tent
where
i
betook
myself
to
my
bed
and
there
knowing
the
worst
and
being
no
longer
agitated
by
apprehension
nor
agonized
by
expectation
i
was
soon
buried
in
a
deep
slumber
the
first
which
i
had
fallen
into
for
several
nights
chapter
xvii
the
landlord
on
his
legs
again
a
blow
in
season
the
way
of
the
world
the
grateful
mind
the
horse
neigh
it
was
rather
late
on
the
following
morning
when
i
awoke
at
first
i
was
almost
unconscious
of
what
had
occurred
on
the
preceding
day
recollection
however
by
degrees
returned
and
i
felt
a
deep
melancholy
coming
over
me
but
perfectly
aware
that
no
advantage
could
be
derived
from
the
indulgence
of
such
a
feeling
i
sprang
up
prepared
my
breakfast
which
i
ate
with
a
tolerable
appetite
and
then
left
the
dingle
and
betook
myself
to
the
gypsy
encampment
where
i
entered
into
discourse
with
various
romanies
both
male
and
female
after
some
time
feeling
myself
in
better
spirits
i
determined
to
pay
another
visit
to
the
landlord
of
the
from
the
position
of
his
affairs
when
i
had
last
visited
him
i
entertained
rather
gloomy
ideas
with
respect
to
his
present
circumstances
i
imagined
that
i
should
either
find
him
alone
in
his
kitchen
smoking
a
wretched
pipe
or
in
company
with
some
surly
bailiff
or
his
follower
whom
his
friend
the
brewer
had
sent
into
the
house
in
order
to
take
possession
of
his
effects
nothing
more
entirely
differing
from
either
of
these
anticipations
could
have
presented
itself
to
my
view
than
what
i
saw
about
one
in
the
afternoon
when
i
entered
the
house
i
had
come
though
somewhat
in
want
of
consolation
myself
to
offer
any
consolation
which
was
at
my
command
to
my
acquaintance
catchpole
and
perhaps
like
many
other
people
who
go
to
a
house
with
drops
of
compassion
trembling
on
their
eyelids
i
felt
rather
disappointed
at
finding
that
no
compassion
was
necessary
the
house
was
thronged
with
company
and
cries
for
ale
and
porter
hot
brandy
and
water
cold
gin
and
water
were
numerous
moreover
no
desire
to
receive
and
not
to
pay
for
the
landlord
liquids
was
manifested
on
the
contrary
everybody
seemed
disposed
to
play
the
most
honourable
part
landlord
here
the
money
for
this
glass
of
brandy
and
water
do
me
the
favour
to
take
it
all
right
remember
i
have
paid
you
landlord
here
the
money
for
the
pint
of
halfpenny
it
here
sixpence
keep
the
change
confound
the
change
the
landlord
assisted
by
his
niece
bustled
about
his
brow
erect
his
cheeks
plumped
out
and
all
his
features
exhibiting
a
kind
of
surly
satisfaction
wherever
he
moved
marks
of
the
most
cordial
amity
were
shown
him
hands
were
thrust
out
to
grasp
his
nor
were
looks
of
respect
admiration
nay
almost
of
adoration
wanting
i
observed
one
fellow
as
the
landlord
advanced
take
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
gaze
upon
him
with
a
kind
of
grin
of
wonder
probably
much
the
same
as
his
ancestor
the
saxon
lout
of
old
put
on
when
he
saw
his
idol
thur
dressed
in
a
new
kirtle
to
avoid
the
press
i
got
into
a
corner
where
on
a
couple
of
chairs
sat
two
individuals
whether
farmers
or
gelders
i
know
not
but
highly
who
were
discoursing
about
the
landlord
such
another
said
one
you
will
not
find
in
a
summer
day
no
nor
in
the
whole
of
england
said
the
other
tom
of
hopton
said
the
first
ah
tom
of
hopton
echoed
the
other
the
man
who
could
beat
tom
of
hopton
could
beat
the
world
i
glory
in
him
said
the
first
so
do
i
said
the
second
i
back
him
against
the
world
let
me
hear
any
one
say
anything
against
him
and
if
i
do
then
looking
at
me
he
added
have
you
anything
to
say
against
him
young
man
not
a
word
said
i
save
that
he
regularly
puts
me
out
he
put
any
one
out
said
the
man
any
one
out
of
conceit
with
himself
then
lifting
a
mug
to
his
mouth
he
added
with
a
hiccough
i
drink
his
health
presently
the
landlord
as
he
moved
about
observing
me
stopped
short
ah
said
he
are
you
here
i
am
glad
to
see
you
come
this
way
stand
back
said
he
to
his
company
as
i
followed
him
to
the
bar
stand
back
for
me
and
this
gentleman
two
or
three
young
fellows
were
in
the
bar
seemingly
sporting
yokels
drinking
sherry
and
smoking
come
gentlemen
said
the
landlord
clear
the
bar
i
must
have
a
clear
bar
for
me
and
my
friend
here
landlord
what
will
you
take
said
one
a
glass
of
sherry
i
know
you
like
it
sherry
and
you
too
said
the
landlord
i
want
neither
sherry
nor
yourself
did
you
hear
what
i
told
you
all
right
old
fellow
said
the
other
shaking
the
landlord
by
the
hand
all
right
do
wish
to
intrude
but
i
suppose
when
you
and
your
friend
have
done
i
may
come
in
again
then
with
a
sarvant
sir
to
me
he
took
himself
into
the
kitchen
followed
by
the
rest
of
the
sporting
yokels
thereupon
the
landlord
taking
a
bottle
of
ale
from
a
basket
uncorked
it
and
pouring
the
contents
into
two
large
glasses
handed
me
one
and
motioning
me
to
sit
down
placed
himself
by
me
then
emptying
his
own
glass
at
a
draught
he
gave
a
kind
of
grunt
of
satisfaction
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
bar
remained
motionless
without
saying
a
word
buried
apparently
in
important
cogitations
with
respect
to
myself
i
swallowed
my
ale
more
leisurely
and
was
about
to
address
my
friend
when
his
niece
coming
into
the
bar
said
that
more
and
more
customers
were
arriving
and
how
she
should
supply
their
wants
she
did
not
know
unless
her
uncle
would
get
and
help
her
the
customers
said
the
landlord
let
the
scoundrels
wait
till
you
have
time
to
serve
them
or
till
i
have
leisure
to
see
after
them
the
kitchen
wo
contain
half
of
them
said
his
niece
then
let
them
sit
out
abroad
said
the
landlord
but
there
are
not
benches
enough
uncle
said
the
niece
then
let
them
stand
or
sit
on
the
ground
said
the
uncle
what
care
i
i
let
them
know
that
the
man
who
beat
tom
of
hopton
stands
as
well
again
on
his
legs
as
ever
then
opening
a
side
door
which
led
from
the
bar
into
the
back
yard
he
beckoned
me
to
follow
him
you
treat
your
customers
in
rather
a
cavalier
manner
said
i
when
we
were
alone
together
in
the
yard
do
i
said
the
landlord
and
i
treat
them
more
so
yet
now
i
have
got
the
whiphand
of
the
rascals
i
intend
to
keep
it
i
dare
say
you
are
a
bit
surprised
with
regard
to
the
change
which
has
come
over
things
since
you
were
last
here
i
tell
you
how
it
happened
you
remember
in
what
a
desperate
condition
you
found
me
thinking
of
changing
my
religion
selling
my
soul
to
the
man
in
black
and
then
going
and
hanging
myself
like
pontius
pilate
and
i
dare
say
you
ca
have
forgotten
how
you
gave
me
good
advice
made
me
drink
ale
and
give
up
sherry
well
after
you
were
gone
i
felt
all
the
better
for
your
talk
and
what
you
had
made
me
drink
and
it
was
a
mercy
that
i
did
feel
better
for
my
niece
was
gone
out
poor
thing
and
i
was
left
alone
in
the
house
without
a
soul
to
look
at
or
to
keep
me
from
doing
myself
a
mischief
in
case
i
was
so
inclined
well
things
wore
on
in
this
way
till
it
grew
dusk
when
in
came
that
blackguard
hunter
with
his
train
to
drink
at
my
expense
and
to
insult
me
as
usual
there
were
more
than
a
dozen
of
them
and
a
pretty
set
they
looked
well
they
ordered
about
in
a
very
free
and
easy
manner
for
upwards
of
an
hour
and
a
half
occasionally
sneering
and
jeering
at
me
as
they
had
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
for
some
time
past
so
as
i
said
before
things
wore
on
and
other
customers
came
in
who
though
they
did
not
belong
to
hunter
gang
also
passed
off
their
jokes
upon
me
for
as
you
perhaps
know
we
english
are
a
set
of
low
hounds
who
will
always
take
part
with
the
many
by
way
of
making
ourselves
safe
and
currying
favour
with
the
stronger
side
i
said
little
or
nothing
for
my
spirits
had
again
become
very
low
and
i
was
verily
scared
and
afraid
all
of
a
sudden
i
thought
of
the
ale
which
i
had
drank
in
the
morning
and
of
the
good
it
did
me
then
so
i
went
into
the
bar
opened
another
bottle
took
a
glass
and
felt
better
so
i
took
another
and
feeling
better
still
i
went
back
into
the
kitchen
just
as
hunter
and
his
crew
were
about
leaving
hunter
said
i
and
your
people
will
please
to
pay
me
for
what
you
have
had
do
you
mean
by
my
people
said
he
with
an
oath
what
do
you
mean
by
calling
us
his
people
said
the
clan
are
nobody
people
and
then
there
was
a
pretty
load
of
abuse
and
threatening
to
serve
me
out
said
i
was
perhaps
wrong
to
call
them
your
people
and
beg
your
pardon
and
theirs
and
now
you
will
please
to
pay
me
for
what
you
have
had
yourself
and
afterwards
i
can
settle
with
them
shall
pay
you
when
i
think
fit
said
hunter
said
the
rest
so
shall
we
we
shall
pay
you
when
we
think
fit
tell
you
what
said
hunter
conceives
i
do
such
an
old
fool
as
you
an
honour
when
i
comes
into
his
house
and
drinks
his
beer
and
goes
away
without
paying
for
it
and
then
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
from
everybody
and
almost
all
said
the
same
thing
do
you
please
to
pay
me
mr
hunter
said
i
you
said
hunter
you
yes
here
the
pay
and
thereupon
he
held
out
his
thumb
twirling
it
round
till
it
just
touched
my
nose
i
tell
you
what
i
felt
that
moment
a
kind
of
madhouse
thrill
came
upon
me
and
all
i
know
is
that
i
bent
back
as
far
as
i
could
then
lunging
out
struck
him
under
the
ear
sending
him
reeling
two
or
three
yards
when
he
fell
on
the
floor
i
wish
you
had
but
seen
how
my
company
looked
at
me
and
at
each
other
one
or
two
of
the
clan
went
to
raise
hunter
and
get
him
to
fight
but
it
was
no
go
though
he
was
not
killed
he
had
had
enough
for
that
evening
oh
i
wish
you
had
seen
my
customers
those
who
did
not
belong
to
the
clan
but
who
had
taken
part
with
them
and
helped
to
jeer
and
flout
me
now
came
and
shook
me
by
the
hand
wishing
me
joy
and
saying
as
how
was
a
brave
fellow
and
had
served
the
bully
right
as
for
the
clan
they
all
said
hunter
was
bound
to
do
me
justice
so
they
made
him
pay
me
what
he
owed
for
himself
and
the
reckoning
of
those
among
them
who
said
they
had
no
money
two
or
three
of
them
then
led
him
away
while
the
rest
stayed
behind
and
flattered
me
and
worshipped
me
and
called
hunter
all
kinds
of
dogs
names
what
do
you
think
of
that
why
said
i
it
makes
good
what
i
read
in
a
letter
which
i
received
yesterday
it
is
just
the
way
of
the
world
it
said
the
landlord
well
that
all
let
me
go
on
good
fortune
never
yet
came
alone
in
about
an
hour
comes
home
my
poor
niece
almost
in
high
sterricks
with
joy
smiling
and
sobbing
she
had
been
to
the
clergyman
of
m
the
great
preacher
to
whose
church
she
was
in
the
habit
of
going
and
to
whose
daughters
she
was
well
known
and
to
him
she
told
a
lamentable
tale
about
my
distresses
and
about
the
snares
which
had
been
laid
for
my
soul
and
so
well
did
she
plead
my
cause
and
so
strong
did
the
young
ladies
back
all
she
said
that
the
good
clergyman
promised
to
stand
my
friend
and
to
lend
me
sufficient
money
to
satisfy
the
brewer
and
to
get
my
soul
out
of
the
snares
of
the
man
in
black
and
sure
enough
the
next
morning
the
two
young
ladies
brought
me
the
fifty
pounds
which
i
forthwith
carried
to
the
brewer
who
was
monstrously
civil
saying
that
he
hoped
any
little
misunderstanding
we
had
had
would
not
prevent
our
being
good
friends
in
future
that
all
the
people
of
the
neighbouring
county
hearing
as
if
by
art
witchcraft
that
i
had
licked
hunter
and
was
on
good
terms
with
the
brewer
forthwith
began
to
come
in
crowds
to
look
at
me
pay
me
homage
and
be
my
customers
moreover
fifty
scoundrels
who
owed
me
money
and
would
have
seen
me
starve
rather
than
help
me
as
long
as
they
considered
me
a
down
pin
remembered
their
debts
and
came
and
paid
me
more
than
they
owed
that
all
the
brewer
being
about
to
establish
a
and
three
to
run
across
the
country
says
it
shall
stop
and
change
horses
at
my
house
and
the
passengers
breakfast
and
sup
as
it
goes
and
returns
he
wishes
me
whom
he
calls
the
best
man
in
england
to
give
his
son
lessons
in
boxing
which
he
says
he
considers
a
fine
manly
english
art
and
a
great
defence
against
popery
notwithstanding
that
only
a
month
ago
when
he
considered
me
a
down
pin
he
was
in
the
habit
of
railing
against
it
as
a
blackguard
practice
and
against
me
as
a
blackguard
for
following
it
so
i
am
going
to
commence
with
young
hopeful
i
really
can
not
help
congratulating
you
on
your
good
fortune
said
i
that
all
said
the
landlord
this
very
morning
the
folks
of
our
parish
made
me
churchwarden
which
they
would
no
more
have
done
a
month
ago
when
they
considered
me
a
down
pin
than
they
mercy
upon
us
said
i
if
fortune
pours
in
upon
you
in
this
manner
who
knows
but
that
within
a
year
they
may
make
you
a
justice
of
the
peace
who
knows
indeed
said
the
landlord
well
i
will
prove
myself
worthy
of
my
good
luck
by
showing
the
grateful
mind
not
to
those
who
would
be
kind
to
me
now
but
to
those
who
were
when
the
days
were
rather
gloomy
my
customers
shall
have
abundance
of
rough
language
but
knock
any
one
down
who
says
anything
against
the
clergyman
who
lent
me
the
fifty
pounds
or
against
the
church
of
england
of
which
he
is
parson
and
i
am
churchwarden
i
am
also
ready
to
do
anything
in
reason
for
him
who
paid
me
for
the
ale
he
drank
when
i
should
have
had
the
heart
to
collar
him
for
the
money
had
he
refused
to
pay
who
never
jeered
or
flouted
me
like
the
rest
of
my
customers
when
i
was
a
down
pin
and
though
he
refused
to
fight
cross
me
was
never
cross
me
but
listened
to
all
i
had
to
say
and
gave
me
all
kinds
of
good
advice
now
who
do
you
think
i
mean
by
this
last
why
who
but
yourself
who
on
earth
but
yourself
the
parson
is
a
good
man
and
a
great
preacher
and
knock
anybody
down
who
says
to
the
contrary
and
i
mention
him
first
because
why
he
a
gentleman
and
you
a
tinker
but
i
am
by
no
means
sure
you
are
not
the
best
friend
of
the
two
for
i
doubt
do
you
see
whether
i
should
have
had
the
fifty
pounds
but
for
you
you
persuaded
me
to
give
up
that
silly
drink
they
call
sherry
and
drink
ale
and
what
was
it
but
drinking
ale
which
gave
me
courage
to
knock
down
that
fellow
hunter
and
knocking
him
down
was
i
verily
believe
the
turning
point
of
my
disorder
god
do
love
them
who
wo
strike
out
for
themselves
and
as
far
as
i
can
calculate
with
respect
to
time
it
was
just
the
moment
after
i
had
knocked
down
hunter
that
the
parson
consented
to
lend
me
the
money
and
everything
began
to
grow
civil
to
me
so
dash
my
buttons
if
i
show
the
ungrateful
mind
to
you
i
do
offer
to
knock
anybody
down
for
you
because
why
i
dare
say
you
can
knock
a
body
down
yourself
but
i
offer
something
more
to
the
purpose
as
my
business
is
wonderfully
on
the
increase
i
shall
want
somebody
to
help
me
in
serving
my
customers
and
keeping
them
in
order
if
you
choose
to
come
and
serve
for
your
board
and
what
they
give
you
give
me
your
fist
or
if
you
like
ten
shillings
a
week
better
than
their
sixpences
and
only
say
so
though
to
be
open
with
you
i
believe
you
would
make
twice
ten
shillings
out
of
them
the
sneaking
fawning
humbugs
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
said
i
for
your
handsome
offer
which
however
i
am
obliged
to
decline
why
so
said
the
landlord
i
am
not
fit
for
service
said
i
moreover
i
am
about
to
leave
this
part
of
the
country
as
i
spoke
a
horse
neighed
in
the
stable
what
horse
is
that
said
i
it
belongs
to
a
cousin
of
mine
who
put
it
into
my
hands
yesterday
in
the
hopes
that
i
might
get
rid
of
it
for
him
though
he
would
no
more
have
done
so
a
week
ago
when
he
considered
me
a
down
pin
than
he
would
have
given
the
horse
away
are
you
fond
of
horses
very
much
said
i
then
come
and
look
at
it
he
led
me
into
the
stable
where
in
a
stall
stood
a
animal
dear
me
said
i
i
saw
this
horse
at
fair
like
enough
said
the
landlord
he
was
there
and
was
offered
for
seventy
pounds
but
did
find
a
bidder
at
any
price
what
do
you
think
of
him
he
a
splendid
creature
i
am
no
judge
of
horses
said
the
landlord
but
i
am
told
he
a
rate
trotter
good
leaper
and
has
some
of
the
blood
of
syntax
what
does
all
that
signify
the
game
is
against
his
master
who
is
a
down
pin
is
thinking
of
emigrating
and
wants
money
confoundedly
he
asked
seventy
pounds
at
the
fair
but
between
ourselves
he
would
be
glad
to
take
fifty
here
i
almost
wish
said
i
that
i
were
a
rich
squire
you
would
buy
him
then
said
the
landlord
here
he
mused
for
some
time
with
a
very
profound
look
it
would
be
a
rum
thing
said
he
if
some
time
or
other
that
horse
should
come
into
your
hands
you
hear
how
he
neighed
when
you
talked
about
leaving
the
country
my
granny
was
a
wise
woman
and
was
up
to
all
kinds
of

and
wonders

and
noises

the

and
animals
crowing
and

and
braying
if
she
had
been
here
she
would
have
said
at
once
that
that
horse
was
fated
to
carry
you
away
on
that
point
however
i
can
say
nothing
for
under
fifty
pounds
no
one
can
have
him
are
you
taking
that
money
out
of
your
pocket
to
pay
me
for
the
ale
that
wo
do

petulengro
device
the
leathern
purse
consent
to
purchase
a
horse
as
i
returned
along
the
road
i
met
petulengro
and
one
of
his
companions
who
told
me
that
they
were
bound
for
the
whereupon
i
informed
jasper
how
i
had
seen
in
the
stable
the
horse
which
we
had
admired
at
the
fair
i
should
wonder
if
you
buy
that
horse
after
all
brother
said
petulengro
with
a
smile
at
the
absurdity
of
such
a
supposition
i
left
him
and
his
companion
and
betook
myself
to
the
dingle
in
the
evening
i
received
a
visit
from
petulengro
who
forthwith
commenced
talking
about
the
horse
which
he
had
again
seen
the
landlord
having
shown
it
to
him
on
learning
that
he
was
a
friend
of
mine
he
told
me
that
the
horse
pleased
him
more
than
ever
he
having
examined
his
points
with
more
accuracy
than
he
had
an
opportunity
of
doing
on
the
first
occasion
concluding
by
pressing
me
to
buy
him
i
begged
him
to
desist
from
such
foolish
importunity
assuring
him
that
i
had
never
so
much
money
in
all
my
life
as
would
enable
me
to
purchase
the
horse
whilst
this
discourse
was
going
on
petulengro
and
myself
were
standing
together
in
the
midst
of
the
dingle
suddenly
he
began
to
move
round
me
in
a
very
singular
manner
making
strange
motions
with
his
hands
and
frightful
contortions
with
his
features
till
i
became
alarmed
and
asked
him
whether
he
had
not
lost
his
senses
whereupon
ceasing
his
movements
and
contortions
he
assured
me
that
he
had
not
but
had
merely
been
seized
with
a
slight
dizziness
and
then
once
more
returned
to
the
subject
of
the
horse
feeling
myself
very
angry
i
told
him
that
if
he
continued
persecuting
me
in
that
manner
i
should
be
obliged
to
quarrel
with
him
adding
that
i
believed
his
only
motive
for
asking
me
to
buy
the
animal
was
to
insult
my
poverty
pretty
poverty
said
he
with
fifty
pounds
in
your
pocket
however
i
have
heard
say
that
it
is
always
the
custom
of
your
rich
people
to
talk
of
their
poverty
more
especially
when
they
wish
to
avoid
laying
out
money
surprised
at
his
saying
that
i
had
fifty
pounds
in
my
pocket
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
whereupon
he
told
me
that
he
was
very
sure
that
i
had
fifty
pounds
in
my
pocket
offering
to
lay
me
five
shillings
to
that
effect
done
said
i
i
have
scarcely
more
than
the
fifth
part
of
what
you
say
i
know
better
brother
said
petulengro
if
you
only
pull
out
what
you
have
in
the
pocket
of
your
slop
i
am
sure
you
will
have
lost
your
wager
putting
my
hand
into
the
pocket
i
felt
something
which
i
had
never
felt
there
before
and
pulling
it
out
perceived
that
it
was
a
clumsy
leathern
purse
which
i
found
on
opening
contained
four
and
several
pieces
of
gold
did
i
tell
you
so
brother
said
petulengro
now
in
the
first
place
please
to
pay
me
the
five
shillings
you
have
lost
this
is
only
a
foolish
piece
of
pleasantry
said
i
you
put
it
into
my
pocket
whilst
you
were
moving
about
me
making
faces
like
a
distracted
person
here
take
your
purse
back
i
said
petulengro
not
i
indeed
i
think
i
am
such
a
fool
i
have
won
my
wager
so
pay
me
the
five
shillings
brother
do
drop
this
folly
said
i
and
take
your
purse
and
i
flung
it
on
the
ground
brother
said
petulengro
you
were
talking
of
quarrelling
with
me
just
now
i
tell
you
now
one
thing
which
is
that
if
you
do
not
take
back
the
purse
i
will
quarrel
with
you
and
it
shall
be
for
good
and
all
i
drop
your
acquaintance
no
longer
call
you
my
pal
and
not
even
say
sarshan
to
you
when
i
meet
you
by
the
roadside
hir
mi
diblis
i
never
will
i
saw
by
look
and
tone
that
he
was
in
earnest
and
as
i
had
really
a
regard
for
the
strange
being
i
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
now
be
persuaded
brother
said
petulengro
taking
up
the
purse
and
handing
it
to
me
be
persuaded
put
the
purse
into
your
pocket
and
buy
the
horse
well
said
i
if
i
did
so
would
you
acknowledge
the
horse
to
be
yours
and
receive
the
money
again
as
soon
as
i
should
be
able
to
repay
you
i
would
brother
i
would
said
he
return
me
the
money
as
soon
as
you
please
provided
you
buy
the
horse
what
motive
have
you
for
wishing
me
to
buy
that
horse
said
i
he
to
be
sold
for
fifty
pounds
said
jasper
and
is
worth
four
times
that
sum
though
like
many
a
splendid
bargain
he
is
now
going
a
begging
buy
him
and
i
confident
that
in
a
little
time
a
grand
gentleman
of
your
appearance
may
have
anything
he
asks
for
him
and
found
a
fortune
by
his
means
moreover
brother
i
want
to
dispose
of
this
fifty
pounds
in
a
safe
manner
if
you
do
take
it
i
shall
fool
it
away
in
no
time
perhaps
at
for
you
saw
how
i
was
cheated
by
those
blackguard
jockeys
the
other
day
we
gyptians
do
know
how
to
take
care
of
money
our
best
plan
when
we
have
got
a
handful
of
guineas
is
to
make
buttons
with
them
but
i
have
plenty
of
golden
buttons
and
do
wish
to
be
troubled
with
more
so
you
can
do
me
no
greater
favour
than
vesting
the
money
in
this
speculation
by
which
my
mind
will
be
relieved
of
considerable
care
and
trouble
for
some
time
at
least
perceiving
that
i
still
hesitated
he
said
perhaps
brother
you
think
i
did
not
come
honestly
by
the
money
by
the
honestest
manner
in
the
world
for
it
is
the
money
i
earnt
by
fighting
in
the
ring
i
did
not
steal
it
brother
nor
did
i
get
it
by
disposing
of
spavined
donkeys
or
glandered
ponies
nor
is
it
brother
the
profits
of
my
wife
witchcraft
and
dukkerin
but
said
i
you
had
better
employ
it
in
your
traffic
i
have
plenty
of
money
for
my
traffic
independent
of
this
capital
said
petulengro
ay
brother
and
enough
besides
to
back
the
husband
of
my
wife
sister
sylvester
against
slammocks
of
the
chong
gav
for
twenty
pounds
which
i
am
thinking
of
doing
but
said
i
after
all
the
horse
may
have
found
another
purchaser
by
this
time
not
he
said
petulengro
there
is
nobody
in
this
neighbourhood
to
purchase
a
horse
like
that
unless
it
be
your
lordship
so
take
the
money
brother
and
he
thrust
the
purse
into
my
hand
allowing
myself
to
be
persuaded
i
kept
possession
of
the
purse
are
you
satisfied
now
said
i
by
no
means
brother
said
petulengro
you
will
please
to
pay
me
the
five
shillings
which
you
lost
to
me
why
said
i
the
fifty
pounds
which
i
found
in
my
pocket
were
not
mine
but
put
in
by
yourself
that
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
brother
said
petulengro
i
betted
you
five
shillings
that
you
had
fifty
pounds
in
your
pocket
which
sum
you
had
i
did
not
say
that
they
were
your
own
but
merely
that
you
had
fifty
pounds
you
will
therefore
pay
me
brother
or
i
shall
not
consider
you
an
honourable
man
not
wishing
to
have
any
dispute
about
such
a
matter
i
took
five
shillings
out
of
my
under
pocket
and
gave
them
to
him
petulengro
took
the
money
with
great
glee
observing
these
five
shillings
i
will
take
to
the
forthwith
and
spend
in
drinking
with
four
of
my
brethren
and
doing
so
will
give
me
an
opportunity
of
telling
the
landlord
that
i
have
found
a
customer
for
his
horse
and
that
you
are
the
man
it
will
be
as
well
to
secure
the
horse
as
soon
as
possible
for
though
the
dook
tells
me
that
the
horse
is
intended
for
you
i
have
now
and
then
found
that
the
dook
is
like
myself
somewhat
given
to
lying
he
then
departed
and
i
remained
alone
in
the
dingle
i
thought
at
first
that
i
had
committed
a
great
piece
of
folly
in
consenting
to
purchase
this
horse
i
might
find
no
desirable
purchaser
for
him
until
the
money
in
my
possession
should
be
totally
exhausted
and
then
i
might
be
compelled
to
sell
him
for
half
the
price
i
had
given
for
him
or
be
even
glad
to
find
a
person
who
would
receive
him
at
a
gift
i
should
then
remain
sans
horse
and
indebted
to
petulengro
nevertheless
it
was
possible
that
i
might
sell
the
horse
very
advantageously
and
by
so
doing
obtain
a
fund
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
execute
some
grand
enterprise
or
other
my
present
way
of
life
afforded
no
prospect
of
support
whereas
the
purchase
of
the
horse
did
afford
a
possibility
of
bettering
my
condition
so
after
all
had
i
not
done
right
in
consenting
to
purchase
the
horse
the
purchase
was
to
be
made
with
another
person
property
it
is
true
and
i
did
not
exactly
like
the
idea
of
speculating
with
another
person
property
but
petulengro
had
thrust
his
money
upon
me
and
if
i
lost
his
money
he
could
have
no
one
but
himself
to
blame
so
i
persuaded
myself
that
i
had
upon
the
whole
done
right
and
having
come
to
that
persuasion
i
soon
began
to
enjoy
the
idea
of
finding
myself
on
horseback
again
and
figured
to
myself
all
kinds
of
strange
adventures
which
i
should
meet
with
on
the
roads
before
the
horse
and
i
should
part
company
chapter
xix
trying
the
horse
the
feats
of
tawno
man
with
the
red
disposal
of
property
i
saw
nothing
more
of
petulengro
that
evening
on
the
morrow
however
he
came
and
informed
me
that
he
had
secured
the
horse
for
me
and
that
i
was
to
go
and
pay
for
it
at
noon
at
the
hour
appointed
therefore
i
went
with
petulengro
and
tawno
to
the
public
where
as
before
there
was
a
crowd
of
company
the
landlord
received
us
in
the
bar
with
marks
of
much
satisfaction
and
esteem
made
us
sit
down
and
treated
us
with
some
excellent
mild
draught
ale
who
do
you
think
has
been
here
this
morning
he
said
to
me
why
that
fellow
in
black
who
came
to
carry
me
off
to
a
house
of
popish
devotion
where
i
was
to
pass
seven
days
and
nights
in
meditation
as
i
think
he
called
it
before
i
publicly
renounced
the
religion
of
my
country
i
read
him
a
pretty
lecture
calling
him
several
unhandsome
names
and
asking
him
what
he
meant
by
attempting
to
seduce
a
of
the
church
of
england
i
tell
you
what
he
ran
some
danger
for
some
of
my
customers
learning
his
errand
laid
hold
on
him
and
were
about
to
toss
him
in
a
blanket
and
then
duck
him
in
the
i
however
interfered
and
said
what
he
came
about
was
between
me
and
him
and
that
it
was
no
business
of
theirs
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
felt
pity
for
the
poor
devil
more
especially
when
i
considered
that
they
merely
sided
against
him
because
they
thought
him
the
weakest
and
that
they
would
have
wanted
to
serve
me
in
the
same
manner
had
they
considered
me
a
down
pin
so
i
rescued
him
from
their
hands
told
him
not
to
be
afraid
for
that
nobody
should
touch
him
and
offered
to
treat
him
to
some
cold
gin
and
water
with
a
lump
of
sugar
in
it
and
on
his
refusing
told
him
that
he
had
better
make
himself
scarce
which
he
did
and
i
hope
i
shall
never
see
him
again
so
i
suppose
you
are
come
for
the
horse
mercy
upon
us
who
would
have
thought
you
would
have
become
the
purchaser
the
horse
however
seemed
to
know
it
by
his
neighing
how
did
you
ever
come
by
the
money
however
that
no
matter
of
mine
i
suppose
you
are
strongly
backed
by
certain
friends
you
have
i
informed
the
landlord
that
he
was
right
in
supposing
that
i
came
for
the
horse
but
that
before
i
paid
for
him
i
should
wish
to
prove
his
capabilities
with
all
my
heart
said
the
landlord
you
shall
mount
him
this
moment
then
going
into
the
stable
he
saddled
and
bridled
the
horse
and
presently
brought
him
out
before
the
door
i
mounted
him
petulengro
putting
a
heavy
whip
into
my
hand
and
saying
a
few
words
to
me
in
his
own
mysterious
language
the
horse
wants
no
whip
said
the
landlord
hold
your
tongue
daddy
said
petulengro
my
pal
knows
quite
well
what
to
do
with
the
whip
he
not
going
to
beat
the
horse
with
it
about
four
hundred
yards
from
the
house
there
was
a
hill
to
the
foot
of
which
the
road
ran
almost
on
a
perfect
level
towards
the
foot
of
this
hill
i
trotted
the
horse
who
set
off
at
a
long
swift
pace
seemingly
at
the
rate
of
about
sixteen
miles
an
hour
on
reaching
the
foot
of
the
hill
i
wheeled
the
animal
round
and
trotted
him
towards
the
house
the
horse
sped
faster
than
before
ere
he
had
advanced
a
hundred
yards
i
took
off
my
hat
in
obedience
to
the
advice
which
petulengro
had
given
me
in
his
own
language
and
holding
it
over
the
horse
head
commenced
drumming
on
the
crown
with
the
knob
of
the
whip
the
horse
gave
a
slight
start
but
instantly
recovering
himself
continued
his
trot
till
he
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
amidst
the
acclamations
of
the
company
who
had
all
rushed
out
of
the
house
to
be
spectators
of
what
was
going
on
i
see
now
what
you
wanted
the
whip
for
said
the
landlord
and
sure
enough
that
drumming
on
your
hat
was
no
bad
way
of
learning
whether
the
horse
was
quiet
or
not
well
did
you
ever
see
a
more
quiet
horse
or
a
better
trotter
my
cob
shall
trot
against
him
said
a
fellow
dressed
in
velveteen
mounted
on
a
low
animal
my
cob
shall
trot
against
him
to
the
hill
and
back
again
come
on
we
both
started
the
cob
kept
up
gallantly
against
the
horse
for
about
half
way
to
the
hill
when
he
began
to
lose
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
he
was
about
fifteen
yards
behind
whereupon
i
turned
slowly
and
waited
for
him
we
then
set
off
towards
the
house
but
now
the
cob
had
no
chance
being
at
least
twenty
yards
behind
when
i
reached
the
door
this
running
of
the
horse
the
wild
uncouth
forms
around
me
and
the
ale
and
beer
which
were
being
guzzled
from
pots
and
flagons
put
me
wonderfully
in
mind
of
the
ancient
of
the
heathen
north
i
almost
imagined
myself
gunnar
of
hlitharend
at
the
race
of
are
you
satisfied
said
the
landlord
did
you
tell
me
that
he
could
leap
i
demanded
i
am
told
he
can
said
the
landlord
but
i
ca
consent
that
he
should
be
tried
in
that
way
as
he
might
be
damaged
that
right
said
petulengro
do
trust
my
pal
to
leap
that
horse
he
merely
fling
him
down
and
break
his
neck
and
his
own
there
a
better
man
than
he
close
by
let
him
get
on
his
back
and
leap
him
you
mean
yourself
i
suppose
said
the
landlord
well
i
call
that
talking
modestly
and
nothing
becomes
a
young
man
more
than
modesty
it
i
daddy
said
petulengro
here
the
man
said
he
pointing
to
tawno
here
the
of
the
world
you
mean
the
breaker
said
the
landlord
that
big
fellow
would
break
down
my
cousin
horse
why
he
weighs
only
sixteen
stone
said
petulengro
and
his
sixteen
stone
with
his
way
of
handling
a
horse
does
not
press
so
much
as
any
other
one
thirteen
only
let
him
get
on
the
horse
back
and
you
see
what
he
can
do
no
said
the
landlord
it
wo
do
whereupon
petulengro
became
very
much
excited
and
pulling
out
a
handful
of
money
said
i
tell
you
what
i
forfeit
these
guineas
if
my
black
pal
there
does
the
horse
any
kind
of
damage
duck
me
in
the
if
i
do
well
said
the
landlord
for
the
sport
of
the
thing
i
consent
so
let
your
white
pal
get
down
and
our
black
pal
mount
as
soon
as
he
pleases
i
felt
rather
mortified
at
petulengro
interference
and
showed
no
disposition
to
quit
my
seat
whereupon
he
came
up
to
me
and
said
now
brother
do
get
out
of
the
saddle
you
are
no
bad
hand
at
trotting
i
am
willing
to
acknowledge
that
but
at
leaping
a
horse
there
is
no
one
like
tawno
let
every
dog
be
praised
for
his
own
gift
you
have
been
showing
off
in
your
line
for
the
last
now
do
give
tawno
a
chance
of
exhibiting
a
little
poor
fellow
he
has
often
a
chance
of
exhibiting
as
his
wife
keeps
him
so
much
out
of
sight
not
wishing
to
appear
desirous
of
engrossing
the
public
attention
and
feeling
rather
desirous
to
see
how
tawno
of
whose
exploits
in
leaping
horses
i
had
frequently
heard
would
acquit
himself
in
the
affair
i
at
length
dismounted
and
tawno
at
a
bound
leaped
into
the
saddle
where
he
really
looked
like
gunnar
of
hlitharend
save
and
except
the
complexion
of
gunnar
was
florid
whereas
that
of
tawno
was
of
nearly
mulatto
darkness
and
that
all
features
were

whereas
gunnar
had
a
snub
nose
there
a
behind
the
house
said
the
landlord
bar
said
petulengro
scornfully
do
you
think
my
black
pal
ever
rides
at
a
no
more
than
a
leap
over
that
tawno
just
past
the
house
in
the
direction
in
which
i
had
been
trotting
was
a
wall
about
four
feet
high
beyond
which
was
a
small
meadow
tawno
rode
the
horse
gently
up
to
the
wall
permitted
him
to
look
over
then
backed
him
for
about
ten
yards
and
pressing
his
calves
against
the
horse
sides
he
loosed
the
rein
and
the
horse
launching
forward
took
the
leap
in
gallant
style
well
done
man
and
horse
said
petulengro
now
come
back
tawno
the
leap
from
the
side
of
the
meadow
was
however
somewhat
higher
and
the
horse
when
pushed
at
it
at
first
turned
away
whereupon
tawno
backed
him
to
a
greater
distance
pushed
the
horse
to
a
full
gallop
giving
a
wild
cry
whereupon
the
horse
again
took
the
wall
slightly
grazing
one
of
his
legs
against
it
a
near
thing
said
the
landlord
but
a
good
leap
now
no
more
leaping
so
long
as
i
have
control
over
the
animal
the
horse
was
then
led
back
to
the
stable
and
the
landlord
myself
and
companions
going
into
the
bar
i
paid
down
the
money
for
the
horse
scarcely
was
the
bargain
concluded
when
two
or
three
of
the
company
began
to
envy
me
the
possession
of
the
horse
and
forcing
their
way
into
the
bar
with
much
noise
and
clamour
said
that
the
horse
had
been
sold
too
cheap
one
fellow
in
particular
with
a
red
waistcoat
the
son
of
a
wealthy
farmer
said
that
if
he
had
but
known
that
the
horse
had
been
so
good
a
one
he
would
have
bought
it
at
the
first
price
asked
for
it
which
he
was
now
willing
to
pay
that
is
supposing
supposing
your
father
will
let
you
have
the
money
said
the
landlord
which
after
all
might
not
be
the
case
but
however
that
may
be
it
is
too
late
now
i
think
myself
the
horse
has
been
sold
for
too
little
money
but
if
so
all
the
better
for
the
young
man
who
came
forward
when
no
other
body
did
with
his
money
in
his
hand
there
take
yourselves
out
of
my
bar
he
said
to
the
fellows
and
a
pretty
scoundrel
you
said
he
to
the
man
of
the
red
waistcoat
to
say
the
horse
has
been
sold
too
cheap
why
it
was
only
yesterday
you
said
he
was
good
for
nothing
and
were
passing
all
kinds
of
jokes
at
him
take
yourself
out
of
my
bar
i
say
you
and
all
of
you
and
he
turned
the
fellows
out
i
then
asked
the
landlord
whether
he
would
permit
the
horse
to
remain
in
the
stable
for
a
short
time
provided
i
paid
for
his
entertainment
and
on
his
willingly
consenting
i
treated
my
friends
with
ale
and
then
returned
with
them
to
the
encampment
that
evening
i
informed
petulengro
and
his
party
that
on
the
morrow
i
intended
to
mount
my
horse
and
leave
that
part
of
the
country
in
quest
of
adventures
inquiring
of
jasper
where
in
the
event
of
my
selling
the
horse
advantageously
i
might
meet
with
him
and
repay
the
money
i
had
borrowed
of
him
whereupon
petulengro
informed
me
that
in
about
ten
weeks
i
might
find
him
at
a
certain
place
at
the
chong
gav
i
then
stated
that
as
i
could
not
well
carry
with
me
the
property
which
i
possessed
in
the
dingle
which
after
all
was
of
no
considerable
value
i
had
resolved
to
bestow
the
said
property
namely
the
pony
tent
tools
on
ursula
and
her
husband
partly
because
they
were
poor
and
partly
on
account
of
the
great
kindness
which
i
bore
to
ursula
from
whom
i
had
on
various
occasions
experienced
all
manner
of
civility
particularly
in
regard
to
crabbed
words
on
hearing
this
intelligence
ursula
returned
many
thanks
to
her
gentle
brother
as
she
called
me
and
sylvester
was
so
overjoyed
that
casting
aside
his
usual
phlegm
he
said
i
was
the
best
friend
he
had
ever
had
in
the
world
and
in
testimony
of
his
gratitude
swore
that
he
would
permit
his
wife
to
give
me
a
choomer
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
company
which
offer
however
met
with
a
very
mortifying
reception
the
company
frowning
disapprobation
ursula
protesting
against
anything
of
the
kind
and
i
myself
showing
no
forwardness
to
avail
myself
of
it
having
inherited
from
nature
a
considerable
fund
of
modesty
to
which
was
added
no
slight
store
acquired
in
the
course
of
my
irish
education
i
passed
that
night
alone
in
the
dingle
in
a
very
melancholy
manner
with
little
or
no
sleep
thinking
of
isopel
berners
and
in
the
morning
when
i
quitted
it
i
shed
several
tears
as
i
reflected
that
i
should
probably
never
again
see
the
spot
where
i
had
passed
so
many
hours
in
her
company
chapter
xx
farewell
to
the
romans
the
landlord
and
his
niece
set
out
as
a
traveller
on
reaching
the
plain
above
i
found
my
romany
friends
breakfasting
and
on
being
asked
by
petulengro
to
join
them
i
accepted
the
invitation
no
sooner
was
breakfast
over
than
i
informed
ursula
and
her
husband
that
they
would
find
the
property
which
i
had
promised
them
in
the
dingle
commending
the
little
pony
ambrol
to
their
best
care
i
took
leave
of
the
whole
company
which
was
itself
about
to
break
up
camp
and
to
depart
in
the
direction
of
london
and
made
the
best
of
my
way
to
the
house
i
had
a
small
bundle
in
my
hand
and
was
dressed
in
the
same
manner
as
when
i
departed
from
london
having
left
my
waggoner
slop
with
the
other
effects
in
the
dingle
on
arriving
at
the
i
informed
the
landlord
that
i
was
come
for
my
horse
inquiring
at
the
same
time
whether
he
could
not
accommodate
me
with
a
bridle
and
saddle
he
told
me
that
the
bridle
and
saddle
with
which
i
had
ridden
the
horse
on
the
preceding
day
were
at
my
service
for
a
trifle
that
he
had
received
them
some
time
since
in
payment
for
a
debt
and
that
he
had
himself
no
use
for
them
the
leathers
of
the
bridle
were
rather
shabby
and
the
bit
rusty
and
the
saddle
was
old
fashioned
but
i
was
happy
to
purchase
them
for
seven
shillings
more
especially
as
the
landlord
added
a
small
valise
which
he
said
could
be
strapped
to
the
saddle
and
which
i
should
find
very
convenient
for
carrying
my
things
in
i
then
proceeded
to
the
stable
told
the
horse
we
were
bound
on
an
expedition
and
giving
him
a
feed
of
corn
left
him
to
discuss
it
and
returned
to
the
to
have
a
little
farewell
chat
with
the
landlord
and
at
the
same
time
to
drink
with
him
a
farewell
glass
of
ale
whilst
we
were
talking
and
drinking
the
niece
came
and
joined
us
she
was
a
decent
sensible
young
woman
who
appeared
to
take
a
great
interest
in
her
uncle
whom
she
regarded
with
a
singular
mixture
of
pride
and
disapprobation
pride
for
the
renown
which
he
had
acquired
by
his
feats
of
old
and
disapprobation
for
his
late
imprudences
she
said
that
she
hoped
that
his
misfortunes
would
be
a
warning
to
him
to
turn
more
to
his
god
than
he
had
hitherto
done
and
to
give
up
and
other
life
practices
to
which
the
landlord
replied
that
with
respect
to
fighting
he
intended
to
give
it
up
entirely
being
determined
no
longer
to
risk
his
capital
upon
birds
and
with
respect
to
his
religious
duties
he
should
attend
the
church
of
which
he
was
churchwarden
at
least
once
a
quarter
adding
however
that
he
did
not
intend
to
become
either
canter
or
driveller
neither
of
which
characters
would
befit
a
publican
surrounded
by
such
customers
as
he
was
and
that
to
the
last
day
of
his
life
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
make
use
of
his
fists
after
a
stay
of
about
two
hours
i
settled
accounts
and
having
bridled
and
saddled
my
horse
and
strapped
on
my
valise
i
mounted
shook
hands
with
the
landlord
and
his
niece
and
departed
notwithstanding
that
they
both
entreated
me
to
tarry
until
the
evening
it
being
then
the
heat
of
the
day
chapter

an
adventure
on
the
road
the

flint
stone
a
rural
scene
mead
the
old
man
and
his
bees
i
bent
my
course
in
the
direction
of
the
north
more
induced
by
chance
than
any
particular
motive
all
quarters
of
the
world
having
about
equal
attractions
for
me
i
was
in
high
spirits
at
finding
myself
once
more
on
and
trotted
gaily
on
until
the
heat
of
the
weather
induced
me
to
slacken
my
pace
more
out
of
pity
for
my
horse
than
because
i
felt
any
particular
inconvenience
from
it
heat
and
cold
being
then
and
still
matters
of
great
indifference
to
me
what
i
thought
of
i
scarcely
know
save
and
except
that
i
have
a
glimmering
recollection
that
i
felt
some
desire
to
meet
with
one
of
those
adventures
which
upon
the
roads
of
england
are
generally
as
plentiful
as
blackberries
in
autumn
and
fortune
who
has
generally
been
ready
to
gratify
my
inclinations
provided
it
cost
her
very
little
by
so
doing
was
not
slow
in
furnishing
me
with
an
adventure
perhaps
as
characteristic
of
the
english
roads
as
anything
which
could
have
happened
i
might
have
travelled
about
six
miles
amongst
cross
roads
and
lanes
when
suddenly
i
found
myself
upon
a
broad
and
very
dusty
road
which
seemed
to
lead
due
north
as
i
wended
along
this
i
saw
a
man
upon
a
donkey
riding
towards
me
the
man
was
commonly
dressed
with
a
broad
felt
hat
on
his
head
and
a
kind
of
satchel
on
his
back
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
mighty
hurry
and
was
every
now
and
then
belabouring
the
donkey
with
a
cudgel
the
donkey
however
which
was
a
fine
large
creature
of
the
species
did
not
appear
to
sympathize
at
all
with
its
rider
in
his
desire
to
get
on
but
kept
its
head
turned
back
as
much
as
possible
moving
from
one
side
of
the
road
to
the
other
and
not
making
much
forward
way
as
i
passed
being
naturally
of
a
very
polite
disposition
i
gave
the
man
the
sele
of
the
day
asking
him
at
the
same
time
why
he
beat
the
donkey
whereupon
the
fellow
eyeing
me
askance
told
me
to
mind
my
own
business
with
the
addition
of
something
which
i
need
not
repeat
i
had
not
proceeded
a
furlong
before
i
saw
seated
on
the
dust
by
the
wayside
close
by
a
heap
of
stones
and
with
several
flints
before
him
a
old
man
with
a
straw
hat
and
a
white
smock
who
was
weeping
bitterly
what
are
you
crying
for
father
said
i
have
you
come
to
any
hurt
hurt
enough
sobbed
the
old
man
i
have
just
been
tricked
out
of
the
best
ass
in
england
by
a
villain
who
gave
me
nothing
but
these
trash
in
return
pointing
to
the
stones
before
him
i
really
scarcely
understand
you
said
i
i
wish
you
would
explain
yourself
more
clearly
i
was
riding
on
my
ass
from
market
said
the
old
man
when
i
met
here
a
fellow
with
a
sack
on
his
back
who
after
staring
at
the
ass
and
me
a
moment
or
two
asked
me
if
i
would
sell
her
i
told
him
that
i
could
not
think
of
selling
her
as
she
was
very
useful
to
me
and
though
an
animal
my
true
companion
whom
i
loved
as
much
as
if
she
were
my
wife
and
daughter
i
then
attempted
to
pass
on
but
the
fellow
stood
before
me
begging
me
to
sell
her
saying
that
he
would
give
me
anything
for
her
well
seeing
that
he
persisted
i
said
at
last
that
if
i
sold
her
i
must
have
six
pounds
for
her
and
i
said
so
to
get
rid
of
him
for
i
saw
that
he
was
a
shabby
fellow
who
had
probably
not
six
shillings
in
the
world
but
i
had
better
have
held
my
tongue
said
the
old
man
crying
more
bitterly
than
before
for
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
my
mouth
when
he
said
he
would
give
me
what
i
asked
and
taking
the
sack
from
his
back
he
pulled
out
a
steelyard
and
going
to
the
heap
of
stones
there
he
took
up
several
of
them
and
weighed
them
then
flinging
them
down
before
me
he
said
are
six
pounds
neighbour
now
get
off
the
ass
and
hand
her
over
to
me
well
i
sat
like
one
dumbfoundered
for
a
time
till
at
last
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
do
i
mean
said
he
old
rascal
why
i
mean
to
claim
my
purchase
and
then
he
swore
so
awfully
that
scarcely
knowing
what
i
did
i
got
down
and
he
jumped
on
the
animal
and
rode
off
as
fast
as
he
could
i
suppose
he
was
the
fellow
said
i
whom
i
just
now
met
upon
a
fine
gray
ass
which
he
was
beating
with
a
cudgel
i
dare
say
he
was
said
the
old
man
i
saw
him
beating
her
as
he
rode
away
and
i
thought
i
should
have
died
i
never
heard
such
a
story
said
i
well
do
you
mean
to
submit
to
such
a
piece
of
roguery
quietly
oh
dear
said
the
old
man
what
can
i
do
i
am
years
of
age
i
am
bad
on
my
feet
and
go
after
him
shall
i
go
said
i
the
fellow
is
a
thief
and
any
one
has
a
right
to
stop
him
oh
if
you
could
but
bring
her
again
to
me
said
the
old
man
i
would
bless
you
till
my
dying
day
but
have
a
care
i
do
know
but
after
all
the
law
may
say
that
she
is
his
lawful
purchase
i
asked
six
pounds
for
her
and
he
gave
me
six
pounds
six
flints
you
mean
said
i
no
no
the
law
is
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
either
i
know
something
about
her
and
am
sure
that
she
will
never
sanction
such
a
quibble
at
all
events
i
ride
after
the
fellow
thereupon
turning
my
horse
round
i
put
him
to
his
very
best
trot
i
rode
nearly
a
mile
without
obtaining
a
glimpse
of
the
fellow
and
was
becoming
apprehensive
that
he
had
escaped
me
by
turning
down
some
two
or
three
of
which
i
had
passed
suddenly
however
on
the
road
making
a
slight
turning
i
perceived
him
right
before
me
moving
at
a
tolerably
swift
pace
having
by
this
time
probably
overcome
the
resistance
of
the
animal
putting
my
horse
to
a
full
gallop
i
shouted
at
the
top
of
my
voice
get
off
that
donkey
you
rascal
and
give
her
up
to
me
or
ride
you
down
the
fellow
hearing
the
thunder
of
the
horse
hoofs
behind
him
drew
up
on
one
side
of
the
road
what
do
you
want
said
he
as
i
stopped
my
charger
now
almost
covered
with
sweat
and
foam
close
beside
him
do
you
want
to
rob
me
to
rob
you
said
i
no
but
to
take
from
you
that
ass
of
which
you
have
just
robbed
its
owner
i
have
robbed
no
man
said
the
fellow
i
just
now
purchased
it
fairly
of
its
master
and
the
law
will
give
it
to
me
he
asked
six
pounds
for
it
and
i
gave
him
six
pounds
six
stones
you
mean
you
rascal
said
i
get
down
or
my
horse
shall
be
upon
you
in
a
moment
then
with
a
motion
of
my
reins
i
caused
the
horse
to
rear
pressing
his
sides
with
my
heels
as
if
i
intended
to
make
him
leap
stop
said
the
man
i
get
down
and
then
try
if
i
ca
serve
you
out
he
then
got
down
and
confronted
me
with
his
cudgel
he
was
a
fellow
and
seemed
prepared
for
anything
scarcely
however
had
he
dismounted
when
the
donkey
jerked
the
bridle
out
of
his
hand
and
probably
in
revenge
for
the
usage
she
had
received
gave
him
a
pair
of
tremendous
kicks
on
the
hip
with
her
hinder
legs
which
overturned
him
and
then
scampered
down
the
road
the
way
she
had
come
pretty
treatment
this
said
the
fellow
getting
up
without
his
cudgel
and
holding
his
hand
to
his
side
i
wish
i
may
not
be
lamed
for
life
and
if
you
be
said
i
it
will
merely
serve
you
right
you
rascal
for
trying
to
cheat
a
poor
old
man
out
of
his
property
by
quibbling
at
words
rascal
said
the
fellow
you
lie
i
am
no
rascal
and
as
for
quibbling
with
words
suppose
i
did
what
then
all
the
first
people
does
it
the
newspapers
does
it
the
gentlefolks
that
calls
themselves
the
guides
of
the
popular
mind
does
it
i
no
ignoramus
i
read
the
newspapers
and
knows
what
what
you
read
them
to
some
purpose
said
i
well
if
you
are
lamed
for
life
and
unfitted
for
any
active
line
turn
newspaper
editor
i
should
say
you
are
perfectly
qualified
and
this
day
adventure
may
be
the
foundation
of
your
fortune
thereupon
i
turned
round
and
rode
off
the
fellow
followed
me
with
a
torrent
of
abuse
confound
you
said
he
yet
that
was
not
the
expression
either
i
know
you
you
are
one
of
the
come
down
into
the
country
on
leave
to
see
your
relations
confound
you
you
and
the
like
of
you
have
knocked
my
business
on
the
head
near
lunnon
and
i
suppose
we
shall
have
you
shortly
in
the
country
to
the
newspaper
office
said
i
and
fabricate
falsehoods
out
of
flint
stones
then
touching
the
horse
with
my
heels
i
trotted
off
and
coming
to
the
place
where
i
had
seen
the
old
man
i
found
him
there
risen
from
the
ground
and
embracing
his
ass
i
told
him
that
i
was
travelling
down
the
road
and
said
that
if
his
way
lay
in
the
same
direction
as
mine
he
could
do
no
better
than
accompany
me
for
some
distance
lest
the
fellow
who
for
aught
i
knew
might
be
hovering
nigh
might
catch
him
alone
and
again
get
his
ass
from
him
after
thanking
me
for
my
offer
which
he
said
he
would
accept
he
got
upon
his
ass
and
we
proceeded
together
down
the
road
my
new
acquaintance
said
very
little
of
his
own
accord
and
when
i
asked
him
a
question
answered
rather
incoherently
i
heard
him
every
now
and
then
say
villain
to
himself
after
which
he
would
pat
the
donkey
neck
from
which
circumstance
i
concluded
that
his
mind
was
occupied
with
his
late
adventure
after
travelling
about
two
miles
we
reached
a
place
where
a
on
the
right
led
from
the
great
road
here
my
companion
stopped
and
on
my
asking
him
whether
he
was
going
any
farther
he
told
me
that
the
path
to
the
right
was
the
way
to
his
home
i
was
bidding
him
farewell
when
he
hemmed
once
or
twice
and
said
that
as
he
did
not
live
far
off
he
hoped
that
i
would
go
with
him
and
taste
some
of
his
mead
as
i
had
never
tasted
mead
of
which
i
had
frequently
read
in
the
compositions
of
the
welsh
bards
and
moreover
felt
rather
thirsty
from
the
heat
of
the
day
i
told
him
that
i
should
have
great
pleasure
in
attending
him
whereupon
turning
off
together
we
proceeded
about
half
a
mile
sometimes
between
stone
walls
and
at
other
times
hedges
till
we
reached
a
small
hamlet
through
which
we
passed
and
presently
came
to
a
very
pretty
cottage
delightfully
situated
within
a
garden
surrounded
by
a
hedge
of
woodbines
opening
a
gate
at
one
corner
of
the
garden
he
led
the
way
to
a
large
shed
which
stood
partly
behind
the
cottage
which
he
said
was
his
stable
thereupon
he
dismounted
and
led
his
donkey
into
the
shed
which
was
without
stalls
but
had
a
long
rack
and
manger
on
one
side
he
tied
his
donkey
after
taking
off
her
caparisons
and
i
followed
his
example
tying
my
horse
at
the
other
side
with
a
rope
halter
which
he
gave
me
he
then
asked
me
to
come
in
and
taste
his
mead
but
i
told
him
that
i
must
attend
to
the
comfort
of
my
horse
first
and
forthwith
taking
a
wisp
of
straw
rubbed
him
carefully
down
then
taking
a
pailful
of
clear
water
which
stood
in
the
shed
i
allowed
the
horse
to
drink
about
half
a
pint
and
then
turning
to
the
old
man
who
all
the
time
had
stood
by
looking
at
my
proceedings
i
asked
him
whether
he
had
any
oats
i
have
all
kinds
of
grain
he
replied
and
going
out
he
presently
returned
with
two
measures
one
a
large
and
the
other
a
small
one
both
filled
with
oats
mixed
with
a
few
beans
and
handing
the
large
one
to
me
for
the
horse
he
emptied
the
other
before
the
donkey
who
before
she
began
to
despatch
it
turned
her
nose
to
her
master
face
and
fairly
kissed
him
having
given
my
horse
his
portion
i
told
the
old
man
that
i
was
ready
to
taste
his
mead
as
soon
as
he
pleased
whereupon
he
ushered
me
into
his
cottage
where
making
me
sit
down
by
a
deal
table
in
a
neatly
sanded
kitchen
he
produced
from
an
fashioned
closet
a
bottle
holding
about
a
quart
and
a
couple
of
cups
which
might
each
contain
about
half
a
pint
then
opening
the
bottle
and
filling
the
cups
with
a
liquor
he
handed
one
to
me
and
taking
a
seat
opposite
to
me
he
lifted
the
other
nodded
and
saying
to
me
health
and
welcome
placed
it
to
his
lips
and
drank
health
and
thanks
i
replied
and
being
very
thirsty
emptied
my
cup
at
a
draught
i
had
scarcely
done
so
however
when
i
half
repented
the
mead
was
deliciously
sweet
and
mellow
but
appeared
strong
as
brandy
my
eyes
reeled
in
my
head
and
my
brain
became
slightly
dizzy
mead
is
a
strong
drink
said
the
old
man
as
he
looked
at
me
with
a
half
smile
on
his
countenance
this
is
at
any
rate
said
i
so
strong
indeed
that
i
would
not
drink
another
cup
for
any
consideration
and
i
would
not
ask
you
said
the
old
man
for
if
you
did
you
would
most
probably
be
stupid
all
day
and
wake
the
next
morning
with
a
headache
mead
is
a
good
drink
but
woundily
strong
especially
to
those
who
be
not
used
to
it
as
i
suppose
you
are
not
where
do
you
get
it
said
i
i
make
it
myself
said
the
old
man
from
the
honey
which
my
bees
make
have
you
many
bees
i
inquired
a
great
many
said
the
old
man
and
do
you
keep
them
said
i
for
the
sake
of
making
mead
with
their
honey
i
keep
them
he
replied
partly
because
i
am
fond
of
them
and
partly
for
what
they
bring
me
in
they
make
me
a
great
deal
of
honey
some
of
which
i
sell
and
with
a
little
i
make
some
mead
to
warm
my
poor
heart
with
or
occasionally
to
treat
a
friend
with
like
yourself
and
do
you
support
yourself
entirely
by
means
of
your
bees
no
said
the
old
man
i
have
a
little
bit
of
ground
behind
my
house
which
is
my
principal
means
of
support
and
do
you
live
alone
yes
said
he
with
the
exception
of
the
bees
and
the
donkey
i
live
quite
alone
and
have
you
always
lived
alone
the
old
man
emptied
his
cup
and
his
heart
being
warmed
with
the
mead
he
told
his
history
which
was
simplicity
itself
his
father
was
a
small
yeoman
who
at
his
death
had
left
him
his
only
child
the
cottage
with
a
small
piece
of
ground
behind
it
and
on
this
little
property
he
had
lived
ever
since
about
the
age
of
five
he
had
married
an
industrious
young
woman
by
whom
he
had
one
daughter
who
died
before
reaching
years
of
womanhood
his
wife
however
had
survived
her
daughter
many
years
and
had
been
a
great
comfort
to
him
assisting
him
in
his
rural
occupations
but
about
four
years
before
the
present
period
he
had
lost
her
since
which
time
he
had
lived
alone
making
himself
as
comfortable
as
he
could
cultivating
his
ground
with
the
help
of
a
lad
from
the
neighbouring
village
attending
to
his
bees
and
occasionally
riding
his
donkey
to
market
and
hearing
the
word
of
god
which
he
said
he
was
sorry
he
could
not
read
twice
a
week
regularly
at
the
parish
church
such
was
the
old
man
tale
when
he
had
finished
speaking
he
led
me
behind
his
house
and
showed
me
his
little
domain
it
consisted
of
about
two
acres
in
admirable
cultivation
a
small
portion
of
it
formed
a
kitchen
garden
while
the
rest
was
sown
with
four
kinds
of
grain
wheat
barley
peas
and
beans
the
air
was
full
of
ambrosial
sweets
resembling
those
proceeding
from
an
orange
grove
a
place
which
though
i
had
never
seen
at
that
time
i
since
have
in
the
garden
was
the
habitation
of
the
bees
a
long
box
supported
upon
three
oaken
stumps
it
was
full
of
small
round
glass
windows
and
appeared
to
be
divided
into
a
great
many
compartments
much
resembling
drawers
placed
sideways
he
told
me
that
as
one
compartment
was
filled
the
bees
left
it
for
another
so
that
whenever
he
wanted
honey
he
could
procure
some
without
injury
to
the
insects
through
the
little
round
windows
i
could
see
several
of
the
bees
at
work
hundreds
were
going
in
and
out
of
the
doors
hundreds
were
buzzing
about
on
the
flowers
the
woodbines
and
beans
as
i
looked
around
on
the
field
the
garden
and
the
bees
i
thought
i
had
never
before
seen
so
rural
and
peaceful
a
scene
when
we
returned
to
the
cottage
we
again
sat
down
and
i
asked
the
old
man
whether
he
was
not
afraid
to
live
alone
he
told
me
that
he
was
not
for
that
upon
the
whole
his
neighbours
were
very
kind
to
him
i
mentioned
the
fellow
who
had
swindled
him
of
his
donkey
upon
the
road
that
was
no
neighbour
of
mine
said
the
old
man
and
perhaps
i
shall
never
see
him
again
or
his
like
it
a
dreadful
thing
said
i
to
have
no
other
resource
when
injured
than
to
shed
tears
on
the
road
it
is
so
said
the
old
man
but
god
saw
the
tears
of
the
old
and
sent
a
helper
why
did
you
not
help
yourself
said
i
instead
of
getting
off
your
ass
why
did
you
not
punch
at
the
fellow
or
at
any
rate
use
dreadful
language
call
him
villain
and
shout
robbery
punch
said
the
old
man
shout
what
with
these
hands
and
this
voice
lord
how
you
run
on
i
am
old
young
chap
i
am
old
well
said
i
it
is
a
shameful
thing
to
cry
even
when
old
you
think
so
now
said
the
old
man
because
you
are
young
and
strong
perhaps
when
you
are
as
old
as
i
you
will
not
be
ashamed
to
cry
upon
the
whole
i
was
rather
pleased
with
the
old
man
and
much
with
all
about
him
as
evening
drew
nigh
i
told
him
that
i
must
proceed
on
my
journey
whereupon
he
invited
me
to
tarry
with
him
during
the
night
telling
me
that
he
had
a
nice
room
and
bed
above
at
my
service
i
however
declined
and
bidding
him
farewell
mounted
my
horse
and
departed
regaining
the
road
i
proceeded
once
more
in
the
direction
of
the
north
and
after
a
few
hours
coming
to
a
comfortable
i
stopped
and
put
up
for
the
night
chapter
xxii
the
singular
noise
sleeping
in
a
meadow
the
book
cure
for
wakefulness
literary
tea
party
poor
byron
i
did
not
awake
till
rather
late
the
next
morning
and
when
i
did
i
felt
considerable
drowsiness
with
a
slight
headache
which
i
was
uncharitable
enough
to
attribute
to
the
mead
which
i
had
drunk
on
the
preceding
day
after
feeding
my
horse
and
breakfasting
i
proceeded
on
my
wanderings
nothing
occurred
worthy
of
relating
till
was
considerably
past
when
i
came
to
a
pleasant
valley
between
two
gentle
hills
i
had
dismounted
in
order
to
ease
my
horse
and
was
leading
him
along
by
the
bridle
when
on
my
right
behind
a
bank
in
which
some
umbrageous
ashes
were
growing
heard
a
singular
noise
i
stopped
short
and
listened
and
presently
said
to
myself
surely
this
is
snoring
perhaps
that
of
a
hedgehog
on
further
consideration
however
i
was
convinced
that
the
noise
which
i
heard
and
which
certainly
seemed
to
be
snoring
could
not
possibly
proceed
from
the
nostrils
of
so
small
an
animal
but
must
rather
come
from
those
of
a
giant
so
loud
and
sonorous
was
it
about
two
or
three
yards
farther
was
a
gate
partly
open
to
which
i
went
and
peeping
into
the
field
saw
a
man
lying
on
some
rich
grass
under
the
shade
of
one
of
the
ashes
he
was
snoring
away
at
a
great
rate
impelled
by
curiosity
i
fastened
the
bridle
of
my
horse
to
the
gate
and
went
up
to
the
man
he
was
a
individual
rather
corpulent
with
dark
features
and
seemingly
about
he
lay
on
his
back
his
hat
slightly
over
his
brow
and
at
his
right
hand
lay
an
open
book
so
strenuously
did
he
snore
that
the
wind
from
his
nostrils
agitated
perceptibly
a
fine
cambric
frill
which
he
wore
at
his
bosom
i
gazed
upon
him
for
some
time
expecting
that
he
might
awake
but
he
did
not
but
kept
on
snoring
his
breast
heaving
convulsively
at
last
the
noise
he
made
became
so
terrible
that
i
felt
alarmed
for
his
safety
imagining
that
a
fit
might
seize
him
and
he
lose
his
life
while
fast
asleep
i
therefore
exclaimed
sir
sir
awake
you
sleep
but
my
voice
failed
to
rouse
him
and
he
continued
snoring
as
before
whereupon
i
touched
him
slightly
with
my
riding
wand
but
failing
to
wake
him
i
touched
him
again
more
vigorously
whereupon
he
opened
his
eyes
and
probably
imagining
himself
in
a
dream
closed
them
again
but
i
was
determined
to
arouse
him
and
cried
as
loud
as
i
could
sir
sir
pray
sleep
no
more
he
heard
what
i
said
opened
his
eyes
again
stared
at
me
with
a
look
of
some
consciousness
and
half
raising
himself
upon
his
elbows
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
i
beg
your
pardon
said
i
but
i
took
the
liberty
of
awaking
you
because
you
appeared
to
be
much
disturbed
in
your
sleep
i
was
fearful
too
that
you
might
catch
a
fever
from
sleeping
under
a
tree
i
run
no
risk
said
the
man
i
often
come
and
sleep
here
and
as
for
being
disturbed
in
my
sleep
i
felt
very
comfortable
i
wish
you
had
not
awoke
me
well
said
i
i
beg
your
pardon
once
more
i
assure
you
that
what
i
did
was
with
the
best
intention
oh
pray
make
no
further
apology
said
the
individual
i
make
no
doubt
that
what
you
did
was
done
kindly
but
there
an
old
proverb
to
the
effect
you
should
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
he
added
with
a
smile
then
getting
up
and
stretching
himself
with
a
yawn
he
took
up
his
book
and
said
i
have
slept
quite
long
enough
and
it
quite
time
for
me
to
be
going
home
excuse
my
curiosity
said
i
if
i
inquire
what
may
induce
you
to
come
and
sleep
in
this
meadow
to
tell
you
the
truth
answered
he
i
am
a
bad
sleeper
pray
pardon
me
said
i
if
i
tell
you
that
i
never
saw
one
sleep
more
heartily
if
i
did
so
said
the
individual
i
am
beholden
to
this
meadow
and
this
book
but
i
am
talking
riddles
and
will
explain
myself
i
am
the
owner
of
a
very
pretty
property
of
which
this
valley
forms
part
some
years
ago
however
up
started
a
person
who
said
the
property
was
his
a
lawsuit
ensued
and
i
was
on
the
brink
of
losing
my
all
when
most
unexpectedly
the
suit
was
determined
in
my
favour
owing
however
to
the
anxiety
to
which
my
mind
had
been
subjected
for
several
years
my
nerves
had
become
terribly
shaken
and
no
sooner
was
the
trial
terminated
than
sleep
forsook
my
pillow
i
sometimes
passed
nights
without
closing
an
eye
i
took
opiates
but
they
rather
increased
than
alleviated
my
malady
about
three
weeks
ago
a
friend
of
mine
put
this
book
into
my
hand
and
advised
me
to
take
it
every
day
to
some
pleasant
part
of
my
estate
and
try
and
read
a
page
or
two
assuring
me
if
i
did
that
i
should
infallibly
fall
asleep
i
took
his
advice
and
selecting
this
place
which
i
considered
the
pleasantest
part
of
my
property
i
came
and
lying
down
commenced
reading
the
book
and
before
finishing
a
page
was
in
a
dead
slumber
every
day
since
then
i
have
repeated
the
experiment
and
every
time
with
equal
success
i
am
a
single
man
without
any
children
and
yesterday
i
made
my
will
in
which
in
the
event
of
my
friend
surviving
me
i
have
left
him
all
my
fortune
in
gratitude
for
his
having
procured
for
me
the
most
invaluable
of
all
blessings
sleep
dear
me
said
i
how
very
extraordinary
do
you
think
that
your
going
to
sleep
is
caused
by
the
meadow
or
the
book
i
suppose
by
both
said
my
new
acquaintance
acting
in
it
may
be
so
said
i
the
magic
influence
does
certainly
not
proceed
from
the
meadow
alone
for
since
i
have
been
here
i
have
not
felt
the
slightest
inclination
to
sleep
does
the
book
consist
of
prose
or
poetry
it
consists
of
poetry
said
the
individual
not
byron
said
i
byron
repeated
the
individual
with
a
smile
of
contempt
no
no
there
is
nothing
narcotic
in
byron
poetry
i
do
like
it
i
used
to
read
it
but
it
thrilled
agitated
and
kept
me
awake
no
this
is
not
poetry
but
the
inimitable
mentioning
a
name
which
i
had
never
heard
till
then
will
you
permit
me
to
look
at
it
said
i
with
pleasure
he
answered
politely
handing
me
the
book
i
took
the
volume
and
glanced
over
the
contents
it
was
written
in
blank
verse
and
appeared
to
abound
in
descriptions
of
scenery
there
was
much
mention
of
mountains
valleys
streams
and
waterfalls
harebells
and
daffodils
these
descriptions
were
interspersed
with
dialogues
which
though
they
proceeded
from
the
mouths
of
pedlars
and
rustics
were
of
the
most
edifying
description
mostly
on
subjects
moral
or
metaphysical
and
couched
in
the
most
gentlemanly
and
unexceptionable
language
without
the
slightest
mixture
of
vulgarity
coarseness
or
grammar
such
appeared
to
me
to
be
the
contents
of
the
book
but
before
i
could
form
a
very
clear
idea
of
them
i
found
myself
nodding
and
a
surprising
desire
to
sleep
coming
over
me
rousing
myself
however
by
a
strong
effort
i
closed
the
book
and
returning
it
to
the
owner
inquired
of
him
whether
he
had
any
motive
in
coming
and
lying
down
in
the
meadow
besides
the
wish
of
enjoying
sleep
none
whatever
he
replied
indeed
i
should
be
very
glad
not
to
be
compelled
to
do
so
always
provided
i
could
enjoy
the
blessing
of
sleep
for
by
lying
down
under
trees
i
may
possibly
catch
the
rheumatism
or
be
stung
by
serpents
and
moreover
in
the
rainy
season
and
winter
the
thing
will
be
impossible
unless
i
erect
a
tent
which
will
possibly
destroy
the
charm
well
said
i
you
need
give
yourself
no
further
trouble
about
coming
here
as
i
am
fully
convinced
that
with
this
book
in
your
hand
you
may
go
to
sleep
anywhere
as
your
friend
was
doubtless
aware
though
he
wished
to
interest
your
imagination
for
a
time
by
persuading
you
to
lie
abroad
therefore
in
future
whenever
you
feel
disposed
to
sleep
try
to
read
the
book
and
you
will
be
sound
asleep
in
a
minute
the
narcotic
influence
lies
in
the
book
and
not
in
the
field
i
will
follow
your
advice
said
the
individual
and
this
very
night
take
it
with
me
to
bed
though
i
hope
in
time
to
be
able
to
sleep
without
it
my
nerves
being
already
much
quieted
from
the
slumbers
i
have
enjoyed
in
this
field
he
then
moved
towards
the
gate
where
we
parted
he
going
one
way
and
i
and
my
horse
the
other
more
than
twenty
years
subsequent
to
this
period
after
much
wandering
about
the
world
returning
to
my
native
country
i
was
invited
to
a
literary
where
the
discourse
turning
upon
poetry
i
in
order
to
show
that
i
was
not
more
ignorant
than
my
neighbours
began
to
talk
about
byron
for
whose
writings
i
really
entertained
considerable
admiration
though
i
had
no
particular
esteem
for
the
man
himself
at
first
i
received
no
answer
to
what
i
said
the
company
merely
surveying
me
with
a
kind
of
sleepy
stare
at
length
a
lady
about
the
age
of
forty
with
a
large
wart
on
her
face
observed
in
a
drawling
tone
that
she
had
not
read
byron
at
least
since
her
girlhood
and
then
only
a
few
passages
but
that
the
impression
on
her
mind
was
that
his
writings
were
of
a
highly
objectionable
character
i
also
read
a
little
of
him
in
my
boyhood
said
a
gentleman
about
sixty
but
who
evidently
from
his
dress
and
demeanour
wished
to
appear
about
thirty
but
i
highly
disapproved
of
him
for
notwithstanding
he
was
a
nobleman
he
is
frequently
very
coarse
and
very
fond
of
raising
emotion
now
emotion
is
what
i
dislike
drawling
out
the
last
syllable
of
the
word
dislike
there
is
only
one
poet
for
me
the
divine
and
then
he
mentioned
a
name
which
i
had
only
once
heard
and
afterwards
quite
forgotten
the
same
mentioned
by
the
snorer
in
the
field
ah
there
is
no
one
like
him
murmured
some
more
of
the
company
the
poet
of
nature
of
nature
without
its
vulgarity
i
wished
very
much
to
ask
these
people
whether
they
were
ever
bad
sleepers
and
whether
they
had
read
the
poet
so
called
from
a
desire
of
being
set
to
sleep
within
a
few
days
however
i
learnt
that
it
had
of
late
become
very
fashionable
and
genteel
to
appear
half
asleep
and
that
one
could
exhibit
no
better
mark
of
superfine
breeding
than
by
occasionally
in
company
setting
one
rhomal
organ
in
action
i
then
ceased
to
wonder
at
the
popularity
which
i
found
nearly
universal
of
poetry
for
certainly
in
order
to
make
one
self
appear
sleepy
in
company
or
occasionally
to
induce
sleep
nothing
could
be
more
efficacious
than
a
slight
prelection
of
his
poems
so
poor
byron
with
his
fire
and
emotion
to
say
nothing
of
his
mouthings
and
coxcombry
was
dethroned
as
i
prophesied
he
would
be
more
than
twenty
years
before
on
the
day
of
his
funeral
though
i
had
little
idea
that
his
humiliation
would
have
been
brought
about
by
one
whose
sole
strength
consists
in
setting
people
to
sleep
well
all
things
are
doomed
to
terminate
in
sleep
before
that
termination
however
i
will
venture
to
prophesy
that
people
will
become
a
little
more
awake
snoring
and
yawning
be
a
little
less
in
fashion
and
poor
byron
be
once
more
reinstated
on
his
throne
though
his
rival
will
always
stand
a
good
chance
of
being
worshipped
by
those
whose
ruined
nerves
are
insensible
to
the
narcotic
powers
of
opium
and
morphine
chapter
xxiii
drivers
and
front
outside
passengers
fatigue
of
body
and
mind
unexpected
greeting
my
inn
the
governor
engagement
i
continued
my
journey
passing
through
one
or
two
villages
the
day
was
exceedingly
hot
and
the
roads
dusty
in
order
to
cause
my
horse
as
little
fatigue
as
possible
and
not
to
chafe
his
back
i
led
him
by
the
bridle
my
doing
which
brought
upon
me
a
shower
of
remarks
jests
and
witticisms
from
the
drivers
and
front
outside
passengers
of
sundry
which
passed
me
in
one
direction
or
the
other
in
this
way
i
proceeded
till
considerably
past
noon
when
i
felt
myself
very
fatigued
and
my
horse
appeared
no
less
so
and
it
is
probable
that
the
lazy
and
listless
manner
in
which
we
were
moving
on
tired
us
both
much
more
effectually
than
hurrying
along
at
a
swift
trot
would
have
done
for
i
have
observed
that
when
the
energies
of
the
body
are
not
exerted
a
languor
frequently
comes
over
it
at
length
arriving
at
a
very
large
building
with
an
archway
near
the
entrance
of
a
town
i
sat
down
on
what
appeared
to
be
a
and
presently
experienced
a
great
depression
of
spirits
i
began
to
ask
myself
whither
i
was
going
and
what
i
should
do
with
myself
and
the
horse
which
i
held
by
the
bridle
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
was
alone
in
the
world
with
the
poor
animal
who
looked
for
support
to
me
who
knew
not
how
to
support
myself
then
the
image
of
isopel
berners
came
into
my
mind
and
when
i
thought
how
i
had
lost
her
for
ever
and
how
happy
i
might
have
been
with
her
in
the
new
world
had
she
not
deserted
me
i
became
yet
more
miserable
as
i
sat
in
this
state
of
mind
i
suddenly
felt
some
one
clap
me
on
the
shoulder
and
heard
a
voice
say
ha
comrade
of
the
dingle
what
chance
has
brought
you
into
these
parts
i
turned
round
and
beheld
a
man
in
the
dress
of
a
postillion
whom
i
instantly
recognized
as
he
to
whom
i
had
rendered
assistance
on
the
night
of
the
storm
ah
said
i
is
it
you
i
am
glad
to
see
you
for
i
was
feeling
very
lonely
and
melancholy
lonely
and
melancholy
he
replied
how
is
that
how
can
any
one
be
lonely
and
melancholy
with
such
a
noble
horse
as
that
you
hold
by
the
bridle
the
horse
said
i
is
one
cause
of
my
melancholy
for
i
know
not
in
the
world
what
to
do
with
it
it
is
your
own
yes
said
i
i
may
call
it
my
own
though
i
borrowed
the
money
to
purchase
it
well
why
do
you
sell
it
it
is
not
always
easy
to
find
a
purchaser
for
a
horse
like
this
said
i
can
you
recommend
me
one
i
why
no
not
exactly
but
you
find
a
purchaser
shortly
pooh
if
you
have
no
other
cause
for
disquiet
than
that
horse
cheer
up
man
do
be
cast
down
have
you
nothing
else
on
your
mind
by
the
bye
what
become
of
the
young
woman
you
were
keeping
company
with
in
that
queer
lodging
place
of
yours
she
has
left
me
said
i
you
quarrelled
i
suppose
no
said
i
we
did
not
exactly
quarrel
but
we
are
parted
well
replied
he
but
you
will
soon
come
together
again
no
said
i
we
are
parted
for
ever
for
ever
pooh
you
little
know
how
people
sometimes
come
together
again
who
think
they
are
parted
for
ever
here
something
on
that
point
relating
to
myself
you
remember
when
i
told
you
my
story
in
that
dingle
of
yours
that
i
mentioned
a
young
woman
my
when
i
lived
with
the
english
family
in
mumbo
jumbo
town
and
how
she
and
i
when
our
foolish
governors
were
thinking
of
changing
their
religion
agreed
to
stand
by
each
other
and
be
true
to
old
church
of
england
and
to
give
our
governors
warning
provided
they
tried
to
make
us
renegades
well
she
and
i
parted
soon
after
that
and
never
to
meet
again
yet
we
met
the
other
day
in
the
fields
for
she
lately
came
to
live
with
a
great
family
not
far
from
here
and
we
have
since
agreed
to
marry
to
take
a
little
farm
for
we
have
both
a
trifle
of
money
and
live
together
till
us
do
part
so
much
for
parting
for
ever
but
what
do
i
mean
by
keeping
you
broiling
in
the
sun
with
your
horse
bridle
in
your
hand
and
you
on
my
own
ground
do
you
know
where
you
are
why
that
great
house
is
my
inn
that
is
it
my
master
the
best
fellow
in
come
along
you
and
your
horse
both
will
find
a
welcome
at
my
inn
thereupon
he
led
the
way
into
a
large
court
in
which
there
were
coaches
chaises
and
a
great
many
people
taking
my
horse
from
me
he
led
it
into
a
nice
cool
stall
and
fastened
it
to
the
rack
he
then
conducted
me
into
a
postillion
which
at
that
time
chanced
to
be
empty
and
he
then
fetched
a
pot
of
beer
and
sat
down
by
me
after
a
little
conversation
he
asked
me
what
i
intended
to
do
and
i
told
him
frankly
that
i
did
not
know
whereupon
he
observed
that
provided
i
had
no
objection
he
had
little
doubt
that
i
could
be
accommodated
for
some
time
at
his
inn
our
upper
ostler
said
he
died
about
a
week
ago
he
was
a
clever
fellow
and
besides
his
trade
understood
reading
and
accounts
dear
me
said
i
interrupting
him
i
am
not
fitted
for
the
place
of
ostler
moreover
i
refused
the
place
of
ostler
at
a
which
was
offered
to
me
only
a
few
days
ago
the
postillion
burst
into
a
laugh
ostler
at
a
indeed
why
you
would
not
compare
a
berth
at
a
place
like
that
with
the
situation
of
ostler
at
my
inn
the
first
in
england
however
i
was
not
thinking
of
the
place
of
ostler
for
you
you
are
as
you
say
not
fitted
for
it
at
any
rate
not
at
a
house
like
this
we
have
moreover
the
best
in
all
england
old
bill
with
the
drawback
that
he
is
rather
fond
of
drink
we
could
make
shift
with
him
very
well
provided
we
could
fall
in
with
a
man
of
writing
and
figures
who
could
give
an
account
of
the
hay
and
corn
which
comes
in
and
goes
out
and
would
object
to
give
a
look
occasionally
at
the
yard
now
it
appears
to
me
that
you
are
just
such
a
kind
of
man
and
if
you
will
allow
me
to
speak
to
the
governor
i
doubt
that
he
will
gladly
take
you
as
he
feels
kindly
disposed
towards
you
from
what
he
has
heard
me
say
concerning
you
and
what
should
i
do
with
my
horse
said
i
the
horse
need
give
you
no
uneasiness
said
the
postillion
i
know
he
will
be
welcome
here
both
for
bed
and
manger
and
perhaps
in
a
little
time
you
may
find
a
purchaser
as
a
vast
number
of
sporting
people
frequent
this
house
i
offered
two
or
three
more
objections
which
the
postillion
overcame
with
great
force
of
argument
and
the
pot
being
nearly
empty
he
drained
it
to
the
bottom
drop
and
then
starting
up
left
me
alone
in
about
twenty
minutes
he
returned
accompanied
by
a
highly
looking
individual
dressed
in
blue
and
black
with
a
particularly
white
cravat
and
without
a
hat
on
his
head
this
individual
whom
i
should
have
mistaken
for
a
gentleman
but
for
the
intelligence
depicted
in
his
face
he
introduced
to
me
as
the
master
of
the
inn
the
master
of
the
inn
shook
me
warmly
by
the
hand
told
me
that
he
was
happy
to
see
me
in
his
house
and
thanked
me
in
the
handsomest
terms
for
the
kindness
i
had
shown
to
his
servant
in
the
affair
of
the
thunderstorm
then
saying
that
he
was
informed
i
was
out
of
employ
he
assured
me
that
he
should
be
most
happy
to
engage
me

that
with
respect
to
the

he
was

i

begged
to
inform
me
that
i
was
perfectly
at
liberty
to
keep
it
at
the
inn
upon
the
very
best
until
i
could
find
a
purchaser
that
with
regard
to
wages
but
he
had
no
sooner
mentioned
wages
than
i
cut
him
short
saying
that
provided
i
stayed
i
should
be
most
happy
to
serve
him
for
bed
and
board
and
requested
that
he
would
allow
me
until
the
next
morning
to
consider
of
his
offer
he
willingly
consented
to
my
request
and
begging
that
i
would
call
for
anything
i
pleased
left
me
alone
with
the
postillion
i
passed
that
night
until
about
ten
with
the
postillion
when
he
left
me
having
to
drive
a
family
about
ten
miles
across
the
country
before
his
departure
however
i
told
him
that
i
had
determined
to
accept
the
offer
of
his
governor
as
he
called
him
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
was
most
happy
that
an
offer
had
been
made
which
secured
to
myself
and
the
animal
a
comfortable
retreat

very
great
place
for
life

was
this
inn
and
often
in
after
life
when
lonely
and
melancholy
i
have
called
up
the
time
i
spent
there
and
never
failed
to
become
cheerful
from
the
recollection
i
found
the
master
of
the
house
a
very
kind
and
civil
person
before
being
an
he
had
been
in
some
other
line
of
business
but
on
the
death
of
the
former
proprietor
of
the
inn
had
married
his
widow
who
was
still
alive
but
being
somewhat
infirm
lived
in
a
retired
part
of
the
house
i
have
said
that
he
was
kind
and
civil
he
was
however
not
one
of
those
people
who
suffer
themselves
to
be
made
fools
of
by
anybody
he
knew
his
customers
and
had
a
calm
clear
eye
which
would
look
through
a
man
without
seeming
to
do
so
the
accommodation
of
his
house
was
of
the
very
best
description
his
wines
were
good
his
viands
equally
so
and
his
charges
not
immoderate
though
he
very
properly
took
care
of
himself
he
was
no
vulgar
had
a
host
of
friends
and
deserved
them
all
during
the
time
i
lived
with
him
he
was
presented
by
a
large
assemblage
of
his
friends
and
customers
with
a
dinner
at
his
own
house
which
was
very
costly
and
at
which
the
best
of
wines
were
sported
and
after
the
dinner
with
a
piece
of
plate
estimated
at
fifty
guineas
he
received
the
plate
made
a
neat
speech
of
thanks
and
when
the
bill
was
called
for
made
another
neat
speech
in
which
he
refused
to
receive
one
farthing
for
the
entertainment
ordering
in
at
the
same
time
two
dozen
more
of
the
best
champagne
and
sitting
down
amidst
uproarious
applause
and
cries
of
you
shall
be
no
loser
by
it
nothing
very
wonderful
in
such
conduct
some
people
will
say
i
do
say
there
is
nor
have
i
any
intention
to
endeavour
to
persuade
the
reader
that
the
landlord
was
a
carlo
boromeo
he
merely
gave
a
quid
pro
quo
but
it
is
not
every
person
who
will
give
you
a
quid
pro
quo
had
he
been
a
vulgar
publican
he
would
have
sent
in
a
swinging
bill
after
receiving
the
plate
but
then
no
vulgar
publican
would
have
been
presented
with
plate
perhaps
not
but
many
a
vulgar
public
character
has
been
presented
with
plate
whose
admirers
never
received
a
quid
pro
quo
except
in
the
shape
of
a
swinging
bill
i
found
my
duties
of
distributing
hay
and
corn
and
keeping
an
account
thereof
anything
but
disagreeable
particularly
after
i
had
acquired
the
of
the
old
ostler
who
at
first
looked
upon
me
with
rather
an
evil
eye
considering
me
somewhat
in
the
light
of
one
who
had
usurped
an
office
which
belonged
to
himself
by
the
right
of
succession
but
there
was
little
gall
in
the
old
fellow
and
by
speaking
kindly
to
him
never
giving
myself
any
airs
of
assumption
but
above
all
by
frequently
reading
the
newspapers
to
him
for
though
passionately
fond
of
news
and
politics
he
was
unable
to
read
i
soon
succeeded
in
placing
myself
on
excellent
terms
with
him
a
regular
character
was
that
old
ostler
he
was
a
yorkshireman
by
birth
but
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
life
in
the
vicinity
of
london
to
which
on
the
death
of
his
parents
who
were
very
poor
people
he
went
at
a
very
early
age
amongst
other
places
where
he
had
served
as
ostler
was
a
small
inn
at
hounslow
much
frequented
by
highwaymen
whose
exploits
he
was
fond
of
narrating
especially
those
of
jerry
abershaw
who
he
said
was
a
capital
rider
and
on
hearing
his
accounts
of
that
worthy
i
half
regretted
that
the
old
fellow
had
not
been
in
london
and
i
had
not
formed
his
acquaintance
about
the
time
i
was
thinking
of
writing
the
life
of
the
said
abershaw
not
doubting
that
with
his
assistance
i
could
have
produced
a
book
at
least
as
remarkable
as
the
life
and
adventures
of
that
entirely
imaginary
personage
joseph
sell
perhaps
however
i
was
mistaken
and
whenever
abershaw
life
shall
appear
before
the
public
and
my
publisher
credibly
informs
me
that
it
has
not
yet
appeared
i
beg
and
entreat
the
public
to
state
which
it
likes
best
the
life
of
abershaw
or
that
of
sell
for
which
latter
work
i
am
informed
that
during
the
last
few
months
there
has
been
a
prodigious
demand
my
old
friend
however
after
talking
of
abershaw
would
frequently
add
that
good
rider
as
abershaw
certainly
was
he
was
decidedly
inferior
to
richard
ferguson
generally
called
galloping
dick
who
was
a
pal
of
abershaw
and
had
enjoyed
a
career
as
long
and
nearly
as
remarkable
as
his
own
i
learned
from
him
that
both
were
capital
customers
at
the
hounslow
inn
and
that
he
had
frequently
drank
with
them
in
the
he
said
that
no
man
could
desire
more
jolly
or
entertaining
companions
over
a
glass
of
summut
but
that
upon
the
road
it
was
anything
but
desirable
to
meet
them
there
they
were
terrible
cursing
and
swearing
and
thrusting
the
muzzles
of
their
pistols
into
people
mouths
and
at
this
part
of
his
locution
the
old
man
winked
and
said
in
a
somewhat
lower
voice
that
upon
the
whole
they
were
right
in
doing
so
and
that
when
a
person
had
once
made
up
his
mind
to
become
a
highwayman
his
best
policy
was
to
go
the
whole
hog
fearing
nothing
but
making
everybody
afraid
of
him
that
people
never
thought
of
resisting
a
highwayman
and
if
he
were
taken
were
afraid
to
bear
witness
against
him
lest
he
should
get
off
and
cut
their
throats
some
time
or
other
upon
the
roads
whereas
people
would
resist
being
robbed
by
a
sneaking
rascal
and
would
swear
bodily
against
him
on
the
first
opportunity
adding
that
abershaw
and
ferguson
two
most
awful
fellows
had
enjoyed
a
long
career
whereas
two
disbanded
officers
of
the
army
who
wished
to
rob
a
coach
like
gentlemen
had
begged
the
passengers
pardon
and
talked
of
hard
necessity
had
been
set
upon
by
the
passengers
themselves
amongst
whom
were
three
women
pulled
from
their
horses
conducted
to
maidstone
and
hanged
with
as
little
pity
as
such
contemptible
fellows
deserved
there
is
nothing
like
going
the
whole
hog
he
repeated
and
if
ever
i
had
been
a
highwayman
i
would
have
done
so
i
should
have
thought
myself
all
the
more
safe
and
moreover
should
have
despised
myself
to
curry
favour
with
those
you
are
robbing
sometimes
at
the
expense
of
your
own
comrades
as
i
have
known
fellows
do
why
it
is
the
greatest
so
it
is
interposed
my
friend
the
postillion
who
chanced
to
be
present
at
a
considerable
part
of
the
old
ostler
discourse
it
is
as
you
say
the
greatest
of
humbug
and
merely
after
all
gets
a
fellow
into
trouble
but
no
regular
bred
highwayman
would
do
it
i
say
george
catch
the
pope
of
rome
trying
to
curry
favour
with
anybody
he
robs
catch
old
mumbo
jumbo
currying
favour
with
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
the
dean
and
chapter
should
he
meet
them
in
a
it
would
be
with
him
bricconi
abbasso
as
he
knocked
their
teeth
out
with
the
butt
of
his
trombone
and
the
old
ruffian
would
be
all
the
safer
for
it
as
bill
would
say
as
ten
to
one
the
archbishop
and
chapter
after
such
a
spice
of
his
quality
would
be
afraid
to
swear
against
him
and
to
hang
him
even
if
he
were
in
their
power
though
that
would
be
the
proper
way
for
if
it
is
the
greatest
of
all
humbug
for
a
highwayman
to
curry
favour
with
those
he
robs
the
next
greatest
is
to
try
to
curry
favour
with
a
highwayman
when
you
have
got
him
by
letting
him
off
finding
the
old
man
so
well
acquainted
with
the
history
of
highwaymen
and
taking
considerable
interest
in
the
subject
having
myself
edited
a
book
containing
the
lives
of
many
remarkable
people
who
had
figured
on
the
highway
i
forthwith
asked
him
how
it
was
that
the
trade
of
highwaymen
had
become
extinct
in
england
as
at
present
we
never
heard
of
any
one
following
it
whereupon
he
told
me
that
many
causes
had
contributed
to
bring
about
that
result
the
principal
of
which
were
the
following
the
refusal
to
license
houses
which
were
known
to
afford
shelter
to
highwaymen
which
amongst
many
others
had
caused
the
inn
at
hounslow
to
be
closed
the
inclosure
of
many
a
wild
heath
in
the
country
on
which
they
were
in
the
habit
of
lurking
and
particularly
the
establishing
in
the
neighbourhood
of
london
of
a
mounted
patrol
who
rode
the
highwaymen
down
and
delivered
them
up
to
justice
which
hanged
them
without
ceremony
and
that
would
be
the
way
to
deal
with
mumbo
jumbo
and
his
gang
said
the
postillion
should
they
show
their
visages
in
these
realms
and
i
hear
by
the
newspapers
that
they
are
becoming
every
day
more
desperate
take
away
the
license
from
their
cut
down
the
rookeries
and
shadowy
old
avenues
in
which
they
are
fond
of
lying
in
wait
in
order
to
sally
out
upon
people
as
they
pass
in
the
roads
but
above
all
establish
a
good
mounted
police
to
ride
after
the
ruffians
and
drag
them
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
to
the
next
clink
where
they
might
lie
till
they
could
be
properly
dealt
with
by
law
instead
of
which
the
government
are
repealing
the
wise
old
laws
enacted
against
such
characters
giving
fresh
licenses
every
day
to
their
and
saying
that
it
would
be
a
pity
to
cut
down
their
rookeries
and
thickets
because
they
look
so
very
picturesque
and
in
fact
giving
them
all
kind
of
encouragement
why
if
such
behaviour
is
not
enough
to
drive
an
honest
man
mad
i
know
not
what
is
it
is
of
no
use
talking
i
only
wish
the
power
were
in
my
hands
and
if
i
did
not
make
short
work
of
them
might
i
be
a
mere
jackass
postillion
all
the
remainder
of
my
life
besides
acquiring
from
the
ancient
ostler
a
great
deal
of
curious
information
respecting
the
ways
and
habits
of
the
heroes
of
the
road
with
whom
he
had
come
in
contact
in
the
early
portion
of
his
life
i
picked
up
from
him
many
excellent
hints
relating
to
the
art
of
grooming
horses
whilst
at
the
inn
i
frequently
groomed
the
stage
and
and
those
driven
up
by
travellers
in
their
gigs
i
was
not
compelled
nor
indeed
expected
to
do
so
but
i
took
pleasure
in
the
occupation
and
i
remember
at
that
period
one
of
the
principal
objects
of
my
ambition
was
to
be
a
groom
and
to
make
the
skins
of
the
creatures
i
took
in
hand
look
sleek
and
glossy
like
those
of
moles
i
have
said
that
i
derived
valuable
hints
from
the
old
man
and
indeed
became
a
very
tolerable
groom
but
there
was
a
certain
finishing
touch
which
i
could
never
learn
from
him
though
he
possessed
it
himself
and
which
i
could
never
attain
to
by
my
own
endeavours
though
my
want
of
success
certainly
did
not
proceed
from
want
of
application
for
i
have
rubbed
the
horses
down
purring
and
buzzing
all
the
time
after
the
genuine
ostler
fashion
until
the
perspiration
fell
in
heavy
drops
upon
my
shoes
and
when
i
had
done
my
best
and
asked
the
old
fellow
what
he
thought
of
my
work
i
could
never
extract
from
him
more
than
a
kind
of
grunt
which
might
be
translated
not
so
very
bad
but
i
have
seen
a
horse
groomed
much
better
which
leads
me
to
suppose
that
a
person
in
order
to
be
a
groom
must
have
something
in
him
when
he
is
born
which
i
had
not
and
indeed
which
many
other
people
have
not
who
pretend
to
be
grooms

lest

promise
the
reader
shall
have
it
now
i
shall
never
forget
an
harangue
from
the
mouth
of
the
old
man
which
i
listened
to
one
warm
evening
as
he
and
i
sat
on
the
threshold
of
the
stable
after
having
attended
to
some
of
the
wants
of
a
batch
of
horses
it
related
to
the
manner
in
which
a
gentleman
should
take
care
of
his
horse
and
self
whilst
engaged
in
a
journey
on
horseback
and
was
addressed
to
myself
on
the
supposition
of
my
one
day
coming
to
an
estate
and
of
course
becoming
a
gentleman
when

are

much

than

bye
how
you
ever
came
by
it
you
ca
do
better
than
follow
the
advice
i
am
about
to
give
you
both
with
respect
to
your
animal
and
yourself
before
you
start
merely
give
your
horse
a
couple
of
handfuls
of
corn
and
a
little
water
somewhat
under
a
quart
and
if
you
drink
a
pint
of
water
yourself
out
of
the
pail
you
will
feel
all
the
better
during
the
whole
day
then
you
may
walk
and
trot
your
animal
for
about
ten
miles
till
you
come
to
some
nice
inn
where
you
may
get
down
and
see
your
horse
led
into
a
nice
stall
telling
the
ostler
not
to
feed
him
till
you
come
if
the
ostler
happens
to
be
a
and
has
an
english
like
that
of
mine
there
say
what
a
nice
dog
it
is
and
praise
its
black
and
tawn
and
if
he
does
not
happen
to
be
a
ask
him
how
getting
on
and
whether
he
ever
knew
worse
times
that
kind
of
thing
will
please
the
ostler
and
he
will
let
you
do
just
what
you
please
with
your
own
horse
and
when
your
back
is
turned
he
say
to
his
comrades
what
a
nice
gentleman
you
are
and
how
he
thinks
he
has
seen
you
before
then
go
and
sit
down
to
breakfast
and
before
you
have
finished
breakfast
get
up
and
go
and
give
your
horse
a
feed
of
corn
chat
with
the
ostler
two
or
three
minutes
till
your
horse
has
taken
the
shine
out
of
his
corn
which
will
prevent
the
ostler
taking
any
of
it
away
when
your
back
is
turned
for
such
things
are
sometimes
done
not
that
i
ever
did
such
a
thing
myself
when
i
was
at
the
inn
at
hounslow
oh
dear
me
no
then
go
and
finish
your
breakfast
and
when
you
have
finished
your
breakfast
and
called
for
the
newspaper
go
and
water
your
horse
letting
him
have
one
pailful
then
give
him
another
feed
of
corn
and
enter
into
discourse
with
the
ostler
about
the
prime
minister
and
the
like
and
when
your
horse
has
once
more
taken
the
shine
out
of
his
corn
go
back
to
your
room
and
your
newspaper
and
i
hope
for
your
sake
it
may
be
the
for
that
the
best
paper
going
then
pull
the
and
order
in
your
bill
which
you
will
pay
without
counting
it
up
supposing
you
to
be
a
gentleman
give
the
waiter
sixpence
and
order
out
your
horse
and
when
your
horse
is
out
pay
for
the
corn
and
give
the
ostler
a
shilling
then
mount
your
horse
and
walk
him
gently
for
five
miles
and
whilst
you
are
walking
him
in
this
manner
it
may
be
as
well
to
tell
you
to
take
care
that
you
do
not
let
him
down
and
smash
his
knees
more
especially
if
the
road
be
a
particularly
good
one
for
it
is
not
at
a
desperate
hiverman
pace
and
over
very
bad
roads
that
a
horse
tumbles
and
smashes
his
knees
but
on
your
particularly
nice
road
when
the
horse
is
going
gently
and
lazily
and
is
half
asleep
like
the
gemman
on
his
back
well
at
the
end
of
the
five
miles
when
the
horse
has
digested
his
food
and
is
all
right
you
may
begin
to
push
your
horse
on
trotting
him
a
mile
at
a
heat
and
then
walking
him
a
quarter
of
a
one
that
his
wind
may
be
not
distressed
and
you
may
go
on
in
that
way
for
thirty
miles
never
galloping
of
course
for
none
but
fools
or
hivermen
ever
gallop
horses
on
roads
and
at
the
end
of
that
distance
you
may
stop
at
some
other
nice
inn
to
dinner
i
say
when
your
horse
is
led
into
the
stable
after
that
same
thirty
miles
trotting
and
walking
do
let
the
saddle
be
whisked
off
at
once
for
if
you
do
your
horse
will
have
such
a
sore
back
as
will
frighten
you
but
let
your
saddle
remain
on
your
back
with
the
girths
loosened
till
after
his
next
feed
of
corn
and
be
sure
that
he
has
no
corn
much
less
water
till
after
a
long
hour
and
more
after
he
is
fed
he
may
be
watered
to
the
tune
of
half
a
pail
and
then
the
ostler
can
give
him
a
regular
rub
down
you
may
then
sit
down
to
dinner
and
when
you
have
dined
get
up
and
see
to
your
horse
as
you
did
after
breakfast
in
fact
you
must
do
much
after
the
same
fashion
you
did
at
inn
see
to
your
horse
and
by
no
means
disoblige
the
ostler
so
when
you
have
seen
to
your
horse
a
second
time
you
will
sit
down
to
your
bottle
of
wine
supposing
you
to
be
a
gentleman
and
after
you
have
finished
it
and
your
argument
about
the
with
any
commercial
gentleman
who
happens
to
be
in
the
room
you
may
mount
your
horse
again
not
forgetting
to
do
the
proper
thing
to
the
waiter
and
ostler
you
may
mount
your
horse
again
and
ride
him
as
you
did
before
for
about
five
and
twenty
miles
at
the
end
of
which
you
may
put
up
for
the
night
after
a
very
fair
day
journey
for
no
gentleman
supposing
he
weighs
sixteen
stone
as
i
suppose
you
will
by
the
time
you
become
a
gentleman
ought
to
ride
a
horse
more
than
miles
in
one
day
provided
he
has
any
regard
for
his
horse
back
or
his
own
either
see
to
your
horse
at
night
and
have
him
well
rubbed
down
the
next
day
you
may
ride
your
horse
forty
miles
just
as
you
please
but
never
foolishly
and
those
forty
miles
will
bring
you
to
your
journey
end
unless
your
journey
be
a
plaguy
long
one
and
if
so
never
ride
your
horse
more
than
five
and
thirty
miles
a
day
always
however
seeing
him
well
fed
and
taking
more
care
of
him
than
yourself
which
is
but
right
and
reasonable
seeing
as
how
the
horse
is
the
best
animal
of
the
two
when
you
are
a
gentleman
said
he
after
a
pause
the
first
thing
you
must
think
about
is
to
provide
yourself
with
a
good
horse
for
your
own
particular
riding
you
will
perhaps
keep
a
coach
and
pair
but
they
will
be
less
your
own
than
your
lady
should
you
have
one
and
your
young
gentry
should
you
have
any
or
if
you
have
neither
for
madam
your
housekeeper
and
the
upper
female
servants
so
you
need
trouble
your
head
less
about
them
though
of
course
you
would
not
like
to
pay
away
your
money
for
screws
but
be
sure
you
get
a
good
horse
for
your
own
riding
and
that
you
may
have
a
good
chance
of
having
a
good
one
buy
one
that
young
and
has
plenty
of
belly
a
little
more
than
the
one
has
which
you
now
have
though
you
are
not
yet
a
gentleman
you
will
of
course
look
to
his
head
his
withers
legs
and
other
points
but
never
buy
a
horse
at
any
price
that
has
not
plenty
of
belly
no
horse
that
has
not
belly
is
ever
a
good
feeder
and
a
horse
that
a
good
feeder
ca
be
a
good
horse
never
buy
a
horse
that
is
drawn
up
in
the
belly
behind
a
horse
of
that
description
ca
feed
and
can
never
carry
sixteen
stone
so
when
you
have
got
such
a
horse
be
proud
of
it
as
i
daresay
you
are
of
the
one
you
have
now
and
wherever
you
go
swear
there
another
to
match
it
in
the
country
and
if
anybody
gives
you
the
lie
take
him
by
the
nose
and
tweak
it
off
just
as
you
would
do
if
anybody
were
to
speak
ill
of
your
lady
or
for
want
of
her
of
your
housekeeper
take
care
of
your
horse
as
you
would
of
the
apple
of
your
eye
i
am
sure
i
would
if
i
were
a
gentleman
which
i
do
ever
expect
to
be
and
hardly
wish
seeing
as
how
i
am
and
am
rather
too
old
to
ride
yes
cherish
and
take
care
of
your
horse
as
perhaps
the
best
friend
you
have
in
the
world
for
after
all
who
will
carry
you
through
thick
and
thin
as
your
horse
will
not
your
gentlemen
friends
i
warrant
nor
your
upper
servants
male
or
female
perhaps
your
lady
would
that
is
if
she
is
a
whopper
and
one
of
the
right
sort
the
others
would
be
more
likely
to
take
up
mud
and
pelt
you
with
it
provided
they
saw
you
in
trouble
than
to
help
you
so
take
care
of
your
horse
and
feed
him
every
day
with
your
own
hands
give
him
three
quarters
of
a
peck
of
corn
each
day
mixed
up
with
a
little
and
allow
him
besides
one
hundredweight
of
hay
in
the
course
of
the
week
some
say
that
the
hay
should
be
hardland
hay
because
it
is
the
wholesomest
but
i
say
let
it
be
clover
hay
because
the
horse
likes
it
best
give
him
through
summer
and
winter
once
a
week
a
pailful
of
bran
mash
cold
in
summer
and
in
winter
hot
ride
him
gently
about
the
neighbourhood
every
day
by
which
means
you
will
give
exercise
to
yourself
and
horse
and
moreover
have
the
satisfaction
of
exhibiting
yourself
and
your
horse
to
advantage
and
hearing
perhaps
the
men
say
what
a
fine
horse
and
the
ladies
saying
what
a
fine
man
never
let
your
groom
mount
your
horse
as
it
is
ten
to
one
if
you
do
your
groom
will
be
wishing
to
show
off
before
company
and
will
fling
your
horse
down
i
was
groom
to
a
gemman
before
i
went
to
the
inn
at
hounslow
and
flung
him
a
horse
down
worth
ninety
guineas
by
endeavouring
to
show
off
before
some
ladies
that
i
met
on
the
road
turn
your
horse
out
to
grass
throughout
may
and
the
first
part
of
june
for
then
the
grass
is
sweetest
and
the
flies
do
sting
so
bad
as
they
do
later
in
summer
afterwards
merely
turn
him
out
occasionally
in
the
swale
of
the
morn
and
the
evening
after
september
the
grass
is
good
for
little
lash
and
sour
at
best
every
horse
should
go
out
to
grass
if
not
his
blood
becomes
full
of
greasy
humours
and
his
wind
is
apt
to
become
affected
but
he
ought
to
be
kept
as
much
as
possible
from
the
heat
and
flies
always
got
up
at
night
and
never
turned
out
late
in
the
year
lord
if
i
had
always
such
a
nice
attentive
person
to
listen
to
me
as
you
are
i
could
go
on
talking
about
to
the
end
of
time
chapter
xxvi
the
stage
coachmen
of
england
a
bully
served
out
broughton
guard
the
brazen
head
i
lived
on
very
good
terms
not
only
with
the
master
and
the
old
ostler
but
with
all
the
domestics
and
hangers
on
at
the
inn
waiters
chambermaids
cooks
and
scullions
not
forgetting
the
boots
of
which
there
were
three
as
for
the
postillions
i
was
sworn
brother
with
them
all
and
some
of
them
went
so
far
as
to
swear
that
i
was
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
for
which
high
opinion
entertained
by
them
of
me
i
believe
i
was
principally
indebted
to
the
good
account
their
comrade
gave
of
me
whom
i
had
so
hospitably
received
in
the
dingle
i
repeat
that
i
lived
on
good
terms
with
all
the
people
connected
with
the
inn
and
was
noticed
and
spoken
kindly
to
by
some
of
the
guests
especially
by
that
class
termed
commercial
travellers
all
of
whom
were
great
friends
and
patronizers
of
the
landlord
and
were
the
principal
promoters
of
the
dinner
and
subscribers
to
the
gift
of
plate
which
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
whole
fraternity
striking
me
as
the
jolliest
set
of
fellows
imaginable
the
best
customers
to
an
inn
and
the
most
liberal
to
servants
there
was
one
description
of
persons
however
frequenting
the
inn
which
i
did
not
like
at
all
and
which
i
did
not
get
on
well
with
and
these
people
were
the
the
of
england
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
speaking
considered
themselves
mighty
fine
gentry
nay
i
verily
believe
the
most
important
personages
of
the
realm
and
their
entertaining
this
high
opinion
of
themselves
can
scarcely
be
wondered
at
they
were
low
fellows
but
masters
at
driving
driving
was
in
fashion
and
sprigs
of
nobility
used
to
dress
as
coachmen
and
imitate
the
slang
and
behaviour
of
the
coachmen
from
whom
occasionally
they
would
take
lessons
in
driving
as
they
sat
beside
them
on
the
box
which
post
of
honour
any
sprig
of
nobility
who
happened
to
take
a
place
on
a
coach
claimed
as
his
unquestionable
right
and
these
sprigs
would
smoke
cigars
and
drink
sherry
with
the
coachmen
in
and
on
the
road
and
when
bidding
them
farewell
would
give
them
a
guinea
or
a
and
shake
them
by
the
hand
so
that
these
fellows
being
low
fellows
very
naturally
thought
no
small
liquor
of
themselves
but
would
talk
familiarly
of
their
friends
lords
so
and
so
the
honourable
misters
so
and
so
and
sir
harry
and
sir
charles
and
be
wonderfully
saucy
to
any
one
who
was
not
a
lord
or
something
of
the
kind
and
this
high
opinion
of
themselves
received
daily
augmentation
from
the
servile
homage
paid
them
by
the
generality
of
the
untitled
male
passengers
especially
those
on
the
fore
part
of
the
coach
who
used
to
contend
for
the
honour
of
sitting
on
the
box
with
the
coachman
when
no
sprig
was
nigh
to
put
in
his
claim
oh
what
servile
homage
these
craven
creatures
did
pay
these
same
coach
fellows
more
especially
after
witnessing
this
or
act
of
brutality
practised
upon
the
weak
and
unoffending
upon
some
poor
friendless
woman
travelling
with
but
little
money
and
perhaps
a
brace
of
hungry
children
with
her
or
upon
some
thin
and
man
travelling
on
the
hind
part
of
the
coach
from
london
to
liverpool
with
only
eighteen
pence
in
his
pocket
after
his
fare
was
paid
to
defray
his
expenses
on
the
road
for
as
the
insolence
of
these
knights
was
vast
so
was
their
rapacity
enormous
they
had
been
so
long
accustomed
to
have
crowns
and
rained
upon
them
by
their
admirers
and
flatterers
that
they
would
look
at
a
shilling
for
which
many
an
honest
labourer
was
happy
to
toil
for
ten
hours
under
a
broiling
sun
with
the
utmost
contempt
would
blow
upon
it
derisively
or
fillip
it
into
the
air
before
they
pocketed
it
but
when
nothing
was
given
them
as
would
occasionally
happen
for
how
could
they
receive
from
those
who
had
nothing
and
nobody
was
bound
to
give
them
anything
as
they
had
certain
wages
from
their
employers
then
what
a
scene
would
ensue
truly
the
brutality
and
rapacious
insolence
of
english
coachmen
had
reached
a
climax
it
was
time
that
these
fellows
should
be
disenchanted
and
the
time
thank
heaven
was
not
far
distant
let
the
craven
dastards
who
used
to
curry
favour
with
them
and
applaud
their
brutality
lament
their
loss
now
that
they
and
their
vehicles
have
disappeared
from
the
roads
i
who
have
ever
been
an
enemy
to
insolence
cruelty
and
tyranny
loathe
their
memory
and
what
is
more
am
not
afraid
to
say
so
well
aware
of
the
storm
of
vituperation
partly
learnt
from
them
which
i
may
expect
from
those
who
used
to
fall
down
and
worship
them
amongst
the
coachmen
who
frequented
the
inn
was
one
who
was
called
the
coachman
he
drove
to
our
inn
in
the
fore
part
of
every
day
one
of
what
were
called
the
fast
coaches
and
afterwards
took
back
the
corresponding
vehicle
he
stayed
at
our
house
about
twenty
minutes
during
which
time
the
passengers
of
the
coach
which
he
was
to
return
with
dined
those
at
least
who
were
inclined
for
dinner
and
could
pay
for
it
he
derived
his
sobriquet
of
the
coachman
partly
from
his
being
dressed
in
the
extremity
of
coach
dandyism
and
partly
from
the
peculiar
insolence
of
his
manner
and
the
unmerciful
fashion
in
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
lashing
on
the
poor
horses
committed
to
his
charge
he
was
a
large
tall
fellow
of
about
thirty
with
a
face
which
had
it
not
been
bloated
by
excess
and
insolence
and
cruelty
stamped
most
visibly
upon
it
might
have
been
called
his
insolence
indeed
was
so
great
that
he
was
hated
by
all
the
minor
fry
connected
with
coaches
along
the
road
upon
which
he
drove
especially
the
ostlers
whom
he
was
continually
abusing
or
finding
fault
with
many
was
the
hearty
curse
which
he
received
when
his
back
was
turned
but
the
generality
of
people
were
much
afraid
of
him
for
he
was
a
swinging
strong
fellow
and
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
fighter
and
in
one
or
two
instances
had
beaten
in
a
barbarous
manner
individuals
who
had
quarrelled
with
him
i
was
nearly
having
a
fracas
with
this
worthy
one
day
after
he
had
been
drinking
sherry
with
a
sprig
he
swaggered
into
the
yard
where
i
happened
to
be
standing
just
then
a
waiter
came
by
carrying
upon
a
tray
part
of
a
splendid
cheshire
cheese
with
a
knife
plate
and
napkin
stopping
the
waiter
the
coachman
cut
with
the
knife
a
tolerably
large
lump
out
of
the
very
middle
of
the
cheese
stuck
it
on
the
end
of
the
knife
and
putting
it
to
his
mouth
nibbled
a
slight
piece
off
it
and
then
tossing
the
rest
away
with
disdain
flung
the
knife
down
upon
the
tray
motioning
the
waiter
to
proceed
i
wish
said
i
you
may
not
want
before
you
die
what
you
have
just
flung
away
whereupon
the
fellow
turned
furiously
towards
me
just
then
however
his
coach
being
standing
at
the
door
there
was
a
cry
for
coachman
so
that
he
was
forced
to
depart
contenting
himself
for
the
present
with
shaking
his
fist
at
me
and
threatening
to
serve
me
out
on
the
first
opportunity
before
however
the
opportunity
occurred
he
himself
got
served
out
in
a
most
unexpected
manner
the
day
after
this
incident
he
drove
his
coach
to
the
inn
and
after
having
dismounted
and
received
the
contributions
of
the
generality
of
the
passengers
he
strutted
up
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
to
an
individual
who
had
come
with
him
and
who
had
just
asked
me
a
question
with
respect
to
the
direction
of
a
village
about
three
miles
off
to
which
he
was
going
remember
the
coachman
said
the
knight
of
the
box
to
this
individual
who
was
a
thin
person
of
about
sixty
with
a
white
hat
rather
shabby
black
coat
and
trousers
and
who
held
an
umbrella
and
a
small
bundle
in
his
hand
if
you
expect
me
to
give
you
anything
said
he
to
the
coachman
you
are
mistaken
i
will
give
you
nothing
you
have
been
very
insolent
to
me
as
i
rode
behind
you
on
the
coach
and
have
encouraged
two
or
three
trumpery
fellows
who
rode
along
with
you
to
cut
scurvy
jokes
at
my
expense
and
now
you
come
to
me
for
money
i
am
not
so
poor
but
i
could
have
given
you
a
shilling
had
you
been
civil
as
it
is
i
will
give
you
nothing
oh
you
wo
you
said
the
coachman
dear
me
i
hope
i
sha
starve
because
you
wo
give
me
anything
a
shilling
why
i
could
afford
to
give
you
twenty
if
i
thought
fit
you
pauper
civil
to
you
indeed
things
are
come
to
a
fine
pass
if
i
need
be
civil
to
you
do
you
know
who
you
are
speaking
to
why
the
best
lords
in
the
country
are
proud
to
speak
to
me
why
it
was
only
the
other
day
that
the
marquis
of
said
to
me
and
then
he
went
on
to
say
what
the
marquis
said
to
him
after
which
flinging
down
his
cigar
he
strutted
up
the
road
swearing
to
himself
about
paupers
you
say
it
is
three
miles
to
said
the
individual
to
me
i
think
i
shall
light
my
pipe
and
smoke
it
as
i
go
along
thereupon
he
took
out
from
a
a
and
short
meerschaum
pipe
and
implements
for
striking
a
light
filled
his
pipe
lighted
it
and
commenced
smoking
presently
the
coachman
drew
near
i
saw
at
once
that
there
was
mischief
in
his
eye
the
man
smoking
was
standing
with
his
back
towards
him
and
he
came
so
nigh
to
him
seemingly
purposely
that
as
he
passed
a
puff
of
smoke
came
of
necessity
against
his
face
what
do
you
mean
by
smoking
in
my
face
said
he
striking
the
pipe
of
the
elderly
individual
out
of
his
mouth
the
other
without
manifesting
much
surprise
said
i
thank
you
and
if
you
will
wait
a
minute
i
will
give
you
a
receipt
for
that
favour
then
gathering
up
his
pipe
and
taking
off
his
coat
and
hat
he
laid
them
on
a
which
stood
near
and
rubbing
his
hands
together
he
advanced
towards
the
coachman
in
an
attitude
of
offence
holding
his
hands
crossed
very
near
to
his
face
the
coachman
who
probably
expected
anything
but
such
a
movement
from
a
person
of
the
age
and
appearance
of
the
individual
whom
he
had
insulted
stood
for
a
moment
motionless
with
surprise
but
recollecting
himself
he
pointed
at
him
derisively
with
his
finger
the
next
moment
however
the
other
was
close
upon
him
had
struck
aside
the
extended
hand
with
his
left
fist
and
given
him
a
severe
blow
on
the
nose
with
his
right
which
he
immediately
followed
by
a
blow
in
the
eye
then
drawing
his
body
slightly
backward
with
the
velocity
of
lightning
he
struck
the
coachman
full
in
the
mouth
and
the
last
blow
was
the
severest
of
all
for
it
cut
the
coachman
lips
nearly
through
blows
so
quickly
and
sharply
dealt
i
had
never
seen
the
coachman
reeled
like
a
in
a
gale
and
seemed
nearly
unsensed
ho
what
this
a
fight
a
fight
sounded
from
a
dozen
voices
and
people
came
running
from
all
directions
to
see
what
was
going
on
the
coachman
coming
somewhat
to
himself
disencumbered
himself
of
his
coat
and
hat
and
encouraged
by
two
or
three
of
his
brothers
of
the
whip
showed
some
symptoms
of
fighting
endeavouring
to
close
with
his
foe
but
the
attempt
was
vain
for
his
foe
was
not
to
be
closed
with
he
did
not
shift
or
dodge
about
but
warded
off
the
blows
of
his
opponent
with
the
greatest
always
using
the
guard
which
i
have
already
described
and
putting
in
in
return
short
chopping
blows
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
in
a
very
few
minutes
the
countenance
of
the
coachman
was
literally
cut
to
pieces
and
several
of
his
teeth
were
dislodged
at
length
he
gave
in
stung
with
mortification
however
he
repented
and
asked
for
another
round
it
was
granted
to
his
own
complete
demolition
the
coachman
did
not
drive
his
coach
back
that
day
he
did
not
appear
on
the
box
again
for
a
week
but
he
never
held
up
his
head
afterwards
before
i
quitted
the
inn
he
had
disappeared
from
the
road
going
no
one
knew
where
the
coachman
as
i
have
said
before
was
very
much
disliked
upon
the
road
but
there
was
an
esprit
de
corps
amongst
the
coachmen
and
those
who
stood
by
did
not
like
to
see
their
brother
chastised
in
such
tremendous
fashion
i
never
saw
such
a
fight
before
said
one
fight
why
i
do
call
it
a
fight
at
all
this
chap
here
got
a
scratch
whereas
tom
is
cut
to
pieces
it
is
all
along
of
that
guard
of
his
if
tom
could
have
got
within
his
guard
he
would
have
soon
served
the
old
chap
out
so
he
would
said
another
it
was
all
owing
to
that
guard
however
i
think
i
see
into
it
and
if
i
had
not
to
drive
this
afternoon
i
would
have
a
turn
with
the
old
fellow
and
soon
serve
him
out
i
will
fight
him
now
for
a
guinea
said
the
other
coachman
half
taking
off
his
coat
observing
however
that
the
elderly
individual
made
a
motion
towards
him
he
hitched
it
upon
his
shoulder
again
and
added
that
is
if
he
had
not
been
fighting
already
but
as
it
is
i
am
above
taking
an
advantage
especially
of
such
a
poor
old
creature
as
that
and
when
he
had
said
this
he
looked
around
him
and
there
was
a
feeble
titter
of
approbation
from
two
or
three
of
the
craven
crew
who
were
in
the
habit
of
currying
favour
with
the
coachmen
the
elderly
individual
looked
for
a
moment
at
these
last
and
then
said
to
such
fellows
as
you
i
have
nothing
to
say
then
turning
to
the
coachmen
and
as
for
you
he
said
ye
cowardly
bullies
i
have
but
one
word
which
is
that
your
reign
upon
the
roads
is
nearly
over
and
that
a
time
is
coming
when
ye
will
no
longer
be
wanted
or
employed
in
your
present
capacity
when
ye
will
either
have
to
drive
assist
as
ostlers
at
village
or
rot
in
the
workhouse
then
putting
on
his
coat
and
hat
and
taking
up
his
bundle
not
forgetting
his
meerschaum
and
the
rest
of
his
smoking
apparatus
he
departed
on
his
way
filled
with
curiosity
i
followed
him
i
am
quite
astonished
that
you
should
be
able
to
use
your
hands
in
the
way
you
have
done
said
i
as
i
walked
with
this
individual
in
the
direction
in
which
he
was
bound
i
will
tell
you
how
i
became
able
to
do
so
said
the
elderly
individual
proceeding
to
fill
and
light
his
pipe
as
he
walked
along
my
father
was
a
journeyman
engraver
who
lived
in
a
very
riotous
neighbourhood
in
the
outskirts
of
london
wishing
to
give
me
something
of
an
education
he
sent
me
to
a
two
or
three
streets
distant
from
where
we
lived
and
there
being
rather
a
puny
boy
i
suffered
much
persecution
from
my
schoolfellows
who
were
a
very
blackguard
set
one
day
as
i
was
running
home
with
one
of
my
tormentors
pursuing
me
old
sergeant
broughton
the
retired
seized
me
by
the
arm
dear
me
said
i
has
it
ever
been
your
luck
to
be
acquainted
with
sergeant
broughton
you
may
well
call
it
luck
said
the
elderly
individual
but
for
him
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
make
my
way
through
the
world
he
lived
only
four
doors
from
our
house
so
as
i
was
running
along
the
street
with
my
tyrant
behind
me
sergeant
broughton
seized
me
by
the
arm
my
boy
said
he
have
frequently
seen
that
scamp
you
now
i
will
teach
you
how
to
send
him
home
with
a
bloody
nose
down
with
your
bag
of
books
and
now
my
game
chick
whispered
he
to
me
placing
himself
between
me
and
my
adversary
so
that
he
could
not
observe
his
motions
your
fist
in
this
manner
and
hold
your
arms
in
this
and
when
he
strikes
at
you
move
them
as
i
now
show
you
and
he
hurt
you
now
do
be
afraid
but
go
at
him
i
confess
that
i
was
somewhat
afraid
but
i
considered
myself
in
some
degree
under
the
protection
of
the
famous
sergeant
and
clenching
my
fist
i
went
at
my
foe
using
the
guard
which
my
ally
recommended
the
result
corresponded
to
a
certain
degree
with
the
predictions
of
the
sergeant
i
gave
my
foe
a
bloody
nose
and
a
black
eye
though
notwithstanding
my
recent
lesson
in
the
art
of
he
contrived
to
give
me
two
or
three
clumsy
blows
from
that
moment
i
was
the
especial
favourite
of
the
sergeant
who
gave
me
further
lessons
so
that
in
a
little
time
i
became
a
very
fair
boxer
beating
everybody
of
my
own
size
who
attacked
me
the
old
gentleman
however
made
me
promise
never
to
be
quarrelsome
nor
to
turn
his
instructions
to
account
except
in
i
have
always
borne
in
mind
my
promise
and
have
made
it
a
point
of
conscience
never
to
fight
unless
absolutely
compelled
folks
may
rail
against
boxing
if
they
please
but
being
able
to
box
may
sometimes
stand
a
quiet
man
in
good
stead
how
should
i
have
fared
but
for
the
instructions
of
sergeant
broughton
but
for
them
the
brutal
ruffian
who
insulted
me
must
have
passed
unpunished
he
will
not
soon
forget
the
lesson
which
i
have
just
given
him
the
only
lesson
he
could
understand
what
would
have
been
the
use
of
reasoning
with
a
fellow
of
that
description
brave
old
broughton
i
owe
him
much
and
your
manner
of
fighting
said
i
was
the
manner
employed
by
sergeant
broughton
yes
said
my
new
acquaintance
it
was
the
manner
in
which
he
beat
every
one
who
attempted
to
contend
with
him
till
in
an
evil
hour
he
entered
the
ring
with
slack
without
any
training
or
preparation
and
by
a
chance
blow
lost
the
battle
to
a
man
who
had
been
beaten
with
ease
by
those
who
in
the
hands
of
broughton
appeared
like
so
many
children
it
was
the
way
of
fighting
of
him
who
first
taught
englishmen
to
box
scientifically
who
was
the
head
and
father
of
the
fighters
of
what
is
now
called
the
old
school
the
last
of
which
were
johnson
and
big
ben
a
wonderful
man
that
big
ben
said
i
he
was
so
said
the
elderly
individual
but
had
it
not
been
for
broughton
i
question
whether
ben
would
have
ever
been
the
fighter
he
was
oh
there
was
no
one
like
old
broughton
but
for
him
i
should
at
the
present
moment
be
sneaking
along
the
road
pursued
by
the
hissings
and
hootings
of
the
dirty
flatterers
of
that
blackguard
coachman
what
did
you
mean
said
i
by
those
words
of
yours
that
the
coachmen
would
speedily
disappear
from
the
roads
i
meant
said
he
that
a
new
method
of
travelling
is
about
to
be
established
which
will
supersede
the
old
i
am
a
poor
engraver
as
my
father
was
before
me
but
engraving
is
an
intellectual
trade
and
by
following
it
i
have
been
brought
in
contact
with
some
of
the
cleverest
men
in
england
it
has
even
made
me
acquainted
with
the
projector
of
the
scheme
which
he
has
told
me
many
of
the
wisest
heads
of
england
have
been
dreaming
of
during
a
period
of
six
hundred
years
and
which
it
seems
was
alluded
to
by
a
certain
brazen
head
in
the
of
friar
bacon
who
is
generally
supposed
to
have
been
a
wizard
but
in
reality
was
a
great
philosopher
young
man
in
less
than
twenty
years
by
which
time
i
shall
be
dead
and
gone
england
will
be
surrounded
with
roads
of
metal
on
which
armies
may
travel
with
mighty
velocity
and
of
which
the
walls
of
brass
and
iron
by
which
the
friar
proposed
to
defend
his
native
land
are
the
types
he
then
shaking
me
by
the
hand
proceeded
on
his
way
whilst
i
returned
to
the
inn
chapter

and

fight
great
men
of
the
world
a
few
days
after
the
circumstance
which
i
have
last
commemorated
it
chanced
that
as
i
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
inn
one
of
the
numerous
which
were
in
the
habit
of
stopping
there
drove
up
and
several
passengers
got
down
i
had
assisted
a
woman
with
a
couple
of
children
to
dismount
and
had
just
delivered
to
her
a
which
appeared
to
be
her
only
property
which
she
had
begged
me
to
fetch
down
from
the
roof
when
i
felt
a
hand
laid
upon
my
shoulder
and
heard
a
voice
exclaim
is
it
possible
old
fellow
that
i
find
you
in
this
place
i
turned
round
and
wrapped
in
a
large
blue
cloak
i
beheld
my
good
friend
francis
ardry
i
shook
him
most
warmly
by
the
hand
and
said
if
you
are
surprised
to
see
me
i
am
no
less
so
to
see
you
where
are
you
bound
to
i
am
bound
for
at
any
rate
i
am
booked
for
that
said
my
friend
in
reply
i
am
sorry
for
it
said
i
for
in
that
case
we
shall
have
to
part
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
coach
by
which
you
came
stopping
no
longer
and
whither
are
you
bound
demanded
my
friend
i
am
stopping
at
present
in
this
house
quite
undetermined
as
to
what
to
do
then
come
along
with
me
said
francis
ardry
that
i
can
scarcely
do
said
i
i
have
a
horse
in
the
stall
which
i
can
not
afford
to
ruin
by
racing
to
l
by
the
side
of
your
coach
my
friend
mused
for
a
moment
i
have
no
particular
business
at
l
said
he
i
was
merely
going
thither
to
pass
a
day
or
two
till
an
affair
in
which
i
am
deeply
interested
at
c
shall
come
off
i
think
i
shall
stay
with
you
for
hours
at
least
i
have
been
rather
melancholy
of
late
and
can
not
afford
to
part
with
a
friend
like
you
at
the
present
moment
it
is
an
unexpected
piece
of
good
fortune
to
have
met
you
and
i
have
not
been
very
fortunate
of
late
he
added
sighing
well
said
i
i
am
glad
to
see
you
once
more
whether
fortunate
or
not
where
is
your
baggage
yon
trunk
is
mine
said
francis
pointing
to
a
trunk
of
black
russian
leather
upon
the
coach
we
will
soon
have
it
down
said
i
and
at
a
word
which
i
gave
to
one
of
the
of
the
inn
the
trunk
was
taken
from
the
top
of
the
coach
now
said
i
to
francis
ardry
follow
me
i
am
a
person
of
some
authority
in
this
house
thereupon
i
led
francis
ardry
into
the
house
and
a
word
which
i
said
to
a
waiter
forthwith
installed
francis
ardry
in
a
comfortable
private
and
his
trunk
in
the
very
best
of
our
extensive
establishment
it
was
now
about
one
francis
ardry
ordered
dinner
for
two
to
be
ready
at
four
and
a
pint
of
sherry
to
be
brought
forthwith
which
i
requested
my
friend
the
waiter
might
be
the
very
best
and
which
in
effect
turned
out
as
i
requested
we
sat
down
and
when
we
had
drunk
to
each
other
health
frank
requested
me
to
make
known
to
him
how
i
had
contrived
to
free
myself
from
my
embarrassments
in
london
what
i
had
been
about
since
i
quitted
that
city
and
the
present
posture
of
my
affairs
i
related
to
francis
ardry
how
i
had
composed
the
life
of
joseph
sell
and
how
the
sale
of
it
to
the
bookseller
had
enabled
me
to
quit
london
with
money
in
my
pocket
which
had
supported
me
during
a
long
course
of
ramble
in
the
country
into
the
particulars
of
which
i
however
did
not
enter
with
any
considerable
degree
of
fulness
i
summed
up
my
account
by
saying
that
i
was
at
present
a
kind
of
overlooker
in
the
stables
of
the
inn
had
still
some
pounds
in
my
purse
and
moreover
a
capital
horse
in
the
stall
no
very
agreeable
posture
of
affairs
said
francis
ardry
looking
rather
seriously
at
me
i
make
no
complaints
said
i
my
prospects
are
not
very
bright
it
is
true
but
sometimes
i
have
visions
both
waking
and
sleeping
which
though
always
strange
are
invariably
agreeable
last
night
in
my
chamber
near
the
hayloft
i
dreamt
that
i
had
passed
over
an
almost
interminable
wilderness
an
enormous
wall
rose
before
me
the
wall
methought
was
the
great
wall
of
china
strange
figures
appeared
to
be
beckoning
to
me
from
the
top
of
the
wall
such
visions
are
not
exactly
to
be
sneered
at
not
that
such
phantasmagoria
said
i
raising
my
voice
are
to
be
compared
for
a
moment
with
such
desirable
things
as
fashion
fine
clothes
cheques
from
uncles
parliamentary
interest
the
love
of
splendid
females
ah
woman
love
said
i
and
sighed
what
the
matter
with
the
fellow
said
francis
ardry
there
is
nothing
like
it
said
i
like
what
love
divine
love
said
i
confound
love
said
francis
ardry
i
hate
the
very
name
i
have
made
myself
a
pretty
fool
by
it
but
trust
me
for
ever
being
at
such
folly
again
in
an
evil
hour
i
abandoned
my
former
pursuits
and
amusements
for
it
in
one
morning
spent
at
joey
there
was
more
real
pleasure
than
in
surely
said
i
you
are
not
hankering
after
again
a
sport
which
none
but
the
gross
and
unrefined
care
anything
for
no
one
thoughts
should
be
occupied
by
something
higher
and
more
rational
than
and
what
better
than
love
divine
love
oh
nothing
like
it
pray
do
talk
nonsense
said
francis
ardry
nonsense
said
i
why
i
was
repeating
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
what
i
heard
you
say
on
a
former
occasion
if
ever
i
talked
such
stuff
said
francis
ardry
i
was
a
fool
and
indeed
i
can
not
deny
that
i
have
been
one
no
there
no
denying
that
i
have
been
a
fool
what
do
you
think
that
false
annette
has
cruelly
abandoned
me
well
said
i
perhaps
you
have
yourself
to
thank
for
her
having
done
so
did
you
never
treat
her
with
coldness
and
repay
her
marks
of
affectionate
interest
with
strange
fits
of
eccentric
humour
lord
how
little
you
know
of
women
said
francis
ardry
had
i
done
as
you
suppose
i
should
probably
have
possessed
her
at
the
present
moment
i
treated
her
in
a
manner
diametrically
opposite
to
that
i
loaded
her
with
presents
was
always
most
assiduous
to
her
always
at
her
feet
as
i
may
say
yet
she
nevertheless
abandoned
me
and
for
whom
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
say
for
a
fiddler
i
took
a
glass
of
wine
francis
ardry
followed
my
example
and
then
proceeded
to
detail
to
me
the
treatment
which
he
had
experienced
from
annette
and
from
what
he
said
it
appeared
that
her
conduct
to
him
had
been
in
the
highest
degree
reprehensible
notwithstanding
he
had
indulged
her
in
everything
she
was
never
civil
to
him
but
loaded
him
continually
with
taunts
and
insults
and
had
finally
on
his
being
unable
to
supply
her
with
a
sum
of
money
which
she
had
demanded
decamped
from
the
lodgings
which
he
had
taken
for
her
carrying
with
her
all
the
presents
which
at
various
times
he
had
bestowed
upon
her
and
had
put
herself
under
the
protection
of
a
gentleman
who
played
the
bassoon
at
the
italian
opera
at
which
place
it
appeared
that
her
sister
had
lately
been
engaged
as
a
danseuse
my
friend
informed
me
that
at
first
he
had
experienced
great
agony
at
the
ingratitude
of
annette
but
at
last
had
made
up
his
mind
to
forget
her
and
in
order
more
effectually
to
do
so
had
left
london
with
the
intention
of
witnessing
a
fight
which
was
shortly
coming
off
at
a
town
in
these
parts
between
some
dogs
and
a
lion
which
combat
he
informed
me
had
for
some
time
past
been
looked
forward
to
with
intense
eagerness
by
the
gentlemen
of
the
sporting
world
i
commended
him
for
his
resolution
at
the
same
time
advising
him
not
to
give
up
his
mind
entirely
to
as
he
had
formerly
done
but
when
the
present
combat
should
be
over
to
return
to
his
rhetorical
studies
and
above
all
to
marry
some
rich
and
handsome
lady
on
the
first
opportunity
as
with
his
person
and
expectations
he
had
only
to
sue
for
the
hand
of
the
daughter
of
a
marquis
to
be
successful
telling
him
with
a
sigh
that
all
women
were
not
annettes
and
that
upon
the
whole
there
was
nothing
like
them
to
which
advice
he
answered
that
he
intended
to
return
to
rhetoric
as
soon
as
the
lion
fight
should
be
over
but
that
he
never
intended
to
marry
having
had
enough
of
women
adding
that
he
was
glad
he
had
no
sister
as
with
the
feelings
which
he
entertained
with
respect
to
her
sex
he
should
be
unable
to
treat
her
with
common
affection
and
concluded
by
repeating
a
proverb
which
he
had
learnt
from
an
arab
whom
he
had
met
at
venice
to
the
effect
that
one
who
has
been
stung
by
a
snake
shivers
at
the
sight
of
a
sting
after
a
little
more
conversation
we
strolled
to
the
stable
where
my
horse
was
standing
my
friend
who
was
a
connoisseur
in
horseflesh
surveyed
the
animal
with
attention
and
after
inquiring
where
and
how
i
had
obtained
him
asked
what
i
intended
to
do
with
him
on
my
telling
him
that
i
was
undetermined
and
that
i
was
afraid
the
horse
was
likely
to
prove
a
burden
to
me
he
said
it
is
a
noble
animal
and
if
you
mind
what
you
are
about
you
may
make
a
small
fortune
by
him
i
do
not
want
such
an
animal
myself
nor
do
i
know
any
one
who
does
but
a
great
fair
will
be
held
shortly
at
a
place
where
it
is
true
i
have
never
been
but
of
which
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
from
my
acquaintances
where
it
is
said
a
horse
is
always
sure
to
fetch
its
value
that
place
is
horncastle
in
lincolnshire
you
should
take
him
thither
francis
ardry
and
myself
dined
together
and
after
dinner
partook
of
a
bottle
of
the
best
port
which
the
inn
afforded
after
a
few
glasses
we
had
a
great
deal
of
conversation
i
again
brought
the
subject
of
marriage
and
love
divine
love
upon
the
carpet
but
francis
almost
immediately
begged
me
to
drop
it
and
on
my
having
the
delicacy
to
comply
he
reverted
to
on
which
he
talked
well
and
learnedly
amongst
other
things
he
said
it
was
a
princely
sport
of
great
antiquity
and
quoted
from
quintus
curtius
to
prove
that
the
princes
of
india
must
have
been
of
the
fancy
they
having
according
to
that
author
treated
alexander
to
a
fight
between
certain
dogs
and
a
lion
becoming
notwithstanding
my
friend
eloquence
and
learning
somewhat
tired
of
the
subject
i
began
to
talk
about
alexander
francis
ardry
said
he
was
one
of
the
two
great
men
whom
the
world
has
produced
the
other
being
napoleon
i
replied
that
i
believed
tamerlane
was
a
greater
man
than
either
but
francis
ardry
knew
nothing
of
tamerlane
save
what
he
had
gathered
from
the
play
of
timour
the
tartar
no
said
he
alexander
and
napoleon
are
the
great
men
of
the
world
their
names
are
known
everywhere
alexander
has
been
dead
upwards
of
two
thousand
years
but
the
very
english
bumpkins
sometimes
christen
their
boys
by
the
name
of
alexander
can
there
be
a
greater
evidence
of
his
greatness
as
for
napoleon
there
are
some
parts
of
india
in
which
his
bust
is
worshipped
wishing
to
make
up
a
triumvirate
i
mentioned
the
name
of
wellington
to
which
francis
ardry
merely
said
bah
and
resumed
the
subject
of
fighting
francis
ardry
remained
at
the
inn
during
that
day
and
the
next
and
then
departed
to
the
dog
and
lion
fight
i
never
saw
him
afterwards
and
merely
heard
of
him
once
after
a
lapse
of
some
years
and
what
i
then
heard
was
not
exactly
what
i
could
have
wished
to
hear
he
did
not
make
much
of
the
advantages
which
he
possessed
a
pity
for
how
great
were
those
advantages
person
intellect
eloquence
connection
riches
yet
with
all
these
advantages
one
thing
highly
needful
seems
to
have
been
wanting
in
francis
a
desire
a
craving
to
perform
something
great
and
good
oh
what
a
vast
deal
may
be
done
with
intellect
courage
riches
accompanied
by
the
desire
of
doing
something
great
and
good
why
a
person
may
carry
the
blessings
of
civilization
and
religion
to
barbarous
yet
at
the
same
time
beautiful
and
romantic
lands
and
what
a
triumph
there
is
for
him
who
does
so
what
a
crown
of
glory
of
far
greater
value
than
those
surrounding
the
brows
of
your
mere
conquerors
yet
who
has
done
so
in
these
times
not
many
not
three
not
two
something
seems
to
have
been
always
wanting
there
is
however
one
instance
in
which
the
various
requisites
have
been
united
and
the
crown
the
most
desirable
in
the
world
at
least
which
i
consider
to
be
the
most
desirable
achieved
and
only
one
that

platitude
and
the
man
in
black
the
postillion
adventures
the
lone
house
a
goodly
assemblage
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
i
was
destined
to
see
at
this
inn
more
acquaintances
than
one
on
the
day
of
francis
ardry
departure
shortly
after
he
had
taken
leave
of
me
as
i
was
standing
in
the
at
a
kind
of
or
desk
fastened
to
the
wall
with
a
book
before
me
in
which
i
was
making
out
an
account
of
the
corn
and
hay
lately
received
and
distributed
my
friend
the
postillion
came
running
in
out
of
breath
here
they
both
are
he
gasped
out
pray
do
come
and
look
at
them
whom
do
you
mean
said
i
why
that
jack
priest
and
that
idiotic
parson
platitude
they
have
just
been
set
down
by
one
of
the
coaches
and
want
a
postchaise
to
go
across
the
country
in
and
what
do
you
think
i
am
to
have
the
driving
of
them
i
have
no
time
to
lose
for
i
must
get
myself
ready
so
do
come
and
look
at
them
i
hastened
into
the
yard
of
the
inn
two
or
three
of
the
helpers
of
our
establishment
were
employed
in
drawing
forward
a
postchaise
out
of
the
which
occupied
one
side
of
the
yard
and
which
was
spacious
enough
to
contain
nearly
twenty
of
these
vehicles
though
it
was
never
full
several
of
them
being
always
out
upon
the
roads
as
the
demand
upon
us
for
postchaises
across
the
country
was
very
great
there
they
are
said
the
postillion
softly
nodding
towards
two
individuals
in
one
of
whom
i
recognized
the
man
in
black
and
in
the
other
platitude
there
they
are
have
a
good
look
at
them
while
i
go
and
get
ready
the
man
in
black
and
platitude
were
walking
up
and
down
the
yard
platitude
was
doing
his
best
to
make
himself
appear
ridiculous
talking
very
loudly
in
exceedingly
bad
italian
evidently
for
the
purpose
of
attracting
the
notice
of
the
bystanders
in
which
he
succeeded
all
the
and
about
the
yard
attracted
by
his
vociferation
grinning
at
his
ridiculous
figure
as
he
limped
up
and
down
the
man
in
black
said
little
or
nothing
but
from
the
glances
which
he
cast
sideways
appeared
to
be
thoroughly
ashamed
of
his
companion
the
worthy
couple
presently
arrived
close
to
where
i
was
standing
and
the
man
in
black
who
was
nearest
to
me
perceiving
me
stood
still
as
if
hesitating
but
recovering
himself
in
a
moment
he
moved
on
without
taking
any
farther
notice
platitude
exclaimed
as
they
passed
in
broken
lingo
i
hope
we
shall
find
the
holy
doctors
all
assembled
and
as
they
returned
i
make
no
doubt
that
they
will
all
be
rejoiced
to
see
me
not
wishing
to
be
standing
an
idle
gazer
i
went
to
the
chaise
and
assisted
in
attaching
the
horses
which
had
now
been
brought
out
to
the
pole
the
postillion
presently
arrived
and
finding
all
ready
took
the
reins
and
mounted
the
box
whilst
i
very
politely
opened
the
door
for
the
two
travellers
platitude
got
in
first
and
without
taking
any
notice
of
me
seated
himself
on
the
farther
side
in
got
the
man
in
black
and
seated
himself
nearest
to
me
all
is
right
said
i
as
i
shut
the
door
whereupon
the
postillion
cracked
his
whip
and
the
chaise
drove
out
of
the
yard
just
as
i
shut
the
door
however
and
just
as
platitude
had
recommenced
talking
in
jergo
at
the
top
of
his
voice
the
man
in
black
turned
his
face
partly
towards
me
and
gave
me
a
wink
with
his
left
eye
i
did
not
see
my
friend
the
postillion
till
the
next
morning
when
he
gave
me
an
account
of
the
adventures
he
had
met
with
on
his
expedition
it
appeared
that
he
had
driven
the
man
in
black
and
the
reverend
platitude
across
the
country
by
roads
and
lanes
which
he
had
some
difficulty
in
threading
at
length
when
he
had
reached
a
part
of
the
country
where
he
had
never
been
before
the
man
in
black
pointed
out
to
him
a
house
near
the
corner
of
a
wood
to
which
he
informed
him
they
were
bound
the
postillion
said
it
was
a
house
with
a
wall
round
it
and
upon
the
whole
bore
something
of
the
look
of
a
madhouse
there
was
already
a
postchaise
at
the
gate
from
which
three
individuals
had
alighted
one
of
them
the
postillion
said
was
a
scoundrel
with
a
regular
expression
in
his
countenance
he
was
dressed
very
much
like
the
man
in
black
and
the
postillion
said
that
he
could
almost
have
taken
his
bible
oath
that
they
were
both
of
the
same
profession
the
other
two
he
said
were
parsons
he
could
swear
that
though
he
had
never
seen
them
before
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
them
church
of
england
parsons
the
postillion
swore
they
were
with
their
black
coats
white
cravats
and
airs
in
which
clumsiness
and
conceit
were
most
funnily
blended
church
of
england
parsons
of
the
platitude
description
who
had
been
in
italy
and
seen
the
pope
and
kissed
his
toe
and
picked
up
a
little
broken
italian
and
come
home
greater
fools
than
they
went
forth
it
appeared
that
they
were
all
acquaintances
of
platitude
for
when
the
postillion
had
alighted
and
let
platitude
and
his
companion
out
of
the
chaise
platitude
shook
the
whole
three
by
the
hand
conversed
with
his
two
brothers
in
a
little
broken
jergo
and
addressed
the
looking
individual
by
the
title
of
reverend
doctor
in
the
midst
of
these
greetings
however
the
postillion
said
the
man
in
black
came
up
to
him
and
proceeded
to
settle
with
him
for
the
chaise
he
had
shaken
hands
with
nobody
and
had
merely
nodded
to
the
others
and
now
said
the
postillion
he
evidently
wished
to
get
rid
of
me
fearing
probably
that
i
should
see
too
much
of
the
nonsense
that
was
going
on
it
was
whilst
settling
with
me
that
he
seemed
to
recognize
me
for
the
first
time
for
he
stared
hard
at
me
and
at
last
asked
whether
i
had
not
been
in
italy
to
which
question
with
a
nod
and
a
laugh
i
replied
that
i
had
i
was
then
going
to
ask
him
about
the
health
of
the
image
of
holy
mary
and
to
say
that
i
hoped
it
had
recovered
from
its
horsewhipping
but
he
interrupted
me
paid
me
the
money
for
the
fare
and
gave
me
a
crown
for
myself
saying
he
would
not
detain
me
any
longer
i
say
partner
i
am
a
poor
postillion
but
when
he
gave
me
the
crown
i
had
a
good
mind
to
fling
it
in
his
face
i
reflected
however
that
it
was
not
mere
but
coin
which
i
had
earned
and
hardly
too
so
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
i
bethought
me
moreover
that
knave
as
i
knew
him
to
be
he
had
always
treated
me
with
civility
so
i
nodded
to
him
and
he
said
something
which
perhaps
he
meant
for
latin
but
which
sounded
very
much
like
and
by
which
he
doubtless
alluded
to
the
money
which
he
had
given
me
he
then
went
into
the
house
with
the
rest
the
coach
drove
away
which
had
brought
the
others
and
i
was
about
to
get
on
the
box
and
follow
observing
however
two
more
chaises
driving
up
i
thought
i
would
be
in
no
hurry
so
i
just
led
my
horses
and
chaise
a
little
out
of
the
way
and
pretending
to
be
occupied
about
the
harness
i
kept
a
tolerably
sharp
at
the
new
arrivals
well
partner
the
next
vehicle
that
drove
up
was
a
gentleman
carriage
which
i
knew
very
well
as
well
as
those
within
it
who
were
a
father
and
son
the
father
a
good
kind
old
gentleman
and
a
justice
of
the
peace
therefore
not
very
wise
as
you
may
suppose
the
son
a
puppy
who
has
been
abroad
where
he
contrived
to
forget
his
own
language
though
only
nine
months
absent
and
now
rules
the
roast
over
his
father
and
mother
whose
only
child
he
is
and
by
whom
he
is
thought
wondrous
clever
so
this
foreigneering
chap
brings
his
poor
old
father
to
this
house
to
meet
these
platitudes
and
villains
and
perhaps
would
have
brought
his
mother
too
only
simple
thing
by
good
fortune
she
happens
to
be
laid
up
with
the
rheumatic
well
the
father
and
son
i
beg
pardon
i
mean
the
son
and
father
got
down
and
went
in
and
then
after
their
carriage
was
gone
the
chaise
behind
drove
up
in
which
was
a
huge
fat
fellow
weighing
twenty
stone
at
least
but
with
something
of
a
foreign
look
and
with
him
who
do
you
think
why
a
rascally
unitarian
minister
that
is
a
fellow
who
had
been
such
a
minister
but
who
some
years
ago
leaving
his
own
people
who
had
bred
him
up
and
sent
him
to
their
college
at
york
went
over
to
the
high
church
and
is
now
i
suppose
going
over
to
some
other
church
for
he
was
talking
as
he
got
down
wondrous
fast
in
latin
or
what
sounded
something
like
latin
to
the
fat
fellow
who
appeared
to
take
things
wonderfully
easy
and
merely
grunted
to
the
dog
latin
which
the
scoundrel
had
learnt
at
the
expense
of
the
poor
unitarians
at
york
so
they
went
into
the
house
and
presently
arrived
another
chaise
but
ere
i
could
make
any
further
observations
the
porter
of
the
house
came
up
to
me
asking
what
i
was
stopping
there
for
bidding
me
go
away
and
not
pry
into
other
people
business
business
said
i
to
him
is
being
transacted
in
a
place
like
this
and
then
i
was
going
to
say
something
uncivil
but
he
went
to
attend
to
the
new
comers
and
i
took
myself
away
on
my
own
business
as
he
bade
me
not
however
before
observing
that
these
two
last
were
a
couple
of
blackcoats
the
postillion
then
proceeded
to
relate
how
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
a
small
about
a
mile
off
where
he
had
intended
to
bait
and
how
he
met
on
the
way
a
landau
and
pair
belonging
to
a
scotch
coxcomb
whom
he
had
known
in
london
about
whom
he
related
some
curious
particulars
and
then
continued
well
after
i
had
passed
him
and
his
i
drove
straight
to
the
where
i
baited
my
horses
and
where
i
found
some
of
the
chaises
and
drivers
who
had
driven
the
folks
to
the
mansion
and
were
now
waiting
to
take
them
up
again
whilst
my
horses
were
eating
their
bait
i
sat
me
down
as
the
weather
was
warm
at
a
table
outside
and
smoked
a
pipe
and
drank
some
ale
in
company
with
the
coachman
of
the
old
gentleman
who
had
gone
to
the
house
with
his
son
and
the
coachman
then
told
me
that
the
house
was
a
papist
house
and
that
the
present
was
a
grand
meeting
of
all
the
fools
and
rascals
in
the
country
who
came
to
bow
down
to
images
and
to
concert
schemes
pretty
schemes
no
doubt
for
overturning
the
religion
of
the
country
and
that
for
his
part
he
did
not
approve
of
being
concerned
with
such
doings
and
that
he
was
going
to
give
his
master
warning
next
day
so
as
we
were
drinking
and
discoursing
up
drove
the
chariot
of
the
scotchman
and
down
got
his
valet
and
the
driver
and
whilst
the
driver
was
seeing
after
the
horses
the
valet
came
and
sat
down
at
the
table
where
the
gentleman
coachman
and
i
were
drinking
i
knew
the
fellow
well
a
scotchman
like
his
master
and
just
of
the
same
kidney
with
white
kid
gloves
red
hair
frizzled
a
patch
of
paint
on
his
face
and
his
hands
covered
with
rings
this
very
fellow
i
must
tell
you
was
one
of
those
most
busy
in
endeavouring
to
get
me
turned
out
of
the
servants
club
in
park
lane
because
i
happened
to
serve
a
literary
man
so
he
sat
down
and
in
a
kind
of
affected
tone
cried
out
bring
me
a
glass
of
cold
negus
the
landlord
however
told
him
that
there
was
no
negus
but
that
if
he
pleased
he
could
have
a
jug
of
as
good
beer
as
any
in
the
country
the
beer
said
the
valet
you
think
that
i
am
accustomed
to
such
vulgar
beverage
however
as
he
found
there
was
nothing
better
to
be
had
he
let
the
man
bring
him
some
beer
and
when
he
had
got
it
soon
showed
that
he
could
drink
it
easily
enough
so
when
he
had
drunk
two
or
three
draughts
he
turned
his
eyes
in
a
contemptuous
manner
first
on
the
coachman
and
then
on
me
i
saw
the
scamp
recollected
me
for
after
staring
at
me
and
my
dress
for
about
half
a
minute
he
put
on
a
broad
grin
and
flinging
his
head
back
he
uttered
a
loud
laugh
well
i
did
not
like
this
as
you
may
well
believe
and
taking
the
pipe
out
of
my
mouth
i
asked
him
if
he
meant
anything
personal
to
which
he
answered
that
he
had
said
nothing
to
me
and
that
he
had
a
right
to
look
where
he
pleased
and
laugh
when
he
pleased
well
as
to
a
certain
extent
he
was
right
as
to
looking
and
laughing
and
as
i
have
occasionally
looked
at
a
fool
and
laughed
though
i
was
not
the
fool
in
this
instance
i
put
my
pipe
into
my
mouth
and
said
no
more
this
quiet
and
behaviour
of
mine
however
the
fellow
interpreted
into
fear
so
after
drinking
a
little
more
he
suddenly
started
up
and
striding
once
or
twice
before
the
table
he
asked
me
what
i
meant
by
that
impertinent
question
of
mine
saying
that
he
had
a
good
mind
to
wring
my
nose
for
my
presumption
have
said
i
getting
up
and
laying
down
my
pipe
i
now
give
you
an
opportunity
so
i
put
myself
in
an
attitude
and
went
up
to
him
saying
have
an
old
score
to
settle
with
you
you
scamp
you
wanted
to
get
me
turned
out
of
the
club
did
you
and
thereupon
remembering
that
he
had
threatened
to
wring
my
nose
i
gave
him
a
snorter
upon
his
own
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
the
fellow
when
he
felt
the
smart
so
far
from
trying
to
defend
himself
he
turned
round
and
with
his
hand
to
his
face
attempted
to
run
away
but
i
was
now
in
a
regular
passion
and
following
him
up
got
before
him
and
was
going
to
pummel
away
at
him
when
he
burst
into
tears
and
begged
me
not
to
hurt
him
saying
that
he
was
sorry
if
he
had
offended
me
and
that
if
i
pleased
he
would
go
down
on
his
knees
or
do
anything
else
i
wanted
well
when
i
heard
him
talk
in
this
manner
i
of
course
let
him
be
i
could
hardly
help
laughing
at
the
figure
he
cut
his
face
all
blubbered
with
tears
and
blood
and
paint
but
i
did
not
laugh
at
the
poor
creature
either
but
went
to
the
table
and
took
up
my
pipe
and
smoked
and
drank
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
the
fellow
after
having
been
to
the
pump
came
and
sat
down
crying
and
trying
to
curry
favour
with
me
and
the
coachman
presently
however
putting
on
a
confidential
look
he
began
to
talk
of
the
popish
house
and
of
the
doings
there
and
said
he
supposed
as
how
we
were
of
the
party
and
that
it
was
all
right
and
then
he
began
to
talk
of
the
pope
of
rome
and
what
a
nice
man
he
was
and
what
a
fine
thing
it
was
to
be
of
his
religion
especially
if
folks
went
over
to
him
and
how
it
advanced
them
in
the
world
and
gave
them
consideration
and
how
his
master
who
had
been
abroad
and
seen
the
pope
and
kissed
his
toe
was
going
over
to
the
popish
religion
and
had
persuaded
him
to
consent
to
do
so
and
to
forsake
his
own
which
i
think
the
scoundrel
called
the
church
of
scotland
and
how
many
others
of
that
church
were
going
over
thinking
to
better
their
condition
in
life
by
so
doing
and
to
be
more
thought
on
and
how
many
of
the
english
church
were
thinking
of
going
over
too
and
that
he
had
no
doubt
that
it
would
all
end
right
and
comfortably
well
as
he
was
going
on
in
this
way
the
old
coachman
began
to
spit
and
getting
up
flung
all
the
beer
that
was
in
his
jug
upon
the
ground
and
going
away
ordered
another
jug
of
beer
and
sat
down
at
another
table
saying
that
he
would
not
drink
in
such
company
and
i
too
got
up
and
flung
what
beer
remained
in
my
jug
there
was
more
than
a
drop
in
the
fellow
face
saying
i
would
scorn
to
drink
any
more
in
such
company
and
then
i
went
to
my
horses
put
them
to
paid
my
reckoning
and
drove
home
the
postillion
having
related
his
story
to
which
i
listened
with
all
due
attention
mused
for
a
moment
and
then
said
i
dare
say
you
remember
how
some
time
since
when
old
bill
had
been
telling
us
how
the
government
a
long
time
ago
had
done
away
with
robbing
on
the
highway
by
putting
down
the
and
places
which
the
highwaymen
frequented
and
by
sending
a
good
mounted
police
to
hunt
them
down
i
said
that
it
was
a
shame
that
the
present
government
did
not
employ
somewhat
the
same
means
in
order
to
stop
the
proceedings
of
mumbo
jumbo
and
his
gang
in
england
howsomever
since
i
have
driven
a
fare
to
a
popish
rendezvous
and
seen
something
of
what
is
going
on
there
i
should
conceive
that
the
government
are
justified
in
allowing
the
gang
the
free
exercise
of
their
calling
anybody
is
welcome
to
stoop
and
pick
up
nothing
or
worse
than
nothing
and
if
mumbo
jumbo
people
after
their
expeditions
return
to
their
haunts
with
no
better
plunder
in
the
shape
of
converts
than
what
i
saw
going
into
yonder
place
of
call
i
should
say
they
are
welcome
to
what
they
get
for
if
that
the
kind
of
rubbish
they
steal
out
of
the
church
of
england
or
any
other
church
who
in
his
senses
but
would
say
a
good
riddance
and
many
thanks
for
your
trouble
at
any
rate
that
is
my
opinion
of
the
matter
chapter
xxix
deliberations
with
invitation
to
dinner
the
commercial
traveller
the
landlord
offer
the
comet
wine
it
was
now
that
i
had
frequent
deliberations
with
myself
should
i
continue
at
the
inn
in
my
present
position
i
was
not
very
much
captivated
with
it
there
was
little
poetry
in
keeping
an
account
of
the
corn
hay
and
straw
which
came
in
and
was
given
out
and
i
was
fond
of
poetry
moreover
there
was
no
glory
at
all
to
be
expected
in
doing
so
and
i
was
fond
of
glory
should
i
give
up
that
situation
and
remaining
at
the
inn
become
ostler
under
old
bill
there
was
more
poetry
in
rubbing
down
horses
than
in
keeping
an
account
of
straw
hay
and
corn
there
was
also
some
prospect
of
glory
attached
to
the
situation
of
ostler
for
the
grooms
and
occasionally
talked
of
an
ostler
a
great
way
down
the
road
who
had
been
presented
by
some
sporting
people
not
with
a
silver
vase
as
our
governor
had
been
but
with
a
silver
currycomb
in
testimony
of
their
admiration
for
his
skill
but
i
confess
that
the
poetry
of
rubbing
down
had
become
as
all
other
poetry
becomes
rather
prosy
by
frequent
repetition
and
with
respect
to
the
chance
of
deriving
glory
from
the
employment
i
entertained
in
the
event
of
my
determining
to
stay
very
slight
hope
of
ever
attaining
skill
in
the
ostler
art
sufficient
to
induce
sporting
people
to
bestow
upon
me
a
silver
currycomb
i
was
not
half
so
good
an
ostler
as
old
bill
who
had
never
been
presented
with
a
silver
currycomb
and
i
never
expected
to
become
so
therefore
what
chance
had
i
it
was
true
there
was
a
prospect
of
some
pecuniary
emolument
to
be
derived
by
remaining
in
either
situation
it
was
very
probable
that
provided
i
continued
to
keep
an
account
of
the
hay
and
corn
coming
in
and
expended
the
landlord
would
consent
to
allow
me
a
pound
a
week
which
at
the
end
of
a
dozen
years
provided
i
kept
myself
sober
would
amount
to
a
considerable
sum
i
might
on
the
retirement
of
old
bill
by
taking
his
place
save
up
a
decent
sum
of
money
provided
unlike
him
i
kept
myself
sober
and
laid
by
all
the
shillings
and
sixpences
i
got
but
the
prospect
of
laying
up
a
decent
sum
of
money
was
not
of
sufficient
importance
to
induce
me
to
continue
either
at
my
wooden
desk
or
in
the
the
reader
will
remember
what
difficulty
i
had
to
make
up
my
mind
to
become
a
merchant
under
the
armenian
auspices
even
with
the
prospect
of
making
two
or
three
hundred
thousand
pounds
by
following
the
armenian
way
of
doing
business
so
it
was
not
probable
that
i
should
feel
disposed
to
be
a
keeper
or
ostler
all
my
life
with
no
other
prospect
than
being
able
to
make
a
tidy
sum
of
money
if
indeed
besides
the
prospect
of
making
a
tidy
sum
at
the
end
of
perhaps
forty
years
ostlering
i
had
been
certain
of
being
presented
with
a
silver
currycomb
with
my
name
engraved
upon
it
which
i
might
have
left
to
my
descendants
or
in
default
thereof
to
the
parish
church
destined
to
contain
my
bones
with
directions
that
it
might
be
soldered
into
the
wall
above
the
arch
leading
from
the
body
of
the
church
into
the
chancel
i
will
not
say
with
such
a
certainty
of
immortality
combined
with
such
a
prospect
of
moderate
pecuniary
advantage
i
might
not
have
thought
it
worth
my
while
to
stay
but
i
entertained
no
such
certainty
and
taking
everything
into
consideration
i
determined
to
mount
my
horse
and
leave
the
inn
this
horse
had
caused
me
for
some
time
past
no
little
perplexity
i
had
frequently
repented
of
having
purchased
him
more
especially
as
the
purchase
had
been
made
with
another
person
money
and
had
more
than
once
shown
him
to
people
who
i
imagined
were
likely
to
purchase
him
but
though
they
were
profuse
in
his
praise
as
people
generally
are
in
the
praise
of
what
they
do
intend
to
purchase
they
never
made
me
an
offer
and
now
that
i
had
determined
to
mount
on
his
back
and
ride
away
what
was
i
to
do
with
him
in
the
sequel
i
could
not
maintain
him
long
suddenly
i
bethought
me
of
horncastle
which
francis
ardry
had
mentioned
as
a
place
where
the
horse
was
likely
to
find
a
purchaser
and
not
having
determined
upon
any
particular
place
to
which
to
repair
i
thought
that
i
could
do
no
better
than
betake
myself
to
horncastle
in
the
first
instance
and
there
endeavour
to
dispose
of
my
horse
on
making
inquiries
with
respect
to
the
situation
of
horncastle
and
the
time
when
the
fair
would
be
held
i
learned
that
the
town
was
situated
in
lincolnshire
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
the
inn
at
which
i
was
at
present
sojourning
and
that
the
fair
would
be
held
nominally
within
about
a
month
but
that
it
was
always
requisite
to
be
on
the
spot
some
days
before
the
nominal
day
of
the
fair
as
all
the
best
horses
were
generally
sold
before
that
time
and
the
people
who
came
to
purchase
gone
away
with
what
they
had
bought
the
people
of
the
inn
were
very
sorry
on
being
informed
of
my
determination
to
depart
old
bill
told
me
that
he
had
hoped
as
how
i
had
intended
to
settle
down
there
and
to
take
his
place
as
ostler
when
he
was
fit
for
no
more
work
adding
that
though
i
did
not
know
much
of
the
business
yet
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
i
might
improve
my
friend
the
postillion
was
particularly
sorry
and
taking
me
with
him
to
the
called
for
two
pints
of
beer
to
one
of
which
he
treated
me
and
whilst
we
were
drinking
told
me
how
particularly
sorry
he
was
at
the
thought
of
my
going
but
that
he
hoped
i
should
think
better
of
the
matter
on
my
telling
him
that
i
must
go
he
said
that
he
trusted
i
should
put
off
my
departure
for
three
weeks
in
order
that
i
might
be
present
at
his
marriage
the
banns
of
which
were
just
about
to
be
published
he
said
that
nothing
would
give
him
greater
pleasure
than
to
see
me
dance
a
minuet
with
his
wife
after
the
marriage
dinner
but
i
told
him
it
was
impossible
that
i
should
stay
my
affairs
imperatively
calling
me
elsewhere
and
that
with
respect
to
my
dancing
a
minuet
such
a
thing
was
out
of
the
question
as
i
had
never
learned
to
dance
at
which
he
said
that
he
was
exceedingly
sorry
and
finding
me
determined
to
go
wished
me
success
in
all
my
undertakings
the
master
of
the
house
to
whom
as
in
duty
bound
i
communicated
my
intention
before
i
spoke
of
it
to
the
servants
was
i
make
no
doubt
very
sorry
though
he
did
not
exactly
tell
me
so
what
he
said
was
that
he
had
never
expected
that
i
should
remain
long
there
as
such
a
situation
never
appeared
to
him
quite
suitable
to
me
though
i
had
been
very
diligent
and
had
given
him
perfect
satisfaction
on
his
inquiring
when
i
intended
to
depart
i
informed
him
next
day
whereupon
he
begged
that
i
would
defer
my
departure
till
the
next
day
but
one
and
do
him
the
favour
of
dining
with
him
on
the
morrow
i
informed
him
that
i
should
be
only
too
happy
on
the
following
day
at
four
i
dined
with
the
landlord
in
company
with
a
commercial
traveller
the
dinner
was
good
though
plain
consisting
of
boiled
mackerel
rather
a
rarity
in
those
parts
at
that
time
with
fennel
sauce
a
prime
baron
of
roast
beef
after
the
mackerel
then
a
tart
and
noble
cheshire
cheese
we
had
prime
sherry
at
dinner
and
whilst
eating
the
cheese
prime
porter
that
of
barclay
the
only
good
porter
in
the
world
after
the
cloth
was
removed
we
had
a
bottle
of
very
good
port
and
whilst
partaking
of
the
port
i
had
an
argument
with
the
commercial
traveller
on
the
subject
of
the
the
commercial
traveller
having
worsted
me
in
the
argument
on
the
subject
of
the
got
up
in
great
glee
saying
that
he
must
order
his
gig
as
business
must
be
attended
to
before
leaving
the
room
however
he
shook
me
patronizingly
by
the
hand
and
said
something
to
the
master
of
the
house
but
in
so
low
a
tone
that
it
escaped
my
ear
no
sooner
had
he
departed
than
the
master
of
the
house
told
me
that
his
friend
the
traveller
had
just
said
that
i
was
a
confounded
sensible
young
fellow
and
not
at
all
opinionated
a
sentiment
in
which
he
himself
perfectly
agreed
then
hemming
once
or
twice
he
said
that
as
i
was
going
on
a
journey
he
hoped
i
was
tolerably
well
provided
with
money
adding
that
travelling
was
rather
expensive
especially
on
horseback
the
manner
in
which
he
supposed
as
i
had
a
horse
in
the
stable
i
intended
to
travel
i
told
him
that
though
i
was
not
particularly
well
supplied
with
money
i
had
sufficient
for
the
expenses
of
my
journey
at
the
end
of
which
i
hoped
to
procure
more
he
then
hemmed
again
and
said
that
since
i
had
been
at
the
inn
i
had
rendered
him
a
great
deal
of
service
in
more
ways
than
one
and
that
he
should
not
think
of
permitting
me
to
depart
without
making
me
some
remuneration
then
putting
his
hand
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
he
handed
me
a
cheque
for
ten
pounds
which
he
had
prepared
beforehand
the
value
of
which
he
said
i
could
receive
at
the
next
town
or
that
if
i
wished
it
any
waiter
in
the
house
would
cash
it
for
me
i
thanked
him
for
his
generosity
in
the
best
terms
i
could
select
but
handing
him
back
the
cheque
i
told
him
that
i
could
not
accept
it
saying
that
so
far
from
his
being
my
debtor
i
believed
myself
to
be
indebted
to
him
as
not
only
myself
but
my
horse
had
been
living
at
his
house
for
several
weeks
he
replied
that
as
for
my
board
at
a
house
like
his
it
amounted
to
nothing
and
as
for
the
little
corn
and
hay
which
the
horse
had
consumed
it
was
of
no
consequence
and
that
he
must
insist
upon
my
taking
the
cheque
but
i
again
declined
telling
him
that
doing
so
would
be
a
violation
of
a
rule
which
i
had
determined
to
follow
and
which
nothing
but
the
greatest
necessity
would
ever
compel
me
to
break
through
never
to
incur
obligations
but
said
he
receiving
this
money
will
not
be
incurring
an
obligation
it
is
your
due
i
do
not
think
so
said
i
i
did
not
engage
to
serve
you
for
money
nor
will
i
take
any
from
you
perhaps
you
will
take
it
as
a
loan
said
he
no
i
replied
i
never
borrow
well
said
the
landlord
smiling
you
are
different
from
all
others
that
i
am
acquainted
with
i
never
yet
knew
any
one
else
who
scrupled
to
borrow
and
receive
obligations
why
there
are
two
baronets
in
the
neighbourhood
who
have
borrowed
money
of
me
ay
and
who
have
never
repaid
what
they
borrowed
and
there
are
a
dozen
squires
who
are
under
considerable
obligations
to
me
who
i
dare
say
will
never
return
them
come
you
need
not
be
more
scrupulous
than
your
superiors
i
mean
in
station
every
vessel
must
stand
on
its
own
bottom
said
i
they
take
pleasure
in
receiving
obligations
i
take
pleasure
in
being
independent
perhaps
they
are
wise
and
i
am
a
fool
i
know
not
but
one
thing
i
am
certain
of
which
is
that
were
i
not
independent
i
should
be
very
unhappy
i
should
have
no
visions
then
have
you
any
relations
said
the
landlord
looking
at
me
compassionately
excuse
me
but
i
do
think
you
are
exactly
fit
to
take
care
of
yourself
there
you
are
mistaken
said
i
i
can
take
precious
good
care
of
myself
ay
and
can
drive
a
precious
hard
bargain
when
i
have
occasion
but
driving
bargains
is
a
widely
different
thing
from
receiving
gifts
i
am
going
to
take
my
horse
to
horncastle
and
when
there
i
shall
endeavour
to
obtain
his
full
value
ay
to
the
last
penny
horncastle
said
the
landlord
i
have
heard
of
that
place
you
be
dreaming
visions
when
you
get
there
or
they
steal
the
horse
from
under
you
well
said
he
rising
i
shall
not
press
you
further
on
the
subject
of
the
cheque
i
intend
however
to
put
you
under
an
obligation
to
me
he
then
rang
the
bell
and
having
ordered
two
fresh
glasses
to
be
brought
he
went
out
and
presently
returned
with
a
small
pint
bottle
which
he
uncorked
with
his
own
hand
then
sitting
down
he
said
the
wine
that
i
bring
here
is
port
of
eighteen
hundred
and
eleven
the
year
of
the
comet
the
best
vintage
on
record
the
wine
which
we
have
been
drinking
he
added
is
good
but
not
to
be
compared
with
this
which
i
never
sell
and
which
i
am
chary
of
when
you
have
drunk
some
of
it
i
think
you
will
own
that
i
have
conferred
an
obligation
upon
you
he
then
filled
the
glasses
the
wine
which
he
poured
out
diffusing
an
aroma
through
the
room
then
motioning
me
to
drink
he
raised
his
own
glass
to
his
lips
saying
come
friend
i
drink
to
your
success

the

a
misadventure
i
departed
from
the
inn
much
in
the
same
fashion
as
i
had
come
to
it
mounted
on
a
splendid
horse
indifferently
well
caparisoned
with
the
small
valise
attached
to
my
crupper
in
which
besides
the
few
things
i
had
brought
with
me
was
a
small
book
of
roads
with
a
map
which
had
been
presented
to
me
by
the
landlord
i
must
not
forget
to
state
that
i
did
not
ride
out
of
the
yard
but
that
my
horse
was
brought
to
me
at
the
front
door
by
old
bill
who
insisted
upon
doing
so
and
who
refused
a
piece
which
i
offered
him
and
it
will
be
as
well
to
let
the
reader
know
that
the
landlord
shook
me
by
the
hand
as
i
mounted
and
that
the
people
attached
to
the
inn
male
and
female
my
friend
the
postillion
at
the
head
assembled
before
the
house
to
see
me
off
and
gave
me
three
cheers
as
i
rode
away
perhaps
no
person
ever
departed
from
an
inn
with
more
eclat
or
better
wishes
nobody
looked
at
me
askance
except
two
who
were
loitering
about
one
of
whom
said
to
his
companion
i
say
jim
twig
his
portmanteau
a
regular
newmarket
by
it
was
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
of
a
bright
day
all
the
days
of
that
summer
were
bright
that
i
departed
i
felt
at
first
rather
melancholy
at
finding
myself
again
launched
into
the
wide
world
and
leaving
the
friends
whom
i
had
lately
made
behind
me
but
by
occasionally
trotting
the
horse
and
occasionally
singing
a
song
of
romanvile
i
had
dispelled
the
feeling
of
melancholy
by
the
time
i
had
proceeded
three
miles
down
the
main
road
it
was
at
the
end
of
these
three
miles
just
opposite
a
milestone
that
i
struck
into
a
cross
road
after
riding
about
seven
miles
threading
what
are
called
in
postillion
parlance
roads
i
reached
another
high
road
tending
to
the
east
along
which
i
proceeded
for
a
mile
or
two
when
coming
to
a
small
inn
about
nine
i
halted
and
put
up
for
the
night
early
on
the
following
morning
i
proceeded
on
my
journey
but
fearing
to
gall
the
horse
i
no
longer
rode
him
but
led
him
by
the
bridle
until
i
came
to
a
town
at
the
distance
of
about
ten
miles
from
the
place
where
i
had
passed
the
night
here
i
stayed
during
the
heat
of
the
day
more
on
the
horse
account
than
my
own
and
towards
evening
resumed
my
journey
leading
the
animal
by
the
bridle
as
before
and
in
this
manner
i
proceeded
for
several
days
travelling
on
an
average
from
twenty
to
miles
a
day
always
leading
the
animal
except
perhaps
now
and
then
of
an
evening
when
if
i
saw
a
good
piece
of
road
before
me
i
would
mount
and
put
the
horse
into
a
trot
which
the
creature
seemed
to
enjoy
as
much
as
myself
showing
his
satisfaction
by
snorting
and
neighing
whilst
i
gave
utterance
to
my
own
exhilaration
by
shouts
or
by
the
chi
she
is
kaulo
she
soves
pre
lakie
dumo
or
by
something
else
of
the
same
kind
in
romanvile
on
the
whole
i
journeyed
along
very
pleasantly
certainly
quite
as
pleasantly
as
i
do
at
present
now
that
i
am
become
a
gentleman
and
weigh
sixteen
stone
though
some
people
would
say
that
my
present
manner
of
travelling
is
much
the
most
preferable
riding
as
i
now
do
instead
of
leading
my
horse
receiving
the
homage
of
ostlers
instead
of
their
familiar
nods
sitting
down
to
dinner
in
the
parlour
of
the
best
inn
i
can
find
instead
of
passing
the
brightest
part
of
the
day
in
the
kitchen
of
a
village
alehouse
carrying
on
my
argument
after
dinner
on
the
subject
of
the
with
the
best
commercial
gentlemen
on
the
road
instead
of
being
glad
whilst
sipping
a
pint
of
beer
to
get
into
conversation
with
blind
trampers
or
maimed
abraham
sailors
regaling
themselves
on
at
the
said
village
hostelries
many
people
will
doubtless
say
that
things
have
altered
wonderfully
with
me
for
the
better
and
they
would
say
right
provided
i
possessed
now
what
i
then
carried
about
with
me
in
my
journeys
the
spirit
of
youth
youth
is
the
only
season
for
enjoyment
and
the
first
years
of
one
life
are
worth
all
the
rest
of
the
longest
life
of
man
even
though
those
be
spent
in
penury
and
contempt
and
the
rest
in
the
possession
of
wealth
honours
respectability
ay
and
many
of
them
in
strength
and
health
such
as
will
enable
one
to
ride
forty
miles
before
dinner
and
over
one
pint
of
port
for
the
best
gentleman
in
the
land
should
not
drink
a
bottle
carry
on
one
argument
with
gravity
and
decorum
with
any
commercial
gentleman
who
responsive
to
challenge
takes
the
part
of
humanity
and
common
sense
against
protection
and
the
lord
of
the
land
ah
there
is
nothing
like
youth
not
that
is
valueless
even
in
extreme
old
age
one
may
get
on
very
well
provided
we
will
but
accept
of
the
bounties
of
god
i
met
the
other
day
an
old
man
who
asked
me
to
drink
i
am
not
thirsty
said
i
and
will
not
drink
with
you
yes
you
will
said
the
old
man
for
i
am
this
day
one
hundred
years
old
and
you
will
never
again
have
an
opportunity
of
drinking
the
health
of
a
man
on
his
hundredth
birthday
so
i
broke
my
word
and
drank
yours
is
a
wonderful
age
said
i
it
is
a
long
time
to
look
back
to
the
beginning
of
it
said
the
old
man
yet
upon
the
whole
i
am
not
sorry
to
have
lived
it
all
how
have
you
passed
your
time
said
i
as
well
as
i
could
said
the
old
man
always
enjoying
a
good
thing
when
it
came
honestly
within
my
reach
not
forgetting
to
praise
god
for
putting
it
there
i
suppose
you
were
fond
of
a
glass
of
good
ale
when
you
were
young
yes
said
the
old
man
i
was
and
so
thank
god
i
am
still
and
he
drank
off
a
glass
of
ale
on
i
went
in
my
journey
traversing
england
from
west
to
east
ascending
and
descending
hills
crossing
rivers
by
bridge
and
ferry
and
passing
over
extensive
plains
what
a
beautiful
country
is
england
people
run
abroad
to
see
beautiful
countries
and
leave
their
own
behind
unknown
unnoticed
their
own
the
most
beautiful
and
then
again
what
a
country
for
adventures
especially
to
those
who
travel
on
foot
or
on
horseback
people
run
abroad
in
quest
of
adventures
and
traverse
spain
or
portugal
on
mule
or
on
horseback
whereas
there
are
ten
times
more
adventures
to
be
met
with
in
england
than
in
spain
portugal
or
stupid
germany
to
boot
witness
the
number
of
adventures
narrated
in
the
present
book
a
book
entirely
devoted
to
england
why
there
is
not
a
chapter
in
the
present
book
which
is
not
full
of
adventures
with
the
exception
of
the
present
one
and
this
is
not
yet
terminated
after
traversing
two
or
three
counties
i
reached
the
confines
of
lincolnshire
during
one
particularly
hot
day
i
put
up
at
a
to
which
in
the
evening
came
a
party
of
harvesters
to
make
merry
who
finding
me
wandering
about
the
house
a
stranger
invited
me
to
partake
of
their
ale
so
i
drank
with
the
harvesters
who
sang
me
songs
about
rural
life
such
as
sitting
in
the
swale
and
listening
to
the
swindle
of
the
flail
as
it
sounds
on
the
corn
from
the
neighbouring
barn
in
requital
for
which
i
treated
them
with
a
song
not
of
romanvile
but
the
song
of
sivory
and
the
horse
grayman
i
remained
with
them
till
it
was
dark
having
after
sunset
entered
into
deep
discourse
with
a
celebrated
ratcatcher
who
communicated
to
me
the
secrets
of
his
trade
saying
amongst
other
things
when
you
see
the
rats
pouring
out
of
their
holes
and
running
up
my
hands
and
arms
it
not
after
me
they
comes
but
after
the
oils
i
carries
about
me
they
comes
and
who
subsequently
spoke
in
the
most
enthusiastic
manner
of
his
trade
saying
that
it
was
the
best
trade
in
the
world
and
most
diverting
and
that
it
was
likely
to
last
for
ever
for
whereas
all
other
kinds
of
vermin
were
fast
disappearing
from
england
rats
were
every
day
becoming
more
abundant
i
had
quitted
this
good
company
and
having
mounted
my
horse
was
making
my
way
towards
a
town
at
about
six
miles
distance
at
a
swinging
trot
my
thoughts
deeply
engaged
on
what
i
had
gathered
from
the
ratcatcher
when
all
on
a
sudden
a
light
glared
upon
the
horse
face
who
purled
round
in
great
terror
and
flung
me
out
of
the
saddle
as
from
a
sling
or
with
as
much
violence
as
the
horse
grayman
in
the
ballad
flings
sivord
the
snareswayne
i
fell
upon
the
ground
felt
a
kind
of
crashing
about
my
neck
and
forthwith
became
senseless
chapter
xxxi
a
novel
situation
the
elderly
individual
the
surgeon
a
kind
offer
chimerical
ideas
strange
dream
how
long
i
remained
senseless
i
can
not
say
for
a
considerable
time
i
believe
at
length
opening
my
eyes
i
found
myself
lying
on
a
bed
in
a
chamber
lighted
by
a
candle
which
stood
on
a
table
an
elderly
man
stood
near
me
and
a
yet
more
elderly
female
was
holding
a
phial
of
very
pungent
salts
to
my
olfactory
organ
i
attempted
to
move
but
felt
very
stiff
my
right
arm
appeared
nearly
paralysed
and
there
was
a
strange
dull
sensation
in
my
head
you
had
better
remain
still
young
man
said
the
elderly
individual
the
surgeon
will
be
here
presently
i
have
sent
a
message
for
him
to
the
neighbouring
village
where
am
i
said
i
and
what
has
happened
you
are
in
my
house
said
the
old
man
and
you
have
been
flung
from
a
horse
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
was
the
cause
as
i
was
driving
home
the
lights
in
my
gig
frightened
the
animal
where
is
the
horse
said
i
below
in
my
stable
said
the
elderly
individual
i
saw
you
fall
but
knowing
that
on
account
of
my
age
i
could
be
of
little
use
to
you
i
instantly
hurried
home
the
accident
did
not
occur
more
than
a
furlong
off
and
procuring
the
assistance
of
my
lad
and
two
or
three
neighbouring
cottagers
i
returned
to
the
spot
where
you
were
lying
senseless
we
raised
you
up
and
brought
you
here
my
lad
then
went
in
quest
of
the
horse
who
had
run
away
as
we
drew
nigh
when
we
saw
him
first
he
was
standing
near
you
he
caught
him
with
some
difficulty
and
brought
him
home
what
are
you
about
said
the
old
man
as
i
strove
to
get
off
the
bed
i
want
to
see
the
horse
said
i
i
entreat
you
to
be
still
said
the
old
man
the
horse
is
safe
i
assure
you
i
am
thinking
about
his
knees
said
i
instead
of
thinking
about
your
horse
knees
said
the
old
man
be
thankful
that
you
have
not
broke
your
own
neck
you
do
not
talk
wisely
said
i
when
a
man
neck
is
broke
he
is
provided
for
but
when
his
horse
knees
are
broke
he
is
a
lost
jockey
that
is
if
he
has
nothing
but
his
horse
to
depend
upon
a
pretty
figure
i
should
cut
at
horncastle
mounted
on
a
horse
at
the
knees
oh
you
are
going
to
horncastle
said
the
old
man
seriously
then
i
can
sympathize
with
you
in
your
anxiety
about
your
horse
being
a
lincolnshire
man
and
the
son
of
one
who
bred
horses
i
will
myself
go
down
into
the
stable
and
examine
into
the
condition
of
your
horse
so
pray
remain
quiet
till
i
return
it
would
certainly
be
a
terrible
thing
to
appear
at
horncastle
on
a
horse
he
left
the
room
and
returned
in
about
ten
minutes
followed
by
another
person
your
horse
is
safe
said
he
and
his
knees
are
unblemished
not
a
hair
ruffled
he
is
a
fine
animal
and
will
do
credit
to
horncastle
but
here
is
the
surgeon
come
to
examine
into
your
own
condition
the
surgeon
was
a
man
about
thin
and
rather
tall
his
face
was
long
and
pale
and
his
hair
which
was
light
was
carefully
combed
back
as
much
as
possible
from
his
forehead
he
was
dressed
very
neatly
and
spoke
in
a
very
precise
tone
allow
me
to
feel
your
pulse
friend
said
he
taking
me
by
the
right
wrist
i
uttered
a
cry
for
at
the
motion
which
he
caused
a
thrill
of
agony
darted
through
my
arm
i
hope
your
arm
is
not
broke
my
friend
said
the
surgeon
allow
me
to
see
first
of
all
we
must
divest
you
of
this
cumbrous
frock
the
frock
was
removed
with
some
difficulty
and
then
the
upper
vestments
of
my
frame
with
more
difficulty
still
the
surgeon
felt
my
arm
moving
it
up
and
down
causing
me
unspeakable
pain
there
is
no
fracture
said
he
at
last
but
a
contusion
a
violent
contusion
i
am
told
you
were
going
to
horncastle
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
hardly
able
to
ride
your
horse
thither
in
time
to
dispose
of
him
however
we
shall
see
your
arm
must
be
bandaged
friend
after
which
i
shall
bleed
you
and
administer
a
composing
draught
to
be
short
the
surgeon
did
as
he
proposed
and
when
he
had
administered
the
composing
draught
he
said
be
of
good
cheer
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
you
are
yet
in
time
for
horncastle
he
then
departed
with
the
master
of
the
house
and
the
woman
leaving
me
to
my
repose
i
soon
began
to
feel
drowsy
and
was
just
composing
myself
to
slumber
lying
on
my
back
as
the
surgeon
had
advised
me
when
i
heard
steps
ascending
the
stairs
and
in
a
moment
more
the
surgeon
entered
again
followed
by
the
master
of
the
house
i
hope
i
do
disturb
you
said
the
former
my
reason
for
returning
is
to
relieve
your
mind
from
any
anxiety
with
respect
to
your
horse
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
you
will
be
able
owing
to
your
accident
to
reach
horncastle
in
time
to
quiet
you
however
i
will
buy
your
horse
for
any
reasonable
sum
i
have
been
down
to
the
stable
and
approve
of
his
figure
what
do
you
ask
for
him
this
is
a
strange
time
of
night
said
i
to
come
to
me
about
purchasing
my
horse
and
i
am
hardly
in
a
fitting
situation
to
be
applied
to
about
such
a
matter
what
do
you
want
him
for
for
my
own
use
said
the
surgeon
i
am
a
professional
man
and
am
obliged
to
be
continually
driving
about
i
cover
at
least
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
every
week
he
will
never
answer
your
purpose
said
i
he
is
not
a
driving
horse
and
was
never
between
shafts
in
his
life
he
is
for
riding
more
especially
for
trotting
at
which
he
has
few
equals
it
matters
not
to
me
whether
he
is
for
riding
or
driving
said
the
surgeon
sometimes
i
ride
sometimes
drive
so
if
we
can
come
to
terms
i
will
buy
him
though
remember
it
is
chiefly
to
remove
any
anxiety
from
your
mind
about
him
this
is
no
time
for
bargaining
said
i
if
you
wish
to
have
the
horse
for
a
hundred
guineas
you
may
if
not
a
hundred
guineas
said
the
surgeon
my
good
friend
you
must
surely
be
headed
allow
me
to
feel
your
pulse
and
he
attempted
to
feel
my
left
wrist
i
am
not
said
i
and
i
require
no
one
to
feel
my
pulse
but
i
should
be
if
i
were
to
sell
my
horse
for
less
than
i
have
demanded
but
i
have
a
curiosity
to
know
what
you
would
be
willing
to
offer
thirty
pounds
said
the
surgeon
is
all
i
can
afford
to
give
and
that
is
a
great
deal
for
a
country
surgeon
to
offer
for
a
horse
thirty
pounds
said
i
why
he
cost
me
nearly
double
that
sum
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
afraid
that
you
want
to
take
advantage
of
my
situation
not
in
the
least
friend
said
the
surgeon
not
in
the
least
i
only
wished
to
set
your
mind
at
rest
about
your
horse
but
as
you
think
he
is
worth
more
than
i
can
afford
to
offer
take
him
to
horncastle
by
all
means
i
will
do
my
best
to
cure
you
in
time
good
night
i
will
see
you
again
on
the
morrow
thereupon
he
once
more
departed
with
the
master
of
the
house
a
sharp
one
i
heard
him
say
with
a
laugh
as
the
door
closed
upon
him
left
to
myself
i
again
essayed
to
compose
myself
to
rest
but
for
some
time
in
vain
i
had
been
terribly
shaken
by
my
fall
and
had
subsequently
owing
to
the
incision
of
the
surgeon
lancet
been
deprived
of
much
of
the
vital
fluid
it
is
when
the
body
is
in
such
a
state
that
the
merest
trifles
affect
and
agitate
the
mind
no
wonder
then
that
the
return
of
the
surgeon
and
the
master
of
the
house
for
the
purpose
of
inquiring
whether
i
would
sell
my
horse
struck
me
as
being
highly
extraordinary
considering
the
hour
of
the
night
and
the
situation
in
which
they
knew
me
to
be
what
could
they
mean
by
such
conduct
did
they
wish
to
cheat
me
of
the
animal
well
well
said
i
if
they
did
what
matters
they
found
their
match
yes
yes
said
i
but
i
am
in
their
power
perhaps
but
i
instantly
dismissed
the
apprehension
which
came
into
my
mind
with
a
pooh
nonsense
in
a
little
time
however
a
far
more
foolish
and
chimerical
idea
began
to
disturb
me
the
idea
of
being
flung
from
my
horse
was
i
not
disgraced
for
ever
as
a
horseman
by
being
flung
from
my
horse
assuredly
i
thought
and
the
idea
of
being
disgraced
as
a
horseman
operating
on
my
nervous
system
caused
me
very
acute
misery
after
all
said
i
to
myself
it
was
perhaps
the
contemptible
opinion
which
the
surgeon
must
have
formed
of
my
equestrian
powers
which
induced
him
to
offer
to
take
my
horse
off
my
hands
he
perhaps
thought
i
was
unable
to
manage
a
horse
and
therefore
in
pity
returned
in
the
dead
of
night
to
offer
to
purchase
the
animal
which
had
flung
me
and
then
the
thought
that
the
surgeon
had
conceived
a
contemptible
opinion
of
my
equestrian
powers
caused
me
the
acutest
misery
and
continued
tormenting
me
until
some
other
idea
i
have
forgot
what
it
was
but
doubtless
equally
foolish
took
possession
of
my
mind
at
length
brought
on
by
the
agitation
of
my
spirits
there
came
over
me
the
same
feeling
of
horror
that
i
had
experienced
of
old
when
i
was
a
boy
and
likewise
of
late
within
the
dingle
it
was
however
not
so
violent
as
it
had
been
on
those
occasions
and
i
struggled
manfully
against
it
until
by
degrees
it
passed
away
and
then
i
fell
asleep
and
in
my
sleep
i
had
an
ugly
dream
i
dreamt
that
i
had
died
of
the
injuries
i
had
received
from
my
fall
and
that
no
sooner
had
my
soul
departed
from
my
body
than
it
entered
that
of
a
quadruped
even
my
own
horse
in
the
stable
in
a
word
i
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
my
own
steed
and
as
i
stood
in
the
stable
chewing
hay
and
i
remember
that
the
hay
was
exceedingly
tough
the
door
opened
and
the
surgeon
who
had
attended
me
came
in
my
good
animal
said
he
as
your
late
master
has
scarcely
left
enough
to
pay
for
the
expenses
of
his
funeral
and
nothing
to
remunerate
me
for
my
trouble
i
shall
make
bold
to
take
possession
of
you
if
your
paces
are
good
i
shall
keep
you
for
my
own
riding
if
not
i
shall
take
you
to
horncastle
your
original
destination
he
then
bridled
and
saddled
me
and
leading
me
out
mounted
and
then
trotted
me
up
and
down
before
the
house
at
the
door
of
which
the
old
man
who
now
appeared
to
be
dressed
in
regular
jockey
fashion
was
standing
i
like
his
paces
well
said
the
surgeon
i
think
i
shall
take
him
for
my
own
use
and
what
am
i
to
have
for
all
the
trouble
his
master
caused
me
said
my
late
entertainer
on
whose
countenance
i
now
observed
for
the
first
time
a
diabolical
squint
the
consciousness
of
having
done
your
duty
to
a
in
succouring
him
in
a
time
of
distress
must
be
your
reward
said
the
surgeon
pretty
gammon
truly
said
my
late
entertainer
what
would
you
say
if
i
were
to
talk
in
that
way
to
you
come
unless
you
choose
to
behave
jonnock
i
shall
take
the
bridle
and
lead
the
horse
back
into
the
stable
well
said
the
surgeon
we
are
old
friends
and
i
do
wish
to
dispute
with
you
so
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
will
ride
the
animal
to
horncastle
and
we
will
share
what
he
fetches
like
brothers
good
said
the
old
man
but
if
you
say
that
you
have
sold
him
for
less
than
a
hundred
i
sha
consider
you
jonnock
remember
what
the
young
fellow
said
that
young
fellow
i
heard
no
more
for
the
next
moment
i
found
myself
on
a
broad
road
leading
as
i
supposed
in
the
direction
of
horncastle
the
surgeon
still
in
the
saddle
and
my
legs
moving
at
a
rapid
trot
get
on
said
the
surgeon
jerking
my
mouth
with
the
bit
whereupon
full
of
rage
i
instantly
set
off
at
a
full
gallop
determined
if
possible
to
dash
my
rider
to
the
earth
the
surgeon
however
kept
his
seat
and
so
far
from
attempting
to
abate
my
speed
urged
me
on
to
greater
efforts
with
a
stout
stick
which
methought
he
held
in
his
hand
in
vain
did
i
rear
and
kick
attempting
to
get
rid
of
my
foe
but
the
surgeon
remained
as
fast
as
ever
the
maugrabin
sorcerer
in
the
arabian
tale
what
time
he
rode
the
young
prince
transformed
into
a
steed
to
his
enchanted
palace
in
the
wilderness
at
last
as
i
was
still
madly
dashing
on
panting
and
blowing
and
had
almost
given
up
all
hope
i
saw
at
a
distance
before
me
a
heap
of
stones
by
the
side
of
the
road
probably
placed
there
for
the
purpose
of
repairing
it
a
thought
appeared
to
strike
me
i
will
shy
at
those
stones
and
if
i
ca
get
rid
of
him
so
resign
myself
to
my
fate
so
i
increased
my
speed
till
arriving
within
about
ten
yards
of
the
heap
i
made
a
desperate
start
turning
half
round
with
nearly
the
velocity
of
a
oh
the
joy
i
experienced
when
i
felt
my
enemy
canted
over
my
neck
and
saw
him
lying
senseless
in
the
road
i
have
you
now
in
my
power
i
said
or
rather
neighed
as
going
up
to
my
prostrate
foe
i
stood
over
him
suppose
i
were
to
rear
now
and
let
my
fore
feet
fall
upon
you
what
would
your
life
be
worth
that
is
supposing
you
are
not
killed
already
but
lie
there
i
will
do
you
no
further
harm
but
trot
to
horncastle
without
a
rider
and
when
there
and
without
further
reflection
off
i
trotted
in
the
direction
of
horncastle
but
had
not
gone
far
before
my
bridle
falling
from
my
neck
got
entangled
with
my
off
fore
foot
i
felt
myself
falling
a
thrill
of
agony
shot
through
me
my
knees
would
be
broken
and
what
should
i
do
at
horncastle
with
a
pair
of
broken
knees
i
struggled
but
i
could
not
disengage
my
off
fore
foot
and
downward
i
fell
but
before
i
had
reached
the
ground
i
awoke
and
found
myself
half
out
of
bed
my
bandaged
arm
in
considerable
pain
and
my
left
hand
just
touching
the
floor
with
some
difficulty
i
readjusted
myself
in
bed
it
was
now
early
morning
and
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
were
beginning
to
penetrate
the
white
curtains
of
a
window
on
my
left
which
probably
looked
into
the
garden
as
i
caught
a
glimpse
or
two
of
the
leaves
of
trees
through
a
small
uncovered
part
at
the
side
for
some
time
i
felt
uneasy
and
anxious
my
spirits
being
in
a
strange
fluttering
state
at
last
my
eyes
fell
upon
a
small
row
of
seemingly
of
china
which
stood
on
a
mantelpiece
exactly
fronting
the
bottom
of
the
bed
the
sight
of
these
objects
i
know
not
why
soothed
and
pacified
me
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
upon
them
as
i
lay
on
my
back
on
the
bed
with
my
head
upon
the
pillow
till
at
last
i
fell
into
a
calm
and
refreshing
sleep
chapter
xxxii
the
morning
after
a
fall
the
teapot
unpretending
hospitality
the
chinese
student
it
might
be
about
eight
in
the
morning
when
i
was
awakened
by
the
entrance
of
the
old
man
how
have
you
rested
said
he
coming
up
to
the
bedside
and
looking
me
in
the
face
well
said
i
and
i
feel
much
better
but
i
am
still
very
sore
i
surveyed
him
now
for
the
first
time
with
attention
he
was
dressed
in
a
suit
and
was
apparently
between
sixty
and
seventy
in
stature
he
was
rather
above
the
middle
height
but
with
a
slight
stoop
his
features
were
placid
and
expressive
of
much
benevolence
but
as
it
appeared
to
me
with
rather
a
melancholy
cast
as
i
gazed
upon
them
i
felt
ashamed
that
i
should
ever
have
conceived
in
my
brain
a
vision
like
that
of
the
preceding
night
in
which
he
appeared
in
so
disadvantageous
a
light
at
length
he
said
it
is
now
time
for
you
to
take
some
refreshment
i
hear
my
old
servant
coming
up
with
your
breakfast
in
a
moment
the
elderly
female
entered
with
a
tray
on
which
was
some
bread
and
butter
a
teapot
and
cup
the
cup
was
of
common
blue
earthenware
but
the
pot
was
of
china
curiously
fashioned
and
seemingly
of
great
antiquity
the
old
man
poured
me
out
a
cupful
of
tea
and
then
with
the
assistance
of
the
woman
raised
me
higher
and
propped
me
up
with
the
pillows
i
ate
and
drank
when
the
pot
was
emptied
of
its
liquid
it
did
not
contain
much
i
raised
it
up
with
my
left
hand
to
inspect
it
the
sides
were
covered
with
curious
characters
seemingly
hieroglyphics
after
surveying
them
for
some
time
i
replaced
it
upon
the
tray
you
seem
fond
of
china
said
i
to
the
old
man
after
the
servant
had
retired
with
the
breakfast
things
and
i
had
returned
to
my
former
posture
you
have
china
on
the
mantelpiece
and
that
was
a
remarkable
teapot
out
of
which
i
have
just
been
drinking
the
old
man
fixed
his
eyes
intently
on
me
and
methought
the
expression
of
his
countenance
became
yet
more
melancholy
yes
said
he
at
last
i
am
fond
of
china
i
have
reason
to
be
fond
of
china
but
for
china
i
should
and
here
he
sighed
again
you
value
it
for
the
quaintness
and
singularity
of
its
form
said
i
it
appears
to
be
less
adapted
for
real
use
than
our
own
pottery
i
care
little
about
its
form
said
the
old
man
i
care
for
it
simply
on
account
of
however
why
talk
to
you
on
the
subject
which
can
have
no
possible
interest
to
you
i
expect
the
surgeon
here
presently
i
do
not
like
that
surgeon
at
all
said
i
how
strangely
he
behaved
last
night
coming
back
when
i
was
just
falling
asleep
to
ask
me
if
i
would
sell
my
horse
the
old
man
smiled
he
has
but
one
failing
said
he
an
itch
for
but
for
that
he
might
be
a
much
richer
man
than
he
is
he
is
continually
buying
and
exchanging
horses
and
generally
finds
himself
a
loser
by
his
bargains
but
he
is
a
worthy
creature
and
skilful
in
his
profession
it
is
well
for
you
that
you
are
under
his
care
the
old
man
then
left
me
and
in
about
an
hour
returned
with
the
surgeon
who
examined
me
and
reported
favourably
as
to
my
case
he
spoke
to
me
with
kindness
and
feeling
and
did
not
introduce
the
subject
of
the
horse
i
asked
him
whether
he
thought
i
should
be
in
time
for
the
fair
i
saw
some
people
making
their
way
thither
said
he
the
fair
lasts
three
weeks
and
it
has
just
commenced
yes
i
think
i
may
promise
you
that
you
will
be
in
time
for
the
very
heat
of
it
in
a
few
days
you
will
be
able
to
mount
your
saddle
with
your
arm
in
a
sling
but
you
must
by
no
means
appear
with
your
arm
in
a
sling
at
horncastle
as
people
would
think
that
your
horse
had
flung
you
and
that
you
wanted
to
dispose
of
him
because
he
was
a
vicious
brute
you
must
by
all
means
drop
the
sling
before
you
get
to
horncastle
for
three
days
i
kept
my
apartment
by
the
advice
of
the
surgeon
i
passed
my
time
as
i
best
could
stretched
on
my
bed
i
either
abandoned
myself
to
reflection
or
listened
to
the
voices
of
the
birds
in
the
neighbouring
garden
sometimes
as
i
lay
awake
at
night
i
would
endeavour
to
catch
the
tick
of
a
clock
which
methought
sounded
from
some
distant
part
of
the
house
the
old
man
visited
me
twice
or
thrice
every
day
to
inquire
into
my
state
his
words
were
few
on
these
occasions
and
he
did
not
stay
long
yet
his
voice
and
his
words
were
kind
what
surprised
me
most
in
connection
with
this
individual
was
the
delicacy
of
conduct
which
he
exhibited
in
not
letting
a
word
proceed
from
his
lips
which
could
testify
curiosity
respecting
who
i
was
or
whence
i
came
all
he
knew
of
me
was
that
i
had
been
flung
from
my
horse
on
my
way
to
a
fair
for
the
purpose
of
disposing
of
the
animal
and
that
i
was
now
his
guest
i
might
be
a
common
for
what
he
knew
yet
i
was
treated
by
him
with
all
the
attention
which
i
could
have
expected
had
i
been
an
alderman
of
boston
heir
and
known
to
him
as
such
the
county
in
which
i
am
now
thought
i
at
last
must
be
either
extraordinarily
devoted
to
hospitality
or
this
old
host
of
mine
must
be
an
extraordinary
individual
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day
feeling
tired
of
my
confinement
i
put
my
clothes
on
in
the
best
manner
i
could
and
left
the
chamber
descending
a
flight
of
stairs
i
reached
a
kind
of
quadrangle
from
which
branched
two
or
three
passages
one
of
these
i
entered
which
had
a
door
at
the
farther
end
and
one
on
each
side
the
one
to
the
left
standing
partly
open
i
entered
it
and
found
myself
in
a
room
with
a
large
window
or
rather
which
looked
into
a
garden
and
which
stood
open
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
this
room
except
a
large
quantity
of
china
there
was
china
on
the
mantelpiece
china
on
two
tables
and
a
small
beaufet
which
stood
opposite
the
was
covered
with
china
there
were
cups
teapots
and
vases
of
various
forms
and
on
all
of
them
i
observed
characters
not
a
teapot
not
a
not
a
vase
of
whatever
form
or
size
but
appeared
to
possess
hieroglyphics
on
some
part
or
other
after
surveying
these
articles
for
some
time
with
no
little
interest
i
passed
into
the
garden
in
which
there
were
small
parterres
of
flowers
and
two
or
three
trees
and
which
where
the
house
did
not
abut
was
bounded
by
a
wall
turning
to
the
right
by
a
walk
by
the
side
of
a
house
i
passed
by
a
door
probably
the
one
i
had
seen
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
arrived
at
another
window
similar
to
that
through
which
i
had
come
and
which
also
stood
open
i
was
about
to
pass
through
it
when
i
heard
the
voice
of
my
entertainer
exclaiming
is
that
you
pray
come
in
i
entered
the
room
which
seemed
to
be
a
counterpart
of
the
one
which
i
had
just
left
it
was
of
the
same
size
had
the
same
kind
of
furniture
and
appeared
to
be
equally
well
stocked
with
china
one
prominent
article
it
possessed
however
which
the
other
room
did
not
exhibit
namely
a
clock
which
with
its
pendulum
moving
hung
against
the
wall
opposite
to
the
door
the
sight
of
which
made
me
conclude
that
the
sound
which
methought
i
had
heard
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
was
not
an
imaginary
one
there
it
hung
on
the
wall
with
its
pendulum
moving
the
old
gentleman
was
seated
in
an
easy
chair
a
little
way
into
the
room
having
the
on
his
right
hand
on
a
table
before
him
lay
a
large
open
volume
in
which
i
observed
roman
letters
as
well
as
characters
a
few
inches
beyond
the
book
on
the
table
covered
all
over
with
hieroglyphics
stood
a
china
vase
the
eyes
of
the
old
man
were
fixed
upon
it
sit
down
said
he
motioning
me
with
his
hand
to
a
stool
close
by
but
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
vase
i
ca
make
it
out
said
he
at
last
removing
his
eyes
from
the
vase
and
leaning
back
on
the
chair
i
ca
make
it
out
i
wish
i
could
assist
you
said
i
assist
me
said
the
old
man
looking
at
me
with
a
half
smile
yes
said
i
but
i
do
understand
chinese
i
suppose
not
said
the
old
man
with
another
slight
smile
but
but
pray
proceed
said
i
i
wished
to
ask
you
said
the
old
man
how
you
knew
that
the
characters
on
yon
piece
of
crockery
were
chinese
or
indeed
that
there
was
such
a
language
i
knew
the
crockery
was
china
said
i
and
naturally
enough
supposed
what
was
written
upon
it
to
be
chinese
as
for
there
being
such
a
language
the
english
have
a
language
the
french
have
a
language
and
why
not
the
chinese
may
i
ask
you
a
question
as
many
as
you
like
do
you
know
any
language
besides
english
yes
said
i
i
know
a
little
of
two
or
three
may
i
ask
their
names
why
not
said
i
i
know
a
little
french
anything
else
yes
a
little
welsh
and
a
little
haik
what
is
haik
armenian
i
am
glad
to
see
you
in
my
house
said
the
old
man
shaking
me
by
the
hand
how
singular
that
one
coming
as
you
did
should
know
armenian
not
more
singular
said
i
than
that
one
living
in
such
a
place
as
this
should
know
chinese
how
came
you
to
acquire
it
the
old
man
looked
at
me
and
sighed
i
beg
pardon
said
i
for
asking
what
is
perhaps
an
impertinent
question
i
have
not
imitated
your
own
delicacy
you
have
never
asked
me
a
question
without
first
desiring
permission
and
here
i
have
been
days
and
nights
in
your
house
an
intruder
on
your
hospitality
and
you
have
never
so
much
as
asked
me
who
i
am
in
forbearing
to
do
that
said
the
old
man
i
merely
obeyed
the
chinese
precept
no
questions
of
a
guest
it
is
written
on
both
sides
of
the
teapot
out
of
which
you
have
had
your
tea
i
wish
i
knew
chinese
said
i
is
it
a
difficult
language
to
acquire
i
have
reason
to
think
so
said
the
old
man
i
have
been
occupied
upon
it
years
and
i
am
still
very
imperfectly
acquainted
with
it
at
least
i
frequently
find
upon
my
crockery
sentences
the
meaning
of
which
to
me
is
very
dark
though
it
is
true
these
sentences
are
mostly
verses
which
are
of
course
more
difficult
to
understand
than
mere
prose
are
your
chinese
studies
said
i
confined
to
crockery
literature
entirely
said
the
old
man
i
read
nothing
else
i
have
heard
said
i
that
the
chinese
have
no
letters
but
that
for
every
word
they
have
a
separate
character
is
it
so
for
every
word
they
have
a
particular
character
said
the
old
man
though
to
prevent
confusion
they
have
arranged
their
words
under
two
hundred
and
fourteen
what
we
should
call
radicals
but
which
they
call
keys
as
we
arrange
all
our
words
in
a
dictionary
under
letters
so
do
they
arrange
all
their
words
or
characters
under
two
hundred
and
fourteen
radical
signs
the
simplest
radicals
being
the
first
and
the
more
complex
the
last
does
the
chinese
resemble
any
of
the
european
languages
in
words
said
i
i
am
scarcely
competent
to
inform
you
said
the
old
man
but
i
believe
not
what
does
that
character
represent
said
i
pointing
to
one
on
the
vase
a
knife
said
the
old
man
that
character
is
one
of
the
simplest
radicals
or
keys
and
what
is
the
sound
of
it
said
i
tau
said
the
old
man
tau
said
i
tau
a
strange
word
for
a
knife
is
it
not
said
the
old
man
tawse
said
i
tawse
what
is
tawse
said
the
old
man
you
were
never
at
school
at
edinburgh
i
suppose
never
said
the
old
man
that
accounts
for
your
not
knowing
the
meaning
of
tawse
said
i
had
you
received
the
rudiments
of
a
classical
education
at
the
high
school
you
would
have
known
the
meaning
of
tawse
full
well
it
is
a
leathern
thong
with
which
refractory
urchins
are
recalled
to
a
sense
of
their

the

how
singular
i
can
not
see
what
the
two
words
have
in
common
except
a
slight
agreement
in
sound
you
will
see
the
connection
said
i
when
i
inform
you
that
the
thong
from
the
middle

history
two
days
three
days
passed
away
and
i
still
remained
at
the
house
of
my
hospitable
entertainer
my
bruised
limb
rapidly
recovering
the
power
of
performing
its
functions
i
passed
my
time
agreeably
enough
sometimes
in
my
chamber
communing
with
my
own
thoughts
sometimes
in
the
stable
attending
to
and
not
unfrequently
conversing
with
my
horse
and
at
time
for
i
seldom
saw
him
at
any
other
discoursing
with
the
old
gentleman
sometimes
on
the
chinese
vocabulary
sometimes
on
chinese
syntax
and
once
or
twice
on
english
horseflesh
though
on
this
latter
subject
notwithstanding
his
descent
from
a
race
of
he
did
not
enter
into
with
much
alacrity
as
a
small
requital
for
his
kindness
i
gave
him
one
day
after
dinner
unasked
a
brief
account
of
my
history
and
pursuits
he
listened
with
attention
and
when
it
was
concluded
thanked
me
for
the
confidence
which
i
had
reposed
in
him
such
conduct
said
he
deserves
a
return
i
will
tell
you
my
own
history
it
is
brief
but
may
perhaps
not
prove
uninteresting
to
you
though
the
relation
of
it
will
give
me
some
pain
pray
then
do
not
recite
it
said
i
yes
said
the
old
man
i
will
tell
you
for
i
wish
you
to
know
it
he
was
about
to
begin
when
he
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
surgeon
the
surgeon
examined
into
the
state
of
my
bruised
limb
and
told
me
what
indeed
i
already
well
knew
that
it
was
rapidly
improving
you
will
not
even
require
a
sling
said
he
to
ride
to
horncastle
when
do
you
propose
going
he
demanded
when
do
you
think
i
may
venture
i
replied
i
think
if
you
are
a
tolerably
good
horseman
you
may
mount
the
day
after
answered
the
medical
man
are
you
acquainted
with
anybody
at
horncastle
with
no
living
soul
i
answered
then
you
would
scarcely
find
for
your
horse
but
i
am
happy
to
be
able
to
assist
you
i
have
a
friend
there
who
keeps
a
small
inn
and
who
during
the
time
of
the
fair
keeps
a
stall
vacant
for
any
quadruped
i
may
bring
until
he
knows
whether
i
am
coming
or
not
i
will
give
you
a
letter
to
him
and
he
will
see
after
the
accommodation
of
your
horse
i
will
pay
you
a
farewell
visit
and
bring
you
the
letter
thank
you
said
i
and
do
not
forget
to
bring
your
bill
the
surgeon
looked
at
the
old
man
who
gave
him
a
peculiar
nod
oh
said
he
in
reply
to
me
for
the
little
service
i
have
rendered
you
i
require
no
remuneration
you
are
in
my
friend
house
and
he
and
i
understand
each
other
i
never
receive
such
favours
said
i
as
you
have
rendered
me
without
remunerating
them
therefore
i
shall
expect
your
bill
oh
just
as
you
please
said
the
surgeon
and
shaking
me
by
the
hand
more
warmly
than
he
had
hitherto
done
he
took
his
leave
on
the
evening
of
the
next
day
the
last
which
i
spent
with
my
kind
entertainer
i
sat
at
tea
with
him
in
a
little
in
his
garden
partially
shaded
by
the
boughs
of
a
large
the
surgeon
had
shortly
before
paid
me
his
farewell
visit
and
had
brought
me
the
letter
of
introduction
to
his
friend
at
horncastle
and
also
his
bill
which
i
found
anything
but
extravagant
after
we
had
each
respectively
drank
the
contents
of
two
cups
and
it
may
not
be
amiss
here
to
inform
the
reader
that
though
i
took
cream
with
my
tea
as
i
always
do
when
i
can
procure
that
addition
the
old
man
like
most
people
bred
up
in
the
country
drank
his
without
it
he
thus
addressed
me
i
am
as
i
told
you
on
the
night
of
your
accident
the
son
of
a
breeder
of
horses
a
respectable
and
honest
man
when
i
was
about
twenty
he
died
leaving
me
his
only
child
a
comfortable
property
consisting
of
about
two
hundred
acres
of
land
and
some
fifteen
hundred
pounds
in
money
my
mother
had
died
about
three
years
previously
i
felt
the
death
of
my
mother
keenly
but
that
of
my
father
less
than
was
my
duty
indeed
truth
compels
me
to
acknowledge
that
i
scarcely
regretted
his
death
the
cause
of
this
want
of
proper
filial
feeling
was
the
opposition
which
i
had
experienced
from
him
in
an
affair
which
deeply
concerned
me
i
had
formed
an
attachment
for
a
young
female
in
the
neighbourhood
who
though
poor
was
of
highly
respectable
birth
her
father
having
been
a
curate
of
the
established
church
she
was
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
speaking
an
orphan
having
lost
both
her
parents
and
supported
herself
by
keeping
a
small
school
my
attachment
was
returned
and
we
had
pledged
our
vows
but
my
father
who
could
not
reconcile
himself
to
her
lack
of
fortune
forbade
our
marriage
in
the
most
positive
terms
he
was
wrong
for
she
was
a
fortune
in
herself
amiable
and
accomplished
oh
i
can
not
tell
you
all
she
was
and
here
the
old
man
drew
his
hand
across
his
eyes
by
the
death
of
my
father
the
only
obstacle
to
our
happiness
appeared
to
be
removed
we
agreed
therefore
that
our
marriage
should
take
place
within
the
course
of
a
year
and
i
forthwith
commenced
enlarging
my
house
and
getting
my
affairs
in
order
having
been
left
in
the
easy
circumstances
which
i
have
described
i
determined
to
follow
no
business
but
to
pass
my
life
in
a
strictly
domestic
manner
and
to
be
very
very
happy
amongst
other
property
derived
from
my
father
were
several
horses
which
i
disposed
of
in
this
neighbourhood
with
the
exception
of
two
remarkably
fine
ones
which
i
determined
to
take
to
the
next
fair
at
horncastle
the
only
place
where
i
expected
to
be
able
to
obtain
what
i
considered
to
be
their
full
value
at
length
the
time
arrived
for
the
commencement
of
the
fair
which
was
within
three
months
of
the
period
which
my
beloved
and
myself
had
fixed
upon
for
the
celebration
of
our
nuptials
to
the
fair
i
went
a
couple
of
trusty
men
following
me
with
the
horses
i
soon
found
a
purchaser
for
the
animals
a
portly
plausible
person
of
about
forty
dressed
in
a
blue
riding
coat
brown
top
boots
and
leather
breeches
there
was
a
urchin
with
him
attired
in
nearly
similar
fashion
with
a
beam
in
one
of
his
eyes
who
called
him
father
the
man
paid
me
for
the
purchase
in
three
notes
for
the
two
horses
as
we
were
about
to
take
leave
of
each
other
he
suddenly
produced
another
note
inquiring
whether
i
could
change
it
complaining
at
the
same
time
of
the
difficulty
of
procuring
change
in
the
fair
as
i
happened
to
have
plenty
of
small
money
in
my
possession
and
as
i
felt
obliged
to
him
for
having
purchased
my
horses
at
what
i
considered
to
be
a
good
price
i
informed
him
that
i
should
be
very
happy
to
accommodate
him
so
i
changed
him
the
note
and
he
having
taken
possession
of
the
horses
went
his
way
and
i
myself
returned
home
a
month
passed
during
this
time
i
paid
away
two
of
the
notes
which
i
had
received
at
horncastle
from
the
dealer
one
of
them
in
my
immediate
neighbourhood
and
the
other
at
a
town
about
fifteen
miles
distant
to
which
i
had
repaired
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
some
furniture
all
things
seemed
to
be
going
on
most
prosperously
and
i
felt
quite
happy
when
one
morning
as
i
was
overlooking
some
workmen
who
were
employed
about
my
house
i
was
accosted
by
a
constable
who
informed
me
that
he
was
sent
to
request
my
immediate
appearance
before
a
neighbouring
bench
of
magistrates
concluding
that
i
was
merely
summoned
on
some
unimportant
business
connected
with
the
neighbourhood
i
felt
no
surprise
and
forthwith
departed
in
company
with
the
officer
the
demeanour
of
the
man
upon
the
way
struck
me
as
somewhat
singular
i
had
frequently
spoken
to
him
before
and
had
always
found
him
civil
and
respectful
but
he
was
now
reserved
and
sullen
and
replied
to
two
or
three
questions
which
i
put
to
him
in
anything
but
a
courteous
manner
on
arriving
at
the
place
where
the
magistrates
were
sitting
an
inn
at
a
small
town
about
two
miles
distant
i
found
a
more
than
usual
number
of
people
assembled
who
appeared
to
be
conversing
with
considerable
eagerness
at
sight
of
me
they
became
silent
but
crowded
after
me
as
i
followed
the
man
into
the
magistrates
room
there
i
found
the
tradesman
to
whom
i
had
paid
the
note
for
the
furniture
at
the
town
fifteen
miles
off
in
attendance
accompanied
by
an
agent
of
the
bank
of
england
the
former
it
seems
had
paid
the
note
into
a
provincial
bank
the
proprietors
of
which
discovering
it
to
be
a
forgery
had
forthwith
written
up
to
the
bank
of
england
who
had
sent
down
their
agent
to
investigate
the
matter
a
third
individual
stood
beside
them
the
person
in
my
own
immediate
neighbourhood
to
whom
i
had
paid
the
second
note
this
by
some
means
or
other
before
the
coming
down
of
the
agent
had
found
its
way
to
the
same
provincial
bank
and
also
being
pronounced
a
forgery
it
had
speedily
been
traced
to
the
person
to
whom
i
had
paid
it
it
was
owing
to
the
apparition
of
this
second
note
that
the
agent
had
determined
without
further
inquiry
to
cause
me
to
be
summoned
before
the
rural
tribunal
in
a
few
words
the
magistrates
clerk
gave
me
to
understand
the
state
of
the
case
i
was
filled
with
surprise
and
consternation
i
knew
myself
to
be
perfectly
innocent
of
any
fraudulent
intention
but
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
speaking
it
was
a
matter
fraught
with
the
greatest
danger
to
be
mixed
up
however
innocently
with
the
passing
of
false
money
the
law
with
respect
to
forgery
was
terribly
severe
and
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty
occasionally
suffered
of
this
i
was
not
altogether
ignorant
unfortunately
however
in
my
transactions
with
the
stranger
the
idea
of
false
notes
being
offered
to
me
and
my
being
brought
into
trouble
by
means
of
them
never
entered
my
mind
recovering
myself
a
little
i
stated
that
the
notes
in
question
were
two
of
three
notes
which
i
had
received
at
horncastle
for
a
pair
of
horses
which
it
was
well
known
i
had
carried
thither
thereupon
i
produced
from
my
the
third
note
which
was
forthwith
pronounced
a
forgery
i
had
scarcely
produced
the
third
note
when
i
remembered
the
one
which
i
had
changed
for
the
horncastle
dealer
and
with
the
remembrance
came
the
almost
certain
conviction
that
it
was
also
a
forgery
i
was
tempted
for
a
moment
to
produce
it
and
to
explain
the
circumstance
would
to
god
i
had
done
so
but
shame
at
the
idea
of
having
been
so
wretchedly
duped
prevented
me
and
the
opportunity
was
lost
i
must
confess
that
the
agent
of
the
bank
behaved
upon
the
whole
in
a
very
handsome
manner
he
said
that
as
it
was
quite
evident
that
i
had
disposed
of
certain
horses
at
the
fair
it
was
very
probable
that
i
might
have
received
the
notes
in
question
in
exchange
for
them
and
that
he
was
willing
as
he
had
received
a
very
excellent
account
of
my
general
conduct
to
press
the
matter
no
farther
that
is
provided
and
here
he
stopped
thereupon
one
of
the
three
magistrates
who
were
present
asked
me
whether
i
chanced
to
have
any
more
of
these
spurious
notes
in
my
possession
he
certainly
had
a
right
to
ask
the
question
but
there
was
something
peculiar
in
his
suspicion
it
is
certainly
difficult
to
judge
of
the
motives
which
rule
a
person
conduct
but
i
can
not
help
imagining
that
he
was
somewhat
influenced
in
his
behaviour
on
that
occasion
which
was
anything
but
friendly
by
my
having
refused
to
sell
him
the
horses
at
a
price
less
than
that
which
i
expected
to
get
at
the
fair
be
this
as
it
may
the
question
filled
me
with
embarrassment
and
i
bitterly
repented
not
having
at
first
been
more
explicit
thereupon
the
magistrate
in
the
same
kind
of
tone
demanded
to
see
my
i
knew
that
to
demur
would
be
useless
and
produced
it
and
therewith
amongst
two
or
three
small
country
notes
appeared
the
fourth
which
i
had
received
from
the
horncastle
dealer
the
agent
took
it
up
and
examined
it
with
attention
is
it
a
genuine
note
asked
the
magistrate
am
sorry
to
say
that
it
is
not
said
the
agent
is
a
forgery
like
the
other
three
the
magistrate
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
indeed
did
several
people
in
the
room
regular
dealer
in
forged
notes
said
a
person
close
behind
me
would
have
thought
it
seeing
matters
begin
to
look
so
serious
i
aroused
myself
and
endeavoured
to
speak
in
my
own
behalf
giving
a
candid
account
of
the
manner
in
which
i
became
possessed
of
the
notes
but
my
explanation
did
not
appear
to
meet
much
credit
the
magistrate
to
whom
i
have
in
particular
alluded
asked
why
i
had
not
at
once
stated
the
fact
of
my
having
received
a
fourth
note
and
the
agent
though
in
a
very
quiet
tone
observed
that
he
could
not
help
thinking
it
somewhat
strange
that
i
should
have
changed
a
note
of
so
much
value
for
a
perfect
stranger
even
supposing
that
he
had
purchased
my
horses
and
had
paid
me
their
value
in
hard
cash
and
i
noticed
that
he
laid
particular
emphasis
on
the
last
words
i
might
have
observed
that
i
was
an
inexperienced
young
man
who
meaning
no
harm
myself
suspected
none
in
others
but
i
was
confused
stunned
and
my
tongue
seemed
to
cleave
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
the
men
who
had
taken
my
horses
to
horncastle
and
for
whom
i
had
sent
as
they
lived
close
at
hand
now
arrived
but
the
evidence
which
they
could
give
was
anything
but
conclusive
in
my
favour
they
had
seen
me
in
company
with
an
individual
at
horncastle
to
whom
by
my
orders
they
had
delivered
certain
horses
but
they
had
seen
no
part
of
the
money
transaction
the
fellow
whether
from
design
or
not
having
taken
me
aside
into
a
retired
place
where
he
had
paid
me
the
three
spurious
notes
and
induced
me
to
change
the
fourth
which
throughout
the
affair
was
what
bore
most
materially
against
me
how
matters
might
have
terminated
i
do
not
know
i
might
have
gone
to
prison
and
i
might
have
been
just
then
when
i
most
needed
a
friend
and
least
expected
to
find
one
for
though
amongst
those
present
there
were
several
who
were
my
neighbours
and
who
had
professed
friendship
for
me
none
of
them
when
they
saw
that
i
needed
support
and
encouragement
came
forward
to
yield
me
any
but
on
the
contrary
appeared
by
their
looks
to
enjoy
my
terror
and
confusion
just
then
a
friend
entered
the
room
in
the
person
of
the
surgeon
of
the
neighbourhood
the
father
of
him
who
has
attended
you
he
was
not
on
very
intimate
terms
with
me
but
he
had
occasionally
spoken
to
me
and
had
attended
my
father
in
his
dying
illness
and
chancing
to
hear
that
i
was
in
trouble
he
now
hastened
to
assist
me
after
a
short
preamble
in
which
he
apologized
to
the
bench
for
interfering
he
begged
to
be
informed
of
the
state
of
the
case
whereupon
the
matter
was
laid
before
him
in
all
its
details
he
was
not
slow
in
taking
a
fair
view
of
it
and
spoke
well
and
eloquently
in
my
behalf
insisting
on
the
improbability
that
a
person
of
my
habits
and
position
would
be
wilfully
mixed
up
with
a
transaction
like
that
of
which
it
appeared
i
was
suspected
adding
that
as
he
was
fully
convinced
of
my
innocence
he
was
ready
to
enter
into
any
surety
with
respect
to
my
appearance
at
any
time
to
answer
anything
which
might
be
laid
to
my
charge
this
last
observation
had
particular
effect
and
as
he
was
a
person
universally
respected
both
for
his
skill
in
his
profession
and
his
general
demeanour
people
began
to
think
that
a
person
in
whom
he
took
an
interest
could
scarcely
be
concerned
in
anything
criminal
and
though
my
friend
the
magistrate
i
call
him
so
ironically
made
two
or
three
demurs
it
was
at
last
agreed
between
him
and
his
brethren
of
the
bench
that
for
the
present
i
should
be
merely
called
upon
to
enter
into
my
own
recognizance
for
the
sum
of
two
hundred
pounds
to
appear
whenever
it
should
be
deemed
requisite
to
enter
into
any
further
investigation
of
the
matter
so
i
was
permitted
to
depart
from
the
tribunal
of
petty
justice
without
handcuffs
and
uncollared
by
a
constable
but
people
looked
coldly
and
suspiciously
upon
me
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
hasten
to
the
house
of
my
beloved
in
order
to
inform
her
of
every
circumstance
attending
the
transaction
i
found
her
but
how
a
malicious
female
individual
had
hurried
to
her
with
a
distorted
tale
to
the
effect
that
i
had
been
taken
up
as
an
utterer
of
forged
notes
that
an
immense
number
had
been
found
in
my
possession
that
i
was
already
committed
and
that
probably
i
should
be
executed
my
affianced
one
tenderly
loved
me
and
her
constitution
was
delicate
fit
succeeded
fit
she
broke
a
and
i
found
her
deluged
in
blood
the
surgeon
had
been
sent
for
he
came
and
afforded
her
every
possible
relief
i
was
distracted
he
bade
me
have
hope
but
i
observed
he
looked
very
grave
by
the
skill
of
the
surgeon
the
poor
girl
was
saved
in
the
first
instance
from
the
arms
of
death
and
for
a
few
weeks
she
appeared
to
be
rapidly
recovering
by
degrees
however
she
became
melancholy
a
worm
preyed
upon
her
spirit
a
slow
fever
took
possession
of
her
frame
i
subsequently
learned
that
the
same
malicious
female
who
had
first
carried
to
her
an
exaggerated
account
of
the
affair
and
who
was
a
distant
relative
of
her
own
frequently
visited
her
and
did
all
in
her
power
to
excite
her
fears
with
respect
to
its
eventual
termination
time
passed
on
in
a
very
wretched
manner
our
friend
the
surgeon
showing
to
us
both
every
mark
of
kindness
and
attention
it
was
owing
to
this
excellent
man
that
my
innocence
was
eventually
established
having
been
called
to
a
town
on
the
borders
of
yorkshire
to
a
medical
consultation
he
chanced
to
be
taking
a
glass
of
wine
with
the
landlord
of
the
inn
at
which
he
stopped
when
the
waiter
brought
in
a
note
to
be
changed
saying
the
quaker
gentleman
who
had
been
for
some
days
in
the
house
and
was
about
to
depart
had
sent
it
to
be
changed
in
order
that
he
might
pay
his
bill
the
landlord
took
the
note
and
looked
at
it
bill
said
he
do
like
changing
bills
of
that
amount
lest
they
should
prove
bad
ones
however
as
it
comes
from
a
quaker
gentleman
i
suppose
it
is
all
right
the
mention
of
a
note
aroused
the
attention
of
my
friend
and
he
requested
to
be
permitted
to
look
at
it
he
had
scarcely
seen
it
when
he
was
convinced
that
it
was
one
of
the
same
description
as
those
which
had
brought
me
into
trouble
as
it
corresponded
with
them
in
two
particular
features
which
the
agent
of
the
bank
had
pointed
out
to
him
and
others
as
evidence
of
their
spuriousness
my
friend
without
a
hesitation
informed
the
landlord
that
the
note
was
a
bad
one
expressing
at
the
same
time
a
great
wish
to
see
the
quaker
gentleman
who
wanted
to
have
it
changed
you
can
easily
do
said
the
landlord
and
forthwith
conducted
him
into
the
common
room
where
he
saw
a
looking
man
dressed
like
a
quaker
and
seemingly
about
sixty
years
of
age
my
friend
after
a
short
apology
showed
him
the
note
which
he
held
in
his
hand
stating
that
he
had
no
doubt
it
was
a
spurious
one
and
begged
to
be
informed
where
he
had
taken
it
adding
that
a
particular
friend
of
his
was
at
present
in
trouble
owing
to
his
having
taken
similar
notes
from
a
stranger
at
horncastle
but
that
he
hoped
that
he
the
quaker
could
give
information
by
means
of
which
the
guilty
party
or
parties
could
be
arrested
at
the
mention
of
horncastle
it
appeared
to
my
friend
that
the
quaker
gave
a
slight
start
at
the
conclusion
of
this
speech
however
he
answered
with
great
tranquillity
that
he
had
received
it
in
the
way
of
business
at
naming
one
of
the
principal
towns
in
yorkshire
from
a
very
respectable
person
whose
name
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
communicate
and
likewise
his
own
which
he
said
was
james
and
that
he
was
a
merchant
residing
at
liverpool
that
he
would
write
to
his
friend
at
requesting
him
to
make
inquiries
on
the
subject
that
just
at
that
moment
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
depart
having
some
particular
business
at
a
town
about
ten
miles
off
to
go
to
which
he
had
bespoken
a
of
the
landlord
that
with
respect
to
the
note
it
was
doubtless
a
very
disagreeable
thing
to
have
a
suspicious
one
in
his
possession
but
that
it
would
make
little
difference
to
him
as
he
had
plenty
of
other
money
and
thereupon
he
pulled
out
a
purse
containing
various
other
notes
and
some
gold
observing
his
only
motive
for
wishing
to
change
the
other
note
was
a
desire
to
be
well
provided
with
change
and
finally
that
if
they
had
any
suspicion
with
respect
to
him
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
leave
the
note
in
their
possession
till
he
should
return
which
he
intended
to
do
in
about
a
fortnight
there
was
so
much
plausibility
in
the
speech
of
the
quaker
and
his
appearance
and
behaviour
were
so
perfectly
respectable
that
my
friend
felt
almost
ashamed
of
the
suspicion
which
at
first
he
had
entertained
of
him
though
at
the
same
time
he
felt
an
unaccountable
unwillingness
to
let
the
man
depart
without
some
further
interrogation
the
landlord
however
who
did
not
wish
to
disoblige
one
who
had
been
and
might
probably
be
again
a
profitable
customer
declared
that
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
and
that
he
had
no
wish
to
detain
the
note
which
he
made
no
doubt
the
gentleman
had
received
in
the
way
of
business
and
that
as
the
matter
concerned
him
alone
he
would
leave
it
to
him
to
make
the
necessary
inquiries
as
you
please
friend
said
the
quaker
pocketing
the
suspicious
note
will
now
pay
my
bill
thereupon
he
discharged
the
bill
with
a
note
which
he
begged
the
landlord
to
inspect
carefully
and
with
two
pieces
of
gold
the
landlord
had
just
taken
the
money
receipted
the
bill
and
was
bowing
to
his
customer
when
the
door
opened
and
a
lad
dressed
in
a
kind
of
grey
livery
appeared
and
informed
the
quaker
that
the
chaise
was
ready
that
boy
your
servant
said
the
surgeon
is
friend
said
the
quaker
thou
any
reason
for
asking
me
that
question
has
he
been
long
in
your
service
years
replied
the
quaker
took
him
into
my
house
out
of
compassion
he
being
an
orphan
but
as
the
chaise
is
waiting
i
will
bid
thee
farewell
am
afraid
i
must
stop
your
journey
for
the
present
said
the
surgeon
boy
has
exactly
the
same
blemish
in
the
eye
which
a
boy
had
who
was
in
company
with
the
man
at
horncastle
from
whom
my
friend
received
the
forged
notes
and
who
there
passed
for
his
son
know
nothing
about
that
said
the
quaker
i
am
determined
to
be
detained
here
no
longer
after
the
satisfactory
account
which
i
have
given
as
to
the
note
coming
into
my
possession
he
then
attempted
to
leave
the
room
but
my
friend
detained
him
a
struggle
ensued
during
which
a
wig
which
the
quaker
wore
fell
off
whereupon
he
instantly
appeared
to
lose
some
twenty
years
of
his
age
the
fellow
down
father
said
the
boy
help
you
and
forsooth
the
pretended
quaker
took
the
boy
advice
and
knocked
my
friend
down
in
a
twinkling
the
landlord
however
and
waiter
seeing
how
matters
stood
instantly
laid
hold
of
him
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
would
have
escaped
from
the
whole
three
had
not
certain
guests
who
were
in
the
house
hearing
the
noise
rushed
in
and
helped
to
secure
him
the
boy
was
true
to
his
word
assisting
him
to
the
best
of
his
ability
flinging
himself
between
the
legs
of
his
father
assailants
causing
several
of
them
to
stumble
and
fall
at
length
the
fellow
was
secured
and
led
before
a
magistrate
the
boy
to
whom
he
was
heard
to
say
something
which
nobody
understood
and
to
whom
after
the
capture
no
one
paid
much
attention
was
no
more
seen
the
rest
as
far
as
this
man
was
concerned
may
be
told
in
a
few
words
nothing
to
criminate
him
was
found
on
his
person
but
on
his
baggage
being
examined
a
quantity
of
spurious
notes
were
discovered
much
of
his
hardihood
now
forsook
him
and
in
the
hope
of
saving
his
life
he
made
some
very
important
disclosures
amongst
other
things
he
confessed
that
it
was
he
who
had
given
me
the
notes
in
exchange
for
the
horses
and
also
the
note
to
be
changed
he
was
subsequently
tried
on
two
indictments
in
the
second
of
which
i
appeared
against
him
he
was
condemned
to
die
but
in
consideration
of
the
disclosures
he
had
made
his
sentence
was
commuted
to
perpetual
transportation
my
innocence
was
thus
perfectly
established
before
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
all
my
friends
hastened
to
congratulate
me
there
was
one
who
congratulated
me
more
than
all
the
rest
it
was
my
beloved
one
but
but
she
was
dying
here
the
old
man
drew
his
hand
before
his
eyes
and
remained
for
some
time
without
speaking
at
length
he
removed
his
hand
and
commenced
again
with
a
broken
voice
you
will
pardon
me
if
i
hurry
over
this
part
of
my
story
i
am
unable
to
dwell
upon
it
how
dwell
upon
a
period
when
i
saw
my
only
earthly
treasure
pine
away
gradually
day
by
day
and
knew
that
nothing
could
save
her
she
saw
my
agony
and
did
all
she
could
to
console
me
saying
that
she
was
herself
quite
resigned
a
little
time
before
her
death
she
expressed
a
wish
that
we
should
be
united
i
was
too
happy
to
comply
with
her
request
we
were
united
i
brought
her
to
this
house
where
in
less
than
a
week
she
expired

my
arms

the
old
man
story
continued
misery
in
the
head
the
strange
marks
dealer
from
london
difficulties
of
the
chinese
language
after
another
pause
the
old
man
once
more
resumed
his
narration
if
ever
there
was
a
man
perfectly
miserable
it
was
myself
after
the
loss
of
that
cherished
woman
i
sat
solitary
in
the
house
in
which
i
had
hoped
in
her
company
to
realize
the
choicest
earthly
happiness
a
prey
to
the
bitterest
reflections
many
people
visited
and
endeavoured
to
console
me
amongst
them
was
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
who
begged
me
to
be
resigned
and
told
me
that
it
was
good
to
be
afflicted
i
bowed
my
head
but
i
could
not
help
thinking
how
easy
it
must
be
for
those
who
feel
no
affliction
to
bid
others
to
be
resigned
and
to
talk
of
the
benefit
resulting
from
sorrow
perhaps
i
should
have
paid
more
attention
to
his
discourse
than
i
did
provided
he
had
been
a
person
for
whom
it
was
possible
to
entertain
much
respect
but
his
own
heart
was
known
to
be
set
on
the
things
of
this
world
within
a
little
time
he
had
an
opportunity
in
his
own
case
of
practising
resignation
and
of
realizing
the
benefit
of
being
afflicted
a
merchant
to
whom
he
had
entrusted
all
his
fortune
in
the
hope
of
a
large
interest
became
suddenly
a
bankrupt
with
scarcely
any
assets
i
will
not
say
that
it
was
owing
to
this
misfortune
that
the
divine
died
in
less
than
a
month
after
its
occurrence
but
such
was
the
fact
amongst
those
who
most
frequently
visited
me
was
my
friend
the
surgeon
he
did
not
confine
himself
to
the
common
topics
of
consolation
but
endeavoured
to
impress
upon
me
the
necessity
of
rousing
myself
advising
me
to
occupy
my
mind
with
some
pursuit
particularly
recommending
agriculture
but
agriculture
possessed
no
interest
for
me
nor
indeed
any
pursuit
within
my
reach
my
hopes
of
happiness
had
been
blighted
and
what
cared
i
for
anything
so
at
last
he
thought
it
best
to
leave
me
to
myself
hoping
that
time
would
bring
with
it
consolation
and
i
remained
solitary
in
my
house
waited
upon
by
a
male
and
a
female
servant
oh
what
dreary
moments
i
passed
my
only
amusement
and
it
was
a
sad
one
was
to
look
at
the
things
which
once
belonged
to
my
beloved
and
which
were
now
in
my
possession
oh
how
fondly
would
i
dwell
upon
them
there
were
some
books
i
cared
not
for
books
but
these
had
belonged
to
my
beloved
oh
how
fondly
did
i
dwell
on
them
then
there
was
her
hat
and
bonnet
oh
me
how
fondly
did
i
gaze
upon
them
and
after
looking
at
her
things
for
hours
i
would
sit
and
ruminate
on
the
happiness
i
had
lost
how
i
execrated
the
moment
i
had
gone
to
the
fair
to
sell
horses
that
i
had
never
been
to
horncastle
to
sell
horses
i
would
say
might
at
this
moment
have
been
enjoying
the
company
of
my
beloved
leading
a
happy
quiet
easy
life
but
for
that
fatal
expedition
that
thought
worked
on
my
brain
till
my
brain
seemed
to
turn
round
one
day
i
sat
at
the
gazing
vacantly
around
me
my
mind
was
in
a
state
of
inexpressible
misery
there
was
a
whirl
in
my
brain
probably
like
that
which
people
feel
who
are
rapidly
going
mad
this
increased
to
such
a
degree
that
i
felt
giddiness
coming
upon
me
to
abate
this
feeling
i
no
longer
permitted
my
eyes
to
wander
about
but
fixed
them
upon
an
object
on
the
table
and
continued
gazing
at
it
for
several
minutes
without
knowing
what
it
was
at
length
the
misery
in
my
head
was
somewhat
stilled
my
lips
moved
and
i
heard
myself
saying
odd
marks
i
had
fastened
my
eyes
on
the
side
of
a
teapot
and
by
keeping
them
fixed
upon
it
had
become
aware
of
a
fact
that
had
escaped
my
notice
before
namely
that
there
were
marks
upon
it
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
upon
them
and
repeated
at
intervals
strange
marks
for
i
thought
that
looking
upon
the
marks
tended
to
abate
the
whirl
in
my
head
i
kept
tracing
the
marks
one
after
the
other
and
i
observed
that
though
they
all
bore
a
general
resemblance
to
each
other
they
were
all
to
a
certain
extent
different
the
smallest
portion
possible
of
curious
interest
had
been
awakened
within
me
and
at
last
i
asked
myself
within
my
own
mind
motive
could
induce
people
to
put
such
odd
marks
on
their
crockery
they
were
not
pictures
they
were
not
letters
what
motive
could
people
have
for
putting
them
there
at
last
i
removed
my
eyes
from
the
teapot
and
thought
for
a
few
moments
about
the
marks
presently
however
i
felt
the
whirl
returning
the
marks
became
almost
effaced
from
my
mind
and
i
was
beginning
to
revert
to
my
miserable
ruminations
when
suddenly
methought
i
heard
a
voice
say
marks
the
marks
cling
to
the
marks
or
so
i
fixed
my
eyes
again
upon
the
marks
inspecting
them
more
attentively
if
possible
than
i
had
done
before
and
at
last
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
not
capricious
or
fanciful
marks
but
were
arranged
systematically
when
i
had
gazed
at
them
for
a
considerable
time
i
turned
the
teapot
round
and
on
the
other
side
i
observed
marks
of
a
similar
kind
which
i
soon
discovered
were
identical
with
the
ones
i
had
been
observing
all
the
marks
were
something
alike
but
all
somewhat
different
and
on
comparing
them
with
each
other
i
was
struck
with
the
frequent
occurrence
of
a
mark
crossing
an
upright
line
or
projecting
from
it
now
on
the
right
now
on
the
left
side
and
i
said
to
myself
does
this
mark
sometimes
cross
the
upright
line
and
sometimes
project
and
the
more
i
thought
on
the
matter
the
less
did
i
feel
of
the
misery
in
my
head
the
things
were
at
length
removed
and
i
sat
as
i
had
for
some
time
past
been
wont
to
sit
after
my
meals
silent
and
motionless
but
in
the
present
instance
my
mind
was
not
entirely
abandoned
to
the
one
mournful
idea
which
had
so
long
distressed
it
it
was
to
a
certain
extent
occupied
with
the
marks
on
the
teapot
it
is
true
that
the
mournful
idea
strove
hard
with
the
marks
on
the
teapot
for
the
mastery
in
my
mind
and
at
last
the
painful
idea
drove
the
marks
of
the
teapot
out
they
however
would
occasionally
return
and
flit
across
my
mind
for
a
moment
or
two
and
their
coming
was
like
a
momentary
relief
from
intense
pain
i
thought
once
or
twice
that
i
would
have
the
teapot
placed
before
me
that
i
might
examine
the
marks
at
leisure
but
i
considered
that
it
would
be
as
well
to
defer
the
of
the
marks
till
the
next
morning
at
that
time
i
did
not
take
tea
of
an
evening
by
deferring
the
examination
thus
i
had
something
to
look
forward
to
on
the
next
morning
the
day
was
a
melancholy
one
but
it
certainly
was
more
tolerable
to
me
than
any
of
the
others
had
been
since
the
death
of
my
beloved
as
i
lay
awake
that
night
i
occasionally
thought
of
the
marks
and
in
my
sleep
methought
i
saw
them
upon
the
teapot
vividly
before
me
on
the
morrow
i
examined
the
marks
again
how
singular
they
looked
surely
they
must
mean
something
and
if
so
what
could
they
mean
and
at
last
i
thought
within
myself
whether
it
would
be
possible
for
me
to
make
out
what
they
meant
that
day
i
felt
more
relief
than
on
the
preceding
one
and
towards
night
i
walked
a
little
about
in
about
a
week
time
i
received
a
visit
from
my
friend
the
surgeon
after
a
little
discourse
he
told
me
that
he
perceived
i
was
better
than
when
he
had
last
seen
me
and
asked
me
what
i
had
been
about
i
told
him
that
i
had
been
principally
occupied
in
considering
certain
marks
which
i
had
found
on
a
teapot
and
wondering
what
they
could
mean
he
smiled
at
first
but
instantly
assuming
a
serious
look
he
asked
to
see
the
teapot
i
produced
it
and
after
having
surveyed
the
marks
with
attention
he
observed
that
they
were
highly
curious
and
also
wondered
what
they
meant
strongly
advise
you
said
he
attempt
to
make
them
out
and
also
to
take
moderate
exercise
and
to
see
after
your
concerns
i
followed
his
advice
every
morning
i
studied
the
marks
on
the
teapot
and
in
the
course
of
the
day
took
moderate
exercise
and
attended
to
little
domestic
matters
as
became
the
master
of
a
house
i
subsequently
learned
that
the
surgeon
in
advising
me
to
study
the
marks
and
endeavour
to
make
out
their
meaning
merely
hoped
that
by
means
of
them
my
mind
might
by
degrees
be
diverted
from
the
mournful
idea
on
which
i
had
so
long
brooded
he
was
a
man
well
skilled
in
his
profession
but
had
read
and
thought
very
little
on
matters
unconnected
with
it
he
had
no
idea
that
the
marks
had
any
particular
signification
or
were
anything
else
but
common
and
fortuitous
ones
that
i
became
at
all
acquainted
with
their
nature
was
owing
to
a
ludicrous
circumstance
which
i
will
now
relate
one
day
chancing
to
be
at
a
neighbouring
town
i
was
struck
with
the
appearance
of
a
shop
recently
established
it
had
an
immense
and
every
part
of
it
to
which
a
brush
could
be
applied
was
painted
in
a
gaudy
flaming
style
large
bowls
of
green
and
black
tea
were
placed
upon
certain
chests
which
stood
at
the
window
i
stopped
to
look
at
them
such
a
display
whatever
it
may
be
at
the
present
time
being
at
the
period
of
which
i
am
speaking
quite
uncommon
in
a
country
town
the
tea
whether
black
or
green
was
very
shining
and
inviting
and
the
bowls
of
which
there
were
three
standing
on
as
many
chests
were
very
grand
and
foreign
looking
two
of
these
were
white
with
figures
and
trees
painted
upon
them
in
blue
the
other
which
was
the
middlemost
had
neither
trees
nor
figures
upon
it
but
as
i
looked
through
the
window
appeared
to
have
on
its
sides
the
very
same
kind
of
marks
which
i
had
observed
on
the
teapot
at
home
there
were
also
marks
on
the
somewhat
similar
but
much
larger
and
apparently
not
executed
with
so
much
care
teas
direct
from
china
said
a
voice
close
to
my
side
and
looking
round
i
saw
a
youngish
man
with
a
frizzled
head
flat
face
and
an
immensely
wide
mouth
standing
in
his
by
the
door
from
china
said
he
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
walk
in
and
scent
them
do
not
want
any
tea
said
i
was
only
standing
at
the
window
examining
those
marks
on
the
bowl
and
the
chests
i
have
observed
similar
ones
on
a
teapot
at
home
walk
in
sir
said
the
young
fellow
extending
his
mouth
till
it
reached
nearly
from
ear
to
ear
walk
in
and
i
shall
be
happy
to
give
you
any
information
respecting
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
chinese
in
my
power
thereupon
i
followed
him
into
his
shop
where
he
began
to
harangue
on
the
manners
customs
and
peculiarities
of
the
chinese
especially
their
manner
of
preparing
tea
not
forgetting
to
tell
me
that
the
only
genuine
chinese
tea
ever
imported
into
england
was
to
be
found
in
his
shop
respect
to
those
marks
said
he
the
bowl
and
chests
they
are
nothing
more
nor
less
than
chinese
writing
expressing
something
though
what
i
ca
exactly
tell
you
allow
me
to
sell
you
this
pound
of
tea
he
added
showing
me
a
paper
parcel
the
envelope
there
is
a
printed
account
of
the
chinese
system
of
writing
extracted
from
authors
of
the
most
established
reputation
these
things
i
print
principally
with
the
hope
of
in
some
degree
removing
the
worse
than
gothic
ignorance
prevalent
amongst
natives
of
these
parts
i
am
from
london
myself
with
respect
to
all
that
relates
to
the
chinese
real
imperial
tea
i
assure
you
sir
that
well
to
make
short
of
what
you
doubtless
consider
a
very
tiresome
story
i
purchased
the
tea
and
carried
it
home
the
tea
proved
imperially
bad
but
the
paper
envelope
really
contained
some
information
on
the
chinese
language
and
writing
amounting
to
about
as
much
as
you
gained
from
me
the
other
day
on
learning
that
the
marks
on
the
teapot
expressed
words
i
felt
my
interest
with
respect
to
them
considerably
increased
and
returned
to
the
task
of
inspecting
them
with
greater
zeal
than
before
hoping
by
continually
looking
at
them
to
be
able
eventually
to
understand
their
meaning
in
which
hope
you
may
easily
believe
i
was
disappointed
though
my
desire
to
understand
what
they
represented
continued
on
the
increase
in
this
dilemma
i
determined
to
apply
again
to
the
shopkeeper
from
whom
i
bought
the
tea
i
found
him
in
rather
low
spirits
his
were
soiled
and
his
hair
was
out
of
curl
on
my
inquiring
how
he
got
on
he
informed
me
that
he
intended
speedily
to
leave
having
received
little
or
no
encouragement
the
people
in
their
gothic
ignorance
preferring
to
deal
with
an
shopkeeper
over
the
way
who
so
far
from
possessing
any
acquaintance
with
the
polity
and
institutions
of
the
chinese
did
not
he
believed
know
that
tea
came
from
china
are
come
for
some
more
i
suppose
said
he
on
receiving
an
answer
in
the
negative
he
looked
somewhat
blank
but
when
i
added
that
i
came
to
consult
with
him
as
to
the
means
which
i
must
take
in
order
to
acquire
the
chinese
language
he
brightened
up
must
get
a
grammar
said
he
rubbing
his
hands
you
not
one
said
i
he
replied
any
bookseller
can
procure
you
one
as
i
was
taking
my
departure
he
told
me
that
as
he
was
about
to
leave
the
neighbourhood
the
bowl
at
the
window
which
bore
the
inscription
besides
some
other
pieces
of
porcelain
of
a
similar
description
were
at
my
service
provided
i
chose
to
purchase
them
i
consented
and
two
or
three
days
afterwards
took
from
off
his
hands
all
the
china
in
his
possession
which
bore
the
inscriptions
paying
what
he
demanded
had
i
waited
till
the
sale
of
his
effects
which
occurred
within
a
few
weeks
i
could
probably
have
procured
it
for
a
fifth
part
of
the
sum
which
i
paid
the
other
pieces
realizing
very
little
i
did
not
however
grudge
the
poor
fellow
what
he
got
from
me
as
i
considered
myself
to
be
somewhat
in
his
debt
for
the
information
he
had
afforded
me
as
for
the
rest
of
my
story
it
may
be
briefly
told
i
followed
the
advice
of
the
shopkeeper
and
applied
to
a
bookseller
who
wrote
to
his
correspondent
in
london
after
a
long
interval
i
was
informed
that
if
i
wished
to
learn
chinese
i
must
do
so
through
the
medium
of
french
there
being
neither
chinese
grammar
nor
dictionary
in
our
language
i
was
at
first
very
much
disheartened
i
determined
however
at
last
to
gratify
my
desire
of
learning
chinese
even
at
the
expense
of
learning
french
i
procured
the
books
and
in
order
to
qualify
myself
to
turn
them
to
account
took
lessons
in
french
from
a
little
swiss
the
usher
of
a
neighbouring
i
was
very
stupid
in
acquiring
french
perseverance
however
enabled
me
to
acquire
a
knowledge
sufficient
for
the
object
i
had
in
view
in
about
two
years
i
began
to
study
chinese
by
myself
through
the
medium
of
the
french
well
said
i
and
how
did
you
get
on
with
the
study
of
the
chinese
and
then
the
old
man
proceeded
to
inform
me
how
he
got
on
with
the
study
of
chinese
enumerated
all
the
difficulties
he
had
had
to
encounter
dilating
upon
his
frequent
despondency
of
mind
and
occasionally
his
utter
despair
of
ever
mastering
chinese
he
told
me
that
more
than
once
he
had
determined
upon
giving
up
the
study
but
when
the
misery
in
his
head
forthwith
returned
to
escape
from
which
he
had
as
often
resumed
it
it
appeared
however
that
ten
years
elapsed
before
he
was
able
to
use
ten
of
the
two
hundred
and
fourteen
keys
which
serve
to
undo
the
locks
of
chinese
writing
and
are
you
able
at
present
to
use
the
entire
number
i
demanded
yes
said
the
old
man
i
can
at
present
use
the
whole
number
i
know
the
key
for
every
particular
lock
though
i
frequently
find
the
wards
unwilling
to
give
way
has
nothing
particular
occurred
to
you
said
i
during
the
time
that
you
have
been
prosecuting
your
studies
during
the
whole
time
in
which
i
have
been
engaged
in
these
studies
said
the
old
man
only
one
circumstance
has
occurred
which
requires
any
particular
mention
the
death
of
my
old
friend
the
surgeon
who
was
carried
off
suddenly
by
a
fit
of
apoplexy
his
death
was
a
great
shock
to
me
and
for
a
time
interrupted
my
studies
his
son
however
who
succeeded
him
was
very
kind
to
me
and
in
some
degree
supplied
his
father
place
and
i
gradually
returned
to
my
chinese
locks
and
keys
and
in
applying
keys
to
the
chinese
locks
you
employ
your
time
yes
said
the
old
man
in
making
out
the
inscriptions
on
the
various
pieces
of
porcelain
which
i
have
at
different
times
procured
i
pass
my
time
the
first
inscription
which
i
translated
was
that
on
the
teapot
of
my
beloved
and
how
many
other
pieces
of
porcelain
may
you
have
at
present
in
your
possession
about
fifteen
hundred
and
how
did
you
obtain
them
i
demanded
without
much
labour
said
the
old
man
in
the
neighbouring
towns
and
villages
chiefly
at
auctions
of
which
about
twenty
years
ago
there
were
many
in
these
parts
and
may
i
ask
your
reasons
for
confining
your
studies
entirely
to
the
crockery
literature
of
china
when
you
have
all
the
rest
at
your
disposal
the
inscriptions
enable
me
to
pass
my
time
said
the
old
man
what
more
would
the
whole
literature
of
china
do
and
from
these
inscriptions
said
i
what
a
book
it
is
in
your
power
to
make
whenever
so
disposed
from
the
crockery
literature
of
china
such
a
book
would
be
sure
to
take
even
glorious
john
himself
would
not
disdain
to
publish
it
the
old
man
smiled
i
have
no
desire
for
literary
distinction
said
he
no
ambition
my
original
wish
was
to
pass
my
life
in
easy
quiet
obscurity
with
her
whom
i
loved
i
was
disappointed
in
my
wish
she
was
removed
who
constituted
my
only
felicity
in
this
life
desolation
came
to
my
heart
and
misery
to
my
head
to
escape
from
the
latter
i
had
recourse
to
chinese
by
degrees
the
misery
left
my
head
but
the
desolation
of
the
heart
yet
remains
be
of
good
cheer
said
i
through
the
instrumentality
of
this
affliction
you
have
learnt
chinese
and
in
so
doing
learnt
to
practise
the
duties
of
hospitality
who
but
a
man
who
could
read
runes
on
a
teapot
would
have
received
an
unfortunate
wayfarer
as
you
have
received
me
well
said
the
old
man
let
us
hope
that
all
is
for
the
best
i
am
by
nature
indolent
and
but
for
this
affliction
should
perhaps
have
hardly
taken
the
trouble
to
do
my
duty
to
my
i
am
very
very
indolent
said
he
slightly
glancing
towards
the
clock
therefore
let
us
hope
that
all
is
for
the
best
but
oh
these
trials
they
are
very
hard
to
bear

the
spirit
of
the
hearth
what
the
next
morning
having
breakfasted
with
my
old
friend
i
went
into
the
stable
to
make
the
necessary
preparations
for
my
departure
there
with
the
assistance
of
a
stable
lad
i
cleaned
and
caparisoned
my
horse
and
then
returning
into
the
house
i
made
the
old
female
attendant
such
a
present
as
i
deemed
would
be
some
compensation
for
the
trouble
i
had
caused
hearing
that
the
old
gentleman
was
in
his
study
i
repaired
to
him
i
am
come
to
take
leave
of
you
said
i
and
to
thank
you
for
all
the
hospitality
which
i
have
received
at
your
hands
the
eyes
of
the
old
man
were
fixed
steadfastly
on
the
inscription
which
i
had
found
him
studying
on
a
former
occasion
at
length
he
murmured
to
himself
i
have
it
i
think
i
have
it
and
then
looking
at
me
he
said
so
you
are
about
to
depart
yes
said
i
my
horse
will
be
at
the
front
door
in
a
few
minutes
i
am
glad
however
before
i
go
to
find
that
you
have
mastered
the
inscription
yes
said
the
old
man
i
believe
i
have
mastered
it
it
seems
to
consist
of
some
verses
relating
to
the
worship
of
the
spirit
of
the
hearth
what
is
the
spirit
of
the
hearth
said
i
one
of
the
many
demons
which
the
chinese
worship
said
the
old
man
they
do
not
worship
one
god
but
many
and
then
the
old
man
told
me
a
great
many
particulars
respecting
the
demon
worship
of
the
chinese
after
the
lapse
of
at
least
half
an
hour
i
said
i
must
not
linger
here
any
longer
however
willing
horncastle
is
distant
and
i
wish
to
be
there
pray
can
you
inform
me
what
the
old
man
rising
looked
towards
the
clock
which
hung
on
the
side
of
the
room
at
his
left
hand
on
the
farther
side
of
the
table
at
which
he
was
seated
i
am
rather
said
i
and
can
not
distinguish
the
number
at
that
distance
it
is
ten
said
the
old
man
i
believe
somewhat
past
a
quarter
perhaps
yes
said
the
old
man
a
quarter
or
or
seven
minutes
or
ten
minutes
past
ten
i
do
not
understand
you
why
to
tell
you
the
truth
said
the
old
man
with
a
smile
there
is
one
thing
to
the
knowledge
of
which
i
could
never
exactly
attain
do
you
mean
to
say
said
i
that
you
do
not
know
what
i
can
give
a
guess
said
the
old
man
to
within
a
few
minutes
but
you
can
not
tell
the
exact
moment
no
said
the
old
man
in
the
name
of
wonder
said
i
with
that
thing
there
on
the
wall
continually
ticking
in
your
ear
how
comes
it
that
you
do
not
know
why
said
the
old
man
i
have
contented
myself
with
giving
a
tolerably
good
guess
to
do
more
would
have
been
too
great
trouble
but
you
have
learnt
chinese
said
i
yes
said
the
old
man
i
have
learnt
chinese
well
said
i
i
really
would
counsel
you
to
learn
to
know
as
soon
as
possible
consider
what
a
sad
thing
it
would
be
to
go
out
of
the
world
not
knowing
what
a
millionth
part
of
the
trouble
required
to
learn
chinese
would
if
employed
infallibly
teach
you
to
know
what
i
had
a
motive
for
learning
chinese
said
the
old
man
the
hope
of
appeasing
the
misery
in
my
head
with
respect
to
not
knowing
i
can
not
see
anything
particularly
sad
in
the
matter
a
man
may
get
through
the
world
very
creditably
without
knowing
what
yet
upon
the
whole
it
is
no
bad
thing
to
know
what
you
of
course
do
it
would
be
too
good
a
joke
if
two
people
were
to
be
together
one
knowing
armenian
and
the
other
chinese
and
neither
knowing
what
i
now
see
you
off
chapter
xxxvi
arrival
at
horncastle
the
inn
and
ostlers
the
garret
figure
of
a
man
with
a
candle
leaving
the
house
of
the
old
man
who
knew
chinese
but
could
not
tell
what
was
i
wended
my
way
to
horncastle
which
i
reached
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
without
having
met
any
adventure
on
the
way
worthy
of
being
marked
down
in
this
very
remarkable
history
the
town
was
a
small
one
seemingly
ancient
and
was
crowded
with
people
and
horses
i
proceeded
without
delay
to
the
inn
to
which
my
friend
the
surgeon
had
directed
me
it
is
of
no
use
coming
here
said
two
or
three
ostlers
as
i
entered
the
yard
all
full
no
room
whatever
whilst
one
added
in
an
undertone
that
ere
a
horse
i
want
to
see
the
master
of
this
inn
said
i
as
i
dismounted
from
the
horse
see
the
master
said
an
ostler
the
same
who
had
paid
the
negative
kind
of
compliment
to
the
horse
a
likely
thing
truly
my
master
is
drinking
wine
with
some
of
the
grand
gentry
and
ca
be
disturbed
for
the
sake
of
the
like
of
you
i
bring
a
letter
to
him
said
i
pulling
out
the
surgeon
epistle
i
wish
you
would
deliver
it
to
him
i
added
offering
a
oh
it
you
is
it
said
the
ostler
taking
the
letter
and
the
my
master
will
be
right
glad
to
see
you
why
you
been
here
for
many
a
year
i
carry
the
note
to
him
at
once
and
with
these
words
he
hurried
into
the
house
that
a
nice
horse
young
man
said
another
ostler
what
will
you
take
for
it
to
which
interrogation
i
made
no
answer
if
you
wish
to
sell
him
said
the
ostler
coming
up
to
me
and
winking
knowingly
i
think
i
and
my
partners
might
offer
you
a
summut
under
seventy
pounds
to
which
kind
and
offer
i
made
no
reply
save
by
winking
in
the
same
kind
of
knowing
manner
in
which
i
observed
him
wink
rather
leary
said
a
third
ostler
well
young
man
perhaps
you
will
drink
night
with
me
and
my
partners
when
we
can
talk
the
matter
over
before
i
had
time
to
answer
the
landlord
a
man
made
his
appearance
with
the
ostler
he
bore
the
letter
in
his
hand
without
glancing
at
me
he
betook
himself
at
once
to
consider
the
horse
going
round
him
and
observing
every
point
with
the
utmost
minuteness
at
last
having
gone
round
the
horse
three
times
he
stopped
beside
me
and
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
horse
bent
his
head
towards
his
right
shoulder
that
horse
is
worth
some
money
said
he
turning
towards
me
suddenly
and
slightly
touching
me
on
the
arm
with
the
letter
which
he
held
in
his
hand
to
which
observation
i
made
no
reply
save
by
bending
my
head
towards
the
right
shoulder
as
i
had
seen
him
do
the
young
man
is
going
to
talk
to
me
and
my
partners
about
it
said
the
ostler
who
had
expressed
an
opinion
that
he
and
his
friends
might
offer
me
somewhat
under
seventy
pounds
for
the
animal
pooh
said
the
landlord
the
young
man
knows
what
he
is
about
in
the
meantime
lead
the
horse
to
the
reserved
stall
and
see
well
after
him
my
friend
said
he
taking
me
aside
after
the
ostler
had
led
the
animal
away
recommends
you
to
me
in
the
strongest
manner
on
which
account
alone
i
take
you
and
your
horse
in
i
need
not
advise
you
not
to
be
taken
in
as
i
should
say
by
your
look
that
you
are
tolerably
awake
but
there
are
queer
hands
at
horncastle
at
this
time
and
those
fellows
of
mine
you
understand
me
but
i
have
a
great
deal
to
do
at
present
so
you
must
excuse
me
and
thereupon
went
into
the
house
that
same
evening
i
was
engaged
at
least
two
hours
in
the
stable
in
rubbing
the
horse
down
and
preparing
him
for
the
exhibition
which
i
intended
he
should
make
in
the
fair
on
the
following
day
the
ostler
to
whom
i
had
given
the
occasionally
assisted
me
though
he
was
too
much
occupied
by
the
horses
of
other
guests
to
devote
any
length
of
time
to
the
service
of
mine
he
more
than
once
repeated
to
me
his
firm
conviction
that
himself
and
partners
could
afford
to
offer
me
summut
for
the
horse
and
at
a
later
hour
when
in
compliance
with
his
invitation
i
took
a
glass
of
summut
with
himself
and
partners
in
a
little
room
surrounded
with
on
which
we
sat
both
himself
and
partners
endeavoured
to
impress
upon
me
chiefly
by
means
of
nods
and
winks
their
conviction
that
they
could
afford
to
give
me
summut
for
the
horse
provided
i
were
disposed
to
sell
him
in
return
for
which
intimation
with
as
many
nods
and
winks
as
they
had
all
collectively
used
i
endeavoured
to
impress
upon
them
my
conviction
that
i
could
get
summut
handsomer
in
the
fair
than
they
might
be
disposed
to
offer
me
seeing
as
how
which
how
i
followed
by
a
wink
and
a
nod
which
they
seemed
perfectly
to
understand
one
or
two
of
them
declaring
that
if
the
case
was
so
it
made
a
great
deal
of
difference
and
that
they
did
not
wish
to
be
any
hindrance
to
me
more
particularly
as
it
was
quite
clear
i
had
been
an
ostler
like
themselves
it
was
late
at
night
when
i
began
to
think
of
retiring
to
rest
on
inquiring
if
there
was
any
place
in
which
i
could
sleep
i
was
informed
that
there
was
a
bed
at
my
service
provided
i
chose
to
sleep
in
a
bedded
room
one
of
the
beds
of
which
was
engaged
by
another
gentleman
i
expressed
my
satisfaction
at
this
arrangement
and
was
conducted
by
a
up
many
pairs
of
stairs
to
a
garret
in
which
were
two
small
beds
in
one
of
which
she
gave
me
to
understand
another
gentleman
slept
he
had
however
not
yet
retired
to
rest
i
asked
who
he
was
but
the
could
give
me
no
information
about
him
save
that
he
was
a
highly
respectable
gentleman
and
a
friend
of
her
master
presently
bidding
me
good
night
she
left
me
with
a
candle
and
i
having
undressed
myself
and
extinguished
the
light
went
to
bed
notwithstanding
the
noises
which
sounded
from
every
part
of
the
house
i
was
not
slow
in
falling
asleep
being
thoroughly
tired
i
know
not
how
long
i
might
have
been
in
bed
perhaps
two
hours
when
i
was
partially
awakened
by
a
light
shining
upon
my
face
whereupon
unclosing
my
eyes
i
perceived
the
figure
of
a
man
with
a
candle
in
one
hand
staring
at
my
face
whilst
with
the
other
hand
he
held
back
the
curtain
of
the
bed
as
i
have
said
before
i
was
only
partially
awakened
my
power
of
conception
was
consequently
very
confused
it
appeared
to
me
however
that
the
man
was
dressed
in
a
green
coat
that
he
had
curly
brown
or
black
hair
and
that
there
was
something
peculiar
in
his
look
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
recollect
myself
the
curtain
dropped
and
i
heard
or
thought
i
heard
a
voice
say
do
know
the
cove
then
there
was
a
rustling
like
a
person
undressing
whereupon
being
satisfied
that
it
was
my
i
dropped
asleep
but
was
awakened
again
by
a
kind
of
heavy
plunge
upon
the
other
bed
which
caused
it
to
rock
and
creak
when
i
observed
that
the
light
had
been
extinguished
probably
blown
out
if
i
might
judge
from
a
rather
disagreeable
smell
of
burnt
wick
which
remained
in
the
room
and
which
kept
me
awake
till
i
heard
my
companion
breathing
hard
when
turning
on
the
other
side
i
was
again
once
more
speedily
in
the
arms
of
slumber
chapter
xxxvii
horncastle
fair
it
had
been
my
intention
to
be
up
and
doing
early
on
the
following
morning
but
my
slumbers
proved
so
profound
that
i
did
not
wake
until
about
eight
on
arising
i
again
found
myself
the
sole
occupant
of
the
apartment
my
more
alert
companion
having
probably
risen
at
a
much
earlier
hour
having
dressed
myself
i
descended
and
going
to
the
stable
found
my
horse
under
the
hands
of
my
friend
the
ostler
who
was
carefully
rubbing
him
down
there
a
better
horse
in
the
fair
said
he
to
me
and
as
you
are
one
of
us
and
appear
to
be
all
right
i
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
do
take
less
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
for
him
if
you
mind
your
hits
you
may
get
it
for
i
have
known
two
hundred
given
in
this
fair
for
one
no
better
if
so
good
well
said
i
thank
you
for
your
advice
which
i
will
take
and
if
successful
will
give
you
handsome
thank
you
said
the
ostler
and
now
let
me
ask
whether
you
are
up
to
all
the
ways
of
this
here
place
i
have
never
been
here
before
said
i
but
i
have
a
pair
of
tolerably
sharp
eyes
in
my
head
that
i
see
you
have
said
the
ostler
but
many
a
body
with
as
sharp
a
pair
of
eyes
as
yourn
has
lost
his
horse
in
this
fair
for
want
of
having
been
here
before
therefore
said
he
i
give
you
a
caution
or
two
thereupon
the
ostler
proceeded
to
give
me
at
least
half
a
dozen
cautions
only
two
of
which
i
shall
relate
to
the
reader
the
first
not
to
stop
to
listen
to
what
any
chance
customer
might
have
to
say
and
the
last
the
one
on
which
he
appeared
to
lay
most
stress
by
no
manner
of
means
to
permit
a
yorkshireman
to
get
up
into
the
saddle
for
said
he
if
you
do
it
is
three
to
one
that
he
rides
off
with
the
horse
he
ca
help
it
trust
a
cat
amongst
cream
but
never
trust
a
yorkshireman
on
the
saddle
of
a
good
horse
he
continued
that
saddle
of
yours
is
not
a
particularly
good
one
no
more
is
the
bridle
i
tell
you
what
as
you
seem
a
decent
kind
of
a
young
chap
i
lend
you
a
saddle
and
bridle
of
my
master
almost
bran
new
he
wo
object
i
know
as
you
are
a
friend
of
his
only
you
must
not
forget
your
promise
to
come
down
with
summut
handsome
after
you
have
sold
the
animal
after
a
slight
breakfast
i
mounted
the
horse
which
decked
out
in
his
borrowed
finery
really
looked
better
by
a
large
sum
of
money
than
on
any
former
occasion
making
my
way
out
of
the
yard
of
the
inn
i
was
instantly
in
the
principal
street
of
the
town
up
and
down
which
an
immense
number
of
horses
were
being
exhibited
some
led
and
others
with
riders
a
wonderful
small
quantity
of
good
horses
in
the
fair
this
time
i
heard
a
stout
individual
say
who
was
staring
up
the
street
with
his
side
towards
me
halloo
young
fellow
said
he
a
few
moments
after
i
had
passed
whose
horse
is
that
stop
i
want
to
look
at
him
though
confident
that
he
was
addressing
himself
to
me
i
took
no
notice
remembering
the
advice
of
the
ostler
and
proceeded
up
the
street
my
horse
possessed
a
good
walking
step
but
walking
as
the
reader
knows
was
not
his
best
pace
which
was
the
long
trot
at
which
i
could
not
well
exercise
him
in
the
street
on
account
of
the
crowd
of
men
and
animals
however
as
he
walked
along
i
could
easily
perceive
that
he
attracted
no
slight
attention
amongst
those
who
by
their
jockey
dress
and
general
appearance
i
imagined
to
be
connoisseurs
i
heard
various
calls
to
stop
to
none
of
which
i
paid
the
slightest
attention
in
a
few
minutes
i
found
myself
out
of
the
town
when
turning
round
for
the
purpose
of
returning
i
found
i
had
been
followed
by
several
of
the
individuals
whom
i
had
observed
in
the
fair
now
would
be
the
time
for
a
display
thought
i
and
looking
around
me
i
observed
two
gates
one
on
each
side
of
the
road
and
fronting
each
other
turning
my
horse
head
to
one
i
pressed
my
heels
to
his
sides
loosened
the
reins
and
gave
an
encouraging
cry
whereupon
the
animal
cleared
the
gate
in
a
twinkling
before
he
had
advanced
ten
yards
in
the
field
to
which
the
gate
opened
i
had
turned
him
round
and
again
giving
him
cry
and
rein
i
caused
him
to
leap
back
again
into
the
road
and
still
allowing
him
head
i
made
him
leap
the
other
gate
and
forthwith
turning
him
round
i
caused
him
to
leap
once
more
into
the
road
where
he
stood
proudly
tossing
his
head
as
much
as
to
say
what
more
a
fine
horse
a
capital
horse
said
several
of
the
connoisseurs
what
do
you
ask
for
him
too
much
for
any
of
you
to
pay
said
i
a
horse
like
this
is
intended
for
other
kind
of
customers
than
any
of
you
how
do
you
know
that
said
one
the
very
same
person
whom
i
had
heard
complaining
in
the
street
of
the
paucity
of
good
horses
in
the
fair
come
let
us
know
what
you
ask
for
him
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
said
i
neither
more
nor
less
do
you
call
that
a
great
price
said
the
man
why
i
thought
you
would
have
asked
double
that
amount
you
do
yourself
injustice
young
man
perhaps
i
do
said
i
but
that
my
affair
i
do
not
choose
to
take
more
i
wish
you
would
let
me
get
into
the
saddle
said
the
man
the
horse
knows
you
and
therefore
shows
to
more
advantage
but
i
should
like
to
see
how
he
would
move
under
me
who
am
a
stranger
will
you
let
me
get
into
the
saddle
young
man
no
said
i
i
will
not
let
you
get
into
the
saddle
why
not
said
the
man
lest
you
should
be
a
yorkshireman
said
i
and
should
run
away
with
the
horse
yorkshire
said
the
man
i
am
from
suffolk
silly
suffolk
so
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
my
running
away
with
the
horse
oh
if
that
the
case
said
i
i
should
be
afraid
that
the
horse
would
run
away
with
you
so
i
will
by
no
means
let
you
mount
will
you
let
me
look
in
his
mouth
said
the
man
if
you
please
said
i
but
i
tell
you
he
apt
to
bite
he
can
scarcely
be
a
worse
bite
than
his
master
said
the
man
looking
into
the
horse
mouth
he
four
off
i
say
young
man
will
you
warrant
this
horse
no
said
i
i
never
warrant
horses
the
horses
that
i
ride
can
always
warrant
themselves
i
wish
you
would
let
me
speak
a
word
to
you
said
he
just
come
aside
it
a
nice
horse
said
he
in
a
half
whisper
after
i
had
ridden
a
few
paces
aside
with
him
it
a
nice
horse
said
he
placing
his
hand
upon
the
pommel
of
the
saddle
and
looking
up
in
my
face
and
i
think
i
can
find
you
a
customer
if
you
would
take
a
hundred
i
think
my
lord
would
purchase
it
for
he
has
sent
me
about
the
fair
to
look
him
up
a
horse
by
which
he
could
hope
to
make
an
honest
penny
well
said
i
and
could
he
not
make
an
honest
penny
and
yet
give
me
the
price
i
ask
why
said
the
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
is
as
much
as
the
animal
is
worth
or
nearly
so
and
my
lord
do
you
see
i
see
no
reason
at
all
said
i
why
i
should
sell
the
animal
for
less
than
he
is
worth
in
order
that
his
lordship
may
be
benefited
by
him
so
that
if
his
lordship
wants
to
make
an
honest
penny
he
must
find
some
person
who
would
consider
the
disadvantage
of
selling
him
a
horse
for
less
than
it
is
worth
as
counterbalanced
by
the
honour
of
dealing
with
a
lord
which
i
should
never
do
but
i
ca
be
wasting
my
time
here
i
am
going
back
to
the
where
if
you
or
any
person
are
desirous
of
purchasing
the
horse
you
must
come
within
the
next
half
hour
or
i
shall
probably
not
feel
disposed
to
sell
him
at
all
another
word
young
man
said
the
jockey
but
without
staying
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
i
put
the
horse
to
his
best
trot
and
the
town
and
threading
my
way
as
well
as
i
could
through
the
press
i
returned
to
the
yard
of
the
inn
where
dismounting
i
stood
still
holding
the
horse
by
the
bridle
i
had
been
standing
in
this
manner
about
five
minutes
when
i
saw
the
jockey
enter
the
yard
accompanied
by
another
individual
they
advanced
directly
towards
me
here
is
my
lord
come
to
look
at
the
horse
young
man
said
the
jockey
my
lord
as
the
jockey
called
him
was
a
tall
figure
of
about
he
had
on
his
head
a
hat
somewhat
rusty
and
on
his
back
a
surtout
of
blue
rather
the
worse
for
wear
his
forehead
if
not
high
was
exceedingly
narrow
his
eyes
were
brown
with
a
glare
in
them
the
nose
was
rather
long
and
the
mouth
very
wide
the
high
and
the
cheeks
as
to
hue
and
consistency
exhibiting
very
much
the
appearance
of
a
withered
red
apple
there
was
a
gaunt
expression
of
hunger
in
the
whole
countenance
he
had
scarcely
glanced
at
the
horse
when
drawing
in
his
cheeks
he
thrust
out
his
lips
very
much
after
the
manner
of
a
baboon
when
he
sees
a
piece
of
sugar
held
out
towards
him
is
this
horse
yours
said
he
suddenly
turning
towards
me
with
a
kind
of
smirk
it
my
horse
said
i
are
you
the
person
who
wishes
to
make
an
honest
penny
by
it
how
said
he
drawing
up
his
head
with
a
very
consequential
look
and
speaking
with
a
very
haughty
tone
what
do
you
mean
we
looked
at
each
other
full
in
the
face
after
a
few
moments
the
muscles
of
the
mouth
of
him
of
the
hungry
look
began
to
move
violently
the
face
was
puckered
into
innumerable
wrinkles
and
the
eyes
became
half
closed
well
said
i
have
you
ever
seen
me
before
i
suppose
you
are
asking
yourself
that
question
excuse
me
sir
said
he
dropping
his
lofty
look
and
speaking
in
a
very
subdued
and
civil
tone
i
have
never
had
the
honour
of
seeing
you
before
that
is
said
he
slightly
glancing
at
me
again
and
again
moving
the
muscles
of
his
mouth
no
i
have
never
seen
you
before
he
added
making
me
a
bow
i
have
never
had
that
pleasure
my
business
with
you
at
present
is
to
inquire
the
lowest
price
you
are
willing
to
take
for
this
horse
my
agent
here
informs
me
that
you
ask
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
which
i
can
not
think
of
giving
the
horse
is
a
showy
horse
but
look
my
dear
sir
he
has
a
defect
here
and
there
in
his
near
fore
leg
i
observe
something
which
looks
very
like
a
splint
yes
upon
my
credit
said
he
touching
the
animal
he
has
a
splint
or
something
which
will
end
in
one
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
sir
what
could
have
induced
you
ever
to
ask
anything
like
that
for
this
animal
i
protest
that
in
my
time
i
have
frequently
bought
a
better
for
who
are
you
sir
i
am
in
treaty
for
this
horse
said
he
to
a
man
who
had
come
up
whilst
he
was
talking
and
was
now
looking
into
the
horse
mouth
who
am
i
said
the
man
still
looking
into
the
mouth
who
am
i
his
lordship
asks
me
ah
i
see
close
on
five
said
he
releasing
the
horse
jaws
and
looking
at
me
this
new
comer
was
a
thin
individual
with
wiry
curling
brown
hair
his
face
was
dark
and
wore
an
arch
and
somewhat
roguish
expression
upon
one
of
his
eyes
was
a
kind
of
speck
or
beam
he
might
be
about
forty
wore
a
green
jockey
coat
and
held
in
his
hand
a
black
riding
whip
with
a
knob
of
silver
wire
as
i
gazed
upon
his
countenance
it
brought
powerfully
to
my
mind
the
face
which
by
the
light
of
the
candle
i
had
seen
staring
over
me
on
the
preceding
night
when
lying
in
bed
and
half
asleep
close
beside
him
and
seemingly
in
his
company
stood
an
exceedingly
tall
figure
that
of
a
youth
seemingly
about
dressed
in
a
handsome
riding
dress
and
wearing
on
his
head
a
singular
hat
green
in
colour
and
with
a
very
high
peak
what
do
you
ask
for
this
horse
said
he
of
the
green
coat
winking
at
me
with
the
eye
which
had
a
beam
in
it
whilst
the
other
shone
and
sparkled
like
mrs
colonel
golconda
diamond
who
are
you
sir
i
demand
once
more
said
he
of
the
hungry
look
who
am
i
why
who
should
i
be
but
jack
dale
who
buys
horses
for
himself
and
other
folk
i
want
one
at
present
for
this
short
young
gentleman
said
he
motioning
with
his
finger
to
the
gigantic
youth
well
sir
said
the
other
and
what
business
have
you
to
interfere
between
me
and
any
purchase
i
may
be
disposed
to
make
well
then
said
the
other
be
quick
and
purchase
the
horse
or
perhaps
i
may
do
you
think
i
am
to
be
dictated
to
by
a
fellow
of
your
description
said
his
lordship
begone
or
what
do
you
ask
for
this
horse
said
the
other
to
me
very
coolly
a
hundred
and
fifty
said
i
i
should
mind
giving
it
to
you
said
he
you
will
do
no
such
thing
said
his
lordship
speaking
so
fast
that
he
almost
stuttered
sir
said
he
to
me
i
must
give
you
what
you
ask
symmonds
take
possession
of
the
animal
for
me
said
he
to
the
other
jockey
who
attended
him
you
will
please
to
do
no
such
thing
without
my
consent
said
i
i
have
not
sold
him
i
have
this
moment
told
you
that
i
will
give
you
the
price
you
demand
said
his
lordship
is
not
that
sufficient
no
said
i
there
is
a
proper
manner
of
doing
everything
had
you
come
forward
in
a
manly
and
gentlemanly
manner
to
purchase
the
horse
i
should
have
been
happy
to
sell
him
to
you
but
after
all
the
fault
you
have
found
with
him
i
would
not
sell
him
to
you
at
any
price
so
send
your
friend
to
find
up
another
you
behave
in
this
manner
i
suppose
said
his
lordship
because
this
fellow
has
expressed
a
willingness
to
come
to
your
terms
i
would
advise
you
to
be
cautious
how
you
trust
the
animal
in
his
hands
i
think
i
have
seen
him
before
and
could
tell
you
what
can
you
tell
of
me
said
the
other
going
up
to
him
except
that
i
have
been
a
poor
and
that
now
i
am
a
dealer
in
horses
and
that
my
father
was
lagged
that
all
you
could
tell
of
me
and
that
i
do
mind
telling
myself
but
there
are
two
things
they
ca
say
of
me
they
say
that
i
am
either
a
coward
or
a
screw
either
except
so
far
as
one
who
gets
his
bread
by
horses
may
be
expected
to
be
and
they
ca
say
of
me
that
i
ever
ate
up
an
ice
which
a
young
woman
was
waiting
for
or
that
i
ever
backed
out
of
a
fight
horse
said
he
motioning
with
his
finger
tauntingly
to
the
other
what
do
you
want
with
a
horse
except
to
take
the
bread
out
of
the
mouth
of
a
poor
man
is
not
the
battle
of
waterloo
so
that
you
do
want
to
back
out
of
danger
by
pretending
to
have
hurt
yourself
by
falling
from
the
creature
back
my
lord
of
the
white
feather
come
none
of
your
fierce
looks
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
in
fact
the
other
had
assumed
an
expression
of
the
deadliest
malice
his
teeth
were
clenched
his
lips
quivered
and
were
quite
pale
the
eyes
sparkled
and
he
made
a
half
spring
a
la
rat
towards
his
adversary
who
only
laughed
restraining
himself
however
he
suddenly
turned
to
his
understrapper
saying
symmonds
will
you
see
me
thus
insulted
go
and
trounce
this
scoundrel
you
can
i
know
symmonds
trounce
me
said
the
other
going
up
to
the
person
addressed
and
drawing
his
hand
contemptuously
over
his
face
why
i
beat
symmonds
in
this
very
yard
in
one
round
three
years
ago
did
i
symmonds
said
he
to
the
understrapper
who
held
down
his
head
muttering
in
a
surly
tone
i
did
come
here
to
fight
let
every
one
take
his
own
part
right
symmonds
said
the
other
especially
every
one
from
whom
there
is
nothing
to
be
got
i
would
give
you
for
all
the
trouble
you
have
had
provided
i
were
not
afraid
that
my
lord
plume
there
would
get
it
from
you
as
soon
as
you
leave
the
yard
together
come
take
yourselves
both
off
there
nothing
to
be
made
here
indeed
his
lordship
seemed
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
for
after
a
further
glance
at
the
horse
a
contemptuous
look
at
me
and
a
scowl
at
the
jockey
he
turned
on
his
heel
muttering
something
which
sounded
like
fellows
and
stalked
out
of
the
yard
followed
by
symmonds
and
now
young
man
said
the
jockey
or
whatever
he
was
turning
to
me
with
an
arch
leer
i
suppose
i
may
consider
myself
as
the
purchaser
of
this
here
animal
for
the
use
and
behoof
of
this
young
gentleman
making
a
sign
with
his
head
to
the
tall
young
man
by
his
side
by
no
means
said
i
i
am
utterly
unacquainted
with
either
of
you
and
before
parting
with
the
horse
i
must
be
satisfied
as
to
the
respectability
of
the
purchaser
oh
as
to
that
matter
said
he
i
have
plenty
of
vouchers
for
my
respectability
about
me
and
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
bosom
below
his
waistcoat
he
drew
out
a
large
bundle
of
notes
these
are
the
kind
of
things
said
he
which
vouch
best
for
a
man
respectability
not
always
said
i
indeed
sometimes
these
kind
of
things
need
vouchers
for
themselves
the
man
looked
at
me
with
a
peculiar
look
do
you
mean
to
say
that
these
notes
are
not
sufficient
notes
said
he
because
if
you
do
i
shall
take
the
liberty
of
thinking
you
are
not
over
civil
and
when
i
thinks
a
person
is
not
over
and
above
civil
i
sometimes
takes
off
my
coat
and
when
my
coat
is
off
you
sometimes
knock
people
down
i
added
well
whether
you
knock
me
down
or
not
i
beg
leave
to
tell
you
that
i
am
a
stranger
in
this
fair
and
that
i
shall
part
with
the
horse
to
nobody
who
has
no
better
guarantee
for
his
respectability
than
a
roll
of
which
may
be
good
or
not
for
what
i
know
who
am
not
a
judge
of
such
things
oh
if
you
are
a
stranger
here
said
the
man
as
i
believe
you
are
never
having
seen
you
here
before
except
last
night
when
i
think
i
saw
you
above
stairs
by
the
glimmer
of
a
candle
i
say
if
you
are
a
stranger
you
are
quite
right
to
be
cautious
queer
things
being
done
in
this
fair
as
nobody
knows
better
than
myself
he
added
with
a
leer
but
i
suppose
if
the
landlord
of
the
house
vouches
for
me
and
my
notes
you
will
have
no
objection
to
part
with
the
horse
to
me
none
whatever
said
i
and
in
the
meantime
the
horse
can
return
to
the
stable
thereupon
i
delivered
the
horse
to
my
friend
the
ostler
the
landlord
of
the
house
on
being
questioned
by
me
as
to
the
character
and
condition
of
my
new
acquaintance
informed
me
that
he
was
a
respectable
horsedealer
and
an
intimate
friend
of
his
whereupon
the
purchase
was
soon
brought
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
chapter

high
dutch
it
was
evening
and
myself
and
the
two
acquaintances
i
had
made
in
the
fair
namely
the
jockey
and
the
tall
foreigner
sat
in
a
large
upstairs
room
which
looked
into
a
court
we
had
dined
with
several
people
connected
with
the
fair
at
a
long
they
had
now
departed
and
we
sat
at
a
small
with
wine
and
a
candle
before
us
both
my
companions
had
pipes
in
their
mouths
the
jockey
a
common
pipe
and
the
foreigner
one
the
syphon
of
which
made
of
some
kind
of
wood
was
at
least
six
feet
long
and
the
bowl
of
which
made
of
a
white
kind
of
substance
like
porcelain
and
capable
of
holding
nearly
an
ounce
of
tobacco
rested
on
the
ground
the
jockey
frequently
emptied
and
replenished
his
glass
the
foreigner
sometimes
raised
his
to
his
lips
for
no
other
purpose
seemingly
than
to
moisten
them
as
he
never
drained
his
glass
as
for
myself
though
i
did
not
smoke
i
had
a
glass
before
me
from
which
i
sometimes
took
a
sip
the
room
notwithstanding
the
window
was
flung
open
was
in
general
so
filled
with
smoke
chiefly
that
which
was
drawn
from
the
huge
bowl
of
the
foreigner
that
my
companions
and
i
were
frequently
concealed
from
each
other
eyes
the
conversation
which
related
entirely
to
the
events
of
the
fair
was
carried
on
by
the
jockey
and
myself
the
foreigner
who
appeared
to
understand
the
greater
part
of
what
we
said
occasionally
putting
in
a
few
observations
in
broken
english
at
length
the
jockey
after
the
other
had
made
some
ineffectual
attempts
to
express
something
intelligibly
which
he
wished
to
say
observed
is
it
a
pity
that
so
fine
a
fellow
as
meinheer
and
so
clever
a
fellow
too
as
i
believe
him
to
be
is
not
a
better
master
of
our
language
is
the
gentleman
a
german
said
i
if
so
i
can
interpret
for
him
anything
he
wishes
to
say
the
deuce
you
can
said
the
jockey
taking
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
staring
at
me
through
the
smoke
ha
you
speak
german
vociferated
the
foreigner
in
that
language
by
isten
i
am
glad
of
it
i
wanted
to
say
and
here
he
said
in
german
what
he
wished
to
say
and
which
was
of
no
great
importance
and
which
i
translated
into
english
well
if
you
do
put
me
out
said
the
jockey
what
language
is
that
dutch
high
dutch
said
i
high
dutch
and
you
speak
high
dutch
why
i
had
booked
you
for
as
great
an
ignoramus
as
myself
who
ca
write
no
nor
distinguish
in
a
book
a
great
a
from
a
bull
foot
a
person
may
be
a
very
clever
man
said
i
no
not
a
clever
man
for
clever
signifies
clerkly
and
a
clever
man
one
who
is
able
to
read
and
write
and
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
his
clergy
or
clerkship
but
a
person
may
be
a
very
acute
person
without
being
able
to
read
or
write
i
never
saw
a
more
acute
countenance
than
your
own
no
soft
soap
said
the
jockey
for
i
never
uses
any
however
thank
you
for
your
information
i
have
hitherto
thought
myself
clever
fellow
but
from
henceforth
shall
consider
myself
just
the
contrary
and
only
what
the
word
confounded
just
so
said
i
well
said
the
jockey
as
you
say
you
can
speak
high
dutch
i
should
like
to
hear
you
and
master
six
foot
six
fire
away
at
each
other
i
can
not
speak
german
said
i
but
i
can
understand
tolerably
well
what
others
say
in
it
come
no
backing
out
said
the
jockey
let
hear
you
fire
away
for
the
glory
of
old
england
then
you
are
a
german
said
i
in
german
to
the
foreigner
that
will
do
said
the
jockey
keep
it
up
a
german
said
the
tall
foreigner
no
i
thank
god
that
i
do
not
belong
to
the
stupid
sluggish
germanic
race
but
to
a
braver
taller
and
handsomer
people
here
taking
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
he
stood
up
proudly
erect
so
that
his
head
nearly
touched
the
ceiling
of
the
room
then
reseating
himself
and
again
putting
the
syphon
to
his
lips
he
added
i
am
a
magyar
what
is
that
said
i
the
foreigner
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
somewhat
contemptuously
through
the
smoke
then
said
in
a
voice
of
thunder
a
hungarian
what
a
voice
the
chap
has
when
he
pleases
interposed
the
jockey
what
is
he
saying
merely
that
he
is
a
hungarian
said
i
but
i
added
the
conversation
of
this
gentleman
and
myself
in
a
language
which
you
ca
understand
must
be
very
tedious
to
you
we
had
better
give
it
up
keep
on
with
it
said
the
jockey
i
shall
go
on
listening
very
contentedly
till
i
fall
asleep
no
bad
thing
to
do
at
most
times
chapter
xxxix
the
hungarian
then
you
are
a
countryman
of
tekeli
and
of
the
queen
who
made
the
celebrated
water
said
i
speaking
to
the
hungarian
in
german
which
i
was
able
to
do
tolerably
well
owing
to
my
having
translated
the
publisher
philosophy
into
that
language
always
provided
i
did
not
attempt
to
say
much
at
a
time
ah
you
have
heard
of
tekeli
and
of
de
la
reine
how
is
that
i
have
seen
a
play
acted
founded
on
the
exploits
of
tekeli
and
have
read
pigault
le
brun
beautiful
romance
entitled
the
barons
of
felsheim
in
which
he
is
mentioned
as
for
the
water
i
have
heard
a
lady
the
wife
of
a
master
of
mine
speak
of
it
was
she
handsome
very
did
she
possess
the
water
i
should
say
not
for
i
have
heard
her
express
a
great
curiosity
about
it
was
she
growing
old
of
course
not
but
why
do
you
put
all
these
questions
because
the
water
is
said
to
make
people
handsome
and
above
all
to
restore
to
the
aged
the
beauty
of
their
youth
well
tekeli
was
my
countryman
and
i
have
the
honour
of
having
some
of
the
blood
of
the
tekelis
in
my
veins
but
with
respect
to
the
queen
pardon
me
if
i
tell
you
that
she
was
not
an
hungarian
she
was
a
pole
ersebet
by
name
daughter
of
wladislaus
locticus
king
of
poland
she
was
the
fourth
spouse
of
caroly
the
second
king
of
the
magyar
country
who
married
her
in
she
was
a
great
woman
and
celebrated
politician
though
at
present
chiefly
known
by
her
water
how
came
she
to
invent
it
if
her
own
account
may
be
believed
she
did
not
invent
it
after
her
death
as
i
have
read
in
florentius
of
buda
there
was
found
a
statement
of
the
manner
in
which
she
came
by
it
written
in
her
own
hand
on
a
of
her
breviary
to
the
following
effect
being
afflicted
with
a
grievous
disorder
at
the
age
of
she
received
the
medicine
which
was
called
her
water
from
an
old
hermit
whom
she
never
saw
before
or
afterwards
it
not
only
cured
her
but
restored
to
her
all
her
former
beauty
so
that
the
king
of
poland
fell
in
love
with
her
and
made
her
an
offer
of
marriage
which
she
refused
for
the
glory
of
god
from
whose
holy
angel
she
believed
she
had
received
the
water
the
receipt
for
making
it
and
directions
for
using
it
were
also
found
on
the
the
principal
component
parts
were
burnt
wine
and
rosemary
passed
through
an
alembic
a
drachm
of
it
was
to
be
taken
once
a
week
etelbenn
vagy
italbann
in
the
food
or
the
drink
early
in
the
morning
and
the
cheeks
were
to
be
moistened
with
it
every
day
the
effects
according
to
the
statement
were
wonderful
and
perhaps
they
were
upon
the
queen
but
whether
the
water
has
been
equally
efficacious
on
other
people
is
a
point
which
i
can
not
determine
i
should
wish
to
see
some
old
woman
who
has
been
restored
to
youthful
beauty
by
the
use
of
de
la
reine
perhaps
if
you
did
the
old
gentlewoman
would
hardly
be
so
ingenuous
as
the
queen
but
who
are
the
hungarians
descendants
of
attila
and
his
people
the
hungarian
shook
his
head
and
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
did
not
believe
that
his
nation
were
the
descendants
of
attila
and
his
people
though
he
acknowledged
that
they
were
probably
of
the
same
race
attila
and
his
armies
he
said
came
and
disappeared
in
a
very
mysterious
manner
and
that
nothing
could
be
said
with
positiveness
about
them
that
the
people
now
known
as
magyars
first
made
their
appearance
in
muscovy
in
the
year
under
the
leadership
of
almus
called
so
from
alom
which
in
the
hungarian
language
signifies
a
dream
his
mother
before
his
birth
having
dreamt
that
the
child
with
which
she
was
enceinte
would
be
the
father
of
a
long
succession
of
kings
which
in
fact
was
the
case
that
after
beating
the
russians
he
entered
hungary
and
coming
to
a
place
called
ungvar
from
which
many
people
believed
that
modern
hungary
derived
its
name
he
captured
it
and
held
in
it
a
grand
festival
which
lasted
four
days
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
resigned
the
leadership
of
the
magyars
to
his
son
arpad
this
arpad
and
his
magyars
utterly
subdued
pannonia
that
is
hungary
and
transylvania
wresting
the
government
of
it
from
the
sclavonian
tribes
who
inhabited
it
and
settling
down
amongst
them
as
conquerors
after
giving
me
this
information
the
hungarian
exclaimed
with
much
animation
a
goodly
country
that
which
they
had
entered
on
consisting
of
a
plain
surrounded
by
mountains
some
of
which
intersect
it
here
and
there
with
noble
rapid
rivers
the
grandest
of
which
is
the
mighty
dunau
a
country
with
tiny
volcanoes
casting
up
puffs
of
smoke
and
steam
and
from
which
hot
springs
arise
good
for
the
sick
with
many
fountains
some
of
which
are
so
pleasant
to
the
taste
as
to
be
preferred
to
wine
with
a
generous
soil
which
warmed
by
a
beautiful
sun
is
able
to
produce
corn
grapes
and
even
the
indian
weed
in
fact
one
of
the
finest
countries
in
the
world
which
even
a
spaniard
would
pronounce
to
be
nearly
equal
to
spain
here
they
rested
meditating
however
fresh
conquests
oh
the
magyars
soon
showed
themselves
a
mighty
people
besides
hungary
and
transylvania
they
subdued
bulgaria
and
bosnia
and
the
land
of
tot
now
called
sclavonia
the
generals
of
zoltan
the
son
of
arpad
led
troops
of
horsemen
to
the
banks
of
the
rhine
one
of
them
at
the
head
of
a
host
besieged
constantinople
it
was
then
that
botond
engaged
in
combat
with
a
greek
of
gigantic
stature
who
came
out
of
the
city
and
challenged
the
two
best
men
in
the
magyar
army
am
the
feeblest
of
the
magyars
said
botond
i
will
kill
thee
and
he
performed
his
word
having
previously
given
a
proof
of
the
feebleness
of
his
arm
by
striking
his
through
the
brazen
gate
making
a
hole
so
big
that
a
child
of
five
years
old
could
walk
through
it
of
what
religion
were
the
old
hungarians
they
had
some
idea
of
a
supreme
being
whom
they
called
isten
which
word
is
still
used
by
the
magyars
for
god
but
their
chief
devotion
was
directed
to
sorcerers
and
soothsayers
something
like
the
schamans
of
the
siberian
steppes
they
were
converted
to
christianity
chiefly
through
the
instrumentality
of
istvan
or
stephen
called
after
his
death
istvan
who
ascended
the
throne
in
the
year
one
thousand
he
was
born
in
heathenesse
and
his
original
name
was
vojk
he
was
the
first
kiraly
or
king
of
the
magyars
their
former
leaders
had
been
called
fejedelmek
or
dukes
the
magyar
language
has
properly
no
term
either
for
king
or
house
kiraly
is
a
word
derived
from
the
sclaves
haz
or
house
from
the
germans
who
first
taught
them
to
build
houses
their
original
dwellings
having
been
tilted
waggons
many
thanks
for
your
account
of
the
great
men
of
your
country
the
great
men
of
my
country
i
have
only
told
you
of
the
well
i
acknowledge
that
almus
and
arpad
were
great
men
but
hungary
has
produced
many
greater
i
will
not
trouble
you
by
recapitulating
all
but
there
is
one
name
i
can
not
forbear
mentioning
but
you
have
heard
of
it
even
at
horncastle
the
name
of
hunyadi
must
be
familiar
it
may
be
so
though
i
rather
doubt
it
but
however
that
may
be
i
confess
my
ignorance
i
have
never
until
this
moment
heard
the
name
of
hunyadi
not
of
hunyadi
janos
not
of
hunyadi
john
for
the
genius
of
our
language
compels
us
to
put
a
man
christian
name
after
his
other
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
the
name
of
corvinus
yes
i
have
heard
the
name
of
corvinus
by
my
god
i
am
glad
of
it
i
thought
our
hammer
of
destruction
our
thunderbolt
whom
the
greeks
called
achilles
must
be
known
to
the
people
of
horncastle
well
hunyadi
and
corvinus
are
the
same
corvinus
means
the
man
of
the
crow
or
raven
i
suppose
that
your
john
when
a
boy
climbed
up
to
a
crow
or
a
raven
nest
and
stole
the
young
a
bold
feat
well
befitting
a
young
hero
by
isten
you
are
an
acute
guesser
a
robbery
there
was
but
it
was
not
hunyadi
who
robbed
the
raven
but
the
raven
who
robbed
hunyadi
how
was
that
in
this
manner
hunyadi
according
to
tradition
was
the
son
of
king
sigmond
by
a
peasant
daughter
the
king
saw
and
fell
in
love
with
her
whilst
marching
against
the
vaivode
of
wallachia
he
had
some
difficulty
in
persuading
her
to
consent
to
his
wishes
and
she
only
yielded
at
last
on
the
king
making
her
a
solemn
promise
that
in
the
event
of
her
becoming
with
child
by
him
he
would
handsomely
provide
for
her
and
the
infant
the
king
proceeded
on
his
expedition
and
on
his
returning
in
triumph
from
wallachia
again
saw
the
girl
who
informed
him
that
she
was
enceinte
by
him
the
king
was
delighted
with
the
intelligence
gave
the
girl
money
and
at
the
same
time
a
ring
requesting
her
if
she
brought
forth
a
son
to
bring
the
ring
to
buda
with
the
child
and
present
it
to
him
when
her
time
was
up
the
peasant
daughter
brought
forth
a
fair
son
who
was
baptized
by
the
name
of
john
after
some
time
the
young
woman
communicated
the
whole
affair
to
her
elder
brother
whose
name
was
gaspar
and
begged
him
to
convey
her
and
the
child
to
the
king
at
buda
the
brother
consented
and
both
set
out
taking
the
child
with
them
on
their
way
the
woman
wanting
to
wash
her
clothes
laid
the
child
down
giving
it
the
king
ring
to
play
with
a
raven
who
saw
the
glittering
ring
came
flying
and
plucking
it
out
of
the
child
hand
carried
it
up
into
a
tree
the
child
suddenly
began
to
cry
and
the
mother
hearing
it
left
her
washing
and
running
to
the
child
forthwith
missed
the
ring
but
hearing
the
raven
croak
in
the
tree
she
lifted
up
her
eyes
and
saw
it
with
the
ring
in
its
beak
the
woman
in
great
terror
called
her
brother
and
told
him
what
had
happened
adding
that
she
durst
not
approach
the
king
if
the
raven
took
away
the
ring
gaspar
seizing
his
and
quiver
ran
to
the
tree
where
the
raven
was
yet
with
the
ring
and
discharged
an
arrow
at
it
but
being
in
a
great
hurry
he
missed
it
with
his
second
shot
he
was
more
lucky
for
he
hit
the
raven
in
the
breast
which
together
with
the
ring
fell
to
the
ground
taking
up
the
ring
they
went
on
their
way
and
shortly
arrived
at
buda
one
day
as
the
king
was
walking
after
dinner
in
his
outer
hall
the
woman
appeared
before
him
with
the
child
and
showing
him
the
ring
said
mighty
lord
behold
this
token
and
take
pity
upon
me
and
your
own
son
king
sigmond
took
the
child
and
kissed
it
and
after
a
pause
said
to
the
mother
you
have
done
right
in
bringing
me
the
boy
i
will
take
care
of
you
and
make
him
a
nobleman
the
king
was
as
good
as
his
word
he
provided
for
the
mother
caused
the
boy
to
be
instructed
in
knightly
exercises
and
made
him
a
present
of
the
town
of
hunyad
in
transylvania
on
which
account
he
was
afterwards
called
hunyadi
and
gave
him
as
an
armorial
sign
a
raven
bearing
a
ring
in
his
beak
such
oh
young
man
of
horncastle
is
the
popular
account
of
the
birth
of
the
great
captain
of
hungary
as
related
by
florentius
of
buda
there
are
other
accounts
of
his
birth
which
is
indeed
involved
in
much
mystery
and
of
the
reason
of
his
being
called
corvinus
but
as
this
is
the
most
pleasing
and
is
upon
the
whole
founded
on
quite
as
good
evidence
as
the
others
i
have
selected
it
for
recitation
i
heartily
thank
you
but
you
must
tell
me
something
more
of
hunyadi
you
call
him
your
great
captain
what
did
he
do
do
what
no
other
man
of
his
day
could
have
done
he
broke
the
power
of
the
turk
when
he
was
coming
to
overwhelm
europe
from
the
blows
inflicted
by
hunyadi
the
turk
never
thoroughly
recovered
he
has
been
frequently
worsted
in
latter
times
but
none
but
hunyadi
could
have
routed
the
armies
of
amurath
and
mahomed
the
second
how
was
it
that
he
had
an
opportunity
of
displaying
his
military
genius
i
can
hardly
tell
you
but
his
valour
soon
made
him
famous
king
albert
made
him
ban
of
szorenyi
he
became
eventually
waivode
of
transylvania
and
governor
of
hungary
his
first
grand
action
was
the
defeat
of
bashaw
isack
and
though
himself
surprised
and
routed
at
imre
he
speedily
regained
his
prestige
by
defeating
the
turks
with
enormous
slaughter
killing
their
leader
mezerbeg
and
subsequently
at
the
battle
of
the
iron
gates
he
destroyed
ninety
thousand
turks
sent
by
amurath
to
avenge
the
late
disgrace
it
was
then
that
the
greeks
called
him
achilles
he
was
not
always
successful
who
could
be
always
successful
against
the
early
turk
he
was
defeated
in
the
battle
in
which
king
vladislaus
lost
his
life
but
his
victories
outnumbered
his
defeats
his
grandest
victory
perhaps
the
grandest
ever
achieved
by
man
was
over
the
terrible
mahomed
the
second
who
after
the
taking
of
constantinople
in
said
one
god
in
heaven
one
king
on
earth
and
marched
to
besiege
belgrade
at
the
head
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
swearing
by
the
beard
of
the
prophet
that
he
would
sup
within
it
ere
two
months
were
elapsed
he
brought
with
him
dogs
to
eat
the
bodies
of
the
christians
whom
he
should
take
or
slay
so
says
florentius
hear
what
he
also
says
the
turk
sat
down
before
the
town
towards
the
end
of
june
covering
the
dunau
and
szava
with
ships
and
on
the
of
july
he
began
to
cannonade
belgrade
with
cannons
feet
long
whose
roar
could
be
heard
at
szeged
a
distance
of
leagues
at
which
place
hunyadi
had
assembled
his
forces
hunyadi
had
been
able
to
raise
only
fifteen
thousand
of
and
disciplined
men
though
he
had
with
him
vast
bands
of
people
who
called
themselves
soldiers
of
the
cross
but
who
consisted
of
inexperienced
lads
from
school
peasants
and
hermits
armed
with
swords
slings
and
clubs
hunyadi
undismayed
by
the
great
disparity
between
his
forces
and
those
of
the
turk
advanced
to
relieve
belgrade
and
encamped
at
szalankemen
with
his
army
there
he
saw
at
once
that
his
first
step
must
be
to
attack
the
flotilla
he
therefore
privately
informed
szilagy
his
wife
brother
who
at
that
time
defended
belgrade
that
it
was
his
intention
to
attack
the
ships
of
the
turks
on
the
day
of
july
in
front
and
requested
his
in
the
rear
on
the
came
on
the
commencement
of
the
great
battle
of
belgrade
between
hunyadi
and
the
turk
many
days
it
lasted
describe
it
i
can
not
one
has
described
it
well
florentius
of
buda
i
can
only
repeat
a
few
of
his
words
on
the
appointed
day
hunyadi
with
two
hundred
vessels
attacked
the
turkish
flotilla
in
front
whilst
szilagy
with
forty
vessels
filled
with
the
men
of
belgrade
assailed
it
in
the
rear
striving
for
the
same
object
they
sunk
many
of
the
turkish
vessels
captured
burnt
many
and
utterly
annihilated
the
whole
fleet
after
this
victory
hunyadi
with
his
army
entered
belgrade
to
the
great
joy
of
the
magyars
but
though
the
force
of
mahomed
upon
the
water
was
destroyed
that
upon
the
land
remained
entire
and
with
this
during
six
days
and
nights
he
attacked
the
city
without
intermission
destroying
its
walls
in
many
parts
his
last
and
most
desperate
assault
was
made
on
the
day
of
july
twice
did
the
turks
gain
possession
of
the
outer
town
and
twice
was
it
retaken
with
indescribable
slaughter
the
next
day
the
combat
raged
without
ceasing
till
when
the
turks
were
again
beaten
out
of
the
town
and
pursued
by
the
magyars
to
their
camp
there
the
combat
was
renewed
both
sides
displaying
the
greatest
obstinacy
until
mahomed
received
a
great
wound
over
his
left
eye
the
turks
then
turning
their
faces
fled
leaving
behind
them
three
hundred
cannon
in
the
hands
of
the
christians
and
more
than
thousand
slain
on
the
field
of
battle
after
that
battle
i
suppose
hunyadi
enjoyed
his
triumphs
in
peace
in
the
deepest
for
he
shortly
died
his
great
soul
quitted
his
body
which
was
exhausted
by
almost
superhuman
exertions
on
the
of
august
shortly
before
he
died
according
to
florentius
a
comet
appeared
sent
as
it
would
seem
to
announce
his
coming
end
the
whole
christian
world
mourned
his
loss
the
pope
ordered
the
cardinals
to
perform
a
funeral
ceremony
at
rome
in
his
honour
his
great
enemy
himself
grieved
for
him
and
pronounced
his
finest
eulogium
when
mahomed
the
second
heard
of
his
death
he
struck
his
head
for
some
time
against
the
ground
without
speaking
suddenly
he
broke
silence
with
these
words
notwithstanding
he
was
my
enemy
yet
do
i
bewail
his
loss
since
the
sun
has
shone
in
heaven
no
prince
had
ever
yet
such
a
man
what
was
the
name
of
his
prince
laszlo
the
fifth
who
though
under
infinite
obligations
to
hunyadi
was
anything
but
grateful
to
him
for
he
once
consented
to
a
plan
which
was
laid
to
assassinate
him
contrived
by
his
mortal
enemy
ulrik
count
of
cilejia
and
after
hunyadi
death
caused
his
eldest
son
hunyadi
laszlo
to
be
executed
on
a
false
accusation
and
imprisoned
his
younger
son
matyas
who
on
the
death
of
laszlo
was
elected
by
the
magyars
to
be
their
king
on
the
of
january
was
this
matyas
a
good
king
was
matyas
corvinus
a
good
king
o
young
man
of
horncastle
he
was
the
best
and
greatest
that
ever
hungary
possessed
and
after
his
father
the
most
renowned
warrior
some
of
our
best
laws
were
framed
by
him
it
was
he
who
organized
the
hussar
force
and
it
was
he
who
took
vienna
why
does
your
government
always
send
fools
to
represent
it
at
vienna
i
really
can
not
say
but
with
respect
to
the
hussar
force
is
it
of
hungarian
origin
its
name
shows
its
origin
huz
in
hungarian
is
twenty
and
the
hussar
force
is
so
called
because
it
is
formed
of
twentieths
a
law
was
issued
by
which
it
was
ordered
that
every
hungarian
nobleman
out
of
every
twenty
dependents
should
produce
a
horseman
and
with
him
proceed
to
the
field
of
battle
why
did
matyas
capture
venna
because
the
emperor
frederick
took
part
against
him
with
the
king
of
poland
who
claimed
the
kingdom
of
hungary
for
his
son
and
had
also
assisted
the
turk
he
captured
it
in
the
year
but
did
not
survive
his
triumph
long
expiring
there
in
the
year
he
was
so
veracious
a
man
that
it
was
said
of
him
after
his
death
truth
died
with
matyas
it
might
be
added
that
the
glory
of
hungary
departed
with
him
i
wish
to
say
nothing
more
connected
with
hungarian
history
another
word
did
matyas
leave
a
son
a
natural
son
hunyadi
john
called
so
after
the
great
man
he
would
have
been
universally
acknowledged
as
king
of
hungary
but
for
the
illegitimacy
of
his
birth
as
it
was
ulaszlo
the
son
of
the
king
of
poland
afterwards
called
ulaszlo
the
second
who
claimed
hungary
as
being
descended
from
albert
was
nominated
king
by
a
great
majority
of
the
magyar
electors
hunyadi
john
for
some
time
disputed
the
throne
with
him
there
was
some
bloodshed
but
hunyadi
john
eventually
submitted
and
became
the
faithful
captain
of
ulaszlo
notwithstanding
that
the
turk
offered
to
assist
him
with
an
army
of
two
hundred
thousand
men
go
on
to
what
tche
drak
to
the
mohacs
veszedelem
ulaszlo
left
a
son
lajos
the
second
born
without
skin
as
it
is
said
certainly
without
a
head
he
contrary
to
the
advice
of
all
his
wise
counsellors
and
amongst
them
was
batory
stephen
who
became
eventually
king
of
poland
engaged
with
thousand
men
at
mohacs
soliman
the
turk
who
had
an
army
of
two
hundred
thousand
drak
the
magyars
were
annihilated
king
lajos
disappeared
with
his
heavy
horse
and
armour
in
a
bog
we
call
that
battle
which
was
fought
on
the
of
august
the
destruction
of
mohacs
but
it
was
the
destruction
of
hungary
you
have
twice
used
the
word
drak
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
is
it
hungarian
no
it
belongs
to
the
mad
wallacks
they
are
a
nation
of
madmen
on
the
other
side
of
transylvania
their
country
was
formerly
a
fief
of
hungary
like
moldavia
which
is
inhabited
by
the
same
race
who
speak
the
same
language
and
are
equally
mad
what
language
do
they
speak
a
strange
mixture
of
latin
and
sclavonian
they
themselves
being
a
mixed
race
of
romans
and
sclavonians
trajan
sent
certain
legions
to
form
military
colonies
in
dacia
and
the
present
wallacks
and
moldavians
are
to
a
certain
extent
the
descendants
of
the
roman
soldiers
who
married
the
women
of
the
country
i
say
to
a
certain
extent
for
the
sclavonian
element
both
in
blood
and
language
seems
to
prevail
and
what
is
drak
dragon
which
the
wallacks
use
for
devil
the
term
is
curious
as
it
shows
that
the
old
romans
looked
upon
the
dragon
as
an
infernal
being
you
have
been
in
wallachia
i
have
and
glad
i
was
to
get
out
of
it
i
hate
the
mad
wallacks
why
do
you
call
them
mad
they
are
always
drinking
or
talking
i
never
saw
a
wallachian
eating
or
silent
they
talk
like
madmen
and
drink
like
madmen
in
drinking
they
use
small
phials
the
contents
of
which
they
pour
down
their
throats
when
i
first
went
amongst
them
i
thought
the
whole
nation
was
under
a
course
of
physic
but
the
terrible
jabber
of
their
tongues
soon
undeceived
me
drak
was
the
first
word
i
heard
on
entering
dacia
and
the
last
when
i
left
it
the
moldaves
if
possible
drink
more
and
talk
more
than
the
wallachians
it
is
singular
enough
that
the
only
moldavian
i
have
known
could
not
speak
i
suppose
he
was
born
dumb
a
moldavian
born
dumb
excuse
me
the
thing
is
impossible
all
moldavians
are
born
talking
i
have
known
a
moldavian
who
could
not
speak
but
he
was
not
born
dumb
his
master
an
armenian
snipped
off
part
of
his
tongue
at
adrianople
he
drove
him
mad
with
his
jabber
he
is
now
in
london
where
his
master
has
a
house
i
have
letters
of
credit
on
the
house
the
clerk
paid
me
money
in
london
the
master
was
absent
the
money
which
you
received
for
the
horse
belonged
to
that
house
another
word
with
respect
to
hungarian
history
drak
i
wish
to
say
nothing
more
about
hungarian
history
the
turk
i
suppose
after
mohacs
got
possession
of
hungary
not
exactly
the
turk
upon
the
whole
showed
great
moderation
not
so
the
austrian
ferdinand
the
first
claimed
the
crown
of
hungary
as
being
the
cousin
of
maria
widow
of
lajos
he
found
too
many
disposed
to
support
him
his
claim
however
was
resisted
by
zapolya
john
a
hungarian
magnate
who
caused
himself
to
be
elected
king
hungary
was
for
a
long
time
devastated
by
wars
between
the
partisans
of
zapolya
and
ferdinand
at
last
zapolya
called
in
the
turk
soliman
behaved
generously
to
him
and
after
his
death
befriended
his
young
son
and
isabella
his
queen
eventually
the
turks
became
masters
of
transylvania
and
the
greater
part
of
hungary
they
were
not
bad
masters
and
had
many
friends
in
hungary
especially
amongst
those
of
the
reformed
faith
to
which
i
have
myself
the
honour
of
belonging
those
of
the
reformed
faith
found
the
mufti
more
tolerant
than
the
pope
many
hungarians
went
with
the
turks
to
the
siege
of
vienna
whilst
tekeli
and
his
horsemen
guarded
hungary
for
them
a
gallant
enterprise
that
siege
of
vienna
the
last
great
effort
of
the
turk
it
failed
and
he
speedily
lost
hungary
but
he
did
not
sneak
from
hungary
like
a
frightened
hound
his
defence
of
buda
will
not
be
soon
forgotten
where
apty
basha
the
governor
died
fighting
like
a
lion
in
the
breach
there
many
a
hungarian
would
prefer
stamboul
to
vienna
why
does
your
government
always
send
fools
to
represent
it
at
vienna
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
can
not
say
what
became
of
tekeli
when
hungary
was
lost
he
retired
with
the
turks
into
turkey
count
renoncourt
in
his
memoirs
mentions
having
seen
him
at
adrianople
the
sultan
in
consideration
of
the
services
which
he
had
rendered
to
the
moslem
in
hungary
made
over
the
revenues
of
certain
towns
and
districts
for
his
subsistence
the
count
says
that
he
always
went
armed
to
the
teeth
and
was
always
attended
by
a
young
female
dressed
in
male
attire
who
had
followed
him
in
his
wars
and
had
more
than
once
saved
his
life
his
end
is
wrapped
in
mystery
i
whose
greatest
boast
next
to
being
a
hungarian
is
to
be
of
his
blood
know
nothing
of
his
end
allow
me
to
ask
who
you
are
egy
szegeny
magyar
nemes
ember
a
poor
hungarian
nobleman
son
of
one
yet
poorer
i
was
born
in
transylvania
not
far
to
the
west
of
good
coloscvar
i
served
some
time
in
the
austrian
army
as
a
noble
hussar
but
am
now
equerry
to
a
great
nobleman
to
whom
i
am
distantly
related
in
his
service
i
have
travelled
far
and
wide
buying
horses
i
have
been
in
russia
and
in
turkey
and
am
now
at
horncastle
where
i
have
had
the
satisfaction
to
meet
with
you
and
to
buy
your
horse
which
is
in
truth
a
noble
brute
for
a
soldier
and
equerry
you
seem
to
know
a
great
deal
of
the
history
of
your
country
all
i
know
is
derived
from
florentius
of
buda
whom
we
call
budai
ferentz
he
was
professor
of
greek
and
latin
at
the
reformed
college
of
debreczen
where
i
was
educated
he
wrote
a
work
entitled
magyar
polgari
lexicon
lives
of
great
hungarian
citizens
he
was
dead
before
i
was
born
but
i
found
his
book
when
i
was
a
child
in
the
solitary
home
of
my
father
which
stood
on
the
confines
of
a
puszta
or
wilderness
and
that
book
i
used
to
devour
in
winter
nights
when
the
winds
were
whistling
around
the
house
oh
how
my
blood
used
to
glow
at
the
descriptions
of
magyar
valour
and
likewise
of
turkish
for
florentius
has
always
done
justice
to
the
turk
many
a
passage
similar
to
this
have
i
got
by
heart
it
is
connected
with
a
battle
on
the
plain
of
rigo
which
hunyadi
lost
the
next
day
which
was
friday
as
the
two
armies
were
drawn
up
in
battle
array
a
magyar
hero
riding
forth
galloped
up
and
down
challenging
the
turks
to
single
combat
then
came
out
to
meet
him
the
son
of
a
renowned
bashaw
of
asia
rushing
upon
each
other
both
broke
their
lances
but
the
magyar
hero
and
his
horse
rolled
over
upon
the
ground
for
the
turks
had
always
the
best
horses
o
young
man
of
horncastle
if
ever
you
learn
hungarian
and
learn
it
assuredly
you
will
after
what
i
have
told
you
read
the
book
of
florentius
of
buda
even
if
you
go
to
hungary
to
get
it
for
you
will
scarcely
find
it
elsewhere
and
even
there
with
difficulty
for
the
book
has
been
long
out
of
print
it
describes
the
actions
of
the
great
men
of
hungary
down
to
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
besides
being
written
in
the
purest
hungarian
has
the
merit
of
having
for
its
author
a
professor
of
the
reformed
college
of
debreczen
i
will
go
to
hungary
rather
than
not
read
it
i
am
glad
that
the
turk
beat
the
magyar
when
i
used
to
read
the
ballads
of
spain
i
always
sided
with
the
moor
against
the
christian
it
was
a
drawn
fight
after
all
for
the
terrible
horse
of
the
turk
presently
flung
his
own
master
whereupon
the
two
champions
returned
to
their
respective
armies
but
in
the
grand
conflict
which
ensued
the
turks
beat
the
magyars
pursuing
them
till
night
and
striking
them
on
the
necks
with
their
scymetars
the
turk
is
a
noble
fellow
i
should
wish
to
be
a
turk
were
i
not
a
magyar
the
turk
always
keeps
his
word
i
am
told
which
the
christian
very
seldom
does
and
even
the
hungarian
does
not
always
in
ulaszlo
made
at
szeged
peace
with
amurath
for
ten
years
which
he
swore
with
an
oath
to
keep
but
at
the
instigation
of
the
pope
julian
he
broke
it
and
induced
his
great
captain
hunyadi
john
to
share
in
the
perjury
the
consequence
was
the
battle
of
varna
of
the
of
november
in
which
hunyadi
was
routed
and
ulaszlo
slain
did
you
ever
hear
his
epitaph
it
is
both
solemn
and
edifying
romulidae

nisi

said
the
jockey
starting
up
from
a
doze
in
which
he
had
been
indulging
for
the
last
hour
his
head
leaning
upon
his
breast
what
is
that
that
not
high
dutch
i
bargained
for
high
dutch
and
i
left
you
speaking
high
dutch
as
it
sounded
very
much
like
the
language
of
horses
as
i
have
been
told
high
dutch
does
but
as
for
what
you
are
speaking
now
whatever
you
may
call
it
it
sounds
more
like
the
language
of
another
kind
of
animal
i
suppose
you
want
to
insult
me
because
i
was
once
a
nothing
of
the
kind
said
i
the
gentleman
was
making
a
quotation
in
latin
latin
was
it
said
the
jockey
that
alters
the
case
latin
is
genteel
and
i
have
sent
my
eldest
boy
to
an
academy
to
learn
it
come
let
us
hear
you
fire
away
in
latin
he
continued
proceeding
to
his
pipe
which
before
going
to
sleep
he
had
laid
on
the
table
if
you
wish
to
follow
the
discourse
in
latin
said
the
hungarian
in
very
bad
english
i
can
oblige
you
i
learned
to
speak
very
good
latin
in
the
college
of
debreczen
that
more
said
i
than
i
have
done
in
the
colleges
where
i
have
been
in
any
little
conversation
which
we
may
yet
have
i
wish
you
would
use
german
well
said
the
jockey
taking
a
whiff
make
your
conversation
as
short
as
possible
whether
in
latin
or
dutch
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
rather
tired
of
merely
playing
listener
you
were
saying
you
had
been
in
russia
said
i
i
believe
the
russians
are
part
of
the
sclavonian
race
yes
part
of
the
great
sclavonian
family
one
of
the
most
numerous
races
in
the
world
the
russians
themselves
are
very
numerous
would
that
the
magyars
could
boast
of
the
fifth
part
of
their
number
what
is
the
number
of
the
magyars
barely
four
millions
we
came
a
tribe
of
tartars
into
europe
and
settled
down
amongst
sclavonians
whom
we
conquered
but
who
never
coalesced
with
us
the
austrian
at
present
plays
in
pannonia
the
sclavonian
against
us
and
us
against
the
sclavonian
but
the
downfall
of
the
austrian
is
at
hand
they
like
us
are
not
a
numerous
people
who
will
bring
about
his
downfall
the
russians
the
rysckie
tsar
will
lead
his
people
forth
all
the
sclavonians
will
join
him
he
will
conquer
all
before
him
are
the
russians
good
soldiers
they
are
stubborn
and
unflinching
to
an
astonishing
degree
and
their
fidelity
to
their
tsar
is
quite
admirable
see
how
the
russians
behaved
at
plescova
in
livonia
in
the
old
time
against
our
great
batory
stephen
they
defended
the
place
till
it
was
a
heap
of
rubbish
and
mark
how
they
behaved
after
they
had
been
made
prisoners
stephen
offered
them
two
alternatives
to
enter
into
his
service
in
which
they
would
have
good
pay
clothing
and
fair
treatment
or
to
be
allowed
to
return
to
russia
without
the
slightest
hesitation
they
to
a
man
chose
the
latter
though
well
aware
that
their
beloved
tsar
the
cruel
ivan
basilowits
would
put
them
all
to
death
amidst
tortures
the
most
horrible
for
not
doing
what
was
impossible
preserving
the
town
you
speak
russian
a
little
i
was
born
in
the
vicinity
of
a
sclavonian
tribe
the
servants
of
our
house
were
sclavonians
and
i
early
acquired
something
of
their
language
which
differs
not
much
from
that
of
russia
when
in
that
country
i
quickly
understood
what
was
said
have
the
russians
any
literature
doubtless
but
i
am
not
acquainted
with
it
as
i
do
not
read
their
language
but
i
know
something
of
their
popular
tales
to
which
i
used
to
listen
in
their
izbushkas
a
principal
personage
in
these
is
a
creation
quite
original
called
baba
yaga
who
is
the
baba
yaga
a
female
phantom
who
is
described
as
hurrying
along
the
puszta
or
steppe
in
a
mortar
pounding
with
a
pestle
at
a
tremendous
rate
and
leaving
a
long
trace
on
the
ground
behind
her
with
her
tongue
which
is
three
yards
long
and
with
which
she
seizes
any
men
and
horses
coming
in
her
way
swallowing
them
down
into
her
capacious
belly
she
has
several
daughters
very
handsome
and
with
plenty
of
money
happy
the
young
mujik
who
catches
and
marries
one
of
them
for
they
make
excellent
wives
many
thanks
said
i
for
the
information
you
have
afforded
me
this
is
rather
poor
wine
i
observed
as
i
poured
out
a
glass
i
suppose
you
have
better
wine
in
hungary
yes
we
have
better
wine
in
hungary
first
of
all
there
is
tokay
the
most
celebrated
in
the
world
though
i
confess
i
prefer
the
wine
of
eger
tokay
is
too
sweet
have
you
ever
been
at
tokay
i
have
said
the
hungarian
what
kind
of
place
is
tokay
a
small
town
situated
on
the
tyzza
a
rapid
river
descending
from
the
north
the
tokay
mountain
is
just
behind
the
town
which
stands
on
the
right
bank
the
top
of
the
mountain
is
called
kopacs
teto
or
the
bald
tip
the
hill
is
so
steep
that
during
pieces
frequently
fall
down
upon
the
roofs
of
the
houses
it
was
planted
with
vines
by
king
lajos
who
ascended
the
throne
in
the
best
wine
called
tokay
is
however
not
made
at
tokay
but
at
kassau
two
leagues
farther
into
the
carpathians
of
which
tokay
is
a
spur
if
you
wish
to
drink
the
best
tokay
you
must
go
to
vienna
to
which
place
all
the
prime
is
sent
for
the
third
time
i
ask
you
o
young
man
of
horncastle
why
does
your
government
always
send
fools
to
represent
it
at
vienna
and
for
the
third
time
i
tell
you
o
son
of
almus
that
i
can
not
say
perhaps
however
to
drink
the
sweet
tokay
wine
fools
you
know
always
like
sweet
things
good
said
the
hungarian
it
must
be
so
and
when
i
return
to
hungary
i
will
state
to
my
countrymen
your
explanation
of
a
circumstance
which
has
frequently
caused
them
great
perplexity
oh
the
english
are
a
clever
people
and
have
a
deep
meaning
in
all
they
do
what
a
vision
of
deep
policy
opens
itself
to
my
view
they
do
not
send
their
fool
to
vienna
in
order
to
gape
at
processions
and
to
bow
and
scrape
at
a
base
papist
court
but
to
drink
at
the
great
dinners
the
celebrated
tokay
of
hungary
which
the
hungarians
though
they
do
not
drink
it
are
very
proud
of
and
by
doing
so
to
intimate
the
sympathy
which
the
english
entertain
for
their
fellow
religionists
of
hungary
oh
the
english
are
a
deep
people
chapter
xl
the
horncastle
welcome
tzernebock
and
bielebock
the
pipe
of
the
hungarian
had
for
some
time
past
exhibited
considerable
symptoms
of
exhaustion
little
or
no
ruttling
having
been
heard
in
the
tube
and
scarcely
a
particle
of
smoke
drawn
through
the
syphon
having
been
emitted
from
the
lips
of
the
possessor
he
now
rose
from
his
seat
and
going
to
a
corner
of
the
room
placed
his
pipe
against
the
wall
then
striding
up
and
down
the
room
he
cracked
his
fingers
several
times
exclaiming
in
a
manner
oh
the
deep
nation
which
in
order
to
display
its
sympathy
for
hungary
sends
its
fool
to
vienna
to
drink
the
sweet
wine
of
tokay
the
jockey
having
looked
for
some
time
at
the
tall
figure
with
evident
approbation
winked
at
me
with
that
brilliant
eye
of
his
on
which
there
was
no
speck
saying
you
ever
see
a
taller
fellow
never
said
i
or
a
finer
that
another
question
said
i
which
i
am
not
so
willing
to
answer
however
as
i
am
fond
of
truth
and
scorn
to
flatter
i
will
take
the
liberty
of
saying
that
i
have
seen
a
finer
a
finer
where
said
the
jockey
whilst
the
hungarian
who
appeared
to
understand
what
we
said
stood
still
and
looked
full
at
me
amongst
a
strange
set
of
people
said
i
whom
if
i
were
to
name
you
would
i
dare
say
only
laugh
at
me
who
be
they
said
the
jockey
come
do
be
ashamed
i
have
occasionally
kept
queerish
company
myself
the
people
whom
we
call
gypsies
said
i
whom
the
germans
call
zigeuner
and
who
call
themselves
romany
chals
zigeuner
said
the
hungarian
by
isten
i
do
know
those
people
romany
chals
said
the
jockey
whew
i
begin
to
smell
a
rat
what
do
you
mean
by
smelling
a
rat
said
i
i
bet
a
crown
said
the
jockey
that
you
be
the
young
chap
what
certain
folks
call
romany
rye
ah
said
i
how
came
you
to
know
that
name
be
not
you
he
said
the
jockey
why
i
certainly
have
been
called
by
that
name
i
could
have
sworn
it
said
the
jockey
then
rising
from
his
chair
he
laid
his
pipe
on
the
table
took
a
large
which
stood
on
the
and
going
to
the
door
opened
it
and
commenced
ringing
in
a
most
tremendous
manner
on
the
staircase
the
noise
presently
brought
up
a
waiter
to
whom
the
jockey
vociferated
go
to
your
master
and
tell
him
to
send
immediately
three
bottles
of
champagne
of
the
pink
kind
mind
you
which
is
twelve
guineas
a
dozen
the
waiter
hurried
away
and
the
jockey
resumed
his
seat
and
his
pipe
i
sat
in
silent
astonishment
until
the
waiter
returned
with
a
basket
containing
the
wine
which
with
three
long
glasses
he
placed
on
the
table
the
jockey
then
got
up
and
going
to
a
large
at
the
end
of
the
room
which
looked
into
a
peeped
out
then
saying
the
coast
is
clear
he
shut
down
the
principal
sash
which
was
open
for
the
sake
of
the
air
and
taking
up
a
bottle
of
champagne
he
placed
another
in
the
hands
of
the
hungarian
to
whom
he
said
something
in
private
the
latter
who
seemed
to
understand
him
answered
by
a
nod
the
two
then
going
to
the
end
of
the
table
fronting
the
window
and
about
eight
paces
from
it
stood
before
it
holding
the
bottles
by
their
necks
suddenly
the
jockey
lifted
up
his
arm
surely
said
i
you
are
not
mad
enough
to
fling
that
bottle
through
the
window
here
to
the
romany
rye
here
to
the
sweet
master
said
the
jockey
dashing
the
bottle
through
the
pane
in
so
neat
a
manner
that
scarcely
a
particle
of
glass
fell
into
the
room
eljen
edes
csigany
ur
eljen
gul
eray
said
the
hungarian
swinging
round
his
bottle
and
discharging
it
at
the
window
but
either
not
possessing
the
jockey
accuracy
of
aim
or
reckless
of
the
consequences
he
flung
his
bottle
so
that
it
struck
against
part
of
the
wooden
setting
of
the
panes
breaking
along
with
the
wood
and
itself
three
or
four
panes
to
pieces
the
crash
was
horrid
and
wine
and
particles
of
glass
flew
back
into
the
room
to
the
no
small
danger
of
its
inmates
what
do
you
think
of
that
said
the
jockey
were
you
ever
so
honoured
before
honoured
said
i
god
preserve
me
in
future
from
such
honour
and
i
put
my
finger
to
my
cheek
which
was
slightly
hurt
by
a
particle
of
the
glass
that
the
way
we
of
the
cofrady
honour
great
men
at
horncastle
said
the
jockey
what
you
are
hurt
never
mind
all
the
better
your
scratch
shows
that
you
are
the
body
the
compliment
was
paid
to
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
other
bottle
said
i
do
with
it
said
the
jockey
why
drink
it
cosily
and
comfortably
whilst
holding
a
little
quiet
talk
the
romany
rye
at
horncastle
what
an
idea
and
what
will
the
master
of
the
house
say
to
all
this
damage
which
you
have
caused
him
what
will
your
master
say
william
said
the
jockey
to
the
waiter
who
had
witnessed
the
singular
scene
just
described
without
exhibiting
the
slightest
mark
of
surprise
william
smiled
and
slightly
shrugging
his
shoulders
replied
very
little
i
dare
say
sir
this
the
first
time
your
honour
has
done
a
thing
of
this
kind
nor
will
it
be
the
first
time
that
i
shall
have
paid
for
it
said
the
jockey
well
i
shall
never
have
paid
for
a
certain
item
in
the
bill
with
more
pleasure
than
i
shall
pay
for
it
now
come
william
draw
the
cork
and
let
us
taste
the
pink
champagne
the
waiter
drew
the
cork
and
filled
the
glasses
with
a
pinky
liquor
which
bubbled
hissed
and
foamed
how
do
you
like
it
said
the
jockey
after
i
had
imitated
the
example
of
my
companions
by
despatching
my
portion
at
a
draught
it
is
wonderful
wine
said
i
i
have
never
tasted
champagne
before
though
i
have
frequently
heard
it
praised
it
more
than
answers
my
expectations
but
i
confess
i
should
not
wish
to
be
obliged
to
drink
it
every
day
nor
i
said
the
jockey
for
drinking
give
me
a
glass
of
old
port
or
of
hard
old
ale
i
interposed
which
according
to
my
mind
is
better
than
all
the
wine
in
the
world
well
said
romany
rye
said
the
jockey
just
my
own
opinion
now
william
make
yourself
scarce
the
waiter
withdrew
and
i
said
to
the
jockey
how
did
you
become
acquainted
with
the
romany
chals
i
first
became
acquainted
with
them
said
the
jockey
when
i
lived
with
old
fulcher
the
basketmaker
who
took
me
up
when
i
was
adrift
upon
the
world
i
do
not
mean
the
present
fulcher
who
is
likewise
called
old
fulcher
but
his
father
who
has
been
dead
this
many
a
year
while
living
with
him
in
the
caravan
i
frequently
met
them
in
the
green
lanes
and
of
latter
years
i
have
had
occasional
dealings
with
them
in
the
horse
line
and
the
gypsies
have
mentioned
me
to
you
said
i
frequently
said
the
jockey
and
not
only
those
of
these
parts
why
there
scarcely
a
part
of
england
in
which
i
have
not
heard
the
name
of
the
romany
rye
mentioned
by
these
people
the
power
you
have
over
them
is
wonderful
that
is
i
should
have
thought
it
wonderful
had
they
not
more
than
once
told
me
the
cause
and
what
is
the
cause
said
i
for
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
the
cause
is
this
said
the
jockey
they
never
heard
a
bad
word
proceed
from
your
mouth
and
never
knew
you
do
a
bad
thing
they
are
a
singular
people
said
i
and
what
a
singular
language
they
have
got
said
the
jockey
do
you
know
it
said
i
only
a
few
words
said
the
jockey
they
were
always
chary
in
teaching
me
any
they
were
vary
sherry
to
me
too
said
the
hungarian
speaking
in
broken
english
i
only
could
learn
from
them
words
for
example
gul
eray
which
in
the
czigany
of
my
country
means
sweet
gentleman
or
edes
ur
in
my
own
magyar
gudlo
rye
in
the
romany
of
mine
means
a
sugar
gentleman
said
i
then
there
are
gypsies
in
your
country
plenty
said
the
hungarian
speaking
german
and
in
russia
and
turkey
too
and
wherever
they
are
found
they
are
alike
in
their
ways
and
language
oh
they
are
a
strange
race
and
how
little
known
i
know
little
of
them
but
enough
to
say
that
one
of
nonsense
has
been
written
about
them
there
is
one
valter
scott
mind
what
you
say
about
him
said
i
he
is
our
grand
authority
in
matters
of
philology
and
history
a
pretty
philologist
said
the
hungarian
who
makes
the
gypsies
speak
the
dialect
of
thieves
a
pretty
historian
who
couples
together
thor
and
tzernebock
where
does
he
do
that
said
i
in
his
conceited
romance
of
he
couples
thor
and
tzernebock
together
and
calls
them
gods
of
the
heathen
saxons
well
said
i
thur
or
thor
was
certainly
a
god
of
the
heathen
saxons
true
said
the
hungarian
but
why
couple
him
with
tzernebock
tzernebock
was
a
word
which
your
valter
had
picked
up
somewhere
without
knowing
the
meaning
tzernebock
was
no
god
of
the
saxons
but
one
of
the
gods
of
the
sclaves
on
the
southern
side
of
the
baltic
the
sclaves
had
two
grand
gods
to
whom
they
sacrificed
tzernebock
and
bielebock
that
is
the
black
and
white
gods
who
represented
the
powers
of
dark
and
light
they
were
overturned
by
waldemar
the
dane
the
great
enemy
of
the
sclaves
the
account
of
whose
wars
you
will
find
in
one
fine
old
book
written
by
saxo
gramaticus
which
i
read
in
the
library
of
the
college
of
debreczen
the
sclaves
at
one
time
were
masters
of
all
the
southern
shore
of
the
baltic
where
their
descendants
are
still
to
be
found
though
they
have
lost
their
language
and
call
themselves
germans
but
the
word
zernevitz
near
dantzic
still
attests
that
the
sclavic
language
was
once
common
in
those
parts
zernevitz
means
the
thing
of
blackness
as
tzernebock
means
the
god
of
blackness
prussia
itself
merely
means
in
sclavish
lower
russia
there
is
scarcely
a
race
or
language
in
the
world
more
extended
than
the
sclavic
on
the
other
side
of
the
dunau
you
will
find
the
sclaves
and
their
language
czernavoda
is
sclavic
and
means
black
water
in
turkish
kara
su
even
as
tzernebock
means
black
god
and
belgrade
or
belograd
means
the
white
town
even
as
bielebock
or
bielebog
means
the
white
god
oh
he
is
one
great
ignorant
that
valter
he
is
going
they
say
to
write
one
history
about
napoleon
i
do
hope
that
in
his
history
he
will
couple
his
thor
and
tzernebock
together
by
my
god
it
would
be
good
diversion
that
walter
scott
appears
to
be
no
particular
favourite
of
yours
said
i
he
is
not
said
the
hungarian
i
hate
him
for
his
slavish
principles
he
wishes
to
see
absolute
power
restored
in
this
country
and
popery
also
and
i
hate
him
because
what
do
you
think
in
one
of
his
novels
published
a
few
months
ago
he
has
the
insolence
to
insult
hungary
in
the
presence
of
one
of
her
sons
he
makes
his
great
braggart
coeur
de
lion
fling
a
magyar
over
his
head
ha
it
was
well
for
richard
that
he
never
felt
the
gripe
of
a
hungarian
i
wish
the
braggart
could
have
felt
the
gripe
of
me
who
am
magyarok
kozt
legkissebb
the
least
among
the
magyars
i
do
hate
that
scott
and
all
his
vile
gang
of
lowlanders
and
highlanders
the
black
corps
the
fekete
regiment
of
matyjas
hunyadi
was
worth
all
the
scots
high
or
low
that
ever
pretended
to
be
soldiers
and
would
have
sent
them
all
headlong
into
the
black
sea
had
they
dared
to
confront
it
on
its
shores
but
why
be
angry
with
an
ignorant
who
couples
together
thor
and
tzernebock
ha
ha
you
have
read
his
novels
said
i
yes
i
read
them
now
and
then
i
do
not
speak
much
english
but
i
can
read
it
well
and
i
have
read
some
of
his
romances
and
mean
to
read
his
in
the
hope
of
finding
thor
and
tzernebock
coupled
together
in
it
as
in
his
come
said
the
jockey
no
more
dutch
whether
high
or
low
i
am
tired
of
it
unless
we
can
have
some
english
i
am
off
to
bed
i
should
be
very
glad
to
hear
some
english
said
i
especially
from
your
mouth
several
things
which
you
have
mentioned
have
awakened
my
curiosity
suppose
you
give
us
your
history
my
history
said
the
jockey
a
rum
idea
however
lest
conversation
should
lag
i
give
it
you
first
of
all
however
a
glass
of
champagne
to
each
after
we
had
each
taken
a
glass
of
champagne
the
jockey
commenced
his
history
chapter
xli
the
jockey
tale
thieves
latin
liberties
with
coin
the
smasher
in
prison
old
fulcher
every
one
has
his
gift
fashion
of
the
english
my
grandfather
was
a
shorter
and
my
father
was
a
smasher
the
one
was
scragg
and
the
other
lagg
i
here
interrupted
the
jockey
by
observing
that
his
discourse
was
for
the
greater
part
unintelligible
to
me
i
do
not
understand
much
english
said
the
hungarian
who
having
replenished
and
resumed
his
mighty
pipe
was
now
smoking
away
but
by
isten
i
believe
it
is
the
gibberish
which
that
great
ignorant
valther
scott
puts
into
the
mouths
of
the
folks
he
calls
gypsies
something
like
it
i
confess
said
i
though
this
sounds
more
genuine
than
his
dialect
which
he
picked
up
out
of
the
canting
vocabulary
at
the
end
of
the
rogue
a
book
which
however
despised
was
written
by
a
remarkable
genius
what
do
you
call
the
speech
you
were
using
said
i
addressing
myself
to
the
jockey
latin
said
the
jockey
very
coolly
that
is
that
dialect
of
it
which
is
used
by
the
gentry
he
is
right
said
the
hungarian
it
is
what
the
germans
call
they
call
it
so
because
there
are
a
great
many
latin
words
in
it
introduced
by
the
priests
who
at
the
time
of
the
reformation
being
too
lazy
to
work
and
too
stupid
to
preach
joined
the
bands
of
thieves
and
robbers
who
prowled
about
the
country
italy
as
you
are
aware
is
called
by
the
germans
welschland
or
the
land
of
the
welschers
and
i
may
add
that
wallachia
derives
its
name
from
a
colony
of
welschers
which
trajan
sent
there
welsch
and
wallack
being
one
and
the
same
word
and
tantamount
to
latin
i
dare
say
you
are
right
said
i
but
why
was
italy
termed
welschland
i
do
not
know
said
the
hungarian
then
i
think
i
can
tell
you
said
i
it
was
called
so
because
the
original
inhabitants
were
a
cimbric
tribe
who
were
called
gwyltiad
that
is
a
race
of
wild
people
living
in
coverts
who
were
of
the
same
blood
and
spoke
the
same
language
as
the
present
inhabitants
of
wales
welsh
seems
merely
a
modification
of
gwyltiad
pray
continue
your
history
said
i
to
the
jockey
only
please
to
do
so
in
a
language
which
we
can
understand
and
first
of
all
interpret
the
sentence
with
which
you
began
it
i
told
you
that
my
grandfather
was
a
shorter
said
the
jockey
by
which
is
meant
a
gentleman
who
shortens
or
reduces
the
current
coin
of
these
realms
for
which
practice
he
was
scragged
that
is
hung
by
the
scrag
of
the
neck
and
when
i
said
that
my
father
was
a
smasher
i
meant
one
who
passes
forged
notes
thereby
doing
his
best
to
smash
the
bank
of
england
by
being
lagged
i
meant
he
was
laid
fast
that
is
had
a
chain
put
round
his
leg
and
then
transported
your
explanations
are
quite
satisfactory
said
i
the
three
first
words
are
metaphorical
and
the
fourth
lagged
is
the
old
genuine
norse
term
lagda
which
signifies
laid
whether
in
durance
or
in
bed
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
what
you
have
told
me
confirms
me
in
an
opinion
which
i
have
long
entertained
that
thieves
latin
is
a
strange
mysterious
speech
formed
of
metaphorical
terms
and
words
derived
from
the
various
ancient
languages
pray
tell
me
now
how
the
gentleman
your
grandfather
contrived
to
shorten
the
coin
of
these
realms
you
shall
hear
said
the
jockey
but
i
have
one
thing
to
beg
of
you
which
is
that
when
i
have
once
begun
my
history
you
will
not
interrupt
me
with
questions
i
do
like
them
they
stops
one
and
puts
one
out
of
one
tale
and
are
not
wanted
for
anything
which
i
think
ca
be
understood
i
should
myself
explain
without
being
asked
my
grandfather
reduced
or
shortened
the
coin
of
this
country
by
three
processes
by
aquafortis
by
clipping
and
by
filing
filing
and
clipping
he
employed
in
reducing
all
sorts
of
coin
whether
gold
or
silver
but
aquafortis
he
used
merely
in
reducing
gold
coin
whether
guineas
jacobuses
or
portugal
pieces
otherwise
called
moidores
which
were
at
one
time
as
current
as
guineas
by
laying
a
guinea
in
aquafortis
for
twelve
hours
he
could
filch
from
it
to
the
value
of
ninepence
and
by
letting
it
remain
there
for
to
the
value
of
eighteenpence
the
aquafortis
eating
the
gold
away
and
leaving
it
like
a
sediment
in
the
vessel
he
was
generally
satisfied
with
taking
the
value
of
ninepence
from
a
guinea
of
eighteenpence
from
a
jacobus
or
moidore
or
from
a
broad
spanish
piece
whether
he
reduced
them
by
aquafortis
filing
or
clipping
from
a
piece
which
is
called
a
bull
in
latin
because
it
is
round
like
a
bull
head
he
would
file
or
clip
to
the
value
of
fivepence
and
from
lesser
coin
in
proportion
he
was
connected
with
a
numerous
gang
or
set
of
people
who
had
given
up
their
minds
and
talents
entirely
to
shortening
here
i
interrupted
the
jockey
how
singular
said
i
is
the
fall
and
debasement
of
words
you
talk
of
a
gang
or
set
of
shorters
you
are
perhaps
not
aware
that
gang
and
set
were
a
thousand
years
ago
only
connected
with
the
great
and
divine
they
are
ancient
norse
words
which
may
be
found
in
the
heroic
poems
of
the
north
and
in
the
edda
a
collection
of
mythologic
and
heroic
songs
in
these
poems
we
read
that
such
and
such
a
king
invaded
norway
with
a
gang
of
heroes
or
so
and
so
for
example
erik
bloodaxe
was
admitted
to
the
set
of
gods
but
at
present
gang
and
set
are
merely
applied
to
the
vilest
of
the
vile
and
the
lowest
of
the
low
we
say
a
gang
of
thieves
and
shorters
or
a
set
of
authors
how
touching
is
this
debasement
of
words
in
the
course
of
time
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
the
decay
of
old
houses
and
names
i
have
known
a
mortimer
who
was
a
hedger
and
ditcher
a
berners
who
was
born
in
a
workhouse
and
a
descendant
of
the
de
burghs
who
bore
the
falcon
mending
old
kettles
and
making
horse
and
pony
shoes
in
a
dingle
odd
enough
said
the
jockey
but
you
were
saying
you
knew
one
berners
man
or
woman
i
would
ask
a
woman
said
i
what
might
her
christian
name
be
said
the
jockey
it
is
not
to
be
mentioned
lightly
said
i
with
a
sigh
i
should
wonder
if
it
were
isopel
said
the
jockey
with
an
arch
glance
of
his
one
brilliant
eye
it
was
isopel
said
i
did
you
know
isopel
berners
ay
and
have
reason
to
know
her
said
the
jockey
putting
his
hand
into
his
left
waistcoat
pocket
as
if
to
feel
for
something
for
she
gave
me
what
i
believe
few
men
could
do
a
most
confounded
whopping
but
now
romany
rye
i
have
again
to
tell
you
that
i
do
like
to
be
interrupted
when
i
speaking
and
to
add
that
if
you
break
in
upon
me
a
third
time
you
and
i
shall
quarrel
pray
proceed
with
your
story
said
i
i
will
not
interrupt
you
again
good
said
the
jockey
where
was
i
oh
with
a
set
of
people
who
had
given
up
their
minds
to
shortening
reducing
the
coin
though
rather
a
lucrative
was
a
very
dangerous
trade
coin
filed
felt
rough
to
the
touch
coin
clipped
could
be
easily
detected
by
the
eye
and
as
for
coin
reduced
by
aquafortis
it
was
generally
so
discoloured
that
unless
a
great
deal
of
pains
was
used
to
polish
it
people
were
apt
to
stare
at
it
in
a
strange
manner
and
to
say
have
they
been
doing
to
this
here
gold
my
grandfather
as
i
have
said
before
was
connected
with
a
gang
of
shorters
and
sometimes
shortened
money
and
at
other
times
passed
off
what
had
been
shortened
by
other
gentry
passing
off
what
had
been
shortened
by
others
was
his
ruin
for
once
in
trying
to
pass
off
a
broad
piece
which
had
been
laid
in
aquafortis
for
hours
and
was
very
black
not
having
been
properly
rectified
he
was
stopped
and
searched
and
other
reduced
coins
being
found
about
him
and
in
his
lodgings
he
was
committed
to
prison
tried
and
executed
he
was
offered
his
life
provided
he
would
betray
his
comrades
but
he
told
the
who
wanted
him
to
do
so
that
he
would
see
them
farther
first
and
died
at
tyburn
amidst
the
cheers
of
the
populace
leaving
my
grandmother
and
father
to
whom
he
had
always
been
a
kind
husband
and
parent
for
setting
aside
the
crime
for
which
he
suffered
he
was
a
moral
man
leaving
them
i
say
to
bewail
his
irreparable
loss
is
said
that
misfortune
never
comes
alone
this
is
however
not
always
the
case
shortly
after
my
grandfather
misfortune
as
my
grandmother
and
her
son
were
living
in
great
misery
in
spitalfields
her
only
relation
a
brother
from
whom
she
had
been
estranged
some
years
on
account
of
her
marriage
with
my
grandfather
who
had
been
in
an
inferior
station
to
herself
died
leaving
all
his
property
to
her
and
the
child
this
property
consisted
of
a
farm
of
about
a
hundred
acres
with
its
stock
and
some
money
besides
my
grandmother
who
knew
something
of
business
instantly
went
into
the
country
where
she
farmed
the
property
for
her
own
benefit
and
that
of
her
son
to
whom
she
gave
an
education
suitable
to
a
person
in
his
condition
till
he
was
old
enough
to
manage
the
farm
himself
shortly
after
the
young
man
came
of
age
my
grandmother
died
and
my
father
in
about
a
year
married
the
daughter
of
a
farmer
from
whom
he
expected
some
little
fortune
but
who
very
much
deceived
him
becoming
a
bankrupt
almost
immediately
after
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
and
himself
and
family
going
into
the
workhouse
my
mother
however
made
my
father
an
excellent
wife
and
if
my
father
in
the
long
run
did
not
do
well
it
was
no
fault
of
hers
my
father
was
not
a
bad
man
by
nature
he
was
of
an
easy
generous
temper
the
most
unfortunate
temper
by
the
bye
for
success
in
this
life
that
any
person
can
be
possessed
of
as
those
who
have
it
are
almost
sure
to
be
made
dupes
of
by
the
designing
but
though
easy
and
generous
he
was
anything
but
a
fool
he
had
a
quick
and
witty
tongue
of
his
own
when
he
chose
to
exert
it
and
woe
be
to
those
who
insulted
him
openly
for
there
was
not
a
better
boxer
in
the
whole
country
round
my
parents
were
married
several
years
before
i
came
into
the
world
who
was
their
first
and
only
child
i
may
be
called
an
unfortunate
creature
i
was
born
with
this
beam
or
scale
on
my
left
eye
which
does
not
allow
me
to
see
with
it
and
though
i
can
see
tolerably
sharply
with
the
other
indeed
more
than
most
people
can
with
both
of
theirs
it
is
a
great
misfortune
not
to
have
two
eyes
like
other
people
moreover
setting
aside
the
affair
of
my
eye
i
had
a
very
ugly
countenance
my
mouth
being
slightly
wrung
aside
and
my
complexion
swarthy
in
fact
i
looked
so
queer
that
the
gossips
and
neighbours
when
they
first
saw
me
swore
i
was
a
changeling
perhaps
it
would
have
been
well
if
i
had
never
been
born
for
my
poor
father
who
had
been
particularly
anxious
to
have
a
son
no
sooner
saw
me
than
he
turned
away
went
to
the
neighbouring
town
and
did
not
return
for
two
days
i
am
by
no
means
certain
that
i
was
not
the
cause
of
his
ruin
for
till
i
came
into
the
world
he
was
fond
of
his
home
and
attended
much
to
business
but
afterwards
he
went
frequently
into
company
and
did
not
seem
to
care
much
about
his
affairs
he
was
however
a
kind
man
and
when
his
wife
gave
him
advice
never
struck
her
nor
do
i
ever
remember
that
he
kicked
me
when
i
came
in
his
way
or
so
much
as
cursed
my
ugly
face
though
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
me
when
i
was
six
years
old
i
was
sent
to
the
where
i
was
soon
booked
for
a
dunce
because
the
master
found
it
impossible
to
teach
me
either
to
read
or
write
before
i
had
been
at
school
two
years
however
i
had
beaten
boys
four
years
older
than
myself
and
could
fling
a
stone
with
my
left
hand
for
if
i
am
i
am
higher
and
farther
than
any
one
in
the
parish
moreover
no
boy
could
equal
me
at
riding
and
no
people
ride
so
well
or
desperately
as
boys
i
could
ride
a
donkey
a
thing
far
more
difficult
to
ride
than
a
horse
at
full
gallop
over
hedges
and
ditches
seated
or
rather
floating
upon
his
hinder
part
so
though
anything
but
clever
as
this
here
romany
rye
would
say
i
was
yet
able
to
do
things
which
few
other
people
could
do
by
the
time
i
was
ten
my
father
affairs
had
got
into
a
very
desperate
condition
for
he
had
taken
to
gambling
and
racing
and
being
unsuccessful
had
sold
his
stock
mortgaged
his
estate
and
incurred
very
serious
debts
the
upshot
was
that
within
a
little
time
all
he
had
was
seized
himself
imprisoned
and
my
mother
and
myself
put
into
a
cottage
belonging
to
the
parish
which
being
very
cold
and
damp
was
the
cause
of
her
catching
a
fever
which
speedily
carried
her
off
i
was
then
bound
apprentice
to
a
farmer
in
whose
service
i
underwent
much
coarse
treatment
cold
and
hunger
after
lying
in
prison
near
two
years
my
father
was
liberated
by
an
act
for
the
benefit
of
insolvent
debtors
he
was
then
lost
sight
of
for
some
time
at
last
however
he
made
his
appearance
in
the
neighbourhood
dressed
like
a
gentleman
and
seemingly
possessed
of
plenty
of
money
he
came
to
see
me
took
me
into
a
field
and
asked
me
how
i
was
getting
on
i
told
him
i
was
dreadfully
used
and
begged
him
to
take
me
away
with
him
he
refused
and
told
me
to
be
satisfied
with
my
condition
for
that
he
could
do
nothing
for
me
i
had
a
great
love
for
my
father
and
likewise
a
great
admiration
for
him
on
account
of
his
character
as
a
boxer
the
only
character
which
boys
in
general
regard
so
i
wished
much
to
be
with
him
independently
of
the
dog
life
i
was
leading
where
i
was
i
therefore
said
if
he
would
not
take
me
with
him
i
would
follow
him
he
replied
that
i
must
do
no
such
thing
for
that
if
i
did
it
would
be
my
ruin
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
but
he
made
no
reply
only
saying
that
he
would
go
and
speak
to
the
farmer
then
taking
me
with
him
he
went
to
the
farmer
and
in
a
very
civil
manner
said
that
he
understood
i
had
not
been
very
kindly
treated
by
him
but
he
hoped
that
in
future
i
should
be
used
better
the
farmer
answered
in
a
surly
tone
that
i
had
been
only
too
well
treated
for
that
i
was
a
worthless
young
scoundrel
high
words
ensued
and
the
farmer
forgetting
the
kind
of
man
he
had
to
deal
with
checked
him
with
my
grandsire
misfortune
and
said
he
deserved
to
be
hanged
like
his
father
in
a
moment
my
father
knocked
him
down
and
on
his
getting
up
gave
him
a
terrible
beating
then
taking
me
by
the
hand
he
hastened
away
as
we
were
going
down
a
lane
he
said
we
were
now
both
done
for
do
care
a
straw
for
that
father
said
i
i
be
with
you
my
father
took
me
to
the
neighbouring
town
and
going
into
the
yard
of
a
small
inn
he
ordered
out
a
pony
and
light
cart
which
belonged
to
him
then
paying
his
bill
he
told
me
to
mount
upon
the
seat
and
getting
up
drove
away
like
lightning
we
drove
for
at
least
six
hours
without
stopping
till
we
came
to
a
cottage
by
the
side
of
a
heath
we
put
the
pony
and
cart
into
a
shed
and
went
into
the
cottage
my
father
unlocking
the
door
with
a
key
which
he
took
out
of
his
pocket
there
was
nobody
in
the
cottage
when
we
arrived
but
shortly
after
there
came
a
man
and
a
woman
and
then
some
more
people
and
by
ten
at
night
there
were
a
dozen
of
us
in
the
cottage
the
people
were
companions
of
my
father
my
father
began
talking
to
them
in
latin
but
i
did
not
understand
much
of
the
discourse
though
i
believe
it
was
about
myself
as
their
eyes
were
frequently
turned
to
me
some
objections
appeared
to
be
made
to
what
he
said
however
all
at
last
seemed
to
be
settled
and
we
all
sat
down
to
some
food
after
that
all
the
people
got
up
and
went
away
with
the
exception
of
the
woman
who
remained
with
my
father
and
me
the
next
day
my
father
also
departed
leaving
me
with
the
woman
telling
me
before
he
went
that
she
would
teach
me
some
things
which
it
behoved
me
to
know
i
remained
with
her
in
the
cottage
upwards
of
a
week
several
of
those
who
had
been
there
coming
and
going
the
woman
after
making
me
take
an
oath
to
be
faithful
told
me
that
the
people
whom
i
had
seen
were
a
gang
who
got
their
livelihood
by
passing
forged
notes
and
that
my
father
was
a
principal
man
amongst
them
adding
that
i
must
do
my
best
to
assist
them
i
was
a
poor
ignorant
child
at
that
time
and
i
made
no
objection
thinking
that
whatever
my
father
did
must
be
right
the
woman
then
gave
me
some
instructions
in
the
smasher
dialect
of
the
latin
language
i
made
great
progress
because
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
paid
great
attention
to
my
lessons
at
last
my
father
returned
and
after
some
conversation
with
the
woman
took
me
away
in
his
cart
i
shall
be
very
short
about
what
happened
to
my
father
and
myself
during
two
years
my
father
did
his
best
to
smash
the
bank
of
england
by
passing
forged
notes
and
i
did
my
best
to
assist
him
we
attended
races
and
fairs
in
all
kinds
of
disguises
my
father
was
a
hand
at
a
disguise
and
could
appear
of
all
ages
from
twenty
to
fourscore
he
was
however
grabbed
at
last
he
had
said
as
i
have
told
you
that
he
should
be
my
ruin
but
i
was
the
cause
of
his
and
all
owing
to
the
misfortune
of
this
here
eye
of
mine
we
came
to
this
very
place
of
horncastle
where
my
father
purchased
two
horses
of
a
young
man
paying
for
them
with
three
forged
notes
purporting
to
be
bank
of
englanders
of
fifty
pounds
each
and
got
the
young
man
to
change
another
of
the
like
amount
he
at
that
time
appeared
as
a
respectable
dealer
and
i
as
his
son
as
i
really
was
as
soon
as
we
had
got
the
horses
we
conveyed
them
to
one
of
the
places
of
call
belonging
to
our
gang
of
which
there
were
several
there
they
were
delivered
into
the
hands
of
our
companions
who
speedily
sold
them
in
a
distant
part
of
the
country
the
sum
which
they
fetched
for
the
gang
kept
very
regular
accounts
formed
an
important
item
on
the
next
day
of
sharing
of
which
there
were
twelve
in
the
year
the
young
man
whom
my
father
had
paid
for
the
horses
with
his
smashing
notes
was
soon
in
trouble
about
them
and
ran
some
risk
as
i
heard
of
being
executed
but
he
bore
a
good
character
told
a
plain
story
and
above
all
had
friends
and
was
admitted
to
bail
to
one
of
his
friends
he
described
my
father
and
myself
this
person
happened
to
be
at
an
inn
in
yorkshire
where
my
father
disguised
as
a
quaker
attempted
to
pass
a
forged
note
the
note
was
shown
to
this
individual
who
pronounced
it
a
forgery
it
being
exactly
similar
to
those
for
which
the
young
man
had
been
in
trouble
and
which
he
had
seen
my
father
however
being
supposed
a
respectable
man
because
he
was
dressed
as
a
quaker
the
very
reason
by
the
bye
why
anybody
who
knew
aught
of
the
quakers
would
have
suspected
him
to
be
a
rogue
would
have
been
let
go
had
i
not
made
my
appearance
dressed
as
his
footboy
the
friend
of
the
young
man
looked
at
my
eye
and
seized
hold
of
my
father
who
made
a
desperate
resistance
i
assisting
him
as
in
duty
bound
being
however
overpowered
by
numbers
he
bade
me
by
a
look
and
a
word
or
two
in
latin
to
make
myself
scarce
though
my
heart
was
fit
to
break
i
obeyed
my
father
who
was
speedily
committed
i
followed
him
to
the
county
town
in
which
he
was
lodged
where
shortly
after
i
saw
him
tried
convicted
and
condemned
i
then
having
made
friends
with
the
jailor
wife
visited
him
in
his
cell
where
i
found
him
very
much
cast
down
he
said
that
my
mother
had
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream
and
talked
to
him
about
a
resurrection
and
christ
jesus
there
was
a
bible
before
him
and
he
told
me
the
chaplain
had
just
been
praying
with
him
he
reproached
himself
much
saying
he
was
afraid
he
had
been
my
ruin
by
teaching
me
bad
habits
i
told
him
not
to
say
any
such
thing
for
that
i
had
been
the
cause
of
his
owing
to
the
misfortune
of
my
eye
he
begged
me
to
give
over
all
unlawful
pursuits
saying
that
if
persisted
in
they
were
sure
of
bringing
a
person
to
destruction
i
advised
him
to
try
and
make
his
escape
proposing
that
when
the
turnkey
came
to
let
me
out
he
should
knock
him
down
and
fight
his
way
out
offering
to
assist
him
showing
him
a
small
saw
with
which
one
of
our
companions
who
was
in
the
neighbourhood
had
provided
me
and
with
which
he
could
have
cut
through
his
fetters
in
five
minutes
but
he
told
me
he
had
no
wish
to
escape
and
was
quite
willing
to
die
i
was
rather
hard
at
that
time
i
am
not
very
soft
now
and
i
felt
rather
ashamed
of
my
father
want
of
what
i
called
spirit
he
was
not
executed
after
all
for
the
chaplain
who
was
connected
with
a
great
family
stood
his
friend
and
got
his
sentence
commuted
as
they
call
it
to
transportation
and
in
order
to
make
the
matter
easy
he
induced
my
father
to
make
some
valuable
disclosures
with
respect
to
the
system
i
confess
that
i
would
have
been
hanged
before
i
would
have
done
so
after
having
reaped
the
profit
of
it
that
is
i
think
so
now
seated
comfortably
in
my
inn
with
my
bottle
of
champagne
before
me
he
however
did
not
show
himself
carrion
he
would
not
betray
his
companions
who
had
behaved
very
handsomely
to
him
having
given
the
son
of
a
lord
a
great
barrister
not
a
forged
bill
but
a
hundred
hard
guineas
to
plead
his
cause
and
another
ten
to
induce
him
after
pleading
to
put
his
hand
to
his
breast
and
say
that
upon
his
honour
he
believed
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
to
be
an
honest
and
injured
man
no
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
say
that
my
father
did
not
show
himself
exactly
carrion
though
i
could
almost
have
wished
he
had
let
himself
however
i
am
here
with
my
bottle
of
champagne
and
the
romany
rye
and
he
was
in
his
cell
with
bread
and
water
and
the
prison
chaplain
he
took
an
affectionate
leave
of
me
before
he
was
sent
away
giving
me
three
out
of
five
guineas
all
the
money
he
had
left
he
was
a
kind
man
but
not
exactly
fitted
to
fill
my
grandfather
shoes
i
afterwards
learned
that
he
died
of
fever
as
he
was
being
carried
across
the
sea
during
the
i
had
made
acquaintance
with
old
fulcher
i
was
in
the
town
on
my
father
account
and
he
was
there
on
his
son
who
having
committed
a
small
larceny
was
in
trouble
young
fulcher
however
unlike
my
father
got
off
though
he
did
not
give
the
son
of
a
lord
a
hundred
guineas
to
speak
for
him
and
ten
more
to
pledge
his
sacred
honour
for
his
honesty
but
gave
counsellor
p
shillings
to
defend
him
who
so
frightened
the
principal
evidence
a
plain
honest
that
he
flatly
contradicted
what
he
had
first
said
and
at
last
acknowledged
himself
to
be
all
the
rogues
in
the
world
and
amongst
other
things
a
perjured
villain
old
fulcher
before
he
left
the
town
with
his
son
and
here
it
will
be
well
to
say
that
he
and
his
son
left
it
in
a
kind
of
triumph
the
base
drummer
of
a
militia
regiment
to
whom
they
had
given
beating
his
drum
before
them
old
fulcher
i
say
asked
me
to
go
and
visit
him
telling
me
where
at
such
a
time
i
might
find
him
and
his
caravan
and
family
offering
if
i
thought
fit
to
teach
me
so
after
my
father
had
been
sent
off
i
went
and
found
up
old
fulcher
and
became
his
apprentice
in
the
line
i
stayed
with
him
till
the
time
of
his
death
which
happened
in
about
three
months
travelling
about
with
him
and
his
family
and
living
in
green
lanes
where
we
saw
gypsies
and
trampers
and
all
kinds
of
strange
characters
old
fulcher
besides
being
an
industrious
was
an
thief
as
was
also
his
son
and
indeed
every
member
of
his
family
they
used
to
make
baskets
during
the
day
and
thieve
during
a
great
part
of
the
night
i
had
not
been
with
them
twelve
hours
before
old
fulcher
told
me
that
i
must
thieve
as
well
as
the
rest
i
demurred
at
first
for
i
remembered
the
fate
of
my
father
and
what
he
had
told
me
about
leaving
off
bad
courses
but
soon
allowed
myself
to
be
more
especially
as
the
first
robbery
i
was
asked
to
do
was
a
fruit
robbery
i
was
to
go
with
young
fulcher
and
steal
some
fine
morell
cherries
which
grew
against
a
wall
in
a
gentleman
garden
so
young
fulcher
and
i
went
and
stole
the
cherries
one
half
of
which
we
ate
and
gave
the
rest
to
the
old
man
who
sold
them
to
a
fruiterer
ten
miles
off
from
the
place
where
we
had
stolen
them
the
next
night
old
fulcher
took
me
out
with
himself
he
was
a
great
thief
though
in
a
small
way
he
used
to
say
that
they
were
fools
who
did
not
always
manage
to
keep
the
rope
below
their
shoulders
by
which
he
meant
that
it
was
not
advisable
to
commit
a
robbery
or
do
anything
which
could
bring
you
to
the
gallows
he
was
all
for
petty
larceny
and
knew
where
to
put
his
hand
upon
any
little
thing
in
england
which
it
was
possible
to
steal
i
submit
it
to
the
better
judgment
of
the
romany
rye
who
i
see
is
a
great
hand
for
words
and
names
whether
he
ought
not
to
have
been
called
old
filcher
instead
of
fulcher
i
give
a
regular
account
of
the
larcenies
he
committed
during
the
short
time
i
knew
him
either
alone
by
himself
or
with
me
and
his
son
i
shall
merely
relate
the
last
a
melancholy
gentleman
who
lived
a
very
solitary
life
had
a
large
carp
in
a
shady
pond
in
a
meadow
close
to
his
house
he
was
exceedingly
fond
of
it
and
used
to
feed
it
with
his
own
hand
the
creature
being
so
tame
that
it
would
put
its
snout
out
of
the
water
to
be
fed
when
it
was
whistled
to
feeding
and
looking
at
his
carp
were
the
only
pleasures
the
poor
melancholy
gentleman
possessed
old
fulcher
being
in
the
neighbourhood
and
having
an
order
from
a
fishmonger
for
a
large
fish
which
was
wanted
at
a
great
city
dinner
at
which
his
majesty
was
to
be
present
swore
he
would
steal
the
carp
and
asked
me
to
go
with
him
i
had
heard
of
the
gentleman
fondness
for
his
creature
and
begged
him
to
let
it
be
advising
him
to
go
and
steal
some
other
fish
but
old
fulcher
swore
and
said
he
would
have
the
carp
although
its
master
should
hang
himself
i
told
him
he
might
go
by
himself
but
he
took
his
son
and
stole
the
carp
which
weighed
seventeen
pounds
old
fulcher
got
thirty
shillings
for
the
carp
which
i
afterwards
heard
was
much
admired
and
relished
by
his
majesty
the
master
however
of
the
carp
on
losing
his
favourite
became
more
melancholy
than
ever
and
in
a
little
time
hanged
himself
sport
for
one
is
death
to
another
i
once
heard
at
the
read
out
of
a
this
was
the
last
larceny
old
fulcher
ever
committed
he
could
keep
his
neck
always
out
of
the
noose
but
he
could
not
always
keep
his
leg
out
of
the
trap
a
few
nights
after
having
removed
to
a
distance
he
went
to
an
osier
car
in
order
to
steal
some
osiers
for
his
for
he
never
bought
any
i
followed
a
little
way
behind
old
fulcher
had
frequently
stolen
osiers
out
of
the
car
whilst
in
the
neighbourhood
but
during
his
absence
the
property
of
which
the
car
was
a
part
had
been
let
to
a
young
gentleman
a
great
hand
for
preserving
game
old
fulcher
had
not
got
far
into
the
car
before
he
put
his
foot
into
a
hearing
old
fulcher
shriek
i
ran
up
and
found
him
in
a
dreadful
condition
putting
a
large
stick
which
i
carried
into
the
jaws
of
the
trap
i
contrived
to
prize
them
open
and
get
old
fulcher
leg
out
but
the
leg
was
broken
so
i
ran
to
the
caravan
and
told
young
fulcher
of
what
had
happened
and
he
and
i
helped
his
father
home
a
doctor
was
sent
for
who
said
that
it
was
necessary
to
take
the
leg
off
but
old
fulcher
being
very
much
afraid
of
pain
said
it
should
not
be
taken
off
and
the
doctor
went
away
but
after
some
days
old
fulcher
becoming
worse
ordered
the
doctor
to
be
sent
for
who
came
and
took
off
his
leg
but
it
was
then
too
late
mortification
had
come
on
and
in
a
little
time
old
fulcher
died
thus
perished
old
fulcher
he
was
succeeded
in
his
business
by
his
son
young
fulcher
who
immediately
after
the
death
of
his
father
was
called
old
fulcher
it
being
our
english
custom
to
call
everybody
old
as
soon
as
their
fathers
are
buried
young
fulcher
i
mean
he
who
had
been
called
young
but
was
now
old
fulcher
wanted
me
to
go
out
and
commit
larcenies
with
him
but
i
told
him
that
i
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
thieving
having
seen
the
ill
effects
of
it
and
that
i
should
leave
them
in
the
morning
old
fulcher
begged
me
to
think
better
of
it
and
his
mother
joined
with
him
they
offered
if
i
would
stay
to
give
me
mary
fulcher
as
a
mort
till
she
and
i
were
old
enough
to
be
regularly
married
she
being
the
daughter
of
the
one
and
the
sister
of
the
other
i
liked
the
girl
very
well
for
she
had
always
been
civil
to
me
and
had
a
fair
complexion
and
nice
red
hair
both
of
which
i
like
being
a
bit
of
a
black
myself
but
i
refused
being
determined
to
see
something
more
of
the
world
than
i
could
hope
to
do
with
the
fulchers
and
moreover
to
live
honestly
which
i
could
never
do
along
with
them
so
the
next
morning
i
left
them
i
was
as
i
said
before
quite
determined
upon
an
honest
livelihood
and
i
soon
found
one
he
is
a
great
fool
who
is
ever
dishonest
in
england
any
person
who
has
any
natural
gift
and
everybody
has
some
natural
gift
is
sure
of
finding
encouragement
in
this
noble
country
of
ours
provided
he
will
but
exhibit
it
i
had
not
walked
more
than
three
miles
before
i
came
to
a
wonderfully
high
church
steeple
which
stood
close
by
the
road
i
looked
at
the
steeple
and
going
to
a
heap
of
smooth
pebbles
which
lay
by
the
roadside
i
took
up
some
and
then
went
into
the
churchyard
and
placing
myself
just
below
the
tower
my
right
foot
resting
on
a
ledge
about
two
foot
from
the
ground
i
with
my
left
hand
being
a
person
do
you
see
flung
or
chucked
up
a
stone
which
lighting
on
the
top
of
the
steeple
which
was
at
least
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
high
did
there
remain
after
repeating
this
feat
two
or
three
times
i
up
a
stone
which
went
clean
over
the
tower
and
then
one
my
right
foot
still
on
the
ledge
which
rising
at
least
five
yards
above
the
steeple
did
fall
down
just
at
my
feet
without
knowing
it
i
was
showing
off
my
gift
to
others
besides
myself
doing
what
perhaps
not
five
men
in
england
could
do
two
men
who
were
passing
by
stopped
and
looked
at
my
proceedings
and
when
i
had
done
flinging
came
into
the
churchyard
and
after
paying
me
a
compliment
on
what
they
had
seen
me
do
proposed
that
i
should
join
company
with
them
i
asked
them
who
they
were
and
they
told
me
the
one
was
hopping
ned
and
the
other
biting
giles
both
had
their
gifts
by
which
they
got
their
livelihood
ned
could
hop
a
hundred
yards
with
any
man
in
england
and
giles
could
lift
up
with
his
teeth
any
dresser
or
in
the
country
and
standing
erect
hold
it
dangling
in
his
jaws
many
a
big
oak
table
and
dresser
in
certain
districts
of
england
which
bear
the
marks
of
giles
teeth
and
i
make
no
doubt
that
a
hundred
or
two
years
hence
there
be
strange
stories
about
those
marks
and
that
people
will
point
them
out
as
a
proof
that
there
were
giants
in
bygone
time
and
that
many
a
dentist
will
moralize
on
the
decays
which
human
teeth
have
undergone
they
wanted
me
to
go
about
with
them
and
exhibit
my
gift
occasionally
as
they
did
theirs
promising
that
the
money
that
was
got
by
the
exhibitions
should
be
honestly
divided
i
consented
and
we
set
off
together
and
that
evening
coming
to
a
village
and
putting
up
at
the
house
all
the
grand
folks
of
the
village
being
there
smoking
their
pipes
we
contrived
to
introduce
the
subject
of
hopping
the
upshot
being
that
ned
hopped
against
the
for
a
pound
and
beat
him
hollow
shortly
after
giles
for
a
wager
took
up
the
kitchen
table
in
his
jaws
though
he
had
to
pay
a
shilling
to
the
landlady
for
the
marks
he
left
whose
grandchildren
will
perhaps
get
money
by
exhibiting
them
as
for
myself
i
did
nothing
that
day
but
the
next
on
which
my
companions
did
nothing
i
showed
off
at
hulling
stones
against
a
cripple
the
crack
man
for
of
a
small
town
a
few
miles
farther
on
bets
were
made
to
the
tune
of
some
pounds
i
contrived
to
beat
the
cripple
and
just
contrived
for
to
do
him
justice
i
must
acknowledge
he
was
a
hand
at
stones
though
he
had
a
game
hip
and
went
sideways
his
head
when
he
walked
if
his
movements
could
be
called
walking
not
being
above
three
feet
above
the
ground
so
we
travelled
i
and
my
companions
showing
off
our
gifts
giles
and
i
occasionally
for
a
gathering
but
ned
never
hopping
unless
against
somebody
for
a
wager
we
lived
honestly
and
comfortably
making
no
little
money
by
our
natural
endowments
and
were
known
over
a
great
part
of
england
as
ned
giles
and
over
the
head
jack
which
was
my
name
it
being
the
blackguard
fashion
of
the
english
do
you
see
to
here
i
interrupted
the
jockey
you
may
call
it
a
blackguard
fashion
said
i
and
i
dare
say
it
is
or
it
would
scarcely
be
english
but
it
is
an
immensely
ancient
one
and
is
handed
down
to
us
from
our
northern
ancestry
especially
the
danes
who
were
in
the
habit
of
giving
people
surnames
or
rather
nicknames
from
some
quality
of
body
or
mind
but
generally
from
some
disadvantageous
peculiarity
of
feature
for
there
is
no
denying
that
the
english
norse
or
whatever
we
may
please
to
call
them
are
an
envious
depreciatory
set
of
people
who
not
only
give
their
poor
comrades
contemptuous
names
but
their
great
people
also
they
did
call
you
the
matchless
hurler
because
by
doing
so
they
would
have
paid
you
a
compliment
but
hull
over
the
head
jack
as
much
as
to
say
that
after
all
you
were
a
scrub
so
in
ancient
time
instead
of
calling
regner
the
great
conqueror
the
nation
tamer
they
surnamed
him
lodbrog
which
signifies
rough
or
hairy
breeks
lod
or
loddin
signifying
rough
or
hairy
and
instead
of
complimenting
halgerdr
the
wife
of
gunnar
of
hlitharend
the
great
champion
of
iceland
upon
her
majestic
presence
by
calling
her
halgerdr
the
stately
or
tall
what
must
they
do
but
term
her
or
highbreeks
it
being
the
fashion
in
old
times
for
northern
ladies
to
wear
breeks
or
breeches
which
english
ladies
of
the
present
day
never
think
of
doing
and
just
as
of
old
they
called
halgerdr
so
this
very
day
a
fellow
of
horncastle
called
in
my
hearing
our
hungarian
friend
here
oh
i
could
give
you
a
hundred
instances
both
ancient
and
modern
of
this
unseemly
propensity
of
our
illustrious
race
though
i
will
only
trouble
you
with
a
few
more
ancient
ones
they
not
only
nicknamed
regner
but
his
sons
also
who
were
all
kings
and
distinguished
men
one
whose
name
was
biorn
they
nicknamed
ironsides
another
sigurd
snake
in
the
eye
another
white
sark
or
white
shirt
i
wonder
they
did
not
call
him
dirty
shirt
and
ivarr
another
who
was
king
of
northumberland
they
called
bienlausi
or
the
legless
because
he
was
had
no
sap
in
his
bones
and
consequently
no
children
he
was
a
great
king
it
is
true
and
very
wise
nevertheless
his
blackguard
countrymen
always
averse
as
their
descendants
are
to
give
credit
to
anybody
for
any
valuable
quality
or
possession
must
needs
lay
hold
do
you
see
but
before
i
could
say
any
more
the
jockey
having
laid
down
his
pipe
rose
and
having
taken
off
his
coat
advanced
towards
me
chapter
xlii
a
person
gravitation
the
best
endowment
mary
fulcher
fair
dealing
darius
and
his
groom
the
tricks
the
two
characters
the
jockey
song
the
jockey
having
taken
off
his
coat
and
advanced
towards
me
as
i
have
stated
in
the
preceding
chapter
exclaimed
in
an
angry
tone
this
is
the
third
time
you
have
interrupted
me
in
my
tale
rye
i
passed
over
the
two
first
times
with
a
simple
warning
but
you
will
now
please
to
get
up
and
give
me
the
satisfaction
of
a
man
i
am
really
sorry
said
i
if
i
have
given
you
offence
but
you
were
talking
of
our
english
habits
of
bestowing
nicknames
and
i
could
not
refrain
from
giving
a
few
examples
tending
to
prove
what
a
very
ancient
habit
it
is
but
you
interrupted
me
said
the
jockey
and
put
me
out
of
my
tale
which
you
had
no
right
to
do
and
as
for
your
examples
how
do
you
know
that
i
was
going
to
give
some
as
old
or
older
than
yourn
now
stand
up
and
i
make
an
example
of
you
well
said
i
i
confess
it
was
wrong
in
me
to
interrupt
you
and
i
ask
your
pardon
that
wo
do
said
the
jockey
asking
pardon
wo
do
oh
said
i
getting
up
if
asking
pardon
does
not
satisfy
you
you
are
a
different
man
from
what
i
considered
you
but
here
the
hungarian
also
getting
up
interposed
his
tall
form
and
pipe
between
us
saying
in
english
scarcely
intelligible
let
there
be
no
dispute
as
for
myself
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
the
young
man
of
horncastle
for
his
interruption
though
he
has
told
me
that
one
of
his
dirty
townsmen
called
me
by
isten
there
is
more
learning
in
what
he
has
just
said
than
in
all
the
verdammt
english
histories
of
thor
and
tzernebock
i
ever
read
i
care
nothing
for
his
learning
said
the
jockey
i
consider
myself
as
good
a
man
as
he
for
all
his
learning
so
stand
out
of
the
way
sixfooteleven
or
i
shall
do
no
such
thing
said
the
hungarian
i
wonder
you
are
not
ashamed
of
yourself
you
ask
a
young
man
to
drink
champagne
with
you
you
make
him
dronk
he
interrupt
you
with
very
good
sense
he
ask
your
pardon
yet
you
not
well
said
the
jockey
i
am
satisfied
i
am
rather
a
person
but
i
bear
no
malice
he
is
as
you
say
drinking
my
wine
and
has
perhaps
taken
a
drop
too
much
not
being
used
to
such
high
liquor
but
one
does
like
to
be
put
out
of
one
tale
more
especially
when
one
was
about
to
moralize
do
you
see
oneself
and
to
show
off
what
little
learning
one
has
however
i
bears
no
malice
here
is
a
hand
to
each
of
you
we
take
another
glass
each
and
think
no
more
about
it
the
jockey
having
shaken
both
of
our
hands
and
filled
our
glasses
and
his
own
with
what
champagne
remained
in
the
bottle
put
on
his
coat
sat
down
and
resumed
his
pipe
and
story
where
was
i
oh
roaming
about
the
country
with
hopping
ned
and
biting
giles
those
were
happy
days
and
a
merry
and
prosperous
life
we
led
however
nothing
continues
under
the
sun
in
the
same
state
in
which
it
begins
and
our
firm
was
soon
destined
to
undergo
a
change
we
came
to
a
village
where
there
was
a
very
high
church
steeple
and
in
a
little
time
my
comrades
induced
a
crowd
of
people
to
go
and
see
me
display
my
gift
by
flinging
stones
above
the
heads
of
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
who
stood
at
the
four
corners
on
the
top
carved
in
stone
the
parson
seeing
the
crowd
came
waddling
out
of
his
rectory
to
see
what
was
going
on
after
i
had
flung
up
the
stones
letting
them
fall
just
where
i
liked
and
one
i
remember
fell
on
the
head
of
mark
where
i
dare
say
it
remains
to
the
present
day
the
parson
who
was
one
of
the
description
of
people
called
philosophers
held
up
his
hand
and
asked
me
to
let
the
next
stone
i
flung
up
fall
upon
it
he
wished
do
you
see
to
know
with
what
weight
the
stone
would
fall
down
and
talked
something
about
gravitation
a
word
which
i
could
never
understand
to
the
present
day
save
that
it
turned
out
a
grave
matter
to
me
i
like
a
silly
fellow
myself
must
needs
consent
and
flinging
the
stone
up
to
a
vast
height
contrived
so
that
it
fell
into
the
parson
hand
which
it
cut
dreadfully
the
parson
flew
into
a
great
rage
more
particularly
as
everybody
laughed
at
him
and
being
a
magistrate
ordered
his
clerk
who
was
likewise
constable
to
conduct
me
to
prison
as
a
rogue
and
vagabond
telling
my
comrades
that
if
they
did
not
take
themselves
off
he
would
serve
them
in
the
same
manner
so
ned
hopped
off
and
giles
ran
after
him
without
making
any
gathering
and
i
was
led
to
bridewell
my
mittimus
following
at
the
end
of
a
week
the
parson
hand
not
permitting
him
to
write
before
that
time
in
the
bridewell
i
remained
a
month
when
being
dismissed
i
went
in
quest
of
my
companions
whom
after
some
time
i
found
up
but
they
refused
to
keep
my
company
any
longer
telling
me
that
i
was
a
dangerous
character
likely
to
bring
them
more
trouble
than
profit
they
had
moreover
filled
up
my
place
going
into
a
cottage
to
ask
for
a
drink
of
water
they
saw
a
country
fellow
making
faces
to
amuse
his
children
the
faces
were
so
wonderful
that
hopping
ned
and
biting
giles
at
once
proposed
taking
him
into
partnership
and
the
man
who
was
a
fellow
not
very
fond
of
work
after
a
little
entreaty
went
away
with
them
i
saw
him
exhibit
his
gift
and
could
blame
the
others
for
preferring
him
to
me
he
was
a
proper
ugly
fellow
at
all
times
but
when
he
made
faces
his
countenance
was
like
nothing
human
he
was
called
ugly
moses
i
was
so
amazed
at
his
faces
that
though
poor
myself
i
gave
him
sixpence
which
i
have
never
grudged
to
this
day
for
i
never
saw
anything
like
them
the
firm
throve
wonderfully
after
he
had
been
admitted
into
it
he
died
some
little
time
ago
keeper
of
a
house
which
he
had
been
enabled
to
take
from
the
profits
of
his
faces
a
son
of
his
one
of
the
children
he
was
making
faces
to
when
my
comrades
entered
his
door
is
at
present
a
barrister
and
a
very
rising
one
he
has
his
gift
he
has
not
it
is
true
the
gift
of
the
gab
but
he
has
something
better
he
was
born
with
a
grin
on
his
face
a
quiet
grin
he
would
not
have
done
to
grin
through
a
collar
like
his
father
and
would
never
have
been
taken
up
by
hopping
ned
and
biting
giles
but
that
grin
of
his
caused
him
to
be
noticed
by
a
much
greater
person
than
either
an
attorney
observing
it
took
a
liking
to
the
lad
and
prophesied
that
he
would
some
day
be
heard
of
in
the
world
and
in
order
to
give
him
the
first
lift
took
him
into
his
office
at
first
to
light
fires
and
do
such
kind
of
work
and
after
a
little
time
taught
him
to
write
then
promoted
him
to
a
desk
articled
him
afterwards
and
being
unmarried
and
without
children
left
him
what
he
had
when
he
died
the
young
fellow
after
practising
at
the
law
some
time
went
to
the
bar
where
in
a
few
years
helped
on
by
his
grin
for
he
had
nothing
else
to
recommend
him
he
became
as
i
said
before
a
rising
barrister
he
comes
our
circuit
and
i
occasionally
employ
him
when
i
am
obliged
to
go
to
law
about
such
a
thing
as
an
unsound
horse
he
generally
brings
me
through
or
rather
that
grin
of
his
does
and
yet
i
do
like
the
fellow
confound
him
but
i
an
oddity
no
the
one
i
like
and
whom
i
generally
employ
is
a
fellow
quite
different
a
bluff
sturdy
dog
with
no
grin
on
his
face
but
with
a
look
that
seems
to
say
i
am
an
honest
man
and
what
cares
i
for
any
one
and
an
honest
man
he
is
and
something
more
i
have
known
coves
with
a
better
gift
of
the
gab
though
not
many
but
he
always
speaks
to
the
purpose
and
understands
law
thoroughly
and
that
not
all
when
at
college
for
he
has
been
at
college
he
carried
off
everything
before
him
as
a
latiner
and
was
at
a
game
they
call
matthew
mattocks
i
do
exactly
know
what
it
is
but
i
have
heard
that
he
who
is
at
matthew
mattocks
is
thought
more
of
than
if
he
were
latiner
well
the
chap
that
i
talking
about
not
only
came
out
latiner
but
at
matthew
mattocks
too
doing
in
fact
as
i
am
told
by
those
who
knows
for
i
was
never
at
college
myself
what
no
one
had
ever
done
before
well
he
makes
his
appearance
at
our
circuit
does
very
well
of
course
but
he
has
a
somewhat
high
front
as
becomes
an
honest
man
and
one
who
has
beat
every
one
at
latin
and
matthew
mattocks
and
one
who
can
speak
law
and
sense
but
see
now
the
cove
with
the
grin
who
has
like
myself
never
been
at
college
knows
nothing
of
latin
or
matthew
mattocks
and
has
no
particular
gift
of
the
gab
has
two
briefs
for
his
one
and
i
suppose
very
properly
for
that
grin
of
his
curries
favour
with
the
juries
and
mark
me
that
grin
of
his
will
enable
him
to
beat
the
other
in
the
long
run
we
all
know
what
all
barrister
coves
looks
forward
to
a
seat
on
the
hop
sack
well
i
bet
a
bull
to
fivepence
that
the
grinner
gets
upon
it
and
the
snarler
does
at
any
rate
that
he
gets
there
first
i
calls
my
cove
for
he
is
my
cove
a
snarler
because
your
at
matthew
mattocks
are
called
snarlers
and
for
no
other
reason
for
the
chap
though
with
a
high
front
is
a
good
chap
and
once
drank
a
glass
of
ale
with
me
after
buying
an
animal
out
of
my
stable
i
have
often
thought
it
a
pity
he
was
born
with
a
grin
on
his
face
like
the
son
of
ugly
it
is
true
he
would
scarcely
then
have
been
an
out
and
outer
at
latin
and
matthew
mattocks
but
what
need
of
either
to
a
chap
born
with
a
grin
talk
of
being
born
with
a
silver
spoon
in
one
mouth
give
me
a
cove
born
with
a
grin
on
his
face
a
much
better
endowment
i
will
now
shorten
my
history
as
much
as
i
can
for
we
have
talked
as
much
as
folks
do
during
a
whole
night
in
the
commons
house
though
of
course
not
with
so
much
learning
or
so
much
to
the
purpose
because
why
they
are
in
the
house
of
commons
and
we
in
a
public
room
of
an
inn
at
horncastle
the
goodness
of
the
ale
do
ye
see
never
depending
on
what
it
is
made
of
oh
no
but
on
the
fashion
and
appearance
of
the
jug
in
which
it
is
served
up
after
being
turned
out
of
the
firm
i
got
my
living
in
two
or
three
honest
ways
which
i
shall
not
trouble
you
with
describing
i
did
not
like
any
of
them
however
as
they
did
not
exactly
suit
my
humour
at
last
i
found
one
which
did
one
saturday
afternoon
i
chanced
to
be
in
the
of
a
place
about
eighty
miles
from
here
there
i
won
the
favour
of
an
old
gentleman
who
sold
dickeys
he
had
a
very
shabby
squad
of
animals
without
soul
or
spirit
nobody
would
buy
them
till
i
leaped
upon
their
hinder
ends
and
by
merely
wriggling
in
a
particular
manner
made
them
caper
and
bound
so
to
people
liking
that
in
a
few
hours
every
one
of
them
was
sold
at
very
sufficient
prices
the
old
gentleman
was
so
pleased
with
my
skill
that
he
took
me
home
with
him
and
in
a
very
little
time
into
partnership
it
a
good
thing
to
have
a
gift
but
yet
better
to
have
two
i
might
have
got
a
very
decent
livelihood
by
throwing
stones
but
i
much
question
whether
i
should
ever
have
attained
to
the
position
in
society
which
i
now
occupy
but
for
my
knowledge
of
animals
i
lived
very
comfortably
with
the
old
gentleman
till
he
died
which
he
did
in
about
a
fortnight
after
he
had
laid
his
old
lady
in
the
ground
having
no
children
he
left
me
what
should
remain
after
he
had
been
buried
decently
and
the
remainder
was
six
dickeys
and
thirty
shillings
in
silver
i
remained
in
the
dickey
trade
ten
years
during
which
time
i
saved
a
hundred
pounds
i
then
embarked
in
the
horse
line
one
day
being
in
the
market
on
a
saturday
i
saw
mary
fulcher
with
a
halter
round
her
neck
led
about
by
a
man
who
offered
to
sell
her
for
pence
i
took
out
the
money
forthwith
and
bought
her
the
man
was
her
husband
a
with
whom
she
had
lived
several
years
without
having
any
children
he
was
a
drunken
fellow
and
having
had
a
dispute
with
her
the
day
before
he
determined
to
get
rid
of
her
by
putting
a
halter
round
her
neck
and
leading
her
to
the
as
if
she
were
a
mare
which
he
had
it
seems
a
right
to
do
all
women
being
considered
mares
by
old
english
law
and
indeed
still
called
mares
in
certain
counties
where
genuine
old
english
is
still
preserved
that
same
afternoon
the
man
who
had
been
her
husband
having
got
drunk
in
a
with
the
money
which
he
had
received
for
her
quarrelled
with
another
man
and
receiving
a
blow
under
the
ear
fell
upon
the
floor
and
died
of
artiflex
and
in
less
than
three
weeks
i
was
married
to
mary
fulcher
by
virtue
of
regular
bans
i
am
told
she
was
legally
my
property
by
virtue
of
my
having
bought
her
with
a
halter
round
her
neck
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
everybody
should
live
by
his
trade
and
i
did
wish
to
act
shabbily
towards
our
parson
who
is
a
good
fellow
and
has
certainly
a
right
to
his
fees
a
better
wife
than
mary
fulcher
i
mean
mary
dale
no
one
ever
had
she
has
borne
me
several
children
and
has
at
all
times
shown
a
willingness
to
oblige
me
and
to
be
my
faithful
wife
amongst
other
things
i
begged
her
to
have
done
with
her
family
and
i
believe
she
has
never
spoken
to
them
since
i
have
thriven
very
well
in
business
and
my
name
is
up
as
being
a
person
who
can
be
depended
on
when
folks
treats
me
handsomely
i
always
make
a
point
when
a
gentleman
comes
to
me
and
says
dale
or
for
i
have
no
objection
to
be
called
john
by
a
gentleman
wants
a
good
horse
and
am
ready
to
pay
a
good
price
i
always
makes
a
point
i
say
to
furnish
him
with
an
animal
worth
the
money
but
when
i
sees
a
fellow
whether
he
calls
himself
gentleman
or
not
wishing
to
circumvent
me
what
does
i
do
i
does
quarrel
with
him
not
i
but
letting
him
imagine
he
is
taking
me
in
i
contrives
to
sell
him
a
screw
for
thirty
pounds
not
worth
thirty
shillings
all
honest
respectable
people
have
at
present
great
confidence
in
me
and
frequently
commissions
me
to
buy
them
horses
at
great
fairs
like
this
this
short
young
gentleman
was
recommended
to
me
by
a
great
landed
proprietor
to
whom
he
bore
letters
of
recommendation
from
some
great
prince
in
his
own
country
who
had
a
long
time
ago
been
entertained
at
the
house
of
the
landed
proprietor
and
the
consequence
is
that
i
brings
young
six
foot
six
to
horncastle
and
purchases
for
him
the
horse
of
the
romany
rye
i
do
do
these
kind
things
for
nothing
it
is
true
that
ca
be
expected
for
every
one
must
live
by
his
trade
but
as
i
said
before
when
i
am
treated
handsomely
i
treat
folks
so
honesty
i
have
discovered
as
perhaps
some
other
people
have
is
by
far
the
best
policy
though
as
i
also
said
before
when
i
along
with
thieves
i
can
beat
them
at
their
own
game
if
i
am
obliged
to
do
it
i
can
pass
off
the
veriest
screw
as
a
flying
drummedary
for
even
when
i
was
a
child
i
had
found
out
by
various
means
what
may
be
done
with
animals
i
wish
now
to
ask
a
civil
question
romany
rye
certain
folks
have
told
me
that
you
are
a
horse
witch
are
you
one
or
are
you
not
i
like
yourself
said
i
know
to
a
certain
extent
what
may
be
done
with
animals
then
how
would
you
romany
rye
pass
off
the
veriest
screw
in
the
world
for
a
flying
drummedary
by
putting
a
small
live
eel
down
his
throat
as
long
as
the
eel
remained
in
his
stomach
the
horse
would
appear
brisk
and
lively
in
a
surprising
degree
and
how
would
you
contrive
to
make
a
regular
kicker
and
biter
appear
so
tame
and
gentle
that
any
respectable
fat
old
gentleman
of
sixty
who
wanted
an
easy
goer
would
be
glad
to
purchase
him
for
fifty
pounds
by
pouring
down
his
throat
four
pints
of
generous
old
ale
which
would
make
him
so
happy
and
comfortable
that
he
would
not
have
the
heart
to
kick
or
bite
anybody
for
a
season
at
least
and
where
did
you
learn
all
this
said
the
jockey
i
have
read
about
the
eel
in
an
old
english
book
and
about
the
making
drunk
in
a
spanish
novel
and
singularly
enough
i
was
told
the
same
things
by
a
wild
blacksmith
in
ireland
now
tell
me
do
you
bewitch
horses
in
this
way
i
said
the
jockey
mercy
upon
us
i
would
do
such
things
for
a
hatful
of
money
no
no
preserve
me
from
live
eels
and
hocussing
and
now
let
me
ask
you
how
would
you
spirit
a
horse
out
of
a
field
how
would
i
spirit
a
horse
out
of
a
field
yes
supposing
you
were
down
in
the
world
and
had
determined
on
taking
up
the
line
of
business
why
i
should
but
i
tell
you
what
friend
i
see
you
are
trying
to
pump
me
and
i
tell
you
plainly
that
i
will
hear
something
from
you
with
respect
to
your
art
before
i
tell
you
anything
more
now
how
would
you
whisper
a
horse
out
of
a
field
provided
you
were
down
in
the
world
and
so
forth
ah
ah
i
see
you
are
up
to
a
game
romany
however
i
am
a
gentleman
in
mind
if
not
by
birth
and
i
scorn
to
do
the
unhandsome
thing
to
anybody
who
has
dealt
fairly
towards
me
now
you
told
me
something
i
did
know
and
i
tell
you
something
which
perhaps
you
do
know
i
whispers
a
horse
out
of
a
field
in
this
way
i
have
a
mare
in
my
stable
well
in
the
early
season
of
the
year
i
goes
into
my
stable
well
i
puts
the
sponge
into
a
small
bottle
which
i
keeps
corked
i
takes
my
bottle
in
my
hand
and
goes
into
a
field
suppose
by
night
where
there
is
a
very
fine
stag
horse
i
manage
with
great
difficulty
to
get
within
ten
yards
of
the
horse
who
stands
staring
at
me
just
ready
to
run
away
i
then
uncorks
my
bottle
presses
my
to
the
sponge
and
holds
it
out
to
the
horse
the
horse
gives
a
sniff
then
a
start
and
comes
nearer
i
corks
up
my
bottle
and
puts
it
into
my
pocket
my
business
is
done
for
the
next
two
hours
the
horse
would
follow
me
anywhere
the
difficulty
indeed
would
be
to
get
rid
of
him
now
is
that
your
way
of
doing
business
my
way
of
doing
business
mercy
upon
us
i
would
steal
a
horse
in
that
way
or
indeed
in
any
way
for
all
the
money
in
the
world
however
let
me
tell
you
for
your
comfort
that
a
trick
somewhat
similar
is
described
in
the
history
of
herodotus
in
the
history
of
herod
ass
said
the
jockey
well
if
i
did
write
a
book
it
should
be
about
something
more
genteel
than
a
dickey
i
did
not
say
herod
ass
said
i
but
herodotus
a
very
genteel
writer
i
assure
you
who
wrote
a
history
about
very
genteel
people
in
a
language
no
less
genteel
than
greek
more
than
two
thousand
years
ago
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
who
should
be
king
amongst
certain
imperious
chieftains
at
last
they
agreed
to
obey
him
whose
horse
should
neigh
first
on
a
certain
day
in
front
of
the
royal
palace
before
the
rising
of
the
sun
for
you
must
know
that
they
did
not
worship
the
person
who
made
the
sun
as
we
do
but
the
sun
itself
so
one
of
these
chieftains
talking
over
the
matter
to
his
groom
and
saying
he
wondered
who
would
be
king
the
fellow
said
you
master
or
i
do
know
much
about
horses
so
the
day
before
the
day
of
trial
what
does
the
groom
do
but
take
his
master
horse
before
the
palace
and
introduce
him
to
a
mare
in
the
stable
and
then
lead
him
forth
again
well
early
the
next
day
all
the
chieftains
on
their
horses
appeared
in
front
of
the
palace
before
the
dawn
of
day
not
a
horse
neighed
but
one
and
that
was
the
horse
of
him
who
had
consulted
with
his
groom
who
thinking
of
the
animal
within
the
stable
gave
such
a
neigh
that
all
the
buildings
rang
his
rider
was
forthwith
elected
king
and
a
brave
king
he
was
so
this
shows
what
seemingly
wonderful
things
may
be
brought
about
by
a
little
preparation
it
doth
said
the
jockey
what
was
the
chap
name
his
name
his
name
darius
hystaspes
and
the
groom
i
do
know
and
he
made
a
good
king
only
think
well
if
he
made
a
good
king
what
a
wonderful
king
the
groom
would
have
made
through
whose
knowledge
of
he
was
put
on
the
throne
and
now
another
question
romany
rye
have
you
particular
words
which
have
power
to
soothe
or
aggravate
horses
you
should
ask
me
said
i
whether
i
have
horses
that
can
be
aggravated
or
soothed
by
particular
words
no
words
have
any
particular
power
over
horses
or
other
animals
who
have
never
heard
them
before
how
should
they
but
certain
animals
connect
ideas
of
misery
or
enjoyment
with
particular
words
which
they
are
acquainted
with
i
give
you
an
example
i
knew
a
cob
in
ireland
that
could
be
driven
to
a
state
of
kicking
madness
by
a
particular
word
used
by
a
particular
person
in
a
particular
tone
but
that
word
was
connected
with
a
very
painful
operation
which
had
been
performed
upon
him
by
that
individual
who
had
frequently
employed
it
at
a
certain
period
whilst
the
animal
had
been
under
his
treatment
the
same
cob
could
be
soothed
in
a
moment
by
another
word
used
by
the
same
individual
in
a
very
different
kind
of
tone
the
word
was
deaghblasda
or
sweet
tasted
some
time
after
the
operation
whilst
the
cob
was
yet
under
his
hands
the
fellow
who
was
what
the
irish
call
a
fairy
smith
had
done
all
he
could
to
soothe
the
creature
and
had
at
last
succeeded
by
giving
it
of
which
the
cob
became
passionately
fond
invariably
however
before
giving
it
a
button
he
said
with
which
word
the
cob
by
degrees
associated
an
idea
of
unmixed
enjoyment
so
if
he
could
rouse
the
cob
to
madness
by
the
word
which
recalled
the
torture
to
its
remembrance
he
could
as
easily
soothe
it
by
the
other
word
which
the
cob
knew
would
be
instantly
followed
by
the
button
which
the
smith
never
failed
to
give
him
after
using
the
word
deaghblasda
there
is
nothing
wonderful
to
be
done
said
the
jockey
without
a
good
deal
of
preparation
as
i
know
myself
folks
stare
and
wonder
at
certain
things
which
they
would
only
laugh
at
if
they
knew
how
they
were
done
and
to
prove
what
i
say
is
true
i
will
give
you
one
or
two
examples
can
either
of
you
lend
me
a
handkerchief
that
wo
do
said
he
as
i
presented
him
with
a
silk
one
i
wish
for
a
delicate
white
handkerchief
that
just
the
kind
of
thing
said
he
as
the
hungarian
offered
him
a
fine
white
cambric
handkerchief
beautifully
worked
with
gold
at
the
hems
now
you
shall
see
me
set
this
handkerchief
on
fire
do
let
him
do
so
by
any
means
said
the
hungarian
speaking
to
me
in
german
it
is
the
gift
of
a
lady
whom
i
highly
admire
and
i
would
not
have
it
burnt
for
the
world
he
has
no
occasion
to
be
under
any
apprehension
said
the
jockey
after
i
had
interpreted
to
him
what
the
hungarian
had
said
i
will
restore
it
to
him
uninjured
or
my
name
is
not
jack
dale
then
sticking
the
handkerchief
carelessly
into
the
left
side
of
his
bosom
he
took
the
candle
which
by
this
time
had
burnt
very
low
and
holding
his
head
back
he
applied
the
flame
to
the
handkerchief
which
instantly
seemed
to
catch
fire
what
do
you
think
of
that
said
he
to
the
hungarian
why
that
you
have
ruined
me
said
the
latter
no
harm
done
i
assure
you
said
the
jockey
who
presently
clapping
his
hand
on
his
bosom
extinguished
the
fire
and
returned
the
handkerchief
to
the
hungarian
asking
him
if
it
was
burnt
i
see
no
burn
upon
it
said
the
hungarian
but
in
the
name
of
gott
how
could
you
set
it
on
fire
without
burning
it
i
never
set
it
on
fire
at
all
said
the
jockey
i
set
this
on
fire
showing
us
a
piece
of
calico
i
placed
this
calico
above
it
and
lighted
not
the
handkerchief
but
the
rag
now
i
will
show
you
something
else
i
have
a
magic
shilling
in
my
pocket
which
i
can
make
run
up
along
my
arm
but
first
of
all
i
would
gladly
know
whether
either
of
you
can
do
the
like
thereupon
the
hungarian
and
myself
putting
our
hands
into
our
pockets
took
out
shillings
and
endeavoured
to
make
them
run
up
our
arms
but
utterly
failed
both
shillings
after
we
had
made
two
or
three
attempts
falling
to
the
ground
what
noncomposses
you
both
are
said
the
jockey
and
placing
a
shilling
on
the
end
of
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
he
made
strange
faces
to
it
drawing
back
his
head
whereupon
the
shilling
instantly
began
to
run
up
his
arm
occasionally
hopping
and
jumping
as
if
it
were
bewitched
always
endeavouring
to
make
towards
the
head
of
the
jockey
how
do
i
do
that
said
he
addressing
himself
to
me
i
really
do
not
know
said
i
unless
it
is
by
the
motion
of
your
arm
the
motion
of
my
nonsense
said
the
jockey
and
making
a
dreadful
grimace
the
shilling
hopped
upon
his
knee
and
began
to
run
up
his
thigh
and
to
climb
up
his
breast
how
is
that
done
said
he
again
by
witchcraft
i
suppose
said
i
there
you
are
right
said
the
jockey
by
the
witchcraft
of
one
of
miss
berners
hairs
the
end
of
one
of
her
long
hairs
is
tied
to
that
shilling
by
means
of
a
hole
in
it
and
the
other
end
goes
round
my
neck
by
means
of
a
loop
so
that
when
i
draw
back
my
head
the
shilling
follows
it
i
suppose
you
wish
to
know
how
i
got
the
hair
said
he
grinning
at
me
i
will
tell
you
i
once
in
the
course
of
my
ridings
saw
miss
berners
beneath
a
hedge
combing
out
her
long
hair
and
being
rather
a
modest
kind
of
person
what
must
i
do
but
get
off
my
horse
tie
him
to
a
gate
go
up
to
her
and
endeavour
to
enter
into
conversation
with
her
after
giving
her
the
sele
of
the
day
and
complimenting
her
on
her
hair
i
asked
her
to
give
me
one
of
the
threads
whereupon
she
gave
me
such
a
look
and
calling
me
fellow
told
me
to
take
myself
off
must
have
a
hair
first
said
i
making
a
snatch
at
one
i
believe
i
hurt
her
but
whether
i
did
or
not
up
she
started
and
though
her
hair
was
unbound
gave
me
the
only
drubbing
i
ever
had
in
my
life
lor
how
with
her
right
hand
she
fibbed
me
whilst
she
held
me
round
the
neck
with
her
left
arm
i
was
soon
glad
to
beg
her
pardon
on
my
knees
which
she
gave
me
in
a
moment
when
she
saw
me
in
that
condition
being
the
most
placable
creature
in
the
world
and
not
only
her
pardon
but
one
of
the
hairs
which
i
longed
for
which
i
put
through
a
shilling
with
which
i
have
on
evenings
after
fairs
like
this
frequently
worked
what
seemed
to
those
who
looked
on
downright
witchcraft
but
which
is
nothing
more
than
pleasant
deception
and
now
romany
rye
to
testify
my
regard
for
you
i
give
you
the
shilling
and
the
hair
i
think
you
have
a
kind
of
respect
for
miss
berners
but
whether
you
have
or
not
keep
them
as
long
as
you
can
and
whenever
you
look
at
them
think
of
the
finest
woman
in
england
and
of
john
dale
the
jockey
of
horncastle
i
believe
i
have
told
you
my
history
said
he
no
not
quite
there
is
one
circumstance
i
had
passed
over
i
told
you
that
i
have
thriven
very
well
in
business
and
so
i
have
upon
the
whole
at
any
rate
i
find
myself
comfortably
off
now
i
have
horses
money
and
owe
nobody
a
groat
at
any
rate
nothing
but
what
i
could
pay
yet
i
have
had
my
dreary
day
ay
after
i
had
obtained
what
i
call
a
station
in
the
world
all
of
a
sudden
about
five
years
ago
everything
seemed
to
go
wrong
with
me
horses
became
sick
or
died
people
who
owed
me
money
broke
or
ran
away
my
house
caught
fire
in
fact
everything
went
against
me
and
not
from
any
mismanagement
of
my
own
i
looked
round
for
help
but
what
do
you
think
nobody
would
help
me
somehow
or
other
it
had
got
abroad
that
i
was
in
difficulties
and
everybody
seemed
disposed
to
avoid
me
as
if
i
had
got
the
plague
those
who
were
always
offering
me
help
when
i
wanted
none
now
when
they
thought
me
in
trouble
talked
of
arresting
me
yes
two
particular
friends
of
mine
who
had
always
been
offering
me
their
purses
when
my
own
was
stuffed
full
now
talked
of
arresting
me
though
i
only
owed
the
scoundrels
a
hundred
pounds
each
and
they
would
have
done
so
provided
i
had
not
paid
them
what
i
owed
them
and
how
did
i
do
that
why
i
was
able
to
do
it
because
i
found
a
friend
and
who
was
that
friend
why
a
man
who
has
since
been
hung
of
whom
everybody
has
heard
and
of
whom
everybody
for
the
next
hundred
years
will
occasionally
talk
one
day
whilst
in
trouble
i
was
visited
by
a
person
i
had
occasionally
met
at
he
came
to
look
after
a
suffolk
punch
the
best
horse
by
the
bye
that
anybody
can
purchase
to
drive
it
being
the
only
animal
of
the
horse
kind
in
england
that
will
pull
twice
at
a
dead
weight
i
told
him
that
i
had
none
at
that
time
that
i
could
recommend
in
fact
that
every
horse
in
my
stable
was
sick
he
then
invited
me
to
dine
with
him
at
an
inn
close
by
and
i
was
glad
to
go
with
him
in
the
hope
of
getting
rid
of
unpleasant
thoughts
after
dinner
during
which
he
talked
nothing
but
slang
observing
i
looked
very
melancholy
he
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
with
me
and
i
my
heart
being
opened
by
the
wine
he
had
made
me
drink
told
him
my
circumstances
without
reserve
with
an
oath
or
two
for
not
having
treated
him
at
first
like
a
friend
he
said
he
would
soon
set
me
all
right
and
pulling
out
two
hundred
pounds
told
me
to
pay
him
when
i
could
i
felt
as
i
never
felt
before
however
i
took
his
notes
paid
my
sneaks
and
in
less
than
three
months
was
right
again
and
had
returned
him
his
money
on
paying
it
to
him
i
said
that
i
had
now
a
punch
which
would
just
suit
him
saying
that
i
would
give
it
to
him
a
free
gift
for
nothing
he
swore
at
me
telling
me
to
keep
my
punch
for
that
he
was
suited
already
i
begged
him
to
tell
me
how
i
could
requite
him
for
his
kindness
whereupon
with
the
most
dreadful
oath
i
ever
heard
he
bade
me
come
and
see
him
hanged
when
his
time
was
come
i
wrung
his
hand
and
told
him
i
would
and
i
kept
my
word
the
night
before
the
day
he
was
hanged
at
h
i
harnessed
a
suffolk
punch
to
my
light
gig
the
same
punch
which
i
had
offered
to
him
which
i
have
ever
since
kept
and
which
brought
me
and
this
short
young
man
to
horncastle
and
in
eleven
hours
i
drove
that
punch
one
hundred
and
ten
miles
i
arrived
at
h
just
in
the
nick
of
time
there
was
the
ugly
jail
the
scaffold
and
there
upon
it
stood
the
only
friend
i
ever
had
in
the
world
driving
my
punch
which
was
all
in
a
foam
into
the
midst
of
the
crowd
which
made
way
for
me
as
if
it
knew
what
i
came
for
i
stood
up
in
my
gig
took
off
my
hat
and
shouted
almighty
bless
you
jack
the
dying
man
turned
his
pale
grim
face
towards
me
for
his
face
was
always
somewhat
grim
do
you
see
nodded
and
said
or
i
thought
i
heard
him
say
right
old
chap
the
next
moment
my
eyes
water
he
had
a
high
heart
got
into
a
scrape
whilst
in
the
marines
lost
his
pay
took
to
the
turf
ring
gambling
and
at
last
cut
the
throat
of
a
villain
who
had
robbed
him
of
nearly
all
he
had
but
he
had
good
qualities
and
i
know
for
certain
that
he
never
did
half
the
bad
things
laid
to
his
charge
for
example
he
never
bribed
tom
oliver
to
fight
cross
as
it
was
said
he
did
on
the
day
of
the
awful
ned
flatnose
fairly
beat
tom
oliver
for
though
ned
was
not
what
called
a
good
fighter
he
had
a
particular
blow
which
if
he
could
put
in
he
was
sure
to
win
his
right
shoulder
do
you
see
was
two
inches
farther
back
than
it
ought
to
have
been
and
consequently
his
right
fist
generally
fell
short
but
if
he
could
swing
himself
round
and
put
in
a
blow
with
that
right
arm
he
could
kill
or
take
away
the
senses
of
anybody
in
the
world
it
was
by
putting
in
that
blow
in
his
second
fight
with
spring
that
he
beat
noble
tom
spring
beat
him
like
a
sack
in
the
first
battle
but
in
the
second
ned
painter
for
that
was
his
real
name
contrived
to
put
in
his
blow
and
took
the
senses
out
of
spring
and
in
like
manner
he
took
the
senses
out
of
tom
oliver
well
some
are
born
to
be
hanged
and
some
are
not
and
many
of
those
who
are
not
hanged
are
much
worse
than
those
who
are
jack
with
many
a
good
quality
is
hanged
whilst
that
fellow
of
a
lord
who
wanted
to
get
the
horse
from
you
at
about
of
his
value
without
a
single
good
quality
in
the
world
is
not
hanged
and
probably
will
remain
so
you
ask
the
reason
why
perhaps
i
tell
you
the
lack
of
a
certain
quality
called
courage
which
jack
possessed
in
abundance
will
preserve
him
from
the
love
which
he
bears
his
own
neck
he
will
do
nothing
which
can
bring
him
to
the
gallows
in
my
rough
way
i
draw
their
characters
from
their
childhood
and
then
ask
whether
jack
was
not
the
best
character
of
the
two
jack
was
a
rough
audacious
boy
fond
of
fighting
going
a
but
i
never
heard
he
did
anything
particularly
cruel
save
once
i
believe
tying
a
canister
to
a
butcher
dog
tail
whilst
this
fellow
of
a
lord
was
by
nature
a
savage
beast
and
when
a
boy
would
in
winter
pluck
poor
fowls
naked
and
set
them
running
on
the
ice
and
in
the
snow
and
was
particularly
fond
of
burning
cats
alive
in
the
fire
jack
when
a
lad
gets
a
commission
on
board
a
ship
as
an
officer
of
horse
marines
and
in
two
or
three
engagements
behaves
quite
up
to
the
mark
at
least
of
a
marine
the
marines
having
no
particular
character
for
courage
you
know
never
having
run
to
the
guns
and
fired
them
like
madmen
after
the
blue
jackets
had
had
more
than
enough
oh
dear
me
no
my
lord
gets
into
the
valorous
british
army
where
cowardice
oh
dear
me
is
a
thing
almost
entirely
unknown
and
being
on
the
field
of
waterloo
the
day
before
the
battle
falls
off
his
horse
and
pretending
to
be
hurt
in
the
back
gets
himself
put
on
the
sick
list
a
pretty
excuse
hurting
his
back
for
not
being
present
at
such
a
fight
old
benbow
after
part
of
both
his
legs
had
been
shot
away
in
a
made
the
carpenter
make
him
a
cradle
to
hold
his
bloody
stumps
and
continued
on
deck
cheering
his
men
till
he
died
jack
returns
home
and
gets
into
trouble
and
having
nothing
to
subsist
by
but
his
wits
gets
his
living
by
the
ring
and
the
turf
doing
many
an
odd
kind
of
thing
i
dare
say
but
not
half
those
laid
to
his
charge
my
lord
does
much
the
same
without
the
excuse
for
doing
so
which
jack
had
for
he
had
plenty
of
means
is
a
leg
and
a
black
only
in
a
more
polished
way
and
with
more
cunning
and
i
may
say
success
having
done
many
a
rascally
thing
never
laid
to
his
charge
jack
at
last
cuts
the
throat
of
a
villain
who
had
cheated
him
of
all
he
had
in
the
world
and
who
i
am
told
was
in
many
points
the
counterpart
of
this
screw
and
white
feather
is
taken
up
tried
and
executed
and
certainly
taking
away
a
man
life
is
a
dreadful
thing
but
is
there
nothing
as
bad
whitefeather
will
cut
no
throat
i
will
not
say
who
has
cheated
him
for
being
a
cheat
himself
he
will
take
good
care
that
nobody
cheats
him
but
he
do
something
quite
as
bad
out
of
envy
to
a
person
who
never
injured
him
and
whom
he
hates
for
being
more
clever
and
respected
than
himself
he
will
do
all
he
possibly
can
by
backbiting
and
every
unfair
means
to
do
that
person
a
mortal
injury
but
jack
is
hanged
and
my
lord
it
not
is
that
right
my
wife
mary
fulcher
i
beg
her
pardon
mary
dale
who
is
a
methodist
and
has
heard
the
mighty
preacher
peter
williams
says
some
people
are
preserved
from
hanging
by
the
grace
of
god
with
her
i
differs
and
says
it
is
from
want
of
courage
this
whitefeather
with
one
particle
of
jack
courage
and
with
one
tithe
of
his
good
qualities
would
have
been
hanged
long
ago
for
he
has
ten
times
jack
malignity
jack
was
hanged
because
along
with
his
bad
qualities
he
had
courage
and
generosity
this
fellow
is
not
because
with
all
jack
bad
qualities
and
many
more
amongst
which
is
cunning
he
has
neither
courage
nor
generosity
think
of
a
fellow
like
that
putting
down
two
hundred
pounds
to
relieve
a
distressed
why
he
would
rob
but
for
the
law
and
the
fear
it
fills
him
with
a
workhouse
child
of
its
breakfast
as
the
saying
is
and
has
been
heard
to
say
that
he
would
not
trust
his
own
father
for
sixpence
and
he
ca
imagine
why
such
a
thing
as
credit
should
be
ever
given
i
never
heard
a
person
give
him
a
good
word
stay
stay
yes
i
once
heard
an
old
parson
to
whom
i
sold
a
punch
say
that
he
had
the
art
of
receiving
company
gracefully
and
dismissing
them
without
refreshment
i
do
wish
to
be
too
hard
with
him
and
so
let
him
make
the
most
of
that
compliment
well
he
manages
to
get
on
whilst
jack
is
hanged
not
quite
enviably
however
he
has
had
his
rubs
and
pretty
hard
ones
everybody
knows
he
slunk
from
waterloo
and
occasionally
checks
him
with
so
doing
whilst
he
has
been
rejected
by
a
woman
what
a
mortification
to
the
low
pride
of
which
the
scoundrel
has
plenty
a
song
about
both
circumstances
which
may
perhaps
ring
in
his
ears
on
a
dying
bed
it
a
funny
kind
of
song
set
to
the
old
tune
of
the
lieutenant
or
deputy
and
with
it
i
will
conclude
my
discourse
for
i
really
think
it
past
one

jockey

with
a
very
tolerable

chapter
xliii
the
church
the
next
morning
i
began
to
think
of
departing
i
had
sewed
up
the
money
which
i
had
received
for
the
horse
in
a
portion
of
my
clothing
where
i
entertained
no
fears
for
its
safety
with
the
exception
of
a
small
sum
in
notes
gold
and
silver
which
i
carried
in
my
pocket
ere
departing
however
i
determined
to
stroll
about
and
examine
the
town
and
observe
more
particularly
the
humours
of
the
fair
than
i
had
hitherto
an
opportunity
of
doing
the
town
when
i
examined
it
offered
no
object
worthy
of
attention
but
its
church
an
edifice
of
some
antiquity
under
the
guidance
of
an
old
man
who
officiated
as
sexton
i
inspected
its
interior
attentively
occasionally
conversing
with
my
guide
who
however
seemed
much
more
disposed
to
talk
about
horses
than
the
church
no
good
horses
in
the
fair
this
time
measter
said
he
none
but
one
brought
hither
by
a
chap
whom
nobody
knows
and
bought
by
a
foreigneering
man
who
came
here
with
jack
dale
the
horse
fetched
a
good
swinging
price
which
is
said
however
to
be
much
less
than
its
worth
for
the
horse
is
a
regular
clipper
not
such
a
one
is
said
has
been
seen
in
the
fair
for
several
summers
lord
whitefeather
says
that
he
believes
the
fellow
who
brought
him
to
be
a
highwayman
and
talks
of
having
him
taken
up
but
lord
whitefeather
is
only
in
a
rage
because
he
could
not
get
him
for
himself
the
chap
would
not
sell
it
to
un
lord
screw
wanted
to
beat
him
down
and
the
chap
took
huff
said
he
would
sell
it
to
him
at
no
price
and
accepted
the
offer
of
the
foreigneering
man
or
of
jack
who
was
his
and
who
scorned
to
higgle
about
such
a
hanimal
because
jack
is
a
gentleman
though
bred
a
whilst
though
bred
a
lord
is
a
screw
and
a
whitefeather
every
one
says
the
cove
was
right
and
i
says
so
too
i
likes
spirit
and
if
the
cove
were
here
and
in
your
place
measter
i
would
invite
him
to
drink
a
pint
of
beer
good
horses
are
scarce
now
measter
ay
and
so
are
good
men
quite
a
different
set
from
what
there
were
when
i
was
young
that
was
the
time
for
men
and
horses
lord
bless
you
i
know
all
the
breeders
about
here
they
are
not
a
bad
set
and
they
breed
a
very
fairish
set
of
horses
but
they
are
not
like
what
their
fathers
were
nor
are
their
horses
like
their
fathers
horses
now
there
is
the
great
breeder
a
very
fairish
man
with
very
fairish
horses
but
lord
bless
you
he
nothing
to
what
his
father
was
nor
his
steeds
to
his
father
i
ought
to
know
for
i
was
at
the
school
here
with
his
father
and
afterwards
for
many
a
year
helped
him
to
get
up
his
horses
that
was
when
i
was
young
measter
those
were
the
days
you
look
at
that
monument
measter
said
he
as
i
stopped
and
looked
attentively
at
a
monument
on
the
southern
side
of
the
church
near
the
altar
that
was
put
up
for
a
rector
of
this
church
who
lived
a
long
time
ago
in
oliver
time
and
was
and
imprisoned
by
oliver
and
his
men
you
will
see
all
about
it
on
the
monument
there
was
a
grand
battle
fought
nigh
this
place
between
oliver
men
and
the
royal
party
and
the
royal
party
had
the
worst
of
it
as
i
told
they
generally
had
and
oliver
men
came
into
the
town
and
did
a
great
deal
of
damage
and
the
people
i
ca
remember
anything
about
the
matter
myself
for
it
happened
just
one
hundred
years
before
i
was
born
but
my
father
was
acquainted
with
an
old
countryman
who
lived
not
many
miles
from
here
who
said
he
remembered
perfectly
well
the
day
of
the
battle
that
he
was
a
boy
at
the
time
and
was
working
in
a
field
near
the
place
where
the
battle
was
fought
and
heard
shouting
and
noise
of
firearms
and
also
the
sound
of
several
balls
which
fell
in
the
field
near
him
come
this
way
measter
and
i
will
show
you
some
remains
of
that
day
field
leaving
the
monument
on
which
was
inscribed
an
account
of
the
life
and
sufferings
of
the
royalist
rector
of
horncastle
i
followed
the
sexton
to
the
western
end
of
the
church
where
hanging
against
the
wall
were
a
number
of
scythes
stuck
in
the
ends
of
poles
those
are
the
weapons
measter
said
the
sexton
which
the
great
people
put
into
the
hands
of
the
country
folks
in
order
that
they
might
use
them
against
men
ugly
weapons
enough
however
oliver
men
won
and
sir
jacob
ashley
and
his
party
were
beat
and
a
rare
time
oliver
and
his
men
had
of
it
till
oliver
died
when
the
other
party
got
the
better
not
by
fighting
said
but
through
a
general
monk
who
turned
sides
ah
the
old
fellow
that
my
father
knew
said
he
well
remembered
the
time
when
general
monk
went
over
and
proclaimed
charles
the
second
bonfires
were
lighted
everywhere
oxen
roasted
and
beer
drunk
by
pailfuls
the
country
folks
were
drunk
with
joy
and
something
else
sung
scurvy
songs
about
oliver
to
the
tune
of
barney
banks
and
pelted
his
men
wherever
they
found
them
with
stones
and
dirt
the
more
ungrateful
scoundrels
they
said
i
oliver
and
his
men
fought
the
battle
of
english
independence
against
a
wretched
king
and
corrupt
lords
had
i
been
living
at
the
time
i
should
have
been
proud
to
be
a
trooper
of
oliver
you
would
measter
would
you
well
i
never
quarrels
with
the
opinions
of
people
who
come
to
look
at
the
church
and
certainly
independence
is
a
fine
thing
i
like
to
see
a
chap
of
an
independent
spirit
and
if
i
were
now
to
see
the
cove
that
refused
to
sell
his
horse
to
my
lord
screw
and
whitefeather
and
let
jack
dale
have
him
i
would
offer
to
treat
him
to
a
pint
of
beer
i
would
verily
well
measter
you
have
now
seen
the
church
and
all
there
in
it
worth
seeing
so
i
just
lock
up
and
go
and
finish
digging
the
grave
i
was
about
when
you
came
after
which
i
must
go
into
the
fair
to
see
how
matters
are
going
on
thank
ye
measter
said
he
as
i
put
something
into
his
hand
thank
ye
kindly
not
every
one
who
gives
me
a
shilling
who
comes
to
see
the
church
but
times
are
very
different
from
what
they
were
when
i
was
young
i
was
not
sexton
then
but
something
better
helped
with
his
horses
and
got
many
a
broad
crown
those
were
the
days
measter
both
for
men
and
horses
and
i
say
measter
if
men
and
horses
were
so
much
better
when
i
was
young
than
they
are
now
what
i
wonder
must
they
have
been
in
the
time
of
oliver
and
his
men
chapter
xliv
an
old
acquaintance
leaving
the
church
i
strolled
through
the
fair
looking
at
the
horses
listening
to
the
chaffering
of
the
buyers
and
sellers
and
occasionally
putting
in
a
word
of
my
own
which
was
not
always
received
with
much
deference
suddenly
however
on
a
whisper
arising
that
i
was
the
young
cove
who
had
brought
the
wonderful
horse
to
the
fair
which
jack
dale
had
bought
for
the
foreigneering
man
i
found
myself
an
object
of
the
greatest
attention
those
who
had
before
replied
with
stuff
and
nonsense
to
what
i
said
now
listened
with
the
greatest
eagerness
to
any
nonsense
i
wished
to
utter
and
i
did
not
fail
to
utter
a
great
deal
presently
however
becoming
disgusted
with
the
beings
about
me
i
forced
my
way
not
very
civilly
through
my
crowd
of
admirers
and
passing
through
an
alley
and
a
back
street
at
last
reached
an
outskirt
of
the
fair
where
no
person
appeared
to
know
me
here
i
stood
looking
vacantly
on
what
was
going
on
musing
on
the
strange
infatuation
of
my
species
who
judge
of
a
person
words
not
from
their
intrinsic
merit
but
from
the
opinion
generally
an
erroneous
one
which
they
have
formed
of
the
person
from
this
reverie
i
was
roused
by
certain
words
which
sounded
near
me
uttered
in
a
strange
tone
and
in
a
strange
cadence
the
words
were
them
that
finds
wins
and
them
that
ca
find
loses
turning
my
eyes
in
the
direction
from
which
the
words
proceeded
i
saw
six
or
seven
people
apparently
all
countrymen
gathered
round
a
person
standing
behind
a
tall
white
table
of
very
small
compass
what
said
i
the
of
fair
here
at
horncastle
advancing
nearer
however
i
perceived
that
though
the
present
person
was
a
he
was
a
very
different
one
from
my
old
acquaintance
of
fair
the
present
one
was
a
fellow
about
taller
than
the
other
he
had
a
long
haggard
wild
face
and
was
dressed
in
a
kind
of
jacket
something
like
that
of
a
soldier
with
dirty
hempen
trousers
and
with
a
peaked
hat
on
his
head
he
spoke
with
an
accent
evidently
irish
and
occasionally
changed
the
usual
thimble
formule
them
that
finds
wins
and
them
that
ca
och
sure
they
loses
saying
also
frequently
your
honour
instead
of
my
lord
i
observed
on
drawing
nearer
that
he
handled
the
pea
and
thimble
with
some
awkwardness
like
that
which
might
be
expected
from
a
novice
in
the
trade
he
contrived
however
to
win
several
shillings
for
he
did
not
seem
to
play
for
gold
from
their
honours
awkward
as
he
was
he
evidently
did
his
best
and
never
flung
a
chance
away
by
permitting
any
one
to
win
he
had
just
won
three
shillings
from
a
farmer
who
incensed
at
his
loss
was
calling
him
a
confounded
cheat
and
saying
that
he
would
play
no
more
when
up
came
my
friend
of
the
preceding
day
jack
the
jockey
this
worthy
after
looking
at
the
a
moment
or
two
with
a
peculiarly
crafty
glance
cried
out
as
he
clapped
down
a
shilling
on
the
table
i
will
stand
you
old
fellow
them
that
finds
wins
and
them
that
ca
och
sure
they
loses
said
the
the
game
commenced
and
jack
took
up
the
thimble
without
finding
the
pea
another
shilling
was
produced
and
lost
in
the
same
manner
this
is
slow
work
said
jack
banging
down
a
guinea
on
the
table
can
you
cover
that
old
fellow
the
man
of
the
thimble
looked
at
the
gold
and
then
at
him
who
produced
it
and
scratched
his
head
come
cover
that
or
i
shall
be
off
said
the
jockey
och
sure
my
lord
no
i
mean
your
honour
no
sure
your
lordship
said
the
other
if
i
covers
it
at
all
it
must
be
with
silver
for
divil
a
bit
of
gold
have
i
by
me
well
then
produce
the
value
in
silver
said
the
jockey
and
do
it
quickly
for
i
ca
be
staying
here
all
day
the
hesitated
looked
at
jack
with
a
dubious
look
then
at
the
gold
and
then
scratched
his
head
there
was
now
a
laugh
amongst
the
surrounders
which
evidently
nettled
the
fellow
who
forthwith
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
pulling
out
all
his
silver
treasure
just
contrived
to
place
the
value
of
the
guinea
on
the
table
them
that
finds
wins
and
them
that
ca
find
interrupted
jack
lifting
up
a
thimble
out
of
which
rolled
a
pea
there
paddy
what
do
you
think
of
that
said
he
seizing
the
heap
of
silver
with
one
hand
whilst
he
pocketed
the
guinea
with
the
other
the
stood
for
some
time
like
one
transfixed
his
eyes
glaring
wildly
now
at
the
table
and
now
at
his
successful
customers
at
last
he
said
arrah
sure
master
no
i
manes
my
lord
you
are
not
going
to
ruin
a
poor
boy
ruin
you
said
the
other
what
by
winning
a
guinea
change
a
pretty
small
dodger
you
if
you
have
not
sufficient
capital
why
do
you
engage
in
so
deep
a
trade
as
thimbling
come
will

stand
another
game
och
sure

twenty
shillings
and

jack

again
and
i
will
knock

that
the
pea
under
the
thimble

money

likely
thing
said
jack
no

two
or
three
of
that
whether
the
pea
was
yours
or
mine
you
will

twenty
shillings

and
if

better

such
villains
as

dirty
tricks

knock

and
rob
on
the
road
if
you
had
but
courage
not

i
mean
to
keep
your
shillings
with
the
exception
of
the
two
you
cheated
from
me
which
i
keep
a
scramble
boys
a
scramble
said
he
flinging
up
all
the
silver
into
the
air
with
the
exception
of
the
two
shillings
and
a
scramble
there
instantly
was
between
the
rustics
who
had
lost
their
money
and
the
urchins
who
came
running
up
the
poor
tried
likewise
to
have
his
share
and
though
he
flung
himself
down
in
order
to
join
more
effectually
in
the
scramble
he
was
unable
to
obtain
a
single
sixpence
and
having
in
his
rage
given
some
of
his
a
cuff
or
two
he
was
set
upon
by
the
boys
and
country
fellows
and
compelled
to
make
an
inglorious
retreat
with
his
table
which
had
been
flung
down
in
the
scuffle
and
had
one
of
its
legs
broken
as
he
retired
the
rabble
hooted
and
jack
holding
up
in
derision
the
pea
with
which
he
had
outmanoeuvred
him
exclaimed
i
always
carry
this
in
my
pocket
in
order
to
be
a
match
for
vagabonds
like
you
the
tumult
over
jack
gone
and
the
rabble
dispersed
i
followed
the
discomfited
adventurer
at
a
distance
who
leaving
the
town
went
slowly
on
carrying
his
dilapidated
piece
of
furniture
till
coming
to
an
old
wall
by
the
roadside
he
placed
it
on
the
ground
and
sat
down
seemingly
in
deep
despondency
holding
his
thumb
to
his
mouth
going
nearly
up
to
him
i
stood
still
whereupon
he
looked
up
and
perceiving
i
was
looking
steadfastly
at
him
he
said
in
an
angry
tone
arrah
what
for
are
you
staring
at
me
so
by
my
shoul
i
think
you
are
one
of
the
thaives

think

saw
you
among
them

would
take
the
liberty
of
trying
to
give

big
bating

had
enough
of
trying
to
give

i

skilful
carpenter
to
get
it
repaired

will
do
it
for
sixpence

he
and

ugly
head

foot
of

was
gazed
at
me
for
a
moment
with
a
bewildered
look
then

a
gleam
of
intelligence
in
his
eye
he
said
shorsha
no

ca
be

my
faith

springing
up
and
seizing

seeing
murtagh
in
such
a
distressed
plight
i
forthwith

again
the
tale
of
the
snake
in
precisely
the
same
words
as
i
have
related
it
in
the
first
part
of
this
history
after
which
i
said

dungarvon
times
of

i
mean
the
times
we
were
at
school
together
cheer
up
man
said
i
and
let
have
the
story
and
let
it
be
about
and
the
salmon
and
his
thumb
arrah
shorsha
i
ca
well
to
oblige
you
i
give
it
you
well
you
know
was
an
exposed
child
and
came
floating
over
the
salt
sea
in
a
chest
which
was
cast
ashore
at
veintry
bay
in
the
corner
of
that
bay
was
a
castle
where
dwelt
a
giant
and
his
wife
very
respectable
and
decent
people
and
this
giant
taking
his
morning
walk
along
the
bay
came
to
the
place
where
the
child
had
been
cast
ashore
in
his
box
well
the
giant
looked
at
the
child
and
being
filled
with
compassion
for
his
exposed
state
took
the
child
up
in
his
box
and
carried
him
home
to
his
castle
where
he
and
his
wife
being
dacent
respectable
people
as
i
telled
ye
before
fostered
the
child
and
took
care
of
him
till
he
became
old
enough
to
go
out
to
service
and
gain
his
livelihood
when
they
bound
him
out
apprentice
to
another
giant
who
lived
in
a
castle
up
the
country
at
some
distance
from
the
bay
this
giant
whose
name
was
darmod
david
odeen
was
not
a
respectable
person
at
all
but
a
big
old
vagabond
he
was
twice
the
size
of
the
other
giant
who
though
bigger
than
any
man
was
not
a
big
giant
for
as
there
are
great
and
small
men
so
there
are
great
and
small
giants
i
mean
some
are
small
when
compared
with
the
others
well
finn
served
this
giant
a
considerable
time
doing
all
kinds
of
hard
and
unreasonable
service
for
him
and
receiving
all
kinds
of
hard
words
and
many
a
hard
knock
and
kick
to
boot
sorrow
befall
the
old
vagabond
who
could
thus
treat
a
helpless
foundling
it
chanced
that
one
day
the
giant
caught
a
salmon
near
a
upon
his
estate
for
though
a
big
ould
blackguard
he
was
a
person
of
considerable
landed
property
and
high
sheriff
for
the
county
cork
well
the
giant
brings
home
the
salmon
by
the
gills
and
delivers
it
to
finn
telling
him
to
roast
it
for
the
giant
dinner
take
care
ye
young
blackguard
he
added
in
roasting
it
and
i
expect
ye
to
roast
it
well
you
do
not
let
a
blister
come
upon
its
nice
satin
skin
for
if
ye
do
i
will
cut
the
head
off
your
shoulders
thinks
finn
is
a
hard
task
however
as
i
have
done
many
hard
tasks
for
him
i
will
try
and
do
this
too
though
i
was
never
set
to
do
anything
yet
half
so
difficult
so
he
prepared
his
fire
and
put
his
gridiron
upon
it
and
lays
the
salmon
fairly
and
softly
upon
the
gridiron
and
then
he
roasts
it
turning
it
from
one
side
to
the
other
just
in
the
nick
of
time
before
the
soft
satin
skin
could
be
blistered
however
on
turning
it
over
the
eleventh
time
and
twelve
would
have
settled
the
business
he
found
he
had
delayed
a
little
bit
of
time
too
long
in
turning
it
over
and
that
there
was
a
small
tiny
blister
on
the
soft
outer
skin
well
finn
was
in
a
mighty
panic
remembering
the
threats
of
the
ould
giant
however
he
did
not
lose
heart
but
clapped
his
thumb
upon
the
blister
in
order
to
smooth
it
down
now
the
salmon
shorsha
was
nearly
done
and
the
flesh
thoroughly
hot
so
finn
thumb
was
scalt
and
he
clapping
it
to
his
mouth
sucked
it
in
order
to
draw
out
the
pain
and
in
a
moment
hubbuboo
became
imbued
with
all
the
wisdom
of
the
world
stop
murtagh
stop
all
the
witchcraft
shorsha
how
wonderful
was
it
not
shorsha
the
salmon
do
you
see
was
a
fairy
salmon
what
a
strange
coincidence
a
what
shorsha
why
that
the
very
same
tale
should
be
told
of
which
is
related
of
sigurd
fafnisbane
what
thief
was
that
shorsha
thief
is
true
he
took
the
treasure
of
fafnir
sigurd
was
the
hero
of
the
north
murtagh
even
as
finn
is
the
great
hero
of
ireland
he
too
according
to
one
account
was
an
exposed
child
and
came
floating
in
a
casket
to
a
wild
shore
where
he
was
suckled
by
a
hind
and
afterwards
found
and
fostered
by
mimir
a
fairy
blacksmith
he
too
sucked
wisdom
from
a
burn
according
to
the
edda
he
burnt
his
finger
whilst
feeling
of
the
heart
of
fafnir
which
he
was
roasting
and
putting
it
into
his
mouth
in
order
to
suck
out
the
pain
became
imbued
with
all
the
wisdom
of
the
world
the
knowledge
of
the
language
of
birds
and
what
not
i
have
heard
you
tell
the
tale
of
finn
a
dozen
times
in
the
blessed
days
of
old
but
its
identity
with
the
tale
of
sigurd
never
occurred
to
me
till
now
it
is
true
when
i
knew
you
of
old
i
had
never
read
the
tale
of
sigurd
and
have
since
almost
dismissed
matters
of
ireland
from
my
mind
but
as
soon
as
you
told
me
again
about
finn
burning
his
finger
the
coincidence
struck
me
i
say
murtagh
the
irish
owe
much
to
the
danes
devil
a
bit
shorsha
do
they
owe
to
the
thaives
except
many
a
bloody
bating
and
plundering
which
they
never
paid
them
back
och
shorsha
you
edicated
in
ould
ireland
to
say
that
the
irish
owes
anything
good
to
the
plundering
villains
the
siol
loughlin
they
owe
them
half
their
traditions
murtagh
and
amongst
others
and
the
burnt
finger
and
if
ever
i
publish
the
loughlin
songs
i
tell
the
world
so
but
shorsha
the
world
will
never
believe
ye
to
say
nothing
of
the
irish
part
of
it
then
the
world
murtagh
to
say
nothing
of
the
irish
part
of
it
will
be
a
fool
even
as
i
have
often
thought
it
the
grand
thing
murtagh
is
to
be
able
to
believe
oneself
and
respect
oneself
how
few
whom
the
world
believes
believe
and
respect
themselves
och
shorsha
shall
i
go
on
with
the
tale
of
finn
i
rather
you
should
not
murtagh
i
know
all
about
it
already
then
why
did
you
bother
me
to
tell
it
at
first
shorsha
och
it
was
doing
my
ownself
good
and
making
me
forget
my
own
sorrowful
state
when
ye
interrupted
me
with
your
thaives
of
danes
och
shorsha
let
me
tell
you
how
finn
by
means
of
sucking
his
thumb
and
the
witchcraft
he
imbibed
from
it
contrived
to
pull
off
the
arm
of
the
ould
wagabone
darmod
david
odeen
whilst
shaking
hands
with
him
for
finn
could
do
no
feat
of
strength
without
sucking
his
thumb
shorsha
as
conan
the
bald
told
the
son
of
oisin
in
the
song
which
i
used
to
sing
ye
in
dungarvon
times
of
old
and
here
murtagh
repeated
certain
irish
words
to
the
following
effect
o
little
the
foolish
words
i
heed
o
oisin
son
from
thy
lips
which
come
no
strength
were
in
finn
for
valorous
deed
unless
to
the
gristle
he
suck
his
thumb
enough
is
as
good
as
a
feast
murtagh
i
am
no
longer
in
the
cue
for
finn
i
would
rather
hear
your
own
history
now
tell
us
man
all
that
has
happened
to
ye
since
dungarvon
times
of
old
och
shorsha
it
would
be
merely
bringing
all
my
sorrows
back
upon
me
well
if
i
know
all
your
sorrows
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
find
a
help
for
them
i
owe
you
much
murtagh
you
taught
me
irish
and
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
help
you
why
then
shorsha
i
tell
ye
my
history
here
goes
chapter
xlv
murtagh
tale
well
shorsha
about
a
year
and
a
half
after
you
left
us
and
a
sorrowful
hour
for
us
it
was
when
ye
left
us
losing
as
we
did
your
funny
stories
of
your
snake
and
the
battles
of
your
military
they
sent
me
to
paris
and
salamanca
in
order
to
make
a
saggart
of
me
pray
excuse
me
said
i
for
interrupting
you
but
what
kind
of
place
is
salamanca
divil
a
bit
did
i
ever
see
of
it
shorsha
then
why
did
ye
say
ye
were
sent
there
well
what
kind
of
place
is
paris
not
that
i
care
much
about
paris
sorrow
a
bit
did
i
ever
see
of
either
them
shorsha
for
no
one
sent
me
to
either
when
we
says
at
home
a
person
is
going
to
paris
and
salamanca
it
manes
that
he
is
going
abroad
to
study
to
be
a
saggart
whether
he
goes
to
them
places
or
not
no
i
never
saw
either
bad
luck
to
them
i
was
shipped
away
from
cork
up
the
straits
to
a
place
called
leghorn
from
which
i
was
sent
to
to
a
religious
house
where
i
was
to
be
instructed
in
saggarting
till
they
had
made
me
fit
to
cut
a
dacent
figure
in
ireland
we
had
a
long
and
tedious
voyage
shorsha
not
so
tedious
however
as
it
would
have
been
had
i
been
fool
enough
to
lave
your
pack
of
cards
behind
me
as
the
thaif
my
brother
denis
wanted
to
persuade
me
to
do
in
order
that
he
might
play
with
them
himself
with
the
cards
i
managed
to
have
many
a
nice
game
with
the
sailors
winning
from
them
and
sixpences
until
the
captain
said
i
was
ruining
his
men
and
keeping
them
from
their
duty
and
being
a
heretic
and
a
dutchman
swore
that
unless
i
gave
over
he
would
tie
me
up
to
the
mast
and
give
me
a
round
dozen
this
threat
obliged
me
to
be
more
on
my
guard
though
i
occasionally
contrived
to
get
a
game
at
night
and
to
win
sixpennies
and
we
reached
leghorn
at
last
and
glad
i
was
to
leave
the
ship
and
the
master
who
gave
me
a
kick
as
i
was
getting
over
the
side
bad
luck
to
the
dirty
heretic
for
kicking
a
son
of
the
church
for
i
have
always
been
a
true
son
of
the
church
shorsha
and
never
quarrelled
with
it
unless
it
interfered
with
me
in
my
playing
at
cards
i
left
leghorn
with
certain
muleteers
with
whom
i
played
at
cards
at
the
and
who
speedily
won
from
me
all
the
and
sixpences
i
had
won
from
the
sailors
i
got
my
money
worth
however
for
i
learnt
from
the
muleteers
all
kind
of
quaint
tricks
upon
the
cards
which
i
knew
nothing
of
before
so
i
did
not
grudge
them
what
they
chated
me
of
and
when
we
parted
we
did
so
in
kindness
on
both
sides
on
getting
to
i
was
received
into
the
religious
house
for
irishes
it
was
the
irish
house
shorsha
into
which
i
was
taken
for
i
do
not
wish
ye
to
suppose
that
i
was
in
the
english
religious
house
which
there
is
in
that
city
in
which
a
purty
set
are
educated
and
in
which
purty
doings
are
going
on
if
all
tales
be
true
in
this
irish
house
i
commenced
my
studies
learning
to
sing
and
to
read
the
latin
prayers
of
the
church
shorsha
many
the
sorrowful
day
i
passed
in
that
house
learning
the
prayers
and
litanies
being
starved
with
no
earthly
diversion
at
all
at
all
until
i
took
the
cards
out
of
my
chest
and
began
instructing
in
the
chum
which
i
had
with
me
in
my
cell
then
i
had
plenty
of
diversion
along
with
him
during
the
times
when
i
was
not
engaged
in
singing
and
chanting
and
saying
the
prayers
of
the
church
there
was
however
some
drawback
in
playing
with
my
chum
for
though
he
was
very
clever
in
learning
divil
a
sixpence
had
he
to
play
with
in
which
respect
he
was
like
myself
the
master
who
taught
him
who
had
lost
all
my
money
to
the
muleteers
who
taught
me
the
tricks
upon
the
cards
by
degrees
however
it
began
to
be
noised
about
the
religious
house
that
murtagh
from
hibrodary
had
a
pack
of
cards
with
which
he
played
with
his
chum
in
the
cell
whereupon
other
scholars
of
the
religious
house
came
to
me
some
to
be
taught
and
others
to
play
so
with
some
i
played
and
others
i
taught
but
neither
to
those
who
could
play
or
to
those
who
could
not
did
i
teach
the
elegant
tricks
which
i
learnt
from
the
muleteers
well
the
scholars
came
to
me
for
the
sake
of
the
cards
and
the
porter
and
cook
of
the
religious
house
who
could
both
play
very
well
came
also
at
last
i
became
tired
of
playing
for
nothing
so
i
borrowed
a
few
bits
of
silver
from
the
cook
and
played
against
the
porter
and
by
means
of
my
tricks
i
won
money
from
the
porter
and
then
i
paid
the
cook
the
bits
of
silver
which
i
had
borrowed
of
him
and
played
with
him
and
won
a
little
of
his
money
which
i
let
him
win
back
again
as
i
had
lived
long
enough
in
a
religious
house
to
know
that
it
is
dangerous
to
take
money
from
the
cook
in
a
little
time
shorsha
there
was
scarcely
anything
going
on
in
the
house
but
the
almoner
played
with
me
and
so
did
the
rector
and
i
won
money
from
both
not
too
much
however
lest
they
should
tell
the
rector
who
had
the
character
of
a
very
austere
man
and
of
being
a
bit
of
a
saint
however
the
thief
of
a
porter
whose
money
i
had
won
informed
the
rector
of
what
was
going
on
and
one
day
the
rector
sent
for
me
into
his
private
apartment
and
gave
me
so
long
and
pious
a
lecture
upon
the
heinous
sin
of
that
i
thought
i
should
sink
into
the
ground
after
about
inveighing
against
playing
he
began
to
soften
his
tone
and
with
a
long
sigh
told
me
that
at
one
time
of
his
life
he
had
been
a
young
man
himself
and
had
occasionally
used
the
cards
he
then
began
to
ask
me
some
questions
about
which
questions
i
afterwards
found
were
to
pump
from
me
what
i
knew
about
the
science
after
a
time
he
asked
me
whether
i
had
got
my
cards
with
me
and
on
my
telling
him
i
had
he
expressed
a
wish
to
see
them
whereupon
i
took
the
pack
out
of
my
pocket
and
showed
it
to
him
he
looked
at
it
very
attentively
and
at
last
giving
another
deep
sigh
he
said
that
though
he
was
nearly
weaned
from
the
vanities
of
the
world
he
had
still
an
inclination
to
see
whether
he
had
entirely
lost
the
little
skill
which
at
one
time
he
possessed
when
i
heard
him
speak
in
this
manner
i
told
him
that
if
his
reverence
was
inclined
for
a
game
of
cards
i
should
be
very
happy
to
play
one
with
him
scarcely
had
i
uttered
these
words
than
he
gave
a
third
sigh
and
looked
so
very
much
like
a
saint
that
i
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
excommunicate
me
nothing
of
the
kind
however
for
presently
he
gets
up
and
locks
the
door
then
sitting
down
at
the
table
he
motioned
me
to
do
the
same
which
i
did
and
in
five
minutes
we
were
playing
at
cards
his
reverence
and
myself
i
soon
found
that
his
reverence
knew
quite
as
much
about
as
i
did
divil
a
trick
was
there
connected
with
cards
that
his
reverence
did
not
seem
awake
to
as
however
we
were
not
playing
for
money
this
circumstance
did
not
give
me
much
uneasiness
so
we
played
game
after
game
for
two
hours
when
his
reverence
having
business
told
me
i
might
go
so
i
took
up
my
cards
make
my
obedience
and
left
him
the
next
day
i
had
other
games
with
him
and
so
on
for
a
very
long
time
still
playing
for
nothing
at
last
his
reverence
grew
tired
of
playing
for
nothing
and
proposed
that
we
should
play
for
money
now
i
had
no
desire
to
play
with
his
reverence
for
money
as
i
knew
that
doing
so
would
bring
on
a
quarrel
as
long
as
we
were
playing
for
nothing
i
could
afford
to
let
his
reverence
use
what
tricks
he
pleased
but
if
we
played
for
money
i
could
do
so
if
he
played
his
tricks
i
must
play
mine
and
use
every
advantage
to
save
my
money
and
there
was
one
i
possessed
which
his
reverence
did
not
the
cards
being
my
own
i
had
put
some
delicate
little
marks
on
the
trump
cards
just
at
the
edges
so
that
when
i
dealt
by
means
of
a
little
sleight
of
hand
i
could
deal
myself
any
trump
card
i
pleased
but
i
wished
as
i
said
before
to
have
no
dealings
for
money
with
his
reverence
knowing
that
he
was
master
in
the
house
and
that
he
could
lead
me
a
dog
of
a
life
if
i
offended
him
either
by
winning
his
money
or
not
letting
him
win
mine
so
i
told
him
i
had
no
money
to
play
with
but
the
ould
thief
knew
better
he
knew
that
i
was
every
day
winning
money
from
the
scholars
and
the
and
the
other
people
of
the
house
and
the
ould
thaif
had
determined
to
let
me
go
on
in
that
way
winning
money
and
then
by
means
of
his
tricks
which
he
thought
i
dare
not
resent
to
win
from
me
all
my
earnings
in
a
word
shorsha
to
let
me
fill
myself
like
a
sponge
and
then
squeeze
me
for
his
own
advantage
so
he
made
me
play
with
him
and
in
less
than
three
days
came
on
the
quarrel
his
reverence
chated
me
and
i
chated
his
reverence
the
ould
thaif
knew
every
trick
that
i
knew
and
one
or
two
more
but
in
daling
out
the
cards
i
nicked
his
reverence
scarcely
a
trump
did
i
ever
give
him
shorsha
and
won
his
money
purty
freely
och
it
was
a
purty
quarrel
all
the
delicate
names
in
the
calendar
if
ye
ever
heard
of
such
a
book
all
the
names
in
the
newgate
histories
and
the
lives
of
irish
rogues
did
we
call
each
other
his
reverence
and
i
suddenly
however
putting
out
his
hand
he
seized
the
cards
saying
will
examine
these
cards
ye
cheating
scoundrel
for
i
believe
there
are
dirty
marks
on
them
which
ye
have
made
in
order
to
know
the
winning
cards
me
back
my
pack
said
i
on
dioul
if
i
be
not
the
death
of
ye
his
reverence
however
clapped
the
cards
into
his
pocket
and
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
door
i
hanging
upon
him
he
was
a
gross
fat
man
but
like
most
fat
men
deadly
strong
so
he
forced
his
way
to
the
door
and
opening
it
flung
himself
out
with
me
still
holding
on
him
like
a
terrier
dog
on
a
big
fat
pig
then
he
shouts
for
help
and
in
a
little
time
i
was
secured
and
thrust
into
a
room
where
i
was
left
to
myself
here
was
a
purty
alteration
yesterday
i
was
the
idol
of
the
religious
house
thought
more
on
than
his
reverence
every
one
paying
me
court
and
wurtship
and
wanting
to
play
cards
with
me
and
to
learn
my
tricks
and
fed
moreover
on
the
tidbits
of
the
table
and
i
was
in
a
cell
nobody
coming
to
look
at
me
but
the
blackguard
porter
who
had
charge
of
me
my
cards
taken
from
me
and
with
nothing
but
bread
and
water
to
live
upon
time
passed
dreary
enough
for
a
month
at
the
end
of
which
time
his
reverence
came
to
me
leaving
the
porter
just
outside
the
door
in
order
to
come
to
his
help
should
i
be
violent
and
then
he
read
me
a
very
purty
lecture
on
my
conduct
saying
i
had
turned
the
religious
house
and
corrupted
the
scholars
and
that
i
was
the
cheat
of
the
world
for
that
on
inspecting
the
pack
he
had
discovered
the
dirty
marks
which
i
had
made
upon
the
trump
cards
for
to
know
them
by
he
said
a
great
deal
more
to
me
which
is
not
worth
relating
and
ended
by
telling
me
that
he
intended
to
let
me
out
of
confinement
next
day
but
that
if
ever
i
misconducted
myself
any
more
he
would
clap
me
in
again
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
had
a
good
mind
to
call
him
an
ould
thaif
but
the
hope
of
getting
out
made
me
hold
my
tongue
and
the
next
day
i
was
let
out
and
need
enough
i
had
to
be
let
out
for
what
with
being
alone
and
living
on
bread
and
water
i
was
becoming
frighted
or
as
the
doctors
call
it
narvous
but
when
i
was
out
oh
what
a
change
i
found
in
the
religious
house
no
for
it
had
been
forbidden
to
the
scholars
and
there
was
now
nothing
going
on
but
reading
and
singing
divil
a
merry
visage
to
be
seen
but
plenty
of
prim
airs
and
graces
but
the
case
of
the
scholars
though
bad
enough
was
not
half
so
bad
as
mine
for
they
could
spake
to
each
other
whereas
i
could
not
have
a
word
of
conversation
for
the
ould
thaif
of
a
rector
had
ordered
them
to
send
me
to
telling
them
that
i
was
a
gambling
cheat
with
morals
bad
enough
to
corrupt
a
horse
regiment
and
whereas
they
were
allowed
to
divert
themselves
with
going
out
i
was
kept
reading
and
singing
from
morn
till
night
the
only
soul
who
was
willing
to
exchange
a
word
with
me
was
the
cook
and
sometimes
he
and
i
had
a
little
bit
of
discourse
in
a
corner
and
we
condoled
with
each
other
for
he
liked
the
change
in
the
religious
house
almost
as
little
as
myself
but
he
told
me
that
for
all
the
change
below
stairs
there
was
still
on
above
for
that
the
ould
thaif
of
a
rector
and
the
rector
and
the
almoner
played
at
cards
together
and
that
the
rector
won
money
from
the
others
the
almoner
had
told
him
so
and
moreover
that
the
rector
was
the
thaif
of
the
world
and
had
once
been
kicked
out
of
a
at
dublin
for
cheating
at
cards
and
after
that
circumstance
had
apparently
reformed
and
lived
decently
till
the
time
when
i
came
to
the
religious
house
with
my
pack
but
that
the
sight
of
that
had
brought
him
back
to
his
ould
gambling
he
told
the
cook
moreover
that
the
rector
frequently
went
out
at
night
to
the
houses
of
the
great
clergy
and
cheated
at
cards
in
this
melancholy
state
with
respect
to
myself
things
continued
a
long
time
when
suddenly
there
was
a
report
that
his
holiness
the
pope
intended
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
religious
house
in
order
to
examine
into
its
discipline
when
i
heard
this
i
was
glad
for
i
determined
after
the
pope
had
done
what
he
had
come
to
do
to
fall
upon
my
knees
before
him
and
make
a
regular
complaint
of
the
treatment
i
had
received
to
tell
him
of
the
cheating
at
cards
of
the
rector
and
to
beg
him
to
make
the
ould
thaif
give
me
back
my
pack
again
so
the
day
of
the
visit
came
and
his
holiness
made
his
appearance
with
his
attendants
and
having
looked
over
the
religious
house
he
went
into
the
rector
room
with
the
rector
the
and
the
almoner
i
intended
to
have
waited
until
his
holiness
came
out
but
finding
he
stayed
a
long
time
i
thought
i
would
go
into
him
so
i
went
up
to
the
door
without
anybody
observing
me
his
attendants
being
walking
about
the
corridor
and
opening
it
i
slipped
in
and
there
what
do
you
think
i
saw
why
his
holiness
the
pope
and
his
reverence
the
rector
and
the
and
the
almoner
seated
at
cards
and
the
ould
thaif
of
a
rector
was
dealing
out
the
cards
which
ye
had
given
me
shorsha
to
his
holiness
the
pope
the
the
almoner
and
himself
in
this
part
of
his
history
i
interrupted
murtagh
saying
that
i
was
afraid
he
was
telling
untruths
and
that
it
was
highly
improbable
that
the
pope
would
leave
the
vatican
to
play
cards
with
irish
at
their
religious
house
and
that
i
was
sure
if
on
his
murtagh
authority
i
were
to
tell
the
world
so
the
world
would
never
believe
it
then
the
world
shorsha
would
be
a
fool
even
as
you
were
just
now
saying
you
had
frequently
believed
it
to
be
the
grand
thing
shorsha
is
to
be
able
to
believe
oneself
if
ye
can
do
that
it
matters
very
little
whether
the
world
believe
ye
or
no
but
a
purty
thing
for
you
and
the
world
to
stickle
at
the
pope
playing
at
cards
at
a
religious
house
of
irish
och
if
i
were
to
tell
you
and
the
world
what
the
pope
has
been
sometimes
at
at
the
religious
house
of
english
thaives
i
would
excuse
you
and
the
world
for
turning
up
your
eyes
however
i
wish
to
say
nothing
against
the
pope
i
am
a
son
of
the
church
and
if
the
pope
do
interfere
with
my
cards
divil
a
bit
will
i
have
to
say
against
him
but
i
saw
the
pope
playing
or
about
to
play
with
the
pack
which
had
been
taken
from
me
and
when
i
told
the
pope
the
pope
did
not
ye
had
better
let
me
go
on
with
my
history
shorsha
whether
you
or
the
world
believe
it
or
not
i
am
sure
it
is
quite
as
true
as
your
tale
of
the
snake
or
saying
that
finn
got
his
burnt
finger
from
the
thaives
of
loughlin
and
whatever
you
may
say
i
am
sure
the
world
will
think
so
too
i
apologized
to
murtagh
for
interrupting
him
and
telling
him
that
his
history
whether
true
or
not
was
infinitely
diverting
begged
him
to
continue
it
chapter
xlvi
murtagh
story
continued
the
priest
exorcist
and
how
to
check
a
rebellion
i
was
telling
ye
shorsha
when
ye
interrupted
me
that
i
found
the
pope
the
rector
the
and
the
almoner
seated
at
the
table
the
rector
with
my
pack
of
cards
in
his
hands
about
to
deal
out
to
the
pope
and
the
rest
not
forgetting
himself
for
whom
he
intended
all
the
cards
no
doubt
no
sooner
did
they
perceive
me
than
they
seemed
taken
all
aback
but
the
rector
suddenly
starting
up
with
the
cards
in
his
hand
asked
me
what
i
did
there
threatening
to
have
me
well
disciplined
if
i
did
not
go
about
my
business
am
come
for
my
pack
said
i
ould
thaif
and
to
tell
his
holiness
how
i
have
been
treated
by
ye
then
going
down
on
my
knees
before
his
holiness
i
said
now
your
holiness
will
ye
not
see
justice
done
to
a
poor
boy
who
has
been
sadly
misused
the
pack
of
cards
which
that
old
ruffian
has
in
his
hand
are
my
cards
which
he
has
taken
from
me
in
order
to
chate
with
arrah
play
with
him
your
holiness
for
he
only
chate
ye
there
are
dirty
marks
upon
the
cards
which
bear
the
trumps
put
there
in
order
to
know
them
by
and
the
ould
thaif
in
daling
out
will
give
himself
all
the
good
cards
and
chate
ye
of
the
last
farthing
in
your
pocket
so
let
them
be
taken
from
him
your
holiness
and
given
back
to
me
and
order
him
to
lave
the
room
and
then
if
your
holiness
be
for
an
honest
game
think
i
am
the
boy
to
baulk
ye
i
take
the
old
ruffian
place
and
play
with
ye
till
evening
and
all
night
besides
and
divil
an
advantage
will
i
take
of
the
dirty
marks
though
i
know
them
all
having
placed
them
on
the
cards
myself
i
was
going
on
in
this
way
when
the
ould
thaif
of
a
rector
flinging
down
the
cards
made
at
me
as
if
to
kick
me
out
of
the
room
whereupon
i
started
up
and
said
ye
are
for
kicking
sure
two
can
play
at
that
and
then
i
kicked
at
his
reverence
and
his
reverence
at
me
and
there
was
a
regular
scrimmage
between
us
which
frightened
the
pope
who
getting
up
said
some
words
which
i
did
not
understand
but
which
the
cook
afterwards
told
me
were
extravagance
and
this
is
the
second
edition
for
it
seems
that
a
little
time
before
his
holiness
had
been
frightened
in
church
by
the
servant
of
an
english
family
which
those
thaives
of
the
english
religious
house
had
been
endeavouring
to
bring
over
to
the
catholic
faith
and
who
did
approve
of
their
being
converted
och
his
holiness
did
us
all
sore
injustice
to
call
us
english
and
to
confound
our
house
with
the
other
for
however
dirty
our
house
might
be
our
house
was
a
clane
house
compared
with
the
english
house
and
we
honest
people
compared
with
those
english
thaives
well
his
holiness
was
frighted
and
the
almoner
ran
out
and
brought
in
his
attendants
and
they
laid
hold
of
me
but
i
struggled
hard
and
said
will
not
go
without
my
pack
arrah
your
holiness
make
them
give
me
my
pack
which
shorsha
gave
me
in
dungarvon
times
of
old
but
my
struggles
were
of
no
use
i
was
pulled
away
and
put
out
in
the
ould
dungeon
and
his
holiness
went
away
sore
frighted
crossing
himself
much
and
never
returned
again
in
the
old
dungeon
i
was
fastened
to
the
wall
by
a
chain
and
there
i
was
disciplined
once
every
other
day
for
the
first
three
weeks
and
then
i
was
left
to
myself
and
my
chain
and
hunger
and
there
i
sat
in
the
dungeon
sometimes
screeching
sometimes
hallooing
for
i
soon
became
frighted
having
nothing
in
the
cell
to
divert
me
at
last
the
cook
found
his
way
to
me
by
stealth
and
comforted
me
a
little
bringing
me
tidbits
out
of
the
kitchen
and
he
visited
me
again
and
again
not
often
however
for
he
dare
only
come
when
he
could
steal
away
the
key
from
the
custody
of
the
thaif
of
a
porter
i
was
three
years
in
the
dungeon
and
should
have
gone
mad
but
for
the
cook
and
his
words
of
comfort
and
his
tidbits
and
nice
books
which
he
brought
me
out
of
the
library
which
were
the
of
newgate
and
the
of
irish
rogues
and
raparees
the
only
english
books
in
the
library
however
at
the
end
of
three
years
the
ould
thaif
of
a
rector
wishing
to
look
at
them
books
missed
them
from
the
library
and
made
a
perquisition
about
them
and
the
thaif
of
a
porter
said
that
he
should
wonder
if
i
had
them
saying
that
he
had
once
seen
me
reading
and
then
the
rector
came
with
others
to
my
cell
and
took
my
books
from
me
from
under
my
straw
and
asked
me
how
i
came
by
them
and
on
my
refusal
to
tell
they
disciplined
me
again
till
the
blood
ran
down
my
back
and
making
more
perquisition
they
at
last
accused
the
cook
of
having
carried
the
books
to
me
and
not
denying
he
was
given
warning
to
leave
next
day
but
he
left
that
night
and
took
me
away
with
him
for
he
stole
the
key
and
came
to
me
and
cut
my
chain
through
and
then
he
and
i
escaped
from
the
religious
house
through
a
window
the
cook
with
a
bundle
containing
what
things
he
had
no
sooner
had
we
got
out
than
the
honest
cook
gave
me
a
little
bit
of
money
and
a
loaf
and
told
me
to
follow
a
way
which
he
pointed
out
which
he
said
would
lead
to
the
sea
and
then
having
embraced
me
after
the
italian
way
he
left
me
and
i
never
saw
him
again
so
i
followed
the
way
which
the
cook
pointed
out
and
in
two
days
reached
a
seaport
called
chiviter
vik
terribly
and
there
i
met
a
sailor
who
spoke
irish
and
who
belonged
to
a
vessel
just
ready
to
sail
for
france
and
the
sailor
took
me
on
board
his
vessel
and
said
i
was
his
brother
and
the
captain
gave
me
a
passage
to
a
place
in
france
called
marseilles
and
when
i
got
there
the
captain
and
sailor
got
a
little
money
for
me
and
a
passport
and
i
travelled
across
the
country
towards
a
place
they
directed
me
to
called
bayonne
from
which
they
said
i
might
perhaps
get
to
ireland
coming
however
to
a
place
called
pau
all
my
money
being
gone
i
enlisted
into
a
regiment
called
the
army
of
the
faith
which
was
going
into
spain
for
the
king
of
spain
had
been
dethroned
and
imprisoned
by
his
own
subjects
as
perhaps
you
may
have
heard
and
the
king
of
france
who
was
his
cousin
was
sending
an
army
to
help
him
under
the
command
of
his
own
son
whom
the
english
called
prince
hilt
because
when
he
was
told
that
he
was
appointed
to
the
command
he
clapped
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
so
i
enlisted
into
the
regiment
of
the
faith
which
was
made
up
of
spaniards
many
of
them
priests
who
had
run
out
of
spain
and
broken
germans
and
irish
like
myself
it
was
said
to
be
a
blackguard
regiment
that
same
regiment
of
the
faith
but
i
saw
nothing
blackguardly
going
on
in
it
for
you
would
hardly
reckon
and
dominoes
and
pitch
and
toss
blackguardly
and
i
saw
nothing
else
in
it
there
was
one
thing
in
it
which
i
disliked
the
priests
drawing
their
spanish
knives
occasionally
when
they
lost
their
money
after
we
had
been
some
time
at
pau
the
army
of
the
faith
was
sent
across
the
mountains
into
spain
as
the
vanguard
of
the
french
and
no
sooner
did
the
spaniards
see
the
faith
than
they
made
a
dash
at
it
and
the
faith
ran
away
myself
along
with
it
and
got
behind
the
french
army
which
told
it
to
keep
there
and
the
faith
did
so
and
followed
the
french
army
which
soon
scattered
the
spaniards
and
in
the
end
placed
the
king
on
his
throne
again
when
the
war
was
over
the
faith
was
disbanded
some
of
the
foreigners
however
amongst
whom
i
was
one
were
put
into
a
guard
regiment
and
there
i
continued
for
more
than
a
year
one
day
being
at
a
place
called
the
escurial
i
took
stock
as
the
tradesmen
say
and
found
i
possessed
the
sum
of
eighty
dollars
won
by
playing
at
cards
for
though
i
could
not
play
so
well
with
the
foreign
cards
as
with
the
pack
you
gave
me
shorsha
i
had
yet
contrived
to
win
money
from
the
priests
and
soldiers
of
the
faith
finding
myself
possessed
of
such
a
capital
i
determined
to
leave
the
service
and
to
make
the
best
of
my
way
to
ireland
so
i
deserted
but
coming
in
an
evil
hour
to
a
place
they
calls
torre
lodones
i
found
the
priest
playing
at
cards
with
his
parishioners
the
sight
of
the
cards
made
me
stop
and
then
fool
like
notwithstanding
the
treasure
i
had
about
me
i
must
wish
to
play
so
not
being
able
to
speak
their
language
i
made
signs
to
them
to
let
me
play
and
the
priest
and
his
thaives
consented
willingly
so
i
sat
down
to
cards
with
the
priest
and
two
of
his
parishioners
and
in
a
little
time
had
won
plenty
of
their
money
but
i
had
better
never
have
done
any
such
thing
for
suddenly
the
priest
and
all
his
parishioners
set
upon
me
and
bate
me
and
took
from
me
all
i
had
and
cast
me
out
of
the
village
more
dead
than
alive
och
it
a
bad
village
that
and
if
i
had
known
what
it
was
i
would
have
avoided
it
or
run
straight
through
it
though
i
saw
all
the
in
the
world
going
on
in
it
there
is
a
proverb
about
it
as
i
was
afterwards
told
old
as
the
time
of
the
moors
which
holds
good
to
the
present
day
it
is
that
in
torre
lodones
there
are
housekeepers
and
thieves
maning
that
all
the
people
are
thaives
and
the
clergyman
to
boot
who
is
not
reckoned
a
housekeeper
and
troth
i
found
the
clergyman
the
greatest
thaif
of
the
lot
after
being
cast
out
of
that
village
i
travelled
for
nearly
a
month
subsisting
by
begging
tolerably
well
for
though
most
of
the
spanish
are
thaives
they
are
rather
charitable
but
though
charitable
thaives
they
do
not
like
their
own
being
taken
from
them
without
leave
being
asked
as
i
found
to
my
cost
for
on
my
entering
a
garden
near
seville
without
leave
to
take
an
orange
the
labourer
came
running
up
and
struck
me
to
the
ground
with
a
hatchet
giving
me
a
big
wound
in
the
arm
i
fainted
with
loss
of
blood
and
on
reviving
i
found
myself
in
a
hospital
at
seville
to
which
the
labourer
and
the
people
of
the
village
had
taken
me
i
should
have
died
of
starvation
in
that
hospital
had
not
some
english
people
heard
of
me
and
come
to
see
me
they
tended
me
with
food
till
i
was
cured
and
then
paid
my
passage
on
board
a
ship
to
london
to
which
place
the
ship
carried
me
and
now
i
was
in
london
with
five
shillings
in
my
pocket
all
i
had
in
the
world
and
that
did
not
last
for
long
and
when
it
was
gone
i
begged
in
the
streets
but
i
did
not
get
much
by
that
except
a
month
hard
labour
in
the
and
when
i
came
out
i
knew
not
what
to
do
but
thought
i
would
take
a
walk
in
the
country
for
it
was
time
and
the
weather
was
fine
so
i
took
a
walk
about
seven
miles
from
london
and
came
to
a
place
where
a
great
fair
was
being
held
and
there
i
begged
but
got
nothing
but
a
halfpenny
and
was
thinking
of
going
farther
when
i
saw
a
man
with
a
table
like
that
of
mine
playing
with
thimbles
as
you
saw
me
i
looked
at
the
play
and
saw
him
win
money
and
run
away
and
hunted
by
constables
more
than
once
i
kept
following
the
man
and
at
last
entered
into
conversation
with
him
and
learning
from
him
that
he
was
in
want
of
a
companion
to
help
him
i
offered
to
help
him
if
he
would
pay
me
he
looked
at
me
from
top
to
toe
and
did
not
wish
at
first
to
have
anything
to
do
with
me
as
he
said
my
appearance
was
against
me
shorsha
he
had
better
have
looked
at
home
for
his
appearance
was
not
much
in
his
favour
he
looked
very
much
like
a
jew
shorsha
however
he
at
last
agreed
to
take
me
to
be
his
companion
or
bonnet
as
he
called
it
and
i
was
to
keep
a
and
let
him
know
when
constables
were
coming
and
to
spake
a
good
word
for
him
occasionally
whilst
he
was
chating
folks
with
his
thimbles
and
his
pea
so
i
became
his
bonnet
and
assisted
him
in
the
fair
and
in
many
other
fairs
beside
but
i
did
not
like
my
occupation
much
or
rather
my
master
who
though
not
a
big
man
was
a
big
thaif
and
an
unkind
one
for
do
all
i
could
i
could
never
give
him
pleasure
and
he
was
continually
calling
me
fool
and
bogtrotter
and
twitting
me
because
i
could
not
learn
his
thaives
latin
and
discourse
with
him
in
it
and
comparing
me
with
another
acquaintance
or
bit
of
a
pal
of
his
whom
he
said
he
had
parted
with
in
the
fair
and
of
whom
he
was
fond
of
saying
all
kinds
of
wonderful
things
amongst
others
that
he
knew
the
grammar
of
all
tongues
at
last
wearied
with
being
twitted
by
him
with
not
being
able
to
learn
his
thaives
greek
i
proposed
that
i
should
teach
him
irish
that
we
should
spake
it
together
when
we
had
anything
to
say
in
secret
to
that
he
consented
willingly
but
och
a
purty
hand
he
made
with
irish
not
much
better
than
i
did
with
his
thaives
hebrew
then
my
turn
came
and
i
twitted
him
nicely
with
dulness
and
compared
him
with
a
pal
that
i
had
in
ould
ireland
in
dungarvon
times
of
yore
to
whom
i
teached
irish
telling
him
that
he
was
the
broth
of
a
boy
and
not
only
knew
the
grammar
of
all
human
tongues
but
the
dialects
of
the
snakes
besides
in
fact
i
tould
him
all
about
your
own
sweet
self
shorsha
and
many
a
dispute
and
quarrel
had
we
together
about
our
pals
which
was
the
cleverest
fellow
his
or
mine
well
after
having
been
wid
him
about
two
months
i
quitted
him
without
noise
taking
away
one
of
his
tables
and
some
peas
and
thimbles
and
that
i
did
with
a
safe
conscience
for
he
paid
me
nothing
and
was
not
over
free
with
the
meat
and
the
drink
though
i
must
say
of
him
that
he
was
a
clever
fellow
and
perfect
master
of
his
trade
by
which
he
made
a
power
of
money
and
bating
his
not
being
able
to
learn
irish
and
a
certain
jewish
lisp
which
he
had
a
great
master
of
his
tongue
of
which
he
was
very
proud
so
much
so
that
he
once
told
me
that
when
he
had
saved
a
certain
sum
of
money
he
meant
to
leave
off
the
thimbling
business
and
enter
parliament
into
which
he
said
he
could
get
at
any
time
through
the
interest
of
a
friend
of
his
a
tory
peer
my
lord
whitefeather
with
whom
he
said
he
had
occasionally
done
business
with
the
table
and
other
things
which
i
had
taken
i
commenced
trade
on
my
own
account
having
contrived
to
learn
a
few
of
his
tricks
my
only
capital
was
the
change
for
which
he
had
once
let
fall
and
which
i
picked
up
which
was
all
i
could
ever
get
from
him
for
it
was
impossible
to
stale
any
money
from
him
he
was
so
awake
being
up
to
all
the
tricks
of
thaives
having
followed
the
diving
trade
as
he
called
it
for
a
considerable
time
my
wish
was
to
make
enough
by
my
table
to
enable
me
to
return
with
credit
to
ould
ireland
where
i
had
no
doubt
of
being
able
to
get
myself
ordained
as
priest
and
in
troth
notwithstanding
i
was
a
beginner
and
without
any
companion
to
help
me
i
did
tolerably
well
getting
my
meat
and
drink
and
increasing
my
small
capital
till
i
came
to
this
unlucky
place
of
horncastle
where
i
was
utterly
ruined
by
the
thaif
in
the
rider
dress
and
now
shorsha
i
am
after
telling
you
my
history
perhaps
you
will
now
be
telling
me
something
about
yourself
i
told
murtagh
all
about
myself
that
i
deemed
necessary
to
relate
and
then
asked
him
what
he
intended
to
do
he
repeated
that
he
was
utterly
ruined
and
that
he
had
no
prospect
before
him
but
starving
or
making
away
with
himself
i
inquired
how
much
would
take
him
to
ireland
and
establish
him
there
with
credit
five
pounds
he
answered
adding
but
who
in
the
world
would
be
fool
enough
to
lend
me
five
pounds
unless
it
be
yourself
shorsha
who
may
be
have
not
got
it
for
when
you
told
me
about
yourself
you
made
no
boast
of
the
state
of
your
affairs
i
am
not
very
rich
i
replied
but
i
think
i
can
accommodate
you
with
what
you
want
i
consider
myself
under
great
obligations
to
you
murtagh
it
was
you
who
instructed
me
in
the
language
of
oilein
nan
naomha
which
has
been
the
foundation
of
all
my
acquisitions
in
philology
without
you
i
should
not
have
been
what
i
am
lavengro
which
signifies
a
philologist
here
is
the
money
murtagh
said
i
putting
my
hand
into
my
pocket
and
taking
out
five
pounds
much
good
may
it
do
you
he
took
the
money
stared
at
it
and
then
at
me
and
you
mane
to
give
me
this
shorsha
it
is
no
longer
mine
to
give
said
i
it
is
yours
and
you
give
it
me
for
the
gratitude
you
bear
me
yes
said
i
and
for
dungarvon
times
of
old
well
shorsha
said
he
you
are
a
broth
of
a
boy
and
i
take
your
benefaction
five
pounds
och
jasus
he
then
put
the
money
in
his
pocket
and
springing
up
waved
his
hat
three
times
uttering
some
old
irish
cry
then
sitting
down
he
took
my
hand
and
said
sure
shorsha
i
be
going
thither
and
when
i
get
there
it
is
turning
over
another
leaf
i
will
be
i
have
learnt
a
thing
or
two
abroad
i
will
become
a
priest
that
the
trade
shorsha
and
i
will
cry
out
for
repale
that
the
cry
shorsha
and
i
be
a
fool
no
longer
and
what
will
you
do
with
your
table
said
i
be
taking
it
with
me
shorsha
and
when
i
gets
to
ireland
i
get
it
mended
and
i
will
keep
it
in
the
house
which
i
shall
have
and
when
i
looks
upon
it
i
will
be
thinking
of
all
i
have
undergone
you
had
better
leave
it
behind
you
said
i
if
you
take
it
with
you
you
will
perhaps
take
up
the
thimble
trade
again
before
you
get
to
ireland
and
lose
the
money
i
am
after
giving
you
no
fear
of
that
shorsha
never
will
i
play
on
that
table
again
shorsha
till
i
get
it
mended
which
shall
not
be
till
i
am
a
priest
and
have
a
house
in
which
to
place
it
murtagh
and
i
then
went
into
the
town
where
we
had
some
refreshment
together
and
then
parted
on
our
several
ways
i
heard
nothing
of
him
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
when
a
person
who
knew
him
well
coming
from
ireland
and
staying
at
my
humble
house
told
me
a
great
deal
about
him
he
reached
ireland
in
safety
soon
reconciled
himself
with
his
church
and
was
ordained
a
priest
in
the
priestly
office
he
acquitted
himself
in
a
way
very
satisfactory
upon
the
whole
to
his
superiors
having
as
he
frequently
said
learned
wisdom
abroad
the
popish
church
never
fails
to
turn
to
account
any
particular
gift
which
its
servants
may
possess
and
discovering
soon
that
murtagh
was
endowed
with
considerable
manual
dexterity
proof
of
which
he
frequently
gave
at
cards
and
at
a
singular
game
which
he
occasionally
played
at
thimbles
it
selected
him
as
a
very
fit
person
to
play
the
part
of
exorcist
and
accordingly
he
travelled
through
a
great
part
of
ireland
casting
out
devils
from
people
possessed
which
he
afterwards
exhibited
sometimes
in
the
shape
of
rabbits
and
occasionally
birds
and
fishes
there
is
a
holy
island
in
a
lake
in
ireland
to
which
the
people
resort
at
a
particular
season
of
the
year
here
murtagh
frequently
attended
and
it
was
here
that
he
performed
a
cure
which
will
cause
his
name
long
to
be
remembered
in
ireland
delivering
a
possessed
woman
of
two
demons
which
he
brandished
aloft
in
his
hands
in
the
shape
of
two
large
eels
and
subsequently
hurled
into
the
lake
amidst
the
shouts
of
an
enthusiastic
multitude
besides
playing
the
part
of
an
exorcist
he
acted
that
of
a
politician
with
considerable
success
he
attached
himself
to
the
party
of
the
sire
of
agitation
the
man
of
paunch
and
preached
and
hallooed
for
repeal
with
the
loudest
and
best
as
long
as
repeal
was
the
cry
as
soon
however
as
the
whigs
attained
the
helm
of
government
and
the
greater
part
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
more
politely
termed
the
patronage
of
ireland
was
placed
at
the
disposition
of
the
priesthood
the
tone
of
murtagh
like
that
of
the
rest
of
his
brother
saggarts
was
considerably
softened
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
declare
that
politics
were
not
altogether
consistent
with
sacerdotal
duty
and
resuming
his
exorcisms
which
he
had
for
some
time
abandoned
he
went
to
the
isle
of
holiness
and
delivered
a
possessed
woman
of
six
demons
in
the
shape
of
white
mice
he
however
again
resumed
the
political
mantle
in
the
year
during
the
short
period
of
the
rebellion
of
the
young
irelanders
the
priests
though
they
apparently
sided
with
this
party
did
not
approve
of
it
as
it
was
chiefly
formed
of
ardent
young
men
fond
of
what
they
termed
liberty
and
by
no
means
admirers
of
priestly
domination
being
mostly
protestants
just
before
the
outbreak
of
this
rebellion
it
was
determined
between
the
priests
and
the
that
this
party
should
be
rendered
comparatively
innocuous
by
being
deprived
of
the
sinews
of
war
in
other
words
certain
sums
of
money
which
they
had
raised
for
their
enterprise
murtagh
was
deemed
the
best
qualified
person
in
ireland
to
be
entrusted
with
the
delicate
office
of
getting
their
money
from
them
having
received
his
instructions
he
invited
the
leaders
to
his
parsonage
amongst
the
mountains
under
pretence
of
deliberating
with
them
about
what
was
to
be
done
they
arrived
there
just
before
nightfall
dressed
in
red
yellow
and
green
the
colours
so
dear
to
enthusiastic
irishmen
murtagh
received
them
with
great
apparent
cordiality
and
entered
into
a
long
discourse
with
them
promising
them
the
assistance
of
himself
and
order
and
received
from
them
a
profusion
of
thanks
after
a
time
murtagh
observing
in
a
jocular
tone
that
consulting
was
dull
work
proposed
a
game
of
cards
and
the
leaders
though
somewhat
surprised
assenting
he
went
to
a
closet
and
taking
out
a
pack
of
cards
laid
it
upon
the
table
it
was
a
strange
dirty
pack
and
exhibited
every
mark
of
having
seen
very
long
service
on
one
of
its
guests
making
some
remarks
on
the
ancientness
of
its
appearance
murtagh
observed
that
there
was
a
very
wonderful
history
attached
to
that
pack
it
had
been
presented
to
him
he
said
by
a
young
gentleman
a
disciple
of
his
to
whom
in
dungarvon
times
of
yore
he
had
taught
the
irish
language
and
of
whom
he
related
some
very
extraordinary
things
he
added
that
he
murtagh
had
taken
it
to
where
it
had
once
the
happiness
of
being
in
the
hands
of
the
holy
father
by
a
great
misfortune
he
did
not
say
what
he
had
lost
possession
of
it
and
had
returned
without
it
but
had
some
time
since
recovered
it
a
nephew
of
his
who
was
being
educated
at
for
a
priest
having
found
it
in
a
nook
of
the
college
and
sent
it
to
him
murtagh
and
the
leaders
then
played
various
games
with
this
pack
more
especially
one
called
by
the
initiated
blind
hookey
the
result
being
that
at
the
end
of
about
two
hours
the
leaders
found
they
had
lost
half
of
their
funds
they
now
looked
serious
and
talked
of
leaving
the
house
but
murtagh
begging
them
to
stay
to
supper
they
consented
after
supper
at
which
the
guests
drank
rather
freely
murtagh
said
that
as
he
had
not
the
least
wish
to
win
their
money
he
intended
to
give
them
their
revenge
he
would
not
play
at
cards
with
them
he
added
but
at
a
funny
game
of
thimbles
at
which
they
would
be
sure
of
winning
back
their
own
then
going
out
he
brought
in
a
table
tall
and
narrow
on
which
placing
certain
thimbles
and
a
pea
he
proposed
that
they
should
stake
whatever
they
pleased
on
the
almost
certainty
of
finding
the
pea
under
the
thimbles
the
leaders
after
some
hesitation
consented
and
were
at
first
eminently
successful
winning
back
the
greater
part
of
what
they
had
lost
after
some
time
however
fortune
or
rather
murtagh
turned
against
them
and
then
instead
of
leaving
off
they
doubled
and
trebled
their
stakes
and
continued
doing
so
until
they
had
lost
nearly
the
whole
of
their
funds
quite
furious
they
now
swore
that
murtagh
had
cheated
them
and
insisted
on
having
their
property
restored
to
them
murtagh
without
a
word
of
reply
went
to
the
door
and
shouting
into
the
passage
something
in
irish
the
room
was
instantly
filled
with
bogtrotters
each
at
least
six
feet
high
with
a
stout
shillelah
in
his
hand
murtagh
then
turning
to
his
guests
asked
them
what
they
meant
by
insulting
an
anointed
priest
telling
them
that
it
was
not
for
the
likes
of
them
to
avenge
the
wrongs
of
ireland
i
have
been
clane
mistaken
in
the
whole
of
ye
said
he
i
supposed
ye
irish
but
have
found
to
my
sorrow
that
ye
are
nothing
of
the
kind
purty
fellows
to
pretend
to
be
irish
when
there
is
not
a
word
of
irish
on
the
tongue
of
any
of
ye
divil
a
the
illigant
young
gentleman
to
whom
i
taught
irish
in
dungarvon
times
of
old
though
not
born
in
ireland
has
more
irish
in
him
than
any
ten
of
ye
he
is
the
boy
to
avenge
the
wrongs
of
ireland
if
ever
foreigner
is
to
do
it
then
saying
something
to
the
bogtrotters
they
instantly
cleared
the
room
of
the
young
irelanders
who
retired
sadly
disconcerted
nevertheless
being
very
silly
young
fellows
they
hoisted
the
standard
of
rebellion
few
however
joining
them
partly
because
they
had
no
money
and
partly
because
the
priests
abused
them
with
might
and
main
their
rebellion
ended
in
a
lamentable
manner
themselves
being
seized
and
tried
and
though
convicted
not
deemed
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
sent
to
the
scaffold
where
they
might
have
had
the
satisfaction
of
saying
dulce
et
decorum
est
pro
patria
mori
my
visitor
after
saying
that
of
the
money
won
murtagh
retained
a
considerable
portion
that
a
part
went
to
the
hierarchy
for
what
were
called
church
purposes
and
that
the
took
the
remainder
which
it
employed
in
establishing
a
newspaper
in
which
the
private
characters
of
the
worthiest
and
most
loyal
protestants
in
ireland
were
traduced
and
vilified
concluded
his
account
by
observing
that
it
was
the
common
belief
that
murtagh
having
by
his
services
ecclesiastical
and
political
acquired
the
confidence
of
the
priesthood
and
favour
of
the
government
would
on
the
first
vacancy
be
appointed
to
the
high
office
of

bent
my
steps
in
the
direction
of
the

i
walked
at
a
brisk
rate
and
late
in
the
evening
reached
a
large
town
situate
at
the
entrance
of
an
extensive
firth
or
arm
of
the

which
prevented
my
farther
progress

sleeping
that
night
in
the
suburbs
of

departed
early
next

in
the

of

a
walk
of
about
twenty
miles
brought
me
to
another
large

situated
on
a
river
where
i
again
turned
towards
the

at
the

of
the

i
was
accosted
by
a
individual
somewhat
under
the
middle

dressed
as
a

appendix
chapter
i
a
word
for
lavengro
lavengro
is
the
history
up
to
a
certain
period
of
one
of
rather
a
peculiar
mind
and
system
of
nerves
with
an
exterior
shy
and
cold
under
which
lurk
much
curiosity
especially
with
regard
to
what
is
wild
and
extraordinary
a
considerable
quantity
of
energy
and
industry
and
an
unconquerable
love
of
independence
it
narrates
his
earliest
dreams
and
feelings
dwells
with
minuteness
on
the
ways
words
and
characters
of
his
father
mother
and
brother
lingers
on
the
occasional
of
his
wandering
half
military
childhood
describes
the
gradual
hardening
of
his
bodily
frame
by
robust
exercises
his
successive
struggles
after
his
family
and
himself
have
settled
down
in
a
small
local
capital
to
obtain
knowledge
of
every
kind
but
more
particularly
philological
lore
his
visits
to
the
tent
of
the
romany
chal
and
the
parlour
of
the
german
philosopher
the
effect
produced
upon
his
character
by
his
flinging
himself
into
contact
with
people
all
widely
differing
from
each
other
but
all
extraordinary
his
reluctance
to
settle
down
to
the
ordinary
pursuits
of
life
his
struggles
after
moral
truth
his
glimpses
of
god
and
the
obscuration
of
the
divine
being
to
his
mind
eye
and
his
being
cast
upon
the
world
of
london
by
the
death
of
his
father
at
the
age
of
nineteen
in
the
world
within
a
world
the
world
of
london
it
shows
him
playing
his
part
for
some
time
as
he
best
can
in
the
capacity
of
a
writer
for
reviews
and
magazines
and
describes
what
he
saw
and
underwent
whilst
labouring
in
that
capacity
it
represents
him
however
as
never
forgetting
that
he
is
the
son
of
a
brave
but
poor
gentleman
and
that
if
he
is
a
hack
author
he
is
likewise
a
scholar
it
shows
him
doing
no
dishonourable
jobs
and
proves
that
if
he
occasionally
associates
with
low
characters
he
does
so
chiefly
to
gratify
the
curiosity
of
a
scholar
in
his
conversations
with
the
of
london
bridge
the
scholar
is
ever
apparent
so
again
in
his
acquaintance
with
the
man
of
the
table
for
the
book
is
no
raker
up
of
the
uncleanness
of
london
and
if
it
gives
what
at
first
sight
appears
refuse
it
invariably
shows
that
a
pearl
of
some
kind
generally
a
philological
one
is
contained
amongst
it
it
shows
its
hero
always
accompanied
by
his
love
of
independence
scorning
in
the
greatest
poverty
to
receive
favours
from
anybody
and
describes
him
finally
rescuing
himself
from
peculiarly
miserable
circumstances
by
writing
a
book
an
original
book
within
a
week
even
as
johnson
is
said
to
have
written
his
rasselas
and
beckford
his
vathek
and
tells
how
leaving
london
he
betakes
himself
to
the
roads
and
fields
in
the
country
it
shows
him
leading
a
life
of
roving
adventure
becoming
tinker
gypsy
postillion
ostler
associating
with
various
kinds
of
people
chiefly
of
the
lower
classes
whose
ways
and
habits
are
described
but
though
leading
this
erratic
life
we
gather
from
the
book
that
his
habits
are
neither
vulgar
nor
vicious
that
he
still
follows
to
a
certain
extent
his
favourite
pursuits
hunting
after
strange
characters
or
analysing
strange
words
and
names
at
the
conclusion
of
the
last
chapter
which
terminates
the
first
part
of
the
history
it
hints
that
he
is
about
to
quit
his
native
land
on
a
grand
philological
expedition
those
who
read
this
book
with
attention
and
the
author
begs
to
observe
that
it
would
be
of
little
utility
to
read
it
hurriedly
may
derive
much
information
with
respect
to
matters
of
philology
and
literature
it
will
be
found
treating
of
most
of
the
principal
languages
from
ireland
to
china
and
of
the
literature
which
they
contain
and
it
is
particularly
minute
with
regard
to
the
ways
manners
and
speech
of
the
english
section
of
the
most
extraordinary
and
mysterious
clan
or
tribe
of
people
to
be
found
in
the
whole
world
the
children
of
roma
but
it
contains
matters
of
much
more
importance
than
anything
in
connection
with
philology
and
the
literature
and
manners
of
nations
perhaps
no
work
was
ever
offered
to
the
public
in
which
the
kindness
and
providence
of
god
have
been
set
forth
by
more
striking
examples
or
the
machinations
of
priestcraft
been
more
truly
and
lucidly
exposed
or
the
dangers
which
result
to
a
nation
when
it
abandons
itself
to
effeminacy
and
a
rage
for
what
is
novel
and
fashionable
than
the
present
with
respect
to
the
kindness
and
providence
of
god
are
they
not
exemplified
in
the
case
of
the
old
and
her
son
these
are
beings
in
many
points
bad
but
with
warm
affections
who
after
an
agonizing
separation
are
restored
to
each
other
but
not
until
the
hearts
of
both
are
changed
and
purified
by
the
influence
of
affliction
are
they
not
exemplified
in
the
case
of
the
rich
gentleman
who
touches
objects
in
order
to
avert
the
evil
chance
this
being
has
great
gifts
and
many
amiable
qualities
but
does
not
everybody
see
that
his
besetting
sin
is
selfishness
he
fixes
his
mind
on
certain
objects
and
takes
inordinate
interest
in
them
because
they
are
his
own
and
those
very
objects
through
the
providence
of
god
which
is
kindness
in
disguise
become
snakes
and
scorpions
to
whip
him
tired
of
various
pursuits
he
at
last
becomes
an
author
and
publishes
a
book
which
is
very
much
admired
and
which
he
loves
with
his
usual
inordinate
affection
the
book
consequently
becomes
a
viper
to
him
and
at
last
he
flings
it
aside
and
begins
another
the
book
however
is
not
flung
aside
by
the
world
who
are
benefited
by
it
deriving
pleasure
and
knowledge
from
it
so
the
man
who
merely
wrote
to
gratify
self
has
already
done
good
to
others
and
got
himself
an
honourable
name
but
god
will
not
allow
that
man
to
put
that
book
under
his
head
and
use
it
as
a
pillow
the
book
has
become
a
viper
to
him
he
has
banished
it
and
is
about
another
which
he
finishes
and
gives
to
the
world
it
is
a
better
book
than
the
first
and
every
one
is
delighted
with
it
but
it
proves
to
the
writer
a
scorpion
because
he
loves
it
with
inordinate
affection
but
it
was
good
for
the
world
that
he
produced
this
book
which
stung
him
as
a
scorpion
yes
and
good
for
himself
for
the
labour
of
writing
it
amused
him
and
perhaps
prevented
him
from
dying
of
apoplexy
but
the
book
is
banished
and
another
is
begun
and
herein
again
is
the
providence
of
god
manifested
the
man
has
the
power
of
producing
still
and
god
determines
that
he
shall
give
to
the
world
what
remains
in
his
brain
which
he
would
not
do
had
he
been
satisfied
with
the
second
work
he
would
have
gone
to
sleep
upon
that
as
he
would
upon
the
first
for
the
man
is
selfish
and
lazy
in
his
account
of
what
he
suffered
during
the
composition
of
this
work
his
besetting
sin
of
selfishness
is
manifest
enough
the
work
on
which
he
is
engaged
occupies
his
every
thought
it
is
his
idol
his
deity
it
shall
be
all
his
own
he
wo
borrow
a
thought
from
any
one
else
and
he
is
so
afraid
lest
when
he
publishes
it
that
it
should
be
thought
that
he
had
borrowed
from
any
one
that
he
is
continually
touching
objects
his
nervous
system
owing
to
his
extreme
selfishness
having
become
partly
deranged
he
is
left
touching
in
order
to
banish
the
evil
chance
from
his
book
his
deity
no
more
of
his
history
is
given
but
does
the
reader
think
that
god
will
permit
that
man
to
go
to
sleep
on
his
third
book
however
extraordinary
it
may
be
assuredly
not
god
will
not
permit
that
man
to
rest
till
he
has
cured
him
to
a
certain
extent
of
his
selfishness
which
has
however
hitherto
been
very
useful
to
the
world
then
again
in
the
tale
of
peter
williams
is
not
the
hand
of
providence
to
be
seen
this
person
commits
a
sin
in
his
childhood
utters
words
of
blasphemy
the
remembrance
of
which
in
after
life
preying
upon
his
imagination
unfits
him
for
quiet
pursuits
to
which
he
seems
to
have
been
naturally
inclined
but
for
the
remembrance
of
that
sin
he
would
have
been
peter
williams
the
quiet
and
respectable
welsh
farmer
somewhat
fond
of
reading
the
ancient
literature
of
his
country
in
winter
evenings
after
his
work
was
done
god
however
was
aware
that
there
was
something
in
peter
williams
to
entitle
him
to
assume
a
higher
calling
he
therefore
permits
this
sin
which
though
a
childish
affair
was
yet
a
sin
and
committed
deliberately
to
prey
upon
his
mind
till
he
becomes
at
last
an
instrument
in
the
hand
of
god
a
humble
paul
the
great
preacher
peter
williams
who
though
he
considers
himself
a
reprobate
and
a
castaway
instead
of
having
recourse
to
drinking
in
mad
desperation
as
many
do
who
consider
themselves
reprobates
goes
about
wales
and
england
preaching
the
word
of
god
dilating
on
his
power
and
majesty
and
visiting
the
sick
and
afflicted
until
god
sees
fit
to
restore
to
him
his
peace
of
mind
which
he
does
not
do
however
until
that
mind
is
in
a
proper
condition
to
receive
peace
till
it
has
been
purified
by
the
pain
of
the
one
idea
which
has
so
long
been
permitted
to
riot
in
his
brain
which
pain
however
an
angel
in
the
shape
of
a
gentle
faithful
wife
had
occasionally
alleviated
for
god
is
merciful
even
in
the
blows
which
he
bestoweth
and
will
not
permit
any
one
to
be
tempted
beyond
the
measure
which
he
can
support
and
here
it
will
be
as
well
for
the
reader
to
ponder
upon
the
means
by
which
the
welsh
preacher
is
relieved
from
his
mental
misery
he
is
not
relieved
by
a
text
from
the
bible
by
the
words
of
consolation
and
wisdom
addressed
to
him
by
his
wife
nor
by
the
preaching
of
one
yet
more
eloquent
than
himself
but
by
a
quotation
made
by
lavengro
from
the
life
of
mary
flanders
and
prostitute
which
life
lavengro
had
been
in
the
habit
of
reading
at
the
stall
of
his
old
friend
the
on
london
bridge
who
had
herself
been
very
much
addicted
to
the
perusal
of
it
though
without
any
profit
whatever
should
the
reader
be
dissatisfied
with
the
manner
in
which
peter
williams
is
made
to
find
relief
the
author
would
wish
to
answer
that
the
almighty
frequently
accomplishes
his
purposes
by
means
which
appear
very
singular
to
the
eyes
of
men
and
at
the
same
time
to
observe
that
the
manner
in
which
that
relief
is
obtained
is
calculated
to
read
a
lesson
to
the
proud
fanciful
and
squeamish
who
are
ever
in
a
fidget
lest
they
should
be
thought
to
mix
with
low
society
or
to
bestow
a
moment
attention
on
publications
which
are
not
what
is
called
of
a
perfectly
unobjectionable
character
had
not
lavengro
formed
the
acquaintance
of
the
on
london
bridge
he
would
not
have
had
an
opportunity
of
reading
the
life
of
mary
flanders
and
consequently
of
storing
in
a
memory
which
never
forgets
anything
a
passage
which
contained
a
balm
for
the
agonized
mind
of
poor
peter
williams
the
best
medicines
are
not
always
found
in
the
finest
shops
suppose
for
example
if
instead
of
going
to
london
bridge
to
read
he
had
gone
to
albemarle
street
and
had
received
from
the
proprietors
of
the
literary
establishment
in
that
very
fashionable
street
permission
to
read
the
publications
on
the
tables
of
the
saloons
there
does
the
reader
think
he
would
have
met
any
balm
in
those
publications
for
the
case
of
peter
williams
does
the
reader
suppose
that
he
would
have
found
mary
flanders
there
he
would
certainly
have
found
that
highly
unobjectionable
publication
rasselas
and
the
spectator
or
lives
of
royal
and
illustrious
personages
but
of
a
surety
no
mary
flanders
so
when
lavengro
met
with
peter
williams
he
would
have
been
unprovided
with
a
balm
to
cure
his
ulcerated
mind
and
have
parted
from
him
in
a
way
not
quite
so
satisfactory
as
the
manner
in
which
he
took
his
leave
of
him
for
it
is
certain
that
he
might
have
read
rasselas
and
all
other
unexceptionable
works
to
be
found
in
the
library
of
albemarle
street
over
and
over
again
before
he
would
have
found
any
cure
in
them
for
the
case
of
peter
williams
therefore
the
author
requests
the
reader
to
drop
any
squeamish
nonsense
he
may
wish
to
utter
about
mary
flanders
and
the
manner
in
which
peter
williams
was
cured
and
now
with
respect
to
the
old
man
who
knew
chinese
but
could
not
tell
what
was
this
individual
was
a
man
whose
natural
powers
would
have
been
utterly
buried
and
lost
beneath
a
mountain
of
sloth
and
laziness
had
not
god
determined
otherwise
he
had
in
his
early
years
chalked
out
for
himself
a
plan
of
life
in
which
he
had
his
own
ease
and
solely
in
view
he
had
no
particular
bad
passions
to
gratify
he
only
wished
to
live
a
happy
quiet
life
just
as
if
the
business
of
this
mighty
world
could
be
carried
on
by
innocent
people
fond
of
ease
or
quiet
or
that
providence
would
permit
innocent
quiet
drones
to
occupy
any
portion
of
the
earth
and
to
cumber
it
god
had
at
any
rate
decreed
that
this
man
should
not
cumber
it
as
a
drone
he
brings
a
certain
affliction
upon
him
the
agony
of
which
produces
that
terrible
whirling
of
the
brain
which
unless
it
is
stopped
in
time
produces
madness
he
suffers
indescribable
misery
for
a
period
until
one
morning
his
attention
is
arrested
and
his
curiosity
is
aroused
by
certain
chinese
letters
on
a
teapot
his
curiosity
increases
more
and
more
and
of
course
in
proportion
as
his
curiosity
is
increased
with
respect
to
the
chinese
marks
the
misery
in
his
brain
produced
by
his
mental
affliction
decreases
he
sets
about
learning
chinese
and
after
the
lapse
of
many
years
during
which
his
mind
subsides
into
a
certain
state
of
tranquillity
he
acquires
sufficient
knowledge
of
chinese
to
be
able
to
translate
with
ease
the
inscriptions
to
be
found
on
its
singular
crockery
yes
the
laziest
of
human
beings
through
the
providence
of
god
a
being
too
of
rather
inferior
capacity
acquires
the
written
part
of
a
language
so
difficult
that
as
lavengro
said
on
a
former
occasion
none
but
the
cleverest
people
in
europe
the
french
are
able
to
acquire
it
but
god
did
not
intend
that
man
should
merely
acquire
chinese
he
intended
that
he
should
be
of
use
to
his
species
and
by
the
instrumentality
of
the
first
chinese
inscription
which
he
translates
the
one
which
first
arrested
his
curiosity
he
is
taught
the
duty
of
hospitality
yes
by
means
of
an
inscription
in
the
language
of
a
people
who
have
scarcely
an
idea
of
hospitality
themselves
god
causes
the
slothful
man
to
play
a
useful
and
beneficent
part
in
the
world
relieving
distressed
wanderers
and
amongst
others
lavengro
himself
but
a
striking
indication
of
the
man
surprising
sloth
is
still
apparent
in
what
he
omits
to
do
he
has
learnt
chinese
the
most
difficult
of
languages
and
he
practises
acts
of
hospitality
because
he
believes
himself
enjoined
to
do
so
by
the
chinese
inscription
but
he
can
not
tell
the
hour
of
the
day
by
the
clock
within
his
house
he
can
get
on
he
thinks
very
well
without
being
able
to
do
so
therefore
from
this
one
omission
it
is
easy
to
come
to
a
conclusion
as
to
what
a
sluggard
part
the
man
would
have
played
in
life
but
for
the
dispensation
of
providence
nothing
but
extreme
agony
could
have
induced
such
a
man
to
do
anything
useful
he
still
continues
with
all
he
has
acquired
with
all
his
usefulness
and
with
all
his
innocence
of
character
without
any
proper
sense
of
religion
though
he
has
attained
a
rather
advanced
age
if
it
be
observed
that
this
want
of
religion
is
a
great
defect
in
the
story
the
author
begs
leave
to
observe
that
he
can
not
help
it
lavengro
relates
the
lives
of
people
so
far
as
they
were
placed
before
him
but
no
further
it
was
certainly
a
great
defect
in
so
good
a
man
to
be
without
religion
it
was
likewise
a
great
defect
in
so
learned
a
man
not
to
be
able
to
tell
what
was
it
is
probable
that
god
in
his
loving
kindness
will
not
permit
that
man
to
go
out
of
the
world
without
religion
who
knows
but
some
powerful
minister
of
the
church
full
of
zeal
for
the
glory
of
god
will
illume
that
man
dark
mind
perhaps
some
clergyman
will
come
to
the
parish
who
will
visit
him
and
teach
him
his
duty
to
his
god
yes
it
is
very
probable
that
such
a
man
before
he
dies
will
have
been
made
to
love
his
god
whether
he
will
ever
learn
to
know
what
is
another
matter
it
is
probable
that
he
will
go
out
of
the
world
without
knowing
what
it
is
not
so
necessary
to
be
able
to
tell
the
time
of
day
by
the
clock
as
to
know
one
god
through
his
inspired
word
a
man
can
not
get
to
heaven
without
religion
but
a
man
can
get
there
very
comfortably
without
knowing
what
but
above
all
the
care
and
providence
of
god
are
manifested
in
the
case
of
lavengro
himself
by
the
manner
in
which
he
is
enabled
to
make
his
way
in
the
world
up
to
a
certain
period
without
falling
a
prey
either
to
vice
or
poverty
in
his
history
there
is
a
wonderful
illustration
of
part
of
the
text
quoted
by
his
mother
i
have
been
young
but
now
am
old
yet
never
saw
i
the
righteous
forsaken
or
his
seed
begging
his
bread
he
is
the
son
of
good
and
honourable
parents
but
at
the
critical
period
of
life
that
of
entering
into
the
world
he
finds
himself
without
any
earthly
friend
to
help
him
yet
he
manages
to
make
his
way
he
does
not
become
a
captain
in
the
life
guards
it
is
true
nor
does
he
get
into
parliament
nor
does
the
last
volume
conclude
in
the
most
satisfactory
and
unobjectionable
manner
by
his
marrying
a
dowager
countess
as
that
wise
man
addison
did
or
by
his
settling
down
as
a
great
country
gentleman
perfectly
happy
and
contented
like
the
very
moral
roderick
random
or
the
equally
estimable
peregrine
pickle
he
is
hack
author
gypsy
tinker
and
postillion
yet
upon
the
whole
he
seems
to
be
quite
as
happy
as
the
younger
sons
of
most
earls
to
have
as
high
feelings
of
honour
and
when
the
reader
loses
sight
of
him
he
has
money
in
his
pocket
honestly
acquired
to
enable
him
to
commence
a
journey
quite
as
laudable
as
those
which
the
younger
sons
of
earls
generally
undertake
surely
all
this
is
a
manifestation
of
the
kindness
and
providence
of
god
and
yet
he
is
not
a
religious
person
up
to
the
time
when
the
reader
loses
sight
of
him
he
is
decidedly
not
a
religious
person
he
has
glimpses
it
is
true
of
that
god
who
does
not
forsake
him
but
he
prays
very
seldom
is
not
fond
of
going
to
church
and
though
he
admires
tate
and
brady
version
of
the
psalms
his
admiration
is
rather
caused
by
the
beautiful
poetry
which
that
version
contains
than
the
religion
yet
his
tale
is
not
finished
like
the
tale
of
the
gentleman
who
touched
objects
and
that
of
the
old
man
who
knew
chinese
without
knowing
what
was
perhaps
like
them
he
is
destined
to
become
religious
and
to
have
instead
of
occasional
glimpses
frequent
and
distinct
views
of
his
god
yet
though
he
may
become
religious
it
is
hardly
to
be
expected
that
he
will
become
a
very
precise
and
straightlaced
person
it
is
probable
that
he
will
retain
with
his
scholarship
something
of
his
gypsyism
his
predilection
for
the
hammer
and
tongs
and
perhaps
some
inclination
to
put
on
certain
gloves
not
white
kid
with
any
friend
who
may
be
inclined
for
a
little
old
english
diversion
and
a
readiness
to
take
a
glass
of
ale
with
plenty
of
malt
in
it
and
as
little
hop
as
may
well
be
ale
at
least
two
years
old
with
the
aforesaid
friend
when
the
diversion
is
over
for
as
it
is
the
belief
of
the
writer
that
a
person
may
get
to
heaven
very
comfortably
without
knowing
what
so
it
is
his
belief
that
he
will
not
be
refused
admission
there
because
to
the
last
he
has
been
fond
of
healthy
and
invigorating
exercises
and
felt
a
willingness
to
partake
of
any
of
the
good
things
which
it
pleases
the
almighty
to
put
within
the
reach
of
his
children
during
their
sojourn
upon
earth
chapter
ii
on
priestcraft
the
writer
will
now
say
a
few
words
about
priestcraft
and
the
machinations
of
rome
and
will
afterwards
say
something
about
himself
and
his
motives
for
writing
against
them
with
respect
to
rome
and
her
machinations
much
valuable
information
can
be
obtained
from
particular
parts
of
lavengro
and
its
sequel
shortly
before
the
time
when
the
hero
of
the
book
is
launched
into
the
world
the
popish
agitation
in
england
had
commenced
the
popish
propaganda
had
determined
to
make
a
grand
attempt
on
england
popish
priests
were
scattered
over
the
land
doing
the
best
they
could
to
make
converts
to
the
old
superstition
with
the
plans
of
rome
and
her
hopes
and
the
reasons
on
which
those
hopes
are
grounded
the
hero
of
the
book
becomes
acquainted
during
an
expedition
which
he
makes
into
the
country
from
certain
conversations
which
he
holds
with
a
priest
in
a
dingle
in
which
the
hero
had
taken
up
his
residence
he
likewise
learns
from
the
same
person
much
of
the
secret
history
of
the
roman
see
and
many
matters
connected
with
the
origin
and
progress
of
the
popish
superstition
the
individual
with
whom
he
holds
these
conversations
is
a
learned
intelligent
but
person
of
a
character
however
very
common
amongst
the
priests
of
rome
who
in
general
are
people
void
of
all
religion
and
who
notwithstanding
they
are
tied
to
rome
by
a
band
which
they
have
neither
the
power
nor
wish
to
break
turn
her
and
her
practices
over
their
cups
with
their
confidential
associates
to
a
ridicule
only
exceeded
by
that
to
which
they
turn
those
who
become
the
dupes
of
their
mistress
and
themselves
it
is
now
necessary
that
the
writer
should
say
something
with
respect
to
himself
and
his
motives
for
waging
war
against
rome
first
of
all
with
respect
to
himself
he
wishes
to
state
that
to
the
very
last
moment
of
his
life
he
will
do
and
say
all
that
in
his
power
may
be
to
hold
up
to
contempt
and
execration
the
priestcraft
and
practices
of
rome
there
is
perhaps
no
person
better
acquainted
than
himself
not
even
among
the
choicest
spirits
of
the
priesthood
with
the
origin
and
history
of
popery
from
what
he
saw
and
heard
of
popery
in
england
at
a
very
early
period
of
his
life
his
curiosity
was
aroused
and
he
spared
himself
no
trouble
either
by
travel
or
study
to
make
himself
well
acquainted
with
it
in
all
its
phases
the
result
being
a
hatred
of
it
which
he
hopes
and
trusts
he
shall
retain
till
the
moment
when
his
spirit
quits
the
body
popery
is
the
great
lie
of
the
world
a
source
from
which
more
misery
and
social
degradation
have
flowed
upon
the
human
race
than
from
all
the
other
sources
from
which
those
evils
come
it
is
the
oldest
of
all
superstitions
and
though
in
europe
it
assumes
the
name
of
christianity
it
existed
and
flourished
amidst
the
himalayan
hills
at
least
two
thousand
years
before
the
real
christ
was
born
in
bethlehem
of
judea
in
a
word
it
is
buddhism
and
let
those
who
may
be
disposed
to
doubt
this
assertion
compare
the
popery
of
rome
and
the
superstitious
practices
of
its
followers
with
the
doings
of
the
priests
who
surround
the
grand
lama
and
the
mouthings
bellowing
turnings
round
and
above
all
the
penances
of
the
followers
of
buddh
with
those
of
roman
devotees
but
he
is
not
going
to
dwell
here
on
this
point
it
is
dwelt
upon
at
tolerable
length
in
the
text
and
has
likewise
been
handled
with
extraordinary
power
by
the
pen
of
the
gifted
but
irreligious
volney
moreover
the
of
the
roman
priesthood
are
perfectly
well
aware
that
their
system
is
nothing
but
buddhism
under
a
slight
disguise
and
the
european
world
in
general
has
entertained
for
some
time
past
an
inkling
of
the
fact
and
now
a
few
words
with
respect
to
the
motives
of
the
writer
for
expressing
a
hatred
for
rome
this
expressed
abhorrence
of
the
author
for
rome
might
be
entitled
to
little
regard
provided
it
were
possible
to
attribute
it
to
any
motive
there
have
been
professed
enemies
of
rome
or
of
this
or
that
system
but
their
professed
enmity
may
frequently
be
traced
to
some
cause
which
does
them
little
credit
but
the
writer
of
these
lines
has
no
motive
and
can
have
no
motive
for
his
enmity
to
rome
save
the
abhorrence
of
an
honest
heart
for
what
is
false
base
and
cruel
a
certain
clergyman
wrote
with
much
heat
against
the
papists
in
the
time
of
who
was
known
to
favour
the
papists
but
was
not
expected
to
continue
long
in
office
and
whose
supposed
successor
the
person
indeed
who
did
succeed
him
was
thought
to
be
hostile
to
the
papists
this
divine
who
obtained
a
rich
benefice
from
the
successor
of
who
during
time
had
always
opposed
him
in
everything
he
proposed
to
do
and
who
of
course
during
that
time
affected
to
be
very
inimical
to
popery
this
divine
might
well
be
suspected
of
having
a
motive
equally
creditable
for
writing
against
the
papists
as
that
which
induced
him
to
write
for
them
as
soon
as
his
patron
who
eventually
did
something
more
for
him
had
espoused
their
cause
but
what
motive
save
an
honest
one
can
the
present
writer
have
for
expressing
an
abhorrence
of
popery
he
is
no
clergyman
and
consequently
can
expect
neither
benefices
nor
bishoprics
supposing
it
were
the
fashion
of
the
present
or
likely
to
be
the
fashion
of
any
future
administration
to
reward
clergymen
with
benefices
or
bishoprics
who
in
the
defence
of
the
religion
of
their
country
write
or
shall
write
against
popery
and
not
to
reward
those
who
write
or
shall
write
in
favour
of
it
and
all
its
nonsense
and
abominations
but
if
not
a
clergyman
he
is
the
servant
of
a
certain
society
which
has
the
overthrow
of
popery
in
view
and
therefore
etc
this
assertion
which
has
been
frequently
made
is
incorrect
even
as
those
who
have
made
it
probably
knew
it
to
be
he
is
the
servant
of
no
society
whatever
he
eats
his
own
bread
and
is
one
of
the
very
few
men
in
england
who
are
independent
in
every
sense
of
the
word
it
is
true
he
went
to
spain
with
the
colours
of
that
society
on
his
hat
oh
the
blood
glows
in
his
veins
oh
the
marrow
awakes
in
his
old
bones
when
he
thinks
of
what
he
accomplished
in
spain
in
the
cause
of
religion
and
civilization
with
the
colours
of
that
society
in
his
hat
and
its
weapon
in
his
hand
even
the
sword
of
the
word
of
god
how
with
that
weapon
he
hewed
left
and
right
making
the
priests
fly
before
him
and
run
away
squeaking
vaya
que
demonio
es
este
ay
and
when
he
thinks
of
the
plenty
of
bible
swords
which
he
left
behind
him
destined
to
prove
and
which
have
already
proved
pretty
calthrops
in
the
heels
of
popery
halloo
batuschca
he
exclaimed
the
other
night
on
reading
an
article
in
a
newspaper
what
do
you
think
of
the
present
doings
in
spain
your
old
friend
the
zingaro
the
gitano
who
rode
about
spain
to
say
nothing
of
galicia
with
the
greek
buchini
behind
him
as
his
squire
had
a
hand
in
bringing
them
about
there
are
many
brave
spaniards
connected
with
the
present
movement
who
took
bibles
from
his
hands
and
read
them
and
profited
by
them
learning
from
the
inspired
page
the
duties
of
one
man
towards
another
and
the
real
value
of
a
priesthood
and
their
head
who
set
at
nought
the
word
of
god
and
think
only
of
their
own
temporal
interests
ay
and
who
learned
gitano
their
own
gitano
from
the
lips
of
the
london
caloro
and
also
songs
in
the
said
gitano
very
fit
to
dumbfounder
your
priests
when
they
attempt
to
bewilder
people
minds
with
their
and
nonsense
songs
such
as
un
erajai
sinaba
chibando
un
sermon
but
with
that
society
he
has
long
since
ceased
to
have
any
connection
he
bade
it
adieu
with
feelings
of
love
and
admiration
more
than
fourteen
years
ago
so
in
continuing
to
assault
popery
no
hopes
of
interest
founded
on
that
society
can
sway
his
mind
interest
who
with
worldly
interest
in
view
would
ever
have
anything
to
do
with
that
society
it
is
poor
and
supported
like
its
founder
christ
by
poor
people
and
so
far
from
having
political
influence
it
is
in
such
disfavour
and
has
ever
been
with
the
dastardly
great
to
whom
the
government
of
england
has
for
many
years
past
been
confided
that
they
having
borne
its
colours
only
for
a
month
would
be
sufficient
to
exclude
any
man
whatever
his
talents
his
learning
or
his
courage
may
be
from
the
slightest
chance
of
being
permitted
to
serve
his
country
either
for
fee
or
without
a
fellow
who
unites
in
himself
the
bankrupt
trader
the
broken
author
or
rather
and
the
single
speech
spouter
of
the
house
of
commons
may
look
forward
always
supposing
that
at
one
time
he
has
been
a
foaming
radical
to
the
government
of
an
important
colony
ay
an
ancient
fox
who
has
lost
his
tail
may
provided
he
has
a
score
of
radical
friends
who
will
swear
that
he
can
bark
chinese
though
chinese
is
not
barked
but
sung
be
forced
upon
a
chinese
colony
though
it
is
well
known
that
to
have
lost
one
tail
is
considered
by
the
chinese
in
general
as
an
irreparable
infamy
whilst
to
have
been
once
connected
with
a
certain
society
to
which
to
its
honour
be
it
said
all
the
radical
party
are
vehemently
hostile
would
be
quite
sufficient
to
keep
any
one
not
only
from
a
government
but
something
much
less
even
though
he
could
translate
the
rhymed
sessions
of
hariri
and
were
versed
still
retaining
his
tail
in
the
two
languages
in
which
wrote
his
eulogium
on
moukden
that
piece
which
translated
by
amyot
the
learned
jesuit
won
the
applause
of
the
celebrated
voltaire
no
were
the
author
influenced
by
hopes
of
fee
or
reward
he
would
instead
of
writing
against
popery
write
for
it
all
the
trumpery
titled
he
will
not
call
them
great
again
would
then
be
for
him
and
their
masters
the
radicals
with
their
hosts
of
newspapers
would
be
for
him
more
especially
if
he
would
commence
maligning
the
society
whose
colours
he
had
once
on
his
hat
a
society
which
as
the
priest
says
in
the
text
is
one
of
the
very
few
protestant
institutions
for
which
the
popish
church
entertains
any
fear
and
consequently
respect
as
it
respects
nothing
which
it
does
not
fear
the
writer
said
that
certain
rulers
would
never
forgive
him
for
having
been
connected
with
that
society
he
went
perhaps
too
far
in
saying
never
it
is
probable
that
they
would
take
him
into
favour
on
one
condition
which
is
that
he
should
turn
his
pen
and
his
voice
against
that
society
such
a
mark
of
a
better
way
of
thinking
would
perhaps
induce
them
to
give
him
a
government
nearly
as
good
as
that
which
they
gave
to
a
certain
ancient
radical
fox
at
the
intercession
of
his
radical
friends
who
were
bound
to
keep
him
from
the
pauper
kennel
after
he
had
promised
to
foam
bark
and
snarl
at
corruption
no
more
he
might
even
entertain
hopes
of
succeeding
nay
of
superseding
the
ancient
creature
in
his
government
but
even
were
he
as
badly
off
as
he
is
well
off
he
would
do
no
such
thing
he
would
rather
exist
on
crusts
and
water
he
has
often
done
so
and
been
happy
nay
he
would
rather
starve
than
be
a
rogue
for
even
the
feeling
of
starvation
is
happiness
compared
with
what
he
feels
who
knows
himself
to
be
a
rogue
provided
he
has
any
feeling
at
all
what
is
the
use
of
a
mitre
or
knighthood
to
a
man
who
has
betrayed
his
principles
what
is
the
use
of
a
gilt
collar
nay
even
of
a
pair
of
scarlet
breeches
to
a
fox
who
has
lost
his
tail
oh
the
horror
which
haunts
the
mind
of
a
fox
who
has
lost
his
tail
and
with
reason
for
his
very
mate
loathes
him
and
more
especially
if
like
himself
she
has
lost
her
brush
oh
the
horror
which
haunts
the
mind
of
the
rogue
who
has
parted
with
his
principles
or
those
which
he
professed
for
what
we
suppose
a
government
what
the
use
of
a
government
if
the
next
day
after
you
have
received
it
you
are
obliged
for
very
shame
to
scurry
off
to
it
with
the
hoot
of
every
honest
man
sounding
in
your
ears
lightly
liar
leaped
and
away
ran
piers
plowman
but
bigotry
it
has
been
said
makes
the
author
write
against
popery
and
bigotry
indeed
will
make
a
person
say
or
do
anything
but
the
writer
is
a
very
pretty
bigot
truly
where
will
the
public
find
traces
of
bigotry
in
anything
he
has
written
he
has
written
against
rome
with
all
his
heart
with
all
his
mind
with
all
his
soul
and
with
all
his
strength
but
as
a
person
may
be
quite
honest
and
speak
and
write
against
rome
in
like
manner
he
may
speak
and
write
against
her
and
be
quite
free
from
bigotry
though
it
is
impossible
for
any
one
but
a
bigot
or
a
bad
man
to
write
or
speak
in
her
praise
her
doctrines
actions
and
machinations
being
what
they
are
bigotry
the
author
was
born
and
has
always
continued
in
the
wrong
church
for
bigotry
the
quiet
unpretending
church
of
england
a
church
which
had
it
been
a
bigoted
church
and
not
long
suffering
almost
to
a
fault
might
with
its
opportunities
as
the
priest
says
in
the
text
have
stood
in
a
very
different
position
from
that
which
it
occupies
at
present
no
let
those
who
are
in
search
of
bigotry
seek
for
it
in
a
church
very
different
from
the
inoffensive
church
of
england
which
never
encourages
cruelty
or
calumny
let
them
seek
for
it
amongst
the
members
of
the
church
of
rome
and
more
especially
amongst
those
who
have
renegaded
to
it
there
is
nothing
however
false
and
horrible
which
a
pervert
to
rome
will
not
say
for
his
church
and
which
his
priests
will
not
encourage
him
in
saying
and
there
is
nothing
however
horrible
the
more
horrible
indeed
and
revolting
to
human
nature
the
more
eager
he
would
be
to
do
it
which
he
will
not
do
for
it
and
which
his
priests
will
not
encourage
him
in
doing
of
the
readiness
which
converts
to
popery
exhibit
to
sacrifice
all
the
ties
of
blood
and
affection
on
the
shrine
of
their
religion
there
is
a
curious
illustration
in
the
work
of
luigi
pulci
this
man
who
was
born
at
florence
in
the
year
and
who
was
deeply
versed
in
the
bible
composed
a
poem
called
the
morgante
maggiore
which
he
recited
at
the
table
of
lorenzo
de
medici
the
great
patron
of
italian
genius
it
is
a
and
religious
poem
in
which
the
legends
of
and
of
the
popish
church
are
turned
to
unbounded
ridicule
the
pretended
hero
of
it
is
a
converted
giant
called
morgante
though
his
adventures
do
not
occupy
the
twentieth
part
of
the
poem
the
principal
personages
being
charlemagne
orlando
and
his
cousin
rinaldo
of
montalban
morgante
has
two
brothers
both
of
them
giants
and
in
the
first
canto
of
the
poem
morgante
is
represented
with
his
brothers
as
carrying
on
a
feud
with
the
abbot
and
monks
of
a
certain
convent
built
upon
the
confines
of
heathenesse
the
giants
being
in
the
habit
of
flinging
down
stones
or
rather
huge
rocks
on
the
convent
orlando
however
who
is
banished
from
the
court
of
charlemagne
arriving
at
the
convent
undertakes
to
destroy
them
and
accordingly
kills
passamonte
and
alabastro
and
converts
morgante
whose
mind
had
been
previously
softened
by
a
vision
in
which
the
blessed
virgin
figures
no
sooner
is
he
converted
than
as
a
sign
of
his
penitence
what
does
he
do
but
hastens
and
cuts
off
the
hands
of
his
two
brothers
saying
io
vo
tagliar
le
mani
a
tutti
quanti
e
porterolle
a
que
monaci
santi
and
he
does
cut
off
the
hands
of
his
brethren
and
carries
them
to
the
abbot
who
blesses
him
for
so
doing
pulci
here
is
holding
up
to
ridicule
and
execration
the
horrid
butchery
or
betrayal
of
friends
by
popish
converts
and
the
encouragement
they
receive
from
the
priest
no
sooner
is
a
person
converted
to
popery
than
his
principal
thought
is
how
he
can
bring
the
hands
and
feet
of
his
brethren
however
harmless
they
may
be
and
different
from
the
giants
to
the
holy
priests
who
if
he
manages
to
do
so
never
fail
to
praise
him
saying
to
the
miserable
wretch
as
the
abbot
said
to
morgante
tu
sarai
or
perfetto
e
vero
amico
a
cristo
quanto
tu
gli
eri
nemico
can
the
english
public
deny
the
justice
of
pulci
illustration
after
something
which
it
has
lately
witnessed
has
it
not
seen
equivalents
for
the
hands
and
feet
of
brothers
carried
by
popish
perverts
to
the
holy
priests
and
has
it
not
seen
the
manner
in
which
the
offering
has
been
received
let
those
who
are
in
quest
of
bigotry
seek
for
it
among
the
perverts
to
rome
and
not
amongst
those
who
born
in
the
pale
of
the
church
of
england
have
always
continued
in
it
chapter
iii
on
foreign
nonsense
with
respect
to
the
third
point
various
lessons
which
the
book
reads
to
the
nation
at
large
and
which
it
would
be
well
for
the
nation
to
ponder
and
profit
by
there
are
many
species
of
nonsense
to
which
the
nation
is
much
addicted
and
of
which
the
perusal
of
lavengro
ought
to
give
them
a
wholesome
shame
first
of
all
with
respect
to
the
foreign
nonsense
so
prevalent
now
in
england
the
hero
is
a
scholar
but
though
possessed
of
a
great
many
tongues
he
affects
to
be
neither
frenchman
nor
german
nor
this
or
that
foreigner
he
is
one
who
loves
his
country
and
the
language
and
literature
of
his
country
and
speaks
up
for
each
and
all
when
there
is
occasion
to
do
so
now
what
is
the
case
with
nine
out
of
ten
amongst
those
of
the
english
who
study
foreign
languages
no
sooner
have
they
picked
up
a
smattering
of
this
or
that
speech
than
they
begin
to
abuse
their
own
country
and
everything
connected
with
it
more
especially
its
language
this
is
particularly
the
case
with
those
who
call
themselves
german
students
it
is
said
and
the
writer
believes
with
truth
that
when
a
woman
falls
in
love
with
a
particularly
ugly
fellow
she
squeezes
him
with
ten
times
more
zest
than
she
would
a
handsome
one
if
captivated
by
him
so
it
is
with
these
german
students
no
sooner
have
they
taken
german
in
hand
than
there
is
nothing
like
german
oh
the
dear
delightful
german
how
proud
i
am
that
it
is
now
my
own
and
that
its
divine
literature
is
within
my
reach
and
all
this
whilst
mumbling
the
most
uncouth
speech
and
crunching
the
most
crabbed
literature
in
europe
the
writer
is
not
an
exclusive
admirer
of
everything
english
he
does
not
advise
his
country
people
never
to
go
abroad
never
to
study
foreign
languages
and
he
does
not
wish
to
persuade
them
that
there
is
nothing
beautiful
or
valuable
in
foreign
literature
he
only
wishes
that
they
would
not
make
themselves
fools
with
respect
to
foreign
people
foreign
languages
or
reading
that
if
they
chance
to
have
been
in
spain
and
have
picked
up
a
little
spanish
they
would
not
affect
the
airs
of
spaniards
that
if
males
they
would
not
make
tomfools
of
themselves
by
sticking
cigars
into
their
mouths
dressing
themselves
in
zamarras
and
saying
carajo
and
if
females
that
they
would
not
make
zanies
of
themselves
by
sticking
cigars
into
their
mouths
flinging
mantillas
over
their
heads
and
by
saying
carai
and
perhaps
carajo
too
or
if
they
have
been
in
france
or
italy
and
have
picked
up
a
little
french
or
italian
they
would
not
affect
to
be
french
or
italians
and
particularly
after
having
been
a
month
or
two
in
germany
or
picked
up
a
little
german
in
england
they
would
not
make
themselves
foolish
about
everything
german
as
the
in
the
book
does
a
real
character
the
founder
of
the
german
school
in
england
and
the
cleverest
englishman
who
ever
talked
or
wrote
encomiastic
nonsense
about
germany
and
the
germans
of
all
infatuations
connected
with
what
is
foreign
the
infatuation
about
everything
that
is
german
to
a
certain
extent
prevalent
in
england
is
assuredly
the
most
ridiculous
one
can
find
something
like
a
palliation
for
people
making
themselves
somewhat
foolish
about
particular

but
the
german
language
german
literature
and
the

the
writer
has
already
stated
his
opinion
with
respect
to
german

does
not

repeats
however
he
acknowledges
that
there
is
one
fine
poem
in

german
language
that
poem
is
the
oberon
a
poem
by
the
bye
ignored
by

and
of
course
by
the
the
germans
he
has
been
amongst
them
and
amongst
many
other
nations
and
confesses
that
his
opinion
of
the
germans
as
men
is
a
very
low
one
germany
it
is
true

produced
one
very
great

fought
the

and
nearly
knocked
him
down

this

a

affect
to
despise

very
fond

rather
foolery

and

not
an
affair
of
or
yesterday
it
is
of
very
ancient
date

was
very
properly
exposed
nearly
three
centuries

by
one

what
is
gentility
people
in
different
stations
in
england
entertain
different
ideas
of
what
is
genteel
but
it
must
be
something
gorgeous
glittering
or
tawdry
to
be
considered
genteel
by
any
of
them
the
of
the
english
aristocracy

some
young

genteel

it
was
but
lately
that
the
daughter
of
an
english
marquis
was
heard
to
say
that
the
sole
remaining
wish
of
her
heart
she
had
known
misfortunes
and
was
not

from
fifty
was
to

the

wish
of
the

of
one
who
ought
to
have
been
thinking
of
the
grave
and
judgment
was
to
be

to
the
miscreant

had
caused
the

noble

out

admire
the

adored
the
emperor

he
became

terminated

flamson
this
person
makes
his
grand
debut
in
the
year
at
a
public
meeting
in
the
principal
room
of
a
country
inn
he
has
come
into
the
neighbourhood
with
the
character
of
a
man
worth
a
million
pounds
who
is
to
make
everybody
fortune
at
this
time
however
he
is
not
worth
a
shilling
of
his
own
though
he
flashes
about
dexterously
three
or
four
thousand
pounds
part
of
which
sum
he
has
obtained
by
specious
pretences
and
part
from
certain
individuals
who
are
his
confederates
but
in
the
year
he
is
really
in
possession
of
the
fortune
which
he
and
his
agents
pretended
to
be
worth
ten
years
before
he
is
worth
a
million
pounds
by
what
means
has
he
come
by
them
by
railroad
contracts
for
which
he
takes
care
to
be
paid
in
hard
cash
before
he
attempts
to
perform
them
and
to
carry
out
which
he
makes
use
of
the
sweat
and
blood
of
wretches
who
since
their
organization
have
introduced
crimes
and
language
into
england
to
which
it
was
previously
almost
a
stranger
by
purchasing
with
paper
shares
by
hundreds
in
the
schemes
to
execute
which
he
contracts
and
which
are
his
own
devising
which
shares
he
sells
as
soon
as
they
are
at
a
high
premium
to
which
they
are
speedily
forced
by
means
of
paragraphs
inserted
by
himself
and
agents
in
newspapers
devoted
to
his
interest
utterly
reckless
of
the
terrible
depreciation
to
which
they
are
almost
instantly
subjected
but
he
is
worth
a
million
pounds
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
fact
he
has
not
made
fortunes
at
least
those
whose
fortunes
it
was
said
he
would
make
he
has
made
them
away
but
his
own
he
has
made
emphatically
made
it
he
is
worth
a
million
pounds
hurrah
for
the
millionnaire
the
clown
who
views
the
pandemonium
of
red
brick
which
he
has
built
on
the
estate
which
he
has
purchased
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
place
of
his
grand
debut
in
which
every
species
of
architecture
greek
indian
and
chinese
is
employed
in
caricature
who
hears
of
the
grand
entertainment
he
gives
at
christmas
in
the
principal
the
hundred
the
of
plate
and
the
ocean
of
wine
which
form
parts
of
it
and
above
all
the
two
ostrich
poults
one
at
the
head
and
the
other
at
the
foot
of
the
table
exclaims
well
if
he
bang
up
i
do
know
who
be
why
he
beats
my
lord
hollow
the
mechanic
of
the
borough
town
who
sees
him
dashing
through
the
streets
in
an
open
landau
drawn
by
four
horses
amidst
his
attendant
his
wife
a
monster
of
a
woman
by
his
side
stout
as
the
wife
of
tamerlane
who
weighed
twenty
stone
and
bedizened
out
like
her
whose
person
shone
with
the
jewels
of
plundered
persia
stares
with
silent
wonder
and
at
last
exclaims
that
the
man
for
my
vote
you
tell
the
clown
that
the
man
of
the
mansion
has
contributed
enormously
to
corrupt
the
rural
innocence
of
england
you
point
to
an
incipient
branch
railroad
from
around
which
the
accents
of
gomorrah
are
sounding
and
beg
him
to
listen
for
a
moment
and
then
close
his
ears
hodge
scratches
his
head
and
says
well
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
that
all
i
know
is
that
he
is
bang
up
and
i
wish
i
were
he
perhaps
he
will
add
a
hodge
has
been
known
to
add
he
has
been
kind
enough
to
put
my
son
on
that
very
railroad
is
true
the
company
is
somewhat
queer
and
the
work
rather
killing
but
he
gets
there
a
day
whereas
from
the
farmers
he
would
only
get
pence
you
remind
the
mechanic
that
the
man
in
the
landau
has
been
the
ruin
of
thousands
and
you
mention
people
whom
he
himself
knows
people
in
various
grades
of
life
widows
and
orphans
amongst
them
whose
little
all
has
been
dissipated
and
whom
he
has
reduced
to
beggary
by
inducing
them
to
become
sharers
in
his
delusive
schemes
but
the
mechanic
says
well
the
more
fools
they
to
let
themselves
be
robbed
but
i
do
call
that
kind
of
thing
robbery
i
merely
call
it
and
everybody
in
this
free
country
has
a
right
to
outwit
others
if
he
can
what
a
out
he
has
one
was
once
heard
to
add
i
never
saw
a
more
man
in
all
my
life
except
one
and
that
was
a
walley
who
was
much
like
him
it
is
true
that
he
is
rather
but
then
madam
you
know
makes
up
for
all
chapter
v
subject
of
gentility
continued
in
the
last
chapter
have
been
exhibited
specimens
of
gentility
so
considered
by
different
classes
by
one
class
power
youth
and
epaulets
are
considered
the
ne
plus
ultra
of
gentility
by
another
class
pride
stateliness
and
title
by
another
wealth
and
flaming
tawdriness
but
what
constitutes
a
gentleman
it
is
easy
to
say
at
once
what
constitutes
a
gentleman
and
there
are
no
distinctions
in
what
is
gentlemanly
as
there
are
in
what
is
genteel
the
characteristics
of
a
gentleman
are
high
feeling
a
determination
never
to
take
a
cowardly
advantage
of
another
a
liberal
education
absence
of
narrow
views
generosity
and
courage
propriety
of
behaviour
now
a
person
may
be
genteel
according
to
one
or
another
of
the
three
standards
described
above
and
not
possess
one
of
the
characteristics
of
a
gentleman
is
the
emperor
a
gentleman
with
spatters
of
blood
on
his
clothes
scourged
from
the
backs
of
noble
hungarian
women
are
the
aristocracy
gentlefolks
who
admire
him
is
flamson
a
gentleman
although
he
has
a
million
pounds
no
cowardly
miscreants
admirers
of
cowardly
miscreants
and
people
who
make
a
million
pounds
by
means
compared
with
which
those
employed
to
make
fortunes
by
the
getters
up
of
the
south
sea
bubble
might
be
called
honest
dealing
are
decidedly
not
gentlefolks
now
as
it
is
clearly
demonstrable
that
a
person
may
be
perfectly
genteel
according
to
some
standard
or
other
and
yet
be
no
gentleman
so
it
is
demonstrable
that
a
person
may
have
no
pretensions
to
gentility
and
yet
be
a
gentleman
for
example
there
is
lavengro
would
the
admirers
of
the
emperor
or
the
admirers
of
those
who
admire
the
emperor
or
the
admirers
of
flamson
call
him
genteel
and
gentility
with
them
is
everything
assuredly
they
would
not
and
assuredly
they
would
consider
him
respectively
as
a
being
to
be
shunned
despised
or
hooted
genteel
why
at
one
time
he
is
a
hack
author
writes
reviewals
for
eighteenpence
a
page
edits
a
newgate
chronicle
at
another
he
wanders
the
country
with
a
face
grimy
from
occasionally
mending
kettles
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
his
clothes
are
not
seedy
and
torn
and
his
shoes
down
at
the
heel
but
by
what
process
of
reasoning
will
they
prove
that
he
is
no
gentleman
is
he
not
learned
has
he
not
generosity
and
courage
whilst
a
hack
author
does
he
pawn
the
books
entrusted
to
him
to
review
does
he
break
his
word
to
his
publisher
does
he
write
begging
letters
does
he
get
clothes
or
lodgings
without
paying
for
them
again
whilst
a
wanderer
does
he
insult
helpless
women
on
the
road
with
loose
proposals
or
ribald
discourse
does
he
take
what
is
not
his
own
from
the
hedges
does
he
play
on
the
fiddle
or
make
faces
in
in
order
to
obtain
pence
or
beer
or
does
he
call
for
liquor
swallow
it
and
then
say
to
a
widowed
landlady
mistress
i
have
no
brass
in
a
word
what
vice
and
crime
does
he
perpetrate
what
low
acts
does
he
commit
therefore
with
his
endowments
who
will
venture
to
say
that
he
is
no
gentleman
unless
it
be
an
admirer
of
flamson
a
clown
who
will
perhaps
shout
i
say
he
is
no
gentleman
for
who
can
be
a
gentleman
who
keeps
no
gig
the
indifference
exhibited
by
lavengro
for
what
is
merely
genteel
compared
with
his
solicitude
never
to
infringe
the
strict
laws
of
honour
should
read
a
salutary
lesson
the
generality
of
his
countrymen
are
far
more
careful
not
to
transgress
the
customs
of
what
they
call
gentility
than
to
violate
the
laws
of
honour
or
morality
they
will
shrink
from
carrying
their
own
and
from
speaking
to
a
person
in
seedy
raiment
whilst
to
matters
of
much
higher
importance
they
are
shamelessly
indifferent
not
so
lavengro
he
will
do
anything
that
he
deems
convenient
or
which
strikes
his
fancy
provided
it
does
not
outrage
decency
or
is
unallied
to
profligacy
is
not
ashamed
to
speak
to
a
beggar
in
rags
and
will
associate
with
anybody
provided
he
can
gratify
a
laudable
curiosity
he
has
no
abstract
love
for
what
is
low
or
what
the
world
calls
low
he
sees
that
many
things
which
the
world
looks
down
upon
are
valuable
so
he
prizes
much
which
the
world
condemns
he
sees
that
many
things
which
the
world
admires
are
contemptible
so
he
despises
much
which
the
world
does
not
but
when
the
world
prizes
what
is
really
excellent
he
does
not
contemn
it
because
the
world
regards
it
if
he
learns
irish
which
all
the
world
scoffs
at
he
likewise
learns
italian
which
all
the
world
melts
at
if
he
learns
gypsy
the
language
of
the
tattered
tent
he
likewise
learns
greek
the
language
of
the
if
he
learns
smithery
he
also
learns
ah
what
does
he
learn
to
set
against
smithery
the
law
no
he
does
not
learn
the
law
which
by
the
way
is
not
very
genteel
swimming
yes
he
learns
to
swim
swimming
however
is
not
genteel
and
the
world
at
least
the
genteel
part
of
it
acts
very
wisely
in
setting
its
face
against
it
for
to
swim
you
must
be
naked
and
how
would
many
a
genteel
person
look
without
his
clothes
come
he
learns
horsemanship
a
very
genteel
accomplishment
which
every
genteel
person
would
gladly
possess
though
not
all
genteel
people
do
again
as
to
associates
if
he
holds
communion
when
a
boy
with
murtagh
the
scarecrow
of
an
irish
academy
he
associates
in
after
life
with
francis
ardry
a
rich
and
talented
young
irish
gentleman
about
town
if
he
accepts
an
invitation
from
petulengro
to
his
tent
he
has
no
objection
to
go
home
with
a
rich
genius
to
dinner
who
then
will
say
that
he
prizes
a
thing
or
a
person
because
they
are
ungenteel
that
he
is
not
ready
to
take
up
with
everything
that
is
ungenteel
he
gives
a
proof
when
he
refuses
though
on
the
brink
of
starvation
to
become
bonnet
to
the
an
office
which
though
profitable
is
positively
ungenteel
ah
but
some
for
gentility
will
exclaim
the
hero
did
not
refuse
this
office
from
an
insurmountable
dislike
to
its
ungentility
but
merely
from
a
feeling
of
principle
well
the
writer
is
not
fond
of
argument
and
he
will
admit
that
such
was
the
case
he
admits
that
it
was
a
love
of
principle
rather
than
an
for
gentility
which
prevented
the
hero
from
accepting
when
on
the
brink
of
starvation
an
ungenteel
though
lucrative
office
an
office
which
the
writer
begs
leave
to
observe
many
a
person
with
a
great
regard
for
gentility
and
no
particular
regard
for
principle
would
in
a
similar
strait
have
accepted
for
when
did
a
mere
love
for
gentility
keep
a
person
from
being
a
dirty
scoundrel
when
the
alternatives
were
either
be
a
dirty
scoundrel
or
starve
one
thing
however
is
certain
which
is
that
lavengro
did
not
accept
the
office
which
if
a
love
for
what
is
low
had
been
his
ruling
passion
he
certainly
would
have
done
consequently
he
refuses
to
do
one
thing
which
no
genteel
person
would
willingly
do
even
as
he
does
many
things
which
every
genteel
person
would
gladly
do
for
example
speaks
italian
rides
on
horseback
associates
with
a
fashionable
young
man
dines
with
a
rich
genius
et
cetera
yet
and
it
can
not
be
minced
he
and
gentility
with
regard
to
many
things
are
at
strange
divergency
he
shrinks
from
many
things
at
which
gentility
placidly
hums
a
tune
or
approvingly
simpers
and
does
some
things
at
which
gentility
positively
shrinks
he
will
not
run
into
debt
for
clothes
or
lodgings
which
he
might
do
without
any
scandal
to
gentility
he
will
not
receive
money
from
francis
ardry
and
go
to
brighton
with
the
sister
of
annette
le
noir
though
there
is
nothing
ungenteel
in
borrowing
money
from
a
friend
even
when
you
never
intend
to
repay
him
and
something
poignantly
genteel
in
going
to
a
with
a
gay
young
frenchwoman
but
he
has
no
objection
after
raising
twenty
pounds
by
the
sale
of
that
extraordinary
work
joseph
sell
to
set
off
into
the
country
mend
kettles
under
and
make
pony
and
donkey
shoes
in
a
dingle
here
perhaps
some
plain
person
will
cry
and
with
much
apparent
justice
how
can
the
writer
justify
him
in
this
act
what
motive
save
a
love
for
what
is
low
could
induce
him
to
do
such
a
thing
would
the
writer
have
everybody
who
is
in
need
of
recreation
go
into
the
country
mend
kettles
under
hedges
and
make
pony
shoes
in
dingles
to
such
an
observation
the
writer
would
answer
that
lavengro
had
an
excellent
motive
in
doing
what
he
did
but
that
the
writer
is
not
so
unreasonable
as
to
wish
everybody
to
do
the
same
it
is
not
everybody
who
can
mend
kettles
it
is
not
everybody
who
is
in
similar
circumstances
to
those
in
which
lavengro
was
lavengro
flies
from
london
and
hack
authorship
and
takes
to
the
roads
from
fear
of
consumption
it
is
expensive
to
put
up
at
inns
and
even
at
houses
and
lavengro
has
not
much
money
so
he
buys
a
tinker
cart
and
apparatus
and
sets
up
as
tinker
and
subsequently
as
blacksmith
a
person
living
in
a
tent
or
in
anything
else
must
do
something
or
go
mad
lavengro
had
a
mind
as
he
himself
well
knew
with
some
slight
tendency
to
madness
and
had
he
not
employed
himself
he
must
have
gone
wild
so
to
employ
himself
he
drew
upon
one
of
his
resources
the
only
one
available
at
the
time
authorship
had
nearly
killed
him
he
was
sick
of
reading
and
had
besides
no
books
but
he
possessed
the
rudiments
of
an
art
akin
to
tinkering
he
knew
something
of
smithery
having
served
a
kind
of
apprenticeship
in
ireland
to
a
fairy
smith
so
he
draws
upon
his
smithery
to
enable
him
to
acquire
tinkering
he
speedily
acquires
that
craft
even
as
he
had
speedily
acquired
welsh
owing
to
its
connection
with
irish
which
language
he
possessed
and
with
tinkering
he
amuses
himself
until
he
lays
it
aside
to
resume
smithery
a
man
who
has
an
innocent
resource
has
quite
as
much
right
to
draw
upon
it
in
need
as
he
has
upon
a
banker
in
whose
hands
he
has
placed
a
sum
lavengro
turns
to
advantage
under
particular
circumstances
a
certain
resource
which
he
has
but
people
who
are
not
so
forlorn
as
lavengro
and
have
not
served
the
same
apprenticeship
which
he
had
are
not
advised
to
follow
his
example
surely
he
was
better
employed
in
plying
the
trades
of
tinker
and
smith
than
in
having
recourse
to
vice
in
running
after
for
example
running
after
is
by
no
means
an
ungenteel
rural
diversion
but
let
any
one
ask
some
respectable
casuist
the
bishop
of
london
for
example
whether
lavengro
was
not
far
better
employed
when
in
the
country
at
tinkering
and
smithery
than
he
would
have
been
in
running
after
all
the
in
cheshire
though
tinkering
is
in
general
considered
a
very
ungenteel
employment
and
smithery
little
better
notwithstanding
that
an
orcadian
poet
who
wrote
in
norse
about
eight
hundred
years
ago
reckons
the
latter
among
nine
noble
arts
which
he
possessed
naming
it
along
with
playing
at
chess
on
the
harp
and
ravelling
runes
or
as
the
original
has
it
treading
runes
that
is
compressing
them
into
a
small
compass
by
mingling
one
letter
with
another
even
as
the
turkish
caligraphists
ravel
the
arabic
letters
more
especially
those
who
write
talismans
nine
arts
have
i
all
noble
i
play
at
chess
so
free
at
ravelling
runes
i
ready
at
books
and
smithery
i
skilled
ice
at
skimming
on
skates
i
shoot
and
row
and
few
at
harping
match
me
or
minstrelsy
i
trow
but
though
lavengro
takes
up
smithery
which
though
the
orcadian
ranks
it
with
and
harping
is
certainly
somewhat
of
a
grimy
art
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
had
he
been
wealthy
and
not
so
forlorn
as
he
was
he
would
have
turned
to
many
things
honourable
of
course
in
preference
he
has
no
objection
to
ride
a
fine
horse
when
he
has
the
opportunity
he
has
his
of
making
a
fortune
of
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
by
becoming
a
merchant
and
doing
business
after
the
armenian
fashion
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
would
have
been
glad
to
wear
fine
clothes
provided
he
had
had
sufficient
funds
to
authorize
him
in
wearing
them
for
the
sake
of
wandering
the
country
and
plying
the
hammer
and
tongs
he
would
not
have
refused
a
commission
in
the
service
of
that
illustrious
monarch
george
the
fourth
provided
he
had
thought
that
he
could
live
on
his
pay
and
not
be
forced
to
run
in
debt
to
tradesmen
without
any
hope
of
paying
them
for
clothes
and
luxuries
as
many
highly
genteel
officers
in
that
honourable
service
were
in
the
habit
of
doing
for
the
sake
of
tinkering
he
would
certainly
not
have
refused
a
secretaryship
of
an
embassy
to
persia
in
which
he
might
have
turned
his
acquaintance
with
persian
arabic
and
the
lord
only
knows
what
other
languages
to
account
he
took
to
tinkering
and
smithery
because
no
better
employments
were
at
his
command
no
war
is
waged
in
the
book
against
rank
wealth
fine
clothes
or
dignified
employments
it
is
shown
however
that
a
person
may
be
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
without
them
rank
wealth
fine
clothes
and
dignified
employments
are
no
doubt
very
fine
things
but
they
are
merely
externals
they
do
not
make
a
gentleman
they
add
external
grace
and
dignity
to
the
gentleman
and
scholar
but
they
make
neither
and
is
it
not
better
to
be
a
gentleman
without
them
than
not
a
gentleman
with
them
is
not
lavengro
when
he
leaves
london
on
foot
with
twenty
pounds
in
his
pocket
entitled
to
more
respect
than
flamson
flaming
in
his
coach
with
a
million
and
is
not
even
the
honest
jockey
at
horncastle
who
offers
a
fair
price
to
lavengro
for
his
horse
entitled
to
more
than
the
scoundrel
lord
who
attempts
to
cheat
him
of
of
its
value
millions
however
seem
to
think
otherwise
by
their
servile
adoration
of
people
whom
without
rank
wealth
and
fine
clothes
they
would
consider
infamous
but
whom
possessed
of
rank
wealth
and
glittering
habiliments
they
seem
to
admire
all
the
more
for
their
profligacy
and
crimes
does
not
a
or
a
on
the
clothes
of
a
blooming
emperor
give
a
kind
of
zest
to
the
genteel
young
god
do
not
the
pride
superciliousness
and
selfishness
of
a
certain
aristocracy
make
it
all
the
more
regarded
by
its
worshippers
and
do
not
the
clownish
and
blood
admirers
of
flamson
like
him
all
the
more
because
they
are
conscious
that
he
is
a
knave
if
such
is
the
case
and
alas
is
it
not
the
case
they
can
not
be
too
frequently
told
that
fine
clothes
wealth
and
titles
adorn
a
person
in
proportion
as
he
adorns
them
that
if
worn
by
the
magnanimous
and
good
they
are
ornaments
indeed
but
if
by
the
vile
and
profligate
they
are
merely
san
benitos
and
only
serve
to
make
their
infamy
doubly
apparent
and
that
a
person
in
seedy
raiment
and
tattered
hat
possessed
of
courage
kindness
and
virtue
is
entitled
to
more
respect
from
those
to
whom
his
virtues
are
manifested
than
any
cruel
profligate
emperor
selfish
aristocrat
or
knavish
millionaire
in
the
world
the
writer
has
no
intention
of
saying
that
all
in
england
are
affected
with
the
absurd
mania
for
gentility
nor
is
such
a
statement
made
in
the
book
it
is
shown
therein
that
individuals
of
certain
classes
can
prize
a
gentleman
notwithstanding
seedy
raiment
dusty
shoes
or
tattered
hat
for
example
the
young
irishman
the
rich
genius
the
postillion
and
his
employer
again
when
the
life
of
the
hero
is
given
to
the
world
amidst
the
howl
about
its
lowness
and
vulgarity
raised
by
the
servile
crew
whom
its
independence
of
sentiment
has
stung
more
than
one
powerful
voice
has
been
heard
testifying
approbation
of
its
learning
and
the
purity
of
its
morality
that
there
is
some
salt
in
england
minds
not
swayed
by
mere
externals
he
is
fully
convinced
if
he
were
not
he
would
spare
himself
the
trouble
of
writing
but
to
the
fact
that
the
generality
of
his
countrymen
are
basely
grovelling
before
the
shrine
of
what
they
are
pleased
to
call
gentility
he
can
not
shut
his
eyes
oh
what
a
clever
person
that
cockney
was
who
travelling
in
the
aberdeen
railroad
carriage
after
edifying
the
company
with
his
remarks
on
various
subjects
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
lieutenant
p
would
in
future
be
shunned
by
all
respectable
society
and
what
a
simple
person
that
elderly
gentleman
was
who
abruptly
starting
asked
in
rather
an
authoritative
voice
and
why
should
lieutenant
p
be
shunned
by
respectable
society
and
who
after
entering
into
what
was
said
to
be
a
masterly
analysis
of
the
entire
evidence
of
the
case
concluded
by
stating
that
having
been
accustomed
to
all
kinds
of
evidence
all
his
life
he
had
never
known
a
case
in
which
the
accused
had
obtained
a
more
complete
and
triumphant
justification
than
lieutenant
p
had
done
in
the
late
trial
now
the
cockney
who
is
said
to
have
been
a
very
foppish
cockney
was
perfectly
right
in
what
he
said
and
therein
manifested
a
knowledge
of
the
english
mind
and
character
and
likewise
of
the
modern
english
language
to
which
his
catechist
who
it
seems
was
a
distinguished
member
of
the
scottish
bar
could
lay
no
pretensions
the
cockney
knew
what
the
lord
of
session
knew
not
that
the
british
public
is
gentility
crazy
and
he
knew
moreover
that
gentility
and
respectability
are
synonymous
no
one
in
england
is
genteel
or
respectable
that
is
looked
at
who
is
the
victim
of
oppression
he
may
be
pitied
for
a
time
but
when
did
not
pity
terminate
in
contempt
a
poor
harmless
young
officer
but
why
enter
into
the
details
of
the
infamous
case
they
are
but
too
well
known
and
if
ever
cruelty
pride
and
cowardice
and
things
much
worse
than
even
cruelty
cowardice
and
pride
were
brought
to
light
and
at
the
same
time
countenanced
they
were
in
that
case
what
availed
the
triumphant
justification
of
the
poor
victim
there
was
at
first
a
roar
of
indignation
against
his
oppressors
but
how
long
did
it
last
he
had
been
turned
out
of
the
service
they
remained
in
it
with
their
red
coats
and
epaulets
he
was
merely
the
son
of
a
man
who
had
rendered
good
service
to
his
country
they
were
for
the
most
part
highly
connected
they
were
in
the
extremest
degree
genteel
he
quite
the
reverse
so
the
nation
wavered
considered
thought
the
genteel
side
was
the
safest
after
all
and
then
with
the
cry
of
oh
there
is
nothing
like
gentility
ratted
bodily
newspaper
and
public
turned
against
the
victim
scouted
him
apologized
for
the
what
should
they
be
called
who
were
not
only
admitted
into
the
most
respectable
society
but
courted
to
come
the
spots
not
merely
of
wine
on
their
military
clothes
giving
them
a
kind
of
poignancy
but
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
the
british
glories
are
tarnished
providence
has
never
smiled
on
british
arms
since
that
case
oh
balaklava
thy
name
interpreted
is
net
of
fishes
and
well
dost
thou
deserve
that
name
how
many
a
scarlet
golden
fish
has
of
late
perished
in
the
mud
amidst
thee
cursing
the
genteel
service
and
the
genteel
leader
which
brought
him
to
such
a
doom
whether
the
rage
for
gentility
is
most
prevalent
amongst
the
upper
middle
or
lower
classes
it
is
difficult
to
say
the
priest
in
the
text
seems
to
think
that
it
is
exhibited
in
the
most
decided
manner
in
the
middle
class
it
is
the
writer
opinion
however
that
in
no
class
is
it
more
strongly
developed
than
in
the
lower
what
they
call
being
goes
a
great
way
amongst
them
but
the
possession
of
money
much
farther
whence
flamson
influence
over
them
their
rage
against
and
scorn
for
any
person
who
by
his
courage
and
talents
has
advanced
himself
in
life
and
still
remains
poor
are
indescribable
he
is
no
better
than
ourselves
they
say
why
should
he
be
above
us
for
they
have
no
conception
that
anybody
has
a
right
to
ascendency
over
themselves
except
by
birth
or
money
this
feeling
amongst
the
vulgar
has
been
to
a
certain
extent
the
bane
of
two
services
naval
and
military
the
writer
does
not
make
this
assertion
rashly
he
observed
this
feeling
at
work
in
the
army
when
a
child
and
he
has
good
reason
for
believing
that
it
was
as
strongly
at
work
in
the
navy
at
the
same
time
and
is
still
as
prevalent
in
both
why
are
not
brave
men
raised
from
the
ranks
is
frequently
the
cry
why
are
not
brave
sailors
promoted
the
lord
help
brave
soldiers
and
sailors
who
are
promoted
they
have
less
to
undergo
from
the
high
airs
of
their
brother
officers
and
those
are
hard
enough
to
endure
than
from
the
insolence
of
the
men
soldiers
and
sailors
promoted
to
command
are
said
to
be
in
general
tyrants
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
when
they
are
tyrants
they
have
been
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
extreme
severity
in
order
to
protect
themselves
from
the
insolence
and
mutinous
spirit
of
the
men
he
is
no
better
than
ourselves
shoot
him
bayonet
him
or
fling
him
overboard
they
say
of
some
obnoxious
individual
raised
above
them
by
his
merit
soldiers
and
sailors
in
general
will
bear
any
amount
of
tyranny
from
a
lordly
sot
or
the
son
of
a
man
who
has
plenty
of
brass
their
own
term
but
will
mutiny
against
the
just
orders
of
a
skilful
and
brave
officer
who
is
no
better
than
themselves
there
was
the
affair
of
the
bounty
for
example
bligh
was
one
of
the
best
seamen
that
ever
trod
deck
and
one
of
the
bravest
of
men
proofs
of
his
seamanship
he
gave
by
steering
amidst
dreadful
weather
a
boat
for
nearly
four
thousand
miles
over
an
almost
unknown
ocean
of
his
bravery
at
the
fight
of
copenhagen
one
of
the
most
desperate
ever
fought
of
which
after
nelson
he
was
the
hero
he
was
moreover
not
an
unkind
man
but
the
crew
of
the
bounty
mutinied
against
him
and
set
him
half
naked
in
an
open
boat
with
certain
of
his
men
who
remained
faithful
to
him
and
ran
away
with
the
ship
their
principal
motive
for
doing
so
was
an
idea
whether
true
or
groundless
the
writer
can
not
say
that
bligh
was
no
better
than
themselves
he
was
certainly
neither
a
lord
illegitimate
nor
possessed
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
the
writer
knows
what
he
is
writing
about
having
been
acquainted
in
his
early
years
with
an
individual
who
was
turned
adrift
with
bligh
and
who
died
about
the
year
a
lieutenant
in
the
navy
in
a
provincial
town
in
which
the
writer
was
brought
up
the
ringleaders
in
the
mutiny
were
two
scoundrels
christian
and
young
who
had
great
influence
with
the
crew
because
they
were
genteelly
connected
bligh
after
leaving
the
bounty
had
considerable
difficulty
in
managing
the
men
who
had
shared
his
fate
because
they
considered
themselves
as
good
men
as
he
notwithstanding
that
to
his
conduct
and
seamanship
they
had
alone
to
look
under
heaven
for
salvation
from
the
ghastly
perils
that
surrounded
them
bligh
himself
in
his
journal
alludes
to
this
feeling
once
when
he
and
his
companions
landed
on
a
desert
island
one
of
them
said
with
a
mutinous
look
that
he
considered
himself
as
good
a
man
as
he
bligh
seizing
a
cutlass
called
upon
him
to
take
another
and
defend
himself
whereupon
the
man
said
that
bligh
was
going
to
kill
him
and
made
all
manner
of
concessions
now
why
did
this
fellow
consider
himself
as
good
a
man
as
bligh
was
he
as
good
a
seaman
no
nor
a
tenth
part
as
good
as
brave
a
man
no
nor
a
tenth
part
as
brave
and
of
these
facts
he
was
perfectly
well
aware
but
bravery
and
seamanship
stood
for
nothing
with
him
as
they
still
stand
with
thousands
of
his
class
bligh
was
not
genteel
by
birth
or
money
therefore
bligh
was
no
better
than
himself
had
bligh
before
he
sailed
got
a
pound
prize
in
the
lottery
he
would
have
experienced
no
insolence
from
this
fellow
for
there
would
have
been
no
mutiny
in
the
bounty
he
is
our
betters
the
crew
would
have
said
and
it
is
our
duty
to
obey
him
the
wonderful
power
of
gentility
in
england
is
exemplified
in
nothing
more
than
in
what
it
is
producing
amongst
jews
gypsies
and
quakers
it
is
breaking
up
their
venerable
communities
all
the
better
some
one
will
say
alas
alas
it
is
making
the
wealthy
jews
forsake
the
synagogue
for
the
or
the
gentility
chapel
in
which
a
disciple
of
platitude
in
a
white
surplice
preaches
a
sermon
at
day
from
a
desk
on
each
side
of
which
is
a
flaming
taper
it
is
making
them
abandon
their
ancient
literature
their
mischna
their
gemara
their
zohar
for
gentility
novels
the
young
duke
the
most
unexceptionably
genteel
book
ever
written
being
the
principal
favourite
it
makes
the
young
jew
ashamed
of
the
young
jewess
it
makes
her
ashamed
of
the
young
jew
the
young
jew
marries
an
or
if
the
dancer
will
not
have
him
as
is
frequently
the
case
the
miss
of
the
honourable
spencer
it
makes
the
young
jewess
accept
the
honourable
offer
of
a
cashiered
lieutenant
of
the
bengal
native
infantry
or
if
such
a
person
does
not
come
forward
the
dishonourable
offer
of
a
cornet
of
a
regiment
of
crack
hussars
it
makes
poor
jews
male
and
female
forsake
the
synagogue
for
the
sixpenny
theatre
or
penny
hop
the
jew
to
take
up
with
an
irish
female
of
loose
character
and
the
jewess
with
a
musician
of
the
guards
or
the
tipperary
servant
of
captain
mulligan
with
respect
to
the
gypsies
it
is
making
the
women
what
they
never
were
before
harlots
and
the
men
what
they
never
were
before
careless
fathers
and
husbands
it
has
made
the
daughter
of
ursula

up
with
the

it
makes
gorgiko
brown
the
gypsy
man
leave
his
tent

an
evening
and
thrust
himself
into
society
which
could
well
dispense
with
him
brother
said
petulengro
to
the
romany
rye
after
telling
him
many
things
connected
with
the
decadence
of
gypsyism
there
is
one
gorgiko
brown
who
with
a
face
as
black
as
a
wishes
to
be
mistaken
for
a
christian
tradesman
he
goes
into
the
parlour
of
a
inn
of
an
evening
calls
for
rum
and
water
and
attempts
to
enter
into
conversation
with
the
company
about
politics
and
business
the
company
flout
him
and
give
him
the
cold
shoulder
or
perhaps
complain
to
the
landlord
who
comes
and
asks
him
what
business
he
has
in
the
parlour
telling
him
if
he
wants
to
drink
to
go
into
the
and
perhaps
collars
him
and
kicks
him
out
provided
he
refuses
to
move
with
respect
to
the
quakers
it
makes
the
young
people
like
the
young
jews
crazy
after
gentility
diversions
worship
marriages
or
connections
and
makes
old
pease
do
what
it
makes
gorgiko
brown
do
thrust
himself
into
society
which
could
well
dispense
with
him
and
out
of
which
he
is
not
kicked
because
unlike
the
gypsy
he
is
not
poor
the
writer
would
say
much
more
on
these
points
but
want
of
room
prevents
him
he
must
therefore
request
the
reader
to
have
patience
until
he
can
lay
before
the
world
a
pamphlet
which
he
has
been
long
meditating
to
be
entitled
remarks
on
the
strikingly
similar
effects
which
a
love
for
gentility
has
produced
and
is
producing
amongst
jews
gypsies
and
quakers
the
priest
in
the
book
has
much
to
say
on
the
subject
of
this
nonsense
no
person
can
possibly
despise
it
more
thoroughly
than
that
very
remarkable
individual
seems
to
do
yet
he
hails
its
prevalence
with
pleasure
knowing
the
benefits
which
will
result
from
it
to
the
church
of
which
he
is
the
sneering
slave
the
english
are
mad
after
gentility
says
he
well
all
the
better
for
us
their
religion
for
a
long
time
past
has
been
a
plain
and
simple
one
and
consequently
by
no
means
genteel
they
quit
it
for
ours
which
is
the
perfection
of
what
they
admire
with
which
templars
hospitalers
mitred
abbots
gothic
abbeys
aisles
golden
censers
incense
et
cetera
are
connected
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
of
christ
it
is
true
but
weighed
in
the
balance
against
gentility
where
will
christianity
be
why
kicking
against
the
beam
ho
ho
and
in
connection
with
the
he
expatiates
largely
and
with
much
contempt
on
a
species
of
literature
by
which
the
interests
of
his
church
in
england
have
been
very
much
advanced
all
genuine
priests
have
a
thorough
contempt
for
everything
which
tends
to
advance
the
interests
of
their
church
this
literature
is
made
up
of
pseudo
jacobitism
charlie
the
waterism
or
nonsense
about
charlie
the
water
and
the
writer
will
now
take
the
liberty
of
saying
a
few
words
about
it
on
his
own
account
chapter
vi
on
scotch
charlie
the
waterism
of
the
literature
just
alluded
to
scott
was
the
inventor
it
is
founded
on
the
fortunes
and
misfortunes
of
the
stuart
family
of
which
scott
was
the
zealous
defender
and
apologist
doing
all
that
in
his
power
lay
to
represent
the
members
of
it
as
noble
chivalrous
unfortunate
princes
though
perhaps
of
all
the
royal
families
that
ever
existed
upon
the
earth
this
family
was
the
worst
it
was
unfortunate
enough
it
is
true
but
it
owed
its
misfortunes
entirely
to
its
crimes
viciousness
bad
faith
and
cowardice
nothing
will
be
said
of
it
here
until
it
made
its
appearance
in
england
to
occupy
the
english
throne
the
first
of
the
family
which
we
have
to
do
with
james
was
a
dirty
cowardly
miscreant
of
whom
the
less
said
the
better
his
son
charles
the
first
was
a
tyrant
exceedingly
cruel
and
revengeful
but
weak
and
dastardly
he
caused
a
poor
fellow
to
be
hanged
in
london
who
was
not
his
subject
because
he
had
heard
that
the
unfortunate
creature
had
once
bitten
his
own
glove
at
cadiz
in
spain
at
the
mention
of
his
name
and
he
permitted
his
own
strafford
to
be
executed
by
his
own
enemies
though
the
only
crime
of
strafford
was
that
he
had
barked
furiously
at
those
enemies
and
had
worried
two
or
three
of
them
when
charles
shouted
fetch
he
was
a
bitter
but
yet
a
despicable
enemy
and
the
coldest
and
most
worthless
of
friends
for
though
he
always
hoped
to
be
able
some
time
or
other
to
hang
his
enemies
he
was
always
ready
to
curry
favour
with
them
more
especially
if
he
could
do
so
at
the
expense
of
his
friends
he
was
the
haughtiest
yet
meanest
of
mankind
he
once
caned
a
young
nobleman
for
appearing
before
him
in
the
not
dressed
exactly
according
to
the
court
etiquette
yet
he
condescended
to
flatter
and
compliment
him
who
from
principle
was
his
bitterest
enemy
namely
harrison
when
the
republican
colonel
was
conducting
him
as
a
prisoner
to
london
his
bad
faith
was
notorious
it
was
from
abhorrence
of
the
first
public
instance
which
he
gave
of
his
bad
faith
his
breaking
his
word
to
the
infanta
of
spain
that
the
poor
bit
his
glove
at
cadiz
and
it
was
his
notorious
bad
faith
which
eventually
cost
him
his
head
for
the
republicans
would
gladly
have
spared
him
provided
they
could
put
the
slightest
confidence
in
any
promise
however
solemn
which
he
might
have
made
to
them
of
them
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
whether
they
most
hated
or
despised
him
religion
he
had
none
one
day
he
favoured
popery
the
next
on
hearing
certain
clamours
of
the
people
he
sent
his
wife
domestics
back
packing
to
france
because
they
were
papists
papists
however
should
make
him
a
saint
for
he
was
certainly
the
cause
of
the
taking
of
rochelle
his
son
charles
the
second
though
he
passed
his
youth
in
the
school
of
adversity
learned
no
other
lesson
from
it
than
the
following
one
take
care
of
yourself
and
never
do
an
action
either
good
or
bad
which
is
likely
to
bring
you
into
any
great
difficulty
and
this
maxim
he
acted
up
to
as
soon
as
he
came
to
the
throne
he
was
a
papist
but
took
especial
care
not
to
acknowledge
his
religion
at
which
he
frequently
scoffed
till
just
before
his
last
gasp
when
he
knew
that
he
could
lose
nothing
and
hoped
to
gain
everything
by
it
he
was
always
in
want
of
money
but
took
care
not
to
tax
the
country
beyond
all
endurable
bounds
preferring
to
such
a
bold
and
dangerous
course
to
become
the
pensioner
of
louis
to
whom
in
return
for
his
gold
he
sacrificed
the
honour
and
interests
of
britain
he
was
too
lazy
and
sensual
to
delight
in
playing
the
part
of
a
tyrant
himself
but
he
never
checked
tyranny
in
others
save
in
one
instance
he
permitted
beastly
butchers
to
commit
unmentionable
horrors
on
the
feeble
unarmed
and
disunited
covenanters
of
scotland
but
checked
them
when
they
would
fain
have
endeavoured
to
play
the
same
game
on
the
numerous
united
dogged
and
warlike
independents
of
england
to
show
his
filial
piety
he
bade
the
hangman
dishonour
the
corpses
of
some
of
his
father
judges
before
whom
when
alive
he
ran
like
a
screaming
hare
but
permitted
those
who
had
lost
their
all
in
supporting
his
father
cause
to
pine
in
misery
and
want
he
would
give
to
a
painted
harlot
a
thousand
pounds
for
a
loathsome
embrace
and
to
a
player
or
buffoon
a
hundred
for
a
trumpery
pun
but
would
refuse
a
penny
to
the
widow
or
orphan
of
an
old
royalist
soldier
he
was
the
personification
of
selfishness
and
as
he
loved
and
cared
for
no
one
so
did
no
one
love
or
care
for
him
so
little
had
he
gained
the
respect
or
affection
of
those
who
surrounded
him
that
after
his
body
had
undergone
an
examination
parts
of
it
were
thrown
down
the
sinks
of
the
palace
to
become
eventually
the
prey
of
the
swine
and
ducks
of
westminster
his
brother
who
succeeded
him
james
the
second
was
a
papist
but
sufficiently
honest
to
acknowledge
his
popery
but
upon
the
whole
he
was
a
poor
creature
though
a
tyrant
he
was
cowardly
had
he
not
been
a
coward
he
would
never
have
lost
his
throne
there
were
plenty
of
lovers
of
tyranny
in
england
who
would
have
stood
by
him
provided
he
would
have
stood
by
them
and
would
though
not
papists
have
encouraged
him
in
his
attempt
to
bring
back
england
beneath
the
sway
of
rome
and
perhaps
would
eventually
have
become
papists
themselves
but
the
nation
raising
a
cry
against
him
and
his
the
prince
of
orange
invading
the
country
he
forsook
his
friends
of
whom
he
had
a
host
but
for
whom
he
cared
little
left
his
throne
for
which
he
cared
a
great
deal
and
popery
in
england
for
which
he
cared
yet
more
to
their
fate
and
escaped
to
france
from
whence
after
taking
a
little
heart
he
repaired
to
ireland
where
he
was
speedily
joined
by
a
gallant
army
of
papists
whom
he
basely
abandoned
at
the
boyne
running
away
in
a
most
lamentable
condition
at
the
time
when
by
showing
a
little
courage
he
might
have
enabled
them
to
conquer
this
worthy
in
his
last
will
bequeathed
his
heart
to
england
his
right
arm
to
scotland
and
his
bowels
to
ireland
what
the
english
and
scotch
said
to
their
respective
bequests
is
not
known
but
it
is
certain
that
an
old
irish
priest
supposed
to
have
been
a
of
the
present
reverend
father
murtagh
on
hearing
of
the
bequest
to
ireland
fell
into
a
great
passion
and
having
been
brought
up
at
paris
and
salamanca
expressed
his
indignation
in
the
following
strain
malditas

tripas

his
son
generally
called
the
old
pretender
though
born
in
england
was
carried
in
his
infancy
to
france
where
he
was
brought
up
in
the
strictest
principles
of
popery
which
principles
however
did
not
prevent
him
becoming
when
did
they
ever
prevent
any
one
a
worthless
and
profligate
scoundrel
there
are
some
doubts
as
to
the
reality
of
his
being
a
son
of
james
which
doubts
are
probably
unfounded
the
grand
proof
of
his
legitimacy
being
the
thorough
baseness
of
his
character
it
was
said
of
his
father
that
he
could
speak
well
and
it
may
be
said
of
him
that
he
could
write
well
the
only
thing
he
could
do
which
was
worth
doing
always
supposing
that
there
is
any
merit
in
being
able
to
write
he
was
of
a
mean
appearance
and
like
his
father
pusillanimous
to
a
degree
the
meanness
of
his
appearance
disgusted
and
his
pusillanimity
discouraged
the
scotch
when
he
made
his
appearance
amongst
them
in
the
year
some
time
after
the
standard
of
rebellion
had
been
hoisted
by
mar
he
only
stayed
a
short
time
in
scotland
and
then
seized
with
panic
retreated
to
france
leaving
his
friends
to
shift
for
themselves
as
they
best
could
he
died
a
pensioner
of
the
pope
the
son
of
this
man
charles
edward
of
whom
so
much
in
later
years
has
been
said
and
written
was
a
worthless
ignorant
youth
and
a
profligate
and
illiterate
old
man
when
young
the
best
that
can
be
said
of
him
is
that
he
had
occasionally
springs
of
courage
invariably
at
the
wrong
time
and
place
which
merely
served
to
lead
his
friends
into
inextricable
difficulties
when
old
he
was
loathsome
and
contemptible
to
both
friend
and
foe
his
wife
loathed
him
and
for
the
most
terrible
of
reasons
she
did
not
pollute
his
couch
for
to
do
that
was
impossible
he
had
made
it
so
vile
but
she
betrayed
it
inviting
to
it
not
only
alfieri
the
filthy
but
the
coarsest
grooms
doctor
king
the
warmest
and
almost
last
adherent
of
his
family
said
that
there
was
not
a
vice
or
crime
of
which
he
was
not
guilty
as
for
his
foes
they
scorned
to
harm
him
even
when
in
their
power
in
the
year
he
came
down
from
the
highlands
of
scotland
which
had
long
been
a
focus
of
rebellion
he
was
attended
by
certain
clans
of
the
highlands
desperadoes
used
to
from
their
infancy
and
consequently
to
the
use
of
arms
and
possessed
of
a
certain
species
of
discipline
with
these
he
defeated
at
prestonpans
a
body
of
men
called
soldiers
but
who
were
in
reality
peasants
and
artizans
levied
about
a
month
before
without
discipline
or
confidence
in
each
other
and
who
were
miserably
massacred
by
the
highland
army
he
subsequently
invaded
england
nearly
destitute
of
regular
soldiers
and
penetrated
as
far
as
derby
from
which
place
he
retreated
on
learning
that
regular
forces
which
had
been
hastily
recalled
from
flanders
were
coming
against
him
with
the
duke
of
cumberland
at
their
head
he
was
pursued
and
his
rearguard
overtaken
and
defeated
by
the
dragoons
of
the
duke
at
clifton
from
which
place
the
rebels
retreated
in
great
confusion
across
the
eden
into
scotland
where
they
commenced
dancing
highland
reels
and
strathspeys
on
the
bank
of
the
river
for
joy
at
their
escape
whilst
a
number
of
wretched
girls
paramours
of
some
of
them
were
perishing
in
the
waters
of
the
swollen
river
in
an
attempt
to
follow
them
they
themselves
passed
over
by
eighties
and
by
hundreds
arm
in
arm
for
mutual
safety
without
the
loss
of
a
man
but
they
left
the
poor
paramours
to
shift
for
themselves
nor
did
any
of
these
canny
people
after
passing
the
stream
dash
back
to
rescue
a
single
female
life
no
they
were
too
well
employed
upon
the
bank
in
dancing
strathspeys
to
the
tune
of
charlie
the
water
it
was
indeed
charlie
the
water
and
canny
highlanders
the
water
but
where
were
the
poor
prostitutes
meantime
the
the
jacobite
farce
or
tragedy
was
speedily
brought
to
a
close
by
the
battle
of
culloden
there
did
charlie
wish
himself
back
again
the
water
exhibiting
the
most
unmistakable
signs
of
pusillanimity
there
were
the
clans
cut
to
pieces
at
least
those
who
could
be
brought
to
the
charge
and
there
fell
giles
mac
bean
or
as
he
was
called
in
gaelic
giliosa
mac
beathan
a
kind
of
giant
six
feet
four
inches
and
a
quarter
high
than
whom
as
his
wife
said
in
a
coronach
she
made
upon
him
no
man
who
stood
at
cuiloitr
was
taller
giles
mac
bean
the
major
of
the
clan
cattan
a
great
drinker
a
great
fisher
a
great
shooter
and
the
champion
of
the
highland
host
the
last
of
the
stuarts
was
a
cardinal
such
were
the
stuarts
such
their
miserable
history
they
were
dead
and
buried
in
every
sense
of
the
word
until
scott
resuscitated
them
how
by
the
power
of
fine
writing
and
by
calling
to
his
aid
that
strange
divinity
gentility
he
wrote
splendid
novels
about
the
stuarts
in
which
he
represents
them
as
unlike
what
they
really
were
as
the
graceful
and
beautiful
papillon
is
unlike
the
hideous
and
filthy
worm
in
a
word
he
made
them
genteel
and
that
was
enough
to
give
them
paramount
sway
over
the
minds
of
the
british
people
the
public
became
and
everybody
specially
the
women
said
what
a
pity
it
was
that
we
a
stuart
to
govern
all
parties
whig
tory
or
radical
became
jacobite
at
heart
and
admirers
of
absolute
power
the
whigs
talked
about
the
liberty
of
the
subject
and
the
radicals
about
the
rights
of
man
still
but
neither
party
cared
a
straw
for
what
it
talked
about
and
mentally
swore
that
as
soon
as
by
means
of
such
stuff
they
could
get
places
and
fill
their
pockets
they
would
be
as
jacobite
as
the
jacobs
themselves
as
for
tories
no
great
change
in
them
was
necessary
everything
favouring
absolutism
and
slavery
being
congenial
to
them
so
the
whole
nation
that
is
the
reading
part
of
the
nation
with
some
exceptions
for
thank
god
there
has
always
been
some
salt
in
england
went
over
the
water
to
charlie
but
going
over
to
charlie
was
not
enough
they
must
or
at
least
a
considerable
part
of
them
go
over
to
rome
too
or
have
a
hankering
to
do
so
as
the
priest
sarcastically
observes
in
the
text
as
all
the
jacobs
were
papists
so
the
good
folks
who
through
scott
novels
admire
the
jacobs
must
be
papists
too
an
idea
got
about
that
the
religion
of
such
genteel
people
as
the
stuarts
must
be
the
climax
of
gentility
and
that
idea
was
quite
sufficient
only
let
a
thing
whether
temporal
or
spiritual
be
considered
genteel
in
england
and
if
it
be
not
followed
it
is
strange
indeed
so
writings
not
only
made
the
greater
part
of
the
nation
jacobite
but
popish
here
some
people
will
exclaim
whose
opinions
remain
sound
and
uncontaminated
what
you
say
is
perhaps
true
with
respect
to
the
jacobite
nonsense
at
present
so
prevalent
being
derived
from
scott
novels
but
the
popish
nonsense
which
people
of
the
genteeler
classes
are
so
fond
of
is
derived
from
oxford
we
sent
our
sons
to
oxford
nice
honest
lads
educated
in
the
principles
of
the
church
of
england
and
at
the
end
of
the
first
term
they
came
home
puppies
talking
popish
nonsense
which
they
had
learned
from
the
pedants
to
whose
care
we
had
entrusted
them
ay
not
only
popery
but
jacobitism
which
they
hardly
carried
with
them
from
home
for
we
never
heard
them
talking
jacobitism
before
they
had
been
at
oxford
but
now
their
conversation
is
a
farrago
of
popish
and
jacobite
stuff
complines
and
claverse
now
what
these
honest
folks
say
is
to
a
certain
extent
founded
on
fact
the
popery
which
has
overflowed
the
land
during
the
last
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
has
come
immediately
from
oxford
and
likewise
some
of
the
jacobitism
popish
and
jacobite
nonsense
and
little
or
nothing
else
having
been
taught
at
oxford
for
about
that
number
of
years
but
whence
did
the
pedants
get
the
popish
nonsense
with
which
they
have
corrupted
youth
why
from
the
same
quarter
from
which
they
got
the
jacobite
nonsense
with
which
they
have
inoculated
those
lads
who
were
not
inoculated
with
it
before
novels
jacobitism
and
laudism
a
kind
of
half
popery
had
at
one
time
been
very
prevalent
at
oxford
but
both
had
been
long
consigned
to
oblivion
there
and
people
at
oxford
cared
as
little
about
laud
as
they
did
about
the
pretender
both
were
dead
and
buried
there
as
everywhere
else
till
scott
called
them
out
of
their
graves
when
the
pedants
of
oxford
hailed
both
ay
and
the
pope
too
as
soon
as
scott
had
made
the
old
fellow
fascinating
through
particular
novels
more
especially
the
monastery
and
abbot
then
the
quiet
respectable
honourable
church
of
england
would
no
longer
do
for
the
pedants
of
oxford
they
must
belong
to
a
more
genteel
church
they
were
ashamed
at
first
to
be
downright
romans
so
they
would
be
lauds
the
but
exceedingly
genteel
clergyman
in
waverley
was
a
laud
but
they
soon
became
tired
of
being
lauds
for
laud
church
and
idolatrous
as
it
was
was
not
sufficiently
tinselly
and
idolatrous
for
them
so
they
must
be
popes
but
in
a
sneaking
way
still
calling
themselves
men
in
order
to
batten
on
the
bounty
of
the
church
which
they
were
betraying
and
likewise
have
opportunities
of
corrupting
such
lads
as
might
still
resort
to
oxford
with
principles
uncontaminated
so
the
respectable
people
whose
opinions
are
still
sound
are
to
a
certain
extent
right
when
they
say
that
the
tide
of
popery
which
has
flowed
over
the
land
has
come
from
oxford
it
did
come
immediately
from
oxford
but
how
did
it
get
to
oxford
why
from
scott
novels
oh
that
sermon
which
was
the
first
manifestation
of
oxford
feeling
preached
at
oxford
some
time
in
the
year
by
a
divine
of
a
weak
and
confused
intellect
in
which
popery
was
mixed
up
with
jacobitism
the
present
writer
remembers
perfectly
well
on
reading
some
extracts
from
it
at
the
time
in
a
newspaper
on
the
top
of
a
coach
exclaiming
why
the
simpleton
has
been
pilfering
from
walter
scott
novels
o
oxford
pedants
oxford
pedants
ye
whose
politics
and
religion
are
both
derived
from
scott
novels
what
a
pity
it
is
that
some
lad
of
honest
parents
whose
mind
ye
are
endeavouring
to
stultify
with
your
nonsense
about
complines
and
claverse
has
not
the
spirit
to
start
up
and
cry
confound
your
gibberish
i
have
none
of
it
hurrah
for
the
church
and
the
principles
of
my
chapter
vii
same
subject
continued
now
what
could
have
induced
scott
to
write
novels
tending
to
make
people
papists
and
jacobites
and
in
love
with
arbitrary
power
did
he
think
that
christianity
was
a
gaudy
mummery
he
did
not
he
could
not
for
he
had
read
the
bible
yet
was
he
fond
of
gaudy
mummeries
fond
of
talking
about
them
did
he
believe
that
the
stuarts
were
a
good
family
and
fit
to
govern
a
country
like
britain
he
knew
that
they
were
a
vicious
worthless
crew
and
that
britain
was
a
degraded
country
as
long
as
they
swayed
the
sceptre
but
for
those
facts
he
cared
nothing
they
governed
in
a
way
which
he
liked
for
he
had
an
abstract
love
of
despotism
and
an
abhorrence
of
everything
savouring
of
freedom
and
the
rights
of
man
in
general
his
favourite
political
picture
was
a
joking
profligate
careless
king
nominally
absolute
the
heads
of
great
houses
paying
court
to
but
in
reality
governing
that
king
whilst
revelling
with
him
on
the
plunder
of
a
nation
and
a
set
of
crouching
grovelling
vassals
the
literal
meaning
of
vassal
is
a
wretch
who
after
allowing
themselves
to
be
horsewhipped
would
take
a
bone
if
flung
to
them
and
be
grateful
so
that
in
love
with
mummery
though
he
knew
what
christianity
was
no
wonder
he
admired
such
a
church
as
that
of
rome
and
that
which
laud
set
up
and
by
nature
formed
to
be
the
holder
of
the
candle
to
ancient
eaten
and
profligate
families
no
wonder
that
all
his
sympathies
were
with
the
stuarts
and
their
dissipated
insolent
party
and
all
his
hatred
directed
against
those
who
endeavoured
to
check
them
in
their
proceedings
and
to
raise
the
generality
of
mankind
something
above
a
state
of
vassalage
that
is
wretchedness
those
who
were
born
great
were
if
he
could
have
had
his
will
always
to
remain
great
however
worthless
their
characters
those
who
were
born
low
were
always
to
remain
so
however
great
their
talents
though
if
that
rule
were
carried
out
where
would
he
have
been
himself
in
the
book
which
he
called
the
history
of
napoleon
bonaparte
in
which
he
plays
the
sycophant
to
all
the
legitimate
crowned
heads
in
europe
whatever
their
crimes
vices
or
miserable
imbecilities
he
in
his
abhorrence
of
everything
low
which
by
its
own
vigour
makes
itself
illustrious
calls
murat
of
the
sabre
the
son
of
a
of
a
marseilleise
it
is
a
pity
that
people
who
give
themselves
airs
and
the
scotch
in
general
are
wonderfully
addicted
to
giving
themselves
airs
and
checking
people
better
than
themselves
with
their
birth
and
their
country
it
is
a
great
pity
that
such
people
do
not
look
at
of
a
of
a
marseilleise
well
and
what
was
scott
himself
why
son
of
a
pettifogger
of
an
edinburgh
pettifogger
oh
but
scott
was
descended
from
the
old
of
buccleuch
and
therefore
descended
from
old
was
he
well
had
he
nothing
to
boast
of
beyond
such
a
pedigree
he
would
have
lived
and
died
the
son
of
a
pettifogger
and
been
forgotten
and
deservedly
so
but
he
possessed
talents
and
by
his
talents
rose
like
murat
and
like
him
will
be
remembered
for
his
talents
alone
and
deservedly
so
yes
but
murat
was
still
the
son
of
a
cook
and
though
he
was
certainly
good
at
the
sabre
and
cut
his
way
to
a
throne
still
lord
what
fools
there
are
in
the
world
but
as
no
one
can
be
thought
anything
of
in
this
world
without
a
pedigree
the
writer
will
now
give
a
pedigree
for
murat
of
a
very
different
character
from
the
one
of
scott
but
such
a
one
as
the
proudest
he
might
not
disdain
to
claim
scott
was
descended
from
the
old
of
buccleuch
was
he
good
and
murat
was
descended
from
the
old
moors
of
spain
from
the
abencerages
sons
of
the
saddle
of
granada
the
name
murat
is
arabic
and
is
the
same
as
murad
le
desire
or
the
one
scott
in
his
genteel
life
of
bonaparte
says
that
when
murat
was
in
egypt
the
similarity
between
the
name
of
the
celebrated
mameluke
mourad
and
that
of
bonaparte
meilleur
sabreur
was
remarked
and
became
the
subject
of
jest
amongst
the
comrades
of
the
gallant
frenchman
but
the
writer
of
the
novel
of
bonaparte
did
not
know
that
the
names
were
one
and
the
same
now
which
was
the
best
pedigree
that
of
the
son
of
the
or
that
of
the
son
of
the
pettifogger
which
was
the
best
blood
let
us
observe
the
workings
of
the
two
bloods
he
who
had
the
blood
of
the
sons
of
the
saddle
in
him
became
the
wonderful
cavalier
of
the
most
wonderful
host
that
ever
went
forth
to
conquest
won
for
himself
a
crown
and
died
the
death
of
a
soldier
leaving
behind
him
a
son
only
inferior
to
himself
in
strength
in
prowess
and
in
horsemanship
the
descendant
of
the
became
a
poet
a
novel
writer
the
panegyrist
of
great
folk
and
genteel
people
became
insolvent
because
though
an
author
he
deemed
it
ungenteel
to
be
mixed
up
with
the
business
part
of
the
authorship
died
paralytic
and
because
he
could
no
longer
give
entertainments
to
great
folks
leaving
behind
him
amongst
other
children
who
were
never
heard
of
a
son
who
through
his
father
interest
had
become
in
a
genteel
cavalry
regiment
a
son
who
was
ashamed
of
his
father
because
his
father
was
an
author
a
son
who
paugh
why
ask
which
was
the
best
blood
so
owing
to
his
rage
for
gentility
scott
must
needs
become
the
apologist
of
the
stuarts
and
their
party
but
god
made
this
man
pay
dearly
for
taking
the
part
of
the
wicked
against
the
good
for
lauding
up
to
the
skies
the
miscreants
and
robbers
and
calumniating
the
noble
spirits
of
britain
the
salt
of
england
and
his
own
country
as
god
had
driven
the
stuarts
from
their
throne
and
their
followers
from
their
estates
making
them
vagabonds
and
beggars
on
the
face
of
the
earth
taking
from
them
all
that
they
cared
for
so
did
that
same
god
who
knows
perfectly
well
how
and
where
to
strike
deprive
the
apologist
of
that
wretched
crew
of
all
that
rendered
life
pleasant
in
his
eyes
the
lack
of
which
paralysed
him
in
body
and
mind
rendered
him
pitiable
to
others
loathsome
to
himself
so
much
so
that
he
once
said
where
is
the
beggar
who
would
change
places
with
me
notwithstanding
all
my
fame
ah
god
knows
perfectly
well
how
to
strike
he
permitted
him
to
retain
all
his
literary
fame
to
the
very
last
his
literary
fame
for
which
he
cared
nothing
but
what
became
of
the
sweetness
of
life
his
fine
house
his
grand
company
and
his
entertainments
the
grand
house
ceased
to
be
his
he
was
only
permitted
to
live
in
it
on
sufferance
and
whatever
grandeur
it
might
still
retain
it
soon
became
as
desolate
a
looking
house
as
any
misanthrope
could
wish
to
see
where
were
the
grand
entertainments
and
the
grand
company
there
are
no
grand
entertainments
where
there
is
no
money
no
lords
and
ladies
where
there
are
no
entertainments
and
there
lay
the
poor
lodger
in
the
desolate
house
groaning
on
a
bed
no
longer
his
smitten
by
the
hand
of
god
in
the
part
where
he
was
most
vulnerable
of
what
use
telling
such
a
man
to
take
comfort
for
he
had
written
the
minstrel
and
rob
roy
telling
him
to
think
of
his
literary
fame
literary
fame
indeed
he
wanted
back
his
lost
gentility
retain
my
altar
i
care
nothing
for
it
but
oh
touch
not
my
porny
of
the
he
dies
his
children
die
too
and
then
comes
the
crowning
judgment
of
god
on
what
remains
of
his
race
and
the
house
which
he
had
built
he
was
not
a
papist
himself
nor
did
he
wish
any
one
belonging
to
him
to
be
popish
for
he
had
read
enough
of
the
bible
to
know
that
no
one
can
be
saved
through
popery
yet
had
he
a
sneaking
affection
for
it
and
would
at
times
in
an
underhand
manner
give
it
a
good
word
both
in
writing
and
discourse
because
it
was
a
gaudy
kind
of
worship
and
ignorance
and
vassalage
prevailed
so
long
as
it
flourished
but
he
certainly
did
not
wish
any
of
his
people
to
become
papists
nor
the
house
which
he
had
built
to
become
a
popish
house
though
the
very
name
he
gave
it
savoured
of
popery
but
popery
becomes
fashionable
through
his
novels
and
poems
the
only
one
that
remains
of
his
race
a
female
grandchild
marries
a
person
who
following
the
fashion
becomes
a
papist
and
makes
her
a
papist
too
money
abounds
with
the
husband
who
buys
the
house
and
then
the
house
becomes
the
rankest
popish
house
in
britain
a
superstitious
person
might
almost
imagine
that
one
of
the
old
scottish
covenanters
whilst
the
grand
house
was
being
built
from
the
profits
resulting
from
the
sale
of
writings
favouring
popery
and
persecution
and
calumniatory
of
scotland
saints
and
martyrs
had
risen
from
the
grave
and
banned
scott
his
race
and
his
house
by
reading
a
certain
psalm
in
saying
what
he
has
said
about
scott
the
author
has
not
been
influenced
by
any
feeling
of
malice
or
but
simply
by
a
regard
for
truth
and
a
desire
to
point
out
to
his
countrymen
the
harm
which
has
resulted
from
the
perusal
of
his
works
he
is
not
one
of
those
who
would
depreciate
the
talents
of
scott
he
admires
his
talents
both
as
a
prose
writer
and
a
poet
as
a
poet
especially
he
admires
him
and
believes
him
to
have
been
by
far
the
greatest
with
perhaps
the
exception
of
mickiewicz
who
only
wrote
for
unfortunate
poland
that
europe
has
given
birth
to
during
the
last
hundred
years
as
a
prose
writer
he
admires
him
less
it
is
true
but
his
admiration
for
him
in
that
capacity
is
very
high
and
he
only
laments
that
he
prostituted
his
talents
to
the
cause
of
the
stuarts
and
gentility
what
book
of
fiction
of
the
present
century
can
you
read
twice
with
the
exception
of
waverley
and
rob
roy
there
is
pelham
it
is
true
which
the
writer
of
these
lines
has
seen
a
jewess
reading
in
the
steppe
of
debreczin
and
which
a
young
prussian
baron
a
great
traveller
whom
he
met
at
constantinople
in
told
him
he
always
carried
in
his
valise
and
in
conclusion
he
will
say
in
order
to
show
the
opinion
which
he
entertains
of
the
power
of
scott
as
a
writer
that
he
did
for
the
sceptre
of
the
wretched
pretender
what
all
the
kings
of
europe
could
not
do
for
his
body
placed
it
on
the
throne
of
these
realms
and
for
popery
what
popes
and
cardinals
strove
in
vain
to
do
for
three
centuries
brought
back
its
mummeries
and
nonsense
into
the
temples
of
the
british
isles
scott
during
his
lifetime
had
a
crowd
of
imitators
who
whether
they
wrote
history
so
called
poetry
so
called
or
novels
nobody
would
call
a
book
a
novel
if
he
could
call
it
anything
else
wrote
charlie
the
water
nonsense
and
now
that
he
has
been
dead
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
there
are
others
daily
springing
up
who
are
striving
to
imitate
scott
in
his
charlie
the
water
nonsense
for
nonsense
it
is
even
when
flowing
from
his
pen
they
too
must
write
jacobite
histories
jacobite
songs
and
jacobite
novels
and
much
the
same
figure
as
the
scoundrel
menials
in
the
comedy
cut
when
personating
their
masters
and
retailing
their
masters
conversation
do
they
cut
as
walter
scotts
in
their
histories
they
too
talk
about
the
prince
and
glenfinnan
and
the
pibroch
and
in
their
songs
about
claverse
and
bonny
dundee
but
though
they
may
be
scots
they
are
not
walter
scotts
but
it
is
perhaps
chiefly
in
the
novel
that
you
see
the
veritable
hog
in
armour
the
time
of
the
novel
is
of
course
the
or
the
hero
a
jacobite
and
connected
with
one
or
other
of
the
enterprises
of
those
periods
and
the
author
to
show
how
unprejudiced
he
is
and
what
views
he
takes
of
subjects
must
needs
speak
up
for
popery
whenever
he
has
occasion
to
mention
it
though
with
all
his
originality
when
he
brings
his
hero
and
the
vagabonds
with
which
he
is
concerned
before
a
barricadoed
house
belonging
to
the
whigs
he
can
make
them
get
into
it
by
no
other
method
than
that
which
scott
makes
his
rioters
employ
to
get
into
the
tolbooth
the
door
to
express
the
more
than
utter
foolishness
of
this
latter
charlie
the
water
nonsense
whether
in
rhyme
or
prose
there
is
but
one
word
and
that
word
a
scotch
word
scotch
the
sorriest
of
jargons
compared
with
which
even
roth
welsch
is
dignified
and
expressive
has
yet
one
word
to
express
what
would
be
inexpressible
by
any
word
or
combination
of
words
in
any
language
or
in
any
other
jargon
in
the
world
and
very
properly
for
as
the
nonsense
is
properly
scotch
so
should
the
word
be
scotch
which
expresses
it
that
word
is
fushionless
pronounced
and
when
the
writer
has
called
the
nonsense
fooshionless
and
he
does
call
it
fooshionless
he
has
nothing
more
to
say
but
leaves
the
nonsense
to
its
fate
chapter
viii
on
canting
nonsense
the
writer
now
wishes
to
say
something
on
the
subject
of
canting
nonsense
of
which
there
is
a
great
deal
in
england
there
are
various
cants
in
england
amongst
which
is
the
religious
cant
he
is
not
going
to
discuss
the
subject
of
religious
cant
lest
however
he
should
be
misunderstood
he
begs
leave
to
repeat
that
he
is
a
sincere
member
of
the
church
of
england
in
which
he
believes
there
is
more
religion
and
consequently
less
cant
than
in
any
other
church
in
the
world
nor
is
he
going
to
discuss
many
other
cants
he
shall
content
himself
with
saying
something
about
two
the
temperance
cant
and
the
unmanly
cant
temperance
canters
say
that
it
is
unlawful
to
drink
a
glass
of
ale
unmanly
canters
say
that
it
is
unlawful
to
use
one
fists
the
writer
begs
leave
to
tell
both
these
species
of
canters
that
they
do
not
speak
words
of
truth
it
is
very
lawful
to
take
a
cup
of
ale
or
wine
for
the
purpose
of
cheering
or
invigorating
yourself
when
you
are
faint
and
and
likewise
to
give
a
cup
of
ale
or
wine
to
others
when
they
are
in
a
similar
condition
the
holy
scripture
sayeth
nothing
to
the
contrary
but
rather
encourageth
people
in
so
doing
by
the
text
wine
maketh
glad
the
heart
of
man
but
it
is
not
lawful
to
intoxicate
yourself
with
frequent
cups
of
ale
or
wine
nor
to
make
others
intoxicated
nor
does
the
holy
scripture
say
it
is
the
holy
scripture
no
more
says
that
it
is
lawful
to
intoxicate
yourself
or
others
than
it
says
that
it
is
unlawful
to
take
a
cup
of
ale
or
wine
yourself
or
to
give
one
to
others
noah
is
not
commended
in
the
scripture
for
making
himself
drunken
on
the
wine
he
brewed
nor
is
it
said
that
the
saviour
when
he
supplied
the
guests
with
wine
at
the
told
them
to
make
themselves
drunk
upon
it
he
is
said
to
have
supplied
them
with
wine
but
he
doubtless
left
the
quantity
which
each
should
drink
to
each
party
reason
and
discretion
when
you
set
a
good
dinner
before
your
guests
you
do
not
expect
that
they
should
gorge
themselves
with
the
victuals
you
set
before
them
wine
may
be
abused
and
so
may
a
leg
of
mutton
second
it
is
lawful
for
any
one
to
use
his
fists
in
his
own
defence
or
in
the
defence
of
others
provided
they
ca
help
themselves
but
it
is
not
lawful
to
use
them
for
purposes
of
tyranny
or
brutality
if
you
are
attacked
by
a
ruffian
as
the
elderly
individual
in
lavengro
is
in
the
it
is
quite
lawful
if
you
can
to
give
him
as
good
a
thrashing
as
the
elderly
individual
gave
the
brutal
coachman
and
if
you
see
a
helpless
woman
perhaps
your
own
sister
set
upon
by
a
drunken
lord
a
drunken
coachman
or
a
drunken
coalheaver
or
a
brute
of
any
description
either
drunk
or
sober
it
is
not
only
lawful
but
laudable
to
give
them
if
you
can
a
good
drubbing
but
it
is
not
lawful
because
you
have
a
strong
pair
of
fists
and
know
how
to
use
them
to
go
swaggering
through
a
fair
jostling
against
unoffending
individuals
should
you
do
so
you
would
be
served
quite
right
if
you
were
to
get
a
drubbing
more
particularly
if
you
were
served
out
by
some
one
less
strong
but
more
skilful
than
yourself
even
as
the
coachman
was
served
out
by
a
pupil
of
the
immortal
broughton
sixty
years
old
it
is
true
but
possessed
of
broughton
guard
and
chop
moses
is
not
blamed
in
the
scripture
for
taking
part
with
the
oppressed
and
killing
an
egyptian
persecutor
we
are
not
told
how
moses
killed
the
egyptian
but
it
is
quite
as
creditable
to
moses
to
suppose
that
he
killed
the
egyptian
by
giving
him
a
buffet
under
the
left
ear
as
by
stabbing
him
with
a
knife
it
is
true
that
the
saviour
in
the
new
testament
tells
his
disciples
to
turn
the
left
cheek
to
be
smitten
after
they
had
received
a
blow
on
the
right
but
he
was
speaking
to
people
divinely
inspired
or
whom
he
intended
divinely
to
inspire
people
selected
by
god
for
a
particular
purpose
he
likewise
tells
these
people
to
part
with
various
articles
of
raiment
when
asked
for
them
and
to
go
without
money
and
take
no
thought
of
the
morrow
are
those
exhortations
carried
out
by
very
good
people
in
the
present
day
do
quakers
when
smitten
on
the
right
cheek
turn
the
left
to
the
smiter
when
asked
for
their
coat
do
they
say
friend
take
my
shirt
also
has
the
dean
of
salisbury
no
purse
does
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
go
to
an
inn
run
up
a
reckoning
and
then
say
to
his
landlady
mistress
i
have
no
coin
assuredly
the
dean
has
a
purse
and
a
tolerably
one
and
assuredly
the
archbishop
on
departing
from
an
inn
not
only
settles
his
reckoning
but
leaves
something
handsome
for
the
servants
and
does
not
say
that
he
is
forbidden
by
the
gospel
to
pay
for
what
he
has
eaten
or
the
trouble
he
has
given
as
a
certain
spanish
cavalier
said
he
was
forbidden
by
the
statutes
of
chivalry
now
to
take
the
part
of
yourself
or
the
part
of
the
oppressed
with
your
fists
is
quite
as
lawful
in
the
present
day
as
it
is
to
refuse
your
coat
and
shirt
also
to
any
vagabond
who
may
ask
for
them
and
not
to
refuse
to
pay
for
supper
bed
and
breakfast
at
the
feathers
or
any
other
inn
after
you
have
had
the
benefit
of
all
three
the
conduct
of
lavengro
with
respect
to
drink
may
upon
the
whole
serve
as
a
model
he
is
no
drunkard
nor
is
he
fond
of
intoxicating
other
people
yet
when
the
horrors
are
upon
him
he
has
no
objection
to
go
to
a
and
call
for
a
pint
of
ale
nor
does
he
shrink
from
recommending
ale
to
others
when
they
are
faint
and
downcast
in
one
instance
it
is
true
he
does
what
can
not
be
exactly
justified
he
encourages
the
priest
in
the
dingle
in
more
instances
than
one
in
drinking
more
hollands
and
water
than
is
consistent
with
decorum
he
has
a
motive
indeed
in
doing
so
a
desire
to
learn
from
the
knave
in
his
cups
the
plans
and
hopes
of
the
propaganda
of
rome
such
conduct
however
was
inconsistent
with
strict
fair
dealing
and
openness
and
the
author
advises
all
those
whose
consciences
never
reproach
them
for
a
single
unfair
or
covert
act
committed
by
them
to
abuse
him
heartily
for
administering
hollands
and
water
to
the
priest
of
rome
in
that
instance
the
hero
is
certainly
wrong
yet
in
all
other
cases
with
regard
to
drink
he
is
manifestly
right
to
tell
people
that
they
are
never
to
drink
a
glass
of
ale
or
wine
themselves
or
to
give
one
to
others
is
cant
and
the
writer
has
no
toleration
for
cant
of
any
description
some
cants
are
not
dangerous
but
the
writer
believes
that
a
more
dangerous
cant
than
the
temperance
cant
or
as
it
is
generally
called
teetotalism
is
scarcely
to
be
found
the
writer
is
willing
to
believe
that
it
originated
with
well
meaning
though
weak
people
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
quickly
turned
to
account
by
people
who
were
neither
well
meaning
nor
weak
let
the
reader
note
particularly
the
purpose
to
which
this
cry
has
been
turned
in
america
the
land
indeed
par
excellence
of
humbug
and
humbug
cries
it
is
there
continually
in
the
mouth
of
the
most
violent
political
party
and
is
made
an
instrument
of
almost
unexampled
persecution
the
writer
would
say
more
on
the
temperance
cant
both
in
england
and
america
but
want
of
space
prevents
him
there
is
one
point
on
which
he
can
not
avoid
making
a
few
brief
remarks
that
is
the
inconsistent
conduct
of
its
apostles
in
general
the
teetotal
apostle
says
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
be
drunk
so
it
is
teetotaller
but
if
so
why
do
you
get
drunk
i
get
drunk
yes
unhappy
man
why
do
you
get
drunk
on
smoke
and
passion
why
are
your
garments
impregnated
with
the
odour
of
the
indian
weed
why
is
there
a
pipe
or
a
cigar
always
in
your
mouth
why
is
your
language
more
dreadful
than
that
of
a
poissarde
is
more
deleterious
than
ale
teetotaller
bile
more
potent
than
brandy
you
are
fond
of
telling
your
hearers
what
an
awful
thing
it
is
to
die
drunken
so
it
is
teetotaller
then
take
good
care
that
you
do
not
die
with
smoke
and
passion
drunken
and
with
temperance
language
on
your
lips
that
is
abuse
and
calumny
against
all
those
who
differ
from
you
one
word
of
sense
you
have
been
heard
to
say
which
is
that
spirits
may
be
taken
as
a
medicine
now
you
are
in
a
fever
of
passion
teetotaller
so
pray
take
this
tumbler
of
brandy
take
it
on
the
homoeopathic
principle
that
heat
is
to
be
expelled
by
heat
you
are
in
a
temperance
fury
so
swallow
the
contents
of
this
tumbler
and
it
will
perhaps
cure
you
you
look
at
the
glass
wistfully
you
occasionally
take
a
glass
medicinally
and
it
is
probable
you
do
take
one
now
consider
what
a
dreadful
thing
it
would
be
to
die
passion
drunk
to
appear
before
your
maker
with
intemperate
language
on
your
lips
that
right
you
do
seem
to
wince
at
the
brandy
right
well
done
all
down
in
two
pulls
now
you
look
like
a
reasonable
being
if
the
conduct
of
lavengro
with
regard
to
drink
is
open
to
little
censure
assuredly
the
use
which
he
makes
of
his
fists
is
entitled
to
none
at
all
because
he
has
a
pair
of
tolerably
strong
fists
and
knows
to
a
certain
extent
how
to
use
them
is
he
a
swaggerer
or
oppressor
to
what
ill
account
does
he
turn
them
who
more
quiet
gentle
and
inoffensive
than
he
he
beats
off
a
ruffian
who
attacks
him
in
a
dingle
has
a
kind
of
friendly
tuzzle
with
petulengro
and
behold
the
extent
of
his
fistic
exploits
ay
but
he
associates
with
and
that
very
fellow
petulengro
is
a
and
has
fought
for
a
stake
in
a
ring
well
and
if
he
had
not
associated
with
how
could
he
have
used
his
fists
oh
anybody
can
use
his
fists
in
his
own
defence
without
being
taught
by
can
they
then
why
does
not
the
italian
or
spaniard
or
affghan
use
his
fists
when
insulted
or
outraged
instead
of
having
recourse
to
the
weapons
which
he
has
recourse
to
nobody
can
use
his
fists
without
being
taught
the
use
of
them
by
those
who
have
themselves
been
taught
no
more
than
any
one
can
whiffle
without
being
taught
by
a
master
of
the
art
now
let
any
man
of
the
present
day
try
to
whiffle
would
not
any
one
who
wished
to
whiffle
have
to
go
to
a
master
of
the
art
assuredly
but
where
would
he
find
one
at
the
present
day
the
last
of
the
whifflers
hanged
himself
about
a
fortnight
ago
on
a
in
a
church
steeple
of
the
old
town
from
pure
grief
that
there
was
no
further
demand
for
the
exhibition
of
his
art
there
being
no
demand
for
whiffling
since
the
discontinuation
of
guildhall
banquets
whiffling
is
lost
the
old
chap
left
his
sword
behind
him
let
any
one
take
up
the
old
chap
sword
and
try
to
whiffle
now
much
the
same
hand
as
he
would
make
who
should
take
up
the
sword
and
try
to
whiffle
would
he
who
should
try
to
use
his
fists
who
had
never
had
the
advantage
of
a
master
let
no
one
think
that
men
use
their
fists
naturally
in
their
own
disputes
men
have
naturally
recourse
to
any
other
thing
to
defend
themselves
or
to
offend
others
they
fly
to
the
stick
to
the
stone
to
the
murderous
and
cowardly
knife
or
to
abuse
as
cowardly
as
the
knife
and
occasionally
more
murderous
now
which
is
best
when
you
hate
a
person
or
have
a
pique
against
a
person
to
clench
your
fist
and
say
come
on
or
to
have
recourse
to
the
stone
the
knife
or
murderous
calumny
the
use
of
the
fist
is
almost
lost
in
england
yet
are
the
people
better
than
they
were
when
they
knew
how
to
use
their
fists
the
writer
believes
not
a
fisty
combat
is
at
present
a
great
rarity
but
the
use
of
the
knife
the
noose
and
of
poison
to
say
nothing
of
calumny
are
of
more
frequent
occurrence
in
england
than
perhaps
in
any
country
in
europe
is
polite
taste
better
than
when
it
could
bear
the
details
of
a
fight
the
writer
believes
not
two
men
can
not
meet
in
a
ring
to
settle
a
dispute
in
a
manly
manner
without
some
trumpery
local
newspaper
letting
loose
a
volley
of
abuse
against
the
disgraceful
exhibition
in
which
abuse
it
is
sure
to
be
sanctioned
by
its
dainty
readers
whereas
some
murderous
horror
the
discovery
for
example
of
the
mangled
remains
of
a
woman
in
some
obscure
den
is
greedily
seized
hold
of
by
the
moral
journal
and
dressed
up
for
its
readers
who
luxuriate
and
gloat
upon
the
ghastly
dish
now
the
writer
of
lavengro
has
no
sympathy
with
those
who
would
shrink
from
striking
a
blow
but
would
not
shrink
from
the
use
of
poison
or
calumny
and
his
taste
has
little
in
common
with
that
which
can
not
tolerate
the
hardy
details
of
a
but
which
luxuriates
on
descriptions
of
the
murder
dens
of
modern
england
but
and
pugilists
are
blackguards
a
reviewer
has
said
and
blackguards
they
would
be
provided
they
employed
their
skill
and
their
prowess
for
purposes
of
brutality
and
oppression
but
and
pugilists
are
seldom
friends
to
brutality
and
oppression
and
which
is
the
blackguard
the
writer
would
ask
he
who
uses
his
fists
to
take
his
own
part
or
instructs
others
to
use
theirs
for
the
same
purpose
or
the
being
who
from
envy
and
malice
or
at
the
bidding
of
a
malicious
scoundrel
endeavours
by
calumny
falsehood
and
misrepresentation
to
impede
the
efforts
of
lonely
and
unprotected
genius
one
word
more
about
the
race
all
but
extinct
of
the
people
opprobriously
called
some
of
them
have
been
as
noble
kindly
men
as
the
world
ever
produced
can
the
rolls
of
the
english
aristocracy
exhibit
names
belonging
to
more
noble
more
heroic
men
than
those
who
were
called
respectively
pearce
cribb
and
spring
did
ever
one
of
the
english
aristocracy
contract
the
seeds
of
fatal
consumption
by
rushing
up
the
stairs
of
a
burning
edifice
even
to
the
topmost
garret
and
rescuing
a
woman
from
seemingly
inevitable
destruction
the
writer
says
no
a
woman
was
rescued
from
the
top
of
a
burning
house
but
the
man
who
rescued
her
was
no
aristocrat
it
was
pearce
not
percy
who
ran
up
the
burning
stairs
did
ever
one
of
those
glittering
ones
save
a
fainting
female
from
the
libidinous
rage
of
six
ruffians
the
writer
believes
not
a
woman
was
rescued
from
the
libidinous
fury
of
six
monsters
on
down
but
the
man
who
rescued
her
was
no
aristocrat
it
was
pearce
not
paulet
who
rescued
the
woman
and
thrashed
my
lord
six
gamekeepers
pearce
whose
equal
never
was
and
probably
never
will
be
found
in
sturdy
combat
are
there
any
of
the
aristocracy
of
whom
it
can
be
said
that
they
never
did
a
cowardly
cruel
or
mean
action
and
that
they
invariably
took
the
part
of
the
unfortunate
and
weak
against
cruelty
and
oppression
as
much
can
be
said
of
cribb
of
spring
and
the
other
but
where
is
the
aristocrat
of
whom
as
much
can
be
said
wellington
wellington
indeed
a
skilful
general
and
a
good
man
of
valour
it
is
true
but
with
that
cant
word
of
duty
continually
on
his
lips
did
he
rescue
ney
from
his
butchers
did
he
lend
a
helping
hand
to
warner
in
conclusion
the
writer
would
advise
those
of
his
who
read
his
book
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
two
kinds
of
canting
nonsense
described
above
but
in
their
progress
through
life
to
enjoy
as
well
as
they
can
but
always
with
moderation
the
good
things
of
this
world
to
put
confidence
in
god
to
be
as
independent
as
possible
and
to
take
their
own
parts
if
they
are
let
them
not
make
themselves
foolish
by
putting
on
sackcloth
drinking
water
or
chewing
ashes
but
let
them
take
wholesome
exercise
and
eat
the
most
generous
food
they
can
get
taking
up
and
reading
occasionally
not
the
lives
of
ignatius
loyola
and
francis
spira
but
something
more
agreeable
for
example
the
life
and
adventures
of
duncan
campbell
the
deaf
and
dumb
gentleman
the
travels
of
captain
falconer
in
america
and
the
journal
of
john
randall
who
went
to
virginia
and
married
an
indian
wife
not
forgetting
amidst
their
eating
and
drinking
their
walks
over
heaths
and
by
the
and
their
agreeable
literature
to
be
charitable
to
the
poor
to
read
the
psalms
and
to
go
to
church
twice
on
a
sunday
in
their
dealings
with
people
to
be
courteous
to
everybody
as
lavengro
was
but
always
independent
like
him
and
if
people
meddle
with
them
to
give
them
as
good
as
they
bring
even
as
he
and
isopel
berners
were
in
the
habit
of
doing
and
it
will
be
as
well
for
him
to
observe
that
he
by
no
means
advises
women
to
be
too
womanly
but
bearing
the
conduct
of
isopel
berners
in
mind
to
take
their
own
parts
and
if
anybody
strikes
them
to
strike
again
beating
of
women
by
the
lords
of
the
creation
has
become
very
prevalent
in
england
since
pugilism
has
been
discountenanced
now
the
writer
strongly
advises
any
woman
who
is
struck
by
a
ruffian
to
strike
him
again
or
if
she
can
not
clench
her
fists
and
he
advises
all
women
in
these
singular
times
to
learn
to
clench
their
fists
to
go
at
him
with
tooth
and
nail
and
not
to
be
afraid
of
the
result
for
any
fellow
who
is
dastard
enough
to
strike
a
woman
would
allow
himself
to
be
beaten
by
a
woman
were
she
to
make
at
him
in
even
if
instead
of
possessing
the
stately
height
and
athletic
proportions
of
the
aforesaid
isopel
she
were
as
diminutive
in
stature
and
had
a
hand
as
delicate
and
foot
as
small
as
a
certain
royal
lady
who
was
some
time
ago
assaulted
by
a
fellow
upwards
of
six
feet
high
whom
the
writer
has
no
doubt
she
could
have
beaten
had
she
thought
proper
to
go
at
him
such
is
the
deliberate
advice
of
the
author
to
his
countrymen
and
women
advice
in
which
he
believes
there
is
nothing
unscriptural
or
repugnant
to
common
sense
the
writer
is
perfectly
well
aware
that
by
the
plain
language
which
he
has
used
in
speaking
of
the
various
kinds
of
nonsense
prevalent
in
england
he
shall
make
himself
a
multitude
of
enemies
but
he
is
not
going
to
conceal
the
truth
or
to
tamper
with
nonsense
from
the
fear
of
provoking
hostility
he
has
a
duty
to
perform
and
he
will
perform
it
resolutely
he
is
the
person
who
carried
the
bible
to
spain
and
as
resolutely
as
he
spoke
in
spain
against
the
superstitions
of
spain
will
he
speak
in
england
against
the
nonsense
of
his
own
native
land
he
is
not
one
of
those
who
before
they
sit
down
to
write
a
book
say
to
themselves
what
cry
shall
we
take
up
what
principles
shall
we
advocate
what
principles
shall
we
abuse
before
we
put
pen
to
paper
we
must
find
out
what
cry
is
the
loudest
what
principle
has
the
most
advocates
otherwise
after
having
written
our
book
we
may
find
ourselves
on
the
weaker
side
a
sailor
of
the
bounty
waked
from
his
sleep
by
the
noise
of
the
mutiny
lay
still
in
his
hammock
for
some
time
quite
undecided
whether
to
take
part
with
the
captain
or
to
join
the
mutineers
i
must
mind
what
i
do
said
he
to
himself
lest
in
the
end
i
find
myself
on
the
weaker
side
finally
on
hearing
that
the
mutineers
were
successful
he
went
on
deck
and
seeing
bligh
pinioned
to
the
mast
he
put
his
fist
to
his
nose
and
otherwise
insulted
him
now
there
are
many
writers
of
the
present
day
whose
conduct
is
very
similar
to
that
of
the
sailor
they
lie
listening
in
their
corners
till
they
have
ascertained
which
principle
has
most
advocates
then
presently
they
make
their
appearance
on
the
deck
of
the
world
with
their
book
if
truth
has
been
victorious
then
has
truth
the
hurrah
but
if
truth
is
pinioned
against
the
mast
then
is
their
fist
thrust
against
the
nose
of
truth
and
their
gibe
and
their
insult
spirted
in
her
face
the
strongest
party
had
the
sailor
and
the
strongest
party
has
almost
invariably
the
writer
of
the
present
day
chapter
ix
a
certain
set
of
individuals
calling
themselves
critics
have
attacked
lavengro
with
much
virulence
and
malice
if
what
they
call
criticism
had
been
founded
on
truth
the
author
would
have
had
nothing
to
say
the
book
contains
plenty
of
blemishes
some
of
them
by
the
bye
wilful
ones
as
the
writer
will
presently
show
not
one
of
these
however
has
been
detected
and
pointed
out
but
the
best
passages
in
the
book
indeed
whatever
was
calculated
to
make
the
book
valuable
have
been
assailed
with
abuse
and
misrepresentation
the
duty
of
the
true
critic
is
to
play
the
part
of
a
leech
and
not
of
a
viper
upon
true
and
upon
malignant
criticism
there
is
an
excellent
fable
by
the
spaniard
iriarte
the
viper
says
to
the
leech
why
do
people
invite
your
bite
and
flee
from
mine
because
says
the
leech
people
receive
health
from
my
bite
and
poison
from
yours
there
is
as
much
difference
says
the
clever
spaniard
between
true
and
malignant
criticism
as
between
poison
and
medicine
certainly
a
great
many
meritorious
writers
have
allowed
themselves
to
be
poisoned
by
malignant
criticism
the
writer
however
is
not
one
of
those
who
allow
themselves
to
be
poisoned
by
no
no
he
will
rather
hold
them
up
by
their
tails
and
show
the
creatures
wriggling
blood
and
foam
streaming
from
their
broken
jaws
first
of
all
however
he
will
notice
one
of
their
objections
the
book
is
true
say
they
now
one
of
the
principal
reasons
with
those
that
have
attacked
lavengro
for
their
abuse
of
it
is
that
it
is
particularly
true
in
one
instance
namely
that
it
exposes
their
own
nonsense
their
love
of
humbug
their
slavishness
their
dressings
their
goings
out
their
scraping
and
bowing
to
great
people
it
is
the
showing
up
of
in
lavengro
that
has
been
one
principal
reason
for
raising
the
above
cry
for
in
lavengro
is
denounced
the
besetting
folly
of
the
english
people
a
folly
which
those
who
call
themselves
guardians
of
the
public
taste
are
far
from
being
above
we
ca
abide
anything
that
is
true
they
exclaim
ca
they
then
why
are
they
so
enraptured
with
any
fiction
that
is
adapted
to
purposes
of
humbug
which
tends
to
make
them
satisfied
with
their
own
proceedings
with
their
own
nonsense
which
does
not
tell
them
to
reform
to
become
more
alive
to
their
own
failings
and
less
sensitive
about
the
tyrannical
goings
on
of
the
masters
and
the
degraded
condition
the
sufferings
and
the
trials
of
the
serfs
in
the
star
jupiter
had
lavengro
instead
of
being
the
work
of
an
independent
mind
been
written
in
order
to
further
any
of
the
thousand
and
one
cants
and
species
of
nonsense
prevalent
in
england
the
author
would
have
heard
much
less
about
its
not
being
true
both
from
public
detractors
and
private
censurers
but
lavengro
pretends
to
be
an
autobiography
say
the
critics
and
here
the
writer
begs
leave
to
observe
that
it
would
be
well
for
people
who
profess
to
have
a
regard
for
truth
not
to
exhibit
in
every
assertion
which
they
make
a
most
profligate
disregard
of
it
this
assertion
of
theirs
is
a
falsehood
and
they
know
it
to
be
a
falsehood
in
the
preface
lavengro
is
stated
to
be
a
dream
and
the
writer
takes
this
opportunity
of
stating
that
he
never
said
it
was
an
autobiography
never
authorized
any
person
to
say
that
it
was
one
and
that
he
has
in
innumerable
instances
declared
in
public
and
private
both
before
and
after
the
work
was
published
that
it
was
not
what
is
generally
termed
an
autobiography
but
a
set
of
people
who
pretend
to
write
criticisms
on
books
hating
the
author
for
various
reasons
amongst
others
because
having
the
proper
pride
of
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
he
did
not
in
the
year
choose
to
permit
himself
to
be
exhibited
and
made
a
zany
of
in
london
and
especially
because
he
will
neither
associate
with
nor
curry
favour
with
them
who
are
neither
gentlemen
nor
scholars
attack
his
book
with
abuse
and
calumny
he
is
perhaps
condescending
too
much
when
he
takes
any
notice
of
such
people
as
however
the
english
public
is
wonderfully
led
by
cries
and
shouts
and
generally
ready
to
take
part
against
any
person
who
is
either
unwilling
or
unable
to
defend
himself
he
deems
it
advisable
not
to
be
altogether
quiet
with
those
who
assail
him
the
best
way
to
deal
with
vipers
is
to
tear
out
their
teeth
and
the
best
way
to
deal
with
is
to
deprive
them
of
their
which
is
easily
done
by
exposing
their
ignorance
the
writer
knew
perfectly
well
the
description
of
people
with
whom
he
would
have
to
do
he
therefore
very
quietly
prepared
a
stratagem
by
means
of
which
he
could
at
any
time
exhibit
them
powerless
and
helpless
in
his
hand
critics
when
they
review
books
ought
to
have
a
competent
knowledge
of
the
subjects
which
those
books
discuss
lavengro
is
a
philological
book
a
poem
if
you
choose
to
call
it
so
now
what
a
fine
triumph
it
would
have
been
for
those
who
wished
to
vilify
the
book
and
its
author
provided
they
could
have
detected
the
latter
tripping
in
his
philology
they
might
have
instantly
said
that
he
was
an
ignorant
pretender
to
philology
they
laughed
at
the
idea
of
his
taking
up
a
viper
by
its
tail
a
trick
which
hundreds
of
country
urchins
do
every
september
but
they
were
silent
about
the
really
wonderful
part
of
the
book
the
philological
matter
they
thought
philology
was
his
stronghold
and
that
it
would
be
useless
to
attack
him
there
they
of
course
would
give
him
no
credit
as
a
philologist
for
anything
like
fair
treatment
towards
him
was
not
to
be
expected
at
their
hands
but
they
were
afraid
to
attack
his
philology
yet
that
was
the
point
and
the
only
point
in
which
they
might
have
attacked
him
successfully
he
was
vulnerable
there
how
was
this
why
in
order
to
have
an
opportunity
of
holding
up
by
the
tails
he
wilfully
spelt
various
foreign
words
wrong
welsh
words
and
even
italian
words
did
they
detect
these
misspellings
not
one
of
them
even
as
he
knew
they
would
not
and
he
now
taunts
them
with
ignorance
and
the
power
of
taunting
them
with
ignorance
is
the
punishment
which
he
designed
for
them
a
power
which
they
might
but
for
their
ignorance
have
used
against
him
the
writer
besides
knowing
something
of
italian
and
welsh
knows
a
little
of
armenian
language
and
literature
but
who
knowing
anything
of
the
armenian
language
unless
he
had
an
end
in
view
would
say
that
the
word
sea
in
armenian
is
anything
like
the
word
tide
in
english
the
word
for
sea
in
armenian
is
dzow
a
word
connected
with
the
tebetian
word
for
water
and
the
chinese
shuy
and
the
turkish
su
signifying
the
same
thing
but
where
is
the
resemblance
between
dzow
and
tide
again
the
word
for
bread
in
ancient
armenian
is
hats
yet
the
armenian
on
london
bridge
is
made
to
say
zhats
which
is
not
the
nominative
of
the
armenian
noun
for
bread
but
the
accusative
now
critics
ravening
against
a
man
because
he
is
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
and
has
not
only
the
power
but
also
the
courage
to
write
original
works
why
did
you
not
discover
that
weak
point
why
because
you
were
ignorant
so
here
ye
are
held
up
moreover
who
with
a
name
commencing
with
z
ever
wrote
fables
in
armenian
there
are
two
writers
of
fables
in
armenian
varthan
and
koscht
and
illustrious
writers
they
are
one
in
the
simple
and
the
other
in
the
ornate
style
of
armenian
composition
but
neither
of
their
names
begins
with
a
oh
what
a
precious
opportunity
ye
lost
ye
ravening
crew
of
convicting
the
poor
friendless
boy
of
the
book
of
ignorance
or
misrepresentation
by
asking
who
with
a
name
beginning
with
z
ever
wrote
fables
in
armenian
but
ye
could
help
yourselves
ye
are
duncie
we
duncie
ay
duncie
so
here
ye
are
held
up
by
the
tails
blood
and
foam
streaming
from
your
jaws
the
writer
wishes
to
ask
here
what
do
you
think
of
all
this
messieurs
les
critiques
were
ye
ever
served
so
before
but
do
you
richly
deserve
it
have
you
been
for
years
past
bullying
and
insulting
everybody
whom
you
deemed
weak
and
currying
favour
with
everybody
whom
you
thought
strong
we
approve
of
this
we
disapprove
of
that
oh
this
will
never
do
these
are
fine
lines
the
lines
perhaps
some
horrid
sycophantic
rubbish
addressed
to
wellington
or
lord
to
have
your
ignorance
thus
exposed
to
be
shown
up
in
this
manner
and
by
whom
a
gypsy
ay
a
gypsy
was
the
very
right
person
to
do
it
but
is
it
not
galling
after
all
ah
but
do
understand
armenian
it
can
not
be
expected
that
should
understand
armenian
or
welsh
or
hey
what
this
the
mighty
not
understand
armenian
or
welsh
or
then
why
does
the
mighty
pretend
to
review
a
book
like
lavengro
from
the
arrogance
with
which
it
continually
delivers
itself
one
would
think
that
the
mighty
is
omniscient
that
it
understands
every
language
is
versed
in
every
literature
yet
the
mighty
does
not
even
know
the
word
for
bread
in
armenian
it
knows
bread
well
enough
by
name
in
england
and
frequently
bread
in
england
only
by
its
name
but
the
truth
is
that
the
mighty
with
all
its
pretension
is
in
general
a
very
sorry
creature
who
instead
of
saying
nous
disons
should
rather
say
nous
dis
porny
in
his
guerre
des
dieux
very
profanely
makes
the
three
in
one
say
je
faisons
now
lavengro
who
is
anything
but
profane
would
suggest
that
critics
especially
magazine
and
sunday
newspaper
critics
should
commence
with
nous
dis
as
the
first
word
would
be
significant
of
the
conceit
and
assumption
of
the
critic
and
the
second
of
the
extent
of
the
critic
information
the
says
its
say
but
when
fawning
sycophancy
or
vulgar
abuse
are
taken
from
that
say
what
remains
why
a
blank
a
void
like
ginnungagap
as
the
writer
of
his
own
accord
has
exposed
some
of
the
blemishes
of
his
book
a
task
which
a
competent
critic
ought
to
have
done
he
will
now
point
out
two
or
three
of
its
merits
which
any
critic
not
altogether
blinded
with
ignorance
might
have
done
or
not
replete
with
gall
and
envy
would
have
been
glad
to
do
the
book
has
the
merit
of
communicating
a
fact
connected
with
physiology
which
in
all
the
pages
of
the
multitude
of
books
was
never
previously
mentioned
the
mysterious
practice
of
touching
objects
to
baffle
the
evil
chance
the
miserable
detractor
will
of
course
instantly
begin
to
rave
about
such
a
habit
being
common
well
and
good
but
was
it
ever
before
described
in
print
or
all
connected
with
it
dissected
he
may
then
vociferate
something
about
johnson
having
touched
the
writer
cares
not
whether
johnson
who
by
the
bye
during
the
last
twenty
or
thirty
years
owing
to
people
having
become
ultra
tory
mad
from
reading
scott
novels
and
the
quarterly
review
has
been
a
mighty
favourite
especially
with
some
who
were
in
the
habit
of
calling
him
a
half
crazy
old
fool
touched
or
whether
he
did
or
not
but
he
asks
where
did
johnson
ever
describe
the
feelings
which
induced
him
to
perform
the
magic
touch
even
supposing
that
he
did
perform
it
again
the
history
gives
an
account
of
a
certain
book
called
the
sleeping
bard
the
most
remarkable
prose
work
of
the
most
difficult
language
but
one
of
modern
europe
a
book
for
a
notice
of
which
he
believes
one
might
turn
over
in
vain
the
pages
of
any
review
printed
in
england
or
indeed
so
here
are
two
facts
one
literary
and
the
other
physiological
for
which
any
candid
critic
was
bound
to
thank
the
author
even
as
in
romany
rye
there
is
a
fact
connected
with
iro
norman
myth
for
the
disclosing
of
which
any
person
who
pretends
to
have
a
regard
for
literature
is
bound
to
thank
him
namely
that
the
mysterious
finn
or
fingal
of
ossian
poems
is
one
and
the
same
person
as
the
sigurd
fofnisbane
of
the
edda
and
the
wilkina
and
the
siegfried
horn
of
the
lay
of
the
niebelungs
the
writer
might
here
conclude
and
he
believes
most
triumphantly
as
however
he
is
in
the
cue
for
writing
which
he
seldom
is
he
will
for
his
own
gratification
and
for
the
sake
of
others
dropping
metaphors
about
vipers
and
serpents
show
up
in
particular
two
or
three
sets
or
cliques
of
people
who
he
is
happy
to
say
have
been
particularly
virulent
against
him
and
his
work
for
nothing
indeed
could
have
given
him
greater
mortification
than
their
praise
in
the
first
place
he
wishes
to
dispose
of
certain
individuals
who
call
themselves
men
of
wit
and
fashion
about
town
who
he
is
told
have
abused
his
book
vaustly
their
own
word
these
people
paint
their
cheeks
wear
white
kid
gloves
and
dabble
in
literature
or
what
they
conceive
to
be
literature
for
abuse
from
such
people
the
writer
was
prepared
does
any
one
imagine
that
the
writer
was
not
well
aware
before
he
published
his
book
that
whenever
he
gave
it
to
the
world
he
should
be
attacked
by
every
literary
coxcomb
in
england
who
had
influence
enough
to
procure
the
insertion
of
a
scurrilous
article
in
a
magazine
or
newspaper
he
has
been
in
spain
and
has
seen
how
invariably
the
mule
attacks
the
horse
now
why
does
the
mule
attack
the
horse
why
because
the
latter
carries
about
with
him
that
which
the
envious
hermaphrodite
does
not
possess
they
consider
forsooth
that
his
book
is
low
but
he
is
not
going
to
waste
words
about
them
one
or
two
of
whom
he
is
told
have
written
very
duncie
books
about
spain
and
are
highly
enraged
with
him
because
certain
books
which
he
wrote
about
spain
were
not
considered
duncie
no
he
is
not
going
to
waste
words
upon
them
for
verily
he
dislikes
their
company
and
so
he
pass
them
by
and
proceed
to
others
the
scotch
charlie
the
water
people
have
been
very
loud
in
the
abuse
of
lavengro
this
again
might
be
expected
the
sarcasms
of
the
priest
about
the
charlie
the
water
nonsense
of
course
stung
them
oh
it
is
one
of
the
claims
which
lavengro
has
to
respect
that
it
is
the
first
if
not
the
only
work
in
which
that
nonsense
is
to
a
certain
extent
exposed
two
or
three
of
their
remarks
on
passages
of
lavengro
he
will
reproduce
and
laugh
at
of
course
your
charlie
the
water
people
are
genteel
exceedingly
and
can
not
abide
anything
low
gypsyism
they
think
is
particularly
low
and
the
use
of
gypsy
words
in
literature
beneath
its
gentility
so
they
object
to
gypsy
words
being
used
in
lavengro
where
gypsies
are
introduced
speaking
what
is
romany
forsooth
say
they
very
good
and
what
is
scotch
has
not
the
public
been
nauseated
with
scotch
for
the
last
thirty
years
ay
but
scotch
is
not
the
writer
believes
he
knows
much
better
than
the
scotch
what
scotch
is
and
what
it
is
not
he
has
told
them
before
what
it
is
a
very
sorry
jargon
he
will
now
tell
them
what
it
is
not
a
sister
or
an
immediate
daughter
of
the
sanscrit
which
romany
is
ay
but
the
scotch
are
foxes
foxes
nothing
else
than
foxes
even
like
the
gypsies
the
difference
between
the
gypsy
and
scotch
fox
being
that
the
first
is
wild
with
a
mighty
brush
the
other
a
sneak
with
a
gilt
collar
and
without
a
tail
a
charlie
the
water
person
attempts
to
be
witty
because
the
writer
has
said
that
perhaps
a
certain
old
edinburgh
porter
of
the
name
of
boee
was
perhaps
of
the
same
blood
as
a
certain
bui
a
northern
kemp
who
distinguished
himself
at
the
battle
of
horinger
bay
a
pretty
matter
forsooth
to
excite
the
ridicule
of
a
scotchman
why
is
there
a
beggar
or
trumpery
fellow
in
scotland
who
does
not
pretend
to
be
somebody
or
related
to
somebody
is
not
every
scotchman
descended
from
some
king
kemp
or
of
old
by
his
own
account
at
least
why
the
writer
would
even
go
so
far
as
to
bet
a
trifle
that
the
poor
creature
who
ridicules
boee
supposed
ancestry
has
one
of
his
own
at
least
as
grand
and
as
apocryphal
as
old
boee
of
the
high
school
the
same
charlie
the
water
person
is
mightily
indignant
that
lavengro
should
have
spoken
disrespectfully
of
william
wallace
lavengro
when
he
speaks
of
that
personage
being
a
child
of
about
ten
years
old
and
repeating
merely
what
he
had
heard
all
the
scotch
by
the
bye
for
a
great
many
years
past
have
been
great
admirers
of
william
wallace
particularly
the
charlie
the
water
people
who
in
their
verses
about
charlie
generally
contrive
to
bring
in
the
name
of
william
willie
or
wullie
wallace
the
writer
begs
leave
to
say
that
he
by
no
means
wishes
to
bear
hard
against
william
wallace
but
he
can
not
help
asking
why
if
william
willie
or
wullie
wallace
was
such
a
particularly
nice
person
did
his
brother
scots
betray
him
to
a
certain
renowned
southern
warrior
called
edward
longshanks
who
caused
him
to
be
hanged
and
cut
into
four
in
london
and
his
quarters
to
be
placed
over
the
gates
of
certain
towns
they
got
gold
it
is
true
and
titles
very
nice
things
no
doubt
but
surely
the
life
of
a
patriot
is
better
than
all
the
gold
and
titles
in
the
world
at
least
lavengro
thinks
so
but
lavengro
has
lived
more
with
gypsies
than
scotchmen
and
gypsies
do
not
betray
their
brothers
it
would
be
some
time
before
a
gypsy
would
hand
over
his
brother
to
the
even
supposing
you
would
not
only
make
him
a
king
but
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
not
only
give
him
the
world
but
the
best
farm
on
the
holkham
estate
but
gypsies
are
wild
foxes
and
there
is
certainly
a
wonderful
difference
between
the
way
of
thinking
of
the
wild
fox
who
retains
his
brush
and
that
of
the
scurvy
kennel
creature
who
has
lost
his
tail
ah
but
thousands
of
scotch
and
particularly
the
charlie
the
water
people
will
say
we
did
sell
willie
wallace
it
was
our
forbears
who
sold
willie
wallace
if
edward
longshanks
had
asked
us
to
sell
wullie
wallace
we
would
soon
have
shown
him
that
lord
better
ye
ye
poor
trumpery
set
of
creatures
ye
would
not
have
acted
a
bit
better
than
your
forefathers
remember
how
ye
have
ever
treated
the
few
amongst
ye
who
though
born
in
the
kennel
have
shown
something
of
the
spirit
of
the
wood
many
of
ye
are
still
alive
who
delivered
over
men
quite
as
honest
and
patriotic
as
william
wallace
into
the
hands
of
an
english
minister
to
be
chained
and
transported
for
merely
venturing
to
speak
and
write
in
the
cause
of
humanity
at
the
time
when
europe
was
beginning
to
fling
off
the
chains
imposed
by
kings
and
priests
and
it
is
not
so
very
long
since
burns
to
whom
ye
are
now
building
up
obelisks
rather
higher
than
he
deserves
was
permitted
by
his
countrymen
to
die
in
poverty
and
misery
because
he
would
not
join
with
them
in
songs
of
adulation
to
kings
and
the
trumpery
great
so
say
not
that
ye
would
have
acted
with
respect
to
william
wallace
one
whit
better
than
your
fathers
and
you
in
particular
ye
children
of
charlie
whom
do
ye
write
about
a
family
of
dastard
despots
who
did
their
best
during
a
century
and
more
to
tread
out
the
few
sparks
of
independent
feeling
still
glowing
in
scotland
but
enough
has
been
said
about
ye
amongst
those
who
have
been
prodigal
in
abuse
and
defamation
of
lavengro
have
been
your
modern
radicals
and
particularly
a
set
of
people
who
filled
the
country
with
noise
against
the
king
and
queen
wellington
and
the
tories
in
about
these
people
the
writer
will
presently
have
occasion
to
say
a
good
deal
and
also
of
real
radicals
as
however
it
may
be
supposed
that
he
is
one
of
those
who
delight
to
play
the
sycophant
to
kings
and
queens
to
curry
favour
with
tories
and
to
bepraise
wellington
he
begs
leave
to
state
that
such
is
not
the
case
about
kings
and
queens
he
has
nothing
to
say
about
tories
simply
that
he
believes
them
to
be
a
bad
set
about
wellington
however
it
will
be
necessary
for
him
to
say
a
good
deal
of
mixed
import
as
he
will
subsequently
frequently
have
occasion
to
mention
him
in
connection
with
what
he
has
to
say
about
chapter
x
about
wellington
then
he
says
that
he
believes
him
at
the
present
day
to
be
infinitely
overrated
but
there
certainly
was
a
time
when
he
was
shamefully
underrated
now
what
time
was
that
why
the
time
of
radicalism
par
excellence
from
to
oh
the
abuse
that
was
heaped
on
wellington
by
those
who
traded
in
radical
cant
your
newspaper
editors
and
review
writers
and
how
he
was
sneered
at
then
by
your
whigs
and
how
faintly
supported
he
was
by
your
tories
who
were
half
ashamed
of
him
for
your
tories
though
capital
fellows
as
followers
when
you
want
nobody
to
back
you
are
the
faintest
creatures
in
the
world
when
you
cry
in
your
agony
come
and
help
me
oh
assuredly
wellington
was
infamously
used
at
that
time
especially
by
your
traders
in
radicalism
who
howled
at
and
hooted
him
said
he
had
every
vice
was
no
general
was
beaten
at
waterloo
was
a
poltroon
moreover
a
poor
illiterate
creature
who
could
scarcely
read
or
write
nay
a
principal
radical
paper
said
boldly
he
could
not
read
and
devised
an
ingenious
plan
for
teaching
wellington
how
to
read
now
this
was
too
bad
and
the
writer
being
a
lover
of
justice
frequently
spoke
up
for
wellington
saying
that
as
for
vice
he
was
not
worse
than
his
neighbours
that
he
was
brave
that
he
won
the
fight
at
waterloo
from
a
man
it
is
true
but
that
he
did
win
it
also
that
he
believed
he
had
read
rules
for
the
manual
and
platoon
exercises
to
some
purpose
moreover
that
he
was
sure
he
could
write
for
that
he
the
writer
had
once
written
to
wellington
and
had
received
an
answer
from
him
nay
the
writer
once
went
so
far
as
to
strike
a
blow
for
wellington
for
the
last
time
he
used
his
fists
was
upon
a
radical
who
was
mobbing
wellington
in
the
street
from
behind
a
rank
of
grimy
fellows
but
though
the
writer
spoke
up
for
wellington
to
a
certain
extent
when
he
was
shamefully
underrated
and
once
struck
a
blow
for
him
when
he
was
about
being
hustled
he
is
not
going
to
join
in
the
loathsome
sycophantic
nonsense
which
it
has
been
the
fashion
to
use
with
respect
to
wellington
these
last
twenty
years
now
what
have
those
years
been
to
england
why
the
years
of
everybody
in
england
having
gone
gentility
mad
during
the
last
twenty
years
and
no
people
more
so
than
your
wellington
was
turned
out
and
your
whigs
and
radicals
got
in
and
then
commenced
the
period
of
in
england
the
whigs
and
radicals
only
hated
wellington
as
long
as
the
patronage
of
the
country
was
in
his
hands
none
of
which
they
were
tolerably
sure
he
would
bestow
on
them
but
no
sooner
did
they
get
it
into
their
own
than
they
forthwith
became
admirers
of
wellington
and
why
because
he
was
a
duke
petted
at
windsor
and
by
foreign
princes
and
a
very
genteel
personage
formerly
many
of
your
whigs
and
radicals
had
scarcely
a
decent
coat
on
their
backs
but
now
the
plunder
of
the
country
was
at
their
disposal
and
they
had
as
good
a
chance
of
being
genteel
as
any
people
so
they
were
willing
to
worship
wellington
because
he
was
very
genteel
and
could
not
keep
the
plunder
of
the
country
out
of
their
hands
and
wellington
has
been
worshipped
and
prettily
so
during
the
last
fifteen
or
twenty
years
he
is
now
a
noble
creature
the
greatest
general
the
world
ever
produced
the
bravest
of
men
and
and
mercy
upon
us
the
greatest
of
military
writers
now
the
present
writer
will
not
join
in
such
sycophancy
as
he
was
not
afraid
to
take
the
part
of
wellington
when
he
was
scurvily
used
by
all
parties
and
when
it
was
dangerous
to
take
his
part
so
he
is
not
afraid
to
speak
the
naked
truth
about
wellington
in
these
days
when
it
is
dangerous
to
say
anything
about
him
but
what
is
sycophantically
laudatory
he
said
in
that
as
to
vice
wellington
was
not
worse
than
his
neighbours
but
he
is
not
going
to
say
in
that
wellington
was
a
fellow
for
he
believes
that
a
more
individual
never
existed
his
conduct
to
warner
the
poor
vaudois
and
marshal
ney
showed
that
he
said
in
that
he
was
a
good
general
and
a
brave
man
but
he
is
not
going
in
to
say
that
he
was
the
best
general
or
the
bravest
man
the
world
ever
saw
england
has
produced
a
better
general
france
two
or
three
both
countries
many
braver
men
the
son
of
the
norfolk
clergyman
was
a
brave
man
marshal
ney
was
a
braver
man
oh
that
battle
of
copenhagen
oh
that
covering
the
retreat
of
the
grand
army
and
though
he
said
in
that
he
could
write
he
is
not
going
to
say
in
that
he
is
the
best
of
all
military
writers
on
the
contrary
he
does
not
hesitate
to
say
that
any
commentary
of
julius
caesar
or
any
chapter
in
justinus
more
especially
the
one
about
the
parthians
is
worth
the
ten
volumes
of
wellington
despatches
though
he
has
no
doubt
that
by
saying
so
he
shall
especially
rouse
the
indignation
of
a
certain
newspaper
at
present
one
of
the
most
genteel
journals
imaginable
with
a
slight
tendency
to
liberalism
it
is
true
but
perfectly
genteel
which
is
nevertheless
the
very
one
which
in
swore
bodily
that
wellington
could
neither
read
nor
write
and
devised
an
ingenious
plan
for
teaching
him
how
to
read
now
after
the
above
statement
no
one
will
venture
to
say
if
the
writer
should
be
disposed
to
bear
hard
upon
radicals
that
he
would
be
influenced
by
a
desire
to
pay
court
to
princes
or
to
curry
favour
with
tories
or
from
being
a
blind
admirer
of
the
duke
of
wellington
but
the
writer
is
not
going
to
declaim
against
radicals
that
is
real
republicans
or
their
principles
upon
the
whole
he
is
something
of
an
admirer
of
both
the
writer
has
always
had
as
much
admiration
for
everything
that
is
real
and
honest
as
he
has
had
contempt
for
the
opposite
now
real
republicanism
is
certainly
a
very
fine
thing
a
much
finer
thing
than
toryism
a
system
of
common
robbery
which
is
nevertheless
far
better
than
whiggism
a
compound
of
petty
larceny
popular
instruction
and
receiving
of
stolen
goods
yes
real
republicanism
is
certainly
a
very
fine
thing
and
your
real
radicals
and
republicans
are
certainly
very
fine
fellows
or
rather
were
fine
fellows
for
the
lord
only
knows
where
to
find
them
at
the
present
day
the
writer
does
not
if
he
did
he
would
at
any
time
go
five
miles
to
invite
one
of
them
to
dinner
even
supposing
that
he
had
to
go
to
a
workhouse
in
order
to
find
the
person
he
wished
to
invite
amongst
the
real
radicals
of
england
those
who
flourished
from
the
year
to
there
were
certainly
extraordinary
characters
men
partially
insane
perhaps
but
honest
and
brave
they
did
not
make
a
market
of
the
principles
which
they
professed
and
never
intended
to
do
so
they
believed
in
them
and
were
willing
to
risk
their
lives
in
endeavouring
to
carry
them
out
the
writer
wishes
to
speak
in
particular
of
two
of
these
men
both
of
whom
perished
on
the
scaffold
their
names
were
thistlewood
and
ings
thistlewood
the
best
known
of
them
was
a
brave
soldier
and
had
served
with
distinction
as
an
officer
in
the
french
service
he
was
one
of
the
excellent
swordsmen
of
europe
had
fought
several
duels
in
france
where
it
is
no
child
play
to
fight
a
duel
but
had
never
unsheathed
his
sword
for
single
combat
but
in
defence
of
the
feeble
and
insulted
he
was
kind
and
but
of
too
great
simplicity
he
had
once
ten
thousand
pounds
left
him
all
of
which
he
lent
to
a
friend
who
disappeared
and
never
returned
a
penny
ings
was
an
uneducated
man
of
very
low
stature
but
amazing
strength
and
resolution
he
was
a
kind
husband
and
father
and
though
a
humble
butcher
the
name
he
bore
was
one
of
the
royal
names
of
the
heathen
these
two
men
along
with
five
others
were
executed
and
their
heads
hacked
off
for
levying
war
against
george
the
fourth
the
whole
seven
dying
in
a
manner
which
extorted
cheers
from
the
populace
the
most
of
then
uttering
philosophical
or
patriotic
sayings
thistlewood
who
was
perhaps
the
most
calm
and
collected
of
all
just
before
he
was
turned
off
said
we
are
now
going
to
discover
the
great
secret
ings
the
moment
before
he
was
choked
was
singing
scots
wha
ha
wi
wallace
bled
now
there
was
no
humbug
about
those
men
nor
about
many
more
of
the
same
time
and
of
the
same
principles
they
might
be
deluded
about
republicanism
as
algernon
sidney
was
and
as
brutus
was
but
they
were
as
honest
and
brave
as
either
brutus
or
sidney
and
as
willing
to
die
for
their
principles
but
the
radicals
who
succeeded
them
were
beings
of
a
very
different
description
they
jobbed
and
traded
in
republicanism
and
either
parted
with
it
or
at
the
present
day
are
eager
to
part
with
it
for
a
consideration
in
order
to
get
the
whigs
into
power
and
themselves
places
they
brought
the
country
by
their
inflammatory
language
to
the
verge
of
a
revolution
and
were
the
cause
that
many
perished
on
the
scaffold
by
their
incendiary
harangues
and
newspaper
articles
they
caused
the
bristol
conflagration
for
which
six
poor
creatures
were
executed
they
encouraged
the
mob
to
pillage
pull
down
and
burn
and
then
rushing
into
garrets
looked
on
thistlewood
tells
the
mob
the
tower
is
a
second
bastile
let
it
be
pulled
down
a
mob
tries
to
pull
down
the
tower
but
thistlewood
is
at
the
head
of
that
mob
he
is
not
peeping
from
a
garret
on
tower
hill
like
gulliver
at
lisbon
thistlewood
and
ings
say
to
twenty
ragged
individuals
liverpool
and
castlereagh
are
two
satellites
of
despotism
it
would
be
highly
desirable
to
put
them
out
of
the
way
and
a
certain
number
of
ragged
individuals
are
surprised
in
a
stable
in
cato
street
making
preparations
to
put
castlereagh
and
liverpool
out
of
the
way
and
are
fired
upon
with
muskets
by
grenadiers
and
are
hacked
at
with
cutlasses
by
bow
street
runners
but
the
twain
who
encouraged
those
ragged
individuals
to
meet
in
cato
street
are
not
far
off
they
are
not
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
in
the
borough
for
example
in
some
garret
or
obscure
cellar
the
very
first
to
confront
the
guards
and
runners
are
thistlewood
and
ings
thistlewood
whips
his
long
thin
rapier
through
smithers
lungs
and
ings
makes
a
dash
at
fitzclarence
with
his
butcher
knife
oh
there
was
something
in
those
fellows
honesty
and
courage
but
can
as
much
be
said
for
the
inciters
of
the
troubles
of
no
they
egged
on
poor
ignorant
mechanics
and
rustics
and
got
them
hanged
for
pulling
down
and
burning
whilst
the
highest
pitch
to
which
their
own
daring
ever
mounted
was
to
mob
wellington
as
he
passed
in
the
streets
now
these
people
were
humbugs
which
thistlewood
and
ings
were
not
they
raved
and
foamed
against
kings
queens
wellington
the
aristocracy
and
what
not
till
they
had
got
the
whigs
into
power
with
whom
they
were
in
secret
alliance
and
with
whom
they
afterwards
openly
joined
in
a
system
of
robbery
and
corruption
more
flagitious
than
the
old
tory
one
because
there
was
more
cant
about
it
for
themselves
they
got
consulships
commissionerships
and
in
some
instances
governments
for
their
sons
clerkships
in
public
offices
and
there
you
may
see
those
sons
with
the
badge
of
the
low
the
gilt
chain
at
the
waistcoat
pocket
and
there
you
may
hear
and
see
them
using
the
languishing
tones
and
employing
the
airs
and
graces
which
wenches
use
and
employ
who
without
being
in
the
family
way
wish
to
make
their
keepers
believe
that
they
are
in
the
family
way
assuredly
great
is
the
cleverness
of
your
radicals
of
in
providing
for
themselves
and
their
families
yet
clever
as
they
are
there
is
one
thing
they
can
not
do
they
get
governments
for
themselves
commissionerships
for
their
brothers
clerkships
for
their
sons
but
there
is
one
thing
beyond
their
craft
they
can
not
get
husbands
for
their
daughters
who
too
ugly
for
marriage
and
with
their
heads
filled
with
the
nonsense
they
have
imbibed
from
go
over
from
socinus
to
the
pope
becoming
sisters
in
fusty
convents
or
having
heard
a
few
sermons
in
chapelle
seek
for
admission
at
the
establishment
of
mother

who
after
employing
them
for
a
time
in
various
menial
offices
and
making
them
pluck
off
their
eyebrows
hair
by
hair
generally
dismisses
them
on
the
plea
of
sluttishness
whereupon
they
return
to
their
papas
to
eat
the
bread
of
the
country
with
the
comfortable
prospect
of
eating
it
still
in
the
shape
of
a
pension
after
their
sires
are
dead
papa
ex

disce

living
as
quietly
as
he
can
not
exactly
enviably
it
is
true
being
now
and
then
seen
to
cast
an
uneasy
and
furtive
glance
behind
even
as
an
animal
is
wont
who
has
lost
by
some
mischance
a
very
slight
appendage
as
quietly
however
as
he
can
and
as
dignifiedly
a
great
admirer
of
every
genteel
thing
and
genteel
personage
the
duke
in
particular
whose
despatches
bound
in
red
morocco
you
will
find
on
his
table
a
disliker
of
coarse
expressions
and
extremes
of
every
kind
with
a
perfect
horror
for
revolutions
and
attempts
to
revolutionize
exclaiming
now
and
then
as
a
shriek
escapes
from
whipped
and
bleeding
hungary
a
groan
from
gasping
poland
and
a
curse
from
trodden
but
scowling
italy
confound
the
revolutionary
canaille
why
ca
it
be
quiet
in
a
word
putting
one
in
mind
of
the
parvenu
in
the
walpurgis
nacht
the
writer
is
no
admirer
of
gothe
but
the
idea
of
that
parvenu
was
certainly
a
good
one
yes
putting
one
in
mind
of
the
individual
who
says
wir
waren
wahrlich
auch
nicht
dumm
und
thaten
oft
was
wir
nicht
sollten
doch
jetzo
kehrt
sich
alles
um
und
um
und
eben
da
wir
fest
erhalten
wollten
we
were
no
fools
as
every
one
discern
and
stopp
at
nought
our
projects
in
fulfilling
but
now
the
world
seems
turn
to
keep
it
quiet
just
when
we
were
willing
now
this
class
of
individuals
entertain
a
mortal
hatred
for
lavengro
and
its
writer
and
never
lose
an
opportunity
of
vituperating
both
it
is
true
that
such
hatred
is
by
no
means
surprising
there
is
certainly
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
lavengro
and
their
own
sons
the
one
thinking
of
independence
and
philology
whilst
he
is
clinking
away
at
kettles
and
hammering
in
dingles
the
others
stuck
up
at
public
offices
with
gilt
chains
at
their
and
giving
themselves
the
airs
and
graces
of
females
of
a
certain
description
and
there
certainly
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
the
author
of
lavengro
and
themselves
he
retaining
his
principles
and
his
brush
they
with
scarlet
breeches
on
it
is
true
but
without
their
republicanism
and
their
tails
oh
the
writer
can
well
afford
to
be
vituperated
by
your
of
some
time
ago
the
writer
was
set
upon
by
an
old
radical
and
his
wife
but
the
matter
is
too
rich
not
to
require
a
chapter
to
itself
chapter
xi
the
old
radical
this
very
dirty
man
with
his
very
dirty
face
would
do
any
dirty
act
which
would
get
him
a
place
some
time
ago
the
writer
was
set
upon
by
an
old
radical
and
his
wife
but
before
he
relates
the
manner
in
which
they
set
upon
him
it
will
be
as
well
to
enter
upon
a
few
particulars
tending
to
elucidate
their
reasons
for
so
doing
the
writer
had
just
entered
into
his
eighteenth
year
when
he
met
at
the
table
of
a
certain
an
individual
apparently
somewhat
under
thirty
of
middle
stature
a
thin
and
weaselly
figure
a
sallow
complexion
a
certain
obliquity
of
vision
and
a
large
pair
of
spectacles
this
person
who
had
lately
come
from
abroad
and
had
published
a
volume
of
translations
had
attracted
some
slight
notice
in
the
literary
world
and
was
looked
upon
as
a
kind
of
lion
in
a
small
provincial
capital
after
dinner
he
argued
a
great
deal
spoke
vehemently
against
the
church
and
uttered
the
most
desperate
radicalism
that
was
perhaps
ever
heard
saying
he
hoped
that
in
a
short
time
there
would
not
be
a
king
or
queen
in
europe
and
inveighing
bitterly
against
the
english
aristocracy
and
against
the
duke
of
wellington
in
particular
whom
he
said
if
he
himself
was
ever
president
of
an
english
republic
an
event
which
he
seemed
to
think
by
no
means
improbable
he
would
hang
for
certain
infamous
acts
of
profligacy
and
bloodshed
which
he
had
perpetrated
in
spain
being
informed
that
the
writer
was
something
of
a
philologist
to
which
character
the
individual
in
question
laid
great
pretensions
he
came
and
sat
down
by
him
and
talked
about
languages
and
literature
the
writer
who
was
only
a
boy
was
a
little
frightened
at
first
but
not
wishing
to
appear
a
child
of
absolute
ignorance
he
summoned
what
little
learning
he
had
and
began
to
blunder
out
something
about
the
celtic
languages
and
literature
and
asked
the
lion
who
he
conceived
to
be
and
whether
he
did
not
consider
the
ode
to
the
fox
by
red
rhys
of
eryry
to
be
a
masterpiece
of
pleasantry
receiving
no
answer
to
these
questions
from
the
lion
who
singular
enough
would
frequently
when
the
writer
put
a
question
to
him
look
across
the
table
and
flatly
contradict
some
one
who
was
talking
to
some
other
person
the
writer
dropped
the
celtic
languages
and
literature
and
asked
him
whether
he
did
not
think
it
a
funny
thing
that
temugin
generally
called
genghis
khan
should
have
married
the
daughter
of
prester
john
the
lion
after
giving
a
at
the
writer
through
his
left
spectacle
glass
seemed
about
to
reply
but
was
unfortunately
prevented
being
seized
with
an
irresistible
impulse
to
contradict
a
respectable
doctor
of
medicine
who
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
the
master
of
the
house
at
the
upper
and
farther
end
of
the
table
the
writer
being
a
poor
ignorant
lad
sitting
of
course
at
the
bottom
the
doctor
who
had
served
in
the
peninsula
having
observed
that
ferdinand
the
seventh
was
not
quite
so
bad
as
had
been
represented
the
lion
vociferated
that
he
was
ten
times
worse
and
that
he
hoped
to
see
him
and
the
duke
of
wellington
hanged
together
the
doctor
who
being
a
welshman
was
somewhat
of
a
warm
temper
growing
rather
red
said
that
at
any
rate
he
had
been
informed
that
ferdinand
the
seventh
knew
sometimes
how
to
behave
himself
like
a
gentleman
this
brought
on
a
long
dispute
which
terminated
rather
abruptly
the
lion
having
observed
that
the
doctor
must
not
talk
about
spanish
matters
with
one
who
had
visited
every
part
of
spain
the
doctor
bowed
and
said
he
was
right
for
that
he
believed
no
people
in
general
possessed
such
accurate
information
about
countries
as
those
who
had
travelled
them
as
bagmen
on
the
lion
asking
the
doctor
what
he
meant
the
welshman
whose
under
jaw
began
to
move
violently
replied
that
he
meant
what
he
said
here
the
matter
ended
for
the
lion
turning
from
him
looked
at
the
writer
the
writer
imagining
that
his
own
conversation
hitherto
had
been
too
trivial
and
for
the
lion
to
consider
worth
his
while
to
take
much
notice
of
it
determined
to
assume
a
little
higher
ground
and
after
repeating
a
few
verses
of
the
koran
and
gabbling
a
little
arabic
asked
the
lion
what
he
considered
to
be
the
difference
between
the
hegira
and
the
christian
era
adding
that
he
thought
the
general
computation
was
in
error
by
about
one
year
and
being
a
particularly
modest
person
chiefly
he
believes
owing
to
his
having
been
at
school
in
ireland
absolutely
blushed
at
finding
that
the
lion
returned
not
a
word
in
answer
what
a
wonderful
individual
i
am
seated
by
thought
he
to
whom
arabic
seems
a
vulgar
speech
and
a
question
about
the
hegira
not
worthy
of
an
answer
not
reflecting
that
as
lions
come
from
the
sahara
they
have
quite
enough
of
arabic
at
home
and
that
the
question
about
the
hegira
was
rather
mal
a
propos
to
one
used
to
prey
on
the
flesh
of
hadjis
now
i
only
wish
he
would
vouchsafe
me
a
little
of
his
learning
thought
the
boy
to
himself
and
in
this
wish
he
was
at
last
gratified
for
the
lion
after
asking
him
whether
he
was
acquainted
at
all
with
the
sclavonian
languages
and
being
informed
that
he
was
not
absolutely
him
by
a
display
of
sclavonian
erudition
years
rolled
by
the
writer
was
a
good
deal
about
sometimes
in
london
sometimes
in
the
country
sometimes
abroad
in
london
he
occasionally
met
the
man
of
the
spectacles
who
was
always
very
civil
to
him
and
indeed
cultivated
his
acquaintance
the
writer
thought
it
rather
odd
that
after
he
himself
had
become
acquainted
with
the
sclavonian
languages
and
literature
the
man
of
the
spectacles
talked
little
or
nothing
about
them
in
a
little
time
however
the
matter
ceased
to
cause
him
the
slightest
surprise
for
he
had
discovered
a
key
to
the
mystery
in
the
mean
time
the
man
of
spectacles
was
busy
enough
he
speculated
in
commerce
failed
and
paid
his
creditors
twenty
pennies
in
the
pound
published
translations
of
which
the
public
at
length
became
heartily
tired
having
indeed
got
an
inkling
of
the
manner
in
which
those
translations
were
got
up
he
managed
however
to
ride
out
many
a
storm
having
one
trusty
radicalism
this
he
turned
to
the
best
advantage
writing
pamphlets
and
articles
in
reviews
all
in
the
radical
interest
and
for
which
he
was
paid
out
of
the
radical
fund
which
articles
and
pamphlets
when
toryism
seemed
to
reel
on
its
last
legs
exhibited
a
slight
tendency
to
whiggism
nevertheless
his
abhorrence
of
desertion
of
principle
was
so
great
in
the
time
of
the
duke
of
wellington
administration
that
when
s
left
the
whigs
and
went
over
he
told
the
writer
who
was
about
that
time
engaged
with
him
in
a
literary
undertaking
that
the
said
s
was
a
fellow
with
a
character
so
infamous
that
any
honest
man
would
rather
that
you
spit
in
his
face
than
insult
his
ears
with
the
mention
of
the
name
of
s
the
literary
project
having
come
to
nothing
in
which
by
the
bye
the
writer
was
to
have
all
the
labour
and
his
friend
all
the
credit
provided
any
credit
should
accrue
from
it
the
writer
did
not
see
the
latter
for
some
years
during
which
time
considerable
political
changes
took
place
the
tories
were
driven
from
and
the
whigs
placed
in
office
both
events
being
brought
about
by
the
radicals
coalescing
with
the
whigs
over
whom
they
possessed
great
influence
for
the
services
which
they
had
rendered
when
the
writer
next
visited
his
friend
he
found
him
very
much
altered
his
opinions
were
by
no
means
so
exalted
as
they
had
been
he
was
not
disposed
even
to
be
rancorous
against
the
duke
of
wellington
saying
that
there
were
worse
men
than
he
and
giving
him
some
credit
as
a
general
a
hankering
after
gentility
seeming
to
pervade
the
whole
family
father
and
sons
wife
and
daughters
all
of
whom
talked
about
genteel
diversions
gentility
novels
and
even
seemed
to
look
with
favour
on
high
churchism
having
in
former
years
to
all
appearance
been
bigoted
dissenters
in
a
little
time
the
writer
went
abroad
as
indeed
did
his
friend
not
however
like
the
writer
at
his
own
expense
but
at
that
of
the
country
the
whigs
having
given
him
a
travelling
appointment
which
he
held
for
some
years
during
which
he
received
upwards
of
twelve
thousand
pounds
of
the
money
of
the
country
for
services
which
will
perhaps
be
found
inscribed
on
certain
tablets
when
another
astolfo
shall
visit
the
moon
this
appointment
however
he
lost
on
the
tories
resuming
power
when
the
writer
found
him
almost
as
radical
and
patriotic
as
ever
just
engaged
in
trying
to
get
into
parliament
into
which
he
got
by
the
assistance
of
his
radical
friends
who
in
conjunction
with
the
whigs
were
just
getting
up
a
crusade
against
the
tories
which
they
intended
should
be
a
conclusive
one
a
little
time
after
the
publication
of
the
bible
in
spain
the
tories
being
still
in
power
this
individual
full
of
the
most
disinterested
friendship
for
the
author
was
particularly
anxious
that
he
should
be
presented
with
an
official
situation
in
a
certain
region
a
great
many
miles
off
you
are
the
only
person
for
that
appointment
said
he
you
understand
a
great
deal
about
the
country
and
are
better
acquainted
with
the
two
languages
spoken
there
than
any
one
in
england
now
i
love
my
country
and
have
moreover
a
great
regard
for
you
and
as
i
am
in
parliament
and
have
frequent
opportunities
of
speaking
to
the
ministry
i
shall
take
care
to
tell
them
how
desirable
it
would
be
to
secure
your
services
it
is
true
they
are
tories
but
i
think
that
even
tories
would
give
up
their
habitual
love
of
jobbery
in
a
case
like
yours
and
for
once
show
themselves
disposed
to
be
honest
men
and
gentlemen
indeed
i
have
no
doubt
they
will
for
having
so
deservedly
an
infamous
character
they
would
be
glad
to
get
themselves
a
little
credit
by
a
presentation
which
could
not
possibly
be
traced
to
jobbery
or
favouritism
the
writer
begged
his
friend
to
give
himself
no
trouble
about
the
matter
as
he
was
not
desirous
of
the
appointment
being
in
tolerably
easy
circumstances
and
willing
to
take
some
rest
after
a
life
of
labour
all
however
that
he
could
say
was
of
no
use
his
friend
indignantly
observing
that
the
matter
ought
to
be
taken
entirely
out
of
his
hands
and
the
appointment
thrust
upon
him
for
the
credit
of
the
country
but
may
not
many
people
be
far
more
worthy
of
the
appointment
than
myself
said
the
writer
where
said
the
friendly
radical
if
you
do
get
it
it
will
be
made
a
job
of
given
to
the
son
of
some
steward
or
perhaps
to
some
quack
who
has
done
dirty
work
i
tell
you
what
i
shall
ask
it
for
you
in
spite
of
you
i
shall
indeed
and
his
eyes
flashed
with
friendly
and
patriotic
fervour
through
the
large
pair
of
spectacles
which
he
wore
and
in
fact
it
would
appear
that
the
honest
and
friendly
patriot
put
his
threat
into
execution
i
have
spoken
said
he
more
than
once
to
this
and
that
individual
in
parliament
and
everybody
seems
to
think
that
the
appointment
should
be
given
to
you
nay
that
you
should
be
forced
to
accept
it
i
intend
next
to
speak
to
lord
a
and
so
he
did
at
least
it
would
appear
so
on
the
writer
calling
upon
him
one
evening
about
a
week
afterwards
in
order
to
take
leave
of
him
as
the
writer
was
about
to
take
a
long
journey
for
the
sake
of
his
health
his
friend
no
sooner
saw
him
than
he
started
up
in
a
violent
fit
of
agitation
and
glancing
about
the
room
in
which
there
were
several
people
amongst
others
two
whig
members
of
parliament
said
i
am
glad
you
are
come
i
was
just
speaking
about
you
this
said
he
addressing
the
two
members
is
so
and
so
the
author
of
so
and
so
the
philologist
as
i
was
telling
you
i
spoke
to
lord
a
this
day
about
him
and
said
that
he
ought
forthwith
to
have
the
head
appointment
in
and
what
did
the
fellow
say
why
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
such
an
appointment
at
all
and
if
there
were
why
and
then
he
hummed
and
ha
yes
said
he
looking
at
the
writer
he
did
indeed
what
a
scandal
what
an
infamy
but
i
see
how
it
will
be
it
will
be
a
job
the
place
will
be
given
to
some
son
of
a
steward
or
to
some
quack
as
i
said
before
oh
these
tories
well
if
this
does
not
make
one
here
he
stopped
short
crunched
his
teeth
and
looked
the
image
of
desperation
seeing
the
poor
man
in
this
distressed
condition
the
writer
begged
him
to
be
comforted
and
not
to
take
the
matter
so
much
to
heart
but
the
indignant
radical
took
the
matter
very
much
to
heart
and
refused
all
comfort
whatever
bouncing
about
the
room
and
whilst
his
spectacles
flashed
in
the
light
of
four
spermaceti
candles
exclaiming
it
will
be
a
job
a
tory
job
i
see
it
all
i
see
it
all
i
see
it
all
and
a
job
it
proved
and
a
very
pretty
job
but
no
tory
job
shortly
afterwards
the
tories
were
out
and
the
whigs
were
in
from
that
time
the
writer
heard
not
a
word
about
the
injustice
done
to
the
country
in
not
presenting
him
with
the
appointment
to
the
radical
however
was
busy
enough
to
obtain
the
appointment
not
for
the
writer
but
for
himself
and
eventually
succeeded
partly
through
radical
influence
and
partly
through
that
of
a
certain
whig
lord
for
whom
the
radical
had
done
on
a
particular
occasion
work
of
a
particular
kind
so
though
the
place
was
given
to
a
quack
and
the
whole
affair
a
very
pretty
job
it
was
one
in
which
the
tories
had
certainly
no
hand
in
the
meanwhile
however
the
friendly
radical
did
not
drop
the
writer
oh
no
on
various
occasions
he
obtained
from
the
writer
all
the
information
about
the
country
in
question
and
was
particularly
anxious
to
obtain
from
the
writer
and
eventually
did
obtain
a
copy
of
a
work
written
in
the
court
language
of
that
country
edited
by
the
writer
a
language
exceedingly
difficult
which
the
writer
at
the
expense
of
a
considerable
portion
of
his
eyesight
had
acquired
at
least
as
far
as
by
the
eyesight
it
could
be
acquired
what
use
the
writer
friend
made
of
the
knowledge
he
had
gained
from
him
and
what
use
he
made
of
the
book
the
writer
can
only
guess
but
he
has
little
doubt
that
when
the
question
of
sending
a
person
to
was
mooted
in
a
parliamentary
committee
which
it
was
at
the
instigation
of
the
writer
friend
the
radical
on
being
examined
about
the
country
gave
the
information
which
he
had
obtained
from
the
writer
as
his
own
and
flashed
the
book
and
its
singular
characters
in
the
eyes
of
the
committee
and
then
of
course
his
radical
friends
would
instantly
say
this
is
the
man
there
is
no
one
like
him
see
what
information
he
possesses
and
see
that
book
written
by
himself
in
the
court
language
of
serendib
this
is
the
only
man
to
send
there
what
a
glory
what
a
triumph
it
would
be
to
britain
to
send
out
a
man
so
deeply
versed
in
the
mysterious
lore
of
as
our
illustrious
countryman
a
person
who
with
his
knowledge
could
beat
with
their
own
weapons
the
wise
men
of
is
such
an
opportunity
to
be
lost
oh
no
surely
not
if
it
is
it
will
be
an
eternal
disgrace
to
england
and
the
world
will
see
that
whigs
are
no
better
than
tories
let
no
one
think
the
writer
uncharitable
in
these
suppositions
the
writer
is
only
too
well
acquainted
with
the
antecedents
of
the
individual
to
entertain
much
doubt
that
he
would
shrink
from
any
such
conduct
provided
he
thought
that
his
temporal
interest
would
be
forwarded
by
it
the
writer
is
aware
of
more
than
one
instance
in
which
he
has
passed
off
the
literature
of
friendless
young
men
for
his
own
after
making
them
a
slight
pecuniary
compensation
and
deforming
what
was
originally
excellent
by
interpolations
of
his
own
this
was
his
especial
practice
with
regard
to
translation
of
which
he
would
fain
be
esteemed
the
king
this
radical
literato
is
slightly
acquainted
with
four
or
five
of
the
easier
dialects
of
europe
on
the
strength
of
which
knowledge
he
would
fain
pass
for
a
universal
linguist
publishing
translations
of
pieces
originally
written
in
various
difficult
languages
which
translations
however
were
either
made
by
himself
from
literal
renderings
done
for
him
into
french
or
german
or
had
been
made
from
the
originals
into
english
by
friendless
young
men
and
then
deformed
by
his
alterations
well
the
radical
got
the
appointment
and
the
writer
certainly
did
not
grudge
it
him
he
of
course
was
aware
that
his
friend
had
behaved
in
a
very
base
manner
towards
him
but
he
bore
him
no
and
invariably
when
he
heard
him
spoken
against
which
was
frequently
the
case
took
his
part
when
no
other
person
would
indeed
he
could
well
afford
to
bear
him
no
he
had
never
sought
for
the
appointment
nor
wished
for
it
nor
indeed
ever
believed
himself
to
be
qualified
for
it
he
was
conscious
it
is
true
that
he
was
not
altogether
unacquainted
with
the
language
and
literature
of
the
country
with
which
the
appointment
was
connected
he
was
likewise
aware
that
he
was
not
altogether
deficient
in
courage
and
in
propriety
of
behaviour
he
knew
that
his
appearance
was
not
particularly
against
him
his
face
not
being
like
that
of
a
convicted
pickpocket
nor
his
gait
resembling
that
of
a
fox
who
has
lost
his
tail
yet
he
never
believed
himself
adapted
for
the
appointment
being
aware
that
he
had
no
aptitude
for
the
doing
of
dirty
work
if
called
to
do
it
nor
pliancy
which
would
enable
him
to
submit
to
scurvy
treatment
whether
he
did
dirty
work
or
not
requisites
at
the
time
of
which
he
is
speaking
indispensable
in
every
british
official
requisites
by
the
bye
which
his
friend
the
radical
possessed
in
a
high
degree
but
though
he
bore
no
towards
his
friend
his
friend
bore
anything
but
will
towards
him
for
from
the
moment
that
he
had
obtained
the
appointment
for
himself
his
mind
was
filled
with
the
most
bitter
malignity
against
the
writer
and
naturally
enough
for
no
one
ever
yet
behaved
in
a
base
manner
towards
another
without
forthwith
conceiving
a
mortal
hatred
against
him
you
wrong
another
know
yourself
to
have
acted
basely
and
are
enraged
not
against
yourself
for
no
one
hates
himself
but
against
the
innocent
cause
of
your
baseness
reasoning
very
plausibly
but
for
that
fellow
i
should
never
have
been
base
for
had
he
not
existed
i
could
not
have
been
so
at
any
rate
against
him
and
this
hatred
is
all
the
more
bitter
when
you
reflect
that
you
have
been
needlessly
base
whilst
the
tories
are
in
power
the
writer
friend
of
his
own
accord
raves
against
the
tories
because
they
do
not
give
the
writer
a
certain
appointment
and
makes
or
says
he
makes
desperate
exertions
to
make
them
do
so
but
no
sooner
are
the
tories
out
with
whom
he
has
no
influence
and
the
whigs
in
with
whom
he
or
rather
his
party
has
influence
than
he
gets
the
place
for
himself
though
according
to
his
own
expressed
opinion
an
opinion
with
which
the
writer
does
not
and
never
did
concur
the
writer
was
the
only
person
competent
to
hold
it
now
had
he
without
saying
a
word
to
the
writer
or
about
the
writer
with
respect
to
the
employment
got
the
place
for
himself
when
he
had
an
opportunity
knowing
as
he
very
well
knew
himself
to
be
utterly
unqualified
for
it
the
transaction
though
a
piece
of
jobbery
would
not
have
merited
the
title
of
a
base
transaction
as
the
matter
stands
however
who
can
avoid
calling
the
whole
affair
not
only
a
piece
of
come
come
out
with
the
word
scoundrelism
on
the
part
of
the
writer
friend
but
a
most
curious
piece
of
scoundrelism
and
who
with
any
knowledge
of
fallen
human
nature
can
wonder
at
the
writer
friend
entertaining
towards
him
a
considerable
portion
of
gall
and
malignity
this
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
writer
friend
was
wonderfully
increased
by
the
appearance
of
lavengro
many
passages
of
which
the
radical
in
his
foreign
appointment
applied
to
himself
and
family
one
or
two
of
his
children
having
gone
over
to
popery
the
rest
become
members
of
platitude
chapel
and
the
minds
of
all
being
filled
with
ultra
notions
of
gentility
the
writer
hearing
that
his
old
friend
had
returned
to
england
to
apply
he
believes
for
an
increase
of
salary
and
for
a
title
called
upon
him
unwillingly
it
is
true
for
he
had
no
wish
to
see
a
person
for
whom
though
he
bore
him
no
he
could
not
avoid
feeling
a
considerable
portion
of
contempt
the
truth
is
that
his
sole
object
in
calling
was
to
endeavour
to
get
back
a
piece
of
literary
property
which
his
friend
had
obtained
from
him
many
years
previously
and
which
though
he
had
frequently
applied
for
it
he
never
could
get
back
well
the
writer
called
he
did
not
get
his
property
which
indeed
he
had
scarcely
time
to
press
for
being
almost
instantly
attacked
by
his
good
friend
and
his
wife
yes
it
was
then
that
the
author
was
set
upon
by
an
old
radical
and
his
wife
the
wife
who
looked
the
very
image
of
shame
and
malignity
did
not
say
much
it
is
true
but
encouraged
her
husband
in
all
he
said
both
of
their
own
accord
introduced
the
subject
of
lavengro
the
radical
called
the
writer
a
grumbler
just
as
if
there
had
ever
been
a
greater
grumbler
than
himself
until
by
the
means
above
described
he
had
obtained
a
place
he
said
that
the
book
contained
a
melancholy
view
of
human
nature
just
as
if
anybody
could
look
in
his
face
without
having
a
melancholy
view
of
human
nature
on
the
writer
quietly
observing
that
the
book
contained
an
exposition
of
his
principles
the
replied
that
he
cared
nothing
for
his
principles
which
was
probably
true
it
not
being
likely
that
he
would
care
for
another
person
principles
after
having
shown
so
thorough
a
disregard
for
his
own
the
writer
said
that
the
book
of
course
would
give
offence
to
humbugs
the
radical
then
demanded
whether
he
thought
him
a
humbug
the
wretched
wife
was
the
radical
protection
even
as
he
knew
she
would
be
it
was
on
her
account
that
the
writer
did
not
kick
his
good
friend
as
it
was
he
looked
at
him
in
the
face
and
thought
to
himself
how
is
it
possible
i
should
think
you
a
humbug
when
only
last
night
i
was
taking
your
part
in
a
company
in
which
everybody
called
you
a
humbug
the
radical
probably
observing
something
in
the
writer
eye
which
he
did
not
like
became
all
on
a
sudden
abjectly
submissive
and
professing
the
highest
admiration
for
the
writer
begged
him
to
visit
him
in
his
government
this
the
writer
promised
faithfully
to
do
and
he
takes
the
present
opportunity
of
performing
his
promise
this
is
one
of
the
calumniators
of
lavengro
and
its
author
were
the
writer
on
his
deathbed
he
would
lay
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
say
that
he
does
not
believe
that
there
is
one
trait
of
exaggeration
in
the
portrait
which
he
has
drawn
this
is
one
of
the
calumniators
of
lavengro
and
its
author
and
this
is
one
of
the
genus
who
after
having
railed
against
jobbery
for
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
century
at
present
batten
on
large
official
salaries
which
they
do
not
earn
england
is
a
great
country
and
her
interests
require
that
she
should
have
many
a
official
both
at
home
and
abroad
but
will
england
long
continue
a
great
country
if
the
care
of
her
interests
both
at
home
and
abroad
is
in
many
instances
intrusted
to
beings
like
him
described
above
whose
only
recommendation
for
an
official
appointment
was
that
he
was
deeply
versed
in
the
secrets
of
his
party
and
of
the
whigs
before
he
concludes
the
writer
will
take
the
liberty
of
saying
of
lavengro
that
it
is
a
book
written
for
the
express
purpose
of
inculcating
virtue
love
of
country
learning
manly
pursuits
and
genuine
religion
for
example
that
of
the
church
of
england
and
for
awakening
a
contempt
for
nonsense
of
every
kind
and
a
hatred
for
priestcraft
more
especially
that
of
rome
and
in
conclusion
with
respect
to
many
passages
of
his
book
in
which
he
has
expressed
himself
in
terms
neither
measured
nor
mealy
he
will
beg
leave
to
observe
in
the
words
of
a
great
poet
who
lived
a
profligate
life
it
is
true
but
who
died
a
sincere
penitent
thanks
after
god
to
good
bishop
burnet
all
this
with
indignation
i
have
at
the
pretending
part
of
this
proud
world
who
swollen
with
selfish
vanity
devise
false
freedoms
formal
cheats
and
holy
lies

genteel
with

seems
to
be
synonymous
with
gentile
and
gentoo
if
so
the
manner
in
which
it
has
been
applied
for
ages
ceases
to
surprise
for
genteel
is
heathenish
ideas
of
barbaric
pearl
and
gold
glittering
armour

tortures
and
lust
should
always

gentil

he
certainly
could
not
have
applied
the
word
better
than
to
the
strong
norman
thief
armed
without
one
particle
of
truth
or
generosity
for
a
person
to
be
a

of

that
is
heathenism
should
have
no
such
feelings
and
indeed
the
admirers
of
gentility
seldom
or
never
associate
any
such
feelings
with
it
it
was
from
the
norman
the
worst
of
all
robbers
and
miscreants
who
built
strong
castles
garrisoned
them
with
devils
and
tore
out
poor
wretches
eyes
as
the
saxon
chronicle
says
that
the
english
got
their
detestable
word
genteel
what
could
ever
have
made
the
english
such
admirers
of
gentility
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
for
during
three
hundred
years
they
suffered
enough
by
it
their
genteel
norman
landlords
were
their
scourgers
their
torturers
the
plunderers
of
their
homes
the
dishonourers
of
their
wives
and
the
deflourers
of
their
daughters
perhaps
after
all
fear
is
at
the
root
of
the
english
veneration
for
gentility
gentle
and
gentlemanly
may
be
derived
from
the
same
root
as
genteel
but
nothing
can
be
more
distinct
from
the
mere
genteel
than
the
ideas
which
enlightened
minds
associate
with
these
words
gentle
and
gentlemanly
mean
something
kind
and
genial
genteel
that
which
is
glittering
or
gaudy
a
person
can
be
a
gentleman
in
rags
but
nobody
can
be
genteel
the
writer
has
been
checked
in
print
by
the
scotch
with
being
a
norfolk
man
surely
surely
these
latter
times
have
not
been
exactly
the
ones
in
which
it
was
expedient
for
scotchmen
to
check
the
children
of
any
county
in
england
with
the
place
of
their
birth
more
especially
those
who
have
had
the
honour
of
being
born
in
norfolk
times
in
which
british
fleets
commanded
by
scotchmen
have
returned
laden
with
anything
but
laurels
from
foreign
shores
it
would
have
been
well
for
britain
had
she
had
the
old
norfolk
man
to
dispatch
to
the
baltic
or
the
black
sea
lately
instead
of
scotch
admirals
as
the
present
work
will
come
out
in
the
midst
of
a
vehement
political
contest
people
may
be
led
to
suppose
that
the
above
was
written
expressly
for
the
time
the
writer
therefore
begs
to
state
that
it
was
written
in
the
year
he
can
not
help
adding
that
he
is
neither
whig
tory
nor
radical
and
cares
not
a
straw
what
party
governs
england
provided
it
is
governed
well
but
he
has
no
hopes
of
good
government
from
the
whigs
it
is
true
that
amongst
them
there
is
one
very
great
man
lord
palmerston
who
is
indeed
the
sword
and
buckler
the
chariots
and
the
horses
of
the
party
but
it
is
impossible
for
his
lordship
to
govern
well
with
such
colleagues
as
he
has
colleagues
which
have
been
forced
upon
him
by
family
influence
and
who
are
continually
pestering
him
into
measures
anything
but
conducive
to
the
honour
and
interest
if
palmerston
would
govern
well
he
must
get
rid
of
them
but
from
that
step
with
all
his
courage
and
all
his
greatness
he
will
shrink
yet
how
proper
and
easy
a
step
it
would
be
he
could
easily
get
better
but
scarcely
worse
associates
they
appear
to
have
one
object
in
view
and
only
one
jobbery
it
was
chiefly
owing
to
a
most
flagitious
piece
of
jobbery
which
one
of
his
lordship
principal
colleagues
sanctioned
and
promoted
that
his
lordship
experienced
his
late
parliamentary
disasters
a
fact
