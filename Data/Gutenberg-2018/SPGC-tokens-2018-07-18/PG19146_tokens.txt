introduction
once
the
author
awoke
to
a
painful
reflection
that
he
knew
no
place
well
though
his
occupation
had
taken
him
to
many
and
that
after
years
of
describing
localities
and
society
he
would
be
identified
with
none
where
shall
i
begin
to
rove
within
confines
he
asked
feeling
the
vacant
spaces
in
his
nature
the
want
of
all
those
birds
forest
trees
household
habits
weeds
instincts
of
the
brooks
and
tints
and
tones
of
the
local
species
which
lie
in
some
neighborhood
compass
and
complete
the
pastoral
mind
numerous
districts
rose
up
and
contended
together
each
attractive
from
some
striking
scene
or
bold
contrast
or
lovely
face
and
wiser
policy
might
have
led
his
inclinations
to
one
of
these
redundant
perhaps
in
wealth
or
literary
appreciation
yet
the
heart
began
to
turn
as
in
first
love
or
vagrancy
almost
as
sweet
to
the
little
lowly
region
where
his
short
childhood
was
lived
and
where
the
unknown
generations
of
his
people
darkened
the
sand
the
peninsula
between
the
chesapeake
and
the
delaware
far
down
this
peninsula
lies
the
old
town
of
snow
hill
on
the
border
of
virginia
there
the
pilgrim
entered
the
and
asked
to
see
an
early
book
of
wills
and
in
it
he
turned
to
the
name
of
a
maternal
ancestor
of
whom
grand
tales
had
been
told
him
by
an
aged
relative
his
breath
was
almost
taken
by
finding
the
following
provisions
dated
february
i
give
and
bequeath
to
my
son
ralph
milbourn
my
best
hat
to
him
and
his
assignees
forever
and
no
more
of
my
estate
i
give
to
thomas
milbourn
my
small
iron
kettle
my
brandy
still
all
my
my
and
fifteen
pounds
bond
that
he
gave
to
my
daughter
grace
milbourn
the
next
day
a
doctor
took
the
author
on
his
rounds
through
the
forest
as
a
neighboring
tract
was
almost
too
invidiously
called
and
through
a
deserted
village
almost
of
the
date
of
these
wills
everywhere
he
went
the
entailed
hat
seemed
to
the
stranger
in
the
land
of
his
forefathers
to
appear
in
the
vistas
as
if
some
odd
reverend
avoided
being
was
wearing
it
down
the
defiles
of
time
now
like
hester
prynne
wearing
her
scarlet
letter
and
now
like
gaston
in
his
iron
mask
this
being
took
both
sexes
and
different
characters
as
the
author
weighed
the
probabilities
of
its
existence
at
last
he
began
to
know
it
and
started
to
portray
it
in
a
little
tale
the
story
broke
from
its
confines
as
his
own
family
generation
had
broken
from
that
forest
and
sought
a
larger
hemisphere
yet
wherever
the
mystic
hat
proceeded
his
truant
fancy
had
also
been
led
by
his
mother
hand
often
had
she
told
him
of
old
patty
cannon
and
her
kidnapper
den
and
her
death
in
the
jail
of
his
native
town
he
found
the
legend
of
that
dreaded
woman
had
strengthened
instead
of
having
faded
with
time
and
her
haunts
preserved
and
of
her
deeds
to
be
still
living
hence
this
romance
has
much
local
truth
in
it
and
is
not
only
the
narration
of
an
episode
but
the
story
of
a
large
region
comprehending
three
state
jurisdictions
and
also
of
that
period
when
modern
life
arose

the

princess
anne
as
its
royal
name
implies
is
an
old
seat
of
justice
and
town
on
the
eastern
shore
the
ancient
county
of
somerset
having
been
divided
many
years
before
the
revolutionary
war
and
its
courts
separated
the
original
faded
from
the
world
and
the
forest
pines
have
concealed
its
site
two
new
towns
arose
and
flourish
yet
around
the
original
records
gathered
into
their
plain
brick
offices
and
he
would
be
a
forgetful
visitor
in
princess
anne
who
would
not
say
it
had
the
better
society
he
would
get
assurances
of
this
from
the
best
people
living
there
and
yet
more
solemn
assurances
from
the
two
venerable
churches
presbyterian
and
episcopalian
whose
upright
or
recumbent
or
in
family
rows
say
in
epitaphs
latinized
poetical
or
pious
belonged
to
the
society
of
princess
anne
that
at
least
is
the
impression
left
on
the
visitor
as
he
wanders
amid
their
myrtle
and
creeper
or
receives
on
the
wide
loamy
streets
the
bows
of
the
lawyers
and
their
clients
there
were
but
two
eccentric
men
living
in
princess
anne
in
the
early
half
of
our
century
and
both
of
them
were
identified
by
their
hats
the
first
was
jack
wonnell
a
poor
fellow
of
some
remote
origin
who
had
once
attended
an
auction
and
bought
a
quarter
gross
of
beaver
hats
although
that
happened
years
before
our
story
opens
and
the
fashions
had
changed
jack
produced
a
new
hat
from
the
stock
no
oftener
than
when
he
had
well
worn
its
predecessor
and
at
the
rate
of
two
hats
a
year
was
very
slowly
extinguishing
the
store
like
most
people
who
frequent
auctions
he
was
not
provident
except
in
hats
and
presented
a
startling
appearance
in
his
patched
and
shrunken
raiment
when
he
mounted
a
bright
new
tile
and
took
to
the
sidewalk
his
name
had
become
in
all
grades
of
society
the
other
eccentric
citizen
was
the
subject
of
a
real
mystery
and
even
more
burlesque
he
wore
a
hat
apparently
more
than
a
century
old
of
a
tall
steeple
crown
and
stiff
wavy
brim
and
nearly
twice
as
high
as
the
cylinders
or
high
hats
of
these
days
it
had
been
rubbed
and
recovered
and
cleaned
and
straightened
until
its
grotesque
appearance
was
infinitely
increased
if
the
wearer
had
walked
out
of
the
court
of
king
james
directly
into
our
times
and
presence
he
could
not
have
produced
a
more
singular
effect
he
did
not
wear
this
hat
on
every
occasion
nor
every
day
but
always
on
sabbaths
and
holidays
on
funeral
or
corporate
celebrations
on
certain
english
church
days
and
whenever
he
wore
the
remainder
of
his
extra
suit
which
was
likewise
of
the
kind
and
terminated
by
greenish
gaiters
nearly
the
counterpart
in
color
of
the
hat
to
daily
business
he
wore
a
cheap
common
broadbrim
but
sometimes
for
several
days
on
freak
or
unknown
method
he
wore
this
steeple
hat
and
strangers
in
the
place
generally
got
an
opportunity
to
see
it
meshach
milburn
or
was
a
penurious
grasping
hardly
social
man
of
neighborhood
origin
but
of
a
family
generally
unsuccessful
and
undistinguished
which
had
been
said
to
be
dying
out
for
so
many
years
that
it
seemed
to
be
always
a
remnant
yet
never
quite
gone
he
alone
of
the
milburns
had
lifted
himself
out
of
the
forest
region
of
somerset
and
settled
in
the
town
and
by
silence
frugality
hard
bargaining
and
finally
by
had
become
a
person
of
unknown
means
himself
almost
unknown
he
was
ostensibly
a
merchant
or
storekeeper
and
did
deal
in
various
kinds
of
things
keeping
no
clerk
or
attendant
but
a
negro
named
samson
who
knew
as
little
about
his
mind
and
affections
as
the
rest
of
the
town
business
was
to
clean
and
produce
the
mysterious
hat
which
he
knew
to
be
required
every
time
he
saw
his
master
shave
as
soon
as
the
and
hone
were
agitated
samson
without
inquiry
went
into
a
big
green
chest
in
the
bedroom
over
the
old
wooden
store
and
drew
out
of
a
leather
the
where
meshach
milburn
himself
always
sacredly
replaced
it
then
samson
hat
as
the
boys
called
him
exercised
his
brush
vigorously
and
put
the
queer
old
in
as
formal
shape
as
possible
and
he
silently
attended
to
its
rehabilitation
through
the
medium
of
the
village
hatter
never
leaving
the
shop
until
the
tile
had
been
repaired
and
suffering
none
whatever
to
handle
it
except
the
mechanic
in
addition
to
this
samson
cooked
his
master
food
and
performed
rough
work
around
the
store
but
had
no
other
known
qualification
for
a
confidential
servant
except
his
bodily
power
he
was
now
old
probably
sixty
but
still
a
most
formidable
pugilist
and
he
had
caught
running
afoot
the
last
wild
deer
in
the
county
though
not
a
drinking
man
samson
hat
never
let
a
year
pass
without
having
a
personal
battle
with
some
young
willing
and
powerful
negro
his
physical
and
mental
system
seemed
to
require
some
such
periodical
indulgence
and
he
measured
every
negro
who
came
to
town
solely
in
the
light
of
his
prowess
at
the
appearance
of
some
herculean
or
athlete
samson
eye
would
kindle
his
smile
start
up
and
his
friendly
salutation
would
be
you
a
man
as
good
as
me
he
was
never
whipped
rumor
said
but
by
an
inoffensive
black
whom
he
challenged
and
compelled
to
fight
befo
god
man
i
never
see
you
befo
jined
de
church
i
kint

i
never
did
do
it
ca

answered
samson
you
too
a

froo
somerset
county
square
off
or
you
ketch
it
den
if
i
must
i
must
de
lord
forgive
me
and
after
a
tremendous
battle
the
came
off
nearly
conqueror
whenever
samson
indulged
his
gladiatorial
propensities
he
disappeared
into
the
forest
whence
he
came
and
being
a
free
man
of
mental
independence
equal
to
his
nerve
he
merely
waited
in
his
lonely
cabin
until
meshach
milburn
sent
him
word
to
return
then
silently
the
old
negro
resumed
his
place
looked
contrition
took
the
few
bitter
overbearing
words
of
his
master
silently
and
brushed
the
ancient
hat
meshach
kept
him
respectably
dressed
but
paid
him
no
wages
the
negro
had
what
he
wanted
but
wanted
little
on
more
than
one
occasion
the
court
had
imposed
penalties
on
samson
breaches
of
the
peace
and
he
lay
in
jail
unsolicitous
and
proud
until
meshach
milburn
paid
the
fine
which
he
did
grudgingly
for
money
was
meshach
sole
pursuit
and
he
spent
nothing
upon
himself
without
a
vice
it
appeared
that
meshach
milburn
had
not
an
emotion
hardly
a
virtue
he
had
neither
pity
nor
curiosity
visitors
nor
friends
professions
nor
apologies
two
or
three
times
he
had
been
summoned
on
a
jury
when
he
put
on
his
best
suit
and
his
and
formally
went
through
his
task
he
attended
the
episcopal
worship
every
sunday
and
great
holiday
wearing
inevitably
the
ancient
tile
which
often
of
itself
drew
audience
more
than
the
sermon
he
gave
a
very
small
sum
of
money
and
took
a
cheap
pew
and
read
from
his
many
admonitions
he
did
not
follow
he
was
not
litigious
but
there
was
no
evading
the
perfectness
of
his
contracts
his
searching
and
large
hazel
eyes
almost
proud
and
quite
unkindly
and
his
hair
were
the
leading
elements
of
a
face
not
large
but
appearing
so
as
if
the
buried
will
of
some
long
frivolous
family
had
been
restored
and
concentrated
in
this
man
and
had
given
a
bilious
power
to
his
brows
and
jaws
and
glances
his
eccentricity
had
no
apparent
harmony
with
anything
else
nor
any
especial
sensibility
about
it
the
boys
hooted
his
hat
and
the
little
girls
often
joined
in
crying
he
got
it
on
loose
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
anybody
until
once
at
court
time
some
carousing
fellows
hired
jack
wonnell
to
walk
up
to
meshach
milburn
and
ask
to
swap
a
new
for
the
old
decrepit
looking
at
wonnell
sternly
in
the
face
meshach
hissed
you
miserable
vagrant
nature
meant
you
to
go
bareheaded
beware
when
you
speak
to
me
again
i
was
afraid
of
him
said
jack
wonnell
afterwards
he
seemed
to
have
a
loaded
pistol
in
each
eye
no
other
incident
beyond
indiscriminate
ridicule
was
recorded
of
this
hat
except
once
when
a
group
of
little
children
in
front
of
judge
custis
house
began
to
whisper
and
titter
and
one
bolder
than
the
rest
the
judge
daughter
gravely
walked
up
to
the
unsocial
man
it
was
the
first
of
may
and
he
was
in
his
best
suit
sir
she
said
may
i
put
a
rose
in
your
old
hat
the
harsh
man
looked
down
at
the
little
queenly
child
standing
straight
and
slender
with
an
expression
on
her
face
of
composure
and
courtesy
then
he
looked
up
and
over
the
judge
residence
to
see
if
any
mischievous
or
presuming
person
had
prompted
this
act
no
one
was
in
sight
and
the
other
children
had
run
away
why
do
you
offer
me
a
flower
he
said
but
with
no
tenderness
because
i
thought
such
a
very
old
hat
might
improve
with
a
rose
he
hesitated
a
minute
the
little
girl
as
if
received
his
strong
stare
steadily
he
took
off
the
venerable
old
and
put
it
in
the
pretty
maid
hand
she
fixed
a
white
rose
to
it
and
then
he
placed
the
hat
and
rose
again
on
his
head
and
took
a
small
piece
of
gold
from
his
pocket
will
you
take
this
my
father
will
not
let
me
sir
meshach
milburn
replaced
the
coin
and
said
nothing
else
but
walked
down
the
streets
amid
more
than
the
usual
simpering
and
the
door
of
the
little
rickety
storehouse
closed
behind
him
chapter
ii
judge
and
daughter
judge
custis
was
the
most
important
man
in
the
county
he
belonged
to
the
oldest
colonial
family
of
distinction
the
custises
of
northampton
whose
fortune
beginning
with
king
charles
ii
and
his
tavern
credits
in
rotterdam
ended
in
endowing
colonel
george
washington
with
a
mite
the
judge
at
princess
anne
was
the
most
handsome
man
the
father
of
the
finest
family
of
sons
and
daughters
the
best
in
estate
most
various
in
knowledge
and
the
most
convivial
of
custises
in
that
region
of
the
eastern
shore
there
is
so
little
diversity
of
productions
the
ocean
and
the
loam
alone
contributing
to
man
that
judge
custis
had
an
exaggerated
reputation
as
a
mineralogist
he
had
begun
to
manufacture
iron
out
of
the
bog
ores
found
in
the
swamps
and
hummocks
of
a
neighboring
district
and
with
the
tastes
of
a
landholding
and
slaveholding
family
had
erected
around
his
furnace
a
considerable
town
his
own
residence
as
proprietor
conspicuous
in
the
midst
there
he
spent
a
large
part
of
the
time
and
not
always
in
the
company
of
his
family
entertaining
friends
from
the
distant
cities
enjoying
the
luxuries
of
terrapin
duck
and
wines
and
as
rumor
said
in
the
forest
all
the
pleasures
of
a
russian
or
german
nobleman
on
a
secluded
estate
he
could
lie
down
on
the
ground
with
the
barefooted

he
was
more
discriminating
rising
in
that
society
to
his
family
stature
and
surrounded
by
alliances
which
demanded
what
is
called
bearing
in
short
he
was
the
head
of
the
community
and
his
wealth
originally
considerable
had
been
augmented
by
marriage
while
his
credit
extended
to
philadelphia
and
baltimore
not
long
after
the
occurrence
of
his
young
daughter
vesta
placing
the
rose
in
meshach
milburn
mysterious
hat
judge
custis
said
to
his
lady
at
the
that
man
has
been
allowed
to
shut
himself
in
like
a
dog
too
long
he
owes
something
to
this
community
i
go
down
to
his
kennel
under
pretence
of
wanting
a
loan
and
i
do
need
some
money
for
the
furnace
he
took
his
cane
after
breakfast
and
passed
out
of
his
large
mansion
and
down
the
sidewalk
of
the
level
street
there
were
as
usually
some
negroes
around
milburn
small
store
and
samson
hat
among
them
shook
hands
with
the
judge
not
a
particle
disturbed
at
the
latter
condescension
judge
said
samson
looking
that
large
portly
gentleman
over
a
man
yet
but
de
flesh
is
a
little
soft
in
yo
muscle
judge
ah
samson
answered
custis
there
one
old
fellow
that
is
wrastling
you
time
said
the
negro
we
ca
fight
him
sho
dat
a
fack
but
good
as
any
man
in
somerset
now
except
my
daughter
boy
the
from
talbot
is
dat
boy
in
yo
family
exclaimed
samson
kindling
up
i
walk
dar
if
he
give
me
another
throw
the
judge
passed
into
the
door
of
meshach
milburn
store
a
few
negroes
and
poor
whites
were
at
the
counter
and
meshach
was
measuring
whiskey
out
to
them
by
the
cheap
dram
in
exchange
for
coonskins
and
eggs
he
looked
up
just
a
trifle
surprised
at
the
principal
man
advent
and
merely
said
without
nodding
judge
custis
never
flinched
from
anybody
but
his
intelligence
recognized
in
meshach
eyes
a
kind
of
nature
he
had
not
yet
met
though
he
was
of
universal
acquaintance
it
was
not
hostility
nor
welcome
nor
indifference
it
was
not
exactly
spirit
as
nearly
as
the
judge
could
formulate
it
the
expression
was
habitual
and
if
not
habitual
suspicion
the
feeling
most
near
it
which
comes
from
conscious
unpopularity
milburn
said
judge
custis
when
you
are
at
leisure
let
me
have
a
few
words
with
you
the
storekeeper
turned
to
the
poor
folks
in
his
little
area
and
remarked
to
them
bluntly
you
can
come
back
in
ten
minutes
they
all
went
out
without
further
command
milburn
closed
the
door
the
judge
moved
a
chair
and
sat
down
milburn
he
said
dropping
the
formal
mister
they
tell
me
you
lend
money
and
that
you
charge
well
for
it
i
am
a
borrower
sometimes
and
i
believe
in
keeping
interest
at
home
in
our
own
community
will
you
discount
my
note
at
legal
interest
never
replied
meshach
then
said
the
judge
smiling
you
put
me
to
some
inconvenience
that
more
than
legal
interest
answered
milburn
sturdily
pay
the
legal
interest
where
you
go
and
the
inconvenience
of
going
will
cost
something
too
if
you
add
your
expenses
as
liberally
as
you
incur
them
when
you
go
to
baltimore
to
legal
interest
you
are
always
paying
a
good
shave
where
you
have
risks
suggested
the
judge
there
is
some
reason
for
a
heavy
discount
but
my
property
will
enrich
this
county
and
all
the
land
you
hold
mortgages
on
bog
ore
muttered
the
i
never
lent
money
on
that
kind
of
risk
i
must
read
upon
it
they
say
manufacturing
requires
mechanical
talent
how
much
do
you
want
three
thousand
secured
upon
the
furnace
yes
meshach
computed
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
the
judge
with
easy
curiosity
studied
his
singular
face
and
figure
he
was
rather
short
and
chunky
not
weighing
more
than
one
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
with
long
fine
fingers
of
such
tracery
and
separate
action
that
every
finger
seemed
to
have
a
mind
and
function
of
its
own
looking
at
his
hands
only
one
would
have
said
there
is
here
a
pianist
a
penman
a
woman
of
definite
skill
or
a
man
of
peculiar
delicacy
all
the
fingers
were
well
produced
as
if
the
hand
instead
of
the
face
was
meant
to
be
the
mind
exponent
and
reveal
its
portrait
there
yet
the
face
of
meshach
milburn
if
more
repellent
was
uncommon
the
effects
of
one
long
diet
and
one
climate
invariable
from
generation
to
generation
and
both
low
and
uninvigorating
had
brought
to
nearly
aboriginal
form
and
lines
his
hair
and
resinous
brown
eyes
from
the
up
he
looked
like
an
indian
and
expressed
a
stolid
power
and
swarthiness
below
there
dropped
a
large
face
in
proportion
with
nothing
noticeable
about
it
except
the
nose
which
was
so
straight
prominent
and
complete
and
its
nostrils
so
sensitive
that
only
the
nose
upon
his
face
seemed
to
be
good
company
for
his
hands
when
he
confronted
one
with
his
head
thrown
back
a
little
his
brown
eyes
staring
inquiry
and
his
nose
almost
sentient
the
effect
was
that
of
a
hostile
savage
just
burst
from
the
woods
that
was
his
condition
indeed
look
at
him
in
the
eyes
said
the
he
all
forester
but
look
at
his
hand
added
some
few
observant
ones
ah
who
had
ever
shaken
that
hand
it
was
now
extended
to
the
judge
and
he
took
from
its
womanly
fingers
the
terms
of
the
loan
judge
custis
was
surprised
at
the
moderation
of
meshach
and
he
looked
up
cheerfully
into
that
ever
sentinel
face
on
which
might
have
been
printed
vive
it
not
the
goodness
of
the
security
said
meshach
i
make
it
low
to
you
socially
the
custis
pride
started
with
a
flush
to
the
judge
eyes
to
have
this
ostracised
and
hooted
shylock
intimate
that
their
relations
could
be
more
than
a
prince
to
a
pawnbroker
but
the
judge
was
a
politician
with
an
adaptable
mind
and
address
speaking
of
social
things
milburn
he
said
carelessly
our
town
is
not
so
large
that
we
do
all
see
each
other
sometimes
why
do
you
wear
that
forlorn
unsightly
hat
why
do
you
wear
the
name
oh
i
inherited
that
and
i
inherited
my
hat
there
was
a
pause
for
a
minute
but
before
the
judge
could
tell
whether
it
was
an
angry
or
an
awkward
pause
the
storekeeper
said
judge
custis
i
concede
that
you
are
the
best
bred
man
in
princess
anne
where
did
you
get
authority
to
question
another
person
about
any
decent
article
of
his
attire
i
stand
corrected
milburn
said
the
judge
good
feeling
for
you
more
than
curiosity
made
me
suggest
it
and
i
may
also
remark
to
you
sir
that
when
you
lend
me
money
you
will
always
do
it
commercially
and
not
very
well
remarked
meshach
milburn
and
if
i
ever
enter
your
door
i
will
then
take
off
my
hat
the
next
morning
meshach
milburn
surprised
samson
hat
by
saying
boy
when
you
have
another
fight
and
make
yourself
a
barbarian
again
remember
to
bring
back
from
nassawongo
furnace
about
a
peck
of
the
bog
ores
the
years
moved
on
without
much
change
in
princess
anne
the
little
manokin
river
brought
up
oysters
from
the
bay
and
carried
off
the
corn
and
produce
the
great
brick
academy
at
neighboring
lower
trappe
boarded
and
educated
the
brightest
youths
of
the
best
families
on
the
peninsula
and
these
perceived
as
the
annual
summers
brought
their
fulness
what
portion
of
their
beauty
remained
with
vesta
custis
she
was
like
helen
of
troy
a
subject
of
homage
and
dispute
in
childhood
and
became
a
woman
in
men
consideration
almost
imperceptibly
sent
to
baltimore
to
be
educated
her
return
was
followed
by
suitors
not
youthful
admirers
only
but
mature
ones
and
the
young
men
of
the
peninsula
remarked
with
chagrin
none
of
us
have
a
chance
some
great
city
nabob
will
get
her
but
the
academy
boys
and
visitors
and
the
townspeople
had
one
common
opportunity
to
see
her
and
to
hear
her
when
she
sang
every
sabbath
and
church
day
in
the
episcopal
church
her
voice
was
the
natural
expression
of
her
beauty
sweet
powerful
free
and
easily
trained
a
divine
bird
seemed
hidden
in
the
old
church
when
this
noble
yet
tender
voice
broke
forth
but
they
who
turned
to
see
the
singer
who
had
made
such
paradise
looked
almost
on
eve
herself
she
was
rather
slight
tall
and
growing
fuller
slowly
every
year
like
one
in
whom
growth
was
early
yet
long
and
who
would
wholly
mature
not
until
near
middle
life
her
head
however
was
perfection
even
in
girlhood
not
less
by
its
proportions
than
its
carriage
her
graceful
figure
bore
it
like
the
slender
setting
holding
up
the
first
splendor
of
the
peach
a
head
of
vital
and
spiritual
beauty
where
purity
and
luxuriance
woman
and
mind
dwelt
in
harmony
and
joy
as
she
seemed
ever
to
be
ripening
so
she
seemed
never
to
have
been
a
child
but
with
faculties
and
sense
clear
and
unintimidated
she
was
never
wanting
in
modesty
nor
accused
of
want
of
judge
custis
made
her
his
reliance
and
pride
she
never
reproved
his
errors
nor
treated
them
familiarly
but
settled
the
household
by
a
consent
which
all
paid
to
her
character
alone
more
than
once
she
had
appeared
at
the
furnace
mansion
when
the
judge
long
absence
had
awakened
some
jealousy
or
distrust
father
please
go
home
with
me
i
want
you
to
drive
me
back
the
easy
judge
would
look
a
slight
protest
but
at
the
soft
spirited
command
come
sir
you
ca
stay
here
any
more
dismissed
his
companions
and
took
his
place
at
the
head
of
princess
anne
society
vesta
was
almost
a
brunette
with
the
rich
colors
of
her
type
eyebrows
like
the
raven
wing
ripe
red
lips
and
hair
whose
darkness
and
length
released
from
the
crown
into
which
she
wound
it
might
have
spun
her
garments
her
eyes
were
of
a
in
which
the
lights
had
the
effect
of
black
she
was
dark
with
sky
breaking
through
like
the
rich
dusk
and
twilights
over
the
chesapeake
people
wondered
that
with
such
beauty
ease
and
accomplishments
she
was
not
proud
but
her
pride
was
too
ethereal
to
be
seen
it
was
not
the
vain
consciousness
of
gifts
and
endowments
but
the
serene
sense
of
worthiness
of
unimpaired
health
honor
and
descent
which
made
her
kind
and
thoughtful
to
a
degree
only
less
than
piety
grateful
for
her
social
rank
and
parentage
she
adorned
but
did
not
forget
them
the
suitors
who
came
for
her
were
weighed
in
this
scale
of
perfect
desert
to
be
sons
of
such
parents
and
associates
of
her
married
sisters
and
not
one
had
survived
the
test
yet
none
knew
where
he
failed
vesta
is
too
good
for
any
of
them
exclaimed
the
judge
on
more
than
one
occasion
when
i
get
the
furnace
in
such
shape
that
it
will
run
itself
i
will
take
my
daughter
to
europe
and
give
her
a
musical
education
in
truth
the
judge
had
expectations
of
his
daughter
for
the
reputation
he
had
attained
as
a
manufacturer
was
not
without
its
drawbacks
he
maintained
two
establishments
he
supported
a
large
body
of
laborers
and
dependents
some
of
whom
he
had
brought
from
distant
places
under
contract
the
experiment
in
which
he
had
embarked
was
still
an
experiment
and
he
was
subject
to
the
knowledge
and
judgment
of
his
manager
being
himself
rather
the
patron
than
the
manufacturer
at
the
works
many
days
when
he
was
supposed
to
be
testing
the
percentage
and
mixture
of
his
ores
he
was
gunning
off
on
the
ocean
bars
crabbing
on
whollop
beach
or
hunting
up
questionable
company
among
the
forest
girls
or
around
the
oystermen
or
wrecker
cabins
he
had
plenty
of
property
and
family
endorsers
however
and
seldom
failed
to
have
a
satisfactory
interview
with
meshach
milburn
who
was
now
assisting
him
at
least
once
a
quarter
to
keep
both
principal
and
interest
at
home
the
judge
had
grown
thicker
with
meshach
but
the
storekeeper
merely
listened
and
assented
and
took
no
pains
to
incur
another
criticism
on
his
motives
meshach
wore
his
great
hat
as
ever
to
church
and
on
festive
days
and
it
was
still
derided
and
held
to
be
the
town
wonder
vesta
custis
often
saw
the
odd
little
man
come
into
church
while
she
was
singing
and
she
fancied
that
his
large
coarse
ears
were
turned
to
receive
the
music
she
was
making
and
she
faintly
remembered
that
once
she
had
held
in
her
hands
that
wonderful
hat
with
its
copper
buckle
in
the
band
and
stiff
wide
brim
flowing
in
a
wave
more
than
that
she
knew
nothing
except
that
the
wearer
was
an
grasping
creature
a
forester
without
social
propensities
or
indeed
any
human
attachments
the
negro
who
abode
under
his
roof
was
beloved
compared
to
the
sordid
master
and
all
testimony
concurred
that
meshach
milburn
deserved
neither
commiseration
friendship
nor
recognition
her
father
however
indulgent
in
all
things
said
the
had
a
good
mind
and
was
no
serf
milburn
had
ceased
to
deal
with
negroes
or
dispense
drams
his
wealth
was
now
known
to
be
more
than
considerable
he
had
ceased
also
to
lend
money
on
the
surrounding
farms
and
rumors
came
across
the
bay
that
he
was
a
holder
of
stocks
and
mortgages
on
the
western
shore
and
in
baltimore
and
pennsylvania
the
little
town
of
princess
anne
was
full
of
speculations
about
him
and
even
his
age
was
uncertain
jack
wonnell
had
measured
it
by
hats
said
jack
i
bought
my
the

i
wear
two
a
year
i
come
out
every
fourth
of
july
and
christmas
day
i
counted
what
was
left
and
i
reckoned
that
meshach
could
be
at
the
wust
vesta
custis
was
only
twenty
years
old
when
the
townsfolk
thought
she
must
be
so
long
had
she
been
the
beauty
of
somerset
her
mother
had
always
looked
with
apprehension
on
the
possible
time
when
her
daughter
would
marry
and
leave
her
for
judge
custis
had
long
ceased
to
have
the
full
confidence
of
his
lady
whose
fortune
he
had
embarked
without
return
on
ventures
still
in
doubt
and
he
always
waived
the
subject
when
it
was
broached
or
remarked
that
no
loss
was
possible
in
his
hands
while
custis
lived
chapter
iii
the
foresters
one
saturday
afternoon
in
october
meshach
milburn
drew
out
his
razor
cup
and
hone
and
prepared
to
shave
albeit
his
beard
was
never
more
than
harmless
down
by
a
sort
of
capillary
attraction
samson
hat
divined
his
purpose
and
opening
the
big
green
chest
brought
out
the
mysterious
hat
put
it
down
commanded
the
go
out
and
hire
me
a
carriage
with
two
horses
horses
do
you
mind
samson
dropped
the
hat
in
wonderment
make
yourself
decent
added
meshach
i
want
you
to
drive
go
with
me
and
keep
with
me
do
you
understand
yes
marster
when
the
negro
departed
meshach
himself
took
up
the
tall
green
buckled
hat
with
the
stiff
broad
piratical
brim
he
looked
it
over
long
and
hard
vanity
vanity
he
murmured
vanity
and
habit
i
dare
not
disown
thee
now
because
they
give
thee
ridicule
and
without
thee
they
would
give
me
nothing
but
hate
the
people
around
the
tavern
and
saw
with
surprise
too
great
for
jeering
the
go
past
in
a
carriage
driven
by
his
negro
and
with
two
horses
jack
wonnell
took
off
his
shining
beaver
to
cheer
as
the
phenomenal
team
receded
the
old
cry
ran
however
down
the
stilly
street
he
got
it
on
meshach
loose
the
carriage
proceeded
out
the
forest
road
and
soon
entered
upon
the
sandy
region
called
or
hardship
here
the
roads
were
sandy
as
the
hummocks
and
hills
in
the
rear
of
a
sea
beach
and
the

in
occasional

where
the

clay
was
exposed
some
forester
unpainted
hut
sat
black
and
smoking
on
the
slope
without
a
an
ornament
or
anything
to
relieve
life
from
its
monotony
and
isolation
but
where
the
rills
ran
off
to
the
continuous
swamps
the
leafage
started
up
in
splendrous
versatility
the
maple
stood
revealed
in
all
its
fair
light
harmonies
the
magnolia
drooped
its
ivory
tassels
and
scented
the
forest
with
perfume
the
kalmia
and
the
alder
gave
undergrowth
and
brilliancy
to
the

hoary

their
venerable

from
angular

the
bald
cypress
overhanging
its
evergreen
kinsman
and
looking
down
upon
the
in
autumn
like
some
hermit
artist
on
the
rich
pigments
on
his
palette
but
nothing
looked
so
noble
as
the
sweet
gum
which
rose
like
a
giant
plume
of
yellow
and
orange
a
chief
in
joyous
finery
where
the
cypress
was
only
a
faded
philosopher
beside
such
a
tall
samson
hat
reined
in
where
a
shone
at
the
bottom
of
a
hollow
cypress
he
borrowed
a
bucket
from
the
hut
across
the
road
and
watered
the

a

cried
out
impudently

milburn
did
not
answer
but
marked
the
poor
small
corn

ungathered
on
the
fodderless
stalks
the

of
of
which
the

said
until
they
passed
the
settled
part
of
the
forest
and
entered
one
of
the
many
straight
aisles
of
sky
and
sand
among
the
pines
which
had
been
opened
on
the
great
furnace
tract
of
judge
custis
he
had
here
several
thousand
acres
and
for
miles
the
roadways
were
cleft
towards
the
horizon
the
moon
rose
behind
them
as
they
entered
the
furnace
village
and
they
saw
the
lights
twinkle
through
the
open
doors
of
many
cottages
and
the
furnace
flames
dart
over
the
forbidding
where
in
the
depths
grew
the
iron
ore
like
a
vegetable
creation
and
above
the
surface
on
splayed
and
conical
roots
the
hundreds
of
strong
cypresses
towered
from
the
water
between
the
steep
banks
of
pines
taller
than
the
forest
growth
this
furnace
lake
lay
black
and
white
and
burning
red
as
the
shadows
or
moonrise
or
flames
struck
upon
it
and
the
stained
water
foamed
through
the
breast
or
dam
where
the
ancient
road
crossed
between
pines
cypresses
and
of
commanding
stature
tawny
slimy
chilly
and
solemn
the
pond
repeated
the
forms
of
the

it
submerged
the
shaggy
shadows
added
depth
and
dread
to
the
effect
some
strange
birds
hooted
as
they
dipped
their
wings
in
the
surface
and
flying
upward
seemed
also
sinking
down
as
meshach
felt
the
chill
of
that
pond
he
drew
down
his
hat
and
buttoned
up
his
coat
the
earliest
fools
who
turned

chapter
iv
discovery
of
the
heirloom
judge
custis
was
in
his
bedroom
in
the
second
story
of
the
large
mansion
at
the
middle
of
the
village
and
he
was
just
recovering
from
the
effects
of
a
long
wassail
in
his
peculiar
nervous
condition
he
started
at
the
sound
of
wheels
and
drawing
his
curtains
looked
out
upon
the
long
shadow
of
an
advancing
figure
crowned
with
a
steeple
hat
this
human
shadow
strengthened
and
faded
in
the
alternating
light
until
it
was
defined
against
his
storehouse
his
warehouse
his
cabins
and
the
plain
and
it
seemed
also
against
the
wall
of
dense
forest
pines
then
footsteps
ascended
the
stairs
his
door
opened
and
meshach
milburn
with
his
holiday
hat
on
his
head
stood
on
the
threshold
his
eyes
vigilant
and
bold
as
ever
and
all
his
indian
nature
to
the
front
my
god
milburn
exclaimed
the
judge
odd
as
it
is
to
see
you
here
i
am
relieved
old
nick
i
thought
was
coming
shall
i
come
in
asked
milburn
yes
i
sleeping
off
a
little
care
and
business
let
your
man
stay
outside
on
the
porch
draw
up
a
chair
it
money
i
suppose
that
brings
you
here
the
carefully
put
his
formidable
hat
upon
a
table
took
a
distant
chair
pushed
his
gaitered
feet
out
in
front
and
laid
a
large
wallet
or
on
his
lap
then
addressing
his
whole
attention
to
the
host
he
appeared
never
to
wink
while
he
remained
judge
custis
he
said
straightforwardly
the
first
time
you
came
to
borrow
money
from
me
you
said
that
nassawongo
furnace
would
enrich
this
county
and
raise
the
value
of
my
land
yes
milburn
it
was
a
slow
enterprise
but
it
coming
all
right
i
shipped
a
thousand
tons
last
year
judge
custis
continued
the
i
told
you
when
you
made
the
first
loan
that
i
would
investigate
this
ore
i
did
so
years
ago
specimens
were
sent
by
me
to
baltimore
and
tested
there
not
content
with
that
i
have
studied
the
manufacture
of
iron
for
myself
the
society
of
princess
anne
not
grudging
me
plenty
of
solitude
and
i
know
that
every
ton
of
iron
you
make
costs
more
than
you
get
for
it
the
bog
ore
is
easy
to
smelt
but
it
is
corrupted
by
phosphate
of
iron
and
is
barely
marketable
the
judge
was
sitting
with
eyes
wide
open
and
paler
than
before
you
have
found
that
out
he
whispered
i
did
not
know
it
myself
until
within
this
year
so
help
me
god
i
knew
it
before
i
made
you
the
second
loan
why
did
you
not
tell
me
because
you
forbade
our
relations
to
be
anything
but
commercial
i
was
not
bound
to
betray
my
knowledge
why
did
you
then
from
a
commercial
view
lend
me
large
sums
of
money
again
and
again
because
said
the
coolly
you
had
other
security
you
have
a
daughter
judge
custis
broke
from
the
and
rushed
upon
meshach
milburn
heathen
and
devil
he
shouted
taking
the
by
the
throat
do
you
dare
to
mention
her
as
part
of
your
mortgage
they
struggled
together
until
a
powerful
pair
of
hands
pinioned
the
judge
and
bore
him
back
to
his
bed
samson
hat
was
the
man
judge
he
exclaimed
gentle
but
firm
you
is
a
man
but
not
as
good
as
me
cool
off
judge
i
expected
this
scene
said
meshach
milburn
it
could
not
have
been
avoided
i
was
bound
in
conscience
and
in
to
make
you
the
only
proposition
which
could
save
you
from
ruin
for
judge
custis
you
are
a
ruined
man
overcome
with
excitement
and
suspended
stimulation
the
old
judge
fell
back
on
his
pillow
and
began
to
sob
give
him
brandy
said
meshach
milburn
here
is
the
bottle
he
needs
it
now
the
wretched
gentleman
eagerly
drank
the
proffered
draught
from
the
negro
hands
his
fury
did
not
revive
and
he
covered
his
face
with
his
palms
and
moaned
piteously
judge
custis
remarked
meshach
milburn
if
the
apparent
social
distance
between
us
could
be
lessened
by
any
argument
i
might
make
one
for
the
difference
is
in
appearance
only
the
healthy
flesh
which
gives
you
and
yours
stature
and
beauty
is
a
matter
of
food
alone
my
stock
has
survived
five
generations
of
such
diet
as
has
bent
the
spines
of
the
forest
pigs
and
stunted
the
oxen
money
and
family
joy
will
give
me
children
comely
again
my
life
has
been
hard
but
pure
the
old
judge
felt
the
last
unconscious
reflection
yes
he
uttered
solemnly
no
doubt
heaven
marked
me
for
some
such
degradation
as
this
when
i
yielded
to
low
propensities
and
sought
my
pleasure
and
companions
in
the
huts
of
the
forest
you
claim
descent
from
the
stuart
restoration
i
know
the
tale
a
creditor
of
the
two
exiled
royal
brothers
for
sundry
tavern
loans
and
tipples
drew
for
his
obligation
an
office
in
virginia
seizures
confiscations
the
marriages
in
short
the
long
game
of
advantage
built
up
the
fortunes
of
the
custises
until
they
expired
in
a
certain
judge
whose
notes
of
hand
a
hard
man
held
over
the
judge
head
on
what
seemed
hard
conditions
but
conditions
in
which
was
every
quality
of
mercy
except
consideration
for
your
pride
the
judge
made
a
laugh
like
a
howl
he
exclaimed
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
ensnare
my
innocent
daughter
in
the
damned
meshes
of
your
principal
and
interest
call
it
malignity
the
visitation
of
your
unsocial
wrath
on
man
and
an
angel
but
not
mercy
then
we
will
call
it
compensation
continued
meshach
milburn
for
twenty
years
i
have
denied
myself
everything
you
denied
yourself
nothing
your
substance
is
wasted
renew
it
from
the
abundance
of
my
thrift
it
was
not
with
an
evil
design
that
i
made
myself
your
creditor
although
as
the
years
have
rolled
onward
and
solitude
chilled
my
heart
that
has
always
pined
for
human
friendship
i
could
not
but
see
the
kindling
glory
of
your
daughter
beauty
like
the
schoolboys
the
married
husbands
yes
like
the
slaves
i
had
to
admire
her
then
unknowing
how
deeply
you
were
involved
i
found
offered
to
me
for
sale
the
paper
you
had
negotiated
in
baltimore
paper
judge
custis
dishonorably
negotiated
the
rose
and
walked
to
the
sad
man
bed
and
held
the
hand
full
of
these
notes
boldly
over
him
it
was
despair
milburn
moaned
the
judge
and
so
was
my
resolution
said
i
lofty
gentleman
would
cheat
me
his
neighbor
who
have
suffered
all
the
contumely
of
this
and
on
starveling
opportunity
have
slowly
recovered
independence
now
he
shall
take
my
place
in
the
forest
or
i
will
wear
my
hat
at
the
head
of
his
family
table
a
dreadful
revenge
whispered
custis
with
a
shudder
such
a
hat
is
worse
than
a
cloven
foot
in
god
name
whence
came
that
ominous
hat
milburn
took
up
the
hat
and
held
it
before
the
lamplight
so
that
its
shadow
stood
gigantic
against
the
wall
who
would
think
he
said
sarcastically
that
a
mere
elegant
in
its
day
could
make
more
hostility
than
an
idle
head
i
will
tell
you
the
silly
secret
of
it
when
i
came
from
the
obscurity
of
the
forest
sensitive
and
anxious
to
make
my
way
and
slowly
gathered
capital
and
knowledge
a
person
in
new
york
directed
a
letter
of
inquiry
to
me
it
told
how
a
certain
milburn
a
puritan
or
english
commonwealth
man
had
risen
to
great
distinction
in
that
province
and
had
revolutionized
its
government
and
suffered
the
penalty
of
true
enough
said
judge
custis
pouring
a
second
glass
of
brandy
milburn
and
leisler
were
executed
in
new
york
during
the
lifetime
of
the
first
custis
they
anticipated
the
expulsion
of
james
and
were
entrapped
by
their
provincial
enemies
and
made
political
martyrs
the
inquirer
said
meshach
who
had
obtained
my
address
in
the
course
of
business
related
that
after
milburn
death
his
brethren
and
their
families
had
sailed
to
the
chesapeake
where
the
protestants
had
successfully
revolutionized
for
king
william
and
making
choice
of
poor
lands
they
had
become
obscure
he
asked
me
if
the
records
made
any
registry
of
their
wills
of
course
you
found
them
yes
it
was
a
revelation
to
me
and
gave
me
the
honorable
sense
of
some
origin
and
quality
i
traced
myself
back
to
the
earliest
folios
at
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
any
property
milburn
asked
the
judge
voluptuous
and
reanimated
again
my
had
left
his
son
nothing
but
a
hat
not
uncommon
exclaimed
judge
custis
our
early
wills
contain
little
but
legacies
of
wearing
apparel
household
articles
bedding
pots
and
kettles
and
the
elements
of
civilization
the
will
on
record
said
give
to
my
eldest
son
meshach
milburn
my
best
hat
and
no
more
of
my
ha
ha
ha
laughed
the
judge
loudly
genteel
to
the
last
a
hat
of
fashion
no
doubt
made
in
london
quite
too
ceremonious
and
topgallant
for
these
colonies
he
left
it
to
his
eldest
son
we
may
say
ho
ho
when
my
indignation
was
over
i
took
the
same
view
you
do
judge
custis
that
it
was
a
bequest
of
dignity
not
of
burlesque
and
i
made
some
inquiries
for
that
best
hat
it
was
a
legend
among
my
forest
kin
had
been
seen
by
very
old
people
was
celebrated
in
its
day
and
worn
by
my
grandfather
thankfully
he
left
it
to
my
father
still
a
hat
of
reputation
still
to
the
oldest
son
ha
ha
milburn
my
father
sold
the
hat
to
charles
wilson
peale
who
was
native
to
our
peninsula
and
knew
the
ancient
things
existing
here
that
would
help
him
to
form
peale
museum
during
the
last
century
i
found
the
hat
in
that
museum
covering
the
of
guy
fawkes
conspirator
hat
bravo
exclaimed
the
judge
it
had
been
used
for
the
heads
of
george
calvert
and
shakespeare
but
in
time
of
religious
excitements
was
proclaimed
to
be
the
true
hat
of
guy
fawkes
i
reclaimed
it
and
brought
it
to
princess
anne
and
in
a
vain
moment
put
it
on
my
head
and
walked
into
the
street
it
was
assailed
with
halloos
and
ribaldry
it
was
another
shirt
of
nessus
milburn
it
poisoned
your
life
eh
perhaps
so
replied
milburn
with
intensity
they
say
what
is
one
man
drink
is
another
man
poison
you
will
accept
that
hat
on
the
head
of
your
or
no
more
out
of
the
custis
property
chapter
the
tract
resolution
of
character
and
executive
power
had
been
trifled
away
by
judge
custis
the
trader
had
concluded
their
interview
with
a
decision
and
fierceness
that
left
paralysis
upon
the
gentleman
mind
he
saw
in
sad
fancy
the
execution
served
upon
his
furniture
the
amazement
of
his
wife
the
pallor
of
his
daughter
the
indignation
of
his
sons
he
also
shrank
before
the
impending
failure
of
his
furnace
and
abandonment
of
the
tract
on
which
he
had
raised
so
much
state
and
local
fame
people
would
say
custis
was
a
fool
and
deceived
himself
while
old
milburn
played
upon
the
custises
vanity
and
turned
them
into
the
street
no
doubt
thought
the
judge
that
fellow
milburn
can
get
anything
when
he
gets
my
house
the
poor
folks
vote
he
may
command
because
he
is
of
their
class
he
is
a
lender
to
many
of
the
rich
who
could
have
suspected
his
intelligence
his
address
too
he
handled
me
as
if
i
were
a
forester
and
he
a
judge
a
very
very
remarkable
man
finished
judge
custis
taking
the
last
of
the
brandy
he
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of

where
your

asked
the

where

him
there
let
the
bilious
sweat
from

strong
that
like
judas
of
old
his
bowels
may
drop

but

the
irresolute
man
i
have
no
right
to
hate

judge
softly
said
the
old
negro

a
very

exclaimed
the
judge
on
the
male
side
of
marriage
contracts
it
always
assumed
and
never
expected
you
need
not
remember
samson
that
i
expressed

judge
is
to

i
wish

no

god

the
negro
said
an
humble
and
the
judge
lay
down
upon
his
bed
to
think
of
the
dread
alternatives
of
the
coming
week
but
voluptuous
even
in
despair
he
slept
before
he
had
come
to
any
conclusion
samson
hat
walked
up
the
side
of
the
on
a
sandy
road
divided
from
the
water
by
a
dense
growth
of
pines
the
bullfrogs
and
insects
serenaded
the
forest
the
furnace
chimney
smoked
lurid
on
the
midnight
at
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
or
more
an
old
cabin
in
decay
stood
in
a
sandy
field
near
the
road
it
had
no
door
in
the
hollow
doorway
no
sash
in
the
one
gaping
window
the
step
was
broken
leading
to
the
sill
and
some
of
the
had
rotted
from
the
skeleton
the
old
bore
it
toughly
up
however
and
the
low
brick
props
under
the
corners
stood
plumb
within
lay
a
single
room
with
open
beams
a
sort
of
cupboard
stairway
projecting
over
the
fireplace
and
another
door
and
window
were
in
the
rear
before
this
fireplace
sat
meshach
milburn
on
an
old
chair
fairly
revealed
by
the
light
of
some
of
the
burning
he
had
thrown
upon
the
hearth
on
the
hearth
was
a
little
heap
of
the
bog
iron
ore
and
a
bottle
come
in
samson
he
called

think
me
turned
drunkard
because
i
am
taking
this
whiskey
i
drink
it
to
keep

the
malaria
and
partly
as
a

cup
for
the
barefooted

in

said
the
go
up
into
the
loft
and
sleep
till
you
are
called
i
want
the
horses
early
for
princess
anne
the
negro
obeyed
without
remark
and
disappeared
behind
the
door
milburn
sat
before
the
fire
and
looked
into
it
long
while
a
procession
of
thoughts
and
phantoms
passed
before
it
he
saw
a
poor
family
of
independent
puritans
setting
sail
at
different
dates
from
english
seaports
some
were
indentured
servants
hoping
for
a
career
others
were
avoiding
the
civil
wars
others
were
small
political
malefactors
noisy
against
the
oppressions
of
their
hero
cromwell
and
conspirators
against
his
power
and
thrown
by
him
in
english
jails
were
only
delivered
to
be
sold
into
slavery
driven
through
the
streets
of
placed
on
troop
ships
between
the
decks
among
the
horses
and
set
up
at
auction
in
barbadoes
like
the
blacks
whence
they
in
time
continued
onward
westward
one
the
fortunate
possessor
of
some
competence
sailed
his
own
ship
across
the
atlantic
and
delivered
up
to
massachusetts
her
governor
and
gentry
another
incapable
of
being
suppressed
though
a
servant
seized
the
destinies
of
an
aristocratic
colony
and
held
them
for
a
while
until
accumulating
enemies
bore
him
down
and
wedlock
and
the
gibbet
followed
close
together
poverty
would
not
relinquish
its
gripe
upon
the
race
they
struggled
up
like
clods
upon
the
ploughshare
and
fell
back
again
into
the
furrow
as
meshach
milburn
thought
of
these
things
he
took
up
a
portion
of
the
bog
ore
from
the
hearth
here
is
iron
he
said
thoughtfully
true
iron
which
makes
the
blood
red
moulds
into
infinite
forms
nails
houses
together
binds
wheels
and
casts
into
cannon
and
ball
but
this
iron
ran
into
a
bog
formed
low
combinations
and
had
no
other
mould
than
twigs
and
leaves
afforded
its
volcanic
origin
was
forgotten
when
it
ran
with
sand
and
gravel
away
from
the
mountain
vein
and
upland
ore
along
the
low
alluvial
bar
till
like
an
oyster
the
iron
is
dredged
from
the
stagnant
pool
impure
inefficacious
corrupted
so
is
it
with
man
whose
magnetic
spirit
follows
the
dull
declivity
to
the
barren
sandbars
of
the
world
and
lodges
there
i
am
of
the
bog
ores
but
that
exists
which
will
flux
with
me
clean
me
of
rust
and
transmit
my
better
quality
to
posterity
o
youth
beauty
and
station
lovely
vesta
for
thee
i
will
be
iron
milburn
looked
around
the
single
room
inquiringly
he
placed
his
finger
upon
the
crevices
in
the
he
opened
the
little
closet
below
the
stairs
and
a
weasel
dashed
out
and
shot
through
the
door
he
ascended
the
steep
short
stairs
and
with
a
torch
examined
the
black
shingles
but
nothing
was
there
except
a
litter
of
young
owls
whose
parents
had
gone
poaching
then
returning
he
searched
on
every
open
beam
and
rotting
board
as
if
for
writing
they
could
not
write
he
thought
nothing
is
left
to
me
not
even
a
sign
down
a
century
and
a
half
to
tell
that
i
had
parents
as
he
spoke
he
felt
an
object
move
behind
him
and
looking
back
the
shadow
of
the
entailed
hat
was
dancing
on
the
wall
as
he
threw
his
head
back
so
did
it
as
he
retired
from
it
the
hat
enlarged
until
the
little
room
could
hardly
hold
its
shadow
retiring
again
he
lifted
it
from
his
head
with
bitter
courtesy
and
the
shadow
did
the
same
the
man
and
the
shadow
looked
each
at
a
peaked
hat
and
stroked
it
this
is
everything
exclaimed
milburn
the
hundred
humble
heads
are
at
rest
in
the
sand
one
would
mock
them
all
but
once
the
family
brain
expanded
to
a
hat
and
that
survived
the
race
i
am
the
quaker
who
respects
his
hat
the
cardinal
who
is
crowned
with
it
yes
and
the
dunce
who
must
wear
it
in
his
corner
then
the
picture
of
his
parents
arose
upon
his
sight
a
cheerful
father
with
two
or
three
old
slaves
ploughing
in
the
deep
sand
to
drop
some
shrivelled
grains
of
corn
or
tinkering
a
disordered
that
moved
a
blacksmith
saw
ever
full
of
confidence
in
nothing
which
could
increase
credulous
and
sanguine
tender
and
laborious
milburn
sire
nursed
his
forest
patches
as
if
they
were
presently
to
be
rich
plantations
and
was
ever
pricing
negroes
mules
tools
and
implements
in
expectation
of
buying
them
nothing
could
diminish
his
confidence
but
disease
and
old
age
he
heard
of
the
great
improvement
on
the
furnace
tract
and
took
his
obedient
wife
and
brood
there
as
the
laborers
pulled
out
the
tussocks
and
roots
encrusted
with
iron
from
the
swamp
and
creek
fever
and
ague
came
forth
and
smote
them
both
how
wretched
that
scene
when
almost
too
haggard
to
move
father
and
mother
in
this
one
bare
room
where
meshach
sat
groaning
amid
their
many
offspring
saw
death
with
weakness
creep
upon
each
other
death
without
priest
or
doctor
without
residue
or
cleanliness
the
death
the
million
die
in
lowly
huts
yet
oh
how
hard
haste
sonny
boy
the
frightened
father
had
said
knowing
not
how
ill
he
was
in
his
dependence
on
his
wife
take
the
horse
and
ride
into
snow
hill
for
the
doctor
poor
mother
is
dreadful
sick
then
leaping
upon
the
lean
old
horse
and
with
a
rope
bridle
meshach
had
pushed
through
the
deep
sand
bareheaded
and
barefooted
and
almost
crazy
with
excitement
until
he
entered
the
shining
streets
of
the
sandhilled
town
and
sensitively
rushed
into
the
doctor
office
crying
daddy
and
mammy
is
sick
at
the
furnace
and
told
his
name
and
wheeled
and
fled
but
as
the
boy
rode
home
more
slowly
past
the
river
full
of
the
yellow
masts
of
vessels
rising
above
the
woods
the
flat
fields
of
corn
everywhere
bounded
by
forest
and
the
small
white
houses
of
the
better
farmers
and
at
last
entered
the
murmurous
complaining
woods
he
saw
but
one
thing
his
mother
was
she
to
disappear
from
the
lonely
clearing
and
leave
only
the
hut
and
its
orphans
she
who
kept
heaven
here
below
and
was
the
saints
the
arts
the
for
her
child
with
her
there
could
be
no
poverty
without
her
riches
would
be
only
more
sand
with
a
little
molasses
she
made
christmas
kingly
with
a
cake
she
could
name
a
little
chicken
meshach
and
every
egg
it
laid
was
a
new
toy
a
caught
in
the
swamp
became
one
of
the
family
by
her
kindness
would
it
ever
sing
again
the
religion
they
knew
was
all
of
her
the
poor
slaves
saw
no
difference
in
mistresses
while
she
was
theirs
in
sickness
she
was
in
her
sphere
health
itself
had
come
and
once
the
tenderest
thing
in
life
when
his
father
and
she
had
quarrelled
and
the
light
of
love
being
out
made
the
darkness
of
poverty
for
the
only
time
visible
meshach
saw
her
weeping
and
he
could
not
comfort
her
then
blinded
by
tears
he
lashed
his
nag
along
and
entered
the
low
door
she
was
dead
sonny
mammy
gone
the
wretched
father
groaned
the
little
children
huddling
about
the
form
lifted
their
wail
the
could
find
no
note
for
this
and
was
hushed
milburn
arose
the
fire
was
low
he
walked
to
the
door
and
there
was
a
sign
of
day
the
woods
of
pine
were
still
dark
but
on
the
sandy
road
and
some
light
was
shining
like
hopefulness
against
hope
the
farm
was
ploughed
no
more
the
ungrateful
centuries
were
left
behind
and
abandoned
like
old
wilderness
so
sterile
that
their
great
events
remain
ever
unvisited
ho
samson
boy
it
is
time
yes
marster
answered
the
negro
in
the
loft
as
the
negro
gathered
himself
up
and
passed
down
the
stairs
he
saw
meshach
milburn
before
the
fire
stirring
the
coals
passing
out
samson
stood
a
moment
at
the
gate
and
lounged
up
the
road
not
to
lose
his
master
as
he
stood
there
flames
burst
out
of
the
old
hut
and
glistened
on
the
evergreen
forest
lighting
the
tops
of
the
mossy
cypresses
in
the
and
revealing
the
forms
of
the
sandy
fields
before
he
could
start
back
samson
saw
his
master
figure
go
round
and
round
the
house
lighting
the
from
place
to
place
with
a
torch
and
then
the
low
figure
capped
with
the
long
hat
came
up
the
road
as
if
at
mighty
strides
so
lengthened
by
the
fire
no
need
of
alarm
boy
exclaimed
the
filial
incendiary
henceforth
my
only
ancestral
hall
is
he
held
the
ancient
tile
up
in
the
light
of
the
blaze
ah
marster
said
the
negro
yo
hat
will
never
give
comfort
like
a
home
fine
as
de
hat
may
be
mean
as
de
roof
de
hat
will
never
hold
two
heads
and
dat
makes
happiness
the
hat
at
least
answered
milburn
bitterly
will
cover
me
where
i
go
such
rotted
roofs
as
that
was
make
captives
of
bright
souls
they
looked
on
the
fire
in
silence
a
few
minutes
you
have
burnt
me
out
boss
said
old
samson
finally
i
ai
got
no
place
to
go
an
hide
when
i
fights
now
it
makes
me
feel
solemn
peace
replied
meshach
milburn
now
for
the
horses
and
princess
anne
chapter
vi
the
custises
ruined
vesta
custis
dressing
in
her
chamber
heard
early
wheels
upon
the
morning
air
and
looking
through
the
blinds
saw
a
double
team
coming
up
the
road
from
hardship
mother
she
said
is
that
father
coming
yonder
no
it
is
not
his
driver
why
vesta
exclaimed
custis
that
is
old
milburn
man
samson
hat
so
it
is
what
is
he
doing
with
two
horses
here
vesta
laughed
aloud
and
began
to
skip
about
in
her
long
slender
worked
slippers
whose
insteps
would
spare
a
mouse
darting
under
mamma
it
is
milburn
himself
in
a
hack
and
span
see
there
the
hat
copper
buckle
and
all
is
he
too
funny
for
anything
but
dear
me
he
is
staring
right
up
at
this
window
let
us
duck
vesta
long
arms
divided
from
her
beautiful
shoulders
only
by
a
spray
of
lace
pulled
her
mother
down
do
be
afraid
dear
he
can
see
nothing
but
the
blinds
perhaps
he
is
looking
for
the
judge
vesta
rose
again
in
her
white
like
a
stag
rising
from
a
a
long
trembling
movement
the
result
of
tittering
passed
down
the
graceful
column
of
her
back
he
sits
there
like
an
indian
riding
past
in
a
show
mamma
did
you
ever
see
such
a
hat
i
think
it
must
be
buggy
by
this
time
said
the
mother
and
both
of
them
shook
with
laughter
again
unless
added
custis
the
bugs
are
starved
out
poor
lonely
creature
said
vesta
he
can
only
wear
such
a
hat
from
want
of
understanding
his
is
good
enough
dear
he
has
the
green
gaiters
on
they
laughed
again
and
vesta
hair
shaken
down
by
her
merriment
fell
nearly
to
her
slipper
like
the
skin
of
some
beast
that
had
sprung
down
a
poplar
trunk
ah
well
exclaimed
vesta
as
her
maid
entered
and
proceeded
to
wind
up
this
satin
cordage
on
her
crown
what
men
are
in
their
minds
can
woman
know
old
ladies
not
unfrequently
wear
their
old
bonnets
long
past
the
fashion
but
it
is
from
want
this
man
is
his
own
master
and
not
poor
his
companion
is
a
negro
and
his
taste
a
mouldy
hat
old
as
america
how
happy
are
we
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
pry
into
such
minds
a
little
refinement
is
the
next
blessing
to
religion
your
father
mind
is
a
puzzle
too
vesta
he
has
everything
which
these
foresters
lack
education
society
standing
and
comforts
but
he
returns
to
the
forest
like
an
opossum
the
moment
your
eye
is
off
him
he
ca
be
traced
up
like
this
man
by
his
hat
i
think
it
a
shame
on
you
particularly
if
he
do
come
home
this
day
i
shall
send
for
my
brother
and
force
an
account
of
my
property
from
judge
custis
the
wife
sat
down
and
began
to
cry
i
take
the
carriage
after
breakfast
mamma
and
seek
him
at
the
furnace
or
wherever
he
may
be
those
bog
ores
have
given
him
a
great
deal
of
trouble
i
wish
i
had
never
heard
of
bog
ore
exclaimed
custis
when
the
money
was
in
bank
there
was
no
ore
about
it
he

looking
like

magistrate
and
a
gentleman
he
always
comes
back
looking
like
a
and
a
drunkard
there
must
be
in
it
here
in
an
impulse
of
weak
rage
the
poor
lady
got
up
and
walked
to
her
mirror
and
looked
at
her
face
apparently
satisfied
that
such
charms
were
trampled
on
she
dried
her
tears
altogether
and
resumed
ginny
go
out
of
the
room
to
the
neat
mulatto
lass
vesta
my
dear
daughter
i
would
not
cast
a
stain
upon
you
for
the
world
but
flesh
and
blood
cry
out
if
your
father
do
do
better
i
will
separate
from
him
and
leave
princess
anne
why
the
daughter
bright
eyes
were
large
and
startled
now
and
their
tint
grew
plainer
under
her
rich
black
eyebrows
i
will
do
it
if
i
die
unless
he
reforms
why
mother
vesta
stood
with
her
lips
parted
and
her
beautiful
teeth
just
lacing
the
coral
of
the
lip
she
could
say
no
more
for
a
long
moment
rising
as
she
spoke
with
her
head
thrown
back
and
her
mould
the
fuller
and
a
pallor
in
her
cheeks
she
looked
the
eve
first
hearing
the
rebuke
a
separation
in
this
family
whispered
vesta
it
would
scandalize
all
maryland
it
would
break
my
heart
darling
daughter
my
heart
must
be
considered
sometimes
i
was
something
before
i
was
a
custis
i
am
a
woman
too
vesta
still
pale
crossed
to
her
mother
side
and
kissed
her
do
do
mamma
ever
harbor
a
thought
like
that
again
you
who
have
been
so
brave
and
patient
longer
than
i
have
lived
ah
vesta
it
is
the
length
of
injury
that
wears
us
out
what
if
something
should
happen
to
us
none
are
so
unfit
to
bear
poverty
as
we
we
can
not
be
poor
said
the
daughter
soothingly
do
you
remember
mother
where
it
says
thy
day
so
shall
thy
strength
be
my
child
custis
replied
your
day
is
young
life
looks
hopeful
to
you
i
am
growing
old
and
where
is
the
arm
on
which
i
should
be
leaning
what
are
we
but
two
women
left
there
is
another
passage
on
which
i
often
think
when
we
sit
so
often
alone
women
shall
be
grinding
at
the
mill
the
one
shall
be
taken
and
the
other
left
is
that
you
or
is
it
i
listen
my
child
it
is
time
that
you
should
feel
the
melancholy
truth
your
father
habits
have
mastered
him
he
is
beyond
reclamation
vesta
was
kneeling
and
she
slowly
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
her
mother
with
her
nostrils
dilated
custis
felt
uneasy
before
the
aroused
mind
of
her
child
do
look
at
me
so
vesta
the
poor
lady
pleaded
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
it
how
dare
you
say
that
of
my
father
of
judge
custis
as
they
were
in
this
suspense
of
feeling
wheels
were
heard
the
daughter
went
to
the
window
and
looked
down
and
then
returned
to
her
mother
ear
hush
mother
it
is
papa
now
wash
your
eyes
at
the
toilet
let
us
meet
him
cheerfully
never
say
again
that
he
is
beyond
reclamation
while
we
can
try
a
kiss
smoothed
custis
countenance
vesta
was
dressed
for
breakfast
in
a
few
moments
and
descended
to
the
library
and
was
received
in
her
father
arms
he
held
her
there
a
long
while
and
held
her
close
and
by
little
fits
renewed
his
embrace
but
she
felt
that
his
breath
was
feverish
and
his
arms
trembled
looking
up
at
him
she
saw
indeed
that
he
was
flushed
yet
haggard
and
careworn
vessy
he
spoke
with
a
feeble
attempt
to
smile
i
want
a
glass
of
brandy
mine
gave
out
at
the
furnace
and
the
morning
ride
has
weakened
me
where
is
the
key
she
looked
at
him
with
a
so
that
he
might
not
suspect
as
if
to
measure
his
need
of
stimulant
then
without
a
word
she
led
the
way
to
the
and
unlocked
the
liquor
closet
and
turned
her
back
lest
he
might
not
drink
his
need
from
sensitiveness
naughty
man
said
vesta
standing
off
and
looking
at
him
when
he
was
done
i
was
going
down
for
you
to
the
furnace
after
breakfast
we
will
have
no
more
of
this
truantry
mamma
and
i
have
set
our
feet
down
you
must
come
back
from
the
furnace
every
night
and
go
again
in
the
morning
like
other
business
men
be
very
kind
to
mamma
this
morning
sir
she
feels
your
neglect
vesta
had
already
rung
for
the
judge
valet
who
now
appeared
drew
off
his
boots
supplied
his
slippers
and
and
led
the
way
to
his
bath
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
reappeared
looking
better
and
he
irresolutely
turned
again
towards
the
smiling
suggestively
at
vesta
not
that
way
spoke
she
here
is
mamma
and
we
are
ready
for
prayers
here
is
the
place
in
the
bible
they
all
went
to
the
family
room
where
the
of
vesta
and
her
mother
were
waiting
for
the
usual
morning
prayers
vesta
placed
the
open
bible
on
her
father
knee
and
he
began
absently
and
stumblingly
to
read
it
was
in
the
book
of
samuel
and
seemed
to
be
some
old
jewish
mythology
he
suddenly
came
to
a
verse
which
arrested
his
sensibilities
by
its
pathos
david
sent
messengers
to
saul
son
saying
deliver
me
my
wife
michal
and
sent
and
took
her
from
her
husband
even
from
phaltiel
the
son
of
laish
and
her
husband
went
with
her
along
weeping
behind
her
then
said
abner
unto
him
go
return
and
he
returned
judge
custis
saw
at
once
the
picture
this
compact
history
aroused
the
inexorable
david
perhaps
had
married
another
love
occasion
had
arisen
to
embitter
her
kin
and
they
took
her
back
and
gave
her
in
happiness
to
her
pining
lover
but
again
the
man
of
correct
habits
triumphed
over
the
sons
of
the
king
and
despatched
abner
to
tear
his
wife
from
her
true
husband
arms
poor
phaltiel
followed
her
weeping
until
ordered
to
go
back
and
back
he
went
forever
desolate
the
scene
recalled
the
brutal
demand
of
his
creditor
upon
his
child
the
judge
eyes
silently
and
he
could
not
see
vesta
had
watched
him
closely
as
her
silent
magistracy
detected
a
great
anxiety
or
illness
in
her
father
lest
her
mother
might
also
notice
it
she
interposed
in
the
lesson
as
was
her
habit
by
reading
the
episcopal
form
of
prayer
in
which
they
all
bent
their
heads
once
or
twice
as
she
went
on
she
detected
a
suppressed
sob
especially
at
the
paragraph
thou
who
knowest
the
weakness
and
corruption
of
our
nature
and
the
manifold
temptations
which
we
daily
meet
with
we
humbly
beseech
thee
to
have
compassion
on
our
infirmities
and
to
give
us
the
constant
assistance
of
thy
holy
spirit
that
we
may
be
effectually
restrained
from
sin
and
excited
to
our
duty
they
went
to
the
and
the
judge
countenance
was
down
he
bit
off
some
toast
and
filled
his
mouth
with
tea
but
could
not
swallow
a
hand
softly
touched
his
elbow
and
looking
there
he
saw
a
full
of
brandy
softly
glide
to
the
spot
as
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
rich
yearning
face
of
his
daughter
tenderly
consulting
his
weakness
his
heart
burst
forth
he
leaned
his
head
upon
the
table
and
cried
between
drink
and
grief
darling
we
are
ruined
custis
at
once
arose
and
looked
frightenedly
at
the
judge
vesta
as
quickly
turned
to
the
servants
and
motioned
them
to
go
no
let
them
hear
it
raved
judge
custis
perceiving
the
motion
they
are
interested
like
us
they
must
be
sold
too
faithful
servants
perhaps
it
may
warn
them
to
escape
in
time
the
servants
bred
like
ladies
quietly
left
the
room
custis
growing
paler
exclaimed
daniel
custis
have
you
lost
everything
in
that
furnace
everything
and
my
money
too
yes
merciful
god
before
the
weak
lady
could
fall
vesta
arm
was
around
her
and
her
finger
on
the
servants
entered
and
custis
was
carried
out
her
daughter
following
when
vesta
returned
her
father
was
walking
up
and
down
the
floor
with
his
long
silk
handkerchief
in
both
hands
weeping
bitterly
and
speaking
broken
syllables
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
with
all
the
might
of
a
daughter
first
called
on
to
act
alone
in
a
great
crisis
the
feeling
she
was
wont
to
hold
towards
him
of
perfect
pride
had
received
a
blow
in
her
mother
expression
your
father
habits
have
mastered
him
beyond
reclamation
could
this
be
true
that
he
the
grand
the
kind
the
gentleman
was
beneath
the
diver
reach
the
plummet
sounding
where
light
could
not
pierce
nor
hope
overtake
father
the
first
gentleman
in
somerset
a
drunkard
going
ever
downward
towards
the
gutter
and
no
ray
of
heaven
to
beam
upon
his
grave
she
saw
his
danger
now
it
was
written
on
his
face
where
the
image
of
god
shone
dim
that
had
once
been
crowned
there
hair
thinner
and
very
gray
the
rich
dark
eyes
intimidated
as
if
manly
confidence
was
gone
the
skin
no
more
the
pure
scroll
of
regular
life
written
in
the
healthy
fluid
of
the
heart
but
faded
yet
spotted
with
alcohol
on
the
nose
and
lips
signs
of
coarser
sensuality
the
large
skeleton
bent
and
the
nervous
temperament
shattered
this
father
had
been
until
this
moment
vesta
angel
now
there
might
not
be
an
angel
in
the
universe
to
fly
to
his
rescue
deep
dreadful
humility
descended
into
the
spirit
god
forgive
me
she
thought
how
blind
and
how
proud
and
sinful
i
have
been
she
walked
over
to
her
father
tenderly
and
kissed
him
and
then
drawing
his
weaker
inclination
by
hers
brought
him
to
a
sofa
placed
a
pillow
for
him
and
made
him
stretch
his
once
proud
form
there
procuring
a
bowl
of
water
she
washed
his
face
free
of
tears
with
a
napkin
and
bathed
it
in
cologne
the
voluptuous
nature
of
the
judge
yielded
to
the
perfume
and
the
easy
position
and
he
sobbed
himself
to
sleep
like
an
exhausted
child
sitting
by
the
sleeping
bankrupt
watching
his
breast
rise
and
fall
and
hearing
his
coarse
snoring
as
if
fiends
within
were
snarling
in
rivalry
for
the
possession
of
him
vesta
felt
that
the
life
which
was
unconscious
there
was
the
fountain
of
her
own
and
loving
no
man
else
she
felt
her
heart
like
a
goldfish
of
that
fountain
go
around
and
around
it
throbbingly
then
first
arose
the
wish
often
in
woman
life
repeated
to
have
been
born
a
man
and
know
how
to
help
her
father
that
suggested
that
she
had
brothers
who
ought
to
be
summoned
and
confer
with
their
father
but
now
it
occurred
to
her
that
every
one
of
them
had
leaned
upon
him
and
though
conscious
that
it
was
wicked
vesta
felt
her
pride
rise
against
the
thought
that
any
being
outside
of
that
house
even
a
brother
should
know
of
its
disgrace
what
could
she
do
she
thought
of
all
her
jewels
her
riding
mare
her
watch
her
father
own
gifts
and
then
the
thought
perished
that
these
could
help
him
could
she
not
earn
something
by
her
voice
which
had
sung
to
such
praises
alas
that
voice
had
lost
the
ingredient
of
hope
and
she
feared
to
unclose
her
lips
lest
it
might
come
forth
in
agony
crying
god
have
mercy
i
have
nothing
said
vesta
to
herself
except
love
for
these
two
martyrs
my
father
and
mother
no
nothing
can
be
done
until
he
awakens
and
tells
me
the
worst
meantime
it
would
be
wicked
for
me
to
increase
the
agitation
already
here
and
where
i
must
be

custis
was
in
no
situation
to
give
annoyance
for
that
day
as
a
seized
her
and
she
kept
her
room
infirm
of
will
purely
social
in
her
marriage
relations
and
never
aiming
higher
than
respectability
she
missed
the
coarse
mark
of
her
husband
who
with
all
his
moral
defections
probably
was
her
moral
equal
his
vital
standard
higher
his
tone
a
genial
hypocrisy
and
at
bottom
he
was
a
democrat
custis
had
no
insight
nor
variability
of
charity
her
mind
bounded
by
the
municipal
republic
of
baltimore
which
esteems
itself
the
world
particularly
among
its
mercantile
aristocracy
who
live
like
the
old
venetian
nobility
among
their
flat
lagoons
and
do
commerce
chiefly
with
the
turk
in
the
more
torrid
and
instinctive
indies
and
south
amiable

afraid
of
new
ideas
frugal
of

if
hospitable
at
the

with
a

spiritedness
that
is
seldom
intellectual
but
a
beauty
that
powerfully
attracts
till
by
the
limited
sympathies
beneath
it
the
husband
from
the
outer
world
discerns
how
hopelessly
slavery
and
caste
sink
into
an
old
shipping
society
the
baltimore
that
ruled
the
chesapeake
had
no
more
perfected
product
than
custis
her
modesty
and
virtue
were
as
natural
as
her
prejudices
she
believed
that
marriage
was
the
close
of
female
ambition
and
marrying
her
children
was
the
only
innovation
to
be
permitted
certain
accomplishments
she
thought
due
to
woman
but
none
of
them
must
become
masculine
in
prosecution
a
professional
woman
she
shrank
from
as
from
an
infidel
or
an
abolitionist
reading
was
meritorious
up
to
an
orthodox
point
but
a
passion
for
new
books
was
dangerous
probably
irreligious
to
lose
one
money
was
a
crime
to
lose
another
money
the
unforgiven
sin
because
that
was
baltimore
public
opinion
which
she
thought
was
the
only
opinion
entitled
to
consideration
the
old
scotch
and
irish
merchants
there
had
made
it
the
law
that
enterprise
was
only
excusable
by
success
and
that
success
only
branded
an
innovator
a
good
standard
of
society
therefore
had
barely
permitted
judge
custis
to
take
up
the
manufacture
and
failing
in
it
his
wife
thought
he
was
no
better
than
a
jacobin
on
the
eastern
shore
where
society
was
formed
before
glasgow
and
belfast
had
colonized
upon
the
chesapeake
with
their
precise
formulas
of
life
a
gentler
benevolence
rose
and
descended
upon
the
ground
every
day
like
the
evaporations
of
those
prolific
seas
which
manure
the
thin
soil
unfailingly
religion
and
benevolence
were
depositions
rather
than
dogmas
there
moderate
poverty
was
the
not
unwelcome
expectation
wealth
a
subject
of
apprehensive
scruples
kindness
the
law
pride
the
exception
and
grinding
avarice
like
meshach
milburn
was
the
mark
of
the
devil
entering
into
the
neighbor
and
the
judge
custis
was
representative
of
his
neighbors
except
in
his
virginia
voluptuousness
his
neighbors
were
neither
prudes
nor
hypocrites
and
he
respected
them
more
than
the
arrogant
race
in
the
old
land
of
accomac
and
in
the
virginia
peninsulas
whose
traits
he
had
almost
lost
sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
last
of
the
cavalier
stock
was
his
daughter
vesta
from
him
it
had
nearly
departed
and
his
sense
of
moral
shortcomings
expanded
his
heart
and
made
him
tenderly
pious
to
his
kind
if
not
to
god
he
admired
new
business
modes
and
northern
intruders
and
ideas
feeling
that
perhaps
the
last
evidence
of
his
aristocracy
from
nature
was
a
chivalric
resignation
the
were
saying
to
him
ye
shall
go
like
the
indians
but
be
not
inhospitable
to
your
successors
and
leave
them
your
benediction
that
the
great
bay
and
its
rivers
may
be
splendid
with
ships
and
men
though
ye
are
perished
forever
a
perception
of
the
energy
of
his
countrymen
and
a
pride
in
it
without
any
mean
reservation
though
it
might
involve
his
personal
humiliation
was
judge
custis
only
remaining
claim
to
magnanimity
still
rich
in
human
nature
he
was
beloved
by
his
daughter
with
all
her
soul
he
awoke
long
after
noon
in
body
refreshed
and
a
glass
of
milk
and
a
plover
broiled
on
toast
were
ready
for
him
to
eat
with
some
sprigs
of
new
celery
from
the
garden
to
feed
his
nerves
he
made
this
small
meal
silently
and
vesta
said
as
the
tray
was
removed
now
papa
before
we
leave
this
room
you
are
to
tell
me
the
whole
injury
you
have
suffered
and
what
all
of
us
can
do
to
assist
you
for
if
you
had
succeeded
the
reward
would
have
been
ours
and
we
must
divide
the
pains
of
your
misfortune
with
you
without
any
regret
courage
papa
and
let
me
understand
it
the
judge
feebly
looked
at
vesta
then
searched
his
mind
with
his
eyes
downcast
and
finally
spoke
my
child
i
am
the
victim
of
good
intentions
and
i
am
less
than
a
scoundrel
and
worse
than
a
fool
i
am
a
fraud
and
you
must
be
made
to
see
it
for
i
fear
you
have
been
proud
of
me
oh
father
i
have
said
vesta
with
an
instant
convulsion
you
were
my
god
let
us
throw
away
idolatry
my
darling
it
is
the
first
of
all
the
sins
how
loud
speaks
the
first
commandment
to
us
this
moment
shalt
have
no
other
gods
before
me
i
have
broken
it
sobbed
vesta
i
loved
you
more
than
my
creator
vesta
spoke
the
judge
you
are
the
only
thing
of
value
in
all
my
house
the
work
of
nature
in
you
is
all
that
survives
the
long
edifice
of
our
pride
the
treasure
of
your
beauty
and
love
still
makes
me
rich
to
thieves
who
lie
in
ambush
all
around
us
we
are
in
danger
we
are
pursued
o
god
pity
pity
the
pure
in
heart
as
the
judge
under
his
strong
earnestness
so
rare
in
him
of
late
threw
wide
his
arms
and
raised
his
brow
in
agony
vesta
felt
her
idolatry
come
back
he
was
so
grand
standing
there
in
his
unaffected
pain
and
helplessness
that
he
seemed
to
her
some
manly
prometheus
who
had
worked
with
fire
and
iron
to
the
exasperation
of
the
jealous
gods
admiration
dried
her
tears
and
she
forgot
her
father
references
to
herself
what
is
iron
she
asked
tell
me
why
you
wanted
to
make
iron
if
i
can
enter
into
your
mind
and
sympathize
with
the
hopes
you
have
had
it
will
lift
my
soul
from
the
ground
papa
i
should
have
asked
for
this
lesson
long
ago
the
judge
strode
up
and
down
till
she
repeated
the
question
and
had
brought
him
to
his
seat
he
collected
his
thoughts
and
resumed
his
worldly
tone
as
he
proceeded
with
his
old
cavalier
volatility
to
tell
the
tale
of
iron
i
have
duplicated
loans
he
said
at
last
on
the
same
properties
incurring
i
fear
a
stigma
upon
my
family
and
character
as
well
as
the
ruin
of
our
fortune
vesta
arose
with
pale
lips
and
a
sinking
heart
oh
father
she
whispered
in
a
frightened
tone
who
knows
this
terrible
secret
only
one
man
said
the
judge
cowering
down
to
the
carpet
with
his
courage
and
volatility
immediately
gone
old
meshach
milburn
knows
it
all
he
has
purchased
the
duplicate
notes
of
protest
and
holds
them
with
his
own
he
has
me
in
his
power
and
hates
me
he
will
expose
me
unless
i
submit
to
an
awful
condition
what
is
it
father
the
judge
looked
up
in
terror
and
meeting
vesta
pale
but
steady
gaze
hid
his
face
and
groaned
oh
it
is
too
disgraceful
to
tell
it
will
break
your
mother
heart
tell
me
at
once
exclaimed
vesta
in
a
low
and
hollow
tone
what
further
disgrace
can
this
monster
inflict
upon
us
than
to
expose
our
dishonor
can
he
kill
us
more
than
that
i
know
not
how
to
tell
you
vessy
spare
me
my
darling
my
face
i
hide
for
shame
there
was
a
pause
while
vesta
with
her
mind
expanded
to
touch
every
point
of
suggestion
stood
looking
down
at
her
father
yet
hardly
seeing
him
he
did
not
move
vesta
stooped
and
raised
her
father
face
to
find
some
solution
of
his
mysterious
evasion
he
shut
his
eyes
as
if
she
burned
him
with
her
wondering
look
papa
look
at
me
this
instant
you
shall
not
be
a
coward
to
me
he
broke
from
her
hands
and
retreated
to
a
window
looking
at
her
but
with
a
timorous
countenance
i
wish
you
to
go
this
moment
and
find
your
creditor
milburn
and
bring
him
to
me
you
must
obey
me
sir
the
father
raised
his
hands
as
if
to
protest
but
before
he
could
speak
a
shadow
fell
upon
the
window
and
the
figure
of
a
small
swarthy
man
covered
with
a
hat
advanced
up
the
front
steps
saviour
have
mercy
murmured
judge
custis
the
wolf
is
at
the
door
vesta
took
her
father
in
her
arms
and
kissed
him
once
assuringly
papa
go
send
a
servant
to
open
the
door
have
milburn
shown
into
this
room
to
await
me
do
you
go
and
engage
my
mother
affectionately
and
both
of
you
remain
in
your
chamber
till
i
am
ready
to
call
you
the
proximity
of
the
dreadful
creditor
had
almost
paralyzed
judge
custis
and
he
glided

among

his

informing
him
of
what
was
in
the
air
like
any
silken
terrier
and
yet
with
a
pallor
of
the
skin
as
of

the

with

and

mr

spoke
jimmy
loud
and
careless
phoebus
gentlemen
as
he
responded
with
a
voice
hardly
genial
but
placating
milburn
lifted
his
ancient
and
formidable
hat
and
in
an
instant
seemed
to
come
a
century
nearer
to
his
neighbors
his
stature
was
reduced
his
unsociableness
seemed
modified
he
now
looked
to
be
a
smallish
friendless
person
as
if
some
ownerless
dog
had
darted
through
the
street
and
heard
a
kind
chirp
at
the
tavern
door
where
his
reception
had
been

voice
with

little
tremor
in
it
emboldened
levin

this

mr
milburn
meshach
bowed
his
head
gliding
along
as
if
bashfully
anxious
to
pass
nice
weather
for
drivin
added
jack
wonnell
having
also
taken
off
his
own
tile
of
frivolity
to
feel
the
effect
but
this
remark
was
regarded
by
the
group
as
too
forward
and
a
low
chorus
ran
round
of
jack
wonnell
ca
help
bein
a
fool
to
save
his
life
milburn
said
to
himself
passing
on
are
those
voices
kinder
than
usually
or
am
i
more
timid
what
is
it
in
the
air
that
makes
everything
so
acute
and
my
cheeks
to
tingle
am
i
sick
or
is
it
love
the
word
frightened
him
and
the
sand
under
his
feet
seemed
to
crack
a
woodpecker
in
an
old
tree
tapped
as
if
it
was
the
tree
old
heart
quickened
by
something
the
houses
all
around
looked
like
live
objects
with
their
windows
fixed
upon
his
walk
like
married
folks
eyes
as
he
came
in
sight
of
judge
custis
residence
so
expressive
of
old
respect
and
long
intentions
the
almost
stopped
so
mild
and
peacefully
it
looked
at
him
so
undisturbed
while
he
was
palpitating
why
this
pain
thought
milburn
am
i
afraid
that
house
is
mine
do
i
fear
to
enter
my
own
and
yet
it
does
not
fear
me
it
has
been
there
so
long
that
it
has
no
fears
and
every
window
in
it
faces
benignant
to
my
coming
the
three
gables
survey
yonder
forest
landscape
like
three
old
magistrates
on
the
bench
administering
justice
to
a
county
where
never
till
now
was
there
a
ravisher
the
thought
produced
a
moment
intellectual
pride
in
him
like
lawless
power
uneasy
paroxysm
it
is
the
forest
these
gentles
have
to
fear
he
thought
resentfully
then
stopped
with
another
image
his
word
aroused
what
has
that
forest
ever
felt
of
injury
or
hate
with
every
unlatched
no
robber
feared
by
any
there
the
blossoms
on
the
peachtree
the
ripe
persimmons
on
the
roadside
plenteous
to
every
forester
child
and
humility
and
affection
making
all
richer
without
a
dollar
in
the
world
than
i
the
richest
upstart
of
the
forest
compelled
to
buy
affection
like
an
indifferent
slave
a
large
dog
at
custis
home
seeing
him
walk
so
slowly
came
down
the
path
to
the
gate
also
walking
slow
and
showed
neither
animosity
nor
interest
except
mechanically
to
walk
behind
him
towards
the
door
the
dog
knows
me
thought
the
quickened
heart
of
meshach
from
seeing
of
me
but
never
wagged
his
tail
at
me
in
all
that
time
could
i
acquire
the
heart
even
of
this
dog
though
i
might
buy
him
my
debtor
step
would
still
be
most
welcome
to
him
and
he
would
eat
my
food
in
strangeness
and
fear
milburn
walked
up
the
steps
and
sounded
the
substantial
brass
knocker
it
struck
four
times
loud
and
deep
and
the
stillness
that
followed
was
louder
yet
like
the
unknown
thing
after
sentence
has
been
passed
he
seemed
to
be
there
a
very
long
time
with
his
heart
quite
vacant
as
if
the
debtor
knocker
had
scared
every
chatterer
out
of
it
and
yet
his
temples
and
ears
were
ringing
he
was
thinking
of
sounding
the
knocker
again
when
a
lady
servant
partly
white
rolled
back
the
bolt
and
bowed
to
his
question
whether
the
judge
was
in
he
entered
the
broad
hall
of
that
distinguished
residence
and
taking
the
entailed
hat
from
his
head
hung
it
up
at
last
where
better
had
been
wont
to
keep
equal
society
on
a
carved
mahogany
rack
of
colonial
times
the
venerable
object
once
there
gave
a
common
look
to
everything
as
meshach
thought
and
deepened
his
personal
sense
of
unworthiness
he
tried
to
feel
angry
but
apprehension
was
too
strong
for
passion
even
to
be
simulated
o
discriminating
god
he
felt
within
is
it
not
enough
to
create
us
so
unequal
that
we
must
also
cringe
in
spirit
and
acknowledge
it
i
expected
to
feel
triumphant
when
i
lodged
my
despised
hat
in
this
house
but
i
feel
meaner
than
before
the
room
whose
door
was
opened
by
the
lady
maid
was
the
library
containing
three
cumbrous
cases
of
books
and
several
portraits
in
oil
with
deep
gilded
frames
a
map
of
virginia
and
its
northeastern
environs
including
all
the
peninsula
south
of
the
choptank
river
and
cape
henlopen
and
near
the
door
was
a
tall
clock
that
a
giant
might
stand
in
solemnly
cogging
and
waving
time
and
giving
the
monotony
of
everlasting
evening
to
the
place
which
was
increased
by
the
flickering
fire
of
wood
on
the
tall
brass
before
which
some
wide
comfortable
leather
chairs
were
drawn
all
worn
to
luxurious
attitudes
as
if
each
had
been
the
skin
of
judge
custis
and
his
companions
recently
evacuated
a
woman
was
disposed
among
them
as
though
every
other
chair
deferred
to
it
this
was
the
first
article
to
arrest
attention
so
different
so
suggestive
almost
a
thing
of
superstition
poised
like
a
woman
instinct
and
will
upon
nothing
firm
yet
like
the
sphere
it
moved
upon
traversing
a
greater
arc
than
a
giant
seat
would
fill
purity
and
conquest
power
and
welcome
seemed
to
abide
within
it
like
the
empty
throne
in
parliament
milburn
being
left
alone
touched
the
fairy
rocker
with
his
foot
it
started
so
easily
and
so
gracefully
that
when
it
died
away
he
pressed
his
lips
to
the
top
of
it
nearest
where
her
neck
would
be
and
whispered
aloud
with
feeling
god
knows
that
kiss
at
least
was
pure
he
looked
at
the
portraits
and
though
they
were
not
inscribed
he
guessed
at
them
all
right
or
wrong
from
the
insight
of
local
lore
or
envious
interpretation
yon
saucy
greedy
superserviceable
rogue
thought
meshach
with
wine
and
beef
in
his
cheeks
and
silver
and
harlotry
in
his
eye
was
the
irish
of
rotterdam
who
kept
a
heavy
score
against
the
banished
princes
whom
cromwell
name
ever
made
to
swear
and
shiver
and
they
paid
him
in
a
distant
office
in
accomac
where
they
might
never
see
him
and
his
bills
again
and
there
they
let
him
steal
most
of
the
revenue
and
of
course
his
loyalty
was
in
proportion
to
his
booty
many
a
time
no
doubt
he
was
procurer
for
both
royal
brothers
charles
and
james
making
his
tavern
their
stew
with
betty
killigrew
or
lucy
walters
or
katy
peg
or
even
anne
hyde
the
mother
of
a
queen
of
her
who
was
the
princess
anne
godmother
of
our
worshipful
town
here
i
have
not
read
in
vain
concluded
meshach
because
my
noble
townsmen
drove
me
to
my
cell
the
next
portrait
was
clothed
in
military
uniform
with
a
higher
type
of
manhood
shrewd
and
vigilant
but
magisterial
that
should
be
john
custis
thought
milburn
looking
at
it
son
of
john
the
tapster
and
a
marrying
shifty
fellow
who
first
began
greatness
as
a
on
these
ocean
islands
till
his
father
friend
charles
in
a
merry
mood
made
henry
bennet
the
king
bastard
earl
of
arlington
and
lessee
of
virginia
all
the
province
for
forty
shillings
a
year
rent
those
were
pure
economical
times
indeed
around
the
court
so
john
flunkeyed
to
arlington
overseers
named
his
farm
hunted
and
informed
upon
the
followers
of
the
puritan
rebel
bacon
then
turned
and
fawned
upon
king
william
too
his
grandchildren
all
well
provided
for
spread
around
this
bay
so
much
for
politics
in
a
merchant
hands
the
tone
of
meshach
comment
had
somewhat
raised
his
courage
and
a
sense
of
pleasurable
interest
in
the
warm
room
and
genial
surroundings
led
him
to
pass
the
time
which
was
of
considerable
length
quite
contentedly
till
judge
custis
was
ready
meanwhile
the
hat
was
giving
some
silent
astonishment
to
the

carried
the
wondrous
information
to
the
colonnade
that
the
dreadful
creditor
had
come
and
roxy
the
table
waiter
had
carried
it
from
the

to

the
common
calamity
immediately
produced
a
revolution
against

threw
the

on
the
blistered
bulk
of

and
retreated
towards
the
big
black
fireplace
with
a
face
expressive
of
so
much
fright
and
cunning
humor
together
that
it
seemed
about
to
turn

the

both

considerably
and
the
group
of
little
colored
boys
and
girls
still
more
who
came
up
almost
chilled
with
terror
to
listen
but
it
produced
the
greatest
effect
on
aunt
hominy
herself
whose
imagination
widened
in
the
effort
excited
all
her
own
fears
and
gave
irresistible
vividness
to
her
legend
how
can
his
hat
measure
people
lands
in
aunty
asked
virgie
drawing
roxy
to
her
by
the
waist
for
their
mutual
protection
why

the

their

wide

the

heard
with
faith
only
less
than

but
aunt
hominy
spoke
roxy
he

and
all

a
doin

whispered
aunt
hominy
stooping
as
if
to
creep
in
the
contraction
of
her
own
fears
and
looking
up
into
their
faces
with
her
fists
clinched
he
a
ben
comin
along
de
fence
on
de
darkest
cloudiest
nights
dis
long
a
time
like
a
man
dat
was
goin

and
peepin
up
at

he

one

ever

well
exclaimed
roxy
after
a
pause
i
know
i
would
take
hold
of
that
hat
now
i
am
almost
afraid
to
look
at
it
said
virgie
but
if
miss
vessy
told
me
to
go
bring
it
to
her
i
would
do
it
le
us
all
go
together
ventured
aunt
hominy
and
take
a
peep
at
it
maybe
it
wo
hurt
us
if
we
all
go
aware
that
judge
custis
and
his
wife
were
not
near
the
little
circle
of
servants
aunt
hominy
virgie
roxy
and
the
four
children
from
five
to
fourteen
years
of
age
filed
softly
from
the
kitchen
through
the
covered
colonnade
and
thence
along
the
back
passage
to
the
end
of
the
hall
where
they
made
a
group
gazing
with
believing
wonder
at
the
king
james
tile
vesta
custis
having
changed
her
morning
robe
for
a
and
slightly
rearranged
her
toilet
and
knelt
speechless
awhile
to
receive
the
unknown
will
of
heaven
came
down
the
stairs
at
last
in
time
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
servants
staring
at
a
strange
old
hat
on
the
hall
rack
they
hastily
fled
at
her
appearance
but
the
idea
of
the
hat
was
also
conveyed
to
her
own
fancy
by
their
unwonted
behavior
she
looked
up
an
instant
at
the
queer
faded
article
hanging
among
its
betters
and
with
a
reminiscence
of
childhood
and
of
having
held
it
in
her
hand
there
descended
along
the
intervening
years
upon
the
association
the
odor
of
a
rose
and
the
impression
of
a
pair
of
bold
startled
eyes
gazing
into
hers
she
opened
the
library
door
and
the
same
eyes
were
looking
up
from
her
father
milburn
i
believe
said
vesta
walking
to
the
visitor
and
extending
her
hand
with
native
sweetness
he
arose
and
bowed
and
hardly
saw
the
hand
in
the
earnest
look
he
gave
her
as
if
she
had
surprised
him
and
he
did
not
know
how
to
express
his
bashfulness
she
did
not
withdraw
the
hand
till
he
took
it
and
then
he
did
not
let
it
go
his
strong
rather
than
bold
look
continuing
she
dropped
her
eyes
to
the
hand
that
mildly
held
her
own
and
then
she
observed
all
calm
as
she
was
that
his
hand
was
a
gentleman
its
fingers
long
and
almost
delicate
the
texture
white
the
palm
warm
and
as
it
seemed
to
her
of
something
like
a
brotherly
pressure
respectful
and
gentle
too
as
he
did
not
speak
immediately
vesta
returned
to
his
face
far
less
inviting
but
peculiar
the
black
hair
straight
the
high
no
real
beard
upon
him
anywhere
the
shape
of
the
face
broad
and
powerful
and
the
chops
long
while
the
eyes
wide
open
and
intense
answered
to
the
open
almost
observant
nostrils
at
the
end
of
his
straight
fine
nose
his
complexion
was
dark
and
seeming
to
show
a
poor
unnutritious
diet
he
was
hardly
taller
than
vesta
his
teeth
were
good
and
the
mouth
rather
small
she
thought
he
was
uncertain
what
to
say
or
confused
in
his
mind
though
no
sign
of
fear
was
visible
vesta
came
to
his
rescue
withdrawing
her
hand
naturally
i
have
seen
you
many
times
milburn
but
never
here
i
think
no
miss
i
have
never
been
here
he
hesitated
nor
anywhere
in
princess
anne
you
are
the
first
lady
here
to
speak
to
me
his
words
but
not
his
tone
intimated
an
inferiority
or
a
slight
the
voice
was
a
little
stiff
appearing
to
be
at
want
for
some
corresponding
inflection
like
a
man
who
had
learned
a
language
without
having
had
the
use
of
it
will
you
sit
milburn
you
owe
this
visit
so
long
that
you
will
not
be
in
haste
i
hope
you
have
not
felt
that
we
were
inhospitable
but
little
towns
often
encourage
narrow
circles
and
make
people
more
selfish
than
they
intend
you
could
never
be
selfish
miss
said
milburn
without
any
of
the
suavity
of
a
compliment
still
carrying
that
wild
regarding
gaze
like
the
eyes
of
a
startled
ox
vesta
faintly
colored
at
the
liberty
he
took
it
was
slightly
embarrassing
to
her
too
to
meet
that
uninterpretable
look
of
inquiry
and
homage
but
she
felt
her
necessity
as
well
as
her
and
made
allowance
for
her
visitor
want
of
sophistication
he
was
like
an
indian
before
a
mirror
in
a
stolid
excitement
of
apprehension
and
delight
the
most
beautiful
thing
he
ever
saw
was
within
the
compass
of
his
full
sight
at
last
and
whether
to
detain
it
by
force
or
persuasion
he
did
not
know
her
dark
hair
silky
as
the
cleanest
tassels
of
the
corn
fell
as
naturally
upon
her
perfect
head
as
her
teeth
white
as
the
milky
moved
in
the
may
cherries
of
her
lips
the
delicate
arches
of
her
brows
shaded
by
blackbirds
wings
enriched
the
clear
sky
of
her
harmonious
eyes
where
mercy
and
nobility
kept
company
as
in
heaven
how
could
you
know
i
was
unselfish
mr
milburn
because
i
have
heard
you
sing
oh
yes
you
hear
me
in
our
church
i
remember
i
have
heard
you
every
sunday
that
you
sung
there
for
years
said
meshach
with
hardly
a
change
of
expression
are
you
fond
of
music
mr
milburn
yes
i
like
all
i
have
ever
heard
birds
and
you
i
will
sing
for
you
then
said
vesta
taking
the
relief
the
talk
directed
her
to
a
piano
was
in
another
room
but
to
avoid
changing
the
scene
as
well
as
to
use
a
simpler
accompaniment
for
an
ignorant
ears
she
brought
her
guitar
and
placing
it
in
her
lap
struck
the
strings
and
the
key
without
waiting
to
these
tender
words
oh
for
some
sadly
dying
note
upon
this
silent
hour
to
float
where
from
the
bustling
world
remote
the
lyre
might
wake
its
melody
one
feeble
strain
is
all
can
swell
from
mine
almost
deserted
shell
in
mournful
accents
yet
to
tell
that
slumbers
not
its
minstrelsy
there
is
an
hour
of
deep
repose
that
yet
upon
my
heart
shall
close
when
all
that
nature
dreads
and
knows
shall
burst
upon
me
wondrously
oh
may
i
then
awake
forever
my
harp
to
rapture
high
endeavor
and
as
from
earth
vain
scene
i
sever
be
lost
in
immortality
vesta
ceased
a
few
minutes
and
her
visitor
saying
nothing
she
remarked
with
emotion
those
lines
were
written
at
my
grandfather
house
in
accomac
county
by
a
young
clergyman
from
new
york
who
was
grandfather
rector
rev
james
eastburn
he
was
only
years
old
when
he
died
at
sea
of
consumption
his
is
the
only
poetry
i
have
ever
heard
of
milburn
written
in
our
beautiful
old
country
here
i
wondered
if
i
should
ever
hear
you
sing
for
me
spoke
milburn
after
hesitation
now
it
is
realized
i
feel
sceptical
about
it
you
are
there
miss
custis
are
you
not
vesta
was
puzzled
under
other
circumstances
she
would
have
been
amused
since
her
humor
could
flow
freely
as
her
music
it
faintly
seemed
to
her
that
the
little
odd
man
might
be
cracked
in
the
head
yes
indeed
milburn
if
it
were
a
dream
i
should
have
no
expression
all
this
day
but
song
i
think
i
never
felt
so
sad
to
sing
as
just
now
father
is
mamma
is
ill
i
have
become
the
business
agent
of
the
family
and
have
heard
within
this
hour
that
papa
is
deeply
involved
you
are
his
creditor
are
you
not
meshach
milburn
bowed
what
is
the
sum
of
papa
notes
and
mortgages
is
it
more
than
he
can
pay
by
the
sacrifice
of
everything
yes
he
has
nothing
to
sell
at
forced
sale
which
will
bring
anything
but
the
household
servants
here
these
maids
in
the
family
are
marketable
immediately
you
would
not
like
to
sell
them
sell
virgie
she
was
brought
up
with
me
what
right
have
i
to
sell
her
any
more
than
she
has
to
sell
me
none
said
milburn
bluntly
but
there
is
law
for
it
to
sell
roxy
too
and
old
aunt
hominy
and
the
young
children
how
could
i
ever
pray
again
if
they
were
sold
oh
milburn
where
was
your
heart
to
let
papa
waste
his
plentiful
substance
in
such
a
hopeless
experiment
if
my
singing
in
the
church
has
given
you
happiness
why
could
it
not
move
you
to
mercy
think
of
the
despair
of
this
family
my
father
helpless
generosity
my
mother
marriage
settlement
gone
too
and
every
other
son
and
daughter
parted
from
them
i
never
encouraged
one
moment
judge
custis
expenditure
said
meshach
though
i
lent
him
money
the
first
time
he
came
to
me
to
borrow
my
mind
was
in
a
liberal
disposition
for
you
had
just
entered
it
with
your
innocent
attentions
i
supposed
he
wanted
a
temporary
accommodation
and
i
gave
it
to
him
at
the
lowest
rate
one
christian
would
charge
another
you
say
that
i
influenced
you
to
lend
my
father
money
why
sir
i
was
a
child
he
has
been
borrowing
from
you
since
my
earliest
recollections
the
creditor
took
from
his
a
large
leather
wallet
and
arising
laid
its
contents
on
the
table
he
opened
a
piece
of
folded
paper
and
drew
from
it
two
objects
one
a
lock
of
hair
like
his
own
and
the
other
a
pressed
and
faded
rose
this
flower
said
milburn
with
reverence
judge
custis
daughter
fastened
in
my
derided
hat
i
kept
it
till
it
was
dead
and
laid
it
away
with
my
mother
hair
the
two
religious
objects
of
my
life
that
faded
rose
made
me
your
father
creditor
miss
custis
vesta
took
the
rose
and
looked
at
him
with
surprise
and
inquiry
oh
why
did
not
this
flower
speak
for
us
she
said
to
open
your
lips
after
that
to
save
my
father
then
you
informed
yourself
and
knew
that
he
was
hurrying
to
destruction
but
still
you
gave
him
money
at
higher
interest
milburn
looked
at
her
with
diminished
courage
but
sincerity
and
answered
your
voice
sang
between
us
miss
custis
every
time
he
came
i
did
not
admit
to
myself
what
it
was
but
the
feeling
that
i
was
being
drawn
near
you
still
opened
my
purse
to
your
father
till
he
has
drained
me
of
the
profits
of
years
which
i
gave
him
with
a
lavish
fatality
though
grasping
every
cent
from
every
source
but
that
i
did
know
then
he
could
not
probably
repay
me
but
every
sabbath
at
the
church
you
sang
and
that
seemed
some
compensation
i
was
bewitched
indistinct
visions
of
gratitude
and
recognition
from
you
filled
the
preaching
with
concourses
of
angels
all
bearing
your
image
and
hovering
above
me
the
price
i
paid
for
that
unuttered
and
hope
has
been
princely
but
never
grudged
and
it
has
been
pure
i
believe
or
heaven
would
have
punished
me
the
more
i
ruined
myself
for
your
father
the
more
successful
my
ventures
were
in
all
other
places
if
you
were
my
temptation
it
had
the
favor
or
forgiveness
of
the
god
in
whose
temple
it
was
born
vesta
arose
also
with
a
frightened
spirit
do
i
understand
you
she
said
with
her
rich
gray
eyes
wide
open
under
their
startled
lashes
my
father
has
spoken
of
a
degrading
condition
is
it
to
love
you
for
the
first
time
meshach
milburn
dropped
his
eyes
i
never
supposed
it
possible
for
you
to
love
me
he
said
bitterly
i
thought
god
might
permit
me
some
day
to
love
you
do
you
know
what
love
is
asked
vesta
with
astonishment
no
how
came
you
then
to
be
interpreting
my
good
acts
so
basely
carrying
even
my
childhood
about
in
your
evil
imagination
and
cursing
my
father
sorrow
with
the
threat
of
his
daughter
slavery
milburn
heard
with
perfect
humility
these
hard
imputations
you
have
not
loved
i
think
miss
custis
he
said
with
a
slight
flush
i
have
believed
you
never
did
he
raised
his
eyes
again
to
her
face
i
loved
my
father
above
everything
faltered
vesta
i
saw
no
man
besides
admiring
my
father
then
i
displaced
no
man
right
coveting
your
image
sometimes
it
seemed
you
were
being
kept
free
so
long
to
reward
my
silent
worship
i
do
not
know
what
love
is
but
i
know
the
gifts
of
god
as
they
bloom
in
nature
repel
no
man
devotion
the
flowers
the
birds
and
the
forest
delighted
my
childhood
my
youth
was
spent
in
the
study
of
myself
and
man
at
last
a
beautiful
child
appeared
to
me
spoke
her
way
to
my
soul
and
it
could
never
expel
her
glorious
presence
all
things
became
subordinate
to
her
even
avarice
and
success
she
kept
me
a
christian
or
i
should
have
become
utterly
selfish
she
kept
me
humble
for
what
was
my
wealth
when
i
could
not
enter
her
father
house
i
am
here
by
a
destiny
now
the
power
that
called
you
to
this
room
so
unexpectedly
to
me
has
borne
us
onward
to
the
secret
i
dreaded
to
speak
to
you
dare
i
go
further
she
was
trying
to
keep
down
her
insulted
feelings
and
not
say
something
that
should
forever
exasperate
her
father
creditor
but
the
possibility
of
marrying
him
was
too
tremendous
to
reply
this
moment
is
a
great
one
continued
milburn
firmly
for
i
feel
that
it
is
to
terminate
my
visions
of
happiness
and
of
kindness
as
well
you
have
expressed
yourself
so
indignantly
that
i
see
no
thought
of
me
has
ever
lodged
in
your
mind
why
should
it
have
ever
done
so
though
i
almost
dreamed
it
had
because
you
filled
my
life
so
many
years
with
your
rich
image
i
thought
you
might
have
felt
me
like
an
apparition
stealing
around
this
dwelling
often
in
the
dark
and
rain
content
with
the
ray
of
light
your
window
threw
upon
the
deserted
street
now
i
see
that
i
was
a
weak
dunce
whose
passion
nature
lent
no
nerve
of
hers
to
convey
even
to
your
notice
better
for
me
that
i
had
hugged
the
debasing
reality
of
my
gold
and
lost
my
eyes
to
everything
but
its
comfort
he
looked
towards
the
door
vesta
sat
down
in
the
fairy
rocker
and
detained
him
you
have
told
me
the
feeling
you
think
you
had
milburn
poor
as
we
custises
are
now
it
will
not
do
to
be
proud
how
did
you
ever
think
that
feeling
could
be
returned
by
me
my
youth
my
connections
everything
would
forbid
me
without
haughtiness
to
see
a
suitor
in
you
then
you
took
no
means
to
turn
my
attention
towards
you
you
could
have
been
neighborly
had
you
desired
you
did
not
even
wear
the
commonest
emblems
of
a
lover
she
paused
milburn
said
to
himself
ah
that
accursed
hat
the
interruption
ruffled
his
temper
i
have
had
reasons
also
proud
miss
custis
to
be
consistent
with
my
perpetual
self
here
i
will
put
the
substantial
merits
of
my
case
to
you
since
i
see
that
i
am
not
likely
to
make
myself
otherwise
attractive
this
house
is
already
mine
the
law
will
in
a
few
weeks
put
me
in
possession
of
your
father
entire
property
i
shall
change
outward
circumstances
with
him
in
princess
anne
he
is
too
old
to
adopt
my
sacrifices
and
recover
his
situation
he
may
find
some
shifting
refuge
with
his
sons
and
daughters
but
even
if
his
spirit
could
brook
that
dependence
it
would
be
very
unnecessary
when
by
marrying
his
creditor
you
can
retain
everything
he
now
has
to
make
his
family
respectable
i
offer
you
his
estate
as
your
marriage
portion
he
took
up
from
the
table
the
notes
her
father
had
negotiated
and
laid
them
in
her
lap
vesta
sat
rocking
slowly
and
deeply
agitated
she
had
in
her
mouth
the
comfort
and
honor
of
her
parents
which
she
could
confer
in
a
single
word
it
was
a
responsibility
so
mighty
that
it
made
her
tremble
oh
what
shall
i
say
she
thought
it
will
be
a
sin
to
say
to
say
would
be
a
crime
you
shall
retain
every
feature
of
your
home
your
servants
your
mother
and
her
undiminished
portion
your
liberty
in
the
fullest
sense
i
will
contribute
to
send
your
father
to
the
legislature
or
to
congress
to
sustain
his
pride
and
keep
him
well
occupied
the
furnace
he
may
appear
to
have
sold
to
me
and
i
will
accept
the
unpopularity
of
closing
it
i
ask
only
to
serve
you
and
inhabit
your
daily
life
like
one
of
these
negroes
you
are
kind
to
and
if
i
am
ever
harsh
to
you
miss
vesta
i
swear
to
surrender
you
to
your
family
and
depart
forever
vesta
shook
her
head
there
is
no
separation
but
one
she
said
when
heaven
has
been
called
down
to
the
marriage
solemnity
it
is
before
that
act
that
we
must
consider
everything
how
could
i
make
you
happy
my
own
happiness
i
will
dismiss
yours
must
then
comprehend
mine
kindness
might
make
me
grateful
but
gratitude
will
not
satisfy
your
love
yes
exclaimed
milburn
chasing
up
his
advantage
with
tremulous
ardor
the
long
famine
of
my
heart
will
be
thankful
for
a
dry
crust
and
a
cup
of
ice
here
at
the
fireside
let
me
sit
and
warm
and
hear
the
rustle
of
your
dress
and
grow
in
heavenly
sensibility
you
will
redeem
a
savage
you
will
save
a
soul
it
is
not
the
price
i
must
pay
to
do
this
i
would
have
you
consider
sir
vesta
replied
with
her
attention
somewhat
arrested
by
his
intensity
it
is
the
price
you
are
paying
your
perhaps
by
the
terms
on
which
you
obtain
me
it
may
never
be
known
out
of
this
family
that
i
married
you
for
the
sake
of
my
father
and
mother
but
how
am
i
to
prevent
you
from
remembering
it
especially
when
you
say
that
i
am
the
sum
of
your
purest
wishes
if
your
interest
would
consume
after
you
obtained
me
we
might
at
least
be
indifferent
but
if
it
grew
into
real
love
would
you
not
often
accuse
yourself
meshach
milburn
sat
down
cast
his
large
brown
eyes
upon
the
floor
and
listened
in
painful
reflection
you
can
not
conceive
i
have
had
any
real
love
for
you
he
exclaimed
dubiously
you
have
seen
me
and
desired
me
for
your
wife
that
is
all
said
vesta
that
i
can
imagine
lawless
power
could
do
that
anywhere
to
be
an
obedient
wife
is
the
lot
of
woman
but
love
such
as
you
have
some
glimmering
of
is
a
mystic
instinct
so
mutual
so
gladdening
yet
so
free
that
the
captivity
you
set
me
in
to
make
me
sing
to
you
will
divide
us
like
the
wires
of
a
cage
there
is
no
bird
i
ever
caught
said
meshach
milburn
that
did
not
learn
to
trust
me
your
comparison
does
not
therefore
discourage
me
and
you
have
already
sung
for
me
the
saddest
day
of
your
life
a
slight
touch
of
nature
in
this
revelation
of
her
strange
suitor
called
vesta
attention
to
the
study
of
him
again
with
her
intelligence
and
sense
of
higher
worth
coming
to
her
rescue
she
thought
let
me
see
all
that
is
of
this
tartar
for
perhaps
there
may
be
another
way
to
his
mercy
as
she
recovered
composure
however
she
grew
more
beautiful
in
his
sight
her
dark
peerless
charms
filling
the
room
her
kindling
eyes
conveying
love
her
skin
like
the
wild
plum
and
her
raven
brows
and
crown
of
luxuriant
hair
rising
upon
a
queenly
presence
worthy
of
an
empress
throne
such
beauty
almost
made
milburn
afraid
but
the
energies
of
his
character
were
all
concentrated
to
secure
it
who
you
she
asked
with
a
calm
searching
look
cast
from
her
highest
and
alert
intelligence
have
you
any
relations
or
connections
fit
to
bring
here
to
this
house
to
me
not
one
that
i
know
said
the
forester
i
am
nothing
but
myself
and
what
you
will
make
of
me
where
were
you
born
and
reared
the
house
does
not
stand
which
witnessed
that
misery
spoke
milburn
with
a
flush
of
obdurate
pride
it
was
burned
last
night
not
far
from
the
furnace
which
swallowed
your
father
substance
why
i
would
be
afraid
of
you
milburn
if
your
errand
here
was
not
so
practical
omens
and
wonders
surround
you
birds
forget
their
natural
life
for
you
iron
ceases
to
be
occult
when
you
take
it
up
your
birthplace
in
this
world
disappears
by
fire
the
night
before
you
foreclose
a
mortgage
upon
a
gentleman
daughter
is
all
this
sorcery
inseparable
from
that
necromancer
hat
you
wear
in
princess
anne
she
had
touched
the
sensitive
topic
by
a
skilful
approach
yet
he
changed
color
as
if
the
allusion
piqued
him
nature
never
rebuked
my
hat
miss
vesta
and
you
are
so
like
nature
it
will
not
occupy
your
thoughts
i
recollect
the
day
you
decorated
my
old
hat
said
i
this
vagrant
after
all
its
injuries
and
wanderings
may
some
day
find
a
peg
beneath
my
own
roof
and
the
kind
welcome
of
a
lady
like
that
little
miss
that
was
several
years
ago
and
for
the
first
time
my
hat
is
on
the
rack
of
your
hall
the
long
wish
of
the
heart
is
not
often
denied
we
are
not
responsible
for
it
the
only
conspiracy
i
have
plotted
here
was
that
i
did
not
oppose
most
natural
occurrences
all
drawing
towards
this
scene
my
magic
was
hope
and
humility
i
dared
to
wear
my
ancestor
hat
in
the
face
of
a
contemptuous
and
impertinent
provincial
public
and
it
gave
me
the
pride
to
persevere
till
i
should
bring
it
home
to
honors
and
to
noble
shelter
if
you
despise
my
hat
you
will
despise
me
oh
no
milburn
i
try
never
to
despise
anything
if
you
wore
your
family
hat
from
some
filial
respect
it
was
in
part
piety
but
was
that
indeed
your
motive
in
being
so
eccentric
milburn
felt
uneasy
again
he
hesitated
and
said
in
perfect
truth
i
fear
not
there
may
have
been
something
of
revenge
in
my
mind
i
had
been
grossly
insulted
is
it
not
something
of
that
revenge
which
instigates
you
here
even
in
this
profession
of
love
exclaimed
vesta
judicially
meshach
looked
up
and
the
shadows
cleared
from
his
face
i
can
answer
that
truthfully
lady
towards
you
not
an
indignant
thought
has
ever
harbored
in
my
brain
it
has
been
the
opposite
protection
worship
tender
sensibility
has
that
exceptional
charity
extended
to
my
father
no
vesta
would
have
been
exasperated
but
for
his
candor
my
father
never
insulted
you
sir
no
he
patronized
me
he
meant
no
harm
but
that
old
hat
has
worn
a
deep
place
in
my
brain
through
carrying
it
so
long
and
it
is
a
subject
that
galls
me
to
mention
it
yet
i
must
be
consistent
with
my
only
eccentricity
wherever
i
may
go
there
goes
my
hat
it
makes
my
identity
my
inflexibility
it
achieves
my
promise
to
myself
that
men
shall
respect
my
hat
before
i
die
pardon
me
said
vesta
not
uninterested
in
his
character
i
can
understand
an
eccentricity
founded
on
family
respect
we
were
virginians
and
that
is
next
to
religion
there
the
negroes
of
our
family
share
it
with
us
you
had
a
family
then
milburn
shook
his
head
no
not
a
family
in
the
sense
you
mean
generations
of
obscurity
a
parentage
only
virtuous
no
tombstone
anywhere
no
crest
nor
motto
not
even
a
lie
of
some
former
gentility
shaped
from
hand
to
hand
till
it
commits
a
larceny
on
history
and
is
brazen
on
a
carriage
panel
we
were
foresters
we
came
forth
and
existed
and
perished
like
the
families
of
ants
upon
the
of
sand
we
migrated
no
more
than
the
woodpeckers
in
your
sycamore
trees
and
made
no
sound
in
events
more
than
their
insectivorous
tapping
out
yonder
beyond
dividing
creek
in
the
thickets
of
small
oak
and
low
pines
many
a
little
farm
scratched
from
the
devouring
forest
speckling
the
plains
and
wastes
with
huts
and
with
little
barns
of
logs
once
bore
the
name
of
milburn
through
all
the
localities
of
the
pocomoke
to
and
beyond
the
great
cypress
swamp
they
are
dying
but
never
dead
the
few
who
live
expect
no
recognition
from
me
and
happy
in
their
poverty
envy
me
nothing
i
have
accumulated
my
name
has
grown
hard
to
them
my
hat
is
the
subject
of
their
superstitions
my
ambition
and
success
have
lost
me
their
sympathy
without
giving
me
any
other
social
compensation
you
behold
a
desperate
man
a
merciless
creditor
a
tussock
of
ore
from
the
bogs
of
nassawongo
yet
one
whose
only
crimes
have
been
to
adore
you
and
to
wear
his
forefathers
hat
is
this
pride
then
wholly
insulted
sensibility
mr
milburn
i
can
not
say
miss
custis
you
may
smile
but
i
think
it
is
aristocracy
i
think
so
too
exclaimed
vesta
reflectively
you
are
a
proud
man
my
father
who
has
had
reason
to
be
proud
is
less
an
aristocrat
sir
than
you
milburn
flush
came
and
stayed
a
considerable
while
he
was
not
displeased
at
vesta
compliment
though
it
bore
the
nature
of
an
accusation
you
are
aristocratic
explained
vesta
because
you
adopted
the
obsolete
hat
of
your
people
whatever
vanity
led
you
to
do
it
it
was
the
satisfaction
of
some
origin
i
think
she
checked
herself
seeing
that
she
was
entering
into
his
affairs
with
too
much
freedom
i
suppose
that
somewhere
some
time
spoke
the
strange
visitor
some
person
of
my
race
has
been
influential
and
prosperous
indeed
i
have
been
told
so
he
was
elevated
to
both
the
magistracy
and
the
scaffold
but
my
hat
had
even
an
older
origin
tell
me
about
that
ancestor
said
vesta
the
heartache
from
his
greater
errand
instigating
her
to
defer
it
while
she
was
yet
barely
conscious
that
the
man
was
original
if
not
interesting
he
told
a
singular
tale
tracing
his
hat
to
raleigh
times
and
through
sir
henry
vane
to
america
till
it
became
the
property
of
jacob
milborne
the
popular
martyr
who
was
executed
in
new
york
and
his
brethren
driven
into
maryland
bringing
with
them
the
harmless
hat
as
their
only
patrimony
before
he
began
milburn
drew
up
his
compact
little
figure
and
opened
the
door
to
the
hall
the
wind
or
air
from
some
of
the
large
cold
apartments
of
the
long
house
coming
in
by
some
crack
or
open
sash
gave
almost
a
shriek
and
scattered
the
fire
in
the
chimney
vesta
felt
her
blood
chill
a
moment
as
her
visitor
with
the
antediluvian
hat
and
placed
it
upon
the
table
beneath
the
lamp
it
had
that
look
of
gentility
victorious
over
decay
which
suggested
the
mummy
of
some
pharaoh
brought
into
a
on
a
learned
society
night
vesta
repressed
a
smile
rising
through
her
pain
at
the
gravity
of
the
forester
guest
who
was
about
to
demonstrate
his
aristocracy
through
this
old
hat
it
seemed
to
her
also
that
the
portraits
of
the
custises
on
the
wall
carried
indignant
noses
in
the
air
at
their
apparently
conscious
knowledge
of
the
presence
of
some
unburied
pretender
as
if
in
westminster
abbey
the
effigies
of
the
norman
kings
had
slightly
aroused
to
feel
oliver
cromwell
lying
among
them
in
state
the
hat
vesta
perceived
was
flemish
such
as
was
popular
in
england
while
the
netherlands
was
her
ally
against
the
house
of
spain
and
stripped
of
its
ornaments
was
lengthened
into
the
hat
of
the
puritans
vesta
attempted
to
exert
her
liberality
and
perceive
some
beauty
in
this
hat
but
the
utmost
she
could
admit
was
the
tyranny
of
fashion
over
the
mind
it
seemed
over
the
soul
itself
for
this
old
hat
inoffensive
as
it
was
weighed
down
her
spirits
like
a
the
man
without
his
hat
had
somewhat
redeemed
himself
from
low
conversation
and
ideas
but
now
that
he
brought
this
hat
in
and
associated
his
person
with
it
she
shrank
from
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
jew
peddling
around
the
premises
the
obnoxious
hat
also
exercised
some
exciting
influence
over
meshach
milburn
if
his
changed
manner
could
be
ascribed
to
that
article
for
he
resumed
his
strong
stare
deepened
and
lowered
his
voice
and
without
waiting
for
any
query
or
expression
of
his
listener
told
the
tale
chapter
ix
ha
ha
the
wooing
o
it
was
twilight
when
meshach
milburn
closed
his
story
and
silence
and
pallid
eve
drew
together
in
the
custis
resembling
the
two
people
there
thinking
on
matrimony
the
one
grave
as
conscious
serpenthood
could
make
him
the
other
fluttering
like
the
charmed
bird
vesta
spoke
first
how
intense
must
be
your
head
to
create
so
many
objects
around
it
within
the
world
of
a
hat
you
have
only
brought
the
story
down
a
little
way
towards
our
times
i
began
the
tale
of
raleigh
out
of
proportion
said
milburn
and
it
grew
upon
the
same
scale
like
the
passion
i
conceived
for
you
so
intensely
at
the
outset
that
in
the
climax
of
this
night
i
am
scarcely
begun
yet
like
raleigh
i
see
the
scaffold
said
vesta
with
an
attempt
at
humor
that
for
the
first
time
broke
her
down
and
she
raised
her
hands
to
her
face
to
hush
the
burst
of
anguish
it
would
not
be
repressed
and
one
low
cry
deep
with
the
sense
of
desertion
and
captivity
sounded
through
the
deepening
room
and
smote
milburn
innermost
heart
he
obeyed
an
impulse
he
had
not
felt
since
his
mother
died
starting
towards
vesta
and
throwing
his
arms
around
her
and
drawing
her
to
his
breast
honey
honey
he
whispered
kissing
her
like
a
child
do
cry
now
honey
it
will
break
my
heart
the
act
of
nature
seldom
is
misinterpreted
vesta
having
labored
so
long
alone
with
this
obdurate
man
her
young
faculties
of
the
head
strained
by
the
first
encounter
beyond
her
strength
accepted
the
friendship
of
his
sympathy
and
contrition
as
if
he
had
been
her
father
in
a
few
moments
the
paroxysm
of
grief
was
past
and
she
disengaged
his
arms
you
are
not
merciless
said
vesta
tell
me
what
i
must
do
you
have
broken
my
father
down
and
he
can
not
come
to
my
help
take
pity
on
my
inequality
and
advise
me
alas
child
said
milburn
my
advice
must
be
in
my
own
interest
though
i
wish
i
could
find
your
confidence
i
am
a
poor
creature
and
do
not
know
how
it
is
you
who
must
encourage
the
faith
i
feel
starting
somewhere
in
this
room
like
a
chimney
swallow
that
would
fain
fly
out
chirrup
chirrup
to
it
and
it
may
come
standing
a
moment
trying
to
collect
her
thoughts
and
wholly
failing
vesta
accepted
the
confidence
he
held
out
to
her
with
open
arms
blushing
as
she
had
never
blushed
in
her
life
though
he
could
not
know
it
in
the
evening
dark
she
walked
to
him
and
kissed
him
once
will
that
encourage
you
to
advise
me
like
a
friend
she
said
alas
no
sighed
milburn
fervently
it
makes
me
the
more
your
unjust
lover
i
can
not
advise
you
away
from
me
oh
let
me
plead
for
myself
i
love
you
then
what
shall
i
do
exclaimed
vesta
in
low
tones
if
you
are
unable
to
rise
to
the
height
of
my
friend
and
my
father
is
your
slave
do
you
think
god
can
bless
your
prosperity
when
you
are
so
hard
with
your
debtor
on
me
the
full
sacrifice
falls
though
i
never
was
in
your
debt
consciously
and
i
have
never
to
my
remembrance
wished
injury
to
any
one
would
you
accept
your
father
independence
at
the
expense
of
the
most
despised
man
in
princess
anne
milburn
spoke
without
changing
his
kind
tone
would
you
let
me
give
him
the
fruit
of
many
years
of
hard
toil
and
careful
saving
in
order
that
i
shall
be
disappointed
in
the
only
motive
of
assisting
him
the
honorable
wooing
of
his
daughter
she
felt
her
pride
rising
your
father
debts
to
me
are
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
continued
milburn
do
you
ask
me
to
present
that
sum
to
you
and
retire
to
my
loneliness
out
of
this
bright
light
of
home
and
family
warmth
and
music
that
you
have
made
that
is
the
test
you
put
my
love
to
banishment
from
you
will
you
ask
it
i
have
not
asked
for
your
money
sir
said
vesta
yet
i
have
heard
of
love
doing
as
much
as
that
relieving
the
anguish
of
its
object
and
finding
sufficient
joy
in
the
deed
i
do
not
think
you
personally
know
of
any
such
case
though
you
may
have
read
it
in
a
novel
or
tract
men
have
died
and
left
a
fortune
they
could
no
longer
keep
to
some
cherished
lady
or
they
have
made
a
considerable
sacrifice
for
a
beautiful
and
noble
woman
but
where
did
you
ever
hear
miss
vesta
of
a
famished
lover
surrendering
every
endowment
that
might
win
the
peerless
one
to
be
himself
returned
to
his
sorrow
tortured
still
by
love
and
by
his
neighbors
ridiculed
what
would
princess
anne
say
of
me
that
i
had
been
made
a
fool
of
and
hurl
new
epithets
after
my
hat
vesta
searched
her
mind
thinking
she
must
alight
upon
some
such
example
there
but
none
suited
the
case
meshach
took
advantage
of
her
silence
the
gifts
of
a
lover
are
everywhere
steps
to
love
as
i
have
understood
he
makes
his
impression
with
them
they
are
expected
nothing
creates
happiness
like
a
gift
and
it
is
an
old
saying
that
blessings
await
him
who
gives
and
also
her
who
takes
and
that
to
seek
and
ask
and
knock
are
praiseworthy
oh
said
vesta
but
to
be
milburn
to
be
weighed
against
a
father
debts
is
it
not
degrading
not
where
such
respect
and
cherishing
as
mine
will
be
rather
exalt
yourself
as
more
valuable
to
a
miser
than
his
whole
lendings
and
greater
than
all
your
father
losses
as
an
equivalent
and
even
then
putting
your
husband
in
debt
being
so
much
richer
than
his
account
where
will
be
my
share
of
love
in
this
world
married
so
asked
vesta
to
love
is
the
globe
itself
to
a
woman
her
youth
the
mere
atmosphere
thereof
her
widowhood
the
perfume
of
that
extinguished
star
and
all
my
mind
has
been
alert
to
discover
the
image
i
shall
serve
the
bright
youth
ready
for
me
looking
on
one
after
another
to
see
if
it
might
be
he
and
suddenly
you
hold
between
me
and
my
faith
a
paper
with
my
father
obligations
and
say
is
your
fate
this
is
your
whole
romance
you
are
foreclosed
upon
how
are
you
to
take
a
withered
heart
like
that
and
find
glad
companionship
in
it
no
you
will
be
disappointed
it
will
recoil
upon
me
that
i
sold
myself
the
image
you
waited
for
may
have
come
said
milburn
undauntedly
even
in
me
for
love
often
springs
from
an
ambush
nor
can
you
prepare
the
heart
for
it
like
a
field
i
recollect
a
fable
i
read
of
a
god
loving
a
woman
and
he
burst
upon
her
in
a
shower
of
gold
and
what
was
that
but
a
rich
man
wooing
we
get
gold
to
equalize
nobility
in
women
beauty
is
luxurious
and
demands
adornment
and
a
rich
setting
the
richest
man
in
princess
anne
is
not
good
enough
for
you
and
the
mere
boys
your
mind
has
been
filled
with
are
more
unworthy
of
being
your
husband
than
the
humble
creditor
of
your
father
such
a
creation
as
miss
vesta
required
a
special
sacrifice
and
success
in
the
character
of
her
husband
the
annual
life
of
this
peninsula
could
not
match
you
and
a
monster
had
to
be
raised
to
carry
you
away
you
are
not
exactly
a
monster
vesta
remarked
with
natural
compassion
and
you
compliment
me
so
warmly
that
it
relieves
the
strain
of
this
encounter
a
little
do
not
draw
a
woman
attention
to
your
defects
as
she
might
otherwise
be
charmed
by
your
voice
that
also
is
a
part
of
my
sacrifice
said
meshach
like
the
money
which
i
have
accumulated
without
a
teacher
but
love
and
hope
i
have
educated
myself
to
be
fit
to
talk
to
you
it
is
all
crude
now
like
a
crow
that
i
have
taught
to
speak
but
encouragement
will
make
me
confident
and
saucy
and
you
will
forget
my
sable
raiment
even
my
hat
a
chilliness
seemed
to
attend
this
conclusion
and
vesta
touched
her
bell
virgie
entering
took
her
mistress
instructions
bring
a
tray
and
tea
and
lights
and
place
milburn
hat
upon
the
rack
the
girl
glanced
at
the
antique
hat
with
a
timid
light
in
her
eye
but
her
mistress
head
was
turned
as
if
to
intimate
that
she
must
take
it
though
it
might
be
virgie
obeyed
and
soon
brought
in
the
tea
it
is
good
tea
spoke
milburn
drinking
not
from
the
cup
but
the
saucer
while
vesta
observed
him
oddly
and
it
is
chill
this
evening
let
me
start
your
fire
he
shivered
a
little
as
he
stood
up
and
walked
across
the
room
and
poking
the
charred
logs
into
a
flame
and
setting
on
more
wood
he
made
the
walls
spring
into
yellow
flashes
between
which
vesta
saw
her
forefathers
dart
cold
glances
at
her
in
their
gilt
frames
yet
how
helpless
they
were
with
all
their
respectability
to
take
her
body
or
her
father
honor
out
of
pawn
and
she
felt
for
the
first
time
the
hollowness
of
family
power
except
in
the
mail
of
a
solvent
posterity
she
also
made
a
long
careful
survey
of
her
suitor
to
see
if
there
was
any
apology
for
him
as
a
husband
his
figure
was
short
but
with
strength
and
elasticity
in
it
better
clothes
might
fit
him
daintily
and
vesta
him
in
fancy
with
lavender
kids
upon
his
small
hands
a
ring
upon
his
long
little
finger
a
carnelian
seal
and
a
ribbon
at
his
and
ruffles
in
his
in
place
of
his
dull
cloth
suit
she
would
give
him
a
buff
vest
and
pearl
buttons
with
eyelet
rings
and
white
gaiters
instead
of
those
shabby
green
things
over
his
feet
and
put
upon
his
head
a
neat
silk
hat
with
narrow
brim
to
raise
his
height
slenderly
and
let
a
coat
of
olive
or
and
trousers
of
the
same
color
relieve
his
ornaments
thus
transformed
vesta
could
conceive
a
peculiar
yet
a
passable
man
whom
a
lady
might
grow
considerate
towards
by
much
praying
and
striving
and
she
wondered
now
how
this
man
had
managed
to
soothe
her
already
to
that
degree
that
she
had
voluntarily
kissed
him
she
would
be
afraid
to
do
it
again
but
it
was
as
clearly
on
record
as
that
she
had
once
put
a
flower
in
his
hat
and
vesta
said
to
herself
he
has
power
of
some
kind
that
story
little
as
i
heard
of
it
was
told
with
an
opinionated
confidence
i
wish
my
poor
father
had
something
of
could
i
ever
be
happy
with
this
man
by
study
and
piety
god
might
open
the
way
but
it
seems
closed
to
me
now
the
night
wears
on
miss
custis
spoke
meshach
its
rewards
are
already
great
to
me
when
may
i
return
i
think
we
must
determine
what
to
do
this
night
milburn
vesta
said
with
rising
determination
not
one
point
nearer
have
we
come
to
any
solution
of
this
obligation
of
my
father
we
have
considered
it
up
to
this
time
as
my
obligation
and
that
may
have
unduly
encouraged
you
sir
i
can
work
for
my
living
you
repeated
milburn
why
not
i
love
my
father
as
other
women
who
are
left
poor
work
for
their
children
or
a
sick
husband
why
should
not
i
for
him
poverty
has
no
terrors
but
but
the
loss
of
pride
you
hazard
that
whatever
happens
said
her
suitor
but
you
will
not
lose
it
by
evading
the
lesser
evil
for
the
greater
i
have
heard
of
women
who
fled
to
poverty
from
dissatisfaction
with
a
husband
but
pride
survived
and
made
poverty
dreadful
pride
in
either
case
increased
the
discontent
you
should
take
the
step
which
will
let
pride
be
absorbed
in
duty
if
not
in
love
duty
thought
vesta
that
is
a
reposeful
word
better
than
love
milburn
she
said
aloud
how
is
it
my
duty
to
do
what
you
ask
i
think
i
perceive
that
you
have
a
loyal
heart
a
conscientiousness
that
deceit
can
not
even
approach
something
has
already
made
you
slow
to
marriage
else
with
your
wonders
i
would
not
have
had
the
chance
to
be
now
rejected
by
you
marriage
has
become
too
formidable
perhaps
to
you
by
the
purity
of
your
heart
the
more
so
because
you
looked
upon
it
to
be
your
destiny
it
your
fate
but
you
contend
against
it
look
upon
it
then
as
a
duty
such
as
you
expect
in
others
in
your
slave
maid
for
instance
alas
vesta
said
she
may
marry
freely
i
am
the
slave
no
miss
vesta
she
has
been
free
but
sold
among
strangers
with
your
father
effects
will
feel
so
perishing
for
sympathy
and
protection
that
love
in
whatever
ugly
form
it
comes
will
be
god
blessing
to
her
poor
heart
what
you
repel
in
the
revulsion
of
fortune
the
yoke
of
a
husband
millions
of
women
have
bent
to
as
if
it
was
the
very
rainbow
of
promise
set
in
heaven
how
do
you
know
so
much
of
women
trials
milburn
have
you
had
sisters
or
other
ladies
to
woo
i
have
seen
human
nature
in
my
little
shop
not
like
your
rare
nature
refined
by
happy
fortune
and
descent
but
of
moderate
kind
and
struggling
downward
like
a
wounded
eagle
they
have
come
to
me
at
first
for
cheaper
articles
of
necessity
or
smaller
portions
than
other
stores
would
sell
looking
on
me
with
contempt
at
last
they
have
sacrificed
their
last
slave
their
last
pair
of
shoes
and
when
it
was
too
late
their
false
pride
has
surrendered
to
shelter
under
a
negro
hut
or
dance
barefooted
in
my
store
for
a
cup
of
whiskey
sir
exclaimed
vesta
indignantly
rising
from
her
rocker
do
you
set
this
warning
for
me
as
she
rose
meshach
milburn
thought
his
wealth
was
merely
pebbles
and
shells
to
her
perfection
now
animated
with
a
queen
spirit
miss
vesta
he
said
pardon
me
but
i
have
just
issued
from
many
generations
of
forest
poverty
and
knowing
how
hard
it
is
to
break
that
thraldom
i
would
stop
you
from
taking
the
first
step
towards
it
the
bloom
upon
your
cheek
the
mould
you
are
the
product
of
without
flaw
the
chaste
lady
tastes
and
thoughts
and
inborn
strength
and
joy
are
the
work
of
god
favor
to
your
family
for
generations
that
favor
he
continues
in
laying
those
family
burdens
on
another
shoulders
to
spare
you
the
toil
and
care
anxiety
and
slow
decay
that
this
violent
change
of
circumstances
means
it
would
be
a
sin
to
relapse
from
this
perfection
to
that
penury
i
can
not
see
that
honorable
poverty
would
make
me
less
a
woman
exclaimed
vesta
you
do
not
dread
poverty
because
you
do
not
know
it
milburn
continued
it
grows
in
this
region
like
the
old
and
little
oaks
over
a
neglected
farm
once
there
was
a
settlement
on
dividing
creek
where
justice
eloquence
talent
wit
and
heroism
made
the
social
centre
of
two
counties
but
they
moved
the
and
the
forest
speedily
choked
the
spot
now
not
an
echo
lingers
of
that
former
glory
you
can
save
your
house
from
being
swallowed
up
in
the
forest
by
marrying
the
forest
hero
vesta
said
though
she
immediately
regretted
it
yes
milburn
uttered
stubbornly
after
a
pause
i
have
met
the
house
of
custis
i
am
coming
out
of
the
woods
as
they
are
going
in
unless
the
sacrifice
be
mutual
let
us
not
be
personal
vesta
pleaded
with
her
grace
of
sorrow
i
feel
that
you
are
a
kind
man
at
least
to
me
but
a
poor
girl
must
make
a
struggle
for
herself
she
saw
the
tears
stand
instantly
in
his
eyes
and
pressed
her
advantage
your
tears
are
like
the
springs
we
find
here
so
close
under
the
flinty
sand
that
nobody
would
suspect
them
but
i
have
seen
them
trickle
out
tell
me
now
if
i
would
not
be
happier
to
take
up
the
burden
of
my
father
and
mother
and
let
us
diminish
and
be
frugal
instead
of
cowardly
flying
into
the
protection
of
our
creditor
by
a
union
which
the
world
at
least
would
pronounce
mercenary
my
father
might
come
up
again
in
some
way
no
miss
vesta
your
father
can
hold
no
property
while
any
portion
of
his
debts
remains
unpaid
the
easier
way
is
to
show
the
world
that
our
union
is
not
mercenary
by
trying
to
love
each
other
throughout
the
earth
marriage
is
the
reparation
of
ruined
families
the
short
path
and
the
most
natural
one
too
ruth
was
poor
kin
but
she
turned
from
the
harvest
stubble
that
made
her
beautiful
feet
bleed
to
crawl
to
the
feet
of
old
boaz
and
find
wifely
rest
and
her
wisdom
of
choice
we
sing
in
the
psalms
of
king
david
and
hear
in
the
proverbs
of
king
solomon
sons
of
her
sons
i
am
not
thinking
of
myself
god
knows
said
vesta
gladly
could
i
teach
a
little
school
or
be
a
governess
somewhere
or
like
our
connection
the
mother
of
washington
ride
afield
in
my
and
straw
hat
and
oversee
the
laborers
that
never
made
general
washington
miss
vesta
it
was
marriage
that
lent
him
to
the
world
first
his
marriage
with
the
fairfaxes
next
his
own
with
custis
rich
widow
had
they
been
looking
for
natural
parts
only
some
daniel
morgan
or
ethan
allen
would
have
been
washington
commander
why
do
you
draw
me
to
you
by
awakening
the
motive
of
my
asked
vesta
that
is
not
the
way
to
preserve
my
heart
as
you
would
have
it
in
every
way
i
can
draw
you
to
me
spoke
milburn
again
trembling
with
earnestness
i
feel
desperate
to
try
if
it
is
wrong
it
arises
from
my
sense
of
without
you
i
am
a
dismal
failure
and
my
labor
in
life
is
thrown
away
do
you
really
believe
you
love
me
is
it
not
ambition
of
some
kind
perhaps
a
social
ambition
to
marry
a
custis
milburn
exclaimed
no
it
is
to
marry
i
would
rather
you
were
not
a
custis
ah
i
see
sir
vesta
face
flushed
with
some
admiration
for
the
man
you
think
your
family
name
is
quite
as
good
so
you
ought
to
do
then
you
love
me
from
a
passion
partly
that
answered
milburn
i
love
you
from
my
whole
temperament
whatever
it
is
from
the
glow
of
youth
and
the
reflection
of
manhood
from
appreciation
of
you
and
from
worship
also
from
the
eye
and
the
mind
i
love
you
in
the
vision
of
domestic
settlement
in
the
companionship
of
thought
in
the
partition
of
my
ambition
in
my
instinct
for
cultivation
i
love
you
too
with
the
ardor
of
a
lover
stronger
than
all
because
i
must
possess
you
to
possess
myself
because
you
kindle
flame
in
me
and
my
humanity
of
pity
is
trampled
down
by
my
humanity
of
desire
i
can
not
hear
your
appeal
to
escape
i
am
deaf
to
sentiments
of
honor
and
courtesy
if
they
let
you
slip
me
give
yourself
to
me
and
these
better
angels
may
prevail
being
perhaps
accessory
to
the
mighty
instinct
i
obey
at
the
command
of
the
creator
as
he
proceeded
vesta
saw
shine
in
meshach
milburn
face
the
very
ecstacy
of
love
his
dark
resinous
eyes
were
like
forest
ponds
flashing
at
night
under
the
torches
of
negro
his
long
lady
hands
trembled
as
he
stretched
them
towards
her
to
clasp
her
and
she
saw
upon
his
brow
and
in
his
open
nostril
and
firm
mouth
the
presence
of
a
will
that
seldom
fails
when
exerted
mightily
to
reduce
a
woman
and
make
her
recognize
her
lord
yet
with
this
strong
excitement
of
mental
and
animal
love
which
generally
animates
man
to
eloquence
if
not
to
beauty
a
weary
something
nearly
like
pain
marked
the
bold
intruder
and
a
quiver
not
like
will
and
courage
went
through
his
frame
it
was
this
which
touched
vesta
with
the
sense
that
perhaps
she
was
not
the
only
sufferer
there
and
pity
which
saves
many
a
lover
when
his
merits
could
not
win
brought
the
judge
daughter
to
an
impulsive
determination
milburn
she
said
at
last
pressing
her
hands
to
her
head
this
day
trials
have
been
too
much
for
my
brain
never
in
all
my
life
together
have
i
had
realities
like
these
to
contend
with
i
am
worn
out
nay
sir
do
not
touch
me
now
he
had
tried
to
repeat
his
sympathetic
overture
and
pet
her
in
his
arms
let
us
end
this
conflict
at
once
you
say
you
will
marry
me
when
it
is
yours
to
say
when
miss
custis
i
am
ready
any
day
and
you
will
give
me
every
note
and
obligation
of
my
father
so
that
my
mother
portion
shall
be
returned
to
her
in
full
and
this
house
servants
and
demesnes
be
mine
in
my
own
right
yes
said
milburn
i
have
such
confidence
in
your
truth
and
virtue
that
you
shall
keep
these
papers
from
this
moment
until
the
it
will
not
be
long
then
vesta
said
looking
at
milburn
with
a
will
and
authority
fully
equal
to
his
own
will
you
take
me
he
repeated
not
surely
or
probably
never
he
drew
nearer
so
as
to
look
into
her
countenance
by
the
strong
firelight
calm
courage
that
would
die
like
joan
of
arc
in
the
flames
met
his
inquiry
yes
said
milburn
at
your
command
i
will
take
you
though
it
is
a
surprise
to
me
he
flinched
a
little
nevertheless
his
conscience
being
uneasy
and
the
same
trembling
vesta
had
already
observed
went
through
his
frame
again
what
will
the
world
say
to
your
marriage
after
a
single
acquaintance
with
me
nothing
vesta
answered
except
that
i
am
your
wife
that
will
at
least
silence
advice
and
prevent
intrusion
if
i
delay
these
forebodings
may
prevail
if
not
with
me
with
my
family
some
of
whom
are
to
be
feared
he
seemed
to
have
no
curiosity
on
that
subject
only
saying
it
is
you
dear
child
i
am
thinking
of
whether
this
haste
will
not
be
repented
or
become
a
subject
of
reproach
to
yourself
to
me
it
can
not
be
having
no
world
no
tribe
only
myself
and
you
vesta
came
forward
and
lifted
his
hand
which
was
cold
i
believe
that
you
love
me
she
said
i
believe
this
hand
has
the
lines
of
a
gentleman
now
i
will
trust
to
you
a
family
confidence
the
troubles
of
this
house
are
like
a
fire
which
there
is
no
other
way
of
treating
than
to
put
it
out
at
once
my
father
will
not
be
disturbed
beyond
his
secret
pain
at
the
step
i
am
to
take
for
he
appreciates
your
talents
and
success
it
is
for
him
i
shall
take
this
step
if
i
take
it
at
all
and
i
have
yet
an
hour
to
reflect
but
my
mother
will
be
resentful
and
her
brothers
and
kindred
in
baltimore
will
express
a
savage
rage
in
the
first
place
at
my
father
losing
her
portion
next
to
that
and
i
hope
less
bitterly
they
will
resent
my
marriage
to
you
exposed
to
their
interference
i
might
be
restrained
from
going
to
my
father
assistance
they
might
even
force
me
away
and
break
our
family
up
leaving
father
alone
to
encounter
his
miseries
i
see
said
milburn
you
would
give
me
the
legal
right
to
meet
your
mother
excited
people
not
that
merely
vesta
said
i
would
put
it
out
of
her
power
and
theirs
to
prevent
the
sacrifice
i
meditate
making
my
father
immediate
dread
is
my
mother
upbraiding
that
he
has
risked
and
lost
her
money
it
has
sent
her
to
bed
already
sick
and
almost
violent
i
might
as
well
save
the
poor
gentleman
his
whole
distress
if
i
am
to
save
him
a
part
brave
girl
exclaimed
meshach
milburn
in
admiration
it
is
true
then
that
blood
will
tell
you
intend
to
give
your
mother
the
money
which
has
been
lost
and
silence
her
complaint
before
she
makes
it
just
that
milburn
and
to
say
is
my
husband
gift
and
a
from
us
all
is
it
not
your
intention
honey
asked
the
creditor
to
take
custis
into
your
confidence
before
this
marriage
she
looked
at
him
with
the
entreaty
of
one
in
doubt
who
would
be
resolved
advise
me
she
said
i
want
to
do
the
best
for
all
and
spare
all
bitter
words
which
rankle
so
long
is
it
necessary
to
tell
my
mother
no
you
are
a
free
woman
i
know
your
age
though
i
shall
forget
it
by
and
by
this
first
gleam
of
humor
rather
became
his
strange
face
if
you
tell
your
father
it
is
enough
i
hope
i
am
doing
right
vesta
said
and
now
i
shall
take
my
hour
to
my
soul
and
my
saviour
sir
do
you
ever
pray
milburn
recoiled
a
little
i
do
not
pray
like
you
he
replied
my
prayers
are
dry
things
i
do
say
a
little
rhyme
over
that
my
mother
taught
me
in
the
forest
try
to
pray
for
me
to
do
right
said
vesta
that
i
may
not
make
this
sacrifice
and
leave
a
wounded
conscience
and
now
sir
farewell
at
nine
go
to
our
church
and
wait
if
i
resolve
to
come
there
you
will
find
the
rector
and
all
the
arrangements
made
if
i
do
not
come
i
think
you
will
see
me
no
more
oh
beautiful
spirit
exclaimed
her
lover
oppress
me
not
with
that
fear
if
another
way
is
made
plain
to
me
vesta
said
i
shall
go
that
way
if
my
duty
leads
me
to
you
again
you
will
be
my
master
sir
though
your
errand
here
was
a
severe
one
i
thank
you
for
your
sincerity
and
the
kind
consideration
you
seem
to
have
had
for
me
so
long
farewell
angel
vesta
honey
milburn
cried
may
i
kiss
you
not
now
she
answered
cold
as
superiority
and
interposing
her
hand
the
door
stood
wide
open
and
the
virgie
in
it
holding
the
entailed
hat
milburn
with
a
shudder
took
it
and
covered
himself
and
departed
chapter
x
master
in
the
kitchen
the
kitchen
had
been
a
scene
of
anything
but
culinary
peace
and
savor
during
the
long
visit
of
the
owner
of
the
hat
aunt
hominy
and
the
little
darkeys
had
made
three
stolen
visits
to
the
hall
to
peep
at
the
dreadful
thing
hanging
there
as
if
it
were
a
trap
of
some
kind
liable
to
drop
a
spring
and
catch
somebody
or
to
explode
like
a
mortar
or
torpedo
as
hour
after
hour
wore
on

not

all
they
started
to
take
another
peep
of
cupidity
and
awe
at
the
storied
hat
when
virgie
emerged
from
the
parlor
door
with
the
dreaded
article
in
her
hand
and
hanging
it
on
the
peg
came
with
superstitious
fear
and
relief
into
the
colonnade
aunt
hominy
hurried
her
to
the
kitchen
strewed
her
with
waved
a
rattle
of
snake
teeth
in
a
weazen
over
her
head
and
ended
by
pushing
a
sweet
piece
of
preserved
down
her
throat
did
it
hurt
ye
honey
inquired
aunt
hominy
with
her
eyes
full
of
excitement
referring
to
the
hat
i
do
know
aunty
virgie
answered
all
i
saw
was
miss
vessy
looking
away
from
me
as
if
she
might
be
going
to
be
ashamed
of
me
i
picked
the
thing
up
an
took
it
to
the
rack
an
all
i
know
is
it
smelled
old
like
some
of
the
chests
up
in
the
garret
when
we
lift
the
lid
and
peep
in
an
it
seems
as
if
they
were
dead
clothes
the
little
negroes
ned
vince
and
phillis
heard
this
with
shining
eyes
and
dived
their
heads
under
aunt
hominy
skirts
and
apron
while
the
old
woman
exclaimed
de
lord
a
massy
and
began
to
blow
what
she
called
on
the
girl
profaned
fingers
i
do
believe

anything
aunty
but
an
ugly
old
nasty
dead
folks
hat
exclaimed
virgie
he
just
wears
it
to
plague
people
he
was
drinking
tea
just
like
miss
vessy
but
i
thought
his
teeth
chattered
a
little
as
if
he
had
smelt
of
the
old
hat
and
it
give
him
a
chill
where
did
he
get
the
hat
aunt
hominy
roxy
asked
did
he
dig
it
up
somewhere
the
question
seemed
to
spur
the
cook
easy
invention
and
after
a
cunning
yet
credulous
look
up
and
down
the
large
kitchen
where
the
pale
light
at
the
windows
was
invisible
in
the
stronger
fire
beneath
the
great
stack
chimney
aunt
hominy
whispered
he
dug
dat
hat
up
in
ole
rehoboff
ruined
churchyard
he
foun
it
in
de
grave
but
you
said
this
afternoon
aunty
that
the
bad
man
gave
it
to
him
de
debbil
met
him
right
dar
insisted
aunt
hominy
in
dat
ole
obergrown
churchyard
whar
de
hymns
ob

used
to
be
raised
befo
de
debbil
got
it
he
says
to

make
you
de

whar

to
be

among

under

as
long
as

nobody
but
meshach
milburn
ever
prays
dar
he
goes
dar
sometimes
wid
his
on
he
head
an
prays
to
de
debbil
thus
does
an
unwonted
fashion
arouse
unwonted
visions
as
if
it
brought
to
the
present
day
the
phantoms
which
were
laid
at
rest
with
itself
and
they
walked
into
simple
minds
and
produced
superstition
there
aunt
hominy
never
was
stimulated
to
inventions
of
this
kind
but
she
immediately
absorbed
them
and
they
became
religious
beliefs
with
her
her
manner
highly
animated
by
her
terror
and
belief
produced
more
and
more
superstition
in
the
minds
of
the
girls
and
children
and
the
conversation
fell
off
the
little
negroes
wandering
hither
and
thither
unable
to
sleep
yet
unable
to
attract
sufficient
attention
from
any
one
till
judge
custis
who
had
been
waiting
for
hours
for
his
creditor
to
go
slipped
down
the
back
stairs
in
his
old
slippers
and
came
to
the
kitchen
among
the
colored
people
for
company
sake
his
fine
presence
and
familiar
if
superior
address
put
a
new
complexion
at
once
on
the
african
end
of
the
house
he
picked
up
all
the
children
by
twos
or
threes
woolled
them
chased
them
tossed
them
and
drove
the
lurid
images
of
aunt
hominy
mind
out
of
their
spirits
and
then
caught
the
two
young
girls
and
set
roxy
on
his
shoulder
and
caught
virgie
by
the
waist
and
finally
piled
them
on
aunt
hominy
who
ran
behind
her
and
he
bunched
all
the
children
upon
the
party
de

white

the

were
screaming
getting
into
the
riot
more
while
pretending
to
try
to
get
out
invading
the
judge
back
and
rubbing
their
clean
wool
into
his
whiskers
and
the
two
neat
servants
brought
up
like
white
children
in
his
family
were
not
unaccustomed
to
either
jovial
handling
or
petting
from
their
master
which
he
commonly
concluded
by
a
present
of
some
kind
old
woman
said
the
judge
to
aunt
hominy

sobriety
came
in
on
this
attempted
witticism
and
the
old
cook
saw
a
film
grow
into
the
judge
smiling
eyes

she
exclaimed
raising

all

in
while
the
children
crawled
around
the
judge
knees
setting
up
a
dismal
wail
to
see
him
sob
the
two
neat
house
girls
forgetting
every
contingency
to
themselves
sobbed
also
like
his
own
daughters
to
see
him
unmanned
but
aunt
hominy
only
felt
desperately
energetic
at
the
chance
to
cook
the
last
supper
of
the
custis
household
she
lighted
a
brand
of
pine
in
the
fire
and
started
one
of
the
stable
boys
up
a
ladder
by
its
light
to
ransack
the
and
in
a
very
little
while
both
a
chicken
and
a
bird
were
broiled
and
set
upon
the
upon
a
spotless
cloth
and
the
plume
of
celery
and
the
smoking
toast
in
velvet
cream
warmed
the
judge
nostrils
and
dried
his
tears
roxy
stood
behind
him
to
wait
upon
his
wishes
virgie
subdued
every
expression
of
grief
and
comforted
the
children
and
poor
aunt
hominy
with
silent
tears
streaming
down
her
cheeks
to
see
him
eat
and
suffer
kept
up
a
clatter
of
epicurean
talk
lest
he
might
turn
and
see
her
miserable
as
he
finished
his
meal
and
took
out
his
gold
and
felt
a
comfortable
joy
of
such
misery
and
sympathy
vesta
opened
the
door
and
said
papa
my
child
let
me
speak
with
you
judge
custis
rose
and
raised
his
hands
to
aunt
hominy
in
speechless
recognition
of
her
service
but
not
till
the
door
closed
behind
him
did
the
old
cook
cry
burst
through
her
quivering
lips
oh
chillen
chillen
he
never
eat
no
mo
like
dat
again
ole
meshach
measured
him
in
chapter
xi
dying
pride
at
the
termination
of
milburn
long
visit
vesta
had
gone
to
her
own
room
and
read
her
passage
in
the
bible
and
said
her
prayer
and
tried
to
think
but
the
day
application
had
been
too
great
to
leave
her
mind
its
morning
energy
when
health
which
is
so
much
of
decision
was
elastic
in
her
veins
and
brain
she
began
to
see
her
duty
loom
up
like
a
prodigious
thing
on
one
side
crowding
every
other
consideration
out
of
the
way
but
one
her
modesty
and
threatening
that
which
like
a
little
mouse
ran
around
and
around
her
mind
timorous
but
helpless
and
without
a
hole
of
escape
she
would
cease
to
be
a
maid
within
the
circuit
of
the
clock
or
forsake
her
family
and
drive
that
great
bloodhound
of
duty
over
the
threshold
of
her
ruined
home
in
the
one
case
lay
outward
devastation
the
red
eyes
of
parents
and
servants
who
had
not
slept
all
night
and
looked
at
her
as
their
obdurate
hostage
and
the
prying
constables
lodged
upon
the
premises
to
see
that
nothing
was
smuggled
out
the
ring
of
the
auctioneer
bell
and
the
fingering
of
boors
and
old
gossips
over
the
cherished
things
of
the
family
even
to
her
heirlooms
jewelry
and
hosiery
the
vast
old
house
a
hollow
barn
when
these
were
done
and
she
and
her
mother
visitors
at
the
jail
where
her
poor
father
looked
through
the
bars
and
bent
his
head
in
shame
then
the
servants
one
after
another
mounted
upon
the
block
the
old
gray
servitors
mocked
the
little
children
parted
like
calves
by
the
butcher
and
the
young
girls
feeling
the
desperate
apprehensions
of
abuse
and
violation
that
were
the
other
alternative
to
herself
with
whom
purity
was
like
the
whiteness
of
the
lily
prized
more
than
its
beauty
of
form
or
its
perfume
she
glanced
in
her
mirror
by
the
light
that
flamed
in
her
brazen
grate
and
saw
the
blushes
climb
like
flying
virgins
at
the
sack
of
towns
up
the
white
ramparts
of
her
neck
and
temples
the
form
which
had
altered
so
little
from
childhood
supple
and
straight
and
moulded
to
perfection
was
to
fall
like
the
young
in
the
august
hurricane
twisted
from
its
native
grove
the
breath
of
the
man
she
was
to
yield
her
life
to
irresistible
and
hot
as
that
storm
she
had
felt
already
when
he
held
her
for
a
moment
in
his
arms
in
the
transport
of
passion
and
heard
his
fearless
avowal
of
desire
to
marry
any
man
now
seemed
hard
to
marry
this
one
was
inexpressible
shame
and
at
the
thought
of
it
she
could
not
shed
a
tear
such
paralysis
came
over
her
she
had
read
of
the
recent
greek
revolution
where
elegant
ladies
of
scio
and
other
isles
of
the
ægean
sea
educated
in
the
best
seminaries
of
europe
had
been
sold
by
thousands
as
common
slaves
in
the
markets
of
constantinople
and
carried
to
their
estates
by
brutal
turks
with
all
the
gloating
anticipation
of
lust
and
tyranny
on
this
vivid
episode
started
a
procession
of
all
the
ages
of
women
who
had
been
the
sport
of
conquest
since
their
common
mother
eve
lost
paradise
by
her
simplicity
the
jewish
maidens
carried
to
babylon
the
gothic
virgins
dragged
at
the
of
the
moors
the
daughters
of
palestine
and
byzantium
consigned
to
arab
sensualists
and
made
to
follow
their
nomadic
tents
and
the
damsels
of
china
surrendered
by
their
parents
to
the
wild
kalmucks
to
be
beaten
and
starved
on
every
cold
plain
of
asia
till
life
was
laid
down
with
neither
hope
nor
fear
i
am
happier
than
millions
of
my
sex
vesta
said
my
captor
does
not
despise
me
at
least
perhaps
he
will
treat
me
kinder
than
i
think
and
give
me
time
to
draw
towards
him
without
this
deadly
pain
and
shame
then
she
almost
repented
of
her
hasty
decision
to
marry
this
night
instead
of
after
longer
acquaintance
which
milburn
no
doubt
would
have
granted
and
his
words
were
remembered
with
accusation
what
will
the
world
say
to
your
marriage
after
a
single
day
acquaintance
with
me
will
this
haste
not
be
repented
or
become
a
subject
of
reproach
to
you
was
it
too
late
to
recall
her
words
and
ask
for
delay
no
thought
vesta
i
am
to
keep
at
least
my
mind
maiden
and
chaste
instead
of
playing
the
unstable
coquette
with
that
i
will
not
let
him
begin
to
think
me
weak
and
changeful
already
to
see
if
there
was
the
least
glimmer
of
relief
from
this
marriage
vesta
crossed
to
her
mother
room
and
found
custis
with
her
head
wrapped
in
handkerchiefs
steeped
in
cologne
and
a
vial
of
laudanum
in
her
hand
and
in
a
condition
bordering
on
hysteria
mamma
said

custis
mockingly
what

he
had
i
would
like

in
the
woods
like

turk
among
his
barefooted

my
money
raked
and
scraped

my
poor

in
the

vesta
said
with
a
pale
resolution
that

through
her
veins
like
ice

your
jewels
custis

mamma
vesta
spoke
without
rebuke
only
with
a
sad
confirmed
feeling
of
her
destiny
i
could
be
capable
of
deceiving
any
of
those
gentlemen
if
i
could
so
heartlessly
leave
my
father
deceiving
custis
remarked
filling
her
palm
and
brow
with
the
cologne
what
is
man
whole
work
with
a
woman
but
deceit
to
court
her
for
her
money
to
kiss
her
into
taking
her
money
out
of
good
mortgages
and
putting
it
into
bog
iron
ore
to
tell
her
when
past
middle
life
that
she
has
nothing
to
live
upon
except
the
charity
of
the
public
or
her
reluctant
friends

this
for
an
experiment

went
to
her
mother
side
and
bathed
her
forehead

said

made
a
gesture
of
impatience
and
be
an
old
maid
she
blurted
that

insufferable
what

all
these
accomplishments
and
charms
for

a
husband
and
what

crazy
as
your
unprincipled
father

philanthropy

the
foundation
of
all
respectability
vesta
thought
to

be
so

then
justify
the
man
who
solicits
me
in
his
means
of
getting

kissed
her
daughter
and
moaned
about
her
poor
head
and
lost
marriage
portion
and
vesta
set
out
to
look
for
her
father
she
found
him
as
described
in
the
luxury
of
tears
and
squab
as
comfortable
among
his
negro
servants
as
in
the
state
legislature
or
at
the
head
of
society
and
they
wrapped
up
in
his
condescension
and
misfortunes
as
vesta
saw
the
curious
scene
of
such
patriarchal
democracy
in
the
old
kitchen
she
wondered
if
that
voluptuous
endowment
of
her
father
was
not
the
happy
provision
to
make
marriage
unions
tolerable
and
social
revulsions
philosophical
something
of
regret
that
she
had
not
more
of
the
animal
faintly
grew
upon
her
sad
smile
when
she
considered
that
wherever
her
father
went
he
made
welcome
and
warmth
as
she
already
felt
at
the
picture
of
him
after
parting
with
her
apathetic
mother
roxy
said
vesta
as
she
left
the
kitchen
do
you
go
up
to
my
mother
and
stay
with
her
all
this
night
make
your
spread
there
beside
her
bed
virgie
put
on
your
hood
and
carry
a
letter
for
me
i
will
write
it
in
the
library
she
sat
before
her
father
he
too
undecided
to
speak
and
seeing
by
her
fixed
expression
that
it
was
no
time
for
loquacity
she
sealed
the
letter
with
wax
and
virgie
coming
in
her
father
heard
the
direction
she
gave
with
curiosity
greater
than
his
embarrassment
take
this
to
rev
william
tilghman
give
it
to
him
only
and
see
that
he
reads
it
virgie
before
you
leave
him
if
he
asks
you
any
questions
tell
him
please
to
do
precisely
what
this
note
says
and
as
he
is
my
friend
not
to
disappoint
me
the
girl
steps
were
hardly
out
of
hearing
when
vesta
opened
the
drawer
of
the
and
took
out
a
package
of
papers
tied
with
a
string
she
unloosed
it
and
her
father
recognized
from
where
he
sat
his
notes
of
hand
and
mortgages
gracious
god
my
darling
exclaimed
judge
custis
how
came
you
by
those
papers
they
are
to
be
mine
father
in
one
hour
the
moment
they
become
mine
they
will
be
yours
why
vessy
said
the
judge
if
they
are
yours
even
to
keep
a
minute
the
shortest
way
with
them
is
up
the
chimney
he
made
a
stride
forward
to
take
them
from
her
hand
she
laid
them
in
her
lap
and
looked
at
him
so
calmly
that
he
stopped
you
may
burn
the
house
papa
she
said
it
is
still
your
own
but
these
papers
you
could
only
burn
by
a
crime
it
would
be
cheating
an
honorable
man
honorable
who
the
judge
exclaimed
he
who
is
to
be
my
husband
you
marry
meshach
milburn
shouted
the
judge
o
curse
of
god
not
him
yes
this
night
answered
vesta
i
respect
him
i
hold
these
obligations
by
his
trust
in
me
they
are
my
engagement
ring
judge
custis
raised
a
loud
howl
like
a
man
into
whom
a
nail
is
driven
and
fell
at
his
daughter
feet
and
clasped
her
knees
this
is
to
torture
me
he
cried
he
has
not
dared
to
ask
you
vesta
yes
and
my
word
is
passed
father
shall
that
word
the
word
of
a
custis
be
less
than
a
milburn
faith
by
the
love
he
bore
me
milburn
gave
me
these
debts
for
my
dower
a
rare
faith
in
one
so
prudent
if
i
do
not
marry
him
they
will
be
given
back
to
him
this
night
then
give
them
back
my
child
and
save
your
soul
and
your
purity
lest
i
live
to
be
cursed
with
the
sight
of
my
noble
daughter
shame
this
marriage
will
be
unholy
and
the
censure
to
follow
it
will
be
the
bankruptcy
of
more
than
our
estate
of
our
simple
fame
and
old
family
respect
we
have
friends
left
who
would
help
us
if
you
marry
milburn
they
will
all
despise
and
repudiate
us
i
do
not
believe
it
said
vesta
the
sense
and
courage
of
that
gentleman
he
is
a
gentleman
for
i
have
seen
him
and
a
gentleman
of
many
gifts
will
compel
respect
even
where
false
pride
and
family
pretension
appear
to
put
him
down
who
that
underrates
him
will
make
any
considerable
sacrifice
to
assist
us
your
sons
will
they
do
it
then
by
what
right
do
they
decide
my
marriage
choice
no
father
i
only
do
my
part
to
support
our
house
in
its
extremity
as
these
gentlemen
and
others
have
done
before
she
pointed
to
the
old
portraits
of
custises
on
the
wall
if
any
of
them
looked
dissatisfied
he
met
a
countenance
haughty
as
his
own
vesta
her
father
called
you
know
you
do
not
love
this
man
looking
back
a
minute
at
the
longing
in
his
face
which
now
wore
the
solicitude
of
personal
affection
she
melted
under
it
no
father
she
said
with
a
burst
of
tears
i
love
you
she
threw
her
arms
around
him
and
kissed
him
long
and
fondly
both
weeping
together
he
went
into
a
fit
of
grief
that
admitted
of
no
conversation
till
it
was
partly
spent
and
at
last
lay
with
his
gray
hairs
folded
to
her
heaving
bosom
where
the
compensation
of
his
love
made
her
sacrifice
more
precious
i
feel
that
i
am
doing
right
father
she
said
tenderly
till
now
i
have
had
my
doubts
no
other
young
heart
is
wronged
by
my
taking
this
step
i
have
never
been
engaged
and
it
now
seems
providential
as
i
could
not
then
have
gone
to
your
assistance
without
injuring
myself
and
another
and
your
debts
are
too
great
for
any
but
this
man
to
settle
them
your
life
has
been
one
long
sacrifice
for
me
and
not
a
cloud
has
darkened
above
me
till
this
day
giving
me
the
first
shower
of
sorrow
which
i
trust
will
refresh
my
soul
and
make
its
humility
grow
oh
father
it
would
rejoice
me
so
much
if
you
could
respond
to
my
sacrifice
with
a
better
life
god
help
me
i
will
he
sobbed
that
is
very
comforting
to
me
i
will
not
enumerate
your
omissions
dear
father
but
if
this
important
step
in
my
life
does
not
arrest
some
sad
tendencies
i
see
in
you
the
disappointment
may
break
me
down
intemperance
in
you
a
judge
a
gentleman
a
husband
and
a
father
is
a
deformity
worse
than
milburn
honest
unfashionable
hat
do
you
not
feel
happier
that
my
husband
is
not
to
be
a
drunkard
he
has
not
that
vice
thank
god
admitted
the
judge
be
his
better
example
father
for
i
hope
to
see
you
influence
him
to
be
kind
to
me
and
the
sight
of
you
walking
downward
in
his
view
will
degrade
me
more
than
bearing
his
name
or
sharing
his
eccentricities
oh
if
you
love
me
let
not
your
dear
soul
slide
out
of
the
knowledge
of
god
pray
for
me
dear
child
my
feet
are
slippery
and
my
knees
are
weak
begin
from
this
moment
to
lean
on
heaven
said
vesta
it
is
better
than
this
world
consideration
oh
what
would
strengthen
me
now
but
god
approval
though
i
go
into
a
captivity
i
dreamed
not
of
even
there
i
can
take
my
harp
beneath
the
willows
like
them
in
babylon
and
praise
my
maker
she
sat
at
her
piano
and
sang
the
hymn
the
young
consumptive
rev
eastburn
composed
in
her
grandmother
house
taking
it
from
the
episcopal
collection
o
holy
holy
holy
lord
bright
in
thy
deeds
and
in
thy
name
forever
be
thy
name
adored
thy
glories
let
the
world
proclaim
o
jesus
lamb
once
crucified
to
take
our
load
of
sins
away
thine
be
the
hymn
that
rolls
its
tide
along
the
realms
of
upper
day
o
holy
spirit
from
above
in
streams
of
light
and
glory
given
thou
source
of
ecstacy
and
love
thy
praises
ring
through
earth
and
heaven
as
her
voice
in
almost
supernatural
clearness
and
sweetness
filled
the
two
large
rooms
and
died
away
in
melody
she
rose
and
kissed
her
father
again
and
said
courage
love
we
shall
be
happy
still
a
knock
at
the
door
and
there
entered
the
young
clergyman
she
had
sent
for
a
boyish
person
with
a
fair
skin
easily
freckled
and
a
look
of
youthful
chivalry
under
his
sincere
christian
humility
william
vesta
spoke
i
did
not
expect
to
see
you
till
we
reached
the
church
but
sit
and
i
will
answer
your
questions
father
you
are
to
go
with
me
to
the
church
you
and
virgie
tilghman
is
to
marry
us
now
vesta
spoke
the
young
man
as
her
father
left
the
room
whom
are
you
going
to
marry
cousin
in
such
haste
as
this
did
you
have
the
church
made
ready
william
as
i
requested
i
did
the
sexton
is
there
now
lighting
the
fire
i
thought
you
were
loyal
as
ever
william
and
depended
upon
you
thanks
dear
friend
i
am
to
marry
meshach
milburn
at
nine
a
cloud
came
over
the
young
man
serene
face
though
his
features
retained
their
habitual
sweetness
i
can
marry
you
cousin
even
to
meshach
milburn
he
said
if
that
is
your
wish
why
do
you
marry
him
it
is
not
loyal
in
you
to
ask
william
but
i
will
give
you
this
answer
he
has
asked
me
he
is
also
devoted
and
rich
to
avoid
excitement
possibly
some
opposition
though
it
would
be
vain
we
are
to
be
married
without
further
notice
and
papa
is
to
give
me
away
silent
for
a
moment
the
young
rector
exclaimed
cousin
vesta
have
i
lived
to
see
you
a
mercenary
woman
has
this
asserted
wealth
found
you
cold
enough
to
want
it
when
love
has
been
so
generously
offered
you
by
almost
every
young
man
of
station
in
this
region
and
from
abroad
even
by
me
he
said
after
a
pause
the
scar
is
on
my
heart
yet
cousin
no
i
will
not
believe
such
a
thing
of
you
there
is
a
reason
back
of
the
fact
william
if
you
respected
me
as
you
once
said
you
ever
would
like
your
sister
you
would
not
add
this
night
the
weight
of
your
doubt
to
my
other
burdens
but
take
my
hand
with
all
the
strength
of
yours
and
lift
me
onward
i
will
said
the
rector
swallowing
a
dry
spot
in
his
throat
though
it
was
a
bitter
time
i
had
when
you
refused
me
cousin
the
pain
led
me
to
my
vows
at
the
altar
where
i
minister
and
i
have
had
the
assistance
of
your
beautiful
music
there
like
the
angel
i
seem
to
have
seen
reserved
for
me
in
place
of
you
sitting
at
your
side
and
i
know
that
this
marriage
is
on
your
part
pure
as
my
sister
no
further
will
i
inquire
what
penalty
you
are
paying
for
another
what
mystery
i
can
not
pierce
he
raised
his
hands
above
her
head
the
peace
of
god
that
passeth
understanding
abide
with
you
dear
sister
forever
he
went
out
with
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
but
hers
were
full
of
heavenly
light
feeling
his
benediction
to
be
righteous

rather
the

came
up
to
its
doors

was
the
for
all
the
grown
loiterers
in
princess
anne
had
been
in
the
greatest
activity
all
that
saturday
afternoon
since
it
was
reported
by
jack
wonnell
who
set
himself
to
be
a
spy
on
meshach
errand
that
the
had
disappeared
in
the
broad
mansion
of
judge
daniel
custis
jack
wonnell
had
a
worn
on
his
head
exposed
to
all
kinds
of
weather
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
fishing
in
these
and
never
owned
an
umbrella
in
his
life
he
lived
near
meshach
in
the
old
part
of
princess
anne
near
the
bridge
and
was
the
subject
of
the
scorn
and
contempt
as
tending
to
make
a
mutual
eccentricity
ridiculous
milburn
had
been
willing
to
be
hated
for
his
hat
but
jack
wonnell
made
all
unseasonable
hats
laughable
the
more
so
that
he
was
nearly
as
old
a
wearer
of
his
as
milburn
of
the
although
he
had
no
such
reasons
of
reverence
and
stern
consistency
as
his
rich
neighbor
he
seemed
to
have
in
his
own
mind
and
in
plain
people
a
better
defence
for
violating
the
standard
taste
of
dress
the
people
said
that
jack
wonnell
being
a
poor
man
could
not
buy
all
the
fashions
and
was
merely
wearing
out
a
bargain
that
he
knew
he
was
ridiculous
and
set
no
such
conceit
on
his
absurdity
as
that
grim
milburn
and
they
rather
enjoyed
his
playing
the
dromio
to
that
antipholus
and
turning
into
farce
the
comedy
of
meshach
error
jack
wonnell
had
partly
embraced
his
bargain
by
the
example
of
meshach
a
frivolous
unambitious
childish
fellow
amusing
people
obliging
people
running
errands
driving
stage
gardening
fishing
playing
with

he
had
been
impelled
to
bid
off
his
lot
of
old
hats
by
jimmy
phoebus
saying
jack
dirt
cheap
last
you
all
your
life
better
hats
than
old
meshach
milburn
you
drive
out
of
town
to
his
infinite
amusement
and
dignity
his
appearance
in
the
hats
attracted
the
severe
regard
of
milburn
and
set
the
little
town
on
a
grin
the
joke
went
on
till
jimmy
phoebus
judge
custis
and
some
others
prompted
jack
wonnell
with
the
promise
of
a
gallon
of
whiskey
to
ask
meshach
to
trade
the
for
the
the
intense
look
of
outrage
and
hate
with
the
accompanying
menace
his
townsman
returned
really
frightened
jack
and
he
had
prudently
avoided
milburn
ever
since
while
keeping
as
close
a
watch
upon
his
movements
and
whereabouts
as
upon
some
incited
liable
to
appear
anywhere
in
this
way
jack
wonnell
had
followed
meshach
to
the
corner
where
stood
judge
custis
brick
bank
which
of
late
had
done
little
discounting
and
from
the
open
space
between
it
and
the
in
its
rear
he
peeped
after
milburn
up
the
main
cross
street
called
prince
william
street
which
stopped
right
at
judge
custis
gate
there
in
the
quiet
of
early
afternoon
he
heard
the
knocker
sound
saw
the
door
open
and
beheld
the
entailed
hat
disappear
in
the
great
doorway
then
scarcely
believing
himself
wonnell
ran
back
to
the
tavern
and
exclaimed
may
i
be
struck
stone
dead
ef
ole
meshach
ai
gwyn
in
to
the
jedge
you
a
liar
said
jimmy
phoebus
promptly
catching
jack
by
the
back
of
the
neck
and
pushing
his
down
till
it
mashed
over
his
nose
and
eyes
what
do
you
mean
by
tellin
a
splurge
like
that
i
seen
him
jimmy
was
the
hero
smothered
cry
if
i
did
hope
i
may
die
what
did
he
go
there
for
i
ca
tell
jimmy
to
save
my
life
cried
phoebus
waving
his
old
straw
hat
itself
nearly
out
of
season
if
this
is
a
lie
jack
wonnell
i
make
you
eat
a
raw
fish
levin
to
levin
dennis
you
slip
up
by
custis
and
see
if
ole
meshach
hai
passed
around
the
fence
or
dropped
along
church
street
and
hid
in
the
graveyard
where
he
sometimes
goes
i
stay
yer
and
make
jack
wonnell
account
for
sech
lyin
levin
dennis
a
boyish
orphan
walked
up
the
cross
street
passing
church
lane
and
the
back
alley
and
slowly
turned
the
long
front
of
teackle
hall
and
went
out
the
parallel
street
towards
the
lower
bridge
on
the
deil
island
road
till
he
could
turn
and
see
the
three
buildings
of
teackle
hall
lifting
their
gables
and
to
his
sight
in
their
reverse
the
partly
stripped
trees
allowing
that
manorial
pile
to
stand
forth
in
much
of
its
length
and
imposing
proportions
lest
he
might
not
be
suspected
of
curiosity
levin
continued
on
to
the
bridge
at
manokin
landing
and
counted
the
geese
come
out
of
a
lawn
on
a
willowy
cape
there
and
take
to
water
like
a
fleet
of
white
schooners
he
ascended
the
rise
beyond
the
bridge
and
looked
over
to
see
if
meshach
might
have
taken
a
walk
down
the
road
then
returning
he
swept
the
back
view
of
princess
anne
from
the
low
bluff
of
cedars
on
another
inhabited
cape
on
the
right
which
bordered
the
manokin
marshes
to
the
vale
of
the
little
river
at
the
left
as
it
descended
between
meshach
storehouse
and
the
ancient
presbyterian
church
of
the
head
of
manokin
seated
among
its
gravestones
between
its
and
its
respectable
parsonage
manse
nothing
was
visible
of
the
owner
of
the
distinguishing
hat
so
levin
dennis
returned
more
slowly
around
the
north
wing
of
teackle
hall
looking
at
every
window
as
if
meshach
might
be
there
but
nothing
did
he
see
except
the
dog
which
to
levin
eye
appeared
uneasy
and
ran
out
of
the
gate
to
make
friends
with
him
so
turk
dennis
muttered
patting
the
dog
head
no
wonder
scared
boy
to
see
old
meshach
milburn
come
in
teackle
hall
according
to
rumor
was
built
at
the
close
of
the
revolutionary
war
by
an
uncle
or
of
judge
custis
who
came
from
virginia
somewhere
between
accomac
and
northampton
counties
and
went
into
shipbuilding
on
the
manokin
adding
some
privateering
and
banking
too
and
once
going
abroad
he
brought
back
from
some
ducal
residence
the
plan
of
teackle
hall
as
judge
custis
found
it
on
his
coming
into
the
property
it
was
nearly
two
hundred
feet
in
length
and
would
have
made
three
respectable
churches
standing
in
line
with
their
sharp
gables
to
the
front
the
bold
wings
connected
with
the
bolder
centre
by
habitable
curtains
or
colonnades
in
which
panels
of
slate
or
grained
stone
made
an
attic
story
above
the
lines
of
windows
and
lintels
and
sills
of
the
same
stone
with
high
keystones
capped
every
window
in
the
surface
of
the
whole
stately
block
all
built
of
brick
brought
over
in
vessels
from
the
western
shore
or
possibly
from
the
north
or
europe
and
painted
a
gray
stone
color
its
central
gable
had
deep
carved
eaves
and
a
to
shed
rain
and
a
large
circular
window
in
that
pediment
the
two
mighty
chimneys
of
that
centre
were
parallel
with
the
ridge
of
the
roof
and
rose
nearly
from
the
middle
of
the
two
opposite
slopes
bespeaking
four
great
fireplaces
below
and
a
flat
observatory
upon
the
roof
gave
views
of
portions
of
the
bay
on
clear
days
the
wings
of
teackle
hall
had
similar
but
lower
chimneys
astraddle
of
their
roofs
and
forest
trees
oak
gum
holly
and
pine
with
a
great
willow
and
some
tawny
cedars
and
bushes
of
rose
and
lilac
dotted
the
grassy
lawn
the
virginia
creeper
and
wild
ivy
climbed
here
and
there
to
the
upper
windows
and
a
tall
broad
panelled
doorway
opening
on
a
low
open
portico
platform
with
steps
seemed
to
say
to
visitors
men
of
port
and
consideration
come
in
this
way
but
inferiors
enter
by
some
of
the
smaller
doors
levin
dennis
who
had
never
sounded
that
knocker
though
he
had
often
taken
his
terrapins
to
the
kitchen
stared
in
concern
at
the
door
where
it
was
reported
meshach
milburn
had
gone
in
and
would
hardly
have
been
surprised
if
that
intruder
had
now
appeared
at
one
of
the
three
deep
windows
over
the
door
with
a
firebrand
in
his
hand
levin
muttered
to
himself
rich
folks
i
reckon
must
make
a
trade
maybe
it
hosses
maybe
not
i
know
it
ai
hats
he
then
turned
down
to
the
episcopal
church
only
a
square
from
teackle
hall
and
on
a
street
between
it
and
the
main
street
though
in
a
retired
situation
its
front
turned
from
the
town
and
looking
over
the
fields
and
farms
like
a
good
pastor
who
is
warming
at
the
fire
with
his
hands
behind
him
a
long
low
edifice
of
british
bricks
with
its
semicircular
choir
next
the
street
and
adjoining
the
choir
a
spire
of
more
modern
brickwork
built
up
to
an
open
bell
cupola
and
open
ribbed
dome
also
of
brick
tipped
with
a
gilded
cross
the
ivy
was
greenly
matted
all
round
the
choir
and
ran
along
the
side
of
the
church
where
levin
dennis
walked
under
four
tall
windows
of
stained
and
wired
glass
till
he
came
to
the
end
gable
or
front
of
the
church
standing
in
unworldly
contemplation
of
the
graveyard
and
the
back
fields
there
since
the
stamp
act
congress
or
when
princess
anne
was
not
half
a
century
old
the
old
church
had
taken
its
stand
backed
up
to
the
town
recluse
from
its
gossip
between
its
tall
round
doors
with
little
like
spectacles
let
into
their
panels
the
ivy
vine
arose
in
form
like
the
print
of
the
crucified
reaching
out
its
stems
and
tendrils
wide
of
the
one
glorified
window
in
the
gable
in
whose
red
dyes
glimmered
the
triumph
of
a
bloody
countenance
the
mossy
walls
often
scraped
the
mossified
pavement
the
greenish
tombs
of
marble
under
the
maples
and
firs
showed
the
effect
of
shade
solitude
and
humidity
upon
all
things
of
brick
in
this
climate
where
wood
was
already
rising
into
favor
as
building
material
but
to
the
detraction
of
picturesqueness
and
all
the
appearance
of
antiquity
no
sign
of
the
unpopular
townsman
was
to
be
seen
anywhere
but
as
levin
dennis
peeked
around
the
foliage
in
the
yard
he
beheld
a
man
he
had
never
observed
before
and
of
a
tall
bearded
suspicious
and
ruffianly
exterior
lying
flat
on
the
top
of
a
memorial
vault
with
his
head
and
feet
half
concealed
in
some
cedar
brambles
hallo
dennis
shouted
what
do
you
hallo
for
spoke
the
man
do

never
come
to
a
churchyard

till
i
knows
i
has
some
sins
what
air

prowlin
about
the
church
then
fur
anyhow
demanded
the
stranger
standing
up
in
his
boots
into
which
his
trousers
were
tucked
and
he
stood
such
a
straight
lithe
giant
of
a
man
that
levin
saw
he
could
never
run
away
even
if
the
intruder
meant
to
chew
him
up
right
there
i
ai
a
prowlin
friend
answered
levin
dennis
i
was
jess
a
lookin

the
man
taking
a
step

of

long
legs
why
i
was
jess
a
follerin
a
man
that

not

but

the
man

up

dennis
this
time
and
stood
over
him
like
a

a
sucker
yer

pulling
an
old
straw
article

by
a
stiffy
dennis
looked
up
laughing
though
not
all
at
ease
but
his
amiable
want
of
either
intelligence
or
fear
which
belong
near
together
made
his
most
natural
reply
to
the
pertinacious
intruder
a
disarming
grin
no
man
dennis
said
it
was
a
hat
on

of

he
was
too
fond
levin
led
the
way
to
the
washington
tavern
where
there
was
a
material
addition
to
the
attendance
since
jimmy
phoebus
had
called
to
every
that
meshach
milburn
on
the
testimony
of
jack
wonnell
had
actually
been
and
gone
and
disappeared
in
judge
custis
doorway
and
nearly
a
dozen
townsfolks
were
now
discussing
the
why
and
wherefore
when
suddenly
levin
dennis
came
out
of
church
street
with
a
man
over
six
feet
high
of
a
prodigious
pair
of
legs
and
arms
nearly
as
long
with
a
cold
challenging
yet
restless
pair
of
blue
eyes
and
with
beard
and
hair
coarse
and
stringy
the
free
negro
samson
hat
being
a
little
way
off
was
observed
to
cast
a
beaming
glance
of
admiration
at
the
athletic
proportions
of
the
stranger
who
looked
as
if
he
might
shoulder
an
ox
or
outrun
a
horse
hallo
exclaimed
jimmy
phoebus
looking
the
stranger
over
boldly
yet
with
indifference
at
last
you
cuttin
a
splurge
levin
too
where
meshach
ca
see
no
sign
of
him
jimmy
guess
jack
wonnell
hit
it
an
gone
in
the
jedge
mebbe
he
buyin
of
jedge
custis
niggers
this
gentleman
business
jimmy
phoebus
himself
no
slight
specimen
of
a
man
gave
another
glance
at
the
stranger
from
the
black
cherries
of
his
eyes
and
apparently
no
better
satisfied
with
the
inspection
made
no
sign
of
acquaintance
whoever
ai
too
nice
to
drink
with
a
nigger
buyer
said
the
man
independently
can
come
in
and
set
up
his
drink
with
my
redge
for
and
just
rotten
with
flush
there
was
a
pause
for
somebody
to
take
the
initiative
but
jimmy
phoebus
turning
his
big
broad
greekish
face
and
small
forehead
on
the
stranger
remarked
i
never
tuk
a
drink
with
a
nigger
buyer
yit
and
by
smoke
i
reckon
i
too
old
to
begin
the
man
stopped
and
measured
jimmy
up
in
his
eye
humph
he
said
with
a
sneer
you
look
to
be
a
little
more
than
half
nigger

i
run

git
my
price
for
you
no
doubt
of
it
whatever
as
fur
as
you
concerned
said
jimmy
unexcited
while
the
man
pushed
levin
dennis
in
towards
the
bar
either
the
new
movement
of
meshach
milburn
or
the
example
of
the
strange
man
set
princess
anne
in
a
tipsy
condition
that
day
the
stranger
was
full
of
money
and
treating
indiscriminately
and
the
pavement
before
the
hotel
was
continually
beset
with
the
loiterers
and
the
bar
took
money
and
spread
mischief
so
when
an
hour
after
dark
the
unpopular
townsman
avoiding
the
crowd
passed
by
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
nearest
his
own
lodging
one
of
the
loudest
and
most
unanimous
yells
he
had
ever
heard
in
his
experience
rang
out
from
the
washington
tavern
old
meshach
loose
laugh
on
thought
meshach
till
now
i
never

the
meaning
of
them

felt
confirmed
in
his
idea
to
be

in
the
raleigh
tile
and
when

said

by

marster
before
nine
milburn
and
his
negro
left
the
old
store
by
the
town
bridge
and
passing
by
the
river
lane
called
front
street
into
church
street
walked
back
of
the
hotel
avoiding
its
triflers
and
reached
the
church
in
a
few
minutes
unobserved
the
long
windows
shed
some
light
however
but
as
it
was
saturday
night
this
was
attributed
by
the
few
who
noticed
it
to
preparations
for
the
next
sabbath
morning
before
setting
out
samson
hat
observing
his
employer
to
shake
a
trifle
asked
him
if
a
dram
of
whiskey
would
not
be
proper
no
boy
this
is
a
wedding
without
wine
i
shall
need
all
my
wits
to
find
my
manners
he
entered
the
church
and
found
it
warmed
and
the
minister
already
present
in
his
surplice
kneeling
alone
at
the
altar
tilghman
arose
with
his
youthful
face
very
pale
and
tears
upon
his
cheeks
and
seeing
his
neglected
parishioner
and
the
came
down
the
aisle
milburn
he
said
extending
his
hand
i
hope
to
congratulate
after
this
ceremony
a
bridegroom
and
one
who
will
take
the
rare
charge
which
has
fallen
to
him
in
tender
keeping
my
endeavor
shall
be
to
love
you
sir
if
you
will
let
me
miss
vesta
is
the
priestess
of
princess
anne
and
if
you
take
her
from
our
sight
and
hearing
even
god
ministrations
in
this
church
will
seem
hollow
i
fear
to
me
they
would
said
milburn
though
from
no
disrespect
to
our
pastor
you
have
been
a
faithful
parishioner
resumed
tilghman
during
my
brief
labor
here
as
in
my
boyhood
when
i
little
dreamed
i
should
fill
that
desk
you
know
perhaps
that
it
was
from
the
hopeless
love
of
my
cousin
custis
i
fled
to
god
for
consolation
and
he
made
me
his
humble
minister
i
have
heard
so
said
milburn
or
rather
i
have
seen
so
pardon
my
mentioning
a
subject
so
irrelevant
to
you
sir
but
though
i
have
surrendered
every
vain
emotion
for
my
cousin
her
happiness
is
a
part
of
my
religion
and
this
sudden
conclusion
of
her
marriage
about
which
i
have
asked
only
one
question
has
urged
me
to
throw
myself
upon
your
sympathy
what
do
you
ask
william
tilghman
no
matter
your
request
is
granted
how
have
i
won
your
favor
the
young
rector
asked
somewhat
surprised
milburn
mechanically
picked
his
hat
from
a
pew
and
held
it
a
little
way
up
you
were
the
only
boy
in
this
village
who
never
cried
after
this
hat
then
it
was
probably
overlooked
by
me
i
was
like
the
other
boys
mischievous
before
my
spirits
had
been
depressed
by
unhappy
love
and
i
did
not
know
i
was
any
exception
to
their
habits
it
was
grateful
to
see
that
exception
said
milburn
hooted
people
make
fine
distinctions
oh
milburn
forgive
the
boys
they
are
made
for
laughter
and
little
causes
excite
it
like
dogs
to
bark
from
health
and
exercise
scarcely
more
than
that
the
request
i
make
is
to
let
me
be
your
friend
because
i
have
been
your
wife
frankness
becomes
my
calling
and
i
think
you
need
friendly
cordial
surroundings
to
bring
out
your
usefulness
and
give
you
the
freedom
that
will
take
constraint
out
of
your
family
life
and
without
diminishing
your
good
sensibilities
dispel
any
morbid
ones
this
will
open
a
way
for
vesta
to
see
her
domestic
career
which
otherwise
might
become
so
rapidly
contracted
as
to
disappoint
you
both
you
have
seen
her
the
idol
of
her
wide
circle
free
as
a
bird
indulged
by
her
kind
and
by
providence
also
till
joy
and
grace
beauty
and
health
faith
and
hope
live
abundant
in
her
and
you
are
the
beneficiary
of
it
all
her
society
hereafter
you
must
control
may
i
become
your
friend
and
let
my
love
for
your
wife
recommend
me
to
your
confidence
as
you
to
mine
and
to
my
prayers
have
i
another
friend
already
exclaimed
milburn
his
voice
quivering
what
wealth
she
brings
me
never
known
before
william
you
will
be
ever
welcome
to
me
they
clasped
hands
upon
it
and
old
samson
hat
sitting
back
was
heard
to
chuckle
aloud
such
a
warming
laugh
that
meshach
response
to
it
in
a
sudden
pallid
shivering
seemed
slightly
out
of
keeping
he
was
recalled
however
by
the
entrance
of
judge
custis
with
his
daughter
and
her
maid
virgie
vesta
was
very
pale
but
neither
shrinking
nor
negative
on
the
contrary
she
supported
her
father
rather
than
received
his
support
and
milburn
saw
the
judge
worn
helpless
face
with
the
pride
faded
from
it
and
pity
for
his
daughter
absorbing
every
other
feeling
of
depression
he
wore
his
best
cloth
suit
with
the
coat
tails
falling
to
his
knees
behind
the
body
cut
square
to
the
hips
and
the
collar
raised
high
upon
his
stock
of
white
enamelled
english
leather
his
vest
exposed
his
of
crystal
and
gilt
and
a
ruffle
ironed
by
roxy
slender
hands
with
nimble
touches
parted
down
the
middle
like
sea
foam
on
shell
and
similar
ruffles
at
the
wrists
were
clasped
by
chain
buttons
of
pearl
and
silver
his
vest
was
of
figured
marseilles
stuff
and
gaiters
of
the
same
material
partly
covered
his
shoes
and
his
heavy
seal
with
his
coat
of
arms
upon
it
fell
from
a
pale
ribbon
at
his
fob
debtor
though
he
was
and
answering
at
the
bar
of
the
church
to
a
heavy
personal
and
family
judgment
his
large
and
flowing
lines
of
body
deeply
cut
chin
full
eyes
and
natural
height
and
grace
of
stature
made
him
a
marked
and
noble
presence
anywhere
vesta
custis
dropping
off
a
mantle
of
blue
velvet
at
a
touch
of
her
maid
stood
in
a
party
dress
of
white
silk
the
neck
shoulders
and
arms
bare
and
as
she
halted
a
minute
in
the
aisle
virgie
struck
the
cloth
sandals
from
her
mistress
white
slippers
of
silk
and
removing
her
hood
of
cloth
a
veil
of
white
fell
to
her
train
the
dingy
light
from
the
lamps
of
gathered
like
poor
children
marvelling
eyes
around
the
pair
of
diamonds
in
her
delicately
moulded
but
alert
and
generous
ears
her
fine
gold
twice
dependent
from
her
neck
disappeared
in
the
snowy
mould
of
her
bosom
on
whose
heaving
drift
swam
a
and
blossom
each
with
a
leaf
her
father
picture
in
a
careful
miniature
set
in
pearls
lay
higher
on
her
breast
fastened
by
a
pearl
necklace
her
hands
were
covered
with
white
gloves
and
her
arms
were
without
ornament
her
hair
dropping
in
dark
ringlets
around
her
forehead
and
temples
was
combed
upward
farther
back
and
then
gathered
around
a
pearl
comb
in
high
braids
and
the
plentiful
loops
drooped
to
her
shoulder
milburn
glanced
at
the
treasures
of
her
peerless
bodily
charms
never
till
now
revealed
to
his
sight
and
their
splendor
almost
made
him
afraid
never
had
he
been
at
a
theatre
a
ball
or
anywhere
from
which
he
could
have
foreseen
a
neck
and
bosom
sculptured
like
these
and
arms
as
white
as
the
limbs
of
the
and
warmed
with
and
modesty
her
lips
parted
and
red
her
great
rich
eyes
a
goddess
might
have
commanded
through
with
their
eyebrows
of
like
entrances
to
the
caves
of
the
cumæan
sibyl
her
small
head
borne
as
easily
upon
her
neck
as
a
dove
upon
a
sprig
all
flashed
upon
milburn
thrilled
yet
flinching
soul
as
the
revelation
of
a
divinity
as
she
stepped
forward
he
spoke
to
her
with
that
bold
instinct
or
ecstasy
she
had
observed
when
she
first
addressed
him
in
her
house
ten
hours
before
you
have
dressed
yourself
for
me
he
said
sir
such
as
i
could
command
upon
this
necessity
i
thought
to
do
you
honor
with
for
to
look
so
beautiful
what
can
i
say
you
are
very
lovely
it
is
gracious
of
you
to
praise
me
shall
we
wait
or
are
you
ready
he
gave
her
his
hand
unable
to
speak
again
and
she
was
calm
enough
to
notice
that
his
hand
was
now
hot
as
if
he
had
fever
her
father
at
her
side
reached
out
also
and
took
the
bridegroom
other
hand
milburn
he
said
huskily
this
is
no
work
of
mine
my
daughter
has
my
consent
only
because
it
is
her
will
the
nobler
to
me
for
that
milburn
spoke
with
his
countenance
strangely
flushed
what
shall
we
do
my
lady
give
me
your
arm
not
that
one
this
is
right
have
you
brought
a
ring
sir
yes
he
drew
from
his
vest
pocket
a
little
lean
gold
ring
worth
hardly
half
a
dollar
it
was
my
poor
mother
he
said
without
another
word
she
walked
forward
her
arm
drawing
him
on
virgie
following
and
her
father
bringing
up
the
rear
samson
hat
feeling
uneasy
at
being
awarded
no
part
in
the
ceremony
slipped
up
the
aisle
as
far
as
the
big
stove
in
the
middle
of
the
church
behind
which
he
ducked
his
body
but
kept
his
head
and
faculties
in
the
centre
of
the
events
tilghman
had
preceded
them
in
his
surplice
and
taking
his
place
at
the
altar
with
his
countenance
pale
as
death
he
read
the
exordium
in
an
altered
voice
dearly
beloved
we
are
gathered
together
here
and
in
the
face
of
this
company
to
join
together
this
man
and
this
woman
in
holy
matrimony
what
is
here
thought
vesta
not
alone
these
poor
negroes
and
my
father
no
i
feel
behind
me
looking
on
the
generations
of
our
pride
and
helpless
ease
the
worthy
younger
suitors
i
have
been
too
exacting
and
particular
to
see
the
consideration
and
merits
of
the
golden
hours
i
might
have
improved
my
mind
in
with
brilliant
opportunities
i
was
not
jealous
of
and
which
will
be
mine
no
more
because
i
had
not
trimmed
my
virgin
lamp
and
so
i
slept
away
my
girlhood
till
now
i
awaken
at
the
cry
bridegroom
cometh
and
i
behold
yes
i
have
been
a
foolish
virgin
and
am
surprised
when
my
fate
is
here
perhaps
my
guardian
angel
also
stands
behind
me
the
cross
advanced
that
i
must
take
my
crown
concealed
but
somewhere
midway
of
this
journey
of
life
she
may
give
it
to
me
and
say
done
this
thought
milburn
with
swimming
head
gathered
to
see
me
marry
what
company
i
seem
to
feel
besides
these
negroes
my
sole
spectators
the
populous
forest
peering
on
the
barefoot
generations
the
illiterate
broods
the
instinctive
parents
the
sandy
graves
they
give
forth
my
lost
tribe
and
all
cry
at
me
leave
us
proud
one
despiser
go
yet
there
is
one
i
see
pure
as
my
bride
white
as
my
captive
bosom
her
soul
all
in
her
believing
eyes
and
saying
my
son
it
is
a
woman
like
me
that
has
come
into
your
life
and
her
heart
is
very
tender
and
by
your
mother
dying
love
be
kind
to
the
poor
stranger
you
have
bought
he
answered
i
will
aloud
and
it
seemed
almost
a
miraculous
coincidence
that
it
was
a
response
to
the
minister
question
till
he
heard
the
corresponding
inquiry
put
to
his
bride
in
the
clergyman
low
but
gentlest
tones
wilt
thou
obey
him
and
serve
him
love
honor
and
keep
him
in
sickness
and
in
health
and
forsaking
all
others
keep
thee
only
unto
him
so
long
as
ye
both
shall
live
i
will
spoke
the
judge
daughter
clear
as
music
and
the
judge
drew
a
long
deep
sigh
saturated
with
tears
as
if
from
the
deepest
wells
of
grief
he
could
not
distinctly
answer
as
he
joined
her
hand
to
the
minister
the
minister
lost
his
office
and
speech
for
a
moment
joining
her
hand
to
the
bridegroom
the
burst
into
a
wail
she
could
not
control
and
only
vesta
stood
calm
as
her
bridegroom
putting
her
cool
moist
hand
in
his
palm
of
fire
and
waited
to
repeat
the
deliberate
language
when
both
had
made
this
solemn
promise
she
reached
for
the
little
ring
and
gave
it
to
her
old
lover
the
minister
and
virgie
loosed
her
glove
tilghman
his
tears
silently
falling
upon
his
book
passed
the
ring
to
meshach
and
saw
its
tiny
circle
hoop
her
white
finger
round
no
bigger
than
a
straw
yet
formidable
as
the
martyr
chain
his
prayers
were
said
with
deep
feeling
and
he
pronounced
them
man
and
wife
then
shaking
meshach
hand
he
said
with
his
boyish
countenance
bright
as
faith
could
make
it
my
friend
may
i
take
my
kiss
meshach
nodded
his
head
but
his
face
was
like
a
ball
of
fire
and
he
hardly
knew
what
was
asked
tilghman
kissed
vesta
saying
cousin
your
husband
is
my
friend
and
love
and
friendship
both
surround
you
now
may
your
happiness
be
like
your
goodness
securest
when
you
surmount
difficulties
like
those
birds
that
can
not
float
at
perfect
grace
till
they
have
struggled
above
the
clouds
may
i
kiss
you
now
milburn
said
gazing
with
a
wild
look
upon
her
rich
eyes
as
she
obediently
raised
her
lips
a
strange
warm
husky
breath
not
natural
nor
even
passionate
came
from
his
nostrils
the
judge
looking
at
this
no
pleasing
scene
to
him
the
fairest
custis
in
two
hundred
years
being
devoured
before
his
sight
exclaimed
within
his
soul
is
meshach
drinking
his
eyes
look
fiery
so
after
kissing
his
daughter
also
and
saying
may
god
reward
you
with
triumphs
and
compensation
beyond
our
fears
the
judge
said
milburn
i
suppose
in
the
sudden
conclusion
of
this
union
you
have
made
no
arrangements
as
to
where
you
will
go
so
come
of
course
to
teackle

and
make

hour
milburn
said
meantime
i
require
something
at
my
warehouse
and
as
it
is
yet
early
in
the
night
may
i
leave
you
a
little
while
she
bowed
her
head
again
and
while
they
proceeded
towards
the
lingering
there
samson
took
the
opportunity
to
seize
both
of
virgie
hands
virgie
he
exclaimed

virgie
indignant
but
fluttered
at
her
first
real
proposal
and
from
one
of
the
richest
men
of
her
color
in
princess
anne
hastened
to
tie
on
her
young
mistress
and
as
they
all
stepped
from
the
happy
old
church
where
vesta
voice
had
so
often
pierced
in
her
flights
of
harmony
to
a
bliss
that
seemed
to
carry
her
soul
like
a
lark
to
heaven
gate
that
singing
still
dost
soar
and
soaring
ever
singest
she
saw
fall
upon
the
pavement
of
the
churchyard
the
long
preposterous
hat
of
the
bridegroom
oh
what
will
he
do
with
that
hat
now
that
he
has
married
me
vesta
thought
will
he
continue
to
afflict
me
with
it
her
heart
sank
down
so
that
she
felt
relieved
when
he
kissed
her
again
at
the
and
saying
i
will
come
soon
darling
went
with
his
man
into
princess
anne
is
your
buggy
ready
harnessed
samson
his
master
asked
when
they
turned
the
corner
yes
marster
at
this
moment
a
large
crowd
of
men
comprising
all
the
idle
population
in
town
as
well
as
many
bacchanalians
from
the
country
and
coasts
some
standing
before
the
tavern
others
on
the
opposite
sidewalks
or
gathered
on
the
corner
seeing
the
hatted
figure
of
meshach
rise
against
the
moonlight
raised
the
scattering
cry
finally
deepening
into
a
yell
of
man
with
the
hat
loose
three
cheers
for
old
hat
with
a
minute
irresolution
as
if
hesitating
to
go
through
the
crowd
milburn
turned
into
the
main
street
crossed
it
and
continued
down
the
opposite
sidewalk
on
the
same
side
with
his
domicile
the
jeers
and
jests
still
continuing
dar
rum
a
workin
in
dis
town
all
arternoon
marster
his
faithful
negro
said
eber
sence
dat
long
man
come
in
from
de
churchyard
wid
levin
dennis
look
out
marster
he
had
scarcely
spoken
when
three
men
were
seen
to
bar
the
way
two
of
them
drunk
the
third
ugly
with
drink
emerging
from
a
groggery
that
stood
across
the
street
from
the
tavern
where
further
beverage
had
been
denied
them
the
first
was
jack
wonnell
he
hiccoughed
cried
and
slunk
behind
a
the
second
man
was
levin
dennis
hardly
able
to
stand
and
he
sat
down
on
the
groggery
step
smiling
up
idiotically
the
third
man
rising
like
a
giant
out
of
his
boots
with
his
arms
swaying
like
loose
grapevines
and
his
bearded
face
streaked
with
tobacco
drippings
looking
insolence
and
contempt
brought
the
flat
of
one
hand
fairly
down
on
the
crown
of
milburn
surprising
tile
with
the
words
halloo
yer
goosecap
hocus
that
cady
old
gripefist
the
hat
age
being
against
it
wilted
down
on
meshach
eyes
and
the
heedless
stroke
unconsciously
powerful
staggered
him
samson
who
had
drunk
in
the
giant
qualifications
with
an
admiration
immediately
drew
off
seeing
his
master
insulted
and
struck
the
tall
stranger
a
blow
with
his
fist
the
man
reeled
rallied
and
sought
to
grapple
with
samson
that
skilful
pugilist
bent
his
knees
slided
his
shoulders
back
and
avoiding
the
clutch
raised
and
threw
his
trunk
forward
with
the
blow
studied
well
and
planted
his
knuckles
in
the
white
man
eyes
the
tall
ruffian
went
down
as
from
a
bolt
of
lightning
milburn
saw
all
this
happen
in
a
minute
of
time
and
his
eye
looking
for
something
to
defend
himself
dropped
on
the
brick
pier
under
the
groggery
steps
where
levin
dennis
sat
stupefied
by
the
scene
a
brick
in
the
pier
was
loose
and
milburn
stepped
towards
it
in
this
small
interval
the
hardy
stranger
had
recovered
himself
and
staggered
to
his
feet
and
had
drawn
a
the
ruffian
oly
you
he
bellowed
knocked
down
by
a
nigger
too
hell
have
you
then
as
he
darted
forward
he
described
a
rapid
circle
backward
and
downward
with
the
knife
aiming
to
turn
it
through
samson
bowels
which
he
would
have
done
that
valorous
servant
being
without
defence
and
not
so
much
as
a
pebble
of
stone
lying
on
the
bare
plain
of
the
soil
to
give
him
aid
had
not
meshach
wresting
the
loose
brick
from
the
pier
aimed
it
at
the
corresponding
exposed
portion
of
the
assassin
body
and
struck
him
full
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
the
man
eyes
rolled
and
he
fell
like
one
his
dirk
sticking
in
the
sidewalk
let
him
lie
there
said
meshach
contemptuously
no
danger
of
such
a
dog
dying
if
there
is
time
he
shall
mend
in
the
jail
take
to
your
buggy
boy
and
keep
out
of
the
way
the
negro
needed
no
warning
as
the
impiety
of
striking
a
white
man
was
forbidden
in
a
larger
book
than
the
bible
the
book
of
ignorance
he
disappeared
through
the
houses
and
was
a
mile
out
of
princess
anne
driving
fast
before
the
new
man
had
raised
his
head
from
the
ground
where
is
the
nigger
he
gasped
his
paleface
painted
by
his
bloodshot
eyes
what
kind
of
coves
are
you
to
let
a
black
bloke
fight
a
white
man
i
cut
his
heart
out
before
i
tip
the
town
he
looked
around
on
the
crew
which
had
crossed
over
from
the
tavern
meshach
had
vanished
in
his
store
at
the
descent
of
the
road
jimmy
phoebus
was
the
only
one
to
speak
nigger
buyer
he
said
if
you
are
around
this
town
from
now
till
midnight
or
after
midnight
sunday
night
ole
meshach
milburn
will
have
you

hokey
pokey
you
struck
the
ark
of
the
lord
this
time
ole
milburn
entailed
hat
take
my
advice
an
travel
the
man
washed
his
face
at
the
tavern
pump
turned
the
bank
corner
and
disappeared
in
the
night
towards
teackle
hall
chapter
xiii
shadow
of
the
tile
as
vesta
and
her
father
stepped
over
the
sill
of
teackle
hall
it
seemed
very
dear
yet
somewhat
dread
to
them
being
reclaimed
again
but
at
the
penalty
of
a
new
member
of
the
family
and
he
an
intruder
to
the
library
vesta
and
her
father
went
and
he
threw
some
wood
upon
the
low
fire
and
lighted
the
lamp
and
candles
then
turning
he
took
his
daughter
in
his
arms
and
sobbed
bitterly
repeating
over
the
words
what
shall
i
do
o
what
shall
i
do
she
also
yielded
to
the
luxury
of
grief
but
was
speechless
till
he
said
my
darling
i
have
dreamed
of
your
many
a
time
but
it
was
not
like
this
music
and
joy
a
handsome
youthful
bridegroom
our
whole
connection
gathered
here
from
the
army
and
navy
from
south
west
and
north
and
all
happy
except
poor
daniel
custis
about
to
lose
his
child
your
child
is
not
to
go
vesta
whispered
is
not
that
a
comfort
i
do
not
know
is
it
my
pure
poor
child
had
i
seen
you
waste
with
consumption
day
by
day
like
a
dying
with
its
clusters
fewer
every
year
till
it
deadened
to
the
root
i
could
have
wept
in
heavenly
sympathy
and
learned
from
you
the
way
i
have
not
walked
but
in
your
flower
to
be
a
forester
plucking
stripped
from
my
stem
and
trodden
in
the
sand
your
pride
reduced
your
tastes
unheeded
your
heart
dragged
into
the
wigwam
of
a
savage
and
made
to
consult
his
maudlin
will
oh
what
shall
i
do
i
do
not
fear
my
husband
like
that
vesta
said
opening
his
arms
my
mind
i
think
he
will
rather
raise
to
serious
things
for
which
i
have
some
desire
though
i
fear
no
talent
papa
something
tells
me
that
this
old
life
we
have
led
easy
and
happy
comfortable
and
independent
is
passing
away
our
family
race
must
learn
the
new
lessons
of
the
age
if
we
would
not
see
it
retired
and
obscure
is
that
not
so
i
fear
it
is
god
truth
my
darling
the
life
we
have
led
is
only
a
remnant
of
colonial
or
rather
of
provincial
dignity
to
which
the
nature
of
this
republican
government
is
hostile
tobacco
which
was
once
our
money
is
disappearing
from
this
shore
and
wheat
and
corn
we
can
not
grow
like
the
rich
young
west
which
is
pouring
them
out
through
the
canal
the
late
governor
clinton
lived
to
open
money
is
becoming
a
thing
and
not
merely
a
name
and
it
captures
every
other
thing
land
distinction
talent
family
even
beauty
and
purity
the
man
you
married
understands
the
art
of
money
and
we
do
not
then
are
we
not
impostors
papa
if
we
assume
to
be
so
much
better
than
our
real
superiors
surely
we
must
persevere
in
those
things
the
age
demands
and
excel
in
them
to
sustain
our
pride
yes
if
the
breed
is
gamecock
it
will
accept
any
challenge
not
only
war
and
politics
but
mechanics
anything
papa
if
you
can
see
these
things
that
are
to
be
so
clearly
why
can
you
not
take
the
wise
steps
to
plant
your
family
on
the
safe
side
ah
we
virginians
were
always
the
best
statesmen
but
we
died
poor
having
no
manual
craft
slight
bookkeeping
and
unlimited
capacity
for
office
we
foresaw
everything
but
the
humiliation
of
ourselves
and
that
we
hardly
admitted
when
it
had
come
so
much
were
we
flattered
by
our
philosophic
intellects
our
newest
amusement
is
to
expound
the
constitution
to
them
who
are
doing
too
well
under
it
although
our
fathers
who
made
it
like
jefferson
and
madison
died
only
yesterday
overwhelmed
with
debts
and
poor
monroe
is
run
away
to
new
york
they
say
to
dodge
the
virginia
bailiffs
well
papa
i
have
saved
you
from
that
fear
here
are
your
notes
to
milburn
and
others
sit
down
and
look
them
over
carefully
and
see
if
they
are
all
here
he
took
them
up
with
volatile
relief
laughing
on
his
yet
face
and
said
we
burn
them
vessy
nay
sir
not
till
you
have
seen
them
all
a
single
note
missing
would
give
you
the
same
perplexity
and
there
is
no
daughter
left
to
settle
it
he
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
yet
annoyance
you
are
not
going
to
make
a
meshach
milburn
of
me
stop
sir
vesta
said
you
might
do
worse
than
learn
from
my
husband
something
strange
in
her
expression
baffled
the
judge
ha
he
interjected
have
i
a
rival
already
daughter
is
his
conquest
as
complete
as
that
i
promised
to
honor
him
a
few
moments
ago
and
i
believe
i
can
papa
all
that
you
tell
me
adds
to
my
respect
for
a
man
who
seems
to
be
only
what
he
is
perhaps
you
can
love
him
too
the
judge
said
watching
her
with
an
apprehension
a
little
like
wonder
a
little
like
jealousy
oh
i
wish
i
could
papa
that
also
i
promised
to
do
and
i
will
try
but
my
work
will
all
be
a
failure
if
you
do
not
become
reconciled
to
milburn
it
was
for
you
i
married
him
and
to
save
your
name
your
peace
your
independence
and
the
upbraiding
we
expected
from
mamma
at
the
loss
of
her
dower
he
is
now
your
still
in
the
prime
of
life
with
the
business
training
you
lament
that
you
do
not
possess
begin
this
moment
papa
and
learn
his
habits
count
and
identify
those
notes
judge
custis
looked
them
over
separately
ran
the
number
of
notes
he
had
given
over
in
his
mind
and
said
yes
he
has
made
fair
restitution
there
are
none
missing
restitution
implies
that
he
has
robbed
you
papa
a
just
man
did
not
speak
there
every
penny
in
those
debts
is
stamped
with
injuries
and
coined
by
his
sacrifices
have
you
spent
his
money
remembering
that
no
my
child
i
suppose
not
give
me
the
notes
papa
she
took
them
and
sat
thinking
a
few
moments
silently
if
i
were
a
man
papa
she
said
at
length
i
would
try
to
learn
business
sense
it
must
be
so
respectable
to
live
with
one
mind
able
to
help
one
security
and
one
friends
and
prepare
for
age
or
sickness
while
strong
and
healthy
now
i
think
i
will
not
let
you
burn
these
notes
till
you
have
paid
the
price
of
them
please
write
a
transfer
of
this
house
servants
and
your
manor
to
me
vesta
yes
vesta
milburn
she
blushed
as
she
spoke
for
the
first
time
her
name
alas
sighed
her
father
vesta
custis
no
more
i
begin
to
feel
it
well
milburn
i
will
give
you
the
title
for
what
must
i
make
over
these
old
properties
to
you
in
consideration
of
my
repayment
of
the
sum
of
my
mother
estate
to
you
for
her
for
which
you
have
given
her
no
security
whatever
it
is
not
provided
for
by
these
notes
i
have
only
meshach
promise
that
he
will
pay
her
this
money
risked
and
lost
by
you
father
i
fear
very
heedlessly
is
it
restitution
also
for
milburn
to
strip
himself
to
pay
your
debts
to
mother
no
said
the
judge
guiltily
that
he
pays
on
account
of
his
passion
for
you
he
may
cheat
you
there
i
do
not
believe
it
because
he
has
been
faithful
to
me
so
many
years
before
i
knew
he
loved
me
a
man
who
keeps
himself
pure
for
a
woman
he
has
no
vows
to
will
pay
her
father
debts
of
honor
when
he
has
promised
judge
custis
found
the
issue
quite
too
warm
for
his
convenience
and
blushing
as
much
as
vesta
he
sat
down
and
drew
up
a
conveyance
of
his
property
to
vesta
milburn
in
her
own
right
and
in
consideration
of
thousand
dollars
paid
to
lucy
custis
on
account
of
judgment
confessed
to
her
by
daniel
custis
there
my
dear
he
said
passing
it
over
what
do
you
want
with
it
are
you
not
sure
of
a
home
here
as
long
as
you
live
even
with
me
as
the
proprietor
no
the
tragedy
nearly
finished
here
may
be
repeated
papa
and
all
of
us
be
homeless
if
you
can
go
in
debt
again
i
shall
not
do
that
not
even
for
my
husband
and
here
will
stand
teackle
hall
to
protect
you
all
from
the
cold
if
bad
times
ever
come
again
you
have
paid
a
greater
price
for
it
my
child
than
it
is
worth
and
you
are
entitled
to
it
besides
dear
father
if
milburn
needs
any
reminder
of
his
promise
to
repay
mamma
dowry
this
will
give
it
he
intended
his
gift
to
be
my
marriage
dower
and
were
i
to
convey
it
to
you
i
should
first
ask
his
consent
not
in
law
perhaps
but
in
delicacy
oh
yes
the
judge
said
carelessly
i
am
glad
you
have
such
good
reasons
yet
my
beautiful
my
last
child
pride
of
my
race
i
hate
to
see
you
so
ready
for
this
business
this
calculation
and
foresight
it
is
not
like
the
custises
i
fear
this
man
milburn
in
a
single
day
has
thrown
his
net
around
your
nature
and
annexed
you
to
his
sordid
existence
at
this
moment
the
redeeming
thing
about
you
is
that
you
can
not
love
him
dear
father
thoughts
like
that
beset
me
too
the
pride
of
aristocracy
the
remembrance
of
what
has
been
but
i
want
to
be
honest
and
not
to
cheat
my
heart
or
any
person
we
have
fallen
from
our
height
he
has
raised
himself
from
his
condition
and
there
is
no
deception
in
my
conduct
he
knows
i
do
not
love
him
instead
of
standing
upon
an
obdurate
heart
i
pray
god
to
melt
my
nature
and
mould
it
to
his
affection
regarding
her
a
moment
with
increasing
interest
judge
custis
came
forward
and
kissed
her
forehead
amen
then
he
said
may
you
love
your
husband
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
love
him
too
that
is
spoken
like
a
true
man
vesta
said
and
now
father
be
ready
here
for
milburn
arrival
ring
for
a
decanter
and
some
cake
it
will
not
hurt
you
after
your
fast
to
drink
a
glass
of
sherry
with
the
bridegroom
he
kissed
her
and
felt
her
trembling
in
his
arms
as
she
started
to
go
she
returned
and
clung
to
him
again
her
face
was
pale
with
fear
oh
dreadful
god
he
muttered
to
visit
my
many
sins
upon
this
spotless
angel
where
shall
i
fly
a
step
was
upon
the
porch
and
vesta
flashed
up
the
stairway
judge
custis
went
to
his
door
apprehensive
and
in
tears
a
strange
man
stood
there
with
his
eye
bruised
and
blood
dripping
down
to
his
coarse
beard
he
was
in
liquor
but
so
pale
that
it
was
apparent
by
the
starlight
said
the
man
you
do
know
me
judge
custis
no
matter
i
joe
johnson
the
judge
whose
tears
had
taken
him
far
from
things
of
trivial
memory
looked
at
the
man
and
repeated
johnson
not
joe
johnson
of
dorchester
yes
judge
joe
johnson
the
i
bought
many
a
nigger
from
a
custis
when
it
was
impolite
to
sell
judge
so
they
let
me
run
em
off
and
cussed
me
for
it
to
the
public
an
that
made
me
onpopular
judge
custis
and
that
my
fix
you
have
been
fighting
johnson
i
think
said
the
judge
with
suppressed
dislike
i
been
knocked
down
by
a
nigger
said
the
man
with
a
glare
of
ferocity
removing
his
hand
from
the
wounded
eye
as
if
it
inflamed
his
recollection
of
the
blow
to
see
the
drops
of
blood
drip
from
his
beard
to
the
porch
this
town
is
too
nice
to
abide
a
dealer
in
the
constitutional
article
and
so
they
set
on
me
when
i
was
a
little
with
lush
an
while
the
nigger
klemmed
me
in
the
peep
a
little
white
villain
with
a
steeple
bonnet
hit
me
in
the
with
a
stone
i
come
yer
judge
to
lie
up
in
the
kitchen
an
sleep
warm
over
sunday
for
the
cops
threaten
to
take
me
if
they
catch
me
before
midnight
i
suppose
you
know
johnson
that
i
am
a
magistrate
and
the
proper
harborage
i
give
to
breakers
of
the
peace
is
the
jail

not
afraid
of
that
limbo
judge
custis
when
i
come
to
you
old
patty
cannon

done
you
many
a
good
turn
with
joe
johnson
gang
about
election
times
in
the
upper
destreeks
of
somerset
patty
always
said
judge
custis
was
a
game
gentleman
that
returned
a
favor
the
judge
countenance
an
instant
blank
lighted
up
with
all
a
smile
and
he
said
joe
you
a
terrible
fellow
but
dear
old
aunt
patty
did
always
take
my
part
i
suspect
joe
that
you
have
run
afoul
of
samson
the
hired
man
of
meshach
milburn
who
is
a
boxer
though
i
wonder

he
could
get

your
youth
and
size
of
course
i
wo
let
you
come
to
harm
you
have
been
playing
your
tricks
on
anybody

my
word

took
a
load
of
egypt
down
the
nanticoke

the
feller
with
the
steeple
shap

well
joe
for
aunt
patty
sake
i
take
care
of
you
go
to
the
kitchen
door
and
i
step
through
the
house
and
tell
our
aunt
hominy
to
give
you
supper
and
breakfast
and
a
place
to
get
some
sleep
but
you
must
keep
out
of
the
way
and
slip
off
quietly
on
sunday
for
we
have
had
a
wedding
in
the
family
joe
and
though
i
can
not
understand
your
peculiar
slang
i
suspect
the
bridegroom
to
be
the
man
who
knocked
the
breath
out
of
you
with
the
stone
the
stranger
lifted
his
hand
from
his
bloody
eye
again
and
counted
the
red
drops
splashing
down
from
his
beard
judge
custis
marked
his
scowl
tut
tut
said
the
judge
you
will
never
get
your
revenge
out
of
that
man
he
is
too
strong
i
do
wonder
that
he
disabled
you
and
you
ever
get
into
his
clutches
joe
for
if
he
knows
you
are
here
i
shall
be
forced
to
send
you
to
jail
this
very
night
keep
out
of
the
hands
of
meshach
milburn
he
has
knocked
the
breath
out
of
you
johnson
but
there
are
some
whose
hearts
he
has
twisted
out
of
their
bodies
i
meet
him
somewhere
joe
johnson
muttered
but
not
in
princess
anne
and
he
pulled
down
his
slouched
hat
to
cover
his
eyes
and
stalked
away
to
find
the
kitchen
oh
what
a
day
can
bring
forth
judge
custis
thought
raising
his
hands
to
the
october
stars
meshach
of
the
ominous
hat
the
host
in
my
parlor
joe
johnson
the
of

cannon
the
guest
of
my
kitchen
chapter
xiv
meshach
home
vesta
had
slept
she
hardly
knew
how
long
but
it
was
day
and
slowly
her
eyes
turned
towards
the
remainder
of
her
bed
to
see
if
it
was
occupied
the
bridegroom
was
not
there
she
reached
her
foot
into
her
slipper
at
the
bedside
and
at
one
swift
step
passed
before
her
mirror
whispering
i
have
dreamed
it
all
the
fresh
flushing
skin
and
radiant
contrasts
of
hair
and
eyes
seemed
so
welcome
to
her
in
their
perfect
assurance
of
health
that
she
whispered
again
have
i
dreamed
it
he
is
not
here
oh
am
i
free
then
a
feeling
of
reproval
came
to
her
as
the
minutest
memory
of
that
wonderful
yesterday
rose
to
her
mind
and
the
vow
she
had
made
to
honor
and
obey
seemed
to
have
been
too
easily
repented
she
looked
upon
her
hand
and
the
little
thin
pathetic
thread
of
gold
reaffirmed
her
memory
of
the
and
at
the
next
suggestion
a
blush
coursed
through
her
being
like
a
redbird
in
the
perhaps
he
had
stolen
from
her
chamber
stealthily
as
he
came
while
she
drowned
in
deep
slumber
wotted
not
a
glance
into
the
mirror
again
revealed
those
blushes
repeating
each
other
like
the
aurora
in
the
northern
dawn
till
with
a
searching
consciousness
and
her
voice
raised
above
the
whisper
she
said
be
still
silly
opening
the
door
she
found
virgie
lying
on
the
rug
without
warmly
wrapped
in
her
mistress
but
wide
awake
virgie
no
one
has
passed
asked
vesta
no
miss
vessy
nobody
could
have
stepped
over
me
for
my
mind
has
been
too
awake
if
i
did
sleep
a
little
maybe
ai
miss
vessy
maybe
he
ashamed
hush
virgie
vesta
said
you
are
speaking
of
your
master
throwing
her
around
her
shoulders
the
maiden
bride
tripped
noiselessly
to
her
mother
apartment
the
door
was
open
the
night
taper
floating
in
its
vase
and
custis
lay
asleep
with
her
under
her
pillow
shall
i
awake
her
vesta
thought
yes
if
i
do
not
need
her
experience
i
do
want
her
confidence
and
not
to
give
her
mine
would
seem
deceit
now
vesta
kissed
her
mother
softly
and
placed
her
cheek
beside
that
thin
respectable
profile
as
she
awoke
and
said
daughter
mercy
why
what
has
become
of
you
it
seems
to
me
i
have
seen
nobody
for
days
and
i
wanted
to
express
my
indignation
even
in
my
dreams
where
have
you
been
oh
mamma
vesta
said
taking
custis
head
in
her
arms
i
have
been
finding
your
lost
fortune
which
troubled
us
all
so
much
it
is
to
be
given
back
to
you
dearest
my
husband
has
promised
to
do
so
your
husband
whom
have
you
selected
that
he
is
so
free
with
his
money
how
could
you
hear
from
baltimore
so
soon
now
do
tell
me
a
parcel
of
stuff
thinking
to
comfort
me
your
father
is
a
villain
and
my
connections
shall
know
it
custis
drew
her
from
under
her
head
and
began
to
cry
as
she
took
a
single
look
at
its
former
total
darling
mamma
vesta
said
seeing
you
so
miserable
yesterday
on
account
of
papa
failure
and
your
portion
gone
with
it
i
accepted
an
offer
of
marriage
and
have
a
rich
man
promise
that
first
of
all
your
part
shall
be
paid
to
you
this
house
and
our
manor
and
everything
as
it
is
the
servants
the
stable
and
the
movables
belong
to
me
in
my
own
name
paid
for
in
papa
notes
and
by
him
transferred
to
me
to
be
our
home
forever
so
that
a
revulsion
like
yesterday
may
not
again
cross
the
sill
of
our
door
does
not
that
deserve
a
kiss
mamma
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
said
custis
this
is
another
trick
to
deceive
me
i
do
accuse
you
of
it
vesta
but
you
are
the
victim
of
somebody
and
your
father
now
who
can
this
man
be
so
free
with
his
ready
money
it
not
the
style
in
baltimore
to
promise
so
liberally
as
all
that
have
you
accepted
young
carroll
no
nor
thought
of
him
mamma
then
it
must
be
that
widower
fool
hynson
ready
to
sell
his
negroes
for
a
second
wife
like
you
he
has
neither
been
here
in
body
or
mind
vesta
said
never
in
my
mind
that
would
be
a
marriage
to
make
a
talk
it
would
be
like
you
to
bestow
so
much
beauty
on
a
widower
i
think
there
is
a
certain
vulgarity
about
an
elegant
girl
marrying
a
widower
she
is
so
refined
and
he
is
generally
so
sleek
and
sensual
did
you
hear
from
charles
mclane
nothing
mamma
let
me
ease
your
mind
by
telling
you
that
my
husband
lives
here
in
princess
anne
he
was
father
creditor
meshach
milburn
he
has
loved
me
unknown
for
years
i
saw
a
way
to
stop
all
scandal
and
recrimination
by
marrying
him
at
once
that
the
society
we
know
would
have
but
one
and
not
two
subjects
of
curiosity
papa
saw
me
married
last
night
to
milburn
and
i
bear
his
name
this
sabbath
day
his
wife
meshach
milburn
the
vulgarian
in
the
hat
that
man
daughter
you
play
with
my
poor
head
it
is
going
again
mother
it
is
true
i
am
milburn
my
husband
is
your
benefactor
it
was
unnecessary
to
say
more
for
custis
had
really
fainted
poor
mother
thought
vesta
i
am
confirmed
in
my
fear
that
if
she
had
been
told
of
my
purpose
she
would
have
opposed
it
bitterly
roxy
was
summoned
to
assist
vesta
and
after
custis
had
become
conscious
and
sighed
and
cried
hysterically
her
daughter
sitting
in
her
lady
rocker
spoke
out
plainly
mother
i
appreciate
your
disappointment
in
my
marriage
though
i
should
be
the
one
to
make
complaint
and
receive
sympathy
instead
of
discouragement
but
i
do
not
desire
it
indeed
i
will
not
permit
any
person
to
disparage
my
husband
or
draw
odious
comparisons
between
my
poverty
and
his
exertions
if
there
are
in
my
body
or
my
society
any
merits
to
please
a
man
they
have
fallen
to
him
under
the
law
of
providence
that
he
that
hath
shall
receive
i
pity
your
illness
dear
mamma
but
i
fear
milburn
is
ill
too
for
he
has
not
been
here
all
night
though
he
left
me
at
the
i
hope
the
viper
is
dead
custis
said
with
great
clearness
and
energized
it
by
sitting
up
in
bed
roxy
left
the
room
i
hope
he
has
been
murdered
said
custis
and
that
the
murderer
will
never
be
discovered
if
there
is
any
spirit
of
the
mclanes
left
in
my
brothers
and
nephews
they
will
wipe
out
in
blood
the
insult
of
this
marriage
between
my
daughter
and
the
man
who
set
a
trap
upon
the
honor
of
a
respectable
family
vesta
arose
with
a
pale
troubled
face
yet
with
some
of
her
prejudice
flashing
back
he
can
defend
himself
mamma
i
shall
go
to
seek
him
now
since
he
is
so
much
hated
for
me
she
returned
to
her
room
and
put
on
a
and
made
her
toilet
in
the
library
vesta
found
her
father
dozing
in
a
large
chair
with
his
feet
upon
a
leather
sofa
and
a
silk
handkerchief
drawn
across
his
crown
under
which
were
the
dry
beds
of
tears
that
had
coursed
down
his
cheeks
she
saw
with
a
touch
of
joy
that
the
sherry
in
the
decanter
was
untouched
and
the
two
glasses
were
still
clean
he
had
not
relapsed
into
his
habits
even
while
making
an
vigil
to
wait
for
the
unwelcome
he
started
as
she
entered
and
then
stared
at
her
between
his
dazed
wits
and
a
mute
inquiry
that
she
could
understand
he
has
not
come
papa
and
mamma
oh
she
is
severe
vesta
trembling
at
the
throat
a
moment
rushed
into
her
arms
and
buried
the
sob
in
his
breast
poor
soul
poor
lamb
poor
thing
he
said
over
and
over
while
his
temper
slowly
rose
that
seldom
rose
of
recent
years
since
pleasure
and
carelessness
had
taken
its
masculine
sting
away
but
vesta
felt
his
tones
change
while
he
petted
her
and
at
last
heard
him
say
hoarsely
by
god
sh
h
she
whispered
raising
her
hand
to
his
mouth
i
will
kill
somebody
he
went
on
finishing
his
sentence
and
as
she
drew
away
he
strode
across
the
room
and
back
again
a
noble
exhibition
of
passion
that
had
a
noble
origin
in
fatherly
pity
do
lose
your
true
pride
papa
after
you
have
persevered
so
long
vesta
said
it
is
sunday
do
you
think
he
will
come
what
can
have
happened
he
will
either
come
or
fight
me
judge
custis
remarked
i
have
tried
to
be
a
peaceable
man
and
christian
magistrate
albeit
a
poor
hypocrite
in
some
things
but
i
am
pushed
too
far
my
wife
smallness
is
worse
than
insanity
and
wickedness
put
together
between
her
and
this
fiend
and
my
neglected
child
entrapped
into
such
a
marriage
by
god
i
will
clean
my
old
duelling
arms
and
appeal
to
injustice
itself
to
set
me
even
if
he
had
been
in
his
sincere
grief
he
was
thrice
more
attractive
in
his
sincere
high
spirit
vesta
admiring
him
in
spite
of
her
cares
did
not
like
to
see
him
in
this
unnatural
recklessness
dear
father
she
said
soothingly
you
have
no
cause
of
quarrel
i
have
every
cause
he
cried
the
proposal
to
marry
you
was
an
insult
for
which
i
should
have
challenged
him
and
shot
him
if
he
declined
now
he
has
married
you
and
absconded
using
you
and
the
custis
honor
with
contempt
in
my
day
i
was
the
best
shot
in
eastern
virginia
i
can
kill
a
man
in
this
cause
as
easily
as
i
have
broken
either
of
a
man
arms
at
choice
in
my
courting
days
public
opinion
will
clear
me
under
this
provocation
and
i
can
acquit
my
own
conscience
abhorrent
as
duelling
is
to
me
my
would
leap
to
take
the
quarrel
up
and
rid
the
world
of
meshach
milburn
that
is
mamma
idea
to
kill
the
debtor
who
has
been
specially
kind
to
her
she
says
she
will
send
for
uncle
allan
mclane
and
is
more
unreasonable
than
ever
papa
your
feelings
are
unjust
something
we
do
not
know
of
has
happened
to
milburn
he
was
not
himself
all
the
while
at
the
church
now
that
i
recollect
he
was
not
ardent
for
the
marriage
to
be
so
soon
it
was
i
who
hastened
the
hour
let
us
be
right
in
everything
having
progressed
so
far
with
the
recovery
of
our
fortunes
and
let
us
await
the
fulfilment
of
events
hopefully
milburn
was
drunk
at
the
ceremony
i
saw
that
judge
custis
said
but
it
was
no
excuse
in
fact
what
good
can
come
of
this
violent
alliance
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
leaped
from
the
into
the
fire
i
feel
ugly
my
daughter
and
there
is
no
concealing
it
then
you
are
in
the
mood
to
talk
to
mother
this
morning
vesta
said
while
you
have
some
unusual
will
and
spirit
this
resentful
sullenness
she
is
showing
i
fear
more
than
your
passing
emotion
papa
be
firm
yet
kind
with
her
and
i
will
go
to
find
my
husband
yes
that
is
my
place
he
may
be
more
justly
complaining
of
my
absence
now
than
we
of
his
neglect
you
do
mean
that
you
are
going
to
visit
him
at
his
den
i
shall
go
there
first
it
would
have
been
my
home
last
night
if
he
had
required
it
to
tell
the
truth
vesta
said
blushing
the
poor
man
was
so
kind
to
me
yesterday
in
spite
of
his
object
and
so
quaint
and
as
it
seemed
dependent
on
me
that
my
charity
is
enlisted
for
him
and
i
could
almost
have
married
him
from
pity
the
judge
temper
fell
a
little
in
the
study
of
his
blushing
wonderful
wonderful
he
thought
to
himself
that
poor
fellow
has
already
made
more
impression
on
this
girl
pride
than
a
hundred
cavalier
gallants
truly
we
are
a
republic
vesta
he
continued
aloud
and
you
lay
down
the
custis
character
as
easily
as
our
old
connection
lord
fairfax
accepted
the
democracy
of
his
hired
surveyor
washington
before
he
died
i
laid
down
the
custis
name
yesterday
vesta
said
though
not
their
better
character
i
hope
papa
there
is
only
one
law
of
marriage
it
is
where
the
wife
follows
the
husband
she
looked
a
little
archly
at
him
wiping
her
eyes
of
recent
tears
and
though
she
may
not
have
meant
it
he
was
reminded
of
his
own
fear
of
his
wife
aunt
hominy
now
came
in
having
been
told
by
virgie
to
prepare
coffee
and
she
followed
roxy
who
brought
it
into
the
library
the
old
cook
had
a
strange
look
as
of
one
who
had
been
up
all
night
at
a
fire
or
a
protracted
meeting
and
she
poked
her
head
in
as
if
afraid
to
come
farther
till
vesta
went
out
and
kissed
her
kindly
poor
aunty
hominy
did
you
think
i
was
sold
or
abused
because
i
had
been
married
dear
old
aunty
i
shall
never
leave
you
aunt
hominy
had
a
countenance
of
profound
almost
vacant
melancholy
mixed
with
a
fear
that
the
judge
remarked
he
had
seen
on
the
faces
of
niggers
that
had
stolen
something
miss
vessy
she
stammered

all

a
dumb
terrified

adhered
to
the
old
black
woman

gasped

of

in
then
as
vesta
drew
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
having
taken
her
coffee
and
toast
the
old
servant
gliding
back
in
the
depths
of
teackle

raised
a
wild
african
croon
as
over
the
dead
giving
her
voice
a
musical
inflection
like
the
jingle
of
juba
rhyme

o

farewell
the
tears
raining
upon
her
cheeks
her
wild
wringing
hands
and
upflung
arms
and
shape
convulsed
vesta
remembered
long
and
thought
as
she
left
teackle
hall
with
virgie
that
some
african
superstition
had
by
the
aid
of
dreams
drawn
into
a
passing
excitement
the
faithful
servant
brain
at
the
corner
of
old
front
street
and
extending
almost
out
upon
the
little
manokin
bridge
stood
meshach
milburn
house
and
store
with
a
door
upon
both
streets
though
planted
low
in
a
hollow
it
stood
forward
like
milburn
challenging
countenance
unsupported
by
any
neighbors
do
it
look
like
a
witch
missy
virgie
said
as
vesta
took
in
its
not
unpicturesque
outlines
and
crude
plank
carpentry
the
roof
the
decrepit
chimney
at
the
far
end
the
one
garret
window
in
the
sharp
gable
the
scant
little
windows
above
stairs
and
the
doors
low
to
the
sand
it
may
have
been
the
pride
of
the
town
fifty
years
ago
virgie
i
have
passed
it
many
a
day
looking
with
mischievous
curiosity
for
the
to
show
that
to
some
city
friend
little
thinking
i
must
ever
enter
the
house
but
hear
that
wilful
bird
singing
so
loud
where
is
it
i
ca
tell
to
save
my
life
it
ai
in
the
tree
yonder
it
the
first
bird
up
this
mornin
miss
vessy
sho
is
not
that
larger
door
standing
ajar
the
one
with
the
four
panels
in
it
vesta
asked
yes
it
is
unfastened
and
partly
open
the
blood
left
vesta
heart
a
moment
as
the
thought
ran
through
her
mind
he
has
been
watched
followed
home
and
murdered
the
idea
seemed
to
explain
his
absence
on
his
marriage
night
and
like
a
sudden
flame
first
seen
upon
a
burning
ship
lighting
up
the
wide
ocean
with
its
bright
terrors
vesta
saw
the
infinite
relations
of
such
a
crime
her
almost
secret
marriage
her
custody
of
her
father
notes
the
record
of
them
upon
her
husband
books
his
last
word
at
the
church
gate
i
will
come
soon
darling
and
now
this
silent
abode
with
its
door
ajar
on
sunday
dawn
before
the
town
was
up
they
might
bear
the
suspicion
of
a
dreadful
crime
by
the
ruined
debtor
house
of
custis
against
their
friendless
creditor
this
thought
personal
to
her
father
was
immediately
dismissed
in
the
feeling
for
a
possibly
murdered
husband
if
the
idea
barely
touched
her
sense
of
self
that
her
tremendous
sacrifice
had
been
arrested
by
heaven
and
her
purity
saved
between
the
altar
and
the
nuptials
by
the
bloodshed
of
her
purchaser
at
the
hands
of
some
meaner
avenger
though
not
until
she
had
redeemed
her
father
from
milburn
clutch
this
idea
never
passed
beyond
the
portal
of
her
mind
she
repulsed
it
entering
and
began
to
think
of
the
easy
prey
her
husband
might
have
been
hated
by
so
many
defended
by
none
known
to
be
very
rich
no
loss
to
the
community
as
it
might
think
in
its
financial
ignorance
and
his
only
guard
a
stalwart
negro
notorious
for
fighting
believing
milburn
to
deserve
better
than
his
present
fame
vesta
advanced
towards
the
door
of
the
old
wooden
store
with
a
spirit
of
commiseration
and
awe
and
still
the
wild
bird
from
somewhere
poured
out
a
shriek
a
chuckle
a
hurrah
enough
to
turn
her
blood
to
ice
as
vesta
pushed
open
the
old
seasoned
door
it
dragged
along
the
floor
and
the
loose
iron
bar
and
padlock
dropping
down
made
a
ring
that
brought
an
echo
like
a
tomb
out
of
the
hollow
interior
miss
vessy
i
to
go
in
there
virgie
said
you
are
not
to
come
in
till
i
call
you
but
hear
that
bird
rioting
in
song
does
milburn
keep
birds
i
ca
tell
miss
vessy
that
bird
a
mocker
it
must
be
in
there
somewhere
oh
do
go
in
miss
vessy
something
will
catch
you
dear
missy
sho
but
vesta
was
already
gone
following
the
piercing
sound
of
the
native
bird
that
seemed
to
be
in
the
loft
she
saw
a
little
counter
of
pine
and
a
pine
desk
built
into
it
and
bundles
of
skins
some
a
pile
of
lumber
and
boxes
a
few
barrels
of
oil
or
spirits
and
dust
and
cobwebs
thick
on
everything
and
a
little
way
in
from
the
door
the
light
and
darkness
made
weird
effects
upon
each
other
increasing
the
apparent
distances
and
changing
the
forms
and
the
sun
now
risen
made
turning
cylinders
of
at
certain
in
the
eastern
gable
across
whose
film
she
saw
two
lean
mice
stand
upon
the
floor
unalarmed
and
tamely
watch
her
come
the
screaming
of
the
bird
was
conveyed
through
the
thin
floor
from
above
with
loud
distinctness
and
every
note
of
singing
things
seemed
to
be
imitated
by
it
from
the
hawk
gloating
cry
to
the
swallow
twittering
alarm
with
the
most
rapid
versatility
and
even
hurry
as
if
the
creature
was
trying
over
every
bird
language
with
the
hope
of
finding
one
mankind
could
understand
it
was
idle
to
expect
to
be
heard
amid
such
clamor
and
vesta
having
pounded
on
the
floor
a
few
times
made
her
way
to
a
sort
of
cupboard
that
might
turn
out
to
be
a
stairway
and
sure
enough
a
door
opened
on
its
dark
side
and
light
from
above
flickered
down
at
this
moment
the
bird
notes
abruptly
ceased
and
a
voice
unlike
anything
she
had
ever
heard
in
her
life
yet
human
spoke
in
response
to
a
more
natural
human
voice
both
issuing
from
above
the
second
voice
seemed
to
be
milburn
the
first
voice
was
something
like
it
yet
not
like
anything
from
the
throat
of
man
and
the
superstition
she
had
been
rebuking
in
her
servant
came
with
a
thrilling
influence
upon
her
entire
nature
she
was
about
to
fly
but
called
out
one
word
as
she
arrested
herself
gentlemen
gentlemen
the
loud
unclassifiable
voice
above
immediately
answered
gent
gents
ha
ha
gentlemen
may
i
come
up
vesta
cried
come
come
chee
come
tsee
see
me
see
me
see
me
come
come
see
come
see
me
the
last
accentuation
in
spite
of
the
bird
interference
was
sufficiently
distinct
to
amount
to
an
invitation
and
with
a
raising
of
her
eyelids
once
dependently
to
heaven
vesta
went
up
the
stairs
she
put
her
head
into
a
large
long
room
which
took
up
the
whole
contents
of
the
second
story
and
was
lighted
on
three
sides
by
the
small
windows
she
had
seen
without
it
had
no
carpet
or
of
any
kind
the
fire
was
gone
out
upon
the
in
the
end
and
the
atmosphere
a
little
chill
was
melting
before
the
sunshine
which
now
streamed
in
at
both
sides
of
the
fireplace
and
clearly
revealed
every
object
in
the
apartment
some
a
wooden
table
with
a
blue
plate
a
blue
cup
and
saucer
and
a
saucepan
upon
it
and
a
coarse
knife
and
fork
a
large
green
chest
and
a
leather
an
old
hair
trunk
fifty
years
old
and
nearly
falling
to
pieces
black
silhouettes
in
little
round
ebony
frames
of
a
woman
and
a
man
hung
over
the
mantel
and
between
them
a
silhouette
of
a
face
she
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
to
be
intended
for
her
own
stretched
upon
a
low
child
bed
of
the
sort
called
in
those
days
which
could
be
wheeled
under
the
bed
of
the
parents
lay
the
bridegroom
in
his
and
gaitered
shoes
with
his
hat
upon
the
faded
calico
quilt
beside
him
and
his
face
as
red
as
burning
fever
could
make
it
vesta
only
verified
the
particulars
of
the
inventory
of
milburn
lodge
afterwards
her
instant
attention
being
drawn
to
the
motionless
form
of
her
husband
whose
flushed
face
seemed
to
indicate
a
death
by
strangulation
or
apoplexy
she
went
forward
and
put
her
hand
upon
him
mr
milburn
she
spoke
milburn
echoed
a
voice
of
piercing
strength
though
ill
articulated
she
looked
around
in
astonishment
and
saw
nobody
husband
vesta
spoke
louder
stooping
over
him
see
see
shouted
the
wanton
voice
almost
at
her
elbow
vesta
with
one
hand
on
the
helpless
man
brow
turned
again
almost
indignantly
for
the
tone
seemed
to
address
some
sense
of
neglect
or
shame
in
her
which
she
had
not
been
guilty
of
still
nothing
was
to
be
seen
at
the
far
corner
of
the
room
was
a
leading
to
a
hole
in
the
loft
above
but
this
was
not
the
place
of
the
interruption
for
she
heard
the
voice
now
come
as
from
the
chimney
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
nearer
the
bed
and
accompanied
with
a
fluttering
and
scratching
as
if
some
spirit
of
evil
with
the
talons
of
a
rat
or
a
bat
was
trying
to
break
in
where
the
prostrate
man
lay
on
the
bed
of
oblivion
meshach
meshach
rang
the
cry
hoo

meshach

she
she
she

hoot

rapidly
changing
her
view
with
her
ears
no
less
than
her
heart
tingling
at
the
use
of
her
own
name
vesta
saw
on
the
dusty
wooden
mantel
a
common
bird
of
a
gray
color
with
dashes
of
brown
and
black
upon
his
wings
and
a
whitish
breast
and
he
was
greatly
agitated
as
if
he
meant
to
fly
upon
her
or
upon
some
other
intruder
she
could
not
see
his
eyes
of
black
pupils
upon
yellowish
eyeballs
sparkled
with
nervous
activity
he
flung
himself
into
the
air
above
her
head
uttering
sounds
of
such
mellow
richness
and
such
infinite
fecundity
of
modulation
that
the
old
hovel
almost
burst
with
intoxicated
song
combining
gladness
welcome
fear
defiance
superstition
horror
and
epithalamium
all
together
like
orpheus
gone
mad
and
losing
the
continuity
of
his
golden
notes
the
bird
upper
bill
was
beaked
like
a
hawk
his
lower
was
sharp
as
a
lance
and
between
them
issued
that
infuriated
melody
and
cadence
and
epithet
that
old
patrick
henry
spirit
might
have
migrated
into
from
his
grave
in
the
virginia
woods
he
suddenly
flung
himself
from
his
vortex
of
song
upon
the
bed
of
the
sick
man
with
a
twitching
hop
and
rapid
opening
and
shutting
of
the
tail
like
the
fan
of
a
disturbed
beauty
and
thence
perched
upon
milburn
peaked
hat
and
with
a
convulsive
struggle
of
his
throat
and
body
as
if
he
were
in
superhuman
labor
brought
out
distinct
as
man
could
speak
the
words
vesty
vesty
sweet
sweet
come
see
come
see
vesta
by
a
quick
expert
movement
grasped
the
bird
and
smoothed
it
against
her
bosom
and
soothed
its
excitement
she
had
heard
verified
what
audubon
avowed
and
had
but
recently
published
in
the
beautiful
edition
of
his
works
her
father
was
a
subscriber
to
that
some
said
the
american
could
imitate
the
human
voice
though
the
naturalist
remarked
that
he
himself
had
never
heard
the
bird
do
it
the
present
verification
vesta
thought
of
the
supremest
power
might
have
issued
from
its
excitement
at
the
silent
and
helpless
condition
of
its
master
that
master
who
had
told
vesta
that
no
bird
in
the
woods
ever
resisted
his
seductions
and
mystic
influence
if
that
be
true
vesta
said
to
herself
there
is
no
danger
of
this
vociferous
pet
making
his
escape
if
i
put
him
out
of
the
window
till
i
can
see
if
his
master
speaks
or
lives
so
she
raised
the
window
and
flung
the
up
into
the
air
and
it
came
down
and
dropped
into
the
old
beneath
and
there
set
up
a
concert
the
sabbath
morning
might
have
been
proud
of
when
in
the
the
saviour
went
plucking
the
milky
ears
vesta
could
but
stop
a
minute
and
listen
the
liquid
notes
chased
each
other
around
in
circles
of
dizzy
harmony
as
if
angels
were
at
on
the
blue
branches
of
the
air
eluding
each
other
in
chasing
each
other
with
eager
love
sighing
praise
and
happiness
as
their
supernal
hearts
emitted
music
in
the
glow
of
ecstasy
and
carrying
upward
the
loveliest
emotions
of
the
earth
in
yearning
sympathy
for
nature
no
language
now
that
vesta
could
identify
was
woven
into
that
maze
of
morning
song
which
challenged
with
its
fulness
and
golden
weight
the
floods
of
sunshine
matching
light
with
sound
spontaneous
both
and
rivals
for
the
favors
of
the
soft
atmosphere
singing
with
all
its
heart
outdoing
all
it
knew
forgetting
imitation
in
wild
improvisation
watching
her
window
as
it
danced
upon
the
twigs
and
fluttered
into
the
air
conscious
of
her
listening
as
it
purled
and
warbled
towards
her
and
sounded
every
pipe
and
trumpet
virginal
and
clarion
hautboy
and
castanet
in
the
orchestra
of
its
rustic
bosom
the
ode
seemed
almost
supernatural
this
morn
to
vesta
and
she
thought
to
herself
oh
what
wedding
music
in
the
cathedral
at
baltimore
could
equal
that
and
this
poor
man
receives
it
for
his
epithalamium
without
cost
as
truly
as
if
nature
were
greeting
my
coming
to
him
in
the
old
spirit
all
is
done
bring
home
the
bride
againe
bring
home
the
triumph
of
our
victory
bring
home
with
you
the
glory
of
her
gaine
with
joyance
bring
her
and
with
jollity
sing
ye
sweet
angels
alleluia
sing
that
all
the
woods
may
answer
and
your
echo
ring
relieved
from
the
agitation
of
the
vesta
now
gave
her
whole
attention
to
her
husband
and
the
high
heat
of
his
brain
and
circulation
and
his
muttering
like
delirium
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
had
an
intense
attack
of
intermittent
fever
she
heard
the
words
several
times
repeated
by
him
i
will
come
soon
darling
and
the
simplicity
of
his
devotion
to
her
unloved
as
he
was
had
such
flavor
of
pathos
in
it
that
the
tears
started
to
vesta
eyes
poor
soul
she
said
it
will
be
long
before
i
can
love
him
his
hunger
must
be
enduring
but
my
duty
is
not
the
less
clear
to
stay
by
his
side
and
nurse
him
as
his
wife
at
this
conclusion
she
looked
milburn
over
carefully
to
see
if
any
wound
or
sign
of
violence
whether
by
accident
or
an
enemy
appeared
upon
him
and
finding
none
and
he
all
the
time
wandering
in
his
sleep
she
climbed
the
ladder
and
peeped
into
the
garret
to
see
if
his
servant
might
be
there
samson
bed
as
she
supposed
it
was
had
not
been
disturbed
and
so
descending
she
raised
the
window
over
the
larger
door
she
had
entered
by
and
beckoned
virgie
to
come
up
take
this
tin
cup
she
said
to
the
quadroon
and
go
to
the
spring
near
here
and
bring
it
to
me
full
of
water
then
as
the
girl
tripped
away
vesta
found
a
piece
of
paper
and
wrote
her
father
a
note
telling
him
to
come
to
her
and
to
the
girl
when
she
returned
her
mistress
said
i
want
you
to
get
a
roll
of
new
at
teackle
hall
and
have
it
brought
here
to
spread
upon
this
floor
send
me
too
a
pair
of
our
brass
andirons
and
pack
in
a
basket
some
glass
and
linen
tell
papa
to
bring
one
of
his
own
and
to
take
down
my
picture
in
the
and
wrap
it
up
and
have
it
sent
i
must
have
mamma
and
a
wheelbarrow
of
ice
and
let
hominy
make
some
strong
tea
and
toast
virgie
do
not
forget
that
this
sick
gentleman
is
my
husband
and
a
part
of
our
own
family
the
girl
face
preserved
its
respect
with
difficulty
as
she
heard
the
last
part
of
the
sentence
but
she
replied
to
what
she
understood
to
be
a
warning
by
saying
miss
vessy
i
never
tell
anybody
tales
no
dear
you
do
not
i
only
feared
you
might
forget
the
very
different
view
we
must
take
of
milburn
from
his
former
life
here
being
again
left
alone
vesta
took
the
tin
cup
of
and
raising
the
disturbed
man
head
she
gave
him
a
drink
and
as
he
opened
his
eyes
to
see
whom
it
was
she
heard
him
say
with
an
articulate
sigh
heaven
with
the
remainder
of
the
water
and
her
handkerchief
she
washed
his
hot
skin
and
kept
it
moist
and
fitful
murmurs
as
darling
angel
beautiful
lady
came
from
his
roving
brain
as
perception
and
poison
contended
for
his
mind
the
inborn
sense
in
woman
of
happiness
after
doing
good
offices
and
being
appreciated
was
attended
with
a
certain
intellectual
elation
and
even
amusement
at
having
witnessed
what
was
altogether
new
to
her
the
life
of
the
meaner
class
of
white
people
she
looked
at
the
dexterous
silhouette
of
herself
cut
probably
from
memory
long
ago
by
the
man
no
doubt
who
never
knew
her
until
yesterday
and
guessing
the
companion
profiles
to
be
his
mother
and
father
she
exclaimed
mentally
i
can
not
see
anything
insincere
about
this
man
statement
to
me
here
are
all
the
proofs
of
his
deep
attachment
to
me
long
before
he
forced
my
name
upon
papa
with
such
apparent
insolence
if
papa
could
see
these
proofs
with
a
woman
interest
he
would
have
a
full
apology
in
them
here
too
is
the
bird
that
sings
my
name
what
strength
of
prepossession
the
master
must
have
had
to
make
the
feathered
pupil
repeat
the
sound
of
and
call
me
what
resources
too
without
the
use
of
money
or
social
aids
he
knows
the
story
of
our
english
beginning
while
we
make
it
an
idle
boast
but
to
him
cromwell
and
milton
raleigh
and
vane
are
men
of
ah
vesta
thought
i
think
i
see
now
one
of
those
puritans
in
my
husband
of
whom
i
have
heard
as
sprinkled
through
virginia
we
are
the
cavaliers
there
is
the
roundhead
even
to
the
king
james
hat
as
she
was
led
onward
in
these
probabilities
vesta
took
up
the
demure
old
hat
and
looked
it
over
without
any
superstition
and
reflected
do
we
not
exaggerate
trifles
why
should
this
man
be
so
derided
because
he
covers
his
head
with
an
old
hat
what
of
it
suppose
it
shows
some
vanity
or
eccentricity
why
is
there
more
merit
in
covering
that
up
than
in
expressing
it
in
the
dress
the
styles
we
wear
are
the
derision
even
of
the
current
journals
and
what
will
be
thought
of
them
fifty
years
hence
when
the
fashion
magazines
show
me
as
i
look
the
envy
of
my
moment
the
fright
of
my
grandchildren
with
rising
color
she
put
the
hat
in
the
leather
and
shut
it
up
judge
custis
made
his
way
up
the
dark
stairs
in
a
little
while
and
as
soon
as
he
looked
at
milburn
exclaimed
curses
come
home
to
roost
it
was
only
night
before
last
that
i
said
in
the
presence
of
meshach
negro
the
ague
strike
him
and
the
bilious
sweat
from
nassawongo
he
slept
by
it
that
night
while
i
was
tossing
in
misery
the
next
night
it
was
his
turn
daughter
he
has
the
bilious
intermittent
fever
the
legacy
of
all
his
fathers
he
exposed
himself
i
suppose
extraordinarily
that
night
and
i
hear
that
he
burned
the
old
cabin
in
the
morning
now
he
will
burn
in
memory
of
it
for
the
next
ten
weeks
for
he
has
i
suspect
from
the
time
of
day
the
burning
and
delirium
came
what
is
called
the
double
quotidian
type
of
the
fever
with
two
attacks
in
the
hours
poor
man
exclaimed
vesta
now
i
can
account
for
his
appearance
at
the
marriage
ceremony
last
night
the
fever
was
on
him
but
he
went
through
it
by
hard
grit
and
probably
returning
here
to
get
some
relief
he
just
fell
over
on
that
bed
and
his
head
left
him
for
some
hours
the
paroxysm
goes
away
during
sleep
and
returns
in
the
morning
so
before
he
could
get
abroad
even
if
he
could
walk
to
report
himself
at
teackle
hall
another
fever
came
and
a
furious
one
too
and
he
will
have
good
luck
to
survive
forty
days
of
fever
with
probably
eighty
sweats
in
that
time
he
must
be
doctored
at
once
papa
well
i
am
good
enough
doctor
for
the
bilious
fever
he
wants
plenty
of
cold
lemonade
cold
sponging
and
ice
to
suck
when
the
fever
is
on
him
when
the
chills
intervene
he
wants
blanketing
hot
bottles
at
his
feet
and
hot
tea
or
something
stronger
in
the
rest
between
the
attacks
of
fever
and
chill
he
wants
calomel
and
peruvian
bark
and
if
these
delirious
spells
go
on
he
may
want
both
bleeding
and
opium
here
are
some
of
the
things
he
immediately
needs
then
vesta
said
as
a
tall
white
man
she
had
never
seen
before
came
up
the
stairs
with
virgie
bringing
some
susquehanna
ice
in
a
blanket
and
a
roll
of
carpet
and
other
articles
she
had
sent
for
the
man
face
wore
a
large
bruise
that
heightened
his
savage
appearance
judge
exclaimed
the
stranger
i
doin
a
little
work
to
pay
fur
my
board
who
your
whiffler
he
know
me
when
he
sees
me
next
time
following
the
stranger
eyes
vesta
and
her
father
saw
meshach
milburn
half
raised
up
from
the
low
staring
at
joe
johnson
as
if
trying
to
get
at
him
his
lips
moved
he
partly
articulated
catch
the
scoundre
joe
said
the
judge
slip
away
he
recognizes
you
as
the
assailant
yesterday
do
hesitate
see
how
he
glares
at
you
oh
it
the
with
the
steeple
him
that
settled
me
with
the
brick
said
the
stranger
in
a
low
voice
so
i
have
piped
him
ah
that
plumby
as
the
tall
man
started
to
go
milburn
countenance
relaxed
he
wandered
again
in
his
head
and
fell
back
upon
the
bed
i
told
you
he
was
a
hard
hater
johnson
the
judge
remarked
them
shakes
is
the
equivvy
for
the
bruise
he
give
me
that
is
till
we
both
heal
up
he
painted
the
ensigns
of
all
nations
on
my
stummick
judge
but
a
blow
is
cured
by
a
blow
with
a
look
of
admiring
computation
upon
the
girl
virgie
joe
johnson
drew
his
long
figure
down
the
stairs
like
a
pole
what
a
brutal
giant
vesta
said
and
how
came
he
to
be
doing
our
errands
why
aunt
hominy
had
nobody
to
bring
the
wheelbarrow
load
and
this
man
said
he
come
and
he
would
come
miss
vesty
so
i
could
say
anything
he
a
man
of
a
good
deal
of
influence
said
the
judge
uneasily
in
the
upper
part
of
our
county
and
in
delaware
last
night
after
the
wedding
he
slapped
meshach
hat
and
old
samson
knocked
him
down
for
it
and
he
would
have
killed
samson
i
hear
but
for
your
bridegroom
who
felled
him
with
a
timely
brick
it
a
hard
team
to
pass
on
a
narrow
road
meshach
and
samson
hey
virgie
i
glad
old
samson
beat
him
anyway
the
pretty
quadroon
said
showing
her
white
teeth
oh
what
troubles
will
not
that
hat
bring
upon
us
vesta
thought
and
then
spoke
if
milburn
was
strong
i
think
he
would
hardly
let
that
man
get
out
of
the
county
before
night
well
daughter
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
these
articles
he
has
brought
they
are
to
make
this
room
comfortable
see
he
has
my
picture
here
cut
by
his
own
hands
i
want
to
put
a
better
one
before
him
help
me
hang
it
papa
in
a
few
minutes
the
bright
oil
portrait
but
recently
painted
by
rembrandt
peale
was
taking
the
sunlight
upon
its
warm
brunette
cheeks
in
full
sight
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
thick
rag
carpet
warmed
the
floor
and
virgie
had
made
a
second
errand
to
teackle
hall
and
brought
back
the
lady
that
milburn
so
much
affected
and
toilet
articles
and
some
dark
cloth
to
hide
the
bare
boards
in
places
and
the
old
loft
soon
wore
a
reasonable
appearance
of
habitable
life
virgie
made
up
the
fire
and
the
brass
andirons
took
the
cheerful
flame
upon
them
while
vesta
sweetened
the
lemonade
after
her
father
had
cut
and
squeezed
the
lemons
and
added
some
magnesia
to
make
the
drink
foam
really
said
judge
custis
this
miserable
den
takes
the
rudimentary
form
of
a
home
i
suppose
there
are
now
more
comforts
in
his
sight
than
meshach
whole
race
ever
collected
what
is
your
next
move
vesta
to
stay
right
here
darling
papa
till
it
is
safe
and
convenient
to
carry
milburn
home
oh
folly
it
will
excite
scandal
and
be
repulsive
to
my
feelings
this
loft
over
a
former
groggery
is
no
place
for
you
the
news
will
spread
from
chincoteague
to
arlington
every
custis
that
lives
will
censure
me
and
outlaw
you
i
think
you
had
best
see
tilghman
before
the
service
papa
and
have
the
marriage
announced
from
the
desk
this
morning
that
will
settle
the
excitement
before
night
as
for
staying
here
my
home
you
know
is
where
he
needs
me
at
his
will
i
should
have
to
stay
here
altogether
but
i
wish
to
do
this
dear
father
it
is
of
the
greatest
necessity
to
my
nature
to
improve
my
intercourse
with
my
husband
while
he
is
sick
that
the
hasty
marriage
we
made
may
still
have
its
period
of
acquaintance
and
good
understanding
i
want
to
sound
the
possibilities
of
my
happiness
he
will
be
less
my
master
now
than
in
his
strength
and
possession
perhaps
vesta
voice
fell
and
she
turned
to
gaze
upon
the
bridegroom
whose
fever
still
consumed
his
wits
perhaps
i
can
influence
his
dress
his
appearance
you
mean
the
steeple
top
judge
custis
exclaimed
petulantly
at
the
loud
sound
of
this
familiar
word
the
feverish
man
ears
were
pierced
as
through
some
ventricle
like
an
old
wound
who
cried
he
muttered
oh
ca
you
see
i
married
hears
it
oh
spare
and
pity
her
he
wandered
into
the
miasmatic
world
again
leaving
them
all
touched
yet
oppressed
how
the
very
will
wear
away
before
the
judge
custis
finally
said
his
obdurate
heart
has
been
bruised
by
that
nickname
in
public
he
never
appeared
to
flinch
before
it
but
you
see
it
inflicted
a
wound
who
has
not
his
vulture
and
how
unjust
to
pursue
this
man
with
such
frivolous
inhospitality
so
many
years
vesta
exclaimed
her
splendid
eyes
flashing
no
account
has
been
made
of
his
private
reasons
his
family
piety
or
his
stern
taste
perhaps
for
he
must
have
a
reason
for
his
wardrobe
that
being
it
would
seem
the
only
thing
there
can
be
no
independence
about
did
you
hear
papa
his
feeling
for
me
but
this
moment
strangely
enough
my
own
mind
was
thinking
of
that
hat
it
seems
to
be
bigger
than
the
very
steeples
of
the
churches
it
rises
between
the
people
and
worship
yes
between
us
and
charity
and
faith
i
had
almost
said
hope
too
the
colored
people
all
say
that
hat
he
has
to
wear
because
the
devil
makes
him
the
trim
virgie
said
aunt
hominy
says
the
bad
man
would
let
him
make
no
mo
money
if
he
did
go
to
church
in
that
hat
some
of
the
white
people
says
so
too
you
do
believe
such
foolish
tales
as
that
virgie
vesta
asked
i
do
believe
anything
you
say
is
a
story
miss
vessy
hominy
believes
it
she
scared
out
of
her
life
about
milburn
coming
to
the
house
an
she
got
all
the
little
ones
a
most
crazy
with
fear
poor
dark
ignorant
soul
vesta
said
she
is
however
more
excusable
than
these
grown
men
whose
prejudices
against
an
article
of
dress
are
as
heathen
in
character
as
her
fetish
superstition
if
he
is
a
good
man
to
you
miss
vessy
the
slave
girl
said
think
the
bad
man
has
got
anything
to
do
with
him
if
he
treats
you
bad
i
think
the
bad
man
has
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
men
ought
to
have
been
left
wild
like
the
animals
the
judge
said
rinsing
out
milburn
mouth
with
a
piece
of
ice
for
the
obstacles
to
liberty
raised
by
fashion
and
civilization
are
asiatic
in
their
despotism
think
of
the
taxes
we
pay
to
fashion
when
we
refused
less
to
kings
think
of
the
aristocracy
based
upon
dress
after
we
have
formally
extirpated
it
by
statute
think
of
the
influence
the
and
of
europe
proceeding
from
the
courts
we
have
renounced
exert
upon
our
presidents
and
senators
and
through
the
women
of
this
country
upon
all
the
men
in
the
land
a
million
women
who
do
not
know
that
there
are
two
houses
of
congress
know
just
what
bonnet
the
duchess
is
wearing
and
how
charles
in
paris
ties
his
cravat
so
the
devil
always
gets
a
worm
in
every
apple
the
french
revolution
abolished
feudality
titles
great
landed
property
and
only
omitted
to
abolish
fashion
and
that
worm
a
silkworm
it
is
is
devastating
republican
government
everywhere
using
the
women
to
infect
us
yet
in
the
nature
of
woman
said
vesta
is
the
love
of
dress
as
strongly
as
the
love
of
woman
is
in
man
some
righteous
purpose
is
in
it
papa
to
ornament
ourselves
like
the
birds
and
let
art
be
born
god
knows
his
own
mysteries
judge
custis
said
but
vesta
go
home
with
me
to
your
own
comfortable
home
and
let
virgie
stay
here
to
keep
watch
master
i
afraid
to
stay
here
the
girl
exclaimed
sidling
towards
her
young
mistress
then
i
will
stay
and
be
nurse
the
judge
said
fear
not
i
will
give
him
only
wholesome
medicine
whatever
poison
he
has
given
me
and
mine
you
stay
in
teackle
hall
my
precious
child
indeed
i
must
command
it
vesta
smiled
sadly
and
pointed
to
her
husband
he
commands
me
now
papa
you
were
too
indulgent
a
master
and
spoiled
me
no
virgie
and
i
will
both
remain
and
you
conciliate
mamma
all
is
going
well
really
i
am
happy
and
grateful
to
my
heavenly
father
that
he
is
smoothing
the
way
so
gently
that
i
thought
would
be
so
hard
oh
the
conditions
of
this
disease
are
repulsive
my
child
you
are
a
lady
no
i
am
a
woman
said
vesta
that
man
and
i
must
see
one
or
the
other
die
you
do
not
know
how
easy
it
is
for
a
woman
to
nurse
a
man
though
love
might
make
the
task
more
grateful
yet
gratitude
will
do
much
to
sweeten
it
he
has
loved
me
and
taken
the
shadow
from
your
old
age
for
me
shall
i
leave
him
here
to
feel
that
i
despise
him
no
she
kissed
her
father
and
gave
him
his
cane
come
back
this
afternoon
my
love
she
said
to
him
nothing
on
earth
is
like
you
exclaimed
the
old
man
i
fear
you
are
not
mine
yes
vesta
said
you
are
full
of
good
wherever
you
may
have
strayed
as
the
sound
of
his
feet
passed
from
the
doorway
below
the
sick
man
with
a
sigh
as
from
burning
fire
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
around
they
fell
upon
her
picture
what
is
that
he
murmured
i
dreamed
nothing
like
that
just
now
it
is
my
picture
i
am
here
vesta
said
bending
over
him
do
you
know
me
who
are
you
dear
lady
he
breathed
with
and
mind
struggling
up
to
his
distended
orbs
do
i
know
you
yes
i
am
vesta
vesta
custis
i
was
i

his
eyes
opened
wide
as
if
hearing
some
wonderful
news
wife
what
is
that
my
wife
no
yes
i
am
vesta
milburn
your
wife
he
seemed
to
remember
and
with
compassion
for
him
she
stooped
and
kissed
him
god
bless
you
he
sighed
and
passed
away
into
the
upas
shades
again
at
that
minute
the
flew
in
the
open
window
and
fluttered
above
the
lowly
bed
and
perched
upon
the
headboard
and
began
to
sing

sunshine
that
he
had
never
seen
a
more
perfect
day
the
leaves
were
turning
on
the
great
and
the
maples
along
the
rise
in
the
road
wore
their
most
delicate
garments
of
nankeen
while
some
young
hickories
loaded
with
nuts
and
a
high
splendid
in
finery
beckoned
him
out
their
way
across
the
manokin
bridge
to
the
opposite
hill
where
the
presbyterian
church
overlooked
the
town
the
judge
whose
eyes
were
filled
with
happy
tears
partly
at
the
real
relief
to
his
circumstances
accomplished
by
vesta
great
sacrifice
and
partly
by
the
scene
just
closed
of
her
natural
honor
and
fidelity
to
the
man
who
had
forced
her
wedding
vows
from
her
took
the
northern
course
and
crossed
the
little
bridge
and
as
he
went
up
the
hill
the
environs
of
the
town
and
the
town
itself
spread
out
behind
him
in
the
stillness
of
the
sabbath
and
the
quails
and
fall
birds
piped
and
cackled
low
in
the
corn
and
the
grain
stubble
some
in
the
south
flew
over
the
low
gray
woods
towards
the
bay
a
pack
of
hounds
somewhere
bayed
like
distant
music
he
heard
the
turkeys
gobble
at
one
of
the
adjacent
farms
on
the
swells
in
the
marshy
landscape
where
abundance
not
otherwise
denoted
showed
in
the
fat
poultry
that
roosted
in
the
trees
like
living
fruit
and
spoke
apoplectically
while
he
drank
in
the
wine
of
autumn
on
the
air
that
had
a
bare
taste
of
frost
like
the
first
acid
in
the
sweet
cider
he
saw
a
carriage
or
two
come
over
the
level
roads
towards
princess
anne
and
the
told
their
errand
as
it
dropped
into
the
serenity
its
fruity
twang
like
a
pippin
rolling
from
the
bough
so
easily
so
musically
so
regularly
it
rang
like
the
voice
of
something
pure
that
was
steady
even
in
its
joys
that
the
judge
took
off
his
broad
white
fur
hat
as
if
to
a
lady
and
listened
with
something
between
courtesy
and
piety
as
the
bell
continued
other
carriages
came
towards
town
and
some
passed
him
their
inmates
all
bowing
and
often
stealing
a
look
back
to
see
judge
custis
again
the
first
man
in
the
county
they
looked
upon
an
humbled
heart
a
gladdened
soul
which
the
sharp
hand
of
affliction
had
made
to
bleed
while
an
unforeseen
providence
in
his
darling
child
had
kissed
the
wound
to
sleep
and
sucked
the
poison
from
it
raising
his
brow
towards
the
bright
blue
sky
as
if
he
could
not
raise
it
high
enough
to
feel
more
of
that
heavenly
rest
encinctured
there
the
judge
sighed
forth
a
happy
wish
like
the
kiss
of
love
after
a
quarrel
when
doubt
is
all
dispelled
or
wrong
forgiven
o
make
me
as
a
little
child
wash
out
my
stains
lead
me
in
the
path
my
child
has
walked
or
i
shall
never
see
her
in
the
life
to
come
his
lips
trembled
and
his
breast
heaved
convulsively
in
that
idea
of
being
unfit
to
enter
where
his
child
would
go
in
the
more
abundant
life
beyond
the
present
he
received
a
distinct
sermon
from
the
pulpit
of
nature
and
conscience
and
revelations
from
within
clearer
than
holy
scriptures
for
he
felt
the
justice
of
the
final
separation
of
the
impure
from
the
pure
and
the
faith
of
perseverance
in
good
to
draw
onward
towards
holiness
itself
and
perseverance
in
sensuality
and
selfishness
to
detain
the
spirit
in
its
husk
of
swine
his
agony
increased
where
shall
i
drift
if
i
go
on
he
said
playing
the
sleek
magistrate
and
family
head
and
loving
to
slip
away
in
the
dark
like
negroes
hunting
coons
by
night
what
is
escaping
discovery
to
the
increasing
degradation
of
my
own
sanctuary
my
created
spirit
can
i
find
the
way
i
have
wandered
down
and
retrace
my
steps
there
is
but
little
of
life
left
me
to
do
it
in
but
by
god
help
i
will
try
yes
this
golden
sabbath
i
will
do
something
to
begin
what
shall
it
be
he
put
on
his
hat
and
said
to
himself
i
will
go
to
the
methodist
they
work
directly
upon
the
conscience
deepen
the
sense
of
sin
and
preach
a
quick
cleansing
as
by
light
shining
in
there
i
may
grovel
in
the
sight
of
men
and
women
and
arise
redeemed
but
no
it
is
the
sabbath
my
daughter
marriage
is
to
be
announced
in
our
own
church
and
it
would
be
cowardly
not
to
say
unseemly
to
fly
from
one
worship
to
another
now
if
i
go
to
church
this
morning
it
must
be
to
our
own
is
there
any
excuse
but
cowardice
for
not
going
he
looked
into
his
debtor
nature
to
see
what
he
owed
to
anybody
that
might
be
owned
and
settled
this
day
slowly
and
almost
to
his
dislike
there
arose
an
obligation
to
his
wife
the
obligation
of
love
he
was
defrauding
her
of
if
indeed
he
loved
her
at
all
with
the
ardor
of
old
times
she
had
fretted
his
passion
away
in
little
sticklings
for
little
proprieties
and
narrowing
understanding
and
subservience
to
effeminate
social
traditions
she
jarred
upon
the
health
of
his
intellect
with
her
unsympathetic
refinements
and
pitiful
uncharities
and
fear
of
all
catholicity
she
was
gentility
itself
without
the
spark
of
nature
and
believing
that
she
inhabited
the
castle
towers
of
exclusiveness
and
social
righteousness
she
had
made
his
home
the
of
his
knighthood
at
once
the
loftiest
domestic
apartment
and
the
prison
nevertheless
she
was
his
wife
and
something
of
her
nature
must
be
in
vesta
though
the
judge
had
not
found
it
he
reflected
that
his
waywardness
might
have
sharpened
her
peculiarities
and
spread
the
distance
between
their
minds
till
deprived
of
a
husband
guidance
her
fluttered
woman
nature
had
quit
the
pasturage
of
the
fields
and
air
and
perched
upon
her
nest
and
vegetated
there
i
have
gone
away
from
her
he
said
and
complain
that
she
has
not
grown
i
have
myself
abounded
in
village
dignity
and
pretension
and
set
her
the
example
of
respecting
nothing
else
i
have
been
a
fraud
and
wonder
that
she
is
not
he
found
his
infirm
will
very
obdurate
against
making
love
to
his
wife
again
but
the
request
he
had
just
made
of
heaven
to
lead
him
into
the
right
steps
prevailed
upon
him
to
make
his
worship
at
home
this
morning
yes
he
said
i
will
start
right
she
is
sick
and
alone
and
vesta
taken
from
her
i
will
send
a
note
to
the
rector
to
announce
the
marriage
as
vesta
requested
and
do
my
worship
at
teackle
hall
this
day
the
manokin
spreading
wider
as
it
flowed
farther
from
the
town
and
widening
from
a
brook
to
a
creek
till
it
moistened
fringes
of
marsh
and
cut
low
bluffs
into
the
fields
never
seemed
to
invite
him
so
much
to
wander
along
its
sluices
as
this
morn
if
my
wife
would
only
walk
with
me
into
the
country
he
said
restlessly
how
more
companionable
we
would
have
been
to
each
other
but
she
can
not
walk
at
all
all
masculine
intercourse
ceased
between
us
years
ago
and
the
dull
small
range
of
household
talk
and
the
dynastic
gossip
of
the
good
families
wear
down
my
spirits
but
i
have
been
a
truant
husband
and
my
tongue
is
parched
by
dusty
rovings
in
prodigal
ways
let
me
woo
her
again
with
all
my
might
he
walked
through
princess
anne
worship
now
having
commenced
in
all
the
churches
and
saw
nobody
upon
the
street
except
a
divided
group
before
the
tavern
there
he
heard
jimmy
phoebus
speak
to
levin
dennis
sharply
levin
what

with
that
nigger
buyer
ai

no
dennis

the

process
on

even
if
his
enemy
had
not
been
helpless
in
bed

washing
levin
head
under
the
street
pump
plying
the

shampooing
him
with
alternate

jimmy
answered
levin
when
he
was
free
from

to

my
life
jack
wonnell
wearing
a
looked
on
with
timid
enjoyment
of
this
plain
talk
opening
his
mouth
to
grin
shutting
it
to
shudder
the
big
stranger
dropping
levin
dennis
strode
in
his
long
in
which
his
coarse
trousers
were
stuffed
right
to
the
front
of
jimmy
phoebus
and
glared
at
him
through
his
inflamed
and
unsightly
eye
jimmy
met
his
scowl
with
a
mildness
almost
amounting
to
contempt
hark
ye
spoke
the
stranger

been
a
picking
a
quarrel

and
nicked
his
kicks
into
the
bottom
of
his
gizzard
till
his
fell
into
my
mauleys
so
it
nish
or
knife
betwixt

bene
cove
he
put
his
hand
upon
his
hip
where

jimmy
phoebus

a
quick
pass
of
his
whittling
knife
to
the
giant
throat
raise

or
by
smoke

jugler
as
phoebus
spoke
he
lifted
one
foot
of
a
prodigious
size
as
deftly
as
an
elephant
hoisting
his
trunk
and
kicked
the
man
hand
from
the
hip
pocket
without
moving
either
his
own
body
or
countenance
it
was
done
so
automatically
that
the
other
turned
fiercely
to
see
who
kicked
him
and
his
partly
raised
was
flung
by
the
force
of
the
kick
several
yards
away
pick
up
his
knife
levin
jimmy
said
or
he
hurt
hisself
with
it
at
this
moment
judge
custis
came
up
and
pushed
the
two
powerful
men
apart
fighting
on
sunday
in
our
public
street
he
exclaimed
phoebus

language
hark
you
too
nigger
buyer
do
you
know
where
i
saw
you
first
for
the
first
time
a
flash
of
fire
came
from
the
pungy
captain
black
cherries
of
eyes
and
his
huge
broad
face
of
swarthy
color
expressed
its
full
oriental
character
the
last
time
i
saw
you
joe
johnson
was
not
in
judge
custis
kitchen
fur
no
good
nor
of
the
judge
visitor
milburn
of
the
it
was
the
on
the
public
green
of
georgetown
state
of
delaware
an
the
sheriff
of
it
over
your
back
an
after
he
sot
you
up
in
the
pillory
i
took
the
rottenest
egg
i
could
git
an
i
bust
it
right
on
the
eye
where
that
nigger
bruised
you
yisterday
the
oppressive
silence
as
joe
johnson
slunk
back
desperate
with
rage
yet
unable
to
deny
was
broken
by
jack
wonnell
unthinking
interjection
whoop
jimmy
hooraw
for
prencess
anne
an
why
did
i
git
that
egg
an
make
you
smell
it
joe
johnson
because
by
smoke
you
was
a
stinkin
kidnapper
robbing
of
the
pore
free
niggers
of
their
liberty
knowin
that
they
did
carry
no
arms
and
could
make
no
good
defense
that
your
trade
an
it
the
meanest
an
most
cowardly
in
the
world
it
doin
what
the
algerynes
does
in
fair
fighting
you
a
fine
american
citizen
ai
you
i
know
your
gang
and
a
bloody
one
it
is
but
you
ca
look
a
white
man
in
the
eye
because
you
a
thief
and
a
coward
the
hellenic
nature
of
the
bay
captain
had
never
displayed
itself
to
the
judge
with
this
fulness
and
he
felt
some
natural
admiration
as
he
took
phoebus
by
the
arm
well
well
said
the
judge
let
him
go
now
phoebus
johnson
do
let
me
see
you
in
princess
anne
again
continue
your
journey
and
disturb
us
no
more
or
i
shall
put
criminal
process
upon
you
and
you
see
we
have
stout
constables
in
somerset
as
he
led
phoebus
around
the
corner
of
the
bank
the
judge
said
james
my
wife
is
so
sick
that
i
must
keep
house
with
her
this
morning
and
i
want
a
little
note
left
at
the
church
for
tilghman
will
you
take
it
why
with
pleasure
judge
the
nonchalant
villager
replied
i
look
very
handsome
in
the
church
but
i
do
a
arrand
as
the
judge
wrote
the
note
with
his
gold
pencil
on
a
leaf
of
his
memorandum
book
he
said
james
did
you
identify
that
man
yesterday
yes
i
knowed
him
as
soon
as
he
come
to
the
tavern
this
mornin
seein
of
him
around
town
i
was
afear
samson
hat
would
stumble
on
him
and
the
nigger
buyer
would
kill
him
for
yisterday
blow
thinks
i
is
too
white
a
nigger
to
be
killed
that
way
by
smoke
but
the
prejudice
agin
a
nigger
hittin
a
white
man
is
sich
in
this
state
that
joe
johnson
bloody
as
he
is
would
never
have
stretched
hemp
for
samson
hat
so
i
picked
a
quarrel
with
the
nigger
buyer
to
take
the
fight
out
of
him
before
samson
should
come
he
wo
fight
nobody
now
in
this
town
is
done
you
took
a
great
risk
phoebus
he
is
such
an
evil
fellow
in
his
resentments
that
i
let
him
hide
and
eat
in
my
quarters
for
fear
of
some
ill
requital
if
i
refused
that
gang
of
patty
cannon
is
the
curse
of
the
eastern
shore
and
if
you
pardon
a
younger
and
a
porer
man
judge
it
jest
sich
gentlemen
as
you
that
lets
it
go
on
you
politicians
give
them
people
an
let
alone
because
they
fight
fur
you
in
times
an
air
popular
with
foresters
an
pore
trash
because
they
persecutes
niggers
an
treats
to
liquor
you
know
the
laws
is
agin
their
actions
on
both
sides
of
the
delaware
line
but
in
maryland
they
a
dead
letter
you
speak
plain
truth
james
phoebus
brave
as
your
conduct
but
the
poor
men
must
make
a
sentiment
against
these
kidnappers
because
among
the
ignorant
poor
they
find
their
defenders
and
equals
judge
the
pungy
captain
said
a
pangymonum
of
all
the
destreak
about
patty
cannon
by
smoke
it
a
shame
to
liberty
in
open
day
they
lead
free
niggers
men
wimmin
an
little
children
too
to
be
sold
who
free
as
my
mommy
and
your
daughter
judge
custis
thought
painfully
of
the
scant
freedom
his
daughter
now
enjoyed

commodo
decatur
was
a
big
man
for
of
it
up
by
smoke
they
sellin
more
free
people
to
death
and
hell
along
mason
and
dixon
line
than
up
the
whole
buzzum
of
the
mediterranean
sea
the
speaker
was
more
excited
now
than
he
had
been
during
all
the
collision
with
joe
johnson
indeed
phoebus
they
have
kidnapped
several
thousand
people
the
philadelphia
abolitionists
say
but
the
reports
must
be
exaggerated
the
demand
for
negroes
is
so
great
since
the
and
the
foreign
markets
have
made
cotton
a
great
staple
and
the
direct
importation
of
slaves
from
africa
has
been
stopped
that
there
is
a
great
run
for
negroes
and
free
colored
people
seldom
are
righted
when
they
have
been
pulled
across
the
line
they
never
are
righted
judge
custis
i
ashamed
of
my
native
state
only
a
few
years
ago
when
i
was
a
boy
people
around
yer
was
of
their
niggers
and
it
was
understood
that
slavery
would
out
an
everybody
said
the
evil
thing
go
but
niggers
began
to
go
up
high
they
got
to
be
wuth
eight
hunderd
dollars
whair
they
was
wuth
two
hunderd
and
all
the
politicians
begun
to
say
is
not
fit
to
be
free
niggers
is
the
bulrush
or
the
bulwork
or
of
our
nation
and
then
kidnapping
of
free
niggers
started
and
the
next
thing
they
kidnap
free
american
citizens
tut
tut
james
it
will
never
go
that
far
wo
it
what
did
joe
johnson
say
to
me
last
night
before
the
washington
tavern
he
said
sold
whiter
niggers
than
you
myself
i
kin
run
you
to
market
an
git
my
price
for
you
the
bay
sailor
took
off
his
hat
look
at
me
he
continued
by
smoke
look
on
my
brown
skin
and
black
eyes
an
coal
black
hair
whair
did
they
come
from
they
come
from
greece
whair
leonidas
an
marky
bozarris
and
all
them
fellers
came
from
that
what
my
daddy
said
he
know
better
than
me
i
but
a
pore
eastern
shore
man
sailing
my
little
vessel
but
i
a
man
and
i
tell
you
judge
it
a
dangerous
time
when
nothing
but
his
shade
of
color
protects
a
free
man
james
phoebus
the
judge
said
gravely
i
hope
you
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
think
all
these
things
outrages
and
they
grow
out
of
the
greater
outrage
of
slavery
itself
we
are
being
governed
by
new
states
hatched
in
the
southwest
from
the
alligator
eggs
of
old
slavery
that
had
grown
into
political
and
moral
disrepute
with
us
in
maryland
and
virginia
there
no
nigger
in
me
phoebus
said
putting
on
his
hat
but
i
have
taken
these
hints
about
my
looking
like
a
nigger
to
heart
and
take
a
nigger
part
when
he
is
imposed
on
as
if
he
was
some
of
the
body
and
blood
of
my
lord
jesus
now
you
hear
it
and
brave
enough
you
are
to
mean
it
my
honest
fellow
so
do
my
errand
and
james
chapter
xvi
man
as
the
judge
and
phoebus
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
bank
samson

appeared
driving
down
princess
anne
broad
main
street
a
young
white
girl
there
the
nigger
that
set
my
peep
in
limbo
muttered
the
negro
dealer
but
even
he
shall
go
past
this
accursed
town
is
packed
agin
me
he
took
a
long
look
at
samson
however
who
mildly
returned
it
in
the
most
respectful
manner
as
if
he
had
never
seen
the
strange
gentleman
before
and
now
my
pals
joe
johnson
said
turning
to
levin
dennis
and
jack

with
one
reluctant
look
towards
his
mother
cottage
he
led
the
way
into
the
country
little
was
said
as
they
walked
an
hour
or
more
towards
the
west
the
stranger
apparently
brooding
upon
his
indignities
and
twice
passing
around
the
jug
of
brandy
which
jack
wonnell
was
made
to
carry
and
before
noon
they
came
to
a
considerable
creek
out
in
which
was
anchored
a
small
vessel
bearing
on
her
stern
in
illiterate
often
inverted
letters
the
name
what
that
glibe
on
yonder
asked
johnson
pointing
to
the

levin
took
the
tiller
and
jack
wonnell
superserviceably
got
the
terrapin
tongs
and
stood
in
the
bow
while
the
skimmed
down
monie
creek
before
a
good
breeze
and
a
lee
tide
the
chain
dredge
for
terrapin
was
thrown
over
the
side
but
the
boat
made
too
much
sail
for
wonnell
to
take
more
than
one
or
two
tardy
animals
with
his
tongs
as
they
hovered
around
the
transparent
bottoms
making
ready
for
their
winter
descent
into
the
mud
take
up

dredge
johnson
commanded
in
a
few
minutes
it
makes

slow
jack
wonnell
obediently
made
a
few
turns
on
the
windlass
and
as
the

came
up
two
terrapin
of
the
then
common
variety
rolled
on
the

and
a
skilpot
that
enough
tarrapins
johnson
said
unless

afraid
doin
wrong
levin
say
spooney
is
it
wicked
now
the
boy
laughed
a
little
pale
of
face
and
johnson
closed
his
remark
with
nawthin
ai
wicked

shudder
pass
through
him
but
he
gave
the
stranger
the
helm
and
by
wonnell
aid
raised
the
and
the
light

winging
across

atmosphere
several
times
with
deep
unction
and
ended
by
a
low
whoop
and
whistle
and
looked
at
levin
dennis
with
one
eye
shut
as
if
to
get
levin
opinion
of
all
this
well
levin
said

yes
levin
you

brandy
as
much
as
i
likes
the
gals
you
go
off
for
tarrapin
an
taters
an
oysters
an
peddles
aroun
prencess
anne
an
then
somebody
pulls
you
in
the
an
away

money
an
your
mother
ai
got
no
tea
and
coffee
jack
said
levin
abruptly
do
you
believe
in
ghosts
i
do
know
levin
if
i
saw
one
maybe
i
would
but
i
too
trashy
for
ghosts
to
see
me
well
now
levin
said
there
a
ghost
or
something
that
looks
out
for
mother
when
i
drunk
or
gone
an
it
leaves
tea
and
coffee
in
the
window
for
her
sho
why
levin
that
jimmy
phoebus
he
ben
in
love
with
your
mother
for
years
an
she
wo
have
him
but
he
keep
a
hangin
on
he
your
mother
ghost
no
jack
i
thought
it
was
till
jimmy
come
to
me
an
asked
me
who
i
guessed
it
was
he
was
a
little
jealous
i
reckon
i
said
you
of
course
jimmy
says
he
smoke
i
do
do
any
like
that
what
i
give
i
go
and
give
with
no
sneakin
about
it
or
prying
into
ellanory
poverty
he
was
right
down
mad
but
he
find
nothing
out
so
i
think
it
may
be
the
ghost
of
father
drowned
at
sea
bringing
tea
and
coffee
and
sometimes
a
dress
and
a
pair
of
shoes
too
to
keep
mother
warm
levin
dennis
standing
against
the
tiller
seemed
to
jack
wonnell
to
be
fair
and
spiritual
as
a
woman
as
his
comely
brow
and
large
eyes
grew
serious
with
this
relation
of
his
father
mysterious
fate
his
dark
auburn
hair
in
short
ringlets
parted
in
the
middle
gave
his
sunburnt
countenance
a
likeness
to
some
of
the
old
gentle
families
with
which
he
was
allied
his
father
having
been
a
son
of
younger
sons
in
a
date
when
primogeniture
prevailed
in
all
this
bay
region
and
therefore
possessing
nothing
he
went
into
the
war
against
england
as
a
sailor
and
his
family
influence
obtained
for
him
command
of
the
new
privateer
launched
on
the
manokin
the
which
set
sail
with
a
good
crew
and
superior
armament
amid
the
acclaims
of
all
somerset
and
sailing
past
the
capes
into
the
ocean
with
all
her
bunting
flying
slid
down
the
farther
world
to
everlasting
silence
and
the
vapors
of
mystery
his
widow
waited
long
and
patiently
with
this
only
boy
levin
a
scarcely
lisping
child
and
stories
of
every
kind
were
current
that
the
captain
had
been
captured
and
hanged
by
the
enemy
and
the
ship
burned
or
condemned
that
he
had
hoisted
the
black
flag
and
become
a
pirate
and
quit
the
western
world
for
the
east
india
waters
and
finally
that
the
foundered
off
guiana
and
every
soul
was
drowned
the
widow
a
beautiful
woman
neglected
by
her
husband
connection
who
were
sullen
at
the
loss
of
their
investment
and
their
expected
profits
from
the
vessel
lived
in
the
little
house
she
had
owned
before
her
marriage
and
sank
into
the
plainer
class
of
people
almost
losing
her
identity
with
the
ruling
families
to
which
her
son
was
kin
but
in
her
humbler
class
highly
respected
and
solicited
in
marriage
she
was
still
young
and
fair
and
jimmy
phoebus
a
hale
bachelor
and
captain
of
a
trading
schooner
had
endeavored
to
marry
her
for
years
and
held
on
to
his
hope
patiently
exercising
many
kind
offices
for
her
though
his
means
were
limited
and
he
had
poor
kin
looking
to
him
for
help
she
feared
the
absent
lover
might
be
alive
and
return
to
find
her
another
wife
so
her
son
growing
up
without
a
father
discipline
and
being
too
respectable
it
was
supposed
to
put
to
a
trade
or
be
indentured
lived
by
fugitive
pursuits
on
land
and
water
hauling
and
peddling
vegetables
and
provisions
at
times
and
now
by
the
gift
of
jimmy
phoebus
he
sailed
his
little
sloop
or
chiefly
to
carry
terrapin
to
baltimore
rough
sailor
acquaintances
exposure
a
credulous
easily
led
nature
and
almost
total
neglect
of
school
at
a
time
when
education
was
a
high
privilege
had
made
him
wayward
and
often
intemperate
but
without
developing
any
selfish
or
cruel
characteristics
and
being
of
an
agreeable
exterior
and
affable
disposition
he
fell
a
prey
to
any
strangers
who
might
be
in
town
gunners
negro
buyers
idle
planters
and
spreeing
overseers
many
of
whom
hired
his
company
and
vessel
to
take
their
excursions
and
while
loving
his
mother
and
being
her
only
reliance
she
saw
him
slipping
further
and
further
into
manhood
without
steadiness
or
education
or
fixed
principles
or
any
female
influence
to
draw
him
to
domestic
constraints
his
slender
supple
figure
and
marks
of
gentility
in
his
limbs
and
shapely
brow
and
large
gentle
eyes
poorly
consorted
with
ragged
clothes
bare
feet
and
absolute
dependence
on
chance
employment
the
latter
becoming
more
precarious
as
his
age
and
stature
made
more
demands
for
money
through
his
false
appetites
jack
said
levin
dennis
what
do
you
mean
by
gittin
money
to
buy
roxy
custis
you
never
git
no
money
wo

jack
wonnell
indicated
the
hatchway
down
which
joe
johnson
had
gone
he
got
bags
of
it
him
why
jack
how
much
money
do
you

beautiful
servant

her
five
dollars
why
you

fool
she

hundred
dollars

thousands
this
nigger
trader
with
all
his
gold
would
be
hard
pushed
i
to
buy
roxy
jack
looked
downcast
and
failed
to
wink
or
whistle
gals
like
her
said
levin
goes
for
mistresses
to
rich
men
sometimes
they
eddicates
i
hearn
tell
to
know
music
writin
an
grammar
an
them
things
and
a
pore
man
who
would
abuse

white
like

respect
her
an
marry
her
too
levin
they
makes
laws
agin
him
maybe
i
kin
steal
roxy
here
jack
whistled
low
shut
one
eye
with
deep
knowingness
and
grinned
behind
his
oh
you
simpleton
levin
said
where
could
you
take
her
to
pennsylvany
cannydy
turkey
or
some
of
them
abolition
states
up
thar
jack
wonnell
indicated
the
north
with
his
finger
ai
there
no
place
where
a
white
man
kin
treat
a
slave
like
that
as
if
they
both
was
a
christian
no
answered
levin
not
in
this
world
the
hero
of
the
was
much
affected
and
levin
thought
he
really
was
whimpering
though
his
vacant
grin
was
a
poor
frame
for
grief
jack
said
levin
if
what
roxy
custis
told
is
true
the
gal
is
the
slave
of
your
pertickler
enemy
meshach
milburn
the
wearer
of
the
rival
species
of
hat
was
badly
sobered
as
levin
mentally
expressed
it
at
this
dismal
solution
of
his
gentle
dreams
of
love
he
arose
and
walked
to
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
looked
down
into
the
flying
waves
over
which
the
skipped
as
if
he
might
seek
the
solution
of
his
own
disconnected
yet
harmless
life
in
the
bottom
of
the
sound
among
the
oyster
rocks
the
water
was
now
speckled
with
canoes
and
periaugers
pirogues
and
little
coming
from
deil
island
preaching
and
before
them
rose
out
of
the
bay
the
low
woody
islands
and
capes
which
with
white
straits
between
enclose
from
the
long
blue
nave
of
the
chesapeake
the
scalloped
aisle
called
tangier
sound
like
pigeons
and
wrens
around
some
cathedral
the
flew
in
these
involuted
almost
fantastic
architectures
of
archipelago
and
peninsula
which
lying
flat
to
the
water
yet
took
ragged
perspective
there
as
if
some
gothic
builder
had
laid
his
foundations
but
had
not
bent
the
tall
pines
together
that
grew
above
in
groves
to
make
the
groined
roofs
and
arches
of
his
design
here
could
be
seen
the
ospreys
sailing
in
graceful
pairs
above
the
herrings
or
the
old
wives
shoals
taking
with
elegance
and
conscientiousness
the
daily
animal
food
that
even
man
demands
with
all
his
sentiments
and
gospels
there
the
duck
in
a
little
flock
broke
the
sabbath
to
dive
for
the
wild
celery
that
grows
beneath
the
sound
in
yonder
tree
the
bald
eagle
was
starting
out
upon
his
algerine
work
of
vehemence
and
piety
to
intercept
the
hawk
and
steal
his
cargo
the
wild
swan
might
be
those
faint
far
birds
flying
so
high
over
kedge
straits
in
the
south
and
the
black
loon
spreading
his
wings
like
a
demon
disappears
close
to
the
and
rises
no
more
till
memory
has
forgotten
him
levin
dennis
steered
close
to
a
point
where
he
had
been
wont
to
scatter
food
for
the
black
ducks
and
draw
them
to
the
gunner
ambush
sheldrakes
and
goosanders
coots
and
gulls
whifflers
and
dippers
made
the
best
of
sunday
and
bathed
and
wrote
their
winged
penmanship
on
the
white
sheet
of
water
poor
jack
wonnell
returning
with
something
on
his
face
between
a
grin

chapter
xvii
sabbath
and
canoe
they
now
approached
an
island
with
low
bluffs
on
which
appeared
a
considerable
village
shining
whitely
amid
the
straight
brown
trunks
of
a
grove
of
but
no
people
seemed
moving
about
it
and
they
saw
but
a
single
vessel
at
anchor
in
the
thoroughfare
or
strait
they
steered
into
a
canoe
which
revealed
on
her
bow
as
they
rounded
to
beside
her
a
word
neither
levin
nor
jack
could
read

by
hearsay
jack

brandy
mooring
against

shore
levin
went
to
his
passenger
who
was
still
in
deep
sleep
stretched
upon
the
bare
floor
of
the
hold
or
cabin
a
brawny
wiry
man
with
strong
chin
and
long
jaws
and
his
reddish
dark
beard
matted
with
the
blood
that
had
spilled
from
his
disfigured
eye
and
now
disguised
nearly
one
half
his
face
and
gave
him
a
wild
bandit
look
mister
boss
wake
up

have
come
to
deil
island
the
long
man
lying
on
his
back
seemed
unable
to
turn
over
upon
his
side
though
he
muttered
in
his
stirred
sleep
such
words
as
levin
could
not
understand
the
darbies
patty
make
haste
with
them
darbies
put
the
nippers
on
her
wrists
an
twist
ha
the
mort
is

to
the
garden
with

he
awoke
and
turned
his
cold
light
eyes
on
levin
and
leaped
to
his
feet
did
you

he
cried
it

like
the
man
with
the
poker
was
joe
johnson
gave
him
the
jug
and
held
it
up
and
the
boy
drank
like
one
desperate
how
the
young
jagger
lushes
his
jockey
the
tall
man
muttered
in
job
dock
i
take
no
more
a
bloody
fool
i
was
all
yesterday
an
oaring
with
my
what
place
is

politeness

then

take
this
piece
of
money
an
go
to
some
house
an
fetch
us
a
bite
of
dinner
we
wait
fur
you
the
tall
man
led
the
way
to
the
heart
of
the
grove
of
pines
where
the
seeming
town
was
found
a
deserted
religious
encampment
of
durable
wooden
shells
or
huts
in
concentric
circles
of
horseshoe
shape
and
at
the
open
end
of
the
circle
was
the
a
shed
elevated
above
the
empty
benches
and
pegs
of
removed
benches
and
which
had
a
wide
shelf
running
across
the
whole
front
for
the
preacher
bible
and
to
receive
his
thwacks
as
he
walked
up
and
down
his
platform
it
looked
a
little
mysterious
now
with
the
many
evidences
of
a
large
human
occupation
in
the
recent
summer
to
see
this
naked
town
and
hollow
pulpit
lying
so
suggestively
under
the
long
moan
of
the
conferring
together
like
dread
angels
in
council
and
expressing
at
every
rising
breeze
their
impatience
with
the
sins
of
men
at
times
the
great
branches
paused
awhile
scarcely
murmuring
as
if
they
were
brooding
on
some
question
propounded
in
their
council
or
listening
to
human
witnesses
below
and
then
they
would
gravely
converse
as
the
regular
zephyrs
moved
in
and
out
among
them
and
pause
again
as
if
their
decision
was
almost
dreaded
by
themselves
at
intervals
a
stern
spirit
in
the
pines
would
rise
and
thunder
and
shake
the
shafts
of
the
trees
and
others
would
answer
him
and
patience
would
have
a
season
again
and
so
with
scarcely
ever
a
silence
that
remained
more
than
a
moment
this
council
went
on
all
day
continued
all
night
was
resumed
as
the
sun
arose
to
comfort
the
world
again
ceased
not
when
the
rainbow
hung
out
its
perennial
assurance
upon
the
storm
and
typified
to
trembling
worshippers
the
great
synod
of
the
creator
in
everlasting
session
ready
to
smite
the
world
with
fire
but
suspending
sentence
in
the
evergreen
pity
of
god
in
one
of
the
deserted
shells
or
tents
of
pine
with
neatly
shingled
roof
facing
the
joe
johnson
and
levin
dennis
found
benches
and
at
the
tall
man
example
levin
also
lighted
a
pipe
and
looked
out
between
the
escapes
of
smoke
at
tangier
sound
deserted
as
this
on
the
sabbath
since
the
worshippers
had
reached
home
from
church
in
their
canoes
he
thought
of
his
lonely
mother
in
the
town
of
princess
anne
wondering
where
he
was
and
of
the
sundays
fast
speeding
by
and
bringing
him
to
manhood
with
no
change
in
their
condition
for
the
better
but
penury
and
disappointment
a
vague
expectation
of
the
dead
to
return
and
deeper
intemperance
of
the
dead
man
son
and
widow
only
hope
he
would
have
cried
out
with
a
sense
of
misery
contagious
from
the
music
of
those
pines
above
him
perhaps
if
the
brandy
had
not
begun
to
creep
along
his
veins
and
shine
bold
in
his
large
girlish
eyes
levin
said
joe
johnson
do
you
like
me

i

to
fix
you

your
mother

an

to
be
stabled
on
gold
oats
he
drew
the
canvas
bag
of
eagles
and
out
of
his
trousers
and
held
its
mouth
open
for
levin
to
feast
his
eyes

exclaimed
with
disgust

he
pressed
the
gold
pieces
ostentatiously
upon
the
boy
who
looked
at
them
with
fear
yet
fascination
what

to
do

how
fur

it
to
prencess
anne
what
time
kin
you
make
it
levin
stepped
out
of
the
shanty
and
looked
at
the
wind
and
water
his
pulses
all
between
the
strong
brandy
and
the
wonderful
gold
in
his
pocket
and
as
he
watched
the
veering
of
the
to
see
which
way
they
moved
their
moaning
seemed
to
be
the
voice
of
his
widowed
mother
by
her
kitchen
fire
that
day
saying
he
is
in
trouble
where
is
my
son
why
stays
he
o
my
levin
the
tide
is
on
the
stand
an
will
turn
in
half
an
hour
it
will
take
us
up
the
manokin
with
this
wind
by
dark
ef
we
can
get
water
enough
in
the
thoroughfare
without
going
around
by
little
deil
johnson
came
out
and
made
the
same
observations
on
wind
and
flood
i
reckon
it
eighteen
miles
to
the
head
of
deep
water
on
manokin
levin
not
quite
sir
through
the
thoroughfare
it
nigh
eighteen
we
got
four
hours
and
a
half
of
daylight
yet
then
stand
for
the
head
of
manokin
an
obey
all
my
orders
like
a
man
an
i
git
ye
and
yer
mother
a
plantation
an
stock
it
with
niggers
for
you
come
brace
up
again
he
offered
the
and
encouraged
the
boy
to
drink
heartily
and
affected
to
do
the
same
himself
though
it
was
but
a
feint
while
they
stood
in
the
shelter
of
the
camp
cottage
going
through
this
pastime
a
voice
from
near
at
hand
resounded
through
the
woods
and
made
their
blood
stop
to
circulate
for
an
instant
on
the
arrested
heart
it
was
a
voice
making
a
prayer
at
a
high
pitch
as
if
intended
to
cover
all
the
and
be
heard
to
the
outermost
bounds
the
sincerity
of
the
sound
made
levin
dennis
feel
that
the
camp
might
still
be
inhabited
by
some
spiritual
congregation
which
the
eyes
of
profane
visitors
could
not
see
the
remainder
of
the
saints
the
souls
of
the
converted
or
an
ethereal
host
from
above
the
solemn
organ
of
the
pines
the
idea
had
scarcely
seized
upon
him
when
a
fluttering
of
wings
was
heard
and
on
the
old
alighted
a
flock
of
white
they
balanced
their
large
deacon
and
bodies
upon
the
empty
seats
and
there
set
up
as
grave
a
squawking
as
if
they
were
singing
a
hymn
with
that
indifferent
knowledge
of
harmony
possessed
by
choristers
the
accident
of
their
coming
no
unusual
thing
on
these
exposed
islands
might
have
made
untroubled
people
only
laugh
but
it
produced
the
contrary
effect
on
both
our
visitors
levin
felt
a
superstitious
fear
seize
upon
him
and
turning
to
joe
johnson
he
saw
that
person
with
a
face
so
pale
that
it
showed
his
eye
yet
darker
and
more
hideous
like
a
brand
upon
his
countenance
gazing
upon
the
late
empty
there
levin
turning
his
eyes
observed
a
solitary
man
kneeling
of
a
plain
appearance
and
dress
and
with
locks
of
womanly
hair
falling
carelessly
upon
a
large
and
almost
noble
forehead
his
arms
raised
to
heaven
and
his
voice
flowing
out
in
a
mellow
stream
of
supplication
in
the
intervals
of
which
the
geese
could
be
heard
quacking
aloud
and
paddling
their
wings
as
they
balanced
and
hopped
over
the
arena
who
he
a
prayin
to
levin
asked
of
joe
johnson
quemar
muttered
johnson
as
if
he
were
terrified
at
something
his
is
swallerin
ghosts
curse
on
the
swaddler
the
kid
will
whindle
directly
come
boy
come
at
this
seizing
levin
hand
partly
in
persuasion
partly
as
if
he
wanted
the
lad
protection
johnson
fairly
trembling
ran
for
the
boat
levin
was
frightened
too
the
more
that
he
saw
the
stronger
man
fear
as
they
dashed
across
the
the
took
alarm
and
some
running
some
flying
scudded
towards
the
sound
a
voice
from
the
pulpit
cried
after
the
retreating
men
but
only
to
increase
their
fears
and
when
they
leaped
on
board
the
joe
johnson
was
livid
with
terror
he
ran
partly
down
the
and
stopped
to
look
back
the
were
now
spreading
their
wings
like
a
fleet
of
fleecy
sails
and
fluttering
down
the
sound
in
gallant
convoy
what
did
you
run
for
levin
said
the
jug
of
brandy
is
left
it
was
only
parson
thomas
you
run
first
the
man
replied
gasping
for
breath
and
a
little
ashamed
what
did
he
preach
at
me
fur
that
the
parson
of
the
islands
levin
said

started

off
ordered
joe
johnson
my
teeth
are
most
with
the
chill
that
mace
cove
give
me
he
pulled
up
the
anchor
hoisted
the
jib
and
showed
such
nervous
apprehension
that
levin
subsided
to
managing
the
helm
and
steered
down
the
thoroughfare
or
strait
which
for
some
distance
wound
around
the
grove
yer
jack
wonnell
comin
with
the
jug
and
the
dinner
we
wait
fur
him
he
got
the
cove
with
him
no
stop
for
nothing
but
the
boat
had
to
stop
as
her
keel
scraped
the
mud
in
the
almost
dry
thoroughfare
and
a
plain
island
man
of
benevolent
nearly
credulous
face
hailed
them
saying
stutteringly
be
that
we
yer
wonnell
bringin
your
taters

of

exclaimed

with

of

looking

they

a

if

they
now
sailed
out
of
the
thoroughfare
into
the
broad
mouth
of
the
manokin
where
a
calm
fell
upon
air
and
water
for
a
little
while
and
they
could
hear
smothered
music
as
of
beneath
the
water
beating
thum

and
crabs
and
alewives
rose
to
the
surface
around

chased
by

into

of

creek
where
rock
and
perch
were
running
on
the
top
of
the

with
the
tongs
jack

raised
half
a
bushel
of
oysters
in

dips
and
opened

for

haws
and
wild

thousands
of

chapter
xviii
under
an
old
bonnet
vesta
had
been
sitting
half
an
hour
beside
her
unconscious
husband
listening
to
his
broken
speech
and
thinking
upon
the
rapidity
of
events
once
started
on
their
course
like
eaglets
scarcely
taught
to
fly
before
they
attack
and
kill
when
the
sound
of
arrested
at
the
door
called
her
to
the
window
and
tom
the
which
had
been
comparatively
quiet
since
he
found
his
master
snugly
cared
for
now
began
to
hop
about
fly
in
the
air
and
sing
again
sweet
sweet
sweetie
come
see
come
see
vesta
saw
meshach
wiry
deliberate
colored
man
step
down
and
turn
the
horses
heads
and
there
dropped
from
the
carriage
without
using
the
at
a
leap
and
a
skip
a
young
female
object
whose
head
was
invisible
in
an
enormous
bonnet
of
figured
blue
chintz
however
quick
she
executed
the
leap
vesta
observed
that
the
arrival
had
forgotten
to
put
on
her
stockings
before
vesta
could
turn
from
the
window
this
singular
object
had
darted
up
the
dark
stairs
of
the
old
storehouse
and
thrown
herself
on
the
delirious
man
bed
uncle
uncle
meshach
air
you
dead
uncle
wake
up
and
kiss
your
rhudy
she
had
kissed
her
uncle
plentifully
while
awaiting
the
same
of
him
and
the
attack
a
little
excited
him
without
recalling
his
mind
to
any
sustained
remembrance
though
vesta
heard
the
words
dear
child
before
he
turned
his
head
and
chased
the
wild
poppies
again
then
the
young
female
ejaculating
lord
sakes
uncle
do
know
his
rhudy
pulled
her
black
apron
over
her
head
and
had
a
silent
cry
a
little
convulsion
of
the
neck
and
not
an
audible
sigh
besides
she
weeps
with
some
refinement
vesta
thought
and
also
observed
that
the
visitor
was
a
tall
rather
sightly
girl
of
probably
seventeen
with
clothing
the
mantuamaker
was
guiltless
of
and
a
hoop
bonnet
such
as
old
people
continued
to
make
in
remembrance
of
the
vessels
which
had
brought
the
last
styles
to
them
when
their
ancestors
emigrated
with
their
all
and
forever
from
a
land
of
the
bonnet
was
a
remarkable
object
to
vesta
though
she
had
seen
some
such
at
a
distance
coining
in
upon
the
heads
of
the
forest
people
to
the
methodist
church
it
resembled
the
ship
of
columbus
which
he
had
built
so
high
on
purpose
the
girls
at
the
seminary
said
so
as
to
have
the
advantage
of
spying
the
new
world
first
but
it
also
resembled
the
long
hollow
conestoga
wagons
of
which
vesta
had
seen
so
many
going
past
her
at
ellicott
mills
before
the
late
new
railroad
had
quite
reached
there
as
she
had
often
peered
into
those
vast
wagons
to
see
what
creatures
might
be
passengers
in
their
depths
so
she
took
the
first
opportunity
of
the
blue
scuttle
being
jolted
up
by
the
mourner
to
discern
the
face
within
it
was
a
pretty
face
with
a
pair
of
feeling
and
also
mischievous
brown
eyes
set
in
the
attitude
of
wonder
the
moment
they
observed
another
woman
in
the
room
the
skin
was
pale
the
mouth
generous
the
nose
long
like
milburn
but
not
so
emphatic
and
the
neck
brow
and
form
of
the
face
longish
and
with
something
fine
amid
the
wild
stare
she
fixed
on
vesta
exclaiming
in
a
whisper
lord
sakes
a
lady
yer
then
she
threw
her
apron
over
the
conestoga
bonnet
again
and
held
it
up
there
with
her
long
fingers
and
long
plump
wrists
vesta
looked
on
with
the
first
symptoms
of
amusement
she
had
felt
since
the
morning
she
and
her
mother
laughed
at
the
hat
as
they
looked
down
from
the
windows
of
teackle
hall
upon
the
man
already
her
husband
that
morning
seemed
a
year
ago
it
was
but
yesterday
old
hats
and
bonnets
vesta
thought
will
be
no
novelties
to
me
by
and
by
this
family
of
the
milburns
is
full
of
them
then
addressing
the
new
arrival
vesta
said
this
is
your
uncle
then
where
do
you
live
i
live
at
nu
answered
the
miss
taking
down
the
black
apron
and
looking
from
the
depths
of
the
bonnet
like
a
from
his
hole
if
she
had
said
ark
without
the
vesta
thought
it
would
have
seemed
natural
your
uncle
has
a
high
fever
vesta
said
kindly
he
is
not
in
danger
we
think
it
was
right
of
you
to
come
however
now

off
your
bonnet

ark
at
this
the
girl
carefully
extricated
her
head
from
the
conestoga
scuttle
looked
all
over
the
bonnet
with
pride
and
anxiety
and
then
carefully
laid
it
on
the
top
of
her
uncle
uncle
meshach
give
it
to
me
she
said
with
a
sly
inclination
towards
the
sick
bed

bought

the
stuff

somers
draw
it
did
you
ever

folks
out

sech
extravagins
but

but

rhudy

somers

but
draw
mour
here
rhoda
gave
a
repetition
of
what
vesta
had
twice
before
observed
an
inaudible
sniffle
and
being
caught
in
it
wiped
her
nose
on
her
apron
take
my
handkerchief
vesta
said
you
are
cold
and
passed
over
her
cambric
with
a
lace
border
what
it
fur
rhoda
asked
looking
at
it
superstitiously
you
wipe
your
nuse
on
it
do
you
lord
sakes
ai
it
a
piece
of
your
neck
fixin
vesta
felt
in
a
good
humor
to
see
this
weed
of
nature
turn
the
handkerchief
over
and
hold
it
by
the
thumb
and
finger
as
if
she
might
become
accountable
for
anything
that
might
happen
to
it
i
got
two
of
these

said
misc
somers

fire
and

your
ride
from
the
oceanside
this
cold
morning
through
the
forests
of
the
pocomoke
must
have
chilled
you
through
lay
off
your
blanket
shawl
rhoda
laid
the
huge
black
and
green
shawl
that
reached
to
her
feet
on
the
green
chest
and
smoothed
it
with
evident
pride
uncle
meshach
bought
that
in
wilminton
she
said
ai
it
beautiful
i
never
wear
it
but
when
i
come
over
yer
or
go
to
snow
hill
snow
sech
a
proud
place
she
had
a
way
of
laughing
by
merely
indenting
her
cheeks
without
a
sound
just
as
she
expressed
the
sense
of
pain
the
only
difference
being
in
the
beaming
of
her
eyes
and
vesta
thought
it
had
something
contagious
in
it
she
would
laugh
broadly
and
in
silence
as
if
she
had
been
put
on
behavior
in
church
and
there
had
adopted
a
grimace
to
make
the
other
girls
laugh
and
save
herself
the
suspicion
as
she
pulled
her
skirts
down
to
her
feet
vesta
observation
was
confirmed
that
rhoda
had
no
stockings
on
and
she
could
not
help
exclaiming
my
dear
child
what
possessed
you
to
ride
this
october
morning
only
half
dressed
you
might
catch
your
death
rhoda
caught
her
nose
on
the
half
sniffle
raised
and
dimpled
her
cheeks
in
a
sly
laugh
and
cried
lord
sakes
you
mean
my
legs
why
i
ai
got
but
two
pairs
of
stockings
an
misc
somers
is
a
wearin
one
of
em
and
the
ould
in
the
wash
it
so
tejus
to
knit
stockings
and
sech
fun
to
go
barefoot
that
i
do
wear
em
unless
misc
somers
finds
it
out
why
the
boys
ca
see
me
she
grimaced
again
so
naturally
and
engagingly
that
vesta
had
to
laugh
quite
aloud
and
saw
meantime
that
the
young
woman
shoes
covered
a
slender
foot
a
lady
might
have
envied
now
rhoda
vesta
said
almost
indignantly
why
did
you
not
ask
your
wealthy
uncle
for
some
good
yarn
stockings
him
why
he
got
so
many
pore
kin
if
he
begin
to
give
em
all
stockings
he
go
barefoot
himself
has
he
other
nieces
like
you
no
the
girl
quietly
grimaced
with
her
brown
eyes
full
of
laughter
there
plenty
of
others
but
none
like
rhudy
the
woods
is
full
of
them
others
so
you
are
the
favorite
now
what
was
your
uncle
going
to
do
with
all
his
money
lord
sakes
rhoda
said
he
was
going
to
marry
miss
vesty
with
it
that
what
misc
somers
said
the
had
been
striking
up
once
or
twice
in
the
conversation
and
now
pealed
his
note
loud
vesta
she
she
she
a
tingle
of
that
superstition
she
had
felt
more
than
once
already
in
her
brief
knowledge
of
this
forest
family
went
through
vesta
veins
and
nerves
and
she
silently
remarked
how
little
a
young
girl
knows
of
men
around
her
what
satyrs
are
taking
her
image
to
their
arms
these
people
knew
he
loved
me
when
i
knew
not
that
he
ever
saw
me
she
addressed
the
niece
again
rhoda
did
your
uncle
say
he
loved
miss
vesta
no
he
never
said
he
luved
nothing
but
i
heard
tom
the
shout
and
saw
a
lady
picture
yonder
between
grandpar
and
grandmem
and
told
misc
somers
and
she
says
uncle
meshach
in
luve
oh
i
was
right
glad
of
it
because
he
was
so
sad
and
lonesome
the
fountain
of
sympathy
burst
up
again
in
vesta
heart
and
she
felt
that
there
were
compensations
riches
and
station
knew
not
of
in
humble
alliances
like
hers
rhoda
she
said
going
to
the
young
girl
and
putting
her
hand
upon
her
soft
brown
hair
you
have
not
noticed
the
new
picture
of

vesta
i
am
your
new
aunt
the
girl
made
one
of
her
engaging
dimpled
silent
laughs
as
if
by
stealth
again
changed
it
into
a
silent
cry
by
a
revulsion
as
natural
and
rose
to
her
feet
and
took
vesta
in
her
arms
i
so
glad
i
will
cry
a
little
rhoda
simpered
her
eyes
all
dewy
oh
how
misc
somers
will
say
found
it
out
first
tom
kept
up
a
whistling
little
cry
as
if
he
had
his
own
thoughts
sweety
sweety
sweet
vesty
see
see
see
vesta
felt
a
chain
of
happy
thoughts
arise
in
her
mind
which
she
expressed
as
frankly
as
the
girl
of
forest
product
had
spoken
that
she
might
not
retard
the
welcome
of
these
homely
friendships
yes
rhoda
i
am
thankful
to
find
a
social
life
open
to
me
where
there
seemed
no
way
and
brooks
and
playmates
where
everything
looked
dry
you
come
here
like
a
sunbeam
god
bless
you
i
can
hear
you
talk
and
teach
you
what
little
i
know
and
we
will
relieve
each
other
watching
him
she
felt
a
slight
modification
of
her
joy
at
this
reminder
but
the
bird
seemed
to
teach
her
patience
as
he
suggested
hopping
and
flying
in
the
air
come
see
come
see
come
see
yes
thought
vesta
and
see
it
is
good
counsel
i
begin
to
feel
the
breaking
of
a
new
sense
curiosity
about
the
poor
and
lowly
my
education
seems
to
have
closed
my
observation
on
people
of
my
own
race
who
daily
trode
almost
upon
my
skirts
and
whom
i
never
saw
whom
it
was
considered
respectable
not
to
see
while
even
my
colored
servants
enjoyed
my
whole
confidence
because
they
were
my
slaves
yet
in
misfortune
to
these
plain
white
people
i
must
have
dropped
and
then
roxy
and
virgie
sold
to
some
temporary
rich
man
would
have
been
above
me
slaves
as
they
would
continue
how
false
how
fatal
both
slavery
and
proud
riches
to
the
republicans
we
pretend
to
be
compelled
at
last
i
shall
not
close
my
eyes
nor
harden
my
heart
the
maid
from
newark
had
meantime
quietly
inspected
the
rag
carpet
the
cloth
hangings
the
fairy
rocker
and
all
the
acquisitions
of
her
uncle
abode
and
vesta
again
observed
that
she
was
of
slender
and
willowy
shape
and
motion
unaffected
in
anything
not
forward
nor
excited
and
with
the
shrewd
look
so
near
ready
wit
that
she
could
make
vesta
laugh
almost
at
will
vesta
showed
her
how
to
administer
cool
drink
and
the
sponging
to
the
sufferer
and
he
saw
them
together
with
a
look
of
inquiry
which
the
febrile
action
soon
drove
away
are
your
parents
living
rhoda

milburn
opened
his
eyes
and
sighed
and
saw
them
together
and
rhoda
held
back
considerately
while
the
young
wife
approached
the
bed
he
looked
at
her
with
a
bewildered
doubt
i
thought
they
said
you

gone
forever
he
murmured
no

or
until

high
principle
though

cried
rhoda
with
a
quick
divination
of
something
unsettled
or
misunderstood

afraid
of
you
till

he
tried
to
smile
though
the
strong
sweat
succeeding
the
fever
broke
upon
him
from
his
hands
to
his
face
she
is
yours
he
said
the
best
of
my
poor
kin
do

despise
us
vesta
drew
her
arm
around
rhoda
and
kissed
her
that
he
might
see
it
what
goodness
he
sighed
and
the
opening
of
his
pores
as
it
let
the
fever
escape
gave
him
a
feeling
of
drowsy
relief
which
vesta
understood
now
let
us
turn
the
covers
under
the
edges
rhoda
she
said
and
put
your
over
him

pleasing
dimples

him

exclaimed
the
judge
that

continued
rhoda
earnestly
with
a
slight
sniffle
of
a
nose
and
a
dimpling
that
argued
to
vesta
something
to
come
misc
somers
says
you
held
one
of
them
babies
jedge
to
let
its
mother
shout
and

that

the
other
mother
lord
sakes
misc
somers

said
the
judge
finding
the
laugh
against
him
i
never
did
better
electioneering
than
that
day
by
holding
that
baby
five
minutes
i
made
a
vote
and
the
mother
will
hold

twenty
years
before

will
make

misc
somers
says

but
i
told
her
you

sech
conviction
you

one
from
the
other
she
says
sly
and
safe
when
he
gits
over
yer
on
the
worcester
side
misc
somers
she
dreadful
plain
william
tilghman
during
the
continuation
of
this
colloquy
looked
with
interest
on
the
two
young
ladies
vesta
the
elder
by
two
or
three
years
and
richly
endowed
with
the
lights
of
both
beauty
and
accomplishments
the
maid
from
the
ocean
side
plainer
and
with
no
ornament
within
or
without
but
he
could
foresee
under
fostering
a
graceful
woman
with
coquetry
and
fascination
not
wholly
latent
there
and
as
his
eyes
met
rhoda
he
interpreted
the
look
that
at
a
certain
time
of
life
almost
every
maiden
casts
on
meeting
a
young
man
is
he
single
she
shot
this
look
so
archly
yet
so
strong
that
the
arrow
wounded
him
a
very
little
as
it
glanced
off
he
smiled
but
the
consciousness
was
restored
a
moment
that
he
was
a
young
man
still
as
well
as
a
priest
love
which
had
closed
a
door
like
the
portal
of
a
tomb
against
him
began
to
come
forth
like
a
and
wink
its
lamp
athwart
the
dark
she
must
come
to
he
thought
if
she
stays
in
princess
anne
we
will
polish
her
the
not
being
satisfied
with
any
lull
in
the
conversation
pearted
up
as
he
saw
vesta
withdraw
and
cried
meee
shack
see
me
see
me
gents
gents
gents
genten
sweet
sweetie
sweetie
hoo
hoo
see
see
vesty
she
ha
ha
he
flew
in
the
air
over
his
stirring
master
as
if
doubting
that
all
was
well
since
the
strange
lady
who
had
been
so
quiet
all
the
morning
was
gone
that
bird
almost
speaks
said
william
tilghman
i
have
spent
many
an
hour
teaching
them
but
never
could
make
one
talk
like
that
maybe
you
had
too
much
to
teach
to
it
rhoda
holland
said
it
often
they
can
speak
and
they
must
have
much
company
to
learn
well
uncle
meshach
haint
had
no
company
but
that
bird
for
years
i
reckon
the
bird
got
mad
and
lonesome
and
jest
hooted
words
at
him
what
is
it
saying
now
tilghman
asked
see
it
is
almost
convulsive
in
its
attempts
to
say
something
the
gray
bird
as
impressive
as
a
poor
poet
seemed
nearly
in
a
state
of
epilepsy
to
bring
up
some
burden
of
oppressive
sound
and
as
they
watched
it
almost
tipsy
with
the
intoxicant
of
speech
fluttering
driving
and
striking
in
the
air
it
suddenly
brought
out
a
note
liquid
as
gurgling
snow
from
a
spout
love
love
ha
ha
well
done
old
bachelor
judge
custis
remarked
in
spite
of
his
fagged
face
for
good
resolution
and
yesterday
unbracing
had
left
him
somewhat
limp
and
haggard
still
he
brings
out
as
if
he
had
made
a
vow
against
it
but
the
confession
had
to
come
many
a
monk
would
sing
the
same
if
instinct
could
find
a
daring
word
in
his
chorals
these
mockers
of
maryland
were
celebrated
in
the
british
magazines
a
hundred
years
ago
and
i
recall
some
lines
about
them
he
then
recited
breast
whose
plumes
a
cheerful
white
display
his
quivering
wings
are
dressed
in
sober
gray
sure
all
the
muses
this
their
bird
inspire
and
he
alone
is
equal
to
a
choir
oh
sweet
musician
thou
dost
far
excel
the
soothing
song
of
pleasing
philomel
sweet
is
her
song
but
in
few
notes
confined
but
thine
thou
mimic
of
the
feathery
kind
runs
thro
all
notes
thou
only
them
all
at
once
the
copy
and
th
original
that
magnificins
rhoda
exclaimed
with
quiet
delight
who
is
mil
jedge
oh
that
the
british
nightingale
these
american
surpass
them
as
one
of
our
eastern
shore
clippers
outsails
all
the
naval
powers
of
europe
i
hearn
british
nightingale
rhoda
said
with
a
flash
of
her
eyes
he
was
a
blind
man
with
green
specticklers
that
sang
at
sweet
that
the
way
he
plonounced
it
an
it
affected
of
him
so
he
had
to
drink
a
whole
tumbler
of
water
an
misc
somers
spying
around
to
see
if
he
was
the
rale
nightingale
she
found
it
was
gin
in
that
glass
and
told
about
it
rhoda
made
even
the
minister
laugh
as
she
indented
her
cheeks
and
cast
a
sheep
glance
at
him
and
the
judge
he
marvelled
that
such
forest
english
could
be
resented
so
little
by
his
mind
but
he
thought
never
mind
she
may
have
had
no
more
lessons
than
the
bird
whose
difficulty
is
even
beautiful
but
see
milburn
is
wide
awake
my
friend
how
do
you
feel
better
better
murmured
milburn
i
can
not
lie
here
any
more
there
is
money
gentlemen
dependent
on
my
getting
about
he
started
up
with
the
greatest
resolution
and
confidence
and
fell
upon
his
head
before
he
had
left
the
coverlets
no
no
said
the
judge
as
he
and
tilghman
picked
milburn
up
and
arranged
him
as
before
your
will
is
matched
this
time
my
brave
you
are
back
in
the
hut
you
have
consumed
among
the
fires
thereof
and
the
avenging
blast
of
nassawongo
furnace
burns
in
your
veins
and
cools
you
in
the
alternately
lie
there
and
repent
for
the
injury
you
have
done
a
spotless
one
if
meshach
heard
this
it
was
never
known
but
the
unconscious
or
impulsive
utterance
strengthened
the
impression
with
tilghman
and
rhoda
that
vesta
marriage
was
not
altogether
voluntary
and
produced
on
both
a
feeling
of
deeper
sympathy
and
respect
for
her
judge
the
young
minister
said
do
good
for
evil
if
evil
there
has
been
i
have
given
him
my
hand
sincerely
perhaps
you
can
relieve
his
mind
of
some
business
care
milburn
the
judge
said
when
he
saw
the
resinous
eyes
roll
towards
him
again
out
of
that
swarthy
face
now
pale
with
weakness
i
am
out
of
a
job
now
and
can
work
cheap
let
me
do
any
errand
for
you
a
look
of
petulance
followed
by
one
of
inquiry
came
up
from
eyes
and
he
pressed
his
head
between
his
wrists
as
if
to
bring
back
the
blood
that
might
propel
his
judgment
they
heard
him
mutter
no
business
prudence
yet
plausible
persuasive
might
do
it
well
the
judge
spoke
now
with
some
firmness
milburn
there
is
no
use
of
your
rebelling
here
you
are
and
here
you
will
lie
till
nature
does
her
restoration
assisted
by
this
medicine
i
have
brought
you
you
must
undergo
calomel
and
this
quinine
must
set
on
its
work
of
several
weeks
to
break
up
the
regularity
of
these
chills
in
the
meantime
as
your
interests
are
also
vesta
and
vesta
are
mine
let
me
serve
her
if
not
you
the
positive
tone
influenced
the
weakened
system
of
the
patient
he
looked
at
all
three
of
the
observers
and
said
to
tilghman
william
i
might
send
you
but
for
your
calling
leave
me
with
the
judge
a
little
while
both
you
and
rhoda
rhoda
took
the
conestoga
bonnet
from
the
top
of
the
entailed
hat
box
and
arrayed
herself
in
it
to
the
rector
exceeding
wonder
let
you
and
me
go
take
a
little
walk
she
said
putting
her
hand
in
his
arm
with
a
quiet
confidence
in
which
was
a
spark
of
meshach
will
i
ai
afraid
of
princess
anne
people
if
they
are
proud
mise
somers
says
king
solomons
was
no
better
than
a
lily
outen
the
pond
and
said
so
himself
the
young
man
sincere
as
his
humility
was
blushed
a
little
at
the
idea
of
walking
through
his
native
town
with
that
bonnet
at
his
side
he
being
of
one
of
the
families
of
the
old
peninsula
his
the
of
washington
and
messenger
from
yorktown
to
congress
with
the
news
cornwallis
has
fallen
but
it
was
his
chivalric
sense
and
not
his
piety
which
immediately
dispelled
the
last
touch
of
coxcombry
when
he
felt
that
a
lady
had
requested
him
with
happiness
miss
holland
and
he
did
not
feel
one
shrinking
thought
again
as
he
ran
the
gantlet
of
the
idle
fellows
of
the
town
many
of
them
his
former
vagrant
playmates
rhoda
was
perfectly
happy
he
would
have
taken
her
to
his
grandmother
with
whom
he
kept
house
but
that
aristocratic
old
dowager
might
say
something
he
considered
to
destroy
rhoda
confidence
in
her
elegant
appearance
and
easy
vocabulary
and
they
walked
past
teackle
hall
where
vesta
saw
them
and
opened
the
door
and
made
them
come
in
and
eat
a
little
rhoda
at
first
showed
some
uneasiness
under
this
great
pile
of
habitation
but
vesta
was
so
natural
and
gracious
that
the
shyness
wore
off
and
at
a
fitting
moment
the
bride
said
rhoda
my
dear
there
is
a
bonnet
i
expect
to
wear
this
winter
and
i
want
to
try
it
on
you
whom
i
think
it
will
particularly
become
rhoda
quiet
eyes
flashed
as
she
saw
the
new
article
and
heard
vesta
praise
it
upon
her
head
the
old
bonnet
had
received
a
cruel
blow
in
spite
of
somers
tilghman
too
accused
himself
that
he
felt
a
little
relieved
when
he
escorted
rhoda
back
to
meshach
in
another
bonnet
and
vesta
followed
with
her
great
shaggy
dog
turk
she
not
unconscious
though
serene
and
thoughtfully
polite
to
all
she
knew
of
people
peering
at
her
in
wonder
and
excitement
from
every
door
and
window
of
the
town
the
news
was
working
in
every
household
from
the
servants
in
the
kitchens
to
the
aged
people
helped
to
their
food
with
bib
and
spoon
that
the
famed
daughter
of
daniel
custis
was
the
prize
of
the
junk
dealer
and
usurer
in
old
town
by
the
bridge
who
had
enslaved
a
wife
at
last
chapter
xix
the
dusky
levels
the
new
left
alone
with
judge
custis
asked
to
be
propped
up
in
bed
and
nothing
was
visible
that
would
support
his
pillow
but
the
aged
leather
that
custis
with
a
wry
face
brought
to
do
duty
my
illness
is
unfortunate
he
gasped
not
only
to
me
but
to
the
new
ties
i
have
formed
to
the
mutual
interest
my
wife
and
i
have
in
making
up
your
losses
on
nassawongo
furnace
which
we
are
all
the
poorer
by
to
that
amount
and
to
a
suitor
whose
cause
i
have
taken
up
i
have
bought
an
interest
in
a
great
lawsuit
then
the
day
of
reckoning
of
your
enemies
has
come
milburn
not
yet
said
the
sick
man
with
a
proud
flash
of
his
eyes
unless
i
am
no
merchant
and
you
are
no
lawyer
and
the
first
i
will
not
concede
nor
i
the
second
exclaimed
the
judge
with
some
pride
and
temper
you
were
once
a
good
lawyer
if
visionary
resumed
the
with
scant
ceremony
had
we
been
able
to
respect
each
other
we
might
have
been
confederated
in
things
valuable
to
ourselves
and
to
our
time
and
place
but
that
is
past
and
you
do
not
possess
my
confidence
as
my
legal
agent
my
attorney
i
wish
you
to
get
another
advocate
for
me
i
am
willing
to
be
useful
even
without
your
compliments
the
judge
said
remembering
his
christian
resolution
we
will
not
quarrel
if
i
can
serve
you
i
do
not
wish
to
hurt
your
feelings
but
my
strength
is
not
great
enough
for
unmeaning
flattery
this
marriage
was
so
dear
to
my
heart
that
i
have
put
it
before
a
very
large
interest
about
which
i
have
no
time
to
lose
and
still
am
helpless
upon
this
bed
i
will
trust
you
to
do
my
errand
go
to
that
chest
judge
custis
and
you
will
find
a
package
of
papers
in
the
cedar
till
at
the
end
bring
them
here
as
the
judge
opened
the
old
chest
a
musty
smell
as
of
mummies
wrapped
in
herbs
ascended
into
his
nose
and
he
saw
some
faded
clothes
as
those
of
poor
people
deceased
male
and
female
lying
within
the
piped
a
noisy
warning
as
he
raised
the
lid
of
the
till
and
saw
the
desired
papers
among
a
parcel
of
spotted
and
striped
come
see
come
see
meshach
he
he
sweet
now
open
the
window
yonder
said
meshach
taking
the
papers
and
let
tom
fly
out
he
starts
my
nerves
tom
the
spreading
its
wings
and
tail
and
striking
obstinately
towards
its
master
a
minute
as
he
whistled
flew
out
of
the
window
and
settled
in
the
old
willow
below
and
had
a
concert
calling
the
passing
dogs
by
name
whistling
to
them
and
deceiving
cats
and
chickens
with
invitations
they
familiarly
heard
to
eat
to
shoo
to
scat
and
to
roost
if
he
regulates
his
wife
like
that
bird
the
judge
spoke
to
himself
she
will
fly
to
heaven
soon
milburn
opened
the
papers
counted
them
and
handed
them
to
his
the
papers
will
be
plain
to
you
judge
custis
after
i
have
made
a
few
words
of
explanation
you
well
know
that
the
canal
between
the
delaware
and
chesapeake
is
finished
and
vessels
are
now
passing
through
it
from
bay
to
bay
it
is
taking
one
hundred
dollars
a
day
tolls
and
twenty
vessels
already
go
past
between
sun
and
sun
though
the
size
of
the
shipping
of
the
cities
it
connects
has
not
yet
been
adapted
to
its
proportions
it
has
been
a
cheap
and
quick
work
costing
something
above
two
millions
of
dollars
taking
only
five
years
of
time
and
yet
it
has
begun
its
mercantile
life
by
a
cheat
upon
a
man
to
whom
it
is
indebted
as
a
promoter
and
contractor
and
to
whom
i
have
advanced
the
means
to
compel
justice
and
damages
well
well
milburn
i
must
pay
tribute
to
your
enterprise
the
era
of
these
great
carrying
corporations
has
barely
begun
and
you
stake
your
little
fortune
against
one
of
them
that
is
backed
by
the
great
city
of
philadelphia
the
canal
passes
through
the
state
of
delaware
in
which
is
three
quarters
of
its
little
length
of
only
fourteen
miles
and
there
a
suit
will
be
free
to
some
extent
from
the
corruptions
they
might
exercise
in
pennsylvania
and
if
successful
there
we
can
more
easily
attach
the
tolls
of
the
canal
i
have
no
more
faith
in
the
legislature
of
delaware
than
of
any
other
state
kidnappers
sit
in
its
responsible
seats
and
it
licenses
lotteries
to
make
prizes
of
its
own
honor
but
we
shall
try
our
case
before
a
simple
jury
which
will
be
flax
in
the
hands
of
one
lawyer
in
that
state
if
we
can
secure
him
but
hitherto
he
has
refused
my
contractor
and
will
not
take
the
case
why
said
the
judge
you
must
mean
clayton
the
new
senator
that
is
the
man
milburn
continued
stopping
for
strength
and
breath
he
is
finely
educated
i
hear
at
the
colleges
and
law
schools
and
possesses
a
remarkable
power
over
the
agricultural
and
mixed
races
of
that
small
state
whom
he
thoroughly
understands
by
sympathy
and
acquaintance
i
heard
him
once
in
court
at
georgetown
wither
and
confound
the
confederated
kidnapping
influences
of
the
whole
peninsula
and
against
the
will
and
intention
of
the
jury
prevail
upon
their
fears
and
sensibilities
to
find
a
bold
rogue
guilty
of
stealing
free
men
of
color
a
rogue
who
was
in
this
room
unless
it
is
a
delusion
of
my
fever
this
very
day
and
with
whom
i
fancied
i
had
been
in
collision
somewhere
you
only
knocked
him
down
with
a
brick
after
samson
had
done
it
with
his
fist
and
then
the
fellow
came
to
me
for
shelter
afraid
you
would
pursue
him
at
law
and
i
suppose
he
did
an
errand
for
my
servants
to
this
abode
the
judge
looked
around
upon
the
abode
as
if
he
had
used
the
most
respectable
word
he
could
possibly
apply
to
it
i
will
compromise
with
such
scoundrels
as
that
one
milburn
spoke
only
when
i
am
afraid
of
them
but
to
conclude
my
statement
for
reasons
of
timidity
or
doubts
of
success
or
political
ambition
something
i
can
not
fathom
clayton
will
not
hearken
to
my
debtor
and
i
have
not
disclosed
my
own
interest
in
the
suit
he
is
at
home
from
washington
and
an
appointment
has
been
made
with
him
at
his
office
in
dover
you
see
i
am
unable
to
keep
it
and
i
have
no
one
else
to
send
and
information
reaches
me
that
the
canal
company
discovering
my
money
in
the
contractor
bank
account
intends
to
retain
clayton
forthwith
if
you
set
out
this
afternoon
you
can
reach
laureltown
for
bedtime
it
is
at
least
forty
miles
thence
to
dover
and
you
might
ride
it
by
noon
with
push
and
in
that
case
you
have
a
chance
to
beat
the
philadelphia
emissary
several
hours
i
have
five
thousand
dollars
at
stake
already
i
believe
i
shall
get
damages
of
forty
times
five
if
i
can
retain
that
man
i
am
ready
to
start
at
once
said
the
judge
rising
up
i
can
read
these
papers
on
the
way
the
saddle
was
my
cradle
and
i
have
a
good
horse
my
valise
can
follow
me
on
the
stage
unless
you
see
the
best
reasons
for
it
my
name
is
not
to
be
mentioned
to
any
one
as
a
party
to
this
suit
i
am
not
popular
with
juries
then
milburn
said
the
judge
but
did
not
extend
his
hand
as
you
treat
my
daughter
may
god
treat
you
amen
exclaimed
the
as
the
judge
feet
passed
over
the
below
and
he
sank
back
to
the
bed
exhausted
again
while
the
proceedings
described
occupied
the
white
people
the
servants
roxy
and
virgie
in
their
clean
sunday
suits
loitered
around
the
bridge
behind
the
store
or
strayed
a
little
way
up
the
manokin
brook
hearing
the
rend
his
breast
in
all
the
ventriloquy
of
genius
virgie

it
made
everybody
oncomfitable
i

about
meshach
belling
a
buzzard
said
roxy
but
they
say
he
got
something
on
his
foot
too
like
a
hoof
a
clove
foot
did
you
ever
see

samson
he
never
tuk
his

said
the
negro
warily
to
let

see
it
dat
bell
on

gals
is
like
white
beauty
in
a
colored
skin
it
draws
white
men
and
black
men
like
quare
music
in
de
air
but
it
makes
de
pale
gal
lonesome
she
ca
marry
ary
white
man
she
despises
black
ones
the
shrewd
lover
had
touched
a
chord
of
young
pain
in
the
hearts
of
both
those
delicate
quadroons
both
were
so
nearly
white
that
the
slight
corruption
increased
their
beauty
rounded
their
graceful
limbs
plumpened
their
willowy
figures
gave
a
softness
like
mild
night
to
their
expressive
eyes
and
blackened
the
silken
tassels
of
their
elegant
long
hair
no
tutor
had
taught
them
how
to
walk
they
who
moved
on
health
like
skylarks
on
the
air
faithful
modest
natural
they
were
still
slaves
and
their
place
in
matrimony
which
nature
would
have
set
among
the
worthiest
superior
in
love
superior
in
maternity
superior
in
length
of
days
and
enjoyment
was
by
the
freak
of
man
as
doubtful
as
the
mermaid
roxy
was
a
little
the
shorter
and
fuller
of
shape
the
milder
and
more
pathetic
in
virgie
the
white
race
had
left
its
leaner
lines
and
greater
unrelenting
she
said
to
samson
with
the
pique
her
reflections
inspired
i
never
thought
the
first
man
to
make
love
to
me
would
be
as
black
as

roxy
cried
see
how
she
and
coloring
about

virgie
throat
was
sending
up
its
tremors
to
her
eyes
and
a
wild
speculative
something
throbbed
in
her
slender
wrists
and
beat
in
the
little
jacket
that
was
moulded
to
her
swelling
form
the
first
sight
of
freedom
in
the

doe
freedom

my

roxy
added

dream
dis

is
too
purty
he
said
to
be
worn
by
a
slave
let
me
make
it
free
she
turned
away
but
the
negro
had
been
a
wise
lover
and
his
plea
pierced
home
and
it
struck
the
caucasian
fatherhood
of
the
bright
quadroon
freedom
is
mos
all
i
got
the
negro
continued
it
wuth
everything
but

well
out

riding
to

when
the
little
assembled
without
his
patronage
over
the
old
store
and
the
young
minister
directed
it
in
the
warm
afternoon
the
windows
were
raised
till
milburn
chill
began
to
set
in
again
and
they
could
hear
the
in

tantalizing
the

whistling
to
him

would
run

run
back

nobody
watch
all
the
windows
of
the
store
and
finally
he
seemed
to
think
the
spot
was
haunted
or
unreliable
in
some
way
for
he
would
next
run
to
the
open
store
door
and
bark
run
back
and
from
a
distance
watch
the
hollow
dark
within
as
if
a
vague
enemy
lived
there
mocking
his
obedient
nature
and
keeping
his
mistress
captive
turk
was
a
setter
with
mastiff
mixing
worth
a
little
for
the
hunt
and
more
for
the
watch
but
as
an
ornament
and
friend
worth
more
than
all
he
was
so
impartial
in
his
favors
as
to
like

the

we
need
often
to
kedge
home
to

bars
of
life
and
hope
in
ever
so
little
an
anchor
helps
a
little
if
we
do
not
lose
the
line
little
hopes
are
often
better
than
great
ones
for
hopes
swamp
little
vessels
even
hope
must
be
artfully
shaped
and
skilfully
dropped
to
take
hold
of
the
unseen
bottoms
of
opportunity
all
of
us
have
entertained
burdensome
hopes
heavy
anchors
and
they
would
not
hold
us
against
the
breakers
but
there
may
be
little
hopes
carried
in
advance
of
us
that
will
draw
us
into
pleasant
sounds
and
bays
we
owe
to
you
rhoda
this
comforting
hope

you

thou

enter
this
sinking
church
of
thine
and
dwell
in

heart
the
sounds
of
her
singing
reached
the
people
rambling
curiously
around
on
sunday
afternoon
to
see
the
principals
in
the
surprising
marriage
they
had
but
lately
heard
of
and
as
she
ended
milburn
called
her
saying
it
is
time
for
you
to
leave
me
till
is
that
your
desire
it
is
kind
lady
i
have
a
samson
used
to
all
my
work
and
you
can
hear
of
my
condition
through
your
slave
girls
going
and
coming
i
want
you
to
feel
free
as
ever
though
my
wife
at
last
i
did
not
seek
you
to
cloud
your
morning
but
to
share
your
sunshine
go
to
teackle
hall
and
there
i
will
come
when
i
am
stronger
at
no
time
do
i
ever
wish
you
to
sleep
in
this
old
stable
may
i
come
and
sit
with
you
sir
oh
do
so
i
must
see
you
a
little
day
by
day
may
i
take
rhoda
with
me
yes
if
you
will
do
it
she
is
a
poor
girl
but
that
is
not
her
fault
vesta
bent
and
touched
his
forehead
with
her
lips
and
as
she
drew
back
he
raised
his
cold
hand
and
put
a
piece
of
paper
in
hers
present
my
love
to
your
mother
he
said
in
a
chill
and
return
her
the
losses
judge
custis
has
named
to
me
as
her
portion
in
nassawongo
furnace
the
amount
is
in
this
check
which
i
give
you
although
it
is
sunday
because
it
represents
no
business
among
any
of
us
but
an
act
of
peace
you
are
an
honorable
man
vesta
said
i
have
cost
you
dearly
it
is
the
bumping
of
a
few
years
on
the
bar
meshach
answered
trying
to
smile
be
you
my
anchor
out
in
calm
water
and
i
will
try
to
draw
to
you
some
day
it
is
not
the
price
i
pay
that
troubles
me
it
is
the
price
you
are
paying
i
am
deeply
interested
in
you
vesta
said
if
i
should
say
more
than
that
it
would
not
now
be
true
thank
you
for
that
much
milburn
said
even
your
pity
is
a
treasure
and
i
thank
god
that
i
have
made
so
much
progress
before
you
go
let
my
bird
come
in
and
then
shut
the
window
to
keep
the
and
owls
from
finding
him
he
managed
between
his
rising
paroxysms
of
the
chill
to
whistle
a
note
or
two
and
tom
flew
in
the
window
and
fluttered
viciously
around
his
head
as
if
to
be
revenged
for
exile
and
then
leaping
on
the
old
set
up
a
show
performance
in
which
were
all
the
menagerie
of
town
and
field
and
stopping
a
little
while
to
hear
the
bird
sing
her
name
again
vesta
and
her
friends
withdrew
custis
was
found
in
her
bedroom
much
improved
in
spirits
but
highly
nervous
oh
my
poor
martyred
murdered
idol
she
screamed
as
vesta
came
in
are
you
alive
is
the
beast
dead
do
tell
me
he
dares
to
live
yes
mamma
here
are
his
teeth
vesta
said
when
she
had
kissed
her
mother
warmly
he
has
sent
you
a
check
for
all
your
lost
money
and
his
love
and
me
to
live
here
with
you
in
teackle
hall
liberty
restitution
as
you
name
it
and
his
affection
to
both
of
us
is
he
not
a
gentleman
now
custis
eagerly
took
the
check
do
you
believe
it
is
good
precious
maybe
he
sent
it
to
deceive
me
while
he
could
take
advantage
of
your
gratitude
oh
these
foresters
are
devils
i
wish
i
had
the
money
for
it
it
is
good
for
everything
he
has
mamma
not
to
pay
it
would
make
him
a
bankrupt
he
gave
it
to
me
almost
with
gallantry
indeed
he
is
the
most
singular
man
i
ever
knew
that
is
the
case
with
all
pirates
said
custis
something
in
the
female
nature
attracts
us
to
lawless
men
who
take
what
they
want
ourselves
included
we
were
i
suppose
originally
just
seized
and
appropriated
and
are
looking
out
for
the
appropriator
to
this
day
but
you
vesta
with
the
baltimore
blood
in
you
do
not
expect
to
play
the
sabine
bride
tamely
like
that
to
defend
your
spoiler
and
reconcile
him
to
your
brethren
i
was
thinking
it
was
the
baltimore
blood
that
made
me
appreciate
milburn
mamma
the
custises
were
not
traders
pshaw
the
custises
were
libertines
unless
history
belies
them
they
had
else
no
popularity
in
the
scamp
court
of
he
thought
the
daughter
of
any
gentleman
in
his
following
was
made
for
his
mistress
and
a
large
percentage
of
the
said
damsels
thought
he
was
right
milburn
is
no
cavalier
i
can
see
that
vesta
said
i
am
attracted
to
him
by
elements
of
such
strength
and
simplicity
that
i
fancy
he
is
a
puritan
puritan
fiddlestick
custis
said
putting
milburn
check
in
her
bosom
and
pinning
it
in
there
and
looking
vigilantly
at
the
pin
afterwards
now
my
great
comfort
my
only
mclane
do
not
idealize
this
forester
as
of
any
beginning
whatsoever
it
is
all
wrong
thousands
of
convicts
were
exported
to
chesapeake
bay
from
the
slums
of
london
bristol

propagated
here
like
the
pokeweed
with
instincts
of
larceny
and
possibly
a
little
rebellion
in
it
your
man
has
robbed
this
house
of
your
person
if
he
should
also
take
your
heart
the
shame

be
upon
us
oh
mother
you
are
unforgiving
of
course
i
am
i
am
scotch
you
have
not
one
but
this
who
would
give
you
back
the
large
amount
your
husband
has
misspent
not
one
who
could
do
it
but
at
a
sacrifice
you
would
not
permit
for
you
and
papa
to
restore
your
faith
in
each
other
i
married
our
stranger
creditor
forcing
him
to
the
altar
rather
than
he
me
and
he
has
already
proved
himself
of
more
delicacy
than
you
if
i
am
to
believe
you
are
in
your
right
mind
no
i
am
no
mclane
you
are
not
if
you
do
not
use
their
perseverance
to
get
the
better
of
meshach

you
have
obtained
a
marriage
settlement
with
him
now
have
it
confirmed
and
sue
out
your
divorce
before
the
legislature
publicly
as
you
have
been
profaned
ask
the
state
of
maryland
for
reparation
the

the
custises
and
all
their
connections
from
the
christine
river
to

make
your
cause
if
necessary
a
political

and
the
courts
of
this
county
will
give
you
damages
out
of
this
unpopular
wealth
vesta
looked
at
her
mother
with
astonishment
what
would
become
of
my
my
maiden
name
if
i
made
that
show
of
my
private
griefs
mother
why
you
would
be
a
heroine
every
old
lover
of
whom
there
are
so
many
eligible
ones
would
feel
his
zeal
return
a
romance
would
attend
your
name
wherever
the
baltimore
newspapers
are
taken
and
you
would
be
as
great
a
heroine
as
betty
patterson
that
disobedient
girl
vesta
still
in
astonishment
exclaimed
i
saw
her
when
the
bride
of
jerome
bonaparte
she
was
not
half
as
lovely
as
you
if
jerome
had
seen
you
you
were
not
born
then
and
i
was
in
society
he
would
never
have
looked
at
betty
but
you
see
she
forced
a
settlement
out
of
the
emperor
husbanded
the
income
of
it
and
she
is
rich
and
freer
than
if
she
had
become
a
french
bonaparte
weak
as
they
may
be
in
many
things
i
am
a
custis
vesta
spoke
with
pale
scorn
i
would
not
drag
my
name
through
the
lobbies
of
annapolis
to
wear
the
crown
of
josephine
the
word
i
gave
in
pity
of
my
parents
to
the
man
who
is
now
my
husband
to
become
his
wife
i
would
not
take
back
to
my
dying
day
unless
he
first
denied
his
word
i
believe
there
is
such
a
thing
as
honor
yet
mother
you
fret
my
father
by
such
principles
they
are
the
principles
of
your
uncle
allan
mclane
a
man
i
shrink
from
vesta
said
although
he
is
your
brother
his
unfeeling
respectability
his
unchangeableness
his
want
of
every
impulse
but
hate
his
appropriation
of
our
family
honor
as
if
he
was
our
lawgiver
and
his
secretiveness
formal
religion
and
mysterious
prosperity
i
do
not
appreciate
much
as
i
have
tried
to
be
charitable
to
him
i
do
not
like
baltimore
as
i
do
the
eastern
shore
it
is
fierce
hard
and
suspicious
you
shall
not
run
down
baltimore
before
me
custis
cried
hotly
it
is
a
paradise
to
this
region
and
comparing
meshach
milburn
to
your
uncle
is
blasphemy
i
have
on
my
finger
mother
his
mother
ring
a
pretty
object
it
is
said
custis
taking
a
peep
at
it
and
another
at
her
check
it
requires
a
microscope
to
find
it
the
next
thing
you
will
be
walking
through
baltimore
on
your
bridal
tour
followed
by
a
mob
of
small
boys
to
see
meshach
old
hat
then
i
shall
feel
for
you
vesta
the
cruel
blow
struck
home
vesta
reception
so
unexpected
so
acrimonious
affected
her
with
a
sense
of
gross
ingratitude
and
with
a
greater
disappointment
she
had
failed
to
restore
joy
to
her
parents
by
her
desperate
sacrifice
she
began
to
feel
that
she
might
have
done
wrong
the
broad
sight
of
her
act
looking
back
upon
it
from
this
momentary
revulsion
seemed
a
frightful
flood
like
the
mouth
of
one
of
the
little
eastern
shore
rivers
that
expands
to
a
gulf
in
the
progress
of
a
brook
last
night
she
saw
in
an
instant
the
misunderstandings
and
ruin
she
could
prevent
by
her
ready
decision
now
she
saw
the
misunderstandings
she
never
could
correct
the
prejudices
stronger
than
parental
sympathy
the
wide
separation
her
marriage
had
effected
between
two
classes
of
her
duty
to
think
with
her
husband
affection
and
her
mother
interests
at
the
same
time
it
also
occurred
to
her
that
her
father
the
darling
of
her
thought
had
seemed
slow
to
appreciate
her
marriage
sacrifice
and
was
testy
at
her
willingness
to
loosen
her
heart
with
her
vestal
zone
towards
her
husband
the
whole
day
had
passed
with
such
relief
such
satisfaction
that
she
expected
to
end
it
in
the
tranquillity
of
teackle
hall
like
some
young
eagle
returned
to
her
nest
with
abundant
prey
for
the
old
birds
there
worn
out
with
storm
and
time
in
place
of
love
and
healing
nature
vesta
had
found
worldliness
resentment
intrigue
and
aspersion
concluding
with
a
reference
to
the
one
object
she
feared
and
shrank
from
the
hat
of
dark
entail
the
shadow
upon
her
future
life
her
eyes
filled
up
she
lisped
aloud
i
wish
i
had
stayed
with
my
husband
has
he
become
so
necessary
to
you
already
asked
custis
he
does
appreciate
my
sacrifice
vesta
said
and
her
low
sobs
filled
the
room
in
a
moment
virgie
entered
alert
to
her
playmate
pains
and
threw
her
arms
around
her
mistress
and
kissed
her
like
a
child
oh
missy
she
spoke
to
custis
to
make
her
cry
after
what
she
has
done
for
all
of
us
to
save
your
home
to
save
me
from
being
sold
no
scruples
of
race
made
vesta
reject
this
sympathy
precious
to
her
parched
breast
despite
the
quadroon
taint
as
the
golden
sand
in
the
brooks
of
africa
giving
at
once
wealth
and
cooling
the
slave
long
white
arms
scarcely
less
pale
than
ivory
for
she
had
slipped
in
at
the
sign
of
sorrow
while
making
her
simple
toilet
drew
vesta
into
her
lap
and
laid
her
head
upon
the
fair
maiden
shoulder
as
if
it
was
a
babe
on
such
a
shoulder
only
a
shadow
darker
vesta
had
often
lain
in
infancy
and
sucked
the
milk
that
was
sweet
as
eve
the
common
fount
of
white
and
black
at
the
breast
of
virgie
mother
that
faithful
nurse
was
gone
the
wild
grew
upon
her
grave
but
virgie
inherited
the
motherly
instinct
and
added
the
sisterly
sympathy
and
her
rich
hair
half
unbound
streamed
down
on
vesta
temples
among
the
dark
ringlets
there
while
she
looked
into
her
own
spirit
for
a
word
to
check
those
tears
and
found
it
people
will
say
you
have
been
crying
dear
missy
the
lord
knows
you
did
right
do
let
anybody
make
you
lose
your
faith
till
your
master
your
husband
does
wrong
to
you
he
would
like
to
have
you
cry
there
was
a
nervous
chord
somewhere
in
the
slave
throat
that
trembled
on
the
key
of
the
heroic
and
her
nostrils
slightly
rounded
her
head
free
of
carriage
as
the
wild
colt
and
a
light
from
her
soft
eyes
that
seemed
to
be
reflected
on
their
long
silken
lashes
bore
out
a
spirit
tamed
by
servitude
which
still
could
kindle
to
everything
that
concerned
woman
in
her
birthright
vesta
kissed
virgie
and
ceased
to
sob
she
rose
and
kissed
her
mother
also
it
was
very
wrong
in
me
to
say
what
i
did
not
wish
to
say
about
uncle
allan
mamma
i
hope
papa
was
kind
to
you
dear
me
custis
cried
everything
is
turned
upside
down
by
that
bog
iron
a
new
element
has
come
into
the
family
to
disturb
it
nobody
believes
anything
respectable
any
more
your
father
is
an
infidel
or
a
radical
or
something
perverse
you
are
defending
those
wild
foresters
what
will
become
of
the
christian
religion
and
society
and
good
principles
what
did
papa
say
before
he
left
home
he
acted
in
the
strangest
manner
vesta
he
came
right
in
and
kissed
me
like
a
great
booby
and
sat
down
and
wanted
to
talk
about
our
courting
days
i
thought
at
first
he
was
drunk
again
or
that
the
methodists
had
got
hold
of
him
and
fed
him
on
straw
how
do
you
account
for
it
virgie
had
slipped
out
as
soon
as
the
talk
became
confidential
he
wants
to
do
better
dear
mamma
do
respond
to
his
contrition
and
affection
if
we
could
all
humble
our
hearts
it
would
be
so
easy
to
start
life
better
and
turn
this
accident
to
joy
and
comfort
i
have
found
new
engagements
and
reliefs
already
there
is
a
young
girl
milburn
niece
whom
i
shall
bring
home
this
evening
and
occupy
myself
teaching
her
she
is
an
orphan
without
a
mother
knowledge
barely
able
to
read
but
pretty
and
quaint
bring
a
forester
in
here
custis
exclaimed
fairly
shivering
what
will
allan
mclane
daughters
say
your
sister
from
talbot
has
been
here
all
this
day
and
you
have
scarcely
given
her
an
hour
between
this
fatal
marriage
and
your
neglect
she
left
with
her
husband
positively
pale
with
horror
i
do
not
know
what
is
to
follow
this
marriage
i
have
posted
a
letter
already
to
my
brother
allan
telling
him
of
your
betrayal
by
your
father
and
this
bridegroom
all
our
connection
will
be
up
in
arms
vesta
heart
sank
again
but
she
felt
no
fears
of
her
husband
ability
to
meet
mere
family
opposition
secured
by
law
and
form
in
his
rights
she
only
feared
hostility
might
rouse
in
him
severity
and
defiance
which
would
neutralize
her
present
influence
upon
him
and
change
his
accommodating
almost
gentle
disposition
as
a
husband
for
blacker
than
any
object
in
her
future
path
she
saw
a
little
trivial
thing
like
a
wild
boar
closing
her
hitherto
adventurous
excursion
into
the
forest
where
her
husband
grew
the
hat
that
had
covered
his
head
her
mother
thoughtless
mention
of
that
object
made
it
formidable
to
her
fears
as
some
iron
mask
locked
round
her
husband
countenance
making
day
hideous
and
the
world
a
dungeon
to
all
who
must
walk
with
him
she
discerned
that
his
combative
spirit
would
start
to
the
defence
of
his
hat
if
it
should
become
the
subject
of
family
rancor
because
no
man
forgives
an
insult
to
his
personal
appearance
and
this
article
of
wear
had
ringed
his
brain
with
gangrene
and
war
made
upon
it
would
be
met
by
war
while
vesta
had
expected
to
induce
forgetfulness
of
the
rusty
old
tile
to
charm
away
the
remembrance
of
it
and
to
have
it
laid
forever
aside
i
am
not
the
daughter
of
uncle
mclane
vesta
protested
i
am
besides
a
woman
free
of
my
minority
milburn
is
hardly
the
man
to
submit
to
any
trespass
i
warn
you
mamma
to
put
my
uncle
at
no
disadvantage
for
my
husband
has
already
beaten
papa
and
he
will
smile
at
your
brother
when
he
knows
that
i
do
not
support
any
of
his
pretensions
the
first
thing
answered
custis
stubbornly
is
to
see
that
he
pays
this
check
oh
my
dear
money
she
pressed
it
to
her
heart
how
delightful
it
is
to
see
you
again
science
love
glory
ideas
how
vulgar
they
are
without
money
with
this
check
paid
i
think
i
shall
never
read
a
book
again
and
as
for
the
bog
ores
why
i
shall
scream
if
there
is
an
iron
article
in
the
house
vesta
this
house
i
believe
is
yours
now
i
had
forgotten
well
no
wonder
you
defend
the
man
who
took
your
father
roof
from
over
his
head
and
gave
it
to
you
that
is
unkind
mamma
i
value
it
only
as
a
sure
home
for
you
and
papa
if
i
gave
it
to
him
it
might
be
in
risk
again
but
suppose
you
continue
to
defend
this
monster
of
a
milburn
he
and
you
may
require
the
whole
house
i
am
too
to
be
converted
to
any
of
his
impious
ideas
i
am
a
baltimorean
and
stand
by
my
colors
let
us
speak
of
that
no
more
vesta
said
almost
in
despair
but
talk
of
dear
papa
i
know
he
loves
you
it
is
too
late
custis
remarked
solemnly
with
another
fondling
of
her
check
he
has
neglected
me
too
long
i
expect
his
attention
and
respect
and
that
he
shall
behave
himself
but
no
lovey
and
no
honey
for
me
now
life
has
passed
the
noon
and
the
early
afternoon
for
him
and
me
and
i
live
to
be
respectable
to
appreciate
my
security
to
keep
upstarts
at
to
enjoy
my
life
in
its
appointed
circle
taking
care
of
my
income
and
never
no
never
giving
any
human
being
the
opportunity
to
make
me
a
beggar
again
oh
mamma
vesta
said
think
of
judge
custis
have
you
not
made
home
cold
to
him
by
this
formalism
we
must
study
men
and
please
them
according
to
their
tastes
and
therein
lies
our
joy
else
we
are
false
to
the
companionship
god
gave
us
to
man
for
yield
to
your
fly
with
him
like
the
mate
by
the
bird
he
has
repented
welcome
him
to
your
love
again
and
stay
his
feet
from
truant
going
or
he
may
dash
down
the
precipice
this
sorrow
has
arrested
him
before
of
everlasting
dissipation
and
the
death
of
his
noble
soul
vesta
stood
above
her
mother
deeply
moved
deeply
earnest
her
mother
stole
another
look
at
the
bank
check
well
daughter
i
will
be
humbugged
by
him
if
you
desire
it
she
said
but
with
slight
answering
emotion
if
i
had
my
life
to
go
over
again
i
would
marry
a
business
man
and
let
the
aristocracy
go
there
is
the
second
knock
at
the
i
believe
i
will
dress
myself
and
go
too
there
were
two
ladies
in
the
parlor
when
vesta
went
there
grandmother
tilghman
and
the
widow
dennis
vesta
said
the
old
lady
who
was
but
easily
knew
vesta
footstep
william
thought
you
would
not
go
to
evening
service
on
account
of
milburn
illness
so
i
came
around
to
sit
till
church
was
over
when
he
will
take
me
home
but
what
is
that
i
hear
in
this
parlor
like
somebody
sniffling
it
me
aunt
vesty
said
the
voice
of
rhoda
holland
from
the
background
this
is
milburn
niece
who
has
come
here
to
stay
with
me
vesta
said
ah
then
it
is
no
custis
the
last
sniffle
i
heard
was
at
the
ball
to
lafayette
in
the
spring
of
the
marquis
had
marched
from
head
of
elk
to
the
bald
friars
ferry
up
the
susquehanna
and
inland
among
the
hills
to
baltimore
and
we
gave
him
a
ball
which
at
his
request
was
turned
into
a
he
snuffed
so
much
that
he
kept
up
a
sniffle
all
the
evening
like
here
rhoda
sniffle
was
heard
again
yes
that
a
good
imitation
said
grandmother
tilghman
but
i
like
it
did
the
gineral
dance
at
the
ball
asked
rhoda
what
did
he
do
with
his
swurd
did
he
dance
with
it
outen
his
scibburd
he
danced
like
a
gentleman
tilghman
replied
as
if
she
would
rather
not
and
led
me
out
in
the
first
set
you
danced
with
him
vesta
at
the
ball
in
years
afterwards
does
he
sniffle
yet
i
do
recollect
i
was
a
little
girl
and
so
much
flattered
that
i
thought
everything
he
did
was
perfect
ah
me
exclaimed
tilghman
pulling
the
feather
of
her
turban
up
and
looking
as
much
like
an
old
belle
as
possible
at
eighty
years
of
age
you
danced
before
lafayette
with
my
grandson
bill
bill
hardly
remembers
lafayette
at
all
thinking
of
you
that
night
so
wonderful
in
your
girl
charms
i
told
him
vesta
would
never
marry
him
as
he
was
too
plain
and
poor
but
i
never
thought
you
would
marry
that
here
rhoda
sniffled
warningly
yes
exclaimed
the
old
lady
catching
the
sniffle
i
never
thought
you
would
marry
but
bill
is
as
dear
a
fool
as
ever
he
says
now
that
meshach
milburn
is
a
good
man
too
i
never
thought
he
was
above
a
rhoda
sniffled
earnestly
precisely
that
exclaimed
the
old
lady
that
was
my
estimate
of
the
stock
bill
says
he
is
a
financial
genius
i
do
see
what
is
to
become
of
girls
in
this
generation
here
is
ellenora
too
good
to
marry
phoebus
the
sailor
man
too
poor
to
marry
anybody
else
now
if
milburn
had
married
her
and
taken
her
son
levin
into
his
business
it
would
have
been
reasonable
but
to
take
you
and
pervert
your
happiness
almost
makes
me
sniffle
from
rhoda
yes
said
the
old
lady
snappishly
almost
but
i
never
did
do
it
yet
did
you

to
her
caze
she
dreffle
smart
tilghman
vesta
interposed
to
the
blank
silence
of
the
room
knew
general
washington
intimately
do
tell
us
cried
rhoda
you
kin
be
a
right
interestin
ole
woman
i
reckon
ef
you
air
so
quar
in
the
midst
of
a
smile
in
which
the
blind
old
lady
herself
joined
and
custis
at
the
same
time
entered
the
room
tilghman
spoke
as
follows
i
went
to
visit
cousin
martha
washington
several
years
before
the
revolution
at
mount
vernon
i
had
seen
her
while
she
was
the
widow
of
cousin
custis
and
we
occasionally
corresponded
in
those
days
we
visited
by
vessel
so
a
schooner
of
robert
morris
father
set
me
ashore
at
mount
vernon
colonel
washington
was
then
having
his
first
portrait
painted
by
wilson
peale
and
he
was
forty
years
old
peale
and
washington
used
to
pitch
the
bar
play
quoits
and
while
cousin
martha
who
was
only
three
months
younger
than
the
colonel
knitted
and
cut
out
sewing
for
her
colored
girls
and
heard
her
daughter
martha
custis
play
the
harpsichord
poor
martha
had
the
consumption
she
was
dark
as
an
indian
washington
often
carried
her
along
the
piazza
and
into
the
beautiful
woodlands
near
the
house
but
she
died
leaving
him
all
her
money
nearly
twenty
thousand
dollars
we
custises
rather
looked
down
on
colonel
washington
in
those
days
he
was
not
of
the
old
gentry
his
poor
mother
could
barely
read
and
write
and
once
when
we
went
to
fredericksburg
to
see
her
she
was
riding
out
in
the
field
among
her
few
negroes
as
her
own
overseer
wearing
an
old
and
sunburned
like
a
forester
dear
me
exclaimed
custis
i
should
think
she
was
a
great
impediment
to
washington
i
reckon
that
the
way
her
son
got
big
exclaimed
rhoda
if
his
mar
had
laid
down
in
bed
all
day
he
could
have
killed
king
george
so
easy
with
his
swurd
i
often
said
to
cousin
martha
did
you
see
in
this
big
horse
of
a
man
she
replied
the
best
overseer
in
virginia
he
looks
after
my
property
as
no
other
man
could
then
said
custis
emphatically
he
was
one
man
out
of
a
thousand
that
the
kind
of
man
you
married
vesta
spoke
up
dennis
husband
said
custis
looked
after
her
father
property
i
am
sure
for
he
got
it
all
and
returned
it
all
exclaimed
vesta
custis
remarked
that
washington
certainly
was
a
man
is
thar
people
with
blue
blood
comin
outen
of
asked
rhoda
holland
lord
sakes
i
should
think
it
would
make
cold
i
wonder
if
men
are
ever
great
asked
vesta
or
whether
it
is
not
great
occasion
and
trial
that
project
them
a
crisis
comes
in
our
lives
and
finding
what
we
can
endure
we
incur
greater
risks
and
finally
delight
in
such
adventure
that
is
the
way
with
my
poor
boy
levin
said
dennis
quietly
to
vesta
she
was
a
pretty
woman
somewhat
past
thirty
with
rosy
cheeks
blue
eyes
neat
but
rather
poor
attire
and
a
simple
artless
manner
and
might
have
passed
for
the
sister
of
her
son
is
levin
coming
for
you
vesta
asked
no
blushed
the
widow
james
phoebus
will
see
me
home
levin
has
gone
off
in
his
boat
and
i
have
been
worried
about
him
all
day
some
time
i
am
afraid
he
will
go
and
never
return
oh
cousin
vesta
this
waiting
for
a
husband
neither
alive
nor
dead
is
very
trying
overhearing
the
remark
custis
remarked
norah
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
keep
that
faithful
fellow
waiting
on
you
when
you
could
give
yourself
a
good
husband
and
reward
him
so
easily
i
think
you
had
better
look
out
for
old
age
tilghman
also
said
while
you
have
youth
and
good
looks
to
obtain
the
provision
oden
dennis
is
probably
dead
if
not
dead
he
does
not
mean
to
return
for
i
can
think
of
no
circumstances
in
this
age
which
would
forcibly
detain
a
man
from
his
wife
fifteen
years
even
if
he
was
in
a
prison
he
would
be
allowed
to
write
to
you
he
may
not
be
dead
norah
but
he
is
not
coming
back
get
a
father
for
your
son
you
can
not
manage
levin
maybe
he
has
been
stoled
by
injins
exclaimed
rhoda
with
great
fervor
thar
was
a
injin
captive
in
a
shew
at
that
had
been
kept
nineteen
years
he
forgot
his
language
and
whooped
dreffle
misc
somers
say
he
was
an
imploster
an
worked
on
the
brekwater
up
to
lewistown
she
always
lookin
behind
the
shew
to
find
out
somethin
slight
sniffle
do
get
that
girl
a
and
show
her
how
to
use
it
exclaimed
tilghman
breaking
out
ah
girls
i
have
been
a
widow
thirty
years
i
never
gave
up
the
expectation
of
marrying
again
till
i
lost
my
eyesight
and
even
after
that
at
i
had
an
offer
of
marriage
but
i
said
to
my
gallant
old
beau
will
not
take
a
man
i
can
not
compliment
by
seeing
him
and
admiring
him
every
day
i
love
you
but
my
blindness
would
give
you
too
much
pain
in
our
quiet
towns
all
the
life
worth
living
is
domestic
joy
do
not
lose
it
ellenora
do
not
put
it
off
too
long
i
could
love
phoebus
plain
as
he
is
the
widow
spoke
if
i
could
persuade
myself
that
oden
is
dead
but
that
i
can
not
do
a
real
person
spirit
or
man
is
watching
over
me
closely
my
very
shoes
i
wear
came
from
that
mysterious
agent
it
is
not
my
son
it
is
not
james
phoebus
no
other
stranger
would
so
secretly
assist
me
i
am
bound
up
in
the
fear
and
wonder
that
it
is
my
husband
that
does
beat
conjecture
said
old
tilghman
have
you
no
friend
you
might
suspect
none
the
widow
answered
none
who
have
not
worn
out
their
means
of
giving
long
ago
can
i
marry
with
this
ghostly
visitation
coming
so
regularly
should
i
not
have
faith
in
a
husband
living
if
i
receive
a
wife
care
from
an
unseen
hand
oden
dennis
custis
remarked
was
hardly
a
man
to
do
charity
and
not
be
seen
he
was
rather
demonstrative
and
restless
i
can
not
think
of
his
nocturnal
visits
in
the
body
besides
he
would
not
supply
you
in
that
way
norah
if
he
meant
to
come
back
and
if
he
can
not
himself
come
to
you
neither
could
he
send
not
altogether
relishing
tilghman
reproof
rhoda
was
again
heard
from
saying
lord
sakes
all
the
women
has
to
talk
about
when
they
is
gone
is
the
men
when
the
men
comes
they
talks
as
if
they
never
missed
of
misc
somers
she
never
had
no
man
an
she
talks
mos
about
the
women
that
has
got
one
i
think
aunt
vesty
has
got
the
best
man
in
prencess
anne
he
the
richest
he
the
freest
he
never
courted
no
other
gal
he
ai
got
no
quar
old
women
runnin
of
him
down
caze
misc
somers
is
dreffle
afraid
of
him
this
last
remark
seemed
apologetic
and
an
afterthought
i
am
beginning
to
think
my
fortune
is
better
than
i
deserve
vesta
replied
to
soften
the
application
as
wine
tea
and
cake
were
brought
in
now
dear
friends
as
i
am
milburn
wife
let
us
all
be
christians
this
sunday
night
and
drink
his
health
and
happy
recovery
and
that
he
may
never
repent
his
marriage
they
drank
with
some
hesitation
except
the
bride
rhoda
and
dennis
tilghman
needed
the
wine
too
much
to
wait
long
and
custis
finding
she
was
observed
took
a
sip
from
her
glass
also
excusing
herself
on
the
ground
of
a
recent
headache
from
drinking
heartily
as
the
conversation
proceeded
now
by
general
participation
again
by
couples
apart
and
vesta
found
herself
more
and
more
a
subject
of
sympathy
with
no
little
curiosity
interwoven
in
it
she
also
imagined
that
an
undertone
of
belief
was
abroad
that
she
had
made
a
mercenary
marriage
old
tilghman
in
her
prime
a
most
caustic
belle
and
worldly
as
three
marriages
all
shrewdly
contracted
could
make
her
seemed
determined
to
hold
that
vesta
had
rejected
her
grandson
for
the
on
the
consideration
of
wealth
vesta
own
mother
too
who
should
have
known
her
well
had
twice
hinted
the
same
even
the
inoffensive
ellenora
had
accepted
that
idea
or
another
kin
to
it
and
rhoda
holland
had
remembered
that
her
uncle
was
the
richest
of
bridegrooms
in
princess
anne
vesta
felt
the
injustice
but
said
to
herself
i
must
make
the
sacrifice
complete
and
incur
any
harsh
judgment
it
may
bear
i
see
that
i
shall
be
driven
for
sympathy
to
the
last
place
in
the
world
i
anticipated
to
my
husband
heart
yes
there
is
something
besides
love
in
marriage
if
i
can
not
love
him
he
can
understand
me
vesta
had
come
to
a
place
all
come
to
who
volunteer
an
act
of
great
sacrifice
to
have
it
put
upon
a
low
motive
from
the
lower
plane
of
sacrifice
in
many
otherwise
kind
people
we
give
our
money
to
an
institution
of
charity
and
it
is
said
that
it
was
for
notoriety
or
or
at
the
expense
of
our
kin
we
lead
a
forlorn
hope
in
politics
or
some
other
arena
to
establish
a
cause
or
assist
a
principle
with
the
certain
result
of
defeat
and
we
are
said
to
be
jealous
or
malignant
perhaps
we
make
a
book
to
illustrate
some
old
region
off
the
highways
of
observation
drawn
to
it
by
kindred
strings
or
early
patterings
and
the
politician
there
regards
it
as
an
attack
the
old
family
fossil
as
an
intrusion
the
very
youth
as
if
it
were
a
queer
and
gratuitous
thing
from
such
an
outer
source
so
we
wince
a
little
but
feel
that
it
was
necessary
to
be
misunderstood
to
complete
the
sacrifice
the
feeling
of
despondency
increased
after
the
little
company
separated
and
vesta
went
to
her
room
and
laid
herself
upon
her
still
maiden
bed
she
had
said
her
prayer
and
asked
the
approval
of
god
but
her
nervous
system
under
the
tension
of
almost
two
days
excitement
and
events
such
as
she
had
never
known
was
alert
and
could
not
fall
to
slumber
old
passages
of
testament
lore
haunted
her
soul
such
as
thy
desire
shall
be
to
thy
husband
and
he
shall
rule
over
thee
a
man
shall
leave
his
father
and
his
mother
and
shall
cleave
unto
his
wife
she
began
to
see
that
marriage
was
not
merely
the
solution
of
a
family
trouble
and
the
giving
of
her
body
as
a
hostage
for
a
pecuniary
debt
but
that
it
was
a
rendition
of
all
her
liberty
even
the
liberty
of
sympathy
and
of
sorrow
to
the
man
to
whom
she
must
cleave
in
marrying
him
she
had
left
friendship
father
and
mother
everything
at
a
greater
distance
than
she
ever
dreamed
and
they
resented
the
desertion
to
the
degree
that
they
now
confounded
her
with
her
new
interest
let
go
their
claim
upon
her
and
could
scarce
conceive
of
her
except
in
the
dual
relation
of
a
woman
subject
to
her
husband
and
selfish
as
himself
i
wonder
if
he
will
grow
weary
of
me
too
she
thought
with
anguish
after
his
possession
is
established
and
i
shall
have
no
other
source
of
confidence
what
did
i
know
of
this
world
only
yesterday
then
every
way
seemed
clear
and
open
for
me
my
friends
abundant
and
love
profuse
i
am
in
awful
doubts
and
yet
i
must
not
lose
my
will
and
drift
with
every
passing
fear
and
confusion
into
the
fickleness
which
makes
woman
contemptible
after
she
has
given
her
hand
i
will
never
give
up
two
persons
my
father
and
my
husband
as
she
turned
down
the
lamp
it
being
nearly
midnight
a
short
fierce
cry
quickly
stifled
as
if
some
wild
animal
had
howled
once
in
nightmare
and
fallen
asleep
in
his
kennel
again
seized
on
her
ears
and
chilled
her
blood
vesta
started
up
in
bed
and
listened
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
were
footsteps
but
they
passed
away
and
she
listened
in
vain
for
any
other
sounds
till
sleep
fell
deep
and
dreamless
upon
her
like
black
lethe
winding
through
a
desert
chapter
xxi
long
separations
vesta
was
awakened
by
roxy
virgie
and
her
mother
all
standing
around
her
bed
at
once
exclaiming
something
unintelligible
together
it
was
late
morning
the
whole
family
having
slept
long
after
the
several
experiences
of
two
such
days
and
the
sun
was
shining
through
the
great
trees
before
teackle
hall
and
burnishing
the
windows
so
that
vesta
could
hardly
see
the
kitchen
servants
have
run
away
custis
shrieked
on
request
that
her
mother
only
should
talk
old
hominy
is
gone
and
has
taken
all
her
herbs
and
witcheries
with
her
and
all
the
young
children
bred
in
the
kitchen
ned
and
vince
the
boys
and
little
phillis
the
baby
they
too
are
gone
i
heard
a
strange
cry
or
howl
last
night
as
i
dropped
to
sleep
vesta
exclaimed
rubbing
her
eyes
dear
missy
cried
virgie
falling
upon
the
pillow
it
was
your
poor
dog
turk
his
throat
has
been
cut
upon
the
lawn
yes
missy
roxy
blubbered
poor
turk
lies
in
his
blood
there
is
nobody
to
get
breakfast
but
virgie
and
me
indeed
we
did
not
know
about
it
that
is
not
very
likely
said
the
suspicious
custis
i
know
you
did
not
girls
vesta
said
you
have
too
much
intelligence
and
principle
i
am
sure
nor
could
hominy
have
been
so
inhuman
to
my
poor
dog
vesta
at
once
rose
up
and
threw
on
her
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
have
breakfast
roxy
do
you
go
at
once
to
milburn
and
bring
his
man
samson
here
and
awake
miss
holland
to
take
samson
place
by
her
uncle
tell
samson
to
make
the
fire
and
you
and
he
get
the
breakfast
no
person
is
to
speak
of
this
incident
of
the
kitchen
servants
leaving
us
on
any
pretence
wo
you
give
the
alarm
the
first
thing
cried
custis
not
very
well
pleased
to
see
vesta
keep
her
temper
they
may
be
overtaken
before
they
get
far
away
daughter
those
four
negroes

worth
twelve
hundred
dollars
they
are
not
worth
one
dollar
mamma
if
they
have
run
away
from
us
because
i
should
never
either
sell
them
or
keep
them
again
if
they
had
behaved
so
treacherously
i
say
sell
them
and
get
the
money
custis
cried
are
they
not
ours
no
mamma
they
are
mine
milburn
and
papa
are
to
be
consulted
before
any
steps
are
taken
papa
deeded
them
to
me
only
last
saturday
why
should
they
have
deserted
at
the
moment
i
had
redeemed
them
virgie
can
you
guess
virgie
hesitated
only
a
moment
miss
vesty
i
think
i
can
see
what
made
hominy
go
she
was
afraid
of
meshach
milburn
and
his
queer
hat
she
believed
the
devil
give
it
to
him
she
thought
he
had
bought
her
by
marrying
you
and
was
going
to
christen
her
to
the
bad
man
or
do
something
dreadful
with
her
and
the
little
children
that
it
miss
vessy
plump
little
roxy
added
hominy
loved
the
little
children
dearly
she
thought
they
was
to
become
meshach
and
she
must
save
them
poor
superstitious
creature
vesta
exclaimed
more
misery
brought
about
by
that
fool
hat
cried
custis
if
i
ever
lay
hands
on
it
it
shall
end
in
the
fire
no
wonder
vesta
said
that
this
poor
ignorant
woman
should
do
herself
such
an
injury
on
account
of
an
article
of
dress
that
disturbs
liberal
and
enlightened
minds
now
i
recollect
that
hominy
said
something
about
having
quaker
what
did
it
mean
the
two
slave
girls
looked
at
each
other
significantly
and
virgie
answered
do
the
quakers
help
slaves
to
get
off
to
a
free
state
maybe
she
meant
that
do
you
suppose
the
abolitionists
would
tamper
with
a
poor
old
woman
like
that
whose
liberty
would
neither
be
a
credit
to
them
nor
a
comfort
to
her
i
can
not
think
so
meanly
of
them
vesta
reflected
besides
could
she
have
killed
my
dog
a
gross
ignorant
negro
would
kill
a
dog
or
a
child
or
anything
when
she
is
possessed
with
a
devil
custis
insisted
i
do
believe
she
killed
turk
roxy
remarked
as
she
left
the
room
there
was
a
white
man
in
the
kitchen
last
saturday
night
i
think
he
slept
there
master
gave
him
leave
yes
missy
virgie
continued
after
roxy
had
gone
to
obey
her
orders
he
was
a
dreadful
man
and
looked
at
me
so
coarse
and
familiar
that
i
have
dreamed
of
him
since
it
was
the
man
milburn
knocked
down
for
mashing
his
hat
he
was
afraid
milburn
would
throw
him
into
jail
so
he
asked
master
to
hide
in
the
kitchen
but
hominy
was
almost
crazy
with
fear
of
milburn
before
that
vesta
held
up
her
beautiful
arms
with
a
look
of
despair
what
has
not
that
poor
old
hat
brought
upon
every
body
she
cried
oh
who
dares
contest
the
sunshine
with
the
tailor
and
hatter
they
are
the
despots
that
never
will
abdicate
or
die
the
idea
of
your
father
letting
a
tramp
like
that
sleep
in
the
kitchen
among
the
slaves
cried
custis
what
obligation
had
he
incurred
there
too
i
should
like
to
know
teackle
hall
is
become
a
cave
of
owls
and
foxes
it
is
time
for
me
to
leave
it
here

my

worst
enemy
leaving

goldsboroughs
there
till

order

out
of
this
attempt
to

wheat
and
tares
together
vesta
stopped
a
moment
and
kissed
her
mother
that
is
just
the
thing
dear
mother
she
said

out
the

foresters
abolitionists
runaways

by

descending

the
yard
vesta
found
turk
lying
in
his
blood
his
mastiff
jaws
and
shaggy
sides
clotted
red
and
as
it
seemed
the
howl
in
which
he
died
still
lingering
in
the
air
the
virginia
spirit
rose
in
eyes
whoever
killed
this
dog
only
wanted
the
courage
to
kill
men
she
exclaimed
james

superstitious
fear
she

every

big
and
little
is
afraid
of

hat
he

nor
has
my

now
i
will
tell
you
james
relying
on
your
prudence
that

belonged
to

and
so
did
those
three
children
having
passed
from
my
father
to
my
husband
and
thence
to
me
and
back
to
my
father
and
from
him
to

very
hour
of
my

fear
they
have
been
persuaded

sold
out
of

jimmy
phoebus
looked
up
at
the
sighing
trees
and
over
the
wide
façade
of
teackle

and
exclaimed
by
smoke
several
times
before
he
made
his
conclusions
miss
vesty
he
said
finally
send

the
charge
made
with
an
honest
man
want
of

down
all
explanations
i
confess
it
said
vesta
papa
going
away
on
a
sunday
and
these
people
disappearing
on
sunday
night
might
excite
idle
comment
it
might
be

to
sell
some
of
his
property
before
his
creditor
could
seize
it
i

james
said
the
widow
with
the
timid
step
and
ready
blush
levin
is
gone
for
a
week
with
a
negro
trader
he
sends
me
so
much
money
i
fear
he
is
under
an
unusual
temptation
and
wonnell
says
the
trader
is
giving
him
liquor
what
shall
i
do
make
me
his
father
ellenory
and
that
give
me
an
interest
over
him
and

a
first

levin

ca
measure
money

a
nigger
trader
by
smoke

control
it
when
my
way
is
clear
you
will
have
but
to
ask
do
go
and
find
levin
norah
we
suspect
the
same
trader
of
having
taken
off
hominy
our
cook
and
the
kitchen
children
in
levin
boat
the
widow
listened
to
vesta
and
burst
into
tears
he
will
be
accessory
to
the
crime
she
sobbed
oh
this
is
what
i
have
ever
feared
james
phoebus
you
have
always
had
the
best
influence
over
levin
if
you
love
me
arrest
him
before
the
law
takes
cognizance
of
this
wild
deed
where
has
he
gone
virgie
appeared
upon
the
lawn
to
say
that
custis
wanted

as

where
she
could
get
a
slave
of
her
to

james
vesta
said
rapidly
thinking
samson
can
take
you
to
spring
hill
church
or
barren
creek
springs
by
a
little
deviation
and
at
the
springs
you
will
be
only
three
miles
from

nanticoke
even

carriage

springs
or

of
them

exclaimed

virgie
herself
exclaimed
her
slight
nervous
willowy
figure
expanding
are
you
afraid
to
go
into
a
freer
state
than
maryland
if
i
was
free
i
would
want
to
go
to
the
freest
state
of
all
behave
like
a
free
man
samson
hat
or
what
is
freedom
worth
to
you
it
wuth
so
much
pretty
gal
dat
i
do
want
to
be
of
it
mind
i
tell
you
to
my
wife
when
she
hab
me
samson
watched
the
quadroon
delicate
features
her
skin
almost
paler
than
her
young
mistress
her
figure
like
the
after
a
hard
winter
the
more
active
that
a
little
meagre
her
head
small
and
its
tresses
soft
as
the
crow
blackbird
plumage
and
the
loyalty
that
lay
in
her
large
eyes
like
strong
passion
for
her
mistress
was
turned
to
pride
and
nearly
scorn
when
they
listened
to
him
a
slave
miss
vesty
says
virgie
spoke
with
almost
fierceness
is
not
one
that
owned
half
as
much
as
one
that
sells
himself
to
hard
drink
or
to
selfishness
or
to
fear
you
not
a
free
man
samson
if
afraid
and
are
like
these
low
slave
negroes
who
dare
nothing
if
they
can
only
get
a
little
low
pleasure
all
that
can
make
a
black
man
white
in
my
eyes
is
a
white
man
enterprise
vesta
felt
as
she
often
had
done
the
capable
soul
of
her
servant
and
did
not
resent
her
spirit
as
unbecoming
a
slave
but
rather
felt
responsive
chords
in
her
own
nature
as
if
indeed
virgie
was
the
more
imperious
of
the
two
coming
now
into
full
womanhood
her
race
elements
finding
their
composition
her
character
unrestrained
by
any
one
in
teackle
hall
virgie
was
her
young
mistress
like
david
to
the
princely
jonathan
why
virgie
samson
answered
with
humility
i
never
meant
not
to
go
lady
gal
after
marster
wife
asked
me
i
only
wanted
you
to
beg
me
hard
an
mebbe
i
git
a
kiss
befo
i
started
wait
till
you
come
back
and
see
if
you
do
your
errand
well
virgie
spoke
again
i
shall
not
kiss
you
now
i
will
cried
little
roxy
to
the
amusement
of
them
all
giving
samson
a
hearty
smack
from
her
little
pouting
mouth
and
now
you
got
it
think
it
virgie
kiss
and
get
your
breakfast
and
start
as
they
went
to
their
abodes
to
make
ready
jimmy

an
foolish
as

maybe
your

will
ruin
you
the
road
to
salisbury
laid
out
in
when
cecil
lord
of
maryland
and
avalon
erected
a
county
in
honor
of
our
dear
sister
the
lady
mary
somerset
followed
the
across
the
little
and
pierced
the
flat
and
open
farms
and
passed
through
two
little
hamlets
before
our
travellers
saw
the
broad
and
poplar
and
mulberry
lined
streets
of
the
most
active
town
albeit
without
a
in
the
lower
peninsula
jimmy
phoebus
driving
the
two
horses
and
the
family
carriage
and
samson
following
on
his
mule
descended
into
the
hollow
of
salisbury
at
the
and
stopped
at
the
hotel
the
snore
of
the
rasp
of
the
flow
of
into
the
gorge
of
the
village
the
forest
impudently
intruding
into
the
streets
and
humidity
of
ivy
and
creeper
over
many
of
the
old
houses
the
long
reflected
in
the
swampy
harbor
among
the
canoes
pungies
and
sharpies
moored
there
the
small
houses
sidewise
to
the
sandy
streets
the
larger
ones
rising
up
the
sandy
hills
the
old
in
the
silvery
gardens
the
bridges
close
together
and
the
smell
of
tar
and
sawdust
pleasantly
inhaled
upon
the
lungs
made
a
combination
like
a
caravan
around
some
pool
in
the
desert
of
the
nile
if
there
is
any
chance
to
catch
my
negroes
custis
said
i
will
go
right
on
after
dinner
samson
send
dave
my
daughter
boy
to
me
immediately
he
is
working
in
this
hotel
samson
found
dave
to
be
none
other
than
the
black
he
had
failed
to
overcome
at
the
beginning
of
our
narrative
but
changes
were
visible
in
that
individual
samson
had
not
expected
from
having
a
clean
godly
modest
countenance
becoming
his
professions
dave
now
wore
a
sour
evil
look
his
eyes
were
and
his
straight
manly
shoulders
and
chest
which
had
once
exacted
samson
admiration
and
envy
were
stooped
to
conform
with
a
cough
he
ever
and
anon
made
from
deep
in
his
frame
dave
said
samson
your
missis
modder
wants
you
boy
to
drive
her

vienny

repeated
the
huge
slave
with
a
scowl
partly
of
revenge
and
partly
remorse
you
set
up
my
conceit
dat
i
could
box
i
had
never
struck

dave
muttered
going
and
as
he
passed
out
of
the
he
looked
back
at
samson
fiercely
and
exclaimed
may
satan
burn
your
body
as
he
will
burn
my
soul
i
hate
you
man
long
as
you
live
jimmy
phoebus
remarked
a
few
moments
afterwards
that
dave
dividing
a
pint
of
spirits
with
a
lean
little
mulatto
boy
put
a
piece
of
money
in
the
boy
hands
who
then
rode
rapidly
out
of
the
upon
a
fleet
chincoteague
pony
at
two
they
again
set
forward
the
man
dave
driving
the
carriage
and
jimmy
phoebus
sitting
beside
him
while
samson
easily
kept
alongside
upon
his
old
roan
mule
the
road
becoming
more
sandy
as
they
ascended
the
plateau
between
the
wicomico
and
nanticoke
and
the
carriage
drawing
hard
if
it
is
too
late
to
keep
on
beyond
vienna
said
custis
i

with
my
friends
the
turpins
and
start
again
after

in
the
morning
and

samson
spoke
and
i
kin
feed
my
mule
at
sundown
in
laurel
an
go
to
sleep
in
an
hour
they
came
in
sight
of
old
spring
hill
church
a
venerable
relic
of
the
colonial
established
church
at
the
sources
of
a
creek
called
rewastico
and
before
they
crossed
the
creek
the
driver
dave
called
ho
ho
in
such
an
unnecessarily
loud
voice
that
custis
reproved
him
sharply
dave
jumped
down
from
the
seat
and
appeared
to
be
examining
some
part
of
the
breeching
though
samson
assured
him
that
it
was
all
right
as
dave
finished
his
examination
he
raised
both
hands
above
his
head
twice
and
stretched
to
the
height
of
his
figure
as
he
stood
on
the
brow
of
a
little
hill
missy
custis
he
apologized
as
he
turned
back
i

david
custis

sharply
and
that
tavern
is
no
place
to
hire
you
to
with
your
appetite
for
drink
as
i
shall
tell
your
master
at
this
moment
jimmy
phoebus
observed
the
lean
little
mulatto
boy
who
had
left
the
hotel
come
up
out
of
the
swampy
place
in
the
road
and
exchange
a
look
of
intelligence
with
dave
as
he
rode
past
on
the
pony
boy
cried
samson
is
dat
de
road
to
laurel
the
boy
made
no
answer
but
looking
back
once
timidly
ground
his
heels
into
the
pony
flank
and
darted
into
the
brush
towards
salisbury
samson
spoke
dave

samson
and
trotted
his
mule
through
the
swamp
and
away
jimmy
phoebus
saw
him
overtake
the
old
woman
in
the
cart
and
begin
to
speak
with
her
as
the
scrubby
woods
swallowed
them
in
what
dat
he
said
about
joe
johnson
observed
dave
after
a
bad
spell
of
coughing
as
they
cleared
the
old
church
and
entered
the
sandy
custis
spoke
up
more
promptly
than
jimmy
phoebus
desired
and
told
the
negro
about
the
escape
of
hominy
and
the
children
and
the
hope
of
phoebus
to
head
the
party
off
as

dave
said
in
a
low
frightened

glance
at

of
his
companions
out
of
his
fiery
scarred
eyes
kidnappin

dave
listened
to
this
recital
with
such
a
deep
interest
that
his
breath
strong
with
apple
whiskey
came
short
and
hot
and
his
hands
trembled
as
he
guided
the
horses
at
the
last
words
he
exclaimed
samson
knocked
joe
johnson
down
den
de
debbil
has
got
him
and
means
to
pay
him
back
what
that
cried
jimmy
phoebus
the
sweat
stood
on
the
big
slave
forehead
as
if
his
imagination
was
terribly
possessed
but
before
he
could
explain
custis
interrupted
i
think
it
was
said
that
old
patty
cannon
corrupted
jake
purnell
who
cut
his
throat
at
snow
hill
five
years
ago
he
was
a
free
negro
who
engaged
slaves
to
steal
other
slaves
and
bring
them
to
him
and
he
delivered
them
up
to
the
white
kidnappers
for
money
and
nobody
could
account
for
his
prosperity
till
a
negro
who
had
been
beaten
to
death
was
found
in
the
pocomoke
river
and
three
slaves
who
had
been
seen
in
his
company
were
arrested
for
the
murder
they
confessed
that
they
had
stolen
the
dead
negro
and
he
had
escaped
from
them
and
was
so
beaten
with
clubs
to
make
him
tractable
that
when
they
gave
him
to
purnell
his
life
was
all
gone
then
he
was
thrown
in
the
river
but
his
body
came
up
after
sinking
and
the
confession
of
the
wretched
tools
explained
to
the
where
all
their
missing
negroes
had
gone
they
marched
and
surrounded
purnell
hut
and
he
was
discovered
burrowed
beneath
it
they
brought
the
dogs
and
fire
to
drive
him
out
and
as
he
came
out
he
cut
his
throat
with
desperate
slashes
from
ear
to
ear
during
this
narrative
the
man
dave
had
listened
with
rising
nervous
excitement
rolling
his
eyes
as
if
in
strong
inward
torment
till
the
concluding
words
inspired
such
terror
in
him
that
he
dropped
the
reins
threw
back
his
head
and
shouted
with
large
beads
of
sweat
all
round
his
brow
mercy
mercy
have
mercy
save
me
oh
my
lord
he
got
a
fit
i
reckon
cried
jimmy
phoebus
promptly
grasping
the
reins
as
the
horses
started
at
the
cry
and
with
his
leg
pinning
dave
to
the
at
that
moment
the
road
descended
into
the
hollow
of
barren
creek
and
leaping
down
at
the
old
mineral
springs
hotel
a
health
resort
of
those
days
phoebus
humanely
procured
water
and
freshened
up
the
gasping
negro
face
i
declare
i
am
almost
afraid
to
trust
myself
to
this
man
custis
observed
with
more
distaste
than
trepidation
every
nigger
in
this
region
exclaimed
jimmy
phoebus
thinks
pangymonum
comin
down
at
the
dreaded
name
of
patty
cannon
an
this
nigger
gone
most
to
ruin
any
way

exclaimed
the
slave
recovering
his
speech
and
glaring
wildly
around
i

always
the
pore
sinner

has
made
of
me
i
served

purnell
it
made
me
yell
to
de
good

mercy
oh
my
soul
his
frightful
agitation
increased
and
jimmy
phoebus
soothed
him
saying
custis
i
reckon
you

let
him
come
in
the
tavern
and
take
a
little
sperits
it
strengthen
his
nerves
an
make
him
drive
better
as
they
drank
at
the
old
bar
at
that
time
in
the
height
of
its
celebrity
and
the
only
on
the
peninsula
south
of
the
brandywine
springs
phoebus
spoke
low

negro

man
whip
in
hand
and
after
delaying
a
little
there
i
shall
go
on
the
sharptown
ferry
and
cross
the
river
phoebus
accepted
the
invitation
immediately
and
cautioning
custis
to
speak
with
less
freedom
in
that
part
of
the
country
he
bade
her
adieu
and
took
the
vacant
seat
in
the
stranger
buggy
when
custis
came
to
vienna
ferry
and
the
horses
and
carriage
went
on
board
the
scow
to
be
rowed
to
the
little
old
shipping
settlement
of
that
name
the
negro
dave
standing
at
the
horses
heads
exchanged
a
few
sentences
with
the
dave
called
custis
a
little
later
on
you
have
no
love
i
see
for
old
samson
he
made
a
boxer
outen
me
an
a
bad
man
missis
do
you
know
the
man
he
works
for
meshach
milburn
no
missis
i
never
see
him
he
wears
a
peculiar
hat
nothing
like
gentlemen
hats
nowadays
it
is
a
hat
out
of
a
thousand
i
never
did
see
it
missis
you
can
not
mistake
it
for
any
other
hat
in
the
world
now
samson
is
the
only
servant
and
watchman
at
milburn
store
and
he
attends
to
that
disgraceful
hat
if
you
can
ever
get
it
from
him
dave
and
destroy
it
you
will
be
doing
a
useful
act
and
i
will
reward
you
well
the
moody
negro
looked
up
from
his
remorseful
brutalized
orbs
and
said
steal
it
oh
no
i
do
not
advise
a
theft
david
though
such
a
wretched
hat
can
have
no
legal
value
it
is
an
affliction
to
my
daughter
and
judge
custis
and
all
of
us
and
you
might
find
some
way
to
destroy
it
that
is
all
i
git
it
some
day
the
negro
muttered
and
drove
into
the
old
of
vienna
chapter
xxii
nanticoke
people
a
map
would
be
out
of
place
in
a
story
yet
there
are
probably
some
who
perceive
that
this
is
a
story
with
a
reality
and
if
such
will
take
any
atlas
and
open
it
at
the
middle
states
of
the
american
republic
they
will
see
that
the
little
state
of
delaware
is
fitted
as
nicely
into
a
square
niche
of
maryland
as
if
it
were
a
lamp
or
piece
of
statuary
standing
on
a
mantelpiece
it
stands
there
on
a
mantelshelf
about
forty
miles
wide
and
rises
to
more
than
three
times
that
height
making
a
perfectly
straight
north
and
south
line
at
right
angles
with
its
base
thus
mortised
into
maryland
its
ragged
eastern
line
is
formed
of
the
atlantic
ocean
and
the
broad
delaware
bay
the
only
considerable
river
within
this
narrow
strip
or
of
a
state
is
the
nanticoke
which
like
a
crack
in
the
wall
and
the
same
blow
fractured
the
image
on
the
mantel
flows
with
breadth
and
tidal
ebb
and
flow
from
the
chesapeake
bay
through
the
eastern
shore
of
maryland
into
delaware
and
is
there
formed
of
two
tidal
sources
the
one
to
the
north
continuing
to
be
called
the
nanticoke
and
that
to
the
south
nearly
as
imposing
a
stream
named
broad
creek
nature
therefore
as
if
anticipating
some
foolish
political
boundaries
on
the
part
of
man
prepared
one
drain
and
channel
of
ingress
at
the
southwestern
corner
of
delaware
to
the
splendid
bay
of
virginia
around
that
corner
of
the
little
delaware
commonwealth
in
a
flat
poor
sandy
soil
jimmy
phoebus
rode
by
the
stranger
in
the
afternoon
of
october
with
the
sun
an
hour
high
in
the
west
shining
upon
his
dark
greekish
cheeks
and
neck
and
he
hearing
the
fall
birds
whistle
and
cackle
in
the
mellowing
stubble
and
golden
thickets
the
the
boy
delight
was
picking
seed
gravel
and
insects
eggs
in
the
fields
large
and
with
breast
washed
yellow
from
the
bill
to
the
very
knees
except
at
the
throat
where
hangs
a
brilliant
reticule
of
blackish
brown
his
head
and
back
are
of
hawkish
colors
umber
brown
and
gray
and
in
his
carriage
is
something
of
the
gamecock
he
flies
high
sometimes
alone
sometimes
in
the
flock
and
is
our
winter
visitor
loving
the
old
fields
improvidence
has
abandoned
and
uttering
as
he
feeds
the
loud
sounds
of
challenge
as
if
to
cry
abandoned
by
man
by
me
jimmy
phoebus
also
heard
the
bold
bantering
woodpecker
with
his
red
head
whose
schoolmaster
is
the
squirrel
and
whose
tactics
of
keeping
a
tree
between
him
and
his
enemy
the
indian
fighters
adopted
he
mimics
the
cry
and
migrates
after
october
like
other
voluptuaries
who
must
have
the
round
year
warm
and
fruit
and
eggs
always
in
market
dressed
in
his
speckled
black
coat
with
his
long
pen
in
his
mouth
and
his
faultlessly
white
the
woodpecker
works
like
some
balzac
in
his
garret
making
the
lively
as
he
spars
with
his
and
being
sure
himself
of
a
tree
and
clinging
to
it
with
both
tail
and
talons
he
esteems
everything
else
that
lives
upon
it
to
be
an
insect
at
which
he
may
run
his
bill
or
spit
his
tongue
that
tongue
which
is
rooted
in
the
brain
itself
in
the
hollow
golden
bowl
of
echoing
evening
the
sailor
noted
too
the
flicker
in
golden
pencilled
wings
and
back
of
speckled
umber
and
mottled
white
breast
with
collar
and
neck
and
head
of
cinnamon
his
golden
tail
droops
far
below
his
perch
and
running
downward
along
the
it
flashes
in
the
air
like
a
sceptre
over
the
he
devours
with
his
pickaxe
bill
go
to
the
ant
thou
sluggard
was
an
instigation
to
murder
in
the
flicker
who
loves
young
ants
as
much
as
or
indian
corn
and
is
capable
of
taking
any
such
satire
seriously
upon
things
to
eat
not
so
elfin
and
devilish
as
the
small
black
woodpecker
he
is
full
of
bolder
play
the
redbird
like
the
unclaimed
blood
of
abel
flew
to
the
little
trees
that
grew
low
as
if
to
cover
abel
altar
the
chirped
in
the
swampy
spots
like
a
divinity
student
on
his
clean
long
legs
probing
with
his
bill
and
critical
eye
the
scriptures
of
the
fields
the
quail
piped
like
an
old
bachelor
with
family
cares
at
last
as
he
led
his
mate
where
the
wild
seeds
were
best
and
through
the
air
darted
voices
of
birds
forsaken
or
on
doctor
errands
crying
phoebe
phoebe
or
killed
he
killed
he
are
you
a
dealer
asked
the
gentleman
of
jimmy
phoebus
just
a
little
that
way
said
jimmy
warily
when
i
kin
git
cheap
the
stranger
had
a
pair
of
keen
dancing
eyes
and
a
long
eloquent
face
that
might
have
suited
a
great
general
so
fine
was
its
command
and
yet
too
narrowly
dancing
in
the
eyes
like
spiders
in
a
well
disturbing
the
mirror
there
ha
chuckled
the
man
as
if
his
eyes
had
chuckled
so
poorly
did
that
sound
represent
his
lordly
stature
and
look
of
high
spirit
ha
what
brings
them
all
to
my
neighbor
johnson
a
fair
quotient
quotient
repeated
jimmy
johnson
a
great
factor
hereabout
continued
the
man
bending
his
handsome
eyes
on
the
bay
captain
as
if
there
was
a
business
secret
between
them
and
peering
at
once
mischievously
and
nobly
he
makes
the
quotient
to
suit
he
leaves
the
suttle
large
and
never
stints
the
cloff
he
do
narry
a
feller
down
to
the
cloth
he
got
sir
assented
jimmy
dubiously
why
should
he
his
equation
is
simple
i
suppose
you
know
what
it
is
not
ezackly
answered
phoebus
pricking
up
his
ears
to
learn
well
it
is
force
and
class
sympathy
against
a
dead
quantity
laws
which
have
no
consignees
cattle
which
have
no
lawyer
and
no
tongue
rights
which
have
lapsed
by
their
assertion
being
suspended
till
demand
and
supply
like
a
pair
of
bulldogs
tear
what
is
left
to
pieces
armed
with
his
my
neighbor
johnson
offsets
everybody
serves
his
writ
the
first
and
makes
to
gentlemen
like
you
a
satisfactory
quotient
but
he
cuts
no
capers
with
isaac
and
jacob
cannon
i
expect
now
that
you
are
jacob
cannon
remarked
the
tawny
sailor
not
having
understood
a
word
of
what
preceded
if
that
the
case
i
glad
to
know
your
name
and
thank
you
for
givin
me
this
lift
by
a
bare
nod
just
intelligible
cannon
signified
that
the
guess
would
do
and
still
meditating
aloud
in
his
small
grand
way
continued
we
let
neighbor
johnson
and
his
somewhat
peculiar
make
such
commerce
as
suits
him
provided
he
studies
to
give
us
no
inconvenience
that
is
his
equation
with
his
quotient
we
have
no
concern
other
than
our
slight
interest
in
his
wastage
as
when
madame
cannon
rides
down
to
change
a
bill
and
leaves
an
order
for
supplies
rum
chiefly
i
believe
gentlemen
like
you
come
into
this
country
to
deal
replevin
or
what
not
and
we
say
to
you
all
tread
on
us
that
is
all
we
shall
not
look
into
your
parcels
nor
lie
awake
of
nights
to
hear
alarms
but
harm
isaac
and
jacob
cannon
one
and
facias
fi
fa
and
ejaculated
jimmy
cheerfully
i
hearn
it
before
looking
again
with
some
curiosity
at
his
companion
phoebus
saw
that
he
was
not
beyond
fifty
years
of
age
of
a
spare
lofty
figure
at
least
six
feet
four
high
sitting
straight
and
graceful
as
an
indian
his
clothes
his
countenance
and
features
both
stern
and
refined
every
feature
perfected
and
all
keen
without
being
hard
or
angular
and
yet
jimmy
did
not
like
him
there
seemed
to
have
been
made
a
commodore
or
a
general
some
one
designed
for
deeds
of
chivalry
and
great
philanthropy
and
yet
around
and
between
the
dancing
eyes
spider
lines
were
drawn
as
if
the
fine
high
brain
of
jacob
cannon
had
put
aside
matters
that
matched
it
and
meddled
with
nothing
that
ascended
higher
above
the
world
than
the
long
white
bridge
of
his
nose
his
sentiments
apparently
fell
no
further
towards
his
heart
than
that
his
brain
belonged
to
the
bridge
of
his
nose
another
meshach
milburn
by
smoke
concluded
jimmy
after
a
little
pause
phoebus
inquired
into
the
character
of
the
people
in
this
apparently
new
region
of
country
the
quotient
of
much
misplanting
and
lawyering
is
the
lands
on
the
nanticoke
spoke
the
apollo
the
piece
of
country
directly
before
us
in
the
rear
of
my
neighbor
johnson
was
an
old
indian
reservation
for
seventy
years
and
so
were
three
thousand
acres
to
our
right
on
broad
creek
the
indian
is
a
bad
factor
to
civilize
his
white
neighbors
he
does
not
know
the
luxury
of
the
law
that
grand
contrivance
to
make
the
equation
between
the
business
man
and
the
herd
ha
ha
cannon
chuckled
as
if
he
at
least
appreciated
the
law
and
turned
the
fine
horsy
bridge
of
his
nose
all
gray
with
dancing
eyelight
enjoyingly
upon
phoebus
the
indians
were
long
imposed
upon
and
when
they
went
away
at
the
brink
of
the
revolutionary
war
they
left
a
demoralized
white
race
and
others
who
moved
in
upon
the
deserted
lands
of
the
nanticokes
were
if
possible
more
indian
than
the
indians
this
peninsula
never
produced
a
great
indian
but
when
ebenezer
johnson
settled
on
broad
creek
it
possessed
a
greater
savage
than
tecumseh
he
took
what
he
wanted
and
appealed
to
nature
like
the
indian
he
stole
nothing
he
merely
took
it
he
served
with
anything
convenient
from
his
fists
to
a
blunderbuss

wondering
but
submissive
mankind
need
i
say
that
this
was
before
the
perfect
day
of
isaac
and
jacob
cannon
they
would
have
socked
it
to
him
i
reckon
jimmy
exclaimed
consonantly
jacob
cannon
gave
a
tender
smile
such
as
the
gray
horse
emits
at
the
prospect
of
oats
and
continued
such
was
the
multiplicand
to
make
the
future
race
here
too
raged
the
debate
between
penns
and
calverts
with
occasional
raids
and
broken
heads
and
a
noble
suit
in
chancery
of
fifty
years
till
no
man
title
was
known
and
instead
of
improving
their
lands
our
voluptuous
predecessors
improved
chiefly
their
opportunities
you
cut
sundry
cords
of
wood
and
hauled
it
to
the
landing
and
ebenezer
johnson
coolly
scowed
it
over
to
his
paradise
at
the
mouth
of
broad
creek
you
had
a
little
parcel
of
negroes
but
the
british
in
two
successive
wars
lay
in
the
river
mouth
and
beckoned
them
off
having
no
interest
in
any
certain
property
the
foresters
of
the
nanticoke
would
rather
trade
with
the
enemy
than
fight
for
foolish
ideas
and
so
this
region
was
more
than
half
tory
and
is
still
half
passive
the
other
half
predatory
to
neither
half
of
such
a
quotient
belongs
the
house
of
isaac
and
jacob
cannon
his
nostrils
swelled
a
trifle
with
military
spirit
and
he
raised
the
bridge
of
his
nose
delicately
turning
to
observe
his
instinctive
companion
if
it
any
harm
i
wo
ask
it
the
mariner
spoke
but
air
you
two
cannons
ary
kin
to
ole
patty
cannon
cannon
smiled
in
adam
all
sinned
there
we
may
have
been
connected
he
said
the
question
you
ask
may
one
day
be
actionable
sir
the
cannons
are
a
numerous
people
in
our
region
of
fair
substance
such
as
we
have
but
they
showed
nothing
to
vary
the
equation
of
subsistence
here
till
there
arose
the
mother
of
isaac
and
jacob
cannon
she
was
a
remarkable
woman
unassisted
she
procured
the
charter
for
cannon
ferry
and
made
the
port
settlement
of
that
name
by
the
importance
her
ferry
acquired
and
when
she
died
there
were
found
in
her
house
nine
hundred
dollars
in
silver
for
she
never
would
take
any
paper
money
the
earnings
of
that
sequestered
ferry
to
start
her
sons
on
their
career
she
knew
the
peculiar
character
of
some
of
her
neighbors
how
lightly
and
sat
upon
their
fears
or
consciences
but
she
kept
no
guard
except
her
own
good
gray
eyes
and
dauntless
heart
over
that
accumulating
pile
of
little
sixpences
for
there
was
but
one
spirit
as
bold
as
she
in
all
this
region
of
the
world
and
that
i
reckon
observed
jimmy
phoebus
was
ole
patty
cannon
herself
jacob
cannon
slightly
bowed
his
head
and
spoke
aloud
from
an
inner
communion
forgive
me
mother
that
i
make
the
comparison
thy
frugal
oil
that
burned
with
pure
and
lonely
widow
flame
at
cannon
ferry
window
the
traveller
hailed
with
comfort
in
his
heart
and
blessed
the
enterprise
but
to
compound
the
equation
another
unknown
quantity
of
female
force
arose
beside
my
mother
lamp
a
certain
young
cannon
distantly
of
our
stock
must
needs
go
see
the
world
and
he
returned
with
a
fair
demon
of
a
bride
and
settled
too
at
cannon
ferry
he
lived
to
see
the
wondrous
serpent
he
had
warmed
in
his
arms
and
died
they
say
of
the
sting
but
she
lived
on
and
shrinking
back
into
the
woods
to
a
little
farm
my
mother
sons
rented
to
her
she
lighted
there
a
many
a
traveller
has
pursued
who
never
returned
to
tell
with
ebenezer
johnson
progeny
and
her
own
siren
sisters
who
followed
madame
cannon
to
the
nanticoke
the
nucleus
of
a
settlement
began
and
has
existed
for
twenty
years
that
only
the
can
explore
that
my
arrand
jacob
cannon
quietly
remarked
jimmy
phoebus
a
pore
man
from
prencess
anne
if
you
took
me
for
a
you
did
me
as
pore
a
compliment
as
when
i
asked
if
you
was
patty
kin
but
i
have
got
just
one
gal
to
love
and
just
one
life
to
lose
if
god
takes
me
thar
i
to
johnson
jacob
cannon
turned
and
examined
his
companion
with
some
twinkling
care
but
showed
no
personal
concern
every
man
must
be
his
own
security
my
friend
till
he
can
find
a
bailsman
that
place
i
never
take
neither
the
debtor
nor
the
security
the
firm
of
isaac
and
jacob
cannon
allows
no
trespass
and
further
concern
themselves
not
but
we
are
at
the
nanticoke
i
obliged
to
you
for
the
lift
jacob
cannon
said
jimmy
springing
down
and
hope
you
may
never
find
it
inconvenient
to
have
let
such
a
pack
of
wolves
use
your

chapter
xxiii
twiford
island
some
piles
of
wood
and
an
old
wharf
were
at
the
and
a
little
scow
half
filled
with
water
and
with
only
a
broken
piece
of
paddle
in
it
was
the
only
boat
the
pungy
captain
could
find
the
merchant
buggy
was
soon
out
of
sight
and
the
wide
gray
nanticoke
several
hundred
yards
wide
and
made
wider
by
a
broad
river
that
flowed
into
it
through
low
bluffs
and
levels
immediately
opposite
was
receiving
the
strong
shadows
of
approaching
night
and
the
tide
was
running
up
it
violent
and
deep
long
lines
of
melancholy
woods
shut
both
these
rivers
in
an
osprey
suddenly
struck
the
surface
of
the
water
like
a
drowning
man
and
rose
as
if
it
had
escaped
from
some
demon
in
the
flood
the
silence
following
his
plunge
was
deeper
than
ever
till
a
goatsucker
noiselessly
making
his
zigzag
chase
cried
as
if
out
of
eternal
gloom
his
solemn
command
to
poor
will
those
notes
repeated
as
by
some
slave
ordering
his
brother
to
be
lashed
or
one
sympathetic
soul
in
perdition
made
the
to
another
misery
floated
on
the
evening
light
as
if
the
oars
of
charon
echoed
on
the
styx
and
broken
hearts
were
crossing
over
alone
unintimidated
but
not
altogether
comfortable
jimmy
phoebus
proceeded
to
bail
out
the
old
scow
and
wished
he
had
accepted
one
of
jack
wonnell
hats
to
do
the
task
and
when
he
had
finished
it
the
stars
and
clouds
were
manoeuvring
around
each
other
in
the
sky
with
the
clouds
the
more
aggressive
and
finally
some
drops
of
rain
punctured
the
long
bare
muscles
of
the
inflowing
tide
making
a
reticule
of
little
pittings
like
a
net
of
beads
on
drifting
women
tresses
as
night
advanced
a
puffing
something
ascended
the
broad
black
aisle
of
this
forest
river
and
slowly
the
norfolk
steamboat
rumbled
past
with
passengers
for
the
philadelphia
stage
then
silence
drew
a
sheet
of
fog
around
herself
and
passed
into
a
cold
torpor
of
repose
affected
only
by
the
waves
that
licked
the
shores
with
intermittent
thirst
the
waterman
regretting
a
little
that
he
had
not
taken
his
stand
at
vienna
where
human
assistance
might
have
been
procured
and
thinking
that
the
poison
airs
might
also
afflict
him
with
meshach
complaints
fought
sleep
away
till
midnight
straining
his
eyes
and
ears
ever
and
anon
for
signs
of
some
sail
but
nothing
drew
near
and
he
had
insensibly
closed
his
lids
and
might
have
soon
been
in
deep
sleep
but
that
he
suddenly
heard
between
his
dreams
and
this
world
something
like
a
little
baby
moaning
in
the
night
he
sat
up
in
the
damp
scow
where
he
had
been
lying
and
listened
with
all
his
senses
wide
open
and
once
again
the
cry
was
wafted
upon
the
river
zephyrs
and
before
it
died
away
the
sailor
paddle
was
in
the
water
and
his
frail
awkward
vessel
was
darting
across
the
tide
he
saw
in
the
black
night
what
none
but
a
sailor
eyes
would
have
seen
a
thing
not
visible
but
divined
coming
along
on
the
bosom
of
the
river
and
his
ears
saw
it
the
clearer
as
that
little
cry
continued
now
stopped
now
stifled
now
rising
now
nearly
piercing
and
then
there
was
a
growl
momentary
and
loud
and
a
rattle
as
of
feet
over
wood
and
a
stroke
or
thud
or
heavy
concussion
and
then
a
white
thing
rose
up
against
the
universal
ink
and
rushed
on
the
little
scow
sucking
water
as
it
came
the
under
full
sail
phoebus
had
paddled
for
the
opposite
shore
of
the
river
to
prevent
the
object
of
his
quest
escaping
up
the
northwest
fork
yet
to
be
in
its
path
if
it
beat
up
the
main
fork
and
by
a
piece
of
instinctive
calculation
he
had
run
nearly
under
the
bows
ahoy
there
cried
jimmy
standing
up
in
his
tipsy
little
skiff
ahoy
the
dennis
i
aboard
and
with
this
the
paddle
still
in
his
hand
and
his
knees
and
feet
nearly
sentient
in
their
providence
of
uses
the
sailor
threw
himself
upon
the
low
gunwale
and
let
it
glide
through
his
palms
till
he
could
see
the
man
at
the
helm
there
was
no
light
to
be
called
so
but
the
helmsman
was
yet
perceived
by
the
sailor
experienced
eyes
and
he
grappled
the
gunwale
firmer
and
preparing
to
swing
himself
on
board
shouted
hoarsely
you
levin
dennis
i
see
you
by
smoke
you
know
jimmy
phoebus
is
your
friend
an
come
out
of
this
pangymonum
an
stop
of
your
mother
heart
oh
i
see
you
my
son
if
he
did
see
levin
dennis
levin
did
not
see
jimmy
phoebus
nor
apparently
hear
him
but
stood
motionless
at
the
helm
as
a
frozen
man
looking
straight
on
in
the
night
the
rigging
made
a
little
flapping
the
rudder
creaked
on
its
hooks
but
every
human
sound
was
still
as
the
grave
now
and
the
boy
at
the
helm
seemed
petrified
and
deaf
and
blind
the
pungy
captain
temper
rose
his
superstition
not
being
equal
to
that
of
most
people
and
he
cried
again
you
a
disgrace
to
the
woman
that
bore
you
hell
for
your
pore
tender
body
an
soul
heave
ahoy
an
let
drop
that
gaff
an
take
me
aboard
levin
still
silent
and
passive
as
a
stone
the
youthful
figure
at
the
helm
did
not
seem
to
breathe
and
the
cut
the
water
like
a
a
flash
of
bright
fire
lighted
up
the
vessel
side
a
loud
rang
out
and
the
sailor
hands
loosened
from
the
gunwale
and
clutched
at
the
air
and
he
felt
the
black
night
fall
on
him
as
if
he
had
pulled
down
its
ebony
columns
upon
his
head
he
knew
no
more
for
hours
till
he
felt
himself
lying
in
cold
water
and
saw
the
gray
morning
coming
through
over
his
head
he
had
a
thirsty
feeling
and
pain
somewhere
and
for
a
few
minutes
did
not
move
but
lay
there
on
his
shoulder
holding
to
something
and
guessing
what
it
might
be
and
where
he
might
be
making
his
bed
in
this
chilly
autumn
dawn
his
hand
was
clutching
the
plank
of
the
old
scow
and
was
so
stiff
he
could
not
for
some
time
open
it
the
scow
was
aground
upon
a
marshy
shore
in
which
some
large
trees
grew
and
were
the
fringes
of
a
woods
that
deepened
farther
back
by
smoke
muttered
jimmy
if
yer
ai
but
i
reckon
i
ai
dead
nohow
with
this
he
lifted
the
other
hand
that
had
been
stretched
beneath
his
head
and
was
also
numb
with
cramp
and
cold
and
it
was
full
of
blood
well
said
jimmy
that
feller
did
hit
me
but
if
he
lend
me
his
pistol
i
fire
a
straighter
slug
than
i
wonder
where
it
is
feeling
around
his
head
the
captain
came
to
a
raw
spot
the
touch
of
which
gave
him
acute
pain
and
made
the
blood
flow
freshly
as
he
withdrew
his
hand
and
he
could
just
speak
the
words
water
or
i
when
he
swooned
away
the
sun
was
up
and
shining
cheerily
in
the
as
phoebus
who
was
its
recovered
his
senses
again
and
he
bathed
his
face
still
lying
down
and
tore
a
piece
of
his
raiment
off
for
a
bandage
and
by
the
mirror
of
a
still
green
pool
of
water
examined
his
wound
which
was
in
the
fleshy
part
of
his
cheek
a
little
groove
or
gutter
now
choked
with
almost
dried
blood
where
the
ball
had
ploughed
a
line
it
had
probably
struck
a
bone
but
had
not
broken
it
and
this
had
stunned
him
i
was
so
ugly
before
that
ellenory
would
more
than
half
look
at
me
jimmy
mused
an
now
i
she
never
kiss
that
air
cheek
he
then
bandaged
his
cheek
roughly
sitting
up
and
took
a
survey
of
the
scenery
the
river
was
here
a
full
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
on
the
opposite
shore
bluffy
and
in
places
bold
but
on
the
side
where
phoebus
had
drifted
with
the
tide
clutching
his
old
scow
with
mortal
grip
there
extended
a
point
of
level
woods
and
marsh
or
cripple
as
if
by
the
action
of
some
and
this
low
ground
appeared
to
have
a
considerable
area
and
was
nowhere
tilled
or
fenced
or
gave
any
signs
of
being
visited
but
the
opposite
or
northern
shore
was
quite
otherwise
there
the
river
had
a
wide
bend
or
hollow
to
receive
two
considerable
creeks
and
changed
its
course
almost
abruptly
from
west
to
southwest
giving
a
grand
view
of
its
wide
bosom
for
the
distance
of
more
than
two
miles
into
maryland
and
the
prospect
was
closed
in
that
direction
by
a
something
like
lime
or
shell
piles
standing
against
the
background
of
pale
blue
woods
and
bluffs
right
opposite
the
spot
where
phoebus
had
been
stranded
a
cleared
farm
came
out
to
the
nanticoke
affording
a
front
of
only
a
single
field
on
the
crest
of
a
considerable
elevations
looking
magnified
here
where
nature
is
so
level
and
at
one
end
of
this
field
which
was
planted
in
corn
that
was
now
clinging
dry
to
the
naked
stalks
an
old
lane
descended
to
a
wharf
of
a
stumpy
square
form
and
almost
at
the
other
or
western
end
of
the
clearing
stood
a
respectable
of
considerable
age
with
a
hipped
roof
and
three
queer
dormer
windows
slipping
down
the
steeper
half
below
and
two
chimneys
not
built
outside
of
the
house
as
was
the
general
fashion
but
naturally
rising
out
of
the
old
gables
all
between
the
gables
was
built
of
wood
a
porch
of
one
story
occupied
nearly
half
the
centre
of
that
side
of
the
house
facing
the
river
and
to
the
right
against
the
house
and
behind
it
were
kitchen
and
other
low
tenements
in
picturesque
medley
while
to
the
left
crouched
an
old
low
building
on
the
water
edge
looking
like
a
or
a
small
warehouse
the
road
from
the
wharf
and
lane
passed
along
a
beach
and
partly
through
the
river
water
to
enter
a
gate
between
this
shed
and
the
dwelling
and
from
the
garden
or
lawn
on
the
bluff
before
the
latter
arose
two
tall
and
elegant
trees
a
and
a
stalwart
mulberry
now
i
never
been
by
this
place
before
jimmy
phoebus
muttered
but
by
smoke
yon
house
looks
to
me
like
betty
twiford
wharf
an
to
save
my
life
i
ca
help
thinkin
yon
white
spots
down
this
side
of
the
river
air
sharptown
if
that
the
case
which
state
am
i
in
he
rose
to
his
feet
bailed
the
scow
which
was
nearly
full
of
water
and
began
to
paddle
along
the
shore
and
seeing
something
white
he
landed
and
parted
the
bushes
and
found
it
to
be
a
stone
of
a
bluish
marble
bearing
on
one
side
the
letter
m
and
on
the
other
the
letter

and
a
royal
crown
was
also
carved
upon
it
yer

phoebus
exclaimed
now
see
the
rascality
o
them
kidnappers
yon
house
i
know
is
twiford
because
it
on
the
but
i
ashamed
to
say
it
a
leetle
in
maryland
and
that
lane
coming
down
to
the
wharf
is
my
way
to
joe
johnson
pangymonum
at
his
a
sound
as
of
some
one
singing
seemed
to
come
from
the
woods
near
by
and
phoebus
listening
concluded
that
it
was
farther
along
the
water
so
he
paddled
softly
forward
till
a
small
cove
or
pool
led
up
into
the
swamp
and
its
shores
nowhere
offered
a
dry
landing
yet
there
were
recent
deeply
trodden
in
the
bog
and
disclosed
up
the
slope
into
the
woods
and
from
their
direction
seemed
to
come
the
mysterious
chanting
my
head
bloody
and
i
wet
as
a
so
i
reckon
i
ai
afraid
of
gittin
a
little
muddy
and
with
this
the
navigator
stepped
from
the
scow
in
swamp
nearly
to
his
middle
and
pulled
himself
up
the
slope
by
main
strength
i
believe
my
soul
this
yer
is
a
island
jimmy
remarked
a
island
surrounded
with
mud
that
wuss
to
git
to
than
a
water
island
the
tall
trees
increased
in
size
as
he
went
on
and
entered
a
noble
grove
of
pines
through
whose
roar
like
an
organ
accompanied
by
a
human
voice
the
singing
was
heard
nearer
and
nearer
and
following
the
track
of
previous
feet
which
had
almost
made
a
path
phoebus
came
to
a
space
where
an
axe
had
laid
the
smaller
bushes
low
around
a
large
loblolly
pine
that
spread
its
branches
like
a
roof
only
a
few
feet
from
the
ground
and
there
fastened
by
a
chain
to
the
trunk
which
allowed
her
to
go
around
and
around
the
tree
and
tread
a
nearly
bare
place
in
the
pine
droppings
or
shats
sat
a
black
woman
singing
in
a
long
weary
wail
jimmy
listened
to
a
few
lines
de
woun
dy
han
have
made
in
dis
weak
helpless
soul
till
mercy
wid
its
mighty
aid
to
make
me
whole
yes
lord
to
make
me
whole
a
little
negro
child
perhaps
three
years
old
was
lying
asleep
on
the
ground
at
the
woman
feet
in
an
old
tattered
gray
blanket
that
might
have
been
discarded
from
a
stable
near
the
child
was
a
wooden
box
in
which
were
a
coarse
loaf
of
and
some
strips
of
bacon
and
a
wooden
trough
hollowed
out
of
a
log
contained
water
the
woman
face
was
scratched
and
bruised
and
as
she
came
to
some
dental
sounds
in
her
chant
her
teeth
were
revealed
with
several
freshly
missing
in
front
and
her
lips
were
swollen
and
the
gums
blistered
and
raw
she
glanced
up
as
phoebus
came
in
sight
looked
at
him
a
minute
in
blank
curiosity
as
if
she
did
not
know
what
kind
of
animal
he
was
and
then
continued
her
song
wearily
as
if
she
had
been
singing
it
for
days
and
her
mind
had
gone
into
it
and
was
out
of
her
control
as
she
moved
her
feet
from
time
to
time
the
chain
rattled
upon
her
ankles
well
said
jimmy
if
this
ai
pangymonum
i
reckon
i
find
it
at
johnson
git
up
thar
gal
an
let
me
see
what
ails
you
the
woman
rose
mechanically
still
singing
in
the
shrill
cracked
weary
drone
and
as
she
rose
the
baby
awoke
and
began
to
cry
and
she
stooped
and
took
it
up
and
patting
it
with
her
hands
sang
on
as
if
she
would
fall
asleep
singing
but
could
not
the
chain
strong
and
rusty
had
been
very
recently
welded
to
her
feet
by
a
blacksmith
the
fresh
rivet
attested
that
and
there
were
also
pieces
of
charcoal
in
the
pine
strewings
as
if
fire
had
been
brought
there
for
smith
uses
jimmy
phoebus
took
hold
of
the
chain
and
examined
it
link
by
link
till
it
depended
from
a
powerful
staple
driven
to
the
heart
of
the
though
rusty
it
was
perfect
in
every
part
and
the
condition
of
the
staple
showed
that
it
was
permanently
retained
in
its
position
as
if
to
secure
various
and
successive
persons
while
the
staple
itself
had
been
driven
above
the
reach
of
the
hands
as
by
a
man
standing
on
some
platform
or
on
another
shoulders
phoebus
took
the
chain
in
his
short
powerful
arms
and
giving
a
little
run
from
the
root
of
the
tree
threw
all
the
strength
of
his
compact
heavy
body
into
a
jerk
and
let
his
weight
fall
upon
it
but
did
not
produce
the
slightest
impression
there
jess
two
people
can
unfasten
this
chain
exclaimed
jimmy
blowing
hard
and
kneading
his
palms
after
two
such
exertions
one
of
em
a
blacksmith
and
a
woodchopper
gal
how
did
you
git
yer
the
woman
a
young
and
once
comely
person
of
about
years
of
age
sang
on
a
moment
as
if
she
did
not
understand
the
question
till
phoebus
repeated
it
with
a
kinder
tone
pore

a
second
an
bloody
vultures

nigh
by
speak
mary
the
universal
name
seemed
timely
to
this
woman
she
stopped
her
chanting
and
burst
into
tears
my
husband
brought
me
here
she
said
between
her
long
sobs
he
sold
me
i
give
him
everything
i
had
and
loved
him
too
and
he
sold
me

way
mary
you
do
talk
like

belong
to
philadelphia
i
was
a
free
woman
and
a
widow
my
husband
left
me
a
little
money
and
a
little
house
and
this
child
another
man
come
and
courted
me
a
mulatto
man
almost
as
white
as
you
he
told
me
he
had
a
farm
in
delaware
and
wanted
me
to
be
his
wife
he
promised
me
so
much
and
was
so
anxious
about
it
that
i
listened
to
him
oh
he
was
a
beautiful
talker
and
i
was
lonesome
and
wanted
love
i
let
him
sell
my
house
and
give
him
the
money
and
started
a
week
ago
to
come
to
my
new
home
oh
he
did
deceive
me
so
he
said
he
loved
me
dearly
she
began
to
cry
again
and
her
mind
seemed
to
wander
for
the
next
sentence
was
disconnected
jimmy
took
the
baby
in
his
arms
and
kissed
it
without
any
scruples
and
the
child
large
black
eyes
looked
into
his
as
if
he
might
be
its
own
father
while
he
dandled
it
tenderly
the
foxes
has
come
an
barked
at
me
two
nights
said
the
woman
they
wanted
the
bacon
i
the
has
crawled
around
here
in
the
daytime
and
the
buzzards
flew
right
down
before
me
and
looked
up
as
if
they
thought
i
ought
to
be
dead
but
i
was
afraid
that
man
i
give
my
love
to
was
so
much
worse
than
them
that
i
just
sung
and
let
them
look
at
me
you
say
he
sold
you
mary
the
woman
rubbed
her
weary
eyes
and
slowly
recollected
where
she
had
left
off
we
moved
our
things
on
a
vessel
to
delaware
and
come
up
a
creek
to
a
little
town
in
the
marshes
and
there
we
started
for
my
husband
farm
he
said
we
had
come
to
it
in
the
night
i
could
tell
but
i
saw
a
house
in
the
woods
and
was
so
tired
i
went
to
sleep
with
my
baby
there
and
in
the
night
i
found
men
in
the
room
and
one
of
them
a
white
man
was
tying
my
feet
a
crow
cawed
with
a
sound
of
awe
in
the
pine
tops
and
squirrels
were
running
tamely
all
round
about
as
she
hesitated
i
thought
then
of
the
kidnappers
of
delaware
for
i
had
heard
about
them
and
i
jumped
out
of
bed
and
fought
for
my
life
they
knocked
me
down
and
the
rope
around
my
feet
tripped
me
up
but
i
fought
with
my
teeth
after
my
hands
was
tied
too
and
i
bit
that
white
man
knees
and
then
he
picked
up
a
or
something
of
iron
and
knocked
my
teeth
out
my
last
hope
was
almost
gone
when
i
saw
my
husband
coming
in
and
i
cried
to
him
me
save
me
darling
he
had
a
rope
in
his
hand
and
before
i
could
understand
it
he
had
slipped
it
over
my
neck
and
choked
me
your
own
husband
i
ca
believe
it
to
save
my
life
i
did
believe
it
neither
till
i
heard
him
say
when
they
loosened
the
slipknot
that
had
strangled
me
the
voice
was
his
i
had
trusted
so
much
i
never
could
forget
it
he
said
took
down
every
mole
and
spot
on
her
body
and
can
swear
to
em
for
i
learned
by
heart
and
you
wo
have
no
trouble
her
as
she
testify
the
imp
of
pangymonum
jimmy
cried
he
had
married
you
to
note
down
your
marks
and
by
em
swear
you
to
be
a
slave
the
white
man
tried
to
sell
me
to
a
farmer
and
then
i
told
what
i
had
heard
them
say
he
believed
me
and
told
them
the
mayor
of
philadelphia
had
a
reward
out
for
them
for
kidnappin
free
people
already
then
they
talked
together
a
little
scared
they
was
and
tied
me
again
and
brought
me
on
a
cart
through
the
woods
to
the
river
and
fetched
me
here
and
chained
me
and
told
me
if
i
ever
said
i
was
free
to
another
man
they
meant
to
sell
my
baby
and
to
drown
me
in
the
river
she
finished
with
a
chilly
tremor
and
a
low
wail
like
an
infant
but
the
sailor
passed
her
baby
into
her
arms
to
engage
her
and
said
the
lord
is
still
of
his
sparrows
or
i
would
have
been
on
this
arrand
by
smoke
to
drift
yer
hangin
senseless
to
that
ole
scow
must
have
been
to
save
you
mary
this
is
a
island
where
they
chains
up
property
i
reckon
that
is
bein
follered
up
too
close
time
very
precious
mary
but
i
got
a
sailor
knife
yer
an
stay
to
cut
the
staple
out
o
this
ole
pine
if
they
come
an
kill
me
you
take
an
wash
my
face
off
outen
that
while
i
bite
a
bit
of
the
bacon
he
took
the
child
again
and
amused
it
while
the
woman
carefully
cleaned
his
wound
and
rebandaged
it
so
that
he
could
breathe
and
see
and
eat
though
the
cotton
folds
wrapped
in
much
of
his
face
like
a
mask
he
then
examined
the
chain
again
especially
where
it
was
rivetted
at
the
feet
and
lifted
a
large
iron
ball
weighing
several
pounds
which
was
also
affixed
to
her
ankle
so
that
she
could
not
climb
the
tree
her
ankle
he
found
blistered
by
the
rivet
being
smithed
so
barbarously
close
to
the
flesh
do
leave
me
oh
do
leave
me
here
to
die
the
woman
pleaded
as
he
started
into
the
woods
i
stay
by
you
an
we
die
together
if
we
must
but
it
not
my
idee
to
die
at
all
mary
i
goin
to
bring
that
air
scow
ashore
while
i
cut
a
hickory
if
i
can
find
one
to
break
this
yer
chain
plunging
again
into
the
mud
nearly
to
his
waist
phoebus
pulled
the
scow
up
into
the
woods
and
had
barely
concealed
himself
when
he
saw
come
out
of
the
creek
below
twiford
house
a
like
the
and
stand
towards
the
island
in
the
cripple
the
tide
agin
em
an
they
must
make
a
tack
to
get
yer
jimmy
muttered
but
i
afraid
this
knife
will
have
to
go
to
the
heart
of
some
son
of
pangymonum
in
ten
minutes
or
ellenory
dennis
never
agin
be
pestered
by
her
ugly
lover
he
was
seized
with
a
certain
frenzy
of
strength
and
discernment
at
the
danger
he
was
in
and
as
he
carried
the
scow
onward
and
across
the
woodland
island
heavy
as
it
was
he
also
noted
a
single
small
hickory
tree
on
that
farther
margin
and
threw
himself
against
it
and
bent
it
down
and
plunged
his
knife
into
the
straining
fibres
so
that
it
crackled
and
splintered
in
his
hand
he
leaped
to
the
tree
and
scaled
it
as
he
had
often
climbed
a
mast
and
he
thrust
the
sapling
under
the
staple
trimming
the
point
down
with
the
knife
as
he
clutched
the
tree
by
his
knees
and
then
catching
the
young
hickory
like
a
lever
he
dropped
down
the
pine
trunk
and
got
his
shoulder
under
the
sapling
and
brought
the
weight
of
his
body
desperately
against
it
the
staple
bent
upward
in
the
tree
but
did
not
loosen
at
that
instant
the
scraping
of
a
boat
upon
the
mud
was
heard
and
the
black
woman
fell
upon
her
knees
pray
but
do
it
soft
jimmy
whispered
an
not
a
cry
from
the
child
or
there
be
a
murder
he
had
rapidly
trimmed
the
hickory
stem
of
its
branches
while
he
spoke
so
that
it
could
penetrate
the
arborage
of
the
tree
from
above
and
climbing
higher
like
a
cat
he
worked
the
point
of
the
lever
downwards
into
the
now
crooked
staple
and
threw
himself
out
of
the
tree
against
the
sapling
which
bent
like
a
bow
nearly
double
but
would
not
break
and
as
the
staple
yielded
and
flew
out
the
chain
and
the
deliverer
fell
together
on
the
soft
pine
litter
hark
exclaimed
a
voice
through
the
woods
what
was
it
asked
another
voice
come
phoebus
murmured
and
gathered
together
the
woman
the
child
and
the
chain
and
ball
and
stepped
long
and
silent
as
a
leaps
through
the
pines
carrying
the
whole
burden
on
his
shoulders
he
sat
them
in
the
scow
which
sank
to
the
edges
and
covered
by
a
protruding
point
of
woods
pushed
off
into
the
deep
river
yet
guiding
the
frail
vessel
in
to
the
sides
of
the
stream
away
from
the
influence
of
the
tide
as
the
scow
turned
the
first
crease
or
elbow
in
the
river
it
began
to
sink
if
you
make
a
sound
you
are
a
slave
fur
life
whispered
the
waterman
as
he
slipped
overboard
and
began
to
swim
with
his
hand
upon
the
stern
as
he
did
this
straining
every
muscle
of
his
countenance
to
keep
afloat
the
wound
in
his
cheek
began
to
bleed
again
and
he
felt
his
strength
going
down
down
he
began
to
settle
till
the
water
reached
his
nostrils
and
the
woman
heard
him
sigh
as
he
was
sinking
i
do
it
an
die
agin
fur
ellenory
god
bless
her
the
scow
now
full
of
water
turned
upside
down
and
threw
mother
and
child
into
the
stream
and
the
child
was
gone
beneath
the
surface
before
the
woman
could
catch
herself
upon
a
sunken
branch
of
an
imbedded
tree
and
as
she
gasped
there
the
body
of
the
pungy
captain
swept
past
her
and
she
caught
him
by
the
hair
and
he
clutched
her
with
the
drowning
instinct
and
down
they
went
together
like
husband
and
wife
in
nature
contempt
of
distinctions
between
living
worms
they
went
down
to
the
very
bottom
but
not
to
drown
for
the
old
tree
having
fallen
where
it
grew
in
other
years
was
sustained
upon
its
limbs
and
made
an
invisible
yet
sure
pathway
to
the
shore
the
long
chain
and
the
iron
ball
fettered
to
the
colored
woman
foot
however
deprived
her
for
a
few
moments
of
all
power
to
step
along
the
slippery
submerged
trunk
and
with
her
soul
full
of
agony
for
her
child
which
she
no
longer
saw
she
was
about
to
let
go
of
her
deliverer
body
and
throw
herself
also
into
the
river
to
die
with
them
when
the
old
scow
having
emptied
itself
of
the
water
reappeared
at
the
surface
and
struck
the
woman
a
buoyant
blow
that
altered
the
course
of
her
thought
pore
brave
man
the
woman
gasped
he
got
a
wife
maybe
he
said
bless
her
an
he
give
his
life
for
a
poor
creature
like
me
god
has
took
my
baby
i
ca
do
nothing
for
it
now
but
maybe
i
can
save
this
man
life
before
i
die
indifferent
to
her
personal
fate
she
drew
intelligence
from
her
spirit
of
sacrifice
which
is
the
only
thing
better
than
learning
she
pushed
the
scow
down
and
under
phoebus
with
her
remaining
hand
till
it
relieved
her
of
a
portion
of
the
weight
of
his
body
and
rose
up
the
sailor
form
and
animating
her
generous
purpose
with
the
honest
and
happy
smile
he
wore
upon
his
face
even
in
the
vestibule
of
the
eternal
palace
then
gathering
the
long
meshes
of
the
iron
chain
up
from
its
termination
at
her
feet
she
threw
the
longer
portion
of
it
into
the
scow
so
that
it
no
longer
became
entangled
in
the
and
knots
below
and
she
could
lift
also
the
iron
ball
sufficiently
to
glide
her
feet
along
the
tree
with
pain
and
difficulty
lessened
by
she
pushed
the
scow
and
the
body
to
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
feeling
around
its
old
roots
for
further
support
the
terrapins
arose
and
swam
around
her
disturbed
in
their
possessions
but
she
feared
no
reptiles
any
more
since
death
the
mighty
crocodile
had
eaten
the
babe
that
she
had
nursed
but
this
morning
she
had
intelligent
remembrance
enough
to
think
of
all
the
precautions
her
deliverer
had
taken
and
when
she
had
dragged
his
body
on
the
shore
into
the
dense
scrubby
woods
she
also
drew
out
the
little
scow
and
heaped
some
dead
brush
upon
it
and
had
scarcely
concealed
herself
when
she
heard
voices
from
the
river
and
the
report
of
a
sail
swung
around
upon
its
boom
and
of
feet
upon
a
deck
the
voices
said
if
she
got
off
to
delaware
joe
johnson
wo
have
long
to
stay
on
his
visit
for
all
the
beaks
will
gather
fur
him
an
be
started
by
john
m
clayton
i
sorry
fur
joe
answered
another
voice
he
hoped
to
make
one
more
big
scoop
this
trip
an
quit
the
corners
fur
good
let
us
sail
by
ole
ebenezer
johnson
roost
at
broad
creek
mouth
peep
up
both
forks
of
the
river
said
the
other
voice
receding
only
a
mile
and
a
half
if
we
discover
nothin
we
run
down
the
river
and
inquire
at
the
landings
as
fur
as
vienny
the
colored
woman
now
worked
with
all
her
strength
to
revive
the
insensible
sailor
rolling
him
rubbing
his
body
till
her
elbows
seemed
almost
to
be
dropping
off
and
then
rubbing
his
great
broad
breast
with
her
head
and
face
and
neck
she
breathed
into
his
mouth
the
breath
heaven
vouchsafed
to
hagar
as
bountifully
as
to
sarah
and
wringing
out
portions
of
her
garments
and
hanging
them
at
sunny
exposures
to
dry
she
substituted
them
in
her
exhausted
intervals
for
the
wet
clothing
of
the
man
and
as
she
worked
with
a
hollow
desolate
heart
she
sobbed
lord
gi
me
this
man
life
o
lord
that
took
my
chile
i
will
have
this
life
back
crying
and
weeping
fainting
and
laboring
the
moments
it
seemed
the
very
hours
ran
by
and
still
he
did
not
waken
and
still
with
all
that
noble
strength
that
makes
the
fields
of
white
men
grow
and
blossom
under
the
negro
unthanked
toil
the
widow
and
childless
one
fought
on
for
this
cold
lump
of
brother
nature
he
warmed
he
breathed
he
groaned
he
spoke
his
voice
was
like
a
happy
sigh
as
of
one
disturbed
near
the
end
of
a
comforting
morning
nap
in
summer
you
thar
mary
he
stared
around
with
difficulty
his
wounded
face
now
clotted
and
stained
with
blood
and
his
eyes
next
looked
an
inquiry
so
kind
and
apprehensive
that
she
answered
it
to
save
him
breath
baby
drowned
god
does
best
he
reached
his
hand
to
hers
she
was
almost
naked
to
the
waist
having
sacrificed
all
she
had
the
greatest
of
which
was
modesty
to
bring
back
that
life
in
him
which
came
naked
and
unashamed
into
the
world
and
he
put
his
little
strength
into
the
grasp
mary
he
exhaled
why
did
you
ketch
the
baby
and
leave
me
go
oh
dearly
as
i
loved
it
the
woman
answered
i
glad
you
come
up
under
my
hands
instead
you
can
do
good
you
a
white
man
baby
would
have
only
been
a
poor
slave
or
a
free
negro
nobody
would
care
for
i
mean
to
do
good
if
the
lord
lets
me

chapter

old
chimneys
the
day
was
far
advanced
when
jimmy
phoebus
was
strong
enough
to
rise
and
walk
and
leave
the
refuge
in
the
woods
he
advised
the
colored
woman
to
crawl
through
the
along
the
margin
while
he
paddled
in
the
old
scow
in
the
shadow
of
the
forest
which
now
lay
strong
upon
the
river
breast
at
the
distance
of
about
a
mile
broad
creek
like
a
tributary
river
flowed
into
the
nanticoke
from
the
east
fully
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
and
half
a
mile
up
this
stream
an
old
low
extended
house
faced
the
river
and
seemed
to
grin
out
of
its
broken
ribs
and
hollow
like
a
traitor
skull
discolored
upon
a
gibbet
it
was
falling
to
pieces
and
along
its
a
line
of
crows
balanced
and
croaked
as
if
they
had
fine
stories
to
tell
and
weird
opinions
to
pass
upon
the
former
inhabitants
of
the
tenement
there
i
have
hearn
tell
said
jimmy
as
he
drew
in
to
the
bank
and
took
the
woman
into
the
scow
and
began
to
tow
her
along

and
patty

deep
as
death
an
the
grave
phoebus
looked
at
the
woman
sitting
in
the
scow
and
he
saw
that
she
was
fast
asleep
his
tale
having
no
power
to
startle
her
senses
now
by
every
infliction
i
must
git
that
ball
an
chain
off
the
sailor
said
but
iron
in
these
ole
sandy
parts
is
scarce
as
gold
he
lifted
her
out
of
the
scow
and
laid
her
in
the
shade
and
began
to
explore
the
old
house
to
his
joy
he
found
the
iron
crane
still
hanging
in
the
chimney
and
signs
of
recent
fire
these
yer
ole
cranes
was
valleyble
once
jimmy
said
an
in
the
wills
they
left

their
children
like

had
over

bilin
pots

broke
a
woman
heart
to
git
a
little
kittle

an
the
gal
was
jest
pestered
with
beaux
but
by
smoke
we
iron
now
in
amerikey
kittles
is
cheap
and
that
why
this
crane
is
left
by
robbers
an
gypsies
after
they
used
it
he
twisted
the
crane
out
of
the
bricks
on
which
it
was
hinged
and
some
of
the
mantel
jamb
fell
down
hallo
cried
jimmy

pulled
a
few
bricks
out
of
the
jamb
and
raked
the
hollow
space
inside
with
his
hand
and
brought
forth
a
steel
purse
of
english
manufacture
filled
with
shillings
at
one
end
and
fifteen
golden
guineas
at
the
other
they
rolled
out
through
the
decayed
filigree
rusted
probably
by
the
rain
percolating
through
the
chimney
and
the
purse
crumbled
to
in
his
hand
lord

said
the

i
ai
partickler

he
continued
as
an
owl
fluttered
out
and
hopped
up

ruined
stairway

country
out
to

admiral
cockburn
but
the
war
was
done
when
this
money
was
coined
whose
was

he
removed
more
carefully
some
of
the
bricks
to
put
his
hand
in
the
hollow
depository
left
there
and
feeling
around
and
higher
up
brought
out
the
bronze
hilt
of
a
sword
on
which
was
a
name
who
would
have
thought
this
was
a

and
as
he
left
the
rotting
old
house
a
crash
and
a
cloud
of
smoke
rose
up
behind
him
and
the
chimney
fell
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
with
the
crane
sharp
point
and
long
leverage
the
pungy
captain
succeeded
after
tedious
efforts
in
breaking
the
links
of
the
chain
and
also
in
removing
the
linked
from
the
woman
foot
but
he
could
not
remove
the
iron
band
and
link
around
her
ankle

fell
on
the
ground
and
kissed
his

and
bathed

with
her
tears
i
do
have
faith
master
she
said
faith
enough
to
be
your
slave
i
cry
a
little
too
said
jimmy
twitching
his
eyes
as
the
woman
disappeared
in
the
forest
if
i
knowed
how
to
do
it
but
by
smoke
the
wind
on
the
bay
dried
up
my
tear
ponds
i
bury
these
curiosities
right
yer
with
this
chain
and
ball
and
put
some
old
bricks
around
em
outen
the
chimney
they
come
from
he
dug
a
hole
with
his
knife
carefully
cutting
out
a
piece
of
the
sod
and
restoring
it
over
the
buried
articles
and
after
notching
some
trees
to
mark
the
place
he
pushed
in
the
scow
again
into
broad
creek
and
descended
the
nanticoke
on
the
falling
tide
to
twiford
wharf
dragging
the
scow
up
the
bed
of
a
creek
to
conceal
it
he
discovered
another
boundary
stone
a
beach
led
under
the
cover
of
a
sandy
bluff
to
the
river
gate
of
twiford
comfortable
house
and
he
boldly
entered
the
lane
and
lawn
saying
to
himself
i
reckon
a
feller
can
ask
to
buy
one
squar
meal
a
day
in
a
free
country
fur
i
hungry
even
in
that
day
the
house
was
probably
seventy
years
old
roofed
by
an
artistic
shingler
in
lines
like
old
the
short
roofs
over
the
three
pretty
dormers
like
laced
the
in
small
checkers
of
dark
glass
the
roof
capacious
as
an
armadillo
back
or
but
half
of
it
was
almost
as
straight
as
the
walls
and
the
small
foreign
bricks
in
the
gables
glazed
black
and
alternately
were
laid
by
conscientious
workmen
and
bade
fair
to
stand
another
hundred
years
as
they
smoked
their
tidy
chimney
pipes
from
hearty
stomachs
of
fireplaces
below
standing
beneath
the
tree
at
the
the
sailor
beheld
an
extensive
prospect
of
the
river
nanticoke
bending
in
a
beautiful
curve
like
the
rim
of
a
silver
salver
towards
the
south
the
blue
perspective
of
the
surrounding
woods
fading
into
the
azure
bluffs
on
the
farther
shore
where
as
he
now
identified
it
the
hamlet
of
sharptown
assumed
the
mystery
and
similitude
of
a
city
by
the
enchantment
of
distance
a
large
brig
was
riding
up
the
river
under
the
afternoon
breeze
carrying
the
english
flag
at
her
spanker
the
flying
in
lines
like
hyads
astray
flickered
on
the
salver
of
the
river
like
some
fishermen
distantly
appeared
human
yet
nearly
stationary
as
if
to
enliven
a
dream
and
the
bees
in
a
row
of
hives
kept
murmuring
near
by
increasing
the
restful
sense
in
the
heart
and
the
ears
why
can
not
human
natur
be
happy
yer
pertickler
with
its
gal
some
one
like
ellenory
phoebus
thought
why
must
it
git
cruel
an
desperate
for
money
lookin
out
on
this
dancin
water
an
want
to
turn
this
trance
into
a
pangymonum
he
crossed
the
lane
to
a
squatty
old
structure
of
brick
by
the
and
peeped
in
a
still
by
smoke
he
said
if
it
ai
apple
brandy
may
i
forgit
my
compass
no
it
peach
brandy
well
anyway
it
hot
enough
an
this
i
is
what
started
the
pangymonum
he
took
a
stout
drink
and
it
revived
his
weakened
system
and
he
bathed
his
head
in
its
strong
alcohol
he
then
returned
to
the
lawn
and
walked
around
the
house
peeping
into
the
lower
rooms
of
which
there
were
two
in
the
main
building
the
kitchen
being
an
appendage
but
saw
nobody
the
porch
in
the
rear
extended
the
full
width
of
the
house
unlike
the
smaller
shed
in
front
which
only
covered
two
doors
standing
curiously
side
by
side
completely
sheltered
by
the
longer
porch
phoebus
looking
into
a
window
there
saw
a
table
already
set
with
a
clean
cloth
and
bread
and
cold
chicken
and
a
pitcher
of
creamy
milk
with
a
piece
of
ice
floating
in
it
on
either
side
of
a
large
fireplace
at
the
was
a
door
one
open
and
leading
by
a
small
winding
stair
to
the
floor
above
a
bed
was
also
in
the
room
which
looked
out
by
one
window
upon
the
lawn
and
the
river
and
by
the
other
at
the
farm
the
and
the
small
barns
and
with
a
sailor
quiet
sliding
feet
jimmy
walked
into
the
low
hall
and
a
in
a
cage
there
immediately
started
such
a
shrill
series
of
cries
that
his
steps
were
unheard
by
himself
nobody
bein
yer
thought
jimmy
an
the
flies
gittin
the
victuals
i
reckon
i
do
as
i
would
be
done
by
so
he
began
to
eat
and
soon
he
heard
a
female
voice
very
close
by
sound
down
the
stairs
as
if
reciting
to
another
person
aunt
patty
says
aunt
betty
first
husband
captain
twiford
was
a
and
a
widower
and
she
was
one
of
the
beautiful
hanley
girls
brought
up
by
old
ebenezer
johnson
at
his
house
across
on
broad
creek
and
there
captain
twiford
courted
her
and
brought
her
here
to
live
he
died
early
all
my
aunties
husbands
died
early
and
is
buried
in
the
vault
out
here
behind
the
pound
where
you
can
go
in
and
see
him
in
his
shroud
lying
by
aunt
betty
her
next
husband
john
gillis
left
her
and
then
she
lived
with
william
russell
a
aunt
patty
governed
all
her
sisters
and
the
johnson
boys
too
oh
how
i
fear
her
when
she
looks
at
me
sometimes
with
her
bold
black
eyes
i
ca
help
it
another
voice
not
a
woman
yet
almost
as
gentle
now
seemed
to
ask
a
question
but
the
behaving
like
a
detective
and
a
made
such
a
furious
screaming
at
seeing
a
stranger
drinking
the
milk
that
phoebus
could
not
hear
it
well
the
pleasant
female
voice
spoke
again
yes
he
was
killed
in
the
room
under
this
before
i
was
born
aunt
patty
says
and
sometimes
she
likes
to
tell
such
dark
and
bloody
tales
and
laughs
with
joy
to
see
me
frightened
at
them
aunt
betty
got
in
debt
and
this
house
and
farm
were
sold
under
executions
and
bought
by
a
maryland
man
who
stole
an
opportunity
when
the
men
were
away
and
set
his
goods
in
the
house
and
set
aunt
betty
goods
outside
upon
the
lawn
it
only
a
mile
or
a
little
more
from
here
to
ebenezer
johnson
and
the
news
of
the
seizure
was
sent
there
jimmy
tore
off
a
piece
of
chicken
with
his
teeth
listening
voraciously
did
you
hear
anything
continued
the
voice
i
thought
i
did
the
dogs
are
chained
up
in
the
and
bad
people
are
often
coming
here
i
will
go
turn
the
dogs
loose
be
dogged
if
you
do
jimmy
reflected
that
the
meanest
ever
i
see
fur
now
it
shut
up
there
sounded
something
familiar
to
the
uninvited
guest
in
the
voice
which
seemed
to
delay
this
intention
but
the
with
his
unaccommodating
mood
broke
right
in
again
then
the
female
continued
while
the
men
who
had
come
armed
expecting
trouble
were
removing
aunt
betty
goods
out
of
the
room
throwing
many
of
them
out
of
the
windows
so
as
to
be
themselves
in
sole
possession
a
sound
was
heard
in
the
room
below
where
your
meal
is
now
ready
like
a
panther
skipping
and
lashing
his
tail
and
before
the
men
could
breathe
old
ebenezer
johnson
was
up
the
stairs
and
laying
about
him
his
eyes
were
full
of
murder
one
man
jumped
right
through
that
window
and
rolled
off
the
porch
another
he
pitched
down
the
stairs
the
third
was
a
boy
joe
king
barely
grown
he
lives
not
far
from
this
house
now
and
ebenezer
johnson
dashed
him
down
the
stairs
too
and
started
after
him
all
his
life
the
boy
had
been
taught
to
dread
that
terrible
man
and
now
he
was
in
his
hands
or
flying
before
him
and
as
he
reeled
through
the
room
below
out
of
the
door
that
opens
on
the
back
porch
the
boy
eyes
in
the
agony
of
the
fear
of
death
beheld
a
rifle
leaning
there
mighty
good
thing
if
it
was
thar
now
jimmy
inwardly
remarked
finishing
the
chicken
and
still
hungry
oh
there
a
noise
somewhere
in
this
house
the
voice
exclaimed
i
never
tell
this
story
but
it
makes
me
startled
at
every
sound
the
boy
as
he
whirled
past
grasped
the
long
rifle
drew
it
to
his
shoulder
and
with
a
young
volunteer
skill
for
he
had
been
drilling
to
fight
the
british
he
put
the
two
balls
in
that
old
man
brain
both
balls
entered
over
the
left
eyebrow
and
one
passed
through
the
head
and
was
found
in
the
wall
the
other
never
was
found
the
lawless
giant
gave
a
trembling
motion
through
his
frame
his
eyes
glazed
and
he
sank
dead
upon
the
floor
without
a
sound
the
wicked
had
ceased
from
troubling
aunt
betty
aunt
patty
and
aunt
jane
three
sisters
shaped
by
him
in
soul
fell
on
his
body
and
wept
and
almost
prayed
but
it
was
too
late
they
buried
him
near
aunt
betty
in
the
field
behind
the
pound
undertaking
to
rise
from
his
chair
jimmy
phoebus
made
a
loud
scraping
on
the
floor
and
the
fell
with
a
ringing
sound
who
there
cried
a
voice
and
added
i
knew
the
dogs
ought
to
be
loose
who
there
also
asked
the
other
voice
with
something
very
familiar
to
phoebus
in
its
sounds
answered
jimmy
in
his
deepest
bass
tones
mentally
considering
that
a
ghost
might
carry
more
terror
than
a
robber
after
that
tale
a
little
scream
followed
and
a
whispered
consultation
and
then
a
girl
bare
feet
beautifully
moulded
slowly
descended
the
steep
stairway
and
next
a
slender
graceful
body
came
into
view
and
finally
a
face
delicious
as
a
ripe
peach
looked
once
at
the
intruder
below
and
all
the
pink
and
bright
color
faded
from
it
to
see
standing
there
where
ebenezer
johnson
had
given
up
the
ghost
a
stalwart
effigy
bandaged
in
white
all
round
the
head
and
over
the
left
eye
and
cheek
where
the
dead
had
received
his
double
bullet
the
blood
was
hideously
matted
and
not
wholly
stanched
even
yet
she
sank
slowly
down
upon
the
steps
and
saw
no
more
now
if
i
do
git
out
the
dogs
will
be
set
loose
muttered
jimmy
as
he
disappeared
up
the
lane
and
put
the
barn
and
pound
between
him
and
the
house
and
scarcely
had
he
done
so
when
levin
dennis
appeared
coming
down
the
stairs
all
unconscious
of
the
apparition
and
finding
the
beautiful
girl
insensible
he
raised
her
in
his
arms
and
stole
a
kiss
paying
for
his
one
act
of
deceit
by
losing
the
principal
object
of
his
quest
jimmy
phoebus
stopped
a
minute
by
ebenezer
johnson
grave
in
a
level
field
of
deep
sand
the
soil
here
being
the
poorest
in
the
region
and
between
the
and
the
pines
which
were
everywhere
jealous
of
their
other
indigenous
brother
the
indian
corn
an
old
family
lay
under
some
low
with
wild
berry
bushes
growing
all
around
there
were
several
little
stones
over
twifords
that
had
died
early
and
a
large
heap
of
sand
planted
with
some
flowers
that
might
have
covered
a
favorite
horse
but
which
phoebus
believed
was
the
of
the
river
buccaneer
and
there
was
also
a
vault
of
brick
and
plaster
with
the
little
door
ajar
where
prurient
visitors
themselves
with
saul
own
selfish
curiosity
to
raise
the
dead
had
poked
and
peeped
about
until
the
coffin
lids
had
been
drawn
back
and
the
dead
pair
exposed
to
the
dry
peninsular
air
the
bay
captain
looked
in
and
beheld
his
predecessor
captain
twiford
who
also
sailed
the
bay
lying
in
his
shroud
not
in
full
clothing
as
men
are
buried
now
for
clothing
was
too
valuable
in
the
country
to
feed
it
to
the
worms
twiford
lay
shrivelled
up
shroud
and
flesh
making
but
one
skin
the
face
of
a
walnut
color
the
hair
complete
the
teeth
sound
and
severe
dignity
unrelaxed
by
the
exposure
he
was
condemned
to
for
his
evil
alliance
with
betty
hanley
she
also
lay
exposed
who
had
lived
so
shamelessly
respecting
not
the
mould
of
beauty
god
had
given
her
till
now
men
leered
to
look
upon
her
nearly
bosom
glued
into
its
and
the
glory
of
her
hair
that
had
been
handled
by
bantering
outlaws
and
in
a
rippling
wave
of
unbleached
coal
covered
the
grinning
coquetry
of
her
skull
them
that
mocks
god
shall
be
mocked
of
him
said
jimmy
phoebus
closing
the
door
and
putting
some
of
the
scattered
bricks
of
the
vault
against
it
now
i
reckon
i
kin
git
to
the
by
a
leetle
after
dark
chapter
xxv
patty
cannon
phoebus
passed
along
the
side
of
a
large
black
and
found
the
boundary
stone
again
and
took
the
angle
from
its
northern
face
as
a
and
proceeding
in
that
direction
soon
fell
in
with
a
sort
of
blind
path
hardly
feasible
for
wheels
which
ran
almost
on
the
line
between
the
states
of
maryland
and
delaware
passing
in
sight
of
several
of
these
old
boundary
stones
not
a
dwelling
was
visible
as
he
proceeded
not
even
a
clearing
not
a
stream
except
one
mere
gutter
in
the
sand
not
a
man
hardly
an
animal
or
a
bird
the
monotonous
too
low
to
moan
too
thick
to
expand
too
dry
to
give
shade
yet
grew
and
grew
like
poor
folks
children
and
kept
company
only
with
some
scrubby
oaks
that
had
strayed
that
way
till
and
acorn
seemed
to
have
bred
upon
each
other
and
the
wild
hogs
disdained
the
progeny
maybe
i
git
killed
up
yer
in
this
pangymonum
jimmy
reflected
though
i
it
do
make
no
difference
whair
you
plant
your
bones
i
do
want
to
grow
up
into
ole
pines
good
big
preachin
kind
of
pines
that
a
little
above
the
world
an
says
rolley
mind
your
i
could
go
into
their
sap
and
shats
but
to
die
yer
an
never
be
found
in
these
desert
wastes
is
pore
salvage
for
a
man
that
lived
among
the
white
sails
of
the
bay
an
loved
a
woman
elegant
as
ellenory
it
was
dark
and
he
could
hardly
see
his
way
in
half
an
hour
sometimes
a
crow
would
caw
to
hear
strange
sounds
go
past
like
an
old
watchman
rattle
moved
one
cog
the
stars
became
bright
however
and
the
moon
was
new
and
when
phoebus
came
to
a
large
cleared
opening
in
the
pines
the
lambent
heavens
broke
forth
and
bathed
the
sandy
fields
with
silver
and
showed
a
large
high
house
at
the
middle
of
the
clearing
with
outside
chimneys
one
thicker
than
the
other
and
a
porch
of
two
stories
facing
the
east
though
not
a
large
dwelling
it
was
large
for
those
days
and
for
that
unfrequented
region
and
its
roof
seemed
to
phoebus
remarkably
steep
and
long
and
yet
while
enclosing
so
much
space
had
not
a
single
dormer
window
in
it
the
southern
gable
was
turned
towards
the
intruder
and
in
it
were
two
small
windows
at
the
top
crowded
between
the
thick
chimney
and
the
roof
slope
the
two
main
stories
were
well
lighted
however
and
the
porch
was
enclosed
at
the
farther
end
making
a
double
outside
room
there
no
sheds
kitchens
or
stables
were
attached
to
the
premises
but
an
old
like
some
catapult
reared
its
long
pole
at
half
an
angle
between
the
crotch
of
another
tree
roads
marked

patty

own
whar
she
did
all
her
fur
twenty
years
till
joe
got
rich
enough
to
build
his
palace
with
the
rapid
execution
of
a
man
who
only
plans
with
his
feet
and
hands
the
bay
sailor
observed
that
there
was
a
grove
of
good
high
timber
oaks
and
pines
only
a
few
rods
from
the
and
to
the
right
under
cover
of
which
he
could
draw
near
the
tavern
as
he
proceeded
to
gain
its
shade
he
heard
extraordinary
sounds
of
turbulence
from
the
front
of
the
tavern
the
yelling
of
men
the
baying
of
hounds
oaths
and
laughter
and
listening
as
he
crossed
the
intervening
space
he
fell
into
a
ditch
inadvertently
almost
at
the
edge
of
the
timber
hallo
cried
jimmy
lying
quite
still
to
draw
his
breath
since
the
ditch
was
now
perfectly
dry
this
ditch
seems
to
me
to
pint
right
for
that
tavern
he
therefore
crawled
along
its
dry
bed
till
it
crossed
under
a
road
by
a
wooden
culvert
or
little
bridge
of
a
few
planks
the
noise
at
the
tavern
was
now
like
a
fight
and
as
phoebus
continued
to
crawl
forward
he
heard
twenty
voices
crying
gouge
him
owen
daw
hit
him
agin
cyrus
james
chaw
him
right
up
give
em
room
boys
having
crawled
to
what
he
judged
the
nearest
point
of
concealed
approach
phoebus
lost
the
moment
to
take
a
single
glance
only
and
drawing
his
old
slouched
hat
down
on
his
face
to
hide
the
bandaging
he
muttered
now
jess
my
time
and
crept
up
to
the
back
of
the
crowd
which
was
all
facing
inwards
in
a
circle
and
did
not
perceive
him
a
fully
grown
man
as
it
seemed
was
having
a
fight
with
a
boy
hardly
fifteen
years
old
but
the
boy
was
the
more
reckless
and
courageous
of
the
two
while
the
man
with
three
times
the
boy
strength
lacked
the
stomach
or
confidence
to
avail
himself
of
it
and
having
had
the
boy
down
was
now
being
turned
by
the
latter
amid
shouts
of
three
to
two
on
owen
daw
bite
his
nose
off
owen
daw
five
to
two
that
cyrus
james
gits
gouged
by
owen
daw
the
boy
with
a
celtic
face
and
supple
body
was
full
of
zeal
to
merit
favor
and
inflict
injury
and
as
the
circle
of
vagrants
and
outlaws
of
all
ages
reeled
and
swayed
to
and
fro
phoebus
unobserved
by
anybody
put
his
head
down
among
the
rest
and
searched
the
faces
for
those
of
levin
dennis
or
joe
johnson
neither
was
there
and
the
only
face
which
arrested
his
attention
was
a
woman
standing
in
the
door
of
the
enclosed
space
at
the
end
of
the
porch
at
right
angles
to
the
central
door
of
the
tavern
and
just
beside
it
the
whole
building
was
without
paint
and
but
the
room
on
the
porch
was
manifestly
newer
as
if
it
had
been
an
afterthought
and
its
two
windows
revealed
some
of
the
crude
appendages
of
a
liquor
bar
as
a
fire
somewhere
within
flashed
up
and
lighted
it
by
this
fire
the
woman
face
was
also
revealed
and
she
was
so
much
interested
in
the
fight
that
she
turned
all
parts
of
her
countenance
into
the
firelight
slapping
her
hands
together
laughing
like
a
man
dropping
her
oaths
at
the
right
places
and
crying
i
bet
my
money
on
little
owen
daw
cy
james
ai
no
good
by
god
yer
whiskey
for
owen
daw
if
he
gouges
him
give
it
to
him
owen
daw
shame
on
ye
cy
james
there
was
occasional
servility
and
deference
to
this
woman
from
members
of
the
crowd
however
they
were
absorbed
in
the
fight
she
was
what
is
called
a
chunky
woman
short
and
thick
with
a
rosy
skin
low
but
pleasing
forehead
hair
a
rolling
way
of
swaying
and
moving
herself
a
pair
of
large
black
eyes
at
once
daring
furtive
and
familiar
and
a
large
neck
and
large
breast
uniting
the
and
the
dam
cruelty
and
full
womanhood
behind
this
woman
whom
phoebus
thought
to
be
patty
cannon
herself
the
moonlight
from
the
rear
came
through
the
door
in
the
older
and
main
building
shining
quite
through
the
house
and
phoebus
saw
that
the
rear
door
was
also
open
and
was
unguarded
he
took
the
first
chance
therefore
of
dodging
around
the
corner
of
the
bar
intending
to
pass
around
the
north
gable
of
the
house
and
dart
up
the
stairs
by
the
unwatched
door
but
he
had
barely
got
out
of
sight
when
a
loud
hurrah
burst
from
the
crowd
as
a
feeble
voice
was
heard
crying
enough
enough
followed
by
jeers
rapidly
approaching
the
large
outside
chimney
where
phoebus
now
was
had
an
arched
cavity
in
it
large
enough
to
contain
a
man
being
the
chimney
of
two
different
rooms
within
whose
smoke
uniting
higher
up
ascended
through
one
stem
into
this
cavity
phoebus
dodged
in
time
to
avoid
the
beaten
party
to
the
fight
the
grown
man
who
staggered
blindly
by
towards
a
well
his
face
dripping
blood
and
he
was
sobbing
babyishly
but
the
concealed
sailor
heard
him
say
in
a
whining
tone
she
set
him
on
me
i
make
her
pay
for
it
several
of
the
partisans
or
tormentors
of
this
craven
followed
after
him
and
jimmy
himself
fell
in
at
the
rear
and
instead
of
going
with
the
rest
towards
the
well
where
the
loser
was
bathing
his
face
phoebus
softly
stepped
over
the
low
sill
of
the
back
door
the
back
being
turned
to
him
and
as
he
had
anticipated
a
stairway
ascended
there
out
of
a
large
room
which
answered
the
purposes
of
parlor
and
hall
dining
and
gambling
room
as
jimmy
drank
in
at
one
glance
from
seeing
tables
dishes
and
cards
bottles
and
whips
arms
and
saddles
this
stairway
had
no
baluster
and
was
not
safe
in
the
dark
for
strangers
to
the
house
satisfying
himself
by
an
interior
observation
as
he
had
suspected
exteriorly
that
there
was
no
cellar
under
johnson
tavern
the
sailor
slipped
up
the
stairs
intent
to
find
where
judge
custis
property
and
ellenora
wayward
son
had
been
concealed
the
second
story
had
a
hall
which
opened
only
at
the
front
of
the
house
and
upon
the
upper
piazza
and
four
doors
upon
this
hall
indicated
four
bedrooms
one
of
them
was
ajar
and
peeping
through
phoebus
saw
extended
on
a
bed
oblivious
to
all
the
righting
and
din
outside
joe
johnson
the
his
form
revealed
by
a
lamp
and
the
open
fire
an
impulse
immediately
repressed
came
on
the
sailor
to
draw
his
knife
and
stab
johnson
to
the
heart
as
probably
the
villain
who
had
shot
him
from
the
the
wearily
turned
his
long
length
in
the
bed
and
phoebus
slipped
back
along
the
hall
to
the
only
door
besides
that
was
not
closed
fast
leading
into
the
room
at
the
rear
southern
corner
of
the
house
this
door
creaked
loudly
as
it
was
opened
and
a
man
of
a
bandit
form
and
dress
who
was
lying
on
a
pallet
within
revealed
by
the
bright
moonlight
streaming
in
at
two
windows
half
roused
himself
as
jimmy
crouched
at
the
door
where
a
partition
as
of
a
very
large
taking
up
fully
half
the
room
rose
between
the
intruder
and
the
occupant
who
there
exclaimed
a
voice
with
a
slight
lisp
in
it
jimmy
discovered
that
there
was
a
low
trap
or
door
near
the
floor
opening
into
this
remarkable
closet
and
he
slipped
inside
and
drew
his
knife
again
the
man
was
heard
moving
about
the
narrow
room
and
he
finally
seemed
to
walk
out
into
the
hall
and
down
the
stairs
feeling
around
his
closet
which
was
pitch
dark
phoebus
found
a
deep
indentation
in
it
as
of
a
smaller
closet
and
the
sound
of
crooning
voices
came
from
above
by
smoke
jimmy
mentally
exclaimed
this
big
closet
is
nothin
but
a
blind
fur
a
stairway
in
the
little
closet
to
climb
up
to
the
dungeon
under
the
big
roof
he
stole
out
again
and
found
the
moonlight
now
streaming
upon
an
empty
pallet
and
the
burly
watchman
gone
and
streaming
too
upon
a
larger
door
in
the
closet
opposite
the
indentation
he
had
felt
this
door
secured
by
a
padlock
through
a
staple
fastening
an
iron
bar
the
key
was
in
the
padlock
and
jimmy
turned
it
back
drew
off
the
lock
and
dropped
the
bar
the
moment
he
opened
the
door
an
almost
insupportable
smell
came
down
a
shallow
hatchway
within
up
which
leaned
a
rough
movable
and
of
stout
construction
that
smell
said
phoebus
entering
and
pulling
the
door
close
behind
him
might
be
wool
or
camel
or
a
moral
menagerie
from
the
royal
gardings
of
europe
but
i
guess
it
nigger
he
went
up
the
steep
steps
with
some
difficulty
as
they
were
made
to
pass
only
one
person
and
at
the
top
he
entered
a
large
garret
divided
into
two
by
a
heavy
partition
of
yellow
pine
with
a
door
at
the
middle
of
it
and
from
beyond
this
partition
came
the
sounds
of
crooning
and
babbling
he
had
heard
the
bright
night
shining
through
a
small
gable
window
revealed
this
outer
half
of
the
garret
empty
and
not
furniture
or
other
appurtenance
than
the
hole
in
the
floor
up
which
he
had
come
and
the
door
into
the
place
of
wailing
beyond
which
was
fastened
by
a
long
iron
spike
dropping
into
a
staple
that
overshot
a
heavy
wooden
bar
as
he
slipped
up
the
spike
and
took
the
bar
off
phoebus
heard
some
person
in
the
room
below
mutter
and
lock
the
great
padlock
upon
the
other
door
effectually
barring
his
escape
by
that
egress
we
must
take
things
as
they
come
thought
jimmy
grimly
partickler
in
pangymonum
whar
i
am
now
he
also
reflected
that
the
arrangements
of
this
kidnappers
pen
simple
as
they
seemed
were
quite
sufficient
if
authority
should
demand
to
search
the
house
the
double
below
with
the
ladder
pulled
up
into
the
loft
became
a
harmless
closet
hung
with
wardrobe
matters
and
the
inner
closet
a
storeroom
for
articles
of
bulk
and
no
human
being
could
either
go
up
or
come
down
without
passing
two
inhabited
floors
and
three
different
doors
besides
the
door
to
the
this
last
door
phoebus
now
threw
open
and
walked
into
the
pen
itself
stooping
his
head
to
avoid
the
low
entrance
for
some
minutes
he
could
not
see
the
contents
at
all
in
the
total
darkness
that
prevailed
as
there
was
no
window
whatever
in
this
pen
or
den
but
he
heard
various
voices
and
inhaled
the
strong
close
air
of
many
african
breaths
exhausting
the
supply
of
oxygen
and
knew
that
chains
and
irons
were
being
moved
against
the
boards
of
the
floor
thair
ai
nothin
to
do
yer
jimmy
remarked
softly
but
jess
squat
down
an
git
as
they
say
about
strangers
to
our
bilious
shore
an
git
your
eyeballs
tuned
to
the
dark
but
i
should
say
that
this
was
both
an
pangymonum
by
smoke
a
man
in
some
part
of
the
den
was
praying
in
a
highly
nervous
excited
way
slobbering
out
his
agonizing
sentences
and
dwelling
hard
upon
his
more
open
vowels
and
keeping
several
other
inmates
in
sympathy
or
equal
misery
as
they
piped
in
answer
to
his
apostrophes
lawd
o
my
lawd
i
will
not
let
dee
go
no
oh
my

now
o
my
lawd
phoebus
entrance
made
no
excitement
and
he
crouched
down
to
await
the
strengthening
of
his
eyes
to
see
around
him
the
place
appeared
to
be
nearly
feet
square
and
was
both
the
gable
way
and
under
the
sloping
roof
whose
eaves
were
planked
up
a
foot
or
two
above
the
floor
in
the
middle
any
man
could
stand
upright
and
scarcely
touch
the
ridge
beam
with
his
hands
but
along
the
sloping
sides
could
barely
sit
upright
the
man
still
continuing
to
express
his
absolute
subjection
of
spirit
in
a
frenzy
of
words
and
several
little
children
crying
and
shouting
responsively
phoebus
ordered
the
man
to
cease
after
asking
him
kindly
to
do
so
several
times
and
the
command
being
disobeyed
he
slapped
the
praying
one
with
his
open
hand
and
the
poor
wretch
rolled
over
in
a
kind
of
feeble
fit
a
little
child
somewhere
continuing
to
cry
phoebus
took
it
in
his
arms
and
held
between
it
and
the
starlight
at
the
door
one
of
the
shillings
he
had
obtained
from
the
old
cabin
on
broad
creek
a
few
hours
before
the
child
seeing
something
shine
seized
it
and
held
fast
and
phoebus
next
passed
his
hand
over
the
face
of
a
sleeping
man
who
was
snoring
calmly
and
strenuously
on
the
floor
beside
him
he
made
room
for
the
faint
light
to
shine
upon
the
sleeper
black
face
and
exclaimed
in
a
moment
if
it
ai
samson
hat
i
hope
i
may
be
swallered
by
a
whale
calling
his
name
samson
samson
phoebus
observed
a
most
dejected
mulatto
person
who
had
been
lying
back
in
the
shadows
crawl
forward
rattling
his
manacles
this
man
when
spoken
to
replied
with
such
refinement
and
accuracy
however
his
face
betokened
great
inward
misery
that
the
sailor
took
as
careful
a
survey
of
him
as
the
moonlight
permitted
coming
in
by
that
one
lean
attic
window
he
was
a
man
who
had
shaved
himself
only
recently
and
his
dark
curling
and
clean
lips
and
the
tuft
of
goatee
in
the
hollow
of
his
chin
and
intelligent
high
forehead
seemed
altogether
out
of
place
in
this
darksome
eyrie
of
the
sad
and
friendless
is
he
your
friend
sir
asked
this
man
turning
towards
samson
he
must
have
a
good
conscience
if
he
is
for
he
slept
soon
after
he
was
brought
here
and
has
never
uttered
a
single
complaint
and
you
have
i
reckon
said
the
waterman
oh
yes
sir
i
have
been
treated
with
such
ingratitude
it
would
break
any
gentleman
heart
to
hear
my
tale
who
is
your
friend
sir
samson

phoebus
shaking
the
sleeper
soundly
you

give
in
to

or
two
by
smoke

jimmy
the
old
negro
finally
said
with
a
sheepish
expression

his

close
down
to
the
poor
old
creature
sitting
there
in
her
checkered
turban
and
silver
earrings
clean
and
tidy
as
servants
of
the
olden
time
and
he
studied
her
vacant
countenance
her
tenantless
eyes
her
lips
moving
without
connection
or
relevance
and
felt
that
cruelty
had
inflicted
its
last
miraculous
injury
whipped
out
her
mind
from
its
venerable
residence
and
left
her
body
yet
to
suffer
the
pains
of
life
without
the
understanding
of
them

cried
the
sailor
tears

deceive
and
steal

the
man
crawled
back
into
the
blackness
of
the
den
again
and
phoebus
began
to
search
the
open
half
of
the
garret
for
implements
of
war
he
found
two
long
pieces
of
chain
with
which
determined
men
might
beat
out
an
adversary

thar
now
all
friends
of
jimmy
phoebus
all
well
armed
and
their
crews
enough
to
handle
pangymonum
a
noise
was
heard
at
the
lock
of
the
lower
door
and
phoebus
slipped
into
the
enclosed
den
and
took
his
station
just
within
the
door
remember
he
whispered
i
open
the
fight
the
lock
snapped
at
the
door
below
the
the
bolt
fell
and
the
light
of
a
lamp
flashed
up
the
hatchway
and
upon
the
naked
roof
and
through
the
cracks
of
the
boarded
garret
pen
the
sailor
knife
was
in
his
where
he
carried
it
over
the
hip
as
he
leaned
down
to
look
through
a
crack
in
the
low
door
he
felt
a
hand
from
the
gloom
behind
touch
him
instinctively
he
felt
for
his
knife
and
it
was
gone
captain
cried
the
voice
of
the
dejected
mulatto
as
the
door
of
the
pen
flew
open
and
the
stranger
appeared
with
the
lamp
there
a
white
man
here
going
to
kill
you
i
taken
his
knife
from
him
and
saved
your
life
it
a
rebellion
captain
help
patty
joe
cried
the
man
with
a
loud
voice
as
jimmy
phoebus
threw
himself
upon
him
and
extinguished
the
lamp
and
the
two
powerful
men
rolled
on
the
floor
together
in
a
grip
of
mortal
combat
phoebus
was
a
man
of
great
power
but
his
antagonist
was
strong
and
slippery
too
and
a
spirited
fighter
the
pungy
captain
was
on
top
the
bandit
man
locked
him
fast
in
his
arms
and
legs
and
tried
to
stab
him
in
the
side
as
phoebus
felt
the
handle
of
a
which
seemed
slow
to
obey
its
spring
strike
him
repeatedly
all
round
the
groin
in
strokes
that
would
have
killed
inflicted
by
the
blade
phoebus
attempted
to
drag
the
man
to
the
hatchway
and
force
him
down
it
while
the
two
negro
assistants
of
phoebus
beat
down
the
negro
traitor
with
their
chains
and
searched
him
vainly
for
the
knife
he
had
filched
at
last
phoebus
prevailed
and
his
antagonist
rolled
down
the
open
hatchway
seven
feet
or
more
still
keeping
his
desperate
hold
on
phoebus
and
dragging
him
along
and
both
might
have
cracked
their
skulls
but
for
a
woman
just
in
the
act
of
hurrying
up
the
ladder
against
whom
their
two
bodies
pitched
and
were
cushioned
upon
her
the
shock
however
stunned
both
of
them
and
when
phoebus
recollected
himself
he
was
tied
hand
and
foot
and
lying
on
the
garret
floor
again
and
over
him
stood
joe
johnson
flourishing
a
cowhide
the
bandages
had
again
been
torn
from
phoebus
face
and
he
was
bleeding
at
the
in
his
cheek
and
breathless
from
his
conflict
a
woman
had
dashed
a
vessel
of
water
into
his
face
and
this
had
revived
him
the
other
man
called
captain
had
meantime
by
the
aid
of
this
woman
the
same
phoebus
had
seen
subdued
and
tied
the
black
insurgents
and
both
of
them
were
flourishing
their
whips
over
the
backs
and
heads
of
the
prisoners
big
and
little
so
that
the
garret
was
no
slight
reflection
of
the
place
of
eternal
torment
as
the
shadows
of
the
monsters
under
the
weak
light
whipped
and
danced
against
the
beams
and
shingles
and
shrieks
and
shouts
of
mercy
blended
in
hideous
dissonance
the
woman
now
turned
her
lamp
on
the
sailor
rough
swarthy
injured
countenance
and
looked
him
over
out
of
her
dark
bold
eyes
joe
this
is
a
nigger
by
god
johnson
and
the
captain
also
examined
him
carefully
and
uttering
an
oath
the
former
kicked
the
prostrate
man
with
his
heavy
boot
i
popped
this
bloke
last
night
he
said
and
thought
the
scold

the

voice
of
samson
within
the
pen
his
chains

fur

to
the
light
the
captain
propped
samson
up
and
joe
johnson
glared
into
his
face
and
then
struck
him
down
with
the
handle
of
his
heavy
whip
patty
he
growled
that
nigger
scienced
he
the
champion
scrapper
of
somerset
he
knocked
me
down
and
i
marked
him
fur
it
and
now
by
god
i
to
burn
him
alive
on
twiford
island
he
swore
an
oath
half
blasphemous
half
blackguard
and
the
captain
murmured
with
a
lisp
the
white
man
is
the
only
make
sure
of
him
irons
were
produced
and
the
captain
speedily
fastened
phoebus
hands
in
a
clevis
and
hobbled
his
feet
and
placed
him
without
brutality
in
the
pen
and
further
chained
him
there
to
a
ring
in
the
joist
below
as
the
door
was
closed
and
bolted
a
voice
from
the
darkness
of
the
pen
cried
out
aunt
patty
let
me
out
i
saved
the
captain
life
i
took
the
white
man
knife
i
serve
you
faithfully
if
you
only
let
me
go
he
blowed
the
gab
said
joe
johnson
but
it
wo
serve
him
zeke
cried
the
woman
it
no
use
you
go
to
georgey
with
the
next
gang
you
an
the
white
nigger
thar
the
man
threw
himself
upon
the
floor
and
moaned
and
prayed
as
the
lamplight
disappeared
and
the
hatchway
slid
echoingly
over
the
stairs
and
the
lower
bolts
were
drawn
as
he
lay
there
in
horror
and
amid
contempt
a
voice
arrested
his
ears
near
by
singing
with
musical
and
easy
spirit
so
low
that
it
seemed
a
hymn
from
the
roads
and
fields
far
down
beneath
de
woun
dy
hands
have
made
in
dis
weak
helpless
soul
the
man
listened
with
awe
and
silence
as
if
a
spirit
hummed
the
tune
and
forgot
his
doom
of
slavery
a
moment
in
the
deeper
anguish
of
a
treacherous
heart
that
simple
hymn
bestirred
it
was
only
jimmy
phoebus
thinking
what
he
could
say
to
punish
this
double
traitor
most
who
had
turned
his
back
upon
his
race
and
upon
gratitude
and
jimmy
had
remembered
the
poor
woman
chained
to
the
tree
on
island
and
her
hymn
and
the
conclusion
was
flashed
upon
his
mind
that
the
mulatto
wretch
who
decoyed
her
away
and
sold
her
was
none
other
than
his
renegade
in
turn
made
merchandise
of
because
too
dangerous
to
set
at
large
in
the
probable
for
her
poor
mary
phoebus
slowly
spoke
in
his
deepest
tones
with
solemn
cadence
the
wretched
man
listened
and
trembled
mary
sperrit
callin
phoebus
continued
awful
in
his
inflection
the
miserable
procurer
heart
stopped
at
the
words
and
his
eyeballs
turned
in
torment
come
zeke
poor
mary
for
ye
cried
the
sailor
suddenly
in
a
voice
of
thunder
and
as
suddenly
relapsed
into
the
low
singing
of
the
quiet
hymn
again
de

at
the

of

had
reached
into
a
place
between
two
of
the
cypress
shingles
in
the
roof
where
he
had
hidden
the
sailor
knife
the
blade
being
pressed
out
of
sight
and
only
the
handle
within
his
grasp
it
had
been
overlooked
in
the
exciting
scenes
of
the
previous
few
minutes
and
now
recurred
to
his
mind
as
superstitious
passions
rolled
like
dreadful
meteors
across
the
black
and
hopeless
chasm
of
his
despairing
soul
when
the
low
drone
of
the
hymn
he
had
heard
his
victim
sing
to
her
baby
when
her
faith
in
him
was
pure
and
childlike
crossed
his
maddened
ears
again
he
raised
one
shriek
of
mercy
to
which
no
answer
fell
and
drew
the
blade
across
his
throat
and
fell
dead
in
the
kidnappers
den
chapter
xxvi
van
dorn
a
thin
fur
of
frost
was
on
the
level
and
the
saffron
and
orange
leaves
were
falling
almost
audibly
from
the
trees
as
levin
dennis
awoke
on
wednesday
in
the
long
low
house
standing
back
in
the
fields
from
johnson
and
drank
in
the
cool
stimulating
morn
the
sun
already
having
made
his
first
relay
and
his
postilion
horn
was
blowing
from
the
old
tavern
that
reared
its
form
so
broadly
and
yet
so
steeply
in
plain
sight
levin
had
been
brought
up
from
twiford
wharf
the
night
before
by
the
pretty
maid
whom
jimmy
phoebus
had
so
much
frightened
and
this
was
his
first
day
of
restful
feeling
having
slept
off
the
liquor
fumes
of
sunday
the
exciting
watches
of
monday
and
the
mingled
pleasure
and
pain
illness
and
interest
love
and
remorse
of
tuesday
he
had
felt
already
the
earliest
twinges
of
youthful
fondness
for
the
young
girl
he
had
spent
the
day
with
at
twiford
while
lying
sick
there
from
a
disordered
stomach
and
nervous
system
and
her
amiability
and
charms
more
than
the
temptation
of
unhallowed
money
had
changed
his
purpose
to
escape
at
twiford
and
give
information
of
the
injury
inflicted
upon
judge
custis
property
it
hardly
seemed
real
that
he
had
been
an
accessory
to
a
felony
and
a
witness
to
a
murder
the
stealing
of
a
gentleman
domestic
slaves
and
the
braining
of
the
smallest
and
most
helpless
of
them
nearly
in
his
sight
yet
so
it
had
happened
and
he
felt
the
danger
he
was
in
but
hesitated
how
to
act
he
had
accepted
the
money
of
the
trader
and
passed
his
mother
noblest
friend
on
the
river
without
recognition
while
a
dastardly
ball
had
probably
ended
poor
phoebus
career
to
all
these
deeds
he
was
the
only
white
witness
the
only
one
on
whose
testimony
redress
could
be
meted
out
he
felt
therefore
that
he
was
a
prisoner
and
his
life
dependent
on
his
cordial
relations
with
the
bloody
and
his
band
and
johnson
had
reiterated
his
promise
that
if
levin
joined
them
in
equal
fraternity
he
should
make
money
fast
and
become
a
plantation
proprietor
this
night
coming
a
raid
on
free
negroes
in
delaware
was
to
be
made
by
the
band
in
force
and
levin
had
been
told
that
he
must
be
one
of
the
kidnappers
and
his
frank
that
night
would
forever
relieve
him
of
any
suspicions
of
defection
and
bad
faith
steal
one
nigger
levin
joe
johnson
had
said
and
then
if
ever
caught
in
the
hock
you
never
can
snickle
levin
interpreted
this
thieves
language
to
mean
that
he
must
do
a
crime
to
get
the
kidnappers
confidence
the
power
of
this
band
he
had
divined
a
little
of
when
at
points
along
the
river
especially
about
vienna
there
had
been
mysterious
intercourse
between
joe
johnson
and
people
on
the
shore
carried
on
in
imitations
of
animal
sounds
and
the
negro
ferryman
at
that
old
dorchester
village
had
spoken
with
johnson
only
half
an
hour
before
the
trader
encounter
with
jimmy
phoebus
in
whereupon
the
grim
passenger
had
produced
his
pistol
and
notified
levin
now
my
feller
prig
honor
what
i
expect
from
you
and
to
remind
you
of
it
levin
i
to
pint
this
at
your
mummer
so
that
if
you
patter
a
cackle
a
blue
plum
will
go
right
down
your
throat
he
had
then
tried
to
evade
some
one
expected
on
the
river
and
in
a
fit
of
rage
at
the
awakening
and
wailing
of
the
child
had
hushed
it
forever
and
then
had
shot
phoebus
down
poor
hominy
had
sincerely
believed
that
johnson
peculiar
slang
was
the
language
of
the
good
quakers
followers
of
elias
hicks
who
sheltered
runaway
slaves
and
spoke
a
thee
and
thou
and
verily
and
that
strange
misapprehension
in
her
ignorant
mind
the
keen
dealer
had
made
use
of
to
decoy
her
into
levin
vessel
and
waft
her
into
a
distant
country
we
did
steal
her
levin
johnson
said
she
wanted
to
mizzle
from
a
good
master
an
we
jess
sells
the
crooked
moke
an
makes
it
squar
when
aunt
hominy
having
under
her
protecting
care
the
little
children
came
on
board
the
at
manokin
landing
levin
had
been
asleep
and
knew
nothing
of
the
theft
till
it
was
too
late
to
protest
and
johnson
himself
had
sailed
the
into
broad
water
then
bearing
through
kedge
strait
he
had
cruised
up
the
open
bay
out
of
sight
of
the
somerset
shore
and
entered
the
nanticoke
towards
night
by
way
of
harper
strait
and
run
up
on
the
night
flood
but
the
instinct
of
jimmy
phoebus
had
cut
him
off
at
the
forks
of
the
nanticoke
and
propelled
another
crime
to
johnson
old
suspected
record
he
had
never
been
indicted
yet
for
murder
though
murder
was
thought
to
be
none
too
formidable
a
crime
for
him
there
was
a
zest
of
adventure
in
this
guilty
errand
which
but
for
its
crime
would
have
pleased
levin
moderately
well
the
roving
drop
in
his
blood
expanding
to
this
wild
association
and
he
knew
but
little
comparatively
of
the
delaware
kidnappers
reading
nothing
and
in
those
days
little
was
printed
about
patty
cannon
band
except
in
the
distant
journals
like
or
genius
of
levin
had
never
sailed
up
the
nanticoke
region
before
and
its
scenery
was
agreeable
to
his
sight
while
his
heart
was
just
fluttering
in
the
first
flight
of
sentiment
towards
the
interesting
creature
he
had
so
unexpectedly
and
as
he
thought
so
strangely
discovered
there
arriving
at
twiford
in
the
night
johnson
had
sent
him
to
bed
there
and
pushed
on
himself
with
the
negro
property
to
johnson
and
when
he
awakened
late
the
next
day
levin
had
found
a
beautiful
wildflower
of
a
young
woman
sitting
by
his
pallet
looking
into
his
large
soft
eyes
with
her
own
orbs
of
humid
gray
and
brushing
his
dark
auburn
ringlets
with
her
hand
as
he
had
looked
up
wonderingly
she
had
said
to
him
i
have
never
seen
a
man
before
with
his
hair
parted
in
the
middle
but
i
think
i
have
dreamed
of
one
who
air
you
levin
asked
me
oh
i
hulda
i
patty
cannon
granddaughter
that
wicked
woman
levin
exclaimed
oh
i
ca
believe
that
nor
can
i
sometimes
till
the
sinful
truth
comes
to
me
from
her
own
bold
lips
oh
sir
i
am
not
as
wicked
as
she
how
kin
you
be
wicked
at
all
levin
asked
when
you
look
so
good
i
would
trust
your
face
in
jail
would
you
how
happy
that
makes
me
to
be
trusted
by
some
one
nobody
seems
to
trust
me
here
my
mother
was
never
kind
to
me
captain
van
dorn
is
kind
but
too
kind
i
shrink
from
him
where
is
your
mother
now
she
has
gone
south
with
her
husband
to
live
in
florida
for
all
the
rest
of
her
life
and
we
are
all
going
there
after
father
gets
one
more
drove
of
slaves
you
are
one
of
father
men
i
suppose
who
is
your
father
joe
johnson
that
man
murmured
levin
oh
no
it
is
too
horrible
do
not
hate
me
be
a
little
kind
if
you
do
for
i
have
watched
you
here
hours
almost
hoping
you
never
might
wake
up
so
beautiful
and
pure
you
looked
asleep
and
you
that
the
way
you
look
huldy
how
kin
you
look
so
an
be
his
daughter
i
am
not
his
child
thank
god
he
is
my
stepfather
what
is
your
name
then
besides
huldy
the
girl
blushed
deeply
and
hesitated
her
fine
gray
eyes
were
turned
upon
her
beautiful
bare
feet
white
as
the
river
that
flashed
beneath
the
window
hulda
bruinton
she
said
swallowing
a
sigh
bruinton
where
did
i
hear
that
name
levin
asked
some
tale
has
been
told
me
i
reckon
about
him
yes
everybody
knows
it
hulda
said
in
a
voice
of
pain
he
was
hanged
for
murder
at
georgetown
when
i
was
a
little
child
levin
could
not
speak
for
astonishment
i
might
as
well
tell
you
she
said
for
others
will
if
i
conceal
it
i
can
hardly
remember
my
father
my
mother
soon
married
joe
and
neglected
me
and
aunt
patty
my
grandmother
brought
me
up
she
was
kind
to
me
but
oh
how
cruel
she
can
be
to
others
you
talk
as
if
you
kin
read
huldy
said
levin
wishing
to
change
so
harsh
a
topic
kin
you
yes
i
can
read
and
write
as
well
as
if
i
had
been
to
school
some
one
taught
me
the
letters
around
the
tavern
some
of
the
i
think
it
was
colonel
mclane
and
i
had
a
gift
for
it
i
think
because
i
began
to
read
very
soon
and
then
aunt
patty
made
me
read
books
to
her
oh
such
dreadful
books
what
wair
they
huldy
the
lives
of
pirates
and
the
trials
of
murderers
about
murrell
band
and
the
poisonings
of
lucretia
chapman
the
execution
of
thistlewood
and
captain
kidd
voyages
the
last
i
read
her
was
the
story
of
burke
and
hare
who
smothered
people
to
death
in
the
canongate
of
edinburgh
last
year
to
sell
their
bodies
to
the
doctors
must
you
read
such
things
to
her
i
think
that
is
the
only
influence
i
have
over
her
sometimes
she
looks
so
horribly
at
me
and
mutters
such
threats
that
i
fear
she
is
going
to
kill
me
and
so
i
hasten
to
get
her
favorite
books
and
read
to
her
the
dark
crimes
of
desperate
men
and
women
and
she
laughs
and
listens
like
one
hearing
pleasant
tales
my
soul
grows
sick
but
i
see
she
is
fascinated
and
i
read
on
trying
to
close
my
mind
to
the
cruel
narrative
huldy
air
you
a
purty
devil
drawin
me
outen
my
heart
to
ruin
me
no
no
oh
do
not
believe
that
i
suppose
all
men
are
cruel
and
all
i
ever
knew
were
or
i
should
believe
you
too
gentle
to
live
by
that
brutal
work
i
looked
at
you
lying
in
this
bed
and
pity
and
love
came
over
me
to
see
you
so
young
and
fair
entering
upon
this
life
of
treachery
and
sin
levin
gazed
at
her
intently
and
then
raised
up
and
looked
around
him
and
peered
down
through
the
old
dormers
into
the
green
yard
and
the
floody
river
hastening
by
with
such
nobility
air
we
watched
he
inquired
by
none
in
this
house
all
the
men
are
away
making
ready
for
the
hunt
night
the
river
is
watched
and
you
would
not
be

very
far
but
in
this
house
i
am
your
jailer
joe
told
me
he
would
sell
me
if
i
let
you
get
away
levin
listened
and
looked
once
more
ardently
and
wonderingly
at
her
and
fell
upon
his
knees
at
her
uncovered
feet
then
huldy
hear
me
lady
with
such
purty
eyes
i
must
believe
in
wicked

look
at

my
life

has
often
threatened
to
sell
me
to
some
trader
whose
bold
and
wicked
eyes
stared
at
me
so
coarsely
and
i
have
heard
them
talk
of
a
price
as
if

was
the
merchandise
to
be
transferred

in
whose
veins
every
drop
of
blood

after

table

been
set
that
jimmy
phoebus
slipped
in
and
devoured
the
milk
and
meat
overhearing
the
continuance
of
the
conversation
just
given
and
when
his
awkward
motions
had
disturbed
these
new
young
friends
hulda
fainted
on
the
stairs
before
the
apparition
levin
did
not
see
and
he
snatched
the
kiss
that
was
like
plucking
a
blossom
from
some
dragon
garden
that
night
two
horses
without
saddles
came
to
bring
them
both
to
johnson
and
levin
awoke
at
patty
cannon
old
residence
on
the
neighboring
farm
he
looked
out
of
the
small
window
in
the
low
roof
upon
a
little
garden
where
a
short
stout
powerfully
made
woman
barefooted
was
taking
up
some
flowers
from
their
beds
to
put
them
into
boxes
of
earth
yer
huldy
exclaimed

woman

ef
she
did
come
with
flowers
in
her
hat
a
mischievous
was
in
a
large
apparently
domesticated
there
and
he
occupied
himself
mimicking
over
the
head
the
alternate
cries
of
a
little
bird
in
terror
and
a
hawk
scream
of
victory
shet
up

woman

been
cock
of
the
walk
sence
i
was
a
gal
as
hulda
also
barefooted
but
moulded
like
the
flowers
so
that
her
feet
seemed
natural
as
the
naked
roots
carried
the
boxes
around
to
the
glass
beds
encircling
a
chimney
dahlias
autumnal
crocuses
or
saffrons
chrysanthemums
or
and
the
marigolds
the
elder
woman
resting
on
her
hoe
smelled
the
turpentine
of
a
row
of
tall
sunflowers
and
twisted
one
off
and
put
it
in
her
leghorn
hat
when
i
hornpipe
it
on
the
tight
rope
levin
heard
her
chuckle
one
of
these
yer
big
flowers
must
die
with
me
she
disappeared
into
the
peach
orchard
which
tinted
the
garden
with
its
pinkish
boughs
and
levin
improved
the
chance
to
look
over
the
cottage
and
the
landscape
it
was
a
mere
farm
level
as
a
floor
part
of
a
larger
clearing
in
the
primeval
woods
where
only
fire
or
age
had
preyed
since
man
was
come
and
although
there
seemed
more
land
than
belonged
to
this
property
no
other
house
could
levin
see
over
all
the
prospect
except
the
bold
and
tarnished
form
of
johnson
castle
sliding
its
long
porch
forward
at
the
base
of
that
tall
blank
inexpressive
roof
which
seemed
suspended
like
the
drab
curtain
of
a
theatre
between
the
solemn
chimney
towers
the
northern
chimney
broad
and
huge
and
bottomed
on
an
arch
the
southern
chimney
leaner
but
erect
as
a
perpetual
sentry
on
the
road
the
house
where
levin
dennis
now
looked
out
was
a
frame
double
cabin
with
beds
in
every
room
but
the
kitchen
and
the
gave
considerable
bed
accommodation
in
the
attic
besides
the
rooms
being
all
small
as
was
general
in
that
day
around
the
house
extended
a
pretty
garden
with
some
cherry
and
plum
trees
and
wild
peach
along
its
boundaries
and
the
fields
around
contained
many
stumps
showing
that
the
clearing
had
been
made
not
many
years
before
while
here
and
there
some
heaps
of
brush
had
been
allowed
to
accumulate
instead
of
being
burned
as
levin
looked
at
one
of
those
in
a
low
place
a
pair
of
buzzards
slowly
and
clumsily
circled
up
from
it
and
flying
low
went
round
and
round
as
if
they
might
be
rearing
their
young
there
and
hated
to
go
far
and
for
long
afterwards
levin
saw
them
hovering
high
above
the
spot
in
parental
mindfulness
he
drew
his
head
in
the
dormer
casement
and
was
making
ready
to
go
down
to
the
breakfast
he
smelled
cooking
below
when
his
own
name
was
pronounced
in
the
garden
and
he
stopped
and
listened
you
lie
exclaimed
the
old
woman
voice
i
mash
you
to
the
ground
he
said
so
grandma
indeed
he
did
levin
had
a
peep
from
the
depths
of
the
garret
and
he
saw
that
cannon
was
standing
with
the
hoe
she
had
been
using
raised
over
head
while
a
demoniac
expression
of
rage
distorted
her
not
unpleasing
features
levin
walked
at
once
to
the
window
and
whistled
as
if
to
the
bird
in
the
tree
the
older
woman
immediately
dropped
her
hoe
and
cried
out
to
levin
heigh

at
once
went
down
the
short
winding
stairs
to
a
table
spread
in
the
kitchen
end
and
the
old
woman
blew
a
tin
horn
towards
as
if
summoning
other
boarders
and
then
she
said
to
levin
with
a
very
pleasing
countenance

slightly
raised
her
eyes
which
levin
took
to
mean
assent
and
he
said

eye
full
of
congested
blood

the

cowardly

inquisitively
and
looked
sullen
and
ashamed
at
hulda

observed

why
captain
honey
ai
ye
hungry
this
was
addressed
to
a
man
with
several
bruises
on
his
forehead
and
an
enormous
flaxen
mustache
as
soft
in
texture
as
a
child
hair
a
man
wearing
delicate
boots
with
high
flemish
leggings
that
curled
over
and
showed
full
women
hose
of
red
over
which
were
buckled
trousers
of
buff
corduroy
covering
his
thighs
only
and
fastened
above
his
hips
by
a
belt
of
hide
his
shirt
was
of
blue
figured
stuff
and
his
loose
unbuttoned
coat
was
a
kind
of
sailor
jacket
of
tarnished
black
velvet
he
hung
a
broad
slouched
hat
of
a
color
soft
like
all
his
clothing
upon
a
peg
in
the
wall
and
bowed
to
hulda
first
with
a
smile
of
welcome
to
madame
cannon
cavalierly
and
to
levin
with
a
graceful
reserve
that
attracted
the
boy
attention
from
the
notorious
woman
at
he
head
of
the
table
and
held
him
interested
during
all
the
meal
pretty
hulda
i
salute
you
patty
dias
i
hope
i
see
you
well
friend
the
last
to
levin
as
he
took
up
his
knife
and
fork
levin
observed
a
ring
with
a
pure
white
diamond
in
it
flash
upon
the
captain
hand
he
was
a
man
with
a
blush
and
a
lisp
at
once
as
of
one
shy
but
at
times
he
would
look
straight
and
bold
at
some
one
of
the
group
and
then
he
seemed
to
lose
his
delicacy
and
become
coarse
and
cold
one
such
look
he
gave
at
hulda
who
bowed
her
eyes
before
it
and
looked
at
him
but
little
again
to
levin
this
man
had
the
greatest
fascination
partly
from
his
extraordinary
dress
like
costumes
levin
had
seen
at
the
theatre
in
baltimore
where
the
pirates
on
the
stage
wore
a
jacket
and
open
shirt
and
belt
similar
in
cut
though
not
in
material
and
partly
from
his
countenance
in
which
was
something
very
familiar
to
the
boy
though
he
racked
his
memory
in
vain
for
the
time
and
place
the
stranger
was
hardly
more
than
forty
to
years
of
age
but
the
mistress
of
the
house
treated
him
with
all
the
blandishments
of
a
husband
dear
captain
pore
honey
she
said
to
have
his
beautiful
yaller
hair
tored
out
by
the
nigger
hawk
honey
he
fell
onto
me
and
i
thought
a
bull
had
butted
me
in
the
stummick
he
broke
no
limbs
patty
the
captain
lisped
feeding
himself
in
a
dainty
way
and
levin
observed
that
his
fork
was
silver
and
his
knife
was
a
with
a
silver
handle
that
he
had
taken
from
his
pocket
chis
if
he
had
snapped
my
arm
the
caravan
must
have
gone
without
me
i
am
sore
though
for
señor
was
a
valiant
wrestler
he
git
his
pay
honey
when
they
sot
him
to
work
in
georgey
an
flog
him
right
smart
an
we
spend
the
price
of
him
fur
punch
he
he
lovey
lad
i
took
this
from
him
when
i
searched
him
carefully
the
captain
said
handing
patty
cannon
a
piece
of
silver
coin
the
woman
though
she
looked
to
be
little
more
than
fifty
years
of
age
drew
out
spectacles
of
silver
from
an
old
leather
case
and
putting
them
on
spelled
out
the
coin
george
three
eighteen
eighteen
she
threw
up
her
head
so
quickly
that
the
spectacles
dropped
from
her
nose
and
hulda
caught
them
and
then
cannon
turned
on
hulda
with
a
ferocious
expression
and
snatched
the
spectacles
from
her
hand
whar
did
the
devil
git
it
patty
cannon
asked
ah
who
knows
the
captain
lisped
with
pale
nonchalance
giving
one
of
those
strong
piercing
looks
he
sometimes
afforded
right
into
the
hostess
eyes
it
might
be
a
coincidence
chito
a
shilling
of
a
certain
year
is
no
rare
thing
but
madame
cannon
it
becomes
slightly
curious
when
six
such
shillings
all
numbered
with
that
significant
year
came
out
of
the
same
pocket
with
this
he
passed
five
shillings
of
the
same
appearance
over
to
the
hostess
and
she
put
on
her
spectacles
again
and
looked
at
them
all
and
dropped
them
in
her
lap
with
a
weary
yet
frightened
expression
and
muttered
van
dorn
who
kin
he
be
that
is
of
less
consequence
my
dear
than
whether
we
can
afford
to
sell
him
the
captain
was
now
looking
at
hulda
with
the
same
strong
intentness
but
her
eyes
were
in
her
plate
and
though
madame
cannon
looked
at
her
too
with
both
interest
and
dislike
hulda
quietly
ate
on
unconscious
of
their
regard
shoo
the
woman
said
people
kin
scare
theirselves
every
day
if
they
mind
to
we
got
him
and
if
he
knows
anything
it
all
in
that
nigger
noddle
so
eat
and
be
derned
my
guardian
angel
the
captain
remarked
with
a
blush
and
a
stronger
lisp
you
may
not
have
observed
that
i
have
never
ceased
to
eat
while
you
immediately
lost
your
appetite
what
will
you
do
with
the
shillings
cannon
took
them
from
her
lap
and
rose
as
if
she
meant
to
throw
them
out
of
the
window
her
angry
face
bearing
that
interpretation
stop
remarkable
woman
the
captain
said
pulling
his
soft
flaxen
mustache
with
the
hand
let
your
fecund
resources
stop
and
counsel
for
i
am
only
looking
to
your
happiness
that
has
so
abundantly
blessed
my
life
and
banished
every
superstition
from
my
heart
till
i
believe
in
neither
ghosts
nor
god
nor
devil
while
you
believe
in
all
of
them
and
give
yourself
many
such
unnecessary
friends
and
intruders
chito
as
the
cubans
say
and
hear
my
suggestion
before
you
throw
away
those
shillings
take
care
how
you
mock
me
cried
patty
cannon
with
her
dark
bold
eyes
furtive
like
one
both
angered
and
troubled
and
her
ruddy
cheeks
full
of
cloudy
blood
sit
down
give
the
shillings
to
pretty
hulda
there
to
her
ya
to
pleasing
hulda
for
what
will
trouble
us
then
her
sinless
bosom
being
their
safe
depository
and
her
eyes
melting
our
ghosts
to
gray
air
with
a
look
of
strong
dislike
the
woman
gave
hulda
the
shillings
saying
if
you
ever
show
one
of
to
me
gal
i
make
you
swaller
it
hulda
took
the
silver
pieces
and
looked
at
them
a
moment
with
girlish
delight
oh
grandma
how
kind
you
are
why
do
you
speak
so
mad
at
me
when
you
give
me
these
pretty
things
they
seem
almost
warm
in
my
bosom
as
i
put
them
there
like
things
with
life
let
me
kiss
you
for
them
she
rose
from
the
chair
and
approached
the
mistress
of
the
house
who
sat
in
a
strange
terror
not
forbidding
the
embrace
yet
almost
shuddering
as
hulda
stooped
and
pressed
her
pure
young
lips
to
the
blanched
and
dissipated
face
of
patty
cannon
the
captain
looked
at
the
kiss
with
his
peculiar
strong
cold
look
and
smiled
at
hulda
graciously
and
said
there
ladies
repose
in
each
other
confidence
a
few
shillings
for
such
a
kiss
is
shameful
pay
aunt
patty
do
you
remember
as
well
as
i
do
madame
cannon
that
once
you
missed
some
money
and
thought
your
mother
had
stolen
it
and
hunted
everywhere
for
it
and
it
never
came
to
light
yes
cried
patty
cannon
i
do
and
swore
a
man
oath
has
the
señor
been
in
that
direction
do
you
think
i
think
he
has
for
melson
and
milman
are
up
from
twiford
with
the
news
that
zeke
last
hide
has
burst
her
chain
and
fled
and
all
the
lower
nanticoke
gives
no
trace
of
her
and
zeke
has
passed
the
heavenly
gates
the
captain
drew
the
back
of
his
silver
across
his
throat
smilingly
and
placed
on
the
table
a
sailor
zeke
only
was
untied
it
was
a
too
generous
omission
he
said
the
philadelphia
woman
the
señor
says
he
set
free
and
that
she
has
gone
to
start
an
alarm
against
us
the
señor
is
a
cool
man
he
told
me
that
and
laughed
and
roared
and
says
he
will
live
to
see
us
all
in
a
patty
with
her
face
growing
longer
and
longer
the
woman
heard
these
scarcely
intelligible
sentences
wholly
unintelligible
to
the
younger
people
and
to
levin
it
seemed
that
she
grew
suddenly
old
and
yet
older
till
her
cheeks
but
lately
blooming
seemed
dead
and
wrinkled
and
from
maintaining
the
appearance
of
hardly
fifty
and
fair
at
that
she
now
looked
to
be
more
than
sixty
years
of
age
and
sad
and
helpless
van
dorn
i
dying
she
muttered
as
her
eyes
glazed
and
she
settled
down
in
her
chair
like
a
lump
of
dough
o
hala
hands
off
fair
hulda
the
captain
cried
joyfully
as
hulda
had
been
moved
to
relieve
the
poor
old
woman
no
one
shall
assist
at
these
ceremonies
of
expiation
but
van
dorn
himself
whose
rights
in
mistress
cannon
are
of
priority
she
dropsical
and
hastening
to
perdition
too
soon
which
i
must
arrest
and
let
her
comfort
me
still
more
sweet
comforter
young
gentleman
you
shall
help
me
levin
took
hold
of
patty
cannon
feet
and
found
that
she
seemed
made
of
bone
so
tough
were
her
sinews
and
van
dorn
easily
lifted
her
broad
shoulders
and
so
she
was
laid
on
a
bed
in
the
next
room
where
the
elegant
captain
was
seen
rubbing
her
limbs
and
even
handling
a
bottle
of
leeches
one
of
which
he
allowed
to
crawl
over
the
hand
that
wore
the
diamond
making
it
look
like
a
ruby
melting
or
in
living
motion
as
this
voracious
took
his
fill
around
the
straight
ankles
of
the
hostess
the
dainty
captain
held
her
in
his
arms
like
an
ardent
lover
honey
sighed
the
woman

but
never

patty
as
when
they
flash
on
some
new
wicked
idea
like
this
of
marking
the
boy
for
life
who
is

he
a

one
of
the
stock
that
my
delaware

young
cousin
made
a
felon
then

scorched
so
the
devil
will
know
him
fur
his
own
the
captain
reached
down
to
the
lady
feet
and
pulled
off
the
leech
and
held
it
up
against
his
hollow
palm
gorged
with
the
blood
of
the
fair
patient
see
patty
the
boy
shall
drink
blood
like
this
till
drunk
with
it
he
can
hold
on
no
more
and
drops
into
our
fate
as
in
this
vial
as
he
spoke
he
let
the
leech
fall
in
the
bottle
where
its
reflection
in
the
glass
seemed
to
splash
blood

dorn
i
love

the
woman
cried
and
smothered
him
with
caresses
chapter
xxvii
cannon
ferry
when
it
was
announced
to
levin
and
hulda
who
had
meantime
been
talking
in
the
garden
dangerously
near
the
subject
of
love
that
they
were
to
be
given
a
ride
to
cannon
ferry
with
captain
van
dorn
at
the
especial
desire
of
aunt
patty
cannon
who
also
sent
them
a
handful
of
to
spend
they
were
both
delighted
though
hulda
said
dear
levin
if
it
was
only
ourselves
going
for
good
how
happy
we
might
be
i
could
live
with
your
beautiful
mother
and
work
for
her
and
knowing
me
to
be
always
there
you
would
bring
your
money
home
instead
of
wasting
it
ca
we
do
so
some
way
asked
levin
oh
i
wish
i
had
some
sense
i
wish
jimmy
phoebus
was
yer
huldy
to
take
me
out
thair
in
the
garden
an
whip
me
like
my
father
but
if
i
had
come
yer
how
could
i
have
seen
you
huldy
how
could
i
have
spent
such
a
heavenly
night
of
peace
and
hope
if
you
had
not
come
dear
the
good
being
must
have
led
you
to
me
huldy
said
levin
after
thinking
to
the
range
of
his
knowledge
maybe
thar
a
at
cannon
ferry
an
you
kin
write
a
letter
to
jack
wonnell
fur
me
why
not
to
your
mother
levin
oh
i
am
ashamed
to
tell
her
it
would
kill
her
if
we
should
be
found
out
levin
aunt
patty
would
kill
me
there
is
no
paper
here
no
ink
that
i
can
get
the
postage
on
a
letter
is
almost
nineteen
cents
and
look
these
are
short
of
the
sum
by
just
two
i
have
gold
cried
levin
thinking
of
the
residue
of
joe
bounty
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
but
the
money
was
no
longer
there
hush
cried
hulda
you
have
been
robbed
everybody
is
robbed
who
sleeps
here
grandma
can
smell
gold
like
the
rat
that
finds
yellow
cheese
the
individual
who
had
served
the
breakfast
was
seen
coming
towards
them
a
man
in
size
with
a
low
forehead
no
chin
to
speak
of
a
long
crane
neck
and
a
badly
scratched
and
festered
face
mister
he
said
to
levin
come
help
me
hitch
the
horses
i
beat
so
i
ca
see
how
levin
started
at
once
suggesting
to
hulda
to
make
search
for
his
missing
money
and
when
they
were
in
the
little
stable
the
man
observed
in
a
whisper
to
levin
by
smoke
levin
went
on
putting
the
bridles
and
breeching
on
the
horses
when
the
man
said
again
with
an
insinuating
grin
by
smoke
heigh
exclaimed
levin
by
smoke
the
man
remarked
again
with
a
very
ardent
emphasis
you
must
have
been
in
prencess
anne
levin
said
to
swar
smoke
the
man
with
such
an
inferior
head
and
cranish
neck
now
slipped
around
to
the
front
of
levin
and
looked
down
on
him
and
whispered
the
idea
crossed
levin
mind
that
the
scullion
of
patty
cannon
must
have
gone
crazy
whair
did
you
pick
up
them
words

with

and
bent
down
like
a
great
goose
and
stared

levin
eyes
i
never
had
sense

said
to
guess

riddle

he
dropped
his
palms
to
his
knees
again
and
whispered
fur
i
know
whar
ole
patty
buries
her
gole
an
silver
come
with
those
horses
you
idle
lads
the
lisping
voice
of
the
captain
was
heard
to
call
ya
there
the
morning
passes
on
all
ready
cy
james
replied
and
as
they
left
the
stable
door
he
whispered
once
again
and
looked
significantly
towards
by
smoke
an
pangymonum
too
the
captain
looking
like
a
gentleman
of
the
knightly
ages
misplaced
in
this
forest
lair
held
the
reins
standing
on
the
ground
and
handed
hulda
in
to
the
seat
beside
his
own
with
a
grace
and
a
blush
and
a
lisping
laugh
that
levin
thought
were
very
fascinating
now
master
cannon
take
your
place
in
the
tail
of
the
vehicle
the
captain
said
bowing
to
levin
and
darting
one
of
those
cold
coarse
looks
at
him
that
he
vouchsafed
but
for
a
moment
like
a
soft
cat
that
has
all
the
nature
of
the
rabbit
except
the
tiger
glare
the
vehicle
was
an
old
wagon
without
springs
and
levin
seat
was
a
piece
of
board
while
hulda
had
a
back
to
it
and
the
captain
had
padded
it
with
a
robe
he
looked
with
the
most
delicate
attention
at
hulda
blushed
when
she
looked
at
him
and
scarcely
noticing
the
horses
yet
having
them
under
nearly
automatic
control
he
drove
out
of
patty
cannon
lane
and
turned
into
the
woods
levin
cast
one
long
prying
look
at
johnson
tavern
wishing
he
might
have
the
gift
to
see
through
its
planking
and
tall
blank
roof
and
then
he
watched
the
road
of
hard
sand
or
piney
litter
with
here
and
there
a
or
long
puddly
rut
in
it
unravel
like
a
ribbon
behind
the
wheels
among
the
thick
pines
he
also
observed
the
skill
with
which
the
captain
threw
his
long
cowhide
whip
a
mere
strip
of
rawhide
fastened
to
a
stick
awkward
in
other
hands
but
van
dorn
could
brush
a
fly
from
either
of
the
short
shaggy
delaware
horses
with
it
and
hardly
look
where
he
struck
or
disturb
the
horse
and
he
could
deliver
a
blow
with
it
by
mere
sleight
that
made
the
animal
stagger
and
tremble
with
the
abrupt
pain
at
a
little
sandy
rill
the
only
one
they
crossed
a
long
endeavored
to
escape
before
the
rapid
wagon
could
strike
it
but
the
captain
rose
to
his
feet
quick
and
and
projected
the
long
lash
into
the
roadside
and
the
snake
writhed
and
bounded
in
the
air
almost
cut
in
two
then
sitting
again
and
bending
so
close
to
hulda
that
his
long
downy
mustache
of
gold
touched
her
cheek
van
dorn
said
softly
hermoso
young
let
me
take
a
snake
out
of
your
path
also
which
one
captain
it
does
not
matter
name
any
one
alas
said
hulda
i
am
of
them
how
can
i
wish
harm
to
my
stepfather
and
my
they
are
not
what
i
wish
but
i
am
commanded
to
honor
them
by
whom
fair
hulda
by
god
i
read
it
in
the
book
after
i
heard
it
from
a
slave
está
what
slave
that
we
know
was
so
poor
drunken
dave
he
was
a
good
man
before
he
knew
us
he
told
me
all
the
commandments
for
a
drink
of
brandy
and
i
wrote
them
down
and
afterwards
i
found
them
in
a
book
chito
how
graceful
is
your
mind
hulda
it
comes
out
of
the
absolute
blank
of
your
condition
and
discovers
things
as
the
young
osprey
untaught
before
knows
where
to
dive
for
fish
who
that
ever
comes
to
johnson
brings
the
bible
colonel
mclane
he
the
crocodile
he
gave
you
the
book
yes
he
told
me
joe
and
grandma
were
good
people
good
people
i
think
he
called
it
but
he
said
you
believed
nothing
and
there
was
no
basis
i
think
he
called
it
for
good
in
you
hala
hala
but
this
is
good
the
captain
softly
remarked
stroking
his
golden
mustache
with
the
hand
that
carried
the
lustrous
ring
patty
cannon
may
be
saved
i
must
be
damned
and
allan
mclane
will
sit
in
judgment
no
i
believe
nothing
because
such
as
they
believe
that
is
why
nobody
likes
you
hulda
frankly
observed
agreeable
as
you
are
and
can
you
believe
in
anything
after
the
surroundings
of
your
childhood
touching
crime
like
the
that
grows
among
the
the
lily
can
not
help
it
and
is
just
as
white
as
if
it
grew
under
glass
because
because
the
lily
has
none
of
the
blood
of
the
snake
the
captain
lisped
do
you
enter
that
claim
no
said
hulda
i
know
i
am
born
from
wicked
parents
a
daughter
of
crime
my
father
hanged
my
mother
of
dreadful
origin
but
never
have
i
felt
that
god
held
me
accountable
for
their
works
if
i
kept
my
heart
humble
and
my
hands
from
sin
and
never
have
i
been
tempted
yet
from
within
my
own
nature
to
enjoy
a
single
moment
of
such
hideous
selfishness
and
i
thank
my
kind
maker
that
something
to
love
and
believe
in
though
unhappy
as
myself
has
come
down
the
sad
pathway
i
looked
along
so
many
years
and
found
me
waiting
for
him
without
reply
the
captain
kept
his
own
thoughts
for
several
minutes
and
finally
sighed
i
know
one
thing
in
which
i
might
believe
pretty
child
oh
then
embrace
it
hulda
said
and
give
your
faith
a
single
straw
to
cling
to
van
dorn
hand
slipped
around
her
waist
and
his
florid
cheeks
and
blue
eyes
bent
beneath
her
leghorn
hat
i
find
it
here
perhaps
hulda
shall
i
embrace
your
youth
with
my
strong
passion
i
fear
i
love
you
yes
she
answered
looking
up
with
her
eyes
of
such
entrancing
gray
kiss
me
if
it
will
give
you
hope
the
blush
and
high
color
went
out
of
his
face
as
he
stared
into
those
passive
large
gray
orbs
wide
open
beneath
his
pouting
rich
effeminate
lips
and
as
he
hesitated
hulda
repeated
kiss
me
if
it
will
make
you
hope
no
no
he
answered
of
all
places
i
am
most
hopeless
i
knew
you
would
not
kiss
me
hulda
said
with
a
tone
above
him
if
i
gave
you
the
right
for
any
pure
object
the
kiss
would
give
me
does
not
see
its
mate
in
my
soul
you
hate
me
then
said
van
dorn
no
i
pity
you
i
pray
for
you
too
for
me
what
interest
have
you
in
me
i
do
not
know
said
hulda
i
have
often
wondered
what
made
me
think
of
you
so
often
and
yet
never
with
admiration
you
are
the
only
person
here
who
appears
to
have
lost
something
by
being
here
some
portion
of
you
seems
to
have
disappeared
i
have
felt
that
you
might
have
been
a
gentleman
though
you
can
never
be
again
i
shrink
from
you
and
still
i
pity
you
but
with
all
your
handsome
ways
i
would
never
love
you
while
the
poor
boy
who
is
riding
with
us
i
loved
as
soon
as
he
came
chito
you
can
shrink
from
me
and
not
from
a
cannon
too
why
girl
you
have
put
him
in
my
power
i
have
been
in
your
power
for
a
long
time
captain
van
dorn
and
you
have
looked
at
me
with
bold
and
evil
eyes
many
a
time
but
never
came
nearer
when
i
gaze
at
you
as
i
did
just
now
you
fly
from
me
that
boy
i
love
is
as
safe
as
i
am
in
your
hands
why
dear
presumer
tell
me
because
i
love
him
and
you
require
my
pity
as
long
as
you
protect
that
poor
orphan
boy
i
shall
carry
your
name
to
god
for
pardon
if
you
ever
do
him
harm
my
prayers
for
you
will
be
dumb
forever
aymé
aymé
softly
laughed
van
dorn
his
blush
not
coming
now
you
forget
hulda
that
i
believe
in
nothing
they
had
hardly
gone
four
miles
when
a
little
town
of
small
square
houses
strewn
about
like
between
pairs
of
red
outside
chimneys
sat
in
the
soft
humid
october
morning
along
the
rim
of
a
marshy
creek
that
skirting
the
hamlet
flowed
into
the
nanticoke
river
a
few
miles
by
its
course
above
twiford
wharf
two
streets
formed
by
two
roads
ended
in
a
third
street
along
the
sandy
flattish
river
shore
and
there
stood
four
or
five
larger
dwellings
like
their
humbler
neighbors
built
of
wood
but
with
bolder
greater
chimneys
rising
into
the
air
as
if
in
rivalry
of
four
large
ships
and
brigs
that
lay
at
anchor
or
beside
the
two
wharves
and
threw
their
masts
and
spars
into
the
sailing
clouds
making
the
low
forest
that
closed
river
and
village
in
stoop
to
its
humility
but
the
beautiful
river
with
frequent
bluffs
of
sand
and
woods
flowing
two
hundred
yards
wide
in
stately
tide
and
bearing
up
to
cannon
ferry
and
pungies
yankee
schooners
and
woodscows
and
the
signs
of
life
however
lowly
that
floated
in
blue
smoke
from
many
hearths
or
sounded
in
oars
rigging
and
lading
seemed
to
hulda
human
joy
and
power
and
she
cried
to
levin
levin
oh
look
did
you
ever
see
as
big
a
place
as
this
yonder
is
the
road
to
seaford
just
as
far
as
we
have
come
the
big
ships
are
taking
corn
for
west
indies
and
bringing
sugar
and
molasses
that
is
the
ferry
scow
and
on
the
other
side
it
is
only
five
miles
to
laurel
do
you
like
to
travel
that
road
asked
the
captain
with
his
pleasing
lisp
and
blush
returned
again
it
makes
me
sad
replied
hulda
but
i
do
not
mutter
when
i
go
past
the
spot
like
grandma
what
spot
asked
levin
where
father
killed
the
traveller
hulda
said
he
died
shamefully
for
it
you
could
almost
see
the
place
but
for
yonder
woods
where
the
road
to
laurel
climbs
the
sandy
hill
what
this
said
van
dorn
seeing
a
little
crowd
around
one
of
the
cabins
and
turning
his
team
into
the
parallel
street
a
very
tall
man
towered
above
the
rest
and
seemed
unable
to
stand
upright
in
the
low
cottage
with
his
proportions
so
that
he
took
his
place
on
the
grassy
sand
without
and
gave
his
directions
to
some
one
within
levy
on
the
simplify

your

had
the
equivalent

van
dorn
looked
on
and
saw
a
come
out
of
the
door
and
a
little
wool
in
a
bag
after
it
jacob
cannon
put
his
foot
on
the
wheel
and
poked
his
head
in
the
door

an

and
a
there
constable
levy
onto
with

stultos
pass
out
that
pair
of
shoes
a
voice
of
a
woman
crying
was
heard
and
van
dorn
and
levin
both
leaped
out
to
look
hulda
also
stepped
down
and
disappeared
a
woman
barely
able
to
stand
up
and
white
as
illness
and
anguish
could
make
her
had
staggered
to
the
door
to
beg
that
her
shoes
be
given
back
and
pointed
to
her
naked
feet
now
she
off
the

the
poor
woman
looking
around
on
the
naked
cabin
where
neither

nor

nor

nor
remained

it
was
thrown
in

miscellaneous
heap
at

a
boy
with
his
face
scratched
and
dissipation
settled
in
it
bounded
suddenly
into
the
aghast
group
of
spectators
and
made
a
vicious
dive
to
recover
the
effects
around
jacob
cannon
feet
but
that
mighty
worthy
took
him
by
the
collar
and
holding
him
up
dropped
him
over
a
fence
like
a
bug
owen
daw

assault
actionable
as

note

shouted
the
young
bully
of
johnson
and
late
distrainer
on
the
profile
of
cyrus
james
esquire
seizing
an
ugly
stick
justifiable
as
assault
remarked
the
creditor
carelessly
as
he
wrenched
the
bobbin
from
the
and
knocked
the
boy
down
with
it
his
commanding
manner
and
the
ready
hand
operated
to
abash
the
latter
and
deeply
pained
with
the
scene
levin
dennis
fervently
and
impulsively
cried
to
van
dorn
oh

her
debts

give
all
joe

it
van
dorn
feeling
levin
hands
grasp
his
own
with
simple
confidence
heard
and
did
not
turn
his
head
while
blushes
like
roses
bloomed
successively
upon
his
fresh
effeminate
cheeks
he
did
not
repel
the
boy
hands
however
but
looked
at
the
scene
with
worldly
and
unpitying
curiosity
to
pay
the
distraints
of
isaac
and
jacob
cannon
he
murmured
softly
would
keep
a
poor
slaver
poor
you
must
grow
accustomed
to
such
cries
i
had
to
do
so
learn
to

jacob
cannon
answered
his
whitish
eyes
seeming
to
chuckle
to
the
bridge
of
his
nose
and
this

at

breast

chito
smiled
van
dorn
i
did
it
for
this
foolish
boy
i
pity
none
hulda
had
resorted
to
the
strand
or
river
street
of
cannon
ferry
where
there
were
two
storehouses
and
she
had
borrowed
quill
and
ink
and
written
a
letter
addressed
to
ellenora
dennis
princess
anne
somerset
county
maryland
saying
levin
your
son
is
near
this
place
against
his
will
among
dangerous
men
and
in
great
temptation
but
he
has
found
a
friend
in
one
week
this
friend
will
try
to
write
again
and
if
not
heard
from
seek
levin
dennis
at
johnson
this
letter
written
with
all
her
unproficient
speed
had
just
been
folded
wafered
and
endorsed
and
she
had
put
down
one
of
the
shillings
of
to
pay
the
postage
when
a
shadow
fell
upon
the
store
counter
and
the
letter
was
withdrawn
from
her
hand
van
dorn
stood
by
her
side
chito
es
posible

now

too
dangerous
he
looked
without
his
blush
at
the
shilling
she
was
putting
back
in
her
bosom
and
his
eye
was
cold
and
fierce
hulda
heart
sank
down
brother
isaac
cried
jacob
cannon
to
a
man
of
fine
lean
height
who
was
at
the
desk
a
man
a
little
shorter
than
jacob
and
not
so
much
of
a
king
in
appearance
but
with
the
same
whitish
eyes
dancing
around
the
bridge
of
his
nose
and
a
more
covert
and
thoughtful
brow
brother
isaac

van
dorn

unsatisfactory
to

jacob

the
eyes
of
the
elder
and
smaller
brother
endeavored
to
have
an
introduction
to
each
other
through
the
bridge
of
his
nose
oh
brother
jacob
he
chuckled
what
an
executive

the

the
marius
of

this
morning

about
to

effects
my
bailiff
seized
on
her
plough
as
security
for

comfort
brother
jacob

item
to

and
loss
gentlemen
said
van
dorn
i
recommend
you
not
to
be
charging
to
tenants
in
the
vicinity
of
johnson
it
an
unusual
item
and
we
are
raising
young
men
there
who
may
not
understand
it
captain
said
the
elder
cannon
chuckling
as
if
still
in
admiration
of
marius
subtlety
i
recollect
now
that
our
ferryman
brought
over
a
man
from
laurel
this
morning
with
some
news
a
woman
with
a
broken
shackle
reported
there
last
night
and
said
she
was
the
slave
of
daniel
custis
of
princess
anne
she
came
from
broad
creek
where
did
she
go
a
methodist
preacher
put
her
in
his
buggy
and
started
to
her
with
her
then
she
beat
the
wind
said
van
dorn
these
preachers
are
all
and
can
outswap
the
devil
ya
ya
i
must
see
to
this
he
strode
out
with
a
cold
eye
glanced
at
hulda
come
young
people
spoke
the
grand
head
of
jacob
cannon
to
levin
and
hulda
i
will
show
you
my
museum
he
led
the
way
to
a
warehouse
overhanging
the
river
and
unlocked
a
door
and
told
them
to
walk
carefully
till
they
could
see
in
the
dark
of
the
interior
levin
kept
hulda
hand
in
his
as
they
slowly
saw
emerge
from
the
shadows
a
great
variety
of
dissimilar
things
heaped
together
till
the
house
could
hardly
hold
the
vast
aggregate
of
pots
and
kettles
and
cradles
bedsteads
and
beds
harrows
and
ploughs
chairs
and
gridirons
rakes
and
hoes
silhouettes
and
quilts
of
calico
and
pillows
of
geese
feathers
fishermen
nets
and
oars
whatever
made
the
substance
of
living
in
an
old
country
without
minerals
and
manufactures
in
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
whare
did
you
git
em
sir
levin
asked
executed
of
said
the
warrior
head
and
stature
of
jacob
cannon
pounced
on
satisfied
judgments
upon
fa
we
call
this
peale
museum
number
two
or
the
variegated
quotient
all
these
things
taken
from
the
poor
asked
hulda
how
many
miseries
they
tell
cannon
said
levin
what
kin
you
do
with
people
wo
buy
they
just
to
pieces
we
keep
em
to
show
all
them
who
trespass
on
isaac
and
jacob
cannon
answered
marius
with
easy
grandeur
that
there
is
a
hulda
gray
eyes
with
a
look
of
more
than
childish
contempt
accompanied
her
words
i
should
think
you
would
fear
that
day
cannon
when
you
say
the
prayer
us
our
trespasses
as
we
forgive
those
who
trespass
against
us
the
wind
from
the
river
seemed
to
bend
the
old
warehouse
and
the
noise
it
made
through
the
chinks
and
around
the
corners
slightly
stirring
the
loosely
disposed
pile
of
cottage
and
hut
comforts
seemed
to
arouse
low
wails
among
these
as
when
they
were
torn
from
the
chimney
side
and
the
family
where
is
my
baby
the
cradle
seemed
to
say
that
i
received
and
rocked
warm
from
the
womb
of
pain
oh
i
am
hungry
for
his
little
smile
why
do
i
rest
my
busy
wheel
the
spinner
seemed
to
creak
when
i
know
my
children
are
without
stockings
who
keeps
me
here
idle
while
mother
asks
for
me
where
is
the
old
gray
head
sighed
the
feathers
sifting
in
the
breeze
from
a
broken
that
every
night
and
in
the
afternoons
dozed
on
our
bag
of
down
and
picked
us
over
once
a
year
and
said
her
prayers
in
us
oh
is
she
sleeping
on
the
cold
bare
floor
and
we
so
useless
the
pot
seethed
to
the
kettle
it
is
and
the
little
boys
are
crying
for
food
and
still
there
is
no
one
to
lift
me
on
the
crane
and
start
the
fire
beneath
me
what
will
they
think
of
me
they
gathered
around
so
many
years
and
watched
me
boil
and
poked
their
little
fingers
in
to
taste
the
stewing
meat
i
want
to
go
i
want
to
go
the
kettle
answered
to
the
pot
i
never
sung
since
the
constable
forced
me
from
grandmother
hand
and
robbed
her
of
the
cup
of
tea
the
old
quilt
of
many
squares
fluttered
in
the
draught
take
me
to
the
young
wife
who
sewed
me
together
and
showed
me
so
proudly
for
i
fear
she
is
since
her
young
husband
died
these
household
sounds
the
thrilled
young
lovers
standing
so
poor
and
on
the
brink
of
what
they
knew
not
seemed
to
hear
in
awe
and
drew
closer
to
each
other
like
young
eve
and
adam
in
the
great
wreck
of
paradise
and
at
the
voice

stepped
forth
into
the

light
of

walked
along
the
sandy
street
beneath
the
tall
locust
maple
and
ailanthus
trees
that
grew
in

along
the
front
yards
of

the
bachelor
whose

built
for

by

finally
the
old
low
dwelling
of
the
mother
of
the
cannons
opposite
which
was
the
ferry
wharf
and
van
dorn
talking
to
the
negro
ferryman
levin
said
pretty
hulda
not
sad
but
very
grave
this
noble
house
is
like
that
cannon
hollow
and
cold
he
lives
with
his
brother
isaac
and
keeps
his
own
dwelling
empty
and
locked
up
because
he
loved
money
too
much
to
find
a
wife
let
us
love
each
other
huldy
levin
said
it
is
all
we
got
it
is
all
there

to
get

love

answered
yes

levin
i

not

could
now
cross
in
the
i
would
do
it
i
must
go
back
with
you
as
captain
van
dorn
came
up
from
the
wharf
blushing
like
a
and
tapping
his
white
teeth
together
under
the
long
flax
of
his
mustache
his
attention
was
arrested
by
a
proclamation
pasted
on
a
post

moore
johnson
kidnapper
above
reward
will
be
paid
by
me
to

the
body
of

miscreant
that
he
may
be
brought
to
trial
in
joseph
watson
of
he
van
dorn
sighed
the
end
must
soon
be
near
now
young
people
come
as
they
passed
cannon
place
going
out
of
town
the
familiar
voice
of
jacob
was
heard
to
cry
owen
daw
escaped
brother
isaac
but
we
clap
it
to
him
on
a
bonis
i
never
take
my
eye
off
him
till
i
die
brother
jacob
what
an
executive
help
you
air
as
van
dorn
drove
the
horses
up
the
slight
ascent
in
the
rear
of
the
ferry
past
an
ancient
double
puncheon
house
there
with
an
arch
in
the
centre
young
hulda
who
now
wore
shoes
and
stockings
and
a
presentable
dress
of
english
goods
and
looked
quite
the
woman
out
of
her
sincere
and
sometimes
proud
and
eloquent
eyes
said
to
him
as
she
pointed
back
captain
it
was
there
my
father
killed
the
traveller
where
we
see
the
road
beyond
the
ferry
enter
the
pines
yes
said
van
dorn
giving
her
a
cold
look
we
might
see
the
place
but
for
the
woods
it
is
at
a
hill
a
short
mile
from
the
nanticoke
tell
levin
about
it
captain
quedo
it
would
not
be
pleasant
yes
said
hulda
if
it
was
true
i
can
hear
it
i
want
levin
to
hear
it
too
so
that
no
deceit
shall
be
between
us
her
smooth
moist
hair
gray
humid
eyes
complexion
born
between
the
rose
and
dew
and
straight
lithe
figure
and
air
of
dignity
and
truth
impressed
van
dorn
curiously
how
bold
you
grow
can
not
you
stoop
to
me
i
too
would
live
without
deceit
but
i
will
not
tell
you
that
story
you
are
afraid
spoke
hulda
feeling
that
nothing
but
this
man
and
three
miles
of
level
road
separated
her
from
the
vengeance
of
patty
cannon
and
that
she
must
assert
herself
strongly
over
him
ya
are
you
not
harsh
remember
you
may
be
whipped
by
your
grandma
no
you
will
whip
me
or
kill
me
if
it
is
to
be
done
you
dare
not
give
me
to
her
to
punish
dare
not
again
why
because
you
are
my
guardian
between
us
is
an
instinct
different
from
love
but
strong
i
feel
it
i
lean
towards
you
but
not
on
you
what
is
it
dios
lisped
van
dorn
his
blush
suspended
and
his
warm
blue
eyes
fascinated
by
her
is
this
a
child
or
echo
tell
me
of
my
father
crime
i
want
levin
to
know
the
wretched
thing
he
has
affection
for
ah
well
listen
young
lovers
and
see
what
grisly
things
walk
in
these
pines
there
was
a
man
named
brereton
they
call
him
bruington
here
where
their
noses
are
twisted
and
their
chins
weak
he
came
from
old
lewes
off
to
the
east
by
cape
henlopen
and
of
a
stout
family
in
which
was
a
grain
of
evil
ever
smoking
through
the
blood
do
you
sometimes
feel
it
hulda
no
not
evil
like
that
he
was
apprenticed
to
a
blacksmith
and
held
the
iron
while
the
master
struck
one
day
a
man
came
in
the
shop
whose
horse
had
thrown
a
shoe
to
have
a
shoeing
and
when
he
paid
for
it
he
took
a
handful
of
money
from
his
pocket
and
one
piece
a
dollar
fell
in
the
soft
soot
of
the
shop
unperceived
but
by
the
boy
he
covered
it
with
his
foot
van
dorn
firmly
covered
a
huge
fly
on
the
horse
ear
and
laid
it
dead
when
the
man
departed
the
boy
raised
his
foot
and
uncovered
the
dollar
his
master
said
boy
they
divided
the
stolen
dollar
jimmy
phoebus
says
the
fust
step
is
half
of
a
journey
levin
noted
the
blacksmith
boy
looked
avariciously
on
travellers
ever
after
who
might
possess
a
dollar
he
took
the
empty
shop
of
patty
cannon
first
husband
years
after
that
saint
died
and
worked
on
hobbles
clevises
and
chains
to
hold
the
kidnapped
articles
of
commerce
naturally
he
kidnapped
too
and
while
she
was
yet
a
child
patty
daughter
became
brereton
wife
bestowed
by
the
fond
appreciative
mother
master
levin
if
you
fall
into
his
path
brereton
daughter
may
be
bestowed
on
you
behold
her
in
hulda
i
ca
see
any
of
that
sin
in
hulda
captain
she
ai
even
ashamed
no
affirmed
hulda
looking
sincerely
at
van
dorn
it
is
too
true
to
make
me
ashamed
i
feel
as
if
god
hand
covered
me
like
the
silver
dollar
under
my
father
foot
because
he
let
me
survive
such
parents
as
she
spoke
she
took
one
of
the
silver
shillings
of
and
covered
it
with
her
hand
in
van
dorn
sight
van
dorn
spoke
on
rapidly
there
were
two
brothers
named
griffin
from
about
cambridge
in
maryland
spoiled
boys
who
had
taken
to
the
flesh
trade
and
they
stole
men
and
gambled
the
proceeds
away
and
brereton
was
their
leader
one
day
a
traveller
came
by
from
carolina
hunting
contraband
slaves
and
he
was
of
your
boastful
sort
and
dropped
the
hint
that
he
had
fifteen
thousand
dollars
on
his
body
to
be
invested
no
later
had
he
spoken
than
he
felt
his
folly
from
the
burning
eyes
around
him
and
watering
mouths
telling
him
to
sleep
there
and
slaves
would
be
fetched
so
he
started
in
a
fright
for
laurel
by
way
of
cannon
ferry
intending
to
deposit
his
money
or
make
them
deal
with
him
there
the
word
was
passed
to
brereton
by
his
wife
or
and
by
brereton
to
the
griffins
to
mount
and
intercept
the
gold
some
say
lisped
van
dorn
that
mistress
cannon
dressed
in
man
clothes
commanded
the
band
a
deep
chuckling
interest
like
the
sound
of
a
hidden
brook
attended
van
dorn
recital
and
he
was
blushing
like
a
girl
at
slabtown
a
nondescript
spot
a
mile
above
cannon
the
band
crossed
in
a
they
piled
brush
and
bent
down
saplings
in
the
traveller
road
where
he
should
almost
reach
the
brow
of
the
hill
in
his
buggy
and
when
the
fleshmonger
halted
at
the
obstacle
hola
they
let
him
have
it
on
both
sides
and
sent
icicles
to
his
heart
he
drew
a
pistol
but
in
a
dying
hand
cried
the
assassins
is
not
dead
his
horse
in
fright
at
bursting
firearms
in
the
evening
shades
leaped
the
brushy
barriers
and
galloped
to
laurel
and
delivered
there
an
effigy
down
whose
beard
the
red
dye
of
his
life
dripped
audibly
as
he
sat
stiff
in
death
in
the
buggy
his
name
was
only
guessed
how
happy
he
in
that
and
what
was
the
fate
of
the
murderers
hulda
asked
with
less
horror
than
levin
showed
three
of
them
were
arrested
one
of
the
griffins
exposed
his
brother
and
captain
brereton
these
two
died
on
the
gallows
at
georgetown
young
brereton
exerting
himself
under
the
noose
to
prevent
his
injudicious
comrade
saying
too
much
on
peerless
patty
cannon
and
her
fair
sisters
and
thinking
on
their
interests
more
than
on
this
living
child
ha
hulda
the
other
griffin
also
suffered
death
suggested
hulda
with
a
pale
unevasive
countenance
yes
your
fond
grandma
then
in
her
blazing
charms
drew
him
to
her
band
again
with
the
lure
of
widow
brereton
hand
he
killed
a
constable
to
recommend
himself
the
better
and
died
on
the
gallows
at
his
native
cambridge
hala
she
gave
your
mother
hulda
to
joe
johnson
next
to
wife
it
is
an
awful
story
levin
said
but
hulda
never
saw
it
i
can
remember
my
father
said
hulda
a
large
strong
man
with
a
slow
heavy
face
but
he
never
smiled
on
me
well
here
is
the
said
van
dorn
what
shall
i
do
with
this
letter
bad
read
it
if
you
will
or
take
this
english
shilling
and
post

van
dorn
shrank
back
rejecting
the
money
will
you
not
buy
it
back
hulda
he
whispered
with
love
never
you
may
pay
for
this
letter
this
night
with
your
life
or
modesty
you
dare
not
kill
me
hulda
said
you

chapter
xxviii
pacification
princess
anne
had
missed
for
several
days
some
conspicuous
citizens
such
as
daniel
custis
and
wife
captain
phoebus
levin
dennis
and
the
free
negro
samson
large
components
of
a
small
town
but
it
had
also
gained
what
everybody
admitted
to
be
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
place
except
vesta
milburn
the
tall
roguish
niece
of
meshach
milburn
whom
vesta
had
made
a
lady
of
in
externals
corrected
some
of
her
faults
such
as
the
sniffle
and
was
daily
teaching
her
the
mysteries
of
grammar
and
address
aided
by
the
rector
of
the
parish
whose
heart
was
roused
to
partial
animation
again
by
the
young
visitor
loyally
william
tilghman
had
pressed
his
friendship
on
husband
determined
to
like
him
and
finding
small
resistance
there
and
happily
no
suspicion
and
this
was
so
grateful
to
vesta
that
she
indulged
the
hope
that
her
cousin
and
late
lover
would
find
compensation
for
her
loss
in
rhoda
holland
love
came
easily
on
as
a
topic
of
talk
where
rhoda
with
her
unconventional
preference
for
that
subject
introduced
it
william
she
had
got
that
far
towards
the
inevitable
william
said
rhoda
one
evening
at
teackle
hall
as
they
sat
in
the
library
do
preachers
love
jus
like
other
folks
misc
somers
say
they
is
she
say
thar
was
a
preacher
down
yer
to
girdle
tree
hill
that
preached
the
was
to
happen
right
off
millennium
suggested
tilghman
maybe
so
misc
somers
call
it
i
thought
anyway
they
was
all
goin
to
rise
right
off
an
he
with
lord
sakes
they
had
frills
put
on
thar
to
rise
in
an
the
night
before
they
was
up
that
ar
scamp
run
away
with
a
widder
an
her
darter
jilted
the
widder
an
married
the
darter
an
they
could
rise
at
girdle
tree
hill
caze
the
preacher
thar
an
they
did
know
when
and
i
suppose
somers
tells
it
on
him
william
tilghman
added
that
she
do
now
was
you
ever
in
love
mr
william
i
have
been
thinking
rhoda
that
when
you
are
a
good
scholar
and
grandmother
and
you
grow
to
like
each
other
as
i
believe
you
will
i
might
fall
in
love
with
you
lord
sakes
me
loved
by
a
preacher
could
i
never
stay
home
from
the
preachin
but
then
to
hear
your
own
ole
man
away
at
the
other
gals
i
think
it
would
be
right
good
the
subject
had
now
gone
to
that
length
that
in
a
few
days
to
grandmother
tilghman
slight
indignation
rhoda
called
the
rector
william
and
he
answered
her
dear
rhoda
the
triple
widow
however
had
one
lane
to
her
consideration
up
which
the
artful
rhoda
strayed
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
gate
ajar
misc
tilghman
she
said
one
day
i
been
at
you
i
you
was
a
real
beauty
if
you
was
a
little
quar
nobody
would
see
you
was
a
ole
woman
now
i
was
a
belle
spoke
the
blind
old
lady
emphatically
general
john
eager
howard
said
he
would
rather
talk
with
me
than
hear
an
oration
from
fisher
ames
charles
carroll
of
carrollton
proposed
to
me
when
i
was
old
enough
to
be
your
grandmother
and
after
susan
decatur
the
commodore
widow
had
tried
in
vain
to
get
an
offer
from
him
said
i
is
this
another
declaration
of
independence
no
said
i
i
wo
reduce
the
last
signer
it
may
be
to
obedience
on
a
wife
going
blind
that
would
be
worse
slavery
than
george
the
third
he
said
i
was
a
spartan
widow
every
widow
i
ever
see
was
a
sparkin
widow
rhoda
naïvely
concluded
at
which
tilghman
had
to
join
in
the
laughter
and
there
was
no
evil
feeling
jack
wonnell
now
held
the
temporary
post
of
cook
and
woodchopper
at
teackle
hall
and
roxy
saw
him
every
day
sewed
his
tattered
clothing
up
put
the
germs
of
in
him
and
caused
vesta
to
say
to
her
husband
as
they
were
sitting
in
his
storehouse
parlor
one
afternoon
in
the
intermission
of
his
chill
and
sweat
such
rapid
changes
have
taken
place
here
milburn
that
they
have
disturbed
my
judgment
and
now
i
hardly
know
whether
my
oldest
prejudice
is
assured
as
i
see
that
white
man
the
happy
domestic
servant
of
my
pure
slave
girl
she
seems
to
have
no
greater
affection
than
pity
and
interest
for
him
while
he
is
made
more
of
a
man
by
his
undisguised
devotion
to
her
no
man
could
work
better
than
he
does
now
love
is
so
great
so
occult
the
husband
said
his
brown
eyes
searching
his
wife
face
over
that
its
combinations
have
centuries
left
to
run
before
they
shall
beat
every
prejudice
down
and
prove
in
spite
of
sin
and
dispersion
that
of
one
blood
are
all

nations

levin
no
patty
answered
a
voice
from
the
next
room
within
i
drunk
my
share
there
nothing
like
a
conservative
course
as
patty
put
her
head
into
this
inner
room
levin
dennis
seeing
a
window
open
at
his
elbow
threw
the
whole
of
his
liquor
over
his
shoulder
into
the
yard
and
smacked
his
lips
heartily
saying
good
ha
exclaimed
van
dorn
evidently
noticing
levin
deceit
smart
people
are
around
us
patty
beware
he
took
from
his
pocket
the
fateful
letter
and
glanced
at
its
endorsement
and
as
he
did
so
levin
heard
an
exclamation
in
the
yard
from
a
man
who
had
received
the
whole
of
the
apple
brandy
and
sugar
in
his
face
and
was
furious
but
as
soon
as
he
seemed
to
recognize
the
thrower
he
muttered
apologetically
by
smoke
and
pangymonum
too
when
levin
looked
at
van
dorn
again
the
blush
was
on
his
face
but
the
letter
had
disappeared
beware
of
the
conservative
course
colonel
lisped
van
dorn
except
when
generous
patty
makes
the
punch
for
she
holds
such
measure
of
it
that
she
does
not
see
our
infirmities
honey
cried
patty
cannon
to
levin
giving
him
an
affectionate
hug
have
ye
swallered
yer
liquor
so
smart
as
that
why
i
love
to
see
a
nice
boy
drink
but
no
more
for
him
now
the
captain
protested
two
such
will
make
him
fall
off
his
horse
patty
excelente
drinking
how
purty
the
captain
says
them
things
the
madam
cried
to
the
gentleman
within
maybe
he
a
mockin
his
ole
sweetheart
oh
van
dorn
if
i
thought
you
could
forget
me
i
would
kill
you
levin
noticed
the
rapid
temper
and
demoniac
face
of
this
not
unengaging
lady
as
she
spoke
her
whole
nature
turning
its
course
like
a
wheeling
bat
and
from
plausibility
to
an
instant
jealousy
and
then
to
a
dark
tide
of
awful
rage
took
but
a
thought
disparate
hala
o
he
van
dorn
lisped
sweetly
chucking
the
hostess
under
the
chin
but
i
do
love
to
see
thee
so
thou
charmer
of
my
life
never
will
i
desert
thee
patty
whilst
thou
can
suffer
her
dark
clouds
slowly
passed
away
as
levin
turned
from
the
place
but
her
small
head
and
abundant
raven
hair
showed
the
blood
troubled
to
the
roots
and
the
eyes
once
rich
with
midnight
depths
now
glazing
in
the
course
of
time
like
old
window
panes
by
age
searched
the
face
with
a
strange
fear
van
dorn
time
and
pleasure
can
not
kill
you
how
well
you
look
i
think
you
are
a
boy
to
be
ruined
again
every
time
you
love
me
you
blush
so
modestly
where
is
that
pot
of
color
you
paint
your
cheeks
with
even
before
whose
blushes
none
can
recollect
why
do
you
love
me
dios
said
van
dorn
i
love
thee
for
these
spells
of
splendor
dark
night
and
noonday
passion
the
alternations
of
earth
and
hell
that
eclipse
heaven
altogether
i
love
to
see
thee
fear
though
fearing
nothing
here
because
i
see
nothing
that
you
fear
beyond
the
grave
you
hate
this
boy
i
hate
him
worse
than
wrinkles
let
him
not
come
to
me
a
child
let
him
see
ghosts
long
as
he
lives
how

age

a
pore
coaster
named
jimmy
phoebus
joe
must
be
ready
for
a
quick
departure
the
captain
exclaimed
when
we
come
back
from
dover
it
is
a
bold
undertaking
and
the
whole
of
the
little
state
will
be
aroused
like
a
black
snake
uncoiling
in
pocket
the
woman
pointed
from
her
shoulder
towards
the
inner
room
and
spoke
even
lower
than
before
van
dorn
i
have
a
customer
for
negroes
no
for
huldy
he
shall
have
her
as
levin
dennis
stood
at
the
without
he
saw
a
strange
man
ploughing
in
the
farm
so
recently
deserted
by
his
hostess
for
the
gayer
the
afternoon
light
fell
on
the
sandy
fields
and
struck
a
polish
from
the
ploughshare
and
as
the
ploughman
passed
the
brambly
spot
again
the
buzzards
slowly
circled
up
as
if
to
protest
that
he
came
too
near
their

long
lean
servant
who

putting

long

and
bending
down

close
to
levin
eyes
and
whispered
looking
towards
the
field

turning
partly
and

over
the

of
the

it
consisted
of
about
twenty
persons
white

some
riding
mules
some
horses

there
was
one
wagon
in

the

been
driven
to

for

the
captain

called

the
captain
took
his
place
at
the
reins
his
picturesque
velvet
jacket
wide
hat
bright
hair
and
gay
shirt
thighings
belt
and
boots
deserving
all
patty
cannon
encomiums
as
he
made
a
polite
adieu
and
threw
his
whip
like
a
thunderbolt
and
a
cheer
rose
from
the
discarded
volunteers
loitering
about
the
tavern
as
he
drove
joe
johnson
and
levin
away
the
road
was
nearly
dead
level
for
five
miles
but
being
the
old
travelled
road
from
laurel
and
the
south
to
easton
and
pointing
towards
baltimore
numerous
farms
and
clearings
were
seen
and
alternated
with
the
dry
corn
and
wheat
patches
here
and
there
like
a
measure
of
gold
poured
upon
the
ground
the
yellow
ears
lay
in
the

to
become
the

meal
of

joe

popularity
was
everywhere
apparent
and
many
a
shout
was
given
of
good

to
ye

a
nigger
back
from
delaway
joe
do
be
too
hard
on

joe
van
dorn
was
too
far
above
the
comprehension
of
his
neighbors
or
indeed
of
anybody
to
be
familiarly
addressed
but
patty
cannon
man
was
the
term
of
injured
inferiority
towards
him
after
he
had
passed
at
federalsburg
they
crossed
the
branch
of
the
nanticoke
piercing
to
the
centre
of
delaware
state
and
saw
one
large
brick
house
of
colonial
appearance
dominating
the
little
wooden
hamlet
and
here
as
generally
within
the
maryland
line
hunting
negroes
was
the
lark
or
the
serious
occupation
of
many
an
idle
or
enterprising
fellow
who
trained
his
negro
scouts
like
a
setter
or
more
often
like
a
spaniel
and
crossed
the
line
on
appointed
nights
as
ardently
and
warily
as
the
white
trader
in
africa
takes
to
the
trails
of
the
interior
for
human
prey
joe
said
van
dorn
what
is
to
be
your
disposition
of
the

the
nigger
boxer

burn
him
alive
on

island
if
the
white
chap

too
pickle
to

he
ai

sus
it
is
boyish
to
burn
the

a
blow
from

too
a
dog
will
bite
you
if

lasso
him
no
nigger
can
knock
me
down
and
git

then
you
are
a
bad
trader
the
negro
price
is
all
the
negro
is
why
make
him
your
equal
by
hating
him
i
am
a
delaware

a
byway

the
north

levin
and
ride
by

the
captain
said
very
soon
and
he
lifted
levin
old
hat
from
his
head
and
looked
at
his
bright
hair
parted
in
the
middle
his
fine
large
eyes
needing
the
light
of
knowledge
and
his
soft
complexion
and
marks
of
good
extraction
where
is
thy
father
levin
to
let
thee
go
so
ragged
with
such
graceful

in

the
prophet
of

is
respectable

will
say
for
these
people
too
that
while

look
down
on
it
i
was
once
the
greatest
guest
in
timbo
housed
with
its
absolute
prince
attended
by
my
suite
looking
like
an
ambassador
and
he
called
me
son
and
drew
me
to
his
breast
proclamations
were
made
that
i
should
be
respected
as
such
yet
every
human
object
fled
before
me
as
i
rode
out
alone
to
see
the
gardens
and
cassava
fields
the
roaming
goats
and
oxen
and
the
rich
mountain
prospects
and
saw
the
girls
bathing
in
the
brooks
the
cry
went
round
is
coming
and
huts
were
deserted
fields
forsaken
the
gray
patriarchs
and
the
little
children
ran
and
i
was
left
alone
with
the
dumb
animals
despised
abhorred
do
they
have
slavery
thair
sir
yes
slavery
immemorial
yet
the
is
no
more
respectable
than
the
procurer
the
coin
of
africa
its
only
medium
was
the
slave
he
paid
the
debt
of
war
of
luxury
and
of
business
yet
the
soul
of
man
in
the
familiar
study
of
such
universal
slavery
grovels
with
it
and
points
to
bright
destiny
no
more
with
the
head
erect
i
died
in
africa
ai
you
in
the
business
now
sir
now
i
am
a
mere
forest
thief
and
bushman
levin
he
who
begins
a
base
trade
rises
early
to
its
fulness
and
in
subsequent
life
must
be
a
poor
wolf
rejected
from
the
pack
stealing
where
he
can
sneak
in
such
is
the
kidnapper
eking
out
the
decayed
days
of
the
slaver
such
is
the
ruined
voluptuary
living
at
last
on
the
earnings
of
some
shameless
woman
such
am
i
behold
me
van
dorn
eyes
turned
on
levin
in
their
cold
heartless
light
and
yet
he
blushed
as
usual
you
ought
to
be
a
gentleman
captain
what
made
you
break
the
laws
so
and
be
a
bad
man
mused
van
dorn
shall
i
tell
you
it
was
africa
i
was
a
youth
cool
and
bold
and
with
a
thread
of
pleasure
in
me
i
went
to
sea
in
a
manly
trade
and
fortune
being
slow
they
whispered
to
me
in
the
west
indies
that
my
clipper
was
just
the
thing
for
the
and
i
made
the
first
venture
out
of
virtue
which
is
all
the
voyage
in
africa
i
fell
a
prey
to
the
voluptuous
life
a
white
man
leads
there
to
which
the
very
missionaries
are
not
always
exceptions
young
pale
gentle
graceful
brave
my
blushes
instant
as
my
passions
the
ceaseless
intrigue
of
that
hot
climate
circled
around
me
like
a
dance
in
the
harem
around
the
young
intruder
i
forgot
my
native
land
and
every
obligation
in
it
i
was
enslaved
by
africa
to
its
swooning
joys
i
went
there
like
the
serpent
and
was
stung
by
the
woman
ai
they
all
right
black
and
ugly
in
africa
captain
the
world
has
not
the
equals
of
senegambia
for
beauty
said
van
dorn
the
fullah
beauties
are
often
almost
white
and
the
black
admixture
is
no
more
than
varnish
on
the
and
even
here
my
lad
where
civilization
builds
a
wall
of
social
fire
around
the
slave
you
often
mark
the
idolatry
of
the
white
head
to
captive
africa
did
you
make
money
for
some
years
i
did
plenty
of
it
but
degradation
in
the
midst
of
pleasure
weighed
down
my
spirits
the
thing
called
honor
had
flown
from
over
me
like
the
heavenly
dove
and
in
its
place
a
hundred
painted
birds
flocked
joyfully
the
dazzling
creatures
of
that
thoughtless
world
oh
that
i
could
have
been
born
there
or
never
have
seen
it
at
last
i
started
home
but
the
world
had
adopted
a
new
commandment
shalt
not
trade
in
man
they
took
my
ship
and
all
its
black
cargo
and
i
came
home
naked

from

by

drop
of
water

an

house
standing
in

with
a

faint
light
streaming
from
the
door
and
heard
the

judge
custis
whom
we
left
riding
out
of
princess
anne
on
sunday
afternoon
kept
straight
north
crossed
the
bottom
of
delaware
in
the
early
evening
and
went
to
bed
at
laurel
on
broad
creek
a
few
miles
south
of
cannon
ferry
at
daylight
he
was
ahorse
again
scarcely
stiff
from
his
exertion
and
feeling
the
rising
joys
of
a
stomach
and
brain
becoming
clearer
than
for
years
of
all
the
forms
of
alcohol
his
mind
had
been
bathed
in
sleep
and
temperance
the
two
great
physicians
and
wiped
dry
like
the
feet
of
the
prince
of
sufferers
with

exercise
natural
to
a
virginian
awakened
his
flowing
spirits
again
and
he
fancied
the
air
grew
purer
as
he
advanced
into
the
north
though
there
was
hardly
any
perceptible
change
of
elevation
the
country
grew
drier
however
as
he
turned
the
head
springs
of
the
great
cypress
swamp
the
counterbalance
of
the
dismal
swamp
of
virginia
receded
from
the
chesapeake
waters
and
approached
the
tributaries
of
the
atlantic
at
nine
he
entered
the
cluster
of
georgetown
a
little
place
of
a
few
hundred
people
pitched
nearly
at
the
centre
of
the
county
one
generation
before
or
about
ten
years
after
the
independence
of
the
country
it
was
a
level
place
of
houses
assembled
around
a
sandy
square
in
which
were
both
elm
and
italian
poplar
trees
and
a
wooden
was
on
the
farther
side
surrounded
by
little
cabins
for
the
county
officers
pitched
here
and
there
and
in
the
rear
was
a
jail
of
two
stories
with
family
apartments
below
and
the
dungeon
window
the
debtors
room
and
a
family
bedroom
above
and
near
the
jail
and
stood
the
like
a
dismantled
pump
with
a
pillory
floor
some
feet
above
the
ground
young
maples
mulberry
and
tulip
trees
and
ailanthuses
grew
bravely
to
make
shade
along
the
two
streets
which
pierced
the
square
and
the
four
streets
which
were
parallel
to
its
sides
pretty
lanes
being
inserted
between
to
which
the
loamy
gardens
ran
and
as
the
judge
stopped
at
the
tavern
near
the
court
he
was
told
it
was
returning
day
and
the
place
would
soon
be
filled
with
constituents
assembling
to
hear
how
she
gone
as
the

knew

ever
since

at

judge
custis
recognized
a
gentleman
opposite
wearing
smallclothes
and
with
his
hair
in
a
queue
who
spoke
without
other
than
a
passively
kind
expression
judge
ah
chancellor
the
chancellor
was
nearly
seventy
years
old
wearing
an
humble
meditative
yet
gracious
look
as
one
whose
relations
to
this
world
were
those
of
stewardship
and
whose
nearly
obsolete
dress
was
the
badge
not
of
worldly
pride
but
of
perished
joys
and
contemporaries
his
unaffected
countenance
seemed
to
say
i
wear
it
because
it
is
useless
to
put
off
what
no
one
else
will
wear
when
presently
i
shall
need
nothing
but
a
shroud
judge
custis
looked
at
the
meek
old
gentleman
closely
sitting
at
his
plate
like
a
lay
brother
in
some
monastery
or
infirmary
indifferent
to
talk
or
news
or
affairs
and
the
remembrance
of
what
he
had
been
keen
accumulative
with
youthful
passions
long
retained
and
the
man
buoyant
under
the
judge
guard
impressed
the
virginian
to
say
to
himself
what
then
is
man
at
last
old
age
asserts
itself
and
bends
the
brazen
temple
of
his
countenance
like
samson
in
almost
pious
remorse
there
sits
years
of
equity
administration
behind
it
thirty
years
of
jocund
and
various
life
no
newspaper
shall
ever
record
it
because
none
are
printed
here
he
is
indifferent
to
that
forgetfulness
and
to
all
others
because
the
springs
of
life
are
dry
in
his
body
and
he
no
more
enjoys
are
you
travelling
north
judge
custis
the
old
man
asked
for
politeness
sake
yes
to
dover
there
is
a
seat
in
my
carriage
you
are
welcome
to
it
i
will
take
it
a
part
of
the
way
at
least
to
feel
the
privilege
of
your
society
chancellor
the
old
man
gave
a
slow
sidewise
shake
of
his
head
too
late
too
late
he
said
to
flatter
me
i
was
fond
of
it
once
i
have
been
a
flatterer
too
the
chancellor
black
boy
was
put
on
the
judge
horse
and
the
two
men
in
a
plain
light
square
vehicle
turned
the
corner
for
the
north
as
they
passed
the
door
they
heard
the
sheriff
knock
off
two
slaves
to
a
purchaser
crying
your
property
sir
till
they
are
years
of
age
ha
ha
laughed
in
a
great
horse
laugh
a
nearly
chinless
villager
say
till
ole
patty
cannon
can
git
the
purchaser
gave
a
cunning
smile
at
the
passing
chancellor
whose
look
of
resignation
only
deepened
and
grew
more
humble
the
judge
had
some
vague
recollection
which
moved
him
to
change
the
subject
we
see
each
other
but
little
chancellor
though
we
divide
the
same
little
heritage
of
land
i
suppose
your
people
are
all
proud
of
delaware
yes
said
the
old
man
being
such
a
little
adventurer
a
mere
foundling
in
the
band
of
states
our
people
have
the
pride
of
their
independence
the
laws
are
administered
some
more
farms
are
opened
in
the
forest
every
year
blossoms
come
and
old
men
die
and
are
buried
on
their
farms
and
their
bones
respected
a
few
years
our
history
is
so
pastoral
that
we
must
show
some
temper
when
it
is
assailed
or
we
might
let
out
our
ignorance
of
it
they
rode
in
silence
some
hours
through
an
older
settled
and
more
open
country
with
some
large
and
a
better
class
of
farm
improvements
and
the
sense
of
some
large
water
near
at
hand
was
mystically
felt
the
judge
followed
the
old
man
eyes
at
one
place
seeing
that
they
were
raised
with
an
expression
of
tranquil
satisfaction
like
aged
piety
and
a
beautiful
landscape
of
soft
green
marsh
lay
under
their
gaze
from
a
slight
elevation
they
had
reached
showing
cattle
and
sheep
roving
in
it
tall
groves
where
cows
and
horses
found
midday
shade
and
winding
creeks
carrying
sails
of
hidden
boats
as
if
in
a
magical
cruise
upon
the
velvet
verdure
haystacks
and
farm
settlements
stood
out
in
the
long
levels
and
sailing
birds
speckled
the
air
in
the
far
distance
lay
something
like
more
marsh
yet
also
like
the
clouds
it
is
the
delaware
bay
the
chancellor
said
they
soon
entered
a
little
town
on
a
navigable
creek
with
a
large
sawmills
several
vessels
building
on
the
stocks
and
an
air
of
superior
vitality
to
anything
judge
custis
had
seen
in
delaware
here
the
chancellor
pointed
out
the
late
home
of
senator
clayton
father
and
after
the
horses
had
been
fed
they
continued
still
northward
passing
another
small
town
on
a
creek
near
the
marshes
and
a
little
beyond
it
came
to
a
venerable
brick
church
a
little
from
the
road
in
a
grove
of
oaks
and
forest
trees
here
is
barrett
chapel
said
the
chancellor
celebrated
for
the
plotting
of
the
campaign
between
wesley
native
and
english
preachers
for
the
conquest
of
america
as
soon
as
the
crown
had
lost
it
they
looked
up
over
the
quakerly
edifice
with
its
broad
low
door
high
roof
double
stories
of
windows
and
a
higher
window
in
the
gable
trim
rows
of
over
door
and
windows
and
belt
masonry
and
heard
the
tall
trees
hush
it
to
sleep
like
a
baby
left
to
them
nearly
fifty
feet
square
and
probably
fifty
years
old
it
looked
to
be
good
for
another
hundred
years
my
family
in
accomac
was
harsh
with
the
methodists
through
a
mistaken
conservatism
judge
custis
said
they
are
a
good
people
they
seem
to
suit
this
peninsula
like
the
peachtree
a
small
funeral
procession
was
turning
into
barrett
chapel
and
the
chancellor
interrogated
one
of
the
more
indifferent
followers
as
to
the
dead
person
having
mentioned
the
name
the
citizen
said
his
death
was
mysterious
he
was
a
methodist
and
a
good
man
but
it
seems
that
avarice
was
gnawing
his
principles
away
a
slave
boy
soon
to
become
free
by
law
disappeared
from
his
possession
and
he
gave
it
out
that
the
boy
had
run
away
but
suddenly
our
neighbor
began
to
drink
and
to
display
money
and
they
say
he
had
the
boy
kidnapped
he
died
like
one
with
an
attack
of
despair
as
they
turned
again
northward
in
the
genial
afternoon
judge
custis
said
what
a
stigma
on
both
sides
chancellor
is
this
kidnapping
the
old
man
meekly
looked
down
and
did
not
reply
judge
custis
feeling
that
there
was
some
sensitiveness
on
this
and
kindred
subjects
yet
why
he
could
not
recollect
continued
under
the
impulse
of
his
feelings
the
night
before
i
left
princess
anne
joe
johnson
one
of
your
worst
kidnappers
boldly
came
to
my
house
for
lodging
why
i
let
him
stay
there
is
a
subject
of
wonder
and
contempt
to
myself
but
there
he
was
perhaps
when
i
came
away
not
a
prudent
thing
to
permit
the
old
man
groaned
i
knew
his
wife
was
the
widow
of
a
gallows
bird
one
brereton
the
name
is
yankee
he
was
hanged
for
highway
robbery
a
muffled
sound
escaped
the
sober
old
gentleman
of
delaware
should
remember
the
murder
chancellor
it
happened
in
this
state
this
brereton
killed
a
for
what
he
brought
here
upon
his
person
to
buy
the
kidnapped
free
people
and
brereton
was
the
of
patty
cannon
that
infamous
pander
between
delaware
and
the
south
the
old
chancellor
looked
up
i
wish
to
anticipate
you
he
said
in
what
you
might
further
say
with
truth
but
perhaps
do
not
fully
know
the
murderer
brereton
was
the
of
patty
cannon
it
is
true
but
he
was
also
the
of
myself
impossible
judge
custis
said
yes
sir
i
married
his
sister
the
old
chancellor
again
turned
his
eyes
to
the
ground
great
heavens
exclaimed
the
judge
how
many
curious
things
can
be
in
such
a
little
state
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
that
judge
daniel
custis
rode
into
a
small
town
on
an
undulating
plain
around
two
sides
of
which
at
hardly
half
a
mile
distance
ran
a
creek
through
a
pretty
wooded
valley
and
a
third
side
was
bounded
by
a
branch
of
the
same
creek
all
winding
through
copse
and
marsh
to
the
delaware
bay
at
the
centre
of
the
town
on
the
swell
or
crest
of
alluvial
soil
of
a
light
sandy
loam
foundation
an
oblong
public
square
divided
by
a
north
and
south
street
contained
the
principal
dwellings
of
the
place
one
of
which
was
the
delaware
state
capitol
a
building
a
little
older
than
the
american
constitution
with
a
cupola
above
its
centre
and
thence
could
be
seen
the
delaware
bay
near
the
stood
the
in
the
corner
humble
as
a
and
the
brick
jail
hid
out
of
the
way
there
also
like
an
unpresentable
servant
ever
cringing
near
his
master
company
various
buildings
generally
antique
surrounded
this
prim
quakerly
square
some
brick
and
with
low
portals
others
smart
and
remodelled
to
suit
the
times
some
were
mere
wooden
offices
or
huts
with
long
dormers
falling
from
the
nearly
to
the
eaves
like
a
dingy
feather
from
a
with
a
jewel
in
the
end
and
one
was
an
old
hotel
painted
yellow
with
a
long
lounging
side
at
diagonal
corners
of
this
square
as
far
apart
as
its
space
would
permit
two
venerable
doctors
homes
still
stood
which
had
given
more
repute
to
delaware
little
capital
than
its
jurists
or
statesmen
the
former
residence
of
sykes
the
surgeon
and
miller
the
pathologist
and
writer
it
was
at
the
former
of
these
houses
a
tall
house
of
plastered
brick
with
side
office
and
centre
door
that
judge
custis
stopped
and
hitched
his
horse
to
a
rack
near
the
adjoining
the
sound
of
twittering
birds
fell
from
the
large
elms
willows
and
maples
on
the
square
and
custis
could
see
the
robins
running
in
the
grass
from
the
door
of
the
side
office
the
sound
of
a
violin
came
tenderly
and
the
judge
waited
until
the
tune
was
done
when
loud
exclamations
of
pleasure
the
clapping
of
hands
and
the
stamping
of
feet
showed
that
the
fiddler
was
not
alone
presenting
himself
at
the
door
judge
custis
was
immediately
confronted
by
a
large
tall
man
fully
six
feet
high
with
a
strong
countenance
and
sandy
hair
who
carried
the
fiddle
and
bow
in
his
hand
and
with
the
other
hand
seized
judge
custis
almost
affectionately
and
drew
him
in
crying
why
how
is
my
old
friend
goy
how
does
he
do
who
could
have
expected
you
on
this
simple
occasion
sit
down
there
and
take
my
own
chair
not
that
little
one
no
the
big
for
my
old
friend
goy
as
judge
custis
cast
his
eye
around
to
note
the
company
the
demonstrative
host
with
a
flash
of
his
eyes
whispered
who
is
he
who
is
he
a
custis
whispered
a
person
hardly
the
better
off
for
his
drams
i
reckon
he
is
by
the
lips
and
skin
goy
rapidly
spoke
the
fiddler
friend
custis
i
know
my
heart
does
not
deceive
me
let
me
introduce
you
to
the
very
essence
of
grand
old
little
delaware
here
is
bob
frame
the
ardent
spirit
of
our
bar
this
is
james
bayard
our
misguided
democratic
favorite
here
is
charley
marim
and
secretary
harrington
and
my
esteemed
friend
senator
ridgely
and
my
cousin
clayton
we
are
all
here
and
all
honored
by
such
a
rare
guest
goy
as
the
judge
went
through
the
process
the
tall
host
stooped
to
the
convivial
person
again
and
with
his
hand
to
the
side
of
his
mouth
and
an
air
of
solemn
cunning
whispered
where
from
accomac
or
somerset
i
reckon
muttered
the
other
now
exclaimed
the
host
taking
both
of
judge
custis
hands
how
do
our
dear
friends
all
get
along
in
somerset
and
accomac
where
you
call
home
now
friend
custis
how
are
our
old
friends
spence
and
upshur
and
polk
and
franklin
and
harry
wise
goy
how
i
love
our
neighbors
below
there
was
a
strength
of
articulation
and
physical
emphasis
in
the
speaker
that
the
judge
noted
at
once
and
it
was
attended
with
a
beaming
of
the
eyes
and
a
fine
fortitude
of
the
large
jaws
that
made
him
nearly
magnetic
and
this
is
john
m
clayton
said
the
judge
we
are
not
so
far
off
that
we
have
not
fully
heard
of
you
and
now
since
i
belong
to
a
numerous
family
let
me
identify
myself
clayton
as
daniel
custis
late
judge
on
the
eastern
shore
judge

daniel
custis
friends
looking
around
what
an

eminent
american
manufacturer

creator
of
our
industries
the
friend
of
clay
and
the
home
policy
bayard
you
need
not
shake
your
head
ridgely
pardon
my
patriotic
enthusiasm
look
at
my
friends
at
last
goy
as
the
judge
listened
to
various
affirmations
of
welcome
clayton
with
one
eye
winked
and
the
other
resting
on
lawyer
frame
the
ardent
spirit
of
the
bar
made
the
motion
with
his
lips
cambridge
no
princess
anne
and
dear
old
princess
anne
how
does
she

he
had
again

judge

came
to
dover
to
be
acquainted
with
mr
clayton
braner
hyo
come
yer
aunt
the
host
cried
loudly
and
an
old
colored
woman
came
in
closely
followed
by
some
of
her
grandchildren
who
stood
gazing
at
the
door
take
this
gentleman
and
give
him
the
best
room
in
my
house

best

best
julep
in
kent
county
goy
de
bes
room
was
miss
sally
clayton
the
old
woman
answered
a
sudden
change
came
over
the
highly
prompt
and
sanguine
face
of
the
host
he
hesitated
wandered
in
the
eyes
and
caught
himself
on
the
words
no
give
him
the
speaker
chew
room
that
suit
him
best
as
the
judge
followed
the
servant
out
the
young
senator
emptied
his
mouth
of
a
large
piece
of
tobacco
into
a
monster
spittoon
that
a
blind
man
could
hardly
miss
and
with
a
face
still
long
and
silent
and
much
at
variance
with
his
previous
spontaneity
he
absently
inquired
what
can
he
want
what
can
he
want
one
of
the
small
negro
children
had
meantime
toddled
in
at
the
door
and
with
large
liquid
eyes
in
its
solemn
desirous
face
laid
hands
on
the
fiddle
and
looked
up
at
clayton
bless
the
little
child
he
suddenly
said
wants
a
tune
well
placing
himself
in
a
large
chair
the
young
senator
tilted
it
back
till
his
hard
squarish
head
rested
against
the
mantel
and
he
felt
along
the
strings
almost
purposelessly
till
the
plaintive
air
came
forth
ye
banks
and
braes
o
bonnie
doon
how
can
ye
bloom
so
fair
how
can
ye
chant
ye
little
birds
and
i
so
full
of
care
break
my
heart
thou
bonnie
bird
that
sings
beside
thy
mate
for
so
i
sat
and
so
i
sang
and
wist
not
of
my
fate
he
closed
his
eyes
on
the
strains
and
a
thickening
at
his
throat
and
movement
of
his
broad
athletic
chest
as
he
continued
the
air
showed
that
he
was
inwardly
laboring
with
some
strong
emotion
his
cousin
the
made
a
signal
with
his
hat
and
one
by
one
the
sitters
stole
out
into
the
square
noiselessly
and
went
their
ways
leaving
the
young
man
playing
on
with
the
negro
child
at
his
knee
leaning
there
as
if
to
spy
out
the
living
voice
in
his
violin
other
children
came
to
the
door
white
children
from
the
square
black
children
from
the
garden
and
some
ventured
a
little
way
in
to
hear
the
tender
wooing
of
the
sympathetic
strings
he
moved
his
bow
mechanically
but
the
music
sprang
forth
as
if
it
knew
its
sister
grief
was
waiting
on
the
chords
at
last
a
bolder
child
than
the
rest
came
and
pushed
his
elbow
and
said
papa
my
boy
my
dear
boy
the
fiddler
cried
as
tears
streamed
down
his
cheeks
and
he
lifted
the
lad
to
his
heart
and
kissed
him
judge
custis
though
no
word
passed
upon
the
subject
saw
the
solitary
canker
at
the
senator
heart
his
wife
dead
form
in
the
old
presbyterian
it
was
soon
apparent
to
judge
custis
from
this
and
other
silent
things
that
a
affectionate
strong
yet
womanly
engine
of
energy
constituted
the
young
delaware
keen
cunning
impulsive
hopeful
his
feet
provincial
his
head
among
the
birds
he
combined
facility
and
earnestness
in
almost
mercurial
relations
to
each
other
and
the
judge
saw
that
these
must
constitute
a
remarkable
jury
lawyer
his
face
was
shaven
smooth
his
throat
and
chin
showed
an
early
tendency
to
flesh
the
poise
of
his
head
and
thoughtful
darting
of
his
eyes
and
slight
aqualinity
of
his
nose
indicated
one
who
loved
mental
action
and
competition
yet
drew
that
love
from
a
great
healthy
body
that
had
to
be
watched
lest
it
relapse
into
indolence
the
loss
of
his
wife
so
soon
after
marriage
had
been
followed
by
nearly
complete
indifference
to
women
and
he
had
made
politics
his
only
consolation
and
mistress
harnessing
her
like
a
young
mare
with
his
old
roadster
of
the
law
and
driving
them
together
in
the
slender
confines
of
his
principality
and
then
locking
the
law
up
among
his
office
students
to
drive
politics
into
the
national
arena
at
washington
you
require
to
be
very
neighborly
clayton
in
a
small
bailiwick
like
this
the
judge
inquired
as
they
strolled
along
the
square
in
the
soft
evening
we
have
the
best
people
in
the
world
in
delaware
friend
custis
few
traders
little
law
scarcely
any
violence
and
they
are
easy
to
please
but
it
is
a
high
offence
in
this
state
not
to
be
what
is
called
clever
man
you
must
stop
whatever
be
your
errand
and
smile
and
inquire
of
every
man
at
his
gate
for
every
individual
member
of
his
household
the
time
lost
in
such
kind
trifling
intercourse
is
in
the
aggregate
immense
but
goy
i
do
love
these
people
it
seems
to
me
that
you
encourage
that
exaction
well
i
do
as
an
electioneerer
i
can
get
away
with
any
of
goy
why
jim
whitecar
lord
bless
your
dear
soul
this
addressed
to
a
sandy
man
who
was
about
retreating
into
the
capitol
tavern
what
brings
you
to
town
jim
it
a
free
country
i
reckon
exclaimed
the
man
goy
that
so
jimmy
we
all
glad
to
see
you
in
dover
behaving
of
yourself
jim
now
do
give
me
any
trouble
this
year
friend
jimmy
behave
yourself
and
be
an
honor
to
your
good
parents
that
i
think
so
much
of
oblige
me
now
as
they
turned
to
cross
the
middle
of
the
square
clayton
said
i
have
him
at
that
hugging
of
it
one
of
these
days
what
is
he
a
kidnapper
down
here
in
sockum
and
a
bad
one
a
dangerous
fellow
too
i
hear
he
says
if
i
ever
push
him
to
the
extremity
of
his
joe
johnson
whom
i
sent
to
the
post
and
then
saved
from
cropping
that
he
kill
me
goy
mr
clayton
looked
around
a
trifle
apprehensively
i
ready
for
him
delaware
kidnapping
is
a
great
institution
custis
said
it
has
an
antiquity
and
extent
you
would
hardly
believe
friend
custis
long
before
our
independence
in
the
year
the
statutes
of
delaware
had
to
provide
against
it
our
laws
have
never
permitted
the
domestic
with
other
states
the
little
place
seemed
to
have
a
good
society
and
the
beauty
of
the
young
girls
sitting
at
the
doors
or
walking
in
the
evening
showed
something
of
the
florid
north
europe
skins
batavian
eyes
and
rotund
dutch
or
quaker
figures
as
they
returned
to
the
public
square
a
room
in
the
tavern
almost
brilliantly
lighted
for
that
day
of
candles
displayed
its
windows
to
the
gaze
of
clayton
who
exclaimed
goy
that
is
surely
john
randel
junior
that
distinguished
engineer
observed
his
visitor
who
had
been
waiting
all
the
evening
to
broach
the
subject
of
his
errand
i
have
the
greatest
admiration
of
him
shall
we
call
on
him
why
yes
yes
answered
clayton
dubiously
i
not
afraid
of
him
i
goy
i
owe
him
nothing
he
is
such
a
litigious
fellow
though
so
persistent
with
it
mad
incorrigibility
he
the
wildest
man
of
genius
alive
but
come
on
knocking
at
a
door
on
the
second
floor
a
sharp
prompt
reply
came
out
come
a
man
with
a
large
head
and
broad
shoulders
and
cloth
leggings
buttoned
to
above
his
knee
sat
in
a
nearly
naked
carpetless
room
writing
his
table
surrounded
by
burning
wax
candles
and
his
countenance
was
proud
and
intense
clayton
rushed
upon
him
and
seized
his
hand
how
is
my
friend
randel
the
indefatigable
litigant
the
brilliant
engineer
to
whom
ideas
goy
are
like
persimmons
on
the
tree
abundant
but
seldom
ripe
and
only
good
when
frosted
how
is
he
now
and
what
is
he
at
stand
there
spoke
the
engineer
and
look
at
me
while
i
read
the
sentence
i
was
finishing
upon
john
middleton
clayton
of
delaware
go
it
randel
now
custis
he
put
a
wick
in
me
and
just
set
me
afire
goy
is
the
curse
of
lawyers
the
unrelaxing
stranger
read
let
their
judgment
for
hire
from
early
manhood
to
easy
clients
or
to
suppress
it
in
the
cringing
necessities
of
popular
politics
hence
that
residue
and
fruit
of
all
talents
the
honest
conviction
of
a
bravest
sagacity
perishes
in
lawyers
souls
ere
half
their
powers
are
fledged
they
become
the
registers
of
other
men
they
think
no
more
than
wax
here
randel
blew
out
one
of
the
candles
the
illustration
was
cogent
clayton
lighted
it
again
with
another
candle
there
method
in
his
madness
custis
he
said
with
a
wink
let
me
introduce
my
great
friend
to
you
randel
stop
there
the
engineer
repeated
sternly
till
i
have
read
my
sentence
it
is
that
a
lawyer
of
useful
parts
in
a
community
as
detached
and
pastoral
as
the
state
of
delaware
has
a
cause
appealing
to
his
manliness
his
genius
and
his
avarice
like
this
of
john
randel
junior
civil
engineer
no
equal
public
work
will
probably
be
built
in
the
state
of
delaware
during
the
lifetime
of
the
said
clayton
no
fee
he
can
earn
in
his
native
state
will
ever
have
been
the
reward
of
a
lawyer
there
like
his
who
shall
be
successful
with
the
suit
of
john
randel
junior
against
the
canal
company
no
principle
is
better
worth
a
great
lawyer
vindication
than
that
these
corporations
in
their
infancy
shall
not
trample
upon
the
private
rights
of
a
gentleman
and
treat
his
scholarship
and
services
like
the
labor
of
a
slave
well
said
and
highly
thought
interposed
judge
custis
said
clayton
continued
john
randel
still
reading
the
aid
of
his
abilities
to
a
stranger
and
a
gentleman
inhospitably
treated
in
the
state
of
delaware
no
no
cried
clayton
that
is
a
charge
against
me
i
will
not
permit
said
clayton
read
randel
inflexibly
the
possibilities
of
light
riches
and
honor
for
himself
and
justice
for
a
chooses
cowardice
mediocrity
and
darkness
he
extinguishes
my
hopes
and
his
with
this
randel
by
a
singular
fanning
of
his
hands
and
waft
of
his
breath
put
out
all
the
candles
at
once
and
left
the
whole
room
in
darkness
judge
custis
was
the
first
to
speak
after
this
extraordinary
illustration
clayton
i
believe
he
has
a
good
case
that
is
not
the
point
now
clayton
said
with
rising
spirit
and
emphasis
the
point
now
is
i
guilty
of
inhospitality
goy
that
touches
me
as
a
delawarean
and
is
a
high
offence
in
this
little
state
it
is
true
that
this
suitor
is
a
stranger
he
comes
to
me
with
an
introduction
from
my
brilliant
young
friend
seward
of
new
york
who
vouches
for
him
but
the
corporation
he
menaces
is
also
entitled
to
hospitality
it
is
in
the
main
philadelphia
capital
girard
himself
that
frugal
yet
useful
citizen
is
one
of
its
promoters
my
own
state
and
maryland
too
have
interests
in
this
work
is
it
the
part
of
hospitality
to
be
taking
advantage
of
our
small
interposing
geography
and
laying
by
the
heels
through
our
local
courts
a
young
struggling
and
indeed
national
undertaking
let
the
courts
of
your
state
which
are
pure
decide
between
us
said
john
randel
junior
relighting
the
candles
with
his
no
lawyer
ought
to
refuse
the
trial
of
such
a
public
cause
because
of
any
state
scruples
judge
custis
put
in
in
his
grandest
way
that
is
not
national
it
is
not
whig
brother
clayton
the
judge
here
gave
his
entire
family
power
to
his
facial
energy
and
expressed
the
virginian
and
patrician
in
his
treatment
of
the
delaware
and
plebeian
granted
that
this
corporation
is
young
and
untried
let
it
be
disciplined
in
time
that
it
may
avoid
more
expensive
mistakes
in
the
future
no
cause
to
a
true
lawyer
is
like
a
human
cause
the
time
may
come
when
the
talent
of
the
american
bar
will
be
the
parasite
of
corporations
and
monopolists
but
it
is
too
early
for
that
degradation
for
you
and
me
senator
clayton
the
rights
of
a
man
involve
all
progress
progress
indeed
is
for
man
not
man
for
progress
as
a
son
of
maryland
if
he
came
helpless
and
penniless
to
me
i
would
not
let
this
gentleman
be
sacrificed
if
i
were
a
rich
man
clayton
would
take
my
case
the
engineer
said
my
poverty
is
my
disqualification
in
his
eyes
he
again
essayed
in
a
dramatic
way
to
fan
out
the
candles
but
his
breath
failed
him
his
hands
became
limp
and
then
hastily
covered
his
eyes
and
he
sank
to
the
table
with
a
groan
and
put
his
head
upon
it
convulsively
gentlemen
he
uttered
in
a
voice
touching
by
its
distress
oh
gentlemen
professional
life
my
art
is
indeed
a
tragedy
the
easy
sensibilities
of
judge
custis
were
at
once
moved
senator
clayton
looking
from
one
to
the
other
in
nervous
indecision
seeing
custis
dewy
eyes
and
randel
proud
breaking
down
was
himself
carried
away
and
shouted
i
goy
this
is
a
conspiracy
but
randel
i
take
your
case
i
see
a
man
cry
goy
as
they
all
arose
sympathetically
and
shook
hands
a
knock
came
on
the
door
and
there
was
a
call
for
clayton
he
returned
in
a
few
minutes
with
a
rather
grim
countenance
and
said
randel
i
have
just
declined
a
big
round
to
defend
the
very
suit
your
tears
and
brother
custis
have
persuaded
me
to
prosecute
but
goy
a
tear
always
robbed
me
of
a
dollar
this
sympathy
will
make
you
an
independent
man
for
life
exclaimed
the
engineer
i
have
done
milburn
first
errand
right

custis
thought
five
minutes
delay
would
have
been
fatal

at
princess
anne
vesta
had
moved
her
husband
to
teackle
hall
and
he
occupied
her
father
room
and
seemed
to
be
growing
better
though
the
doctor
said
that
he
had
best
be
sent
to
the
hills
somewhere
the
free
woman
mary
whom
jimmy
phoebus
sent
to
vesta
had
arrived
very
opportunely
and
took
aunt
hominy
place
in
the
kitchen
where
all
the
children
echoes
were
gone
the
poor
woman
own
bereavement
thrilling
the
ears
of
virgie
roxy
and
vesta
herself
but
alas
her
tale
was
not
legal
testimony
because
she
was
a
little
black
jack
wonnell
had
found
unexpected
favor
in
meshach
milburn
eyes
and
was
appointed
to
sleep
in
the
store
and
watch
it
and
there
roxy
came
down
in
the
twilights
and
with
pity
more
than
affection
heard
him
weave
the
illusion
of
his
love
for
her
willing
to
be
amused
by
it
because
it
was
so
sincere
with
him
for
jack
was
all
lover
and
meek
and
artful
bold
and
domestic
soft
and
outlawed
as
the
houseless
thomas
cat
that
makes
highways
of
the
fences
and
wooes
the
demurest
kitten
forth
by
the
magic
of
his

to
git
you

fur

said
the
pitying

you
a

foolish
fellow
but
i
like
to
hear
you
talk
i
reckon
there
is
no
harm
in
you
virgie

in
love
too
with
a
white
man
but
you
must
breathe
it
never
said
jack
making
solemn
motions
with
his
eyes
and
cuddling
closer
in
dead
earnest
of
sympathy

i
may

roxy
pore
sister
virgie
she
was
made
to
love
and
though
it
hopeless
i
think
she
loves
tilghman
our
minister
because
he
loved
miss
vesty
once
and
virgie
worships
miss
vesty
like
her
sister
vesta
told
the
story
of
mary
the
free
woman
to
her
husband
who
listened
closely
and
said
i
know
of
but
one
thing
my
darling
that
will
make
such
ignorance
and
cruelty
fade
out
in
the
forests
of
this
peninsula
an
iron
road
a
new
thing
called
the
has
just
been
made
by
an
englishman
one
george
stephenson
and
a
specimen
of
it
has
been
sent
to

where
i
have
had
it
examined
the
errand
your
father
went
to
do
for
me
he
has
done
well
i
shall
send
him
to
annapolis
next
to
get
a
charter
for
a
railroad
up
this
peninsula
that
will
pass
inside
the
line
of
maryland
and
penetrate
every
kidnapping
settlement
hidden
there
and
light
intercourse
and
law
shall
exterminate
such
barracoons
as
johnson
vesta
was
glad
to
hear
her
father
praised
by
her
husband
and
hopes
rekindled
of
some
happier
family
reunion
when
she
should
feel
the
heartache
die
within
her
that
now
raged
intermittently
during
her
vestal
honeymoon
a
letter
came
on
the
fourth
day
which
dashed
these
hopes
to
the
ground
and
it
was
as
follows
dorchester
county
idol
of
my
heart
let
me
begin
by
entreating
you
to
take
a
conservative
course
when
i
break
the
sad
intelligence
to
you
of
the
death
of
my
dear
sister
lucy
at
cambridge
yesterday
of
the
heart
disease
she
was
the
star
of
the
house
of
mclane
she
is
gone
is
mine
saith
the
lord
and
i
shall
take
a
conservative
though
course
on
the
parties
who
have
inflicted
this
injury
upon
you
my
dear
niece
and
upon
your
calm
and
collected
if
stricken
uncle
lord
moves
in
a
way
his
wonders
to
perform
and
his
humble
instruments
require
only
to
be
and
to
do
all
things
well
be
assured
that
shall
be
done
upon
the
adversaries
of
our
family
and
right
speedily
my
own
grief
is
composed
in
the
satisfaction
i
shall
take
and
the
assurance
that
your
sainted
mother
is
where
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
the
financial
arrangements
of
my
dear
sister
were
of
the
most
conservative
and
character
as
was
to
have
been
expected
of
her
you
may
be
desirous
my
outraged
but
i
hope
still
idol
to
hear
the
particulars
of
lucy
death
she
did
not
reach
cambridge
till
near
midnight
having
made
the
long
journey
from
princess
anne
without
fitting
companions
and
in
the
excited
state
of
her
feelings
after
she
left
vienna
in
the
evening
a
depression
of
the
spirits
accompanied
by
a
fluttering
of
the
heart
came
on
and
rapidly
increased
and
by
the
time
she
arrived
at
our
relatives
she
was
nearly
dead
with
nervous
apprehension
and
weakness
on
seeing
me
she
revived
sufficiently
to
make
her
will
in
the
most
and
conservative
manner
a
physician
was
procured
but
he
pronounced
her
system
so
debilitated
and
detoned
as
hardly
probable
to
outride
the
shock
the
nervous
centres
being
depressed
and
atrophy
setting
in
she
talked
incessantly
about
the
and
said
it
was
a
permanent
shadow
and
weight
upon
your
heart
and
made
me
promise
to
it
if
it
could
conservatively
be
done
i
read
to
my
dear
sister
from
book
of
and
tried
to
compose
her
feelings
but
she
broke
out
ever
and
anon
brother
allan
to
think
i
have
raised
children
to
be
bought
and
sold
and
married
to
foresters
and
trash
she
was
deeply
sensitive
as
to
what
would
be
said
about
it
in
baltimore
just
before
she
died
she
said
not
bury
me
at
princess
anne
where
that
fiend
can
come
near
me
with
his
frightful
hat
take
me
to
baltimore
where
there
are
no
nor
old
family
chattels
to
disturb
the
respectability
of
death
apologize
for
my
daughter
do
her
and
so
this
grand
woman
died
in
the
confidence
of
a
blessed
immortality
leaving
us
to
vindicate
her
motives
and
continue
her
conservative
course
and
to
meet
at
her
funeral
next
friday
at
our
church
in
baltimore
where
rev
john
breckenridge
will
preach
the
funeral
sermon
over
this
murdered
saint
with
conservative
yet
proud
grief
affectionately
your
uncle
allan
mclane
oh

vesta
exclaimed
turning
blindly
towards
her
husband
mother

i
turn

but
to

poor
soul
milburn
replied
knowing
nothing

be
notified

am
able
to
attend
the
funeral

sobbed
well

ordered
by
the
doctor
to
go
and
get
above
the
line
of
malaria
in
the
hills

can
make
the
effort
now
her
grief
and
loneliness
deprived
her
of
the
will
to
refuse
him
roxy
was
selected
to
be
her
mistress

upon
the
journey
and
william
tilghman

to

down
to

for

jack
wonnell
in
officious
zeal
to
be
useful
gathered
flowers
and
hung
around
teackle
hall
to
run
errands
and
in
order
not
to
exasperate
vesta
husband
appeared
bareheaded
as
the
party
set
off
being
one
of
the
articles
of
travel
and
milburn
vouchsafing
these
words
to
jack
there
is
a
dollar
for
you

i
rely
upon

to

my
old

agin
he
waved
his
arms
with
real
tears
dimming
his
vision
and
roxy
affected
to
shed
some
tears
also
as
she
waved
to
virgie
whose
eyes
were
turned
with
wistful
pain
upon
the
beautiful
face
of
her
mistress
receding
down
the
vista
vesta
threw
her
a
kiss
and
reclined
her
head
upon
her
husband
shoulder
that
evening
an
hour
before
the
carriage
was
to
return
virgie
and
the
free
woman
mary
walked
together
down
to
milburn
store
to
see
if
jack
wonnell
was
on
the
watch
as
they
trode
in
the
soft
grass
and
sand
under
the
old
storehouse
they
saw
the
hat
a
new
one
brought
from
the
ancient
stock
that
very
day
shining
glossily
on
wonnell
high
eccentric
head
as
he
sat
in
the
hollow
window
of
the
old
storehouse
and
talked
to
the
which
he
was
feeding
with
a
full
of
boiled
potato
and
egg
and
some
blue
haws
tom
say

roxy
roxy
poor
ole
jack
poor
ole
jack
the
bird
flew
around
wonnell
head
biting
at
the
hat
which
stood
in
such
elegant
irrelevance
to
the
remainder
of
his
dress
and
cried
meshach
he
he
he
vesty
she
vesty
meshach
vesty
meshach
but
said
nothing
the
village
vagrant
would
teach
it
he
showed
the
patience
idleness
can
well
afford
and
feeding
it
a
little
or
withholding
the
food
awhile
continued
to
plead
and
teach
roxy
purty
roxy
poor
pore
jack

jack
the
bird
flew
and
struck
and
sang
a
little
very
niggardly
and
so
as
the
lights
in
the
west
sank
and
faded
the
shiftless
lover
continued
in
vain
to
seek
to
give
the
bird
one
note
more
than
the
magician
his
master
had
taught
the
stars
modestly
appeared
in
the
soft
heavens
and
princess
anne
gathered
its
roofs
together
like
a
camp
of
camels
in
the
desert
and
with
an
occasional
bleat
or
bark
or
human
sound
seemed
dozing
out
the
soft
fall
night
absorbed
perhaps
in
the
spreading
news
of
custis
death
and
vesta
that
had
to
be
taken
at
last
miss
virgie
said
the
woman
mary
ten
years
her
senior
but
comely
still
have
you
ever
loved
like
me
oh
i
had
a
kind
husband
and
helpless
as
i
was
i
tried
to
love
once
more
maybe
it
was
a
sin
i
love
my
mistress
as
if
she
was
myself
virgie
said
i
feel
as
if
in
heaven
before
we
came
here
i
was
with
her
mary
i
love
her
father
too
as
if
he
was
not
my
master
but
my
friend
oh
how
i
love
them
all
but
what
can
i
do
to
show
my
love
poor
naked
slave
that
i
am
they
say
they
will
soon
set
me
free
mary
how
do
people
feel
when
they
are
free
they
do
appreciate
it
sighed
mary
they
go
and
put
themselves
in
captivity
again
like
selfish
things
they
falls
in
love
but
to
love
and
be
free
virgie
said
her
bosom
glowing
in
the
thought
till
her
rich
eyes
seemed
to
shed
warmth
and
starlight
on
her
companion
face
to
give
your
own
free
love
to
some
one
and
feel
him
grateful
for
it
what
a
gift
and
what
a
joy
is
that
he
might
be
thankful
for
it
and
seeing
how
pure
it
was
he
might
respect
me
who
is
it
virgie
mary
said
whoever
would
love
me
like
a
white
girl
the
ardent
slave
softly
exclaimed
it
must
be
some
one
who
does
not
despise
me
i
hear
miss
vesta
beau
master
william
read
the
beautiful
service
with
his
sweet
submissive
face
and
i
think
to
myself
freely
he
might
have
my
heart
to
comfort
his
if
he
would
take
it
like
a
gentleman

backward

on

and
all
was

william
tilghman
was
driving
back
from
whitehaven
in
the
melancholy
thoughts
inspired
by
the
departure
of
his
cousin
whom
he
had
at
last
seen
go
into
the
great
wilderness
of
the
world
the
passive
companion
of
her
husband
like
the
wife
of
cain
driven
forth
with
him
when
the
carriage
was
arrested
at
the
ancient
presbyterian
church
which
overlooked
princess
anne
from
the
opposite
bank
of
the
little
river
by
a
woman
almost
throwing
herself
under
the
wheels
why
lord
sakes
it
our
virgie
cried
rhoda
holland
the
girl
with
all
the
energy
of
dread
sprang
into
the
carriage
by
william
tilghman
side
and
threw
her
arms
around
him
save
me
save
me
what
ails
you
virgie
cried
the
young
man
assuringly
you
are
in
no
danger
child
i
am
sold
the
girl
gasped
with
terror
on
her
tongue
and
in
her
wild
eyeballs
miss
vesty
sold
me
to
her
uncle
allan
he
sent
the
kidnappers
after
me
they
yonder
in
princess
anne
oh
drive
me
to
the
north
to
the
swamps
anywhere
but
there
i
know
your
mistress
made
you
over
to
her
mother
virgie
for
a
precaution
fearing
you
might
not
be
safe
in
her
own
hands
she
told
me
so
and
asked
if
the
death
of
her
mother
could
possibly
affect
you
oh
it
has
the
girl
whispered
mary
knows
the
kidnapper
that
come
for
me
he
is
the
same
that
stole
hominy
and
the
children
he
kept
her
chained
on
an
island
he
says
he
have
me
to
do
as
he
pleases
master
mclane
lets
him
have
me
the
girl
in
her
terror
as
the
carriage
had
descended
the
hill
already
and
crossed
the
manokin
seized
the
reins
in
tilghman
hands
and
drew
them
with
such
frenzy
that
the
horses
as
they
came
to
meshach
store
were
pulled
into
the
open
area
before
it
where
something
in
their
surprise
or
lying
on
the
ground
gave
them
immediate
fright
and
they
dashed
at
a
gallop
into
front
street
the
wheels
passing
over
an
object
by
the
old
storehouse
that
nearly
upset
the
carriage
the
street
they
took
for
their
run
crossed
a
small
arm
of
the
manokin
and
led
up
to
a
gentleman
gate
but
before
this
brook
was
crossed
tilghman
an
experienced
horseman
and
driver
had
reined
the
flying
animals
into
a
nearly
unoccupied
street
called
back
alley
parallel
with
the
main
street
of
princess
anne
but
hidden
from
it
by
houses
and
gardens
and
almost
in
a
moment
of
time
the
whole
town
had
been
cleared
with
hardly
a
person
in
it
aware
of
such
a
vehicle
going
past
it
was
a
real
runaway
but
tilghman
in
a
cool
gentle
voice
like
a
brook
music
told
the
girls
to
sit
perfectly
still
as
they
had
a
clear
level
road
and
seeing
that
he
could
not
stop
the
animals
by
any
mere
exercise
of
strength
without
danger
to
his
harness
he
waited
for
their
power
to
wear
out
or
their
fears
to
subside
rhoda
holland
was
ashamed
to
scream
if
her
pride
was
not
too
well
aroused
already
in
the
presence
of
the
muscular
young
minister
sitting
there
like
an
artillery
teamster
driving
into
battle
and
his
nostrils
and
jaws
delineated
in
the
gray
air
expressed
almost
the
joy
he
had
long
put
by
of
following
the
hounds
in
the
autumn
where
judge
custis
said
he
had
been
the
perfect
pattern
of
a
rider
as
for
virgie
she
felt
no
fear
of
wild
horses
since
they
were
leaving
behind
the
bloody
hunters
of
men
and
women
and
she
almost
wished
it
was
herself
alone
dashing
at
that
frightful
pace
to
destruction
until
the
young
man
mindful
perhaps
of
his
mistress
torn
from
his
sight
to
inhabit
another
arms
and
feeling
that
this
poor
quadroon
was
dear
as
a
sister
to
vesta
heart
bent
down
in
the
midst
of
his
apprehensions
and
kissed
the
slave
girl
pityingly
then
with
an
instant
greater
torrent
of
tears
a
sense
of
rest
and
man
respect
fell
upon
virgie
soul
and
she
paid
no
heed
to
time
or
dangers
till
the
carriage
came
to
a
stop
in
the
deep
forest
sands
several
miles
east
of
princess
anne
william
said
rhoda
holland
what
air
we
to
do
to
save
virgie
uncle
meshach
gone
jedge
custis
is
nobody
knows
whar
now
this
yer
allan
mclane
aunt
vesty

severe
i
think
it
a
conspliracy
to
steal
virgie
when
they
all
away
misc
somers
would
take
keer
of
her
but
i
afraid
she
tell
somebody
are
you
sure
that
you
saw
and
heard
truly
the
minister
said
to
virgie
oh
yes
i
saw
the
same
man
at
milburn
the
day
he
was
taken
sick
he
looked
at
me
a
low
familiar
look
and
muttered
something
evil
mary
knew
him
too
well
oh
do
not
take
me
back
to
princess
anne
i
will
never
go
there
again
it
may
be
true
tilghman
reflected
it
probably
true
vesta
has
no
faith
in
allan
mclane
she
says
he
makes
money
in
the
negro
trade
with
all
his
religious
formality
he
is
the
trustee
already
of
custis
estate
no
doubt
the
administrator
by
will
he
may
have
sent
joe
johnson
to
kidnap
virgie
under
color
of
his
right
and
johnson
would
abuse
anybody
vesta
will
never
forgive
us
if
we
let
virgie
go
to
him
but
i
am
a
slave
virgie
sobbed
oh
my
lord
to
think
i
am
not
miss
vesta
but
a
strange
man
slave
how
could
she
give
me
away
it
was
an
error
of
judgment
tilghman
replied
she
could
not
anticipate
her
mother
immediate
death
yet
there
where
she
thought
you
safest
you
were
most
in
peril
they
had
now
crossed
the
dividing
creek
into
worcester
county
and
halted
to
cool
the
horses
off
at
the
same
old
spring
under
the
where
meshach
milburn
stopped
the
evening
he
went
to
the
furnace
village
william
rhoda
holland
spoke
if
virgie
is
mclane
slave
you
keep
him
from
her
she
ca
go
back
to
prencess
anne
at
all
i
do
mean
that
she
shall
rhoda
i
know
you
are
a
brave
woman
and
we
will
drive
her
to
snow
hill
and
leave
her
there
with
a
nurse
a
free
woman
once
belonging
to
my
family
and
this
nurse
has
a
husband
who
is
said
to
be
a
conductor
on
what
is
called
the
underground
road
to
the
free
states
lord
sakes
a
abolitionist
i
hope
so
tilghman
said
i
know
vesta
wants
to
set
this
girl
free
and
there
is
no
way
to
do
it
and
respect
her
womanhood
but
by
giving
her
a
wild
beast
chance
to
run
my
my
and
you
a
minister
of
the
gospil
william
yes
of
the
gospel
that
tells
me
how
to
be
a
neighbor
to
my
neighbor
the
young
man
eyes
flashed
i
never
felt
so
humiliated
for
my
cloth
and
for
my
country
as
now
to
think
how
many
men
preach
the
gospel
of
god
all
their
lives
long
and
have
never
set
a
living
soul
free
i
will
do
one
such
christian
felony
by
the
help
of
christ
as
he
spoke
the
sound
of
a
fiddle
and
of
foresters
naked
feet
dancing
on
the
floor
of
the
old
milburn
cabin
came
crooning
out
in
the
night
in
another
hour
they
were
at
the
furnace
village
its
blast
gone
out
its
lines
of
huts
deserted
no
human
soul
to
be
seen
and
the
lying
like
a
parchment
under
the
funereal
seemed
stained
with
the
blood
of
the
that
oozed
upward
from
the
depths
like
the
corpse
of
murdered
enterprise
suffocated
in
meshach
foreclosure
a
sense
of
desolation
filled
them

was
it
in

consigned
to
the

and
the
horses
toiled
through
the

till
an
open
country
of
farms
gave
better
roads
and
at
ten
at
night
they
crossed
the
pocomoke
at
snow
hill
and
stopped
at
a
gate
before
a
neat
whitewashed
house
with
a
large
over
the
centre
and
two
doors
and
a
single
window
in
the
front
it
stood
in
a
short
street
leading
to
the
river
whose
and
reeds
were
seen
near
by
among
the
masts
of
vessels
and
the
mounds
of
sawdust
virgie
kissed
rhoda
and
descended
with
tilghman
who
opened
a
gate
and
going
up
some
steps
knocked
at
a
door
a
window
opened
and
there
was
a
parley
and
the
door
soon
afterwards
unclosed
softly
and
admitted
them
oh
may
god
let
you
know
some
night
the
pure
bed
and
sleep
you
have
brought
me
to
virgie

said

minister
said
we
will
buy
it
for
you
if
we
can
but
get
it
for
yourself
if
you
can
do
it
he
kissed
her
again
with
the
instinct
of
a
father
to
a
child
and
hastened
to
his
horses
and
the
hotel
as

and
rhoda
at
the

dawn
started
for

not
disposed
of
when

reached

the

many
turnpikes
as
the
chesapeake
had
rivers
at
morning
vesta
looked
upon
the
fleet
of
little
sail
lying
in
the
basin
of
the
city
among
larger
ships
and
arks
and
barges
and
saw
federal
hill
red
clay
rising
a
hundred
feet
above
the
piers
and
the
spotless
monument
to
washington
resting
its
base
as
high
above
the
tide
on
a
nearly
naked
bluff
the
rich
sunrise
fell
on
the
streaked
flag
of
the
republic
at
the
mast
on
fort
mchenry
and
the
garrison
band
was
playing
the
very
anthem
that
lawyer
key
had
written
in
the
elation
of
victory
though
a
prisoner
in
the
enemy
hands
alas
how
many
a
prisoner
in
the
enemy
hands
was
doing
tribute
to
that
flag
from
and
tobacco
land
and
pouring
the
poetry
of
his
loyalty
and
toil
to
the
very
emblem
of
his
degradation
vesta
heard
with
both
satisfaction
and
sorrow
at
barnum
hotel
that
her
husband
was
too
ill
to
attend
the
funeral
and
must
keep
his
room
and
fire
she
needed
his
comfort
and
devotion
in
her
sorrow
but
upon
her
dead
mother
bier
seemed
to
stand
the
injunction
against
that
fateful
hat
he
had
brought
with
him
and
yet
she
pitied
him
that
he
must
stay
alone
unknown
unrelated
chattering
with
the
chill
or
burning
without
complaint
god
send
you
sympathy
from
the
angels
like
you
my
darling
milburn
said
i
know
what
it
is
to
lose
a
mother
escorts
in
plenty
waited
on
vesta
but
she
wished
she
could
find
some
kinsman
of
her
husband
if
ever
so
poor
to
take
his
arm
to
the
church
and
and
at
the
news
that
her
uncle
allan
mclane
had
not
arrived
and
would
not
probably
now
be
present
she
felt
another
blending
of
relief
and
apprehension
because
her
husband
might
not
be
exasperated
by
him
yet
his
relations
to
her
mother
property
would
still
remain
unknown
and
vesta
feared
for
virgie
in
the
same
impulse
which
had
made
her
retain
teackle
hall
to
secure
it
against
her
father
careless
business
methods
she
had
made
virgie
over
to
her
mother
to
place
her
apparently
farther
from
danger
never
supposing
that
in
those
prudent
hands
the
enemy
might
insinuate
but
death
the
deathless
enemy
was
filching
everywhere
and
though
she
could
not
see
why
virgie
could
be
persecuted
vesta
now
wished
she
had
set
her
free
the
girl
belonged
to
her
mother
estate
suppose
allan
mclane
was
the
administrator
of
it
suppose
indeed
he
was
the
heir
vesta
heart
fell
as
she
considered
that
a
woman
had
best
let
business
alone
the
young
was
an
object
of
mingled
admiration
and
sympathy
as
she
leaned
on
the
arm
of
a
kinsman
and
entered
the
presbyterian
kirk
she
was
considered
one
of
the
great
beauties
of
maryland
and
the
young
robert
breckenridge
fresh
from
kentucky
on
a
visit
to
his
brother
the
pastor
thought
he
had
never
seen
vesta
equal
even
in
kentucky
and
as
he
gazed
through
her
mourning
veil
the
pastor
delaware
wife
heard
him
whisper
divinity
itself
the
clear
olive
skin
eyes
of
gray
twilight
eyebrows
like
own
arches
and
luxuriant
hair
were
touched
by
grief
as
if
a
goddess
suffered
and
in
her
deep
mourning
robes
vesta
seemed
a
daughter
about
to
pass
through
some
convent
to
her
sainthood
she
had
the
height
to
give
dignity
to
this
beauty
and
the
grace
to
lift
pathos
above
weakness
the
minister
musical
tones
were
wrought
to
consonance
with
this
noble
human
model
and
he
spoke
of
that
ideal
motherhood
which
to
every
child
at
the
bier
seems
real
as
the
dripping
bucket
at
the
fairy
well
of
mother
love
trials
weakness
and
immortality
of
the
absence
of
her
sympathy
making
the
first
great
bereavement
in
life
progress
of
her
nature
abiding
in
us
and
her
spirit
hovering
over
while
we
live
painted
in
the
soft
hues
of
personal
experience
prescribed
to
her
needs
with
a
physician
art
doing
all
that
funeral
talk
can
do
to
raise
the
final
tears
from
among
the
heartstrings
and
pour
them
in
oblation
upon
the
corpse
the
pastor
consolation
had
the
effect
of
some
mesmeric
hand
that
weakens
our
systems
while
it
sublimates
our
feelings
and
vesta
female
nature
was
almost
broken
down
where
could
she
lean
for
the
close
sympathy
befitting
such
grief
her
father
was
not
here
and
she
had
none
but
her
husband
the
husband
of
less
than
a
week
but
still
the
nearest
to
her
need
on
him
she
allowed
herself
to
rest
that
solemn
evening
after
her
mother
body
had
sought
the
ground
he
was
well
again
for
the
time
for
the
first
time
she
was
alone
with
him
and
as
the
shadows
narrowed
their
chamber
and
they
sat
with
no
other
light
than
a
little
wood
smouldering
in
the
grate
he
came
to
her
and
began
to
talk
of
childhood
and
his
own
mother
of
the
little
sorrows
his
mother
had
shared
with
him
of
domestic
disagreements
and
happy
anew
how
men
feel
when
the
partner
of
life
is
taken
away
and
children
know
not
the
meaning
of
death
that
has
done
so
awful
a
thing
upon
the
inoffensive
one
but
above
all
is
shining
meshach
said
the
star
of
motherhood
faintly
lighting
our
way
mellowing
our
souls
and
basking
on
the
waters
as
he
continued
and
she
could
not
see
him
but
only
hear
the
plaintiveness
of
his
voice
it
became
comfortable
to
hear
him
speak
and
she
grew
more
passive
a
sense
of
resignation
fell
upon
her
heart
and
of
gratitude
to
him
that
could
divine
her
loss
so
touchingly
and
like
a
child
she
rested
upon
his
side
upon
his
knee
and
in
his
arms
at
last
not
fond
nor
yet
infatuated
but
subsiding
and
consenting
accepting
her
destiny
like
a
myriad
of
women
that
are
neither
oppressed
nor
tender
but
with
reluctance
yield
she
passed
out
of
grief
to
wifedom
like
one
tired
and
in
a
dream
visits
of
consolation
were
made
by
a
few
old
friends
for
a
day
or
two
succeeding
the
rev
henry
lyon
davis
late
president
of

at

brought
robert
smith

the

of

at
washington
these
and
others
looking
at
meshach
milburn
a
little
oddly
found
him
on
acquaintance
a
man
of
sense
but
the
mclanes
who
called
were
either
supercilious
or
studiously
avoided
the
groom
an
invitation
came
from
arlington
house
to
vesta
to
bring
milburn
there
and
as
they
proceeded
out
the
washington
road
in
a
private
carriage
they
observed
ross
winans
car
with
nearly
forty
people
in
it
making
its
trial
trip
behind
a
horse
at
a
gallop
at
the
relay
house
where
the
horses
on
the
railroad
were
changed
milburn
remarked
gazing
up
the
patapsco
valley
my
wife
we
are
here
at
the
birth
of
this
little
iron
highway
if
our
vision
was
great
enough
we
might
see
the
mighty
things
that
may
happen
upon
it
servile
insurrection
sectional
war
great
armies
riding
to
great
battles
thousands
of
emigrants
drawn
to
the
west
we
shall
die
but
generations
after
us
this
road
will
grow
and
continue
like
a
vein
of
iron
whose
length
and
uses
no
man
can
measure
the
road
to
washington
was
in
places
good
and
often
turned
in
among
the
pines
at
riverdale
they
saw
the
deer
of
george
calvert
a
descendant
of
one
of
the
lords
baltimore
browsing
in
his
park
and
his
great
carriage
was
going
in
the
from
a
state
visit
to
the
custises
passing
direct
to
georgetown
from
bladensburg
they
encountered
general
jackson
taking
his
evening
ride
on
horseback
and
saw
the
chasm
of
the
new
canal
being
dug
along
the
potomac
and
then
crossing
mason
ferry
they
were
set
down
at
arlington
house
an
hour
after
dark
the
hospitable
harmless
proprietor
welcomed
them
into
the
huge
edifice
half
temple
half
barn
among
his
elaborate
daubs
of
pictures
and
furniture
and
relics
of
custis
and
washingtonian
times
he
was
nearly
fifty
years
of
age
of
indian
features
but
rather
weak
face
like
one
whose
only
substantiality
was
in
his
ancestors
and
vesta
placing
him
beside
her
husband
reflected
that
a
similar
inbreeding
had
produced
a
similarity
in
the
two
men
both
of
a
sallow
and
bilious
attenuation
but
milburn
beside
her
kinsman
custis
was
like
a
bold
wolf
beside
a
sheep
yet
these
men
liked
each
other
immediately
milburn
intelligence
and
money
and
real
reverence
for
the
great
man
who
had
adopted
custis
giving
him
admittance
to
the
latter
fancy
they
strolled
through
those
beautiful
woods
one
day
to
become
a
grove
of
sepulture
for
an
army
of
dead
while
vesta
in
the
dwelling
talked
with
her
cousins
and
with
the
graceful
lieutenant
lee
who
was
courting
mary
custis
it
was
a
happy
domestic
life
and
in
the
host
veins
ran
the
blood
of
the
calverts
though
not
of
the
legitimate
line
it
was
suggested
to
go
to
the
capitol
and
milburn
growing
daily
better
in
the
hill
region
went
also
and
wore
his
steeple
hat
greatly
to
the
edification
of
custis
who
revelled
in
such
antiquities
vesta
heard
the
ladies
whispering
when
they
returned
that
a
parcel
of
boys
and
negroes
had
followed
the
hat
laughing
and
jeering
and
had
finally
driven
the
party
to
their
carriage
this
and
her
impatience
to
return
to
his
business
hastened
their
departure
from
arlington
they
took
the
steamer
down
the
potomac
and
as
they
came
off
the
mouth
of
mary
river
milburn
donned
his
raleigh
hat
again
and
stood
on
deck
looking
at
the
lights
about
the
old
priest
house
where
the
capital
of
lord
baltimore
lay
a
naked
plain
and
a
few
starveling
mementoes
within
the
bight
of
a
sandy
point
that
faced
the
archipelago
of
the
eastern
shore
my
hat
said
milburn
to
himself
is
old
as
yonder
town
and
better
preserved

calverts
and
milburns

the
ordeal
when
levin
dennis
awoke
in
the
bottom
of
the
old
wagon
it
was
being
rapidly
driven
and
van
dorn
voice
from
the
driver
seat
was
heard
to
say
without
its
usual
lisp
and
spanish
interjection

said
van
dorn
and
passed
by
with
a
crack
of
his
whip
levin
whom
some
friendly
hand
had
wrapped
in
a
bearskin
coat
he
had
seen
one
like
it
upon
van
dorn
next
heard
the
slaver
speak
to
another
party
he
had
overtaken

ah

the
stars
were
out
yet
the
night
was
rich
in
large
fleecy
clouds
as
if
heaven
were
hurrying
onward
too
levin
lay
on
his
back
jostled
by
the
rough
wagon
but
being
perfectly
sober
now
he
was
more
reasoning
and
courageous
and
his
love
impelled
him
to
he
might
have
rolled
out
of
the
vehicle
and
into
the
woods
and
at
least
saved
himself
from
committing
further
crime
but
how
would
he
see
hulda
any
more
hulda
in
danger
perhaps
thus
even
to
ignorance
love
brings
understanding
and
levin
began
to
ask
himself
the
cause
of
his
own
misery
he
knew
it
was
liquor
yet
what
made
him
drink
if
not
a
disposition
too
easily
led
even
now
he
was
under
almost
voluntary
subjection
to
the
bandit
in
the
wagon
whose
voice
he
heard
blandly
command
again
to
some
pair
he
had
caught
up
to
tindel
tackle
van

you
are
not
to
be

so
keep

exclaimed
an
insinuating
voice
from
a
negro
rider
are
to
meet
us
all
at
devil
jim
tackle
captin
politely
captain
as
van
dorn
urged
his
way
to
the
head
of
the
line
levin
looked
out
silently
upon
the
flat
country
of
forest
and
a
few
poor
farms
drained
imperfectly
by
some
ditches
of
the
choptank
he
supposed
it
might
be
almost
midnight
from
the
position
of
those
brilliant
constellations
which
shone
down
equally
upon
his
mother
and
himself
she
in
her
innocence
and
he
in
his
anxiety
and
shone
also
perhaps
upon
his
poor
father
grave
in
isle
or
ocean
within
an
hour
blood
was
to
be
shed
no
doubt
and
rapine
done
and
he
knew
not
the
road
to
escape
by
nor
the
hole
to
hide
in
yet
in
that
hour
he
had
to
make
his
choice
to
fight
for
liberty
or
go
to
the
jail
the
or
perhaps
the
gallows
levin
considered
ruefully
his
vagrant
past
and
how
little
could
be
said
in
extenuation
of
him
in
a
court
of
justice
except
by
his
faith
which
was
no
more
evidence
than
a
negro
oath
once
it
arose
in
his
mind
to
surprise
van
dorn
overcome
him
cast
him
out
in
a
ditch
and
drive
to
some
one
of
the
little
farmhouses
and
rest
till
day
should
give
him
his
whereabouts
and
remedy
levin
was
not
a
coward
and
his
muscles
were
hard
and
his
feet
could
cling
to
a
smooth
plank
like
a
bird
to
a
bough
but
his
heart
relented
to
the
fierce
soft
man
so
unsuspectingly
sitting
with
his
back
to
him
when
levin
reflected
that
he
must
perhaps
put
an
end
to
van
life
with
his
sailor
knife
if
they
grappled
at
all
and
this
day
expiring
van
dorn
had
paid
a
debt
for
him
to
the
widow
whose
son
was
next
overtaken
and
who
cried
forwardly
without
being
addressed
van
dorn
what
you
goin
to
give
me
if
i
git
a
nigger
this
said
van
dorn
without
a
pause
reaching
the
boy
a
measured
blow
with
his
on
the
shoulder
that
made
him
literally
fall
from
the
mule
and
grovel
with
pain
discipline
is
what
your
mother
failed
to
give
you
manners
i
shall
teach
you
fall
in
the
rear
owen
daw
crawled
desperately
on
his
mule
and
obeyed
without
parley
but
his
audacity
soon
recovered
enough
to
force
his
animal
up
to
the
wagon
tail
and
open
whispered
communications
with
levin
there
nothing
had
passed
them
for
hours
that
levin
had
seen
when
suddenly
a
horseman
at
a
rapid
lope
stopped
the
wagon
and
a
hoarse
negro
voice
muttered
how

levin
obligingly

youths

they
halted
at
a
small
brick
house
of
one
story
and
a
kitchen
and
garret
at
the
left
of
the
road
to
which
the
corner
of
a
piece
of
oak
and
hickory
woods
came
up
shelteringly
while
in
the
rear
several
small
barns
and
cribs
enclosed
the
triangle
of
a
field
a
door
in
the
middle
towards
maryland
seemed
very
and
low
grated
windows
were
at
the
cellar
on
each
side
of
the
steps
the
place
had
a
suspicious
appearance
and
a
pack
of
hounds
in
full
cry
rushed
from
the
kitchen
and
while
in
the
act
of
leaping
the
stile
and
palings
were
arrested
almost
in
mid
air
by
a
chuffy
voice
crying
from
within
hya
down
spitch
the
whole
pack
meekly
sneaked
back
to
the
house
whining
low
and
a
few
blows
of
a
switch
and
short
howls
within
completed
the
excitement
what
place
is
this
asked
owen
daw
devil
jim
clark
said
sorden
the
dwelling
stood
about
forty
yards
back
from
the
road
drawing
nearly
into
the
cover
of
the
woods
and
its
little
yard
was
made
cavernous
by
and
maple
trees
while
a
line
of
and
an
old
rose
along
the
road
and
hedge
as
they
rode
to
the
rear
of
the
house
a
little
dormer
window
like
a
snail
crawled
low
along
the
roof
and
a
light
was
shining
from
it
devil
jim
nodded
sorden
what
his
business
asked

freshly

from
the
house

is
particular
your
men
must
go
to
the
barn
come
in
spiced
brandy
at
the
barn
a
quiet
remark
from
somewhere
was
sufficient
to
lead
the
herd
away
and
giving
the
order
to
water
and
fodder
van
dorn
passed
into
the
kitchen
thence
through
a
bedroom
to
the
chief
room
of
the
house
and
up
a
small
to
a
scrap
of
hallway
or
corridor
hardly
two
feet
wide
the
man
who
led
pointed
to
a
trap
above
one
end
of
this
hall
and
exclaimed
niggers
there

the
last
reference
to
a
door
closing
the
little
passage
he
then
opened
a
wicket
at
the
side
of
the
hall
admitting
van
dorn
to
an
exceedingly
small
closet
or
garret
room
barely
large
enough
for
the
men
to
sit
and
lighted
by
a
lamp
in
the
little
dormer
window
seen
from
below
drink
said
the
man
uncorking
a
bottle
of
champagne
i
had
it
ready
for
you
he
poured
the
foaming
wine
and
set
the
bottle
on
a
sort
of
secretary
or
desk
and
then
looked
anxiety
and
avarice
together
out
of
his
liquid
black
eyes
and
broad
heavy
face
suérte

shook
hands
and
drank
another
glass
and
then
van
dorn
said

the
lad
who
will
reply
to
the
name
of
levin
with
him
i
would
speak
while
you
give
the
directions
poor
coward
van
dorn
said
after
his
host
had
descended
the
stairs
he
can
never
be
less
than
a
thief
with
that
irksomeness
under
such
fair
competence
at
that
moment
a
beautiful
maid
or
woman
in
her
white
stood
in
the
little
doorway
with
eyes
so
like
the
richness
of
his
just
gone
that
it
must
have
been
his
daughter
she
fled
as
she
recognized
a
stranger
and
van
dorn
pursued
till
a
door
was
closed
in
his
face
poor
fool
he
said
sinking
into
his
chair
again
i
will
never
be
more
honest
than
any
woman
can
make
me
as
levin
entered
the
little
hallway
van
dorn
smiled
here
is
a
glass
of
real
wine
to
inspire
you
no
captain
i
would
rather
die
than
drink
it
do
you
repent
coming
with
me
oh
bitterly
captain
i
do
want
to
steal
poor
helpless
people
if
they
is
black
now
listen
lad
van
dorn
face
ceased
to
blush
and
the
coarse
look
came
into
his
blue
eyes
this
night
excursion
is
for
your
profit
i
like
your
gentle
inclination
for
me
and
the
good
acts
you
have
solicited
from
me
and
the
confidence
you
have
shown
me
as
to
your
love

me
in
this
work
willingly
and
i
will
give

your
marriage
settlement

share

levin
exclaimed
van
dorn
drew
his
knife
and
rose
to
his
feet
levin
he
lisped
i
promised
patty
cannon
that
i
would
bring
you
back
spotted
with
crime
or
dead
now
choose
which
it
shall
be
to
die
then
cried
levin
with
one
hand
drawing
the
long
silken
hair
from
his
eyes
and
with
the
other
drawing
his
own
knife
but
i
will
fight
for
my
life
van
dorn
seized
levin
wrist
in
a
grip
but
as
he
did
so
threw
his
own
knife
upon
the
floor
oh
waif
van
dorn
murmured
while
his
blush
returned
take
heed
thou
ever
sayest
with
courage
like
that
when
cowardice
or
weak
acquiescence
would
extort
thy
this
moment
if
thou
hadst
consented
thy
heart
would
be
on
my
knife
young
levin
he
drew
the
knife
from
levin
hand
and
put
it
in
his
ragged
coat
again
and
set
the
boy
on
his
knee
as
if
he
had
been
a
little
child
oh
god
be
thanked
i
did
not
kill
you
sir
sobbed
levin
his
tears
quickly
following
his
courage
twice
i
have
thought
of
doin
it
i
never
would
have
put
you
to
that
test
my
poor
lad
but
that
i
saw
your
conscience
at
work
all
this
day
under
the
stimulation
of
virtuous
love
think
nothing
of
me
build
your
own
character
upon
some
good
example
and
sweet
as
life
is
fight
for
it
on
the
very
frontiers
of
your
character
young
but
surrender
only
when
you
are
old
captain
levin
said
how
kin
i
git
character
my
father
is
dead
everybody
twists
me
around
his
fingers
then
think
of
some
plain
strong
faithful
man
you
may
know
and
refer
every
act
of
your
character
to
him
ask
yourself
what
he
would
do
in
your
predicament
then
go
and
do
the
same
i
do
know
such
a
man
levin
said
in
another
moment
it
is
jimmy
phoebus
my
poor
beautiful
mother
beau
rayo
ha
caido
van
dorn
spoke
low
and
calm
yes
levin
any
man
worthy
of
your
mother
will
do
captain
turn
back
with
me
is
it
too
late
too
late
these
many
years
young
i
shall
lead
the
war
on
africa
again
at
cowgill
house
he
rose
and
finished
the
wine
clark
shall
give
you
a
horse
levin
i
present
it
to
you
ride
on
with
sorden
at
the
lead
and
a
mile
from
here
at
camden
town
take
your
own
way
taking
a
single
look
at
the
miserable
band
of
whites
and
blacks
collected
in
the
barn
and
revealed
by
a
lantern
light
in
the
excitement
of
drink
and
avarice
or
the
familiarity
of
fear
and
vice
some
inspecting
gags
of
and
bucks
of
hickory
others
trimming
clubs
of
blackjack
with
the
roots
attached
others
loading
their
and
greasing
the
thereon
some
whetting
their
knives
upon
harness
others
cutting
rope
and
cord
into
the
lengths
to
bind
men
feet
levin
was
set
on
the
loping
horse
he
had
been
already
riding
by
clark
the
host
and
soon
met
sorden
on
the
road
where
is
van
dorn
sorden
asked
i
love
him
as
i
never
loved
a
male
he
sends
me
to
camden
of
an
errand
levin
answered
is
it
far
about
a
mile
three
miles
then
to
dover
my
skin
how
fresh
your
critter
is
ai
it
dirck
molleston
i
thought
so
then
he
be
wantin
to
turn
in
at
cooper
corners
does
derrick
live
there
yes
that
whar
he
holds
the
forks
of
both
roads
from
below
and
watches
the
law
in
dover
i
hope
van
dorn
will
git
away
with
the
loot
and
not
git
ketched
fur
i
love
him
as
i
never
loved
a
male
levin
horse
at
his
easy
gait
soon
left
sorden
far
behind
and
the
strange
events
of
the
night
and
his
wonder
what
to
do
next
kept
levin
brain
whirling
till
he
saw
the
form
of
a
few
houses
rise
among
the
trees
and
a
line
of
arborage
indicate
a
main
road
from
north
to
south
the
scent
as
of
cold
wide
waters
and
marshes
filled
the
night
here
is
camden
levin
thought
where
shall
i
go
if
i
turn
south
i
shall
get
no
bed
nor
food
all
night
and
be
picked
up
in
the
mornin
fur
a
kidnapper
i
ca
go
back
the
big
river
or
the
ocean
i
reckon
is
before
me
what
would
jimmy
phoebus
do
he
held
the
animal
in
as
he
asked
this
question
and
paused
at
the
crossing
of
the
great
state
road
the
idea
slowly
spread
upon
his
whole
existence
that
james
phoebus
would
in
levin
place
ride
instantly
to
dover
and
give
the
alarm
levin
tried
to
construct
phoebus
in
a
mood
to
give
some
other
advice
but
as
the
resolute
pungy
captain
form
seemed
to
bestride
the
young
man
mind
it
rose
more
and
more
stalwart
and
appeared
to
lead
towards
dover
where
so
many
poor
souls
in
the
joys
of
intercourse
and
freedom
were
like
little
birds
unconscious
of
the
hawks
above
them
and
no
man
in
the
world
but
levin
dennis
could
save
them
from
death
or
bondage
would
james
phoebus
with
his
lion
nature
ever
hesitate
in
the
duty
of
a
citizen
and
a
christian
under
such
circumstances
or
forgive
another
man
for
withholding
information
that
might
be
life
and
liberty
and
mercy
yet
there
was
van
dorn
to
be
betrayed
what
would
van
dorn
do
in
place
the
words
of
van
dorn
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
old
spoke
aloud
in
levin
echoing
consciousness
think
nothing
of
me
refer
every
act
to
some
faithful
man
and
go
and
do
the
same
levin
looked
up
and
the
very
clouds
now
swollen
dark
in
spite
of
starshine
seemed
hurrying
on
dover
the
were
crying
mercy
mercy
the
lizards
and
seemed
to
cross
each
other
voices
piping
time
time
time
levin
whispered
and
let
the
reins
fall
loose
and
his
animal
darted
through
camden
town
to
the
north
he
had
gone
by
the
small
frame
houses
the
quaker
meeting
the
stores
the
outskirt
residences
when
suddenly
his
horse
turned
out
to
pass
a
large
dark
object
in
the
road
ahead
and
a
horseman
rode
right
across
levin
course
forcing
his
animal
back
on
its
haunches
high
doings
friend
a
man
voice
raspingly
spoke
i
concerned
for
thee
git
out
of
my
way
or
i
stab
you
levin
cried
between
his
new
ardor
to
do
his
duty
and
the
idea
that
he
had
already
been
intercepted
by
patty
cannon
band
ha
friend
i
less
concerned
for
myself
than
thee
thou
wilt
not
stab
a
citizen
of
camden
town
at
his
own
door
for
heaven
sake
let
me
go
then
levin
pleaded
the
kidnappers
is
coming
to
dover
in
a
few
minutes
i
want
to
tell
lawyer
clayton
immediately
the
other
person
a
tall
lean
man
wheeled
and
dashed
after
the
dark
object
ahead
which
levin
following
also
hard
found
to
be
a
large
covered
wagon
something
between
the
dearborn
or
farmer
and
the
family
carriage
bill
the
quaker
called
to
the
driver

whip
till

past
here

one
who
says
kidnappers
are
raiding
even
the
capital
of
delaware
i
concerned
for
thee
the
driver
began
to
whip
his
horses
into
a
gallop
and
cries
as
of
several
persons
came
out
of
the
vehicle
what
in
there
levin
asked
the
quaker
who
had
rejoined
him
niggers
no
friend
the
quaker
crisply
answered
only
christians
they
crossed
a
and
soon
afterwards
a
smaller
run
without
speaking
and
came
to
a
little
cabin
in
a
fork
of
the
road
where
levin
horse
tried
to
run
in
ha
friend

levin
forcing

up
the
road

than
a
youth
in
this
dwelling

pass
the
quaker

pointing
to
a
brick
house
on
the
left
for
there

cowgill
house
long
after
midnight
dover
was
in
bed
except
at
one
large
house
on
the
capitol
green
where
light
shone
through
the
chinks
and
cracks
of
curtains
and
shutters
and
some
perhaps
ran
along
curiously
to
see
why
the
stars
and
clouds
in
the
somewhat
troubled
sky
looked
down
through
the
leafless
trees
upon
the
pretty
town
and
jones
creek
circling
past
it
and
hardly
noticed
a
long
band
of
creeping
men
and
animals
steal
up
from
the
meeting
house
branch
past
the
tannery
and
the
academy
and
plunge
into
the
back
streets
of
the
place
avoiding
the
public
square
one
file
turned
down
to
the
creek
and
crossed
it
to
return
farther
above
cutting
off
all
escape
by
the
northern
road
while
a
second
file
slipped
silently
through
and
around
the
compact
little
hamlet
and
waited
for
the
other
to
arrive
when
both
encompassed
an
old
brick
dwelling
standing
back
from
the
roadside
in
a
green
and
venerable
yard
nearly
half
a
mile
from
the
settled
parts
of
dover
this
house
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
the
and
shade
trees
were
all
defined
as
they
stood
above
the
swells
of
green
verdure
and
the
ornamental
paths
and
one
majestic
extended
its
long
branches
nearly
to
the
portal
of
the
quaint
dwelling
and
a
luxuriant
growth
of
ivy
starting
between
the
cellar
windows
clambered
to
the
corniced
carpentry
of
the
eaves
and
made
almost
solid
panels
of
vine
of
the
spaces
between
the
four
large
keystoned
windows
in
two
stories
which
stood
to
the
right
of
the
broad
dumpy
door
this
door
at
the
top
of
a
flight
of
steps
was
placed
so
near
the
gable
angle
of
the
house
that
it
gave
the
impression
of
but
one
wing
of
a
mansion
originally
designed
to
be
twice
its
length
and
size
between
this
gable
which
faced
the
road
and
had
four
lines
of
windows
in
it
besides
a
basement
row
and
the
back
or
town
door
as
described
was
one
squarish
roomy
window
out
of
relation
to
all
the
rest
and
perhaps
twelve
feet
above
the
ground
this
as
might
be
guessed
was
on
the
landing
of
the
stairs
within
for
the
great
door
and
front
of
the
residence
being
at
the
opposite
side
the
whole
of
the
space
at
the
townward
gable
to
the
width
of
seventeen
feet
was
a
noble
hall
about
forty
feet
long
lofty
and
with
pilasters
in
architectural
style
and
lighted
by
two
great
windows
in
the
gable
and
the
square
window
on
the
stairway
the
stairway
itself
was
a
beautiful
piece
of
work
and
proportion
rising
from
the
floor
in
ten
railed
steps
to
the
landing
at
the
square
window
where
a
space
several
feet
square
commanded
both
the
great
front
door
and
the
windows
in
the
gable
and
also
the
yard
behind
thence
at
right
angles
the
flight
of
steps
rose
along
the
back
wall
to
a
second
landing
over
the
dumpy
and
by
a
third
leap
returned
at
right
angles
to
the
floor
above
making
what
is
called
the
well
of
the
stairway
to
be
exceedingly
spacious
and
it
opened
to
the
garret
floor
no
doubt
this
cool
great
hall
was
designed
to
be
the
centre
of
a
large
mansion
yet
it
had
lost
nothing
in
agreeableness
by
becoming
instead
the
largest
room
in
the
house
receiving
abundant
daylight
and
it
was
large
enough
for
either
a
feast
or
public
worship
and
such
was
its
frequent
use
built
by
a
tyrannical
eccentric
man
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
it
had
passed
through
several
families
until
a
quaker
named
cowgill
who
afterwards
became
a
methodist
and
who
held
no
slaves
and
was
kind
to
black
people
made
it
his
property
and
superintended
a
tannery
and
mill
within
sight
of
it
he
was
frequently
absent
for
weeks
especially
in
the
bilious
autumn
season
and
allowed
his
domestics
to
assemble
their
friends
and
the
general
race
at
odd
times
in
the
great
hallway
for
such
rational
enjoyments
as
they
might
select
in
truth
the
owner
of
the
house
desired
it
to
get
a
more
cheerful
reputation
for
the
negroes
in
particular
considered
it
haunted
the
first
owner
it
was
said
had
amused
himself
in
the
great
by
making
his
own
children
stand
on
their
toes
switching
their
feet
with
a
whip
when
they
dropped
upon
their
soles
from
pain
or
fatigue
and
his
own
son
finally
shot
at
him
through
the
great
northern
door
with
a
rifle
or
pistol
leaving
the
mark
to
this
day
to
be
seen
by
a
small
panel
set
in
the
original
pine
the
third
owner
a
lawyer
often
entertained
travelling
clergymen
here
and
on
one
occasion
the
eccentric
reverend
lorenzo
dow
met
on
the
stairs
a
stranger
and
bowed
to
him
and
afterwards
frightened
the
host
family
by
telling
it
since
they
were
not
aware
of
any
stranger
in
the
house
the
room
over
the
great
door
had
always
been
considered
the
haunt
of
peculiar
people
who
molested
nobody
living
but
appeared
there
in
some
quiet
avocation
and
vanished
when
pressed
upon
this
main
door
itself
had
a
character
and
was
battened
or
built
in
half
so
that
the
upper
part
could
be
thrown
open
like
a
window
and
yet
the
lock
on
this
upper
part
was
a
foot
and
a
half
long
and
the
key
weighed
a
pound
this
ponderous
door
in
elaborate
carpentry
opened
upon
a
flight
of
steps
and
on
a
surrounded
by
elms
firs
and
paulownia
trees
the
latter
of
a
beany

and

a
lower
servants

of
the

the
knocker
on
the
great

sounded
and
it
sprang
open
and
quickly
slammed
again
and
a
stifled
strange
sound
followed
as
of
a
scuffle
van
dorn
agile
as
a
panther
sprang
on
milman
back
and
looked
into
a
window
in
the
gable
drawing
his
face
away
so
as
to
be
unseen
in
the
night
the
bright
interior
was
full
of
people
sitting
back
against
the
wainscoting
as
if
listening
to
a
sermon
while
down
the
middle
of
the
stately
hall
stretched
a
table
lighted
by
lamps
and
many
little
candles
and
filled
with
the
remnants
of
a
feast
the
stairway
in
the
corner
van
dorn
could
not
see
and
there
the
dusky
audience
was
all
facing
as
if
towards
the
preacher
there
seemed
a
something
out
of
the
common
in
the
kind
of
attention
the
inmates
were
paying
but
van
eyes
were
absorbed
in
the
sight
of
several
drooping
and
yet
almost
startled
quadroon
maids
and
he
only
noticed
that
the
spy
ransom
could
not
be
seen
sorden
van

said

then
said
van

softly
if

lifted
break
them
in
he
twisted
by
main
strength
a
panel
out
of
the
palings
near
the
house
and
led
the
way
to
the
great
front
door
a
dozen
desperate
hands
seized
the
heavy
panel
and
ran
with
it
the
door
flew
open
but
at
that
moment
every
light
in
cowgill
house
went
out
dar
ghosts
in
dar
the
hoarse
voice
of
derrick
molleston
was
heard
to
say
and
the
negro
element
stopped
and
shrank
tindel
your

van

exclaimed
and
after
a
delay
the
old
house
and
shady
yard
meantime
illumined
by
lightning
and
sounds
of
thunder
rolling
in
the
sky
a
blazing
all
prepared
was
procured
and
van
dorn
holding
it
in
his
left
hand
and
with
nothing
but
his
rude
whip
in
his
right
bounded
in
the
door
shouting
patty
cannon
has
come
at
that
dreaded
name
there
were
a
few
suppressed
shrieks
and
the
great
windows
at
the
gable
side
fell
inwards
with
a
crash
as
the
kidnappers
came
pouring
over
van
dorn
quick
eye
took
in
the
situation
as
he
waved
his
torch
and
it
lighted
ceiling
and
pilaster
the
doors
on
the
left
and
the
great
beyond
filled
with
black
forms
in
the
attitude
of
defence
patty
cannon
has
come
he
shouted
again
follow
me
an
instant
only
brought
him
to
the
base
of
the
staircase
and
the
lightning
flashing
in
the
gaping
windows
and
fallen
door
revealed
him
to
his
followers
with
his
yellow
hair
waving
and
his
long
silken
mustache
like
golden
flame
a
mighty
yell
rose
from
the
emboldened
gang
as
they
formed
behind
him
with
bludgeons
and
iron
knuckles
billies
and
slings
and
whatever
would
disable
but
fail
to
kill
van
dorn
far
ahead
made
three
murderous
slashes
of
his
whip
across
the
human
objects
above
and
with
a
toss
of
that
formidable
weapon
clubbed
it
and
darted
on
at
the
moment
loud
explosions
and
smoke
and
cries
filled
the
echoing
place
as
a
volley
of
firearms
burst
from
the
landing
sweeping
the
line
of
the
windows
and
raking
the
hall
the
band
on
the
floor
below
stopped
and
some
were
down
groaning
and
cursing
they
armed
it
treachery
a
voice
in
panic
cried
and
the
cowardly
assailants
ran
to
places
of
refuge
some
crawling
out
at
the
portal
some
dropping
from
the
windows
and
others
getting
behind
the
stairway
out
of
fire
and
seeking
desperately
to
draw
the
bolts
of
the
smaller
door
there
patty
cannon
has
come
van
dorn
repeated
throwing
himself
into
the
body
of
the
defenders
who
terrified
at
his
bravery
began
to
retreat
upward
around
the
angles
of
the
stairs
one
man
however
did
not
retreat
neither
did
he
strike
but
wrapped
van
dorn
around
the
body
in
a
pair
of
long
and
powerful
arms
and
lifted
him
from
the
landing
by
main
strength
saying
high
doings
friend
i
concerned
for
thee
van
dorn
felt
at
the
grip
that
he
was
overcome
he
tried
to
reach
for
his
knife
but
his
arms
were
enclosed
in
the
unknown
stranger
who
having
seized
him
from
behind
sought
to
push
him
through
the
square
window
on
the
landing
into
the
grass
yard
below
where
the
rain
was
falling
and
the
lightning
making
brilliant
play
among
the
herbs
and
ferns
as
the
kidnapper
prepared
himself
to
fall
with
all
his
joints
and
muscles
relaxed
the
boy
owen

lying
bloodthirstily
along
the
limb
of

his

huddled
together
till

bore
him
off
muttering

the
desperate
party
beneath

broke
open
the

there
and
rushed
forth
only
to

of

thrown
by

cried

they
screamed
with
anguish
and
rolled
in
the
wet

with
fears

than

road
in
blindness
and
some
way
to

saw
a

of

john

standing
before
his
office
as
the
rising
sun
innocently
struck
the
in
the
public
square
of
dover
judge
custis
sitting
at
an
upper
window
observed
that
many
noble
elms
and
locusts
had
been
riven
by
lightning
or
torn
by
wind
and
floods
of
rain
what
a
night
custis
exclaimed
the
jail
burned
the
lightning
appalling
and
i
thought
i
heard
firearms
too
judge
custis
heard
clayton
say
as
he
entered
the
room
so
ole
derrick
molleston
aunt
braner
asked
you
about
my
dinner
did
he
and
it
bill

that
burned

and
the
black
people
licked
the

ejaculated
aunt
braner
fervently
clayton
turned
to
a
young
man
at
the
table
now
dressed
in
a
good
clean
suit
of
clothes
and
said
as
the
old
cook
left
the
room
now
friend
dennis
tell
your
tale
goy
the
boy
whom
the
judge
was
startled
to
recognize
at
once
began
jedge
custis
the
kidnapper
man
you
left
in
the
kitchen
has
stole
aunt
hominy
and
your
little
niggers
they
was
at
johnson
last
night
maybe
they
gone
before
this
my
boat
was
hired
to
take
off
and
i
had
to
come
along
but
i
run
away
from
the
band
and
give
last
night
to
clayton
yer
before
the
judge
could
reply
clayton
exclaimed
now
brother
custis
permit
me
now
let
my
noble
old
constituent
and
jonathan
hunn
resume
friend
spoke
out
a
wiry
lean
man
this
young
man
surprised
me
last
night
with
intelligence
that
thy
maryland
friends
were
marching
on
the
very
capital
of
delaware
to
steal
men
i
was
out
in
the
road
at
that
late
hour
for
another
christian
purpose
and
the
lord
rewarded
me
with
this
good
one
i
brought
friend
dennis
to
john
clayton
back
door
and
he
lent
us
all
his
firearms
at
the
little
brick
grocery
of
william
parke
just
beyond
the
cowgill
house
where
i
am
told
he
sells
ardent
liquors
to
negroes
contrary
to
law
and
so
takes
the
name
among
them
of
parke
i
found
several
of
our
free
delaware
negroes
i
fear
on
no
good
errand
so
i
remarked
william
parke
contrary
to
law
has
been
selling
thee
brandy
out
of
an
eggshell
as
if
he
knew
not
the
contents
i
shall
pay
him
to
repeat
the
vile
enticement
quickly
for
ye
who
are
of
the
world
must
fight
this
night
goy
said
clayton
warming
up
quakers
will
set
other
people
on
wo
they
goy
other
gunpowder
arms
were
there
procured
and
we
barricaded
cowgill
house
so
as
to
make
it
at
once
a
decoy
and
a
hornet
nest
i
despise
war
and
men
of
war
so
much
that
i
have
somewhat
studied
their
campaigns
and
i
suggested
friend
clayton
that
the
stairway
was
a
good
tactical
defensive
position
is
that
the
vain
term
to
send
a
volley
out
the
main
door
and
a
flank
fire
on
every
door
and
window
on
the
sides
of
cowgill
hall
it
also
commanded
the
back
yard
by
a
window
on
the
staircase
a
door
beneath
the
staircase
was
barricaded
there
was
a
festival
or
feast
given
that
night
by
absent
friend
permission
by
these
dover
folks
of
color
i
would
not
wonder
if
it
was
designed
or
discovered
by
these
scoundrels
on
thy
line
of
states
friend
custis
i
told
the
to
leave
their
huzzies
all
below
in
the
till
the
attack
began
and
then
to
let
them
escape
up
the
stairway
and
to
defend
that
stair
like
sinful
men
but
first
a
negro
spy
knocked
on
the
door
and
a
loop
was
thrown
over
his
neck
and
two
of
the
black
boys
gagged
him
then
the
attack
was
made
and
at
my
order
all
the
lights
were
put
out
oh
jedge
levin
dennis
broke
in
it
was
short
and
dreadful
captain
van
dorn
had
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
when
the
niggers
up
fired
over
his
head
and
shot
mos
everything
down
the
quaker
man
yer
then
pinioned
the
captain
an
dropped
him
wounded
out
of
the
high
window
i
pity
van
dorn
but
says
that
he
in
a
bad
business
i
hope
he
ai
dead
who
is
this
van
dorn
asked
judge
custis
i
heard
of
such
a
but
he
has
never
pestered
princess
anne
i
ran
and
hid
in
the
deep
eaves
of
the
garret
story
levin
continued
which
is
built
in
like
closets
and
the
wasps
there
coming
in
to
suck
the
blossoms
on
the
vines
that
has
growed
up
through
the
eaves
from
outside
flew
around
in
the
dark
among
the
yaller
gals
that
was
and
and
never
feelin
the
wasps
sting
em
thinkin
about
them
kidnappers
i
reckon
the
kidnappers
will
never
come
to
dover
no
more
two
things
surprise
me
clayton
said
that
joe
johnson
would
venture
to
raid
dover
itself
after
the
licking
i
got
him
and
that
free
darkeys
could
make
such
a
defence
ah
john
clayton
spoke
jonathan
hunn
there
was
a
white
witness
there
to
affirm
that
they
only
defended
their
lives
it
was
captain
van
dorn
that
raided
dover
levin
spoke
joe
johnson
is
a
coward
judge
custis
said
clayton
you
and
i
can
save
this
peninsula
at
least
from
the
sectional
excitements
that
are
coming
you
must
surrender
to
delaware
old
patty
cannon
and
her
household
she
now
lives
on
your
side
of
the
line
come
over
to
the
governor
office
with
me
and
i
will
get
a
requisition
for
her
on
the
business
of
last
night
young
dennis
here
knows
the
band
friend
hunn
saw
the
attack
judge
custis
face
grew
suddenly
troubled
clayton
he
said
i
would
rather
not
appear
in
this
matter
indeed
you
must
excuse
me
what
said
clayton
hesitate
to
do
a
little
thing
like
this
after
the
free
opinions
you
have
expressed
there
was
a
long
awkward
pause
the
quaker
arose
and
looking
well
at
judge
custis
said
none
but
almighty
god
knows
the
secrets
of
a
mind
no
son
of
adam
is
fit
to
be
absolute
over
any
human
creature
amen
judge
custis
said
meekly
the
news
from
princess
anne
confirmed
the
loss
of
vesta
custis
slaves
judge
custis
was
told
to
come
home
and
take
steps
for
their
recovery
but
he
was
strangely
apathetic
the
day
after
the
raid
levin
dennis
disappeared
clayton
only
saying
who
would
have
thought
that
boy
was
already
fascinated
by
these
kidnappers
he
has
taken
his
horse
and
gone
back
to
patty
cannon
the
suit
against
the
canal
company
required
a
great
deal
of
research
as
were
then
scarce
and
precedents
for
breaches
of
contract
against
corporations
were
not
many
this
form
of
legal
life
being
comparatively
modern
in
that
day
like
the
dawn
of
the
floral
age
or
before
megatheriums
grazed
above
the
trees
or
iguanodons
swam
in
the
canals
clayton
and
custis
walked
and
ate
and
lay
down
together
comparing
knowledge
and
suggestions
and
the
litigious
mind
of
john
randel
junior
was
rather
irritating
to
both
of
them
so
that
to
be
rid
of
his
society
in
dover
the
two
lawyers
meantime
supplied
with
money
by
meshach
milburn
draft
resolved
to
visit
the
canal
which
was
distant
about
thirty
miles
the
three
men
started
together
in
a
carriage
after
breakfast
on
a
soft
yet
frosty
morning
such
as
often
gives
to
this
region
a
winter
sparkle
and
mildness
like
the
florida
climate
they
passed
several
tidal
creeks
as
the
duck
and
the
little
duck
the
blackbird
and
the
apoquinimink
and
as
they
advanced
the
barns
became
larger
the
hedges
more
tasteful
and
trimmed
like
those
in
the
french
netherlands
the
leafless
peach
orchards
stretched
out
like
the
in
china
two
or
three
little
towns
studded
the
roadside
the
woods
gave
way
altogether
to
smaller
farms
and
at
a
steep
bottom
called
the
fiddler
bridge
they
turned
across
the
fields
to
an
old
galleried
mansion
at
the
end
of
a
long
lane
and
near
a
great
stagnant
pond
where
john
randel
junior
as
he
fully
named
himself
on
every
occasion
had
a
fine
dinner
spread
after
dinner
they
launched
upon
the
stream
in
a
row
and
sail
boat
to
clayton
trepidation
and
bore
out
through
acres
of
and
muskrats
and
terrapins
unnumbered
and
many
to
the
chesapeake
and
delaware
canal
which
extended
for
several
miles
through
a
mighty
pond
or
feeder
like
a
ditch
within
a
bayou
the
negro
rower
tied
their
boat
behind
a
passing
vessel
which
towed
them
out
to
the
locks
at
the
delaware
river
at
a
point
opposite
a
willowy
island
and
where
an
embryo
city
had
been
started
in
the
marshes
and
there
they
waited
for
the
packet
from
philadelphia
randel
took
his
negro
man
a
person
of
sorrowful
yet
inexpressive
countenance
to
be
a
kind
of
piano
or
model
on
which
to
play
his
fierce
gestures
clayton
said
he
sitting
on
a
stone
lock
in
the
evening
gloaming
i
ought
to
have
been
a
lawyer
not
that
i
am
not
the
greatest
theoretical
engineer
in
the
country
but
my
legal
genius
interposes
and
i
sue
the
villains
who
employ
me
here
he
gave
the
melancholy
negro
a
violent
shaking
who
took
it
as
stolidly
as
a
bottle
of
medicine
shaken
by
the
doctor
yes
you
sued
judge
ben
wright
and
he
nonsuited
you
i
tell
you
a
new
axiom
clayton
the
earnest
engineer
cried
putting
the
negro
down
on
his
hams
and
sitting
on
him
whoever
employs
genius
has
to
be
a
scoundrel
in
the
nature
of
their
relations
it
is
so
he
deflects
genius
from
its
full
expression
absorbs
the
virtue
from
it
and
is
a
fraud
here
he
kicked
the
negro
underneath
him
who
hardly
protested
well
then
spoke
judge
custis
as
clayton
is
a
man
of
genius
and
you
employ
him
i
a
scoundrel
of
course
randel
exclaimed
his
sense
of
law
and
right
must
yield
to
my
ideas
now
look
at
this
canal
had
i
not
been
obliged
to
defer
to
the
soulless
corporation
which
employed
me
i
would
have
dug
it
to
the
depth
that
the
tides
of
the
two
bays
would
have
filled
it
instead
of
damming
up
the
creeks
for
feeders
and
pumping
water
into
it
by
then
the
of
the
country
could
go
through
and
the
channel
would
be
purged
by
every
tide
he
stood
up
and
put
his
foot
on
the
negro
to
the
amusement
of
the
boys
gathering
around
john
fitch
the
engineer
said
john
clayton
left
a
curious
will
it
begins
william
rowan
my
trusty
friend
i
bequeath
my
beaver
hat
judge
custis
countenance
fell
thinking
of
another
hat
which
had
entered
his
family
the
barge
on
which
they
embarked
had
numerous
passengers
and
soon
came
to
a
small
and
and
a
few
miles
beyond
entered
upon
a
serious
piece
of
work
leaving
the
trough
of
a
creek
of
which
the
canal
had
previously
availed
itself
and
cutting
through
the
low
ridge
of
the
peninsula
which
to
judge
custis
seemed
almost
mountainous
he
was
of
that
patriotic
opulence
just
short
of
imagination
which
rejoiced
in
public
works
and
this
little
canal
only
fourteen
miles
long
was
with
two
or
three
exceptions
the
only
achieved
work
in
the
union
turnpikes
and
bridges
omitted
built
by
the
national
government
by
three
of
the
states
it
connected
and
by
private
subscription
it
had
involved
two
and
a
quarter
million
dollars
of
expense
no
light
burden
when
the
population
was
by
the
previous
census
less
than
eight
million
whites
in
all
the
land
judge
custis
family
troubles
faded
from
his
mind
as
he
looked
up
at
the
deep
cutting
nearly
seventy
feet
in
height
of
banks
with
sands
of
yellow
and
green
and
stains
of
iron
and
strata
of
marl
some
of
which
had
fallen
back
into
the
excavation
and
threatened
the
navigation
again
and
when
he
saw
a
bridge
called
the
buck
leap
the
chasm
ninety
feet
overhead
by
a
span
that
then
seemed
sublimity
itself
he
touched
clayton
and
said
never
mind
my
failures
thank
god
i
a
whig
goy
there
nothing
like
it
said
clayton
not
far
from
this
point
the
canal
passed
an
old
church
and
graveyard
at
a
bridge
where
clayton
said
his
namesake
the
revolutionary
governor
of
delaware
was
buried
here
randel
plain
conveyance
took
them
in
and
in
the
moonlight
they
drove
a
few
miles
to
randel
estate
near
the
banks
of
a
river
under
a
long
of
barren
clay
and
iron
stain
on
the
farther
shore
here
said
randel
is
my
future
estate
of
randalia
here
i
shall
see
all
the
commerce
of
the
canal
passing
by
and
garnishee
every
vessel
that
pays
my
tolls
to
the
canal
company
randel
asked
clayton
what
were
those
stakes
i
saw
some
distance
back
running
north
and
south
across
the
fields
a
railroad
survey
who
is
making
it
they
say
meshach
milburn
of
princess
anne
goy
exclaimed
clayton
i
beat
him
for
two
or
three
days
the
three
men
still
studying
the
canal
suit
drove
over
a
picturesque
country
visiting
the
old
manor
of
the
labadists
and
their
bohemian
patron
augustine
herman
the
homestead
of
the
late
treaty
minister
bayard
and
the
ancient
welsh
baptist
churches
among
the
hills
of
the
elk
and
christiana
where
some
of
warriors
lay
it
was
the
favorite
land
of
whitefield
and
in
the
neighborhood
was
an
iron
furnace
judge
custis
examined
with
melancholy
interest
as
one
of
the
investments
of
general
washington
father
more
than
a
hundred
years
before
when
the
indians
made
the

they
also
went
to

point
where
the
british
army
was
disembarked
to

i
can
say
nothing
the
night
i
drove
virgie
to
snow
hill
i
drove
over
poor
wonnell
body
a
strange
negro
was
seen
here
an
enemy
of
your
servant
samson
the
new
cook
at
teackle
hall
thinks
he
fired
the
shot
the
young
rector
felt
the
searching
look
of
those
resinous
eyes
staring
him
through
that
shot
was
meant
for
me
william
tilghman
perhaps
so
it
was
the
shot
of
a
hired
murderer
who
mistook
wonnell
unusual
hats
for
mine
that
was
not
well
described
to
him
or
the
description
of
which
his
drunken
and
excited
memory
did
not
retain
milburn
please
save
vesta
this
suspicion
oh
that
pure
soul
could
not
know
it
milburn
continued
with
a
moment
gentleness
but
some
of
her
proud
kin
to
whom
i
am
less
than
a
dog
did
send
the
assassin
i
think
i
guess
the
man
do
not
rush
to
a
conclusion
remember
vesta
has
suffered
so
much
for
others
errors
he
was
killed
in
this
room
where
wonnell
never
came
before
the
wound
shows
the
shot
to
have
come
from
a
point
below
where
nothing
but
wonnell
hat
and
not
his
features
could
be
seen
the
mistake
of
for
shows
that
it
was
a
stranger
job
the
poor
fool
died
for
me
now
where
did
the
bungler
who
killed
me
by
proxy
come
from
i
will
be
frank
with
you
sir
joe
johnson
the
kidnapper
was
also
here
mary
says
so
to
save
virgie
from
him
i
helped
her
away
now
said
milburn
what
enemy
of
mine
delegated
the
kidnapper
to
procure
a
murderer
he
waited
a
moment
without
response
and
answered
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
his
own
question
the
man
is
at
johnson
cross
roads
letters
from
cambridge
tell
me
so
it
was
the
deceased
custis
brother
allan
mclane
again
i
ask
you
to
think
of
vesta
and
her
many
sacrifices
i
do
i
have
promised
her
that
she
shall
never
receive
a
cruel
word
from
me
but
i
shall
not
spare
my
assassins
to
them
i
shall
be
as
one
they
have
killed
and
whose
blood
smokes
for
vengeance
i
possess
the
only
warrant
that
can
drive
them
from
maryland
he
laid
a
roll
of
on
the
table
suggestively
no
wealth
is
accumulated
in
vain
said
meshach
milburn
his
delicate
nostrils
distended
and
his
fine
hand
pointing
to
the
now
on
johnson
cross
roads
he
crossed
the
old
room
over
the
store
and
opening
the
green
chest
brought
out
the
entailed
hat
and
took
it
in
his
hand
with
a
grim
smile
here
is
something
i
thought
to
lay
aside
on
my
wife
account
he
spoke
her
people
compel
me
to
wear
it
i
thought
all
malice
to
this
poor
hat
would
be
done
with
my
social
triumph
here
but
i
am
not
a
man
to
be
frightened
let
them
kill
me
but
it
shall
be
under
my
ancestral
brim
oh
hear
your
sing
again
as
it
did
meshach
love
where
is
the
bird
meshach
milburn
shook
his
head
and
put
the
entailed
hat
upon
it
tom
left
me
he
said
when
they
began
to
fire
bullets
at
my
hat
vesta
female
instinct
had
already
found
the
explanation
of
death
from
the
moment
of
knowing
her
husband
his
fatal
hat
had
been
the
shadow
across
her
life
path
his
person
had
never
been
offensive
to
her
and
something
attractive
or
modifying
in
him
had
led
her
when
a
child
to
offer
a
flower
to
his
hat
to
give
it
consonance
with
himself
that
seemed
to
deserve
less
evil
a
fancied
insult
to
his
hat
had
made
him
quarrel
with
her
father
a
quarrel
which
involved
her
conquest
not
by
wooing
but
by
the
treaty
of
war
the
same
hat
had
inspired
the
superstition
which
led
her
kitchen
servants
to
leave
their
comfortable
home
and
had
been
the
insuperable
obstacle
to
her
mother
consent
to
her
marriage
it
had
caused
the
only
bitter
words
that
ever
passed
between
her
and
her
father
at
last
it
had
spilled
blood
and
her
uncle
she
well
knew
from
his
implacable
nature
had
set
the
ruffians
on
and
she
knew
as
well
that
her
husband
had
found
him
out
his
intelligence
which
would
have
been
otherwise
a
matter
of
pride
to
her
became
a
subject
of
fear
involved
with
his
hat
then
the
loss
of
virgie
was
hardly
less
severe
to
vesta
than
her
own
mother
it
was
true
that
roxy
pretty
and
loving
now
poured
all
her
devotion
at
her
mistress
feet
but
there
had
been
something
in
virgie
that
roxy
could
never
rise
to
a
dignity
and
hardly
less
than
a
white
woman
vesta
shed
bitter
tears
at
the
news
of
that
dear
comforter
flight
and
on
her
knees
praying
for
the
delicate
young
wanderer
she
felt
god
conviction
of
the
sins
of
slavery
alas
thousands
felt
the
same
who
would
not
admit
the
conviction
and
gave
excuses
that
welded
into
one
nation
at
last
the
sensitive
millions
who
could
not
agree
to
a
lesser
sacrifice
but
were
willing
to
give
war
a
little
note
from
snow
hill
told
vesta
that
her
maid
had
already
departed
and
would
only
write
again
from
free
soil
so
the
upbraided
hat
was
worn
more
often
than
before
and
vesta
had
to
suffer
much
humiliation
for
it
her
husband
now
moved
actively
to
organize
his
railroad
and
visited
the
maryland
towns
of
the
peninsula
taking
her
along
and
wearing
on
the
journey
his
king
james
tile
now
swathed
in
mourning
crape
at
cambridge
which
basked
upon
the
waters
like
an
english
venice
he
applied
the
sinews
of
war
to
a
listless
public
sentiment
and
the
county
press
began
to
call
for
joe
johnson
expulsion
and
patty
rendition
to
the
state
of
delaware
at
easton
lying
between
the
waters
on
her
treasures
of
marl
like
a
pearl
oyster
the
people
turned
out
to
see
the
little
man
in
the
peaked
hat
with
the
beautiful
lady
at
his
side
and
vesta
was
more
pained
for
her
husband
than
herself
to
feel
that
his
dress
was
prejudicing
his
railroad
as
business
no
less
than
beauty
revolts
from
any
outward
affectation
at
the
old
aristocratic
homes
on
the
wye
river
more
scowls
than
smiles
were
bestowed
on
the
eccentric
and
at
chestertown
where
originated
the
peales
who
drew
this
hat
into
their
museum
the
boys
burned
on
the
market
space
and
marched
in
hats
of
brown
wrappers
like
meshach
before
the
dwelling
of
host
the
greater
the
opposition
the
more
indomitable
milburn
grew
to
live
it
down
he
wrote
to
her
father
to
go
to
annapolis
and
work
for
a
railroad
charter
and
state
aid
and
began
grading
for
his
line
in
the
vicinity
of
his
old
store
at
princess
anne
throwing
the
first
shovelful
of
earth
himself
with
the
immemorial
hat
upon
his
sconce
this
time
there
were
no
shouts
and
he
almost
regretted
it
seeming
to
feel
that
jeers
carry
no
deep
malice
while
silence
is
hate
loyal
to
her
least
of
vows
and
wishing
to
love
and
obey
him
in
spirit
fully
vesta
felt
that
his
own
was
being
darkened
again
by
his
obstinacy
upon
this
single
point
of
an
obsolete
hat
he
looked
in
their
evening
circle
at
teackle
hall
like
a
younger
and
knightlier
person
in
a
modern
suit
of
clothes
and
slippers
of
gift
his
delicate
hand
well
became
the
ring
she
put
upon
it
and
when
he
talked
high
enthusiasm
and
sense
and
stood
ready
to
back
them
with
courage
and
money
vesta
thought
her
husband
lacked
but
one
thing
to
make
him
the
equal
of
his
supposititious
kinsman
the
democratic
martyr
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
that
was
another
she
almost
feared
to
broach
the
subject
knowing
that
an
old
sore
is
ever
the
most
sensitive
and
being
too
direct
and
frank
to
insinuate
or
practise
any
arts
upon
him
she
was
embroidering
an
of
velvet
for
him
one
day
when
tilghman
sent
a
and
in
it
was
a
fine
new
hat
of
the
current
style
he
answered
her
letter
politely
and
put
the
new
hat
upon
the
rack
of
teackle
hall
and
never
touched
it
again
next
rhoda
holland
his
niece
procuring
from
some
country
beau
a
and
beavers
were
growing
scarce
and
dear
in
that
peninsula
had
him
an
elegant
cap
made
of
it
for
the
cold
weather
now
coming
but
he
only
kissed
her
and
put
it
on
the
rack
and
there
it
tempted
the
moth
his
chills
and
fever
continued
at
broken
times
but
more
regular
became
the
dislike
and
opposition
of
the
old
class
of
society
as
he
undertook
to
become
the
promoter
of
his
region
they
regarded
it
as
audacity
worse
than
crime
he
had
outstripped
them
in
wealth
and
now
was
undermining
their
importance
many
avowed
that
they
would
never
ride
on
a
railroad
built
by
such
a
man
others
hoped
it
would
break
him
some
took
open
ground
against
his
work
and
wrote
letters
to
annapolis
to
prejudice
him
with
the
legislature
where
the
baltimore
interest
was
already
crying
loudly
that
an
eastern
shore
railroad
meant
to
take
maryland
trade
and
money
to
philadelphia
meshach
fiercely
responded
that
unless
the
railway
took
the
line
of
the
maryland
counties
delaware
state
would
build
it
and
carry
it
off
to
newcastle
instead
of
to
elkton
where
meshach
meant
to
unite
with
a
projected
baltimore
system
prudently
estimating
the
sparseness
of
his
fortune
to
execute
a
hundred
miles
of
embankment
and
railroad
milburn
yet
kept
up
a
display
of
surveyors
and
graders
in
several
counties
and
his
local
patriotism
had
at
least
the
appreciation
of
vesta
little
circle
in
the
meantime
the
continued
absence
of
samson
surprised
him
and
judge
custis
letters
were
irregular
and
long
coming
as
he
went
farther
north
while
two
letters
received
by
the
widow
dennis
were
as
mystical
as
they
were
assuring
one
in
a
female
hand
told
her
that
her
son
levin
was
being
tenderly
watched
and
another
in
man
writing
enclosed
some
money
and
said
her
son
would
soon
be
home
dennis
was
far
from
happy
in
this
indefinite
state
of
mind
and
her
heart
told
her
also
that
the
absence
of
james
phoebus
was
a
different
strain
she
loved
that
absentee
already
too
well
to
forgive
his
silence
one
day
before
november
vesta
said
to
her
husband
the
air
and
sky
are
warm
and
sparkling
yet
and
the
roses
are
out
you
work
too
hard
between
your
canal
case
and
your
railroad
let
us
fill
the
two
carriages
and
drive
to
old
rehoboth
and
eat
our
dinner
there
he
consented
and
they
took
with
them
grandmother
tilghman
and
william
rhoda
holland
roxy
and
dennis
and
also
the
poor
free
woman
mary
whom
jimmy
phoebus
had
released
from
her
chains
the
road
passed
in
sight
of
the
birthplace
of
the
lion
of
independence
in
maryland
samuel
chase
who
forced
that
hesitating
state
by
threatenings
and
even
riots
to
declare
for
permanent
separation
from
england
as
henry
winter
davis
by
the
same
means
years
afterwards
forced
her
rebels
against
the
union
to
show
their
hands
near
chase
birthplace
on
the
glebe
rose
the
old
washington
academy
out
in
a
field
raised
in
that
early
republican
day
when
a
generous
fever
for
education
following
the
act
of
tolerance
made
some
noble
that
the
growth
of
towns
ultimately
discouraged
with
four
great
chimneys
above
its
conical
roof
and
pediments
and
cupola
and
two
wide
stories
and
high
basement
all
made
in
staid
dark
brick
the
academy
yet
had
a
mournful
and
neglected
look
as
if
like
man
it
was
ruminating
upon
the
more
brutalized
times
and
lessening
enlightenment
false
systems
ever
require
ah
said
vesta
husband
how
many
a
poor
boy
thou
hast
sent
from
yonder
mutilated
for
life
honey
like
the
lovers
of
the
queen
bee
how
is
that
vesta
inquired
you
never
heard
of
the
queen
bee
women
when
they
die
may
turn
to
bees
and
reverse
their
hard
conditions
in
this
life
the
queen
bee
has
no
rival
in
the
hive
all
other
females
there
are
immature
and
all
the
males
are
dying
for
the
queen
she
has
five
hundred
lovers
so
lovesick
for
her
that
they
never
work
and
forty
times
as
many
maids
like
penelope
all
embroidering
comb
and
wax
how
was
that
proved
by
putting
the
bees
in
a
glass
house
and
watching
them
to
god
all
mankind
may
be
in
a
glass
hive
too
and
every
buzzer
secret
biography
be
kept
and
the
queen
bee
honeymoon
from
her
that
word
is
taken
she
flies
high
into
the
air
and
meets
a
lover
by
chance
she
has
so
many
that
one
is
sure
to
be
met
she
kisses
him
in
that
crystal
eddy
of
sunshine
and
in
the
transport
he
is
wounded
to
the
heart
how
many
young
drones
from
the
academy
have
seen
thee
once
and
swooned
for
life
but
the
queen
bee
also
has
a
fate
some
time
sir
yes
she
leaves
the
ancient
hive
at
last
and
settles
on
an
unsightly
somewhere
and
all
that
love
her
follow
the
herb
becomes
busy
with
music
and
sweetness
and
the
flashing
of
silver
wings
till
into
some
cone
the
farmer
gathers
the
swarm
and
it
is
their
home
vesta
looked
up
at
the
poetical
illustration
and
saw
her
conical
hat
into
which
she
had
been
hived
and
her
eyes
fell
to
her
mourning
weeds
oh
my
father
she
thought
has
he
kept
his
good
resolutions
it
is
all
i
have
left
to
hope
for
they
travelled
down
the
aisles
of
the
level
forest
sometimes
the
in
their
green
leafage
and
red
fruit
sometimes
the
cleanly
green
enriching
the
brown
concavity
of
oaks
and
at
the
scattered
settlement
of
kingston
the
jackson
candidate
for
governor
carroll
bowed
from
his
door
crossing
morumsco
creek
they
bore
to
the
east
and
soon
saw
on
a
plain
the
still
animate
ecclesiastical
hamlet
of
rehoboth
extending
its
two
ancient
churches
across
the
vision
the
road
ran
to
the
bank
of
the
river
pocomoke
where
a
ferry
was
still
maintained
to
the
opposite
shore
and
the
virginia
land
of
accomac
and
the
cold
tide
without
a
sail
went
winding
to
an
oystery
estuary
of
the
bay
where
the
mud
at
the
bottom
was
so
soft
that
vessels
aground
in
it
could
still
continue
sailing
as
on
the
muggy
globe
that
noah
came
to
shore
in
close
by
were
high
as
a
natural
bluff
made
by
the
indian
gourmands
before
john
smith
voyage
of
navigation
vesta
was
set
out
at
the
great
ruined
episcopal
church
that
like
a
castle
of
brick
made
the
gateway
of
rehoboth
while
william
tilghman
and
rhoda
strolled
into
the
open
door
of
the
brick
presbyterian
church
farther
on
and
milburn
put
up
the
horses
at
the
tavern
william
rhoda
asked
was
this
the
first
presbyterian
church
ever
made
yer
the
first
in
america
rhoda
this
was
rev
francis
makemie
church
he
lived
in
virginia
not
far
from
here
where
no
other
worship
was
permitted
but
ours
so
he
came
over
the
pocomoke
and
reared
a
church
of
logs
at
this
point
and
this
is
the
third
or
fourth
upon
the
spot
rehoboth
then
came
to
be
such
a
point
for
worship
that
the
established
church
put
up
yonder
noble
old
edifice
as
if
to
overawe
this
calvinistic
one
in
it
a
quare
old
house
said
rhoda
the
little
doors
that
opens
from
the
vestiblulete
into
the
side
galleries
sent
a
draught
right
down
the
preacher
back
at
the
fur
end
and
when
he
give
out
the
hymn
ye
the
trumpet
blow
he
always
blowed
his
nose
twice
so
they
boarded
up
the
galleries
and
let
the
ceiling
down
flat
and
if
we
go
up
thar
we
can
see
the
other
old
round
ceiling
william
so
they
went
up
the
narrow
stairs
from
the
door
and
came
into
the
tubes
of
galleries
all
closed
from
the
congregation
and
there
sitting
down
in
the
obscurity
the
preacher
passed
his
arm
around
rhoda
waist
take
keer
she
said
maybe
you
was
predestined
to
be
lost
yer
skeered
to
be
up
yer
half
in
the
dark
even
with
a
good
man
nevertheless
she
came
a
little
closer
to
him
and
looked
into
his
eyes
with
her
arch
demure
ones
the
young
rector
suddenly
kissed
her
you
brought
it
on
yourself
rhoda
by
looking
so
pretty
in
this
stern
old
place
of
creeds
and
catechisms
could
you
love
me
if
i
asked
you
you
could
love
me
true
william
your
heart
is
in
old
church
among
the
bats
and
foxes
where
aunt
vesty
sits
this
minute
no
my
sorrow
is
there
rhoda
i
am
trying
to
build
a
nest
for
my
heart
we
all
must
love
william
i
do
think
a
young
man
in
love
can
remember
so
much
history
when
he
sittin
in
the
dark
by
his
gal
love
among
the
ruins
is
always
melancholy
rhoda
yes
william
and
your
love
comes
out
of
the
ruins
of
your
old
first
love

could
make
you
happy

said
william
my
fancy
wavers
towards
you
you
are
a
beautiful
girl
yes
said
rhoda
practically
it
time
i
was
gittin
married
i
think
i
take
you
on
trial
and
watch
aunt
vesty
to
see
if
she
is
jealous
of
me
all
differences
of
education
passed
away
when
standing
for
a
moment
with
this
tall
willowy
girl
in
his
arms
her
ardent
nature
in
the
blush
of
uncertainty
her
very
coquetry
languishing
like
health
taking
religion
captive
the
rector
of
princess
anne
felt
that
there
is
no
medicine
for
love
but
love
they
walked
together
around
the
square
old
edifice
among
the
graves
of
tilghmans
drydens
revells
and
beauchamps
and
saw
the
windows
and
double
doors
in
arched
brick
and
passing
back
along
the
road
entered
the
enclosure
of
the
grand
old
episcopal
church
which
was
nearly
eighty
feet
long
and
presented
its
broadside
of
blackish
brick
and
double
tier
of
spacious
windows
to
the
absolute
desertion
of
this
forest
place
the
churchyard
was
a
copse
of
and
poplar
suckers
and
berry
bushes
with
and
cedars
and
wild
next
above
and
higher
still
the
damp
sycamores
and
maples
growing
out
of
myrtle
nearly
upon
the
waves
of
old
graves
in
beautiful
carpentry
the
thirteen
windows
on
this
massive
side
upheld
in
their
sashes
more
than
four
hundred
panes
of
dim
glass
and
two
great
windows
in
the
gable
had
fifty
panes
each
and
stood
firm
though
the
wall
between
them
fifty
feet
in
width
had
fallen
in
and
been
replaced
with
poorer
workmanship
in
the
opposite
gable
was
another
door
that
had
been
forced
open
and
as
they
stepped
across
the
sill
a
crack
like
ice
first
stepped
upon
went
splitting
the
long
and
lofty
vacancy
with
warning
rumbles
now
the
whole
interior
in
fine
perspective
stood
exposed
at
least
by
fifty
feet
like
a
majestic
hall
unbroken
by
any
and
with
double
stories
of
windows
shedding
a
hazy
light
and
at
the
distant
end
a
low
pulpit
with
spacious
altar
the
walls
of
this
neglected
temple
were
two
feet
thick
and
its
high
ceiling
was
kept
from
falling
down
by
ten
rude
wooden
props
of
recent
rough
carpentry
the
pews
were
stately
things
numbered
in
white
letters
on
a
black
ground
and
each
to
contain
ten
persons
the
rotting
damask
cushions
in
many
of
them
told
of
a
former
aristocracy
while
now
all
the
congregation
could
be
assembled
in
a
single
pew
and
worship
was
unknown
but
once
a
year
when
the
bishop
came
to
read
his
liturgy
to
dust
and
desolation
so
on
the
opposite
western
cape
of
the
chesapeake
shivered
the
roman
priests
of
calvert
foundation
in
the
waste
of
old
mary
the
folds
had
left
the
shepherds
and
fifty
people
only
came
to
worship
in
the
kirk
of
the
earliest
presbyterians
two
tall
once
considered
elegant
stoves
were
nearly
midway
up
the
cracking
and
mary
the
free
woman
had
made
a
fire
in
one
of
them
and
the
pine
wood
was
roaring
and
the
long
height
of
pipe
was
smoking
startled
by
the
fire
a
venerable
opossum
came
out
of
one
of
the
pews
and
waggled
down
the
aisle
like
a
gray
devotee
who
had
said
his
prayers
and
feared
no
man
vesta
was
reading
her
aloud
near
the
stove
to
the
pretty
widow
and
grandmother
tilghman
in
a
few
moments
the
young
rector
emerged
from
a
curious
old
gallery
for
black
people
by
the
door
wearing
his
surplice
and
he
read
the
service
at
the
desk
plaintive
and
simple
milburn
and
his
group
responding
in
the
room
a
thousand
might
have
worshipped
in
cousin
vesta
the
minister
said
after
the
service
miss
holland
is
going
to
try
to
love
me
milburn
may
i
address
her
she
is
a
wilful
piece
meshach
said
you
must
school
her
first
let
my
wife
give
my
consent
vesta
went
to
both
and
kissed
them
i
feel
so
much
encouraged
dear
rhoda
and
william
to
see
love
beginning
all
about
me
now
norah
if
you
could
be
just
to
james
phoebus
who
is
proving
his
love
to
you
perhaps
with
his
life
yes
that
is
a
match
i
approve
of
said
grandmother
tilghman
but
i
do
want
bill
to
marry
disappointed
men
make
rash
selections

rhoda

him
too
soon
i

tuk
him
yet

goin
teach
me
outen
the
books
and
i
teach
him
outen
the
forest
they
walked
together
to
the
river
bank
and
dennis
had
the
poor
woman
mary
tell
the
adventures
of
jimmy
phoebus
to
save
her
from
slavery
all
were
deeply
moved
now
norah
grandmother
tilghman
said
the
moment
that
man
comes
back
you
go
to
him
and
kiss
him
and
say
you
have
been
the
only
father
to
my
son
do
you
want
me
to
be
your
wife
this
world
is
made
for
marrying
norah
women
have
no
other
career
nature
does
not
value
the
brain
of
shakespeare
but
keeps
the
seed
of
every
vagrant
plant
warm
and
marries
everything
well
said
vesta
norah
loves
james
phoebus
do
you
norah
the
widow
blushed
take
him
my
pretty
neighbor
said
milburn
as
they
all
looked
at
her
she
suddenly
cried
i
want
to
indeed
i
would
have
done
so
before
but
i
am
superstitious
who
is
it
that
feeds
me
so
mysteriously
has
he
been
coming
of
late
asked
tilghman
no
not
since
you
were
married
vesta
then
i
think
it
will
come
no
more
milburn
said
you
have
waited
longer
than
i
did
his
eyes
sought
his
wife
he
added
will
i
ever
be
more
than
your
husband
yes
said
grandmother
tilghman
with
a
special
effort
when
you
wear
a
hat
a
young
wife
is
not
ashamed
of
all
felt
a
cold
thrill
at
these
words
from
the
blind
woman
milburn
said
gravely
how
can
you
know
about
hats
when
you
can
not
see
them
oh
said
grandmother
herself
a
little
frightened
that
hat
i
think
i
can
smell
that
same
night
in
princess
anne
dennis
in
her
little
cottage
undressed
herself
by
a
fragment
of
that
now
and
then
flashed
upon
the
picture
of
her
husband
as
he
had
left
her
sixteen
years
before
when
levin
was
a
baby
a
rich
blonde
youthful
man
dressed
in
naval
uniform
like
decatur
whose
birthplace
was
so
near
his
own
his
golden
hair
curled
upon
his
forehead
his
blue
eyes
were
full
of
handsome
daring
and
his
red
pouting
mouth
was
like
a
woman
upon
his
arm
a
corded
chapeau
was
held
epaulettes
tasselled
his
shoulders
his
rich
blue
coat
was
slashed
with
gold
along
the
wide
lappels
and
stood
stiffly
around
his
neck
and
fleecy
stock
and
he
seemed
to
be
a
mere
boy
but
of
the
mettle
which
made
american
officers
and
privateersmen
of
his
days
the
only
guerdons
of
the
republicanism
of
the
seas
against
the
else
universal
dominion
of
england
this
portrait
the
last
of
her
family
possessions
was
the
young
sailor
parting
gift
to
her
when
he
sailed
in
the
leaving
her
a
mere
girl
with
his
son
upon
her
breast
the
picture
hung
above
the
lowly
door
the
bolt
whereof
was
never
fastened
in
that
serene
society
and
seldom
is
to
this
day
dennis
knelt
upon
the
bare
floor
and
raised
her
branching
arms
white
as
her
spirit
to
the
lover
of
her
youth
oh
thou
i
have
adored
since
god
gave
me
to
feel
the
beauty
and
strength
of
man
in
my
childhood
if
i
have
ever
looked
on
man
but
thee
with
love
or
wavering
rebuke
me
now
for
the
offence
i
am
to
do
if
such
it
be
in
choosing
another
father
for
thy
boy
a
low
wail
seemed
to
be
breathed
upon
the
midnight
from
somewhere
near
and
a
sick
man
cough
seemed
to
break
the
perfect
silence
the
hand
instinctively
covered
her
bosom
as
she
listened
and
deep
in
the
spirit
of
her
prayer
she
continued
oh
bowie
if
thou
livest
let
me
know
may
i
not
live
to
see
thee
come
and
find
me
in
another
arms
thy
look
would
kill
me
if
thou
art
detained
by
enemies
by
savage
people
or
by
foreign
love
no
matter
what
thy
errors
i
will
still
be
true
give
me
some
token
by
the
god
that
has
thee
in
his
keeping
whether
thou
liest
on
the
ocean
floor
or
lookest
from
the
stars
if
thou
art
dead
love
of
my
youth
assure
me
oh
i
pray
thee
the
wail
and
hacking
cough
seemed
to
be
repeated
very
near
a
footstep
seemed
to
come
the
door
flew
open
and
in
the
moonlight
stood
a
man
pale
as
a
ghost
of
bandit
look
with
garments
and
head
and
neck
tied
up
with
cerements
like
wounded
people
in
the
cockpits
of
ships
of
war
he
bent
upon
her
the
eyes
of
the
portrait
above
the
door
how
changed
how
like
there
seemed
upon
his
throat
the
stain
of
blood
the
widow
fascinated
frozen
still
let
fall
her
arms
of
ivory
and
as
she
gazed
her
beautiful
neck
strained
in
horror
and
astonishment
received
upon
its
snow
the
rapture
of
diana
shine
the
effigy
so
like
her
husband
yet
so
altered
reached
towards
her
his
hand
on
which
a
diamond
caught
the
moon
and
seemed
to
drink
it
a
wail
like
the
others
she
had
heard
broke
from
his
lips
and
said
the
words
to
lose
those
charms
to
lose
that
heart
o
god
as
thus
he
stood
ghastly
and
supplicating
as
if
he
would
fall
and
die
upon
her
threshold
another
hand
came
forward
in
the
moonlight
and
drew
the
door
between
them
a
voice
she
had
not
heard
tenderly
exclaimed
i
love
him
as
i
never
loved
a
male
it
is
my
husband
spirit
the
widow
breathed
i
can
not
marry
she
swooned
upon
her
floor
before
the
dying
fire
chapter

virgie
flight
snow
hill
when
virgie
looked
forth
upon
it
almost
seemed
built
on
snow
a
white
sand
composing
the
streets
gardens
and
fields
though
the
humid
air
brought
vegetation
even
from
this
and
vines
clambered
willows
drooped
flowers
blossomed
on
winter
brink
and
great
speckled
sycamores
like
freckled
giants
and
noble
oaks
rose
to
heights
betokening
rich
nutrition
at
their
roots
heat
and
moisture
and
salt
had
made
the
land
habitable
and
the
wind
from
a
receded
sea
had
piled
up
the
sand
long
ago
into
mounds
now
covered
with
verdure
which
the
freak
or
fondness
of
the
manor
owner
had
called
a
hill
and
put
his
own
name
thereto
perhaps
with
memories
of
old
snow
hill
in
london
upon
this
apparent
bank
or
hill
two
venerable
churches
stood
both
of
english
brick
the
episcopalian
covered
with
ivy
and
the
presbyterian
which
had
given
its
name
to
the
first
synod
of
the
kirk
in
the
new
world
and
now
stood
surrounded
with
gravestones
where
the
visitor
might
read
scottish
names
left
to
orphans
at
worcester
as
yonder
at
the
episcopate
graveyard
names
left
to
english
orphans
in
the
same
rolling
tide
of
blood
and
worcester
was
the
name
of
the
county
as
the
court
and
jail
might
tell
hidden
in
the
sand
like
benjamin
cup
in
the
bag
of
flinty
corn
a
golden
lustre
yet
seemed
to
betray
snow
hill
as
the
sun
rose
into
its
old
trees
and
woke
the
birds
and
finally
made
the
old
brick
and
older
whitewashed
houses
gleam
and
exhale
a
soft
blue
smoke
virgie
heard
a
sound
as
of
hoofs
upon
a
bridge
and
saw
across
the
river
the
custis
carriage
winding
up
a
golden
road
alone
said
virgie
love
has
gone
now
i
must
live
for
freedom

spoke
a
neat
yet
ready
woman
of
virgie

size
and
color

going
to
drive

out
of
town
before

of
the
white

a
mulatto
man
whom
the
woman
introduced
as
her
husband
hudson

said

the
housewife

careful
how

would

a
pass
i

the
old
wagon
an
open
thing
to
peddle
oysters
and
fish
was
driven
across
the
town
to
the
south
and
soon
was
in
the
open
country
going
towards
virginia
a
smell
of
salt
bay
seemed
in
the
air
the
nests
in
dead
trees
indicated
the
element
that
subsisted
everything
and
the
trees
in
the
fields
were
often
lordly
in
size
though
sand
and
small
oak
and
pine
woods
were
seldom
out
of
sight
as
they
turned
into
a
lane
near
a
little
roadside
place
of
worship
a
young
white
man
rode
by
on
horseback
and
seeing
virgie
reined
in
and
shouted
purty
purty
purty
as
peaches
and
cream

the
mulatto
man
interposed
hastily
and
went
in
the
gate
while
the
horseman
with
a
shout
like
one
intoxicated
gallopped
towards
the
north
i

at
the
end
of
the
short
lane
a
house
and
porch
with
small
around
it
that
ole
spring
hill
built
by
the
first
of

of

had
ceased
to
call

virgie

if

all
i
have
got
together
an
excited
light
seemed
to
be
in
his
eyes
virgie
was
put
in
a
loft
over
the
kitchen
of
the
house
and
left
to
her
contemplations
the
place
was
nearly
dark
and
she
was
jaded
for
want
of
sleep
the
past
night
excitement
having
shaken
her
nervous
system
and
soon
she
began
to
doze
fitfully
and
dream
almost
awake
she
saw
meshach
milburn
who
seemed
to
have
become
a
little
child
reaching
up
to
an
older
person
very
like
himself
in
features
and
taking
a
steeple
hat
from
his
hand
this
older
child
reached
back
and
took
a
similar
hat
from
another
still
older
and
then
the
first
two
vanished
and
two
old
men
were
giving
and
receiving
the
hat
then
nothing
was
left
but
the
hat
alone
which
was
a
huge
object
with
fire
belching
from
it
and
by
the
flame
a
circle
of
wizards
went
round
and
round
in
dizzy
glee
all
wearing
hats
of
similar
form
but
higher
higher
till
they
reached
the
sky
and
stars
and
each
was
spouting
flames
among
these
riotous
wizards
she
recognized
the
features
of
the
tall
kidnapper
and
of
judge
custis
and
vesta
too
was
there
and
old
aunt
hominy
all
giving
a
hasty
look
of
shame
or
sorrow
or
severity
at
her
till
she
fearing
yet
fascinated
leaped
into
the
circle
and
danced
around
and
around
with
the
rest
till
her
feet
made
a
fiery
path
and
her
head
was
burning
hot
and
finally
she
lost
her
balance
and
fell
into
the
great
hat
whose
high
walls
like
mountains
surrounded
her
and
nothing
could
she
see
in
the
bottom
of
the
old
felt
tile
but
a
little
grave
and
peeping
from
it
was
the
face
of
the
murdered
child
the
kidnapper
had
taken
away
come
said
a
voice
and
virgie
awoke
with
fever
in
her
temples
and
hot
hands
to
see
the
head
of
her
conductor
looking
into
the
loft
as
if
with
eyeballs
she
only
knew
that
she
was
going
again
in
the
old
wagon
and
a
boy
was
in
it
and
that
after
a
certain
time
she
could
not
tell
how
long
she
was
helped
to
the
ground
at
an
old
landing
where
the
road
stopped
and
was
placed
on
board
a
sort
of
scow
which
the
breeze
laden
with
mosquitoes
was
carrying
into
a
broad
water
the
man
hudson
was
sounding
and
was
watching
the
sail
while
the
boy
steered
and
virgie
was
lying
sick
and
cold
in
the
middle
of
the
skiff
covered
with
the
man
large
coat
it
seemed
to
her
to
be
afternoon
and
the
ocean
somewhere
near
as
she
heard
low
thunder
like
breaking
waves
and
once
when
she
rose
in
a
stupefied
way
to
look
there
were
familiar
objects
on
both
shores
and
she
thought
it
was
the
old
town
beach
near
snow
hill
inlet
a
little
later
the
man
brought
her
oysters
and
some
cold
with
to
eat
and
the
shores
grew
closer
and
finally
seemed
almost
to
meet
as
the
skiff
scraping
the
bottom
darted
through
a
narrow
strait
then
the
stars
were
shining
over
her
and
the
waters
grew
wide
again
and
lying
in
a
trance
of
flying
lights
and
images
she
thought
she
felt
her
lips
kissed
and
a
voice
say
darling
finally
she
felt
lifted
up
and
carried
and
when
she
could
realize
the
situation
she
found
herself
lying
on
a
pile
of
shingles
at
an
old
wharf
and
the
man
beside
her
was
weeping
as
he
watched
the
boat
receding
down
a
moonlit
aisle
of
wave
my
boy
my
poor
ole
woman
she
heard
her
conductor
mutter
i
never
can
come
back
to
you
no
mo
why
spoke
virgie
hardly
realizing
what
she
said
because
because
did
it
the
man
exclaimed
with
ardent
eyes
seen
through
his
streaming
tears
oh
tell
me
where
i
am
virgie
said
is
it
far
to
freedom
now
she
looked
at
the
sky
all
agitated
with
clouds
and
stars
moving
across
each
other
and
it
seemed
the
nearest
world
of
all
is
my
father
there
thought
virgie
my
dear
white
father
can
he
see
me
here
sick
and
lonely
and
hate
me
we
at
de
shingle
landing
yonder
is
martin
said
the
negro
cautiously
there
two
roads
nigh
whar
we
air
goin
to
the
north
dear
virgie
one
is
the
and
is
the
through
the
cypress
swamp
take
the
road
that
the
safest
to
freedom
virgie
sighed
in
a
few
moments
walking
over
the
ground
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
crossed
a
sandy
road
and
went
beyond
it
along
the
edge
of
a
small
stream
the
man
walked
a
few
steps
up
the
better
road
undecidedly
and
suddenly
drew
virgie
back
into
the
bushes
but
not
quick
enough
to
be
unobserved
by
two
men
coming
on
in
an
old
rattling
wagon
my
skin
cried
the
man
driving
a
youngish
man
of
sharp
but
not
unkindly
eyes
thar
a
sniptious
gal
come
out
yer
and
show
yourself
virgie
felt
the
man
eyes
resting
on
her
but
not
with
the
coarse
ardor
of
his
companion
who
wore
a
wide
slouched
hat
and
red
shirt
and
was
bandaged
around
the
head
and
throat
yet
from
his
ghastly
pale
face
like
death
on
which
some
blood
seemed
to
be
smeared
and
to
stain
the
bandage
at
his
neck
lay
a
coarse
leer
and
he
kissed
his
mouth
at
her
and
uttered
flexuosa
esquisita
it
is
dainty
sorden
now
ef
we
was
a
going
way
van
dorn
the
driver
said
we
could
give
them
a
lift
boy
what
are
you
out
fur
where
your
passes
yer
they
is
it
my
wife
an
me
gwyn
to
nurse
a
lady
in
delaware
let
me
see
he
puffed
his
cigar
upon
the
paper
and
exclaimed
prissy
hudson
why
my
skin
that
my
wife
nurse
and
that
ai
the
same
woman
where
did
you
get
this
pass
go
on
sorden
coughed
the
other
man
i
bleeding
let
me
lie
down
his
eyes
had
lost
their
wanton
fire
and
were
hollow
and
glazing
the
driver
caught
him
in
his
arms
and
uttered
the
kind
words
i
love
him
as
i
never
loved
a
male
give
me
back
the
passes
exclaimed
the
mulatto
man
as
the
wagon
started
south
no
shouted
the
driver
i
shall
keep
them
as
evidence
against
prissy
hudson
for
assisting
a
runaway
lost
lost
muttered
the
mulatto
now
darling
the
swamp
our
only
road
he
seized
her
in
his
flight
and
pulled
her
up
the
along
the
swampy
branch
what
have
you
done
cried
virgie
come
come
answered
the
man
here
is
no
place
to
talk
with
fever
making
her
strong
and
heightening
yet
clouding
her
impressions
so
that
time
seemed
extinct
and
fear
itself
absorbed
in
frenzy
the
girl
followed
the
man
into
the
deep
sand
of
the
track
and
scarcely
noted
the
melancholy
rising
around
them
out
of
pools
that
sucked
poison
from
the
starlight
basking
there
beside
the
reptile
flowers
with
such
rich
tints
that
night
scarcely
darkened
them
sent
up
their
musky
perfumes
and
vines
in
silent
festoons
drooped
from
high
tips
of
giant
trees
like
babel
aspiring
builders
turned
back
and
stricken
dumb
they
fell
all
limp
and
hanging
there
in
death
their
beards
still
seemed
to
grow
in
the
ghastly
vitality
of
an
immortal
dream
the
sounds
of
restless
animation
intenser
in
the
night
as
if
the
moon
were
mistress
here
and
wakened
every
insect
brain
and
tongue
to
industry
grew
prodigious
in
the
sick
girl
ears
and
seemed
to
deaden
every
word
her
male
companion
had
to
say
and
like
enormous
pendulums
of
sound
the
roaming
crickets
and
amphibia
swung
to
and
fro
their
contradictions
like
viragos
doomed
to
wait
for
eternity
and
each
insist
upon
the
last
word
to
say
you
did
you
did
you
did
you
did
you
did
you
did
you
did
you
did
thus
the
eternal
quarrel
begun
before
hector
and
the
greeks
were
born
had
raged
in
the
cypress
swamp
and
increased
in
loudness
every
night
till
on
the
flying
slave
girl
ears
it
pealed
like
god
and
satan
disputing
for
her
soul
as
this
idea
increased
upon
her
fancy
she
heard
the
very
words
these
warring
powers
hurled
to
and
fro
as
now
the
myriads
of
the
angels
cheered
together
hallelujah
hallelujah
and
like
an
army
of
spiders
assembled
in
the
swamp
a
deep
refrain
of
hell
hell
hell
groaned
back
hallelujah
hell
hallelujah
she
found
herself
crying
as
she
stumbled
on
hallelujah
hallelujah
the
swamp
increased
in
depth
and
solemnity
as
they
drew
near
the
rushing
sluices
of
the
pocomoke
and
kept
along
them
the
trail
being
now
a
mere
ditch
and
chain
of
floating
logs
where
no
vehicle
could
pass
and
the
man
himself
seemed
frightened
as
he
led
the
way
from
trunk
to
float
and
puddle
to
corduroy
sometimes
balancing
himself
on
a
revolving
log
or
again
plunging
nearly
to
his
waist
in
vegetable
muck
but
the
girl
behind
had
the
footstep
of
a
bird
and
hopped
as
if
from
twig
to
twig
and
seemed
to
slide
where
he
would
sink
and
the
man
often
turned
in
terror
when
he
had
fallen
headlong
from
some
treacherous
perch
to
see
her
slender
feet
in
crescent
sandals
play
in
the
moonlit
jungle
like
hands
upon
a
harp
he
stared
at
her
in
wonder
but
too
wistfully
the
hung
across
the
opening
and
grapevines
like
cables
of
sunken
ships
fell
many
a
fathom
through
the
crystal
waves
of
night
but
the
north
star
seemed
to
find
a
way
to
peep
through
everything
and
virgie
heard
the
words
from
hudson
once
of
jess
over
this
branch
a
bit
we
is
in
delaware
then
the
crickets
and
the
bullfrogs
and
the
whippoorwills
the
owls
and
everything
seemed
to
drown
his
voice
and
halloo
for
hours
we
is
in
delaware
we
is
we
is
we
is
in
a
little
warming
kindly
light
at
length
began
to
blaze
their
trail
along
as
if
some
gentle
predecessor
with
a
golden
adze
had
chipped
the
funereal
trees
and
made
them
smile
a
welcome
small
fires
were
burning
in
the
vegetable
mould
or
surface
brush
and
the
opacity
of
the
forest
yielded
to
the
pretty
flame
which
danced
and
almost
sang
in
a
household
crackle
like
a
young
girl
in
love
humming
tunes
as
she
kindles
a
fire
the
mighty
swamp
now
grew
distinct
yet
more
inaccessible
as
its
inner
edges
seemed
transparent
in
the
line
of
fires
like
curtains
of
lace
against
the
midnight
the
virginia
creeper
light
as
the
flounces
of
a
lady
went
whirling
upward
as
if
in
a
dance
the
fallen
giant
trees
were
rich
in
hanging
moss
laurel
and
jasmine
appeared
beyond
the
bubbling
surface
of
long
green
morass
where
life
of
some
kind
seemed
to
turn
over
comfortably
in
the
rising
warmth
like
sleepers
in
bed
suddenly
the
man
took
virgie
up
and
carried
her
through
a
stream
of
running
water
brown
with
the
tannin
matter
of
the
swamp
we
is
in
delaware
he
said
soon
after
as
they
reached
a
camp
of
shingle
sawyers
all
deserted
and
lighted
by
the
fire
the
golden
chips
strewn
around
and
the
sawdust
like
indian
meal
that
suggested
good
warm
pone
at
teackle
hall
to
virgie
she
put
her
feet
soaked
with
swamp
water
at
a
burning
log
to
warm
and
hardly
saw
a
mocasson
snake
glide
round
the
fire
and
stop
as
if
to
dart
at
her
and
glide
away
for
virgie
mind
was
attributing
this
kindly
fire
to
the
presence
of
freedom
oh
i
should
like
to
lie
here
and
go
to
sleep
she
said
languidly
i
am
so
tired
the
man
hudson
wringing
wet
with
the
journey
difficulties
threw
his
arms
around
her
and
drew
her
to
his
damp
yet
fiery
breast
we
will
sleep
here
then
he
breathed
into
her
lips
i
love
you
the
incoherence
of
everything
yielded
to
these
sudden
words
and
on
the
young
maid
startled
nature
came
a
reality
she
had
not
understood
her
guide
was
drunken
with
passion
she
struggled
in
his
arms
with
all
her
might
but
was
as
a
switch
in
a
maniac
hands
i
stole
my
ole
woman
pass
fur
you
the
infatuated
ruffian
sighed
you
said
you
would
love
the
man
who
got
you
one
virgie
you
is
mine
a
suffocating
sense
and
heat
more
than
animal
nature
seemed
to
enclose
them
the
girl
struggled
free
her
lithe
figure
exerted
with
all
her
dying
strength
to
preserve
her
modesty
hudson
she
cried
i
will
tell
your
wife
god
forgive
you
for
insulting
a
poor
sick
helpless
girl
in
this
wild
swamp
my
wife
is
dead
to
me
virgie
you
is
the
only
wife
i
has
now
here
we
shall
sleep
and
forgit
my
children
and
my
little
home
that
was
enough
fur
me
gal
till
your
beauty
come
and
tuk
me
from
it
stop
the
girl
called
with
her
face
blanched
even
in
her
fever
though
not
with
fear
as
her
white
blood
rose
proudly
if
you
do
not
keep
away
i
will
throw
myself
in
that
deep
pool
and
drown
i
would
rather
die
than
cheat
your
good
wife
as
you
have
done
nothing
is
yer
the
negro
said
but
you
an
me
an
love
i
would
not
let
you
drown
you
are
too
beautiful
we
will
get
to
the
free
states
together
and
live
for
each
other
kiss
me
he
darted
upon
her
again
and
bent
her
fair
head
back
by
the
fallen
braids
of
her
silky
hair
the
tall
woods
filled
with
majestic
light
something
roared
as
if
the
winds
had
gone
astray
and
were
rushing
towards
them
hark
cried
virgie
god
is
coming
to
punish
you
as
she
spoke
the
ground
beside
them
burst
into
flames
and
black
smoke
the
man
arms
relaxed
he
looked
around
him
and
exclaimed
it
the
underground
fire
run
fur
your
life
he
led
the
way
running
to
the
north
as
they
had
been
going
in
a
moment
fire
like
a
golden
wall
rose
across
their
path
they
turned
whence
they
had
come
and
the
fire
there
was
like
a
lake
of
lava
and
over
it
the
enormous
trees
seemed
to
warm
their
hands
and
up
the
dry
vines
like
monkeys
of
flame
the
forked
spirits
of
the
burning
earth
dodged
and
chased
each
other
gal
i
ca
leave
you
to
perish
the
desperate
man
shouted
you
must
love
me
or
we
die
together
he
threw
his
wet
around
her
head
so
that
she
could
not
breathe
the
smoke
nor
spoil
her
beauty
and
dashed
into
the
fire
ahead
of
them
virgie
awoke
lying
upon
the
ground
the
stars
still
standing
in
the
sky
but
some
streaks
of
light
in
the
east
betokening
dawn
her
hands
were
full
of
soot
her
skirts
were
burned
some
smarting
pains
were
in
her
legs
and
feet
but
she
could
walk
where
is
that
poor
deluded
man
she
thought
a
groan
came
from
the
ground
and
there
lay
something
nearly
naked
burrowing
his
face
in
a
pool
of
swamp
water
thank
the
lord
you
are
not
dead
the
girl
said
but
have
lived
to
repent
and
be
a
better
man
he
rose
up
and
looked
at
her
with
a
face
all
blackened
and
raw
and
hideous
to
see
merciful
lord
exclaimed
virgie
what
ails
you
pore
man
the
lord
has
punished
me
for
my
wickedness
he
groaned
virgie
you
must
lead
me
now

asked
virgie
when
her
horror
would
permit
yes

reckon
but
both
my
eyes
is
burned
out
oh
my
pore
old
wife
she
could
nurse
me
so
well
i
have
lost
her
the
girl
comforted
the
sightless
man
and
led
him
on
indifferent
to
danger
he
waded
the
deep
places
where
the
water
soothed
his
wounds
and
filled
his
blistered
sockets
with
cool
mud
blessed
is
the
pure
in
heart
he
murmured
as
they
reached
some
sandy
ground
and
sank
down
you
virgie
can
see
god
i
never
can
the
great
cypress
swamp
of
delaware
counterpart
of
the
dismal
swamp
in
virginia
the
northern
border
of
which
they
had
now
reached
had
probably
been
once
a
great
inlet
or
shallow
bay
in
the
encroaching
of
the
peninsula
and
was
filled
with
oysters
and
fish
which
in
time
were
imprisoned
and
became
the
manure
of
a
cypress
forest
that
soon
started
up
when
springs
of
water
flowed
under
the
sand
and
moistened
the
seed
and
for
ages
these
forests
had
been
growing
and
had
been
prostrated
and
had
dropped
their
leaves
and
branches
in
the
great
inlet
bed
until
a
deep
ligneous
mass
of
combustible
stuff
raised
higher
and
higher
the
level
of
the
swamp
and
dried
with
ages
more
of
time
than
dried
the
mummies
of
the
pharaohs
it
often
opened
tunnels
to
burrowing
fire
which
at
some
point
of
its
course
belched
forth
and
lighted
the
hollow
trees
and
raged
for
weeks
such
a
fire
they
had
come
through
virgie
in
the
early
daylight
came
upon
a
small
swarthy
boy
driving
a
little
cart
and
ox
are

a
colored
boy
virgie

the
boy
proudly

up
the
blind
man
it
empty
i

die
thar
or
git
a
doctor
before
the
people
were
up
they
entered
a
little
hamlet
on
that
stage
road
from
which
they
had
made
the
night
detour
and
saw
a
few
small
houses
and
a
little
church
near
by
among
the
woods
and
one
large
house
of
a
deserted
appearance
was
at
the
town
extremity
the
man
said
this
is
john
clayton
birthplace
my
wife
used
to
work
yer
virgie
exclaimed
a
familiar
voice
the
girl
turned
her
ears
still
ringing
with
the
echoes
of
the
swamp
and
saw
a
face
she
knew
and
ran
to
the
breast
beneath
it
crying
samson
hat
oh

like
my
mother

dis
way
he
led
her
into
the
of
the
old
church
grove
where
english
worship
had
been
celebrated
just
a
hundred
years
and
she
gave
him
money
to
buy
medicine
and
get
a
doctor
for
the
blind
man
and
to
purchase
her
a
shawl
at
the
store
then
virgie
sank
into
a
fevered
sleep
under
the
old
and
when
she
knew
more
was
gliding
in
a
boat
that
samson
was
sailing
down
a
broad
piece
of
water
and
her
head
was
in
his
lap
you
air
pure
as
an
angel

asked
the
girl
wistfully
with
her
brilliant
eyes
full
of
fever
oh

die

good
that
miss
vesty

my
father

me
about
princess
anne
an
my
dear
old
marster
meshach
milburn
dat
leff
so
long
virgie
the
old
pugilist
said
wiping
his
eyes
of
tears
she
began
to
try
to
remember
but
faces
and
events
ran
into
each
other
and
she
felt
aware
that
her
mind
was
wandering
but
could
not
bring
it
back
and
so
the
boat
sailing
in
sight
of
the
ocean
and
the
stately
ships
there
grounded
after
noon
almost
within
sound
of
the
surf
sheltered
in
a
piece
of
woods
for
some
hours
virgie
found
herself
at
dark
carried
in
old
samson
arms
up
a
beach
of
the
sea
where
the
sand
was
yielding
and
seldom
firm
except
at
the
very
edge
of
the
surf
which
rolled
ominously
and
at
times
became
a
roar
and
often
swept
to
the
low
sedgy
bank
lightning
played
across
the
black
sea
lifting
it
up
as
it
seemed
and
showing
vessels
making
either
out
or
in
and
finally
thunder
burst
upon
the
gathering
confusion
and
samson
said
dar
a
gun
in
dat
thunder
the
next
flash
of
lightning
showed
a
vessel
close
to
the
shore
coming
rapidly
in
on
the
southeaster
and
her
gun
was
fired
again
and
feeble
hailing
was
heard
but
the
storm
now
broke
all
at
once
and
a
wave
threw
samson
to
the
ground
and
nearly
carried
virgie
back
with
it
to
the
boiling
sea
but
the
faithful
old
man
fought
for
her
and
she
ran
at
his
side
uttering
no
complaint
till
once
as
they
stopped
to
get
breath
and
the
heavenly
fire
drew
into
sight
every
foot
as
it
seemed
of
that
vast
ocean
cannonading
it
also
with
majestic
artillery
the
girl
sighed
freedom
is
beautiful
oh
virgie
samson
answered
covering
her
with
his
own
coat
if
i
could
buy
you
free
pore
chile
i
go
into
slavery
to
save
you
from
dis
night
i
can
die
in
there
virgie
said
pointing
to
the
waves
they
must
not
catch
me
a
wail
came
out
of
the
storm
so
close
before
that
it
hushed
them
both
and
the
lightning
lifted
upon
their
eyes
a
stranding
vessel
so
close
it
seemed
that
they
could
touch
it
and
she
was
full
of
people
hallooing
but
not
in
any
intelligible
tongue
as
the
black
night
fell
upon
this
sketch
they
heard
a
crash
of
wave
and
wood
and
falling
spars
and
awful
shrieks
and
when
the
next
vivid
flash
of
lightning
came
nothing
was
visible
but
floating
substance
and
spluttering
cries
came
out
of
the
bosom
of
the
sea
and
a
black
man
flung
as
if
out
of
a
cannon
upon
a
wave
that
drenched
these
wanderers
struck
the
ground
at
their
feet
and
looked
into
eyes
as
the
convulsion
of
death
seized
his
chest
and
feet
before
they
could
speak
to
each
other
the
beach
was
full
of
similar
corpses
a
moment
before
alive
as
themselves
and
every
one
was
naked
and
black
it
a
foundered
yer
cried
samson
he
caught
at
a
driving
past
him
in
the
many
things
that
drifted
around
their
feet
and
virgie
saw
painted
upon
its
bow
the
word
samson
she
said
feeling
all
the
influences
of
princess
anne
again
and
forgetting
her
own
misery
it
dennis
husband
come
home
and
shipwrecked
when
virgie
next
remembered
she
was
on
a
vast
hill
of
sand
near
a
lighthouse
that
was
built
upon
it
and
flashed
its
lenses
sleepily
upon
a
sullen
break
of
day
the
mutual
lights
showing
the
tops
of
trees
rising
out
of
the
sand
where
a
forest
had
been
buried
alive
like
little
twigs
in
amber
almost
naked
with
fighting
the
storm
samson
hat
slept
at
her
side
peaceful
as
hale
age
and
virtue
could
enjoy
the
balm
of
oblivion
in
life
happy
are
the
black
thought
the
sick
girl
that
take
no
thought
on
things
this
white
blood
in
me
makes
so
big
on
freedom
and
my
father
father
do
love
me
before
i
die
she
knelt
on
the
great
sand
hillock
by
cape
henlopen
and
prayed
till
she
too
lost
her
knowledge
of
self
and
was
sleeping
again
at
side
she
dreamed
of
innumerable
angels
flying
all
around
her
and
yet
their
voices
were
so
harsh
they
awoke
her
at
last
and
still
these
seraphs
were
flying
in
the
day
she
saw
their
wings
and
moved
the
old
man
at
her
side
to
say
samson
why
can
not
these
angels
sing
the
old
man
looked
up
and
faintly
smiled
poor
virgie
dey
is
all
bewildered
by
dat
storm
geese
and
swans
dey
ca
sing
like
angels
yes
said
the
girl
something
sings
i
know
what
is
it
jesus
maybe
the
negro
answered
looking
at
her
his
eyes
full
of
tears
the
great
breakwater
which
required
forty
years
and
nearly
a
million
tons
of
stone
to
build
it
was
then
just
commencing
and
where
it
was
to
be
within
the
shallow
bight
of
henlopen
they
saw
the
wrecks
of
many
vessels
some
sunken
some
shattered
in
collision
some
stranded
in
the
marsh
proving
the
needs
of
commerce
for
such
a
work
and
also
the
fury
of
the
storm
that
had
so
innocently
vanished
like
a
sleeping
tiger
after
his
bloody
meal
in
the
gentle
sunshine
floated
the
american
flag
upon
several
vessels
there
the
flag
that
first
kissed
the
breeze
upon
that
spot
in
the
year
when
esek
hopkins
raised
over
the
the
dyes
of
the
peach
and
cream
in
the
centre
of
his
little
squadron
and
there
along
the
low
bluff
of
the
kill
still
lay
the
town
of
lewes
in
the
torpor
of
nearly
two
hundred
years
or
since
the
dutch
de
vries
had
settled
it
in
lord
delaware
argall
and
the
swede
penn
blackbeard
paul
jones
lord
rodney
a
thousand
heroes
had
known
it
well
the
pilots
like
had
their
nests
there
the
marylanders
had
invaded
it
the
tories
had
seized
it
pirates
had
been
suckled
there
and
now
the
courts
and
lawyers
had
forsaken
it
to
go
inland
to
georgetown
virgie
said
samson
i
try
to
buy
some
of
de
captains
to
carry
you
to
phildelfy
he
waded
the
kill
carrying
her
and
left
her
in
an
old
presbyterian
church
at
the
skirt
of
lewes
and
procured
medicine
for
her
and
then
labored
in
vain
nearly
all
day
to
get
her
passage
to
a
free
state
the
reply
was
invariable
ca
take
the
risk
of
the
and
pillory
for
no
nigger
ca
lose
a
long
job
like
bringin
stone
to
the
breakwater
to
save
one
nigger
at
the
hotel
a
colored
man
beckoned
samson
aside
a
man
of
a
gingerbread
color
and
they
went
into
the
little
old
disused
in
the
middle
of
a
street
where
there
was
a
fire
brother
said
the
stranger

by
your
actions
that

to
git
a
passage

samson
said
taking
an
inventory
of
the
other
fine
chest
and
strength
and
mentally
wishing
to
have
a
chance
at
him
i
a
free
man
and

camden
only
thirty
miles
off
i

free
passes

brother
no
more
concern
samson
looked
at
the
handsome
person
long
and
well
the
man
stood
the
gaze
modestly
oh
if
i
had
some
knowledge
spoke
samson
i
might
as
well
be
a
slave
if
i
know
nothin

my
body

if
i

a
severe
oath
said
the
stranger
but
i
see
your
kind
interest
in
the
lady
indeed
i
only
doing
my
duty
he
repeated
the
words
however
and
samson
added
god
deal
with
you
sam
ogg
as
you
keep
dat
oath
now
come
with
me
the
girl
was
found
asleep
but
delirious
her
large
eyes
in
which
the
blue
and
brown
tints
met
in
a
kind
of
lake
color
being
wide
open
and
almost
lost
in
their
long
lashes
while
flood
and
fire
sun
and
frost
had
beaten
upon
the
slender
encasement
of
her
gentle
life
that
still
kept
time
like
some
parian
clock
saved
from
a
conflagration
in
whose
crystal
pane
the
golden
pendulum
still
moves
though
the
hands
point
astray
in
the
mutilated
face
her
teeth
were
shown
through
the
loving
lips
she
parted
in
her
stormy
dreams
like
waves
tossing
the
alabaster
sails
of
the
nautilus
or
like
some
ear
of
indian
corn
exposed
in
the
gale
that
blows
across
the
tasselled
field
her
raiment
partly
torn
from
her
showed
her
supple
figure
and
neck
and
beneath
her
mass
of
silky
hair
her
white
arm
like
an
ivory
serpent
sustained
her
head
her
handsome
feet
being
fine
and
like
the
soul
that
bounded
in
her
maiden
ambition
there
had
been
days
when
such
as
she
called
antony
away
from
his
wife
and
cæsar
from
his
classical
selfishness
when
on
many
an
eastern
throne
such
beauty
as
this
stirred
to
murmurous
glory
armies
beyond
compute
and
clashed
the
cymbals
of
prodigious
conquests
she
lay
upon
the
of
the
church
like
young
isaac
upon
his
father
altar
and
where
the
mourners
knelt
to
pray
for
god
reconcilement
the
cruelty
of
their
law
flashed
over
her
like
abraham
superstitious
knife
priceless
was
this
young
creature
in
noble
hands
as
wife
or
daughter
human
food
or
fair
divinity
and
all
the
precious
mysteries
of
woman
awake
in
her
to
love
and
conjugality
like
song
and
seed
in
the
spring
bird
yet
a
hard
steely
prejudice
had
shut
her
out
from
every
institution
and
equality
let
every
crime
be
perpetrated
upon
her
made
the
scent
of
freedom
in
her
nostrils
worse
than
the
incentive
of
the
thief
and
has
outlasted
her
half
a
century
and
is
and
inflexible
yet
in
that
old
churchyard
that
enclosed
her
slept
revolutionary
officers
who
helped
to
gain
freedom
they
might
be
willing
to
rise
with
her
not
to
be
buried
in
the
same
enclosure
how
small
is
religion
how
false
democracy
how
far
off
are
the
judgments
of
heaven
there
stood
over
the
pulpit
an
inscription
itself
presumptuous
with
aristocracy
saying
the
dead
in
christ
shall
rise
first
as
if
those
truly
dead
in
the
humility
of
christ
would
not
prefer
to
rise
last
samson
watched
his
new
friend
narrowly
whose
countenance
was
profoundly
piteous
and
his
teeth
and
lip
made
a
satisfied
with
the
man
samson
knelt
by
virgie
and
kissed
her
once
pore
rose
of
slavery
said
samson
forgive
me
dat
i
courted
you
like
a
gal
instead
of
like
an
angel
i
am
old
and
ashamed
of

holy
temple

said
the
man
as
samson
sat
bowed
and
weeping
the
buggy
is
ready
i
wrap

warm
miss

feminine
voice

my
occupation

been
marrying

it
is
true
that
the
has
made
that
branch
dull
but
i
had
great
talent
for
it
kidnapping
said
a
third
voice
is
running
low
it
surrounds
the
whole
slave
belt
from
illinois
to
delaware
the
laws
of
illinois
were
made
in
our
interests
till
governor
harrison
whose
free
man
was
kidnapped
raised
an
excitement
out
there
six
years
ago
newt
wright
joe
and
abe
thomas
were
the
smartest
kidnappers
along
the
kentucky
line
but
joe
johnson
who
is
getting
ready
to
go
south
will
be
the
last
man
of
enterprise
in
the
business
john
murrell
idea
is
to
divide
fair
with
black
men
sell
and
steal
them
back
and
i
think
it
is
sagacious
it
safer
any
way
than
patty
cannon
other
plan
what
is
that
mr
ogg
said
the
negro
making
away
with
the
they
say
see
me
see
me
exclaimed
the
first
voice
dey
hang
her
some
day
fur
dat
now
resumed
ogg
a
man
of
intelligence
like
you
and
me
mr
ransom
pardon
sir
does
your
shackle
incommode
you
i
stuff
it
with
some
wool
politely
ogg
i
ironed
rather
too
tight
i
say
mr
ransom
you
and
i
can
always
play
the
average
slaveholder
for
a
fool
why
i
hardly
get
into
any
family
before
i
make
love
to
some
member
of
it
and
if
i
do
vamose
with
a
black
wench
it
with
her
mistress
ah
ogg
they
are
perfectly
fiendish
in
resenting
of
course
but
there
a
grand
going
through
all
nature
why
sir
the
pleasures
of
the
far
south
to
a
man
of
art
and
enterprise
like
you
far
exceed
this
poor
plain
region
take
the
roof
off
slavery
and
the
blacks
have
rather
the
best
of
it
the
whites
would
think
so
if
they
could
see
what
is
going
on
politely
ogg
will
not
the
entire
institution
some
day
blow
itself
out
like
one
of
their
western
steamboats
no
doubt
of
it
mr
ransom
when
we
have
disposed
of
you
and
you
can
see
the
country
for
yourself
observe
how
sensitive
slaveholding
is
a
thousand
anxieties
lie
in
it
they
believe
in
insurrections
rapes
and
incendiaries
a
perfect
sleep
they
hardly
know
but
go
prowling
around
night
and
day
driven
by
their
suspicions
it
makes
them
warlike
yet
unhappy
and
the
slaves
eat
the
ground
poor
besides
they
have
terrible
enemies
in
the
whom
they
look
down
on
socially
and
really
drive
them
into
sympathy
with
the
negroes
murrell
for
instance
has
a
grand
plan
for
a
slave
insurrection
he
says
white
society
is
all
against
him
and
he
get
even
with
it

politely
gentlemen
said
the
individual
with
the
shackle
have
you
heard
of
the
incendiary
proclamation
issued
in
boston
by
david
walker
telling
all
slaves
that
it
is
their
religious
duty
to
rise
yes
and
rise
they
will
but
to
what
end
it
will
be
a
big
scare
but
no
war
the
next
thing
they
will
stop
reading
among
all
slaves
prevent
emancipation
by

and
watch

buried

the
amount

your

you
have
been
sold
and
run

in
nearly
every
slave
state

they
not
kidnapping
white
men
too
who
is
this
morgan
that
was
stolen
last
year
in
the
state
of
new
york
oh
that
a
renegade
free
mason
mr
ransom
as
much
fuss
is
made
over
him
as
if
we
did
not
steal
a
hundred
free
people
every
day
it
only
shows
that
kidnapping
of
all
sorts
is
getting
to
be
unpopular
if
a
new
political
party
can
be
made
on
stealing
one
white
morgan
do
you
think
another
party
will
some
day
rise
on
stealing
several
millions
of
black
morgans
see
me

me
exclaimed
the
hoarse
voice
suddenly
escaping
are
you
cried
the
second
voice
politely
gentlemen
politely
was
heard
from
the
third
voice
some
distance
off
in
the
dark
and
then
chasing
footsteps
followed
and
virgie
arose
and
peeped
below
a
fire
was
burning
in
a
clay
chimney
beside
a
table
on
which
were
meat
and
liquor
the
girl
swung
herself
out
of
the
loft
to
the
and
seizing
the
meat
and
bread
rushed
noiselessly
into
the
night
she
hardly
knew
what
she
was
doing
until
she
had
crossed
a
bridge
and
come
to
the
edge
of
a
small
town
around
which
she
took
a
road
to
the
right
that
led
into
another
country
road
and
this
she
followed
a
mile
or
more
till
she
saw
a
small
brick
house
by
a
stile
and
in
the
edge
of
woods
the
light
from
a
little
in
the
garret
beamed
so
brightly
that
it
charmed
virgie
soul
with
the
fascination
of
warmth
and
home
and
without
thinking
she
crossed
the
stile
bathed
her
hot
temples
at
the
well
and
walked
into
the
kitchen
before
the
fire
freedom

the
boy
said
not
a
particle
disturbed
as
two
frightened
blacks
dropped
from
the
loft
with
handcuffs
upon
them
in
the
clear
evening
a
wagon
sped
along
towards
the
east
through
the
saffron
marshes
tramping
down
the
stickweed
and
ironweed
and
the
golden
rod
and
while
the
people
in
it
cowered
close
the
negro
driver
sang
as
carelessly
as
if
he
was
the
lord
of
the
country
de

of

dat

an

de
folks
is
truly
shifless
on
tuckyhoe
side
of
de
bay
a
sail
was
seen
in
the
starlight
rising
out
of
the
marshes
at
an
old
landing
in
the
last
elbow
of
jones
creek
and
hardly
had
the
fugitives
been
put
on
board
when
the
anchor
was
weighed
and
the
packet
stood
out
for
the
broad
delaware
her
captain
a
negro
her
owner
a
quaker
the
girl
was
awakened
by
the
cold
air
of
the
bay
striking
her
face
freedom
she
murmured
it
must
be
this
oh
i
am
faint
for
arms
to
take
me
was
this
teackle
hall
that
virgie
looked
upon
a
square
bright
room
and
her
bed
beside
a
window
and
below
her
stretching
streets
of
cobblestone
and
brick
and
roofs
of
houses
to
green
marshes
filled
with
cows
and
a
river
that
seemed
blue
as
heaven
which
sipped
it
from
above
like
a
boy
drinking
head
downward
in
a
spring
how
beautiful
it
must
be
freedom
virgie
thought
but
why
was
she
so
cold
her
eyes
looking
around
the
room
fell
upon
a
lady
in
a
cap
reading
a
tract
to
a
large
shaven
man
and
this
woman
was
of
a
silver
kind
of
beauty
as
if
her
mind
had
overflowed
into
her
heart
and
not
affecting
it
had
made
her
face
of
argent
and
lily
milk
and
sheen
what
sayeth
brother
elias
lucretia
he
sayeth
thomas
noble
testimony
of
refusing
to
partake
of
the
spoils
of
oppression
lies
with
the
dearly
beloved
young
people
of
this
day
we
can
look
for
but
little
from
the
aged
who
have
been
accustomed
to
these
things
like
second
nature
without
justice
there
can
be
no
virtue
oh
justice
justice
how
art
thou
abused
everywhere
men
make
justice
like
a
nose
of
wax
to
satisfy
their
desires
if
the
soul
is
possessed
of
love
there
is
quietness
yes
said
the
girl
from
the
bed
thinking
aloud
love
is
quietness
will
father
come
she
dreamed
and
heard
and
looked
forth
again
upon
the
hill
descending
to
the
river
the
stately
sails
the
farther
shore
so
like
her
native
region
and
asked
with
her
eyes
what
land
they
might
be
in
wilmington
said
the
beautiful
woman
this
is
the
house
of
thomas
garrett
the
friend
of
slaves
when
you
can
be
moved
it
shall
be
to
the
green
hills
of
the
brandywine
where
all
are
free
hills
what
are
they
mused
virgie
looking
at
her
wasted
hand
must
i
climb
any
more
must
i
wade
the
swamps
again
i
know
i
have
a
father
somewhere
she
dreamed
and
wept
unconsciously
and
told
of
many
things
at
teackle
hall
being
indeed
a
little
child
again
playing
with
her
little
mistress
vesta
the
stars
stood
in
the
sky
right
over
her
pillow
and
she
talked
to
them
and
some
she
seemed
to
know
as
little
vince
or
little
roxy
or
master
willy
tilghman
all
playmates
of
her
childhood
but
ever
and
anon
these
vanished
and
the
young
quaker
woman
was
reading
again
from
the
sermons
of
elias
hicks
and
the
words
were
love
is
quietness
light
only
can
qualify
the
soul
if
i
go
not
away
the
comforter
will
not
come
unto
you
what
comforter
sighed
virgie
and
there
seemed
a
great
blank
and
then
she
heard
a
scream
was
it
she
that
screamed
so
and
she
was
trying
with
all
her
might
to
get
somewhere
and
was
fainting
in
the
labor
but
trying
again
and
again
and
then
a
calmness
that
was
like
gentle
awe
strange
because
so
painless
spread
into
her
nature
and
she
only
listened
my
daughter
said
a
voice
my
own
child
call
me
and
say
i
am
forgiven
father
forgiven
she
murmured
and
felt
a
warm
face
that
yet
could
not
warm
her
own
shedding
tears
and
kissing
her
and
close
to
it
her
arms
were
thrown
tight
as
if
she
never
could
let
go
and
everything
was
music
but
wonderful
she
feared
she
must
fall
if
she
did
not
hold
to
him
who
was
it
that
called
her
daughter
why
came
those
cold
stars
so
close
as
if
to
spy
upon
him
oh
holy
purity
that
held
so
fast
and
did
not
know
but
trusted
nature
quivering
embrace
she
wrestled
with
something
like
a
rock
of
ice
to
move
her
eyes
and
see
or
ere
she
was
dashed
down
forever
the

brought
the
news
of
the
repulse
from

and
the
wounding
of

tacker

furiously
arrested
i
cried
boldly
van
dorn
hit
in
the
throat
he
not
talk
much
then
muttered
the
woman
his
time
had
to
come
where
will
i
find
another
lover
at
my
age
why
honey
she
chuckled
to
herself
in
a
that
son
of
may
come
back
he
took
a
shine
to
huldy
why
not
to
me
at
the
idea
another
hideous
thought
came
to
her
mind
to
settle
fate
in
her
young
lover
absence
and
monopolize
the
corrupting
power
over
levin
dennis
if
he
ever
lived
to
see
johnson
again
as
individual
fugitives
returned
confirming
the
decisive
repulse
of
the

patty
cannon
face
grew
dark
and
her
oaths
low
and
deep
cyrus
james
heard
her
say
if
i
could
only
hang
some
one
for
this
joe
johnson
the
sneak
that

not
go

hanged

better
aunt

i
love
your
grandchild
huldy
cy
james
ventured
to
say
the
captain
wounded
and
joe
going
away
to
floridy
maybe
i
kin
git
you
up
another
band
without
an
instant
consideration
of
this
ambitious
proposition
cannon
threw
cy
james
by
main
strength
through
the
window
of
her
bar
into
her
kitchen
and
he
bawled
like
a
baby
yet
came
out
of
his
grief
muttering
ploughin
ploughin
i
make
her
into
batter
and
fry
her
yet
with
this
reflection
james
hid
himself
for
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
in
some
secluded
part
of
the
hotel
johnson
cannon
however
had
instantly
resumed
her
monologue
on
business
they
all
think
to
give
the
old
woman
the
a
sick
man
no
good
and
there
that
wife
of
van

more
niggers
money
is
what
i
need
to
put

a
bold
front
huldy
must
fetch
it
with
this
resolution
patty
cannon
mounted
the
stairs
to
a
room
on
the
second
floor
and
without
knocking
pushed
her
way
in
a
man
of
a
voluptuous
form
and
face
like
one
overfed
yet
on
the
best
and
with
stiff
military
shoulders
and
of
colors
warm
in
tint
yet
cold
in
expression
blue
eyes
and
rich
cheeks
and
lips
that
still
seemed
hard
and
spoke
up
at
once
always
knock
patty
it
more
conservative

way
in
life
is
to
reach
my
point

for
baltimore
cunnil
mclane

soon

thousand
dollars

dame
van
dorn

lucky
heigh
he
gave
her
a
vitreous
smile
and
watched
her
over
his
round
paunch
on
which
a
crystal
hung
like
a
more
human
eye
than
his
own
her
color
began
to
rise

the
sneaking
pains
that
old
men
take
to
look
benevolent
when
youth

beauty

fur

and
how
they
pet
it
to
keep

pure
fur
their
own
selfish
enjoyment
god

i
do
patty
you
shock
me
the
rubicund
gentleman
observed
i
have
always
found
you
conservative
before
now
go
and
send
sweet
hulda
here
and
for
heaven
sake
patty
do
reveal
this
bargain
to
her
is
it
a
bargain
cunnil
it
is
if
she
can
be
made
willing
to
it
that
she
shall
or
make
her
bed
in
the
forest
where
good
looks
are
not
safe
around
yer
hulda
was
found
at
a
window
looking
out
upon
her
former
home
and
at
a
ploughman
who
had
nearly
completed
the
furrows
in
a
large
field
sparing
only
some
low
places
piled
with
brush
over
one
of
which
some
buzzards
circled
lofty
yet
intent
as
anglers
watching
their
tackle
hard
as
that
home
had
been
to
hulda
she
regretted
leaving
it
for
this
tavern
where
her
grandmother
saucy
temperament
found
so
many
incentives
to
bravado
and
her
caution
that
had
to
be
exercised
in
delaware
was
quite
unnecessary
on
the
maryland
side
of
the
line
at
the
little
white
cottage
hulda
had
felt
a
sense
of
privacy
pleasing
to
her
growing
life
and
her
ability
to
read
often
charmed
patty
cannon
to
a
stillness
that
was
like
the
hyena
sleep
and
even
made
her
acquiescent
and
cordial
but
where
she
met
men
alone
unmodified
by
modest
women
example
the
bold
tendency
of
patty
was
to
men
and
lead
them
on
to
audacities
they
would
have
feared
to
follow
in
but
for
her
courage
and
policy
for
she
could
coax
either
young
or
coarse
natures
as
well
as
she
could
drive
these
feats
of
strength
and
cunning
statecraft
and
desperation
reminded
hulda
of
a
book
she
had
read
about
the
norman
knights
in
england
kidnapping
and
robbing
the
poor
saxons
and
one
description
of
king
william
the
conqueror
suggested
to
hulda
that
he
was
perhaps
a
patty
cannon
in
his
times
as
his
body
and
legs
were
short
and
powerful
like
hers
and
he
could
bend
a
bow
riding
on
horseback
that
no
other
knight
could
bend
on
foot
with
the
legs
planted
firmly
he
could
not
read
nor
write
and
was
superstitious
yet
cruel
as
the
grave
all
this
was
true
of
patty
cannon
whose
feat
of
standing
in
a
bushel
measure
and
putting
three
hundred
pounds
of
grain
on
her
shoulder
has
been
related
she
often
wrestled
and
bound
without
assistance
strong
black
men
fighting
for
their
liberties
she
could
ride
horseback
sitting
like
men
in
a
way
to
make
joan
of
arc
seem
a
maid
of
mere
tinsel
hulda
was
dressed
in
her
best
clothes
her
hair
was
tied
in
wide
braids
her
fine
features
and
large
tender
yet
seeking
gray
eyes
never
had
been
turned
on
patty
cannon
so
directly
her
grandmother
abandoned
in
a
moment
an
attempt
to
be
complaisant
and
sternly
ordered
her
to
attend
to
colonel
mclane
chamber
i
can
support
you
no
longer
huzzy
said
the
woman
her
cheeks
full
of
blood
make
haste
to
find
some
easy
life
or
joe
shall
get
you
a
husband
we
are
ruined
you
must
make
money
do
you
hear
here
is
money
grandma
said
hulda
producing
some
of
the
shillings
of
at
the
first
glance
of
these
patty
cannon
turned
pale
but
in
an
instant
the
hot
blood
rushed
to
her
face
again
and
she
swore
a
dreadful
oath
and
chased
hulda
with
uplifted
hands
into
the
chamber
of
allan
mclane
ah
hulda
inflaming
your
poor
grandmother
again
said
that
carefully
clad
and
gentleman
now
now
lovely
girl
it
not
conservative
honor
thy
father
and
mother
and
grandmother
of
course
did
i
teach
you
that
what
is
it
to
be
conservative
hulda
asked
sitting
before
the
fire
while
the
colonel
ran
over
her
straight
feet
and
tall
willowy
figure
and
stopped
a
little
chilled
by
her
clear
dewy
eyes
conservative
why
it
never
to
rush
on
anything
to
oppose
rushing
to
to
be
a
bulwark
against
innovations
to
prefer
something
you
have
tried
and
know
like
you
asked
hulda
yes
your
benefactor
instead
of
having
some
impulsive
passion
of
course
you
never
loved
in
this
place
it
is
the
only
place
i
know
to
be
conservative
as
you
call
it
i
must
take
my
life
and
opportunity
as
i
find
them
like
something
i
have
tried
and
know
ah
hulda
i
see
you
have
a
radical
perverse
something
in
you
to
twist
my
meaning
so
close
you
do
not
belong
to
this
vile
spot
except
by
consanguinity
it
would
be
perfectly
conservative
for
you
to
look
to
a
better
settlement
you
have
hinted
that
before
hulda
said
serene
in
his
presence
as
a
young
woman
used
to
proposals
i
do
want
to
change
this
life
but
i
can
not
do
it
and
be
conservative
i
must
fasten
upon
a
free
impulse
a
natural
chance
of
some
kind
god
has
kept
my
heart
pure
in
this
dreadful
place
where
i
was
born
why
are
you
here
if
you
are
conservative
it
is
not
a
gentleman
resort
he
grew
a
little
angry
at
this
thrust
but
she
continued
to
look
at
him
quietly
unaware
that
she
was
impertinent
i
often
have
business
hulda
with
joe
and
patty
negroes
are
very
high
and
we
must
buy
them
where
they
are
to
be
had
but
a
deepening
religious
interest
in
you
often
attracts
me
here
why
religious
as
well
as
conservative
sir
i
have
been
afraid
that
the
sights
you
see
here
after
the
good
instructions
i
have
given
you
might
make
you
an
infidel
what
is
an
infidel
one
who
being
unable
to
explain
certain
evils
in
life
refuses
to
believe
anything
that
is
the
case
with
van
dorn
a
very
bad
man
stepfather
joe
is
always
conservative
on
that
subject
deviate
as
much
as
he
may
he
never
disbelieves
aunt
patty
too
erratic
as
she
is
holds
a
conservative
position
on
a
great
first
cause
here
mclane
drew
out
his
gold
spectacles
and
turned
the
leaves
of
his
bible
over
and
pointed
hulda
a
place
to
read
beginning
the
fool
hath
said
in
his
heart
there
is
no
god
at
his
command
she
read
it
with
faith
yet
observation
her
mind
being
fully
alert
to
the
warning
van
dorn
had
left
her
that
in
his
absence
her
great
trial
was
to
be
mclane
was
wearing
a
gray
english
suit
with
full
round
paunch
sleek
all
over
the
body
his
hair
a
little
gray
his
gold
glasses
dangling
in
his
hand
patent
varnished
slippers
and
silk
stockings
and
a
silk
scarf
and
cameo
pin
in
it
and
a
cameo
of
his
deceased
sister
upon
his
marking
his
attire
his
eyes
of
a
pop
kind
much
too
far
forward
and
blue
as
old
china
and
yet
an
animal
not
a
spiritual
blue
the
tint
of
not
of
distance
a
somewhere
in
his
talk
though
the
fulness
of
his
very
red
lips
hardly
allowed
place
for
it
and
his
nose
and
brows
stern
and
military
as
if
he
had
been
a
pudding
stamped
with
the
die
of
a
roman
emperor
or
general
jackson
he
watched
her
reading
with
censorship
yet
desire
patronage
and
oiliness
together
glancing
up
when
she
had
read
far
enough
hulda
thought
he
was
looking
at
her
as
if
she
was
some
rarer
kind
of
negress
beautifully
read
hulda
i
never
go
to
such
places
as
theatres
but
you
might
be
i
should
say
an
actress
do
think
of
it
however
very
unconservative
profession
i
take
great
pride
in
you
my
lovely
girl
suppose
i
take
you
home
with
me
he
walked
to
her
stool
and
laid
his
warm
hand
on
her
neck
standing
behind
her
she
did
not
move
nor
change
color
something
has
happened
to
me
colonel
mclane
hulda
spoke
clear
as
a
bell
out
of
a
prison
to
make
even
johnson
cross
roads
good
and
happy
can
you
guess
what
it
is
she
bent
her
head
back
and
looked
up
fearlessly
at
him
as
if
he
were
the
negro
now
not
religious
ecstasy
he
said
not
or
revival
conversion
i
hope
that
vile
no
colonel
it
is
knowing
a
pure
young
man
whose
love
for
me
is
natural
and
unselfish
great
god
spoke
mclane
removing
his
hand
not
some
kidnapper
no
hulda
said
no
of
any
kind
they
can
not
make
him
so
he
is
perfectly
conservative
colonel
as
to
that
vileness
i
believe
he
is
a
gentleman
too
you
must
have
great
experience
in
that
article
he
sneered
looking
angry
at
her
i
have
seen
you
and
my
lover
you
have
the
best
clothes
and
profess
more
he
has
a
nature
that
your
opportunities
would
bring
real
refinement
from
he
respects
me
wretched
as
i
am
i
read
it
in
his
eyes
you
are
looking
for
a
way
to
degrade
me
in
my
own
feelings
yet
to
deceive
me
can
you
be
a
gentleman
she
was
serene
as
if
she
had
said
nothing
though
she
rose
up
and
stood
at
one
side
of
the
fireplace
opposite
him
between
them
was
a
print
of
general
jackson
riding
over
the
british
in
that
moment
allan
mclane
felt
that
the
girl
was
cheap
at
her
grandmother
figure
he
had
always
conceived
her
a
flexible
peculiar
child
in
a
few
minutes
she
had
grown
years
and
become
a
rare
and
nearly
stately
woman
not
now
to
be
moulded
but
to
be
tempted
with
large
worldly
propositions
may
i
ask
who
this
lover
is
that
i
am
so
much
beneath
hulda
i
who
have
taught
you
the
accomplishments
you
chastise
me
with
i
found
you
sand
i
made
you
crystal
he
drew
out
a
large
pongee
handkerchief
and
really
dropped
some
tears
into
it
she
continued
cool
and
unmoved
my
love
is
levin
dennis
from
princess
anne
i
am
not
afraid
to
tell
it
why
because
i
want
his
danger
and
mine
to
be
fully
known
to
him
and
make
him
a
man
the
colonel
folded
his
pongee
and
came
again
to
hulda
side
that
dissipated
boy
oh
hulda
where
is
your
real
pride
he
has
abandoned
his
mother
he
is
a
poor
gypsy
no
i
must
save
you
from
such
a
mistake
it
is
my
duty
to
do
it
i
thank
you
for
teaching
me
whatever
made
you
do
it
if
i
could
awaken
in
you
some
unselfishness
towards
me
and
my
new
love
sir
it
would
be
the
greatest
gratitude
i
could
show
you
you
conceal
so
many
hard
bad
things
under
your
word
that
the
gentle
feelings
like
forgiveness
have
forsaken
you
i
fear
no
the
colonel
said
stiffly
his
shoulders
becoming
more
military
insults
to
my
honor
i
never
forgive
people
who
do
not
resent
have
no
conservative
principle
i
forgive
as
i
hope
to
be
forgiven
joe
aunt
patty
van
dorn
and
you
i
hope
pity
and
mercy
and
sweet
unselfish
love
such
as
i
think
mine
is
may
grow
in
all
of
you
oh
colonel
she
turned
to
him
earnestly
and
raising
her
hands
to
impress
him
he
merely
noted
the
elegance
of
her
wrists
and
brown
arms
the
buying
and
selling
of
these
human
beings
makes
everybody
unfeeling
it
is
stealing
their
souls
and
bodies
whether
they
be
bought
at
the
or
kidnapped
on
the
roads
my
dream
of
joy
is
to
have
a
husband
who
will
work
with
his
own
free
hands
and
till
his
little
farm
and
sail
his
vessel
without
a
slave
above
that
i
expect
and
ask
nothing
from
the
dear
god
who
has
so
long
been
my
protector

mclane
said
drawing
her
towards
him
the
refinements
i
do
not
care
about
be
mine
the
girl
allowed
herself
to
be
brought
nearly
to
his
side
and
as
he
bent
to
kiss
her
with
his
large
complacent
lips
she
glided
from
his
hands
i
could
never
stoop
said
hulda
to
be
even
the
wife
of
a
negro
dealer
he
colored
to
the
eyes
yet
with
admiration
of
her
almost
aristocratic
composure
you
could
not
stoop
to
me
he
said
not
from
your
father
gallows
no
he
was
a
robber
but
a
bold
one
you
only
receive
the
goods
she
was
gone
and
he
stood
with
evil
lights
in
his
face
but
no
shame
he
drank
some
brandy
from
a
flask
and
murmured
now
i
have
an
insult
to
revenge
as
well
as
a
fancy
to
be
gratified
her
father
must
have
been
a
cool
rogue
well
everything
has
to
be
done
by
force
here
patty
cannon
shall
see
my
gold
chapter
xli
aunt
patty
last
trick
opposite
mclane
room
was
the
vestibule
to
the
in
the
garret
a
room
van
dorn
usually
slept
in
with
her
emotions
profoundly
excited
though
she
had
not
revealed
them
her
modesty
having
received
a
stab
that
now
brought
bitter
tears
to
her
eyes
and
blushes
unseen
except
by
the
angels
whose
white
wings
had
hidden
them
from
her
tempter
vesta
fled
into
this
room
to
deliberate
upon
her
dire
extremity
three
persons
only
were
now
in
the
house
each
one
an
interested
party
in
her
ruin
the
man
she
had
left
and
cy
james
who
was
full
of
cowardly
passion
for
her
and
patty
cannon
who
in
her
present
frame
of
mind
would
gloat
to
see
hulda
virtue
sacrificed
as
something
inconsequential
and
merry
and
heartless
perhaps
i
can
fly
to
our
old
house
across
the
state
line
and
take
refuge
with
the
new
tenant
there
hulda
thought
oh
i
wish
van
dorn
was
here
he
is
so
brave
and
when
he
left
me
his
kiss
was
like
my
father
chains
clanked
and
the
drone
of
low
hymns
came
down
the
hatchway
from
the
there
is
a
white
man
up
there
hulda
reflected
dare
i
go
up
to
see
she
unlocked
the
padlock
and
stepped
up
the
ladder
at
the
pen
door
she
peeped
but
could
not
make
out
anything
in
the
blackness
then
she
pulled
the
peg
out
of
the
staple
and
walked
into
the
sickly
odor
of
the
jail
how
many
are
here
hulda
asked
i
hear
you
but
can
not
see
three
men
one
old
woman
and
some
little
things
makes
the
present
contents
of
pangymonum
spoke
up
a
rough
cheery
voice
an
by
smoke
it
jess
enough
is
it
the
white
man
that
talks
he
says
he
white
but
they
think
it
goin
to
be
easy
to
pass
him
off
for
a
nigger
her
eyes
soon
recognized
the
speaker
as
he
said

smoke

a
johnson

reckon

huldy

around
him
thank

she
said

hulda
descended
the
ladder
in
time
to
surprise
cy
james
coming
up
he
bent
his
goose
neck
down
as
he
leaned
his
hands
upon
his
knees
and
looking
up
into
her
face
ejaculated
by
smoke
and
pangymonum
too
samson
said

in
blank
monologue
out
of
the
background
he
tuk
dat
debbil
hat
chillen
an
measured
us
in
wid
little
vessy
that
evening
there
was
a
long
free
conference
between
samson
and
patty
cannon
in
her
kitchen
next
to
the
bar
where
hulda
heard
laughing
and
invitations
to
drink
and
all
the
sounds
of
perfect
equality
the
negro
piquant
sayings
and
seeming
to
disarm
and
please
the
designing
woman
whose
familiarity
was
at
once
her
influence
and
her
weakness
and
she
lavished
her
sociable
nature
on
blacks
and
whites
samson
was
so
fearless
and
observing
that
he
betrayed
no
interest
in
escaping
and
came
slowly
into
the
range
of
her
temperament
but
as
hulda
peeped
towards
midnight
into
the
kitchen
she
saw
old
samson
kindly
patting
juba
while
patty
was
executing
a
drunken
dance
as
the
latter
dropped
upon
a
pallet
bed
she
had
there
and
fell
into
a
doze
the
colored
man
quietly
raised
the
latch
and
walked
off
the
tavern
porch
in
the
morning
dawn
horses
and
voices
were
heard
by
hulda
and
she
recognized
joe
johnson
steps
in
the
house
he
shook
patty
cannon
but
could
not
awaken
her
then
looked
into
van
dorn
room
and
found
hulda
apparently
sound
asleep
and
heard
his
name
called
by
allan
mclane
across
the
hall
joe
not
so
loud
be
conservative

i
waiting

made
a
single
capture
the
niggers
drove
him
out
of
dover
with
firearms
and
he
is
wounded
somewhere
the
tall
kidnapper
turned
pale
and
then
consigned
van
dorn
shade
to
eternal
torment
do
swear
before
me
sir
mclane
also
irritated
exclaimed
not
conservative
and
i
wo

it
black
dave
fired
the
barker
and
saw
him
settled
send
him
here
the
negro
came
in
and
hoarse
with
diseased
lungs
and
stood
the
wreck
of
a
once
gigantic
and
regular
man
gi
me
a
drink
he
muttered
i
mos
dead
wi
misery
an
cold
tell
this
man
what
you
did
joe
johnson
spoke
you
waited
till
you
saw
the
hat
at
the
window
and
fired
and
fetched
hat
an
man
to
the
ground
swallowing
a
thimbleful
of
mclane
brandy
the
negro
grunted
blood
and
looked
tremblingly
at
his
hands
what
shape
of
hat
was
it
mclane
asked
shaking
the
negro
savagely
was
it
like
this
shaping
his
own
soft
slouched
hat
to
a
point
black
dave
looked
and
shook
his
head
not
like
that
damnation
no
swearing
colonel
before
us
conservatives
ventured
joe
johnson
what
was
the
hat
like
dave
you
drunk
like
dis
i
reckon
he
modelled
the
crown
into
a
bell
form
with
his
finger
joe
johnson
and
mclane
looked
at
each
other
a
minute
with
mutual
accusation
and
confusion
and
the
former
unceremoniously
knocked
the
negro
down
with
his
great
fist
no
gold
of
mine
for
this
job
joe
johnson
said
allan
mclane
in
your
conservatism
to
save
your
own
skin
you
have
let
your
tool
kill
an
innocent
man
he
waved
his
hand
with
all
his
strong
will
towards
the
door
and
shut
it
in
the
kidnapper
face
then
in
haughty
emotion
not
like
fear
but
disappointed
pride
and
revenge
mclane
sat
down
glanced
around
him
as
if
to
determine
the
next
movement
and
instinctively
reached
his
hand
towards
his
bible
which
he
opened
at
a
marked
page
and
softly
read
till
tears
of
baffled
vindictiveness
and
counterfeited
humility
stopped
his
voice
as
follows
everything
there
is
a
season
and
a
time
to
every
purpose
under
the
heaven
a
time
to
be
born
and
a
time
to
die
a
time
to
plant
and
a
time
to
pluck
up
that
which
is
planted
a
time
to
kill
and
a
time
to
heal
a
time
to
break
down
and
a
time
to
build
up
god
requireth
that
which
is
past
man
hath
no
above
a
beast
for
all
is
vanity
a
man
should
rejoice
in
his
own
works
for
that
is
his
portion
for
who
shall
bring
him
to
see
what
shall
be
after
him
when
tears
of
pious
vindictiveness
had
closed
the
reading
colonel
mclane
spread
his
pongee
handkerchief
on
the
bare
floor
and
knelt
in
silent
and
comfortably
assured
prayer
black
dave
had
crawled
into
the
room
where
hulda
partly
heard
these
revelations
and
he
entered
the
large
closet
under
the
concealed
shaft
to
the
prison
pen
where
his
groans
and
mental
agony
touched
commiseration
she
opened
the
trap
and
crawled
there
too
hush
dave
she
whispered
what
makes
you
so
miserable
missy
killed
a
man
dey
made

hulda

i

stummick
unburnt
by

i
stood
in
no
man

at
de
church
dey
put

my
soul

happy
one
day
i
licked
a
man
bigger
dan
me
it
made
me
proud
an
sassy
i
backslid
an
wa
no

got
me
an
den
de
kidnappers
used
me
an
now
de
blood
of
cain
an
abel
is
on
my
forehead
forever
hulda
knelt
by
the
murderer
and
prayed
with
all
her
heart
not
the
special
pleading
of
the
prayer
across
the
hall
but
the
humble
prayer
of
the
penitent
on
calvary
lord
we
of
this
felon
den
ask
to
be
with
thee
in
paradise
the
whole
of
the
next
day
was
spent
in
preparations
for
flight
by
patty
and
her
a
boat
of
sufficient
size
and
crew
to
man
it
had
to
be
procured
down
the
river
and
this
necessitated
two
journeys
one
of
patty
to
ferry
another
by
joe
to
vienna
and
twiford
wharf
during
their
absence
cy
james
was
equally
intent
on
something
and
hulda
saw
him
in
the
ploughed
field
near
the
old
delaware
cottage
under
the
swooping
buzzards
directing
the
farmer
where
to
guide
his
plough
and
it
seemed
in
a
little
while
that
one
of
the
horses
had
fallen
into
a
pit
there
later
on
hulda
observed
cy
james
with
a
spade
digging
at
various
places
near
patty
cannon
former
cottage
all
are
at
work
for
themselves
hulda
thought
except
levin
and
me
how
often
have
i
seen
aunt
patty
slip
to
secret
places
in
the
night
or
by
early
dawn
when
she
looked
every
window
over
to
see
if
she
was
watched
her
beehives
were
her
greatest
care
a
sudden
thought
made
hulda
stand
still
and
cast
the
color
from
her
cheeks
they
are
all
going
away
i
shall
be
taken
too
or
kept
for
worse
evil
here
my
mother
in
florida
hates
me
she
has
told
me
so
i
know
the
marriage
allan
mclane
means
for
me
to
be
his
white
slave
levin
is
poor
and
his
mother
is
poor
too
they
say
patty
cannon
has
buried
gold
perhaps
god
will
point
it
out
to
me
she
slipped
down
the
seaford
road
and
walked
up
the
lane
in
the
fields
she
knew
so
well
no
person
was
in
the
cottage
hulda
went
among
the
outbuildings
and
began
to
inspect
the
beehives
made
of
sections
of
round
trees
and
the
big
wooden
patty
cannon
had
left
behind
her
she
was
only
interrupted
by
a
gun
being
fired
in
the
ploughed
field
and
saw
the
pertinacious
buzzards
there
fall
dead
from
the
air
as
they
exasperated
the
ploughman
i
shall
have
one
piece
of
fun
in
maryland
before
i
go
hulda
heard
her
stepfather
say
as
he
went
past
her
bed
to
ascend
the
hatchway
at
morn
and
that
is
to
burn
the
nigger
who
mugged
me
this
is
his
day
almost
immediately
he
came
cursing
down
the
ladder
followed
by
a
jeering
laugh
from
above
and
the
cry
we
all
see
you
hanged
yit
by
smoke
an
mash
another
egg
on
your
countenance
in
a
moment
or
two
a
tremendous
quarrel
was
going
on
below
stairs
between
the
kidnapper

pushing
past

between

his
countenance
had
begun
to
assume
a
sensual
expression
when
patty
cannon
to
whom
his
back
was
turned
rushed
upon
him
like
a
tornado
lifted
him
from
his
feet
and
threw
him
through
the
back
door
into
the
yard
and
bolted
him
out
mclane
retreated
by
the
other
door

me
by
taking
the

quadroon
therefore
i
want
to
deprive

do
you
see
his
face
expressed
the
indifference
he
felt
to

and
the
coarse
suggestion
gave
patty

her
opportunity

there
but

few
minutes
in
silence

said
patty
cannon
with
a
giggle
we
have
no
neighbors
that
air
not
used
to
noises
yer
the
silence
was
restored
while
the
two
products
of
read
each
other
countenances
i
made
a
very
conservative
and
liberal
proposition
to
her
patty
and
she
insulted
me
yet
beautifully
but
i
owe
her
a
grudge
for
it
insulted

little
remorse

the
old

familiarly

heard
something
of
about
your
origin
patty
i
do

no
more
about

a
pore
ignorant
gal
would

i
hearn
my
grandfather

a
lord
a
gypsy
woman

his
son
and
he

from
his
door
an
his
wife
fetched
him
on
her
money
to
canady
where
she
went
into
the
smugglin
business
at
john
between
montreal
and
the
united
states
and
he
was
hanged
there
for
assassinating
a
friend
who
detected
him
they
says

patty
cannon
and
what
a
career
you

led
aunt
patty

but
in
this
old
pocket
between
the
bays
you
would
have
had
the
reputation
of
captain
kidd
tell
me
now
conservatively
was
not
your
own
helpless
childhood
the
cause
of
your
mistakes
and
does
it
never
make
you
feel
for
other
like
hulda
the
woman
with
a
certain
like
one
reflected
upon
harshly
finally
clapped
her
bold
black
eyes
on
mclane
and
replied
chuckling
i
do
know
as

cunnil
before
my
mother

loved

full
of
pride
and
with
an
oath

he
hesitated
it
not

price
patty

way

it
cowardly
yes

patty
saucily
it
kidnappin
that
the
trade

cunnil
an
this
bare
room
will
brighten
to
be
your
wedding
chamber
pah
are
you
a
man
her
words
aroused
the
visions
can
reluctantly
repulse
and
which
entertained
but
an
instant
grow
irresistible
the
limber
maturing
rounding
form
of
hulda
stepped
on
the
footstool
of
his
mind
touched
his
knee
and
exhaled
the
aroma
of
her
youth
like
a
subtile
musk
till
he
leaned
back
languidly
as
if
he
smoked
a
pipe
and
on
its
bowl
her
bust
was
painted
and
all
her
modesties
dissolved
into
the
intoxication
brutality
itself
grew
natural
to
this
vision
as
a
fiercer
joy
and
substitute
for
the
deceit
he
could
no
longer
practice
the
child
had
flown
from
her
in
the
instant
of
his
grasping
it
like
a
pale
butterfly
but
there
remained
where
it
had
floated
a
silken
and
nubile
essence
fairy
and
humanity
in
one
clad
in
pure
thoughts
and
sweet
respect
the
profanation
of
which
would
be
as
rare
a
game
as
satan
struggle
with
the
soul
of
eve
her
innocence
and
spirit
and
awakened
womanly
consciousness
weakness
and
sensibility
mettle
and
beauty
presented
themselves
by
turns
and
the
cold
woodeny
room
the
neglected
tavern
the
autumn
night
wind
coming
down
the
chimney
and
starting
the
fire
all
seemed
instinctive
like
him
with
mischief
as
if
patty
cannon
soul
flew
astraddle
of
a
broom
and
led
a
hundred
witches
mclane
was
fifty
his
family
was
a
stiff
commercial
one
that
had
generally
kept
demure
yet
grasping
and
practised
the
conservatism
he
also
boasted
of
but
had
departed
from
he
was
the
outlaw
of
the
house
yet
elevating
its
tenets
into
an
aggressive
shibboleth
the
more
so
that
he
prospered
by
he
was
a
backer
of
domestic
and
put
his
money
into
forms
of
gain
men
hesitated
at
not
only
at
the
curbstone
for
usury
but
behind
pawnbrokers
and
sporting
men
in
lottery
companies
and
and
it
was
said
in
the
open
too
clippers
for
which
occasionally
stole
out
of
the
chesapeake
on
affected
trading
errands
to
the
east
indies
and
came
home
with
nothing
but
west
india
fruits
he
strove
to
maintain
his
credit
by
ostentatious
abhorrence
of
novelties
and
heterodoxies
and
of
all
liberal
agitations
and
had
the
sublime
hardihood
to
carry
his
bible
into
every
sink
of
shame
as
if
it
was
the
natural
baggage
of
a
gentleman
and
expected
with
him
and
he
would
rebuke
blasphemy
while
bidding
at
the
slave
auction
or
sitting
in
a
full
of
kidnappers
among
many
of
whom
he
passed
for
a
religious
standard
no
portion
of
that
bible
gave
him
any
delight
or
occupation
however
except
the
old
testament
with
its
thoroughgoing
codes
of
servitude
concubinage
and
he
knew
the
jewish
laws
better
than
the
scribes
and
pharisees
in
the
time
of
herod
and
john
and
had
persuaded
himself
that
the
mental
endorsement
and
wherever
possible
the
practice
of
these
constituted
a
firm
believer
revenge
intolerance
formality
and
had
become
so
much
his
theory
that
he
did
not
know
himself
whether
he
was
capable
of
doing
evil
provided
he
wanted
anything
not
particularly
courageous
he
was
so
destitute
of
sensibility
that
he
felt
no
fear
anywhere
and
generally
going
among
his
low
white
inferiors
he
was
in
the
habit
of
being
looked
up
to
and
rather
preferred
their
society
on
everything
he
had
an
opinion
and
permitted
no
stranger
in
baltimore
to
entertain
any
the
riot
spirit
so
early
and
so
frequent
in
that
town
reposed
upon
such
vulturous
and
social
pests
as
he
ever
claiming
to
be
the
public
tone
of
maryland
patty
said
allan
mclane
in
his
and
bland
yet
hard
voice
like
mush
eaten
with
a
i
may
pay
you
this
money
and
you
may
fail
to
deliver
the
property
will
she
be
tractable
cunnil
i
scare
her
most
to
death
she
hide
from
me
yer
by
your
fire
and
my
voice
outside
the
door
will
keep
her
in
yer
till
day
mclane
went
to
his
portmanteau
and
unlocked
it
and
took
out
rolls
of
notes
and
a
buckskin
bag
of
gold
the
yellow
lustre
seemed
to
flash
in
patty
cannon
rich
black
eyes
like
the
moon
overhead
upon
a
well
how
beautiful
it
do
shine
cunnil
she
said
nothing
is
like
it
fur
a
friend
youth
an
beauty
has
to
go
together
to
be
strong
but
by
god
gold
kin
go
it
alone
he
counted
out
two
piles
one
of
notes
and
one
of
gold
using
his
gold
spectacles
upon
his
hawk
nose
to
do
so
and
said
patty
i
bought
many
a
grandchild
the
old
woman
but
this
is
the
first
child
i
have
bought
the
grandmother
now
fulfil
your
contract
and
earn
your
money
he
put
his
spectacles
in
his
pocket
stretched
his
gaitered
slippers
before
the
fire
looked
at
his
watch
and
let
the
crystal
seal
drop
on
his
sleek
abdomen
and
his
vitreous
eyes
filled
with
color
like
twin
vases
in
a
druggist
window
he
was
ready
and
anxious
to
substitute
the
ruffian
for
the
tempter
patty
cannon
glancing
at
the
money
on
the
table
and
bearing
a
lamp
started
at
once
through
the
house
calling
huldy
huldy
nothing
responded
to
the
name
she
searched
from
room
to
room
peering
everywhere
and
made
the
circuit
twice
and
taking
a
lantern
went
into
the
windy
night
and
round
the
bounds
of
the
old
tavern
the
house
was
easily
explored
having
no
cellar
nor
outbuildings
and
the
trap
to
the
was
locked
fast
the
girl
shawl
and
hat
were
also
gone
she
heard
us
i
reckon
the
old
woman
muttered
she
run
away
ruined
me
joe
cruel
to
me
van
dorn
is
gone
without
gold
i
go
to
the
mclane
is
pitiless
she
dwelt
upon
the
sentence
and
with
only
an
instant
hesitation
turned
into
the
tavern
again
and
buttoned
the
outer
door
beneath
her
feather
bed
she
reached
her
hand
and
drew
out
a
large
object
took
a
horn
from
the
mantel
and
sprinkled
it
with
something
contained
there
and
then
in
a
bold
masculine
walk
stamping
hard
went
in
the
dark
up
the
open
stairs
again
talking
as
she
advanced
loudly
complaisantly
or
sternly
as
if
to
some
truant
she
was
coaxing
or
forcing
finally
at
mclane
chamber
she
knocked
hard
crying
open
cunnil
here
the
bashful
creatur
she
dare
disobey
no
mo
step
out
and
kiss
her
cunnil
ha
said
mclane
throwing
open
his
door
out
of
which
the
full
light
of
fire
and
candles
gleamed
conservative
is
she
well
let
her
enter
as
he
made
one
step
to
penetrate
the
darkness
with
his
dazzled
eyes
patty
cannon
silently
thrust
against
his
heart
a
huge
and
pulled
the
trigger
a
flash
of
fire
from
the
sharp
flint
against
the
fresh
powder
in
the
pan
lit
up
the
hall
an
instant
and
the
heavy
body
of
the
guest
fell
backward
before
his
chair
and
over
him
leaned
the
woman
a
moment
still
as
death
with
the
heavy
pistol
clubbed
ready
to
strike
if
he
should
stir
he
did
not
move
but
only
bled
at
the
large
lips
ghastly
and
unprotesting
and
the
cold
blue
eyes
looked
as
natural
as
life
patty
cannon
took
the
chair
and
counted
the
money
chapter
xlii
beaks
the
wind
was
blowing
in
spells
like
crowds
moved
during
an
argument
at
one
time
mute
as
awe
again
murmurous
and
sometimes
mutinous
and
fierce
when
hulda
having
heard
a
few
words
only
of
her
overture
glided
from
the
old
tavern
and
passed
on
into
the
night
terrified
but
not
unthinking
till
she
reached
some
large
pines
that
seemed
to
say
over
her
head
high
up
towards
heaven
where
now
oh
where
in
the
of
the
anywhere
answered
hulda
not
afraid
of
cold
or
nature
so
intense
had
become
her
fear
of
men
and
women
still
where
i
might
go
to
ferry
and
tell
my
tale
to
those
merchants
or
to
seaford
and
beg
a
shelter
somewhere
there
but
first
i
will
try
our
old
cottage
home
again
she
went
so
quietly
up
the
field
lane
that
dogs
could
not
have
heard
her
and
as
she
approached
the
little
house
saw
lights
in
it
and
soon
heard
voices
and
saw
moving
figures
within
knowing
every
and
crack
of
the
little
dwelling
hulda
soon
had
a
perfect
view
of
the
contents
of
the
house
by
standing
in
the
dark
a
little
distance
from
one
of
the
low
small
windows
a
table
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
main
room
on
which
was
an
old
mouldered
chest
with
the
earth
clinging
to
it
and
beside
the
chest
were
bones
and
shreds
of
clothing
on
the
riven
lid
of
the
chest
you
swear
that
the
evidence
you
give
shall
be
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
so
help
you
god
exclaimed
a
small
chunky
person
presenting
a
book
to
be
kissed
by
a
scrawny
chinless
lad
whom
hulda
immediately
recognized
as
cyrus
james

i
take

looked
at
cy

as
if
he
had
a
mind
to
bite
his
nose
off
as
a
mere
beginning

entered
and
looked
in
room
she
was
not
there
a
slight
smell
of
gunpowder
seemed
to
be
in
the
hall
passing
rapidly
up
the
stairs
johnson
saw
a
light
shine
in
mclane
room

he
kicked

there
she
pointed
to
a
lying
upon
the
floor
the
outlines
of
which
seemed
unusually
pointed
and
stiff
for
feathers
though
it
was
sown
up
in
its
own
blankets
and
quilts
joe
johnson
touched
it
with
his
foot
and
bounded
back

joe
johnson

became
almost
livid
pale
and
rushing
upon

cannon
with

raised

struck
her
to
the
floor

put
his
boot

he
rushed
away
and
gave
a
low
whistle
at
the
window
daw
and
brother
ebenezer
a
lower
set
and
more
sinister
being
bounded
up
the
stairs
and
loosened
and
drove
before

the

band
of
captives
one
word
from
you
white
nigger

this

scatters
your
brains
in

joe
johnson
drew
a
pistol
as
he
spoke
and
jimmy
phoebus
saw
his
nervous
determination
too
clearly
to
provoke
it
now
put
this
dab
upon
the
wagon
johnson
said
referring
to
the
bed
and
it
was
carried
down
by
the
brothers
and
the
dead
man
portmanteau
thrown
in
beside

voice
of

from

hulk
lush
with

i
give
it
to
you
he
was
gone
in
the
vague
dawn
she
fell
upon
her
face
across
the
little
bar
and
moaned
a
pore
pore
pore
old
woman
how
long
she
had
been
leaning
there
she
did
not
know
till
familiar
sounds
fell
on
her
ears
and
looking
up
with
a
cry
of
recognition
she
shouted
van
dorn
god
bless
you
van
dorn
is
you
alive
again
the
captain
was
supported
in
the
arms
of
another
person
who
took
him
ghastly
pale
into
the
little
bar
and
laid
him
upon
her
pallet
muttering
i
loved
him
as
i
never
loved
a
male
the
morning
was
well
advanced
and
the
sun
made
the
gaunt
and
steep
old
tavern
rise
like
a
mammoth
from
the
level
lands
and
filled
its
upper
front
rooms
with
golden
wine
of
light
as
patty
cannon
sat
in
one
of
them
by
a
window
near
the
piazza
and
talked
to
van
dorn
whom
she
had
tenderly
washed
and
and
placed
him
in
her
own
comfortable
of
rushes
with
his
feet
raised
as
all
unaffected
americans
like
and
blanketed
upon
a
second
chair
her
woes
and
his
relief
made
patty
social
yet
tender
and
the
instincts
of
her
sex
had
returned
to
be
petted
and
beloved
oh
captain
she
said
fondly
how
clean
and
sweet
you
look
like
my
good
man
again
do
be
cross
to
me
van
dorn
my
heart
is
sad
patty
fie
sad
i
like
to
see
you
saucy
and
defiant
let
us
not
repent
so
joe
has
left
you
with
cruel
curses
my
daughter
hates
me
he
says
and
means
to
be
a
lady
where
i
ca

child

hard
even
if
i
have
been
bad
there
nothing
left
me
now
but
you
van
dorn
oh
do
not
die
he
coughed
carefully
as
if
coughing
was
a
luxury
to
be
very
mildly
exerted
and
wiped
a
little
blood
from
his
tongue
and
lip
i
try
not
to
die
till
i
comfort
you
some
the
ball
is
at
my
windpipe
and
when
the
blood
trickles
in
it
makes
me
cough
and
i
must
beware
of
emotions
the
surgeon
says
lest
it
drop
into
my
lung
and
break
a
by
some
very
spasmodic
cough
so
do
not
be
too
beautiful
or
i
might
perish
he
stroked
his
long
yellow
mustache
with
the
hand
and
drew
his
velvet
tight
upon
his
silken
curls
but
he
was
too
pale
to
blush
as
formerly
though
he
lisped
as
much
like
a
modest
boy
captain
the
woman
said
pleased
to
crimson
you
are
so
much
smarter
than
me
i
afeard
of
you

little
yet

my
life

first
we
met
a
little
captain
tell
it
to
me
again
praise
me
if
you
kin
almost
desolate
her
lip
trembled
and
she
glanced
at
the
fields
across
the
way
she
had
so
long
inhabited
where
as
it
seemed
to
her
more
life
than
ever
was
visible
though
she
did
not
look
carefully
how
many
years
it
has
been
patty
we
will
not
tell
i
was
coming
home
from
africa
with
an
emigrant
a
briton
my
capturer
indeed
that
officer
in
the
blockading
squadron
on
that
coast
who
seized
my
privateer
the
with
all
her
complement
of
guinea
slaves
his
name
was
all
i
took
from
him
you
got
the
rest
she
stole
a
startled
look
at
him
out
of
her
listening
eyes
as
if
this
might
be
unpleasant
talk
but
he
parried
it
with
a
compliment
dios
what
a
family
of
beauties
you
were
betty
with
her
hoyden
air
and
jane
with
her
wealth
of
charms
and
patty
with
her
bold
rich
eyes
and
conquering
will
we
sailed
into
the
nanticoke
by
mistake
for
the
manokin
my
friend
had
pitied
my
misfortunes
and
liked
my
company
and
when
he
broke
me
up
as
a
slaver
having
already
been
broken
as
a
privateer
had
said
that
country
you
praise
so
well
has
infatuated
me
i
resign
my
commission
and
buy
a
little
vessel
and
settle
in
america
with
you
for
the
sake
of
my
dear
little
daughter
hulda
van
dorn
that
poor
little
where
did
she
spend
the
chill
night
yesterday
patty
can
you
tell
he
coughed
again
very
carefully
and
his
eye
the
brighter
for
his
fretted
lungs
never
left
his
hostess
as
though
he
feared
she
might
overlook
some
pleasing
feature
of
his
story
she
trotted
her
foot
and
muttered
you
made
me
jealous
of
her
i
got
to
hate
an
fear
her
lovey
voluptuous
as
two
young
widowers
were
after
a
long
cruise
we
tarried
among
you
sirens
myself
almost
at
the
threshold
of
my
home
where
my
wife
believed
me
dead
yet
waited
longingly
and
waits
this
morn
dear
patty
da

my
friend

with
bright
betty

remorse
at
the
spectacle
of
his
little
child
so
and
beckoned
me
away
but
he
had
shown
his
gold
and
could
better
be
spared
than
reckless
i
you
know
the
cool
deep
game
dear
pat
ha
i
was
made
to
buy
the
poison

seem
the
accomplice

his
death

week

crack
ran
through
the
empty
wooden
house

made
her
rise
van

as
he
was
called

her
uneasiness
like
a
pallid
mask
painted
with
a
smile

russet

how

with

than
her
recitation

he
coughed
painfully
still
watching
her
however
and
answered
only
a
i
guess

pat
what
are
you
at
your
time
of
life
no
cried
patty
cannon
defiantly

something
from

bosom
here

the
same
dose
i
gave
my
husband
if
the
worst
comes
bravo
patty
you
only
tarnish
into
age
like
an
old
bronze
that
is
harder
by
time
and
oxidizing
i
was
a
gentleman
and
yet
you
mastered
me
how
strange
to
see
us
together
beleaguered
here
myself
by
death
and
you
by
the
law
why
we
have
defied
them
both
let
them
come
on
do
you
believe
in
everlasting
fire
that
every
injury
is
a
live
coal
to
roast
the
soul
i
know
you
do
and
if
you
do
how
beautiful
your
rosy
grate
will
be
tough
charmer
with
boys
spoiled
in
the
bud
and
husbands
in
the
blossom
with
families
of
freemen
torn
apart
and
children
born
free
as
the
flag
of
their
country
sent
to
perpetual
bondage
and

sold
them

by

who
gave

news
at
dover
and
beat
us
back
he
had
partly
risen
as
he
spoke
and
the
exertion
seemed
to
choke
him
the
woman
sat
in
dreadful
silence
watching
his
veins
rise
upon
his
pale
and
wilful
face
he
caught
at
his
throat
with
his
fingers
and
for
a
time
could
speak
no
more
patty
said
he
at
last
between
his
coughing
spells

hala

he
pointed
his
white
finger
at
her
in
an
ecstasy
with
a
mocking
smile
in
his
blue
eyes
like
fading
stars
at
dawn
and
then
the
rosy
morning
flowed
all
round
his
mouth
as
the
bullet
detached
in
his
emotion
fell
towards
the
lung
and
wakened
hemorrhage
and
to
the
last
of
his
strength
he
pointed
at
her
and
then
fell
back
in
crimson
linen
smiling
yet
in
death
terrified
at
the
unwonted
scene
of
a
natural
decease
in
that
abode
of
violence
the
mistress
only
sat
the
image
of
paralysis
till
her
door
slowly
opened
and
there
entered
hand
in
hand
young
levin
dennis
and
hulda
van
dorn
levin
the
young
girl
said
composed
as
one
to
whom
reputable
life
and
obsequies
were
familiar
i
have
heard
the
dying
sentences
of
this
misled
strong
disappointed
man
let
us
kneel
down
dear
friend
and
say
a
prayer
he
was
our
father
levin
not
van
dorn
is
my
name
the
daughter
of
his
friend
but
captain
oden
dennis
of
the
privateer
as
they
knelt
with
closed
eyes
the
room
slowly
filled
and
patty
cannon
arms
were
seized
by
two
constables
and
the
warrant
read
to
her
she
heard
it
with
humility
making
no
answer
but
this
once
i
had
money
an
friends
a
plenty
my
money
is
gone
and
so
is

chapter

the
death
of
patty
cannon
as
patty
cannon
came
out
of
the
tavern
the
were
full
of
people
taking
their
last
look
at
the
spot
where
she
had
triumphed
for
nearly
twenty
years
none
thought
to
look
at
van
dorn
nor
ask
what
had
become
of
him
and
his
friend
sorden
removed
his
body
unseen
to
a
spot
in
the
pine
woods
where
his
unmarked
grave
was
dug
and
standing
round
it
were
three
mourners
only
and
sorden
said
the
final
words
with
homely
tears
i
loved
him
as
i
never
loved
a
male
the
maryland
constable
marched
patty
cannon
down
to
the
little
bridge
of
planks
where
ran
the
ditch
nearly
on
the
state
line
and
tradition
still
believes
the
figment
that
joe
johnson
at
that
moment
was
hiding
beneath
it
there
driven
across
the
boundary
like
some
borderer
cow
the
queen
of
the
kidnappers
was
seized
by
the
delaware
constable
and
placed
in
a
small
country
and
followed
by
a
large
mounted
posse
the
road
was
taken
to
the
little
hamlet
of
seaford
five
miles
distant
she
watched
the
small
funereal
cedars
and
monumental
rise
strangled
from
the
underbrush
the
streams
flowing
into
inky
the
close
small
pines
scarcely
large
enough
to
moan
but
trying
to
do
so
in
a
baby
tone
and
her
eyes
turned
to
the
sand
where
she
was
soon
to
be
not
agony
nor
repentance
nor
any
hope
of
escape
fluttered
her
cold
heart
but
only
a
feeling
of
being
ungratefully
deserted
by
her
friends
and
by
her
equals
and
neighbors
who
had
so
seldom
warned
or
avoided
her
no
preacher
had
come
to
tell
her
the
naked
gospel
and
some
had
bowed
to
her
respectfully
and
even
begged
her
oats
and
made
subscriptions
from
her
silver
seaford
was
a
sandy
place
upon
a
bluff
of
the
nanticoke
and
as
the
procession
came
in
a
party
of
surveyors
working
for
meshach
railroad
paused
to
jeer
the
old
kidnapper
she
had
grown
suddenly
old
and
never
raised
her
voice
that
had
always
been
so
forward
to
make
a
reply
the
magistrate
john
gibbons
had
been
an
educated
young
irishman
who
landed
from
a
ship
at
lewes
and
marrying
a
lady
in
maryland
near
patty
cannon
became
the
legal
spirit
of
the
little
town
his
office
a
mere
cabin
on
a
corner
by
his
house
being
too
small
for
the
purpose
the
examination
was
adjourned
to
the
tavern
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
near
where
a
brook
dug
its
way
to
the
nanticoke
around
the
tavern
some
walks
were
made
in
the
sand
and
bordered
the
cold
and
at
pauses
in
the
hearing
were
heard
to
play
and
pipe
in
the
falling
tide
the
evidence
of
cy
james
and
other
cowardly
companions
in
her
sins
was
quickly
given
and
the
procession
started
through
the
woods
and
sands
to
georgetown
twelve
miles
to
the
eastward
where
patty
cannon
was
received
by
all
the
town
waiting
up
for
her
and
the
jail
immediately
closed
her
in
i
did
ezackly
make
out
what
that
feller
did
it
fur
jimmy
phoebus
remarked
in
the
hold
of
an
old
oyster
pungy
where
he
found
himself
with
his
mulatto
friend
and
aunt
hominy
and
the
children

remarked

the
docile
colored

exclaimed
the
sailor

its
stiff
invisible
contents

joe
sell

fur
a
nigger
phoebus
power
over
his
little
children
and
idiotic
hominy
included
was
now
perfect
and
he
began
to
explore
the
rotten
old
hold
which
contained
and
the
usual
utensils
of
a
and
soon
discovered
that
there
could
be
made
a
clear
passage
to
crawl
through
her
from
forecastle
by
removing
a
few
boards
yer
hominy
he
said

work
with
your
needle
old
gal
goin
to
take
you
home
with
a
good
start
and
a
fair

and
slack

johnson
was
off

at
eight

mile
to
go
an

work
his
passage
he
walked
to
the
hatchway
over
the
hold
and
sliding
it
back
dropped
in
and
with
a
few
expert
blows
of
the
professional
smithy
set
whatcoat
free
merely
glancing
where
phoebus
lay
upon
his
face
snoring
hard
cool
cucumber
of
a
bloke
johnson
said
he
be
too
much
fur
me
in
a
trade
i
have
to
stifle
him
then
ordering
the
mulatto
man
astern
johnson
gave
him
the
tiller
and
sat
near
nodding
till
the
second
wharf
on
the
starboard
was
passed
now
gabriel
ca
overhaul
me
johnson
exclaimed
thar
no

dorchester
side
an
the
somerset
roads

all
gashed
by
creeks
an
barred
by
i
sink
that
dab
an
stiffy
he
called
two
deck
hands
and
lifted
the
body
out
of
the
hold
phoebus
still
placidly
slept
upon
his
face
and
johnson
looked
at
him
with
peculiar
envy
after
a
hurried
glance
at
the
dead
some
ropes
being
put
around
the
bed
and
attached
to
them
the
whole
weight
was
unceremoniously
thrown
overboard
at
the
point
of
hungry
neck
and
the
dealer
remarked
apologetically
there
goes
a
great
hypocrite
gentlemen
he
was
above
piracy
ef
he
could
git
another
man
to
fly
the
black
flag
for
him
i

after
this
and
now
i
snooze

broad
inlet
all
the
way
an
remember
nigger
i
sleep
and
shoot

hair
triggers
with
his
pistols
in
his
hand
johnson
lay
down
in
the
cabin
a
few
feet
from
the
helmsman
and
tried
to
see
and
sleep
at
once
he
had
been
without
rest
for
many
nights
and
sleep
soon
bound
him
in
its
own
clevis
and
manacles
when
he
awoke
so
deep
had
been
his
slumber
that
he
could
not
recall
for
a
moment
where
he
was
the
tiller
was
unmanned
the
stars
shone
in
the
cabin
hatchway
a
cold
draft
blew
through
the
old
hulk
and
as
he
dragged
himself
up
the
steps
he
saw
tall
woods
near
by
and
heard
the
voice
of
solemn
pines
the
vessel
was
aground
wild
geese
were
making
jubilant
shrieks
as
they
cut
the
water
with
their
fleecy
wings
like
cameo
engraving
the
outlaw
gazed
and
gazed
and
finally
muttered
deil
island
or
i
a
billy
noodle
i
run
from
it
the
last
time
i
was
yer
an
my
blood
runs
cold
to
be
yer
agin
my
daddy
got
his
curse
from
this
taking
speed
from
his
apprehensions
johnson
slid
back
the
hatchway
and
leaped
into
the
hold
starlight
and
moonlight
following
him
and
nothing
did
they
reveal
there
except
one
man
peacefully
sleeping
upon
his
face
as
phoebus
had
last
been
seen
the
kidnapper
shook
his
captive
but
he
did
not
awaken
he
turned
the
man
over
and
there
met
his
eyes
the
cold
blue
stare
and
roman
nose
and
bleeding
lips
of
allan
mclane
apparently
returned
from
the
bottom
of
the
river
with
a
shriek
the
outlaw
bounded
upon
the
deck
and
ran
to
the
bow
of
the
pungy
help
me
came
a
faint
cry
from
the
forecastle
and
peeping
in
joe
johnson
recognized
one
of
his
own
familiars
he
had
shipped
at
ferry
gagged
like
his
companion
and
tied
fast

ancient
edifice
of
hard
pine
where
the
worship
of
her
english
race
had
long
been
celebrated
the
naval
officer

became
the

by
her
affability
and
sorrow
had
easy
times
in

but
as
the
examination
proceeded
before
the
grand
jury
and
her
menials
hastened
to
throw
their
responsibility
in
so
many
crimes
upon
her
alone
an
outer
opinion
demanded
that
she
be
treated
more
harshly
and
some
of
the
irons
she
had
manacled
upon
her
captives
were
riveted
upon
her
own
ankles
very
soon
dropsy
began
to
appear
in
her
legs
and
feet
and
after
it
became
evident
to
her
that
neither
money
nor
friends
were
forthcoming
in
her
defence
she
fell
into
a
passive
despair
the
frequent
conferences
between
jimmy
phoebus
and
cy
james
led
to
the
belief
that
not
only
had
hulda
recovered
portions
of
her
father
money
and
valuables
hidden
in
the
beehives
and
old
patty
had
so
assiduously
attended
but
that
phoebus
had
seized
upon
property
indicated
by
the
informer
and
was
to
have
whatever
remained
of
it
after
procuring
the
latter
release
this
result
was
hastened
by
patty
cannon
death
which
happened
to
the
great
relief
of
many
respectably
considered
people
in
that
region
who
had
feared
from
the
first
that
she
would
make
a
minute
confession
implicating
everybody
who
had
dealt
with
her
band
among
these
was
judge
custis
who
opened
his
to
john
clayton
one
day
clayton
had
quietly
prodded
on
the
conviction
of
patty
cannon
but
the
jealousy
of
the
slaveholding
interest
made
him
wary
of
any
open
appearance
against
her
they
were
sitting
in
the
little
parlor
of
the
methodist
parsonage
a
small
frame
house
with
a
portico
and
big
a
little
off
from
the
public
square
whither
they
had
gone
to
send
the
pastor
to
wait
on
the
aged
chancellor
who
had
been
taken
ill
in
the
and
lay
in
the
hotel
clayton
said
judge
custis
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
what
this
woman
may
do
or
tell
you
would
not
think
concerned
me
but
i
will
show
you
how
deep
her
influence
has
reached
as
well
as
explain
to
you
why
i
would
not
pursue
my
own
servants
to
her
den
in
this
i
humiliate
myself
before
you
as
i
must
do
if
i
am
to
become
your
client
you
had
been
trading
with
patty
cannon
i
guessed
that
much
such
was
the
case
when
i
was
a
collegian
at
yale
returning
home
one
holiday
i
fell
in
love
with
a
beautiful
quadroon
the
property
of
my
uncle
in
northampton
county
she
was
an
elegant
woman
with
a
good
education
and
had
been
my
playmate
i
was
ardent
and
and
easily
found
lodgment
in
her
heart
but
the
conquest
of
her
charms
was
long
and
agonizing
with
sincere
esteem
you
must
believe
me
when
i
declare
that
i
fell
dangerously
ill
because
i
was
refused
by
her
and
making
a
confidant
of
my
doctor
he
told
the
girl
that
she
must
choose
between
my
death
and
her
surrender
pity
then
prevailed
even
over
religion
i
was
happy
in
every
point
but
one
the
injury
concealment
worked
upon
her
for
clayton
my
mistress
was
my
own
cousin
goy
i
never
desired
to
marry
although
no
children
had
been
born
in
my
patriarchal
relation
but
in
the
course
of
years
my
uncle
became
pressed
for
debts
and
he
appealed
to
me
to
save
my
beautiful
handmaiden
from
sale
he
being
in
full
sympathy
with
my
relation
to
her
because
she
was
his
daughter
i
goy
the
case
was
urgent
i
possessed
some
negroes
the
legacy
of
my
mother
to
sell
them
publicly
would
be
a
stigma
both
upon
my
humanity
and
my
credit
i
adopted
the
cowardly
device
of
letting
a
kidnapper
slip
them
away
and
take
a
large
commission
for
his
trouble
i
saved
my
lady
but
at
the
expense
of
a
secret
and
that
secret
joe
johnson
depended
on
custis
when
he
was
suddenly
driven
into
your
house
and
found
your
old
servant
already
demoralized
by
the
announcement
of
your
the
scoundrel
pressed
his
advantage
and
he
saw
besides
my
daughter
not
vesta
but
her
virgie
and
between
his
persecution
of
her
and
my
vindictiveness
poor
virgie
was
literally
run
to
the
ground
and
into
it
she
is
in
her
grave
judge
custis
broke
into
a
long
fit
of
sobbing
and
clayton
who
had
noticed
his
dejected
mien
since
their
separation
passed
an
arm
around
him
saying
never
mind
now
never
mind
old
friend
johnson
is
fled
mclane
they
whisper
has
never
been
seen
since
he
entered
johnson
tavern
his
will
was
found
there
and
your
daughter
gets
her
mother
property
and
servants
back
i
must
finish
my
story
judge
custis
said
stanching
his
tears
by
the
decline
of
every
family
with
natural
feelings
and
refinement
under
what
pinkney
termed
contaminating
curse
of
reluctant
bondsmen
we
also
became
poor
to
save
others
it
was
necessary
that
i
must
marry
and
get
money
by
my
own
prostitution
my
god
how
we
are
repaid
a
bride
was
found
for
me
in
baltimore
the
sister
of
allan
mclane
and
a
beauty
i
began
my
married
life
with
the
best
intentions
my
poor
mistress
herself
advised
me
to
turn
to
my
wife
and
become
a
true
man
she
told
me
so
with
her
heart
breaking
in
heaven
where
she
dwells
with
my
poor
child
she
hears
me
now
and
knows
i
speak
the
truth
judge
custis
broke
down
again
and
leaned
his
convulsed
head
on
clayton
tender
breast
whose
own
widower
grief
gushed
forth
responsively
children
were
born
in
teackle
hall
my
servitude
was
becoming
adjusted
to
me
when
allan
mclane
in
his
love
of
vindictiveness
and
of
low
formal
respectability
conceived
that
my
poor
quadroon
required
some
chastisement
for
having
been
his
sister
rival
and
he
set
a
trap
to
buy
her
i
was
forced
to
have
her
bought
to
protect
her
and
to
bring
her
to
my
care
again
and
thus
our
passion
was
revived
and
giving
birth
to
virgie
she
died
reared
together
and
unconscious
of
their
kindred
those
daughters
loved
each
other
as
dearly
as
when
in
heaven
they
shall
hide
in
the
radiance
of
each
other
and
cover
my
sins
with
their
angelic
wings
rise
up
old
friend
cried
clayton
your
transgressions
are
at
least
washed
out
in
sincere
tears
hear
the
birds
all
around
us
loving
and
condoning
and
filling
the
air
with
praise
come
out
as
they
stepped
upon
georgetown
square
they
saw
john
randel
leading
a
party
of
surveyors
to
locate
the
opposition
railroad
to
meshach
milburn
these
and
many
others
were
pressing
towards
the
and
pillory
in
the
rear
of
the
where
stood
exposed
by
the
sheriff
the
cleanly
mulatto
woman
who
had
entertained
virgie
in
snow
hill
the
first
night
of
her
flight
this
free
woman
priscilla
hudson
cried
the
sheriff
is
to
stand
one
hour
in
the
pillory
for
the
crime
of
lending
her
pass
to
a
slave
thirty
lashes
she
was
sentenced
to
the
governor
has
graciously
taken
off
she
is
to
be
sold
out
of
the
state
at
the
end
of
one
hour
for
the
term
of
her
natural
life
to
the
highest
bidder
the
poor
woman
stood
there
bare
armed
and
bare
almost
to
the
bosom
delicate
and
lovely
to
see
and
the
mother
of
free
children
her
clothing
having
been
partly
removed
before
the
pardon
of
the
stripes
was
announced
to
her
her
head
and
arms
were
thrust
through
the
holes
in
one
leaf
of
the
pillory
and
thus
thrown
forward
her
modesty
was
exposed
to
the
wanton
gaze
of
the
crowd
while
on
the
other
side
of
the
same
elevated
platform
pilloried
in
like
manner
was
a
female
impudent
indifferent
and
chewing
tobacco
and
spitting
it
out
upon
the
pillory
floor
as
clayton
and
custis
saw
this
scene
on
their
way
to
the
tavern
an
egg
thrown
from
a
window
of
the
debtor
jail
whether
meant
for
hudson
or
not
struck
her
in
the
face
and
its
corrupt
contents
streamed
down
her
white
and
shivering
breast
shame
shame
cried
the
people
as
they
saw
the
woman
cry
and
gazing
up
to
the
jail
window
another
female
face
appearing
there
turned
their
cries
to
curses
hang
her
hang
her
for
the
last
time
in
life
patty
cannon
bold
and
comely
face
swelled
again
with
passionate
blood
to
the
roots
of
the
glossy
black
hair
and
the
few
who
saw
her
rich
dark
eyes
inflamed
with
anger
say
their
pupils
were
dilated
like
the
she
was
gone
in
a
moment
and
the
sheriff
had
wiped
hudson
face
and
breast
with
a
handkerchief
passed
up
by
a
colored
woman
two
men
were
now
actively
going
around
the
crowd
hat
in
hand
soliciting
contributions
to
buy
the
woman
the
first
a
blind
man
whose
eyes
were
bandaged
and
a
white
man
led
him
calling
loudly

abolitionists

raised
three
hundred
dollars
to
buy
this
freedom

hundred
more
as
some
mean
people
may
bid
her
up
high
this
man
her
husband
stole
her
pass
to
slip
a
friend
away
we
could
git
the
evidence
in
but
it
god

woman
nursed
my
wife
an
done
a
heap
of
good
and
she
come
here
of
her
own
free
will
out
of
maryland
to
nurse
the
chancellor
little
money
was
raised
in
that
crowd
since
there
was
little
to
give
and
addressing
the
two
distinguished
strangers
sorden
the
crier
exclaimed
what
gentlemen
will
you
let
the
hunn
brothers
and
tommy
garrett
and
the
motts
give
three
hundred
dollars
for
a
woman

and
we
who
see
her
always
doing
good
give
nothing
pity
pity
sobbed
the
blind
man
i
burned
so
bad
nobody
will
buy
but
i
stole
her
pass
to
help
a
slave
off
that
i
fell
in
love
with
judge
custis
left
clayton
side
and
waited
till
the
hour
in
the
pillory
was
done
and
after
a
fierce
contest
saw
sorden
come
off
victorious
at
the
sale
though
it
took
every
dollar
the
judge
could
raise
in
georgetown
on
his
private
credit
what
is
the
name
of
the
girl
you
gave
her
pass
to
asked
the
judge
of
the
blind
mulatto
virgie
marster
my
heart
told
me
so
exclaimed
the
judge
your
crime
has
been
punished
enough
i
will
send
you
to
your
wife
john
randel
observed
that
evening
devil
jim
clark
has
taken
example
from
patty
cannon
and
squared
the
circle
not
dead
asked
clayton
yes
dead
and
buried
he
was
cleaning
up
his
contract
on
the
canal
and
mistook
the
white
irish
laborers
there
for
kidnapped
niggers
they
set
on
him
and
beat
him
and
scared
him
together
so
that
he
never
recovered
they
say
he
was
on
his
or
as
the
saying
is
died
triumphantly
but
the
darkeys
report
that
the
devil
came
straight
down
with
a
chariot
and
drove
him
off
that
fellow
whitecar
i
reserving
said
clayton
to
punish
when
i
can
use
him
to
sustain
an
argument
in
favor
of
admitting
negro
testimony
in
kidnapping
cases
without
that
admission
these
kidnappers
can
not
be
convicted
even
patty
cannon
here
may
escape
us
though
she
has
killed
white
men
sorden

these
evils
out
exclaimed
randel
put
it
into
poetry
and
he
began
to
recite
to
dark
naswaddox
forest
fled
the
murderer
from
the
main
and
with
the
otter
laid
his
head
amid
the
swamp
and
cane
nothing
can
pursue
my
ear
from
travelled
paths
astray
i
shall
forget
from
year
to
year
the
world
beyond
the
bay
the
hunted
man
one
morning
heard
a
whistle
near
and
strong
and
in
the
night
a
fiery
light
the
thickets
flashed
among
the
demon
of
the
engine
rushed
along
on
blazing
beams
the
hound
the
murderer
had
flushed
the
outlaw
path
was
steam
the
cry
of
hate
from
the
crowd
around
the
as
it
awoke
patty
cannon
last
anger
also
determined
her
last
crime
fear
was
relative
in
her
she
had
neither
the
fear
of
men
nor
of
shame
and
only
of
death
as
it
involved
a
hereafter
whether
that
hereafter
was
a
latent
conviction
in
her
mind
or
the
vivid
admonition
of
guilt
and
dead
men
eyes
peering
over
her
dreams
and
into
the
silent
lonely
watches
of
haunted
midnights
who
shall
tell
there
is
no
analysis
of
a
native
and
ancient
depravity
it
was
sown
in
the
marrow
it
strengthens
in
the
bone
and
with
a
cunning
daring
gambles
upon
the
faith
of
living
and
of
dying
not
its
very
fears
push
it
onward
in
crime
and
make
it
cruelly
tantalize
its
own
fate
as
cowards
lean
over
graveyard
walls
and
shout
with
an
inner
trembling
come
forth
i
dare
you
so
had
this
woman
conscious
of
her
deserts
bullied
eternal
justice
through
its
long
postponements
never
doubting
while
ever
vexing
the
spirit
of
god
until
the
number
of
her
crimes
crowded
the
tablet
of
her
memory
and
out
of
the
hideous
gulf
of
her
past
life
gazed
faces
without
names
and
deeds
without
memoranda
a
procession
the
longer
that
strangers
were
in
it
and
shrinking
from
her
yet
pressing
on
exclaimed
her
name
or
only
shrieked
is
she
as
if
her
name
was
nothing
to
her
curse
sleeping
in
her
chains
there
were
children
eyes
watching
her
from
corners
as
if
to
say
give
us
the
whole
life
we
would
have
lived
but
for
you
as
her
swollen
limbs
festered
to
the
irons
there
were
babies
cries
floating
in
the
air
that
seemed
to
draw
near
her
breasts
as
if
for
food
and
suddenly
convulse
there
in
screams
of
pain
and
move
away
with
the
sounds
of
suffocation
she
had
heard
as
they
expired
all
night
there
were
callers
on
her
and
whom
they
were
no
one
could
tell
but
the
jailer
family
saw
her
lips
moving
and
her
eyes
consult
the
air
as
if
she
was
faintly
trying
bravado
upon
certain
ghosts
who
had
come
with
bills
long
overdue
and
demanded
payment
and
went
out
only
to
come
again
and
again
some
of
these
mystic
visitors
she
would
jeer
at
and
defy
and
stamp
her
feet
as
if
they
had
no
rights
in
equity
against
her
soul
having
been
on
vicious
errands
when
they
met
their
ends
and
bankrupts
in
the
court
of
pity
but
suddenly
a
helpless
something
would
appear
and
paralyze
her
with
its
little
wail
like
a
babeless
mother
or
a
motherless
babe
and
with
her
forehead
wet
with
sweat
of
agony
she
would
affect
to
chuckle
and
would
whisper
nothin
but
niggers
nothin
more
day
brought
her
some
relief
but
also
other
cares
and
of
these
the
chief
was
the
care
of
money
she
had
been
a
spendthrift
all
her
life
and
robbed
mankind
of
life
and
liberty
to
enjoy
the
selfish
dissipation
of
spending
their
and
what
had
she
bought
with
it
nothing
nothing
to
spend
it
only
she
had
wrecked
her
sex
and
her
soul
to
spend
it
for
such
trifles
as
children
want
candy
and
common
ornaments
a
dance
and
a
treat
a
gift
for
some
boor
or
forester
or
even
negro
she
was
misleading
or
to
establish
a
silly
reputation
for
generosity
generous
at
the
expense
of
human
happiness
and
of
robbing
people
of
liberty
and
life
merely
for
now
she
had
none
to
appease
the
greeds
of
habit
intensified
by
real
necessity
no
money
to
buy
dainties
or
even
liquor
no
money
to
spend
upon
the
jailer
family
and
keep
the
reputation
of
kindness
alive
no
money
for
decent
apparel
to
appear
in
court
none
to
corrupt
the
law
or
to
hire
witnesses
and
attorneys
the
two
demons
she
had
created
alternately
seized
the
day
and
the
night
the
demon
of
money
plagued
her
all
day
the
demon
of
murder
pursued
her
all
night
every
morning
she
had
insatiate
wants
all
night
she
had
remorseless
visitors
and
close
before
the
gallows
filled
the
view
with
the
devil
tying
the
noose
that
devil
she
plainly
saw
so
busy
on
the
gallows
fitting
his
ropes
and
shrouds
and
long
and
he
evaded
her
as
if
he
had
no
commerce
with
her
now
he
was
a
cool
and
wistful
man
perfectly
happy
in
the
prospect
of
getting
her
and
not
anxious
about
it
so
sure
was
he
of
her
soon
and
complete
possession
he
was
always
out
in
the
when
she
looked
there
fixing
his
ropes
sliding
the
nooses
examining
the
gallows
like
a
conscientious
carpenter
and
in
his
complacent
smile
was
an
awful
terror
that
froze
her
dumb
he
seemed
so
impersonal
so
joyous
so
industrious
as
if
he
had
waited
for
her
like
a
long
creditor
and
compounded
the
interest
on
her
sins
till
the
infernal
sum
made
him
a
millionaire
in
torments
a
devil
it
was
real
as
a
man
a
slavemaster
to
whose
quiet
love
of
cruelty
eternal
death
was
not
enough
a
man
whose
unscarred
age
old
as
the
rising
sun
still
came
and
went
in
immortal
youthfulness
and
satisfaction
but
for
the
nonce
forgetting
other
debtors
in
the
grip
he
had
on
her
as
his
majestic
expiation
for
his
own
shortcomings
he
looked
like
a
storekeeper
a
man
of
accounts
a
cosmopolitan
kidnapper
who
knew
a
good
article
and
had
it
now
she
was
so
terrified
that
she
wanted
to
cry
to
him
and
see
if
he
would
not
remit
that
business
method
and
become
more
human
and
sauce
her
back
but
no
the
longer
she
watched
the
less
he
looked
towards
her
though
she
knew
his
smile
meant
no
one
else
to
hang
upon
his
cord
was
very
little
to
go
with
him
after
it
was
stretched
down
the
burning
grates
of
hell
and
see
him
all
so
cool
and
busy
in
her
misery
was
the
gnawing
vulture
at
her
heart
in
vain
she
tried
to
throw
responsibility
for
her
sins
upon
a
vague
false
parentage
and
fatherhood
and
say
that
she
was
bred
to
robbery
and
vice
a
something
in
her
heart
responded
no
you
had
beauty
and
health
and
chaste
lovers
whom
you
rejected
or
tempted
and
a
mind
that
was
ever
clear
and
knew
right
from
wrong
conscience
never
gave
you
up
though
drenched
in
innocent
blood
the
monitor
revived
and
cried
aloud
like
the
striking
of
a
clock
but
never
was
obeyed
thus
haunted
deserted
peeped
in
upon
from
the
hereafter
racked
with
vain
needs
her
outlets
closed
to
every
escape
or
subterfuge
revenge
itself
dead
and
disease
assisting
conscience
to
banish
sleep
the
wretched
woman
crawled
to
her
window
one
day
and
saw
the
helpless
effigy
of
her
sex
exposed
there
for
doing
an
act
of
humanity
and
instantly
an
instinct
she
immediately
obeyed
exacted
from
her
one
last
familiar
heartless
deed
to
show
the
crowd
that
even
she
patty
cannon
the
murderess
had
no
respect
for
a
nigger
that
doctrine
long
survived
her
though
she
found
it
old
when
she
came
among
them
she
aimed
an
egg
at
the
breast
of
her
sex
and
with
a
barefaced
grin
she
saw
it
strike
and
burst
the
next
moment
the
crowd
had
recognized
and
defied
her
in
the
exasperation
of
their
shout
and
of
being
no
longer
praised
even
for
insulting
a
negro
a
convulsion
of
desperate
rage
overcame
the
murderess
too
helpless
to
retort
in
any
other
way
yet
in
uncontrollable
recklessness
she
exclaimed
they
never

see

and
swallowed
the
arsenic
she
had
concealed
in
her
bosom
that
night
she
died

in

chapter

the
judge
remarried
vesta
found
her
circle
reunited
though
with
many
absentees
at
princess
anne
aunt
hominy
took
her
place
in
the
kitchen
and
cooked
with
all
her
former
art
but
her
voice
and
understanding
were
gone
and
she
never
would
go
past
the
entailed
hat
and
still
regarded
it
as
nearly
as
could
be
made
out
as
the
cause
of
all
her
errors
and
dangers
though
she
seemed
to
admit
its
unevadable
dominion
the
poor
woman

finding
samson
hat
in
time
wishing
to
have
a
partner
in
the
old
storehouse
where
he
had
become
the
only
resident
had
faith
enough
left
to
make
her
third
marriage
with
him
and
his
means
not
only
made
good
the
property
she
had
lost
but
the
hale
old
man
presented
her
with
a
babe
boy
which
took
the
name
of
meshach
phoebus
and
on
which
judge
custis
sagely
remarked
that
it
ought
to
have
been
a
nigger
having
both
the
fiery
furnace
and
the
blazing
sun
in
its
name
on

death
which
resulted
from
rheumatism
reaching
his

james
phoebus
in
the
west
where
he
lived
happily
with
his
bride
and
stepson
and
often
wrote
home
of
a
friend
he
had
there
named
abe
lincoln
who
made
voyages
with
him
down
the
mississippi
both
ellenora
phoebus
and
hulda

reared
western
families
which
played
effective
parts
in
the
drama
of
civilization
vesta
lost
no
time
in
setting
free
every
slave
about
teackle
hall
and
on
the
farms
with
the
approval
of
her
father
and
husband
also
and
roxy
became
the
wife
of
whatcoat
the
rescued
freedman
and
the
replacer
at
her
mistress
side
of
poor
virgie
whose
body
was
brought
home
and
interred
by
the
church
where
she
had
been
her
white
sister
bridesmaid
the
grief
of
vesta
for
virgie
was
quiet
but
long
and
as
that
of
an
equal
not
a
mistress
though
she
may
have
never
known
how
equal
in
the
fatalities
thronging
about
her
marriage
vesta
observed
one
signal
blessing
the
complete
reform
of
her
father
habits
he
drank
nothing
whatever
supplying
with
fruit
the
pleasures
of
wine
and
with
exercise
and
business
on
her
husband
behests
the
vagrant
tours
he
once
made
in
the
forest
for
politics
and
amours
aware
of
his
sociable
and
voluptuous
nature
vesta
desired
to
see
him
married
again
to
complete
and
secure
his
reformation
and
while
she
was
yet
puzzling
her
brain
to
think
of
a
wife
to
suit
him
he
solved
the
problem
himself
by
cleanly
cutting
out
rhoda
holland
from
under
the
attentions
of
william
tilghman
rhoda
had
rapidly
learned
and
had
corrected
her
grammar
without
losing
her
humor
and
her
taste
for
dress
and
her
free
warm
spirits
soon
made
her
an
elegant
woman
in
whom
fortunately
or
unfortunately
a
very
decided
worldly
ambition
germinated
at
once
the
proof
and
the
vindication
of
she
may
have
patterned
it
upon
her
uncle
or
it
may
have
emanated
from
his
ambitious
family
stock
which
in
and
around
him
had
wakened
to
the
vigor
of
a
previous
century
but
it
was
so
different
from
vesta
nature
that
while
it
but
made
nobler
her
soul
of
tranquil
piety
and
ease
of
ladyhood
vesta
was
interested
in
rhoda
and
business
coquetry
a
higher
vitality
than
vesta
rhoda
holland
soon
showed
in
the
superficial
senses
more
acuteness
of
sight
and
insight
quicker
intuitions
more
though
not
selfishness
less
scrupulousness
perhaps
in
dealing
with
her
lovers
and
with
fidelity
and
virtue
a
pushing
spirit
that
vesta
only
mildly
reproved
since
she
made
the
allowance
that
it
was
in
part
inspired
by
herself
take
care
dear
vesta
said
one
day
that
you
grow
not
away
from
your
heart
with
all
improving
there
is
a
growth
that
begets
the
heart
disease
do
you
love
cousin
william
tilghman
he
is
too
true
a
man
to
be
hurt
in
his
feelings
nothing
in
this
world
rhoda
is
a
substitute
for
principle
in
woman
i
do
want
to
lose
principle
auntie
rhoda
said
but
i
am
afraid
i
love
life
too
much
to
be
a
pastor
wife
i
never
saw
the
world
for
so
long
that
i
wild
in
it
i
want
to
go
to
look
and
to
see
everywhere
i
feel
my
heart
is
in
my
wings
and
must
i
go
sit
on
a
nest
miss
somers
the
question
is
dear
do
you
love
auntie
i
reckon
i
love
william
as
much
as
he
does
me
but
he
is
devoted
rhoda
if
i
thought
i
had
the
whole
full
heart
of
william
aunt
vesta
and
it
would
give
him
real
pain
to
disappoint
him
i
would
marry
him
but
i
have
watched
him
like
a
cat
watches
a
mouse
he
wants
to
marry
me
to
make
other
people
than
himself
happy
to
reconcile
you
and
uncle
more
to
take
uncle
more
into
your
family
by
marrying
his
niece
william
is
trying
to
love
uncle
meshach
like
a
good
christian
but
aunt
vesta
he
thinks
more
of
your
little
toe
than
of
my
whole
body
the
crimson
color
came
to
vesta
cheeks
so
unwillingly
so
mountingly
that
she
felt
ashamed
of
it
and
in
place
of
anger
that
many
wives
so
exposed
would
have
shown
she
shed
some
quiet
tears
rhoda
do
you
know
i
am
your
uncle
wife
rhoda
threw
her
arms
around
her
forgive
me
dear
when
you
tell
me
aunt
vesta
that
william
loves
me
dearly
i
gladly
marry
him
i
only
want
auntie
not
to
make
happiness
impossible
when
to
wait
would
be
better
vesta
wondered
what
rhoda
meant
but
kissing
her
friend
tenderly
again
rhoda
whispered
auntie
it
not
selfishness
that
makes
me
behave
so
indeed
i
love
william
it
a
sacrifice
to
let
him
go
vesta
looked
up
and
found
rhoda
eyes
this
time
full
of
tears
strange
tender
girl
cried
vesta
what
makes
you
cry
yet
for
some
unspoken
perhaps
unknown
reasons
they
both
shed
together
the
tears
of
a
deeper
respect
for
each
other
soon
afterwards
judge
custis
being
sent
to
annapolis
by
milburn
was
requested
to
take
rhoda
along
as
a
part
of
her
education
and
vesta
went
also
at
her
husband
desire
she
feared
that
her
father
devoted
as
he
had
become
to
her
business
interests
still
disliked
him
and
bore
him
resentment
and
vesta
wished
to
see
not
only
outward
but
inward
reconcilement
of
those
two
men
from
one
of
whom
she
drew
her
being
and
towards
the
other
began
to
feel
sacred
yet
awful
ties
that
took
hold
on
life
and
death
they
were
taken
to
the
landing
by
milburn
and
the
young
rector
and
there
as
the
steamboat
approached
tilghman
said
rhoda
your
uncle
has
consented
he
wishes
us
to
marry
i
ask
you
before
all
of
them
to
consider
my
proposal
while
you
are
gone
and
come
home
with
your
reply
the
impetuous
girl
threw
her
arms
around
him
and
kissed
him
in
silence
and
covering
her
face
with
her
veil
awaited
in
uncontrollable
tears
the
steamboat
that
was
to
carry
her
to
the
mightier
world
she
had
never
seen
beyond
the
bay
after
she
reached
the
steamer
her
stillness
and
grief
continued
and
going
to
bed
that
night
she
turned
up
her
face
discolored
by
tears
for
vesta
to
kiss
her
like
a
child
and
faltered
aunty
do
think
i
have
no
principle
indeed
i
have
some

half
a
century
the
senior
of
baltimore
and
the
first
town

take
root
in
all
the
chesapeake
land
was
now
almost
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
old
and
the
stern
monument
of

of

puritans
from

to
organize
their

after

the

and
the

insurrection
it
was
now
in
a
state
of
comfortable
decline
having
yielded
to
baltimore
and
to
washington
its
once
superior
influence
and
society
but
a
lobby
the
first
in
magnitude
ever
seen
in
this
province
had
assembled
in
the
name
of
canals
and
railroads
to
compete
for
the
bonded
aid
of
the
legislature
and
judge
custis
was
leading
the
forlorn
hope
of
the
eastern
shore
for
some
of
the
subsidy
so
liberally
showered
upon
the
cormorant
baltimore
judge
custis
was
instructed
to
lobby
at
annapolis
for
one
million
dollars
or
only
part
of
the
grants
made
by
the
state
and
he
was
to
draw
on
meshach
milburn
for
funds
who
meantime
continued
out
of
his
private
resources
to
grade
and
buy
right
of
way
for
one
hundred
and
thirty
miles
of
railroad
the
adventure
was
gigantic
for
the
private
capital
of
that
day
and
the
unpopularity
of
the
adventurer
at
home
was
soon
testified
at
the
state
capital
vesta
whose
carriage
had
been
brought
over
looked
with
a
gentle
patriotism
being
herself
of
divided
maryland
and
virginia
sympathies
upon
the
little
peninsulated
capital
with
its
old
roomy
houses
of
colonial
brick
its
circles
and
triangles
in
the
public
ways
and
the
unchanged
names
of
such
streets
as
king
george
prince
george
and
the
duke
of
gloucester
but
rhoda
was
excited
to
the
height
of
state
pride
in
everything
she
saw
and
with
strong
faculty
seized
on
the
historical
and
political
relations
of
annapolis
till
judge
custis
said
vesta
that
girl
is
of
the
old
rebel
milburn
stock
i
know
she
takes
it
all
in
like
a
wild
duck
diving
for
the
bay
celery
with
two
such
beautiful
women
to
speak
for
it
the
eastern
shore
railroad
seemed
at
first
to
have
many
friends
but
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
the
enterprising
elements
about
baltimore
to
yield
a
point
however
complaisant
they
might
appear
vesta
did
not
go
into
general
company
but
her
influence
was
mildly
exercised
in
her
rooms
at
the
large
old
hotel
and
in
her
carriage
as
she
made
excursions
in
pleasant
weather
to
the
south
and
west
rivers
to
the
forest
of
prince
george
and
to
the
thrifty
quakers
of
montgomery
she
wrote
and
received
a
daily
letter
her
husband
being
attentive
and
tender
despite
his
growing
cares
as
he
had
promised
to
be
on
that
severe
day
he
made
his
suit
to
her
but
the
story
of
her
sacrifice
shamefully
exaggerated
with
all
that
intensity
of
expression
habitual
in
a
society
whenever
money
is
the
stake
and
denunciation
the
game
was
used
to
injure
her
interests
milburn
was
described
as
a
vile
yankee
type
of
miser
and
overreacher
who
had
plotted
against
the
fortune
of
a
gentleman
and
the
virtue
of
his
daughter
for
a
long
series
of
remorseless
years
local
opposition
affirmed
that
he
would
use
the
railroad
to
ruin
other
gentry
and
oppress
his
native
region
and
that
he
was
a
philadelphia
emissary
and
an
abolitionist
scheming
to
create
a
new
state
of
the
three
jurisdictions
across
the
bay
judge
custis
with
his
great
popularity
did
not
escape
censure
he
was
said
to
have
winked
at
the
surrender
of
his
child
for
money
and
ambition
and
to
have
broken
the
heart
of
his
estimable
wife
after
he
had
lost
her
fortune
in
an
iron
furnace
senator
clayton
whose
mother
had
originated
near
annapolis
made
a
visit
there
from
washington
and
was
entrapped
into
saying
that
delaware
would
furnish
all
needful
railway
facilities
for
the
eastern
shore
and
that
two
railways
there
would
never
pay
finally
judge
custis
wrote
to
his
to
come
to
annapolis
and
meet
these
misstatements
in
person
milburn
came
and
his
pride
being
irritated
by
the
nature
of
the
opposition
he
wore
to
the
scene
of
the
combat
his
ancestral
hat
he
became
at
once
the
most
marked
figure
in
maryland
in
one
end
of
the
state
he
was
caricatured
in
drawings
and
verses
as
the
generic
man
wearing
such
a
hat
because
he
had
not
heard
of
any
later
styles
the
connection
of
a
man
of
last
century
hat
with
such
a
progressive
thing
as
a
railroad
seemed
to
excite
everybody
risibilities
his
railroad
was
called
the
hat
line
even
in
the
debates
and
coarse
people
and
negroes
were
hired
by
wits
in
the
lobby
to
attend
the
legislature
with
petitions
for
the
eastern
shore
railroad
the
whole
delegation
wearing
antique
and
preposterous
hats
gathered
up
from
all
the
old
counties
and
from
the
of
baltimore
and
in
that
day
queer
hats
were
very
common
as
animal
skins
of
great
endurance
were
still
used
to
manufacture
them
from
somerset
word
was
sent
that
milburn
retained
his
hat
from
no
amiable
weakness
or
eccentricity
but
because
he
had
entered
a
vow
never
to
abandon
it
till
he
had
put
every
superior
he
had
under
his
feet
and
that
he
was
a
victim
of
gross
forest
superstition
and
had
made
a
bargain
with
the
devil
who
allowed
him
to
prosper
as
long
as
he
braved
society
with
this
tile
the
hotel
servants
chuckled
as
he
went
in
and
out
the
oystermen
and
called
jocosely
to
each
other
as
he
passed
by
respectable
people
said
he
could
have
no
consideration
for
his
wife
to
degrade
her
by
raising
the
derision
of
the
town
judge
custis
finally
remarked
milburn
i
resolved
many
years
ago
never
to
address
you
again
on
the
subject
of
your
dress
my
duty
makes
me
break
the
resolve
your
hat
is
the
worst
enemy
of
your
railroad
vesta
however
was
the
entailed
hat
greatest
victim
it
lay
upon
her
spirits
like
a
shroud
nervous
and
apprehensive
as
she
had
become
the
perpetual
admonition
and
friction
of
this
article
drove
her
into
silence
and
gloom
poisoned
the
air
and
blocked
up
the
sunlight
made
going
forth
a
constant
running
of
the
gantlet
and
hospitality
a
comedy
and
human
observation
a
wondering
stare
the
hat
was
the
silent
unindicated
thing
that
stood
between
her
and
her
husband
and
the
rest
of
the
world
she
never
mentioned
it
for
she
saw
that
it
was
forbidden
ground
kind
and
liberal
as
her
husband
was
in
every
other
thing
she
dared
not
allude
to
a
matter
which
had
become
the
centre
of
his
nervous
organization
like
an
indurated
sore
and
yet
she
saw
from
other
than
selfish
considerations
that
this
hat
was
his
own
worst
foe
some
positive
vice
and
he
had
none
some
calculating
conspiracy
and
he
was
direct
as
the
day
some
base
amusement
or
hidden
habit
or
acrid
disease
would
hold
him
in
captivity
and
pervert
his
heart
less
than
this
simple
aberration
of
behavior
had
he
been
a
hunchback
men
would
have
overlooked
it
a
hideous
goitre
or
wen
they
would
not
have
resented
but
extreme
gentility
or
courtesy
could
not
refrain
from
turning
to
look
a
second
time
at
a
man
with
a
beautiful
lady
on
his
arm
and
a
steeple
hat
upon
his
head
the
existence
of
any
subject
man
and
wife
must
not
talk
together
upon
which
is
yet
a
daily
ingredient
of
comfort
and
display
itself
disarranges
their
economy
and
finally
becomes
the
chronic
intruder
of
their
household
and
when
it
is
a
trifle
it
seems
the
more
an
obstacle
because
there
is
no
reasoning
about
it
this
hat
had
long
ceased
to
be
external
it
was
worn
on
milburn
heart
and
stifled
the
healthy
throbbing
there
it
made
two
men
of
him
the
outer
and
the
household
man
and
like
the
corsican
brothers
they
were
ever
conscious
of
each
other
and
a
word
to
one
aroused
the
clairvoyant
sensibility
if
people
would
only
not
observe
him
vesta
said
i
think
he
would
lay
his
hat
aside
but
that
is
impossible
and
all
his
pride
is
in
the
unending
conflict
with
a
law
of
everlasting
society
who
sets
a
fashion
we
do
not
know
who
dares
to
set
one
that
is
obsolete
must
be
a
martyr
independence
no
one
can
practise
but
a
lunatic
oh
what
tyranny
exists
that
no
laws
can
reach
and
how
much
of
society
is
mere
formality
vesta
pitied
her
husband
but
the
disease
was
beyond
her
cure
she
had
anticipated
some
compensation
for
her
marriage
in
a
larger
life
and
society
and
in
the
exercise
of
her
mind
especially
in
art
and
music
yet
these
were
purely
social
things
with
woman
and
the
baneful
hat
was
ever
darkening
her
threshold
and
closing
the
vista
of
every
other
one
she
meditated
escaping
from
it
by
a
visit
to
europe
which
her
father
had
promised
her
before
his
embarrassments
and
which
had
been
spoken
of
by
milburn
as
due
her
in
the
way
of
musical
perfection
uncle
rhoda
holland
said
one
day
do
put
off
that
old
hat
aunt
vesta
could
love
you
so
much
better
people
think
it
is
cruel
uncle
oh
listen
to
your
wife
heart
and
not
to
your
pride
stop
said
milburn
one
more
reference
to
my
honest
hat
and
you
shall
be
sent
back
to
sinepuxent
and
mrs
somers
it
may
have
been
this
dreadful
threat
or
rising
ambition
or
the
fascinations
of
judge
custis
position
and
attentions
and
remarkable
gallantry
that
disposed
rhoda
to
turn
her
worldly
sagacity
upon
the
father
of
her
friend
the
visit
to
annapolis
occupied
the
whole
winter
as
it
proceeded
judge
custis
suppressing
the
temptations
of
the
table
and
feeling
his
later
responsibilities
thoughtfully
and
desirous
of
a
fixed
settlement
in
a
home
again
felt
a
powerful
passion
to
possess
rhoda
holland
he
contended
against
it
in
vain
her
beauty
and
coquetry
and
ambition
too
seized
his
fancy
and
worked
strongly
upon
his
imagination
he
had
seen
her
grow
from
a
forest
rose
to
be
the
noblest
flower
of
the
garden
superb
in
health
rich
in
colors
tall
and
bright
and
warm
and
easily
aware
of
her
conquests
and
with
a
magical
touch
and
encouragement
she
began
to
lead
him
on
from
mere
mischief
he
was
wise
and
observant
of
women
and
he
threw
himself
in
the
place
of
her
instructor
and
courtier
she
became
his
pupil
and
an
exacting
one
driving
his
energies
onward
demanding
his
full
attention
stimulating
his
mind
and
vesta
soon
saw
that
her
father
was
a
blind
captive
in
the
cool
yet
meshes
of
her
connection
is
there
any
law
husband
vesta
asked
to
prevent
rhoda
marrying
judge
custis
i
think
not
there
is
no
consanguinity
in
a
society
where
every
degree
of
cousins
marry
together
it
would
be
as
gratuitous
to
interfere
in
such
a
marriage
as
to
forbid
my
hat
by
law
he
is
so
enamoured
of
her
said
vesta
that
i
fear
the
results
of
her
refusing
him
upon
his
habits
father
is
a
better
man
than
he
ever
was
a
wife
that
can
retain
his
interest
will
now
keep
him
steady
all
his
life
the
adjournment
of
the
legislature
was
at
hand
another
year
and
perhaps
years
unforeseen
in
number
were
to
be
occupied
in
the
same
slow
illusive
quest
judge
custis
found
himself
one
morning
early
above
the
dome
of
the
old
where
he
frequently
went
at
that
hour
with
rhoda
holland
to
look
out
upon
the
bay
and
the
town
and
severn
silver
wave
reflected
he
turned
to
her
with
a
sparkle
of
humor
yet
a
flush
of
the
cheek
and
said
my
girl
what
is
to
be
your
answer
to
pastor
tilghman
marriage
offer
it
can
not
be
then
i
am
free
to
ask
for
another
rhoda
you
have
seen
that
i
am
foolish
for
you
i
was
your
admirer
when
you
were
a
poor
forest
girl
and
when
you
were
a
married
man
rhoda
interrupted
how
splendid
and
sly
you
were
but
even
then
i
was
delighted
that
a
great
man
like
you
could
even
flirt
with
me
perhaps
you
will
cut
up
the
same
way
again
no
rhoda
this
is
my
last
opportunity
i
will
devote
to
you
my
remaining
life
i
am
but
it
is
the
best
in
maryland
you
shall
have
the
devotion
of
i
want
to
be
taken
to
washington
rhoda
said
i
think
i
could
marry
an
old
man
if
he
took
me
there
i
will
run
for
congress
then
you
will
make
a
great
woman
in
public
life
i
do
not
ask
you
to
love
me
but
to
let
me
love
you
oh
my
child
marriage
has
been
a
tragedy
with
me
i
will
be
a
repentant
and
a
fond
husband
hear
my
selfishness
speak
and
make
the
sacrifice
if
i
say
said
rhoda
it
is
not
to
settle
down
and
nurse
you
you
are
to
be
what
you
have
been
this
winter
a
beau
and
an
ever
fond
and
gallant
gentleman
yes
as
long
as
time
will
let
me
then
say
no
more
about
it
rhoda
answered
with
a
little
pallor
if
the
rest
are
willing
a
poor
girl
like
me
will
not
refuse
you
but
say
like
ruth
thy
skirt
over
thine
handmaid
for
thou
art
a
near
kinsman
i
love
your
daughter
meshach
milburn
not
more
than
half
pleased
with
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
hastened
to
princess
anne
in
advance
and
sought
william
tilghman
dear
friend
he
said
i
hope
your
heart
was
not
committed
to
my
wayward
niece
has
she
engaged
herself
to
another
cousin
meshach
yes
to
judge
custis
you
know
what
a
taking
way
he
has
with
girls
it
was
not
my
match
william
milburn
looked
at
the
young
man
and
beheld
no
disappointment
on
his
face
rather
a
flush
of
spirit
cousin
meshach
he
said
cheerfully
i
thought
i
could
make
rhoda
happy
i
thought
i
interpreted
her
right
since
i
was
mistaken
it
is
better
that
she
has
been
sincere
no
my
heart
is
still
a
bachelor
and
a
priest
see
cousin
the
bishop
has
sent
for
me
to
take
a
larger
field
he
united
rhoda
and
the
judge
as
he
had
married
his
first
love
to
another
she
was
pale
and
in
tears
he
kissed
her
at
the
altar
and
gave
his
hand
to
the
judge
warmly
i
know
you
will
be
a
better
christian
cousin
daniel
god
has
given
you
much
love
on
the
earth
our
prayers
for
you
have
been
answered
vesta
was
disappointed
expecting
to
see
william
made
happy
in
a
marriage
with
rhoda
chapter
xlvi
the
curse
of
the
hat
as
the
spring
burst
upon
princess
anne
in
cherry
blossoms
and
dogwood
flowers
in
herring
and
shad
weighting
the
river
seines
and
broods
of
young
chickens
and
pullulating
and
as
the
time
of
fruit
and
corn
and
early
cantaloupe
followed
the
life
in
human
veins
also
unfolded
in
infant
fruit
and
vesta
became
a
mother
the
forest
and
the
court
had
harmonized
in
the
offspring
and
the
young
boy
took
the
name
of
custis
milburn
healthy
and
comely
as
if
society
had
made
the
match
for
nature
the
infant
flourished
without
a
day
ailing
and
grew
upon
its
eyes
like
a
miracle
having
the
symmetry
and
loveliness
of
the
mother
and
the
bold
challenging
countenance
of
the
father
and
to
meshach
it
brought
the
satisfaction
of
an
improved
posterity
and
an
heir
to
his
success
to
vesta
compensation
for
the
loss
of
worldly
society
she
found
more
joy
in
teackle
hall
with
this
wondrous
product
of
her
sacrifice
and
pain
than
with
the
admiration
of
all
the
good
families
in
maryland
and
a
sense
of
warmth
and
gratitude
sprang
to
her
conscience
towards
the
father
of
this
matchless
gift
i
have
not
given
him
my
whole
loyalty
she
reflected
with
exacting
piety
i
have
let
trifles
stand
before
my
vows
accordingly
when
milburn
and
accusing
himself
of
hard
conditions
in
exacting
a
marriage
without
love
came
one
day
with
all
the
magnanimity
of
a
new
parent
before
his
wife
to
make
some
restitution
she
surprised
him
by
arising
and
kissing
him
sir
i
have
been
very
proud
and
stubborn
do
forgive
me
he
pressed
her
to
his
breast
while
his
tears
ran
over
her
face
honey
he
said
at
length
what
a
mockery
my
crime
to
you
has
been
to
think
that
you
could
ever
love
me
no
i
will
give
you
freedom
dear
as
your
captivity
is
to
me
your
cage
shall
open
and
you
shall
fly
vesta
stepped
back
at
these
strange
words
and
waited
for
him
to
explain
he
continued
i
will
send
you
to
italy
with
our
child
your
father
shall
go
too
if
you
desire
go
from
me
and
these
unloved
conditions
this
hateful
bondage
and
constraint
his
tears
flowed
fast
again
but
he
let
them
fall
ungrudged
find
in
your
music
and
your
noble
mind
forgetfulness
of
this
unworthy
marriage
i
can
live
in
the
recollection
of
the
blessing
you
have
been
to
me
what
said
vesta
do
you
command
me
to
leave
you
yes
let
it
be
that
i
know
how
conscientious
you
are
my
darling
but
it
is
your
duty
to
go
a
hard
struggle
is
before
me
i
am
deeply
embarked
in
an
untried
business
now
i
can
spare
the
money
go
and
find
happiness
in
a
happier
land
she
went
to
him
again
and
put
her
arms
around
him
leave
you
she
said
what
have
i
done
to
be
driven
away
how
could
i
reconcile
myself
to
let
you
live
alone
better
or
for
worse
i
said
god
has
made
it
better
and
better
every
day
he
held
her
head
between
his
palms
and
looked
into
her
eyes
to
see
if
she
spoke
from
the
heart
husband
she
whispered
i
love
you
the
minds
of
both
husband
and
wife
after
this
reconcilement
turned
to
the
disturbing
hat
as
the
subject
of
their
estrangement
hitherto
said
milburn
to
himself
what
a
sinner
i
have
been
to
distress
that
poor
child
with
my
miserable
hat
at
the
first
opportunity
she
gives
me
i
will
lay
it
aside
forever
said
vesta
to
her
father
and
his
bride
what
a
wicked
heart
i
have
kept
to
oppose
my
husband
in
such
a
little
thing
as
his
good
old
hat
the
badge
of
his
reverence
to
his
family
and
of
his
bravery
to
an
impertinent
age
i
have
let
it
discolor
my
married
life
and
all
the
sunshine
but
my
baby
has
melted
my
obdurate
heart
come
unite
with
me
and
let
us
show
him
that
everything
he
wears
we
will
adopt
proudly
therefore
when
milburn
next
went
out
his
wife
came
with
a
beaming
face
and
elastic
step
and
put
on
his
head
his
steeple
hat
he
looked
at
her
grimly
but
she
stopped
his
protest
with
a
kiss
he
thought
to
introduce
the
subject
to
judge
custis
but
that
fond
bridegroom
broke
in
with
milburn
you
a
game
fellow
it
was
impudent
in
me
to
say
one
word
about
your
hat
i
get
one
like
it
myself
if
i
can
find
one
tut
tut
man
it
becomes
you
say
no
more
about
it
milburn
undertook
to
make
the
explanation
to
his
niece
but
before
he
could
well
begin
she
cried
uncle
meshach
aunt
vesta
is
just
in
love
with
your
hat
she
wo
hear
of
your
wearing
any
other
we
all
going
to
stand
by
it
uncle
a
man
chooses
his
own
verdict
by
a
long
course
of
behavior
austerity
in
the
family
begets
fear
an
affectation
whether
of
folly
or
resentment
is
at
last
credited
to
nature
man
is
seldom
allowed
to
escape
from
the
trap
of
his
own
temperament
so
meshach
milburn
never
obtained
the
opportunity
to
relieve
himself
from
the
affliction
with
which
he
had
afflicted
others
like
an
impostor
who
has
established
the
claim
of
deafness

mankind
bawls
in
his
ear
the
hatted
spectre
was
made
to
feel
uncomfortable
when
he
put
off
his
tile
his
consistency
was
at
once
on
trial
he
was
like
a
boy
who
had
pricked
a
cross
upon
his
hand
in
india
ink
and
growing
to
be
a
man
with
taste
and
position
sees
the
indelible
advertisement
of
his
vulgarity
whenever
he
takes
a
human
hand
to
have
put
on
any
other
hat
would
have
subjected
him
to
new
hoots
and
comments
and
made
himself
publicly
smile
at
his
own
folly
he
must
have
climbed
as
high
as
the
pillory
to
explain
the
change
and
make
apology
the
society
he
had
faced
in
defiance
seemed
all
at
once
united
to
refuse
him
a
without
his
entailed
hat
and
it
would
have
taken
the
courage
of
throwing
off
a
and
living
under
a
forgotten
name
to
appear
in
princess
anne
in
a
new
contemporary
milburn
saw
that
he
must
wear
his
old
hat
for
life
he
bent
under
the
servitude
and
was
alone
the
victim
of
it
now
chapter
xlvii
failure
and
restitution
the
railroad
struggle
was
renewed
from
year
to
year
the
legislature
was
annually
beset
by
strong
lobby
forces
and
an
embittered
contest
between
the
potomac
canal
and
the
greater
railway
company
to
strangle
each
other
left
the
eastern

railroad
out
of

began
to
appear
the
railroad
to
washington
was
finally
opened
and
next
to

as
vesta
boy
became
a
young
horseman
and
learned
to
read
the
venerable
at
princess
anne
with
its
years
of

burned
down
during
these
proceedings
and
a
panic
extended
over

at
the
whisper
of
another
nat
turner
rebellion
among
the
slaves
but
no
mention
of
the
thousands
of
abductions
there
was
made
in
the
convention
at
baltimore
where
samuel
seward
and
thaddeus
stevens
nominated
wirt
for
president
because
one
white
man
had
been
stolen
the
murder
of
jacob
cannon
by
owen
daw
did
produce
some
distant
comment
a
little
later
chiefly
because
of
the
apathy
of
the
delaware
society
to
pursue
the
murderer
by
a
long
course
of
usury
and
legal
persecution
the
cannon
brothers
had
become
detested
in
their
own
community
and
when
they
sued
or
daw
for
cutting
down
a
on
one
of
their
farms
he
had
tilled
and
then
enforced
the
judgment
of
ten
dollars

now
a
man
in
growth
and
of
celtic
vindictiveness
loaded
his
gun
and
started
for

at

carried
off
its

there
are

to

the

tenanted
mansion
of
the

and
the
gravestones
which
show
how
jacob
fate
frightened
isaac

to
a

tomb
in
the

john
clayton
had
made
use
of
the
fears
of
calhoun
and
his
nullifiers
who
were
menaced
with
the
penalties
of
treason
by
the
president
to
pass
a
great
protective
tariff
bill
by
their
aid
thus
establishing
the
manufactures
in
the
same
period
with
the
railways
this
triumph
in
the
senate
left
him
free
to
conduct
the
suit
of
randel
against
the
canal
company
which
occupied
as
many
years
as
the
railroad
enterprise
of
meshach
milburn
the
barbarous
system
of
pleadings
was
then
in
full
vogue
though
soon
to
be
weeded
out
even
in
its
parent
england
and
the
law
to
be
made
a
trial
of
facts
instead
of
traverses
demurrers
avoidances
rebutters
and
surrebutters
churned
out
of
the
skim
milk
of
words
pleadings
require
a
bold
dull
mind
to
read
them
now
but
he
tired
his
adversaries
out
and
his
cousin
clayton
who
was
jealous
of
him
had
yet
to
decide
in
his
favor
then
after
the
lapse
of
years
the
issue
came
to
trial
at
the
old
town
of
new

and
from
the
magnitude
of
the
damages
claimed
the
weight
and
number
of
counsel
and
the
novelty
of
trying
a
great
corporation
it
interested
the
lawyers
and
burdened
the
newspapers
and
was
popularly
supposed
to
belong
to
the
class
of

john

ruined
a
fine

a
litigious
man
all
his
life
he
sued
his
successor

fellow
engineer
wright
and
was
nonsuited
he
garnisheed
the
canal
officers
and
beset
the

for
remedial
legislation
and
threatened
clayton
himself
with
damages
yet
had
such
a
fund
of
experience
and
such
vitality
that
he
kept
the
outer
public
beaten
up
like
the
driving
of
wild
beasts
into
the
circle
of
the
hunters
he
had
surveyed

his
projection
half
a

now
looked

with
indifference

himself
to
have
been
born
for
the

in
the
midst
of
many
other
duties
clayton
in

of
time
convicted

on

having
obtained

the
personage
of
our
tale

prosecuted
for
kidnapping
in
order
to
spite
clayton
was
cleared
by
him
at
georgetown
after
a
marvellous
exhibition
of
jury
eloquence
and
repaid
the
obligation
years
after
our
story
closes
by
breaking
a
party
in
the
legislature
of
delaware
where
he
became
a
member
and
sending
clayton
for
the
fourth
time
to
the
american
senate
the
entailed
hat
became
more
common
in
the
streets
of
annapolis
than
it
had
been
in
princess
anne
as
milburn
pressed
his
bill
for
assistance
year
after
year
and
was
shot
through
the
back
with
slanders
from
home
and
hustled
in
front
by
overwhelming
opposition
judge
custis
took
the
field
for
congress
on
the
railroad
issue
and
was
elected
through
the
forest
vote
and
his
wife
went
through
a
washington
season
with
as
much
dignity
as
enjoyment
few
suspecting
that
she
was
not
the
judge
social
equal
the
ancestral
hat
defied
all
worldly
hostility
but
became
the
iron
helmet
to
bend
its
wearer
back
he
prayed
in
secret
for
some
pitying
angel
to
break
the
spell
that
bound
him
to
it
but
none
conceived
that
he
would
let
it
go
his
boy
grew
strong
and
took
his
father
dress
to
be
a
matter
of
course
his
wife
pressed
upon
him
the
nauseous
ornament
he
had
so
long
affected
a
wide
conspiracy
seemed
to
have
been
formed
to
drive
his
head
into
that
hereditary
wigwam
and
he
could
not
escape
it
even
grandmother
tilghman
who
now
was
an
inmate
of
teackle
hall
in
william
absence
of
years
forgot
all
about
the
queer
hat
and
rejoiced
to
herself
that
bill
had
not
married
that
political
girl
milburn
had
maintained
his
financial
solvency
by
turns
and
sorties
that
even
his
enemies
admired
but
a
railroad
built
along
one
man
spine
and
terminated
by
a
steeple
depot
on
his
head
must
wear
out
the
unrelieved
individual
at
last
the
banks
in
baltimore
began
to
break
fierce
riots
ensued
the
state
debt
had
mounted
up
through
aid
to
public
works
to
fifteen
million
dollars
the
eastern
shore
railroad
obtained
too
late
the
vote
of
the
subsidy
expected
and
the
state
treasurer
could
not
find
funds
to
pay
it
the
gazettes
announced
the
failure
of
meshach
milburn
of
the
eastern
shore
without
an
instant
hesitation
vesta
surrendered
her
own
property
and
she
and
rhoda
custis
opened
a
select
school
in
a
part
of
teackle
hall
and
let
the
remainder
for
residences
why
do
you
make
this
sacrifice
asked
her
husband
nobody
expected
it
they
may
say
we
were
married
to
protect
my
parents
vesta
answered
but
not
that
it
was
to
secure
myself
my
boy
shall
have
a
clear
name
his
failure
ended
the
active
life
of
meshach
milburn
too
considerate
of
his
family
to
renew
his
former
low
endeavors
he
became
a
clerk
in
the
county
offices
through
judge
custis
influence
and
wore
his
hat
to
stipendiary
labor
with
the
regularity
but
not
the
rebellious
instincts
of
old
days
becoming
instead
the
victim
of
a
certain
religious
trance
or
apathy
which
deepened
with
time
vesta
saw
that
milburn
misfortune
extinguished
the
last
remnant
of
animosity
in
her
father
mind
and
the
two
men
went
about
together
like
two
old
boys
who
had
both
been
prisoners
of
war
and
were
cured
of
ambition
milburn
resumed
his
forest
walks
and
all
traces
of
ambition
left
his
countenance
and
he
was
as
dead
to
business
things
as
if
he
had
never
risen
above
his
forest
origin
he
often
talked
of
william
tilghman
and
seemed
to
wish
to
see
him
though
for
no
apparent
purpose
the
asiatic
cholera
having
begun
to
make
annual
visits
to
the
united
states
singled
out
one
day
the
wearer
of
the
obsolete
hat
and
put
to
the
sternest
test
of
affection
and
humanity
the
household
at
teackle
hall
whether
from
the
respect
his
steady
purposes
had
given
them
or
the
natural
devotion
in
a
sequestered
society
no
soul
left
his
side
but
it
brought
the
final
visitation
of
poverty
upon
vesta
her
school
was
broken
up
in
a
day
she
dismissed
it
herself
and
calmly
sat
by
her
husband
bed
to
soothe
his
dying
weakness
and
await
the
providence
of
god
he
rapidly
passed
through
the
stages
of
cramp
and
collapse
a
nearly
perished
pulse
and
the
cadaverous
look
of
one
already
dead
yet
his
intellect
by
the
law
of
the
disease
lived
unimpaired
the
stream
can
not
rise
above
the
fountain
he
spoke
huskily
all
we
can
get
from
life
is
love
my
darling
you
have
showered
it
on
me
and
been
thirsty
all
your
days
i
have
been
happy
in
my
duty
vesta
said
you
have
been
kind
to
me
always
we
have
nothing
to
regret
he
wandered
a
little
though
he
looked
at
her
and
seemed
thinking
of
his
mother
where
can
we
go
he
muttered
pitifully
i
burned
the
dear
old
hut
down
it
would
have
been
a
roof
for
my
boy
his
chin
trembled
as
if
he
were
about
to
cry
and
sighed

he
returned
to
perfect
knowledge
in
a
moment
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
vesta
saying
i
leave
you
poor
i
tried
hard
perhaps
his
eye
was
here
arrested
by
some

spoke
meshach
with
a
happy
light
in
his
eyes
oh
i
wanted
to
hear
it
again
yet
he
put
his
hand
up
with
all
his
little
strength
to
push
away
the
intruder
who
would
have
kissed
him
and
whispered

honest

church
bishop
in

god
bless

he
was
lost
again
as
if
he
had
fainted
for
some
time
and
all
kneeling
the
young
bishop
made
a
prayer
when
they
arose
milburn
seemed
speechless
yet
he
tried
to
raise
his
hand
and
vesta
coming
to
his
aid
his
long
lean
fingers
closed
around
hers
and
he
signalled
to
william
tilghman
with
his
eyes
the
bishop
came
near
and
by
a
painful
effort
milburn
put
his
hand
in
her
cousin
his
lips
framed
a
word
without
a
sound
glory
to
god
suddenly
exclaimed
grandmother
tilghman
who
seemed
to
see
without
sight
all
that
was
going
on
i
knew
it
would
be
so
if
both
would
wait
sighed
rhoda
to
her
husband
through
her
tears
there
was
still
something
on
milburn
mind
though
he
was
unable
to
explain
it
every
attempt
was
made
to
interpret
his
want
but
in
vain
till
aunt
hominy
broke
the
silence
by
mumbling
he
want
dat
debbil
hat
vesta
saw
her
husband
eyes
twinkle
as
if
he
had
heard
the
word
and
it
gave
her
a
thought
she
left
the
room
and
returned
with
her
boy
a
fine
young
fellow
obedient
to
her
wish
in
his
hand
was
his
father
hat
what
will
you
do
if

custis
vesta
spoke
loudly
so
that
the
dying
man
could
hear
i
will
wear
my
forefather
hat
papa
said
the
child
the
dying
man
drooped
his
eyes
as
if
to
say
no
and
looked
fervently
at
his
son
and
wearily
at
the
old
headpiece
vesta
placed
it
on
his
pillow
and
waited
to
know
his
next
wish
he
made
a
sign
which
they
interpreted
to
mean
lift
me
he
was
lifted
up
livid
as
the
dead
and
raised
his
eyes
towards
his
forehead
his
wife
set
the
entailed
hat
upon
his
temples
bury
it
he
said
in
a
distinct
whisper
and
passed
away
the
end
footnotes
in
the
original
manuscript
a
circumstantial
story
as
taken
from
milburn
lips
was
preserved
the
tales
of
a
hat
may
be
separately
published
slavery
in
the
state
of
delaware
never
had
any
recognition
it
existed
in
the
colonial
period
by
custom
as
over
the
whole
country
but
subject
to
be
regulated
or
abolished
by
simple
legislative
enactment
very
early
the
state
of
delaware
undertook
its
regulation
with
the
view
of
securing
the
personal
and
individual
rights
of
the
persons
so
held
in
bondage
and
to
prevent
the
increase
by
importation
in
the
export
of
delaware
slaves
was
forbidden
to
the
carolinas
georgia
and
the
west
indies
and
two
years
later
the
prohibition
was
extended
to
maryland
and
virginia
and
it
never
was
repealed
and
in
the
first
penalties
were
enacted
against
kidnappers
of
hon
smithers
to
the
the
skull
of
ebenezer
johnson
can
be
seen
at
fowler
wells
museum
new
york
with
the
through
it
there
also
are
the
skulls
of
patty
and
betty
cannon
at
this
point
the
second
episode
telling
the
descent
of
the
entailed
hat
from
raleigh
to
anne
hutchinson
is
omitted
to
shorten
the
book
frederick
douglass
afterwards
marshal
of
the
district
of
columbia
was
at
this
time
a
slave
boy
twelve
years
old
living
about
twenty
miles
from
the
scene
of
this
conversation
the
nat
turner
insurrection
in
virginia
occurred
a
year
or
thereabout
later
than
this
time
the
origin
of
patty
cannon
is
in
doubt
a
pamphlet
published
near
her
time
gives
it
as
above
with
strong
circumstantial
embellishments
yet
there
are
neighbors
who
say
she
was
of
delaware
and
maryland
stock
a
baker
and
a
moore
the
weight
of
tradition
is
the
other
way
this
incident
is
fully
