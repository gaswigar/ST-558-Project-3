to

and

is
not

preface
this
book
is
intended
as
a
sequel
to
and
character
it
might
indeed
have
appeared
as
an
introduction
to
these
volumes
for
thrift
is
the
basis
of
and
the
foundation
of
much
that
is
excellent
in
character
the
author
has
already
referred
to
the
use
and
abuse
of
money
but
the
lesson
is
worthy
of
being
repeated
and
enforced
as
he
has
already
observed
some
of
the
finest
qualities
of
human
nature
are
intimately
related
to
the
right
use
of
money
such
as
generosity
honesty
justice
and
as
well
as
the
practical
virtues
of
economy
and
providence
on
the
other
hand
there
are
their
counterparts
of
avarice
fraud
injustice
and
selfishness
as
displayed
by
the
inordinate
lovers
of
gain
and
the
vices
of
thoughtlessness
extravagance
and
improvidence
on
the
part
of
those
who
misuse
and
abuse
the
means
entrusted
to
them
sir
henry
taylor
has
observed
that
industry
must
take
an
interest
in
its
own
fruits
and
god
has
appointed
that
the
mass
of
mankind
shall
be
moved
by
this
interest
and
have
their
daily
labour
sweetened
by
it
the
earnings
and
savings
of
industry
should
be
intelligent
for
a
purpose
beyond
mere
earnings
and
savings
we
do
not
work
and
strive
for
ourselves
alone
but
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
dependent
upon
us
industry
must
know
how
to
earn
how
to
spend
and
how
to
save
the
man
who
knows
like
paul
how
to
spare
and
how
to
abound
has
a
great
knowledge
every
man
is
bound
to
do
what
he
can
to
elevate
his
social
state
and
to
secure
his
independence
for
this
purpose
he
must
spare
from
his
means
in
order
to
be
independent
in
his
condition
industry
enables
men
to
earn
their
living
it
should
also
enable
them
to
learn
to
live
independence
can
only
be
established
by
the
exercise
of
forethought
prudence
frugality
and
to
be
just
as
well
as
generous
men
must
deny
themselves
the
essence
of
generosity
is
the
object
of
this
book
is
to
induce
men
to
employ
their
means
for
worthy
purposes
and
not
to
waste
them
upon
selfish
indulgences
many
enemies
have
to
be
encountered
in
accomplishing
this
object
there
are
idleness
thoughtlessness
vanity
vice
intemperance
the
last
is
the
worst
enemy
of
all
numerous
cases
are
cited
in
the
course
of
the
following
book
which
show
that
one
of
the
best
methods
of
abating
the
curse
of
drink
is
to
induce
old
and
young
to
practise
the
virtue
of
thrift
much
of
this
book
was
written
and
some
of
it
published
years
ago
but
an
attack
of
paralysis
which
compelled
the
author
to
give
up
writing
for
some
time
has
delayed
its
appearance
until
now
for

a
fable
a
grasshopper
half
starved
with
cold
and
hunger
came
to
a
beehive
at
the
approach
of
winter
and
humbly
begged
the
bees
to
relieve
his
wants
with
a
few
drops
of
honey
one
of
the
bees
asked
him
how
he
had
spent
his
time
all
the
summer
and
why
he
had
not
laid
up
a
store
of
food
like
them
truly
said
he
i
spent
my
time
very
merrily
in
drinking
dancing
and
singing
and
never
once
thought
of
winter
our
plan
is
very
different
said
the
bee
we
work
hard
in
the
summer
to
lay
by
a
store
of
food
against
the
season
when
we
foresee
we
shall
want
it
but
those
who
do
nothing
but
drink
and
dance
and
sing
in
the
summer
must
expect
to
starve
in
the
winter
thrift
chapter
i
industry
not
what
i
have
but
what
i
do
is
my
productive
industry
is
the
only
capital
which
enriches
a
people
and
spreads
national
prosperity
and
in
all
labour
there
is
profit
says
solomon
what
is
the
science
of
political
economy
but
a
dull
sermon
on
this
text
god
provides
the
good
things
of
the
world
to
serve
the
needs
of
nature
by
the
labours
of
the
ploughman
the
skill
and
pains
of
the
artizan
and
the
dangers
and
traffic
of
the
merchant
the
idle
person
is
like
one
that
is
dead
unconcerned
in
the
changes
and
necessities
of
the
world
and
he
only
lives
to
spend
his
time
and
eat
the
fruits
of
the
earth
like
a
vermin
or
a
wolf
when
their
time
comes
they
die
and
perish
and
in
the
meantime
do
no
good
for
the
structure
that
we
raise
time
is
with
materials
filled
our
and
yesterdays
are
the
blocks
with
which
we
thrift
began
with
civilization
it
began
when
men
found
it
necessary
to
provide
for
as
well
as
for
it
began
long
before
money
was
invented
thrift
means
private
economy
it
includes
domestic
economy
as
well
as
the
order
and
management
of
a
family
while
it
is
the
object
of
private
economy
to
create
and
promote
the
of
individuals
it
is
the
object
of
political
economy
to
create
and
increase
the
wealth
of
nations
private
and
public
wealth
have
the
same
origin
wealth
is
obtained
by
labour
it
is
preserved
by
savings
and
accumulations
and
it
is
increased
by
diligence
and
perseverance
it
is
the
savings
of
individuals
which
compose
the
wealth
in
other
words
the
of
every
nation
on
the
other
hand
it
is
the
wastefulness
of
individuals
which
occasions
the
impoverishment
of
states
so
that
every
thrifty
person
may
be
regarded
as
a
public
benefactor
and
every
thriftless
person
as
a
public
enemy
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
necessity
for
private
economy
everybody
admits
it
and
recommends
it
but
with
respect
to
political
economy
there
are
numerous
discussions
for
instance
as
to
the
distribution
of
capital
the
accumulations
of
property
the
incidence
of
taxation
the
poor
laws
and
other
subjects
into
which
we
do
not
propose
to
enter
the
subject
of
private
economy
of
thrift
is
quite
sufficient
by
itself
to
occupy
the
pages
of
this
book
economy
is
not
a
natural
instinct
but
the
growth
of
experience
example
and
forethought
it
is
also
the
result
of
education
and
intelligence
it
is
only
when
men
become
wise
and
thoughtful
that
they
become
frugal
hence
the
best
means
of
making
men
and
women
provident
is
to
make
them
wise
prodigality
is
much
more
natural
to
man
than
thrift
the
savage
is
the
greatest
of
spendthrifts
for
he
has
no
forethought
no
the
prehistoric
man
saved
nothing
he
lived
in
caves
or
in
hollows
of
the
ground
covered
with
branches
he
subsisted
on
shellfish
which
he
picked
up
on
the
seashore
or
upon
hips
and
haws
which
he
gathered
in
the
woods
he
killed
animals
with
stones
he
lay
in
wait
for
them
or
ran
them
down
on
foot
then
he
learnt
to
use
stones
as
tools
making
stone
and
thereby
utilizing
his
labour
and
killing
birds
and
animals
more
quickly
the
original
savage
knew
nothing
of
agriculture
it
was
only
in
comparatively
recent
times
that
men
gathered
seeds
for
food
and
saved
a
portion
of
them
for
next
year
crop
when
minerals
were
discovered
and
fire
was
applied
to
them
and
the
minerals
were
smelted
into
metal
man
made
an
immense
stride
he
could
then
fabricate
hard
tools
chisel
stone
build
houses
and
proceed
by
unwearying
industry
to
devise
the
manifold
means
and
agencies
of
civilization
the
dweller
by
the
ocean
burnt
a
hollow
in
a
felled
tree
launched
it
went
to
sea
in
it
and
fished
for
food
the
hollowed
tree
became
a
boat
held
together
with
iron
nails
the
boat
became
a
galley
a
ship
a
a
screw
steamer
and
the
world
was
opened
up
for
colonization
and
civilization
man
would
have
continued
uncivilized
but
for
the
results
of
the
useful
labours
of
those
who
preceded
him
the
soil
was
reclaimed
by
his
predecessors
and
made
to
grow
food
for
human
uses
they
invented
tools
and
fabrics
and
we
reap
the
useful
results
they
discovered
art
and
science
and
we
succeed
to
the
useful
effects
of
their
labours
all
nature
teaches
that
no
good
thing
which
has
once
been
done
passes
utterly
away
the
living
are
ever
reminded
of
the
buried
millions
who
have
worked
and
won
before
them
the
handicraft
and
skill
displayed
in
the
buildings
and
sculptures
of
the
cities
of
nineveh
babylon
and
troy
have
descended
to
the
present
time
in
economy
no
human
labour
is
altogether
lost
some
remnant
of
useful
effect
continues
to
reward
the
race
if
not
the
individual
the
mere
material
wealth
bequeathed
to
us
by
our
forefathers
forms
but
an
insignificant
item
in
the
sum
of
our
inheritance
our
birthright
is
made
up
of
something
far
more
imperishable
it
consists
of
the
sum
of
the
useful
effects
of
human
skill
and
labour
these
effects
were
not
transmitted
by
learning
but
by
teaching
and
example
one
generation
taught
another
and
thus
art
and
handicraft
the
knowledge
of
mechanical
appliances
and

continued
to
be
preserved
the
labours
and
efforts
of
former
generations
were
thus
transmitted
by
father
to

and
they
continue
to
form
the
natural
heritage
of
the
human
race
one
of
the
most
important
instruments
of
civilization
our
birthright
therefore
consists
in
the
useful
effects
of
the
labours
of
our
forefathers
but
we
can
not
enjoy
them
unless
we
ourselves
take
part
in
the
work
all
must
labour
either
with
hand
or
head
without
work
life
is
worthless
it
becomes
a
mere
state
of
moral
coma
we
do
not
mean
merely
physical
work
there
is
a
great
deal
of
higher
work
the
work
of
action
and
endurance
of
trial
and
patience
of
enterprise
and
philanthropy
of
spreading
truth
and
civilization
of
diminishing
suffering
and
relieving
the

helping
the
weak

enabling

to

themselves

to

labours
like
a
vermin
to
filch
its
food
out
of

granary
or
like

it

rather
outdo
his

obligations
to

care
and
toil
by
considerable
service
and
beneficence
to
the
public
for
there
is
no
calling
of
any
sort
from
the
sceptre
to
the
spade
the
management
whereof
with
any
good
success
any
credit
any
satisfaction
doth
not
demand
much
work
of
the
head
or
of
the
hands
or
of
both
labour
is
not
only
a
necessity
but
it
is
also
a
pleasure
what
would
otherwise
be
a
curse
by
the
constitution
of
our
physical
system
becomes
a
blessing
our
life
is
a
conflict
with
nature
in
some
respects
but
it
is
also
a
with
nature
in
others
the
sun
the
air
and
the
earth
are
constantly
abstracting
from
us
our
vital
forces
hence
we
eat
and
drink
for
nourishment
and
clothe
ourselves
for
warmth
nature
works
with
us
she
provides
the
earth
which
we
furrow
she
grows
and
ripens
the
seeds
that
we
sow
and
gather
she
furnishes
with
the
help
of
human
labour
the
wool
that
we
spin
and
the
food
that
we
eat
and
it
ought
never
to
be
forgotten
that
however
rich
or
poor
we
may
be
all
that
we
eat
all
that
we
are
clothed
with
all
that
shelters
us
from
the
palace
to
the
cottage
is
the
result
of
labour
men
with
each
other
for
the
mutual
sustenance
of
all
the
husbandman

the

the

in

numbers
of

to
create
the
general
result
labour

applied
to
the
vulgarest
things
invest
them
at

with
precious

labour
is
indeed
the
life
of
humanity
take
it

banish
it
and
the

of
adam
were
at

stricken
with
death
he
that

said
paul
neither
shall
he

and
the
apostle
glorified
himself
in
that
he
had
laboured
with
his
own
hands
and
had
not
been
chargeable
to
any
man
there
is
a
story
of
an
old
farmer
calling
his
three
idle
sons
around
him
when
on
his
deathbed
to
impart
to
them
an
important
secret
my
sons
said
he
a
great
treasure
lies
hid
in
the
estate
which
i
am
about
to
leave
to
you
the
old
man
gasped
where
is
it
hid
exclaimed
the
sons
in
a
breath
i
am
about
to
tell
you
said
the
old
man
you
will
have
to
dig
for
it
but
his
breath
failed
him
before
he
could
impart
the
weighty
secret
and
he
died
forthwith
the
sons
set
to
work
with
spade
and
mattock
upon
the
long
neglected
fields
and
they
turned
up
every
sod
and
clod
upon
the
estate
they
discovered
no
treasure
but
they
learnt
to
work
and
when
fields
were
sown
and
the
harvests
came
lo
the
yield
was
prodigious
in
consequence
of
the
thorough
tillage
which
they
had
undergone
then
it
was
that
they
discovered
the
treasure
concealed
in
the
estate
of
which
their
wise
old
father
had
advised
them
labour
is
at
once
a
burden
a
chastisement
an
honour
and
a
pleasure
it
may
be
identified
with
poverty
but
there
is
also
glory
in
it
it
bears
witness
at
the
same
time
to
our
natural
wants
and
to
our
manifold
needs
what
were
man
what
were
life
what
were
civilization
without
labour
all
that
is
great
in
man
comes
of
labour
greatness
in
art
in
literature
in
science
knowledge
the
wing
wherewith
we
fly
to
heaven
is
only
acquired
through
labour
genius
is
but
a
capability
of
labouring
intensely
it
is
the
power
of
making
great
and
sustained
efforts
labour
may
be
a
chastisement
but
it
is
indeed
a
glorious
one
it
is
worship
duty
praise
and
immortality
for
those
who
labour
with
the
highest
aims
and
for
the
purest
purposes
there
are
many
who
murmur
and
complain
at
the
law
of
labour
under
which
we
live
without
reflecting
that
obedience
to
it
is
not
only
in
conformity
with
the
divine
will
but
also
necessary
for
the
development
of
intelligence
and
for
the
thorough
enjoyment
of
our
common
nature
of
all
wretched
men
surely
the
idle
are
the
most
so
those
whose
life
is
barren
of
utility
who
have
nothing
to
do
except
to
gratify
their
senses
are
not
such
men
the
most
querulous
miserable
and
dissatisfied
of
all
constantly
in
a
state
of
alike
useless
to
themselves
and
to
others
mere
cumberers
of
the
earth
who
when
removed
are
missed
by
none
and
whom
none
regret
most
wretched
and
ignoble
lot
indeed
is
the
lot
of
the
idlers
who
have
helped
the
world
onward
so
much
as
the
workers
men
who
have
had
to
work
for
necessity
or
from
choice
all
that
we
call
progress
civilization
and
prosperity
depends
upon
industry
diligently
applied
from
the
culture
of
a
to
the
construction
of
a
steamship
from
the
stitching
of
a
collar
to
the
sculpturing
of
the
statue
that
enchants
the
world
all
useful
and
beautiful
thoughts
in
like
manner
are
the
issue
of
labour
of
study
of
observation
of
research
of
diligent
elaboration
the
noblest
poem
can
not
be
elaborated
and
send
down
its
undying
strains
into
the
future
without
steady
and
painstaking
labour
no
great
work
has
ever
been
done
at
a
heat
it
is
the
result
of
repeated
efforts
and
often
of
many
failures
one
generation
begins
and
another
continues
the
present
with
the
past
thus
the
parthenon
began
with
a
the
last
judgment
with
a
few
scratches
on
the
sand
it
is
the
same
with
individuals
of
the
race
they
begin
with
abortive
efforts
which
by
means
of
perseverance
lead
to
successful
issues
the
history
of
industry
is
uniform
in
the
character
of
its
illustrations
industry
enables
the
poorest
man
to
achieve
honour
if
not
distinction
the
greatest
names
in
the
history
of

are
those
of
labouring
men
a

working

of
all

have
one
after

added
to
the
triumphs
of
mechanical
skill
by
the
working
man
we
do
not
mean
merely
the
man
who
labours
with
his
muscles
and
sinews
a
horse
can
do
this
but
is
the
working
man
who
works
with
his
brain
also
and
whose
whole
physical
system
is
under
the
influence
of
his
higher
faculties
the
man
who
paints
a
picture
who
writes
a
book
who
makes
a
law
who
creates
a
poem
is
a
working
man
of
the
highest
order
not
so
necessary
to
the
physical
sustainment
of
the
community
as
the
ploughman
or
the
shepherd
but
not
less
important
as
providing
for
society
its
highest
intellectual
nourishment
having
said
so
much
of
the
importance
and
the
necessity
of
industry
let
us
see
what
uses
are
made
of
the
advantages
derivable
from
it
it
is
clear
that
man
would
have
continued
uncivilized
but
for
the
accumulations
of
savings
made
by
his
forefathers
the
savings
of
skill
of
art
of
invention
and
of
intellectual
culture
it
is
the
savings
of
the
world
that
have
made
the
civilization
of
the
world
savings
are
the
result
of
labour
and
it
is
only
when
labourers
begin
to
save
that
the
results
of
civilization
accumulate
we
have
said
that
thrift
began
with
civilization
we
might
almost
have
said
that
thrift
produced
civilization
thrift
produces
capital
and
capital
is
the
conserved
result
of
labour
the
capitalist
is
merely
a
man
who
does
not
spend
all
that
is
earned
by
work
but
thrift
is
not
a
natural
instinct
it
is
an
acquired
principle
of
conduct
it
involves
the
denial
of
present
enjoyment
for
future
good
the
subordination
of
animal
appetite
to
reason
forethought
and
prudence
it
works
for
but
also
provides
for
it
invests
the
capital
it
has
saved
and
makes
provision
for
the
future
man
right
of
seeing
the
future
says
edward
denison
which
is
conferred
on
him
by
reason
has
attached
to
it
the
duty
of
providing
for
that
future
and
our
language
bears
witness
to
this
truth
by
using
as
expressive
of
active
precaution
against
future
want
a
word
which
in
its
radical
meaning
implies
only
a
passive
foreknowledge
of
the
same
whenever
we
speak
of
the
of
we
assume
that
forewarned
is
to
know
the
future
is
no
virtue
but
it
is
the
greatest
of
virtues
to
prepare
for
it
footnote

the
late
edward
p
but
a
large
proportion
of
men
do
not
provide
for
the

they
do
not
remember
the
past
they
think
only
of
the
present
they
preserve
nothing
they
spend
all
that
they

they
do
not

they
do

their

they
may
make

but
eat
and

the
whole
of
what
they
earn
such
people
are
constantly
poor
and
hanging
on
the
verge
of
destitution
it
is
the
same
with
nations
the
nations
which
consume
all
that
they
produce
without
leaving
a

for

production
have
no

like
thriftless
individuals
they
live
from

and
are
always
poor
and
miserable
nations
that
have
no

have
no

they

hence
they

eugene

and
its
pp
it
is
in
this
way
that
society
mainly
consists
of
two
classes
the
savers
and
the
wasters
the
provident
and
the
improvident
the
thrifty
and
the
thriftless
the
haves
and
the
the
men
who
economize
by
means
of
labour
become
the
owners
of
capital
which
sets
other
labour
in
motion
capital
accumulates
in
their
hands
and
they
employ
other
labourers
to
work
for
them
thus
trade
and
commerce
begin
the

build
houses
warehouses
and
mills
they
fit
manufactories
with
tools
and
machines
they
build
ships
and
send
them
to
various
parts
of
the
world
they
put
their
capital
together
and
build
railroads
harbours
and
docks
they
open
up
mines
of
coal
iron
and
copper
and
erect
pumping
engines
to
keep
them
clear
of

they
employ
labourers
to
work
the
mines
and
thus
give
rise
to
an
immense
amount
of
employment
all
this
is
the
result
of
thrift
it
is
the
result
of
economizing
money
and
employing
it
for
beneficial
purposes
the

man
has
no

by

that
they

society
at

suffers
far
more
from
waste

than
from

of

it
is
easier
to
make

than
to
know
how
to
spend
it
it
is
not
what
a
man
gets
that
constitutes
his

but
his
manner
of
spending
and
economizing
and
when
a
man
obtains
by
his
labour
more
than
enough
for
his
personal
and
family
wants
and
can
lay
by
a
little
store
of
savings
besides
he
unquestionably
possesses
the
elements
of
social
the
savings
may
amount
to
little
but
they
may
be
sufficient
to
make
him
independent
there
is
no
reason
why
the
workman
of
may
not
save
a
store
of
capital
it
is
merely
a
matter
of
and
private
economy
indeed
the
principal
industrial
leaders
of
consist
for
the
most
part
of
men
who
have
sprung
directly
from
the
ranks
it
is
the
accumulation
of
experience
and
skill
that
makes
the
difference
between
the
workman
and
the
and
it
depends
upon
the
workman
himself
whether
he
will
save
his
capital
or
waste
it
if
he
save
it
he
will
always
find
that
he
has
sufficient
opportunities
for
employing
it
profitably
and
usefully
when
i
was
down
in
lancashire
the
other
day
said
cobden
to
his
at
midhurst
i
visited
a
mill
in
company
with
some
other
gentlemen
and
that
mill
belonged
to
a
person
whose
real
name
i
will
not
mention
but
whom
for
the
present
purpose
i
will
call
smith
there
could
not
have
been
less
than
three
or
four
thousand
persons
engaged
in
this
mill
when
it
was
at
work
and
there
were
seven
hundred
under
one
roof
as
we
were
coming
away
one
of
the
friends
who
accompanied
me
patted
the
owner
of
the
mill
on
the
shoulder
and
with
that
frank
and
manly
familiarity
which
rather
distinguishes
the
lancashire
race
he
said
smith
was
a
working
man
himself
years
ago
and
he
owes
all
this
entirely
to
his
own
industry
and
frugality
to
which
smith
immediately
replied
in
the
same
frank
and
manner
i
do
not
owe
it
all
to
myself
i
married
a
wife
with
a
fortune
for
she
was
earning
a
week
as
a
weaver

the
when
she
married

franklin
said
time
is
gold
if
one
wishes
to
earn
money
it
may
be
done
by
the
proper
use
of
time
but
time
may
also
be
spent
in
doing
many
good
and
noble
actions
it
may
be
spent
in
learning
in
study
in
art
in
science
in
literature
time
can
be
economized
by
system
system
is
an
arrangement
to
secure
certain
ends
so
that
no
time
may
be
lost
in
accomplishing
them
every
business
man
must
be
systematic
and
orderly
so
must
every
housewife
there
must
be
a
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
place
there
must
also
be
a
time
for
everything
and
everything
must
be
done
in
time
it
is
not
necessary
to
show
that
economy
is
useful
nobody
denies
that
thrift
may
be
practised
we
see
numerous
examples
of
it
what
many
men
have
already
done
all
other
men
do
nor
is
thrift
a
painful
virtue
on
the
contrary
it
enables
us
to
avoid
much
contempt
and
many
indignities
it
requires
us
to
deny
ourselves
but
not
to
abstain
from
any
proper
enjoyment
it
provides
many
honest
pleasures
of
which
thriftlessness
and
extravagance
deprive
us
let
no
man
say
that
he
can
not
economize
there
are
few
persons
who
could
not
contrive
to
save
a
few
shillings
weekly
in
twenty
years
three
shillings
saved
weekly
would
amount
to
two
hundred
and
forty
pounds
and
in
ten
years
more
by
addition
of
interest
to
four
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
some
may
say
that
they
can
not
save
nearly
so
much
well
begin
with
two
shillings
one
shilling
or
even
sixpence
begin
somewhere
but
at
all
events
make
a
beginning
sixpence
a
week
deposited
in
the
savings
bank
will
amount
to
forty
pounds
in
twenty
years
and
seventy
pounds
in
thirty
years
it
is
the
of
economizing
and
denying
oneself
that
needs
to
be
formed
thrift
does
not
require
superior
courage
nor
superior
intellect
nor
any
superhuman
virtue
it
merely
requires
common
sense
and
the
power
of
resisting
selfish
enjoyments
in
fact
thrift
is
merely
common
sense
in
working
action
it
needs
no
fervent
resolution
but
only
a
little
patient
begin
is
its
device
the
more
the
habit
of
thrift
is
practised
the
easier
it
becomes
and
the
sooner
it
compensates
the
for
the
sacrifices
which
it
has
imposed
the
question
may
be
asked
is
it
possible
for
a
man
working
for
small
wages
to
save
anything
and
lay
it
by
in
a
savings
bank
when
he
requires
every
penny
for
the
maintenance
of
his
family
but
the
fact
remains
that
it
done
by
many
industrious
and
sober
men
that
they
do
deny
themselves
and
put
their
spare
earnings
into
savings
banks
and
the
other
receptacles
provided
for
poor
men
savings
and
if
some
can
do
this
all
may
do
it
under
similar
circumstances
without
depriving
themselves
of
any
genuine
pleasure
or
any
real
enjoyment
how
intensely
selfish
is
it
for
a
person
in
the
receipt
of
good
pay
to
spend
everything
upon
himself
or
if
he
has
a
family
to
spend
his
whole
earnings
from
week
to
week
and
lay
nothing
by
when
we
hear
that
a
man
who
has
been
in
the
receipt
of
a
good
salary
has
died
and
left
nothing
behind
him
that
he
has
left
his
wife
and
family
destitute
left
them
to
chance
to
live
or
perish
anywhere
we
can
not
but
regard
it
as
the
most
selfish
thriftlessness
and
yet
comparatively
little
is
thought
of
such
cases
perhaps
the
hat
goes
round
subscriptions
may
produce
something
perhaps
nothing
and
the
ruined
remnants
of
the
unhappy
family
sink
into
poverty
and
destitution
yet
the
merest
prudence
would
to
a
great
extent
have
obviated
this
result
the
curtailment
of
any
sensual
and
selfish
enjoyment
of
a
glass
of
beer
or
a
screw
of
tobacco
would
enable
a
man
in
the
course
of
years
to
save
at
least
something
for
others
instead
of
wasting
it
on
himself
it
is
in
fact
the
absolute
duty
of
the
poorest
man
to
provide
in
however
slight
a
degree
for
the
support
of
himself
and
his
family
in
the
season
of
sickness
and
helplessness
which
often
comes
upon
men
when
they
least
expect
such
a
visitation
comparatively
few
people
can
be
rich
but
most
have
it
in
their
power
to
acquire
by
industry
and
economy
sufficient
to
meet
their
personal
wants
they
may
even
become
the
possessors
of
savings
sufficient
to
secure
them
against
penury
and
poverty
in
their
old
age
it
is
not
however
the
want
of
opportunity
but
the
want
of
will
that
stands
in
the
way
of
economy
men
may
labour
unceasingly
with
hand
or
head
but
they
can
not
abstain
from
spending
too
freely
and
living
too
highly
the
majority
prefer
the
enjoyment
of
pleasure
to
the
practice
of
with
the
mass
of
men
the
animal
is
paramount
they
often
spend
all
that
they
earn
but
it
is
not
merely
the
working
people
who
are
spendthrifts
we
hear
of
men
who
for
years
have
been
earning
and
spending
hundreds
a
year
who
suddenly
die
leaving
their
children
penniless
everybody
knows
of
such
cases
at
their
death
the
very
furniture
of
the
house
they
have
lived
in
belongs
to
others
it
is
sold
to
pay
their
funeral
expenses
and
debts
which
they
have
incurred
during
their
thriftless
lifetime
money
represents
a
multitude
of
objects
without
value
or
without
real
utility
but
it
also
represents
something
much
more
precious
and
that
is
independence
in
this
light
it
is
of
great
moral
importance
as
a
guarantee
of
independence
the
modest
and
plebeian
quality
of
economy
is
at
once
ennobled
and
raised
to
the
rank
of
one
of
the
most
meritorious
of
virtues
never
treat
money
affairs
with
levity
said
bulwer
money
is
character
some
of
man
best
qualities
depend
upon
the
right
use
of
money
such
as
his
generosity
benevolence
justice
honesty
and
forethought
many
of
his
worst
qualities
also
originate
in
the
bad
use
of
money
such
as
greed
miserliness
injustice
extravagance
and
improvidence
no
class
ever
accomplished
anything
that
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
people
who
spend
all
that
they
earn
are
ever
hanging
on
the
brink
of
destitution
they
must
necessarily
be
weak
and
impotent
the
slaves
of
time
and
circumstance
they
keep
themselves
poor
they
lose
as
well
as
the
respect
of
others
it
is
impossible
that
they
can
be
free
and
independent
to
be
thriftless
is
enough
to
deprive
one
of
all
manly
spirit
and
virtue
but
a
man
with
something
saved
no
matter
how
little
is
in
a
different
position
the
little
capital
he
has
stored
up
is
always
a
source
of
power
he
is
no
longer
the
sport
of
time
and
fate
he
can
boldly
look
the
world
in
the
face
he
is
in
a
manner
his
own
master
he
can
dictate
his
own
terms
he
can
neither
be
bought
nor
sold
he
can
look
forward
with
cheerfulness
to
an
old
age
of
comfort
and
happiness
as
men
become
wise
and
thoughtful
they
generally
become
provident
and
frugal
a
thoughtless
man
like
a
savage
spends
as
he
gets
thinking
nothing
of
of
the
time
of
adversity
or
of
the
claims
of
those
whom
he
has
made
dependent
on
him
but
a
wise
man
thinks
of
the
future
he
prepares
in
good
time
for
the
evil
day
that
may
come
upon
him
and
his
family
and
he
provides
carefully
for
those
who
are
near
and
dear
to
him
what
a
serious
responsibility
does
the
man
incur
who
marries
not
many
seriously
think
of
this
responsibility
perhaps
this
is
wisely
ordered
for
much
serious
thinking
might
end
in
the
avoidance
of
married
life
and
its
responsibilities
but
once
married
a
man
ought
forthwith
to
determine
that
so
far
as
his
own
efforts
are
concerned
want
shall
never
enter
his
household
and
that
his
children
shall
not
in
the
event
of
his
being
removed
from
the
scene
of
life
and
labour
be
left
a
burthen
upon
society
economy
with
this
object
is
an
important
duty
without
economy
no
man
can
be
just
no
man
can
be
honest
improvidence
is
cruelty
to
women
and
children
though
the
cruelty
is
born
of
ignorance
a
father
spends
his
surplus
means
in
drink
providing
little
and
saving
nothing
and
then
he
dies
leaving
his
destitute
family
his
lifelong
victims
can
any
form
of
cruelty
surpass
this
yet
this
reckless
course
is
pursued
to
a
large
extent
among
every
class
the
middle
and
upper
classes
are
equally
guilty
with
the
lower
class
they
live
beyond
their
means
they
live
extravagantly
they
are
ambitious
of
glare
and
glitter
frivolity
and
pleasure
they
struggle
to
be
rich
that
they
may
have
the
means
of
spending
of
drinking
rich
wines
and
giving
good
dinners
when
hume
said
in
the
house
of
commons
some
years
ago
that
the
tone
of
living
in
england
was
altogether
too
high
his
observation
was
followed
with
loud
laughter
yet
his
remark
was
perfectly
true
it
is
far
more
true
now
than
it
was
then
thinking
people
believe
that
life
is
now
too
fast
and
that
we
are
living
at
in
short
we
live
extravagantly
we
live
beyond
our
means
we
throw
away
oar
earnings
and
often
throw
our
lives
after
them
many
persons
are
diligent
enough
in
making
money
but
do
not
know
how
to
economize
it
or
how
to
spend
it
they
have
sufficient
skill
and
industry
to
do
the
one
but
they
want
the
necessary
wisdom
to
do
the
other
the
temporary
passion
for
enjoyment
seizes
us
and
we
give
way
to
it
without
regard
to
consequences
and
yet
it
may
be
merely
the
result
of
forgetfulness
and
might
be
easily
controlled
by
firmness
of
will
and
by
energetic
resolution
to
avoid
the
occasional
causes
of
expenditure
for
the
future
the
habit
of
saving
arises
for
the
most
part
in
the
desire
to
ameliorate
our
social
condition
as
well
as
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
those
who
are
dependent
upon
us
it
dispenses
with
everything
which
is
not
essential
and
avoids
all
methods
of
living
that
are
wasteful
and
extravagant
a
purchase
made
at
the
lowest
price
will
be
dear
if
it
be
a
superfluity
little
expenses
lead
to
great
buying
things
that
are
not
wanted
soon
accustoms
us
to
prodigality
in
other
respects
cicero
said
not
to
have
a
mania
for
buying
is
to
possess
a
revenue
many
are
carried
away
by
the
habit
of
here
is
something
wonderfully
cheap
let
us
buy
it
have
you
any
use
for
it
no
not
at
present
but
it
is
sure
to
come
in
useful
some
time
fashion
runs
in
this
habit
of
buying
some
buy
old
china
as
much
as
will
furnish
a
others
buy
old
pictures
old
furniture
old
wines
all
great
bargains
there
would
be
little
harm
in
buying
these
old
things
if
they
were
not
so
often
bought
at
the
expense
of
the
creditors
horace
walpole
once
said
i
hope
that
there
will
not
be
another
sale
for
i
have
not
an
inch
of
room
nor
a
farthing
left
men
must
prepare
in
youth
and
in
middle
age
the
means
of
enjoying
old
age
pleasantly
and
happily
there
can
be
nothing
more
distressing
than
to
see
an
old
man
who
has
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
life
in
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
begging
for
bread
and
relying
entirely
on
the
commiseration
of
his
neighbours
or
upon
the
bounty
of
strangers
such
a
consideration
as
this
should
inspire
men
in
early
life
with
a
determination
to
work
and
to
save
for
the
benefit
of
themselves
and
their
families
in
later
years
it
is
in
fact
in
youth
that
economy
should
be
practised
and
in
old
age
that
men
should
dispense
liberally
provided
they
do
not
exceed
their
income
the
young
man
has
a
long
future
before
him
during
which
he
may
exercise
the
principles
of
economy
whilst
the
other
is
reaching
the
end
of
his
career
and
can
carry
nothing
out
of
the
world
with
him
this
however
is
not
the
usual
practice
the
young
man
now
spends
or
desires
to
spend
quite
as
liberally
and
often
much
more
liberally
than
his
father
who
is
about
to
end
his
career
he
begins
life
where
his
father
left
off
he
spends
more
than
his
father
did
at
his
age
and
soon
finds
himself
up
to
his
ears
in
debt
to
satisfy
his
incessant
wants
he
resorts
to
unscrupulous
means
and
to
illicit
gains
he
tries
to
make
money
rapidly
he
speculates
and
is
speedily
wound
up
thus
he
obtains
experience
but
it
is
the
result
not
of
but
of
socrates
recommends
fathers
of
families
to
observe
the
practice
of
their
thrifty
neighbours
of
those
who
spend
their
means
to
the
best
advantage
and
to
profit
by
their
example
thrift
is
essentially
practical
and
can
best
be
taught
by
facts
two
men
earn
say
five
shillings
a
day
they
are
in
precisely
the
same
condition
as
respects
family
living
and
expenditure
yet
the
one
says
he
can
not
save
and
does
not
while
the
other
says
he
can
save
and
regularly
deposits
part
of
his
savings
in
a
savings
bank
and
eventually
becomes
a
capitalist
samuel
johnson
fully
knew
the
straits
of
poverty
he
once
signed
his
name
or
he
had
walked
the
streets
with
savage
not
knowing
where
to
lay
his
head
at
night
johnson
never
forgot
the
poverty
through
which
he
passed
in
his
early
life
and
he
was
always
counselling
his
friends
and
readers
to
avoid
it
like
cicero
he
averred
that
the
best
source
of
wealth
or
was
economy
he
called
it
the
daughter
of
prudence
the
sister
of
temperance
and
the
mother
of
liberty
his
mind
his
character
originating
in
instigates
the
first
step
of
improvement
it
stimulates
a
man
to
rise
to
look
upward
to
develop
his
intelligence
to
improve
his
condition
is
the
root
of
most
of
the
virtues
of
cleanliness
chastity
reverence
honesty
sobriety
to
think
meanly
of
one
self
is
to
sink
sometimes
to
descend
a
precipice
at
the
bottom
of
which
is
infamy
every
man
can
help
himself
to
some
extent
we
are
not
mere
straws
thrown
upon
the
current
to
mark
its
course
but
possessed
of
freedom
of
action
endowed
with
power
to
stem
the
waves
and
rise
above
them
each
marking
out
a
course
for
himself
we
can
each
elevate
ourselves
in
the
scale
of
moral
being
we
can
cherish
pure
thoughts
we
can
perform
good
actions
we
can
live
soberly
and
frugally
we
can
provide
against
the
evil
day
we
can
read
good
books
listen
to
wise
teachers
and
place
ourselves
under
the
divinest
influences
on
earth
we
can
live
for
the
highest
purposes
and
with
the
highest
aims
in
view
and
social
are
the
same
says
one
of
our
poets
the
man
who
improves
himself
improves
the
world
he
adds
one
more
true
man
to
the
mass
and
the
mass
being
made
up
of
individuals
it
is
clear
that
were
each
to
improve
himself
the
result
would
be
the
improvement
of
the
whole
social
advancement
is
the
consequence
of
individual
advancement
the
whole
can
not
be
pure
unless
the
individuals
composing
it
are
pure
society
at
large
is
but
the
reflex
of
individual
conditions
all
this
is
but
the
repetition
of
a
truism
but
truisms
have
often
to
be
repeated
to
make
their
full
impression
then
again
a
man
when
he
has
improved
himself
is
better
able
to
improve
those
who
are
brought
into
contact
with
him
he
has
more
power
his
sphere
of
vision
is
enlarged
he
sees
more
clearly
the
defects
in
the
condition
of
others
that
might
be
remedied
he
can
lend
a
more
active
helping
hand
to
raise
them
he
has
done
his
duty
by
himself
and
can
with
more
authority
urge
upon
others
the
necessity
of
doing
the
like
duty
to
themselves
how
can
a
man
be
a
social
elevator
who
is
himself
walking
in
the
mire
of
how
can
he
teach
sobriety
or
cleanliness
if
he
be
himself
drunken
or
foul
physician
heal
thyself
is
the
answer
of
his
neighbours
the
sum
and
substance
of
our
remarks
is
this
in
all
the
individual
reforms
or
improvements
that
we
desire
we
must
begin
with
ourselves
we
must
exhibit
our
gospel
in
our
own
life
we
must
teach
by
our
own
example
if
we
would
have
others
elevated
we
must
elevate
ourselves
each
man
can
exhibit
the
results
in
his
own
person
he
can
begin
with
the
uncertainty
of
life
is
a
strong
inducement
to
provide
against
the
evil
day
to
do
this
is
a
moral
and
social
as
well
as
a
religious
duty
he
that
provideth
not
for
his
own
and
especially
for
those
of
his
own
household
hath
denied
the
faith
and
is
worse
than
an
infidel
the
uncertainty
of
life
is
proverbially
true
the
strongest
and
healthiest
man
may
be
stricken
down
in
a
moment
by
accident
or
disease
if
we
take
human
life
in
the
mass
we
can
not
fail
to
recognize
the
uncertainty
of
life
as
much
as
we
do
the
certainty
of
death
there
is
a
striking
passage
in
addison
vision
of
mirza
in
which
life
is
pictured
as
a
passage
over
a
bridge
of
about
a
hundred
arches
a
black
cloud
hangs
over
each
end
of
the
bridge
at
the
entrance
to
it
there
are
hidden
pitfalls
very
thickly
set
through
which
throngs
disappear
so
soon
as
they
have
placed
their
feet
upon
the
bridge
they
grow
thinner
towards
the
centre
they
gradually
disappear
until
at
length
only
a
few
persons
reach
the
further
side
and
these
also
having
dropped
through
the
pitfalls
the
bridge
at
its
further
extremity
becomes
entirely
clear
the
description
of
addison
corresponds
with
the
results
of
the
observations
made
as
to
the
duration
of
human
life
thus
of
a
hundred
thousand
persons
born
in
this
country
it
has
been
ascertained
that
a
fourth
of
them
die
before
they
have
reached
their
fifth
year
and
before
they
have
reached
their
fiftieth
year
one
thousand
one
hundred
will
reach
their
ninetieth
year
sixteen
will
live
to
a
hundred
and
only
two
persons
out
of
the
hundred
thousand
like
the
last
barks
of
an
innumerable
convoy
will
reach
the
advanced
and
helpless
age
of
a
hundred
and
five
years
two
things
are
very
obvious
the
uncertainty
as
to
the
hour
of
death
in
individuals
but
the
regularity
and
constancy
of
the
circumstances
which
influence
the
duration
of
human
life
in
the
aggregate
it
is
a
matter
of
certainty
that
the
life
of
all
persons
born
in
this
country
extends
to
about
years
this
has
been
proved
by
a
very
large
number
of
observations
of
human
life
and
its
duration
equally
extensive
observations
have
been
made
as
to
the
average
number
of
persons
of
various
ages
who
die
yearly
it
is
always
the
number
of
the
experiments
which
gives
the
law
of
the
probability
it
is
on
such
observations
that
the
actuary
founds
his
estimates
of
the
mortality
that
exists
at
any
given
period
of
life
the
actuary
tells
you
that
he
has
been
guided
by
the
laws
of
mortality
now
the
results
must
be
very
regular
to
justify
the
actuary
in
speaking
of
mortality
as
governed
by
laws
and
yet
it
is
so
indeed
there
would
seem
to
be
no
such
thing
as
chance
in
the
world
man
lives
and
dies
in
conformity
to
a
law
a
sparrow
falls
to
the
ground
in
obedience
to
a
law
nay
there
are
matters
in
the
ordinary
transactions
of
life
such
as
one
might
suppose
were
the
mere
result
of
chance
which
are
ascertained
to
be
of
remarkable
accuracy
when
taken
in
the
mass
for
instance
the
number
of
letters
put
in
the
without
an
address
the
number
of
letters
wrongly
directed
the
number
containing
money
the
number
unstamped
continue
nearly
the
same
in
relation
to
the
number
of
letters
posted
from
one
year
to
another
now
it
is
the
business
of
man
to
understand
the
laws
of
health
and
to
provide
against
their
consequences
as
for
instance
in
the
matter
of
sickness
accident
and
premature
death
we
can
not
escape
the
consequences
of
transgression
of
the
natural
laws
though
we
may
have
meant
well
we
must
have
done
well
the
creator
does
not
alter
his
laws
to
accommodate
them
to
our
ignorance
he
has
furnished
us
with
intelligence
so
that
we
may
understand
them
and
act
upon
them
otherwise
we
must
suffer
the
consequences
in
inevitable
pain
and
sorrow
we
often
hear
the
cry
raised
will
nobody
help
us
it
is
a
spiritless
hopeless
cry
it
is
sometimes
a
cry
of
revolting
meanness
especially
when
it
issues
from
those
who
with
a
little
sobriety
and
thrift
might
easily
help
themselves
many
people
have
yet
to
learn
that
virtue
knowledge
freedom
and
prosperity
must
spring
from
themselves
legislation
can
do
very
little
for
them
it
can
not
make
them
sober
intelligent
and
the
prime
miseries
of
most
men
have
their
origin
in
causes
far
removed
from
acts
of
parliament
the
spendthrift
laughs
at
legislation
the
drunkard
defies
it
and
arrogates
the
right
of
dispensing
with
forethought
and
throwing
upon
others
the
blame
of
his
ultimate
wretchedness
the
mob
orators
who
gather
the
millions
about
them
are
very
wide
of
the
mark
when
instead
of
seeking
to
train
their
crowd
of
hearers
to
habits
of
frugality
temperance
and
they
encourage
them
to
keep
up
the
cry
will
nobody
help
us
the
cry
sickens
the
soul
it
shows
gross
ignorance
of
the
first
elements
of
personal
welfare
help
is
in
men
themselves
they
were
born
to
help
and
to
elevate
themselves
they
must
work
out
their
own
salvation
the
poorest
men
have
done
it
why
should
not
every
man
do
it
the
brave
upward
spirit
ever
conquers
the
number
of
workmen
in
this
country
has
become
very
large
who
might
easily
save
and
economize
to
the
improvement
of
their
moral
of
their
respectability
and
independence
and
of
their
status
in
society
as
men
and
citizens
they
are
improvident
and
thriftless
to
an
extent
which
proves
not
less
hurtful
to
their
personal
happiness
and
domestic
comfort
than
it
is
injurious
to
the
society
of
which
they
form
so
important
a
part
in
prosperous
times
they
spend
their
gains
recklessly
and
when
adverse
times
come
they
are
at
once
plunged
in
misery
money
is
not
used
but
abused
and
when
people
should
be
providing
against
old
age
or
for
the
wants
of
a
growing
family
they
are
in
too
many
cases
feeding
folly
dissipation
and
vice
let
no
one
say
that
this
is
an
exaggerated
picture
it
is
enough
to
look
round
in
any
neighbourhood
and
see
how
much
is
spent
and
how
little
is
saved
what
a
large
proportion
of
earnings
goes
to
the
beershop
and
how
little
to
the
savings
bank
or
the
benefit
society
prosperous
times
are
very
often
the
least
prosperous
of
all
times
in
prosperous
times
mills
are
working
full
time
men
women
and
children
are
paid
high
wages
warehouses
are
emptied
and
filled
goods
are
manufactured
and
exported
wherries
full
of
produce
pass
along
the
streets
immense
luggage
trains
run
along
the
railways
and
ships
leave
our
shores
daily
for
foreign
ports
full
of
the
products
of
our
industry
everybody
seems
to
be
becoming
richer
and
more
prosperous
but
we
do
not
think
of
whether
men
and
women
are
becoming
wiser
better
trained
less
more
religiously
disposed
or
living
for
any
higher
purpose
than
the
satisfaction
of
the
animal
appetite
if
this
apparent
prosperity
be
closely
examined
it
will
be
found
that
expenditure
is
increasing
in
all
directions
there
are
demands
for
higher
wages
and
the
higher
wages
when
obtained
are
spent
as
soon
as
earned
intemperate
habits
are
formed
and
once
formed
the
habit
of
intemperance
continues
increased
wages
instead
of
being
saved
are
for
the
most
part
spent
in
drink
thus
when
a
population
is
thoughtless
and
improvident
no
kind
of
material
prosperity
will
benefit
them
unless
they
exercise
forethought
and
economy
they
will
alternately
be
in
a
state
of
hunger
and
burst
when
trade
falls
off
as
it
usually
does
after
exceptional
prosperity
they
will
not
be
comforted
by
the
thought
of
what
they
have
saved
had
it
ever
occurred
to
them
that
the
prosperous
times
might
not
have
proved
permanent
during
prosperous
times
saint

where

said
a
master
to
his

on
going
the
rounds
among
his
builders
this

must
be
pushed
on
and
covered
in

lasts

this

and
they

yet
dean
boyd
preaching
at
exeter
on
behalf
of
the
devonshire
hospitals
expressed
his
belief
that
the
annual
loss
to
the
workpeople
engaged
in
the
woollen
manufacture
the
cotton
trade
the
bricklaying
and
building
trade
by
idle
monday
amounted
to
over
seven
millions
sterling
if
man
chief
end
were
to
manufacture
cloth
silk
cotton
hardware
toys
and
china
to
buy
in
the
cheapest
market
and
to
sell
in
the
dearest
to
cultivate
land
grow
corn
and
graze
cattle
to
live
for
mere
money
profit
and
hoard
or
spend
as
the
case
might
be
we
might
then
congratulate
ourselves
upon
our
national
prosperity
but
is
this
the
chief
end
of
man
has
he
not
faculties
affections
and
sympathies
besides
muscular
organs
has
not
his
mind
and
heart
certain
claims
as
well
as
his
mouth
and
his
back
has
he
not
a
soul
as
well
as
a
stomach
and
ought
not
prosperity
to
include
the
improvement
and
of
his
morals
and
intellect
as
well
as
of
his
bones
and
muscles
mere
money
is
no
indication
of
prosperity
a
man
nature
may
remain
the
same
it
may
even
grow
more
stunted
and
deformed
while
he
is
doubling
his
expenditure
or
adding
cent
per
cent
to
his
hoards
yearly
it
is
the
same
with
the
mass
the
increase
of
their
gains
may
merely
furnish
them
with
increased
means
for
gratifying
animal
indulgences
unless
their
moral
character
keeps
pace
with
their
physical
advancement
double
the
gains
of
an
uneducated
overworked
man
in
a
time
of
prosperity
and
what
is
the
result
simply
that
you
have
furnished
him
with
the
means
of
eating
and
drinking
more
thus
not
even
the
material
of
the
population
is
secured
by
that
condition
of
things
which
is
defined
by
political
economists
as
national
prosperity
and
so
long
as
the
moral
elements
of
the
question
are
ignored
this
kind
of
prosperity
is
we
believe
calculated
to
produce
far
more
mischievous
results
than
good
it
is
knowledge
and
virtue
alone
that
can
confer
dignity
on
a
life
and
the
growth
of
such
qualities
in
a
nation
are
the
only
true
marks
of
its
real
prosperity
not
the
infinite
manufacture
and
sale
of
cotton
prints
toys
hardware
and
crockery
the
bishop
of
manchester
when
preaching
at
a
harvest
thanksgiving
near
preston
referred
to
a
letter
which
he
had
received
from
a
clergyman
in
the
south
of
england
who
after
expressing
his
pleasure
at
the
fact
that
the
agricultural
labourers
were
receiving
higher
wages
lamented
that
at
present
the
only
result
he
could
discover
from
their
higher
wages
was
that
a
great
deal
was
consumed
if
this
was
the
use
we
were
making
of
this
prosperity
we
could
hardly
call
it
a
blessing
for
which
we
had
a
right
or
ground
to
thank
god
the
true
prosperity
of
the
nation
consisted
not
so
much
in
the
fact
that
the
nation
was
growing
in
wealth
though
wealth
was
a
necessary
attribute
of
prosperity
but
that
it
was
growing
in
virtue
and
that
there
was
a
more
equable
distribution
of
comfort
contentment
and
the
things
of
this
lower
world
in
making
the
preceding
observations
we
do
not
in
the
least
advocate
the
formation
of
miserly
penurious
habits
for
we
hate
the
scrub
the
screw
the
miser
all
that
we
contend
for
is
that
man
should
provide
for
the
future
that
they
should
provide
during
good
times
for
the
bad
times
which
almost
invariably
follow
them
that
they
should
lay
by
a
store
of
savings
as
a
breakwater
against
want
and
make
sure
of
a
little
fund
which
may
maintain
them
in
old
age
secure
their
and
add
to
their
personal
comfort
and
social
thrift
is
not
in
any
way
connected
with
avarice
usury
greed
or
selfishness
it
is
in
fact
the
very
reverse
of
these
disgusting
dispositions
it
means
economy
for
the
purpose
of
securing
independence
thrift
requires
that
money
should
be
used
and
not
abused
that
it
should
be
honestly
earned
and
economically
employed
not
for
to
put
it
in
a
hedge
not
for
a
train
attendent
but
for
the
glorious
privilege
of
being
independent

england
is
one
of
the
richest
countries
in
the
world
our
merchants
are
enterprising
our
manufacturers
are
industrious
our
labourers
are
there
is
an
accumulation
of
wealth
in
the
country
to
which
past
times
can
offer
no
parallel
the
bank
is
gorged
with
gold
there
never
was
more
food
in
the
empire
there
never
was
more
money
there
is
no
end
to
our
manufacturing
productions
for
the
never
tires
and
yet
notwithstanding
all
this
wealth
there
is
an
enormous
mass
of
poverty
close
alongside
the
wealth
of
nations
there
gloomily
stalks
the
misery
of
nations
luxurious
ease
resting
upon
a
dark
background
of
wretchedness
parliamentary
reports
have
again
and
again
revealed
to
us
the
miseries
endured
by
certain
portions
of
our
working
population
they
have
described
the
people
employed
in
factories
workshops
mines
and
brickfields
as
well
as
in
the
pursuits
of
country
life
we
have
tried
to
grapple
with
the
evils
of
their
condition
by
legislation
but
it
seems
to
mock
us
those
who
sink
into
poverty
are
fed
but
they
remain
paupers
those
who
feed
them
feel
no
compassion
and
those
who
are
fed
return
no
gratitude
there
is
no
bond
of
sympathy
between
the
givers
and
the
receivers
thus
the
haves
and
the
the
opulent
and
the
indigent
stand
at
the
two
extremes
of
the
social
scale
and
a
wide
gulf
is
fixed
between
them
among
rude
and
savage
people
the
condition
of
poverty
is
uniform
provided
the
bare
appetites
are
satisfied
suffering
is
scarcely
felt
where
slavery
exists
indigence
is
little
known
for
it
is
the
interest
to
keep
the
slave
in
a
condition
fit
for
labour
and
the
employer
generally
takes
care
to
supply
the
animal
wants
of
the
employed
it
is
only
when
society
becomes
civilized
and
free
and
man
enters
into
competition
with
his
fellows
that
he
becomes
exposed
to
indigence
and
experiences
social
misery
where
civilization
as
in
this
country
has
reached
its
highest
point
and
where
large
accumulations
of
wealth
have
been
made
the
misery
of
the
indigent
classes
is
only
rendered
more
acute
by
the
comfort
and
luxury
with
which
it
is
placed
in
immediate
contrast
much
of
the
existing
misery
is
caused
by
selfishness
by
the
greed
to
accumulate
wealth
on
the
one
hand
and
by
improvidence
on
the
other
accumulation
of
money
has
become
the
great
desire
and
passion
of
the
age
the
wealth
of
nations
and
not
the
happiness
of
nations
is
the
principal
aim
we
study
political
economy
and
let
social
economy
shift
for
itself
regard
for
number
one
is
the
prevailing
maxim
high
profits
are
regarded
as
the
no
matter
how
obtained
or
at
what
sacrifice
money
is
our

hundred

you
may
see
to
what
depths
human
misery
may
fall
they
work
eat
drink
and
sleep
that
constitutes
their
life
they
think
nothing
of
providing
for
or
for
next
week
or
for
next
year
they
abandon
themselves
to
their
sensual
appetites
and
make
no
provision
whatever
for
the
future
the
thought
of
adversity
or
of
coming
sorrow
or
of
the
helplessness
that
comes
with
years
and
sickness
never
crosses
their
minds
in
these
respects
they
resemble
the
savage
tribes
who
know
no
better
and
do
no
worse
like
the
north
american
indians
they
debase
themselves
by
the
vices
which
accompany
civilization
but
make
no
use
whatever
of
its
benefits
and
advantages
captain
parry
found
the
esquimaux
near
the
north
pole
as
uncivilized
as
the
miserable
creatures
who
inhabit
the
dens
of
our
great
cities
they
were
of
course
improvident
for
like
savages
generally
they
never
save
they
were
always
either
feasting
or
famished
when
they
found
a
quantity
of
whale
blubber
they
would
eat
as
much
of
it
as
they
could
and
hide
the
rest
yet
their
improvidence
gave
them
no
concern
even
when
they
had
been
without
food
or
fuel
for
days
together
they
would
be
as
gay
and
as
usual
they
never
thought
of
how
they
should
be
provided
for
saving
for
the
future
forms
no
part
of
the
savage
economy
amongst
civilized
peoples
cold
is
said
to
be
the
parent
of
frugality
thus
the
northern
nations
of
europe
owe
a
portion
of
their
prosperity
to
the
rigour
of
their
climate
cold
makes
them
save
during
summer
to
provide
food
coal
and
clothing
during
winter
it
encourages
and
housekeeping
hence
germany
is
more
industrious
than
sicily
holland
and

when
the
late
edward
denison
for
newark
with
unexampled
gave
up
a
large
portion
of
his
time
and
labour
to
reclaim
the
comparatively
uncivilized
population
of
the
east
end
of
london
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
erect
an
iron
church
of
two
stories
the
lower
part
of
which
was
used
as
a
school
and
lecture
room
and
also
as
a
club
where
men
and
boys
might
read
play
games
and
do
anything
else
that
might
keep
them
out
of
the
what
is
so
bad
in
this
quarter
said
denison
is
the
habitual
condition
of
this
mass
of
humanity
its
uniform
mean
level
the
absence
of
anything
more
civilizing
than
a
grinding
organ
to
raise
the
ideas
beyond
the
daily
bread
and
beer
the
utter
want
of
education
the
complete
indifference
to
religion
with
the
fruits
of
all
this
improvidence
dirt
and
their
secondaries
crime
and
disease
there
is
no
one
to
give
a
push
to
struggling
energy
to
guide
aspiring
intelligence
or
to
break
the
fall
of
unavoidable
misfortune
the
mission
clergyman
he
goes
on
to
say
is
a
sensible
energetic
man
in
whose
hands
the
work
of
the
is
making
as
much
progress
as
can
be
expected
but
most
of
his
energy
is
taken
up
in
serving
tables
nor
can
any
great
advance
be
made
while
every
nerve
has
to
be
strained
to
keep
the
people
from
absolute
starvation
and
this
is
what
happens
every
winter
what
a
monstrous
thing
it
is
that
in
the
richest
country
in
the
world
large
masses
of
the
population
should
be
condemned
annually
by
a
natural
operation
of
nature
to
starvation
and
death
it
is
all
very
well
to
say
how
can
it
be
helped
why
it
was
not
so
in
our
grandfathers
time
behind
us
they
were
in
many
ways
but
they
were
not
met
every
winter
with
the
spectacle
of
starving
thousands
the
fact
is
we
have
accepted
the
marvellous
prosperity
which
has
in
the
last
twenty
years
been
granted
us
without
reflecting
on
the
conditions
attached
to
it
and
without
nerving
ourselves
to
the
exertion
and
the
sacrifices
which
their
fulfilment
demands
and
yet
denison
clearly
saw
that
if
the
people
were
sufficiently
educated
and
taught
to
practise
the
virtue
of
thrift
much
of
this
misery
might
be
prevented
the
people
he
elsewhere
says
their
destitution
and
their
disease
probably
there
are
hardly
any
of
the
most
needy
who
if
they
had
been
only
moderately
frugal
and
provident
could
not
have
placed
themselves
in
a
position
to
tide
over
the
occasional
months
of
want
of
work
or
of
sickness
which
there
always
must
be
i
do
not
underrate
the
difficulty
of
laying
by
out
of
weekly
earnings
but
i
say
it
be
done
a
while
a
young
strong
unmarried
man
could
lay
by
half
his
weekly
wages
and
such
men
are
almost
sure
of
constant
employment
after
showing
how
married
men
might
also
save
denison
goes
on
to
say
saving
is
within
the
reach
of
nearly
every
man
even
if
quite
at
the
bottom
of
the
tree
but
if
it
were
of
anything
like
occurrence
the
destitution
and
disease
of
this
city
would
be
kept
within
quite
manageable
limits
and
this
will
take
place
i
may
not
live
to
see
it
but
it
will
be
within
two
generations
for
unfortunately
this
amount
of
change
may
be
effected
without
the
least
improvement
in
the
spiritual
condition
of
the
people
good
laws
energetically
enforced
with
compulsory
education
supplemented
by
gratuitous
individual
exertion
which
will
then
have
a
much
reduced
field
and
much
fairer
prospects
will
certainly
succeed
in
giving
the
mass
of
the
people
so
much
light
as
will
generally
guide
them
into
so
much
industry
and
morality
as
is
clearly
conducive
to
their
bodily
ease
and
advancement
in
life
the

and
the
inhabitants
of

is
thus
referred

the
difference
between
poverty
and
pauperism
is
brought
home
to
us
very
strongly
by
what
i
see
here

have

sumptuously

they

their

he
was
only
able

make
a
beginning
the
misery
arising
from
improvidence
which
he
so
deeply
deplored
still
exists
and
is
even
more
widely

it
is
not

the
artizan
who
spends
all
that
he
earns
but
the
classes
above
him
who
can
not
plead
the
same
excuse
of
ignorance
many
of
what
are
called
the
upper
classes
are
no
more
excusable
than
the
lower
they
waste
their
means
on
keeping
up
appearances
and
in
feeding
folly
dissipation
and
vice
no
one
can
reproach
the
english
workman
with
want
of
industry
he
works
harder
and
more
skilfully
than
the
workman
of
any
other
country
and
he
might
be
more
comfortable
and
independent
in
his
circumstances
were
he
as
prudent
as
he
is
laborious
but
improvidence
is
unhappily
the
defect
of
the
class
even
the
english
workmen
though
earning
more
money
than
the
average
of
professional
men
still
for
the
most
part
belong
to
the
poorer
classes
because
of
their
thoughtlessness
in
prosperous
times
they
are
not
accustomed
to
make
provision
for
adverse
times
and
when
a
period
of
social
pressure
occurs
they
are
rarely
found
more
than
a
few
weeks
ahead
of
positive
want
hence
the
skilled
workman
unless
trained
in
good
habits
may
exhibit
no
higher
a
life
than
that
of
the
mere
animal
and
the
earning
of
increased
wages
will
only
furnish
him
with
increased
means
for
indulging
in
the
gratification
of
his
grosser
appetites

trooped

abject

exceeded

of
the
most
incorrigible
of
faults
there

neighbourhoods
in
the
manufacturing

says
baker
in
a
recent
report
where
not
only
are
there
no
savings
worth
mentioning
but
where
within
a
fortnight
of
being
out
of
work
the
workers
themselves
are
starving
for
want
of
the
merest
necessaries
not
a
strike
takes
place
but
immediately
the
workmen
are
plunged
in
destitution
their
furniture
and
watches
are
sent
to
the
pawnshop
whilst
deplorable
appeals
are
made
to
the
charitable
and
numerous
families
are
cast
upon
the
this
habitual
improvidence
though
of
course
there
are
many
admirable
exceptions
is
the
real
cause
of
the
social
degradation
of
the
artizan
this
too
is
the
prolific
source
of
social
misery
but
the
misery
is
entirely
the
result
of
human
ignorance
and
for
though
the
creator
has
ordained
poverty
the
poor
are
not
necessarily
nor
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
miserable
misery
is
the
result
of
moral
causes
most
commonly
of
individual
vice
and
improvidence
the

norris
in
speaking
of
the
habits
of
the
highly
paid
miners
and
of
south
staffordshire
says
improvidence
is
too
tame
a
word
for
it
it
is
recklessness
here
young
and
old
married
and
unmarried
are
uniformly
and
almost
avowedly
spendthrifts
one
sees
this
reckless
character
marring
and
vitiating
the
nobler
traits
of
their
nature
their
gallantry
in
the
face
of
danger
is
akin
to
foolhardiness
their
power
of
intense
labour
is
seldom
exerted
except
to
compensate
for
time
lost
in
idleness
and
revelry
their
readiness
to
make
for
their
sick
and
married
comrades
seems
only
to
obviate
the
necessity
of
previous
saving
their
very
creed
and
after
their
sort
they
are
a
curiously
devotional
people
holding
frequent
in
the
pits
often
degenerates
into
fanatical
fatalism
but
it
is
seen
far
more
painfully
and
unmistakably
in
the
alternate
plethora
and
destitution
between
which
from
year
end
to
year
end
the
whole
population
seems
to
oscillate
the
prodigal
revelry
of
the
the
drunkenness
of
sunday
the
refusal
to
work
on
monday
and
perhaps
tuesday
and
then
the
untidiness
of
their
home
towards
the
latter
part
of
the
two
or
three
weeks
which
intervene
before
the
next
their
children
kept
from
school
their
wives
and
daughters
on
the
their
furniture
in
the
pawnshop
the
crowded
and
miry
lanes
in
which
they
live
their
houses
often
cracked
from
top
to
bottom
by
the
in
of
the
ground
without
drainage
or
ventilation
or
due
supply
of
water
such
a
state
of
things
as
this
with
earnings
which
might
ensure
comfort
and
even
prosperity
seems
to
prove
that
no
legislation
can
cure
the
evil
we
have
certainly
had
numerous
reforms
we
have
had
household
suffrage
and
vote
by
ballot
we
have
relieved
the
working
classes
of
the
taxes
on
corn
cattle
coffee
sugar
and
provisions
generally
and
imposed
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
taxes
from
which
they
have
been
relieved
on
the
middle
and
upper
ranks
yet
these
measures
have
produced
but
little
improvement
in
the
condition
of
the
working
people
they
have
not
applied
the
principle
of
reform
to
themselves
they
have
not
begun
at
home
yet
the
end
of
all
reform
is
the
improvement
of
the
individual
everything
that
is
wrong
in
society
results
from
that
which
is
wrong
in
the
individual
when
men
are
bad
society
is
bad
franklin
with
his
shrewd
common
sense
observed
the
taxes
are
indeed
very
heavy
and
if
those
laid
on
by
the
government
were
the
only
ones
we
had
to
pay
we
might
more
easily
discharge
them
but
we
have
many
others
and
much
more
grievous
to
some
of
us
we
are
taxed
quite
as
much
by
our
idleness
three
times
as
much
by
our
pride
and
four
times
as
much
by
our
folly
and
from
these
taxes
the
commissioners
can
not
ease
or
deliver
us
by
allowing
an
abatement
lord
john
russell
once
made
a
similar
statement
to
a
body
of
working
men
who
waited
upon
him
for
the
purpose
of
asking
relief
from
taxation
you
complain
of
the
taxes
he
said
but
think
of
how
you
tax
yourselves
you
consume
about
fifty
millions
yearly
in
drink
is
there
any
government
that
would
dare
to
tax
you
to
that
extent
you
have
it
in
your
own
power
greatly
to
reduce
the
taxes
and
that
without
in
any
way
appealing
to
us
complaining
that
the
laws
are
bad
and
that
the
taxes
are
heavy
will
not
mend
matters
aristocratic
government
and
the
tyranny
of
masters
are
nothing
like
so
injurious
as
the
tyranny
of
vicious
appetites
men
are
easily
led
away
by
the
parade
of
their
miseries
which
are
for
the
most
part
voluntary
and
the
results
of
idleness
thriftlessness
intemperance
and
misconduct
to
blame
others
for
what
we
suffer
is
always
more
agreeable
to
our
than
to
blame
ourselves
but
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
people
who
live
from
day
to
day
without
plan
without
rule
without
forethought
who
spend
all
their
earnings
without
saving
anything
for
the
future
are
preparing
beforehand
for
inevitable
distress
to
provide
only
for
the
present
is
the
sure
means
to
sacrificing
the
future
what
hope
can
there
be
for
a
people
whose
only
maxim
seems
to
be
let
us
eat
and
drink
for
we
die
all
this
may
seem
very
hopeless
yet
it
is
not
entirely
so
the
large
earnings
of
the
working
classes
is
an
important
point
to
start
with
the
gradual
diffusion
of
education
will
help
them
to
use
and
not
abuse
their
means
of
comfortable
living
the
more
extended
knowledge
of
the
uses
of
economy
frugality
and
thrift
will
help
them
to
spend
their
lives
more
soberly
virtuously
and
religiously
denison
was
of
opinion
that
much
of
this
might
be
accomplished
within
two
generations
social
improvement
is
always
very
slow
how
extremely
tardy
has
been
the
progress
of
civilization
how
gradually
have
its
humanizing
influences
operated
in
elevating
the
mass
of
the
people
it
requires
the
lapse
of
generations
before
its
effects
can
be
so
much
as
discerned
for
a
generation
is
but
as
a
day
in
the
history
of
civilization
it
has
cost
most
nations
ages
of
wars
before
they
could
conquer
their
right
of
existence
as
nations
it
took
four
centuries
of
persecutions
and
martyrdoms
to
establish
christianity
and

such

but
most
of
them
after

are

says
wages
are
increasing
as
there
is
more

more

spend
it
in

is
not
on
the

especially
amongst

it

letter
from
which
we
extract
the
following
no
doubt
such
earnings
seem
large
to
clerks
and
educated
men
who
after
receiving
a
costly
education
have
often
to
struggle
hard
for
bread
but
they
are
nevertheless
the
rightful
earnings
of
steady
manual
labour
and
i
have
the
pleasure
of
adding
that
while
all
steady
colliers
in
good
health
could
make
equally
good
wages
many
hundreds
in

are
quietly
doing

the

am
speaking
all

he
has
built
fifteen
good

and
disregarding
all

he
continues
his
habits
of
steady

whereby
he
hopes
to
accumulate
an

for
his

a
still
higher
rate

makes
three
hundred
a

the
rollers
in
rail
mills
often
make
much
more
in
busy
times
they
have
made
as
much
as
from
seven
to
ten
guineas
a
week
or
equal
to
from
three
to
five
hundred
a
year
but
like
the
workers
in
cotton
mills
the

are
often

paid
high

the
incomes
of
curates
have
certainly
increased
since
the
time
when
goldsmith
wrote
but
nothing
like
the
incomes
of
skilled
and
unskilled
workmen
if
curates
merely
worked
for
money
they
would
certainly
change
their
vocation
and
become
colliers
and
when
the
author
visited
renfrewshire
a
few
years
ago
the
colliers
were
earning
from
ten
to
fourteen
shillings
a
day
according
to
the
common
saying
they
were
making
money
like
a
minting
machine
to
take
an
instance
a
father
and
three
sons
were
earning
sixty
pounds
a
month
or
equal
to
a
united
income
of
more
than
seven
hundred
pounds
a
year
the
father
was
a
sober
steady
eident
man
while
the
high
wages
lasted
he
was
the
first
to
enter
the
pit
in
the
morning
and
the
last
to
leave
it
at
night
he
only
lost
five
days
in
one
year
the
loss
being
occasioned
by
and
holidays
believing
that
the
period
of
high
wages
could
not
last
long
he
and
his
sons
worked
as
hard
as
they
could
they
saved
a
good
deal
of
money
and
bought
several
houses
besides
educating
themselves
to
occupy
higher
positions
in
the
same
neighbourhood
another
collier
with
four
sons
was
earning
money
at
about
the
same
rate
per
man
that
is
about
a
mouth
or
nine
hundred
pounds
a
year
this
family
bought
five
houses
within
a
year
and
saved
a
considerable
sum
besides
the
last
information
we
had
respecting
them
was
that
the
father
had
become
a
contractor
that
he
employed
about
sixty
colliers
and
reddsmen
and
was
allowed
so
much
for
every
ton
of
coals
brought
to
bank
the
sons
were
looking
after
their
father
interests
they
were
all
sober
diligent
sensible
men
and
took
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
the
education
and
improvement
of
the
people
in

neighbourhood

system
as
the
colliery
advances
at
the

time
that
these
two
families
of
colliers
were
doing
so
well
it
was
very
different
with
the
majority
of
their
these
only
worked
about
three
days
in
every
week
some
spent
their
earnings
at
the
others
took
a
whisky
ploy
at
the
seaside
for
that
purpose
they
hired
all
the
gigs
droskies
cabs
or
machines
about
a
fortnight
beforehand
the
results
were
seen
as
the
successive
monday
mornings
come
round
the
magistrate
sat
in
the
neighbouring
town
where
a
number
of
men
and
women
with
black
eyes
and
broken
heads
were
brought
before
him
for
judgment
before
the
time
of
high
wages
the
business
was
got
through
in
an
hour
sometimes
there
was
no
business
at
all
but
when
the
wages
were
doubled
the
magistrate
could
scarcely
get
through
the
business
in
a
day
it
seemed
as
if
high
wages
meant
more
idleness
more
whisky
and
more
broken
heads
and
faces
these
were
doubtless
roaring
times
for
the
colliers
who
had
they
possessed
the
requisite
might
have
made
little
fortunes
many
of
the
men
who
worked
out
the
coal
remained
idle
three
or
four
days
in
the
week
while
those
who
burnt
the
coal
were
famished
and
frozen
for
want
of
it
the
working
people
who
were
colliers
will
long
remember
that
period
as
the
time
of
the
while
it
lasted
lord
elcho
went
over
to
tranent
a
village
in
east
lothian
to
address
the
colliers
upon
their
thriftlessness
their
idleness
and
their
attempted
combinations
to
keep
up
the
price
of
coal
he
had
the
moral
courage
a
quality
much
wanted
in
these
days
to
tell
his
constituents
some
hard
but
honest
truths
he
argued
with
them
about
the
coal
famine
and
their
desire
to
prolong
it
they
were
working
three
days
a
week
and
idling
the
other
days
some
of
them
did
not
do
a
stroke
of
work
during
a
week
or
a
fortnight
others
were
taking
about
a
hundred
bank
holidays
yearly
but
what
were
they
doing
with
the
money
they
earned
were
they
saving
it
for
a
rainy
day
or
when
the
roaring
times
no
longer
existed
were
they
preparing
to
fall
back
upon
the
he
found
that
in
one
case
a
man
with
his
two
sons
was
earning
seven
pounds
in
a
fortnight
i
should
like
he
said
to
see
those
scotchmen
who
are
in
the
mining
business
taking
advantage
of
these
happy
times
and
endeavouring
by
their
industry
to
rise
from
their
present
position
to
exercise
to
acquire
property
and
possibly
to
become
coal
masters
themselves
it
had
been
said
in
a
newspaper
that
a
miner
was
earning
wages
equal
to
that
of
a
captain
and
that
a
mining
boy
was
earning
wages
equal
to
that
of
a
lieutenant
in
her
majesty
service
i
only
know
said
lord
elcho
that
i
have
a
boy
who
when
he
first
joined
her
service
was
an
ensign
and
that
his
wage
to
earn
which
remember
he
had
under
the
purchase
system
to
pay
five
hundred
pounds
was
not
the
wage
you
are
now
receiving
but
the
wage
which
you
were
receiving
in
bad
times
and
that
was
only
five
shillings
a
day
it
might
be
said
that
the
collier
risks
his
life
in
earning
his
wages
but
so
does
the
soldier
and
the
gallant
boy
to
whom
lord
elcho
referred
afterwards
lost
his
life
in
the
ashantee
campaign
the
times
of
high
wages
did
not
leave
a
very
good
impression
on
the
public
mind
prices
became
higher
morals
became
lower
and
the
work
done
was
badly
done
there
was
a
considerable
deterioration
in
the
character
of
british
workmanship
we
began
to
rely
too
much
upon
the
foreigner
trade
was
to
a
large
extent
destroyed
and
an
enormous
loss
of
capital
was
sustained
both
by
the
workmen
and
by
the
masters
lord
aberdare
was
of
opinion
that
three
millions
sterling
were
lost
by
workmen
during
the
recent
strike
in
south
wales
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
workmen
were
in
enforced
idleness
at
once
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
were
lost
every
week
in
wages
during
the
time
that
they
remained
idle
what
the
employers
think
of
the
recent
flash
of
prosperity
can
easily
be
imagined
but
it
may
not
be
unnecessary
to
quote
some
of
the
statements
of
correspondents
a
large
employer
of
labour
in
south
lancashire
says
drunkenness
increases
and
personal
violence
is
not
sufficiently
discouraged
high
wages
and
household
suffrage
came
upon
the
people
before
education
had
prepared
them
for
the
change
in
a
large
near
newcastle
where
the
men
were
paid
the
highest
wages
for
rolling
plates
and
rails
and
where
they
were
earning
between
three
and
four
hundred
pounds
a
year
the
proprietors
observe
except
in
a
few
instances
we
are
afraid
that
workmen
and
their
families
spend
most
of
their
earnings
another
employer
in
south
staffordshire
says
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
men
employed
in
the
spend
the
whole
of
their
wages
before
the
end
of
the
following
week
there
are
of
course
some
exceptions
but
they
are
unhappily
very
few
another
in
south
wales
says
as
to
the
thrifty
habits
of
the
men
a
small
minority
are
careful
and
saving
they
generally
invest
their
money
in
cottage
property
but
the
great
majority
of
the
men
spend
their
money
often
before
they
earn
it
and
that
in
the
most
reckless
way
large
sums
are
spent
in
drink
this
leads
to
idleness
and
owing
to
drinking
and
idling
the
works
are
kept
short
of
men
until
about
wednesday
in
each
week
when
the
greater
part
of
the
most
idly
disposed
have
become
sobered
down
of
course
when
wages
are
low
the
men
work
more
regularly
there
is
less
drinking
and
altogether
the
condition
of
the
place
is
healthier
in
every
respect
both
in
a
moral
and
physical
sense
another
observer
remarks
that
the
miners
of
bilston
are
about
six
thousand
in
number
and
they
spend
more
than
fifty
thousand
pounds
annually
in
the
purchase
of
ale
and
liquors
their
improvidence
may
be
studied
with
advantage
in
the
bilston
market
no
other
market
is
supplied
with
finer
poultry
or
comparatively
to
the
population
in
greater
abundance
and
this
is
chiefly
if
not
entirely
for
the
consumption
of
the
labouring
classes
for
the
resident
inhabitants
not
directly
associated
with
those
classes
are
few
in
number
sordid
and
men
may
there
be
seen
buying
on
saturday
chickens
ducks
and
geese
which
they
eat
for
supper
and
in
some
instances
bottled
porter
and
wine
yet
so
little
have
they
beforehand
in
the
world
that
if
the
works
were
to
stop
they
would
begin
within
a
fortnight
to
pawn
the
little
furniture
of
their
cottages
and
their
clothes
for
subsistence
and
for
drink
mr
chambers
of
edinburgh
in
his
description
of
the
working
classes
of
sunderland
makes
these
remarks
with
deep
sorrow
i
mention
that
everywhere
one
tale
was
told
intemperance
prevails
to
a
large
extent
good
wages
are
squandered
on
mean
indulgences
there
is
little
care
for
the
morrow
and
the
workhouse
is
the
ultimate
refuge
one
man
a
skilled
worker
in
an
was
pointed
out
as
having
for
years
received
a
wage
of
one
guinea
a
day
or
six
guineas
a
week
he
had
spent
all
mostly
in
drink
and
was
now
reduced
to
a
lower
department
at
a
pound
a
week
another
illustration
occurs
a
clerk
at
blackburn
took
a
house
for
twenty
pounds
a
year
and
sublet
the
cellars

is

it
is
a

has
been

a

of
helpless
beings
into

it
is
heartless

selfish
in

it

seem

so
supinely
indifferent

to
be
very
much
the
fashion
to
draw
dolorous
pictures
of
the
condition

that
from

in
which
i
worked
as
a

until
i
took
final
leave
of
the

i
never
knew
what
it
was
to
want
a
shilling
that
my
two
uncles
my
grandfather
and
the
mason
with
whom
i
served
my
apprenticeship
all
working
men
had
had
a
similar
experience
and
that
it
was
the
experience
of
my
father
also
i
can
not
doubt
that
deserving
mechanics
may
in
exceptional
cases
be
exposed
to
want
but
i
can
as
little
doubt
that
the
cases
exceptional
and
that
much
of
the
suffering
of
the
class
is
a
consequence
either
of
improvidence
on
the
part
of
the
competently
skilled
or
of
a
course
of
trifling
during
the
term
of
apprenticeship
quite
as
common
as
trifling
at
school
that
always
lands
those
who
indulge
in
it
in
the
hapless
position
of
the
inferior
workman
it
is
most
disheartening
to
find
that
so
many
of
the
highest
paid
workmen
in
the
kingdom
should
spend
so
large
a
portion
of
their
earnings
in
their
own
personal
and
sensual
gratification
many
spend
a
third
and
others
half
their
entire
earnings
in
drink
it
would
be
considered
monstrous
on
the
part
of
any
man
whose
lot
has
been
cast
among
the
educated
classes
to
exhibit
such
a
degree
of
selfish
indulgence
and
to
spend
even
of
his

upon
objects
in

these

ought
to
go

he

talks

that
he

a
great
man
in

and
who
do
tell
him
what
are
the

of

it
is
difficult
to
account
for
the
waste
and
extravagance
of
working
people
it
must
be
the
hereditary
remnant

slavery
was

of
human
institutions
the
strong
man
made
the
weak
man
work
for
him
the
warlike
race
subdued
the
less
warlike
race
and
made
them
their
slaves
thus
slavery
existed
from
the
earliest
times
in
greece
and
rome
the
righting
was
done
by
freemen
the
labour
by
helots
and
bondsmen
but
slavery
also
existed
in
the
family
the
wife
was
the
slave
of
her
husband
as
much
as
the
slave
whom
he
bought

slavery
long
existed
among

it
existed
when

lauded
it
existed
in

times
when
the
household
work
was
done
by
slaves
the
saxons
were
notorious
and
the
irish
were
their
best
customers
the
principal
mart
was
at
bristol
from
whence
the
saxons
exported
large
numbers
of
slaves
into
ireland
so
that
according
to
irish
historians
there
was
scarcely
a
house
in
ireland
without
a
british
slave
in
it
when
the
normans
took

they
continued
slavery
they
made

themselves
whom
they
decreed

the

of
the
market
at

was
a
penny
for

and
fourpence
for
a
slave
not
a
serf
but
an
unconditional
bondsman
from
that
time
slavery
continued
in
various
forms
it
is

good
old
times
that
it
was

the
reign
of
henry
iv
that
villeins
farmers

were

to
school
and

dared
not
educate

son
for
the

without
a
licence
from

lord
the
kings
of
england
in
their
contests
with
the
feudal
aristocracy
gradually
relaxed
the
slave
laws
they
granted
charters
founding

burghs
and
when
the
slaves
fled
into
them
and
were
able
to
conceal
themselves
for
a
year
and
a
day
they
then
became

were

bound
for

their

still
continue
in

of
bondage

not

complied
with
the
provisions

from
having
become
subject
to
the
penalties
of

act

free
from
servitude
the

formerly
earned
only
enough
to
keep
them

nothing

we
say
that
the

of
the

as
of

but
a
survival
of
the
system

slavery
in
our

matters
have
now
become
entirely
different
the
workman
no
matter
what
his
trade
is
comparatively
free
the
only
slavery
from
which
he
suffers
is
his
passion
for
drink
in
this
respect
he
still
resembles
the
esquimaux
and
the
north
american
indians
would
he
be
really
free
then
he
must
exercise
the
powers
of
a
free
responsible
man
he
must
exercise
and
and
sacrifice
present
personal
gratifications
for
prospective
enjoyments
of

social
power
discontent
may
and
does
exhibit
itself
but
discontent
is
only
the

be
first
made
dissatisfied
with
the
lower
condition
out
of
which
he
has
to
rise

to
repose
while

be
rationally
dissatisfied

to
future
advancement
the
working
classes
very
much
themselves
though
they
receive
salaries
or
wages
beyond
the
average
earnings
of
professional
men
yet
many
of
them
have
no
other
thought
than
that
of
living
in
mean
houses
and
spending
their
surplus
time
and
money
in
drink
they
seem
wanting
in
respect
for
themselves
as
well
as
for
their
class
they
encourage
the
notion
that
there
is
something
degrading
in
labour
than
which
nothing
can
be
more
false
labour
of
all
kinds
is
dignifying
and
honourable
it
is
the
idler
above
all
others
who
is
undignified
and
dishonourable
let
the
working
man
says
sterling
try
to
connect
his
daily
task
however
mean
with
the
highest
thoughts
he
can
apprehend
and
he
thereby
secures
the
rightfulness
of
his
lot
and
is
raising
his
existence
to
his
utmost
good
it
is
because
the
working
man
has
failed
to
do
this
and
because
others
have
failed
to
help
him
as
they
ought
that
the
lot
of
labour
has
hitherto
been
associated
with
what
is
mean
and
degrading
with
respect
to
remuneration
the
average
of
skilled
mechanics
and
artisans
as
we
have
already
said
are
better
paid
than
the
average
of
working
curates
the
working
engineer
is
better
paid
than
the
ensign
in
a
marching
regiment
the
foreman
in
any
of
our
large
engineering
establishments
is
better
paid
than
an
army
surgeon
the
receives
over
a
guinea
a
day
while
an
assistant
navy
surgeon
receives
fourteen
shillings
and
after
three
years
service
shillings
with
rations
the
majority
of
dissenting
ministers
are
much
worse
paid
than
the
better
classes
of
skilled
mechanics
and
artizans
and
the
average
of
clerks
employed
in
and
warehouses
receive
wages
very
much
lower
skilled
workmen
might
and
if
they
had
the
will
they
would
occupy
a
social
position
as
high
as
the
educated
classes
we
refer
to
what
prevents
them
rising
merely
because
they
will
not
use
their
leisure
to
cultivate
their
minds
they
have
sufficient
money
it
is
culture
that
they
want
they
ought
to
know
that
the
position
of
men
in
society
does
not
depend
so
much
upon
their
earnings
as
upon
their
character
and
intelligence
and
it
is
because
they
neglect
their
abundant
opportunities
because
they
are
thriftless
and
spend
their
earnings
in
animal
enjoyments
because
they
refuse
to
cultivate
the
highest
parts
of
their
nature
that
they
are
excluded
or
rather
from
those
social
and
other
privileges
in
which
they
are
entitled
to
take
part
notwithstanding
their
high
wages
they
for
the
most
part
cling
to
the
dress
the
language
and
the
manners
of
their
class
they
appear
during
their
leisure
hours
in
filthy
dresses
and
unwashed
hands
no
matter
how
skilled
the
workman
may
be
he
is
ready
to
sink
his
mind
and
character
to
the
lowest
level
of
his
even
the
extra
money
which
he
earns
by
his
greater
skill
often
contributes
to
demoralize
and
degrade
him
and
yet
he
might
dress
as
well
live
as
well
and
be
surrounded
by
the
physical
comforts
and
intellectual
luxuries
of
professional
men
but
no
from
week
to
week
his
earnings
are
wasted
he
does
not
save
a
farthing
he
is
a
victim
and
when
work
becomes
slack
and
his
body
becomes
diseased
his
only
refuge
is
the
workhouse
how
are
these
enormous
evils
to
be
cured
some
say
by
better
education
others
by
moral
and
religious
instruction
others
by
better
homes
and
better
wives
and
mothers
all
these
influences
will
doubtless
contribute
much
towards
the
improvement
of
the
people
one
thing
is
perfectly
clear
that
an
immense
amount
of
ignorance
prevails
and
that
such
ignorance
must
be
dissipated
before
the
lower
classes
can
be
elevated
their
whole
character
must
be
changed
and
they
must
be
taught
in
early
life
habits
of
forecast
and
we
often
hear
that
knowledge
is
power
but
we
never
hear
that
ignorance
is
power
and
yet
ignorance
has
always
had
more
power
in
the
world
than
knowledge
ignorance
dominates
it
is
because
of
the
evil
propensities
of
men
that
the
costly
repressive
institutions
of
modern
governments
exist
ignorance
arms
men
against
each
other
provides
gaols
and
penitentiaries
police
and
constabulary
all
the
physical
force
of
the
state
is
provided
by
ignorance
is
required
by
ignorance
is
very
often
wielded
by
ignorance
we
may
well
avow
then
that
ignorance
is
power
ignorance
is
powerful
because
knowledge
as
yet
has
obtained
access
only
to
the
minds
of
the
few
let
knowledge
become
more
generally
diffused
let
the
multitude
become
educated
thoughtful
and
wise
and
then
knowledge
may
obtain
the
ascendancy
over
ignorance
but
that
time
has
not
yet
arrived
look
into
the
records
of
crime
and
you
will
find
that
for
one
man
possessed
of
wisdom
or
knowledge
who
commits
a
crime
there
are
a
hundred
ignorant
or
into
the
statistics
of
drunkenness
and
improvidence
of
all
sorts
still
ignorance
is
predominant
or
into
the
annals
of
pauperism
there
again
ignorance
is
power
the
principal
causes
of
anxiety
in
this
country
are
the
social
suffering
and
disease
which
proceed
from
ignorance
to
mitigate
these
we
form
associations
organize
societies
spend
money
and
labour
in
committees
but
the
power
of
ignorance
is
too
great
for
us
we
almost
despair
while
we
work
we
feel
that
much
of
our
effort
is
wasted
we
are
often
ready
to
give
up
in
dismay
and
recoil
from
our
encounter
with
the
powers
of
evil
how
forcible
are
right
words
exclaimed
job
yes
but
with
equal
justice
he
might
have
said
how
forcible
are
wrong
words
the
wrong
words
have
more
power
with
ignorant
minds
than
the
right
words
they
fit
themselves
into
wrong
heads
and
prejudiced
heads
and
empty
heads
and
have
power
over
them
the
right
words
have
often
no
meaning
for
them
any
more
than
if
they
were
the
words
of
some
dead
language
the
wise
man
thoughts
do
not
reach
the
multitude
but
fly
over
their
heads
only
the
few
as
yet
apprehend
them
the
physiologist
may
discuss
the
laws
of
health
and
the
board
of
health
may
write
tracts
for
circulation
among
the
people
but
half
the
people
can
not
so
much
as
read
and
of
the
remaining
half
but
a
very
small
proportion
are
in
the
habit
of
thus
the
laws
of
health
are
disregarded
and
when
fever
comes
it
finds
a
wide
field
to
work
upon
in
undrained
and
filthy
streets
and
noisome
pestilential
districts
foul
uncleansed
dwellings
large
populations
with
clean
water
and
with
pure
air
there
death
makes
fell
havoc
many
destitute
widows
and
children
have
to
be
maintained
out
of
the
and
then
we
reluctantly
confess
to
ourselves
that
ignorance
is
power
the
only
method
of
abating
this
power
of
ignorance
is
by
increasing
that
of
knowledge
as
the
sun
goes
up
the
sky
the
darkness
disappears
and
the
owl
the
bat
and
the
beasts
of
prey
slink
out
of
sight
give
the
people
knowledge
give
them
better
education
and
thus
crime
will
be
abated
drunkenness
improvidence
lawlessness
and
all
the
powers
of
evil
will
to
a
certain
extent
disappear
footnote
the
recent
reports
of
tremenheere
to
the
secretary
of
state
for
the
home
department
with
respect
to
the
condition
of
the
population
in
the
iron
and
coal
districts
show
that
he
places
considerable
reliance
upon
the
effect
of
education
the
evidence
which
he
brought
together
from
all
parts
of
the
country
shows
that
the
increase
of
immorality
with
the
increase
of
wages
was
attributed
to
the
low
tastes
and
desires
of
the
that
the
obstinate
refusal
of
the
men
to
exert
more
than
of
their
fair
powers
of
work
by
which
the
cost
of
production
is
largely
enhanced
capital
crippled
and
the
public
mulcted
was
due
to
the
same
cause
that
their
readiness
to
become
the
prey
of
unionists
and
agitators
is
traceable
to
their
want
of
the
most
elementary
principles
of
thought
that
most
of
the
accidents
which
are
of
weekly
occurrence
are
occasioned
by
their
stupidity
and
ignorance
that
wherever
they
have
advanced
in
intelligence
they
have
become
more
skilful
more
subordinate
and
more
industrious
these
facts
have
convinced
the
more
thoughtful
and
masters
that
the
only
sure
means
of
maintaining
their
ground
under
increasing
foreign
competition
and
averting
a
social
crisis
is
to
reform
the
character
of
the
rising
generation
of
operatives
by
it
must
however
be
admitted
that
education
is
not
enough
the
clever
man
may
be
a
clever
rogue
and
the
cleverer
he
is
the
cleverer
rogue
he
will
be
education
therefore
must
be
based
upon
religion
and
morality
for
education
by
itself
will
not
eradicate
vicious
propensities
culture
of
intellect
has
but
little
effect
upon
moral
conduct
you
may
see
clever
educated
literary
men
with
no
conduct
whatever
wasteful
improvident
drunken
and
vicious
it
follows
therefore
that
education
must
be
based
upon
the
principles
of
religion
and
morality
nor
has
the
poverty
of
the
people
so
much
to
do
with
their
social
degradation
as
is
commonly
supposed
the
question
is
essentially
a
moral
one
if
the
income
of
the
labouring
community
could
be
suddenly
doubled
their
happiness
will
not
necessarily
be
increased
for
happiness
does
not
consist
in
money
in
fact
the
increased
wages
might
probably
prove
a
curse
instead
of
a
blessing
in
the
case
of
many
there
would
be
an
increased
consumption
of
drink
with
the
usual
results
an
increase
of
drunken
violence
and
probably
an
increase
of
crime
the
late
clay
chaplain
of
the
preston
house
of
correction
after
characterizing
drunkenness
as
the
great
sin
proceeds
it
still
rises
in
savage
hostility
against
everything
allied
to
order
and
religion
it
still
barricades
every
avenue
by
which
truth
and
peace
seek
to
enter
the
poor
man
home
and
heart
whatever
may
be
the
predominant
cause
of
crime
it
is
very
clear
that
ignorance
religious
ignorance
is
the
chief
ingredient
in
the
character
of
the
criminal
this
combines
with
the
passion
for
liquor
and
offences
numberless
are
engendered
by
the
union
the
late
sir
arthur
helps
when
speaking
of
high
and
low
wages
and
of
the
means
of
getting
and
spending
money
thus
expresses
himself
on
the
subject
in
his
friends
in
council
my
own
conviction
is
that
throughout
england
every
year
there
is
sufficient
wages
given
even
at
the
present
low
rate
to
make
the
condition
of
the
labouring
poor
quite
different
from
what
it
is
but
then
these
wages
must
be
well
spent
i
do
not
mean
that
the
poor
could
of
themselves
alone
effect
this
change
but
were
they
seconded
by
the
advice
the
instruction
and
the
aid
not
given
in
money
or
only
in
money
lent
to
produce
the
current
interest
of
the
day
of
the
classes
above
them
the
rest
the
poor
might
accomplish
for
themselves
and
indeed
all
that
the
rich
could
do
to
elevate
the
poor
could
hardly
equal
the
advantage
that
would
be
gained
by
the
poor
themselves
if
they
could
thoroughly
subdue
that
one
vice
of
drunkenness
the
most
wasteful
of
all
the
vices
in
the
living
of
the
poor
as
indeed
of
all
of
us
there
are
two
things
to
be
considered
how
to
get
money
and
how
to
spend
it
now
i
believe
the
experience
of
employers
will
bear
me
out
in
saying
that
it
is
frequently
found
that
the
man
with
a
week
does
not
live
more
comfortably
or
save
more
than
the
man
with
the
families
of
the
two
men
being
the
same
in
number
and
general
circumstances
it
is
probable
that
unless
he
have
a
good
deal
of
prudence
and
thought
the
man
who
gets
at
all
more
than
the
average
of
his
class
does
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
or
only
finds
in
it
a
means
superior
to
that
which
his
fellows
possess
of
satisfying
his
appetite
for
drinking
notwithstanding
however
the
discouraging
circumstances
to
which
we
have
referred
we
must
believe
that
in
course
of
time
as
men
nature
becomes
improved
by
education
secular
moral
and
religious
they
may
be
induced
to
make
a
better
use
of
their
means
by
considerations
of
prudence
forethought
and
parental
responsibility
a
german
writer
speaks
of
the
education
given
to
a
child
as
equivalent
to
a
store
of
money
placed
at
its
disposal
by
the
parent
the
child
when
grown
to
manhood
may
employ
the
education
as
he
might
employ
the
money
badly
but
that
is
no
argument
against
the
possession
of
either
of
course
the
value
of
education
as
of
money
chiefly
consists
in
its
proper
use
and
one
of
the
advantages
of
knowledge
is
that
the
very
acquisition
of
it
tends
to
increase
the
capability
of
using
it
aright
which
is
certainly
not
the
case
with
the
accumulation
of
money
education
however
obtained
is
always
an
advantage
to
a
man
even
as
a
means
of
material
advancement
it
is
worthy
of
being
sought
after
not
to
speak
of
its
moral
uses
as
an
elevator
of
character
and
intelligence
and
if
as
lyon
playfair
insists
the
composition
between
industrial
nations
must
before
long
become
a
competition
mainly
of
intelligence
it
is
obvious
that
england
must
make
better
provision
for
the
education
of
its
industrial
classes
or
be
prepared
to
fall
behind
in
the
industrial
progress
of
nations
it
would
be
of
little
avail
said
brewster
of
edinburgh
to
the
peace
and
happiness
of
society
if
the
great
truths
of
the
material
world
were
confined
to
the
educated
and
the
wise
the
organization
of
science
thus
limited
would
cease
to
be
a
blessing
knowledge
secular
and
knowledge
divine
the
double
current
of
the
intellectual
of
man
must
not
merely
descend
through
the
great
arteries
of
the
social
frame
it
must
be
taken
up
by
the
minutest
capillaries
before
it
can
nourish
and
purify
society
knowledge
is
at
once
the
manna
and
the
medicine
of
our
moral
being
where
crime
is
the
bane
knowledge
is
the
antidote
society
may
escape
from
the
pestilence
and
may
survive
the
famine
but
the
demon
of
ignorance
with
his
grim
adjutants
of
vice
and
riot
will
pursue
her
into
her
most
peaceful
haunts
destroying
our
institutions
and
converting
into
a
wilderness
the
paradise
of
social
and
domestic
life
the
state
has
therefore
a
great
duty
to
perform
as
it
punishes
crime
it
is
bound
to
prevent
it
as
it
subjects
us
to
laws
it
must
teach
us
to
read
them
and
while
it
thus
teaches
it
must
teach
also
the
ennobling
truths
which
display
the
power
and
the
wisdom
of
the
great
lawgiver
thus
diffusing
knowledge
while
it
is
extending
education
and
thus
making
men
contented
and
happy
and
humble
while
it
makes
them
quiet
and
obedient
subjects
a
beginning
has
already
been
made
with
public
school
education
much
still
remains
to
be
done
to
establish
the
system
throughout
the
empire
at
present
we
are
unable
to
judge
of
the
effects
of
what
has
been
done
but
if
general
education
accomplish
as
much
for
england
as
it
has
already
accomplished
for
germany
the
character
of
this
country
will
be
immensely
improved
during
the
next
twenty
years
education
has
almost
banished
drunkenness
from
germany
and
had
england
no
drunkenness
no
thriftlessness
no
reckless
multiplication
our
social
miseries
would
be
comparatively
trivial
we
must
therefore
believe
that
as
intelligence
extends
amongst
the
working
class
and
as
a
better
moral
tone
pervades
them
there
will
be
a
rapid
improvement
in
their
sober
thrifty
and
provident
habits
for
these
form
the
firmest
and
surest
foundations
for
social
advancement
there
is
a
growing
desire
on
the
part
of
the
more
advanced
minds
in
society
to
see
the
working
men
take
up
their
right
position
they
who
do
society
work
who
produce
under
the
direction
of
the
most
intelligent
of
their
number
the
wealth
of
the
nation
are
entitled
to
a
much
higher
place
than
they
have
yet
assumed
we
believe
in
this
good
time
coming
for
working
men
and
women
when
an
atmosphere
of
intelligence
shall
pervade
them
when
they
will
prove
themselves
as
enlightened
polite
and
independent
as
the
other
classes
of
society
and
as
the
first
and
surest
step
towards
this
consummation
we
counsel
them
to
provide
to
provide
for
the
future
as
well
as
for
the
present
to
provide
in
times
of
youth
and
plenty
against
the
times
of
adversity
misfortune
and
old
age
if
any
one
intends
to
improve
his
condition
said
the
late
william
felkin
mayor
of
nottingham
himself
originally
a
working
man
he
must
earn
all
he
can
spend
as
little
as
he
can
and
make
what
he
does
spend
bring
him
and
his
family
all
the
real
enjoyment
he
can
the
first
saving
which
a
working
man
makes
out
of
his
earnings
is
the
first
step
and
because
it
is
the
first
the
most
important
step
towards
true
independence
now
independence
is
as
practicable
in
the
case
of
an
industrious
and
economic
though
originally
poor
workman
as
in
that
of
the
tradesman
or
merchant
and
is
as
great
and
estimable
a
blessing
the
same
process
must
be
attended
to
that
is
the
entire
expenditure
being
kept
below
the
clear
income
all
contingent
claims
being
carefully
considered
and
provided
for
and
the
surplus
held
sacred
to
be
employed
for
those
purposes
and
those
only
which
duty
or
conscience
may
point
out
as
important
or
desirable
this
requires
a
course
of
laborious
exertion
and
strict
economy
a
little
foresight
and
possibly
some
privation
but
this
is
only
what
is
common
to
all
desirable
objects
and
inasmuch
as
i
know
what
it
is
to
labour
with
the
hands
long
hours
and
for
small
wages
as
well
as
any
workman
to
whom
i
address
myself
and
to
practise
withal
i
am
emboldened
to
declare
from
experience
that
the
gain
of
independence
or
rather
for
which
i
plead
is
worth
infinitely
more
than
all
the
cost
of
its
attainment
and
moreover
that
to
attain
it
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
according
to
circumstances
is
within
the
power
of
by
far
the
greater

inchbald
author
of

by
dint
of
thrift
able
to
set
apart
the
half
of

small

for
the
benefit
of

infirm
sister

was

about

my

not

have
ruined
thousands
the
words
waste
not
want
not
carved
in
stone
over
sir
walter
kitchen
fireplace
at
abbotsford
expresses
in
a
few
words
the
secret
of
order
in
the
midst
of
abundance
order
is
most
useful
in
the
management
of
everything
of
a
household
of
a
business
of
a
manufactory
of
an
army
its
maxim
is
a
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
place
order
is
wealth
for
whoever
properly
regulates
the
use
of
his
income
almost
doubles
his
resources
disorderly
persons
are
rarely
rich
and
orderly
persons
are
rarely
poor
order
is
the
best
manager
of
time
for
unless
work
is
properly
arranged
time
is
lost
and
once
lost
it
is
gone
for
ever
order
illustrates
many
important
subjects
thus
obedience
to
the
moral
and
natural
law
is
order
respect
for
ourselves
and
our
neighbours
is
order
regard
for
the
rights
and
obligations
of
all
is
order
virtue
is
order
the
world
began
with
order
chaos
prevailed
before
the
establishment
of
order
thrift
is
the
spirit
of
order
in
human
life
it
is
the
prime
agent
in
private
economy
it
preserves
the
happiness
of
many
a
household
and
as
it
is
usually
woman
who
regulates
the
order
of
the
household
it
is
mainly
upon
her
that
the
of
society
depends
it
is
therefore
all
the
more
necessary
that
she
should
early
be
educated
in
the
habit
and
the
virtue
of
orderliness
the
peer
the
merchant
the
clerk
the
artizan
and
the
labourer
are
all
of
the
same
nature
born
with
the
same
propensities
and
subject
to
similar
influences
they
are
it
is
true
born
in
different
positions
but
it
rests
with
themselves
whether
they
shall
live
their
lives
nobly
or
vilely
they
may
not
have
their
choice
of
riches
or
poverty
but
they
have
their
choice
of
being
good
or
evil
of
being
worthy
or
worthless
people
of
the
highest
position
in
point
of
culture
and
education
have
often
as
great
privations
to
endure
as
the
average
of
working
people
they
have
often
to
make
their
incomes
go
much
further
they
have
to
keep
up
a
social
standing
they
have
to
dress
better
and
live
sufficiently
well
for
the
purpose
of
health
though
their
income
may
be
less
than
that
of
colliers
and
they
are
under
the
moral
necessity
of
educating
their
sons
and
bringing
them
up
as
gentlemen
so
that
they
may
take
their
fair
share
of
the
world
work
thus
the
tenth
earl
of
buchan
brought
up
a
numerous
family
of
children
one
of
whom
afterwards
rose
to
be
lord
chancellor
of
england
upon
an
income
not
exceeding
two
hundred
a
year
it
is
not
the
amount
of
income
so
much
as
the
good
use
of
it
that
marks
the
true
man
and
viewed
in
this
light
good
sense
good
taste
and
sound
mental
culture
are
among
the
best
of
all
economists
the
late
aiton
said
that
his
father
brought
up
a
still
larger
family
on
only
half
the
income
of
the
earl
of
buchan
the
following
dedication
prefixed
to
his
work
on
clerical
economics
is
worthy
of
being
remembered
this
work
is
respectfully
dedicated
to
a
father
now
in
the
year
of
his
age
who
on
an
income
which
never
exceeded
a
hundred
pounds
yearly
educated
out
of
a
family
of
twelve
children
four
sons
to
liberal
professions
and
who
has
often
sent
his
last
shilling
to
each
of
them
in
their
turn
when
they
were
at
college
the
author
might
even
cite
his
own
case
as
an
illustration
of
the
advantages
of
thrift
his
mother
was
left
a
widow
when
her
youngest
child
the
youngest
of
eleven
was
only
three
weeks
old
notwithstanding
a
considerable
debt
on
account
of
a
suretyship
which
was
paid
she
bravely
met
the
difficulties
of
her
position
and
perseveringly
overcame
them
though
her
income
was
less
than
that
of
many
highly
paid
working
men
she
educated
her
children
well
and
brought
them
up
religiously
and
virtuously
she
put
her
sons
in
the
way
of
doing
well
and
if
they
have
not
done
so
it
was
through
no
fault
of
hers
hume
the
historian
was
a
man
of
good
family
but
being
a
younger
brother
his
means
were
very
small
his
father
died
while
he
was
an
infant
he
was
brought
up
by
his
mother
who
devoted
herself
entirely
to
the
rearing
and
educating
of
her
children
at
young
hume
went
to
france
to
prosecute
his
studies
there
says
he
in
his
autobiography
i
laid
down
that
plan
of
life
which
i
have
steadily
and
successfully
pursued
i
resolved
to
make
a
very
rigid
frugality
supply
my
deficiency
of
fortune
to
maintain
unimpaired
my
independency
and
to
regard
every
object
as
contemptible
except
the
improvement
of
my
talents
in
literature
the
first
book
he
published
was
a
complete
failure
but
he
went
on
again
composed
and
published
another
book
which
was
a
success
but
he
made
no
money
by
it
he
became
secretary
to
the
military
embassy
at
vienna
and
turin
and
at
he
thought
himself
rich
these
are
his
own
words
my
appointments
with
my
frugality
had
made
me
reach
a
fortune
which
i
called
independent
though
most
of
my
friends
were
inclined
to
smile
when
i
said
so
in
short
i
was
now
master
of
near
a
thousand
pounds
every
one
knows
that
a
thousand
pounds
at
five
per
means
fifty
pounds
a
year
and
hume
considered
himself
independent
with
that
income
his
friend
adam
smith
said
of
him
even
in
the
lowest
state
of
his
fortune
his
great
and
necessary
frugality
never
hindered
him
from
exercising
upon
proper
occasions
acts
both
of
charity
and
generosity
it
was
a
frugality
founded
not
on
avarice
but
upon
the
love
of
independency
but
one
of
the
most
remarkable
illustrations
of
thrift
is
to
be
found
in
the
history
of
the
rev
robert
walker
the
robert
walker
as
he
is
still
called
in
the
district
of
cumberland
where
he
resided
he
was
curate
of
leathwaite
during
the
greater
part
of
last
century
the
income
of
the
curacy
at
the
time
of
his
appointment
was
only
five
pounds
a
year
his
wife
brought
him
a
fortune
of
forty
pounds
is
it
possible
that
he
could
contrive
to
live
upon
his
five
pounds
a
year
the
interest
of
his
wife
fortune
and
the
result
of
his
labours
as
a
clergyman
yes
he
contrived
to
do
all
this
and
he
not
only
lived
well
though
plainly
but
he
saved
money
which
he
left
for
the
benefit
of
his
family
he
accomplished
all
this
by
means
of
industry
frugality
and
temperance
first
about
his
industry
he
thoroughly
did
the
work
connected
with
his
curacy
the
sabbath
was
in
all
respects
regarded
by
him
as
a
holy
day
after
morning
and
evening
service
he
devoted
the
evening
to
reading
the
scriptures
and
family
prayer
on
weekdays
he
taught
the
children
of
the
parish
charging
nothing
for
the
education
but
only
taking
so
much
as
the
people
chose
to
give
him
the
parish
church
was
his
school
and
while
the
children
were
repeating
their
lessons
by
his
side
he
was
like
shenstone
schoolmistress
engaged
in
spinning
wool
he
had
the
right
of
pasturage
upon
the
mountains
for
a
few
sheep
and
a
couple
of
cows
which
required
his
attendance
with
this
pastoral
occupation
he
joined
the
labours
of
husbandry
for
he
rented
two
or
three
acres
of
land
in
addition
to
his
own
acre
of
glebe
and
he
also
possessed
a
garden
the
whole
of
which
was
tilled
by
his
own
hand
the
fuel
of
the
house
consisted
of
peat
procured
by
his
labour
from
the
neighbouring
mosses
he
also
assisted
his
parishioners
in
haymaking
and
shearing
their
flocks
in
which
latter
art
he
was
eminently
dexterous
in
return
the
neighbours
would
present
him
with
a
haycock
or
a
fleece
as
a
general
acknowledgment
of
his
services
after
officiating
as
curate
of
leathwaite
for
about
twenty
years
the
annual
value
of
the
living
was
increased
to
seventeen
pounds
ten
shillings
his
character
being
already
well
known
and
highly
appreciated
the
bishop
of
carlisle
offered
walker
the
appointment
of
the
adjoining
curacy
of
ulpha
but
he
conscientiously
refused
it
on
the
ground
that
the
annexation
would
be
apt
to
cause
a
general
discontent
among
the
inhabitants
of
both
places
by
either
thinking
themselves
slighted
being
only
served
alternately
or
neglected
in
the
duty
or
attributing
it
to
covetousness
in
me
all
which
occasions
of
murmuring
i
would
willingly
avoid
yet
at
this
time
walker
had
a
family
of
eight
children
he
afterwards
maintained
one
of
his
sons
at
trinity
college
dublin
until
he
was
ready
for
taking
holy
orders
the
parish
pastor
was
of
course
a
most
economical
man
yet
no
act
of
his
life
savoured
in
the
least
degree
of
meanness
or
avarice
on
the
other
hand
his
conduct
throughout
life
displayed
the
greatest
disinterestedness
and
generosity
he
knew
very
little
of
luxuries
and
he
cared
less
tea
was
only
used
in
his
house
for
visitors
the
family
used
milk
which
was
indeed
far
better
excepting
milk
the
only
other
drink
used
in
the
house
was
water
clear
water
drawn
from
the
mountain
spring
the
clothing
of
the
family
was
comely
and
decent
but
it
was
all
it
was
simple
like
their
diet
occasionally
one
of
the
mountain
sheep
was
killed
for
purposes
of
food
and
towards
the
end
of
the
year
a
cow
was
killed
and
salted
down
for
provision
during
winter
the
hide
was
tanned
and
the
leather
furnished
shoes
for
the
family
by
these
and
other
means
this
venerable
clergyman
reared
his
numerous
family
not
only
preserving
them
as
he
so
affectingly
says
from
wanting
the
necessaries
of
life
but
affording
them
an
unstinted
education
and
the
means
of
raising
themselves
in
society
many
men
in
order
to
advance
themselves
in
the
world
and
to
raise
themselves
in
society
have
scorned
delights
and
lived
laborious
days
they
have
lived
humbly
and
frugally
in
order
to
accomplish
greater
things
they
have
supported
themselves
by
their
hand
labour
until
they
could
support
themselves
by
their
head
labour
some
may
allege
that
this
is
not
justifiable
that
it
is
a
sin
against
the
proletariat
to
attempt
to
rise
in
the
world
that
once
a
cobbler
always
a
cobbler
but
until
a
better
system
has
been
established
the
of
individuals
is
the
only
method
by
which
science
and
knowledge
can
be
conquered
and
the
world
permanently
advanced
goethe
says
it
is
perfectly
indifferent
within
what
circle
an
honest
man
acts
provided
he
do
but
know
how
to
understand
and
completely
fill
out
that
circle
and
again
an
honest
and
vigorous
will
could
make
itself
a
path
and
employ
its
activity
to
advantage
under
every
form
of
society
what
is
the
best
government
he
asks
that
which
teaches
us
to
govern
ourselves
all
that
we
need
in
his
opinion
is
individual
liberty
and
let
every
one
he
says
only
do
the
right
in
his
place
without
troubling
himself
about
the
turmoil
of
the
world
footnote
the
best
account
of
walker
is
to
be
found
in
the
appendix
to
the
poems
of
wordsworth
the
poet
greatly
appreciated
the
clergyman
character
and
noticed
him
in
his
excursion
as
well
as
in
the
notes
to
the
sonnets
entitled
the
river
duddon
at
all
events
it
is
not
by
socialism
but
by
individualism
that
anything
has
been
done
towards
the
achievement
of
knowledge
and
the
advancement
of
society
it
is
the
will
and
determination
of
individual
men
that
impels
the
world
forward
in
art
in
science
and
in
all
the
means
and
methods
of
civilization
individual
men
are
willing
to
deny
themselves
but
associated
communities
will
not
the
masses
are
too
selfish
and
fear
that
advantage
will
be
taken
of
any
sacrifices
which
they
may
be
called
upon
to
make
hence
it
is
amongst
the
noble
band
of
resolute
spirits
that
we
look
for
those
who
raise
and
elevate
the
world
as
well
as
themselves
the
recollection
of
what
they
have
done
acts
as
a
stimulus
to
others
it
braces
the
mind
of
man
reanimates
his
will
and
encourages
him
to
further
exertions
when
lord
elcho
addressed
the
east
lothian
colliers
he
named
several
men
who
had
raised
themselves
from
the
coalpit
and
first
of
all
he
referred
to
macdonald
member
for
stafford
the
beginning
of
my
acquaintance
with
macdonald
he
said
was
when
i
was
told
that
a
miner
wanted
to
see
me
in
the
lobby
of
the
house
of
commons
i
went
out
and
saw
macdonald
who
gave
me
a
petition
from
this
district
which
he
asked
me
to
present
i
entered
into
conversation
with
him
and
was
much
struck
by
his
intelligence
he
told
me
that
he
had
begun
life
as
a
boy
in
the
pit
in
lanarkshire
and
that
the
money
he
saved
as
a
youth
in
the
summer
he
spent
at
glasgow
university
in
the
winter
and
that
is
where
he
got
whatever
or
power
of
writing
he
possesses
i
say
that
is
an
instance
that
does
honour
to
the
miners
of
scotland
another
instance
was
that
of
hogg
who
began
as
a
pitman
in
this
county
worked
in
the
morning
attended
school
in
the
afternoon
then
went
to
the
university
for
four
years
and
to
the
theological
hall
for
five
years
and
afterwards
in
consequence
of
his
health
failing
he
went
abroad
and
is
now
engaged
as
a
missionary
in
upper
egypt
or
take
the
case
of
now
sir
george
elliot
member
for
north
durham
who
has
spoken
up
for
the
miners
all
the
better
for
having
had
practical
knowledge
of
their
work
he
began
as
a
miner
in
the
pit
and
he
worked
his
way
up
till
he
has
in
his
employment
many
thousand
men
he
has
risen
to
his
great
wealth
and
station
from
the
humblest
position
as
every
man
who
now
hears
me
is
capable
of
doing
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
if
he
will
only
be
thrifty
and
industrious
lord
elcho
might
also
have
mentioned
hutton
the
geologist
a
man
of
a
much
higher
order
of
genius
who
was
the
son
of
a
bewick
the
wood
engraver
is
also
said
to
have
been
the
son
of
a
campbell
was
the
son
of
a
loanhead
collier
he
was
the
forerunner
of
moffat
and
livingstone
in
their
missionary
journeys
among
the
bechuanas
in
south
africa
allan
ramsay
the
poet
was
also
the
son
of
a
miner
george
stephenson
worked
his
way
from
the
pithead
to
the
highest
position
as
an
engineer
george
began
his
life
with
industry
and
when
he
had
saved
a
little
money
he
spent
it
in
getting
a
little
learning
what
a
happy
man
he
was
when
his
wages
were
increased
to
twelve
shillings
a
week
he
declared
upon
that
occasion
that
he
was
made
a
man
for
life
he
was
not
only
enabled
to
maintain
himself
upon
his
earnings
but
to
help
his
poor
parents
and
to
pay
for
his
own
education
when
his
skill
had
increased
and
his
wages
were
advanced
to
a
pound
a
week
he
immediately
began
like
a
thoughtful
intelligent
workman
to
lay
by
his
surplus
money
and
when
he
had
saved
his
first
guinea
he
proudly
declared
to
one
of
his
colleagues
that
he
was
now
a
rich
man
and
he
was
right
for
the
man
who
after
satisfying
his
wants
has
something
to
spare
is
no
longer
poor
it
is
certain
that
from
that
day
stephenson
never
looked
back
his
advance
as
a
man
was
as
steady
as
the
light
of
sunrise
a
person
of
large
experience
has
indeed
stated
that
he
never
knew
amongst
working
people
a
single
instance
of
a
man
having
out
of
his
small
earnings
laid
by
a
pound
who
had
in
the
end
become
a
pauper
when
stephenson
proposed
to
erect
his
first
locomotive
he
had
not
sufficient
means
to
defray
its
cost
but
in
the
course
of
his
life
as
a
workman
he
had
established
a
character
he
was
trusted
he
was
faithful
he
was
a
man
who
could
be
depended
on
accordingly
when
the
earl
of
havensworth
was
informed
of
stephenson

at
once
furnished
him
with
the
means
for
enabling
him
to
carry
his
wishes
into
effect
watt
also
when
inventing
the
condensing
maintained
himself
by
making
and
selling
mathematical
instruments
he
made
flutes
organs
compasses
anything
that
would
maintain
him
until
he
had
completed
his
invention
at
the
same
time
he
was
perfecting
his
own
education
learning
french
german
mathematics
and
the
principles
of
natural
philosophy
this
lasted
for
many
years
and
by
the
time
that
watt
developed
his
and
discovered
mathew
boulton
he
had
by
his
own
efforts
become
an
accomplished
and
scientific
man
these
great
workers
did
not
feel
ashamed
of
labouring
with
their
hands
for
a
living
but
they
also
felt
within
themselves
the
power
of
doing
as
well
as
and
while
thus
labouring
with
their
hands
they
went
on
with
their
inventions
the
perfecting
of
which
has
proved
of
so
much
advantage
to
the
world
hugh
miller
furnished
in
his
own
life
an
excellent
instance
of
that
practical
common
sense
in
the
business
of
life
which
he
so
strongly
recommended
to
others
when
he
began
to
write
poetry
and
felt
within
him
the
growing
powers
of
a
literary
man
he
diligently
continued
his
labour
as
a
horace
walpole
has
said
that
queen
caroline
patronage
of
stephen
duck
the
thresher
poet
ruined
twenty
men
who
all
turned
poets
it
was
not
so
with
the
early
success
of
hugh
miller
there
is
no
more
fatal
error
he
says
into
which
a
working
man
of
a
literary
turn
can
fall
than
the
mistake
of
deeming
himself
too
good
for
his
humble
employments
and
yet
it
is
a
mistake
as
common
as
it
is
fatal
i
had
already
seen
several
poor
wrecked
mechanics
who
believing
themselves
to
be
poets
and
regarding
the
manual
occupation
by
which
they
could
alone
live
in
independence
as
beneath
them
and
become
in
consequence
little
better
than
mendicants
too
good
to
work
for
their
bread
but
not
too
good
virtually
to
beg
it
and
looking
upon
them
as
beacons
of
warning
i
determined
that
with
god
help
i
should
give
their
error
a
wide
offing
and
never
associate
the
idea
of
meanness
with
an
honest
calling
or
deem
myself
too
good
to
be
independent
at
the
same
time
a
man
who
feels
that
he
has
some
good
work
in
him
which
study
and
labour
might
yet
bring
out
is
fully
justified
in
denying
himself
and
in
applying
his
energies
to
the
culture
of
his
intellect
and
it
is
astonishing
how
much
carefulness
thrift
the
reading
of
books
and
diligent
application
will
help
such
men
onward
the
author
in
his
boyhood
knew
three
men
who
worked
in
an
agricultural
implement
maker
shop
they
worked
in
wood
and
iron
and
made
carts
ploughs
harrows
and
articles
somehow
or
other
the
idea
got
into
their
heads
that
they
might
be
able
to
do
something
better
than
making
carts
and
harrows
they
did
not
despise
the
lot
of
but
they
desired
to
use
it
as
a
step
towards
something
better
their
wages
at
that
time
could
not
have
exceeded
from
eighteen
to
twenty
shillings
a
week
two
of
the
young
men
who
worked
at
the
same
bench
contrived
to
save
enough
money
to
enable
them
to
attend
college
during
the
winter
at
the
end
of
each
session
they
went
back
to
their
and
earned
enough
wages
during
the
summer
to
enable
them
to
return
to
their
classes
during
the
winter
the
third
did
not
adopt
this
course
he
joined
a
mechanics
institute
which
had
just
been
started
in
the
town
in
which
he
lived
by
attending
the
lectures
and
reading
the
books
in
the
library
he
acquired
some
knowledge
of
chemistry
of
the
principles
of
mechanics
and
of
natural
philosophy
he
applied
himself
closely
studied
hard
in
his
evening
hours
and
became
an
accomplished
man
it
is
not
necessary
to
trace
their
history
but
what
they
eventually
arrived
at
may
be
mentioned
of
the
first
two
one
became
the
teacher
and
proprietor
of
a
large
public
school
the
other
became
a
dissenting
minister
while
the
third
working
his
way
strenuously
and
bravely
became
the
principal
engineer
and
manager
of
the
largest
steamship
company
in
the
world
although
mechanics
institutes
are
old
institutions
they
have
scarcely
been
supported
by
working
men
the
is
more
attractive
and
more
frequented
and
yet
mechanics
institutes
even
though
they
are
scarcely
known
south
of
yorkshire
and
lancashire
have
been
the
means
of
doing
a
great
deal
of
good
by
placing
sound
mechanical
knowledge
within
the
reach
of
even
the
few
persons
who
have
been
disposed
to
take
advantage
of
them
they
have
elevated
many
persons
into
positions
of
great
social
influence
we
have
heard
a
distinguished
man
say
publicly
that
a
mechanics
institution
had
that
but
for
the
access
which
it
had
afforded
him
to
knowledge
of
all
kinds
he
would
have
occupied
a
very
different
position
in
short
the
mechanics
institution
had
elevated
him
from
the
position
of
a
licensed
victualler
to
that
of
an
engineer
we
have
referred
to
the
wise
practice
of
men
in
humble
position
maintaining
themselves
by
their
trade
until
they
saw
a
way
towards
maintaining
themselves
by
a
higher
calling
thus
herschell
maintained
himself
by
music
while
pursuing
his
discoveries
in
astronomy
when
playing
the
oboe
in
the
at
bath
he
would
retire
while
the
dancers
were
lounging
round
the
room
go
out
and
take
a
peep
at
the
heavens
through
his
telescope
and
quietly
return
to
his
instrument
it
was
while
he
was
thus
maintaining
himself
by
music
that
he
discovered
the
georgium
sidus
when
the
royal
society
recognized
his
discovery
the
suddenly
found
himself
famous
franklin
long
maintained
himself
by
his
trade
of
printing
he
was
a
man
thrifty
frugal
and
a
great
saver
of
time
he
worked
for
character
as
much
as
for
wages
and
when
it
was
found
that
he
could
be
relied
on
he
prospered
at
length
he
was
publicly
recognized
as
a
great
statesman
and
as
one
of
the
most
scientific
men
of
his
time
ferguson
the
astronomer
lived
by
portrait
painting
until
his
merits
as
a
scientific
man
were
recognized
john
dollond
maintained
himself
as
a
silk
weaver
in
spitalfields
in
the
course
of
his
studies
he
made
great
improvements
in
the
refracting
telescope
and
the
achromatic
telescope
which
he
invented
gave
him
a
high
rank
among
the
philosophers
of
his
age
but
during
the
greater
part
of
his
life
while
he
was
carrying
on
his
investigations
he
continued
until
the
age
of
to
carry
on
his
original
trade
at
length
he
confined
himself
entirely
to
making
telescopes
and
then
he
gave
up
his
trade
of
a
silk
weaver
winckelmann
the
distinguished
writer
on
classical
antiquities
and
the
fine
arts
was
the
son
of
a
shoemaker
his
father
endeavoured
as
long
as
he
could
to
give
his
hoy
a
learned
education
but
becoming
ill
and
he
had
eventually
to
retire
to
the
hospital
winckelmann
and
his
father
were
once
accustomed
to
sing
at
night
in
the
streets
to
raise
fees
to
enable
the
boy
to
attend
the
grammar
school
the
younger
winckelmann
then
undertook
by
hard
labour
to
support
his
father
and
afterwards
by
means
of
teaching
to
keep
himself
at
college
every
one
knows
how
distinguished
he
eventually
became
samuel
richardson
while
writing
his
novels
stuck
to
his
trade
of
a
bookseller
he
sold
his
books
in
the
front
shop
while
he
wrote
them
in
the
back
he
would
not
give
himself
up
to
authorship
because
he
loved
his
independence
you
know
he
said
to
his
friend
defreval
how
my
business
engages
me
you
know
by
what
snatches
of
time
i
write
that
i
may
not
neglect
that
and
that
i
may
preserve
that
independency
which
is
the
comfort
of
my
life
i
never
sought
out
of
myself
for
patrons
my
own
industry
and
god
providence
have
been
my
whole
reliance
the
great
are
not
great
to
me
unless
they
are
good
and
it
is
a
glorious
privilege
that
a
middling
man
enjoys
who
has
preserved
his
independency
and
can
occasionally
though
not
stoically
tell
the
world
what
he
thinks
of
that
world
in
hopes
to
contribute
though
by
his
mite
to
mend
it
the
late
olynthus
gregory
in
addressing
the
deptford
institution
at
their
first
anniversary
took
the
opportunity
of
mentioning
various
men
in
humble
circumstances
some
of
whom
he
had
been
able
to
assist
who
by
means
of
energy
application
and
had
been
able
to
accomplish
great
things
in
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
thus
he
described
the
case
of
a
labourer
on
the
turnpike
road
who
had
become
an
able
greek
scholar
of
a
fifer
and
a
private
soldier
in
a
regiment
of
militia
both
mathematicians
one
of
whom
became
a
successful
schoolmaster
the
other
a
lecturer
on
natural
philosophy
of
a
journeyman
worker
who
invented
rules
for
the
solution
of
cubic
equations
of
a
country
sexton
who
became
a
teacher
of
music
and
who
by
his
love
of
the
study
of
musical
science
was
transformed
from
a
drunken
sot
to
an
exemplary
husband
and
father
of
a
coal
miner
a
correspondent
of
gregory
who
was
an
able
writer
on
topics
of
the
higher
mathematics
of
another
correspondent
a
labouring
whitesmith
who
was
also
well
acquainted
with
the
course
of
pure
mathematics
as
taught
at
cambridge
dublin
and
the
military
colleges
of
a
tailor
who
was
an
excellent
geometrician
and
had
discovered
curves
which
escaped
the
notice
of
newton
and
who
laboured
industriously
and
contentedly
at
his
trade
until
sixty
years
of
age
when
by
the
recommendation
of
his
scientific
friends
he
was
appointed
nautical
examiner
at
the
trinity
house
of
a
ploughman
in
lincolnshire
who
without
aid
of
men
or
books
discovered
the
rotation
of
the
earth
the
principles
of
spherical
astronomy
and
invented
a
planetary
system
akin
to
the
tychonic
of
a
country
shoemaker
who
became
distinguished
as
one
of
the
ablest
metaphysical
writers
in
britain
and
who
at
more
than
fifty
years
of
age
was
removed
by
the
influence
of
his
talents
and
their
worth
from
his
native
country
to
london
where
he
was
employed
to
edit
some
useful
publications
devoted
to
the
diffusion
of
knowledge
and
the
best
interests
of
mankind
students
of

ways
quentin
matsys
having
fallen
in
love
with
a
painter
daughter
and
determined
to
win
her
though
but
a
blacksmith
and
a
farrier
he
studied
art
so
diligently
and
acquired
so
much
distinction
that
his
mistress
afterwards
accepted
the
painter
whom
she
had
before
rejected
as
the
blacksmith
flaxman
however
married
his
wife
before
he
had
acquired
any
distinction
whatever
as
an
artist
he
was
merely
a
skilful
and
promising
pupil
when
sir
joshua
reynolds
heard
of
his
marriage
he
exclaimed
flaxman
is
ruined
for
an
artist
but
it
was
not
so
when
flaxman
wife
heard
of
the
remark
she
said
let
us
work
and
economize
i
will
never
have
it
said
that
ann
denbam
ruined
john
flaxman
as
an
artist
they
economized
accordingly
to
earn
money
flaxman
undertook
to
collect
the
local
rates
and
what
with
art
and
industry
the
patient
thrifty
couple
after
five
years
of
careful
saving
set
out
for
rome
together
there
flaxman
studied
and
worked
there
he
improved
his
knowledge
of
art
and
there
he
acquired
the
reputation
of
being
the
first
of
english
sculptors
the
greater
number
of
artists
have
sprung
from
humble
life
if
they
had
been
born
rich
they
would
probably
never
have
been
artists
they
have
had
to
work
their
way
from
one
position
to
another
and
to
strengthen
their
nature
by
conquering
difficulty
hogarth

his
career
by
engraving
william
sharp
began
by

tassie
the
sculptor
and
medallist
began
life
as
a
having
accidentally
seen
a
collection
of
pictures
he
aspired
to
become
an
artist
and
entered
an
academy
to
learn
the
elements
of
drawing
he
continued
to
work
at
his
old
trade
until
he
was
able
to
maintain
himself
by
his
new
one
he
used
his
labour
as
the
means
of
cultivating
his
skill
in
his
more
refined
and
elevated
profession
chantry
of
sheffield
was
an
economist
both
of
time
and
money
he
saved
fifty
pounds
out
of
his
earnings
as
a
carver
and
gilder
paid
the
money
to
his
master
and
cancelled
his
indentures
then
he
came
up
to
london
and
found
employment
as
a
journeyman
carver
he
proceeded
to
paint
portraits
and
model
busts
and
at
length
worked
his
way
to
the
first
position
as
a
sculptor
canova
was
a
like
his
father
and
his
grandfather
and
through
he
worked
his
way
to
sculpture
after
leaving
the
quarry
he
went
to
venice
and
gave
his
services
to
an
artist
from
whom
he
received
but
little
recompense
for
his
work
i
laboured
said
he
for
a
mere
pittance
but
it
was
sufficient
it
was
the
fruit
of
my
own
resolution
and
as
i
then
flattered
myself
the
foretaste
of
more
honourable
rewards
for
i
never
thought
of
wealth
he
pursued
his
studies
in
drawing
and
modelling
in
languages
poetry
history
antiquity
and
the
greek
and
roman
classics
a
long
time
elapsed
before
his
talents
were
recognised
and
then
he
suddenly
became
famous
lough
the
english
sculptor
is
another
instance
of
and
hard
work
when
a
boy
he
was
fond
of
drawing
at
school
he
made
drawings
of
horses
dogs
cows
and
men
for
pins
that
was
his
first
pay
and
he
used
to
go
home
with
his
jacket
sleeve
stuck
full
of
them
he
and
his
brothers
next
made
figures
in
clay
pope
homer
lay
on
his
window
the
boys
were
so
delighted
with
it
that
they
made
thousands
of
models
one
taking
the
greeks
and
the
other
the
trojans
an
odd
volume
of
gibbon
gave
an
account
of
the
coliseum
after
the
family
were
in
bed
the
brothers
made
a
model
of
the
coliseum
and
filled
it
with
fighting
gladiators
as
the
boys
grew
up
they
were
sent
to
their
usual
outdoor
work
following
the
plough
and
doing
the
usual
agricultural
labour
but
still
adhering
to
their
modelling
at
leisure
hours
at
lough
was
very
much
in
demand
everybody
wanted
him
to
make
models
in
pastry
for
christmas
pies
the
neighbouring
farmers
especially
it
was
capital
practice
he
afterwards
said
at
length
lough
went
from
newcastle
to
london
to
push
his
way
in
the
world
of
art
he
obtained
a
passage
in
a
collier
the
skipper
of
which
he
knew
when
he
reached
london
he
slept
on
board
the
collier
as
long
as
it
remained
in
the
thames
he
was
so
great
a
favourite
with
the
men
that
they
all
urged
him
to
go
back
he
had
no
friends
no
patronage
no
money
what
could
he
do
with
everything
against
him
but
having
already
gone
so
far
he
determined
to
proceed
he
would
not
go
back
at
least
not
yet
the
men
all
wept
when
he
took
farewell
of
them
he
was
alone
in
london
under
the
shadow
of
paul
his
next
step
was
to
take
a
lodging
in
an
obscure
first
floor
in
burleigh
street
over
a
greengrocer
shop
and
there
he
began
to
model
his
grand
statue
of
milo
he
had
to
take
the
roof
off
to
let
milo
head
out
there
haydon
found
him
and
was
delighted
with
his
genius
i
went
he
says
to
young
lough
the
sculptor
who
has
just
burst
out
and
has
produced
a
great
effect
his
milo
is
really
the
most
extraordinary
thing
considering
all
the
circumstances
in
modern
sculpture
it
is
another
proof
of
the
efficacy
of
inherent
genius
that
lough
must
have
been
poor
enough
at
this
time
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
during
the
execution
of
his
milo
he
did
not
eat
meat
for
three
months
and
when
peter
coxe
found
him
out
he
was
tearing
up
his
shirt
to
make
wet
rags
for
his
figure
to
keep
the
clay
moist
he
had
a
bushel
and
a
half
of
coals
during
the
whole
winter
and
he
used
to
lie
down
by
the
side
of
his
clay
model
of
the
immortal
figure
damp
as
it
was
and
shiver
for

here

precisely
what
you
have
so
long
been
dreaming
of
doing
the
exhibition
of

a
great
success
the

went
to

it

ordered

sir
matthew
white
eidley
was
much
struck
by
the
genius
of
young
lough
and
became
one
of
his
greatest
patrons
the
sculptor
determined
to
strike
out
a
new
path
for
himself
he
thought
the
greeks
had
exhausted
the
pantheistic
and
that
heathen
gods
had
been
overdone
lough
began
and
pursued
the
study
of
lyric
sculpture
he
would
illustrate
the
great
english
poets
but
there
was
the
obvious
difficulty
of
telling
the
story
of
a
figure
by
a
single
attitude
it
was
like
a
flash
of
thought
the
true
artist
he
said
must
plant
his
feet
firmly
on
the
earth
and
sweep
the
heavens
with
his
pencil
i
mean
he
added
that
the
soul
must
be
combined
with
the
body
the
ideal
with
the
real
the
heavens
with
the
earth
it
is
not
necessary
to
describe
the
success
of
lough
as
a
sculptor
his
statue
of
the
mourners
is
known
all
over
the
world
he
has
illustrated
shakespeare
and
milton
his
puck
titania
and
other
great
works
are
extensively
known
and
their
genius
universally
admired
but
it
may
be
mentioned
that
his
noble
statue
of
milo
was
not
cast
in
bronze
until
when
it
was
exhibited
at
the
international
exhibition
of
that
year
the
earl
of
derby
in
recently
distributing
the
prizes
to
the
successful
pupils
of

liverpool
college
made
the
following
observations
the
vast
majority
of
men
in
all
ages
and
countries
must
work
before
they
can
eat
even
those
who
are
not
under
the
necessity
are
in
england
generally
impelled
by
example
by
custom
perhaps
by
a
sense
of
what
is
fitted
for
them
to
adopt
what
is
called
an
active
pursuit
of
some
sort
if
there
is
one
thing
more
certain
than
another
it
is
this
that
every
member
of
a
community
is
bound
to
do
something
for
that
community
in
return
for
what
he
gets
from
it
and
neither
intellectual
cultivation
nor
the
possession
of
material
wealth
nor
any
other
plea
whatever
except
that
of
physical
or
mental
incapacity
can
excuse
any
of
us
from
that
plain
and
personal
duty
and
though
it
may
be
in
a
community
like
this
considered
by
some
to
be
a
heterodox
view
i
will
say
that
it
often
appears
to
me
in
the
present
day
that
we
are
a
little
too
apt
in
all
classes
to
look
upon
ourselves
as
mere
machines
for
what
is
called
on
and
to
forget
that
there
are
in
every
human
being
many
faculties
which
can
not
be
employed
and
many
wants
which
can
not
be
satisfied
by
that
occupation
i
have
not
a
word
to
utter
against
strenuous
devotion
to
business
while
you
are
at
it
but
one
of
the
wisest
and
most
thoroughly
cultivated
men
whom
i
ever
knew
retired
before
the
age
of
fifty
from
a
profession
in
which
he
was
making
an
enormous
income
because
he
said
he
had
got
as
much
as
he
or
any
one
belonging
to
him
could
want
and
he
did
not
see
why
he
should
sacrifice
the
rest
of
his
life
to
some
people
thought
him
very
foolish
i
did
not
and
i
believe
that
the
gentleman
of
whom
i
speak
never
once
repented
his
decision
footnote

collection
ought

the
gentleman
to
whom
lord

referred
was
nasmyth
the
inventor
of
the
steam
hammer
and
as
he
has
himself
permitted
the
story
of
his
life
to
be
published
there
is
no
necessity
for
concealing
his
name
his
life
is
besides
calculated
to
furnish
one
of
the
best
illustrations
of
our
subject
when
a
boy
he
was
of
a
bright
active
cheerful
disposition
to
a
certain
extent
he
inherited
his
mechanical
powers
from
his
father
who
besides
being
an
excellent
painter
was
a
thorough
mechanic
it
was
in
his
workshop
that
the
boy
made
his
first
acquaintance
with
tools
he
also
had
for
his
companion
the
son
of
an
and
he
often
went
to
the
founder
shop
to
watch
the
moulding
casting
forging
and
work
that
was
going
on
i
look
back
nasmyth
says
to
the
hours
of
saturday
afternoons
spent
in
having
the
run
of
the
workshops
of
this
small
foundry
as
the
true
and
only
apprenticeship
of
my
life
i
did
not
trust
to
reading
about
such
things
i
saw
handled
and
helped
when
i
could
and
all
the
ideas
in
connection
with
them
became
in
all
details
ever
after
permanent
in
my
mind
to
say
nothing
of
the
no
small
acquaintance
obtained
at
the
same
time
of
the
nature
of
workmen
in
course
of
time
young
nasmyth
with
the
aid
of
his
father
tools
could
do
little
jobs
for
himself
he
made
steels
for
which
he
sold
to
his
schoolfellows
he
made
model
and
sectional
models
for
use
at
popular
lectures
and
in
schools
and
by
selling
such
models
he
raised
sufficient
money
to
enable
him
to
attend
the
lectures
on
natural
philosophy
and
chemistry
at
the
edinburgh
university
among
his
works
at
that
time
was
a
working
model
of
a
steam
carriage
for
use
on
common
roads
it
worked
so
well
that
he
was
induced
to
make
another
on
a
larger
scale
after
having
been
successfully
used
he
sold
the
engine
for
the
purpose
of
driving
a
small
factory
nasmyth
was
now
twenty
years
old
and
wished
to
turn
his
practical
faculties
to
account
his
object
was
to
find
employment
in
one
of
the
great
engineering
establishments
of
the
day
the
first
in
his
opinion
was
that
of
henry
maudslay
of
london
to
attain
his
object
he
made
a
small
every
part
of
which
was
his
own
handiwork
including
the
casting
and
forging
he
proceeded
to
london
introduced
himself
to
the
great
engineer
submitted
his
drawings
showed
his
models
and
was
finally
engaged
as
maudslay
private
workman
then
came
the
question
of
wages
when
nasmyth
finally
left
home
to
begin
the
world
on
his
own
account
he
determined
to
cost
his
father
another
being
the
youngest
of
eleven
children
he
thought
that
he
could
maintain
himself
without
trenching
farther
upon
the
family
means
and
he
nobly
fulfilled
his
determination
he
felt
that
the
wages
sufficient
to
maintain
other
workmen
would
surely
be
sufficient
to
maintain
him
he
might
have
to
exercise
and
but
of
course
he
could
do
that
though
but
a
youth
he
had
wisdom
enough
and
enough
to
deny
himself
everything
that
was
unnecessary
in
order
to
preserve
the
valuable
situation
which
he
had
obtained
well
about
the
wages
when
maudslay
referred
his
young
workman
to
the
chief
cashier
as
to
his
weekly
wages
it
was
arranged
that
nasmyth
was
to
receive
ten
shillings
a
week
he
knew
that
by
strict
economy
he
could
live
within
this
amount
he
contrived
a
small
cooking
apparatus
of
which
we
possess
the
drawings
it
is
not
necessary
to
describe
his
method
of
cooking
nor
his
method
of
living
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
his
little
cooking
apparatus
in
which
he
still
takes
great
pride
enabled
him
fully
to
accomplish
his
purpose
he
lived
within
his
means
and
did
not
cost
his
father
another
farthing
next
year
his
wages
were
increased
to
fifteen
shillings
he
then
began
to
save
money
he
did
not
put
it
in
a
bank
but
used
his
savings
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
tools
with
which
he
afterwards
commenced
business
in
the
third
year
of
his
service
his
wages
were
again
increased
on
account
doubtless
of
the
value
of
his
services
i
do
know
he
has
since
said
that
any
future
period
of
my
life
abounded
in
such
high
enjoyment
of
existence
as
the
three
years
i
spent
at
maudslay
it
was
a
glorious
situation
for
one
like
myself
so
earnest
as
i
was
in
all
that
related
to
mechanism
in
the
study
of
men
as
well
as
of
machinery
i
wish
many
a
young
man
would
do
as
i
then
did
i
am
sure
they
would
find
their
reward
in
that
feeling
of
constant
improvement
of
daily
advancement
and
true
independence
which
will
ever
have
a
charm
for
those
who
are
earnest
in
their
endeavours
to
make
right
progress
in
life
and
in
the
regard
of
all
good
men
after
three
years
spent
at
maudslay
nasmyth
returned
to
edinburgh
to
construct
a
small
stock
of
engineering
tools
suitable
for
starting
him
in
business
on
his
own
account
he
hired
a
workshop
and
did
various
engineering
jobs
in
order
to
increase
his
little
store
of
money
and
to
execute
his
little
stock
of
tools
this
occupied
him
for
two
years
and
in
he
removed
the
whole
of
his
tools
and
machinery
to
manchester
he
began
business
there
in
a
very
humble
way
but
it
increased
so
rapidly
that
he
was
induced
to
remove
to
a
choice
piece
of
land
on
the
banks
of
the
bridgewater
canal
at
patricroft
and
there
make
a
beginning
at
first
in
wooden
sheds
of
the
now
famous
bridgewater
foundry
there
says
he
i
toiled
right
heartily
until
december
when
i
retired
to
enjoy
in
leisure
the
result
of
many
an
anxious
and
interesting
day
i
had
there
with
the
blessing
of
god
devoted
the
best
years
of
my
life
to
the
pursuit
of
a
business
of
which
i
was
proud
and
i
trust
that
without
undue
vanity
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
that
i
have
left
my
mark
upon
several
useful
inventions
which
probably
have
had
no
small
share
in
the
mechanical
works
of
the
age
there
is
scarcely
a
steamship
or
locomotive
that
is
not
indebted
to
my
steam
hammer
and
without
it
armstrong
and
whitworth
guns
and
could
scarcely
have
existed
but
though
nasmyth
retired
from
business
at
the
age
of
he
did
not
seek
repose
in
idleness
he
continues
to
be
as
busy
as
the
busiest
but
in
an
altogether
different
direction
instead
of
being
tied
to
the
earth
he
enjoys
himself
amongst
the
stars
by
means
of
telescopes
of
his
own
making
he
has
investigated
the
sun
and
discovered
its
willow
leaves
he
has
examined
and
photographed
the
moon
and
in
the
monograph
of
it
which
he
has
published
he
has
made
us
fully
acquainted
with
its
geography
he
is
also
a
thorough
artist
and
spends
a
considerable
portion
of
his
time
in
painting
though
he
is
too
modest
to
exhibit
the
last
time
we
visited
his
beautiful
home
at
hammerfield
he
was
busy
polishing
glasses
for
one
of
his
new
telescopes

another
word
before
we
have
done

said
nasmyth

were
to
try
to
compress
into
one
sentence
the
whole
of
the
experience
i
have
had
during
an
active
and
successful
life
and
offer
it
to
young
men
as

rule
and

for
success

station

would

composed

their
i
am
satisfied
that
what
is
generally
termed

luck

is
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
simply
the
result
of
the
above
simple
maxim
such
experience
as
i
have
had
convinces
me
that
absence
of
success
arises
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
from
want
of
and
want
of
common
sense
the
worst
of
all
maxims
is

methods
of
economy
it
was
with
profound
wisdom
that
the
romans
called
by
the
same
name
courage
and
virtue
there
is
in
fact
no
virtue
properly
so
called
without
victory
over
ourselves
and
what
cost
us
nothing
is
worth
nothing
almost
all
the
advantages
which
man
possesses
above
the
inferior
animals
arise
from
his
power
of
acting
in
combination
with
his
fellows
and
of
accomplishing
by
the
united
efforts
of
numbers
what
could
not
be
accomplished
by
the
detached
efforts
of
for
the
future
our
main
security
will
be
in
the
wider
diffusion
of
property
and
in
all
such
measures
as
will
facilitate
this
result
with
the
possession
of
property
will
come
conservative
instincts
and
disinclination
for
rash
and
reckless
schemes
we
trust
much
therefore
to
the
rural
population
becoming
proprietors
and
to
the
urban
population
becoming
the
methods
of
practising
economy
are
very
simple
spend
less
than
you
earn
that
is
the
first
rule
a
portion
should
always
be
set
apart
for
the
future
the
person
who
spends
more
than
he
earns
is
a
fool
the
civil
law
regards
the
spendthrift
as
akin
to
the
lunatic
and
frequently
takes
from
him
the
management
of
his
own
affairs
the
next
rule
is
to
pay
ready
money
and
never
on
any
account
to
run
into
debt
the
person
who
runs
into
debt
is
apt
to
get
cheated
and
if
he
runs
into
debt
to
any
extent
he
will
himself
be
apt
to
get
dishonest
who
pays
what
he
owes
enriches
himself
the
next
is
never
to
anticipate
uncertain
profits
by
expending
them
before
they
are
secured
the
profits
may
never
come
and
in
that
case
you
will
have
taken
upon
yourself
a
load
of
debt
which
you
may
never
get
rid
of
it
will
sit
upon
your
shoulders
like
the
old
man
in
sinbad
another
method
of
economy
is
to
keep
a
regular
account
of
all
that
you
earn
and
of
all
that
you
expend
an
orderly
man
will
know
beforehand
what
he
requires
and
will
be
provided
with
the
necessary
means
for
obtaining
it
thus
his
domestic
budget
will
be
balanced
and
his
expenditure
kept
within
his
income
john
wesley
regularly
adopted
this
course
although
he
possessed
a
small
income
he
always
kept
his
eyes
upon
the
state
of
his
affairs
a
year
before
his
death
he
wrote
with
a
trembling
hand
in
his
journal
of
expenses
for
more
than
years
i
have
kept
my
accounts
exactly
i
do
not
care
to
continue
to
do
so
any
longer
having
the
conviction
that
i
economize
all
that
i
obtain
and
give
all
that
i
can
that
is
to
say
all
that
i
have
footnote
southey
of
vol
p
besides
these
methods
of
economy
the
eye
of
the
master
or
the
mistress
is
always
necessary
to
see
that
nothing
is
lost
that
everything
is
put
to
its
proper
use
and
kept
in
its
proper
place
and
that
all
things
are
done
decently
and
in
order
it
does
no
dishonour
to
even
the
highest
individuals
to
take
a
personal
interest
in
their
own
affairs
and
with
persons
of
moderate
means
the
necessity
for
the
eye
of
the
master
overlooking
everything
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
proper
conduct
of
business
it
is
difficult
to
fix
the
precise
limits
of
economy
bacon
says
that
if
a
man
would
live
well
within
his
income
he
ought
not
to
expend
more
than
and
save
the
rest
this
is
perhaps
too
exacting
and
bacon
himself
did
not
follow
his
own
advice
what
proportion
of
income
should
be
expended
on
rent
that
depends
upon
circumstances
in
the
country
about
in
london
about
it
is
at
all
events
better
to
save
too
much
than
spend
too
much
one
may
remedy
the
first
defect
but
not
so
easily
the
latter
wherever
there
is
a
large
family
the
more
money
that
is
put
to
one
side
and
saved
the
better
economy
is
necessary
to
the
moderately
rich
as
well
as
to
the
comparatively
poor
man
without
economy
a
man
can
not
be
generous
he
can
not
take
part
in
the
charitable
work
of
the
world
if
he
spends
all
that
he
earns
he
can
help
nobody
he
can
not
properly
educate
his
children
nor
put
them
in
the
way
of
starting
fairly
in
the
business
of
life
even
the
example
of
bacon
shows
that
the
loftiest
intelligence
can
not
neglect
thrift
without
peril
but
thousands
of
witnesses
daily
testify
that
men
even
of
the
most
moderate
intelligence
can
practise
the
virtue
with
success
although
englishmen
are
a
diligent
and
generally
race
trusting
to
themselves
and
their
own
efforts
for
their
sustenance
and
advancement
in
the
world
they
are
yet
liable
to
overlook
and
neglect
some
of
the
best
practical
methods
of
improving
their
position
and
securing
their
social
they
are
not
yet
sufficiently
educated
to
be
temperate
provident
and
foreseeing
they
live
for
the
present
and
are
too
regardless
of
the
coming
time
men
who
are
husbands
and
parents
generally
think
they
do
their
duty
if
they
provide
for
the
hour
that
is
neglectful
of
the
hour
that
is
to
come
though
industrious
they
are
improvident
though
they
are
spendthrift
they
do
not
exercise
forethought
enough
and
are
defective
in
the
virtue
of
prudent
economy
men
of
all
classes
are
as
yet
too
little
influenced
by
these
considerations
they
are
apt
to
live
beyond
their
incomes
at
all
events
to
live
up
to
them
the
upper
classes
live
too
much
for
display
they
must
keep
up
their
position
in
society
they
must
have
fine
houses
horses
and
carriages
give
good
dinners
and
drink
rich
wines
their
ladies
must
wear
costly
and
gay
dresses
thus
the
march
of
improvidence
goes
on
over
broken
hearts
ruined
hopes
and
wasted
ambitions
the
vice
descends
in
society
the
middle
classes
strive
to
ape
the
patrician
orders
they
flourish
crests
liveries
and
hammercloths
their
daughters
must
learn
accomplishments
see
society
ride
and
drive
frequent
operas
and
theatres
display
is
the
rage
ambition
rivalling
ambition
and
thus
the
vicious
folly
rolls
on
like
a
tide
the
vice
again
descends
the
working
classes
too
live
up
to
their
means
much
smaller
means
it
is
true
but
even
when
they
are
able
they
are
not
sufficiently
careful
to
provide
against
the
evil
day
and
then
only
the
poorhouse
offers
its
scanty
aid
to
protect
them
against
want
to
save
money
for
avaricious
purposes
is
altogether
different
from
saving
it
for
economical
purposes
the
saving
may
be
accomplished
in
the
same
manner
by
wasting
nothing
and
saving
everything
but
here
the
comparison
ends
the
miser
only
pleasure
is
in
saving
the
prudent
economist
spends
what
he
can
afford
for
comfort
and
enjoyment
and
saves
a
surplus
for
some
future
time
the
avaricious
person
makes
gold
his
idol
it
is
his
molten
calf
before
which
he
constantly
bows
down
whereas
the
thrifty
person
regards
it
as
a
useful
instrument
and
as
a
means
of
promoting
his
own
happiness
and
the
happiness
of
those
who
are
dependent
upon
him
the
miser
is
never
satisfied
he
amasses
wealth
that
he
can
never
consume
but
leaves
it
to
be
squandered
by
others
probably
by
spendthrifts
whereas
the
economist
aims
at
securing
a
fair
share
of
the
world
wealth
and
comfort
without
any
thought
of
amassing
a
fortune
it
is
the
duty
of
all
persons
to
economize
their
means
of
the
young
as
well
as
of
the
old
the
duke
of
sully
mentions
in
his
memoirs
that
nothing
contributed
more
to
his
fortune
than
the
prudent
economy
which
he
practised
even
in
his
youth
of
always
preserving
some
ready
money
in
hand
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
circumstances
of
emergency
is
a
man
married
then
the
duty
of
economy
is
still
more
binding
his
wife
and
children
plead
to
him
most
eloquently
are
they
in
the
event
of
his
early
death
to
be
left
to
buffet
with
the
world
unaided
the
hand
of
charity
is
cold
the
gifts
of
charity
are
valueless
compared
with
the
gains
of
industry
and
the
honest
savings
of
frugal
labour
which
carry
with
them
blessings
and
comforts
without
inflicting
any
wound
upon
the
feelings
of
the
helpless
and
bereaved
let
every
man
therefore
who
can
endeavour
to
economize
and
to
save
not
to
hoard
but
to
nurse
his
little
savings
for
the
sake
of
promoting
the
welfare
and
happiness
of
himself
while
here
and
of
others
when
he
has
departed
there
is
a
dignity
in
the
very
effort
to
save
with
a
worthy
purpose
even
though
the
attempt
should
not
be
crowned
with
eventual
success
it
produces
a
mind
it
gives
prudence
a
triumph
over
extravagance
it
gives
virtue
the
mastery
over
vice
it
puts
the
passions
under
control
it
drives
away
care
it
secures
comfort
saved
money
however
little
will
serve
to
dry
up
many
a
tear
will
ward
off
many
sorrows
and
heartburnings
which
otherwise
might
prey
upon
us
possessed
of
a
little
store
of
capital
a
man
walks
with
a
lighter
step
his
heart
beats
more
cheerily
when
interruption
of
work
or
adversity
happens
he
can
meet
them
he
can
recline
on
his
capital
which
will
either
break
his
fall
or
prevent
it
altogether
by
prudential
economy
we
can
realize
the
dignity
of
man
life
will
be
a
blessing
and
old
age
an
honour
we
can
ultimately
under
a
kind
providence
surrender
life
conscious
that
we
have
been
no
burden
upon
society
but
rather
perhaps
an
acquisition
and
ornament
to
it
conscious
also
that
as
we
have
been
independent
our
children
after
us
by
following
our
example
and
availing
themselves
of
the
means
we
have
left
behind
us
will
walk
in
like
manner
through
the
world
in
happiness
and
independence
every
man
first
duty
is
to
improve
to
educate
and
elevate
himself
helping
forward
his
brethren
at
the
same
time
by
all
reasonable
methods
each
has
within
himself
the
capability
of
free
will
and
free
action
to
a
large
extent
and
the
fact
is
proved
by
the
multitude
of
men
who
have
successfully
battled
with
and
overcome
the
adverse
circumstances
of
life
in
which
they
have
been
placed
and
who
have
risen
from
the
lowest
depths
of
poverty
and
social
debasement
as
if
to
prove
what
energetic
man
resolute
of
purpose
can
do
for
his
own
elevation
progress
and
advancement
in
the
world
is
it
not
a
fact
that
the
greatness
of
humanity
the
glory
of
communities
the
power
of
nations
are
the
result
of
trials
and
difficulties
encountered
and
overcome
let
a
man
resolve
and
determine
that
he
will
advance
and
the
first
step
of
advancement
is
already
made
the
first
step
is
half
the
battle
in
the
very
fact
of
advancing
himself
he
is
in
the
most
effectual
possible
way
advancing
others
he
is
giving
them
the
most
eloquent
of
all
lessons
that
of
example
which
teaches
far
more
emphatically
than
words
can
teach
he
is
doing
what
others
are
by
imitation
incited
to
do
beginning
with
himself
he
is
in
the
most
emphatic
manner
teaching
the
duty
of
and
of
and
if
the
majority
of
men
acted
as
he
did
how
much
wiser
how
much
happier
how
much
more
prosperous
as
a
whole
would
society
become
for
society
being
made
up
of
units
will
be
happy
and
prosperous
or
the
reverse
exactly
in
the
same
degree
as
the
respective
individuals
who
compose
it
complaints
about
the
inequality
of
conditions
are
as
old
as
the
world
in
the
economy
of
xenophon
socrates
asks
how
is
it
that
some
men
live
in
abundance
and
have
something
to
spare
whilst
others
can
scarcely
obtain
the
necessaries
of
life
and
at
the
same
time
run
into
debt
the
reason
is
replied
isomachus
because
the
former
occupy
themselves
with
their
business
whilst
the
latter
neglect
it
the
difference
between
men
consists
for
the
most
part
in
intelligence
conduct
and
energy
the
best
character
never
works
by
chance
but
is
under
the
influence
of
virtue
prudence
and
forethought
there
are
of
course
many
failures
in
the
world
the
man
who
looks
to
others
for
help
instead
of
relying
on
himself
will
fail
the
man
who
is
undergoing
the
process
of
perpetual
waste
will
fail
the
miser
the
scrub
the
extravagant
the
thriftless
will
necessarily
fail
indeed
most
people
fail
because
they
do
not
deserve
to
succeed
they
set
about
their
work
in
the
wrong
way
and
no
amount
of
experience
seems
to
improve
them
there
is
not
so
much
in
luck
as
some
people
profess
to
believe
luck
is
only
another
word
for
good
management
in
practical
affairs
richelieu
used
to
say
that
he
would
not
continue
to
employ
an
unlucky
man
in
other
words
a
man
wanting
in
practical
qualities
and
unable
to
profit
by
experience
for
failures
in
the
past
are
very
often
the
auguries
of
failures
in
the
future
some
of
the
best
and
ablest
of
men
are
wanting
in
tact
they
will
neither
make
allowance
for
circumstances
nor
adapt
themselves
to
circumstances
they
will
insist
on
trying
to
drive
their
wedge
the
broad
end
foremost
they
raise
walls
only
to
run
their
own
heads
against
they
make
such
great
preparations
and
use
such
great
precautions
that
they
defeat
their
own
object
like
the
dutchman
mentioned
by
washington
irving
who
having
to
leap
a
ditch
went
so
far
back
to
have
a
good
run
at
it
that
when
he
came
up
he
was
completely
winded
and
had
to
sit
down
on
the
wrong
side
to
recover
his
breath
in
actual
life
we
want
things
done
not
preparations
for
doing
them
and
we
naturally
prefer
the
man
who
has
definite
aims
and
purposes
and
proceeds
in
the
straightest
and
shortest
way
to
accomplish
his
object
to
the
one
who
describes
the
thing
to
be
done
and
spins
fine
phrases
about
doing
it
without
action
words
are
mere
maundering
the
desire
for
success
in
the
world
and
even
for
the
accumulation
of
money
is
not
without
its
uses
it
has
doubtless
been
implanted
in
the
human
heart
for
good
rather
than
for
evil
purposes
indeed
the
desire
to
accumulate
forms
one
of
the
most
powerful
instruments
for
the
regeneration
of
society
it
provides
the
basis
for
individual
energy
and
activity
it
is
the
beginning
of
maritime
and
commercial
enterprise
it
is
the
foundation
of
industry
as
well
as
of
independence
it
impels
men
to
labour
to
invent
and
to
excel
no
idle
nor
thriftless
man
ever
became
great
it
is
amongst
those
who
never
lost
a
moment
that
we
find
the
men
who
have
moved
and
advanced
the
world
by
their
learning
their
science
or
their
inventions
labour
of
some
sort
is
one
of
the
conditions
of
existence
the
thought
has
come
down
to
us
from
pagan
times
that
labour
is
the
price
which
the
gods
have
set
upon
all
that
is
excellent
the
thought
is
also
worthy
of
christian
times
everything
depends
as
we
shall
afterwards
find
upon
the
uses
to
which
accumulations
of
wealth
are
applied
on
the
tombstone
of
john
donough
of
new
orleans
the
following
maxims
are
engraved
as
the
guide
to
young
men
on
their
way
through
life
remember
always
that
labour
is
one
of
the
conditions
of
our
existence
time
is
gold
throw
not
one
minute
away
but
place
each
one
to
account
do
unto
all
men
as
you
would
be
done
by
never
put
off
till
what
can
be
done
never
bid
another
do
what
you
can
do
yourself
never
covet
what
is
not
your
own
never
think
any
matter
so
trifling
as
not
to
deserve
notice
never
give
out
what
does
not
come
in
do
not
spend
but
produce
let
the
greatest
order
regulate
the
actions
of
your
life
study
in
your
course
of
life
to
do
the
greatest
amount
of
good
deprive
yourself
of
nothing
that
is
necessary
to
your
comfort
but
live
in
honourable
simplicity
and
frugality
labour
then
to
the
last
moment
of
your
existence
most
men
have
it
in
their
power
by
prudent
arrangements
to
defend
themselves
against
adversity
and
to
throw
up
a
barrier
against
destitution
they
can
do
this
by
their
own
individual
efforts
or
by
acting
on
the
principle
of
which
is
capable
of
an
almost
indefinite
extension
people
of
the
most
humble
condition
by
combining
their
means
and
associating
together
are
enabled
in
many
ways
to
defend
themselves
against
the
pressure
of
poverty
to
promote
their
physical
and
even
to
advance
the
progress
of
the
nation
a
solitary
individual
may
be
able
to
do
very
little
to
advance
and
improve
society
but
when
he
combines
with
his
fellows
for
the
purpose
he
can
do
a
very
great
deal
civilization
itself
is
but
the
effect
of
combining
mill
has
said
that
almost
all
the
advantages
which
man
possesses
over
the
inferior
animals
arise
from
his
power
of
acting
in
combination
with
his
fellows
and
of
accomplishing
by
the
united
efforts
of
numbers
what
could
not
be
accomplished
by
the
detached
efforts
of
individuals
the
secret
of
social
development
is
to
be
found
in
and
the
great
question
of
improved
economical
and
social
life
can
only
receive
a
satisfactory
solution
through
its
means
to
effect
good
on
a
large
scale
men
must
combine
their
efforts
and
the
best
social
system
is
that
in
which
the
organization
for
the
common
good
is
rendered
the
most
complete
in
all
respects
the
middle
classes
have
largely
employed
the
principle
of
association
no
class
has
risen
so
rapidly
or
done
more
by
their
energy
and
industry
to
advance
the
power
and
progress
of
england
and
why
because
the
most
active
have
always
been
the
most
ready
to
associate
to
and
to
combine
they
have
combined
when
they
were
attacked
combined
when
they
had
an
abuse
to
destroy
or
a
great
object
to
accomplish
they
have
associated
together
to
manufacture
articles
of
commerce
to
make
canals
to
construct
railways
to
form
gas
companies
to
institute
insurance
and
banking
companies
and
to
do
an
immense
amount
of
industrial
work
by
combining
their
small
capitals
together
they
have
been
able
to
accumulate
an
enormous
aggregate
capital
and
to
execute
the
most
gigantic
undertakings
the
middle
classes
have
accomplished
more
by
the
principle
of
than
the
classes
who
have
so
much
greater
need
of
it
all
the
joint
stock
companies
are
the
result
of
association
the
railways
the
telegraphs
the
banks
the
mines
the
manufactories
have
for
the
most
part
been
established
and
are
carried
on
by
means
of
the
savings
of
the
middle
classes
the
working
classes
have
only
begun
to
employ
the
same
principle
yet
how
much
might
they
accomplish
by
its
means
they
might
in
saving
as
well
as
in
producing
they
might
by
putting
their
saved
earnings
together
become
by
combination
their
own
masters
within
a
few
years
past
many
millions
sterling
have
been
expended
in
strikes
for
wages
a
hundred
millions
a
year
are
thrown
away
upon
drink
and
other
unnecessary
articles
here
is
an
enormous
capital
men
who
expend
or
waste
such
an
amount
can
easily
become
capitalists
it
requires
only
will
energy
and
so
much
money
spent
on
buildings
plant
and
would
enable
them
to
manufacture
for
themselves
instead
of
for
the
benefit
of
individual
capitalists
the
is
impartial
in
its
services
it
is
no
respecter
of
persons
it
will
work
for
the
benefit
of
the
labourer
as
well
as
for
the
benefit
of
the
millionaire
it
will
work
for
those
who
make
the
best
use
of
it
and
who
have
the
greatest
knowledge
of
its
powers
the
greater
number
of
workmen
possess
little
capital
save
their
labour
and
as
we
have
already
seen
many
of
them
uselessly
and
wastefully
spend
most
of
their
earnings
instead
of
saving
them
and
becoming
capitalists
by
combining
in
large
numbers
for
the
purposes
of
economical
working
they
might
easily
become
capitalists
and
operate
upon
a
large
scale
as
society
is
now
constituted
every
man
is
not
only
justified
but
bound
in
duty
as
a
citizen
to
accumulate
his
earnings
by
all
fair
and
honourable
methods
with
the
view
of
securing
a
position
of
ultimate
competence
and
independence
we
do
not
say
that
men
should
save
and
hoard
their
gains
for
the
mere
sake
of
saving
and
hoarding
this
would
be
parsimony
and
avarice
but
we
do
say
that
all
men
ought
to
aim
at
accumulating
a
sufficiency
enough
to
maintain
them
in
comfort
during
the
helpless
years
that
are
to
come
to
maintain
them
in
times
of
sickness
and
of
sorrow
and
in
old
age
which
if
it
does
come
ought
to
find
them
with
a
little
store
of
capital
in
hand
sufficient
to

the

it
sometimes
takes
the
form
of
unions
against

displays
itself
in
the
strikes
that
are
so
common

usually
so

the
equitable

society
was
established
in

at
a
time
when
trade
was
in
a
very
bad
condition
and
working
people
generally
were
heartless
and
hopeless
as
to
their
future
state
some
or
thirty
men
mostly
flannel
weavers
met
and
formed
themselves
into
a
society
for
the
purpose
of
economizing
their
earnings

is
pretty
well
known

into
the
pockets
of
the
shopkeepers
the
weekly
subscription
was
twopence

when
about
calls
of

had
been
made
they
found
that
they
were
able
to
buy
a
sack
of
oatmeal
which
they
distributed
at
amongst
the
members
of

society
the
number
of
members
grew
and
the

so
increased

the
society
was
enabled
to
buy
tea
sugar
and
other
articles
and
distribute
them
amongst

superseded

and
became
their

insisted
from
the
first
on

established

the
issue
of
shares
and
began
to
make

also
sold
drapery

the
principal
trade
consisted
in

and
notwithstanding
the
great
distress
during

period
of

continued
to
prosper
from

set
apart
a
portion
of
its
funds
for
educational
purposes
and
established
a
and
a
library
which
now
contains
over
six
thousand

continued
to
increase
until
it
possessed
eleven
branches

exercise
a

it
has
been

done
more
to

kind
or
another
these
societies
have
promoted
habits
of
saving
of
thrift
and
of
temperance
they
have
given
the
people
an
interest
in
money
matters
and
enabled

one
of
the
most
flourishing
societies
is
that
established

the

the

is
used

lectures
concerts
and

there
are
six
branches
of
the
society
established
in
different
parts
of

a
large
amount
of
business
is
done
and
the
profits
are
very
considerable
these
are
divided
amongst

in

to
the
purchases
made
by
them
the
profits
are
for
the
most
part
in
and
collieries
in
the
neighbourhood
of
darwen
one
of
the
most
praiseworthy
features
of
the
society
is
the
provision
made
for
the
free
education
of
the
members
and
their
families
two
and
a
half
per
cent
of
the
profits
are
appropriated
for
the
purpose
while
inspecting
the
institution
a
few
months
ago
we
were
informed
that
the
science
classes
were
so
efficiently
conducted
that
one
of
the
pupils
had
just
obtained
a
government
scholarship
of
fifty
pounds
a
year
for
three
years
including
free
instruction
at
the
school
of
mines
jermyn

london
with
a
free
use
of
the
laboratories
during
that
period
there
are
also
two
other
institutions
in
the
same
place
and
we
were
informed
that
the
working
people
of
darwen
are
for
the
most
part
sober
and
thrifty
the
example
has
also
spread
into
scotland
and
the
south
of
england
at
northampton
a
society
exists
for
the
purpose
of
buying
and

the
securities
and
facilities
of
a
bank
with
the
profits

the
business
by
which
they
mostly
thrive
is
by
the
purchase
and
sale
of
food
provisions
groceries
draperies
and
other
articles
with
the
exception
of
intoxicating
liquors
the
sole
secret
of
their
success
consists
in
ready
money
they
give
no
credit
everything
is
done
for
cash
the
profit
of
the
trade
being
divided
amongst
the
members
every
business
man
knows
that
cash
payment
is
the
soundest
method
of
conducting
business
the
rochdale
pioneers
having
discovered
the
secret
have
spread
it
amongst
their
class
in
their
advice
to
members
of
this
and
other
societies
they
say
look
well
after
money
matters
buy
your
goods
as
much
as
possible
in
the
first
markets
or
if
you
have
the
produce
of
your
industry
to
sell
contrive
if
possible
to
sell
it
in
the
last
never
depart
from
the
principle
of
buying
and
selling
for
ready
money
beware
of
long
reckonings
in
short
the
societies
became
tradesmen
on
a
large
scale
and
besides
the
pureness
of
the
food
sold
their
profit
consisted
in
the
discount
for
cash
payments
which
was
divided
amongst
the
members
land
and
building
societies
constitute
another
form
of
these
are
chiefly
supported
by
the
minor
men
but
also
to
a
considerable
extent
by
the
skilled
and
thrifty
men
by
their
means
portions
of
land
are
bought
and
are
built
by
means
of
a
building
society
a
person
who
desires
to
possess
a
house
enters
the
society
as
a
member
and
instead
of
paying
his
rent
to
the
landlord
pays
his
subscriptions
and
interest
to
a
committee
of
his
friends
and
in
course
of
time
when
his
subscriptions
are
paid
up
the
house
is
purchased
and
conveyed
to
him
by
the
society
the
is
thus
a
savings
bank
where
money
accumulates
for
a
certain
purpose
but
even
those
who
do
not
purchase
a
house
receive
a
dividend
and
bonus
on
their
shares
which
sometimes
amounts
to
a
considerable
sum
the
accumulation
of
property
has
the
effect
which
it
always
has
upon
thrifty
men
it
makes
them
steady
sober
and
diligent
it
weans
them
from
revolutionary
notions
and
makes
them
conservative
when
workmen
by
their
industry
and
frugality
have
secured
their
own
independence
they
will
cease
to
regard
the
sight
of
others
as
a
wrong
inflicted
on
themselves
and
it
will
no
longer
be
possible
to
make
political
capital
out
of
their
imaginary
woes
it
has
been
said
that
freehold
land
societies
which
were
established
for
political
objects
had
the
effect
of
weaning
men
from
political
reform
they
were
first
started
in
birmingham
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
men
to
buy
land
and
divide
it
into
freeholds
so
that
the
owners
might
become
electors
and
vote
against
the
the
have
been
done
away
with
but
the
holders
of
freehold
land
still
exist
though
many
of
them
have
ceased
to
be
politicians
arthur
ryland
informs
me
said
holyoake
in
a
recent
paper
on
building
societies
that
in
birmingham
numbers
of
persons
under
the
influence
of
these
societies
have
forsaken
patriotism
for
profits
and
i
know
both
and
chartists
who
were
for
social
and
political
reform
who
now
care
no
more
for
it
than
a
whig
government
and
decline
to
attend
a
public
meeting
on
a
fine
night
while
they
would
crawl
like
the
serpent
in
eden
through
a
gutter
in
a
storm
after
a
good
security
they
have
tasted
land
and
the
gravel
has
got
into
their
souls
yet
to
many
others
he
adds
these
societies
have
taught
a
healthy
frugality
they
never
else
would
have
known
and
enabled
many
an
industrious
son
to

the

misery
of
old
age
is
often
but
the
extract
of
our
past
life
two
other
methods
of
saving
remain
to
be
mentioned
the
first
is
by
life
assurance
which
enables
widows
and
children
to
be
provided
for
at
the
death
of
the
assured
and
the
second
is
by
friendly
societies
which
enable
working
men
to
provide
themselves
with
relief
in
sickness
and
their
widows
and
orphans
with
a
small
sum
at
their
death
the
first
method
is
practised
by
the
middle
and
upper
classes
and
the
second
by
the
working
classes
it
might
possibly
take
a
long
time
to
save
enough
money
to
provide
for
those
who
are
dependent
upon
us
and
there
is
always
the
temptation
to
encroach
upon
the
funds
set
apart
for
death
which
as
most
people
suppose
may
be
a
event
so
that
saving
bit
by
bit
from
week
to
week
can
not
always
be
relied
upon
the
person
who
joins
an
assurance
society
is
in
a
different
position
his
annual
or
quarterly
saving
becomes
at
once
a
portion
of
a
general
fund
sufficient
to
realize
the
intention
of
the
assured
at
the
moment
that
he
makes
his
first
payment
his
object
is
attained
though
he
die
on
the
day
after
his
premium
has
been
paid
his
widow
and
children
will
receive
the
entire
amount
of
his
assurance
this
system
while
it
secures
a
provision
to
his
survivors
at
the
same
time
incites
a
man
to
the
moral
obligation
of
exorcising
foresight
and
prudence
since
through
its
means
these
virtues
may
be
practised
and
their
ultimate
reward
secured
not
the
least
of
the
advantages
attending
life
assurance
is
the
serenity
of
mind
which
attends
the
provident
man
when
lying
on
a
bed
of
sickness
or
when
he
is
in
prospect
of
death
so
unlike
that
painful
anxiety
for
the
future
welfare
of
a
family
which
adds
poignancy
to
bodily
suffering
and
retards
or
defeats
the
power
of
medicine
the
poet
burns
in

to
a

a
few
days

enough
of
this
half
my
life
assurance
may
be
described
as
a
plan
for
securing
widows
and
children
from
want
it
is
an
arrangement
by
means
of
which
a
large
number
of
persons
agree
to
lay
by
certain
small
sums
called
premiums
yearly
to
accumulate
at
interest
as
in
a
savings
bank
against
the
contingency
of
the
assurer
death
when
the
amount
of
the
sum
subscribed
for
is
forthwith
handed
over
to
his
survivors
by
this
means
persons
possessed
of
but
little
capital
though
enjoying
regular
wages
or
salaries
however
small
may
at
once
form
a
fund
for
the
benefit
of
their
family
at
death
we
often
hear
of
men
who
have
been
diligent
and
useful
members
of
society
dying
and
leaving
their
wives
and
families
in
absolute
poverty
they
have
lived
in
respectable
style
paid
high
rents
for
their
houses
dressed
well
kept
up
good
visiting
acquaintance
were
seen
at
most
places
of
amusement
and
brought
up
their
children
with
certain
ideas
of
social
position
and
respectability
but
death
has
stricken
them
down
and
what
is
the
situation
of
their
families
has
the
father
provided
for
their
future
from
twenty
to
pounds
a
year
paid
into
an
assurance
society
would
have
secured
their
widows
and
orphans
against
absolute
want
have
they
performed
this
duty
no
they
have
done
nothing
of
the
kind
it
turns
out
that
the
family
have
been
living
up
to
their
means
if
not
beyond
them
and
the
issue
is
that
they
are
thrown
suddenly
bankrupt
upon
the
world
conduct
such
as
this
is
not
only
thoughtless
and
improvident
but
heartless
and
cruel
in
the
last
degree
to
bring
a
family
into
the
world
give
them
refined
tastes
and
accustom
them
to
comforts
the
loss
of
which
is
misery
and
then
to
leave
the
family
to
the
workhouse
the
prison
or
the
street
to
the
alms
of
relatives
or
to
the
charity
of
the
public
is
nothing
short
of
a
crime
done
against
society
as
well
as
against
the
unfortunate
individuals
who
are
the
immediate
sufferers
it
will
be
admitted
that
the
number
of
men
who
can
lay
by
a
sufficient
store
of
capital
for
the
benefit
of
their
families
is
in
these
times
of
intense
competition
comparatively
small
perhaps
the
claims
of
an
increasing
family
absorb
nearly
all
their
gains
and
they
find
that
the
sum
which
they
can
put
away
in
the
bank
is
so
small
that
it
is
not
put
away
at
all
they
become
reckless
of
ever
attaining
so
apparently
hopeless
an
object
as
that
of
an
accumulation
of
savings
for
the
benefit
of
their
families
at
death
take
the
case
of
a
married
man
with
a
family
he
has
begun
business
and
thinks
that
if
his
life
were
spared
he
might
in
course
of
years
be
able
to
lay
by
sufficient
savings
to
provide
for
his
wife
and
family
at
his
death
but
life
is
most
uncertain
and
he
knows
that
at
any
moment
he
may
be
taken
away
leaving
those
he
holds
most
dear
comparatively
destitute
at
thirty
he
determines
to
join
a
sound
life
office
he
insures
for
five
hundred
pounds
payable
to
his
survivors
at
his
death
and
pays
from
twelve
to
thirteen
pounds
yearly
from
the
moment
on
which
he
pays
that
amount
the
five
hundred
pounds
are
secured
for
his
family
although
he
died
the
very
next
day
now
if
he
had
deposited
this
twelve
or
thirteen
pounds
yearly
in
a
bank
or
employed
it
at
interest
it
would
have
taken
about
twenty
years
before
his
savings
would
have
amounted
to
five
hundred
pounds
but
by
the
simple
and
beautiful
expedient
of
life
assurance
these
years
of
the
best
part
of
his
life
are
on
this
account
at
least
secured
against
anxiety
and
care
the
anticipation
of
future
evil
no
longer
robs
him
of
present
enjoyment
by
means
of
his
annual
fixed
payment
which
decreases
according
to
the
profits
of
the
society
he
is
secure
of
leaving
a
fixed
sum
at
his
death
for
the
benefit
of
his
family
in
this
way
life
assurance
may
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
contract
by
which
the
inequalities
of
life
are
to
a
certain
extent
averaged
and
compensated
so
that
those
who
die
soon
or
rather
their
families
become
sharers
in
the
good
fortune
of
those
who
live
beyond
the
average
term
of
life
and
even
should
the
assurer
himself
live
beyond
the
period
at
which
his
savings
would
have
accumulated
to
more
than
the
sum
insured
he
will
not
be
disposed
to
repine
if
he
takes
into
account
his
exemption
from
corroding
solicitude
during
so
many
years
of
his
life
the
reasons
which
induce
a
man
to
insure
his
house
and
stock
of
goods
against
the
accident
of
fire
ought
to
be
still
more
imperative
in
inducing
him
to
insure
his
life
against
the
accident
of
disease
and
the
contingency
of
sudden
death
what
is
worldly
prudence
in
the
one
case
is
something
more
in
the
other
it
has
superadded
to
it
the
duty
of
providing
for
the
future
maintenance
of
a
possibly
widowed
wife
and
orphaned
children
and
no
man
can
justly
stand
excused
who
neglects
so
great
and
binding
an
obligation
is
it
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
a
husband
and
father
to
provide
daily
bread
for
his
wife
and
children
during
his
life
then
it
is
equally
an
obligation
on
his
part
to
provide
means
for
their
adequate
support
in
event
of
his
death
the
duty
is
so
obvious
the
means
of
performing
it
are
so
simple
and
are
now
so
easily
placed
within
the
reach
of
all
men
the
arrangement
is
so
eminently
practical
rational
benevolent
and
just
it
is
moreover
so
calculated
to
increase
every
wise
and
prudent
man
sense
of
and
to
encourage
him
in
the
performance
of
all
proper
social
duties
that
we
can
not
conceive
of
any
possible
objection
that
can
be
urged
against
it
and
it
is
only
to
be
regretted
that
the
practice
is
not
far
more
general
and
customary
than
it
is
amongst
all
classes
of
the
community
footnote
it
may
be
mentioned
that
the
total
amount
assured
in
existing
british
offices
mostly
by
the
middle
classes
is
about
three
hundred
and
fifty
millions
sterling
and
that
the
annual
premiums
payable
amount
to
not
less
than
eleven
millions
sterling
and
yet
no
more
than
one
person
in
twenty
of
the
persons
belonging
to
the
classes
to
whom
life
assurance
is
especially
applicable
have
yet
availed
themselves
of
its
benefits
the
friendly
or
benefit
societies
of
the
working
classes
are
also
societies
under
another
form
they
cultivate
the
habit
of
prudent
amongst
the
people
and
are
consequently
worthy
of
every
encouragement
it
is
certainly
a
striking
fact
that
some
four
millions
of
working
men
should
have
organized
themselves
into
voluntary
associations
for
the
purpose
of
mutual
support
in
time
of
sickness
and
distress
these
societies
are
the
outgrowth
in
a
great
measure
of
the
english
love
of
and
social
independence
in
illustration
of
which
it
maybe
stated
that
whereas
in
france
only
one
person
in
is
found
belonging
to
a
benefit
society
and
in
belgium
one
in
the
proportion
in
england
is
found
to
be
one
in
nine
the
english
societies
are
said
to
have
in
hand
funds
amounting
to
more
than
eleven
millions
sterling
and
they
distribute
relief
amongst
their
members
provided
by
voluntary
contributions
out
of
their
weekly
earnings
amounting
to
above
two
millions
yearly
although
the
working
classes
of
france
and
belgium
do
not
belong
to
benefit
societies
to
anything
like
the
same
extent
it
must
be
stated
in
their
justification
that
they
are
amongst
the
most
thrifty
and
prudent
people
in
the
world
they
invest
their
savings
principally
in
land
and
in
the
public
funds
the
french
and
belgians
have
a
positive
hunger
for
land
they
save
everything
that
they
can
for
the
purpose
of
acquiring
more
and
with
respect
to
their
investments
in
the
public
funds
it
may
be
mentioned
as
a
fact
that
it
was
the
french
peasantry
who
by
investing
their
savings
in
the
national
defence
loan
liberated
french
soil
from
the
tread
of
their
german
conquerors
footnote
at
the
present
time
one
individual
out
of
every
eight
in
the
population
of
france
has
a
share
in
the
national
debt
the
average
amount
held
being
francs
the
participants
in
the
debt
approach
closely
to
the
number
of
freeholders
or
rather
distinct
freeholdings
which
amount
to
according
to
the
last
return
france
certainly
furnishes
a
singular
exception
to
those
countries
of
central
and
western
europe
where
the
rich
are
getting
more
rich
and
the
poor
ever
more
poor

france
wealth
becomes
more
and
more
distributed
among
the
bulk
of
the
population
english
benefit
societies
notwithstanding
their
great
uses
and
benefits
have
numerous
defects
there
are
faults
in
the
details
of
their
organization
and
management
whilst
many
of
them
are
financially
unsound
like
other
institutions
in
their
early
stages
they
have
been
tentative
and
in
a
great
measure
empirical
more
especially
as
regards
their
rates
of
contribution
and
allowances
for
sick
relief
the
rates
have
in
many
cases
been
fixed
too
low
in
proportion
to
the
benefits
allowed
and
hence
the
box
is
often
declared
to
be
closed
after
the
money
subscribed
has
been
expended
the
society
then
comes
to
an
end
and
the
older
members
have
to
go
without
relief
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
but
life
assurance
societies
themselves
have
had
to
undergo
the
same
discipline
of
failure
and
the
operation
of
winding
up
has
not
unfrequently
thrown
discredit
upon
these
associations
to
quote
the
words
of
the
registrar
of
friendly
societies
in
a
recent
report
though
the
information
thus
far
obtained
is
not
very
encouraging
as
to
the
general
system
of
management
on
the
whole
perhaps
the
results
of
the
investments
of
the
poor
are
not
worse
than
those
which
noblemen
members
of
parliament
merchants
professed
financiers
and
speculators
have
contrived
to
attain
in
their
management
of
railways
banks
and
enterprises
of
all
kinds
the
workmen
societies
originated
for
the
most
part
in
a
common
want
felt
by
persons
of
small
means
unable
to
accumulate
any
considerable
store
of
savings
to
provide
against
destitution
in
the
event
of
disablement
by
disease
or
accident
at
the
beginning
of

persons
earning
their
bread
by
daily
labour
are
able
to
save
money
with
difficulty
unavoidable
expenses
absorb
their
limited
means
and
press
heavily
on
their
income
when
unable
to
work
any
little
store
they
may
have
accumulated
is
soon
spent
and
if
they
have
a
family
to
maintain
there
is
then
no
choice
before
them
but
destitution
begging
or
recourse
to
the
in
their
desire
to
avoid
either
of
these
alternatives
they
have
contrived
the
expedient
of
the
benefit
society
by
combining
and
putting
a
large
number
of
small
contributions
together
they
have
found
it
practicable
thus
to
provide
a
fund
sufficiently
large
to
meet
their
ordinary
requirements
during
sickness
the
means
by
which
this
is
accomplished
are
very
simple
each

contributes

allowance

societies

also
a
widows
and
orphans
fund
raised
in
like
manner
out
of
which
a
sum
is
paid
to
the
survivors
of
members
at
their
death
it
will
be
obvious
that
such
organizations
however
faulty
they
may
be
in
detail
can
not
fail
to
exercise
a
beneficial
influence
upon
society
at
large
the
fact
that
one
of
such

manchester

of
odd
fellows
numbers
about

a
million

members
possesses
a
funded
capital
amounting
to

distributes
in

and

in

striking
light
their
beneficial
action
upon
the
classes

whom
and
by
whom
they
have
been
established

their

at
a
comparatively
small

mutual
assurance
is
economy
in
its
most
economical
form
and
merely
presents
another
illustration
of
that
power
of
which
is
working
out
such
extraordinary
results
in
all
departments
of
society
and
is
in
fact
but
another
name
for
civilization
many
persons
object
to
friendly
societies
because
they
are
conducted
at
because
many
of
them
are
got
up
by
the
keepers
of
in
order
to
obtain
custom
from
the
members
and
because
in
their
fortnightly
meetings
to
pay
their
subscriptions
they
acquire
the
pernicious
habit
of
drinking
and
thus
waste
quite
as
much
as
they
save
the
friendly
societies
doubtless
rely
very
much
on
the
social
element
the
is
everybody
house
the
members
can
there
meet
together
talk
together
and
drink
together
it
is
extremely
probable
that
had
they
trusted
solely
to
the
sense
of
duty
the
duty
of
insuring
against
sickness
and
merely
required
the
members
to
pay
their
weekly
contributions
to
a
collector
very
few
societies
of
the
kind
would
have
remained
in
existence
in
a
large
number
of
cases
there
is
practically
no
choice
between
the
society
that
meets
at
a
and
none
at
all
it
so
happens
that
the
world
can
not
be
conducted
on
superfine
principles
to
most
men
and
especially
to
the
men
we
are
speaking
of
it
is
a
rough
working
world
conducted
on
common
principles
such
as
will
wear
to
some
it
may
seem
vulgar
to
associate
beer
tobacco
or
feasting
with
the
pure
and
simple
duty
of
effecting
an
insurance
against
disablement
by
sickness
but
the
world
we
live
in
is
vulgar
and
we
must
take
it
as
we
find
it
and
try
to
make
the
best
of
it
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
tendencies
to
pure
good
in
man
are
very
weak
and
need
much
helping
but
the
expedient
vulgar
though
it
be
of
attracting
him
through
his
appetite
for
meat
and
drink
to
perform
a
duty
to
himself
and
neighbours
is
by
no
means
confined
to
societies
of
working
men
there
is
scarcely
a
london
charity
or
institution
but
has
its
annual
dinner
for
the
purpose
of
attracting
subscribers
are
we
to
condemn
the
eighteenpenny
annual
dinner
of
the
poor
man
but
excuse
the
guinea
one
of
the
rich
a
vigorous
effort
was
made
by
akroyd
of
halifax
in
to
establish
a
provident
sick
society
and
penny
savings
bank
for
the
working
men
in
the
west
riding
of
yorkshire
an
organization
was
set
on
foot
with
these
objects
and
though
the
penny
bank
proved
a
complete
success
the
provident
society
proved
a
complete
failure
akroyd
thus
explains
the
causes
of
the
failure
we
found
the
ground
preoccupied
he
says
by
friendly
societies
especially
by
the
odd
fellows
druids
foresters
etc
and
against
their
principles
of
mutual
check
against
fraud
and
no
new
and
independent
society
can
compete
our
rates
were
also
of
necessity
much
higher
than
theirs
and
this
was
perhaps
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
our
failure
low
rates
of
contribution
have
been
the
principal
cause
of
the
failure
of
friendly
societies
it
was
of
course
natural
that
the
members
being
persons
of
limited
means
should
endeavour
to
secure
the
objects
of
their
organization
at
the
lowest
cost
they
therefore
fixed
their
rates
as
low
as
possible
and
as
the
results
proved
they
in
most
cases
fixed
them
low
so
long
as
the
societies
consisted
for
the
most
part
of
young
healthy
men
and
the
average
amount
of
sickness
remained
low
the
payments
made
seemed
ample
the
funds
accumulated
and
many
flattered
themselves
that
their
societies
were
in
a
prosperous
state
when
they
contained
the
sure
elements
of
decay
for
as
the
members
grew
older
their
average
liability
to
sickness
was
regularly
increasing
the
effects
of
increased
age
upon
the
solvency
of
benefit
clubs
soon
becoming
known
young
men
avoided
the
older
societies
and
preferred
setting
up
organizations
of
their
own
the
consequence
was
that
the
old
men
began
to
draw
upon
their
reserves
at
the
same
time
that
the
regular
contributions
fell
off
and
when
as
was
frequently
the
case
a
few
constantly
ailing
members
kept
pressing
upon
the
society
the
funds
were
at
length
exhausted
the
box
was
declared
to
be
closed
and
the
society
was
broken
up
the
real
injustice
was
done
to
the
younger
men
who
remained
in
the
society
after
paying
their
contributions
for
many
years
they
found
when
sickness
at
length
fell
upon
them
that
the
funds
had
been
exhausted
by
expenditure
for
superannuation
and
other
allowances
which
were
not
provided
for
by
the
rules
of
the
society
footnote
the
registrar
of
friendly
societies
in
his
report
for
states
that
from
to
the
number
of
societies
enrolled
and
certified
had
been
of
which
had
ceased
to
exist
the
causes
of
failure
in
most
cases
were
reported
to
be
inadequacy
of
the
rates
of
contribution
the
granting
of
pensions
as
well
as
sick
pay
and
no
increase
of
young
members
the
dissolution
of
a
society
however
is
frequently
effected
with
a
view
of
remodelling
it
and
starting
afresh
under
better
regulations
and
with
rates
of
premium
such
as
increased
knowledge
has
shown
to
be
necessary
for
the
risks
which
they
have
to
incur
even
the
best
of
the
benefit
societies
have
been
slow
to
learn
the
essential
importance
of
adequate
rates
of
contribution
to
enable
them
to
fulfil
their
obligations
and
ensure
their
continued
usefulness
as
well
as
solvency
the
defect
of
most
of
them
consists
in
their
trying
to
do
too
much
with
too
little
means
the
benefits
paid
out
are
too
high
for
the
rates
of
contribution
paid
in
those
who
come
first
are
served
but
those
who
come
late
too
often
find
an
empty
box
not
only
have
the
rates
of
payment
been
generally
fixed
too
low
but
there
has
been
little
or
no
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
members
men
advanced
in
years
and
of
fragile
health
are
often
admitted
on
the
same
terms
as
the
young
and
the
healthy
the
only
difference
being
in
the
rate
of
entry
money
even
young
lodges
which
start
with
inadequate
rates
instead
of
growing
stronger
gradually
grow
weaker
and
in
the
event
of
a
few
constantly
ailing
members
falling
upon
the
funds
they
soon
become
exhausted
and
the
lodge
becomes
bankrupt
and
is
broken
up
such
has
been
the
history
of
thousands
of
friendly
societies
doing
good
and
serving
a
useful
purpose
in
their
time
but
ephemeral
and
to
many
of
their
members
disappointing
and
even
deceptive
attempts
have
been
recently
made
more
especially
by
the
officers
of
the
manchester
unity
of
odd
fellows
to
improve
the
financial
condition
of
their
society
perhaps
the
best
proof
of
the
desire
that
exists
on
the
part
of
the
leading
minds
in
the
unity
to
bring
the
organization
into
a
state
of
financial
soundness
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
the
board
of
management
have
authorized
the
publication
of
the
best
of
all
data
for
future
guidance
namely
the
actual
sickness
experience
of
the
order
an
elaborate
series
of
tables
has
accordingly
been
prepared
and
published
for
their
information
by
ratcliffe
the
corresponding
secretary
at
an
expense
of
about
in
the
preface
to
the
last
edition
it
is
stated
that
this
sum
has
not
been
abstracted
from
the
funds
set
apart
for
relief
during
sickness
for
assurances
at
death
or
for
providing
for
necessitous
widows
and
orphans
but
from
the
management
funds
of
the
lodges
funds
which
being
generally
raised
by
direct
levy
on
the
members
are
not
therefore
readily
expended
without
careful
consideration
on
the
part
of
those
most
interested
in
the
character
and
welfare
of
their
cherished
institution
we
believe
that
time
and
experience
will
enable
the
leaders
of
friendly
societies
generally
to
improve
them
and
introduce
new
ameliorations
the
best
institutions
are
things
of
slow
growth
and
are
shaped
by
experience
which
includes
failures
as
well
as
successes
and
finally
they
require
age
to
strengthen
them
and
root
them
in
habit
the
rudest

by
working
men
for
mutual
help
in

independent
of

from
private

foundation
on
which
to
build
up
something
better
it
teaches
and
thus
cultivates
amongst
the
humblest
classes
habits
of
provident
economy
friendly
societies
began
their
operations
before
there
was
any
science
of
vital
statistics
to
guide
them
and
if
they
have
made
mistakes
in
mutual
assurance
they
have
not
stood
alone
looking
at
the
difficulties
they
have
had
to
encounter
they
are
entitled
to
be
judged

spirit

not
fail
to
produce
good
results
the
defects
which
are
mixed
up
with
them
are
to
be
regarded
as

the
transient

probably
of
too
speculative
a
character
to
afford
much

benefit
to
the
working
classes
and
it
seems
that
by
far
the
safer
course
for
them
to
pursue
in

such
as
the

is
by

there
may
be
less
chance
of

there
is
less
risk
of

what
is
laid
by
is
not

its

help
recognizing
in
money
the
means
of
life
the
means
of
comfort
the
means
of
maintaining
an
honest
independence
we
would
therefore
recommend
every
young
man
and
every
young
woman
to
begin
life
by
learning
to
save
to
lay
up
for
the
future
a
certain
portion
of
every
week
earnings
be
it
little
or
much
to
avoid
consuming
every
week
or
every
year
the
earnings
of
that
week
or
year
and
we
counsel
them
to
do
this
as
they
would
avoid
the
horrors
of
dependence
destitution
or
beggary
we
would
have
men
and
women
of
every
class
able
to
help
themselves
relying
upon
their
own
resources
upon
their
own
savings
for
it
is
a
true
saying
that
a
penny
in
the
purse
is
better
than
a
friend
at
court
the
first
penny
saved
is
a
step
in
the
world
the
fact
of
its
being
saved
and
laid
by
indicates
forethought
prudence
wisdom
it
may
be
the
germ
of
future
happiness
it
may
be
the
beginning
of
independence
cobbett
was
accustomed
to
scoff
at
the
bubble
of
savings
banks
alleging
that
it
was
an
insult
to
people
to
tell
them
that
they
had
anything
to
save
yet
the
extent
to
which
savings
banks
been
used
even
by
the
humblest
classes
proves
that
he
was
as
much
mistaken
in
this
as
he
was
in
many
of
the
views
which
he
maintained
there
are
thousands
of
persons
who
would
probably
never
have
thought
of
laying
by
a
penny
but
for
the
facility
of
the
savings
bank
it
would
have
seemed
so
useless
to
try
the
small
hoard
in
the
cupboard
was
too
ready
at
hand
and
would
have
become
dissipated
before
it
accumulated
to
any
amount
but
no
sooner
was
a
place
of
deposit
provided
where
sums
as
small
as
a
shilling
could
be
put
away
than
people
hastened
to
take
advantage
of
it
the
first
savings
bank
was
started
by
miss
priscilla
wakefield
in
the
parish
of
tottenham
middlesex
towards
the
close
of
last
century
her
object
being
mainly
to
stimulate
the
frugality
of
poor
children
the
experiment
proved
so
successful
that
in
the
rev
joseph
smith
of
wendon
commenced
a
plan
of
receiving
small
sums
from
his
parishioners
during
summer
and
returning
them
at
christmas
with
the
addition
of
as
a
stimulus
to
prudence
and
forethought
miss
wakefield
in
her
turn
followed
smith
example
and
in
extended
the
plan
of
her
charitable
bank
so
as
to
include
adult
labourers
female
servants
and
others
a
similar
institution
was
formed
at
bath
in
by
several
ladies
of
that
city
and
about
the
same
time
whitbread
proposed
to
parliament
the
formation
of
a
national
institution
in
the
nature
of
a
bank
for
the
use
and
advantage
of
the
labouring
classes
alone
but
nothing
came
of
his
proposal
it
was
not
until
the
rev
henry
duncan
the
minister
of
ruthwell
a
poor
parish
in
dumfriesshire
took
up
the
subject
that
the
system
may
be
said
to
have
become
fairly
inaugurated
the
inhabitants
of
that
parish
were
mostly
poor
cottagers
whose
average
wages
did
not
amount
to
more
than
eight
shillings
a
week
there
were
no
manufactures
in
the
district
nor
any
means
of
subsistence
for
the
population
except
what
was
derived
from
the
land
under
cultivation
and
the
landowners
were
for
the
most
part
it
seemed
a
very
unlikely
place
in
which
to
establish
a
bank
for
savings
where
the
poor
people
were
already
obliged
to
strain
every
nerve
to
earn
a
bare
living
to
provide
the
means
of
educating
their
children
for
however
small
his
income
the
scottish
peasant
almost
invariably
contrives
to
save
something
wherewith
to
send
his
children
to
school
and
to
pay
their
little
contributions
to
the
friendly
society
of
the
parish
nevertheless
the
minister
resolved
as
a
help
to
his
spiritual
instructions
to
try
the
experiment
not
many
labouring
men
may
apprehend
the
deep
arguments
of
the
religious
teacher
but
the
least
intelligent
can
appreciate
a
bit
of
practical
advice
that
tells
on
the
of
his
household
as
well
as
on
the
labourer
own
daily
comfort
and
duncan
knew
that
even
in
the
poorest
family
there
were
odds
and
ends
of
income
apt
to
be
frittered
away
in
unnecessary
expenditure
he
saw
some
thrifty
cottagers
using
the
expedient
of
a
cow
or
a
pig
or
a
bit
of
as
a
savings
bank
finding
their
return
of
interest
in
the
shape
of
butter
and
milk
winter
bacon
or
garden
produce
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
there
were
other
villagers
single
men
and
young
women
for
whom
some
analogous
mode
of
storing
away
their
summer
savings
might
be
provided
and
a
fair
rate
of
interest
returned
upon
their
little
investments
hence
originated
the
parish
savings
bank
of
ruthwell
the
first
institution
of
the
kind
established
in
this
country
that
the
minister
was
not
wrong
in
his
anticipations
was
proved
by
the
fact
that
in
the
course
of
four
years
the
funds
of
his
savings
bank
amounted
to
nearly
a
thousand
pounds
and
if
poor
villagers
out
of
eight
shillings
a
week
and
female
labourers
and
servants
out
of
much
less
could
lay
aside
this
sum
what
might
not
mechanics
artizans
miners
and
accomplish
who
earn
from
thirty
to
fifty
shillings
a
week
all
the
year
round
the
example
set
by
duncan
was
followed
in
many
towns
and
districts
in
england
and
scotland
in
every
instance
the
model
of
the
ruthwell
parish
bank
was
followed
and
the
principle
was
adopted
the
savings
banks
thus
instituted
were
not
eleemosynary
institutions
nor
dependent
upon
anybody
charity
or
patronage
but
their
success
rested
entirely
with
the
depositors
themselves
they
encouraged
the
industrious
classes
to
rely
upon
their
own
resources
to
exercise
forethought
and
economy
in
the
conduct
of
life
to
cherish
and
and
to
provide
for
their
comfort
and
maintenance
in
old
age
by
the
careful
use
of
the
products
of
their
industry
instead
of
having
to
rely
for
aid
upon
the
thankless
dole
of
a
begrudged
the
establishment
of
savings
banks
with
these
objects
at
length
began
to
be
recognized
as
a
matter
of
national
concern
and
in
an
act
was
passed
which
served
to
increase
their
number
and
extend
their
usefulness
various
measures
have
since
been
adopted
with
the
object
of
increasing
their
efficiency
and
security
but
notwithstanding
the
great
good
which
these
institutions
have
accomplished
it
is
still
obvious
that
the
classes
of
workpeople
avail
themselves
of
them
to
only
a
very
limited
extent
a
very
small
portion
of
the
four
hundred
millions
estimated
to
be
annually
earned
by
the
working
classes
finds
its
way
to
the
savings
bank
while
at
least
twenty
times
the
amount
is
spent
annually
at
the
beershop
and
the
it
is
not
the
class
of
working
men
and
women
who
invest
money
in
the
savings
banks
but
those
who
earn
comparatively
moderate
incomes
thus
the
most
numerous
class
of
depositors
in
the
manchester
and
salford
savings
bank
is
that
of
domestic
servants
after
them
rank
clerks
shopmen
porters
and
miners
only
about
a
third
part
of
the
deposits
belong
to
the
operatives
artizans
and
mechanics
it
is
the
same
in
manufacturing
districts
generally
a
few
years
since
it
was
found
that
of
the
numerous
female
depositors
at
dundee
only
one
was
a
factory
worker
the
rest
were
for
the
most
part
servants
there
is
another
fact
that
is
remarkable
the
habit
of
saving
does
not
so
much
prevail
in
those
counties
where
wages
are
the
highest
as
in
those
counties
where
wages
are
the
lowest
previous
to
the
era
of
post
office
savings
banks
the
inhabitants
of
wilts
and
dorset
where
wages
are
about
the
lowest
in
england
deposited
more
money
in
the
savings
banks
per
head
of
the
population
than
they
did
in
lancashire
and
yorkshire
where
wages
are
about
the
highest
in
england
taking
yorkshire
itself
and
dividing
it
into
manufacturing
and
agricultural
the
manufacturing
inhabitants
of
the
west
riding
of
york
invested
about
shillings
per
head
of
the
population
in
the
savings
banks
whilst
the
agricultural
population
of
the
east
riding
invested
about
three
times
that
amount
private
soldiers
are
paid
much
less
wages
per
week
than
the
workmen
and
yet
they
put
more
money
in
the
savings
banks
than
workmen
who
are
paid
from
thirty
to
forty
shillings
a
week
soldiers
are
generally
supposed
to
be
a
particularly
thoughtless
class
indeed
they
are
sometimes
held
up
to
odium
as
reckless
and
dissolute
but
the
military
savings
bank
returns
refute
the
vilification
and
prove
that
the
british
soldier
is
as
sober
and
frugal
as
we
already
know
him
to
be
brave
most
people
forget
that
the
soldier
must
be
obedient
sober
and
honest
if
he
is
a
drunkard
he
is
punished
if
he
is
dishonest
he
is
drummed
out
of
the
regiment
wonderful
is
the
magic
of
drill
drill
means
discipline
training
education
the
first
drill
of
every
people
is
military
it
has
been
the
first
education
of
nations
the
duty
of
obedience
is
thus
taught
on
a
large
scale
submission
to
authority
united
action
under
a
common
head
these
soldiers
who
are
ready
to
march
steadily
against
vollied
fire
against
belching
cannon
up
fortress
heights
or
to
beat
their
heads
against
bristling
bayonets
as
they
did
at
badajos
were
once
tailors
shoemakers
mechanics
delvers
weavers
and
ploughmen
with
mouths
gaping
shoulders
stooping
feet
straggling
arms
and
hands
like
great
fins
hanging
by
their
sides
but
now
their
gait
is
firm
and
martial
their
figures
are
erect
and
they
march
along
to
the
sound
of
music
with
a
tread
that
makes
the
earth
shake
such
is
the
wonderful
power
of
drill
nations
as
they
become
civilized
adopt
other
methods
of
discipline
the
drill
becomes
industrial
conquest
and
destruction
give
place
to
production
in
many
forms
and
what
trophies
industry
has
won
what
skill
has
it
exercised
what
labours
has
it
performed
every
industrial
process
is
performed
by
drilled
bands
of
artizans
go
into
yorkshire
and
lancashire
and
you
will
find
armies
of
drilled
labourers
at
work
where
the
discipline
is
perfect
and
the
results
as
regards
the
amount
of
manufactured
productions
turned
out
of
hand
are
prodigious
on
efficient
drilling
and
discipline
men
success
as
individuals
and
as
societies
entirely
depends
the
most
man
is
under
discipline
and
the
more
perfect
the
discipline
the
more
complete
his
condition
a
man
must
drill
his
desires
and
keep
them
under
subjection
he
must
obey
the
word
of
command
otherwise
he
is
the
sport
of
passion
and
impulse
the
religions
man
life
is
full
of
discipline
and
the
man
of
business
is
entirely
subject
to
system
and
rule
the
happiest
home
is
that
where
the
discipline
is
the
most
perfect
and
yet
where
it
is
the
least
felt
we
at
length
become
subject
to
it
as
to
a
law
of
nature
and
while
it
binds
us
firmly
yet
we
feel
it
not
the
force
of
habit
is
but
the
force
of
drill
one
dare
scarcely
hint
in
these
days
at
the
necessity
for
compulsory
conscription
and
yet
were
the
people
at
large
compelled
to
pass
through
the
discipline
of
the
army
the
country
would
be
stronger
the
people
would
be
soberer
and
thrift
would
become
much
more
habitual
than
it
is
at
present
military
savings
banks
were
first
suggested
by
paymaster
fairfowl
in
and
about
ten
years
later
the
question
was
again
raised
by
colonel
oglander
of
the
foot
cameronians
the
subject
was
brought
under
the
notice
of
the
late
duke
of
wellington
and
negatived
the
duke
making
the
following
memorandum
on
the
subject
there
is
nothing
that
i
know
of
to
prevent
a
soldier
equally
with
others
of
his
subjects
from
investing
his
money
in
savings
banks
if
there
be
any
impediment
it
should
be
taken
away
but
i
doubt
the
expediency
of
going
further
the
idea
however
seems
to
have
occurred
to
the
duke
that
the
proposal
to
facilitate
the
saving
of
money
by
private
soldiers
might
be
turned
to
account
in
the
way
of
a
reduction
in
the
army
expenditure
and
he
characteristically
added
has
a
soldier
more
pay
than
he
requires
if
he
has
it
should
be
lowered
not
to
those
now
in
the
service
but
to
those
enlisted
hereafter
no
one
however
could
allege
that
the
pay
of
the
private
soldier
was
excessive
and
it
was
not
likely
that
any
proposal
to
lower
it
would
be
entertained
the
subject
of
savings
banks
for
the
army
was
allowed
to
rest
for
a
time
but
by
the
assistance
of
sir
james
mcgregor
and
lord
howick
a
scheme
was
at
length
approved
and
finally
established
in
the
result
has
proved
satisfactory
in
an
eminent
degree
and
speaks
well
for
the
character
of
the
british
soldier
it
appears
from
a
paper
presented
to
the
house
of
commons
some
years
ago
giving
the
details
of
the
savings
effected
by
the
respective
corps
that
the
men
of
the
royal
artillery
had
saved
over
thousand
pounds
or
an
average
of
sixteen
pounds
to
each
depositor
these
savings
were
made
out
of
a
daily
pay
of
one
and
threepence
and
a
penny
for
or
equal
to
about
nine
and
sixpence
a
week
subject
to
sundry
deductions
for
extra
clothing
again
the
men
of
the
royal
engineers
mostly
drawn
from
the
skilled
mechanical
class
had
saved
nearly
twelve
thousand
pounds
or
an
average
of
about
twenty
pounds
for
each
depositor
the
regiment
of
the
line
cameronians
whose
pay
was
a
shilling
a
day
and
a
penny
for
beer
saved
over
four
thousand
pounds
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
of
the
first
battalion
or
of
the
corps
were
depositors
in
the
savings
bank
and
their
savings
amounted
to
about
seventeen
pounds
per
man
but
this
is
not
all
private
soldiers
out
of
their
small
earnings
are
accustomed
to
remit
considerable
sums
through
the
post
office
to
their
poor
relations
at
home
in
one
year
thousand
pounds
were
thus
sent
from
aldershot
the
average
amount
of
each
money
order
being
shillings
and
fourpence
and
if
men
with
seven
shillings
and
a
week
can
do
so
much
what
might
not
skilled
workmen
do
whose
earnings
amount
to
from
two
to
three
pounds
a
week
soldiers
serving
abroad
during
arduous
campaigns
have
proved
themselves
to
be
equally
thoughtful
and
provident
during
the
war
in
the
crimea
the
soldiers
and
seamen
sent
home
through
the
money
order
office
thousand
pounds
and
the
army
works
corps
thousand
pounds
more
than
a
year
before
the
money
order
system
was
introduced
at
scutari
miss
nightingale
took
charge
of
the
savings
she
found
them
most
willing
to
abridge
their
own
comforts
or
indulgences
for
the
sake
of
others
dear
to
them
as
well
as
for
their
own
future
and
she
devoted
an
afternoon
in
every
week
to
receiving
and
forwarding
their
savings
to
england
she
remitted
many
thousand
pounds
in
this
manner
and
it
was
distributed
by
a
friend
in
london
much
of
it
to
the
remotest
corners
of
scotland
and
ireland
and
it
afforded
some
evidence
that
the
seed
fell
in
good
places
as
well
as
of
the
punctuality
of
the
post
office
that
of
the
whole
number
of
remittances
all
but

were
duly
acknowledged
again

is
not
a

returning
from
india
but
brings
home
with
it
a
store
of
savings
in
the
year
after
the
indian
mutiny
more
than
twenty
thousand
pounds
were
remitted
on
account
of
invalided
men
sent
back
to
england
besides
which
there
were
eight
regiments
which
brought
home
balances
to
their
credits
in
the
regimental
banks
amounting
to
the
highest

whose

amounted

fund
for
military
savings
banks
on
the
of
january
was
and
yet
the
private
soldiers
do
not
deposit
all
their
savings
in
the
military
savings
banks
especially
when
they
can
obtain
access
to
an
ordinary
savings
bank
we
are
informed
that
many
of
the
household
troops
stationed
in
london
deposit
their
spare
money
in
the
savings
banks
rather
than
in
the
regimental
banks
and
when
the
question
was
on
a
recent
occasion
asked
as
to
the
cause
the
answer
given
was
i
would
not
have
my
sergeant
know
that
i
was
saving
money
but
in
addition
to
this
the
private
soldier
would
rather
that
his
comrades
did
not
know
that
he
was
saving
money
for
the
thriftless
soldier
like
the
thriftless
workman
when
he
has
spent
everything
of
his
own
is
very
apt
to
set
up
a
kind
of
right
to
borrow
from
the
fund
of
his
more
thrifty
comrade
the
same
feeling
of
suspicion
frequently
prevents
workmen
depositing
money
in
the
ordinary
savings
bank
they
do
not
like
it
to
be
known
to
their
employers
that
they
are
saving
money
being
under
the
impression
that
it
might
lead
to
attempts
to
lower
their
wages
a
working
man
in
a
town
in
yorkshire
who
had
determined
to
make
a
deposit
in
the
savings
bank
of
which
his
master
was
a
director
went
repeatedly
to
watch
at
the
door
of
the
bank
before
he
could
ascertain
that
his
master
was
absent
and
he
only
paid
in
his
money
after
several
weeks
waiting
when
ne
had
assured
himself
of
this
fact
the
miners
at
bilston
at
least
such
of
them
as
put
money
in
the
savings
bank
were
accustomed
to
deposit
it
in
other
names
than
their
own
nor
were
they
without
reason
for
some
of
their
employers
were
actually
opposed
to
the
institution
of
savings
banks
fearing
lest
the
workmen
might
apply
their
savings
to
their
maintenance
during
a
not
reflecting
that
they
have
the
best
guarantee
of
the
steadiness
of
this
class
of
men
in
their
deposits
at
the
savings
bank
baker
inspector
of
factories
has
said
that
the
supreme
folly
of
a
strike
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
there
is
seldom
or
never
a
rich
workman
at
the
head
of
it
a
magistrate
at
bilston
not
connected
with
the
employment
of
workmen
has
mentioned
the
following
case
i
prevailed
he
says
upon
a
workman
to
begin
a
deposit
in
the
savings
bank
he
came
most
unwillingly
his
deposits
were
small
although
i
knew
his
gains
to
be
great
i
encouraged
him
by
expressing
satisfaction
at
the
course
he
was
taking
his
deposits
became
greater
and
at
the
end
of
five
years
he
drew
out
the
fund
he
had
accumulated
bought
a
piece
of
land
and
has
built
a
house
upon
it
i
think
if
i
had
not
spoken
to
him
the
whole
amount
would
have
been
spent
in
feasting
or
clubs
or
contributions
to
the
trades
unions
that
man
eyes
are
now
open
his
social
position
is
raised
he
sees
and
feels
as
we
do
and
will
influence
others
to
follow
his
example
from
what
we
have
said
it
will
be
obvious
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
ability
of
a
large
proportion
of
the
classes
of
working
men
to
lay
by
a
store
of
savings
when
they
set
their
minds
upon
any
object
they
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
requisite
money
a
single
town
in
lancashire
contributed
thirty
thousand
pounds
to
support
their
when
on
strike
in
an
adjoining
town
at
a
time
when
there
are
no
strikes
why
should
they
not
save
as
much
money
on
their
own
account
for
their
own
permanent
comfort
many
workmen
already
save
with
this
object
and
what
they
do
all
might
do
we
know
of
one
large
mechanical
establishment
situated
in
an
agricultural
district
where
the
temptations
to
useless
expenditure
are
few
in
which
nearly
all
the
men
are
habitual
economists
and
have
saved
sums
varying
from
two
hundred
to
five
hundred
pounds
each
many
factory
operatives
with
their
families
might
easily
lay
by
from
five
to
ten
shillings
a
week
which
in
a
few
years
would
amount
to
considerable
sums
at
darwen
only
a
short
time
ago
an
operative
drew
his
savings
out
of
the
bank
to
purchase
a
row
of
cottages
now
become
his
property
many
others
in
the
same
place
and
in
the
neighbouring
towns
are
engaged
in
building
cottages
for
themselves
some
by
means
of
their
contributions
to
building
societies
and
others
by
means
of
their
savings
accumulated
in
the
bank
a
respectably
dressed
working
man
when
making
a
payment
one
day
at
the
bradford
savings
bank
which
brought
his
account
up
to
nearly
eighty
pounds
informed
the
manager
how
it
was
that
he
had
been
induced
to
become
a
depositor
he
had
been
a
drinker
but
one
day
accidentally
finding
his
wife
savings
bank
deposit
book
from
which
he
learnt
that
she
had
laid
by
about
twenty
pounds
he
said
to
himself
well
now
if
this
can
be
done
while
i
am
spending
what
might
we
do
if
both
were
saving
the
man
gave
up
his
drinking
and
became
one
of
the
most
respectable
persons
of
his
class
i
owe
it
all
he
said
to
my
wife
and
the
savings
bank
when
workmen
such
as
these
are
able
to
accumulate
a
sufficient
store
of
savings
they
ought
gradually
to
give
up
hard
work
and
remove
from
the
field
of
competition
as
old
age
comes
upon
them
they
ought
also
to
give
place
to
younger
men
and
prevent
themselves
being
beaten
down
into
the
ranks
of
labour
after
sixty
a
man
physical
powers
fail
him
and
by
that
time
he
ought
to
have
made
provision
for
his
independent
maintenance
nor
are
the
instances
by
any
means
uncommon
of
workmen
laying
by
money
with
this
object
and
thereby
proving
what
the
whole
class
might
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
accomplish
in
the
same
direction
the
extent
to
which
penny
banks
have
been
used
by
the
very
poorest
classes
wherever
started
affords
a
striking
illustration
how
much
may
be
done
by
merely
providing
increased
opportunities
for
the
practice
of
thrift
the
first
penny
bank
was
started
in
greenock
about
thirty
years
since
as
an
auxiliary
to
the
savings
bank
the
object
of
the
projector
scott
was
to
enable
poor
persons
whose
savings
amounted
to
less
than
a
shilling
the
savings
bank
minimum
to
deposit
them
in
a
safe
place
in
one
year
about
five
thousand
depositors
placed
with
the
greenock
institution
the
estimable
queckett
a
curate
in
the
east
end
of
london
next
opened
a
penny
bank
and
the
results
were
very
remarkable
in
one
year
as
many
as
deposits
were
made
in
the
bank
the
number
of
depositors
was
limited
to
and
the
demand
for
admission
was
so
great
that
there
were
usually
many
waiting
until
vacancies
occurred
some
save
for
their
rent
said
queckett
others
for
clothes
and
apprenticing
their
children
and
various
are
the
little
objects
to
which
the
savings
are
to
be
applied
every
repayment
passes
through
my
own
hands
which
gives
an
opportunity
of
hearing
of
sickness
or
sorrow
or
any
other
cause
which
compels
the
withdrawal
of
the
little
fund
it
is
besides
a
feeder
to
the
larger
savings
banks
to
which
many
are
turned
over
when
the
weekly
payments
tendered
exceed
the
usual
sum
many
of
those
who
could
at
first
scarcely
advance
beyond
a
penny
a
week
can
now
deposit
a
silver
coin
of
some
kind
never
was
the
moral
influence
of
the
parish
clergyman
more
wisely
employed
than
in
this
case
not
many
of
those
whom
queckett
thus
laboured
to
serve
were
amongst
the
class
but
by
helping
them
to
be
frugal
and
improving
their
physical
condition
he
was
enabled
gradually
to
elevate
their
social
tastes
and
to
awaken
in
them
a
religious
life
to
which
the
greater
number
of
them
had
before
been
strangers
a
powerful
influence
was
next
given
to
the
movement
by
charles
sikes
cashier
of
the
huddersfield
banking
company
who
advocated
their
establishment
in
connection
with
the
extensive
organization
of
mechanics
institutes
it
appeared
to
him
that
to
train
working
people
when
young
in
habits
of
economy
was
of
more
practical
value
to
themselves
and
of
greater
importance
to
society
than
to
fill
their
minds
with
the
contents
of
many
books
he
pointed
to
the
perverted
use
of
money
by
the
working
class
as
one
of
the
greatest
practical
evils
of
the
time
in
many
cases
he
said
the
higher
the
workmen
wages
the
poorer
are
their
families
and
these
are
they
who
really
form
the
discontented
and
the
dangerous
classes
how
such
persons
take
any
interest
in
pure
and
elevating
knowledge
to
show
the
thriftlessness
of
the
people
sikes
mentioned
the
following
instance
an
eminent
employer
in
the
west
riding
he
said
whose
mills
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
have
scarcely
run
short
time
for
a
single
week
has
within
a
few
days
examined
the
rate
of
wages
now
paid
to
his
men
and
compared
it
with
that
of
a
few
years
ago
he
had
the
pleasure
of
finding
that
improvements
in
machinery
had
led
to
improvement
in
wages
his
spinners
and
weavers
are
making
about
shillings
a
week
in
many
instances
some
of
their
children
work
at
the
same
mill
and
in
a
few
instances
their
wives
and
often
the
family
income
reaches
from
a
hundred
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
per
annum
visiting
the
homes
of
some
of
these
men
he
has
seen
with
feelings
of
disappointment
the
air
of
utter
discomfort
and
squalor
with
which
many
are
pervaded
increase
of
income
has
led
only
to
increase
of
improvidence
the
savings
bank
and
the
building
society
are
equally
neglected
although
at
the
same
mill
there
are
some
with
no
higher
wages
whose
homes
have
every
comfort
and
who
have
quite
a
little
competency
laid
by
in
bradford
i
believe
a
munificent
employer
on
one
occasion
opened
seven
hundred
accounts
with
the
savings
bank
for
his
operatives
paying
in
a
small
deposit
for
each
the
result
was
not
encouraging
rapidly
was
a
small
portion
of
the
sums
drawn
out
and
very
few
remained
as
the
nucleus
of
further
deposits
footnote
from
sikes
excellent
little
handbook
entitled
good
times
or
the
savings
bank
and
the
fireside
sikes
suggested
that
each
mechanics
institute
should
appoint
a
preliminary
savings
bank
committee
to
attend
once
a
week
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
deposits
from
the
members
and
others
if
a
committee
at
each
institution
he
said
were
to
adopt
this
course
taking
an
interest
in
their
humble
circumstances
and
in
a
sympathizing
and
kindly
spirit
to
suggest
invite
nay
win
them
over
not
only
by
reading
the
lesson
but
forming
the
habit
of
true
economy
and
the
noblest
lessons
for
which
classes
could
be
formed
how
cheering
would
be
the
results
once
established
in
better
habits
their
feet
firmly
set
in
the
path
of
how
generally
would
young
men
grow
up
with
the
practical
conviction
that
to
their
own
advancing
intelligence
and
virtues
must
they
mainly
look
to
work
out
their
own
social
welfare
this
admirable
advice
was
not
lost
one
institution
after
another
embraced
the
plan
and
preliminary
savings
banks
were
shortly
established
in
connection
with
the
principal
mechanics
institutes
throughout
yorkshire
those
established
at
huddersfield
halifax
bradford
leeds
and
york
were
exceedingly
successful
the
penny
banks
established
at
halifax
consisted
of
a
central
bank
and
seven
subordinate
branches
the
number
of
members
and
the
average
amount
of
the
sums
deposited
with
them
continued
to
increase
from
year
to
year
fourteen
penny
banks
were
established
at
bradford
and
after
the
depositors
had
formed
the
habit
of
saving
in
the
smaller
banks
they
transferred
them
in
bulk
to
the
ordinary
savings
bank
penny
banks
were
established
in
and
around
glasgow
the
committee
in
their
report
stated
they
were
calculated
to
check
that
reckless
expenditure
of
little
sums
which
so
often
leads
to
a
confirmed
habit
of
wastefulness
and
improvidence
and
they
urged
the
support
of
the
penny
banks
as
the
best
means
of
extending
the
usefulness
of
the
savings
banks
the
penny
bank
established
at
the
small
country
town
of
farnham
is
estimated
to
have
contributed
within
a
few
years
a
hundred
and
fifty
regular
depositors
to
the
savings
bank
of
the
same
place
the
fact
that
as
large
a
proportion
as
of
the
whole
amount
deposited
is
drawn
out
within
the
year
shows
that
penny
banks
are
principally
used
as
places
of
safe
deposit
for
very
small
sums
of
money
until
they
are
wanted
for
some
special
object
such
as
rent
clothes
furniture
the
doctor
bill
and
purposes
thus
the
penny
bank
is
emphatically
the
poor
man
purse
the
great
mass
of
the
deposits
are
paid
in
sums
not
exceeding
sixpence
and
the
average
of
the
whole
does
not
exceed
a
shilling
the
depositors
consist
of
the
very
humblest
members
of
the
working
class
and
by
far
the
greatest
number
of
them
have
never
before
been
accustomed
to
lay
by
any
portion
of
their
earnings
the
rev
clarke
of
derby
who
took
an
active
interest
in
the
extension
of
these
useful
institutions
has
stated
that
of
the
whole
amount
received
by
the
derby
penny
bank
was
deposited
in
copper
money
and
a
large
portion
of
the
remainder
in
threepenny
and
fourpenny
pieces
it
is
clear
therefore
that
the
penny
bank
reaches
a
class
of
persons
of
very
small
means
whose
ability
to
save
is
much
less
than
that
of
the
workman
and
who
if
the
money
were
left
in
their
pockets
would
in
most
cases
spend
it
in
the
nearest
hence
when
a
penny
bank
was
established
at
putney
and
the
deposits
were
added
up
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
a
brewer
who
was
on
the
committee
made
the
remark
well
that
represents
thirty
thousand
pints
of
beer
at
one
of
the
penny
banks
in
yorkshire
an
old
man
in
receipt
of
parish
outdoor
relief
was
found
using
the
penny
bank
as
a
place
of
deposit
for
his
pennies
until
he
had
accumulated
enough
to
buy
a
coat
others
save
to
buy
an
clock
or
a
musical
instrument
or
for
a
railway
trip
but
the
principal
supporters
of
the
penny
banks
are
boys
and
this
is
their
most
hopeful
feature
for
it
is
out
of
boys
that
men
are
made
at
huddersfield
many
of
the
lads
go
in
bands
from
the
mills
to
the
penny
banks
emulation
as
well
as
example
urging
them
on
they
save
for
various
purposes
one
to
buy
a
chest
of
tools
another
a
watch
a
third
a
grammar
or
a
dictionary
one
evening
a
boy
presented
himself
to
draw
according
to
the
rules
of
the
penny
bank
a
week
notice
must
be
given
before
any
sum
exceeding
can
be
withdrawn
and
the
cashier
demurred
to
making
the
payment
well
said
the
boy
the
reason
this
mother
ca
pay
her
rent
i
goin
to
pay
it
for
as
long
as
i
have
owt
she
shall
it
in
another
case
a
youth
drew
to
buy
off
his
brother
who
had
enlisted
mother
frets
so
said
the
lad
that
she
break
her
heart
if
he
is
bought
off
and
i
can
not
bear
that
thus
these
institutions
give
help
and
strength
in
many
ways
and
besides
enabling
young
people
to
keep
out
of
debt
and
honestly
to
pay
their
way
furnish
them
with
the
means
of
performing
kindly
and
generous
acts
in
times
of
family
trial
and
emergency
it
is
an
admirable
feature
of
the
ragged
schools
that
almost
every
one
of
them
has
a
penny
bank
connected
with
it
for
the
purpose
of
training
the
scholars
in
good
habits
which
they
most
need
and
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
in
one
year
not
less
than
were
deposited
in
sums
by
the
scholars
connected
with
the
ragged
school
union
and
when
this
can
be
done
by
the
poor
boys
of
the
ragged
schools
what
might
not
be
accomplished
by
the
operatives
and
mechanics
of
england
but
another
capital
feature
in
the
working
of
penny
banks
as
regards
the
cultivation
of
prudent
habits
among
the
people
is
the
circumstance
that
the
example
of
boys
and
girls
depositing
their
spare
weekly
pennies
has
often
the
effect
of
drawing
their
parents
after
them
a
boy
goes
on
for
weeks
paying
his
pence
and
taking
home
his
the
book
shows
that
he
has
a
leger
folio
at
the
bank
expressly
devoted
to
him
that
his
pennies
are
all
duly
entered
together
with
the
respective
dates
of
their
deposits
that
these
savings
are
not
lying
idle
but
bear
interest
at
per
cent
per
annum
and
that
he
can
have
them
restored
to
him
at
any
time
if
under
without
notice
and
it
above
then
after
a
week
notice
has
been
given
the
book
is
a
little
history
in
itself
and
can
not
fail
to
be
interesting
to
the
boy
brothers
and
sisters
as
well
as
to
his
parents
they
call
him
good
lad
and
they
see
he
is
a
lad
the
father
if
he
be
a
sensible
man
naturally
bethinks
him
that
if
his
boy
can
do
so
creditable
a
thing
worthy
of
praise
so
might
he
himself
accordingly
on
the
next
saturday
night
when
the
boy
goes
to
deposit
his
threepence
at
the
penny
bank
the
father
often
sends
his
shilling
thus
a
good
beginning
is
often
made
and
a
habit
initiated
which
if
persevered
in
very
shortly
exercises
a
most
salutary
influence
on
the
entire
domestic
condition
of
the
family
the
observant
mother
is
quick
to
observe
the
effects
of
this
new
practice
upon
the
happiness
of
the
home
and
in
course
of
time
as
the
younger
children
grow
up
and
earn
money
she
encourages
them
to
follow
the
elder
boy
example
she
herself
takes
them
by
the
hand
leads
them
to
the
penny
bank
and
accustoms
them
to
invest
their
savings
there
women
have
even
more
influence
in
such
matters
than
men
and
where
they
do
exercise
it
the
beneficial
effects
are
much
more
lasting
one
evening
a
strong
muscular
mechanic
appeared
at
the
bradford
savings
bank
in
his
working
dress
bringing
with
him
three
children
one
of
them
in
his
arms
he
placed
on
the
counter
their
deposit
books
which
his
wife
had
previously
been
accustomed
to
present
together
with
ten
shillings
to
be
equally
apportioned
amongst
the
three
pressing
to
his
bosom
the
child
in
his
arms
the
man
said
poor
things
they
have
lost
their
mother
since
they
were
here
last
but
i
must
do
the
best
i
can
for
them
and
he
continued
the
good
lesson
to
his
children
which
his
wife
had
begun
bringing
them
with
him
each
time
to
see
their
little
deposits
made
there
is
an
old
english
proverb
which
says
he
that
would
thrive
must
first
ask
his
wife
but
the
wife
must
not
only
let
her
husband
thrive
but
help
him
otherwise
she
is
not
the
help
meet
which
is
as
needful
for
the
domestic
comfort
and
satisfaction
of
the
working
man
as
of
every
other
man
who
undertakes
the
responsibility
of
a
family
women
form
the
moral
atmosphere
in
which
we
grow
when
children
and
they
have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
life
we
lead
when
we
become
men
it
is
true
that
the
men
may
hold
the
reins
but
it
is
generally
the
women
who
tell
them
which
way
to
drive
what
rousseau
said
is
very
near
the
truth
men
will
always
be
what
women
make
them
not
long
ago
sikes
encountered
in
a
carriage
a
workman
travelling
from
sheffield
to
glasgow
during
holiday
times
to
see
his
mother
i
am
glad
said
sikes
to
find
a
workman
travelling
so
great
a
distance
for
a
purpose
like
that
yes
said
the
man
and
i
am
glad
to
say
that
i
can
afford
to
do
it
and
do
many
of
the
workmen
employed
in
your
workshop
save
money
asked
sikes
no
said
the
other
not
more
than
about
two
in
the
hundred
the
spare
earnings
of
the
others
go
not
to
the
savings
banks
but
to
the
and
when
did
you
begin
to
save
when
i
was
no
bigger
than
indicating
the
height
of
a
little
boy
the
first
money
i
saved
was
in
a
penny
bank
and
i
have
gone
on
saving
ever
since
such
being
the
influence
of
early
practice
and
example
we
are
glad
to
find
that
economy
is
now
being
taught
at
public
schools
the
rev
crallan
of
the
sussex
county
asylum
has
long
taught
lessons
of
thrift
to
poor
boys
and
girls
he
urges
the
establishment
of
penny
banks
in
connection
with
savings
banks
in
all
elementary
schools
he
wisely
contends
that
simple
lessons
on
money
its
nature
its
value
and
its
uses
together
with
the
various
duties
of
giving
spending
and
saving
would
have
a
vast
influence
on
the
rising
generation
the
practice
of
teaching
children
provident
habits
has
been
adopted
for
about
eight
years
in
the
national
schools
of
belgium
the
school
board
of
ghent
is
convinced
of
the
favourable
influence
that
saving
has
upon
the
moral
and
material
of
the
working
classes
and
believes
that
the
best
means
of
causing
the
spirit
of
economy
to
penetrate
their
habits
is
to
teach
it
to
the
children
under
tuition
and
to
make
them
practise
it
it
is
always
very
difficult
to
teach
anything
new
to
adults
and
especially
lessons
of
thrift
to
men
who
are
thriftless
their
method
of
living
is
fixed
traditional
and
inveterate
habits
of
expenditure
exist
among
them
with
men
it
is
the
with
women
it
is
dress
they
spend
what
they
earn
and
think
nothing
of
when
reduced
to
a
state
of
distress
they
feel
no
shame
in
begging
for
the
feeling
of
human
dignity
has
not
yet
been
sufficiently
developed
in
them
with
children
it
is
very
different
they
have
no
inveterate
habits
to
get
rid
of
they
will
for
the
most
part
do
as
they
are
taught
and
they
can
be
taught
economy
just
as
they
can
be
taught
arithmetic
they
can
at
all
events
be
inspired
by
a
clever
teacher
with
habits
of
economy
and
thrift
every
child
has
a
few
pence
at
times
the
master
may
induce
them
to
save
these
for
some
worthy
purpose
at
ghent
a
savings
bank
has
been
introduced
in
every
school
and
the
children
deposit
their
pennies
there
it
is
introduced
into
the
paying
schools
as
well
as
the
free
schools
for
habits
of
thrift
are
as
useful
to
men
and
women
of
the
richer
as
of
the
poorer
classes
the
results
of
the
lessons
on
economy
have
been
highly
satisfactory
the
children
belonging
to
the
schools
of
ghent
have
accumulated
eighteen
thousand
pounds
which
is
deposited
in
the
state
savings
bank
at
three
per
cent
interest
this
system
is
spreading
into
holland
france
and
italy
it
has
also
to
a
certain
extent
been
adopted
in
this
country
thus
glasgow
liverpool
birmingham
great
ilford
and
the
london
orphan
asylum
all
show
specimens
of
school
banks
and
we
trust
that
before
long
they
will
be
established
in
every
school
throughout
the
kingdom
footnote
a
pamphlet
published
at
ghent
says
of
the
paying
schools
the
spirit
of
economy
is
introduced
there
under
the
form
of
charity
the
young
girls
buy
with
their
pocket
money
firstly
materials
say
cotton
or
linen
of
which
they
afterwards
make
articles
of
dress
during
the
hours
set
aside
for
manual
work
afterwards
the
shirts
stockings
dresses
handkerchiefs
or
aprons
are
distributed
to
the
poorer
children
of
the
free
schools
the
distribution
becomes
the
object
of
a
little
holiday
we
know
of
nothing
that
can
be
more
touching
the
poor
children
are
assembled
in
the
collier
school
our
young
ladies
go
were
also
one
of
them
says
a
few
words
feelingly
to
her
sisters
in
the
poorer
classes
one
of
the
girls
of
the
free
schools
replies
then
the
pretty
and
useful
things
which
have
been
made
during
the
last
year
are
distributed
it
is
the
donors
themselves
who
present
the
fruits
of
their
labour
to
the
poorest
among
the
poor
the
distribution
is
intermingled
with
singing
need
we
reiterate
the
blessings
of
this
blessed
economy
it
will
be
obvious
from
what
has
been
said
that
the
practice
of
economy
depends
very
much
upon
the
facilities
provided
for
the
laying
by
of
small
sums
of
money
let
a
convenient
savings
bank
be
provided
and
deposits
gradually
flow
into
it
let
a
military
savings
bank
be
established
and
private
soldiers
contrive
to
save
something
out
of
their
small
pay
let
penny
banks
be
opened
and
crowds
of
depositors
immediately
present
themselves
even
the
boys
of
the
ragged
schools
being
able
to
put
into
them
considerable
sums
of
money
it
is
the
same
with
school
banks
as
we
have
seen
from
the
example
of
the
of
ghent
now
fifteen
years
ago
this
country
was
very
insufficiently
provided
with
savings
banks
for
the
people
there
were
then
many
large
towns
and
villages
altogether
unprovided
with
them
lancashire
had
only
thirty
savings
banks
for
upwards
of
two
millions
of
people
the
east
riding
of
yorkshire
had
only
four
savings
banks
there
were
fifteen
counties
in
the
united
kingdom
which
had
not
a
single
savings
bank
there
were
only
about
six
hundred
savings
banks
for
about
thirty
millions
of
people
these
were
open
only
for
two
or
three
hours
in
the
week
some
were
open
for
only
four
hours
in
the
month
the
workman
who
had
money
to
save
had
to
carry
his
spare
shillings
in
his
pocket
for
some
time
before
he
could
lay
them
by
and
in
the
meantime
he
might
be
exposed
to
constant
temptations
to
spend
them
to
keep
his
shillings
safe
he
must
have
acquired
the
of
saving
which
it
was
the
object
of
savings
banks
to
train
and
establish
guthrie
in
his
book
on
ragged
schools
published
in
said
how
are
our
manufacturing
and
handicraft
youth
situated
by
and
they
are
surrounded
with
innumerable
temptations
while
to
many
of
them
savings
banks
are
hardly
known
by
name
dissipation
has
her
nets
drawn
across
every
street
in
many
of
our
towns
sobriety
has
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
in
the
space
of
a
these
are
near
at
hand
open
by
day
and
blazing
by
night
both
on
sabbath
and
saturday
drunkenness
finds
immediate
gratification
while
economy
has
to
travel
a
mile
it
may
be
for
her
savings
bank
and
that
opens
its
door
to
thrift
but
once
or
twice
a
week

and
harvest
of
ragged
schools
or
a
third
plea
with
new
editions
of
the
first
and
second
plea
p
many
suggestions
had
been
made
by
friends
of
the
poorer
classes
whether
it
might
not
be
possible
to
establish
a
more
extended
system
of
savings
banks
throughout
the
country
as
long
ago
as
whitbread
introduced
a
bill
into
parliament
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
small
deposits
to
be
made
at
an
office
to
be
established
in
london
the
money
to
be
remitted
by
the
postmasters
of
the
districts
in
which
the
deposits
were
made
the
bill
further
contemplated
the
establishment
of
a
national
assurance
society
by
means
of
which
working
people
were
to
be
enabled
to
effect
assurances
to
an
extent
not
exceeding
two
hundred
pounds
and
to
secure
annuities
to
an
amount
not
exceeding
twenty
pounds
whitbread
bill
was
rejected
and
nothing
came
of
his
suggestions
the
exertions
of
sir
rowland
hill
having
given
great
vitality
to
the
post
office
system
and
extended
its
usefulness
as
a
public
institution
in
all
directions
it
was
next
suggested
that
the
offices
which
were
established
in
might
be
applied
for
the
purpose
of
depositing
as
well
as
for
transmitting
money
professor
hancock
published
a
pamphlet
on
the
subject
in
in
november
john
bullar
the
eminent
counsel
whose
attention
had
been
directed
to
the
subject
by
the
working
of
the
putney
penny
bank
suggested
to
the
post
office
authorities
the
employment
of
offices
as
a
means
of
extending
the
system
but
his
suggestion
did
not
meet
with
approval
at
the
time
and
nothing
came
of
it
similar
suggestions
were
made
by
other
gentlemen
by
hume
by
by
captain
strong
by
ray
smee
and
others
but
it
was
not
until
sikes
of
huddersfield
took
up
the
question
that
these
various
suggestions
became
embodied
in
facts
suggestions
are
always
useful
they
arouse
thinking
the
most
valuable
are
never
lost
but
at
length
work
themselves
into
facts
most
inventions
are
the
result
of
original
suggestions
some
one
attempts
to
apply
the
idea
failures
occur
at
first
but
with
greater
knowledge
greater
experience
and
greater
determination
the
suggestion
at
last
succeeds
post
office
savings
banks
owe
their
success
in
the
first
place
to
the
numerous
suggestions
made
by
whitbread
and
others
next
to
sir
rowland
hill
who
by
establishing
the
branch
post
offices
for
the
transmission
of
money
made
the
suggestions
practicable
next
to
sikes
who
took
up
the
question
in
pushed
it
persevered
with
it
and
brought
it
under
the
notice
of
successive
chancellors
of
the
exchequer
and
lastly
to
gladstone
who
having
clearly
foreseen
the
immense
benefits
of
post
office
savings
banks
brought
in
a
bill
and
carried
it
through
parliament
in
the
department
of
the
post
office
had
suggested
to
sikes
as
it
had
already
done
to
other
observers
that
the
organization
already
existed
for
making
post
office
savings
banks
practicable
throughout
the
kingdom
wherever
the
local
inspector
found
that
as
many
as
five
were
required
in
a
week
the
practice
was
to
make
that
branch
of
the
post
office
a
office
it
was
estimated
that
such
an
office
was
established
on
an
average
within
three
miles
of
every
working
man
door
in
the
kingdom
the
offices
were
open
daily
they
received
money
from
all
comers
and
gave
vouchers
for
the
amounts
transmitted
through
them
they
held
the
money
until
it
was
drawn
and
paid
it
out
on
a
proper
voucher
being
presented
the
post
office
was
in
fact
a
bank
for
the
transmission
of
money
holding
it
for
periods
of
from
hours
to
weeks
and
months
by
enabling
it
to
receive
more
money
from
more
depositors
and
by
increasing
the
time
of
holding
it
allowing
the
usual
interest
it
became
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
national
bank
of
deposit
the
results
of
the
post
office
savings
banks
act
have
proved
entirely
satisfactory
the
offices
have
been
largely
extended
they
are
now
about
four
thousand
in
number
consequently
the
facilities
for
saving
have
been
nearly
doubled
since
the
banks
were
established
the
number
in
the
london
district
is
now
about
four
hundred
and
sixty
so
that
from
any
point
in
the
thickly
populated
parts
of
the
metropolis
a
savings
bank
may
be
found
within
a
distance
of
a
few
hundred
yards
the
number
of
the
depositors
at
the
end
of
amounted
to
more
than
a
million
and
a
half
while
the
amount
of
deposits
reached
over
millions
sterling
at
the
same
time
the
amount
deposited
with
the
original
savings
banks
remained
about
the
same
footnote
the
amount
reached
at
the
end
of
post
office
savings
banks
possess
several
great
advantages
which
ought
to
be
generally
known
the
banks
are
very
widely
diffused
and
are
open
from
nine
in
the
morning
until
six
in
the
evening
and
on
saturdays
until
nine
at
night
persons
may
make
a
deposit
of
a
shilling
or
of
any
number
of
shillings
provided
more
than
thirty
pounds
is
not
deposited
in
any
one
year
the
post
office
officers
furnish
the
book
in
which
the
several
deposits
are
entered
the
book
also
contains
the
regulations
of
the
post
office
savings
banks
interest
is
allowed
at
the
rate
of
two
pounds
ten
shillings
per
cent
per
annum
another
most
important
point
is
the
security
government
is
responsible
for
the
full
amount
paid
in
so
that
the
money
deposited
with
the
post
office
savings
bank
is
as
safe
as
if
it
were
in
the
bank
of
england
the
money
saved
may
also
be
transferred
from
place
to
place
without
expense
and
may
be
easily
paid
to
the
depositor
when
required
no
matter
where
it
was
originally
deposited
all
that
is
done
is
done
in
perfect
secrecy
between
the
depositor
and
the
postmaster
who
is
forbidden
to
disclose
the
names
of
the
depositors
we
have
frequently
alluded
to
charles
william
sikes
in
connection
with
penny
banks
and
post
office
savings
banks
his
name
must
always
hold
a
distinguished
place
in
connection
with
those
valuable
institutions
he
is
the
son
of
a
private
banker
in
huddersfield
when
at
school
he
was
presented
as
a
prize
with
a
copy
of
essays
and
letters
he
perused
the
book
with
avidity
it
implanted
in
his
mind
the
germs
of
many
useful
thoughts
and
exercised
a
powerful
influence
in
giving
a
practical
character
to
his
life
huddersfield
is
a
busy
manufacturing
town
although
workmen
were
well
paid
for
their
labour
there
were
many
ups
and
downs
in
their
business
when
trade
became
slack
and
they
had
spent
all
that
they
had
earned
numbers
of
them
were
accustomed
to
apply
for
charity
in
the
streets
or
by
the
wayside
young
sikes
often
wondered
whether
these
people
had
ever
heard
of
franklin
and
of
his
method
of
avoiding
beggary
or
bad
times
by
saving
their
money
when
trade
was
brisk
and
they
were
well
off
early
in
sikes
entered
the
service
of
the
huddersfield
banking
company
it
was
the
second
joint
stock
bank
that
had
been
established
in
england
the
prudence
and
success
with
which
the
scotch
banking
companies
had
been
conducted
induced
the
directors
to
select
a
scotch
manager
one
of
the
first
resolutions
the
directors
adopted
was
to
give
deposit
receipts
for
sums
of
ten
pounds
and
upwards
for
the
purpose
of
encouraging
the
working
classes
in
habits
of
providence
and
thrift
sikes
being
somewhat
of
a
favourite
with
the
manager
often
heard
from
his
lips
most
interesting
accounts
of
the
provident
habits
of
the
scotch
peasantry
and
was
informed
by
him
of
the
fact
that
one
of
the
banks
at
perth
paid
not
less
than
twenty
thousand
pounds
a
year
as
interest
on
deposits
varying
from
ten
to
two
hundred
pounds
each
in
sikes
became
one
of
the
cashiers
of
the
company
this
brought
him
into
direct
contact
and
intercourse
with
the
very
class
which
from
the
direction
his
mind
was
taking
he
so
much
wished
to
understand
namely
the
thrifty
portion
of
the
industrious
classes
a
considerable
number
of
them
had
sums
lying
at
interest
as
years
rolled
on
sikes
often
witnessed
the
depositor
commencing
with
ten
or
twenty
pounds
then
make
permanent
additions
to
his
little
store
until
at
length
the
amount
would
reach
one
two
or
in
a
few
instances
even
three
hundred
pounds
sikes
would
often
imagine
the
marvellous
improvement
that
would
be
effected
on
the
condition
of
the
working
classes
if
every
one
of
them
became
influenced
by
the
same
frugality
and
forethought
which
induced
these
exceptional
operatives
to
deposit
their
savings
at
his
bank
about
that
time
trade
was
in
a
wretched
condition
the
handloom
weavers
were
almost
entirely
without
employment
privation
and
suffering
prevailed
on
every
side
and
these
were
often
borne
with
silent
and
noble
heroism
various
remedies
were
proposed
for
the
existing
evils
socialism
chartism
and
free
trade
were
the
favourites
theories
of
the
wildest
and
most
impracticable
character
abounded
and
yet
even
in
those
dark
days
there
were
instances
of
men
who
had
to
some
degree
made
the
future
predominate
over
the
present
who
could
fall
back
upon
their
reserve
in
the
joint
stock
or
savings
bank
to
tide
them
over
into
better
times
believing
in
the
beneficent
results
of
free
trade
sikes
was
equally
convinced
that
national
prosperity
as
well
as
national
adversity
might
be
attended
with
great
evils
unless
the
masses
were
endowed
with
habits
of
providence
and
thrift
and
prepared
by
previous
education
for
the
good
time
coming
so
eloquently
predicted
by
the
orators
of
the
league
many
discussions
with
working
men
in
his
homeward
evening
walks
convinced
sikes
that
there
were
social
problems
with
which
legislation
would
be
almost
powerless
to
grapple
and
of
these
the
thriftlessness
of
the
masses
of
the
people
was
one
an
employer
of
five
hundred
handloom
weavers
had
told
sikes
that
in
a
previous
period
of
prosperity
when
work
was
abundant
and
wages
were
very
high
he
could
not
had
he
begged
on
bended
knee
have
induced
his
men
to
save
a
single
penny
or
to
lay
by
anything
for
a
rainy
day
the
fancy
waistcoating
trade
had
uniformly
had
its
cycles
of
alternate
briskness
and
depression
but
experience
however
stern
its
teachings
could
not
teach
unwilling
learners
it
was
at
this
period
that
sikes
was
reading
the
late
archbishop
sumner
records
of
creation
and
met
with
the
following
passage
the
only
true
secret
of
assisting
the
poor
is
to
make
them
agents
in
bettering
their
own
condition
simple
as
are
the
words
they
shed
light
into
sikes
mind
and
became
the
keynote
and
the
test
to
which
he
brought
the
various
views
and
theories
which
he
had
previously
met
with
doles
and
charities
though
founded
frequently
on
the
most
benevolent
motives
were
too
often
deteriorating
to
their
recipients
on
the
other
hand
if
and
the
columns
of
true
majesty
in
man
could
only
be
made
characteristics
of
the
working
classes
generally
nothing
could
retard
their
onward
and
upward
progress
sikes
observed
that
until
the
working
classes
had
more
of
the
money
power
in
their
hands
they
would
still
be
periodically
in
poverty
and
distress
he
saw
that
if
provident
habits
could
only
he
generally
pursued
by
them
the
face
of
society
would
immediately
be
transformed
and
he
resolved
in
so
far
as
lay
in
his
power
to
give
every
aid
to
this
good
work
in
savings
banks
were
only
open
a
very
few
hours
in
each
week
in
huddersfield
where
more
than
a
year
was
paid
in
wages
the
savings
bank
after
having
been
established
over
thirty
years
had
only
accumulated
in
sikes
addressed
an
anonymous
letter
to
the
editors
of
the
to
which
by
their
request
he
afterwards
attached
his
name
in
that
letter
he
recommended
the
formation
of
penny
savings
banks
in
connection
with
mechanics
and
similar
institutes
in
simple
words
but
with
many
telling
facts
he
showed
how
the
young
men
and
the
young
women
of
the
working
classes
were
growing
up
deprived
of
almost
every
opportunity
of
forming
habits
of
thrift
and
of
becoming
depositors
in
savings
hanks
the
letter
was
received
with
general
approbation
the
committee
of
the
yorkshire
union
of
mechanics
institutes
gave
their
cordial
sanction
to
it
and
penny
banks
were
established
in
connection
with
nearly
every
mechanics
institute
in
yorkshire
sikes
personally
conducted
one
at
huddersfield
and
down
to
the
present
time
it
has
received
and
repaid
about
thirty
thousand
pounds
in
fact
the
working
people
of
huddersfield
doubtless
owing
in
a
great
measure
to
the
practical
example
of
sikes
have
become
most
provident
and
thrifty
the
deposits
in
their
savings
bank
having
increased
from
thousand
pounds
in
to
three
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
pounds
in
in
sikes
published
his
excellent
pamphlet
on
good
times
or
the
savings
bank
and
the
fireside
to
which
we
have
already
referred
the
success
which
it
met
with
induced
him
to
give
his
attention
to
the
subject
of
savings
banks
generally
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
they
were
so
utterly
inadequate
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
country
he
sought
an
interview
with
sir
cornewall
lewis
then
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
and
brought
the
subject
under
his
consideration
the
chancellor
requested
sikes
to
embody
his
views
in
a
letter
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
there
appeared
a
pamphlet
addressed
to
sir
cornewall
lewis
entitled
savings
banks
reforms
sikes
insisted
on
the
government
guarantee
being
given
for
deposits
made
in
savings
banks
but
this
was
refused
sikes
next
proceeded
to
ventilate
the
question
of
post
office
savings
banks
he
was
disappointed
that
no
measure
for
the
improvement
of
savings
banks
had
been
adopted
by
parliament
the
day
appeared
very
distant
when
his
cherished
wish
would
be
realized
that
the
savings
bank
should
really
become
the
bank
of
the
people
but
the
darkest
hour
precedes
the
dawn
when
he
had
almost
given
up
the
notion
of
improving
the
existing
savings
banks
the
idea
suddenly
struck
him
that
in
the
office
there
was
the
very
organization
which
might
be
made
the
basis
of
a
popular
savings
bank
he
communicated
his
plan
in
a
letter
to
his
friend
baines
then
member
for
leeds
the
plan
was
submitted
to
sir
rowland
hill
who
approved
of
the
suggestions
and
considered
the
scheme
practicable
so
far
as
the
post
office
was
concerned
the
plan
was
then
brought
under
the
notice
of
gladstone
who
afterwards
carried
the
bill
through
parliament
for
the
establishment
of
post
office
savings
banks
throughout
the
country
to
use
the
words
of
sikes
himself
when
predicting
at
the
social
science
association
the
success
of
the
post
office
savings
banks
should
the
plan
be
carried
out
it
will
soon
be
doing
a
glorious
work
wherever
a
bank
is
opened
and
deposits
received
will
to
some
extent
be
aroused
and
with
many
a
nobler
life
will
be
begun
they
will
gradually
discern
how
ruthless
an
enemy
is
improvidence
to
working
men
and
how
truly
his
friends
are
economy
and
forethought
under
their
guidance
household
purchases
could
be
made
on
the
most
favourable
terms
cash
any
house
taken
at
the
lowest
rent
punctual
and
the
home
enriched
with
comforts
until
it
is
enjoyed
and
prized
by
all
from
such
firesides
go
forth
those
inheriting
the
right
spirit
loving
industry
loving
thrift
and
loving
home
emulous
of
a
good
example
they
in
their
day
and
generation
would
nobly
endeavour
to
lay
by
a
portion
of
their
income
many
a
hard
winter
and
many
a
slack
time
would
be
comfortably
got
over
by
drawing
on
the
little
fund
to
be
again
replenished
in
better
days
and
if
the
plan
were
adopted
remembering
that
it
would
virtually
bring
the
savings
bank
within
less
than
an
hour
walk
of
the
fireside
of
every
working
man
in
the
united
kingdom
i
trust
that
it
is
not
taking
too
sanguine
a
view
to
anticipate
that
it
would
render
aid
in
ultimately
winning
over
the
rank
and
file
of
the
industrial
classes
of
the
kingdom
to
those
habits
of
forethought
and
which
bring
enduring
reward
to
the
individual
and
materially
add
to
the
safety
of
the
state
the
working
classes
have
not
yet
however
taken
full
advantage
of
the
facilities
for
saving
afforded
them
by
the
post
office
savings
banks
take
birmingham
for
instance
where
the
artizans
are
among
the
workmen
of
the
town
in
the
list
of
depositors
in
the
post
office
savings
banks
we
find
that
the
artizans
rank
after
the
domestic
servants
after
the
married
and
unmarried
women
and
after
the
miners
they
only
constitute
about
of
the
entire
depositors
though
it
is
possible
that
they
may
deposit
their
savings
in
some
other
investments
then
take
the
returns
for
the
entire
united
kingdom
out
of
every
ten
thousand
depositors
in
the
post
office
savings
banks
we
find
that
the
domestic
servants
are
again
the
first
next
the
women
married
and
single
next
persons
of
no
occupation
and
occupations
not
given
next
the
artizans
and
after
them
the
labourers
miners
tradesmen
soldiers
and
sailors
clerks
milliners
and
dressmakers
professional
men
and
public
officials
in
the
order
stated
we
must
however
regard
the
institution
as
still
too
young
to
have
fully
taken
root
we
believe
that
the
living
generation
must
pass
away
before
the
full
fruits
of
the
post
office
savings
banks
can
be
gathered
in
the
inhabitants
of
preston
have
exhibited
a
strong
disposition
to
save
their
earnings
during
the
last
few
years
more
especially
since
the
conclusion
of
the
last
great
strike
there
is
no
town
in
england
excepting
perhaps
huddersfield
where
the
people
have
proved
themselves
so
provident
and
so
thrifty
fifty
years
ago
only
one
person
in
thirty
of
the
population
of
preston
deposited
money
in
the
savings
bank
twenty
years
ago
the
depositors
increased
to
one
in

and
last
year
they
had
increased
to
one
in
five
in
the
sum
of
a
hundred

thousand

been
accumulated
in

of
the
human

have
split
human

consists
of
a
succession
of
small
events
each
of
which
is
comparatively
unimportant
and
yet
the
happiness
and
success
of
every
man
depends
upon
the
manner
in
which
these

are
dealt

built
up
on
little

little
things
well

honourably
transacted
the
success
of
a
man
in

depends
on
his
attention
to
little

the
comfort
of
a

is
the
result
of
small
things
well
arranged
and
duly
provided
for
good
government
can
only
be
accomplished
in
the
same
way
by
provisions
for
the
doing
of
little

accumulations
of
knowledge
and
experience
of
the
most
valuable
kind
are
the
result
of
little
bits
of
knowledge
and
experience
carefully
treasured
up
those
who
learn
nothing
or
accumulate
nothing
in
life
are
set
down
as
failures
because
they
have
neglected
little
things
they
may
themselves
consider
that
the
world
has
gone
against
them
but
in
fact
they
have
been
their
own
enemies
there
has
long
been
a
popular
belief
in
good
luck
but
like
many
other
popular
notions
it
is
gradually
giving
way
the
conviction
is
extending
that
diligence
is
the
mother
of
good
luck
in
other
words
that
a
man
success
in
life
will
be
proportionate
to
his
efforts
to
his
industry
to
his
attention
to
small
things
your
negligent
shiftless
loose
fellows
never
meet
with
luck
because
the
results
of
industry
are
denied
to
those
who
will
not
use
the
proper
efforts
to
secure
them
it
is
not
luck
but
labour
that
makes
men
luck
says
an
american
writer
is
ever
waiting
for
something
to
turn
up
labour
with
keen
eye
and
strong
will
always
turns
up
something
luck
lies
in
bed
and
wishes
the
postman
would
bring
him
news
of
a
legacy
labour
turns
out
at
six
and
with
busy
pen
or
ringing
hammer
lays
the
foundation
of
a
competence
luck
whines
labour
whistles
luck
relies
on
chance
labour
on
character
luck
slips
downwards
to
labour
strides
upward
and
aspires
to
independence
there
are
many
little
things
in
the
household
attention
to
which
is
indispensable
to
health
and
happiness
cleanliness
consists
in
attention
to
a
number
of
apparent
trifles
the
scrubbing
of
a
floor
the
dusting
of
a
chair
the
cleansing
of
a
teacup
but
the
general
result
of
the
whole
is
an
atmosphere
of
moral
and
physical
a
condition
favourable
to
the
highest
growth
of
human
character
the
kind
of
air
which
circulates
in
a
house
may
seem
a
small
matter
for
we
can
not
see
the
air
and
few
people
know
anything
about
it
yet
if
we
do
not
provide
a
regular
supply
of
pure
air
within
our
houses
we
shall
inevitably
suffer
for
our
neglect
a
few
specks
of
dirt
may
seem
neither
here
nor
there
and
a
closed
door
or
window
would
appear
to
make
little
difference
but
it
may
make
the
difference
of
a
life
destroyed
by
fever
and
therefore
the
little
dirt
and
the
little
bad
air
are
really
very
serious
matters
the
whole
of
the
household
regulations
are
taken
by
themselves
trifles
but
trifles
tending
to
an
important
result
a
pin
is
a
very
little
thing
in
an
article
of
dress
but
the
way
in
which
it
is
put
into
the
dress
often
reveals
to
you
the
character
of
the
wearer
a
shrewd
fellow
was
once
looking
out
for
a
wife
and
was
on
a
visit
to
a
family
of
daughters
with
this
object
the
fair
one
of
whom
he
was
partially
enamoured
one
day
entered
the
room
in
which
he
was
seated
with
her
dress
partially
unpinned
and
her
hair
untidy
he
never
went
back
you
may
say
such
a
fellow
was
not
worth
a
pin
but
he
was
really
a
shrewd
fellow
and
afterwards
made
a
good
husband
he
judged
of
women
as
of
men
by
little
things
and
he
was
right
a
druggist
advertised
for
an
assistant
and
he
had
applications
from
a
score
of
young
man
he
invited
them
all
to
come
to
his
shop
at
the
same
time
and
set
them
each
to
make
up
a
pennyworth
of
salts
into
a
packet
he
selected
the
one
that
did
this
little
thing
in
the
neatest
and
most
expert
manner
he
inferred
their
general
practical
ability
from
their
performance
of
this
smallest
bit
of
business
neglect
of
little
things
has
ruined
many
fortunes
and
marred
the
best
of
enterprises
the
ship
which
bore
home
the
merchant
treasure
was
lost
because
it
was
allowed
to
leave
the
port
from
which
it
sailed
with
a
very
little
hole
in
the
bottom
for
want
of
a
nail
the
shoe
of
the
horse
was
lost
for
want
of
the
shoe
the
horse
was
lost
for
want
of
the
horse
the
himself
was
lost
for
the
enemy
took
him
and
killed
him
and
for
want
of
the
intelligence
the
army
of
his
general
was
lost
and
all
because
a
little
nail
had
not
been
properly
fixed
in
a
horse
shoe
it
will
do
is
the
common
phrase
of
those
who
neglect
little
things
it
will
do
has
blighted
many
a
character
blasted
many
a
fortune
sunk
many
a
ship
burnt
down
many
a
house
and
irretrievably
ruined
thousands
of
hopeful
projects
of
human
good
it
always
means
stopping
short
of
the
right
thing
it
is
a
makeshift
it
is
a
failure
and
defeat
not
what
will
do
but
what
is
the
best
possible
thing
to
do
is
the
point
to
be
aimed
at
let
a
man
once
adopt
the
maxim
of
it
will
do
and
he
is
given
over
to
the
enemy
he
is
on
the
side
of
incompetency
and
defeat
and
we
give
him
up
as
a
hopeless
subject
say
the
french
political
economist
has
related
the
following
illustration
of
the
neglect
of
little
things
once
at
a
farm
in
the
country
there
was
a
gate
enclosing
the
cattle
and
poultry
which
was
constantly
swinging
open
for
want
of
a
proper
latch
the
expenditure
of
a
penny
or
two
and
a
few
minutes
time
would
have
made
all
right
it
was
on
the
swing
every
time
a
person
went
out
and
not
being
in
a
state
to
shut
readily
many
of
the
poultry
were
from
time
to
time
lost
one
day
a
fine
young
porker
made
his
escape
and
the
whole
family
with
the
gardener
cook
and
milkmaid
turned
out
in
quest
of
the
fugitive
the
gardener
was
the
first
to
discover
the
pig
and
in
leaping
a
ditch
to
cut
off
his
escape
got
a
sprain
that
kept
him
to
his
bed
for
a
fortnight
the
cook
on
her
return
to
the
found
the
linen
burnt
that
she
had
hung
up
before
the
fire
to
dry
and
the
milkmaid
having
forgotten
in
her
haste
to
tie
up
the
cattle
in
the
one
of
the
loose
cows
had
broken
the
leg
of
a
colt
that
happened
to
be
kept
in
the
same
shed
the
linen
burnt
and
the
gardener
work
lost
were
worth
full
five
pounds
and
the
colt
worth
nearly
double
that
money
so
that
here
was
a
loss
in
a
few
minutes
of
a
large
sum
purely
for
want
of
a
little
latch
which
might
have
been
supplied
for
a
few
halfpence
life
is
full
of
illustrations
of
a
similar
kind
when
small
things
are
habitually
neglected
ruin
is
not
far
off
it
is
the
hand
of
the
diligent
that
maketh
rich
and
the
diligent
man
or
woman
is
attentive
to
small
things
as
well
as
great
the
things
may
appear
very
little
and
insignificant
yet
attention
to
them
is
as
necessary
as
to
matters
of
greater
moment
take
for
instance
the
humblest
of
coins
a
penny
what
is
the
use
of
that
little
piece
of
copper
a
solitary
penny
what
can
it
buy
of
what
use
is
it
it
is
half
the
price
of
a
glass
of
beer
it
is
the
price
of
a
box
of
matches
it
is
only
fit
for
giving
to
a
beggar
and
yet
how
much
of
human
happiness
depends
upon
the
spending
of
the
penny
well
a
man
may
work
hard
and
earn
high
wages
but
if
he
allows
the
pennies
which
are
the
result
of
hard
work
to
slip
out
of
his
fingers
some
going
to
the
beershop
some
this
way
and
some
that
he
will
find
that
his
life
of
hard
work
is
little
raised
above
a
life
of
animal
drudgery
on
the
other
hand
if
he
take
care
of
the
pennies
putting
some
weekly
into
a
benefit
society
or
an
insurance
fund
others
into
a
savings
bank
and
confides
the
rest
to
his
wife
to
be
carefully
laid
out
with
a
view
to
the
comfortable
maintenance
and
culture
of
his
family
he
will
soon
find
that
his
attention
to
small
matters
will
abundantly
repay
him
in
increasing
means
in
comfort
at
home
and
in
a
mind
comparatively
free
from
fears
as
to
the
future
all
savings
are
made
up
of
little
things
many
a
little
makes
a
mickle
many
a
penny
makes
a
pound
a
penny
saved
is
the
seed
of
pounds
saved
and
pounds
saved
mean
comfort
plenty
wealth
and
independence
but
the
penny
must
be
earned
honestly
it
is
said
that
a
penny
earned
honestly
is
better
than
a
shilling
given
a
scotch
proverb
says
the
gear
that
is
gifted
is
never
sae
sweet
as
the
gear
that
is
won
what
though
the
penny
be
black
the
smith
and
his
penny
are
both
black
but
the
penny
earned
by
the
smith
is
an
honest
one
if
a
man
does
not
know
how
to
save
his
pennies
or
his
pounds
his
nose
will
always
be
kept
to
the
grindstone
want
may
come
upon
him
any
day
like
an
armed
man
careful
saving
acts
like
magic
once
begun
it
grows
into
habit
it
gives
a
man
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
of
strength
of
security
the
pennies
he
has
put
aside
in
his
savings
box
or
in
the
savings
bank
give
him
an
assurance
of
comfort
in
sickness
or
of
rest
in
old
age
the
man
who
saves
has
something
to
him
against
want
while
the
man
who
saves
not
has
nothing
between
him
and
bitter
biting
poverty
a
man
may
be
disposed
to
save
money
and
lay
it
by
for
sickness
or
for
other
purposes
but
he
can
not
do
this
unless
his
wife
lets
him
or
helps
him
a
prudent
frugal
thrifty
woman
is
a
crown
of
glory
to
her
husband
she
helps
him
in
all
his
good
resolutions
she
may
by
quiet
and
gentle
encouragement
bring
out
his
better
qualities
and
by
her
example
she
may
implant
in
him
noble
principles
which
are
the
seeds
of
the
highest
practical
virtues
the
rev
owen
formerly
of
bilston
a
good
friend
and
adviser
of
working
people
used
to
tell
a
story
of
a
man
who
was
not
an
economist
but
was
enabled
to
become
so
by
the
example
of
his
wife
the
man
was
a
at
manchester
and
he
was
persuaded
by
his
wife
on
their
to
allow
her
two
of
ale
a
day
as
her
share
he
rather
winced
at
the
bargain
for
though
a
drinker
himself
he
would
have
preferred
a
perfectly
sober
wife
they
both
worked
hard
and
he
poor
man
was
seldom
out
of
the
as
soon
as
the
factory
was
closed
she
had
her
daily
pint
and
he
perhaps
had
his
two
or
three
quarts
and
neither
interfered
with
the
other
except
that
at
odd
times
she
succeeded
by
dint
of
one
little
gentle
artifice
or
another
to
win
him
home
an
hour
or
two
earlier
at
night
and
now
and
then
to
spend
an
entire
evening
in
his
own
house
they
had
been
married
a
year
and
on
the
morning
of
their
wedding
anniversary
the
husband
looked
askance
at
her
neat
and
comely
person
with
some
shade
of
remorse
as
he
said
mary
we
had
no
holiday
since
we
were
wed
and
only
that
i
have
not
a
penny
in
the
world
we
take
a
jaunt
down
to
the
village
to
see
thee
mother
like
to
go
john
said
she
softly
between
a
smile
and
a
tear
so
glad
to
hear
him
speak
so
kindly
so
like
old
times
if
thee
like
to
go
john
i
stand
treat
thou
stand
treat
said
he
with
half
a
sneer
got
a
fortun
wench
nay
said
she
but
i
gotten
the
pint
o
ale
gotten
what
said
he
the
pint
o
ale
said
she
john
still
did
understand
her
till
the
faithful
creature
reached
down
an
old
stocking
from
under
a
loose
brick
up
the
chimney
and
counted
out
her
daily
pint
of
ale
in
the
shape
of
three
hundred
and
threepences
and
put
them
into
his
hand
exclaiming
thou
shalt
have
thee
holiday
john
john
was
ashamed
astonished
charmed
and
touch
it
has
thee
had
thy
share
then
i
ha
no
more
he
said
he
kept
his
word
they
kept
their
with
mother
and
the
wife
little
capital
was
the
nucleus
of
a
series
of
frugal
investments
that
ultimately
swelled
out
into
a
shop
a
factory
warehouses
a
country
seat
carriage
and
perhaps
a
liverpool
mayor
in
the
same
way
a
workman
of
even
the
humblest
sort
whose
prosperity
and
regularity
of
conduct
show
to
his
what
industry
temperance
manly
tenderness
and
superiority
to
low
and
sensual
temptation
can
effect
in
endearing
a
home
which
is
bright
even
amidst
the
gloom
of
poverty
such
a
man
does
good
as
well
as
the
most
eloquent
writer
that
ever
wrote
if
there
were
a
few
patriarchs
of
the
people
such
as
this
their
beneficial
influence
would
soon
be
sensibly
felt
by
society
at
large
a
life
well
spent
is
worth
any
number
of
speeches
for
example
is
a
language
far
more
eloquent
than
words
it
is
instruction
in
action
wisdom
at
work
a
man
daily
life
is
the
best
test
of
his
moral
and
social
state
take
two
men
for
instance
both
working
at
the
same
trade
and
earning
the
same
money
yet
how
different
they
may
be
as
respects
their
actual
condition
the
one
looks
a
free
man
the
other
a
slave
the
one
lives
in
a
snug
cottage
the
other
in
a
mud
hovel
the
one
has
always
a
decent
coat
to
his
back
the
other
is
in
rags
the
children
of
the
one
are
clean
well
dressed
and
at
school
the
children
of
the
other
are
dirty
filthy
and
often
in
the
gutter
the
one
possesses
the
ordinary
comforts
of
life
as
well
as
many
of
its
pleasures
and
conveniences
perhaps
a
library
the
other
has
few
of
the
comforts
of
life
certainly
no
pleasures
enjoyments
nor
books
and
yet
these
two
men
earn
the
same
wages
what
is
the
cause
of
the
difference
between
them
it
is
in
this
the
one
man
is
intelligent
and
prudent
the
other
is
the
reverse
the
one
denies
himself
for
the
benefit
of
his
wife
his
family
and
his
home
the
other
denies
himself
nothing
but
lives
under
the
tyranny
of
evil
habits
the
one
is
a
sober
man
and
takes
pleasure
in
making
his
home
attractive
and
his
family
comfortable
the
other
cares
nothing
for
his
home
and
family
but
spends
the
greater
part
of
his
earnings
in
the
or
the
the
one
man
looks
up
the
other
looks
down
the
standard
of
enjoyment
of
the
one
is
high
and
of
the
other
low
the
one
man
likes
books
which
instruct
and
elevate
his
mind
the
other
likes
drink
which
tends
to
lower
and
brutalize
him
the
one
saves
his
money
the
other
wastes
it
i
say
mate
said
one
workman
to
another
as
they
went
home
one
evening
from
their
work
will
you
tell
me
how
it
is
that
you
contrive
to
get
on
how
it
is
that
you
manage
to
feed
and
clothe
your
family
as
you
do
and
put
money
in
the
penny
bank
besides
whilst
i
who
have
as
good
wages
as
you
and
fewer
children
can
barely
make
the
ends
meet
well
i
will
tell
you
it
only
consists
in
this
in
care
of
the
pennies
what
is
that
all
ransom
yes
and
a
good
too
not
one
in
fifty
knows
the
secret
for
instance
jack
do
how
i
let
see
how
you
make
that
out
now
you
have
asked
my
secret
i
tell
you
all
about
it
but
you
must
not
be
offended
if
i
speak
plain
first
i
pay
nothing
for
my
drink
nothing
then
you
do
pay
your
shot
but
sponge
upon
your
neighbours
never
i
drink
water
which
costs
nothing
drunken
days
have
all
their
as
the
old
proverb
says
i
spare
myself
sore
heads
and
shaky
hands
and
save
my
pennies
drinking
water
neither
makes
a
man
sick
nor
in
debt
nor
his
wife
a
widow
and
that
let
me
tell
you
makes
a
considerable
difference
in
our
it
may
amount
to
about
a
week
or
seven
pounds
a
year
that
seven
pounds
will
clothe
myself
and
children
while
you
are
out
at
elbows
and
your
children
go
barefoot
come
come
that
going
too
far
i
do
drink
at
that
rate
i
may
take
an
odd
now
and
then
but
a
week
pooh
pooh
well
then
how
much
did
you
spend
on
drink
last
saturday
night
out
with
it
let
me
see
i
had
a
pint
with
jones
i
think
i
had
another
with
davis
who
is
just
going
to
australia
and
then
i
went
to
the
lodge
well
how
many
glasses
had
you
there
how
can
i
tell
i
forget
but
it
all
stuff
and
nonsense
bill
oh
you
ca
tell
you
do
know
what
you
spent
i
believe
you
but
that
the
way
your
pennies
go
my
lad
and
that
all
your
secret
yes
take
care
of
the
penny
that
all
because
i
save
i
have
when
you
want
it
very
simple
is
it
simple
oh
yes
but
there
nothing
in
it
yes
there
this
in
it
that
it
has
made
you
ask
me
the
question
how
i
manage
to
keep
my
family
so
comfortably
and
put
money
in
the
penny
bank
while
you
with
the
same
wages
can
barely
make
the
ends
meet
money
is
independence
and
money
is
made
by
putting
pennies
together
besides
i
work
so
hard
for
mine
and
so
do
you
that
i
ca
find
it
in
my
heart
to
waste
a
penny
on
drink
when
i
can
put
it
beside
a
few
other
pennies
in
the
bank
it
something
for
a
sore
foot
or
a
rainy
day
there
that
in
it
jack
and
there
comfort
also
in
the
thought
that
whatever
may
happen
to
me
i
need
beg
nor
go
to
the
workhouse
the
saving
of
the
penny
makes
me
feel
a
free
man
the
man
always
in
debt
or
without
a
penny
beforehand
is
little
better
than
a
slave
but
if
we
had
our
rights
the
poor
would
not
be
so
hardly
dealt
with
as
they
now
are
why
jack
if
you
had
your
rights
would
they
put
your
money
back
into
your
pocket
after
you
had
spent
it
would
your
rights
give
your
children
shoes
and
stockings
when
you
had
chosen
to
waste
on
beer
what
would
have
bought
them
would
your
rights
make
you
or
your
wife
thriftier
or
your
hearthstone
cleaner
would
rights
wash
your
children
faces
and
mend
the
holes
in
your
clothes
no
no
friend
give
us
our
rights
by
all
means
but
are
not
and
habits
we
want
good
habits
with
these
we
can
be
free
men
and
independent
men
if
we
but
determine
to
be
so
good
night
jack
and
mind
my
secret
it
nothing
but
care
of
the
and
the
pounds
will
take
care
of
themselves
and
jack
turned
off
at
the
towards
his
humble
and
dirty
cottage
in
main
court
i
might

as

he
could

it
may
be
easily
shown
how
much

carefully

might
do

take
up
a

of
a
provident

intended
for
the
use
of
those

who
have
a

a

to
spend
that
is
nearly
all
the
working
classes
of
the
country
it
is
not
necessary
to
specify
any
particular
society
because
the
best
all
proceed
upon
the
same
data
the
results
of
extensive
observations
and
experience
of
health
and
sickness
and
their
tables
of
rates
certified
by
public
actuaries
are
very
nearly
the
same
now
looking
at
the
tables
of
these
life
and
sickness
assurance
societies
let
us
see
what
a
penny
a

can
do
for

whenever
that

may
happen
even
though
it
should
be

after
the

been
effected
for

a

such
is
the
power
of
penny
a
day
who
would
have
thought
it
yet
it
is
true
as
any
one
can
prove
by
looking
at
the
tables
of
the
best
assurance
offices
put
the
penny
a
day
in
the
bank
and
it
accumulates
slowly
even
there
however
it
is
very
useful
but
with
the
assurance
office
it
immediately
assumes
a
vast
power
a
penny
a
day
paid
in
by
the
man
of
is
worth
to
his
wife
and
family
in
the
event
of
his
dying
next
month
or
next
year
it
is
the
combining
of
small
savings
for
purposes
of
mutual
assurance
by
a
large
number
of
persons
that
gives
to
the
penny
its
enormous
power
the
effecting
of
a
life
assurance
by
a
working
man
for
the
benefit
of
his
wife
and
children
is
an
eminently
unselfish
act
it
is
a
moral
as
well
as
a
religious
transaction
it
is
providing
for
those
of
his
own
household
it
is
taking
the
right
step
towards
securing
the
independence
of
his
family
after
he
the
has
been
called
away
this
right
investment
of
is
the
best
proof
of
practical
virtue
and
of
the
honest
forethought
and
integrity
of
a
true
man
the
late
joseph
baxendale
was
the
constant
friend
of
the
working
people
who
with
him
in
the
labours
of
his
life
he
was
a
man
of
strong
common
sense
and
might
have
been
styled
the
franklin
of
business
he
was
full
of
proverbial
wisdom
and
also
full
of
practical
help
he
was
constantly
urging
his
servants
to
lay
by
something
for
a
rainy
day
or
for
their
support
in
old
age
he
also
used
to
pension
off
his
old
servants
after
they
had
ceased
to
be
able
to
work
he
posted
up
texts
along
his
warehouses
so
that
those
who
ran
might
read
never
despair
nothing
without
labour
he
who
spends
all
he
gets
is
on
the
way
to
beggary
time
lost
can
not
be
regained
let
industry
temperance
and
economy
be
the
habits
of
your
lives
these
texts
were
printed
in
large
type
so
that
every
might
read
them
while
many
were
able
to
lay
them
to
heart
and
to
practise
the
advices
which
they
enjoined
on
other
occasions
baxendale
would
distribute
amongst
his
workpeople
or
desire
to
be
set
up
in
his
warehouses
and
places
of
business
longer
and
more
general
maxims
he
would
desire
these
printed
documents
to
be
put
up
in
the
offices
of
the
clerks
or
in
places
where
men
are
disposed
to
linger
or
to
take
their
meals
or
to
assemble
preparatory
to
work
they
were
always
full
of
valuable
advice
we
copy
one
of
them
on
the
importance
of
punctuality
method
is
the
hinge
of
business
and
there
is
no
method
without
punctuality
punctuality
is
important
because
it
subserves
the
peace
and
good
temper
of
a
family
the
want
of
it
not
only
infringes
on
necessary
duty
but
sometimes
excludes
this
duty
the
calmness
of
mind
which
it
produces
is
another
advantage
of
punctuality
a
disorderly
man
is
always
in
a
hurry
he
has
no
time
to
speak
to
you
because
he
is
going
elsewhere
and
when
he
gets
there
he
is
too
late
for
his
business
or
he
must
hurry
away
to
another
before
he
can
finish
it
punctuality
gives
weight
to
character
a
man
has
made
an
appointment
then
i
know
he
will
keep
it
and
this
generates
punctuality
in
you
for
like
other
virtues
it
propagates
itself
servants
and
children
must
be
punctual
when
their
leader
is
so
appointments
indeed
become
debts
i
owe
you
punctuality
if
i
have
made
an
appointment
with
you
and
have
no
right
to
throw
away
your
time
if
i
do
my
own
some
may
inquire
who
was
joseph
baxendale
he
was
in
fact
pickford
and
the
name
of
a
firm
known
all
over
england
as
well
as
throughout
the
continent
baxendale
was
the
son
of
a
physician
at
lancaster
he
received
a
good
education
went
into
the
cotton
trade
and
came
up
to
london
to
represent
the
firm
with
which
he
was
connected
a
period
of
commercial
pressure
having
occurred
he
desired
to
leave
the
cotton
trade
and
to
enter
upon
some
other
business
pickford
had
already
begun
the
business
of
a
carrier
but
he
was
hampered
by
want
of
money
baxendale
helped
him
with
capital
and
for
a
time
remained
a
sleeping
partner
but
finding
that
the
business
made
no
progress
principally
for
want
of
management
he
eventually
determined
to
take
the
active
part
in
working
and
managing
the
concern
he
threw
his
whole
energies
into
the
firm
of
pickford
and
co
he
reorganized
the
agencies
and
extended
them
throughout
the
kingdom
he
put
flying
vans
upon
the
road
equal
to
our
express
trains
and
slow
vans
equal
to
our
goods
trains
he
utilized
the
canals
to
a
large
extent
putting
on
flying
boats
between
all
the
larger
towns
indeed
the
roads
of
the
country
were
then
so
bad
that
in
certain
seasons
it
was
almost
impossible
to
convey
merchandize
from
one
part
of
the
country
to
another
the
carrying
on
of
such
an
important
and
extensive
business
required
much
capital
great
energy
and
business
management
the
horses
necessary
to
carry
on
the
traffic
were
increased
from
about
fifty
which
they
were
in
the
time
of
pickford
to
more
than
a
thousand
for
relays
of
horses
were
necessary
at
all
the
on
the
line
of
traffic
between
london
and
manchester
between
london
and
exeter
and
between
london
and
edinburgh
a
yard
was
established
where
all
the
boats
flying
and
slow
required
to
carry
on
the
business
were
constructed
at
baxendale
expense
the
carrying
business
required
a
great
deal
of
personal
supervision
only
a
man
of
determined
spirit
and
indomitable
energy
could
have
done
it
he
had
a
flying
boat
in
which
he
rapidly
passed
along
the
canals
seeing
that
the
men
were
at
their
posts
that
the
agents
were
at
work
and
the
traffic
duly
provided
for
he
did
this
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
at
other
times
he
would
fly
along
the
roads
in
his
special
travelling
carriage
always
paying
the
highest
prices
to
the
innkeepers
in
order
that
he
might
secure
the
best
horses
and
avoid
delay
and
loss
of
time
he
would
overtake
his
vans
and
see
that
his
men
were
sober
and
that
they
were
well
forward
at
the
stations
along
the
road
that
their
blunderbusses
were
loaded
for
highway
robbery
was
then
one
of
the
risks
of
travelling
by
road
that
the
agents
were
doing
their
duty
and
that
everything
was
in
proper
order
besides
overtaking
the
vans
he
would
sometimes
travel
by
a
for
he
knew
nearly
every
road
in
the
country
push
on
and
then
double
back
upon
his
drivers
who
never
knew
whether
he
was
before
or
behind
them
and
thus
general
vigilance
became
the
rule
of
all
by
these
and
various
other
means
the
business
of
the
concern
was
admirably
done
and
the
carrying
trade
of
the
country
was
brought
to
as
high
a
state
of
perfection
as
was
compatible
with
the
then
state
of
the
roads
and
canals
when
all
this
had
been
accomplished
the
disturbing
influence
of
railways
began
i
see
mischief
in
these
confounded
iron
roads
said
the
duke
of
bridgewater
but
the
time
for
railways
had
arrived
and
they
could
not
be
postponed
the
first
railroads
were
used
for
the
conveyance
of
coals
from
the
pits
to
the
seaside
where
they
were
shipped
for
london
then
it
was
proposed
that
they
should
be
laid
for
the
conveyance
of
goods
from
town
to
town
and
the
largest
traffic
being
in
lancashire
one
of
the
first
railways
was
constructed
between
liverpool
and
manchester
from
which
towns
they
were
afterwards
constructed
in
all
directions
throughout
the
country
had
baxendale
resisted
the
new
means
of
conveyance
he
would
before
long
have
been
driven
off
the
road
but
he
clearly
foresaw
the
ultimate
triumph
of
the
railway
system
and
he
went
with
it
instead
of
against
it
he
relieved
the
liverpool
and
manchester
company
of
a
great
deal
of
trouble
by
undertaking
to
manage
their
goods
traffic
and
by
collecting
and
delivering
it
at
both
towns
then
when
the
railways
from
warrington
to
birmingham
and
from
birmingham
to
london
were
projected
he
gave
evidence
before
the
committees
of
parliament
in
proof
of
the
estimated
traffic
and
when
the
lines
were
made
he
transferred
the
goods
from
his
carrying
vans
to
the
railway
he
thus
became
a
great
railway
carrier
collecting
and
delivering
goods
in
all
the
cities
and
towns
served
by
the
railways
which
had
by
that
time
become
established
he
also
became
a
large
shareholder
in
railways
his
status
in
the
line
was
so
great
that
he
was
invited
to
become
chairman
of
the
company
he
was
instrumental
in
conjunction
with
the
late
sir
william
cubitt
in
pushing
on
the
line
to
dover
but
the
dover
harbour
board
being
found
too
stingy
in
giving
accommodation
to
the
traffic
and
too
grasping
in
their
charges
for
harbour
dues
baxendale
at
once
proceeded
on
his
own
responsibility
to
purchase
folkestone
harbour
as
the
port
of
the
company
he
next
proceeded
to
get
up
the
boulogne
and
amiens
railway
which
was
for
the
most
part
constructed
with
english
capital
and
the
direct
line
from
london
to
paris
was
thus
completed
his
arduous
labours
in
connection
with
his
own
business
as
well
as
with
railway
extension
having
thrown
him
into
he
went
abroad
for
repose
while
absent
a
faction
was
got
up
in
liverpool
for
the
purpose
of
appointing
another
chairman
in
his
stead
and
though
he
was
unseated
by
a
trick
he
himself
accepted
his
dismissal
with
pleasure
his
sons
were
now
able
to
help
him
in
the
conduct
of
his
business
though
he
continued
to
the
close
of
his
life
to
take
an
interest
in
everything
that
was
going
on
he
was
never
weary
of
he
never
rested
in
giving
his
good
advice
the
results
of
his
large
experience
to
the
assistants
clerks
and
working
men
employed
in
his
various
offices
we
conclude
our
brief
notice
of
his
life
by
giving
another
of
his
sermons
which
he
distributed
plentifully
among
his
and
had
affixed
in
various
portions
of
his
warehouses
it
was
entitled
good
maxims
and
advice
an
old
servant
of
the
concern
observed
a
short
time
ago
that
he
began
life
in
the
employ
of
pickford
upon
low
wages
and
that
by
frugality
and
industry
he
had
gained
a
competency
his
maxim
was
never
to
spend
more
than
ninepence
out
of
every
shilling
although
this
may
appear
a
trifle
recollect
that
it
is
five
shillings
in
twenty
ten
pounds
in
forty
suppose
a
young
man
to
pursue
this
system
let
him
obtain
the
first
twenty
pounds
add
each
year
ten
pounds
he
will
at
the
end
of
six
years
be
possessed
of
upwards
of
one
hundred
pounds
if
in
early
life
the
opportunity
is
suffered
to
pass
it
rarely
happens
that
one
can
save
money
when
more
advanced
in
years
the
concern
in
which
we
are
engaged
has
been
defrauded
by
those
who
have
for
thirty
years
received
salaries
the
savings
from
which
had
they
followed
the
plan
that
is
recommended
would
have
placed
them
in
situations
of
comparative
affluence
and
we
should
now
have
seen
them
respectable
members
of
society
upon
industry
and
frugality
our
depends
it
is
not
great
talents
but
steady
application
that
is
required
there
are
none
of
us
that
may
not
obtain
stations
of
respectability
helps
them
that
help
themselves
that
follows
pleasure
instead
of
business
will
shortly
have
no
business
to
follow
i
frequently
complain
of
what
may
be
called
trifles
but
from
these
arising
frequently
we
are
at
length
lost
let
each
attend
to
his
respective
duties
keep
the
appointed
hours
and
never
defer
till
what
may
be
done
if
business
is
more
pressing
than
usual
give
additional
time
that
your
own
accounts
may
not
fall
into
confusion
and
that
you
may
not
be
the
means
of
causing
delay
and
trouble
to
others
it
often
happens
that
the
negligence
of
individuals
throws
additional
labour
upon
those
who
are
anxious
for
regularity
hiding
or
screening
the
faults
or
errors
of
others
is
a
system
that
has
prevailed
and
caused
much
loss
and
injury
frequently
to
the
offending
party
always
to
the
employer
late
occurrences
lead
me
to
draw
your
attention
to
this
subject
it
is
important
in
every
sense
both
as
regards
your
public
and
private
stations
there
is
nothing
more
worthy
of
a
man
than
truth
nothing
makes
him
feel
himself
so
despicable
as
a
lie
recollect
that
men
act
lies
without
speaking
them
and
that
all
false
appearances
are
lies
he
therefore
who
seeing
his
employer
injured
neglects
to
make
it
known
is
equally
guilty
with
this
addition
that
he
is
practising
a
lie
want
of
punctuality
is
a
lie
speak
and
act
openly
on
all
occasions
errors
will
be
fewer
and
labour
will
be
decreased
it
seldom
happens
that
we
can
do
any
important
services
but
small
services
are
always
in
use
take
therefore
every
opportunity
of
assisting
each
other
you
are
then
most
effectually
serving
your
employers
as
well
as
keeping
up
a
spirit
of
cordiality
and
goodwill
amongst
yourselves
a
good
christian
must
be
a
good
servant
whatever
your
lot
in
life
may
be
above
all
things
remember
that
fear
of
god
is
the

masters

the
sweat
of
industry
would
dry
and
die
but
for
the
end
it
workrt
to
man
is
a
shop
of
rules
a
pack
whose
every
parcel
underwrites
a
law
care
preserves
what
industry
gains
he
who
attends
to
his
business
diligently
but
carefully
throws
away
with
one
hand
what
he
gathers
with
the
the
acquisition
of
property
the
accumulation
of
capital
is
already
in
the
power
of
the
working
class
and
legislation
has
but
few
further
facilities
to
give
or
obstacles
to
remove
their
savings
are
now
so
large
that
only
soberer
habits
and
rounder
sense
are
needed
to
make
them
independent
capitalists
in
less
than
half
a
employers
can
do
a
great
deal
towards
promoting
habits
of
thrift
prudence
and
sobriety
amongst
their
workpeople
though
the
working
man
does
not
like
to
be
patronized
he
has
no
objections
to
be
helped
we
have
already
seen
that
individuals
can
do
much
they
can
cultivate
habits
of
economy
and
lay
by
a
certain
portion
of
their
earnings
for
help
in
time
of
need
but
they
want
encouragement
and
assistance
they
want
sympathy
they
want
help
if
masters
fully
understood
the
immense
amount
of
influence
which
they
possess
they
would
extend
their
sympathy
and
confidence
to
their
workmen
which
would
cost
them
so
very
little
and
profit
them
so
very
much
we
know
of
no
instance
where
an
employer
has
displayed
a
concern
for
the
social
and
improvement
of
his
workmen
in
which
he
has
not
been
repaid
by
their
increased
respect
and
zeal
on
his
behalf
he
may
for
instance
arrange
that
wages
shall
not
be
paid
so
as
to
drive
them
into
the
market
late
on
saturday
nights
when
they
are
often
under
the
necessity
of
making
their
weekly
purchases
at
a
great
disadvantage
of
course
workmen
who
possess
a
little
store
of
savings
might
make
their
purchases
at
greater
advantage
at
any
other
time
the
employer
might
also
avoid
paying
wages
in
and
thus
keep
his
workmen
out
of
the
way
of
incurring
an
expenditure
upon
drink
that
might
prove
so
hurtful
but
masters
can
do
more
than
this
they
can
actively
aid
their
workmen
in
the
formation
of
prudent
habits
by
establishing
savings
banks
for
men
and
women
and
penny
banks
for
boys
and
girls
by
encouraging
the
formation
of
provident
clubs
and
building
societies
of
provision
and
clothing
clubs
and
in
many
other
ways
they
might
also
distribute
among
them
without
any
officious
interference
good
counsel
as
to
the
manner
in
which
they
might
make
the
best
use
of
their
wages
many
large
employers
have
already
accomplished
much
practical
good
by
encouraging
the
formation
of
provident
institutions
in
which
they
have
never
failed
to
secure
the
respect
and
generally
the
of
their
workmen
at
the
same
time
there
is
much
want
of
sympathy
between
masters
and
men
in
fact
want
of
sympathy
pervades
all
classes
the
poorer
the
working
the
middle
and
the
upper
classes
there
are
many
social
gaps
between
them
which
can
not
yet
be
crossed
which
can
not
yet
be
united
if
i
were
to
be
asked
said
judge
talfourd
on
whom
death
was
at
the
moment
laying
his
hand
what
is
the
great
want
of
english
society
to
mingle
class
with
class
i
would
say
in
one
word
the
want
is
want
of
a
great
truth
but
not
yet
appreciated
it
is
the
old
truth
on
which
christianity
is
based
of
love
one
another
simple
saying
but
containing
within
it
a
gospel
sufficient
to
renovate
the
world
but
where
men
are
so
split
and
divided
into
classes
and
are
so
far
removed
that
they
can
scarcely
be
said
to
know
one
another
they
can
not
have
a
due
social
regard
and
consideration
much
less
a
genuine
sympathy
and
affection
for
each
other
charity
can
not
remedy
the
evil
giving
money
blankets
coals
and
to
the
poor
where
the
spirit
of
sympathy
is
wanting
does
not
amount
to
much
the
charity
of
most
of
the
lord
and
lady
bountifuls
begins
with
money
and
ends
there
the
is
absent
the
poor
are
not
dealt
with
as
if
they
belonged
to
the
same
common
family
of
man
or
as
if
the
same
human
heart
beat
in
their
breasts
masters
and
servants
live
in
the
same
unsympathetic
state
each
for
himself
is
their
motto
i
do
care
who
sinks
so
that
i
swim
a
man
at
an
inn
was
roused
from
his
slumber
there
is
a
fire
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
said
the
waiter
do
disturb
said
the
traveller
until
the
next
house
is
burning
an
employer
said
to
his
hands
you
try
to
get
all
you
can
out
of
me
and
i
try
to
get
all
i
can
out
of
you
but
this
will
never
do
the
man
who
has
any
sympathy
in
him
can
not
allow
such
considerations
to
overrule
his
better
nature
he
must
see
the
brighter
side
of
humanity
ever
turned
towards
him
always
to
think
the
worst
said
lord
bolingbroke
i
have
ever
found
the
mark
of
a
mean
spirit
and
a
base
soul
on
the
other
hand
the
operative
class
consider
their
interests
to
be
quite
distinct
from
those
of
the
master
class
they
want
to
get
as
much
for
their
labour
as
possible
they
want
labour
to
be
dear
that
they
may
secure
high
wages
thus
there
being
no
mutual
sympathy
nor
friendly
feeling
between
the
two
classes
but
only
money
considerations
collisions
are
frequent
and
strikes
occur
both
classes
backed
by
their
fellows
determined
to
fight
it
out
and
hence
we
have
such
destructive
strikes
as
those
of
preston
newcastle
london
and
south
wales
the
great
end
of
both
is
gain
worldly
gain
which
sometimes
involves
a
terrible
final
loss
a
general
suspicion
of
each
other
spreads
and
society
becomes
cankered
to
the
core
the
remedy
is
only
to
be
found
in
the
cherishment
of
a
larger
christian
sympathy
and
more
genuine
benevolence
thus
only
can
the
breath
of
society
be
sweetened
and
purified
money
gifts
avail
nothing
as
between
rich
and
poor
unless
there
is
a
soul
of
goodness
and
a
real
human
fellowship
between
them
the
mischief
and
the
curse
which
the
excellent
judge
talfourd
lamented
with
his
dying
breath
will
never
be
overcome
some
allege
that
this
want
of
sympathy
arises
for
the
most
part
from
the
evils
of
competition
it
is
heartless
selfish
mischievous
ruinous
and
so
on
it
is
said
to
produce
misery
and
poverty
to
the
million
it
is
charged
with
lowering
prices
or
almost
in
the
same
breath
with
raising
them
competition
has
a
broad
back
and
can
bear
any
amount
of
burdens
and
yet
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
competition
as
well
as
against
it
it
is
a
struggle
that
must
be
admitted
all
life
is
a
struggle
amongst
workmen
competition
is
a
struggle
to
advance
towards
higher
wages
amongst
masters
to
make
the
highest
profits
amongst
writers
preachers
and
politicians
it
is
a
straggle
to
succeed
to
gain
glory
reputation
or
income
like
everything
human
it
has
a
mixture
of
evil
in
it
if
one
man
prospers
more
than
others
or
if
some
classes
of
men
prosper
more
than
others
they
leave
other
classes
of
men
behind
them
not
that
they
leave
those
others
worse
but
that
they
themselves
advance
put
a
stop
to
competition
and
you
merely
check
the
progress
of
individuals
and
of
classes
you
preserve
a
dead
uniform
level
you
stereotype
society
and
its
several
orders
and
conditions
the
motive
for
emulation
is
taken
away
and
caste
with
all
its
mischiefs
is
perpetuated
stop
competition
and
you
stop
the
struggle
of
individualism
you
also
stop
the
advancement
of
individualism
and
through
that
of
society
at
large
under
competition
the
lazy
man
is
put
under
the
necessity
of
exerting
himself
and
if
he
will
not
exert
himself
he
must
fall
behind
if
he
do
not
work
neither
shall
he
eat
my
lazy
friend
you
must
not
look
to
me
to
do
my
share
of
the
world
work
and
yours
too
you
must
do
your
own
fair
share
of
work
save
your
own
money
and
not
look
to
me
and
to
others
to
keep
you
out
of
the
there
is
enough
for
all
but
do
your
own
share
of
work
you
must
success
grows
out
of
struggles
to
overcome
difficulties
if
there
were
no
difficulties
there
would
be
no
success
if
there
were
nothing
to
struggle
or
compete
for
there
would
be
nothing
achieved
it
is
well
therefore
that
men
should
be
under
the
necessity
of
exerting
themselves
in
this
necessity
for
exertion
we
find
the
chief
source
of
human
advancement
the
advancement
of
individuals
as
of
nations
it
has
led
to
most
of
the
splendid
mechanical
inventions
and
improvements
of
the
age
it
has
stimulated
the
shipbuilder
the
merchant
the
manufacturer
the
machinist
the
tradesman
the
skilled
workman
in
all
departments
of
productive
industry
it
has
been
the
moving
power
is
has
developed
the
resources
of
this
and
of
other
countries
the
resources
of
the
soil
and
the
character
and
qualities
of
the
men
who
dwell
upon
it
it
seems
to
be
absolutely
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
stimulating
the
growth
and
culture
of
every
individual
it
is
deeply
rooted
in
man
leading
him
ever
to
seek
after
and
endeavour
to
realize
something
better
and
higher
than
he
has
yet
attained
of
course
man
is
much
more
than
a
competing
being
that
is
only
one
of
his
characteristics
and
not
the
highest
or
noblest
he
has
sensibilities
sympathies
and
aspirations
which
should
induce
him
to
unite
and
cooperate
with
others
in
works
for
the
common
good
with
unfettered
individualism
there
may
and
there
ought
to
be
beneficent
cooperation
for
the
general
happiness
men
may
unite
to
labour
to
produce
and
to
share
with
each
other
the
fruits
of
their
corporate
industry
but
under
any
circumstances
there
will
be
the
instinct
of
competition
the
opportunities
for
competition
and
though
mixed
with
necessary
evil
there
will
be
the
ultimate
advantages
of
competition
one
of
the
results
of
industry
and
thrift
is
the
accumulation
of
capital
capital
represents
the
the
providence
and
the
enterprise
of
the
past
the
most
successful
accumulators
of
capital
have
in
all
times
risen
from
the
ranks
of
labour
itself
they
are
working
men
who
have
shot
ahead
of
their
fellows
and
who
now
give
employment
instead
of
receiving
it
these
persons
who
are
not
the
less
working
men
because
they
have
ceased
to
be
manual
labourers
by
creating
and
extending
the
sphere
of
productive
industry
must
be
regarded
as
amongst
the
most
effective
benefactors
of
the
people
as
they
unquestionably
are
among
the
principal
sources
of
the
power
and
wealth
of
any
nation
without
the
capital
accumulated
by
their
thrift
during
many
generations
the
lot
of
the
artizan
would
be
most
precarious
there
is
not
a
mechanic
but
has
the
use
of
the
money
of
the
master
who
employs
him
when
the
unskilled
labourer
lays
down
his
spade
he
leaves
idle
a
capital
worth
but
when
a
skilled
artizan
or
mechanic
leaves
his
mill
or
his
workshop
he
leaves
idle
a
capital
of
from
a
hundred
to
two
hundred
pounds
per
man
nor
does
the
skilled
workman
run
any
risk
whatever
as
regards
the
sums
invested
though
he
virtually
shares
the
profits
in
the
shape
of
the
wages
paid
for
his
labour
the
profit
which
remains
is
the
master
return
for
his
management
and
his
risks
it
is
well
known
however
that
the
risks
are
not
always
covered
as
the
in
bad
times
abundantly
demonstrates
the
workman
in
good
employment
is
not
liable
to
losses
by
bad
debts
he
has
no
obsolete
machinery
from
time
to
time
left
useless
on
his
hands
and
he
has
no
anxiety
about
finding
a
market
for
his
goods
nor
fears
respecting
fluctuations
in
the
price
of
the
raw
material
these
are
important
advantages
in
his
favour
which
he
does
not
usually
take
into
account
it
is
true
he
suffers
if
trade
is
bad
but
he
earns
high
wages
if
it
be
good
he
can
then
save
money
if
he
chooses
to
do
so
he
may
be
said
to
participate
in
the
adversity
or
prosperity
of
his
firm

without
incurring
any

carlyle
has
given
a
curious
account
of
the
great
english
manufacturer
plugson
of
dolly
undershot
says
to
his
men
spinners
this
is
the
hundred
thousand
we
have
gained
wherein
i
mean
to
dwell
and
plant
my
vineyards
the
hundred
thousand
is
mine
the
daily
was
yours
adieu
noble
spinners
drink
my
health
with
this
groat
each
which
i
give
you
over
and
above
this
account
of
the
manufacturing
buccaneer
is
a
picture
drawn
by
a
man
of
genius
from
his
imagination
there
are
probably
many
readers
who
believe
the
picture
to
be
drawn
from
fact
there
may
of
course
be
masters
who
are
buccaneers
but
there
are
also
masters
who
are
not
buccaneers
there
are
dishonest
manufacturers
as
there
are
dishonest
literary
men
dishonest
publicans
dishonest
tradesmen
but
we
must
believe
that
in
all
occupations
honesty
is
the
rule
and
dishonesty
the
exception
at
all
events
it
is
better
that
we
should
know
what
the
manufacturers
really
are
from
fact
rather
than
from
fiction
let
us
first
take
a
large
manufacturing
firm
or
rather
series
of
firms
well
known
in
south
lancashire
we
mean
the
mills
of
the
ashworth
at
egerton
and
new
eagley
they
have
been
in
existence
for
more
than
seventy
years
they
have
been
repeatedly
enlarged
and
increasing
numbers
of
workpeople
have
been
employed
at
the
uniform
wages
paid
throughout
the
district
workmen
earn
from
seventeen
shillings
to
two
pounds
a
week
can
earn
as
much
as
shillings
a
week
where
the
parents
have
children
the
united
earnings
of
families
amount
to
as
much
as
from
to
a
year
then
as
to
what
the
ashworths
have
done
for
the
benefit
of
their
workpeople
schooling
by
means
of
mutual
instruction
classes
was
in
operation
from
the
first
but
about
the
year
when
the
works
were
greatly
enlarged
and
the
population
was
considerably
increased
a
day
school
was
opened
for
children
which
was
used
as
an
evening
school
for
young
men
as
well
as
for
a
the
continued
extension
of
the
works
led
to
an
enlargement
of
the
school
accommodation
and
while
this
was
being
provided
arrangements
were
made
for
a
library
and
for
the
performance
of
divine
worship
on
sundays
a
was
also
provided
for
the
use
of
young
people
misgivings
were
not
unfrequently
expressed
that
the
zeal
and
expenditure
incurred
by
the
ashworth
might
one
day
be
turned
against
them
to
their
annoyance
and
pecuniary
loss
the
prediction
was
realized
in
only
a
single
instance
a
young
man
of
considerable
talent
who
when
a
child
had
been
removed
to
the
factory
from
a
neighbouring
workhouse
made
very
rapid
progress
at
school
especially
in
arithmetic
and
when
a
strike
of
the
workpeople
occurred
in
one
of
the
great
strike
years
he
became
very
officious
as
a
leader
the
strike
was
defeated
by
the
employment
of
new
hands
and
it
was
attributed
to
the
influence
of
this
young
man
that
the
employed
were
brutally
assailed
by
an
infuriated
mob
and
that
the
windows
of
the
schoolroom
were
smashed
and
other
works
of
destruction
committed
the
employers
nevertheless
pursued
their
original
design
they
repaired
the
and
endeavoured
to
increase
the
efficacy
of
the
teaching
they
believed
that
nothing
was
better
calculated
to
remove
ignorant
infatuation
than
increased
schooling
in
a
great
many
instances
the
heads
of
the
families
had
previously
been
engaged
as
weavers
or
in
some
pastoral
pursuit
and
it
became
evident
that
in
course
of
time
the
exercise
of
their
minds
in
the
details
of
a
new
pursuit
awakened
their
intelligence
and
their
general
demeanour
indicated
marks
of
a
higher
cultivation
the
new
eagley
mills
being
situated
in
a
narrow
valley
several
miles
from
bolton
and
the
property
being
in
the
possession
of
the
owners
they
forbade
the
opening
of
any
tavern
or
beerhouse
on
the
estate
so
that
the
district
became
distinguished
for
the
order
and
sobriety
of
the
inhabitants
a
man
of
intemperate
habits
has
little
chance
of
remaining
in
the
ashworth
villages
he
is
expelled
not
by
the
employers
but
by
the
men
themselves
he
must
conform
to
the
sober
habits
of
the
place
or
decamp
to
some
larger
town
where
his
vices
may
be
hidden
in
the
crowd
many
of
the
parents
have
expressed
how
much
gratification
they
have
felt
that
by
reason
of
the
isolated
situation
they
enjoyed
as
a
community
they
had
become
so
completely
separated
from
the
corrupt
influences
of
music
saloons
and
the
masters
have
added
to
their
other
obligations
to
the
workpeople
the
erection
of
comfortable
cottages
for
their
accommodation
they
are
built
of
stone
and
are
some
have
two
upper
bedrooms
and
others
have
three
on
the
ground
floor
there
is
a
a
and
a
scullery
with
a
walled
courtyard
enclosing
the
whole
premises
the
proprietor
pays
the
and
other
local
charges
and
the
rentals
of
the
houses
vary
from
to
a
week
the
regularity
of
their
employment
accompanied
with
the
payment
of
wages
on
friday
night
doubtless
promoted
their
local
attachment
to
the
place
many
of
the
descendants
of
the
first
comers
remain
on
the
spot
their
social
relations
have
been
promoted
intermarriages
have
been
frequent
and
during
the
whole
period
there
has
not
been
a
single
prosecution
for
theft
the
working
people
have
also
thriven
as
well
as
their
masters
great
numbers
of
them
are
known
to
possess
reserved
funds
in
savings
banks
and
other
depositories
for
savings
and
there
are
others
of
them
who
have
invested
their
money
in
cottage
buildings
and
in
various
other
ways
but
have
not
the
men
risen
above
their
lot
of
labouring
spinners
they
have
such
of
them
as
possessed
skill
ability
and
the
faculty
of
organization
have
been
promoted
from
the
ranks
of
labourers
and
have
become
mill
managers
about
of
these
says
henry
ashworth
have
been
reckoned
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
of
them
have
become
business
partners
or
proprietors
of
mills
many
manufacturers
adds
ashworth
are
to
be
found
who
have
done
a
great
deal
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
those
they
have
employed
and
no
one
will
doubt
that
they
have
been
prompted
not
by
hopes
of
gain
but
by
emotions
of
goodwill

manufacturers
such
as
these
do
not
like
plugson
of
dolly
undershot
gather
up
their
fortunes
and
run
away
leaving
a
groat
each
to
their
workpeople
to
drink
their
healths
they
remain
with
them
from
generation
to
generation
the
best
and
the
noblest
amongst
them
the
ashworths
of
turton
the
strutts
of
derby
the
marshalls
of
leeds
the
akroyds
of
halifax
the
brooks
of
huddersfield
and
many
others
have
continued
to
superintend
their
works
for
several
generations
the
strutts
were
the
partners
of
arkwright
who
was
almost
the
beginner
of
english
manufacture
in
fact
it
is
only
since
arkwright
took
out
his
patent
for
the
spinning
machine
and
watt
took
out
his
patent
for
the
steam
engine
that
england
has
become
a
manufacturing
country
where
would
england
have
been
now
but
for
the
energy
enterprise
and
public
spirit
of
our
manufacturers
could
agriculture
have
supported
the
continuous
increase
of
population
is
it
not
more
probable
that
this
country
would
have
become
overrun
by
beggars
or
that
property
would
have
been
assailed
and
the
constitution
upset
as
was
the
case
in
france
but
for
the
extensive
and
remunerative
employment
afforded
to
the
labouring
classes
in
the
manufacturing
districts
the
steam
engine
has
indeed
proved
the
of
england
it
enabled
the
kingdom
to
hold
its
ground
firmly
during
the
continental
wars
and
but
for
it
and
the
industries
which
it
has
established
england
would
probably
by
this
time
have
sunk
to
the
condition
of
a
third
or
power
it
is
true
the
great
manufacturers
have
become
wealthy
but
it
would
certainly
have
been
singular
if
with
their
industry
energy
and
powers
of
organization
they
had
become
poor
men
of
the
stamp
of
the
strutts
ashworths
marshalls
and
others
do
not
work
for
wealth
merely
though
wealth
comes
to
them
they
have
not
become
great
because
they
were
rich
but
they
have
become
rich
because
they
were
great
accumulations
of
wealth
are
the
result
of
exceptional
industry
organization
and
thrift
rather
than
of
exceptional
gain
adam
smith
has
said
it
seldom
happens
that
great
fortunes
are
made
by
any
one
and
branch
of
business
but
in
consequence
of
a
long
life
of
industry
frugality
and
attention
but
it
is
not
always
so
for
instance
lister
of
bradford
after
inventing
the
combing
machine
or
at
least
combining
the
inventions
of
others
into
a
complete
combing
machine
of
his
own
proceeded
to
invent
a
machine
for
using
up
silk
waste
then
cast
away
as
useless
spinning
it
into
silk
of
the
finest
kind
and
by
means
of
the
to
weave
it
into
velvet
of
the
best
quality
the
attempt
had
never
before
been
made
by
any
inventor
and
it
seemed
to
be
of
insuperable
difficulty
lister
had
already
made
a
fortune
by
the
success
of
his
combing
machine
such
as
to
enable
him
to
retire
from
business
and
live
in
comfort
for
the
rest
of
his
life
but
urged
by
the
irrepressible
spirit
of
the
inventor
he
went
onward
with
his
silk
machine
as
he
himself
said
at
a
recent
meeting
at
bradford
they
might
judge
how
hard
he
had
worked
to
conquer
the
difficulties
which
beset
him
when
he
told
them
that
for
twenty
years
he
had
never
been
in
bed
at
five
in
the
morning
in
fact
he
did
not
think
there
was
a
man
in
england
who
had
worked
harder
than
he
had
the
most
remarkable
thing
was
that
he
threw
away
an
immense
fortune
before
there
was
any
probability
of
his
succeeding
he
had
almost
brought
himself
to
ruin
for
he
was
out
of
pocket
before
he
even
made
a
shilling
by
his
machine
indeed
he
wrote
off
a
quarter
of
a
million
as
entirely
lost
before
he
began
to
make
up
his
books
again
since
then
his
patent
for
the
manufacture
of
silk
had
turned
out
one
of
the
most
successful
of
the
day
footnote
the
meeting
was
held
to
receive
the
transfer
of
lister
fine
park
at
manningham
which
he
had
presented
to
the
corporation
of
bradford
to
be
a
people
park
for
ever
in
the
park
presented
by
lister
to
the
people
of
bradford
a
statue
was
recently
erected
by
public
subscription
it
was
unveiled
by
the
right
hon
forster
who
in
closing
his
speech
observed
i
doubt
after
all
whether
we
are
come
here
to
do
honour
to
lister
so
much
as
to
do
honour
to
ourselves
we
wish
to
do
honour
to
those
working
faculties
which
have
made
our
country
of
england
a
practical
and
therefore
a
great
and
prosperous
and
a
powerful
country
it
is
this
untiring
unresting
industry
which
lister
possesses
this
practical
understanding
this
determination
to
carry
out
any
object
which
he
is
convinced
ought
to
be
carried
out
and
his
determination
to
fear
no
opposition
and
to
care
for
no
obstacle
it
is
these
practical
faculties
that
have
made
england
what
she
is
what
is
it
especially
that
we
are
honouring
it
is
the
pluck
which
this
man
has
shown
it
is
the
feeling
that
having
to
do
with
the
worsted
trade
he
said
to
himself
is
something
which
ought
to
be
done
i
will
not
rest
until
i
have
found
out
how
it
can
be
done
and
having
found
out
how
it
can
be
done
where
is
the
man
who
shall
stop
my
doing
it
now
it
was
upon
that
principle
that
he
fought
his
long
struggle
and
so
when
we
read
the
story
of
his
struggles
ever
since
in
those
two
great
inventions
we
raise
this
statue
to
the
man
who
has
successfully
fought
the
battle
and
hope
that
our
sons
and
the
sons
of
all
rich
and
poor
together
will
come
in
to
admire
it
not
merely
because
it
gives
them
the
form
and
features
of
a
rich
and
successful
man
but
because
it
gives
them
the
form
and
features
of
a
man
who
was
endowed
with
industry
with
intellect
with
energy
with
courage
with
perseverance
who
spared
himself
no
pains
in
first
ascertaining
the
conditions
of
the
problems
he
had
to
solve
and
then
whose
heart
never
fainted
whose
will
never
relaxed
in
determining
to
carry
out
those
conditions
great
men
are
wise
savers
and
wise
spenders
montesquieu
has
said
of
alexander
he
found
the
first
means
of
his
prosperity
and
power
in
the
greatness
of
his
genius
the
second
in
his
frugality
and
private
economy
and
the
third
in
his
immense
liberality
to
accomplish
great
objects
he
spent
but
little
on
himself
but
for
public
purposes
his
hand
was
always
open
it
was
also
said
of
the
first
napoleon
that
he
was
economical
like
charlemagne
because
he
was
great
like
charlemagne
napoleon
was
by
no
means
a
spendthrift
except
in
war
but
he
spent
largely
in
accomplishing
great
public
undertakings
in
cases
such
as
these
economy
and
generosity
are
well
combined
and
so
it
is
in
the
cases
of
all
men
possessed
of
energy
industry
and
great
powers
of
organization
it
may
seem
out
of
keeping
to
compare
great
producers
with
great
commanders
yet
the
manufacturer
often
requires
as
much
courage
as
much
genius
as
much
organizing
power
as
the
warrior
the
one
considers
how
he
shall
keep
his
operatives
in
working
order
the
other
how
he
shall
keep
his
soldiers
in
fighting
order
both
must
be
men
of
enterprize
of
boldness
of
keen
observation
and
close
attention
to
details
and
the
manufacturer
from
his
position
needs
to
be
the
most
benevolent
man
of
the
two
viewed
in
this
light
we
regard
sir
titus
salt
not
only
as
a
captain
of
industry
but
as
a
of
industry
he
has
been
called
the
prince
of
manufacturers
titus
salt
is
a
son
of
a
yorkshire
in
the
early
part
of
his
life
he
was
a
farmer
near
bradford
and
his
inclination
for
agricultural
pursuits
was
such
that
it
was
thought
he
would
continue
to
pursue
this
vocation
being
however
a
partner
with
his
father
in
the
wool
business
and
observing
that
manufactures
were
rapidly
extending
in
the
neighbourhood
he
withdrew
from
the
partnership
and
commenced
business
at
bradford
as
a
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
observe
the
uses
of
alpaca
wool
large
quantities
of
that
material
were
stored
at
liverpool
imported
from
the
brazils
but
the
wool
found
no
purchasers
until
at
length
salt
bought
a
quantity
and
spun
it
into
an
entirely
new
fabric
he
then
proceeded
to
buy
up
all
the
alpaca
that
was
to
be
found
at
liverpool
made
arrangements
for
purchasing
all
that
came
into
the
market
went
on
spinning
alpaca
and
eventually
established
the
manufacture
this
was
the
foundation
of
fortune
at
length
after
about
twenty
years
labour
as
a
manufacturer
salt
thought
of
retiring
from
business
and
again
betaking
himself
to
his
favourite
agricultural
pursuits
he
intended
to
retire
on
his
fiftieth
birthday
but
before
that
time
had
arrived
having
five
sons
to
provide
for
he
reversed
his
decision
and
resolved
to
continue
in
business
a
little
longer
and
to
remain
at
the
head
of
the
firm
having
come
to
this
determination
he
made
up
his
mind
to
leave
bradford
the
borough
was
already
overcrowded
and
he
did
not
like
to
be
a
party
to
increasing
the
population
he
looked
about
for
a
site
suitable
for
a
manufacturing
establishment
and
at
length
fixed
upon
a
large
piece
of
ground
in
the
beautiful
valley
of
the
aire
an
extension
of
the
leeds
and
bradford
railway
was
in
front
and
the
leeds
and
liverpool
canal
behind
it
so
that
there
was
every
convenience
for
bringing
up
the
raw
materials
and
of
sending
away
the
manufactured
goods
on
that
spot
saltaire
was
erected
a
noble
monument
of
private
enterprise
liberality
and
wisdom
it
is
not
necessary
to
describe
saltaire
the
buildings
connected
with
the
new
works
cover
six
and
a
half
acres
the
principal
room
is
five
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
the
weaving
shed
covers
two
acres
the
combing
shed
occupies
one
acre
everything
is
large
roomy
and
substantial
the
cost
of
constructing
the
factory
and
the
dwellings
for
the
workpeople
amounted
to
more
than
a
hundred
and
forty
thousand
pounds
on
the
opening
day
salt
dined
three
thousand
five
hundred
persons
in
the
combing
shed
at
the
dinner
he
said
i
can
not
look
around
me
and
see
this
vast
assemblage
of
friends
and
workpeople
without
being
moved
i
feel
greatly
honoured
by
the
presence
of
the
nobleman
at
my
side
i
am
especially
delighted
at
the
presence
of
my
workpeople
i
hope
to
draw
around
me
a
population
that
will
enjoy
the
beauties
of
this
neighbourhood
a
population
of
contented
happy
operatives
i
have
given
instructions
to
my
architects
that
nothing
is
to
be
spared
to
render
the
dwellings
of
the
operatives
a
pattern
to
the
country
and
if
my
life
is
spared
by
divine
providence
i
hope
to
see
satisfaction
contentment
and
happiness
around
me
this
promise
has
been
amply
fulfilled
salt
has
been
influenced
throughout
by
his
sense
of
duty
and
responsibility
when
he
was
applied
to
by
the
french
government
for
information
as
to
his
factory
he
replied
what
has
been
attempted
at
saltaire
arose
from
my
own
private
feeling
and
judgment
without
the
most
remote
idea
that
it
would
be
made
the
subject
of
public
interest
and
inquiry
with
respect
to
the
factory
itself
little
need
be
said
the
object
of
its
construction
is
to
save
time
in
the
process
of
production
not
a
minute
is
lost
in
pushing
the
material
from
one
department
to
another
every
of
steam
is
made
to
do
its
utmost
every
moment
of
time
is
economized
and
the
productive
capabilities
of
the
factory
are
thus
greatly
increased
we
prefer
to
speak
of
the
immense
improvement
which
salt
or
rather
sir
titus
salt
has
effected
in
the
physical
and
moral
condition
of
his
workpeople
the
plan
of
the
works
shows
that
saltaire
has
been
provided
with
a
church
a
wesleyan
chapel
and
a
literary
and
philosophical
institution
large
schools
have
been
provided
for
boys
girls
and
infants
with
abundance
of
for
young
men
as
well
as
old
there
is
a

surrounded
by

is
also
a
large

for
pensioners
about
three
thousand
persons
are
employed
in
the
works
and
seven
hundred

houses
have
been
erected
for
their
accommodation
the
rents
run
from
two
and
fourpence
to
seven
and
sixpence
a
week
according
to
the
accommodation
some
of
the
houses
are
used
as
the
rents
include

is
sold
at
a
low
price

scullery
a
pantry
and
cellar
and
three
bedrooms
each
house
has

such
as

the

the

there
are

warm

turkish

and
the

enable
the

to
wash
their

away
from

is
a
great
accommodation
inasmuch
as
indoor
washing
is
most
pernicious
and
a
fruitful

of

to
which
a
large

inclusive
of

works
has

the
haley

horticultural
and
floral
society
one
of
the
most
thriving
institutions
of
the
kind
in
the
neighbourhood
in
short
akroyd
has
done
everything
that
a
wise
and
conscientious
master
could
have
done
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
the
moral
and
spiritual
welfare
of
the
four
thousand
persons
employed
in
his
manufactories
who
have
been
virtually
committed
to
his
charge
but
although
akroyd
has
done
so
much
as
a
master
for
the
men
and
women
employed
by
him
he
has
perhaps
done
still
more
as
a
public
benefactor
by
establishing
the
yorkshire
penny
bank
for
savings
as
early
as
the
year
akroyd
instituted
a
savings
bank
to
enable
his
workpeople
to
deposit
sums
of
from
one
penny
upwards
the
system
was
found
to
work
so
well
and
to
have
such
a
beneficial
effect
in
making
people
provident
that
he
conceived
the
idea
of
extending
its
operations
throughout
the
west
riding
of
yorkshire
having
obtained
the
of
several
influential
gentlemen
the
scheme
was
started
in
and
an
act
of
parliament
was
obtained
for
constituting
the
yorkshire
penny
savings
bank
as
it
now
exists
akroyd
has
recently
furnished
an
introduction
to
the
narrative
of
the
yorkshire
penny
bank
from
which
we
extract
the
following
passage
the
way
by
which
thoughts
or
chance
suggestions
enter
into
the
minds
of
men
is
sometimes
passing
strange
they
may
be
the
offspring
of
wayward
fancy
or
they
may
be
the
whisperings
from
a
higher
source
to
the
latter
cause
i
am
willing
to
attribute
the
idea
which
flashed
across
my
mind
during
the
present
year
to
give
to
the
public
something
beyond
the
bare
outline
of
the
scheme
in
which
for
years
many
of
them
have
taken
a
warm
personal
interest
it
occurred
in
this
wise
when
in
town
i
occasionally
attended
during
lent
the
services
at
whitehall
chapel
for
the
sake
of
hearing
a
lenten
sermon
preached
by
one
of
her
majesty
chaplains
one
remarkable
sermon
of
the
series
was
delivered
by
the
rev
charles
kingsley
on
the
of
march
on
behalf
of
the
supplemental
ladies
association
of
the
london
society
of
parochial
mission
women
in
the
sketch
which
the
preacher
gave
of
this
excellent
institution
he
referred
to
a
book
entitled
and
west
in
which
the
benefits
derived
by
the
london
poor
from
the
association
are
clearly
set
forth
but
he
dwelt
chiefly
on
the
wide
separation
which
divides
rich
from
poor
class
from
class
in
london
and
on
the
dangers
which
threaten
society
from
this
cause
as
was
recently
exemplified
in
france
such
was
the
impression
made
upon
me
by
the
sermon
that
before
many
days
had
elapsed
i
had
purchased
and
west
and
given
the
book
a
careful
perusal
from
previous
observation
i
had
been
struck
with
the
sad
contrast
between
the
luxurious
lives
of
those
who
reside
at
the
west
end
of
london
and
the
struggle
for
a
hard
wretched
existence
which
the
crowded
poor
at
the
east
or
in
close
purlieus
elsewhere
are
obliged
to
maintain
until
death
closes
the
scene
how
to
bridge
over
the
wide
chasm
intervening
between
the
extremes
of
high
and
low
in
society
without
injury
to
on
either
side
was
the
puzzling
question
the
problem
to
be
solved
yet
from
the
admirable
introduction
to
this
most
useful
little
work
by
the
countess
spencer
it
appeared
that
a
lady
of
high
rank
and
her
associates
had
in
some
measure
solved
the
problem
and
bridged
over
the
chasm
hence
i
was
led
to
reflect
how
much
easier
it
is
to
discharge
our
duty
to
our
neighbours
and
to
fulfil
the
leading
object
of
the
parochial
mission
women
association
to
the
poor
to
help
themselves
in
provincial
towns
and
in
the
country
where
we
are
personally
acquainted
with
each
other
than
in
london
where
we
do
not
know
our
neighbour
help
the
poor
to
help
is
the
cardinal
principle
of
the
yorkshire
penny
bank
footnote

a
narrative
with
an
introduction
by
edward
akroyd
the
business
of
the
bank
commenced
on
the
of
may
at
the
end
of
the
year
when
the
bank
had
been
in
operation
seven
months
branches
had
been
opened
it
went
on
increasing
in
the
number
of
branches
and
depositors
and
in
the
amounts
deposited
in
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
branches
had
been
established
and
the
amount
of
investments
in
the
names
of
trustees
had
reached
nearly
four
hundred
thousand
pounds
the
yorkshire
penny
bank
does
not
interfere
with
the
post
office
savings
bank
it
has
a
special
function
that
of
teaching
the
young
of
either
sex
habit
of
it
is
also
convenient
to
the
adult
worker
as
a
convenient
receptacle
for
his
savings
many
have
been
induced
to
save
in
consequence
of
the
banks
having
been
brought
almost
to
their
very
doors
one
of
the
most
remarkable
facts
connected
with
the
history
of
penny
banks
is
the
sympathetic
influence
of
juvenile
thrift
upon
paternal
recklessness
and
intemperance
the
fact
is
well
worthy
the
consideration
of
temperance
advocates
who
would
probably
effect
much
greater
practical
good
by
enabling
working
people
to
save
their
money
in
the
penny
banks
than
by
any
agency
take
for
instance
the
following
illustrations
from
akroyd
narrative
an
actuary
says
all
the
juvenile
depositors
seem
inclined
to
take
care
of
their
pence
by
depositing
them
in
the
bank
and
the
people
have
become
of
the
same
turn
of
mind
rather
than
carry
their
loose
money
to
the
or
spend
it
foolishly
some
factory
operatives
have
saved
sufficient
to
buy
stock
and
commence
farming
another
actuary
says
a
drunken
father
being
shamed
out
of
his
drunkenness
by
the
deposits
of
his
children
now
deposits
a
week
in
the
bank
a
notoriously
bad
man
a
collier
became
a
regular
depositor
himself
as
well
as
depositing
money
in
the
name
of
his
child
all
his
spare
money
having
previously
been
spent
in
drink
from
the
date
of
his
beginning
to
save
a
perceptible
improvement
took
place
in
his
conduct
and
character
in
another
case
two
boys
prevailed
upon
their
father
also
a
collier
to
allow
them
to
deposit
a
shilling
a
week
until
they
had
saved
sufficient
to
buy
themselves
each
a
suit
of
new
clothes
before
then
all
their
father
earnings
as
well
as
their
own
had
been
spent
in
drink
an
actuary
of
another
branch
says
he
has
seen
fathers
and
mothers
who
have
been
drunkards
send
their
children
with
money
to
the
bank
he
says
my
heart
was
made
to
rejoice
when
i
saw
a
boy
who
never
had
a
suit
of
new
clothes
in
his
life
draw
out
his
money
and
in
less
than
two
hours
return
well
clad
to
take
his
place
in
the
school
to
practise
singing
for
good
friday
at
the
meeting
of
the
band
of
hope
on
good
friday
he
asked
the
parents
and
children
to
signify
by
holding
up
their
hands
whether
or
not
the
bank
had
been
beneficial
to
them
when
many
hands
were
instantly
raised
one
poor
mother
exclaiming
will
put
up
both
my
hands
for
my
two
bairns
a
miner
the
father
of
a
family
reclaimed
from
drunkenness
saved
his
money
in
the
bank
until
with
the
aid
of
a
loan
from
a
building
society
he
built
two
houses
at
a
cost
of
four
hundred
pounds
the
bank
has
been
to
many
people
what
the
hive
is
to
the
bee
a
kind
of
repository
and
when
the
wintry
days
of
sickness
or
adversity
befall
them
they
have
then
the
bank
to
flee
to
for
succour
a
missionary
says
i
met
a
man
and
his
wife
about
two
years
ago
both
drunk
i
got
them
to
sign
the
pledge
and
since
then
to
invest
their
money
in
our
bank
the
pawnbroker
had
got
the
greater
part
of
their
goods
but
i
am
happy
to
say
that
they
have
got
all
the
articles
out
of
pawn
and
can
bring
a
little
money
almost
every
week
to
the
bank
and
when
putting
in
the
money
the
man
says
that
it
is
better
than
taking
it
to
the
their
home
is
now
a
very
comfortable
one
a
drunkard
one
night
came
to
the
bank
and
flinging
down
a
shilling
for
a
start
said
there
that
is
the
price
of
six
pints
of
beer
but
i
promise
the
landlords
that
they
sha
have
as
much
of
my
money
as
they
have
had
this
man
has
become
sober
and
continues
a
regular
depositor
in
another
bank
a
man
who
had
been
a
reckless
and
desperate
fellow
was
induced
by
his
wife
to
deposit
a
few
coppers
in
the
bank
he
did
so
and
his
weekly
deposits
increased
while
at
the
same
time
his
visits
to
the
decreased
in
the
course
of
a
short
time
he
had
a
respectable
balance
to
his
credit
and
this
induced
him
to
take
a
share
in
a
building
society
and
then
a
second
share
after
continuing
to
pay
upon
these
shares
for
some
time
he
purchased
a
piece
of
land
upon
which
he
built
two
houses
one
of
these
he
occupies
himself
and
the
other
he
lets
besides
this
he
is
now
a
respectable
tradesman
having
two
or
three
journeymen
and
an
apprentice
working
for
him
he
is
sober
and
steady
and
much
respected
by
his
friends
and
neighbours
many
other
cases
of
the
same
kind
might
be
mentioned
in
one
case
a
boy
saved
sufficient
money
to
buy
a
suit
of
clothes
for
his
father
who
had
spent
all
his
earnings
in
drink
and
reduced
himself
and
his
family
to
poverty
in
other
cases
sons
and
daughters
maintain
their
infirm
parents
without
resorting
to
the
parochial
board
for
assistance
some
save
for
one
thing
some
for
another
some
save
to
emigrate
some
to
buy
clothes
some
to
buy
a
watch
but
in
all
cases
frugality
is
trained
until
saving
becomes
habitual
one
of
the
yorkshire
actuaries
of
the
penny
bank
tells
the
following
anecdote
as
conveying
a
lesson
of
perseverance
and
encouragement
to
branch
managers
smith
was
one
of
our
first
managers
but
after
attending
two
or
three
times
he
left
us
saying
it
was
work
my
answer
was
is
with
children
we
have
to
do
a
short
time
after
i
met
him
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
i
observed
that
i
sometimes
got
in
the
and
did
not
know
whether
we
were
doing
any
good
and
felt
disposed
to
give
up
the
bank
on
which
he
warmly
replied
god
sake
you
must
not
let
such
an
idea
get
into
your
head
you
little
know
the
good
you
are
doing
we
have
not
a
man
about
our
place
but
either
himself
or
some
members
of
his
family
are
depositors
the
actuary
adds
if
colonel
akroyd
ever
despairs
i
give
him
the
above
answer
savings
banks
have
thus
been
the
means
of
doing
an
immense
amount
of
good
they
have
brought
peace
happiness
and
comfort
into
many
thousands
of
families
the
example
of
akroyd
should
be
largely
imitated
and
there
ought
not
to
be
a
county
in
the
kingdom
without
its
organized
system

there
are
several
large
employers
who
have
endeavoured
to
combine
the
principle
of
with
the
business
of
manufacturing
and
to
furnish
to
the
men
who
have
contributed
to
their
past
prosperity
the
opportunity
of
sharing
in
their
future
profits
the
object
of
these
masters
has
been
to
obviate
the
antagonism
between
capital
and
labour
and
to
spread
the
spirit
of
contentment
among
the
operatives
workmen
who
have
saved
their
earnings
and
stored
them
in
savings
banks
are
in
this
manner
enabled
to
become
partners
in
the
concerns
in
which
they
have
formerly
employed
their
labour
the
two
principal
manufacturing
concerns
of
halifax
those
of
james
akroyd
and
son
and
john
crossley
and
sons
have
thus
become
converted
into
joint
stock
companies
they
have
been
so
converted
with
the
primary
design
of
receiving
the
of
the
managers
workmen
and
others
associated
with
them
and
with
that
view
the
directors
have
in
all
cases
given
them
the
priority
in
the
allotment
of
the
shares
we
have
already
referred
to
the
philanthropic
work
accomplished
by
edward
akroyd
in
the
county
of
york
we
have
now
to
refer
to
the
crossley
firm
whose
carpets
are
known
throughout
the
world
we
refer
to
them
with
the
greater
pleasure
as
their
history
contains
a
story
which
may
possibly
add
to
the
interest
of
this
book
which
however
useful
some
readers
may
consider
to
be
rather
dull
to
read
the
founder
of
this
firm
was
john
crossley
he
belonged
to
an
old
yorkshire
family
his
grandfather
who
lived
at
king
cross
near
halifax
was
born
of
respectable
parents
and
had
a
good
education
yet
he
was
by
no
means
fond
of
business
in
fact
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
time
in
hunting
and
shooting
his
wife
was
however
of
a
very
different
character
she
was
industrious
energetic
and
an
excellent
household
manager
she
not
only
maintained
herself
but
her
husband
and
her
family
she
did
this
by
means
of
a
boarding
school
which
she
kept
one
of
the
best
in
the
neighbourhood
of
halifax
one
of
her
sons
the
father
of
john
crossley
was
brought
up
to
he
learnt
his
business
with
webster
of
one
of
whose
daughters
he
afterwards
married
john
crossley
himself
also
became
a
with
his
uncle
and
when
his
apprenticeship
was
finished
he
went
to
weave
for
currer
a
large
carpet
manufacturer
at
luddenden
foot
while
working
at
this
factory
his
master
built
a
large
fine
house
to
live
in
he
thought
he
had
money
enough
saved
for
the
purpose
but
circumstances
proved
that
he
had
not
currer
told
his
foreman
that
he
had
kept
an
account
of
its
cost
until
he
had
spent
and
then
he
became
so
disgusted
that
he
burnt
the
memorandum
book
although
the
house
was
not
nearly
finished
he
said
he
had
done
all
that
to
please
a
woman
meaning
his
wife
although
currer
was
an
excellent
man
of
business
his
wife
was
too
fond
of
show
and
the
large
fine
house
in
which
she
was
to
live
proved
her
husband
ruin
he
died
shortly
after
it
was
finished
and
then
the
whole
of
his
establishment
was
broken
up
after
leaving
currer
john
crossley
removed
to
halifax
to
take
the
management
of
job
lees
carpet
manufactory
in
lower
george
yard
halifax
he
began
to
look
out
for
a
wife
and
the
history
of
his
courtship
is
curious
as
well
as
interesting
the
crossleys
seem
to
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
fall
in
with
excellent
wives
and
the
prosperity
of
the
family
is
quite
as
much
due
to
the
crossley
women
as
to
the
crossley
men
martha
crossley
the
future
wife
of
john
crossley
was
born
at
folly
hall
near
the
ambler
thorn
bar
her
thomas
turner
was
a
farmer
he
lived
at
the
upper
scout
hall
shibden
and
the
which
he
occupied
at
the
head
of
the
shibden
valley
is
still
in
existence
the
eldest
son
was
brought
up
to
his
business
the
youngest
son
abraham
was
brought
up
to
farming
weaving
and
combing
he
married
and
had
three
children
abraham
thomas
and
martha
abraham
the
eldest
was
father
of
john
crossley
turner
abraham
was
also
brought
up
to
farming
and
manufacturing
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
manufacturing
was
in
those
days
conducted
on
a
very
much
smaller
scale
than
it
is
now
he
afterwards
went
into
partnership
with
his
brother
thomas
to
make
worsted
goods
but
after
his
marriage
the
partnership
was
dissolved
he
then
became
the
proprietor
of
the
scout
farm
and
there
brought
up
his
family
although
abraham
turner
was
a
landed
proprietor
he
did
not
think
it
beneath
him
to
allow
his
daughter
martha
to
go
out
to
service
when
about
fifteen
years
old
she
went
as
a
servant
to
miss
oldfield
at
warley
in
that
service
in
her
own
person
she
did
the
work
of
kitchenmaid
housemaid
and
cook
and
in
addition
to
that
she
milked
four
or
five
cows
night
and
morning
she
remained
about
ten
years
with
miss
oldfield
her
wages
were
at
first
a
week
after
two
years
they
were
increased
to
and
after
nine
service
they
were
increased
to
six
guineas
a
year
yet
during
that
time
martha
turner
saved
thirty
pounds
by
sheer
thrift
john
crossley
the
founder
of
the
crossley
firm
and
the
husband
of
martha
turner
was
originally
a
one
night
when
working
at
the
loom
he
was
taking
his
drinking
and
on
laying
down
his
black
bottle
it
fell
and
broke
in
trying
to
catch
the
bottle
he
cut
his
arm
so
severely
that
it
was
thought
he
would
have
bled
to
death
he
could
not
work
at
the
loom
any
longer
and
he
was
going
about
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
when
his
employer
currer
said
to
him
john
do
you
think
you
could
tie
up
a
loom
as
you
can
not
now
weave
john
replied
that
he
thought
he
could
he
tried
and
proved
so
expert
that
his
master
would
not
allow
him
to
go
back
to
the
loom
john
crossley
used
to
regard
the
accident
to
his
arm
as
the
in
his
life
in
the
meantime
he
was
going
on
with
the
business
of
courtship
though
it
was
very
much
against
the
wish
of
the
proud
farmer
the
father
of
martha
turner
he
declared
that
he
would
never
allow
his
daughter
to
marry
a
weaver
or
even
a
foreman
of
weavers
perhaps
the
story
of
their
courtship
is
best
told
in
martha
own
words
when
i
went
to
the
gate
one
evening
there
was
a
young
man
standing
there
who
asked
me
if
i
wanted
a
sweetheart
i
answered
i
marry
i
want
no
sweethearts
i
then
went
into
the
house
and
left
him
i
saw
the
same
young
man
frequently
about
but
did
not
speak
to
him
for
years
after
his
name
was
john
crossley
when
my
mistress
ascertained
his
object
she
did
all
she
could
to
set
me
against
him
she
told
me
that
when
she
was
a
girl
she
had
gone
to
a
kept
by
a
crossley
that
her
husband
name
was
tom
crossley
the
grandfather
of
this
very
man
that
was
courting
me
and
that
a
wilder
idler
scapegrace
she
never
knew
she
always
said
when
she
saw
him
coming
young
crossley
come
again
one
day
i
received
a
from
him
which
i
could
now
repeat
word
for
word
i
had
several
other
suitors
but
none
were
so
persevering
as
john
crossley
he
pressed
me
very
much
to
have
him
at
last
he
sent
me
a
letter
to
say
that
a
house
was
vacant
in
lower
george
yard
close
to
the
works
he
was
managing
and
that
it
was
a
great
chance
to
meet
with
one
so
convenient
i
told
him
that
i
was
going
home
to
spend
the
of
november
and
would
pass
that
way
and
look
at
the
house
which
i
did
when
i
got
home
i
asked
my
parents
for
their
consent
they
did
not
object
much
to
it
at
the
time
but
i
had
not
been
at
miss
more
than
a
day
or
two
before
they
sent
over
my
sister
grace
to
say
that
they
would
not
give
their
consent
to
the
match
and
that
if
i
insisted
on
being
married
to
john
crossley
they
would
never
look
me
in
the
face
again
so
soon
as
my
sister
was
gone
i
retired
in
a
most
distressed
state
of
feeling
to
my
bedroom
and
opened
my
book
that
was
the
preparation
for
the
sacrament
and
the
first
place
at
which
i
opened
i
read
these
words
thy
father
and
thy
mother
forsake
thee
then
the
lord
will
take
thee
up
this
comforted
me
very
much
i
felt
that
the
lord
was
with
me
in
this
matter
and
i
could
no
longer
doubt
which
was
the
path
of
duty
i
decided
to
accept
john
crossley
offer
and
we
were
married
on
the
day
of
january
crossley
never
did
a
better
day
work
than
in
marrying
his
excellent
and
noble
wife
from
that
day
forward
she
was
his
helper
his
his
consoler
she
assisted
her
husband
in
all
his
struggles
and
in
a
certain
sense
she
was
the
backbone
of
the
crossley
family
after
the
death
of
job
lees
whose
carpet
manufactory
he
had
managed
crossley
entered
into
partnership
with
two
other
persons
to
take
the
plant
and
carry
on
the
business
some
difference
having
occurred
with
the
partners
he
left
the
firm
and
took
a
lease
of
dean
clough
mill
where
he
entered
into
another
partnership
with
his
brother
thomas
and
james
travers
there
they
carried
on
the
business
of
worsted
spinning
at
the
same
time
john
crossley
continued
to
spin
and
dye
the
yarns
and
to
manage
the
looms
of
the
firm
which
he
had
left
in
fact
the
dyeing
and
spinning
for
the
old
firm
formed
a
considerable
part
of
the
business
of
the
new
one
then
came
a
crisis
the
old
firm
took
away
their
work
they
sent
the
wool
to
be
spun
and
the
yarn
to
be
dyed
elsewhere
this
was
a
great
blow
but
eventually
it
was
got
over
by
extra
diligence
energy
and
thrift
crossley
herself
taking
a
full
share
in
the
labours
and
responsibility
of
her
husband
in
addition
to
the
carpet
making
she
says
in
the
manuscript
memoir
of
her
life
we
carried
on
the
manufacture
of
shalloons
and
plainbacks
the
whole
of
which
i
managed
myself
so
far
as
putting
out
the
warps
and
weft
and
taking
in
from
the
weavers
we
had
at
one
time
as
many
as
a
hundred
and
sixty
hand
weavers
on
these
goods
we
sold
the
principal
part
of
them
in
london
we
had
also
about
four
looms
making
brace
webs
and
body
belts
the
produce
of
these
looms
i
sold
principally
to
the
irish
who
made
them
up
into
braces
and
hawked
them
about
the
country
i
also
made
and
stitched
with
assistance
all
the
carpets
that
we
sold
retail
i
used
to
get
up
to
work
by
four
in
the
morning
and
being
very
diligent
i
have
usually
earned
two
shillings
before
breakfast
by
the
time
that
my
neighbours
were
coming
downstairs
the
partnership
of
crossley
travers
and
crossley
lasted
for
twenty
years
when
the
term
had
expired
the
partners
shared
their
savings
they
amounted
to
or
fourteen
hundred
pounds
to
each
this
was
not
a
very
large
sum
to
make
during
twenty
years
hard
work
but
dean
clough
mill
was
then
but
a
small
concern
and
each
partner
did
his
own
share
of
handiwork
in
spinning
dyeing
and
weaving
crossley
says
that
the
fourteen
hundred
pounds
came
in
very
useful
in
fact
it
was
only
a
beginning
john
crossley
eventually
bought
the
dean
clough
mills
out
and
out
he
had
a
family
of
eight
children
to
provide
for
and
he
put
his
sons
for
the
most
part
into
his
business
they
followed
the
example
of
their
parents
and
became
thrifty
useful
and
honourable
men
john
crossley
the
founder
of
the
firm
has
observed
that
in
the
course
of
his
life
he
was
a
keen
observer
of
men
and
things
he
says
he
noticed
many
of
the
failures
of
his
neighbours
in
bringing
up
their
children
some
fathers
were
so
strict
with
their
children
keeping
them
so
constantly
at
home
and
letting
them
see
so
little
of
the
world
in
which
they
lived
that
when
the
fathers
died
and
the
children
were
removed
from
all
restraint
they
came
forth
into
the
world
like
calves
and
found
everything
entirely
different
from
what
they
expected
such
unguided
young
persons
crossley
found
soon
became
wild
lost
and
ruined
then
he
observed
the
opposite
extreme
where
the
fathers
indulged
their
children
so
much
that
they
became
quite
unfitted
to
endure
the
hardships
of
the
world
and
like
a
vessel
that
is
sent
to
sea
without
a
helm
they
soon
became
stranded
on
the
shores
of
life
hence
crossley
endeavoured
to
steer
clear
of
both
extremes
and
to
give
to
his
sons
as
much
knowledge
and
experience
of
life
as
possible
when
at
home
he
always
had
one
of
his
sons
near
him
or
when
he
went
from
home
he
always
took
one
of
them
with
him
thus
they
gained
a
great
deal
of
practical
knowledge
of
life
and
knew
something
of
the
good
and
evil
in
the
world
and
as
they
grew
older
they
were
all
the
better
able
to
turn
their
own
lives
to
the
best
account
it
is
not
necessary
to
follow
the
history
of
the
crossley
family
further
john
crossley
died
in
after
which
the
firm
was
conducted
by
john
joseph
and
sir
francis
crossley
bart
the
latter
represented
the
west
riding
of
the
county
of
york
at
the
time
of
his
death
a
few
years
ago
in
he
purchased
a
splendid
piece
of
ground
which
he
presented
to
the
corporation
of
halifax
to
be
used
as
a
people
park
for
ever
in
the
speech
which
he
made
on
the
occasion
of
presenting
it
he
said
amongst
other
things
that
he
had
often
discussed
with
his
friend
the
mayor
the
philosophy
of
money
i
recollect
very
well
he
said
once
entering
into
the
question
with
him
when
i
was
twenty
years
younger
than
i
am
now
and
saying
that
i
saw
a
great
deal
of
emptiness
about
this
that
many
were
striving
for
that
which
they
thought
would
make
them
happy
but
that
it
was
like
a
bubble
upon
the
water
no
sooner
caught
than
burst
had
i
he
afterwards
said
been
of
noble
birth
or
traced
my
origin
like
some
in
this
room
to
those
who
came
in
with
william
the
conqueror
however
true
it
might
be
it
would
not
have
been
good
it
would
even
be
boastful
to
have
done
so
but
since
i
am
of
humble
birth
perhaps
it
will
be
allowed
me
to
say
a
little
of
those
who
ought
to
share
the
honour
which
is
heaped
upon
me
my
mother
was
the
daughter
of
a
farmer
who
lived
upon
his
own
estate
and
although
it
was
not
large
it
had
been
in
the
family
for
many
generations
her
father
made
the
same
mistake
that
jacob
made
jacob
made
too
much
of
joseph
and
her
father
made
too
much
of
mary
my
mother
was
seventeen
and
quick
in
disposition
she
said
that
right
was
not
done
to
her
at
home

make
her
own

the
consequences
might
be

went
out

contrary
to
the

of

am
honoured

the

did
the

of
kitchenmaid
of
housemaid

of

in
addition
to
that
she
regularly
milked
six
cows
every
night
and
morning
besides
which
she
kept
the
house
which
was
as
clean
as
a
little
palace

this
was
not
enough
to
employ
her
willing
hands
her
mistress
took
in
wool
or
tops
to
spin
and
she
could
do
what
scarcely
any
in
warley
could
have
done
she
spun
that
wool
to
hanks
in
the
pound

thus
earned
many
a
guinea
for
her
mistress

doing
all
her
other

those
who
came

are
not

the

could
they

trace
it
than
any
of
those
who
came
in

william
the

the
latter
are
able
to
trace
their
origin
because
their
numbers
are
so
small
their
possessions
so
large
and
their
introduction
as

comparatively
so
recent
footnote
in
these
snobbish
days
when
rich
people
are
so
often
ashamed
of
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
and
vainly
endeavour
to
make
out
their
ancient
it
was
honest
and
manly
on
the
part
of
sir
francis
crossley
thus
publicly
to
relate
these
facts
and
to
share
with
his
mother
the
honour
of
conferring
his
splendid
present
of
the
park
on
the
townsmen
of
halifax
sir
francis
went
on
to
relate
the
history
of
his
father
as
given
above
from
his
own
manuscript
until
the
time
when
he
took
the
dean
clough
mill
my
mother
he
says
went
thither
with
her
usual
energy
as
she
was
going
down
the
yard
at
four
in
the
morning
she
made
this
vow
the
lord
does
bless
us
at
this
place
the
poor
shall
taste
of
it
it
is
to
this
vow
given
with
so
much
faithfulness
and
kept
with
so
much
fidelity
that
i
attribute
the
great
success
which
my
father
had
in
business
my
mother
was
always
looking
how
she
could
best
keep
this
vow
in
the
days
that
are
gone
by
when
it
was
a
dreary
thing
to
give
employment
to
a
large
number
of
people
the
advice
that
she
gave
to
her
sons
was
not
sell
your
goods
for
less
than
they
cost
for
it
would
ruin
you
without
permanently
benefiting
any
one
but
if
you
can
go
on
giving
employment
during
the
winter
do
so
for
it
is
a
bad
thing
for
a
working
man
to
go
home
and
hear
his
children
cry
for
bread
when
he
has
none
to
give
them
and
now
with
respect
to
the
manner
in
which
sir
francis
crossley
fulfilled
the
vow
of
his
mother
on
the
of
september
he
said
i
left
quebec
early
in
the
morning
for
the
white
mountains
in
the
united
states
i
remember
passing
through
some
of
the
most
glorious
scenery
i
had
ever
seen
on
reaching
the
hotel
at
the
white
mountains
i
went
out
alone
for
an
evening
walk
it
was
a
beautiful
spot
the
sun
was
just
declining
behind
mount
washington
amidst
all
the
glorious
drapery
of
an
american
sunset
i
felt
as
if
i
was
walking
with
god
said
i
i
render
for
all
his
benefits
to
me
lord
what
wilt
thou
have
me
to
do
the
answer
came
immediately
it
was
this
is
true
thou
canst
not
bring
the
many
thousands
thou
has
left
behind
thee
in
thy
native
country
to
see
this
beautiful
scenery
but
thou
canst
take
such
scenery
to
them
it
is
possible
so
to
arrange
art
and
nature
that
they
shall
be
within
the
reach
of
every
working
man
in
halifax
that
he
shall
go
and
take
his
evening
walk
there
after
his
day
toil
has
been
done
well
that
seemed
to
me
a
glorious
thought
i
walked
home
and
my
prayer
that
night
was
that
in
the
morning
i
might
feel
that
my
thought
was
justified
and
that
i
might
be
spared
to
put
it
in
execution
i
slept
soundly
that
night
and
when
i
awoke
my
impression
was
confirmed
on
the
of
september
when
i
left
quebec
for
the
white
mountains
i
had
no
more
idea
of
making
a
park
than
any
one
here
has
of
building
a
city
on
the
day
i
reached
home
i
felt
as
convinced
that
i
should
carry
out
my
thought
as
i
was
of
my
own
existence
and
from
that
day
to
this
i
have
never
flinched
from
the
undertaking
whatever
difficulties
might
arise
it
is
a
happy
day
for
me
that
i
have
been
permitted
to
see
the
result
in
the
people
park
that
has
been
opened
the
park
was
opened
in
august
three
years
later
a
fine
statue
of
sir
francis
crossley
by
joseph
durham
was
placed
in
the
park
so
that
all
comers
while
beholding
the
princely
gift
might
also
see
the
form
and
features
of
the
giver
the
cost
of
the
statue
was
defrayed
by
public
subscription
in
which
persons
of
all
political
parties
joined
the
preparation
of
the

delayed
by
the

the

digging
out
the

they
were
roused
by
shouts
of

a
tribute

gratitude

whose
public

is
situated
in

covers
twelve
acres

one
of
the
most
promising
of
undertakings
established
by
employers
for
the
benefit
of
their
workpeople
was
that
of
the
briggs
and
son
of
whitwood
collieries
near
wakefield
the
collieries
were
converted
into
a
limited
company
in
the
working
colliers
were
made
partners
in
the
prosperity
of
the
concern
to
this
extent
that
whenever
the
divisible
profits
accruing
from
the
business
in
any
year
after
making
allowance
for
depreciation
exceeded
ten
per
cent
on
the
capital
embarked
all
those
employed
by
the
company
were
to
receive
of
such
excess
profit
as
a
bonus
to
be
distributed
amongst
them
in
proportion
to
their
respective
earnings
during
the
year
the
object
of
the
owners
was
to
put
an
end
to
strikes
which
had
sometimes
placed
them
in
peril
of
their
lives
and
also
to
enable
them
to
live
on
better
terms
with
their
workpeople
the
colliers
were
invited
to
become
shareholders
and
thus
to
take
a
personal
interest
in
the
prosperity
of
the
concern
the
project
was
received
with
great
favour
by
the
friends
of

announced
that

had
taken

it
was
highly
honourable

to
have
initiated

after

expressed
his
surprise
at
the
great
success
achieved
in
the
first
year
of
working
the
collieries
as
a
partnership
of
industry
i
believe
he
said
to
the
owners
that
in
taking
this
step
you
have
done
a
great
work
for
england
and
one
which
will
be
gratefully
recognized
before
long
by
the
country
the
promoters
also
claimed
a
reward
from
the
paris
universal
exhibition
for
having
been
the
first
large
employers
in
england
who
have
allowed
all
their
workpeople
whether
with
them
or
not
to
participate
in
all
divisible
profits
beyond
a
fixed
percentage
on
the
capital
of
the
company
only
a
few
years
have
passed
and
already
this
promising
partnership
of
industry
has
come
to
an
end
it
has
not
been
brought
to
an
end
by
the
masters
but
by
the
men
the
masters
were
satisfied
with
the
profits
made
during
the
recent
high
prices
of
coal
but
the
men
were
not
satisfied
with
the
wages
had
they
been
as
free
as
the
welsh
colliers
they
would
have
insisted
on
being
paid
as
highly
but
it
would
have
been
as
it
was
in
wales
ruinous
to
the
masters
the
system
of
industrial
partnership
had
at
length
to
be
abandoned
and
the
men
now
work
for
wages
instead
of
for
the
truth
is
the
colliers
were
not
sufficiently
educated
to
appreciate
the
advantages
of
the
industrial
scheme
though
some
of
the
whitwood
workmen
have
been
stimulated
by
thrift
to
build
and
furnish
houses
of
their
own
the
greater
number
of
them
during
the
recent
flush
of
prosperity
squandered
their
wages
on
frivolity
extravagance
and
intemperance
the
attempt
was
also
made
by
several
firms
engaged
in
the
iron
trade
to
embody
the
principle
of
in
their
respective
concerns
amongst
these
were
the
firms
of
greening
and
manchester
and
fox
head
and
middlesborough
the
experiments
were
to
a
certain
extent
brought
to
an
end
by
the
greed
or
laziness
of
the
colliers
who
have
for
a
time
destroyed
the
prosperity
of
the
iron
trade
greening
and
started
with
great
enthusiasm
and
the
results
were
very
successful
as
regards
the
workpeople
nothing
could
have
been
better
than
the
spirit
of
goodwill
and
even
devotion
which
was
displayed
by
many
of
them
but
unhappily
contracts
were
taken
by
the
management
which
resulted
in
a
series
of
losses
and
the
scheme
ended
in
liquidation
greening
states
that
the
distribution
societies
have
as
yet
been
much
more
successful
than
the
production
societies
but
he
hopes
to
see
the
latter
crown
the
edifice
by
making
workers
everywhere
no
longer
servants
but
with
capital
the
firm
of
fox
head
and
also
admitted
their
workmen
to
a
partnership
of
profits
they
had
for
some
time
been
much
annoyed
by
strikes
their
works
had
stood
idle
for
about
a
fourth
of
the
whole
time
that
had
elapsed
since
their
commencement
the
system
of
was
adopted
in
at
the
close
of
a
long
strike
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
scheme
was
that
fox
head
and
should
not
be
members
of
any
association
of
employers
and
that
the
workmen
should
not
be
members
of
any
trades
union
the
original
intention
was
to
pay
the
workmen
a
bonus
according
to
profits
they
eventually
adopted
the
practice
of
the
briggs
and
which
was
to
divide
the
profits
over
ten
per
cent
into
two
parts
the
one
to
belong
to
the
capitalists
as
their
profit
and
the
other
to
be
divided
amongst
all
those
who
had
received
wages
or
salaries
during
the
year
in
proportion
to
the
amount
received
by
them
an
opportunity
was
also
afforded
to
the
workmen
of
depositing
their
savings
with
the
firm
but
as
there
was
only
one
instance
during
three
years
of
a
workman
applying
to
invest
his
savings
this
clause
was
withdrawn
in
consequence
of
the
depressed
state
of
the
iron
trade
there
were
no
profits
to
be
divided
during
the
first
two
years
the
men
were
however
paid
the
current
rate
of
wages
and
were
saved
the
expenses
of
union
levies
the
store
which
had
been
founded
by
the
workmen
was
in
a
very
prosperous
condition
in
the
third
year
of
the
scheme
a
bonus
of
two
and
a
half
per
cent
was
divided
between
the
employers
and
the
employed
the
workmen
also
received
an
advance
of
five
per
cent
in
wages
in
the
fourth
year
the
wages
of
the
workmen
were
further
increased
ten
per
and
this
took
the
cream
off
the
bowl
however
a
bonus
of
four
per
cent
was
paid
on
the
wages
and
salaries
received
by

that
year

the
meeting

there
may
be
some
who
think
the
tendency
of
our
policy
has
been
too
sentimental
i
do
believe
in
doing
business
on
sentimental
principles
but
i
contend
that
mere
is
not
the
sole
end
of
existence
we
have
been
associated
with
many
of
you
for
several
years
and
we
can
not
help
feeling
a
considerable
interest
in
you
after
all
life
is
not
so
very
long
another
twenty
or
thirty
years
will
see
us
all
under
ground
and
there
will
be
other
employers
and
other
workmen
carrying
on
business
at
newport
rolling
mills
it
would
indeed
be
strange
if
we
did
not
take
some
interest
in
those
with
whom
we
are
so
much
associated
and
so
without
in
the
least
relaxing
discipline
or
sacrificing
any
true
principle
of
business
we
hold
it
to
be
our
duty
as
employers
as
well
as
your
duties
as
to
consider
each
other
interests
and
to
do
all
that
each
of
us
can
in
the
way
of
true
and
hearty
the
coal
famine
began
to
tell
upon
the
the
furnaces
were
often
laid
off
for
want
of
coal
the
principal
causes
of
the
bad
supply
of
coal
arose
from
shorter
hours
of
labour
and
higher
wages
for
less
work
yet
a
bonus
of
three
and

quarter
per

was
allowed

received
by

during
the
year
the
stores
continued
to
be
very
productive
and
many
of
the
members
saved
considerable
sums
of
money
in
the
next
year
a
bonus
of
three
and
a
half
per
cent
was
divided
but
difficulties
were
in
store
the
coal
famine
continued
the
employers
of
labour
held
meetings

you

eventually

deserted
and
lying
hopelessly
and
helplessly
in

last

it
was
of
no
use
the
men
wages
went
up
twenty
per
cent
and
there
was
an
end
of
the
bonuses
the
coal
famine
continued
the
masters
instead
of
making
profits
made
immense
losses
the
price
of
iron
went
down
the
mills
stood
idle
for
two
months
the
result
was
that
when
the
masters
next
met
the
workmen
in
public
meeting
waterhouse
the
auditor
reported
that
while
the
gross
earnings
of
the
year
have
exceeded
the
expenditure
on
materials
wages
and
trade
charges
they
have
been
insufficient
to
cover
the
full
amounts
to
be
provided
under
the
scheme
for
interest
on
capital
depreciation
and
the
reserve
for
bad
debts
and
that
consequently
it
was
his
duty
to
declare
that
no
amount
was
at
present
payable
as
bonus
either
to
employers
or
employed
no
further
report
was
issued
in
excepting
an
announcement
that
there
was
no
dividend
and
that
the

did
not
intend
to
continue
the
scheme
any
longer
during
the
time
that
it
lasted
the
had
received
about
eight
thousand
pounds
in
bonuses
since
then
sir
joseph
whitworth
has
announced
his
intention
of
giving
his
workmen
a
bonus
upon
his
profits
but
the
principle
of
the
division
has
not
yet
been
announced
on
hearing
of
his
intention
carlyle
wrote
the
following
letter
to
sir
joseph
would
to
heaven
that
all
the
captains
of
industry
in
england
had
a
soul
in
them
such
as
yours
the
look
of
england
is
to
me
at
this
moment
abundantly
ominous
the
question
of
capital
and
labour
growing
ever
more
anarchic
insoluble
altogether
by
the
notions
hitherto
applied
to
it
pretty
sure
to
issue
in
petroleum
one
day
unless
some
other
gospel
than
that
of
the
science
come
to
illuminate
it
two
things
are
pretty
sure
to
me
the
first
is
that
capital
and
labour
never
can
or
will
agree
together
till
they
both
first
of
all
decide
on
doing
their
work
faithfully
throughout
and
like
men
of
conscience
and
honour
whose
highest
aim
is
to
behave
like
faithful
citizens
of
this
universe
and
obey
the
eternal
commandments
of
almighty
god
who
made
them
the
second
thing
is
that
a
sadder
object
than
even
that
of
the
coal
strike
or
any
other
conceivable
strike
is
the
fact
that
loosely
speaking
we
may
say
all
england
has
decided
that
the
profitablest
way
is
to
do
its
work
ill
slurily
swiftly
and
mendaciously
what
a
contrast
between
now
and
say
only
a
hundred
years
ago
at
the
latter
date
all
england
awoke
to
its
work
to
an
invocation
to
the
eternal
maker
to
bless
them
in
their
labour
and
help
them
to
do
it
well
now
all
england
shopkeepers
workmen
all
manner
of
competing
labourers
awaken
as
with
an
unspoken
but
heartfelt
prayer
to
beelzebub
help
us
thou
great
lord
of
shoddy
adulteration
and
malfeasance
to
do
our
work
with
the
maximum
of
sluriness
swiftness
profit
and
mendacity
for
the
devil
sake
amen
fortunately
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
this
letter
nor
in
the
heartfelt
prayer
to
shoddy
the
right
hon
forster
ought
to
know
something
of
labour
and
capital
and
at
a
recent
meeting
of
the
cobden
club
he
stated
that
they
were
often
told
that
they
had
a
war
within
their
borders
between
labour
and
capital
but
as
an
employer
of
labour
ever
since
he
came
to
manhood
he
would
only
say
that
he
never
knew
a
time
in
which
employer
and
employed
were
on
better
terms
the
late
sir
francis
crossley
observed
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
unreasonable
feeling
abroad
it
was
held
by
some
that
it
was
wrong
for
working
men
to
sell
their
labour
at
the
best
price
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
their
labour
was
the
only
thing
they
had
to
sell
and
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
leave
those
matters
to
take
their
natural
course
it
was
a
great
mistake
on
the
part
of
employers
to
suppose
that
the
labour
was
always
the
cheapest
if
there
was
not
so
much
desire
to
run
down
the
price
of
labour
and
the
masters
showed
a
more
conciliatory
spirit
there
would
be
fewer
strikes
and
outrages
what
a
contrast
between
now
and
say
only
a
hundred
years
ago
certainly
there
is
a
very
great
contrast
england
was
not
a
manufacturing
country
a
hundred
years
ago
we
imported
nearly
everything
except
corn
wool

look
at

behold
the
condition
of

architecture
a
hundred
years

we
had
fallen
to
almost
the
lowest
condition
as
a
nation
we
had
not
a
harbour
we
had
not
a

the
most
extensive
system
of

such
as
they
were
swarmed

by
the
highlanders
upon
the

down
to
the
middle
of

century
a
hundred

ago
our
ships
were
rotten

were
manned

prisoners
taken
from

by

when
james
watt
was
learning
his
trade

an
instrument
maker
in
london
a
hundred
years

he
durst
scarcely
walk
abroad

he
should

the
american
plantations
less

colliers

salters
of
scotland
were
slaves
it

not
forty
years
since
women

worked
in

surely
we
are
not
to
go
down
upon
our
knees
and
pray
for
a
restoration
of
the
horrible
things
that
existed
a
hundred
years
ago
a
hundred
years

ireland
was
treated
like
a
conquered
country

and
the

was
put
down
by
bloodshed

ever

that
their
discourse
is
entirely
free
from

drunkenness
was
considered
a
manly
vice
to
drink
deep
was
the
fashion
of
the
day
men
were
common
even
drunken
clergymen
were
not

what
were

amusements
of
the
people
a
hundred
years
ago
they
consisted
principally
of
bull
baiting
the
pillory
public
whipping
and
public
executions
wyndham
vindicated
the
ruffianism
of
the
ring
in
his
place
in
parliament
and
held
it
up
as
a
school
in
which
englishmen
learnt
pluck
and
the
manly
art
of
was
perhaps
more
brutal
than
though
wyndham
defended
it
as
calculated
to
stimulate
the
noble
courage
of
englishmen
the
bull
was
secured
to

stake

can
scarcely
imagine
the
savageness
of
the
sport
the
animal
mutilations
the
imprecations
of

worse
than

the
ferociousness

the
pillory

one
of
our
institutions
fifty
years
ago
and
men
and
women
used
to
be
placed
there
for
offences
such
as
a
wise
legislature
would
have
endeavoured
to
conceal
from
public
consideration
the
horrid
scenes
which
then
took
place
when
men
women
and
children
collected
in
crowds
to
pelt
the
offenders
with
missiles
were
so
disgusting
that
they
can
not
be
described
not
more
seemly
were
the
public
whippings
then
administered
to
women
in
common
with
the
coarsest
male
offenders
the
public
abominations
and
obscenities
of
the
good
old
times
would
almost
have
disgraced
the
days
of
nero
but
and
other
ferocious
amusements
have
now
departed
even
the
village
stocks
have
rotted
out
drunkenness
has
become
disreputable
the
good
old
times
have
departed
we
hope
never
to
return
the
labourer
has
now
other
resources
beside
the
there
are
exhibitions
and
people
parks
steamboats
and
railways
and
museums
gardens
and
cheap
concerts
in
place
of
the
disgusting
old
amusements
there
has
come
a
healthier
sounder
life
greater
enlightenment
more
general
sobriety
and
a
humaner
spirit
we
have
in
a
hundred
years
outgrown
many
of
our
savage
tendencies
we
are
not
less
brave
as
a
people
though
less
brutal
we
are
quite
as
manly
though
much
less
gross
manners
are
more
refined
yet
as
a
people
we
have
not
lost
our
pluck
energy
and
endurance
we
respect
ourselves
more
and
as
a
nation
we
have
become
more
respected
we
now
think
with
shame
of
the
manners
of
a
hundred
years
ago
the
achievements
of
which
england
has
most
reason
to
be
proud
have
been
accomplished
during
the
last
hundred
years
english
slaves
have
been
emancipated
both
at
home
and
abroad
impressment
has
been
done
away
with
parliamentary
representation
has
been
conferred
upon
all
classes
of
the
people
the
corn
laws
have
been
abolished
free
trade
has
been
established
our
ports
are
now
open
to
the
whole
world
and
then
see
what
our
inventors
have
accomplished
james
watt
invented
the
which
in
a
few
years
created
a
large
number
of
new
industries
and
gave
employment
to
immense
numbers
of
people
henry
cort
invented
the
and
enabled
england
to
rely
upon
its
own
stores
of
iron
instead
of
depending
upon
foreign
and
perhaps
hostile
countries
all
the
docks
and
harbours
round
the
english
coast
have
been
formed
during
the
present
century
the
steamboat
the
railway
and
the
telegraph
have
only
been
invented
and
applied
during
the
last
fifty
years
with
respect
to
the
charge
made
against
the
english
workman
as
to
the
sluriness
swiftness
and
mendacity
of
his
work
it
is
simply
impossible
that
this
should
be
so
our
ports
are
free
and
open
to
the
world
and
if
frenchmen
germans
belgians
or
americans
could
execute
better
work
than
englishmen
we
should
not
only
cease
to
export
but
also
lose
our
home
trade
the
foreigner
is
now
free
to
undersell
us
if
he
can
in
our
own
markets
it
was
in
the
perfect
confidence
that
englishmen
were
the
best
and
most
honest
workers
in
the
world
that
free
trade
was
established
should
we
ever
become
a
shoddy
manufacturing
people
free
trade
will
probably
be
abolished
and
we
shall
then
impose
prohibitory
duties
upon
foreign
manufactures
but
is
it
not
the
fact
that
every
year
sees
an
increase
in
the
exports
of
english
goods
that
english
workmanship
is
not
considered
the
worst
but
the
best
in
the
general
markets
of
the
world
and
that
numerous
foreign
makers
place
an
english
mark
upon
their
productions
in
order
to
ensure
their
sale
it
is
by
means
of
english
workmen
and
english
tools
and
machines
that
continental
manufactories
themselves
have
been
established
and
yet
notwithstanding
their
cheaper
labour
we
should
command
the
foreign
market
but
for
the
prohibitory
duties
which
foreigners
impose
upon
english
manufactures
brassey
in
his
book
on
and
says
it
may
be
affirmed
that
as
practical
mechanics
the
english
are
unsurpassed
the
presence
of
the
english
engineer
the
solitary
representative
among
a
crew
of
foreigners
of
the
mechanical
genius
of
his
country
is
a
familiar
recollection
to
all
who
have
travelled
much
in
the
steamers
of
the
mediterranean
consul
lever
says
that
in
the
vast
establishment
of
the
austrian
lloyds
at
trieste
a
number
of
english
mechanical
engineers
are
employed
not
only
in
the
workshops
but
as
navigating
engineers
in
the
company
fleet
although
there
is
no
difficulty
in
substituting
for
these
men
germans
or
swiss
at
lower
rates
of
payment
the
uniform
accuracy
of
the
english
their
intelligence
their
consummate
mastery
of
all
the
details
of
their
art
and
their
resources
in
every
case
of
difficulty
have
entirely
established
their
superiority

brassey
says
that
during
the
construction
of
the
paris
and
rouen
railway
the
frenchman
irishman
and
englishman
were
employed
side
by
side
in
the
same
quarry
at
bounierés
the
frenchman
received
three
francs
the
irishman
four
and
the
englishman
six
and
the
last
was
found
to
be
the
most
advantageous
workman
of
the
three
the
superiority
of
the
english
workman
over
persons
of
other
nations
was
equally
remarkable
whenever
there
was
an
opportunity
of
employing
him
side
by
side
with
them
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
swiftness
of
english
workmanship
but
this
is
one
of
the
merits
of
english
mechanism
jules
simon
observes
that
heretofore
the
manual
labourer
has
been
an
intelligent
force
but
by
means
of
machinery
he
is
converted
into
an
intelligent
director
of
force
it
is
by
the
speed
of
the
english
machinery
and
the
intelligent
quickness
of
the
workmen
that
his
master
makes
a
profit
and
himself
such
high
wages
as
compared
with
continental
workmen

employed

it
is
by

of
the
swiftness
of
our
machinery
that
we
are

an
annual
report
is
furnished
to
the
government
by
our
foreign
consuls
with
reference
to
the
character
and
condition
of
the
working
classes
in
most
parts
of
the
civilized
world
walter
in
a
recent
address
to
an
assembly
of
workmen
referred
to
one
of
these
reports
he
said
there
is
one
remark
in
particular
that
occurs
with
lamentable
frequency
throughout
the
report
that
with
few
exceptions
the
foreign
workman
does
not
appear
take
pride
in
his
work
nor
to
use
a
significant
expression
to
his
character
into
it
a
remarkable
instance
of
this
is
mentioned
of
a
country
which
generally
constitutes
an
honourable
exception
to
this
unhappy
rule
switzerland
is
a
country
famous
for
its
education
and
its
watches
yet
the
following
passage
from
the
report
will
show
that
neither
knowledge
nor
skill
will
suffice
without
the
exercise
of
that
higher
quality
on
which
i
have
been
dwelling
a
rule
it
says
workmen
are
competent
in
their
several
trades
and
take
an
interest
in
their
work
for
thanks
to
their
superior
education
they
fully
appreciate
the
pecuniary
advantages
to
their
masters
and
indirectly
to
themselves
of
adhering
strictly
to
this
course
a
striking
instance
of
the
impolicy
of
acting
otherwise
has
lately
happened
at
imier
in
the
bernese
jura
and
produced
a
deep
impression
in
this
district
for
some
years
past
a
great
falling
off
in
the
quality
of
the
watches
manufactured
has
taken
place
owing
to
the
inhabitants
finding
it
much
more
profitable
to
increase
the
production
at
the
cost
of
the
workmanship
than
to
abide
by
the
old
rules
of
the
trade
they
prospered
beyond
all
expectation
for
a
considerable
time
but
finally
their
watches
got
such
a
bad
name
that
they
became
unsaleable
and
the
result
is
a
general
bankruptcy
of
nearly
all
the
watchmakers
of
this
particular
district
one
thing
however
remains
to
be
said
of
foreign
workmen
generally
although
they
do
not
work
so
hard
as
the
english
they
take
much
better
care
of
their
earnings
they
are
exceedingly
frugal
and
economical
frenchmen
are
much
soberer
than
englishmen
and
much
better
mannered
they
are
on
the
whole
greatly
more
provident
than
english
workmen
brassey
states
that
when
the
paris
and
rouen
railway
works
were
commenced
the
contractors
endeavoured
to
introduce
a
system
by
which
the
workmen
were
to
be
paid
once
a
fortnight
but
very
soon
after
the
operations
had
begun
the
frenchmen
requested
that
the
pay
might
take
place
only
once
a
month
reid
managing
director
of
the
line
told
the
house
of
commons
committee
on
railway
labourers
that
a
french
labourer
is
a
much
more
independent
person
than
an
englishman
and
much
more
respectable
he
stated
in
support
of
his
opinion
this
remarkable
circumstance
that
whereas
a
french
labourer
desired
to
be
paid
only
once
a
month
the
english
labourer
desired
to
be
paid
every
saturday
night
and
by
the
following
wednesday
he
wanted
something
on
account
of
the
week
work
nothing
could
be
a
greater
test
said
reid
of
the
respectability
of
a
working
man
than
being
able
to
go
without
his
pay
for
a
month

to
be

to
run
into

for

it
enough
to
break
the
heart
of
an
angel
extravagance
is
the
pervading
sin
of
modern
society
it
is
not
confined
to
the
rich
and
moneyed
classes
but
extends
also
to
the
middle
and
working
classes
there
never
was
such
a
burning
desire
to
be
rich
or
to
to
be
rich
people
are
no
longer
satisfied
with
the
earnings
of
honest
industry
but
they
must
aim
at
becoming
suddenly
rich
by
speculation

swindling
or

general
extravagance
is
to
be
seen
everywhere
it
is
especially
the
characteristic
of
town
life
you
see
it
in
the
streets
in
the
parks
in
the
churches
the
extravagance
of
dress
is
only
one
of
its
signs
there
is
a
general
prodigality
in
social
display
people
live
in
a
style
beyond
their
means
and
the
results
are
observed
in
commercial
failures
in
lists
of
bankrupts
and
in
criminal
courts
where
business
men
are
so
often
convicted
of
dishonesty
and
fraud
appearances
must
be
kept
up
men
must
to

hypocrites
can
easily
impose
upon
those
who
are

people
must
now
live
in
a
certain
style
inhabit
handsome
houses
give
good
dinners
drink
fine

and
have
a
handsome
equipage
perhaps
they
are
only
able
to
accomplish
this
by
overreaching
or
by
dishonesty
everybody
wondered
at
the
generosity
and
style
of
redpath
and
robson
but
there
are
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
redpaths
and
robsons
now
there
is
another
class
of
people
not
fraudulent
but
extravagant
though
perhaps
on
the
brink
of
becoming
fraudulent
they
live
up
to
their
means
and
often
beyond
them
they
desire
to
be
considered
respectable
people
they
live
according
to
the
pernicious
adage
one
must
do
as
others
do
they
do
not
consider
whether
they
can
afford
to
live
up
to
or
beyond
their
means
but
they
think
it
necessary
to
secure
the
respect
of
others
in
doing
so
they
usually
sacrifice
their
own
they
regard
their
dress
their
establishments
their
manner
of
living
and
their
observance
of
fashion
as
the
sole
tests
of
respectability
and
rank
they
make
an
appearance
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
though
it
may
be
entirely
hypocritical
and
false
but
they
must
not
poor
they
must
hide
their
poverty
by
every
effort
they
spend
their
money
before
it
is
earned
run
into
debt
at
the
grocer
the
baker
the
milliner
and
the
butcher
they
must
entertain
their
fashionable
friends
at
the
expense
of
the
shopkeepers
and
yet
when
misfortunes
overtake
them
and
when
their
debts
have
become
overwhelming
what
becomes
of
the
friends
they
fly
away
and
shun
the
man
who
is
up
to
his
ears
in
debt
yet
poverty
is
more
than
half
disarmed
by
those
who
have
the
moral
courage
to
say
i
ca
afford
it
friends
are
of
no
use
whatever
except
as
an
indication
of
the
depth
of
snobbery
to
which
human
beings
can
descend
what
is
a
visiting
connection
it
is
not
at
all
calculated
to
elevate
one
in
social
or
even
in
business
life
success
mainly
depends
upon
character
and
the
general
esteem
in
which
a
person
is
held
and
if
the
attempt
is
made
to
snatch
the
reward
of
success
before
it
is
earned
the
footing
may
at
once
give
way
and
the
aspirant
will
fall
unlamented
into
the
dragon

grundy

are
all

she
may
be
a
very
vulgar
and
commonplace
person
but
her
power
is
nevertheless
prodigious
we
copy
and
imitate
her
in
all
things
we
are
pinned
to
her
we
are
obedient
at
her
bidding
we
are
indolent
and
complaisant
and
fear
to
provoke
her
what
will
grundy
say
quells
many
a
noble
impulse
hinders
many
a
act
there
seems
to
be
a
general
though
unconscious
conspiracy
existing
against
each
other
individuality
and
manhood
we
discourage
and
demand
conformity
each
must
see
with
others
eyes
and
think
through
others
minds
we
are
idolaters
of
customs
and
observances
looking
behind
not
forwards
and
upwards
pinned
down
and
held
back
by
ignorance
and
weakness
we
are
afraid
of
standing
alone
or
of
thinking
and
acting
for
ourselves
conventionalism
rules
all
we
fear
stepping
out
into
the
free
air
of
independent
thought
and
action
we
refuse
to
plant
ourselves
upon
our
instincts
and
to
vindicate
our
spiritual
freedom
we
are
content
to
bear
others
fruit
not
our
own
in
private
affairs
the
same
spirit
is
alike
deleterious
we
live
as
society
directs
each
according
to
the
standard
of
our
class
we
have
a
superstitious
reverence
for
custom
we
dress
and
eat
and
live
in
conformity
with
the
grundy
law
so
long
as
we
do
this
we
are
respectable
according
to
class
notions
thus
many
rush
upon
misery
for
no
better
excuse
than
a
foolish
fear
of
the
world
they
are
afraid
of
what
others
will
say
of
them
and
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
those
who
might
probably
raise
the
voice
of
censure
are
not
the
wise
or
the
but
much
oftener
the
foolish
the
vain
and
the
sir
william
temple
has
said
that
a
restlessness
in
men
minds
to
be
something
that
they
are
not
and
to
have
something
that
they
have
not
is
the
root
of
all
immorality
the
statement
is
strictly
correct
it
has
been
attested
by
universal
experience
keeping
up
appearances
is
one
of
the
greatest
social
evils
of
the
age
there
is
a
general
effort
more
particularly
amongst
the
middle
and
upper
classes
at
seeming
to
be
something
that
they
are
not
they
put
on
appearances
live
a
life
of
sham
and
endeavour
to
look
something
superior
to
what
they
really
are
respectability
is
one
of
the
chief
aims
respectability
regarded
in
its
true
sense
is
a
desirable
thing
to
be
respected
on
right
grounds
is
an
object
which
every
man
and
woman
is
justified
in
obtaining
but
modern
respectability
consists
of
external
appearances
it
means
wearing
fine
clothes
dwelling
in
fine
houses
and
living
in
fine
style
it
looks
to
the
outside
to
sound
show
externals
it
listens
to
the
chink
of
gold
in
the
pocket
moral
worth
or
goodness
forms
no
part
of
modern
respectability
a
man
in
these
days
may
be
perfectly
respectable
and
yet
altogether
despicable
this
false
and
demoralizing
habit
arises
from
the
overweening
estimate
which
is
formed
of
two
things
well
enough
in
their
place
rank
and
wealth
everybody
struggles
to
rise
into
some
superior
class
the
spirit
of
caste
is
found
as
keenly
at
work
among
the
humblest
as
among
the
highest
ranks
at
birmingham
there
was
a
club
of
workmen
with
tails
to
their
coats
and
another
without
tails
the
one
looked
down
upon
the
other
cobbett
so
felicitous
in
his
nicknames
called
his
political
opponent
sadler
a
linendraper
but
the
linendraper
also
has
plenty
of
people
beneath
him
the
linendraper
looks
down
on
the
huckster
the
huckster
on
the
mechanic
and
the

on

labourer
the
flunkey
who
exhibits
his
calves
behind
a
baron
holds
his
head
considerably
higher
than
the
flunkey
who
serves
a
brewer
it
matters
not
at
what
class
you
begin
or
however
low
in
the
social
scale
you
will
find
that
every
man
has
somebody
beneath
him
among
the
middling
ranks
this
sort
of
exclusiveness
is
very
marked
each
circle
would
think
it
a
degradation
to
mix
on
familiar
terms
with
the
members
of
the
circle
beneath
it
in
small
towns
and
villages
you
will
find
distinct
coteries
holding
aloof
from
each
other
perhaps
despising
each
other
and
very
often
pelting
each
other
with
hard
words
the
cathedral
towns
generally
have
at
least
six
of
such
distinct
classes
ranking
one
beneath
the
other
and
while
each
has
his
or
her
own
exclusive
circle
which
all
of
supposed
inferior
rank
are
precluded
from
entering
they
are
at
the
same
time
struggling
to
pass
over
the
line
of
social
demarcation
which
has
been
drawn
by
those
above
them
they
are
eager
to
overleap
it
and
thus
gain
admission
into
a
circle
still
more
exclusive
than
their
own
there
is
also
a
desperate
scramble
for
front
places
and
many
are
the
mean
shifts
employed
to
gain
them
we
must
possess
the
homage
of
society
and
for
this
purpose
we
must
be
rich
or
at
least
to
be
so
hence
the
struggles
after
style
the
efforts
made
to
put
on
the
appearances
of
wealth
the
dash
the
glitter
and
the
show
of
middle
and
upper
class
life
and
hence
too
the
motley
train
of
palled
and
vitiated
tastes
of
shrunken
hearts
and
stunted
intellects
of
folly
frivolity
and
madness
one
of
the
most
demoralizing
practices
of
modern
refinement
is
the
large
party
system
people
cram
their
houses
with
respectable
mobs
thus
conforming
to
a
ridiculous
custom
rousseau
with
all
his
aberrations
of

said
i
had
rather
have
my
house
too
small
for
a
day
than
too
large
for
a
twelvemonth
fashion
exactly
reverses
the
maxim
and
domestic
mischief
is
often
begun
with
a
large
dwelling
and
suitable
accommodations
the
misfortune
consists
in
this
that
we
never
look
below
our
level
for
an
example
but
always
above
it
it
is
not
so
much
however
in
the
mere
appearances
kept
up
as
in
the
means
taken
to
keep
them
up
that
the
fruitful
cause
of
immorality
is
to
be
found
a
man
having
assumed
a
class
status
runs
all
risks
to
keep
it
up
it
is
thought
to
be
a
descent
in
the
world
to
abridge
oneself
of
a
superfluity
the
man
who
drives
his
close
carriage
and
drinks
champagne
will
not
tolerate
a
descent
to
a
gig
and
plain
beer
and
the
respectable
man
who
keeps
his
gig
would
think
it
a
degradation
to
have
to
travel
afoot
or
in
a
between
his
country
house
and
his
town
office
they
will
descend
to
immorality
rather
than
descend
in
apparent
rank
they
will
yield
to
dishonesty
rather
than
yield
up
the
mock
applause
and
hollow
respect
of
that
big
fool
the
world
everybody
can
call
to
mind
hundreds
of
cases
of
men
respectable
men
who
from
one
extravagance
have
gone
on
to
another
wantonly
squandering
wealth
which
was
not
theirs
in
order
to
keep
up
a
worldly
reputation
and
cut
a
figure
before
their
admiring
fellows
all
ending
in
a
sudden
smash
a
frightful
downfall
an
utter

to

least
obtain
the
world
good
opinion
how
often
is
suicide
traceable
to
this
false
sentiment
vain
men
will
give
up
their
lives
rather
than
their
class
notions
of
respectability
they
will
cut
the
thread
of
existence
rather
than
cut
fashionable
life
very
few
suicides
are
committed
from
real
want
we
never
hear
says
joel
barlow
of
a
man
committing
suicide
for
want
of
a
loaf
of
bread
but
it
is
often
done
for
want
of
a
coach
of
this
mean
and
miserable
spirit
of
class
and
caste
women
are
the
especial
victims
they
are
generally
brought
up
with
false
notions
of
life
and
are
taught
to
estimate
men
and
things
rather
by
their
external
appearances
than
by
their
intrinsic
worth
their
education
is
conducted
mainly
with
the
view
of
pleasing
and
attracting
the
admiration
of
others
rather
than
of
improving
and
developing
their
qualities
of
mind
and
heart
they
are
imbued
with
notions
of
exclusiveness
fashion
and
gentility
a
respectable
position
in
society
is
held
up
to
them
as
the
mark
to
be
aimed
at
to
be
criminal
or
vicious
is
virtually
represented
to
them
as
far
less
horrible
than
to
be
vulgar
immured
within
the
bastile
of
exclusivism
woman
is
held
captive
to
all
the
paltry
shifts
and
expediencies
of
convention
fashion
gentility
and
so
forth
the
genuine
benevolence
of
her
nature
is
perverted
her
heart
becomes
contracted
and
the
very
highest
sources
of
happiness
those
which
consist
in
a
kindly
sympathy
with
humanity
in
all
ranks
of
life
are
as
a
well
shut
up
and
a
fountain
sealed
is
it
not
a
fact
that
in
what
is
called
fashionable
society
a
fine
outside
appearance
is
regarded
almost
in
the
light
of
a
virtue
that
to
be
rich
or
to
have
the
appearance
of
riches
is
esteemed
as
a
merit
of
a
high
order
whereas
to
be
poor
or
to
seem
so
ranks
as
something
like
an
unpardonable
offence
nay
such
is
the
heartlessness
of
this
class
spirit
that
a
young
woman
belonging
to
the
better
class
who
by
misfortune
or
family
reverses
has
been
thrown
upon
her
own
resources
and
who
endeavours
by
her
own
honest
hands
to
earn
her
honest
bread
immediately
loses
caste
and
is
virtually
expelled
from
respectable
society
the
resolution
to
be
independent
the
most
invigorating
resolution
which
can
take
possession
of
the
human
mind
is
scouted
in
such
circles
as
a
degrading
thing
and
those
who
have
been
brought
up
within
the
influence
of
fashion
will
submit
to
the
most
severe
privations
rather
than
submit
to
the
loss
of
their
class
and
caste
respectability
thus
brought
up
it
is
no
wonder
that
woman
has
been
the
with
man
in
upholding
the
general
extravagance
of
the
age
there
never
was
such
a
rage
for
dress
and
finery
amongst
english
women
as
there
is
now
it
rivals
the
corrupt
and
debauched
age
of
louis
xv
of
france
a
delirium
of
fashion
exists
women
are
ranked
by
what
they
wear
not
by
what
they
are
extravagance
of
dress
and
almost
indecency
of
dress
has
taken
the
place
of
simple
womanly
beauty
wordsworth
once
described
the
perfect
woman
nobly
planned
where
will
you
find
the
perfect
woman
now
not
in
the
creature
the
thing
of
shreds
and
patches
with
false
hair
false
colour
false
eyebrows
false
everything
some
of
nature
journeymen
have
made
them
and
not
made
them
well
they
imitate
humanity
so
abominably
the
evil
does
not
stop
with
the
moneyed
classes
it
descends
to
those
who
have
nothing
but
their
salary
to
live
upon
it
descends
to
the
wives
of
clerks
and
shopmen
they
too
dress
for
respectability
they
live
beyond
their
means
they
must
live
in
gimcrack
suburban
villas
and
give
parties
they
must
see
what
is
going
on
at
the
theatres
every
farthing
is
spent
so
soon
as
earned
sometimes
before
the
husband
does
not
insure
his
life
and
the
wife
runs
into
debt
if
the
man
died
he
would
leave
his
wife
and
children
paupers
the
money
he
ought
to
have
saved
during
his
life
of
toil
is
spent
on
respectability
and
if
he
leaves
a
few
pounds
behind
him
they
are
usually
spent
in
giving
the
thriftless
husband
a
respectable
funeral
is
that
dress
paid
for
asked
a
husband
no
then
you
are
allowing
yourself
to
be
clothed
at
another
man
expense
no
woman
is
justified
in
running
into
debt
for
a
dress
without
her
husband
knowledge
and
consent
if
she
do
so
she
is
clothing
herself
at
the
expense
of
the
draper
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
worry
a
man
who
is
trying
to
keep
his
head
above
water
and
it
is
often
sufficient
to
turn
his
heart
against
his
wife
and
her
extravagances
it
is
in
this
way
that
incomes
are
muddled
away
and
that
life
is
rendered
the
scene
of
bitterness
and
discontent
this
is
especially
the
case
when
both
husband
and
wife
are
alike
spendthrifts
by
running
into

yourself
or
by
your
allowing
your

to

into

you

for
superfluities

the

one
might
almost
regard
modern
shopkeepers
in
the
same
light
by
giving
credit
by
pressing
women
to
buy
fine
clothes
they
place
the
strongest
temptation
before
them
they
inveigle
the

who
are
disposed

send
in

they

heavier

pay
them

debts

effect
would
be
that
no
one
would
be
able
to
ask
credit
at
a
shop
except
where
he
was
well
known

for
trifling
sums
all
prices
would
sink

who
always
pay
too
late

experience
of
the
manner
in
which
young
men
have
been
led
from
the
way
of
into
that
of
vice
and
criminality
on
one
occasion
his
name
was
forged
by
a
clerk
to
enable
him
to
obtain
a
sum
of
money
to
pay
the
debts
incurred
by
him
at
a
the
criminal
was
originally
a
young
man
of
good
education
of
reasonable
ability
and
married
to
a
respectable
young
lady
but
all
his
relatives
and
friends
were
forgotten
wife
and
child
and
all
in
his
love
for
drink
and
he
was
condemned
and
sentenced
to
several
imprisonment
in
another
case
the
defaulter
was
the
son
of
a
dissenting
minister
he
stole
some
valuable
documents
which
he
converted
into
money
he
escaped
and
was
tracked
he
had
given
out
that
he
was
going
to
australia
by
southampton
the
peninsular
and
oriental
steamer
was
searched
but
no
person
answering
to
his
description
was
discovered
some
time
passed
when
one
of
the
bank
of
england
notes
which
he
had
carried
away
with
him
was
returned
to
the
bank
from
dublin
a
detective
was
put
upon
his
track
he
was
found
in
the
lowest
company
brought
back
to
london
tried
and
sentenced
to
twelve
months
imprisonment
in
another
case
the
criminal
occupied
a
high
position
in
a
railway
company
so
high
that
he
was
promoted
from
it
to
be
manager
of
the
royal
swedish
railway
he
was
one
of
the
too
numerous
persons
who
are
engaged
in
keeping
up
appearances
irrespective
of
honesty
morality
or
virtue
he
got
deeply
into
debt
as
most
of
such
people
do
and
then
he
became
dishonest
he
became
the
associate
of
professional
thieves
he
abstracted
a
key
from
the
office
of
which
he
was
in
charge
and
handed
it
to
a
thief
this
was
the
key
of
the
strong
box
in
which
gold
and
silver
were
conveyed
by
railway
from
london
to
paris
a
cast
of
the
key
was
taken
in
wax
and
it
was
copied
in
iron
it
was
by
means
of
this
key
that
the
great
gold
robbery
was
effected
after
some
time
the
thieves
were
apprehended
and
the
person
who
had
stolen
the
key
the

appearances

of

was
apprehended

and

the
rev
john
davis
the
late
chaplain
of
newgate
published
the
following
among
other
accounts
of
the
causes
of
crime
among
the
convicted
young
men
who
came
under
his
notice
i
knew
a
youth
the
child
of
an
officer
in
the
navy
who
had
served
his
country
with
distinction
but
whose
premature
death
rendered
his
widow
thankful
to
receive
an
official
appointment
for
her
delicate
boy
in
a
government
office
his
income
from
the
office
was
given
faithfully
to
his
mother
and
it
was
a
pleasure
and
a
pride
to
him
to
gladden
her
heart
by
the
thought
that
he
was
helping
her
she
had
other
children
two
little
girls
just
rising
from
the
cradle
to
womanhood
her
scanty
pension
and
his
salary
made
every
one
happy
but
over
this
youth
came
a
love
of
dress
he
had
not
strength
of
mind
to
see
how
much
more
truly
beautiful
a
pure
mind
is
than
a
finely
decorated
exterior
he
took
pleasure
in
helping
his
mother
and
sisters
but
did
not
take
greater
pleasure
in
thinking
that
to
do
this
kindness
to
them
he
must
be
contented
for
a
time
to
dress
a
little
worse
than
his
his
clothes
might
appear
a
little
worn
but
they
were
like
the
spot
on
the
dress
of
a
soldier
arising
from
the
discharge
of
duty
they
were
no
marks
of
undue
carelessness
necessity
had
wrought
them
and
while
they
indicated
necessity
they
marked
also
the
path
of
honour
and
without
such
spots
duty
must
have
been
neglected
but
this
youth
did
not
think
of
such
great
thoughts
as
these
he
felt
ashamed
at
his
threadbare
but
clean
coat
the
smart
dress
of
other
clerks
mortified
him
he
wanted
to
appear
finer
in
an
evil
hour
he
ordered
a
suit
of
clothes
from
a
fashionable
tailor
his
situation
and
connections
procured
him
a
short
credit
but
tradesmen
must
be
paid
and
he
was
again
and
again
importuned
to
defray
his
debt
to
relieve
himself
of
his
creditor
he
stole
a
letter
containing
a
note
his
tailor
was
paid
but
the
injured
party
knew
the
number
of
the
note
it
was
traced
to
the
tailor
by
him
to
the
thief
with
the
means
and
opportunity
of
stealing
it
and
in
a
few
days
he
was
transported
his
handsome
dress
was
exchanged
for
the
dress
of
a
convict
better
by
far
would
it
have
been
for
him
to
have
worn
his
poorer
garb
with
the
marks
of
honest
labour
upon
it
he
formed
only
another
example
of
the
intense
folly
of
love
of
dress
which
exists
quite
as
much
amongst
foolish
young
men
as
amongst
foolish
young
women
when
sir
charles
napier
left
india
he
issued
an
order
to
the
army
in
which
he
reproved
the
officers
for
contracting
debts
without
the
prospect
of
paying
them
the
found
that
he
was
subject
to
constant
complaints
against
officers
for
of
debts
and
in
some
cases
he
found
that
the
ruin
of
deserving
and
industrious
tradesmen
had
been
consequent
on
that
cause
this
growing
vice
he
severely
reprimanded
as
being
derogatory
to
the
character
of
the
gentleman
as
a
degrading
thing
as
entitling
those
who
practised
it
to
group
with
the
infamous
with
those
who
are
cheats
and
whose
society
is
contamination
he
strongly
urged
them
to
stick
to
their
duties
to
reprobate
extravagance
and
expense
of
all
sorts
and
to
practise
rigid
economy
for
to
drink
champagne
and
beer
and
to
ride
horses
is
to
be
a
cheat
and
not
a
gentleman
the
extravagance
of
these
young
gentlemen
in
india
is
in
too
many
respects
but
a
counterpart
of
the
extravagance
of
our
young
gentlemen
at
home
the
revelations
of
extravagances
at
oxford
and
cambridge
point
to
the
school
in
which
they
have
learnt
their
manners
many
worthy
parents
have
been
ruined
by
the
sons
whom
they
had
sent
thither
to
be
made
scholars
of
but
who
have
learnt
only
to
be
gentlemen
in
the
popular
acceptation
of
the
word
to
be
a
gentleman
nowadays
is
to
be
a
gambler
a
a
a
dancer
a
hunter
a
or
all
combined
the
gentleman
lives
fast
spends
fast
drinks
fast
dies
fast
the
old
style
of
gentleman
has
degenerated
into
a
gent
and
a
fast
man
gentleman
has
become
disreputable
and
when
it
is
now
employed
it
oftener
signifies
an
idle
spendthrift
than
an
accomplished
virtuous
laborious
man
young
men
are
growing
quite
shameless
about
being
in
debt
and
the
immorality
extends
throughout
society
tastes
are
becoming
more
extravagant
and
luxurious
without
the
corresponding
increase
of
means
to
enable
them
to
be
gratified
but
they
are
gratified
nevertheless
and
debts
are
incurred
which
afterwards
weigh
like
a
millstone
round
the
neck
extravagant
habits
once
formed
and
fostered
are
very
difficult
to
give
up
the
existing
recklessness
of
running
into
debt
without
the
prospect
often
without
even
the
intention
of
paying
the
debt
saps
the
public
morals
and
spreads
misery
throughout
the
middle
and
upper
classes
of
society
the
tone
of
morality
has
sunk
and
it
will
be
long
before
it
is
fairly
recovered
again
in
the
mean
time
those
who
can
ought
to
set
their
faces
against
all
expenditure
where
there
are
not
sufficient
means
to
justify
it
the
safest
plan
is
to
run
up
no
bills
and
never
to
get
into
debt
and
the
next
is
if
one
does
get
into
debt
to
get
out
of
it
again
as
quickly
as
possible
a
man
in
debt
is
not
his
own
master
he
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
tradesmen
he
employs
he
is
the
butt
of
lawyers
the
byword
of
creditors
the
scandal
of
neighbours
he
is
a
slave
in
his
own
house
his
moral
character
becomes
degraded
and
defiled
and
even
his
own
household
and
family
regard
him
with

johnson
might

the

of

no
man
can
be
free
who
is
in
debt
the
inevitable
effect
of
debt
is
not
only
to
injure
personal
independence
but
in
the
long
run
to
inflict
moral
degradation
the
debtor
is
exposed
to
constant
humiliations
men
of
honourable
principles
must
be
disgusted
by
borrowing
money
from
persons
to
whom
they

not

the
earl
of
dorset
like
many
other
young
nobles
became
involved
in
debt
and
borrowed
money
upon
his
property
he
was
cured
of
his
prodigality
by
the
impertinence
of
a
city
alderman
who
haunted
his
antechamber
for
the
purpose
of
dunning
him
for
his
debt
from
that
day
the
earl
determined
to
economize
to
keep
entirely
out
of
everybody
debt
and
he
kept
his
word
let
every
man
have
the
fortitude
to
look
his
affairs
in
the
face
to
keep
an
account
of
his
items
of
income
and
debts
no
matter
how
long
or
black
the
list
may
be
he
must
know
how
he
stands
from
day
to
day
to
be
able
to
look
the
world
fairly
in
the
face
let
him
also
inform
his
wife
if
he
has
one
how
he
stands
with
the
world
if
his
wife
be
a
prudent
woman
she
will
help
him
to
economize
his
expenditure
and
enable
him
to
live
honourably
and
honestly
no
good
wife
will
ever
consent
to
wear
clothes
and
give
dinners
that
belong
not
to
her
but
to
her
shopkeeper
the
knowledge
of
arithmetic
is
absolutely
necessary
to
those
who
would
live
within
their
means
women
are
especially
ignorant
of
arithmetic
they
are
scarcely
taught
the
simplest
elements
for
female
teachers
think
the
information
useless
they
prefer
to
teach
languages
music
deportment
the
use
of
the
globes
all
these
may
be
important
but
the
first
four
rules
of
arithmetic
are
better
than
all
how
can
they
compare
their
expenditure
with
their
receipts
without
the
knowledge
of
addition
and
subtraction
how
can
they
know
precisely
what
to
spend
in
rent
or
clothing
or
food
or
for
service
unless
they
know
the
value
of
figures
how
can
they
check
the
accounts
of
their
tradesmen
or
their
servants
this
want
of
knowledge
of
arithmetic
is
the
cause
not
only
of
great
waste
but
of
great
misery
many
a
family
of
good
position
has
fallen
into
destitution
merely
because
of
their
ignorance
of
this
branch
of
knowledge
young
people
often
rush
into
marriage
without
reflection
a
young
man
meets
a
pretty
face
in
a
likes
it
dances
with
it
flirts
with
it
and
goes
home
to
dream
about
it
at
length
he
falls
in
love
with
it
courts
it
marries
it
and
then
he
takes
the
pretty
face
home
and
begins
to
know
something
more
about
it
all
has
as
yet
been
very
jolly
the
face
has
hitherto
been
charming
graceful
artless
and
beautiful
it
has
now
to
enter
upon
another
sphere
of
life
it
has
to
be
seen
much
closer
it
has
to
be
seen
daily
and
it
has
to
begin
housekeeping
most
newly
married
people
require
some
time
to
settle
quietly
down
together
even
those
whose
married
life
has
been
the
happiest
arrive
at
peace
and
repose
through
a
period
of
little
struggles
and
bewilderments
the
husband
does
not
all
at
once
find
his
place
nor
the
wife
hers
one
of
the
very
happiest
women
we
know
has
told
us
that
the
first
year
of
her
married
life
was
the
most
uncomfortable
of
all
she
had
so
much
to
learn
was
so
fearful
of
doing
wrong
and
had
not
yet
found
her
proper
position
but
feeling
their
way
kind
and
loving
natures
will
have
no
difficulty
in
at
last
settling
down
comfortably
and
peacefully
together
it
was
not
so
with
the
supposed
young
man
and
his
pretty
face
both
entered
upon
their
new
life
without
thinking
or
perhaps
with
exaggerated
expectations
of
its
unalloyed
happiness
they
could
not
make
allowances
for
lovers
subsiding
into
husband
and
wife
nor
were
they
prepared
for
the
little
ruffles
and
frettings
of
individual
temper
and
both
felt
disappointed
there
was
a
relaxation
of
the
little
attentions
which
are
so
novel
and
charming
to
lovers
then
the
pretty
face
when
neglected
found
relief
in
tears
there
is
nothing
of
which
men
tire
sooner
especially
when
the
tears
are
about
trifles
tears
do
not
in
such
cases
cause
sympathy
but
breed
repulsion
they
occasion
sourness
both
on
the
one
side
and
the
other
tears
are
dangerous
weapons
to
play
with
were
women
to
try
kindness
and
cheerfulness
instead
how
infinitely
happier
would
they
be
many
are
the
lives
that
are
made
miserable
by
an
indulgence
in
fretting
and
carking
until
the
character
is
indelibly
stamped
and
the
rational
enjoyment
of
life
becomes
next
to
a
moral
impossibility
mental
qualities
are
certainly
admirable
gifts
in
domestic
life
but
though
they
may
dazzle
and
delight
they
will
not
excite
love
and
affection
to
anything
like
the
same
extent
as
a
warm
and
happy
heart
they
do
not
wear
half
so
well
and
do
not
please
half
so
much
and
yet
how
little
pains
are
taken
to
cultivate
the
beautiful
quality
of
good
temper
and
happy
disposition
and
how
often
is
life
which
otherwise
might
have
been
blessed
embittered
and
soured
by
the
encouragement
of
peevish
and
fretful
habits
so
totally
destructive
of
everything
like
social
and
domestic
comfort
how
often
have
we
seen
both
men
and
women
set
themselves
round
about
as
if
with
bristles
so
that
no
one
dared
to
approach
them
without
the
fear
of
being
pricked
for
want
of
a
little
occasional
command
over
one
temper
an
amount
of
misery
is
occasioned
in
society
which
is
positively
frightful
thus
is
enjoyment
turned
into
bitterness
and
life
becomes
like
a
journey
barefooted
amongst
prickles
and
thorns
and
briars
in
the
instance
we
have
cited
the
pretty
face
soon
became
forgotten
but
as
the
young
man
had
merely
bargained
for
the
face
as
it
was
that
to
which
he
had
paid
his
attentions
that
which
he
had
vowed
to
love
honour
and
when
it
ceased
to
be
pretty
he
began
to
find
out
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
and
if
the
home
be
not
made
attractive
if
the
newly
married
man
finds
that
it
is
only
an
indifferent
he
will
gradually
absent
himself
from
it
he
will
stay
out
in
the
evenings
and
console
himself
with
cigars
cards
politics
the
theatre
the
drinking
club
and
the
poor
pretty
face
will
then
become
more
and
more
disconsolate
hopeless
and
miserable
perhaps
children
grow
up
but
neither
husband
nor
wife
know
much
about
training
them
or
keeping
them
healthy
they
are
regarded
as
toys
when
babies
dolls
when
boys
and
girls
drudges
when
young
men
and
women
there
is
scarcely
a
quiet
happy
hearty
hour
spent
during
the
life
of
such
a
luckless
couple
where
there
is
no
comfort
at
home
there
is
only
a
succession
of
petty
miseries
to
endure
where
there
is
no
cheerfulness
no
disposition
to
accommodate
to
oblige
to
sympathize
with
one
another
affection
gradually
subsides
on
both
sides
it
is
said
that
when
poverty
comes
in
at
the
door
loves
flies
out
at
the
window
but
it
is
not
from
poor
men
houses
only
that
love
flies
it
flies
quite
as
often
from
the
homes
of
the
rich
where
there
is
a
want
of
loving
and
cheerful
hearts
this
little
home
might
have
been
snug
enough
with
no
appearance
of
want
about
it
rooms
well
furnished
cleanliness
pervading
it
the
table
well
supplied
the
fire
burning
bright
and
yet
without
cheerfulness
there
wanted
the
happy
faces
radiant
with
contentment
and
good
humour
physical
comfort
after
all
forms
but
a
small
part
of
the
blessings
of
a
happy
home
as
in
all
other
concerns
of
life
it
is
the
moral
state
which
determines
the
weal
or
woe
of
the
human
condition
most
young
men
think
very
little
of
what
has
to
follow
courtship
and
marriage
they
think
little
of
the
seriousness
of
the
step
they
forget
that
when
the
pledge
has
once
been
given
there
is
no
turning
back
the
knot
can
not
be
untied
if
a
thoughtless
mistake
has
been
made
the
inevitable
results
will
nevertheless
follow
the
maxim
is
current
that
marriage
is
a
lottery
it
may
be
so
if
we
abjure
the
teachings
of
prudence
if
we
refuse
to
examine
inquire
and
think
if
we
are
content
to
choose
a
husband
or
a
wife
with
less
reflection
than
we
bestow
upon
the
hiring
of
a
servant
whom
we
can
discharge
any
day
if
we
merely
regard
attractions
of
face
of
form
or
of
purse
and
give
way
to
temporary
impulse
or
to
greedy
avarice
then
in
such
cases
marriage
does
resemble
a
lottery
in
which
you
draw
a
prize
though
there
are
a
hundred
chances
to
one
that
you
will
only
draw
a
blank
but
we
deny
that
marriage
has
any
necessary
resemblance
to
a
lottery
when
girls
are
taught
wisely
how
to
love
and
what
qualities
to
esteem
in
a
companion
for
life
instead
of
being
left
to
gather
their
stock
of
information
on
the
subject
from
the
fictitious
and
generally
false
personations
given
to
them
in
novels
and
when
young
men
accustom
themselves
to
think
of
the
virtues
graces
and
solid
acquirements
requisite
in
a
wife
with
whom
they
are
to
spend
their
days
and
on
whose
temper
and
good
sense
the
whole
happiness
of
their
home
is
to
depend
then
it
will
be
found
that
there
is
very
little
of
the
lottery
in
marriage
and
that
like
any
concern
of
business
or
of
life
the
man
or
woman
who
judges
and
acts
wisely
with
proper
foresight
and
discrimination
will
reap
the
almost
certain
consequences
in
a
happy
and
prosperous
future
true
mistakes
may
be
made
and
will
be
made
as
in
all
things
human
but
nothing
like
the
grievous
mistake
of
those
who
stake
their
happiness
in
the
venture
of
a
lottery
another
great
point
is
to
be
able
to
say
no
on
proper
occasions
when
enticements
allure
or
temptations
assail
say
no
at
once
resolutely
and
determinedly
no
i
ca
afford
it
many
have
not
the
moral
courage
to
adopt
this
course
they
consider
only
their
selfish
gratification
they
are
unable
to
practise
they
yield
give
way
and
enjoy
themselves
the
end
is
often
defalcation
fraud
and
ruin
what
is
the
verdict
of
society
in
such
cases
the
man
has
been
living
beyond
his
means
of
those
who
may
have
been
entertained
by
him
not
one
of
them
will
thank
him
not
one
of
them
will
pity
him
not
one
of
them
will
help
him
every
one
has
heard
of
the
man
who
could
say
no
he
was
friend
but
his
own
his
worst
enemy
was
himself
he
ran
rapidly
through
his
means
and
then
called
upon
his
friends
for
bonds
bails
and
promises
to
pay
after
spending
his
last
guinea
he
died
in
the
odour
of
harmless
stupidity
and
folly
his
course
in
life
seemed
to
be
directed
by
the
maxim
of
doing
for
everybody
what
everybody
asked
him
to
do
whether
it
was
that
his
heart
beat
responsive
to
every
other
heart
or
that
he
did
not
like
to
give
offence
could
never
be
ascertained
but
certain
it
is
that
he
was
rarely
asked
to
sign
a
requisition
to
promise
a
vote
to
lend
money
or
to
endorse
a
bill
that
he
did
not
comply
he
could
say
no
and
there
were
many
who
knew
him
well
who
said
he
had
not
the
moral
courage
to
do
so
his
father
left
him
a
snug
little
fortune
and
he
was
at
once
beset
by
persons
wanting
a
share
of
it
now
was
the
time
to
say
no
if
he
could
but
he
could
his
habit
of
yielding
had
been
formed
he
did
not
like
to
be
bored
could
not
bear
to
refuse
could
not
stand
importunity
and
almost
invariably
yielded
to
the
demands
made
upon
his
purse
while
his
money
lasted
he
had
no
end
of
friends
he
was
a
universal
referee
everybody
bondsman
just
sign
me
this
little
bit
of
paper
was
a
request
often
made
to
him
by
particular
friends
what
is
it
he
would
mildly
ask
for
with
all
his
simplicity
he
prided
himself
upon
his
caution
yet
he
never
refused
three
months
after
a
bill
for
a
rather
heavy
amount
would
fall
due
and
who
should
be
called
upon
to
make
it
good
but
everybody
friend
the
man
who
could
say
no
at
last
a
maltster
for
whom
he
was
bondsman
a
person
with
whom
he
had
only
a
nodding
acquaintance
suddenly
came
to
a
stand
in
his
business
ruined
by
heavy
speculations
in
funds
and
shares
when
the
man
who
could
say
no
was
called
upon
to
make
good
the
heavy
duties
due
to
the
crown
it
was
a
heavy
stroke
and
made
him
a
poor
man
but
he
never
grew
wise
he
was
a
post
against
which
every
needy
fellow
came
and
rubbed
himself
a
tap
from
which
every
thirsty
soul
could
drink
a
flitch
at
which
every
hungry
dog
had
a
pull
an
ass
on
which
every
needy
rogue
must
have
his
ride
a
mill
that
ground
everybody
corn
but
his
own
in
short
a
fellow
who
could
for
the
life
of
him
say
no
it
is
of
great
importance
to
a
man
peace
and
that
he
should
be
able
to
say
no
at
the
right
time
many
are
ruined
because
they
can
not
or
will
not
say
it
vice
often
gains
a
footing
within
us
because
we
will
not
summon
up
the
courage
to
say
no
we
offer
ourselves
too
often
as
willing
sacrifices
to
the
fashion
of
the
world
because
we
have
not
the
honesty
to
pronounce
the
little
word
the
duellist
dares
not
say
no
for
he
would
be
cut
the
beauty
hesitates
to
say
it
when
a
rich
blockhead
offers
her
his
hand
because
she
has
set
her
ambition
on
an
establishment
the
courtier
will
not
say
it
for
he
must
smile
and
promise
to
all
when
pleasure
tempts
with
its
seductions
have
the
courage
to
say
no
at
once
the
little
monitor
within
will
approve
the
decision
and
virtue
will
become
stronger
by
the
act
when
dissipation
invites
and
offers
its
secret
pleasures
boldly
say
no
if
you
do
not
if
you
acquiesce
and
succumb
virtue
will
have
gone
from
you
and
your
will
have
received
a
fatal
shock
the
first
time
may
require
an
effort
but
strength
will
grow
with
use
it
is
the
only
way
of
meeting
temptations
to
idleness
to
to
folly
to
bad
custom
to
meet
it
at
once
with
an
indignant
no
there
is
indeed
great
virtue
in
a
no
when
pronounced
at
the
right
time
a
man
may
live
beyond
his
means
until
he
has
nothing
left
he
may
die
in
debt
and
yet
society
does
not
quit
its
hold
of
him
until
he
is
laid
in
his
grave
he
must
be
buried
as
society
is
buried
he
must
have
a
fashionable
funeral
he
must
to
the
last
bear
witness
to
the
power
of
grundy
it
is
to
please
her
that
the
funeral
cloaks
hatbands
scarves
mourning
coaches
gilded
hearses
and
processions
of
mutes
are
hired
and
yet
how
worthless
and
extravagant
is
the
mummery
of
the
undertaker
grief
and
the
feigned
woe
of
the
mutes
saulies
and
plume
bearers
who
are
paid
for
their
day
parade
it
is
not
so
much
among
the
wealthy
upper
classes
that
the
mischiefs
of
this
useless
and
expensive
mummery
are
felt
as
amongst
the
middle
and
working
classes
an
expensive
funeral
is
held
to
be
respectable
people
who
are
struggling
for
front
places
in
society
make
an
effort
to
rise
into
the
region
of
mutes
and
nodding
plumes
and
like
their
betters
they
are
victimised
by
the
undertakers
these
fix
the
fashion
for
the
rest
we
must
do
as
others
do
and
most
people
submit
to
pay
the
tax
they
array
themselves
friends
and
servants
in
mourning
and
a
respectable
funeral
is
thus
purchased
the
expenditure
falls
heavily
upon
a
family
at
a
time
when
they
are
the
least
able
to
bear
it
the
has
been
taken
away
and
everything
is
left
to
the
undertaker
how
is
a
wretched
widow
in
the
midst
of
her
agony
or
how
are
orphan
children
deprived
of
the
protecting
hand
of
a
parent
to
higgle
with
a
tradesman
about
the
cheapening
of
mourning
suits
black
gloves
weepers
and
the
other
miserable
trappings
of
woe
it
is
at
such
a
moment
when
in
thousands
of
cases
every
pound
and
every
shilling
is
of
consequence
to
the
survivors
that
the
little
ready
money
they
can
scrape
together
is
lavished
without
question
upon
a
vulgar
and
extravagant
piece
of
pageantry
would
not
the
means
which
have
been
thus
foolishly
expended
in
paying
an
empty
honour
to
the
dead
be
much
better
applied
in
being
used
for
the
comfort
and
maintenance
of
the
living
the
same
evil
propagates
itself
downwards
in
society
the
working
classes
suffer
equally
with
the
middle
classes
in
proportion
to
their
means
the
average
cost
of
a
tradesman
funeral
in
england
is
about
fifty
pounds
of
a
mechanic
or
labourer
it
ranges
from
five
pounds
to
ten
pounds
in
scotland
funeral
expenses
are
considerably
lower
the
desire
to
secure
respectable
interment
for
departed
relatives
is
a
strong
and
feeling
among
the
labouring
population
and
it
does
them
honour
they
will
subscribe
for
this
purpose
when
they
will
for
no
other
the
largest
of
the
clubs
are
burial
clubs
ten
pounds
are
usually
allowed
for
the
funeral
of
a
husband
and
five
pounds
for
the
funeral
of
a
wife
as
much
as
fifteen
twenty
thirty
and
even
forty
pounds
are
occasionally
expended
on
a
funeral
in
cases
where
the
deceased
has
been
a
member
of
several
clubs
on
which
occasions
the
undertakers
meet
and
settle
between
them
their
several
shares
in
the
performance
of
the
funeral
it
is
not
unusual
to
insure
a
child
life
in
four
or
five
of
these
burial
clubs
and
we
have
heard
of
a
case
where
one
man
had
insured
payments
in
no
fewer
than
nineteen
different
burial
clubs
in
manchester
when
the
in
whose
family
a
death
has
occurred
does
not
happen
to
be
a
member
of
a
burial
club
he
is
still
governed
by
their
example
and
has
to
tax
himself
seriously
to
comply
with
the
usages
of
society
and
give
to
his
wife
or
child
a
respectable
funeral
where
it
is
the
father
of
the
family
himself
who
has
died
the
case
is
still
harder
perhaps
all
the
savings
of
his
life
are
spent
in
providing
mourning
for
his
wife
and
children
at
his
death
such
an
expense
at
such
a
time
is
ruinous
and
altogether
unjustifiable
does
putting
on
garments
of
a
certain
colour
constitute
true
mourning
is
it
not
the
heart
and
the
affections
that
mourn
rather
than
the
outside
raiment
bingham
in
speaking
of
the
primitive
christians
says
that
they
did
not
condemn
the
notion
of
going
into
a
mourning
habit
for
the
dead
nor
yet
much
approve
of
it
but
left
it
to
all
men
liberty
as
an
indifferent
thing
rather
commending
those
that
either
omitted
it
wholly
or
in
short
laid
it
aside
again
as
acting
more
according
to
the
bravery
and
philosophy
of
a
christian
john
wesley
directed
in
his
will
that
six
poor
men
should
have
twenty
shillings
each
for
carrying
his
body
to
the
grave
for
said
he
i
particularly
desire
that
there
may
be
no
hearse
no
coach
no
escutcheon
no
pomp
except
the
tears
of
those
that
loved
me
and
are
following
me
to
abraham
bosom
i
solemnly
adjure
my
executors
in
the
name
of
god
punctually
to
observe
this
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
alter
the
mourning
customs
of
our
time
we
may
anxiously
desire
to
do
so
but
the
usual
question
will
occur
what
will
people
say
what
will
the
world
say
we
involuntarily
shrink
back
and
play
the
coward
like
our
neighbours
still
common
sense
repeatedly
expressed
will
have
its
influence
and
in
course
of
time
it
can
not
fail
to
modify
the
fashions
of
society
the
last
act
of
queen
adelaide
by
which
she
dispensed
with
the
hired
mummery
of
grief
and
the
equally
characteristic
request
of
sir
robert
peel
on
his
deathbed
that
no
ceremony
nor
pomp
should
attend
his
last
obsequies
can
not
fail
to
have
their
due
effect
upon
the
fashionable
world
and
through
them
the
middle
classes
who
are
so
disposed
to
imitate
them
in
all
things
will
in
course
of
time
benefit
by
their
example
there
is
also
we
believe
a
growing
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
people
at
large
to
avoid
the
unmeaning
displays
we
refer
to
and
it
only
needs
the
repeated
and
decided
expression
of
public
opinion
to
secure
a
large
measure
of
beneficial
reform
in
this
direction
societies
have
already
been
established
in
the
united
states
the
members
of
which
undertake
to
disuse
mourning
themselves
and
to
discountenance
the
use
of
it
by
others
it
is
only
perhaps
by
association
and
the
power
of
numbers
that
this
reform
is
to
be
accomplished
for
individuals
here
and
there
could
scarcely
be
expected
to
make
way
against
the
prejudices
of
the
community

may
be
reduced
all
those
impertinent
classifications
of
gothic

celtic
tribes
white

black
men
red
men
and
people
do
not
know
what
troubles
they
are
brewing
for
themselves
when
they
run
into
debt
it
does
not
matter
for
what
the
debt
is
incurred
it
hangs
like
a
millstone
round
a
man
neck
until
he
is
relieved
of
it
it
presses
like
a
nightmare
upon
him
it
hinders
the
of
his
family
it
destroys
the
happiness
of
his
household
even
those
who
are
in
the
regular
receipt
of
large
incomes
feel
crippled
often
for
years
by
the
incubus
of
debt
weighed
down
by
this
what
can
a
man
do
to
save
to
economise
with
a
view
to
the
future
of
his
wife
and
children
a
man
in
debt
is
disabled
from
insuring
his
life
from
insuring
his
house
and
goods
from
putting
money
in
the
bank
from
buying
a
house
or
a
freehold
all
his
surplus
gains
must
go
towards
the
payment
of
his
debt
even
men
of
enormous
property
great
lords
with
vast
landed
estates
often
feel
themselves
oppressed
and
made
miserable
by
loads
of
debt
they
or
their
forefathers
having
contracted
extravagant
habits
a
taste
for
gambling
horseracing
or
expensive
living
borrow
money
on
their
estates
and
the
burden
of
debt
remains
not
perhaps
in
the
case
of
strictly
entailed
estates
for
the
aristocracy
have
contrived
so
that
their
debts
shall
be
wiped
out
at
their
death
and
they
can
thus
gratify
their
spendthrift
tastes
at
the
expense
of
the
public
the
estates
going
comparatively
unburdened
to
the
entailed
heir
but
comparatively
few
are
in
the
position
of
the
privileged
classes
in
the
case
of
the
majority
the
debts
are
inherited
with
the
estates
and
often
the
debts
are
more
than
the
estates
are
worth
thus
it
happens
that
a
large
part
of
the
lands
of
england
are
at
this
moment
the
property
of
mortgagees
and
the
greatest
men
have
been
in
debt
it
has
even
been
alleged
that
greatness
and
debt
have
a
certain
relation
to
each
other
great
men
have
great
debts
they
are
trusted
so
have
great
nations
they
are
respectable
and
have
credit
spiritless
men
have
no
debts
neither
have
spiritless
nations
nobody
will
trust
them
men
as
well
as
nations
in
debt
secure
a
widely
extended
interest
their
names
are
written
in
many
books
and
many
are
the
conjectures
formed
as
to
whether
they
will
pay
or
not
the
man
who
has
no
debts
slips
through
the
world
comparatively
unnoticed
while
he
who
is
in
everybody
books
has
all
eyes
fixed
upon
him
his
health
is
enquired
after
with
interest
and
if
he
goes
into
foreign
countries
his
return
is
anxiously
looked
for
the
creditor
is
usually
depicted
as
a
severe
man
with
a
hard
visage
while
the
debtor
is
an
generous
man
ready
to
help
and
entertain
everybody
he
is
the
object
of
general
sympathy
when
goldsmith
was
dunned
for
his
and
arrested
for
the
rent
of
his
apartments
who
would
think
of
pitying
the
or
the
landlady
it
is
the
man
in
debt
who
is
the
prominent
feature
of
the
piece
and
all
our
sympathy
is
reserved
for
him
what
were
you
asked

god
preserve
me
from
ever
being
without
them
do
you
think
there
is
anything
divine
in
lending
or
in
crediting
others
no
to
owe
is
the
true
heroic
virtue
yet
whatever
may
be
said
in
praise
of
debt
it
has
unquestionably
a
very
seedy
side
the
man
in
debt
is
driven
to
resort
to
many
sorry
expedients
to
live
he
is
the
victim
of
duns
and
sheriff
officers
few
can
treat
them
with
the
indifference
that
sheridan
did
who
put
them
into
livery
to
wait
upon
his
guests
the
debtor
starts
and
grows
pale
at
every
knock
at
his
door
his
friends
grow
cool
and
his
relatives
shun
him
he
is
ashamed
to
go
abroad
and
has
no
comfort
at
home
he
becomes
crabbed
morose
and
querulous
losing
all
pleasure
in
life
he
wants
the
passport
to
enjoyment
and
respect
money
he
has
only
his
debts
and
these
make
him
suspected
despised
and
snubbed
he
lives
in
the
slough
of
despond
he
feels
degraded
in
others
eyes
as
well
as
in
his
own
he
must
submit
to
impertinent
demands
which
he
can
only
put
off
by
sham
excuses
he
has
ceased
to
be
his
own
master
and
has
lost
the
independent
bearing
of
a
man
he
seeks
to
excite
pity
and
pleads
for
time
a
sharp
attorney
pounces
on
him
and
suddenly
he
feels
himself
in
the
vulture
gripe
he
tries
a
friend
or
a
relative
but
all
that
he
obtains
is
a
civil
leer
and
a
cool
repulse
he
tries
a
and
if
he
succeeds
he
is
only
out
of
the
into
the
fire
it
is
easy
to
see
what
the
end
will
be
a
life
of
mean
shifts
and
expedients
perhaps
ending
in
the
gaol
or
the
workhouse
can
a
man
keep
out
of
debt
is
there
a
possibility
of
avoiding
the
moral
degradation
which
accompanies
it
could
not
debt
be
dispensed
with
altogether
and
man
independence
preserved
secure
there
is
only
one
way
of
doing
this
by
living
within
the
means
unhappily
this
is
too
little
the
practice
in
modern
times
we
incur
debt
trusting
to
the
future
for
the
opportunity
of
defraying
it
we
can
not
resist
the
temptation
to
spend
money
one
will
have
fine
furniture
and
live
in
a
house
another
will
have
wines
and
a
box
at
the
opera
a
third
must
give
dinners
and
all
good
things
in
their
way
but
not
to
be
indulged
in
if
they
can
not
be
paid
for
is
it
not
a
shabby
thing
to
pretend
to
give
dinners
if
the
real
parties
who
provide
them
are
the
butcher
the
poulterer
and
the
whom
you
are
in
debt
to
and
can
not
pay
a
man
has
no
business
to
live
in
a
style
which
his
income
can
not
support
or
to
mortgage
his
earnings
of
next
week
or
of
next
year
in
order
to
live
luxuriously
the
whole
system
of
debt
by
means
of
which
we
forestall
and
anticipate
the
future
is
wrong
they
are
almost
as
much
to
blame
who
give
credit
and
encourage
customers
to
take
credit
as
those
are
who
incur
debts
a
man
knows
what
his
actual
position
is
if
he
pays
his
way
as
he
goes
he
can
keep
within
his
means
and
so
apportion
his
expenditure
as
to
reserve
a
fund
of
savings
against
a
time
of
need
he
is
always
balanced
up
and
if
he
buys
nothing
but
what
he
pays
for
in
cash
he
can
not
fail
to
be
on
the
credit
side
of
his
household
accounts
at
the
year
end
but
once
let
him
commence
the
practice
of
running
up
bills
one
at
the
tailor
another
at
the
dressmaker
and
milliner
another
at
the
butcher
another
at
the
grocer
and
so
on
and
he
never
knows
how
he
stands
he
is
deceived
into
debt
the
road
is
made
smooth
and
pleasant
for
him
things
flow
into
the
house
for
which
he
does
not
seem
to
pay
but
they
are
all
set
down
against
him
and
at
the
year
end
when
the
bills
come
in
he
is
ready
to
lift
up
his
hands
in
dismay
then
he
finds
that
the
sweet
of
the
honey
will
not
repay
for
the
smart
of
the
sting
it
is
the
same
as
respects
the
poorer
classes
not
many
years
since
parliament
passed
a
law
facilitating
the
establishment
of
small
loan
societies
for
the
purpose
of
helping
small
tradesmen
and
poor
people
generally
to
raise
money
on
an
emergency
the
law
was
at
once
pounced
upon
by
the
numerous
race
of
graballs
as
a
means
of
putting
money
in
their
purse
they
gave
the
working
classes
facilities
for
running
into
debt
and
for
mortgaging
their
future
industry
a
few
men
desirous
of
making
money
would
form
themselves
into
a
loan
club
and
offer
sums
of
money
ostensibly
at
five
per
cent
interest
repayable
in
weekly
instalments
the
labouring
people
eagerly
availed
themselves
of
the
facility
for
getting
into
debt
one
wanted
money
for
a
spree
another
wanted
money
for
a
suit
of
clothes
a
third
for
an
clock
and
so
on
and
instead
of
saving
the
money
beforehand
they
preferred
getting
the
money
from
the
club
keeping
themselves
in
difficulties
and
poverty
until
the
debt
was
paid
off
such
a
practice
is
worse
than
living
from
hand
to
mouth
it
is
living
upon
one
own
vitals
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
the
partners
in
the
loan
club
made
money
suppose
that
they
advanced
ten
pounds
for
three
months
at
five
per
cent
it
is
repayable
in
weekly
instalments
at
ten
shillings
a
week
the
repayments
commencing
the
very
first
week
after
the
advance
has
been
made
but
though
ten
shillings
are
repaid
weekly
until
the
debt
is
wiped
off
interest
at
five
per
cent
is
charged
upon
the
whole
amount
until
the
last
instalment
is
paid
off
so
that
though
the
nominal
interest
is
five
per
it
goes
on
increasing
until
during
the
last
week
it
reaches
the
enormous
rate
of
one
hundred
per
this
is
what
is
called
eating
the
calf
in
the
cow
belly
men
of
genius
are
equally
facile
in
running
into
debt
genius
has
no
necessary
connection
with
prudence
or
nor
does
it
exercise
any
influence
over
the
common
rules
of
arithmetic
which
are
rigid
and
inflexible
men
of
genius
are
often
superior
to
what
bacon
calls
the
wisdom
of
business
yet
bacon
himself
did
not
follow
his
own
advice
but
was
ruined
by
his
improvidence
he
was
in
straits
and
difficulties
when
a
youth
and
in
still
greater
straits
and
difficulties
when
a
man
his
life
was
splendid
but
his
excessive
expenditure
involved
him
in
debts
which
created
a
perpetual
craving
for
money
one
day
in
passing
out
to
his
antechambers
where
his
followers
waited
for
his
appearance
he
said

as
instances
of
the
harsh
treatment
of

by
the

in
proof
of
the
social
disabilities
of
literary
men
and
artists
it
has
been
held
that
society
should
be
more
indulgent
to
its
men
of
genius
and
that

should
do
something
more
for
them
than
it
now
does

nothing
that
society
or

could
do

may
pity
poor
goldsmith

we
can
not
fail
to
see
that
he
was
throughout
his
own
enemy
his
gains
were
large
amounting
to
about
in
fourteen
years
representing
a
much
larger
sum
of
money
at
the
present
day
for
his
history
of
the
earth
and
animated
nature
he
received
and
the
book
was
at
best
but
a
clever
compilation
johnson
said
of
him
that
if
he
can
tell
a
horse
from
a
cow
that
is
the
extent
of
his
knowledge
of
zoology
the
representation
of

so

with
his
other
works
he
was
as
successful
as
johnson
was

then
he
had
not
sobriety
and

the

on

a
resolution
which

afterwards
wisely
abandoned

staggered

accumulated

he
married
probably
in
the
expectation
that
his
wife
fortune
would
release
him

her
money
was
locked
up

the
step
instead
of
relieving
him
brought
only
an
accession

there
is
the
greatest
difference
in
the
manner
in
which
men
bear
the
burden
of
debt
some
feel
it
to
be
no
burden
at
all
others
bear
it
very
lightly
whilst
others
look
upon
creditors
in
the
light
of
persecutors
and
themselves
in
the
light
of
martyrs
but
where
the
moral
sense
is
a
little
more
keen
where
men
use
the
goods
of
others
without
rendering
the
due
equivalent
of
money
where
they
wear
unpaid
clothes
eat
unpaid
meat
drink
unpaid
wines
and
entertain
guests
at
the
expense
of
the
butcher
grocer
and
greengrocer
they
must
necessarily
feel
that
their
conduct
is
of
the
essence
not
only
of
shabbiness
but
of
dishonesty
and
the
burden
must
then
bear
very
heavily

debtors
the
proportion
is
considerable

also
made

sir
walter
scott
life
is
the
manner
in
which
he
conducted
himself
after
the
failure
of
the
publishing
house
of
constable
and
with
which
he
had
become
deeply
involved
he
had
built
abbotsford
become
a
laird
was
sheriff
of
his
county
and
thought
himself
a
rich
man
when
suddenly
the
constable
firm
broke
down
and
he
found
himself
indebted
to
the
world
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
it
is
very
hard
he
said
when
the
untoward
news
reached
him
thus
to
lose
all
the
labour
of
a
lifetime
and
to
be
made
a
poor
man
at
last
but
if
god
grant
me
health
and
strength
for
a
few
years
longer
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
shall
redeem
it
all
everybody
thought
him
a
ruined
man
and
he
almost
felt
himself
to
be
so
but
his
courage
never
gave
way
when
his
creditors
proposed
to
him
a
composition
his
sense
of
honour
forbade
his
listening
to
them
no
gentlemen
he
replied
time
and
i
against
any
two
though
the
debts
had
been
contracted
by
others
he
had
made
himself
legally
responsible
for
them
and
strong
in
his
principle
of
integrity
he
determined
if
he
could
to
pay
them
off
to
the
last
farthing
and
he
set
himself
to
do
it
but
it
cost
him
his
life
he
parted
with
his
town
house
and
furniture
delivered
over
his
personal
effects
to
be
held
in
trust
for
his
creditors
and
bound
himself
to
discharge
a
certain
amount
of
his
liabilities
annually
this
he
did
by
undertaking
new
literary
works
some
of
them
of
great
magnitude
the
execution
of
which
though
they
enabled
him
to
discharge
a
large
portion
of
his
debt
added
but
little
to
his
reputation
one
of
his
first
tasks
was
his
life
of
napoleon
buonaparte
in
nine
volumes
which
he
wrote
in
the
midst
of
pain
sorrow
and
ruin
in
about
thirteen
months
receiving
for
it
about
fourteen
thousand
pounds
even
though
struck
by
paralysis
he
went
on
writing
until
in
about
four
years
he
had
discharged
about
of
the
debt
for
which
he
was
responsible
an
achievement
probably
unparalleled
in
the
history
of
letters
the
sacrifices
and
efforts
which
he
made
during
the
last
few
years
of
his
life
even
while
paralyzed
and
scarcely
able
to
hold
his
pen
exhibit
scott
in
a
truly
heroic
light
he
bore
up
with
unconquerable
spirit
to
the
last
when
his
doctor
expostulated
with
him
against
his
excessive
he
replied
if
i
were
to
be
idle
i
should
go
mad
in
comparison
to
this
death
is
no
risk
to
shrink
from
shortly
before
his
last
fatal
attack
when
sitting
dozing
in
his
chair
on
the
grass
in
front
of
the
house
at
abbotsford
he
suddenly
roused
himself
threw
off
the
plaids
which
covered
him
and
exclaimed
this
is
sad
idleness
take
me
to
my
own
room
and
fetch
the
keys
of
my
desk
they
wheeled
him
into
his
study
and
put
pens
and
paper
before
him
but
he
could
not
grasp
the
pen
he
could
not
write
and
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
his
spirit
was
not
conquered
but
his
bodily
powers
were
exhausted
and
shattered
and
when
at
length
he
died
he
fell
asleep
like
a
child
scott
felt
what
every
sensitive
nature
must
feel
that
poverty
is
a
much
lighter
burden
to
bear
than
debt
there
is
nothing
ignominious
about
poverty
it
may
even
serve
as
a
healthy
stimulus
to
great
spirits
under
gold
mountains
and
thrones
said
jean
paul
lie
buried
many
spiritual
giants
richter
even
held
that
poverty
was
to
be
welcomed
so
that
it
came
not
too
late
in
life
and
doubtless
scott
burden
was
all
the
heavier
to
bear
because
it
came
upon
him
in
his
declining
years
shakespeare
was
originally
a
poor
man
it
is
a
question
says
carlyle
whether
had
not
want
discomfort
and
distress
warrants
been
busy
at
shakespeare
had
not
lived
killing
calves
or
combing
wool
to
milton
and
dryden
narrow
means
we
probably
owe
the
best
part
of
their
works
johnson
was
a
very
poor
man
and
a
very
brave
one
he
never
knew
what
wealth
was
his
mind
was
always
greater
than
his
fortune
and
it
is
the
mind
that
makes
the
man
rich
or
poor
happy
or
miserable
gruff
and
bluff
exterior
covered
a
manly
and
noble
nature
he
had
early
known
poverty
and
debt
and
wished
himself
clear
of
both
when
at
college
his
feet
appeared
through
his
shoes
but
he
was
too
poor
to
buy
new
ones
his
head
was
full
of
learning
but
his
pockets
were
empty
how
he
struggled
through
distress
and
difficulty
during
his
first
years
in
london
the
reader
can
learn
from
his
life
he
bedded
and
boarded
for
a
day
and
when
too
poor
to
pay
for
a
bed
he
wandered
with
savage
whole
nights
in
the
streets
he
struggled
on
manfully
never
whining
at
his
lot
but
trying
to
make
the
best
of
it
footnote
he
said
a
man
might
live
in
a
garret
at
a
week
few
people
would
inquire
where
he
lodged
and
if
they
did
it
was
easy
to
say
i
am
to
be
found
at
such
a
place
by
spending
threepence
in
a
coffee
house
he
might
be
for
some
hours
every
day
in
very
good
company
he
might
dine
for
sixpence
breakfast
on
bread
and
milk
for
a
penny
and
do
without
supper
on
he
went
abroad
and
paid
visits
boswell
of
these
early
sorrows
and
struggles
of
johnson
left
their
scars
upon
his
nature
but
they
also
enlarged
and
enriched
his
experience
as
well
as
widened
his
range
of
human
sympathy
even
when
in
his
greatest
distress
he
had
room
in
his
heart
for
others
whose
necessities
were
greater
than
his
own
and
he
was
never
wanting
in
his
help
to
those
who
needed
it
or
were
poorer
than
himself
from
his
sad
experience
no
one
could
speak
with
greater
authority
on
the
subject
of
debt
than
johnson
do
not
accustom
yourself
he
wrote
to
boswell
to
consider
debt
only
an
inconvenience
you
will
find
it
a
calamity
let
it
be
your
first
care
not
to
be
in
any
man
debt
whatever
you
have
spend
less
frugality
is
not
only
the
basis
of
quiet
but
of
beneficence
to
simpson
the
barrister
he
wrote
small
debts
are
like
small
shot
they
are
rattling
on
every
side
and
can
scarcely
be
escaped
without
a
wound
great
debts
are
like
cannon
of
loud
noise
but
little
danger
you
must
therefore
be
enabled
to
discharge
petty
debts
that
you
may
have
leisure
with
security
to
struggle
with
the
rest
sir
said
he
to
the
patient
and
receptive
boswell
get
as
much
peace
of
mind
as
you
can
and
keep
within
your
income
and
you
wo
go
far
wrong
men
who
live
by
their
wits
their
talents
or
their
genius
have
somehow
or
other
acquired
the
character
of
being
improvident
charles
nodier
writing
about
a
distinguished
genius
said
of
him
in
the
life
of
intelligence
and
art
he
was
an
angel
in
the
common
practical
life
of
every
day
he
was
a
child
the
same
might
be
said
of
many
great
writers
and
artists
the
greatest
of
them
have
been
so
devoted
heart
and
soul
to
their
special
work
that
they
have
not
cared
to
think
how
the
efforts
of
their
genius
might
be
converted
into
pounds
shillings
and
pence
had
they
placed
the
money
consideration
first
probably
the
world
would
not
have
inherited
the
products
of
their
genius
milton
would
not
have
laboured
for
so
many
years
at
his
paradise
lost
merely
for
the
sake
of
the
five
pounds
for
which
he
sold
the
first
edition
to
the
publisher
nor
would
schiller
have
gone
on
toiling
for
twenty
years
up
to
the
topmost
pinnacles
of
thought
merely
for
the
sake
of
the
bare
means
of
living
which
he
earned
by
his
work
at
the
same
time
men
of
genius
should
not
disregard
the
common
rules
of
arithmetic
if
they
spend
more
than
they
earn
they
will
run
into
debt
nor
will
complaining
of
the
harshness
of
the
world
keep
them
out
of
it
they
have
to
stand
or
fall
on
their
merits
as
men
and
if
they
are
not
provident
they
will
suffer
the
same
consequences
as
others
thackeray
in
painting
the
character
of
captain
shandon
in
his
pendennis
gave
considerable
offence
to
the
literary
profession
yet
he
only
spoke
the
truth
if
a
lawyer
said
he
or
a
soldier
or
a
parson
outruns
his
income
and
does
not
pay
his
bills
he
must
go
to
gaol
and
an
author
must
go
too
literary
men
are
not
neglected
because
they
are
literary
men
but
they
have
no
right
to
expect
that
society
will
overlook
their
social
offences
because
they
are
literary
men
it
is
necessary
for
the
world
sake
as
well
as
for
their
own
sake
that
literary
men
and
artists
should
take
care
to
provide
against
the
evil
day
like
other
people
imagination
and
art
says
madame
de
staël
have
need
to
look
after
their
own
comfort
and
happiness
in
this
world
the
world
ought
to
help
them
generously
all
good
men
ought
to
help
them
but
what
is
better
than
all
they
ought
to
help
themselves

to

it
is
a
duty
that
belongs
to
men
as
individuals

as

we
are
enjoined
to
help
the
widow
and
the
fatherless
in
their
affliction
and
as

because

claims
of

that
he
shall

john
pounds

influence
ragged
schools
were
established

was

and

enough
from
his
earnings
to
buy
food
for
his
pupils
he
attracted
them
by
his
kindness
sometimes
by
a
hot
potato
he
taught
them
and
sent
them
out
into
the
world
fortified
by
his
good
example
to
work
in

and
do
their

towards

a
fine
instance
of
gentleness
and
generosity
is
recorded
in
memoir
of
donne
when
the
latter
long
straitened
in
his
means
had
entered
upon
the
deanery
of
paul
and
was
thereby
provided
with
an
income
more
than
sufficient
for
all
his
wants
he
felt
that
those
means
had
been
entrusted
to
him
for
good
uses
and
to
employ
for
human
help
and
to
the
glory
of
the
giver
thereof
at
the
foot
of
a
private
account
to
which
god
and
his
angels
only
were
witnesses
with
him
donne
computed
first
his
revenue
then
what
was
given
to
the
poor
and
other
pious
uses
and
lastly
what
rested
for
him
and
his
and
having
done
that
he
then
blessed
each
year
poor
remainder
with
a
thankful
prayer
donne
did
most
of
his
good
in
secret
letting
not
his
right
hand
know
what
his
left
hand
did
he
redeemed
many
poor
from
prison
helped
many
a
poor
scholar
and
employed
a
trusty
servant
or
a
discreet
friend
to
distribute
his
bounty
where
it
was
most
needed
a
friend
whom
he
had
known
in
days
of
affluence
having
by
a
too
liberal
heart
and
carelessness
become
decayed
in
his
estate
and
reduced
to
poverty
donne
sent
him
a
hundred
pounds
but
the
decayed
gentleman
returned
it
with
thanks
saying
that
he
wanted
it
not
for
says
walton
in
narrating
the
event
as
there
be
some
spirits
so
generous
as
to
labour
to
conceal
and
endure
a
sad
poverty
rather
than
expose
themselves
to
those
blushes
that
attend
the
confession
of
it
so
there
be
others
to
whom
nature
and
grace
have
afforded
such
sweet
and
compassionate
souls
as
to
pity
and
prevent
the
distresses
of
mankind
which
i
have
mentioned
because
of
donne
reply
whose
answer
was
know
you
want
not
what
will
sustain
nature
for
a
little
will
do
that
but
my
desire
is
that
you
who
in
the
days
of
your
plenty
have
cheered
and
raised
the
hearts
of
so
many
of
your
dejected
friends
would
now
receive
this
from
me
and
use
it
as
a
cordial
for
the
cheering
of
your
own
and
upon
these
terms
it
was
received
the
truth
is
that
we
very
much
exaggerate
the
power
of
riches
immense
subscriptions
are
got
up
for
the
purpose
of
reforming
men
from
their
sinful
courses
and
turning
them
from
evil
to
good
and
yet
subscriptions
will
not
do
it
it
is
character
that
can
do
the
work
money
never
can
great
changes
in
society
can
never
be
effected
through
riches
to
turn
men
from
intemperance
improvidence
and
irreligion
and
to
induce
them
to
seek
their
happiness
in
the
pursuit
of
proper
and
noble
objects
requires
earnest
purpose
honest
and
hard
work
money
may
help
in
many
respects
but
money
by
itself
can
do
nothing
the
apostle
paul
planted
the
knowledge
of
the
christian
religion
over
half
the
roman
empire
yet
he
supported
himself
by
and
not
by
collecting
subscriptions
men
of
anxious
earnest
honest
hearts
are
far
more
wanted
than
rich
men
willing
to
give
money
in
charity
nothing
is
so
much
as
the
power
of
money
all
the
people
who
are
looking
out
for
front
seats
in
society
think
it
the
one
thing
needful
they
may
be
but
they
are
also
the
hypocritical
professions
of
some
people
with
a
view
to
elicit
the
good
opinion
of
others
in
the
teeth
of
their
daily
life
and
practice
is
nothing
short
of
disgusting

turpitude

some

idolatrous

upon

day
and
earn
it
when

consulted
him
about
his
health
abernethy
answer
was
cut
off
the
supplies
and
the
enemy
will
soon
leave
the
citadel
the
labourer
who
feels
little
and
thinks
less
has
the
digestion
of
an
ostrich
while
the
is
never
allowed
to
forget
that
he
has
a
stomach
and
is
obliged
to
watch
every
mouthful
that
he
eats
industry
and
indigestion
are
two
things
seldom
found
united
many
people
envy
the
possessions
of
the
rich
but
will
not
pass
through
the
risks
the
fatigues
or
the
dangers
of
acquiring
them
it
is
related
of
the
duke
of
dantzic
that
an
old
comrade
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
many
years
called
upon
him
at
his
hotel
in
paris
and
seemed
amazed
at
the
luxury
of
his
apartments
the
richness
of
his
furniture
and
the
magnificence
of
his
gardens
the
duke
supposing
that
he
saw
in
his
old
comrade
face
a
feeling
of
jealousy
said
to
him
bluntly
you
may
have
all
that
you
see
before
you
on
one
condition
what
is
that
said
his
friend
it
is
that
you
will
place
yourself
twenty
paces
off
and
let
me
fire
at
you
with
a
musket
a
hundred
times
i
will
certainly
not
accept
your
offer
at
that
price
well
replied
the
marshal
to
gain
all
that
you
see
before
you
i
have
faced
more
than
a
thousand
gunshots
fired
at
not
move
than
ten
paces
off
the
duke
of
marlborough
often
faced
death
he
became
rich
and
left
a
million
and
a
half
to
his
descendants
to
squander
the
duke
was
a
penurious
man
he
is
said
to
have
scolded
his
servant
for
lighting
four
candles
in
his
tent
when
prince
eugene
called
upon
him
to
hold
a
conference
before
the
battle
of
blenheim
swift
said
of
the
duke
i
dare
hold
a
wager
that
in
all
his
compaigns
he
was
never
known
to
lose
his
baggage
but
this
merely
showed
his
consummate
generalship
when
ill
and
feeble
at
bath
he
is
said
to
have
walked
home
from
the
rooms
to
his
lodgings
to
save
sixpence
and
yet
this
may
be
excused
for
he
may
have
walked
home
for
exercise
he
is
certainly
known
to
have
given
a
thousand
pounds
to
a
young
and
deserving
soldier
who
wished
to
purchase
a
commission
when
bolingbroke
was
reminded
of
one
of
the
weaknesses
of
marlborough
he
observed
he
was
so
great
a
man
that
i
forgot
that
he
had
that
defect
it
is
no
disgrace
to
be
poor
the
praise
of
honest
poverty
has
often
been
sung
when
a
man
will
not
stoop
to
do
wrong
when
he
will
not
sell
himself
for
money
when
he
will
not
do
a
dishonest
act
then
his
poverty
is
most
honourable
but
the
man
is
not
poor
who
can
pay
his
way
and
save
something
besides
he
who
pays
cash
for
all
that
he
purchases
is
not
poor
but
well
off
he
is
in
a
happier
condition
than
the
idle
gentleman
who
runs
into
debt
and
is
clothed
shod
and
fed
at
the
expense
of
his
tailor
shoemaker
and
butcher
montesquieu
says
that
a
man
is
not
poor
because
he
has
nothing
but
he
is
poor
when
he
will
not
or
can
not
work
the
man
who
is
able
and
willing
to
work
is
better
off
than
the
man
who
possesses
a
thousand
crowns
without
the
necessity
for
working
nothing
sharpens
a
man
wits
like
poverty
hence
many
of
the
greatest
men
have
originally
been
poor
men
poverty
often
purifies
and
braces
a
man
morals
to
spirited
people
difficult
tasks
are
usually
the
most
delightful
ones
if
we
may
rely
upon
the
testimony
of
history
men
are
brave
truthful
and
magnanimous
not
in
proportion
to
their
wealth
but
in
proportion
to
their
smallness
of
means
and
the
best
are
often
the
poorest
always
supposing
that
they
have
sufficient
to
meet
their
temporal
wants
a
divine
has
said
that
god
has
created
poverty
but
he
has
not
created
misery
and
there
is
certainly
a
great
difference
between
the
two
while
honest
poverty
is
honourable
misery
is
humiliating
inasmuch
as
the
latter
is
for
the
most
part
the
result
of
misconduct
and
often
of
idleness
and
drunkenness
poverty
is
no
disgrace
to
him
who
can
put
up
with
it
but
he
who
finds
the
staff
once
get
warm
in
his
hand
never
does
any
good
but
a
great
amount
of
evil
the
poor
are
often
the
happiest
of
people
far
more
so
than
the
rich
but
though
they
may
be
envied
no
one
will
be
found
willing
to
take
their
place
moore
has
told
the
story
of
the
eastern
despot
who
sent
a
messenger
to
travel
through
the
world
in
order
to
find
out
the
happiest
man
when
discovered
the
messenger
was
immediately
to
seize
him
take
his
shirt
off
his
back
and
bring
it
to
the
caliph
the
messenger
found
the
happiest
man
in
an
irishman
happy
dancing
and
flourishing
his
shillelagh
but
when
the
ambassador
proceeded
to
seize
him
and
undress
him
he
found
that
the
irishman
had
got
no
shirt
to
his
back
the
portion
of
agur
is
unquestionably
the
best
remove
far
from
me
vanity
and
lies
give
me
neither
poverty
nor
riches
feed
me
with
food
convenient
for
me
the
unequal
distribution
of
the
disposition
to
be
happy
is
of
far
greater
importance
than
the
unequal
distribution
of
wealth
the
disposition
to
be
content
and
satisfied

hume
is
at

equal

montaigne
has
observed
that
fortune
confers
but
little
human
good
or
ill
does
not

it
is
but
the
seed
of
good
which
the
soul
infinitely
stronger
than
wealth
changes
and
applies
as
it
pleases

is
thus
the
only
cause

a
happy

unhappy
disposition

may

to
take
another
view
of
the
effects
of
that
charity
produces
unmixed
good
is
very
much
questioned
charity
like
man
is
sometimes
blind
and
frequently
misguided
unless
money
is
wisely
distributed
it
will
frequently
do
more
harm
than
good
if
charity
could
help
or
elevate
the
poor
london
would
now
be
the
happiest
city
in
the
world
for
about
three
millions
of
money
are
spent
on
charity
and
about
one
in
every
three
of
the
london
population
are
relieved
by
charitable

it
is
very
easy
to
raise
money
for

lists
constantly
attest
the
fact
a
rich
man
is
asked
by
some
influential
person
for
money
it
is
very
easy
to
give
it
it
saves
time
to
give
it
it
is
considered
a
religious
duty
to
give
it
yet
to
give
money
unthinkingly
to
give
it
without
considering
how
it
is
to
be
used
instead
of
being
for
the
good
of
our
may
often
prove
the
greatest
injury
we
could
inflict
upon
them
true
benevolence
does
not
consist
in
giving
money
nor
can
charitable
donations
given
indiscriminately
to
the
poor
have
any
other
effect
than
to
sap
the
foundations
of
and
break
down
the
very
outworks
of
virtue
itself
there
are
many
forms
of
benevolence
which
create
the
very
evils
they
are
intended
to
cure
and
encourage
the
poorer
classes
in
the
habit
of
dependence
upon
the
charity
of
others
to
the
neglect
of
those
far
healthier
means
of
social
which
lie
within
their
own
reach
one
would
think
that
three
million
a
year
were
sufficient
to
relieve
all
the
actual
distress
that
exists
in
london
yet
the
distress
notwithstanding
all
the
money
spent
upon
it
goes
on
increasing
may
not
the
money
spent
in
charity
create
the
distress
it
relieves
besides
creating
other
distress
which
it
fails
to
relieve
uneducated
and
idle
people
will
not
exert
themselves
for
a
living
when
they
have
the
hope
of
obtaining
the
living
without
exertion
who
will
be
frugal
and
provident
when
charity
offers
all
that
frugality
and
providence
can
confer
does
not
the
gift
of
the
advantages
comforts
and
rewards
of
industry
without
the
necessity
of
labouring
for
them
tend
to
sap
the
very
foundations
of
energy
and
is
not
the
circumstance
that
poverty
is
the
only
requisite
qualification
on
the
part
of
the
applicant
for
charity
calculated
to
tempt
the
people
to
to
dissipation
and
to
those
courses
of
life
which
keep
them
poor
men
who
will
not
struggle
and
exert
themselves
are
those
who
are
helped
first
the
worst
sort
of
persons
are
made
comfortable
whilst
the
man
who
disdains
to
throw
himself
upon
charity
is
compelled
to
pay
rates
for
the
maintenance
of
the
idle
charity
stretches
forth
its
hand
to
the
rottenest
parts
of
society
it
rarely
seeks
out
or
helps
the
struggling
and
the
honest
as
carlyle
has
said
o
my
astonishing
benevolent
friends
that
never
think
of
meddling
with
the
material
while
it
continues
sound
that
stress
and
strain
it
with
new
rates
and
assessments
till
even
it
has
given
way
and
declared
itself
rotten
whereupon
you
greedily
snatch
at
it
and
say
let
us
try
to
do
some
good
upon
it
the
charity
which
merely
consists
in
giving
is
an
idle
indulgence
often
an
idle
vice
the
mere
giving
of
money
will
never
do
the
work
of
philanthropy
as
a
recent
writer
has
said
the
crimes
of
the
virtuous
the
blasphemies
of
the
pious
and
the
follies
of
the
wise
would
scarcely
fill
a
larger
volume
than
the
cruelties
of
the
humane
in
this
world
a
large
part
of
the
occupation
of
the
wise
has
been
to
neutralize
the
efforts
of
the
good
public
charities
said
the
late
lord
lytton
are
too
often
merely
a
bonus
to
public
indolence
and
vice
what
a
dark
lesson
of
the
fallacy
of
human
wisdom
does
this
knowledge
strike
into
the
heart
what
a
waste
of
the
materials
of
kindly
sympathies
what
a
perversion
individual
mistakes
can
cause
even
in
the
virtues
of
a
nation
charity
is
a
feeling
dear
to
the
pride
of
the
human
heart
it
is
an
aristocratic
emotion
mahomet
testified
his
deep
knowledge
of

allowed
the

licentiousness

no
wonder
by
the
prevailing
system
of

they
have
been
in
this
carnal
spirit
they
have
been
justified
in
those
selfish
expectations
instead
of
being
allowed
to
learn
the
great
and
salutary
lesson
of
providence
that
there
is
a
necessary
connection
between
their
conduct
and
their
condition
they
have
by
this
artificial
system
been
taught
that
indigence
is
sufficient
to
constitute
a
claim
to
relief
they
have
been
thus
encouraged
in
improvidence
immorality
fraud
and
hypocrisy
the
truest
philanthropists
are
those
who
endeavour
to
prevent
misery
dependence
and
destitution
and
especially
those
who
diligently
help
the
poor
to

themselves
this

the
great
advantage
of
the
parochial
association
they
bring
themselves
into
close
communication
with
the
people
in
the
several
parishes
of
london
and
endeavour
to
assist
them
in
many
ways
but
they
avoid
giving
indiscriminate
alms
their
objects
are
to
help
the
poor
to
help
themselves
and
to
raise
them
by
making
them
feel
that
they
help
themselves
there

room
for
philanthropy

american
merchant
was
of
a
different
character
girard
was
a
native
of
bordeaux
an
orphan
at
an
early
age
he
was
put
on
board
a
ship
as
a
cabin
boy
he
made
his
first
voyage
to
north
america
when
about
ten
or
twelve
years
old
he
had
little
education
and
only
a
limited
acquaintance
with
reading
and
writing
he
worked
hard
he
gradually
improved
in
means
so
that
he
was
able
to
set
up
a
store
whilst
living
in
water
street
new
york
he
fell
in
love
with
polly
luna
the
daughter
of
a
caulker
the
father
forbade
the
marriage
but
girard
persevered
and
at
length
he
won
and
married
polly
lum
it
proved
a
most
unfortunate
marriage
his
wife
had
no
sympathy
with
him
and
he
became
cross
snappish
morose
he
took
to
sea
again
and
at
forty
he
commanded
his
own
sloop
and
was
engaged
in
the
coasting
trade
between
new
york
philadelphia
and
new
orleans
then
he
settled
in
philadelphia
and
became
a
merchant
he
devoted
his
whole
soul
to
his
business
for
he
had
determined
to
become
rich
he
practised
the
most
rigid
economy
he
performed
any
work
by
which
money
could
be
made
he
shut
his
heart
against
the
blandishments
of
life
the
desire
for
wealth
seems
to
have
possessed
his
soul
his
life
was
one
of
unceasing
labour
remember
that
girard
was
unhappy
at
home
his
nature
might
have
been
softened
had
he
been
blessed
with
a
happy
wife
he
led
ten
miserable
years
with
her
and
then
she
became
insane
she
lay
for
about
twenty
years
in
the
pennsylvania
hospital
and
died
there
yet
there
was
something
more
than
hardness
and
harshness
in
girard
there
was
a
deep
of
humanity
in
him
when
the
yellow
fever
broke
out
in
philadelphia
in
his
better
nature
showed
itself
the
people
were
smitten
to
death
by
thousands
nurses
could
not
be
found
to
attend
the
patients
in
the
hospital
it
was
regarded
as
certain
death
to
nurse
the
sick
wealth
had
no
power
to
bribe
nor
beauty
to
charm
the
oppressor
but
all
perished
alike
beneath
the
scourge
of
his
anger
only
alas
i
the
poor
who
had
neither
friends
nor
attendants
crept
away
to
die
in
the
almshouse
home
of
the
homeless
it
was
at
this
time
when
many
were
stricken
with
fever
that
girard
abandoned
his
business
and
offered
his
services
as
superintendent
of
the
public
hospital
he
had
peter
helm
for
his
associate
business
faculty
immediately
displayed
itself
his
powers
of
organization
were
immense
and
the
results
of
his
work
were
soon
observed
order
began
to
reign
where
everything
had
before
been
in
confusion
dirt
was
conquered
by
cleanliness
where
there
had
been
wastefulness
there
was
now
thriftiness
where
there
had
been
neglect
there
was
unremitting
attention
girard
saw
that
every
case
was
properly
attended
to
he
himself
attended
to
the
patients
afflicted
by
the
loathsome
disease
ministered
to
the
dying
and
performed
the
last
kind
offices
for
the
dead
at
last
the
plague
was
stayed
and
girard
and
helm
returned
to
their
ordinary
occupations
the
visitors
of
the
poor
in
philadelphia
placed
the
following
minute
on
their
books
stephen
girard
and
peter
helm
members
of
the
committee
commiserating
the
calamitous
state
to
which
the
sick
may
probably
be
reduced
for
want
of
suitable
persons
to
superintend
the
hospital
voluntarily
offered
their
services
for
that
benevolent
employment
and
excited
a
surprise
and
satisfaction
that
can
be
better
conceived
than
expressed
the
results
of
stephen
girard
industry
and
economy
may
be
seen
in
philadelphia
in
the
beautiful
dwelling
houses
row
after
row
but
more
than
all
in
the
magnificent
marble
edifice
of
girard
college
he
left
the
greater
part
of
his
fortune
for
public
purposes
principally
to
erect
and
maintain
a
public
library
and
a
large
orphanage
it
might
have
been
in
regard
to
his
own
desolate
condition
when
cast
an
orphan
amongst
strangers
and
foreigners
that
he
devised
his
splendid
charity
for
poor
forlorn
and
fatherless
children
one
of
the
rooms
in
the
college
is
singularly
furnished
girard
had
directed
that
a
suitable
room
was
to
be
set
apart
for
the
preservation
of
his
books
and
papers
but
from
excess
of
pious
care
or
dread
of
the
kin
all
the
plain
homely
man
effects
were
shovelled
into
this
room
here
are
his
boxes
and
his
bookcase
his
gig
and
his
gaiters
his
pictures
and
his
pottery
and
in
a
bookcase
hanging
with
careless
grace
are
his
braces
old
homely
knitted
braces
telling
their
tale
of
simplicity

one
of
the
finest
hospitals
in
london
is
that
founded
by
thomas
guy
the
bookseller
he
is
said
to
have
been
a
miser
at
all
events
he
must
have
been
a
thrifty
and
saving
man
no
foundation
such
as
that
of
guy
can
be
accomplished
without
thrift
men
who
accomplish
such
things
must
deny
themselves
for
the
benefit
of
others
thomas
guy
appears
early
to
have
projected
schemes
of
benevolence
he
first
built
and
endowed
almshouses
at
tamworth
for
fourteen
poor
men
and
women
with
pensions
for
each
occupant
and
with
a
thoughtfulness
becoming
his
vocation
he
furnished
them
with
a
library
he
had
himself
been
educated
at
tamworth
where
he
had
doubtless
seen
hungry
and
homeless
persons
suffering
from
cleanness
of
teeth
and
the
winter
rage
and
the
almshouses
were
his
contribution
for
their
relief
he
was
a
bookseller
in
london
at
that
time
guy
prospered
not
so
much
by
bookselling
as
by
buying
and
selling
south
sea
stock
when
the
bubble
burst
he
did
not
hold
a
share
but
he
had
realized
a
profit
of
several
hundred
thousand
pounds
this
sum
he
principally
employed
in
building
and
endowing
the
hospital
which
bears
his
name
the
building
was
roofed
in
before
his
death
in
scotch
benefactors
for
the
most
part
leave
their
savings
for
the
purpose
of
founding
hospitals
for
educational
purposes
there
was
first
the
heriot
hospital
founded
in
edinburgh
by
george
heriot
the
goldsmith
of
james
for
maintaining
and
educating
a
hundred
and
eighty
boys
but
the
property
of
the
hospital
having
increased
in
value
the
new
town
of
edinburgh
being
for
the
most
part
built
on
george
heriot
land
the
operations
of
the
charity
have
been
greatly
extended
as
many
as
four
thousand
boys
and
girls
being
now
educated
free
of
expense
in
different
parts
of
the
city
there
are
also
the
george
watson
hospital
the
john

the
orphan

two
maiden
hospitals
the
cauven
hospital
the
donaldson

the

and
the
splendid
fettes
college
recently
opened
all
founded
by
scottish
benefactors
for
the
ordinary
education
of
boys
and
girls
and
also
for
their
higher
education
edinburgh
may
well
be
called
the
city
of
educational
endowments
there
is
also
the
madras
college
at
andrews
founded
by
the
late
andrew
bell
the
dollar
institution
founded
by
john
macrat
and
the
dick
bequest
for
elevating
the
character
and
position
of
the
parochial
schools
and
schoolmasters
in
the
counties
of
aberdeen
banff
and
moray
the
effects
of
this
last
bequest
have
been
most
salutary
it
has
raised
the
character
of
the
education
given
in
the
public
schools
and
the
results
have
been
frequently
observed
at
cambridge
where
men
from
the
northern
counties
have
taken
high
honours
in
all
departments
of
learning
english
benefactors
have
recently
been
following
in
the
same
direction
the
owen
college
at
manchester
the
brown
library
and
museum
at
liverpool
the
whitworth
benefaction
by
which
thirty
scholarships
of
the
annual
value
of
each
have
been
founded
for
the
promotion
of
technical
instruction
and
the
scientific
college
at
birmingham
founded
by
sir
josiah
mason
for
the
purpose
of
educating
the
rising
generation
in
sound
extensive
and
practical
scientific
knowledge
form
a
series
of
excellent
institutions
which
will
we
hope
be
followed
by
many
similar
benefactions
a
man
need
not
moulder
with
the
green
grass
over
his
grave
before
his
means
are
applied
to
noble
purposes
he
can
make
his
benefactions
while
living
and
assist
at
the
outset
in
carrying
out
his
liberal
intentions
among
the
great
benefactors
of
london
the
name
of
peabody
the
american
banker
can
not
be
forgotten
it
would
take
a
volume
to
discuss
his
merits
though
we
must
dismiss
him
in
a
paragraph
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
see
or
at
all
events
to
make
amends
for
the
houseless
condition
of
the
working
classes
of
london
in
the
formation
of
railways
under
and
above
ground
in
opening
out
and
widening
new
streets
in
erecting
new
public
buildings
the
dwellings
of
the
poor
were
destroyed
and
their
occupants
swarmed
away
no
one
knew
whither
perhaps
they
crowded
closer
together
and
bred
disease
in
many
forms
societies
and
companies
were
formed
to
remedy
the
evil
to
a
certain
extent
sir
sydney
waterlow
was
one
of
the
first
to
lead
the
way
and
he
was
followed
by
others
but
it
was
not
until
peabody
had
left
his
splendid
benefaction
to
the
poor
of
london
that
any
steps
could
be
taken
to
deal
with
the
evil
on
a
large
and
comprehensive
scale
his
trustees
have
already
erected
ranges
of
workmen
dwellings
in
many
parts
of
the
metropolis
which
will
from
time
to
time
be
extended
to
other
parts
the
peabody
dwellings
furnish
an
example
of
what
working
men
dwellings
ought
to
be
they
are
clean
tidy
and
comfortable
homes
they
have
diminished
drunkenness
they
have
promoted
morality
peabody
intended
that
his
bounty
should
directly
ameliorate
the
condition
and
augment
the
comforts
of
the
poor
and
he
hoped
that
the
results
would
be
appreciated
not
only
by
the
present
but
by
future
generations
of
the
people
of
london
from
all
that
the
trustees
have
done
it
is
clear
that
they
are
faithfully
and
nobly
carrying
out
his
intentions
all
these
benefactors
of
the
poor
were
originally
men
of
moderate
means
some
of
them
were
at
one
time
poor
men
sir
joseph
whitworth
was
a
journeyman
engineer
with
clement
in
southwark
the
inventor
of
the
planing
machine
sir
josiah
mason
was
by
turns
a
costermonger
journeyman
baker
shoemaker

weaver
jeweller

maker
here
he
made
his
first
thousand
pounds

and
in
which
last
trade
he
made
his
fortune
mr
peabody
worked
his
way
up
by
small
degrees
from
a
clerk
in
america
to
a
banker
in
london
their
benefactions
have
been
the
result
of
industry
sobriety
and
thrift
benevolence

blossoms
which
do
not
always
ripen
into
fruit
it
is
easy
enough
to
project
a
benevolent
undertaking
but
more
difficult
to
carry
it
out
the
author
was
once
induced
to
take
an
interest
in
a
proposed
navvy
home
but
cold
water
was
thrown
upon
the
project
and
it
failed
the
navvy
workmen
who
have
made
the
railways
and
docks
of
england
are
a
but
a
rather
thriftless
set
they
are
fellows
but
sometimes
drunken
in
carrying
out
their
operations
they
often
run
great
dangers
they
are
sometimes
so
seriously
injured
by
wounds
and
fractures
as
to
be
disabled
for
life
for
instance
in
carrying
out
the
works
of
the
manchester
sheffield
and
lincolnshire
railway
there
were
cases
of
compound
fractures
simple
fractures
besides
burns
from
blasts
severe
contusions
lacerations
and
dislocations
one
man
lost
both
his
eyes
by
a
blast
another
had
his
arm
broken
by
a
blast
many
lost
their
fingers
feet
legs
and
arms
which
disabled
them
for
further
work
knowing
the
perils
to
which
railway
labourers
were
exposed
it
occurred
to
a
late
eminent
contractor
to
adopt
some
method
for
helping
and
comforting
them
in
their
declining
years
the
subject
was
brought
under
the
author
notice
by
his
friend
the
late
eborall
in
the
following
words
i
have
just
been
visiting
a
large
contractor
a
man
of
great
wealth
and
he
requests
your
assistance
in
establishing
a
home
you
know
that
many
of
the
contractors
and
engineers
who
have
been
engaged
in
the
construction
of
railways
are
men
who
have
accumulated
immense
fortunes
the
savings
of
some
of
them
amount
to
millions
well
my
friend
the
contractor
not
long
since
found
a
miserable
old
man
in
a
ditch
by
the
roadside
said
he
that
you
naming
the
man
in
the
ditch
by
his
name
replied
the
man
it
is
are
you
doing
there
have
come
here
to
die
i
can
work
no
more
do
you
go
to
the
workhouse
they
will
attend
to
your
wants
there
no
workhouse
for
me
if
i
am
to
die
i
will
die
in
the
open
air
the
contractor
recognized
in
the
man
one
of
his
former
navvies
he
had
worked
for
him
and
for
other
contractors
many
years
and
while
they
had
been
making
their
fortunes
the
navvy
who
had
worked
for
them
had
fallen
so
low
as
to
be
found
dying
in
a
ditch
the
contractor
was
much
affected
he
thought
of
the
numerous
other
navvies
who
must
be
wanting
similar
help
shortly
after
he
took
ill
and
during
his
illness
thinking
of
what
he
might
do
for
the
navvies
the
idea
occurred
to
him
of
founding
a
home
and
he
has
desired
me
to
ask
you
to
assist
him
in
bringing
out
the
institution
it
seemed
to
the
author
an
admirable
project
and
he
consented
to
do
all
that
he
could
for
it
but
when
the
persons
who
were
the
most
likely
to
contribute
to
such
an
institution
were
applied
to
they
threw
such
floods
of
cold
water
upon
it
that
it
became
evident
in
the
face
of
their
opposition
that
the
navvy
home
could
not
be
established
of
course
excuses
were
abundant
navvies
were
the
most
extravagant
workmen
they
threw
away
everything
that
they
earned
they
spent
their
money
on
beer
whisky
and
champagne
if
they
died
in
ditches
it
was
their
own
fault
they
might
have
established
themselves
in
comfort
if
they
wished
to
do
so
why
should
other
people
provide
for
them
in
old
age
more
than
for
any
other
class
of
labourers
there
was
the
workhouse
let
them
go
there
and
so
on
it
is
easy
to
find
a
stick
to
beat
a
sick
dog
as
for
the
original
projector
he
recovered
his
health
he
forgot
to
subscribe
for
the
navvy
home
and
the
scheme
fell
to
the
ground
the
devil
was
sick
the
devil
a
saint
would
be
the
devil
grew
well
the
devil
a
saint
was
he
footnote
with
one
admirable
exception
a
man
still
living
volunteered
a
very
large
subscription

some

it
is

warns
us
to
amend
our

of

it
virtually
says
return
to
nature
observe
her
laws
and
be
restored
to
happiness
thus
paradoxical
though
it
may
seem
pain
is
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
physical
of
man
as
death
according
to
thomas
brown
is
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
enjoyment
of
life
to
enjoy
physical
happiness
therefore
the
natural
laws
must
be
complied
with
to
discover
and
observe
these
laws
man

with
the
gift
of

does
he
fail
to
exercise
this
gift
does
he
neglect
to
comply
with
the
law
of
his
being
then
pain
and
disease
are
the
necessary
consequence
man
violates
the
laws
of
nature
in
his
own
person
and
he
suffers
accordingly
he
is
idle
and
overfeeds
himself
he
is
punished
by
gout
indigestion
or
apoplexy
he
drinks
too
much
he
becomes
bloated
trembling
and
weak
his
appetite
falls
off
his
strength
declines
his
constitution
decays
and
he
falls
a
victim
to
the
numerous
diseases
which

before

the
misery
and

incurred
in
such
cases
are
nothing
less
than
wilful
inasmuch
as
the

to
avert
them
is
within
the

of

wherever
any

the

principally
the

of

whatever

poison
to
the

if
introduced
again
through

hence
the
immense
importance
of
pure
air
a
deficiency
of
food
may
be
considerably
less
injurious
than
a
deficiency
of
pure

every

about
six

to

if

in

he

gradually
approach
the

footnote
where
six

the

five

the

about

humboldt
tells
of
a

who
was
dying
of

in

close
hold
of

his

brought
him
out
of
his

die
in

instead
of
dying
he
revived
and
eventually
got
well
he
was
cured
by
the
pure

the
most
common
result
of
breathing
impure
air
amongst

fever

of
opinion
that

inflicted
on

from

and

amounts
to
not
less
than
five

but
this
is
only
the
physical

pecuniary
loss
the
moral
loss
is
infinitely
greater
where

that

imaginations
of

before
the
age
of

and
sanitary
reformers
the
pastoral
life
of
the
arcadians
was
a
beautiful
myth
the
blue

men
have
exploded
it
for
ever
the
agricultural
labourers
have
not
decent
houses
only
miserable
huts
to
live
in
they
have
but
few
provisions
for
cleanliness
or

for

all
that
the

can
afford

to
the

contains
the
cooking
utensils
the

apparatus
agricultural
implements
and
dirty
clothes
in
the

apartment
the
parents
and
their
children
boys
and
girls
are
indiscriminately
mixed
and
frequently
a
lodger
sleeps
in
the
same
and
only
room
which
has
generally
no
window
the
openings
in
the
roof
admitting
light
and
exposing
the
family
to
every
vicissitude
of
the
weather
the
husband
having
no
comfort
at

seeks
it
in
the
beershop
the
children
grow
up
without
decency
or
as
for
the
wives
and
daughters
their
lot
is
very
miserable
it
is
not
often

affairs
are
made
the
subject
of
discussion
in
newspapers
for
the
power
of
the
press
has
not
yet
reached
remote
country
places
but
we
do
hear
occasionally
of
whole
villages
being
pulled
down
and
razed
in
order
to
prevent
them
becoming
nests
of
beggars
brats
a
member
of
parliament
did
not
hesitate
to
confess
before
a
parliamentary
committee
that
he
had
pulled
down
between
and
thirty
cottages
which
had
they
been
left
standing
would
have
been
inhabited
by
young
married
couples
and
what
becomes
of
the
dispossessed
they
crowd
together
in
the
cottages
which
are
left
standing
if
their
owners
will
allow
it
or
they
crowd
into
the
workhouses
or
more
generally
they
crowd
into
the
towns
where
there
is
at
least
some
hope
of
employment
for
themselves
and
their
children
our
manufacturing
towns
are
not
at
all
what
they
ought
to
be
not
sufficiently
pure
wholesome
or
but
the
rural
labourers
regard
even
the
misery
of
towns
as
preferable
to
the
worse
misery
of
the
rural
districts
and
year
by
year
they
crowd
into
the
seats
of
manufacturing
industry
in
search
of
homes
and
employment
this
speaks
volumes
as
to
the
actual
state
of
our
boasted
peasantry
their
country
pride
the
intellectual
condition
of
the
country
labourers
seems
to
be
on
a
par
with
their
physical
state
those
in
the
western
counties
are
as
little
civilized
as
the
poor
people
in
the
east
of
london
a
report
of
the
diocesan
board
of
the
county
of
hereford
states
that
a
great
deal
of
the
superstition
of
past
ages
lingers
in
our
parishes
the
observation
of
lucky
and
unlucky
days
and
seasons
is
by
no
means
unusual
the
phases
of
the
moon
are
regarded
with
great
respect
in
one
medicine
may
be
taken
in
another
it
is
advisable
to
kill
a
pig
over
the
doors
of
many

be
found

placed
crosswise
and
never
suffered
to

a
charms

devoutly
believed
in
a

made
from

an
undoubted
cure
for

hair
plucked
from
the
crop
on
an
ass
shoulder
and
woven
into
a
chain
to
be
put
round
a

neck
is
powerful
for
the
same
purpose
and
the
hand
of
a
corpse
applied
to
the
neck
is
believed
to
disperse
a
wen
the
eye
so
long
dreaded
in
uneducated
countries
has
its
terrors
among
us
and
if
a
person
of
ill
life
be
suddenly
called
away
there
are
generally
some
who
hear
his
or
see
his
ghost
there
exists
besides
the
custom
of
communicating
deaths
to
hives
of
bees
in
the
belief
that
they
invariably
abandon
their
owners
if
the
intelligence
be
withheld
sydney
smith
has
said
with
more
truth
than
elegance
that
in
the
infancy
of
all
nations
even
the
most
civilized
men
lived
the
life
of
pigs
and
if
sanitary
reporters
had
existed
in
times
past
as
they
do
now
we
should
doubtless
have
received
an
account
of
the
actual
existence
and
domestic
accommodation
of
the
old
english
swains
and
shepherds
very
different
from
that
given
by
phineas
fletcher
even
the
mechanics
of
this
day
are
more
comfortably
lodged
than
the
great
landed
gentry
of
the
saxon
and
norman
periods
and
if
the
truth
could
be
got
at
it
would
be
found
that
bad
as
is
the
state
of
our
agricultural
labourers
now
the
condition
of
their
forefathers
was
no
better
the
first
method
of
raising
a
man
above
the
life
of
an
animal
is
to
provide
him
with
a
healthy
home
the
home
is
after
all
the
best
school
for
the
world
children
grow
up
into
men
and
women
there
they
imbibe
their
best
and
their
worst
morality
there
and
their
morals
and
intelligence
are
in
a
great
measure
well
or
ill
trained
there
men
can
only
be
really
and
truly
humanized
and
civilized
through
the
institution
of
the
home
there
is
domestic
purity
and
moral
life
in
the
good
home
and
individual
defilement
and
moral
death
in
the
bad
one
the
schoolmaster
has
really
very
little
to
do
with
the
formation
of
the
characters
of
children
these
are
formed
in
the
home
by
the
father
and
mother
by
brothers
sisters
and
companions
it
does
not
matter
how
complete
may
be
the
education
given
in
schools
it
may
include
the
whole
range
of
knowledge
yet
if
the
scholar
is
under
the
necessity
of
daily
returning
to
a
home
which
is
indecent
vicious
and
miserable
all
this
learning
will
prove
of
comparatively
little
value
character
and
disposition
are
the
result
of
home
training
and
if
these
are
through
bad
physical
and
moral
conditions
deteriorated
and
destroyed
the
intellectual
culture
acquired
in
the
school
may
prove
an
instrumentality
for
evil
rather
than
for
good
the
home
should
not
be
considered
merely
as
an
eating
and
sleeping
place
but
as
a
place
where
may
be
preserved
and
comfort
secured
and
domestic
pleasures
enjoyed
of
the
petty
vices
which
degrade
society
and
swell
into
crimes
which
disgrace
it
would
shrink
before
the
influence
of
to
be
a
place
of
happiness
exercising
beneficial
influences
upon
its
members
and
especially
upon
the
children
growing
up
within
it
the
home
must
be
pervaded
by
the
spirit
of
comfort
cleanliness
affection
and
intelligence
and
in
order
to
secure
this
the
presence
of
a
industrious
and
educated
woman
is
indispensable
so
much
depends
upon
the
woman
that
we
might
almost
pronounce
the
happiness
or
unhappiness
of
the
home
to
be
woman
work
no
nation
can
advance
except
through
the
improvement
of
the
nation
homes
and
these
can
only
be
improved
through
the
instrumentality
of
women
they
must
how
to
make
homes
comfortable
and
before
they
can
know
they
must
have
been
taught
women
must
therefore
have
sufficient
training
to
fit
them
for
their
duties
in
real
life
their
education
should
be
conducted
throughout
with
a
view
to
their
future
position
as
wives
mothers
and
housewives
but
amongst
all
classes
even
the
highest
the
education
of
girls
is
rarely
conducted
with
this
object
amongst
the
working
people
the
girls
are
sent
out
to
work
amongst
the
higher
classes
they
are
sent
out
to
learn
a
few
flashy
accomplishments
and
men
are
left
to
pick
from
them
very
often
with
little
judgment
the
future
wives
and
mothers
of
england
men
themselves
attach
little
or
no
importance
to
the
intelligence
or
industrial
skill
of
women
and
they
only
discover
their
value
when
they
find
their
homes
stupid
and
cheerless
men
are
caught
by
the
glance
of
a
bright
eye
by
a
pair
of
cherry
cheeks
by
a
handsome
figure
and
when
they
fall
in
love
as
the
phrase
goes
they
never
bethink
them
of
whether
the
loved
one
can
mend
a
shirt
or
cook
a
pudding
and
yet
the
most
sentimental
of
husbands
must
come
down
from
his
ecstatics
so
soon
as
the
knot
is
tied
and
then
he
soon
enough
finds
out
that
the
clever
hands
of
a
woman
are
worth
far
more
than
her
bright
glances
and
if
the
shirt
and
pudding
qualifications
be
absent
then
woe
to
the
unhappy
man
and
woe
also
to
the
unhappy
woman
if
the
substantial
element
of
physical
comfort
be
absent
from
the
home
it
soon
becomes
hateful
the
wife
notwithstanding
all
her
good
looks
is
neglected
and
the
separates
those
whom
the
law
and
the
church
have
joined
together
men
are
really
desperately
ignorant
respecting
the
home
department
if
they
thought
for
a
moment
of
its
importance
they
would
not
be
so
ready
to
rush
into
premature
housekeeping
ignorant
men
select
equally
ignorant
women
for
their
wives
and
these
introduce
into
the
world
families
of
children
whom
they
are
utterly
incompetent
to
train
as
rational
or
domestic
beings
the
home
is
no
home
but
a
mere
lodging
and
often
a
very
comfortless
one
we
speak
not
merely
of
the
poorest
labourers
but
of
the
workmen
in
the
large
manufacturing
towns
men
earning
from
two
to
three
pounds
a
week
or
more
than
the
average
pay
of
curates
and
clerks
though
spending
considerable
amounts
on
beer
will
often
grudge
so
small
a
part
of
their
income
as
a
week
to
provide
decent
homes
for
themselves
and
their
children
what
is
the
consequence
they
degrade
themselves
and
their
families
they
crowd
together
in
foul
neighbourhoods
into
dwellings
possessing
no
element
of
health
or
decency
where
even
the
small
rental
which
they
pay
is
in
excess
of
the
accommodation
they
receive
the
results
are
inevitable
loss
of
degradation
of
intelligence
failure
of
physical
health
and
premature
death
even
the
philosopher
placed
in
such
a
situation
would
gradually
gravitate
towards
brutality
but
the
amount
thus
saved
or
rather
not
expended
on
is
not
economy
it
is
reckless
waste
the
sickness
caused
by
the
bad
dwelling
involves
frequent
interruptions
of
work
and
drains
upon
the
savings
bank
or
the
benefit
society
and
a
final
and
rapid
descent
to
the
though
the
loss
to
the
middle
and
upper
classes
is
great
the
loss
is
not
for
a
moment
to
be
compared
with
that
which
falls
upon
the
working
classes
themselves
through
their
neglect
in
providing
wholesome
and
comfortable
dwellings
for
their
families
it
is
perhaps
not
saying
too
much
to
aver
that
the
money
expended
by
benefit
societies
in
large
towns
may
be
set
down
as
pecuniary
loss
arising
from
bad
and
unhealthy
homes
but
there
is
a
worse
consequence
still
the
low
tone
of
physical
health
thereby
produced
is
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
drunkenness
chadwick
once
remonstrated
with
an
apparently
sensible
workman
on
the
expenditure
of
half
his
income
on
whisky
his
reply
was
do
you
sir
come
and
live
here
and
you
will
drink
whisky
too
leigh
says
i
would
not
be
understood
that
habits
of
intoxication
are
due
to
a
defective
sanitary
condition
but
no
person
can
have
the
experience
i
have
had
without
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
and
unhappy
homes
loss
of
and
consequently
of
energy
and
a
consciousness
of
inability
to
control
external
circumstances
induce
thousands
to
escape
from
miserable
depression
in
the
temporary
excitement
of
noxious
drugs
and
intoxicating
liquors
they
are
like
the
seamen
who
struggle
for
awhile
against
the
evils
by
which
they
are
surrounded
but
at
last
seeing
no
hope
stupefy
themselves
with
drink
and
perish
it
may
be
said
in
excuse
that
working
people
must
necessarily
occupy
such
houses
as
are
to
be
had
and
pay
the
rental
asked
for
them
bad
and
unwholesome
though
they
be
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
supply
and
demand
and
the
dwellings
now
supplied
are
really
those
which
are
most
in
demand
because
of
their
lowness
of
rental
were
the
working
classes
to
shun
unwholesome
districts
and
dwellings
and
rent
only
such
tenements
as
were
calculated
to
fulfil
the
requirements
of
a
wholesome
and
cleanly
home
the
owners
of
property
would
be
compelled
to
improve
the
character
of
their
houses
and
raise
them
to
the
required
standard
of
comfort
and
accommodation
the
real
remedy
must
lie
with
the
working
classes
themselves
let
them
determine
to
raise
their
standard
of
rental
and
the
reform
is
in
a
great
measure
accomplished
we
have
already
shown
how
masters
have
done
a
great
deal
for
the
better
accommodation
of
their
how
the
benefactors
of
the
poor
such
as
peabody
and
lady
burdett
coutts
have
promoted
the
building
of
healthy
homes
yet
the
result
must
depend
upon
the
individual
action
of
the
working
classes
themselves
when
they
have
the
choice
of
living
in
a
dwelling
situated
in
a
healthy
locality
and
of
another
situated
in
an
unhealthy
locality
they
ought
to
choose
the
former
but
very
often
they
do
not
there
is
perhaps
a
difference
of
sixpence
a
week
in
the
rental
and
not
knowing
the
advantages
of
health
they
take
the
unhealthy
dwelling
because
it
is
the
cheapest
but
the
money
that
sickly
people
have
to
pay
for
physic
doctors
bills
and
loss
of
wages
far
more
than
exceeds
the
amount
saved
by
cheaper
rental
not
to
speak
of
the
loss
of
comfort
the
want
of
cleanliness
and
the
depression
of
spirits
which
is
inevitable
where
foul
air
is
breathed
to
build
a
wholesome
dwelling
costs
little
more
than
to
build
an
unwholesome
one
what
is
wanted
on
the
part
of
the
builder
is
a
knowledge
of
sanitary
conditions
and
a
willingness
to
provide
the
proper
accommodation
the
space
of
ground
covered
by
the
dwelling
is
the
same
in
both
cases
the
quantity
of
bricks
and
mortar
need
be
no
greater
and
pure
air
is
of
the
same
price
as
foul
air
light
costs
nothing
a
healthy
home
presided
over
by
a
thrifty
cleanly
woman
may
be
the
abode
of
comfort
of
virtue
and
of
happiness
it
may
be
the
scene
of
every
ennobling
relation
in
family
life
it
may
be
endeared
to
a
man
by
many
delightful
memories
by
the
affectionate
voices
of
his
wife
his
children
and
his
neighbours
such
a
home
will
be
regarded
not
as
a
mere
nest
of
common
instinct
but
as
a
for
young
immortals
a
sanctuary
for
the
heart
a
refuge
from
storms
a
sweet
after
labour
a
consolation
in
sorrow
a
pride
in
success
and
a
joy
at
all
times
much
has
been
done
to
spread
the
doctrines
of
sanitary
science
there
is
no
mystery
attached
to
it
otherwise
we
should
have
had
professors
teaching
it
in
colleges
as
we
have
now
and
graduates
practising
it
amongst
the
people
it
is
only
of
recent
years
that
it
has
received
general
recognition
and
we
owe
it
not
to
the
medical
faculty
but
to
a
barrister
that
it
has
become
embodied
in
many
important
acts
of
parliament
edwin
chadwick
has
not
yet
received
ordinary
justice
from
his
contemporaries
though
he
has
been
one
of
the
most
indefatigable
and
successful
workers
of
the
age
and
has
greatly
influenced
the
legislation
of
his
time
he
is
probably
less
known
than
many
a
parliamentary
talker
chadwick
belongs
to
a
lancashire
family
and
was
born
near
manchester
he
received
his
education
chiefly
in
london
having
chosen
the
law
for
his
profession
he
was
enrolled
a
student
of
the
inner
temple
in
his
year
there
he
ate
his
way
to
the
bar
maintaining
himself
by
reporting
and
writing
for
the
daily
press
he
was
not
a
man
of
an
extraordinary
amount
of
learning
but
he
was
a
sagacious
and
persevering
man
he
was
ready
to
confront
any
amount
of
labour
in
prosecuting
an
object
no
matter
how
remote
its
attainment
might
at
first
sight
appear
to
be
at
an
early
period
in
his
career
edwin
chadwick
became
possessed
by
an
idea
it
is
a
great
thing
to
be
thoroughly
possessed
by
an
idea
provided
its
aim
and
end
be
beneficent
it
gives
a
colour
and
bias
to
the
whole
of
a
man
life
the
idea
was
not
a
new
one
but
being
taken
up
by
an
earnest
energetic
and
man
there
was
some
hope
for
the
practical
working
out
of
his
idea
in
the
actual
life
of
humanity
it
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
sanitary
idea
the
germ
of
the
sanitary
movement
we
must
now
briefly
state
how
he
worked
his
way
to
its
practical
realization
it
appears
that
morgan
the
government
actuary
had
stated
before
a
parliamentary
committee
that
though
the
circumstances
of
the
middle
classes
had
improved
their
expectation
of
life
had
not
lengthened
this
being
diametrically
opposed
to
our
student
idea
he
endeavoured
to
demonstrate
the
fallacy
of
the
actuary
opinion
he
read
up
and
sifted
numerous
statistical
documents
blue
books
and
he
bored
his
way
through
the
cumbrous
pile
and
brought
an
accumulation
of
facts
from
the
most
quarters
for
the
purpose
of
illustrating
his
idea
and
elucidating
his
the
result
was
published
in
the
for
april
chadwick
demonstrated
by
an
immense
array
of
facts
and
arguments
that
the
circumstances
which
surround
human
beings
have
an
influence
upon
their
health
that
health
improve
with
an
improvement
of
these
circumstances
that
many
of
the
diseases
and
conditions
unfavourable
to
human
life
were
under
man
control
and
capable
of
being
removed
that
the
practice
of
vaccination
the
diminution
of
hard
drinking
amongst
the
middle
and
upper
classes
the
increase
of
habits
of
cleanliness
the
improvements
in
medical
science
and
the
better
construction
of
streets
and
houses
according
to
all
medical
and
popular
experience
have
contributed
to
lengthen
life
and
these
he
proved
by
a
citation
of
facts
from
numerous
authentic
sources
in
short
morgan
was
wrong
the
expectancy
of
life
as
is
now
universally
admitted
has
improved
and
is
rapidly
improving
amongst
the
better
classes
but
it
was
never
thoroughly
demonstrated
until
edwin
chadwick
undertook
the
discussion
of
the
question
another
article
which
chadwick
published
in
the
in
on
preventive
police
was
read
by
jeremy
bentham
then
in
his
year
who
so
much
admired
it
that
he
craved
an
introduction
to
the
writer
the
consequence
was
the
formation
of
a
friendship
that
lasted
without
interruption
until
the
death
of
the
philosopher
in
bentham
wished
to
engage
the
whole
of
his
young
friend
time
in
assisting
him
with
the
preparation
of
his
administrative
code
and
he
offered
to
place
him
in
independent
circumstances
if
he
would
devote
himself
exclusively
to
the
advancement
of
his
views
the
offer
was
however
declined
chadwick
completed
his
law
studies
and
was
called
to
the
bar
in
november
he
was
preparing
to
enter
upon
the
practice
of
common
law
occasionally
contributing
articles
to
the
when
he
was
in
appointed
a
commissioner
in
conjunction
with
southwood
smith
and
tooke
to
investigate
the
question
of
factory
labour
which
lord
ashley
and
sadler
were
at
that
time
strongly
pressing
upon
public
attention
the
sanitary
idea
again
found
opportunity
for
expression
in
the
report
of
the
commission
which
referred
to
defective
drainage
ventilation
water
supply
and
the
like
as
causes
of
disease
acting
concurrently
with
excessive
toil
to
depress
the
health
and
shorten
the
lives
of
the
factory
population
in
the
same
year
an
important
commission
of
inquiry
was
appointed
by
lord
grey
government
in
reference
to
the
operation
of
the
poor
laws
in
england
and
wales
chadwick
was
appointed
one
of
the
assistant
commissioners
for
the
purpose
of
taking
evidence
on
the
subject
and
the
districts
of
london
and
berkshire
were
allotted
to
him
his
report
published
in
the
following
year
was
a
model
of
what
a
report
should
be
it
was
full
of
information
admirably
classified
and
arranged
and
was
so
racy
by
virtue
of
the
facts
brought
to
light
and
the
care
taken
to
preserve
the
very
words
of
the
witnesses
as
they
were
spoken
that
the
report
may
be
read
with
interest
by
the
most
inveterate
enemy
of
chadwick
showed
himself
so
thoroughly
a
master
of
the
subject
his
suggestions
were
so
full
of
practical
value
that
he
was
shortly
after
the
publication
of
the
report
advanced
from
the
post
of
assistant
commissioner
to
that
of
chief
commissioner
and
he
largely
shared
with
senior
in
the
labours
and
honours
of
the
commissioners
report
submitted
to
the
house
of
commons
in
and
also
in
the
famous
amendment
act
passed
in
the
same
year
in
which
the
recommendations
of
the
commissioners
were
substantially
adopted
and
formalized
one
may
venture
to
say
now
without
fear
of
contradiction
that
that
law
was
one
of
the
most
valuable
that
has
been
placed
on
the
in
modern
times
and
yet
no
law
proved
more
unpopular
than
this
was
for
years
after
it
had
been
enacted
but
chadwick
never
ceased
to
have
perfect
faith
in
the
soundness
of
the
principles
on
which
it
was
based
and
he
was
indefatigable
in
defending
and
establishing
it
it
has
been
well
said
that
to
become
popular
is
an
easy
thing
but
to
do
unpopular
justice
that
requires
a
man
and
edwin
chadwick
is
the
man
who
has
never
failed
in
courage
to
do
the
right
thing
even
though
it
should
prove
to
be
the
unpopular
thing
whilst
burrowing
amidst
the
voluminous
evidence
on
the
poor
laws
chadwick
never
lost
sight
of
his
sanitary
idea
all
his
reports
were
strongly
imbued
with
it
of
the
then
existing
pauperism
was
traced
by
him
to
the
preventible
causes
of
disease
his
minute
investigations
into
the
condition
of
the
labouring
population
and
of
the
poorer
classes
generally
gave
him
a
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
physical
evils
that
were
preying
upon
the
community
carrying
them
off
by
fevers
consumption
and
cholera
and
the
sanitary
idea
took
still
firmer
possession
of
his
mind
one
day
in
while
engaged
in
his
official
vocation
of
secretary
to
the
commission
an
officer
of
the
whitechapel
union
hastily
entered
the
of
the
commission
and
with
a
troubled
countenance
informed
the
secretary
that
a
terrible
fever
had
broken
out
round
a
stagnant
pool
in
whitechapel
that
the
people
were
dying
by
scores
and
that
the
extreme
malignity
of
the
cases
gave
reason
to
apprehend
that
the
disease
was
allied
to
asiatic
cholera
on
hearing
this
the
board
at
chadwick
instance
immediately
appointed
drs
arnott
kay
and
southwood
smith
to
investigate
the
causes
of
this
alarming
mortality
and
to
report
generally
upon
the
sanitary
condition
of
london
this
inquiry
at
length
ripened
into
the
sanitary
inquiry
in
the
meantime
chadwick
had
been
engaged
as
a
member
of
the
commission
to
inquire
as
to
the
best
means
of
establishing
an
efficient
constabulary
force
in
england
and
wales
the
evidence
was
embodied
in
a
report
as
interesting
as
a
novel
of
dickens
which
afforded
a
curious
insight
into
the
modes
of
living
the
customs
and
habits
of
the
lowest
classes
of
the
population
when
this
question
had
been
dismissed
chadwick
proceeded
to
devote
himself
almost
exclusively
to
the
great
work
of
his
life
the
sanitary
movement
the
bishop
of
london
in
moved
in
the
lords
that
the
inquiry
which
had
been
made
at
chadwick
instance
by
drs
southwood
smith
arnott
and
kay
into
the
sanitary
state
of
the
metropolis
should
be
extended
to
the
whole
population
city
rural
and
manufacturing
of
england
and
wales
some
residents
in
edinburgh
also
petitioned
that
scotland
might
be
included
and
accordingly
in
august
lord
john
russell
addressed
a
letter
to
the
board
authorizing
them
by
royal
command
to
extend
to
the
whole
of
great
britain
the
inquiry
into
preventible
disease
which
had
already
been
begun
with
regard
to
the
metropolis
the
onerous
task
of
setting
on
foot
and
superintending
the
inquiry
throughout
of
sifting
the
evidence
and
classifying
and
condensing
it
for
the
purposes
of
publication
devolved
upon
chadwick
the
first
report
on
the
health
of
towns
was
ready
for
publication
in
it
to
have
appeared
as
the
official
report
of
the
board
but
as
the
commissioners
some
of
whom
were
at
variance
with
chadwick
with
respect
to
the
new
refused
to
assume
the
responsibility
of
a
document
that
contained
much
that
must
necessarily
offend
many
influential
public
bodies
chadwick
took
the
responsibility
upon
himself
and
it
was
published
as
report
which
indeed
it
was
and
accepted
from
him
as
such
by
the
commissioners
the
amount
of
dry
hard
work
encountered
by
chadwick
in
the
preparation
of
this
and
his
other
reports
can
scarcely
be
estimated
except
by
those
who
know
anything
of
the
labour
involved
in
extracting
from
masses
of
evidence
written
and
printed
sent
in
from
all
parts
of
the
empire
only
the
most
striking
results
bearing
upon
the
question
in
hand
and
such
as
are
deemed
worthy
of
publication
the
mountains
of
paper
which
chadwick
has
thus
bored
through
in
his
lifetime
must
have
been
immense
and
could
they
now
be
presented
before
him
in
one
pile
they
would
appal
even
stout
heart
the
sensation
excited
throughout
the
country
by
the
publication
of
chadwick
sanitary
report
was
immense
such
a
revelation
of
the
horrors
lying
concealed
beneath
the
fair
surface
of
our
modern
civilization
had
never
before
been
published
but
chadwick
had
no
idea
of
merely
creating
a
sensation
he
had
an
object
in
view
which
he
persistently
pursued
the
report
was
nothing
unless
its
recommendations
were
speedily
carried
into
effect
a
sanitary
party
was
formed
and
the
ministers
for
the
time
being
aided
by
members
of
both
sides
in
politics
became
its
influential
leaders
a
sanitary
commission
was
appointed
in
to
consider
the
whole
question
in
its
practical
bearings
the
commission
published
two
reports
with
a
view
to
legislation
but
the
struggle
interfered
and
little
was
done
for
several
years
meanwhile
our
sanitary
reformer
was
occupied
as
a
commissioner
in
inquiring
into
the
condition
of
the
metropolis
the
commission
published
three
reports
in
which
the
defective
drainage
sewage
and
of
london
were
discussed
in
detail
and
these
have
recently
been
followed
by
important
acts
of
legislation
the
sanitary
idea
at
length
had
its
triumph
in
the
enactment
of
the
public
health
act
of
and
the
appointment
of
a
general
board
of
health
of
which
chadwick
was
a
member
to
superintend
its
administration
numerous
supplemental
measures
have
since
been
enacted
with
the
view
of
carrying
into
practical
effect
the
sanitary
principles
adopted
by
the
board
reports
continued
to
be
published
from
time
to
time
full
of
valuable
information
for
instance
in
reference
to
the
application
of
sewage
water
to
agricultural
purposes
on
epidemic
cholera
on
quarantine
on
drainage
on
public
and
the
like
the
sanitary
movement
in
short
became
a
great
fact
and
that
it
is
so
we
have
mainly
to
thank
edwin
chadwick
the
missionary
of
the
sanitary
idea
it
is
true
he
was
eventually
dismissed
from
his
position
of
influence
at
the
board
of
health
partly
through
spleen
but
chiefly
because
of
his
own
unaccommodating
nature
unaccommodating
especially
to
petty
local
authorities
and
individual
interests
opposed
to
the
public
good
but
with
all
thinking
and
impartial
men
his
character
stands
as
high
as
it
ever
did
at
all
events
his
remain
we
do
not
know
a
more
striking
instance
than
that
presented
by
this
gentleman
career
of
the
large
amount
of
good
which
a
man
strongly
possessed
by
a
beneficent
idea
can
accomplish
provided
he
have
only
the
force
of
purpose
and
perseverance
to
follow
it
up
though
chadwick
has
not
been
an
actual
legislator
he
has
nevertheless
been
the
mover
of
more
wise
measures
than
any
legislator
of
our
time
he
created
a
public
opinion
in
favour
of
sanitary
reform
he
has
also
impressed
the
minds
of
benevolent
individuals
with
the
necessity
for
providing
improved
dwellings
for
the
people
and
has
thus
been
the
indirect
means
of
establishing
the
peabody
dwellings
the
baroness
coutts
dwellings
and
the
various
societies
for
erecting
improved
dwellings
for
the
industrial
classes
edwin
chadwick
has
thus
proved
himself
to
be
one
of
the
most
useful
and
practical
of
public
benefactors
he
deserves
to
be
ranked
with
clarkson
or
howard
his
labours
have
been
equally
salutary
some
will
say
that
they
have
been
much
more
so
in
their
results
sanitary
science
may
be
summed
up
in
the
one
word
cleanliness
pure
water
and
pure
air
are
its
essentials
wherever
there
is
impurity
it
must
be
washed
away
and
got
rid
of
thus
sanitary
science
is
one
of
the
simplest
and
most
intelligible
of
all
the
branches
of
human
knowledge
perhaps
it
is
because
of
this
that
like
most
common
things
it
has
continued
to
receive
so
little
attention
many
still
think
that
it
requires
no
science
at
all
to
ventilate
a
chamber
to
clean
out
a
drain
and
to
keep
house
and
person
free
from
uncleanness
sanitary
science
may
be
regarded
as
an
unsavoury
subject
it
deals
with
dirt
and
its
expulsion
from
the
skin
from
the
house
from
the
street
from
the
city
it
is
comprised
in
the
words
wherever
there
is
dirt
get
rid
of
it
instantly
and
with
cleanliness
let
there
be
a
copious
supply
of
pure
water
and
of
pure
air
for
the
purposes
of
human
health
take
for
instance
an
unhealthy
street
or
block
of
streets
in
a
large
town
there
you
find
typhus
fever
constantly
present
cleanse
and
sewer
the
street
supply
it
with
pure
air
and
pure
water
and
fever
is
forthwith
banished
is
not
this
a
much
more
satisfactory
result
than
the
application
of
drugs
fifty
thousand
persons
says
lee
annually
fall
victims
to
typhus
fever
in
great
britain
originated
by
causes
which
are
preventible
the
result
is
the
same
as
if
these
fifty
thousand
persons
were
annually
taken
out
of
their
wretched
dwellings
and
put
to
death
we
are
shocked
by
the
news
of
a
murder
by
the
loss
of
a
single
life
by
physical
causes
and
yet
we
hear
almost
without
a
shudder
the
reiterated
statement
of
the
loss
of
tens
of
thousands
of
lives
yearly
from
physical
causes
in
daily
operation
the
annual
slaughter
from
preventible
causes
of
typhus
fever
is
double
the
amount
of
what
was
suffered
by
the
allied
armies
at
the
battle
of
waterloo
by
neglect
of
the
ascertained
conditions
of
healthful
living
the
great
mass
of
the
people
lose
nearly
half
the
natural
period
of
their
lives
typhus
says
a
medical
officer
is
a
curse
which
man
inflicts
upon
himself
by
the
neglect
of
sanitary
arrangements
chadwick
affirmed
that
in
the
cellars
of
liverpool
manchester
and
leeds
he
had
seen
amongst
the
operatives
more
vice
misery
and
degradation
than
those
which
when
detailed
by
howard
had
excited
the
sympathy
of
the
world
the
irish
poor
sink
into
the
unhealthy
closes
lanes
and
back
streets
of
large
towns
and
so
frequent
are
the
attacks
of
typhus
among
them
that
in
some
parts
of
the
country
the
disease
is
known
as
the
irish
fever
it
is
not
merely
the
loss
of
life
that
is
so
frightful
there
is
also
the
moral
death
that
is
still
more
appalling
in
these
unhealthy
localities
vice
and
crime
consort
with
foul
living
in
these
places
demoralization
is
the
normal
state
there
is
an
absence
of
cleanliness
of
decency
of
decorum
the
language
used
is
polluting
and
scenes
of
profligacy
are
of
almost
hourly
occurrence
all
tending
to
foster
idleness
drunkenness
and
vicious
abandonment
imagine
such
a
moral
atmosphere
for
women
and
children
the
connection
is
close
and
intimate
between
physical
and
moral
health
between
domestic
and
public
happiness
the
destructive
influence
of
an
unwholesome
dwelling
propagates
a
moral
typhus
worse
than
the
plague
itself
where
the
body
is
enfeebled
by
the
depressing
influences
of
vitiated
air
and
bodily
defilement
the
mind
almost
of
necessity
takes
the
same
low
unhealthy
tone
is
lost
a
stupid
inert
languid
feeling
overpowers
the
system
the
character
becomes
depraved
and
too
often
eager
to
snatch
even
a
momentary
enjoyment
to
feel
the
blood
bounding
in
the
veins
the
miserable
victim
flies
to
the
demon
of
strong
drink
for
relief
hence
misery
infamy
shame
crime
and
wretchedness
this
neglect
of
the
conditions
of
daily
health
is
a
frightfully
costly
thing
it
costs
the
rich
a
great
deal
of
money
in
the
shape
of
for
the
support
of
widows
made
husbandless
and
children
made
fatherless
by
typhus
it
costs
them
also
a
great
deal
in
disease
for
the
fever
often
spreads
from
the
dwellings
of
the
poor
into
the
homes
of
the
rich
and
carries
away
father
mother
or
children
it
costs
a
great
deal
in
subscriptions
to
maintain
dispensaries
infirmaries
houses
of
recovery
and
asylums
for
the
destitute
it
costs
the
poor
still
more
it
costs
them
their
health
which
is
their
only
capital
in
this
is
invested
their
all
if
they
lose
it
their
docket
is
struck
and
they
are
bankrupt
how
frightful
is
the
neglect
whether
it
be
on
the
part
of
society
or
of
individuals
which
robs
the
poor
man
of
his
health
and
makes
his
life
a
daily
death
why
then
is
not
sanitary
science
universally
adopted
and
enforced
we
fear
it
is
mainly
through
indifference
and
laziness
the
local
authorities
municipalities
and
boards
of
guardians
are
so
many
maclartys
in
their
way
like
that
dirty
matron
they
canna
be
fashed
to
remove
the
materials
of
disease
requires
industry
constant
attention
and
what
is
far
more
serious
increased
rates
the
foul
interests
hold
their
ground
and
bid
defiance
to
the
attacks
made
upon
them
things
did
very
well
they
say
in
the
good
old
times
why
should
they
not
do
so
now
when
typhus
or
cholera
breaks
out
they
tell
us
that
nobody
is
to
blame
that
terrible
nobody
how
much
he
has
to
answer
for
more
mischief
is
done
by
nobody
than
by
all
the
world
besides
nobody
adulterates
our
food
nobody
poisons
us
with
bad
drink
nobody
supplies
us
with
foul
water
nobody
spreads
fever
in
blind
alleys
and
unswept
lanes
nobody
leaves
towns
undrained
nobody
fills
gaols
penitentiaries
and
convict
stations
nobody
makes
poachers
thieves
and
drunkards
nobody
has
a
theory
too
a
dreadful
theory
it
is
embodied
in
two
words
let
alone
when
people
are
poisoned
by
plaster
of
paris
mixed
with
flour
let
alone
is
the
remedy
when
is
used
instead
of
hops
and
men
die
prematurely
it
is
easy
to
say
nobody
did
it
let
those
who
can
find
out
when
they
are
cheated
when
people
live
in
foul
dwellings
let
them
alone
let
wretchedness
do
its
work
do
not
interfere
with
death
it
matters
nothing
to
me
said
a
rich
man
who
heard
of
a
poor
woman
and
her
sick
child
being
driven
forth
from
a
town
for
begging
the
workhouse
authorities
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
and
sent
her
away
but
the
poor
woman
went
and
sat
down
with
her
child
at
the
rich
man
door
the
child
died
there
the
contagion
of
typhus
was
wafted
into
the
gilded
saloon
and
the
luxurious
and
the
rich
child
fell
a
victim
to
the
disease
but
nobody
has
considerably
less
power
in
society
than
he
once
had
and
our
hope
is
that
he
may
ultimately
follow
in
the
wake
of
old
bogie
and
disappear
altogether
wherever
there
is
suffering
and
social
depression
we
may
depend
upon
it
that
somebody
is
to
blame
the
responsibility
rests
somewhere
and
if
we
allow
it
to
remain
it
rests
with
us
we
may
not
be
able
to
cope
with
the
evil
as
individuals
but
it
becomes
us
to
unite
and
bring
to
bear
upon
the
evil
the
joint
moral
power
of
society
in
the
form
of
a
law
a
law
is
but
the
expression
of
a
combined
will
and
it
does
that
for
society
which
society
in
its
individual
and
separate
action
can
not
so
well
or
efficiently
do
for
itself
laws
may
do
too
much
they
may
meddle
with
things
which
ought
to
be
let
alone
but
the
abuse
of
a
thing
is
no
proper
argument
against
its
use
in
cases
where
its
employment
is
urgently
called
for
mere
improvement
of
towns
however
as
respects
drainage
sewerage
paving
water
supply
and
abolition
of
cellar
dwellings
will
effect
comparatively
little
unless
we
can
succeed
in
carrying
the
improvement
further
namely
into
the
homes
of
the
people
themselves
a
system
of
sanitary
measures
may
ensure
external
cleanliness
may
provide
that
the
soil
on
which
the
streets
of
houses
are
built
shall
be
relieved
of
all
superfluous
moisture
and
that
all
animal
and
vegetable
refuse
shall
be
promptly
removed
so
that
the
air
circulating
through
the
streets
and
floating
from
them
into
the
houses
of
the
inhabitants
shall
not
be
laden
with
poisonous
miasmata
the
source
of
disease
suffering
and
untimely
death
cellar
dwellings
may
be
prohibited
and
certain
regulations
as
to
the
buildings
hereafter
to
be
erected
may
also
be
enforced
but
here
municipal
or
parochial
authority
stops
it
can
go
no
further
it
can
not
penetrate
into
the
home
and
it
is
not
necessary
that
it
should
do
so
the
individual
efforts
of
the
community
themselves
are
therefore
needed
and
any
legislative
enactments
which
dispensed
with
these
would
probably
be
an
evil
the
government
does
not
build
the
houses
in
which
the
people
dwell
these
are
provided
by
employers
and
by
capitalists
small
and
large
it
is
necessary
therefore
to
enlist
these
interests
in
the
cause
of
sanitary
improvement
in
order
to
ensure
success
individual
capitalists
have
already
done
much
to
provide
wholesome
houses
for
their
working
people
and
have
found
their
account
in
so
doing
by
their
increased
health
as
well
as
in
their
moral
improvement
in
all
ways
capitalists
imbued
with
a
benevolent
and
philanthropic
spirit
can
thus
spread
blessings
far
and
wide
and
were
a
few
enterprising
builders
in
every
town
to
take
up
this
question
practically
and
provide
a
class
of
houses
for
workpeople
with
suitable
accommodation
provided
with
arrangements
for
ventilation
cleanliness
and
separation
of
the
sexes
such
as
health
and
comfort
require
they
would
really
be
conferring
an
amount
of
benefit
on
the
community
at
large
and
at
the
same
time
we
believe
upon
themselves
which
it
would
not
be
easy
to
overestimate
but
there
also
needs
the
active
of
the
dwellers
in
poor
men
homes
themselves
they
too
must
join
cordially
in
the
sanitary
movement
otherwise
comparatively
little
good
can
be
effected
you
may
provide
an
efficient
water
supply
yet
if
the
housewife
will
not
use
the
water
as
it
ought
to
be
used
if
she
be
lazy
and
dirty
the
house
will
be
foul
and
comfortless
still
you
may
provide
for
ventilation
yet
if
offensive
matters
be
not
removed
and
doors
and
windows
are
kept
closed
the
pure
outer
air
will
be
excluded
and
the
house
will
still
smell
fusty
and
unwholesome
in
any
case
there
must
be
a
cleanly
woman
to
superintend
the
affairs
of
the
house
and
she
can
not
be
made
so
by
act
of
parliament
the
sanitary
commissioners
can
not
by
any
notification
convert
the
slatternly
shrew
into
a
tidy
housewife
nor
the
disorderly
drunkard
into
an
industrious
husband
there
must
therefore
be
individual
effort
on
the
part
of
the
housewife
in
every
working
man
home
as
a
recent
writer
on
home
reform
observes
we
must
begin
by
insisting
that
however
much
of
the
physical
and
moral
evils
of
the
working
classes
may
be
justly
attributable
to
their
dwellings
it
is
too
often
the
case
that
more
ought
in
truth
to
be
attributed
to
themselves
for
surely
the
inmate
depends
less
on
the
house
than
the
house
on
the
inmate
as
mind
has
more
power
over
matter
than
matter
over
mind
let
a
dwelling
be
ever
so
poor
and
incommodious
yet
a
family
with
decent
and
cleanly
habits
will
contrive
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
will
take
care
that
there
shall
be
nothing
offensive
in
it
which
they
have
power
to
remove
whereas
a
model
house
fitted
up
with
every
convenience
and
comfort
which
modern
science
can
supply
will
if
occupied
by
persons
of
intemperate
and
uncleanly
habits
speedily
become
a
disgrace
and
a
nuisance
a
sober
industrious
and
cleanly
couple
will
impart
an
air
of
decency
and
respectability
to
the
poorest
dwelling
while
the
spendthrift
the
drunkard
or
the
gambler
will
convert
a
palace
into
a
scene
of
discomfort
and
disgust
since
therefore
so
much
depends
on
the
character
and
conduct
of
the
parties
themselves
it
is
right
that
they
should
feel
their
responsibility
in
this
matter
and
that
they
should
know
and
attend
to
the
various
points
connected
with
the
improvement
of
their
own
homes
while
this
important
truth
should
be
kept
steadily
in
view
every
possible
exertion
ought
at
the
same
time
to
be
made
to
provide
a
greater
abundance
of
comfortable
decent
and
comely
dwellings
for
the
working
classes
for
it
is
to
be
lamented
that
in
many
districts
they
are
as
it
were
forced
by
the
necessities
of
their
condition
to
gravitate
into
localities
and
to
inhabit
dwellings
where
decency
is
rendered
almost
impossible
where
life
becomes
a
slow
dying
and
where
the
influences
operating
on
the
entire
human
energies
physical
and
moral
are
of
the
most
deleterious
character
homes
are
the
manufactories
of
men
and
as
the
homes
are
so
will
the
men
be
mind
will
be
degraded
by
the
physical
influences
around
it
decency
will
be
destroyed
by
constant
contact
with
impurity
and
defilement
and
coarseness
of
manners
habits
and
tastes
will
become
inevitable
you
can
not
rear
a
kindly
nature
sensitive
against
evil
careful
of
proprieties
and
desirous
of
moral
and
intellectual
improvement
amidst
the
darkness
dampness
disorder
and
discomfort
which
unhappily
characterize
so
large
a
portion
of
the
dwellings
of
the
poor
in
our
large
towns
and
until
we
can
by
some
means
or
other
improve
their
domestic
accommodation
their
low
moral
and
social
condition
must
be
regarded
as
inevitable
we
want
not
only
a
better
class
of
dwellings
but
we
require
the
people
to
be
so
educated
as
to
appreciate
them
an
irish
landlord
took
his
tenantry
out
of
their
mud
huts
and
removed
them
into
comfortable
dwellings
which
he
had
built
for
their
accommodation
when
he
returned
to
his
estate
he
was
greatly
disappointed
the
houses
were
as
untidy
and
uncomfortable
as
before
the
pig
was
still
under
the
bed
and
the
hens
over
it
the
concrete
floor
was
as
dirty
as
the
mud
one
had
been
the
panes
of
the
windows
were
broken
and
the
garden
was
full
of
weeds
the
landlord
wrote
to
a
friend
in
despair
the
friend
replied
you
have
begun
at
the
wrong
end
you
ought
to
have
taught
them
the
value
of
cleanliness
thriftiness
and
comfort
to
begin
at
the
beginning
therefore
we
must
teach
the
people
the
necessity
of
cleanliness
its
virtues
and
its
wholesomeness
for
which
purpose
it
is
requisite
that
they
should
be
intelligent
capable
of
understanding
ideas
conveyed
in
words
able
to
discern
able
to
read
able
to
think
in
short
the
people
as
children
must
first
have
been
to
school
and
properly
taught
there
whereas
we
have
allowed
the
majority
of
the
working
people
to
grow
up
untaught
nearly
half
of
them
unable
to
read
and
write
and
then
we
expect
them
to
display
the
virtues
prudence
judgment
and
forethought
of
beings
it
is
of
the
first
importance
to
teach
people
cleanly
habits
this
can
be
done
without
teaching
them
either
reading
or
writing
cleanliness
is
more
than
wholesomeness
it
furnishes
an
atmosphere
of
and
influences
the
moral
condition
of
the
entire
household
it
is
the
best
exponent
of
the
spirit
of
thrift
it
is
to
the
economy
of
the
household
what
hygiene
is
to
the
human
body
it
should
preside
at
every
detail
of
domestic
service
it
indicates
comfort
and
it
is
among
the
distinctive
attributes
of
civilisation
and
marks
the
progress
of
nations
paley
was
accustomed
to
direct
the
particular
attention
of
travellers
in
foreign
countries
to
the
condition
of
the
people
as
respects
cleanliness
and
the
local
provisions
for
the
prevention
of
pollution
he
was
of
opinion
that
a
greater
insight
might
thus
be
obtained
into
their
habits
of
decency
and
industry
and
into
their
moral
and
social
condition
generally
than
from
facts
of
any
other
description
people
are
cleanly
in
proportion
as
they
are
decent
industrious
and
unclean
people
are
uncivilized
the
dirty
classes
of
great
towns
are
invariably
the
dangerous
classes
of
those
towns
and
if
we
would
civilize
the
classes
yet
uncivilized
we
must
banish
dirt
from
amongst
them
yet
dirt
forms
no
part
of
our
nature
it
is
a
parasite
feeding
upon
human
life
and
destroying
it
it
is
hideous
and
disgusting
there
can
be
no
beauty
where
it
is
the
prettiest
woman
is
made
repulsive
by
it
children
are
made
fretful
impatient
and
by
it
men
are
degraded
and
made
reckless
by
it
there
is
little
modesty
where
dirt
is
for
dirty
is
indecency
there
can
be
little
purity
of
mind
where
the
person
is
impure
for
the
body
is
the
temple
of
the
soul
and
must
be
cleansed
and
purified
to
be
worthy
of
the
shrine
within
dirt
has
an
affinity
with
and
drunkenness
the
sanitary
inquirers
have
clearly
made
out
that
the
dirty
classes
are
the
drunken
classes
and
that
they
are
prone
to
seek
in
the
stupefaction
of
beer
gin
and
opium
a
refuge
from
the
miserable
depression
caused
by
the
foul
conditions
in
which
they
live
we
need
scarcely
refer
to
the
moral
as
well
as
the
physical
beauty
of
cleanliness
cleanliness
which
indicates
and
is
the
root
of
many
fine
virtues
and
especially
of
purity
delicacy
and
decency
we
might
even
go
farther
and
say
that
purity
of
thought
and
feeling
result
from
habitual
purity
of
body
for
the
mind
and
heart
of
man
are
to
a
very
great
extent
influenced
by
external
conditions
and
circumstances
and
habit
and
custom
as
regards
outward
things
stamp
themselves
deeply
on
the
whole
character
alike
upon
the
moral
feelings
and
the
intellectual
powers
moses
was
the
most
practical
of
sanitary
reformers
among
the
eastern
nations
generally
cleanliness
is
a
part
of
religion
they
esteem
it
not
only
as
next
to
godliness
but
as
a
part
of
godliness
itself
they
connect
the
idea
of
internal
sanctity
with
that
of
external
purification
they
feel
that
it
would
be
an
insult
to
the
maker
they
worship
to
come
into
his
presence
covered
with
impurity
hence
the
mahommedans
devote
almost
as
much
care
to
the
erection
of
baths
as
to
that
of
mosques
and
alongside
the
place
of
worship
is
usually
found
the
place
of
cleansing
so
that
the
faithful
may
have
the
ready
means
of
purification
previous
to
their
act
of
worship
what
worship
says
a
great
writer
is
there
not
in
mere
washing
perhaps
one
of
the
most
moral
things
a
man
in
common
cases
has
it
in
his
power
to
do
strip
thyself
go
into
the
bath
or
were
it
into
the
limpid
pool
of
a
running
brook
and
there
wash
and
be
clean
thou
wilt
step
out
again
a
purer
and
a
better
man
this
consciousness
of
perfect
outer
pureness
that
to
thy
skin
there
now
adheres
no
foreign
speck
of
imperfection
how
it
radiates
on
thee
with
cunning
symbolic
influences
to
thy
very
soul
thou
hast
an
increased
tendency
towards
all
good
things
whatsoever
the
oldest
eastern
sages
with
joy
and
holy
gratitude
had
felt
it
to
be
so
and
that
it
was
the
maker
gift
and
will
the
common
of
men
women
and
children
depends
upon
attention
to
what
at
first
sight
may
appear
comparatively
trivial
matters
and
unless
these
small
matters
be
attended
to
comfort
in
person
mind
and
feeling
is
absolutely
impossible
the
physical
satisfaction
of
a
child
for
example
depends
upon
attention
to
its
feeding
clothing
and
washing
these
are
the
commonest
of
common
things
and
yet
they
are
of
the
most
essential
importance
if
the
child
is
not
properly
fed
and
clothed
it
will
grow
up
feeble
and
and
as
the
child
is
so
will
the
man
be
grown
people
can
not
be
comfortable
without
regular
attention
to
these
common
matters
every
one
needs
and
ought
to
have
comfort
at
home
and
comfort
is
the
united
product
of
cleanliness
thrift
regularity
industry
in
short
a
continuous
performance
of
duties
each
in
itself
apparently
trivial
the
cooking
of
a
potato
the
baking
of
a
loaf
the
mending
of
a
shirt
the
darning
of
a
pair
of
stockings
the
making
of
a
bed
the
scrubbing
of
a
floor
the
washing
and
dressing
of
a
baby
are
all
matters
of
no
great
moment
but
a
woman
ought
to
know
how
to
do
these
before
the
management
of
a
household
however
poor
is
entrusted
to
her
why
asked
lord
ashburton
in
a
lecture
to
the
students
of
the
wolvesey
why
was
one
mother
of
a
family
a
better
economist
than
another
why
could
one
live
in
abundance
where
another
starved
why
in
similar
dwellings
were
the
children
of
one
parent
healthy
of
another
puny
and
ailing
why
could
this
labourer
do
with
ease
a
task
that
would
kill
his
fellow
it
was
not
luck
nor
chance
that
decided
those
differences
it
was
the
patient
observation
of
nature
that
suggested
to
some
gifted
minds
rules
for
their
guidance
which
had
escaped
the
heedlessness
of
others
it
is
not
so
much
however
the
patient
observation
of
nature
as
good
training
in
the
home
and
in
the
school
that
enables
some
women
to
accomplish
so
much
more
than
others
in
the
development
of
human
beings
and
the
promotion
of
human
comfort
and
to
do
this
efficiently
women
as
well
as
men
require
to
be
instructed
as
to
the
nature
of
the
objects
upon
which
they
work
take
one
branch
of
science
as
an
illustration
the
physiological
in
this
science
we
hold
that
every
woman
should
receive
some
instruction
and
why
because
if
the
laws
of
physiology
were
understood
by
women
children
would
grow
up
into
better
healthier
happier
and
probably
wiser
men
and
women
children
are
subject
to
certain
physiological
laws
the
observance
of
which
is
necessary
for
their
health
and
comfort
is
it
not
reasonable
therefore
to
expect
that
women
should
know
something
of
those
laws
and
of
their
operation
if
they
are
ignorant
of
them
they
will
be
liable
to
commit
all
sorts
of
blunders
productive
of
suffering
disease
and
death
to
what
are
we
to
attribute
the
frightful
mortality
of
children
in
most
of
our
large
towns
where
of
all
that
are
born
perish
before
they
reach
their
fifth
year
if
women
as
well
as
men
knew
something
of
the
laws
of
healthy
living
about
the
nature
of
the
atmosphere
how
its
free
action
upon
the
blood
is
necessary
to
health
of
the
laws
of
ventilation
cleanliness
and
nutrition
we
can
not
but
think
that
the
moral
not
less
than
the
physical
condition
of
the
human
beings
committed
to
their
charge
would
be
greatly
improved
and
promoted
were
anything
like
a
proper
attention
given
to
common
things
there
would
not
be
such
an
amount
of
discomfort
disease
and
mortality
amongst
the
young
but
we
accustom
people
to
act
as
if
there
were
no
such
provisions
as
natural
laws
if
we
violate
them
we
do
not
escape
the
consequences
because
we
have
been
ignorant
of
their
mode
of
operation
we
have
been
provided
with
intelligence
that
we
might
them
and
if
society
keep
its
members
blind
and
ignorant
the
evil
consequences
are
inevitably
reaped
thus
tens
of
thousands
perish
for
lack
of
knowledge
of
even
the
smallest
and
yet
most
necessary
conditions
of
right
living
women
have
also
need
to
be
taught
the
important
art
of
domestic
economy
if
they
do
not
earn
the
family
income
at
least
they
have
to
spend
the
money
earned
and
their
instruction
ought
to
have
a
view
to
the
spending
of
that
money
wisely
for
this
purpose
a
knowledge
of
arithmetic
is
absolutely
necessary
some
may
say
what
use
can
a
woman
have
for
arithmetic
but
when
men
marry
they
soon
find
this
out
if
the
woman
who
has
a
household
to
manage
be
innocent
of
addition
and
multiplication
and
if
she
fail
to
keep
a
record
of
her
income
or
expenditure
she
will
before
long
find
herself
in
great
trouble
she
will
find
that
she
can
not
make
the
ends
meet
and
then
run
into
debt
if
she
spend
too
much
on
dress
she
will
have
too
little
for
food
or
education
she
will
commit
extravagances
in
one
direction
or
another
and
thus
subject
her
household
to
great
discomfort
she
may
also
bring
her
husband
into
trouble
through
the
debts
she
has
contracted
and
make
a
beginning
of
his
misfortunes
and
sometimes
of
his
ruin
much
might
be
said
in
favour
of
household
management
and
especially
in
favour
of
improved
cookery
meals
is
a
source
of
discomfort
in
many
families
bad
cooking
is
waste
waste
of
money
and
loss
of
comfort
whom
god
has
joined
in
matrimony
joints
and
potatoes
have
very
often
put
asunder
among
the
common
things
which
educators
should
teach
the
rising
generation
this
ought
certainly
not
to
be
overlooked
it
is
the
commonest
and
yet
most
neglected
of
the
branches
of
female
education
the
greater
part
of
human
labour
is
occupied
in
the
direct
production
of
the
materials
for
human
food
the
farming
classes
and
their
labourers
devote
themselves
to
the
planting
rearing
and
reaping
of
oats
and
other
cereals
and
the
grazing
farmer
to
the
production
of
cattle
and
sheep
for
the
maintenance
of
the
population
at
large
all
these
articles
corn
beef
mutton
and
are
handed
over
to
the
female
half
of
the
human
species
to
be
converted
into
food
for
the
sustenance
of
themselves
their
husbands
and
their
families
how
do
they
use
their
power
can
they
cook
have
they
been
taught
to
cook
is
it
not
a
fact
that
in
this
country
cooking
is
one
of
the
lost
or
undiscovered
arts
thousands
of
artizans
and
labourers
are
deprived
of
half
the
actual
nutriment
of
their
food
and
continue
because
their
wives
are
utterly
ignorant
of
the
art
of
cooking
they
are
yet
in
entire
darkness
as
to
the
economizing
of
food
and
the
means
of
rendering
it
palatable
and
digestible
even
the
middle
classes
are
badly
served
in
this
respect
if
we
could
see
says
a
public
writer
by
the
help
of
an
asmodeus
what
is
going
on
at
the
dinner
hour
of
the
humbler
of
the
middle
class
what
a
spectacle
of
discomfort
waste
and
consequent
it
would
be
the
man
quarrels
with
his
wife
because
there
is
nothing
he
can
eat
and
he
generally
makes
up
in
drink
for
the
deficiencies
in
the
article
of
food
there
is
thus
not
only
the
direct
waste
of
food
and
detriment
to
health
but
the
further
consequent
waste
of
the
use
of
spirits
with
its
injury
to
the
habits
and
the
health
on
the
other
hand
people
who
eat
well
drink
moderately
the
satisfaction
of
the
appetite
dispensing
with
the
necessity
for
resorting
to
stimulants
good
humour
too
and
good
health
follow
a
good
meal
and
by
a
good
meal
we
mean
anything
however
simple
well
dressed
in
its
way
a
rich
man
may
live
very
expensively
and
very
ill
and
a
poor
man
may
live
frugally
and
very
well
if
it
be
his
good
fortune
to
have
a
good
cook
in
his
wife
or
in
his
servant
the
most
worthless
unit
in
a
family
is
an
wife
or
an
indolent
woman
of
any
sort
the
fair
sex
are
sometimes
very
acute
in
what
concerns
themselves
they
keep
a
tight
hand
over
their
dressmakers
and
milliners
they
can
tell
to
a
thread
when
a
flounce
is
too
narrow
or
a
tuck
too
deep
but
if
their
knowledge
only
extends
to
their
own
dress
they
are
not
but
incumbrances
if
they
know
nothing
of
their
kitchen
and
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
cook
their
table
will
soon
become
intolerable
bad
soup
soft
and
flabby
fish
meat
burnt
outside
and
raw
within
the
husband
will
soon
fly
from
the
barmecide
feast
and
take
refuge
in
his
club
where
he
will
not
only
find
food
that
he
can
digest
but
at
the
same
time
fly
from
the
domestic
discord
that
usually
accompanies
victuals
at
home
smee
says
that
diseases
of
the
digestive
organs
greatly
exceed
in
england
the
relative
number
found
in
other
countries
the
reason
is
that
in
no
other
country
do
men
eat
so
much
food
the
least
observant
of
travellers
must
have
been
struck
with
admiration
at
the
readiness
with
which
a
dinner
of
eight
or
ten
dishes
of
various
eatables
makes
its
appearance
in
foreign
inns
particularly
when
he
remembers
the
perpetual
mutton
chop
and
mashed
potatoes
of
the
english
road
the
author
remembers
arriving
at
a
roadside
inn
in
a
remote
part
of
dauphiny
immediately
under
the
foot
of
the
pic
du
midi
on
looking
at
the
clay
floor
and
the
worn
state
of
the
furniture
he
remarked
to
his
friend
surely
we
can
get
no
dinner
here
wait
till
you
see
was
his
answer
in
about
the
table
though
propped
up
was
spread
with
a
clean
and
successive
dishes
of
soup
fowl
frite
french
beans
with
wholesome
bread
and
butter
made
their
appearance
in
the
principal
inns
of
most
provincial
towns
in
england
it
would
not
have
been
possible
to
obtain
such
a
dinner
great
would
be
the
gain
to
the
community
if
cookery
were
made
an
ordinary
branch
of
female
education
to
the
poor
the
gain
would
be
incalculable
among
the
prizes
which
the
bountifuls
of
both
sexes
are
fond
of
bestowing
in
the
country
we
should
like
to
see
some
offered
for
the
best
boiled
potato
the
best
grilled
mutton
chop
and
the
best
seasoned
soup
or
broth
in
writing
of
a
potato
we
are
aware
that
we
shall
incur
the
contempt
of
many
for
attaching
importance
to
a
thing
they
suppose
to
be
so
common
but
the
fact
is
that
their
contempt
arises
as
is
often
the
origin
of
contempt
from
their
ignorance
there
being
not
one
person
in
a
hundred
who
has
ever
seen
and
tasted
that
great
rarity
a
potato
footnote
in
short
we
want
common
sense
in
cookery
as
in
most
other
things
food
should
be
used
and
not
abused
much
of
it
is
now
absolutely
wasted
wasted
for
want
of
a
little
art
in
cooking
it
food
is
not
only
wasted
by
bad
cooking
but
much
of
it
is
thrown
away
which
french
women
would
convert
into
something
savoury
and
digestible
health
morals
and
family
enjoyments
are
all
connected
with
the
question
of
cookery
above
all
it
is
the
handmaid
of
thrift
it
makes
the
most
and
the
best
of
the
bounties
of
god
it
wastes
nothing
but
turns
everything
to
account
every
englishwoman
whether
gentle
or
simple
ought
to
be
accomplished
in
an
art
which
confers
so
much
comfort
health
and
wealth
upon
the
members
of
her
household
it
appears
to
me

joseph
corbett
a
birmingham
operative
before
a
parliamentary
committee
holds
true
of
many
working
people
in
the
manufacturing
districts
my
mother
he
said
worked
in
a
manufactory
from
a
very
early
age
she
was
clever
and
industrious
and
moreover
she
had
the
reputation
of
being
virtuous
she
was
regarded
as
an
excellent
match
for
a
working
man
she
was
married
early
she
became
the
mother
of
eleven
children
i
am
the
eldest
to
the
best
of
her
ability
she
performed
the
important
duties
of
a
wife
and
mother
but
she
was
lamentably
deficient
in
domestic
knowledge
in
that
most
important
of
all
human
instruction
how
to
make
the
home
and
the
fireside
to
possess
a
charm
for
her
husband
and
children
she
had
never
received
one
single
lesson
she
had
children
apace
as
she
recovered
from
her
so
she
went
to
work
the
babe
being
brought
to
her
at
stated
times
to
receive
nourishment
as
the
family
increased
so
everything
like
comfort
disappeared
altogether
the
power
to
make
home
cheerful
and
comfortable
was
never
given
to
her
she
knew
not
the
value
of
cherishing
in
my
father
mind
a
love
of
domestic
objects
not
one
moment
happiness
did
i
ever
see
under
my
roof
all
this
dismal
state
of
things
i
can
distinctly
trace
to
the
entire
and
perfect
absence
of
all
training
and
instruction
to
my
mother
he
became
intemperate
and
his
intemperance
made
her
necessitous
she
made
many
efforts
to
abstain
from
but
her
pecuniary
necessities
forced
her
back
into
the
shop
the
family
was
large
and
every
moment
was
required
at
home
i
have
known
her
after
the
close
of
a
hard
day
work
sit
up
nearly
all
night
for
several
nights
together
washing
and
mending
clothes
my
father
could
have
no
comfort
there
these
domestic
obligations
which
in
a
house
even
in
that
of
a
working
man
where
there
are
prudence
and
good
management
would
be
done
so
as
not
to
annoy
the
husband
were
to
my
father
a
sort
of
annoyance
and
he
from
an
ignorant
and
mistaken
notion
sought
comfort
in
an
alehouse
my
mother
ignorance
of
household
duties
my
father
consequent
irritability
and
intemperance
the
frightful
poverty
the
constant
quarrelling
the
pernicious
example
to
my
brothers
and
sisters
the
bad
effect
upon
the
future
conduct
of
my
brothers
one
and
all
of
us
being
forced
out
to
work
so
young
that
our
feeble
earnings
would
produce
only
a
week
cold
and
hunger
and
the
innumerable
sufferings
of
my
childhood
crowd
upon
my
mind
and
overpower
me
they
keep
alive
a
deep
anxiety
for
the
emancipation
of
thousands
of
families
in
this
great
town
birmingham
and
neighbourhood
who
are
in
a
similar
state
of
horrible
misery
my
own
experience
tells
me
that
the
instruction
of
the
females
in
the
work
of
a
house
in
teaching
them
to
produce
cheerfulness
and
comfort
at
the
fireside
would
prevent
a
great
amount
of
misery
and
crime
there
would
be
fewer
drunken
husbands
and
disobedient
children
as
a
working
man
within
my
own
observation
female
education
is
disgracefully
neglected
i
attach
more
importance
to
it
than
to
anything
else

the

deem
no

in

gentle
for

though
he
be

he
is
gentle
if
he

though
poor

comes
that

thee
although
men
are
accused
for
not
knowing
their
own
weakness
yet
perhaps
as
few
know
their

it
is
in
men
as

vein
of

which
the
owner
knows
not

the
art
of
living
deserves
a
place
among
the
fine
arts
like
literature
it
may
be
ranked
with
the
humanities
it
is
the
art
of
turning
the
means
of
living
to
the
best
account
of
making
the
best
of
everything
it
is
the

extracting
from
life
its
highest
enjoyment
and
through
it
of
reaching
its
highest
results
to
live
happily
the
exercise
of
no
small
degree
of
art
is
required
like
poetry
and
painting
the
art
of
living
comes
chiefly
by
nature
but
all
can
cultivate
and
develop
it
it
can
be
fostered
by
parents
and
teachers
and
perfected
by
without
intelligence
it
can
not

happiness
is
not
like
a

and
beautiful
gem
so
uncommon
and
rare
that
all
search
for
it
is
vain
all
efforts
to
obtain
it
hopeless
but
it
consists
of
a
series
of
smaller
and
commoner
gems
grouped
and
set
together
forming
a
pleasing
and
graceful
whole
happiness
consists
in
the
enjoyment
of
little
pleasures
scattered
along
the
common
path
of
life
which
in
the
eager
search
for
some
great
and
exciting
joy
we
are
apt
to
overlook
it
finds
delight
in
the
performance
of
common
duties
faithfully
and
honourably
fulfilled
the
art
of
living
is
abundantly
exemplified
in
actual
life
take
two
men
of
equal
means
one
of
whom
knows
the
art
of
living
and
the
other
not
the
one
has
the
and
the
intelligent
mind
nature
is
ever
new
to
him
and
full
of
beauty
he
can
live
in
the
present
rehearse
the
past
or
anticipate
the
glory
of
the
future
with
him
life
has
a
deep
meaning
and
requires
the
performance
of
duties
which
are
satisfactory
to
his
conscience
and
are
therefore
pleasurable
he
improves
himself
acts
upon
his
age
helps
to
elevate
the
depressed
classes
and
is
active
in
every
good
work
his
hand
is
never
tired
his
mind
is
never
weary
he
goes
through
life
joyfully
helping
others
to
its
enjoyment
intelligence
ever
expanding
gives
him
every
day
fresh
insight
into
men
and
things
he
lays
down
his
life
full
of
honour
and
blessing
and
his
greatest
monument
is
the
good
deeds
he
has
done
and
the
beneficent
example
he
has
set
before
his
the
other
has
comparatively
little
pleasure
in
life
he
has
scarcely
reached
manhood
ere
he
has
exhausted
its
enjoyments
money
has
done
everything
that
it
could
for
him
yet
he
feels
life
to
be
vacant
and
cheerless
travelling
does
him
no
good
for
for
him
history
has
no
meaning
he
is
only
alive
to
the
impositions
of
innkeepers
and
couriers
and
the
disagreeableness
of
travelling
for
days
amidst
great
mountains
among
peasants
and
sheep
cramped
up
in
a
carriage
picture
galleries
he
feels
to
be
a
bore
and
he
looks
into
them
because
other
people
do
these
pleasures
soon
tire
him
and
he
becomes
when
he
grows
old
and
has
run
the
round
of
fashionable
dissipations
and
there
is
nothing
left
which
he
can
relish
life
becomes
a
masquerade
in
which
he
recognizes
only
knaves
hypocrites
and
flatterers
though
he
does
not
enjoy
life
yet
he
is
terrified
to
leave
it
then
the
curtain
falls
with
all
his
wealth
life
has
been
to
him
a
failure
for
he
has
not
known
the
art
of
living
without
which
life
can
not
be
enjoyed
it
is
not
wealth
that
gives
the
true
zest
to
life
but
reflection
appreciation
taste
culture
above
all
the
seeing
eye
and
the
feeling
heart
are
indispensable
with
these
the
humblest
lot
may
be
made
blest
labour
and
toil
may
be
associated
with
the
highest
thoughts
and
the
purest
tastes
the
lot
of

may
thus
become

that
all
moral
philosophy
is
as

as

the
entire

of

human
condition
within

even
in

comfort
good
taste
is
a
real
economist
as
well
as
an
enhancer
of
joy
scarcely
have
you
passed
the
doorstep
of
your
house
when
you
can
detect
whether
taste
presides
within
it
or
not
there
is
an
air
of
neatness
order
arrangement
grace
and
refinement
that
gives
a
thrill
of
pleasure
though
you
can
not
define
it
or
explain
how
it
is
there
is
a
flower
in
the
window
or
a
picture
against
the
wall
that
marks
the
home
of
taste
a
bird
sings
at
the
books
lie
about
and
the

though
common
is
tidy
suitable
and
it
may
be
even
elegant
the
art
of
living
extends
to
all
the
economies
of
the
household
it
selects
wholesome
food
and
serves
it
with
taste
there
is
no
profusion
the
fare
may
be
very
humble
but
it
has
a
savour
about
it
everything
is
so
clean
and
neat
the
water
so
sparkles
in
the
glass
that
you
do
not
desire
richer
viands
or
a
more
exciting
beverage
look
into
another
house
and
you
will
see
profusion
enough
without
either
taste
or
order
the
expenditure
is
larger
and
yet
you
do
not
feel
at
home
there
the
atmosphere
seems
to
be
full
of
discomfort
books
hats
shawls
and
stockings
in
course
of
repair
are
strewn
about
two
or
three
chairs
are
loaded
with
goods
the
rooms
are
no
matter
how
much
money
is
spent
it
does
not
mend
matters
taste
is
wanting
for
the
manager
of
the
household
has
not
yet
learnt
the
art
of
living
you
see
the
same
contrast
in
cottage
life
the
lot
of
poverty
is
sweetened
by
taste
it
selects
the
healthiest
openest
neighbourhood
where
the
air
is
pure
and
the
streets
are
clean
you
see
at
a
glance
by
the
sanded
doorstep
and
the
without
a
speck
perhaps
blooming
roses
or
geraniums
shining
through
them
that
the
tenant
within
however
poor
knows
the
art
of
making
the
best
of
his
lot
how
different
from
the
foul
you
see
elsewhere
with
the
dirty
children
playing
in
the
gutters
the
women
lounging
by
the
and
the
air
of
sullen
poverty
that
seems
to
pervade
the
place
and
yet
the
weekly
income
in
the
former
home
may
be
no
greater
perhaps
even
less
than
in
that
of
the
other
how
is
it
that
of
two
men
working
in
the
same
field
or
in
the
same
shop
one
is
merry
as
a
lark
always
cheerful
and
as
clean
as

but

literally

none
but
only

and

why
is
it
that
there
is
so
remarkable
a
difference
between
these
two
men
simply
for
this
reason
that
the
one
has
the
intelligence
and
the
art
to
extract
joy
and
happiness
from
life
to
be
happy
himself
and
to
make
those
about
him
happy
whereas
the
other
has
not
cultivated
his
intelligence
and
knows
nothing
whatever
of
the
art
of
either
making
himself
or
his
family
happy
with
the
one
life
is
a
scene
of
loving
helping
and
sympathizing
of
carefulness
forethought
and
calculation
of
reflection
action
and
duty
with
the
other
it
is
only
a
rough
scramble
for
meat

duty
is
not
thought
of
reflection
is
banished
prudent
forethought
is
never
for
a
moment
entertained
but
look
to
the
result
the
former
is
respected
by
his
and
beloved
by
his
family
he
is
an
example
of
and
to
all
who
are
within
reach
of
his
influence
whereas
the
other
is
as
unreflective
and
miserable
as
nature
will
allow
him
to
be
he
is
shunned
by
good
men
his
family
are
afraid
at
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
his
wife
perhaps
trembling
at
his
approach
he
dies
without
leaving
any
regrets
behind
him
except
it
may
be
on
the
part
of
his
family
who
are
left
to
be
maintained
by
the
charity
of
the
public
or
by
the
pittance
doled
out
by
the
overseers
for
these
reasons
it
is
worth
every
man
while
to
study
the
important
art
of
living
happily
even
the
poorest
man

by
this
means
extract
an

need
not

ourselves

it
to
be
so

the
command
to
a
great
extent
over
our
own
lot
at
all
events
our
mind
is
our
own
possession
we
can
cherish
happy
thoughts
there
we
can
regulate
and
control
our
tempers
and
dispositions
to
a
considerable
extent
we
can
educate
ourselves
and
bring
out
the
better
part
of
our
nature
which
in
most
men
is
allowed
to
sleep
a
deep
sleep
we
can
read
good
books
cherish
pure
thoughts
and
lead
lives
of
peace
temperance
and
virtue
so
as
to
secure
the
respect
of
good
men
and

of
a
faithful
example
to
our

the

is

where
there

there
can
be

all

expects
to
have
something
as
a
compensation
for
his

least
that
his

can
do
for

truest
economy
the
best
housekeeping
the
worthiest
domestic
management
which
makes
the
home
so
pleasant
and
agreeable
that
a
man
feels
when
approaching
it
that
he
is
about
to
enter
a
sanctuary
and
that
when
there
there
is
no
alehouse
attraction
that
can
draw
him
away
from
it
some
say
that
we
worship
comfort
too
much
the
word
is
essentially
english
and
is
said
to
be
untranslateable
in
its
full
meaning
into
any
foreign
language
it
is
intimately
connected
with
the
fireside
in
warmer
climes
people
contrive
to
live
out
of
doors
they
sun
themselves
in
the
streets
half
their
life
is
in
public
the
genial
air
woos
them
forth
and
keeps
them
abroad
they
enter
their
houses
merely
to
eat
and
sleep
they
can
scarcely
be
said
to
there
how
different
is
it
with
us
the
raw
air
without
during
so
many
months
of
the
year
drives
us
within
doors
hence
we
cultivate
all
manner
of
home
pleasures
hence
the
host
of
delightful
associations
which
rise
up
in
the
mind
at
the
mention
of
the
word
home
hence
our
household
god
comfort
we
are
not
satisfied
merely
with
a
home
it
must
be
comfortable
the
most
wretched
indeed
are
those
who
have
no
homes
the
homeless
but
not
less
wretched
are
those
whose
homes
are
without
comfort
those
of
whom
charles
lamb
once
said
the
homes
of
the
very
poor
are
no
homes
it
is
comfort
then
that
is
the
soul
of
the
home
its
essential
principle
its
vital
element
comfort
does
not
mean
merely
warmth
good
furniture
good
eating
and
drinking
it
means
something
higher
than
this
it
means
cleanliness
pure
air
order
frugality
in
a
word
and
domestic
government
comfort
is
the
soil
in
which
the
human
being
grows
not
only
physically
but
morally
comfort
lies
indeed
at
the
root
of
many
virtues
wealth
is
not
necessary
for
comfort
luxury
requires
wealth
but
not
comfort
a
poor
man
home
moderately
supplied
with
the
necessaries
of
life
presided
over
by
a
cleanly
frugal
housewife
may
contain
all
the
elements
of
comfortable
living
comfortlessness
is
for
the
most
part
caused
not
so
much
by
the
absence
of
sufficient
means
as
by
the
absence
of
the
requisite
knowledge
of
domestic
management
comfort
it
must
be
admitted
is
in
a
great
measure
what
is
comfort
to
one
man
would
be
misery
to
another
even
the
commonest
mechanic
of
this
day
would
consider
it
miserable
to
live
after
the
style
of
the
nobles
a
few
centuries
ago
to
sleep
on
straw
beds
and
live
in
rooms
littered
with
rushes
william
the
conqueror
had
neither
a
shirt
to
his
back
nor
a
pane
of
glass
to
his
windows
queen
elizabeth
was
one
of
the
first
to
wear
silk
stockings
the
queens
before
her
were
stockingless
comfort
depends
as
much
on
persons
as
on
things
it
is
out
of
the
character
and
temper
of
those
who
govern
homes
that
the
feeling
of
comfort
arises
much
more
than
out
of
handsome
furniture
heated
rooms
or
household
luxuries
and
conveniences
comfortable
people
are
good
temper
may
be
set
down
as
an
invariable
condition
of
comfort
there
must
be
peace
mutual
forbearance
mutual
help
and
a
disposition
to
make
the
best
of
everything
better
is
a
dinner
of
herbs
where
love
is
than
a
stalled
ox
and
hatred
therewith
comfortable
people
are
persons
of
common
sense
discretion
prudence
and
economy
they
have
a
natural
affinity
for
honesty
and
justice
goodness
and
truth
they
do
not
run
into
debt
for
that
is
a
species
of
dishonesty
they
live
within
their
means
and
lay
by
something
for
a
rainy
day
they
provide
for
the
things
of
their
own
household
yet
they
are
not
wanting
in
hospitality
and
benevolence
on
fitting
occasions
and
what
they
do
is
done
without
ostentation
comfortable
people
do
everything
in
order
they
are
systematic
steady
sober
industrious
they
dress
comfortably
they
adapt
themselves
to
the
season
neither
shivering
in
winter
nor
perspiring
in
summer
they
do
not
toil
after
a
fashionable
appearance
they
expend
more
on
warm
stockings
than
on
gold
rings
and
prefer
healthy
good
bedding
to
gaudy
their
chairs
are
solid
not
gimcrack
they
will
bear
sitting
upon
though
they
may
not
be
ornamental
the
organization
of
the
home
depends
for
the
most
part
upon
woman
she
is
necessarily
the
manager
of
every
family
and
household
how
much
therefore
must
depend
upon
her
intelligent
man
life
revolves
round
woman
she
is
the
sun
of
his
social
system
she
is
the
queen
of
domestic
life
the
comfort
of
every
home
mainly
depends
upon
her
upon
her
character
her
temper
her
power
of
organization
and
her
business
management
a
man
may
be
economical
but
unless
there
be
economy
at
home
his
frugality
will
be
comparatively
useless
a
man
can
not
thrive
the
proverb
says
unless
his
wife
let
him
is
homely
but
beneficent
though
unseen
of
the
world
it
makes
many
people
happy
it
works
upon
individuals
and
by
elevating
them
it
elevates
society
itself
it
is
in
fact
a
receipt
of
infallible
efficacy
for
conferring
the
greatest
possible
happiness
upon
the
greatest
possible
number
without
it
legislation
benevolence
and
philanthropy
are
mere
palliatives
sometimes
worse
than
useless
because
they
hold
out
hopes
which
are
for
the
most
part
disappointed
how
happy
does
a
man
go
forth
to
his
labour
or
his
business
and
how
doubly
happy
does
he
return
from
it
when
he
knows
that
his
means
are
carefully
husbanded
and
wisely
applied
by
a
judicious
and
wife
such
a
woman
is
not
only
a
power
in
her
own
house
but
her
example
goes
forth
amongst
her
neighbours
and
she
stands
before
them
as
a
model
and
a
pattern
the
habits
of
her
children
are
formed
after
her
habits
her
actual
life
becomes
the
model
after
which
they
unconsciously
mould
themselves
for
example
always
speaks
more
eloquently
than
words
it
is
instruction
in
action
wisdom
at
work
first
amongst
woman
qualities
is
the
intelligent
use
of
her
hands
and
fingers
every
one
knows
how
useful
how
indispensable
to
the
comfort
of
a
household
is
the
tidy
managing
handy
woman
pestalozzi
with
his
usual
sagacity
has
observed
that
half
the
education
of
a
woman
comes
through
her
fingers
there
are
wisdom
and
virtue
at
her
but
intellect
must
also
accompany
thrift
they
must
go
hand
in
hand
a
woman
must
not
only
be
clever
with
her
fingers
but
possessed
of
the
power
of
organizing
household
work
there
must
be
method
the
late
sir
arthur
helps
observed
that
as
women
are
at
present
educated
they
are
for
the
most
part
thoroughly
deficient
in
but
this
surely
might
be
remedied
by
training
to
take
a
very
humble
and
simple
instance
why
is
it
that
a
is
always
better
than
a
simply
because
a
man
is
more
methodical
in
his
arrangements
and
relies
more
upon
his
weights
and
measures
an
eminent
physician
told
me
that
he
thought
women
were
absolutely
deficient
in
the
appreciation
of
time
but
this
i
hold
to
be
merely
one
instance
of
their
general
want
of
accuracy
for
which
there
are
easy
remedies
that
is
easy
if
begun
early
enough
accordingly
to
manage
a
household
efficiently
there
must
be
method
without
this
work
can
not
be
got
through
satisfactorily
either
in
offices
workshops
or
households
by
arranging
work
properly
by
doing
everything
at
the
right
time
with
a
view
to
the
economy
of
labour
a
large
amount
of
business
can
be
accomplished
muddle
flies
before
method
and
disappears
there
is
also
a
method
in
spending
in
laying
out
money
which
is
as
valuable
to
the
housewife
as
method
is
in
accomplishing
her
work
money
slips
through
the
fingers
of
some
people
like
quicksilver
we
have
already
seen
that
many
men
are
spendthrifts
but
many
women
are
the
same
at
least
they
do
not
know
how
to
expend
their
husband
earnings
to
the
best
advantage
you
observe
things
very
much
out
of
place
frills
and
ruffles
and
stockings
fine
bonnets
and
clouted
shoes
silk
gowns
and
dirty
petticoats
while
the
husband
goes
about
ragged
and
torn
with
scarcely
a
clean
thing
about
him
industry
is
of
course
essential
this
is
the
soul
of
business
but
without
method
industry
will
be
less
productive
industry
may
sometimes
look
like
confusion
but
the
methodical
and
industrious
woman
gets
through
her
work
in
a
quiet
steady
style
without
fuss
or
noise
or
prudence
is
another
important
household
qualification
prudence
comes
from
cultivated
judgment
it
means
practical
wisdom
it
has
reference
to
fitness
to
propriety
it
judges
of
the
right
thing
to
be
done
and
of
the
right
way
of
doing
it
it
calculates
the
means
order
time
and
method
of
doing
prudence
learns
much
from
experience
quickened
by
knowledge
punctuality
is
another
eminently
household
qualification
how
many
grumblings
would
be
avoided
in
domestic
life
by
a
little
more
attention
being
paid
to
this
virtue
late
breakfasts
and
late
dinners
too
late
for
church
and
market
cleanings
out
of
time
and
washings
protracted
till
midnight
bills
put
off
with
a
call
again
engagements
and
promises
unfulfilled
what
a
host
of
little
nuisances
spring
to
mind
at
thought
of
the
unpunctual
housewife
the
unpunctual
woman
like
the
unpunctual
man
becomes
disliked
because
she
consumes
our
time
interferes
with
our
plans
causes
uneasy
feelings
and
virtually
tells
us
that
we
are
not
of
sufficient
importance
to
cause
her
to
be
more
punctual
to
the
business
man
time
is
money
and
to
the
business
woman
it
is
more
it
is
peace
comfort
and
domestic
prosperity
perseverance
is
another
good
household
habit
lay
down
a
good
plan
and
adhere
to
it
do
not
be
turned
from
it
without
a
sufficient
reason
follow
it
diligently
and
faithfully
and
it
will
yield
fruits
in
good
season
if
the
plan
be
a
prudent
one
based
on
practical
wisdom
a
ll
things
will
gravitate
towards
it
and
a
mutual
dependence
will
gradually
be
established
among
all
the
parts
of
the
domestic
system
we
might
furnish
numerous
practical
illustrations
of
the
truth
of
these
remarks
but
our
space
is
nearly
filled
up
and
we
must
leave
the
reader
to
supply
them
from
his
or
her
own
experience
there
are
many
other
illustrations
which
might
be
adduced
of
the
art
of
making
life
happy
the
management
of
the
temper
is
an
art
full
of
beneficent
results
by
kindness
cheerfulness
and
forbearance
we
can
be
happy
almost
at
will
and
at
the
same
time
spread
happiness
about
us
on
every
side
we
can
encourage
happy
thoughts
in
ourselves
and
others
we
can
be
sober
in
habit
what
can
a
wife
and
her
children
think
of
an
intemperate
husband
and
father
we
can
be
sober
in
language
and
shun
cursing
and
swearing
the
most
useless
unmeaning
and
brutal
of
vulgarities
nothing
can
be
so
silly
and
unmeaning
not
to
say
shocking
repulsive
and
sinful
as
the
oaths
so
common
in
the
mouths
of
vulgar
swearers
they
are
profanation
without
purpose
impiety
without
provocation
blasphemy
without
excuse
this
leads
us
to
remark
in
passing
that
in
this
country
we
are
not
sufficiently
instructed
in
the
art
of
good
manners
we
are
rather
gruff
and
sometimes
unapproachable
manners
do
make
the
man
as
the
proverb
alleges
but
manners
make
the
man
much
more
agreeable
a
man
may
be
noble
in
his
heart
true
in
his
dealings
virtuous
in
his
conduct
and
yet
unmannerly
suavity
of
disposition
and
gentleness
of
manners
give
the
finish
to
the
true
gentleman
by
good
manners
we
do
not
mean
etiquette
this
is
only
a
conventional
set
of
rules
adopted
by
what
is
called
good
society
and
many
of
the
rules
of
etiquette
are
of
the
essence
of
rudeness
etiquette
does
not
permit
genteel
people
to
recognize
in
the
streets
a
man
with
a
shabby
coat
though
he
be
their
brother
etiquette
is
a
liar
in
its
not
at
home
ordered
to
be
told
by
servants
to
callers
at
inconvenient
seasons
good
manners
include
many
requisites
but
they
chiefly
consist
in
politeness
courtesy
and
kindness
they
can
not
be
taught
by
rule
but
they
may
be
taught
by
example
it
has
been
said
that
politeness
is
the
art
of
showing
men
by
external
signs
the
internal
regard
we
have
for
them
but
a
man
may
be
perfectly
polite
to
another
without
necessarily
having
any
regard
for
him
good
manners
are
neither
more
nor
less
than
beautiful
behaviour
it
has
been
well
said
that
a
beautiful
form
is
better
than
a
beautiful
face
and
a
beautiful
behaviour
is
better
than
a
beautiful
form
it
gives
a
higher
pleasure
than
statues
or
pictures
it
is
the
finest
of
the
fine
arts
manner
is
the
ornament
of
action
indeed
a
good
action
without
a
good
manner
of
doing
it
is
stripped
of
half
its
value
a
poor
fellow
gets
into
difficulties
and
solicits
help
of
a
friend
he
obtains
it
but
it
is
with
a
that
but
i
do
like
lending
the
help
is
given
with
a
kind
of
kick
and
is
scarcely
accepted
as
a
favour
the
manner
of
the
giving
long
rankles
in
the
mind
of
the
acceptor
thus
good
manners
mean
kind
manners
benevolence
being
the
preponderating
element
in
all
kinds
of
pleasant
intercourse
between
human
beings
a
story
is
told
of
a
poor
soldier
having
one
day
called
at
the
shop
of
a
hairdresser
who
was
busy
with
his
customers
and
asked
relief
stating
that
he
had
stayed
beyond
his
leave
of
absence
and
unless
he
could
get
a
lift
on
the
coach
fatigue
and
severe
punishment
awaited
him
the
hairdresser
listened
to
his
story
respectfully
and
gave
him
a
guinea
god
bless
you
sir
exclaimed
the
soldier
astonished
at
the
amount
how
can
i
repay
you
i
have
nothing
in
the
world
but
this
pulling
out
a
dirty
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocket
it
is
a
receipt
for
making
blacking
it
is
the
best
that
was
ever
seen
many
a
i
have
had
for
it
from
the
officers
and
many
bottles
i
have
sold
may
you
be
able
to
get
something
for
it
to
repay
you
for
your
kindness
to
the
poor
soldier
oddly
enough
that
dirty
piece
of
paper
proved
worth
half
a
million
of
money
to
the
hairdresser
it
was
no
less
than
the
receipt
for
the
famous
day
and
martin
blacking
the
hairdresser
being
the
late
wealthy
day
whose
manufactory
is
one
of
the
notabilities
of
the
metropolis
good
manners
have
been
supposed
to
be
a
peculiar
mark
of
gentility
and
that
the
individual
exhibiting
them
has
been
born
in
some
upper
class
of
society
but
the
poorest
classes
may
exhibit
good
manners
towards
each
other
as
well
as
the
richest
one
may
be
polite
and
kind
towards
others
without
a
penny
in
the
purse
politeness
goes
very
far
yet
it
costs
nothing
it
is
the
cheapest
of
commodities
but
we
want
to
be
taught
good
manners
as
well
as
other
things
some
happy
natures
are
to
the
manner
born
but
the
bulk
of
men
need
to
be
taught
manners
and
this
can
only
be
efficiently
done
in
youth
we
have
said
that
working
men
might
study
good
manners
with
advantage
why
should
they
not
respect
themselves
and
each
other
it
is
by
their
demeanour
towards
each
other
in
other
words
by
their
manners
that
and
mutual
respect
are
indicated
we
have
been
struck
by
the
habitual
politeness
of
even
the
poorest
classes
on
the
continent
the
workman
lifts
his
cap
and
respectfully
salutes
his
in
passing
there
is
no
sacrifice
of
manliness
in
this
but
rather
grace
and
dignity
the
working
man
in
respecting
his
fellow
respects
himself
and
his
order
there
is
kindness
in
the
act
of
recognition
as
well
as
in
the
manner
in
which
it
is
denoted
we
might
learn
much
from
the
french
people
in
this
matter
they
are
not
only
polite
to
each
other
but
they
have
a
greater
respect
for
property
some
may
be
disposed
to
doubt
this
after
the
recent
destruction
of
buildings
in
paris
but
the
communists
must
be
regarded
as
altogether
exceptional
people
and
to
understand
the
french
character
we
must
look
to
the
body
of
the
population
scattered
throughout
france
there
we
find
property
much
more
respected
by
the
people
than
amongst
ourselves
even
the
beggar
respects
the
fruit
by
the
roadside
although
there
is
nobody
to
protect
it
the
reason
of
this
is
that
france
is
a
nation
of
small
proprietors
that
property
is
much
more
generally
diffused
and
exposed
and
parents
of
even
the
lowest
class
educate
their
children
in
carefulness
of
and
fidelity
to
the
property
of
others
this
respect
for
property
is
also
accompanied
with
that
respect
for
the
feelings
of
others
which
constitutes
what
is
called
good
manners
this
is
carefully
inculcated
in
the
children
of
all
ranks
in
france
they
are
very
rarely
rude
they
are
civil
to
strangers
they
are
civil
to
each
other
laing
in
his
notes
of
a
traveller
makes
these
remarks
this
deference
to
the
feelings
of
others
in
all
that
we
do
is
a
moral
habit
of
great
value
when
it
is
generally
diffused
and
enters
into
the
home
training
of
every
family
it
is
an
education
both
of
the
parent
and
child
in
morals
carried
on
through
the
medium
of
external
manners
it
is
a
fine
distinction
of
the
french
national
character
and
of
social
economy
that
practical
morality
is
more
generally
taught
through
manners
among
and
by
the
people
themselves
than
in
any
country
in
europe

the
same
kindly
feeling
might
be
observed
throughout
the
entire
social
intercourse
of
working
men
with
each
other
there
is
not
a
moment
in
their
lives
in
which
the
opportunity
does
not
occur
for
exhibiting
good
manners
in
the
workshop
in
the
street
and
at
home
provided
there
be
a
wish
to
please
others
by
kind
looks
and
ways
the
habit
of
combining
good
manners
with
every
action
will
soon
be
formed
it
is
not
merely
the
pleasure
a
man
gives
to
others
by
being
kind
to
them
he
receives
tenfold
more
pleasure
himself
the
man
who
gets
up
and
offers
his
chair
to
a
woman
or
to
an
old
man
trivial
though
the
act
may
seem
is
rewarded
by
his
own
heart
and
a
thrill
of
pleasure
runs
through
him
the
moment
he
has
performed
the
kindness
workpeople
need
to
practise
good
manners
towards
each
other
the
more
because
they
are
under
the
necessity
of
constantly
living
with
each
other
and
amongst
each
other
they
are
in
constant
contact
with
their
whereas
the
richer
classes
need
not
mix
with
men
unless
they
choose
and
then
they
can
select
whom
they
like
the
working
happiness
depends
much
more
upon
the
kind
looks
words
and
acts
of
those
immediately
about
him
than
the
rich
man
does
it
is
so
in
the
workshop
and
it
is
the
same
at
home
there
the
workman
can
not
retire
into
his
study
but
must
sit
amongst
his
family
by
the
side
of
his
wife
with
his
children
about
him
and
he
must
either
live
kindly
with
them
performing
kind
and
obliging
acts
towards
his
family
or
he
must
see
suffer
and
endure
the
intolerable
misery
of
reciprocal
unkindness
admitted
that
there
are
difficulties
in
the
way
of
working
men
cultivating
the
art
of
good
manners
that
their
circumstances
are
often
very
limited
and
their
position
unfavourable
yet
no
man
is
so
poor
but
that
he
can
be
civil
and
kind
if
he
choose
and
to
be
civil
and
kind
is
the
very
essence
of
good
manners
even
in
the
most
adverse
circumstances
a
man
may
try
to
do
his
best
if
he
do
if
he
speak
and
act
courteously
and
kindly
to
all
the
result
will
be
so
satisfactory
so
that
he
can
not
but
be
stimulated
to
persevere
in
the
same
course
he
will
diffuse
pleasure
about
him
in
the
home
make
friends
of
his
and
be
regarded
with
increased
kindness
and
respect
by
every
employer
the
civil
workman
will
exercise
increased
power
amongst
his
class
and
gradually
induce
them
to
imitate
him
by
his
persistent
steadiness
civility
and
kindness
thus

when
a
workman
reformed
the
habits
of
an
entire
workshop
then
besides
the
general
pleasure
arising
from
the
exercise
of
good
manners
there
is
a
great
deal
of
healthful
and
innocent
pleasure
to
be
derived
from
amusements
of
various
kinds
one
can
not
be
always
working
eating
and
sleeping
there
must
be
time
for
relaxation
time
for
mental
pleasures
time
for
bodily
exercise
there
is
a
profound
meaning
in
the
word
amusement
much
more
than
most
people
are
disposed
to
admit
in
fact
amusement
is
an
important
part
of
education
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
boy
or
the
man
who
plays
at
some
outdoor
game
is
wasting
his
time
amusement
of
any
kind
is
not
wasting
time
but
economizing
life
relax
and
exercise
frequently
if
you
would
enjoy
good
health
if
you
do
not
relax
and
take
no
exercise
the
results
will
soon
appear
in
bodily
ailments
which
always
accompany
sedentary
occupations
the
students
says
lord
derby
who
think
they
have
not
time
for
bodily
exercise
will
sooner
or
later
find
time
for
illness
there
are
people
in
the
world
who
would
if
they
had
the
power
hang
the

about
with

throw

shut
up
our

and
all
the
flowers
with
which
they
are
bedecked
and
doom
the
world
to
an
atmosphere
of
gloom
and
cheerlessness
there
is
no
reason
nor
morality
in
this
and
there
is
still
less
religion
a
benevolent
creator
has
endowed
man
with
an
eminent
capacity
for
enjoyment
has
set
him
in
a
fair
and
lovely
world
surrounded
him
with
things
good
and
beautiful
and
given
him
the
disposition
to
love
to
sympathize
to
help
to
produce
to
enjoy
and
thus
to
become
an
honourable
and
a
happy
being
bringing
god
work
to
perfection
and
enjoying
the
divine
creation
in
the
midst
of
which
he
lives
make
a
man
happy

his
actions
will
be
happy
too
doom
him
to
dismal
thoughts
and
miserable
circumstances
and
you
will
make
him
gloomy
discontented
morose
and
probably
vicious
hence
coarseness
and
crime
are
almost
invariably
found
amongst
those
who
have
never
been
accustomed
to
be
cheerful
whose
hearts
have
been
shut

purifying
influences
of
a
happy
communion
with
nature

an
enlightened
and
cheerful
intercourse
with
man
man
has
a
strong
natural
appetite
for
relaxation
and
amusement
and
like
all
other
natural
appetites
it
has
been
implanted
for
a
wise
purpose
it
can
not
be
repressed
but
will
break
out
in
one
form
or
another
any
attempt
to
promote
an
innocent
amusement
is
worth
a
dozen
sermons
against
pernicious
ones
if
we
do
not
provide
the
opportunity
for
enjoying
wholesome
pleasures
men
will
certainly
find
out
vicious
ones
for
themselves

truly
said
in

to
attack
vice
with
effect
we
must
set
up
something
better

place
temperance

have
not
sufficiently
considered
how
much
the

the
consequences
of
gross
tastes

of

limited
opportunities
which
exist

obtaining

the
gratification
of

pleasure
and
when
he

it

immoderately
in

the

by

music
has
a

humanizing
effect
the
cultivation
of
the
art
has
a
most
favourable
influence
upon
public
morals
it

father
mathew
followed
up
his
temperance
movement
by
a
singing
movement
he
promoted
the
establishment
of
musical
clubs
all
over
ireland
for
he
felt
that
as
he
had
taken
the
people
whisky
from
them
he
must
give
them
some
wholesome
stimulus
in
its
stead
he
gave
them
music
singing
classes
were
established
to
refine
the
taste
soften
the
manners
and
humanize
the
mass
of
the
irish
people
but
we
fear
that
the
example
set
by
father
mathew
has
already
been
forgotten
what
a
fulness
of
enjoyment
says
channing
has
our
creator
placed
within
our
reach
by
surrounding
us
with
an
atmosphere
which
may
be
shaped
into
sweet
sounds
and
yet
this
goodness
is
almost
lost
upon
us
through
want
of
culture
of
the
organ
by
which
this
provision
is
to
be
enjoyed
how
much
would
the
general
cultivation
of
the
gift
of
music
improve
us
as
a
people
children
ought
to
learn
it
in
schools
as
they
do
in
germany
the
voice
of
music
would
then
be
heard
in
every
household
our
old
english
glees
would
no
longer
be
forgotten
men
and
women
might
sing
in
the
intervals
of
their
work
as
the
germans
do
in
going
to
and
coming
from
their
wars
the
work
would
not
be
worse
done
because
it
was
done
amidst
music
and
cheerfulness
the
breath
of
society
would
be
sweetened
and
pleasure
would
be
linked
with
labour
why
not
have
some
elegance
in
even
the
humblest
home
we
must
of
course
have
cleanliness
which
is
the
special
elegance
of
the
poor
but
why
not
have
pleasant
and
delightful
things
to
look
upon
there
is
no
reason
why
the
humbler
classes
should
not
surround
themselves
with
the
evidences
of
beauty
and
comfort
in
all
their
shapes
and
thus
do
homage
alike
to
the
gifts
of
god
and
the
labours
of
man
the
taste
for
the
beautiful
is
one
of
the
best
and
most
useful
endowments
it
is
one
of
the
handmaids
of
civilization
beauty
and
elegance
do
not
necessarily
belong
to
the
homes
of
the
rich
they
are
or
ought
to
be
beauty
in
all
things
in
nature
in
art
in
science
in
literature
in
social
and
domestic
life
how
beautiful
and
yet
how
cheap
are
flowers
not
exotics
but
what
are
called
common
flowers
a
rose
for
instance
is
among
the
most
beautiful
of
the
smiles
of
nature
the
laughing
flowers
exclaims
the
poet
but
there
is
more
than
gaiety
in
blooming
flowers
though
it
takes
a
wise
man
to
see
the
beauty
the
love
and
the
adaptation
of
which
they
are
full
what
should
we
think
of
one
who
had
flowers
supposing
that
before
him
flowers
were
unknown
would
he
not
be
regarded
as
the
of
a
paradise
of
new
delight
should
we
not
hail
the
inventor
as
a
genius
as
a
god
and
yet
these
lovely
offsprings
of
the
earth
have
been
speaking
to
man
from
the
first
dawn
of
his
existence
until
now
telling
him
of
the
goodness
and
wisdom
of
the
creative
power
which
bade
the
earth
bring
forth
not
only
that
which
was
useful
as
food
but
also
flowers
the
bright
consummate
flowers
to
clothe
it
in
beauty
and
joy
bring
one
of
the
commonest
into
a
room
place
it
on
a
table
or
chimneypiece
and
you
seem
to
have
brought
a
ray
of
sunshine
into
the
place
there
is
a
cheerfulness
about
flowers
what
a
delight
are
they
to
the
drooping
invalid
they
are
like
a
sweet
draught
of
enjoyment
coming
as
messengers
from
the
country
and
seeming
to
say
come
and
see
the
place
where
we
grow
and
let
your
heart
be
glad
in
our
presence
what
can
be
more
innocent
than
flowers
they
are
like
children
undimmed
by
sin
they
are
emblems
of
purity
and
truth
a
source
of
fresh
delight
to
the
pure
and
innocent
the
heart
that
does
not
love
flowers
or
the
voice
of
a
playful
child
can
not
be
genial
it
was
a
beautiful
conceit
that
invented
a
language
of
flowers
by
which
lovers
were
enabled
to
express
the
feelings
that
they
dared
not
openly
speak
but
flowers
have
a
voice
for
all
old
and
young
rich
and
poor
to
me
says
wordsworth
the
meanest
flower
that
blows
can
give
thoughts
that
do
often
lie
too
deep
for
tears
have
a
flower
in
the
room
by
all
means
it
will
cost
only
a
penny
if
your
ambition
is
moderate
and
the
gratification
it
gives
will
be
beyond
price
if
you
can
have
a
flower
for
your
window
so
much
the
better
what
can
be
more
delicious
than
the
sun
light
streaming
through
flowers
through
the
midst
of
crimson
fuchsias
or
scarlet
geraniums
to
look
out
into
the
light
through
flowers
is
not
that
poetry
and
to
break
the
force
of
the
sunbeams
by
the
tender
resistance
of
green
leaves
if
you
can
train
a
nasturtium
round
the
window
or
some
sweet
peas
then
you
will
have
the
most
beautiful
frame
you
can
invent
for
the
picture
without
whether
it
be
the
busy
crowd
or
a
distant
landscape
or
trees
with
their
lights
and
shades
or
the
changes
of
the
passing
clouds
any
one
may
thus
look
through
flowers
for
the
price
of
an
old
song
and
what
pure
taste
and
refinement
does
it
not
indicate
on
the
part
of
the
cultivator
a
flower
in
the
window
sweetens
the
air
makes
the
room
look
graceful
gives
the
sun
light
a
new
charm
rejoices
the
eye
and
links
nature
with
beauty
the
flower
is
a
companion
that
will
never
say
a
cross
thing
to
any
one
but
will
always
look
beautiful
and
smiling
do
not
despise
it
because
it
is
cheap
and
because
everybody
may
have
the
luxury
as
well
as
yourself
common
things
are
cheap
but
common
things
are
invariably
the
most
valuable
could
we
only
have
fresh
air
or
sunshine
by
purchase
what
luxuries
they
would
be
considered
but
they
are
free
to
all
and
we
think
little
of
their
blessings
there
is
indeed
much
in
nature
that
we
do
not
yet
half
enjoy
because
we
shut
our
avenues
of
sensation
and
feeling
we
are
satisfied
with
the
matter
of
fact
and
look
not
for
the
spirit
of
fact
which
is
above
it
if
we
opened
our
minds
to
enjoyment
we
might
find
tranquil
pleasures
spread
about
us
on
every
side
we
might
live
with
the
angels
that
visit
us
on
every
sunbeam
and
sit
with
the
fairies
who
wait
on
every
flower
we
want
more
loving
knowledge
to
enable
us
to
enjoy
life
and
we
require
to
cultivate
the
art
of
making
the
most
of
the
common
means
and
appliances
for
enjoyment
which
lie
about
us
on
every
side
a
snug
and
a
clean
home
no
matter
how
tiny
it
be
so
that
it
be
wholesome
windows
into
which
the
sun
can
shine
cheerily
a
few
good
books
and
who
need
be
without
a
few
good
books
in
these
days
of
universal
cheapness
no
duns
at
the
door
and
the
cupboard
well
supplied
and
with
a
flower
in
your
room
there
is
none
so
poor
as
not
to
have
about
him
these
elements
of
pleasure
but
why
not
besides
the
beauty
of
nature
have
a
taste
for
the
beauty
of
art
why
not
hang
up
a
picture
in
the
room
ingenious
methods
have
been
discovered
some
of
them
quite
recently
for
almost
infinitely
multiplying
works
of
art
by
means
of
wood
engravings
lithographs
photographs
and
autotypes
which
render
it
possible
for
every
person
to
furnish
his
rooms
with
beautiful
pictures
skill
and
science
have
thus
brought
art
within
reach
of
the
poorest
any
picture
print
or
engraving
that
represents
a
noble
thought
that
depicts
a
heroic
act
or
that
brings
a
bit
of
nature
from
the
fields
or
the
streets
into
our
room
is
a
teacher
a
means
of
education
and
a
help
to
it
serves
to
make
the
home
more
pleasant
and
attractive
it
sweetens
domestic
life
and
sheds
a
grace
and
beauty
about
it
it
draws
the
gazer
away
from
mere
considerations
of
self
and
increases
his
store
of
delightful
associations
with
the
world
without
as
well
as
with

the
portrait
of

personal
interest
looking
at
his
features
we
feel
as
if
we
knew
him
better
and
were
more
closely
related
to
him
such
a
portrait
hung
up
before
us
daily
at
our
meals
and
during
our
leisure
hours
unconsciously
serves
to
lift
us
up
and
sustain
us
it
is
a
link
that
in
some
way
binds
us
to
a
higher
and
nobler
nature
it
is
said
of
a
catholic
that
when
about
to
cheat
he
was
wont
to
draw
a
veil
over
the
face
of
his
favourite
saint
thus
the
portraiture
of
a
great
and
virtuous
man
is
in
some
measure
a
companionship
of
something
better
than
ourselves
and
though
we
may
not
reach
the
standard
of
the
hero
we
may
to
a
certain
extent
be
influenced
by
his
likeness
on
our
walls
it
is
not
necessary
that
a
picture
should
be
in
order
to
be
beautiful
and
good
we
have
seen
things
for
which
hundreds
of
guineas
have
been
paid
that
have
not
part
of
the
meaning
or
beauty
that
is
to
be
found
in
linton
woodcut
of
rafaelle
madonna
which
may
be
had
for
twopence
the
head
reminds
one
of
the
observation
made
by
hazlitt
upon
a
picture
that
it
seems
as
if
an
unhandsome
act
would
be
impossible
in
its
presence
it
embodies
the
ideas
of
love
womanly
beauty
and
earnest
piety
as
some
one
said
of
the
picture
it
looks
as
if
a
bit
of
heaven
were
in
the
room
pay
not
so
much
for
the
merit
as
for
the
age
and
the
rarity
of
their
works
the
poorest
may
have
the
for
beauty
while
the
rich
man
may
be
blind
to
it
the
cheapest
engraving
may
communicate
the
sense
of
beauty
to
the
artizan
while
the
picture
may
fail
to
communicate
to
the
millionaire
anything
excepting
perhaps
the
notion
that
he
has
got
possession
of
a
work
which
the
means
of
other
people
can
not
compass
does
the
picture
give
you
pleasure
on
looking
at
it
that
is
one
good
test
of
its
worth
you
may
grow
tired
of
it
your
taste
may
outgrow
it
and
demand
something
better
just
as
the
reader
may
grow
out
of
montgomery
poetry
into
milton
then
you
will
take
down
the
daub
and
put
up
a
picture
with
a
higher
idea
in
its
place
there
may
thus
be
a
steady
progress
of
art
made
upon
the
room
walls
if
the
pictures
can
be
put
in
frames
so
much
the
better
but
if
they
can
not
no
matter
up
with
them
we
know
that
owen
jones
says
it
is
not
good
taste
to
hang
prints
upon
walls
he
would
merely
hang
room
papers
there
but
owen
jones
may
not
be
infallible
and
here
we
think
he
is
wrong
to
our
eyes
a
room
always
looks
unfurnished
no
matter
how
costly
and
numerous
the
tables
chairs
and
ottomans
unless
there
be
pictures
upon
the
walls
it
ought
to
be
and
no
doubt
it
is
a
great
stimulus
to
artists
to
know
that
their
works
are
now
distributed
in
prints
and
engravings
to
decorate
and
beautify
the
homes
of
the
people
the
the
lithographer
and
the
engraver
are
the
popular
interpreters
of
the
great
artist
thus
turner
pictures
are
not
confined
to
the
wealthy
possessors
of
the
original
works
but
may
be
diffused
through
all
homes
by
the
millars
and
brandards
and
wilmotts
who
have
engraved
them
thus
landseer
finds
entrance
through
woodcuts
and
mezzotints
into
every
dwelling
thus
cruikshank
preaches
temperance
and
ary
scheffer
purity
and
piety
the
engraver
is
the
medium
by
which
art
in
the
palace
is
conveyed
into
the
humblest
homes
in
the
kingdom
the
art
of
living
may
be
displayed
in
many
ways
it
may
be
summed
up
in
the
words
make
the
best
of
everything
nothing
is
beneath
its
care
even
common
and
little
things
it
turns
to
account
it
gives
a
brightness
and
grace
to
the
home
and
invests
nature
with
new
charms
through
it
we
enjoy
the
rich
man
parks
and
woods
as
if
they
were
our
own
we
inhale
the
common
air
and
bask
under
the
universal
sunshine
we
glory
in
the
grass
the
passing
clouds
and
the
flowers
we
love
the
common
earth
and
hear
joyful
voices
through
all
nature
it
extends
to
every
kind
of
social
intercourse
it
engenders
cheerful
goodwill
and
loving
sincerity
by
its
help
we
make
others
happy
and
ourselves
blest
we
elevate
our
being
and
ennoble
our
lot
we
rise
above
the
grovelling
creatures
of
earth
and
aspire
to
the
infinite
and
thus
we
link
time
to
eternity
where
the
true
art
of
living
has
its
final
consummation
