bobby
broke
away
and
down
this
hill
it
kited
the
careless
nurse
screamed
in
dismay
but
bobby
was
delighted
he
clapped
his
hands
in
manner
rude
and
laughed
in
high
elation
while
close
behind
the
nurse
pursued
in
hopeless
consternation

an
officer
slid
off
the
lid
as
bobby
hove
in
sight
and
bellowed
out

a
funny
son
of
sunny
greece
was
standing
near
the

naught
could
well
disturb
but
all
at
once
he
got
a
shock

with
his
fancy
stock
and
littered
up
the
town

swerved
a
bit
and
snapped
a
hydrant

which
accident
proved
quite
a
hit
of
rather

sort

and
brown
was
chugging
up
the
hill
and
met

plunging
down

there
rose
a
noise
and
din
of
people
in
dismay

opened
up
a
way

a
lad
was
rushing

the
swift
and
dextrous
contrived
to
muss
him
up
a
bit
and
fill
the
air
with
extras
one
copy
bobby
neatly
scooped
and
saw
this
wild
display
in
type
so
bold
it
fairly
whooped
a
breaks
away

then
as
the
speeded
by
a
bulldog
quite
pugnacious
seized
on
the
handle
on
the
fly
and
clung
with
grip
tenacious
the
speed
was
so
increased
the
dog
streamed
out
behind
it
and
bobby
turned
to
pet
the
beast
which
did
seem
to
mind
it

down
the
street
was
miss

knocked
her
off

stubborn
jade
and
lunged
about
unheeding
the
caught

rope
midway
between
the
calf
and

and
both
fell
in
behind
the
shay
with
cries

and
murder

two
chappies
at
a
tennis
meet
were
battling
fast
and
hard
the
skidded
off
the
street
and
shot
across
the
yard
the
game
was
forty
all
but
then
it
did
end
that
day
the
dashed
into
the
net
and
carried
it
away
illustration
on
came
the
down
the
grade
the
town
was
now
behind
it
and
ran
into
an
orchard
shade
where
providence
resigned
it
but
then
it
only
grazed
a
tree
and
set
it
all
the
ripened
fruit
fell
merrily
and
likewise
sammy
sliver
illustration
then
through
a
watermelon
patch
this
awful
cart
descended
and
split
the
melons
by
the
batch
the
farmer
was
offended
and
tried
to
stop
its
wild
career
which
was
a
silly
notion
it
passed
him
promptly
to
the
rear
with
quite
a
rapid
motion

a
picnic
party
on
the
green

seated
at
their
lunch

upon
the
scene
and
through
the
happy
bunch
sardines
and
pickles
ham
and
cake
were
jumbled
in
a
mess
then
straightway
rose
these
picnickers
and
shouted
for
redress

an
artist
sketching
on
the
slope
a
lively
air
was
humming
and
so
absorbed
was
he
he
failed
to
note
the
coming
a
crash
the
circumambient
air
was
filled
with
miscellany
and
damaged
quite
beyond
repair

damsel
milked
a
brindled
cow
out
in
a
pasture

the
birdies
sang
from
bush
and
bough
all
nature
was
serene
when
suddenly
a
thunderbolt
dispelled
the
sweet
illusion
the
gave
the
twain
a
jolt
and
all
was
wild
confusion
illustration
upon
a
rustic
bridge
a
chap
cast
out
a
bait
inviting
and
presently
he
took
a
nap
and
dreamed
the
fish
were
biting
then
came
the
like
a
gale
and
rudely
him
awakened
at
first
he
thought
he
caught
a
whale
but
found
he
was
mistaken
illustration
the
longest
night
must
have
an
end
as
well
as
a
beginning
and
so
this
cart
you
may
depend
was
bound
to
cease
its
spinning
it
crashed
into
a
hemlock
stump
that
chanced
to
block
its
way
and
bobby
made
a
flying
jump
and
landed
in
the
hay
