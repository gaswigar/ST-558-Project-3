eminent
victorians
by
lytton
strachey
preface
the
history
of
the
victorian
age
will
never
be
written
we
know
too
much
about
it
for
ignorance
is
the
first
requisite
of
the
historian
ignorance
which
simplifies
and
clarifies
which
selects
and
omits
with
a
placid
perfection
unattainable
by
the
highest
art
concerning
the
age
which
has
just
passed
our
fathers
and
our
grandfathers
have
poured
forth
and
accumulated
so
vast
a
quantity
of
information
that
the
industry
of
a
ranke
would
be
submerged
by
it
and
the
perspicacity
of
a
gibbon
would
quail
before
it
it
is
not
by
the
direct
method
of
a
scrupulous
narration
that
the
explorer
of
the
past
can
hope
to
depict
that
singular
epoch
if
he
is
wise
he
will
adopt
a
subtler
strategy
he
will
attack
his
subject
in
unexpected
places
he
will
fall
upon
the
flank
or
the
rear
he
will
shoot
a
sudden
revealing
searchlight
into
obscure
recesses
hitherto
undivined
he
will
row
out
over
that
great
ocean
of
material
and
lower
down
into
it
here
and
there
a
little
bucket
which
will
bring
up
to
the
light
of
day
some
characteristic
specimen
from
those
far
depths
to
be
examined
with
a
careful
curiosity
guided
by
these
considerations
i
have
written
the
ensuing
studies
i
have
attempted
through
the
medium
of
biography
to
present
some
victorian
visions
to
the
modern
eye
they
are
in
one
sense
haphazard
visions
that
is
to
say
my
choice
of
subjects
has
been
determined
by
no
desire
to
construct
a
system
or
to
prove
a
theory
but
by
simple
motives
of
convenience
and
of
art
it
has
been
my
purpose
to
illustrate
rather
than
to
explain
it
would
have
been
futile
to
hope
to
tell
even
a
precis
of
the
truth
about
the
victorian
age
for
the
shortest
precis
must
fill
innumerable
volumes
but
in
the
lives
of
an
ecclesiastic
an
educational
authority
a
woman
of
action
and
a
man
of
adventure
i
have
sought
to
examine
and
elucidate
certain
fragments
of
the
truth
which
took
my
fancy
and
lay
to
my
hand
i
hope
however
that
the
following
pages
may
prove
to
be
of
interest
from
the
strictly
biographical
no
less
than
from
the
historical
point
of
view
human
beings
are
too
important
to
be
treated
as
mere
symptoms
of
the
past
they
have
a
value
which
is
independent
of
any
temporal
processes
which
is
eternal
and
must
be
felt
for
its
own
sake
the
art
of
biography
seems
to
have
fallen
on
evil
times
in
england
we
have
had
it
is
true
a
few
masterpieces
but
we
have
never
had
like
the
french
a
great
biographical
tradition
we
have
had
no
fontenelles
and
condorcets
with
their
incomparable
eloges
compressing
into
a
few
shining
pages
the
manifold
existences
of
men
with
us
the
most
delicate
and
humane
of
all
the
branches
of
the
art
of
writing
has
been
relegated
to
the
journeymen
of
letters
we
do
not
reflect
that
it
is
perhaps
as
difficult
to
write
a
good
life
as
to
live
one
those
two
fat
volumes
with
which
it
is
our
custom
to
commemorate
the
dead
who
does
not
know
them
with
their
masses
of
material
their
slipshod
style
their
tone
of
tedious
panegyric
their
lamentable
lack
of
selection
of
detachment
of
design
they
are
as
familiar
as
the
cortege
of
the
undertaker
and
wear
the
same
air
of
slow
funereal
barbarism
one
is
tempted
to
suppose
of
some
of
them
that
they
were
composed
by
that
functionary
as
the
final
item
of
his
job
the
studies
in
this
book
are
indebted
in
more
ways
than
one
to
such
works
works
which
certainly
deserve
the
name
of
standard
biographies
for
they
have
provided
me
not
only
with
much
indispensable
information
but
with
something
even
more
precious
an
example
how
many
lessons
are
to
be
learned
from
them
but
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
particularise
to
preserve
for
instance
a
becoming
brevity
a
brevity
which
excludes
everything
that
is
redundant
and
nothing
that
is
significant
that
surely
is
the
first
duty
of
the
biographer
the
second
no
less
surely
is
to
maintain
his
own
freedom
of
spirit
it
is
not
his
business
to
be
complimentary
it
is
his
business
to
lay
bare
the
facts
of
the
case
as
he
understands
them
that
is
what
i
have
aimed
at
in
this
book
to
lay
bare
the
facts
of
some
cases
as
i
understand
them
dispassionately
impartially
and
without
ulterior
intentions
to
quote
the
words
of
a
master
rien
je
ne
propose
rien
a
list
of
the
principal
sources
from
which
i
have
drawn
is
appended
to
each
biography
i
would
indicate
as
an
honourable
exception
to
the
current
commodity
sir
edward
cook
excellent
life
of
florence
nightingale
without
which
my
own
study
though
composed
on
a
very
different
scale
and
from
a
decidedly
different
angle
could
not
have
been
written
cardinal
manning
henry
edward
manning
was
born
in
and
died
in
his
life
was
extraordinary
in
many
ways
but
its
interest
for
the
modern
inquirer
depends
mainly
upon
two
considerations
the
light
which
his
career
throws
upon
the
spirit
of
his
age
and
the
psychological
problems
suggested
by
his
inner
history
he
belonged
to
that
class
of
eminent
ecclesiastics
and
it
is
by
no
means
a
small
class
who
have
been
distinguished
less
for
saintliness
and
learning
than
for
practical
ability
had
he
lived
in
the
middle
ages
he
would
certainly
have
been
neither
a
francis
nor
an
aquinas
but
he
might
have
been
an
innocent
as
it
was
born
in
the
england
of
the
nineteenth
century
growing
up
in
the
very
of
modern
progress
coming
to
maturity
with
the
first
onrush
of
liberalism
and
living
long
enough
to
witness
the
victories
of
science
and
democracy
he
yet
by
a
strange
concatenation
of
circumstances
seemed
almost
to
revive
in
his
own
person
that
long
line
of
diplomatic
and
administrative
clerics
which
one
would
have
thought
had
come
to
an
end
for
ever
with
cardinal
wolsey
in
manning
so
it
appeared
the
middle
ages
lived
again
the
tall
gaunt
figure
with
the
face
of
smiling
asceticism
the
robes
and
the
biretta
as
it
passed
in
triumph
from
high
mass
at
the
oratory
to
philanthropic
gatherings
at
exeter
hall
from
strike
committees
at
the
docks
to
mayfair
where
fashionable
ladies
knelt
to
the
prince
of
the
church
certainly
bore
witness
to
a
singular
condition
of
affairs
what
had
happened
had
a
dominating
character
imposed
itself
upon
a
hostile
environment
or
was
the
nineteenth
century
after
all
not
so
hostile
was
there
something
in
it
scientific
and
progressive
as
it
was
which
went
out
to
welcome
the
representative
of
ancient
tradition
and
uncompromising
faith
had
it
perhaps
a
place
in
its
heart
for
such
as
manning
a
soft
place
one
might
almost
say
or
on
the
other
hand
was
it
he
who
had
been
supple
and
yielding
he
who
had
won
by
art
what
he
would
never
have
won
by
force
and
who
had
managed
so
to
speak
to
be
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
procession
less
through
merit
than
through
a
superior
faculty
for
gliding
adroitly
to
the
front
rank
and
in
any
case
by
what
odd
chances
what
shifts
and
struggles
what
combinations
of
circumstance
and
character
had
this
old
man
come
to
be
where
he
was
such
questions
are
easier
to
ask
than
to
answer
but
it
may
be
instructive
and
even
amusing
to
look
a
little
more
closely
into
the
complexities
of
so
curious
a
story
i
undoubtedly
what
is
most
obviously
striking
in
the
history
of
career
is
the
persistent
strength
of
his
innate
characteristics
through
all
the
changes
of
his
fortunes
the
powerful
spirit
of
the
man
worked
on
undismayed
it
was
as
if
the
fates
had
laid
a
wager
that
they
would
daunt
him
and
in
the
end
they
lost
their
bet
his
father
was
a
rich
west
indian
merchant
a
governor
of
the
bank
of
england
a
member
of
parliament
who
drove
into
town
every
day
from
his
country
seat
in
a
coach
and
four
and
was
content
with
nothing
short
of
a
bishop
for
the
christening
of
his
children
little
henry
like
the
rest
had
his
bishop
but
he
was
obliged
to
wait
for
him
for
as
long
as
eighteen
months
in
those
days
and
even
a
generation
later
as
keble
bears
witness
there
was
great
laxity
in
regard
to
the
early
baptism
of
children
the
delay
has
been
noted
by
manning
biographer
as
the
first
in
the
spiritual
life
of
the
future
cardinal
but
he
surmounted
it
with
success
his
father
was
more
careful
in
other
ways
refinement
and
delicacy
of
mind
were
such
wrote
manning
long
afterwards
i
never
heard
out
of
his
mouth
a
word
which
might
not
have
been
spoken
in
the
presence
of
the
most
pure
and
sensitive
except
he
adds
one
occasion
he
was
then
forced
by
others
to
repeat
a
negro
story
which
though
free
from
all
evil
de
sexu
was
indelicate
he
did
it
with
great
resistance
his
example
gave
me
a
hatred
of
all
such
talk
the
family
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
evangelical
piety
one
day
the
little
boy
came
in
from
the
farmyard
and
his
mother
asked
him
whether
he
had
seen
the
peacock
said
yes
and
the
nurse
said
no
and
my
mother
made
me
kneel
down
and
beg
god
to
forgive
me
for
not
speaking
the
truth
at
the
age
of
four
the
child
was
told
by
a
cousin
of
the
age
of
six
that
had
a
book
in
which
he
wrote
down
everything
we
did
wrong
this
so
terrified
me
for
days
that
i
remember
being
found
by
my
mother
sitting
under
a
kind
of
in
great
fear
i
never
forgot
this
at
any
time
in
my
life
the
cardinal
tells
us
it
has
been
a
great
grace
to
me
when
he
was
nine
years
old
he
the
apocalypse
and
i
never
all
through
my
life
forgot
the
lake
that
burneth
with
fire
and
brimstone
that
verse
has
kept
me
like
an
audible
voice
through
all
my
life
and
through
worlds
of
danger
in
my
youth
at
harrow
the
worlds
of
danger
were
already
around
him
but
yet
he
listened
to
the
audible
voice
school
and
college
i
never
failed
to
say
my
prayers
so
far
as
memory
serves
me
even
for
a
day
and
he
underwent
another
religious
experience
he
read
paley
evidences
took
in
the
whole
argument
wrote
manning
when
he
was
over
seventy
i
thank
god
that
nothing
has
ever
shaken
it
yet
on
the
whole
he
led
the
unspiritual
life
of
an
ordinary
schoolboy
we
have
glimpses
of
him
as
a
handsome
lad
playing
cricket
or
strutting
about
in
tasselled
hessian
and
on
one
occasion
at
least
he
gave
proof
of
a
certain
dexterity
of
conduct
which
deserved
to
be
remembered
he
went
out
of
bounds
and
a
master
riding
by
and
seeing
him
on
the
other
side
of
a
field
tied
his
horse
to
a
gate
and
ran
after
him
the
astute
youth
outran
the
master
fetched
a
circle
reached
the
gate
jumped
on
to
the
horse
back
and
rode
off
for
this
he
was
very
properly
chastised
but
of
what
use
was
chastisement
no
whipping
however
severe
could
have
eradicated
from
little
henry
mind
a
quality
at
least
as
firmly
planted
in
it
as
his
fear
of
hell
and
his
belief
in
the
arguments
of
paley
it
had
been
his
father
wish
that
manning
should
go
into
the
church
but
the
thought
disgusted
him
and
when
he
reached
oxford
his
tastes
his
ambitions
his
successes
at
the
union
all
seemed
to
mark
him
out
for
a
political
career
he
was
a
year
junior
to
samuel
wilberforce
and
a
year
senior
to
gladstone
in
those
days
the
union
was
the
for
young
politicians
ministers
came
down
from
london
to
listen
to
the
debates
and
a
few
years
later
the
duke
of
newcastle
gave
gladstone
a
pocket
borough
on
the
strength
of
his
speech
at
the
union
against
the
reform
bill
to
those
three
young
men
indeed
the
whole
world
lay
open
were
they
not
rich
and
endowed
with
an
infinite
capacity
for
making
speeches
the
event
justified
the
highest
expectations
of
their
friends
for
the
least
distinguished
of
the
three
died
a
bishop
the
only
danger
lay
in
another
direction
my
dear
samuel
wrote
the
elder
wilberforce
to
his
son
with
jealousy
whether
you
find
yourself
unduly
solicitous
about
acquitting
yourself
whether
you
are
too
much
chagrined
when
you
fail
or
are
puffed
up
by
your
success
undue
solicitude
about
popular
estimation
is
a
weakness
against
which
all
real
christians
must
guard
with
the
utmost
jealous
watchfulness
the
more
you
can
retain
the
impression
of
your
being
surrounded
by
a
cloud
of
witnesses
of
the
invisible
world
to
use
the
scripture
phrase
the
more
you
will
be
armed
against
this
besetting
sin
but
suddenly
it
seemed
as
if
such
a
warning
could
after
all
have
very
little
relevance
to
manning
for
on
his
leaving
oxford
the
brimming
cup
was
dashed
from
his
lips
he
was
already
beginning
to
dream
of
himself
in
the
house
of
commons
the
solitary
advocate
of
some
great
cause
whose
triumph
was
to
be
eventually
brought
about
by
his
extraordinary
efforts
when
his
father
was
declared
a
bankrupt
and
all
his
hopes
of
a
political
career
came
to
an
end
forever
it
was
at
this
time
that
manning
became
intimate
with
a
pious
lady
the
sister
of
one
of
his
college
friends
whom
he
used
to
describe
as
his
spiritual
mother
he
made
her
his
confidante
and
one
day
as
they
walked
together
in
the
shrubbery
he
revealed
the
bitterness
of
the
disappointment
into
which
his
father
failure
had
plunged
him
she
tried
to
cheer
him
and
then
she
added
that
there
were
higher
aims
open
to
him
which
he
had
not
considered
do
you
mean
he
asked
kingdom
of
heaven
she
answered
ambitions
are
not
closed
against
you
the
young
man
listened
was
silent
and
said
at
last
that
he
did
not
know
but
she
was
right
she
suggested
reading
the
bible
together
and
they
accordingly
did
so
during
the
whole
of
that
vacation
every
morning
after
breakfast
yet
in
spite
of
these
devotional
exercises
and
in
spite
of
a
voluminous
correspondence
on
religious
subjects
with
his
spiritual
mother
manning
still
continued
to
indulge
in
secular
hopes
he
entered
the
colonial
office
as
a
supernumerary
clerk
and
it
was
only
when
the
offer
of
a
merton
fellowship
seemed
to
depend
upon
his
taking
orders
that
his
heavenly
ambitions
began
to
assume
a
definite
shape
just
then
he
fell
in
love
with
miss
deffell
whose
father
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
a
young
man
without
prospects
and
forbade
him
the
house
it
was
only
too
true
what
were
the
prospects
of
a
supernumerary
clerk
in
the
colonial
office
manning
went
to
oxford
and
took
orders
he
was
elected
to
the
merton
fellowship
and
obtained
through
the
influence
of
the
wilberforces
a
curacy
in
sussex
at
the
last
moment
he
almost
drew
back
think
the
whole
step
has
been
too
precipitate
he
wrote
to
his
have
rather
allowed
the
instance
of
my
friends
and
the
allurements
of
an
agreeable
curacy
in
many
respects
to
get
the
better
of
my
sober
judgment
his
vast
ambitions
his
dreams
of
public
service
of
honours
and
of
power
was
all
this
to
end
in
a
little
country
curacy
in
many
respects
but
there
was
nothing
for
it
the
deed
was
done
and
the
fates
had
apparently
succeeded
very
effectively
in
getting
rid
of
manning
all
he
could
do
was
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
business
accordingly
in
the
first
place
he
decided
that
he
had
received
a
call
from
god
veritatem
et
ad
seipsum
and
in
the
second
forgetting
miss
deffell
he
married
his
rector
daughter
within
a
few
months
the
rector
died
and
manning
stepped
into
his
shoes
and
at
least
it
could
be
said
that
the
shoes
were
not
uncomfortable
for
the
next
seven
years
he
fulfilled
the
functions
of
a
country
clergyman
he
was
energetic
and
devout
he
was
polite
and
handsome
his
fame
grew
in
the
diocese
at
last
he
began
to
be
spoken
of
as
the
probable
successor
to
the
old
archdeacon
of
chichester
when
manning
prematurely
died
he
was
at
first
inconsolable
but
he
found
relief
in
the
distraction
of
redoubled
work
how
could
he
have
guessed
that
one
day
he
would
come
to
number
that
loss
among
special
mercies
yet
so
it
was
to
be
in
after
years
the
memory
of
his
wife
seemed
to
be
blotted
from
his
mind
he
never
spoke
of
her
every
letter
every
record
of
his
married
life
he
destroyed
and
when
word
was
sent
to
him
that
her
grave
was
falling
into
ruin
is
best
so
the
cardinal
answered
it
be
time
effaces
all
things
but
when
the
grave
was
yet
fresh
the
young
rector
would
sit
beside
it
day
after
day
writing
his
sermons
ii
in
the
meantime
a
series
of
events
was
taking
place
in
another
part
of
england
which
was
to
have
a
no
less
profound
effect
upon
history
than
the
merciful
removal
of
his
wife
in
the
same
year
in
which
he
took
up
his
sussex
curacy
the
tracts
for
the
times
had
begun
to
appear
at
oxford
the
movement
in
fact
had
started
on
its
course
the
phrase
is
still
familiar
but
its
meaning
has
become
somewhat
obscured
both
by
the
lapse
of
time
and
the
intrinsic
ambiguity
of
the
subjects
connected
with
it
let
us
borrow
for
a
moment
the
wings
of
historic
imagination
and
hovering
lightly
over
the
oxford
of
the
thirties
take
a
rapid
view
for
many
generations
the
church
of
england
had
slept
the
sleep
of
the
comfortable
the
sullen
murmurings
of
dissent
the
loud
of
revolution
had
hardly
disturbed
her
slumbers
portly
divines
subscribed
with
a
sigh
or
a
smile
to
the
articles
sank
quietly
into
easy
living
rode
gaily
to
hounds
of
a
morning
as
gentlemen
should
and
as
gentlemen
should
carried
their
two
bottles
of
an
evening
to
be
in
the
church
was
in
fact
simply
to
pursue
one
of
those
professions
which
nature
and
society
had
decided
were
proper
to
gentlemen
and
gentlemen
alone
the
fervours
of
piety
the
zeal
of
apostolic
charity
the
enthusiasm
of
these
things
were
all
very
well
in
their
way
and
in
their
place
but
their
place
was
certainly
not
the
church
of
england
gentlemen
were
neither
fervid
nor
zealous
and
above
all
they
were
not
enthusiastic
there
were
it
was
true
occasionally
to
be
found
within
the
church
some
parsons
of
the
high
tory
school
who
looked
back
with
regret
to
the
days
of
laud
or
talked
of
the
apostolical
succession
and
there
were
groups
of
evangelicals
who
were
earnest
over
the
atonement
confessed
to
a
personal
love
of
jesus
christ
and
seemed
to
have
arranged
the
whole
of
their
lives
down
to
the
minutest
details
of
act
and
speech
with
reference
to
eternity
but
such
extremes
were
the
rare
exceptions
the
great
bulk
of
the
clergy
walked
calmly
along
the
smooth
road
of
ordinary
duty
they
kept
an
eye
on
the
poor
of
the
parish
and
they
conducted
the
sunday
services
in
a
becoming
manner
for
the
rest
they
differed
neither
outwardly
nor
inwardly
from
the
great
bulk
of
the
laity
to
whom
the
church
was
a
useful
organisation
for
the
maintenance
of
religion
as
by
law
established
the
awakening
came
at
last
however
and
it
was
a
rude
one
the
liberal
principles
of
the
french
revolution
checked
at
first
in
the
terrors
of
reaction
began
to
make
their
way
into
england
rationalists
lifted
up
their
heads
bentham
and
the
mills
propounded
utilitarianism
the
reform
bill
was
passed
and
there
were
rumours
abroad
of
disestablishment
even
churchmen
seemed
to
have
caught
the
infection
whately
was
so
bold
as
to
assert
that
in
the
interpretation
of
scripture
different
opinions
might
be
permitted
upon
matters
of
doubt
and
arnold
drew
up
a
disquieting
scheme
for
allowing
dissenters
into
the
church
though
it
is
true
that
he
did
not
go
quite
so
far
as
to
contemplate
the
admission
of
unitarians
at
this
time
there
was
living
in
a
country
parish
a
young
clergyman
of
the
name
of
john
keble
he
had
gone
to
oxford
at
the
age
of
fifteen
where
after
a
successful
academic
career
he
had
been
made
a
fellow
of
oriel
he
had
then
returned
to
his
father
parish
and
taken
up
the
duties
of
a
curate
he
had
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
contents
of
the
the
ways
of
a
common
room
the
conjugations
of
the
greek
irregular
verbs
and
the
small
jests
of
a
country
parsonage
and
the
defects
of
his
experience
in
other
directions
were
replaced
by
a
zeal
and
a
piety
which
were
soon
to
prove
themselves
equal
and
more
than
equal
to
whatever
calls
might
be
made
upon
them
the
superabundance
of
his
piety
overflowed
into
verse
and
the
holy
simplicity
of
the
christian
year
carried
his
name
into
the
remotest
of
england
as
for
his
zeal
however
it
needed
another
outlet
looking
forth
upon
the
doings
of
his
through
his
rectory
windows
in
gloucestershire
keble
felt
his
whole
soul
shaken
with
loathing
anger
and
dread
infidelity
was
stalking
through
the
land
authority
was
laughed
at
the
hideous
doctrines
of
democracy
were
being
openly
preached
worse
still
if
possible
the
church
herself
was
ignorant
and
lukewarm
she
had
forgotten
the
mysteries
of
the
sacraments
she
had
lost
faith
in
the
apostolical
succession
she
was
no
longer
interested
in
the
early
fathers
and
she
submitted
herself
to
the
control
of
a
secular
legislature
the
members
of
which
were
not
even
bound
to
profess
belief
in
the
atonement
in
the
face
of
such
enormities
what
could
keble
do
he
was
ready
to
do
anything
but
he
was
a
simple
and
an
unambitious
man
and
his
wrath
would
in
all
probability
have
consumed
itself
unappeased
within
him
had
he
not
chanced
to
come
into
contact
at
the
critical
moment
with
a
spirit
more
excitable
and
daring
than
his
own
hurrell
froude
one
of
keble
pupils
was
a
clever
young
man
to
whom
had
fallen
a
rather
larger
share
of
and
intolerance
than
even
clever
young
men
usually
possess
what
was
singular
about
him
however
was
not
so
much
his
temper
as
his
tastes
the
sort
of
ardour
which
impels
more
normal
youths
to
haunt
music
halls
and
fall
in
love
with
actresses
took
the
form
in
froude
case
of
a
romantic
devotion
to
the
deity
and
an
intense
interest
in
the
state
of
his
own
soul
he
was
obsessed
by
the
ideals
of
saintliness
and
convinced
of
the
supreme
importance
of
not
eating
too
much
he
kept
a
diary
in
which
he
recorded
his
delinquencies
and
they
were
many
can
not
say
much
for
myself
today
he
writes
on
september
he
was
years
old
did
not
read
the
psalms
and
second
lesson
after
breakfast
which
i
had
neglected
to
do
before
though
i
had
plenty
of
time
on
my
hands
would
have
liked
to
be
thought
adventurous
for
a
scramble
i
had
at
the
devil
bridge
looked
with
greediness
to
see
if
there
was
a
goose
on
the
table
for
dinner
and
though
what
i
ate
was
of
the
plainest
sort
and
i
took
no
variety
yet
even
this
was
partly
the
effect
of
accident
and
i
certainly
rather
exceeded
in
quantity
as
i
was
fuzzy
and
sleepy
after
dinner
allowed
myself
to
be
disgusted
with
pomposity
he
writes
a
little
later
smiled
at
an
allusion
in
the
lessons
to
abstemiousness
in
eating
i
hope
not
from
pride
or
vanity
but
mistrust
it
certainly
was
unintentional
and
again
to
my
meals
i
can
say
that
i
was
always
careful
to
see
that
no
one
else
would
take
a
thing
before
i
served
myself
and
i
believe
as
to
the
kind
of
my
food
a
bit
of
cold
endings
of
a
dab
at
breakfast
and
a
scrap
of
mackerel
at
dinner
are
the
only
things
that
diverged
from
the
strict
rule
of
simplicity
am
obliged
to
confess
he
notes
in
my
intercourse
with
the
supreme
being
i
am
be
come
more
and
more
sluggish
and
then
he
exclaims
eye
trieth
my
inward
parts
and
knoweth
my
thoughts
oh
that
my
ways
were
made
so
direct
that
i
might
keep
thy
statutes
i
will
walk
in
thy
commandments
when
thou
hast
set
my
heart
at
liberty
such
were
the
preoccupations
of
this
young
man
perhaps
they
would
have
been
different
if
he
had
had
a
little
less
of
what
newman
describes
as
his
severe
idea
of
the
intrinsic
excellence
of
virginity
but
it
is
useless
to
speculate
naturally
enough
the
fierce
and
burning
zeal
of
keble
had
a
profound
effect
upon
his
mind
the
two
became
intimate
friends
and
froude
eagerly
seizing
upon
the
doctrines
of
the
elder
man
saw
to
it
that
they
had
as
full
a
measure
of
controversial
notoriety
as
an
oxford
common
room
could
afford
he
plunged
the
metaphysical
mysteries
of
the
holy
catholic
church
into
the
atmosphere
of
party
politics
surprised
doctors
of
divinity
found
themselves
suddenly
faced
with
strange
questions
which
had
never
entered
their
heads
before
was
the
church
of
england
or
was
it
not
a
part
of
the
church
catholic
if
it
was
were
not
the
reformers
of
the
sixteenth
century
renegades
was
not
the
participation
of
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
christian
life
and
hope
in
each
individual
were
timothy
and
titus
bishops
or
were
they
not
if
they
were
did
it
not
follow
that
the
power
of
administering
the
holy
eucharist
was
the
attribute
of
a
sacred
order
founded
by
christ
himself
did
not
the
fathers
refer
to
the
tradition
of
the
church
as
to
something
independent
of
the
written
word
and
sufficient
to
refute
heresy
even
alone
was
it
not
therefore
unwritten
word
and
did
it
not
demand
the
same
reverence
from
us
as
the
scriptures
and
for
exactly
the
same
reason
because
it
was
his
word
the
doctors
of
divinity
were
aghast
at
such
questions
which
seemed
to
lead
they
hardly
knew
whither
and
they
found
it
difficult
to
think
of
very
apposite
answers
but
hurrell
froude
supplied
the
answers
himself
readily
enough
all
oxford
all
england
should
know
the
truth
the
time
was
out
of
joint
and
he
was
only
too
delighted
to
have
been
born
to
set
it
right
but
after
all
something
more
was
needed
than
even
the
excitement
of
froude
combined
with
the
conviction
of
keble
to
ruffle
seriously
the
vast
calm
waters
of
christian
thought
and
it
so
happened
that
that
thing
was
not
wanting
it
was
the
genius
of
john
henry
newman
if
newman
had
never
lived
or
if
his
father
when
the
gig
came
round
on
the
fatal
morning
still
undecided
between
the
two
universities
had
chanced
to
turn
the
horse
head
in
the
direction
of
cambridge
who
can
doubt
that
the
oxford
movement
would
have
flickered
out
its
little
flame
unobserved
in
the
common
room
of
oriel
and
how
different
too
would
have
been
the
fate
of
newman
himself
he
was
a
child
of
the
romantic
revival
a
creature
of
emotion
and
of
memory
a
dreamer
whose
secret
spirit
dwelt
apart
in
delectable
mountains
an
artist
whose
subtle
senses
caught
like
a
shower
in
the
sunshine
the
impalpable
rainbow
of
the
immaterial
world
in
other
times
under
other
skies
his
days
would
have
been
more
fortunate
he
might
have
helped
to
weave
the
garland
of
meleager
or
to
mix
the
lapis
lazuli
of
fra
angelico
or
to
chase
the
delicate
truth
in
the
shade
of
an
athenian
palaestra
or
his
hands
might
have
fashioned
those
ethereal
faces
that
smile
in
the
niches
of
chartres
even
in
his
own
age
he
might
at
cambridge
whose
cloisters
have
ever
been
consecrated
to
poetry
and
common
sense
have
followed
quietly
in
footsteps
and
brought
into
flower
those
seeds
of
inspiration
which
now
lie
embedded
amid
the
faded
devotion
of
the
lyra
apostolica
at
oxford
he
was
doomed
he
could
not
withstand
the
last
enchantment
of
the
middle
age
it
was
in
vain
that
he
plunged
into
the
pages
of
gibbon
or
communed
for
long
hours
with
beethoven
over
his
beloved
violin
the
air
was
thick
with
clerical
sanctity
heavy
with
the
odours
of
tradition
and
the
soft
warmth
of
spiritual
authority
his
friendship
with
hurrell
froude
did
the
rest
all
that
was
weakest
in
him
hurried
him
onward
and
all
that
was
strongest
in
him
too
his
curious
and
vaulting
imagination
began
to
construct
vast
philosophical
fabrics
out
of
the
writings
of
ancient
monks
and
to
dally
with
visions
of
angelic
visitations
and
the
efficacy
of
the
oil
of
st
walburga
his
emotional
nature
became
absorbed
in
the
partisan
passions
of
a
university
clique
and
his
subtle
intellect
concerned
itself
more
and
more
exclusively
with
the
dialectical
splitting
of
dogmatical
hairs
his
future
course
was
marked
out
for
him
all
too
clearly
and
yet
by
a
singular
chance
the
true
nature
of
the
man
was
to
emerge
triumphant
in
the
end
if
newman
had
died
at
the
age
of
sixty
today
he
would
have
been
already
forgotten
save
by
a
few
ecclesiastical
historians
but
he
lived
to
write
his
apologia
and
to
reach
immortality
neither
as
a
thinker
nor
as
a
theologian
but
as
an
artist
who
has
embalmed
the
poignant
history
of
an
intensely
human
spirit
in
the
magical
spices
of
words
when
froude
succeeded
in
impregnating
newman
with
the
ideas
of
keble
the
oxford
movement
began
the
original
and
remarkable
characteristic
of
these
three
men
was
that
they
took
the
christian
religion
au
pied
de
la
lettre
this
had
not
been
done
in
england
for
centuries
when
they
declared
every
sunday
that
they
believed
in
the
holy
catholic
church
they
meant
it
when
they
repeated
the
athanasian
creed
they
meant
it
even
when
they
subscribed
to
the
articles
they
meant
at
least
they
thought
they
did
now
such
a
state
of
mind
was
dangerous
more
dangerous
indeed
than
they
at
first
realised
they
had
started
with
the
innocent
assumption
that
the
christian
religion
was
contained
in
the
doctrines
of
the
church
of
england
but
the
more
they
examined
this
matter
the
more
difficult
and
dubious
it
became
the
church
of
england
bore
everywhere
upon
it
the
signs
of
human
imperfection
it
was
the
outcome
of
revolution
and
of
compromise
of
the
exigencies
of
politicians
and
the
caprices
of
princes
of
the
prejudices
of
theologians
and
the
necessities
of
the
state
how
had
it
happened
that
this
piece
of
patchwork
had
become
the
receptacle
for
the
august
and
infinite
mysteries
of
the
christian
faith
this
was
the
problem
with
which
newman
and
his
friends
found
themselves
confronted
other
men
might
and
apparently
did
see
nothing
very
strange
in
such
a
situation
but
other
men
saw
in
christianity
itself
scarcely
more
than
a
convenient
and
respectable
appendage
to
existence
by
which
a
sound
system
of
morals
was
inculcated
and
through
which
one
might
hope
to
attain
to
everlasting
bliss
to
newman
and
keble
it
was
otherwise
they
saw
a
transcendent
manifestation
of
divine
power
flowing
down
elaborate
and
immense
through
the
ages
a
consecrated
priesthood
stretching
back
through
the
mystic
symbol
of
the
laying
on
of
hands
to
the
very
godhead
a
whole
universe
of
spiritual
beings
brought
into
communion
with
the
eternal
by
means
of
wafers
a
great
mass
of
metaphysical
doctrines
at
once
incomprehensible
and
of
incalculable
import
laid
down
with
infinite
certitude
they
saw
the
supernatural
everywhere
and
at
all
times
a
living
force
floating
invisible
in
angels
inspiring
saints
and
investing
with
miraculous
properties
the
commonest
material
things
no
wonder
that
they
found
such
a
spectacle
hard
to
bring
into
line
with
the
institution
which
had
been
evolved
from
the
divorce
of
henry
viii
the
intrigues
of
elizabethan
parliaments
and
the
revolution
of
they
did
no
doubt
soon
satisfy
themselves
that
they
had
succeeded
in
this
apparently
hopeless
task
but
the
conclusions
which
they
came
to
in
order
to
do
so
were
decidedly
startling
the
church
of
england
they
declared
was
indeed
the
one
true
church
but
she
had
been
under
an
eclipse
since
the
reformation
in
fact
since
she
had
begun
to
exist
she
had
it
is
true
escaped
the
corruptions
of
rome
but
she
had
become
enslaved
by
the
secular
power
and
degraded
by
the
false
doctrines
of
protestantism
the
christian
religion
was
still
preserved
intact
by
the
english
priesthood
but
it
was
preserved
as
it
were
unconsciously
a
priceless
deposit
handed
down
blindly
from
generation
to
generation
and
subsisting
less
by
the
will
of
man
than
through
the
ordinance
of
god
as
expressed
in
the
mysterious
virtue
of
the
sacraments
christianity
in
short
had
become
entangled
in
a
series
of
unfortunate
circumstances
from
which
it
was
the
plain
duty
of
newman
and
his
friends
to
rescue
it
forthwith
what
was
curious
was
that
this
task
had
been
reserved
in
so
marked
a
manner
for
them
some
of
the
divines
of
the
seventeenth
century
had
perhaps
been
vouchsafed
glimpses
of
the
truth
but
they
were
glimpses
and
nothing
more
no
the
waters
of
the
true
faith
had
dived
underground
at
the
reformation
and
they
were
waiting
for
the
wand
of
newman
to
strike
the
rock
before
they
should
burst
forth
once
more
into
the
light
of
day
the
whole
matter
no
doubt
was
providential
what
other
explanation
could
there
be
the
first
step
it
was
clear
was
to
purge
the
church
of
her
shames
and
her
errors
the
reformers
must
be
exposed
the
yoke
of
the
secular
power
must
be
thrown
off
dogma
must
be
reinstated
in
its
old
and
christians
must
be
reminded
of
what
they
had
apparently
forgotten
the
presence
of
the
supernatural
in
daily
life
would
be
a
gain
to
this
country
keble
observed
it
vastly
more
superstitious
more
bigoted
more
gloomy
more
fierce
in
its
religion
than
at
present
it
shows
itself
to
be
only
good
i
know
of
cranmer
said
hurrell
froude
that
he
burned
well
newman
preached
and
soon
the
new
views
began
to
spread
among
the
earliest
of
the
converts
was
dr
pusey
a
man
of
wealth
and
learning
a
professor
a
canon
of
christ
church
who
had
it
was
rumoured
been
to
germany
then
the
tracts
for
the
times
were
started
under
newman
editorship
and
the
movement
was
launched
upon
the
world
the
tracts
were
written
the
hope
of
rousing
members
of
our
church
to
comprehend
her
alarming
position
as
a
man
might
give
notice
of
a
fire
or
inundation
to
startle
all
who
heard
him
they
may
be
said
to
have
succeeded
in
their
objective
for
the
sensation
which
they
caused
among
clergymen
throughout
the
country
was
extreme
they
dealt
with
a
great
variety
of
questions
but
the
underlying
intention
of
all
of
them
was
to
attack
the
accepted
doctrines
and
practices
of
the
church
of
england
pusey
wrote
learnedly
on
baptismal
regeneration
he
also
wrote
on
fasting
his
treatment
of
the
latter
subject
met
with
considerable
disapproval
which
surprised
the
doctor
was
not
prepared
he
said
people
questioning
even
in
the
abstract
the
duty
of
fasting
i
thought
persons
at
least
supposed
they
practised
fasting
in
some
way
or
other
i
assumed
the
duty
to
be
acknowledged
and
thought
it
only
undervalued
we
live
and
learn
even
though
we
have
been
to
germany
other
tracts
discussed
the
holy
catholic
church
the
clergy
and
the
liturgy
one
treated
of
the
question
a
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
be
now
bound
to
have
morning
and
evening
prayers
daily
in
his
parish
church
another
pointed
out
the
of
a
superintending
providence
in
the
preservation
of
the
and
in
the
changes
which
it
has
undergone
another
consisted
of
a
collection
of
sermons
on
antichrist
keble
wrote
a
long
and
elaborate
tract
the
mysticism
attributed
to
the
early
fathers
of
the
church
in
which
he
expressed
his
opinions
upon
a
large
number
of
curious
matters
to
men
usual
way
of
talking
he
wrote
would
be
called
an
accidental
circumstance
that
there
were
five
loaves
not
more
nor
less
in
the
store
of
our
lord
and
his
disciples
wherewith
to
provide
the
miraculous
feast
but
the
ancient
interpreters
treat
it
as
designed
and
providential
in
this
surely
not
erring
and
their
conjecture
is
that
it
represents
the
sacrifice
of
the
whole
world
of
sense
and
especially
of
the
old
dispensation
which
being
outward
and
visible
might
be
called
the
dispensation
of
the
senses
to
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
to
be
a
pledge
and
means
of
communion
with
him
according
to
the
terms
of
the
new
or
evangelical
law
they
arrived
at
this
idea
by
considering
the
number
five
the
number
of
the
senses
as
the
mystical
opponent
of
the
visible
and
sensible
universe
ta
aistheta
as
distinguished
from
ta
noita
origen
lays
down
the
rule
in
express
terms
the
number
five
he
says
frequently
nay
almost
always
is
taken
for
the
five
senses
in
another
passage
keble
deals
with
an
even
more
recondite
question
he
quotes
the
teaching
of
barnabas
that
who
first
gave
men
circumcision
did
thereby
perform
a
spiritual
and
typical
action
looking
forward
to
the
son
barnabas
argument
is
as
follows
abraham
circumcised
of
his
house
men
to
the
number
of
why
observe
first
the
then
the
of
the
two
letters
which
stand
for
is
represented
by
by
hast
here
says
barnabas
word
of
jesus
as
for
the
cross
is
represented
by
tau
and
the
letter
tau
represents
that
number
unfortunately
however
barnabas
premise
was
of
doubtful
validity
as
the
rev
maitland
pointed
out
in
a
pamphlet
impugning
the
conclusions
of
the
tract
simple
fact
is
he
wrote
when
abraham
pursued
chedorlaomer
he
armed
his
trained
servants
born
in
his
own
house
three
hundred
and
eighteen
when
more
than
thirteen
according
to
the
common
chronology
fifteen
years
after
he
circumcised
all
the
men
of
his
house
born
in
the
house
and
bought
with
money
of
the
stranger
and
in
fact
every
male
who
was
as
much
as
eight
days
old
we
are
not
told
what
the
number
amounted
to
shall
we
suppose
just
for
the
sake
of
the
interpretation
that
abraham
family
had
so
dwindled
in
the
interval
as
that
now
all
the
males
of
his
household
trained
men
slaves
and
children
equalled
only
and
exactly
the
number
of
his
warriors
fifteen
years
before
the
question
seems
difficult
to
answer
but
keble
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
forestalled
the
argument
in
the
following
passage
which
had
apparently
escaped
the
notice
of
the
rev
maitland
whether
the
facts
were
really
so
or
not
if
it
were
it
was
surely
by
special
providence
that
abraham
household
at
the
time
of
the
circumcision
was
exactly
the
same
number
as
before
still
the
argument
of
barnabas
will
stand
as
thus
circumcision
had
from
the
beginning
a
reference
to
our
saviour
as
in
other
respects
so
in
this
that
the
mystical
number
which
is
the
cipher
of
jesus
crucified
was
the
number
of
the
first
circumcised
household
in
the
strength
of
which
abraham
prevailed
against
the
powers
of
the
world
so
clement
of
alexandria
as
cited
by
fell
and
keble
supports
his
contention
through
ten
pages
of
close
print
with
references
to
aristeas
augustine
jerome
and
whitby
writings
of
this
kind
could
not
fail
in
their
effect
pious
youths
in
oxford
were
carried
away
by
them
and
began
to
flock
around
the
standard
of
newman
newman
himself
became
a
party
chief
encouraging
organising
persuading
his
long
black
figure
swiftly
passing
through
the
streets
was
pointed
at
with
awe
crowds
flocked
to
his
sermons
his
words
were
repeated
from
mouth
to
mouth
in
newmannum
became
a
common
catchword
jokes
were
made
about
the
church
of
england
and
practices
unknown
for
centuries
began
to
be
revived
young
men
fasted
and
did
penance
recited
the
hours
of
the
roman
breviary
and
confessed
their
sins
to
pusey
nor
was
the
movement
confined
to
oxford
it
spread
in
widening
circles
through
the
parishes
of
england
the
dormant
devotion
of
the
country
was
suddenly
aroused
the
new
strange
notion
of
taking
christianity
literally
was
delightful
to
earnest
minds
but
it
was
also
alarming
really
to
mean
every
word
you
said
when
you
repeated
the
athanasian
creed
how
wonderful
and
what
enticing
and
mysterious
vistas
burst
upon
the
view
but
then
those
vistas
where
were
they
leading
supposing
oh
heavens
supposing
after
all
they
were
to
lead
to
iii
in
due
course
the
tracts
made
their
appearance
at
the
remote
rectory
in
sussex
manning
was
some
years
younger
than
newman
and
the
two
men
had
only
met
occasionally
at
the
university
but
now
through
common
friends
a
closer
relationship
began
to
grow
up
between
them
it
was
only
to
be
expected
that
newman
should
be
anxious
to
enroll
the
rising
young
rector
among
his
followers
and
on
manning
side
there
were
many
causes
which
impelled
him
to
accept
the
overtures
from
oxford
he
was
a
man
of
a
serious
and
vigorous
temperament
to
whom
it
was
inevitable
that
the
bold
high
principles
of
the
movement
should
strongly
appeal
there
was
also
an
element
in
his
mind
that
element
which
had
terrified
him
in
his
childhood
with
apocalyptic
visions
and
urged
him
in
his
youth
to
bible
readings
after
breakfast
which
now
brought
him
under
the
spell
of
the
oxford
theories
of
sacramental
mysticism
and
besides
the
movement
offered
another
attraction
it
imputed
an
extraordinary
transcendent
merit
to
the
profession
which
manning
himself
pursued
the
cleric
was
not
as
his
lay
brethren
he
was
a
creature
apart
chosen
by
divine
will
and
sanctified
by
divine
mysteries
it
was
a
relief
to
find
when
one
had
supposed
that
one
was
nothing
but
a
clergyman
that
one
might
after
all
be
something
else
one
might
be
a
priest
accordingly
manning
shook
off
his
early
evangelical
convictions
started
an
active
correspondence
with
newman
and
was
soon
working
for
the
new
cause
he
collected
quotations
and
began
to
translate
the
works
of
optatus
for
pusey
he
wrote
an
article
on
justin
for
the
british
critic
newman
magazine
he
published
a
sermon
on
faith
with
notes
and
appendices
which
was
condemned
by
an
evangelical
bishop
and
fiercely
attacked
by
no
less
a
person
than
the
celebrated
bowdler
sermon
said
mr
bowdler
in
a
book
which
he
devoted
to
the
subject
bad
enough
but
the
appendix
was
abominable
at
the
same
time
he
was
busy
asserting
the
independence
of
the
church
of
england
opposing
secular
education
and
bringing
out
pamphlets
against
the
ecclesiastical
commission
which
had
been
appointed
by
parliament
to
report
on
church
property
then
we
find
him
in
the
role
of
a
spiritual
director
of
souls
ladies
met
him
by
stealth
in
his
church
and
made
their
confessions
over
one
case
that
of
a
lady
who
found
herself
drifting
towards
rome
he
consulted
newman
newman
advised
him
to
upon
the
doctrine
of
i
cor
vii
i
think
you
must
press
on
her
the
prospect
of
benefiting
the
poor
church
through
which
she
has
her
baptism
by
stopping
in
it
does
she
not
care
for
the
souls
of
all
around
her
steeped
and
stifled
in
protestantism
how
will
she
best
care
for
them
by
indulging
her
own
feelings
in
the
communion
of
rome
or
in
denying
herself
and
staying
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
to
do
them
good
whether
these
arguments
were
successful
does
not
appear
for
several
years
after
his
wife
death
manning
was
occupied
with
these
new
activities
while
his
relations
with
newman
developed
into
what
was
apparently
a
warm
friendship
now
vive
valeque
my
dear
manning
we
find
newman
writing
in
a
letter
dated
festo
car
wishes
and
prays
yours
affectionately
john
newman
but
as
time
went
on
the
situation
became
more
complicated
tractarianism
began
to
arouse
the
hostility
not
only
of
the
evangelical
but
of
the
moderate
churchmen
who
could
not
help
perceiving
in
the
of
the
oxford
party
the
dread
approaches
of
rome
the
record
newspaper
an
influential
evangelical
journal
took
up
the
matter
and
sniffed
popery
in
every
direction
it
spoke
of
certain
clergymen
as
and
after
that
preferment
seemed
to
pass
those
clergymen
by
the
fact
that
manning
found
it
wise
to
conduct
his
confessional
ministrations
in
secret
was
in
itself
highly
significant
it
was
necessary
to
be
careful
and
manning
was
very
careful
indeed
the
neighbouring
archdeacon
hare
was
a
low
churchman
manning
made
friends
with
him
as
warmly
it
seemed
as
he
had
made
friends
with
newman
he
corresponded
with
him
asked
his
advice
about
the
books
he
should
read
and
discussed
questions
of
theology
to
gal
vi
we
can
not
differ
with
a
man
who
reads
and
reasons
i
can
have
no
controversy
and
you
do
both
archdeacon
hare
was
pleased
but
soon
a
rumour
reached
him
which
was
to
say
the
least
of
it
upsetting
manning
had
been
removing
the
high
pews
from
a
church
in
brighton
and
putting
in
open
benches
in
their
place
everyone
knew
what
that
meant
everyone
knew
that
a
high
pew
was
one
of
the
bulwarks
of
protestantism
and
that
an
open
bench
had
upon
it
the
taint
of
rome
but
manning
hastened
to
explain
dear
friend
he
wrote
did
not
exchange
pews
for
open
benches
but
got
the
pews
the
same
in
number
moved
from
the
nave
of
the
church
to
the
walls
of
the
side
aisles
so
that
the
whole
church
has
a
regular
arrangement
of
open
benches
which
irregularly
existed
before
i
am
not
today
quite
well
so
farewell
with
much
regard
yours
ever
archdeacon
hare
was
reassured
it
was
important
that
he
should
be
for
the
archdeacon
of
chichester
was
growing
very
old
and
hare
influence
might
be
exceedingly
useful
when
a
vacancy
occurred
so
indeed
it
fell
out
a
new
bishop
shuttleworth
was
appointed
to
the
see
and
the
old
archdeacon
took
the
opportunity
of
retiring
manning
was
obviously
marked
out
as
his
successor
but
the
new
bishop
happened
to
be
a
low
churchman
an
aggressive
low
churchman
who
went
so
far
as
to
parody
the
tractarian
fashion
of
using
saints
days
for
the
dating
of
letters
by
writing
palace
at
the
beginning
of
his
and
what
was
equally
serious
his
views
were
shared
by
shuttleworth
who
had
already
decided
that
the
pushing
young
rector
was
but
at
the
critical
moment
archdeacon
hare
came
to
the
rescue
he
persuaded
the
bishop
that
manning
was
safe
and
the
appointment
was
accordingly
made
behind
shuttleworth
back
she
was
furious
but
it
was
too
late
manning
was
an
archdeacon
all
the
lady
could
do
to
indicate
her
disapprobation
was
to
put
a
copy
of
bowdler
book
in
a
conspicuous
position
on
the
table
when
he
came
to
pay
his
respects
at
the
palace
among
the
letters
of
congratulation
which
manning
received
was
one
from
mr
gladstone
with
whom
he
had
remained
on
terms
of
close
friendship
since
their
days
together
at
oxford
rejoice
mr
gladstone
wrote
your
account
personally
but
more
for
the
sake
of
the
church
all
my
are
here
and
scarcely
less
delighted
than
i
am
with
great
glee
am
i
about
to
write
your
new
address
but
the
occasion
really
calls
for
higher
sentiments
and
sure
am
i
that
you
are
one
of
the
men
to
whom
it
is
specially
given
to
develop
the
solution
of
that
great
problem
how
all
our
minor
distractions
are
to
be
either
abandoned
absorbed
or
harmonised
through
the
might
of
the
great
principle
of
communion
in
the
body
of
christ
manning
was
an
archdeacon
but
he
was
not
yet
out
of
the
woods
his
relations
with
the
tractarians
had
leaked
out
and
the
record
was
beginning
to
be
suspicious
if
shuttleworth
opinion
of
him
were
to
become
general
it
would
certainly
be
a
grave
matter
nobody
could
wish
to
live
and
die
a
mere
archdeacon
and
then
at
that
very
moment
an
event
occurred
which
made
it
imperative
to
take
a
definite
step
one
way
or
the
other
that
event
was
the
publication
of
tract
no
for
some
time
it
had
been
obvious
to
every
impartial
onlooker
that
newman
was
slipping
down
an
inclined
plane
at
the
bottom
of
which
lay
one
thing
and
one
thing
only
the
roman
catholic
church
what
was
surprising
was
the
length
of
time
which
he
was
taking
to
reach
the
inevitable
destination
years
passed
before
he
came
to
realise
that
his
grandiose
edifice
of
a
church
universal
would
crumble
to
pieces
if
one
of
its
foundation
stones
was
to
be
an
amatory
intrigue
of
henry
viii
but
at
last
he
began
to
see
that
terrible
monarch
glowering
at
him
wherever
he
turned
his
eyes
first
he
tried
to
exorcise
the
spectre
with
the
rolling
periods
of
the
caroline
divines
but
it
only
strutted
the
more
truculently
then
in
despair
he
plunged
into
the
writings
of
the
early
fathers
and
sought
to
discover
some
way
out
of
his
difficulties
in
the
complicated
labyrinth
of
ecclesiastical
history
after
months
spent
in
the
study
of
the
monophysite
heresy
the
alarming
conclusion
began
to
force
itself
upon
him
that
the
church
of
england
was
perhaps
in
schism
eventually
he
read
an
article
by
a
roman
catholic
on
augustine
and
the
donatists
which
seemed
to
put
the
matter
beyond
doubt
augustine
in
the
fifth
century
had
pointed
out
that
the
donatists
were
heretics
because
the
bishop
of
rome
had
said
so
the
argument
was
crushing
it
rang
in
newman
ears
for
days
and
nights
and
though
he
continued
to
linger
on
in
agony
for
six
years
more
he
never
could
discover
any
reply
to
it
all
he
could
hope
to
do
was
to
persuade
himself
and
anyone
else
who
liked
to
listen
to
him
that
the
holding
of
anglican
orders
was
not
inconsistent
with
a
belief
in
the
whole
cycle
of
roman
doctrine
as
laid
down
at
the
council
of
trent
in
this
way
he
supposed
that
he
could
at
once
avoid
the
deadly
sin
of
heresy
and
conscientiously
remain
a
clergyman
in
the
church
of
england
and
with
this
end
in
view
he
composed
tract
no
the
object
of
the
tract
was
to
prove
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
articles
incompatible
with
the
creed
of
the
roman
church
newman
pointed
out
for
instance
that
it
was
generally
supposed
that
the
articles
condemned
the
doctrine
of
purgatory
but
they
did
not
they
merely
condemned
the
romish
doctrine
of
purgatory
and
romish
clearly
was
not
the
same
thing
as
roman
hence
it
followed
that
believers
in
the
roman
doctrine
of
purgatory
might
subscribe
the
articles
with
a
good
conscience
similarly
the
articles
condemned
sacrifices
of
masses
but
they
did
not
condemn
sacrifice
of
the
mass
thus
the
mass
might
be
lawfully
celebrated
in
english
churches
newman
took
the
trouble
to
examine
the
articles
in
detail
from
this
point
of
view
and
the
conclusion
he
came
to
in
every
case
supported
his
contention
in
a
singular
manner
the
tract
produced
an
immense
sensation
for
it
seemed
to
be
a
deadly
and
treacherous
blow
aimed
at
the
very
heart
of
the
church
of
england
deadly
it
certainly
was
but
it
was
not
so
treacherous
as
it
appeared
at
first
sight
the
members
of
the
english
church
had
ingenuously
imagined
up
to
that
moment
that
it
was
possible
to
contain
in
a
frame
of
words
the
subtle
essence
of
their
complicated
doctrinal
system
involving
the
mysteries
of
the
eternal
and
the
infinite
on
the
one
hand
and
the
elaborate
adjustments
of
temporal
government
on
the
other
they
did
not
understand
that
verbal
definitions
in
such
a
case
will
only
perform
their
functions
so
long
as
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
matters
which
they
are
intended
to
define
that
is
to
say
so
long
as
there
is
no
need
for
them
for
generations
this
had
been
the
case
with
the
articles
their
drift
was
clear
enough
and
nobody
bothered
over
their
exact
meaning
but
directly
someone
found
it
important
to
give
them
a
new
and
untraditional
interpretation
it
appeared
that
they
were
a
mass
of
ambiguity
and
might
be
twisted
into
meaning
very
nearly
anything
that
anybody
liked
churchmen
were
appalled
and
outraged
when
they
saw
newman
in
tract
no
performing
this
operation
but
after
all
he
was
only
taking
the
church
of
england
at
its
word
and
indeed
since
newman
showed
the
way
the
operation
has
become
so
exceedingly
common
that
the
most
churchman
hardly
raises
an
eyebrow
at
it
now
at
the
time
however
newman
treatment
of
the
articles
seemed
to
display
not
only
a
perverted
supersubtlety
of
intellect
but
a
temper
of
mind
that
was
fundamentally
dishonest
it
was
then
that
he
first
began
to
be
assailed
by
those
charges
of
untruthfulness
which
reached
their
culmination
more
than
twenty
years
later
in
the
celebrated
controversy
with
charles
kingsley
which
led
to
the
writing
of
the
apologia
the
controversy
was
not
a
very
fruitful
one
chiefly
because
kingsley
could
no
more
understand
the
nature
of
newman
intelligence
than
a
subaltern
in
a
line
regiment
can
understand
a
brahmin
of
benares
kingsley
was
a
stout
protestant
whose
hatred
of
popery
was
at
bottom
simply
ethical
an
honest
instinctive
horror
of
the
practices
of
priestcraft
and
the
habits
of
superstition
and
it
was
only
natural
that
he
should
see
in
those
innumerable
delicate
distinctions
which
newman
was
perpetually
drawing
and
which
he
himself
had
not
only
never
thought
of
but
could
not
even
grasp
simply
another
manifestation
of
the
inherent
falsehood
of
rome
but
in
reality
no
one
in
one
sense
of
the
word
was
more
truthful
than
newman
the
idea
of
deceit
would
have
been
abhorrent
to
him
and
indeed
it
was
owing
to
his
very
desire
to
explain
what
he
had
in
his
mind
exactly
and
completely
with
all
the
refinements
of
which
his
subtle
brain
was
capable
that
persons
such
as
kingsley
were
puzzled
into
thinking
him
dishonest
unfortunately
however
the
possibilities
of
truth
and
falsehood
depend
upon
other
things
besides
sincerity
a
man
may
be
of
a
scrupulous
and
impeccable
honesty
and
yet
his
respect
for
the
truth
it
can
not
be
denied
may
be
insufficient
he
may
be
like
the
lunatic
the
lover
and
the
poet
imagination
all
compact
he
may
be
blessed
or
cursed
with
one
of
those
brains
one
of
those
fanatasies
that
more
than
cool
reason
ever
comprehends
he
may
be
by
nature
incapable
of
sifting
evidence
or
by
predilection
simply
indisposed
to
do
so
we
were
there
wrote
newman
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
after
his
conversion
describing
a
visit
to
naples
and
the
miraculous
circumstances
connected
with
the
liquefaction
of
januarius
blood
feast
of
gennaro
was
coming
on
and
the
jesuits
were
eager
for
us
to
stop
they
have
the
utmost
confidence
in
the
miracle
and
were
the
more
eager
because
many
catholics
till
they
have
seen
it
doubt
it
our
father
director
here
tells
us
that
before
he
went
to
naples
he
did
not
believe
it
that
is
they
have
vague
ideas
of
natural
means
exaggeration
not
of
course
imputing
fraud
they
say
conversions
often
take
place
in
consequence
it
is
exposed
for
the
octave
and
the
miracle
continues
it
is
not
simple
liquefaction
but
sometimes
it
swells
sometimes
boils
sometimes
melts
no
one
can
tell
what
is
going
to
take
place
they
say
it
is
quite
people
can
not
help
crying
to
see
it
i
understand
that
sir
davy
attended
everyday
and
it
was
this
extreme
variety
of
the
phenomenon
which
convinced
him
that
nothing
physical
would
account
for
it
yet
there
is
this
remarkable
fact
that
liquefactions
of
blood
are
common
at
naples
and
unless
it
is
irreverent
to
the
great
author
of
miracles
to
be
obstinate
in
the
inquiry
the
question
certainly
rises
whether
there
is
something
in
the
air
mind
i
do
believe
there
is
and
speaking
humbly
and
without
having
seen
it
think
it
a
true
miracle
but
i
am
arguing
we
saw
the
blood
of
st
patrizia
half
liquid
liquefying
on
her
feast
day
st
john
baptist
blood
sometimes
liquefies
on
the
of
august
and
did
when
we
were
at
naples
but
we
had
not
time
to
go
to
the
church
we
saw
the
liquid
blood
of
an
oratorian
father
a
good
man
but
not
a
saint
who
died
two
centuries
ago
i
think
and
we
saw
the
liquid
blood
of
da
ponte
the
great
and
holy
jesuit
who
i
suppose
was
almost
a
saint
but
these
instances
do
not
account
for
liquefaction
on
certain
days
if
this
is
the
case
but
the
most
strange
phenomenon
is
what
happens
at
ravello
a
village
or
town
above
amalfi
there
is
the
blood
of
pantaleon
it
is
in
a
vessel
amid
the
stonework
of
the
is
not
touched
but
on
his
feast
in
june
it
liquefies
and
more
there
is
an
excommunication
against
those
who
bring
portions
of
the
true
cross
into
the
church
why
because
the
blood
liquefies
whenever
it
is
brought
a
person
i
know
not
knowing
the
prohibition
brought
in
a
portion
and
the
priest
suddenly
said
who
showed
the
blood
who
has
got
the
holy
cross
about
him
i
tell
you
what
was
told
me
by
a
grave
and
religious
man
it
is
a
curious
coincidence
that
in
telling
this
to
our
father
director
here
he
said
why
we
have
a
portion
of
pantaleon
blood
at
the
chiesa
nuova
and
it
is
always
liquid
after
leaving
naples
newman
visited
loreto
and
inspected
the
house
of
the
holy
family
which
as
is
known
to
the
faithful
was
transported
thither
in
three
hops
from
palestine
went
to
loreto
he
wrote
a
simple
faith
believing
what
i
still
more
believed
when
i
saw
it
i
have
no
doubt
now
if
you
ask
me
why
i
believe
it
it
is
because
everyone
believes
it
at
rome
cautious
as
they
are
and
sceptical
about
some
other
things
i
have
no
antecedent
difficulty
in
the
matter
he
who
floated
the
ark
on
the
surges
of
a
sea
and
enclosed
in
it
all
living
things
who
has
hidden
the
terrestrial
paradise
who
said
that
faith
might
move
mountains
who
sustained
thousands
for
forty
years
in
a
sterile
wilderness
who
transported
elias
and
keeps
him
hidden
till
the
end
could
do
this
wonder
also
here
whatever
else
there
may
be
there
is
certainly
no
trace
of
a
desire
to
deceive
could
a
state
of
mind
in
fact
be
revealed
with
more
absolute
transparency
when
newman
was
a
child
he
that
he
could
believe
the
arabian
nights
were
true
when
he
came
to
be
a
man
his
wish
seems
to
have
been
granted
tract
no
was
officially
condemned
by
the
authorities
at
oxford
and
in
the
hubbub
that
followed
the
contending
parties
closed
their
ranks
henceforward
any
compromise
between
the
friends
and
the
enemies
of
the
movement
was
impossible
archdeacon
manning
was
in
too
conspicuous
a
position
to
be
able
to
remain
silent
he
was
obliged
to
declare
himself
and
he
did
not
hesitate
in
an
archidiaconal
charge
delivered
within
a
few
months
of
his
appointment
he
firmly
repudiated
the
tractarians
but
the
repudiation
was
not
deemed
sufficient
and
a
year
later
he
repeated
it
with
greater
emphasis
still
however
the
horrid
rumours
were
afloat
the
record
began
to
investigate
matters
and
its
vigilance
was
soon
rewarded
by
an
alarming
discovery
the
sacrament
had
been
administered
in
chichester
cathedral
on
a
weekday
and
manning
one
of
the
most
noted
and
determined
of
the
tractarians
had
acted
a
conspicuous
part
on
the
occasion
it
was
clear
that
the
only
way
of
silencing
these
malevolent
whispers
was
by
some
public
demonstration
whose
import
nobody
could
doubt
the
annual
sermon
preached
on
guy
fawkes
day
before
the
university
of
oxford
seemed
to
offer
the
very
opportunity
that
manning
required
he
seized
it
got
himself
appointed
preacher
and
delivered
from
the
pulpit
of
a
virulently
protestant
harangue
this
time
there
could
indeed
be
no
doubt
about
the
matter
manning
had
shouted
popery
in
the
very
citadel
of
the
movement
and
every
one
including
newman
recognised
that
he
had
finally
cut
himself
off
from
his
old
friends
everyone
that
is
to
say
except
the
archdeacon
himself
on
the
day
after
the
sermon
manning
walked
out
to
the
neighbouring
village
of
littlemore
where
newman
was
now
living
in
retirement
with
a
few
chosen
disciples
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
give
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
what
he
had
done
but
he
was
disappointed
for
when
after
an
awkward
interval
one
of
the
disciples
appeared
at
the
door
he
was
informed
that
newman
was
not
at
home
with
his
retirement
to
littlemore
newman
had
entered
upon
the
final
period
of
his
anglican
career
even
he
could
no
longer
help
perceiving
that
the
end
was
now
only
a
matter
of
time
his
progress
was
hastened
in
an
agitating
manner
by
the
indiscreet
activity
of
one
of
his
proselytes
ward
a
young
man
who
combined
an
extraordinary
aptitude
for
a
priori
reasoning
with
a
passionate
devotion
to
opera
bouffe
it
was
difficult
in
fact
to
decide
whether
the
inner
nature
of
ward
was
more
truly
expressing
itself
when
he
was
firing
off
some
train
of
scholastic
paradoxes
on
the
eucharist
or
when
he
was
trilling
the
airs
of
figaro
and
plunging
through
the
hilarious
roulades
of
the
largo
al
factotum
even
pusey
could
not
be
quite
sure
though
he
was
ward
spiritual
director
on
one
occasion
his
young
penitent
came
to
him
and
confessed
that
a
vow
which
he
had
taken
to
abstain
from
music
during
lent
was
beginning
to
affect
his
health
could
pusey
see
his
way
to
releasing
him
from
the
vow
the
doctor
decided
that
a
little
sacred
music
would
not
be
amiss
ward
was
all
gratitude
and
that
night
a
party
was
arranged
in
a
friend
rooms
the
concert
began
with
the
solemn
harmonies
of
handel
which
were
followed
by
the
holy
strains
of
the
salutaris
of
cherubini
then
came
the
elevation
and
the
pomp
of
numi
from
the
magic
flute
but
alas
there
lies
much
danger
in
mozart
the
page
was
turned
and
there
was
the
delicious
duet
between
papageno
and
papagena
flesh
and
blood
could
not
resist
that
then
song
followed
song
the
music
waxed
faster
and
lighter
until
at
last
ward
burst
into
the
intoxicating
merriment
of
the
largo
al
factotum
when
it
was
over
a
faint
but
persistent
knocking
made
itself
heard
upon
the
wall
and
it
was
only
then
that
the
company
remembered
that
the
rooms
next
door
were
pusey
the
same
entrainment
which
carried
ward
away
when
he
sat
down
to
a
piano
possessed
him
whenever
he
embarked
on
a
religious
discussion
thing
that
was
utterly
abhorrent
to
him
said
one
of
his
friends
to
stop
short
given
the
premises
he
would
follow
out
their
implications
with
the
mercilessness
of
a
medieval
monk
and
when
he
had
reached
the
last
limits
of
argument
be
ready
to
maintain
whatever
propositions
he
might
find
there
with
his
dying
breath
he
had
the
extreme
innocence
of
a
child
and
a
mathematician
captivated
by
the
glittering
eye
of
newman
he
swallowed
whole
the
supernatural
conception
of
the
universe
which
newman
had
evolved
accepted
it
as
a
fundamental
premise
and
at
once
to
deduce
from
it
whatsoever
there
might
be
to
be
deduced
his
very
first
deductions
included
irrefutable
proofs
of
i
particular
providence
for
individuals
the
real
efficacy
of
intercessory
prayer
the
reality
of
our
communion
with
the
saints
departed
the
constant
presence
and
assistance
of
the
angels
of
god
later
on
he
explained
mathematically
the
importance
of
the
ember
days
can
tell
he
added
degree
of
blessing
lost
to
us
in
this
land
by
neglecting
as
we
alone
of
christian
churches
do
neglect
these
holy
days
he
then
proceeded
to
convict
the
reformers
not
only
of
rebellion
but
for
my
own
part
i
see
not
how
we
can
avoid
adding
of
perjury
every
day
his
arguments
became
more
extreme
more
rigorously
exact
and
more
distressing
to
his
master
newman
was
in
the
position
of
a
cautious
being
hurried
into
an
engagement
against
his
will
by
a
dashing
cavalry
officer
ward
forced
him
forward
step
by
step
he
could
not
bear
it
he
shuddered
and
drew
back
but
it
was
of
no
avail
in
vain
did
keble
and
pusey
wring
their
hands
and
stretch
forth
their
pleading
arms
to
their
now
vanishing
brother
the
fatal
moment
was
fast
approaching
ward
at
last
published
a
devastating
book
in
which
he
proved
conclusively
by
a
series
of
syllogisms
that
the
only
proper
course
for
the
church
of
england
was
to
repent
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
her
separation
from
the
communion
of
rome
the
reckless
author
was
deprived
of
his
degree
by
an
outraged
university
and
a
few
weeks
later
was
received
into
the
catholic
church
newman
in
a
kind
of
despair
had
flung
himself
into
the
labours
of
historical
compilation
his
views
of
history
had
changed
since
the
days
when
as
an
undergraduate
he
had
feasted
on
the
worldly
pages
of
gibbon
religion
he
now
thought
facts
to
other
sciences
which
those
sciences
left
to
themselves
would
never
reach
thus
in
the
science
of
history
the
preservation
of
our
race
in
noah
ark
is
an
historical
fact
which
history
never
would
arrive
at
without
revelation
with
these
principles
to
guide
him
he
plunged
with
his
disciples
into
a
prolonged
study
of
the
english
saints
biographies
soon
appeared
of
bega
adamnan
gundleus
guthlake
brother
drithelm
amphibalus
wuistan
ebba
neot
ninian
and
cunibert
the
hermit
their
austerities
their
virginity
and
their
miraculous
powers
were
described
in
detail
the
public
learned
with
astonishment
that
st
ninian
had
turned
a
staff
into
a
tree
that
german
had
stopped
a
cock
from
crowing
and
that
a
child
had
been
raised
from
the
dead
to
convert
helier
the
series
has
subsequently
been
continued
by
a
more
modern
writer
whose
relation
of
the
history
of
the
blessed
mael
contains
perhaps
even
more
matter
for
edification
than
biographies
at
the
time
indeed
those
works
caused
considerable
scandal
clergymen
denounced
them
in
pamphlets
cuthbert
was
described
by
his
biographer
as
having
the
jealousy
of
women
characteristic
of
all
the
saints
to
an
extraordinary
pitch
an
example
was
given
whenever
he
held
a
spiritual
conversation
with
st
ebba
he
was
careful
to
spend
the
ensuing
ours
of
darkness
prayer
up
to
his
neck
in
water
who
invent
such
tales
wrote
one
indignant
commentator
very
grave
and
just
suspicions
on
the
purity
of
their
own
minds
and
young
persons
who
talk
and
think
in
this
way
are
in
extreme
danger
of
falling
into
sinful
habits
as
to
the
volumes
before
us
the
authors
have
in
their
fanatical
panegyrics
of
virginity
made
use
of
language
downright
profane
one
of
the
disciples
at
littlemore
was
james
anthony
froude
the
younger
brother
of
hurrell
and
it
fell
to
his
lot
to
be
responsible
for
the
biography
of
neot
while
he
was
composing
it
he
began
to
feel
some
qualms
saints
who
lighted
fires
with
icicles
changed
bandits
into
wolves
and
floated
across
the
irish
channel
on
produced
a
disturbing
effect
on
his
historical
conscience
but
he
had
promised
his
services
to
newman
and
he
determined
to
carry
through
the
work
in
the
spirit
in
which
he
had
begun
it
he
did
so
but
he
thought
it
proper
to
add
the
following
sentence
by
way
of
conclusion
is
all
and
indeed
rather
more
than
all
that
is
known
to
men
of
the
blessed
neot
but
not
more
than
is
known
to
the
angels
in
heaven
meanwhile
the
english
roman
catholics
were
growing
impatient
was
the
great
conversion
never
coming
for
which
they
had
prayed
so
fervently
and
so
long
wiseman
at
the
head
of
them
was
watching
and
waiting
with
special
eagerness
his
hand
was
held
out
under
the
ripening
fruit
the
delicious
morsel
seemed
to
be
trembling
on
its
stalk
and
yet
it
did
not
fall
at
last
unable
to
bear
the
suspense
any
longer
he
dispatched
to
littlemore
father
smith
an
old
pupil
of
newman
who
had
lately
joined
the
roman
communion
with
instructions
that
he
should
do
his
best
under
cover
of
a
simple
visit
of
friendship
to
discover
how
the
land
lay
father
smith
was
received
somewhat
coldly
and
the
conversation
ran
entirely
on
topics
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
religion
when
the
company
separated
before
dinner
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
his
errand
had
been
useless
but
on
their
reassembling
he
suddenly
noticed
that
newman
had
changed
his
trousers
and
that
the
colour
of
the
pair
which
he
was
now
wearing
was
grey
at
the
earliest
moment
the
emissary
rushed
back
to
wiseman
is
well
he
exclaimed
no
longer
considers
that
he
is
in
anglican
orders
praise
be
to
god
answered
dr
wiseman
how
do
you
know
father
smith
described
what
he
had
seen
is
that
all
my
dear
father
how
can
you
be
so
foolish
but
father
smith
was
not
to
be
shaken
know
the
man
he
said
and
i
know
what
it
means
will
come
and
he
will
come
soon
and
father
smith
was
right
a
few
weeks
later
newman
suddenly
slipped
off
to
a
priest
and
all
was
over
perhaps
he
would
have
hesitated
longer
still
if
he
could
have
foreseen
how
he
was
to
pass
the
next
thirty
years
of
his
unfortunate
existence
but
the
future
was
hidden
and
all
that
was
certain
was
that
the
past
had
gone
forever
and
that
his
eyes
would
rest
no
more
upon
the
snapdragons
of
trinity
the
oxford
movement
was
now
ended
the
university
breathed
such
a
sigh
of
relief
as
usually
follows
the
difficult
expulsion
of
a
hard
piece
of
matter
from
a
living
organism
and
actually
began
to
attend
to
education
as
for
the
church
of
england
she
had
tasted
blood
and
it
was
clear
that
she
would
never
again
be
content
with
a
vegetable
diet
her
clergy
however
maintained
their
reputation
for
judicious
compromise
for
they
followed
newman
up
to
the
very
point
beyond
which
his
conclusions
were
logical
and
while
they
intoned
confessed
swung
incense
and
burned
candles
with
the
exhilaration
of
converts
they
yet
managed
to
do
so
with
a
subtle
nuance
which
showed
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
rome
various
individuals
underwent
more
violent
changes
several
had
preceded
newman
into
the
roman
fold
among
others
an
unhappy
sibthorpe
who
subsequently
changed
his
mind
and
returned
to
the
church
of
his
fathers
and
then
perhaps
it
was
only
natural
changed
his
mind
again
many
more
followed
newman
and
wiseman
was
particularly
pleased
by
the
conversion
of
a
morris
who
as
he
said
was
author
of
the
essay
which
won
the
prize
on
the
best
method
of
proving
christianity
to
the
hindus
hurrell
froude
had
died
before
newman
had
read
the
fatal
article
on
augustine
but
his
brother
james
anthony
together
with
arthur
clough
the
poet
went
through
an
experience
which
was
more
distressing
in
those
days
than
it
has
since
become
they
lost
their
faith
with
this
difference
however
that
while
in
froude
case
the
loss
of
his
faith
turned
out
to
be
rather
like
the
loss
of
a
heavy
portmanteau
which
one
afterwards
discovers
to
have
been
full
of
old
rags
and
brickbats
clough
was
made
so
uneasy
by
the
loss
of
his
that
he
went
on
looking
for
it
everywhere
as
long
as
he
lived
but
somehow
he
never
could
find
it
on
the
other
hand
keble
and
pusey
continued
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
to
dance
in
an
exemplary
manner
upon
the
of
high
anglicanism
in
such
an
exemplary
manner
indeed
that
the
has
its
dancers
still
iv
manning
was
now
and
it
was
clear
that
he
was
the
rising
man
in
the
church
of
england
he
had
many
powerful
connections
he
was
the
of
samuel
wilberforce
who
had
been
lately
made
a
bishop
he
was
a
close
friend
of
gladstone
who
was
a
cabinet
minister
and
he
was
becoming
well
known
in
the
influential
circles
of
society
in
london
his
talent
for
affairs
was
recognised
not
only
in
the
church
but
in
the
world
at
large
and
he
busied
himself
with
matters
of
such
varied
scope
as
national
education
the
administration
of
the
poor
law
and
the
employment
of
women
gladstone
kept
up
an
intimate
correspondence
with
him
on
these
and
on
other
subjects
mingling
in
his
letters
the
details
of
practical
statesmanship
with
the
speculations
of
a
religious
thinker
james
graham
he
wrote
in
a
discussion
of
the
bastardy
clauses
of
the
poor
law
much
pleased
with
the
tone
of
your
two
communications
he
is
disposed
without
putting
an
end
to
the
application
of
the
workhouse
test
against
the
mother
to
make
the
remedy
against
the
putative
father
real
and
effective
for
expenses
incurred
in
the
workhouse
i
am
not
enough
acquainted
to
know
whether
it
would
be
advisable
to
go
further
you
have
not
proposed
it
and
i
am
disposed
to
believe
that
only
with
a
revived
and
improved
discipline
in
the
church
can
we
hope
for
any
generally
effective
check
upon
lawless
lust
agree
with
you
eminently
he
writes
in
a
later
letter
your
doctrine
of
filtration
but
it
sometimes
occurs
to
me
though
the
question
may
seem
a
strange
one
how
far
was
the
reformation
but
especially
the
continental
reformation
designed
by
god
in
the
region
of
final
causes
for
that
purification
of
the
roman
church
which
it
has
actually
realised
in
his
archdeaconry
manning
lived
to
the
full
the
active
life
of
a
country
clergyman
his
slim
athletic
figure
was
seen
everywhere
in
the
streets
of
chichester
or
on
the
lawns
of
the
neighbouring
rectories
or
galloping
over
the
downs
in
breeches
and
gaiters
or
cutting
brilliant
figures
on
the
ice
he
was
an
excellent
judge
of
and
the
pair
of
greys
which
drew
his
hooded
phaeton
so
swiftly
through
the
lanes
were
the
admiration
of
the
county
his
features
were
already
beginning
to
assume
their
ascetic
cast
but
the
spirit
of
youth
had
not
yet
fled
from
them
so
that
he
seemed
to
combine
the
attractions
of
dignity
and
grace
he
was
a
good
talker
a
sympathetic
listener
a
man
who
understood
the
difficult
art
of
preserving
all
the
vigour
of
a
manly
character
and
yet
never
giving
offence
no
wonder
that
his
sermons
drew
crowds
no
wonder
that
his
spiritual
advice
was
sought
for
eagerly
by
an
group
of
penitents
no
wonder
that
men
would
say
when
his
name
was
mentioned
manning
no
power
on
earth
can
keep
him
from
a
bishopric
such
was
the
fair
outward
seeming
of
the
archdeacon
life
but
the
inward
reality
was
different
the
more
active
the
more
fortunate
the
more
full
of
happy
promise
his
existence
became
the
more
persistently
was
his
secret
imagination
haunted
by
a
dreadful
vision
the
lake
that
burneth
forever
with
brimstone
and
fire
the
temptations
of
the
evil
one
are
many
manning
knew
and
he
knew
also
that
for
him
at
least
the
most
subtle
and
terrible
of
all
temptations
was
the
temptation
of
worldly
success
he
tried
to
reassure
himself
but
it
was
in
vain
he
committed
his
thoughts
to
a
diary
weighing
scrupulously
his
every
motive
examining
with
relentless
searchings
into
the
depths
of
his
heart
perhaps
after
all
his
longings
for
preferment
were
merely
legitimatehopes
for
elevation
into
a
sphere
of
higher
usefulness
but
no
there
was
something
more
than
that
do
feel
pleasure
he
noted
honour
precedence
elevation
the
society
of
great
people
and
all
this
is
very
shameful
and
mean
after
newman
conversion
he
almost
convinced
himself
that
his
of
an
ecclesiastical
future
were
justified
by
the
role
that
he
would
play
as
a
of
the
breach
in
the
church
of
england
gladstone
agreed
with
him
but
there
was
one
higher
than
gladstone
and
did
he
agree
am
pierced
by
anxious
thoughts
god
knows
what
my
desires
have
been
and
are
and
why
they
are
crossed
i
am
flattering
myself
with
a
fancy
about
depth
and
reality
the
great
question
is
is
god
enough
for
you
now
and
if
you
are
as
now
even
to
the
end
of
life
will
it
suffice
you
certainly
i
would
rather
choose
to
be
stayed
on
god
than
to
be
in
the
thrones
of
the
world
and
the
church
nothing
else
will
go
into
eternity
in
a
moment
of
ambition
he
had
applied
for
the
readership
of
inn
but
owing
chiefly
to
the
hostile
influence
of
the
record
the
appointment
had
gone
elsewhere
a
little
later
a
more
important
position
was
offered
to
him
the
office
of
to
the
queen
which
had
just
been
vacated
by
the
archbishop
of
york
and
was
almost
certain
to
lead
to
a
mitre
the
offer
threw
manning
into
an
agony
of
he
drew
up
elaborate
tables
after
the
manner
of
robinson
crusoe
with
the
reasons
for
and
against
his
acceptance
of
the
post
for
against
that
it
comes
unsought
not
therefore
to
be
accepted
such
things
are
trials
as
well
as
leadings
that
it
is
honourable
being
what
i
am
ought
i
not
therefore
to
decline
it
as
humiliation
as
revenge
on
myself
for
lincoln
inn
as
a
testimony
and
so
on
he
found
in
the
end
ten
reasons
with
no
affirmative
ones
to
balance
them
and
after
a
week
deliberation
he
rejected
the
offer
but
peace
of
mind
was
as
far
off
from
him
as
ever
first
the
bitter
thought
came
to
him
that
all
this
satan
tells
me
i
am
doing
it
to
be
thought
mortified
and
holy
and
then
he
was
obsessed
by
the
still
bitterer
feelings
of
ineradicable
disappointment
and
regret
he
had
lost
a
great
opportunity
and
it
brought
him
small
comfort
to
consider
that
the
region
of
counsels
humiliation
penance
and
of
the
cross
he
had
perhaps
done
right
the
crisis
passed
but
it
was
succeeded
by
a
fiercer
one
manning
was
taken
seriously
ill
and
became
convinced
that
he
might
die
at
any
moment
the
entries
in
his
diary
grew
more
elaborate
than
ever
his
remorse
for
the
past
his
resolutions
for
the
future
his
protestations
of
submission
to
the
will
of
god
filled
page
after
page
of
parallel
columns
headings
and
numbered
clauses
and
analytical
tables
do
i
feel
about
death
he
wrote
great
fear
because
of
the
uncertainty
of
our
state
before
god
because
of
the
consciousness
of
great
sins
past
of
great
sinfulness
of
most
shallow
repentance
what
shall
i
do
he
decided
to
mortify
himself
to
read
st
thomas
aquinas
and
to
make
his
prayers
forty
instead
of
thirty
minutes
he
determined
during
lent
use
no
pleasant
bread
except
on
sundays
and
feasts
such
as
cake
and
sweetmeat
but
he
added
the
proviso
do
not
include
plain
biscuits
opposite
this
entry
appears
the
word
and
yet
his
were
many
looking
back
over
a
single
week
he
was
obliged
to
register
twice
and
visions
he
heard
his
curate
being
commended
for
bringing
so
many
souls
to
god
during
lent
and
he
not
bear
it
but
the
remorse
was
terrible
abhorred
myself
on
the
spot
and
looked
upward
for
help
he
made
out
list
upon
list
of
the
almighty
special
mercies
towards
him
and
they
included
his
creation
his
regeneration
and
no
preservation
of
my
life
six
times
to
my
knowledge
in
illness
at
the
age
of
nine
in
the
water
by
a
runaway
horse
at
oxford
by
the
same
by
falling
nearly
through
the
ceiling
of
a
church
again
by
a
fall
of
a
horse
and
i
know
not
how
often
in
shooting
riding
etc
at
last
he
became
convalescent
but
the
spiritual
experiences
of
those
agitated
weeks
left
an
indelible
mark
upon
his
mind
and
prepared
the
way
for
the
great
change
which
was
to
follow
for
he
had
other
doubts
besides
those
which
held
him
in
torment
as
to
his
own
salvation
he
was
in
doubt
about
the
whole
framework
of
his
faith
newman
conversion
he
found
had
meant
something
more
to
him
than
he
had
first
realised
it
had
seemed
to
come
as
a
call
to
the
redoubling
of
his
anglican
activities
but
supposing
in
reality
it
were
a
call
towards
something
very
different
towards
an
abandonment
of
those
activities
altogether
it
might
be
trial
or
again
it
might
be
a
how
was
he
to
judge
already
before
his
illness
these
doubts
had
begun
to
take
possession
of
his
mind
am
conscious
to
myself
he
wrote
in
his
diary
an
extensively
changed
feeling
towards
the
church
of
rome
the
church
of
england
seems
to
me
to
be
diseased
organically
six
functionally
seven
wherever
it
seems
healthy
it
approximates
the
system
of
rome
then
thoughts
of
the
virgin
mary
suddenly
began
to
assail
him
if
john
the
baptist
were
sanctified
from
the
womb
how
much
more
the
if
enoch
and
elijah
were
exempted
from
death
why
not
the
from
sin
it
is
a
strange
way
of
loving
the
son
to
slight
the
mother
the
arguments
seemed
irresistible
and
a
few
weeks
later
the
following
entry
occurs
thoughts
have
visited
me
i
have
felt
that
the
episcopate
of
the
church
of
england
is
secularised
and
bound
down
beyond
hope
i
feel
as
if
a
light
had
fallen
upon
me
my
feeling
about
the
roman
church
is
not
intellectual
i
have
intellectual
difficulties
but
the
great
moral
difficulties
seem
melting
something
keeps
rising
and
saying
you
will
end
in
the
roman
church
he
noted
altogether
of
these
thoughts
his
mind
hovered
anxiously
round
the
incarnation
the
real
presence
regeneration
ii
eucharist
and
the
exaltation
of
and
saints
his
strange
thought
was
as
follows
do
i
know
where
i
may
be
two
years
hence
where
was
newman
five
years
ago
it
was
significant
but
hardly
surprising
that
after
his
illness
manning
should
have
chosen
to
recuperate
in
rome
he
spent
several
months
there
and
his
diary
during
the
whole
of
that
period
is
concerned
entirely
with
detailed
descriptions
of
churches
ceremonies
and
relics
and
with
minute
accounts
of
conversations
with
priests
and
nuns
there
is
not
a
single
reference
either
to
the
objects
of
art
or
to
the
antiquities
of
the
place
but
another
omission
was
still
more
remarkable
manning
had
a
long
interview
with
pius
ix
and
his
only
record
of
it
is
contained
in
the
bald
statement
today
at
the
vatican
precisely
what
passed
on
that
occasion
never
transpired
all
that
is
known
is
that
his
holiness
expressed
considerable
surprise
on
learning
from
the
archdeacon
that
the
chalice
was
used
in
the
anglican
church
in
the
administration
of
communion
he
exclaimed
is
the
same
chalice
made
use
of
by
everyone
remember
the
pain
i
felt
said
manning
long
afterwards
seeing
how
unknown
we
were
to
the
vicar
of
jesus
christ
it
made
me
feel
our
isolation
on
his
return
to
england
he
took
up
once
more
the
work
in
his
archdeaconry
with
what
appetite
he
might
ravaged
by
doubt
distracted
by
speculation
he
yet
managed
to
maintain
an
outward
presence
of
unshaken
calm
his
only
confidant
was
robert
wilberforce
to
whom
for
the
next
two
years
he
poured
forth
in
a
series
of
letters
headed
the
seal
to
indicate
that
they
contained
the
secrets
of
the
confessional
the
whole
history
of
his
spiritual
perturbations
the
irony
of
his
position
was
singular
for
during
the
whole
of
this
time
manning
was
himself
holding
back
from
the
church
of
rome
a
host
of
hesitating
penitents
by
means
of
arguments
which
he
was
at
the
very
moment
denouncing
as
fallacious
to
his
own
confessor
but
what
else
could
he
do
when
he
received
for
instance
a
letter
such
as
the
following
from
an
agitated
lady
what
was
he
to
say
dear
father
in
christ
i
am
sure
you
would
pity
me
and
like
to
help
me
if
you
knew
the
unhappy
unsettled
state
my
mind
is
in
and
the
misery
of
being
entirely
wherever
i
am
with
those
who
look
upon
joining
the
church
of
rome
as
the
most
awful
fall
conceivable
to
any
one
and
are
devoid
of
the
smallest
comprehension
of
how
any
enlightened
person
can
do
it
my
old
evangelical
friends
with
all
my
deep
deep
love
for
them
do
not
succeed
in
shaking
me
in
the
least
brother
has
just
published
a
book
called
regeneration
which
all
my
friends
are
reading
and
highly
extolling
it
has
a
very
contrary
effect
to
what
he
would
desire
on
my
mind
i
can
read
and
understand
it
all
in
an
altogether
different
sense
and
the
facts
which
he
quotes
about
the
articles
as
drawn
up
in
and
again
in
and
of
the
irish
articles
of
and
startle
and
shake
me
about
the
reformed
church
in
england
far
more
than
anything
else
and
have
done
so
ever
since
i
first
saw
them
in
maskell
pamphlet
as
quoted
from
mr
dodsworth
do
hope
you
have
some
time
and
thought
to
pray
for
me
still
galton
letters
long
ago
grew
into
short
formal
notes
which
hurt
me
and
annoyed
me
particularly
and
i
never
answered
his
last
so
literally
i
have
no
one
to
say
things
to
and
get
help
from
which
in
one
sense
is
a
comfort
when
my
convictions
seem
to
be
leading
me
on
and
on
and
gaining
strength
in
spite
of
all
the
dreariness
of
my
lot
you
know
i
ca
help
being
very
anxious
and
unhappy
about
poor
sister
harriet
i
am
afraid
of
her
going
out
of
her
mind
she
comforts
herself
by
an
occasional
outpouring
of
everything
to
me
and
i
had
a
letter
this
morning
she
says
sister
may
has
promised
the
vicar
never
to
talk
to
her
or
allow
her
to
talk
on
the
subject
with
her
and
i
doubt
whether
this
can
be
good
for
her
because
though
she
has
lost
her
faith
she
says
in
the
church
of
england
yet
she
never
thinks
of
what
she
could
have
faith
in
and
resolutely
without
inquiring
into
the
question
determines
not
to
be
a
roman
catholic
so
that
really
you
see
she
is
allowing
her
mind
to
run
adrift
and
yet
perfectly
powerless
my
troubling
you
with
this
letter
and
believe
me
to
be
always
your
faithful
grateful
and
affectionate
daughter
ryle
i
wish
i
could
see
you
once
more
so
very
much
how
was
manning
a
director
of
souls
and
a
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
to
reply
that
in
sober
truth
there
was
very
little
to
choose
between
the
state
of
mind
of
sister
emma
or
even
of
sister
harriet
and
his
own
the
dilemma
was
a
grievous
one
when
a
soldier
finds
himself
fighting
for
a
cause
in
which
he
has
lost
faith
it
is
treachery
to
stop
and
it
is
treachery
to
go
on
at
last
in
the
seclusion
of
his
library
manning
turned
in
agony
to
those
old
writings
which
had
provided
newman
with
so
much
instruction
and
assistance
perhaps
the
fathers
would
do
something
for
him
as
well
he
ransacked
the
pages
of
cyprian
and
cyril
he
went
through
the
complete
works
of
optatus
and
leo
he
explored
the
vast
treatises
of
tertullian
and
justin
martyr
he
had
a
lamp
put
into
his
phaeton
so
that
he
might
lose
no
time
during
his
long
winter
drives
there
he
sat
searching
chrysostom
for
some
mitigation
of
his
anguish
while
he
sped
along
between
the
hedges
to
distant
sufferers
to
whom
he
duly
administered
the
sacraments
according
to
the
rites
of
the
english
church
he
hurried
back
to
commit
to
his
diary
the
analysis
of
his
reflections
and
to
describe
under
the
mystic
formula
of
secrecy
the
intricate
workings
of
his
conscience
to
robert
wilberforce
but
alas
he
was
no
newman
and
even
the
fourteen
folios
of
augustine
himself
strange
to
say
gave
him
very
little
help
the
final
propulsion
was
to
come
from
an
entirely
different
quarter
in
november
the
reverend
gorham
was
presented
by
the
lord
chancellor
to
the
living
of
bramford
speke
in
the
diocese
of
exeter
the
bishop
phillpotts
was
a
high
churchman
and
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
gorham
held
evangelical
opinions
he
therefore
subjected
him
to
an
examination
on
doctrine
which
took
the
form
partly
of
a
verbal
interrogatory
lasting
hours
and
partly
of
a
series
of
one
hundred
and
written
questions
at
the
end
of
the
examination
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
gorham
held
heretical
views
on
the
subject
of
baptismal
regeneration
and
he
therefore
refused
to
institute
gorham
thereupon
took
proceedings
against
the
bishop
in
the
court
of
arches
he
lost
his
case
and
he
then
appealed
to
the
judicial
committee
of
the
privy
council
the
questions
at
issue
were
taken
very
seriously
by
a
large
number
of
persons
in
the
first
place
there
was
the
question
of
baptismal
regeneration
itself
this
is
by
no
means
an
easy
one
to
disentangle
but
it
may
be
noted
that
the
doctrine
of
baptism
includes
intention
that
is
to
say
his
purpose
in
electing
certain
persons
to
eternal
life
an
abstruse
and
greatly
controverted
subject
upon
which
the
church
of
england
abstains
from
strict
definition
god
action
whether
by
means
of
sacraments
or
otherwise
concerning
which
the
church
of
england
maintains
the
efficacy
of
sacraments
but
does
not
formally
deny
that
grace
may
be
given
by
other
means
repentance
and
faith
being
present
and
the
question
whether
sacramental
grace
is
given
instrumentally
by
and
at
the
moment
of
the
act
of
baptism
or
in
consequence
of
an
act
of
prevenient
grace
rendering
the
receiver
worthy
that
is
to
say
whether
sacramental
grace
in
baptism
is
given
absolutely
or
conditionally
it
was
over
this
last
question
that
the
dispute
raged
hottest
in
the
gorham
case
the
high
church
party
represented
by
phillpotts
asserted
that
the
mere
act
of
baptism
conferred
regeneration
upon
the
recipient
and
washed
away
his
original
sin
to
this
the
evangelicals
headed
by
gorham
replied
that
according
to
the
articles
regeneration
would
not
follow
unless
baptism
was
rightly
received
what
then
was
the
meaning
of
clearly
it
implied
not
merely
lawful
administration
but
worthy
reception
worthiness
therefore
is
the
essence
of
the
sacrament
and
worthiness
means
faith
and
repentance
now
two
propositions
were
accepted
by
both
parties
that
all
infants
are
born
in
original
sin
and
that
original
sin
could
be
washed
away
by
baptism
but
how
could
both
these
propositions
be
true
argued
gorham
if
it
was
also
true
that
faith
and
repentance
were
necessary
before
baptism
could
come
into
operation
at
all
how
could
an
infant
in
arms
be
said
to
be
in
a
state
of
faith
and
repentance
how
therefore
could
its
original
sin
be
washed
away
by
baptism
and
yet
as
every
one
agreed
washed
away
it
was
the
only
solution
of
the
difficulty
lay
in
the
doctrine
of
prevenient
grace
and
gorham
maintained
that
unless
god
performed
an
act
of
prevenient
grace
by
which
the
infant
was
endowed
with
faith
and
repentance
no
act
of
baptism
could
be
effectual
though
to
whom
and
under
what
conditions
prevenient
grace
was
given
gorham
confessed
himself
unable
to
decide
the
light
thrown
by
the
bible
upon
the
whole
matter
seemed
somewhat
dubious
for
whereas
the
baptism
of
disciples
at
jerusalem
and
philip
at
samaria
was
followed
by
the
gift
of
the
spirit
in
the
case
of
cornelius
the
sacrament
succeeded
the
gift
paul
also
was
baptised
and
as
for
the
language
of
john
iii
rom
vi
i
peter
iii
it
admits
of
more
than
one
interpretation
there
could
however
be
no
doubt
that
the
church
of
england
assented
to
phillpotts
opinion
the
question
was
whether
or
not
she
excluded
gorham
if
it
was
decided
that
she
did
it
was
clear
that
henceforward
there
would
be
very
little
peace
for
evangelicals
within
her
fold
but
there
was
another
issue
even
more
fundamental
than
that
of
baptismal
regeneration
itself
involved
in
the
gorham
trial
an
act
passed
in
had
constituted
the
judicial
committee
of
the
privy
council
the
supreme
court
of
appeal
for
such
cases
and
this
committee
was
a
body
composed
entirely
of
laymen
it
was
thus
obvious
that
the
royal
supremacy
was
still
a
fact
and
that
a
collection
of
lawyers
appointed
by
the
crown
had
the
legal
right
to
formulate
the
religious
doctrine
of
the
church
of
england
in
their
judgment
was
delivered
they
reversed
the
decision
of
the
court
of
arches
and
upheld
the
position
of
gorham
whether
his
views
were
theologically
correct
or
not
they
said
was
not
their
business
it
was
their
business
to
decide
whether
the
opinions
under
consideration
were
contrary
or
repugnant
to
the
doctrine
of
the
church
of
england
as
enjoined
upon
the
clergy
by
its
articles
formularies
and
rubrics
and
they
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
not
the
judgement
still
holds
good
and
to
this
day
a
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
is
quite
at
liberty
to
believe
that
regeneration
does
not
invariably
take
place
when
an
infant
is
baptised
the
blow
fell
upon
no
one
with
greater
violence
than
upon
manning
not
only
was
the
supreme
efficacy
of
the
sign
of
the
cross
upon
a
forehead
one
of
his
favourite
doctrines
but
up
to
that
moment
he
had
been
convinced
that
the
royal
supremacy
was
a
mere
accident
a
temporary
usurpation
which
left
the
spiritual
dominion
of
the
church
essentially
untouched
but
now
the
horrid
reality
rose
up
before
him
crowned
and
triumphant
it
was
all
too
clear
that
an
act
of
parliament
passed
by
jews
roman
catholics
and
dissenters
was
the
ultimate
authority
which
decided
upon
the
momentous
niceties
of
the
anglican
faith
gladstone
also
was
deeply
perturbed
it
was
absolutely
necessary
he
wrote
to
and
defend
the
conscience
of
the
church
from
the
present
hideous
system
an
agitation
was
set
on
foot
and
several
influential
anglicans
with
manning
at
their
head
drew
up
and
signed
a
formal
protest
against
the
gorham
judgment
gladstone
however
proposed
another
method
of
procedure
precipitate
action
he
declared
must
be
avoided
at
all
costs
and
he
elaborated
a
scheme
for
securing
procrastination
by
which
a
covenant
was
to
bind
all
those
who
believed
that
an
article
of
the
creed
had
been
abolished
by
act
of
parliament
to
take
no
steps
in
any
direction
nor
to
announce
their
intention
of
doing
so
until
a
given
space
of
time
had
elapsed
gladstone
was
hopeful
that
some
good
might
come
of
this
though
indeed
he
could
not
be
sure
others
he
wrote
to
manning
have
consulted
robert
wilberforce
and
and
they
seemed
inclined
to
favour
my
proposal
it
might
perhaps
have
kept
back
lord
feilding
but
he
is
like
a
cork
the
proposal
was
certainly
not
favoured
by
manning
protests
and
procrastinations
approving
and
lord
feildings
all
this
was
feeding
the
wind
and
folly
the
time
for
action
had
come
can
no
longer
continue
he
wrote
to
robert
wilberforce
oath
and
subscription
binding
me
to
the
royal
supremacy
in
ecclesiastical
causes
being
convinced
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
divine
office
of
the
church
that
it
has
involved
the
church
of
england
in
a
separation
from
the
universal
church
which
separation
i
can
not
clear
of
the
character
of
schism
that
it
has
thereby
suspended
and
prevented
the
functions
of
the
church
of
england
it
was
in
vain
that
robert
wilberforce
pleaded
in
vain
that
gladstone
urged
upon
his
mind
the
significance
of
john
iii
wind
bloweth
where
it
listeth
and
thou
hearest
the
sound
thereof
but
canst
not
tell
whence
it
cometh
and
whither
it
goeth
so
is
everyone
that
is
born
of
the
spirit
admit
gladstone
wrote
the
words
might
in
some
way
be
satisfied
by
supposing
our
lord
simply
to
mean
the
facts
of
nature
are
unintelligible
therefore
be
not
afraid
if
revealed
truths
be
likewise
beyond
the
compass
of
the
understanding
but
this
seems
to
me
a
meagre
meaning
such
considerations
could
hold
him
no
longer
and
manning
executed
the
resignation
of
his
office
and
benefice
before
a
public
notary
soon
afterwards
in
the
little
chapel
off
buckingham
palace
road
kneeling
beside
gladstone
he
worshipped
for
the
last
time
as
an
anglican
thirty
years
later
the
cardinal
told
how
just
before
the
communion
service
commenced
he
turned
to
his
friends
with
the
words
can
no
longer
take
the
communion
in
the
church
of
england
rose
up
and
laying
my
hand
on
gladstone
shoulder
said
come
it
was
the
parting
of
the
ways
gladstone
remained
and
i
went
my
way
gladstone
still
remains
where
i
left
him
on
april
the
final
step
was
taken
manning
was
received
into
the
roman
catholic
church
now
at
last
after
the
long
struggle
his
mind
was
at
rest
know
what
you
mean
he
wrote
to
robert
wilberforce
saying
that
one
sometimes
feels
as
if
all
this
might
turn
out
to
be
only
another
land
of
shadows
i
have
felt
it
in
time
past
but
not
now
the
theologia
from
nice
to
thomas
aquinas
and
the
undivided
unity
suffused
throughout
the
world
of
which
the
cathedra
petri
is
the
centre
is
now
years
old
and
mightier
in
every
power
now
than
ever
in
intellect
in
science
in
separation
from
the
world
and
purer
too
refined
by
years
of
conflict
with
the
modern
infidel
civilisation
all
of
this
is
a
fact
more
solid
than
the
earth
when
manning
joined
the
church
of
rome
he
acted
under
the
combined
impulse
of
the
two
dominating
forces
in
his
nature
his
preoccupation
with
the
supernatural
might
alone
have
been
satisfied
within
the
fold
of
the
anglican
communion
and
so
might
his
preoccupation
with
himself
the
one
might
have
found
vent
in
the
elaborations
of
high
church
ritual
and
the
other
in
the
activities
of
a
bishopric
but
the
two
together
could
not
be
quieted
so
easily
the
church
of
england
is
a
commodious
institution
she
is
very
anxious
to
please
but
somehow
or
other
she
has
never
managed
to
supply
a
happy
home
to
superstitious
egotists
an
escape
for
my
poor
soul
manning
is
said
to
have
exclaimed
when
shortly
after
his
conversion
a
mitre
was
going
but
in
truth
manning
soul
had
scented
nobler
quarry
to
one
of
his
temperament
how
was
it
possible
when
once
the
choice
was
plainly
put
to
hesitate
for
a
moment
between
the
respectable
dignity
of
an
english
bishop
harnessed
by
the
secular
power
with
the
gorham
judgment
as
a
bit
between
his
teeth
and
the
illimitable
pretensions
of
the
humblest
priest
of
rome
for
the
moment
however
it
seemed
as
if
the
fates
had
at
last
been
successful
in
their
little
game
of
shunting
manning
the
splendid
career
which
he
had
so
laboriously
built
up
from
the
small
beginnings
of
his
sussex
curacy
was
shattered
and
shattered
by
the
inevitable
operation
of
his
own
essential
needs
he
was
over
forty
and
he
had
been
put
back
once
more
to
the
very
bottom
rung
of
the
ladder
a
neophyte
with
so
far
as
could
be
seen
no
special
claim
to
the
attention
of
his
new
superiors
the
example
of
newman
a
far
more
illustrious
convert
was
hardly
reassuring
he
had
been
relegated
to
a
complete
obscurity
in
which
he
was
to
remain
until
extreme
old
age
why
should
there
be
anything
better
in
store
for
manning
yet
it
so
happened
that
within
fourteen
years
of
his
conversion
manning
was
archbishop
of
westminster
and
the
supreme
ruler
of
the
roman
catholic
community
in
england
this
time
the
fates
gave
up
the
unequal
struggle
they
paid
over
their
stakes
in
despair
and
retired
from
the
game
nevertheless
it
is
difficult
to
feel
quite
sure
that
manning
plunge
was
as
hazardous
as
it
appeared
certainly
he
was
not
a
man
who
was
likely
to
forget
to
look
before
he
leaped
nor
one
who
if
he
happened
to
know
that
there
was
a
mattress
spread
to
receive
him
would
leap
with
less
conviction
in
the
light
of
one
would
be
glad
to
know
what
precisely
passed
at
that
mysterious
interview
of
his
with
the
pope
three
years
before
his
conversion
it
is
at
least
possible
that
the
authorities
in
rome
had
their
eye
on
manning
the
may
well
have
felt
that
the
archdeacon
of
chichester
would
be
a
great
catch
what
did
pio
nono
say
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
persuasive
innocence
of
his
italian
voice
dear
signor
manning
why
do
you
come
over
to
us
do
you
suppose
that
we
should
not
look
after
you
at
any
rate
when
he
did
go
over
manning
was
looked
after
very
thoroughly
there
was
it
is
true
a
momentary
embarrassment
at
the
outset
it
was
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
he
could
bring
himself
to
abandon
his
faith
in
the
validity
of
anglican
orders
in
which
he
believed
consciousness
stronger
than
all
reasoning
he
was
convinced
that
he
was
still
a
priest
when
the
rev
tierney
who
had
received
him
into
the
roman
catholic
communion
assured
him
that
this
was
not
the
case
he
was
filled
with
dismay
and
mortification
after
a
five
hour
discussion
he
started
to
his
feet
in
a
rage
tierney
he
exclaimed
think
me
insincere
the
bitter
draught
was
swallowed
at
last
and
after
that
all
went
smoothly
manning
hastened
to
rome
and
was
immediately
placed
by
the
pope
in
the
highly
select
accademia
ecclesiastica
commonly
known
as
the
of
cardinals
for
the
purpose
of
completing
his
theological
studies
when
the
course
was
finished
he
continued
by
the
special
request
to
spend
six
months
of
every
year
in
rome
where
he
preached
to
the
english
visitors
became
acquainted
with
the
great
personages
of
the
papal
court
and
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
constant
interviews
with
the
holy
father
at
the
same
time
he
was
able
to
make
himself
useful
in
london
where
cardinal
wiseman
the
newly
created
archbishop
of
westminster
was
seeking
to
reanimate
the
roman
catholic
community
manning
was
not
only
extremely
popular
in
the
pulpit
and
in
the
confessional
he
was
not
only
highly
efficient
as
a
gleaner
of
souls
and
of
souls
who
moved
in
the
best
society
he
also
possessed
a
familiarity
with
official
persons
and
official
ways
which
was
invaluable
when
the
question
arose
of
the
appointment
of
catholic
chaplains
in
the
crimea
during
the
war
it
was
manning
who
approached
the
minister
interviewed
the
permanent
secretary
and
finally
succeeded
in
obtaining
all
that
was
required
when
a
special
reformatory
for
catholic
children
was
proposed
manning
carried
through
the
negotiation
with
the
government
when
an
attempt
was
made
to
remove
catholic
children
from
the
workhouses
manning
was
again
indispensable
no
wonder
cardinal
wiseman
soon
determined
to
find
some
occupation
of
special
importance
for
the
energetic
convert
he
had
long
wished
to
establish
a
congregation
of
secular
priests
in
london
particularly
devoted
to
his
service
and
the
opportunity
for
the
experiment
had
clearly
now
arisen
the
order
of
the
oblates
of
charles
was
founded
in
bayswater
and
manning
was
put
at
its
head
unfortunately
no
portion
of
the
body
of
charles
could
be
obtained
for
the
new
community
but
two
relics
of
his
blood
were
brought
over
to
bayswater
from
milan
almost
at
the
same
time
the
pope
signified
his
appreciation
of
manning
efforts
by
appointing
him
provost
of
the
chapter
of
westminster
a
position
which
placed
him
at
the
head
of
the
canons
of
the
diocese
this
double
promotion
was
the
signal
for
the
outbreak
of
an
extraordinary
internal
struggle
which
raged
without
intermission
for
the
next
seven
years
and
was
to
end
only
with
the
accession
of
manning
to
the
archbishopric
the
condition
of
the
roman
catholic
community
in
england
was
at
that
time
a
singular
one
on
the
one
hand
the
old
repressive
laws
of
the
seventeenth
century
had
been
repealed
by
liberal
legislation
and
on
the
other
a
large
new
body
of
distinguished
converts
had
entered
the
roman
church
as
a
result
of
the
oxford
movement
it
was
evident
that
there
was
a
in
english
catholicism
and
in
pius
ix
recognised
the
fact
by
dividing
up
the
whole
of
england
into
dioceses
and
placing
wiseman
at
the
head
of
them
as
archbishop
of
westminster
wiseman
encyclical
dated
without
the
flaminian
gate
in
which
he
announced
the
new
departure
was
greeted
in
england
by
a
storm
of
indignation
culminating
in
the
famous
and
furibund
letter
of
lord
john
russell
then
prime
minister
against
the
insolence
of
the
aggression
though
the
particular
point
against
which
the
outcry
was
raised
the
english
territorial
titles
of
the
new
roman
bishops
was
an
insignificant
one
the
instinct
of
lord
john
and
of
the
english
people
was
in
reality
sound
enough
wiseman
installation
did
mean
in
fact
a
new
move
in
the
papal
game
it
meant
an
advance
if
not
an
aggression
a
quickening
in
england
of
the
energies
of
the
roman
church
that
church
has
never
had
the
reputation
of
being
an
institution
to
be
trifled
with
and
in
those
days
the
pope
was
still
ruling
as
a
temporal
prince
over
the
fairest
provinces
of
italy
surely
if
the
images
of
guy
fawkes
had
not
been
garnished
on
that
fifth
of
november
with
triple
crowns
it
would
have
been
a
very
poor
compliment
to
his
holiness
but
it
was
not
only
the
honest
protestants
of
england
who
had
cause
to
dread
the
arrival
of
the
new
cardinal
archbishop
there
was
a
party
among
the
catholics
themselves
who
viewed
his
installation
with
alarm
and
disgust
the
families
in
which
the
catholic
tradition
had
been
handed
down
uninterruptedly
since
the
days
of
elizabeth
which
had
known
the
pains
of
exile
and
of
martyrdom
and
which
clung
together
an
alien
and
isolated
group
in
the
midst
of
english
society
now
began
to
feel
that
they
were
after
all
of
small
moment
in
the
counsels
of
rome
they
had
laboured
through
the
heat
of
the
day
but
now
it
seemed
as
if
the
harvest
was
to
be
gathered
in
by
a
crowd
of
converts
who
were
proclaiming
on
every
side
as
something
new
and
wonderful
the
truths
which
the
old
catholics
as
they
came
to
be
called
had
not
only
known
but
for
which
they
had
suffered
for
generations
cardinal
wiseman
it
is
true
was
no
convert
he
belonged
to
one
of
the
oldest
of
the
catholic
families
but
he
had
spent
most
of
his
life
in
rome
he
was
out
of
touch
with
english
traditions
and
his
sympathy
with
newman
and
his
followers
was
only
too
apparent
one
of
his
first
acts
as
archbishop
was
to
appoint
the
convert
ward
who
was
not
even
in
holy
orders
to
be
professor
of
theology
at
edmund
college
the
chief
seminary
for
young
priests
in
which
the
ancient
traditions
of
douay
were
still
flourishing
ward
was
an
ardent
papalist
and
his
appointment
indicated
clearly
enough
that
in
wiseman
opinion
there
was
too
little
of
the
italian
spirit
in
the
english
community
the
uneasiness
of
the
old
catholics
was
becoming
intense
when
they
were
reassured
by
appointing
as
his
and
successor
his
intimate
friend
errington
who
was
created
on
the
occasion
archbishop
of
trebizond
in
partibus
infidelium
not
only
was
errington
an
old
catholic
of
the
most
rigid
type
he
was
a
man
of
extreme
energy
whose
influence
was
certain
to
be
great
and
in
any
case
wiseman
was
growing
old
so
that
before
very
long
it
seemed
inevitable
that
the
policy
of
the
diocese
would
be
in
proper
hands
such
was
the
position
of
affairs
when
two
years
after
errington
appointment
manning
became
head
of
the
oblates
of
charles
and
provost
of
the
chapter
of
westminster
the
archbishop
of
trebizond
had
been
for
some
time
growing
more
and
more
suspicious
of
manning
influence
and
this
sudden
elevation
appeared
to
justify
his
worst
fears
but
his
alarm
was
turned
to
fury
when
he
learned
that
edmund
college
from
which
he
had
just
succeeded
in
removing
the
obnoxious
ward
was
to
be
placed
under
the
control
of
the
oblates
of
charles
the
oblates
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
the
fact
that
one
of
their
principal
aims
was
to
introduce
the
customs
of
a
roman
seminary
into
england
a
grim
perspective
of
espionage
and
foreign
habits
and
italian
devotions
opened
out
before
the
dismayed
eyes
of
the
old
catholics
they
determined
to
resist
to
the
utmost
and
it
was
upon
the
question
of
the
control
of
edmund
that
the
first
battle
in
the
long
campaign
between
errington
and
manning
was
fought
cardinal
wiseman
was
now
obviously
declining
towards
the
grave
a
man
of
vast
physique
immense
an
irish
servant
used
respectfully
to
call
him
of
sanguine
temperament
of
genial
disposition
of
versatile
capacity
he
seemed
to
have
engrafted
upon
the
robustness
of
his
english
nature
the
facile
and
expansive
qualities
of
the
south
so
far
from
being
a
bishop
blougram
as
the
rumour
went
he
was
in
fact
the
very
antithesis
of
that
subtle
and
ecclesiastic
he
had
innocently
looked
forward
all
his
life
to
the
reunion
of
england
to
the
see
of
peter
and
eventually
had
come
to
believe
that
in
god
hand
he
was
the
instrument
destined
to
bring
about
this
miraculous
consummation
was
not
the
oxford
movement
with
its
flood
of
converts
a
clear
sign
of
the
divine
will
had
he
not
himself
been
the
author
of
that
momentous
article
on
augustine
and
the
donatists
which
had
finally
convinced
newman
that
the
church
of
england
was
in
schism
and
then
had
he
not
been
able
to
set
afoot
a
crusade
of
prayer
throughout
catholic
europe
for
the
conversion
of
england
he
awaited
the
result
with
eager
expectation
and
in
the
meantime
he
set
himself
to
smooth
away
the
hostility
of
his
countrymen
by
delivering
courses
of
popular
lectures
on
literature
and
archaeology
he
devoted
much
time
and
attention
to
the
ceremonial
details
of
his
princely
office
his
knowledge
of
rubric
and
ritual
and
of
the
symbolical
significations
of
vestments
has
rarely
been
equalled
and
he
took
a
profound
delight
in
the
ordering
and
the
performance
of
elaborate
processions
during
one
of
these
functions
an
unexpected
difficulty
arose
the
master
of
ceremonies
suddenly
gave
the
word
for
a
halt
and
on
being
asked
the
reason
replied
that
he
had
been
instructed
that
moment
by
special
revelation
to
stop
the
procession
the
cardinal
however
was
not
at
a
loss
may
let
the
procession
go
on
he
smilingly
replied
have
just
obtained
permission
by
special
revelation
to
proceed
with
it
his
leisure
hours
he
spent
in
the
writing
of
edifying
novels
the
composition
of
acrostics
in
latin
verse
and
in
playing
battledore
and
shuttlecock
with
his
little
nieces
there
was
indeed
only
one
point
in
which
he
resembled
bishop
blougram
his
love
of
a
good
table
some
of
newman
disciples
were
astonished
and
grieved
to
find
that
he
sat
down
to
four
courses
of
fish
during
lent
am
sorry
to
say
remarked
one
of
them
afterwards
there
is
a
lobster
salad
side
to
the
cardinal
it
was
a
melancholy
fate
which
ordained
that
the
last
years
of
this
comfortable
easygoing
innocent
old
man
should
be
distracted
and
embittered
by
the
fury
of
opposing
principles
and
the
venom
of
personal
animosities
but
so
it
was
he
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
one
who
cared
very
little
for
the
gentle
pleasures
of
repose
left
to
himself
wiseman
might
have
compromised
with
the
old
catholics
and
errington
but
when
manning
had
once
appeared
upon
the
scene
all
compromise
became
impossible
the
late
archdeacon
of
chichester
who
had
understood
so
well
and
practised
with
such
careful
skill
the
precept
of
the
golden
mean
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
church
of
england
now
as
provost
of
westminster
flung
himself
into
the
fray
with
that
unyielding
intensity
of
fervour
that
passion
for
the
extreme
and
the
absolute
which
is
the
very
lifeblood
of
the
church
of
rome
even
the
redoubtable
errington
short
thickset
determined
with
his
expression
of
face
as
a
contemporary
described
him
he
looked
at
you
through
his
blue
spectacles
had
been
known
to
quail
in
the
presence
of
his
antagonist
with
his
tall
and
graceful
figure
his
pale
ascetic
features
his
compressed
and
icy
lips
his
calm
and
penetrating
gaze
as
for
the
poor
cardinal
he
was
helpless
indeed
henceforward
there
was
to
be
no
paltering
with
that
dangerous
spirit
of
independence
was
it
not
almost
gallicanism
which
possessed
the
old
catholic
families
of
england
the
supremacy
of
the
vicar
of
christ
must
be
maintained
at
all
hazards
compared
with
such
an
object
what
were
the
claims
of
personal
affection
and
domestic
peace
the
cardinal
pleaded
in
vain
his
lifelong
friendship
with
errington
was
plucked
up
by
the
roots
and
the
harmony
of
his
private
life
was
utterly
destroyed
his
own
household
was
turned
against
him
his
favourite
nephew
whom
he
had
placed
among
the
oblates
under
manning
special
care
left
the
congregation
and
openly
joined
the
party
of
errington
his
secretary
followed
suit
but
saddest
of
all
was
the
case
of
monsignor
searle
monsignor
searle
in
the
capacity
of
confidential
man
of
affairs
had
dominated
over
the
cardinal
in
private
for
years
with
the
autocratic
fidelity
of
a
servant
who
has
grown
indispensable
his
devotion
in
fact
seemed
to
have
taken
the
form
of
physical
imitation
for
he
was
hardly
less
gigantic
than
his
master
the
two
were
inseparable
their
huge
figures
loomed
together
like
neighbouring
mountains
and
on
one
occasion
meeting
them
in
the
street
a
gentleman
congratulated
wiseman
on
eminence
fine
son
yet
now
even
this
companionship
was
broken
up
the
relentless
provost
here
too
brought
a
sword
there
were
explosions
and
recriminations
monsignor
searle
finding
that
his
power
was
slipping
from
him
made
scenes
and
protests
and
at
last
was
foolish
enough
to
accuse
manning
of
peculation
to
his
face
after
that
it
was
clear
that
his
day
was
over
he
was
forced
to
slink
snarling
into
the
background
while
the
cardinal
shuddered
through
all
his
immensity
and
wished
many
times
that
he
were
already
dead
yet
he
was
not
altogether
without
his
consolations
manning
took
care
to
see
to
that
his
piercing
eye
had
detected
the
secret
way
into
the
recesses
of
the
cardinal
heart
had
discerned
the
core
of
simple
faith
which
underlay
that
jovial
manner
and
that
facile
talk
others
were
content
to
laugh
and
chatter
and
transact
their
business
manning
was
more
artistic
he
watched
his
opportunity
and
then
when
the
moment
came
touched
with
a
deft
finger
the
chord
of
the
conversion
of
england
there
was
an
immediate
response
and
he
struck
the
same
chord
again
and
yet
again
he
became
the
repository
of
the
cardinal
most
intimate
aspirations
he
alone
sympathised
and
understood
god
gives
me
strength
to
undertake
a
great
with
infidelity
wiseman
wrote
shall
owe
it
to
him
but
what
he
really
found
himself
undertaking
was
a
with
errington
the
struggle
over
edmund
college
grew
more
and
more
acute
there
were
high
words
in
the
chapter
where
monsignor
searle
led
the
assault
against
the
provost
and
carried
a
resolution
declaring
that
the
oblates
of
charles
had
intruded
themselves
illegally
into
the
seminary
the
cardinal
quashed
the
proceedings
of
the
chapter
whereupon
the
chapter
appealed
to
rome
errington
carried
away
by
the
fury
of
the
controversy
then
appeared
as
the
avowed
opponent
of
the
provost
and
the
cardinal
with
his
own
hand
he
drew
up
a
document
justifying
the
appeal
of
the
chapter
to
rome
by
canon
law
and
the
decrees
of
the
council
of
trent
wiseman
was
deeply
pained
own
he
exclaimed
acting
as
solicitor
against
me
in
a
lawsuit
there
was
a
rush
to
rome
where
for
several
ensuing
years
the
hostile
english
parties
were
to
wage
a
furious
battle
in
the
antechambers
of
the
vatican
but
the
dispute
over
the
oblates
now
sank
into
insignificance
beside
the
rage
of
contention
which
centred
round
a
new
and
far
more
deadly
question
for
the
position
of
errington
himself
was
at
stake
the
cardinal
in
spite
of
illness
indolence
and
the
ties
of
friendship
had
been
brought
at
last
to
an
extraordinary
step
he
was
petitioning
the
pope
for
nothing
less
than
the
deprivation
and
removal
of
the
archbishop
of
trebizond
the
precise
details
of
what
followed
are
doubtful
it
is
only
possible
to
discern
with
clearness
amid
a
vast
cloud
of
official
documents
and
unofficial
correspondences
in
english
italian
and
latin
of
papal
decrees
and
voluminous
scritture
of
confidential
reports
of
episcopal
whispers
and
the
secret
agitations
of
cardinals
the
form
of
manning
restless
and
indomitable
scouring
like
a
stormy
petrel
the
angry
ocean
of
debate
wiseman
dilatory
unbusinesslike
and
infirm
was
ready
enough
to
leave
the
conduct
of
affairs
in
his
hands
nor
was
it
long
before
manning
saw
where
the
key
of
the
whole
position
lay
as
in
the
old
days
at
chichester
he
had
secured
the
goodwill
of
bishop
shuttleworth
by
cultivating
the
friendship
of
archdeacon
hare
so
now
on
this
vaster
scale
of
operations
his
sagacity
led
him
swiftly
and
unerringly
up
the
little
winding
staircase
in
the
vatican
and
through
the
humble
door
which
opened
into
the
cabinet
of
monsignor
talbot
the
private
secretary
of
the
pope
monsignor
talbot
was
a
priest
who
embodied
in
a
singular
manner
if
not
the
highest
at
least
the
most
persistent
traditions
of
the
roman
curia
he
was
a
master
of
various
arts
which
the
practice
of
ages
has
brought
to
perfection
under
the
friendly
shadow
of
the
triple
tiara
he
could
mingle
together
astuteness
and
holiness
without
any
difficulty
he
could
make
innuendoes
as
naturally
as
an
ordinary
man
makes
statements
of
fact
he
could
apply
flattery
with
so
unsparing
a
hand
that
even
princes
of
the
church
found
it
sufficient
and
on
occasion
he
could
ring
the
changes
of
torture
on
a
human
soul
with
a
tact
which
called
forth
universal
approbation
with
such
accomplishments
it
could
hardly
be
expected
that
monsignor
talbot
should
be
remarkable
either
for
a
delicate
sense
of
conscientiousness
or
for
an
extreme
refinement
of
feeling
but
then
it
was
not
for
those
qualities
that
manning
was
in
search
when
he
went
up
the
winding
stair
he
was
looking
for
the
man
who
had
the
ear
of
pio
nono
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
he
found
him
then
he
put
forth
all
his
efforts
his
success
was
complete
and
an
alliance
began
which
was
destined
to
have
the
profoundest
effect
upon
manning
career
and
was
only
dissolved
when
many
years
later
monsignor
talbot
was
unfortunately
obliged
to
exchange
his
apartment
in
the
vatican
for
a
private
lunatic
asylum
at
passy
it
was
determined
that
the
coalition
should
be
ratified
by
the
ruin
of
errington
when
the
moment
of
crisis
was
seen
to
be
approaching
wiseman
was
summoned
to
rome
where
he
began
to
draw
up
an
immense
scrittura
containing
his
statement
of
the
case
for
months
past
the
redoubtable
energies
of
the
archbishop
of
trebizond
had
been
absorbed
in
a
similar
task
folio
was
being
piled
upon
folio
when
a
sudden
blow
threatened
to
put
an
end
to
the
whole
proceeding
in
a
summary
manner
the
cardinal
was
seized
by
violent
illness
and
appeared
to
be
upon
his
deathbed
manning
thought
for
a
moment
that
his
labours
had
been
in
vain
and
that
all
was
lost
but
the
cardinal
recovered
monsignor
talbot
used
his
influence
as
he
alone
knew
how
and
a
papal
decree
was
issued
by
which
errington
was
from
the
coadjutorship
of
westminster
together
with
the
right
of
succession
to
the
see
it
was
a
supreme
act
of
authority
a
di
stato
di
dominiddio
as
the
pope
himself
said
and
the
blow
to
the
old
catholics
was
correspondingly
severe
they
found
themselves
deprived
at
one
fell
swoop
both
of
the
influence
of
their
most
energetic
supporter
and
of
the
certainty
of
coming
into
power
at
wiseman
death
and
in
the
meantime
manning
was
redoubling
his
energies
at
bayswater
though
his
oblates
had
been
checked
over
edmund
there
was
still
no
lack
of
work
for
them
to
do
there
were
missions
to
be
carried
on
schools
to
be
managed
funds
to
be
collected
several
new
churches
were
built
a
community
of
most
edifying
nuns
of
the
third
order
of
francis
was
established
and
raised
from
manning
private
resources
and
from
those
of
his
friends
was
spent
in
three
years
hate
that
man
one
of
the
old
catholics
exclaimed
is
such
a
forward
piece
the
words
were
reported
to
manning
who
shrugged
his
shoulders
man
he
said
is
he
made
of
does
he
suppose
in
his
foolishness
that
after
working
day
and
night
for
twenty
years
in
heresy
and
schism
on
becoming
a
catholic
i
should
sit
in
an
and
fold
my
hands
all
the
rest
of
my
life
but
his
secret
thoughts
were
of
a
different
caste
am
conscious
of
a
desire
he
wrote
in
his
diary
be
in
such
a
position
i
as
i
had
in
times
past
as
my
present
circumstances
imply
as
my
friends
think
me
fit
for
and
as
i
feel
my
own
faculties
tend
to
god
being
my
helper
i
will
not
seek
it
by
the
lifting
of
a
finger
or
the
speaking
of
a
word
so
manning
wrote
and
thought
and
prayed
but
what
are
words
and
thoughts
and
even
prayers
to
the
mysterious
and
relentless
powers
of
circumstance
and
character
cardinal
wiseman
was
slowly
dying
the
tiller
of
the
church
was
slipping
from
his
feeble
hand
and
manning
was
beside
him
the
one
man
with
the
energy
the
ability
the
courage
and
the
conviction
to
steer
the
ship
upon
her
course
more
than
that
there
was
the
sinister
figure
of
a
errington
crouching
close
at
hand
ready
to
seize
the
helm
and
make
straight
who
could
doubt
it
for
the
rocks
in
such
a
situation
the
voice
of
must
needs
grow
still
and
small
indeed
yet
it
spoke
on
for
it
was
one
of
the
paradoxes
in
manning
soul
that
that
voice
was
never
silent
whatever
else
he
was
he
was
not
unscrupulous
rather
his
scruples
deepened
with
his
desires
and
he
could
satisfy
his
most
exorbitant
ambitions
in
a
profundity
of
and
so
now
he
vowed
to
heaven
that
he
would
seek
nothing
no
not
by
the
lifting
of
a
finger
or
the
speaking
of
a
word
but
if
something
came
to
him
he
had
vowed
not
to
seek
he
had
not
vowed
not
to
take
might
it
not
be
his
plain
duty
to
take
might
it
not
be
the
will
of
god
something
of
course
did
come
to
him
though
it
seemed
for
a
moment
that
it
would
elude
his
grasp
wiseman
died
and
there
ensued
in
rome
a
crisis
of
extraordinary
intensity
the
creation
of
the
hierarchy
monsignor
talbot
wrote
it
is
the
greatest
moment
for
the
church
that
i
have
yet
seen
it
was
the
duty
of
the
chapter
of
westminster
to
nominate
three
candidates
for
succession
to
the
archbishopric
they
made
one
last
effort
and
had
the
temerity
to
place
upon
the
list
besides
the
names
of
two
old
catholic
bishops
that
of
errington
it
was
a
fatal
blunder
pius
ix
was
furious
the
chapter
had
committed
an
al
papa
he
exclaimed
striking
his
breast
three
times
in
his
rage
was
the
chapter
that
did
it
said
manning
afterwards
but
even
after
the
chapter
indiscretion
the
fatal
decision
hung
in
the
balance
for
weeks
great
point
of
anxiety
with
me
wrote
monsignor
talbot
to
manning
whether
a
congregation
will
be
held
or
whether
the
holy
father
will
perform
a
pontifical
act
he
himself
is
doubting
i
therefore
say
mass
and
pray
every
morning
that
he
may
have
the
courage
to
choose
for
himself
instead
of
submitting
the
matter
to
a
congregation
although
the
cardinals
are
determined
to
reject
errington
nevertheless
i
am
afraid
that
they
should
select
one
of
the
others
you
know
very
well
that
congregations
are
guided
by
the
documents
that
are
placed
before
them
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
should
prefer
the
pope
acting
himself
but
the
holy
father
himself
was
doubting
in
his
indecision
he
ordered
a
month
of
prayers
and
masses
the
suspense
grew
and
grew
everything
seemed
against
manning
the
whole
english
episcopate
was
opposed
to
him
he
had
quarrelled
with
the
chapter
he
was
a
convert
of
but
few
standing
even
the
congregated
cardinals
did
not
venture
to
suggest
the
appointment
of
such
a
man
but
suddenly
the
holy
father
doubts
came
to
an
end
he
heard
a
voice
a
mysterious
inward
voice
whispering
something
in
his
ear
li
mettetelo
li
the
voice
repeated
over
and
over
again
mettetelo
li
it
was
an
inspiration
and
pius
ix
brushing
aside
the
recommendations
of
the
chapter
and
the
deliberations
of
the
cardinals
made
manning
by
a
pontifical
act
archbishop
of
westminster
monsignor
talbot
felicity
was
complete
and
he
took
occasion
in
conveying
his
congratulations
to
his
friend
to
make
some
illuminating
reflections
upon
the
great
event
policy
throughout
he
wrote
never
to
propose
you
directly
to
the
pope
but
to
make
others
do
so
so
that
both
you
and
i
can
always
say
that
it
was
not
i
who
induced
the
holy
father
to
name
you
which
would
lessen
the
weight
of
your
appointment
this
i
say
because
many
have
said
that
your
being
named
was
all
my
doing
i
do
not
say
that
the
pope
did
not
know
that
i
thought
you
the
only
man
eligible
as
i
took
care
to
tell
him
over
and
over
again
what
was
against
all
the
other
candidates
and
in
consequence
he
was
almost
driven
into
naming
you
after
he
had
named
you
the
holy
father
said
to
me
what
a
diplomatist
you
are
to
make
what
you
wished
come
to
pass
concluded
monsignor
talbot
believe
your
appointment
was
specially
directed
by
the
holy
ghost
manning
himself
was
apparently
of
the
same
opinion
dear
child
he
wrote
to
a
lady
penitent
have
in
these
last
three
weeks
felt
as
if
our
lord
had
called
me
by
name
everything
else
has
passed
out
of
my
mind
the
firm
belief
that
i
have
long
had
that
the
holy
father
is
the
most
supernatural
person
i
have
ever
seen
has
given
me
this
feeling
more
deeply
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
brought
contrary
to
all
human
wills
by
the
divine
will
into
an
immediate
relation
to
our
divine
lord
indeed
he
wrote
to
lady
herbert
were
the
will
of
our
divine
lord
to
lay
upon
me
this
heavy
burden
he
could
have
done
it
in
no
way
more
strengthening
and
consoling
to
me
to
receive
it
from
the
hands
of
his
vicar
and
from
pius
ix
and
after
long
invocation
of
the
holy
ghost
and
not
only
without
human
influences
but
in
spite
of
manifold
aria
powerful
human
opposition
gives
me
the
last
strength
for
such
a
cross
vi
manning
appointment
filled
his
opponents
with
alarm
wrath
and
vengeance
seemed
to
be
hanging
over
them
what
might
not
be
expected
from
the
formidable
enemy
against
whom
they
had
struggled
for
so
long
and
who
now
stood
among
them
armed
with
archiepiscopal
powers
and
invested
with
the
special
confidence
of
rome
great
was
their
amazement
great
was
their
relief
when
they
found
that
their
dreaded
master
breathed
nothing
but
kindness
gentleness
and
conciliation
the
old
scores
they
found
were
not
to
be
paid
off
but
to
be
wiped
out
the
new
archbishop
poured
forth
upon
every
side
all
the
tact
all
the
courtesy
all
the
dignified
graces
of
a
christian
magnanimity
it
was
impossible
to
withstand
such
treatment
bishops
who
had
spent
years
in
thwarting
him
became
his
devoted
adherents
even
the
chapter
of
westminster
forgot
its
hatred
monsignor
talbot
was
extremely
surprised
greatest
enemies
have
entirely
come
round
he
wrote
received
the
other
day
a
panegyric
of
you
from
searle
this
change
of
feeling
i
can
not
attribute
to
anything
but
the
holy
ghost
monsignor
talbot
was
very
fond
of
the
holy
ghost
but
so
far
at
any
rate
as
searle
was
concerned
there
was
another
explanation
manning
instead
of
dismissing
searle
from
his
position
of
in
the
episcopal
household
had
kept
him
on
at
an
increased
salary
and
the
poor
man
who
had
not
scrupled
in
the
days
of
his
pride
to
call
manning
a
thief
was
now
duly
grateful
as
to
errington
he
gave
an
example
of
humility
and
submission
by
at
once
withdrawing
into
a
complete
obscurity
for
years
the
archbishop
of
trebizond
the
ejected
heir
to
the
see
of
westminster
laboured
as
a
parish
priest
in
the
isle
of
man
he
nursed
no
resentment
in
his
heart
and
after
a
long
and
edifying
life
of
peace
and
silence
he
died
in
a
professor
of
theology
at
clifton
it
might
be
supposed
that
manning
could
now
feel
that
his
triumph
was
complete
his
position
was
secure
his
power
was
absolute
his
prestige
was
daily
growing
yet
there
was
something
that
irked
him
still
as
he
cast
his
eyes
over
the
roman
catholic
community
in
england
he
was
aware
of
one
figure
which
by
virtue
of
a
peculiar
eminence
seemed
to
challenge
the
supremacy
of
his
own
that
figure
was
newman
since
his
conversion
newman
life
had
been
a
long
series
of
misfortunes
and
disappointments
when
he
had
left
the
church
of
england
he
was
its
most
distinguished
its
most
revered
member
whose
words
however
strange
were
listened
to
with
profound
attention
and
whose
opinions
however
dubious
were
followed
in
all
their
fluctuations
with
an
eager
and
indeed
a
trembling
respect
he
entered
the
church
of
rome
and
found
himself
forthwith
an
unimportant
man
he
was
received
at
the
papal
court
with
a
politeness
which
only
faintly
concealed
a
total
lack
of
interest
and
understanding
his
delicate
mind
with
its
refinements
its
hesitations
its
complexities
his
soft
spectacled
oxford
manner
with
its
things
were
ill
calculated
to
impress
a
throng
of
busy
cardinals
and
bishops
whose
days
were
spent
amid
the
practical
details
of
ecclesiastical
organisation
the
involutions
of
papal
diplomacy
and
the
delicious
bickerings
of
personal
intrigue
and
when
at
last
he
did
succeed
in
making
some
impression
upon
these
surroundings
it
was
no
better
it
was
worse
an
uneasy
suspicion
gradually
arose
it
began
to
dawn
upon
the
roman
authorities
that
newman
was
a
man
of
ideas
was
it
possible
that
newman
did
not
understand
that
ideas
in
rome
were
to
say
the
least
of
it
out
of
place
apparently
he
did
not
nor
was
that
all
not
content
with
having
ideas
he
positively
seemed
anxious
to
spread
them
when
that
was
known
the
politeness
in
high
places
was
seen
to
be
wearing
decidedly
thin
his
holiness
who
on
newman
arrival
had
graciously
expressed
the
wish
to
see
him
and
again
now
apparently
was
constantly
engaged
at
first
newman
supposed
that
the
growing
coolness
was
the
result
of
misapprehension
his
italian
was
faulty
latin
was
not
spoken
at
rome
his
writings
had
only
appeared
in
garbled
translations
and
even
englishmen
had
sometimes
found
his
arguments
difficult
to
follow
he
therefore
determined
to
take
the
utmost
care
to
make
his
views
quite
clear
his
opinions
upon
religious
probability
his
distinction
between
demonstrative
and
circumstantial
evidence
his
theory
of
the
development
of
doctrine
and
the
aspects
of
ideas
these
and
many
other
matters
upon
which
he
had
written
so
much
he
would
now
explain
in
the
simplest
language
he
would
show
that
there
was
nothing
dangerous
in
what
he
held
that
there
was
a
passage
in
de
lugo
which
supported
him
that
perrone
by
maintaining
that
the
immaculate
conception
could
be
defined
had
implicitly
admitted
one
of
his
main
positions
and
that
his
language
about
faith
had
been
confused
quite
erroneously
with
the
fideism
of
bautain
cardinal
barnabo
cardinal
reisach
cardinal
antonelli
looked
at
him
with
their
shrewd
eyes
and
hard
faces
while
he
poured
into
their
ears
which
as
he
had
already
noticed
with
distress
were
large
and
not
too
clean
his
careful
disquisitions
but
it
was
all
in
vain
they
had
clearly
never
read
de
lugo
or
perrone
and
as
for
bautain
they
had
never
heard
of
him
newman
in
despair
fell
back
upon
thomas
aquinas
but
to
his
horror
he
observed
that
thomas
himself
did
not
mean
very
much
to
the
cardinals
with
a
sinking
heart
he
realised
at
last
the
painful
truth
it
was
not
the
nature
of
his
views
it
was
his
having
views
at
all
that
was
objectionable
he
had
hoped
to
devote
the
rest
of
his
life
to
the
teaching
of
theology
but
what
sort
of
theology
could
he
teach
which
would
be
acceptable
to
such
superiors
he
left
rome
and
settled
down
in
birmingham
as
the
head
of
a
small
community
of
oratorians
he
did
not
complain
it
was
god
will
it
was
better
so
he
would
watch
and
pray
but
god
will
was
not
quite
so
simple
as
that
was
it
right
after
all
that
a
man
with
newman
intellectual
gifts
his
devoted
ardour
his
personal
celebrity
should
sink
away
out
of
sight
and
use
in
the
dim
recesses
of
the
oratory
at
birmingham
if
the
call
were
to
come
to
him
to
take
his
talent
out
of
the
napkin
how
could
he
refuse
and
the
call
did
come
a
catholic
university
was
being
started
in
ireland
and
cullen
the
archbishop
of
armagh
begged
newman
to
become
the
rector
at
first
he
hesitated
but
when
he
learned
that
it
was
the
holy
wish
that
he
should
take
up
the
work
he
could
doubt
no
longer
the
offer
was
sent
from
heaven
the
difficulties
before
him
were
very
great
not
only
had
a
new
university
to
be
called
up
out
of
the
void
but
the
position
was
complicated
by
the
presence
of
a
rival
institution
the
undenominational
queen
colleges
founded
by
peel
a
few
years
earlier
with
the
object
of
giving
irish
catholics
facilities
for
university
education
on
the
same
terms
as
their
yet
newman
had
the
highest
hopes
he
dreamt
of
something
greater
than
a
merely
irish
university
of
a
noble
and
flourishing
centre
of
learning
for
the
catholics
of
ireland
and
england
alike
and
why
should
not
his
dream
come
true
the
midst
of
our
difficulties
he
said
have
one
ground
of
hope
just
one
stay
but
as
i
think
a
sufficient
one
which
serves
me
in
the
stead
of
all
other
argument
whatever
it
is
the
decision
of
the
holy
see
peter
has
spoken
the
years
that
followed
showed
to
what
extent
it
was
safe
to
depend
upon
peter
unforeseen
obstacles
cropped
up
on
every
side
energies
were
untiring
but
so
was
the
inertia
of
the
irish
authorities
on
his
appointment
he
wrote
to
cullen
asking
that
arrangements
might
be
made
for
his
reception
in
dublin
cullen
did
not
reply
newman
wrote
again
but
still
there
was
no
answer
weeks
passed
months
passed
years
passed
and
not
a
word
not
a
sign
came
from
cullen
at
last
after
dangling
for
more
than
two
years
in
the
uncertainties
and
perplexities
of
so
strange
a
situation
newman
was
summoned
to
dublin
there
he
found
nothing
but
disorder
and
discouragement
the
laity
took
no
interest
in
the
scheme
the
clergy
actively
disliked
it
authority
was
disregarded
he
appealed
to
cardinal
wiseman
and
then
at
last
a
ray
of
hope
dawned
the
cardinal
suggested
that
a
bishopric
should
be
conferred
upon
him
to
give
him
a
status
suitable
to
his
position
cullen
acquiesced
and
pius
ix
was
all
compliance
a
newman
la
crocetta
he
said
to
wiseman
smilingly
drawing
his
hands
down
each
side
of
his
neck
to
his
breast
faremo
vescovo
di
porfirio
o
qualche
luogo
the
news
spread
among
newman
friends
and
congratulations
began
to
come
in
but
the
official
intimation
seemed
to
be
unaccountably
delayed
no
crocetta
came
from
rome
and
cardinal
wiseman
never
again
referred
to
the
matter
newman
was
left
to
gather
that
the
secret
representations
of
cullen
had
brought
about
a
change
of
counsel
in
high
quarters
his
pride
did
not
allow
him
to
inquire
further
but
one
of
his
lady
penitents
miss
giberne
was
less
discreet
father
she
suddenly
said
to
the
pope
in
an
audience
one
day
do
you
make
father
newman
a
bishop
upon
which
the
holy
father
looked
much
confused
and
took
a
great
deal
of
snuff
for
the
next
five
years
newman
unaided
and
ignored
struggled
desperately
like
a
man
in
a
bog
with
the
overmastering
difficulties
of
his
task
his
mind
whose
native
haunt
was
among
the
far
aerial
boundaries
of
fancy
and
philosophy
was
now
clamped
down
under
the
fetters
of
petty
detail
and
fed
upon
the
mean
diet
of
compromise
and
routine
he
had
to
force
himself
to
scrape
together
money
to
write
articles
for
the
students
gazette
to
make
plans
for
medical
laboratories
to
be
ingratiating
with
the
city
council
he
was
obliged
to
spend
months
travelling
through
the
remote
regions
of
ireland
in
the
company
of
extraordinary
ecclesiastics
and
barbarous
squireens
he
was
a
thoroughbred
harnessed
to
a
cab
and
he
knew
it
eventually
he
realised
something
else
he
saw
that
the
whole
project
of
a
catholic
university
had
been
evolved
as
a
political
and
ecclesiastical
weapon
against
the
queen
colleges
of
peel
and
that
was
all
as
an
instrument
of
education
it
was
simply
laughed
at
and
he
himself
had
been
called
in
because
his
name
would
be
a
valuable
asset
in
a
party
game
when
he
understood
that
he
resigned
his
rectorship
and
returned
to
the
oratory
but
his
tribulations
were
not
yet
over
it
seemed
to
be
god
will
that
he
should
take
part
in
a
whole
succession
of
schemes
which
no
less
than
the
project
of
the
irish
university
were
to
end
in
disillusionment
and
failure
he
was
persuaded
by
cardinal
wiseman
to
undertake
the
editorship
of
a
new
english
version
of
the
scriptures
which
was
to
be
a
monument
of
catholic
scholarship
and
an
everlasting
glory
to
mother
church
he
made
elaborate
preparations
he
collected
subscriptions
engaged
contributors
and
composed
a
long
and
learned
prolegomena
to
the
work
it
was
all
useless
cardinal
wiseman
began
to
think
of
other
things
and
the
scheme
faded
imperceptibly
into
thin
air
then
a
new
task
was
suggested
to
him
the
rambler
a
catholic
periodical
had
fallen
on
evil
days
would
dr
newman
come
to
the
rescue
and
accept
the
editorship
this
time
he
hesitated
rather
longer
than
usual
he
had
burned
his
fingers
so
often
he
must
be
specially
careful
now
did
all
i
could
to
ascertain
god
will
he
said
and
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
his
duty
to
undertake
the
work
he
did
so
and
after
two
numbers
had
appeared
ullathorne
the
bishop
of
birmingham
called
upon
him
and
gently
hinted
that
he
had
better
leave
the
paper
alone
its
tone
was
not
liked
at
rome
it
had
contained
an
article
criticising
pius
v
and
most
serious
of
all
the
orthodoxy
of
one
of
newman
own
essays
had
appeared
to
be
doubtful
he
resigned
and
in
the
anguish
of
his
heart
determined
never
to
write
again
one
of
his
friends
asked
him
why
he
was
publishing
nothing
elephants
he
replied
could
learn
the
newman
was
now
an
old
man
he
was
years
of
age
what
had
he
to
look
forward
to
a
few
last
years
of
insignificance
and
silence
what
had
he
to
look
back
upon
a
long
chronicle
of
wasted
efforts
disappointed
hopes
neglected
possibilities
unappreciated
powers
and
now
all
his
labours
had
ended
by
his
being
accused
at
rome
of
lack
of
orthodoxy
he
could
no
longer
restrain
his
indignation
and
in
a
letter
to
one
of
his
lady
penitents
he
gave
vent
to
the
bitterness
of
his
soul
when
his
rambler
article
had
been
complained
of
he
said
there
had
been
some
talk
of
calling
him
to
rome
me
to
rome
he
burst
out
does
that
mean
it
means
to
sever
an
old
man
from
his
home
to
subject
him
to
intercourse
with
persons
whose
languages
are
strange
to
him
to
food
and
to
fashions
which
are
almost
starvation
on
the
one
hand
and
involve
restless
days
and
nights
on
the
other
it
means
to
oblige
him
to
dance
attendance
on
propaganda
week
after
week
and
month
after
month
it
means
his
death
it
was
the
punishment
on
baines
to
keep
him
at
the
door
of
propaganda
for
a
year
is
the
prospect
which
i
can
not
but
feel
probable
did
i
say
anything
which
one
bishop
in
england
chose
to
speak
against
and
report
others
have
been
killed
before
me
lucas
went
of
his
own
accord
indeed
but
when
he
got
there
oh
how
much
did
he
as
loyal
a
son
of
the
church
and
the
holy
see
as
ever
was
what
did
he
suffer
because
cullen
was
against
him
he
wandered
as
cullen
said
in
a
letter
he
published
in
a
sort
of
triumph
he
wandered
from
church
to
church
without
a
friend
and
hardly
got
an
audience
from
the
pope
i
too
should
go
from
philip
to
our
lady
and
to
peter
and
paul
and
to
laurence
and
to
cecilia
and
if
it
happened
to
me
as
to
lucas
should
come
back
to
die
yet
in
spite
of
all
in
spite
of
these
exasperations
of
the
flesh
these
agitations
of
the
spirit
what
was
there
to
regret
had
he
not
a
mysterious
consolation
which
outweighed
every
grief
surely
surely
he
had
o
lord
and
on
us
shine
in
glory
and
in
grace
he
exclaims
in
a
poem
written
at
this
time
called
two
worlds
gaudy
world
grows
pale
before
the
beauty
of
thy
face
thou
art
seen
it
seems
to
he
a
sort
of
fairy
ground
where
suns
unsetting
light
the
sky
and
flowers
and
fruit
abound
when
thy
keener
purer
beam
is
poured
upon
our
sight
it
loses
all
its
power
to
charm
and
what
was
day
is
night
thus
when
we
renounce
for
thee
its
restless
aims
and
fears
the
tender
memories
of
the
past
the
hopes
of
coming
years
is
our
sacrifice
whose
eyes
are
lighted
from
above
we
offer
what
we
can
not
keep
what
we
have
ceased
to
love
such
were
newman
thoughts
when
an
unexpected
event
occurred
which
produced
a
profound
effect
upon
his
life
charles
kingsley
attacked
his
good
faith
and
the
good
faith
of
catholics
in
general
in
a
magazine
article
newman
protested
and
kingsley
rejoined
in
an
irate
pamphlet
newman
reply
was
the
apologia
pro
vita
sua
which
he
wrote
in
seven
weeks
sometimes
working
hours
at
a
stretch
in
tears
and
constantly
crying
out
with
distress
the
success
of
the
book
with
its
transparent
candour
its
controversial
brilliance
the
sweep
and
passion
of
its
rhetoric
the
depth
of
its
personal
feeling
was
immediate
and
overwhelming
it
was
recognised
at
once
as
a
classic
not
only
by
catholics
but
by
the
whole
english
world
from
every
side
expressions
of
admiration
gratitude
and
devotion
poured
in
it
was
impossible
for
one
so
sensitive
as
newman
to
the
opinions
of
other
people
to
resist
the
happy
influence
of
such
an
such
an
enormous
triumph
the
cloud
of
his
dejection
began
to
lift
et
malgre
lui
glisse
dans
son
coeur
it
was
only
natural
that
at
such
a
moment
his
thoughts
should
return
to
oxford
for
some
years
past
proposals
had
been
on
foot
for
establishing
there
a
hall
under
newman
leadership
for
catholic
undergraduates
the
scheme
had
been
looked
upon
with
disfavour
in
rome
and
it
had
been
abandoned
but
now
a
new
opportunity
presented
itself
some
land
in
a
suitable
position
came
into
the
market
newman
with
his
reviving
spirits
felt
that
he
could
not
let
this
chance
go
by
and
bought
the
land
it
was
his
intention
to
build
there
not
a
hall
but
a
church
and
to
set
on
foot
a
of
the
oratory
what
possible
objection
could
there
be
to
such
a
scheme
he
approached
the
bishop
of
birmingham
who
gave
his
approval
in
rome
itself
there
was
no
hostile
sign
the
laity
were
enthusiastic
and
subscriptions
began
to
flow
in
was
it
possible
that
all
was
well
at
last
was
it
conceivable
that
the
strange
and
weary
pilgrimage
of
so
many
years
should
end
at
length
in
quietude
if
not
in
happiness
where
it
had
begun
it
so
happened
that
it
was
at
this
very
time
that
manning
was
appointed
to
the
see
of
westminster
the
destinies
of
the
two
men
which
had
run
parallel
to
one
another
in
so
strange
a
fashion
and
for
so
many
years
were
now
for
a
moment
suddenly
to
converge
newly
clothed
with
all
the
attributes
of
ecclesiastical
supremacy
manning
found
himself
face
to
face
with
newman
upon
whose
brows
were
glittering
the
fresh
laurels
of
spiritual
victory
the
crown
of
an
apostolical
life
it
was
the
meeting
of
the
eagle
and
the
dove
what
followed
showed
more
clearly
perhaps
than
any
other
incident
in
his
career
the
stuff
that
manning
was
made
of
power
had
come
to
him
at
last
and
he
seized
it
with
all
the
avidity
of
a
born
autocrat
whose
appetite
for
supreme
dominion
had
been
whetted
by
long
years
of
enforced
abstinence
and
the
hated
simulations
of
submission
he
was
the
ruler
of
roman
catholic
england
and
he
would
rule
the
nature
of
newman
influence
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
understand
but
he
saw
that
it
existed
for
twenty
years
he
had
been
unable
to
escape
the
unwelcome
iterations
of
that
singular
that
alien
that
rival
renown
and
now
it
stood
in
his
path
alone
and
inexplicable
like
a
defiant
ghost
is
remarkably
interesting
he
observed
coldly
when
somebody
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
the
apologia
is
like
listening
to
the
voice
of
one
from
the
dead
and
such
voices
with
their
sepulchral
echoes
are
apt
to
be
more
dangerous
than
living
ones
they
attract
too
much
attention
they
must
be
silenced
at
all
costs
it
was
the
meeting
of
the
eagle
and
the
dove
there
was
a
hovering
a
swoop
and
then
the
quick
beak
and
the
relentless
talons
did
their
work
even
before
his
accession
to
the
archbishopric
manning
had
scented
a
peculiar
peril
in
newman
oxford
scheme
and
so
soon
as
he
came
into
power
he
privately
determined
that
the
author
of
the
apologia
should
never
be
allowed
to
return
to
his
old
university
nor
was
there
any
lack
of
excellent
reasons
for
such
a
decision
oxford
was
by
this
time
a
nest
of
liberalism
it
was
no
fit
place
for
catholic
youths
and
they
would
inevitably
be
attracted
there
by
the
presence
of
father
newman
and
then
had
not
father
newman
orthodoxy
been
impugned
had
he
not
been
heard
to
express
opinions
of
most
doubtful
propriety
upon
the
question
of
the
temporal
power
was
it
not
known
that
he
might
almost
be
said
to
have
an
independent
mind
an
influence
yes
he
had
an
influence
no
doubt
but
what
a
fatal
kind
of
influence
to
which
to
subject
the
rising
generation
of
catholic
englishmen
such
were
the
reflections
which
manning
was
careful
to
pour
into
the
receptive
car
of
monsignor
talbot
that
useful
priest
at
his
post
of
vantage
in
the
vatican
was
more
than
ever
the
devoted
servant
of
the
new
archbishop
a
league
offensive
and
defensive
had
been
established
between
the
two
friends
daresay
i
shall
have
many
opportunities
to
serve
you
in
rome
wrote
monsignor
talbot
modestly
i
do
not
think
any
support
will
be
useless
to
you
especially
on
account
of
the
peculiar
character
of
the
pope
and
the
spirit
which
pervades
propaganda
therefore
i
wish
you
to
understand
that
a
compact
exists
between
us
if
you
help
me
i
shall
help
you
and
a
little
later
he
added
am
glad
you
accept
the
league
as
i
have
already
done
for
years
i
shall
support
you
and
i
have
a
hundred
ways
of
doing
so
a
word
dropped
at
the
proper
occasion
works
wonders
perhaps
it
was
hardly
necessary
to
remind
his
correspondent
of
that
so
far
as
newman
was
concerned
it
so
fell
out
that
monsignor
talbot
needed
no
prompting
during
the
sensation
caused
by
the
appearance
of
the
apologia
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
be
an
excellent
plan
to
secure
newman
as
a
preacher
during
lent
for
the
fashionable
congregation
which
attended
his
church
in
the
piazza
del
popolo
and
he
had
accordingly
written
to
invite
him
to
rome
his
letter
was
unfortunately
not
a
tactful
one
he
assured
newman
that
he
would
find
in
the
piazza
del
popolo
audience
of
protestants
more
educated
than
could
ever
be
the
case
in
england
and
think
myself
he
had
added
by
way
of
extra
inducement
you
will
derive
great
benefit
from
visiting
rome
and
showing
yourself
to
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
newman
smiled
grimly
at
this
he
declared
to
a
friend
that
the
letter
was
and
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
using
his
sharp
pen
monsignor
talbot
he
wrote
in
reply
have
received
your
letter
inviting
me
to
preach
in
your
church
at
rome
to
an
audience
of
protestants
more
educated
than
could
ever
be
the
case
in
england
birmingham
people
have
souls
and
i
have
neither
taste
nor
talent
for
the
sort
of
work
which
you
cut
out
for
me
and
i
beg
to
decline
your
offer
i
am
yours
truly
john
h
newman
such
words
were
not
the
words
of
wisdom
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
feelings
of
monsignor
talbot
work
none
here
can
understand
he
burst
out
to
his
friend
man
by
living
almost
ever
since
he
has
been
a
catholic
surrounded
by
a
set
of
inferior
men
who
idolise
him
i
do
not
think
he
has
ever
acquired
the
catholic
instincts
as
for
his
views
on
the
temporal
power
people
said
that
he
had
actually
sent
a
subscription
to
garibaldi
yes
the
man
was
incomprehensible
heretical
dangerous
he
was
uncatholic
and
unchristian
monsignor
talbot
even
trembled
for
the
position
of
manning
in
england
am
afraid
that
the
old
school
of
catholics
will
rally
round
newman
in
opposition
to
you
and
rome
stand
firm
do
not
yield
a
bit
in
the
line
you
have
taken
as
i
have
promised
i
shall
stand
by
you
you
will
have
battles
to
fight
because
every
englishman
is
naturally
to
be
roman
is
an
effort
to
an
englishman
an
effort
newman
is
more
english
than
the
english
his
spirit
must
be
crushed
his
spirit
must
be
crushed
certainly
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
that
you
write
about
dr
newman
manning
replied
true
whether
he
knows
it
or
not
he
has
become
the
centre
of
those
who
hold
low
views
about
the
holy
see
are
cold
and
silent
to
say
no
more
about
the
temporal
power
national
english
critical
of
catholic
devotions
and
always
on
the
lower
side
you
will
take
care
he
concluded
things
are
correctly
known
and
understood
where
you
are
the
confederates
matured
their
plans
while
newman
was
making
his
arrangements
for
the
oxford
oratory
cardinal
reisach
visited
london
reisach
has
just
left
wrote
manning
to
monsignor
talbot
has
seen
and
understands
all
that
is
going
on
in
england
but
newman
had
no
suspicions
it
was
true
that
persistent
rumours
of
his
unorthodoxy
and
his
leanings
had
begun
to
float
about
and
these
rumours
had
been
traced
to
rome
but
what
were
rumours
then
too
newman
found
out
that
cardinal
reisach
had
been
to
oxford
without
his
knowledge
and
had
inspected
the
land
for
the
oratory
that
seemed
odd
but
all
doubts
were
set
at
rest
by
the
arrival
from
propaganda
of
an
official
ratification
of
his
scheme
there
would
be
nothing
but
plain
sailing
now
newman
was
almost
happy
radiant
visions
came
into
his
mind
of
a
wonderful
future
in
oxford
the
gradual
growth
of
catholic
principles
the
decay
of
liberalism
the
inauguration
of
a
second
oxford
movement
the
conversion
who
knows
of
mark
pattison
the
triumph
of
the
church
failures
do
not
matter
now
he
exclaimed
to
a
friend
see
that
i
have
been
reserved
by
god
for
this
just
then
a
long
blue
envelope
was
brought
into
the
room
newman
opened
it
is
over
he
said
am
not
allowed
to
go
the
envelope
contained
a
letter
from
the
bishop
announcing
that
together
with
the
formal
permission
for
an
oratory
at
oxford
propaganda
had
issued
a
secret
instruction
to
the
effect
that
newman
himself
was
by
no
means
to
reside
there
if
he
showed
signs
of
doing
so
he
was
blandly
and
suavely
suaviterque
were
the
words
of
the
latin
instrument
to
be
prevented
and
now
the
secret
instruction
had
come
into
operation
blande
suaviterque
newman
spirit
had
been
crushed
his
friends
made
some
gallant
efforts
to
retrieve
the
situation
but
it
was
in
vain
father
john
hurried
to
rome
and
the
indignant
laity
of
england
headed
by
lord
edward
howard
the
guardian
of
the
young
duke
of
norfolk
seized
the
opportunity
of
a
particularly
virulent
anonymous
attack
upon
newman
to
send
him
an
address
in
which
they
expressed
their
feeling
that
blow
that
touches
you
inflicts
a
wound
upon
the
catholic
church
in
this
country
the
only
result
was
an
outburst
of
redoubled
fury
upon
the
part
of
monsignor
talbot
the
address
he
declared
was
an
insult
to
the
holy
see
is
the
province
of
the
laity
he
interjected
hunt
to
shoot
to
entertain
these
matters
they
understand
but
to
meddle
with
ecclesiastical
matters
they
have
no
right
at
all
once
more
he
warned
manning
to
be
careful
newman
is
the
most
dangerous
man
in
england
and
you
will
see
that
he
will
make
use
of
the
laity
against
your
grace
you
must
not
be
afraid
of
him
it
will
require
much
prudence
but
you
must
be
firm
the
holy
father
still
places
his
confidence
in
you
but
if
you
yield
and
do
not
fight
the
battle
of
the
holy
see
against
the
detestable
spirit
growing
up
in
england
he
will
begin
to
regret
cardinal
wiseman
who
knew
how
to
keep
the
laity
in
order
manning
had
no
thought
of
but
he
pointed
out
to
his
agitated
friend
that
an
open
conflict
between
himself
and
newman
would
be
great
a
scandal
to
the
church
in
england
and
as
great
a
victory
to
the
anglicans
as
could
be
he
would
act
quietly
and
there
would
be
no
more
difficulty
the
bishops
were
united
and
the
church
was
sound
on
this
monsignor
talbot
hurried
to
father
john
lodgings
in
rome
to
express
his
regret
at
the
misunderstanding
that
had
arisen
to
wonder
how
it
could
possibly
have
occurred
and
to
hope
that
newman
might
consent
to
be
made
a
protonotary
apostolic
that
was
all
the
satisfaction
that
father
john
was
to
obtain
from
his
visit
to
rome
a
few
weeks
later
the
scheme
of
the
oxford
oratory
was
finally
quashed
when
all
was
over
manning
thought
that
the
time
had
come
for
a
reconciliation
he
made
advances
through
a
common
friend
what
had
he
done
he
asked
to
offend
newman
letters
passed
and
naturally
enough
they
only
widened
the
breach
newman
was
not
the
man
to
be
polite
can
only
repeat
he
wrote
at
last
i
said
when
you
last
heard
from
me
i
do
not
know
whether
i
am
on
my
head
or
my
heels
when
i
have
active
relations
with
you
in
spite
of
my
friendly
feelings
this
is
the
judgment
of
my
intellect
he
concluded
propose
to
say
seven
masses
for
your
intention
amid
the
difficulties
and
anxieties
of
your
ecclesiastical
duties
and
manning
could
only
return
the
compliment
at
about
this
time
the
curate
of
littlemore
had
a
singular
experience
as
he
was
passing
by
the
church
he
noticed
an
old
man
very
poorly
dressed
in
an
old
grey
coat
with
the
collar
turned
up
leaning
over
the
lych
gate
in
floods
of
tears
he
was
apparently
in
great
trouble
and
his
hat
was
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
as
if
he
wished
to
hide
his
features
for
a
moment
however
he
turned
towards
the
curate
who
was
suddenly
struck
by
something
familiar
in
the
face
could
it
be
a
photograph
hung
over
the
curate
mantelpiece
of
the
man
who
had
made
littlemore
famous
by
his
sojourn
there
more
than
twenty
years
ago
he
had
never
seen
the
original
but
now
was
it
possible
he
looked
again
and
he
could
doubt
no
longer
it
was
newman
he
sprang
forward
with
proffers
of
assistance
could
he
be
of
any
use
no
no
was
the
reply
no
no
but
the
curate
felt
that
he
could
not
run
away
and
leave
so
eminent
a
character
in
such
distress
it
not
newman
he
had
the
honour
of
addressing
he
asked
with
all
the
respect
and
sympathy
at
his
command
there
nothing
that
could
be
done
but
the
old
man
hardly
seemed
to
understand
what
was
being
said
to
him
no
no
he
repeated
with
the
tears
streaming
down
his
face
no
no
vii
meanwhile
a
remarkable
problem
was
absorbing
the
attention
of
the
catholic
church
once
more
for
a
moment
the
eyes
of
all
christendom
were
fixed
upon
rome
the
temporal
power
of
the
pope
had
now
almost
vanished
but
as
his
worldly
dominions
steadily
diminished
the
spiritual
pretensions
of
the
holy
father
no
less
steadily
increased
for
seven
centuries
the
immaculate
conception
of
the
virgin
had
been
highly
problematical
pio
nono
spoke
and
the
doctrine
became
an
article
of
faith
a
few
years
later
the
court
of
rome
took
another
step
a
syllabus
errorum
was
issued
in
which
all
the
favourite
beliefs
of
the
modern
world
the
rights
of
democracies
the
claims
of
science
the
sanctity
of
free
speech
the
principles
of
toleration
were
categorically
denounced
and
their
supporters
abandoned
to
the
divine
wrath
yet
it
was
observed
that
the
modern
world
proceeded
as
before
something
more
drastic
appeared
to
be
necessary
some
bold
and
striking
measure
which
should
concentrate
the
forces
of
the
faithful
and
confound
their
enemies
the
tremendous
doctrine
of
papal
infallibility
beloved
of
all
good
catholics
seemed
to
offer
just
the
opening
that
was
required
let
that
doctrine
be
proclaimed
with
the
assent
of
the
whole
church
an
article
of
faith
and
in
the
face
of
such
an
affirmation
let
the
modern
world
do
its
worst
accordingly
a
general
council
the
first
to
be
held
since
the
council
of
trent
more
than
years
before
was
summoned
to
the
vatican
for
the
purpose
so
it
was
announced
of
providing
adequate
remedy
to
the
disorders
intellectual
and
moral
of
christendom
the
programme
might
seem
a
large
one
even
for
a
general
council
but
everyone
knew
what
it
meant
everyone
however
was
not
quite
of
one
mind
there
were
those
to
whom
even
the
mysteries
of
infallibility
caused
some
searchings
of
heart
it
was
true
no
doubt
that
our
lord
by
saying
to
peter
art
cephas
which
is
by
interpretation
a
stone
thereby
endowed
that
apostle
with
the
supreme
and
full
primacy
and
principality
over
the
universal
catholic
church
it
was
equally
certain
that
peter
afterwards
became
the
bishop
of
rome
nor
could
it
be
doubted
that
the
roman
pontiff
was
his
successor
thus
it
followed
directly
that
the
roman
pontiff
was
the
head
heart
mind
and
tongue
of
the
catholic
church
and
moreover
it
was
plain
that
when
our
lord
prayed
for
peter
that
his
faith
should
not
fail
that
prayer
implied
the
doctrine
of
papal
infallibility
all
these
things
were
obvious
and
yet
and
yet
might
not
the
formal
declaration
of
such
truths
in
the
year
of
his
grace
be
to
say
the
least
of
it
inopportune
might
it
not
come
as
an
offence
as
a
scandal
even
to
those
unacquainted
with
the
niceties
of
catholic
dogma
such
were
the
uneasy
reflections
of
grave
and
learned
ecclesiastics
and
theologians
in
england
france
and
germany
newman
was
more
than
usually
upset
monseigneur
dupanloup
was
disgusted
and
dollinger
prepared
himself
for
resistance
it
was
clear
that
there
would
be
a
disaffected
minority
at
the
council
catholic
apologists
have
often
argued
that
the
pope
claim
to
infallibility
implies
no
more
than
the
necessary
claim
of
every
ruler
of
every
government
to
the
right
of
supreme
command
in
england
for
instance
the
estates
of
the
realm
exercise
an
absolute
authority
in
secular
matters
no
one
questions
this
authority
no
one
suggests
that
it
is
absurd
or
exorbitant
in
other
words
by
general
consent
the
estates
of
the
realm
are
within
their
sphere
infallible
why
therefore
should
the
pope
within
his
sphere
the
sphere
of
the
catholic
church
be
denied
a
similar
infallibility
if
there
is
nothing
monstrous
in
an
act
of
parliament
laying
down
what
all
men
shall
do
why
should
there
be
anything
monstrous
in
a
papal
encyclical
laying
down
what
all
men
shall
believe
the
argument
is
simple
in
fact
it
is
too
simple
for
it
takes
for
granted
the
very
question
which
is
in
dispute
is
there
indeed
no
radical
and
essential
distinction
between
supremacy
and
infallibility
between
the
right
of
a
borough
council
to
regulate
the
traffic
and
the
right
of
the
vicar
of
christ
to
decide
upon
the
qualifications
for
everlasting
bliss
there
is
one
distinction
at
any
rate
which
is
palpable
the
decisions
of
a
supreme
authority
can
be
altered
those
of
an
infallible
authority
can
not
a
borough
council
may
change
its
traffic
regulations
at
the
next
meeting
but
the
vicar
of
christ
when
in
certain
circumstances
and
with
certain
precautions
he
has
once
spoken
has
expressed
for
all
the
ages
a
part
of
the
immutable
absolute
and
eternal
truth
it
is
this
that
makes
the
papal
pretensions
so
extraordinary
and
so
enormous
it
is
also
this
that
gives
them
their
charm
catholic
apologists
when
they
try
to
tone
down
those
pretensions
and
to
explain
them
away
forget
that
it
is
in
their
very
exorbitance
that
their
fascination
lies
if
the
pope
were
indeed
nothing
more
than
a
magnified
borough
councillor
we
should
hardly
have
heard
so
much
of
him
it
is
not
because
he
satisfies
the
reason
but
because
he
astounds
it
that
men
abase
themselves
before
the
vicar
of
christ
and
certainly
the
doctrine
of
papal
infallibility
presents
to
the
reason
a
sufficiency
of
in
the
fourteenth
century
for
instance
the
following
case
arose
john
xxii
asserted
in
his
bull
inter
nonnullos
that
the
doctrine
of
the
poverty
of
christ
was
heretical
now
according
to
the
light
of
reason
one
of
two
things
must
follow
from
this
either
john
xxii
was
himself
a
heretic
or
he
was
no
pope
for
his
predecessor
nicholas
iii
had
asserted
in
his
bull
qui
seminat
that
the
doctrine
of
the
poverty
of
christ
was
the
true
doctrine
the
denial
of
which
was
heresy
thus
if
john
xxii
was
right
nicholas
iii
was
a
heretic
and
in
that
case
nicholas
nominations
of
cardinals
were
void
and
the
conclave
which
elected
john
was
illegal
so
that
john
was
no
pope
his
nominations
of
cardinals
were
void
and
the
whole
papal
succession
vitiated
on
the
other
hand
if
john
was
wrong
well
he
was
a
heretic
and
the
same
inconvenient
results
followed
and
in
either
case
what
becomes
of
papal
infallibility
but
such
crude
and
fundamental
questions
as
these
were
not
likely
to
trouble
the
council
the
discordant
minority
took
another
line
infallibility
they
admitted
readily
enough
the
infallibility
that
is
to
say
of
the
church
what
they
shrank
from
was
the
pronouncement
that
this
infallibility
was
concentrated
in
the
bishop
of
rome
they
would
not
actually
deny
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
so
concentrated
but
to
declare
that
it
was
to
make
the
belief
that
it
was
an
article
of
faith
what
could
be
more
it
was
their
favourite
expression
more
inopportune
in
truth
the
gallican
spirit
still
lingered
among
them
at
heart
they
hated
the
autocracy
of
rome
the
domination
of
the
centralised
italian
organisation
over
the
whole
vast
body
of
the
church
they
secretly
hankered
even
at
this
late
hour
after
some
form
of
constitutional
government
and
they
knew
that
the
last
faint
vestige
of
such
a
dream
would
vanish
utterly
with
the
declaration
of
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
it
did
not
occur
to
them
apparently
that
a
constitutional
catholicism
might
be
a
contradiction
in
terms
and
that
the
catholic
church
without
the
absolute
dominion
of
the
pope
might
resemble
the
play
of
hamlet
without
the
prince
of
denmark
pius
ix
himself
was
troubled
by
doubts

was
pope
he

now
i
feel
it
as
for
manning
his
certainty
was
no
less
complete
than
his
master
apart
from
the
holy
ghost
his
appointment
to
the
see
of
westminster
had
been
due
to
pio
nono
shrewd
appreciation
of
the
fact
that
he
was
the
one
man
in
england
upon
whose
fidelity
the
roman
government
could
absolutely
rely
the
voice
which
kept
repeating
li
mettetelo

in
his
holiness
ear
whether
or
not
it
was
inspired
by
god
was
certainly
inspired
by
political
sagacity
for
now
manning
was
to
show
that
he
was
not
unworthy
of
the
trust
which
had
been
reposed
in
him
he
flew
to
rome
in
a
whirlwind
of
papal
enthusiasm
on
the
way
in
paris
he
stopped
for
a
moment
to
interview
those
two
great
props
of
french
respectability
guizot
and
thiers
both
were
careful
not
to
commit
themselves
but
both
were
exceedingly
polite
am
awaiting
your
council
said
guizot
great
anxiety
it
is
the
last
great
moral
power
and
may
restore
the
peace
of
europe
thiers
delivered
a
brief
harangue
in
favour
of
the
principles
of
the
revolution
which
he
declared
were
the
very
marrow
of
all
frenchmen
yet
he
added
he
had
always
supported
the
temporal
power
of
the
pope
thiers
said
manning
etes
effectivement
croyant
dieu
replied
thiers
the
rome
which
manning
reached
towards
the
close
of
was
still
the
rome
which
for
so
many
centuries
had
been
the
proud
and
visible
apex
the
palpitating
heart
the
sacred
sanctuary
of
the
most
extraordinary
mingling
of
spiritual
and
earthly
powers
that
the
world
has
ever
known
the
pope
now
it
is
true
ruled
over
little
more
than
the
city
itself
the
patrimony
of
peter
and
he
ruled
there
less
by
the
grace
of
god
than
by
the
goodwill
of
napoleon
iii
yet
he
was
still
a
sovereign
prince
and
rome
was
still
the
capital
of
the
papal
state
she
was
not
yet
the
capital
of
italy
the
last
hour
of
this
strange
dominion
had
almost
struck
as
if
she
knew
that
her
doom
was
upon
her
the
eternal
city
arrayed
herself
to
meet
it
in
all
her
glory
the
whole
world
seemed
to
be
gathered
together
within
her
walls
her
streets
were
filled
with
crowned
heads
and
princes
of
the
church
great
ladies
and
great
theologians
artists
and
friars
diplomats
and
newspaper
reporters
seven
hundred
bishops
were
there
from
all
the
corners
of
christendom
and
in
all
the
varieties
of
ecclesiastical
magnificence
in
falling
lace
and
sweeping
purple
and
flowing
violet
veils
zouaves
stood
in
the
colonnade
of
st
peter
and
papal
troops
were
on
the
quirinal
cardinals
passed
hatted
and
robed
in
their
enormous
carriage
of
state
like
mysterious
painted
idols
then
there
was
a
sudden
hush
the
crowd
grew
thicker
and
expectation
filled
the
air
yes
it
was
he
he
was
coming
the
holy
father
but
first
there
appeared
mounted
on
a
white
mule
and
clothed
in
a
magenta
mantle
a
grave
dignitary
bearing
aloft
a
silver
cross
the
golden
coach
followed
drawn
by
six
horses
gorgeously
caparisoned
and
within
the
smiling
pio
nono
scattering
his
benedictions
while
the
multitude
fell
upon
its
knees
as
one
man
such
were
the
daily
spectacles
of
coloured
pomp
and
of
antique
solemnity
which
so
long
as
the
sun
was
shining
at
any
rate
dazzled
the
onlooker
into
a
happy
forgetfulness
of
the
reverse
side
of
the
papal
dispensation
the
nauseating
filth
of
the
highways
the
cattle
stabled
in
the
palaces
of
the
great
and
the
fever
flitting
through
the
ghastly
tenements
of
the
poor
in
peter
the
north
transept
had
been
screened
off
rows
of
wooden
seats
had
been
erected
covered
with
brussels
carpet
and
upon
these
seats
sat
each
crowned
with
a
white
mitre
the
bishops
in
council
here
all
day
long
rolled
forth
in
sonorous
latin
the
interminable
periods
of
episcopal
oratory
but
it
was
not
here
that
the
issue
of
the
council
was
determined
the
assembled
fathers
might
talk
till
the
marbles
of
peter
themselves
grew
weary
of
the
reverberations
the
fate
of
the
church
was
decided
in
a
very
different
manner
by
little
knots
of
influential
persons
meeting
quietly
of
a
morning
in
the
back
room
of
some
inconspicuous
by
a
sunset
rendezvous
in
the
borghese
gardens
between
a
cardinal
and
a
diplomatist
by
a
whispered
conference
in
an
alcove
at
a
princess
evening
party
with
the
gay
world
chattering
all
about
and
of
course
on
such
momentous
occasions
as
these
manning
was
in
his
element
none
knew
those
difficult
ropes
better
than
he
none
used
them
with
a
more
serviceable
and
yet
discreet
alacrity
in
every
juncture
he
had
the
right
word
or
the
right
silence
his
influence
ramified
in
all
directions
from
the
pope
audience
chamber
to
the
english
cabinet
diavolo
del
concilio
his
enemies
called
him
and
he
gloried
in
the
name
the
real
crux
of
the
position
was
less
ecclesiastical
than
diplomatic
the
papal
court
with
its
huge
majority
of
italian
bishops
could
make
sure
enough
when
it
came
to
the
point
of
carrying
its
wishes
through
the
council
what
was
far
more
dubious
was
the
attitude
of
the
foreign
governments
especially
those
of
france
and
england
the
french
government
dreaded
a
schism
among
its
catholic
subjects
it
disliked
the
prospect
of
an
extension
of
the
influence
of
the
pope
over
the
mass
of
the
population
of
france
and
since
the
very
existence
of
the
last
remnant
of
the
pope
temporal
power
depended
upon
the
french
army
it
was
able
to
apply
considerable
pressure
upon
the
vatican
the
interests
of
england
were
less
directly
involved
but
it
happened
that
at
this
moment
gladstone
was
prime
minister
and
gladstone
entertained
strong
views
upon
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
his
opinions
upon
the
subject
were
in
part
the
outcome
of
his
friendship
with
lord
acton
a
historian
to
whom
learning
and
judgment
had
not
been
granted
in
equal
proportions
and
who
after
years
of
incredible
and
indeed
mythical
research
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
pope
could
err
in
this
gladstone
entirely
concurred
though
he
did
not
share
the
rest
of
his
friend
theological
opinions
for
lord
acton
while
straining
at
the
gnat
of
infallibility
had
swallowed
the
camel
of
the
roman
catholic
faith
diable
faire
dans
cette
galere
one
can
not
help
asking
as
one
watched
that
laborious
and
scrupulous
scholar
that
lifelong
enthusiast
for
liberty
that
almost
hysterical
reviler
of
priesthood
and
persecution
trailing
his
learning
so
discrepantly
along
the
dusty
roman
way
but
there
are
some
who
know
how
to
wear
their
rome
with
a
difference
and
lord
acton
was
one
of
these
he
was
now
engaged
in
fluttering
like
a
moth
round
the
council
and
in
writing
long
letters
to
gladstone
impressing
upon
him
the
gravity
of
the
situation
and
urging
him
to
bring
his
influence
to
bear
if
the
dogma
were
carried
he
declared
no
man
who
accepted
it
could
remain
a
loyal
subject
and
catholics
would
everywhere
become
enemies
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
in
these
circumstances
was
it
not
plainly
incumbent
upon
the
english
government
involved
as
it
was
with
the
powerful
roman
catholic
forces
in
ireland
to
intervene
gladstone
allowed
himself
to
become
convinced
and
lord
acton
began
to
hope
that
his
efforts
would
be
successful
but
he
had
forgotten
one
element
in
the
situation
he
had
reckoned
without
the
archbishop
of
westminster
the
sharp
nose
of
manning
sniffed
out
the
whole
intrigue
though
he
despised
lord
acton
almost
as
much
as
he
disliked
him
men
he
said
all
vanity
they
have
the
inflation
of
german
professors
and
the
ruthless
talk
of
undergraduates
yet
he
realised
clearly
enough
the
danger
of
his
correspondence
with
the
prime
minister
and
immediately
took
steps
to
counteract
it
there
was
a
agent
of
the
english
government
in
rome
odo
russell
and
around
him
manning
set
to
work
to
spin
his
spider
web
of
delicate
and
clinging
diplomacy
preliminary
politenesses
were
followed
by
long
walks
upon
the
pincio
and
the
gradual
interchange
of
more
and
more
important
and
confidential
communications
soon
poor
russell
was
little
better
than
a
fly
buzzing
in
gossamer
and
manning
was
careful
to
see
that
he
buzzed
on
the
right
note
in
his
dispatches
to
the
foreign
secretary
lord
clarendon
russell
explained
in
detail
the
true
nature
of
the
council
that
it
was
merely
a
meeting
of
a
few
roman
catholic
prelates
to
discuss
some
internal
matters
of
church
discipline
that
it
had
no
political
significance
whatever
that
the
question
of
infallibility
about
which
there
had
been
so
much
random
talk
was
a
purely
theological
question
and
that
whatever
decision
might
be
come
to
on
the
subject
the
position
of
roman
catholics
throughout
the
world
would
remain
unchanged
whether
the
effect
of
these
affirmations
upon
lord
clarendon
was
as
great
as
manning
supposed
is
somewhat
doubtful
but
it
is
at
any
rate
certain
that
gladstone
failed
to
carry
the
cabinet
with
him
and
when
at
last
a
proposal
was
definitely
made
that
the
english
government
should
invite
the
powers
of
europe
to
intervene
at
the
vatican
it
was
rejected
manning
always
believed
that
this
was
the
direct
result
of
russell
dispatches
which
had
acted
as
an
antidote
to
the
poison
of
lord
acton
letters
and
thus
carried
the
day
if
that
was
so
the
discretion
of
biographers
has
not
yet
entirely
lifted
the
veil
from
these
proceedings
manning
had
assuredly
performed
no
small
service
for
his
cause
yet
his
modesty
would
not
allow
him
to
assume
for
himself
a
credit
which
after
all
was
due
elsewhere
and
when
he
told
the
story
of
those
days
he
would
add
with
more
than
wonted
seriousness
was
by
the
divine
will
that
the
designs
of
his
enemies
were
frustrated
meanwhile
in
the
north
transept
of
peter
a
certain
amount
of
preliminary
business
had
been
carried
through
various
miscellaneous
points
in
christian
doctrine
had
been
satisfactorily
determined
among
others
the
following
canons
were
laid
down
by
the
fathers
anyone
does
not
accept
for
sacred
and
canonical
the
whole
and
every
part
of
the
books
of
holy
scripture
or
deny
that
they
are
divinely
inspired
let
him
be
anathema
anyone
says
that
miracles
can
not
be
and
therefore
the
accounts
of
them
even
those
in
holy
scriptures
must
be
assigned
a
place
among
fables
and
myths
or
that
the
divine
origin
of
the
christian
religion
can
not
rightly
be
proved
from
them
let
him
be
anathema
anyone
says
that
the
doctrines
of
the
church
can
ever
receive
a
sense
in
accordance
with
the
progress
of
science
other
than
that
sense
which
the
church
has
understood
and
still
understands
let
him
be
anathema
anyone
says
that
it
is
not
possible
by
the
natural
light
of
human
reason
to
acquire
a
certain
knowledge
of
the
one
and
true
god
let
him
be
anathema
in
other
words
it
became
an
article
of
faith
that
faith
was
not
necessary
for
a
true
knowledge
of
god
having
disposed
of
these
minor
matters
the
fathers
found
themselves
at
last
approaching
the
great
question
of
infallibility
two
main
issues
it
soon
appeared
were
before
them
the
infallibility
was
admitted
ostensibly
at
least
by
all
what
remained
to
be
determined
was
whether
the
definition
of
the
infallibility
was
opportune
and
what
the
definition
of
the
infallibility
was
it
soon
became
clear
that
the
sense
of
the
council
was
overwhelmingly
in
favour
of
a
definition
the
inopportunists
were
a
small
minority
they
were
outvoted
and
they
were
obliged
to
give
way
it
only
remained
therefore
to
come
to
a
decision
upon
the
second
question
what
the
definition
should
actually
be
it
now
became
the
object
of
the
inopportunists
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
definition
as
much
as
possible
while
the
infallibilists
were
no
less
eager
to
extend
it
now
everyone
or
nearly
everyone
was
ready
to
limit
the
papal
infallibility
to
pronouncements
ex
cathedra
that
is
to
say
to
those
made
by
the
pope
in
his
capacity
of
universal
doctor
but
this
only
served
to
raise
the
ulterior
the
portentous
and
indeed
the
really
crucial
question
to
which
of
the
papal
pronouncements
ex
cathedra
did
infallibility
adhere
the
discussions
which
followed
were
naturally
enough
numerous
complicated
and
embittered
and
in
all
of
them
manning
played
a
conspicuous
part
for
two
months
the
fathers
deliberated
through
fifty
sessions
they
sought
the
guidance
of
the
holy
ghost
the
wooden
seats
covered
though
they
were
with
brussels
carpet
grew
harder
and
harder
and
still
the
mitred
councillors
sat
on
the
pope
himself
began
to
grow
impatient
for
one
thing
he
declared
he
was
being
ruined
by
the
mere
expense
of
lodging
and
keeping
the
multitude
of
his
adherents
infallibilisti
mi
faranno
fallire
said
his
holiness
at
length
it
appeared
that
the
inopportunists
were
dragging
out
the
proceedings
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
an
indefinite
postponement
then
the
authorities
began
to
act
a
bishop
was
shouted
down
and
the
closure
was
brought
into
operation
at
this
point
the
french
government
after
long
hesitation
finally
decided
to
intervene
and
cardinal
antonelli
was
informed
that
if
the
definition
was
proceeded
with
the
french
troops
would
be
withdrawn
from
rome
but
the
astute
cardinal
judged
that
he
could
safely
ignore
the
threat
he
saw
that
napoleon
iii
was
tottering
to
his
fall
and
would
never
risk
an
open
rupture
with
the
vatican
accordingly
it
was
determined
to
bring
the
proceedings
to
a
close
by
a
final
vote
already
the
inopportunists
seeing
that
the
game
was
up
had
shaken
the
dust
of
rome
from
their
feet
on
july
the
council
met
for
the
last
time
as
the
first
of
the
fathers
stepped
forward
to
declare
his
vote
a
storm
of
thunder
and
lightning
suddenly
burst
over
peter
all
through
the
morning
the
voting
continued
and
every
vote
was
accompanied
by
a
flash
and
a
roar
from
heaven
both
sides
with
equal
justice
claimed
the
portent
as
a
manifestation
of
the
divine
opinion
when
the
votes
were
examined
it
was
found
that
were
in
favour
of
the
proposed
definition
and
two
against
it
next
day
war
was
declared
between
france
and
germany
and
a
few
weeks
later
the
french
troops
were
withdrawn
from
rome
almost
in
the
same
moment
the
successor
of
peter
had
lost
his
temporal
power
and
gained
infallibility
what
the
council
had
done
was
merely
to
assent
to
a
definition
of
the
dogma
of
the
infallibility
of
the
roman
pontiff
which
pius
ix
had
issued
proprio
motu
a
few
days
before
the
definition
itself
was
perhaps
somewhat
less
extreme
than
might
have
been
expected
the
pope
it
declared
is
possessed
when
he
speaks
ex
cathedra
of
infallibility
with
which
the
redeemer
willed
that
his
church
should
be
endowed
for
defining
doctrine
regarding
faith
or
morals
thus
it
became
a
dogma
of
faith
that
a
papal
definition
regarding
faith
or
morals
is
infallible
but
beyond
that
both
the
holy
father
and
the
council
maintained
a
judicious
reserve
over
what
other
matters
besides
faith
and
morals
the
papal
infallibility
might
or
might
not
extend
still
remained
in
doubt
and
there
were
further
questions
no
less
serious
to
which
no
decisive
answer
was
then
or
ever
has
been
since
provided
how
was
it
to
be
determined
for
instance
which
particular
papal
decisions
did
in
fact
come
within
the
scope
of
the
definition
who
was
to
decide
what
was
or
was
not
a
matter
of
faith
or
morals
or
precisely
when
the
roman
pontiff
was
speaking
ex
cathedra
was
the
famous
syllabus
errorum
for
example
issued
ex
cathedra
or
not
grave
theologians
have
never
been
able
to
make
up
their
minds
yet
to
admit
doubts
in
such
matters
as
these
is
surely
dangerous
duty
to
our
supreme
pastoral
office
proclaimed
the
sovereign
pontiff
the
bowels
of
christ
we
earnestly
entreat
all
christ
faithful
people
and
we
also
command
them
by
the
authority
of
god
and
our
saviour
that
they
study
and
labour
to
expel
and
eliminate
errors
and
display
the
light
of
the
purest
faith
well
might
the
faithful
study
and
labour
to
such
ends
for
while
the
offence
remained
ambiguous
there
was
no
ambiguity
about
the
penalty
one
from
the
unknown
path
of
truth
one
shadow
of
impurity
in
the
mysterious
light
of
faith
and
there
shall
be
anathema
anathema
anathema
when
the
framers
of
such
edicts
called
upon
the
bowels
of
christ
to
justify
them
might
they
not
have
done
well
to
have
paused
a
little
and
to
have
called
to
mind
the
counsel
of
another
sovereign
ruler
though
a
heretic
oliver
cromwell
ye
bethink
ye
in
the
bowels
of
christ
that
ye
may
be
mistaken
one
of
the
secondary
results
of
the
council
was
the
excommunication
of
dollinger
and
a
few
more
of
the
most
uncompromising
of
the
inopportunists
among
these
however
lord
acton
was
not
included
nobody
ever
discovered
why
was
it
because
he
was
too
important
for
the
holy
see
to
care
to
interfere
with
him
or
was
it
because
he
was
not
important
enough
another
ulterior
consequence
was
the
appearance
of
a
pamphlet
by
gladstone
entitled
in
which
the
awful
implications
involved
in
the
declaration
of
infallibility
were
laid
before
the
british
public
how
was
it
possible
gladstone
asked
with
all
the
fulminating
accompaniments
of
his
most
agitated
rhetoric
to
depend
henceforward
upon
the
civil
allegiance
of
roman
catholics
to
this
question
the
words
of
cardinal
antonelli
to
the
austrian
ambassador
might
have
seemed
a
sufficient
reply
is
a
great
difference
said
his
eminence
between
theory
and
practice
no
one
will
ever
prevent
the
church
from
proclaiming
the
great
principles
upon
which
its
divine
fabric
is
based
but
as
regards
the
application
of
those
sacred
laws
the
church
imitating
the
example
of
its
divine
founder
is
inclined
to
take
into
consideration
the
natural
weaknesses
of
mankind
and
in
any
case
it
was
hard
to
see
how
the
system
of
faith
which
had
enabled
pope
gregory
xiii
to
effect
by
the
hands
of
english
catholics
a
whole
series
of
attempts
to
murder
queen
elizabeth
can
have
been
rendered
a
much
more
dangerous
engine
of
disloyalty
by
the
definition
of
but
such
considerations
failed
to
reassure
gladstone
the
british
public
was
of
a
like
mind
and
copies
of
the
pamphlet
were
sold
within
two
months
various
replies
appeared
and
manning
was
not
behindhand
his
share
in
the
controversy
led
to
a
curious
personal
encounter
his
conversion
had
come
as
a
great
shock
to
gladstone
manning
had
breathed
no
word
of
its
approach
to
his
old
and
intimate
friend
and
when
the
news
reached
him
it
seemed
almost
an
act
of
personal
injury
felt
gladstone
said
if
manning
had
murdered
my
mother
by
mistake
for
twelve
years
the
two
men
did
not
meet
after
which
they
occasionally
saw
each
other
and
renewed
their
correspondence
this
was
the
condition
of
affairs
when
gladstone
published
his
pamphlet
as
soon
as
it
appeared
manning
wrote
a
letter
to
the
new
york
herald
contradicting
its
conclusions
and
declaring
that
its
publication
was
first
event
that
has
overcast
a
friendship
of
years
gladstone
replied
to
this
letter
in
a
second
pamphlet
at
the
close
of
his
theological
arguments
he
added
the
following
passage
feel
it
necessary
in
concluding
this
answer
to
state
that
archbishop
manning
has
fallen
into
most
serious
inaccuracy
in
his
letter
of
november
wherein
he
describes
expostulation
as
the
first
event
which
has
overcast
a
friendship
of
years
i
allude
to
the
subject
with
regret
and
without
entering
into
details
manning
replied
in
a
private
letter
dear
gladstone
he
wrote
say
that
i
am
in
error
in
stating
that
your
former
pamphlet
is
the
first
act
which
has
overcast
our
friendship
you
refer
to
my
act
in
in
submitting
to
the
catholic
church
by
which
we
were
separated
for
some
twelve
years
i
can
understand
it
you
refer
to
any
other
act
either
on
your
part
or
mine
i
am
not
conscious
of
it
and
would
desire
to
know
what
it
may
be
act
in
may
have
overcast
your
friendship
for
me
it
did
not
overcast
my
friendship
for
you
as
i
think
the
last
years
have
shown
will
not
i
hope
think
me
in
asking
for
this
explanation
believe
me
yours
affectionately
dear
archbishop
manning
gladstone
answered
did
i
confess
seem
to
me
an
astonishing
error
to
state
in
public
that
a
friendship
had
not
been
overcast
for
years
until
now
which
your
letter
declares
has
been
suspended
as
to
all
action
for
twelve
wonder
too
at
your
forgetting
that
during
the
years
i
had
been
charged
by
you
with
doing
the
work
of
the
antichrist
in
regard
to
the
temporal
power
of
the
pope
differences
my
dear
archbishop
are
indeed
profound
we
refer
them
i
suppose
in
humble
silence
to
a
higher
power
you
assured
me
once
of
your
prayers
at
all
and
at
the
most
solemn
time
i
received
that
assurance
with
gratitude
and
still
cherish
it
as
and
when
they
move
upwards
there
is
a
for
those
whom
a
chasm
separates
below
i
remain
always
affectionately
yours
e
gladstone
speaking
of
this
correspondence
in
after
years
cardinal
manning
said
the
way
in
which
gladstone
alluded
to
the
overcasting
of
our
friendship
people
might
have
thought
that
i
had
picked
his
pocket
viii
in
manning
labours
received
their
final
reward
he
was
made
a
cardinal
his
long
and
strange
career
with
its
high
hopes
its
bitter
disappointments
its
struggles
its
renunciations
had
come
at
last
to
fruition
in
a
princedom
of
the
church
in
faith
and
in
perfect
confidence
he
himself
once
wrote
and
god
will
give
us
what
we
ask
you
may
say
but
do
you
mean
that
he
will
give
us
the
very
thing
that
god
has
not
said
god
has
said
that
he
will
give
you
whatsoever
you
ask
but
the
form
in
which
it
will
come
and
the
time
in
which
he
will
give
it
he
keeps
in
his
own
power
sometimes
our
prayers
are
answered
in
the
very
things
which
we
put
from
us
sometimes
it
may
be
a
chastisement
or
a
loss
or
a
visitation
against
which
our
hearts
rise
and
we
seem
to
see
that
god
has
not
only
forgotten
us
but
has
begun
to
deal
with
us
in
severity
those
very
things
are
the
answers
to
our
prayers
he
knows
what
we
desire
and
he
gives
us
the
things
for
which
we
ask
but
in
the
form
which
his
own
divine
wisdom
sees
to
be
best
there
was
one
to
whom
manning
elevation
would
no
doubt
have
given
a
peculiar
satisfaction
his
old
friend
monsignor
talbot
but
this
was
not
to
be
that
industrious
worker
in
the
cause
of
rome
had
been
removed
some
years
previously
to
a
sequestered
home
at
passy
whose
padded
walls
were
impervious
to
the
rumours
of
the
outer
world
pius
ix
had
been
much
afflicted
by
this
unfortunate
event
he
had
not
been
able
to
resign
himself
to
the
loss
of
his
secretary
and
he
had
given
orders
that
monsignor
talbot
apartment
in
the
vatican
should
be
preserved
precisely
as
he
had
left
it
in
case
of
his
return
but
monsignor
talbot
never
returned
manning
feelings
upon
the
subject
appear
to
have
been
less
tender
than
the
pope
in
all
his
letters
in
all
his
papers
in
all
his
biographical
memoranda
not
a
word
of
allusion
is
to
be
found
to
the
misfortune
nor
to
the
death
of
the
most
loyal
of
his
adherents
monsignor
talbot
name
disappears
suddenly
and
for
ever
like
a
stone
cast
into
the
waters
manning
was
now
an
old
man
and
his
outward
form
had
assumed
that
appearance
of
austere
asceticism
which
is
perhaps
the
one
thing
immediately
suggested
by
his
name
to
the
ordinary
englishman
the
spare
and
stately
form
the
head
massive
emaciated
terrible
with
the
great
nose
the
glittering
eyes
and
the
mouth
drawn
back
and
compressed
into
the
grim
rigidities
of
age
and
authority
such
is
the
vision
that
still
lingers
in
the
public
mind
the
vision
which
actual
and
palpable
like
some
embodied
memory
of
the
middle
ages
used
to
pass
and
repass
less
than
a
generation
since
through
the
streets
of
london
for
the
activities
of
this
extraordinary
figure
were
great
and
varied
he
ruled
his
diocese
with
the
despotic
zeal
of
a
born
administrator
he
threw
himself
into
social
work
of
every
kind
he
organised
charities
he
lectured
on
temperance
he
delivered
innumerable
sermons
he
produced
an
unending
series
of
devotional
books
and
he
brooked
no
brother
near
the
throne
newman
languished
in
birmingham
and
even
the
jesuits
trembled
and
obeyed
nor
was
it
only
among
his
own
community
that
his
energy
and
his
experience
found
scope
he
gradually
came
to
play
an
important
part
in
public
affairs
upon
questions
of
labour
poverty
and
education
he
sat
on
royal
commissions
and
corresponded
with
cabinet
ministers
at
last
no
philanthropic
meeting
at
the
guildhall
was
considered
complete
without
the
presence
of
cardinal
manning
a
special
degree
of
precedence
was
accorded
to
him
though
the
rank
of
a
is
officially
unknown
in
england
his
name
appeared
in
public
documents
as
a
token
it
must
be
supposed
of
personal
consideration
above
the
names
of
peers
and
bishops
and
immediately
below
that
of
the
prince
of
wales
in
his
private
life
he
was
secluded
the
ambiguities
of
his
social
position
and
his
desire
to
maintain
intact
the
peculiar
eminence
of
his
office
combined
to
hold
him
aloof
from
the
ordinary
gatherings
of
society
though
on
the
rare
occasions
of
his
appearance
among
fashionable
and
exalted
persons
he
carried
all
before
him
his
favourite
haunt
was
the
athenaeum
club
where
he
sat
scanning
the
newspapers
or
conversing
with
the
old
friends
of
former
days
he
was
a
member
too
of
that
distinguished
body
the
metaphysical
society
which
met
once
a
month
during
the
palmy
years
of
the
seventies
to
discuss
in
strict
privacy
the
fundamental
problems
of
the
destiny
of
man
after
a
comfortable
dinner
at
the
grosvenor
hotel
the
society
which
included
professor
huxley
and
professor
tyndall
john
morley
and
sir
james
stephen
the
duke
of
argyll
lord
tennyson
and
dean
church
would
gather
around
to
hear
and
discuss
a
paper
read
by
one
of
the
members
upon
such
questions
as
is
death
god
unknowable
or
nature
of
the
moral
principle
sometimes
however
the
speculations
of
the
society
ranged
in
other
directions
think
the
paper
that
interested
me
most
of
all
that
were
ever
read
at
our
meetings
says
sir
mountstuart
elphinstone
one
on
wherein
consists
the
special
beauty
of
imperfection
and
decay
in
which
were
propounded
the
questions
are
not
ruins
recognised
and
felt
to
be
more
beautiful
than
perfect
structures
why
are
they
so
ought
they
to
be
so
however
the
answers
given
to
these
questions
by
the
metaphysical
society
have
not
been
recorded
for
the
instruction
of
mankind
manning
read
several
papers
and
professor
huxley
and
john
morley
listened
with
attention
while
he
expressed
his
views
upon
soul
before
and
after
death
or
explained
why
it
is
legitimate
authority
is
an
evidence
of
truth
yet
somehow
or
other
his
eminence
never
felt
quite
at
ease
in
these
assemblies
he
was
more
at
home
with
audiences
of
a
different
kind
and
we
must
look
in
other
directions
for
the
free
and
full
manifestation
of
his
speculative
gifts
in
a
series
of
lectures
for
instance
delivered
in
it
was
the
first
year
of
the
unification
of
italy
upon
present
crisis
of
the
holy
see
tested
by
prophecy
we
catch
some
glimpses
of
the
kind
of
problems
which
were
truly
congenial
to
his
mind
the
following
pages
he
said
have
endeavoured
but
for
so
great
a
subject
most
insufficiently
to
show
that
what
is
passing
in
our
times
is
the
prelude
of
the
antichristian
period
of
the
final
dethronement
of
christendom
and
of
the
restoration
of
society
without
god
in
the
world
intention
is
he
continued
examine
the
present
relation
of
the
church
to
the
civil
powers
of
the
world
by
the
light
of
a
prophecy
recorded
by
st
paul
this
prophecy
thess
ii
to
is
concerned
with
the
coming
of
the
antichrist
and
the
greater
part
of
the
lectures
is
devoted
to
a
minute
examination
of
this
subject
there
is
no
passage
in
scripture
manning
pointed
out
relating
to
the
coming
of
christ
more
explicit
and
express
than
those
foretelling
antichrist
it
therefore
behoved
the
faithful
to
consider
the
matter
more
fully
than
they
are
wont
to
do
in
the
first
place
antichrist
is
a
person
deny
the
personality
of
antichrist
is
to
deny
the
plain
testimony
of
holy
scripture
and
we
must
remember
that
is
a
law
of
holy
scripture
that
when
persons
are
prophesied
of
persons
appear
again
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
antichrist
when
he
did
appear
would
turn
out
to
be
a
jew
was
the
opinion
of
irenaeus
jerome
and
of
the
author
of
the
work
de
consummatione
mundi
ascribed
to
hippolytus
and
of
a
writer
of
a
commentary
on
the
epistle
to
the
thessalonians
ascribed
to
ambrose
of
many
others
who
said
that
he
will
be
of
the
tribe
of
dan
as
for
instance
gregory
the
great
theodoret
aretas
of
caesarea
and
many
more
such
also
is
the
opinion
of
bellarmine
who
calls
it
certain
lessius
affirms
that
the
fathers
with
unanimous
consent
teach
as
undoubted
that
antichrist
will
be
a
jew
ribera
repeats
the
same
opinion
and
adds
that
aretas
bede
haymo
anselm
and
rupert
affirm
that
for
this
reason
the
tribe
of
dan
is
not
numbered
among
those
who
are
sealed
in
the
apocalypse
now
i
think
no
one
can
consider
the
dispersion
and
providential
preservation
of
the
jews
among
all
the
nations
of
the
world
and
the
indestructible
vitality
of
their
race
without
believing
that
they
are
reserved
for
some
future
action
of
his
judgment
and
grace
and
this
is
foretold
again
and
again
in
the
new
testament
lord
continued
manning
widening
the
sweep
of
his
speculations
said
of
these
latter
times
there
shall
arise
false
christs
and
false
prophets
insomuch
as
to
deceive
even
the
elect
that
is
they
shall
not
be
deceived
but
those
who
have
lost
faith
in
the
incarnation
such
as
humanitarians
rationalists
and
pantheists
may
well
be
deceived
by
any
person
of
great
political
power
and
success
who
should
restore
the
jews
to
their
own
land
and
people
jerusalem
once
more
with
the
sons
of
the
patriarchs
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
political
aspect
of
the
world
which
renders
such
a
combination
impossible
indeed
the
state
of
syria
and
the
tide
of
european
diplomacy
which
continually
moving
eastward
render
such
an
event
within
a
reasonable
probability
then
manning
threw
out
a
bold
suggestion
successful
medium
he
said
well
pass
himself
off
by
his
preternatural
endowments
as
the
promised
messiahs
manning
went
on
to
discuss
the
course
of
events
which
would
lead
to
the
final
catastrophe
but
this
subject
he
confessed
with
agencies
so
transcendent
and
mysterious
that
all
i
shall
venture
to
do
will
be
to
sketch
in
outline
what
the
broad
and
luminous
prophecies
especially
of
the
book
of
daniel
and
the
apocalypse
set
forth
without
attempting
to
enter
into
minute
details
which
can
only
be
interpreted
by
the
event
while
applauding
his
modesty
we
need
follow
manning
no
further
in
his
commentary
upon
those
broad
and
luminous
works
except
to
observe
that
apostasy
of
the
city
of
rome
from
the
vicar
of
christ
and
its
destruction
by
the
antichrist
was
in
his
opinion
certain
nor
was
he
without
authority
for
this
belief
for
it
was
held
by
who
writes
expressly
on
the
subject
and
who
besides
as
the
opinion
of
ribera
gaspar
melus
viegas
suarez
bellarmine
and
bosius
that
rome
shall
apostatise
from
the
faith
ix
the
death
of
pius
ix
brought
to
manning
a
last
flattering
testimony
of
the
confidence
with
which
he
was
regarded
at
the
court
of
rome
in
one
of
the
private
consultations
preceding
the
conclave
a
cardinal
suggested
that
manning
should
succeed
to
the
papacy
he
replied
that
he
was
unfit
for
the
position
because
it
was
essential
for
the
interests
of
the
holy
see
that
the
next
pope
should
be
an
italian
the
suggestion
was
pressed
but
manning
held
firm
thus
it
happened
that
the
triple
tiara
seemed
to
come
for
a
moment
within
the
grasp
of
the
late
archdeacon
of
chichester
and
the
cautious
hand
refrained
leo
xiii
was
elected
and
there
was
a
great
change
in
the
policy
of
the
vatican
liberalism
became
the
order
of
the
day
and
now
at
last
the
opportunity
seemed
ripe
for
an
act
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
english
catholics
had
long
been
due
the
bestowal
of
some
mark
of
recognition
from
the
holy
see
upon
the
labours
and
the
sanctity
of
father
newman
it
was
felt
that
a
cardinal
hat
was
the
one
fitting
reward
for
such
a
life
and
accordingly
the
duke
of
norfolk
representing
the
catholic
laity
of
england
visited
manning
and
suggested
that
he
should
forward
the
proposal
to
the
vatican
manning
agreed
and
then
there
followed
a
curious
series
of
incidents
the
last
encounter
in
the
jarring
lives
of
those
two
men
a
letter
was
drawn
up
by
manning
for
the
eye
of
the
pope
embodying
the
duke
of
proposal
but
there
was
an
unaccountable
delay
in
the
transmission
of
this
letter
months
passed
and
it
had
not
reached
the
holy
father
the
whole
matter
would
perhaps
have
dropped
out
of
sight
and
been
forgotten
in
a
way
which
had
become
customary
when
honours
for
newman
were
concerned
had
not
the
duke
of
norfolk
himself
when
he
was
next
in
rome
ventured
to
recommend
to
leo
xiii
that
newman
should
be
made
a
cardinal
his
holiness
welcomed
the
proposal
but
he
said
he
could
do
nothing
until
he
knew
the
views
of
cardinal
manning
thereupon
the
duke
of
norfolk
wrote
to
manning
explaining
what
had
occurred
shortly
afterwards
manning
letter
of
recommendation
after
a
delay
of
six
months
reached
the
pope
and
the
offer
of
a
cardinalate
was
immediately
dispatched
to
newman
but
the
affair
was
not
yet
over
the
offer
had
been
made
would
it
be
accepted
there
was
one
difficulty
in
the
way
newman
was
now
an
infirm
old
man
of
and
it
is
a
rule
that
all
cardinals
who
are
not
also
diocesan
bishops
or
archbishops
reside
as
a
matter
of
course
at
rome
the
change
would
have
been
impossible
for
one
of
his
years
for
one
too
whose
whole
life
was
now
bound
up
with
the
oratory
at
birmingham
but
of
course
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
his
holiness
from
making
an
exception
in
newman
case
and
allowing
him
to
end
his
days
in
england
yet
how
was
newman
himself
to
suggest
this
the
offer
of
the
hat
had
come
to
him
as
an
almost
miraculous
token
of
renewed
confidence
of
ultimate
reconciliation
the
old
long
bitter
estrangement
was
ended
at
last
cloud
is
lifted
from
me
for
ever
he
exclaimed
when
the
news
reached
him
it
would
be
melancholy
indeed
if
the
cup
were
now
to
be
once
more
dashed
from
his
lips
and
he
was
obliged
to
refuse
the
signal
honour
in
his
perplexity
he
went
to
the
bishop
of
birmingham
and
explained
the
whole
situation
the
bishop
assured
him
that
all
would
be
well
that
he
himself
would
communicate
with
the
authorities
and
put
the
facts
of
the
case
before
them
accordingly
while
newman
wrote
formally
refusing
the
hat
on
the
ground
of
his
unwillingness
to
leave
the
oratory
the
bishop
wrote
two
letters
to
manning
one
official
and
one
private
in
which
the
following
passages
occurred
newman
has
far
too
humble
and
delicate
a
mind
to
dream
of
thinking
or
saying
anything
which
would
look
like
hinting
at
any
kind
of
terms
with
the
sovereign
pontiff
i
think
however
that
i
ought
to
express
my
own
sense
of
what
newman
dispositions
are
and
that
it
will
be
expected
of
me
i
am
thoroughly
confident
that
nothing
stands
in
the
way
of
his
most
grateful
acceptance
except
what
he
tells
me
greatly
distresses
him
namely
the
having
to
leave
the
oratory
at
a
critical
period
of
its
existence
and
the
impossibility
of
his
beginning
a
new
life
at
his
advanced
age
and
in
his
private
letter
the
bishop
said
newman
is
very
much
aged
and
softened
with
age
and
the
trials
he
has
had
especially
the
loss
of
his
two
brethren
john
and
caswall
he
can
never
refer
to
these
losses
without
weeping
and
becoming
speechless
for
a
time
he
is
very
much
affected
by
the
pope
kindness
and
would
i
know
like
to
receive
the
great
honour
offered
him
but
feels
the
whole
difficulty
at
his
age
of
changing
his
life
or
having
to
leave
the
oratory
which
i
am
sure
he
could
not
do
if
the
holy
father
thinks
well
to
confer
on
him
the
dignity
leaving
him
where
he
is
i
know
how
immensely
he
would
be
gratified
and
you
will
know
how
generally
the
conferring
on
him
the
cardinalate
will
be
applauded
these
two
letters
together
with
newman
refusal
reached
manning
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
starting
for
rome
after
he
had
left
england
the
following
statement
appeared
in
the
times
leo
xiii
has
intimated
his
desire
to
raise
newman
to
the
rank
of
cardinal
but
with
expressions
of
deep
respect
for
the
holy
see
newman
has
excused
himself
from
accepting
the
purple
when
newman
eyes
fell
upon
the
announcement
he
realised
at
once
that
a
secret
and
powerful
force
was
working
against
him
he
trembled
as
he
had
so
often
trembled
before
and
certainly
the
danger
was
not
imaginary
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
how
could
such
a
paragraph
have
been
inserted
without
his
authority
and
consequently
did
it
not
convey
to
the
world
not
only
an
absolute
refusal
which
he
had
never
intended
but
a
wish
on
his
part
to
emphasise
publicly
his
rejection
of
the
proffered
honour
did
it
not
imply
that
he
had
lightly
declined
a
proposal
for
which
in
reality
he
was
deeply
thankful
and
when
the
fatal
paragraph
was
read
in
rome
might
it
not
actually
lead
to
the
offer
of
the
cardinalate
being
finally
withheld
in
great
agitation
newman
appealed
to
the
duke
of
norfolk
to
the
statement
he
wrote
my
refusing
a
cardinal
hat
which
is
in
the
papers
you
must
not
believe
it
for
this
reason
course
it
implies
that
an
offer
has
been
made
me
and
i
have
sent
an
answer
to
it
now
i
have
ever
understood
that
it
is
a
point
of
propriety
and
honour
to
consider
such
communications
sacred
this
statement
therefore
can
not
come
from
me
nor
could
it
come
from
rome
for
it
was
made
public
before
my
answer
got
to
rome
could
only
come
then
from
someone
who
not
only
read
my
letter
but
instead
of
leaving
to
the
pope
to
interpret
it
took
upon
himself
to
put
an
interpretation
upon
it
and
published
that
interpretation
to
the
world
private
letter
addressed
to
roman
authorities
is
interpreted
on
its
way
and
published
in
the
english
papers
how
is
it
possible
that
anyone
can
have
done
this
the
crushing
indictment
pointed
straight
at
manning
and
it
was
true
manning
had
done
the
impossible
deed
knowing
what
he
did
with
the
bishop
of
birmingham
two
letters
in
his
pocket
he
had
put
it
about
that
newman
had
refused
the
hat
but
a
change
had
come
over
the
spirit
of
the
holy
see
things
were
not
as
they
had
once
been
monsignor
talbot
was
at
passy
and
pio
nono
was
where
the
duke
of
norfolk
intervened
once
again
manning
was
profuse
in
his
apologies
for
having
misunderstood
newman
intentions
and
hurried
to
the
pope
to
rectify
the
error
without
hesitation
the
sovereign
pontiff
relaxed
the
rule
of
roman
residence
and
newman
became
a
cardinal
he
lived
to
enjoy
his
glory
for
more
than
ten
years
since
he
rarely
left
the
oratory
and
since
manning
never
visited
birmingham
the
two
cardinals
met
only
once
or
twice
after
one
of
these
occasions
on
returning
to
the
oratory
cardinal
newman
said
do
you
think
cardinal
manning
did
to
me
he
kissed
me
on
newman
death
manning
delivered
a
funeral
oration
which
opened
thus
have
lost
our
greatest
witness
for
the
faith
and
we
are
all
poorer
and
lower
by
the
loss
these
tidings
came
to
me
my
first
thought
was
this
in
what
way
can
i
once
more
show
my
love
and
veneration
for
my
brother
and
friend
of
more
than
sixty
years
in
private
however
the
surviving
cardinal
tone
was
apt
to
be
more
direct
newman
he
once
exclaimed
in
a
moment
of
genial
expansion
newman
he
was
a
great
hater
x
in
that
gaunt
and
gloomy
building
more
like
a
barracks
than
an
episcopal
palace
archbishop
house
westminster
manning
existence
stretched
itself
out
into
an
extreme
old
age
as
his
years
increased
his
activities
if
that
were
possible
increased
too
meetings
missions
lectures
sermons
articles
interviews
letters
such
things
came
upon
him
in
redoubled
multitudes
and
were
dispatched
with
an
unrelenting
zeal
but
this
was
not
all
with
age
he
seemed
to
acquire
what
was
almost
a
new
fervour
an
unaccustomed
unexpected
freeing
of
the
spirit
filling
him
with
preoccupations
which
he
had
hardly
felt
before
say
i
am
ambitious
he
noted
in
his
diary
do
i
rest
in
my
ambition
no
assuredly
he
did
not
rest
but
he
worked
now
with
no
arriere
pensee
for
the
greater
glory
of
god
a
kind
of
frenzy
fell
upon
him
poverty
drunkenness
vice
all
the
horrors
and
terrors
of
our
civilisation
seized
upon
his
mind
and
urged
him
forward
to
new
fields
of
action
and
new
fields
of
thought
the
temper
of
his
soul
assumed
almost
a
revolutionary
cast
am
a
mosaic
radical
he
exclaimed
and
indeed
in
the
exaltation
of
his
energies
the
incoherence
of
his
conceptions
the
democratic
urgency
of
his
desires
combined
with
his
aspect
and
his
venerable
age
it
was
easy
enough
to
trace
the
mingled
qualities
of
the
patriarch
the
prophet
and
the
demagogue
as
in
his
soiled
and
shabby
garments
the
old
man
harangued
the
crowds
of
bermondsey
or
peckham
upon
the
virtues
of
temperance
assuring
them
with
all
the
passion
of
conviction
as
a
final
argument
that
the
majority
of
the
apostles
were
total
abstainers
this
prince
of
the
church
might
have
passed
as
a
leader
of
the
salvation
army
his
popularity
was
immense
reaching
its
height
during
the
great
dock
strikes
of
when
after
the
victory
of
the
men
was
assured
manning
was
able
by
his
persuasive
eloquence
and
the
weight
of
his
character
to
prevent
its
being
carried
to
excess
after
other
conciliators
among
whom
was
the
bishop
of
london
had
given
up
the
task
in
disgust
the
octogenarian
cardinal
worked
on
with
indefatigable
resolution
at
last
late
at
night
in
the
schools
in
kirby
street
bermondsey
he
rose
to
address
the
strikers
an
enthusiastic
has
described
the
scene
tears
glistened
in
the
eyes
of
his
rough
and
hearers
as
the
cardinal
raised
his
hand
and
solemnly
urged
them
not
to
prolong
one
moment
more
than
they
could
help
the
perilous
uncertainty
and
the
sufferings
of
their
wives
and
children
just
above
his
uplifted
hand
was
a
figure
of
the
madonna
and
child
and
some
among
the
men
tell
how
a
sudden
light
seemed
to
swim
around
it
as
the
speaker
pleaded
for
the
women
and
children
when
he
sat
down
all
in
the
room
knew
that
he
had
won
the
day
and
that
so
far
as
the
strike
committee
was
concerned
the
matter
was
at
an
end
in
those
days
there
were
strange
visitors
at
the
archbishop
house
careful
priests
and
conscientious
secretaries
wondered
what
the
world
was
coming
to
when
they
saw
labour
leaders
like
john
burns
and
ben
tillett
and
like
henry
george
being
ushered
into
the
presence
of
his
eminence
even
the
notorious
stead
appeared
and
his
scandalous
paper
with
its
unspeakable
revelations
lay
upon
the
cardinal
table
this
proved
too
much
for
one
of
the
faithful
tonsured
dependents
of
the
place
and
he
ventured
to
expostulate
with
his
master
but
he
never
did
so
again
when
the
guests
were
gone
and
the
great
room
was
empty
the
old
man
would
draw
himself
nearer
to
the
enormous
fire
and
review
once
more
for
the
thousandth
time
the
long
adventure
of
his
life
he
would
bring
out
his
diaries
and
his
memoranda
he
would
rearrange
his
notes
he
would
turn
over
again
the
yellow
leaves
of
faded
correspondences
seizing
his
pen
he
would
pour
out
his
comments
and
reflections
and
fill
with
an
extraordinary

past
he
would
snip
with
scissors
the
pages
of
ancient
journals
and
with
delicate
ecclesiastical
fingers
drop
unknown
mysteries
into
the
flames
sometimes
he
would
turn
to
the
four
red
folio
scrapbooks
with
their
collection
of
newspaper
cuttings
concerning
himself
over
a
period
of
thirty
years
then
the
pale
cheeks
would
flush
and
the
lips
would
grow
even
more
menacing
than
before
mulish
malice
he
would
note
lying
conscious
deliberate
and
designed
lying
personal
animosity
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
and
then
he
would
suddenly
begin
to
doubt
after
all
where
was
he
what
had
he
accomplished
had
any
of
it
been
worthwhile
had
he
not
been
out
of
the
world
all
his
life
out
of
the
world
life
and
letters
and
hayward
letters
he
notes
so
full
of
politics
literature
action
events
collision
of
mind
with
mind
and
that
with
such
a
multitude
of
men
in
every
state
of
life
that
when
i
look
back
it
seems
as
if
i
had
been
simply
useless
and
again
complete
isolation
and
exclusion
from
the
official
life
of
england
in
which
i
have
lived
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
had
done
nothing
he
struggled
to
console
himself
with
the
reflexion
that
all
this
was
only
natural
order
the
natural
order
is
moved
by
the
supernatural
order
then
i
may
not
have
done
nothing
fifty
years
of
witness
for
god
and
his
truth
i
hope
has
not
been
in
vain
but
the
same
thoughts
recurred
reading
macaulay
life
i
had
a
haunting
feeling
that
his
had
been
a
life
of
public
utility
and
mine
a
vita
umbratilis
a
life
in
the
shade
ah
it
was
god
will
has
been
a
life
of
fifty
years
out
of
the
world
as
gladstone
has
been
in
it
the
work
of
his
life
in
this
world
is
manifest
i
hope
mine
may
be
in
the
next
i
suppose
our
lord
called
me
out
of
the
world
because
he
saw
that
i
should
lose
my
soul
in
it
clearly
that
was
the
explanation
and
yet
he
remained
sufficiently
in
the
world
to
discharge
with
absolute
efficiency
the
complex
government
of
his
diocese
almost
up
to
the
last
moment
of
his
existence
though
his
bodily
strength
gradually
ebbed
the
vigour
of
his
mind
was
undismayed
at
last
supported
by
cushions
he
continued
by
means
of
a
dictated
correspondence
to
exert
his
accustomed
rule
only
occasionally
would
he
lay
aside
his
work
to
plunge
into
the
yet
more
necessary
duties
of
devotion
never
again
would
he
preach
never
again
would
he
put
into
practice
those
three
salutary
rules
of
his
in
choosing
a
subject
for
a
sermon
asking
god
to
guide
the
choice
applying
the
matter
to
myself
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
my
head
and
heart
and
lips
in
honour
of
the
sacred
mouth
but
he
could
still
pray
he
could
turn
especially
to
the
holy
ghost
very
simple
but
devout
person
he
wrote
in
one
of
his
latest
memoranda
me
why
in
my
first
volume
of
sermons
i
said
so
little
about
the
holy
ghost
i
was
not
aware
of
it
but
i
found
it
to
be
true
i
at
once
resolved
that
i
would
make
a
reparation
every
day
of
my
life
to
the
holy
ghost
this
i
have
never
failed
to
do
to
this
day
to
this
i
owe
the
light
and
faith
which
brought
me
into
the
truefold
i
bought
all
the
books
i
could
about
the
holy
ghost
i
worked
out
the
truths
about
his
personality
his
presence
and
his
office
this
made
me
understand
the
last
paragraph
in
the
apostles
creed
and
made
me
a
catholic
christian
so
though
death
came
slowly
struggling
step
by
step
with
that
bold
and
tenacious
spirit
when
he
did
come
at
last
the
cardinal
was
ready
robed
in
his
archiepiscopal
vestments
his
rochet
his
girdle
and
his
mozzetta
with
the
scarlet
biretta
on
his
head
and
the
pectoral
cross
upon
his
breast
he
made
his
solemn
profession
of
faith
in
the
holy
roman
church
a
crowd
of
lesser
dignitaries
each
in
the
garments
of
his
office
attended
the
ceremonial
the
bishop
of
salford
held
up
the
pontificale
and
the
bishop
of
amycla
bore
the
wax
taper
the
provost
of
westminster
on
his
knees
read
aloud
the
profession
of
faith
surrounded
by
the
canons
of
the
diocese
towards
those
who
gathered
about
him
the
dying
man
was
still
able
to
show
some
signs
of
recognition
and
even
perhaps
of
affection
yet
it
seemed
that
his
chief
preoccupation
up
to
the
very
end
was
with
his
obedience
to
the
rules
prescribed
by
the
divine
authority
am
glad
to
have
been
able
to
do
everything
in
due
order
were
among
his
last
words
fort

manning
died
on
january
in
the
year
of
his
age
a
few
days
later
gladstone
took
occasion
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
to
refer
to
his
relations
with
the
late
cardinal
manning
conversion
was
he
said
the
severest
blow
that
ever
befell
me
in
a
late
letter
the
cardinal
termed
it
a
quarrel
but
in
my
reply
i
told
him
it
was
not
a
quarrel
but
a
death
and
that
was
the
truth
since
then
there
have
been
vicissitudes
but
i
am
quite
certain
that
to
the
last
his
personal
feelings
never
changed
and
i
believe
also
that
he
kept
a
promise
made
in
to
remember
me
before
god
at
the
most
solemn
moments
a
promise
which
i
greatly
valued
the
whole
subject
is
to
me
at
once
of
extreme
interest
and
of
considerable
restraint
reluctance
to
die
concluded
gladstone
be
explained
by
an
intense
anxiety
to
complete
unfulfilled
service
the
funeral
was
the
occasion
of
a
popular
demonstration
such
as
has
rarely
been
witnessed
in
the
streets
of
london
the
route
of
the
procession
was
lined
by
vast
crowds
of
working
people
whose
imaginations
in
some
instinctive
manner
had
been
touched
many
who
had
hardly
seen
him
declared
that
in
cardinal
manning
they
had
lost
their
best
friend
was
it
the
magnetic
vigour
of
the
dead
man
spirit
that
moved
them
or
was
it
his
valiant
disregard
of
common
custom
and
those
conventional
reserves
and
poor
punctilios
which
are
wont
to
hem
about
the
great
or
was
it
something
untameable
in
his
glances
and
in
his
gestures
or
was
it
perhaps
the
mysterious
glamour
lingering
about
him
of
the
antique
organisation
of
rome
for
whatever
cause
the
mind
of
the
people
had
been
impressed
and
yet
after
all
the
impression
was
more
acute
than
lasting
the
cardinal
memory
is
a
dim
thing
today
and
he
who
descends
into
the
crypt
of
that
cathedral
which
manning
never
lived
to
see
will
observe
in
the
quiet
niche
with
the
sepulchral
monument
that
the
dust
lies
thick
on
the
strange
the
incongruous
the
almost
impossible
object
which
with
its
elaborations
of
dependent
tassels
hangs
down
from
the
dim
vault
like
some
forlorn
and
forgotten
trophy

every
one
knows
the
popular
conception
of
florence
nightingale
the
saintly
woman
the
delicate
maiden
of
high
degree
who
threw
aside
the
pleasures
of
a
life
of
ease
to
succour
the
afflicted
the
lady
with
the
lamp
gliding
through
the
horrors
of
the
hospital
at
scutari
and
consecrating
with
the
radiance
of
her
goodness
the
dying
soldier
couch
the
vision
is
familiar
to
all
but
the
truth
was
different
the
miss
nightingale
of
fact
was
not
as
facile
as
fancy
painted
her
she
worked
in
another
fashion
and
towards
another
end
she
moved
under
the
stress
of
an
impetus
which
finds
no
place
in
the
popular
imagination
a
demon
possessed
her
now
demons
whatever
else
they
may
be
are
full
of
interest
and
so
it
happens
that
in
the
real
miss
nightingale
there
was
more
that
was
interesting
than
in
the
legendary
one
there
was
also
less
that
was
agreeable
her
family
was
extremely
and
connected
by
marriage
with
a
spreading
circle
of
other
families
there
was
a
large
country
house
in
derbyshire
there
was
another
in
the
new
forest
there
were
mayfair
rooms
for
the
london
season
and
all
its
finest
parties
there
were
tours
on
the
continent
with
even
more
than
the
usual
number
of
italian
operas
and
of
glimpses
at
the
celebrities
of
paris
brought
up
among
such
advantages
it
was
only
natural
to
suppose
that
florence
would
show
a
proper
appreciation
of
them
by
doing
her
duty
in
that
state
of
life
unto
which
it
had
pleased
god
to
call
her
in
other
words
by
marrying
after
a
fitting
number
of
dances
and
an
eligible
gentleman
and
living
happily
ever
afterwards
her
sister
her
cousins
all
the
young
ladies
of
her
acquaintance
were
either
getting
ready
to
do
this
or
had
already
done
it
it
was
inconceivable
that
florence
should
dream
of
anything
else
yet
dream
she
did
ah
to
do
her
duty
in
that
state
of
life
unto
which
it
had
pleased
god
to
call
her
assuredly
she
would
not
be
behindhand
in
doing
her
duty
but
unto
what
state
of
life
had
it
pleased
god
to
call
her
that
was
the
question
god
calls
are
many
and
they
are
strange
unto
what
state
of
life
had
it
pleased
him
to
call
charlotte
corday
or
elizabeth
of
hungary
what
was
that
secret
voice
in
her
ear
if
it
was
not
a
call
why
had
she
felt
from
her
earliest
years
those
mysterious
promptings
towards
she
hardly
knew
what
but
certainly
towards
something
very
different
from
anything
around
her
why
as
a
child
in
the
nursery
when
her
sister
had
shown
a
healthy
pleasure
in
tearing
her
dolls
to
pieces
had
she
shown
an
almost
morbid
one
in
sewing
them
up
again
why
was
she
driven
now
to
minister
to
the
poor
in
their
cottages
to
watch
by
to
put
her
dog
wounded
paw
into
elaborate
splints
as
if
it
was
a
human
being
why
was
her
head
filled
with
queer
imaginations
of
the
country
house
at
embley
turned
by
some
enchantment
into
a
hospital
with
herself
as
matron
moving
about
among
the
beds
why
was
even
her
vision
of
heaven
itself
filled
with
suffering
patients
to
whom
she
was
being
useful
so
she
dreamed
and
wondered
and
taking
out
her
diary
she
poured
into
it
the
agitations
of
her
soul
and
then
the
bell
rang
and
it
was
time
to
go
and
dress
for
dinner
as
the
years
passed
a
restlessness
began
to
grow
upon
her
she
was
unhappy
and
at
last
she
knew
it
nightingale
too
began
to
notice
that
there
was
something
wrong
it
was
very
odd
what
could
be
the
matter
with
dear
flo
nightingale
suggested
that
a
husband
might
be
advisable
but
the
curious
thing
was
that
she
seemed
to
take
no
interest
in
husbands
and
with
her
attractions
and
her
accomplishments
too
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
to
prevent
her
making
a
really
brilliant
match
but
no
she
would
think
of
nothing
but
how
to
satisfy
that
singular
craving
of
hers
to
be
doing
something
as
if
there
was
not
plenty
to
do
in
any
case
in
the
ordinary
way
at
home
there
was
the
china
to
look
after
and
there
was
her
father
to
be
read
to
after
dinner
nightingale
could
not
understand
it
and
then
one
day
her
perplexity
was
changed
to
consternation
and
alarm
florence
announced
an
extreme
desire
to
go
to
salisbury
hospital
for
several
months
as
a
nurse
and
she
confessed
to
some
visionary
plan
of
eventually
setting
up
in
a
house
of
her
own
in
a
neighbouring
village
and
there
founding
like
a
protestant
sisterhood
without
vows
for
women
of
educated
feelings
the
whole
scheme
was
summarily
brushed
aside
as
preposterous
and
nightingale
after
the
first
shock
of
terror
was
able
to
settle
down
again
more
or
less
comfortably
to
her
embroidery
but
florence
who
was
now
and
felt
that
the
dream
of
her
life
had
been
shattered
came
near
to
desperation
and
indeed
the
difficulties
in
her
path
were
great
for
not
only
was
it
an
almost
unimaginable
thing
in
those
days
for
a
woman
of
means
to
make
her
own
way
in
the
world
and
to
live
in
independence
but
the
particular
profession
for
which
florence
was
clearly
marked
out
both
by
her
instincts
and
her
capacities
was
at
that
time
a
peculiarly
disreputable
one
a
meant
then
a
coarse
old
woman
always
ignorant
usually
dirty
often
brutal
a
gamp
in
sordid
garments
tippling
at
the
brandy
bottle
or
indulging
in
worse
irregularities
the
nurses
in
the
hospitals
were
especially
notorious
for
immoral
conduct
sobriety
was
almost
unknown
among
them
and
they
could
hardly
be
trusted
to
carry
out
the
simplest
medical
duties
certainly
things
have
changed
since
those
days
and
that
they
have
changed
is
due
far
more
than
to
any
other
human
being
to
miss
nightingale
herself
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
her
parents
should
have
shuddered
at
the
notion
of
their
daughter
devoting
her
life
to
such
an
occupation
was
as
if
she
herself
said
afterwards
had
wanted
to
be
a
yet
the
want
absurd
and
impracticable
as
it
was
not
only
remained
fixed
immovably
in
her
heart
but
grew
in
intensity
day
by
day
her
wretchedness
deepened
into
a
morbid
melancholy
everything
about
her
was
vile
and
she
herself
it
was
clear
to
have
deserved
such
misery
was
even
viler
than
her
surroundings
yes
she
had
sinned
before
god
judgment
seat
one
she
declared
so
grieved
the
holy
spirit
of
that
she
was
quite
certain
it
was
in
vain
that
she
prayed
to
be
delivered
from
vanity
and
hypocrisy
and
she
could
not
bear
to
smile
or
to
be
gay
she
hated
god
to
hear
her
laugh
as
if
she
had
not
repented
of
her
sin
a
weaker
spirit
would
have
been
overwhelmed
by
the
load
of
such
distresses
would
have
yielded
or
snapped
but
this
extraordinary
young
woman
held
firm
and
fought
her
way
to
victory
with
an
amazing
persistency
during
the
eight
years
that
followed
her
rebuff
over
salisbury
hospital
she
struggled
and
worked
and
planned
while
superficially
she
was
carrying
on
the
life
of
a
brilliant
girl
in
high
society
while
internally
she
was
a
prey
to
the
tortures
of
regret
and
of
remorse
she
yet
possessed
the
energy
to
collect
the
knowledge
and
to
undergo
the
experience
which
alone
could
enable
her
to
do
what
she
had
determined
she
would
do
in
the
end
in
secret
she
devoured
the
reports
of
medical
commissions
the
pamphlets
of
sanitary
authorities
the
histories
of
hospitals
and
homes
she
spent
the
intervals
of
the
london
season
in
ragged
schools
and
workhouses
when
she
went
abroad
with
her
family
she
used
her
spare
time
so
well
that
there
was
hardly
a
great
hospital
in
europe
with
which
she
was
not
acquainted
hardly
a
great
city
whose
slums
she
had
not
passed
through
she
managed
to
spend
some
days
in
a
convent
school
in
rome
and
some
weeks
as
a
de
in
paris
then
while
her
mother
and
sister
were
taking
the
waters
at
carlsbad
she
succeeded
in
slipping
off
to
a
nursing
institution
at
kaiserswerth
where
she
remained
for
more
than
three
months
this
was
the
critical
event
of
her
life
the
experience
which
she
gained
as
a
nurse
at
kaiserswerth
formed
the
foundation
of
all
her
future
action
and
finally
fixed
her
in
her
career
but
one
other
trial
awaited
her
the
allurements
of
the
world
she
had
brushed
aside
with
disdain
and
loathing
she
had
resisted
the
subtler
temptation
which
in
her
weariness
had
sometimes
come
upon
her
of
devoting
her
baffled
energies
to
art
or
literature
the
last
ordeal
appeared
in
the
shape
of
a
desirable
young
man
hitherto
her
lovers
had
been
nothing
to
her
but
an
added
burden
and
a
mockery
but
now
for
a
moment
she
wavered
a
new
feeling
swept
over
her
a
feeling
which
she
had
never
known
before
which
she
was
never
to
know
again
the
most
powerful
and
the
profoundest
of
all
the
instincts
of
humanity
laid
claim
upon
her
but
it
rose
before
her
that
instinct
arrayed
how
could
it
be
otherwise
in
the
inevitable
habiliments
of
a
victorian
marriage
and
she
had
the
strength
to
stamp
it
underfoot
have
an
intellectual
nature
which
requires
satisfaction
she
noted
that
would
find
it
in
him
i
have
a
passionate
nature
which
requires
satisfaction
and
that
would
find
it
in
him
i
have
a
moral
an
active
nature
which
requires
satisfaction
and
that
would
not
find
it
in
his
life
sometimes
i
think
that
i
will
satisfy
my
passionate
nature
at
all
events
but
no
she
knew
in
her
heart
that
it
could
not
be
be
nailed
to
a
continuation
and
exaggeration
of
my
present
life
to
put
it
out
of
my
power
ever
to
be
able
to
seize
the
chance
of
forming
for
myself
a
true
and
rich
life
that
would
be
a
suicide
she
made
her
choice
and
refused
what
was
at
least
a
certain
happiness
for
a
visionary
good
which
might
never
come
to
her
at
all
and
so
she
returned
to
her
old
life
of
waiting
and
bitterness
thoughts
and
feelings
that
i
have
now
she
wrote
can
remember
since
i
was
six
years
old
a
profession
a
trade
a
necessary
occupation
something
to
fill
and
employ
all
my
faculties
i
have
always
felt
essential
to
me
i
have
always
longed
for
the
first
thought
i
can
remember
and
the
last
was
nursing
work
and
in
the
absence
of
this
education
work
but
more
the
education
of
the
bad
than
of
the
young
everything
has
been
tried
foreign
travel
kind
friends
everything
my
god
what
is
to
become
of
me
a
desirable
young
man
dust
and
ashes
what
was
there
desirable
in
such
a
thing
as
that
my
year
she
noted
in
her
diary
see
nothing
desirable
but
death
three
more
years
passed
and
then
at
last
the
pressure
of
time
told
her
family
seemed
to
realise
that
she
was
old
enough
and
strong
enough
to
have
her
way
and
she
became
the
superintendent
of
a
charitable
nursing
home
in
harley
street
she
had
gained
her
independence
though
it
was
in
a
meagre
sphere
enough
and
her
mother
was
still
not
quite
resigned
surely
florence
might
at
least
spend
the
summer
in
the
country
at
times
indeed
among
her
intimates
nightingale
almost
wept
are
ducks
she
said
with
tears
in
her
eyes
have
hatched
a
wild
swan
but
the
poor
lady
was
wrong
it
was
not
a
swan
that
they
had
hatched
it
was
an
eagle
ii
miss
nightingale
had
been
a
year
in
her
in
harley
street
when
fate
knocked
at
the
door
the
crimean
war
broke
out
the
battle
of
the
alma
was
fought
and
the
terrible
condition
of
our
military
hospitals
at
scutari
began
to
be
known
in
england
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
plans
of
providence
are
a
little
difficult
to
follow
but
on
this
occasion
all
was
plain
there
was
a
perfect
coordination
of
events
for
years
miss
nightingale
had
been
getting
ready
at
last
she
was
prepared
experienced
free
mature
yet
still
young
she
was
desirous
to
serve
accustomed
to
command
at
that
precise
moment
the
desperate
need
of
a
great
nation
came
and
she
was
there
to
satisfy
it
if
the
war
had
fallen
a
few
years
earlier
she
would
have
lacked
the
knowledge
perhaps
even
the
power
for
such
a
work
a
few
years
later
and
she
would
no
doubt
have
been
fixed
in
the
routine
of
some
absorbing
task
and
moreover
she
would
have
been
growing
old
nor
was
it
only
the
coincidence
of
time
that
was
remarkable
it
so
fell
out
that
sidney
herbert
was
at
the
war
office
and
in
the
cabinet
and
sidney
herbert
was
an
intimate
friend
of
miss
nightingale
convinced
from
personal
experience
in
charitable
work
of
her
supreme
capacity
after
such
premises
it
seems
hardly
more
than
a
matter
of
course
that
her
letter
in
which
she
offered
her
services
for
the
east
and
sidney
herbert
letter
in
which
he
asked
for
them
should
actually
have
crossed
in
the
post
thus
it
all
happened
without
a
hitch
the
appointment
was
made
and
even
nightingale
overawed
by
the
magnitude
of
the
venture
could
only
approve
a
pair
of
faithful
friends
offered
themselves
as
personal
attendants
nurses
were
collected
and
within
a
week
of
the
crossing
of
the
letters
miss
nightingale
amid
a
great
burst
of
popular
enthusiasm
left
for
constantinople
among
the
numerous
letters
which
she
received
on
her
departure
was
one
from
manning
who
at
that
time
was
working
in
comparative
obscurity
as
a
catholic
priest
in
bayswater
will
keep
you
he
wrote
my
prayer
for
you
will
be
that
your
one
object
of
worship
pattern
of
imitation
and
source
of
consolation
and
strength
may
be
the
sacred
heart
of
our
divine
lord
to
what
extent
manning
prayer
was
answered
must
remain
a
matter
of
doubt
but
this
much
is
certain
that
if
ever
a
prayer
was
needed
it
was
needed
then
for
florence
nightingale
for
dark
as
had
been
the
picture
of
the
state
of
affairs
at
scutari
revealed
to
the
english
public
in
the
dispatches
of
the
times
correspondent
and
in
a
multitude
of
private
letters
yet
the
reality
turned
out
to
be
darker
still
what
had
occurred
was
in
brief
the
complete
breakdown
of
our
medical
arrangements
at
the
seat
of
war
the
origins
of
this
awful
failure
were
complex
and
manifold
they
stretched
back
through
long
years
of
peace
and
carelessness
in
england
they
could
be
traced
through
endless
ramifications
of
administrative
incapacity
from
the
inherent
faults
of
confused
systems
to
the
petty
bunglings
of
minor
officials
from
the
inevitable
ignorance
of
cabinet
ministers
to
the
fatal
exactitudes
of
narrow
routine
in
the
inquiries
which
followed
it
was
clearly
shown
that
the
evil
was
in
reality
that
worst
of
all
evils
one
which
has
been
caused
by
nothing
in
particular
and
for
which
no
one
in
particular
is
to
blame
the
whole
organisation
of
the
war
machine
was
incompetent
and
out
of
date
the
old
duke
had
sat
for
a
generation
at
the
horse
guards
repressing
innovations
with
an
iron
hand
there
was
an
extraordinary
overlapping
of
authorities
and
an
almost
incredible
shifting
of
responsibilities
to
and
fro
as
for
such
a
notion
as
the
creation
and
the
maintenance
of
a
really
adequate
medical
service
for
the
army
in
that
atmosphere
of
aged
chaos
how
could
it
have
entered
anybody
head
before
the
war
the
easygoing
officials
at
westminster
were
naturally
persuaded
that
all
was
well
or
at
least
as
well
as
could
be
expected
when
someone
for
instance
actually
had
the
temerity
to
suggest
the
formation
of
a
corps
of
army
nurses
he
was
at
once
laughed
out
of
court
when
the
war
had
begun
the
gallant
british
officers
in
control
of
affairs
had
other
things
to
think
about
than
the
petty
details
of
medical
organisation
who
had
bothered
with
such
trifles
in
the
peninsula
and
surely
on
that
occasion
we
had
done
pretty
well
thus
the
most
obvious
precautions
were
neglected
and
the
most
necessary
preparations
were
put
off
from
day
to
day
the
principal
medical
officer
of
the
army
hall
was
summoned
from
india
at
a
moment
notice
and
was
unable
to
visit
england
before
taking
up
his
duties
at
the
front
and
it
was
not
until
after
the
battle
of
the
alma
when
we
had
been
at
war
for
many
months
that
we
acquired
hospital
accommodations
at
scutari
for
more
than
a
thousand
men
errors
follies
and
vices
on
the
part
of
individuals
there
doubtless
were
but
in
the
general
reckoning
they
were
of
small
account
insignificant
symptoms
of
the
deep
disease
of
the
body
politic
to
the
enormous
calamity
of
administrative
collapse
miss
nightingale
arrived
at
scutari
a
suburb
of
constantinople
on
the
asiatic
side
of
the
bosphorus
on
november
it
was
ten
days
after
the
battle
of
balaclava
and
the
day
before
the
battle
of
inkerman
the
organisation
of
the
hospitals
which
had
already
given
way
under
the
stress
of
the
battle
of
the
alma
was
now
to
be
subjected
to
the
further
pressure
which
these
two
desperate
and
bloody
engagements
implied
great
detachments
of
wounded
were
already
beginning
to
pour
in
the
men
after
receiving
such
summary
treatment
as
could
be
given
them
at
the
smaller
hospitals
in
the
crimea
itself
were
forthwith
shipped
in
batches
of
across
the
black
sea
to
scutari
this
voyage
was
in
normal
times
one
of
four
days
and
a
half
but
the
times
were
no
longer
normal
and
now
the
transit
often
lasted
for
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
it
received
not
without
reason
the
name
of
the
passage
between
and
sometimes
on
the
decks
the
wounded
the
sick
and
the
dying
were
crowded
men
who
had
just
undergone
the
amputation
of
limbs
men
in
the
clutches
of
fever
or
of
frostbite
men
in
the
last
stages
of
dysentry
and
cholera
without
beds
sometimes
without
blankets
often
hardly
clothed
the
one
or
two
surgeons
on
board
did
what
they
could
but
medical
stores
were
lacking
and
the
only
form
of
nursing
available
was
that
provided
by
a
handful
of
invalid
soldiers
who
were
usually
themselves
prostrate
by
the
end
of
the
voyage
there
was
no
other
food
beside
the
ordinary
salt
rations
of
ship
diet
and
even
the
water
was
sometimes
so
stored
that
it
was
out
of
reach
of
the
weak
for
many
months
the
average
of
deaths
during
these
voyages
was
in
the
corpses
were
shot
out
into
the
waters
and
who
shall
say
that
they
were
the
most
unfortunate
at
scutari
the
constructed
with
all
the
perverseness
of
oriental
ingenuity
could
only
be
approached
with
great
difficulty
and
in
rough
weather
not
at
all
when
it
was
reached
what
remained
of
the
men
in
the
ships
had
first
to
be
disembarked
and
then
conveyed
up
a
steep
slope
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
nearest
of
the
hospitals
the
most
serious
cases
might
be
put
upon
stretchers
for
there
were
far
too
few
for
all
the
rest
were
carried
or
dragged
up
the
hill
by
such
convalescent
soldiers
as
could
be
got
together
who
were
not
too
obviously
infirm
for
the
work
at
last
the
journey
was
accomplished
slowly
one
by
one
living
or
dying
the
wounded
were
carried
up
into
the
hospital
and
in
the
hospital
what
did
they
find
lasciate
ogni
speranza
voi
the
delusive
doors
bore
no
such
inscription
and
yet
behind
them
hell
yawned
want
neglect
confusion
misery
in
every
shape
and
in
every
degree
of
intensity
filled
the
endless
corridors
and
the
vast
apartments
of
the
gigantic
which
without
forethought
or
preparation
had
been
hurriedly
set
aside
as
the
chief
shelter
for
the
victims
of
the
war
the
very
building
itself
was
radically
defective
huge
sewers
underlay
it
and
cesspools
loaded
with
filth
wafted
their
poison
into
the
upper
rooms
the
floors
were
in
so
rotten
a
condition
that
many
of
them
could
not
be
scrubbed
the
walls
were
thick
with
dirt
incredible
multitudes
of
vermin
swarmed
everywhere
and
enormous
as
the
building
was
it
was
yet
too
small
it
contained
four
miles
of
beds
crushed
together
so
close
that
there
was
but
just
room
to
pass
between
them
under
such
conditions
the
most
elaborate
system
of
ventilation
might
well
have
been
at
fault
but
here
there
was
no
ventilation
the
stench
was
indescribable
have
been
well
acquainted
said
miss
nightingale
the
dwellings
of
the
worst
parts
of
most
of
the
great
cities
in
europe
but
have
never
been
in
any
atmosphere
which
i
could
compare
with
that
of
the
barrack
hospital
at
night
the
structural
defects
were
equalled
by
the
deficiencies
in
the
commonest
objects
of
hospital
use
there
were
not
enough
bedsteads
the
sheets
were
of
canvas
and
so
coarse
that
the
wounded
men
recoiled
from
them
begging
to
be
left
in
their
blankets
there
was
no
bedroom
furniture
of
any
kind
and
empty
beer
bottles
were
used
for
candlesticks
there
were
no
basins
no
towels
no
soap
no
brooms
no
mops
no
trays
no
plates
there
were
neither
slippers
nor
scissors
neither
nor
blacking
there
were
no
knives
or
forks
or
spoons
the
supply
of
fuel
was
constantly
deficient
the
cooking
arrangements
were
preposterously
inadequate
and
the
laundry
was
a
farce
as
for
purely
medical
materials
the
tale
was
no
better
stretchers
splints
bandages
all
were
lacking
and
so
were
the
most
ordinary
drugs
to
replace
such
wants
to
struggle
against
such
difficulties
there
was
a
handful
of
men
overburdened
by
the
strain
of
ceaseless
work
bound
down
by
the
traditions
of
official
routine
and
enfeebled
either
by
old
age
or
inexperience
or
sheer
incompetence
they
had
proved
utterly
unequal
to
their
task
the
principal
doctor
was
lost
in
the
imbecilities
of
a
senile
optimism
the
wretched
official
whose
business
it
was
to
provide
for
the
wants
of
the
hospital
was
tied
fast
hand
and
foot
by
red
tape
a
few
of
the
younger
doctors
struggled
valiantly
but
what
could
they
do
unprepared
disorganised
with
such
help
only
as
they
could
find
among
the
miserable
band
of
convalescent
soldiers
drafted
off
to
tend
their
sick
comrades
they
were
faced
with
disease
mutilation
and
death
in
all
their
most
appalling
forms
crowded
multitudinously
about
them
in
an
mass
they
were
like
men
in
a
shipwreck
fighting
not
for
safety
but
for
the
next
moment
bare
existence
to
gain
by
yet
another
frenzied
effort
some
brief
respite
from
the
waters
of
destruction
in
these
surroundings
those
who
had
been
long
inured
to
scenes
of
human
suffering
surgeons
with
a
knowledge
of
agonies
soldiers
familiar
with
fields
of
carnage
missionaries
with
remembrances
of
famine
and
of
plague
yet
found
a
depth
of
horror
which
they
had
never
known
before
there
were
moments
there
were
places
in
the
barrack
hospital
at
scutari
where
the
strongest
hand
was
struck
with
trembling
and
the
boldest
eye
would
turn
away
its
gaze
miss
nightingale
came
and
she
at
any
rate
in
that
inferno
did
not
abandon
hope
for
one
thing
she
brought
material
succour
before
she
left
london
she
had
consulted
andrew
smith
the
head
of
the
army
medical
board
as
to
whether
it
would
be
useful
to
take
out
stores
of
any
kind
to
scutari
and
andrew
smith
had
told
her
that
was
needed
even
sidney
herbert
had
given
her
similar
assurances
possibly
owing
to
an
oversight
there
might
have
been
some
delay
in
the
delivery
of
the
medical
stores
which
he
said
had
been
sent
out
from
england
profusion
but
days
would
have
remedied
this
she
preferred
to
trust
her
own
instincts
and
at
marseilles
purchased
a
large
quantity
of
miscellaneous
provisions
which
were
of
the
utmost
use
at
scutari
she
came
too
amply
provided
with
money
in
all
during
her
stay
in
the
east
about
reached
her
from
private
sources
and
in
addition
she
was
able
to
avail
herself
of
another
valuable
means
of
help
at
the
same
time
as
herself
macdonald
of
the
times
had
arrived
at
scutari
charged
with
the
duty
of
administering
the
large
sums
of
money
collected
through
the
agency
of
that
newspaper
in
aid
of
the
sick
and
wounded
and
macdonald
had
the
sense
to
see
that
the
best
use
he
could
make
of
the
times
fund
was
to
put
it
at
the
disposal
of
miss
nightingale
can
not
conceive
wrote
an
i
now
calmly
look
back
on
the
first
three
weeks
after
the
arrival
of
the
wounded
from
inkerman
how
it
could
have
been
possible
to
have
avoided
a
state
of
things
too
disastrous
to
contemplate
had
not
miss
nightingale
been
there
with
the
means
placed
at
her
disposal
by
mr
macdonald
but
the
official
view
was
different
what
was
the
public
service
to
admit
by
accepting
outside
charity
that
it
was
unable
to
discharge
its
own
duties
without
the
assistance
of
private
and
irregular
benevolence
never
and
accordingly
when
lord
stratford
de
redcliffe
our
ambassador
at
constantinople
was
asked
by
macdonald
to
indicate
how
the
times
fund
could
best
be
employed
he
answered
that
there
was
indeed
one
object
to
which
it
might
very
well
be
devoted
the
building
of
an
english
protestant
church
at
pera
macdonald
did
not
waste
further
time
with
lord
stratford
and
immediately
joined
forces
with
miss
nightingale
but
with
such
a
frame
of
mind
in
the
highest
quarters
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
kind
of
disgust
and
alarm
with
which
the
sudden
intrusion
of
a
band
of
amateurs
and
females
must
have
filled
the
minds
of
the
ordinary
officer
and
the
ordinary
military
surgeon
they
could
not
understand
it
what
had
women
to
do
with
war
honest
colonels
relieved
their
spleen
by
the
cracking
of
heavy
jokes
about
bird
while
poor
hall
a
rough
terrier
of
a
man
who
had
worried
his
way
to
the
top
of
his
profession
was
struck
speechless
with
astonishment
and
at
last
observed
that
miss
nightingale
appointment
was
extremely
droll
her
position
was
indeed
an
official
one
but
it
was
hardly
the
easier
for
that
in
the
hospitals
it
was
her
duty
to
provide
the
services
of
herself
and
her
nurses
when
they
were
asked
for
by
the
doctors
and
not
until
then
at
first
some
of
the
surgeons
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
her
and
though
she
was
welcomed
by
others
the
majority
were
hostile
and
suspicious
but
gradually
she
gained
ground
her
good
will
could
not
be
denied
and
her
capacity
could
not
be
disregarded
with
consummate
tact
with
all
the
gentleness
of
supreme
strength
she
managed
at
last
to
impose
her
personality
upon
the
susceptible
overwrought
discouraged
and
helpless
group
of
men
in
authority
who
surrounded
her
she
stood
firm
she
was
a
rock
in
the
angry
ocean
with
her
alone
was
safety
comfort
life
and
so
it
was
that
hope
dawned
at
scutari
the
reign
of
chaos
and
old
night
began
to
dwindle
order
came
upon
the
scene
and
common
sense
and
forethought
and
decision
radiating
out
from
the
little
room
off
the
great
gallery
in
the
barrack
hospital
where
day
and
night
the
lady
superintendent
was
at
her
task
progress
might
be
slow
but
it
was
sure
the
first
sign
of
a
great
change
came
with
the
appearance
of
some
of
those
necessary
objects
with
which
the
hospitals
had
been
unprovided
for
months
the
sick
men
began
to
enjoy
the
use
of
towels
and
soap
knives
and
forks
combs
and
hall
might
snort
when
he
heard
of
it
asking
with
a
growl
what
a
soldier
wanted
with
a
but
the
good
work
went
on
eventually
the
whole
business
of
purveying
to
the
hospitals
was
in
effect
carried
out
by
miss
nightingale
she
alone
it
seemed
whatever
the
contingency
knew
where
to
lay
her
hands
on
what
was
wanted
she
alone
could
dispense
her
stores
with
readiness
above
all
she
alone
possessed
the
art
of
circumventing
the
pernicious
influences
of
official
etiquette
this
was
her
greatest
enemy
and
sometimes
even
she
was
baffled
by
it
on
one
occasion
shirts
sent
out
at
her
instance
by
the
home
government
arrived
were
landed
and
were
only
waiting
to
be
unpacked
but
the
official
intervened
could
not
unpack
them
he
said
out
a
board
miss
nightingale
pleaded
in
vain
the
sick
and
wounded
lay
shivering
for
want
of
clothing
and
three
weeks
elapsed
before
the
board
released
the
shirts
a
little
later
however
on
a
similar
occasion
miss
nightingale
felt
that
she
could
assert
her
own
authority
she
ordered
a
government
consignment
to
be
forcibly
opened
while
the
miserable
stood
by
wringing
his
hands
in
departmental
agony
vast
quantities
of
valuable
stores
sent
from
england
lay
she
found
engulfed
in
the
bottomless
abyss
of
the
turkish
customs
house
other
buried
beneath
munitions
of
war
destined
for
balaclava
passed
scutari
without
a
sign
and
thus
hospital
materials
were
sometimes
carried
to
and
fro
three
times
over
the
black
sea
before
they
reached
their
destination
the
whole
system
was
clearly
at
fault
and
miss
nightingale
suggested
to
the
home
authorities
that
a
government
store
house
should
be
instituted
at
scutari
for
the
reception
and
distribution
of
the
consignments
six
months
after
her
arrival
this
was
done
in
the
meantime
she
had
reorganised
the
kitchens
and
the
laundries
in
the
hospitals
the
hunks
of
meat
vilely
served
at
irregular
intervals
which
had
hitherto
been
the
only
diet
for
the
sick
men
were
replaced
by
punctual
meals
and
appetising
while
strengthening
extra
foods
soups
and
wines
and
jellies
luxuries
snarled
hall
were
distributed
to
those
who
needed
them
one
thing
however
she
could
not
effect
the
separation
of
the
bones
from
the
meat
was
no
part
of
official
cookery
the
rule
was
that
the
food
must
be
divided
into
equal
portions
and
if
some
of
the
portions
were
all
bone
well
every
man
must
take
his
chance
the
rule
perhaps
was
not
a
very
good
one
but
there
it
was
would
require
a
new
regulation
of
the
service
she
was
told
bone
the
meat
as
for
the
washing
arrangements
they
were
revolutionised
up
to
the
time
of
miss
nightingale
arrival
the
number
of
shirts
the
authorities
had
succeeded
in
washing
was
seven
the
hospital
bedding
she
found
was
in
cold
water
she
took
a
turkish
house
had
boilers
installed
and
employed
soldiers
wives
to
do
the
laundry
work
the
expenses
were
defrayed
from
her
own
funds
and
that
of
the
times
and
henceforward
the
sick
and
wounded
had
the
comfort
of
clean
linen
then
she
turned
her
attention
to
their
clothing
owing
to
military
exigencies
the
greater
number
of
the
men
had
abandoned
their
kit
their
knapsacks
were
lost
forever
they
possessed
nothing
but
what
was
on
their
persons
and
that
was
usually
only
fit
for
speedy
destruction
the
of
course
pointed
out
that
according
to
the
regulations
all
soldiers
should
bring
with
them
into
hospital
an
adequate
supply
of
clothing
and
he
declared
that
it
was
no
business
of
his
to
make
good
their
deficiencies
apparently
it
was
the
business
of
miss
nightingale
she
procured
socks
boots
and
shirts
in
enormous
quantities
she
had
trousers
made
she
rigged
up
fact
is
she
told
sidney
herbert
i
am
now
clothing
the
british
army
all
at
once
word
came
from
the
crimea
that
a
great
new
contingent
of
sick
and
wounded
might
shortly
be
expected
where
were
they
to
go
every
available
inch
in
the
wards
was
occupied
the
affair
was
serious
and
pressing
and
the
authorities
stood
aghast
there
were
some
dilapidated
rooms
in
the
barrack
hospital
unfit
for
human
habitation
but
miss
nightingale
believed
that
if
measures
were
promptly
taken
they
might
be
made
capable
of
accommodating
several
hundred
beds
one
of
the
doctors
agreed
with
her
the
rest
of
the
officials
were
irresolute
it
would
be
a
very
expensive
job
they
said
it
would
involve
building
and
who
could
take
the
responsibility
the
proper
course
was
that
a
representation
should
be
made
to
the
of
the
army
medical
department
in
london
then
the
would
apply
to
the
horse
guards
the
horse
guards
would
move
the
ordnance
the
ordnance
would
lay
the
matter
before
the
treasury
and
if
the
treasury
gave
its
consent
the
work
might
be
correctly
carried
through
several
months
after
the
necessity
for
it
had
disappeared
miss
nightingale
however
had
made
up
her
mind
and
she
persuaded
lord
stratford
or
thought
she
had
persuaded
him
to
give
his
sanction
to
the
required
expenditure
one
hundred
and
workmen
were
immediately
engaged
and
the
work
was
begun
the
workmen
struck
whereupon
lord
stratford
washed
his
hands
of
the
whole
business
miss
nightingale
engaged
other
workmen
on
her
own
authority
and
paid
the
bill
out
of
her
own
resources
the
wards
were
ready
by
the
required
date
sick
men
were
received
in
them
and
all
the
utensils
including
knives
forks
spoons
cans
and
towels
were
supplied
by
miss
nightingale
this
remarkable
woman
was
in
truth
performing
the
function
of
an
administrative
chief
how
had
this
come
about
was
she
not
in
reality
merely
a
nurse
was
it
not
her
duty
simply
to
tend
the
sick
and
indeed
was
it
not
as
a
ministering
angel
a
gentle
with
a
lamp
that
she
actually
impressed
the
minds
of
her
contemporaries
no
doubt
that
was
so
and
yet
it
is
no
less
certain
that
as
she
herself
said
the
specific
business
of
nursing
was
least
important
of
the
functions
into
which
she
had
been
forced
it
was
clear
that
in
the
state
of
disorganisation
into
which
the
hospitals
at
scutari
had
fallen
the
most
pressing
the
really
vital
need
was
for
something
more
than
nursing
it
was
for
the
necessary
elements
of
civilised
life
the
commonest
material
objects
the
most
ordinary
cleanliness
the
rudimentary
habits
of
order
and
authority
dear
miss
nightingale
said
one
of
her
party
as
they
were
approaching
constantinople
we
land
let
there
be
no
delays
let
us
get
straight
to
nursing
the
poor
fellows
strongest
will
be
wanted
at
the
was
miss
nightingale
answer
and
it
was
upon
the
and
all
that
the
stood
for
that
she
expended
her
greatest
energies
yet
to
say
that
is
perhaps
to
say
too
much
for
to
those
who
watched
her
at
work
among
the
sick
moving
day
and
night
from
bed
to
bed
with
that
unflinching
courage
with
that
indefatigable
vigilance
it
seemed
as
if
the
concentrated
force
of
an
undivided
and
unparalleled
devotion
could
hardly
suffice
for
that
portion
of
her
task
alone
wherever
in
those
vast
wards
suffering
was
at
its
worst
and
the
need
for
help
was
greatest
there
as
if
by
magic
was
miss
nightingale
her
superhuman
equanimity
would
at
the
moment
of
some
ghastly
operation
nerve
the
victim
to
endure
and
almost
to
hope
her
sympathy
would
assuage
the
pangs
of
dying
and
bring
back
to
those
still
living
something
of
the
forgotten
charm
of
life
over
and
over
again
her
untiring
efforts
rescued
those
whom
the
surgeons
had
abandoned
as
beyond
the
possibility
of
cure
her
mere
presence
brought
with
it
a
strange
influence
a
passionate
idolatry
spread
among
the
men
they
kissed
her
shadow
as
it
passed
they
did
more
she
came
said
a
soldier
was
cussin
and
swearin
but
after
that
it
was
as
as
a
church
the
most
cherished
privilege
of
the
fighting
man
was
abandoned
for
the
sake
of
miss
nightingale
in
those
sinks
of
human
misery
as
she
herself
put
it
she
never
heard
the
use
of
one
expression
could
distress
a
gentlewoman
she
was
heroic
and
these
were
the
humble
tributes
paid
by
those
of
grosser
mould
to
that
high
quality
certainly
she
was
heroic
yet
her
heroism
was
not
of
that
simple
sort
so
dear
to
the
readers
of
novels
and
the
compilers
of
hagiologies
the
romantic
sentimental
heroism
with
which
mankind
loves
to
invest
its
chosen
darlings
it
was
made
of
sterner
stuff
to
the
wounded
soldier
on
his
couch
of
agony
she
might
well
appear
in
the
guise
of
a
gracious
angel
of
mercy
but
the
military
surgeons
and
the
orderlies
and
her
own
nurses
and
the
and
hall
and
even
lord
stratford
himself
could
tell
a
different
story
it
was
not
by
gentle
sweetness
and
womanly
that
she
had
brought
order
out
of
chaos
in
the
scutari
hospitals
that
from
her
own
resources
she
had
clothed
the
british
army
that
she
had
spread
her
dominion
over
the
serried
and
reluctant
powers
of
the
official
world
it
was
by
strict
method
by
stern
discipline
by
rigid
attention
to
detail
by
ceaseless
labour
and
by
the
fixed
determination
of
an
indomitable
will
beneath
her
cool
and
calm
demeanour
lurked
fierce
and
passionate
fires
as
she
passed
through
the
wards
in
her
plain
dress
so
quiet
so
unassuming
she
struck
the
casual
observer
simply
as
the
pattern
of
a
perfect
lady
but
the
keener
eye
perceived
something
more
than
that
the
serenity
of
high
deliberation
in
the
scope
of
the
capacious
brow
the
sign
of
power
in
the
dominating
curve
of
the
thin
nose
and
the
traces
of
a
harsh
and
dangerous
temper
something
peevish
something
mocking
and
yet
something
precise
in
the
small
and
delicate
mouth
there
was
humour
in
the
face
but
the
curious
watcher
might
wonder
whether
it
was
humour
of
a
very
pleasant
kind
might
ask
himself
even
as
he
heard
the
laughter
and
marked
the
jokes
with
which
she
cheered
the
spirits
of
her
patients
what
sort
of
sardonic
merriment
this
same
lady
might
not
give
vent
to
in
the
privacy
of
her
chamber
as
for
her
voice
it
was
true
of
it
even
more
than
of
her
countenance
that
it
that
in
it
one
must
fain
call
master
those
clear
tones
were
in
no
need
of
emphasis
never
heard
her
raise
her
voice
said
one
of
her
companions
when
she
had
spoken
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
could
follow
but
obedience
once
when
she
had
given
some
direction
a
doctor
ventured
to
remark
that
the
thing
could
not
be
done
it
must
be
done
said
miss
nightingale
a
chance
bystander
who
heard
the
words
never
forgot
through
all
his
life
the
irresistible
authority
of
them
and
they
were
spoken
quietly
very
quietly
indeed
late
at
night
when
the
long
miles
of
beds
lay
wrapped
in
darkness
miss
nightingale
would
sit
at
work
in
her
little
room
over
her
correspondence
it
was
one
of
the
most
formidable
of
all
her
duties
there
were
hundreds
of
letters
to
be
written
to
the
friends
and
relations
of
soldiers
there
was
the
enormous
mass
of
official
documents
to
be
dealt
with
there
were
her
own
private
letters
to
be
answered
and
most
important
of
all
there
was
the
composition
of
her
long
and
confidential
reports
to
sidney
herbert
these
were
by
no
means
official
communications
her
soul
pent
up
all
day
in
the
restraint
and
reserve
of
a
vast
responsibility
now
at
last
poured
itself
out
in
these
letters
with
all
its
natural
vehemence
like
a
swollen
torrent
through
an
open
sluice
here
at
least
she
did
not
mince
matters
here
she
painted
in
her
darkest
colours
the
hideous
scenes
which
surrounded
her
here
she
tore
away
remorselessly
the
last
veils
still
shrouding
the
abominable
truth
then
she
would
fill
pages
with
recommendations
and
suggestions
with
criticisms
of
the
minutest
details
of
organisation
with
elaborate
calculations
of
contingencies
with
exhaustive
analyses
and
statistical
statements
piled
up
in
breathless
eagerness
one
on
the
top
of
the
other
and
then
her
pen
in
the
virulence
of
its
volubility
would
rush
on
to
the
discussion
of
individuals
to
the
denunciation
of
an
incompetent
surgeon
or
the
ridicule
of
a
nurse
her
sarcasm
searched
the
ranks
of
the
officials
with
the
deadly
and
unsparing
precision
of
a
her
nicknames
were
terrible
she
respected
no
one
lord
stratford
lord
raglan
lady
stratford
andrew
smith
hall
the
the
purveyor
she
fulminated
against
them
all
the
intolerable
futility
of
mankind
obsessed
her
like
a
nightmare
and
she
gnashed
her
teeth
against
it
do
well
to
be
angry
was
the
burden
of
her
cry
many
just
men
were
there
at
scutari
how
many
who
cared
at
all
for
the
sick
or
had
done
anything
for
their
relief
were
there
ten
were
there
five
was
there
even
one
she
could
not
be
sure
at
one
time
during
several
weeks
her
vituperations
descended
upon
the
head
of
sidney
herbert
himself
he
had
misinterpreted
her
wishes
he
had
traversed
her
positive
instructions
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
admitted
his
error
and
apologised
in
abject
terms
that
he
was
allowed
again
into
favour
while
this
misunderstanding
was
at
its
height
an
aristocratic
young
gentleman
arrived
at
scutari
with
a
recommendation
from
the
minister
he
had
come
out
from
england
filled
with
a
romantic
desire
to
render
homage
to
the
angelic
heroine
of
his
dreams
he
had
he
said
cast
aside
his
life
of
ease
and
luxury
he
would
devote
his
days
and
nights
to
the
service
of
that
gentle
lady
he
would
perform
the
most
menial
offices
he
would
for
her
he
would
be
her
footman
and
feel
requited
by
a
single
smile
a
single
smile
indeed
he
had
but
it
was
of
an
unexpected
kind
miss
nightingale
at
first
refused
to
see
him
and
then
when
she
consented
believing
that
he
was
an
emissary
sent
by
sidney
herbert
to
put
her
in
the
wrong
over
their
dispute
she
took
notes
of
her
conversation
with
him
and
insisted
on
his
signing
them
at
the
end
of
it
the
young
gentleman
returned
to
england
by
the
next
ship
this
quarrel
with
sidney
herbert
was
however
an
exceptional
incident
alike
by
him
and
by
lord
panmure
his
successor
at
the
war
office
she
was
firmly
supported
and
the
fact
that
during
the
whole
of
her
stay
at
scutari
she
had
the
home
government
at
her
back
was
her
trump
card
in
her
dealings
with
the
hospital
authorities
nor
was
it
only
the
government
that
was
behind
her
public
opinion
in
england
early
recognised
the
high
importance
of
her
mission
and
its
enthusiastic
appreciation
of
her
work
soon
reached
an
extraordinary
height
the
queen
herself
was
deeply
moved
she
made
repeated
inquiries
as
to
the
welfare
of
miss
nightingale
she
asked
to
see
her
accounts
of
the
wounded
and
made
her
the
intermediary
between
the
throne
and
the
troops
herbert
know
she
wrote
to
the
war
minister
i
wish
miss
nightingale
and
the
ladies
would
tell
these
poor
noble
wounded
and
sick
men
that
no
one
takes
a
warmer
interest
or
feels
more
for
their
sufferings
or
admires
their
courage
and
heroism
more
than
their
queen
day
and
night
she
thinks
of
her
beloved
troops
so
does
the
prince
beg
herbert
to
communicate
these
my
words
to
those
ladies
as
i
know
that
our
sympathy
is
much
valued
by
these
noble
fellows
the
letter
was
read
aloud
in
the
wards
by
the
chaplain
is
a
very
feeling
letter
said
the
men
and
so
the
months
passed
and
that
fell
winter
which
had
begun
with
inkerman
and
had
dragged
itself
out
through
the
long
agony
of
the
investment
of
sebastopol
at
last
was
over
in
may
after
six
months
of
labour
miss
nightingale
could
look
with
something
like
satisfaction
at
the
condition
of
the
scutari
hospitals
had
they
done
nothing
more
than
survive
the
terrible
strain
which
had
been
put
upon
them
it
would
have
been
a
matter
for
congratulation
but
they
had
done
much
more
than
that
they
had
marvellously
improved
the
confusion
and
the
pressure
in
the
wards
had
come
to
an
end
order
reigned
in
them
and
cleanliness
the
supplies
were
bountiful
and
prompt
important
sanitary
works
had
been
carried
out
one
simple
comparison
of
figures
was
enough
to
reveal
the
extraordinary
change
the
rate
of
mortality
among
the
cases
treated
had
fallen
from
percent
to
per
but
still
the
indefatigable
lady
was
not
satisfied
the
main
problem
had
been
solved
the
physical
needs
of
the
men
had
been
provided
for
their
mental
and
spiritual
needs
remained
she
set
up
and
furnished
and
recreation
rooms
she
started
classes
and
lectures
officers
were
amazed
to
see
her
treating
their
men
as
if
they
were
human
beings
and
assured
her
that
she
would
only
end
by
the
brutes
but
that
was
not
miss
nightingale
opinion
and
she
was
justified
the
private
soldier
began
to
drink
less
and
even
though
that
seemed
impossible
to
save
his
pay
miss
nightingale
became
a
banker
for
the
army
receiving
and
sending
home
large
sums
of
money
every
month
at
last
reluctantly
the
government
followed
suit
and
established
machinery
of
its
own
for
the
remission
of
money
lord
panmure
however
remained
sceptical
will
do
no
good
he
pronounced
british
soldier
is
not
a
remitting
animal
but
in
fact
during
the
next
six
months
was
sent
home
amid
all
these
activities
miss
nightingale
took
up
the
further
task
of
inspecting
the
hospitals
in
the
crimea
itself
the
labour
was
extreme
and
the
conditions
of
life
were
almost
intolerable
she
spent
whole
days
in
the
saddle
or
was
driven
over
those
bleak
and
rocky
heights
in
a
baggage
cart
sometimes
she
stood
for
hours
in
the
heavily
failing
snow
and
would
only
reach
her
hut
at
dead
of
night
after
walking
for
miles
through
perilous
ravines
her
powers
of
resistance
seemed
incredible
but
at
last
they
were
exhausted
she
was
attacked
by
fever
and
for
a
moment
came
very
near
to
death
yet
she
worked
on
if
she
could
not
move
she
could
at
least
write
and
write
she
did
until
her
mind
had
left
her
and
after
it
had
left
her
in
what
seemed
the
delirious
trance
of
death
itself
she
still
wrote
when
after
many
weeks
she
was
strong
enough
to
travel
she
was
implored
to
return
to
england
but
she
utterly
refused
she
would
not
go
back
she
said
before
the
last
of
the
soldiers
had
left
scutari
this
happy
moment
had
almost
arrived
when
suddenly
the
smouldering
hostilities
of
the
medical
authorities
burst
out
into
a
flame
hall
labours
had
been
rewarded
by
a
letters
which
as
miss
nightingale
told
sidney
herbert
she
could
only
suppose
to
mean
of
the
crimean
and
the
honour
had
turned
his
head
he
was
sir
john
and
he
would
be
thwarted
no
longer
disputes
had
lately
arisen
between
miss
nightingale
and
some
of
the
nurses
in
the
crimean
hospitals
the
situation
had
been
embittered
by
rumours
of
religious
dissensions
while
the
crimean
nurses
were
roman
catholics
many
of
those
at
scutari
were
suspected
of
a
regrettable
propensity
towards
the
tenets
of
pusey
miss
nightingale
was
by
no
means
disturbed
by
these
sectarian
differences
but
any
suggestion
that
her
supreme
authority
over
all
the
nurses
with
the
army
was
no
doubt
enough
to
rouse
her
to
fury
and
it
appeared
that
bridgeman
the
reverend
mother
in
the
crimea
had
ventured
to
call
that
authority
in
question
sir
john
hall
thought
that
his
opportunity
had
come
and
strongly
supported
bridgeman
or
as
miss
nightingale
preferred
to
call
her
the
brickbat
there
was
a
violent
struggle
miss
nightingale
rage
was
terrible
hall
she
declared
was
doing
his
best
to
her
out
of
the
crimea
she
would
bear
it
no
longer
the
war
office
was
playing
her
false
there
was
only
one
thing
to
be
done
sidney
herbert
must
move
for
the
production
of
papers
in
the
house
of
commons
so
that
the
public
might
be
able
to
judge
between
her
and
her
enemies
sidney
herbert
with
great
difficulty
calmed
her
down
orders
were
immediately
dispatched
putting
her
supremacy
beyond
doubt
and
the
reverend
brickbat
withdrew
from
the
scene
sir
john
however
was
more
tenacious
a
few
weeks
later
miss
nightingale
and
her
nurses
visited
the
crimea
for
the
last
time
and
the
brilliant
idea
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
crush
her
by
a
very
simple
expedient
he
would
starve
her
into
submission
and
he
actually
ordered
that
no
rations
of
any
kind
should
be
supplied
to
her
he
had
already
tried
this
plan
with
great
effect
upon
an
unfortunate
medical
man
whose
presence
in
the
crimea
he
had
considered
an
intrusion
but
he
was
now
to
learn
that
such
tricks
were
thrown
away
upon
miss
nightingale
with
extraordinary
foresight
she
had
brought
with
her
a
great
supply
of
food
she
succeeded
in
obtaining
more
at
her
own
expense
and
by
her
own
exertions
and
thus
for
ten
days
in
that
inhospitable
country
she
was
able
to
feed
herself
and
nurses
eventually
the
military
authorities
intervened
in
her
favour
and
sir
john
had
to
confess
that
he
was
beaten
it
was
not
until
july
four
months
after
the
declaration
of
peace
that
miss
nightingale
left
scutari
for
england
her
reputation
was
now
enormous
and
the
enthusiasm
of
the
public
was
unbounded
the
royal
approbation
was
expressed
by
the
gift
of
a
brooch
accompanied
by
a
private
letter
are
i
know
well
aware
wrote
her
majesty
the
high
sense
i
entertain
of
the
christian
devotion
which
you
have
displayed
during
this
great
and
bloody
war
and
i
need
hardly
repeat
to
you
how
warm
my
admiration
is
for
your
services
which
are
fully
equal
to
those
of
my
dear
and
brave
soldiers
whose
sufferings
you
have
had
the
privilege
of
alleviating
in
so
merciful
a
manner
i
am
however
anxious
of
marking
my
feelings
in
a
manner
which
i
trust
will
be
agreeable
to
you
and
therefore
send
you
with
this
letter
a
brooch
the
form
and
emblems
of
which
commemorate
your
great
and
blessed
work
and
which
i
hope
you
will
wear
as
a
mark
of
the
high
approbation
of
your
sovereign
will
be
a
very
great
satisfaction
to
me
her
majesty
added
make
the
acquaintance
of
one
who
has
set
so
bright
an
example
to
our
sex
the
brooch
which
was
designed
by
the
prince
consort
bore
a
george
cross
in
red
enamel
and
the
royal
cipher
surmounted
by
diamonds
the
whole
was
encircled
by
the
inscription
are
the
merciful
iii
the
name
of
florence
nightingale
lives
in
the
memory
of
the
world
by
virtue
of
the
lurid
and
heroic
adventure
of
the
crimea
had
she
died
as
she
nearly
did
upon
her
return
to
england
her
reputation
would
hardly
have
been
different
her
legend
would
have
come
down
to
us
almost
as
we
know
it
today
that
gentle
vision
of
female
virtue
which
first
took
shape
before
the
adoring
eyes
of
the
sick
soldiers
at
scutari
yet
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
lived
for
more
than
half
a
century
after
the
crimean
war
and
during
the
greater
part
of
that
long
period
all
the
energy
and
all
the
devotion
of
her
extraordinary
nature
were
working
at
their
highest
pitch
what
she
accomplished
in
those
years
of
unknown
labour
could
indeed
hardly
have
been
more
glorious
than
her
crimean
triumphs
but
it
was
certainly
more
important
the
true
history
was
far
stranger
even
than
the
myth
in
miss
nightingale
own
eyes
the
adventure
of
the
crimea
was
a
mere
incident
scarcely
more
than
a
useful
in
her
career
it
was
the
fulcrum
with
which
she
hoped
to
move
the
world
but
it
was
only
the
fulcrum
for
more
than
a
generation
she
was
to
sit
in
secret
working
her
lever
and
her
real
life
began
at
the
very
moment
when
in
the
popular
imagination
it
had
ended
she
arrived
in
england
in
a
shattered
state
of
health
the
hardships
and
the
ceaseless
effort
of
the
last
two
years
had
undermined
her
nervous
system
her
heart
was
pronounced
to
be
affected
she
suffered
constantly
from
and
terrible
attacks
of
utter
physical
prostration
the
doctors
declared
that
one
thing
alone
would
save
her
a
complete
and
prolonged
rest
but
that
was
also
the
one
thing
with
which
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
she
had
never
been
in
the
habit
of
resting
why
should
she
begin
now
now
when
her
opportunity
had
come
at
last
now
when
the
iron
was
hot
and
it
was
time
to
strike
no
she
had
work
to
do
and
come
what
might
she
would
do
it
the
doctors
protested
in
vain
in
vain
her
family
lamented
and
entreated
in
vain
her
friends
pointed
out
to
her
the
madness
of
such
a
course
madness
mad
possessed
perhaps
she
was
a
demoniac
frenzy
had
seized
upon
her
as
she
lay
upon
her
sofa
gasping
she
devoured
dictated
letters
and
in
the
intervals
of
her
palpitations
cracked
her
febrile
jokes
for
months
at
a
stretch
she
never
left
her
bed
for
years
she
was
in
daily
expectation
of
death
but
she
would
not
rest
at
this
rate
the
doctors
assured
her
even
if
she
did
not
die
she
would
become
an
invalid
for
life
she
could
not
help
that
there
was
the
work
to
be
done
and
as
for
rest
very
likely
she
might
rest
when
she
had
done
it
wherever
she
went
in
london
or
in
the
country
in
the
hills
of
derbyshire
or
among
the
rhododendrons
at
embley
she
was
haunted
by
a
ghost
it
was
the
spectre
of
scutari
the
hideous
vision
of
the
organisation
of
a
military
hospital
she
would
lay
that
phantom
or
she
would
perish
the
whole
system
of
the
army
medical
department
the
education
of
the
medical
officer
the
regulations
of
hospital
procedure
rest
how
could
she
rest
while
these
things
were
as
they
were
while
if
the
like
necessity
were
to
arise
again
the
like
results
would
follow
and
even
in
peace
and
at
home
what
was
the
sanitary
condition
of
the
army
the
mortality
in
the
barracks
was
she
found
nearly
double
the
mortality
in
civil
life
might
as
well
take
men
every
year
out
upon
salisbury
plain
and
shoot
them
she
said
after
inspecting
the
hospitals
at
chatham
she
smiled
grimly
this
is
one
more
symptom
of
the
system
which
in
the
crimea
put
to
death
men
scutari
had
given
her
knowledge
and
it
had
given
her
power
too
her
enormous
reputation
was
at
her
back
an
incalculable
force
other
work
other
duties
might
lie
before
her
but
the
most
urgent
the
most
obvious
of
all
was
to
look
to
the
health
of
the
army
one
of
her
very
first
steps
was
to
take
advantage
of
the
invitation
which
queen
victoria
had
sent
her
to
the
crimea
together
with
the
commemorative
brooch
within
a
few
weeks
of
her
return
she
visited
balmoral
and
had
several
interviews
with
both
the
queen
and
the
prince
consort
put
before
us
wrote
the
prince
in
his
diary
the
defects
of
our
present
military
hospital
system
and
the
reforms
that
are
needed
she
related
whole
story
of
her
experiences
in
the
east
and
in
addition
she
managed
to
have
some
long
and
confidential
talks
with
his
royal
highness
on
metaphysics
and
religion
the
impression
which
she
created
was
excellent
gefallt
uns
sehr
noted
the
prince
sehr
bescheiden
her
majesty
comment
was
different
a
head
i
wish
we
had
her
at
the
war
office
but
miss
nightingale
was
not
at
the
war
office
and
for
a
very
simple
reason
she
was
a
woman
lord
panmure
however
was
though
indeed
the
reason
for
that
was
not
quite
so
simple
and
it
was
upon
lord
panmure
that
the
issue
of
miss
nightingale
efforts
for
reform
must
primarily
depend
that
burly
scottish
nobleman
had
not
in
spite
of
his
most
earnest
endeavours
had
a
very
easy
time
of
it
as
secretary
of
state
for
war
he
had
come
into
office
in
the
middle
of
the
sebastopol
campaign
and
had
felt
himself
very
well
fitted
for
the
position
since
he
had
acquired
in
former
days
an
inside
knowledge
of
the
army
as
a
captain
of
hussars
it
was
this
inside
knowledge
which
had
enabled
him
to
inform
miss
nightingale
with
such
authority
that
british
soldier
is
not
a
remitting
animal
and
perhaps
it
was
this
same
consciousness
of
a
command
of
his
subject
which
had
impelled
him
to
write
a
dispatch
to
lord
raglan
blandly
informing
the
in
the
field
just
how
he
was
neglecting
his
duties
and
pointing
out
to
him
that
if
he
would
only
try
he
really
might
do
a
little
better
next
time
lord
raglan
reply
calculated
as
it
was
to
make
its
recipient
sink
into
the
earth
did
not
quite
have
that
effect
upon
lord
panmure
who
whatever
might
have
been
his
faults
had
never
been
accused
of
being
supersensitive
however
he
allowed
the
matter
to
drop
and
a
little
later
lord
raglan
died
worn
out
some
people
said
by
work
and
anxiety
he
was
succeeded
by
an
excellent
old
gentleman
general
simpson
whom
nobody
has
ever
heard
of
and
who
took
sebastopol
but
lord
panmure
relations
with
him
were
hardly
more
satisfactory
than
his
relations
with
lord
raglan
for
while
lord
raglan
had
been
too
independent
poor
general
simpson
erred
in
the
opposite
direction
perpetually
asked
advice
suffered
from
lumbago
doubted
his
nose
growingredder
and
redder
daily
whether
he
was
fit
for
his
post
and
by
alternate
mails
sent
in
and
withdrew
his
resignation
then
too
both
the
general
and
the
minister
suffered
acutely
from
that
distressingly
useful
new
invention
the
electric
telegraph
on
one
occasion
general
simpson
felt
obliged
actually
to
expostulate
think
my
lord
he
wrote
some
telegraphic
messages
reach
us
that
can
not
be
sent
under
due
authority
and
are
perhaps
unknown
to
you
although
under
the
protection
of
your
lordship
name
for
instance
i
was
called
up
last
night
a
dragoon
having
come
express
with
a
telegraphic
message
in
these
words
lord
panmure
to
general
simpson
captain
jarvis
has
been
bitten
by
a
centipede
how
is
he
now
general
simpson
might
have
put
up
with
this
though
to
be
sure
it
did
seem
too
trifling
an
affair
to
call
for
a
dragoon
to
ride
a
couple
of
miles
in
the
dark
that
he
may
knock
up
the
commander
of
the
army
out
of
the
very
small
allowance
of
sleep
permitted
but
what
was
really
more
than
he
could
bear
was
to
find
sending
in
the
morning
another
mounted
dragoon
to
inquire
after
captain
jarvis
four
miles
off
that
he
never
has
been
bitten
at
all
but
has
had
a
boil
from
which
he
is
fast
recovering
but
lord
panmure
had
troubles
of
his
own
his
favourite
nephew
captain
dowbiggin
was
at
the
front
and
to
one
of
his
telegrams
to
the
the
minister
had
taken
occasion
to
append
the
following
carefully
qualified
sentence
recommend
dowbiggin
to
your
notice
should
you
have
a
vacancy
and
if
he
is
fit
unfortunately
in
those
early
days
it
was
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
telegraphist
to
compress
the
messages
which
passed
through
his
hands
so
that
the
result
was
that
lord
panmure
delicate
appeal
reached
its
destination
in
the
laconic
form
of
after
dowb
the
headquarters
staff
were
at
first
extremely
puzzled
they
were
at
last
extremely
amused
the
story
spread
and
after
dowb
remained
for
many
years
the
familiar
formula
for
describing
official
hints
in
favour
of
deserving
nephews
and
now
that
all
this
was
over
now
that
sebastopol
had
been
somehow
or
another
taken
now
that
peace
was
somehow
or
another
made
now
that
the
troubles
of
office
might
surely
be
expected
to
be
at
an
end
at
last
here
was
miss
nightingale
breaking
in
upon
the
scene
with
her
talk
about
the
state
of
the
hospitals
and
the
necessity
for
sanitary
reform
it
was
most
irksome
and
lord
panmure
almost
began
to
wish
that
he
was
engaged
upon
some
more
congenial
occupation
discussing
perhaps
the
constitution
of
the
free
church
of
scotland
a
question
in
which
he
was
profoundly
interested
but
no
duty
was
paramount
and
he
set
himself
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
to
the
task
of
doing
as
little
of
it
as
he
possibly
could
bison
his
friends
called
him
and
the
name
fitted
both
his
physical
demeanour
and
his
habit
of
mind
that
large
low
head
seemed
to
have
been
created
for
butting
rather
than
for
anything
else
there
he
stood
and
menacing
in
the
doorway
of
reform
and
it
remained
to
be
seen
whether
the
bulky
mass
upon
whose
solid
hide
even
the
barbed
arrows
of
lord
raglan
scorn
had
made
no
mark
would
prove
amenable
to
the
pressure
of
miss
nightingale
nor
was
he
alone
in
the
doorway
there
loomed
behind
him
the
whole
phalanx
of
professional
conservatism
the
stubborn
supporters
of
the
the
worshippers
and
the
victims
of
war
office
routine
among
these
it
was
only
natural
that
andrew
smith
the
head
of
the
army
medical
department
should
have
been
andrew
smith
who
had
assured
miss
nightingale
before
she
left
england
that
was
wanted
at
scutari
such
were
her
opponents
but
she
too
was
not
without
allies
she
had
gained
the
ear
of
royalty
which
was
something
at
any
moment
that
she
pleased
she
could
gain
the
ear
of
the
public
which
was
a
great
deal
she
had
a
host
of
admirers
and
friends
and
to
say
nothing
of
her
personal
qualities
her
knowledge
her
tenacity
her
tact
she
possessed
too
one
advantage
which
then
far
more
even
than
now
carried
an
immense
weight
she
belonged
to
the
highest
circle
of
society
she
moved
naturally
among
peers
and
cabinet
ministers
she
was
one
of
their
own
set
and
in
those
days
their
set
was
a
very
narrow
one
what
kind
of
attention
would
such
persons
have
paid
to
some
woman
with
whom
they
were
not
acquainted
who
possessed
great
experience
of
army
nursing
and
had
decided
views
upon
hospital
reform
they
would
have
politely
ignored
her
but
it
was
impossible
to
ignore
flo
nightingale
when
she
spoke
they
were
obliged
to
listen
and
when
they
had
once
begun
to
do
that
what
might
not
follow
she
knew
her
power
and
she
used
it
she
supported
her
weightiest
minutes
with
familiar
witty
little
notes
the
bison
began
to
look
grave
it
might
be
difficult
it
might
be
damned
difficult
to
put
down
one
head
against
the
white
hand
of
a
lady
of
miss
nightingale
friends
the
most
important
was
sidney
herbert
he
was
a
man
upon
whom
the
good
fairies
seemed
to
have
showered
as
he
lay
in
his
cradle
all
their
most
enviable
goods
well
born
handsome
rich
the
master
of
wilton
one
of
those
great
clothed
with
the
glamour
of
a
historic
past
which
are
the
peculiar
glory
of
england
he
possessed
besides
all
these
advantages
so
charming
so
lively
so
gentle
a
disposition
that
no
one
who
had
once
come
near
him
could
ever
be
his
enemy
he
was
in
fact
a
man
of
whom
it
was
difficult
not
to
say
that
he
was
a
perfect
english
gentleman
for
his
virtues
were
equal
even
to
his
good
fortune
he
was
religious
deeply
religious
am
more
and
more
convinced
every
day
he
wrote
when
he
had
been
for
some
years
a
cabinet
minister
in
politics
as
in
everything
else
nothing
can
be
right
which
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
the
gospel
no
one
was
more
unselfish
he
was
charitable
and
benevolent
to
a
remarkable
degree
and
he
devoted
the
whole
of
his
life
with
an
unwavering
conscientiousness
to
the
public
service
with
such
a
character
with
such
opportunities
what
high
hopes
must
have
danced
before
him
what
radiant
visions
of
accomplished
duties
of
usefulness
of
beneficent
power
of
the
consciousness
of
disinterested
success
some
of
those
hopes
and
visions
were
indeed
realised
but
in
the
end
the
career
of
sidney
herbert
seemed
to
show
that
with
all
their
generosity
there
was
some
gift
or
other
what
was
it
some
essential
gift
which
the
good
fairies
had
withheld
and
that
even
the
qualities
of
a
perfect
english
gentleman
may
be
no
safeguard
against
anguish
humiliation
and
defeat
that
career
would
certainly
have
been
very
different
if
he
had
never
known
miss
nightingale
the
alliance
between
them
which
had
begun
with
her
appointment
to
scutari
which
had
grown
closer
and
closer
while
the
war
lasted
developed
after
her
return
into
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
friendships
it
was
the
friendship
of
a
man
and
a
woman
intimately
bound
together
by
their
devotion
to
a
public
cause
mutual
affection
of
course
played
a
part
in
it
but
it
was
an
incidental
part
the
whole
soul
of
the
relationship
was
a
community
of
work
perhaps
out
of
england
such
an
intimacy
could
hardly
have
existed
an
intimacy
so
utterly
untinctured
not
only
by
passion
itself
but
by
the
suspicion
of
it
for
years
sidney
herbert
saw
miss
nightingale
almost
daily
for
long
hours
together
corresponding
with
her
incessantly
when
they
were
apart
and
the
tongue
of
scandal
was
silent
and
one
of
the
most
devoted
of
her
admirers
was
his
wife
but
what
made
the
connection
still
more
remarkable
was
the
way
in
which
the
parts
that
were
played
in
it
were
divided
between
the
two
the
man
who
acts
decides
and
achieves
the
woman
who
encourages
applauds
and
from
a
distance
inspires
the
combination
is
common
enough
but
miss
nightingale
was
neither
an
aspasia
nor
an
egeria
in
her
case
it
is
almost
true
to
say
that
the
roles
were
reversed
the
qualities
of
pliancy
and
sympathy
fell
to
the
man
those
of
command
and
initiative
to
the
woman
there
was
one
thing
only
which
miss
nightingale
lacked
in
her
equipment
for
public
life
she
had
not
she
never
could
have
the
public
power
and
authority
which
belonged
to
the
successful
politician
that
power
and
authority
sidney
herbert
possessed
that
fact
was
obvious
and
the
conclusions
no
less
so
it
was
through
the
man
that
the
woman
must
work
her
will
she
took
hold
of
him
taught
him
shaped
him
absorbed
him
dominated
him
through
and
through
he
did
not
resist
he
did
not
wish
to
resist
his
natural
inclination
lay
along
the
same
path
as
hers
only
that
terrific
personality
swept
him
forward
at
her
own
fierce
pace
and
with
her
own
relentless
stride
swept
him
where
to
ah
why
had
he
ever
known
miss
nightingale
if
lord
panmure
was
a
bison
sidney
herbert
no
doubt
was
a
stag
a
comely
gallant
creature
springing
through
the
forest
but
the
forest
is
a
dangerous
place
one
has
the
image
of
those
wide
eyes
fascinated
suddenly
by
something
feline
something
strong
there
is
a
pause
and
then
the
tigress
has
her
claws
in
the
quivering
haunches
and
then
besides
sidney
herbert
she
had
other
friends
who
in
a
more
restricted
sphere
were
hardly
less
essential
to
her
if
in
her
condition
of
bodily
collapse
she
were
to
accomplish
what
she
was
determined
that
she
should
accomplish
the
attentions
and
the
services
of
others
would
be
absolutely
indispensable
helpers
and
servers
she
must
have
and
accordingly
there
was
soon
formed
about
her
a
little
group
of
devoted
disciples
upon
whose
affections
and
energies
she
could
implicitly
rely
devoted
indeed
these
disciples
were
in
no
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
for
certainly
she
was
no
light
taskmistress
and
he
who
set
out
to
be
of
use
to
miss
nightingale
was
apt
to
find
before
he
had
gone
very
far
that
he
was
in
truth
being
made
use
of
in
good
earnest
to
the
very
limit
of
his
endurance
and
his
capacity
perhaps
even
beyond
those
limits
why
not
was
she
asking
of
others
more
than
she
was
giving
herself
let
them
look
at
her
lying
there
pale
and
breathless
on
the
couch
could
it
be
said
that
she
spared
herself
why
then
should
she
spare
others
and
it
was
not
for
her
own
sake
that
she
made
these
claims
for
her
own
sake
indeed
no
they
all
knew
it
it
was
for
the
sake
of
the
work
and
so
the
little
band
bound
body
and
soul
in
that
strange
servitude
laboured
on
ungrudgingly
among
the
most
faithful
was
her
mai
her
father
sister
who
from
the
earliest
days
had
stood
beside
her
who
had
helped
her
to
escape
from
the
thraldom
of
family
life
who
had
been
with
her
at
scutari
and
who
now
acted
almost
the
part
of
a
mother
to
her
watching
over
her
with
infinite
care
in
all
the
movements
and
uncertainties
which
her
state
of
health
involved
another
constant
attendant
was
her
sir
harry
verney
whom
she
found
particularly
valuable
in
parliamentary
affairs
arthur
clough
the
poet
also
a
connection
by
marriage
she
used
in
other
ways
ever
since
he
had
lost
his
faith
at
the
time
of
the
oxford
movement
clough
had
passed
his
life
in
a
condition
of
considerable
uneasiness
which
was
increased
rather
than
diminished
by
the
practice
of
poetry
unable
to
decide
upon
the
purpose
of
an
existence
whose
savour
had
fled
together
with
his
belief
in
the
resurrection
his
spirits
lowered
still
further
by
and
his
income
not
all
that
it
should
be
he
had
determined
to
seek
the
solution
of
his
difficulties
in
the
united
states
of
america
but
even
there
the
solution
was
not
forthcoming
and
when
a
little
later
he
was
offered
a
post
in
a
government
department
at
home
he
accepted
it
came
to
live
in
london
and
immediately
fell
under
the
influence
of
miss
nightingale
though
the
purpose
of
existence
might
be
still
uncertain
and
its
nature
still
unsavoury
here
at
any
rate
under
the
eye
of
this
inspired
woman
was
something
real
something
earnest
his
only
doubt
was
could
he
be
of
any
use
certainly
he
could
there
were
a
great
number
of
miscellaneous
little
jobs
which
there
was
nobody
handy
to
do
for
instance
when
miss
nightingale
was
travelling
there
were
the
to
be
taken
and
there
were
to
be
corrected
and
then
there
were
parcels
to
be
done
up
in
brown
paper
and
carried
to
the
post
certainly
he
could
be
useful
and
so
upon
such
occupations
as
these
arthur
clough
was
set
to
work
that
i
see
is
not
all
he
comforted
himself
by
reflecting
this
that
i
do
is
but
little
nevertheless
it
is
good
though
there
is
better
than
it
as
time
went
on
her
as
she
called
it
grew
larger
officials
with
whom
her
work
brought
her
into
touch
and
who
sympathised
with
her
objects
were
pressed
into
her
service
and
old
friends
of
the
crimean
days
gathered
around
her
when
they
returned
to
england
among
these
the
most
indefatigable
was
sutherland
a
sanitary
expert
who
for
more
than
thirty
years
acted
as
her
confidential
private
secretary
and
surrendered
to
her
purposes
literally
the
whole
of
his
life
thus
sustained
and
assisted
thus
slaved
for
and
adored
she
prepared
to
beard
the
bison
two
facts
soon
emerged
and
all
that
followed
turned
upon
them
it
became
clear
in
the
first
place
that
that
imposing
mass
was
not
immovable
and
in
the
second
that
its
movement
when
it
did
move
would
be
exceeding
slow
the
bison
was
no
match
for
the
lady
it
was
in
vain
that
he
put
down
his
head
and
planted
his
feet
in
the
earth
he
could
not
withstand
her
the
white
hand
forced
him
back
but
the
process
was
an
extraordinarily
gradual
one
andrew
smith
and
all
his
war
office
phalanx
stood
behind
blocking
the
way
the
poor
bison
groaned
inwardly
and
cast
a
wistful
eye
towards
the
happy
pastures
of
the
free
church
of
scotland
then
slowly
with
infinite
reluctance
step
by
step
he
retreated
disputing
every
inch
of
the
ground
the
first
great
measure
which
supported
as
it
was
by
the
queen
the
cabinet
and
the
united
opinion
of
the
country
it
was
impossible
to
resist
was
the
appointment
of
a
royal
commission
to
report
upon
the
health
of
the
army
the
question
of
the
composition
of
the
commission
then
immediately
arose
and
it
was
over
this
matter
that
the
first
encounter
between
lord
panmure
and
miss
nightingale
took
place
they
met
and
miss
nightingale
was
victorious
sidney
herbert
was
appointed
chairman
and
in
the
end
the
only
member
of
the
commission
opposed
to
her
views
was
andrew
smith
during
the
interview
miss
nightingale
made
an
important
discovery
she
found
that
bison
was
bullyable
the
hide
was
the
hide
of
a
mexican
buffalo
but
the
spirit
was
the
spirit
of
an
alderney
calf
and
there
was
one
thing
above
all
others
which
the
huge
creature
dreaded
an
appeal
to
public
opinion
the
faintest
hint
of
such
a
terrible
eventuality
made
his
heart
dissolve
within
him
he
would
agree
to
anything
he
would
cut
short
his
he
would
make
a
speech
in
the
house
of
lords
he
would
even
overrule
andrew
smith
rather
than
that
miss
nightingale
held
the
fearful
threat
in
reserve
she
would
speak
out
what
she
knew
she
would
publish
the
truth
to
the
whole
world
and
let
the
whole
world
judge
between
them
with
supreme
skill
she
kept
this
sword
of
damocles
poised
above
the
bison
head
and
more
than
once
she
was
actually
on
the
point
of
really
dropping
it
for
his
recalcitrancy
grew
and
grew
the
personnel
of
the
commission
once
determined
upon
there
was
a
struggle
which
lasted
for
six
months
over
the
nature
of
its
powers
was
it
to
be
an
efficient
body
armed
with
the
right
of
full
inquiry
and
wide
examination
or
was
it
to
be
a
polite
official
contrivance
for
exonerating
andrew
smith
the
war
office
phalanx
closed
its
ranks
and
fought
tooth
and
nail
but
it
was
defeated
the
bison
was
bullyable
months
from
this
day
miss
nightingale
had
written
at
last
publish
my
experience
of
the
crimean
campaign
and
my
suggestions
for
improvement
unless
there
has
been
a
fair
and
tangible
pledge
by
that
time
for
reform
who
could
face
that
and
if
the
need
came
she
meant
to
be
as
good
as
her
word
for
she
had
now
determined
whatever
might
be
the
fate
of
the
commission
to
draw
up
her
own
report
upon
the
questions
at
issue
the
labour
involved
was
enormous
her
health
was
almost
desperate
but
she
did
not
flinch
and
after
six
months
of
incredible
industry
she
had
put
together
and
written
with
her
own
hand
her
notes
affecting
the
health
efficiency
and
hospital
administration
of
the
british
army
this
extraordinary
composition
filling
more
than
closely
printed
pages
laying
down
vast
principles
of
reform
discussing
the
minutest
details
of
a
multitude
of
controversial
subjects
containing
an
enormous
mass
of
information
of
the
most
varied
kinds
military
statistical
sanitary
architectural
was
never
given
to
the
public
for
the
need
never
came
but
it
formed
the
basis
of
the
report
of
the
royal
commission
and
it
remains
to
this
day
the
leading
authority
on
the
medical
administration
of
armies
before
it
had
been
completed
the
struggle
over
the
powers
of
the
commission
had
been
brought
to
a
victorious
close
lord
panmure
had
given
way
once
more
he
had
immediately
hurried
to
the
queen
to
obtain
her
consent
and
only
then
when
her
majesty
initials
had
been
irrevocably
affixed
to
the
fatal
document
did
he
dare
to
tell
andrew
smith
what
he
had
done
the
commission
met
and
another
immense
load
fell
upon
miss
nightingale
shoulders
today
she
would
of
course
have
been
one
of
the
commission
herself
but
at
that
time
the
idea
of
a
woman
appearing
in
such
a
capacity
was
unheard
of
and
no
one
even
suggested
the
possibility
of
miss
nightingale
doing
so
the
result
was
that
she
was
obliged
to
remain
behind
the
scenes
throughout
to
coach
sidney
herbert
in
private
at
every
important
juncture
and
to
convey
to
him
and
to
her
other
friends
upon
the
commission
the
vast
funds
of
her
expert
knowledge
so
essential
in
the
examination
of
witnesses
by
means
of
innumerable
consultations
letters
and
memoranda
it
was
even
doubtful
whether
the
proprieties
would
admit
of
her
giving
evidence
and
at
last
as
a
compromise
her
modesty
only
allowed
her
to
do
so
in
the
form
of
written
answers
to
written
questions
at
length
the
grand
affair
was
finished
the
commission
report
embodying
almost
word
for
word
the
suggestions
of
miss
nightingale
was
drawn
up
by
sidney
herbert
only
one
question
remained
to
be
answered
would
anything
after
all
be
done
or
would
the
royal
commission
like
so
many
other
royal
commissions
before
and
since
turn
out
to
have
achieved
nothing
but
the
concoction
of
a
very
fat
bluebook
on
a
very
high
shelf
and
so
the
last
and
the
deadliest
struggle
with
the
bison
began
six
months
had
been
spent
in
coercing
him
into
granting
the
commission
effective
powers
six
more
months
were
occupied
by
the
work
of
the
commission
and
now
yet
another
six
were
to
pass
in
extorting
from
him
the
means
whereby
the
recommendations
of
the
commission
might
be
actually
carried
out
but
in
the
end
the
thing
was
done
miss
nightingale
seemed
indeed
during
these
months
to
be
upon
the
very
brink
of
death
accompanied
by
the
faithful
aunt
mai
she
moved
from
place
to
place
to
hampstead
to
highgate
to
derbyshire
to
malvern
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
last
desperate
effort
to
find
health
somewhere
but
she
carried
that
with
her
which
made
health
impossible
her
desire
for
work
could
now
scarcely
be
distinguished
from
mania
at
one
moment
she
was
writing
a
letter
to
sidney
herbert
at
the
next
she
was
offering
to
go
out
to
india
to
nurse
the
sufferers
in
the
mutiny
when
sutherland
wrote
imploring
her
to
take
a
holiday
she
raved
rest
am
lying
without
my
head
without
my
claws
and
you
all
peck
at
me
it
is
de
rigueur
like
the
saying
something
to
one
hat
when
one
goes
into
church
to
say
to
me
all
that
has
been
said
to
me
times
a
day
during
the
last
three
months
it
is
the
obbligato
on
the
violin
and
the
twelve
violins
all
practise
it
together
like
the
clocks
striking
twelve
at
night
all
over
london
till
i
say
like
xavier
de
maistre
assez
je
sais
je
ne
le
sais
que
trop
i
am
not
a
penitent
but
you
are
like
the
confessor
who
says
what
is
de
rigueur
her
wits
began
to
turn
and
there
was
no
holding
her
she
worked
like
a
slave
in
a
mine
she
began
to
believe
as
she
had
begun
to
believe
at
scutari
that
none
of
her
had
their
hearts
in
the
business
if
they
had
why
did
they
not
work
as
she
did
she
could
only
see
slackness
and
stupidity
around
her
sutherland
of
course
was
grotesquely
and
arthur
clough
incurably
lazy
even
sidney
herbert
oh
yes
he
had
simplicity
and
candour
and
quickness
of
perception
no
doubt
but
he
was
an
eclectic
and
what
could
one
hope
for
from
a
man
who
went
away
to
fish
in
ireland
just
when
the
bison
most
needed
bullying
as
for
the
bison
himself
he
had
fled
to
scotland
where
he
remained
buried
for
many
months
the
fate
of
the
vital
recommendation
in
the
commission
report
the
appointment
of
four
charged
with
the
duty
of
determining
upon
the
details
of
the
proposed
reforms
and
of
putting
them
into
execution
still
hung
in
the
balance
the
bison
consented
to
everything
and
then
on
a
flying
visit
to
london
withdrew
his
consent
and
hastily
returned
to
scotland
then
for
many
weeks
all
business
was
suspended
he
had
gout
gout
in
the
hands
so
that
he
could
not
write
gout
was
always
handy
remarked
miss
nightingale
but
eventually
it
was
clear
even
to
the
bison
that
the
game
was
up
and
the
inevitable
surrender
came
there
was
however
one
point
in
which
he
triumphed
over
miss
nightingale
the
building
of
netley
hospital
had
been
begun
under
his
orders
before
her
return
to
england
soon
after
her
arrival
she
examined
the
plans
and
found
that
they
reproduced
all
the
worst
faults
of
an
and
mischievous
system
of
hospital
construction
she
therefore
urged
that
the
matter
should
be
reconsidered
and
in
the
meantime
the
building
stopped
but
the
bison
was
obdurate
it
would
be
very
expensive
and
in
any
case
it
was
too
late
unable
to
make
any
impression
on
him
and
convinced
of
the
extreme
importance
of
the
question
she
determined
to
appeal
to
a
higher
authority
lord
palmerston
was
prime
minister
she
had
known
him
from
her
childhood
he
was
a
near
neighbour
of
her
father
in
the
new
forest
she
went
down
to
the
new
forest
armed
with
the
plan
of
the
proposed
hospital
and
all
the
relevant
information
stayed
the
night
at
lord
palmerston
house
and
convinced
him
of
the
necessity
of
rebuilding
netley
seems
to
me
lord
palmerston
wrote
to
lord
panmure
at
netley
all
consideration
of
what
would
best
tend
to
the
comfort
and
recovery
of
the
patients
has
been
sacrificed
to
the
vanity
of
the
architect
whose
sole
object
has
been
to
make
a
building
which
should
cut
a
dash
when
looked
at
from
the
southampton
river
pray
therefore
stop
all
further
progress
in
the
work
until
the
matter
can
be
duly
considered
but
the
bison
was
not
to
be
moved
by
one
peremptory
letter
even
if
it
was
from
the
prime
minister
he
put
forth
all
his
powers
of
procrastination
lord
palmerston
lost
interest
in
the
subject
and
so
the
chief
military
hospital
in
england
was
triumphantly
completed
on
insanitary
principles
with
unventilated
rooms
and
with
all
the
patients
windows
facing
northeast
but
now
the
time
had
come
when
the
bison
was
to
trouble
and
to
be
troubled
no
more
a
vote
in
the
house
of
commons
brought
about
the
fall
of
lord
palmerston
government
and
lord
panmure
found
himself
at
liberty
to
devote
the
rest
of
his
life
to
the
free
church
of
scotland
after
a
brief
interval
sidney
herbert
became
secretary
of
state
for
war
great
was
the
jubilation
in
the
nightingale
cabinet
the
day
of
achievement
had
dawned
at
last
the
next
two
and
a
half
years
saw
the
introduction
of
the
whole
system
of
reforms
for
which
miss
nightingale
had
been
struggling
so
fiercely
reforms
which
make
sidney
herbert
tenure
of
power
at
the
war
office
an
important
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
british
army
the
four
firmly
established
under
the
immediate
control
of
the
minister
and
urged
forward
by
the
relentless
perseverance
of
miss
nightingale
set
to
work
with
a
will
the
barracks
and
the
hospitals
were
remodelled
they
were
properly
ventilated
and
warmed
and
lighted
for
the
first
time
they
were
given
a
water
supply
which
actually
supplied
water
and
kitchens
where
strange
to
say
it
was
possible
to
cook
then
the
great
question
of
the
purveyor
that
portentous
functionary
whose
powers
and
whose
lack
of
powers
had
weighed
like
a
nightmare
upon
scutari
was
taken
in
hand
and
new
regulations
were
laid
down
accurately
defining
his
responsibilities
and
his
duties
one
reorganised
the
medical
statistics
of
the
army
another
established
in
spite
of
the
last
convulsive
efforts
of
the
department
an
army
medical
school
finally
the
army
medical
department
itself
was
completely
reorganised
an
administrative
code
was
drawn
up
and
the
great
and
novel
principle
was
established
that
it
was
as
much
a
part
of
the
duty
of
the
authorities
to
look
after
the
soldier
health
as
to
look
after
his
sickness
besides
this
it
was
at
last
officially
admitted
that
he
had
a
moral
and
intellectual
side
and
gymnasiums
and
workshops
were
instituted
a
new
era
did
in
truth
appear
to
have
begun
already
by
the
mortality
in
the
army
had
decreased
by
since
the
days
of
the
crimea
it
was
no
wonder
that
even
vaster
possibilities
began
now
to
open
out
before
miss
nightingale
one
thing
was
still
needed
to
complete
and
to
assure
her
triumphs
the
army
medical
department
was
indeed
reorganised
but
the
great
central
machine
was
still
untouched
the
war
office
itself
if
she
could
remould
that
nearer
to
her
desire
there
indeed
would
be
a
victory
and
until
that
final
act
was
accomplished
how
could
she
be
certain
that
all
the
rest
of
her
achievements
might
not
by
some
capricious
turn
of
fortune
wheel
a
change
of
ministry
perhaps
replacing
sidney
herbert
by
some
puppet
of
the
permanent
official
gang
be
swept
to
limbo
in
a
moment
meanwhile
still
ravenous
for
yet
more
and
more
work
her
activities
had
branched
out
into
new
directions
the
army
in
india
claimed
her
attention
a
sanitary
commission
appointed
at
her
suggestion
and
working
under
her
auspices
did
for
our
troops
there
what
the
four
were
doing
for
those
at
home
at
the
same
time
these
very
years
which
saw
her
laying
the
foundations
of
the
whole
modern
system
of
medical
work
in
the
army
saw
her
also
beginning
to
bring
her
knowledge
her
influence
and
her
activity
into
the
service
of
the
country
at
large
her
notes
on
hospitals
revolutionised
the
theory
of
hospital
construction
and
hospital
management
she
was
immediately
recognised
as
the
leading
expert
upon
all
the
questions
involved
her
advice
flowed
unceasingly
and
in
all
directions
so
that
there
is
no
great
hospital
today
which
does
not
bear
upon
it
the
impress
of
her
mind
nor
was
this
all
with
the
opening
of
the
nightingale
training
school
for
nurses
at
thomas
hospital
she
became
the
founder
of
modern
nursing
but
a
terrible
crisis
was
now
fast
approaching
sidney
herbert
had
consented
to
undertake
the
root
and
branch
reform
of
the
war
office
he
had
sallied
forth
into
that
tropical
jungle
of
festooned
obstructiveness
of
intertwisted
irresponsibilities
of
crouching
prejudices
of
abuses
grown
stiff
and
rigid
with
antiquity
which
for
so
many
years
to
come
was
destined
to
lure
reforming
ministers
to
their
doom
war
office
said
miss
nightingale
a
very
slow
office
an
enormously
expensive
office
and
one
in
which
the
minister
intentions
can
be
entirely
negated
by
all
his
and
those
of
each
of
the
by
every
other
it
was
true
and
of
course
at
the
first
rumour
of
a
change
the
old
phalanx
of
reaction
was
bristling
with
its
accustomed
spears
at
its
head
stood
no
longer
andrew
smith
who
some
time
since
had
followed
the
bison
into
outer
darkness
but
a
yet
more
formidable
figure
the
permanent
himself
sir
benjamin
hawes
ben
hawes
the
nightingale
cabinet
irreverently
dubbed
him
man
remarkable
even
among
civil
servants
for
adroitness
in
baffling
inconvenient
inquiries
resource
in
raising
false
issues
and
in
short
a
consummate
command
of
all
the
arts
of
officially
sticking
in
the
mud
scheme
will
probably
result
in
ben
hawes
resignation
miss
nightingale
said
that
is
another
of
its
advantages
ben
hawes
himself
however
did
not
quite
see
it
in
that
light
he
set
himself
to
resist
the
wishes
of
the
minister
by
every
means
in
his
power
the
struggle
was
long
and
desperate
and
as
it
proceeded
it
gradually
became
evident
to
miss
nightingale
that
something
was
the
matter
with
sidney
herbert
what
was
it
his
health
never
very
strong
was
he
said
in
danger
of
collapsing
under
the
strain
of
his
work
but
after
all
what
is
illness
when
there
is
a
war
office
to
be
reorganised
then
he
began
to
talk
of
retiring
altogether
from
public
life
the
doctors
were
consulted
and
declared
that
above
all
things
what
was
necessary
was
rest
rest
she
grew
seriously
alarmed
was
it
possible
that
at
the
last
moment
the
crowning
wreath
of
victory
was
to
be
snatched
from
her
grasp
she
was
not
to
be
put
aside
by
doctors
they
were
talking
nonsense
the
necessary
thing
was
not
rest
but
the
reform
of
the
war
office
and
besides
she
knew
very
well
from
her
own
case
what
one
could
do
even
when
one
was
on
the
point
of
death
she
expostulated
vehemently
passionately
the
goal
was
so
near
so
very
near
he
could
not
turn
back
now
at
any
rate
he
could
not
resist
miss
nightingale
a
compromise
was
arranged
very
reluctantly
he
exchanged
the
turmoil
of
the
house
of
commons
for
the
dignity
of
the
house
of
lords
and
he
remained
at
the
war
office
she
was
delighted
fight
more
the
best
and
the
last
she
said
for
several
more
months
the
fight
did
indeed
go
on
but
the
strain
upon
him
was
greater
even
than
she
perhaps
could
realise
besides
the
intestine
war
in
his
office
he
had
to
face
a
constant
battle
in
the
cabinet
with
gladstone
a
more
redoubtable
antagonist
even
than
ben
hawes
over
the
estimates
his
health
grew
worse
and
worse
he
was
attacked
by
and
there
were
some
days
when
he
could
only
just
keep
himself
going
by
gulps
of
brandy
miss
nightingale
spurred
him
forward
with
her
encouragements
and
her
admonitions
her
zeal
and
her
example
but
at
last
his
spirit
began
to
sink
as
well
as
his
body
he
could
no
longer
hope
he
could
no
longer
desire
it
was
useless
all
useless
it
was
utterly
impossible
he
had
failed
the
dreadful
moment
came
when
the
truth
was
forced
upon
him
he
would
never
be
able
to
reform
the
war
office
but
a
yet
more
dreadful
moment
lay
behind
he
must
go
to
miss
nightingale
and
tell
her
that
he
was
a
failure
a
beaten
man
are
the
merciful
what
strange
ironic
prescience
had
led
prince
albert
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
to
choose
that
motto
for
the
crimean
brooch
the
words
hold
a
double
lesson
and
alas
when
she
brought
herself
to
realise
at
length
what
was
indeed
the
fact
and
what
there
was
no
helping
it
was
not
in
mercy
that
she
turned
upon
her
old
friend
she
exclaimed
you
see
that
you
simply
thrown
away
the
game
and
with
all
the
winning
cards
in
your
hands
and
so
noble
a
game
sidney
herbert
beaten
and
beaten
by
ben
hawes
it
is
a
worse
disgrace
her
full
rage
burst
out
at
last
a
worse
disgrace
than
the
hospitals
at
scutari
he
dragged
himself
away
from
her
dragged
himself
to
spa
hoping
vainly
for
a
return
to
health
and
then
despairing
back
again
to
england
to
wilton
to
the
majestic
house
standing
there
resplendent
in
the
summer
sunshine
among
the
great
cedars
which
had
lent
their
shade
to
sir
philip
sidney
and
all
those
familiar
darling
haunts
of
beauty
which
he
loved
each
one
of
them
if
they
were
persons
and
at
wilton
he
died
after
having
received
the
eucharist
he
had
become
perfectly
calm
then
almost
unconscious
his
lips
were
seen
to
be
moving
those
about
him
bent
down
florence
poor
florence
they
just
caught
our
joint
work
unfinished
tried
to
do
and
they
could
hear
no
more
when
the
onward
rush
of
a
powerful
spirit
sweeps
a
weaker
one
to
its
destruction
the
commonplaces
of
the
moral
judgment
are
better
left
unmade
if
miss
nightingale
had
been
less
ruthless
sidney
herbert
would
not
have
perished
but
then
she
would
not
have
been
miss
nightingale
the
force
that
created
was
the
force
that
destroyed
it
was
her
demon
that
was
responsible
when
the
fatal
news
reached
her
she
was
overcome
by
agony
in
the
revulsion
of
her
feelings
she
made
a
worship
of
the
dead
man
memory
and
the
facile
instrument
which
had
broken
in
her
hand
she
spoke
of
forever
after
as
her
then
almost
at
the
same
moment
another
blow
fell
on
her
arthur
clough
worn
out
by
labours
very
different
from
those
of
sidney
herbert
died
too
never
more
would
he
tie
up
her
parcels
and
yet
a
third
disaster
followed
the
faithful
aunt
mai
did
not
to
be
sure
die
no
she
did
something
almost
worse
she
left
miss
nightingale
she
was
growing
old
and
she
felt
that
she
had
closer
and
more
imperative
duties
with
her
own
family
her
niece
could
hardly
forgive
her
she
poured
out
in
one
of
her
enormous
letters
a
passionate
diatribe
upon
the
faithlessness
the
lack
of
sympathy
the
stupidity
the
ineptitude
of
women
her
doctrines
had
taken
no
hold
among
them
she
had
never
known
one
who
had
appris
a
apprendre
she
could
not
even
get
a
woman
secretary
do
know
the
names
of
the
cabinet
ministers
they
do
know
which
of
the
churches
has
bishops
and
which
not
as
for
the
spirit
of
well
sidney
herbert
and
arthur
clough
were
men
and
they
indeed
had
shown
their
devotion
but
women
she
would
mount
three
widow
caps
a
sign
the
first
two
would
be
for
clough
and
for
her
master
but
the
third
biggest
widow
cap
of
all
would
be
for
aunt
mai
she
did
well
to
be
angry
she
was
deserted
in
her
hour
of
need
and
after
all
could
she
be
sure
that
even
the
male
sex
was
so
impeccable
there
was
sutherland
bungling
as
usual
perhaps
even
he
intended
to
go
off
one
of
these
days
too
she
gave
him
a
look
and
he
shivered
in
his
shoes
no
she
grinned
sardonically
she
would
always
have
sutherland
and
then
she
reflected
that
there
was
one
thing
more
that
she
would
always
have
her
work
iv
sidney
herbert
death
finally
put
an
end
to
miss
nightingale
dream
of
a
reformed
war
office
for
a
moment
indeed
in
the
first
agony
of
her
disappointment
she
had
wildly
clutched
at
a
straw
she
had
written
to
gladstone
to
beg
him
to
take
up
the
burden
of
sidney
herbert
work
and
gladstone
had
replied
with
a
sympathetic
account
of
the
funeral
succeeding
secretaries
of
state
managed
between
them
to
undo
a
good
deal
of
what
had
been
accomplished
but
they
could
not
undo
it
all
and
for
ten
years
more
miss
nightingale
remained
a
potent
influence
at
the
war
office
after
that
her
direct
connection
with
the
army
came
to
an
end
and
her
energies
began
to
turn
more
and
more
completely
towards
more
general
objects
her
work
upon
hospital
reform
assumed
enormous
proportions
she
was
able
to
improve
the
conditions
in
infirmaries
and
workhouses
and
one
of
her
most
remarkable
papers
forestalls
the
recommendations
of
the
poor
law
commission
of
her
training
school
for
nurses
with
all
that
it
involved
in
initiative
control
responsibillity
and
combat
would
have
been
enough
in
itself
to
have
absorbed
the
whole
efforts
of
at
least
two
lives
of
ordinary
vigour
and
at
the
same
time
her
work
in
connection
with
india
which
had
begun
with
the
sanitary
commission
on
the
indian
army
spread
and
ramified
in
a
multitude
of
directions
her
tentacles
reached
the
india
office
and
succeeded
in
establishing
a
hold
even
upon
those
slippery
high
places
for
many
years
it
was
de
rigueur
for
the
newly
appointed
viceroy
before
he
left
england
to
pay
a
visit
to
miss
nightingale
after
much
hesitation
she
had
settled
down
in
a
small
house
in
south
street
where
she
remained
for
the
rest
of
her
life
that
life
was
a
very
long
one
the
dying
woman
reached
her
year
her
ill
health
gradually
diminished
the
crises
of
extreme
danger
became
less
frequent
and
at
last
altogether
ceased
she
remained
an
invalid
but
an
invalid
of
a
curious
character
an
invalid
who
was
too
weak
to
walk
downstairs
and
who
worked
far
harder
than
most
cabinet
ministers
her
illness
whatever
it
may
have
been
was
certainly
not
inconvenient
it
involved
seclusion
and
an
extraordinary
an
unparalleled
seclusion
was
it
might
almost
have
been
said
the
mainspring
of
miss
life
lying
on
her
sofa
in
the
little
upper
room
in
south
street
she
combined
the
intense
vitality
of
a
dominating
woman
of
the
world
with
the
mysterious
and
romantic
quality
of
a
myth
she
was
a
legend
in
her
lifetime
and
she
knew
it
she
tasted
the
joys
of
power
like
those
eastern
emperors
whose
autocratic
rule
was
based
upon
invisibility
with
the
mingled
satisfactions
of
obscurity
and
fame
and
she
found
the
machinery
of
illness
hardly
less
effective
as
a
barrier
against
the
eyes
of
men
than
the
ceremonial
of
a
palace
great
statesmen
and
renowned
generals
were
obliged
to
beg
for
audiences
admiring
princesses
from
foreign
countries
found
that
they
must
see
her
at
her
own
time
or
not
at
all
and
the
ordinary
mortal
had
no
hope
of
ever
getting
beyond
the
downstairs
and
sutherland
for
that
indefatigable
disciple
did
indeed
never
desert
her
he
might
be
impatient
he
might
be
restless
but
he
remained
his
looseness
of
thought
for
so
she
termed
it
continued
at
her
service
to
the
end
once
it
is
true
he
had
actually
ventured
to
take
a
holiday
but
he
was
recalled
and
he
did
not
repeat
the
experiment
he
was
wanted
downstairs
there
he
sat
transacting
business
answering
correspondence
interviewing
callers
and
exchanging
innumerable
notes
with
the
unseen
power
above
sometimes
word
came
down
that
miss
nightingale
was
just
well
enough
to
see
one
of
her
visitors
the
fortunate
man
was
led
up
was
ushered
trembling
into
the
shaded
chamber
and
of
course
could
never
afterwards
forget
the
interview
very
rarely
indeed
once
or
twice
a
year
perhaps
but
nobody
could
be
quite
certain
in
deadly
secrecy
miss
nightingale
went
out
for
a
drive
in
the
park
unrecognised
the
living
legend
flitted
for
a
moment
before
the
common
gaze
and
the
precaution
was
necessary
for
there
were
times
when
at
some
public
function
the
rumour
of
her
presence
was
spread
abroad
and
ladies
mistaken
by
the
crowd
for
miss
nightingale
were
followed
pressed
upon
vehemently
supplicated
me
touch
your
shawl
me
stroke
your
arm
such
was
the
strange
adoration
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
that
vast
reserve
of
force
lay
there
behind
her
she
could
use
it
if
she
could
but
she
preferred
never
to
use
it
on
occasions
she
might
hint
or
threaten
she
might
balance
the
sword
of
damocles
over
the
head
of
the
bison
she
might
by
a
word
by
a
glance
remind
some
refractory
minister
some
unpersuadable
viceroy
sitting
in
audience
with
her
in
the
little
upper
room
that
she
was
something
more
than
a
mere
sick
woman
that
she
had
only
so
to
speak
to
go
to
the
window
and
wave
her
handkerchief
for
dreadful
things
to
follow
but
that
was
enough
they
understood
the
myth
was
there
obvious
portentous
impalpable
and
so
it
remained
to
the
last
with
statesmen
and
governors
at
her
beck
and
call
with
her
hands
on
a
hundred
strings
with
mighty
provinces
at
her
feet
with
foreign
governments
agog
for
her
counsel
building
hospitals
training
nurses
she
still
felt
that
she
had
not
enough
to
do
she
sighed
for
more
worlds
to
conquer
more
and
yet
more
she
looked
about
her
what
was
left
of
course
philosophy
after
the
world
of
action
the
world
of
thought
having
set
right
the
health
of
the
british
army
she
would
now
do
the
same
good
service
for
the
religious
convictions
of
mankind
she
had
long
noticed
with
regret
the
growing
tendency
towards
among
artisans
with
regret
but
not
altogether
with
surprise
the
current
teaching
of
christianity
was
sadly
to
seek
nay
christianity
itself
was
not
without
its
defects
she
would
rectify
these
errors
she
would
correct
the
mistakes
of
the
churches
she
would
point
out
just
where
christianity
was
wrong
and
she
would
explain
to
the
artisans
what
the
facts
of
the
case
really
were
before
her
departure
for
the
crimea
she
had
begun
this
work
and
now
in
the
intervals
of
her
other
labours
she
completed
it
her
for
thought
to
the
searchers
after
truth
among
the
artisans
of
england
unravels
in
the
course
of
three
portly
volumes
the
difficulties
hitherto
curiously
enough
unsolved
connected
with
such
matters
as
belief
in
god
the
plan
of
creation
the
origin
of
evil
the
future
life
necessity
and
free
will
law
and
the
nature
of
morality
the
origin
of
evil
in
particular
held
no
perplexities
for
miss
nightingale
can
not
conceive
she
remarks
omnipotent
righteousness
would
find
satisfaction
in
solitary
existence
this
being
so
the
only
question
remaining
to
be
asked
is
beings
should
we
then
conceive
that
god
would
create
now
he
can
not
create
perfect
beings
essentially
perfection
is
one
if
he
did
so
he
would
only
be
adding
to
himself
thus
the
conclusion
is
obvious
he
must
create
imperfect
ones
omnipotent
righteousness
faced
by
the
intolerable
impasse
of
a
solitary
existence
finds
itself
bound
by
the
very
nature
of
the
cause
to
create
the
hospitals
at
scutari
whether
this
argument
would
have
satisfied
the
artisans
was
never
discovered
for
only
a
very
few
copies
of
the
book
were
printed
for
private
circulation
one
copy
was
sent
to
mill
who
acknowledged
it
in
an
extremely
polite
letter
he
felt
himself
obliged
however
to
confess
that
he
had
not
been
altogether
convinced
by
miss
nightingale
proof
of
the
existence
of
god
miss
nightingale
was
surprised
and
mortified
she
had
thought
better
of
mill
for
surely
her
proof
of
the
existence
of
god
could
hardly
be
improved
upon
law
she
had
pointed
out
a
now
the
universe
is
full
of
laws
the
law
of
gravitation
the
law
of
the
excluded
middle
and
many
others
hence
it
follows
that
the
universe
has
a
and
what
would
mill
be
satisfied
with
if
he
was
not
satisfied
with
that
perhaps
mill
might
have
asked
why
the
argument
had
not
been
pushed
to
its
logical
conclusion
clearly
if
we
are
to
trust
the
analogy
of
human
institutions
we
must
remember
that
laws
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
not
dispensed
by
lawgivers
but
passed
by
act
of
parliament
miss
nightingale
however
with
all
her
experience
of
public
life
never
stopped
to
consider
the
question
whether
god
might
not
be
a
limited
monarchy
yet
her
conception
of
god
was
certainly
not
orthodox
she
felt
towards
him
as
she
might
have
felt
towards
a
glorified
sanitary
engineer
and
in
some
of
her
speculations
she
seems
hardly
to
distinguish
between
the
deity
and
the
drains
as
one
turns
over
these
singular
pages
one
has
the
impression
that
miss
nightingale
has
got
the
almighty
too
into
her
clutches
and
that
if
he
is
not
careful
she
will
kill
him
with
overwork
then
suddenly
in
the
very
midst
of
the
ramifying
generalities
of
her
metaphysical
disquisitions
there
is
an
unexpected
turn
and
the
reader
is
plunged
all
at
once
into
something
particular
something
personal
something
impregnated
with
intense
experience
a
virulent
invective
upon
the
position
of
women
in
the
upper
ranks
of
society
forgetful
alike
of
her
high
argument
and
of
the
artisans
the
bitter
creature
rails
through
a
hundred
pages
of
close
print
at
the
falsities
of
family
life
the
ineptitudes
of
marriage
the
emptinesses
of
convention
in
the
spirit
of
an
ibsen
or
a
samuel
butler
her
fierce
pen
shaking
with
intimate
anger
depicts
in
biting
sentences
the
fearful
fate
of
an
unmarried
girl
in
a
wealthy
household
it
is
a
cri
du
coeur
and
then
as
suddenly
she
returns
once
more
to
instruct
the
artisans
upon
the
nature
of
omnipotent
righteousness
her
mind
was
indeed
better
qualified
to
dissect
the
concrete
and
distasteful
fruits
of
actual
life
than
to
construct
a
coherent
system
of
abstract
philosophy
in
spite
of
her
respect
for
law
she
was
never
at
home
with
a
generalisation
thus
though
the
great
achievement
of
her
life
lay
in
the
immense
impetus
which
she
gave
to
the
scientific
treatment
of
sickness
a
true
comprehension
of
the
scientific
method
itself
was
alien
to
her
spirit
like
most
great
men
of
action
perhaps
like
all
she
was
simply
an
empiricist
she
believed
in
what
she
saw
and
she
acted
accordingly
beyond
that
she
would
not
go
she
had
found
in
scutari
that
fresh
air
and
light
played
an
effective
part
in
the
prevention
of
the
maladies
with
which
she
had
to
deal
and
that
was
enough
for
her
she
would
not
inquire
further
what
were
the
general
principles
underlying
that
fact
or
even
whether
there
were
any
she
refused
to
consider
years
after
the
discoveries
of
pasteur
and
lister
she
laughed
at
what
she
called
the
there
was
no
such
thing
as
she
had
never
seen
it
therefore
it
did
not
exist
but
she
had
seen
the
good
effects
of
fresh
air
therefore
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
them
and
therefore
it
was
essential
that
the
bedrooms
of
patients
should
be
well
ventilated
such
was
her
doctrine
and
in
those
days
of
hermetically
scaled
windows
it
was
a
very
valuable
one
but
it
was
a
purely
empirical
doctrine
and
thus
it
led
to
some
unfortunate
results
when
for
instance
her
influence
in
india
was
at
its
height
she
issued
orders
that
all
hospital
windows
should
be
invariably
kept
open
the
authorities
who
knew
what
an
open
window
in
the
hot
weather
meant
protested
but
in
vain
miss
nightingale
was
incredulous
she
knew
nothing
of
the
hot
weather
but
she
did
know
the
value
of
fresh
air
from
personal
experience
the
authorities
were
talking
nonsense
and
the
windows
must
be
kept
open
all
the
year
round
there
was
a
great
outcry
from
all
the
doctors
in
india
but
she
was
firm
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
possible
that
her
terrible
commands
would
have
to
be
put
into
execution
lord
lawrence
however
was
viceroy
and
he
was
able
to
intimate
to
miss
nightingale
with
sufficient
authority
that
himself
had
decided
upon
the
question
and
that
his
decision
must
stand
even
against
her
own
upon
that
she
gave
way
but
reluctantly
and
quite
unconvinced
she
was
only
puzzled
by
the
unexpected
weakness
of
lord
lawrence
no
doubt
if
she
had
lived
today
and
if
her
experience
had
lain
not
among
cholera
cases
at
scutari
but
among
cases
in
panama
she
would
have
declared
fresh
air
a
fetish
and
would
have
maintained
to
her
dying
day
that
the
only
really
effective
way
of
dealing
with
disease
was
by
the
destruction
of
mosquitoes
yet
her
mind
so
positive
so
realistic
so
had
its
singular
revulsions
its
mysterious
moods
of
mysticism
and
of
doubt
at
times
lying
sleepless
in
the
early
hours
she
fell
into
long
strange
agonised
meditations
and
then
seizing
a
pencil
she
would
commit
to
paper
the
confessions
of
her
soul
the
morbid
longings
of
her
days
came
over
her
once
more
she
filled
page
after
page
with
father
she
wrote
submit
i
resign
myself
i
accept
with
all
my
heart
this
stretching
out
of
thy
hand
to
save
me
oh
how
vain
it
is
the
vanity
of
vanities
to
live
in
men
thoughts
instead
of
god
she
was
lonely
she
was
miserable
knowest
that
through
all
these
horrible
twenty
years
i
have
been
supported
by
the
belief
that
i
was
working
with
thee
who
would
bring
everyone
even
our
poor
nurses
to
perfection
and
yet
after
all
what
was
the
result
had
not
even
she
been
an
unprofitable
servant
one
night
waking
suddenly
she
saw
in
the
dim
light
of
the
tenebrous
shapes
upon
the
wall
the
past
rushed
back
upon
her
i
she
who
once
stood
on
that
crimean
height
she
wildly
asked
lady
with
a
lamp
shall
stand
the
lamp
shows
me
only
my
utter
shipwreck
she
sought
consolation
in
the
writings
of
the
mystics
and
in
a
correspondence
with
jowett
for
many
years
the
master
of
balliol
acted
as
her
spiritual
adviser
he
discussed
with
her
in
a
series
of
enormous
letters
the
problems
of
religion
and
philosophy
he
criticised
her
writings
on
those
subjects
with
the
tactful
sympathy
of
a
cleric
who
was
also
a
man
of
the
world
and
he
even
ventured
to
attempt
at
times
to
instil
into
her
rebellious
nature
some
of
his
own
peculiar
suavity
sometimes
think
he
told
her
you
ought
seriously
to
consider
how
your
work
may
be
carried
on
not
with
less
energy
but
in
a
calmer
spirit
i
am
not
blaming
the
past
but
i
want
the
peace
of
god
to
settle
on
the
future
he
recommended
her
to
spend
her
time
no
longer
in
with
government
offices
and
to
take
up
some
literary
work
he
urged
her
to
out
her
notion
of
divine
perfection
in
a
series
of
essays
for
frazer
magazine
she
did
so
and
the
result
was
submitted
to
froude
who
pronounced
the
second
essay
to
be
more
pregnant
than
the
first
i
can
not
tell
he
said
sanitary
with
disordered
intellects
the
effects
of
such
papers
will
be
carlyle
indeed
used
different
language
and
some
remarks
of
his
about
a
lost
lamb
bleating
on
the
mountains
having
been
unfortunately
repeated
to
miss
nightingale
required
all
jowett
suavity
to
keep
the
peace
in
a
letter
of
fourteen
sheets
he
turned
her
attention
from
this
painful
topic
towards
a
discussion
of
quietism
do
see
why
said
the
master
of
balliol
life
might
not
become
a
sort
of
passive
life
too
and
then
he
added
sometimes
fancy
there
are
possibilities
of
human
character
much
greater
than
have
been
realised
she
found
such
sentiments
helpful
underlining
them
in
blue
pencil
and
in
return
she
assisted
her
friend
with
a
long
series
of
elaborate
comments
upon
the
dialogues
of
plato
most
of
which
he
embodied
in
the
second
edition
of
his
translation
gradually
her
interest
became
more
personal
she
told
him
never
to
work
again
after
midnight
and
he
obeyed
her
then
she
helped
him
to
draw
up
a
special
form
of
daily
service
for
the
college
chapel
with
selections
from
the
psalms
under
the
heads
of
the
lord
god
the
judge
god
the
father
and
god
the
friend
though
indeed
this
project
was
never
realised
for
the
bishop
of
oxford
disallowed
the
alterations
exercising
his
legal
powers
on
the
advice
of
sir
travers
twiss
their
relations
became
intimate
spirit
of
the
psalm
and
the
spirit
of
the
nineteenth
psalm
should
be
united
in
our
lives
jowett
said
eventually
she
asked
him
to
do
her
a
singular
favour
would
he
knowing
what
he
did
of
her
religious
views
come
to
london
and
administer
to
her
the
holy
sacrament
he
did
not
hesitate
and
afterwards
declared
that
he
would
always
regard
the
occasion
as
a
solemn
event
in
his
life
he
was
devoted
to
her
though
the
precise
nature
of
his
feelings
towards
her
never
quite
transpired
her
feelings
towards
him
were
more
mixed
at
first
he
was
great
and
good
man
true
saint
jowett
but
as
time
went
on
some
gall
was
mingled
with
the
balm
the
acrimony
of
her
nature
asserted
itself
she
felt
that
she
gave
more
sympathy
than
she
received
she
was
exhausted
and
she
was
annoyed
by
his
conversation
her
tongue
one
day
could
not
refrain
from
shooting
out
at
him
comes
to
me
and
he
talks
to
me
she
said
if
i
were
someone
else
v
at
one
time
she
had
almost
decided
to
end
her
life
in
retirement
as
a
patient
at
thomas
hospital
but
partly
owing
to
the
persuasions
of
jowett
she
changed
her
mind
for
years
she
remained
in
south
street
and
in
south
street
she
died
as
old
age
approached
though
her
influence
with
the
official
world
gradually
diminished
her
activities
seemed
to
remain
as
intense
and
widespread
as
before
when
hospitals
were
to
be
built
when
schemes
of
sanitary
reform
were
in
agitation
when
wars
broke
out
she
was
still
the
adviser
of
all
europe
still
with
a
characteristic
she
watched
from
her
mayfair
bedroom
over
the
welfare
of
india
still
with
an
indefatigable
enthusiasm
she
pushed
forward
the
work
which
perhaps
was
nearer
to
her
heart
more
completely
her
own
than
all
the
rest
the
training
of
nurses
in
her
moments
of
deepest
depression
when
her
greatest
achievements
seemed
to
lose
their
lustre
she
thought
of
her
nurses
and
was
comforted
the
ways
of
god
she
found
were
strange
indeed
inefficient
i
was
in
the
crimea
she
noted
he
has
raised
up
from
it
trained
nursing
at
other
times
she
was
better
satisfied
looking
back
she
was
amazed
by
the
enormous
change
which
since
her
early
days
had
come
over
the
whole
treatment
of
illness
the
whole
conception
of
public
and
domestic
health
a
change
in
which
she
knew
she
had
played
her
part
one
of
her
indian
admirers
the
aga
khan
came
to
visit
her
she
expatiated
on
the
marvellous
advances
she
had
lived
to
see
in
the
management
of
hospitals
in
drainage
in
ventilation
in
sanitary
work
of
every
kind
there
was
a
pause
and
then
you
think
you
are
improving
asked
the
aga
khan
she
was
a
little
taken
aback
and
said
do
you
mean
by
improving
he
replied
more
in
god
she
saw
that
he
had
a
view
of
god
which
was
different
from
hers
most
interesting
man
she
noted
after
the
interview
you
could
never
teach
him
sanitation
when
old
age
actually
came
something
curious
happened
destiny
having
waited
very
patiently
played
a
queer
trick
on
miss
nightingale
the
benevolence
and
public
spirit
of
that
long
life
had
only
been
equalled
by
its
acerbity
her
virtue
had
dwelt
in
hardness
and
she
had
poured
forth
her
unstinted
usefulness
with
a
bitter
smile
upon
her
lips
and
now
the
sarcastic
years
brought
the
proud
woman
her
punishment
she
was
not
to
die
as
she
had
lived
the
sting
was
to
be
taken
out
of
her
she
was
to
be
made
soft
she
was
to
be
reduced
to
compliance
and
complacency
the
change
came
gradually
but
at
last
it
was
unmistakable
the
terrible
commander
who
had
driven
sidney
herbert
to
his
death
to
whom
jowett
had
applied
the
words
of
homer
amoton
memaniia
raging
insatiably
now
accepted
small
compliments
with
gratitude
and
indulged
in
sentimental
friendships
with
young
girls
the
author
of
notes
on
nursing
that
classical
compendium
of
the
besetting
sins
of
the
sisterhood
drawn
up
with
the
detailed
acrimony
the
vindictive
relish
of
a
swift
now
spent
long
hours
in
composing
sympathetic
addresses
to
probationers
whom
she
petted
and
wept
over
in
turn
and
at
the
same
time
there
appeared
a
corresponding
alteration
in
her
physical
mood
the
thin
angular
woman
with
her
haughty
eye
and
her
acrid
mouth
had
vanished
and
in
her
place
was
the
rounded
bulky
form
of
a
fat
old
lady
smiling
all
day
long
then
something
else
became
visible
the
brain
which
had
been
steeled
at
scutari
was
indeed
literally
growing
soft
senility
an
ever
more
and
more
amiable
senility
descended
towards
the
end
consciousness
itself
grew
lost
in
a
roseate
haze
and
melted
into
nothingness
it
was
just
then
three
years
before
her
death
when
she
was
years
old
that
those
in
authority
bethought
them
that
the
opportune
moment
had
come
for
bestowing
a
public
honour
on
florence
nightingale
she
was
offered
the
order
of
merit
that
order
whose
roll
contains
among
other
distinguished
names
those
of
sir
lawrence
alma
tadema
and
sir
edward
elgar
is
remarkable
chiefly
for
the
fact
that
as
its
title
indicates
it
is
bestowed
because
its
recipient
deserves
it
and
for
no
other
reason
miss
nightingale
representatives
accepted
the
honour
and
her
name
after
a
lapse
of
many
years
once
more
appeared
in
the
press
congratulations
from
all
sides
came
pouring
in
there
was
a
universal
burst
of
enthusiasm
a
final
revivification
of
the
ancient
myth
among
her
other
admirers

german
emperor

this
opportunity

his
feelings

majesty

then
by

the

was
brought
to

was
a
little
ceremony
of
presentation
sir

a
short
speech
stepped
forward
and
handed
the
insignia
of
the
order
to
miss

up
by
pillows

dimly
recognised
that
some
compliment
was
being
paid
her
kind

of

to
appoint
a
successor
to
the
post
reform
was
in
the
air
political
social
religious
there
was
even
a
feeling
abroad
that
our
great
public
schools
were
not
quite
all
that
they
should
be
and
that
some
change
or
other
no
one
precisely
knew
what
but
some
change
in
the
system
of
their
management
was
highly
desirable
thus
it
was
natural
that
when
the
twelve
noblemen
and
gentlemen
who
had
determined
to
be
guided
entirely
by
the
merits
of
the
candidates
found
among
the
testimonials
pouring
in
upon
them
a
letter
from
hawkins
the
provost
of
oriel
predicting
that
if
they
elected
thomas
arnold
he
would
the
face
of
education
all
through
the
public
schools
of
england
they
hesitated
no
longer
obviously
thomas
arnold
was
their
man
he
was
elected
therefore
received
as
was
fitting
orders
became
as
was
no
less
fitting
a
doctor
of
divinity
and
in
august
took
up
the
duties
of
his
office
all
that
was
known
of
the
previous
life
of
arnold
seemed
to
justify
the
prediction
of
the
provost
of
oriel
and
the
choice
of
the
trustees
the
son
of
a
respectable
collector
of
customs
he
had
been
educated
at
winchester
and
at
oxford
where
his
industry
and
piety
had
given
him
a
conspicuous
place
among
his
fellow
students
it
is
true
that
as
a
schoolboy
a
certain
pompousness
in
the
style
of
his
letters
home
suggested
to
the
more
among
his
relatives
the
possibility
that
young
thomas
might
grow
up
into
a
prig
but
after
all
what
else
could
be
expected
from
a
child
who
at
the
age
of
three
had
been
presented
by
his
father
as
a
reward
for
proficiency
in
his
studies
with
the
volumes
of
smollett
history
of
england
his
career
at
oxford
had
been
a
distinguished
one
winding
up
with
an
oriel
fellowship
it
was
at
about
this
time
that
the
smooth
and
satisfactory
progress
of
his
life
was
for
a
moment
interrupted
he
began
to
be
troubled
by
religious
doubts
these
doubts
as
we
learn
from
one
of
his
contemporaries
who
afterwards
became
justice
coleridge
not
low
nor
rationalistic
in
their
tendency
according
to
the
bad
sense
of
that
term
there
was
no
indisposition
in
him
to
believe
merely
because
the
article
transcended
his
reason
he
doubted
the
proof
and
the
interpretation
of
the
textual
authority
in
his
perturbation
arnold
consulted
keble
who
was
at
that
time
one
of
his
closest
friends
and
a
fellow
of
the
same
college
subject
of
these
distressing
thoughts
keble
wrote
to
coleridge
that
most
awful
one
on
which
all
very
inquisitive
reasoning
minds
are
i
believe
most
liable
to
such
temptations
i
mean
the
doctrine
of
the
blessed
trinity
do
not
start
my
dear
coleridge
i
do
not
believe
that
arnold
has
any
serious
scruples
of
the
understanding
about
it
but
it
is
a
defect
of
his
mind
that
he
can
not
get
rid
of
a
certain
feeling
of
objections
what
was
to
be
done
keble
advice
was
peremptory
arnold
was
to
pause
in
his
inquiries
to
pray
earnestly
for
help
and
light
from
above
and
turn
himself
more
strongly
than
ever
to
the
practical
duties
of
a
holy
life
he
did
so
and
the
result
was
all
that
could
be
wished
he
soon
found
himself
blessed
with
perfect
peace
of
mind
and
a
settled
conviction
one
other
difficulty
and
one
only
we
hear
of
at
this
point
in
his
life
his
dislike
of
early
rising
amounted
we
are
told
to
a
constitutional
infirmity
this
weakness
too
he
overcame
yet
not
quite
so
successfully
as
his
doubts
upon
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
for
in
afterlife
the
doctor
would
often
declare
early
rising
continued
to
be
a
daily
effort
to
him
and
that
in
this
instance
he
never
found
the
truth
of
the
usual
rule
that
all
things
are
made
easy
by
custom
he
married
young
and
settled
down
in
the
country
as
a
private
tutor
for
youths
preparing
for
the
universities
there
he
remained
for
ten
years
happy
busy
and
sufficiently
prosperous
occupied
chiefly
with
his
pupils
he
nevertheless
devoted
much
of
his
energy
to
wider
interests
he
delivered
a
series
of
sermons
in
the
parish
church
and
he
began
to
write
a
history
of
rome
in
the
hope
as
he
said
that
its
tone
might
be
such
the
strictest
of
what
is
called
the
evangelical
party
would
not
object
to
putting
it
into
the
hands
of
their
children
his
views
on
the
religious
and
political
condition
of
the
country
began
to
crystallise
he
was
alarmed
by
the
of
christian
principle
in
the
literature
of
the
day
looking
forward
anxiously
to
approach
of
a
greater
struggle
between
good
and
evil
than
the
world
has
yet
seen
and
after
a
serious
conversation
with
whately
began
to
conceive
the
necessity
of
considerable
alterations
in
the
church
establishment
all
who
knew
him
during
these
years
were
profoundly
impressed
by
the
earnestness
of
his
religious
convictions
and
feelings
which
as
one
observer
said
ever
bursting
forth
it
was
impossible
to
disregard
his
consciousness
of
the
invisible
world
and
peculiar
feeling
of
love
and
adoration
which
he
entertained
towards
our
lord
jesus
christ
manner
of
awful
reverence
when
speaking
of
god
or
of
the
scriptures
was
particularly
striking
one
could
know
him
even
a
little
said
another
friend
not
be
struck
by
his
absolute
wrestling
with
evil
so
that
like
paul
he
seemed
to
be
battling
with
the
wicked
one
and
yet
with
a
feeling
of
god
help
on
his
side
such
was
the
man
who
at
the
age
of
became
headmaster
of
rugby
his
outward
appearance
was
the
index
of
his
inward
character
everything
about
him
denoted
energy
earnestness
and
the
best
intentions
his
legs
perhaps
were
shorter
than
they
should
have
been
but
the
sturdy
athletic
frame
especially
when
it
was
swathed
as
it
usually
was
in
the
flowing
robes
of
a
doctor
of
divinity
was
full
of
an
imposing
vigour
and
his
head
set
decisively
upon
the
collar
stock
and
bands
of
ecclesiastical
tradition
clearly
belonged
to
a
person
of
eminence
the
thick
dark
clusters
of
his
hair
his
bushy
eyebrows
and
curling
whiskers
his
straight
nose
and
bulky
chin
his
firm
and
lower
lip
all
these
revealed
a
temperament
of
ardour
and
determination
his
eyes
were
bright
and
large
they
were
also
obviously
honest
and
yet
why
was
it
was
it
in
the
lines
of
the
mouth
or
the
frown
on
the
forehead
it
was
hard
to
say
but
it
was
unmistakable
there
was
a
slightly
puzzled
look
upon
the
face
of
arnold
and
certainly
if
he
was
to
fulfil
the
prophecy
of
the
provost
of
oriel
the
task
before
him
was
sufficiently
perplexing
the
public
schools
of
those
days
were
still
virgin
forests
untouched
by
the
hand
of
reform
keate
was
still
reigning
at
eton
and
we
possess
in
the
records
of
his
pupils
a
picture
of
the
public
school
education
of
the
early
nineteenth
century
in
its
most
characteristic
state
it
was
a
system
of
anarchy
tempered
by
despotism
hundreds
of
boys
herded
together
in
miscellaneous
or
in
that
grim
chamber
at
whose
name
in
after
years
aged
statesmen
and
warriors
would
turn
pale
lived
badgered
and
overawed
by
the
furious
incursions
of
an
irascible
little
old
man
carrying
a
bundle
of
a
life
in
which
licensed
barbarism
was
mingled
with
the
daily
and
hourly
study
of
the
niceties
of
ovidian
verse
it
was
a
life
of
freedom
and
terror
of
prosody
and
rebellion
of
interminable
floggings
and
appalling
practical
jokes
keate
ruled
unaided
for
the
undermasters
were
few
and
of
no
account
by
sheer
force
of
character
but
there
were
times
when
even
that
indomitable
will
was
overwhelmed
by
the
flood
of
lawlessness
every
sunday
afternoon
he
attempted
to
read
sermons
to
the
whole
school
assembled
and
every
sunday
afternoon
the
whole
school
assembled
shouted
him
down
the
scenes
in
chapel
were
far
from
edifying
while
some
antique
fellow
doddered
in
the
pulpit
rats
would
be
let
loose
to
scurry
among
the
legs
of
the
exploding
boys
but
next
morning
the
hand
of
discipline
would
reassert
itself
and
the
savage
ritual
of
the
would
remind
a
batch
of
whimpering
children
that
though
sins
against
man
and
god
might
be
forgiven
them
a
false
quantity
could
only
be
expiated
in
tears
and
blood
from
two
sides
this
system
of
education
was
beginning
to
be
assailed
by
the
awakening
public
opinion
of
the
upper
middle
classes
on
the
one
hand
there
was
a
desire
for
a
more
liberal
curriculum
on
the
other
there
was
a
demand
for
a
higher
moral
tone
the
growing
utilitarianism
of
the
age
viewed
with
impatience
a
course
of
instruction
which
excluded
every
branch
of
knowledge
except
classical
philology
while
its
growing
respectability
was
shocked
by
such
a
spectacle
of
disorder
and
brutality
as
was
afforded
by
the
eton
of
keate
public
schools
said
the
rev
bowdler
the
very
seats
and
nurseries
of
vice
arnold
agreed
he
was
convinced
of
the
necessity
for
reform
but
it
was
only
natural
that
to
one
of
his
temperament
and
education
it
should
have
been
the
moral
rather
than
the
intellectual
side
of
the
question
which
impressed
itself
upon
his
mind
doubtless
it
was
important
to
teach
boys
something
more
than
the
bleak
rigidities
of
the
ancient
tongues
but
how
much
more
important
to
instil
into
them
the
elements
of
character
and
the
principles
of
conduct
his
great
object
throughout
his
career
at
rugby
was
as
he
repeatedly
said
to
the
school
a
place
of
really
christian
education
to
introduce
religious
principle
into
education
was
his
earnest
wish
he
wrote
to
a
friend
when
he
first
became
headmaster
to
do
this
would
be
to
succeed
beyond
all
my
hopes
it
would
be
a
happiness
so
great
that
i
think
the
world
would
yield
me
nothing
comparable
to
it
and
he
was
constantly
impressing
these
sentiments
upon
his
pupils
i
have
often
said
before
he
told
them
repeat
now
what
we
must
look
for
here
is
first
religious
and
moral
principle
secondly
gentlemanly
conduct
and
thirdly
intellectual
ability
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
arnold
point
of
view
was
shared
by
the
great
mass
of
english
parents
they
cared
very
little
for
classical
scholarship
no
doubt
they
would
be
pleased
to
find
that
their
sons
were
being
instructed
in
history
or
in
french
but
their
real
hopes
their
real
wishes
were
of
a
very
different
kind
i
tell
him
to
mind
his
work
and
say
he
sent
to
school
to
make
himself
a
good
scholar
meditated
old
squire
brown
when
he
was
sending
off
tom
for
the
first
time
to
rugby
but
he
is
sent
to
school
for
that
at
any
rate
not
for
that
mainly
i
do
care
a
straw
for
greek
particles
or
the
digamma
no
more
does
his
mother
what
is
he
sent
to
school
for
if
he
only
turn
out
a
brave
helpful
englishman
and
a
christian
that
all
i
want
that
was
all
and
it
was
that
that
arnold
set
himself
to
accomplish
but
how
was
he
to
achieve
his
end
was
he
to
improve
the
character
of
his
pupils
by
gradually
spreading
around
them
an
atmosphere
of
cultivation
and
intelligence
by
bringing
them
into
close
and
friendly
contact
with
civilised
men
and
even
perhaps
with
civilised
women
by
introducing
into
the
life
of
his
school
all
that
he
could
of
the
humane
enlightened
and
progressive
elements
in
the
life
of
the
community
on
the
whole
he
thought
not
such
considerations
left
him
cold
and
he
preferred
to
be
guided
by
the
general
laws
of
providence
it
only
remained
to
discover
what
those
general
laws
were
he
consulted
the
old
testament
and
could
doubt
no
longer
he
would
apply
to
his
scholars
as
he
himself
explained
to
them
in
one
of
his
sermons
principle
which
seemed
to
him
to
have
been
adopted
in
the
training
of
the
childhood
of
the
human
race
itself
he
would
treat
the
boys
at
rugby
as
jehovah
had
treated
the
chosen
people
he
would
found
a
theocracy
and
there
should
be
judges
in
israel
for
this
purpose
the
system
prevalent
in
most
of
the
public
schools
of
the
day
by
which
the
elder
boys
were
deputed
to
keep
order
in
the
lay
ready
to
arnold
hand
he
found
the
praepostor
a
mere
disciplinary
convenience
and
he
converted
him
into
an
organ
of
government
every
boy
in
the
sixth
form
became
ipso
facto
a
praepostor
with
powers
extending
over
every
department
of
school
life
and
the
sixth
form
as
a
body
was
erected
into
an
authority
responsible
to
the
headmaster
and
to
the
headmaster
alone
for
the
internal
management
of
the
school
this
was
the
means
by
which
arnold
hoped
to
turn
rugby
into
place
of
really
christian
education
the
boys
were
to
work
out
their
own
salvation
like
the
human
race
he
himself
involved
in
awful
grandeur
ruled
remotely
through
his
chosen
instruments
from
an
inaccessible
heaven
remotely
and
yet
with
an
omnipresent
force
as
the
israelite
of
old
knew
that
his
almighty
lawgiver
might
at
any
moment
thunder
to
him
from
the
whirlwind
or
appear
before
his
very
eyes
the
visible
embodiment
of
power
or
wrath
so
the
rugby
schoolboy
walked
in
a
holy
dread
of
some
sudden
manifestation
of
the
sweeping
gown
the
majestic
tone
the
piercing
glance
of
arnold
among
the
lower
forms
of
the
school
his
appearances
were
rare
and
transitory
and
upon
these
young
children
chief
impression
we
are
told
of
extreme
fear
the
older
boys
saw
more
of
him
but
they
did
not
see
much
outside
the
sixth
form
no
part
of
the
school
came
into
close
intercourse
with
him
and
it
would
often
happen
that
a
boy
would
leave
rugby
without
having
had
any
personal
communication
with
him
at
all
yet
the
effect
which
he
produced
upon
the
great
mass
of
his
pupils
was
remarkable
the
prestige
of
his
presence
and
the
elevation
of
his
sentiments
were
things
which
it
was
impossible
to
forget
in
class
every
line
of
his
countenance
every
shade
of
his
manner
imprinted
themselves
indelibly
on
the
minds
of
the
boys
who
sat
under
him
one
of
these
writing
long
afterwards
has
described
in
phrases
still
impregnated
with
awestruck
reverence
the
familiar
details
of
the
scene
glance
with
which
he
looked
round
in
the
few
moments
of
silence
before
the
lesson
began
and
which
seemed
to
speak
his
sense
of
his
own
position
attitude
in
which
he
stood
turning
over
the
pages
of
facciolati
lexicon
or
pole
synopsis
with
his
eye
fixed
upon
the
boy
who
was
pausing
to
give
an
answer
pleased
look
and
the
cheerful
thank
you
which
followed
upon
a
successful
translation
fall
of
his
countenance
with
its
deepening
severity
the
stern
elevation
of
the
eyebrows
the
sudden
sit
down
which
followed
upon
the
reverse
and
startling
earnestness
with
which
he
would
check
in
a
moment
the
slightest
approach
to
levity
to
be
rebuked
however
mildly
by
arnold
was
a
potable
experience
one
boy
could
never
forget
how
he
drew
a
distinction
between
amusement
and
as
encroached
on
the
next
day
duties
nor
the
tone
of
voice
with
which
the
doctor
added
then
it
immediately
becomes
what
paul
calls
revelling
another
remembered
to
his
dying
day
his
reproof
of
some
boys
who
had
behaved
badly
during
prayers
said
arnold
is
satan
work
more
evidently
manifest
than
in
turning
holy
things
to
ridicule
on
such
occasions
as
another
of
his
pupils
described
it
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
consciousness
almost
amounting
to
solemnity
that
his
eye
was
upon
you
he
looked
into
your
inmost
heart
with
the
boys
in
the
sixth
form
and
with
them
alone
the
severe
formality
of
his
demeanour
was
to
some
degree
relaxed
it
was
his
wish
in
his
relations
with
the
praepostors
to
allow
the
master
to
be
occasionally
merged
in
the
friend
from
time
to
time
he
chatted
with
them
in
a
familiar
manner
once
a
term
he
asked
them
to
dinner
and
during
the
summer
holidays
he
invited
them
in
rotation
to
stay
with
him
in
westmorland
it
was
obvious
that
the
primitive
methods
of
discipline
which
had
reached
their
apogee
under
the
dominion
of
keate
were
altogether
incompatible
with
arnold
view
of
the
functions
of
a
headmaster
and
the
proper
governance
of
a
public
school
clearly
it
was
not
for
such
as
he
to
demean
himself
by
bellowing
and
cuffing
by
losing
his
temper
once
an
hour
and
by
wreaking
his
vengeance
with
indiscriminate
flagellations
order
must
be
kept
in
other
ways
the
worst
boys
were
publicly
expelled
many
were
silently
removed
and
when
arnold
considered
that
a
flogging
was
necessary
he
administered
it
with
gravity
for
he
had
no
theoretical
objection
to
corporal
punishment
on
the
contrary
he
supported
it
as
was
his
wont
by
an
appeal
to
general
principles
is
he
said
essential
inferiority
in
a
boy
as
compared
with
a
man
and
hence
there
is
no
equality
the
exercise
of
superiority
implied
in
personal
chastisement
inevitably
followed
he
was
particularly
disgusted
by
the
view
that
correction
as
he
phrased
it
was
an
insult
or
a
degradation
to
the
boy
upon
whom
it
was
inflicted
and
to
accustom
young
boys
to
think
so
appeared
to
him
to
be
mischievous
an
age
he
wrote
it
is
almost
impossible
to
find
a
true
manly
sense
of
the
degradation
of
guilt
or
faults
where
is
the
wisdom
of
encouraging
a
fantastic
sense
of
the
degradation
of
personal
correction
what
can
be
more
false
or
more
adverse
to
the
simplicity
sobriety
and
humbleness
of
mind
which
are
the
best
ornaments
of
youth
and
offer
the
best
promise
of
a
noble
manhood
one
had
not
to
look
far
he
added
for
fruits
of
such
a
system
in
paris
during
the
revolution
of
an
officer
observed
a
boy
of
twelve
insulting
the
soldiers
and
the
action
was
then
raging
merely
struck
him
with
the
flat
part
of
his
sword
as
the
fit
chastisement
for
boyish
impertinence
but
the
boy
had
been
taught
to
consider
his
person
sacred
and
that
a
blow
was
a
deadly
insult
he
therefore
followed
the
officer
and
having
watched
his
opportunity
took
deliberate
aim
at
him
with
a
pistol
and
murdered
him
such
were
the
alarming
results
of
insufficient
whipping
arnold
did
not
apply
this
doctrine
to
the
praepostors
but
the
boys
in
the
lower
parts
of
the
school
felt
its
benefits
with
a
double
force
the
sixth
form
was
not
only
excused
from
chastisement
it
was
given
the
right
to
chastise
the
younger
children
scourged
both
by
dr
arnold
and
by
the
elder
children
were
given
every
opportunity
of
acquiring
the
simplicity
sobriety
and
humbleness
of
mind
which
are
the
best
ornaments
of
youth
in
the
actual
sphere
of
teaching
arnold
reforms
were
tentative
and
few
he
introduced
modern
history
modern
languages
and
mathematics
into
the
school
curriculum
but
the
results
were
not
encouraging
he
devoted
to
the
teaching
of
history
one
hour
a
week
yet
though
he
took
care
to
inculcate
in
these
lessons
a
wholesome
hatred
of
moral
evil
and
to
point
out
from
time
to
time
the
indications
of
the
providential
government
of
the
world
his
pupils
never
seemed
to
make
much
progress
in
the
subject
could
it
have
been
that
the
time
allotted
to
it
was
insufficient
arnold
had
some
suspicions
that
this
might
be
the
case
with
modern
languages
there
was
the
same
difficulty
here
his
hopes
were
certainly
not
excessive
assume
it
he
wrote
the
foundation
of
all
my
view
of
the
case
that
boys
at
a
public
school
never
will
learn
to
speak
or
pronounce
french
well
under
any
circumstances
it
would
be
enough
if
they
could
it
grammatically
as
a
dead
language
but
even
this
they
very
seldom
managed
to
do
know
too
well
he
was
obliged
to
confess
that
most
of
the
boys
would
pass
a
very
poor
examination
even
in
french
grammar
but
so
it
is
with
their
mathematics
and
so
it
will
be
with
any
branch
of
knowledge
that
is
taught
but
seldom
and
is
felt
to
be
quite
subordinate
to
the
boys
main
study
the
boys
main
study
remained
the
dead
languages
of
greece
and
rome
that
the
classics
should
form
the
basis
of
all
teaching
was
an
axiom
with
arnold
study
of
language
he
said
to
me
as
if
it
was
given
for
the
very
purpose
of
forming
the
human
mind
in
youth
and
the
greek
and
latin
languages
seem
the
very
instruments
by
which
this
is
to
be
effected
certainly
there
was
something
providential
about
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
teacher
as
well
as
of
the
taught
if
greek
and
latin
had
not
been
in
that
convenient
manner
arnold
who
had
spent
his
life
in
acquiring
those
languages
might
have
discovered
that
he
had
acquired
them
in
vain
as
it
was
he
could
set
the
noses
of
his
pupils
to
the
grindstone
of
syntax
and
prosody
with
a
clear
conscience
latin
verses
and
greek
prepositions
divided
between
them
the
labours
of
the
week
as
time
went
on
he
became
he
declared
convinced
that
it
is
not
knowledge
but
the
means
of
gaining
knowledge
which
i
have
to
teach
the
reading
of
the
school
was
devoted
almost
entirely
to
selected
passages
from
the
prose
writers
of
antiquity
he
remarked
not
like
poetry
perhaps
his
own
poetical
taste
was
a
little
dubious
at
any
rate
it
is
certain
that
he
considered
the
greek
tragedians
greatly
overrated
and
that
he
ranked
propertius
as
indifferent
poet
as
for
aristophanes
owing
to
his
strong
moral
disapprobation
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
read
him
until
he
was
forty
when
it
is
true
he
was
much
struck
by
the
but
juvenal
the
doctor
could
never
bring
himself
to
read
at
all
physical
science
was
not
taught
at
rugby
since
in
opinion
it
was
too
great
a
subject
to
be
studied
en
parergo
obviously
only
two
alternatives
were
possible
it
must
either
take
the
chief
place
in
the
school
curriculum
or
it
must
be
left
out
altogether
before
such
a
choice
arnold
did
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
than
have
physical
science
the
principal
thing
in
my
mind
he
exclaimed
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
i
would
gladly
have
him
think
that
the
sun
went
around
the
earth
and
that
the
stars
were
so
many
spangles
set
in
the
bright
blue
firmament
surely
the
one
thing
needful
for
a
christian
and
an
english
man
to
study
is
christian
moral
and
political
philosophy
a
christian
and
an
englishman
after
all
it
was
not
in
the
classroom
nor
in
the
that
the
essential
elements
of
instruction
could
be
imparted
which
should
qualify
the
youthful
neophyte
to
deserve
those
names
the
final
the
fundamental
lesson
could
only
be
taught
in
the
school
chapel
in
the
school
chapel
the
centre
of
system
of
education
was
inevitably
fixed
there
too
the
doctor
himself
appeared
in
the
plenitude
of
his
dignity
and
his
enthusiasm
there
with
the
morning
sun
shining
on
the
freshly
scrubbed
faces
of
his
pupils
or
in
the
dusk
of
evening
through
a
glimmer
of
candles
his
stately
form
rapt
in
devotion
or
vibrant
with
exhortation
would
dominate
the
scene
every
phase
of
the
church
service
seemed
to
receive
its
supreme
expression
in
his
voice
his
attitude
his
look
during
the
te
deum
his
whole
countenance
would
light
up
and
he
read
the
psalms
with
such
conviction
that
boys
would
often
declare
after
hearing
him
that
they
understood
them
now
for
the
first
time
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
creeds
in
public
worship
ought
to
be
used
as
triumphant
hymns
of
thanksgiving
and
in
accordance
with
this
view
although
unfortunately
he
possessed
no
natural
gift
for
music
he
regularly
joined
in
the
chanting
of
the
nicene
creed
with
a
visible
animation
and
a
peculiar
fervour
which
it
was
impossible
to
forget
the
communion
service
he
regarded
as
a
direct
and
special
counterpoise
to
that
false
communion
and
false
companionship
which
as
he
often
observed
was
a
great
source
of
mischief
in
the
school
and
he
bent
himself
down
with
glistening
eyes
and
trembling
voice
and
looks
of
paternal
solicitude
in
the
administration
of
the
elements
nor
was
it
only
the
different
sections
of
the
liturgy
but
the
very
divisions
of
the
ecclesiastical
year
that
reflected
themselves
in
his
demeanour
the
most
careless
observer
we
are
told
not
fail
to
be
struck
by
the
triumphant
exultation
of
his
whole
manner
on
easter
sunday
though
it
needed
a
more
familiar
eye
to
discern
the
subtleties
in
his
bearing
which
were
produced
by
the
approach
or
advent
and
the
solemn
thoughts
which
it
awakened
of
the
advance
of
human
life
the
progress
of
the
human
race
and
the
condition
of
the
church
of
england
at
the
end
of
the
evening
service
the
culminating
moment
of
the
week
had
come
the
doctor
delivered
his
sermon
it
was
not
until
then
as
all
who
had
known
him
agreed
it
was
not
until
one
had
heard
and
seen
him
in
the
pulpit
that
one
could
fully
realise
what
it
was
to
be
face
to
face
with
arnold
the
whole
character
of
the
man
so
we
are
assured
stood
at
last
revealed
his
congregation
sat
in
fixed
attention
with
the
exception
of
the
younger
boys
whose
thoughts
occasionally
wandered
while
he
propounded
the
general
principles
both
of
his
own
conduct
and
that
of
the
almighty
or
indicated
the
bearing
of
the
incidents
of
jewish
history
in
the
sixth
century
upon
the
conduct
of
english
schoolboys
in
then
more
than
ever
his
deep
consciousness
of
the
invisible
world
became
evident
then
more
than
ever
he
seemed
to
be
battling
with
the
wicked
one
for
his
sermons
ran
on
the
eternal
themes
of
the
darkness
of
evil
the
craft
of
the
tempter
the
punishment
of
obliquity
and
he
justified
the
persistence
with
which
he
dwelt
upon
these
painful
subjects
by
an
appeal
to
a
general
principle
spirit
of
elijah
he
said
ever
precede
the
spirit
of
christ
the
impression
produced
upon
the
boys
was
remarkable
it
was
noticed
that
even
the
most
careless
would
sometimes
during
the
course
of
the
week
refer
almost
involuntarily
to
the
sermon
of
the
past
sunday
as
a
condemnation
of
what
they
were
doing
others
were
heard
to
wonder
how
it
was
that
the
doctor
preaching
to
which
they
had
attended
at
the
time
so
assiduously
seemed
after
all
to
have
such
a
small
effect
upon
what
they
did
an
old
gentleman
recalling
those
vanished
hours
tried
to
recapture
in
words
his
state
of
mind
as
he
sat
in
the
darkened
chapel
while
arnold
sermons
with
their
exhortations
their
grave
and
sombre
messages
of
incalculable
import
clothed
like
arnold
body
in
its
gown
and
bands
in
the
traditional
stiffness
of
a
formal
phraseology
reverberated
through
his
adolescent
ears
used
he
said
listen
to
those
sermons
from
first
to
last
with
a
kind
of
awe
his
success
was
not
limited
to
his
pupils
and
immediate
auditors
the
sermons
were
collected
into
five
large
volumes
they
were
the
first
of
their
kind
and
they
were
received
with
admiration
by
a
wide
circle
of
pious
readers
queen
victoria
herself
possessed
a
copy
in
which
several
passages
were
marked
in
pencil
by
the
royal
hand
arnold
energies
were
by
no
means
exhausted
by
his
duties
at
rugby
he
became
known
not
merely
as
a
headmaster
but
as
a
public
man
he
held
decided
opinions
upon
a
large
number
of
topics
and
he
enunciated
them
based
as
they
were
almost
invariably
upon
general
principles
in
pamphlets
in
prefaces
and
in
magazine
articles
with
an
impressive
he
was
as
he
constantly
declared
a
liberal
in
his
opinion
by
the
very
constitution
of
human
nature
the
principles
of
progress
and
reform
had
been
those
of
wisdom
and
justice
in
every
age
of
the
world
except
one
that
which
had
preceded
the
fall
of
man
from
paradise
had
he
lived
then
arnold
would
have
been
a
conservative
as
it
was
his
liberalism
was
tempered
by
an
of
the
spirit
of
of
the
american
war
of
the
french
economistes
and
of
the
english
whigs
of
the
latter
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
he
always
entertained
a
profound
respect
for
the
hereditary
peerage
it
might
almost
be
said
in
fact
that
he
was
an
orthodox
liberal
he
believed
in
toleration
too
within
limits
that
is
to
say
in
the
toleration
of
those
with
whom
he
agreed
would
give
james
mill
as
much
opportunity
for
advocating
his
opinion
he
said
is
consistent
with
a
voyage
to
botany
bay
he
had
become
convinced
of
the
duty
of
sympathising
with
the
lower
orders
ever
since
he
had
made
a
serious
study
of
the
epistle
of
james
but
he
perceived
clearly
that
the
lower
orders
fell
into
two
classes
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
distinguish
between
them
there
were
the
poor
and
there
were
the
others
am
glad
that
you
have
made
acquaintance
with
some
of
the
good
poor
he
wrote
to
a
cambridge
undergraduate
quite
agree
with
you
that
it
is
most
instructive
to
visit
them
arnold
himself
occasionally
visited
them
in
rugby
and
the
condescension
with
which
he
shook
hands
with
old
men
and
women
of
the
working
classes
was
long
remembered
in
the
neighbourhood
as
for
the
others
he
regarded
them
with
horror
and
alarm
disorders
in
our
social
state
he
wrote
to
the
chevalier
bunsen
in
to
me
to
continue
unabated
you
have
heard
i
doubt
not
of
the
trades
unions
a
fearful
engine
of
mischief
ready
to
not
or
to
assassinate
and
i
see
no
counteracting
power
on
the
whole
his
view
of
the
condition
of
england
was
a
gloomy
one
he
recommended
a
correspondent
to
read
iii
v
xxii
jeremiah
v
xxii
xxx
amos
iv
and
habakkuk
ii
adding
will
be
struck
i
think
with
the
close
resemblance
of
our
own
state
with
that
of
the
jews
before
the
second
destruction
of
jerusalem
when
he
was
told
that
the
gift
of
tongues
had
descended
on
the
irvingites
at
glasgow
he
was
not
surprised
should
take
it
he
said
as
a
sign
of
the
coming
of
the
day
of
the
lord
and
he
was
convinced
that
the
day
of
the
lord
was
coming
termination
of
one
of
the
great
greek
aiones
of
the
human
race
of
that
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
wherever
he
looked
he
saw
wars
tumults
pestilences
earthquakes
all
marking
the
time
of
one
of
peculiar
seasons
of
visitation
his
only
uncertainty
was
whether
this
termination
of
an
greek
aion
would
turn
out
to
be
the
absolutely
final
one
but
that
he
believed
created
being
knows
or
can
know
in
any
case
he
had
the
slightest
expectation
of
what
is
commonly
meant
by
the
millennium
and
his
only
consolation
was
that
he
preferred
the
present
ministry
inefficient
as
it
was
to
the
tories
he
had
planned
a
great
work
on
church
and
state
in
which
he
intended
to
lay
bare
the
causes
and
to
point
out
the
remedies
of
the
evils
which
afflicted
society
its
theme
was
to
be
not
the
alliance
or
union
but
the
absolute
identity
of
the
church
and
the
state
and
he
felt
sure
that
if
only
this
fundamental
truth
were
fully
realised
by
the
public
a
general
reformation
would
follow
unfortunately
however
as
time
went
on
the
public
seemed
to
realise
it
less
and
less
in
spite
of
his
protests
not
only
were
jews
admitted
to
parliament
but
a
jew
was
actually
appointed
a
governor
of
christ
hospital
and
scripture
was
not
made
an
obligatory
subject
at
the
london
university
there
was
one
point
in
his
theory
which
was
not
quite
plain
to
arnold
if
church
and
state
were
absolutely
identical
it
became
important
to
decide
precisely
which
classes
of
persons
were
to
be
excluded
owing
to
their
beliefs
from
the
community
jews
for
instance
were
decidedly
outside
the
pale
while
dissenters
so
arnold
argued
were
as
decidedly
within
it
but
what
was
the
position
of
the
unitarians
were
they
or
were
they
not
members
of
the
church
of
christ
this
was
one
of
those
puzzling
questions
which
deepened
the
frown
upon
the
doctor
forehead
and
intensified
the
pursing
of
his
lips
he
thought
long
and
earnestly
upon
the
subject
he
wrote
elaborate
letters
on
it
to
various
correspondents
but
his
conclusions
remained
indefinite
great
objection
to
unitarianism
he
wrote
its
present
form
in
england
is
that
it
makes
christ
virtually
dead
yet
he
expressed
fervent
hope
that
if
we
could
get
rid
of
the
athanasian
creed
many
good
unitarians
would
join
their
fellow
christians
in
bowing
the
knee
to
him
who
is
lord
both
of
the
dead
and
the
living
amid
these
perplexities
it
was
disquieting
to
learn
that
is
becoming
very
prevalent
in
boston
he
inquired
anxiously
as
to
its
there
but
received
no
very
illuminating
answer
the
whole
matter
continued
to
be
wrapped
in
a
painful
obscurity
there
were
he
believed
unitarians
and
unitarians
and
he
could
say
no
more
in
the
meantime
pending
the
completion
of
his
great
work
he
occupied
himself
with
putting
forward
various
suggestions
of
a
practical
kind
he
advocated
the
restoration
of
the
order
of
deacons
which
he
observed
had
long
been
the
reality
dead
for
he
believed
that
plan
of
this
sort
might
be
the
small
end
of
the
wedge
by
which
antichrist
might
hereafter
be
burst
asunder
like
the
dragon
of
bel
temple
but
the
order
of
deacons
was
never
restored
and
arnold
turned
his
attention
elsewhere
urging
in
a
weighty
pamphlet
the
desirabitity
of
authorising
military
officers
in
congregations
where
it
was
impossible
to
procure
the
presence
of
clergy
to
administer
the
eucharist
as
well
as
baptism
it
was
with
the
object
of
laying
such
views
as
these
before
the
public
tell
them
plainly
as
he
said
evils
that
exist
and
lead
them
if
i
can
to
their
causes
and
remedies
that
he
started
in
a
weekly
newspaper
the
englishman
register
the
paper
was
not
a
success
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
set
out
to
improve
its
readers
morally
and
that
it
preserved
in
every
article
an
avowedly
christian
tone
after
a
few
weeks
and
after
he
had
spent
upon
it
more
than
it
came
to
an
end
altogether
the
prospect
was
decidedly
discouraging
after
all
his
efforts
the
absolute
identity
of
church
and
state
remained
as
unrecognised
as
ever
deep
he
was
at
last
obliged
to
confess
the
distinction
between
the
church
and
the
state
seated
in
our
laws
our
language
and
our
very
notions
that
nothing
less
than
a
miraculous
interposition
of
god
providence
seems
capable
of
eradicating
it
arnold
waited
in
vain
but
he
did
not
wait
in
idleness
he
attacked
the
same
question
from
another
side
he
explored
the
writings
of
the
christian
fathers
and
began
to
compose
a
commentary
on
the
new
testament
in
his
view
the
scriptures
were
as
fit
a
subject
as
any
other
book
for
free
inquiry
and
the
exercise
of
the
individual
judgment
and
it
was
in
this
spirit
that
he
set
about
the
interpretation
of
them
he
was
not
afraid
of
facing
apparent
difficulties
of
admitting
inconsistencies
or
even
errors
in
the
sacred
text
thus
he
observed
that
chronicles
xi
and
xiii
there
is
a
decided
difference
in
the
parentage
of
mother
he
added
curious
on
any
supposition
and
at
one
time
he
had
serious
doubts
as
to
the
authorship
of
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
but
he
was
able
on
various
problematical
points
to
suggest
interesting
solutions
at
first
for
instance
he
could
not
but
be
startled
by
the
cessation
of
miracles
in
the
early
church
but
upon
consideration
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
phenomenon
might
be
accounted
for
by
the
supposition
that
none
but
the
apostles
ever
conferred
miraculous
powers
and
that
therefore
they
ceased
of
course
after
one
generation
nor
did
he
fail
to
base
his
exegesis
whenever
possible
upon
an
appeal
to
general
principles
one
of
his
admirers
points
out
how
arnold
god
command
to
abraham
to
sacrifice
his
son
and
to
the
jews
to
exterminate
the
nations
of
canaan
by
explaining
the
principles
on
which
these
commands
were
given
and
their
reference
to
the
moral
state
of
those
to
whom
they
were
addressed
thereby
educing
light
out
of
darkness
unravelling
the
thread
of
god
religious
education
of
the
human
race
and
holding
up
god
marvellous
counsels
to
the
devout
wonder
and
meditation
of
the
thoughtful
believer
there
was
one
of
his
friends
however
who
did
not
share
this
admiration
for
the
doctor
methods
of
scriptural
interpretation
ward
while
still
a
young
man
at
oxford
had
come
under
his
influence
and
had
been
for
some
time
one
of
his
most
enthusiastic
disciples
but
the
star
of
newman
was
rising
at
the
university
ward
soon
felt
the
attraction
of
that
magnetic
power
and
his
belief
in
his
old
teacher
began
to
waver
it
was
in
particular
arnold
treatment
of
the
scriptures
which
filled
ward
argumentative
mind
at
first
with
distrust
and
at
last
with
positive
antagonism
to
subject
the
bible
to
free
inquiry
to
exercise
upon
it
the
criticism
of
the
individual
judgment
where
might
not
such
methods
lead
who
could
say
that
they
would
not
end
in
socinianism
nay
in
atheism
itself
if
the
text
of
scripture
was
to
be
submitted
to
the
searchings
of
human
reason
how
could
the
question
of
its
inspiration
escape
the
same
tribunal
and
the
proofs
of
revelation
and
even
of
the
existence
of
god
what
human
faculty
was
capable
of
deciding
upon
such
enormous
questions
and
would
not
the
logical
result
be
a
condition
of
universal
doubt
a
very
moderate
computation
ward
argued
times
the
amount
of
a
man
natural
life
might
qualify
a
person
endowed
with
extraordinary
genius
to
have
some
faint
notion
though
even
this
we
doubt
on
which
side
truth
lies
it
was
not
that
he
had
the
slightest
doubt
of
arnold
orthodoxy
arnold
whose
piety
was
universally
recognised
arnold
who
had
held
up
to
scorn
and
execration
strauss
leben
jesu
without
reading
it
what
ward
complained
of
was
the
doctor
lack
of
logic
not
his
lack
of
faith
could
he
not
see
that
if
he
really
carried
out
his
own
principles
to
a
logical
conclusion
he
would
eventually
find
himself
precisely
in
the
arms
of
strauss
the
young
man
whose
personal
friendship
remained
unshaken
determined
upon
an
interview
and
went
down
to
rugby
primed
with
first
principles
syllogisms
and
dilemmas
finding
that
the
headmaster
was
busy
in
school
he
spent
the
afternoon
reading
novels
on
the
sofa
in
the
when
at
last
late
in
the
evening
the
doctor
returned
tired
out
with
his
day
work
ward
fell
upon
him
with
all
his
vigour
the
contest
was
long
and
furious
it
was
also
entirely
inconclusive
when
it
was
over
ward
with
none
of
his
brilliant
arguments
disposed
of
and
none
of
his
probing
questions
satisfactorily
answered
returned
to
the
university
to
plunge
headlong
into
the
vortex
of
the
oxford
movement
and
arnold
worried
perplexed
and
exhausted
went
to
bed
where
he
remained
for
the
next
hours
the
commentary
on
the
new
testament
was
never
finished
and
the
great
work
on
church
and
state
itself
remained
a
fragment
arnold
active
mind
was
diverted
from
political
and
theological
speculations
to
the
study
of
philology
and
to
historical
composition
his
roman
history
which
he
regarded
as
chief
monument
of
his
historical
fame
was
based
partly
upon
the
researches
of
niebuhr
and
partly
upon
an
aversion
to
gibbon
highest
ambition
he
wrote
to
make
my
history
the
very
reverse
of
gibbon
in
this
respect
that
whereas
the
whole
spirit
of
his
work
from
its
low
morality
is
hostile
to
religion
without
speaking
directly
against
it
so
my
greatest
desire
would
be
in
my
history
by
its
high
morals
and
its
general
tone
to
be
of
use
to
the
cause
without
actually
bringing
it
forward
these
efforts
were
rewarded
in
by
the
professorship
of
modern
history
at
oxford
meanwhile
he
was
engaged
in
the
study
of
the
sanskrit
and
slavonic
languages
bringing
out
an
elaborate
edition
of
thucydides
and
carrying
on
a
voluminous
correspondence
upon
a
multitude
of
topics
with
a
large
circle
of
men
of
learning
at
his
death
his
published
works
composed
during
such
intervals
as
he
could
spare
from
the
management
of
a
great
public
school
filled
besides
a
large
number
of
pamphlets
and
articles
no
less
than
seventeen
volumes
it
was
no
wonder
that
carlyle
after
a
visit
to
rugby
should
have
characterised
arnold
as
a
man
of
unresting
diligence
arnold
too
no
doubt
agreed
with
carlyle
during
the
first
eight
years
of
their
married
life
she
bore
him
six
children
and
four
more
were
to
follow
in
this
large
and
growing
domestic
circle
his
hours
of
relaxation
were
spent
there
those
who
had
only
known
him
in
his
professional
capacity
were
surprised
to
find
him
displaying
the
tenderness
and
jocosity
of
a
parent
the
dignified
and
stern
headmaster
was
actually
seen
to
dandle
infants
and
to
caracole
upon
the
hearthrug
on
all
fours
yet
we
are
told
sense
of
his
authority
as
a
father
was
never
lost
in
his
playfulness
as
a
companion
on
more
serious
occasions
the
voice
of
the
spiritual
teacher
sometimes
made
itself
heard
an
intimate
friend
described
how
a
comparison
having
been
made
in
his
family
circle
which
seemed
to
place
paul
above
john
the
tears
rushed
to
the
doctor
eyes
and
how
repeating
one
of
the
verses
from
john
he
begged
that
the
comparison
might
never
again
be
made
the
longer
holidays
were
spent
in
westmorland
where
rambling
with
his
offspring
among
the
mountains
gathering
wild
flowers
and
pointing
out
the
beauties
of
nature
arnold
enjoyed
as
he
himself
would
often
say
almost
awful
happiness
music
he
did
not
appreciate
though
he
occasionally
desired
his
eldest
boy
matthew
to
sing
him
the
confirmation
hymn
of
hinds
to
which
he
had
become
endeared
owing
to
its
use
in
rugby
chapel
but
his
lack
of
ear
was
he
considered
amply
recompensed
by
his
love
of
flowers
are
my
music
he
declared
yet
in
such
a
matter
he
was
careful
to
refrain
from
an
excess
of
feeling
such
as
in
his
opinion
marked
the
famous
lines
of
wordsworth
me
the
meanest
flower
that
blows
can
give
thoughts
that
do
often
lie
too
deep
for
tears
he
found
the
sentiment
morbid
he
said
not
long
enough
to
take
such
intense
interest
in
objects
in
themselves
so
little
as
for
the
animal
world
his
feelings
towards
it
were
of
a
very
different
cast
whole
subject
he
said
the
brute
creation
is
to
me
one
of
such
painful
mystery
that
i
dare
not
approach
it
the
unitarians
themselves
were
a
less
distressing
thought
once
or
twice
he
found
time
to
visit
the
continent
and
the
letters
and
journals
recording
in
minute
detail
his
reflections
and
impressions
in
france
or
italy
show
us
that
arnold
preserved
in
spite
of
the
distractions
of
foreign
scenes
and
foreign
manners
his
accustomed
habits
of
mind
taking
very
little
interest
in
works
of
art
he
was
occasionally
moved
by
the
beauty
of
natural
objects
but
his
principal
preoccupation
remained
with
the
moral
aspects
of
things
from
this
point
of
view
he
found
much
to
reprehend
in
the
conduct
of
his
own
countrymen
fear
he
wrote
our
countrymen
who
live
abroad
are
not
in
the
best
possible
moral
state
however
much
they
may
do
in
science
or
literature
and
this
was
unfortunate
because
thorough
english
gentleman
christian
manly
and
enlightened
is
more
i
believe
than
guizot
or
sismondi
could
comprehend
it
is
a
finer
specimen
of
human
nature
than
any
other
country
i
believe
could
furnish
nevertheless
our
travellers
would
imitate
foreign
customs
without
discrimination
in
the
absurd
habit
of
not
eating
fish
with
a
knife
borrowed
from
the
french
who
do
it
because
they
have
no
knives
fit
for
use
places
no
less
than
people
aroused
similar
reflections
by
pompeii
arnold
was
not
particularly
impressed
is
only
he
observed
same
sort
of
interest
with
which
one
would
see
the
ruins
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
but
indeed
there
is
less
one
is
not
authorised
to
ascribe
so
solemn
a
character
to
the
destruction
of
pompeii
the
lake
of
como
moved
him
more
profoundly
as
he
gazed
upon
the
overwhelming
beauty
around
him
he
thought
of
evil
and
was
appalled
by
the
contrast
the
sense
of
moral
evil
he
prayed
as
strong
in
me
as
my
delight
in
external
beauty
for
in
a
deep
sense
of
moral
evil
more
perhaps
than
in
anything
else
abides
a
saving
knowledge
of
god
his
prayer
was
answered
arnold
was
never
in
any
danger
of
losing
his
sense
of
moral
evil
if
the
landscapes
of
italy
only
served
to
remind
him
of
it
how
could
he
forget
it
among
the
boys
at
rugby
school
the
daily
sight
of
so
many
young
creatures
in
the
hands
of
the
evil
one
filled
him
with
agitated
grief
the
spring
and
activity
of
youth
he
wrote
altogether
unsanctified
by
anything
pure
and
elevated
in
its
desires
it
becomes
a
spectacle
that
is
as
dizzying
and
almost
more
morally
distressing
than
the
shouts
and
gambols
of
a
set
of
lunatics
one
thing
struck
him
as
particularly
strange
is
very
startling
he
said
see
so
much
of
sin
combined
with
so
little
of
sorrow
the
naughtiest
boys
positively
seemed
to
enjoy
themselves
most
there
were
moments
when
he
almost
lost
faith
in
his
whole
system
of
education
when
he
began
to
doubt
whether
some
far
more
radical
reforms
than
any
he
had
attempted
might
not
be
necessary
before
the
multitude
of
children
under
his
charge
shouting
and
gambolling
and
yet
plunged
all
the
while
deep
in
moral
evil
could
ever
be
transformed
into
a
set
of
christian
gentlemen
but
then
he
remembered
his
general
principles
the
conduct
of
jehovah
with
the
chosen
people
and
the
childhood
of
the
human
race
no
it
was
for
him
to
make
himself
as
one
of
his
pupils
afterwards
described
him
in
the
words
of
bacon
to
god
in
spirit
he
would
rule
the
school
majestically
from
on
high
he
would
deliver
a
series
of
sermons
analysing
six
vices
by
which
schools
were
corrupted
and
changed
from
the
likeness
of
god
temple
to
that
of
a
den
of
thieves
he
would
exhort
he
would
denounce
he
would
sweep
through
the
corridors
he
would
turn
the
pages
of
facciolati
lexicon
more
imposingly
than
ever
and
the
rest
he
would
leave
to
the
praepostors
in
the
sixth
form
upon
the
boys
in
the
sixth
form
indeed
a
strange
burden
would
seem
to
have
fallen
arnold
himself
was
very
well
aware
of
this
can
not
deny
he
told
them
in
a
sermon
you
have
an
anxious
duty
a
duty
which
some
might
suppose
was
too
heavy
for
your
years
and
every
term
he
pointed
out
to
them
in
a
short
address
the
responsibilities
of
their
position
and
impressed
upon
them
enormous
influence
they
possessed
good
or
for
evil
nevertheless
most
youths
of
seventeen
in
spite
of
the
warnings
of
their
elders
have
a
singular
trick
of
carrying
moral
burdens
lightly
the
doctor
might
preach
and
look
grave
but
young
brooke
was
ready
enough
to
preside
at
a
fight
behind
the
chapel
though
he
was
in
the
sixth
and
knew
that
fighting
was
against
the
rules
at
their
best
it
may
be
supposed
that
the
praepostors
administered
a
kind
of
barbaric
justice
but
they
were
not
always
at
their
best
and
the
pages
of
tom
brown
schooldays
show
us
what
was
no
doubt
the
normal
condition
of
affairs
under
arnold
when
the
boys
in
the
sixth
form
were
weak
or
brutal
and
the
blackguard
flashman
in
the
intervals
of
swigging
with
his
boon
companions
amused
himself
by
toasting
fags
before
the
fire
but
there
was
an
exceptional
kind
of
boy
upon
whom
the
exhortations
of
arnold
produced
a
very
different
effect
a
minority
of
susceptible
and
serious
youths
fell
completely
under
his
sway
responded
like
wax
to
the
pressure
of
his
influence
and
moulded
their
whole
lives
with
passionate
reverence
upon
the
teaching
of
their
adored
master
conspicuous
among
these
was
arthur
clough
having
been
sent
to
rugby
at
the
age
of
ten
he
quickly
entered
into
every
phase
of
school
life
though
we
are
told
weakness
in
his
ankles
prevented
him
from
taking
a
prominent
part
in
the
games
of
the
place
at
the
age
of
sixteen
he
was
in
the
sixth
form
and
not
merely
a
praepostor
but
head
of
the
school
house
never
did
arnold
have
an
apter
pupil
this
earnest
adolescent
with
the
weak
ankles
and
the
solemn
face
lived
entirely
with
the
highest
ends
in
view
he
thought
of
nothing
but
moral
good
moral
evil
moral
influence
and
moral
responsibility
some
of
his
early
letters
have
been
preserved
and
they
reveal
both
the
intensity
with
which
he
felt
the
importance
of
his
own
position
and
the
strange
stress
of
spirit
under
which
he
laboured
have
been
in
one
continued
state
of
excitement
for
at
least
the
last
three
years
he
wrote
when
he
was
not
yet
seventeen
now
comes
the
time
of
exhaustion
but
he
did
not
allow
himself
to
rest
and
a
few
months
later
he
was
writing
to
a
schoolfellow
as
follows
verily
believe
my
whole
being
is
soaked
through
with
the
wishing
and
hoping
and
striving
to
do
the
school
good
or
rather
to
keep
it
up
and
hinder
it
from
falling
in
this
i
do
think
very
critical
time
so
that
my
cares
and
affections
and
conversations
thoughts
words
and
deeds
look
to
that
in
voluntarily
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
inclined
to
think
this
cant
and
i
am
conscious
that
even
one
truest
feelings
if
very
frequently
put
out
in
the
light
do
make
a
bad
and
disagreeable
appearance
but
this
however
is
true
and
even
if
i
am
carrying
it
too
far
i
do
not
think
it
has
made
me
really
forgetful
of
my
personal
friends
such
as
in
particular
gell
and
burbidge
and
walrond
and
yourself
my
dear
simpkinson
perhaps
it
was
not
surprising
that
a
young
man
brought
up
in
such
an
atmosphere
should
have
fallen
a
prey
at
oxford
to
the
frenzies
of
religious
controversy
that
he
should
have
been
driven
almost
out
of
his
wits
by
the
ratiocinations
of
ward
that
he
should
have
lost
his
faith
that
he
should
have
spent
the
rest
of
his
existence
lamenting
that
loss
both
in
prose
and
verse
and
that
he
should
have
eventually
succumbed
conscientiously
doing
up
brown
paper
parcels
for
florence
nightingale
in
the
earlier
years
of
his
headmastership
arnold
had
to
face
a
good
deal
of
opposition
his
advanced
religious
views
were
disliked
and
there
were
many
parents
to
whom
his
system
of
school
government
did
not
commend
itself
but
in
time
this
hostility
melted
away
succeeding
generations
of
favourite
pupils
began
to
spread
his
fame
through
the
universities
at
oxford
especially
men
were
profoundly
impressed
by
the
pious
aims
of
the
boys
from
rugby
it
was
a
new
thing
to
see
undergraduates
going
to
chapel
more
often
than
they
were
obliged
and
visiting
the
good
poor
their
reverent
admiration
for
arnold
was
no
less
remarkable
whenever
two
of
his
old
pupils
met
they
joined
in
his
praises
and
the
sight
of
his
picture
had
been
known
to
call
forth
from
one
who
had
not
even
reached
the
sixth
exclamations
of
rapture
lasting
for
ten
minutes
and
filling
with
astonishment
the
young
men
from
other
schools
who
happened
to
be
present
he
became
a
celebrity
he
became
at
last
a
great
man
rugby
prospered
its
numbers
rose
higher
than
ever
before
and
after
thirteen
years
as
headmaster
arnold
began
to
feel
that
his
work
there
was
accomplished
and
that
he
might
look
forward
either
to
other
labours
or
perhaps
to
a
dignified
retirement
but
it
was
not
to
be
his
father
had
died
suddenly
at
the
age
of
from
angina
pectoris
and
he
himself
was
haunted
by
forebodings
of
an
early
death
to
be
snatched
away
without
a
warning
to
come
in
a
moment
from
the
seductions
of
this
world
to
the
presence
of
eternity
his
most
ordinary
actions
the
most
casual
remarks
served
to
keep
him
in
remembrance
of
that
dreadful
possibility
when
one
of
his
little
boys
clapped
his
hands
at
the
thought
of
the
approaching
holidays
the
doctor
gently
checked
him
and
repeated
the
story
of
his
own
early
childhood
how
his
own
father
had
made
him
read
aloud
a
sermon
on
the
text
not
thyself
of
tomorrow
and
how
within
the
week
his
father
was
dead
on
the
title
page
of
his
volume
of
sermons
he
was
always
careful
to
write
the
date
of
its
commencement
leaving
a
blank
for
that
of
its
completion
one
of
his
children
asked
him
the
meaning
of
this
is
one
of
the
most
solemn
things
i
do
he
replied
write
the
beginning
of
that
sentence
and
think
that
i
may
perhaps
not
live
to
finish
it
it
was
noticed
that
in
the
spring
of
such
thoughts
seemed
to
be
even
more
frequently
in
his
mind
than
usual
he
was
only
in
his
year
but
he
dwelt
darkly
on
the
fragility
of
human
existence
towards
the
end
of
may
he
began
to
keep
a
diary
a
private
memorandum
of
his
intimate
communings
with
the
almighty
here
evening
after
evening
in
the
traditional
language
of
religious
devotion
he
humbled
himself
before
god
prayed
for
strength
and
purity
and
threw
himself
upon
the
mercy
of
the
most
high
day
and
another
month
succeed
he
wrote
on
may
god
keep
my
mind
and
heart
fixed
on
him
and
cleanse
me
from
all
sin
i
would
wish
to
keep
a
watch
over
my
tongue
as
to
vehement
speaking
and
censuring
of
others
i
would
desire
to
remember
my
latter
end
to
which
i
am
approaching
may
god
keep
me
in
the
hour
of
death
through
jesus
christ
and
preserve
me
from
every
fear
as
well
as
from
presumption
on
june
he
wrote
the
day
is
over
and
i
am
going
to
rest
oh
lord
preserve
me
this
night
and
strengthen
me
to
bear
whatever
thou
shalt
see
fit
to
lay
on
me
whether
pain
sickness
danger
or
distress
on
sunday
june
the
reading
of
the
newspaper
aroused
and
solemn
reflections
much
of
sin
and
so
much
of
suffering
in
the
world
as
are
there
displayed
and
no
one
seems
able
to
remedy
either
and
then
the
thought
of
my
own
private
life
so
full
of
comforts
is
very
startling
he
was
puzzled
but
he
concluded
with
a
prayer
i
be
kept
humble
and
zealous
and
may
god
give
me
grace
to
labour
in
my
generation
for
the
good
of
my
brethren
and
for
his
glory
the
end
of
the
term
was
approaching
and
to
all
appearance
the
doctor
was
in
excellent
spirits
on
june
after
a
hard
day
work
he
spent
the
evening
with
a
friend
in
the
discussion
of
various
topics
upon
which
he
often
touched
in
his
conversation
the
comparison
of
the
art
of
medicine
in
barbarous
and
civilised
ages
the
philological
importance
of
provincial
vocabularies
and
the
threatening
prospect
of
the
moral
condition
of
the
united
states
left
alone
he
turned
to
his
diary
day
after
tomorrow
he
wrote
my
birthday
if
i
am
permitted
to
live
to
see
it
my
birthday
since
my
birth
how
large
a
portion
of
my
life
on
earth
is
already
passed
and
then
what
is
to
follow
this
life
how
visibly
my
outward
work
seems
contracting
and
softening
away
into
the
gentler
employments
of
old
age
in
one
sense
how
nearly
can
i
now
say
vivi
and
i
thank
god
that
as
far
as
ambition
is
concerned
it
is
i
trust
fully
mortified
i
have
no
desire
other
than
to
step
back
from
my
present
place
in
the
world
and
not
to
rise
to
a
higher
still
there
are
works
which
with
god
permission
i
would
do
before
the
night
cometh
arnold
was
thinking
of
his
great
work
on
church
and
state
early
next
morning
he
awoke
with
a
sharp
pain
in
his
chest
the
pain
increasing
a
physician
was
sent
for
and
in
the
meantime
arnold
read
aloud
to
her
husband
the
psalm
upon
one
of
their
boys
coming
into
the
room
son
thank
god
for
me
said
arnold
and
as
the
boy
did
not
at
once
catch
his
meaning
he
added
god
tom
for
giving
me
this
pain
i
have
suffered
so
little
pain
in
my
life
that
i
feel
it
is
very
good
for
me
now
god
has
given
it
to
me
and
i
do
so
thank
him
for
it
then
arnold
read
from
the
the
of
the
sick
her
husband
listening
with
deep
attention
and
assenting
with
an
emphatic
at
the
end
of
many
of
the
sentences
when
the
physician
arrived
he
perceived
at
once
the
gravity
of
the
case
it
was
an
attack
of
angina
pectoris
he
began
to
prepare
some
laudanum
while
arnold
went
out
to
fetch
the
children
all
at
once
as
the
medical
man
was
bending
over
his
glasses
there
was
a
rattle
from
the
bed
a
convulsive
struggle
followed
and
when
the
unhappy
woman
with
the
children
and
all
the
servants
rushed
into
the
room
arnold
had
passed
from
his
perplexities
forever
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
what
he
had
achieved
justified
the
prediction
of
the
provost
of
oriel
that
he
would
the
face
of
education
all
through
the
public
schools
of
england
it
is
true
that
so
far
as
the
actual
machinery
of
education
was
concerned
arnold
not
only
failed
to
effect
a
change
but
deliberately
adhered
to
the
old
system
the
monastic
and
literary
conceptions
of
education
which
had
their
roots
in
the
middle
ages
and
had
been
accepted
and
strengthened
at
the
revival
of
learning
he
adopted
almost
without
hesitation
under
him
the
public
school
remained
in
essentials
a
conventional
establishment
devoted
to
the
teaching
of
greek
and
latin
grammar
had
he
set
on
foot
reforms
in
these
directions
it
seems
probable
that
he
might
have
succeeded
in
carrying
the
parents
of
england
with
him
the
moment
was
ripe
there
was
a
general
desire
for
educational
changes
and
arnold
great
reputation
could
hardly
have
been
resisted
as
it
was
he
threw
the
whole
weight
of
his
influence
into
the
opposite
scale
and
the
ancient
system
became
more
firmly
established
than
ever
the
changes
which
he
did
effect
were
of
a
very
different
nature
by
introducing
morals
and
religion
into
his
scheme
of
education
he
altered
the
whole
atmosphere
of
life
henceforward
the
old
which
was
typified
by
the
regime
of
keate
at
eton
became
impossible
after
arnold
no
public
school
could
venture
to
ignore
the
virtues
of
respectability
again
by
his
introduction
of
the
prefectorial
system
arnold
produced
effects
effects
which
he
himself
perhaps
would
have
found
perplexing
in
his
day
when
the
school
hours
were
over
the
boys
were
free
to
enjoy
themselves
as
they
liked
to
bathe
to
fish
to
ramble
for
long
afternoons
in
the
country
collecting
eggs
or
gathering
flowers
taste
of
the
boys
at
this
period
writes
an
old
rugbaean
who
had
been
under
arnold
strongly
towards
flowers
the
words
have
an
odd
look
today
modern
reader
of
tom
brown
schooldays
searches
in
vain
for
any
reference
to
compulsory
games
house
colours
or
cricket
averages
in
those
days
when
boys
played
games
they
played
them
for
pleasure
but
in
those
days
the
prefectorial
system
the
system
which
hands
over
the
life
of
a
school
to
an
oligarchy
of
a
dozen
youths
of
seventeen
was
still
in
its
infancy
and
had
not
yet
borne
its
fruit
teachers
and
prophets
have
strange
and
that
of
arnold
has
been
no
exception
the
earnest
enthusiast
who
strove
to
make
his
pupils
christian
gentlemen
and
who
governed
his
school
according
to
the
principles
of
the
old
testament
has
proved
to
be
the
founder
of
the
worship
of
athletics
and
the
worship
of
good
form
upon
those
two
poles
our
public
schools
have
turned
for
so
long
that
we
have
almost
come
to
believe
that
such
is
their
essential
nature
and
that
an
english
public
schoolboy
who
wears
the
wrong
clothes
and
takes
no
interest
in
football
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
yet
it
was
not
so
before
arnold
will
it
always
be
so
after
him

passages
in
a
wandering
life
the
end
of
general
gordon
during
the
year
a
solitary
english
gentleman
was
to
be
seen
wandering
with
a
thick
book
under
his
arm
in
the
neighbourhood
of
jerusalem
his
unassuming
figure
short
and
slight
with
its
motion
gave
him
a
boyish
aspect
which
contrasted
oddly
but
not
unpleasantly
with
the
touch
of
grey
on
his
hair
and
whiskers
there
was
the
same
contrast
enigmatic
and
attractive
between
the
sunburnt
complexion
the
hue
of
the
seasoned
traveller
and
the
large
blue
eyes
with
their
look
of
almost
childish
sincerity
to
the
friendly
inquirer
he
would
explain
in
a
row
soft
and
very
distinct
voice
that
he
was
engaged
in
elucidating
four
questions
the
site
of
the
crucifixion
the
line
of
division
between
the
tribes
of
benjamin
and
judah
the
identification
of
gideon
and
the
position
of
the
garden
of
eden
he
was
also
he
would
add
most
anxious
to
discover
the
spot
where
the
ark
first
touched
ground
after
the
subsidence
of
the
flood
he
believed
indeed
that
he
had
solved
that
problem
as
a
reference
to
some
passages
in
the
book
which
he
was
carrying
would
show
this
singular
person
was
general
gordon
and
his
book
was
the
holy
bible
in
such
complete
retirement
from
the
world
and
the
ways
of
men
it
might
have
seemed
that
a
life
of
inordinate
activity
had
found
at
last
a
final
peacefulness
for
month
after
month
for
an
entire
year
the
general
lingered
by
the
banks
of
the
jordan
but
then
the
enchantment
was
suddenly
broken
once
more
adventure
claimed
him
he
plunged
into
the
whirl
of
high
affairs
his
fate
was
mingled
with
the
frenzies
of
empire
and
the
doom
of
peoples
and
it
was
not
in
peace
and
rest
but
in
ruin
and
horror
that
he
reached
his
end
the
circumstances
of
that
tragic
history
so
famous
so
bitterly
debated
so
often
and
so
controversially
described
remain
full
of
suggestion
for
the
curious
examiner
of
the
past
there
emerges
from
those
obscure
unhappy
records
an
interest
not
merely
political
and
historical
but
human
and
dramatic
one
catches
a
vision
of
strange
characters
moved
by
mysterious
impulses
interacting
in
queer
complication
and
hurrying
at
last
so
it
almost
seems
like
creatures
in
a
puppet
show
to
a
predestined
catastrophe
the
characters
too
have
a
charm
of
their
own
they
are
curiously
english
what
other
nation
on
the
face
of
the
earth
could
have
produced
gladstone
and
sir
evelyn
baring
and
lord
hartington
and
general
gordon
alike
in
their
emphasis
and
their
lack
of
emphasis
in
their
eccentricity
and
their
conventionality
in
their
and
their
romance
these
four
figures
seem
to
embody
the
mingling
contradictions
of
the
english
spirit
as
for
the
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
but
first
let
us
glance
at
the
earlier
adventures
of
the
hero
of
the
piece
charles
george
gordon
was
born
in
his
father
of
highland
and
military
descent
was
himself
a
his
mother
came
of
a
family
of
merchants
distinguished
for
their
sea
voyages
into
remote
regions
of
the
globe
as
a
boy
charlie
was
remarkable
for
his
high
spirits
pluck
and
love
of
mischief
destined
for
the
artillery
he
was
sent
to
the
academy
at
woolwich
where
some
other
characteristics
made
their
appearance
on
one
occasion
when
the
cadets
had
been
forbidden
to
leave
the
and
the
senior
corporal
stood
with
outstretched
arms
in
the
doorway
to
prevent
their
exit
charlie
gordon
put
his
head
down
and
butting
the
officer
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
projected
him
down
a
flight
of
stairs
and
through
a
glass
door
at
the
bottom
for
this
act
of
insubordination
he
was
nearly
dismissed
while
the
captain
of
his
company
predicted
that
he
would
never
make
an
officer
a
little
later
when
he
was
eighteen
it
came
to
the
knowledge
of
the
authorities
that
bullying
was
rife
at
the
academy
the
were
questioned
and
one
of
them
said
that
charlie
gordon
had
hit
him
over
the
head
with
a
he
had
worked
well
and
his
record
was
on
the
whole
a
good
one
but
the
authorities
took
a
serious
view
of
the
case
and
held
back
his
commission
for
six
months
it
was
owing
to
this
delay
that
he
went
into
the
royal
engineers
instead
of
the
royal
artillery
he
was
sent
to
pembroke
to
work
at
the
erection
of
fortifications
and
at
pembroke
those
religious
convictions
which
never
afterwards
left
him
first
gained
a
hold
upon
his
mind
under
the
influence
of
his
sister
augusta
and
of
a
religious
captain
of
the
name
of
drew
he
began
to
reflect
upon
his
sins
look
up
texts
and
hope
for
salvation
though
he
had
never
been
confirmed
he
never
was
confirmed
he
took
the
sacrament
every
sunday
and
he
eagerly
perused
the
priceless
diamond
scott
commentaries
and
the
remains
of
the
rev
mccheyne
novels
or
worldly
books
he
wrote
to
his
sister
up
to
the
commentaries
of
scott
i
remember
well
when
you
used
to
get
them
in
numbers
and
i
used
to
laugh
at
them
but
thank
god
it
is
different
with
me
now
i
feel
much
happier
and
more
contented
than
i
used
to
do
i
did
not
like
pembroke
but
now
i
would
not
wish
for
any
prettier
place
i
have
got
a
horse
and
gig
and
drew
and
myself
drive
all
about
the
country
i
hope
my
dear
father
and
mother
think
of
eternal
things
dearest
augusta
pray
for
me
i
beg
of
you
he
was
the
crimean
war
broke
out
and
before
the
year
was
over
he
had
managed
to
get
himself
transferred
to
balaclava
during
the
siege
of
sebastopol
he
behaved
with
conspicuous
gallantry
upon
the
declaration
of
peace
he
was
sent
to
bessarabia
to
assist
in
determining
the
frontier
between
russia
and
turkey
in
accordance
with
the
treaty
of
paris
and
upon
this
duty
he
was
occupied
for
nearly
two
years
not
long
after
his
return
home
in
war
was
declared
upon
china
captain
gordon
was
dispatched
to
the
scene
of
operations
but
the
fighting
was
over
before
he
arrived
nevertheless
he
was
to
remain
for
the
next
four
years
in
china
where
he
was
to
lay
the
foundations
of
extraordinary
renown
though
he
was
too
late
to
take
part
in
the
capture
of
the
taku
forts
he
was
in
time
to
witness
the
destruction
of
the
summer
palace
at
peking
the
act
by
which
lord
elgin
in
the
name
of
european
civilisation
took
vengeance
upon
the
barbarism
of
the
east
the
war
was
over
but
the
british
army
remained
in
the
country
until
the
payment
of
an
indemnity
by
the
chinese
government
was
completed
a
camp
was
formed
at
tientsin
and
gordon
was
occupied
in
setting
up
huts
for
the
troops
while
he
was
thus
engaged
he
had
a
slight
attack
of
smallpox
am
glad
to
say
he
told
his
sister
this
disease
has
brought
me
back
to
my
saviour
and
i
trust
in
future
to
be
a
better
christian
than
i
have
been
hitherto
curiously
enough
a
similar
circumstance
had
more
than
twenty
years
earlier
brought
about
a
singular
succession
of
events
which
were
now
upon
the
point
of
opening
the
way
to
gordon
first
great
adventure
in
a
village
schoolmaster
near
canton
had
been
attacked
by
illness
and
as
in
the
case
of
gordon
illness
had
been
followed
by
a
religious
revulsion
for
such
was
his
name
saw
visions
went
into
ecstasies
and
entered
into
relations
with
the
deity
shortly
afterwards
he
fell
in
with
a
methodist
missionary
from
america
who
instructed
him
in
the
christian
religion
the
new
doctrine
working
upon
the
mystical
ferment
already
in
hong
mind
produced
a
remarkable
result
he
was
he
declared
the
prophet
of
god
he
was
more
he
was
the
son
of
god
he
was
tien
wang
the
celestial
king
he
was
the
younger
brother
of
jesus
the
times
were
propitious
and
proselytes
soon
gathered
around
him
having
conceived
a
grudge
against
the
government
owing
to
his
failure
in
an
examination
hong
gave
a
political
turn
to
his
teaching
which
soon
developed
into
a
propaganda
of
rebellion
against
the
rule
of
the
manchus
and
the
mandarins
the
authorities
took
fright
attempted
to
suppress
hong
by
force
and
failed
the
movement
spread
by
the
rebels
were
overrunning
the
populous
and
flourishing
delta
of
the
yangtse
kiang
and
had
become
a
formidable
force
in
they
captured
nankin
which
was
henceforth
their
capital
the
tien
wang
established
himself
in
a
splendid
palace
and
proclaimed
his
new
evangel
his
theogony
included
the
wife
of
god
or
the
celestial
mother
the
wife
of
jesus
or
the
celestial
and
a
sister
of
jesus
whom
he
married
to
one
of
his
lieutenants
who
thus
became
the
celestial
the
holy
ghost
however
was
eliminated
his
mission
was
to
root
out
demons
and
manchus
from
the
face
of
the
earth
and
to
establish

the
reign
of
eternal
peace

the
meantime
retiring
into
the
depths
of
his
palace
he
left
the
further
conduct
of
earthly
operations
to
his
lieutenants
upon
whom
he
bestowed
the
title
of
kings
while
he
himself
surrounded
by
thirty
wives
and
one
hundred
concubines
devoted
his
energies
to
the
spiritual
side
of
his
mission
the
taiping
rebellion
as
it
came
to
be
called
had
now
reached
its
furthest
extent
the
rebels
were
even
able
to
occupy
for
more
than
a
year
the
city
of
shanghai
but
then
the
tide
turned
the
latent
forces
of
the
empire
gradually
asserted
themselves
the
rebels
lost
ground
their
armies
were
defeated
and
in
nankin
itself
was
besieged
and
the
celestial
king
trembled
in
his
palace
the
end
seemed
to
be
at
hand
when
there
was
a
sudden
twist
of
fortune
wheel
the
war
of
the
invasion
of
china
by
european
armies
their
march
into
the
interior
and
their
occupation
of
peking
not
only
saved
the
rebels
from
destruction
but
allowed
them
to
recover
the
greater
part
of
what
they
had
lost
once
more
they
seized
upon
the
provinces
of
the
delta
once
more
they
menaced
shanghai
it
was
clear
that
the
imperial
army
was
incompetent
and
the
shanghai
merchants
determined
to
provide
for
their
own
safety
as
best
they
could
they
accordingly
got
together
a
body
of
troops
partly
chinese
and
partly
european
and
under
european
officers
to
which
they
entrusted
the
defence
of
the
town
this
small
force
which
after
a
few
preliminary
successes
received
from
the
chinese
government
the
title
of
the
victorious
army
was
able
to
hold
the
rebels
at
bay
but
it
could
do
no
more
for
two
years
shanghai
was
in
constant
danger
the
taipings
steadily
growing
in
power
were
spreading
destruction
far
and
wide
the
ever
victorious
army
was
the
only
force
capable
of
opposing
them
and
the
ever
victorious
army
was
defeated
more
often
than
not
its
first
european
leader
had
been
killed
his
successor
quarrelled
with
the
chinese
governor
li
hung
chang
and
was
dismissed
at
last
it
was
determined
to
ask
the
general
at
the
head
of
the
british
army
of
occupation
for
the
loan
of
an
officer
to
command
the
force
the
english
who
had
been
at
first
inclined
to
favour
the
taipings
on
religious
grounds
were
now
convinced
on
practical
grounds
of
the
necessity
of
suppressing
them
it
was
in
these
circumstances
that
early
in
the
command
of
the
ever
victorious
army
was
offered
to
gordon
he
accepted
it
received
the
title
of
general
from
the
chinese
authorities
and
entered
forthwith
upon
his
new
task
he
was
just
thirty
in
eighteen
months
he
told
li
hung
chang
the
business
would
be
finished
and
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
the
difficulties
before
him
were
very
great
a
vast
tract
of
country
was
in
the
possession
of
the
rebels
an
area
at
the
lowest
estimate
of
square
miles
with
a
population
of
for
centuries
this
plain
of
the
yangtse
delta
rich
in
silk
and
tea
fertilised
by
elaborate
irrigation
and
covered
with
great
walled
cities
had
been
one
of
the
most
flourishing
districts
in
china
though
it
was
now
being
rapidly
ruined
by
the
depredations
of
the
taipings
its
strategic
strength
was
obviously
enormous
gordon
however
with
the
eye
of
a
born
general
perceived
that
he
could
convert
the
very
feature
of
the
country
which
on
the
face
of
it
most
favoured
an
army
on
the
defence
its
complicated
geographical
system
of
interlacing
roads
and
waterways
canals
lakes
and
rivers
into
a
means
of
offensive
warfare
the
force
at
his
disposal
was
small
but
it
was
mobile
he
had
a
passion
for
and
had
already
in
his
leisure
hours
made
a
careful
survey
of
the
country
round
shanghai
he
was
thus
able
to
execute
a
series
of
manoeuvres
which
proved
fatal
to
the
enemy
by
swift
marches
and
by
sudden
attacks
and
surprises
above
all
by
the
dispatch
of
armed
steamboats
up
the
circuitous
waterways
into
positions
from
which
they
could
fall
upon
the
enemy
in
reverse
he
was
able
gradually
to
force
back
the
rebels
to
cut
them
off
piecemeal
in
the
field
and
to
seize
upon
their
cities
but
brilliant
as
these
operations
were
military
genius
showed
itself
no
less
unmistakably
in
other
directions
the
ever
victorious
army
recruited
from
the
of
shanghai
was
an
body
of
about
three
thousand
men
constantly
on
the
verge
of
mutiny
supporting
itself
on
plunder
and
at
the
slightest
provocation
melting
into
thin
air
gordon
by
sheer
force
of
character
established
over
this
incoherent
mass
of
ruffians
an
extraordinary
ascendancy
he
drilled
them
with
rigid
severity
he
put
them
into
a
uniform
armed
them
systematically
substituted
pay
for
loot
and
was
even
able
at
last
to
introduce
regulations
of
a
sanitary
kind
there
were
some
terrible
scenes
in
which
the
general
alone
faced
the
whole
furious
army
and
quelled
it
scenes
of
rage
desperation
towering
courage
and
summary
execution
eventually
he
attained
an
almost
magical
prestige
walking
at
the
head
of
his
troops
with
nothing
but
a
light
cane
in
his
hand
he
seemed
to
pass
through
every
danger
with
the
scatheless
equanimity
of
a
the
taipings
themselves
were
awed
into
a
strange
reverence
more
than
once
their
leaders
in
a
frenzy
of
fear
and
admiration
ordered
the
not
to
take
aim
at
the
advancing
figure
of
the
faintly
smiling
englishman
it
is
significant
that
gordon
found
it
easier
to
win
battles
and
to
crush
mutineers
than
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
the
chinese
authorities
he
had
to
act
in
cooperation
with
a
large
native
force
and
it
was
only
natural
that
the
general
at
the
head
of
it
should
grow
more
and
more
jealous
and
angry
as
the
englishman
successes
revealed
more
and
more
clearly
his
own
incompetence
at
first
indeed
gordon
could
rely
upon
the
support
of
the
governor
li
flung
chang
experience
of
europeans
had
been
hitherto
limited
to
adventurers
and
gordon
came
as
a
revelation
is
a
direct
blessing
from
heaven
he
noted
in
his
diary
coming
of
this
british
gordon
he
is
superior
in
manner
and
bearing
to
any
of
the
foreigners
whom
i
have
come
into
contact
with
and
does
not
show
outwardly
that
conceit
which
makes
most
of
them
repugnant
in
my
sight
a
few
months
later
after
he
had
accompanied
gordon
on
a
victorious
expedition
the
mandarin
enthusiasm
burst
forth
a
sight
for
tired
eyes
he
wrote
an
elixir
for
a
heavy
heart
to
see
this
splendid
englishman
fight
if
there
is
anything
that
i
admire
nearly
as
much
as
the
superb
scholarship
of
tseng
kuofan
it
is
the
military
qualities
of
this
fine
officer
he
is
a
glorious
fellow
in
his
emotion
li
hung
chang
addressed
gordon
as
his
brother
declaring
that
he
him
worthy
to
fill
the
place
of
the
brother
who
is
departed
could
i
have
said
more
in
all
the
words
of
the
world
then
something
happened
which
impressed
and
mystified
the
sensitive
chinaman
englishman
face
was
first
filled
with
a
deep
pleasure
and
then
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
something
depressing
and
sad
for
the
smile
went
from
his
mouth
and
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
when
he
thanked
me
for
what
i
had
said
can
it
be
that
he
has
or
has
had
some
great
trouble
in
his
life
and
that
he
fights
recklessly
to
forget
it
or
that
death
has
no
terrors
for
him
but
as
time
went
on
li
hung
chang
attitude
began
to
change
gordon
he
notes
in
july
control
his
tongue
even
if
he
lets
his
mind
run
loose
the
englishman
had
accused
him
of
intriguing
with
the
chinese
general
and
of
withholding
money
due
to
the
ever
victorious
army
does
he
not
accord
me
the
honours
that
are
due
to
me
as
head
of
the
military
and
civil
authority
in
these
parts
by
september
the
governor
earlier
transports
have
been
replaced
by
a
more
judicial
frame
of
mind
his
many
faults
his
pride
his
temper
and
his
demand
for
money
for
one
is
a
noble
man
and
in
spite
of
all
i
have
said
to
him
or
about
him
i
will
ever
think
most
highly
of
him
he
is
an
honest
man
but
difficult
to
get
on
with
disagreements
of
this
kind
might
perhaps
have
been
tided
over
until
the
end
of
the
campaign
but
an
unfortunate
incident
suddenly
led
to
a
more
serious
quarrel
gordon
advance
had
been
fiercely
contested
but
it
had
been
constant
he
had
captured
several
important
towns
and
in
october
he
laid
siege
to
the
city
of
once
one
of
the
most
famous
and
splendid
in
china
in
december
its
fall
being
obviously
imminent
the
taiping
leaders
agreed
to
surrender
it
on
condition
that
their
lives
were
spared
gordon
was
a
party
to
the
agreement
and
laid
special
stress
upon
his
presence
with
the
imperial
forces
as
a
pledge
of
its
fulfilment
no
sooner
however
was
the
city
surrendered
than
the
rebel
were
assassinated
in
his
fury
it
is
said
that
gordon
searched
everywhere
for
li
hung
chang
with
a
loaded
pistol
in
his
hand
he
was
convinced
of
the
complicity
of
the
governor
who
on
his
side
denied
that
he
was
responsible
for
what
had
happened
asked
him
why
i
should
plot
and
go
around
a
mountain
when
a
mere
order
written
with
five
strokes
of
the
quill
would
have
accomplished
the
same
thing
he
did
not
answer
but
he
insulted
me
and
said
he
would
report
my
treachery
as
he
called
it
to
shanghai
and
england
let
him
do
so
he
can
not
bring
the
crazy
wangs
back
the
agitated
mandarin
hoped
to
placate
gordon
by
a
large
gratuity
and
an
imperial
medal
but
the
plan
was
not
successful
gordon
he
writes
upon
me
in
his
angriest
mood
he
repeated
his
former
speeches
about
the
wangs
i
did
not
attempt
to
argue
with
him
he
refused
the
taels
which
i
had
ready
for
him
and
with
an
oath
said
that
he
did
not
want
the
throne
medal
this
is
showing
the
greatest
disrespect
gordon
resigned
his
command
and
it
was
only
with
the
utmost
reluctance
that
he
agreed
at
last
to
resume
it
an
arduous
and
terrible
series
of
operations
followed
but
they
were
successful
and
by
june
the
ever
victorious
army
having
accomplished
its
task
was
disbanded
the
imperial
forces
now
closed
round
nankin
the
last
hopes
of
the
tien
wang
had
vanished
in
the
recesses
of
his
seraglio
the
celestial
king
judging
that
the
time
had
come
for
the
conclusion
of
his
mission
swallowed
gold
leaf
until
he
ascended
to
heaven
in
july
nankin
was
taken
the
remaining
chiefs
were
executed
and
the
rebellion
was
at
an
end
the
chinese
government
gave
gordon
the
highest
rank
in
its
military
hierarchy
and
invested
him
with
the
yellow
jacket
and
the
feather
he
rejected
an
enormous
offer
of
money
but
he
could
not
refuse
a
great
gold
medal
specially
struck
in
his
honour
by
order
of
the
emperor
at
the
end
of
the
year
he
returned
to
england
where
the
conqueror
of
the
taipings
was
made
a
companion
of
the
bath
that
the
english
authorities
should
have
seen
fit
to
recognise
services
by
the
reward
usually
reserved
for
industrious
clerks
was
typical
of
their
attitude
towards
him
until
the
very
end
of
his
career
perhaps
if
he
had
been
ready
to
make
the
most
of
the
wave
of
popularity
which
greeted
him
on
his
return
if
he
had
advertised
his
fame
and
amid
high
circles
played
the
part
of
chinese
gordon
in
a
becoming
manner
the
results
would
have
been
different
but
he
was
by
nature
farouche
his
soul
revolted
against
dinner
parties
and
stiff
shirts
and
the
presence
of
ladies
especially
of
fashionable
ladies
filled
him
with
uneasiness
he
had
besides
a
deeper
dread
of
the
contaminations
and
so
when
he
was
appointed
to
gravesend
to
supervise
the
erection
of
a
system
of
forts
at
the
mouth
of
the
thames
he
remained
there
quietly
for
six
years
and
at
last
was
almost
forgotten
the
forts
which
were
extremely
expensive
and
quite
useless
occupied
his
working
hours
his
leisure
he
devoted
to
acts
of
charity
and
to
religious
contemplation
the
neighbourhood
was
a
one
and
the
kind
colonel
with
his
tripping
step
and
simple
manner
was
soon
a
familiar
figure
in
it
chatting
with
the
seamen
taking
provisions
to
starving
families
or
visiting
some
bedridden
old
woman
to
light
her
fire
he
was
particularly
fond
of
boys
ragged
street
arabs
and
rough
crowded
about
him
they
were
made
free
of
his
house
and
garden
they
visited
him
in
the
evenings
for
lessons
and
advice
he
helped
them
found
them
employment
corresponded
with
them
when
they
went
out
into
the
world
they
were
he
said
his
wangs
it
was
only
by
a
singular
austerity
of
living
that
he
was
able
to
afford
such
a
variety
of
charitable
expenses
the
easy
luxuries
of
his
class
and
station
were
unknown
to
him
his
clothes
verged
upon
the
shabby
and
his
frugal
meals
were
eaten
at
a
table
with
a
drawer
into
which
the
loaf
and
plate
were
quickly
swept
at
the
approach
of
his
poor
visitors
special
occasions
demanded
special
sacrifices
when
during
the
lancashire
famine
a
public
subscription
was
opened
finding
that
he
had
no
ready
money
he
remembered
his
chinese
medal
and
after
effacing
the
inscription
dispatched
it
as
an
anonymous
gift
except
for
his
boys
and
his
paupers
he
lived
alone
in
his
solitude
he
ruminated
upon
the
mysteries
of
the
universe
and
those
religious
tendencies
which
had
already
shown
themselves
now
became
a
fixed
and
dominating
factor
in
his
life
his
reading
was
confined
almost
entirely
to
the
bible
but
the
bible
he
read
and
with
an
untiring
unending
assiduity
there
he
was
convinced
all
truth
was
to
be
found
and
he
was
equally
convinced
that
he
could
find
it
the
doubts
of
philosophers
the
investigations
of
commentators
the
smiles
of
men
of
the
world
the
dogmas
of
churches
such
things
meant
nothing
to
the
colonel
two
facts
alone
were
evident
there
was
the
bible
and
there
was
himself
and
all
that
remained
to
be
done
was
for
him
to
discover
what
were
the
bible
instructions
and
to
act
accordingly
in
order
to
make
this
discovery
it
was
only
necessary
for
him
to
read
the
bible
over
and
over
again
and
therefore
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
did
so
the
faith
that
he
evolved
was
mystical
and
fatalistic
it
was
also
highly
unconventional
his
creed
based
upon
the
narrow
foundations
of
jewish
scripture
eked
out
occasionally
by
some
english
evangelical
manual
was
yet
wide
enough
to
ignore
every
doctrinal
difference
and
even
at
moments
to
transcend
the
bounds
of
christianity
itself
the
just
man
was
he
who
submitted
to
the
will
of
god
and
the
will
of
god
inscrutable
and
absolute
could
be
served
aright
only
by
those
who
turned
away
from
earthly
desires
and
temporal
temptations
to
rest
themselves
upon
the
spirit
human
beings
were
the
transitory
embodiments
of
souls
who
had
existed
through
an
infinite
past
and
would
continue
to
exist
through
an
infinite
future
the
world
was
vanity
the
flesh
was
dust
and
ashes
man
gordon
wrote
to
his
sister
knows
not
the
secret
who
has
not
the
of
god
revealed
to
him
is
like
this
picture
of
a
circle
with
body
and
soul
written
within
it
he
takes
the
promises
and
curses
as
addressed
to
him
as
one
man
and
will
not
hear
of
there
being
any
birth
before
his
natural
birth
in
any
existence
except
with
the
body
he
is
in
the
man
to
whom
the
secret
the
indwelling
of
god
is
revealed
is
like
this
picture
of
a
circle
with
soul
and
body
enclosed
in
two
separate
circles
he
applies
the
promises
to
one
and
the
curses
to
the
other
if
disobedient
which
he
must
be
except
the
soul
is
enabled
by
god
to
rule
he
then
sees
he
is
not
of
this
world
for
when
he
speaks
of
himself
he
quite
disregards
the
body
his
soul
lives
in
which
is
earthly
such
conceptions
are
familiar
enough
in
the
history
of
religious
thought
they
are
those
of
the
hermit
and
the
fakir
and
it
might
have
been
expected
that
when
once
they
had
taken
hold
upon
his
mind
gordon
would
have
been
content
to
lay
aside
the
activities
of
his
profession
and
would
have
relapsed
at
last
into
the
complete
retirement
of
holy
meditation
but
there
were
other
elements
in
his
nature
which
urged
him
towards
a
very
different
course
he
was
no
simple
quietist
he
was
an
english
gentleman
an
officer
a
man
of
energy
and
action
a
lover
of
danger
and
the
audacities
that
defeat
danger
a
passionate
creature
flowing
over
with
the
of
independent
judgment
and
the
arbitrary
temper
of
command
whatever
he
might
find
in
his
it
was
not
for
such
as
he
to
dream
out
his
days
in
devout
obscurity
but
conveniently
enough
he
found
nothing
in
his
indicating
that
he
should
what
he
did
find
was
that
the
will
of
god
was
inscrutable
and
absolute
that
it
was
man
duty
to
follow
where
god
hand
led
and
if
god
hand
led
towards
violent
excitements
and
extraordinary
vicissitudes
that
it
was
not
only
futile
it
was
impious
to
turn
another
way
fatalism
is
always
apt
to
be
a
philosophy
for
while
on
the
one
hand
it
reveals
the
minutest
occurrences
as
the
immutable
result
of
a
rigid
chain
of
infinitely
predestined
causes
on
the
other
it
invests
the
wildest
incoherences
of
conduct
or
of
circumstance
with
the
sanctity
of
eternal
law
and
gordon
fatalism
was
no
exception
the
same
doctrine
that
led
him
to
dally
with
omens
to
search
for
prophetic
texts
and
to
append
in
brackets
the
apotropaic
initials
after
every
statement
in
his
letters
implying
futurity
led
him
also
to
envisage
his
moods
and
his
desires
his
passing
reckless
whims
and
his
deep
unconscious
instincts
as
the
mysterious
manifestations
of
the
indwelling
god
that
there
was
danger
lurking
in
such
a
creed
he
was
very
well
aware
the
grosser
temptations
of
the
world
money
and
the
vulgar
attributes
of
power
had
indeed
no
charms
for
him
but
there
were
subtler
and
more
insinuating
allurements
which
it
was
not
so
easy
to
resist
more
than
one
observer
declared
that
ambition
was
in
reality
the
essential
motive
in
his
life
ambition
neither
for
wealth
nor
titles
but
for
fame
and
influence
for
the
swaying
of
multitudes
and
for
that
kind
of
enlarged
and
intensified
existence
breath
breathes
most
even
in
the
mouths
of
men
was
it
so
in
the
depths
of
gordon
soul
there
were
intertwining
contradictions
intricate
recesses
where
egoism
and
renunciation
melted
into
one
another
where
the
flesh
lost
itself
in
the
spirit
and
the
spirit
in
the
flesh
what
was
the
will
of
god
the
question
which
first
became
insistent
during
his
retirement
at
gravesend
never
afterwards
left
him
it
might
almost
be
said
that
he
spent
the
remainder
of
his
life
in
searching
for
the
answer
to
it
in
all
his
odysseys
in
all
his
strange
and
agitated
adventures
a
day
never
passed
on
which
he
neglected
the
voice
of
eternal
wisdom
as
it
spoke
through
the
words
of
paul
or
solomon
of
jonah
or
habakkuk
he
opened
his
bible
he
read
and
then
he
noted
down
his
reflections
upon
scraps
of
paper
which
periodically
pinned
together
he
dispatched
to
one
or
other
of
his
religious
friends
and
particularly
his
sister
augusta
the
published
extracts
from
these
voluminous
outpourings
lay
bare
the
inner
history
of
gordon
spirit
and
reveal
the
pious
visionary
of
gravesend
in
the
restless
hero
of
three
continents
his
seclusion
came
to
an
end
in
a
distinctly
providential
manner
in
accordance
with
a
stipulation
in
the
treaty
of
paris
an
international
commission
had
been
appointed
to
improve
the
navigation
of
the
danube
and
gordon
who
had
acted
on
a
similar
body
fifteen
years
earlier
was
sent
out
to
represent
great
britain
at
constantinople
he
chanced
to
meet
the
egyptian
minister
nubar
pasha
the
governorship
of
the
equatorial
provinces
of
the
sudan
was
about
to
fall
vacant
and
nubar
offered
the
post
to
gordon
who
accepted
it
some
wise
design
he
wrote
to
his
sister
turns
events
one
way
or
another
whether
man
likes
it
or
not
as
a
man
driving
a
horse
turns
it
to
right
or
left
without
consideration
as
to
whether
the
horse
likes
that
way
or
not
to
be
happy
a
man
must
be
like
a
willing
horse
ready
for
anything
events
will
go
as
god
likes
and
then
followed
six
years
of
extraordinary
desperate
unceasing
and
ungrateful
labour
the
unexplored
and
pestilential
region
of
equatoria
stretching
southwards
to
the
great
lakes
and
the
sources
of
the
nile
had
been
annexed
to
egypt
by
the
khedive
ismail
who
while
he
squandered
his
millions
on
parisian
dreamt
strange
dreams
of
glory
and
empire
those
dim
tracts
of
swamp
and
forest
in
central
africa
were
so
he
declared
to
be
up
they
were
to
receive
the
blessings
of
civilisation
they
were
to
become
a
source
of
eternal
honour
to
himself
and
egypt
the
which
flourished
there
was
to
be
put
down
the
savage
inhabitants
were
to
become
acquainted
with
freedom
justice
and
prosperity
incidentally
a
government
monopoly
in
ivory
was
to
be
established
and
the
place
was
to
be
made
a
paying
concern
ismail
hopelessly
in
debt
to
a
horde
of
european
creditors
looked
to
europe
to
support
him
in
his
schemes
europe
and
in
particular
england
with
her
passion
for
extraneous
philanthropy
was
not
averse
sir
samuel
baker
became
the
first
governor
of
equatoria
and
now
gordon
was
to
carry
on
the
good
work
in
such
circumstances
it
was
only
natural
that
gordon
should
consider
himself
a
special
instrument
in
god
band
to
put
his
disinterestedness
beyond
doubt
he
reduced
his
salary
which
had
been
fixed
at
to
he
took
over
his
new
duties
early
in
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
had
a
first
hint
of
disillusionment
on
his
way
up
the
nile
he
was
received
in
state
at
khartoum
by
the
egyptian
of
the
sudan
his
immediate
official
superior
the
function
ended
in
a
prolonged
banquet
followed
by
a
mixed
ballet
of
soldiers
and
completely
naked
young
women
who
danced
in
a
circle
beat
time
with
their
feet
and
accompanied
their
gestures
with
a
curious
sound
of
clucking
at
last
the
austrian
consul
overcome
by
the
exhilaration
of
the
scene
flung
himself
in
a
frenzy
among
the
dancers
the
shouting
with
delight
seemed
about
to
follow
suit
when
gordon
abruptly
left
the
room
and
the
party
broke
up
in
confusion
when
miles
to
the
southward
gordon
reached
the
seat
of
his
government
and
the
desolation
of
the
tropics
closed
over
him
the
agonising
nature
of
his
task
stood
fully
revealed
for
the
next
three
years
he
struggled
with
enormous
difficulties
with
the
confused
and
horrible
country
the
appalling
climate
the
maddening
insects
and
the
loathsome
diseases
the
indifference
of
subordinates
and
superiors
the
savagery
of
the
and
the
hatred
of
the
inhabitants
one
by
one
the
small
company
of
his
european
staff
succumbed
with
a
few
hundred
egyptian
soldiers
he
had
to
suppress
insurrections
make
roads
establish
fortified
posts
and
enforce
the
government
monopoly
of
ivory
all
this
he
accomplished
he
even
succeeded
in
sending
enough
money
to
cairo
to
pay
for
the
expenses
of
the
expedition
but
a
deep
gloom
had
fallen
upon
his
spirit
when
after
a
series
of
incredible
obstacles
had
been
overcome
a
steamer
was
launched
upon
the
unexplored
albert
nyanza
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
lake
leaving
the
glory
of
its
navigation
to
his
italian
lieutenant

a
practical
proof
of
what
i
think
regarding
the
inordinate
praise
which
is
given
to
an

among
his
distresses
and
he
loathed
the

of
all
such
honours
and

the

snarl

difficult
for
anyone
to
be
circumcised
from
the
world
to
be
as
indifferent
to
its
pleasures
its
sorrows
and
its
comforts
as
a
corpse
is
that
is
to
know
the
resurrection
but
the
holy
bible
was
not
his
only
solace
for
now
under
the
parching
african
sun
we
catch
glimpses
for
the
first
time
of
gordon
hand
stretching
out
towards
stimulants
of
a
more
material
quality
for
months
together
we
are
told
he
would
drink
nothing
but
pure
water
and
then
water
that
was
not
so
pure
in
his
fits
of
melancholy
he
would
shut
himself
up
in
his
tent
for
days
at
a
time
with
a
hatchet
and
a
flag
placed
at
the
door
to
indicate
that
he
was
not
to
be
disturbed
for
any
reason
whatever
until
at
last
the
cloud
would
lift
the
signals
would
be
removed
and
the
governor
would
reappear
brisk
and
cheerful
during
one
of
these
retirements
there
was
grave
danger
of
a
native
attack
upon
the
camp
colonel
long
the
chief
of
staff
ventured
after
some
hesitation
to
ignore
the
flag
and
hatchet
and
to
enter
the
forbidden
tent
he
found
gordon
seated
at
a
table
upon
which
were
an
open
bible
and
an
open
bottle
of
brandy
long
explained
the
circumstances
but
could
obtain
no
answer
beyond
the
abrupt
words
are
commander
of
the
camp
and
was
obliged
to
retire
nonplussed
to
deal
with
the
situation
as
best
he
could
on
the
following
morning
gordon
cleanly
shaven
and
in
the
uniform
of
the
royal
engineers
entered
long
hut
with
his
usual
tripping
step
exclaiming
fellow
now
do
be
angry
with
me
i
was
very
low
last
night
let
have
a
good
breakfast
a
little
and
do
you
feel
up
to
it
and
with
these
veering
moods
and
dangerous
restoratives
there
came
an
intensification
of
the
queer
and
violent
elements
in
the
temper
of
the
man
his
eccentricities
grew
upon
him
he
found
it
more
and
more
uncomfortable
to
follow
the
ordinary
course
official
routine
was
an
agony
to
him
his
caustic
and
satirical
humour
expressed
itself
in
a
style
that
astounded
government
departments
while
he
jibed
at
his
superiors
his
subordinates
learned
to
dread
the
explosions
of
his
wrath
there
were
moments
when
his
passion
became
utterly
ungovernable
and
the
gentle
soldier
of
god
who
had
spent
the
day
in
quoting
texts
for
the
edification
of
his
sister
would
slap
the
face
of
his
arab
in
a
sudden
access
of
fury
or
set
upon
his
alsatian
servant
and
kick
him
until
he
screamed
at
the
end
of
three
years
gordon
resigned
his
post
in
equatoria
and
prepared
to
return
home
but
again
providence
intervened
the
khedive
offered
him
as
an
inducement
to
remain
in
the
egyptian
service
a
position
of
still
higher
consequence
the
of
the
whole
sudan
and
gordon
once
more
took
up
his
task
another
three
years
were
passed
in
grappling
with
vast
revolting
provinces
with
the
ineradicable
iniquities
of
the
and
with
all
the
complications
of
weakness
and
corruption
incident
to
an
oriental
administration
extending
over
almost
boundless
tracts
of
savage
territory
which
had
never
been
effectively
subdued
his
headquarters
were
fixed
in
the
palace
at
khartoum
but
there
were
various
interludes
in
his
government
once
when
the
khedive
finances
had
become
peculiarly
embroiled
he
summoned
gordon
to
cairo
to
preside
over
a
commission
which
should
set
matters
to
rights
gordon
accepted
the
post
but
soon
found
that
his
situation
was
untenable
he
was
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
between
the
unscrupulous
cunning
of
the
egyptian
pashas
and
the
immeasurable
immensity
of
the
khedive
debts
to
his
european
creditors
the
pashas
were
anxious
to
use
him
as
a
respectable
mask
for
their
own
nefarious
dealings
and
the
representatives
of
the
european
creditors
who
looked
upon
him
as
an
irresponsible
intruder
were
anxious
simply
to
get
rid
of
him
as
soon
as
they
could
one
of
these
representatives
was
sir
evelyn
baring
whom
gordon
now
met
for
the
first
time
an
immediate
antagonism
flashed
out
between
the
two
men
but
their
hostility
had
no
time
to
mature
for
gordon
baffled
on
all
sides
and
deserted
even
by
the
khedive
precipitately
returned
to
his
whatever
else
providence
might
have
decreed
it
had
certainly
not
decided
that
he
should
be
a
financier
his
tastes
and
his
talents
were
indeed
of
a
very
different
kind
in
his
absence
a
rebellion
had
broken
out
in
darfur
one
of
the
vast
outlying
provinces
of
his
government
where
a
native
chieftain
zobeir
had
erected
on
a
basis
of
a
dangerous
military
power
zobeir
himself
had
been
lured
to
cairo
where
he
was
detained
in
a
state
of
but
his
son
suleiman
ruled
in
his
stead
and
was
now
defying
the
gordon
determined
upon
a
hazardous
stroke
he
mounted
a
camel
and
rode
alone
in
the
blazing
heat
across
miles
of
desert
to
suleiman
camp
his
sudden
apparition
dumbfounded
the
rebels
his
imperious
bearing
overawed
them
he
signified
to
them
that
in
two
days
they
must
disarm
and
disperse
and
the
whole
host
obeyed
gordon
returned
to
khartoum
in
triumph
but
he
had
not
heard
the
last
of
suleiman
flying
southwards
from
darfur
to
the
neighbouring
province
of
the
young
man
was
soon
once
more
at
the
head
of
a
formidable
force
a
prolonged
campaign
of
extreme
difficulty
and
danger
followed
eventually
gordon
summoned
again
to
cairo
was
obliged
to
leave
to
gessi
the
task
of
finally
crushing
the
revolt
after
a
brilliant
campaign
gessi
forced
suleiman
to
surrender
and
then
shot
him
as
a
rebel
the
deed
was
to
exercise
a
curious
influence
upon
gordon
fate
though
suleiman
had
been
killed
and
his
power
broken
the
still
flourished
in
the
sudan
efforts
to
suppress
it
resembled
the
palliatives
of
an
empiric
treating
the
superficial
symptoms
of
some
profound
constitutional
disease
the
root
of
the
malady
lay
in
the
of
cairo
and
constantinople
the
supply
followed
the
demand
gordon
after
years
of
labour
might
here
and
there
stop
up
a
spring
or
divert
a
tributary
but
somehow
or
other
the
waters
would
reach
the
in
the
end
he
himself
came
to
recognise
this
you
have
got
the
ink
that
has
soaked
into
out
of
it
he
said
slavery
will
cease
in
these
lands
and
yet
he
struggled
desperately
on
it
was
not
for
him
to
murmur
feel
my
own
weakness
and
look
to
him
who
is
almighty
and
i
leave
the
issue
without
inordinate
care
to
him
relief
came
at
last
the
khedive
ismail
was
deposed
and
gordon
felt
at
liberty
to
send
in
his
resignation
before
he
left
egypt
however
he
was
to
experience
yet
one
more
remarkable
adventure
at
his
own
request
he
set
out
on
a
diplomatic
mission
to
the
negus
of
abyssinia
the
mission
was
a
complete
failure
the
negus
was
intractable
and
when
his
bribes
were
refused
furious
gordon
was
ignominiously
dismissed
every
insult
was
heaped
on
him
he
was
arrested
and
obliged
to
traverse
the
abyssinian
mountains
in
the
depth
of
winter
under
the
escort
of
a
savage
troop
of
horse
when
after
great
hardships
and
dangers
he
reached
cairo
he
found
the
whole
official
world
up
in
arms
against
him
the
pashas
had
determined
at
last
that
they
had
no
further
use
for
this
honest
and
peculiar
englishman
it
was
arranged
that
one
of
his
confidential
dispatches
should
be
published
in
the
newspapers
naturally
it
contained
indiscretions
there
was
a
universal
outcry
the
man
was
insubordinate
and
mad
he
departed
under
a
storm
of
obloquy
it
seemed
impossible
that
he
should
ever
return
to
egypt
on
his
way
home
he
stopped
in
paris
saw
the
english
ambassador
lord
lyons
and
speedily
came
into
conflict
with
him
over
egyptian
affairs
there
ensued
a
heated
correspondence
which
was
finally
closed
by
a
letter
from
gordon
ending
as
follows
have
some
comfort
in
thinking
that
in
ten
or
fifteen
years
time
it
will
matter
little
to
either
of
us
a
black
box
six
feet
six
by
three
feet
wide
will
then
contain
all
that
is
left
of
ambassador
or
cabinet
minister
or
of
your
humble
and
obedient
servant
he
arrived
in
england
early
in
ill
and
exhausted
and
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
after
the
terrible
activities
of
his
african
exile
he
would
have
been
ready
to
rest
but
the
very
opposite
was
the
case
the
next
three
years
were
the
most
momentous
of
his
life
he
hurried
from
post
to
post
from
enterprise
to
enterprise
from
continent
to
continent
with
a
vertiginous
rapidity
he
accepted
the
private
secretaryship
to
lord
ripon
the
new
viceroy
of
india
and
three
days
after
his
arrival
at
bombay
he
resigned
he
had
suddenly
realised
that
he
was
not
cut
out
for
a
private
secretary
when
on
an
address
being
sent
in
from
some
deputation
he
was
asked
to
say
that
the
viceroy
had
read
it
with
interest
know
perfectly
he
said
to
lord
william
beresford
lord
ripon
has
never
read
it
and
i
ca
say
that
sort
of
thing
so
i
will
resign
and
you
take
in
my
resignation
he
confessed
to
lord
william
that
the
world
was
not
big
enough
for
him
that
there
was
king
or
country
big
enough
and
then
he
added
hitting
him
on
the
shoulder
that
is
flesh
that
is
what
i
hate
and
what
makes
me
wish
to
die
two
days
later
he
was
off
for
pekin
one
will
say
i
am
mad
were
his
last
words
to
lord
william
beresford
you
say
i
am
not
the
position
in
china
was
critical
war
with
russia
appeared
to
be
imminent
and
gordon
had
been
appealed
to
in
order
to
use
his
influence
on
the
side
of
peace
he
was
welcomed
by
many
old
friends
of
former
days
among
them
li
hung
chang
whose
diplomatic
views
coincided
with
his
own
li
diplomatic
language
however
was
less
unconventional
in
an
interview
with
the
ministers
gordon
expressions
were
such
that
the
interpreter
shook
with
terror
upset
a
cup
of
tea
and
finally
refused
to
translate
the
dreadful
words
upon
which
gordon
snatched
up
a
dictionary
and
with
his
finger
on
the
word
showed
it
to
the
startled
mandarins
a
few
weeks
later
li
hung
chang
was
in
power
and
peace
was
assured
gordon
had
spent
two
and
a
half
days
in
pekin
and
was
whirling
through
china
when
a
telegram
arrived
from
the
home
authorities
who
viewed
his
movements
with
uneasiness
ordering
him
to
return
at
once
to
england
did
not
produce
a
twitter
in
me
he
wrote
to
his
sister
died
long
ago
and
it
will
not
make
any
difference
to
me
i
am
prepared
to
follow
the
unrolling
of
the
scroll
the
world
perhaps
was
not
big
enough
for
him
and
yet
how
clearly
he
recognised
that
he
was
poor
insect
heart
tells
me
that
and
i
am
glad
of
it
on
his
return
to
england
he
telegraphed
to
the
government
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
which
had
become
involved
in
a
war
with
the
basutos
offering
his
services
but
his
telegram
received
no
reply
just
then
sir
howard
elphinstone
was
appointed
to
the
command
of
the
royal
engineers
in
mauritius
it
was
a
thankless
and
insignificant
post
and
rather
than
accept
it
elphinstone
was
prepared
to
retire
from
the
army
unless
some
other
officer
could
be
induced
in
return
for
to
act
as
his
substitute
gordon
who
was
an
old
friend
agreed
to
undertake
the
work
upon
one
condition
that
he
should
receive
nothing
from
elphinstone
and
accordingly
he
spent
the
next
year
in
that
remote
and
unhealthy
island
looking
after
the
barrack
repairs
and
testing
the
drains
while
he
was
thus
engaged
the
cape
government
whose
difficulties
had
been
increasing
changed
its
mind
and
early
in
begged
for
gordon
help
once
more
he
was
involved
in
great
affairs
a
new
field
of
action
opened
before
him
and
then
in
a
moment
there
was
another
shift
of
the
kaleidoscope
and
again
he
was
thrown
upon
the
world
within
a
few
weeks
after
a
violent
quarrel
with
the
cape
authorities
his
mission
had
come
to
an
end
what
should
he
do
next
to
what
remote
corner
or
what
enormous
stage
to
what
drudgeries
or
what
resounding
exploits
would
the
hand
of
god
lead
him
now
he
waited
in
an
odd
hesitation
he
opened
the
bible
but
neither
the
prophecies
of
hosea
nor
the
epistles
to
timothy
gave
him
any
advice
the
king
of
the
belgians
asked
if
he
would
be
willing
to
go
to
the
congo
he
was
perfectly
willing
he
would
go
whenever
the
king
of
the
belgians
sent
for
him
his
services
however
were
not
required
yet
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
he
betook
himself
to
palestine
his
studies
there
were
embodied
in
a
correspondence
with
the
rev
barnes
filling
over
pages
of
manuscript
a
correspondence
which
was
only
put
an
end
to
when
at
last
the
summons
from
the
king
of
the
belgians
came
he
hurried
back
to
england
but
it
was
not
to
the
congo
that
he
was
being
led
by
the
hand
of
god
gordon
last
great
adventure
like
his
first
was
occasioned
by
a
religious
revolt
at
the
very
moment
when
apparently
forever
he
was
shaking
the
dust
of
egypt
from
his
feet
mahommed
ahmed
was
starting
upon
his
extraordinary
career
in
the
sudan
the
time
was
propitious
for
revolutions
the
effete
egyptian
empire
was
hovering
upon
the
verge
of
collapse
the
enormous
territories
of
the
sudan
were
seething
with
discontent
gordon
administration
had
by
its
very
vigour
only
helped
to
precipitate
the
inevitable
disaster
his
attacks
upon
the
his
establishment
of
a
government
monopoly
in
ivory
his
hostility
to
the
egyptian
officials
had
been
so
many
shocks
shaking
to
its
foundations
the
whole
rickety
machine
the
result
of
all
his
efforts
had
been
on
the
one
hand
to
fill
the
most
powerful
classes
in
the
community
the
dealers
in
slaves
and
ivory
with
a
hatred
of
the
government
and
on
the
other
to
awaken
among
the
mass
of
the
inhabitants
a
new
perception
of
the
dishonesty
and
incompetence
of
their
egyptian
masters
when
after
gordon
removal
the
rule
of
the
pashas
once
more
asserted
itself
over
the
sudan
a
general
combustion
became
inevitable
the
first
spark
would
set
off
the
blaze
just
then
it
happened
that
mahommed
ahmed
the
son
of
an
insignificant
priest
in
dongola
having
quarrelled
with
the
sheikh
from
whom
he
was
receiving
religious
instruction
set
up
as
an
independent
preacher
with
his
headquarters
at
abba
island
on
the
nile
miles
above
khartoum
like
he
began
as
a
religious
reformer
and
ended
as
a
rebel
king
it
was
his
mission
he
declared
to
purge
the
true
faith
of
its
worldliness
and
corruptions
to
lead
the
followers
of
the
prophet
into
the
paths
of
chastity
simplicity
and
holiness
with
the
puritanical
zeal
of
a
calvin
be
denounced
junketings
and
merrymakings
songs
and
dances
lewd
living
and
all
the
delights
of
the
flesh
he
fell
into
trances
he
saw
visions
he
saw
the
prophet
and
jesus
and
the
angel
izrail
accompanying
him
and
watching
over
him
forever
he
prophesied
and
performed
miracles
and
his
fame
spread
through
the
land
there
is
an
ancient
tradition
in
the
mohammedan
world
telling
of
a
mysterious
being
the
last
in
succession
of
the
twelve
holy
imams
who
untouched
by
death
and
withdrawn
into
the
recesses
of
a
mountain
was
destined
at
the
appointted
hour
to
come
forth
again
among
men
his
title
was
the
mahdi
the
guide
some
believed
that
he
would
be
the
forerunner
of
the
messiah
others
believed
that
he
would
be
christ
himself
already
various
mahdis
had
made
their
appearance
several
had
been
highly
successful
and
two
in
medieval
times
had
founded
dynasties
in
egypt
but
who
could
tell
whether
all
these
were
not
impostors
might
not
the
twelfth
imam
be
still
waiting
in
mystical
concealment
ready
to
emerge
at
any
moment
at
the
bidding
of
god
there
were
signs
by
which
the
true
mahdi
might
be
recognised
unmistakable
signs
if
one
could
but
read
them
aright
he
must
be
of
the
family
of
the
prophet
he
must
possess
miraculous
powers
of
no
common
kind
and
his
person
must
be
overflowing
with
a
peculiar
sanctity
the
pious
dwellers
beside
those
distant
waters
where
holy
men
by
dint
of
a
constant
repetition
of
one
of
the
names
of
god
secured
the
protection
of
guardian
angels
and
where
groups
of
devotees
shaking
their
heads
with
a
violence
which
would
unseat
the
reason
of
less
athletic
worshippers
attained
to
an
extraordinary
beatitude
heard
with
awe
of
the
young
preacher
whose
saintliness
was
almost
more
than
mortal
and
whose
miracles
brought
amazement
to
the
mind
was
he
not
also
of
the
family
of
the
prophet
he
himself
had
said
so
and
who
would
disbelieve
the
holy
man
when
he
appeared
in
person
every
doubt
was
swept
away
there
was
a
strange
splendour
in
his
presence
an
overpowering
passion
in
the
torrent
of
his
speech
great
was
the
wickedness
of
the
people
and
great
was
their
punishment
surely
their
miseries
were
a
visible
sign
of
the
wrath
of
the
lord
they
had
sinned
and
the
cruel
tax
gatherers
had
come
among
them
and
the
corrupt
governors
and
all
the
oppressions
of
the
egyptians
yet
these
things
should
have
an
end
the
lord
would
raise
up
his
chosen
deliverer
the
hearts
of
the
people
would
be
purified
and
their
enemies
would
be
laid
low
the
accursed
egyptian
would
be
driven
from
the
land
let
the
faithful
take
heart
and
make
ready
how
soon
might
not
the
hour
strike
when
the
twelfth
imam
the
guide
the
mahdi
would
reveal
himself
to
the
world
in
that
hour
the
righteous
triumph
and
the
guilty
be
laid
low
forever
such
was
the
teaching
of
mohammed
ahmed
a
band
of
enthusiastic
disciples
gathered
round
him
eagerly
waiting
for
the
revelation
which
would
crown
their
hopes
at
last
the
moment
came
one
evening
at
abba
island
taking
aside
the
foremost
of
his
followers
the
master
whispered
the
portentous
news
he
was
the
mahdi
the
egyptian
at
khartoum
hearing
that
a
religious
movement
was
afoot
grew
disquieted
and
dispatched
an
emissary
to
abba
island
to
summon
the
impostor
to
his
presence
the
emissary
was
courteously
received
mohammed
ahmed
he
said
must
come
at
once
to
khartoum
exclaimed
the
mahdi
starting
to
his
feet
with
a
strange
look
in
his
eyes
the
look
was
so
strange
that
the
emissary
thought
it
advisable
to
cut
short
the
interview
and
to
return
to
khartoum
thereupon
the
sent
soldiers
to
seize
the
audacious
rebel
by
force
with
his
handful
of
friends
the
mahdi
fell
upon
the
soldiers
and
cut
them
to
pieces
the
news
spread
like
through
the
country
the
mahdi
had
arisen
the
egyptians
were
destroyed
but
it
was
clear
to
the
little
band
of
enthusiasts
at
abba
island
that
their
position
on
the
river
was
no
longer
tenable
the
mahdi
deciding
upon
a
second
hegira
retreated
into
the
depths
of
kordofan
the
retreat
was
a
triumphal
progress
the
country
groaning
under
alien
misgovernment
and
vibrating
with
religious
excitement
suddenly
found
in
this
rebellious
prophet
a
a
hero
a
deliverer
and
now
another
element
was
added
to
the
forces
of
insurrection
the
baggara
tribes
of
kordofan
and
the
most
warlike
and
vigorous
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
sudan
threw
in
their
lot
with
the
mahdi
their
powerful
emirs
still
smarting
from
the
blows
of
gordon
saw
that
the
opportunity
for
revenge
had
come
a
holy
war
was
proclaimed
against
the
egyptian
misbelievers
the
followers
of
the
mahdi
dressed
in
token
of
a
new
austerity
of
living
in
the
or
white
smock
of
coarse
cloth
patched
with
variously
shaped
and
coloured
patches
were
rapidly
organised
into
a
formidable
army
several
attacks
from
khartoum
were
repulsed
and
at
last
the
mahdi
felt
strong
enough
to
advance
against
the
enemy
while
his
lieutenants
led
detachments
into
the
vast
provinces
lying
to
the
west
and
the
south
darfur
and
he
himself
marched
upon
el
obeid
the
capital
of
kordofan
it
was
in
vain
that
reinforcements
were
hurried
from
khartoum
to
the
assistance
of
the
garrison
there
was
some
severe
fighting
the
town
was
completely
cut
off
and
after
a
six
siege
it
surrendered
a
great
quantity
of
guns
and
ammunition
and
in
spices
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
mahdi
he
was
master
of
kordofan
he
was
at
the
head
of
a
great
army
he
was
rich
he
was
worshipped
a
dazzling
future
opened
before
him
no
possibility
seemed
too
remote
no
fortune
too
magnificent
a
vision
of
universal
empire
hovered
before
his
eyes
allah
whose
servant
he
was
who
had
led
him
thus
far
would
lead
him
onward
still
to
the
glorious
end
for
some
months
he
remained
at
el
obeid
consolidating
his
dominion
in
a
series
of
circular
letters
he
described
his
colloquies
with
the
almighty
and
laid
down
the
rule
of
living
which
his
followers
were
to
pursue
the
faithful
under
pain
of
severe
punishment
were
to
return
to
the
ascetic
simplicity
of
ancient
times
a
criminal
code
was
drawn
up
meting
out
executions
mutilations
and
floggings
with
a
barbaric
zeal
the
blasphemer
was
to
be
instantly
hanged
the
adulterer
was
to
be
scourged
with
whips
of
rhinoceros
hide
the
thief
was
to
have
his
right
hand
and
his
left
foot
hacked
off
in
the
marketplace
no
more
were
marriages
to
be
celebrated
with
pomp
and
feasting
no
more
was
the
youthful
warrior
to
swagger
with
flowing
hair
henceforth
the
believer
must
banquet
on
dates
and
milk
and
his
head
must
be
kept
shaved
minor
transgressions
were
punished
by
confiscation
of
property
or
by
imprisonment
and
chains
but
the
rhinoceros
whip
was
the
favourite
instrument
of
chastisement
men
were
flogged
for
drinking
a
glass
of
wine
they
were
flogged
for
smoking
if
they
swore
they
received
eighty
lashes
for
every
expletive
and
after
eighty
lashes
it
was
a
common
thing
to
die
before
long
flogging
grew
to
be
so
everyday
an
incident
that
the
young
men
made
a
game
of
it
as
a
test
of
their
endurance
of
pain
with
this
spartan
ferocity
there
was
mingled
the
glamour
and
the
mystery
of
the
east
the
mahdi
himself
his
four
khalifas
and
the
principal
emirs
masters
of
sudden
riches
surrounded
themselves
with
slaves
and
women
with
trains
of
horses
and
asses
with
body
guards
and
glittering
arms
there
were
rumours
of
debaucheries
in
high
places
of
the
mahdi
forgetful
of
his
own
ordinances
revelling
in
the
recesses
of
his
harem
and
quaffing
date
syrup
mixed
with
ginger
out
of
the
silver
cups
looted
from
the
church
of
the
christians
but
that
imposing
figure
had
only
to
show
itself
for
the
tongue
of
scandal
to
be
stilled
the
tall
majestic
man
with
the
dark
face
and
black
beard
and
great
eyes
who
could
doubt
that
he
was
the
embodiment
of
a
superhuman
power
fascination
dwelt
in
every
movement
every
glance
the
eyes
painted
with
antimony
flashed
extraordinary
fires
the
exquisite
smile
revealed
beneath
the
vigorous
lips
white
upper
teeth
with
a
space
between
them
the
certain
sign
of
fortune
his
turban
was
folded
with
faultless
art
his
jibbeh
speckless
was
perfumed
with
musk
and
attar
of
roses
he
was
at
once
all
courtesy
and
all
command
thousands
followed
him
thousands
prostrated
themselves
before
him
thousands
when
he
lifted
up
his
voice
in
solemn
worship
knew
that
the
heavens
were
opened
and
that
they
had
come
near
to
god
then
all
at
once
the
onbeia
the
trumpet
would
give
out
its
enormous
sound
the
nahas
the
brazen
wardrums
would
summon
with
their
weird
rolling
the
whole
host
to
arms
the
green
flag
and
the
red
flag
and
the
black
flag
would
rise
over
the
multitude
the
great
army
would
move
forward
coloured
glistening
dark
violent
proud
beautiful
the
drunkenness
the
madness
of
religion
would
blaze
on
every
face
and
the
mahdi
immovable
on
his
charger
would
let
the
scene
grow
under
his
eyes
in
silence
el
obeid
fell
in
january
meanwhile
events
of
the
deepest
importance
had
occurred
in
egypt
the
rise
of
arabi
had
synchronised
with
that
of
the
mahdi
both
movements
were
nationalist
both
were
directed
against
alien
rulers
who
had
shown
themselves
unfit
to
rule
while
the
sudanese
were
shaking
off
the
yoke
of
egypt
the
egyptians
themselves
grew
impatient
of
their
own
masters
the
turkish
and
circassian
pashas
who
filled
with
their
incompetence
all
the
high
offices
of
state
the
army
led
by
ahmed
arabi
a
colonel
of
fellah
origin
mutinied
the
khedive
gave
way
and
it
seemed
as
if
a
new
order
were
about
to
be
established
a
new
order
was
indeed
upon
the
point
of
appearing
but
it
was
of
a
kind
undreamt
of
in
arabi
philosophy
at
the
critical
moment
the
english
government
intervened
an
english
fleet
bombarded
alexandria
an
english
army
landed
under
lord
wolseley
and
defeated
arabi
and
his
supporters
at
the
rule
of
the
pashas
was
nominally
restored
but
henceforth
in
effect
the
english
were
masters
of
egypt
nevertheless
the
english
themselves
were
slow
to
recognise
this
fact
their
government
had
intervened
unwillingly
the
occupation
of
the
country
was
a
merely
temporary
measure
their
army
was
to
be
withdrawn
as
soon
as
a
tolerable
administration
had
been
set
up
but
a
tolerable
administration
presided
over
by
the
pashas
seemed
long
in
coming
and
the
english
army
remained
in
the
meantime
the
mahdi
had
entered
el
obeid
and
his
dominion
was
rapidly
spreading
over
the
greater
part
of
the
sudan
then
a
terrible
catastrophe
took
place
the
pashas
happy
once
more
in
cairo
pulling
the
old
strings
and
growing
fat
over
the
old
decided
to
give
the
world
an
unmistakable
proof
of
their
renewed
vigour
they
would
tolerate
the
insurrection
in
the
sudan
no
longer
they
would
destroy
the
mahdi
reduce
his
followers
to
submission
and
their
own
beneficent
rule
over
the
whole
country
to
this
end
they
collected
together
an
army
of
men
and
placed
it
under
the
command
of
colonel
hicks
a
retired
english
officer
he
was
ordered
to
advance
and
suppress
the
rebellion
in
these
proceedings
the
english
government
refused
to
take
any
part
unable
or
unwilling
to
realise
that
so
long
as
there
was
an
english
army
in
egypt
they
could
not
avoid
the
responsibilities
of
supreme
power
they
declared
that
the
domestic
policy
of
the
egyptian
administration
was
no
concern
of
theirs
it
was
a
fatal
error
an
error
which
they
themselves
before
many
weeks
were
over
were
to
be
forced
by
the
hard
logic
of
events
to
admit
the
pashas
left
to
their
own
devices
mismanaged
the
hicks
expedition
to
their
hearts
content
the
miserable
troops
swept
together
from
the
relics
of
arabi
disbanded
army
were
dispatched
to
khartoum
in
chains
after
a
month
drilling
they
were
pronounced
to
be
fit
to
attack
the
fanatics
of
the
sudan
colonel
hicks
was
a
brave
man
urged
on
by
the
authorities
in
cairo
he
shut
his
eyes
to
the
danger
ahead
of
him
and
marched
out
from
khartoum
in
the
direction
of
el
obeid
at
the
beginning
of
september
abandoning
his
communications
he
was
soon
deep
in
the
desolate
wastes
of
kordofan
as
he
advanced
his
difficulties
increased
the
guides
were
treacherous
the
troops
grew
exhausted
the
supply
of
water
gave
out
he
pressed
on
and
at
last
on
november
not
far
from
el
obeid
the
harassed
fainting
almost
desperate
army
plunged
into
a
vast
forest
of
gumtrees
and
mimosa
scrub
there
was
a
sudden
appalling
yell
the
mahdi
with
of
his
finest
men
sprang
from
their
ambush
the
egyptians
were
surrounded
and
immediately
overpowered
it
was
not
a
defeat
but
an
annihilation
hicks
and
his
european
staff
were
slaughtered
the
whole
army
was
slaughtered
wounded
wretches
crept
away
into
the
forest
the
consequences
of
this
event
were
felt
in
every
part
of
the
sudan
to
the
westward
in
darfur
the
governor
slatin
pasha
after
a
prolonged
and
valiant
resistance
was
forced
to
surrender
and
the
whole
province
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
rebels
southwards
in
the
lupton
bey
was
shut
up
in
a
remote
stronghold
while
the
country
was
overrun
the
mahdi
triumphs
were
beginning
to
penetrate
even
into
the
tropical
regions
of
equatoria
the
tribes
were
rising
and
emir
pasha
was
preparing
to
retreat
towards
the
great
lakes
on
the
east
osman
digna
pushed
the
insurrection
right
up
to
the
shores
of
the
red
sea
and
laid
siege
to
suakin
before
the
year
was
over
with
the
exception
of
a
few
isolated
and
surrounded
garrisons
the
mahdi
was
absolute
lord
of
a
territory
equal
to
the
combined
area
of
spain
france
and
germany
and
his
victorious
armies
were
rapidly
closing
round
khartoum
when
the
news
of
the
hicks
disaster
reached
cairo
the
pashas
calmly
announced
that
they
would
collect
another
army
of
men
and
again
attack
the
mahdi
but
the
english
government
understood
at
last
the
gravity
of
the
case
they
saw
that
a
crisis
was
upon
them
and
that
they
could
no
longer
escape
the
implications
of
their
position
in
egypt
what
were
they
to
do
were
they
to
allow
the
egyptians
to
become
more
and
more
deeply
involved
in
a
ruinous
perhaps
ultimately
a
fatal
war
with
the
mahdi
and
if
not
what
steps
were
they
to
take
a
small
minority
of
the
party
then
in
power
in
england
the
liberal
party
were
anxious
to
withdraw
from
egypt
altogether
and
at
once
on
the
other
hand
another
and
a
more
influential
minority
with
representatives
in
the
cabinet
were
in
favour
of
a
more
active
intervention
in
egyptian
affairs
of
the
deliberate
use
of
the
power
of
england
to
give
to
egypt
internal
stability
and
external
security
they
were
ready
if
necessary
to
take
the
field
against
the
mahdi
with
english
troops
but
the
great
bulk
of
the
party
and
the
cabinet
with
gladstone
at
their
head
preferred
a
middle
course
realising
the
impracticality
of
an
immediate
withdrawal
they
were
nevertheless
determined
to
remain
in
egypt
not
a
moment
longer
than
was
necessary
and
in
the
meantime
to
interfere
as
little
as
possible
in
egyptian
affairs
from
a
campaign
in
the
sudan
conducted
by
an
english
army
they
were
altogether
averse
if
therefore
the
english
army
was
not
to
be
used
and
the
egyptian
army
was
not
fit
to
be
used
against
the
mahdi
it
followed
that
any
attempt
to
reconquer
the
sudan
must
be
abandoned
the
remaining
egyptian
troops
must
be
withdrawn
and
in
future
military
operations
must
be
limited
to
those
of
a
strictly
defensive
kind
such
was
the
decision
of
the
english
government
their
determination
was
strengthened
by
two
considerations
in
the
first
place
they
saw
that
the
mahdi
rebellion
was
largely
a
nationalist
movement
directed
against
an
alien
power
and
in
the
second
place
the
policy
of
withdrawal
from
the
sudan
was
the
policy
of
their
own
representative
in
egypt
sir
evelyn
baring
who
had
lately
been
appointed
at
cairo
there
was
only
one
serious
obstacle
in
the
way
the
attitude
of
the
pashas
at
the
head
of
the
egyptian
government
the
infatuated
old
men
were
convinced
that
they
would
have
better
luck
next
time
that
another
army
and
another
hicks
would
certainly
destroy
the
mahdi
and
that
even
if
the
mahdi
were
again
victorious
yet
another
army
and
yet
another
hicks
would
no
doubt
be
forthcoming
and
that
they
would
do
the
trick
or
failing
that
but
they
refused
to
consider
eventualities
any
further
in
the
face
of
such
opposition
the
english
government
unwilling
as
they
were
to
interfere
saw
that
there
was
no
choice
open
to
them
but
to
exercise
pressure
they
therefore
instructed
sir
evelyn
baring
in
the
event
of
the
egyptian
government
refusing
to
withdraw
from
the
sudan
to
insist
upon
the
khedive
appointing
other
ministers
who
would
be
willing
to
do
so
meanwhile
not
only
the
government
but
the
public
in
england
were
beginning
to
realise
the
alarming
nature
of
the
egyptian
situation
it
was
some
time
before
the
details
of
the
hicks
expedition
were
fully
known
but
when
they
were
and
when
the
appalling
character
of
the
disaster
was
understood
a
thrill
of
horror
ran
through
the
country
the
newspapers
became
full
of
articles
on
the
sudan
of
personal
descriptions
of
the
mahdi
of
agitated
letters
from
colonels
and
clergymen
demanding
vengeance
and
of
serious
discussions
of
future
policy
in
egypt
then
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
alarming
messages
began
to
arrive
from
khartoum
colonel
coetlogon
who
was
in
command
of
the
egyptian
troops
reported
a
menacing
concentration
of
the
enemy
day
by
day
hour
by
hour
affairs
grew
worse
the
egyptians
were
obviously
outnumbered
they
could
not
maintain
themselves
in
the
field
khartoum
was
in
danger
at
any
moment
its
investment
might
be
complete
and
with
khartoum
once
cut
off
from
communication
with
egypt
what
might
not
happen
colonel
coetlogon
began
to
calculate
how
long
the
city
would
hold
out
perhaps
it
could
not
resist
the
mahdi
for
a
month
perhaps
for
more
than
a
month
but
he
began
to
talk
of
the
necessity
of
a
speedy
retreat
it
was
clear
that
a
climax
was
approaching
and
that
measures
must
be
taken
to
forestall
it
at
once
accordingly
sir
evelyn
baring
on
receipt
of
final
orders
from
england
presented
an
ultimatum
to
the
egyptian
government
the
ministry
must
either
sanction
the
evacuation
of
the
sudan
or
it
must
resign
the
ministry
was
obstinate
and
on
january
it
resigned
to
be
replaced
by
a
more
pliable
body
of
pashas
on
the
same
day
general
gordon
arrived
at
southampton
he
was
over
fifty
and
he
was
still
by
the
world
measurements
an
unimportant
man
in
spite
of
his
achievements
in
spite
of
a
certain
celebrity
for
gordon
was
still
occasionally
spoken
of
he
was
unrecognised
and
almost
unemployed
he
had
spent
a
lifetime
in
the
dubious
services
of
foreign
governments
punctuated
by
futile
drudgeries
at
home
and
now
after
a
long
idleness
he
had
been
sent
for
to
do
what
to
look
after
the
congo
for
the
king
of
the
belgians
at
his
age
even
if
he
survived
the
work
and
the
climate
he
could
hardly
look
forward
to
any
subsequent
appointment
he
would
return
from
the
congo
old
and
worn
out
to
a
villa
and
extinction
such
were
general
gordon
prospects
on
january
by
january
his
name
was
on
every
tongue
he
was
the
favourite
of
the
nation
he
had
been
declared
to
be
the
one
living
man
capable
of
coping
with
the
perils
of
the
hour
he
had
been
chosen
with
unanimous
approval
to
perform
a
great
task
and
he
had
left
england
on
a
mission
which
was
to
bring
him
not
only
a
boundless
popularity
but
an
immortal
fame
the
circumstances
which
led
to
a
change
so
sudden
and
so
remarkable
are
less
easily
explained
than
might
have
been
wished
an
ambiguity
hangs
over
them
an
ambiguity
which
the
discretion
of
eminent
persons
has
certainly
not
diminished
but
some
of
the
facts
are
clear
enough
the
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
sudan
had
no
sooner
been
taken
than
it
had
become
evident
that
the
operation
would
be
a
difficult
and
hazardous
one
and
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
send
to
khartoum
an
emissary
armed
with
special
powers
and
possessed
of
special
ability
to
carry
it
out
towards
the
end
of
november
somebody
at
the
war
office
it
is
not
clear
who
had
suggested
that
this
emissary
should
be
general
gordon
lord
granville
the
foreign
secretary
had
thereupon
telegraphed
to
sir
evelyn
baring
asking
whether
in
his
opinion
the
presence
of
general
gordon
would
be
useful
in
egypt
sir
evelyn
baring
had
replied
that
the
egyptian
government
was
averse
to
this
proposal
and
the
matter
had
dropped
there
was
no
further
reference
to
gordon
in
the
official
dispatches
until
after
his
return
to
england
nor
before
that
date
was
any
allusion
made
to
him
as
a
possible
unraveller
of
the
sudan
difficulty
in
the
press
in
all
the
discussions
which
followed
the
news
of
the
hicks
disaster
his
name
is
only
to
be
found
in
occasional
and
incidental
references
to
his
work
in
the
sudan
the
pall
mall
gazette
which
more
than
any
other
newspaper
interested
itself
in
egyptian
affairs
alluded
to
gordon
once
or
twice
as
a
geographical
expert
but
in
an
enumeration
of
the
leading
authorities
on
the
sudan
left
him
out
of
account
altogether
yet
it
was
from
the
pall
mall
gazette
that
the
impulsion
which
projected
him
into
a
blaze
of
publicity
finally
came
stead
its
enterprising
editor
went
down
to
southampton
the
day
after
gordon
arrival
there
and
obtained
an
interview
now
when
he
was
in
the
mood
after
a
little
and
especially
no
one
was
more
capable
than
gordon
with
his
facile
speech
and
his
manners
of
furnishing
good
copy
for
a
journalist
and
stead
made
the
most
of
his
opportunity
the
interview
copious
and
pointed
was
published
next
day
in
the
most
prominent
part
of
the
paper
together
with
a
leading
article
demanding
that
the
general
should
be
immediately
dispatched
to
khartoum
with
the
widest
powers
the
rest
of
the
press
both
in
london
and
in
the
provinces
at
once
took
up
the
cry
general
gordon
was
a
capable
and
energetic
officer
he
was
a
noble
and
man
he
was
a
national
asset
he
was
a
statesman
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word
the
occasion
was
pressing
and
perilous
general
gordon
had
been
for
years
of
the
sudan
general
gordon
alone
had
the
knowledge
the
courage
the
virtue
which
would
save
the
situation
general
gordon
must
go
to
khartoum
so
for
a
week
the
papers
sang
in
chorus
but
already
those
in
high
places
had
taken
a
step
stead
interview
appeared
on
the
afternoon
of
january
and
on
the
morning
of
january
lord
granville
telegraphed
to
sir
evelyn
baring
proposing
for
a
second
time
that
gordon
services
should
be
utilised
in
egypt
but
sir
evelyn
baring
for
the
second
time
rejected
the
proposal
while
these
messages
were
flashing
to
and
fro
gordon
himself
was
paying
a
visit
to
the
rev
barnes
at
the
vicarage
of
heavitree
near
exeter
the
conversation
ran
chiefly
on
biblical
and
spiritual
matters
on
the
light
thrown
by
the
old
testament
upon
the
geography
of
palestine
and
on
the
relations
between
man
and
his
maker
but
there
were
moments
when
topics
of
a
more
worldly
interest
arose
it
happened
that
sir
samuel
baker
gordon
predecessor
in
equatoria
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
a
meeting
was
arranged
and
the
two
with
barnes
in
attendance
went
for
a
drive
together
in
the
carriage
sir
samuel
baker
taking
up
the
tale
of
the
pall
mall
gazette
dilated
upon
the
necessity
of
his
friend
returning
to
the
sudan
as
gordon
was
silent
but
barnes
noticed
that
his
blue
eyes
flashed
while
an
eager
expression
passed
over
his
face
late
that
night
after
the
vicar
had
retired
to
bed
he
was
surprised
by
the
door
suddenly
opening
and
by
the
appearance
of
his
guest
swiftly
tripping
into
the
room
saw
me
today
the
low
voice
abruptly
questioned
mean
in
the
carriage
replied
the
startled
barnes
came
the
reply
saw
me
that
was
myself
the
self
i
want
to
get
rid
of
there
was
a
sliding
movement
the
door
swung
to
and
the
vicar
found
himself
alone
again
it
was
clear
that
a
disturbing
influence
had
found
its
way
into
mind
his
thoughts
wandering
through
africa
flitted
to
the
sudan
they
did
not
linger
at
the
congo
during
the
same
visit
he
took
the
opportunity
of
calling
upon
temple
the
bishop
of
exeter
and
asking
him
merely
as
a
hypothetical
question
whether
in
his
opinion
sudanese
converts
to
christianity
might
be
permitted
to
keep
three
wives
his
lordship
answered
that
this
would
be
uncanonical
a
few
days
later
it
appeared
that
the
conversation
in
the
carriage
at
heavitree
had
borne
fruit
gordon
wrote
a
letter
to
sir
samuel
baker
further
elaborating
the
opinions
on
the
sudan
which
he
had
already
expressed
in
his
interview
with
stead
the
letter
was
clearly
intended
for
publication
and
published
it
was
in
the
times
of
january
on
the
same
day
gordon
name
began
once
more
to
buzz
along
the
wires
in
secret
questions
and
answers
to
and
from
the
highest
quarters
it
not
be
advisable
telegraphed
lord
granville
to
gladstone
to
put
a
little
pressure
on
baring
to
induce
him
to
accept
the
assistance
of
general
gordon
gladstone
replied
also
by
a
telegram
in
the
affirmative
and
on
the
lord
wolseley
telegraphed
to
gordon
begging
him
to
come
to
london
immediately
lord
wolseley
who
was
one
of
gordon
oldest
friends
was
at
that
time
of
the
forces
there
was
a
long
interview
and
though
the
details
of
the
conversation
have
never
transpired
it
is
known
that
in
the
course
of
it
lord
wolseley
asked
gordon
if
he
would
be
willing
to
go
to
the
sudan
to
which
gordon
replied
that
there
was
only
one
objection
his
prior
engagement
to
the
king
of
the
belgians
before
nightfall
lord
granville
by
private
telegram
had
a
little
pressure
on
baring
had
he
said
indirectly
that
gordon
was
ready
to
go
at
once
to
the
sudan
on
the
following
rather
vague
terms
his
mission
to
be
to
report
to
her
majesty
government
on
the
military
situation
and
to
return
without
any
further
engagement
he
would
be
under
you
for
instructions
and
will
send
letters
through
you
under
flying
seal
he
might
be
of
use
lord
granville
added
in
informing
you
and
us
of
the
situation
it
would
be
popular
at
home
but
there
may
be
countervailing
objections
tell
me
such
was
lord
granville
concluding
injunction
real
opinion
it
was
the
third
time
of
asking
and
sir
evelyn
baring
resisted
no
longer
he
telegraphed
on
the
be
the
best
man
if
he
will
pledge
himself
to
carry
out
the
policy
of
withdrawing
from
the
sudan
as
quickly
as
is
possible
consistently
with
saving
life
he
must
also
understand
that
he
must
take
his
instructions
from
the
british
representative
in
egypt
i
would
rather
have
him
than
anyone
else
provided
there
is
a
perfectly
clear
understanding
with
him
as
to
what
his
position
is
to
be
and
what
line
of
policy
he
is
to
carry
out
otherwise
not
whoever
goes
should
be
distinctly
warned
that
he
will
undertake
a
service
of
great
difficulty
and
danger
in
the
meantime
gordon
with
the
sudan
upon
his
lips
with
the
sudan
in
his
imagination
had
hurried
to
brussels
to
obtain
from
the
king
of
the
belgians
a
reluctant
consent
to
the
postponement
of
his
congo
mission
on
the
he
was
recalled
to
london
by
a
telegram
from
lord
wolseley
on
the
the
final
decision
was
made
noon
gordon
told
the
rev
barnes
wolseley
came
to
me
and
took
me
to
the
ministers
he
went
in
and
talked
to
the
ministers
and
came
back
and
said
her
government
wants
you
to
undertake
this
government
is
determined
to
evacuate
the
sudan
for
they
will
not
guarantee
future
government
will
you
go
and
do
it
i
said
yes
he
said
go
in
i
went
in
and
saw
them
they
said
did
wolseley
tell
you
your
orders
i
said
yes
i
said
you
will
not
guarantee
future
government
of
the
sudan
and
you
wish
me
to
go
up
and
evacuate
now
they
said
yes
and
it
was
over
such
was
the
sequence
of
events
which
ended
in
general
gordon
last
appointment
the
precise
motives
of
those
responsible
for
these
transactions
are
less
easy
to
discern
it
is
difficult
to
understand
what
the
reasons
could
have
been
which
induced
the
government
not
only
to
override
the
hesitations
of
sir
evelyn
baring
but
to
overlook
the
grave
and
obvious
dangers
involved
in
sending
such
a
man
as
gordon
to
the
sudan
the
whole
history
of
his
life
the
whole
bent
of
his
character
seemed
to
disqualify
him
for
the
task
for
which
he
had
been
chosen
he
was
before
all
things
a
fighter
an
enthusiast
a
bold
adventurer
and
he
was
now
to
be
entrusted
with
the
conduct
of
an
inglorious
retreat
he
was
alien
to
the
subtleties
of
civilised
statesmanship
he
was
unamenable
to
official
control
he
was
incapable
of
the
skilful
management
of
delicate
situations
and
he
was
now
to
be
placed
in
a
position
of
great
complexity
requiring
at
once
a
cool
judgment
a
clear
perception
of
fact
and
a
fixed
determination
to
carry
out
a
line
of
policy
laid
down
from
above
he
had
it
is
true
been
of
the
sudan
but
he
was
now
to
return
to
the
scene
of
his
greatness
as
the
emissary
of
a
defeated
and
humbled
power
he
was
to
be
a
fugitive
where
he
had
once
been
a
ruler
the
very
success
of
his
mission
was
to
consist
in
establishing
the
triumph
of
those
forces
which
he
had
spent
years
in
trampling
underfoot
all
this
should
have
been
clear
to
those
in
authority
after
a
very
little
reflection
it
was
clear
enough
to
sir
evelyn
baring
though
with
characteristic
reticence
he
had
abstained
from
giving
expression
to
his
thoughts
but
even
if
a
general
acquaintance
with
gordon
life
and
character
were
not
sufficient
to
lead
to
these
conclusions
he
himself
had
taken
care
to
put
their
validity
beyond
reasonable
doubt
both
in
his
interview
with
stead
and
in
his
letter
to
sir
samuel
baker
he
had
indicated
unmistakably
his
own
attitude
towards
the
sudan
situation
the
policy
which
he
advocated
the
state
of
feeling
in
which
he
showed
himself
to
be
was
diametrically
opposed
to
the
declared
intentions
of
the
government
he
was
by
no
means
in
favour
of
withdrawing
from
the
sudan
he
was
in
favour
as
might
have
been
supposed
of
vigorous
military
action
it
might
be
necessary
to
abandon
for
the
time
being
the
more
remote
garrisons
in
darfur
and
equatoria
but
khartoum
must
be
held
at
all
costs
to
allow
the
mahdi
to
enter
khartoum
would
not
merely
mean
the
return
of
the
whole
of
the
sudan
to
barbarism
it
would
be
a
menace
to
the
safety
of
egypt
herself
to
attempt
to
protect
egypt
against
the
mahdi
by
fortifying
her
southern
frontier
was
preposterous
might
as
well
fortify
against
a
fever
arabia
syria
the
whole
mohammedan
world
would
be
shaken
by
the
mahdi
advance
gordon
declared
to
stead
the
policy
of
evacuation
can
not
possibly
be
justified
the
true
policy
was
obvious
a
strong
man
sir
samuel
baker
perhaps
must
be
sent
to
khartoum
with
a
large
contingent
of
indian
and
turkish
troops
and
with
two
millions
of
money
he
would
very
soon
overpower
the
mahdi
whose
forces
would
to
pieces
of
themselves
for
in
gordon
opinion
it
was
entire
mistake
to
regard
the
mahdi
as
in
any
sense
a
religious
leader
he
would
collapse
as
soon
as
he
was
face
to
face
with
an
english
general
then
the
distant
regions
of
darfur
and
equatoria
could
once
more
be
occupied
their
original
sultans
could
be
reinstated
the
whole
country
would
be
placed
under
civilised
rule
and
the
would
be
finally
abolished
these
were
the
views
which
gordon
publicly
expressed
on
january
and
on
january
and
it
certainly
seems
strange
that
on
january
and
on
january
lord
granville
should
have
proposed
without
a
word
of
consultation
with
gordon
himself
to
send
him
on
a
mission
which
involved
not
the
reconquest
but
the
abandonment
of
the
sudan
gordon
indeed
when
he
was
actually
approached
by
lord
wolseley
had
apparently
agreed
to
become
the
agent
of
a
policy
which
was
exactly
the
reverse
of
his
own
no
doubt
too
it
is
possible
for
a
subordinate
to
suppress
his
private
convictions
and
to
carry
out
loyally
in
spite
of
them
the
orders
of
his
superiors
but
how
rare
are
the
qualities
of
and
wisdom
which
such
a
subordinate
must
possess
and
how
little
reason
there
was
to
think
that
general
gordon
possessed
them
in
fact
the
conduct
of
the
government
wears
so
singular
an
appearance
that
it
has
seemed
necessary
to
account
for
it
by
some
ulterior
explanation
it
has
often
been
asserted
that
the
true
cause
of
appointment
was
the
clamour
in
the
press
it
is
said
among
others
by
sir
evelyn
baring
himself
who
has
given
something
like
an
official
sanction
to
this
view
of
the
case
that
the
government
could
not
resist
the
pressure
of
the
newspapers
and
the
feeling
in
the
country
which
it
indicated
that
ministers
carried
off
their
feet
by
a
wave
of
cultus
were
obliged
to
give
way
to
the
inevitable
but
this
suggestion
is
hardly
supported
by
an
examination
of
the
facts
already
early
in
december
and
many
weeks
before
gordon
name
had
begun
to
figure
in
the
newspapers
lord
granville
had
made
his
first
effort
to
induce
sir
evelyn
baring
to
accept
gordon
services
the
first
newspaper
demand
for
a
gordon
mission
appeared
in
the
pall
mall
gazette
on
the
afternoon
of
january
and
the
very
next
morning
lord
granville
was
making
his
second
telegraphic
attack
upon
sir
evelyn
baring
the
feeling
in
the
press
did
not
become
general
until
the
and
on
the
lord
granville
in
his
telegram
to
gladstone
for
the
third
time
proposed
the
appointment
of
gordon
clearly
on
the
part
of
lord
granville
at
any
rate
there
was
no
extreme
desire
to
resist
the
wishes
of
the
press
nor
was
the
government
as
a
whole
by
any
means
incapable
of
ignoring
public
opinion
a
few
months
were
to
show
that
plainly
enough
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
the
conclusion
that
if
ministers
had
been
opposed
to
the
appointment
of
gordon
he
would
never
have
been
appointed
as
it
was
the
newspapers
were
in
fact
forestalled
rather
than
followed
by
the
government
how
then
are
we
to
explain
the
government
action
are
we
to
suppose
that
its
members
like
the
members
of
the
public
at
large
were
themselves
carried
away
by
a
sudden
enthusiasm
a
sudden
conviction
that
they
had
found
their
saviour
that
general
gordon
was
the
man
they
did
not
quite
know
why
but
that
was
of
no
consequence
the
one
man
to
get
them
out
of
the
whole
sudan
difficulty
they
did
not
quite
know
how
but
that
was
of
no
consequence
either
if
only
he
were
sent
to
khartoum
doubtless
even
cabinet
ministers
are
liable
to
such
impulses
doubtless
it
is
possible
that
the
cabinet
of
that
day
allowed
itself
to
drift
out
of
mere
lack
of
consideration
and
judgment
and
foresight
along
the
rapid
stream
of
popular
feeling
towards
the
inevitable
cataract
that
may
be
so
yet
there
are
indications
that
a
more
definite
influence
was
at
work
there
was
a
section
of
the
government
which
had
never
become
quite
reconciled
to
the
policy
of
withdrawing
from
the
sudan
to
this
section
we
may
call
it
the
imperialist
section
which
was
led
inside
the
cabinet
by
lord
hartington
and
outside
by
lord
wolseley
the
policy
which
really
commended
itself
was
the
very
policy
which
had
been
outlined
by
general
gordon
in
his
interview
with
stead
and
his
letter
to
sir
samuel
baker
they
saw
that
it
might
be
necessary
to
abandon
some
of
the
outlying
parts
of
the
sudan
to
the
mahdi
but
the
prospect
of
leaving
the
whole
province
in
his
hands
was
highly
distasteful
to
them
above
all
they
dreaded
the
loss
of
khartoum
now
supposing
that
general
gordon
in
response
to
a
popular
agitation
in
the
press
were
sent
to
khartoum
what
would
follow
was
it
not
at
least
possible
that
once
there
with
his
views
and
his
character
he
would
for
some
reason
or
other
refrain
from
carrying
out
a
policy
of
pacific
retreat
was
it
not
possible
that
in
that
case
he
might
so
involve
the
english
government
that
it
would
find
itself
obliged
almost
imperceptibly
perhaps
to
substitute
for
its
policy
of
withdrawal
a
policy
of
advance
was
it
not
possible
that
general
gordon
might
get
into
difficulties
that
he
might
be
surrounded
and
cut
off
from
egypt
if
that
were
to
happen
how
could
the
english
government
avoid
the
necessity
of
sending
an
expedition
to
rescue
him
and
if
an
english
expedition
went
to
the
sudan
was
it
conceivable
that
it
would
leave
the
mahdi
as
it
found
him
in
short
would
not
the
dispatch
of
general
gordon
to
khartoum
involve
almost
inevitably
the
conquest
of
the
sudan
by
british
troops
followed
by
a
british
occupation
and
behind
all
these
questions
a
still
larger
question
loomed
the
position
of
the
english
in
egypt
itself
was
still
ambiguous
the
future
was
obscure
how
long
in
reality
would
an
english
army
remain
in
egypt
was
not
one
thing
at
least
obvious
that
if
the
english
were
to
conquer
and
occupy
the
sudan
their
evacuation
of
egypt
would
become
impossible
with
our
present
information
it
would
be
rash
to
affirm
that
all
or
any
of
these
considerations
were
present
to
the
minds
of
the
imperialist
section
of
the
government
yet
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
a
man
such
as
lord
wolseley
for
instance
with
his
knowledge
of
affairs
and
his
knowledge
of
gordon
could
have
altogether
overlooked
them
lord
hartington
indeed
may
well
have
failed
to
realise
at
once
the
implications
of
general
gordon
appointment
for
it
took
lord
hartington
some
time
to
realise
the
implications
of
anything
but
lord
hartington
was
very
far
from
being
a
fool
and
we
may
well
suppose
that
he
instinctively
perhaps
subconsciously
apprehended
the
elements
of
a
situation
which
he
never
formulated
to
himself
however
that
may
be
certain
circumstances
are
significant
it
is
significant
that
the
who
acted
as
the
government
agent
in
its
negotiations
with
gordon
was
an
imperialist
lord
wolseley
it
is
significant
that
the
whom
gordon
finally
interviewed
and
who
actually
determined
his
appointment
were
by
no
means
the
whole
of
the
cabinet
but
a
small
section
of
it
presided
over
by
lord
hartington
it
is
significant
too
that
gordon
mission
was
represented
both
to
sir
evelyn
baring
who
was
opposed
to
his
appointment
and
to
gladstone
who
was
opposed
to
an
active
policy
in
the
sudan
as
a
mission
merely
report
while
no
sooner
was
the
mission
actually
decided
upon
than
it
began
to
assume
a
very
different
complexion
in
his
final
interview
with
the
gordon
we
know
though
he
said
nothing
about
it
to
the
rev
mr
barnes
threw
out
the
suggestion
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
make
him
the
of
the
sudan
the
suggestion
for
the
moment
was
not
taken
up
but
it
is
obvious
that
a
man
does
not
propose
to
become
a
in
order
to
make
a
report
we
are
in
the
region
of
speculations
one
other
presents
itself
was
the
movement
in
the
press
during
that
second
week
of
january
a
genuine
movement
expressing
a
spontaneous
wave
of
popular
feeling
or
was
it
a
cause
of
that
feeling
rather
than
an
effect
the
engineering
of
a
newspaper
agitation
may
not
have
been
an
impossibility
even
so
long
ago
as
one
would
like
to
know
more
than
one
is
ever
likely
to
know
of
the
relations
of
the
imperialist
section
of
the
government
with
stead
but
it
is
time
to
return
to
the
solidity
of
fact
within
a
few
hours
of
his
interview
with
the
ministers
gordon
had
left
england
forever
at
eight
in
the
evening
there
was
a
little
gathering
of
elderly
gentlemen
at
victoria
station
gordon
accompanied
by
colonel
stewart
who
was
to
act
as
his
tripped
on
to
the
platform
lord
granville
bought
the
necessary
tickets
the
duke
of
cambridge
opened
the
door
the
general
jumped
into
the
train
and
then
lord
wolseley
appeared
carrying
a
leather
bag
in
which
was
in
gold
collected
from
friends
at
the
last
moment
for
the
contingencies
of
the
journey
the
bag
was
handed
through
the
window
the
train
started
as
it
did
so
gordon
leaned
out
and
addressed
a
last
whispered
question
to
lord
wolseley
yes
it
had
been
done
lord
wolseley
had
seen
to
it
himself
next
morning
every
member
of
the
cabinet
would
receive
a
copy
of
samuel
clarke
scripture
promises
that
was
all
the
train
rolled
out
of
the
station
before
the
travellers
reached
cairo
steps
had
been
taken
which
finally
put
an
end
to
the
theory
if
it
had
ever
been
seriously
held
that
the
purpose
of
the
mission
was
simply
the
making
of
a
report
on
the
very
day
of
gordon
departure
lord
granville
telegraphed
to
sir
evelyn
baring
as
follows
suggests
that
it
may
be
announced
in
egypt
that
he
is
on
his
way
to
khartoum
to
arrange
for
the
future
settlement
of
the
sudan
for
the
best
advantage
of
the
people
nothing
was
said
of
reporting
a
few
days
later
gordon
himself
telegraphed
to
lord
granville
suggesting
that
he
should
be
made
of
the
sudan
in
order
to
the
evacuation
and
to
to
the
various
sultans
of
the
sudan
their
independence
lord
granville
at
once
authorised
sir
evelyn
baring
to
issue
if
he
thought
fit
a
proclamation
to
this
effect
in
the
name
of
the
khedive
thus
the
mission
had
already
swollen
into
a
with
the
object
not
merely
of
effecting
the
evacuation
of
the
sudan
but
also
of
setting
up
sultans
to
take
the
place
of
the
egyptian
government
in
cairo
in
spite
of
the
hostilities
of
the
past
gordon
was
received
with
every
politeness
he
was
at
once
proclaimed
of
the
sudan
with
the
widest
powers
he
was
on
the
point
of
starting
off
again
on
his
journey
southwards
when
a
singular
and
important
incident
occurred
zobeir
the
rebel
chieftain
of
darfur
against
whose
forces
gordon
had
struggled
for
years
and
whose
son
suleiman
had
been
captured
and
executed
by
gessi
gordon
lieutenant
was
still
detained
at
cairo
it
so
fell
out
that
he
went
to
pay
a
visit
to
one
of
the
ministers
at
the
same
time
as
the
new
the
two
men
met
face
to
face
and
as
he
looked
into
the
savage
countenance
of
his
old
enemy
an
extraordinary
shock
of
inspiration
ran
through
gordon
brain
he
was
seized
as
he
explained
in
a
state
paper
which
he
drew
up
immediately
after
the
meeting
with
a
feeling
that
he
could
trust
zobeir
it
was
true
that
zobeir
was
greatest
who
ever
existed
it
was
true
that
he
had
a
personal
hatred
of
gordon
owing
to
the
execution
of
suleiman
one
can
not
wonder
at
it
if
one
is
a
father
it
was
true
that
only
a
few
days
previously
on
his
way
to
egypt
gordon
himself
had
been
so
convinced
of
the
dangerous
character
of
zobeir
that
he
had
recommended
by
telegram
his
removal
to
cyprus
but
such
considerations
were
utterly
obliterated
by
that
one
moment
of
electric
impact
of
personal
vision
henceforward
there
was
a
rooted
conviction
in
gordon
mind
that
zobeir
was
to
be
trusted
that
zobeir
must
join
him
at
khartoum
that
zobeir
presence
would
paralyse
the
mahdi
that
zobeir
must
succeed
him
in
the
government
of
the
country
after
the
evacuation
did
not
sir
evelyn
baring
too
have
the
mystic
feeling
sir
evelyn
baring
confessed
that
he
had
not
he
distrusted
mystic
feelings
zobeir
no
doubt
might
possibly
be
useful
but
before
deciding
upon
so
important
a
matter
it
was
necessary
to
reflect
and
to
consult
in
the
meantime
failing
zobeir
something
might
perhaps
be
done
with
the
emir
abdul
shakur
the
heir
of
the
darfur
sultans
the
emir
who
had
been
living
in
domestic
retirement
in
cairo
was
with
some
difficulty
discovered
given
an
embroidered
uniform
together
with
the
largest
decoration
that
could
be
found
and
informed
that
he
was
to
start
at
once
with
general
gordon
for
the
sudan
where
it
would
be
his
duty
to
occupy
the
province
of
darfur
after
driving
out
the
forces
of
the
mahdi
the
poor
man
begged
for
a
little
delay
but
no
delay
could
be
granted
he
hurried
to
the
railway
station
in
his
frockcoat
and
fez
and
rather
the
worse
for
liquor
several
extra
carriages
for
his
wives
and
a
large
quantity
of
luggage
had
then
to
be
hitched
on
to
the
train
and
at
the
last
moment
some
commotion
was
caused
by
the
unaccountable
disappearance
of
his
embroidered
uniform
it
was
found
but
his
troubles
were
not
over
on
the
steamer
general
gordon
was
very
rude
to
him
and
he
drowned
his
chagrin
in
hot
rum
and
water
at
assuan
he
disembarked
declaring
that
he
would
go
no
farther
eventually
however
he
got
as
far
as
dongola
whence
after
a
stay
of
a
few
months
he
returned
with
his
family
to
cairo
in
spite
of
this
little
contretemps
gordon
was
in
the
highest
spirits
at
last
his
capacities
had
been
recognised
by
his
countrymen
at
last
he
had
been
entrusted
with
a
task
great
enough
to
satisfy
even
his
desires
he
was
already
famous
he
would
soon
be
glorious
looking
out
once
more
over
the
familiar
desert
he
felt
the
searchings
of
his
conscience
stilled
by
the
manifest
certainty
that
it
was
for
this
that
providence
had
been
reserving
him
through
all
these
years
of
labour
and
of
sorrow
for
this
what
was
the
mahdi
to
stand
up
against
him
a
thousand
schemes
a
thousand
possibilities
sprang
to
life
in
his
pullulating
brain
a
new
intoxication
carried
him
away
faut
etre
toujours
ivre
tout
est
la
question
little
though
he
knew
it
gordon
was
a
disciple
of
baudelaire
ne
pas
sentir
fardeau
du
temps
qui
brise
vos
epaules
et
vous
penche
vers
la
terre
il
faut
vous
enivrer
sans
treve
yes
but
how
feeble
were
those
gross
resources
of
the
miserable
rum
brandy
oh
he
knew
all
about
them
they
were
nothing
he
tossed
off
a
glass
they
were
nothing
at
all
the
true
drunkenness
lay
elsewhere
he
seized
a
paper
and
pencil
and
dashed
down
a
telegram
to
sir
evelyn
baring
another
thought
struck
him
and
another
telegram
followed
and
another
and
yet
another
he
had
made
up
his
mind
he
would
visit
the
mahdi
in
person
and
alone
he
might
do
that
or
he
might
retire
to
the
equator
he
would
decidedly
retire
to
the
equator
and
hand
over
the
province
to
the
king
of
the
belgians
a
whole
flock
of
telegrams
flew
to
cairo
from
every
sir
evelyn
baring
was
patient
and
discrete
he
could
be
trusted
with
such
confidences
but
unfortunately
gordon
strange
exhilaration
found
other
outlets
at
berber
in
the
course
of
a
speech
to
the
assembled
chiefs
he
revealed
the
intention
of
the
egyptian
government
to
withdraw
from
the
sudan
the
news
was
everywhere
in
a
moment
and
the
results
were
disastrous
the
tribesmen
whom
fear
and
interest
had
still
kept
loyal
perceived
that
they
need
look
no
more
for
help
or
punishment
from
egypt
and
began
to
turn
their
eyes
towards
the
rising
sun
nevertheless
for
the
moment
the
prospect
wore
a
favourable
appearance
the
was
welcomed
at
every
stage
of
his
journey
and
on
february
he
made
a
triumphal
entry
into
khartoum
the
feeble
garrison
the
inhabitants
hailed
him
as
a
deliverer
surely
they
need
fear
no
more
now
that
the
great
english
pasha
had
come
among
them
his
first
acts
seemed
to
show
that
a
new
and
happy
era
had
begun
taxes
were
remitted
the
bonds
of
the
usurers
were
destroyed
the
victims
of
egyptian
injustice
were
set
free
from
the
prisons
the
immemorial
instruments
of
torture
the
stocks
and
the
whips
and
the
were
broken
to
pieces
in
the
public
square
a
bolder
measure
had
been
already
taken
a
proclamation
had
been
issued
sanctioning
slavery
in
the
sudan
gordon
arguing
that
he
was
powerless
to
do
away
with
the
odious
institution
which
as
soon
as
the
withdrawal
was
carried
out
would
inevitably
become
universal
had
decided
to
reap
what
benefit
he
could
from
the
public
abandonment
of
an
unpopular
policy
at
khartoum
the
announcement
was
received
with
enthusiasm
but
it
caused
considerable
perturbation
in
england
the
christian
hero
who
had
spent
so
many
years
of
his
life
in
suppressing
slavery
was
now
suddenly
found
to
be
using
his
high
powers
to
set
it
up
again
the
society
made
a
menacing
movement
but
the
government
showed
a
bold
front
and
the
popular
belief
in
gordon
infallibility
carried
the
day
he
himself
was
still
radiant
nor
amid
the
jubilation
and
the
devotion
which
surrounded
him
did
he
forget
higher
things
in
all
this
turmoil
he
told
his
sister
he
was
he
gave
injunctions
that
his
egyptian
troops
should
have
regular
morning
and
evening
prayers
worship
one
god
he
said
and
he
ordered
an
arabic
text
rules
the
hearts
of
all
men
to
be
put
up
over
the
chair
of
state
in
his
audience
chamber
as
the
days
went
by
he
began
to
feel
at
home
again
in
the
huge
palace
which
he
knew
so
well
the
glare
and
the
heat
of
that
southern
atmosphere
the
movement
of
the
crowded
city
the
populace
the
soldiers
and
the
suppliants
the
reawakened
consciousness
of
power
the
glamour
and
the
mystery
of
the
whole
strange
scene
these
things
seized
upon
him
engulfed
him
and
worked
a
new
transformation
on
his
intoxicated
heart
england
with
its
complications
and
its
policies
became
an
empty
vision
to
him
sir
evelyn
baring
with
his
cautions
and
sagacities
hardly
more
than
a
tiresome
name
he
was
gordon
pasha
he
was
the
he
was
the
ruler
of
the
sudan
he
was
among
his
people
his
own
people
and
it
was
to
them
only
that
he
was
responsible
to
them
and
to
god
was
he
to
let
them
fall
without
a
blow
into
the
clutches
of
a
sanguinary
impostor
never
he
was
there
to
prevent
that
the
distant
governments
might
mutter
something
about
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
he
poured
them
into
his
telegrams
and
sir
evelyn
baring
sat
aghast
the
man
who
had
left
london
a
month
before
with
instructions
to
upon
the
best
means
of
effecting
the
evacuation
of
the
sudan
was
now
openly
talking
of
up
the
mahdi
with
the
aid
of
british
and
indian
troops
sir
evelyn
baring
counted
upon
his
fingers
the
various
stages
of
this
extraordinary
development
in
general
gordon
opinions
but
he
might
have
saved
himself
the
trouble
for
in
fact
it
was
less
a
development
than
a
reversion
under
the
stress
of
the
excitements
and
the
realities
of
his
situation
at
khartoum
the
policy
which
gordon
was
now
proposing
to
carry
out
had
come
to
tally
in
every
particular
with
the
policy
which
he
had
originally
advocated
with
such
vigorous
conviction
in
the
pages
of
the
pall
mall
gazette
nor
was
the
adoption
of
that
policy
by
the
english
government
by
any
means
out
of
the
question
for
in
the
meantime
events
had
been
taking
place
in
the
eastern
sudan
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
red
sea
port
of
suakin
which
were
to
have
a
decisive
effect
upon
the
prospects
of
khartoum
general
baker
the
brother
of
sir
samuel
baker
attempting
to
relieve
the
beleaguered
garrisons
of
sinkat
and
tokar
had
rashly
attacked
the
forces
of
osman
digna
had
been
defeated
and
obliged
to
retire
sinkat
and
tokar
had
then
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
general
there
was
a
great
outcry
in
england
and
a
wave
of
warlike
feeling
passed
over
the
country
lord
wolseley
at
once
drew
up
a
memorandum
advocating
the
annexation
of
the
sudan
in
the
house
of
commons
even
liberals
began
to
demand
vengeance
and
military
action
whereupon
the
government
dispatched
sir
gerald
graham
with
a
considerable
british
force
to
suakin
sir
gerald
graham
advanced
and
in
the
battles
of
el
teb
and
tamai
inflicted
two
bloody
defeats
upon
the
mahdi
forces
it
almost
seemed
as
if
the
government
was
now
committed
to
a
policy
of
interference
and
conquest
as
if
the
imperialist
section
of
the
cabinet
were
at
last
to
have
their
way
the
dispatch
of
sir
gerald
graham
coincided
with
gordon
sudden
demand
for
british
and
indian
troops
with
which
to
up
the
mahdi
the
business
he
assured
sir
evelyn
baring
in
a
stream
of
telegrams
could
very
easily
be
done
it
made
him
sick
he
said
to
see
himself
held
in
check
and
the
people
of
the
sudan
tyrannised
over
by
feeble
lot
of
stinking
dervishes
let
zobeir
at
once
be
sent
down
to
him
and
all
would
be
well
the
original
sultans
of
the
country
had
unfortunately
proved
disappointing
their
place
should
be
taken
by
zobeir
after
the
mahdi
had
been
smashed
up
zobeir
should
rule
the
sudan
as
a
subsidised
vassal
of
england
on
a
similar
footing
to
that
of
the
amir
of
afghanistan
the
plan
was
perhaps
feasible
but
it
was
clearly
incompatible
with
the
policy
of
evacuation
as
it
had
been
hitherto
laid
down
by
the
english
government
should
they
reverse
that
policy
should
they
appoint
zobeir
reinforce
sir
gerald
graham
and
smash
up
the
mahdi
they
could
not
make
up
their
minds
so
far
as
zobeir
was
concerned
there
were
two
counterbalancing
considerations
on
the
one
hand
evelyn
baring
now
declared
that
he
was
in
favour
of
the
appointment
but
on
the
other
hand
would
english
public
opinion
consent
to
a
man
described
by
gordon
himself
as
greatest
who
ever
existed
being
given
an
english
subsidy
and
the
control
of
the
sudan
while
the
cabinet
was
wavering
gordon
took
a
fatal
step
the
delay
was
intolerable
and
one
evening
in
a
rage
he
revealed
his
desire
for
zobeir
which
had
hitherto
been
kept
a
profound
official
secret
to
mr
power
the
english
consul
at
khartoum
and
the
special
correspondent
of
the
times
perhaps
he
calculated
that
the
public
announcement
of
his
wishes
would
oblige
the
government
to
yield
to
them
if
so
he
was
completely
mistaken
for
the
result
was
the
very
reverse
the
country
already
startled
by
the
proclamation
in
favour
of
slavery
could
not
swallow
zobeir
the
society
set
on
foot
a
violent
agitation
opinion
in
the
house
of
commons
suddenly
stiffened
and
the
cabinet
by
a
substantial
majority
decided
that
zobeir
should
remain
in
cairo
the
imperialist
wave
had
risen
high
but
it
had
not
risen
high
enough
and
now
it
was
rapidly
subsiding
the
government
next
action
was
decisive
sir
gerald
graham
and
his
british
army
were
withdrawn
from
the
sudan
the
critical
fortnight
during
which
these
events
took
place
was
the
first
fortnight
of
march
by
the
close
of
it
gordon
position
had
undergone
a
rapid
and
terrible
change
not
only
did
he
find
himself
deprived
by
the
decision
of
the
government
both
of
the
hope
of
zobeir
assistance
and
of
the
prospect
of
smashing
up
the
mahdi
with
the
aid
of
british
troops
the
military
movements
in
the
eastern
sudan
produced
at
the
very
same
moment
a
yet
more
fatal
consequence
the
adherents
of
the
mahdi
had
been
maddened
they
had
not
been
crushed
by
sir
gerald
graham
victories
when
immediately
afterwards
the
english
withdrew
to
suakin
from
which
they
never
again
emerged
the
inference
seemed
obvious
they
had
been
defeated
and
their
power
was
at
an
end
the
warlike
tribes
to
the
north
and
the
northeast
of
khartoum
had
long
been
wavering
they
now
hesitated
no
longer
and
joined
the
mahdi
from
that
moment
it
was
less
than
a
month
from
gordon
arrival
at
khartoum
the
situation
of
the
town
was
desperate
the
line
of
communications
was
cut
though
it
still
might
be
possible
for
occasional
native
messengers
or
for
a
few
individuals
on
an
armed
steamer
to
win
their
way
down
the
river
into
egypt
the
removal
of
a
large
number
of
persons
the
loyal
inhabitants
or
the
egyptian
garrison
was
henceforward
an
impossibility
the
whole
scheme
of
the
gordon
mission
had
irremediably
collapsed
worse
still
gordon
himself
so
far
from
having
effected
the
evacuation
of
the
sudan
was
surrounded
by
the
enemy
question
now
is
sir
evelyn
baring
told
lord
granville
on
march
to
get
general
gordon
and
colonel
stewart
away
from
khartoum
the
actual
condition
of
the
town
however
was
not
from
a
military
point
of
view
so
serious
as
colonel
coetlogon
in
the
first
moments
of
panic
after
the
hicks
disaster
had
supposed
gordon
was
of
opinion
that
it
was
capable
of
sustaining
a
siege
of
many
months
with
his
usual
vigour
he
had
already
begun
to
prepare
an
elaborate
system
of
earthworks
mines
and
wire
entanglements
there
was
a
five
or
six
months
supply
of
food
there
was
a
great
quantity
of
ammunition
the
garrison
numbered
about
men
there
were
besides
nine
small
steamers
hitherto
used
for
purposes
of
communication
along
the
nile
which
fitted
with
guns
and
protected
by
metal
plates
were
of
considerable
military
value
are
all
right
gordon
told
his
sister
on
march
shall
go
on
for
months
so
far
at
any
rate
there
was
no
cause
for
despair
but
the
effervescent
happiness
of
three
weeks
since
had
vanished
gloom
doubt
disillusionment
had
swooped
down
again
upon
their
victim
i
must
believe
he
does
all
things
in
mercy
and
love
or
else
i
disbelieve
his
existence
there
is
no
half
way
in
the
matter
what
holes
do
i
not
put
myself
into
and
for
what
so
mixed
are
my
ideas
i
believe
ambition
put
me
here
in
this
ruin
was
not
that
the
explanation
of
it
all
lord
promise
is
not
for
the
fulfilment
of
earthly
wishes
therefore
if
things
come
to
ruin
here
he
is
still
faithful
and
is
carrying
out
his
great
work
of
divine
wisdom
how
could
he
have
forgotten
that
but
he
would
not
transgress
again
owe
all
to
god
and
nothing
to
myself
for
humanly
speaking
i
have
done
very
foolish
things
however
if
i
am
humbled
the
better
for
me
news
of
the
changed
circumstances
at
khartoum
was
not
slow
in
reaching
england
and
a
feeling
of
anxiety
began
to
spread
among
the
first
to
realise
the
gravity
of
the
situation
was
queen
victoria
is
alarming
she
telegraphed
to
lord
hartington
on
march
gordon
is
in
danger
you
are
bound
to
try
to
save
him
you
have
incurred
a
fearful
responsibility
with
an
unerring
instinct
her
majesty
forestalled
and
expressed
the
popular
sentiment
during
april
when
it
had
become
clear
that
the
wire
between
khartoum
and
cairo
had
been
severed
when
as
time
passed
no
word
came
northward
save
vague
rumours
of
disaster
when
at
last
a
curtain
of
impenetrable
mystery
closed
over
khartoum
the
growing
uneasiness
manifested
itself
in
letters
to
the
newspapers
in
leading
articles
and
in
a
flood
of
subscriptions
towards
a
relief
fund
at
the
beginning
of
may
the
public
alarm
reached
a
climax
it
now
appeared
to
be
certain
not
only
that
general
gordon
was
in
imminent
danger
but
that
no
steps
had
yet
been
taken
by
the
government
to
save
him
on
the
there
was
a
meeting
of
protest
and
indignation
at
james
hall
on
the
there
was
a
mass
meeting
in
hyde
park
on
the
there
was
a
meeting
at
manchester
the
baroness
wrote
an
agitated
letter
to
the
times
begging
for
further
subscriptions
somebody
else
proposed
that
a
special
fund
should
be
started
with
which
bribe
the
tribes
to
secure
the
general
personal
safety
a
country
vicar
made
another
suggestion
why
should
not
public
prayers
be
offered
up
for
general
gordon
in
every
church
in
the
kingdom
he
himself
had
adopted
that
course
last
sunday
not
this
he
concluded
the
godly
man
the
true
hero
himself
would
wish
to
be
done
it
was
all
of
no
avail
general
gordon
remained
in
peril
the
government
remained
inactive
finally
a
vote
of
censure
was
moved
in
the
house
of
commons
but
that
too
proved
useless
it
was
strange
the
same
executive
which
two
months
before
had
trimmed
its
sails
so
eagerly
to
the
shifting
gusts
of
popular
opinion
now
in
spite
of
a
rising
hurricane
held
on
its
course
a
new
spirit
it
was
clear
a
determined
an
intractable
spirit
had
taken
control
of
the
sudan
situation
what
was
it
the
explanation
was
simple
and
it
was
ominous
gladstone
had
intervened
the
old
statesman
was
now
entering
upon
the
penultimate
period
of
his
enormous
career
he
who
had
once
been
the
rising
hope
of
the
stern
and
unbending
tories
had
at
length
emerged
after
a
lifetime
of
transmutations
as
the
champion
of
militant
democracy
he
was
at
the
apex
of
his
power
his
great
rival
was
dead
he
stood
in
the
eye
of
the
nation
he
enjoyed
the
applause
the
confidence
the
admiration
the
adoration
even
of
multitudes
yet
such
was
the
peculiar
character
of
the
man
and
such
was
the
intensity
of
the
feelings
which
he
called
forth
at
this
very
moment
at
the
height
of
his
popularity
he
was
distrusted
and
loathed
already
an
unparalleled
animosity
was
gathering
its
forces
against
him
for
indeed
there
was
something
in
his
nature
which
invited
which
demanded
the
clashing
reactions
of
passionate
extremes
it
was
easy
to
worship
gladstone
to
see
in
him
the
perfect
model
of
the
upright
man
the
man
of
virtue
and
of
religion
the
man
whose
whole
life
had
been
devoted
to
the
application
of
high
principles
to
affairs
of
state
the
man
too
whose
sense
of
right
and
justice
was
invigorated
and
ennobled
by
an
enthusiastic
heart
it
was
also
easy
to
detest
him
as
a
hypocrite
to
despise
him
as
a
demagogue
and
to
dread
him
as
a
crafty
manipulator
of
men
and
things
for
the
purposes
of
his
own
ambition
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
one
or
other
of
these
conflicting
judgments
must
have
been
palpably
absurd
that
nothing
short
of
gross
prejudice
or
wilful
blindness
on
one
side
or
the
other
could
reconcile
such
contradictory
conceptions
of
a
single
human
being
but
it
was
not
so
elements
were
mixed
in
gladstone
that
his
bitterest
enemies
and
his
enemies
were
never
mild
and
his
warmest
friends
and
his
friends
were
never
tepid
could
justify
with
equal
plausibility
their
denunciations
or
their
praises
what
then
was
the
truth
in
the
physical
universe
there
are
no
chimeras
but
man
is
more
various
than
nature
was
gladstone
perhaps
a
chimera
of
the
spirit
did
his
very
essence
lie
in
the
confusion
of
incompatibles
his
very
essence
it
eludes
the
hand
that
seems
to
grasp
it
one
is
baffled
as
his
political
opponents
were
baffled
fifty
years
ago
the
soft
serpent
coils
harden
into
quick
strength
that
has
vanished
leaving
only
emptiness
and
perplexity
behind
speech
was
the
fibre
of
his
being
and
when
he
spoke
the
ambiguity
of
ambiguity
was
revealed
the
long
winding
intricate
sentences
with
their
vast
burden
of
subtle
and
complicated
qualifications
befogged
the
mind
like
clouds
and
like
clouds
too
dropped
thunder
bolts
could
it
not
then
at
least
be
said
of
him
with
certainty
that
his
was
a
complex
character
but
here
also
there
was
a
contradiction
in
spite
of
the
involutions
of
his
intellect
and
the
contortions
of
his
spirit
it
is
impossible
not
to
perceive
a
strain
of
naivete
in
gladstone
he
adhered
to
some
of
his
principles
that
of
the
value
of
representative
institutions
for
instance
with
a
faith
which
was
singularly
literal
his
views
upon
religion
were
uncritical
to
crudeness
he
had
no
sense
of
humour
compared
with
disraeli
his
attitude
towards
life
strikes
one
as
that
of
an
ingenuous
child
his
very
egoism
was
through
all
the
labyrinth
of
his
passions
there
ran
a
single
thread
but
the
centre
of
the
labyrinth
ah
the
thread
might
lead
there
through
those
wandering
mazes
at
last
only
with
the
last
corner
turned
the
last
step
taken
the
explorer
might
find
that
he
was
looking
down
into
the
gulf
of
a
crater
the
flame
shot
out
on
every
side
scorching
and
brilliant
but
in
the
midst
there
was
a
darkness
that
gladstone
motives
and
ambitions
were
not
merely
those
of
a
hunter
after
popularity
was
never
shown
more
clearly
than
in
that
part
of
his
career
which
more
than
any
other
has
been
emphasised
by
his
enemies
his
conduct
towards
general
gordon
he
had
been
originally
opposed
to
gordon
appointment
but
he
had
consented
to
it
partly
perhaps
owing
to
the
persuasion
that
its
purpose
did
not
extend
beyond
the
making
of
a
gordon
once
gone
events
had
taken
their
own
course
the
policy
of
the
government
began
to
slide
automatically
down
a
slope
at
the
bottom
of
which
lay
the
conquest
of
the
sudan
and
the
annexation
of
egypt
sir
gerald
graham
bloody
victories
awoke
gladstone
to
the
true
condition
of
affairs
he
recognised
the
road
he
was
on
and
its
destination
but
there
was
still
time
to
turn
back
it
was
he
who
had
insisted
upon
the
withdrawal
of
the
english
army
from
the
eastern
sudan
the
imperialists
were
sadly
disappointed
they
had
supposed
that
the
old
lion
had
gone
to
sleep
and
suddenly
he
had
come
out
of
his
lair
and
was
roaring
all
their
hopes
now
centred
upon
khartoum
general
gordon
was
cut
off
he
was
surrounded
he
was
in
danger
he
must
be
relieved
a
british
force
must
be
sent
to
save
him
but
gladstone
was
not
to
be
caught
napping
a
second
time
when
the
agitation
rose
when
popular
sentiment
was
deeply
stirred
when
the
country
the
press
the
sovereign
herself
declared
that
the
national
honour
was
involved
with
the
fate
of
general
gordon
gladstone
remained
immovable
others
might
picture
the
triumphant
rescue
of
a
christian
hero
from
the
clutches
of
heathen
savages
before
his
eyes
was
the
vision
of
battle
murder
and
sudden
death
the
horrors
of
defeat
and
victory
the
slaughter
and
the
anguish
of
thousands
the
violence
of
military
domination
the
enslavement
of
a
people
the
invasion
of
the
sudan
he
had
flashed
out
in
the
house
of
commons
would
be
a
war
of
conquest
against
a
people
struggling
to
be
free
those
people
are
struggling
to
be
free
and
they
are
rightly
struggling
to
be
free
gladstone
it
was
one
of
his
simplicities
believed
in
liberty
if
indeed
it
should
turn
out
to
be
the
fact
that
general
gordon
was
in
serious
danger
then
no
doubt
it
would
be
necessary
to
send
a
relief
expedition
to
khartoum
but
he
could
see
no
sufficient
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
the
fact
communications
it
was
true
had
been
interrupted
between
khartoum
and
cairo
but
no
news
was
not
necessarily
bad
news
and
the
little
information
that
had
come
through
from
general
gordon
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
could
hold
out
for
months
so
his
agile
mind
worked
spinning
its
familiar
web
of
possibilities
and
contingencies
and
fine
distinctions
general
gordon
he
was
convinced
might
be
hemmed
in
but
he
was
not
surrounded
surely
it
was
the
duty
of
the
government
to
take
no
rash
step
but
to
consider
and
to
inquire
and
when
it
acted
to
act
upon
reasonable
conviction
and
then
there
was
another
question
if
it
was
true
and
he
believed
it
was
true
that
general
gordon
line
of
retreat
was
open
why
did
not
general
gordon
use
it
perhaps
he
might
be
unable
to
withdraw
the
egyptian
garrison
but
it
was
not
for
the
sake
of
the
egyptian
garrison
that
the
relief
expedition
was
proposed
it
was
simply
and
solely
to
secure
the
personal
safety
of
general
gordon
and
general
gordon
had
it
in
his
power
to
secure
his
personal
safety
himself
and
he
refused
to
do
so
he
lingered
on
in
khartoum
deliberately
wilfully
in
defiance
of
the
obvious
wishes
of
his
superiors
oh
it
was
perfectly
clear
what
general
gordon
was
doing
he
was
trying
to
force
the
hand
of
the
english
government
he
was
hoping
that
if
he
only
remained
long
enough
at
khartoum
he
would
oblige
the
english
government
to
send
an
army
into
the
sudan
which
should
smash
up
the
mahdi
that
then
was
general
gordon
calculation
well
general
gordon
would
learn
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
who
was
he
that
he
should
dare
to
imagine
that
he
could
impose
his
will
upon
gladstone
the
old
man
eyes
glared
if
it
came
to
a
struggle
between
them
well
they
should
see
as
the
weeks
passed
the
strange
situation
grew
tenser
it
was
like
some
silent
deadly
game
of
bluff
and
who
knows
what
was
passing
in
the
obscure
depths
of
that
terrifying
spirit
what
mysterious
mixture
of
remorse
rage
and
jealousy
who
was
it
that
was
ultimately
responsible
for
sending
general
gordon
to
khartoum
but
then
what
did
that
matter
why
did
not
the
man
come
back
he
was
a
christian
hero
was
he
were
there
no
other
christian
heroes
in
the
world
a
christian
hero
let
him
wait
until
the
mahdi
ring
was
really
round
him
until
the
mahdi
spear
was
really
about
to
fall
that
would
be
the
test
of
heroism
if
he
slipped
back
then
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
the
world
would
judge
one
of
the
last
telegrams
sent
by
gordon
before
the
wire
was
cut
seemed
to
support
exactly
gladstone
diagnosis
of
the
case
he
told
sir
evelyn
baring
that
since
the
government
refused
to
send
either
an
expedition
or
zobeir
he
would
himself
free
to
act
according
to
circumstances
he
said
will
be
forced
to
smash
up
the
mahdi
and
he
declared
that
if
the
government
persisted
in
its
present
line
of
conduct
it
would
be
branded
with
an
disgrace
the
message
was
made
public
and
it
happened
that
gladstone
saw
it
for
the
first
time
in
a
newspaper
during
a
country
visit
another
of
the
guests
who
was
in
the
room
at
the
moment
thus
describes
the
scene
took
up
the
paper
his
eye
instantly
fell
on
the
telegram
and
he
read
it
through
as
he
read
his
face
hardened
and
whitened
the
eyes
burned
as
i
have
seen
them
once
or
twice
in
the
house
of
commons
when
he
was
angered
burned
with
a
deep
fire
as
if
they
would
have
consumed
the
sheet
on
which
gordon
message
was
printed
or
as
if
gordon
words
had
burned
into
his
soul
which
was
looking
out
in
wrath
and
flame
he
said
not
a
word
for
perhaps
two
or
three
minutes
he
sat
still
his
face
all
the
while
like
the
face
you
may
read
of
in
milton
like
none
other
i
ever
saw
then
he
rose
still
without
a
word
and
was
seen
no
more
that
morning
it
is
curious
that
gordon
himself
never
understood
the
part
that
gladstone
was
playing
in
his
destiny
his
khartoum
journals
put
this
beyond
a
doubt
except
for
one
or
two
slight
and
jocular
references
to
gladstone
minor
idiosyncrasies
the
shape
of
his
collars
and
his
passion
for
felling
trees
gordon
leaves
him
unnoticed
while
he
lavishes
his
sardonic
humour
upon
lord
granville
but
in
truth
lord
granville
was
a
nonentity
the
error
shows
how
dim
the
realities
of
england
had
grown
to
the
watcher
in
khartoum
when
he
looked
towards
home
the
figure
that
loomed
largest
upon
his
vision
was
it
was
only
natural
that
it
should
have
been
so
the
nearest
it
was
upon
sir
evelyn
baring
that
he
fixed
his
gaze
for
him
sir
evelyn
baring
was
the
embodiment
of
england
or
rather
the
embodiment
of
the
english
official
classes
of
english
diplomacy
of
the
english
government
with
its
hesitations
its
insincerities
its
schemes
sir
evelyn
baring
he
almost
came
to
think
at
moments
was
the
prime
mover
the
sole
contriver
of
the
whole
sudan
imbroglio
in
this
he
was
wrong
for
sir
evelyn
baring
of
course
was
an
intermediary
without
final
responsibility
or
final
power
but
profound
antipathy
his
instinctive
distrust
were
not
without
their
justification
he
could
never
forget
that
first
meeting
in
cairo
six
years
earlier
when
the
fundamental
hostility
between
the
two
men
had
leapt
to
the
surface
oil
mixes
with
water
he
said
will
mix
together
sir
evelyn
baring
thought
so
too
but
he
did
not
say
so
it
was
not
his
way
when
he
spoke
he
felt
no
temptation
to
express
everything
that
was
in
his
mind
in
all
he
did
he
was
cautious
measured
unimpeachably
correct
it
would
be
difficult
to
think
of
a
man
more
completely
the
antithesis
of
gordon
his
temperament
all
in
monochrome
touched
in
with
cold
blues
and
indecisive
greys
was
eminently
unromantic
he
had
a
steely
colourlessness
and
a
steely
pliability
and
a
steely
strength
endowed
beyond
most
men
with
the
capacity
of
foresight
he
was
endowed
as
very
few
men
have
ever
been
with
that
which
makes
the
fruit
of
foresight
attainable
his
views
were
long
and
his
patience
was
even
longer
he
progressed
imperceptibly
he
constantly
withdrew
the
art
of
giving
way
he
practised
with
the
refinement
of
a
virtuoso
but
though
the
steel
recoiled
and
recoiled
in
the
end
it
would
spring
forward
his
work
had
in
it
an
element
of
paradox
it
was
passed
entirely
in
the
east
and
the
east
meant
very
little
to
him
he
took
no
interest
in
it
it
was
something
to
be
looked
after
it
was
also
a
convenient
field
for
the
talents
of
sir
evelyn
baring
yet
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
he
was
cynical
perhaps
he
was
not
quite
great
enough
for
that
he
looked
forward
to
a
pleasant
retirement
a
country
place
some
literary
recreations
he
had
been
careful
to
keep
up
his
classics
his
ambition
can
be
stated
in
a
single
phrase
it
was
to
become
an
institution
and
he
achieved
it
no
doubt
too
he
deserved
it
the
greatest
of
poets
in
a
bitter
mood
has
described
the
characteristics
of
a
certain
class
of
persons
whom
he
did
not
like
he
says
have
power
to
hurt
and
will
do
none
that
do
not
do
the
things
they
most
do
show
who
moving
others
are
themselves
as
stone
unmoved
cold
and
to
temptation
slow
they
rightly
do
inherit
heaven
graces
and
husband
nature
riches
from
expense
they
are
the
lords
and
owners
of
their
faces
the
words
might
have
been
written
for
sir
evelyn
baring
though
as
a
rule
he
found
it
easy
to
despise
those
with
whom
he
came
into
contact
he
could
not
altogether
despise
general
gordon
if
he
could
have
he
would
have
disliked
him
less
he
had
gone
as
far
as
his
caution
had
allowed
him
in
trying
to
prevent
the
fatal
appointment
and
then
when
it
had
become
clear
that
the
government
was
insistent
he
had
yielded
with
a
good
grace
for
a
moment
he
had
imagined
that
all
might
yet
be
well
that
he
could
impose
himself
by
the
weight
of
his
position
and
the
force
of
his
sagacity
upon
his
subordinate
that
he
could
hold
him
in
a
leash
at
the
end
of
the
telegraph
wire
to
khartoum
very
soon
he
perceived
that
this
was
a
miscalculation
to
his
disgust
he
found
that
the
telegraph
wire
far
from
being
an
instrument
of
official
discipline
had
been
converted
by
the
agile
strategist
at
the
other
end
of
it
into
a
means
of
extending
his
own
personality
into
the
deliberations
at
cairo
every
morning
sir
evelyn
baring
would
find
upon
his
table
a
great
pile
of
telegrams
from
khartoum
twenty
or
thirty
at
least
and
as
the
day
went
on
the
pile
would
grow
when
a
sufficient
number
had
accumulated
he
would
read
them
all
through
with
the
greatest
care
there
upon
the
table
the
whole
soul
of
gordon
lay
before
him
in
its
incoherence
its
eccentricity
its
impulsiveness
its
romance
the
jokes
the
slang
the
appeals
to
the
prophet
isaiah
the
whirl
of
contradictory
policies
sir
evelyn
baring
did
not
know
which
exasperated
him
most
he
would
not
consider
whether
or
to
what
degree
the
man
was
a
maniac
no
he
would
not
a
subacid
smile
was
the
only
comment
he
allowed
himself
his
position
indeed
was
an
extremely
difficult
one
and
all
his
dexterity
would
be
needed
if
he
was
to
emerge
from
it
with
credit
on
one
side
of
him
was
a
veering
and
vacillating
government
on
the
other
a
frenzied
enthusiast
it
was
his
business
to
interpret
to
the
first
the
wishes
or
rather
the
inspirations
of
the
second
and
to
convey
to
the
second
the
decisions
or
rather
the
indecisions
of
the
first
a
weaker
man
would
have
floated
helplessly
on
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
cabinet
wavering
policies
a
rasher
man
would
have
plunged
headlong
into
gordon
schemes
he
did
neither
with
a
singular
courage
and
a
singular
caution
he
progressed
along
a
he
devoted
all
his
energies
to
the
double
task
of
evolving
a
reasonable
policy
out
of
gordon
intoxicated
telegrams
and
of
inducing
the
divided
ministers
at
home
to
give
their
sanction
to
what
he
had
evolved
he
might
have
succeeded
if
he
had
not
had
to
reckon
with
yet
another
irreconcilable
time
was
a
vital
element
in
the
situation
and
time
was
against
him
when
the
tribes
round
khartoum
rose
the
last
hope
of
a
satisfactory
solution
vanished
he
was
the
first
to
perceive
the
altered
condition
of
affairs
long
before
the
government
long
before
gordon
himself
he
understood
that
the
only
remaining
question
was
that
of
the
extrication
of
the
englishmen
from
khartoum
he
proposed
that
a
small
force
should
be
dispatched
at
once
across
the
desert
from
suakin
to
barber
the
point
on
the
nile
nearest
to
the
red
sea
and
thence
up
the
river
to
gordon
but
after
considerable
hesitation
the
military
authorities
decided
that
this
was
not
a
practicable
plan
upon
that
he
foresaw
with
perfect
lucidity
the
inevitable
development
of
events
sooner
or
later
it
would
be
absolutely
necessary
to
send
a
relief
expedition
to
khartoum
and
from
that
premise
it
followed
without
a
possibility
of
doubt
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
government
to
do
so
at
once
this
he
saw
quite
clearly
but
he
also
saw
that
the
position
in
the
cabinet
had
now
altered
that
gladstone
had
taken
the
reins
into
his
own
hands
and
gladstone
did
not
wish
to
send
a
relief
expedition
what
was
sir
evelyn
baring
to
do
was
he
to
pit
his
strength
against
gladstone
to
threaten
resignation
to
stake
his
whole
future
upon
general
fate
for
a
moment
he
wavered
he
seemed
to
hint
that
unless
the
government
sent
a
message
to
khartoum
promising
a
relief
expedition
before
the
end
of
the
year
he
would
be
unable
to
be
a
party
to
their
acts
the
government
refused
to
send
any
such
message
and
he
perceived
as
he
tells
us
that
was
evidently
useless
to
continue
the
correspondence
any
further
after
all
what
could
he
do
he
was
still
only
a
secondary
figure
his
resignation
would
be
accepted
he
would
be
given
a
colonial
governorship
and
gordon
would
be
no
nearer
safety
but
then
could
he
sit
by
and
witness
a
horrible
catastrophe
without
lifting
a
hand
of
all
the
odious
dilemmas
which
that
man
had
put
him
into
this
he
reflected
was
the
most
odious
he
slightly
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
he
might
have
to
hurt
but
he
would
none
he
wrote
a
dispatch
a
long
balanced
guarded
grey
dispatch
informing
the
government
that
he
to
think
that
it
was
question
worthy
of
consideration
whether
the
naval
and
military
authorities
should
not
take
some
preliminary
steps
in
the
way
of
preparing
boats
so
as
to
be
able
to
move
should
the
necessity
arise
then
within
a
week
before
the
receipt
of
the
government
answer
he
left
egypt
from
the
end
of
april
until
the
beginning
of
september
during
the
most
momentous
period
of
the
whole
crisis
he
was
engaged
in
london
upon
a
financial
conference
while
his
place
was
taken
in
cairo
by
a
substitute
with
a
characteristically
convenient
unobtrusiveness
sir
evelyn
baring
had
vanished
from
the
scene
meanwhile
far
to
the
southward
over
the
lands
watered
by
the
upper
nile
and
its
tributaries
the
power
and
the
glory
of
him
who
had
once
been
mohammed
ahmed
were
growing
still
in
the
the
last
embers
of
resistance
were
stamped
out
with
the
capture
of
lupton
bey
and
through
the
whole
of
that
vast
province
three
times
the
size
of
england
every
trace
of
the
egyptian
government
was
obliterated
still
farther
south
the
same
fate
was
rapidly
overtaking
equatoria
where
emir
pasha
withdrawing
into
the
unexplored
depths
of
central
africa
carried
with
him
the
last
vestiges
of
the
old
order
the
mahdi
himself
still
lingered
in
his
headquarters
at
el
obeid
but
on
the
rising
of
the
tribes
round
khartoum
he
had
decided
that
the
time
for
an
offensive
movement
had
come
and
had
dispatched
an
arm
of
men
to
lay
siege
to
the
city
at
the
same
time
in
a
long
and
elaborate
proclamation
in
which
he
asserted
with
all
the
elegance
of
oriental
rhetoric
both
the
sanctity
of
his
mission
and
the
invincibility
of
his
troops
he
called
upon
the
inhabitants
to
surrender
gordon
read
aloud
the
summons
to
the
assembled
townspeople
with
one
voice
they
declared
that
they
were
ready
to
resist
this
was
a
false
mahdi
they
said
god
would
defend
the
right
they
put
their
trust
in
the
the
most
learned
sheikh
in
the
town
drew
up
a
theological
reply
pointing
out
that
the
mahdi
did
not
fulfil
the
requirements
of
the
ancient
prophets
at
his
appearance
had
the
euphrates
dried
up
and
revealed
a
hill
of
gold
had
contradiction
and
difference
ceased
upon
the
earth
and
moreover
did
not
the
faithful
know
that
the
true
mahdi
was
born
in
the
year
of
the
prophet
from
which
it
surely
followed
that
he
must
be
now
years
old
and
was
it
not
clear
to
all
men
that
this
pretender
was
not
a
tenth
of
that
age
these
arguments
were
certainly
forcible
but
the
mahdi
army
was
more
forcible
still
the
besieged
sallied
out
to
the
attack
they
were
defeated
and
the
rout
that
followed
was
so
disgraceful
that
two
of
the
commanding
officers
were
by
gordon
orders
executed
as
traitors
from
that
moment
the
regular
investment
of
khartoum
began
the
arab
generals
decided
to
starve
the
town
into
submission
when
after
a
few
weeks
of
doubt
it
became
certain
that
no
british
force
was
on
its
way
from
suakin
to
smash
up
the
mahdi
and
when
at
the
end
of
may
berber
the
last
connecting
link
between
khartoum
and
the
outside
world
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
gordon
set
his
teeth
and
sat
down
to
wait
and
to
hope
as
best
he
might
with
unceasing
energy
he
devoted
himself
to
the
strengthening
of
his
defences
and
the
organisation
of
his
resources
to
the
digging
of
earthworks
the
manufacture
of
ammunition
the
collection
and
the
distribution
of
food
every
day
there
were
sallies
and
skirmishes
every
day
his
little
armoured
steamboats
paddled
up
and
down
the
river
scattering
death
and
terror
as
they
went
whatever
the
emergency
he
was
ready
with
devices
and
expedients
when
the
earthworks
were
still
uncompleted
he
procured
hundreds
of
yards
of
cotton
which
he
dyed
the
colour
of
earth
and
spread
out
in
long
sloping
lines
so
as
to
deceive
the
arabs
while
the
real
works
were
being
prepared
farther
back
when
a
lack
of
money
began
to
make
itself
felt
he
printed
and
circulated
a
paper
coinage
of
his
own
to
combat
the
growing
discontent
and
disaffection
of
the
townspeople
he
instituted
a
system
of
orders
and
medals
the
women
were
not
forgotten
and
his
popularity
redoubled
there
was
terror
in
the
thought
that
harm
might
come
to
the
awe
and
reverence
followed
him
wherever
he
went
he
was
surrounded
by
a
vigilant
and
jealous
guard
like
some
precious
idol
some
mascot
of
victory
how
could
he
go
away
how
could
he
desert
his
people
it
was
impossible
it
would
be
as
he
himself
exclaimed
in
one
of
his
latest
telegrams
to
sir
evelyn
baring
climax
of
meanness
even
to
contemplate
such
an
act
sir
evelyn
baring
thought
differently
in
his
opinion
it
was
general
gordon
plain
duty
to
have
come
away
from
khartoum
to
stay
involved
inevitably
a
relief
expedition
a
great
expense
of
treasure
and
the
loss
of
valuable
lives
to
come
away
would
merely
mean
that
the
inhabitants
of
khartoum
would
be
prisoner
by
the
mahdi
so
sir
evelyn
baring
put
it
but
the
case
was
not
quite
so
simple
as
that
when
berber
fell
there
had
been
a
massacre
lasting
for
days
an
appalling
orgy
of
loot
and
lust
and
slaughter
when
khartoum
itself
was
captured
what
followed
was
still
more
terrible
decidedly
it
was
no
child
play
to
be
prisoner
by
the
mahdi
and
gordon
was
actually
there
among
those
people
in
closest
intercourse
with
them
responsible
beloved
yes
no
doubt
but
was
that
in
truth
his
only
motive
did
he
not
wish
in
reality
by
lingering
in
khartoum
to
force
the
hand
of
the
government
to
oblige
them
whether
they
would
or
no
to
send
an
army
to
smash
up
the
mahdi
and
was
that
fair
was
that
his
duty
he
might
protest
with
his
last
breath
that
he
had
to
do
his
duty
sir
evelyn
baring
at
any
rate
would
not
agree
but
sir
evelyn
baring
was
inaudible
and
gordon
now
cared
very
little
for
his
opinions
is
it
possible
that
if
only
for
a
moment
in
his
extraordinary
predicament
he
may
have
listened
to
another
and
a
very
different
voice
a
voice
of
singular
quality
a
voice
which
for
so
one
would
fain
imagine
may
well
have
wakened
some
familiar
echoes
in
his
heart
one
day
he
received
a
private
letter
from
the
mahdi
the
letter
was
accompanied
by
a
small
bundle
of
clothes
the
name
of
god
wrote
the
mahdi
a
suit
of
clothes
consisting
of
a
coat
jibbeh
an
overcoat
a
turban
a
cap
a
girdle
and
beads
this
is
the
clothing
of
those
who
have
given
up
this
world
and
its
vanities
and
who
look
for
the
world
to
come
for
everlasting
happiness
in
paradise
if
you
truly
desire
to
come
to
god
and
seek
to
live
a
godly
life
you
must
at
once
wear
this
suit
and
come
out
to
accept
your
everlasting
good
fortune
did
the
words
bear
no
meaning
to
the
mystic
of
gravesend
but
he
was
an
english
gentleman
an
english
officer
he
flung
the
clothes
to
the
ground
and
trampled
on
them
in
the
sight
of
all
then
alone
he
went
up
to
the
roof
of
his
high
palace
and
turned
the
telescope
once
more
almost
mechanically
towards
the
north
but
nothing
broke
the
immovability
of
that
hard
horizon
and
indeed
how
was
it
possible
that
help
should
come
to
him
now
he
seemed
to
be
utterly
abandoned
sir
evelyn
baring
had
disappeared
into
his
financial
conference
in
england
gladstone
had
held
firm
had
outfaced
the
house
of
commons
had
ignored
the
press
he
appeared
to
have
triumphed
though
it
was
clear
that
no
preparations
of
any
kind
were
being
made
for
the
relief
of
gordon
the
anxiety
and
agitation
of
the
public
which
had
risen
so
suddenly
to
such
a
height
of
vehemence
had
died
down
the
dangerous
beast
had
been
quelled
by
the
stern
eye
of
its
master
other
questions
became
more
interesting
the
reform
bill
the
russians
the
house
of
lords
gordon
silent
in
khartoum
had
almost
dropped
out
of
remembrance
and
yet
help
did
come
after
all
and
it
came
from
an
unexpected
quarter
lord
hartington
had
been
for
some
time
convinced
that
he
was
responsible
for
gordon
appointment
and
his
conscience
was
beginning
to
grow
uncomfortable
lord
hartington
conscience
was
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
of
him
it
was
not
like
gladstone
a
an
intangible
dangerous
creature
that
loved
to
live
in
the
fire
nor
was
it
like
gordon
a
restless
conscience
nor
like
sir
evelyn
baring
a
diplomatic
conscience
it
was
a
commonplace
affair
lord
hartington
himself
would
have
been
disgusted
by
any
mention
of
it
if
he
had
been
obliged
he
would
have
alluded
to
it
distantly
he
would
have
muttered
that
it
was
a
bore
not
to
do
the
proper
thing
he
was
usually
bored
for
one
reason
or
another
but
this
particular
form
of
boredom
he
found
more
intense
than
all
the
rest
he
would
take
endless
pains
to
avoid
it
of
course
the
whole
thing
was
a
nuisance
an
obvious
nuisance
and
everyone
else
must
feel
just
as
he
did
about
it
and
yet
people
seemed
to
have
got
it
into
their
heads
that
he
had
some
kind
of
special
faculty
in
such
matters
that
there
was
some
peculiar
value
in
his
judgment
on
a
question
of
right
and
wrong
he
could
not
understand
why
it
was
but
whenever
there
was
a
dispute
about
cards
in
a
club
it
was
brought
to
him
to
settle
it
was
most
odd
but
it
was
trite
in
public
affairs
no
less
than
in
private
lord
hartington
decisions
carried
an
extraordinary
weight
the
feeling
of
his
idle
friends
in
high
society
was
shared
by
the
great
mass
of
the
english
people
here
was
a
man
they
could
trust
for
indeed
he
was
built
upon
a
pattern
which
was
very
dear
to
his
countrymen
it
was
not
simply
that
he
was
honest
it
was
that
his
honesty
was
an
english
honesty
an
honest
which
naturally
belonged
to
one
who
so
it
seemed
to
them
was
the
living
image
of
what
an
englishman
should
be
in
lord
hartington
they
saw
embodied
and
glorified
the
very
qualities
which
were
nearest
to
their
hearts
impartiality
solidity
common
sense
the
qualities
by
which
they
themselves
longed
to
be
distinguished
and
by
which
in
their
happier
moments
they
believed
they
were
if
ever
they
began
to
have
misgivings
there
at
any
rate
was
the
example
of
lord
hartington
to
encourage
them
and
guide
them
lord
hartington
who
was
never
who
was
never
excited
and
who
had
no
imagination
at
all
everything
they
knew
about
him
fitted
into
the
picture
adding
to
their
admiration
and
respect
his
fondness
for
field
sports
gave
them
a
feeling
of
security
and
certainly
there
could
be
no
nonsense
about
a
man
who
confessed
to
two
ambitions
to
become
prime
minister
and
to
win
the
derby
and
who
put
the
second
above
the
first
they
loved
him
for
his
casualness
for
his
inexactness
for
refusing
to
make
life
a
business
for
ramming
an
official
dispatch
of
high
importance
into
his
and
finding
it
there
still
unopened
at
newmarket
several
days
later
they
loved
him
for
his
hatred
of
fine
sentiments
they
were
delighted
when
they
heard
that
at
some
function
on
a
florid
speaker
avowing
that
was
the
proudest
moment
of
his
life
lord
hartington
had
growled
in
an
undertone
proudest
moment
of
my
life
was
when
my
pig
won
the
prize
at
skipton
fair
above
all
they
loved
him
for
being
dull
it
was
the
greatest
comfort
with
lord
hartington
they
could
always
be
absolutely
certain
that
he
would
never
in
any
circumstances
be
either
brilliant
or
subtle
or
surprising
or
impassioned
or
profound
as
they
sat
listening
to
his
speeches
in
which
considerations
of
stolid
plainness
succeeded
one
another
with
complete
flatness
they
felt
involved
and
supported
by
the
colossal
tedium
that
their
confidence
was
finally
assured
they
looked
up
and
took
their
fill
of
the
sturdy
obvious
presence
the
inheritor
of
a
splendid
dukedom
might
almost
have
passed
for
a
farm
hand
almost
but
not
quite
for
an
air
that
was
difficult
to
explain
of
preponderating
authority
lurked
in
the
solid
figure
and
the
lordly
breeding
of
the
house
of
cavendish
was
visible
in
the
large
long
bearded
unimpressionable
face
one
other
characteristic
the
necessary
consequence
or
indeed
it
might
almost
be
said
the
essential
expression
of
all
the
rest
completes
the
portrait
lord
hartington
was
slow
he
was
slow
in
movement
slow
in
apprehension
slow
in
thought
and
the
communication
of
thought
slow
to
decide
and
slow
to
act
more
than
once
this
disposition
exercised
a
profound
effect
upon
his
career
a
private
individual
may
perhaps
be
slow
with
impunity
but
a
statesman
who
is
slow
whatever
the
force
of
his
character
and
the
strength
of
his
judgment
can
hardly
escape
unhurt
from
the
hurrying
of
time
winged
chariot
can
hardly
hope
to
avoid
some
grave
disaster
or
some
irretrievable
mistake
the
fate
of
general
gordon
so
intricately
interwoven
with
such
a
mass
of
complicated
circumstance
with
the
policies
of
england
and
of
egypt
with
the
fanaticism
of
the
mahdi
with
the
irreproachability
of
sir
evelyn
baring
with
mysterious
passions
was
finally
determined
by
the
fact
that
lord
hartington
was
slow
if
he
had
been
even
a
very
little
quicker
if
he
had
been
quicker
by
two
days
but
it
could
not
be
the
ponderous
machinery
took
so
long
to
set
itself
in
motion
the
great
wheels
and
levers
once
started
revolved
with
such
a
laborious
such
a
painful
deliberation
that
at
last
their
work
was
accomplished
surely
firmly
completely
in
the
best
english
manner
and
too
late
seven
stages
may
be
discerned
in
the
history
of
lord
influence
upon
the
fate
of
general
gordon
at
the
end
of
the
first
stage
he
had
become
convinced
that
he
was
responsible
for
appointment
to
khartoum
at
the
end
of
the
second
he
had
perceived
that
his
conscience
would
not
allow
him
to
remain
inactive
in
the
face
of
gordon
danger
at
the
end
of
the
third
he
had
made
an
attempt
to
induce
the
cabinet
to
send
an
expedition
to
gordon
relief
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
he
had
realised
that
the
cabinet
had
decided
to
postpone
the
relief
of
gordon
indefinitely
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
must
put
pressure
upon
gladstone
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
he
had
attempted
to
put
pressure
upon
gladstone
and
had
not
succeeded
at
the
end
of
the
seventh
he
had
succeeded
in
putting
pressure
upon
gladstone
the
relief
expedition
had
been
ordered
he
could
do
no
more
the
in
this
long
and
extraordinary
process
occurred
towards
the
end
of
april
when
the
cabinet
after
the
receipt
of
sir
evelyn
baring
final
dispatch
decided
to
take
no
immediate
measures
for
gordon
relief
from
that
moment
it
was
clear
that
there
was
only
one
course
open
to
lord
hartington
to
tell
gladstone
that
he
would
resign
unless
a
relief
expedition
was
sent
but
it
took
him
more
than
three
months
to
come
to
this
conclusion
he
always
found
the
proceedings
at
cabinet
meetings
particularly
hard
to
follow
the
interchange
of
question
and
answer
of
proposal
and
counterproposal
the
crowded
counsellors
gladstone
subtleties
the
abrupt
and
complicated
resolutions
these
things
invariably
left
him
confused
and
perplexed
after
the
crucial
cabinet
at
the
end
of
april
he
came
away
in
a
state
of
uncertainty
as
to
what
had
occurred
he
had
to
write
to
lord
granville
to
find
out
and
by
that
time
of
course
the
decision
had
been
telegraphed
to
egypt
three
weeks
later
in
the
middle
of
may
he
had
grown
so
uneasy
that
he
felt
himself
obliged
to
address
a
circular
letter
to
the
cabinet
proposing
that
preparations
for
a
relief
expedition
should
be
set
on
foot
at
once
and
then
he
began
to
understand
that
nothing
would
ever
be
done
until
gladstone
by
some
means
or
other
had
been
forced
to
give
his
consent
a
singular
combat
followed
the
slippery
old
man
perpetually
eluded
the
cumbrous
grasp
of
his
antagonist
he
delayed
he
postponed
he
raised
interminable
difficulties
he
prevaricated
he
was
silent
he
disappeared
lord
hartington
was
dauntless
gradually
inch
by
inch
he
drove
the
prime
minister
into
a
corner
but
in
the
meantime
many
weeks
had
passed
on
july
lord
hartington
was
still
remarking
that
he
did
not
feel
that
he
knew
the
mind
or
intention
of
the
government
in
respect
of
the
relief
of
general
gordon
the
month
was
spent
in
a
succession
of
stubborn
efforts
to
wring
from
gladstone
some
definite
statement
upon
the
question
it
was
useless
on
july
lord
hartington
did
the
deed
he
stated
that
unless
an
expedition
was
sent
he
would
resign
it
was
he
said
question
of
personal
honour
and
good
faith
and
i
see
how
i
can
yield
upon
it
his
conscience
had
worked
itself
to
rest
at
last
when
gladstone
read
the
words
he
realised
that
the
game
was
over
lord
hartington
position
in
the
liberal
party
was
second
only
to
his
own
he
was
the
leader
of
the
rich
and
powerful
whig
aristocracy
his
influence
with
the
country
was
immense
nor
was
he
the
man
to
make
idle
threats
of
resignation
he
had
said
he
would
resign
and
resign
he
would
the
collapse
of
the
government
would
be
the
inevitable
result
on
august
therefore
parliament
was
asked
to
make
a
grant
of
in
order
enable
her
majesty
government
to
undertake
operations
for
the
relief
of
general
gordon
should
they
become
necessary
the
money
was
voted
and
even
then
at
that
last
hour
gladstone
made
another
final
desperate
twist
trying
to
save
himself
by
the
proviso
which
he
had
inserted
into
the
resolution
he
declared
that
he
was
still
unconvinced
of
the
necessity
of
any
operations
at
all
nearly
he
wrote
to
lord
hartington
not
quite
adopt
words
received
today
from
granville
it
is
clear
i
think
that
gordon
has
our
messages
and
does
not
choose
to
answer
them
nearly
but
not
quite
the
qualification
was
masterly
but
it
was
of
no
avail
this
time
the
sinuous
creature
was
held
by
too
firm
a
grasp
on
august
lord
wolseley
was
appointed
to
command
the
relief
expedition
and
on
september
he
arrived
in
egypt
the
relief
expedition
had
begun
and
at
the
same
moment
a
new
phase
opened
at
khartoum
the
annual
rising
of
the
nile
was
now
sufficiently
advanced
to
enable
one
of
gordon
small
steamers
to
pass
over
the
cataracts
down
to
egypt
in
safety
he
determined
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
laying
before
the
authorities
in
cairo
and
london
and
the
english
public
at
large
an
exact
account
of
his
position
a
cargo
of
documents
including
colonel
stewart
diary
of
the
siege
and
a
personal
appeal
for
assistance
addressed
by
gordon
to
all
the
european
powers
was
placed
on
board
the
abbas
four
other
steamers
were
to
accompany
her
until
she
was
out
of
danger
from
attacks
by
the
troops
after
which
she
was
to
proceed
alone
into
egypt
on
the
evening
of
september
just
as
she
was
about
to
start
the
english
and
french
consuls
asked
for
permission
to
go
with
her
a
permission
which
gordon
who
had
long
been
anxious
to
provide
for
their
safety
readily
granted
then
colonel
stewart
made
the
same
request
and
gordon
consented
with
the
same
alacrity
colonel
stewart
was
the
at
khartoum
and
it
seems
strange
that
he
should
have
made
a
proposal
which
would
leave
gordon
in
a
position
of
the
gravest
anxiety
without
a
single
european
subordinate
but
his
motives
were
to
be
veiled
forever
in
a
tragic
obscurity
the
abbas
and
her
convoy
set
out
henceforward
the
was
alone
he
had
now
definitely
and
finally
made
his
decision
colonel
stewart
and
his
companions
had
gone
with
every
prospect
of
returning
unharmed
to
civilisation
gladstone
belief
was
justified
so
far
as
gordon
personal
safety
was
concerned
he
might
still
at
this
late
hour
have
secured
it
but
he
had
chosen
he
stayed
at
khartoum
no
sooner
were
the
steamers
out
of
sight
than
he
sat
down
at
his
and
began
that
daily
record
of
his
circumstances
his
reflections
and
his
feelings
which
reveals
to
us
with
such
an
authentic
exactitude
the
final
period
of
his
extraordinary
destiny
his
journals
sent
down
the
river
in
batches
to
await
the
coming
of
the
relief
expedition
and
addressed
first
to
colonel
stewart
and
later
to
the
of
staff
sudan
expeditionary
force
were
official
documents
intended
for
publication
though
as
gordon
himself
was
careful
to
note
on
the
outer
covers
they
would
pruning
before
they
were
printed
he
also
wrote
on
the
envelope
of
the
first
section
secrets
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
a
more
singular
set
of
state
papers
was
never
compiled
sitting
there
in
the
solitude
of
his
palace
with
ruin
closing
round
him
with
anxieties
on
every
hand
with
doom
hanging
above
his
head
he
let
his
pen
rush
on
for
hour
after
hour
in
an
ecstasy
of
communication
a
tireless
unburdening
of
the
spirit
where
the
most
trivial
incidents
of
the
passing
day
were
mingled
with
philosophical
disquisitions
where
jests
and
anger
hopes
and
terrors
elaborate
justifications
and
cynical
confessions
jostled
one
another
in
reckless
confusion
the
impulsive
demonstrative
man
had
nobody
to
talk
to
any
more
and
so
he
talked
instead
to
the
pile
of
telegraph
forms
which
useless
now
for
perplexing
sir
evelyn
baring
served
very
well
for
they
were
large
and
blank
as
the
repositories
of
his
conversation
his
tone
was
not
the
intimate
and
religious
tone
which
he
would
have
used
with
the
rev
barnes
or
his
sister
augusta
it
was
such
as
must
have
been
habitual
with
him
in
his
intercourse
with
old
friends
or
whose
religious
views
were
of
a
more
ordinary
caste
than
his
own
but
with
whom
he
was
on
confidential
terms
he
was
anxious
to
put
his
case
to
a
select
and
sympathetic
audience
to
convince
such
a
man
as
lord
wolseley
that
he
was
justified
in
what
he
had
done
and
he
was
sparing
in
his
allusions
to
the
hand
of
providence
while
those
mysterious
doubts
and
piercing
introspections
which
must
have
filled
him
he
almost
entirely
concealed
he
expressed
himself
of
course
with
eccentric
abandon
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
do
otherwise
but
he
was
content
to
indicate
his
deepest
feelings
with
a
fleer
yet
sometimes
as
one
can
imagine
happening
with
him
in
actual
conversation
his
utterance
took
the
form
of
a
a
copious
outpouring
addressed
to
himself
more
than
to
anyone
else
for
his
own
satisfaction
there
are
passages
in
the
khartoum
journals
which
call
up
in
a
flash
the
light
gliding
figure
and
the
blue
eyes
with
the
candour
of
childhood
still
shining
in
them
one
can
almost
hear
the
low
voice
the
singularly
distinct
articulation
the
persuasive
the
sentences
following
each
other
so
unassumingly
between
the
puffs
of
a
cigarette
as
he
wrote
two
preoccupations
principally
filled
his
mind
his
reflections
revolved
around
the
immediate
past
and
the
impending
future
with
an
unerring
persistency
he
examined
he
excused
he
explained
his
share
in
the
complicated
events
which
had
led
to
his
present
situation
he
rebutted
the
charges
of
imaginary
enemies
he
laid
bare
the
ineptitude
and
the
faithlessness
of
the
english
government
he
poured
out
his
satire
upon
officials
and
diplomatists
he
drew
caricatures
in
the
margin
of
sir
evelyn
baring
with
sentences
of
shocked
pomposity
coming
out
of
his
mouth
in
some
passages
which
the
editor
of
the
journals
preferred
to
suppress
he
covered
lord
granville
with
his
raillery
picturing
the
foreign
secretary
lounging
away
his
morning
at
walmer
castle
opening
the
times
and
suddenly
discovering
to
his
horror
that
khartoum
was
still
holding
out
he
said
distinctly
he
could
only
hold
out
six
months
and
that
was
in
march
counts
the
months
august
why
he
ought
to
have
given
in
what
is
to
be
done
they
be
howling
for
an
expedition
it
is
no
laughing
matter
that
abominable
mahdi
why
on
earth
does
he
not
guard
his
roads
better
what
is
to
be
done
several
times
in
his
bitterness
he
repeats
the
suggestion
that
the
authorities
at
home
were
secretly
hoping
that
the
fall
of
khartoum
would
relieve
them
of
their
difficulties
that
mahdi
is
about
lord
granville
is
made
to
exclaim
in
another
deleted
paragraph
can
not
make
out
why
does
he
not
put
all
his
guns
on
the
river
and
stop
the
route
eh
what
we
will
have
to
go
to
khartoum
why
it
will
cost
millions
what
a
wretched
business
what
send
zobeir
our
conscience
recoils
from
that
it
is
elastic
but
not
equal
to
that
it
is
a
pact
with
the
devil
do
you
not
think
there
is
any
way
of
getting
hold
of
h
i
m
in
a
quiet
way
if
a
boy
at
eton
or
harrow
he
declared
had
acted
as
the
government
had
acted
think
he
would
be
kicked
and
i
am
sure
he
would
deserve
it
he
was
the
victim
of
hypocrites
and
humbugs
there
was
sort
of
parallel
to
all
this
in
history
except
david
with
uriah
the
hittite
but
then
was
an
eve
in
the
case
and
he
was
not
aware
that
the
government
had
even
that
excuse
from
the
past
he
turned
to
the
future
and
surveyed
with
a
disturbed
and
piercing
vision
the
possibilities
before
him
supposing
that
the
relief
expedition
arrived
what
would
be
his
position
upon
one
thing
he
was
determined
whatever
happened
he
would
not
play
the
part
of
rescued
lamb
he
vehemently
asserted
that
the
purpose
of
the
expedition
could
only
be
the
relief
of
the
sudan
garrisons
it
was
monstrous
to
imagine
that
it
had
been
undertaken
merely
to
ensure
his
personal
safety
he
refused
to
believe
it
in
any
case
declare
positively
he
wrote
with
passionate
underlinings
once
for
all
that
i
will
not
leave
the
sudan
until
every
one
who
wants
to
go
down
is
given
the
chance
to
do
so
unless
a
government
is
established
which
relieves
me
of
the
charge
therefore
if
any
emissary
or
letter
comes
up
here
ordering
me
to
comedown
i
will
not
obey
it
but
will
stay
here
and
fall
with
the
town
and
run
all
risks
this
was
sheer
insubordination
no
doubt
but
he
could
not
help
that
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
be
obedient
know
if
i
was
chief
i
would
never
employ
myself
for
i
am
incorrigible
decidedly
he
was
not
afraid
to
be
club
men
call
insubordinate
though
of
all
insubordinates
the
club
men
are
the
worst
as
for
the
government
which
was
to
replace
him
there
were
several
alternatives
an
egyptian
pasha
might
succeed
him
as
or
zobeir
might
be
appointed
after
all
or
the
whole
country
might
be
handed
over
to
the
sultan
his
fertile
imagination
evolved
scheme
after
scheme
and
his
visions
of
his
own
future
were
equally
various
he
would
withdraw
to
the
equator
he
would
be
delighted
to
spend
christmas
in
brussels
he
would
at
any
rate
he
would
never
go
back
to
england
that
was
certain
dwell
on
the
joy
of
never
seeing
great
britain
again
with
its
horrid
wearisome
and
miseries
how
we
can
put
up
with
those
things
passes
my
imagination
it
is
a
perfect
bondage
i
would
sooner
live
a
dervish
with
the
mahdi
than
go
out
to
dinner
every
night
in
london
i
hope
if
any
english
general
comes
to
khartoum
he
will
not
ask
me
to
dinner
why
men
can
not
be
friends
without
bringing
the
wretched
stomachs
in
is
astounding
but
would
an
english
general
ever
have
the
opportunity
of
asking
him
to
dinner
in
khartoum
there
were
moments
when
terrible
misgivings
assailed
him
he
pieced
together
his
scraps
of
intelligence
with
feverish
exactitude
he
calculated
times
distances
marches
he
wrote
on
october
they
do
not
come
before
november
the
game
is
up
and
rule
britannia
curious
premonitions
came
into
his
mind
when
he
heard
that
the
mahdi
was
approaching
in
person
it
seemed
to
be
the
fulfilment
of
a
destiny
for
he
had
felt
we
were
doomed
to
come
face
to
face
what
would
be
the
end
of
it
all
is
of
course
on
the
cards
he
noted
khartoum
is
taken
under
the
nose
of
the
expeditionary
force
which
will
be
just
too
late
the
splendid
hawks
that
swooped
about
the
palace
reminded
him
of
a
text
in
the
bible
eye
that
mocketh
at
his
father
and
despiseth
to
obey
his
mother
the
ravens
of
the
valley
shall
pick
it
out
and
the
young
eagles
shall
eat
it
often
wonder
he
wrote
they
are
destined
to
pick
my
eyes
for
i
fear
i
was
not
the
best
of
sons
so
sitting
late
into
the
night
he
filled
the
empty
telegraph
forms
with
the
agitations
of
his
spirit
overflowing
ever
more
hurriedly
more
furiously
with
lines
of
emphasis
and
capitals
and
more
and
more
thickly
interspersed
so
that
the
signs
of
his
living
passion
are
still
visible
to
the
inquirer
of
today
on
those
thin
sheets
of
mediocre
paper
and
in
the
torrent
of
the
ink
but
he
was
a
man
of
elastic
temperament
he
could
not
remain
forever
upon
the
stretch
he
sought
and
he
found
relaxation
in
extraneous
matters
in
metaphysical
digressions
or
in
satirical
outbursts
or
in
the
small
details
of
his
daily
life
it
amused
him
to
have
the
sudanese
soldiers
brought
in
and
shown
their
pug
faces
in
the
palace
he
watched
with
a
cynical
sympathy
the
impertinence
of
a
that
walked
in
his
courtyard
he
made
friends
with
a
mouse
who
from
her
appearance
was
a
lady
and
came
and
ate
out
of
his
plate
the
cranes
that
flew
over
khartoum
in
their
thousands
and
with
their
curious
cry
put
him
in
mind
of
the
poems
of
schiller
which
few
ever
read
but
which
he
admired
highly
though
he
only
knew
them
in
translation
he
wrote
little
disquisitions
on
plutarch
and
purgatory
on
the
fear
of
death
and
on
the
sixteenth
chapter
of
the
koran
then
the
strutting
with
feather
on
end
and
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
on
his
neck
attracted
him
once
more
and
he
filled
several
pages
with
his
opinions
upon
the
immortality
of
animals
drifting
on
to
a
discussion
of
man
position
in
the
universe
and
the
infinite
knowledge
of
god
it
was
all
clear
to
him
and
yet
a
contradiction
is
life
i
hate
her
majesty
government
for
their
leaving
the
sudan
after
having
caused
all
its
troubles
yet
i
believe
our
lord
rules
heaven
and
earth
so
i
ought
to
hate
him
which
i
sincerely
do
not
one
painful
thought
obsessed
him
he
believed
that
the
two
egyptian
officers
who
had
been
put
to
death
after
the
defeat
in
march
had
been
unjustly
executed
he
had
given
way
to
influences
the
two
pashas
had
been
murdered
again
and
again
he
referred
to
the
incident
with
a
haunting
remorse
the
times
perhaps
would
consider
that
he
had
been
justified
but
what
did
that
matter
the
times
saw
this
in
print
it
would
say
why
then
did
you
act
as
you
did
to
which
i
fear
i
have
no
answer
he
determined
to
make
what
reparation
he
could
and
to
send
the
families
of
the
unfortunate
pashas
each
on
a
similar
but
a
less
serious
occasion
he
put
the
same
principle
into
action
he
boxed
the
ears
of
a
careless
telegraph
clerk
then
as
my
conscience
pricked
me
i
gave
him
he
said
he
did
not
mind
if
i
killed
him
i
was
his
father
a
youth
of
twenty
his
temper
indeed
was
growing
more
and
more
uncertain
as
he
himself
was
well
aware
he
observed
with
horror
that
men
trembled
when
they
came
into
his
presence
that
their
hands
shook
so
that
they
could
not
hold
a
match
to
a
cigarette
he
trusted
no
one
looking
into
the
faces
of
those
who
surrounded
him
he
saw
only
the
signs
of
treachery
and
dislike
of
the
inhabitants
of
khartoum
he
calculated
that
were
willing
were
perhaps
anxious
to
become
the
subjects
of
the
mahdi
people
are
not
worth
any
great
sacrifice
he
bitterly
observed
the
egyptian
officials
were
utterly
incompetent
the
soldiers
were
cowards
all
his
admiration
was
reserved
for
his
enemies
the
meanest
of
the
mahdi
followers
was
he
realised
determined
warrior
who
could
undergo
thirst
and
privation
who
no
more
cared
for
pain
or
death
than
if
he
were
stone
those
were
the
men
whom
if
the
choice
had
lain
with
him
he
would
have
wished
to
command
and
yet
strangely
enough
he
persistently
underrated
the
strength
of
the
forces
against
him
a
handful
of
englishmen
a
handful
of
turks
would
he
believed
be
enough
to
defeat
the
mahdi
hosts
and
destroy
his
dominion
he
knew
very
little
arabic
and
he
depended
for
his
information
upon
a
few
ignorant
subordinates
the
mahdi
himself
he
viewed
with
ambiguous
feelings
he
jibed
at
him
as
a
vulgar
impostor
but
it
is
easy
to
perceive
under
his
scornful
jocularities
the
traces
of
an
uneasy
respect
he
spent
long
hours
upon
the
palace
roof
gazing
northwards
but
the
veil
of
mystery
and
silence
was
unbroken
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
major
kitchener
the
officer
in
command
of
the
egyptian
intelligence
service
hardly
any
messengers
ever
reached
khartoum
and
when
they
did
the
information
they
brought
was
tormentingly
scanty
major
kitchener
did
not
escape
the
attentions
of
gordon
pen
when
news
came
at
last
it
was
terrible
colonel
stewart
and
his
companions
had
been
killed
the
abbas
after
having
passed
uninjured
through
the
part
of
the
river
commanded
by
the
mahdi
troops
had
struck
upon
a
rock
colonel
stewart
had
disembarked
in
safety
and
while
he
was
waiting
for
camels
to
convey
the
detachment
across
the
desert
into
egypt
had
accepted
the
hospitality
of
a
local
sheikh
hardly
had
the
europeans
entered
the
sheikh
hut
when
they
were
set
upon
and
murdered
their
native
followers
shared
their
fate
the
treacherous
sheikh
was
an
adherent
of
the
mahdi
and
to
the
mahdi
all
colonel
stewart
papers
filled
with
information
as
to
the
condition
of
khartoum
were
immediately
sent
when
the
first
rumours
of
the
disaster
reached
gordon
he
pictured
in
a
flash
of
intuition
the
actual
details
of
the
catastrophe
feel
somehow
convinced
he
wrote
they
were
captured
by
treachery
stewart
was
not
a
bit
suspicious
i
am
made
up
of
it
i
can
see
in
imagination
the
whole
scene
the
sheikh
inviting
them
to
land
then
a
rush
of
wild
arabs
and
all
is
over
is
very
sad
he
added
being
ordained
we
must
not
murmur
and
yet
he
believed
that
the
true
responsibility
lay
with
him
it
was
the
punishment
of
his
own
sins
look
on
it
was
his
unexpected
conclusion
being
a
nemesis
on
the
death
of
the
two
pashas
the
workings
of
his
conscience
did
indeed
take
on
surprising
shapes
of
the
three
of
darfur
and
equatoria
emin
pasha
had
disappeared
lupton
bey
had
died
and
slatin
pasha
was
held
in
captivity
by
the
mahdi
by
birth
an
austrian
and
a
catholic
slatin
in
the
last
desperate
stages
of
his
resistance
had
adopted
the
expedient
of
announcing
his
conversion
to
mohammedanism
in
order
to
win
the
confidence
of
his
native
troops
on
his
capture
the
fact
of
his
conversion
procured
him
some
degree
of
consideration
and
though
he
occasionally
suffered
from
the
caprices
of
his
masters
he
had
so
far
escaped
the
terrible
punishment
which
had
been
meted
out
to
some
other
of
the
mahdi
european
prisoners
that
of
close
confinement
in
the
common
gaol
he
was
now
kept
prisoner
in
one
of
the
camps
in
the
neighbourhood
of
khartoum
he
managed
to
smuggle
through
a
letter
to
gordon
asking
for
assistance
in
case
he
could
make
his
escape
to
this
letter
gordon
did
not
reply
slatin
wrote
again
and
again
his
piteous
appeals
couched
in
no
less
piteous
french
made
no
effect
upon
the
heart
of
the
he
wrote
envoye

the
unfortunate
slatin
understood
well
enough
the
cause
of
silence
it
was
in
vain
that
he
explained
the
motives
of
his
conversion
in
vain
that
he
pointed
out
that
it
had
been
made
easier
for
him
since
he
had
unhappily
not
received
a
strict
religious
education
at
home
gordon
was
adamant
slatin
had
his
lord
and
that
was
enough
his
communications
with
khartoum
were
discovered
and
he
was
put
in
chains
when
gordon
heard
of
it
he
noted
the
fact
grimly
in
his
diary
without
a
comment
a
more
ghastly
fate
awaited
another
european
who
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
mahdi
clavier
pain
a
french
adventurer
who
had
taken
part
in
the
commune
and
who
was
now
wandering
for
reasons
which
have
never
been
discovered
in
the
wastes
of
the
sudan
was
seized
by
the
arabs
made
prisoner
and
hurried
from
camp
to
camp
he
was
attacked
by
fever
but
mercy
was
not
among
the
virtues
of
the
savage
soldiers
who
held
him
in
their
power
hoisted
upon
the
back
of
a
camel
he
was
being
carried
across
the
desert
when
overcome
by
weakness
he
lost
his
hold
and
fell
to
the
ground
time
or
trouble
were
not
to
be
wasted
upon
an
infidel
orders
were
given
that
he
should
be
immediately
buried
the
orders
were
carried
out
and
in
a
few
moments
the
cavalcade
had
left
the
little
hillock
far
behind
but
some
of
those
who
were
present
believed
that
olivier
pain
had
been
still
breathing
when
his
body
was
covered
with
the
sand
gordon
on
hearing
that
a
frenchman
had
been
captured
by
the
mahdi
became
extremely
interested
the
idea
occurred
to
him
that
this
mysterious
individual
was
none
other
than
ernest
renan
he
wrote
in
his
last
publication
leave
of
the
world
and
is
said
to
have
gone
into
africa
not
to
reappear
again
he
had
met
renan
at
the
rooms
of
the
royal
geographical
society
had
noticed
that
he
looked
bored
the
result
no
doubt
of
too
much
admiration
and
had
felt
an
instinct
that
he
would
meet
him
again
the
instinct
now
seemed
to
be
justified
there
could
hardly
be
any
doubt
that
it
was
renan
who
else
could
it
be
he
comes
to
the
lines
he
decided
it
is
renan
i
shall
go
and
see
him
for
whatever
one
may
think
of
his
unbelief
in
our
lord
he
certainly
dared
to
say
what
he
thought
and
he
has
not
changed
his
creed
to
save
his
life
that
the
mellifluous
author
of
the
vie
de
jesus
should
have
determined
to
end
his
days
in
the
depths
of
africa
and
have
come
in
accordance
with
an
intuition
to
renew
his
acquaintance
with
general
gordon
in
the
lines
of
khartoum
would
indeed
have
been
a
strange
occurrence
but
who
shall
limit
the
strangeness
of
the
possibilities
that
lie
in
wait
for
the
sons
of
men
at
that
very
moment
in
the
corner
of
the
sudan
another
frenchman
of
a
peculiar
eminence
was
fulfilling
a
destiny
more
extraordinary
than
the
wildest
romance
in
the
town
of
harrar
near
the
red
sea
arthur
rimbaud
surveyed
with
splenetic
impatience
the
tragedy
of
khartoum
justement
les
anglais
he
wrote
leur

so
wrote
the
amazing
poet
of
the
saison
amid
those
futile
turmoils
of
petty
commerce
in
which
with
an
inexplicable
deliberation
he
had
forgotten
the
enchantments
of
an
unparalleled
adolescence
forgotten
the
fogs
of
london
and
the
streets
of
brussels
forgotten
paris
forgotten
the
subtleties
and
the
frenzies
of
inspiration
forgotten
the
agonised
embraces
of
verlaine
when
the
contents
of
colonel
stewart
papers
had
been
interpreted
to
the
mahdi
he
realised
the
serious
condition
of
khartoum
and
decided
that
the
time
had
come
to
press
the
siege
to
a
final
conclusion
at
the
end
of
october
he
himself
at
the
head
of
a
fresh
army
appeared
outside
the
town
from
that
moment
the
investment
assumed
a
more
and
more
menacing
character
the
lack
of
provisions
now
for
the
first
time
began
to
make
itself
felt
november
the
date
fixed
by
gordon
as
the
last
possible
moment
of
his
resistance
came
and
went
the
expeditionary
force
had
made
no
sign
the
fortunate
discovery
of
a
large
store
of
grain
concealed
by
some
merchants
for
purposes
of
speculation
once
more
postponed
the
catastrophe
but
the
attacking
army
grew
daily
more
active
the
skirmishes
around
the
lines
and
on
the
river
more
damaging
to
the
besieged
and
the
mahdi
guns
began
an
intermittent
bombardment
of
the
palace
by
december
it
was
calculated
that
there
was
not
fifteen
days
food
in
the
town
i
am
worn
to
a
shadow
with
the
food
question
gordon
wrote
is
one
continuous
demand
at
the
same
time
he
received
the
ominous
news
that
five
of
his
soldiers
had
deserted
to
the
mahdi
his
predicament
was
terrible
but
he
calculated
from
a
few
dubious
messages
that
had
reached
him
that
the
relieving
force
could
not
be
very
far
away
accordingly
on
the
he
decided
to
send
down
one
of
his
four
remaining
steamers
the
bordeen
to
meet
it
at
metemmah
in
order
to
deliver
to
the
officer
in
command
the
latest
information
as
to
the
condition
of
the
town
the
bordeen
carried
down
the
last
portion
of
the
journals
and
gordon
final
messages
to
his
friends
owing
to
a
misunderstanding
he
believed
that
sir
evelyn
baring
was
accompanying
the
expedition
from
egypt
and
some
of
his
latest
and
most
successful
satirical
fancies
played
around
the
vision
of
the
distressed
perched
for
days
upon
the
painful
eminence
of
a
camel
hump
was
a
slight
laugh
when
khartoum
heard
baring
was
bumping
his
way
up
here
a
regular
nemesis
but
when
sir
evelyn
baring
actually
arrived
in
whatever
condition
what
would
happen
gordon
lost
himself
in
the
multitude
of
his
speculations
his
own
object
he
declared
was
course
to
make
tracks
then
in
one
of
his
strange
premonitory
rhapsodies
he
threw
out
half
in
jest
and
half
in
earnest
that
the
best
solution
of
all
the
difficulties
of
the
future
would
be
the
appointment
of
major
kitchener
as
of
the
sudan
the
journal
ended
upon
a
note
of
menace
and
disdain
mark
this
if
the
expeditionary
force
and
i
ask
for
no
more
than
men
does
not
come
in
ten
days
the
town
may
fall
and
i
have
done
my
best
for
the
honour
of
our
country
c
gordon
send
me
no
information
though
you
have
lots
of
money
to
his
sister
augusta
he
was
more
explicit
decline
to
agree
he
told
her
the
expedition
comes
for
my
relief
it
comes
for
the
relief
of
the
garrisons
which
i
failed
to
accomplish
i
expect
her
majesty
government
are
in
a
precious
rage
with
me
for
holding
out
and
forcing
their
hand
the
admission
is
significant
and
then
came
the
final
adieux
may
be
the
last
letter
you
will
receive
from
me
for
we
are
on
our
last
legs
owing
to
the
delay
of
the
expedition
however
god
rules
all
and
as
he
will
rule
to
his
glory
and
our
welfare
his
will
be
done
i
fear
owing
to
circumstances
that
my
affairs
are
pecuniarily
not
over
bright
your
affectionate
brother
gordon
i
am
quite
happy
thank
god
and
like
lawrence
i
have
tried
to
do
my
duty
the
delay
of
the
expedition
was
even
more
serious
than
gordon
had
supposed
lord
wolseley
had
made
the
most
elaborate
preparations
he
had
collected
together
a
picked
army
of
of
the
finest
british
troops
he
had
arranged
a
system
of
river
transports
with
infinite
care
for
it
was
his
intention
to
take
no
risks
he
would
advance
in
force
up
the
nile
he
had
determined
that
the
fate
of
gordon
should
not
depend
upon
the
dangerous
hazards
of
a
small
and
hasty
exploit
there
is
no
doubt
in
view
of
the
opposition
which
the
relieving
force
actually
met
with
that
his
decision
was
a
wise
one
but
unfortunately
he
had
miscalculated
some
of
the
essential
elements
in
the
situation
when
his
preparations
were
at
last
complete
it
was
found
that
the
nile
had
sunk
so
low
that
the
flotillas
over
which
so
much
care
had
been
lavished
and
upon
which
depended
the
whole
success
of
the
campaign
would
be
unable
to
surmount
the
cataracts
at
the
same
time
it
was
by
then
the
middle
of
november
a
message
arrived
from
gordon
indicating
that
khartoum
was
in
serious
straits
it
was
clear
that
an
immediate
advance
was
necessary
the
river
route
was
out
of
the
question
a
swift
dash
across
the
desert
was
the
only
possible
expedient
after
all
but
no
preparations
for
land
transport
had
been
made
weeks
elapsed
before
a
sufficient
number
of
camels
could
be
collected
and
more
weeks
before
those
collected
were
trained
for
military
march
it
was
not
until
december
more
than
a
fortnight
after
the
last
entry
in
journal
that
sir
herbert
stewart
at
the
head
of
british
troops
was
able
to
leave
korti
on
his
march
towards
metemmah
miles
across
the
desert
his
advance
was
slow
and
it
was
tenaciously
disputed
by
the
mahdi
forces
there
was
a
desperate
engagement
on
january
at
the
wells
of
abu
klea
the
british
square
was
broken
for
a
moment
victory
hung
in
the
balance
but
the
arabs
were
repulsed
on
the
there
was
another
furiously
contested
fight
in
which
sir
herbert
stewart
was
killed
on
the
the
force
now
diminished
by
over
casualties
reached
metemmah
three
days
elapsed
in
reconnoitering
the
country
and
strengthening
the
position
of
the
camp
on
the
sir
charles
wilson
who
had
succeeded
to
the
command
embarked
on
the
bordeen
and
started
up
the
river
for
khartoum
on
the
following
evening
the
vessel
struck
on
a
rock
causing
a
further
delay
of
hours
it
was
not
until
january
that
sir
charles
wilson
arriving
under
a
heavy
fire
within
sight
of
khartoum
saw
that
the
egyptian
flag
was
not
flying
from
the
roof
of
the
palace
the
signs
of
ruin
and
destruction
on
every
hand
showed
clearly
enough
that
the
town
had
fallen
the
relief
expedition
was
two
days
late
the
details
of
what
passed
within
khartoum
during
the
last
weeks
of
the
siege
are
unknown
to
us
in
the
diary
of
bordeini
bey
a
levantine
merchant
we
catch
a
few
glimpses
of
the
final
stages
of
the
catastrophe
of
the
starving
populace
the
exhausted
garrison
the
fluctuations
of
despair
and
hope
the
dauntless
energy
of
the
still
he
worked
on
indefatigably
apportioning
provisions
collecting
ammunition
consulting
with
the
townspeople
encouraging
the
soldiers
his
hair
had
suddenly
turned
quite
white
late
one
evening
bordeini
bey
went
to
visit
him
in
the
palace
which
was
being
bombarded
by
the
mahdi
cannon
the
high
building
brilliantly
lighted
up
afforded
an
excellent
mark
as
the
shot
came
whistling
around
the
windows
the
merchant
suggested
that
it
would
be
advisable
to
stop
them
up
with
boxes
full
of
sand
upon
this
gordon
pasha
became
enraged
called
up
the
guard
and
gave
them
orders
to
shoot
me
if
i
moved
he
then
brought
a
very
large
lantern
which
would
hold
candles
he
and
i
then
put
the
candles
into
the
sockets
placed
the
lantern
on
the
table
in
front
of
the
window
lit
the
candles
and
then
we
sat
down
at
the
table
the
pasha
then
said
when
god
was
portioning
out
fear
to
all
the
people
in
the
world
at
last
it
came
to
my
turn
and
there
was
no
fear
left
to
give
me
go
tell
all
the
people
in
khartoum
that
gordon
fears
nothing
for
god
has
created
him
without
fear
on
january
omdurman
a
village
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
nile
which
had
hitherto
been
occupied
by
the
besieged
was
taken
by
the
arabs
the
town
was
now
closely
surrounded
and
every
chance
of
obtaining
fresh
supplies
was
cut
off
the
famine
became
terrible
dogs
donkeys
skins
gum
palm
fibre
were
devoured
by
the
desperate
inhabitants
the
soldiers
stood
on
the
fortifications
like
pieces
of
wood
hundreds
died
of
hunger
daily
their
corpses
filled
the
streets
and
the
survivors
had
not
the
strength
to
bury
the
dead
on
the
the
news
of
the
battle
of
abu
klea
reached
khartoum
the
english
were
coming
at
last
hope
rose
every
morning
the
assured
the
townspeople
that
one
day
more
would
see
the
end
of
their
sufferings
and
night
after
night
his
words
were
proved
untrue
on
the
a
rumour
spread
that
a
spy
had
arrived
with
letters
and
that
the
english
army
was
at
hand
a
merchant
found
a
piece
of
newspaper
lying
in
the
road
in
which
it
was
stated
that
the
strength
of
the
relieving
forces
was
men
for
a
moment
hope
flickered
up
again
only
to
relapse
once
more
the
rumour
the
letters
the
printed
paper
all
had
been
contrivances
of
gordon
to
inspire
the
garrison
with
the
courage
to
hold
out
on
the
it
was
obvious
that
the
arabs
were
preparing
an
attack
and
a
deputation
of
the
principal
inhabitants
waited
upon
the
but
he
refused
to
see
them
bordeini
bey
was
alone
admitted
to
his
presence
he
was
sitting
on
a
divan
and
as
bordeini
bey
came
into
the
room
he
snatched
the
fez
from
his
head
and
flung
it
from
him
more
can
i
say
he
exclaimed
in
a
voice
such
as
the
merchant
had
never
heard
before
people
will
no
longer
believe
me
i
have
told
them
over
and
over
again
that
help
would
be
here
but
it
has
never
come
and
now
they
must
see
i
tell
them
lies
i
can
do
nothing
more
go
and
collect
all
the
people
you
can
on
the
lines
and
make
a
good
stand
now
leave
me
to
smoke
these
cigarettes
bordeini
bey
knew
then
he
tells
us
that
gordon
pasha
was
in
despair
he
left
the
room
having
looked
upon
the
for
the
last
time
when
the
english
force
reached
metemmah
the
mahdi
who
had
originally
intended
to
reduce
khartoum
to
surrender
through
starvation
decided
to
attempt
its
capture
by
assault
the
receding
nile
had
left
one
portion
of
the
town
circumference
undefended
as
the
river
withdrew
the
rampart
had
crumbled
a
broad
expanse
of
mud
was
left
between
the
wall
and
the
water
and
the
soldiers
overcome
by
hunger
and
the
lassitude
of
hopelessness
had
trusted
to
the
morass
to
protect
them
and
neglected
to
repair
the
breach
early
on
the
morning
of
the
the
arabs
crossed
the
river
at
this
point
the
mud
partially
dried
up
presented
no
obstacle
nor
did
the
ruined
fortification
feebly
manned
by
some
troops
resistance
was
futile
and
it
was
scarcely
offered
the
mahdi
army
swarmed
into
khartoum
gordon
had
long
debated
with
himself
what
his
action
should
be
at
the
supreme
moment
shall
never
he
had
told
sir
evelyn
baring
taken
alive
he
had
had
gunpowder
put
into
the
cellars
of
the
palace
so
that
the
whole
building
might
at
a
moment
notice
be
blown
into
the
air
but
then
misgivings
had
come
upon
him
was
it
not
his
duty
maintain
the
faith
and
if
necessary
to
suffer
for
it
to
remain
a
tortured
and
humiliated
witness
of
his
lord
in
the
mahdi
chains
the
blowing
up
of
the
palace
would
have
he
thought
or
less
the
taint
of
suicide
would
be
in
a
way
taking
things
out
of
god
hands
he
remained
undecided
and
meanwhile
to
be
ready
for
every
contingency
he
kept
one
of
his
little
armoured
vessels
close
at
hand
on
the
river
with
steam
up
day
and
night
to
transport
him
if
so
he
should
decide
southward
through
the
enemy
to
the
recesses
of
equatoria
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
arabs
the
complete
collapse
of
the
defence
saved
him
the
necessity
of
making
up
his
mind
he
had
been
on
the
roof
in
his
when
the
attack
began
and
he
had
only
time
to
hurry
to
his
bedroom
to
slip
on
a
white
uniform
and
to
seize
up
a
sword
and
a
revolver
before
the
foremost
of
the
assailants
were
in
the
palace
the
crowd
was
led
by
four
of
the
fiercest
of
the
mahdi
followers
tall
and
swarthy
dervishes
splendid
in
their
jibbehs
their
great
swords
drawn
from
their
scabbards
of
brass
and
velvet
their
spears
flourishing
above
their
heads
gordon
met
them
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
for
a
moment
there
was
a
deathly
pause
while
he
stood
in
silence
surveying
his
antagonists
then
it
is
said
that
taha
shahin
the
dongolawi
cried
in
a
loud
voice
oun
el
yom
yomek
o
cursed
one
your
time
is
come
and
plunged
his
spear
into
the
englishman
body
his
only
reply
was
a
gesture
of
contempt
another
spear
transfixed
him
he
fell
and
the
swords
of
the
three
other
dervishes
instantly
hacked
him
to
death
thus
if
we
are
to
believe
the
official
chroniclers
in
the
dignity
of
unresisting
disdain
general
gordon
met
his
end
but
it
is
only
fitting
that
the
last
moments
of
one
whose
whole
life
was
passed
in
contradiction
should
be
involved
in
mystery
and
doubt
other
witnesses
told
a
very
different
story
the
man
whom
they
saw
die
was
not
a
saint
but
a
warrior
with
intrepidity
with
skill
with
desperation
he
flew
at
his
enemies
when
his
pistol
was
exhausted
he
fought
on
with
his
sword
he
forced
his
way
almost
to
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
and
among
a
heap
of
corpses
only
succumbed
at
length
to
the
sheer
weight
of
the
multitudes
against
him
that
morning
while
slatin
pasha
was
sitting
in
his
chains
in
the
camp
at
omdurman
he
saw
a
group
of
arabs
approaching
one
of
whom
was
carrying
something
wrapped
up
in
a
cloth
as
the
group
passed
him
they
stopped
for
a
moment
and
railed
at
him
in
savage
mockery
then
the
cloth
was
lifted
and
he
saw
before
him
gordon
head
the
trophy
was
taken
to
the
mahdi
at
last
the
two
fanatics
had
indeed
met
face
to
face
the
mahdi
ordered
the
head
to
be
fixed
between
the
branches
of
a
tree
in
the
public
highway
and
all
who
passed
threw
stones
at
it
the
hawks
of
the
desert
swept
and
circled
about
it
those
very
hawks
which
the
blue
eyes
had
so
often
watched
the
news
of
the
catastrophe
reached
england
and
a
great
outcry
arose
the
public
grief
vied
with
the
public
indignation
the
queen
in
a
letter
to
miss
gordon
immediately
gave
vent
both
to
her
own
sentiments
and
those
of
the
nation
shall
i
write
to
you
she
exclaimed
how
shall
i
attempt
to
express
what
i
feel
to
think
of
your
dear
noble
heroic
brother
who
served
his
country
and
his
queen
so
truly
so
heroically
with
a
so
edifying
to
the
world
not
having
been
rescued
that
the
promises
of
support
were
not
fulfilled
which
i
so
frequently
and
constantly
pressed
on
those
who
asked
him
to
go
is
to
me
grief
inexpressible
indeed
it
has
made
me
ill
would
you
express
to
your
other
sisters
and
your
elder
brother
my
true
sympathy
and
what
i
do
so
keenly
feel
the
stain
left
upon
england
for
your
dear
brother
cruel
though
heroic
fate
in
reply
miss
gordon
presented
the
queen
with
her
brother
bible
which
was
placed
in
one
of
the
corridors
at
windsor
open
on
a
white
satin
cushion
and
enclosed
in
a
crystal
case
in
the
meanwhile
gordon
was
acclaimed
in
every
newspaper
as
a
national
martyr
state
services
were
held
in
his
honour
at
westminster
and
st
paul
was
voted
to
his
family
and
a
great
sum
of
money
was
raised
by
subscription
to
endow
a
charity
in
his
memory
wrath
and
execration
fell
in
particular
upon
the
head
of
gladstone
he
was
little
better
than
a
murderer
he
was
a
traitor
he
was
a
heartless
villain
who
had
been
seen
at
the
play
on
the
very
night
when
gordon
death
was
announced
the
storm
passed
but
gladstone
had
soon
to
cope
with
a
still
more
serious
agitation
the
cry
was
raised
on
every
side
that
the
national
honour
would
be
irreparably
tarnished
if
the
mahdi
were
left
in
the
peaceful
possession
of
khartoum
and
that
the
expeditionary
force
should
be
at
once
employed
to
chastise
the
false
prophet
and
to
conquer
the
sudan
but
it
was
in
vain
that
the
imperialists
clamoured
in
vain
that
lord
wolseley
wrote
several
dispatches
proving
over
and
over
again
that
to
leave
the
mahdi
unconquered
must
involve
the
ruin
of
egypt
in
vain
that
lord
hartington
at
last
discovered
that
he
had
come
to
the
same
conclusion
the
old
man
stood
firm
just
then
a
crisis
with
russia
on
the
afghan
frontier
supervened
and
gladstone
pointing
out
that
every
available
soldier
might
be
wanted
at
any
moment
for
a
european
war
withdrew
lord
wolseley
and
his
army
from
egypt
the
russian
crisis
disappeared
the
mahdi
remained
supreme
lord
of
the
sudan
and
yet
it
was
not
with
the
mahdi
that
the
future
lay
before
six
months
were
out
in
the
plenitude
of
his
power
he
died
and
the
khalifa
abdullahi
reigned
in
his
stead
the
future
lay
with
major
kitchener
and
his
guns
thirteen
years
later
the
mahdi
empire
was
abolished
forever
in
the
gigantic
hecatomb
of
omdurman
after
which
it
was
thought
proper
that
a
religious
ceremony
in
honour
of
general
gordon
should
be
held
at
the
palace
at
khartoum
the
service
was
conducted
by
four
chaplains
of
the
catholic
anglican
presbyterian
and
methodist
persuasions
and
concluded
with
a
performance
of
with
me
the
general
favourite
hymn
by
a
select
company
of
sudanese
buglers
every
one
agreed
that
general
gordon
had
been
avenged
at
last
who
could
doubt
it
general
gordon
himself
possibly
fluttering
in
some
remote
nirvana
the
pages
of
a
phantasmal
bible
might
have
ventured
on
a
satirical
remark
but
general
gordon
had
always
been
a
contradictious
person
even
a
little
off
his
head
perhaps
though
a
hero
and
besides
he
was
no
longer
there
to
contradict
at
any
rate
it
had
all
ended
very
happily
in
a
glorious
slaughter
of
arabs

vast
addition
to
the
british
