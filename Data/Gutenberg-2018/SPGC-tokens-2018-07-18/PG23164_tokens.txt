is
a
modern
tale
of
an
sorcerer
and
an
sorcerer
apprentice
a
tale
of
the
creature
from
cleveland
depths
by
fritz
leiber
illustrated
by
wood
come
on
gussy
fay
prodded
quietly
quit
stalking
around
like
a
neurotic
bear
and
suggest
something
for
my
invention
team
to
work
on
i
enjoy
visiting
you
and
daisy
but
i
ca
stay
aboveground
all
night
if
being
outside
the
shelters
makes
you
nervous
do
come
around
any
more
gusterson
told
him
continuing
to
stalk
why
does
your
invention
team
think
of
something
to
invent
why
do
you
hah
in
the
hah
lay
triumphant
condemnation
of
a
whole
way
of
life
we
do
fay
responded
imperturbably
but
a
fresh
viewpoint
sometimes
helps
i
say
it
does
fay
you
burglar
i
bet
you
got
twenty
people
like
myself
you
milk
for
free
ideas
first
you
irritate
their
bark
and
then
you
make
the
rounds
every
so
often
to
draw
off
the
latex
or
the
maple
gloop
fay
smiled
it
ought
to
please
you
that
society
still
has
a
use
for
you
outre
types
it
takes
something
to
make
a
junior
executive
stay
aboveground
after
dark
when
the
missiles
are
on
the
prowl
society
ca
have
much
use
for
us
or
it
pay
us
something
gusterson
sourly
asserted
staring
blankly
at
the
tankless
tv
and
kicking
it
lightly
as
he
passed
on
no
you
wrong
about
that
gussy
money
not
the
key
goad
with
you
i
got
that
straight
from
our
motivations
chief
did
he
tell
you
what
we
should
use
instead
to
pay
the
grocer
a
deep
inner
sense
of
achievement
maybe
fay
why
should
i
do
any
free
thinking
for
micro
systems
i
tell
you
why
gussy
simply
because
you
get
a
kick
out
of
insulting
us
with
sardonic
ideas
if
we
take
one
of
them
seriously
you
think
we
degrading
ourselves
and
that
pleases
you
even
more
like
making
someone
laugh
at
a
lousy
pun
gusterson
held
still
in
his
roaming
and
grinned
that
the
reason
huh
i
suppose
my
suggestions
would
have
to
be
something
in
the
line
of
computers
where
one
sinister
molecule
does
the
work
of
three
big
bumbling
brain
cells
not
necessarily
micro
systems
is
branching
out
wheel
as
free
as
a
rogue
star
but
i
pass
along
to
promotion
your
one
brain
cell
sparkler
it
a
slight
exaggeration
but
it
catchy
i
have
my
kids
watch
your
ads
to
see
if
you
use
it
and
then
sue
the
whole
underworld
gusterson
frowned
as
he
resumed
his
stalking
he
stared
puzzledly
at
the
antique
tv
how
about
inventing
a
plutonium
termite
he
said
suddenly
it
would
get
rid
of
those
stockpiles
that
are
worrying
you
moles
to
death
fay
grimaced
noncommittally
and
cocked
his
head
well
then
how
about
a
beauty
mask
how
about
that
hey
i
mean
one
to
repair
a
woman
complexion
but
one
she
wear
all
the
time
that
make
her
look
like
a
sexpot
that
end
worries
hey
that
for
me
daisy
called
from
the
kitchen
i
make
gusterson
suffer
i
make
him
crawl
around
on
his
hands
and
knees
begging
my
immature
favors
illustration
no
you
wo
gusterson
called
back
you
having
a
face
like
that
would
scare
the
kids
better
cancel
that
one
fay
half
the
adult
race
looking
like
vina
vidarsson
is
too
awful
a
thought
yah
you
just
scared
of
making
a
million
dollars
daisy
jeered
i
sure
am
gusterson
said
solemnly
scanning
the
fuzzy
floor
from
one
murky
glass
wall
to
the
other
hesitating
at
the
tv
how
about
something
homey
now
like
a
flock
of
little
prickly
cylinders
that
roll
around
the
floor
collecting
lint
and
flub
they
work
by
electricity
or
at
a
pinch
cats
could
bat
around
every
so
often
they
be
automatically
herded
together
and
the
lint
cleaned
off
the
bristles
no
good
fay
said
there
no
lint
underground
and
cats
are
and
the
aboveground
market
does
amount
to
more
moneywise
than
the
state
of
southern
illinois
keep
it
grander
gussy
and
more
impractical
you
ca
sell
people
merely
useful
ideas
from
his
hassock
in
the
center
of
the
room
he
looked
uneasily
around
say
did
that
violet
tone
in
the
glass
come
from
the
high
cleveland
hydrogen
bomb
or
is
it
just
age
and
ultraviolet
like
desert
glass
no
somebody
grandfather
liked
it
that
color
gusterson
informed
him
with
happy
bitterness
i
like
it
too
the
glass
i
mean
not
the
tint
people
who
live
in
glass
houses
can
see
the
stars
especially
when
there
a
streak
in
their
gussy
why
do
you
move
underground
fay
asked
his
voice
taking
on
a
missionary
note
it
a
lot
easier
living
in
one
room
believe
me
you
do
have
to
tramp
from
room
to
room
hunting
things
i
like
the
exercise
gusterson
said
stoutly
but
i
bet
daisy
prefer
it
underground
and
your
kids
would
have
to
explain
why
their
father
lives
like
a
red
indian
not
to
mention
the
safety
factor
and
insurance
savings
and
a
crypt
church
within
easy
slidewalk
distance
incidentally
we
see
the
stars
all
the
time
better
than
you
do
by
repeater
stars
by
repeater
gusterson
murmured
to
the
ceiling
pausing
for
god
to
comment
then
no
fay
even
if
i
could
afford
it
and
stand
it
such
a
harry
that
just
when
i
got
us
all
safely
stowed
at
the
n
minus
sublevel
the
soviets
would
discover
an
earthquake
bomb
that
struck
from
below
and
i
have
to
follow
everybody
back
to
the
treetops
how
about
bubble
homes
in
orbit
around
earth
micro
systems
could
subdivide
the
world
most
spacious
suburb
and
all
you
moles
could
go
ellipsing
space
is
as
safe
as
there
is
no
air
no
shock
waves
free
fall
the
ultimate
in
restfulness
great
health
benefits
commute
by
rocket
or
better
yet
stay
home
and
do
all
your
business
by
or
by
waldo
if
it
were
that
sort
of
thing
even
pet
your
girl
by
remote
control
she
in
her
bubble
you
in
yours
whizzing
through
vacuum
oh
he
was
glaring
at
the
blank
screen
of
the
tv
his
big
hands
clenching
and
unclenching
do
let
fay
give
you
apoplexy
he
not
worth
it
daisy
said
sticking
her
trim
head
in
from
the
kitchen
while
fay
inquired
anxiously
gussy
what
the
matter
nothing
you
worm
gusterson
roared
except
that
an
hour
ago
i
forgot
to
tune
in
on
the
only
tv
program
i
wanted
to
hear
this
year
scored
for
english
gaelic
and
brogue
oh
too
bad
fay
said
lightly
i
did
know
they
were
releasing
it
on
flat
tv
too
well
they
were
some
things
are
too
damn
big
to
keep
completely
underground
and
i
had
to
forget
i
always
doing
it
i
miss
everything
look
here
you
rat
he
blatted
suddenly
at
fay
shaking
his
finger
under
the
latter
chin
i
tell
you
what
you
can
have
that
ignorant
team
of
yours
invent
they
can
fix
me
up
a
mechanical
secretary
that
i
can
feed
orders
into
and
that
remind
me
when
the
exact
moment
comes
to
listen
to
tv
or
phone
somebody
or
mail
in
a
story
or
write
a
letter
or
pick
up
a
magazine
or
look
at
an
eclipse
or
a
new
orbiting
station
or
fetch
the
kids
from
school
or
buy
daisy
a
bunch
of
flowers
or
whatever
it
is
it
got
to
be
something
always
with
me
not
something
i
have
to
go
and
consult
or
that
i
can
get
sick
of
and
put
down
somewhere
and
it
got
to
remind
me
forcibly
enough
so
that
i
take
notice
and
do
just
shrug
it
aside
like
i
sometimes
do
even
when
daisy
reminds
me
of
things
that
what
your
stupid
team
can
invent
for
me
if
they
do
a
good
job
i
pay
as
much
as
fifty
dollars
that
does
sound
like
anything
so
very
original
to
me
fay
commented
coolly
leaning
back
from
the
wagging
finger
i
think
all
senior
executives
have
something
of
that
sort
at
least
their
secretary
keeps
some
kind
of
file
i
not
looking
for
something
with
spiked
falsies
and
nylons
up
to
the
neck
interjected
gusterson
whose
ideas
about
secretaries
were
a
trifle
lurid
i
just
want
a
mech
reminder
that
all
well
i
keep
the
idea
in
mind
fay
assured
him
along
with
the
bubble
homes
and
beauty
masks
if
we
ever
develop
anything
along
those
lines
i
let
you
know
if
it
a
beauty
mask
i
bring
daisy
a
pilot
model
to
use
to
scare
strange
kids
he
put
his
watch
to
his
ear
good
lord
i
going
to
have
to
cut
to
make
it
underground
before
the
main
doors
close
just
ten
minutes
to
second
curfew
gus
daze
two
minutes
later
living
room
lights
out
they
watched
foreshortened
antlike
figure
scurrying
across
the
balding
park
toward
the
nearest
escalator
gusterson
said
weird
to
think
of
that
big
bright
glamor
basement
stretching
around
everywhere
underneath
did
you
remind
smitty
to
put
a
new
bulb
in
the
elevator
the
smiths
moved
out
this
morning
daisy
said
tonelessly
they
went
underneath
like
cockroaches
gusterson
said
cockroaches
leavin
a
apartment
building
next
the
ghosts
be
retreatin
to
the
shelters
anyhow
from
now
on
we
our
own
janitors
daisy
said
he
nodded
just
leaves
three
families
besides
us
loyal
to
this
glass
death
trap
not
countin
ghosts
he
sighed
then
you
like
to
move
below
daisy
he
asked
softly
putting
his
arm
lightly
across
her
shoulders
get
a
woozy
eyeful
of
the
bright
lights
and
all
for
a
change
be
a
rat
for
a
while
maybe
we
getting
too
old
to
be
bats
i
could
scrounge
me
a
company
job
and
have
a
thinking
closet
all
to
myself
and
two
secretaries
with
stainless
steel
breasts
life
be
easier
for
you
and
a
lot
cleaner
and
you
sleep
safer
that
true
she
answered
and
paused
she
ran
her
fingertip
slowly
across
the
murky
glass
its
violet
tint
barely
perceptible
against
a
cold
dim
light
across
the
park
but
somehow
she
said
snaking
her
arm
around
his
waist
i
do
think
i
sleep
happier
or
one
bit
excited
ii
three
weeks
later
fay
dropping
in
again
handed
to
daisy
the
larger
of
the
two
rather
small
packages
he
was
carrying
it
a
beauty
mask
he
told
her
complete
with
wig
eyelashes
and
wettable
velvet
lips
it
even
breathes
pinholed
elastiskin
with
a
static
but
micro
systems
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
thank
god
beauty
trix
put
it
on
the
market
ten
days
ago
and
it
already
started
a
craze
some
boys
are
wearing
them
too
and
the
police
are
yipping
at
trix
for
encouraging
transvestism
with
psychic
repercussions
did
i
hear
somewhere
that
trix
is
a
secret
subsidiary
of
micro
gusterson
demanded
rearing
up
from
his
ancient
electric
typewriter
no
you
not
stopping
me
writing
fay
it
the
gut
of
evening
if
i
do
any
more
i
wo
have
any
juice
to
start
with
tomorrow
i
got
another
of
my
insanity
thrillers
moving
a
real
in
this
one
not
only
all
the
characters
are
crazy
but
the
robot
psychiatrist
too
the
vending
machines
are
jumping
with
insanity
novels
fay
commented
odd
they
so
popular
gusterson
chortled
the
only
way
you
moles
will
accept
individuality
any
more
even
in
a
fictional
character
without
your
superegos
getting
seasick
is
for
them
to
be
crazy
hey
daisy
lem
me
see
that
beauty
mask
but
his
wife
backing
out
of
the
room
hugged
the
package
to
her
bosom
and
solemnly
shook
her
head
a
hell
of
a
thing
gusterson
complained
not
even
to
be
able
to
see
what
my
stolen
ideas
look
like
i
got
a
present
for
you
too
fay
said
something
you
might
think
of
as
a
royalty
on
all
the
inventions
someone
thought
of
a
little
ahead
of
you
fifty
dollars
by
your
own
evaluation
he
held
out
the
smaller
package
your
tickler
my
gusterson
demanded
suspiciously
your
tickler
the
mech
reminder
you
wanted
it
turns
out
that
the
file
a
secretary
keeps
to
remind
her
boss
to
do
certain
things
at
certain
times
is
called
a
tickler
file
so
we
named
this
a
tickler
here
gusterson
still
did
touch
the
package
you
mean
you
actually
put
your
invention
team
to
work
on
that
nonsense
well
what
do
you
think
do
be
scared
of
it
here
i
show
you
as
he
unwrapped
the
package
fay
said
it
has
been
decided
yet
whether
we
manufacture
it
commercially
if
we
do
i
put
through
a
voucher
for
you
for
consultation
or
something
like
that
sorry
no
royalty
possible
davidson
squad
had
started
to
work
up
the
identical
idea
three
years
ago
but
it
got
shelved
i
found
it
on
a
snoop
through
the
closets
there
looks
rich
it
on
the
scarred
black
tabletop
was
a
dully
gleaming
silvery
object
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
cupped
hand
with
fingers
merging
a
tiny
pellet
on
a
short
wire
led
off
from
it
on
the
back
was
a
punctured
area
suggesting
the
face
of
a
microphone
there
was
also
a
window
with
a
date
and
time
in
hours
and
minutes
showing
through
and
next
to
that
four
little
buttons
in
a
row
the
concave
underside
of
the
silvery
hand
was
smooth
except
for
a
central
area
where
what
looked
like
two
little
rollers
came
through
it
goes
on
your
shoulder
under
your
shirt
fay
explained
and
you
tuck
the
pellet
in
your
ear
we
might
work
up
bone
conduction
on
a
commercial
model
inside
is
an
recorder
holding
a
spool
that
runs
for
a
week
the
clock
lets
you
go
to
any
place
on
the
wire
and
record
a
message
the
buttons
give
you
variable
speed
in
going
there
so
you
do
waste
too
much
time
making
a
setting
there
a
knack
in
fingering
them
efficiently
but
it
easily
acquired
fay
picked
up
the
tickler
for
instance
suppose
there
a
tv
show
you
want
to
catch
tomorrow
night
at
hundred
he
touched
the
buttons
there
was
the
faintest
whirring
the
clock
face
blurred
briefly
three
times
before
showing
the
setting
he
mentioned
then
fay
spoke
into
the
punctured
area
turn
on
tv
channel
two
you
big
dummy
he
grinned
over
at
gusterson
when
you
got
all
your
instructions
to
yourself
loaded
in
you
synchronize
with
the
present
moment
and
let
her
roll
fit
it
on
your
shoulder
and
forget
it
oh
yes
and
it
literally
does
tickle
you
every
time
it
delivers
an
instruction
that
what
the
little
rollers
are
for
believe
me
you
ca
ignore
it
come
on
gussy
take
off
your
shirt
and
try
it
out
we
feed
in
some
instructions
for
the
next
ten
minutes
so
you
get
the
feel
of
how
it
works
i
do
want
to
gusterson
said
not
right
now
i
want
to
sniff
around
it
first
my
god
it
small
besides
everything
else
it
does
does
it
think
do
pretend
to
be
an
idiot
gussy
you
know
very
well
that
even
with
nothing
quite
this
small
can
possibly
have
enough
elements
to
do
any
thinking
gusterson
shrugged
i
do
know
about
that
i
think
bugs
think
fay
groaned
faintly
bugs
operate
by
instinct
gussy
he
said
a
patterned
routine
they
do
not
scan
situations
and
consequences
and
then
make
decisions
i
do
expect
bugs
to
make
decisions
gusterson
said
for
that
matter
i
do
like
people
who
go
around
alla
time
making
decisions
well
you
can
take
it
from
me
gussy
that
this
tickler
is
just
a
miniaturized
wire
recorder
and
clock
and
a
tickler
it
does
do
anything
else
not
yet
maybe
gusterson
said
darkly
not
this
model
fay
serious
about
bugs
thinking
or
if
they
do
exactly
think
they
feel
they
got
an
interior
drama
an
inner
glow
they
conscious
for
that
matter
fay
i
think
all
your
really
complex
electronic
computers
are
conscious
too
quit
kidding
gussy
who
kidding
you
are
computers
simply
are
alive
what
alive
a
word
i
think
computers
are
conscious
at
least
while
they
operating
they
got
that
inner
glow
of
awareness
they
sort
of
well
meditate
gussy
computers
have
got
any
circuits
for
meditating
they
not
programmed
for
mystical
lucubrations
they
just
got
circuits
for
solving
the
problems
they
on
okay
you
admit
they
got
circuits
like
a
man
has
i
say
if
they
got
the
equipment
for
being
conscious
conscious
what
has
wings
flies
including
stuffed
owls
and
gilt
eagles
and
dodoes
and
airplanes
maybe
under
some
circumstances
there
a
airplane
fay
gusterson
continued
wagging
his
wrists
for
emphasis
i
really
think
computers
are
conscious
they
just
do
have
any
way
of
telling
us
that
they
are
or
maybe
they
do
have
any
to
tell
us
like
the
little
scotch
boy
who
did
say
a
word
until
he
was
fifteen
and
was
supposed
to
be
deaf
and
dumb
why
did
he
say
a
word
because
he
never
had
anything
to
say
or
take
those
hindu
fakirs
fay
who
sit
still
and
do
say
a
word
for
thirty
years
or
until
their
fingernails
grow
to
the
next
village
if
hindu
fakirs
can
do
that
computers
can
looking
as
if
he
were
masticating
a
lemon
fay
asked
quietly
gussy
did
you
say
you
working
on
an
insanity
novel
gusterson
frowned
fiercely
now
you
kidding
he
accused
fay
the
dirty
kind
of
kidding
too
i
sorry
fay
said
with
light
contrition
well
now
you
sniffed
at
it
how
about
trying
on
tickler
he
picked
up
the
gleaming
blunted
crescent
and
jogged
it
temptingly
under
gusterson
chin
why
should
i
gusterson
asked
stepping
back
fay
i
up
to
my
ears
writing
a
book
the
last
thing
i
want
is
something
interrupting
me
to
make
me
listen
to
a
lot
of
junk
and
do
a
lot
of
useless
things
but
dammit
gussy
it
was
all
your
idea
in
the
first
place
fay
blatted
then
catching
himself
he
added
i
mean
you
were
one
of
the
first
people
to
think
of
this
particular
sort
of
instrument
maybe
so
but
i
done
some
more
thinking
since
then
voice
grew
a
trifle
solemn
worthwhile
thinkin
fay
when
a
man
forgets
to
do
something
it
because
he
really
want
to
do
it
or
because
he
all
roiled
up
down
in
his
unconscious
he
ought
to
take
it
as
a
danger
signal
and
investigate
the
roiling
not
hire
himself
a
human
or
mech
reminder
bushwa
fay
retorted
in
that
case
you
should
write
memorandums
or
even
take
notes
maybe
i
should
gusterson
agreed
lamely
i
have
to
think
that
over
too
ha
fay
jeered
no
i
tell
you
what
your
trouble
is
gussy
you
simply
scared
of
this
contraption
you
loaded
your
skull
with
nonsense
about
machines
sprouting
minds
and
taking
over
the
world
until
you
even
scared
of
a
simple
miniaturized
and
clocked
recorder
he
thrust
it
out
maybe
i
am
gusterson
admitted
controlling
a
flinch
honestly
fay
that
thing
got
a
gleam
in
its
eye
as
if
it
had
ideas
of
its
own
nasty
ideas
gussy
you
nut
it
has
an
eye
not
now
no
but
it
got
the
gleam
the
eye
may
come
it
the
cheshire
cat
in
reverse
if
you
step
over
here
and
look
at
yourself
holding
it
you
could
see
what
i
mean
but
i
do
think
computers
minds
fay
i
just
think
they
minds
because
got
the
mind
elements
ho
ho
fay
mocked
everything
that
has
a
material
side
has
a
mental
side
he
chanted
everything
that
a
body
is
also
a
spirit
gussy
that
dubious
old
metaphysical
dualism
went
out
centuries
ago
maybe
so
gusterson
said
but
we
still
have
anything
but
that
dubious
dualism
to
explain
the
human
mind
have
we
it
a
jelly
of
nerve
cells
and
it
a
vision
of
the
cosmos
if
that
is
dualism
what
is
i
give
up
gussy
are
you
going
to
try
out
this
tickler
no
but
dammit
gussy
we
made
it
just
for
you
practically
sorry
but
i
not
coming
near
the
thing
zen
come
near
me
a
husky
voice
intoned
behind
them
tonight
i
vant
a
man
standing
in
the
door
was
something
slim
in
a
short
silver
sheath
it
had
golden
bangs
and
the
haughtiest
face
in
the
world
it
slunk
toward
them
my
god
vina
vidarsson
gusterson
yelled
daisy
that
terrific
fay
applauded
going
up
to
her
she
bumped
him
aside
with
a
swing
of
her
hips
continuing
to
advance
not
you
ratty
she
said
throatily
i
vant
a
real
man
fay
i
suggested
vina
vidarsson
face
for
the
beauty
mask
gusterson
said
walking
around
his
wife
and
shaking
a
finger
tell
me
trix
just
happened
to
think
of
that
too
what
else
could
they
think
of
fay
laughed
this
season
sex
means
vv
and
nobody
else
an
odd
little
grin
flicked
his
lips
a
tic
traveled
up
his
face
and
his
body
twitched
slightly
say
folks
going
to
have
to
be
leaving
it
exactly
fifteen
minutes
to
second
curfew
last
time
i
had
to
run
and
i
got
heartburn
when
you
people
going
to
move
downstairs
i
leave
tickler
gussy
play
around
with
it
and
get
used
to
it
now
hey
fay
gusterson
called
curiously
have
you
developed
absolute
time
sense
fay
grinned
a
big
grin
from
the
doorway
almost
too
big
a
grin
for
so
small
a
man
i
did
need
to
he
said
softly
patting
his
right
shoulder
my
tickler
told
me
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
as
they
watched
him
strut
sedately
across
the
murky
park
gusterson
mused
so
the
little
devil
had
one
of
those
on
all
the
time
and
i
never
noticed
can
you
beat
that
something
drew
across
the
stars
a
short
bright
line
that
quickly
faded
what
that
gusterson
asked
gloomily
next
to
last
stage
of
wo
you
settle
for
an
shooting
star
daisy
asked
softly
the
wettable
velvet
lips
of
the
mask
made
even
her
natural
voice
sound
different
she
reached
a
hand
back
of
her
neck
to
pull
the
thing
off
hey
do
do
that
gusterson
protested
in
a
hurt
voice
not
for
a
while
anyway
hokay
she
said
harshly
turning
on
him
zen
down
on
your
knees
dog
iii
it
was
a
fortnight
and
gusterson
was
loping
down
the
home
stretch
on
his
insanity
novel
before
fay
dropped
in
again
this
time
promptly
at
high
noon
normally
fay
cringed
his
shoulders
a
trifle
and
was
inclined
to
slither
but
now
he
strode
aggressively
his
legs
scissoring
in
a
fast
low
goosestep
he
whipped
off
the
sunglasses
that
all
moles
wore
topside
by
day
and
began
to
pound
gusterson
on
the
back
while
calling
boisterously
how
are
you
gussy
old
boy
old
boy
daisy
came
in
from
the
kitchen
to
see
why
gusterson
was
choking
she
was
instantly
grabbed
and
violently
bussed
to
the
accompaniment
of
hiya
gorgeous
how
about
that
some
weekend
she
stared
at
fay
dazedly
rasping
the
back
of
her
hand
across
her
mouth
while
gusterson
yelled
quit
that
what
got
into
you
fay
have
they
transferred
you
out
of
r
d
to
company
morale
do
they
line
up
all
the
secretaries
at
roll
call
and
make
you
give
them
an
energizing
kiss
ha
would
you
like
to
know
fay
retorted
he
grinned
twitched
jumpingly
held
still
a
moment
then
hustled
over
to
the
far
wall
look
out
there
he
rapped
pointing
through
the
violet
glass
at
a
gap
between
the
two
nearest
old
skyscraper
apartments
in
thirty
seconds
you
see
them
test
the
new
needle
bomb
at
the
other
end
of
lake
erie
it
educational
he
began
to
count
off
seconds
vigorously
semaphoring
his
arm
two
three
gussy
i
put
through
a
voucher
for
two
yards
for
you
budgeting
squawked
but
i
pressured
daisy
squealed
yards
are
those
dollar
thousands
while
gusterson
was
asking
then
you
marketing
the
tickler
yes
yes
fay
replied
to
them
in
turn
nine
ten
again
he
grinned
and
twitched
time
for
noon
he
announced
staccato
pardon
the
hush
box
he
whipped
a
pancake
phone
from
under
his
coat
clapped
it
over
his
face
and
spoke
fiercely
but
inaudibly
into
it
continuing
to
semaphore
suddenly
he
thrust
the
phone
away
thirty
thar
she
blows
an
incandescent
streak
shot
up
the
sky
from
a
little
above
the
far
horizon
and
a
doubly
dazzling
point
of
light
appeared
just
above
the
top
of
it
with
the
effect
of
god
dotting
an
i
ha
that
skewer
espionage
satellites
like
swatting
flies
fay
proclaimed
as
the
portent
faded
bracing
gussy
where
your
tickler
i
got
a
new
spool
for
it
that
you
i
bet
gusterson
said
drily
daisy
you
gave
it
to
the
kids
and
they
got
to
fooling
with
it
and
broke
it
no
matter
fay
told
them
with
a
large
sidewise
sweep
of
his
hand
better
you
wait
for
the
new
model
it
a
improvement
so
i
gather
gusterson
said
eyeing
him
speculatively
does
it
automatically
inject
you
with
cocaine
a
fix
every
hour
on
the
second
joke
gussy
it
achieves
the
same
effect
without
using
any
dope
at
all
listen
a
tickler
reminds
you
of
your
duties
and
opportunities
your
chances
for
happiness
and
success
what
the
obvious
next
step
throw
it
out
the
window
by
the
way
how
do
you
do
that
when
underground
we
have
garbage
boosts
the
obvious
next
step
is
you
give
the
tickler
a
heart
it
not
only
tells
you
it
warmly
persuades
you
it
does
just
say
on
the
tv
channel
two
joyce
program
it
at
you
old
kid
race
for
the
tv
and
flip
that
two
switch
there
a
great
show
coming
through
the
pipes
this
second
plus
ten
you
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
yourself
grab
a
ticket
to
ecstasy
my
god
gusterson
gasped
are
those
the
kind
of
jolts
it
giving
you
now
do
you
get
it
gussy
you
never
load
your
tickler
except
when
you
feeling
buoyantly
enthusiastic
you
do
just
tell
yourself
what
to
do
hour
by
hour
next
week
you
sell
yourself
on
it
that
way
you
not
only
make
doubly
sure
you
obey
instructions
but
you
constantly
reinoculate
yourself
with
your
own
enthusiasm
i
ca
stand
myself
when
i
that
enthusiastic
gusterson
said
i
feel
ashamed
for
hours
afterwards
you
warped
all
this
lonely
what
more
gussy
think
how
still
more
persuasive
some
of
those
instructions
would
be
if
they
came
to
a
man
in
his
best
girl
most
bedroomy
voice
or
his
or
psycher
if
it
that
sort
of
thing
or
vina
vidarsson
by
the
way
daze
do
wear
that
beauty
mask
outside
it
a
grand
misdemeanor
ever
since
ten
thousand
rioted
through
wearing
them
and
vv
sueing
trix
no
chance
of
that
daisy
said
gusterson
got
excited
and
bit
off
the
nose
she
pinched
her
own
delicately
i
no
more
obey
my
enthusiastic
self
gusterson
was
brooding
than
i
obey
a
napoleon
drunk
on
his
own
brandy
or
a
francis
reinoculated
with
my
own
enthusiasm
i
die
just
like
from
warped
i
said
fay
dogmatized
stamping
around
gussy
having
the
instructions
persuasive
instead
of
neutral
turned
out
to
be
only
the
opening
wedge
the
next
step
was
so
obvious
but
i
saw
it
using
subliminal
verbal
stimuli
in
his
tickler
a
man
can
be
given
constant
supportive
euphoric
therapy
hours
a
day
and
it
makes
use
of
all
that
empty
wire
we
revived
the
ideas
of
a
pioneer
dynamic
psycher
named
coué
for
instance
right
now
my
tickler
is
saying
to
me
in
tones
too
soft
to
reach
my
conscious
mind
but
do
they
stab
into
the
unconscious
by
day
in
every
way
i
getting
sharper
and
sharper
it
alternates
that
with
and
gutsier
and
well
forget
that
coué
mostly
used
and
better
but
that
seems
too
general
and
every
hundredth
time
it
says
them
out
loud
and
the
tickler
gives
me
a
brush
just
a
faint
cootch
to
make
sure
keeping
in
touch
that
third
daisy
wondered
feeling
her
mouth
reminiscently
could
i
guess
gusterson
eyes
had
been
growing
wider
and
wider
fay
he
said
i
could
no
more
use
my
mind
for
anything
if
i
knew
all
that
was
going
on
in
my
inner
ear
than
if
i
were
being
brushed
down
with
brooms
by
three
witches
look
here
he
said
with
loud
authority
you
got
to
stop
all
this
it
crazy
fay
if
micro
junk
the
tickler
i
think
you
up
something
else
to
invent
something
real
good
your
inventing
days
are
over
fay
brilled
gleefully
i
mean
never
equal
your
masterpiece
how
about
gusterson
bellowed
an
guided
missile
the
physicists
have
got
antigravity
good
enough
to
float
and
fly
something
the
size
of
a
hand
grenade
i
can
smell
that
even
though
it
a
military
secret
well
how
about
keying
such
a
missile
to
a
man
or
brainwaves
maybe
or
his
unique
smell
so
it
can
spot
and
follow
him
around
then
target
in
on
him
without
harming
anyone
else
assassination
and
the
stinkingest
gets
it
or
you
could
simply
load
it
with
some
disgusting
goo
and
key
it
to
as
a
group
that
take
care
of
them
fay
does
it
give
you
a
rich
warm
kick
to
think
of
my
midget
missiles
buzzing
around
in
your
tunnels
seeking
out
like
a
swarm
of
angry
wasps
or
angelic
bumblebees
you
not
luring
me
down
any
side
trails
fay
said
laughingly
he
grinned
and
twitched
then
hurried
toward
the
opposite
wall
motioning
them
to
follow
outside
about
a
hundred
yards
beyond
the
purple
glass
rose
another
ancient
apartment
skyscraper
beyond
lake
erie
rippled
glintingly
another
gusterson
asked
fay
pointed
at
the
building
tomorrow
he
announced
a
modern
factory
devoted
solely
to
the
manufacture
of
ticklers
will
be
erected
on
that
site
you
mean
one
of
those
windowless
phallic
eyesores
gusterson
demanded
fay
you
people
are
even
consistent
you
got
all
your
homes
underground
why
not
your
factories
sh
not
enough
room
and
night
missiles
are
scarier
i
know
that
building
been
empty
for
a
year
daisy
said
uneasily
but
how
sh
watch
the
looming
building
seemed
to
blur
or
fuzz
for
a
moment
then
it
was
as
if
the
lake
bright
ripples
had
invaded
the
old
glass
a
hundred
yards
away
wavelets
chased
themselves
up
and
down
the
gleaming
walls
became
higher
higher
and
then
suddenly
the
glass
cracked
all
over
to
tiny
fragments
and
fell
away
to
be
followed
quickly
by
fragmented
concrete
and
plastic
and
plastic
piping
until
all
that
was
left
was
the
nude
steel
framework
vibrating
so
rapidly
as
to
be
almost
invisible
against
the
gleaming
lake
daisy
covered
her
ears
but
there
was
no
explosion
only
a
low
crash
as
the
fragments
hit
twenty
floors
below
and
dust
whooshed
out
sideways
spectacular
fay
summed
up
knew
you
enjoy
it
that
little
trick
was
first
conceived
by
the
great
tesla
during
his
last
fruity
years
research
discovered
it
in
his
biog
we
just
made
the
dream
come
true
a
tiny
resonance
device
you
could
carry
in
your
attunes
itself
to
the
natural
harmonic
of
a
structure
and
then
increases
amplitude
by
tiny
pushes
exactly
in
time
just
like
soldiers
marching
in
step
can
break
down
a
bridge
only
this
is
as
if
it
were
being
done
by
one
marching
ant
he
pointed
at
the
naked
framework
appearing
out
of
its
own
blur
and
said
we
be
able
to
hang
the
factory
on
that
if
not
we
whip
a
through
it
and
vaporize
it
no
question
the
is
the
neatest
sweetest
wrecking
device
going
you
can
expect
a
lot
more
of
this
sort
of
efficiency
now
that
mankind
has
the
tickler
to
enable
him
to
use
his
full
potential
what
the
matter
folks
daisy
was
staring
around
the
room
with
dumb
mistrust
her
hands
were
trembling
you
do
have
to
worry
fay
assured
her
with
an
understanding
laugh
this
building
safe
for
a
month
more
at
least
suddenly
he
grimaced
and
leaped
a
foot
in
the
air
he
raised
a
clawed
hand
to
scratch
his
shoulder
but
managed
to
check
the
movement
got
to
beat
it
folks
he
announced
tersely
my
tickler
gave
me
the
grand
cootch
do
go
yet
gusterson
called
rousing
himself
with
a
shudder
which
he
immediately
explained
i
just
had
the
illusion
that
if
i
shook
myself
all
my
flesh
and
guts
would
fall
off
my
shimmying
skeleton
brr
fay
before
you
and
micro
go
off
half
cocked
i
want
you
to
know
there
one
insuperable
objection
to
the
tickler
as
a
item
the
average
man
or
woman
wo
go
to
the
considerable
time
and
trouble
it
must
take
to
load
a
tickler
he
simply
has
got
the
compulsive
orderliness
and
willingness
to
plan
that
it
requires
we
thought
of
that
weeks
ago
fay
rapped
his
hand
on
the
door
every
tickler
spool
that
goes
to
market
is
patterned
like
wallpaper
with
one
of
five
designs
of
suitable
subliminal
supportive
euphoric
material
and
ittier
and
viriler
you
know
the
buyer
is
for
an
hour
his
personalized
daily
routine
laid
out
and
thereafter
templated
on
his
weekly
spool
he
strongly
urged
next
to
take
his
tickler
to
his
doctor
and
psycher
for
further
we
been
working
with
the
medical
profession
from
the
start
they
love
the
tickler
because
it
remind
people
to
take
their
medicine
on
the
dot
and
rest
and
eat
and
go
to
sleep
just
when
and
how
doc
says
this
is
a
big
operation
gussy
a
biiiiiiig
operation
daisy
hurried
to
the
wall
to
watch
him
cross
the
park
deep
down
she
was
a
wee
bit
worried
that
he
might
linger
to
attach
a
to
building
and
she
wanted
to
time
him
but
gusterson
settled
down
to
his
typewriter
and
began
to
bat
away
i
want
to
have
another
novel
started
he
explained
to
her
before
the
ant
marches
across
this
building
in
about
four
and
a
half
weeks
or
a
million
sharp
little
gutsy
guys
come
swarming
out
of
the
ground
and
heave
it
into
lake
erie
iv
early
next
morning
windowless
walls
began
to
crawl
up
the
stripped
skyscraper
between
them
and
the
lake
daisy
pulled
the
curtains
on
that
side
for
a
day
or
two
longer
their
thoughts
and
conversations
were
haunted
by
gusterson
vague
sardonic
visions
of
a
horde
of
moles
pouring
up
out
of
the
tunnels
to
tear
down
the
remaining
trees
tank
the
atmosphere
and
perhaps
somehow
dismantle
the
stars
at
least
on
this
side
of
the
world
but
then
they
both
settled
back
into
their
customary
routines
gusterson
typed
daisy
made
her
daily
shopping
trip
to
a
little
topside
daytime
store
and
started
painting
a
mural
on
the
floor
of
the
empty
apartment
next
theirs
but
one
we
ought
to
lasso
some
neighbors
she
suggested
once
i
need
somebody
to
hold
my
brushes
and
admire
how
about
you
making
a
trip
below
at
the
cocktail
hours
gusterson
and
picking
up
a
couple
of
girls
for
a
starter
flash
the
old
viriler
charm
cootch
them
up
a
bit
emphasize
the
delights
of
high
living
but
make
sure
compatible
roommates
you
could
pick
up
that
check
from
micro
at
the
same
time
you
an
immoral
wench
gusterson
said
absently
trying
to
dream
of
an
insanity
beyond
insanity
that
would
make
his
next
novel
a
real
if
that
your
vision
of
me
you
should
have
chewed
up
the
vv
mask
i
really
prefer
you
with
green
stripes
he
told
her
but
stripes
spots
or
you
better
than
those
cocktail
moles
actually
both
of
them
acutely
disliked
going
below
they
much
preferred
to
perch
in
their
eyrie
and
watch
the
people
of
cleveland
depths
as
they
privately
called
the
local
rush
up
out
of
the
shelters
at
dawn
to
work
in
the
concrete
fields
and
windowless
factories
make
their
daytime
jet
trips
and
freeway
jaunts
do
their
and
guerrilla
practice
and
then
go
scurrying
back
at
twilight
to
the
brightly
lit
vastly
exciting
claustrophobic
caves
fay
and
his
projects
began
once
more
to
seem
dreamlike
though
gusterson
did
run
across
a
cryptic
advertisement
for
ticklers
in
manchester
which
he
got
daily
by
facsimile
their
three
children
reported
similar
ads
of
no
interest
to
young
fry
on
the
tv
and
one
afternoon
they
came
home
with
the
startling
news
that
the
monitors
at
their
subsurface
school
had
been
issued
ticklers
on
sharp
interrogation
by
gusterson
however
it
appeared
that
these
last
were
not
ticklers
but
merely
radios
linked
to
the
school
police
station
transmitter
illustration
which
is
bad
enough
gusterson
commented
later
to
daisy
but
be
even
dirtier
to
think
of
those
superegos
being
strapped
to
kids
shoulders
can
you
imagine
huck
finn
with
a
tickler
tellin
him
when
to
tie
up
the
raft
to
a
and
when
to
take
a
swim
i
bet
fay
could
daisy
countered
when
he
going
to
bring
you
that
check
anyhow
iago
wants
a
jetcycle
and
i
promised
imogene
a
vina
kit
and
then
claudius
have
to
have
something
gusterson
scowled
thoughtfully
you
know
daze
he
said
i
got
a
feeling
fay
in
the
hospital
all
narcotized
up
and
being
fed
intravenously
the
way
he
was
jumping
around
last
time
that
tickler
was
going
to
cootch
him
to
pieces
in
a
week
as
if
to
refute
this
intuition
fay
turned
up
that
very
evening
the
lights
were
dim
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
building
old
transformer
and
pending
repairs
the
two
remaining
occupied
apartments
were
making
do
with
batteries
which
turned
bright
globes
to
mysterious
amber
candles
and
made
gusterson
ancient
typewriter
operate
sluggishly
fay
manner
was
subdued
or
at
least
closely
controlled
and
for
a
moment
gusterson
thought
he
shed
his
tickler
then
the
little
man
came
out
of
the
shadows
and
gusterson
saw
the
large
bulge
on
his
right
shoulder
illustration
yes
we
had
to
up
it
a
bit
sizewise
fay
explained
in
clipped
tones
additional
while
brilliantly
successful
on
the
whole
the
subliminal
euphorics
were
a
shade
too
effective
several
hundred
users
went
hoppity
manic
we
gentled
the
cootch
and
qualified
the
subliminals
you
know
by
day
in
every
way
i
getting
sharper
more
but
a
stabilizing
influence
was
still
needed
so
after
a
conference
we
decided
to
combine
tickler
with
moodmaster
my
god
gusterson
interjected
do
they
have
a
machine
now
that
does
that
of
course
they
been
using
them
on
patients
for
years
i
just
do
keep
up
with
progress
gusterson
said
shaking
his
head
bleakly
i
falling
behind
on
all
fronts
you
ought
to
have
your
tickler
remind
you
to
read
science
service
releases
fay
told
him
or
simply
instruct
it
to
scan
the
releases
and
no
that
still
in
research
he
looked
at
gusterson
shoulder
and
his
eyes
widened
you
not
wearing
the
tickler
i
sent
you
he
said
accusingly
i
never
got
it
gusterson
assured
him
postmen
deliver
topside
mail
and
parcels
by
throwing
them
on
the
garbage
boosts
and
hoping
a
tornado
will
blow
them
to
the
right
addresses
then
he
added
helpfully
maybe
the
russians
stole
it
while
it
was
riding
the
whirlwinds
that
not
a
suitable
topic
for
jesting
fay
frowned
we
hoping
that
tickler
will
mobilize
the
full
potential
of
the
free
world
for
the
first
time
in
history
gusterson
you
are
going
to
have
to
wear
a
it
becoming
impossible
for
a
man
to
get
through
modern
life
without
one
maybe
i
will
gusterson
said
appeasingly
but
right
now
tell
me
about
moodmaster
i
want
to
put
it
in
my
new
insanity
novel
fay
shook
his
head
your
readers
will
just
think
you
behind
the
times
if
you
use
it
underplay
it
but
anyhow
moodmaster
is
a
simple
physiotherapy
engine
that
monitors
bloodstream
chemicals
and
body
electricity
it
ties
directly
into
the
bloodstream
keeping
blood
sugar
et
cetera
at
optimum
levels
and
injecting
euphrin
or
depressin
as
necessary
and
occasionally
a
touch
of
extra
adrenaline
as
during
work
emergencies
is
it
painful
daisy
called
from
the
bedroom
excruciating
gusterson
called
back
excuse
it
please
he
grinned
at
fay
hey
did
i
suggest
cocaine
injections
last
time
i
saw
you
so
you
did
fay
agreed
flatly
oh
by
the
way
gussy
here
that
check
for
a
yard
i
promised
you
micro
does
muzzle
the
ox
hooray
daisy
cheered
faintly
i
thought
you
said
it
was
going
to
be
for
two
gusterson
complained
budgeting
always
forces
a
compromise
fay
shrugged
you
have
to
learn
to
accept
those
things
i
love
accepting
money
and
i
glad
any
time
for
three
feet
daisy
called
agreeably
six
feet
might
make
me
wonder
if
i
were
an
insect
but
getting
a
yard
just
makes
me
feel
like
a
gangster
moll
want
to
come
out
and
gloat
over
the
yard
paper
toots
and
stuff
it
in
your
net
stocking
top
gusterson
called
back
no
i
doing
something
to
that
portion
of
me
just
now
but
hang
onto
the
yard
gusterson
he
assured
her
then
turning
back
to
fay
so
you
taken
the
coué
repeating
out
of
the
tickler
oh
no
just
balanced
it
off
with
depressin
the
subliminals
are
still
a
prime
all
the
tickler
features
are
cumulative
gussy
you
still
underestimating
the
scope
of
the
device
i
guess
i
am
what
this
business
if
using
the
tickler
to
inject
drugs
into
workers
to
keep
them
going
that
really
just
my
cocaine
suggestion
modernized
and
i
putting
in
for
another
thou
hundreds
of
years
ago
the
south
american
indians
chewed
coca
leaves
to
kill
fatigue
sensations
that
so
interesting
and
it
proves
priority
for
the
indians
it
i
make
a
try
for
you
gussy
but
do
expect
anything
he
cleared
his
throat
his
eyes
grew
distant
and
turning
his
head
a
little
to
the
right
he
enunciated
sharply
time
inst
oh
five
one
oh
five
seven
oh
oh
record
gussy
coca
thou
budget
cut
he
explained
we
got
a
setter
now
on
the
deluxe
models
you
can
record
a
memo
to
yourself
without
taking
off
your
shirt
incidentally
i
use
the
ends
of
the
hours
for
already
used
up
the
and
eights
for
tomorrow
and
started
on
the
i
understood
most
of
your
memo
gusterson
told
him
gruffly
the
last
oh
was
for
seconds
was
it
now
i
call
that
crude
why
not
microseconds
too
but
how
do
you
remember
where
you
made
a
memo
so
you
do
rerecord
over
it
after
all
you
rerecording
over
the
wallpaper
all
the
time
tickler
beeps
and
then
hunts
for
the
nearest
space
i
see
and
what
the
for
fay
smiled
cut
my
password
for
activating
the
setter
so
it
respond
to
chance
numerals
it
overhears
but
why
fay
grinned
cut
and
you
a
writer
it
a
literary
reference
gussy
cut
was
lord
high
everything
else
in
he
had
a
little
list
and
nothing
on
it
would
ever
be
missed
oh
yeah
gusterson
remembered
glowering
as
i
recall
it
all
that
went
on
that
list
was
the
names
of
people
who
were
slated
to
have
their
heads
chopped
off
by
better
watch
your
step
shorty
it
may
be
a
omen
maybe
all
those
workers
you
ticklers
on
to
pump
them
full
of
adrenaline
so
they
overwork
without
noticin
it
will
revolt
and
come
out
some
day
choppin
for
your
head
spare
me
the
marxist
mythology
fay
protested
gussy
you
got
a
completely
wrong
slant
on
tickler
it
true
that
most
of
our
mass
sales
so
far
bar
government
and
army
have
been
to
large
companies
purchasing
for
their
employees
but
that
because
there
nothing
like
a
tickler
for
teaching
a
new
man
his
job
it
tells
him
from
instant
to
instant
what
he
must
do
while
he
already
on
the
job
and
without
disturbing
other
workers
magnetizing
a
wire
with
a
job
pattern
is
the
easiest
thing
going
and
you
be
astonished
what
the
subliminals
do
for
employee
morale
it
this
way
gussy
most
people
are
too
improvident
and
unimaginative
to
see
in
advance
the
advantages
of
ticklers
they
buy
one
because
the
company
strongly
suggests
it
and
payment
is
on
easy
installments
withheld
from
salary
they
find
a
tickler
makes
the
work
day
go
easier
the
little
fellow
perched
on
your
shoulder
is
a
friend
exuding
comfort
and
good
advice
the
first
thing
he
set
to
say
is
it
easy
pal
within
a
week
they
wearing
their
tickler
hours
a
day
and
buying
a
tickler
for
the
wife
so
she
remember
to
comb
her
hair
and
smile
real
pretty
and
cook
favorite
dishes
i
get
it
fay
gusterson
cut
in
the
tickler
is
the
newest
fad
for
increasing
worker
efficiency
once
i
read
somewheres
it
was
salt
tablets
they
had
dispensers
everywhere
even
in
offices
where
there
was
a
moist
armpit
twice
a
year
and
the
gals
sweat
only
champagne
a
decade
later
people
wondered
what
all
those
dusty
white
pills
were
for
sometimes
they
were
mistook
for
tranquilizers
it
be
the
same
way
with
ticklers
somebody
open
a
musty
closet
and
see
jumbled
heaps
of
these
silvery
gadgets
gathering
dust
curls
and
they
will
not
fay
protested
vehemently
ticklers
are
not
a
fad
they
they
revolutionary
why
before
micro
systems
put
a
single
one
on
the
market
we
made
it
a
rule
that
every
micro
employee
had
to
wear
one
if
that
not
having
supreme
confidence
in
a
product
every
employee
except
the
top
executives
of
course
gusterson
interrupted
jeeringly
and
that
not
demoting
you
fay
as
the
r
d
chief
most
closely
involved
you
naturally
have
to
show
special
enthusiasm
but
you
wrong
there
gussy
fay
crowed
man
for
man
our
top
executives
have
been
more
enthusiastic
about
their
personal
ticklers
than
any
other
class
of
worker
in
the
whole
outfit
gusterson
slumped
and
shook
his
head
if
that
the
case
he
said
darkly
maybe
mankind
deserves
the
tickler
i
say
it
does
fay
agreed
loudly
without
thinking
then
oh
can
the
carping
gussy
tickler
a
great
invention
do
deprecate
it
just
because
you
had
something
to
do
with
its
genesis
you
going
to
have
to
get
in
the
swim
and
wear
one
maybe
i
rather
drown
horribly
can
the
too
gussy
i
said
it
before
and
i
say
it
again
you
just
scared
of
this
new
thing
why
you
even
got
the
drapes
pulled
so
you
wo
have
to
look
at
the
tickler
factory
yes
i
am
scared
gusterson
said
really
sca
awp
fay
whirled
around
daisy
was
standing
in
the
bedroom
doorway
wearing
the
short
silver
sheath
this
time
there
was
no
mask
but
her
bobbed
hair
was
glitteringly
silvered
while
her
legs
arms
hands
neck
face
every
bit
of
her
exposed
skin
was
painted
with
beautifully
even
vertical
green
stripes
i
did
it
as
a
surprise
for
gusterson
she
explained
to
fay
he
says
he
likes
me
this
way
the
green
glop
supposed
to
be
smudgeproof
gusterson
did
not
comment
his
face
had
a
rapt
expression
i
tell
you
why
your
tickler
so
popular
fay
he
said
softly
it
not
because
it
backstops
the
memory
or
because
it
boosts
the
ego
with
subliminals
it
because
it
takes
the
hook
out
of
a
guy
it
takes
over
the
job
of
withstanding
the
pressure
of
living
see
fay
here
are
all
these
little
guys
in
this
subterranean
rat
race
with
squares
and
reward
squares
and
enough
money
if
you
pass
go
almost
to
get
to
go
again
and
a
million
million
rules
of
the
game
to
keep
in
mind
well
here
this
one
little
guy
and
every
morning
he
wakes
up
there
all
these
things
he
got
to
keep
in
mind
to
do
or
he
lose
his
turn
three
times
in
a
row
and
maybe
a
terrible
black
rook
in
iron
armor
loom
up
and
bang
him
off
the
chessboard
but
now
look
now
he
got
his
tickler
and
he
tells
his
sweet
silver
tickler
all
these
things
and
the
tickler
got
to
remember
them
of
course
he
have
to
do
them
eventually
but
meanwhile
the
pressure
off
him
the
hook
out
of
his
short
hairs
he
shifted
the
responsibility
well
what
so
bad
about
that
fay
broke
in
loudly
what
wrong
with
taking
the
pressure
off
little
guys
why
should
tickler
be
a
surrogate
micro
motivations
chief
noticed
that
positive
feature
straight
off
and
scored
it
three
pluses
besides
it
nothing
but
a
gaudy
way
of
saying
that
tickler
backstops
the
memory
seriously
gussy
what
so
bad
about
it
i
do
know
gusterson
said
slowly
his
eyes
still
far
away
i
just
know
it
feels
bad
to
me
he
crinkled
his
big
forehead
well
for
one
thing
he
said
it
means
that
a
man
taking
orders
from
something
else
he
got
a
kind
of
master
he
sinking
back
into
a
slave
psychology
he
only
taking
orders
from
himself
fay
countered
disgustedly
tickler
just
a
mech
reminder
a
notebook
in
essence
no
more
than
the
back
of
an
old
envelope
it
no
master
are
you
absolutely
sure
of
that
gusterson
asked
quietly
why
gussy
you
big
oaf
fay
began
heatedly
suddenly
his
features
quirked
and
he
twitched
me
folks
he
said
rapidly
heading
for
the
door
but
my
tickler
told
me
i
got
ta
go
hey
fay
do
you
mean
you
told
your
tickler
to
tell
you
when
it
was
time
to
go
gusterson
called
after
him
fay
looked
back
in
the
doorway
he
wet
his
lips
his
eyes
moved
from
side
to
side
i
not
quite
sure
he
said
in
an
odd
strained
voice
and
darted
out
gusterson
stared
for
some
seconds
at
the
pattern
of
emptiness
fay
had
left
then
he
shivered
then
he
shrugged
i
must
be
slipping
he
muttered
i
never
even
suggested
something
for
him
to
invent
then
he
looked
around
at
daisy
who
was
still
standing
in
her
doorway
hey
you
look
like
something
out
of
the
arabian
nights
he
told
her
are
you
supposed
to
be
anything
special
how
far
do
those
stripes
go
anyway
you
could
probably
find
out
she
told
him
coolly
all
you
have
to
do
is
kill
me
a
dragon
or
two
first
he
studied
her
my
god
he
said
reverently
i
really
have
all
the
fun
in
life
what
do
i
do
to
deserve
this
you
got
a
big
gun
she
told
him
and
you
go
out
in
the
world
with
it
and
hold
up
big
companies
and
take
yards
and
yards
of
money
away
from
them
in
rolls
like
ribbon
and
bring
it
all
home
to
me
do
say
that
about
the
gun
again
he
said
do
whisper
it
do
even
think
it
i
got
one
dammit
caliber
yet
and
i
do
want
some
psionic
monitor
with
clairaudience
they
have
told
me
about
catching
the
whisper
and
coming
to
take
the
gun
away
from
us
it
one
of
the
few
individuality
symbols
we
got
left
suddenly
daisy
whirled
away
from
the
door
spun
three
times
so
that
her
silvered
hair
stood
out
like
a
metal
coolie
hat
and
sank
to
a
curtsey
in
the
middle
of
the
room
i
just
thought
of
what
i
am
she
announced
fluttering
her
eyelashes
at
him
i
a
sweet
silver
tickler
with
green
stripes
v
next
day
daisy
cashed
the
micro
check
for
ten
hundred
silver
smackers
which
she
hid
in
a
broken
radionic
coffee
urn
gusterson
sold
his
insanity
novel
and
started
a
new
one
about
a
mad
medic
with
a
hiccupy
hysterical
chuckle
who
gimmicked
moodmasters
to
turn
mental
patients
into
nymphomaniacs
mass
murderers
and
compulsive
saints
but
this
time
he
could
get
fay
out
of
his
mind
or
the
last
chilling
words
the
nervous
little
man
had
spoken
for
that
matter
he
could
blank
the
underground
out
of
his
mind
as
effectively
as
usually
he
had
the
feeling
that
a
new
kind
of
mole
was
loose
in
the
burrows
and
that
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
their
skyscraper
might
start
humping
up
any
minute
toward
the
end
of
one
afternoon
he
tucked
a
half
dozen
newly
typed
sheets
in
his
pocket
shrouded
his
typer
went
to
the
hatrack
and
took
down
his
prize
a
miner
cap
with
electric
headlamp
goin
below
he
shouted
toward
the
kitchen
be
back
for
second
dog
watch
daisy
replied
remember
what
i
told
you
about
lassoing
me
some
girl
neighbors
only
if
i
meet
a
piebald
one
with
a
taste
for
scotch
or
maybe
a
pearl
gray
biped
jaguar
with
violet
spots
gusterson
told
her
clapping
on
the
cap
with
a
gesture
halfway
across
the
park
to
the
escalator
bunker
gusterson
heart
began
to
tick
he
resolutely
switched
on
his
headlamp
as
he
known
it
would
the
hatch
robot
whirred
an
extra
and
ten
seconds
when
it
came
to
his
topside
address
but
it
ultimately
dilated
the
hatch
for
him
first
handing
him
a
claim
check
for
his
id
card
gusterson
heart
was
ticking
like
a
sledgehammer
by
now
he
hopped
clumsily
onto
the
escalator
clutched
the
moving
guard
rail
to
either
side
then
shut
his
eyes
as
the
steps
went
over
the
edge
and
became
what
felt
like
vertical
an
instant
later
he
forced
his
eyes
open
unclipped
a
hand
from
the
rail
and
touched
the
second
switch
beside
his
headlamp
which
instantly
began
to
blink
whitely
as
if
he
were
a
civilian
plane
flying
into
a
nest
of
military
jobs
with
a
further
effort
he
kept
his
eyes
open
and
flinchingly
surveyed
the
scene
around
him
after
zigging
through
a
bombproof
of
roof
he
was
dropping
into
a
large
twilit
cave
the
ceiling
twinkled
with
stars
the
walls
were
pierced
at
floor
level
by
a
dozen
archways
with
busy
niche
stores
and
glowing
advertisements
crowded
between
them
from
the
archways
some
three
dozen
slidewalks
curved
out
tangenting
off
each
other
in
a
bewildering
multiple
cloverleaf
the
slidewalks
were
packed
with
people
traveling
motionless
like
purposeful
statues
or
pivoting
with
practiced
grace
from
one
slidewalk
to
another
like
a
thousand
toreros
doing
veronicas
the
slidewalks
were
moving
faster
than
he
recalled
from
his
last
venture
underground
and
at
the
same
time
the
whole
pedestrian
concourse
was
quieter
than
he
remembered
it
was
as
if
the
five
thousand
or
so
moles
in
view
were
all
listening
for
what
but
there
was
something
else
that
had
changed
about
them
a
change
that
he
could
for
a
moment
define
or
unconsciously
did
want
to
clothing
style
no
my
god
they
were
all
wearing
identical
monster
masks
no
hair
color
well
he
was
studying
them
so
intently
that
he
forgot
his
escalator
was
landing
he
came
off
it
with
a
stumble
and
bumped
into
a
knot
of
four
men
on
the
tiny
triangular
these
four
at
least
sported
a
new
ribbed
gray
that
made
them
look
as
if
their
heads
were
poking
up
out
of
the
center
of
bulgy
umbrellas
or
giant
mushrooms
one
of
them
grabbed
hold
of
gusterson
and
saved
him
from
staggering
onto
a
slidewalk
that
might
have
carried
him
to
toledo
gussy
you
dog
you
must
have
esped
i
wanted
to
see
you
fay
cried
patting
him
on
the
elbows
meet
davidson
and
kester
and
hazen
colleagues
of
mine
we
all
fay
companions
were
staring
strangely
at
gusterson
blinking
headlamp
fay
explained
rapidly
gusterson
is
an
insanity
novelist
you
know
spells
gusterson
said
absently
still
staring
at
the
interweaving
crowd
beyond
them
trying
to
figure
out
what
made
them
different
from
last
trip
creativity
fuel
cranky
explodes
through
the
parietal
fissure
if
you
look
at
it
fay
laughed
well
boys
i
found
my
man
how
the
new
novel
perking
gussy
got
my
climax
i
think
gusterson
mumbled
still
peering
puzzledly
around
fay
at
the
slidestanders
moodmaster
going
to
come
alive
ever
occur
to
you
that
is
spelled
backwards
and
then
he
let
his
voice
trail
off
as
he
realized
that
kester
and
davidson
and
hazen
had
made
their
farewells
and
were
sliding
into
the
distance
he
reminded
himself
wryly
that
nobody
ever
wants
to
hear
an
author
talk
he
much
too
good
a
listener
to
be
wasted
that
way
let
see
was
it
that
everybody
in
the
crowd
had
the
same
facial
expression
or
showed
symptoms
of
the
same
disease
i
was
coming
to
visit
you
but
now
you
can
pay
me
a
call
fay
was
saying
there
are
two
matters
i
want
to
gusterson
stiffened
my
god
all
he
yelled
shh
of
course
they
are
fay
whispered
reprovingly
they
all
wearing
their
ticklers
but
you
do
need
to
be
insulting
about
it
gettin
out
o
gusterson
turned
to
flee
as
if
from
five
thousand
richard
the
thirds
oh
no
you
not
fay
amended
drawing
him
back
with
one
hand
somehow
underground
the
little
man
seemed
to
carry
more
weight
you
having
cocktails
in
my
thinking
box
besides
climbing
a
down
escaladder
will
give
you
a
heart
attack
in
his
home
habitat
gusterson
was
about
as
easy
to
handle
as
a
rogue
rhinoceros
but
away
from
it
and
especially
if
underground
he
became
more
like
a
pliable
elephant
all
his
bones
dropped
out
through
his
feet
as
he
described
it
to
daisy
so
now
he
submitted
miserably
as
fay
surveyed
him
up
and
down
switched
off
his
blinking
headlamp
that
coalminer
caper
is
corny
gussy
and
then
surprisingly
rapidly
stuffed
his
under
the
right
shoulder
of
gusterson
coat
and
buttoned
the
latter
to
hold
it
in
place
so
you
wo
stand
out
he
explained
another
swift
survey
do
come
on
gussy
i
got
lots
to
brief
you
on
three
rapid
paces
and
then
gusterson
feet
would
have
gone
out
from
under
him
except
that
fay
gave
him
a
mighty
shove
the
small
man
sprang
onto
the
slidewalk
after
him
and
then
they
were
skimming
effortlessly
side
by
side
gusterson
felt
frightened
and
twice
as
hunchbacked
as
the
slidestanders
around
him
morally
as
well
as
physically
nevertheless
he
countered
bravely
i
got
things
to
brief
on
i
got
six
pages
of
cautions
on
ti
shh
fay
stopped
him
let
use
my
hushbox
he
drew
out
his
pancake
phone
and
stretched
it
so
that
it
covered
both
their
lower
faces
like
a
double
yashmak
gusterson
his
neck
pushing
into
the
ribbed
bulge
of
the
shoulder
cape
so
he
could
be
cheek
to
cheek
with
fay
felt
horribly
conspicuous
but
then
he
noticed
that
none
of
the
slidestanders
were
paying
them
the
least
attention
the
reason
for
their
abstraction
occurred
to
him
they
were
listening
to
their
ticklers
he
shuddered
i
got
six
pages
of
caution
on
ticklers
he
repeated
into
the
hot
moist
quiet
of
the
pancake
phone
i
typed
so
i
would
forget
in
the
heat
of
polemicking
i
want
you
to
read
every
word
fay
i
had
it
on
my
mind
ever
since
i
started
wondering
whether
it
was
you
or
your
tickler
made
you
duck
out
of
our
place
last
time
you
were
there
i
want
you
to
all
in
good
time
in
the
pancake
phone
fay
laugh
was
brassy
but
i
glad
you
decided
to
lend
a
hand
gussy
this
thing
is
moving
faaaasst
nationwise
adult
underground
ticklerization
is
per
cent
complete
i
do
believe
that
gusterson
protested
while
glaring
at
the
hunchbacks
around
them
the
slidewalk
was
gliding
down
a
low
tunnel
lined
with
doors
and
advertisements
people
were
pirouetting
on
and
off
a
thing
just
ca
develop
that
fast
fay
it
against
nature
ha
but
we
not
in
nature
we
in
culture
the
progress
of
an
industrial
scientific
culture
is
geometric
it
goes
as
many
jumps
as
it
takes
more
than
geometric
exponential
confidentially
micro
math
chief
tells
me
we
currently
on
a
progress
curve
trending
into
a
fifth
you
mean
we
goin
so
fast
we
got
to
watch
out
we
do
bump
ourselves
in
the
rear
when
we
come
around
again
gusterson
asked
scanning
the
tunnel
ahead
for
curves
or
just
shoot
straight
up
to
infinity
exactly
of
course
most
of
the
last
power
and
a
half
is
due
to
tickler
itself
gussy
the
tickler
already
eliminated
absenteeism
alcoholism
and
aboulia
in
numerous
urban
areas
and
that
just
one
letter
of
the
alphabet
if
tickler
does
turn
us
into
a
nation
of
geniuses
in
six
months
i
come
live
topside
you
mean
because
a
lot
of
people
are
standing
around
listening
to
something
mumbling
in
their
ear
that
it
a
good
thing
gussy
you
do
know
progress
when
you
see
it
tickler
is
the
greatest
invention
since
language
bar
none
it
the
greatest
instrument
ever
devised
for
integrating
a
man
into
all
phases
of
his
environment
under
the
present
routine
a
newly
purchased
tickler
first
goes
to
government
and
civilian
defense
for
primary
patterning
then
to
the
purchaser
employer
then
to
his
then
to
his
local
bunker
captain
then
to
that
needful
for
a
man
welfare
gets
on
the
spools
efficiency
cubed
incidentally
russia
got
the
tickler
now
our
have
photographed
it
it
like
ours
except
the
commies
wear
it
on
the
left
shoulder
but
they
two
weeks
behind
us
developmentwise
and
they
never
close
the
gap
gusterson
reared
up
out
of
the
pancake
phone
to
take
a
deep
breath
a
girl
two
feet
from
him
twitched
medium
cootch
he
judged
then
fumbled
in
her
for
a
pill
and
popped
it
in
her
mouth
hell
the
tickler
not
even
efficient
yet
about
little
things
gusterson
blatted
diving
back
into
the
he
was
sharing
with
fay
why
that
girl
doctor
have
the
moodmaster
component
of
her
tickler
inject
her
with
medicine
her
doctor
probably
wants
her
to
have
the
discipline
of
or
the
exercise
fay
answered
glibly
look
sharp
now
here
where
we
fork
i
taking
you
through
micro
postern
a
ribbon
of
slidewalk
split
itself
from
the
main
band
and
angled
off
into
a
short
alley
gusterson
hardly
felt
the
juncture
as
they
crossed
it
then
the
secondary
ribbon
speeded
up
carrying
them
at
about
feet
a
second
toward
the
blank
concrete
wall
in
which
the
alley
ended
gusterson
prepared
to
jump
but
fay
grabbed
him
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
held
up
toward
the
wall
a
badge
and
a
button
when
they
were
about
ten
feet
away
the
wall
whipped
aside
then
whipped
shut
behind
them
so
fast
that
gusterson
wondered
momentarily
if
he
still
had
his
heels
and
the
seat
of
his
pants
fay
tucking
away
his
badge
and
pancake
phone
dropped
the
button
in
gusterson
vest
pocket
use
it
when
you
leave
he
said
casually
that
is
if
you
leave
gusterson
who
was
trying
to
read
the
do
and
do
posters
papering
the
walls
they
were
passing
started
to
probe
that
last
sinister
supposition
but
just
then
the
ribbon
slowed
a
swinging
door
opened
and
closed
behind
them
and
they
found
themselves
in
a
luxuriously
furnished
thinking
box
measuring
at
least
eight
feet
by
five
hey
this
is
something
gusterson
said
appreciatively
to
show
he
was
an
utter
yokel
then
drawing
on
research
he
done
for
period
novels
why
it
as
big
as
a
pullman
car
compartment
or
a
first
mate
cabin
in
the
war
of
you
really
must
rate
fay
nodded
smiled
wanly
and
sat
down
with
a
sigh
on
a
compact
overstuffed
swivel
chair
he
let
his
arms
dangle
and
his
head
sink
into
his
puffed
shoulder
cape
gusterson
stared
at
him
it
was
the
first
time
he
could
ever
recall
the
little
man
showing
fatigue
tickler
currently
does
have
one
serious
drawback
fay
volunteered
it
weighs
pounds
you
feel
it
when
you
been
on
your
feet
a
couple
of
hours
no
question
we
going
to
give
the
next
model
that
antigravity
feature
you
mentioned
for
pursuit
grenades
we
have
had
it
in
this
model
except
there
were
so
many
other
things
to
be
incorporated
he
sighed
again
why
the
scanning
and
elements
alone
tripled
the
mass
hey
gusterson
protested
thinking
especially
of
the
girl
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
all
those
other
people
were
toting
two
stone
fay
shook
his
head
heavily
they
were
all
wearing
mark
or
wearing
mark
he
said
as
one
might
say
i
carrying
the
genuine
cross
not
one
of
the
balsa
ones
but
then
his
face
brightened
a
little
and
he
went
on
of
course
the
new
improved
features
make
it
more
than
worth
it
and
you
hardly
feel
it
at
all
at
night
when
you
lying
down
and
if
you
remember
to
talcum
under
it
twice
a
day
no
sores
develop
at
least
not
very
big
ones
backing
away
involuntarily
gusterson
felt
something
prod
his
right
shoulderblade
ripping
open
his
coat
he
convulsively
plunged
his
hand
under
it
and
tore
out
fay
and
then
set
it
down
very
gently
on
the
top
of
a
shallow
cabinet
and
relaxed
with
the
sigh
of
one
who
has
escaped
a
great
if
symbolic
danger
then
he
remembered
something
fay
had
mentioned
he
straightened
again
hey
you
said
it
got
scanning
and
elements
that
means
your
tickler
thinks
even
by
your
fancy
standards
and
if
it
thinks
it
conscious
gussy
fay
said
wearily
frowning
all
sorts
of
things
nowadays
have
s
dm
elements
mail
sorters
missiles
robot
medics
mannequins
just
to
name
some
of
the
ms
they
to
use
that
archaic
word
but
it
neither
here
nor
there
and
they
certainly
not
conscious
your
tickler
thinks
gusterson
repeated
stubbornly
just
like
i
warned
you
it
would
it
sits
on
your
shoulder
ridin
you
like
you
was
a
pony
or
a
starved
bernard
and
now
it
thinks
suppose
it
does
fay
yawned
what
of
it
he
gave
a
rapid
sinuous
shrug
that
made
it
look
for
a
moment
as
if
his
left
arm
had
three
elbows
it
stuck
in
gusterson
mind
for
he
had
never
seen
fay
use
such
a
gesture
and
he
wondered
where
he
picked
it
up
maybe
imitating
a
micro
finance
chief
fay
yawned
again
and
said
please
gussy
do
disturb
me
for
a
minute
or
so
his
eyes
half
closed
gusterson
studied
fay
face
and
the
great
puff
of
his
shoulder
cape
say
fay
he
asked
in
a
soft
voice
after
about
five
minutes
are
you
meditating
why
no
fay
responded
starting
up
and
then
stifling
another
yawn
just
resting
a
bit
i
seem
to
get
more
tired
these
days
somehow
you
have
to
excuse
me
gussy
but
what
made
you
think
of
meditation
oh
i
just
got
to
wonderin
in
that
direction
gusterson
said
you
see
when
you
first
started
to
develop
tickler
it
occurred
to
me
that
there
was
one
thing
about
it
that
might
be
real
good
even
if
you
did
give
it
s
dm
elements
it
this
having
a
mech
secretary
to
take
charge
of
his
obligations
and
routine
in
the
real
world
might
allow
a
man
to
slide
into
the
other
world
the
world
of
thoughts
and
feelings
and
intuitions
and
sort
of
ooze
around
in
there
and
accomplish
things
know
any
of
the
people
using
tickler
that
way
hey
of
course
not
fay
denied
with
a
bright
incredulous
laugh
want
to
loaf
around
in
an
imaginary
world
and
take
a
chance
of
out
on
what
his
tickler
i
mean
on
what
his
tickler
has
in
store
for
him
what
he
his
tickler
to
have
in
store
for
him
ignoring
gusterson
shiver
fay
straightened
up
and
seemed
to
brisken
himself
ha
that
little
slump
did
me
good
a
tickler
you
rest
you
know
it
one
of
the
great
things
about
it
kinder
to
me
than
i
ever
was
to
myself
he
buttoned
open
a
tiny
refrigerator
and
took
out
two
waxed
cardboard
cubes
and
handed
one
to
gusterson
martini
hope
you
do
mind
drinking
from
the
carton
cheers
now
gussy
old
pal
there
are
two
matters
i
want
to
take
up
with
you
hold
it
gusterson
said
with
something
of
his
old
authority
there
something
i
got
to
get
off
my
mind
first
he
pulled
the
typed
pages
out
of
his
inside
pocket
and
straightened
them
i
told
you
about
these
he
said
i
want
you
to
read
them
before
you
do
anything
else
here
fay
looked
toward
the
pages
and
nodded
but
did
not
take
them
yet
he
lifted
his
hands
to
his
throat
and
unhooked
the
clasp
of
his
cape
then
hesitated
you
wear
that
thing
to
hide
the
hump
your
tickler
makes
gusterson
filled
in
you
got
better
taste
than
those
other
moles
not
to
hide
it
exactly
fay
protested
but
just
so
the
others
wo
be
jealous
i
would
feel
comfortable
parading
a
mark
tickler
in
front
of
people
who
ca
buy
it
until
it
goes
on
open
sale
at
fifteen
tonight
lot
of
shelterfolk
wo
be
sleeping
tonight
they
be
queued
up
to
trade
in
their
old
tickler
for
a
mark
almost
as
good
as
he
started
to
jerk
his
hands
apart
hesitated
again
with
an
oddly
apprehensive
look
at
the
big
man
then
whirled
off
the
cape
vi
gusterson
sucked
in
such
a
big
gasp
that
he
hiccuped
the
right
shoulder
of
fay
jacket
and
shirt
had
been
cut
away
thrusting
up
through
the
neatly
hemmed
hole
was
a
silvery
gray
hump
with
a
turret
atop
it
and
two
metal
arms
ending
in
little
claws
it
looked
like
the
top
half
of
a
robot
a
squat
evil
child
robot
gusterson
told
himself
which
had
lost
its
legs
in
a
railway
accident
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
red
fleck
was
moving
around
imperceptibly
in
the
huge
single
eye
i
take
that
memo
now
fay
said
coolly
reaching
out
his
hand
he
caught
the
rustling
sheets
as
they
slipped
from
gusterson
fingers
evened
them
up
very
precisely
by
tapping
them
on
his
knee
and
then
handed
them
over
his
shoulder
to
his
tickler
which
clicked
its
claws
around
either
margin
and
then
began
rather
swiftly
to
lift
the
top
sheet
past
its
single
eye
at
a
distance
of
about
six
inches
the
first
matter
i
want
to
take
up
with
you
gussy
fay
began
paying
no
attention
whatsoever
to
the
little
scene
on
his
shoulder
or
warn
you
about
rather
is
the
imminent
ticklerization
of
schoolchildren
geriatrics
convicts
and
topsiders
at
three
zero
zero
tomorrow
ticklers
become
mandatory
for
all
adult
shelterfolk
the
operations
wo
be
long
in
coming
in
fact
these
days
we
find
that
the
square
root
of
the
estimated
time
of
a
new
development
is
generally
the
best
time
estimate
gussy
i
strongly
advise
you
to
start
wearing
a
tickler
now
and
daisy
and
your
moppets
if
you
heed
my
advice
your
kids
will
have
the
jump
on
your
class
transition
and
conditioning
are
easy
since
tickler
itself
sees
to
it
leafed
the
first
page
to
the
back
of
the
packet
and
began
lifting
the
second
past
his
eye
a
little
more
swiftly
than
the
first
i
got
a
mark
tickler
all
warmed
up
for
you
fay
pressed
a
shoulder
cape
you
wo
feel
one
bit
conspicuous
he
noticed
the
direction
of
gusterson
gaze
and
remarked
fascinating
mechanism
is
it
of
course
pounds
are
a
bit
oppressive
but
then
you
have
to
remember
it
only
a
to
mark
or
finished
page
two
and
began
to
race
through
page
three
but
i
wanted
to
read
it
gusterson
said
bemusedly
staring
will
do
a
better
job
than
i
could
fay
assured
him
get
the
gist
without
losing
the
chaff
but
dammit
it
all
about
gusterson
said
a
little
more
strongly
he
wo
be
objective
about
it
a
better
job
fay
reiterated
more
fully
objective
set
for
full
precis
stop
worrying
about
it
he
a
dispassionate
machine
not
a
fallible
emotionally
disturbed
human
misled
by
the
of
consciousness
second
matter
micro
systems
is
impressed
by
your
contributions
to
tickler
and
will
recruit
you
as
a
senior
consultant
with
a
salary
and
thinking
box
as
big
as
my
own
family
quarters
to
match
it
an
high
start
gussy
i
think
you
be
a
fool
illustration
he
broke
off
held
up
a
hand
for
silence
and
his
eyes
got
a
listening
look
had
finished
page
six
and
was
holding
the
packet
motionless
after
about
ten
seconds
fay
face
broke
into
a
big
fake
smile
he
stood
up
suppressing
a
wince
and
held
out
his
hand
gussy
he
said
loudly
i
am
happy
to
inform
you
that
all
your
fears
about
tickler
are
so
much
thistledown
my
word
on
it
there
nothing
to
them
at
all
precis
which
he
just
given
to
me
proves
it
look
gusterson
said
solemnly
there
one
thing
i
want
you
to
do
purely
to
humor
an
old
friend
but
i
want
you
to
do
it
that
memo
certainly
i
will
gussy
fay
continued
in
the
same
ebullient
tones
i
read
it
he
twitched
and
his
smile
disappeared
a
little
later
sure
gusterson
said
dully
holding
his
hand
to
his
stomach
and
now
if
you
do
mind
fay
i
goin
home
i
feel
just
a
bit
sick
maybe
the
ozone
and
the
other
additives
in
your
shelter
air
are
too
heady
for
me
it
been
years
since
i
tramped
through
a
pine
forest
but
gussy
you
hardly
got
here
you
have
even
sat
down
have
another
martini
have
a
seltzer
pill
have
a
whiff
of
oxy
have
a
no
fay
i
going
home
right
away
i
think
about
the
job
offer
to
read
that
i
will
gussy
i
certainly
will
you
know
your
way
the
button
takes
you
through
the
wall
now
he
sat
down
abruptly
and
looked
away
gusterson
pushed
through
the
swinging
door
he
tensed
himself
for
the
step
across
onto
the
reverse
ribbon
then
on
a
impulse
he
pushed
ajar
the
swinging
door
and
looked
back
inside
fay
was
sitting
as
he
left
him
apparently
lost
in
listless
brooding
on
his
shoulder
was
rapidly
crossing
and
uncrossing
its
little
metal
arms
tearing
the
memo
to
smaller
and
smaller
shreds
it
let
the
scraps
drift
slowly
toward
the
floor
and
oddly
writhed
its
left
arm
and
then
gusterson
knew
from
whom
or
rather
from
what
fay
had
copied
his
new
shrug
vii
when
gusterson
got
home
toward
the
end
of
the
second
dog
watch
he
slipped
aside
from
daisy
questions
and
set
the
children
laughing
with
a
graphic
enactment
of
his
slidestanding
technique
and
a
story
about
getting
his
head
caught
in
a
thinking
box
built
for
a
midget
physicist
after
supper
he
played
with
imogene
iago
and
claudius
until
it
was
their
bedtime
and
thereafter
was
unusually
attentive
to
daisy
admiring
her
fading
green
stripes
though
he
did
spend
a
while
in
the
next
apartment
where
they
stored
their
outdoor
camping
equipment
but
the
next
morning
he
announced
to
the
children
that
it
was
a
holiday
the
feast
of
gusterson
and
then
took
daisy
into
the
bedroom
and
told
her
everything
when
he
finished
she
said
this
is
something
i
got
to
see
for
myself
gusterson
shrugged
if
you
think
you
got
to
i
say
we
should
head
for
the
hills
right
now
one
thing
i
standing
on
the
kids
going
back
to
school
agreed
daisy
said
but
gusterson
we
lived
through
a
lot
of
things
without
leaving
home
altogether
we
lived
through
the
campaign
and
the
robot
watchdog
craze
when
you
got
your
left
foot
half
chewed
off
we
lived
through
the
venomous
bats
and
indoctrinated
saboteur
rats
and
the
hypnotized
monkey
paratrooper
scares
we
lived
through
the
voice
of
safety
and
and
rightest
pills
and
vigilantes
we
lived
through
the
when
you
were
supposed
to
turn
on
a
toaster
for
fear
its
heat
would
be
a
target
for
prowl
missiles
and
when
people
with
fevers
were
unpopular
we
lived
through
gusterson
patted
her
hand
you
go
below
he
said
come
back
when
you
decided
this
is
different
come
back
as
soon
as
you
can
anyway
i
be
worried
about
you
every
minute
you
down
there
when
she
was
gone
in
a
green
suit
and
hat
to
minimize
or
at
least
justify
the
effect
of
the
faded
stripes
gusterson
doled
out
to
the
children
provender
and
equipment
for
a
camping
expedition
to
the
next
floor
iago
led
them
off
in
stealthy
indian
file
leaving
the
hall
door
open
gusterson
got
out
his
and
cleaned
and
loaded
it
meanwhile
concentrating
on
a
chess
problem
with
the
idea
of
confusing
a
hypothetical
psionic
monitor
by
the
time
he
had
hid
the
revolver
again
he
heard
the
elevator
creaking
back
up
daisy
came
dragging
in
without
her
hat
looking
as
if
she
been
concentrating
on
a
chess
problem
for
hours
herself
and
just
now
given
up
her
stripes
seemed
to
have
vanished
then
gusterson
decided
this
was
because
her
whole
complexion
was
a
touch
green
she
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
couch
and
said
without
looking
at
him
did
you
tell
me
gusterson
that
everybody
was
quiet
and
abstracted
and
orderly
down
below
especially
the
ones
wearing
ticklers
meaning
pretty
much
everybody
i
did
he
said
i
take
it
that
no
longer
the
case
what
are
the
new
symptoms
she
gave
no
indication
after
some
time
she
said
gusterson
do
you
remember
the
doré
illustrations
to
the
can
you
visualize
the
paintings
of
hieronymous
bosch
with
the
hordes
of
devils
tormenting
people
all
over
the
farmyard
and
city
square
did
you
ever
see
the
disney
animations
of
moussorgsky
witches
sabbath
music
back
in
the
foolish
days
before
you
married
me
did
that
girl
friend
of
yours
ever
take
you
to
a
genuine
orgy
as
bad
as
that
hey
she
nodded
emphatically
and
all
of
a
sudden
shivered
violently
several
shades
worse
she
said
if
they
decide
to
come
topside
she
shot
up
where
are
the
kids
upstairs
campin
in
the
mysterious
wilderness
of
the
floor
gusterson
reassured
her
let
leave
there
until
we
ready
to
he
broke
off
they
both
heard
the
faint
sound
of
thudding
footsteps
they
on
the
stairs
daisy
whispered
starting
to
move
toward
the
open
door
but
are
they
coming
from
up
or
down
it
just
one
person
judged
gusterson
moving
after
his
wife
too
heavy
for
one
of
the
kids
the
footsteps
doubled
in
volume
and
came
rapidly
closer
along
with
them
there
was
an
agonized
gasping
daisy
stopped
staring
fearfully
at
the
open
doorway
gusterson
moved
past
her
then
he
stopped
too
fay
stumbled
into
view
and
would
have
fallen
on
his
face
except
he
clutched
both
sides
of
the
doorway
halfway
up
he
was
stripped
to
the
waist
there
was
a
little
blood
on
his
shoulder
his
narrow
chest
was
arching
convulsively
the
ribs
standing
out
starkly
as
he
sucked
in
oxygen
to
replace
what
he
burned
up
running
up
twenty
flights
his
eyes
were
wild
they
taken
over
he
panted
another
gobbling
breath
gone
crazy
two
more
gasps
got
ta
stop
his
eyes
filmed
he
swayed
forward
then
gusterson
big
arms
were
around
him
and
he
was
carrying
him
to
the
couch
daisy
came
running
from
the
kitchen
with
a
damp
cool
towel
gusterson
took
it
from
her
and
began
to
mop
fay
off
he
sucked
in
his
own
breath
as
he
saw
that
fay
right
ear
was
raw
and
torn
he
whispered
to
daisy
look
at
where
the
thing
savaged
him
the
blood
on
fay
shoulder
came
from
his
ear
some
of
it
stained
a
plastic
fitting
that
had
two
small
valved
holes
in
it
and
that
puzzled
gusterson
until
he
remembered
that
moodmaster
tied
into
the
bloodstream
for
a
second
he
thought
he
was
going
to
vomit
the
dazed
look
slid
aside
from
fay
eyes
he
was
gasping
less
painfully
now
he
sat
up
pushing
the
towel
away
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
for
a
few
seconds
then
looked
over
the
fingers
at
the
two
of
them
i
been
living
in
a
nightmare
for
the
last
week
he
said
in
a
taut
small
voice
knowing
the
thing
had
come
alive
and
trying
to
pretend
to
myself
that
it
had
knowing
it
was
taking
charge
of
me
more
and
more
having
it
whisper
in
my
ear
over
and
over
again
in
a
cracked
little
rhyme
that
i
could
only
hear
every
hundredth
time
by
day
in
every
way
you
learning
to
listen
and
day
by
day
his
voice
started
to
go
high
he
pulled
it
down
and
continued
harshly
i
ditched
it
this
morning
when
i
showered
it
let
me
break
contact
to
do
that
it
must
have
figured
it
had
complete
control
of
me
mounted
or
dismounted
i
think
it
telepathic
and
then
it
did
some
well
rather
unpleasant
things
to
me
late
last
night
but
i
pulled
together
my
fears
and
my
will
and
i
ran
for
it
the
slidewalks
were
chaos
the
mark
ticklers
showed
some
purpose
though
i
could
tell
you
what
but
as
far
as
i
could
see
the
mark
and
were
just
cootching
their
mounts
to
death
chinese
feather
torture
giggling
gasping
choking
gales
of
mirth
people
are
dying
of
laughter
ticklers
the
irony
of
it
it
was
the
complete
lack
of
order
and
sanity
and
that
let
me
get
topside
there
were
things
i
saw
once
again
his
voice
went
shrill
he
clapped
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
rocked
back
and
forth
on
the
couch
gusterson
gently
but
firmly
laid
a
hand
on
his
good
shoulder
steady
he
said
here
swallow
this
fay
shoved
aside
the
short
brown
drink
we
got
to
stop
them
he
cried
mobilize
the
topsiders
contact
the
wilderness
patrols
and
manned
satellites
pour
ether
in
the
tunnel
airpumps
invent
and
missiles
that
will
home
on
ticklers
without
harming
humans
sos
mars
and
venus
dope
the
shelter
water
supply
do
something
gussy
you
do
realize
what
people
are
going
through
down
there
every
second
i
think
they
experiencing
the
ultimate
in
gusterson
said
gruffly
have
you
no
heart
fay
demanded
his
eyes
widened
as
if
he
were
seeing
gusterson
for
the
first
time
then
accusingly
pointing
a
shaking
finger
invented
the
tickler
george
gusterson
it
all
your
fault
you
got
to
do
something
about
it
before
gusterson
could
retort
to
that
or
begin
to
think
of
a
reply
or
even
assimilate
the
full
enormity
of
fay
statement
he
was
grabbed
from
behind
and
away
from
fay
and
something
that
felt
remarkably
like
the
muzzle
of
a
gun
was
shoved
in
the
small
of
his
back
under
cover
of
fay
outburst
a
huge
crowd
of
people
had
entered
the
room
from
the
hall
eight
to
be
exact
but
the
weirdest
thing
about
them
to
gusterson
was
that
from
the
first
instant
he
had
the
impression
that
only
one
mind
had
entered
the
room
and
that
it
did
not
reside
in
any
of
the
eight
persons
even
though
he
recognized
three
of
them
but
in
something
that
they
were
carrying
several
things
contributed
to
this
impression
the
eight
people
all
had
the
same
blank
expression
watchful
yet
they
all
moved
in
the
same
slithery
crouch
and
they
had
all
taken
off
their
shoes
perhaps
gusterson
thought
wildly
they
believed
he
and
daisy
ran
a
japanese
flat
gusterson
was
being
held
by
two
burly
women
one
of
them
quite
pimply
he
considered
stamping
on
her
toes
but
just
at
that
moment
the
gun
dug
in
his
back
with
a
corkscrew
movement
the
man
holding
the
gun
on
him
was
fay
colleague
davidson
some
yards
beyond
fay
couch
kester
was
holding
a
gun
on
daisy
without
digging
it
into
her
while
the
single
strange
man
holding
daisy
herself
was
doing
so
quite
decorously
a
circumstance
which
afforded
gusterson
minor
relief
since
it
made
him
feel
less
guilty
about
not
going
berserk
two
more
strange
men
one
of
them
in
purple
lounging
pajamas
the
other
in
the
gray
uniform
of
a
slidewalk
inspector
had
grabbed
skinny
upper
arms
one
on
either
side
and
were
lifting
him
to
his
feet
while
fay
was
struggling
with
such
desperate
futility
and
gibbering
so
pitifully
that
gusterson
momentarily
had
second
thoughts
about
the
moral
imperative
to
go
berserk
when
menaced
by
hostile
force
but
again
the
gun
dug
into
him
with
a
twist
approaching
fay
was
the
third
gusterson
had
met
yesterday
hazen
it
was
hazen
who
was
carrying
quite
reverently
or
solemnly
or
at
any
rate
very
carefully
the
object
that
seemed
to
gusterson
to
be
the
mind
of
the
little
storm
troop
presently
desecrating
the
sanctity
of
his
own
individual
home
all
of
them
were
wearing
ticklers
of
course
the
three
the
heavy
emergent
mark
with
their
clawed
and
jointed
arms
and
monocular
cephalic
turrets
the
rest
marks
of
the
sort
that
merely
made
humps
under
clothing
the
object
that
hazen
was
carrying
was
the
mark
tickler
gusterson
had
seen
fay
wearing
yesterday
gusterson
was
sure
it
was
because
of
its
air
of
command
and
because
he
would
have
sworn
on
a
mountain
of
bibles
that
he
recognized
the
red
fleck
lurking
in
the
back
of
its
single
eye
and
alone
had
the
aura
of
full
conscious
thought
alone
had
mana
it
is
not
good
to
see
an
evil
legless
child
robot
with
dangling
straps
bossing
apparently
by
telepathic
power
not
only
three
objects
of
its
own
kind
and
five
close
primitive
relatives
but
also
eight
human
beings
and
in
addition
throwing
into
a
state
of
twitching
terror
one
miserable
director
pointed
a
claw
at
fay
fay
handlers
dragged
him
forward
still
resisting
but
more
feebly
now
as
if
or
at
least
cowed
gusterson
grunted
an
outraged
hey
and
automatically
struggled
a
bit
but
once
more
the
gun
dug
in
daisy
shut
her
eyes
then
firmed
her
mouth
and
opened
them
again
to
look
seating
the
tickler
on
fay
shoulder
took
a
little
time
because
two
blunt
spikes
in
its
bottom
had
to
be
fitted
into
the
valved
holes
in
the
plastic
disk
when
at
last
they
plunged
home
gusterson
felt
very
sick
indeed
and
then
even
more
so
as
the
tickler
itself
poked
a
tiny
pellet
on
a
fine
wire
into
fay
ear
the
next
moment
fay
had
straightened
up
and
motioned
his
handlers
aside
he
tightened
the
straps
of
his
tickler
around
his
chest
and
under
his
armpits
he
held
out
a
hand
and
someone
gave
him
a
shoulderless
shirt
and
coat
he
slipped
into
them
smoothly
dexterously
using
its
little
claws
to
help
put
its
turret
and
body
through
the
neatly
hemmed
holes
the
small
storm
troop
looked
at
fay
with
deferential
expectation
he
held
still
for
a
moment
as
if
thinking
and
then
walked
over
to
gusterson
and
looked
him
in
the
face
and
again
held
still
fay
expression
was
jaunty
on
the
surface
agonized
underneath
gusterson
knew
that
he
was
thinking
at
all
but
only
listening
for
instructions
from
something
that
was
whispering
on
the
very
threshold
of
his
inner
ear
gussy
old
boy
fay
said
twitching
a
depthless
grin
i
be
very
much
obliged
if
you
answer
a
few
simple
questions
his
voice
was
hoarse
at
first
but
he
swallowed
twice
and
corrected
that
what
exactly
did
you
have
in
mind
when
you
invented
ticklers
what
exactly
are
they
supposed
to
be
why
you
miserable
gusterson
began
in
a
kind
of
confused
horror
then
got
hold
of
himself
and
said
curtly
they
were
supposed
to
be
mech
reminders
they
were
supposed
to
record
memoranda
and
fay
held
up
a
palm
and
shook
his
head
and
again
listened
for
a
space
then
that
how
ticklers
were
supposed
to
be
of
use
to
humans
he
said
i
do
mean
that
at
all
i
mean
how
ticklers
were
supposed
to
be
of
use
to
themselves
surely
you
had
some
notion
fay
wet
his
lips
if
it
any
help
he
added
keep
in
mind
that
it
not
fay
who
asking
this
question
but
gusterson
hesitated
he
had
the
feeling
that
every
one
of
the
eight
dual
beings
in
the
room
was
hanging
on
his
answer
and
that
something
was
boring
into
his
mind
and
turning
over
his
next
thoughts
and
peering
at
and
under
them
before
he
had
a
chance
to
scan
them
himself
eye
was
like
a
red
searchlight
go
on
fay
prompted
what
were
ticklers
supposed
to
be
for
themselves
nothin
gusterson
said
softly
nothin
at
all
he
could
feel
the
disappointment
well
up
in
the
room
and
with
it
a
touch
of
something
like
panic
this
time
fay
listened
for
quite
a
long
while
i
hope
you
do
mean
that
gussy
he
said
at
last
very
earnestly
i
mean
i
hope
you
hunt
deep
and
find
some
ideas
you
forgot
or
maybe
never
realized
you
had
at
the
time
let
me
put
it
to
you
differently
what
the
place
of
ticklers
in
the
natural
scheme
of
things
what
their
aim
in
life
their
special
reason
their
genius
their
final
cause
what
gods
should
ticklers
worship
but
gusterson
was
already
shaking
his
head
he
said
i
do
know
anything
about
that
at
all
fay
sighed
and
gave
simultaneously
with
the
shrug
then
the
man
briskened
himself
i
guess
as
far
as
we
can
get
right
now
he
said
keep
thinking
gussy
try
to
remember
something
you
wo
be
able
to
leave
your
apartment
setting
guards
if
you
want
to
see
me
tell
them
or
just
think
in
due
course
you
be
questioned
further
in
any
case
perhaps
by
special
methods
perhaps
you
be
ticklerized
that
all
come
on
everybody
let
get
going
the
pimply
woman
and
her
pal
let
go
of
gusterson
daisy
man
loosed
his
decorous
hold
davidson
and
kester
sidled
away
with
an
eye
behind
them
and
the
little
storm
troop
trudged
out
fay
looked
back
in
the
doorway
i
sorry
gussy
he
said
and
for
a
moment
his
old
self
looked
out
of
his
eyes
i
wish
i
could
a
claw
reached
for
his
ear
a
spasm
of
pain
crossed
his
face
he
stiffened
and
marched
off
the
door
shut
gusterson
took
two
deep
breaths
that
were
close
to
angry
sobs
then
still
breathing
stentorously
he
stamped
into
the
bedroom
what
daisy
asked
looking
after
him
he
came
back
carrying
his
and
headed
for
the
door
what
are
you
up
to
she
demanded
knowing
very
well
i
going
to
blast
that
iron
monkey
off
fay
back
if
it
the
last
thing
i
do
she
threw
her
arms
around
him
now
lem
me
go
gusterson
growled
i
got
ta
be
a
man
one
time
anyway
as
they
struggled
for
the
gun
the
door
opened
noiselessly
davidson
slipped
in
and
deftly
snatched
the
weapon
out
of
their
hands
before
they
realized
he
was
there
he
said
nothing
only
smiled
at
them
and
shook
his
head
in
sad
reproof
as
he
went
out
gusterson
slumped
i
they
were
all
psionic
he
said
softly
i
just
got
out
of
control
now
that
last
look
fay
gave
us
he
touched
daisy
arm
thanks
kid
he
walked
to
the
glass
wall
and
looked
out
desultorily
after
a
while
he
turned
and
said
maybe
you
better
be
with
the
kids
hey
i
imagine
the
guards
let
you
through
daisy
shook
her
head
the
kids
never
come
home
until
supper
for
the
next
few
hours
they
be
safer
without
me
gusterson
nodded
vaguely
sat
down
on
the
couch
and
propped
his
chin
on
the
base
of
his
palm
after
a
while
his
brow
smoothed
and
daisy
knew
that
the
wheels
had
started
to
turn
inside
and
the
electrons
to
jump
around
except
that
she
reminded
herself
to
permanently
cross
out
those
particular
figures
of
speech
from
her
vocabulary
after
about
half
an
hour
gusterson
said
softly
i
think
the
ticklers
are
so
psionic
that
it
as
if
they
just
had
one
mind
if
i
were
with
them
very
long
i
start
to
be
part
of
that
mind
say
something
to
one
of
them
and
you
say
it
to
all
fifteen
minutes
later
they
not
crazy
they
just
newborn
the
ones
that
were
creating
a
cootching
chaos
downstairs
were
like
babies
kickin
their
legs
and
wavin
their
eyes
tryin
to
see
what
their
bodies
could
do
too
bad
their
bodies
are
us
ten
minutes
more
i
got
ta
do
something
about
it
fay
right
all
my
fault
he
just
the
apprentice
i
the
old
sorcerer
himself
five
minutes
more
gloomily
maybe
it
man
destiny
to
build
live
machines
and
then
bow
out
of
the
cosmic
picture
except
the
ticklers
need
us
dammit
just
like
nomads
need
horses
another
five
minutes
maybe
somebody
could
dream
up
a
purpose
in
life
for
ticklers
even
a
religion
the
first
church
of
tickler
but
i
hate
selling
other
people
spiritual
ideas
and
that
still
leave
ticklers
parasitic
on
humans
as
he
murmured
those
last
words
gusterson
eyes
got
wide
as
a
maniac
and
a
big
smile
reached
for
his
ears
he
stood
up
and
faced
himself
toward
the
door
what
are
you
intending
to
do
now
daisy
asked
flatly
i
merely
goin
out
an
save
the
world
he
told
her
i
may
be
back
for
supper
and
i
may
not
viii
davidson
pushed
out
from
the
wall
against
which
he
been
resting
himself
and
his
tickler
and
moved
to
block
the
hall
but
gusterson
simply
walked
up
to
him
he
shook
his
hand
warmly
and
looked
his
tickler
full
in
the
eye
and
said
in
a
ringing
voice
ticklers
should
have
bodies
of
their
own
he
paused
and
then
added
casually
come
on
let
visit
your
boss
davidson
listened
for
instructions
and
then
nodded
but
he
watched
gusterson
warily
as
they
walked
down
the
hall
in
the
elevator
gusterson
repeated
his
message
to
the
second
guard
who
turned
out
to
be
the
pimply
woman
now
wearing
shoes
this
time
he
added
ticklers
should
be
tied
to
the
frail
bodies
of
humans
which
need
a
lot
of
thoughtful
supervision
and
and
ca
even
fly
crossing
the
park
gusterson
stopped
a
soldier
and
informed
him
ticklers
got
ta
cut
the
apron
string
and
snap
the
silver
cord
and
go
out
in
the
universe
and
find
their
own
purposes
davidson
and
the
pimply
woman
did
interfere
they
merely
waited
and
watched
and
then
led
gusterson
on
on
the
escaladder
he
told
someone
it
cruel
to
tie
ticklers
to
snaily
humans
when
ticklers
can
think
and
live
ten
thousand
times
as
fast
he
finished
plucking
the
figure
from
the
murk
of
his
unconscious
by
the
time
they
got
to
the
bottom
the
message
had
become
ticklers
should
have
a
planet
of
their
own
they
never
did
catch
up
with
fay
although
they
spent
two
hours
skimming
around
on
slidewalks
under
the
subterranean
stars
pursuing
rumors
of
his
presence
clearly
the
boss
tickler
which
was
how
they
thought
of
led
an
energetic
life
gusterson
continued
to
deliver
his
message
to
all
and
sundry
at
intervals
toward
the
end
he
found
himself
doing
it
in
a
dreamy
and
forgetful
way
his
mind
he
decided
was
becoming
assimilated
to
the
communal
telepathic
mind
of
the
ticklers
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
at
the
time
after
two
hours
gusterson
realized
that
he
and
his
guides
were
becoming
part
of
a
general
movement
of
people
a
flow
as
mindless
as
that
of
blood
corpuscles
through
the
veins
yet
at
the
same
time
dimly
purposeful
at
least
there
was
the
feeling
that
it
was
at
the
behest
of
a
mind
far
above
the
flow
was
topside
all
the
slidewalks
seemed
to
lead
to
the
concourses
and
the
escaladders
gusterson
found
himself
part
of
a
human
stream
moving
into
the
tickler
factory
adjacent
to
his
apartment
or
another
factory
very
much
like
it
thereafter
gusterson
awarenesses
were
dimmed
it
was
as
if
a
bigger
mind
were
doing
the
remembering
for
him
and
it
were
permissible
and
even
mandatory
for
him
to
dream
his
way
along
he
knew
vaguely
that
days
were
passing
he
knew
he
had
work
of
a
sort
at
one
time
he
was
bringing
food
to
humans
working
feverishly
in
a
production
line
human
hands
and
tickler
claws
working
together
in
a
blur
of
rapidity
on
silvery
mechanisms
that
moved
along
jumpily
on
a
great
belt
at
another
he
was
sweeping
piles
of
metal
scraps
and
garbage
down
a
gray
corridor
two
scenes
stood
out
a
little
more
vividly
a
windowless
wall
had
been
knocked
out
for
twenty
feet
there
was
blue
sky
outside
its
light
almost
hurtful
and
a
drop
of
many
stories
a
file
of
humans
were
being
processed
when
one
of
them
got
to
the
head
of
the
file
his
or
her
tickler
was
ceremoniously
unstrapped
from
his
shoulder
and
welded
onto
a
silvery
cask
with
smoothly
pointed
ends
the
result
was
something
that
looked
at
least
in
the
case
of
the
mark
ticklers
like
a
stubby
silver
submarine
child
size
it
would
hum
gently
lift
off
the
floor
and
then
fly
slowly
out
through
the
big
blue
gap
then
the
next
human
would
step
forward
for
processing
the
second
scene
was
in
a
park
the
sky
again
blue
but
big
and
high
with
an
argosy
of
white
clouds
gusterson
was
lined
up
in
a
crowd
of
humans
that
stretched
as
far
as
he
could
see
row
on
irregular
row
martial
music
was
playing
overhead
hovered
a
flock
of
little
silver
submarines
lined
up
rather
more
orderly
in
the
air
than
the
humans
were
on
the
ground
the
music
rose
to
a
climax
the
tickler
nearest
gusterson
gave
as
if
to
say
and
now
who
knows
a
shrug
that
stung
his
memory
then
the
ticklers
took
off
straight
up
on
their
new
and
shining
bodies
they
became
a
flight
of
silver
geese
of
silver
midges
and
the
humans
around
gusterson
lifted
a
ragged
cheer
that
scene
marked
the
beginning
of
the
return
of
gusterson
mind
and
memory
he
shuffled
around
for
a
bit
spoke
vaguely
to
three
or
four
people
he
recalled
from
the
dream
days
and
then
headed
for
home
and
supper
three
weeks
late
and
as
disoriented
and
emaciated
as
a
bear
coming
out
of
hibernation
six
months
later
fay
was
having
dinner
with
daisy
and
gusterson
the
cocktails
had
been
poured
and
the
children
were
playing
in
the
next
apartment
the
transparent
violet
walls
brightened
then
gloomed
as
the
sun
dipped
below
the
horizon
gusterson
said
i
see
where
a
spaceship
out
beyond
the
orbit
of
mars
was
holed
by
a
tickler
i
wonder
where
the
little
guys
are
headed
now
fay
started
to
give
a
writhing
shrug
but
stopped
himself
with
a
grimace
maybe
out
of
the
solar
system
altogether
suggested
daisy
recently
dyed
her
hair
red
and
was
wearing
red
leotards
they
got
a
weary
trip
ahead
of
them
gusterson
said
unless
they
work
out
a
drive
on
the
way
fay
grimaced
again
he
was
still
looking
rather
peaked
he
said
plaintively
have
we
heard
enough
about
ticklers
for
a
while
i
guess
so
gusterson
agreed
but
i
get
to
wondering
about
the
little
guys
they
were
so
serious
and
intense
about
everything
i
never
did
solve
their
problem
you
know
i
just
shifted
it
onto
other
shoulders
than
ours
no
joke
intended
he
hurried
to
add
fay
forbore
to
comment
by
the
way
gussy
he
said
have
you
heard
anything
from
the
red
cross
about
that
medal
i
nominated
you
for
i
know
you
think
the
whole
concept
of
medals
is
ridiculous
especially
when
they
started
giving
them
to
all
heads
of
state
who
did
start
atomic
wars
while
in
office
but
nary
a
peep
gusterson
told
him
i
not
proud
fay
i
could
use
a
few
medals
i
start
a
flurry
in
the
market
but
i
do
worry
about
those
things
i
do
have
time
to
i
busy
these
days
thinkin
up
a
bunch
of
new
inventions
gussy
fay
said
sharply
his
face
tightening
in
alarm
have
you
forgotten
your
promise
not
fay
my
new
inventions
are
for
micro
or
any
other
firm
they
just
a
legitimate
part
of
my
literary
endeavors
happens
my
next
insanity
novel
is
goin
to
be
about
a
mad
inventor
fritz
leiber

grab
a
ticket
to
ecstasy
ecstacy
and
every
hundredth
time
it
says
them
out
loud
and
the
tickler
gives
give
so
it
can
spot
and
follow
him
around
then
the
target
postmen

topside
mail

scanning
and

they
to
use
that
archaic
archiac

yours

a
missing
genuine
orgy

you
no
heart

demanded
but
gusterson
gunderson
was
already
shaking
his
head
joined
shrug
just
like
nomads
need
horses
