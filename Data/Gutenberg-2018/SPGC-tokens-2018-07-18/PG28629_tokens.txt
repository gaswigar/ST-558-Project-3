chapter
i
the
pastor
progress
miss
phoebe
tozer
the
only
daughter
of
the
chief
deacon
and
leading
member
of
the
dissenting
connection
in
carlingford
married
shortly
after
his
appointment
to
the
charge
of
salem
chapel
in
that
town
the
reverend
beecham
one
of
the
most
rising
young
men
in
the
denomination
the
marriage
was
in
many
ways
satisfactory
to
the
young
lady
family
for
beecham
was
himself
the
son
of
respectable
people
in
a
good
way
of
business
and
not
destitute
of
means
and
the
position
was
one
which
they
had
always
felt
most
suitable
for
their
daughter
and
to
which
she
had
been
almost
it
may
be
said
brought
up
it
is
however
scarcely
necessary
to
add
that
it
was
not
quite
so
agreeable
to
the
other
leading
members
of
the
congregation
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
say
that
each
family
wished
that
preferment
for
its
own
favourite
daughter
for
indeed
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
pigeon
asserted
vigorously
that
a
substantial
grocer
whose
father
before
him
had
established
an
excellent
business
and
who
had
paid
for
his
pew
in
salem
as
long
as
any
one
could
recollect
and
supported
every
charity
and
paid
up
on
all
occasions
when
extra
expense
was
necessary
was
in
every
way
a
more
desirable
than
a
poor
minister
who
was
always
dependent
on
pleasing
the
chapel
folks
and
might
have
to
turn
out
any
day
notwithstanding
however
the
evident
superiority
of
the
establishment
thus
attained
by
maria
pigeon
there
is
a
certain
something
attached
to
the
position
of
a
clerical
caste
even
among
such
an
independent
body
as
the
congregation
at
salem
chapel
which
has
its
own
especial
charms
and
neither
the
young
people
who
had
been
her
companions
nor
the
old
people
who
had
patronized
and
snubbed
her
felt
any
satisfaction
in
seeing
phoebe
thus
advanced
over
them
to
the
honours
and
glories
inalienable
from
the
position
of
minister
wife
all
her
little
airs
of
bridal
vanity
were
considered
as
so
many
offensive
manifestations
of
delight
and
exultation
in
her
rise
in
life
her
though
pronounced
by
all
competent
judges
not
half
so
abundant
or
fine
as
maria
pigeon
still
called
forth
comments
which
nobody
ventured
to
indulge
in
in
respect
to
the
grocer
blooming
bride
a
grocer
lady
has
a
right
to
anything
her
parents
can
afford
but
to
see
a
minister
wife
swelling
herself
up
and
trying
to
ape
the
quality
filled
the
town
with
virtuous
indignation
the
sight
of
young
beecham
walking
about
with
her
in
her
hand
calling
on
the
miss
hemmingses
shaking
hands
with
rider
the
doctor
wife
caused
unmitigated
disgust
throughout
all
the
back
streets
of
carlingford
and
phoebe
in
as
if
the
chapel
belonged
to
her
was
almost
more
than
the
oldest
sitter
could
bear
phoebe
it
must
be
added
felt
her
elevation
to
the
full
and
did
not
spare
her
congregation
sometimes
she
would
have
the
audacity
to
walk
from
the
vestry
to
the
pew
as
if
she
were
an
instead
of
coming
in
humbly
by
the
door
as
became
a
woman
she
would
sit
still
ostentatiously
until
every
one
had
gone
waiting
for
her
husband
she
quite
led
the
singing
everybody
remarked
paying
no
more
attention
to
the
choir
than
if
it
did
not
exist
and
once
she
had
even
paused
on
her
way
to
her
seat
and
turned
down
the
gas
which
was
blazing
too
high
with
an
air
of
proprietorship
that
nobody
could
endure
does
salem
belong
to
them
tozers
i
should
like
to
know
said
brown
brown
would
never
be
outdone
by
him
in
subscriptions
you
may
be
sure
nor
pigeon
neither
if
the
truth
was
known
i
never
gave
my
money
to
build
a
castle
for
the
tozers
thus
the
whole
congregation
expressed
itself
with
more
or
less
eloquence
and
though
the
attendance
never
diminished
everybody
being
too
anxious
to
see
what
they
would
do
next
the
feeling
could
not
be
ignored
phoebe
herself
with
a
courage
which
developed
from
the
moment
of
her
marriage
took
the
initiative
it
never
answers
she
said
solemnly
to
marry
one
of
the
flock
i
knew
it
henery
and
i
told
you
so
and
if
you
would
be
so
infatuated
and
marry
me
when
i
told
you
not
for
your
own
interests
they
all
jealous
of
you
my
pet
that
what
it
is
said
beecham
and
laughed
he
could
bear
the
annoyance
in
consideration
of
that
sweet
consciousness
of
its
cause
which
stole
over
all
his
being
phoebe
laughed
too
but
not
with
so
delicious
a
gratification
she
felt
that
there
were
people
even
in
salem
who
might
be
jealous
of
him
the
end
of
it
all
is
we
must
not
stay
here
she
said
you
must
find
another
sphere
for
your
talents
henery
and
i
sure
it
will
not
be
difficult
if
you
get
put
on
that
deputation
that
is
going
down
to
the
north
suppose
you
take
a
few
of
your
best
sermons
dear
that
can
never
do
any
harm
indeed
it
sure
to
do
good
to
some
poor
benighted
soul
at
least
that
perhaps
never
heard
the
truth
before
and
likewise
perhaps
to
some
vacant
congregation
i
have
always
heard
that
chapels
in
the
north
were
very
superior
to
here
a
different
class
of
society
and
better
altogether
these
pigeons
and
browns
and
people
are
not
the
sort
of
society
for
you
well
there
truth
in
that
said
beecham
pulling
up
his
certainly
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
one
was
accustomed
to
and
he
lent
a
serious
ear
to
the
suggestion
about
the
sermons
the
consequence
was
that
an
invitation
followed
from
a
chapel
in
the
north
where
indeed
phoebe
found
herself
in
much
finer
society
and
grew
rapidly
in
importance
and
in
ideas
after
this
favourable
start
the
process
went
on
for
many
years
by
which
a
young
man
from
homerton
was
then
developed
into
the
influential
and
highly
esteemed
pastor
of
an
important
flock
things
may
be
and
probably
are
differently
managed
beecham
had
unbounded
fluency
and
an
unctuous
manner
of
treating
his
subjects
it
was
eloquence
of
a
kind
though
not
of
an
elevated
kind
never
to
be
at
a
loss
for
what
you
have
to
say
is
a
prodigious
advantage
to
all
men
in
all
positions
but
doubly
so
to
a
popular
minister
he
had
an
unbounded
wealth
of
phraseology
sentences
seemed
to
melt
out
of
his
mouth
without
any
apparent
effort
all
set
in
a
certain
cadence
he
had
not
perhaps
much
power
of
thought
but
it
is
easy
to
make
up
for
such
a
secondary
want
when
the
gift
of
expression
is
so
strong
beecham
rose
like
an
actor
from
a
long
and
successful
career
in
the
provinces
to
what
might
be
called
the
surrey
side
of
congregational
eminence
in
london
and
from
thence
attained
his
final
apotheosis
in
a
handsome
chapel
near
regent
park
built
of
the
whitest
stone
and
cushioned
with
the
reddest
damask
where
a
very
large
congregation
sat
in
great
comfort
and
listened
to
his
sermons
with
a
satisfaction
no
doubt
increased
by
the
fact
that
the
cushions
were
soft
as
their
own
and
that
carpets
and
pipes
kept
everything
snug
under
foot
it
was
the
most
comfortable
chapel
in
the
whole
connection
the
seats
were
arranged
like
those
of
an
amphitheatre
each
line
on
a
slightly
higher
level
than
the
one
in
front
of
it
so
that
everybody
saw
everything
that
was
going
on
no
dimness
or
mystery
was
wanted
there
everything
was
bright
daylight
bright
paint
red
cushions
comfort
and
respectability
it
might
not
be
a
place
very
well
adapted
for
saying
your
prayers
in
but
then
you
could
say
your
prayers
at
home
and
it
was
a
place
admirably
adapted
for
hearing
sermons
in
which
you
could
not
do
at
home
and
all
the
arrangements
were
such
that
you
could
hear
in
the
greatest
comfort
not
to
say
luxury
i
wonder
for
my
own
part
that
the
poor
folk
about
did
not
seize
upon
the
crescent
chapel
on
the
cold
sunday
mornings
and
make
themselves
happy
in
those
warm
and
ruddy
pews
it
would
be
a
little
amusing
to
speculate
what
all
the
would
have
done
had
this
unexpected
answer
to
the
appeal
which
beecham
believed
himself
to
make
every
sunday
to
the
world
in
general
been
literally
given
it
would
have
been
extremely
embarrassing
to
the
managing
committee
and
all
the
and
would
have
i
fear
deeply
exasperated
and
offended
the
occupants
of
those
family
pews
but
fortunately
this
difficulty
never
did
occur
the
proletariat
of
marylebone
had
not
the
sense
or
the
courage
or
the
profanity
which
you
will
to
hit
upon
this
mode
of
warming
themselves
the
real
congregation
embraced
none
of
the
unwashed
multitude
its
value
in
mere
velvet
silk
lace
trinkets
and
furs
was
something
amazing
and
the
amount
these
comfortable
people
represented
in
the
way
of
income
would
have
amounted
to
a
most
princely
revenue
the
little
salems
and
bethesdas
with
their
humble
flocks
could
not
be
supposed
to
belong
to
the
same
species
and
the
difference
was
almost
equally
marked
between
such
a
place
of
worship
as
the
crescent
chapel
and
the
parish
churches
which
are
like
the
nets
in
the
gospel
and
take
in
all
kinds
of
fish
bad
and
good
the
in
the
crescent
chapel
were
universally
well
off
they
subscribed
liberally
to
missionary
societies
far
more
liberally
than
the
people
in
paul
close
by
did
to
the
they
had
everything
of
the
best
in
the
chapel
as
they
had
in
their
houses
they
no
more
economized
on
their
minister
than
they
did
on
their
and
they
spent
an
amount
of
money
on
their
choir
which
made
the
at
paul
gnash
their
teeth
from
all
this
it
will
be
seen
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
crescent
chapel
was
of
a
very
distinct
and
individual
kind
it
was
a
warm
luxurious
air
perfumy
breathing
of
that
refinement
which
is
possible
to
mere
wealth
i
do
not
say
there
might
not
be
true
refinement
besides
but
the
surface
kind
that
which
you
buy
from
upholsterers
and
tailors
and
dressmakers
which
you
procure
ready
made
at
schools
and
which
can
only
be
kept
up
at
a
very
high
cost
abounded
and
pervaded
the
place
badly
dressed
people
felt
themselves
out
of
place
in
that
brilliant
sanctuary
a
muddy
footprint
upon
the
thick
matting
in
the
passages
was
looked
at
as
a
crime
clean
dry
feet
issuing
out
of
carriage
or
cab
kept
the
aisles
unstained
even
on
the
wettest
day
we
say
cab
because
many
of
the
people
who
went
to
the
crescent
chapel
objected
to
take
out
their
own
carriages
or
work
their
own
horses
on
sunday
and
there
were
many
more
who
though
they
did
not
possess
carriages
used
cabs
with
a
freedom
incompatible
with
poverty
as
a
general
rule
they
were
much
better
off
than
the
people
at
paul
more
universally
prosperous
and
and
they
were
at
the
same
time
what
you
might
safely
call
people
people
who
read
the
newspapers
and
sometimes
the
magazines
and
knew
what
was
going
on
the
men
were
almost
all
liberal
in
politics
and
believed
in
gladstone
with
enthusiasm
the
women
often
took
an
interest
in
public
movements
especially
of
a
charitable
character
there
was
less
mental
stagnation
among
them
probably
than
among
many
of
their
neighbours
their
life
was
not
profound
nor
high
but
still
it
was
life
after
a
sort
such
was
the
flock
which
had
invited
beecham
to
become
their
pastor
when
he
reached
the
climax
of
his
career
they
gave
him
a
very
good
salary
enough
to
enable
him
to
have
a
handsome
house
in
one
of
the
terraces
overlooking
regent
park
it
is
not
a
fashionable
quarter
but
it
is
not
to
be
despised
in
any
way
the
rooms
were
and
lofty
and
sometimes
have
been
known
to
suffice
for
very
fine
people
indeed
a
fact
which
the
beechams
were
well
aware
of
and
they
were
not
above
the
amiable
weakness
of
making
it
known
that
their
house
was
in
a
line
with
that
of
lady
cecilia
burleigh
this
single
fact
of
itself
might
suffice
to
mark
the
incalculable
distance
between
the
reverend
beecham
of
the
crescent
chapel
and
the
young
man
who
began
life
as
minister
of
salem
in
carlingford
and
the
development
outside
was
not
less
remarkable
than
the
development
within
it
is
astonishing
how
our
prejudices
change
from
youth
to
middle
age
even
without
any
remarkable
interposition
of
fortune
i
do
not
say
dissipate
or
even
dispel
which
is
much
more
doubtful
but
they
change
when
and
beecham
commenced
life
they
had
both
the
warmest
feeling
of
opposition
to
the
church
and
everything
churchy
all
the
circumstances
of
their
lives
had
encouraged
this
feeling
the
dislike
of
the
little
for
the
great
the
instinctive
opposition
of
a
lower
class
towards
the
higher
intensified
that
natural
essence
of
separatism
that
determination
to
be
wiser
than
one
neighbour
which
in
the
common
mind
lies
at
the
bottom
of
all
dissent
in
saying
this
we
no
more
accuse
dissenters
in
religion
than
dissenters
in
politics
or
in
art
or
in
criticism
the
first
dissenter
in
most
cases
is
an
original
thinker
to
whom
his
enforced
departure
from
the
ways
of
his
fathers
is
misery
and
pain
generally
he
has
a
hard
struggle
with
himself
before
he
can
give
up
for
the
superlative
truth
which
has
taken
possession
of
him
all
the
habits
the
pious
traditions
of
his
life
he
is
the
real
nonconformist
half
martyr
half
victim
of
his
convictions
but
that
nonconformity
which
has
come
to
be
the
faith
in
which
a
large
number
of
people
are
trained
is
a
totally
different
business
and
affects
a
very
different
kind
of
sentiments
personal
and
independent
conviction
has
no
more
to
do
with
it
than
it
has
to
do
with
the
ardour
of
a
breton
peasant
trained
in
deepest
zeal
of
romanism
or
the
unbounded
certainty
of
any
other
traditionary
believer
for
this
reason
we
may
be
allowed
to
discuss
the
changes
of
feeling
which
manifested
themselves
in
and
beecham
without
anything
disrespectful
to
nonconformity
not
being
persons
of
original
mind
they
were
what
their
training
and
circumstances
and
a
flood
of
natural
influences
made
them
they
began
life
feeling
themselves
to
be
of
a
hopelessly
low
social
caste
and
believing
themselves
to
be
superior
to
their
superiors
in
that
enlightenment
which
they
had
been
brought
up
to
believe
distinguished
the
connection
the
first
thing
which
opened
their
minds
to
a
dawning
doubt
whether
their
enlightenment
was
in
reality
so
much
greater
than
that
of
their
neighbours
was
the
social
change
worked
in
their
position
by
their
removal
from
carlingford
in
the
great
towns
of
the
north
dissent
attains
its
highest
social
elevation
and
chapel
people
are
no
longer
to
be
distinguished
from
church
people
except
by
the
fact
that
they
go
to
chapel
instead
of
church
a
definition
so
simple
as
to
be
quite
overwhelming
to
the
unprepared
dissenting
intelligence
brought
up
in
a
little
tory
borough
still
holding
for
church
and
queen
the
amazing
difference
which
this
made
in
the
sentiments
of
phoebe
beecham
tozer
it
is
quite
impossible
to
describe
her
sudden
introduction
to
circles
which
pigeon
had
never
entered
and
to
houses
at
the
of
which
brown
the
dairyman
would
have
humbly
waited
would
have
turned
the
young
woman
head
had
she
not
felt
the
overpowering
necessity
of
keeping
that
organ
as
steady
as
possible
to
help
her
to
hold
her
position
in
the
new
world
phoebe
was
a
girl
of
spirit
and
though
her
head
went
round
and
round
and
everything
felt
confused
about
her
she
did
manage
desperately
to
hold
her
own
and
to
avoid
committing
herself
but
i
can
not
attempt
to
tell
how
much
her
social
elevation
modified
her
sectarian
zeal
phoebe
was
only
a
woman
so
that
i
am
free
to
assign
such
motives
as
having
a
serious
power
over
her
let
us
hope
beecham
being
a
man
and
a
pastor
was
moved
in
a
more
lofty
intellectual
and
spiritual
way
but
however
that
may
be
the
pair
went
conjugally
together
in
this
modification
of
sentiment
and
by
the
time
they
reached
the
lofty
eminence
of
the
crescent
chapel
were
as
nonconformists
as
heart
could
desire
beecham
indeed
had
many
friends
in
the
low
and
even
some
in
the
broad
church
he
appeared
on
platforms
to
promote
various
public
movements
along
with
clergymen
of
the
church
he
spoke
of
our
brethren
within
the
pale
of
the
establishment
always
with
respect
sometimes
even
with
enthusiasm
depend
upon
it
my
dear
sir
he
would
even
say
sometimes
to
a
liberal
brother
the
establishment
is
not
such
an
unmitigated
evil
as
some
people
consider
it
what
should
we
do
in
country
parishes
where
the
people
are
not
awakened
they
do
the
dirty
work
for
us
my
dear
brother
the
dirty
work
these
sentiments
were
shared
but
perhaps
not
warmly
by
beecham
congregation
some
of
whom
were
hot
voluntaries
and
gave
their
ministers
a
little
trouble
but
the
most
part
took
their
nonconformity
very
quietly
and
were
satisfied
to
know
that
their
chapel
was
the
first
in
the
connection
and
their
minister
justly
esteemed
as
one
of
the
most
eloquent
the
liberation
society
held
one
meeting
at
the
crescent
chapel
but
it
was
not
considered
a
great
success
at
the
best
they
were
no
more
than
lukewarm
not
political
dissenters
both
minister
and
people
were
liberal
that
was
the
creed
they
professed
some
of
the
congregations
citywards
and
the
smaller
chapels
about
hampstead
and
islington
used
the
word
latitudinarian
instead
but
that
as
the
crescent
chapel
people
said
was
a
word
always
applied
by
the
bigoted
and
ignorant
to
those
who
held
in
high
regard
the
doctrines
of
christian
charity
they
were
indeed
somewhat
proud
of
their
tolerance
their
impartiality
their
freedom
from
old
prejudices
that
sort
of
thing
will
not
do
said
copperhead
who
was
a
great
railway
contractor
and
one
of
the
deacons
and
who
had
himself
a
son
at
oxford
if
there
had
been
any
bigotry
in
the
crescent
copperhead
would
have
had
little
difficulty
in
transferring
himself
over
the
way
to
church
and
it
is
astonishing
what
an
effect
that
fact
had
upon
the
mind
of
beecham
flock
beecham
house
was
situated
in
regent
park
and
was
constructed
on
the
ordinary
model
of
such
houses
on
the
was
a
handsome
a
room
which
both
and
beecham
twenty
years
before
would
have
considered
splendid
but
which
now
they
condescended
to
as
not
so
large
as
they
could
wish
but
still
comfortable
the
above
was
larger
a
bright
and
pleasant
room
furnished
with
considerable
taste
behind
the
a
smaller
room
was
beecham
study
or
the
library
as
it
was
sometimes
called
it
was
lined
with
containing
a
very
fair
collection
of
books
and
ornamented
with
portraits
chiefly
engravings
of
celebrated
ministers
and
laymen
in
the
connection
with
a
bust
of
copperhead
over
the
mantelpiece
this
bust
had
been
done
by
a
young
sculptor
whom
he
patronized
for
the
great
man
own
house
when
it
was
nearly
completed
however
a
flaw
was
found
in
the
marble
which
somewhat
detracted
from
its
perfection
the
flaw
was
in
the
shoulder
of
the
image
and
by
no
means
serious
but
copperhead
was
not
the
man
to
pass
over
any
such
defect
after
a
long
and
serious
consultation
over
it
which
made
the
young
artist
shake
in
his
shoes
a
solution
was
found
for
the
difficulty
tell
you
what
sir
said
copperhead
i
give
it
to
the
minister
it
look
famous
in
his
little
study
works
of
art
often
come
his
way
and
you
get
a
block
of
the
best
chipstone
the
very
best
sir
no
expense
spared
and
begin
another
for
me
this
arrangement
was
perfectly
satisfactory
to
all
parties
though
i
will
not
say
that
it
was
not
instrumental
in
bringing
about
certain
other
combinations
which
will
be
fully
discussed
in
this
history
the
beechams
were
mightily
surprised
when
the
huge
marble
head
almost
as
large
as
a
jupiter
though
perhaps
not
otherwise
so
imposing
arrived
at
the
terrace
but
they
were
also
gratified
it
is
quite
like
receiving
us
into
his
own
family
circle
beecham
said
with
a
glance
at
her
daughter
phoebe
junior
who
with
all
her
pink
fingers
outspread
was
standing
in
adoration
before
that
image
of
wealth
and
fabulous
luxury
what
a
grand
head
it
is
cried
the
young
enthusiast
gazing
rapt
upon
the
complacent
marble
whisker
so
delightfully
curled
and
bristling
with
realistic
force
it
looks
well
i
must
say
it
looks
well
said
beecham
himself
rubbing
his
hands
to
receive
such
a
token
of
respect
from
the
leading
member
of
the
flock
and
certainly
no
more
perfect
representation
of
a
ever
adorned
any
shepherd
sanctuary
chapter
ii
the
leading
member
copperhead
to
whom
so
much
allusion
has
been
made
was
a
man
in
other
regions
besides
that
of
the
crescent
chapel
his
name
indeed
may
be
said
to
have
gone
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
from
whence
he
had
conducted
lines
of
railway
and
where
he
had
left
docks
bridges
and
to
make
him
illustrious
he
was
one
of
the
greatest
contractors
for
railways
and
other
public
works
in
england
and
by
consequence
in
the
world
he
had
no
more
than
a
very
ordinary
education
and
no
manners
to
speak
of
but
at
the
same
time
he
had
that
kind
of
faculty
which
is
in
practical
work
what
genius
is
in
literature
and
indeed
in
its
kind
is
genius
too
though
it
neither
refines
nor
even
oddly
enough
enlarges
the
mind
to
which
it
belongs
he
saw
the
right
track
for
a
road
through
a
country
with
a
glance
of
his
eye
he
mastered
all
the
points
of
nature
which
were
opposed
to
him
in
the
rapidest
survey
though
scientifically
he
was
great
in
no
branch
of
knowledge
he
could
rule
his
men
as
easily
as
if
they
were
so
many
children
and
indeed
they
were
children
in
his
hands
all
these
gifts
made
it
apparent
that
he
must
have
been
a
remarkable
and
able
man
but
no
stranger
would
have
guessed
as
much
from
his
appearance
or
his
talk
there
were
people
indeed
who
knew
him
well
and
who
remained
incredulous
and
bewildered
trying
to
persuade
themselves
that
his
success
must
be
owing
to
pure
luck
for
that
he
had
nothing
else
to
secure
it
the
cause
of
this
perhaps
was
that
he
knew
nothing
about
books
and
was
one
of
those
jeering
cynics
who
are
so
common
under
one
guise
or
another
fine
cynics
are
endurable
and
give
a
certain
zest
often
to
society
which
might
become
too
civil
without
them
but
your
coarse
cynic
is
not
pleasant
copperhead
eye
was
as
effectual
in
quenching
emotion
of
any
but
the
coarsest
kind
as
water
is
against
fire
people
might
be
angry
in
his
presence
it
was
the
only
passion
he
comprehended
but
tenderness
sympathy
sorrow
all
the
more
generous
sentiments
fled
and
concealed
themselves
when
this
large
rich
costly
man
came
by
people
who
were
brought
much
in
contact
with
him
became
ashamed
of
having
any
feelings
at
all
his
eye
upon
them
seemed
to
convict
them
of
humbug
those
eyes
were
very
light
grey
prominent
with
a
jeer
in
them
which
was
a
very
powerful
moral
instrument
his
own
belief
was
that
he
could
spot
humbug
wherever
he
saw
it
and
that
nothing
could
escape
him
and
i
suppose
so
much
humbug
is
there
in
this
world
that
his
belief
was
justified
but
there
are
few
more
awful
people
than
those
ignoble
spectators
whose
jeer
arrests
the
moisture
in
the
eye
and
strangles
the
outcry
on
their
neighbour
lip
copperhead
had
risen
from
the
ranks
yet
not
altogether
from
the
ranks
his
father
before
him
had
been
a
contractor
dealing
chiefly
with
canals
and
roads
and
the
old
kind
of
public
works
a
very
rough
personage
indeed
but
one
to
whose
fingers
gold
had
stuck
perhaps
because
of
the
clay
with
which
they
were
always
more
or
less
smeared
this
ancestor
had
made
a
beginning
to
the
family
and
given
his
son
a
name
to
start
with
copperhead
had
married
young
and
had
several
sons
who
were
all
in
business
and
all
doing
well
less
vigorous
but
still
moderately
successful
copies
of
their
father
when
however
he
had
thus
done
his
duty
to
the
state
the
first
copperhead
having
died
he
did
the
only
incomprehensible
action
of
his
life
he
married
a
second
time
a
feeble
pretty
little
woman
who
had
been
his
daughter
governess
married
her
without
rhyme
or
reason
as
all
his
friends
and
connections
said
the
only
feasible
motive
for
this
second
union
seemed
to
be
a
desire
on
part
to
have
something
belonging
to
him
which
he
could
always
jeer
at
and
in
this
way
the
match
was
highly
successful
copperhead
the
second
was
gushing
and
susceptible
and
as
good
a
butt
as
could
be
imagined
she
kept
him
in
practice
when
nobody
else
was
at
hand
she
was
one
of
those
naturally
refined
but
less
than
timid
creatures
who
are
to
be
found
now
and
then
painfully
earning
the
bread
which
is
very
bitter
to
them
in
richer
people
houses
and
preserving
in
their
little
silent
souls
some
fetish
in
the
shape
of
a
scrap
of
gentility
which
is
their
sole
comfort
or
almost
their
sole
comfort
copperhead
fetish
was
the
dear
recollection
that
she
was
an
officer
daughter
or
rather
this
had
been
her
fetish
in
the
days
when
she
had
nothing
and
was
free
to
plume
herself
on
the
reflected
glory
whether
in
the
depths
of
her
luxurious
abode
at
the
height
of
her
good
fortune
she
still
found
comfort
in
the
thought
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
everybody
who
had
known
her
in
her
youth
thought
her
the
most
fortunate
of
women
her
old
school
companions
told
her
story
for
the
encouragement
of
their
daughters
as
they
might
have
told
a
fairy
tale
to
see
her
rolling
in
her
gorgeous
carriage
or
bowed
out
of
a
shop
where
all
the
daintiest
devices
of
fashion
had
been
placed
at
her
feet
filled
with
awe
and
envy
she
could
buy
whatever
she
liked
festoon
herself
with
finery
surround
herself
with
the
costliest
the
more
there
were
of
them
and
the
costlier
they
were
the
better
was
copperhead
pleased
she
had
everything
that
heart
could
desire
poor
little
woman
what
a
change
from
the
who
was
snubbed
by
her
pupil
and
neglected
by
everybody
and
yet
i
am
not
sure
that
she
did
not
so
inconsistent
is
human
nature
look
back
to
those
melancholy
days
with
a
sigh
this
lady
was
the
mother
of
clarence
copperhead
the
young
man
who
was
at
oxford
her
only
child
upon
whom
of
course
she
doted
with
the
fondest
folly
and
whom
his
father
jeered
at
more
than
at
any
one
else
in
the
world
more
even
than
at
his
mother
yet
was
prouder
of
than
of
all
his
other
sons
and
all
his
possessions
put
together
clarence
whom
i
will
not
describe
as
he
will
i
trust
show
himself
more
effectually
by
his
actions
was
like
his
mother
in
disposition
or
so
at
least
she
made
herself
happy
by
thinking
but
by
some
freak
of
nature
he
was
like
his
father
in
person
and
carried
his
mouse
heart
in
a
huge
frame
somewhat
hulking
and
with
the
same
roll
which
distinguished
copperhead
and
which
betrayed
something
of
the
original
navvy
who
was
the
root
of
the
race
he
had
his
father
large
face
too
and
a
tendency
towards
those
demonstrative
and
offensive
whiskers
which
are
the
special
inheritance
of
the
british
philistine
but
instead
of
the
large
goggle
eyes
always
jeering
and
impudent
which
lighted
up
the
paternal
countenance
clarence
had
a
pair
of
mild
brown
orbs
repeated
from
his
mother
faded
face
which
introduced
the
oddest
discord
into
his
physiognomy
generally
in
the
family
that
is
to
say
among
the
and
who
formed
first
family
the
young
fellow
bore
no
other
name
than
that
of
the
curled
darling
though
indeed
he
was
as
far
from
being
curled
as
any
one
could
be
he
was
not
clever
he
had
none
of
the
energy
of
his
race
and
promised
to
be
as
useless
in
an
office
as
he
would
have
been
in
a
cutting
or
a
yard
full
of
men
i
am
not
sure
that
this
fact
did
not
increase
secretly
his
father
exultation
and
pride
in
him
copperhead
was
fond
of
costly
and
useless
things
he
liked
them
for
their
cost
with
an
additional
zest
in
his
sense
of
the
huge
vulgar
use
and
profit
of
most
things
in
his
own
life
this
tendency
more
than
any
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
made
him
what
is
called
a
patron
of
art
it
swelled
his
personal
importance
to
think
that
he
was
able
to
hang
up
thousands
of
pounds
so
to
speak
on
his
walls
knowing
all
the
time
that
he
could
make
thousands
more
by
the
money
had
he
invested
it
in
more
useful
ways
the
very
fact
that
he
could
afford
to
refrain
from
investing
it
that
he
could
let
it
lie
there
useless
hanging
by
so
many
cords
and
ribbons
was
sweet
to
him
and
so
also
it
was
sweet
to
him
to
possess
a
perfectly
useless
specimen
of
humanity
which
had
cost
him
a
great
deal
and
promised
to
cost
him
still
more
he
had
plenty
of
useful
sons
as
he
had
of
useful
money
the
one
who
was
of
no
use
was
the
apex
and
glory
of
the
whole
but
these
three
made
up
a
strange
enough
family
party
as
may
be
supposed
the
original
copperheads
the
first
family
who
were
all
of
the
same
class
and
nature
would
have
made
a
much
noisier
less
peaceable
household
but
they
would
have
been
a
much
jollier
and
really
more
harmonious
one
copperhead
himself
somewhat
despised
his
elder
sons
who
were
like
himself
only
less
rich
less
vigorous
and
less
he
saw
oddly
enough
the
coarseness
of
their
manners
and
even
of
their
ways
of
thinking
but
yet
he
was
a
great
deal
more
comfortable
more
at
his
ease
among
them
than
he
was
when
seated
opposite
his
trembling
deprecating
frightened
little
wife
or
that
huge
youth
who
cost
him
so
much
and
returned
him
so
little
now
and
then
at
regular
periodical
intervals
the
head
of
the
family
would
go
down
to
blackheath
to
dine
and
spend
the
night
with
his
son
joe
the
second
and
the
favourite
where
there
were
romping
children
and
a
portly
rosy
young
matron
and
loud
talk
about
city
dinners
contracts
and
estimates
this
refreshed
him
and
he
came
home
with
many
chuckles
over
the
imperfections
of
the
family
my
sons
buy
their
wives
by
the
he
would
say
jocularly
at
breakfast
the
day
after
thirteen
stone
if
she
is
a
pound
is
joe
expensive
to
keep
up
in
velvet
and
satin
not
to
speak
of
mutton
and
beef
your
mother
comes
cheap
he
would
add
aside
to
clarence
with
a
rolling
laugh
thus
he
did
not
in
the
least
exempt
his
descendants
from
the
universal
ridicule
which
he
poured
on
all
the
world
but
when
he
sat
down
opposite
his
timid
little
delicate
wife
and
by
his
university
man
who
had
very
little
on
the
whole
to
say
for
himself
copperhead
felt
the
increase
in
gentility
as
well
as
the
failure
in
jollity
you
are
a
couple
of
ghosts
after
joe
and
his
belongings
you
two
speak
louder
i
say
young
fellow
you
do
expect
me
to
hear
that
of
yours
he
would
say
chuckling
at
them
with
a
mixture
of
pride
and
disdain
they
amused
him
by
their
dulness
and
silence
and
personal
awe
of
him
he
was
quite
out
of
his
element
between
these
two
and
yet
the
very
fact
pleasantly
excited
his
pride
i
speak
as
gentlemen
generally
speak
said
clarence
who
was
sometimes
sullen
when
attacked
and
who
knew
by
experience
that
his
father
was
rarely
offended
by
such
an
argument
and
i
am
sure
dear
your
papa
would
never
wish
you
to
do
otherwise
said
anxious
copperhead
casting
a
furtive
frightened
glance
at
her
husband
he
rolled
out
a
mighty
laugh
from
the
head
of
the
table
where
he
was
sitting
he
contemplated
them
with
a
leer
that
would
have
been
insulting
had
he
not
been
the
husband
of
one
and
the
father
of
the
other
the
laugh
and
the
look
called
forth
some
colour
on
copperhead
cheek
well
as
she
was
used
to
them
but
her
son
was
less
susceptible
and
ate
his
breakfast
steadily
and
did
not
care
a
pretty
pair
you
are
said
copperhead
i
like
your
gentility
how
much
would
you
eat
for
breakfast
i
wonder
my
lad
if
you
had
to
work
for
it
luckily
for
you
i
was
brought
up
to
talk
as
you
say
like
a
gentleman
i
like
to
see
you
managing
a
field
of
navvies
with
that
nice
little
voice
of
yours
ay
or
a
mob
before
the
hustings
my
boy
you
good
for
nothing
you
are
a
nice
delicate
piece
of
china
for
a
cupboard
like
your
mother
before
you
however
thank
heaven
we
got
the
cupboard
he
said
with
a
laugh
looking
round
him
a
nice
big
too
well
painted
and
gilded
and
the
time
has
come
through
not
talking
like
a
gentleman
that
i
can
afford
you
you
should
hear
joe
when
that
fellow
talks
his
house
shakes
confounded
bad
style
of
house
walls
like
gingerbread
how
the
boards
do
break
like
under
joe
fairy
foot
i
ca
make
out
by
jove
one
would
think
i
starved
you
to
see
you
beside
your
always
had
a
fine
healthy
appetite
had
mrs
joe
there
was
nothing
to
answer
to
this
speech
and
therefore
a
dead
silence
ensued
when
the
master
of
the
house
is
so
distinctly
the
master
silence
is
apt
to
ensue
after
his
remarks
copperhead
sipped
her
tea
and
clarence
worked
steadily
through
his
breakfast
and
the
head
of
the
family
crumpled
the
times
which
he
read
at
intervals
all
sorts
of
jokes
had
gone
on
at
joe
table
the
morning
before
and
there
had
been
peals
of
laughter
and
joe
had
even
administered
a
slap
upon
her
husband
ruddy
cheek
for
some
pleasantry
or
other
copperhead
as
he
looked
at
his
son
and
his
wife
chuckled
behind
the
times
when
they
thought
he
was
occupied
they
made
a
few
gentle
remarks
to
each
other
they
had
soft
voices
with
that
indescribable
resemblance
in
tone
which
so
often
exists
between
mother
and
son
dresden
china
yes
that
was
the
word
and
to
see
his
own
resemblance
made
in
that
delicate
and
elevated
into
that
region
of
superlative
costliness
tickled
copperhead
and
in
the
most
delightful
way
how
about
your
ball
was
his
next
question
or
clarence
ball
as
you
do
seem
to
take
much
interest
in
it
you
are
afraid
of
being
brought
in
contact
with
the
iron
pots
eh
you
might
crack
or
go
to
pieces
who
knows
and
what
would
become
of
me
a
wretched
widower
copperhead
himself
laughed
loudly
at
this
joke
which
did
not
excite
any
mirth
from
the
others
and
then
he
repeated
his
question
how
about
the
ball
the
invitations
are
all
sent
out
copperhead
i
i
mean
a
hundred
and
i
i
beg
your
pardon
they
were
in
two
lots
answered
the
poor
woman
nervously
a
hundred
and
and
there
is
a
few
more
take
your
time
take
your
time
we
get
at
the
truth
at
last
said
her
husband
and
he
laid
down
his
paper
and
looked
at
her
he
was
not
angry
nor
impatient
the
twinkle
in
his
eye
was
purely
humorous
her
stumblings
amused
him
and
her
nervousness
but
oddly
enough
the
most
furious
impatience
could
not
have
more
deeply
disconcerted
her
there
are
a
few
more
some
old
friends
of
mine
she
went
on
confused
they
were
once
rather
kind
took
an
interest
that
is
oh
the
baronet
and
his
daughters
said
copperhead
by
all
means
let
have
the
baronet
and
his
daughters
though
as
for
their
taking
an
interest
if
you
had
not
been
a
rich
man
wife
living
in
a
grand
house
in
portland
place
it
was
not
now
she
said
hurriedly
i
do
not
suppose
that
any
one
takes
an
interest
in
me
now
copperhead
laughed
and
nodded
his
head
not
many
i
should
think
not
many
you
women
must
make
up
your
minds
to
that
it
all
very
well
to
take
an
interest
in
a
pretty
girl
but
when
you
come
to
a
certain
age
well
let
proceed
the
baronet
and
his
two
girls
ah
there
two
girls
that
for
you
clarence
my
boy
i
thought
there
must
be
a
motive
think
that
fellow
a
good
eh
and
i
would
not
say
they
were
far
wrong
if
he
behaves
himself
make
a
note
of
the
baronet
daughter
young
man
lord
what
a
world
it
is
said
copperhead
reflectively
i
should
not
wonder
if
you
had
been
scheming
too
i
would
not
for
the
world
cried
the
poor
little
woman
roused
for
once
i
would
not
for
anything
interfere
with
a
marriage
that
is
the
last
thing
you
need
fear
from
me
whether
it
was
a
girl
i
was
fond
of
or
a
girl
i
disliked
so
long
as
she
was
clarence
choice
oh
i
know
the
harm
that
is
done
by
other
people
meddling
nothing
nothing
would
induce
me
to
interfere
copperhead
laid
down
his
paper
and
looked
at
her
i
suppose
however
little
a
man
may
care
for
his
wife
he
does
not
relish
the
idea
that
she
married
him
for
anything
but
love
he
contemplated
her
still
with
amused
ridicule
but
with
something
fiercer
in
his
eyes
oh
h
he
said
you
do
like
other
people
to
interfere
not
so
much
as
to
say
it
a
capital
match
eh
you
get
so
and
so
and
so
and
so
that
you
could
have
otherwise
carriages
perhaps
and
plenty
of
money
in
your
pocket
which
it
may
be
you
never
had
in
your
life
before
and
consideration
and
one
of
the
finest
houses
in
london
let
us
say
in
portland
place
you
do
like
that
amount
of
good
advice
eh
well
i
do
i
mean
to
interfere
with
my
son
to
that
extent
at
least
you
can
do
what
you
like
but
as
you
a
person
of
prodigious
influence
and
strong
will
and
a
great
deal
of
character
and
all
that
copperhead
broke
out
with
a
rude
laugh
i
afraid
of
you
i
am
quite
afraid
fortunately
just
at
this
moment
his
brougham
came
round
and
the
great
man
finished
his
coffee
at
a
gulp
and
got
up
you
look
out
for
the
baronet
daughters
then
he
said
and
see
all
ready
for
this
ball
of
yours
while
i
go
and
work
to
pay
the
bills
that
my
share
you
do
the
ornamental
and
i
do
the
useful
ha
ha
i
keep
up
my
share
it
was
astonishing
what
a
difference
came
upon
the
room
the
moment
he
disappeared
somehow
it
had
been
out
of
harmony
his
voice
his
look
his
heavy
person
even
his
whiskers
had
been
out
of
character
now
the
air
seemed
to
flutter
after
the
closing
of
the
door
like
water
into
which
something
offensive
has
sunk
and
when
the
ripples
of
movement
were
over
the
large
handsome
room
had
toned
down
into
perfect
accord
with
its
remaining
inhabitants
copperhead
eyes
were
rather
red
not
with
tears
but
with
the
inclination
to
shed
tears
which
she
carefully
restrained
in
her
son
presence
he
still
continued
to
eat
steadily
he
had
an
admirable
appetite
but
when
he
had
finished
everything
on
his
plate
he
looked
up
and
said
i
hope
you
do
mind
mamma
i
do
suppose
you
do
but
i
do
like
the
way
my
father
speaks
to
you
oh
my
dear
cried
the
mother
with
an
affected
little
smile
why
should
i
mind
i
ought
to
know
by
this
time
that
it
only
your
way
i
suppose
so
but
i
do
like
it
said
the
young
man
decisively
he
did
not
notice
however
as
after
second
thoughts
he
returned
to
the
that
his
mother
eyes
were
redder
than
ever
chapter
iii
copperhead
ball
this
ball
was
an
event
not
only
in
copperhead
household
but
even
in
the
connection
itself
to
which
the
idea
of
balls
as
given
by
leading
members
of
the
flock
was
somewhat
novel
not
that
the
young
people
were
debarred
from
that
amusement
but
it
was
generally
attained
in
a
more
or
less
accidental
manner
and
few
professing
christians
connected
with
the
management
of
the
chapel
had
gone
the
length
of
giving
such
an
entertainment
openly
and
with
design
copperhead
however
was
in
a
position
to
triumph
over
all
such
prejudices
he
was
so
rich
that
any
community
would
have
felt
it
ought
to
extend
a
certain
measure
of
indulgence
to
such
a
man
very
wealthy
persons
are
like
spoilt
children
their
caprices
are
allowed
to
be
natural
and
even
when
we
are
angry
with
them
we
excuse
the
vagaries
to
which
money
has
a
right
this
feeling
of
indulgence
goes
a
very
great
way
especially
among
the
classes
engaged
in
who
generally
recognize
a
man
right
to
spend
and
feel
the
sweetness
of
spending
more
acutely
than
the
hereditary
possessors
of
wealth
i
do
not
believe
that
his
superior
knowledge
of
the
best
ways
of
using
money
profitably
ever
hinders
a
man
from
lavish
expenditure
but
it
gives
him
a
double
zest
in
spending
and
it
makes
him
generally
charitable
towards
the
extravagances
of
persons
still
richer
than
himself
a
ball
there
was
no
doubt
was
a
entertainment
but
still
the
chapel
reflected
it
is
almost
impossible
not
to
be
a
little
when
you
possess
such
a
great
share
of
the
world
goods
and
that
of
course
it
could
not
be
for
himself
that
copperhead
was
doing
this
but
for
his
son
his
son
these
amiable
casuists
proceeded
was
being
brought
up
to
fill
a
great
position
and
no
doubt
society
did
exact
something
and
as
copperhead
had
asked
all
the
chief
chapel
people
his
ball
was
looked
upon
with
very
indulgent
eyes
the
fact
that
the
minister
and
his
family
were
going
staggered
some
of
the
more
particular
members
a
little
but
beecham
took
high
ground
on
the
subject
and
silenced
the
flock
the
fact
that
a
minister
of
religion
is
one
of
the
first
persons
invited
is
sufficient
proof
of
the
way
our
friend
means
to
manage
everything
said
the
pastor
depend
upon
it
it
would
be
good
for
the
social
relations
of
the
country
if
your
pastors
and
teachers
were
always
present
it
gives
at
once
a
character
to
all
the
proceedings
this
like
every
other
lofty
assertion
stilled
the
multitude
some
of
the
elder
ladies
indeed
groaned
to
hear
even
at
the
a
whisper
between
the
girls
about
this
ball
and
what
they
were
going
to
wear
but
still
it
was
christmas
and
all
the
newspapers
and
a
good
deal
of
the
light
literature
which
is
especially
current
at
that
season
persistently
represented
all
the
world
as
in
a
state
of
imbecile
joviality
and
thus
for
the
moment
every
objection
was
put
down
to
nobody
however
was
the
question
what
to
wear
more
interesting
than
to
phoebe
junior
who
was
a
very
young
woman
and
even
on
the
point
of
dress
had
theories
of
her
own
phoebe
had
as
her
parents
were
happy
to
think
had
every
advantage
in
her
education
she
had
possessed
a
german
governess
all
to
herself
by
which
means
even
beecham
himself
supposed
a
certain
amount
of
that
philosophy
which
germans
communicate
by
their
very
touch
must
have
got
into
her
besides
her
music
and
the
language
which
was
her
primary
study
and
she
had
attended
lectures
at
the
ladies
college
close
by
and
heard
a
great
many
eminent
men
on
a
great
many
different
subjects
she
had
read
too
a
great
deal
she
was
very
well
got
up
in
the
subject
of
education
for
women
and
lamented
often
and
pathetically
the
difficulty
they
lay
under
of
acquiring
the
highest
instruction
but
at
the
same
time
she
patronized
ruskin
theory
that
dancing
drawing
and
cooking
were
three
of
the
higher
arts
which
ought
to
be
studied
by
girls
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
account
for
the
discrepancies
between
those
two
systems
in
the
first
place
because
i
can
not
and
in
the
second
place
because
there
is
in
the
mind
of
the
age
some
ineffable
way
of
harmonizing
them
which
makes
their
conjunction
common
phoebe
was
restrained
from
carrying
out
either
to
its
full
extent
she
was
not
allowed
to
go
in
for
the
cambridge
examinations
because
beecham
felt
the
connection
might
think
it
strange
to
see
his
daughter
name
in
the
papers
and
probably
would
imagine
he
meant
to
make
a
schoolmistress
of
her
which
he
thanked
providence
he
had
no
need
to
do
and
she
was
not
allowed
to
educate
herself
in
the
department
of
cooking
to
which
beecham
objected
saying
likewise
thank
heaven
they
had
no
need
of
such
messings
that
she
did
not
wish
her
daughter
to
make
a
slave
of
herself
and
that
cook
would
not
put
up
with
it
between
these
two
limits
phoebe
noble
ambition
was
confined
which
was
a
trial
to
her
but
she
did
what
she
could
bating
neither
heart
nor
hope
she
read
virgil
at
least
if
not
sophocles
and
she
danced
and
dressed
though
she
was
not
allowed
to
cook
as
she
took
the
matter
in
this
serious
way
it
will
be
understood
that
the
question
of
dress
was
not
a
mere
frivolity
with
her
a
week
before
the
ball
she
stood
in
front
of
the
large
glass
in
her
mother
room
contemplating
herself
not
with
that
satisfaction
which
it
is
generally
supposed
a
pretty
young
woman
has
in
contemplating
her
own
image
she
was
decidedly
a
pretty
young
woman
she
had
a
great
deal
of
the
hair
of
the
period
nature
in
her
case
as
curiously
yet
very
truly
in
so
many
others
having
lent
herself
to
the
prevailing
fashion
how
it
comes
about
i
can
not
tell
but
it
is
certain
that
there
does
exist
at
this
present
moment
a
proportion
of
girls
which
very
much
exceeds
the
number
we
used
to
see
when
golden
hair
had
not
become
fashionable
a
freak
of
nature
which
is
altogether
independent
of
dyes
and
auriferous
fluid
and
which
probably
has
influenced
fashion
unawares
to
be
sure
the
pomades
of
twenty
years
ago
are
heaven
be
praised
unknown
to
this
generation
and
washing
also
has
become
the
fashion
which
accounts
for
something
anyhow
phoebe
junior
possessed
in
perfection
the
hair
of
the
period
she
had
too
the
complexion
which
goes
naturally
with
those
sunny
locks
a
warm
pink
and
white
which
had
the
boundaries
between
the
pink
and
the
white
been
a
little
more
distinct
would
have
approached
perfection
too
this
was
what
she
was
thinking
when
she
looked
at
herself
in
her
mother
great
glass
beecham
stood
behind
her
more
and
more
than
she
but
very
evidently
the
rose
to
which
this
bud
would
come
in
time
phoebe
looked
at
her
own
reflection
and
then
at
her
mother
and
sighed
such
a
profound
sigh
as
only
lungs
in
the
most
excellent
condition
could
produce
mamma
she
said
with
an
accent
of
despair
i
am
too
pink
a
great
deal
too
pink
what
am
i
to
do
nonsense
my
pet
said
beecham
you
have
a
lovely
complexion
and
she
threw
a
quantity
of
green
ribbons
which
lay
by
over
her
hair
and
shoulders
a
cloud
crossed
the
blooming
countenance
of
phoebe
junior
she
disembarrassed
herself
of
the
ribbons
with
another
sigh
dear
mamma
she
said
i
wish
you
would
let
me
read
with
you
now
and
then
about
the
theory
of
colours
for
instance
green
is
the
complementary
of
red
if
you
want
to
bring
out
my
pink
and
make
it
more
conspicuous
than
ever
of
course
you
will
put
me
in
a
green
dress
no
mamma
dear
not
that
i
should
look
a
fright
and
though
i
dare
say
it
does
not
matter
much
i
object
to
looking
a
fright
women
are
i
suppose
more
ornamental
than
men
or
at
least
everybody
says
so
and
in
that
case
it
is
our
duty
to
keep
it
up
you
are
a
funny
girl
with
your
theories
of
colour
said
beecham
in
my
time
fair
girls
wore
greens
and
blues
and
dark
girls
wore
reds
and
yellows
it
was
quite
simple
have
a
white
tarlatan
then
every
girl
looks
well
in
that
you
do
see
mamma
said
phoebe
softly
suppressing
in
the
most
admirable
manner
the
delicate
trouble
of
not
being
understood
that
a
thing
every
girl
looks
well
in
is
just
the
sort
of
thing
that
no
one
looks
well
in
white
shows
no
invention
it
is
as
if
one
took
no
trouble
about
one
dress
and
neither
one
ought
phoebe
said
her
mother
that
is
very
true
it
is
sinful
to
waste
time
thinking
of
colours
and
ribbons
when
we
might
be
occupied
about
much
more
important
matters
that
is
not
my
opinion
at
all
said
phoebe
i
should
like
people
to
think
i
had
taken
a
great
deal
of
trouble
think
of
all
the
trouble
that
has
to
be
taken
to
get
up
this
ball
i
fear
so
indeed
and
a
great
deal
of
expense
said
beecham
shaking
her
head
yes
when
one
comes
to
think
of
that
but
then
you
see
wealth
has
its
duties
i
do
defend
copperhead
i
do
think
he
wants
to
be
defended
mamma
i
think
it
is
all
nonsense
about
wasting
time
what
i
incline
to
if
you
wo
be
shocked
is
black
black
the
suggestion
took
away
beecham
breath
as
if
you
were
fifty
why
i
do
consider
myself
old
enough
for
black
it
is
a
pity
said
phoebe
with
a
glance
at
her
mother
full
colours
but
that
was
really
of
so
much
less
importance
black
would
throw
me
up
she
added
seriously
turning
to
the
glass
it
would
take
off
this
pink
look
i
do
mind
it
in
the
cheeks
but
i
am
pink
all
over
my
white
is
pink
black
would
be
a
great
deal
the
best
for
both
of
us
it
would
tone
us
down
said
phoebe
decisively
and
it
would
throw
us
up
but
for
you
a
girl
under
twenty
my
dear
mamma
what
does
it
matter
the
question
is
am
i
to
look
my
best
which
i
think
is
my
duty
to
you
and
to
providence
or
am
i
just
said
phoebe
with
indignation
to
look
a
little
insipidity
a
creature
with
no
character
a
little
girl
like
everybody
else
the
consequence
of
this
solemn
appeal
was
that
both
the
phoebes
went
to
copperhead
ball
in
black
the
elder
in
velvet
with
honiton
lace
point
which
phoebe
with
her
artistic
instincts
would
have
much
preferred
being
unattainable
the
younger
in
tulle
flounced
to
distraction
and
largely
relieved
with
blue
and
the
consequence
of
this
toilette
and
of
the
fact
that
phoebe
did
her
duty
by
her
parents
and
by
providence
and
looked
her
very
best
was
that
clarence
copperhead
fell
a
hopeless
victim
to
her
fascinations
and
scarcely
could
be
induced
to
leave
her
side
all
night
the
ball
was
about
as
remarkable
a
ball
as
could
have
been
seen
in
london
the
son
of
the
house
had
contemplated
with
absolute
despair
the
list
of
invitations
he
had
deprecated
the
entertainment
altogether
he
had
said
we
know
nobody
with
a
despairing
impertinence
which
called
forth
one
of
his
father
roars
of
laughter
and
though
copperhead
had
done
all
he
could
to
assume
the
position
of
that
typical
paterfamilias
who
is
condemned
to
pay
for
those
pleasures
of
his
family
which
are
no
pleasure
to
him
yet
was
too
much
for
him
and
everybody
felt
that
he
was
in
reality
the
giver
and
enjoyer
of
the
entertainment
it
was
not
copperhead
ball
it
was
the
first
of
the
kind
which
had
ever
taken
place
in
his
house
the
beginning
of
a
new
chapter
in
his
social
existence
up
to
this
moment
he
had
not
shown
any
signs
of
being
smitten
with
that
craze
for
society
which
so
often
and
so
sorely
affects
the
millionnaire
he
had
contented
himself
hitherto
with
heavy
and
showy
dinners
costing
heaven
knows
how
much
a
head
copperhead
knew
and
swelled
visibly
in
pride
and
pleasure
as
the
cost
increased
which
he
consumed
in
company
with
twenty
people
or
so
of
kindred
tastes
to
himself
who
appreciated
the
cost
and
understood
his
feelings
on
such
people
however
his
dresden
china
was
thrown
away
joe
and
joe
were
much
more
in
their
way
than
the
elegant
university
man
and
the
mother
who
was
a
poor
little
dowdy
they
all
said
therefore
the
fact
had
been
forced
upon
copperhead
that
his
circle
must
be
widened
and
advanced
if
his
crowning
glories
were
to
be
appreciated
as
they
deserved
the
hunger
of
wealth
for
that
something
above
wealth
which
the
bewildered
rich
man
only
discovers
the
existence
of
when
he
has
struggled
to
the
highest
pinnacle
of
advancement
in
his
own
way
began
to
seize
this
wealthy
neophyte
to
be
sure
in
this
first
essay
the
company
which
he
assembled
in
his
fine
rooms
in
portland
place
to
see
all
his
fine
things
and
celebrate
his
glory
was
not
a
fine
company
but
they
afforded
more
gratification
to
copperhead
than
if
they
had
been
ever
so
fine
they
were
people
of
his
own
class
his
old
friends
invited
to
be
dazzled
though
standing
out
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
and
refusing
so
far
as
in
them
lay
to
admit
how
much
dazzled
they
were
it
was
a
more
reasonable
sort
of
vanity
than
the
commoner
kind
which
aims
at
displaying
its
riches
to
great
personages
people
who
are
not
dazzled
by
any
extent
of
grandeur
and
in
whose
bosoms
no
jealousy
is
excited
towards
the
giver
of
the
feast
copperhead
friends
had
much
more
lively
feelings
they
walked
about
through
the
great
rooms
with
their
wives
on
their
arms
in
a
state
of
expressing
no
admiration
saying
to
each
other
this
must
have
cost
copperhead
a
pretty
penny
as
they
met
in
doorways
while
the
ladies
put
their
flowery
and
jewelled
heads
together
and
whispered
did
you
ever
see
such
extravagance
and
what
a
dowdy
is
with
it
all
this
was
the
of
sentiment
which
flowed
strong
in
all
the
passages
and
down
the
rapids
of
the
great
staircase
a
stream
of
vigorous
human
feeling
the
existence
of
which
was
as
deeply
gratifying
to
the
entertainer
as
the
sweetest
flattery
the
lord
and
the
ladies
who
might
have
been
tempted
to
his
great
house
would
not
have
had
a
thought
to
spare
for
copperhead
but
the
unwilling
applause
of
his
own
class
afforded
him
a
true
triumph
amid
this
throng
of
people
however
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
the
one
young
lady
who
attracted
his
son
was
the
least
eligible
person
there
being
no
other
than
phoebe
beecham
the
pastor
daughter
almost
the
only
other
utterly
ineligible
girl
was
a
pale
little
maiden
who
accompanied
sir
robert
dorset
and
his
daughters
and
who
was
supposed
to
be
either
their
governess
or
their
humble
companion
the
dorsets
were
the
only
people
who
had
any
pretensions
to
belong
to
society
in
all
those
crowded
rooms
they
were
distantly
related
to
copperhead
and
had
been
she
gratefully
thought
kind
to
her
in
her
youth
and
they
had
no
particular
objection
to
be
kind
to
her
now
that
she
was
rich
though
the
baronet
as
copperhead
always
called
him
winced
at
so
rampant
a
specimen
of
wealth
and
the
girls
did
not
see
what
good
it
was
to
keep
up
relations
with
a
distant
cousin
who
though
so
prodigiously
rich
was
of
no
possible
use
and
could
neither
make
parties
for
them
nor
chaperon
them
to
the
houses
of
the
great
when
they
had
received
her
present
invitation
they
had
accepted
it
with
surprise
and
hesitation
chance
only
had
brought
them
to
london
at
that
time
of
the
year
the
most
curious
time
surely
to
choose
for
a
ball
but
convenient
enough
as
affording
a
little
amusement
at
a
season
when
little
amusement
was
ordinarily
to
be
had
sir
robert
had
consented
to
go
as
a
man
with
no
occupation
elsewhere
might
consent
to
go
to
the
cannibal
islands
to
see
how
the
savages
comported
themselves
and
little
ursula
may
another
poor
relative
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
whom
they
had
charitably
brought
up
to
town
with
them
might
go
too
they
decided
to
such
a
gathering
there
was
no
lady
dorset
and
the
girls
were
girls
only
by
courtesy
having
passed
the
age
to
which
that
title
refers
such
good
looks
as
they
had
were
faded
and
they
were
indifferently
dressed
this
last
circumstance
arose
partly
from
the
fact
that
they
never
dressed
very
well
and
partly
because
they
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
put
themselves
to
much
trouble
for
poor
copperhead
ball
their
little
companion
ursula
was
in
a
white
frock
the
sort
of
dress
which
phoebe
had
rebelled
against
she
was
all
white
and
had
never
been
to
a
ball
before
this
little
party
which
represented
the
aristocracy
at
the
copperhead
ball
went
to
the
entertainment
with
a
little
expectation
in
their
minds
what
sort
of
people
would
be
there
would
they
be
frights
they
were
not
likely
to
be
interesting
in
any
other
way
the
miss
dorsets
knew
but
to
little
ursula
a
ball
was
a
ball
and
meant
delight
and
glory
she
was
aware
though
she
did
not
quite
know
how
the
expectations
of
the
party
however
were
strangely
disappointed
instead
of
being
a
set
of
frights
copperhead
guests
were
found
to
be
resplendent
in
toilette
never
even
under
a
ducal
roof
had
these
ladies
found
themselves
in
such
a
gorgeous
assembly
and
never
before
perhaps
even
at
the
duchess
grandest
receptions
had
they
been
unable
to
discover
a
single
face
they
knew
sir
robert
was
even
more
appalled
by
this
discovery
than
his
daughters
were
he
put
up
his
glass
and
peered
more
and
more
wistfully
into
the
crowd
do
know
a
soul
he
repeated
at
intervals
poor
sir
robert
he
had
not
thought
it
possible
that
such
an
event
could
happen
to
him
within
the
four
seas
accordingly
the
dorsets
clung
somewhat
scared
to
copperhead
side
and
ursula
along
with
them
who
looked
at
the
crowd
still
more
wistfully
than
sir
robert
did
and
thought
how
nice
it
would
be
to
know
somebody
unfortunately
the
miss
dorsets
were
not
attractive
in
personal
appearance
clarence
copperhead
though
he
was
not
indifferent
to
a
baronet
was
yet
not
sufficiently
devoted
to
the
aristocracy
to
do
more
than
dance
once
as
was
his
bounden
duty
with
each
of
the
sisters
it
seems
so
strange
not
to
know
any
one
these
ladies
said
is
it
said
clarence
do
know
a
soul
but
then
he
went
off
and
danced
with
phoebe
beecham
and
the
miss
dorsets
stood
by
copperhead
almost
concealing
behind
them
the
slight
little
figure
of
little
ursula
may
clarence
was
a
very
young
man
on
the
whole
he
knew
his
duty
and
did
it
with
a
steady
industry
working
off
his
dances
in
the
spirit
of
his
navvy
forefather
but
he
returned
between
each
duty
dance
to
the
young
lady
in
black
who
was
always
distinguishable
among
so
many
young
ladies
in
white
and
pink
and
green
and
blue
the
miss
dorsets
and
ursula
looked
with
interest
and
something
like
envy
at
that
young
lady
in
black
she
had
so
many
partners
that
she
scarcely
knew
how
to
manage
them
all
and
the
son
of
the
house
returned
to
her
side
with
a
pertinacity
that
could
not
pass
unremarked
why
should
one
girl
have
so
much
and
another
girl
so
little
ursula
said
to
herself
but
to
be
sure
she
knew
nobody
and
the
young
lady
in
black
knew
everybody
on
the
whole
however
it
became
evident
to
ursula
that
a
ball
was
not
always
a
scene
of
unmixed
delight
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
remember
what
old
friends
we
are
said
phoebe
but
clarence
do
be
more
good
to
me
than
you
ought
to
be
i
see
your
mother
looking
for
you
and
copperhead
might
not
like
it
another
time
perhaps
we
shall
be
able
to
talk
of
old
days
there
is
no
time
like
the
present
said
the
young
man
who
liked
his
own
way
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
it
was
right
of
phoebe
to
dance
with
him
especially
dances
she
had
promised
to
other
people
but
he
was
the
personage
of
the
evening
and
that
is
a
great
temptation
copperhead
himself
came
up
to
them
more
than
once
with
meaning
in
his
eyes
do
be
too
entertaining
miss
phoebe
he
said
for
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
not
speak
plainly
in
his
own
house
especially
to
the
minister
daughter
do
be
too
entertaining
this
is
ball
and
he
ought
to
be
civil
to
other
people
too
oh
please
go
away
cried
phoebe
after
this
admonition
but
clarence
was
sullen
and
stood
his
ground
we
are
going
to
have
our
waltz
out
he
said
it
is
not
my
ball
a
bit
let
him
entertain
his
people
himself
how
should
i
know
such
a
set
of
guys
i
know
nobody
but
you
and
the
dorset
girls
who
are
in
society
parents
are
a
mistake
said
the
young
man
half
rebellious
half
sullen
they
never
understand
perhaps
you
do
feel
that
but
i
should
think
girls
must
see
it
sometimes
as
well
as
men
girls
do
use
such
strong
expressions
said
phoebe
smiling
as
they
flew
off
in
the
uncompleted
waltz
she
danced
very
well
better
than
most
of
the
ladies
present
and
that
was
the
reason
clarence
assigned
to
his
mother
for
his
preference
of
her
but
when
copperhead
saw
that
his
remonstrance
was
unheeded
by
the
young
people
he
went
up
to
beecham
with
a
rich
man
noble
frankness
and
courage
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
here
and
i
hope
you
have
remarked
how
well
miss
phoebe
is
entertaining
my
boy
do
you
see
them
dancing
she
been
away
from
you
a
long
time
beecham
as
girls
will
when
they
get
hold
of
somebody
that
pleases
them
should
you
like
me
to
go
and
fetch
her
back
beecham
with
cheeks
that
were
very
full
blown
indeed
and
required
a
great
deal
of
fanning
called
back
her
child
to
her
side
at
the
end
of
that
dance
she
scolded
phoebe
behind
her
fan
and
recalled
her
to
a
sense
of
duty
a
pastor
daughter
has
to
be
doubly
particular
she
said
what
if
your
poor
papa
was
to
get
into
trouble
through
your
thoughtlessness
i
was
not
thoughtless
mamma
forgive
me
for
answering
back
said
phoebe
very
meekly
and
she
showed
no
signs
of
sulkiness
though
clarence
was
carried
off
and
kept
from
approaching
her
again
unfortunately
however
when
clarence
was
removed
from
phoebe
he
fell
into
still
greater
peril
the
eldest
miss
dorset
and
her
mother
both
of
them
with
equally
benevolent
intentions
introduced
him
simultaneously
to
ursula
may
the
poor
little
girl
has
not
danced
once
copperhead
who
had
recollections
of
standing
by
herself
for
a
whole
evening
unnoticed
whispered
in
his
ear
and
miss
dorset
spoke
to
him
still
more
plainly
we
brought
her
she
said
but
i
can
not
get
her
partners
for
i
do
know
anybody
and
what
could
clarence
do
but
offer
himself
and
ursula
too
was
a
good
dancer
and
very
pretty
far
prettier
than
phoebe
confound
him
there
he
is
now
for
ever
with
that
girl
in
white
said
his
father
to
himself
with
great
rage
dozens
of
good
partners
in
pink
and
blue
were
going
about
the
room
what
did
the
boy
mean
by
bestowing
himself
upon
the
two
poor
ones
the
black
and
the
white
this
disturbed
copperhead
enjoyment
as
he
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
looking
round
upon
all
the
splendour
that
was
his
and
feeling
disposed
like
nebuchadnezzar
to
call
upon
everybody
to
come
and
worship
him
he
expanded
and
swelled
out
with
pride
and
complacency
as
he
looked
round
upon
his
own
greatness
and
perceived
the
effect
made
upon
the
beholders
when
that
effect
did
not
seem
sufficiently
deep
he
called
here
and
there
upon
a
lingerer
for
applause
that
considered
a
very
fine
turner
he
said
taking
one
of
them
into
a
smaller
room
come
along
here
you
know
about
that
sort
of
thing
i
do
i
should
be
ashamed
to
tell
you
how
much
i
gave
for
it
all
that
money
hanging
there
useless
bringing
in
nothing
but
when
i
do
buy
anything
i
like
it
to
be
the
very
best
that
is
to
be
had
i
as
soon
have
a
good
chromo
said
the
person
addressed
which
costs
a
matter
of
a
note
and
enough
too
to
hang
up
against
a
wall
but
you
can
afford
it
copperhead
you
the
best
right
of
any
man
i
know
to
be
a
fool
if
you
like
the
great
man
laughed
but
he
scarcely
liked
the
compliment
i
am
a
fool
if
you
like
he
said
the
biggest
fool
going
i
like
a
thing
that
costs
a
deal
and
is
of
no
use
that
what
i
call
luxury
my
boy
clarence
and
my
big
picture
they
dear
but
i
can
afford
if
they
were
double
the
price
if
i
were
you
said
his
friend
i
would
hang
my
picture
in
this
little
bit
of
a
hole
nor
let
my
boy
waste
his
time
with
all
the
in
the
room
there
smith
girl
and
robinson
niece
both
of
them
worth
a
cool
hundred
thousand
and
you
leave
him
to
flourish
about
all
over
the
place
with
a
chit
in
a
white
frock
and
another
in
a
black
one
i
call
that
waste
not
luxury
for
my
part
i
do
want
to
sell
either
the
boy
or
the
picture
said
the
rich
man
with
a
laugh
but
nevertheless
he
was
annoyed
that
his
son
should
be
such
an
ass
miss
smith
and
miss
robinson
were
as
fine
as
their
milliners
could
make
them
the
first
of
these
ladies
had
an
emerald
locket
almost
as
big
as
a
and
miss
robinson
pearls
were
a
little
fortune
in
themselves
but
the
chosen
objects
of
that
young
idiot
attentions
wore
nothing
but
trumpery
trinkets
and
gowns
which
had
been
made
at
home
for
all
copperhead
knew
confound
him
the
father
breathed
hotly
to
himself
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
unmixed
pleasure
is
not
to
be
had
in
this
world
even
in
the
midst
of
envious
friends
and
the
most
splendid
entertainment
which
money
could
supply
chapter
iv
a
country
party
very
funny
now
said
sir
robert
i
do
know
that
such
a
thing
ever
happened
to
me
before
give
you
my
word
for
it
i
did
know
a
single
soul
not
one
and
there
must
have
been
a
couple
of
hundred
or
so
there
jove
i
never
thought
there
were
as
many
people
in
england
that
i
know
how
could
you
know
copperhead
friends
said
sophy
dorset
what
i
wonder
is
that
she
should
have
asked
us
not
but
that
it
was
amusing
enough
once
in
a
way
just
to
see
how
such
people
look
they
looked
very
much
like
other
people
my
dear
finer
though
i
have
seen
so
many
jewels
at
an
evening
party
for
ages
very
much
like
other
people
fatter
perhaps
the
men
but
not
the
women
i
notice
said
sir
robert
who
himself
was
spare
that
city
men
generally
have
a
tendency
to
fat
they
are
so
rich
said
miss
dorset
with
gentle
disgust
she
was
the
quiet
one
never
saying
much
sophy
who
was
lively
conducted
the
conversation
they
were
all
seated
at
breakfast
later
than
usual
on
the
morning
after
the
copperheads
ball
it
was
a
hazy
morning
and
the
party
were
seated
in
a
large
in
the
very
central
locality
of
suffolk
street
looking
down
that
straight
little
street
upon
the
stream
of
carriages
and
omnibuses
in
the
foggy
distance
it
was
not
for
pleasure
that
this
country
party
had
come
to
london
sir
robert
second
son
who
was
in
india
had
sent
his
eldest
children
home
to
the
care
of
his
father
and
sisters
they
were
expected
at
portsmouth
daily
and
the
aunts
somewhat
excited
by
the
prospect
of
their
charge
had
insisted
upon
coming
to
town
to
receive
them
as
for
ursula
may
who
was
a
poor
relation
on
the
late
lady
dorset
side
as
copperhead
had
been
a
poor
relation
on
sir
robert
london
at
any
season
was
a
wonder
and
excitement
to
her
and
she
could
not
sufficiently
thank
the
kind
relations
who
had
given
her
this
holiday
in
her
humdrum
life
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
poor
clergyman
in
the
little
town
of
carlingford
a
widower
with
a
large
family
ursula
was
the
eldest
daughter
with
the
duties
of
a
mother
on
her
much
burdened
hands
and
she
had
no
special
inclination
towards
these
duties
so
that
a
week
escape
from
them
was
a
relief
to
her
at
any
time
and
a
ball
but
the
ball
had
not
been
so
beatific
as
ursula
hoped
in
her
dark
blue
serge
dress
close
up
to
the
throat
and
down
to
the
wrists
she
did
not
look
so
pale
as
she
had
done
in
her
garments
on
the
previous
night
but
she
was
at
the
best
of
times
a
shadowy
little
person
with
soft
dark
brown
hair
dark
brown
eyes
and
no
more
colour
than
the
faintest
of
wild
rose
tints
but
the
youthfulness
and
softness
and
roundness
of
the
girl
showed
to
full
advantage
beside
the
more
angular
development
of
the
miss
dorsets
who
were
tall
and
had
lost
the
first
smooth
curves
of
youth
to
ursula
not
yet
twenty
these
ladies
looked
very
mature
almost
aged
being
one
of
them
ten
and
the
other
eight
years
older
than
herself
she
looked
up
to
them
with
great
respect
but
she
felt
all
the
same
how
could
she
help
it
that
in
some
things
though
the
miss
dorsets
were
her
superiors
it
was
best
to
be
ursula
may
poor
clara
said
sir
robert
she
was
always
a
frightened
creature
when
i
recollect
her
a
poor
little
governess
keeping
behind
backs
at
the
nursery
parties
and
to
see
her
in
all
her
splendour
now
she
would
keep
behind
backs
still
if
she
could
said
miss
dorset
think
of
that
ursula
cried
sophy
there
is
an
example
for
you
she
was
a
great
deal
worse
off
than
you
are
and
to
see
her
now
as
papa
says
you
may
have
a
house
in
portland
place
too
and
ask
us
to
balls
and
wear
diamonds
think
of
that
though
last
night
you
looked
as
frightened
as
she
do
put
such
demoralizing
ideas
into
the
child
head
how
it
is
that
girls
are
not
ruined
said
miss
dorset
shaking
her
head
ruined
by
such
examples
i
can
not
tell
they
must
have
stronger
heads
than
we
think
as
poor
as
cinderella
one
day
and
the
next
as
rich
as
the
queen
without
any
merit
of
theirs
all
because
some
chance
man
happens
to
take
a
fancy
to
them
quite
right
said
sir
robert
quite
right
my
dear
it
is
the
natural
course
of
affairs
miss
dorset
shook
her
head
she
went
on
shaking
her
head
as
she
poured
out
the
tea
she
was
not
given
to
eloquence
but
the
subject
inspired
her
do
think
of
it
ursula
it
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
good
girls
ought
to
think
of
and
the
elder
sister
made
signs
to
sophy
who
was
reckless
and
did
not
mind
the
moral
effect
of
the
suggestion
poor
copperhead
i
shall
never
have
a
house
in
portland
place
nor
any
diamonds
except
aunt
mary
old
brooch
i
shall
live
and
die
an
old
maid
and
nobody
will
waste
a
thought
upon
me
said
sophy
who
made
this
prophecy
at
her
ease
not
expecting
it
to
come
true
but
i
envy
poor
clara
and
if
you
marry
such
a
man
as
copperhead
though
i
shall
admire
you
very
much
ursula
i
sha
envy
you
is
young
copperhead
as
bad
as
his
father
said
ursula
simply
she
was
so
far
from
thinking
what
meaning
could
be
attached
to
her
words
that
she
stopped
and
looked
wondering
from
one
to
another
when
they
laughed
ha
ha
ha
said
sir
robert
not
so
bad
either
poor
ursula
was
extremely
serious
she
turned
with
relief
to
miss
dorset
who
was
serious
too
my
dear
we
do
know
much
about
clarence
he
is
a
heavy
young
man
i
do
think
he
is
attractive
have
you
had
a
letter
from
the
parsonage
this
morning
said
anne
dorset
with
a
very
grave
face
and
as
it
turned
out
that
ursula
had
a
letter
miss
dorset
immediately
plunged
into
discussion
of
it
the
girl
did
not
understand
why
the
simple
little
epistle
should
be
so
interesting
nor
did
she
perceive
yet
what
the
laughter
was
about
to
tell
the
truth
ursula
who
was
not
clever
had
thought
young
copperhead
very
he
had
asked
her
to
dance
when
nobody
else
did
he
had
talked
to
her
as
much
as
he
could
have
talked
to
sophy
dorset
herself
he
had
rehabilitated
her
in
her
own
eyes
after
the
first
disappointment
and
failure
of
the
evening
and
she
was
prepared
to
think
whatever
might
be
said
about
the
father
that
the
son
was
very
kind
and
very
agreeable
why
should
they
laugh
ursula
concluded
that
there
must
be
some
private
joke
of
their
own
about
clarence
what
a
pretty
interesting
superior
name
clarence
was
which
she
could
not
be
permitted
to
know
if
you
talk
like
that
said
anne
dorset
to
sophy
you
will
set
her
little
head
afloat
about
good
matches
and
spoil
her
too
and
a
very
good
thing
said
sophy
if
you
had
put
the
idea
into
my
head
i
should
not
be
sophy
dorset
now
why
should
she
think
of
a
good
match
can
she
live
there
for
ever
in
that
dreadful
parsonage
among
all
those
children
whom
she
does
not
know
how
to
manage
do
be
absurd
anne
except
an
elder
daughter
like
you
here
and
there
you
know
girls
must
marry
if
they
are
to
be
of
any
consequence
in
the
world
let
them
get
it
into
their
heads
we
ca
change
what
is
the
course
of
nature
as
papa
says
oh
sophy
it
is
so
unwomanly
never
mind
when
a
man
chuckles
and
jeers
at
me
because
i
am
unmarried
i
think
it
is
unmanly
but
they
all
do
it
and
no
one
finds
any
fault
not
all
surely
not
near
do
they
not
to
our
faces
perhaps
but
whenever
they
write
whenever
they
speak
in
public
when
men
are
so
mean
why
should
we
train
girls
up
to
unnatural
why
that
is
the
sort
of
girl
who
ought
to
make
a
good
marriage
to
somebody
or
have
somebody
for
her
she
is
pretty
and
soft
and
not
very
wise
i
am
doing
the
very
best
thing
in
the
world
for
her
when
i
laugh
at
love
and
all
that
nonsense
and
put
a
good
match
into
her
mind
miss
dorset
turned
away
with
a
sigh
and
shook
her
head
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
encounter
sophy
in
argument
was
beyond
her
power
and
if
it
had
not
been
beyond
her
power
what
would
have
been
the
good
of
it
sophy
had
a
story
which
unfortunately
most
people
knew
she
had
been
romantic
and
she
had
been
disappointed
five
or
six
years
before
she
had
been
engaged
to
a
clergyman
who
finding
that
the
good
living
he
was
waiting
for
in
order
to
marry
was
not
likely
to
come
through
sir
robert
influence
intimated
to
his
betrothed
his
serious
doubt
whether
they
were
likely
to
be
happy
together
and
broke
off
the
engagement
he
married
somebody
else
in
six
months
and
sophy
was
left
to
bear
the
shame
as
she
might
to
be
sure
a
great
many
people
were
highly
indignant
with
him
at
the
moment
his
sin
however
was
forgotten
long
ago
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
but
nobody
forgot
that
sophy
had
been
jilted
and
she
did
not
forget
it
herself
which
was
worse
therefore
miss
dorset
attempted
no
argument
with
her
sister
she
shook
her
gentle
head
and
said
nothing
anne
was
the
elder
sister
born
the
who
is
a
clearly
defined
type
of
humanity
though
rare
perhaps
like
all
the
finer
sorts
she
resolved
in
her
own
mind
to
take
private
means
for
the
fortification
and
preservation
of
ursula
whose
position
as
elder
sister
of
a
motherless
family
interested
her
especially
as
being
like
her
own
but
anne
owned
within
herself
that
she
had
never
been
so
young
as
little
ursula
may
ursula
for
her
part
thought
very
little
about
the
question
which
had
thus
moved
her
cousins
she
thought
clarence
copperhead
was
very
nice
and
that
if
she
had
but
known
as
many
people
and
had
as
many
partners
as
that
young
lady
in
black
she
would
have
enjoyed
the
ball
very
much
after
all
now
that
it
was
over
she
felt
that
she
had
enjoyed
it
three
dances
were
a
great
deal
better
than
none
at
all
and
to
have
that
pretty
white
frock
given
to
her
by
sir
robert
was
no
small
matter
besides
for
in
this
as
in
other
things
the
uses
of
adversity
are
sometimes
sweet
the
pretty
dress
which
no
doubt
would
have
been
torn
and
crumpled
had
she
danced
much
was
almost
quite
fresh
now
and
would
do
very
well
at
carlingford
if
there
should
be
any
balls
there
events
which
happened
occasionally
though
ursula
had
never
been
lucky
enough
to
go
to
any
of
them
and
cousin
sophy
had
given
her
a
set
of
venetian
beads
and
cousin
anne
a
bracelet
this
good
fortune
was
quite
enough
to
fill
her
mind
with
satisfaction
and
prevent
any
undue
meditation
upon
good
matches
or
the
attentions
of
clarence
copperhead
ursula
was
as
different
as
possible
from
phoebe
beecham
she
had
no
pretensions
to
be
intellectual
she
preferred
the
company
even
of
her
very
smallest
brothers
and
sisters
to
the
conversation
of
her
papa
though
he
was
known
to
be
one
of
the
most
superior
men
in
the
diocese
even
when
her
elder
brother
reginald
of
whom
she
was
very
fond
came
home
from
college
ursula
was
more
than
indifferent
to
the
privileged
position
of
elder
sister
by
which
she
was
permitted
to
sit
up
and
assist
at
the
talks
which
were
carried
on
between
him
and
his
father
reginald
was
very
clever
too
he
was
making
his
own
way
at
the
university
by
means
of
scholarships
the
only
way
in
which
a
son
of
may
was
likely
to
get
to
the
university
at
all
and
to
hear
him
talk
with
his
father
about
greek
poetry
and
philosophy
was
a
very
fine
thing
indeed
how
phoebe
beecham
if
the
chance
had
been
hers
would
have
prized
it
but
ursula
did
not
enjoy
the
privilege
she
preferred
a
pantomime
or
the
poorest
performance
in
a
theatre
or
even
madame
tussaud
exhibition
she
preferred
even
to
walk
about
the
gay
streets
with
miss
dorset
maid
and
look
into
the
and
speculate
what
was
going
to
be
worn
next
season
poor
little
girl
with
such
innocent
and
frivolous
tastes
it
may
be
supposed
she
did
not
find
her
position
as
elder
sister
and
housekeeper
a
very
congenial
one
her
father
was
no
more
than
incumbent
of
roque
an
old
perpetual
curacy
merged
in
a
district
church
which
was
a
poor
appointment
for
an
elderly
man
with
a
family
he
was
very
clever
and
superior
but
not
a
man
who
got
on
or
who
did
much
to
help
his
children
to
get
on
and
had
ursula
been
of
the
kind
of
those
who
suffer
and
deny
themselves
by
nature
she
would
have
had
her
hands
full
and
abundant
opportunity
afforded
her
to
exercise
those
faculties
but
she
was
not
of
this
frame
of
mind
she
did
what
she
was
obliged
to
do
as
well
as
time
and
opportunity
permitted
but
she
did
not
throw
herself
with
any
enthusiasm
into
her
duties
to
keep
seven
children
in
good
condition
and
discipline
in
a
small
house
on
a
small
income
is
more
it
must
be
allowed
than
most
girls
of
twenty
are
equal
to
only
enthusiasm
and
could
make
such
a
task
possible
and
these
qualifications
poor
little
ursula
did
not
possess
oh
how
glad
she
was
to
get
away
from
it
all
from
having
to
think
of
janey
and
johnny
and
amy
and
little
robin
she
was
not
anxious
about
how
things
might
be
going
on
in
her
absence
as
kind
miss
dorset
thought
she
must
be
the
happiness
of
escaping
was
first
and
foremost
in
her
thoughts
chapter
copperhead
manner
is
not
pleasant
sometimes
that
is
quite
true
we
must
make
allowances
my
dear
great
wealth
you
know
has
its
temptations
you
ca
expect
a
man
with
so
much
money
and
so
many
people
under
him
to
have
the
same
consideration
for
other
feelings
he
says
to
this
man
go
and
he
goeth
and
to
that
man
come
and
he
cometh
that
is
all
very
well
said
phoebe
but
he
has
no
right
that
i
can
think
of
to
be
rude
to
mamma
and
me
he
was
not
exactly
rude
my
dear
said
beecham
we
must
not
say
he
was
rude
clarence
ought
to
have
divided
his
attentions
more
equally
we
must
admit
and
his
father
was
annoyed
for
the
moment
i
have
no
doubt
he
has
forgotten
all
about
it
long
ago
and
will
be
as
pleasant
as
ever
next
time
we
meet
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
said
the
pastor
and
at
the
worst
it
was
but
his
manner
only
his
manner
in
short
at
the
committee
meeting
yesterday
nothing
could
have
been
nicer
he
went
even
out
of
his
way
to
send
as
it
were
a
kind
message
to
phoebe
need
ask
if
miss
phoebe
enjoyed
herself
he
said
depend
upon
it
my
dear
if
there
was
a
temporary
annoyance
it
is
both
forgotten
and
forgiven
so
far
as
copperhead
is
concerned
forgiven
phoebe
said
to
herself
but
she
thought
it
wiser
to
say
nothing
audible
on
the
subject
her
father
and
mother
it
was
evident
were
both
disposed
to
extend
any
amount
of
toleration
to
the
leading
member
it
was
he
who
was
the
best
judge
as
to
what
he
had
a
right
to
be
annoyed
about
the
family
party
were
in
beecham
study
where
the
large
bust
of
copperhead
stood
on
the
mantelpiece
the
chief
decoration
how
could
any
one
be
so
wicked
as
to
rebel
against
the
influence
of
so
great
a
personage
phoebe
had
her
own
ideas
but
she
was
wise
and
kept
them
to
herself
and
now
said
beecham
solemnly
what
is
to
be
done
my
dear
about
this
letter
from
my
good
papa
phoebe
was
standing
in
front
of
a
apparently
looking
for
a
book
she
said
nothing
but
it
was
easy
to
perceive
by
the
erectness
of
her
shoulders
and
the
slight
movement
that
ran
through
her
that
her
attention
was
fully
engaged
ah
yes
indeed
what
about
it
the
pastor
said
he
put
down
the
pen
which
he
had
been
holding
in
his
hand
by
way
of
symbol
that
amiable
as
he
was
his
attention
to
his
was
an
encroachment
upon
time
which
might
be
more
usefully
employed
but
this
was
a
serious
question
he
had
no
suggestion
to
offer
but
he
sat
and
twiddled
his
thumbs
and
looked
at
his
wife
with
interest
suddenly
aroused
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
thought
of
said
beecham
it
is
not
a
simple
matter
of
family
devotion
of
course
if
i
had
no
other
ties
nor
other
duties
everything
would
be
easy
i
should
go
at
once
to
my
poor
suffering
mamma
beecham
was
a
clever
woman
but
she
had
not
been
able
to
get
it
out
of
her
mind
owing
to
the
imperfections
of
her
education
in
youth
that
it
was
a
vulgar
thing
to
say
father
and
mother
but
in
the
present
circumstances
she
continued
her
husband
having
given
his
assent
to
this
speech
it
is
clear
that
i
can
not
do
what
i
wish
i
have
you
to
think
of
my
dear
and
the
children
and
the
duties
of
my
position
on
the
other
hand
of
course
i
could
not
wish
as
poor
mamma
only
daughter
to
have
my
called
in
she
is
not
the
kind
of
person
she
is
underbred
uneducated
of
course
she
would
be
thinking
of
her
own
children
and
what
would
be
best
for
them
my
parents
have
done
all
that
ought
to
be
expected
from
them
for
tom
considering
all
things
what
they
have
to
dispose
of
ought
to
go
to
phoebe
and
tozer
but
tom
would
not
see
that
it
is
very
true
my
dear
i
do
suppose
she
would
said
beecham
with
an
anxious
air
tom
said
his
wife
with
some
heat
would
think
her
own
had
the
first
claim
she
maintained
it
to
my
very
face
and
after
that
what
have
we
to
expect
it
us
that
are
tozers
she
said
as
for
you
phoebe
you
belong
to
another
family
i
put
it
in
my
own
language
of
course
not
in
her
vulgar
way
it
is
a
very
serious
question
altogether
said
the
pastor
with
some
solemnity
i
do
see
how
you
can
get
away
and
i
do
know
what
is
to
be
done
whatever
is
to
be
done
i
wo
leave
poor
mamma
in
the
hands
of
tom
cries
beecham
not
whatever
it
costs
me
she
capable
of
anything
that
woman
is
to
have
her
in
the
same
town
is
bad
enough
but
in
the
same
house
nursing
poor
mamma
you
and
i
would
never
see
a
penny
of
the
money
henery
nor
our
children
not
a
penny
besides
the
vexation
of
seeing
one
own
parents
turned
against
one
i
know
very
well
how
it
would
be
beecham
ceased
twiddling
his
thumbs
the
crisis
was
too
serious
for
that
indulgence
the
position
is
most
difficult
he
said
i
see
it
all
it
is
easy
to
see
it
for
that
matter
but
to
decide
what
are
we
to
do
is
not
easy
to
go
back
to
carlingford
after
so
many
changes
would
it
be
good
for
you
it
would
kill
me
said
beecham
with
energy
you
know
it
would
kill
me
envy
drove
us
out
and
envy
would
bring
me
to
the
grave
i
do
deceive
myself
that
is
what
i
see
before
me
if
i
tear
myself
from
all
my
duties
and
go
but
on
the
other
hand
listen
mamma
cried
phoebe
turning
round
suddenly
if
grandmamma
is
ill
and
you
are
afraid
to
leave
her
alone
why
not
send
me
both
her
parents
turned
towards
phoebe
as
she
spoke
they
listened
to
her
with
wonder
and
consternation
yet
with
admiring
looks
then
they
looked
at
each
other
consulting
alarmed
you
said
beecham
and
you
echoed
the
pastor
repeating
in
his
great
astonishment
what
his
wife
said
yes
indeed
me
why
not
me
it
would
be
only
my
duty
said
phoebe
with
great
composure
and
there
is
nothing
to
keep
me
from
going
i
almost
think
i
should
like
it
but
anyhow
mamma
if
you
think
it
necessary
whether
i
like
it
or
not
phoebe
my
darling
you
are
the
best
child
in
the
world
cried
her
mother
rising
up
and
going
to
her
hastily
she
gave
her
a
kiss
of
maternal
enthusiasm
and
then
she
looked
at
her
husband
but
should
we
take
advantage
of
it
she
said
you
see
my
dear
said
beecham
hesitating
you
might
find
many
things
different
from
what
you
are
used
to
your
grandpapa
tozer
is
an
excellent
man
a
most
excellent
man
yes
yes
said
his
wife
with
some
impatience
she
was
as
conscious
as
he
was
of
the
great
elevation
in
the
social
scale
that
had
occurred
to
both
of
them
since
they
left
carlingford
and
knew
as
well
as
he
did
that
the
old
people
had
remained
stationary
while
the
younger
ones
had
made
such
advances
but
still
she
did
not
like
to
hear
her
husband
criticize
her
father
what
there
was
to
be
said
she
preferred
to
say
herself
yes
yes
she
said
phoebe
knows
there
is
a
difference
they
are
folks
and
do
live
quite
as
we
live
some
things
would
strike
you
very
strangely
my
dear
some
things
you
would
not
like
and
then
phoebe
may
be
for
anything
i
can
tell
at
a
in
her
own
life
if
you
mean
about
the
copperheads
mamma
dismiss
that
from
your
mind
said
phoebe
there
is
no
sort
of
hurry
we
may
be
thrown
together
in
and
of
course
no
one
can
tell
what
may
happen
but
in
the
mean
time
there
is
nothing
of
the
sort
in
my
mind
nor
in
any
one
else
do
not
think
of
that
for
a
moment
i
am
at
no
i
am
quite
ready
and
quite
willing
to
go
wherever
you
please
once
more
the
parent
pair
looked
at
each
other
they
had
been
very
careful
not
to
bring
their
children
into
contact
since
they
were
children
with
the
homelier
circumstances
of
the
life
in
which
they
themselves
had
both
taken
their
origin
they
had
managed
this
really
with
great
skill
and
discretion
instead
of
visiting
the
tozers
at
carlingford
they
had
appointed
meetings
at
the
by
means
of
which
the
children
were
trained
in
affectionate
acquaintance
with
their
grandparents
without
any
knowledge
of
the
shop
and
tozer
who
was
only
a
butterman
at
carlingford
presented
all
the
appearance
of
an
old
dissenting
minister
out
of
it
not
very
refined
perhaps
as
beecham
allowed
but
very
kind
and
the
most
doting
of
grandfathers
the
wisp
of
white
neckcloth
round
his
neck
and
his
black
coat
and
a
certain
unction
of
manner
all
favoured
the
idea
theoretically
the
young
people
knew
it
was
not
so
but
the
impression
on
their
imagination
was
to
this
effect
tozer
was
only
grandmamma
she
was
kind
too
and
if
rather
gorgeous
in
the
way
of
ribbons
and
dressing
generally
in
a
manner
which
phoebe
taste
condemned
yet
she
came
quite
within
the
range
of
that
affectionate
contempt
with
which
youth
tolerates
the
disadvantages
of
its
seniors
but
the
butterman
shop
and
the
entire
cutting
off
from
everything
superior
to
the
grocers
and
poulterers
of
carlingford
how
would
phoebe
support
it
this
was
what
and
beecham
asked
each
other
with
their
eyes
and
there
was
a
pause
for
the
question
was
a
tremendous
one
and
neither
knew
in
what
way
to
reply
phoebe
you
are
a
very
sensible
girl
said
her
father
at
last
faltering
i
beg
your
pardon
papa
i
do
think
you
are
treating
me
as
if
i
were
sensible
said
phoebe
i
know
well
enough
that
grandpapa
is
in
business
if
that
is
what
you
are
afraid
of
has
been
in
business
said
beecham
your
grandpapa
has
retired
for
some
time
to
be
sure
she
added
turning
to
her
husband
it
is
only
tom
that
has
the
business
and
as
i
consider
tom
objectionable
phoebe
need
not
be
brought
in
contact
if
phoebe
goes
to
carlingford
said
the
pastor
she
must
not
be
disagreeable
to
any
one
we
must
make
up
our
minds
to
that
they
must
not
call
her
stuck
up
and
proud
henery
said
beecham
i
can
put
up
with
a
great
deal
but
to
think
of
a
child
of
mine
being
exposed
to
the
tongues
of
those
browns
and
pigeons
and
tom
is
more
than
i
can
bear
what
i
went
through
myself
you
never
knew
nor
any
one
breathing
the
looks
they
gave
me
the
things
they
kept
saying
the
little
nods
at
one
another
every
time
i
passed
was
it
my
fault
that
i
was
better
educated
and
more
refined
like
than
they
were
in
vincent
time
before
you
came
henery
he
was
a
very
young
man
and
he
used
to
come
to
the
high
street
constantly
to
supper
it
was
my
doing
i
never
asked
him
no
more
than
i
did
you
your
father
used
to
ask
me
said
beecham
doubtfully
it
was
very
kind
a
young
pastor
expects
it
in
a
new
place
and
a
great
many
things
arise
there
is
no
doubt
in
that
way
not
by
my
doing
said
the
lady
and
when
we
were
married
henery
the
things
i
did
to
please
them
thank
heaven
they
know
the
difference
now
but
if
they
were
to
set
themselves
as
i
could
quite
expect
of
them
against
my
child
mamma
said
phoebe
tranquilly
i
think
you
forget
that
it
is
me
you
are
talking
of
i
hope
i
know
what
a
pastor
daughter
owes
to
herself
i
have
had
my
training
i
do
think
you
need
be
frightened
for
me
no
i
think
phoebe
could
manage
them
if
any
one
could
said
her
father
complacently
she
smiled
with
a
gracious
response
to
this
approval
she
had
a
book
in
her
hand
which
of
itself
was
a
proof
of
phoebe
pretensions
it
was
i
think
one
of
the
volumes
of
stuart
mill
dissertations
phoebe
was
not
above
reading
novels
or
other
light
literature
but
this
only
in
the
moments
dedicated
to
amusement
and
the
present
hour
was
morning
a
time
not
for
amusement
but
for
work
phoebe
do
know
carlingford
nor
the
folks
there
said
beecham
flushed
by
the
thought
and
too
much
excited
to
think
of
the
elegancies
of
diction
she
had
suffered
more
than
her
husband
had
and
retained
a
more
forcible
idea
of
the
perils
and
in
the
pause
which
ensued
all
these
perils
crowded
into
her
mind
as
her
own
ambition
rose
she
had
felt
how
dreadful
it
was
to
be
shut
in
to
one
small
circle
of
very
small
folks
she
had
felt
the
injurious
line
of
separation
between
the
shopkeepers
and
the
rest
of
the
world
at
least
she
thought
she
had
felt
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
it
very
doubtful
whether
phoebe
tozer
had
felt
anything
of
the
kind
but
she
thought
so
now
and
then
it
was
a
fact
that
she
was
born
phoebe
tozer
and
was
used
to
that
life
whereas
phoebe
beecham
had
no
such
knowledge
she
had
never
been
aware
of
the
limitations
of
a
small
dissenting
community
in
a
small
town
and
though
she
knew
how
much
the
crescent
congregation
thought
of
a
stray
millionnaire
like
copperhead
a
thing
which
seemed
too
natural
to
miss
beecham
to
leave
any
room
for
remark
her
mother
thought
that
it
might
have
a
bad
effect
upon
phoebe
principles
in
every
way
should
she
find
out
the
lowly
place
held
by
the
connection
in
such
an
tory
town
as
carlingford
what
would
phoebe
think
how
would
she
manage
to
associate
with
the
browns
and
the
pigeons
fortunately
and
tozer
had
retired
from
the
shop
but
the
shop
was
still
there
greasy
and
buttery
as
ever
and
own
respected
papa
was
still
the
butterman
how
would
phoebe
bear
it
this
was
the
uppermost
thought
in
her
mind
you
know
my
darling
she
said
afterwards
when
they
had
left
the
study
and
were
seated
talking
it
over
in
the
there
will
be
a
great
deal
to
put
up
with
i
am
silly
i
do
like
even
to
hear
your
papa
say
anything
about
dear
old
grandpapa
he
is
my
own
and
i
ought
to
stand
up
for
him
but
even
with
grandpapa
you
will
have
a
great
deal
to
put
up
with
they
do
understand
our
ways
they
are
used
to
have
things
so
different
they
think
differently
and
they
talk
differently
even
with
your
sense
phoebe
you
will
find
it
hard
to
get
on
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
i
assure
you
mamma
you
are
not
afraid
because
you
do
know
i
know
and
i
am
afraid
you
know
we
are
not
great
people
phoebe
i
have
always
let
you
know
that
and
that
it
is
far
finer
to
elevate
yourself
than
to
be
born
to
a
good
position
but
when
you
see
really
the
place
which
poor
dear
grandpapa
and
grandmamma
think
so
much
of
i
am
sure
i
do
know
what
you
will
say
i
shall
not
say
much
i
shall
not
say
anything
mamma
i
am
not
prejudiced
said
phoebe
so
long
as
an
occupation
is
honest
and
honourable
and
you
can
do
your
duty
in
it
what
does
it
matter
one
kind
of
work
is
just
as
good
as
another
it
is
the
spirit
in
which
it
is
done
oh
honest
said
beecham
half
relieved
half
affronted
of
course
it
was
all
that
nothing
else
would
have
answered
papa
your
uncle
tom
has
the
business
now
you
need
not
go
there
my
dear
unless
you
like
i
am
not
fond
of
tom
we
were
always
so
to
speak
above
our
station
but
she
is
not
at
all
above
it
she
is
just
adapted
for
it
and
i
do
think
she
would
suit
you
in
the
least
so
except
just
for
a
formal
call
i
do
think
you
need
go
there
and
even
that
only
if
grandmamma
can
spare
you
you
must
be
civil
to
everybody
i
suppose
but
you
need
not
go
further
they
are
not
society
for
you
you
will
hear
people
talk
of
me
by
my
christian
name
as
if
we
were
most
intimate
but
do
believe
it
phoebe
i
always
felt
aspirations
towards
a
very
different
kind
of
life
oh
do
be
afraid
mamma
said
phoebe
calmly
i
shall
be
able
to
keep
them
at
a
distance
you
need
not
fear
yes
my
dear
said
the
anxious
mother
but
not
too
much
at
a
distance
either
that
is
just
what
is
so
difficult
if
they
can
find
an
excuse
for
saying
that
my
child
is
stuck
up
oh
nothing
would
please
them
more
than
to
be
able
to
find
out
something
against
my
child
when
you
have
apparently
belonged
to
that
low
level
and
then
have
risen
said
beecham
with
a
hot
colour
on
her
cheek
there
is
nothing
these
kind
of
people
will
not
say
these
conversations
raised
a
great
deal
of
thought
in
phoebe
mind
but
they
did
not
change
her
resolution
if
it
was
necessary
that
some
one
should
go
to
look
after
her
grandmamma
and
keep
all
those
vulgar
people
at
bay
and
show
to
the
admiring
world
what
a
dissenting
daughter
could
be
and
what
a
dutiful
daughter
was
then
who
so
fit
as
herself
to
be
the
example
this
gave
her
even
a
certain
tragical
sense
of
heroism
which
was
exhilarating
though
serious
she
thought
of
what
she
would
have
to
put
up
with
as
of
something
much
more
solemn
than
the
reality
more
solemn
but
alas
not
so
troublesome
phoebe
felt
herself
something
like
a
joan
of
arc
as
she
packed
her
clothes
and
made
her
preparations
she
was
going
among
barbarians
a
set
of
people
who
would
not
understand
her
probably
and
whom
she
would
have
to
put
up
with
but
what
of
that
strong
in
a
sense
of
duty
and
superior
to
all
lesser
inducements
she
felt
herself
able
to
triumph
beecham
assisted
with
very
divided
feelings
at
the
preparations
it
was
on
her
lips
to
say
never
mind
the
evening
dresses
you
will
not
want
them
but
then
the
thought
occurred
to
her
that
to
let
the
carlingford
folks
see
what
her
daughter
had
been
used
to
even
if
she
had
no
use
for
such
things
would
be
sweet
no
henery
she
shall
take
them
all
she
said
to
her
husband
they
shall
see
the
kind
of
society
my
child
is
in
very
different
from
their
trumpery
little
teas
they
shall
see
that
you
and
i
we
grudge
nothing
for
phoebe
and
i
dare
be
sworn
there
is
not
one
of
them
like
her
not
even
among
the
quality
i
mean
said
beecham
hastily
with
a
flush
of
distress
at
her
own
failure
in
gentility
among
those
who
think
themselves
better
than
we
are
but
phoebe
will
let
them
see
what
a
pastor
family
is
out
of
their
dirty
little
town
she
will
bring
them
to
their
senses
though
i
hesitated
at
first
when
it
was
spoken
of
i
am
very
glad
now
yes
phoebe
is
a
girl
to
find
her
level
anywhere
said
the
pastor
complacently
and
they
forgot
what
she
would
have
to
put
up
with
in
their
satisfaction
and
admiration
for
herself
chapter
vi
a
morning
call
sir
robert
dorset
and
his
daughter
called
as
in
duty
bound
upon
their
relation
two
days
after
her
ball
you
had
better
come
with
us
ursula
said
miss
dorset
sophy
does
not
care
about
visits
and
copperhead
asked
a
great
many
questions
about
you
she
is
very
to
the
young
anne
had
almost
said
to
the
poor
for
it
is
difficult
to
remember
always
that
the
qualifications
by
which
we
distinguish
our
friends
when
they
are
not
present
are
not
always
satisfactory
to
their
own
ears
she
was
like
you
once
you
know
she
added
half
apologetically
ursula
who
was
not
in
the
least
disposed
to
take
offence
did
not
ask
how
but
assented
as
she
would
have
assented
had
cousin
anne
told
her
to
get
ready
to
go
to
the
moon
she
went
upstairs
and
put
on
her
little
felt
hat
which
had
been
made
handsome
by
the
long
drooping
feather
bestowed
upon
her
by
sophy
and
the
blue
serge
jacket
which
corresponded
with
her
dress
she
had
not
any
great
opinion
of
her
own
good
looks
but
she
hoped
that
she
was
notwithstanding
the
simplicity
of
her
costume
this
was
her
only
aspiration
in
her
heart
she
admired
the
tall
straight
angular
kind
of
beauty
possessed
by
her
cousins
and
did
not
think
much
of
her
own
roundness
and
softness
which
seemed
to
ursula
a
very
inferior
style
but
yet
if
she
looked
that
was
always
something
and
both
sir
robert
and
his
daughter
looked
at
her
approvingly
as
she
stood
buttoning
her
gloves
waiting
for
them
if
there
are
other
city
gentlemen
there
mind
you
make
yourself
very
agreeable
ursula
said
cousin
sophy
which
vexed
the
girl
a
little
whether
the
people
were
city
gentlemen
or
not
of
course
she
said
to
herself
she
would
try
to
be
was
not
that
a
girl
first
duty
she
tried
for
her
part
to
be
to
everybody
to
talk
when
she
could
and
receive
the
recompense
of
pleased
looks
to
walk
with
her
friends
up
the
long
line
of
regent
street
with
many
a
sidelong
glance
into
the
was
very
pleasant
to
ursula
sometimes
even
cousin
anne
would
be
tempted
to
stop
and
look
and
point
things
out
to
her
father
unfortunately
the
things
miss
dorset
remarked
were
chiefly
handsome
pieces
of
furniture
beautiful
carpets
and
the
like
which
were
totally
out
of
ursula
way
there
is
just
the
kind
of
carpet
i
want
for
the
anne
said
looking
at
something
so
splendid
that
ursula
thought
it
was
good
enough
for
the
queen
but
sir
robert
shook
his
head
the
carpet
will
do
very
well
he
said
it
will
last
out
my
day
and
your
brother
will
prefer
to
please
himself
this
brought
a
little
cloud
upon
anne
dorset
placid
face
for
she
too
like
beecham
had
a
brother
whose
wife
it
was
not
agreeable
to
think
of
as
mistress
in
the
old
house
she
went
on
quickly
after
that
looking
in
at
no
more
shops
perhaps
she
who
could
buy
everything
she
wanted
as
ursula
thought
had
on
the
whole
more
painful
feelings
in
looking
at
them
than
had
the
little
girl
beside
her
whose
whole
thoughts
were
occupied
by
the
question
whether
she
would
have
enough
money
left
to
buy
her
sister
janey
one
of
those
new
neckties
which
were
the
fashion
janey
did
not
often
get
anything
that
was
the
fashion
but
at
any
rate
ursula
made
notes
and
laid
up
a
great
many
things
in
her
mind
to
tell
janey
of
which
would
be
next
best
copperhead
was
seated
in
a
corner
of
her
vast
when
her
visitors
arrived
and
her
pale
little
countenance
brightened
at
sight
of
them
they
were
the
nearest
approach
to
her
own
people
that
the
poor
soul
possessed
she
received
their
compliments
upon
her
ball
with
deprecating
looks
i
am
sure
you
are
very
good
very
good
to
say
so
i
am
afraid
it
was
not
much
amusement
to
you
they
were
not
the
kind
of
people
i
scarcely
knew
a
soul
said
sir
robert
it
was
a
curious
sensation
it
does
one
good
now
and
then
to
have
a
sensation
like
that
it
shows
you
that
after
all
you
are
not
such
a
fine
fellow
as
you
thought
yourself
once
before
i
experienced
something
of
the
same
feeling
it
was
at
a
ball
at
the
tuileries
but
even
then
after
a
while
i
found
english
people
i
knew
though
i
did
know
the
french
grandees
but
by
jove
except
yourself
and
copperhead
clara
i
knew
nobody
here
copperhead
felt
the
implied
censure
more
than
she
was
intended
to
feel
it
copperhead
does
not
care
about
cultivating
fashionable
people
she
said
with
a
little
spirit
he
prefers
his
old
friends
that
is
very
nice
of
him
cried
anne
so
much
the
kindest
way
i
liked
it
so
much
at
most
balls
we
go
to
people
come
and
ask
me
to
dance
for
duty
pretending
not
to
see
that
my
dancing
days
are
over
she
talks
nonsense
said
sir
robert
clara
i
must
trust
to
you
to
put
this
notion
out
of
anne
head
why
should
her
dancing
days
be
over
i
am
not
a
methuselah
i
hope
she
has
no
right
to
shelve
herself
so
early
has
she
i
hope
to
see
her
make
a
good
match
before
i
die
so
long
as
she
is
happy
said
copperhead
faltering
she
was
not
any
advocate
for
good
matches
oh
there
is
mr
copperhead
she
added
with
a
little
start
as
a
resounding
knock
was
heard
he
does
not
often
come
home
so
early
he
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
sir
robert
are
you
going
to
stay
long
in
town
miss
may
not
long
only
till
the
children
arrive
said
anne
looking
compassionately
at
the
rich
man
nervous
wife
she
had
been
quiet
enough
so
long
as
she
was
alone
now
a
little
fever
seemed
to
be
awakened
in
her
she
turned
to
ursula
and
began
to
talk
to
her
quickly
do
you
like
being
in
town
it
is
not
a
good
time
of
the
year
it
is
nicer
in
may
when
everything
looks
cheerful
but
i
always
live
in
london
you
will
come
back
for
the
season
i
suppose
oh
no
said
ursula
i
never
was
in
london
before
cousin
anne
brought
me
for
a
great
pleasure
i
have
been
twice
to
the
theatre
and
at
the
ball
here
oh
yes
i
forgot
you
were
at
the
ball
and
you
danced
did
you
dance
i
can
not
remember
there
were
so
many
people
oh
yes
i
recollect
i
spoke
to
clarence
i
danced
three
times
said
ursula
i
never
was
at
a
ball
before
it
was
very
nice
copperhead
was
so
kind
what
is
that
about
copperhead
being
kind
was
i
kind
i
am
always
kind
ask
my
wife
she
will
give
me
a
good
character
said
the
master
of
the
house
coming
up
to
them
ah
the
baronet
how
do
you
do
sir
robert
i
do
often
see
you
in
my
house
you
saw
us
the
other
evening
said
sir
robert
courteously
and
we
have
just
come
anne
and
i
to
let
clara
know
how
much
we
enjoyed
it
it
was
really
splendid
i
do
know
when
i
have
seen
so
much
um
luxury
so
great
a
display
of
of
beautiful
things
and
and
wealth
glad
to
hear
you
were
pleased
said
copperhead
no
expense
was
spared
at
least
i
do
often
throw
away
my
money
in
that
way
but
when
i
do
i
like
things
to
be
regardless
of
expense
that
is
our
way
in
the
city
other
people
have
to
make
a
deal
of
gentility
go
a
long
way
but
with
us
who
do
stand
on
our
gentility
it
is
not
much
to
stand
upon
certainly
in
the
way
of
giving
balls
said
sir
robert
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
money
should
not
be
spared
when
a
good
effect
is
to
be
produced
anne
my
dear
if
you
have
said
all
you
have
to
say
to
clara
you
must
recollect
that
we
have
a
great
deal
to
do
you
are
not
going
the
moment
i
come
in
said
copperhead
come
we
must
have
some
tea
or
something
not
that
i
care
very
much
for
tea
but
i
suppose
you
be
shocked
if
i
offer
you
anything
else
in
the
afternoon
have
you
ordered
tea
copperhead
i
ca
teach
my
wife
hospitality
sir
robert
not
as
i
understand
it
she
see
you
come
and
go
a
dozen
times
i
be
bound
without
once
thinking
of
offering
anything
that
ai
my
way
tea
and
directly
do
you
hear
yes
said
copperhead
in
a
nervous
tremor
bring
tea
burton
please
it
is
rather
early
but
i
do
so
hope
you
will
stay
she
gave
miss
dorset
an
appealing
glance
and
anne
was
too
kind
to
resist
the
appeal
to
be
sure
they
stay
said
copperhead
ladies
never
say
no
to
a
cup
of
tea
and
ours
ought
to
be
good
if
there
any
virtue
in
money
come
and
look
at
my
turner
sir
robert
i
ai
a
judge
of
art
but
it
cost
a
precious
lot
if
that
is
any
test
they
tell
me
it
one
of
the
best
specimens
going
come
this
way
you
wo
mind
said
poor
copperhead
he
is
very
hospitable
he
can
not
bear
that
any
one
should
go
without
taking
something
it
is
but
then
copperhead
it
is
a
most
kind
fashion
i
think
said
anne
dorset
who
had
a
superstitious
regard
for
other
people
feelings
and
copperhead
is
quite
right
i
never
say
no
to
a
cup
of
tea
just
then
clarence
came
in
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
so
curiously
like
his
father
in
his
large
somewhat
loose
figure
as
unlike
him
in
aspect
and
expression
that
even
the
gentle
anne
could
scarcely
help
smiling
when
he
had
shaken
hands
with
miss
dorset
he
dropped
naturally
into
a
seat
beside
ursula
who
dazzled
by
his
position
as
son
of
the
house
and
flattered
by
what
she
called
his
kindness
was
as
much
pleased
by
this
sign
of
preference
as
if
clarence
copperhead
had
been
a
hero
i
hope
you
have
recovered
my
father
ball
he
said
recovered
mr
copperhead
yes
you
think
it
uncivil
but
i
myself
have
scarcely
recovered
yet
the
sort
of
people
he
chose
to
collect
people
whom
nobody
knew
but
copperhead
said
ursula
if
it
was
his
old
friends
as
your
mother
says
how
much
more
noble
of
him
than
if
they
had
been
fine
people
he
did
not
care
for
as
for
me
i
do
know
any
one
anywhere
it
was
all
the
same
to
me
that
was
very
lucky
for
you
said
the
young
man
my
good
cousins
did
not
take
it
so
easily
they
are
your
cousins
too
oh
yes
they
are
so
good
cried
ursula
cousin
sophy
laughs
at
me
sometimes
but
cousin
anne
is
as
kind
as
an
angel
they
have
always
been
good
to
us
all
our
lives
you
live
near
them
perhaps
sir
robert
has
been
kind
enough
to
ask
me
to
the
hall
no
not
near
we
live
at
carlingford
it
is
not
a
place
like
the
dorsets
it
is
a
poor
little
town
where
papa
is
one
of
the
clergymen
we
are
not
county
people
like
them
said
ursula
with
anxious
honesty
that
he
might
not
have
a
false
idea
of
her
pretensions
i
have
never
been
anywhere
all
my
life
and
that
is
why
they
brought
me
here
it
was
by
far
the
most
beautiful
party
i
ever
saw
she
added
with
a
little
enthusiasm
i
never
was
at
a
real
dance
before
i
am
glad
you
thought
it
pretty
said
clarence
i
suppose
it
was
pretty
when
the
rooms
are
nice
and
he
looked
round
the
handsome
room
not
without
a
little
complacency
and
when
there
is
plenty
of
light
and
flowers
and
people
i
suppose
no
dance
can
help
being
a
pretty
sight
that
was
about
all
there
was
no
one
worth
pointing
out
oh
there
were
some
very
pretty
people
said
ursula
there
was
a
young
lady
in
black
she
was
always
dancing
i
should
have
liked
to
know
her
you
danced
with
her
a
great
many
times
mr
copperhead
ah
said
clarence
he
was
not
more
foolish
than
his
neighbours
but
it
flattered
him
that
his
dancing
with
one
person
should
have
been
noticed
especially
by
a
pretty
creature
who
herself
had
attracted
him
and
shared
the
privilege
that
was
miss
beecham
i
did
not
dance
with
her
above
three
or
four
times
of
course
he
said
apologetically
we
are
old
friends
ursula
did
not
know
why
he
should
apologize
she
did
not
intend
to
flirt
not
having
any
knowledge
of
that
pastime
as
yet
she
was
quite
simple
in
her
mention
of
the
other
girl
who
had
attracted
her
attention
now
having
said
all
she
could
remember
to
say
she
stopped
talking
and
her
eyes
turned
to
the
elder
copperhead
who
came
back
followed
by
sir
robert
there
was
a
largeness
about
the
rich
man
which
ursula
not
used
to
rich
men
gazed
at
with
surprise
he
seemed
to
expand
himself
upon
the
air
and
spread
out
his
large
person
as
she
had
never
known
any
one
else
do
and
sir
robert
following
him
looked
so
strangely
different
he
was
very
reluctant
to
be
so
led
about
and
as
it
were
patronized
by
the
master
of
the
house
and
his
repugnance
took
a
curious
form
his
nose
was
slightly
drawn
up
as
if
an
odour
of
something
disagreeable
had
reached
him
ursula
in
her
innocence
wondered
what
it
was
here
the
baronet
clarence
said
copperhead
who
was
slightly
flushed
and
he
doubts
the
turner
being
genuine
my
turner
go
off
at
once
to
those
picture
people
christie
whatever
you
call
them
and
tell
them
i
want
proofs
that
it
genuine
i
am
not
the
sort
of
man
by
george
to
be
cheated
and
they
ought
to
know
that
they
have
had
many
a
hundred
pounds
of
my
money
but
they
shall
never
have
another
penny
if
i
do
get
proofs
it
ai
pleasant
i
can
tell
you
to
hear
the
baronet
or
any
one
else
for
that
matter
running
down
my
pictures
i
did
not
run
it
down
said
sir
robert
with
another
little
curl
of
his
nostrils
what
could
there
be
in
this
grand
big
house
that
could
make
a
disagreeable
smell
i
only
said
that
i
had
seen
copies
that
were
so
wonderfully
good
that
none
but
an
expert
could
tell
the
difference
that
was
all
i
do
say
that
yours
is
one
of
them
no
nor
no
one
shall
cried
copperhead
we
shall
have
the
experts
as
you
call
them
and
settle
it
by
george
there
shall
be
nothing
uncertain
in
my
house
you
can
tell
the
men
it
is
sir
robert
dorset
who
suggested
it
there
nothing
like
a
title
even
when
it
is
much
of
a
title
to
keep
people
up
to
their
work
not
meaning
any
disrespect
to
sir
robert
i
could
buy
him
and
his
up
five
times
over
but
i
ai
sir
robert
and
never
will
be
say
sir
robert
clarence
my
boy
that
bear
weight
it
was
an
unfortunate
observation
on
my
part
said
sir
robert
stiffly
i
have
a
picture
myself
which
i
bought
for
a
correggio
and
which
is
a
mere
copy
i
believe
though
a
very
nice
one
i
hold
my
tongue
on
the
subject
and
nobody
is
the
wiser
anne
my
dear
i
think
we
must
go
now
that
would
never
suit
me
said
the
rich
man
holding
my
tongue
my
way
is
it
copperhead
what
going
after
all
without
your
tea
i
am
afraid
the
baronet
is
touchy
and
does
like
what
i
said
but
nobody
minds
me
i
assure
you
i
say
what
i
think
but
i
mean
any
harm
oh
no
said
anne
drawing
herself
up
while
her
father
took
leave
of
poor
little
tremulous
copperhead
we
really
must
go
we
have
stayed
longer
than
we
meant
to
stay
ursula
your
little
companion
said
copperhead
ah
you
should
take
care
miss
dorset
of
these
little
persons
they
stand
in
the
way
of
the
young
ladies
themselves
often
enough
i
can
tell
you
and
so
can
copperhead
she
knows
he
laughed
and
both
anne
and
ursula
became
aware
that
something
offensive
was
meant
but
what
it
was
neither
of
them
could
make
out
copperhead
whose
intelligence
had
been
quickened
on
that
point
perceived
it
and
trembled
more
and
more
dear
she
said
to
ursula
in
an
agony
though
we
are
not
cousins
we
are
connections
through
your
kind
cousin
anne
for
she
lets
me
call
her
my
cousin
anne
too
perhaps
you
will
come
and
pay
me
a
visit
sometimes
if
if
you
can
be
spared
oh
yes
i
should
be
very
glad
said
ursula
confused
she
did
not
understand
why
sir
robert
should
be
in
such
a
hurry
when
both
young
copperhead
and
his
mother
were
so
kind
as
for
the
other
copperhead
he
did
not
interest
ursula
but
he
went
down
to
the
door
with
them
in
an
excess
of
civility
offering
anne
his
arm
which
she
was
obliged
to
take
much
against
her
will
and
even
ursula
felt
a
passing
pang
of
humiliation
when
the
footman
threw
open
the
great
door
before
them
and
no
carriage
was
visible
oh
you
are
walking
said
copperhead
with
one
of
his
big
laughs
after
all
a
laugh
could
hurt
nobody
why
was
it
that
they
all
felt
irritated
and
injured
even
sir
robert
grew
scarlet
and
when
they
were
outside
on
the
broad
pavement
turned
almost
angrily
upon
his
daughter
i
tell
you
what
anne
he
said
not
if
it
was
to
save
my
life
shall
i
ever
enter
that
brute
doors
again
oh
papa
poor
mrs
copperhead
cried
kind
anne
with
a
wail
in
her
voice
that
was
all
the
reply
she
made
chapter
vii
shopping
next
day
a
telegram
came
from
southampton
announcing
the
arrival
of
the
little
dorsets
which
ursula
rejoiced
over
with
the
rest
yet
was
dreadfully
sorry
for
in
her
heart
now
we
shall
be
able
to
get
home
the
sisters
said
and
she
did
her
best
to
smile
but
to
say
that
she
was
glad
to
leave
london
with
all
its
delights
the
bright
streets
and
the
and
the
theatres
and
the
excitement
of
being
on
a
visit
would
be
a
great
deal
more
than
the
truth
she
was
glad
sympathetically
and
to
please
the
others
but
for
herself
her
heart
fell
it
was
still
winter
and
winter
is
not
lively
in
carlingford
and
there
was
a
great
deal
to
do
at
home
and
many
things
to
put
up
with
to
be
sure
that
was
her
duty
this
was
only
her
pleasure
but
at
twenty
pleasure
is
so
much
more
pleasant
than
duty
ursula
did
not
at
all
rebel
nor
did
she
make
painful
contrasts
in
her
mind
as
so
many
young
people
do
asking
why
are
others
so
well
off
and
i
so
badly
off
but
her
heart
sank
all
the
mendings
all
the
keepings
in
order
the
dinners
to
be
invented
with
a
due
regard
for
the
butcher
bill
the
tradespeople
to
be
kept
in
good
humour
the
servant
to
be
managed
and
papa
who
was
more
difficult
than
the
servant
and
more
troublesome
than
the
children
if
ursula
sighed
over
the
prospect
i
do
think
the
severest
of
recording
angels
would
put
a
very
bad
mark
against
her
she
had
been
free
of
all
this
for
ten
wonderful
days
no
torn
frocks
no
unpleasant
baker
no
hole
in
the
carpet
no
spoiled
had
disturbed
her
repose
all
these
troubles
no
doubt
were
going
on
as
usual
at
home
and
janey
and
the
maid
were
struggling
with
them
as
best
they
could
had
ursula
been
very
and
given
up
to
her
duty
no
doubt
she
would
have
been
too
much
moved
by
the
thought
of
what
her
young
sister
might
be
enduring
in
her
absence
to
get
the
good
of
her
holiday
but
i
fear
this
was
not
how
she
felt
it
janey
no
doubt
would
get
through
somehow
and
it
was
very
sweet
to
escape
for
ever
so
short
a
time
and
have
a
real
rest
therefore
it
must
be
allowed
that
when
ursula
went
to
her
after
this
news
arrived
she
relieved
herself
by
a
good
cry
two
or
three
days
longer
what
difference
could
that
have
made
to
those
children
but
after
her
headache
was
relieved
in
this
way
the
cloud
dispersed
a
little
the
thought
of
all
she
had
to
tell
janey
consoled
her
she
counted
over
the
spare
contents
of
her
purse
and
calculated
that
after
all
she
would
have
enough
to
buy
the
necktie
and
she
had
all
her
presents
to
exhibit
the
that
acquisition
the
venetian
beads
the
bracelet
which
is
really
good
gold
fancy
said
ursula
to
herself
weighing
it
in
her
hand
how
janey
would
be
interested
how
she
would
be
dazzled
there
was
a
great
deal
of
consolation
in
this
thought
in
the
afternoon
her
cousins
took
her
out
shopping
an
occupation
which
all
young
girls
and
women
like
they
bought
a
great
many
things
for
the
spring
and
for
the
children
while
ursula
looked
on
with
admiration
to
be
able
to
buy
things
three
months
in
advance
three
months
before
they
could
possibly
be
wanted
what
luxury
and
yet
the
dorsets
were
not
rich
or
so
at
least
people
said
now
ursula
said
cousin
anne
we
have
made
all
our
purchases
suppose
you
choose
frocks
for
the
children
at
home
oh
me
cried
poor
ursula
forgetting
grammar
she
blushed
very
red
and
looked
not
without
indignation
into
anne
dorset
mild
eyes
you
know
i
have
not
any
money
you
know
we
ca
afford
it
she
cried
with
starting
tears
but
i
can
said
cousin
anne
at
least
i
have
some
money
just
now
money
always
goes
whether
one
buys
things
or
not
she
added
with
a
little
sigh
it
runs
through
one
fingers
when
one
has
something
to
show
for
it
that
is
always
a
satisfaction
come
this
would
be
pretty
for
little
amy
but
it
is
you
who
must
choose
but
cousin
anne
dresses
if
it
was
a
necktie
or
a
ribbon
but
frocks
frocks
would
be
most
useful
would
they
one
for
amy
and
one
for
janey
i
suppose
robin
does
not
wear
frocks
now
he
has
been
in
knickerbockers
these
two
years
said
ursula
half
proud
half
sorry
and
the
worst
of
it
is
they
ca
be
made
at
home
papa
says
boys
clothes
made
at
home
are
always
spoiled
and
the
tailor
is
so
dear
oh
cousin
anne
are
you
really
really
going
to
be
so
very
very
good
copperhead
came
into
the
shop
while
they
were
choosing
poor
little
woman
she
who
trembled
so
in
her
own
house
how
everybody
bowed
down
before
her
at
margrove
and
snelcher
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
extricate
herself
from
a
crowd
of
anxious
officials
all
eager
to
supply
her
with
everything
that
heart
could
desire
when
she
saw
the
little
party
she
came
up
to
them
almost
running
in
her
eagerness
her
small
pale
face
flushed
and
leaned
on
anne
dorset
chair
and
whispered
to
her
you
will
not
be
angry
dear
kind
anne
you
are
always
so
good
to
everybody
oh
forgive
me
forgive
me
ursula
could
not
help
hearing
what
she
said
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
mrs
copperhead
oh
dear
anne
but
i
am
more
than
myself
you
know
he
does
not
mean
it
he
never
was
brought
up
to
know
better
he
thinks
that
is
how
people
behave
please
do
say
anything
dear
mrs
copperhead
not
if
you
will
forgive
not
if
you
will
promise
to
forgive
poor
clarence
is
cried
the
poor
woman
he
is
so
frightened
for
what
you
must
think
we
do
think
anything
said
sophy
breaking
in
it
is
one
of
our
good
qualities
as
a
family
that
we
never
think
come
and
help
us
we
are
choosing
frocks
for
ursula
sisters
she
has
two
what
are
their
ages
ursula
you
who
live
in
town
and
know
the
fashions
come
and
help
us
to
choose
and
how
respectful
all
the
shopmen
grew
when
the
nameless
country
party
was
joined
by
the
great
copperhead
or
rather
the
great
copperhead
wife
at
whose
command
was
unlimited
credit
and
all
the
contents
of
the
shop
if
she
chose
one
hurried
forward
to
give
her
a
chair
and
quite
a
grand
personage
a
head
man
came
from
another
counter
to
take
the
charge
of
pleasing
such
a
customer
ursula
could
not
but
look
upon
the
whole
transaction
with
awe
copperhead
was
a
very
humble
timid
woman
and
copperhead
was
not
nice
but
it
was
something
to
command
the
reverence
of
all
the
people
in
such
a
grand
shop
a
shop
which
ursula
by
herself
would
scarcely
have
ventured
to
enter
and
in
which
she
felt
timid
and
overwhelmed
saying
sir
to
the
gentleman
who
was
so
good
as
to
ask
what
she
wanted
but
here
copperhead
was
not
afraid
she
gave
herself
up
with
her
whole
heart
to
the
delightful
perplexity
of
choice
and
when
that
matter
was
settled
looked
round
with
searching
eyes
do
they
want
something
else
she
said
it
is
so
long
since
i
have
bought
any
children
things
it
reminds
me
of
the
days
when
clarence
was
little
when
i
took
such
pride
in
his
dress
come
with
me
into
the
cloak
room
my
dear
i
am
sure
they
must
want
jackets
or
something
ursula
resisted
with
pitiful
looks
at
cousin
anne
and
sophy
whispered
into
copperhead
ear
an
explanation
which
instead
of
quenching
her
ardour
brought
it
up
instantly
to
boiling
point
her
pale
little
languid
countenance
glowed
and
shone
she
took
both
ursula
hands
in
hers
half
smiling
half
crying
oh
my
dear
she
said
you
can
give
me
such
a
pleasure
if
you
will
you
know
we
are
connections
almost
relations
let
me
send
them
something
dear
children
i
wish
i
could
see
them
come
and
look
at
the
little
jackets
and
mantles
i
have
often
thought
if
providence
had
given
me
a
little
girl
what
pleasure
i
should
have
had
in
dressing
her
hats
too
i
am
sure
they
must
want
hats
come
my
dear
come
and
look
at
them
ursula
did
not
know
what
to
do
a
little
pride
and
a
great
deal
of
shyness
kept
her
back
but
copperhead
was
too
much
in
earnest
to
be
crossed
she
bought
a
couple
of
very
smart
little
upper
garments
for
amy
and
janey
and
then
clandestinely
taking
no
one
into
her
confidence
for
ursula
herself
and
gave
secret
orders
to
have
them
all
sent
to
the
dorsets
lodgings
that
night
she
was
quite
transformed
so
long
as
this
transaction
lasted
her
languid
countenance
grew
bright
her
pale
eyes
lighted
up
you
have
given
me
such
a
pleasure
she
said
holding
ursula
hands
and
standing
up
on
to
kiss
her
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
i
could
almost
think
that
clarence
was
little
again
or
that
he
had
got
a
little
sister
which
was
always
my
heart
desire
ah
well
often
often
it
seems
better
for
us
not
to
have
our
heart
desire
my
dear
at
least
i
suppose
that
is
how
it
must
be
i
do
not
know
how
to
thank
you
said
ursula
you
have
been
so
kind
so
very
kind
i
have
been
kind
to
myself
said
copperhead
i
have
so
enjoyed
it
and
my
dear
she
added
with
some
solemnity
still
holding
ursula
by
the
hands
promise
you
will
do
me
one
favour
more
it
will
be
such
a
favour
whenever
you
want
anything
for
yourself
or
your
sister
will
you
write
to
me
i
am
always
in
london
except
in
autumn
and
i
should
so
like
to
do
your
commissions
people
who
live
in
london
know
how
to
get
bargains
my
dear
you
must
promise
to
let
me
do
them
for
you
it
will
make
me
so
happy
promise
cried
the
little
woman
quite
bright
in
her
excitement
ursula
looked
at
the
two
others
who
were
looking
on
and
did
not
know
what
to
say
she
thinks
you
are
too
expensive
an
agent
for
her
said
sophy
dorset
and
i
think
so
too
copperhead
face
faded
out
of
its
pleasant
glow
there
are
two
things
i
have
a
great
deal
too
much
of
she
said
money
and
time
i
am
never
so
happy
as
when
i
am
buying
things
for
children
and
i
can
see
that
she
will
trust
me
wo
you
my
dear
must
we
say
now
could
i
take
you
anywhere
look
at
that
big
carriage
all
for
me
alone
a
little
light
woman
let
me
take
you
somewhere
no
ah
cousin
anne
you
have
not
forgiven
us
for
all
you
said
we
have
some
other
things
to
do
said
anne
drawing
back
as
for
ursula
she
would
not
at
all
have
objected
to
the
splendour
of
the
carriage
and
her
heart
was
melted
by
the
lonely
little
woman
pathetic
looks
but
the
other
ladies
stood
out
they
stood
by
while
poor
copperhead
got
into
the
carriage
and
drove
off
her
pale
reproachful
little
face
looking
at
them
wistfully
from
the
window
it
was
afternoon
by
this
time
getting
dark
and
it
was
a
tolerably
long
walk
along
the
lighted
crowded
streets
cousin
anne
i
am
afraid
we
have
hurt
her
feelings
said
ursula
why
would
you
go
go
cried
mild
anne
dorset
get
into
that
man
carriage
after
yesterday
not
for
the
world
i
can
put
up
with
a
great
deal
but
i
ca
go
so
far
as
that
she
never
did
any
harm
said
sophy
poor
little
soul
you
see
now
ursula
do
you
how
fine
it
is
to
marry
a
rich
man
and
have
everything
that
your
heart
can
desire
ursula
looked
at
her
wondering
to
tell
the
truth
eagerness
to
buy
everything
she
could
think
of
for
the
unknown
children
at
carlingford
the
manner
with
which
she
was
regarded
in
the
great
shop
her
lavish
liberality
her
beautiful
carriage
and
all
the
fine
things
about
her
had
brought
ursula
to
this
very
thought
that
it
was
extremely
fine
to
marry
a
rich
man
sophy
irony
was
lost
upon
her
cousin
and
so
indeed
was
copperhead
pathos
that
she
was
very
kind
and
that
she
was
not
very
happy
were
both
apparent
but
ursula
did
not
connect
the
unhappiness
with
the
fact
that
she
was
a
rich
man
wife
copperhead
certainly
was
not
very
but
when
people
got
so
old
as
that
they
never
were
very
happy
ursula
thought
and
what
had
the
money
to
do
with
it
she
looked
confused
and
puzzled
at
sophy
wondering
what
she
meant
yes
indeed
to
marry
a
rich
man
to
be
able
to
buy
presents
for
everyone
to
make
the
children
at
home
perfectly
happy
without
any
trouble
to
one
self
could
any
one
doubt
that
it
was
very
nice
alas
ursula
did
not
think
it
at
all
likely
that
this
would
ever
be
in
her
power
poor
mrs
copperhead
said
anne
as
they
made
their
way
along
the
crowded
street
where
it
was
difficult
for
them
to
walk
together
much
less
to
maintain
any
conversation
and
presently
ursula
keeping
as
close
as
possible
to
her
cousin
side
but
compelled
to
make
way
continually
for
other
lost
herself
in
a
maze
of
fancies
to
which
the
misty
afternoon
atmosphere
and
the
twinkling
lights
and
the
quickly
passing
crowds
lent
a
confused
but
not
unpleasing
background
she
was
glad
that
the
noise
made
all
talk
impossible
and
that
she
could
dream
on
quietly
as
they
glided
and
pressed
their
way
through
the
current
of
people
in
oxford
street
and
regent
street
as
undisturbed
as
if
she
had
been
shut
up
in
her
own
room
nay
more
so
for
the
external
sights
and
sounds
which
flitted
vaguely
by
her
disguised
those
dreams
even
from
herself
copperhead
had
once
been
poorer
than
she
was
a
poor
little
governess
what
if
somewhere
about
in
some
beautiful
house
with
just
such
a
carriage
at
the
door
a
beautiful
young
hero
should
be
waiting
who
would
give
all
those
dazzling
delights
to
ursula
then
what
frocks
she
would
buy
what
toys
what
ornaments
she
would
not
stop
at
the
girls
but
drive
to
the
best
tailor
boldly
and
bid
him
send
down
some
one
to
take
johnnie
measure
and
robin
and
even
reginald
and
then
she
would
go
to
the
and
to
the
bookseller
and
i
ca
tell
where
besides
and
finally
drive
down
in
the
fairy
chariot
laden
with
everything
that
was
delightful
to
the
very
door
she
would
not
go
in
any
vulgar
railway
she
would
keep
everything
in
her
own
possession
and
give
each
present
with
her
own
hands
a
crowning
delight
which
was
impossible
to
copperhead
and
how
clearly
she
seemed
to
see
herself
drawing
up
with
panting
horses
and
splendid
to
the
dull
door
of
the
poor
parsonage
where
scarcely
anything
better
than
a
ever
came
how
the
children
would
rush
to
the
window
and
even
papa
out
of
his
study
and
what
a
commotion
would
run
through
grange
lane
and
even
up
into
the
high
street
where
the
butcher
and
the
baker
would
remember
with
a
shiver
how
saucy
they
had
sometimes
been
when
they
saw
what
a
great
lady
she
was
a
dreamy
smile
hovered
upon
ursula
face
as
she
saw
all
the
little
scenes
of
this
little
drama
mixed
up
with
gleams
of
the
and
noises
of
the
streets
and
great
ghosts
of
passing
omnibuses
and
horses
steaming
in
the
frosty
air
how
many
girls
like
her
go
dreaming
about
the
prosaic
streets
it
was
not
perhaps
a
very
elevated
or
heroic
dream
but
the
visionary
chariot
full
of
fine
things
for
the
children
was
better
than
cinderella
pumpkin
carriage
or
many
another
chariot
of
romance
her
cousins
who
were
so
much
her
elders
and
who
shuddered
in
their
very
souls
at
the
thought
of
poor
copperhead
and
who
were
talking
earnestly
about
the
children
they
expected
next
morning
and
what
was
to
be
done
with
them
had
no
clue
to
thoughts
they
did
not
think
much
of
them
one
way
or
another
but
took
great
care
not
to
lose
her
from
their
side
and
that
she
should
not
be
frightened
by
the
crowding
which
after
all
was
the
great
matter
and
they
were
very
glad
to
get
back
to
the
comparative
quiet
of
suffolk
street
and
to
take
off
their
bonnets
and
take
their
cup
of
tea
but
ursula
for
her
part
was
sorry
when
the
walk
was
over
she
had
enjoyed
it
so
much
it
was
half
regent
street
and
half
carlingford
with
the
pleasure
of
both
mixed
up
together
and
she
was
half
little
ursula
may
with
her
head
in
the
air
and
half
that
very
great
lady
in
the
who
had
it
in
her
power
to
make
everybody
so
happy
between
poor
copperhead
who
was
the
most
miserable
frightened
little
slave
in
the
world
with
nothing
as
she
said
but
time
and
money
and
ursula
without
a
penny
and
who
always
had
so
much
to
do
what
a
gulf
there
was
a
gulf
however
which
fancy
could
bridge
over
so
easily
but
the
dream
was
broken
when
she
got
indoors
not
even
the
quiet
of
her
own
little
room
could
bring
back
in
all
their
glory
the
disturbed
images
that
had
floated
before
her
in
the
street
this
was
ursula
last
day
in
town
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
of
a
nature
without
any
aid
from
sophy
suggestion
to
put
a
great
many
ideas
into
her
mind
chapter
viii
the
dorsets
next
day
the
little
dorsets
came
an
odd
little
pair
of
shivering
babies
with
a
still
more
shivering
ayah
it
was
the
failing
health
of
the
little
exotic
creatures
endangered
by
their
english
blood
though
they
had
never
seen
england
and
talked
nothing
but
hindostanee
which
had
brought
them
home
at
this
inhospitable
time
of
the
year
and
to
get
the
rooms
warm
enough
for
them
became
the
entire
thought
of
the
anxious
aunts
who
contemplated
these
wan
babies
with
a
curious
mixture
of
emotions
anxious
to
be
very
fond
of
them
yet
feeling
difficulties
in
the
way
they
were
very
white
as
indian
children
so
often
are
with
big
blue
veins
meandering
over
them
distinct
as
if
traced
with
colour
they
were
frightened
by
all
the
novelty
round
them
and
the
strange
faces
whose
very
anxiety
increased
their
alarming
aspect
they
did
not
understand
more
than
a
few
words
of
english
and
shrank
back
in
a
little
heap
leaning
against
their
dark
nurse
and
clinging
to
her
when
their
new
relations
made
overtures
of
kindness
children
are
less
easily
conciliated
in
real
life
than
superficial
observers
suppose
the
obstinate
resistance
they
made
to
all
anne
dorset
attempts
to
win
their
confidence
was
enough
to
have
discouraged
the
most
patient
and
poor
anne
cried
over
her
failure
when
those
atoms
of
humanity
so
strangely
individual
and
distinct
in
their
utter
weakness
helplessness
and
dependence
were
carried
off
to
bed
gazing
distrustfully
at
her
still
with
big
blue
eyes
creatures
whom
any
moderately
strong
hand
could
have
crushed
like
flies
but
whose
little
minds
not
all
the
power
on
earth
could
command
or
move
strange
contrast
anne
cried
when
they
were
carried
off
to
bed
sir
robert
had
escaped
from
the
hot
room
which
stifled
him
long
before
and
sophy
half
angry
in
spite
of
herself
had
made
up
her
mind
to
take
no
notice
of
the
little
wretches
fancy
she
said
shrinking
at
anne
anne
of
all
people
in
the
world
there
is
not
a
little
puppy
or
kitten
but
knows
better
little
disagreeable
things
oh
love
them
why
should
i
love
them
they
are
john
children
i
believe
but
they
are
not
a
bit
like
him
they
must
be
like
their
mother
i
do
see
for
my
part
what
there
is
in
them
to
love
oh
much
sophy
said
anne
drying
her
eyes
they
are
our
own
flesh
and
blood
i
suppose
so
they
are
certainly
john
flesh
and
blood
at
least
they
are
not
a
bit
like
us
and
i
can
not
love
them
for
being
like
her
can
i
whom
i
never
saw
the
illogicality
of
this
curious
argument
did
not
strike
anne
i
hope
they
will
get
to
like
us
she
said
poor
little
darlings
everything
strange
about
them
new
faces
and
places
i
do
wonder
that
they
are
frightened
and
cry
when
any
one
comes
near
them
we
must
trust
to
time
if
they
only
knew
how
i
want
to
love
them
to
pet
them
i
am
going
to
help
little
ursula
with
her
packing
said
sophy
hastily
and
she
hurried
to
ursula
room
where
all
was
in
disorder
and
threw
herself
down
in
a
chair
by
the
fire
anne
is
too
good
to
live
she
cried
she
makes
me
angry
with
her
goodness
little
things
like
nobody
i
know
of
certainly
not
like
our
family
shrinking
away
and
clinging
to
that
black
woman
as
if
anne
was
an
ogre
why
a
little
dog
knows
better
as
i
said
before
i
do
think
they
are
very
pretty
children
said
ursula
not
knowing
how
to
reply
why
should
we
be
supposed
to
be
fond
of
them
said
sophy
who
was
relieving
her
own
mind
not
expecting
any
help
from
ursula
the
whole
question
of
children
is
one
that
puzzles
me
a
little
helpless
wax
image
that
does
not
know
you
that
ca
respond
to
you
and
wo
perhaps
when
it
can
that
has
nothing
interesting
in
it
that
is
not
amusing
like
a
kitten
or
even
pretty
well
let
us
suppose
the
people
it
belongs
to
like
it
by
instinct
but
the
rest
of
the
world
oh
cousin
sophy
cried
ursula
her
eyes
round
with
alarm
and
horror
you
think
i
ought
to
be
fond
of
them
because
they
are
my
children
we
are
not
always
very
fond
even
of
our
brothers
ursula
do
scream
at
your
age
it
is
different
but
when
they
marry
and
have
separate
interests
if
these
mites
go
on
looking
at
me
with
those
big
scared
eyes
as
if
they
expected
me
to
box
their
ears
i
shall
do
it
some
day
i
know
i
shall
instead
of
going
on
my
knees
to
them
like
anne
to
curry
favour
if
they
had
been
like
our
family
why
that
would
have
been
some
attraction
are
you
pleased
to
go
home
or
would
you
prefer
to
stay
here
in
london
said
ursula
with
a
breath
her
hands
involuntarily
clasping
each
other
oh
i
hope
you
wo
think
me
very
silly
but
i
do
like
london
yes
i
am
pleased
i
have
so
many
presents
to
take
to
them
thanks
to
you
and
to
cousin
anne
and
to
copperhead
i
am
ashamed
to
be
carrying
away
so
much
but
carlingford
is
not
like
london
she
added
with
a
sigh
no
it
is
a
pretty
soft
friendly
country
place
not
a
great
wilderness
oh
cousin
sophy
my
poor
little
innocent
girl
do
you
think
it
is
desolate
and
this
great
sea
of
people
who
none
of
them
care
one
straw
for
you
i
have
seen
nothing
but
kindness
said
ursula
with
a
little
heat
of
virtuous
indignation
there
is
you
and
copperhead
and
even
the
gentlemen
were
kind
or
at
least
they
meant
to
be
kind
the
gentlemen
said
sophy
amused
do
you
mean
the
copperheads
clarence
perhaps
he
is
coming
to
easton
ursula
shall
i
bring
him
into
carlingford
to
see
you
if
you
please
cousin
sophy
said
the
girl
simply
she
had
not
been
thinking
any
thoughts
of
the
gentlemen
which
could
make
her
blush
but
somehow
her
cousin
tone
jarred
upon
her
and
she
turned
round
to
her
packing
the
room
was
littered
with
the
things
which
she
was
putting
into
her
box
that
box
which
had
grown
a
great
deal
too
small
now
though
it
was
quite
roomy
enough
when
ursula
left
home
ursula
i
think
you
are
a
good
little
thing
on
the
whole
oh
cousin
sophy
forgive
me
no
i
am
not
good
forgive
you
for
what
yes
you
are
on
the
whole
a
good
little
thing
not
a
saint
like
anne
but
then
you
have
perhaps
more
to
try
your
temper
we
were
always
very
obedient
to
her
though
we
worried
her
and
papa
always
believed
in
her
with
all
his
heart
perhaps
you
have
more
to
put
up
with
but
my
dear
think
of
poor
copperhead
for
example
why
do
you
always
call
her
poor
copperhead
she
is
very
rich
she
can
make
other
people
happy
when
she
pleases
she
has
a
beautiful
house
and
everything
and
a
bear
a
brute
of
a
husband
ah
does
she
mind
very
much
asked
ursula
with
composure
this
drawback
seemed
to
her
insignificant
in
comparison
with
copperhead
greatness
it
was
only
sophy
laugh
that
brought
her
to
herself
she
said
with
some
haste
putting
in
her
dresses
with
her
back
turned
i
do
not
mean
to
say
anything
silly
when
people
are
as
old
as
she
is
do
they
mind
it
can
not
matter
so
much
what
happens
when
you
are
old
why
but
never
mind
the
theory
is
as
good
as
many
others
said
sophy
you
would
not
mind
then
marrying
a
man
like
that
to
have
everything
that
your
heart
could
desire
cousin
sophy
i
am
not
going
to
marry
any
one
said
ursula
loftily
carrying
her
head
erect
i
hope
i
am
not
like
that
thinking
of
such
things
i
am
very
very
sorry
that
you
should
have
such
an
opinion
of
me
after
living
together
ten
days
she
turned
away
with
all
the
forlorn
pride
of
injury
and
there
were
tears
in
her
voice
sophy
who
dared
not
laugh
in
reply
to
make
the
young
heroine
more
angry
hastened
to
apologize
it
was
a
silly
question
she
said
i
have
a
very
good
opinion
of
you
ursula
ten
days
is
a
long
time
and
i
know
you
as
if
we
had
been
together
all
your
life
i
am
sure
you
do
not
think
anything
a
nice
girl
ought
not
to
think
but
i
hope
you
will
never
be
deceived
and
persuaded
to
marry
any
one
who
is
like
copperhead
i
mean
who
is
not
nice
and
young
and
good
like
yourself
oh
no
cried
the
girl
with
energy
but
most
likely
i
shall
not
marry
any
one
she
added
with
a
half
sigh
janey
may
but
the
eldest
has
so
much
to
do
and
so
much
to
think
of
cousin
anne
has
never
married
nor
cousin
sophy
either
sophy
laugh
sounded
hard
to
the
girl
never
mind
you
will
not
be
like
us
you
will
marry
most
likely
a
clergyman
in
a
pretty
parsonage
in
the
country
i
do
not
think
i
am
very
fond
of
clergymen
said
ursula
recovering
her
ease
and
composure
they
are
always
in
and
about
and
everything
has
to
be
kept
so
quiet
when
they
are
studying
and
then
the
parish
people
are
always
coming
tramping
upstairs
with
their
dirty
feet
when
you
have
only
one
servant
it
is
very
very
troublesome
sir
robert
never
gives
any
trouble
she
said
once
more
with
a
soft
little
sigh
papa
said
sophy
somewhat
surprised
but
you
would
not
she
was
going
to
say
marry
papa
but
when
she
looked
at
ursula
innocent
gravity
her
absolute
unconsciousness
of
the
meanings
which
her
chance
words
might
bear
she
refrained
i
think
i
must
send
seton
to
help
you
she
said
you
can
not
get
through
all
that
packing
by
yourself
oh
yes
i
am
not
tired
i
have
put
in
all
my
old
things
the
rest
are
your
presents
oh
cousin
sophy
said
the
girl
coming
quickly
to
her
and
stealing
two
arms
round
her
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
as
if
it
was
not
enough
to
give
me
this
holiday
the
most
delightful
i
ever
had
in
my
life
to
send
me
home
loaded
with
all
these
beautiful
things
i
shall
never
forget
it
never
never
if
i
were
to
live
a
hundred
years
my
dear
cried
sophy
startled
by
the
sudden
energy
of
this
embrace
sophy
was
not
emotional
but
her
eyes
moistened
and
her
voice
softened
in
spite
of
herself
but
you
must
let
me
send
seton
to
you
she
said
hurrying
away
she
was
excited
by
the
day
events
and
did
not
trust
herself
to
make
any
further
response
for
if
she
gave
way
at
all
who
could
tell
how
far
the
giving
way
might
go
her
brother
john
had
been
married
at
the
time
when
sophy
too
ought
to
have
been
married
had
all
gone
well
and
perhaps
some
thought
that
she
too
might
have
had
little
children
belonging
to
her
had
given
force
and
sharpness
to
her
objections
to
the
pale
little
distrustful
indian
children
who
had
shrunk
from
her
overtures
of
affection
she
went
to
her
room
and
bathed
her
eyes
which
were
hot
and
painful
and
then
she
went
back
to
anne
in
the
who
had
opened
the
window
to
reduce
the
temperature
and
was
resting
in
an
easy
chair
and
pondering
what
she
could
do
to
make
the
children
love
her
and
to
be
a
mother
to
them
in
the
absence
of
john
i
have
been
talking
to
ursula
who
is
always
refreshing
said
sophy
i
wonder
whom
that
child
will
marry
she
gave
me
to
understand
in
her
awkward
innocent
way
that
she
preferred
papa
a
laugh
does
one
good
sophy
added
slightly
rubbing
her
eyes
anne
made
no
immediate
answer
she
scarcely
heard
indeed
what
her
sister
said
i
think
we
shall
get
on
after
a
while
she
said
softly
they
said
their
prayers
very
prettily
poor
darlings
and
let
me
kiss
them
without
crying
after
a
while
we
shall
get
on
i
do
fear
anne
cried
sophy
you
are
too
much
for
mere
human
nature
you
are
too
bad
or
too
good
for
anything
i
begin
to
hate
these
little
wretches
when
i
hear
you
speak
of
them
so
hush
said
anne
i
know
you
do
mean
it
easton
will
be
very
strange
to
them
at
first
i
could
not
go
to
india
for
my
part
a
crust
of
bread
at
home
would
be
better
think
of
parting
with
your
children
just
when
they
come
to
an
age
to
understand
john
i
suppose
did
not
take
children
into
consideration
when
he
went
away
you
speak
as
if
children
were
all
one
life
a
great
part
of
it
said
anne
gently
no
dear
i
am
not
clever
like
you
and
perhaps
it
is
what
you
will
call
a
low
view
but
after
all
it
runs
through
everything
the
flowers
are
used
for
the
seed
and
everything
in
the
world
is
intended
to
keep
the
world
going
yes
even
i
that
is
the
good
of
me
i
shall
never
be
a
mother
but
what
does
that
matter
there
are
so
many
children
left
on
the
world
whom
somebody
must
bring
up
and
who
are
brought
to
you
when
they
need
you
and
taken
from
you
when
they
need
you
no
longer
said
sophy
indignantly
you
are
left
to
bear
the
trouble
others
have
the
recompense
it
is
so
in
this
world
my
dear
all
the
way
down
from
god
himself
always
looking
for
reward
is
mean
and
mercenary
when
we
do
nothing
when
we
are
of
no
use
what
a
poor
thing
life
is
said
anne
with
a
little
colour
rising
in
her
cheeks
not
worth
having
i
think
we
have
only
a
right
to
our
existence
when
we
are
doing
something
and
i
have
my
wages
i
like
to
be
of
a
little
consequence
she
said
laughing
nobody
is
of
any
consequence
who
does
not
do
something
in
that
case
the
ayah
the
housemaid
is
of
more
consequence
than
you
so
be
it
i
do
object
said
anne
but
i
do
think
so
for
they
have
to
be
directed
and
guided
to
be
without
a
housemaid
is
dreadful
the
moment
you
think
of
that
you
see
how
important
the
people
who
work
are
everything
comes
to
a
without
mary
whereas
there
are
ladies
whose
absence
would
make
no
difference
i
for
instance
you
are
very
unkind
to
say
so
sophy
all
the
same
if
you
were
to
do
more
you
would
be
happier
my
dear
to
do
what
go
on
my
knees
to
those
wax
dolls
and
entreat
them
to
let
me
pet
them
and
make
idols
of
them
as
you
will
do
well
how
are
you
getting
on
now
said
sir
robert
coming
in
ah
i
see
you
have
the
window
open
but
the
room
is
still
very
warm
when
they
get
to
easton
they
will
have
their
own
rooms
of
course
i
want
to
reflect
upon
john
but
it
is
rather
a
burden
this
he
has
saddled
us
with
john
mother
is
living
is
she
i
think
something
might
have
been
at
least
on
her
part
some
offer
to
take
her
share
sophy
gave
her
sister
a
malicious
glance
but
promptly
changed
her
tone
and
took
up
her
position
in
defence
of
the
arrangement
with
that
ease
which
is
natural
in
a
family
question
of
course
she
said
your
grandchildren
dorsets
and
the
heir
probably
as
robert
has
no
boy
could
go
nowhere
papa
but
to
us
it
may
be
a
bore
but
at
least
john
showed
so
much
sense
for
nothing
else
could
be
john
does
not
show
very
much
sense
in
an
ordinary
way
what
did
he
want
with
a
wife
and
children
at
his
age
the
boy
is
five
is
he
and
the
father
only
thirty
absurd
i
did
not
marry
till
i
was
thirty
though
i
had
succeeded
before
that
time
and
was
the
only
son
and
the
head
of
the
family
john
was
always
an
ass
said
sir
robert
with
a
crossness
which
sprang
chiefly
from
the
fact
that
the
temperature
of
the
room
was
higher
than
usual
and
the
habits
of
his
evening
interfered
with
he
was
capable
of
sacrificing
something
of
much
more
importance
to
his
family
but
scarcely
of
sacrificing
his
comfort
which
is
the
last
and
most
painful
of
efforts
that
may
be
very
true
said
sophy
but
all
the
same
it
is
only
right
that
the
children
should
be
with
us
john
people
are
not
well
off
her
mother
has
a
large
family
of
her
own
the
little
things
would
have
been
spoiled
or
they
would
have
been
neglected
and
after
all
they
are
dorsets
though
they
are
not
like
john
well
well
i
suppose
you
are
right
said
sir
robert
grumbling
and
thank
heaven
we
shall
be
at
home
anne
had
scarcely
said
a
word
though
it
was
she
who
was
most
deeply
concerned
about
the
children
she
gave
her
sister
a
hug
when
sir
robert
relapsed
into
the
evening
paper
and
then
stole
upstairs
to
look
at
the
poor
babies
as
they
lay
asleep
she
was
not
a
mother
and
never
would
be
people
indeed
called
her
an
old
maid
and
with
reason
enough
though
she
was
little
over
thirty
for
had
she
been
seventy
she
could
not
have
been
more
unlikely
to
marry
it
was
not
her
vocation
she
had
plenty
to
do
in
the
world
without
that
and
was
satisfied
with
her
life
the
sad
reflection
that
the
children
whom
she
tended
were
not
her
own
did
not
visit
her
mind
as
perhaps
it
had
visited
sophy
making
her
angry
through
the
very
yearning
of
nature
anne
was
of
a
different
temperament
she
said
a
little
prayer
softly
in
her
heart
for
the
children
and
for
her
sister
as
she
stooped
over
the
small
beds
god
bless
the
children
and
oh
make
my
sophy
happy
she
said
she
had
never
asked
for
nor
thought
of
happiness
to
herself
it
had
come
to
her
unconsciously
in
her
occupations
in
her
duties
as
natural
as
the
soft
daylight
and
as
little
sought
after
but
sophy
was
different
sophy
wanted
material
for
happiness
something
to
make
her
glad
she
did
not
possess
it
like
her
sister
in
the
quiet
of
her
own
heart
and
from
the
children
room
anne
went
to
ursula
where
the
girl
tired
with
her
packing
was
brushing
her
pretty
hair
out
before
she
went
to
bed
everything
was
ready
the
drawers
all
empty
the
box
full
to
overflowing
and
supplemented
by
a
large
parcel
in
brown
paper
and
what
with
the
fatigue
and
the
tumult
of
feeling
in
her
simple
soul
ursula
was
ready
to
cry
when
her
cousin
came
in
and
sat
down
beside
her
i
have
been
so
happy
cousin
anne
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
she
said
my
dear
everybody
will
be
good
to
you
said
miss
dorset
so
long
as
you
trust
everybody
ursula
people
are
more
good
than
bad
i
hope
when
you
come
to
easton
you
will
be
still
happier
ursula
demurred
a
little
to
this
though
she
was
too
shy
to
say
much
town
is
so
cheerful
she
said
it
was
not
sir
robert
way
of
looking
at
affairs
there
is
very
little
difference
in
places
said
anne
when
your
heart
is
light
you
are
happy
everywhere
ursula
felt
that
it
was
somewhat
derogatory
to
her
dignity
to
have
her
enjoyment
set
down
to
the
score
of
a
light
heart
but
against
such
an
assertion
what
could
she
say
chapter
ix
coming
home
the
party
which
set
out
from
suffolk
street
next
morning
was
a
mighty
one
there
were
the
children
the
ayah
the
new
nurse
whom
anne
had
engaged
in
town
to
take
charge
of
her
little
nephews
as
soon
as
they
got
accustomed
to
their
new
life
and
seton
the
ancient
whom
the
sisters
shared
between
them
and
sir
robert
man
not
to
speak
of
sir
robert
himself
and
the
miss
dorsets
and
ursula
easton
was
within
a
dozen
miles
of
carlingford
so
that
they
all
travelled
together
as
far
as
that
town
the
dorset
party
went
farther
on
to
the
next
station
from
which
they
had
still
six
miles
to
travel
by
carriage
they
set
down
ursula
on
the
platform
with
her
box
and
her
parcel
and
took
leave
of
her
and
swept
out
of
the
station
again
leaving
her
rather
forlorn
and
solitary
among
the
crowd
disgraceful
of
may
not
to
send
some
one
to
meet
the
child
i
suppose
he
knew
she
was
coming
said
sir
robert
and
ursula
had
something
of
the
same
feeling
as
she
stood
looking
wistfully
about
her
but
as
soon
as
the
train
was
gone
her
name
was
called
in
a
somewhat
voice
and
turning
round
she
found
herself
hugged
by
janey
while
johnnie
fresh
from
school
seized
her
bag
out
of
her
hand
by
way
of
showing
his
satisfaction
we
did
come
up
till
we
could
make
sure
that
the
dorsets
were
out
of
the
way
said
janey
and
oh
is
it
really
you
i
am
so
glad
to
get
you
home
why
did
you
want
to
see
the
dorsets
they
are
the
kindest
friends
we
have
in
the
world
said
ursula
how
is
papa
is
he
in
a
good
humour
and
the
rest
why
did
not
some
more
come
to
meet
me
i
made
sure
there
would
be
four
at
least
amy
and
robin
have
gone
out
to
tea
they
did
want
to
go
but
papa
insisted
oh
he
is
very
well
on
the
whole
and
reginald
is
at
home
of
course
but
i
thought
you
would
like
me
best
johnnie
came
to
carry
the
bag
said
janey
with
a
natural
contempt
for
her
younger
brother
what
a
big
parcel
you
must
have
been
getting
quantities
of
presents
or
else
you
must
have
packed
very
badly
for
i
am
sure
there
was
lots
of
room
in
the
trunk
when
you
went
away
oh
janey
if
you
only
knew
what
i
have
got
there
what
said
janey
with
quiet
but
composed
interest
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
she
could
have
any
individual
concern
in
the
contents
of
the
parcels
she
was
a
tall
girl
who
had
outgrown
all
her
frocks
or
rather
did
outgrow
them
periodically
with
dark
elf
locks
about
her
shoulders
which
would
not
curl
or
or
do
anything
that
hair
ought
to
do
she
had
her
thoughts
always
in
the
clouds
forming
all
sorts
of
impossible
plans
as
was
natural
to
her
age
and
was
just
the
kind
of
angular
jerky
very
well
intentioned
but
very
maladroit
who
is
a
greater
nuisance
to
herself
and
everybody
else
than
even
a
which
is
saying
a
good
deal
things
broke
in
her
hands
as
they
never
broke
in
anybody
else
stuffs
tore
furniture
fell
to
the
ground
as
she
passed
by
ursula
carefully
kept
her
off
the
parcel
and
gave
it
to
johnnie
one
of
the
railway
porters
when
all
the
rest
of
the
passengers
were
disposed
of
condescended
to
carry
her
trunk
and
thus
they
set
out
on
their
way
home
the
parsonage
was
close
to
roque
at
the
other
end
of
grange
lane
they
had
to
walk
all
the
way
down
that
genteel
and
quiet
suburban
road
by
the
garden
walls
over
which
at
this
season
no
scent
of
flowers
came
or
blossomed
branches
hung
forth
there
were
red
visible
and
upon
one
mossy
old
tree
a
gray
bunch
of
mistletoe
could
be
seen
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
but
how
quiet
it
was
they
scarcely
met
a
dozen
people
between
the
station
and
roque
oh
janey
is
everybody
dead
said
ursula
how
dull
it
is
you
should
see
london
ursula
said
janey
firmly
once
for
all
i
am
not
going
to
stand
this
london
a
nasty
smoky
muddy
place
no
more
like
carlingford
than
i
am
like
you
you
forget
i
have
been
in
london
you
are
not
speaking
to
ignorant
ears
said
janey
drawing
herself
up
and
your
letters
were
quite
bad
enough
you
are
not
going
to
talk
of
nothing
but
your
disagreeable
london
here
talk
to
people
who
have
never
seen
it
said
the
girl
elevating
her
shoulders
with
the
contempt
of
knowledge
that
time
you
were
at
the
dentist
said
ursula
and
call
that
seeing
london
cousin
anne
and
cousin
sophy
took
me
everywhere
we
went
to
drive
in
the
park
we
went
to
the
museum
and
the
national
gallery
and
oh
janey
listen
we
went
to
the
theatre
think
of
that
well
i
should
like
to
go
to
the
theatre
said
janey
with
a
sigh
but
you
told
me
in
your
letter
that
what
comes
of
being
the
eldest
unless
you
get
married
or
something
nobody
will
ever
think
of
taking
you
are
five
years
younger
than
i
am
said
ursula
with
dignity
naturally
people
do
think
of
a
girl
at
your
age
you
must
wait
till
you
are
older
as
i
have
had
to
do
janey
guess
what
is
in
your
new
dress
your
if
it
is
crumpled
as
you
said
you
ca
have
danced
very
much
i
know
my
dress
will
be
in
tatters
if
i
ever
go
to
a
ball
i
danced
as
much
as
i
wished
i
did
not
know
many
people
said
ursula
drawing
herself
up
of
course
at
this
time
of
the
year
nobody
is
in
town
and
we
hardly
knew
any
one
and
of
course
of
course
you
only
knew
the
fashionable
people
who
are
out
of
town
in
winter
cried
janey
with
a
laugh
which
echoed
along
the
street
ursula
had
not
come
home
from
london
to
be
laughed
at
by
her
younger
sister
she
who
had
been
petted
by
the
dorsets
and
whose
opinion
even
sir
robert
had
asked
on
various
occasions
she
felt
this
downfall
all
the
more
deeply
that
she
had
been
looking
forward
to
so
many
long
talks
with
janey
and
expected
to
live
all
her
brief
ten
days
holiday
over
again
and
to
instruct
her
young
sister
mind
by
the
many
experiences
acquired
in
that
momentous
time
poor
ursula
ten
days
is
quite
long
enough
to
form
habits
at
her
age
and
she
had
been
taken
care
of
as
young
ladies
are
taken
care
of
in
society
accompanied
or
attended
wherever
she
went
and
made
much
of
to
find
herself
thus
left
to
arrive
and
get
home
as
she
pleased
with
nobody
but
janey
to
meet
her
was
a
terrible
and
to
be
laughed
at
by
janey
was
the
last
step
of
all
tears
filled
her
eyes
she
turned
her
shoulder
to
her
companion
averting
her
head
and
this
was
all
poor
ursula
had
to
look
to
the
dreary
carlingford
street
papa
finding
fault
everything
going
wrong
and
janey
laughing
at
her
to
be
cousin
anne
maid
or
governess
to
the
little
indian
children
would
be
better
than
this
for
five
minutes
more
she
walked
on
in
offended
silence
saying
nothing
though
janey
like
the
she
was
made
frequent
use
of
her
elbow
to
move
her
sister
ursula
the
girl
said
at
last
with
a
more
potent
nudge
what
the
matter
wo
you
speak
to
me
and
janey
who
had
her
own
disappointment
too
and
had
expected
to
be
received
with
enthusiasm
burst
out
crying
regardless
of
appearances
in
the
middle
of
the
street
janey
for
heaven
sake
people
will
see
you
i
am
sure
it
is
i
who
should
cry
not
you
said
ursula
in
sudden
distress
i
do
care
who
sees
me
sobbed
janey
you
have
been
enjoying
yourself
while
we
have
stayed
at
home
and
instead
of
being
pleased
to
come
back
or
glad
to
see
us
oh
how
can
you
be
so
she
said
with
a
fresh
burst
of
tears
here
the
other
side
of
the
question
suddenly
dawned
upon
ursula
she
had
been
enjoying
herself
while
the
others
stayed
at
home
it
was
quite
true
instead
of
feeling
the
shock
of
difference
she
should
have
thought
of
those
who
had
never
been
so
lucky
as
she
was
who
had
never
seen
anything
out
of
carlingford
do
be
so
foolish
janey
she
said
i
glad
and
i
have
brought
you
such
beautiful
presents
but
when
you
do
nothing
but
laugh
i
am
sure
i
did
laugh
to
hurt
i
only
laughed
for
fun
cried
janey
drying
her
eyes
not
without
a
little
indignation
and
thus
peace
was
made
for
indeed
one
was
dying
to
tell
all
that
happened
and
the
other
dying
to
hear
they
walked
the
rest
of
the
way
with
their
heads
very
close
together
so
absorbed
that
the
eldest
brother
coming
out
of
the
gate
as
they
approached
stood
looking
at
them
with
a
smile
on
his
face
for
some
time
before
they
saw
him
a
slight
young
man
not
very
tall
with
dark
hair
like
ursula
and
a
somewhat
anxious
expression
in
correct
english
clerical
dress
has
it
all
begun
already
he
said
when
they
came
close
up
to
him
but
without
perceiving
him
ursula
face
inspired
with
the
pleasure
of
talking
as
janey
was
with
the
eager
delight
of
listening
the
house
was
built
in
the
ecclesiastical
style
with
gables
and
mullioned
windows
which
excluded
the
light
at
least
whether
or
not
they
inspired
with
a
sense
of
correct
art
as
they
were
intended
to
do
it
was
next
door
to
the
church
and
had
a
narrow
strip
of
shrubbery
in
front
planted
with
somewhat
gloomy
evergreens
the
gate
and
door
stood
always
open
except
when
may
himself
coming
or
going
closed
them
momentarily
and
it
can
not
be
denied
that
there
were
outward
and
visible
signs
of
a
large
somewhat
unruly
family
inside
oh
reginald
cried
ursula
you
have
come
home
yes
for
good
he
said
with
a
or
for
bad
who
can
tell
at
all
events
here
i
am
why
should
it
be
for
bad
cried
janey
whose
voice
was
always
audible
up
the
street
oh
ursula
something
very
nice
has
happened
he
is
to
be
warden
of
the
old
college
fancy
that
being
provided
for
papa
says
and
a
beautiful
old
house
warden
of
the
old
college
i
thought
it
was
always
some
old
person
who
was
chosen
but
papa
says
he
can
live
at
home
and
let
the
house
cried
janey
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
be
an
old
gentleman
papa
thinks
it
is
nice
because
there
is
no
work
but
look
at
reginald
he
does
not
like
it
a
bit
he
is
never
satisfied
i
am
sure
i
wish
it
was
me
come
in
said
reginald
hastily
i
do
want
all
my
affairs
and
my
character
besides
to
be
proclaimed
from
the
janey
stopped
indignant
to
make
some
reply
and
ursula
grasping
her
arm
as
she
feared
with
an
energetic
pinch
went
in
quickly
little
amy
had
been
playing
in
the
little
square
hall
which
was
strewed
with
clothes
and
with
two
or
three
dolls
in
various
stages
of
dilapidation
some
old
ragged
lay
in
a
corner
the
leaves
out
of
one
of
which
were
blowing
about
in
the
wind
even
ten
days
of
anne
orderly
reign
had
opened
ursula
eyes
to
these
imperfections
oh
what
a
muddle
she
cried
i
do
wonder
that
reginald
does
not
care
for
living
at
home
oh
i
wish
papa
heard
you
cried
janey
loudly
as
ursula
led
the
way
into
the
which
was
not
much
tidier
than
the
hall
there
was
a
of
stockings
to
be
mended
standing
on
the
old
ursula
felt
with
a
sinking
of
the
heart
that
they
were
waiting
for
her
arrival
and
that
janey
had
done
nothing
to
them
more
toys
and
more
old
were
tossed
about
upon
the
faded
old
carpet
the
hung
uneven
one
end
of
it
dragging
upon
the
floor
the
fire
was
burning
very
low
stifled
in
dust
and
white
ashes
how
dismal
it
looked
not
like
a
place
to
come
home
to
oh
i
wonder
reginald
is
vexed
to
be
made
to
live
at
home
she
said
once
again
to
herself
with
tears
in
her
eyes
i
hope
you
have
enjoyed
yourself
her
brother
said
as
she
dropped
wearily
into
the
old
we
have
missed
you
very
much
but
i
do
suppose
you
missed
us
london
was
very
pleasant
i
suppose
even
at
this
time
of
the
year
oh
pleasant
said
ursula
if
you
had
been
with
me
how
you
would
have
liked
it
suffolk
street
is
only
an
inn
but
it
is
a
very
nice
inn
what
they
call
a
private
hotel
far
better
than
the
great
big
places
on
the
american
principle
sir
robert
says
but
we
dined
at
one
of
those
big
places
one
day
and
it
was
very
amusing
scores
of
people
and
great
mirrors
that
made
them
look
hundreds
and
such
quantities
of
lights
and
servants
but
sir
robert
thought
suffolk
street
very
much
the
best
and
i
went
to
two
theatres
and
to
a
ball
they
were
so
kind
sophy
dorset
laughs
at
me
sometimes
but
anne
is
an
angel
said
ursula
fervently
i
never
knew
any
one
so
good
in
my
life
that
is
not
saying
much
said
janey
for
none
of
us
are
very
good
and
you
know
nobody
else
anne
dorset
is
an
old
maid
oh
janey
how
dare
you
and
for
that
matter
so
is
sophy
papa
says
so
he
says
she
was
jilted
and
that
she
will
never
get
a
husband
hold
your
tongue
said
reginald
fiercely
if
we
are
to
hear
what
my
father
says
at
second
hand
through
an
imp
like
you
oh
yes
said
janey
mocking
that
is
because
you
are
not
friends
with
papa
janey
come
and
help
me
to
take
off
my
things
said
ursula
seeing
that
reginald
would
probably
proceed
to
strong
measures
and
box
his
sister
ears
if
you
were
older
you
would
not
talk
like
that
she
said
with
dignity
as
they
went
upstairs
oh
dear
janey
you
think
how
different
cousin
anne
and
sophy
are
who
are
not
girls
like
us
they
never
talk
unkindly
of
other
people
you
would
get
to
think
it
childish
as
i
do
if
you
had
been
living
with
cousin
anne
stuff
said
janey
papa
is
not
childish
i
hope
and
it
was
he
who
said
all
that
i
do
care
what
your
fine
cousin
anne
does
notwithstanding
the
reproof
thus
administered
went
to
janey
heart
for
to
a
girl
of
fifteen
whose
next
sister
is
almost
twenty
the
reproach
of
being
childish
is
worse
than
any
other
she
blushed
and
though
she
scoffed
was
moved
besides
though
it
suited
her
to
quote
him
for
the
moment
she
was
very
far
from
putting
any
unbounded
faith
in
papa
just
wait
a
moment
see
what
cousin
anne
whom
you
think
so
little
of
has
sent
you
said
ursula
sitting
down
on
the
floor
with
the
great
parcel
in
her
lap
carefully
undoing
the
knots
for
she
had
read
miss
edgeworth
stories
in
her
youth
and
would
not
have
cut
the
strings
for
the
world
and
when
the
new
dresses
in
all
their
gloss
and
softness
were
spread
out
upon
the
old
carpet
which
scarcely
retained
one
trace
of
colour
janey
was
struck
dumb
is
that
she
said
faltering
and
for
this
is
for
you
though
you
think
them
old
maids
and
that
they
will
never
get
husbands
said
ursula
indignantly
what
a
thing
for
a
girl
to
say
and
indeed
i
do
think
cousin
anne
will
ever
get
a
husband
there
is
not
one
in
the
world
half
good
enough
for
her
not
one
yes
this
is
for
you
they
went
themselves
and
looked
over
half
the
things
in
the
shop
before
they
could
get
one
to
please
them
they
did
not
say
is
an
unkind
little
thing
that
will
repeat
all
she
hears
about
us
and
does
not
care
for
us
a
bit
they
said
we
must
choose
frocks
for
janey
and
amy
come
and
help
us
to
get
what
they
will
like
best
janey
lips
quivered
and
two
very
big
tears
came
into
her
eyes
she
was
stricken
with
the
deepest
compunction
but
her
pride
did
not
permit
her
to
give
in
all
at
once
i
dare
say
you
told
her
how
badly
off
we
were
she
said
i
told
her
nothing
about
it
and
she
did
not
say
a
word
not
a
word
as
if
it
were
a
charity
only
to
please
you
to
let
you
see
that
you
were
remembered
but
i
dare
say
it
is
quite
true
after
all
said
ursula
with
lofty
irony
that
cousin
anne
will
never
get
a
husband
and
that
they
are
old
maids
oh
you
know
i
did
mean
it
said
janey
giving
way
to
her
tears
then
ursula
got
up
and
took
off
her
hat
and
smoothed
her
hair
feeling
satisfied
with
her
success
and
went
downstairs
again
to
reginald
who
was
seated
on
the
dingy
sofa
waiting
for
her
to
answer
her
questions
about
the
great
event
which
had
happened
since
she
had
been
away
ursula
mind
was
full
of
the
shock
of
the
sharp
impression
made
by
her
return
though
the
impression
itself
began
to
wear
away
i
can
understand
why
you
do
care
about
living
at
home
she
said
oh
i
wonder
if
i
could
do
anything
to
mend
it
i
am
so
glad
you
have
got
something
reginald
if
you
have
a
good
servant
you
might
be
quite
comfortable
by
yourself
and
we
could
come
and
see
you
i
should
not
feel
it
a
bit
not
a
single
bit
and
it
would
be
so
much
nicer
for
you
you
are
mistaken
said
her
brother
it
is
not
staying
at
home
i
object
to
we
are
not
very
tidy
or
very
comfortable
perhaps
but
we
all
belong
to
each
other
at
least
it
is
not
that
ursula
what
is
it
then
janey
says
said
ursula
drawing
a
long
breath
of
awe
and
admiration
that
you
are
to
have
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
for
doing
nothing
he
said
for
doing
nothing
she
looked
up
at
him
a
little
bewildered
for
his
tone
struck
ursula
as
not
at
all
corresponding
with
the
delightful
character
of
the
words
he
said
but
reginald
how
nice
how
very
nice
it
sounds
how
lucky
you
must
have
been
how
could
it
happen
that
such
a
delightful
thing
should
come
to
one
of
us
we
are
always
so
unlucky
papa
says
if
you
think
this
luck
said
reginald
he
does
and
he
is
quite
pleased
but
how
do
you
suppose
i
can
be
pleased
thrust
into
a
place
where
i
am
not
wanted
where
i
can
be
of
no
use
a
dummy
a
practical
falsehood
how
can
i
accept
it
ursula
i
tell
you
it
is
a
sinecure
ursula
looked
at
him
with
eyes
round
with
wonder
he
seemed
to
be
speaking
in
some
different
language
of
which
she
understood
nothing
what
is
a
sinecure
she
said
chapter
papa
ursula
has
come
back
cried
the
little
ones
who
had
returned
from
their
running
to
meet
their
father
at
the
door
may
was
very
good
except
by
moments
to
his
younger
children
he
was
not
indeed
an
unkind
father
to
any
of
them
but
he
had
never
forgiven
providence
for
leaving
him
with
his
motherless
family
upon
his
hands
a
man
so
utterly
unfit
for
the
task
perhaps
he
did
not
put
this
exactly
into
words
but
he
felt
it
deeply
and
had
never
got
over
it
there
were
so
many
things
that
he
could
have
done
better
and
there
were
so
many
people
who
could
have
done
this
better
and
yet
it
was
precisely
to
him
not
a
person
adapted
to
the
charge
of
children
that
it
had
been
given
to
do
it
this
seemed
to
argue
a
want
of
judgment
in
the
regulation
of
mortal
affairs
which
irritated
him
all
the
more
because
he
was
a
clergyman
and
had
to
persuade
other
people
that
everything
that
happened
to
them
was
for
the
best
he
was
a
man
of
some
culture
and
literary
power
and
wrote
very
pleasant
thoughtful
papers
for
some
of
the
church
magazines
but
these
compositions
though
very
easy
to
read
were
only
brought
into
the
world
by
elaborate
precautions
on
the
part
of
the
family
which
scarcely
dared
to
speak
above
its
breath
when
papa
was
writing
for
on
such
occasions
he
could
be
very
savage
as
the
occasional
offender
knew
he
was
a
man
with
an
imposing
person
and
of
very
bland
and
delightful
manners
when
he
chose
but
yet
he
had
never
made
friends
and
was
now
at
the
incumbent
of
roque
with
a
small
income
and
a
humble
position
in
the
church
hierarchy
of
carlingford
he
preached
better
than
any
other
of
the
carlingford
clergymen
looked
better
had
more
reputation
out
of
the
place
and
was
of
sufficiently
good
family
and
tolerably
well
connected
yet
he
never
got
on
never
made
any
real
advance
in
life
nobody
could
tell
what
was
the
cause
of
this
for
his
opinions
were
moderate
and
did
not
stand
in
his
way
indeed
within
the
limits
of
moderation
he
had
been
known
to
modify
his
principles
now
inclining
towards
the
high
then
towards
the
low
according
as
circumstances
required
though
never
going
too
far
in
either
direction
such
a
man
ought
to
have
been
successful
according
to
all
rules
but
he
was
not
he
was
generally
in
debt
and
always
needy
his
eldest
son
james
was
in
india
doing
well
and
had
often
sent
a
contribution
towards
the
comfort
of
the
family
and
especially
to
help
reginald
at
college
but
james
had
married
a
year
before
and
accordingly
was
in
a
less
favourable
position
for
sending
help
and
indeed
these
windfalls
had
never
produced
much
effect
upon
the
family
who
heard
of
james
gifts
vaguely
without
profiting
by
them
all
this
à
to
the
elder
children
having
no
softening
medium
of
a
mother
eyes
to
look
at
their
father
through
they
were
more
bold
in
judging
him
than
perhaps
they
ought
to
have
been
and
he
did
not
take
pains
to
fascinate
his
children
or
throw
the
glamour
of
love
into
their
eyes
he
took
it
for
granted
frankly
and
as
a
part
of
nature
that
he
himself
was
the
first
person
to
be
considered
in
all
matters
so
he
was
of
course
so
the
father
the
the
head
of
the
family
ought
to
be
and
when
he
has
a
wife
to
keep
him
upon
that
pedestal
and
to
secure
that
his
worship
shall
be
respected
it
becomes
natural
and
the
first
article
of
the
family
creed
but
somehow
when
a
man
has
to
set
forth
and
uphold
this
principle
himself
it
is
less
successful
and
in
may
case
it
was
not
successful
at
all
he
was
not
severe
or
tyrannical
so
that
they
might
have
rebelled
he
only
held
the
conviction
quite
honestly
and
ingeniously
that
his
affairs
came
first
and
were
always
to
be
attended
to
nothing
could
be
said
against
this
principle
but
it
tells
badly
in
the
management
of
a
family
unless
indeed
as
we
have
said
it
is
managed
through
the
medium
of
the
mother
who
takes
away
all
imputation
of
selfishness
by
throwing
an
awful
importance
and
tender
sanctity
over
all
that
happens
to
be
desirable
or
necessary
for
papa
may
had
no
wife
to
watch
over
the
approaches
of
his
study
and
talk
of
him
with
reverential
importance
to
her
children
this
was
not
his
fault
but
his
misfortune
bitterly
had
he
mourned
and
resented
the
blow
which
took
her
from
him
and
deeply
felt
the
loss
she
was
to
him
this
was
how
he
spoke
of
it
always
the
loss
to
him
and
probably
poor
may
who
had
adored
and
admired
her
husband
to
the
last
day
of
her
life
would
have
been
more
satisfied
with
this
way
of
mourning
for
her
than
any
other
but
naturally
ursula
who
thought
of
the
loss
to
herself
and
the
other
children
found
fault
with
this
limitation
of
the
misfortune
a
man
who
has
thus
to
fight
for
himself
does
not
appear
in
an
amiable
aspect
to
his
family
to
whom
as
to
all
young
creatures
it
seemed
natural
that
should
be
the
first
objects
and
as
they
were
a
great
trouble
and
burden
to
him
perhaps
the
children
did
not
always
bear
their
most
amiable
aspect
to
their
father
both
looked
selfish
to
the
other
and
may
no
doubt
could
have
made
out
quite
as
good
a
case
as
the
children
did
he
thought
all
young
people
were
selfish
taking
everything
they
could
trying
to
extract
even
the
impossible
from
the
empty
purse
and
strained
patience
of
their
elders
and
they
thought
that
he
was
indifferent
to
them
thinking
about
himself
as
it
is
a
capital
sin
in
a
parent
to
do
and
both
of
them
were
right
and
both
wrong
as
indeed
may
be
said
in
every
case
to
which
there
are
two
sides
ursula
has
come
cried
the
two
little
ones
amy
and
robin
could
read
their
father
face
better
than
they
could
read
those
instruments
of
torture
called
printed
books
and
they
saw
that
he
was
in
a
good
humour
and
that
they
were
safe
to
venture
upon
the
playful
liberty
of
seizing
him
one
by
each
hand
and
dragging
him
in
he
was
a
tall
man
and
the
sight
of
him
triumphantly
dragged
in
by
these
imps
the
youngest
of
whom
was
about
up
to
his
knees
was
pretty
and
would
have
gone
to
the
heart
of
any
spectator
he
was
not
himself
unconscious
of
this
and
when
he
was
in
a
good
humour
and
the
children
were
neat
and
tolerably
dressed
he
did
not
object
to
being
seen
by
the
dragged
up
his
own
steps
by
those
two
little
ones
the
only
however
on
this
occasion
were
a
retired
shopkeeper
and
his
wife
who
had
lately
bought
one
of
the
oldest
houses
in
grange
lane
and
who
had
come
out
for
a
walk
as
the
day
was
fine
mark
my
words
tozer
the
lady
was
saying
that
a
good
man
though
he
a
church
parson
them
as
children
hangs
onto
like
that
ai
got
no
harm
in
them
he
a
rum
un
he
is
said
tozer
in
reply
it
was
a
pity
that
the
pretty
spectacle
of
the
clergyman
with
his
little
boy
and
girl
should
have
been
thus
thrown
away
upon
a
couple
of
dissenters
yet
it
was
not
without
its
effect
amy
pulled
one
arm
and
robin
pulled
the
other
they
were
children
like
all
the
mays
and
as
this
peculiarity
is
rare
among
children
it
gave
these
two
a
certain
piquancy
well
well
he
said
take
me
to
ursula
and
after
he
had
kissed
his
daughter
he
sat
down
in
the
faded
with
much
geniality
and
took
one
child
on
each
knee
i
hope
you
have
enjoyed
yourself
ursula
he
said
of
course
we
have
missed
you
janey
has
done
her
best
but
she
is
not
very
clever
at
housekeeping
nor
does
she
understand
many
things
that
people
require
as
you
have
learned
to
do
oh
i
am
so
glad
you
have
missed
me
said
ursula
i
mean
sorry
i
have
enjoyed
myself
very
very
much
the
dorsets
were
so
kind
kinder
than
anybody
ever
was
before
and
papa
they
have
sent
me
a
new
dress
and
me
too
papa
chirruped
little
amy
on
his
knee
you
too
mouse
it
was
very
kind
of
them
and
you
went
to
the
tower
and
did
all
the
lions
ursula
that
is
the
lot
of
country
cousins
and
the
dorsets
would
spare
you
nothing
i
suppose
we
went
to
much
better
things
said
ursula
producing
her
theatres
and
her
ball
as
she
had
done
before
and
oh
papa
i
like
them
so
much
i
wish
we
lived
a
little
nearer
those
poor
little
indian
children
i
fear
they
will
be
too
much
for
cousin
anne
they
look
so
pale
and
so
peevish
not
like
our
children
here
well
they
are
not
pale
at
all
events
said
may
putting
them
down
run
and
play
like
good
children
you
will
have
heard
that
we
have
had
something
happening
to
us
even
in
this
quiet
place
while
you
were
away
oh
i
was
so
astonished
said
ursula
but
reginald
does
seem
to
like
it
that
is
so
odd
i
should
have
thought
he
would
have
been
overjoyed
to
get
something
he
used
to
talk
so
about
having
no
interest
reginald
is
like
a
great
many
other
people
he
does
not
know
his
own
mind
said
may
his
countenance
overcasting
ursula
knew
that
sign
of
coming
storms
well
enough
but
she
was
too
much
interested
to
forbear
what
is
a
sinecure
papa
she
asked
her
brother
last
word
still
dwelling
in
her
mind
a
piece
of
outrageous
folly
he
cried
getting
up
and
striding
about
the
room
all
springing
from
the
foolish
books
boys
read
and
the
nonsense
that
is
put
into
their
minds
mean
it
means
that
your
brother
is
an
ass
that
is
what
it
means
after
all
the
money
that
has
been
spent
upon
him
but
papa
we
have
not
spent
much
have
we
i
thought
it
was
his
scholarship
said
ursula
with
injudicious
honesty
her
father
turned
upon
her
indignantly
i
am
not
aware
that
i
said
we
have
nothing
to
spend
upon
any
one
so
far
as
i
know
i
said
i
the
only
person
in
the
house
who
earns
any
money
or
is
likely
to
do
so
if
reginald
goes
on
in
this
idiotical
way
ursula
grew
red
she
was
may
own
daughter
and
had
a
temper
too
if
i
could
earn
any
money
i
am
sure
i
would
she
cried
and
only
too
glad
i
am
sure
it
is
wanted
badly
enough
but
how
is
a
girl
to
earn
any
money
i
wish
i
knew
how
you
little
fool
no
one
was
thinking
of
you
do
a
little
more
in
the
house
and
nobody
will
ask
you
to
earn
money
yes
this
is
the
shape
things
are
taking
said
may
the
girls
are
mad
to
earn
anyhow
and
the
boys
forsooth
have
a
hundred
scruples
if
women
would
hold
their
tongues
and
attend
to
their
own
business
i
have
no
doubt
we
should
have
less
of
the
other
nonsense
the
fact
is
everything
is
getting
into
an
unnatural
state
but
if
reginald
thinks
i
am
going
to
maintain
him
in
idleness
at
his
age
papa
for
heaven
sake
do
speak
so
loud
he
will
hear
you
said
ursula
letting
her
fears
of
a
domestic
disturbance
overweigh
her
prudence
he
will
hear
me
i
wish
him
to
hear
me
said
may
raising
his
voice
am
i
to
be
kept
from
saying
what
i
like
how
i
like
in
my
own
house
for
fear
that
reginald
should
hear
me
forsooth
ursula
i
am
glad
to
have
you
at
home
but
if
you
take
reginald
part
in
his
folly
and
set
yourself
against
the
head
of
the
family
you
had
better
go
back
again
and
at
once
may
defy
me
but
i
shall
not
be
contradicted
by
a
chit
of
a
girl
i
give
you
my
word
for
that
ursula
was
silent
she
grew
pale
now
after
her
redness
of
hasty
and
unconsidered
oh
for
cousin
anne
to
shield
and
calm
her
what
a
difference
it
made
to
plunge
back
again
thus
into
trouble
and
strife
he
thinks
it
better
to
be
idle
at
his
father
expense
than
to
do
a
little
work
for
a
handsome
salary
said
may
everything
is
right
that
is
extracted
from
his
father
pocket
though
it
is
contrary
to
a
high
code
of
honour
to
accept
a
sinecure
fine
reasoning
that
is
it
not
the
one
wrongs
nobody
while
the
other
wrongs
you
and
me
and
all
the
children
who
want
every
penny
i
have
to
spend
but
reginald
is
much
too
fine
to
think
of
that
he
thinks
it
quite
natural
that
i
should
go
on
toiling
and
stinting
myself
papa
it
may
be
very
wrong
what
he
is
doing
but
if
you
think
he
wants
to
take
anything
from
you
hold
your
tongue
said
her
father
i
believe
in
deeds
not
in
words
he
has
it
in
his
power
to
help
me
and
he
chooses
instead
for
a
miserable
fantastic
notion
of
his
own
to
balk
all
my
care
for
him
of
course
the
hospital
was
offered
to
him
out
of
respect
for
me
no
one
cares
for
he
is
about
as
much
known
in
carlingford
as
little
amy
is
of
course
it
is
to
show
their
respect
to
me
and
here
he
comes
with
his
fantastic
nonsense
about
a
sinecure
who
is
he
that
he
should
make
such
a
fuss
better
men
than
he
is
have
held
them
and
will
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
a
sinecure
what
does
he
call
a
sinecure
that
is
just
what
i
want
to
know
said
ursula
under
her
breath
but
her
father
did
not
fortunately
hear
this
ejaculation
reginald
had
gone
out
and
happily
was
not
within
hearing
and
may
calmed
down
by
degrees
and
told
ursula
various
circumstances
about
the
parish
and
the
people
which
brought
him
down
out
of
his
anger
and
comforted
her
after
that
passage
of
arms
but
the
commotion
left
him
in
an
excitable
state
a
state
in
which
he
was
very
apt
to
say
things
that
were
disagreeable
and
to
provoke
his
children
to
wrath
in
a
way
which
ursula
thought
was
very
much
against
the
scriptural
rule
things
in
the
parish
are
going
on
much
as
usual
he
said
sam
hurst
is
as
kind
as
ever
indeed
said
ursula
with
a
suppressed
snort
of
anger
may
gave
the
kind
of
offensive
laugh
doubly
offensive
to
every
woman
which
men
give
when
their
vanity
is
excited
and
when
there
is
according
to
the
common
expression
a
lady
in
the
case
yes
she
is
very
kind
he
said
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
she
has
had
the
children
to
tea
a
great
many
times
since
you
have
been
away
to
show
my
sense
of
her
kindness
you
must
ask
her
one
of
these
days
a
woman
who
understands
children
is
always
a
valuable
friend
for
a
man
in
my
position
and
also
ursula
for
a
girl
in
yours
she
may
understand
children
but
they
are
not
fond
of
her
said
ursula
with
a
gleam
of
malice
which
restored
her
father
to
good
humour
he
had
no
more
idea
of
marrying
a
second
time
than
of
flying
he
was
tenderly
attached
in
his
way
to
his
wife
memory
and
quite
sufficiently
troubled
by
the
number
of
dwellers
in
his
house
already
but
he
rather
liked
as
a
man
in
his
wane
generally
does
to
think
that
he
could
marry
if
he
pleased
and
to
hold
the
possibility
over
the
heads
of
his
household
as
a
chastisement
of
all
their
sins
against
him
which
he
could
use
at
any
time
all
the
mays
grew
hot
and
angry
at
the
name
of
sam
hurst
and
their
fear
and
anger
delighted
their
father
he
liked
to
speak
of
her
to
provoke
them
and
partly
for
that
partly
for
other
reasons
of
his
own
kept
up
a
decorous
with
his
neighbour
who
lived
next
door
and
thus
excited
the
apprehensions
and
resentment
of
the
girls
every
day
of
their
lives
when
ursula
thought
of
sam
hurst
she
wished
for
the
dorsets
no
more
it
was
above
all
things
she
felt
her
duty
to
be
here
on
the
spot
to
defend
the
family
from
that
woman
machinations
the
idea
put
energy
into
her
she
ceased
to
be
tired
ceased
to
feel
herself
after
her
journey
capable
of
nothing
but
sitting
still
and
hearing
of
all
that
had
been
done
since
she
went
away
in
the
course
of
the
evening
however
ursula
took
advantage
of
a
quiet
moment
to
look
into
the
dictionary
and
make
herself
quite
safe
about
the
meaning
of
the
word
sinecure
it
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
heard
it
as
may
be
supposed
she
had
heard
of
lucky
people
who
held
sinecures
and
she
had
heard
them
denounced
as
evil
things
but
without
entering
closely
into
the
meaning
now
she
had
a
more
direct
interest
in
it
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
she
was
not
at
all
frightened
by
the
idea
or
disposed
to
reject
it
as
reginald
did
ursula
had
not
learnt
much
about
public
virtue
and
to
get
a
good
income
for
doing
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
seemed
to
her
an
ideal
sort
of
way
of
getting
livelihood
she
wished
with
a
sigh
that
there
were
sinecures
which
could
be
held
by
girls
but
no
in
that
as
in
other
things
gentlemen
kept
all
that
was
good
to
themselves
and
ursula
was
disposed
to
treat
reginald
scruples
with
a
very
high
hand
but
she
did
not
choose
that
her
father
should
attack
him
with
all
these
disagreeable
speeches
about
maintaining
him
in
idleness
and
taunts
about
the
money
that
had
been
spent
on
his
education
that
was
not
the
way
to
manage
him
the
girl
felt
but
ursula
resolved
to
take
her
brother
in
hand
herself
to
argue
with
him
how
foolish
it
was
to
point
out
to
him
that
if
he
did
not
take
it
some
one
else
would
and
that
the
country
would
not
gain
anything
while
he
would
lose
to
laugh
at
his
over
delicacy
to
show
him
how
delightful
it
would
be
if
he
was
independent
and
what
a
help
to
all
his
brothers
and
sisters
in
short
it
seemed
quite
simple
to
ursula
and
she
felt
her
path
mapped
out
before
her
and
triumphed
in
every
stage
of
her
argument
inventing
the
very
weakest
replies
for
reginald
to
make
full
of
the
inspiration
of
this
purpose
she
felt
that
it
was
in
every
way
well
that
she
had
come
home
with
reginald
settled
close
by
going
away
no
longer
standing
by
her
in
her
difficulties
and
even
perhaps
who
could
tell
taking
her
to
parties
and
affording
her
the
means
now
and
then
of
asking
two
or
three
people
to
tea
the
whole
horizon
of
her
life
brightened
for
ursula
she
became
reconciled
to
carlingford
all
that
had
to
be
done
was
to
show
reginald
what
his
duty
was
and
how
foolish
he
was
to
hesitate
and
she
could
not
allow
herself
to
suppose
that
it
was
put
before
him
there
could
long
remain
much
difficulty
upon
that
score
chapter
xi
phœbe
preparations
a
few
days
after
ursula
return
home
another
arrival
took
place
in
carlingford
phoebe
beecham
after
considering
the
case
fully
and
listening
with
keen
interest
to
all
the
indications
she
could
pick
up
as
to
the
peculiarities
of
her
grandfather
house
and
the
many
things
in
life
at
carlingford
which
were
unlike
what
she
had
been
used
to
had
fully
made
up
her
mind
to
dare
the
difficulties
of
that
unknown
existence
and
to
devote
herself
in
her
mother
place
to
the
care
of
her
grandmother
and
the
confusion
of
tom
this
was
partly
undertaken
out
of
a
sense
of
duty
partly
out
of
that
desire
for
change
and
the
unknown
which
has
to
content
itself
in
many
cases
with
the
very
mildest
provision
and
partly
because
phoebe
good
sense
perceived
the
necessity
of
the
matter
she
was
by
no
means
sure
what
were
the
special
circumstances
that
made
tom
disagreeable
to
her
mother
but
she
was
deeply
sensible
of
the
importance
of
preventing
tom
from
securing
to
herself
and
her
family
all
that
and
tozer
had
to
leave
phoebe
was
not
mercenary
in
her
own
person
but
she
had
no
idea
of
giving
up
any
rights
and
she
felt
it
of
the
utmost
importance
that
her
brother
who
was
unfortunately
by
no
means
so
clever
as
herself
should
be
fully
provided
against
all
the
contingencies
of
life
she
was
not
concerned
about
herself
in
that
particular
phoebe
felt
it
a
matter
of
course
that
she
should
marry
and
marry
well
of
this
assured
and
tranquil
sort
serves
a
great
many
excellent
purposes
it
made
her
even
generous
in
her
way
she
believed
in
her
star
in
her
own
certain
in
herself
and
therefore
her
mind
was
free
to
think
and
to
work
for
other
people
she
knew
very
well
by
all
her
mother
said
and
by
all
the
hesitations
of
both
her
parents
that
she
would
have
many
disagreeable
things
to
encounter
in
carlingford
but
she
felt
so
sure
that
nothing
could
really
humiliate
or
pull
her
down
from
her
real
eminence
that
the
knowledge
conveyed
no
fears
to
her
mind
when
this
confidence
in
her
own
superiority
to
all
debasing
influences
is
held
by
the
spotless
princess
in
the
poem
it
is
the
most
beautiful
of
human
sentiments
and
why
it
should
not
be
equally
elevated
when
entertained
by
a
pink
and
plump
modern
young
woman
well
up
in
all
nineteenth
century
refinements
and
the
daughter
of
the
minister
of
the
crescent
chapel
it
would
be
hard
to
say
phoebe
held
it
with
the
strongest
faith
their
ways
of
thinking
perhaps
and
their
ways
of
living
are
not
those
which
i
have
been
used
to
she
said
but
how
does
that
affect
me
i
am
myself
whatever
happens
even
if
poor
dear
grandmamma
habits
are
not
refined
which
i
suppose
is
what
you
mean
mamma
that
does
not
make
me
unrefined
a
lady
must
always
be
a
lady
wherever
she
is
una
she
continued
using
strangely
enough
the
same
argument
which
has
occurred
to
her
historian
is
not
less
a
princess
when
she
is
living
among
the
satyrs
of
course
i
am
not
like
una
and
neither
are
they
like
the
wild
people
in
the
wood
beecham
did
not
know
much
about
una
except
that
she
was
somebody
in
a
book
but
she
kissed
her
daughter
and
assured
her
that
she
was
a
real
comfort
and
devoted
herself
to
her
comfort
for
the
few
days
that
remained
doing
everything
that
it
was
possible
to
do
to
show
her
love
and
so
to
speak
gratitude
to
the
good
child
who
was
thus
throwing
herself
into
the
breach
the
beechams
were
in
no
want
of
money
to
buy
what
pleased
them
and
the
mother
made
many
additions
to
wardrobe
which
that
young
lady
herself
thought
quite
unnecessary
not
reflecting
that
other
sentiments
besides
that
of
simple
love
for
herself
were
involved
they
shall
see
that
my
daughter
is
not
just
like
one
of
their
girls
beecham
said
to
her
husband
and
he
shared
the
feeling
though
he
could
not
but
think
within
himself
that
her
aspect
was
of
very
much
more
importance
than
the
appearance
of
phoebe
tozer
child
could
possibly
be
as
daughter
you
are
quite
right
my
dear
he
replied
vulgar
people
of
that
sort
are
but
too
ready
to
look
down
upon
a
pastor
family
they
ought
to
be
made
to
see
the
difference
the
consequence
of
this
was
that
phoebe
was
fitted
out
like
a
young
princess
going
on
her
travels
ursula
may
would
have
been
out
of
her
wits
with
delight
had
half
these
fine
things
come
her
way
but
phoebe
took
them
very
calmly
i
have
never
undervalued
dress
she
said
as
some
girls
do
i
think
it
is
a
very
important
social
influence
and
even
without
that
mamma
so
long
as
it
pleases
you
so
with
this
mixture
of
philosophy
and
affection
all
went
well
we
must
call
on
copperhead
before
you
go
they
would
think
it
strange
after
all
the
interest
they
have
shown
in
us
have
they
shown
an
interest
in
us
said
phoebe
of
course
we
must
call
and
copperhead
is
a
lady
but
as
for
copperhead
mamma
hush
he
is
the
leading
member
and
very
influential
in
the
connection
a
pastor
family
must
not
be
touchy
phoebe
we
must
put
up
with
a
great
many
things
there
ought
to
be
peace
among
brethren
you
know
and
harmony
is
the
first
thing
that
is
essential
in
a
church
i
wonder
if
harmony
would
be
as
essential
supposing
copperhead
to
come
to
grief
mamma
phoebe
slang
from
you
who
have
always
set
your
face
against
it
what
can
one
talk
but
slang
when
one
thinks
of
such
a
person
said
phoebe
gravely
and
thus
saying
she
opened
the
door
for
her
mother
and
they
went
out
in
their
best
gowns
to
pay
their
visit
copperhead
was
very
civil
to
the
pastor
family
it
was
not
in
her
to
be
uncivil
to
any
one
but
in
her
soft
heart
she
despised
them
a
little
and
comported
herself
to
them
with
that
special
good
behaviour
and
dignified
restraint
which
the
best
natured
people
reserve
for
their
inferiors
for
though
she
went
to
chapel
taken
there
by
copperhead
she
was
church
at
heart
the
interest
which
beecham
took
in
everything
and
the
praises
she
bestowed
on
the
ball
did
not
relax
her
coldness
they
were
too
well
off
too
warm
and
silken
to
call
forth
her
sympathies
and
there
was
little
in
common
between
them
to
afford
any
ground
for
meeting
yes
copperhead
was
quite
well
she
was
quite
well
her
son
was
quite
well
she
hoped
beecham
was
well
she
had
heard
that
most
people
were
pleased
with
the
ball
thank
you
oh
miss
beecham
was
going
away
indeed
she
hoped
the
weather
would
be
good
and
then
copperhead
sat
erect
upon
her
sofa
and
did
not
try
to
say
any
more
though
she
had
not
the
heart
of
a
mouse
she
too
could
play
the
great
lady
when
occasion
served
clarence
however
was
much
more
hospitable
than
his
mother
he
liked
phoebe
who
could
talk
almost
as
if
she
was
in
society
as
girls
talk
in
novels
he
knew
of
course
that
she
was
not
in
society
but
she
was
a
girl
whom
a
fellow
could
get
on
with
who
had
plenty
to
say
for
herself
who
was
not
a
lay
figure
like
many
young
ladies
and
then
she
was
pretty
pink
and
golden
a
piece
of
colour
which
was
attractive
to
the
eye
he
soon
found
out
where
she
was
going
and
let
her
know
that
he
himself
intended
a
visit
to
the
neighbourhood
the
dorsets
live
near
he
said
relations
of
my
mother
you
saw
them
at
the
ball
i
dare
say
you
will
meet
them
somewhere
about
this
it
is
to
be
feared
clarence
said
in
something
of
his
mother
spirit
with
a
warm
sense
of
superiority
for
he
knew
that
the
pastor
daughter
was
very
unlikely
to
meet
the
dorsets
phoebe
however
was
equal
to
the
occasion
i
am
not
at
all
likely
to
meet
them
she
said
with
a
gracious
smile
for
one
thing
i
am
not
going
to
enjoy
myself
but
to
nurse
a
sick
person
and
sick
people
do
go
to
parties
besides
you
know
the
foolish
prejudices
of
society
properly
so
called
i
think
them
foolish
because
they
affect
me
said
phoebe
with
engaging
frankness
if
they
did
not
affect
me
probably
i
should
think
them
all
right
what
foolish
prejudices
said
clarence
thinking
she
was
about
to
say
something
about
her
inferior
position
and
already
feeling
flattered
before
she
spoke
about
dissenters
you
know
she
said
of
course
you
must
be
aware
that
we
are
looked
down
upon
in
society
it
does
not
matter
for
when
people
have
any
sense
as
soon
as
they
know
us
they
do
us
justice
but
of
course
you
must
be
aware
that
the
prejudice
exists
clarence
did
know
and
with
some
bitterness
for
copperhead
though
he
did
not
care
much
perhaps
about
religion
cared
for
his
chapel
and
stood
by
it
with
unswerving
strictness
his
son
who
was
an
oxford
man
and
respectful
of
all
the
prejudices
of
society
did
not
like
this
but
what
could
he
do
against
the
obstinate
dissentership
of
his
father
this
as
much
as
anything
else
had
acted
upon
the
crowd
the
night
of
the
ball
and
made
them
all
nobodies
he
hesitated
to
make
any
reply
and
his
face
flushed
with
shame
and
displeasure
phoebe
felt
that
she
had
avenged
upon
clarence
his
mother
haughty
politeness
she
had
brought
home
to
him
a
sense
of
the
social
inferiority
which
was
common
to
them
both
having
done
this
she
was
satisfied
and
proceeded
to
soften
the
blow
it
can
not
fall
upon
you
who
are
in
so
much
better
a
position
as
it
does
upon
us
said
phoebe
we
are
the
very
head
and
front
of
the
offending
a
dissenting
minister
family
society
and
its
charms
are
not
for
us
and
i
hope
we
know
our
place
she
said
with
mock
humility
when
people
have
any
sense
and
come
to
know
us
it
is
different
and
for
the
foolish
ones
i
do
care
but
you
see
from
that
i
am
not
likely
to
meet
your
cousins
am
i
she
added
with
a
laugh
if
you
mean
that
they
are
among
the
foolish
ones
oh
no
i
do
but
you
ca
suppose
they
will
take
the
trouble
to
find
out
why
should
they
people
entirely
out
of
my
range
and
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
so
you
may
be
quite
sure
i
am
right
when
i
say
we
meet
well
said
clarence
piqued
i
am
going
to
easton
and
i
shall
see
you
if
beecham
will
give
me
permission
to
call
she
will
give
you
the
address
along
with
that
but
till
then
said
phoebe
to
tell
the
truth
she
had
no
desire
to
see
clarence
copperhead
in
carlingford
perhaps
he
meant
something
perhaps
he
did
not
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
phoebe
who
certainly
had
not
allowed
her
affections
to
become
engaged
if
he
did
mean
anything
was
it
likely
that
he
could
support
unmoved
the
grandfather
and
grandmother
who
were
or
had
been
in
trade
on
the
other
hand
was
it
not
better
that
he
should
know
the
worst
phoebe
was
no
she
contemplated
the
issue
with
calm
and
composure
however
it
might
turn
out
he
asked
me
if
he
might
call
said
beecham
in
some
excitement
i
do
care
much
to
have
you
seen
my
darling
out
of
your
own
father
house
just
as
you
please
mamma
just
as
it
suits
best
said
phoebe
dismissing
the
subject
she
was
not
anxious
a
good
deal
depended
on
whether
he
meant
anything
or
nothing
but
even
that
did
not
conclude
the
subject
for
she
had
not
made
up
her
own
mind
why
did
you
tell
them
about
the
mays
said
clarence
as
the
two
ladies
went
out
they
live
in
carlingford
and
i
should
think
it
would
be
pleasant
on
both
sides
my
dear
boy
you
forget
the
difference
of
position
said
copperhead
they
are
dissenters
oh
i
like
that
cried
clarence
half
angry
as
himself
sharing
the
disadvantages
of
the
connection
a
needy
beggar
like
may
has
a
great
deal
to
stand
upon
i
like
that
but
it
is
true
all
the
same
said
copperhead
shaking
her
head
and
you
can
see
the
difference
at
once
i
dare
say
miss
beecham
is
a
very
clever
young
woman
but
between
her
and
miss
may
what
a
difference
there
is
any
one
can
see
it
i
am
afraid
then
i
am
stupid
for
i
ca
see
it
mother
they
are
both
pretty
girls
but
for
amusing
you
and
that
sort
of
thing
give
me
phoebe
she
is
worth
twenty
of
the
other
as
sharp
as
a
needle
and
plenty
to
say
for
herself
this
is
the
kind
of
girl
i
like
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
i
hope
that
is
not
the
kind
of
wife
you
will
like
said
copperhead
with
a
sigh
oh
wife
they
have
a
penny
either
the
one
or
the
other
said
clarence
with
delightful
openness
and
we
may
be
sure
that
would
not
suit
the
governor
even
if
it
suited
me
in
the
mean
time
beecham
and
phoebe
were
walking
up
the
broad
pavement
of
portland
place
towards
their
home
it
is
pleasant
to
see
the
mother
and
the
son
together
said
beecham
who
was
determined
to
see
everything
in
the
best
light
that
concerned
the
copperheads
they
are
so
devoted
to
each
other
and
phoebe
dear
i
do
like
to
talk
in
this
way
to
a
sensible
girl
like
you
but
you
must
see
it
with
your
own
eyes
you
have
certainly
made
a
great
impression
upon
clarence
copperhead
when
he
said
he
hoped
to
see
you
in
carlingford
and
asked
might
he
call
it
was
exactly
like
asking
my
permission
to
pay
you
his
addresses
it
is
very
flattering
but
it
is
embarrassing
as
well
i
do
not
feel
particularly
flattered
mamma
and
i
think
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
give
him
the
address
beecham
looked
anxiously
in
her
daughter
face
is
it
from
prudence
phoebe
or
is
it
that
you
do
like
him
that
you
would
have
him
if
he
asked
you
we
must
wait
till
he
does
ask
me
said
phoebe
decisively
till
then
i
ca
possibly
tell
but
i
do
want
him
at
carlingford
i
know
that
grandpapa
and
grandmamma
are
in
trade
yes
dear
said
beecham
in
a
subdued
voice
dissenters
and
in
trade
and
he
is
going
to
stay
with
the
dorsets
fine
county
people
do
give
him
the
address
if
we
meet
by
chance
there
is
no
harm
done
i
am
not
ashamed
of
any
one
belonging
to
me
but
you
can
say
that
you
do
think
his
father
would
like
him
to
be
visiting
me
at
carlingford
which
i
am
sure
would
be
quite
true
indeed
he
might
go
much
farther
without
finding
any
one
so
well
worth
visiting
said
the
mother
indignant
to
which
phoebe
nodded
her
head
in
tranquil
assent
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
she
said
you
can
always
tell
him
so
and
that
will
please
copperhead
if
ever
he
comes
to
hear
of
it
he
thought
at
one
time
that
i
was
too
entertaining
one
knows
what
that
means
i
should
like
him
to
see
how
little
i
cared
but
my
dear
clarence
copperhead
would
be
worth
a
little
attention
he
could
give
a
girl
a
very
nice
position
beecham
faltered
looking
at
her
daughter
between
every
word
i
am
not
saying
anything
against
clarence
copperhead
said
phoebe
with
composure
but
i
should
like
his
dear
papa
to
know
how
little
i
care
and
that
you
have
refused
him
my
address
this
was
all
she
said
on
the
subject
phoebe
was
quite
ready
to
allow
that
clarence
was
everything
that
her
mother
had
said
and
she
had
fully
worked
out
her
own
theory
on
marriage
which
will
probably
be
hereafter
expounded
in
these
pages
so
that
she
was
not
at
all
shocked
by
having
his
advantages
thus
pointed
out
to
her
but
there
was
no
hurry
she
said
to
herself
if
it
was
not
clarence
copperhead
it
would
be
some
one
else
and
why
should
she
at
this
early
stage
of
her
career
attempt
to
precipitate
the
designs
of
providence
she
had
plenty
of
time
before
her
and
was
in
no
hurry
for
any
change
and
a
genuine
touch
of
nature
in
her
heart
made
her
anxious
for
an
opportunity
of
showing
her
independence
to
that
arrogant
and
offensive
leading
member
who
made
the
life
of
the
in
the
crescent
a
burden
to
them
if
she
could
only
so
drive
him
into
a
corner
that
he
should
be
obliged
to
come
to
her
in
his
despair
and
beg
her
to
accept
his
son
hand
to
save
him
from
going
off
in
a
galloping
consumption
that
would
have
been
a
triumph
after
phoebe
heart
to
be
sure
this
was
a
perfectly
vain
and
wildly
romantic
hope
it
was
the
only
bit
of
wild
and
girlish
romance
in
the
bosom
of
a
very
and
sensible
young
woman
she
had
seen
her
parents
put
up
with
the
arrogance
of
the
millionnaire
for
a
long
time
without
rebelling
any
more
than
they
did
but
copperhead
had
gone
further
than
phoebe
could
bear
and
thoroughly
as
she
understood
her
own
position
and
all
its
interests
this
one
vain
fancy
had
found
a
footing
in
her
mind
if
she
could
but
humble
him
and
make
him
sue
to
her
it
was
not
likely
but
for
such
a
triumph
the
sensible
phoebe
would
have
done
much
it
was
the
one
point
on
which
she
was
silly
but
on
that
she
was
as
silly
as
any
cynic
could
desire
and
thus
with
a
huge
trunk
full
of
charming
dresses
a
fit
for
any
bride
the
prettiest
travelling
costume
imaginable
and
everything
about
her
fit
beecham
fondly
thought
for
a
daughter
phoebe
junior
took
her
departure
to
be
the
comfort
of
her
grandmamma
and
to
dazzle
carlingford
her
fond
parents
accompanied
her
to
the
station
and
placed
her
in
a
carriage
and
fee
a
guard
heavily
to
take
care
of
and
watch
over
her
not
but
that
phoebe
might
be
safely
trusted
to
take
care
of
herself
anywhere
they
said
in
which
expression
of
their
pride
in
their
daughter
the
observant
reader
may
see
a
proof
of
their
own
origin
from
the
humbler
classes
they
would
probably
have
prided
themselves
on
her
timidity
and
helplessness
had
they
been
a
little
better
born
chapter
xii
grange
lane
and
tozer
had
retired
from
business
several
years
before
they
had
given
up
the
shop
with
its
long
established
connection
and
all
its
advantages
to
tom
their
son
finding
themselves
to
have
enough
to
live
upon
in
ease
and
indeed
luxury
and
though
tozer
found
the
house
in
grange
lane
shut
in
by
the
garden
walls
to
be
much
duller
than
her
rooms
over
the
shop
in
high
street
where
she
saw
everything
that
was
going
on
yet
the
increase
in
gentility
was
unquestionable
the
house
which
they
were
fortunate
enough
to
secure
in
this
desirable
locality
had
been
once
in
the
occupation
of
lady
weston
and
there
was
accordingly
an
aroma
of
high
life
about
it
although
somebody
less
important
had
lived
in
it
in
the
mean
time
and
it
had
fallen
into
a
state
of
considerable
dilapidation
which
naturally
made
it
cheaper
tozer
had
solidly
repaired
all
that
was
necessary
for
comfort
but
he
had
not
done
anything
in
those
external
points
of
paint
and
decoration
which
tells
so
much
in
the
aspect
of
a
house
lady
weston
taste
had
been
florid
and
the
walls
continued
as
she
had
left
them
painted
and
papered
with
faded
wreaths
which
were
apt
to
look
dissipated
as
they
ought
to
have
been
refreshed
and
renewed
years
before
but
outside
where
the
wreaths
do
not
fade
there
was
a
delightful
garden
charmingly
laid
out
in
which
lady
weston
had
once
held
her
garden
parties
and
where
the
crocuses
and
other
spring
bulbs
which
had
been
put
in
with
a
lavish
hand
during
lady
weston
extravagant
reign
had
already
begun
to
blow
the
violets
were
peeping
out
from
among
their
leaves
on
a
sheltered
bank
and
christmas
roses
overblown
making
a
great
show
with
their
great
white
stars
in
a
corner
tozer
himself
soon
took
a
great
interest
in
this
little
domain
out
of
doors
and
was
for
ever
pottering
about
the
flowers
obeying
with
the
servility
of
ignorance
the
gardener
injunctions
tozer
however
who
was
in
weak
health
and
consequently
permitted
to
be
somewhat
cross
and
contradictory
regretted
the
high
street
talk
of
a
garden
she
said
a
thing
as
never
changes
except
according
to
the
seasons
up
in
the
town
there
was
never
a
day
the
same
something
always
happening
soldiers
marching
through
or
punch
and
judy
or
a
row
at
the
least
it
is
the
cheerfullest
place
in
the
whole
world
i
do
believe
shut
up
here
may
do
for
the
gentry
but
i
likes
the
streets
and
what
going
on
you
may
call
me
vulgar
if
you
please
but
so
i
do
tozer
prudently
said
nothing
to
such
outbursts
except
a
soothing
exhortation
to
wait
till
summer
when
she
would
find
the
benefit
of
the
fresh
air
not
to
speak
of
the
early
vegetables
and
he
himself
found
the
garden
an
unspeakable
resource
at
first
indeed
he
would
stroll
up
to
the
shop
of
a
morning
especially
if
any
new
consignment
of
york
hams
or
cheese
was
coming
in
which
he
loved
to
turn
over
and
test
by
smell
and
touch
but
by
and
by
the
ancient
butterman
made
a
discovery
such
as
we
are
all
apt
to
make
when
we
get
old
and
step
out
of
the
high
road
of
life
he
found
out
that
his
son
did
not
appreciate
his
advice
and
that
tom
cared
still
less
for
his
frequent
appearances
indeed
he
himself
once
saw
her
bounce
out
of
the
shop
as
he
entered
exclaiming
audibly
here
that
fussy
old
man
again
tozer
was
an
old
man
it
is
true
but
nobody
under
eighty
cares
to
have
the
epithet
flung
in
his
teeth
and
to
be
in
the
way
is
always
unpleasant
he
had
enough
to
say
nothing
about
it
except
in
a
very
modified
shape
to
his
wife
who
was
ready
enough
to
believe
anything
unpleasant
about
tom
but
he
took
to
gardening
with
ardour
from
that
day
and
learned
all
about
the
succession
of
the
flowers
and
how
long
one
set
lasted
and
which
kind
should
be
put
into
the
ground
next
he
would
even
take
off
his
coat
and
do
a
tolerable
day
work
under
the
gardener
direction
to
the
great
advantage
of
his
health
and
temper
while
tozer
grumbled
upstairs
she
was
getting
more
and
more
helpless
about
the
house
unable
to
see
after
the
stout
who
in
her
turn
grumbled
much
at
the
large
house
for
which
one
maid
was
not
enough
many
altercations
took
place
in
consequence
between
the
mistress
and
servant
the
ungrateful
hussy
has
even
as
many
rooms
to
do
as
she
had
in
the
high
street
when
there
was
the
beds
to
make
tozer
said
indignantly
to
her
husband
but
jane
on
her
side
pointed
to
the
length
of
passage
the
stairs
the
dining
and
where
there
had
once
only
been
a
parlour
cook
and
little
enough
said
jane
there
did
ought
to
be
a
man
in
this
kind
of
but
as
there
only
two
in
family
should
say
nothing
if
i
had
a
girl
under
me
things
were
gravitating
towards
this
girl
at
the
time
of
arrival
but
nothing
had
as
yet
been
finally
decided
upon
jane
however
had
bestirred
herself
to
get
the
young
lady
room
ready
with
something
like
alacrity
a
young
person
coming
to
the
house
promised
a
little
movement
and
change
which
was
always
something
and
jane
had
no
doubt
that
phoebe
would
be
on
her
side
in
respect
to
the
girl
want
waiting
upon
and
there
always
be
sending
of
errands
jane
said
to
herself
she
knew
by
experience
what
young
is
in
a
house
there
was
something
perhaps
in
all
the
preparations
for
her
departure
which
had
thrown
dust
in
phoebe
beecham
eyes
she
had
been
too
not
to
see
into
her
mother
qualms
and
hesitations
about
her
visit
to
carlingford
and
the
repeated
warnings
of
both
parents
as
to
the
difference
from
what
she
had
been
accustomed
to
and
she
thought
she
had
fully
prepared
herself
for
what
she
was
to
encounter
but
probably
the
elaborate
outfit
provided
by
her
mother
and
the
importance
attached
to
her
journey
had
to
some
degree
obliterated
this
impression
for
it
is
certain
that
when
phoebe
saw
an
old
man
in
a
shabby
coat
with
a
wisp
of
a
large
white
neckcloth
round
his
throat
watching
anxiously
for
the
arrival
of
the
train
as
it
came
up
she
sustained
a
shock
which
she
had
not
anticipated
it
was
about
five
years
since
she
had
seen
her
grandfather
an
interval
due
to
hazard
rather
than
purpose
though
on
the
whole
the
elder
beechams
had
not
been
sorry
to
keep
their
parents
and
their
children
apart
phoebe
however
knew
her
grandfather
perfectly
well
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
though
he
had
not
perceived
her
and
was
wandering
anxiously
up
and
down
in
search
of
her
she
held
back
in
her
corner
for
the
moment
to
overcome
the
shock
yes
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
there
he
was
he
whom
she
was
going
to
visit
under
whose
auspices
she
was
about
to
appear
in
carlingford
he
was
not
even
like
an
old
dissenting
minister
which
had
been
her
childish
notion
of
him
he
looked
neither
more
nor
less
than
what
he
was
an
old
shopkeeper
very
decent
and
respectable
but
a
little
shabby
and
greasy
like
the
men
whose
weekly
bills
she
had
been
accustomed
to
pay
for
her
mother
she
felt
an
instant
conviction
that
he
would
call
her
if
she
went
up
to
him
and
think
her
one
of
the
quality
poor
phoebe
she
sat
back
in
her
corner
and
gave
a
gasp
of
horror
and
dismay
but
having
done
this
she
was
herself
again
she
gave
herself
a
shake
like
one
who
is
about
to
take
a
plunge
rose
lightly
to
her
feet
took
up
her
bag
and
stepped
out
of
the
carriage
just
as
tozer
strolled
anxiously
past
for
the
third
time
grandpapa
she
cried
with
a
smile
tozer
was
almost
as
much
taken
aback
by
this
apparition
as
phoebe
herself
had
been
he
knew
that
his
daughter
had
made
great
strides
in
social
elevation
and
that
her
children
when
he
had
seen
them
last
had
been
quite
like
children
but
to
see
this
young
princess
step
forth
graciously
out
of
a
carriage
and
address
him
as
grandpapa
took
away
his
breath
why
why
why
miss
you
ai
little
phoebe
he
cried
scared
out
of
his
seven
senses
as
he
afterwards
said
yes
indeed
i
am
little
phoebe
she
said
coming
up
and
kissing
him
dutifully
she
was
he
but
yet
it
was
right
and
phoebe
did
it
i
have
only
two
boxes
and
a
bag
she
said
besides
my
if
you
will
get
a
cab
grandpapa
i
will
go
and
see
after
the
luggage
old
tozer
thought
he
could
have
carried
the
bag
himself
and
left
the
boxes
to
follow
but
he
succumbed
humbly
and
obeyed
she
do
seem
a
bit
proud
he
said
to
himself
but
good
lord
what
she
ever
say
to
my
old
woman
he
saw
the
contrast
very
clearly
between
his
wife
and
this
splendid
grandchild
it
did
not
strike
him
so
much
in
his
own
case
how
is
grandmamma
said
phoebe
blandly
better
i
hope
mamma
was
so
sorry
not
to
come
herself
but
you
know
of
course
she
has
a
great
many
things
to
do
people
in
town
are
obliged
to
keep
up
certain
appearances
you
are
a
great
deal
better
off
in
the
country
grandpapa
lord
bless
you
my
dear
do
you
call
carlingford
the
country
said
tozer
that
is
all
you
know
about
it
your
granny
and
i
are
humble
folks
but
the
new
minister
at
salem
is
one
as
keeps
up
appearances
with
the
best
your
mother
was
always
inclined
for
that
i
hope
she
has
not
brought
you
up
too
fine
for
the
likes
of
us
i
hope
not
indeed
said
phoebe
no
fear
of
my
being
too
fine
for
my
duty
grandpapa
do
you
live
down
this
nice
road
how
pretty
it
is
how
delightful
these
gardens
must
be
in
summer
i
beg
your
pardon
for
calling
it
the
country
it
is
so
quiet
and
so
nice
it
seems
the
country
to
me
ah
to
be
sure
brought
up
in
the
london
smoke
said
tozer
i
do
suppose
now
you
see
a
bit
of
green
from
year
end
to
end
very
bad
for
the
that
is
but
i
ca
say
you
look
poorly
on
it
your
colour
fresh
so
was
your
mother
before
you
to
be
sure
she
was
cooped
up
like
you
oh
we
do
get
a
little
fresh
air
sometimes
in
the
parks
for
instance
said
phoebe
she
was
somewhat
piqued
by
the
idea
that
she
was
supposed
to
live
in
london
smoke
ah
the
parks
are
always
something
but
i
suppose
it
takes
you
a
journey
to
get
at
them
said
tozer
shaking
his
head
you
mind
your
grandmother
temper
just
at
first
my
dear
she
old
poor
soul
and
she
ai
well
and
she
sometimes
cross
above
a
bit
but
she
be
that
proud
of
you
she
wo
know
if
she
on
her
or
and
as
for
a
cross
word
now
and
again
i
hope
as
you
wo
mind
i
sha
mind
anything
grandpapa
said
phoebe
sweetly
so
long
as
i
can
be
of
use
and
these
were
indeed
the
dutiful
sentiments
with
which
she
made
her
entry
upon
this
passage
in
her
life
not
minding
anything
but
to
be
of
use
the
first
glimpse
of
old
tozer
indeed
made
it
quite
evident
to
phoebe
that
nothing
but
duty
could
be
within
her
reach
pleasure
friends
society
the
thought
of
all
such
delights
must
be
abandoned
and
as
for
clarence
copperhead
and
the
miss
dorsets
the
notion
of
meeting
or
receiving
them
was
too
absurd
but
duty
remained
and
phoebe
felt
herself
capable
of
the
sacrifice
demanded
from
her
that
confidence
in
herself
which
we
have
already
indicated
as
a
marked
feature
in
her
character
gave
her
the
consoling
certainty
that
she
could
not
suffer
from
association
with
her
humble
relations
whosoever
saw
her
must
do
her
justice
and
that
serene
conviction
preserved
her
from
all
the
throes
of
uneasy
pride
which
afflict
inferior
minds
in
similar
circumstances
she
had
no
wish
to
exhibit
her
grandfather
and
grandmother
in
their
lowliness
nor
to
be
ostentatious
of
her
homely
origin
as
some
people
are
in
the
very
soreness
of
wounded
pride
but
if
hazard
produced
the
butterman
in
the
midst
of
the
finest
of
her
acquaintances
phoebe
would
still
have
been
perfectly
at
her
ease
she
would
be
herself
whatever
happened
in
the
mean
time
however
it
was
apparent
that
duty
was
what
she
had
to
look
to
duty
and
that
alone
she
had
come
here
not
to
amuse
herself
not
to
please
herself
but
to
do
her
duty
and
having
thus
concluded
upon
her
object
she
felt
comparatively
happy
and
at
her
ease
tozer
had
put
on
her
best
cap
which
was
a
very
gorgeous
creation
she
had
dressed
herself
as
if
for
a
party
with
a
large
brooch
enclosing
a
curl
of
various
coloured
hair
cut
from
the
heads
of
her
children
in
early
life
which
fastened
a
large
worked
collar
over
a
dress
of
silk
and
she
rustled
and
shook
a
good
deal
as
she
came
downstairs
into
the
garden
to
meet
her
grandchild
with
some
excitement
and
sense
of
the
difference
which
could
not
but
be
felt
on
one
side
as
well
as
on
the
other
she
too
was
somewhat
frightened
by
the
appearance
of
the
young
lady
who
was
her
phoebe
child
yet
was
so
unlike
any
other
scion
of
the
tozer
race
and
felt
greatly
disposed
to
curtsey
and
say
to
her
you
grown
a
deal
and
changed
a
deal
since
i
saw
you
last
she
said
restraining
this
impression
and
receiving
phoebe
kiss
with
gratified
yet
feeling
and
then
her
respectful
alarm
getting
too
much
for
her
she
added
faltering
you
find
us
but
humble
folks
perhaps
not
altogether
what
you
been
used
to
phoebe
did
not
think
it
expedient
to
make
any
reply
to
this
outburst
of
humility
grandmamma
i
am
afraid
you
have
yourself
coming
downstairs
to
meet
me
she
said
taking
the
old
lady
hand
and
drawing
it
within
her
arm
yes
i
have
grown
i
am
tall
enough
to
be
of
some
use
but
you
must
not
treat
me
as
if
i
were
a
stranger
no
no
never
mind
my
room
i
am
not
tired
the
journey
is
nothing
let
me
take
you
back
to
your
chair
and
make
you
comfortable
i
feel
myself
quite
at
home
already
the
only
odd
thing
is
that
i
have
never
been
here
before
ah
my
dear
your
mother
thought
too
much
of
you
to
send
you
to
the
likes
of
us
that
the
secret
of
it
she
was
always
fond
of
fine
folks
was
my
phoebe
and
i
do
blame
her
bringing
you
up
quite
the
lady
as
she
done
you
must
not
find
fault
with
mamma
said
phoebe
smiling
what
a
nice
cozy
room
this
is
the
i
suppose
and
here
is
your
cushion
and
your
footstool
at
this
nice
window
how
pleasant
it
is
with
the
crocuses
in
all
the
borders
already
i
am
not
at
all
tired
but
i
am
sure
it
must
be
and
i
should
so
like
a
cup
of
tea
we
thought
said
tozer
as
perhaps
you
might
be
used
to
tea
at
this
time
of
day
oh
it
is
the
right
time
it
is
the
fashionable
hour
said
phoebe
everybody
has
tea
at
five
i
will
run
upstairs
first
and
take
off
my
hat
and
make
myself
tidy
jane
is
that
her
name
do
trouble
grandmamma
jane
will
show
me
the
way
well
said
tozer
to
tozer
as
phoebe
disappeared
the
two
old
people
looked
at
each
other
with
a
little
awe
but
she
as
was
her
nature
took
the
most
depressing
view
she
shook
her
head
she
is
a
deal
too
fine
for
us
tozer
she
said
she
never
make
herself
in
our
quiet
way
phoebe
been
and
brought
her
up
quite
the
lady
it
ai
as
her
dress
is
much
matter
i
have
given
her
a
silk
myself
and
never
thought
of
it
twice
and
something
lively
like
for
a
young
person
of
that
gray
stuff
as
her
mother
might
wear
but
all
the
same
she
ai
one
of
our
sort
she
never
make
herself
with
you
and
me
well
said
tozer
who
was
more
cheerful
she
ai
proud
not
a
bit
and
as
for
manners
you
do
pay
no
more
for
manners
she
came
up
and
give
me
a
kiss
in
the
station
as
affectionate
as
possible
all
i
can
say
for
her
is
as
she
ai
proud
tozer
shook
her
head
but
even
while
she
did
so
pleasanter
dreams
stole
into
her
soul
i
hope
i
be
well
enough
to
get
to
chapel
on
sunday
she
said
just
to
see
the
folk
looks
the
minister
need
expect
much
attention
to
his
sermon
phoebe
tozer
daughter
they
all
be
saying
and
and
it
ai
often
as
anything
like
her
is
seen
in
chapel
that
a
fact
said
the
old
lady
warming
into
the
exultation
of
natural
pride
phoebe
it
must
be
allowed
had
a
good
cry
when
she
got
within
the
shelter
of
her
own
room
which
had
been
very
carefully
prepared
for
her
with
everything
that
was
necessary
for
comfort
according
to
her
grandmother
standard
but
where
the
tent
bed
hung
with
red
and
brown
chintz
and
the
moreen
curtains
drooping
over
the
window
and
the
gigantic
flowers
on
the
carpet
made
phoebe
soul
sick
within
her
notwithstanding
all
her
courage
her
heart
sank
she
had
expected
a
difference
but
she
had
not
looked
for
her
grandfather
greasy
coat
and
wisp
of
neckcloth
or
her
grandmother
amazing
cap
or
the
grammatical
peculiarities
in
which
both
indulged
she
had
a
good
hot
fit
of
crying
and
for
the
moment
felt
so
discouraged
and
depressed
that
the
only
impulse
in
her
mind
was
to
run
away
but
her
temperament
did
not
favour
panics
and
giving
in
was
not
in
her
if
somebody
must
do
it
why
should
not
she
do
it
she
said
to
herself
how
many
times
had
she
heard
in
sermons
and
otherwise
that
no
one
ought
to
look
for
the
sweet
without
the
bitter
and
that
duty
should
never
be
avoided
or
refused
because
it
is
unpleasant
now
was
the
time
to
put
her
principles
to
the
test
and
the
tears
relieved
her
and
gave
her
something
of
the
feeling
of
a
martyr
which
is
always
consolatory
and
sweet
so
she
dried
her
eyes
and
bathed
her
face
and
went
downstairs
cheerful
and
smiling
resolved
that
at
all
costs
her
duty
should
be
done
however
disagreeable
it
might
be
what
a
good
thing
the
new
fashion
of
five
tea
is
for
people
who
have
connections
in
an
inferior
path
of
life
who
make
tea
a
meal
and
do
dine
or
dine
in
the
middle
of
the
day
this
was
the
thought
that
passed
through
phoebe
mind
as
she
went
into
the
and
found
the
table
covered
not
to
say
groaning
under
good
things
she
took
her
place
at
it
and
poured
out
tea
for
the
old
people
and
cut
with
the
most
gracious
philosophy
duchesses
did
the
same
every
day
the
had
renewed
its
ancient
sway
even
in
fashionable
life
it
can
not
be
told
what
a
help
and
refreshment
this
thought
was
to
phoebe
courageous
heart
chapter
xiii
the
tozer
family
when
phoebe
woke
next
morning
under
the
huge
flowers
of
the
old
fashioned
cotton
drapery
of
her
tent
bed
to
see
the
faint
daylight
struggling
in
through
the
heavy
curtains
which
would
not
draw
back
from
the
window
the
discouragement
of
her
first
arrival
for
a
moment
overpowered
her
again
and
with
even
more
reason
for
she
had
more
fully
ascertained
the
resources
of
the
place
in
which
she
found
herself
there
were
no
books
except
some
old
volumes
of
sermons
and
a
few
back
numbers
of
the
congregational
magazine
no
visitors
so
far
as
she
could
make
out
no
newspaper
but
the
carlingford
weekly
gazette
nothing
but
her
grandmother
gossip
about
the
chapel
and
tom
to
pass
the
weary
hours
away
even
last
night
tozer
had
asked
her
whether
she
had
not
any
work
to
beguile
the
long
evening
which
phoebe
occupied
much
more
virtuously
from
her
own
point
of
view
in
endeavouring
to
amuse
the
old
people
by
talking
to
them
though
it
was
morning
and
she
ought
to
have
been
refreshed
and
encouraged
by
the
repose
of
the
night
it
was
again
with
a
few
hot
tears
that
phoebe
contemplated
her
prospects
but
this
was
only
a
passing
weakness
when
she
went
down
to
breakfast
she
was
again
cheerful
as
the
crocuses
that
raised
their
heads
along
the
borders
with
the
promise
of
summer
in
them
the
sun
was
shining
the
sky
was
frosty
but
blue
after
all
her
present
sufferings
could
not
endure
for
ever
phoebe
hurried
to
get
dressed
to
get
her
blue
fingers
warned
by
the
fire
it
is
needless
to
say
that
there
was
no
fire
or
thought
of
a
fire
in
the
chilly
room
with
its
red
and
brown
hangings
in
which
tozer
last
night
had
hoped
she
would
be
happy
no
fear
of
that
grandmamma
she
had
answered
cheerfully
this
was
as
much
a
lie
she
felt
as
if
it
had
been
said
with
the
wickedest
intentions
was
it
as
wrong
how
cold
it
was
and
yet
how
stifling
she
could
scarcely
fasten
the
ribbon
at
her
neck
her
fingers
were
so
cold
yes
grandpapa
it
is
brighter
than
in
london
we
do
live
in
the
city
you
know
we
live
in
rather
a
pretty
neighbourhood
looking
out
on
regent
park
but
it
is
seldom
so
bright
as
the
country
sometimes
the
fog
blows
up
our
way
when
the
wind
is
in
the
east
but
it
is
warmer
i
think
said
phoebe
with
a
little
shiver
stooping
over
the
fire
ah
said
tozer
shaking
her
head
it
your
mother
as
has
spoilt
you
i
do
make
no
doubt
with
fires
and
things
that
takes
the
hardiness
out
of
young
folks
a
little
bit
of
cold
is
wholesome
it
stirs
up
the
blood
them
as
is
used
to
fires
is
always
taking
cold
one
good
fire
in
the
that
always
been
my
principle
and
them
as
is
cold
if
they
ca
warm
theirselves
with
movin
about
which
is
far
the
best
let
them
come
and
warm
their
fingers
when
they
please
as
you
may
be
doing
now
perhaps
it
is
a
very
good
principle
grandmamma
said
phoebe
when
one
is
used
to
it
but
the
country
is
colder
than
town
where
there
are
fires
on
every
side
you
must
have
more
warmth
than
in
a
detached
house
like
this
but
it
is
only
my
hands
after
all
shall
i
make
the
tea
you
should
wear
mittens
like
me
i
always
did
in
the
high
street
especial
when
i
was
going
and
coming
to
the
shop
helping
serve
when
the
children
were
young
and
i
had
the
time
for
it
ah
we
done
with
all
that
now
we
more
at
our
ease
but
i
ca
say
as
we
much
happier
a
shop
is
a
cheerful
sort
of
thing
i
dare
say
your
mother
has
told
you
no
said
phoebe
under
her
breath
but
the
reply
was
not
noticed
she
nearly
dropped
the
teapot
out
of
her
hand
when
she
heard
the
word
shop
yes
to
be
sure
that
was
what
being
in
trade
meant
but
she
had
never
quite
realized
it
till
now
phoebe
was
going
through
a
tremendous
piece
of
mental
discipline
in
these
first
days
she
writhed
secretly
and
moaned
to
herself
why
did
not
mamma
tell
me
but
she
sat
quite
still
outside
and
smiled
as
if
it
was
all
quite
ordinary
and
natural
and
she
had
heard
about
the
shop
all
her
life
it
seemed
cruel
and
unkind
to
have
sent
her
here
without
distinct
warning
of
what
she
was
going
to
meet
but
phoebe
was
a
good
girl
and
would
not
blame
her
father
and
mother
no
doubt
they
meant
it
for
the
best
is
uncle
tom
she
said
faltering
somewhat
in
the
shop
now
if
i
able
said
tozer
i
walk
that
far
with
you
this
morning
or
tozer
i
mean
your
grandfather
will
go
it
a
tidy
house
o
business
though
i
say
it
as
should
seeing
it
was
him
and
me
as
made
it
all
though
i
do
hold
with
tom
nonsense
about
the
new
windows
your
uncle
tom
is
as
innocent
as
innocent
but
as
for
her
she
ai
no
favourite
of
mine
and
i
makes
no
bones
about
saying
so
i
do
mind
who
hears
she
ai
so
bad
as
you
make
her
out
said
tozer
she
kind
enough
in
her
way
your
grandmother
is
to
show
you
off
that
it
my
dear
she
ca
abide
tom
wife
and
she
wants
to
show
her
as
far
finer
than
her
girls
i
do
say
no
it
and
i
not
one
as
stands
against
nature
but
do
you
be
prejudiced
by
my
old
woman
there
she
a
prejudiced
one
nothing
in
the
world
will
make
her
give
up
a
notion
when
she
took
it
into
her
head
no
nothing
and
ai
i
always
right
in
the
end
i
should
think
proved
that
times
enough
said
the
old
woman
yes
i
take
a
little
my
dear
since
you
press
me
so
pretty
folks
take
many
a
thing
when
they
pressed
as
they
would
touch
if
there
was
no
one
to
say
take
a
bit
tozer
he
never
thinks
of
that
he
always
had
the
best
appetites
but
as
for
me
if
i
get
a
cup
o
tea
that
all
as
i
cares
for
you
see
as
she
take
my
view
when
she
once
been
to
the
high
street
she
her
mother
daughter
and
phoebe
ca
abide
that
woman
no
more
than
me
have
they
got
many
children
said
phoebe
i
know
there
are
two
girls
but
as
i
have
never
seen
them
are
they
as
old
as
i
am
she
asked
with
a
tremulous
feeling
at
her
heart
if
there
were
girls
in
the
shop
in
the
high
street
with
whom
she
would
have
to
be
on
familiar
terms
as
her
cousins
and
equals
phoebe
did
not
feel
that
she
could
put
up
with
that
the
eldest
polly
is
only
twelve
said
tozer
but
never
you
mind
my
dear
for
you
sha
be
without
company
there
a
deal
of
families
with
daughters
like
yourself
your
grandmother
wo
say
nothing
against
it
and
as
for
me
i
think
there
nought
so
cheery
as
young
folks
you
shall
have
a
fire
in
the
and
as
many
as
you
like
for
the
young
men
i
ca
say
as
there
many
but
girls
is
plenty
and
as
long
as
you
content
with
that
tozer
regarded
him
with
withering
contempt
across
the
table
you
clever
ones
you
men
she
said
families
with
daughters
do
you
think
the
greens
and
the
robbins
is
company
for
i
dare
say
as
you
heard
your
mother
speak
of
maria
pigeon
my
dear
she
married
john
green
the
grocer
and
very
well
to
do
and
respectable
they
may
be
but
nobody
but
the
likes
of
your
grandfather
would
think
of
you
and
them
making
friends
indeed
i
do
care
for
making
friends
said
phoebe
you
must
remember
that
i
came
not
for
society
but
to
wait
upon
you
dear
grandmamma
i
do
want
young
friends
at
home
i
always
go
out
with
my
mother
let
me
take
walks
with
you
when
you
are
able
i
am
glad
uncle
tom
children
are
little
i
do
want
company
my
work
and
the
garden
and
to
sit
with
grandmamma
that
is
all
i
care
for
i
shall
be
as
happy
as
the
day
is
long
said
this
martyr
smiling
benignly
over
the
aches
in
her
heart
her
grandparents
looked
at
her
with
pride
was
not
this
the
ideal
young
woman
the
girl
of
the
who
cared
about
nothing
but
her
duty
that
very
nice
of
you
my
dear
but
you
ai
going
to
hide
yourself
up
in
a
corner
said
tozer
and
never
fear
i
take
her
wherever
it
fit
for
her
to
go
to
his
wife
added
looking
at
her
with
pride
phoebe
felt
in
addition
to
all
the
rest
that
she
was
to
be
made
a
show
of
to
all
the
connection
as
a
specimen
of
what
the
tozer
blood
could
come
to
and
she
did
not
even
feel
sure
that
something
of
the
same
feeling
had
not
been
in
her
mother
bosom
when
she
fitted
her
out
so
perfectly
phoebe
tozer
had
left
contemporaries
and
rivals
in
carlingford
and
the
thought
of
dazzling
and
surpassing
them
in
her
offspring
as
in
her
good
fortune
had
still
some
sweetness
for
her
mind
mamma
meant
it
too
phoebe
junior
said
to
herself
with
a
sigh
unfortunately
for
her
she
did
everybody
credit
who
belonged
to
her
and
she
must
resign
herself
to
pay
the
penalty
perhaps
there
was
some
compensation
in
that
thought
and
indeed
phoebe
did
not
wonder
at
her
grandmother
pride
when
she
walked
up
with
her
to
high
street
supporting
her
on
her
arm
she
recognised
frankly
that
there
were
not
many
people
like
herself
about
few
who
had
so
much
the
air
of
good
society
and
not
one
who
was
so
well
dressed
there
were
excuses
to
be
made
then
for
the
anxiety
of
the
old
people
to
produce
her
in
the
little
world
which
was
everything
to
them
and
with
her
usual
candour
and
good
sense
she
acknowledged
this
though
she
winced
a
little
when
an
occasional
acquaintance
drifted
across
tozer
path
and
was
introduced
with
pride
to
my
granddaughter
and
thrust
forth
an
ungloved
hand
with
an
exclamation
of
lord
bless
us
phoebe
eldest
i
hope
i
see
you
well
miss
phoebe
continued
urbane
though
it
cost
her
many
a
pang
she
had
to
keep
on
a
perpetual
argument
with
herself
as
she
went
along
slowly
holding
up
her
poor
tottering
steps
if
this
is
what
we
have
really
sprung
from
this
is
my
own
class
and
i
ought
to
like
it
if
i
do
like
it
it
must
be
my
fault
i
have
no
right
to
feel
myself
better
than
they
are
it
is
not
position
that
makes
any
difference
but
individual
character
phoebe
said
to
herself
she
got
as
much
consolation
out
of
this
as
is
to
be
extracted
from
such
rueful
arguments
in
general
but
it
was
after
all
indifferent
comfort
and
had
not
her
temperament
given
her
a
strong
hold
of
herself
and
power
of
subduing
her
impulses
it
is
much
to
be
feared
that
phoebe
would
have
dropped
her
grandmother
arm
as
they
approached
the
station
and
run
away
she
did
waver
for
a
moment
as
she
came
in
sight
of
it
on
that
side
lay
freedom
comfort
the
life
she
had
been
used
to
which
was
not
very
elevated
indeed
but
felt
like
high
rank
in
comparison
with
this
and
she
knew
her
parents
would
forgive
her
and
defend
her
if
she
went
back
to
them
unable
to
support
the
martyrdom
which
she
had
rashly
taken
upon
herself
but
then
how
weak
that
would
be
phoebe
thought
to
herself
drawing
tozer
arm
more
tightly
within
her
own
how
small
how
it
would
hurt
the
feelings
of
the
old
people
how
it
would
vex
and
embarrass
her
father
and
mother
lastly
it
might
peril
her
brother
interests
and
her
own
which
to
do
her
justice
was
the
last
thing
she
thought
of
and
yet
was
not
undeserving
of
notice
in
its
way
lean
on
me
more
heavily
grandmamma
she
said
at
last
finally
concluding
and
throwing
off
this
she
could
not
prolong
it
further
it
was
unworthy
of
her
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
set
her
face
like
a
flint
and
no
longer
leave
the
question
of
her
persistence
in
her
domestic
mission
an
open
question
whatever
she
might
have
to
put
up
with
it
was
now
decided
once
for
all
bless
us
all
if
this
ai
grandmamma
said
tom
it
was
not
often
as
she
herself
said
with
pride
that
she
required
to
be
in
the
shop
which
was
very
much
improved
now
from
its
old
aspect
ill
luck
however
brought
her
here
she
stood
at
the
door
which
led
from
the
shop
to
the
house
dividing
the
counter
talking
to
a
lady
who
was
making
a
complaint
upon
the
quality
of
cheese
or
butter
tozer
had
led
phoebe
that
way
in
order
to
point
out
to
her
the
windows
and
marble
slabs
for
the
cheese
of
which
though
they
were
one
of
her
grievances
against
tom
she
was
secretly
proud
i
do
deny
but
what
they
done
a
deal
said
the
old
woman
show
and
vanity
as
i
call
it
i
wish
they
may
do
as
well
for
themselves
with
all
their
as
me
and
tozer
did
without
it
but
it
ai
often
as
you
see
a
handsomer
shop
she
added
contemplating
fondly
the
scene
of
her
early
labours
if
a
squire
looks
fondly
at
his
land
and
a
sailor
at
his
ship
when
ships
were
worth
looking
at
why
should
not
a
shopkeeper
regard
his
shop
with
the
same
affectionate
feelings
tom
tozer
had
just
taken
leave
of
her
remonstrant
customer
with
a
curtsey
and
an
assurance
that
the
faults
complained
of
should
be
remedied
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
infirm
old
woman
leaning
on
phoebe
arm
and
made
the
exclamation
already
quoted
lord
bless
us
all
if
it
ai
grandmamma
and
phoebe
daughter
along
o
her
i
lay
you
sixpence
said
tom
in
the
extremity
of
her
surprise
and
at
the
highest
pitch
of
her
voice
the
lady
customer
was
still
in
the
shop
and
when
she
heard
this
she
turned
round
and
gave
the
a
stare
it
was
not
very
wonderful
phoebe
allowed
to
herself
with
secret
anguish
she
gave
old
tozer
a
familiar
nod
this
is
quite
a
long
walk
for
you
she
said
gazing
at
phoebe
though
she
addressed
the
old
woman
thank
ye
i
am
a
deal
better
said
tozer
especially
as
i
got
my
granddaughter
to
take
care
of
me
oh
is
this
young
person
your
granddaughter
said
the
customer
with
another
stare
and
then
she
nodded
again
and
went
away
wondering
well
phoebe
said
to
herself
one
little
sting
more
or
less
what
did
it
matter
and
she
went
on
through
the
shop
supporting
her
grandmother
keenly
sensible
of
the
looks
that
encountered
her
on
every
side
tom
stood
leaning
against
the
counter
waiting
for
them
without
making
any
advance
she
was
smart
and
with
a
malicious
gleam
in
a
pair
of
bright
black
beady
eyes
how
are
you
granny
she
said
i
declare
you
looking
quite
young
again
and
as
spry
as
twenty
come
in
and
rest
and
this
young
lady
as
is
with
you
i
do
think
as
i
need
ask
her
name
the
likeness
speaks
for
itself
it
phoebe
beecham
ai
it
bless
us
all
i
have
known
her
anywhere
i
would
the
very
moral
of
her
mother
and
of
you
too
granny
as
you
stand
there
now
you
as
like
as
two
peas
unconsciously
phoebe
cast
a
look
upon
her
grandmother
she
did
not
think
she
was
vain
to
be
unconscious
that
she
had
some
personal
advantages
would
of
course
be
impossible
but
a
thrill
crept
through
her
when
she
looked
at
the
old
woman
by
her
side
wrinkled
and
red
in
her
gown
as
like
as
two
peas
was
that
possible
heart
sank
for
the
moment
to
her
shoes
and
a
pitiful
look
of
restrained
pain
came
to
her
face
this
was
assailing
her
in
her
tenderest
point
am
i
so
like
you
grandmamma
she
said
faltering
but
added
quickly
then
i
can
not
be
like
mamma
how
do
you
do
my
mother
wished
me
to
come
at
once
to
bring
her
kind
regards
is
my
uncle
at
home
no
miss
your
uncle
ai
at
home
said
tom
but
you
might
be
civil
all
the
same
and
put
a
name
to
me
more
nor
if
i
was
a
dog
your
aunt
i
am
and
i
likes
all
my
titles
i
do
and
proper
respect
surely
said
phoebe
with
a
bow
and
a
gracious
smile
but
she
did
not
add
that
name
she
was
pleased
to
think
that
tom
wife
was
her
mother
favourite
aversion
and
that
a
dignified
resistance
to
her
claims
was
so
to
speak
her
duty
it
even
amused
her
to
think
of
the
ingenuity
required
throughout
a
long
conversation
for
the
clever
and
polite
eluding
of
this
claim
i
hope
as
you
mean
to
let
us
in
amelia
said
tozer
for
it
ai
often
as
i
takes
so
long
a
walk
i
would
never
have
thought
of
it
but
for
phoebe
phoebe
junior
as
tozer
calls
her
she
been
used
to
things
very
different
but
i
thankful
to
say
she
ai
a
bit
proud
she
could
be
more
attentive
to
me
if
i
was
the
queen
and
talks
of
your
children
as
pretty
as
possible
without
no
nonsense
it
ai
often
as
you
see
that
in
a
girl
brought
up
like
she
been
i
do
pretend
to
know
nothing
of
how
she
been
brought
up
said
tom
and
i
do
think
as
there
no
occasion
for
pride
here
we
all
and
getting
on
in
the
world
thanks
to
him
as
gives
the
increase
i
do
see
no
opening
for
pride
here
me
and
your
mother
were
never
very
good
friends
phoebe
since
that
your
name
but
if
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
or
my
family
you
wo
ask
twice
grandmother
ai
a
very
lively
house
not
like
mine
as
is
full
of
children
come
in
granny
i
always
speaking
of
making
the
stairs
wider
and
a
big
window
on
the
landing
but
folks
ca
do
everything
at
once
and
we
have
to
do
with
it
a
bit
longer
we
done
a
deal
already
to
the
old
place
more
than
was
wanted
or
was
thought
upon
in
my
time
said
the
old
lady
to
whom
this
was
as
the
trumpet
of
battle
the
stairs
did
well
enough
for
me
and
i
ca
think
what
tom
can
want
changing
things
as
he
been
used
to
all
his
life
oh
it
ai
tom
said
his
wife
her
face
lighting
up
with
satisfaction
tom
would
mind
if
the
place
was
to
come
to
bits
about
our
ears
he
like
you
granny
he
one
of
the
ones
it
ai
tom
it
me
this
little
passage
of
arms
took
place
as
they
were
going
upstairs
which
cost
poor
tozer
many
pantings
and
groaning
and
placed
phoebe
for
once
on
tom
side
for
a
window
on
the
landing
would
have
been
a
wonderful
improvement
there
was
no
denying
when
at
last
they
had
toiled
to
the
top
fighting
their
way
not
only
through
the
obscurity
but
through
an
atmosphere
of
ham
and
cheese
which
almost
choked
phoebe
the
old
lady
was
speechless
with
the
exertion
though
the
air
was
to
her
as
the
air
of
paradise
phoebe
placed
her
on
a
chair
and
undid
her
and
for
a
minute
was
really
alarmed
tom
however
took
it
with
perfect
equanimity
she
blown
a
bit
she
ai
as
young
as
she
was
nor
even
as
she
thinks
for
said
that
sympathetic
person
come
granny
cheer
up
them
stairs
ai
strange
to
you
what
the
good
of
making
a
fuss
sit
down
and
get
your
breath
she
went
on
pulling
forward
a
chair
then
turning
to
phoebe
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
raised
her
eyebrows
breaking
fast
that
what
it
is
said
tom
under
her
breath
with
a
nod
of
her
head
this
is
the
room
as
your
mother
spent
most
of
her
life
in
when
she
was
like
you
said
tozer
when
she
regained
her
breath
it
was
here
as
she
met
your
father
first
the
first
time
i
set
my
eyes
on
him
the
man
for
my
phoebe
i
said
to
myself
and
sure
enough
so
it
turned
out
you
did
miss
no
way
of
helping
it
on
neither
granny
if
folks
do
you
justice
said
tom
mothers
can
do
a
deal
when
they
exerts
themselves
and
now
phoebe
has
a
daughter
of
her
own
i
dare
be
sworn
she
just
as
clever
throwing
the
nice
ones
and
the
ones
in
her
way
it
a
wonder
to
me
as
she
has
gone
off
yet
with
all
her
opportunities
two
or
three
and
twenty
ai
you
miss
phoebe
i
should
have
thought
you
have
married
long
afore
now
i
stall
be
twenty

next
birthday
said
phoebe
my
cousins

a
great
deal
younger

school

hope
i
shall
see
them

said
their
mother
they
their
music
lesson
i
do
hold
with
sending
girls
to
school
i
likes
to
keep
them
under
my
own
eye
i
suppose
i
need
ask
you
now
if
you
play
a
very
little
said
phoebe
who
rather
piqued
herself
upon
her
music
and
who
was
learned
in
bach
and
beethoven
and
had
an
opinion
of
her
own
about
wagner
tom
brightened
visibly
for
her
girls
played
not
a
little
but
a
great
deal
and
draw
but
i
need
ask
for
living
in
london
you
got
masters
at
your
very
door
not
at
all
i
am
sorry
to
say
said
phoebe
with
a
pathetic
tone
of
regret
in
her
voice
lord
bless
us
now
who
have
thought
it
i
think
nothing
a
sacrifice
to
give
mine
the
best
of
education
said
tom
chapter
xiv
strangers
well
ursula
how
do
you
do
said
sam
hurst
meeting
her
young
neighbour
with
outstretched
hands
she
was
a
portly
woman
with
an
active
mind
and
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
to
do
and
instead
of
being
affronted
as
some
persons
might
have
been
she
was
amused
and
indeed
flattered
by
the
suspicion
and
alarm
with
which
all
the
young
mays
regarded
her
whether
she
had
the
least
intention
of
ever
giving
any
justification
to
their
alarms
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
for
indeed
to
a
sensible
woman
of
well
to
do
and
comfortable
a
husband
with
a
temper
of
his
own
and
a
large
poor
unruly
family
was
perhaps
not
so
tempting
as
he
appeared
to
be
to
his
jealous
children
anyhow
she
was
not
at
all
angry
with
them
for
being
jealous
and
afraid
of
her
she
was
cordial
in
her
manner
to
the
mays
as
to
everybody
she
knew
she
asked
how
ursula
had
enjoyed
herself
where
she
had
been
what
she
had
seen
and
a
hundred
questions
more
it
is
quite
delightful
to
see
somebody
who
has
something
to
tell
she
said
when
the
interrogation
was
over
i
ask
everybody
what
news
and
no
one
has
any
news
which
is
dreadful
for
me
how
can
you
care
for
news
said
ursula
news
what
interest
can
there
be
in
mere
news
that
does
concern
us
you
are
very
foolish
my
dear
said
hurst
what
to
become
of
you
when
you
old
if
you
do
like
to
hear
what
going
on
thankful
to
say
i
take
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
my
for
my
part
now
listen
i
tell
you
a
piece
of
news
in
return
for
all
your
information
about
london
when
i
was
in
tozer
shop
i
always
go
there
though
they
are
dissenters
after
all
you
know
most
tradespeople
are
dissenters
some
are
sorry
for
it
some
think
it
quite
natural
that
and
tradespeople
should
think
differently
in
religious
matters
however
what
i
say
is
you
ca
tell
the
difference
in
butter
and
bacon
between
church
and
dissent
can
you
now
and
is
the
best
shop
in
the
town
certainly
the
best
shop
so
as
i
was
in
tozer
as
i
tell
you
who
should
come
in
but
old
tozer
who
once
kept
it
herself
and
by
her
side
figure
my
astonishment
a
young
lady
yes
my
dear
actually
a
young
lady
in
appearance
of
course
i
mean
in
appearance
for
as
you
shall
hear
it
could
be
no
more
than
that
so
nicely
dressed
nothing
vulgar
or
showy
a
gown
that
elise
might
have
made
and
everything
to
correspond
in
perfect
taste
fancy
and
you
may
imagine
how
i
stared
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
off
her
i
was
so
astonished
that
i
rubbed
up
my
old
acquaintance
with
the
old
woman
and
asked
her
how
her
rheumatism
was
i
it
is
rheumatism
at
all
events
i
called
it
so
and
then
she
told
me
as
proud
as
a
peacock
that
it
was
her
granddaughter
fancy
her
granddaughter
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
thing
the
other
woman
in
the
shop
the
present
tozer
called
out
to
her
by
name
phoebe
they
called
her
poor
girl
i
was
so
sorry
for
her
a
lady
in
appearance
and
to
have
to
submit
to
that
ought
ladies
to
be
called
phoebe
asked
janey
why
not
it
rather
a
pretty
name
that
is
so
like
janey
said
hurst
i
know
she
is
the
clever
one
but
she
never
can
see
what
one
means
it
is
not
being
called
phoebe
it
is
because
of
her
relations
that
i
am
sorry
for
her
poor
girl
educating
people
out
of
their
sphere
does
far
more
harm
than
good
i
always
maintain
to
see
that
girl
in
shop
with
all
the
butter
boys
calling
her
phoebe
the
butter
boys
are
as
good
as
any
one
else
cried
janey
whose
tendencies
were
democratic
i
dare
say
she
likes
her
relations
as
well
as
we
like
ours
and
better
though
they
do
keep
a
shop
oh
janey
cried
ursula
whose
feelings
were
touched
then
she
remembered
that
her
sympathies
ought
not
to
flow
in
the
same
channel
with
those
of
sam
hurst
and
continued
coldly
if
she
had
not
liked
them
she
need
not
have
come
to
see
them
that
is
all
you
know
you
girls
you
do
know
the
plague
of
relations
and
how
people
have
got
to
humble
themselves
to
keep
money
in
the
family
or
keep
up
appearances
especially
people
that
have
risen
in
the
world
i
declare
i
think
they
pay
dear
for
rising
in
the
world
or
their
poor
children
pay
dear
you
seem
to
take
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
the
tozers
said
ursula
glad
to
administer
a
little
correction
even
if
they
came
to
roque
i
could
understand
it
but
dissenters
this
arrow
struck
home
well
said
hurst
colouring
of
all
people
to
take
an
interest
in
dissenters
i
am
the
last
but
i
was
struck
i
must
admit
to
see
that
old
tozer
looking
like
an
old
washerwoman
with
a
girl
in
a
dress
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
though
as
plain
as
that
little
brown
frock
of
yours
ursula
that
was
a
sight
to
wake
any
one
up
ursula
looked
down
at
the
little
brown
frock
thus
contemptuously
referred
to
with
mingled
offence
and
consciousness
of
inferiority
it
had
not
cost
as
many
shillings
and
had
been
made
up
at
home
and
was
not
a
shining
example
of
the
dressmaker
art
if
you
value
people
according
to
what
their
dress
costs
i
ca
know
much
about
her
moral
qualities
can
i
said
hurst
and
i
do
suppose
she
has
any
position
being
old
tozer
grandchild
but
she
was
amiss
in
her
looks
and
i
declare
i
should
have
taken
her
for
a
lady
if
i
had
met
her
in
the
street
it
shows
how
one
may
be
taken
in
and
this
is
a
lesson
for
you
young
girls
you
must
never
trust
to
appearances
i
confess
i
like
to
find
out
some
more
about
her
going
in
ursula
well
my
dear
perhaps
i
step
in
for
a
talk
in
the
evening
you
must
be
dull
after
your
gaiety
tell
your
dear
papa
said
hurst
with
a
laugh
that
i
am
coming
to
sit
with
you
after
tea
now
mind
you
give
him
my
message
he
does
not
like
to
miss
me
when
i
come
to
the
parsonage
does
he
now
for
the
present
till
eight
oh
how
i
hate
her
cried
janey
except
sometimes
when
she
makes
me
laugh
and
i
feel
tempted
to
like
her
but
i
always
resist
it
do
you
think
really
ursula
that
papa
could
be
such
a
stupid
oh
please
do
ask
me
cried
ursula
how
can
i
tell
i
do
know
what
he
may
do
but
if
he
does
and
if
she
does
oh
then
janey
yes
indeed
then
said
janey
breathing
hard
this
mysterious
threat
seemed
very
horrible
to
both
of
them
though
what
they
meant
by
it
it
would
have
been
very
hard
for
either
of
them
to
tell
they
waited
within
the
little
shrubbery
whispering
to
each
other
till
they
heard
hurst
close
her
own
door
for
they
did
not
want
any
more
of
her
society
though
they
had
no
intention
of
going
in
when
she
was
safe
out
of
the
way
they
stole
out
and
continued
their
walk
in
the
opposite
direction
i
wanted
to
have
gone
into
the
town
said
ursula
it
hard
to
have
that
woman
next
door
one
ca
go
anywhere
or
do
anything
i
wanted
some
braid
for
your
new
frock
janey
and
twist
to
make
the
but
if
we
had
said
we
were
going
up
into
carlingford
she
would
have
come
too
never
mind
a
walk
is
better
than
nothing
walk
fast
and
let
us
try
how
far
we
can
go
before
tea
upon
this
idea
the
two
girls
set
out
walking
as
if
for
a
race
which
did
them
all
the
good
in
the
world
quickening
the
blood
in
their
veins
sending
the
colour
to
their
cheeks
and
dispersing
all
the
cobwebs
from
their
minds
since
they
soon
got
into
the
spirit
of
the
race
and
pursued
it
with
eagerness
with
little
outbursts
of
laughter
and
breathless
adjurations
to
each
other
to
keep
within
the
proper
pace
and
not
to
run
it
was
not
a
very
inviting
road
along
which
they
took
their
walk
beyond
roque
the
land
was
divided
into
allotments
for
the
working
people
not
very
tidily
kept
and
rough
with
cut
cabbages
plants
and
potatoes
beyond
this
lay
a
great
somewhat
rank
in
smell
and
the
east
wind
swept
chill
along
the
open
road
which
was
not
sheltered
by
a
single
tree
so
that
the
attractions
of
the
way
soon
palled
upon
pedestrians
looking
back
to
grange
lane
the
snug
and
sheltered
look
of
that
genteel
adjunct
to
the
town
was
comforting
to
behold
even
grange
lane
was
not
gay
a
line
of
garden
walls
however
they
may
shelter
and
comfort
the
gardens
within
are
not
lovely
without
but
yet
the
trees
though
leafless
waved
over
the
red
lines
of
brick
and
the
big
laurels
hung
out
bushes
of
dark
verdure
and
long
floating
sprays
of
ivy
let
turn
back
perhaps
she
may
not
be
at
the
window
cried
ursula
it
is
so
dull
here
janey
stopped
short
in
the
heat
of
the
walk
objecting
for
the
moment
i
wish
you
had
not
gone
to
london
you
never
used
to
care
for
the
streets
and
the
shops
now
a
regular
good
walk
is
too
much
for
you
cried
janey
with
a
on
one
side
and
a
on
the
other
said
ursula
in
high
disdain
i
tell
you
what
cried
janey
i
do
think
i
like
you
since
you
came
back
the
dorsets
are
fine
people
and
we
are
not
fine
there
are
no
grand
parties
nor
theatres
nor
balls
at
carlingford
when
we
go
out
here
we
go
to
walk
not
to
see
things
as
you
have
been
used
to
doing
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
it
nineteen
years
with
us
and
one
fortnight
with
them
and
the
fortnight
counts
for
more
than
all
the
years
janey
was
not
in
the
habit
of
restraining
her
voice
any
more
than
anything
else
about
her
and
she
spoke
this
out
with
loud
tones
reckless
who
might
hear
her
in
most
cases
she
might
have
done
this
with
the
utmost
impunity
and
how
was
she
to
know
as
she
said
to
her
sister
afterwards
in
that
any
one
especially
any
gentleman
could
be
lurking
about
spying
upon
people
among
those
nasty
allotments
there
was
some
one
there
however
who
came
down
the
muddy
path
all
cut
up
by
the
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
a
gentleman
janey
called
him
so
without
a
doubt
on
the
subject
but
ursula
more
enlightened
and
slightly
irritated
had
her
doubts
he
was
dressed
not
with
any
care
of
morning
costume
but
wore
a
black
of
the
most
formal
description
with
a
white
cravat
carelessly
tied
and
yet
not
clerical
he
had
a
smile
on
his
face
which
on
the
whole
was
rather
a
handsome
face
and
looked
at
them
showing
evident
signs
of
having
heard
what
janey
said
to
be
sure
he
did
not
say
anything
but
ursula
felt
that
his
look
was
just
the
same
as
if
he
had
spoken
and
coloured
high
resenting
the
intrusion
by
this
stranger
side
was
one
of
the
men
who
had
been
working
at
the
allotments
whose
hands
were
not
clean
and
whose
boots
were
heavy
with
the
clinging
clayey
soil
when
they
had
nearly
reached
the
road
the
gentleman
turned
round
and
shook
hands
with
his
companion
and
then
walked
on
towards
carlingford
throwing
another
look
towards
the
girls
as
he
passed
it
would
be
hard
to
say
whether
curiosity
or
anger
was
strongest
in
ursula
in
janey
the
former
sentiment
carried
everything
before
it
oh
i
wonder
who
he
is
she
cried
low
but
eager
in
her
ear
who
can
he
be
ursula
who
can
he
be
we
know
all
the
men
about
here
every
one
as
well
as
we
know
reginald
oh
ursula
who
do
you
think
he
can
be
he
is
very
impertinent
cried
ursula
with
an
angry
blush
how
should
i
know
and
oh
how
very
silly
of
you
janey
to
talk
so
loud
and
make
impudent
men
stare
at
us
so
impudent
cried
janey
i
did
talk
loud
he
looked
rather
nice
on
the
contrary
why
he
laughed
do
you
call
that
impudent
it
ca
be
anybody
from
the
town
because
we
know
everybody
and
did
you
see
him
shaking
hands
with
that
man
how
very
funny
let
us
run
in
and
tell
sam
hurst
and
ask
her
who
she
thinks
he
is
she
is
sure
to
know
janey
said
ursula
severely
if
you
live
very
long
you
will
be
as
great
a
gossip
and
as
fond
of
news
as
sam
hurst
herself
i
do
care
cried
janey
you
just
as
fond
of
news
as
i
am
only
you
wo
confess
it
i
am
dying
to
know
who
he
is
he
is
quite
and
tall
and
grand
a
new
gentleman
come
quick
ursula
let
us
get
back
and
see
where
he
goes
janey
cried
the
elder
sister
she
was
half
curious
herself
but
ursula
was
old
enough
to
know
better
and
to
be
ashamed
of
the
naïve
and
undisguised
curiosity
oh
what
would
cousin
anne
say
a
girl
running
after
a
gentleman
even
if
he
is
a
gentleman
to
see
where
he
goes
well
cried
janey
if
she
wants
to
know
what
else
is
she
to
do
who
cares
for
cousin
anne
she
is
an
old
maid
why
if
it
had
been
a
lady
i
should
have
minded
there
are
so
many
ladies
but
a
new
gentleman
if
you
wo
come
on
i
will
run
by
myself
how
pleased
sam
hurst
will
be
i
thought
you
hated
sam
hurst
so
i
do
when
i
think
of
papa
but
when
there
anything
going
on
or
anything
to
find
out
i
like
her
dearly
she
such
fun
she
never
like
you
she
not
an
old
maid
like
your
cousin
anne
that
you
are
always
talking
of
come
along
if
anybody
else
finds
out
who
he
is
before
we
do
cried
janey
with
almost
despairing
energy
i
shall
break
my
heart
ursula
stoically
resisted
the
tug
upon
her
but
she
went
back
to
grange
lane
to
which
indeed
she
had
turned
her
face
before
they
met
the
stranger
and
she
could
not
help
seeing
the
tall
black
figure
in
front
of
her
which
janey
watched
so
eagerly
ursula
was
not
eager
but
she
could
not
help
seeing
him
he
walked
up
the
street
quickly
not
as
if
he
thought
himself
of
interest
to
any
one
but
when
he
had
got
half
way
up
grange
lane
crossed
to
speak
to
somebody
this
filled
janey
with
consternation
he
is
not
such
a
stranger
after
all
she
cried
he
knows
some
one
he
will
not
be
quite
a
discovery
who
is
it
he
is
talking
to
i
wonder
he
is
standing
at
one
of
the
doors
but
it
is
not
miss
humphreys
nor
miss
griffiths
nor
any
of
the
charters
perhaps
she
is
a
stranger
too
if
he
is
married
he
wo
be
half
so
interesting
for
there
are
always
plenty
of
ladies
perhaps
he
has
just
come
by
the
railway
to
spend
the
day
but
then
there
is
nothing
to
see
in
carlingford
and
how
did
he
know
that
man
at
the
lots
oh
ursula
why
do
you
answer
me
why
do
you
say
something
have
you
no
feeling
i
am
sure
it
do
matter
a
bit
to
me
for
i
am
not
out
i
am
never
asked
to
parties
but
i
take
an
interest
for
you
other
girls
sake
before
this
time
however
ursula
had
found
a
new
object
of
interest
she
had
not
been
quite
so
unmoved
as
janey
supposed
a
new
gentleman
was
a
thing
to
awaken
anybody
who
knew
carlingford
for
indeed
gentlemen
were
scarce
in
the
society
of
the
little
town
and
even
at
the
most
mild
of
it
is
ludicrous
to
see
one
man
and
that
most
likely
a
curate
among
a
dozen
ladies
so
that
even
when
she
appeared
to
janey
to
wonder
she
felt
that
her
sister
curiosity
was
not
unjustifiable
but
while
thus
engaged
in
the
enterprise
of
discovering
a
new
gentleman
for
the
good
of
society
ursula
eyes
and
her
attention
were
caught
by
another
interest
the
stranger
had
crossed
the
street
to
talk
to
a
lady
who
had
been
walking
down
the
lane
and
whom
ursula
felt
she
had
seen
somewhere
who
was
it
certainly
not
miss
humphreys
nor
miss
griffiths
nor
any
other
of
the
young
ladies
of
grange
lane
the
setting
sun
which
had
come
out
suddenly
after
a
dull
day
threw
a
slanting
ray
up
the
street
which
fell
upon
the
strangers
as
they
stood
talking
this
ray
caught
the
young
lady
hair
and
flashed
back
a
reflection
out
of
the
shining
coils
which
looked
to
ursula
being
dark
herself
she
admired
golden
hair
more
than
anything
as
bright
as
the
sunshine
and
in
the
light
she
caught
the
of
a
pretty
head
and
of
a
nose
slightly
according
to
the
model
which
the
laureate
has
brought
into
fashion
where
had
she
seen
her
before
she
remembered
all
at
once
with
a
rush
of
bewildered
pleasure
janey
oh
janey
she
cried
listen
this
is
too
extraordinary
there
is
the
young
lady
in
black
janey
as
may
be
supposed
had
heard
every
detail
of
ball
and
knew
what
ursula
meant
as
well
as
ursula
herself
did
she
grew
pale
with
excitement
and
curiosity
no
she
said
you
ca
mean
it
are
you
sure
are
you
quite
sure
two
new
people
in
one
day
why
everybody
must
be
coming
to
carlingford
it
makes
me
feel
quite
strange
said
this
susceptible
young
woman
the
young
lady
in
black
oh
yes
there
ca
be
any
mistake
said
ursula
hurrying
on
in
her
excitement
i
looked
at
her
so
much
i
could
mistake
her
oh
i
wonder
if
she
will
know
me
i
wonder
if
she
will
speak
to
me
or
if
she
is
going
to
see
the
dorsets
or
what
has
brought
her
to
carlingford
only
fancy
janey
the
young
lady
in
black
whom
i
have
talked
so
much
of
oh
i
wonder
i
do
wonder
what
has
brought
her
here
they
were
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lane
so
that
their
hurried
approach
did
not
startle
the
strangers
but
phoebe
looking
up
at
the
sound
of
the
footsteps
saw
a
face
she
knew
looking
wistfully
eagerly
at
her
with
evident
recognition
phoebe
had
a
faculty
quite
royal
of
remembering
faces
and
it
took
but
a
moment
to
recall
ursula
to
her
another
moment
was
spent
in
a
rapid
discussion
with
herself
as
to
whether
she
should
give
or
withhold
the
salutation
which
the
girl
evidently
sought
but
what
harm
could
it
do
and
it
would
be
pleasant
to
know
some
one
and
if
on
finding
out
who
she
was
miss
dorset
little
relation
shrank
from
her
acquaintance
why
then
phoebe
said
to
herself
i
shall
be
no
worse
than
before
so
she
sent
a
smile
and
a
bow
across
the
road
and
said
how
do
you
do
in
a
pause
of
her
conversation
ursula
was
too
shy
to
feel
on
equal
terms
with
the
young
lady
in
black
who
was
so
much
more
than
she
was
she
blushed
and
smiled
answered
quite
well
thank
you
across
the
lane
like
a
child
and
notwithstanding
a
great
many
pokes
from
janey
energetic
elbow
went
on
without
further
response
oh
why
ca
you
run
across
and
speak
to
her
cried
janey
oh
how
funny
you
are
and
how
disagreeable
would
pass
any
one
i
knew
like
that
you
do
understand
you
are
only
a
child
said
ursula
frightened
and
agitated
yet
full
of
dignity
we
have
only
met
in
society
when
you
are
introduced
to
any
one
in
society
it
does
not
count
perhaps
they
might
not
want
to
know
you
perhaps
but
anyhow
you
ca
rush
up
to
them
like
two
girls
at
school
you
have
to
wait
and
see
what
they
will
do
well
i
declare
cried
janey
then
what
is
the
good
of
society
you
know
them
and
yet
you
must
know
them
i
would
never
be
such
a
fool
as
that
fancy
looking
at
her
across
the
lane
and
saying
well
thank
you
after
she
had
begun
to
speak
i
suppose
that
cousin
way
i
should
have
rushed
across
and
asked
where
she
was
staying
and
when
she
would
come
to
see
us
ursula
oh
cried
janey
suddenly
changing
her
tone
and
looking
at
her
sister
with
eyes
which
had
widened
to
twice
their
natural
size
with
the
grandeur
of
the
idea
you
will
have
to
ask
her
to
tea
oh
you
silly
girl
do
you
think
she
would
come
you
should
have
seen
her
at
the
ball
she
knew
everybody
and
had
such
quantities
of
partners
clarence
copperhead
was
always
dancing
with
her
fancy
her
coming
to
tea
with
us
but
ursula
herself
was
somewhat
breathless
with
the
suggestion
when
a
thing
has
been
once
said
there
is
always
a
chance
that
it
may
be
done
and
the
two
girls
walked
up
very
quickly
into
the
high
street
after
this
silent
with
a
certain
awe
of
themselves
and
their
possibilities
it
might
be
done
now
that
it
had
been
said
chapter
xv
a
domestic
crisis
the
interest
shown
by
the
two
girls
in
the
stranger
whom
they
had
noted
with
so
much
attention
was
not
destined
to
meet
with
any
immediate
reward
neither
he
nor
the
young
lady
in
black
whom
he
hurried
across
the
street
to
meet
could
be
heard
of
or
was
seen
for
full
two
days
afterwards
to
the
great
disappointment
of
the
young
mays
ursula
especially
who
had
been
entertaining
vague
but
dazzling
thoughts
of
a
companionship
more
interesting
than
janey
more
novel
and
at
the
same
time
more
equal
than
that
which
was
extended
to
her
by
the
miss
griffiths
in
grange
lane
who
were
so
much
better
off
and
had
so
much
less
to
do
than
she
ursula
did
not
recollect
the
name
of
the
fortunate
girl
who
was
so
much
in
the
ascendant
at
copperhead
ball
though
phoebe
had
been
introduced
to
her
but
she
did
recollect
her
popularity
and
general
friendliness
and
the
number
of
partners
she
had
and
all
those
delightful
signs
of
greatness
which
impress
a
poor
little
stranger
to
whom
her
first
dance
is
not
unmingled
pleasure
she
whispered
to
janey
about
her
even
in
the
when
all
the
family
were
assembled
do
you
think
she
will
call
said
ursula
asking
counsel
even
of
janey
inexperience
of
which
she
was
so
contemptuous
on
other
occasions
call
how
can
she
if
she
is
a
stranger
said
janey
as
if
you
knew
anything
about
it
ursula
retorted
with
great
injustice
if
i
do
know
then
why
do
you
ask
me
complained
janey
with
reason
the
room
looked
more
cheerful
since
ursula
had
come
home
the
fire
no
longer
choked
with
cinders
burned
clear
and
red
the
lamp
though
it
was
a
cheap
one
and
burned
paraffin
oil
did
not
smell
the
old
curtains
were
nicely
drawn
and
the
old
covers
smoothed
over
the
chairs
all
this
did
not
make
them
look
less
old
but
it
made
their
antiquity
natural
and
becoming
johnnie
the
was
learning
his
lessons
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
reginald
sat
writing
with
a
candle
all
to
himself
at
a
in
a
corner
ursula
and
janey
were
working
at
the
centre
table
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
they
had
no
time
you
may
imagine
for
janey
with
many
contortions
of
her
person
especially
of
her
mouth
with
which
she
seemed
to
follow
the
movements
of
her
needle
was
stitching
up
a
sleeve
of
her
new
frock
which
miss
dorset
had
sent
her
and
which
a
poor
who
went
out
was
at
this
moment
making
up
in
the
schoolroom
while
ursula
was
still
busy
with
the
basket
of
stockings
which
she
had
found
awaiting
her
on
their
return
what
reginald
was
doing
at
the
was
probably
a
great
deal
less
useful
but
the
girls
respected
his
occupation
as
no
one
ever
thought
of
respecting
theirs
and
carried
on
their
conversation
under
their
breath
not
to
interrupt
him
the
little
children
had
gone
to
bed
tea
was
over
and
several
hours
of
the
long
winter
evening
still
before
them
janey
had
given
over
lessons
partly
because
there
was
no
one
to
insist
upon
her
doing
them
once
in
a
week
or
so
her
father
gave
her
a
lecture
for
her
ignorance
and
ordered
her
into
his
study
to
do
a
long
sum
in
arithmetic
out
of
the
first
old
colenso
that
could
be
picked
up
and
about
once
a
week
too
awakening
suddenly
to
a
sense
of
her
own
deficiencies
she
would
practise
energetically
on
the
old
piano
this
was
all
that
was
being
done
for
janey
in
the
way
of
education
she
was
fifteen
and
as
johnnie
and
amy
and
robin
were
at
an
age
when
school
is
a
necessity
the
only
retrenchment
possible
was
to
keep
janey
at
home
ursula
had
got
what
education
she
possessed
in
the
same
irregular
way
it
was
not
much
besides
reading
and
writing
she
had
pretty
manners
which
came
by
nature
like
those
other
gifts
a
girl
is
not
so
badly
off
who
can
read
and
write
and
has
pretty
manners
janey
possessed
the
two
first
faculties
but
neither
had
nor
apparently
could
acquire
the
third
the
two
dark
brown
heads
were
close
together
as
they
worked
ursula
shining
and
neat
and
carefully
arranged
janey
rough
with
but
they
were
more
interesting
than
reginald
though
he
was
so
much
better
informed
as
for
johnnie
he
lay
extended
on
the
rug
his
head
slightly
raised
on
his
two
hands
his
book
on
a
level
with
the
rest
of
his
person
saying
over
his
lesson
to
himself
with
moving
lips
and
now
and
then
when
the
girls
whispered
chatter
was
silent
the
sound
of
reginald
pen
scratching
across
the
paper
would
fill
up
the
interval
it
was
a
sound
which
filled
them
all
with
respect
this
peaceful
domestic
scene
was
broken
in
upon
by
the
entry
of
may
from
the
moment
that
he
closed
the
behind
him
coming
in
a
little
thrill
ran
through
the
family
party
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
when
they
heard
that
sound
and
johnnie
without
stopping
his
inward
repetition
shifted
himself
and
his
book
adroitly
with
the
cleverness
of
practice
to
the
side
instead
of
the
front
of
the
fire
reginald
pen
stopped
its
scratching
and
he
wheeled
round
on
his
chair
to
give
an
appealing
glance
at
his
sisters
what
is
it
now
he
said
hurriedly
every
one
knew
that
when
the
door
was
closed
like
that
it
meant
something
like
a
declaration
of
war
but
they
had
not
much
time
to
wait
and
wonder
may
came
in
pushing
the
door
wide
open
before
him
and
admitting
a
gust
of
chill
air
of
the
january
night
he
looked
at
the
peaceable
domestic
scene
with
a
humph
of
dissatisfaction
because
there
was
nothing
to
find
fault
with
which
is
as
great
a
grievance
as
another
when
one
is
in
the
mood
for
grievances
he
had
come
in
cross
and
out
of
sorts
with
a
private
cause
for
his
which
he
did
not
choose
to
reveal
and
it
would
have
been
a
relief
to
him
had
he
found
them
all
chattering
or
wasting
their
time
instead
of
being
occupied
in
this
perfectly
dutiful
way
even
johnnie
at
his
lessons
repeating
them
over
under
his
breath
what
was
the
world
coming
to
may
was
disappointed
instead
of
leading
up
to
it
gradually
by
a
general
of
his
children
all
round
he
had
to
open
upon
his
chief
subject
at
once
which
was
not
nearly
so
agreeable
a
way
what
are
you
doing
reginald
he
asked
roughly
pulling
his
chair
to
the
other
side
of
the
fire
opposite
the
corner
to
which
johnnie
had
scuffled
out
of
the
way
i
have
come
in
especially
to
speak
to
you
it
is
time
this
was
done
with
do
you
mean
to
accept
the
college
chaplaincy
or
not
an
answer
must
be
given
and
that
at
once
are
you
so
busy
that
you
ca
attend
to
what
i
say
i
am
not
busy
at
all
sir
said
reginald
in
a
subdued
voice
while
his
sisters
cast
sympathetic
looks
at
him
both
the
girls
it
is
true
thought
him
extremely
foolish
but
what
of
that
necessarily
they
were
on
his
side
against
papa
i
thought
as
much
indeed
it
would
be
hard
to
say
what
you
could
find
to
be
busy
at
but
look
here
this
must
come
to
an
end
one
way
or
another
you
know
my
opinion
on
the
subject
and
you
know
mine
sir
said
reginald
rising
and
coming
forward
to
the
fire
i
do
say
anything
against
the
old
college
for
an
old
man
it
might
be
quite
a
justifiable
arrangement
one
who
had
already
spent
his
strength
in
work
but
for
me
of
course
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
and
two
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
for
the
doing
of
it
not
to
speak
of
the
house
which
you
could
let
for
fifty
more
father
do
you
see
that
is
just
the
very
thing
that
i
object
to
so
much
for
nothing
you
prefer
nothing
for
nothing
said
may
with
a
smile
well
i
suppose
that
is
more
fair
perhaps
to
the
public
but
how
about
me
a
son
of
depending
upon
me
for
everything
useless
and
bringing
in
nothing
does
not
suit
me
you
are
all
the
same
he
said
all
taking
from
me
with
a
thousand
wants
education
clothes
amusement
i
am
sure
said
the
irrepressible
janey
it
is
not
much
clothes
we
get
and
as
for
amusements
and
education
hold
your
tongue
cried
her
father
here
are
six
of
you
one
more
helpless
than
another
and
the
eldest
the
most
helpless
of
all
i
did
not
force
you
into
the
church
you
might
have
gone
out
to
james
if
you
had
liked
but
you
chose
an
academical
career
and
then
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
i
gave
you
a
title
to
orders
you
are
my
curate
just
now
so
called
but
you
know
i
ca
pay
a
curate
and
you
know
i
ca
afford
to
keep
you
providence
said
may
sitting
up
in
his
chair
with
a
certain
solemnity
providence
itself
has
stepped
in
to
make
your
path
clear
here
is
better
than
a
living
a
provision
for
you
i
do
bid
you
take
it
for
life
take
it
for
a
year
or
two
till
you
can
hear
of
something
better
now
what
on
earth
is
your
objection
to
this
the
girls
had
both
turned
their
faces
towards
their
brother
janey
always
the
first
in
action
repeated
almost
unconsciously
yes
what
on
earth
reginald
can
be
your
objection
to
this
reginald
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
looked
helplessly
at
them
against
his
father
alone
he
might
have
made
a
stand
but
when
the
united
family
thus
gazed
at
him
with
inquiring
and
reproachful
looks
what
was
he
to
say
objection
he
faltered
you
know
very
well
what
my
objection
is
it
is
not
honest
work
it
is
no
work
it
is
a
waste
of
money
that
might
be
better
employed
it
is
a
sinecure
and
what
do
you
call
your
nominal
curateship
said
his
father
is
not
that
a
sinecure
too
if
it
is
said
reginald
growing
red
but
feeling
bolder
for
here
the
family
veered
round
and
placed
itself
on
his
side
it
is
of
a
contrary
kind
it
is
pay
my
work
may
be
bad
though
i
hope
not
but
my
pay
is
nothing
i
do
see
any
resemblance
between
the
two
your
pay
nothing
cried
the
father
enraged
what
do
you
call
your
living
your
food
that
you
are
so
fastidious
about
your
floods
of
beer
and
all
the
rest
of
it
not
to
speak
of
tailors
bills
much
heavier
than
mine
which
are
never
paid
whose
fault
is
it
that
they
are
never
paid
yours
and
the
others
who
weigh
me
down
to
the
ground
and
never
try
to
help
or
do
anything
for
themselves
never
paid
how
should
i
have
gone
on
to
this
period
and
secured
universal
respect
if
they
had
never
been
paid
i
have
had
to
pay
for
all
of
you
said
may
bitterly
and
all
your
vagaries
education
till
i
have
been
nearly
ruined
dresses
and
ribbons
and
a
hundred
fooleries
for
these
girls
who
are
of
no
use
who
will
never
give
me
back
a
farthing
papa
cried
ursula
and
janey
in
one
breath
hold
your
tongues
useless
impedimenta
not
even
able
to
scrub
the
floors
and
make
the
beds
which
is
all
you
could
ever
be
good
for
and
you
must
have
a
servant
forsooth
to
do
even
that
but
why
should
i
speak
of
the
girls
he
added
with
a
sarcastic
smile
they
can
do
nothing
better
poor
creatures
but
you
who
call
yourself
a
man
a
university
man
save
the
mark
a
fine
fellow
with
the
oxford
stamp
upon
you
your
next
birthday
it
is
a
fine
thing
that
i
should
still
have
to
support
you
reginald
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
stung
beyond
bearing
not
that
he
had
not
heard
it
all
before
but
to
get
accustomed
to
such
taunts
is
difficult
and
it
is
still
more
difficult
for
a
young
and
susceptible
mind
to
contradict
all
that
is
seemly
and
becoming
in
nature
and
to
put
forth
its
own
statement
in
return
reginald
knew
that
his
education
had
in
reality
cost
his
father
very
little
and
that
his
father
knew
this
he
was
aware
too
much
more
distinctly
than
may
knew
of
james
remittances
on
his
account
but
what
could
he
say
it
was
his
father
who
insulted
him
and
the
young
man
lips
were
closed
but
the
effort
was
a
hard
one
he
could
not
stand
still
there
and
face
the
man
who
had
so
little
consideration
for
his
feelings
all
he
could
do
was
to
keep
his
agitation
and
irritation
down
by
that
hurried
promenade
about
the
room
listening
as
little
as
he
could
and
answering
not
at
all
oh
papa
how
can
you
cried
janey
seizing
the
first
pause
janey
was
not
old
enough
to
understand
the
delicacy
that
closed
reginald
lips
and
the
impulse
of
was
stirring
in
her
how
dare
you
talk
to
ursula
so
i
may
be
much
use
but
ursula
nice
and
comfortable
you
were
when
she
was
away
as
if
you
did
say
so
ten
times
in
a
morning
to
be
sure
that
was
to
make
me
feel
uncomfortable
scrub
floors
cried
janey
in
the
violence
of
her
resentment
i
go
out
and
be
a
whenever
you
please
i
am
sure
it
would
be
much
happier
than
here
hold
your
tongue
said
may
you
scolding
and
ursula
crying
that
the
beauty
of
the
feminine
element
in
a
house
i
ought
to
be
very
thankful
ought
i
that
i
have
girls
to
furnish
this
agreeable
variety
but
as
for
you
reginald
his
father
added
mark
my
words
if
you
determine
to
reject
this
windfall
that
providence
has
blown
into
your
hands
it
must
be
done
at
once
no
further
play
of
i
would
and
i
would
not
if
you
please
here
and
if
it
does
not
suit
you
you
will
please
to
understand
that
i
have
no
further
need
for
a
curate
that
suits
me
still
less
i
want
your
room
if
nothing
else
can
be
done
i
must
try
to
take
a
pupil
to
add
a
little
to
the
income
which
has
so
many
claims
upon
it
and
i
do
mean
to
go
on
keeping
you
this
is
plain
enough
i
hope
very
plain
sir
said
reginald
who
had
grown
as
pale
as
he
was
red
before
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
you
will
write
to
the
corporation
at
once
accepting
or
rejecting
at
your
pleasure
but
this
must
be
done
i
must
insist
on
its
being
done
and
if
you
find
yourself
sufficiently
bold
to
reject
an
income
said
may
with
emphasis
and
go
off
into
the
world
without
a
penny
in
your
pocket
i
wash
my
hands
of
it
it
is
nothing
to
me
then
there
was
a
pause
the
father
of
the
family
sat
down
in
his
chair
and
looked
round
him
with
the
happy
consciousness
that
he
had
made
everybody
miserable
the
girls
were
both
crying
reginald
pale
and
desperate
coming
and
going
through
the
room
no
one
had
escaped
but
johnnie
who
happy
in
insignificance
lay
all
his
length
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
and
lifted
his
face
from
his
book
to
watch
the
discomfiture
of
the
others
johnnie
had
no
terrors
on
his
own
account
he
had
done
nothing
to
call
forth
the
paternal
wrath
may
could
not
resist
this
temptation
is
that
a
way
to
learn
lessons
as
they
ought
to
be
learnt
he
cried
suddenly
throwing
one
of
his
darts
at
the
unthinking
boy
get
up
this
moment
and
sit
down
to
a
table
somewhere
your
own
room
where
there
is
nobody
to
disturb
you
is
better
than
amid
the
here
do
you
hear
me
get
up
sir
and
go
johnnie
stumbled
to
his
feet
appalled
he
was
too
much
startled
to
say
anything
he
took
his
books
across
the
room
to
the
which
reginald
had
abandoned
in
a
similar
way
but
by
the
time
he
reached
that
haven
he
came
to
himself
and
recovering
his
courage
muttered
something
about
the
hardship
to
which
he
was
thus
exposed
as
boys
have
a
way
of
doing
upon
which
may
got
suddenly
up
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
and
turned
him
out
of
the
i
said
your
own
room
sir
cried
this
impartial
father
distributing
to
all
alike
an
equal
share
of
his
urbanities
when
he
had
accomplished
this
he
stood
for
a
moment
and
looked
at
the
rest
of
his
confused
and
uncomfortable
family
there
is
not
much
cheerful
society
to
be
had
here
this
evening
i
perceive
he
said
it
is
pleasant
to
come
in
from
one
cares
and
find
a
reception
like
this
do
you
think
let
some
one
bring
me
some
coffee
to
my
study
i
am
going
to
write
whose
fault
is
it
that
he
gets
such
a
reception
burst
forth
janey
the
moment
her
father
had
closed
the
door
who
does
it
all
i
wonder
who
treats
us
like
a
set
of
wretches
without
any
feeling
i
ca
hush
i
wo
hush
oh
should
i
be
glad
to
go
out
as
a
housemaid
to
do
anything
oh
janey
hush
we
ca
help
ourselves
we
are
obliged
to
put
up
with
it
said
ursula
but
reginald
he
is
not
obliged
he
can
save
himself
when
he
likes
oh
i
know
i
know
papa
is
unreasonable
but
reginald
are
you
a
little
bit
unreasonable
too
do
you
begin
to
reproach
me
cried
the
young
man
i
have
had
enough
for
one
day
have
i
been
such
a
charge
upon
him
ursula
what
has
he
spent
upon
me
next
to
nothing
that
tailor
bill
he
spoke
of
he
knew
as
well
as
i
do
that
i
paid
it
by
the
tutorship
i
had
in
the
vacation
it
is
his
bill
that
is
not
paid
not
mine
and
then
money
oh
never
mind
that
never
mind
the
past
cried
ursula
think
of
the
present
that
what
you
ought
to
do
oh
reginald
think
if
had
the
chance
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
for
it
i
would
scrub
floors
as
he
said
i
would
do
anything
the
dirtiest
work
you
will
be
independent
able
to
do
what
you
please
and
never
to
ask
papa
for
anything
reginald
think
oh
dear
dear
i
wish
i
knew
how
to
talk
to
you
to
be
independent
able
to
please
yourself
i
shall
be
independent
anyhow
after
he
said
ursula
you
will
help
me
to
pack
my
things
wo
you
it
is
leaving
you
here
you
girls
with
nobody
to
stand
up
for
you
it
is
that
i
feel
most
oh
reginald
do
go
and
leave
us
cried
janey
leaning
on
the
back
of
his
chair
what
can
we
do
without
you
when
he
comes
in
in
a
rage
like
as
long
as
you
are
here
one
can
bear
it
oh
reginald
ca
you
ca
you
take
the
chaplaincy
think
what
it
would
be
for
us
yes
i
will
pack
your
things
said
ursula
i
will
help
you
to
get
out
of
it
though
we
must
stay
and
put
up
with
it
all
and
never
never
escape
but
where
will
you
go
you
have
no
money
not
enough
scarcely
to
pay
your
railway
fare
you
would
have
to
take
to
teaching
and
where
are
you
to
go
i
have
some
friends
left
cried
reginald
his
lips
quivering
some
people
care
for
me
still
and
would
hold
out
a
hand
i
am
not
quite
so
badly
off
as
he
thinks
i
could
go
to
town
or
to
oxford
or
you
do
know
where
and
here
is
a
nice
house
all
ready
for
you
to
step
into
and
an
income
cried
ursula
her
tone
deepening
to
mark
the
capital
letter
an
income
quite
sure
and
ready
without
any
difficulty
without
any
trouble
all
if
you
say
yes
oh
only
think
what
a
comfort
for
us
all
to
be
able
to
rush
to
you
when
we
are
in
trouble
think
of
johnnie
and
robin
and
that
delightful
wainscoted
room
for
your
study
with
the
all
ready
and
plenty
of
money
to
buy
books
this
being
the
highest
point
to
which
ursula
could
reach
she
dropped
down
after
it
into
an
insinuating
half
whisper
and
plenty
of
work
to
do
dear
reginald
plenty
of
work
in
the
parish
you
may
be
sure
if
you
will
only
help
the
rector
or
here
where
you
are
working
already
and
where
you
may
be
sure
nobody
will
think
of
paying
you
oh
reginald
there
is
plenty
plenty
of
work
the
young
man
was
already
beginning
to
melt
do
you
think
so
he
said
think
cried
janey
i
am
sure
you
may
do
all
papa
work
for
him
and
welcome
if
that
is
all
for
my
part
i
think
you
are
very
silly
both
ursula
and
you
work
pay
is
far
better
if
you
were
such
a
pair
of
simpletons
after
all
he
has
a
little
reason
to
be
angry
good
gracious
why
should
you
take
it
some
one
else
will
if
you
wo
i
would
in
a
minute
and
so
would
ursula
if
we
could
and
why
should
you
be
so
much
grander
than
anybody
else
i
think
it
is
quite
childish
for
my
part
reginald
never
mind
her
she
is
only
a
child
and
does
understand
yourself
cried
janey
i
do
understand
very
well
but
still
i
can
see
what
you
want
oh
you
might
find
such
quantities
of
work
things
nobody
is
ever
found
to
do
what
do
the
fellows
do
at
oxford
that
they
get
that
money
for
i
have
heard
you
say
you
would
be
very
glad
to
get
a
fellowship
that
is
different
that
is
a
reward
of
scholarship
well
and
so
is
this
too
said
ursula
it
is
i
am
sure
because
the
old
men
knew
you
were
one
that
would
be
kind
you
were
always
kind
reginald
that
is
what
it
is
for
the
old
men
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
said
shaking
his
head
it
is
the
corporation
and
they
are
very
rich
men
reginald
dear
a
great
many
of
them
very
sensible
what
does
it
matter
about
their
education
and
then
you
would
be
a
really
educated
man
always
ready
to
do
anything
that
was
wanted
in
carlingford
do
you
see
that
was
their
meaning
they
pay
you
for
that
which
is
not
work
but
they
will
find
you
plenty
of
work
they
do
pay
for
that
is
what
they
mean
and
oh
reginald
to
run
over
to
you
there
in
that
pretty
wainscoted
room
and
to
have
you
coming
in
to
us
every
day
and
to
know
that
you
were
there
to
stand
by
us
here
once
more
ursula
began
to
cry
as
for
janey
she
made
a
dash
at
the
and
brought
him
paper
and
pens
and
ink
say
yes
say
yes
she
cried
oh
reginald
if
it
was
only
to
spite
papa
chapter
xvi
the
new
gentleman
it
seems
difficult
to
imagine
what
connection
there
could
be
between
phoebe
beecham
appearance
in
grange
lane
and
the
interview
which
took
place
there
between
her
and
the
new
gentleman
and
may
sudden
onslaught
upon
his
family
which
ended
in
reginald
acceptance
of
the
chaplaincy
but
yet
the
connection
was
very
distinct
not
even
the
mays
in
their
excitement
over
the
appearance
of
a
stranger
in
carlingford
could
be
more
surprised
than
phoebe
was
when
her
solitary
walk
was
interrupted
by
the
apparition
across
the
street
of
a
known
person
a
face
familiar
to
her
in
other
regions
mr
northcote
she
cried
with
a
little
start
of
surprise
as
for
the
stranger
he
made
but
two
steps
across
grange
lane
in
his
delight
at
the
sight
of
her
not
that
he
was
phoebe
lover
or
possessed
by
any
previous
enthusiasm
for
the
girl
whom
he
had
met
about
times
in
his
life
and
of
whom
he
knew
little
more
than
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
brother
clergyman
for
both
beecham
and
he
were
in
the
habit
of
using
that
word
whether
appropriate
or
inappropriate
this
was
the
explanation
of
the
white
necktie
and
the
formal
dress
which
had
puzzled
ursula
horace
northcote
was
not
of
beecham
class
he
was
not
and
genial
bent
upon
keeping
up
his
congregation
and
his
popularity
and
trying
to
ignore
as
much
as
he
could
the
social
superiority
of
the
church
without
making
himself
in
any
way
offensive
to
her
he
was
a
political
nonconformist
a
vigorous
champion
of
the
disestablishment
society
more
successful
on
the
platform
than
in
the
pulpit
and
strenuously
of
opinion
in
his
heart
of
hearts
that
the
church
was
the
great
drawback
to
all
progress
in
england
an
incubus
of
which
the
nation
would
gladly
be
rid
his
dress
was
one
of
the
signs
of
his
character
and
meaning
strong
in
a
sense
of
his
own
clerical
position
he
believed
in
uniform
as
devoutly
as
any
ritualist
but
he
would
not
plagiarise
the
anglican
livery
and
walk
about
in
a
modified
soutane
and
round
hat
like
our
brethren
in
the
established
church
as
beecham
kindly
called
them
to
young
northcote
they
were
not
brethren
but
enemies
and
though
he
smiled
superior
at
the
folly
which
stigmatised
an
waistcoat
yet
he
scorned
to
copy
accordingly
his
frock
coat
was
not
long
but
of
the
extremest
solemnity
of
cut
and
hue
his
white
tie
was
of
the
stiffest
his
tall
hat
of
the
most
uncompromising
character
he
would
not
veil
for
a
day
in
easier
and
more
ordinary
habiliments
the
distinct
position
he
assumed
as
clerical
yet
not
of
the
clergy
a
teacher
of
men
though
not
a
priest
of
the
anglican
inspiration
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
his
appearance
as
he
moved
about
the
streets
was
one
which
might
well
thrill
anglican
bosoms
with
a
flutter
of
terror
he
was
the
church
avowed
enemy
and
upon
this
he
stood
as
his
claim
to
the
honour
of
those
who
thought
with
him
this
was
very
different
from
the
views
held
by
the
pastor
of
the
crescent
chapel
who
was
very
willing
to
be
on
the
best
terms
with
the
church
and
would
have
liked
to
glide
into
closer
and
closer
amity
and
perhaps
finally
to
melt
away
altogether
in
her
broad
bosom
like
a
fat
raindrop
contributing
noiselessly
to
swell
the
sea
it
was
not
however
any
feeling
of
this
difference
which
made
phoebe
draw
herself
back
instinctively
after
the
first
start
of
recognition
across
her
mind
even
while
she
held
out
her
hand
to
the
stranger
there
flashed
a
sudden
recollection
of
her
grandmother
and
her
grandfather
and
all
the
homely
belongings
which
he
a
minister
of
the
connection
could
not
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
it
was
but
a
momentary
pang
phoebe
was
not
so
foolish
as
to
shrink
before
the
inevitable
or
to
attempt
by
foolish
expedients
to
stave
off
such
a
danger
she
shrank
for
a
second
then
drew
herself
up
and
shook
off
all
such
ignoble
cares
i
am
myself
whatever
happens
was
her
reflection
and
she
said
with
something
like
security
i
am
so
glad
to
meet
you
northcote
what
an
unexpected
pleasure
to
see
you
here
it
is
a
most
unexpected
pleasure
for
me
i
assure
you
he
said
and
a
very
great
one
he
spoke
with
unaffected
honesty
for
indeed
his
plunge
into
the
society
of
salem
chapel
had
given
him
a
shock
not
easily
got
over
and
the
appearance
of
a
being
of
his
own
species
among
all
these
excellent
poulterers
and
grocers
was
a
relief
unspeakable
and
then
he
added
may
i
walk
with
you
if
you
are
going
to
walk
surely
said
phoebe
with
momentary
hesitation
and
it
was
just
at
this
moment
that
she
perceived
ursula
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
glad
of
the
diversion
waved
her
hand
to
her
and
said
how
do
you
do
a
friend
of
yours
said
northcote
following
her
gesture
with
his
eyes
and
feeling
more
and
more
glad
that
he
had
met
her
i
passed
those
young
ladies
just
now
and
heard
some
of
their
conversation
which
amused
me
do
they
belong
to
our
people
if
you
will
not
be
angry
miss
beecham
i
must
say
that
i
should
be
glad
to
meet
somebody
belonging
to
us
who
is
not
who
is
more
like
the
people
one
meets
elsewhere
well
said
phoebe
we
are
always
talking
of
wanting
something
original
i
think
on
the
whole
i
am
of
your
opinion
still
there
is
nothing
very
great
or
striking
about
most
of
the
people
one
meets
anywhere
yes
society
is
flat
enough
said
the
young
man
but
it
is
strange
and
rather
painful
though
perhaps
it
is
wrong
to
say
so
why
i
wonder
are
all
our
people
of
one
class
perhaps
you
have
not
seen
much
of
them
here
all
of
one
class
and
that
not
an
attractive
class
said
phoebe
with
a
little
sigh
yes
i
know
anything
but
an
attractive
class
not
the
working
men
and
such
like
one
can
get
on
with
them
it
is
very
unpleasant
to
have
to
say
it
buying
and
selling
now
as
we
have
it
in
manchester
does
not
contract
the
mind
i
suppose
we
all
buy
and
sell
more
and
less
how
is
it
when
it
is
tea
and
sugar
or
butter
and
cheese
said
phoebe
with
a
laugh
which
she
could
not
quite
keep
from
embarrassment
i
must
be
honest
and
tell
you
before
you
go
any
further
you
do
know
that
i
belong
to
the
tozers
northcote
who
are
in
that
line
of
business
do
look
so
dreadfully
distressed
perhaps
i
should
have
told
you
had
you
not
been
sure
to
find
out
old
tozer
is
my
grandfather
and
i
am
staying
there
it
is
quite
simple
papa
came
to
carlingford
when
he
was
a
young
clergyman
newly
ordained
he
was
pastor
at
salem
chapel
and
married
mamma
who
was
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
chief
members
i
did
not
know
myself
when
i
came
to
carlingford
that
they
actually
kept
a
shop
and
i
did
not
like
it
do
apologize
please
it
is
a
very
difficult
question
said
phoebe
philosophically
partly
to
ease
herself
partly
to
set
him
at
his
ease
what
is
best
to
do
in
such
a
case
to
be
educated
in
another
sphere
and
brought
down
to
this
is
hard
one
can
not
feel
the
same
for
one
relations
and
yet
one
poor
little
bit
of
education
one
petty
manners
what
are
these
to
interfere
with
blood
relationships
and
to
keep
everybody
down
to
the
condition
they
were
born
why
that
is
the
old
way
miss
beecham
i
do
know
what
to
say
i
never
meant
i
could
not
tell
there
are
excellent
most
excellent
people
in
all
classes
exactly
so
said
phoebe
with
a
laugh
we
all
know
that
one
man
is
as
good
as
another
if
not
better
a
butterman
is
as
good
as
a
lord
but
she
added
with
a
little
elevation
of
her
eyebrows
and
shrug
of
her
shoulders
not
so
pleasant
to
be
connected
with
and
you
do
say
anything
about
my
difficulty
northcote
you
do
realize
it
perhaps
as
i
do
which
is
best
for
everybody
to
continue
in
the
position
he
was
born
in
or
for
an
honest
shopkeeper
to
educate
his
children
and
push
them
up
higher
until
they
come
to
feel
themselves
members
of
a
different
class
and
to
be
ashamed
of
him
either
way
you
know
it
is
hard
northcote
was
at
his
wit
end
he
had
no
for
this
difficulty
his
friends
were
all
much
better
off
than
he
was
as
a
poor
minister
they
were
manchester
people
with
two
or
three
generations
of
wealth
behind
them
relations
of
whom
nobody
need
be
ashamed
and
he
was
himself
deeply
humiliated
and
distressed
to
have
said
anything
which
could
humiliate
phoebe
who
rose
immeasurably
in
his
estimation
in
consequence
of
her
bold
avowal
though
he
himself
would
have
sacrificed
a
great
deal
rather
than
put
himself
on
the
tozer
level
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
miss
beecham
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
how
falsely
our
opinions
are
formed
in
this
respect
how
conventional
we
are
what
is
position
after
all
to
a
grand
seigneur
for
instance
the
difference
between
his
steward
and
his
laquais
seems
nothing
but
to
the
steward
it
is
a
great
gulf
i
i
mean
the
whole
question
is
conventional
position
or
station
or
rank
phoebe
smiled
i
do
think
that
is
quite
the
question
she
said
but
never
mind
i
suppose
you
are
here
on
some
mission
you
would
not
come
to
carlingford
for
pleasure
nay
said
northcote
with
a
reproachful
tone
i
should
have
thought
you
must
have
heard
of
our
meeting
it
is
for
i
have
come
from
the
disestablishment
society
with
some
other
friends
but
it
has
been
my
fate
to
come
on
before
to
make
the
arrangements
the
others
come
a
hard
fate
mr
northcote
i
thought
so
this
morning
i
have
not
been
much
in
the
way
of
the
country
congregations
i
was
confounded
but
miss
beecham
i
no
longer
think
my
fate
hard
since
i
have
met
you
your
noble
simplicity
and
frankness
have
taught
me
a
lesson
it
is
not
noble
at
all
said
phoebe
if
i
had
not
been
sure
you
must
find
out
i
should
have
said
nothing
about
it
now
i
fear
i
must
turn
back
but
you
will
come
to
the
meeting
he
said
turning
with
her
he
felt
it
necessary
to
be
obsequious
to
phoebe
after
the
terrible
mistake
he
had
made
not
unless
grandpapa
insists
i
should
like
to
hear
your
speech
said
phoebe
but
i
do
object
to
the
established
church
as
you
do
neither
does
papa
when
you
push
him
hard
i
do
think
england
would
be
much
nicer
if
we
were
all
dissenters
to
be
sure
we
might
be
more
civil
to
each
other
if
there
were
no
dissenters
you
mean
it
comes
to
much
the
same
thing
congregations
are
not
pleasant
masters
are
they
northcote
i
know
some
people
one
at
least
said
phoebe
who
is
often
very
insolent
to
papa
and
we
have
to
put
up
with
it
for
the
sake
of
peace
papa
says
i
do
think
in
the
church
that
any
leading
member
could
be
so
insolent
to
a
clergyman
that
is
perhaps
rather
forgive
me
a
narrow
personal
view
wait
till
you
get
a
charge
and
have
to
please
the
congregation
and
the
leading
members
cried
phoebe
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
it
is
just
like
a
woman
to
look
at
a
public
question
so
very
well
after
all
women
are
half
the
world
and
their
opinion
is
as
good
as
another
i
have
the
greatest
respect
for
your
opinion
said
young
northcote
but
we
must
not
think
of
individual
grievances
the
system
with
all
its
wrongs
is
what
occupies
me
i
have
heard
something
even
here
this
very
day
what
is
it
my
good
friend
i
am
busy
now
another
time
or
if
you
want
me
my
lodgings
are
a
glance
half
of
pain
half
of
fun
came
into
phoebe
eyes
it
is
grandpapa
she
said
you
should
speak
in
that
tone
sir
not
to
your
elders
and
maybe
your
betters
said
tozer
in
his
greasy
old
coat
ministers
take
a
deal
upon
them
but
an
old
member
like
me
and
one
as
has
stood
by
the
connection
through
thick
and
thin
ai
the
one
to
be
called
your
good
friend
well
if
you
begs
pardon
of
course
there
ai
no
more
to
be
said
and
if
you
know
our
phoebe
phoebe
junior
as
i
calls
her
what
of
the
meeting
northcote
i
hope
you
give
it
them
church
folks
and
strong
sir
they
do
give
themselves
airs
to
be
sure
in
carlingford
most
of
our
folks
is
timid
seeing
for
one
thing
as
their
best
customers
belong
to
the
church
that
do
touch
me
not
said
tozer
with
a
laugh
not
that
i
was
ever
one
as
concealed
my
convictions
i
hope
you
give
it
and
strong
i
shall
say
what
i
think
said
the
young
man
bewildered
he
was
by
no
means
broken
into
the
ways
of
the
connection
and
his
pride
rebelled
at
the
idea
of
being
schooled
by
this
old
shopkeeper
but
the
sight
of
phoebe
standing
by
not
only
checked
his
rebellious
sentiments
but
filled
him
with
a
sympathetic
thrill
of
feeling
what
it
must
be
for
that
girl
to
own
this
old
man
to
live
with
him
and
feel
herself
shut
into
his
society
and
friends
of
his
choosing
to
hear
herself
spoken
of
as
phoebe
junior
the
idea
made
him
shiver
and
this
caught
old
tozer
always
hospitable
eye
you
chilly
he
said
and
i
do
wonder
after
the
dreadful
weather
we
had
few
passes
my
door
without
a
bite
or
a
sup
specially
at
mr
which
is
sociable
time
as
i
always
says
come
in
and
warm
yourself
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
there
is
nothing
as
pleases
my
old
woman
so
much
as
to
get
out
her
best
for
a
minister
she
a
great
respect
for
ministers
has
tozer
sir
and
now
she
got
phoebe
to
show
off
as
well
as
the
chiney
come
along
sir
i
ca
take
no
refusal
it
just
our
time
for
tea
northcote
made
an
unavailing
attempt
to
get
away
but
partly
it
appeared
to
him
that
to
refuse
the
invitation
might
look
to
phoebe
like
a
pretence
of
superiority
on
his
part
and
partly
he
was
interested
in
herself
and
was
very
well
aware
he
should
get
no
company
so
good
in
carlingford
even
with
the
drawback
of
the
old
among
whom
she
lived
how
strange
it
was
to
see
her
in
the
dress
of
which
sam
hurst
had
raved
and
of
which
even
the
young
nonconformist
vaguely
divined
the
excellence
putting
her
hand
upon
old
tozer
greasy
sleeve
walking
home
with
the
shuffling
old
man
about
whose
social
position
no
one
could
make
the
least
mistake
he
turned
with
them
with
a
sensation
of
thankfulness
that
it
was
in
grange
lane
carlingford
where
nobody
knew
him
as
for
phoebe
no
such
comfort
was
in
her
mind
everybody
knew
her
here
or
rather
everybody
knew
old
tozer
no
disguise
was
possible
to
her
the
only
way
to
redeem
the
position
was
to
carry
it
with
a
high
hand
as
she
did
holding
her
head
erect
and
playing
her
part
so
that
all
the
world
might
see
and
wonder
i
think
you
had
better
come
northcote
and
have
some
tea
she
said
graciously
when
the
young
man
was
floundering
in
efforts
to
excuse
himself
old
tozer
chuckled
and
rubbed
his
hands
take
phoebe
advice
he
said
phoebe
the
sensiblest
girl
i
know
so
was
her
mother
before
her
as
married
one
of
the
most
popular
preachers
in
the
connection
though
i
say
it
as
should
my
old
woman
always
said
as
our
phoebe
was
cut
out
for
a
minister
wife
and
phoebe
just
such
another
cried
the
admiring
grandfather
heavens
above
did
this
mean
traps
and
snares
for
himself
or
did
the
old
shopkeeper
think
of
him
horace
northcote
as
another
possible
victim
if
he
had
but
known
with
what
sincere
compassionate
toleration
phoebe
regarded
him
as
a
young
man
whom
she
might
be
kind
to
he
might
have
been
saved
all
alarm
on
this
point
the
idea
that
a
small
undistinguished
dissenting
minister
should
think
her
capable
of
marrying
him
was
a
humiliation
which
did
not
enter
into
phoebe
head
chapter
xvii
a
public
meeting
phoebe
philosophy
however
was
put
to
the
test
when
after
the
young
pastor
had
taken
tea
and
got
himself
away
from
the
pressing
hospitalities
of
the
tozers
her
grandfather
also
disappeared
to
put
on
his
best
coat
in
order
to
attend
the
meeting
tozer
left
alone
with
her
granddaughter
immediately
proceeded
to
evolve
her
views
as
to
what
phoebe
was
expected
to
do
i
never
see
you
out
o
that
brown
thing
phoebe
she
said
ai
you
got
a
silk
dress
child
or
something
that
looks
a
bit
i
have
thought
your
mother
would
have
took
more
pride
in
you
surely
you
got
a
silk
dress
oh
yes
more
than
one
said
phoebe
but
this
is
considered
in
better
taste
taste
whose
taste
cried
the
old
lady
my
phoebe
did
ought
to
care
for
them
dingy
things
for
i
sure
she
never
got
no
such
example
from
me
i
always
liked
what
was
if
it
was
only
a
print
a
nice
blue
silk
now
or
a
bright
green
is
what
you
look
pretty
in
with
your
complexion
go
now
there
a
dear
and
put
on
something
very
nice
something
as
will
show
a
bit
you
going
with
your
grandfather
to
this
meeting
to
the
meeting
oh
i
hope
not
said
phoebe
with
fervour
and
why
should
you
hope
not
is
it
natural
as
a
young
creature
like
you
should
get
out
a
bit
when
she
can
and
see
what
to
be
seen
i
do
hold
with
girls
moping
in
a
house
besides
it
very
instructive
as
i
always
heard
and
you
as
is
clever
of
course
you
understand
every
word
northcote
is
a
sort
of
young
man
ministers
may
be
much
said
tozer
though
just
see
how
your
papa
has
got
on
my
dear
nobody
else
as
phoebe
could
have
married
would
have
got
up
in
the
world
like
that
you
may
make
a
deal
more
money
in
trade
but
it
ai
so
genteel
there
always
that
to
be
said
now
just
as
well
as
you
should
have
your
chance
with
the
rest
and
let
yourself
be
seen
phoebe
run
there
a
darling
and
put
on
something
bright
and
a
nice
lace
collar
you
can
have
mine
if
you
like
i
should
grudge
nothing
not
a
single
thing
i
got
to
see
you
looking
as
nice
as
the
best
there
and
so
you
will
if
you
take
a
little
pains
i
do
up
my
hair
a
bit
higher
if
i
was
you
why
phoebe
i
declare
you
have
got
a
single
pad
now
what
is
the
use
of
neglecting
yourself
and
letting
others
get
ahead
of
you
like
that
pads
are
going
out
of
fashion
grandmamma
said
phoebe
gravely
so
are
bright
colours
for
dresses
you
ca
think
what
funny
shades
we
wear
in
town
but
must
i
go
to
this
meeting
i
should
not
like
to
leave
you
alone
it
is
so
much
nicer
for
me
to
be
here
you
a
good
girl
you
are
said
tozer
admiringly
and
me
as
was
frightened
for
a
fine
lady
from
london
but
tozer
would
say
as
it
was
my
doing
he
would
say
as
it
was
natural
for
a
young
creature
and
bless
you
they
all
be
there
in
their
best
that
pigeon
and
the
others
and
tom
i
just
wish
i
could
go
too
to
see
you
outshine
all
which
you
do
if
you
take
pains
take
a
little
more
pains
with
your
hair
phoebe
mount
it
up
a
bit
higher
and
if
you
want
anything
like
a
bit
of
lace
or
a
brooch
or
that
just
you
come
to
me
i
should
like
tom
to
see
you
with
that
brooch
as
she
always
wanting
for
minnie
now
why
should
i
give
my
brooch
to
minnie
i
do
see
no
reason
for
it
for
my
part
certainly
not
grandmamma
said
phoebe
you
must
wear
your
brooches
yourself
that
is
what
i
like
a
great
deal
better
than
giving
them
either
to
minnie
or
me
ah
but
there
ai
a
many
like
you
my
sweet
cried
the
old
woman
wiping
her
eyes
you
my
phoebe
own
daughter
but
you
a
touch
above
her
my
darling
and
us
too
that
what
you
are
run
now
and
dress
or
i
do
know
what
tozer
will
say
to
me
he
set
his
heart
on
showing
you
off
thus
adjured
phoebe
went
away
reluctantly
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
her
disinterestedness
about
her
grandmother
brooch
was
not
perhaps
so
noble
as
it
appeared
on
the
outside
the
article
in
question
was
a
kind
of
small
in
a
very
fine
solid
gold
mount
set
with
large
pink
topazes
and
enclosing
little
wavy
curls
of
hair
one
from
the
head
of
each
young
tozer
of
the
last
generation
it
was
a
piece
of
jewelry
very
well
known
in
carlingford
and
the
panic
which
rose
in
bosom
when
it
was
offered
for
her
own
personal
adornment
is
more
easily
imagined
than
described
she
went
upstairs
feeling
that
she
had
escaped
and
took
out
a
black
silk
dress
at
which
she
looked
lovingly
but
grandmamma
would
think
it
was
no
better
than
this
she
said
to
herself
and
after
much
searchings
of
heart
she
chose
a
costume
of
venetian
blue
one
soft
tint
dying
into
another
like
the
lustre
on
a
piece
of
old
glass
which
in
her
own
opinion
was
a
great
deal
too
good
for
the
occasion
some
one
will
tread
on
it
to
a
certainty
and
the
colours
do
show
in
but
i
must
try
to
please
grandmamma
she
said
heroically
when
it
was
put
on
with
puffings
of
lace
such
as
tozer
had
never
seen
and
was
entirely
ignorant
of
the
value
of
at
the
throat
and
sleeves
phoebe
wrapt
a
shawl
round
her
in
something
of
the
same
dim
gorgeous
hue
covered
with
embroidery
an
indian
rarity
which
somebody
had
bestowed
upon
beecham
and
which
no
one
had
used
or
thought
of
till
phoebe
artistic
eye
fell
upon
it
it
was
a
great
deal
too
fine
for
carlingford
an
bought
in
oxford
street
for
a
pound
or
two
would
have
much
more
impressed
the
assembly
to
which
phoebe
was
bound
tozer
inspected
her
when
she
went
downstairs
with
awe
yet
dissatisfaction
i
dare
say
as
it
all
very
fine
and
it
ai
like
other
folks
anybody
can
see
but
i
dress
you
different
my
dear
if
you
was
in
my
hands
said
the
old
woman
walking
round
and
round
her
as
for
tozer
he
too
showed
less
admiration
than
if
he
had
known
better
i
got
a
fly
thinking
as
you
have
some
fallal
or
other
on
you
but
bless
my
heart
you
could
have
walked
in
that
gown
he
said
so
that
phoebe
toilette
which
would
have
been
mightily
admired
in
a
london
could
not
be
said
to
be
a
success
she
was
somewhat
discouraged
by
this
notwithstanding
that
she
knew
so
very
much
better
and
accordingly
set
out
in
the
fly
with
her
grandfather
in
his
best
coat
feeling
generally
in
a
depressed
condition
it
is
clear
that
i
must
take
to
the
pinks
and
blues
to
please
them
she
said
to
herself
with
a
sigh
she
could
triumph
over
the
slight
that
might
be
shown
to
herself
in
consequence
of
her
relations
but
those
sneers
at
her
dress
went
to
phoebe
heart
the
music
hall
was
full
of
a
miscellaneous
crowd
when
phoebe
following
her
grandfather
went
in
and
the
seats
allotted
to
these
important
people
were
on
the
platform
where
at
least
tozer
unacknowledged
object
of
showing
her
off
could
be
amply
gratified
this
arrangement
did
not
on
the
whole
displease
phoebe
since
she
must
be
exhibited
it
seemed
better
on
the
whole
to
be
exhibited
there
than
in
a
less
distinguished
place
and
all
the
speakers
knew
her
which
was
something
she
sat
down
with
some
complaisance
and
let
her
indian
scarf
droop
from
her
shoulders
and
her
pretty
dress
show
itself
i
declare
if
that
is
phoebe
junior
said
tom
audibly
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
making
a
show
of
herself
but
lord
bless
us
for
all
their
grandeur
how
she
do
dress
to
be
sure
a
bit
of
a
rag
of
an
old
shawl
and
a
hat
on
the
same
as
she
wears
every
day
i
got
more
respect
for
them
as
comes
to
instruct
us
than
that
and
indeed
tom
was
resplendent
in
a
red
de
with
a
brooch
almost
as
big
as
that
envied
one
of
tozer
stuck
into
her
gown
and
a
cap
covered
with
flowers
upon
her
head
this
was
the
usual
fashion
of
the
salem
ladies
on
such
rare
occasions
the
meeting
of
the
disestablishment
society
was
to
them
what
a
ball
is
to
persons
who
frequent
such
vanities
the
leading
families
came
out
to
see
and
to
be
seen
it
would
be
wrong
to
say
that
they
did
not
enter
into
all
the
arguments
and
recognise
the
intellectual
feast
set
before
them
no
doubt
they
did
this
just
as
well
as
if
they
had
come
in
their
commonest
attire
but
still
the
seriousness
of
the
occasion
was
no
doubt
modified
by
being
thus
made
into
a
dissipation
the
men
were
not
so
fine
perhaps
because
it
is
more
difficult
for
men
to
be
fine
but
they
were
all
in
their
sunday
clothes
and
the
younger
ones
were
in
full
bloom
of
coloured
satin
cravats
and
fine
waistcoats
some
of
them
were
almost
as
fine
a
sight
as
the
ladies
in
their
ribbons
and
flowers
i
suppose
by
the
look
of
them
this
must
be
an
influential
community
people
of
some
pretensions
said
an
obese
elderly
minister
who
had
seated
himself
by
phoebe
and
whose
eyes
were
dazzled
by
the
display
i
never
expected
all
this
dress
in
a
quiet
country
place
oh
yes
they
are
people
of
much
pretension
said
phoebe
gravely
and
then
the
proceedings
began
old
green
the
grocer
whose
son
had
married
maria
pigeon
and
who
had
long
been
retired
from
business
occupying
a
house
in
the
country
and
driving
his
carriage
was
in
the
chair
and
the
proceedings
went
on
according
to
the
routine
of
such
assemblies
with
differing
degrees
of
earnestness
on
the
part
of
the
speakers
to
most
of
these
gentlemen
it
was
the
ordinary
occupation
of
their
lives
and
they
made
their
hearers
laugh
at
stories
and
enjoyed
their
own
wit
and
elicited
familiar
cheers
and
made
hits
such
as
they
had
made
for
years
on
the
same
subject
which
was
a
comfortable
de
not
at
all
exciting
to
themselves
though
they
were
quite
willing
to
excite
their
audience
if
that
audience
would
allow
itself
to
be
excited
things
jogged
on
thus
for
the
first
hour
very
pleasantly
the
meeting
was
not
excited
but
it
was
amused
and
enjoyed
itself
it
was
an
intellectual
treat
as
pigeon
said
to
brown
and
if
the
younger
people
did
not
like
it
so
well
as
they
would
have
liked
a
ball
the
elder
people
liked
it
a
great
deal
better
and
the
hall
rang
with
applause
and
with
laughter
as
one
speaker
succeeded
another
it
was
pleasant
to
know
how
unstable
the
church
was
on
her
foundation
that
aristocratical
church
which
looked
down
upon
dissent
and
of
which
the
poorest
adherent
gave
himself
airs
much
above
chapel
folks
and
how
much
loftier
a
position
the
nonconformist
held
who
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
state
support
for
my
part
said
one
of
the
speakers
i
would
rather
abandon
my
sacred
calling
or
make
tents
as
paul
did
in
its
exercise
than
put
on
the
gilded
fetters
of
the
state
and
pray
or
preach
as
an
archbishop
told
me
nay
as
a
cabinet
council
of
godless
worldlings
directed
there
are
many
good
men
among
the
clergy
of
the
church
of
england
but
they
are
slaves
my
friends
nothing
but
slaves
dragged
at
the
chariot
wheels
of
the
state
ruled
by
a
caste
of
lawyers
or
binding
themselves
in
the
rotten
robes
of
tradition
it
is
we
only
who
can
dare
to
say
that
we
are
free
at
this
sentiment
the
meeting
fairly
shouted
with
applause
and
delight
and
and
the
speaker
delighted
too
and
tasting
all
the
sweetness
of
success
gave
place
to
the
next
and
came
and
sat
down
by
phoebe
to
whose
society
the
younger
men
were
all
very
glad
to
escape
miss
beecham
you
are
fashionably
calm
whispered
the
orator
you
do
throw
yourself
like
the
rest
of
us
into
this
great
agitation
have
you
a
leading
member
whispered
phoebe
back
again
and
does
he
never
drag
you
at
his
chariot
wheels
have
you
deacons
that
keep
you
up
to
the
mark
have
you
people
you
must
drink
tea
with
when
they
ask
you
or
else
they
throw
up
their
sittings
i
am
thinking
of
course
of
papa
have
i
deacons
have
i
leading
members
miss
beecham
you
are
cruel
hush
said
phoebe
settling
herself
in
her
chair
here
is
somebody
who
is
in
dreadful
earnest
do
talk
northcote
is
going
to
speak
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
the
minister
daughter
played
her
of
fine
lady
and
very
fairly
in
an
atmosphere
so
unlike
the
air
that
fine
ladies
breathe
phoebe
paid
no
more
attention
to
the
discomfited
man
at
her
elbow
she
gathered
up
her
shawl
in
her
hand
with
a
seeming
careless
movement
and
let
it
drop
lightly
across
her
knee
where
the
gold
threads
in
the
embroidery
caught
the
light
and
she
took
off
her
hat
which
she
had
thought
proper
to
wear
to
show
her
sense
that
the
meeting
was
not
an
evening
party
and
prepared
herself
to
listen
her
complexion
and
her
hair
and
the
gold
threads
in
the
rich
indian
work
thus
blazed
out
together
upon
the
startled
audience
many
of
them
were
as
much
struck
by
this
as
by
the
beginning
of
speech
though
it
was
very
different
from
the
other
speeches
the
others
had
been
routine
agitation
this
was
fiery
conviction
crude
and
jumping
at
conclusions
but
still
an
enthusiasm
in
its
way
northcote
approached
his
subject
gradually
and
his
hearers
at
first
disappointed
by
the
absence
of
their
familiar
were
dull
and
bestowed
their
attention
on
phoebe
but
before
he
had
been
speaking
ten
minutes
phoebe
was
forgotten
even
by
her
uncle
and
aunt
the
two
people
most
interested
in
her
it
would
be
dangerous
to
repeat
to
a
reader
probably
quite
uninterested
in
the
controversy
speech
in
which
he
laid
hold
of
some
of
those
weak
points
which
the
church
of
course
has
in
common
with
every
other
institution
in
the
world
eloquence
has
a
way
of
evaporating
in
print
even
when
the
report
is
immediate
but
his
peroration
was
one
which
startled
his
hearers
out
of
a
calm
abstract
interest
to
all
that
keen
personal
feeling
which
accompanies
the
narrative
of
facts
known
to
an
audience
and
affecting
people
within
their
own
locality
i
have
only
been
in
this
place
three
days
said
the
speaker
but
in
that
short
time
i
have
heard
of
one
of
the
most
flagrant
abuses
which
i
have
been
indicating
to
you
there
is
in
this
town
as
you
all
know
an
institution
called
the
college
what
was
its
original
object
i
do
not
know
nests
of
idle
pauperism
genteelly
veiled
under
such
a
name
do
exist
i
know
over
all
the
country
but
it
is
at
least
probable
that
some
educational
purpose
was
in
the
mind
of
the
pious
founder
who
established
it
the
pious
founder
how
immense
are
the
revenues
how
incalculable
the
means
of
doing
good
which
have
been
locked
up
in
uselessness
or
worse
than
uselessness
by
men
who
have
purchased
a
pass
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
at
the
last
moment
by
such
gifts
and
become
pious
founders
just
before
they
ceased
to
be
miserable
sinners
whatever
may
have
been
the
original
intention
of
the
college
however
it
is
clear
that
it
was
meant
for
something
more
than
the
pitiful
use
it
is
put
to
now
this
old
foundation
ladies
and
gentlemen
which
might
provide
half
the
poor
children
in
carlingford
with
a
wholesome
education
is
devoted
to
the
maintenance
of
six
old
men
need
i
say
churchmen
here
the
speaker
was
interrupted
by
mingled
hisses
and
ironical
hear
hears
and
a
chaplain
to
say
their
prayers
for
them
six
old
men
and
one
parson
to
say
their
prayers
for
them
what
do
you
think
of
this
my
friends
i
understand
that
this
heavy
and
onerous
duty
has
been
offered
not
to
some
other
mouldy
old
gentleman
some
decayed
clergyman
who
might
have
ministered
in
peace
to
the
decayed
old
burghers
without
any
interference
on
my
part
for
a
refuge
for
the
aged
and
destitute
has
something
natural
in
it
even
when
it
is
a
wrong
appropriation
of
public
money
no
this
would
have
been
some
faint
approach
perhaps
to
justice
some
right
in
wrong
that
would
have
closed
our
mouths
but
no
it
is
given
to
a
young
gentleman
as
i
have
said
who
has
appeared
more
than
once
in
the
with
your
victorious
eleven
who
is
fresh
from
oxford
and
would
no
more
condescend
to
consider
himself
on
a
footing
of
equality
with
the
humble
person
who
addresses
you
than
i
would
having
the
use
of
my
hands
accept
a
disgraceful
sinecure
yes
my
friends
this
is
what
the
state
church
does
she
so
cows
the
spirit
and
weakens
the
hearts
of
her
followers
that
a
young
man
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
career
able
to
teach
able
to
work
able
to
dig
educated
and
trained
and
cultured
can
stoop
to
accept
a
good
income
in
such
a
position
as
this
think
of
it
six
old
men
able
surely
if
they
are
good
for
anything
to
mumble
their
prayers
for
themselves
somehow
yet
provided
with
an
oxford
scholar
an
young
man
to
read
the
service
for
them
daily
he
thinks
it
very
fine
no
doubt
a
good
income
and
a
good
house
for
life
and
nothing
to
do
but
to
canter
over
morning
and
evening
prayer
at
a
swinging
pace
as
we
have
all
heard
it
done
morning
prayer
let
us
see
half
an
hour
or
you
may
throw
in
ten
minutes
in
case
the
six
should
mumble
their
amens
slowly
and
twenty
minutes
for
the
evening
one
hour
a
day
here
it
is
under
your
very
eyes
people
of
carlingford
a
charming
provision
for
the
son
of
one
of
your
most
respected
clergymen
why
it
is
in
your
newspaper
where
i
read
it
can
i
give
a
more
forcible
instance
of
the
way
in
which
a
state
church
cuts
honesty
and
honour
out
of
men
hearts
a
great
many
people
noticed
that
when
northcote
ended
this
with
a
thundering
voice
some
one
who
had
been
listening
near
the
door
in
an
inverness
cape
and
hat
over
his
brows
gave
himself
a
sudden
impetuous
shake
which
shook
the
crowd
and
turning
round
made
his
way
out
not
caring
whom
he
stumbled
against
the
whole
assembly
was
in
a
hubbub
when
the
orator
ceased
and
whispers
ran
freely
round
among
all
the
groups
in
the
front
that
young
may
he
means
in
course
it
young
may
infernal
job
as
i
always
said
oh
hush
pigeon
do
swear
but
it
do
seem
a
black
burning
shame
do
it
bravo
mr
called
out
old
tozer
on
the
platform
that
what
i
call
giving
forth
no
uncertain
sound
that
laying
it
into
them
and
this
was
the
climax
of
the
meeting
everything
else
was
flat
after
such
a
decided
appeal
to
personal
knowledge
phoebe
alone
gave
a
frigid
reception
to
the
hero
of
the
evening
i
dislike
personalities
she
said
pointedly
they
never
do
a
cause
any
good
and
it
is
gentlemanly
do
you
think
so
sloely
and
she
turned
away
from
northcote
who
had
come
to
speak
to
her
and
devoted
herself
to
the
man
at
her
elbow
whom
she
had
snubbed
a
little
while
before
northcote
said
to
himself
that
this
was
untrue
and
brought
up
a
hundred
very
good
reasons
why
he
should
have
employed
such
an
example
but
the
reproof
stung
him
to
the
quick
for
to
be
ungentlemanly
was
the
reproach
of
all
others
most
calculated
to
go
to
his
heart
but
nobody
knew
how
may
went
home
in
his
inverness
cape
breathing
fire
and
flame
nor
of
the
execution
he
did
thereupon
chapter
xviii
may
affairs
may
went
into
his
study
and
closed
the
door
he
poked
the
fire
he
put
himself
into
his
he
drew
his
towards
him
and
opened
it
at
where
a
sheet
lay
waiting
and
then
he
paused
rubbed
his
hands
softly
together
and
falling
back
again
laughed
quietly
to
himself
yes
he
who
had
stormed
out
of
the
like
a
whirlwind
having
discomfited
everybody
leaving
the
girls
in
tears
and
the
boys
in
a
white
heat
of
passion
when
he
reached
the
profoundest
depths
of
his
own
retirement
laughed
what
did
it
mean
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
his
children
would
have
been
most
entirely
thunderstruck
by
this
they
could
not
have
understood
it
they
were
acquainted
with
his
passions
and
with
his
moments
of
good
temper
they
knew
when
he
was
amiable
and
when
he
was
angry
by
instinct
by
the
gleam
of
his
eye
by
the
way
in
which
he
shut
the
door
but
this
was
something
totally
unknown
to
them
the
truth
was
that
may
like
many
other
people
having
a
naturally
bad
temper
which
he
indulged
freely
when
he
pleased
had
attained
the
power
of
using
it
when
it
suited
him
to
use
it
without
being
suspected
by
anybody
a
bad
temper
is
a
possession
like
another
and
may
be
made
skilful
use
of
like
other
things
which
perhaps
in
themselves
are
not
desirable
he
could
work
himself
up
into
fury
and
launch
the
doom
he
felt
disposed
to
launch
like
a
burning
and
fizzing
from
a
hand
which
was
in
reality
not
at
all
excited
and
like
most
other
people
who
possess
such
an
unrevealed
power
it
pleased
him
very
much
when
he
persuaded
his
surroundings
that
it
was
an
impulse
of
rage
which
moved
him
he
had
been
at
the
meeting
at
the
music
hall
to
hear
what
those
fellows
had
to
say
for
themselves
contempt
unbounded
but
wrathful
was
the
feeling
in
his
mind
towards
those
fellows
but
he
felt
that
young
northcote
eloquence
reported
in
next
day
papers
was
quite
enough
to
quash
for
ever
all
hopes
of
his
son
acceptance
of
the
chaplaincy
so
he
walked
home
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
and
burst
into
his
house
as
we
have
seen
with
a
semblance
of
passion
so
perfect
as
to
deceive
his
entire
family
and
fill
the
place
with
anger
and
tears
upon
which
withdrawing
from
the
scene
of
conflict
he
threw
himself
down
in
his
and
chuckled
recovering
his
composure
by
slow
degrees
when
however
this
private
indulgence
was
over
may
face
grew
dark
enough
he
pushed
his
writing
away
from
him
and
pulling
out
a
drawer
in
his
which
was
full
of
papers
of
a
very
unliterary
aspect
betook
himself
to
the
consideration
of
them
with
anything
but
laughter
in
his
looks
or
in
his
mind
letters
upon
blue
paper
in
straight
up
and
down
handwriting
other
papers
also
blue
with
ruled
lines
and
numerals
for
which
may
was
more
frightened
than
he
would
have
been
for
a
charge
of
cavalry
these
were
the
very
unattractive
contents
of
this
drawer
he
brought
two
or
three
of
them
out
in
a
bundle
and
read
them
over
one
after
another
with
contracted
brows
debt
is
an
idiosyncrasy
like
other
things
some
people
keep
clear
of
it
miraculously
some
seem
to
drop
into
it
without
cause
or
meaning
and
to
spend
all
their
lives
afterwards
in
vain
attempts
to
get
out
may
was
one
of
these
unfortunate
men
he
could
not
tell
himself
where
his
money
went
to
poor
man
it
was
not
so
much
he
had
and
there
was
a
large
family
to
be
fed
and
clothed
and
schooled
after
a
sort
but
still
other
people
on
incomes
as
small
as
his
had
managed
to
maintain
their
families
without
dropping
into
this
hopeless
condition
he
had
been
in
debt
since
ever
he
could
remember
and
to
be
sure
it
was
not
the
pain
and
trouble
to
him
that
it
is
to
many
people
so
long
as
by
hook
or
by
crook
he
could
manage
to
stave
off
the
evil
day
so
long
was
he
happy
enough
and
he
had
managed
this
by
all
sorts
of
windfalls
up
to
the
present
time
james
remittances
had
been
like
heavenly
dew
to
him
it
is
true
that
these
remittances
had
been
intended
to
keep
reginald
at
oxford
and
perhaps
something
of
the
special
hardness
with
which
he
regarded
reginald
arose
from
the
fact
that
he
had
done
him
wrong
in
this
respect
and
had
appropriated
what
was
intended
for
him
but
after
all
he
had
said
to
himself
the
maintenance
of
the
house
in
comfort
the
keeping
clean
of
the
family
name
and
the
staving
off
disagreeable
revelations
of
the
family
poverty
were
more
for
even
reginald
comfort
than
a
little
more
money
in
his
pocket
which
everybody
knew
was
very
dangerous
for
a
young
man
may
had
always
a
bill
coming
due
which
james
remittances
arrived
just
in
time
to
meet
indeed
this
was
the
normal
condition
of
his
life
he
had
always
a
bill
coming
due
a
bill
which
some
banker
had
to
be
coaxed
into
renewing
or
which
was
paid
at
the
last
moment
by
some
skilful
legerdemain
in
the
way
of
pouring
out
of
one
vessel
into
another
transferring
the
debt
from
one
quarter
to
another
so
that
there
may
have
been
said
to
be
always
a
certain
amount
of
quite
fictitious
and
visionary
money
floating
about
may
money
which
existed
only
in
the
shape
of
symbol
and
which
indeed
belonged
to
nobody
which
was
borrowed
here
and
paid
there
to
be
and
repaid
in
the
same
way
never
really
reaching
pocket
or
representing
anything
but
that
one
thing
which
money
is
supposed
to
be
able
to
extinguish
debt
when
human
affairs
reach
this
very
delicate
point
and
there
is
nothing
at
any
moment
except
a
windfall
to
keep
a
man
going
the
crisis
is
very
serious
and
it
was
no
wonder
that
may
was
anxious
to
drive
his
son
into
accepting
any
possible
appointment
and
that
he
occasionally
railed
unreasonably
at
his
family
unless
a
hundred
pounds
or
so
fell
down
from
the
skies
within
the
next
ten
days
he
saw
nothing
before
him
but
ruin
this
it
is
needless
to
say
is
very
far
from
being
a
comfortable
position
the
agitation
excitement
feverish
hope
and
fear
of
the
sufferer
might
well
affect
his
temper
if
he
could
not
get
a
hundred
pounds
within
ten
days
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
to
do
and
nobody
could
say
he
thought
to
himself
that
he
was
an
expensive
man
he
had
no
expensive
habits
he
liked
good
living
it
is
true
and
a
glass
of
good
wine
but
this
amount
of
regard
for
the
table
does
not
ruin
men
he
liked
books
also
but
he
did
not
buy
them
contenting
himself
with
such
as
the
library
could
afford
and
those
which
he
could
obtain
by
the
reviews
he
wrote
for
the
church
magazines
how
then
was
it
that
he
never
could
get
rid
of
that
rapidly
maturing
bill
he
could
not
tell
keeping
out
of
debt
is
one
thing
and
getting
rid
of
it
when
you
have
once
taken
its
yoke
upon
your
neck
is
another
his
money
when
he
had
any
slipped
through
his
fingers
as
people
say
when
remittance
or
any
other
piece
of
good
fortune
gave
him
enough
to
pay
that
hundred
pounds
without
borrowing
elsewhere
he
borrowed
elsewhere
all
the
same
it
was
a
mysterious
fatality
from
which
he
seemed
unable
to
escape
in
such
circumstances
a
crisis
must
come
sooner
or
later
and
it
appeared
to
him
that
now
at
least
after
many
hairbreadth
escapes
the
crisis
had
come
what
was
he
to
do
there
was
no
chance
alas
of
money
from
james
and
even
if
reginald
accepted
the
chaplaincy
and
was
willing
at
once
to
come
to
his
father
aid
there
was
no
hope
that
he
would
have
anything
for
some
time
for
chaplains
incomes
are
not
any
more
than
other
people
generally
paid
in
advance
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
went
over
again
for
the
hundredth
time
the
list
of
all
the
people
he
could
borrow
from
or
who
would
back
a
bill
for
him
and
he
was
still
employed
in
this
melancholy
and
hopeless
enumeration
when
a
low
knock
came
to
the
door
and
a
pushing
it
open
thrust
in
a
homely
little
man
in
a
coat
who
put
up
a
hand
to
his
forehead
as
he
came
in
with
a
salutation
which
was
half
charity
half
awkward
recruit
beyond
this
there
was
no
ceremony
about
his
entrance
no
leave
asked
or
question
made
betsy
knew
very
well
that
he
was
to
come
in
when
he
pleased
and
that
her
master
did
not
deny
himself
to
cotsdean
may
received
him
with
a
familiar
nod
and
pointed
hastily
to
a
chair
he
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
put
away
those
blue
papers
which
he
would
have
done
if
any
other
individual
even
if
one
of
his
children
had
come
into
the
room
good
evening
cotsdean
he
said
in
a
friendly
tone
well
what
news
nothing
as
is
pleasant
sir
said
the
man
sitting
down
on
a
corner
of
his
chair
i
been
to
the
bank
and
it
no
use
my
explaining
or
begging
ever
so
hard
they
wo
hear
of
it
done
it
times
and
times
they
says
to
me
we
wo
do
it
no
more
that
flat
and
so
indeed
it
is
flat
sir
as
you
may
say
downright
dunstable
but
that
ai
no
advantage
to
you
and
me
yes
it
is
cotsdean
said
the
clergyman
it
is
a
decided
advantage
for
it
shows
there
is
nothing
to
be
hoped
from
that
quarter
and
that
is
always
good
even
though
it
bad
bad
as
bad
as
can
be
you
may
say
so
sir
said
cotsdean
i
do
know
what
to
be
done
no
more
than
the
babe
unborn
and
it
wearing
me
to
death
that
what
it
doing
when
i
looks
round
on
my
small
family
it
all
i
can
do
not
to
cry
out
loud
what
to
become
of
my
children
may
yours
sir
they
never
want
friends
and
a
hundred
or
so
here
or
there
that
do
ruin
gentlefolks
but
without
selling
up
the
business
how
am
i
ever
to
get
a
hundred
pounds
it
ai
equal
sir
i
swear
it
ai
you
gets
the
money
and
you
takes
it
easy
and
do
hold
your
head
not
a
bit
lower
but
me
as
has
no
good
of
it
except
in
the
way
o
a
bit
of
custom
that
is
a
deal
more
in
looks
than
anything
else
and
has
to
go
round
to
all
the
folks
to
brownlow
at
the
bank
and
i
do
know
who
as
if
it
was
for
me
i
suffers
in
my
credit
sir
and
i
suffers
in
my
spirits
and
i
suffers
in
my
health
and
when
the
smash
comes
what
to
become
of
my
poor
children
it
enough
to
put
a
man
beside
himself
that
what
it
is
here
the
poor
man
eyes
grew
bloodshot
partly
with
rubbing
them
partly
with
tears
he
rubbed
them
with
the
sleeve
of
his
rough
coat
and
the
tears
were
very
real
though
few
in
number
cotsdean
despair
was
indeed
tragical
enough
but
its
outside
had
in
it
a
dash
of
comedy
which
though
he
was
in
no
mirthful
mood
caught
the
quick
eye
of
may
he
was
himself
very
painfully
affected
to
tell
the
truth
but
yet
it
cost
him
an
effort
not
to
smile
cotsdean
he
said
have
i
ever
failed
you
yet
you
have
done
a
good
deal
for
me
i
do
deny
it
you
have
had
all
the
trouble
but
beyond
that
what
have
you
suffered
except
in
imagination
if
you
choose
to
exaggerate
dangers
it
is
not
my
fault
your
children
are
as
safe
as
as
safe
as
the
bank
of
england
now
have
i
ever
failed
you
answer
me
that
i
ca
say
as
you
have
sir
said
cotsdean
but
it
dreadful
work
playing
with
a
man
ruin
off
and
on
like
this
and
nobody
knowing
what
might
happen
or
what
a
day
or
an
hour
might
bring
forth
that
is
very
true
said
may
i
might
die
that
is
what
you
mean
very
true
though
not
quite
so
kind
as
i
might
have
expected
from
an
old
friend
a
very
old
friend
i
am
sure
sir
i
beg
your
pardon
cried
the
poor
man
it
that
but
only
just
as
i
driven
out
o
my
seven
senses
with
thinking
and
thinking
my
dear
cotsdean
do
think
there
could
not
be
a
more
unnecessary
exercise
what
good
does
your
thinking
do
but
to
make
you
unhappy
leave
that
to
me
we
have
been
driven
into
a
corner
before
now
but
nothing
has
ever
happened
to
us
you
will
see
something
will
turn
up
this
time
i
ask
you
again
have
i
ever
failed
you
you
know
best
no
sir
said
cotsdean
somewhat
doubtfully
no
i
did
say
as
you
had
it
only
i
suppose
i
ai
so
young
as
i
once
was
and
a
feelin
sir
ai
always
in
his
own
control
you
must
take
care
that
it
is
only
to
me
that
you
make
such
an
exhibition
as
this
said
may
who
is
there
oh
my
coffee
put
it
on
the
table
if
you
are
seen
coming
here
to
me
with
red
eyes
and
this
agitated
appearance
he
went
on
waiting
pointedly
till
the
door
was
closed
it
will
be
supposed
there
is
some
family
reason
for
it
again
oh
lor
sir
you
know
yes
i
know
very
well
said
the
clergyman
i
know
that
there
be
a
better
wife
and
that
bygones
are
bygones
but
you
must
remember
and
take
care
everybody
does
know
you
and
her
so
well
as
i
do
when
you
come
to
see
your
clergyman
in
this
agitated
state
i
put
it
to
yourself
cotsdean
i
put
it
to
your
good
sense
what
is
anybody
to
think
you
must
take
great
care
not
to
betray
yourself
to
anybody
but
me
the
man
looked
at
him
with
a
of
consternation
bewildered
by
the
very
boldness
with
which
he
was
thus
set
down
betray
himself
he
drew
a
long
breath
as
if
he
had
received
a
of
cold
water
in
his
face
which
was
indeed
very
much
like
the
effect
that
this
extraordinary
address
produced
betray
himself
poor
struggles
and
sufferings
arose
at
the
present
moment
entirely
from
the
fact
that
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
made
use
of
for
occasions
and
both
the
men
were
perfectly
aware
of
this
but
though
he
gasped
cotsdean
was
too
much
under
the
influence
of
his
clergyman
to
do
anything
more
had
he
been
a
dissenter
he
would
have
patronized
young
northcote
who
was
as
good
a
man
as
may
or
far
better
if
truth
were
told
with
the
frankest
certainty
of
his
own
superior
position
but
being
a
humble
churchman
he
yielded
to
his
clergyman
as
to
one
of
the
powers
that
be
it
is
a
curious
difference
he
sat
still
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
while
may
walked
across
the
room
to
the
table
by
the
door
where
his
had
been
placed
and
took
his
cup
and
drank
it
he
was
not
civil
enough
to
ask
his
visitor
to
share
it
indeed
it
never
would
have
occurred
to
him
though
he
did
not
hesitate
to
use
poor
cotsdean
for
his
own
purpose
to
treat
him
otherwise
than
as
men
treat
their
servants
and
inferiors
when
he
had
finished
his
coffee
he
went
leisurely
back
into
his
former
place
you
have
nothing
to
suggest
he
said
nothing
to
advise
well
i
must
try
what
i
can
do
it
will
be
hard
work
but
still
i
must
do
it
you
know
added
may
in
a
gracious
tone
i
have
never
concealed
from
you
cotsdean
how
much
i
appreciated
your
assistance
everything
of
this
sort
is
so
much
worse
in
my
position
than
in
yours
you
understand
that
a
gentleman
and
a
clergyman
has
things
expected
from
him
which
never
would
be
thought
of
in
your
case
i
have
never
omitted
to
acknowledge
my
obligations
to
you
and
you
also
owe
some
obligations
to
me
i
do
deny
as
you
been
very
kind
sir
said
cotsdean
then
he
wavered
a
little
i
never
denied
it
and
me
could
never
have
it
off
but
for
you
i
do
forget
a
favour
nobody
can
say
that
of
me
i
ai
forgot
it
in
this
case
i
do
say
that
you
have
forgotten
it
i
have
always
put
the
utmost
confidence
in
you
but
my
good
fellow
you
must
not
come
to
me
in
this
way
have
i
ever
failed
you
we
been
hard
pressed
enough
at
times
but
something
has
always
turned
up
have
not
i
told
you
a
hundred
times
providence
will
provide
if
you
put
it
like
that
sir
i
do
put
it
like
that
i
have
always
been
helped
you
know
sometimes
when
it
seemed
the
last
moment
leave
it
to
me
i
have
no
more
doubt
said
may
lifting
up
a
countenance
which
was
by
no
means
so
untroubled
as
could
have
been
wished
that
when
the
time
comes
all
will
be
well
than
i
have
of
the
sun
rising
which
it
will
he
added
with
some
solemnity
whether
you
and
i
live
to
see
it
or
not
leave
it
all
i
say
to
me
cotsdean
did
not
make
any
reply
he
was
overawed
by
this
solemnity
of
tone
and
knew
his
place
too
well
to
set
himself
up
against
his
clergyman
but
still
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
decision
was
less
satisfactory
than
one
of
much
less
exalted
tone
might
have
been
he
had
not
the
courage
to
say
anything
he
withdrew
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
a
cloud
over
his
face
but
as
he
left
the
house
the
doubt
in
his
soul
breathed
itself
forth
if
so
be
as
neither
me
nor
him
see
it
rise
what
good
will
that
do
to
my
family
said
cotsdean
to
himself
and
went
his
way
to
his
closed
shop
through
all
the
sacks
of
seeds
and
dry
rustling
grain
with
a
heavy
heart
he
was
a
in
a
tolerable
business
which
as
most
of
the
bankers
of
carlingford
knew
he
had
some
difficulty
in
carrying
along
being
generally
in
want
of
money
but
this
was
not
so
rare
a
circumstance
that
any
special
notice
should
be
taken
of
it
everybody
who
knew
thought
it
was
very
kind
of
may
to
back
him
up
as
he
did
and
even
to
put
his
name
to
bills
for
poor
cotsdean
to
whom
indeed
he
was
known
to
have
been
very
kind
in
many
ways
but
nobody
was
aware
how
little
of
these
said
bills
went
to
cotsdean
and
how
much
to
may
when
he
was
gone
the
clergyman
threw
himself
back
again
into
his
chair
with
a
pale
face
providence
which
he
treated
like
some
sort
of
neutral
deity
and
was
so
very
sure
of
having
on
his
side
when
he
spoke
to
cotsdean
did
not
feel
so
near
to
him
or
so
much
under
his
command
when
cotsdean
was
gone
there
were
still
two
days
but
if
before
that
he
could
not
make
some
provision
what
was
to
be
done
he
was
not
a
cruel
or
bad
man
and
would
have
suffered
keenly
had
anything
happened
to
poor
cotsdean
and
his
family
on
his
account
but
they
must
be
sacrificed
if
it
came
to
that
and
the
thought
was
very
appalling
what
was
he
to
do
his
friends
were
exhausted
and
so
were
his
expedients
there
was
no
longer
any
one
he
could
borrow
from
or
who
would
take
even
a
share
of
his
burden
on
their
shoulders
what
was
he
to
do
chapter
xix
the
new
chaplain
it
can
not
be
denied
that
reluctant
as
reginald
may
had
been
to
accept
the
chaplaincy
of
which
so
much
had
been
said
he
had
no
sooner
fairly
done
so
and
committed
himself
beyond
remedy
than
a
certain
sense
of
relief
began
to
steal
over
the
young
man
mind
he
had
made
the
leap
moved
at
last
by
arguments
which
perhaps
were
not
worth
very
much
logically
and
which
even
while
he
yielded
to
them
he
saw
the
weakness
of
he
felt
sure
that
when
he
woke
in
the
morning
and
realized
what
he
had
done
fearful
feelings
of
remorse
would
seize
him
but
curiously
enough
this
was
not
so
and
his
first
sensation
was
relief
that
the
conflict
was
over
and
that
he
had
no
more
angry
remonstrances
to
meet
with
or
soft
pleadings
from
ursula
or
assaults
of
rude
abruptness
from
janey
all
that
was
over
and
then
a
warm
glow
of
independence
and
competency
came
over
the
young
man
you
may
be
sure
he
had
no
fire
in
his
rooms
to
make
him
warm
and
it
was
a
chill
january
morning
with
snow
in
the
heavy
sky
and
fog
in
the
yellow
air
but
notwithstanding
there
came
a
glow
of
comfort
over
him
independent
free
to
go
where
he
pleased
buy
what
he
liked
spend
his
time
as
best
seemed
to
him
with
a
position
of
his
own
even
a
house
of
his
own
he
laughed
softly
to
himself
at
this
new
idea
it
did
not
somehow
hurt
him
as
he
thought
it
would
this
sinecure
he
had
accepted
could
he
not
make
it
up
as
ursula
said
work
for
the
town
in
other
ways
without
pay
since
the
town
had
given
him
pay
without
work
a
genial
feeling
of
toleration
came
over
reginald
mind
why
should
he
have
made
such
a
fuss
about
it
it
was
natural
that
his
father
should
insist
and
now
that
it
was
done
he
himself
did
not
wish
it
undone
as
he
had
expected
to
do
after
all
if
you
judged
matters
with
such
rigidity
who
was
there
without
guilt
what
public
appointment
was
given
and
held
according
to
abstract
right
as
formally
speaking
it
ought
to
be
those
in
the
highest
offices
were
appointed
not
because
of
their
personal
excellence
but
because
of
being
some
other
man
son
or
brother
and
yet
on
the
whole
public
duty
was
well
done
and
the
unjust
ruler
and
hireling
priest
were
exceptions
even
men
whose
entry
into
the
fold
was
very
precipitate
over
the
wall
violently
or
by
some
of
private
interest
made
very
good
shepherds
once
they
were
inside
nothing
was
perfect
in
this
world
and
yet
things
were
more
good
than
evil
and
if
he
himself
made
it
his
study
to
create
for
himself
an
ideal
position
to
become
a
doer
of
all
kinds
of
volunteer
work
what
would
it
matter
that
his
appointment
was
not
an
ideal
appointment
it
seemed
very
strange
to
him
and
almost
like
an
interposition
of
providence
in
his
favour
that
he
should
feel
in
this
way
for
reginald
was
not
aware
that
such
revulsions
of
feeling
were
very
natural
phenomena
and
that
the
sensation
after
any
great
decision
is
almost
invariably
one
of
relief
to
be
sure
it
upset
this
manly
state
of
mind
a
little
when
coming
down
to
breakfast
his
father
gave
him
a
nod
and
said
briefly
i
am
glad
you
have
seen
your
duty
at
last
this
made
him
almost
resolve
to
throw
it
up
again
but
the
feeling
was
momentary
why
should
he
give
it
up
it
had
made
him
independent
already
he
thought
of
his
independence
as
a
thing
accomplished
and
he
would
make
full
amends
to
the
church
and
to
carlingford
for
taking
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
without
working
for
it
surely
he
could
do
that
he
did
not
grudge
work
but
rather
liked
it
and
would
be
ready
to
do
anything
he
did
not
care
what
to
make
his
sinecure
into
a
volunteer
outpost
for
every
good
work
yes
that
was
the
way
to
look
at
it
and
it
was
a
glorious
independence
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
and
the
house
cried
ursula
when
may
had
left
the
and
left
them
free
to
chatter
the
house
i
think
you
are
likely
to
find
a
tenant
for
it
the
houses
in
grange
lane
are
so
cheap
now
and
some
people
object
to
the
poor
old
men
i
think
you
must
keep
the
house
furnishing
will
be
an
expense
but
of
course
when
you
have
a
certain
income
that
makes
such
a
difference
and
you
can
come
and
see
us
every
day
why
ca
he
live
at
home
said
janey
we
are
so
poor
he
ought
to
come
and
pay
us
something
for
his
board
and
help
us
to
get
on
what
can
you
know
about
it
at
your
age
said
ursula
we
have
not
got
proper
rooms
for
reginald
he
ought
at
least
to
have
a
study
of
his
own
as
well
as
a
now
that
he
has
an
appointment
no
you
must
go
to
the
college
reginald
and
perhaps
you
might
have
one
of
the
boys
with
you
say
johnnie
which
would
be
a
great
saving
for
he
has
an
appetite
he
eats
more
than
two
of
the
rest
of
us
do
you
might
take
one
of
them
with
you
to
save
the
bills
a
little
if
you
like
take
me
said
janey
i
have
a
good
appetite
too
and
then
i
a
girl
which
is
a
great
deal
more
useful
i
could
keep
your
house
oh
reginald
may
we
go
out
and
see
it
i
want
to
see
it
i
have
never
once
been
over
the
college
not
in
all
my
life
we
might
as
well
go
do
you
think
ursula
he
said
appealing
to
her
with
a
delightful
mixture
of
helplessness
and
supremacy
yesterday
he
had
not
been
able
to
assert
any
exclusive
claim
to
sixpence
now
he
had
a
house
a
house
all
his
own
it
pleased
him
to
think
of
taking
the
girls
to
it
and
as
for
having
one
of
them
he
was
ready
to
have
them
all
to
live
with
him
ursula
thought
fit
to
accede
graciously
to
this
suggestion
when
she
had
looked
after
her
numerous
household
duties
janey
in
the
mean
time
had
been
practising
in
one
of
her
periodical
fits
of
diligence
for
you
know
if
reginald
did
really
want
me
to
keep
house
for
him
said
janey
you
have
too
much
to
do
at
home
or
of
course
he
would
like
you
best
it
would
be
dreadful
if
people
found
out
how
little
i
know
you
ought
to
go
to
school
said
ursula
gravely
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
for
a
girl
never
to
have
had
any
education
perhaps
reggie
might
spare
a
little
money
to
send
you
to
school
or
perhaps
papa
school
yourself
retorted
janey
indignant
but
then
she
thought
better
of
it
perhaps
just
for
a
year
to
finish
she
added
in
a
doubtful
tone
they
thought
reginald
could
do
anything
on
that
wonderful
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
the
college
was
a
picturesque
old
building
at
the
other
side
of
carlingford
standing
in
pretty
grounds
with
some
fine
trees
under
which
the
old
men
sat
and
amused
themselves
in
the
summer
mornings
on
this
chilly
wintry
day
none
of
them
were
visible
except
the
cheerful
old
soul
bent
almost
double
but
with
a
chirruppy
little
voice
like
a
superannuated
sparrow
who
acted
as
porter
and
closed
the
big
gates
every
night
and
fined
the
old
men
twopence
if
they
were
too
late
he
trotted
along
the
echoing
passages
with
his
keys
jingling
to
show
them
the
chaplain
rooms
the
old
gentlemen
is
all
as
pleased
as
punch
said
joe
we
was
a
feared
as
it
might
be
somebody
foreign
not
a
carlingford
gentleman
and
some
parsons
is
queer
saving
your
presence
may
but
we
knows
where
you
comes
from
and
all
about
you
as
one
of
the
old
gentlemen
was
just
to
me
furnished
miss
lord
bless
you
yes
they
furnished
it
all
furnished
is
college
you
think
as
the
things
look
a
bit
queer
they
was
made
not
this
year
nor
yet
last
year
i
can
tell
you
and
they
ai
in
the
fashion
but
if
so
be
as
you
do
stand
by
fashion
there
they
is
said
joe
throwing
open
the
door
the
young
people
went
in
softly
their
excitement
subdued
into
a
kind
of
awe
an
empty
house
furnished
is
more
desolate
more
overwhelming
to
the
imagination
than
a
house
which
is
bare
for
whom
was
it
waiting
all
ready
there
swept
and
garnished
or
were
there
already
unseen
inhabitants
about
writing
ghostly
letters
on
the
tables
seated
on
the
chairs
even
janey
was
hushed
i
rather
stay
at
home
after
all
she
whispered
in
ursula
ear
under
her
breath
but
after
awhile
they
became
familiar
with
the
silent
place
and
awoke
the
echoes
in
it
with
their
voices
and
new
life
nothing
so
young
had
been
in
the
college
for
years
the
last
chaplain
had
been
an
old
man
and
an
old
bachelor
and
the
pensioners
were
all
solitary
living
a
sort
of
monastic
life
each
in
his
room
like
workers
in
their
cells
when
janey
surprised
by
some
unexpected
joke
burst
into
one
of
her
peals
of
laughter
the
old
building
echoed
all
through
it
and
more
than
one
window
was
put
up
and
head
projected
to
know
the
cause
of
this
profanation
joe
cried
one
portentous
voice
what
happened
what
the
meaning
of
this
it
only
them
sir
said
joe
delighting
in
the
vagueness
of
his
rejoinder
they
ai
used
to
it
that
the
truth
but
laugh
away
miss
it
do
you
good
he
added
benignly
joe
was
of
a
cheerful
spirit
notwithstanding
his
infirmities
and
he
foresaw
lightsome
days
somewhat
taken
aback
however
by
the
commotion
produced
by
laugh
the
young
party
left
the
college
ursula
carrying
with
her
sundry
memoranda
and
measurements
for
curtains
and
carpets
you
must
have
curtains
she
said
and
i
think
a
carpet
for
the
study
the
other
room
will
do
but
the
study
is
cold
it
has
not
the
sunshine
i
wonder
if
we
might
go
and
look
at
some
all
at
once
here
the
three
paused
in
the
road
and
looked
at
each
other
somewhat
overcome
by
the
grandeur
of
the
idea
even
reginald
notwithstanding
his
oxford
experience
held
his
breath
a
little
at
the
thought
of
going
right
off
without
further
consideration
and
buying
carpets
and
curtains
as
for
janey
she
laughed
again
in
pure
excitement
and
delight
fancy
going
into
holden
walking
right
in
as
if
we
had
the
bank
in
our
pockets
and
ordering
whatever
we
like
she
cried
i
suppose
we
must
have
them
said
reginald
yielding
slowly
to
the
pleasure
of
acquisition
ursula
was
transformed
by
the
instinct
of
business
and
management
into
the
leader
of
the
party
of
course
you
must
have
them
she
said
with
the
air
of
a
woman
who
had
ordered
curtains
all
her
life
otherwise
you
will
catch
cold
and
that
is
not
desirable
and
she
marched
calmly
towards
holden
while
janey
dropped
behind
to
smother
the
laughter
which
expressed
her
amazed
delight
in
this
new
situation
it
is
doubtful
whether
holden
would
have
given
them
so
good
a
reception
had
the
miss
mays
gone
to
hint
to
order
curtains
for
the
parsonage
for
the
carlingford
tradesmen
were
very
well
aware
of
the
difficulties
in
point
of
payment
which
attended
purchases
but
holden
was
all
smiles
at
the
idea
of
fitting
up
the
rooms
in
the
college
carpets
i
have
a
turkey
carpet
that
would
just
suit
one
of
those
old
rooms
rooms
are
so
much
thought
of
at
present
said
the
man
of
furniture
yes
i
suppose
that
would
do
said
reginald
with
a
side
look
at
his
sister
to
know
if
he
was
right
ursula
slew
him
with
a
glance
of
her
brown
eyes
she
was
almost
grand
in
superior
knowledge
and
righteous
indignation
turkey
are
you
out
of
your
senses
do
you
think
we
have
the
bank
in
our
pockets
she
whispered
to
him
angrily
as
janey
says
how
was
i
to
know
he
said
so
said
the
alarmed
chaplain
cowed
notwithstanding
his
income
said
so
that
is
just
like
you
boys
taking
whatever
everyone
tells
you
why
a
turkey
carpet
costs
a
fortune
holden
i
think
if
you
please
brussels
will
do
or
some
of
those
new
kinds
a
jumble
of
colours
without
any
decided
pattern
not
too
expensive
said
ursula
solemnly
the
colour
mounting
to
her
face
they
were
all
rather
brought
down
from
their
first
delight
and
grandeur
when
this
was
said
for
stipulating
about
expense
made
a
difference
all
at
once
the
delightful
sensation
of
marching
into
holden
as
if
the
world
belonged
to
them
was
over
but
janey
was
touched
to
see
that
holden
still
remained
civil
and
did
not
express
in
his
countenance
the
contempt
he
must
have
felt
when
this
was
over
and
holden
had
kindly
suggested
the
idea
of
sending
various
stuffs
to
the
college
that
they
might
judge
of
the
effect
the
party
went
home
slightly
subdued
the
air
was
heavy
and
yellow
and
prophesied
snow
but
a
very
red
wintry
sun
had
managed
to
make
an
opening
temporarily
in
the
clouds
and
threw
a
ruddy
ray
down
grange
lane
bringing
out
the
few
passengers
who
were
coming
and
going
under
the
old
garden
walls
ursula
clasped
her
hands
together
and
came
to
a
stop
suddenly
when
she
turned
her
eyes
that
way
oh
she
said
here
she
is
she
is
coming
all
by
herself
and
we
ca
help
meeting
her
the
young
lady
in
black
shall
we
speak
to
her
said
janey
with
a
little
awe
who
is
the
young
lady
in
black
said
reginald
this
girl
who
is
coming
up
i
never
saw
her
before
in
carlingford
is
she
some
one
you
have
met
with
the
dorsets
she
do
look
much
like
grange
lane
oh
hush
here
she
is
said
ursula
losing
all
that
importance
of
aspect
which
her
position
as
leader
of
the
expedition
had
given
her
a
pretty
blush
of
expectation
came
over
her
face
her
dimples
revealed
themselves
as
if
by
magic
you
will
think
it
strange
perhaps
that
the
sight
of
one
girl
should
produce
this
effect
upon
another
but
then
phoebe
represented
to
ursula
the
only
glimpse
she
had
ever
had
into
a
world
which
looked
gay
and
splendid
to
the
country
girl
a
world
in
which
phoebe
had
appeared
to
her
as
a
princess
reigning
in
glory
and
delight
ursula
forgot
both
her
companions
and
her
recent
occupation
would
the
young
lady
in
black
notice
her
stop
perhaps
and
talk
to
her
remember
her
her
eyes
began
to
glow
and
dance
with
excitement
she
stumbled
as
she
went
on
in
her
anxiety
fixing
her
eyes
upon
the
approaching
figure
phoebe
for
her
part
was
taking
a
constitutional
walk
up
and
down
grange
lane
and
she
too
was
a
little
moved
recognizing
the
girl
and
wondering
what
it
would
be
wisest
to
do
whether
to
speak
to
her
and
break
her
lonely
promenade
with
a
little
society
or
remember
her
place
and
save
herself
from
further
mortification
by
passing
the
clergyman
daughter
who
was
a
cousin
of
the
dorsets
with
a
bow
the
dorsets
would
recognise
me
nor
miss
may
either
phoebe
said
to
herself
they
but
ursula
looked
so
wistful
as
they
approached
each
other
that
she
had
not
the
courage
to
keep
to
this
wise
resolution
though
she
was
only
the
granddaughter
of
tozer
the
butterman
she
was
much
more
a
woman
of
the
world
than
this
pretty
blushing
girl
who
courted
her
notice
she
put
out
her
hand
instinctively
when
they
met
it
ca
harm
anybody
but
myself
after
all
she
thought
oh
i
am
so
glad
you
remember
me
cried
ursula
i
knew
you
in
a
moment
have
you
come
to
stay
here
this
is
my
brother
reginald
and
my
little
sister
janey
how
janey
scowled
at
that
and
with
reason
for
she
was
by
half
an
inch
the
taller
of
the
two
are
you
taking
a
walk
i
do
hope
you
like
carlingford
i
do
hope
you
are
going
to
stay
that
is
our
house
down
at
the
end
of
the
lane
close
to
roque
papa
is
the
clergyman
there
it
will
be
so
delightful
said
ursula
repeating
herself
in
her
excitement
if
you
are
going
to
stay
i
am
going
to
stay
for
some
time
said
phoebe
graciously
i
quite
know
how
long
i
came
here
shortly
after
i
saw
you
in
town
my
grandfather
lives
here
grange
lane
is
very
nice
for
a
walk
grandmamma
is
an
invalid
so
that
i
do
leave
her
very
often
it
was
great
luck
finding
you
just
as
i
had
come
out
for
it
is
not
cheerful
walking
alone
phoebe
felt
perfectly
sure
that
through
each
of
the
three
heads
turned
towards
her
a
hurried
inquiry
was
going
on
as
to
which
of
those
enclosed
houses
contained
the
grandmother
who
was
an
invalid
but
no
sort
of
enlightenment
followed
the
inquiry
and
as
for
ursula
it
terminated
abruptly
in
her
mind
with
a
rush
of
cordiality
she
was
not
at
an
age
when
friendship
pauses
to
make
any
inquiry
into
grandmothers
i
am
so
glad
for
if
you
are
not
going
anywhere
in
particular
we
may
all
walk
together
janey
knows
you
quite
well
i
have
talked
of
you
so
often
here
phoebe
gave
a
gracious
bow
and
smile
to
janey
who
was
not
quite
sure
that
she
liked
to
be
thus
patronized
and
so
does
my
brother
said
ursula
more
doubtfully
do
you
like
carlingford
have
you
seen
many
people
oh
i
do
hope
you
will
stay
i
have
not
seen
anybody
said
phoebe
my
people
are
not
much
in
society
when
one
is
old
and
sick
i
do
suppose
one
cares
there
is
no
society
to
speak
of
in
carlingford
said
reginald
it
is
like
most
other
country
towns
if
you
like
it
we
shall
be
sure
your
liking
is
quite
disinterested
for
it
has
no
social
charms
when
had
reginald
said
so
many
words
at
a
time
to
a
young
lady
before
the
girls
exchanged
glances
i
think
it
is
pretty
said
phoebe
closing
the
subject
it
is
going
to
snow
do
you
think
i
suppose
you
skate
like
all
the
young
ladies
now
it
seems
the
first
thing
any
one
thinks
of
when
the
winter
begins
do
you
skate
said
ursula
her
eyes
brighter
and
opener
than
ever
oh
a
little
as
everybody
does
perhaps
if
there
is
no
society
said
phoebe
turning
to
reginald
for
the
first
time
people
are
free
here
from
the
necessity
of
doing
as
everybody
does
i
do
think
there
is
any
such
bondage
in
the
world
dressing
living
working
amusing
yourself
you
have
to
do
everything
as
other
people
do
it
so
i
skate
i
ca
help
myself
and
a
hundred
foolish
things
beside
but
i
should
think
it
cried
ursula
i
have
always
envied
the
boys
they
look
so
warm
when
we
are
all
shivering
reginald
if
it
freezes
will
you
teach
us
i
think
i
should
like
it
better
than
anything
in
the
world
yes
said
reginald
if
miss
if
we
can
make
up
a
party
if
you
he
added
with
a
perfectly
new
inflection
in
his
voice
will
come
too
i
see
you
do
know
my
name
said
phoebe
with
a
soft
little
laugh
it
is
beecham
one
never
catches
names
at
a
party
i
remembered
yours
because
of
a
family
in
a
novel
that
i
used
to
admire
very
much
in
my
girlish
days
oh
i
know
cried
janey
the
daisy
chain
we
are
not
a
set
of
prigs
like
those
people
we
are
not
goody
whatever
we
are
we
i
do
suppose
miss
beecham
cares
for
your
opinion
of
the
family
character
said
reginald
in
a
tone
that
made
janey
furious
thus
discoursing
they
reached
the
gates
of
the
parsonage
where
ursula
was
most
eager
that
her
friend
should
come
in
and
here
may
joined
them
who
was
impressed
like
everybody
else
by
phoebe
appearance
and
made
himself
so
agreeable
that
reginald
felt
eclipsed
and
driven
into
the
background
ursula
had
never
been
so
satisfied
with
her
father
in
her
life
though
there
was
a
cloud
on
may
soul
it
suited
him
to
show
a
high
with
everybody
in
recompense
for
his
satisfactory
decision
and
he
was
indeed
in
a
state
of
high
complacence
with
himself
for
having
managed
matters
so
cleverly
that
the
very
thing
which
should
have
secured
reginald
final
abandonment
of
the
chaplaincy
determined
him
on
the
contrary
to
accept
it
and
he
admired
phoebe
and
was
dazzled
by
her
and
knowledge
of
the
world
he
supported
ursula
invitation
warmly
but
the
stranger
freed
herself
with
graceful
excuses
she
had
her
patient
to
attend
to
that
is
a
very
young
woman
said
may
when
they
had
gone
in
after
watching
regretfully
their
new
acquaintance
progress
through
grange
lane
you
met
her
in
town
did
you
a
friend
of
the
dorsets
where
is
she
living
i
wonder
and
whom
does
she
belong
to
one
does
not
often
see
that
style
of
thing
here
i
never
saw
any
one
like
her
before
said
ursula
fervently
and
they
were
still
all
uniting
in
admiration
of
phoebe
when
but
such
an
interruption
demands
another
page
chapter
xx
that
tozer
girl
well
who
is
she
cried
sam
hurst
too
curious
to
think
of
the
ordinary
decorums
she
had
no
bonnet
on
but
a
light
cloud
of
white
wool
over
her
cap
and
her
whole
aspect
was
full
of
eagerness
and
excitement
why
did
you
tell
me
you
knew
her
who
is
she
i
am
dying
to
know
who
is
who
said
ursula
rather
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
being
politely
rude
to
sam
hurst
before
papa
how
is
any
one
to
find
out
from
the
way
you
speak
she
who
is
she
that
is
just
what
i
want
you
to
tell
me
said
sam
hurst
with
imperturbable
you
may
you
are
always
good
to
me
though
ursula
has
her
little
tempers
the
girl
you
were
talking
to
at
the
door
i
stood
and
watched
from
the
window
and
i
scarcely
could
contain
myself
sufficiently
not
to
bounce
out
in
the
middle
of
the
talk
now
do
tell
as
the
americans
say
who
is
that
tozer
girl
that
tozer
girl
ursula
gave
a
little
shriek
and
grew
first
red
and
then
pale
with
horror
and
dismay
yes
i
told
you
about
her
so
well
dressed
and
looking
so
nice
that
was
she
with
the
very
same
dress
such
a
charming
dress
so
much
style
about
it
who
is
she
ursula
may
tell
me
who
is
she
you
imagine
how
much
i
want
to
know
ursula
dropped
into
a
chair
looking
like
a
little
ghost
faint
and
rigid
she
said
afterwards
to
janey
that
she
felt
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
that
it
must
be
true
she
could
have
cried
with
pain
and
disappointment
but
she
would
not
give
sam
hurst
the
pleasure
of
making
her
cry
there
must
be
some
mistake
said
reginald
interposing
this
is
a
lady
my
sister
met
her
in
town
with
the
dorsets
oh
does
she
know
the
dorsets
too
said
the
inquirer
that
makes
it
still
more
interesting
yes
that
is
the
girl
that
is
with
the
tozers
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
it
she
is
the
granddaughter
she
was
at
the
meeting
last
night
i
had
it
from
the
best
authority
on
the
platform
with
old
tozer
and
indeed
may
how
any
one
that
had
been
there
could
dare
to
look
you
in
the
face
i
was
there
myself
said
may
it
amused
me
very
much
tell
me
now
about
this
young
person
is
she
an
impostor
taking
people
in
or
what
is
it
all
about
ursula
looks
as
if
she
was
in
the
trick
herself
and
had
been
found
out
i
am
she
is
not
an
impostor
said
ursula
an
impostor
if
you
had
seen
her
as
i
saw
her
at
a
great
beautiful
splendid
ball
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
i
was
nobody
there
nobody
and
neither
were
cousin
anne
and
cousin
sophy
but
miss
beecham
it
is
a
mistake
i
suppose
the
girl
said
raising
herself
up
with
great
dignity
when
people
are
always
trying
for
news
they
get
the
wrong
news
sometimes
i
do
doubt
you
may
be
sure
it
is
a
mistake
that
me
said
sam
hurst
with
a
laugh
that
is
one
of
assaults
upon
poor
me
yes
i
confess
it
i
am
fond
of
news
and
i
never
said
she
was
an
impostor
poor
girl
i
am
dreadfully
sorry
for
her
i
think
she
is
a
good
girl
trying
to
do
her
duty
to
her
relations
she
did
choose
her
own
grandfather
i
dare
say
if
she
had
any
say
in
it
she
would
have
made
a
very
different
choice
but
whether
your
papa
may
think
her
a
proper
friend
for
you
being
tozer
granddaughter
miss
ursula
that
quite
a
different
business
i
am
bound
to
say
again
ursula
felt
herself
kept
from
crying
by
sheer
pride
and
nothing
else
she
bit
her
lips
tight
she
would
not
give
in
hurst
to
triumph
over
her
and
to
give
her
opinion
as
to
what
papa
might
think
proper
ursula
turned
her
back
upon
hurst
which
was
not
civil
fearing
every
moment
some
denunciation
from
papa
but
nothing
of
the
kind
came
he
asked
quite
quietly
after
a
while
where
did
you
meet
this
young
lady
without
any
perceptible
inflection
of
anger
in
his
tone
why
papa
cried
janey
distressed
to
be
kept
so
long
silent
everybody
knows
where
ursula
met
her
no
one
has
heard
of
anything
else
since
she
came
home
she
met
her
of
course
at
the
ball
you
know
reginald
know
the
ball
where
she
went
with
cousin
anne
never
mind
cousin
anne
i
want
the
name
of
the
people
at
whose
house
it
was
copperhead
papa
said
ursula
rousing
herself
if
cousin
anne
does
not
know
a
lady
from
a
common
person
who
does
i
wonder
it
was
cousin
anne
who
introduced
me
to
her
i
think
their
name
was
copperhead
and
they
lived
in
a
great
big
beautiful
house
in
the
street
where
ambassadors
and
quantities
of
great
people
live
i
forget
the
name
of
it
but
i
know
there
was
an
ambassador
lived
there
and
cousin
anne
said
copperhead
i
thought
so
said
may
when
ursula
has
been
set
on
the
subject
of
cousin
anne
there
is
nothing
rational
to
be
got
from
her
after
that
for
an
hour
or
two
you
take
an
interest
in
this
young
lady
he
said
shortly
turning
to
sam
hurst
who
stood
by
smiling
rather
enjoying
the
commotion
she
had
caused
who
i
i
take
an
interest
in
anybody
that
makes
a
stir
and
gives
us
something
to
talk
about
said
hurst
frankly
you
know
my
weakness
ursula
despises
me
for
it
but
you
know
human
nature
if
i
did
not
take
an
interest
in
my
neighbours
what
would
become
of
me
a
poor
lone
elderly
woman
without
either
chick
or
child
she
rounded
off
this
forlorn
description
of
herself
with
a
hearty
laugh
in
which
janey
who
had
a
secret
kindness
for
their
merry
neighbour
though
she
feared
her
for
papa
joined
furtively
may
however
did
not
enter
into
the
joke
with
the
sympathy
which
he
usually
showed
to
hurst
he
smiled
but
there
was
something
and
in
his
air
how
sorry
we
all
are
for
you
he
said
your
position
is
truly
melancholy
i
am
glad
for
your
sake
that
old
tozer
has
a
pretty
granddaughter
to
beguile
you
now
and
then
out
of
recollection
of
your
cares
there
was
a
sharp
tone
in
this
which
caught
hurst
ear
and
she
was
not
disposed
to
accept
any
sharpness
from
may
she
turned
the
tables
upon
him
promptly
what
a
disgraceful
business
that
meeting
was
of
course
you
have
seen
the
paper
there
ought
to
be
some
way
of
punishing
those
agitators
that
go
about
the
country
taking
away
people
characters
could
not
you
bring
him
up
for
libel
or
reginald
i
never
knew
anything
so
shocking
to
come
to
your
own
town
your
own
neighbourhood
and
to
strike
you
through
your
son
it
is
the
nastiest
most
underhanded
unprincipled
attack
i
ever
heard
of
what
is
that
asked
reginald
he
was
not
easily
roused
by
carlingford
gossip
but
there
was
clearly
more
in
this
than
met
the
eye
an
church
meeting
said
may
with
special
compliments
in
it
to
you
and
me
it
is
not
worth
our
while
to
think
of
it
your
agitators
my
dear
hurst
are
not
worth
powder
and
shot
now
pardon
me
but
i
must
go
to
work
will
you
go
and
see
the
sick
people
in
back
grove
street
reginald
i
do
think
i
can
go
i
should
like
to
know
what
was
in
the
paper
said
the
young
man
with
an
obstinacy
that
filled
the
girls
with
alarm
they
had
been
in
hopes
that
everything
between
father
and
son
was
to
be
happy
and
friendly
now
that
reginald
was
about
to
do
what
his
father
wished
oh
you
shall
see
it
said
hurst
half
alarmed
too
but
it
is
not
anything
as
your
father
says
only
we
women
are
sensitive
we
are
always
thinking
of
things
which
perhaps
were
never
intended
to
harm
us
ursula
you
take
my
advice
and
do
go
and
mix
yourself
up
with
dissenters
and
that
kind
of
people
the
tozer
girl
may
be
very
nice
but
she
is
still
tozer
granddaughter
after
all
reginald
followed
the
visitor
out
of
the
room
leaving
his
sisters
very
ill
at
ease
within
and
his
father
not
without
anxieties
which
were
so
powerful
indeed
that
he
relieved
his
mind
by
talking
of
them
to
his
daughters
a
most
unusual
proceeding
that
woman
will
set
reginald
off
at
the
nail
again
he
cried
after
he
had
begun
to
see
things
in
a
light
there
was
an
attack
made
upon
him
last
night
on
account
of
that
blessed
chaplaincy
which
has
been
more
trouble
to
me
than
it
is
worth
i
suppose
he
throw
it
up
now
but
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
matter
i
wonder
how
you
girls
can
encourage
that
chattering
woman
to
come
here
papa
cried
janey
ever
on
the
defensive
we
her
it
is
you
who
encourage
her
to
come
here
oh
hush
cried
ursula
with
a
warning
glance
it
was
balm
to
her
soul
to
hear
her
father
call
hurst
we
have
been
to
see
the
house
she
said
it
was
very
nice
i
think
reginald
liked
it
papa
ah
well
said
may
girls
and
boys
are
queer
articles
i
dare
say
the
house
if
he
likes
it
will
weigh
more
with
him
than
justice
or
common
sense
so
copperhead
was
the
people
name
what
would
be
wanted
do
you
think
ursula
to
make
reginald
room
into
a
comfortable
room
for
a
pupil
comfortable
recollect
not
merely
what
would
do
and
one
that
has
been
used
i
suppose
to
luxury
you
can
look
over
it
and
let
me
know
are
we
going
to
take
a
pupil
papa
cried
janey
with
widening
eyes
i
do
know
what
you
could
teach
him
he
said
manners
perhaps
let
me
know
ursula
the
room
is
not
a
bad
room
it
would
want
a
new
carpet
curtains
perhaps
various
things
make
me
out
a
list
the
copperheads
have
a
son
i
believe
did
you
see
him
at
that
fine
ball
of
yours
oh
papa
he
danced
with
me
twice
he
was
very
kind
said
ursula
with
a
blush
and
he
danced
all
the
night
with
miss
beecham
it
must
be
a
falsehood
about
her
being
old
tozer
granddaughter
clarence
copperhead
was
always
by
her
side
i
think
hurst
must
have
made
it
all
up
out
of
her
own
head
may
gave
a
little
short
laugh
poor
mrs
hurst
he
said
recovering
his
temper
how
bitter
you
all
are
against
her
so
he
danced
with
you
twice
you
must
try
to
make
him
comfortable
ursula
if
he
comes
here
is
clarence
copperhead
coming
here
ursula
was
struck
dumb
by
this
piece
of
news
the
grand
house
in
portland
place
and
all
sophy
dorset
questions
and
warnings
came
suddenly
back
to
her
mind
she
blushed
fiery
red
she
could
not
tell
why
coming
here
how
strange
it
would
be
how
extraordinary
to
have
to
order
dinner
for
him
and
get
his
room
in
order
and
have
him
in
the
in
the
evenings
how
should
she
know
what
to
say
to
him
or
would
papa
keep
him
always
at
work
reading
greek
or
something
downstairs
all
this
flashed
through
her
mind
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
may
made
no
reply
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
hands
behind
him
as
was
his
habit
when
he
was
busy
being
busy
was
separated
from
being
angry
by
the
merest
visionary
line
in
may
case
his
children
never
ventured
on
addressing
him
at
such
moments
and
it
is
impossible
to
describe
how
glad
they
were
when
he
withdrew
to
his
own
room
before
reginald
return
but
not
a
minute
too
soon
the
young
man
came
back
looking
black
as
night
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
then
he
got
up
again
and
began
also
to
walk
about
the
room
like
his
father
at
first
he
would
make
no
reply
to
the
questions
of
the
girls
it
is
exactly
what
i
expected
he
said
just
what
i
looked
for
i
knew
it
from
the
first
moment
it
was
janey
naturally
who
had
least
patience
with
this
unsatisfactory
utterance
if
it
was
just
what
you
expected
and
you
looked
for
it
all
the
time
why
should
you
make
such
a
fuss
now
she
cried
i
declare
for
all
you
are
young
and
we
are
fond
of
you
you
are
almost
as
bad
as
papa
reginald
did
not
take
any
notice
of
this
address
he
went
on
repeating
the
same
words
at
intervals
a
child
might
have
known
it
of
course
from
the
beginning
one
knew
how
it
must
be
then
he
suddenly
faced
round
upon
ursula
who
was
nearly
crying
in
excitement
and
surprise
but
if
they
think
i
am
to
be
driven
out
of
a
resolution
i
have
made
by
what
they
say
if
they
think
that
i
will
be
bullied
into
giving
up
because
of
their
claptrap
he
cried
looking
sternly
at
her
then
you
will
find
you
are
mistaken
you
will
find
i
am
not
such
a
weak
idiot
as
you
suppose
give
up
because
some
demagogue
from
a
dissenting
committee
takes
upon
him
to
criticise
my
conduct
if
you
think
i
have
so
little
so
little
stamina
he
said
fiercely
you
will
find
you
have
made
a
very
great
mistake
oh
reginald
cried
ursula
with
tears
in
her
eyes
did
i
ever
think
anything
unkind
of
you
did
i
ever
ask
you
to
do
anything
that
was
disagreeable
you
should
not
look
as
if
it
was
me
then
he
threw
himself
down
again
on
the
old
sofa
which
creaked
and
tottered
under
the
shock
poor
little
ursula
he
cried
with
a
short
laugh
did
you
think
i
meant
you
but
if
they
thought
they
would
master
me
by
these
means
said
reginald
with
pale
fury
they
never
made
a
greater
mistake
i
can
tell
you
a
parcel
of
trumpery
agitators
speechifiers
little
petty
demagogues
whom
nobody
ever
heard
of
before
a
fine
thing
indeed
to
have
all
the
shopkeepers
of
carlingford
sitting
in
committee
on
conduct
is
it
telling
one
what
one
ought
to
do
by
jupiter
enough
to
make
a
man
swear
i
declare
cried
janey
loudly
how
like
reginald
is
to
papa
i
never
saw
it
before
when
he
looks
wicked
like
that
and
sets
his
teeth
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
pushed
not
by
my
brother
or
any
one
said
the
girl
growing
red
and
making
a
step
out
of
his
reach
i
wo
stand
it
i
am
not
a
child
any
more
than
you
janey
wrath
was
appeased
however
when
reginald
produced
the
paper
and
read
northcote
speech
aloud
in
her
interest
she
drew
nearer
and
nearer
and
read
the
obnoxious
column
over
his
shoulder
joining
in
ursula
cries
of
indignation
by
the
time
the
three
had
thus
got
through
it
reginald
own
agitation
subsided
into
that
fierce
amusement
which
is
the
frequent
refuge
of
the
assaulted
old
green
in
the
chair
and
old
tozer
and
the
rest
have
all
been
sitting
upon
me
he
said
with
that
laugh
which
is
proverbially
described
as
from
the
wrong
side
of
the
mouth
whatever
that
may
be
ursula
said
nothing
in
reply
but
in
her
heart
she
felt
yet
another
stab
tozer
this
was
another
complication
she
had
taken
so
great
a
romantic
interest
in
the
heroine
of
that
ball
which
was
the
most
entrancing
moment
of
ursula
life
that
it
seemed
a
kind
of
disloyalty
to
her
dreams
to
give
up
thus
completely
and
dethrone
the
young
lady
in
black
but
what
could
the
poor
girl
do
in
the
excitement
of
this
question
the
personality
of
reginald
special
assailant
was
lost
altogether
the
girls
did
not
even
remember
his
name
chapter
xxi
a
new
friend
after
this
there
followed
an
exciting
interval
for
the
family
at
the
parsonage
reginald
with
the
impatience
of
anger
insisted
upon
transporting
himself
to
the
college
at
once
and
entering
upon
his
duties
such
as
they
were
in
defiance
of
all
public
comment
and
may
delighted
with
the
resentment
which
served
his
purpose
so
well
promoted
it
by
all
the
means
in
his
power
goading
his
son
on
if
he
showed
any
signs
of
relaxing
by
references
to
public
opinion
and
what
the
liberation
society
would
say
before
those
curtains
were
ready
which
the
girls
had
ordered
with
so
much
pride
or
the
carpet
laid
down
he
had
taken
possession
and
his
room
in
the
parsonage
was
already
turned
upside
down
preparing
for
a
new
inmate
many
and
strange
were
the
thoughts
in
ursula
mind
about
this
new
inmate
she
remembered
clarence
copperhead
as
a
man
beyond
it
seemed
to
her
the
age
at
which
pupilage
was
possible
what
was
he
coming
to
carlingford
for
what
was
he
coming
to
the
parsonage
for
what
could
papa
do
with
a
pupil
quite
as
old
as
reginald
who
in
his
own
person
had
often
taken
pupils
ursula
had
read
as
many
novels
as
were
natural
at
her
age
and
can
it
be
supposed
that
she
did
not
ask
herself
whether
there
was
any
other
meaning
in
it
could
he
be
coming
to
carlingford
on
account
of
miss
beecham
or
on
account
of
any
one
else
ursula
never
whispered
even
to
her
own
imagination
on
account
of
me
but
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
unbidden
inarticulate
thought
did
not
steal
in
fluttering
her
girlish
soul
everybody
knows
that
in
fiction
at
least
such
things
occur
continually
and
are
the
most
natural
things
in
the
world
and
to
ursula
beyond
her
own
little
commonplace
world
which
she
somewhat
despised
and
the
strange
world
undeciphered
and
wonderful
to
which
the
dorsets
had
introduced
her
for
those
ten
brief
days
in
london
the
world
of
fiction
was
the
only
sphere
she
knew
and
in
that
sphere
there
could
be
no
such
natural
method
of
accounting
for
a
young
actions
as
that
of
supposing
him
to
be
in
love
the
question
remained
was
it
with
miss
beecham
or
was
it
with
anybody
else
such
an
inquiry
could
not
but
flutter
her
youthful
bosom
she
made
his
room
ready
for
him
and
settled
how
he
was
to
be
disposed
of
with
the
strangest
sense
of
something
beneath
which
her
father
would
never
suspect
but
which
perhaps
she
alone
might
know
clarence
copperhead
was
a
more
imposing
figure
to
ursula
than
he
was
in
reality
she
had
seen
him
only
twice
and
he
was
a
big
and
gentleman
while
ursula
only
realised
herself
as
a
little
girl
she
was
not
even
aware
that
she
had
any
intelligence
to
speak
of
or
that
she
would
be
a
fit
person
to
judge
of
a
gentleman
to
be
sure
she
had
to
do
many
things
which
wanted
thought
and
sense
but
she
was
too
unthoughtful
of
herself
to
have
decided
this
as
yet
or
to
have
created
any
private
tribunal
at
which
to
judge
a
of
clarence
copperhead
dimensions
a
much
greater
personage
than
she
was
an
individual
whose
comings
and
goings
could
not
be
without
observation
whose
notice
would
be
something
exciting
and
strange
was
what
she
took
him
to
be
and
ursula
was
excited
did
copperhead
that
kind
little
woman
know
why
he
was
coming
was
she
in
his
confidence
and
how
was
ursula
to
entertain
him
to
talk
to
him
a
gentleman
accustomed
to
so
much
better
society
she
did
not
say
anything
to
janey
on
this
subject
though
janey
was
not
without
her
curiosities
too
and
openly
indulged
in
conjectures
as
to
the
new
pupil
i
wonder
if
he
will
be
fine
i
wonder
if
he
will
be
very
good
said
janey
i
wonder
if
he
will
fall
in
love
with
ursula
pupils
in
books
always
do
and
then
there
is
a
dreadful
fuss
and
bother
and
the
girl
is
sent
away
it
is
hard
for
the
girl
it
is
always
supposed
to
be
her
fault
i
would
not
allow
papa
to
take
any
pupils
if
it
was
me
and
much
your
papa
would
care
for
your
permission
said
sam
hurst
but
so
far
i
agree
with
you
janey
that
before
he
has
pupils
or
anything
of
that
sort
there
ought
to
be
a
lady
in
the
house
he
should
marry
marry
we
do
want
a
lady
in
the
house
cried
janey
we
are
ladies
ourselves
i
hope
marry
if
he
does
i
for
one
will
do
all
i
can
to
make
his
life
miserable
said
the
girl
with
energy
what
should
he
want
to
marry
for
when
he
has
daughters
grown
up
there
are
enough
of
us
already
i
should
think
too
many
said
sam
hurst
with
a
sigh
it
gave
her
the
greatest
secret
delight
to
play
upon
the
girl
fears
besides
this
however
ursula
had
another
in
that
cordial
meeting
with
the
young
lady
who
had
turned
out
to
be
a
person
in
such
an
embarrassing
position
there
had
been
a
great
deal
said
about
future
meetings
walks
and
expeditions
together
and
ursula
had
been
very
desirous
that
phoebe
should
fix
some
time
for
their
first
encounter
she
thought
of
this
now
with
blushes
that
seemed
to
burn
her
cheeks
she
was
afraid
to
go
out
lest
she
should
meet
the
girl
she
had
been
so
anxious
to
make
a
friend
of
not
that
on
her
own
account
after
the
first
shock
ursula
would
have
been
enough
to
deny
her
acquaintance
to
tozer
granddaughter
in
the
seclusion
of
her
chamber
she
had
cried
over
the
downfall
of
her
ideal
friend
very
bitterly
and
felt
the
humiliation
for
phoebe
more
cruelly
than
that
young
lady
felt
it
for
herself
but
ursula
however
much
it
might
have
cost
her
would
have
stood
fast
to
her
friendship
had
she
been
free
to
do
as
she
pleased
i
did
not
like
her
for
her
grandfather
she
said
to
janey
of
whom
in
this
case
she
was
less
unwilling
to
make
a
confidant
i
never
thought
of
the
grandfather
what
does
it
matter
to
me
if
he
were
a
sweep
instead
of
old
tozer
old
tozer
is
just
as
bad
as
if
he
were
a
sweep
said
janey
if
you
had
ever
thought
of
her
grandfather
and
known
he
was
old
tozer
you
would
have
felt
it
would
not
do
what
is
there
about
a
grandfather
i
do
know
if
we
ever
had
any
said
ursula
mamma
had
for
the
dorsets
are
her
relations
but
papa
griffiths
grandfather
was
a
i
have
heard
papa
say
so
and
they
go
everywhere
but
he
is
dead
said
janey
with
great
shrewdness
and
he
was
rich
you
little
nasty
calculating
thing
oh
how
i
hate
rich
people
how
i
hate
this
horrid
world
that
loves
money
and
loves
fine
names
and
does
not
care
for
people
selves
whether
they
are
bad
or
good
i
shall
never
dare
to
walk
up
grange
lane
again
said
ursula
with
tears
fancy
changing
to
her
after
being
so
glad
to
see
her
fancy
never
saying
another
word
about
the
skating
or
the
walk
to
the
old
mill
how
she
will
despise
me
for
being
such
a
miserable
creature
and
she
will
think
it
is
all
my
own
fault
at
this
moment
may
from
the
door
of
his
study
called
ursula
repeating
the
call
with
some
impatience
when
she
paused
to
dry
her
eyes
she
ran
down
to
him
quickly
throwing
down
her
work
in
her
haste
he
was
standing
at
the
door
and
somehow
for
the
first
time
the
worn
look
about
his
eyes
struck
ursula
with
a
touch
of
pity
she
had
never
noticed
it
before
a
look
of
suppressed
pain
and
anxiety
which
remained
about
his
eyes
though
the
mouth
smiled
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
to
be
sorry
for
her
father
before
and
the
idea
struck
her
as
very
strange
now
come
in
he
said
i
want
to
speak
to
you
i
have
been
thinking
about
the
young
woman
this
friend
of
yours
we
are
all
among
the
dissenters
whatever
sam
hurst
may
say
you
seem
to
have
taken
a
fancy
to
this
tozer
girl
do
call
her
so
papa
please
she
is
a
lady
in
herself
as
good
a
lady
as
any
one
well
i
do
say
anything
against
her
do
i
so
you
hold
by
your
fancy
you
are
not
afraid
of
grange
lane
and
sam
hurst
i
have
not
seen
her
again
said
ursula
cast
down
i
have
not
been
out
at
all
i
could
not
bear
to
be
so
friendly
one
day
and
then
to
pass
as
if
one
did
not
know
her
the
next
i
can
not
do
it
cried
the
girl
in
tears
if
i
see
her
i
must
just
be
the
same
as
usual
to
her
whatever
you
say
very
well
the
same
as
usual
said
may
that
is
why
i
called
you
i
have
my
reasons
notwithstanding
tozer
be
civil
to
the
girl
i
have
my
reasons
for
what
i
say
do
you
mean
it
papa
said
ursula
delighted
oh
how
good
of
you
you
do
mind
you
really
do
mind
oh
i
ca
tell
you
how
thankful
i
am
for
to
pretend
to
want
to
be
friends
and
then
to
break
off
all
in
a
moment
because
of
a
girl
grandfather
do
make
a
principle
of
it
ursula
it
is
quite
necessary
in
an
ordinary
way
to
think
of
a
girl
grandfather
and
a
boy
too
for
that
matter
no
shopkeeping
friends
for
me
but
in
this
individual
case
i
am
willing
to
make
an
exception
for
the
moment
you
see
dissenters
are
in
the
ascendant
young
copperhead
is
coming
next
week
now
go
ursula
marched
delighted
upstairs
janey
run
and
get
your
hat
she
said
i
am
going
out
i
am
not
afraid
of
any
one
now
papa
is
a
great
deal
nicer
than
he
ever
was
before
he
says
i
may
see
miss
beecham
as
much
as
i
like
he
says
we
need
not
mind
sam
hurst
i
am
so
glad
i
shall
never
be
afraid
of
that
woman
any
more
janey
was
taken
altogether
by
surprise
i
hope
he
is
not
going
to
fall
in
love
with
miss
beecham
she
said
suspiciously
i
have
heard
betsy
say
that
old
gentlemen
often
do
he
is
not
so
foolish
as
to
fall
in
love
with
anybody
said
ursula
with
dignity
indeed
janey
you
ought
to
have
much
more
respect
for
papa
i
wish
you
could
be
sent
to
school
and
learn
more
sense
you
give
your
opinion
as
if
you
were
twenty
more
than
that
i
am
sure
i
never
should
have
ventured
to
say
such
things
when
i
was
a
child
like
you
child
yourself
said
janey
indignant
which
was
her
last
resource
when
she
had
nothing
more
to
say
but
ursula
was
too
busy
putting
aside
her
work
and
preparing
for
her
walk
to
pay
any
attention
in
proportion
as
she
had
been
subdued
and
downcast
heretofore
she
was
gay
now
she
forgot
all
about
old
tozer
about
the
dissenters
meeting
and
the
man
who
had
made
an
attack
upon
poor
reginald
she
flew
to
her
room
for
her
hat
and
jacket
and
ran
downstairs
singing
to
herself
janey
only
overtook
her
out
of
breath
as
she
emerged
into
the
road
from
the
parsonage
door
what
a
dreadful
hurry
you
are
in
said
janey
i
always
get
ready
so
much
quicker
than
you
do
is
it
all
about
this
girl
because
she
is
new
i
never
knew
you
were
so
fond
of
new
people
before
but
that
day
they
went
up
and
down
grange
lane
fruitlessly
without
seeing
anything
of
phoebe
and
ursula
returned
home
disconsolate
in
the
evening
reginald
intimated
carelessly
that
he
had
met
miss
beecham
she
is
much
better
worth
talking
to
than
most
of
the
girls
one
meets
with
whoever
her
grandfather
may
be
he
said
evidently
with
an
instant
readiness
to
stand
on
the
defensive
oh
did
you
talk
to
her
said
ursula
without
knowing
reginald
papa
has
no
objections
he
says
we
may
even
have
her
here
if
we
please
well
of
course
i
suppose
he
must
guide
you
in
that
respect
said
reginald
but
it
does
not
matter
particularly
to
me
of
course
i
talked
to
her
even
my
father
could
not
expect
that
his
permission
was
needed
for
me
at
which
piece
of
the
girls
looked
at
him
with
admiring
eyes
already
they
felt
there
was
a
difference
reginald
at
home
nominal
curate
without
pay
or
position
was
a
different
thing
from
reginald
with
an
appointment
a
house
of
his
own
and
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
the
girls
looked
at
him
admiringly
but
felt
that
this
was
never
likely
to
be
their
fate
in
everything
the
boys
had
so
much
the
best
of
it
and
yet
it
was
almost
a
comfort
to
think
that
they
had
seen
reginald
himself
trembling
before
papa
reginald
had
a
great
deal
to
tell
them
about
the
college
about
the
old
men
who
made
a
hundred
daily
claims
on
his
attention
and
the
charities
which
he
had
to
administer
doles
of
this
and
that
and
several
charity
schools
of
a
humble
class
as
for
my
time
it
is
not
likely
to
hang
on
my
hands
as
i
thought
i
ca
be
a
parish
quixote
as
we
planned
ursula
knocking
down
windmills
for
other
people
he
said
adjusting
his
round
edge
of
collar
he
was
changed
he
was
important
a
personage
in
his
own
sight
no
longer
to
be
spoken
of
as
may
son
janey
ventured
on
a
little
laugh
when
he
went
away
but
ursula
did
not
like
the
change
never
mind
cried
janey
i
hope
copperhead
will
be
nice
we
shall
have
him
to
talk
to
when
he
comes
oh
cried
ursula
in
a
kind
of
despair
who
taught
you
to
call
gentlemen
like
that
by
their
name
there
is
nothing
so
vulgar
why
cousin
anne
says
oh
cousin
anne
cried
janey
shaking
her
head
and
dancing
away
after
that
she
was
aware
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
flight
next
day
however
they
were
more
successful
phoebe
though
very
little
older
than
ursula
was
kind
to
the
country
girls
and
talked
to
them
both
and
drew
them
out
she
smiled
when
she
heard
of
clarence
copperhead
and
told
them
that
he
was
not
very
clever
but
she
did
not
think
there
was
any
harm
in
him
it
is
his
father
who
is
disagreeable
said
phoebe
did
you
think
so
you
know
papa
is
a
minister
miss
may
she
did
not
say
clergyman
when
she
spoke
to
a
churchwoman
for
what
was
the
use
of
exciting
any
one
prejudices
and
copperhead
comes
to
our
church
you
may
be
very
thankful
in
that
respect
that
you
are
not
a
dissenter
but
it
will
be
very
strange
to
see
clarence
copperhead
in
carlingford
i
have
known
him
since
i
was
no
bigger
than
your
little
sister
to
tell
the
truth
said
phoebe
frankly
i
think
i
am
rather
sorry
he
is
coming
here
why
cried
bold
janey
who
was
always
inquisitive
miss
phoebe
only
smiled
and
shook
her
head
she
made
no
distinct
reply
poor
fellow
i
suppose
he
has
been
as
the
gentlemen
call
it
or
does
your
brother
say
university
slang
is
very
droll
he
has
not
taken
his
degree
i
suppose
and
they
want
him
to
work
before
going
up
again
i
am
sorry
for
your
father
too
for
i
think
it
will
be
very
easy
to
get
anything
into
clarence
mind
but
there
is
no
harm
at
all
in
him
and
he
used
to
be
very
nice
to
his
mother
mamma
and
i
liked
him
for
that
he
was
always
very
nice
to
his
mother
will
you
come
in
and
have
some
tea
said
ursula
do
please
i
hope
now
that
i
have
met
you
again
you
will
not
refuse
me
i
was
afraid
you
had
gone
away
or
something
ursula
however
could
not
help
looking
guilty
as
she
spoke
and
phoebe
perceived
at
once
that
there
had
been
some
reason
for
the
two
or
three
days
disappearance
of
the
girls
from
grange
lane
you
must
tell
me
first
she
said
with
a
smile
whether
you
know
who
i
am
if
you
ask
me
after
that
i
shall
come
i
am
old
granddaughter
who
had
a
shop
in
the
high
street
my
uncle
has
a
shop
there
now
i
do
not
like
it
myself
said
phoebe
with
the
masterly
candour
that
distinguished
her
and
no
one
else
can
be
expected
to
like
it
if
you
did
not
know
oh
we
heard
directly
cried
janey
sam
hurst
told
us
she
came
shrieking
is
she
before
your
back
was
turned
that
day
for
she
wondered
to
see
you
with
old
tozer
janey
cried
ursula
with
horror
of
course
we
know
and
please
will
you
come
every
new
person
in
carlingford
gets
talked
over
and
if
an
angel
were
to
walk
about
sam
hurst
would
never
rest
till
she
had
found
out
where
he
came
from
and
perhaps
whether
he
had
a
broken
feather
in
his
wing
said
phoebe
i
am
very
glad
you
do
mind
it
will
be
very
pleasant
to
come
i
will
run
in
and
tell
them
and
then
i
will
join
you
grandmamma
is
an
invalid
and
would
like
to
know
where
i
am
and
the
news
made
a
considerable
flutter
in
the
dim
room
where
tozer
sat
between
the
fire
and
the
window
looking
out
upon
the
crocuses
and
regretting
the
high
street
but
run
and
put
on
another
dress
dear
what
will
they
think
of
you
in
that
everlasting
brown
frock
as
you
so
fond
of
i
like
them
to
see
as
my
grandchild
could
dress
as
nice
as
any
lady
in
the
land
she
not
see
much
finery
there
said
tozer
they
as
poor
as
church
mice
are
them
mays
and
never
a
penny
to
pay
a
bill
when
wanted
i
do
think
as
phoebe
need
mind
her
dressing
to
go
there
and
you
send
for
me
if
you
want
me
grandmamma
you
will
be
sure
to
send
but
for
the
brown
frock
tozer
satisfaction
would
have
been
unalloyed
as
she
watched
her
granddaughter
walking
across
the
garden
she
at
home
among
the
quality
she
is
said
the
old
woman
maybe
more
so
than
she
is
with
you
and
me
but
there
ai
a
better
girl
in
all
england
and
that
i
say
for
her
though
if
she
would
think
a
little
more
about
her
clothes
as
is
at
her
age
it
would
be
more
pleasing
to
me
the
worst
dress
as
phoebe
has
is
better
than
anything
belonging
to
them
mays
said
tozer
he
did
not
care
for
the
parson
at
roque
though
he
was
pleased
that
his
child
should
be
among
the
quality
but
it
was
on
that
evening
that
poor
old
tozer
had
one
of
her
attacks
and
phoebe
had
to
be
summoned
back
at
an
early
hour
the
servant
went
down
with
an
umbrella
and
a
note
to
bring
her
home
and
that
trifling
incident
had
its
influence
upon
after
affairs
as
the
reader
shall
shortly
see
chapter
xxii
a
desperate
expedient
it
was
something
of
a
comfort
to
phoebe
to
find
that
the
tea
to
which
ursula
asked
her
was
a
family
meal
such
as
and
tozer
indulged
in
in
grange
lane
with
no
idea
of
dinner
to
follow
as
in
more
refined
circles
this
she
said
to
herself
benignly
must
be
country
fashion
and
she
was
naturally
as
bland
and
gracious
at
the
parsonage
as
anybody
from
town
knowing
better
but
desiring
to
make
herself
thoroughly
agreeable
could
be
she
amused
may
very
much
who
felt
the
serene
young
princess
accepting
her
vulgar
relations
with
gentle
resignation
and
supported
by
a
feeling
of
her
own
innate
dignity
to
be
something
quite
new
to
him
phoebe
had
no
objection
to
talk
upon
the
subject
for
clever
as
she
was
she
was
not
so
clever
as
to
see
through
may
amused
show
of
interest
in
her
trials
but
believed
ingenuously
that
he
understood
and
felt
for
her
and
was
perhaps
at
last
the
one
noble
impartial
and
generous
churchman
who
could
see
the
difficulties
of
cultivated
dissenters
and
enter
into
them
sympathetically
why
may
took
the
trouble
to
draw
her
out
on
this
point
it
is
more
difficult
to
explain
poor
man
he
was
in
a
state
of
over
cotsdean
bill
the
ten
days
had
shortened
into
three
and
he
was
no
nearer
finding
that
hundred
pounds
than
ever
even
while
he
smiled
and
talked
to
phoebe
he
was
repeating
over
and
over
to
himself
the
terrible
fact
which
could
not
now
be
ignored
and
friday
will
be
the
he
was
saying
to
himself
if
that
came
without
any
help
cotsdean
would
be
virtually
made
a
bankrupt
for
of
course
all
his
creditors
would
make
a
rush
upon
him
and
all
his
affairs
would
be
thrown
open
to
the
remorseless
public
gaze
if
the
bill
which
had
been
so
often
renewed
had
to
be
dishonoured
at
last
may
had
a
conscience
though
he
was
not
careful
of
his
money
and
the
fear
of
ruin
to
cotsdean
was
a
very
terrible
and
real
oppression
to
him
the
recollection
was
upon
him
like
a
vulture
in
classic
story
tearing
and
gnawing
as
he
sat
there
and
smiled
over
the
cup
of
tea
ursula
gave
him
feeling
amused
all
the
same
at
phoebe
talk
he
could
scarcely
have
told
why
he
had
permitted
his
daughter
to
pursue
her
acquaintance
with
tozer
granddaughter
partly
it
was
because
of
clarence
copperhead
out
of
curiosity
as
being
about
to
be
brought
in
contact
with
some
south
sea
islander
or
fijian
one
would
naturally
wish
to
see
another
who
was
thrown
in
one
way
by
accident
and
thus
prepare
one
self
for
the
permanent
acquaintance
and
she
amused
him
her
cleverness
her
ease
her
conversational
powers
her
woman
of
the
world
aspect
did
not
so
much
impress
him
perhaps
as
they
did
others
but
the
complacency
and
innocent
confidence
of
youth
that
were
in
her
and
her
own
enjoyment
of
the
situation
notwithstanding
the
mortifications
incurred
all
this
amused
may
he
listened
to
her
talk
sometimes
feeling
himself
almost
unable
to
bear
it
for
the
misery
of
those
words
which
kept
themselves
ringing
in
a
dismal
chorus
in
his
own
mind
and
yet
deriving
a
kind
of
amusement
and
distraction
from
it
all
the
same
one
of
your
friends
was
very
hard
upon
my
son
and
myself
at
your
meeting
the
other
night
miss
beecham
he
was
very
injudicious
said
phoebe
shaking
her
head
indeed
i
did
not
approve
personalities
never
advance
any
cause
i
said
so
to
him
do
you
think
the
church
has
herself
to
blame
for
those
political
dissenters
may
you
sneer
at
us
and
look
down
upon
us
i
i
do
sneer
at
anybody
i
do
mean
you
individually
but
churchmen
do
they
treat
us
as
if
we
were
some
strange
kind
of
creatures
from
the
heart
of
africa
perhaps
they
do
think
we
are
just
like
themselves
as
well
educated
meaning
as
well
with
as
much
right
to
our
own
ideas
may
could
scarcely
restrain
a
laugh
just
like
themselves
the
idea
of
a
dissenter
setting
up
to
be
as
well
educated
and
as
capable
of
forming
an
opinion
as
a
cultivated
anglican
an
oxford
man
and
a
beneficed
clergyman
was
too
novel
and
too
foolish
not
to
be
somewhat
startling
as
well
may
was
aware
that
human
nature
is
strangely
blind
to
its
own
deficiencies
but
was
it
possible
that
any
delusion
could
go
so
far
as
this
he
did
laugh
a
little
just
the
ghost
of
a
laugh
at
the
idea
but
what
is
the
use
of
making
any
serious
opposition
to
such
a
statement
the
very
fact
of
contesting
the
assumption
seemed
to
give
it
a
certain
weight
whenever
this
is
done
said
phoebe
with
serene
philosophy
i
think
you
may
expect
a
revulsion
of
feeling
the
class
to
which
papa
belongs
is
very
friendly
to
the
established
church
and
wishes
to
do
her
every
honour
is
it
indeed
we
ought
to
be
much
gratified
said
may
phoebe
gave
him
a
quick
glance
but
he
composed
his
face
and
met
her
look
meekly
it
actually
diverted
him
from
his
and
that
is
a
great
deal
to
say
we
would
willingly
do
her
any
honour
we
would
willingly
be
friends
even
look
up
to
her
if
that
would
please
her
added
phoebe
very
gravely
conscious
of
the
importance
of
what
she
was
saying
but
when
we
see
clergymen
and
common
persons
also
who
have
never
had
one
rational
thought
on
the
subject
always
setting
us
down
as
ignorant
and
uncultured
because
we
are
dissenters
but
no
one
does
that
said
ursula
soothingly
eager
to
save
her
new
friend
feelings
she
paused
in
the
act
of
pouring
out
the
second
cup
of
tea
and
looked
up
at
her
with
eyes
full
of
caressing
and
flattering
meaning
no
one
at
least
i
am
sure
she
added
faltering
remembering
suddenly
things
she
had
heard
said
of
dissenters
who
knows
it
is
not
i
that
ought
to
be
thought
of
it
is
the
general
question
then
can
you
wonder
that
a
young
man
like
the
gentleman
we
were
talking
of
clever
and
energetic
and
an
excellent
scholar
and
very
good
in
philosophy
too
he
was
at
jena
for
two
or
three
years
should
be
made
bitter
when
he
feels
himself
thrust
back
upon
a
community
of
small
shopkeepers
may
could
not
restrain
another
short
laugh
we
must
not
join
in
the
vulgar
abuse
of
shopkeepers
he
said
phoebe
colour
rose
she
raised
her
head
a
little
then
perceiving
the
superiority
of
her
former
position
smiled
i
have
no
right
to
do
so
my
people
i
suppose
were
all
shopkeepers
to
begin
with
but
this
gives
me
ways
of
knowing
grandpapa
is
very
kind
and
nice
really
nice
may
but
he
has
not
at
all
a
wide
way
of
looking
at
things
i
feel
it
though
they
are
so
kind
to
me
i
have
been
brought
up
to
think
in
such
a
different
way
and
if
i
feel
it
who
am
fond
of
them
think
how
that
young
minister
must
feel
it
who
was
brought
up
in
a
totally
different
class
what
kind
of
class
was
this
one
brought
up
in
said
may
with
a
laugh
he
need
not
have
assaulted
reginald
if
he
had
been
born
a
prince
we
had
done
him
no
harm
that
is
making
it
entirely
a
private
question
said
phoebe
suavely
which
i
did
not
mean
to
do
when
such
a
man
finds
out
abuses
what
he
takes
to
be
abuses
in
the
church
which
treats
him
like
a
roadside
ranter
may
not
he
feel
a
right
to
be
indignant
oh
i
am
not
so
i
think
such
an
office
as
that
chaplaincy
is
very
good
one
here
and
there
for
the
reward
of
merit
and
i
think
he
was
very
right
to
take
it
but
still
it
would
not
do
would
it
to
have
many
of
them
it
would
not
answer
any
good
purpose
she
said
administering
a
little
sting
scientifically
if
all
clergymen
held
sinecures
these
words
were
overheard
by
reginald
who
just
then
came
in
and
to
whom
it
was
startling
to
find
phoebe
serenely
seated
at
tea
with
his
family
the
hated
word
sinecure
did
not
seem
to
affect
him
from
her
lips
as
it
would
have
done
from
any
one
else
he
came
in
quite
and
said
with
a
smile
you
are
discussing
me
what
about
me
miss
beecham
i
hope
you
take
my
side
i
take
everybody
side
said
phoebe
for
i
try
to
trace
motives
i
can
sympathise
both
with
you
and
those
who
assailed
you
oh
that
dissenting
fellow
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
beecham
if
you
are
a
dissenter
but
i
can
not
help
it
we
never
go
out
of
our
way
to
attack
them
and
their
chapels
and
coteries
and
why
should
they
spring
at
our
throats
on
every
occasion
i
think
it
is
hard
and
i
ca
say
i
have
any
charity
to
spare
for
this
individual
what
had
we
done
to
him
ursula
give
me
some
tea
miss
beecham
i
leave
the
cause
of
the
church
in
younger
and
i
hope
abler
hands
said
may
getting
up
partly
it
was
that
reginald
onslaught
made
him
see
for
the
first
time
certain
weak
points
in
the
situation
partly
it
was
that
his
private
care
became
too
clamorous
and
he
could
not
keep
on
further
he
went
away
quite
abruptly
and
went
downstairs
to
his
study
and
shut
himself
in
there
and
the
moment
he
had
closed
the
door
all
this
amusement
floated
away
and
the
vulture
gripped
at
him
beak
and
talons
digging
into
his
very
soul
good
god
what
was
he
to
do
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
turned
round
and
round
mentally
in
that
darkness
to
see
if
anywhere
there
might
be
a
gleam
of
light
but
none
was
visible
east
or
west
a
hundred
pounds
only
a
hundred
pounds
a
bagatelle
a
thing
that
to
many
men
was
as
small
an
affair
as
a
stray
sixpence
and
here
was
this
man
as
good
so
to
speak
as
any
well
educated
full
of
gifts
and
accomplishments
well
born
well
connected
not
a
prodigal
nor
open
sinner
losing
himself
in
the
very
blackness
of
darkness
feeling
that
a
kind
of
moral
extinction
was
the
only
prospect
before
him
for
want
of
this
little
sum
it
seemed
incredible
even
to
himself
as
he
sat
and
brooded
over
it
somehow
surely
there
must
be
a
way
of
deliverance
he
looked
piteously
about
him
in
his
solitude
appealing
to
the
very
blank
walls
to
save
him
what
could
they
do
his
few
books
his
faded
old
furniture
would
scarcely
realize
a
hundred
pounds
if
they
were
sold
all
his
friends
had
been
wearied
out
all
natural
resources
had
failed
james
might
any
day
have
sent
the
money
but
he
had
not
done
so
just
this
special
time
when
it
was
so
hard
to
get
it
james
too
had
failed
and
the
hours
of
this
night
were
stealing
away
like
thieves
so
swift
and
so
noiseless
to
be
followed
by
the
others
and
cotsdean
poor
soul
his
faithful
retainer
would
be
broken
and
ruined
to
do
may
justice
if
it
had
been
only
himself
who
could
be
ruined
he
would
have
felt
it
less
but
it
went
to
his
very
heart
to
think
of
poor
cotsdean
who
had
trusted
in
him
so
entirely
and
to
whom
indeed
he
had
been
very
kind
in
his
day
strife
and
discord
had
been
in
the
poor
man
house
and
perpetual
wretchedness
and
may
had
managed
he
himself
could
scarcely
tell
how
to
set
it
right
he
had
frightened
and
subdued
the
passionate
wife
and
quenched
the
growing
tendencies
to
evil
which
made
her
temper
worse
than
it
was
by
nature
and
had
won
her
back
to
soberness
and
some
kind
of
peace
changing
the
unhappy
house
into
one
of
comparative
comfort
and
cheerfulness
most
people
like
those
best
to
whom
they
have
been
kind
whom
they
have
served
or
benefited
and
in
this
way
may
was
fond
of
cotsdean
who
in
his
turn
had
been
a
very
good
friend
to
his
clergyman
serving
him
as
none
of
his
own
class
could
have
done
going
in
the
face
of
all
his
own
prejudices
and
the
timorousness
of
nature
on
his
account
and
the
result
was
to
be
ruin
ruin
unmitigated
to
the
small
man
who
was
in
business
and
equally
disastrous
though
in
a
less
creditable
way
to
his
employer
it
was
with
a
suppressed
anguish
which
is
indescribable
that
he
sat
there
with
his
face
covered
looking
this
approaching
misery
in
the
face
how
long
he
had
been
there
he
could
scarcely
himself
tell
when
he
heard
a
little
commotion
in
the
hall
the
sounds
of
running
up
and
down
stairs
and
opening
of
doors
he
was
in
a
feverish
and
restless
condition
and
every
stir
roused
him
partly
because
of
that
impatience
in
his
mind
and
partly
because
every
new
thing
seemed
to
have
some
possibility
of
hope
in
it
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
before
he
returned
to
his
seat
something
might
have
occurred
to
him
something
might
have
happened
who
could
tell
it
might
be
the
postman
with
a
letter
containing
that
remittance
from
james
which
still
would
set
all
right
it
might
be
he
rose
suddenly
and
opening
the
door
held
it
ajar
and
looked
out
the
front
door
was
open
and
the
night
air
blowing
chilly
into
the
house
and
on
the
stairs
coming
down
he
heard
the
voices
of
ursula
and
phoebe
ursula
was
pinning
a
shawl
round
her
new
friend
and
consoling
her
i
hope
you
will
find
it
is
nothing
i
am
so
sorry
she
said
oh
i
am
not
very
much
afraid
said
phoebe
she
is
ill
but
not
very
bad
i
hope
and
it
is
not
dangerous
thank
you
so
much
for
letting
me
come
you
will
come
again
said
ursula
kissing
her
promise
that
you
will
come
again
may
listened
with
a
certain
surface
of
amusement
in
his
mind
how
easy
and
facile
these
girlish
loves
and
fancies
were
ursula
knew
nothing
of
this
stranger
and
yet
so
free
were
the
girl
thoughts
so
open
her
heart
to
receive
impressions
that
on
so
short
knowledge
she
had
received
the
other
into
it
with
undoubting
confidence
and
trust
he
did
not
come
forward
himself
to
say
but
he
perceived
that
reginald
followed
downstairs
and
took
his
hat
from
the
table
to
accompany
phoebe
home
as
they
closed
the
outer
door
behind
them
the
last
gust
thus
forcibly
shut
in
made
a
rush
through
the
narrow
hall
and
carried
a
scrap
of
paper
to
may
feet
he
picked
it
up
almost
mechanically
and
carried
it
with
him
to
the
light
and
looked
at
it
without
thought
there
was
not
much
in
it
to
interest
any
one
it
was
the
little
note
which
tozer
had
sent
to
his
granddaughter
by
the
maid
not
prettily
folded
to
begin
with
and
soiled
and
crumpled
by
the
bearer
your
grandmother
is
took
bad
with
one
of
her
attacks
come
back
directly
she
wants
you
badly
saml
tozer
this
was
all
that
was
in
it
may
opened
it
out
on
his
table
with
a
of
that
same
superficial
amusement
which
the
entire
incident
had
caused
him
the
contact
even
momentary
of
his
own
household
with
that
of
tozer
the
old
dissenting
butterman
was
so
droll
an
event
then
he
sank
down
on
his
chair
again
with
a
sigh
the
amusement
dying
out
all
at
once
purely
superficial
as
it
was
amusement
how
strange
that
even
the
idea
of
amusement
should
enter
his
head
in
the
midst
of
his
despair
his
mind
renewed
that
horrible
mechanical
wandering
through
the
dismal
circle
of
which
still
survived
amid
the
chaos
of
his
thoughts
once
or
twice
there
seemed
to
gleam
upon
him
a
stray
glimmer
of
light
through
a
loophole
but
only
to
throw
him
back
again
into
the
darkness
now
and
then
he
roused
himself
with
a
look
of
real
terror
in
his
face
when
there
came
a
noise
outside
what
he
was
afraid
of
was
poor
cotsdean
coming
in
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
his
apologetic
beg
your
pardon
sir
if
he
came
what
could
he
say
to
him
two
days
only
two
days
more
if
may
had
been
less
sensible
and
less
courageous
he
would
most
likely
have
ended
the
matter
by
a
pistol
or
a
dose
of
laudanum
but
fortunately
he
was
too
rational
to
deliver
himself
by
this
desperate
expedient
which
of
course
would
only
have
made
the
burden
more
terrible
upon
the
survivors
if
cotsdean
was
to
be
ruined
and
there
was
no
remedy
may
was
man
enough
to
feel
that
it
was
his
business
to
stand
by
him
not
to
escape
in
any
dastardly
way
but
in
the
mean
time
to
face
cotsdean
and
tell
him
that
he
had
done
and
could
do
nothing
seemed
more
than
the
man
who
had
caused
his
ruin
could
bear
he
moved
about
uneasily
in
his
chair
in
the
anguish
of
his
mind
as
he
did
so
he
pushed
off
some
of
his
papers
from
the
table
with
his
elbow
it
was
some
sort
of
break
in
his
feverish
musings
to
pick
them
up
again
in
a
bundle
without
noticing
what
they
were
he
threw
them
down
in
a
little
heap
before
him
on
the
top
as
it
chanced
came
the
little
dirty
scrap
of
paper
which
ought
to
have
been
tossed
into
the
fire
or
the
basket
saml
tozer
what
was
saml
tozer
to
him
that
his
name
should
stare
him
in
the
face
in
this
obtrusive
way
tozer
the
old
butterman
a
mean
and
ignorant
person
as
far
beneath
may
level
as
it
is
possible
to
imagine
whose
handwriting
it
was
very
strange
to
see
on
anything
but
a
bill
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
it
mechanically
he
had
come
as
it
were
to
the
end
of
all
things
in
those
feverish
musings
he
had
searched
through
his
whole
known
world
for
help
and
found
there
nothing
and
nobody
to
help
him
those
whom
he
had
once
relied
on
were
exhausted
long
ago
his
friends
had
all
dropped
off
from
him
as
far
at
least
as
money
was
concerned
some
of
them
might
put
out
a
hand
to
keep
him
and
his
children
from
starvation
even
now
but
to
pay
bill
never
there
was
no
help
anywhere
nor
any
hope
natural
ways
and
means
were
all
exhausted
and
though
he
was
a
clergyman
he
had
no
such
faith
in
the
supernatural
as
to
hope
much
for
the
succour
of
heaven
heaven
what
could
heaven
do
for
him
did
not
drop
down
out
of
the
skies
there
had
been
a
time
when
he
had
felt
full
faith
in
providence
but
he
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
expect
now
from
that
quarter
more
than
from
any
other
samuel
tozer
why
did
that
name
always
come
uppermost
staring
into
his
very
eyes
it
was
a
curious
signature
the
handwriting
very
rude
and
unrefined
with
odd
illiterate
dashes
and
yet
with
a
kind
of
rough
character
in
it
easy
to
identify
not
difficult
to
copy
what
was
it
that
brought
beads
of
moisture
all
at
once
to
forehead
he
started
up
suddenly
pushing
his
chair
with
a
hoarse
exclamation
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
quickly
as
if
trying
to
escape
from
something
his
heart
jumped
up
in
his
breast
like
a
thing
possessed
of
separate
life
and
thumped
against
his
side
and
beat
with
loud
pulsations
in
his
ears
when
he
caught
sight
of
himself
in
the
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
he
started
as
if
he
had
seen
a
ghost
some
one
else
seemed
to
see
him
seemed
to
pounce
upon
and
seize
him
out
of
that
glass
he
retreated
from
the
reach
of
it
almost
staggering
then
he
returned
to
his
table
what
thought
was
it
that
had
struck
him
so
wildly
like
a
sudden
squall
upon
a
boat
he
sat
down
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
then
putting
out
one
finger
stealthily
drew
the
paper
towards
him
and
studied
it
closely
from
under
the
shadow
of
the
unmoved
hand
which
his
face
well
after
all
what
would
be
the
harm
a
gain
of
three
months
time
during
which
every
sort
of
arrangement
could
be
made
so
nicely
supplies
got
anywhere
everywhere
the
whole
machinery
of
being
set
easily
in
motion
again
and
no
harm
done
to
any
one
this
was
the
real
force
of
the
idea
no
harm
done
to
any
one
long
before
the
three
months
were
out
that
hundred
pounds
a
paltry
business
a
nothing
when
a
man
had
time
before
him
could
be
got
one
might
make
sure
and
where
was
the
harm
would
never
know
it
poor
cotsdean
need
never
have
the
slightest
burden
upon
his
conscience
here
in
the
stillness
of
his
own
room
it
could
all
be
done
as
easily
as
possible
without
a
soul
being
taken
into
confidence
except
that
bloodless
wretch
in
the
glass
with
his
staring
face
may
said
to
himself
only
dimly
sensible
that
this
wretch
was
himself
no
it
would
harm
no
one
that
was
clear
it
never
need
be
known
to
any
one
it
was
a
mere
act
of
borrowing
and
borrowing
was
never
accounted
a
crime
borrowing
not
money
even
only
a
name
and
for
so
short
a
time
no
harm
it
could
do
no
one
in
the
world
any
harm
while
these
reasonings
went
on
in
his
mind
his
heart
dropped
down
again
into
its
right
place
his
pulse
ceased
to
beat
like
the
pistons
of
a
he
came
gradually
to
himself
after
all
what
was
it
not
such
a
great
matter
a
loan
of
something
which
would
neither
enrich
him
who
took
nor
impoverish
him
who
without
being
aware
of
it
should
give
a
nothing
why
people
should
entertain
the
prejudices
they
did
on
the
subject
it
was
difficult
to
see
though
perhaps
he
allowed
candidly
to
himself
it
might
be
dangerous
for
any
ignorant
man
to
follow
the
same
strain
of
thinking
but
in
the
hands
of
a
man
who
was
not
ignorant
who
knew
as
he
himself
did
exactly
how
far
to
go
and
what
might
be
done
done
in
his
own
mind
he
put
a
great
stress
on
this
why
what
was
it
a
thing
which
might
be
of
use
in
an
emergency
and
which
was
absolutely
no
harm
may
was
late
in
leaving
his
room
that
night
it
was
understood
in
the
family
that
he
was
writing
and
all
was
kept
very
quiet
in
the
house
yet
not
sufficiently
quiet
for
janey
when
she
brought
in
the
coffee
placing
it
on
the
table
close
to
the
door
was
startled
by
the
fierceness
of
the
exclamation
with
which
her
father
greeted
her
entrance
what
do
you
want
prying
here
he
said
dropping
his
hand
over
the
writing
prying
himself
said
janey
furiously
when
she
was
up
again
in
the
cheerful
light
of
the
a
great
deal
there
is
to
pry
into
in
that
dreadful
old
study
hush
he
never
likes
to
be
disturbed
in
his
writing
said
ursula
soothingly
and
he
sat
at
his
writing
to
a
much
later
hour
than
usual
and
he
stumbled
upstairs
to
his
in
the
dead
of
the
night
with
the
same
scared
pale
face
which
he
had
seen
in
the
glass
such
a
look
as
that
when
it
once
comes
upon
a
man
face
takes
a
long
time
to
glide
away
but
his
heart
beat
more
tranquilly
and
the
blood
flowed
even
in
his
veins
after
all
where
was
the
harm
chapter
xxiii
tided
over
next
morning
cotsdean
was
mournfully
turning
over
his
ledger
in
the
high
street
wondering
whether
he
should
go
back
to
may
on
another
forlorn
expedition
or
whether
he
should
betray
his
overwhelming
anxiety
to
his
wife
who
knew
nothing
about
the
state
of
affairs
the
shop
was
what
is
called
a
shop
full
of
sacks
of
grain
with
knots
of
done
up
ornamentally
in
the
window
a
stock
not
very
valuable
but
sufficient
and
showing
a
good
if
not
a
very
important
business
a
young
man
behind
attended
to
what
little
business
was
going
on
for
the
master
himself
was
too
much
to
think
of
bushels
of
seed
he
was
as
uneasy
as
may
had
been
on
the
previous
night
and
in
some
respects
even
more
unhappy
for
he
had
no
resource
except
a
sort
of
dumb
faith
in
his
principle
a
feeling
that
he
must
be
able
to
find
out
some
way
of
escape
chequered
by
clouds
of
despondency
sometimes
approaching
despair
for
cotsdean
too
felt
vaguely
that
things
were
approaching
a
crisis
that
a
great
many
resources
had
been
exhausted
that
the
pitcher
which
had
gone
so
often
to
the
well
must
at
last
be
broken
and
that
it
was
as
likely
the
catastrophe
was
coming
now
as
at
any
other
time
he
said
to
himself
that
never
in
his
previous
experience
had
things
seemed
so
blank
as
at
present
never
had
the
moment
of
fate
approached
so
nearly
without
any
appearance
of
deliverance
he
had
not
even
the
round
of
possibilities
before
him
which
were
in
may
mind
however
hopeless
at
this
particular
moment
he
might
find
them
cotsdean
for
his
part
had
nothing
to
think
of
but
may
would
he
find
some
way
out
of
it
still
he
who
was
always
so
clever
and
must
in
his
position
have
always
good
friends
how
the
poor
man
wished
that
he
had
never
been
led
into
this
fatal
course
that
he
had
insisted
long
ago
on
the
settlement
which
must
come
some
time
and
which
did
not
get
any
easier
by
putting
it
off
but
then
who
was
he
to
stand
against
his
clergyman
he
did
not
feel
able
now
to
make
any
stand
against
him
if
he
had
to
be
ruined
he
must
be
ruined
what
could
he
do
the
man
who
had
brought
him
to
this
held
him
in
such
subjection
that
he
could
not
denounce
or
accuse
him
even
now
he
was
so
much
better
higher
abler
stronger
than
himself
that
cotsdean
harshest
sentiment
was
a
dumb
feeling
of
injury
a
feeling
much
more
likely
to
lead
him
to
miserable
tears
than
to
resistance
his
clergyman
how
was
he
to
stand
against
his
clergyman
this
was
the
burden
of
his
thoughts
and
still
perhaps
there
might
be
salvation
and
safety
in
the
resources
the
power
and
cleverness
and
superior
strength
of
the
man
for
whom
in
his
humility
he
had
risked
everything
poor
cotsdean
eyes
were
red
with
sleeplessness
and
thinking
and
the
constant
rubbings
he
administered
with
the
sleeve
of
his
rough
coat
he
hung
helpless
in
suspense
waiting
to
see
what
his
chief
would
say
to
him
if
he
would
send
for
him
if
he
would
come
and
in
the
intervals
of
these
anxious
thoughts
he
asked
himself
should
he
tell
poor
sally
should
he
prepare
her
for
her
fate
she
and
her
children
might
be
turned
out
of
house
and
home
very
probably
would
be
he
said
to
himself
leaping
to
the
extreme
point
as
men
in
his
condition
are
apt
to
do
they
might
take
everything
from
him
they
might
bring
all
his
creditors
on
him
in
a
heap
they
might
sell
him
up
his
shop
by
which
he
made
his
daily
bread
and
everything
he
had
and
turn
his
children
out
into
the
streets
once
more
he
rubbed
his
sleeve
over
his
eyes
which
were
smarting
with
sleeplessness
and
tears
he
turned
over
the
pages
of
the
ledger
mechanically
there
was
no
help
in
it
no
large
debts
owing
to
him
that
could
be
called
in
no
means
of
getting
any
money
and
nothing
could
he
do
but
contemplate
the
miseries
that
might
be
coming
and
wait
wait
wondering
dully
whether
may
was
doing
anything
to
avert
this
ruin
and
whether
at
any
moment
he
might
walk
in
bringing
safety
in
the
very
look
of
his
bold
eyes
cotsdean
was
not
bold
he
was
small
and
weakly
and
nervous
and
trembled
at
a
sharp
voice
he
was
not
a
man
adapted
for
vigorous
struggling
with
the
world
may
could
do
it
in
whose
hands
was
the
final
issue
he
was
a
man
who
was
afraid
of
no
one
and
whose
powers
nobody
could
deny
surely
now
even
at
the
last
moment
he
would
find
help
somehow
it
seemed
profane
to
entertain
a
doubt
that
he
would
be
able
to
do
it
even
at
the
very
last
but
cotsdean
had
a
miserable
morning
he
could
do
nothing
minute
by
minute
hour
by
hour
he
waited
to
be
called
to
the
parsonage
now
and
then
he
went
out
to
the
door
of
his
shop
and
looked
out
wistfully
down
the
street
where
it
ended
in
the
distance
of
grange
lane
was
that
the
maid
from
the
parsonage
coming
up
across
the
road
were
these
the
young
ladies
who
though
they
knew
nothing
about
the
matter
at
issue
very
frequently
brought
a
note
or
message
from
their
father
to
cotsdean
but
he
was
deceived
in
these
guesses
as
well
as
in
so
many
others
all
the
world
seemed
out
of
doors
that
morning
but
nobody
came
the
ruddy
sunshine
shone
full
down
the
street
glorifying
it
with
rays
of
warm
gold
and
tinting
the
mists
and
clouds
which
lurked
in
the
corners
it
had
been
heavy
and
overcast
in
the
morning
but
at
noon
the
clouds
had
cleared
away
and
that
big
red
globe
of
fire
had
risen
majestically
out
of
the
mists
and
everybody
was
out
but
no
one
except
humble
people
in
the
ordinary
way
of
business
came
to
cotsdean
bushels
of
grain
for
chickens
pennyworths
of
canary
seed
oh
did
any
one
think
he
could
pay
a
hundred
pounds
out
of
these
a
hundred
pounds
the
spending
of
which
had
not
been
his
poor
man
which
was
indeed
spent
long
ago
and
represented
luxuries
past
and
over
luxuries
which
were
not
cotsdean
strange
that
a
mere
lump
of
money
should
live
like
this
long
after
it
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
dead
and
spent
and
gone
then
came
the
hour
of
dinner
when
his
sally
called
him
to
the
room
behind
the
shop
from
which
an
odour
of
bacon
and
fine
big
beans
beans
which
were
represented
in
his
shop
in
many
a
sackful
he
went
in
unwillingly
in
obedience
to
her
command
but
feeling
unable
to
eat
soon
left
the
table
sending
the
young
man
to
fill
his
place
with
whose
appetite
no
obstacle
of
care
or
thought
interfered
poor
cotsdean
felt
that
the
smell
of
the
dinner
made
him
sick
though
he
would
have
liked
to
eat
had
he
been
able
the
smell
of
the
bacon
which
he
loved
and
the
sight
of
the
small
children
whom
he
loved
still
better
and
poor
sally
his
wife
still
red
in
the
face
from
dishing
it
up
sally
was
anxious
about
her
husband
want
of
appetite
what
ails
you
john
she
said
pathetically
it
was
as
if
you
were
out
last
night
nor
nothing
o
that
sort
a
man
as
is
sober
like
you
do
ought
to
turn
at
his
dinner
she
was
half
sorry
and
half
aggrieved
poor
woman
feeling
as
if
some
blame
of
her
cookery
must
be
involved
it
the
bile
said
poor
cotsdean
with
that
simplicity
of
statement
which
is
common
in
his
class
do
you
take
on
sally
i
be
a
deal
better
by
or
worse
he
added
to
himself
yes
he
would
make
an
effort
to
eat
at
perhaps
it
might
be
the
last
meal
he
should
eat
in
his
own
comfortable
home
he
had
been
out
at
the
shop
door
gazing
despairingly
down
the
road
he
had
come
in
and
sold
some
birdseed
wondering
oh
what
good
would
that
penny
do
him
he
who
wanted
a
hundred
pounds
and
was
standing
listening
with
a
sad
heart
to
the
sound
of
the
knives
and
forks
and
chatter
of
the
children
when
suddenly
all
at
once
may
walked
into
the
shop
changing
dismay
into
hope
what
a
thing
it
was
to
be
a
gentleman
and
a
clergyman
cotsdean
could
not
but
think
the
very
sight
of
may
inspired
him
with
courage
even
though
probably
he
had
no
money
in
his
pocket
it
was
a
supporting
thing
only
to
see
him
and
hear
the
sound
of
his
free
unrestrained
step
he
came
in
with
a
friendly
nod
to
his
humble
helper
then
he
glanced
round
the
shop
to
see
that
no
one
was
present
and
then
he
said
all
right
cotsdean
in
a
voice
that
was
as
music
to
the
little
ears
his
heart
which
had
been
beating
so
low
jumped
up
in
his
bosom
his
appetite
came
back
with
a
leap
he
asked
himself
would
the
bacon
be
cold
and
cried
god
be
praised
sir
in
a
breath
may
winced
slightly
but
why
should
it
be
wrong
to
be
grateful
to
god
in
any
circumstances
he
asked
himself
having
become
already
somewhat
composed
in
his
ideas
on
this
particular
point
are
we
quite
alone
he
said
nobody
within
hearing
i
have
not
brought
you
the
money
but
a
piece
of
paper
that
is
as
good
as
the
money
take
it
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
discounting
this
the
man
is
as
well
known
as
the
carlingford
bank
and
as
safe
though
i
dare
say
you
will
be
surprised
at
the
name
cotsdean
opened
out
the
new
bill
with
trembling
hands
tozer
he
said
faintly
between
relief
and
dismay
yes
you
must
know
that
i
am
taking
a
pupil
one
who
belongs
to
a
very
rich
dissenting
family
in
london
tozer
knows
something
about
him
from
his
connection
with
the
body
and
through
this
young
man
i
have
got
to
know
something
of
he
does
it
upon
the
admirable
security
of
the
fees
i
am
to
receive
with
this
youth
so
you
see
after
all
there
is
no
mystery
about
it
better
not
wait
for
cotsdean
go
at
once
and
get
it
settled
you
see
said
may
ingratiatingly
it
is
a
little
larger
than
the
other
one
hundred
and
fifty
indeed
but
that
does
not
matter
with
such
an
excellent
name
tozer
said
cotsdean
once
more
bewildered
he
handled
the
piece
of
paper
nervously
and
turned
it
upside
down
and
round
about
with
a
sense
that
it
might
melt
in
his
hold
he
did
not
like
the
additional
fifty
added
why
should
another
fifty
be
added
but
so
it
was
and
there
seemed
nothing
for
him
but
to
take
the
immediate
relief
and
be
thankful
i
rather
sir
as
tozer
had
known
nothing
about
it
and
why
should
he
back
a
bill
for
me
as
ai
one
of
my
friends
nor
do
know
nothing
about
me
and
fifty
more
added
on
said
cotsdean
it
was
the
nearest
he
had
gone
to
standing
up
against
his
clergyman
he
did
not
like
it
to
be
may
sole
and
agent
even
at
periodical
risk
of
ruin
was
possible
to
him
but
a
pang
of
jealousy
alarm
and
pain
came
into
his
mind
when
he
saw
the
new
name
this
even
obliterated
the
immediate
sense
of
relief
that
was
in
his
mind
come
three
months
it
have
to
be
paid
said
cotsdean
and
tozer
ai
a
man
to
stand
it
if
he
left
to
pay
he
sell
us
up
may
he
ai
one
of
the
patient
ones
like
some
other
folks
and
fifty
pounds
put
on
i
do
see
my
way
to
it
i
rather
it
was
just
the
clear
hundred
if
it
was
the
same
to
you
it
is
not
the
same
to
me
said
may
calmly
come
there
is
no
cause
to
make
any
fuss
there
it
is
and
if
you
do
like
to
make
use
of
it
you
must
find
some
better
way
bring
the
fifty
pounds
less
the
expenses
to
me
it
is
a
good
bit
of
paper
and
it
delivers
us
out
of
a
mess
which
i
hope
we
shall
not
fall
into
again
so
you
said
before
sir
said
the
sullenly
cotsdean
you
forget
yourself
but
i
can
make
allowance
for
your
anxiety
take
it
and
get
it
settled
before
the
bank
closes
pay
in
the
money
to
meet
the
other
bill
and
bring
me
the
balance
you
will
find
no
difficulty
with
tozer
name
and
what
so
likely
as
that
one
respectable
tradesman
should
help
another
by
the
way
the
affair
is
a
private
one
between
us
and
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
anything
to
him
about
it
the
arrangement
you
understand
is
between
him
and
me
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
cotsdean
with
a
deprecatory
movement
of
his
hand
to
his
forehead
but
it
is
me
as
will
be
come
upon
first
if
anything
happens
and
that
fifty
pounds
have
you
ever
found
me
to
fail
you
cotsdean
if
you
knew
the
anxiety
i
have
gone
through
that
you
might
be
kept
from
harm
the
sleepless
nights
the
schemes
the
exertions
you
may
suppose
it
was
no
ordinary
effort
to
ask
a
man
like
tozer
cotsdean
was
moved
by
the
touching
tone
in
which
his
partner
in
trouble
spoke
but
terror
gave
him
a
certain
power
he
grumbled
still
not
altogether
vanquished
i
do
say
nothing
against
that
sir
he
said
not
meeting
eye
but
when
it
comes
to
be
paid
sir
i
the
first
in
it
and
where
is
that
other
fifty
to
come
from
that
what
i
a
thinking
for
for
i
the
first
as
they
haul
up
after
all
you
said
may
what
could
they
get
from
you
you
are
not
worth
powder
and
shot
do
be
ridiculous
my
good
fellow
i
never
avoid
my
responsibilities
as
you
know
i
am
as
good
i
hope
for
that
fifty
as
for
all
that
went
before
have
you
ever
known
me
leave
you
or
any
one
in
the
lurch
no
sir
i
ca
say
as
i
do
suppose
i
have
i
always
put
my
trust
in
you
like
in
providence
itself
he
cried
hastily
holding
his
breath
then
do
as
i
tell
you
said
may
waving
his
hand
with
careless
superiority
and
though
his
heart
was
aching
with
a
hundred
anxious
fears
he
left
the
shop
with
just
that
mixture
of
partial
offence
and
indifference
which
overawed
completely
his
humble
retainer
cotsdean
trembled
at
his
own
guilty
folly
and
temerity
he
did
not
dare
to
call
his
patron
back
again
to
ask
his
pardon
he
did
not
venture
to
go
back
to
the
table
and
snatch
a
bit
of
cold
bacon
he
was
afraid
he
had
offended
his
clergyman
what
matter
that
he
was
hungry
for
his
dinner
he
called
the
young
man
from
the
bacon
which
was
now
cold
and
all
but
eaten
up
and
snatched
at
his
hat
and
went
out
to
the
bank
it
was
all
he
could
do
chapter
xxiv
a
visit
dear
may
young
copperhead
the
young
fellow
whom
you
have
undertaken
to
coach
is
coming
to
the
hall
for
a
few
days
before
he
enters
upon
his
studies
and
anne
wishes
me
to
ask
you
to
come
over
on
tuesday
to
dine
and
sleep
and
to
make
acquaintance
with
him
you
can
carry
him
back
with
you
if
it
suits
you
in
my
private
opinion
he
is
a
cub
of
the
most
disagreeable
kind
but
the
girls
like
his
mother
who
is
a
kind
of
cousin
as
you
know
it
is
not
only
because
he
has
failed
to
take
his
degree
you
know
how
i
hate
the
hideous
slang
in
which
this
fact
is
generally
stated
but
that
his
father
who
is
one
of
the
rich
persons
who
abound
in
the
lower
circles
of
society
is
ambitious
and
would
like
to
see
him
in
parliament
and
that
sort
of
thing
a
position
which
can
not
be
held
creditably
without
some
sort
of
education
at
least
so
i
am
myself
disposed
to
think
therefore
your
pleasing
duty
will
be
to
get
him
up
in
a
little
history
and
geography
so
that
he
may
not
get
quite
hopelessly
wrong
in
any
of
the
modern
modifications
of
territory
for
instance
and
in
so
much
horace
as
may
furnish
him
with
a
few
stock
quotations
in
case
he
should
be
called
upon
in
the
absence
of
any
more
hopeful
neophyte
to
move
the
address
he
is
a
great
hulking
fellow
not
very
brilliant
you
may
suppose
but
not
so
badly
mannered
as
he
might
be
considering
his
parentage
i
do
think
he
give
you
much
trouble
in
the
house
but
he
will
most
probably
bore
you
to
death
and
in
that
case
your
family
ought
to
have
a
claim
i
should
think
for
compensation
anyhow
come
and
see
him
and
us
before
you
begin
your
hard
task
very
truly
yours
r
dorset
anne
makes
me
open
my
letter
to
say
that
ursula
must
come
too
we
will
send
a
carriage
to
meet
you
at
the
station
this
letter
caused
considerable
excitement
in
the
parsonage
it
was
the
first
invitation
to
dinner
which
ursula
had
ever
received
the
in
carlingford
were
little
frequented
by
young
ladies
the
male
population
was
not
large
enough
to
afford
a
balance
for
the
young
women
of
the
place
who
came
together
in
the
evening
and
took
all
the
trouble
of
putting
on
their
pretty
white
frocks
only
to
sit
in
rows
in
the
waiting
till
the
old
gentlemen
came
in
from
the
after
which
everybody
went
away
there
were
no
young
gentlemen
to
speak
of
in
carlingford
so
that
when
any
one
was
bold
enough
to
attempt
a
or
anything
of
an
equally
amusing
description
friends
were
sent
out
in
all
directions
as
the
beaters
are
sent
into
the
woods
to
bring
together
the
unfortunate
birds
for
a
to
find
men
these
circumstances
will
explain
the
flutter
in
ursula
innocent
bosom
when
her
father
read
her
that
postscript
may
was
singularly
amiable
that
day
a
thing
which
happened
at
periodical
intervals
usually
after
he
had
been
specially
cross
on
this
occasion
there
was
no
black
mark
against
him
in
the
family
reckoning
and
yet
he
was
more
kind
than
any
one
had
ever
known
him
instead
of
making
any
objections
he
decided
at
once
that
ursula
must
go
and
told
her
to
put
on
her
prettiest
frock
and
make
herself
look
very
nice
you
must
let
anne
dorset
see
that
you
care
to
please
her
he
said
anne
is
a
very
good
woman
and
her
approval
is
worth
having
oh
papa
cried
janey
when
you
are
always
calling
her
an
old
maid
pas
he
said
which
puzzled
janey
whose
french
was
very
deficient
even
ursula
supposed
to
be
the
best
french
scholar
in
the
family
was
not
quite
sure
what
it
meant
but
it
was
evidently
something
in
favour
of
cousin
anne
which
was
sweet
to
the
grateful
girl
janey
though
suffering
bitterly
under
the
miserable
consciousness
of
being
only
fourteen
and
not
asked
anywhere
helped
with
disinterested
zeal
to
get
her
sister
ready
and
consoled
herself
by
orders
for
unlimited
muffins
and
cake
for
tea
there
will
only
be
the
children
she
said
resignedly
and
felt
herself
but
indeed
the
attractions
of
a
good
romp
afterwards
no
one
being
in
the
house
to
restrain
the
spirits
of
the
youthful
party
made
even
janey
amends
as
for
reginald
who
was
not
asked
he
was
it
must
be
allowed
rather
sulky
too
and
he
could
not
solace
himself
either
with
muffins
or
romps
his
rooms
at
the
college
were
very
pleasant
rooms
but
he
was
used
to
home
and
though
the
home
at
the
parsonage
was
but
faded
and
not
in
such
perfect
order
as
it
might
have
been
the
young
man
felt
even
his
wainscoted
study
dull
without
the
familiar
voices
the
laughter
and
foolish
family
jokes
and
even
the
little
quarrels
which
kept
life
always
astir
he
walked
with
ursula
to
the
station
whither
her
little
box
with
her
evening
dress
had
gone
before
her
in
a
state
of
mind
what
does
he
want
with
a
pupil
reginald
was
saying
as
he
had
said
before
a
fellow
no
one
knows
coming
and
taking
possession
of
the
house
as
if
it
belonged
to
him
there
is
plenty
to
do
in
the
parish
without
pupils
and
if
i
were
not
on
the
spot
he
would
get
into
trouble
i
can
tell
you
a
man
that
has
been
ploughed
big
hulking
sir
robert
says
so
not
i
mind
i
have
no
flirting
ursula
that
is
what
always
happens
with
a
pupil
in
the
house
reginald
how
dare
you
oh
yes
i
dare
my
courage
is
quite
equal
to
facing
you
even
if
you
do
shoot
thunderbolts
out
of
your
eyes
mind
you
i
wo
have
it
there
is
a
set
of
fellows
who
try
it
regularly
and
if
you
were
above
them
would
go
in
for
janey
and
it
would
be
great
fun
and
great
promotion
for
janey
she
would
feel
herself
a
woman
directly
so
you
must
mind
her
as
well
as
yourself
i
do
like
it
at
all
reginald
went
on
probably
he
will
complain
of
the
dinners
you
give
him
as
if
he
were
in
an
inn
confound
him
what
my
father
means
by
it
i
ca
tell
reginald
you
ought
not
to
swear
said
ursula
it
is
dreadfully
wicked
in
a
clergyman
poor
papa
meant
making
a
little
more
money
what
else
could
he
mean
and
i
think
it
is
very
good
of
him
for
it
will
bother
him
most
copperhead
is
very
nice
reginald
i
saw
him
in
london
you
know
i
thought
he
was
very
ah
oh
said
reginald
i
forgot
that
you
met
him
in
london
to
be
sure
and
it
was
there
you
met
miss
beecham
i
begin
to
see
is
he
coming
here
after
her
i
should
like
to
know
she
does
look
the
sort
of
girl
to
encourage
that
sort
of
thing
the
sort
of
girl
to
encourage
that
sort
of
thing
how
strangely
you
talk
when
you
get
excited
is
that
rather
vulgar
i
do
know
if
he
is
coming
after
miss
beecham
or
not
said
ursula
who
thought
the
suggestion
uncalled
for
but
in
a
very
short
time
you
can
judge
for
yourself
ah
indignation
said
the
big
brother
who
like
most
big
brothers
laughed
at
ursula
exhibition
of
offended
dignity
and
by
the
way
miss
beecham
you
have
not
seen
her
since
that
night
when
she
was
sent
for
will
not
she
think
it
strange
that
you
never
sent
to
inquire
i
sent
betsey
but
if
miss
beecham
had
been
somebody
else
you
would
have
gone
yourself
he
said
being
in
a
humour
for
finding
fault
if
poor
old
tozer
had
been
what
you
call
a
lady
i
thought
you
were
much
more
strong
than
i
am
against
the
dissenters
said
ursula
ever
since
that
man
speech
and
indeed
always
as
long
as
i
can
recollect
she
is
not
a
mere
dissenter
said
reginald
i
think
i
shall
call
as
i
go
home
she
is
the
cleverest
girl
i
ever
met
not
like
one
of
you
girls
though
she
is
not
much
older
than
you
a
man
finds
a
girl
like
that
worth
talking
to
said
the
young
clergyman
holding
himself
erect
certainly
reginald
had
not
improved
he
had
grown
ever
so
much
more
since
he
got
a
living
of
his
own
and
if
i
was
to
say
i
wo
have
it
reginald
cried
ursula
i
think
that
is
a
great
deal
worse
than
a
pupil
but
miss
beecham
is
very
dignified
and
you
may
be
sure
she
will
not
think
much
of
a
call
from
you
heaven
be
praised
that
is
one
thing
you
ca
get
into
your
hands
we
girls
are
always
good
for
something
there
men
may
think
themselves
as
grand
as
they
please
said
ursula
but
their
visits
are
of
no
consequence
it
is
ladies
of
the
family
who
must
after
this
little
she
came
down
at
once
to
her
usual
calm
i
will
ask
cousin
anne
what
i
ought
to
do
i
do
think
miss
beecham
wanted
me
to
go
then
i
shall
go
said
reginald
and
he
left
ursula
in
her
father
keeping
who
met
them
at
the
station
and
went
off
at
once
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
having
piqued
her
curiosity
to
grange
lane
it
was
still
early
for
the
trains
which
stopped
at
the
little
country
station
next
to
the
hall
were
very
few
and
inconvenient
and
the
sun
though
setting
was
still
shining
red
from
over
roque
upon
grange
lane
the
old
red
walls
grew
redder
still
in
the
frosty
night
and
the
sky
began
to
bloom
into
great
blazing
patches
of
colour
upon
the
wintry
clearness
of
the
blue
there
was
going
to
be
a
beautiful
sunset
and
such
a
thing
was
always
to
be
seen
from
grange
lane
better
than
anywhere
else
in
carlingford
reginald
went
down
the
road
slowly
looking
at
it
and
already
almost
forgetting
his
idea
of
calling
on
miss
beecham
to
call
on
miss
beecham
would
be
to
call
on
old
tozer
the
butterman
to
whom
alone
the
visit
would
be
naturally
paid
and
this
made
him
laugh
within
himself
so
he
would
have
passed
no
doubt
without
the
least
attempt
at
intruding
on
the
privacy
of
the
tozers
had
not
the
opened
before
he
got
so
far
and
phoebe
herself
came
out
with
her
hands
in
her
muff
to
take
a
little
walk
up
and
down
as
she
did
daily
she
did
not
take
her
hand
out
of
its
warm
enclosure
to
give
it
to
him
but
nodded
with
friendly
ease
in
return
to
his
salutation
i
have
come
out
to
see
the
sunset
said
phoebe
i
like
a
little
air
before
the
day
is
over
and
grandmamma
when
she
is
poorly
likes
her
room
to
be
very
warm
i
hope
tozer
is
better
i
hope
you
have
not
been
anxious
oh
no
it
is
chronic
there
is
no
danger
but
she
requires
a
great
deal
of
attendance
and
i
like
to
come
out
when
i
can
oh
how
fine
it
is
what
colour
i
think
may
you
must
have
a
for
sunsets
at
carlingford
i
never
saw
them
so
beautiful
anywhere
else
i
am
glad
there
is
something
you
like
in
carlingford
something
there
is
a
very
great
deal
and
that
i
do
like
too
she
said
with
a
smile
i
do
care
for
the
people
i
am
living
among
which
is
dreadful
i
do
suppose
you
have
ever
had
such
an
experience
though
you
must
know
a
great
deal
more
in
other
ways
than
i
all
the
people
that
come
to
inquire
about
grandmamma
are
very
kind
they
are
as
good
as
possible
i
respect
them
and
all
that
but
well
it
must
be
my
own
fault
or
education
it
is
education
no
doubt
that
gives
us
those
absurd
ideas
do
call
them
absurd
said
reginald
indeed
i
can
enter
into
them
perfectly
well
i
do
them
perhaps
in
my
own
person
but
i
can
perfectly
understand
the
repugnance
the
distress
the
words
are
too
strong
said
phoebe
not
so
much
as
that
the
annoyance
perhaps
the
nasty
disagreeable
struggle
with
one
self
and
one
pride
as
if
one
were
better
than
other
people
i
dislike
myself
and
despise
myself
for
it
but
i
ca
help
it
we
have
so
little
power
over
ourselves
i
hope
you
will
let
my
sister
do
what
she
can
to
deliver
you
said
reginald
ursula
is
not
like
you
but
she
is
a
good
little
thing
and
she
is
able
to
appreciate
you
i
was
to
tell
you
she
had
been
called
suddenly
off
to
the
dorsets
with
whom
my
father
and
she
have
gone
to
pass
the
night
to
meet
i
believe
a
person
you
know
oh
clarence
copperhead
he
is
come
then
how
odd
it
will
be
to
see
him
here
his
mother
is
nice
but
his
father
is
oh
may
if
you
only
knew
the
things
people
have
to
put
up
with
when
i
think
of
copperhead
and
his
great
ugly
staring
wealth
i
feel
disposed
to
hate
money
especially
among
dissenters
it
would
be
better
if
we
were
all
poor
reginald
said
nothing
he
thought
so
too
in
that
case
there
would
be
a
few
disagreeable
things
out
of
a
poor
clergyman
way
and
assaults
like
that
of
northcote
upon
himself
would
be
impossible
but
he
could
scarcely
utter
these
virtuous
sentiments
poverty
is
the
desire
of
ascetics
and
this
is
not
an
ascetic
age
he
said
at
length
with
a
at
himself
for
his
stiff
speech
you
may
say
it
is
not
an
ascetic
age
but
yet
i
suppose
the
ritualists
perhaps
you
are
a
ritualist
yourself
may
i
know
as
little
personally
about
the
church
here
as
you
do
about
salem
chapel
i
like
the
service
so
does
papa
and
i
like
above
all
things
the
independent
standing
of
a
clergyman
the
feeling
he
must
have
that
he
is
free
to
do
his
duty
that
is
why
i
like
the
church
for
other
things
of
course
i
like
our
own
body
best
i
do
suppose
such
things
can
be
argued
about
miss
beecham
i
wish
i
knew
something
of
my
father
new
pupil
i
do
like
having
a
stranger
in
the
house
my
father
is
fond
of
having
his
own
way
it
is
astonishing
how
often
parents
are
so
said
phoebe
demurely
and
the
way
they
talk
of
their
experience
as
if
each
new
generation
did
not
know
more
than
the
one
that
preceded
it
you
are
pleased
to
laugh
but
i
am
quite
in
earnest
a
pupil
is
a
nuisance
for
instance
no
man
who
has
a
family
should
ever
take
one
i
know
what
things
are
said
you
mean
about
the
daughters
that
is
true
enough
there
are
always
difficulties
in
the
way
but
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
clarence
copperhead
he
is
not
the
fascinating
pupil
of
a
nothing
the
least
like
the
heir
of
redclyffe
about
him
you
are
very
well
up
in
miss
yonge
novels
miss
beecham
yes
said
phoebe
one
reads
scott
for
scotland
and
a
few
other
things
and
one
reads
miss
yonge
for
the
church
trollope
is
good
for
that
too
but
not
so
good
all
that
i
know
of
clergymen
families
i
have
got
from
her
i
can
recognize
you
quite
well
and
your
sister
but
the
younger
ones
puzzle
me
they
are
not
in
miss
yonge
they
are
too
much
like
other
children
too
naughty
i
do
mean
anything
disagreeable
the
babies
in
miss
yonge
are
often
very
naughty
too
but
not
the
same
as
for
you
may
yes
as
for
me
oh
i
know
everything
about
you
you
are
a
fine
scholar
but
you
like
the
drudgery
of
teaching
you
have
a
fine
mind
but
it
interferes
with
you
continually
you
have
had
a
few
doubts
just
enough
to
give
a
piquancy
and
now
you
have
a
great
ideal
and
mean
to
do
many
things
that
common
clergymen
do
think
of
that
was
why
you
hesitated
about
the
chaplaincy
see
how
much
i
have
got
out
of
miss
yonge
i
know
you
as
well
as
if
i
had
known
you
all
my
life
a
great
deal
better
than
i
know
clarence
copperhead
but
then
no
person
of
genius
has
taken
any
trouble
about
him
i
did
not
know
i
had
been
a
hero
of
fiction
said
reginald
who
had
a
great
mind
to
be
angry
all
this
time
they
were
walking
briskly
backward
and
forward
before
tozer
open
door
the
anglican
in
his
long
black
coat
following
the
lively
movements
of
tozer
granddaughter
only
because
he
could
not
help
himself
he
was
irritated
yet
he
was
pleased
a
young
man
is
pleased
to
be
thought
of
even
when
the
notice
is
but
barely
complimentary
phoebe
must
have
thought
of
him
a
good
deal
before
she
found
him
out
in
this
way
but
he
was
irritated
all
the
same
you
are
however
she
answered
lightly
look
at
that
blaze
of
crimson
may
and
the
blue
which
is
so
clear
and
so
unfathomable
winter
is
grander
than
summer
and
even
warmer
to
look
at
with
its
orange
and
purple
and
gold
what
poor
little
dirty
dingy
things
we
are
down
here
to
have
all
this
exhibited
every
evening
for
our
delight
that
is
true
he
said
and
as
he
gazed
something
woke
in
the
young
man
heart
a
little
thrill
of
fancy
if
not
of
love
it
is
hard
to
look
at
a
beautiful
sunset
and
then
see
it
reflected
in
a
girl
face
and
not
to
feel
something
which
may
be
nothing
perhaps
his
heart
gave
a
small
jump
not
much
to
speak
of
phoebe
did
not
talk
like
the
other
young
ladies
in
grange
lane
may
mr
may
she
cried
suddenly
please
go
away
i
foresee
a
disastrous
encounter
which
alarms
me
you
ca
fight
but
there
is
no
saying
what
you
might
do
to
each
other
please
go
away
what
is
the
matter
he
said
i
do
understand
any
encounter
being
disastrous
here
why
should
i
go
away
she
laughed
but
there
was
a
certain
fright
in
her
tone
please
she
said
i
see
northcote
coming
this
way
he
will
stop
to
speak
to
me
it
is
the
gentleman
who
attacked
you
in
the
meeting
may
she
added
entreatingly
between
laughter
and
fright
do
go
please
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
reginald
roused
i
am
not
afraid
let
him
come
on
this
wall
shall
fly
from
its
firm
base
as
soon
as
i
phoebe
clasped
her
hands
in
dismay
which
was
partially
real
the
typical
churchman
she
said
with
a
glance
at
reginald
figure
which
was
not
displeasing
to
him
and
the
typical
dissenter
and
what
am
i
to
do
between
them
oh
i
wish
you
would
go
away
not
an
inch
said
the
young
champion
phoebe
was
frightened
but
she
was
delighted
i
shall
introduce
him
to
you
she
said
threatening
i
do
mind
he
replied
nothing
on
earth
should
induce
me
to
fly
chapter
xxv
tea
now
here
was
a
business
the
typical
anglican
and
the
typical
dissenter
as
phoebe
said
with
only
that
clever
young
woman
to
keep
them
from
flying
at
each
other
throats
the
one
obstinately
holding
his
place
by
her
side
and
phoebe
began
to
have
a
slight
consciousness
that
being
without
any
chaperon
she
ought
not
to
have
kept
reginald
may
at
her
side
but
in
the
tozer
world
who
knew
anything
of
chaperons
the
other
advancing
steadily
coming
up
the
lane
out
of
the
glow
of
the
sunset
showing
square
against
it
in
his
and
high
hat
formal
and
demagogical
not
like
his
rival
the
situation
pleased
phoebe
who
liked
to
manage
but
it
slightly
frightened
her
as
well
though
the
open
door
behind
and
the
long
garden
with
its
clouds
of
crocuses
was
a
city
of
refuge
always
within
reach
is
it
really
you
mr
northcote
she
said
you
look
as
if
you
had
dropped
out
of
that
lovely
sunset
i
have
been
watching
so
long
and
i
thought
you
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
i
have
been
at
the
other
end
of
england
which
comes
to
the
same
thing
said
northcote
in
a
voice
which
was
harsh
by
nature
and
somewhat
rough
with
cold
and
now
they
have
sent
me
back
to
salem
chapel
to
take
thorpe
place
for
three
months
they
asked
for
me
i
believe
but
that
you
must
know
better
than
i
do
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
man
not
to
be
a
little
proud
in
the
circumstances
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
he
considered
phoebe
to
have
something
to
do
with
the
flattering
request
no
i
have
not
heard
but
i
am
glad
said
phoebe
and
if
it
is
not
wicked
to
say
so
i
am
glad
thorpe
is
to
be
away
let
us
hope
it
will
do
him
good
i
am
sure
it
will
do
the
rest
of
us
good
at
all
events
northcote
made
no
answer
but
he
looked
at
the
other
and
several
questions
began
to
tremble
on
his
lips
that
this
was
a
churchman
did
not
immediately
occur
to
him
for
indeed
various
young
pastors
of
his
own
body
put
on
the
livery
which
he
himself
abjured
and
the
sight
of
it
as
a
servile
copy
filled
him
with
a
certain
contempt
may
has
been
stopped
in
his
way
by
the
beauty
of
the
skies
said
phoebe
rather
enjoying
the
position
as
she
got
used
to
it
northcote
may
it
is
not
easy
to
pass
such
an
exhibition
as
that
is
it
and
given
to
us
all
for
love
and
nothing
for
reward
she
added
for
she
was
a
well
read
young
woman
and
did
not
hesitate
to
suffer
this
to
appear
and
then
there
was
a
momentary
pause
northcote
was
confused
it
must
be
allowed
by
thus
coming
face
to
face
without
previous
warning
with
the
man
whom
he
had
so
violently
assailed
reginald
had
the
best
of
it
in
every
way
for
he
was
the
man
injured
and
had
it
in
his
power
to
be
magnanimous
and
he
had
the
advantage
of
full
warning
and
had
prepared
himself
besides
was
not
he
the
superior
by
every
social
rule
and
that
consciousness
is
always
sweet
if
northcote
is
new
to
carlingford
he
will
probably
not
know
what
a
fine
point
of
view
we
have
here
that
like
so
many
other
things
said
reginald
pointedly
wants
a
little
personal
experience
to
find
it
out
for
that
matter
to
see
it
once
is
as
good
as
seeing
it
a
hundred
times
said
northcote
somewhat
sharply
for
to
give
in
was
the
very
last
thing
he
thought
of
a
little
glow
of
anger
came
over
him
he
thought
phoebe
had
prepared
this
ordeal
for
him
and
he
was
vexed
not
only
because
she
had
done
it
but
because
his
sense
of
discomfiture
might
afford
a
kind
of
triumph
to
that
party
in
the
connection
which
was
disposed
as
he
expressed
it
to
toady
the
church
pardon
me
i
do
think
you
can
judge
of
anything
at
a
first
view
and
pardon
me
i
think
you
see
everything
most
sharply
and
clearly
at
a
first
view
said
the
nonconformist
who
was
the
loudest
certainly
in
all
matters
of
principle
after
a
while
you
are
persuaded
against
your
will
to
modify
this
opinion
and
that
to
pare
off
a
little
here
and
tolerate
a
little
there
your
first
view
is
the
most
correct
well
said
phoebe
throwing
herself
into
the
breach
i
am
glad
you
do
agree
for
the
argument
is
interesting
will
you
come
in
and
fight
it
out
you
shall
have
some
tea
which
will
be
pleasant
for
it
shall
be
hot
i
really
can
not
stay
out
any
longer
it
is
freezing
here
the
prepared
to
follow
but
reginald
hesitated
pride
whispered
that
to
go
into
the
house
of
tozer
the
butterman
was
something
monstrous
but
then
it
might
be
amusing
this
dissenting
fellow
no
doubt
was
a
drawback
but
a
kind
of
angry
antagonism
and
disdain
him
even
to
the
dissenting
fellow
it
might
be
well
on
the
whole
to
see
what
kind
of
being
such
a
person
was
all
curious
phenomena
are
attractive
to
a
student
the
proper
study
of
mankind
is
man
reginald
said
to
himself
before
he
had
got
through
this
little
argument
with
himself
phoebe
had
gone
in
and
northcote
whose
disgust
at
the
interposition
of
an
adversary
had
no
such
softening
of
curiosity
followed
her
abruptly
without
any
of
those
graces
which
are
current
in
society
this
rudeness
offended
the
other
who
was
about
to
walk
on
indignant
when
phoebe
turned
back
and
looked
out
at
him
from
the
open
door
are
not
you
coming
mr
may
she
said
softly
looking
at
him
with
the
least
little
shrug
of
her
shoulders
reginald
yielded
without
further
resistance
but
he
felt
fully
that
to
see
him
the
chaplain
of
the
old
college
walking
down
through
garden
between
the
two
rows
of
crocuses
which
glimmered
ghostly
by
the
side
of
the
path
was
one
of
the
strangest
sights
in
the
world
phoebe
to
tell
the
truth
was
a
little
confused
as
to
where
to
convey
her
captive
out
of
whom
she
meant
to
get
a
little
amusement
for
the
long
winter
afternoon
for
a
girl
of
her
active
mind
it
may
easily
be
imagined
that
a
succession
of
long
days
with
tozer
was
somewhat
monotonous
she
did
her
duty
like
a
hero
and
never
complained
but
still
if
a
little
amusement
was
possible
it
was
worth
having
she
carried
in
her
two
young
men
as
naughty
boys
carry
or
other
such
small
deer
if
they
would
fight
it
would
be
fun
and
if
they
would
not
fight
why
it
might
be
fun
still
and
more
amusing
than
grandmamma
she
hesitated
between
the
chilly
where
a
fire
was
lighted
but
where
there
was
no
evidence
of
human
living
and
the
cozy
parlour
where
tozer
sat
in
her
best
cap
still
wheezy
but
convalescent
waiting
for
her
tea
and
not
indisposed
to
receive
such
deputations
of
the
community
as
might
come
to
ask
for
her
finally
phoebe
opened
the
door
of
that
sanctuary
which
was
dazzling
with
bright
after
the
gloom
outside
it
was
a
very
comfortable
interior
arranged
by
phoebe
to
suit
her
own
ideas
rather
than
those
of
grandmamma
though
grandmamma
comfort
had
been
her
chief
object
the
were
sparkling
upon
the
table
the
kettle
singing
by
the
fire
and
tozer
in
the
tranquillity
and
warmth
grandmamma
i
have
brought
may
and
northcote
to
see
you
she
said
the
poor
old
lady
almost
sprang
from
her
chair
in
amazement
lord
bless
us
phoebe
mr
may
do
disturb
yourself
grandmamma
they
will
find
seats
yes
we
were
all
looking
at
the
sunset
and
as
i
knew
tea
must
be
ready
i
know
you
want
it
dear
granny
i
asked
them
to
have
some
here
it
is
as
i
told
you
quite
hot
and
very
fragrant
this
cold
night
how
cold
it
is
outside
i
think
it
will
freeze
and
that
skating
may
come
off
at
last
may
that
you
were
talking
of
you
remember
you
were
to
teach
your
sisters
to
skate
yes
with
the
advantage
of
your
example
reginald
had
put
himself
in
a
corner
as
far
away
as
possible
from
the
old
woman
in
the
chair
his
voice
he
felt
had
caught
a
formal
tone
as
for
the
other
his
antagonist
he
had
assumed
the
front
of
the
battle
even
in
tozer
absence
he
had
ventured
to
assume
the
front
of
the
fire
he
was
not
the
sort
of
man
reginald
had
expected
almost
hoped
to
see
a
fleshy
man
loosely
put
together
according
to
the
nature
so
far
as
he
knew
it
of
dissenters
but
a
firmly
knit
young
man
with
crisp
hair
curling
about
his
head
and
a
gleam
of
energy
and
spirit
in
his
eye
the
gentler
anglican
felt
by
no
means
sure
of
a
speedy
victory
even
of
an
intellectual
kind
the
young
man
before
him
did
not
look
a
slight
antagonist
they
glared
at
each
other
measuring
their
strength
they
did
not
know
indeed
that
they
had
been
brought
in
here
to
this
warmth
and
light
like
the
to
make
a
little
amusement
for
phoebe
but
they
were
quite
ready
to
fight
all
the
same
northcote
sir
i
glad
to
see
you
now
this
is
friendly
this
is
what
i
calls
as
it
should
be
when
a
young
pastor
comes
in
and
makes
free
without
waiting
for
an
invitation
said
tozer
kindly
bustling
in
that
speech
of
yours
sir
was
a
rouser
that
off
that
did
and
you
can
see
as
the
connection
ai
ungrateful
what
that
you
say
phoebe
what
i
a
little
hard
of
hearing
may
may
was
good
enough
to
come
in
with
me
grandpapa
we
met
at
the
door
we
have
mutual
friends
and
you
know
how
kind
miss
may
has
been
said
phoebe
trembling
with
sudden
fright
while
reginald
pale
with
rage
and
embarrassment
stood
up
in
his
corner
tozer
was
embarrassed
too
he
cleared
his
throat
and
rubbed
his
hands
with
a
terrible
inclination
to
raise
one
of
them
to
his
forehead
it
was
all
that
he
could
do
to
get
over
this
class
instinct
young
may
though
he
had
been
delighted
to
hear
him
assailed
in
the
meeting
was
a
totally
different
visitor
from
the
clever
young
pastor
whom
he
received
with
a
certain
consciousness
of
patronage
tozer
did
not
know
that
the
northcotes
were
infinitely
richer
and
quite
as
and
in
their
ways
as
the
mays
and
that
his
young
dissenting
brother
was
a
more
costly
production
as
well
as
a
more
wealthy
man
than
the
young
chaplain
in
his
long
coat
but
if
he
had
known
this
it
would
have
made
no
difference
his
relation
to
the
one
was
to
the
other
condescending
and
superior
in
reginald
may
presence
he
was
but
a
butterman
who
supplied
the
family
but
to
horace
northcote
he
was
an
influential
member
of
society
with
power
over
a
minister
individual
fate
i
assure
you
sir
as
i
proud
to
see
you
in
my
house
he
said
with
a
duck
of
his
head
and
an
ingratiating
but
uncomfortable
smile
your
father
i
hope
as
he
well
sir
and
all
the
family
we
are
a
kind
of
neighbours
now
not
as
we
think
of
taking
anything
upon
us
on
account
of
living
in
grange
lane
but
phoebe
here
phoebe
junior
as
we
her
she
a
cut
above
us
and
i
proud
to
see
any
of
her
friends
in
my
my
good
lady
sir
added
tozer
with
another
duck
indicating
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
his
wife
who
had
already
once
risen
wheezy
but
knowing
her
manners
to
make
a
kind
of
from
her
chair
you
are
very
kind
said
reginald
feeling
himself
blush
furiously
and
not
knowing
what
to
say
the
other
young
man
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
a
sneer
which
he
intended
to
look
like
a
smile
on
his
face
and
as
for
phoebe
it
must
be
allowed
that
notwithstanding
all
her
resources
even
she
was
exquisitely
uncomfortable
for
a
minute
or
two
the
young
people
all
felt
this
but
to
tozer
it
seemed
that
he
had
managed
everything
beautifully
and
a
sense
of
elation
stole
over
him
to
be
visited
in
this
manner
by
the
gentry
making
free
and
quite
in
a
friendly
way
was
an
honour
he
had
never
looked
for
he
turned
to
northcote
with
great
affability
and
friendliness
well
he
said
northcote
sir
it
ca
be
denied
as
this
is
a
strange
meeting
you
and
may
as
might
be
perhaps
just
the
best
of
friends
to
meet
quite
comfortable
over
a
cup
of
tea
but
ai
it
the
very
best
thing
that
could
happen
men
has
their
public
opinions
sir
as
every
one
should
speak
up
bold
for
and
stick
to
that
my
way
of
thinking
but
i
would
bring
it
no
farther
not
as
might
be
said
into
the
domestic
circle
i
clean
against
that
you
say
your
say
in
public
whatever
you
may
think
on
a
subject
but
you
do
bear
no
malice
it
ai
a
personal
question
them
my
sentiments
and
i
know
nothing
more
elevatin
nothing
more
consolin
than
for
two
public
opponents
as
you
may
say
to
meet
like
this
quite
cozy
and
comfortable
over
a
cup
o
tea
it
is
a
pleasure
i
assure
you
which
i
appreciate
highly
said
reginald
finding
his
voice
and
which
fills
me
with
delight
and
satisfaction
said
northcote
those
which
phoebe
so
to
speak
had
carried
in
in
her
handkerchief
were
only
too
ready
to
fight
you
had
better
have
some
tea
first
she
said
breathless
before
you
talk
so
much
of
its
good
effects
sit
down
grandpapa
and
have
your
muffin
while
it
is
hot
i
know
that
is
what
you
like
do
you
care
about
china
may
but
every
one
cares
for
china
look
at
that
cup
and
fancy
grandmamma
having
this
old
service
in
use
without
knowing
how
valuable
it
is
cream
wedgwood
you
may
fancy
how
i
stared
when
i
saw
it
and
in
everyday
use
most
people
put
it
up
on
brackets
when
they
are
so
lucky
as
to
possess
any
tell
may
grandmamma
how
you
picked
it
up
northcote
there
is
an
article
in
this
review
that
i
want
you
to
look
at
papa
sent
it
to
me
it
is
too
metaphysical
for
me
but
i
know
you
are
great
in
metaphysics
i
am
greater
in
china
may
not
i
look
at
the
wedgwood
first
perhaps
you
will
turn
over
the
literature
to
me
said
reginald
reviews
are
more
in
my
way
than
teacups
though
i
say
it
with
confusion
i
know
how
much
i
am
behind
my
age
and
i
too
whispered
phoebe
behind
the
book
which
she
had
taken
up
do
tell
any
one
it
is
rare
i
know
and
everybody
likes
to
have
something
that
is
rare
but
i
do
really
care
for
it
the
least
in
the
world
i
have
seen
some
bits
of
italian
indeed
but
english
pottery
is
not
like
italian
any
more
than
english
skies
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
miss
beecham
both
as
regards
the
pottery
and
the
skies
ah
if
it
is
an
advantage
bringing
poetry
down
to
prose
is
not
always
an
advantage
is
it
italy
is
such
a
dream
so
long
as
one
has
never
been
there
yes
it
is
a
dream
said
reginald
with
enthusiasm
to
everybody
i
think
but
when
one
has
little
money
and
much
work
all
life
poverty
stands
in
the
way
of
all
kinds
of
enjoyment
poverty
is
a
nice
friendly
sort
of
thing
a
ground
we
can
all
meet
on
said
phoebe
but
do
let
us
say
that
to
grandpapa
how
odd
people
are
he
knows
you
are
not
croesus
but
still
he
has
a
sort
of
feeling
that
you
are
a
young
prince
and
do
him
the
greatest
honour
in
coming
to
his
house
and
yet
all
the
same
he
thinks
that
money
is
the
very
grandest
thing
in
existence
see
what
prejudice
is
he
would
not
allow
that
he
had
any
and
yet
he
can
no
more
get
rid
of
it
miss
beecham
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
say
anything
on
such
a
subject
very
difficult
and
you
show
your
delicacy
by
not
saying
anything
but
you
know
apart
from
this
which
is
not
gratifying
i
am
rather
proud
of
grandpapa
way
of
looking
at
some
things
about
saying
out
your
opinions
in
public
and
yet
bearing
no
malice
for
instance
now
northcote
is
the
very
antipodes
to
you
therefore
you
ought
to
know
him
and
find
out
what
he
means
it
would
be
better
for
you
both
that
is
what
i
call
enlarging
the
mind
said
phoebe
with
a
smile
which
was
to
tell
the
truth
a
very
pretty
smile
and
filled
with
a
soft
lustre
the
blue
eyes
with
which
she
looked
at
him
whether
it
was
this
or
the
cogency
of
her
argument
that
moved
the
young
anglican
it
would
be
hard
to
say
if
you
are
to
be
the
promoter
of
this
new
science
i
do
object
to
studying
under
you
he
said
with
a
great
deal
of
meaning
in
his
voice
phoebe
gave
him
another
smile
though
she
shook
her
head
and
then
she
turned
to
the
hero
on
the
other
side
is
it
genuine
northcote
is
it
as
fine
as
i
thought
there
now
i
told
you
grandmamma
have
you
been
telling
northcote
how
you
picked
it
up
i
am
sure
you
will
present
him
with
a
cup
and
saucer
for
his
collection
in
return
for
his
praises
not
for
the
world
said
northcote
with
profound
seriousness
break
a
set
of
cream
wedgwood
what
do
you
take
me
for
miss
beecham
i
mean
to
say
that
i
would
not
give
my
ears
to
have
it
all
but
to
break
the
set
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
was
not
prepared
for
such
delicacy
of
feeling
such
conscientiousness
ah
said
northcote
with
a
breath
i
do
think
you
can
understand
the
feelings
of
an
enthusiast
a
set
of
fine
china
is
like
a
poem
every
individual
bit
is
necessary
to
the
perfection
of
the
whole
i
allow
that
this
is
not
the
usual
way
of
looking
at
it
but
my
pleasure
lies
in
seeing
it
entire
making
the
into
a
kind
of
lyric
elevating
the
family
life
by
the
application
of
the
principles
of
abstract
beauty
to
its
homeliest
details
pardon
miss
beecham
but
tozer
is
right
and
you
are
wrong
the
idea
of
carrying
off
a
few
lines
of
a
poem
in
one
pocket
for
one
collection
now
that
what
i
call
speaking
up
said
tozer
the
first
time
she
had
opened
her
lips
that
just
what
i
like
northcote
has
a
deal
more
sense
than
the
like
of
you
he
knows
what
what
old
things
like
this
as
might
have
been
my
granny
they
good
enough
for
every
day
they
very
nice
for
common
use
but
they
ai
no
more
fit
to
be
put
away
in
cupboards
and
hoarded
up
like
fine
china
no
more
than
i
am
northcote
should
see
our
best
that
worth
the
looking
at
and
if
i
known
as
the
gentleman
was
coming
but
you
ca
put
an
old
head
on
young
shoulders
phoebe
as
good
as
gold
and
the
trouble
she
takes
with
an
old
woman
like
me
is
wonderful
but
she
ca
be
expected
to
think
of
everything
can
she
now
at
her
age
the
two
young
men
laughed
it
was
the
first
point
of
approach
between
them
and
phoebe
restrained
a
smile
giving
them
a
look
from
one
to
another
she
gave
reginald
his
cup
of
tea
very
graciously
northcote
prefers
the
wedgwood
and
may
does
mind
grandmamma
she
said
sweetly
so
it
is
as
well
to
have
the
best
china
in
the
cupboard
grandpapa
another
muffin
it
is
quite
hot
and
i
know
that
is
what
you
like
best
well
i
say
that
for
phoebe
said
tozer
with
his
mouth
full
that
whether
she
understands
china
or
not
i
ca
tell
but
she
knows
what
a
man
likes
which
is
more
to
the
purpose
for
a
young
woman
that
what
she
does
and
looks
after
folk
comforts
as
i
never
yet
saw
her
match
she
a
girl
in
a
thousand
is
phoebe
junior
there
be
them
as
is
more
for
dress
he
added
fond
and
greasy
looking
at
her
seated
modestly
in
that
gown
which
had
filled
with
awe
and
admiration
the
experienced
mind
of
sam
hurst
and
plays
the
pianny
and
that
sort
of
style
of
girl
but
for
one
as
minds
the
comforts
of
them
about
her
tozer
turned
back
to
the
table
and
made
a
gulp
of
his
last
piece
of
muffin
eloquence
could
have
no
more
striking
climax
the
proof
of
all
his
enthusiasm
was
it
not
there
do
you
play
miss
beecham
said
reginald
a
little
said
phoebe
with
a
laugh
she
had
brought
down
a
small
cottage
piano
out
of
the
where
nobody
ever
touched
it
into
a
dark
corner
out
of
reach
of
the
lamp
it
was
the
only
accomplishment
upon
which
she
prided
herself
she
got
up
from
the
table
when
she
had
poured
out
another
cup
of
tea
for
her
grandfather
and
without
saying
a
word
went
to
the
little
piano
it
was
not
much
of
an
instrument
and
reginald
may
was
very
little
of
a
northcote
who
knew
her
gifts
gave
himself
up
to
listening
but
the
tozers
looked
on
shaking
their
heads
and
it
was
only
after
some
time
had
passed
that
reginald
began
to
understand
that
he
was
listening
to
something
which
he
had
never
heard
before
ursula
tunes
had
never
interested
him
very
much
he
did
not
know
what
this
was
which
seemed
to
creep
into
his
heart
by
his
ears
he
got
up
by
and
by
and
stole
towards
the
piano
bewildered
it
soon
be
over
sir
said
tozer
encouragingly
do
you
run
away
may
them
are
queer
tunes
i
allow
but
they
do
last
long
and
your
company
an
honour
as
for
the
playing
it
soon
be
over
you
need
run
away
chapter
xxvi
the
hall
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
the
dinner
party
in
the
hall
bore
very
little
resemblance
to
those
simple
amusements
in
no
grange
lane
there
were
three
or
four
people
to
meet
may
who
as
an
orator
and
literary
man
had
greater
reputation
even
such
a
little
way
from
home
than
he
had
in
his
own
town
he
was
a
very
good
preacher
and
those
articles
of
his
were
much
admired
as
thoughtful
papers
searching
into
many
mental
depths
and
fathoming
the
religious
soul
with
wonderful
insight
ladies
especially
admired
them
the
ladies
who
were
intellectual
and
found
pleasure
in
the
feeling
of
being
more
advanced
than
their
neighbours
the
rector
wife
of
the
parish
in
which
the
dorsets
lived
applied
herself
with
great
vigour
to
the
art
of
drawing
him
out
she
asked
him
questions
with
that
air
of
delightful
submission
to
an
intellectual
authority
which
some
ladies
love
to
assume
and
which
it
pleases
many
men
to
accept
his
daughters
were
not
at
all
reverential
of
may
and
it
soothed
him
to
get
marks
of
devotion
and
literary
submission
out
of
doors
even
sophy
dorset
had
gone
through
the
phase
of
admiration
for
her
cousin
this
had
been
dissipated
it
is
true
long
ago
but
yet
she
did
not
laugh
as
she
usually
did
at
the
believers
in
him
she
listened
to
rector
plying
him
with
eager
questions
asking
his
advice
on
that
point
and
the
other
and
smiled
but
was
charitable
as
for
cousin
anne
she
was
charitable
by
nature
and
all
the
world
got
the
advantage
of
it
little
ursula
was
one
of
her
prime
favourites
a
motherless
girl
who
was
the
eldest
and
who
had
to
work
for
the
family
was
of
all
others
the
thing
which
moved
her
sympathies
most
the
little
indian
children
had
long
ere
this
yielded
to
the
charms
of
aunt
anne
they
followed
her
wherever
she
went
like
little
spaniels
hanging
on
by
her
dress
she
had
to
go
up
to
the
nursery
to
hear
them
say
their
prayers
before
she
dressed
for
dinner
you
see
this
is
a
proof
that
with
children
one
should
never
be
discouraged
she
said
for
they
did
not
take
to
me
at
first
and
she
turned
her
mild
countenance
beaming
with
soft
light
upon
ursula
to
be
hampered
by
these
babies
clinging
about
her
to
have
them
claiming
imperiously
her
attention
and
her
time
however
she
might
be
engaged
to
give
up
to
them
the
moments
of
leisure
in
which
otherwise
she
might
have
had
a
little
quiet
and
repose
this
was
what
anne
dorset
considered
as
her
recompense
oh
i
wish
i
could
be
as
good
to
amy
and
robin
but
i
feel
as
if
i
should
like
to
shake
them
often
cried
ursula
even
though
i
love
them
with
all
my
heart
oh
cousin
anne
i
do
think
there
is
any
one
like
you
yes
that
is
what
she
thinks
her
reward
said
sophy
i
should
like
something
better
if
it
was
i
do
copy
her
ursula
it
is
better
to
have
children
of
your
own
and
get
other
people
to
nurse
them
anne
you
see
likes
it
i
want
you
to
marry
and
get
all
the
good
things
in
this
life
let
us
leave
the
to
her
she
likes
them
you
perceive
i
do
know
why
you
should
always
talk
of
marrying
to
me
cousin
sophy
said
ursula
with
gentle
reproach
i
hope
i
am
not
a
girl
to
think
of
such
things
and
why
not
is
it
not
the
first
duty
of
woman
you
little
simpleton
said
sophy
dorset
with
a
laugh
but
ursula
could
not
imagine
that
it
was
only
in
this
general
way
that
her
cousin
spoke
she
could
not
but
feel
that
this
big
clarence
copperhead
with
the
diamond
buttons
and
that
huge
expanse
of
had
something
to
do
with
sophy
talk
there
was
six
feet
of
him
which
is
a
thing
that
goes
a
long
way
with
a
girl
and
he
was
not
and
why
did
he
come
to
carlingford
having
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
the
place
and
coming
to
carlingford
why
was
papa
sought
out
of
all
people
to
be
his
tutor
certainly
the
circumstances
were
such
as
invited
conjecture
especially
when
added
on
to
allusions
he
took
ursula
in
to
dinner
which
fluttered
her
somewhat
and
though
he
was
much
intent
upon
the
dinner
itself
and
studied
the
with
a
devotion
which
would
have
made
her
tremble
for
her
housekeeping
had
she
been
sufficiently
disengaged
to
notice
it
he
yet
found
time
to
talk
a
little
between
the
courses
i
did
not
expect
when
i
saw
you
in
london
that
we
were
to
meet
again
so
soon
miss
may
was
the
perfectly
innocent
remark
with
which
he
opened
the
conversation
ursula
would
have
said
it
herself
had
he
not
said
it
and
all
she
could
do
was
to
answer
no
indeed
with
a
smile
and
i
am
coming
to
your
father
to
be
coached
continued
the
young
man
it
is
a
funny
coincidence
do
you
think
so
i
am
glad
you
came
to
that
ball
miss
may
it
makes
me
feel
that
i
know
you
i
do
like
starting
off
afresh
all
at
once
among
people
i
do
know
no
said
ursula
i
should
not
like
it
either
but
there
are
other
people
you
know
in
carlingford
there
is
the
lady
who
was
at
the
ball
the
young
lady
in
black
i
used
to
call
her
miss
beecham
you
must
know
her
better
than
you
know
me
who
phoebe
really
he
said
elevating
his
eyebrows
phoebe
in
carlingford
by
jove
how
the
governor
will
laugh
i
should
like
to
know
with
a
conscious
smile
on
his
countenance
what
is
doing
there
her
grandmamma
is
ill
and
she
is
nursing
her
said
ursula
simply
at
which
young
copperhead
laughed
again
oh
that
is
how
it
is
very
good
of
her
do
you
think
suppose
she
would
be
amusing
the
old
granny
and
phoebe
likes
to
be
amused
i
must
go
to
see
her
as
soon
as
i
can
get
there
you
know
we
are
dissenters
at
home
miss
may
good
joke
is
it
the
governor
will
not
hear
a
word
against
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
nobody
does
go
to
chapel
in
our
rank
of
life
but
the
governor
sometimes
is
as
obstinate
as
an
old
pig
i
suppose
he
likes
it
best
said
ursula
gently
and
here
a
new
course
came
round
and
for
the
moment
clarence
had
something
else
to
do
he
resumed
after
the
which
were
poor
as
he
made
a
mental
note
is
there
anything
to
do
at
carlingford
miss
may
i
hope
you
skate
i
am
not
much
in
the
hunting
way
nor
your
father
i
suppose
for
to
be
sure
a
hunting
parson
would
never
do
i
am
too
heavy
a
weight
for
most
horses
and
the
good
of
galloping
over
the
country
all
day
after
a
poor
brute
of
a
fox
but
we
must
not
say
that
before
sir
robert
i
suppose
it
is
dull
he
said
somewhat
pathetically
looking
in
her
face
we
do
think
it
dull
copperhead
it
may
be
perhaps
for
a
gentleman
that
it
said
clarence
i
do
know
if
it
because
women
have
more
resources
or
because
they
want
less
but
you
always
get
on
better
than
we
do
somehow
very
lucky
for
you
you
do
expect
so
much
i
believe
that
what
it
is
then
that
shows
we
are
the
most
sensible
said
ursula
roused
and
a
little
indignant
he
paused
to
make
his
choice
between
the
inevitable
turkey
and
the
inevitable
beef
i
hope
it
braised
he
said
in
a
devout
undertone
you
do
expect
so
much
miss
may
that
what
it
is
you
always
in
the
house
you
do
care
for
exercise
bless
you
if
i
did
take
exercise
i
should
be
fifteen
stone
before
you
could
turn
round
how
much
are
you
about
eight
perhaps
not
much
more
that
makes
a
deal
of
difference
you
do
require
to
keep
yourself
down
ursula
did
not
make
any
answer
she
was
prepared
to
look
upon
him
very
favourably
and
accept
what
he
said
as
full
of
originality
and
force
but
the
tone
the
conversation
had
taken
was
not
entirely
to
her
mind
phoebe
could
have
managed
it
but
ursula
was
not
phoebe
she
was
more
disposed
to
take
offence
at
the
young
man
tone
than
to
guide
it
into
better
ways
i
hope
your
mother
is
well
she
said
at
last
falteringly
after
a
long
pause
ursula
thought
her
companion
would
remark
this
pause
and
think
her
displeased
she
might
have
saved
herself
the
trouble
for
it
was
the
braised
turkey
which
kept
clarence
quiet
not
offence
oh
quite
well
i
thank
you
not
so
well
as
when
i
am
at
home
she
do
like
parting
with
me
he
said
but
of
course
i
ca
be
always
at
my
mother
women
forget
that
she
was
very
kind
when
i
was
in
london
yes
that
just
pleases
her
she
is
never
so
happy
as
when
she
is
buying
things
for
somebody
he
replied
betraying
an
acquaintance
with
the
exact
manner
of
the
kindness
which
somewhat
disturbed
poor
ursula
that
is
exactly
her
way
i
dare
say
she
come
and
see
the
dorsets
while
here
then
there
was
again
a
pause
and
clarence
turned
to
speak
to
some
one
at
his
other
side
no
i
do
hunt
much
he
said
i
have
come
into
the
country
to
be
coached
my
father
a
modern
sort
of
man
and
wants
a
fellow
to
be
up
in
history
and
that
sort
of
thing
bore
yes
and
i
dare
say
carlingford
is
very
dull
oh
yes
i
will
go
out
with
the
hounds
now
and
then
if
there
is
not
a
frost
i
should
rather
like
a
frost
for
my
part
it
was
a
hunting
lady
who
had
started
this
new
conversation
into
which
the
stranger
had
drifted
away
leaving
ursula
stranded
she
was
slightly
piqued
it
must
be
allowed
and
when
sophy
asked
her
after
dinner
how
she
liked
her
companion
made
a
dignified
reply
i
have
no
doubt
he
is
very
nice
she
said
i
do
know
much
of
gentlemen
he
talks
of
papa
as
if
he
were
a
and
thinks
carlingford
will
be
dull
so
it
is
ursula
i
have
often
heard
you
say
so
yes
perhaps
but
a
stranger
ought
to
be
civil
said
the
girl
offended
and
she
went
and
entrenched
herself
by
the
side
of
cousin
anne
where
the
new
pupil
could
not
come
near
her
indeed
he
did
not
seem
very
anxious
to
do
so
as
ursula
soon
saw
she
blushed
very
hotly
all
by
herself
under
cousin
anne
shadow
that
she
could
have
been
so
absurd
as
ever
to
think
but
his
size
and
the
weight
over
which
he
had
lamented
and
his
abundant
whiskers
and
large
shirt
front
made
it
quite
impossible
for
ursula
to
think
of
him
as
a
person
to
be
educated
it
must
be
miss
beecham
she
said
to
herself
no
thoughts
of
this
kind
crossed
clarence
copperhead
mind
as
he
stretched
his
big
limbs
before
the
fire
after
dinner
and
said
brava
when
the
ladies
sang
he
knew
brava
was
the
right
thing
to
say
he
liked
to
be
at
the
hall
which
he
had
never
visited
before
and
to
know
that
it
was
undeniable
gentry
which
surrounded
him
and
which
at
the
piano
was
endeavouring
to
gain
his
approbation
he
was
so
much
his
father
son
that
he
had
a
sense
of
pleasure
and
triumph
in
being
thus
elevated
and
he
had
a
feeling
more
or
less
of
contempt
for
the
clergyman
only
a
parson
who
was
to
be
his
coach
he
felt
the
power
and
the
beauty
of
money
almost
as
much
as
his
father
did
what
was
there
he
could
not
buy
with
it
the
services
of
the
most
learned
pundit
in
existence
for
what
was
learning
or
the
prettiest
woman
going
to
be
his
wife
if
that
was
what
he
wanted
it
may
be
supposed
then
that
he
had
very
little
attention
indeed
to
bestow
upon
a
girl
like
ursula
who
was
only
the
daughter
of
his
coach
nobody
at
all
in
particular
and
that
her
foolish
fancies
on
the
subject
might
have
been
spared
he
aired
himself
on
the
with
great
satisfaction
giving
now
and
then
a
shake
to
one
of
his
long
limbs
and
a
furtive
glance
to
see
that
all
was
perfect
in
the
of
the
garment
that
clothed
it
he
had
been
ploughed
it
is
true
but
that
did
not
interfere
much
with
his
mental
satisfaction
for
after
all
scholarship
was
a
thing
cultivated
chiefly
by
dons
and
prigs
and
poor
men
and
no
doubt
this
other
poor
man
the
parson
would
be
able
to
put
all
into
his
head
that
was
necessary
just
as
much
as
would
pay
and
no
more
a
process
the
mere
thought
of
which
made
clarence
yawn
yet
which
he
had
wound
up
his
noble
mind
to
submit
to
mind
you
i
do
say
i
am
going
to
work
he
had
said
to
his
mother
but
if
you
think
he
can
put
it
into
me
he
may
try
and
he
repeated
much
the
same
sentiment
with
a
difference
to
sophy
dorset
who
by
way
of
civility
while
the
rector
wife
paid
court
to
may
talked
to
clarence
a
little
from
the
corner
of
the
ottoman
close
to
the
fire
work
well
i
suppose
so
after
a
sort
i
do
mean
to
make
myself
ill
with
midnight
oil
and
that
sort
of
thing
he
said
he
was
not
at
all
clear
in
his
mind
as
to
how
the
midnight
oil
was
applied
but
if
may
can
get
it
into
me
i
give
him
leave
for
one
thing
i
suppose
there
will
be
nothing
else
to
do
not
much
in
carlingford
there
are
neither
pictures
nor
museums
nor
fine
buildings
nor
anything
of
the
sort
and
very
little
society
a
few
and
one
ball
in
the
season
clarence
copperhead
shrugged
his
large
shoulders
i
sha
go
to
the
that
certain
he
said
a
fellow
must
hunt
a
little
i
suppose
as
the
place
is
so
destitute
as
for
pictures
and
museums
that
do
trouble
me
the
worst
of
going
abroad
is
that
you
always
got
to
look
at
things
of
that
sort
to
have
to
do
it
at
home
would
be
beyond
a
joke
have
you
seen
the
box
of
curious
things
john
sent
me
with
the
children
said
sophy
they
are
on
the
table
at
the
end
of
the
room
yataghans
and
i
do
know
what
other
names
they
have
all
sorts
of
indian
weapons
i
should
think
you
would
be
interested
in
them
thanks
cousin
sophy
i
am
very
well
where
i
am
he
said
he
looked
at
her
in
such
a
way
that
she
might
have
appropriated
this
remark
as
a
compliment
had
she
pleased
but
sophy
laughed
and
it
is
to
be
feared
did
not
feel
the
compliment
for
she
turned
right
round
to
somebody
else
and
took
no
more
notice
of
clarence
he
was
so
fully
satisfied
with
himself
that
he
had
not
any
strong
sense
of
neglect
though
he
had
but
little
conversation
with
the
company
he
was
quite
satisfied
to
exhibit
himself
and
his
before
the
fire
next
day
he
accompanied
the
mays
back
to
carlingford
may
had
enjoyed
his
visit
his
mind
was
free
for
the
moment
he
had
staved
off
the
evil
day
and
he
had
a
little
money
in
his
pocket
the
remains
of
that
extra
fifty
pounds
which
he
had
put
on
to
tozer
bill
with
some
of
it
he
had
paid
some
urgent
debts
and
he
had
presented
five
pounds
to
cotsdean
to
buy
his
wife
a
gown
and
he
had
a
little
money
in
his
pockets
so
that
in
every
way
he
was
comfortable
and
more
at
ease
than
usual
the
reckoning
was
four
months
off
which
was
like
an
eternity
to
him
in
his
present
mood
of
mind
and
of
course
he
would
get
the
money
before
that
time
there
was
so
much
time
indeed
that
to
begin
to
think
of
the
ways
and
means
of
paying
it
at
this
early
period
seemed
absurd
he
was
to
have
three
hundred
pounds
for
the
year
of
residence
with
him
if
he
stayed
so
long
and
that
would
do
if
nothing
else
therefore
may
was
quite
easy
in
his
mind
not
in
the
least
feeling
the
possibility
of
trouble
in
store
for
him
and
the
visit
had
been
pleasant
he
had
enlarged
his
acquaintance
and
that
among
the
very
sort
of
people
he
cared
to
know
he
had
been
very
well
received
by
all
the
dorsets
and
introduced
by
sir
robert
as
a
relation
and
he
had
received
some
personal
incense
about
his
works
and
his
gifts
which
was
sweet
to
him
therefore
he
was
in
very
good
spirits
and
exceedingly
amiable
he
conversed
with
his
future
pupil
urbanely
though
he
had
not
concealed
his
entire
concurrence
in
sir
robert
opinion
that
he
was
a
cub
what
have
you
been
reading
lately
he
asked
when
they
had
been
transferred
from
the
dorsets
carriage
to
the
admiration
and
by
the
obsequious
cares
of
all
the
attendant
officials
into
the
railway
carriage
may
liked
the
fuss
and
liked
the
idea
of
that
superiority
which
attended
the
dorsets
guests
he
had
just
been
explaining
to
his
companions
that
sir
robert
was
the
lord
of
the
manor
and
that
all
the
homage
done
to
him
was
perfectly
natural
and
he
was
in
great
even
with
this
cub
well
i
not
been
reading
very
much
said
clarence
candidly
what
was
the
good
the
governor
did
not
want
me
to
be
a
parson
or
a
lawyer
or
anything
of
that
sort
and
a
fellow
wants
some
sort
of
a
motive
to
read
i
loafed
a
good
deal
i
afraid
i
got
into
a
very
good
set
you
know
first
chop
lord
southdown
and
the
beauchamps
and
that
lot
and
well
i
suppose
we
were
idle
and
that
the
truth
i
see
said
may
a
good
deal
of
smoke
and
billiards
and
so
forth
and
very
little
work
that
about
it
said
the
young
man
settling
himself
and
his
trousers
which
were
the
objects
of
a
great
deal
of
affectionate
care
on
his
part
he
gave
them
furtive
pulls
at
the
knees
and
stroked
them
down
towards
the
ankle
as
he
got
himself
comfortably
into
his
seat
may
looked
at
him
with
scientific
observation
and
ursula
with
curiosity
his
was
an
offence
to
the
girl
but
it
was
only
amusing
to
her
father
an
unmitigated
cub
may
pronounced
to
himself
but
there
where
he
sat
he
represented
three
hundred
and
that
at
least
was
not
to
be
despised
ursula
was
not
so
charitable
as
her
father
she
was
not
amused
by
him
in
the
slightest
degree
had
he
come
down
to
carlingford
in
humble
worship
of
her
pretty
eyes
and
with
a
romantic
intention
of
making
himself
agreeable
to
her
the
captivating
flattery
would
have
prepossessed
ursula
and
prepared
her
to
see
him
in
a
very
pleasant
light
and
put
the
best
interpretation
upon
all
he
did
and
said
but
this
pretty
delusion
being
dissipated
ursula
was
angry
with
herself
for
having
been
so
foolish
and
naturally
angry
with
clarence
for
having
led
her
into
it
though
he
was
quite
without
blame
in
the
matter
she
looked
at
him
in
his
corner
he
had
taken
the
best
corner
without
consulting
her
inclinations
and
thought
him
a
vulgar
coxcomb
which
perhaps
he
was
but
she
would
not
have
been
so
indignant
except
for
that
little
bit
of
injured
feeling
for
which
really
after
all
he
was
not
justly
to
blame
chapter
xxvii
a
pair
of
natural
enemies
after
the
evening
at
grange
lane
which
has
been
described
reginald
may
met
northcote
in
the
street
several
times
as
was
unavoidable
considering
the
size
of
the
place
and
the
concentration
of
all
business
in
carlingford
within
the
restricted
length
of
the
high
street
the
two
young
men
bowed
stiffly
to
each
other
at
first
then
by
dint
of
seeing
each
other
frequently
got
to
inclinations
a
little
more
friendly
until
at
length
one
day
when
northcote
was
passing
by
the
college
as
reginald
stood
in
the
old
doorway
the
young
chaplain
feeling
magnanimous
on
his
own
ground
and
somewhat
amused
by
the
idea
which
suddenly
presented
itself
to
him
asked
his
dissenting
assailant
if
he
would
not
come
in
and
see
the
place
reginald
had
the
best
of
it
in
every
way
it
was
he
who
was
the
superior
holding
out
a
hand
of
favour
and
kindness
to
one
who
here
at
least
was
beneath
him
in
social
consideration
and
it
was
he
who
was
the
assailed
and
so
to
speak
injured
party
and
who
nevertheless
extended
to
his
assailant
a
polite
recognition
which
perhaps
no
one
else
occupying
the
same
position
would
have
given
he
was
amused
by
his
own
magnanimity
and
enjoyed
it
and
the
pleasure
of
heaping
coals
of
fire
upon
his
adversary
head
was
entirely
delightful
to
him
i
know
you
do
not
approve
of
the
place
or
me
he
said
forgetting
in
that
moment
of
triumph
all
his
own
objections
to
it
and
the
ground
upon
which
these
objections
were
founded
come
in
and
see
it
will
you
the
chapel
and
the
rooms
are
worth
seeing
they
are
fair
memorials
of
the
past
however
little
the
foundation
may
be
to
your
mind
he
laughed
as
he
spoke
but
without
for
it
is
easy
to
be
when
one
feels
one
self
on
the
gaining
not
the
losing
side
as
for
northcote
pride
kept
him
from
any
demonstration
of
unwillingness
to
look
at
what
the
other
had
to
show
he
would
not
for
worlds
have
betrayed
himself
it
was
expedient
for
him
if
he
did
not
mean
to
acknowledge
himself
worsted
to
put
on
a
good
face
and
accept
the
politeness
cheerfully
so
that
it
was
on
the
very
strength
of
the
conflict
which
made
them
first
aware
of
each
other
existence
that
they
thus
came
together
the
dissenter
declared
his
entire
delight
in
being
taken
to
see
the
place
and
with
secret
satisfaction
not
easily
put
into
words
the
churchman
led
the
way
they
went
to
all
the
rooms
where
the
old
men
sat
some
dozing
by
the
fire
some
reading
some
busy
about
small
businesses
one
had
a
another
was
illuminating
texts
a
third
had
a
collection
of
curiosities
of
a
heterogeneous
kind
which
he
was
cleaning
and
arranging
writing
neat
little
labels
in
the
neatest
little
hand
for
each
article
the
charity
of
our
ancestors
might
have
been
worse
employed
said
reginald
a
home
for
the
old
and
poor
is
surely
as
fine
a
kind
of
benevolence
as
one
could
think
of
if
benevolence
is
to
be
tolerated
at
all
said
northcote
i
do
pretend
to
disapprove
of
benevolence
perhaps
the
young
who
have
a
future
before
them
who
can
be
of
use
to
their
country
are
better
objects
still
because
they
will
pay
said
reginald
because
we
can
get
something
out
of
them
in
return
while
we
have
already
got
all
that
is
to
be
had
out
of
the
old
people
a
very
modern
doctrine
but
not
so
lovely
as
the
way
i
did
not
mean
that
said
the
other
colouring
certainly
it
ought
to
pay
everything
i
suppose
is
meant
to
pay
one
way
or
other
the
life
and
progress
of
the
young
or
the
gratified
sentiment
of
the
benefactor
who
feels
that
he
has
provided
for
the
old
which
is
the
noblest
kind
of
payment
i
think
the
first
for
my
part
for
that
matter
there
is
a
large
and
most
flourishing
school
which
you
will
come
across
without
fail
if
you
work
among
the
poor
do
you
work
among
the
poor
pardon
my
curiosity
i
do
know
it
depends
upon
what
you
call
the
poor
said
the
other
who
did
not
like
to
acknowledge
the
absence
of
this
element
in
salem
chapel
if
you
mean
the
destitute
classes
the
lowest
level
no
but
if
you
mean
the
respectable
comfortable
persons
of
small
income
said
reginald
i
mean
people
with
no
incomes
at
all
people
without
trades
or
anything
to
earn
a
comfortable
living
by
labouring
people
here
and
away
women
who
take
in
washing
and
men
who
go
about
hunting
for
a
day
work
these
are
the
kind
of
people
the
church
is
weighted
with
i
do
see
any
trace
of
them
said
the
nonconformist
smooth
lawns
fine
trees
rooms
that
countesses
might
live
in
i
ca
see
any
trace
of
them
here
there
is
no
harm
in
a
bit
of
grass
and
a
few
trees
and
the
rooms
are
cheaper
in
their
long
continuance
than
any
flimsy
new
rubbish
that
could
be
built
i
know
i
am
making
an
unfortunate
quotation
said
northcote
but
there
is
reason
in
it
it
might
be
sold
for
so
much
and
given
to
the
poor
cheating
the
poor
in
the
first
place
said
reginald
warmly
concerned
for
what
he
felt
to
be
his
own
just
as
the
paddock
an
old
horse
dies
in
might
bear
a
crop
instead
and
pay
the
owner
but
what
would
become
of
the
old
horse
of
this
space
would
do
quite
as
well
for
your
pensioners
and
they
might
do
without
a
chaplain
said
reginald
laughing
in
spite
of
himself
i
know
you
think
so
it
is
a
sinecure
well
i
think
they
may
say
their
prayers
for
themselves
a
young
man
like
you
full
of
talent
full
of
capability
i
beg
your
pardon
said
northcote
you
must
excuse
me
i
grudge
the
waste
there
are
so
many
things
more
worthy
of
you
that
you
might
do
what
for
example
anything
almost
cried
the
other
digging
ploughing
building
anything
and
for
me
too
this
he
said
in
an
undertone
but
reginald
heard
and
did
not
carry
his
magnanimity
so
far
as
not
to
reply
yes
he
said
if
i
am
wasted
reading
prayers
for
my
old
men
what
are
you
who
come
to
agitate
for
my
abolition
think
too
almost
anything
would
be
better
than
to
encourage
the
ignorant
to
make
themselves
judges
of
public
institutions
which
the
wisest
even
find
too
delicate
to
meddle
with
the
digging
and
the
ploughing
might
be
a
good
thing
for
more
than
me
i
do
say
otherwise
said
the
young
dissenter
following
into
the
old
chapel
small
but
perfect
the
young
priest
of
the
place
they
stood
together
for
a
moment
under
the
vaulted
roof
both
young
in
the
glory
of
their
days
both
with
vague
noble
meanings
in
them
which
they
knew
so
poorly
how
to
carry
out
they
meant
everything
that
was
fine
and
great
these
two
young
men
standing
upon
the
threshold
of
their
life
knowing
little
more
than
that
they
were
fiercely
opposed
to
each
other
and
meant
to
reform
the
world
each
in
his
own
way
one
by
careful
services
and
visitings
of
the
poor
the
other
by
the
liberation
society
and
overthrow
of
the
state
church
both
foolish
wrong
and
right
to
the
utmost
bounds
of
human
possibility
how
different
they
felt
themselves
standing
there
and
yet
how
much
at
one
they
were
without
knowing
it
northcote
had
sufficient
knowledge
to
admire
the
perfect
old
building
he
followed
his
guide
with
a
certain
humility
through
the
details
which
reginald
had
already
learned
by
heart
there
is
nothing
so
perfect
so
beautiful
so
real
said
the
young
churchman
with
a
natural
expansion
of
mind
over
the
beauty
to
which
he
had
fallen
heir
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
looked
up
at
the
tall
windows
with
their
graceful
tracery
that
he
was
the
representative
of
all
who
had
worked
out
their
belief
in
god
within
these
beautiful
walls
and
of
all
the
perpetual
worshippers
who
had
knelt
among
the
old
brasses
of
the
early
founders
upon
the
worn
floor
the
other
stood
beside
him
with
a
half
envy
in
his
mind
the
dissenter
did
not
feel
himself
the
heir
of
those
centuries
in
the
same
unhesitating
way
he
tried
to
feel
that
he
was
the
heir
of
something
better
and
more
spiritual
yet
felt
a
not
ungenerous
grudge
that
he
could
not
share
the
other
kinship
too
it
is
very
beautiful
and
noble
he
said
i
should
like
to
feel
for
it
as
you
do
but
what
i
should
like
still
better
would
be
to
have
the
same
clear
certainty
of
faith
the
same
conviction
that
what
they
were
doing
was
the
only
right
thing
to
do
which
made
both
building
and
prayer
so
unfaltering
in
those
days
we
ca
be
so
sure
even
of
the
span
of
an
arch
now
no
nor
can
you
be
content
with
the
old
span
even
though
it
is
clearly
the
best
by
all
rules
said
reginald
the
other
smiled
he
was
the
most
speculative
of
the
two
being
perhaps
the
most
thoughtful
and
he
had
no
chapel
to
charm
nor
old
foundation
to
give
him
an
anchor
he
smiled
but
there
was
a
little
envy
in
his
mind
even
to
have
one
life
set
out
before
one
within
clear
lines
like
this
would
not
that
be
something
if
it
had
but
been
possible
no
doubt
saying
prayers
for
the
world
even
with
no
better
than
the
old
men
of
the
college
to
say
amen
had
something
more
beautiful
in
it
than
tours
of
agitation
for
the
liberation
society
but
northcote
knew
that
for
him
it
was
not
possible
any
more
than
was
the
tonsure
of
reginald
predecessor
who
had
said
mass
when
first
those
pinnacles
were
reared
towards
heaven
after
he
had
smiled
he
sighed
for
the
old
faith
was
more
lovely
than
all
the
new
agitations
he
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
the
liberation
society
so
long
as
he
stood
under
that
groined
and
glorious
roof
may
said
some
one
coming
in
suddenly
i
want
you
to
go
to
the
hospital
for
me
i
am
obliged
to
go
off
to
town
on
urgent
business
convocation
work
and
i
must
get
a
lawyer
opinion
about
the
reredos
question
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
go
and
see
the
people
in
the
pulmonary
ward
there
a
good
fellow
and
there
are
two
or
three
bad
accidents
and
that
old
woman
who
is
ill
in
brown
cottage
you
saw
her
the
other
day
and
the
simmonds
in
back
grove
street
i
should
have
had
a
day
work
well
cut
out
if
i
had
not
had
this
summons
to
town
but
the
reredos
question
is
of
the
first
importance
you
know
i
go
said
reginald
there
is
nothing
more
effectual
in
showing
us
the
weakness
of
any
habitual
fallacy
or
assumption
than
to
hear
it
sympathetically
through
the
ears
as
it
were
of
a
sceptic
reginald
seeing
northcote
keen
eyes
gleam
at
the
sound
of
the
rector
voice
instinctively
fell
into
sympathy
with
him
and
heard
the
speech
through
him
and
though
he
himself
felt
the
importance
of
the
reredos
yet
he
saw
in
a
moment
how
such
a
question
would
take
shape
in
the
opinion
of
the
young
dissenter
in
whom
he
clearly
saw
certain
resemblances
to
himself
therefore
he
assented
very
briefly
taking
out
his
to
put
down
the
special
cases
of
which
the
rector
told
him
they
had
a
confidential
conversation
in
a
corner
during
which
the
contemplated
the
figure
of
northcote
in
his
strange
garments
with
some
amaze
who
is
your
friend
he
said
abruptly
for
he
was
a
rapid
man
losing
no
time
about
anything
it
is
not
my
friend
at
all
it
is
my
enemy
who
denounced
me
at
the
dissenters
meeting
pah
cried
the
rector
curling
up
his
nostrils
as
if
some
disagreeable
smell
had
reached
him
a
dissenter
here
i
should
not
have
expected
it
from
you
may
nor
i
either
said
reginald
but
his
colour
rose
he
was
not
disposed
to
be
rebuked
by
any
rector
in
carlingford
or
the
world
are
you
his
curate
said
northcote
that
he
orders
you
about
as
if
you
were
bound
to
do
his
bidding
i
hope
for
your
own
sake
it
is
not
so
now
it
was
reginald
turn
to
smile
he
was
young
and
liked
a
bit
of
grandiloquence
as
well
as
another
since
i
have
been
here
he
said
in
this
sinecure
as
you
call
it
and
such
it
almost
is
i
have
been
everybody
curate
if
the
others
have
too
much
work
and
i
too
little
my
duty
is
clear
do
you
think
northcote
made
no
reply
had
he
known
what
was
about
to
be
said
to
him
he
might
have
stirred
up
his
faculties
to
say
something
but
he
had
not
an
idea
that
reginald
would
answer
him
like
this
and
it
took
him
aback
he
was
too
honest
himself
not
to
be
worsted
by
such
a
speech
he
bowed
his
head
with
genuine
respect
the
apology
of
the
churchman
whom
he
had
assaulted
filled
him
with
a
kind
of
reverential
confusion
he
could
make
no
reply
in
words
and
need
it
be
said
that
reginald
heart
too
melted
altogether
when
he
saw
how
he
had
confounded
his
adversary
that
silent
assent
more
than
made
up
for
the
noisy
onslaught
that
he
should
have
thus
overcome
northcote
made
northcote
appear
his
friend
he
was
pleased
and
satisfied
beyond
the
reach
of
words
will
you
come
to
the
hospital
with
me
he
said
and
they
walked
out
together
the
young
dissenter
saying
very
little
doing
what
he
could
to
arrange
those
new
lights
which
had
suddenly
flashed
upon
his
favourite
subject
and
feeling
that
he
had
lost
his
landmarks
and
was
confused
in
his
path
when
the
logic
is
taken
out
of
all
that
a
man
is
doing
what
is
to
become
of
him
this
was
what
he
felt
an
ideal
person
in
reginald
place
could
not
have
made
a
better
answer
suddenly
somehow
by
a
strange
law
of
association
there
came
into
his
mind
the
innocent
talk
he
had
overheard
between
the
two
girls
who
were
he
was
aware
may
sisters
a
certain
romantic
curiosity
about
the
family
came
into
his
mind
certainly
they
could
not
be
an
ordinary
family
like
others
there
must
be
something
in
their
constitution
to
account
for
this
sudden
downfall
which
he
had
encountered
in
the
midst
of
all
his
theories
the
mays
must
be
people
of
a
different
strain
from
others
a
peculiar
race
to
whom
great
thoughts
were
familiar
he
could
not
believe
that
there
was
anything
common
or
ordinary
in
their
blood
he
went
out
in
silence
with
the
holder
of
the
sinecure
which
he
had
so
denounced
but
which
now
seemed
to
him
to
be
held
after
a
divine
fashion
in
a
way
which
common
men
had
no
idea
of
very
little
could
he
say
and
that
of
the
most
commonplace
kind
he
walked
quite
respectfully
by
the
young
side
along
the
crowded
high
street
though
without
any
intention
of
going
to
the
hospital
or
of
actually
witnessing
the
kind
of
work
undertaken
by
his
new
friend
northcote
himself
had
no
turn
that
way
to
go
and
minister
at
a
had
never
been
his
custom
he
did
not
understand
how
to
do
it
and
though
he
had
a
kind
of
sense
that
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
and
that
if
any
one
demanded
such
a
service
of
him
he
would
be
obliged
to
render
it
he
was
all
in
the
dark
as
to
how
he
could
get
through
so
painful
an
office
whereas
may
went
to
it
without
fear
thinking
of
it
only
as
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
perhaps
it
is
possible
northcote
ministrations
had
he
been
fully
roused
would
have
been
in
mere
consequence
of
the
reluctance
of
his
mind
to
undertake
them
more
real
and
impressive
than
those
which
reginald
went
to
discharge
as
a
daily
though
serious
duty
but
in
any
case
it
was
the
churchman
whose
mode
was
the
more
practical
the
more
useful
they
had
not
gone
far
together
when
they
met
the
rector
hurrying
to
the
railway
he
cast
a
frowning
dissatisfied
look
at
northcote
and
caught
reginald
by
the
arm
drawing
him
aside
do
be
seen
walking
about
with
that
fellow
he
said
it
will
injure
you
in
people
minds
what
have
you
to
do
with
a
dissenter
a
demagogue
your
father
would
not
like
it
any
more
than
i
do
get
rid
of
him
may
i
am
sorry
to
displease
either
you
or
my
father
said
reginald
stiffly
but
pardon
me
in
this
respect
i
must
judge
for
myself
do
be
said
the
spiritual
ruler
of
carlingford
but
he
had
to
rush
off
for
his
train
and
had
no
time
to
say
more
he
left
reginald
hot
and
angry
doubly
disposed
as
was
natural
to
march
northcote
over
all
the
town
and
show
his
intimacy
with
him
get
rid
of
an
acquaintance
whom
he
chose
to
extend
his
countenance
to
to
please
the
rector
for
a
man
so
young
as
reginald
may
and
so
lately
made
independent
such
an
act
of
subserviency
was
impossible
indeed
before
they
entered
the
hospital
however
another
encounter
happened
of
a
very
different
character
strolling
along
in
the
centre
of
the
pavement
endeavouring
after
the
almost
impossible
combination
of
a
yawn
and
a
cigar
they
perceived
a
large
figure
in
a
very
long
and
with
an
aspect
of
languor
and
which
was
unmistakable
a
hundred
yards
off
this
apparition
called
a
sudden
exclamation
from
northcote
if
it
was
possible
he
said
i
should
imagine
i
knew
that
man
are
there
two
like
him
but
i
ca
fancy
what
he
can
be
doing
here
fellow
said
reginald
it
a
pity
if
there
are
two
like
him
i
ca
tell
you
what
a
nuisance
he
is
to
me
his
name
is
copperhead
he
my
father
pupil
then
it
copperhead
i
thought
there
could
not
be
another
he
gives
a
sort
of
odd
familiar
aspect
to
the
place
all
at
once
then
you
are
a
friend
of
his
said
reginald
with
a
groan
pardon
the
natural
feelings
of
a
man
whose
father
has
suddenly
chosen
to
become
a
coach
i
hate
it
and
my
dislike
to
the
thing
is
reflected
on
the
person
of
the
pupil
i
suppose
that
what
my
antipathy
means
he
does
not
merit
antipathy
he
is
a
bore
but
there
is
no
harm
in
him
ah
he
is
quickening
his
pace
i
am
afraid
he
has
seen
us
and
anybody
he
knows
will
be
a
godsend
to
him
i
suppose
i
am
off
said
reginald
you
will
come
again
that
is
he
added
with
winning
politeness
i
shall
come
and
seek
you
out
we
are
each
the
moral
antipodes
of
the
other
miss
beecham
says
from
which
she
argues
that
we
should
be
acquainted
and
learn
the
meaning
of
our
differences
i
am
much
obliged
to
miss
beecham
why
northcote
said
clarence
copperhead
bearing
down
upon
them
in
his
big
grey
ulster
like
a
ship
in
full
sail
morning
may
who
have
thought
to
see
you
here
oh
do
turn
on
my
account
i
only
taking
a
walk
it
do
matter
which
way
i
go
i
am
very
much
hurried
i
was
just
about
to
hasten
off
to
an
appointment
northcote
said
reginald
we
shall
meet
again
soon
i
hope
by
jove
this
is
a
surprise
said
clarence
to
see
you
here
where
i
should
as
soon
have
thought
of
looking
for
paul
and
to
find
you
walking
about
cheek
by
jowl
with
that
muff
young
may
who
could
be
civil
i
think
if
he
were
to
try
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
i
suppose
you
just
as
much
startled
to
see
me
i
with
a
coach
clever
and
a
good
scholar
and
a
good
family
and
all
that
father
to
that
young
sprig
so
there
ai
any
mystery
about
me
what
brought
you
here
work
said
northcote
curtly
he
did
not
feel
disposed
to
enter
into
any
kind
of
explanation
oh
work
now
i
do
wonder
that
a
fellow
like
you
with
plenty
of
money
in
your
pocket
should
go
in
for
work
as
you
do
what
the
good
of
it
and
in
the
dissenting
parson
line
of
all
things
in
the
world
when
a
fellow
has
nothing
you
can
understand
it
he
must
get
his
grub
somehow
that
what
people
think
of
you
of
course
me
i
do
do
anything
and
everybody
knows
i
a
catch
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
now
i
do
say
for
i
do
know
if
your
governor
has
as
much
to
leave
behind
him
as
mine
but
halt
a
bit
you
walk
as
if
we
were
going
in
for
athletics
and
doing
a
two
mile
i
sorry
to
see
you
so
easily
blown
said
northcote
not
displeased
in
his
turn
to
say
something
unpleasant
what
is
it
or
are
you
only
out
of
training
that
it
said
clarence
with
a
gasp
i
awfully
out
of
training
and
that
the
fact
we
do
perhaps
live
too
well
in
portland
place
but
look
here
about
what
we
were
saying
do
you
live
with
the
mays
worse
luck
it
what
you
call
plain
cooking
and
bless
us
all
dinner
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
the
children
at
table
but
i
put
a
stop
to
that
and
old
may
ai
a
bad
old
fellow
do
bother
me
with
work
more
than
i
like
and
none
of
your
high
mightiness
like
that
fellow
i
tell
you
what
northcote
you
must
come
and
see
me
i
have
got
a
of
my
own
which
is
a
shame
but
i
have
the
use
of
their
rooms
as
much
as
i
like
the
sisters
go
flying
away
like
a
flock
of
pigeons
i
tell
you
what
i
have
you
asked
to
dinner
capital
fun
it
will
be
a
high
church
parson
cheek
by
jowl
with
a
dissenter
and
compelled
to
be
civil
by
jove
wo
it
be
a
joke
it
is
not
a
joke
that
either
of
us
will
enjoy
never
mind
enjoy
it
by
jove
said
copperhead
he
dare
say
no
i
give
sixpence
just
to
see
you
together
and
the
bashaw
of
two
tails
the
young
fellow
they
shall
have
a
party
leave
it
all
to
me
chapter
xxviii
the
new
pupil
may
since
the
bargain
was
fairly
concluded
with
the
copperheads
had
thought
a
great
deal
about
the
three
hundred
he
was
to
get
for
his
pupil
it
almost
doubled
his
income
in
a
moment
and
that
has
a
great
effect
upon
the
imagination
it
was
true
he
would
have
another
person
to
maintain
on
this
additional
income
but
still
that
additional
person
would
simply
fill
reginald
place
and
it
did
not
at
first
occur
to
him
that
what
was
good
enough
for
himself
may
of
roque
was
not
good
enough
for
any
on
the
face
of
the
earth
therefore
the
additional
income
represented
a
great
deal
of
additional
comfort
and
that
general
expansion
of
expenditure
not
going
into
any
special
extravagances
but
representing
a
universal
ease
and
enlargement
which
was
congenial
to
him
and
which
was
one
of
the
great
charms
of
money
in
his
eyes
to
be
sure
when
he
reflected
on
the
matter
he
felt
that
the
first
of
clarence
payment
ought
to
be
appropriated
to
that
bill
which
for
the
present
had
brought
him
so
much
relief
but
this
would
be
so
entirely
to
lose
the
benefit
of
the
money
so
far
as
he
was
himself
concerned
that
it
was
only
in
moments
of
reflection
that
this
appeared
urgent
the
bill
to
which
tozer
signature
had
been
appended
did
not
oppress
his
conscience
after
all
what
was
it
not
a
very
large
sum
a
sum
which
when
put
to
it
and
with
time
before
him
he
could
so
easily
supply
and
as
for
any
other
consideration
it
was
really
when
you
came
to
think
of
it
a
quite
justifiable
expedient
not
to
be
condemned
except
by
squeamish
persons
and
which
being
never
known
could
do
no
harm
in
the
world
he
had
not
harmed
anybody
by
what
he
had
done
tozer
who
was
quite
able
to
pay
it
over
and
over
again
would
never
know
of
it
and
in
what
respect
he
asked
himself
was
it
worse
to
have
done
this
than
to
have
a
bill
really
signed
by
a
man
of
straw
whose
value
received
meant
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
simple
fiction
cotsdean
was
no
more
than
a
man
of
straw
if
left
to
himself
he
could
not
pay
anything
nor
had
he
anything
really
to
do
with
the
business
for
which
his
name
stood
sponsor
and
tozer
name
was
merely
placed
there
in
the
same
fictitious
way
without
any
trouble
to
tozer
or
burden
of
responsibility
what
was
the
difference
except
that
it
saved
trouble
and
anxiety
to
everybody
except
the
principal
in
the
affair
he
who
ought
to
bear
the
brunt
may
recognised
this
without
doubt
it
was
he
who
had
reaped
the
advantage
and
whether
cotsdean
was
the
instrument
who
knew
all
about
it
or
tozer
who
did
not
know
anything
about
it
it
was
he
may
whose
natural
duty
it
was
to
meet
the
claim
and
pay
the
money
he
was
an
honest
man
if
he
was
occasionally
a
little
slow
in
his
payments
no
one
could
throw
any
doubt
upon
his
character
but
of
course
should
any
unforeseen
emergency
arise
the
pupil
at
once
made
that
straight
may
felt
that
he
had
only
to
go
to
the
bank
which
generally
did
not
encourage
his
visits
and
tell
them
of
his
pupil
to
have
the
money
at
once
nobody
could
reject
such
unmistakeable
security
so
that
really
there
was
no
further
occasion
for
so
much
as
thinking
of
tozer
that
was
provided
for
with
the
freest
conscience
in
the
world
he
might
put
it
out
of
his
mind
but
how
he
could
feel
this
so
strongly
and
at
the
same
time
revel
in
the
consciousness
of
a
fuller
purse
more
to
enjoy
and
more
to
spend
is
a
mystery
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
solve
he
did
so
and
many
others
have
done
so
besides
him
eating
their
cake
yet
believing
that
they
had
their
cake
with
the
fullest
confidence
he
was
a
sensible
man
rather
priding
himself
on
his
knowledge
of
business
with
much
experience
in
human
nature
and
a
thoughtful
sense
fully
evidenced
in
his
writings
of
all
the
strange
inconsistencies
and
of
mankind
but
he
dropped
into
this
strain
of
with
the
calmest
satisfaction
of
mind
and
was
as
sure
of
his
own
good
sense
and
kindness
as
if
he
had
never
in
all
his
life
taken
a
step
out
of
the
rigidest
of
the
narrow
ways
of
uprightness
some
part
of
this
illusion
however
was
sharply
dispelled
at
a
very
early
date
clarence
copperhead
who
was
not
likely
to
err
by
means
of
too
much
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
others
grumbled
frankly
at
the
meal
i
do
understand
a
two
dinner
he
said
it
lunch
what
i
call
it
and
i
wo
be
disagreeable
about
the
kids
but
i
must
have
my
dinner
bless
you
a
man
ca
live
without
his
dinner
what
is
he
to
do
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
you
can
look
forward
to
whatever
happens
if
it
a
wet
day
or
anything
of
that
sort
there
always
dinner
and
after
it
over
if
there
music
or
a
rubber
why
all
very
well
or
if
a
man
feels
a
bit
sleepy
it
does
matter
why
dinner
your
wherever
you
are
i
as
soon
do
without
my
head
for
my
part
ursula
hastened
to
tell
her
father
this
with
dismay
in
her
looks
i
always
heard
that
late
dinners
were
so
expensive
you
require
twice
as
many
dishes
at
two
one
has
only
what
is
necessary
but
at
seven
you
require
to
have
fish
and
soup
and
and
all
sorts
of
things
besides
the
joint
it
was
disgraceful
of
him
to
say
it
cried
ursula
and
i
think
he
ought
to
be
made
to
follow
our
plan
whatever
it
is
and
not
do
everything
he
likes
here
that
is
all
very
true
said
may
but
he
is
right
about
the
dinner
it
is
a
great
deal
more
agreeable
and
expensive
papa
well
perhaps
it
is
a
great
deal
to
expect
at
your
age
but
if
you
read
your
as
i
have
often
said
when
you
were
reading
those
novels
and
learned
how
to
toss
up
little
dishes
out
of
nothing
and
make
and
so
forth
at
next
to
no
expense
the
tears
came
into
ursula
eyes
at
this
unjust
assault
papa
she
said
you
ought
to
know
better
at
your
age
one
forgives
the
boys
for
saying
such
silly
things
how
can
i
toss
up
little
dishes
out
of
nothing
if
you
only
knew
the
price
of
butter
not
to
talk
of
anything
else
made
dishes
are
the
most
expensive
things
a
leg
of
mutton
for
instance
there
it
is
and
when
one
weighs
it
one
knows
what
it
costs
but
there
is
not
one
of
those
but
costs
for
herbs
and
truffles
and
gravy
and
forcemeat
and
a
glass
of
white
wine
here
and
a
half
pint
of
claret
there
it
is
all
very
well
to
talk
of
dishes
made
out
of
nothing
the
meat
may
not
be
very
much
and
men
never
think
of
the
other
things
i
suppose
it
is
management
that
is
wanted
said
may
to
throw
nothing
away
to
make
use
of
everything
to
employ
all
your
scraps
if
you
once
have
a
good
sauce
which
is
as
easy
as
daylight
when
you
take
the
trouble
you
can
make
all
sorts
of
things
out
of
a
cold
joint
but
women
never
will
take
the
trouble
and
that
is
the
secret
of
poor
dinners
not
one
in
fifty
will
do
it
if
you
wanted
really
to
help
us
and
improve
my
position
you
might
ursula
i
ca
afford
to
fall
out
with
copperhead
he
is
very
important
to
me
just
at
this
moment
and
perhaps
it
is
better
that
i
should
give
in
to
him
at
once
about
the
late
dinner
you
may
say
it
is
not
my
business
said
ursula
but
we
have
already
another
maid
and
now
two
dinners
for
it
is
just
the
same
as
two
dinners
he
will
not
be
any
advantage
to
you
like
that
and
why
should
he
be
so
much
harder
to
please
than
we
are
reginald
never
grumbled
who
was
much
better
bred
and
better
educated
than
mr
copperhead
and
with
so
much
money
to
keep
up
his
dignity
said
her
father
mockingly
no
it
is
not
your
business
the
is
your
business
and
how
to
make
the
best
of
everything
otherwise
i
do
want
any
advice
from
you
what
did
he
say
cried
janey
rushing
in
as
soon
as
her
father
had
left
the
room
ursula
a
very
general
consequence
of
such
interviews
was
sitting
by
the
fire
very
red
and
excited
with
tears
glistening
in
her
eyes
of
course
i
knew
what
he
would
say
he
says
it
is
not
my
business
and
there
are
to
be
late
dinners
and
everything
that
man
chooses
to
ask
for
oh
it
is
so
hard
to
put
up
with
it
cried
ursula
her
eyes
flashing
through
her
tears
i
am
to
read
up
the
and
learn
to
make
for
them
but
to
say
we
ca
afford
it
is
not
my
business
i
wonder
whose
business
it
is
it
is
i
who
have
to
go
to
the
tradespeople
and
to
bear
it
all
if
they
grumble
and
now
this
horrible
man
who
dares
to
tell
me
the
coffee
is
not
strong
enough
as
if
i
was
a
barmaid
barmaids
do
have
to
do
with
coffee
have
they
said
janey
but
the
fact
is
is
not
a
why
should
you
mind
what
does
it
matter
what
a
person
like
that
says
or
does
you
said
so
yourself
he
is
not
a
bit
a
gentleman
i
wonder
what
cousin
anne
and
cousin
sophy
could
mean
it
is
not
their
fault
they
think
of
his
mother
who
is
nice
who
sent
those
things
but
copperhead
knew
about
the
things
which
was
not
so
nice
of
her
was
it
but
never
mind
we
must
try
to
make
the
best
of
it
get
the
janey
perhaps
if
you
were
to
read
it
out
loud
and
we
were
both
to
try
to
fix
our
mind
upon
it
for
something
must
be
done
said
ursula
gravely
papa
will
never
find
it
out
till
all
the
money
is
spent
but
we
shall
be
poorer
than
we
were
before
we
had
the
pupil
who
is
that
janey
at
the
door
it
was
phoebe
who
came
in
blooming
from
the
cold
in
a
furred
jacket
at
which
the
girls
looked
with
unfeigned
admiration
the
skating
will
soon
come
on
in
earnest
now
she
said
grandmamma
is
better
and
i
thought
i
might
come
and
see
you
i
had
a
long
talk
with
your
brother
the
other
day
did
he
tell
you
and
i
made
him
know
northcote
one
of
our
people
i
know
you
will
turn
up
your
pretty
nose
ursula
at
a
dissenter
i
should
think
so
cried
janey
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
people
being
gentlefolks
have
we
ursula
oh
i
forgot
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
mean
to
say
phoebe
smiled
upon
her
serenely
i
am
not
angry
she
said
i
understand
all
that
and
in
carlingford
i
have
no
right
i
suppose
to
stand
upon
being
a
lady
though
i
always
thought
i
was
one
i
am
only
a
young
woman
here
and
not
so
bad
either
for
that
if
you
will
promise
janey
not
to
call
me
a
young
person
oh
miss
beecham
copperhead
is
a
dissenter
said
ursula
somewhat
sullenly
we
put
up
with
him
because
he
is
rich
oh
it
is
all
very
disagreeable
i
want
to
know
any
new
people
whatever
they
are
i
find
the
old
ones
bad
enough
reginald
hates
him
too
a
big
lazy
useless
being
that
treats
one
as
if
one
were
a
chambermaid
is
it
clarence
it
is
not
quite
his
fault
his
mother
is
a
lady
but
his
father
is
a
brute
said
phoebe
thinking
of
nothing
but
his
horrible
money
clarence
is
not
so
bad
it
is
because
he
has
no
imagination
and
does
not
understand
other
people
feelings
he
does
not
mean
it
poor
fellow
he
goes
trampling
about
with
his
big
feet
upon
everybody
toes
and
never
is
a
bit
the
wiser
here
he
is
he
is
coming
in
with
your
father
i
suppose
there
must
be
a
great
deal
in
race
she
added
with
a
soft
little
sigh
clarence
looks
a
clown
and
your
father
such
a
gentleman
i
suppose
i
show
just
the
same
when
i
stand
beside
you
now
phoebe
was
well
aware
that
this
was
not
the
case
and
indignant
disclaimer
made
her
rather
laugh
because
it
was
so
unnecessary
than
be
pleased
by
its
vehemence
there
was
an
old
convex
mirror
opposite
which
reflected
the
girls
in
miniature
making
a
pretty
picture
of
them
as
they
sat
together
ursula
with
her
dark
locks
and
phoebe
in
her
golden
hair
and
the
tall
sharp
janey
all
elbows
and
angles
short
petticoats
and
grey
stockings
janey
was
the
only
one
in
whom
there
could
have
been
suspected
any
inferiority
of
race
but
her
awkwardness
was
that
of
youth
and
her
disordered
hair
and
dress
belonged
also
to
her
age
for
she
was
at
that
troublesome
period
when
frocks
are
constantly
getting
too
short
and
sleeves
too
scanty
janey
was
shuffling
slowly
round
the
visitor
admiring
her
at
every
point
her
garments
were
not
made
as
dresses
were
made
in
carlingford
their
fit
and
their
texture
were
alike
too
perfect
for
anything
that
ever
came
out
of
high
street
the
furred
jacket
had
not
been
seen
in
grange
lane
before
perhaps
it
was
because
the
cold
had
become
more
severe
an
ordinary
and
simple
reason
or
because
clarence
copperhead
who
knew
her
and
in
whose
eyes
it
was
important
to
bate
no
jot
of
her
social
pretensions
was
here
and
the
furred
jacket
was
beyond
comparison
with
anything
that
had
been
seen
for
ages
in
carlingford
the
deep
border
of
fur
round
the
velvet
the
warm
waddings
and
paddings
the
close
fit
up
to
the
throat
were
excellencies
which
warranted
tour
of
inspection
phoebe
perceived
it
very
well
but
did
not
confuse
the
girl
by
taking
any
notice
and
in
her
heart
she
was
herself
slightly
wondering
as
ursula
had
done
what
the
man
had
come
here
for
and
what
he
would
say
when
he
saw
her
both
of
these
young
women
had
a
secret
belief
that
something
romantic
something
more
than
the
mere
prose
of
reading
in
the
first
tutor
house
that
happened
to
have
been
suggested
to
him
had
brought
young
copperhead
to
such
an
unlikely
place
as
carlingford
ursula
had
by
this
time
learned
to
reject
this
hypothesis
with
much
indignation
at
herself
for
having
entertained
it
but
phoebe
still
felt
slightly
fluttered
by
this
possibility
and
was
eager
for
the
entrance
of
clarence
she
would
know
at
once
what
had
brought
him
she
said
to
herself
the
moment
she
caught
his
eye
and
though
may
had
reconciled
himself
so
completely
to
the
tozer
business
the
appearance
of
tozer
granddaughter
gave
him
a
momentary
shock
what
did
you
do
with
my
grandfather
letter
he
thought
her
eyes
said
and
the
meeting
confused
and
disturbed
him
this
however
was
only
for
a
moment
he
was
a
man
to
whom
it
was
always
possible
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
women
and
though
he
felt
so
easy
in
his
mind
about
tozer
still
it
was
evident
that
to
conciliate
tozer
relation
and
that
so
influential
a
relation
was
on
the
whole
a
good
thing
to
do
he
was
going
up
to
her
accordingly
with
outstretched
hands
and
the
most
amiable
inquiries
about
her
grandmother
health
when
to
his
surprise
he
was
frustrated
by
clarence
who
had
come
in
before
him
his
large
person
swelling
out
as
it
always
seemed
to
do
when
he
presented
himself
upon
a
new
scene
with
importance
and
grandeur
miss
beecham
he
said
really
who
would
have
thought
it
now
look
here
i
came
to
carlingford
thinking
there
was
not
a
soul
i
knew
in
the
place
and
here
have
you
turned
up
all
at
once
and
northcote
you
know
northcote
it
is
very
queer
it
is
odd
is
it
said
phoebe
quickly
i
was
astonished
to
see
northcote
and
though
i
heard
you
were
coming
i
am
not
less
surprised
to
see
you
he
has
not
come
for
me
she
said
rapidly
to
herself
nor
for
ursula
either
then
who
is
it
phoebe
demanded
in
the
depths
of
her
own
bosom
that
he
should
have
come
for
nobody
at
all
but
simply
for
his
own
purposes
to
get
a
little
information
put
into
his
head
seemed
incredible
to
both
the
girls
ursula
for
her
part
had
been
angry
when
she
discovered
his
want
of
meaning
though
why
she
would
have
found
it
hard
to
say
but
phoebe
for
her
part
was
not
angry
she
took
this
like
other
things
of
the
kind
with
great
and
most
philosophical
calm
but
she
could
not
outgrow
it
all
at
once
for
whom
was
it
his
cousins
those
miss
dorsets
but
they
were
much
older
and
not
the
kind
of
women
for
whom
such
an
act
was
likely
her
mind
wandered
forth
lively
and
curious
in
search
of
the
necessary
clue
she
could
not
consent
to
the
fact
that
no
clue
was
necessary
where
no
mystery
was
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
venture
out
in
this
wintry
weather
said
may
you
set
us
all
a
good
example
i
am
always
telling
my
girls
that
cold
weather
is
no
sufficient
reason
for
staying
indoors
i
wish
ursula
would
do
as
you
do
papa
how
can
you
talk
so
said
janey
indignant
when
you
know
very
well
it
is
not
the
cold
that
keeps
ursula
in
but
because
she
has
so
much
to
do
oh
yes
one
knows
the
sort
of
things
young
ladies
have
to
do
said
clarence
with
a
laugh
read
stories
and
look
up
pretty
dresses
for
their
parties
eh
miss
janey
and
consult
the
oh
of
course
you
will
deny
it
but
my
mother
makes
me
her
confidant
and
i
know
that
what
you
all
do
to
be
sure
said
phoebe
we
are
not
so
clever
as
you
are
and
ca
do
so
many
things
we
know
no
latin
or
greek
to
keep
our
minds
instructed
we
acknowledge
our
infirmity
and
we
could
play
football
to
save
our
lives
football
is
what
you
do
in
this
season
when
you
do
hunt
and
before
the
ice
is
bearing
we
are
poor
creatures
we
ca
parcel
out
our
lives
according
as
it
is
time
for
football
or
cricket
you
must
not
be
so
severe
upon
girls
for
being
so
inferior
to
you
oh
do
be
too
hard
upon
him
whispered
ursula
in
a
parenthesis
afraid
that
this
irony
should
drive
the
pupil
to
desperation
hard
upon
him
he
will
never
find
it
out
phoebe
whispered
back
in
the
same
tone
oh
hang
it
all
i
do
mean
to
be
severe
upon
girls
said
clarence
pulling
his
moustache
with
much
complacency
i
am
sorry
for
them
i
can
tell
you
it
ai
their
fault
i
know
heaps
of
nice
girls
who
feel
it
horribly
what
can
they
do
they
ca
go
in
for
cricket
and
football
there
ought
to
be
something
invented
for
them
to
be
sure
there
is
but
that
only
for
summer
i
should
go
mad
i
think
if
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
you
have
more
brain
and
more
strength
you
see
than
we
have
and
besides
we
are
used
to
it
said
phoebe
i
am
afraid
ursula
grandmamma
will
want
me
and
i
must
go
here
may
said
something
to
his
daughter
which
filled
ursula
with
excitement
mingled
of
pleasure
and
displeasure
papa
says
will
you
come
to
dinner
at
seven
it
appears
there
is
some
one
you
know
coming
a
northcote
i
do
know
who
he
is
but
it
will
be
very
kind
if
you
will
come
on
my
account
the
girl
concluded
whispering
in
her
ear
for
how
shall
i
ever
get
through
a
we
never
gave
one
in
my
life
before
of
course
i
will
come
said
phoebe
are
not
so
common
here
that
i
should
neglect
the
chance
i
must
thank
may
but
i
hope
you
know
who
northcote
is
she
added
laughing
i
gave
an
account
of
myself
loyally
before
i
permitted
you
to
ask
me
but
northcote
oh
no
he
does
not
belong
to
the
lower
classes
but
he
is
a
fiery
what
cried
eager
janey
pressing
to
the
front
radical
i
am
a
radical
too
and
reginald
used
to
be
once
and
so
was
ursula
oh
i
wish
it
was
said
janey
clasping
her
hands
not
a
radical
but
a
dissenter
and
you
who
are
a
clergyman
may
i
like
you
oh
so
much
for
it
but
i
wonder
what
the
people
will
say
my
dear
miss
beecham
said
the
suave
churchman
quite
ready
to
seize
the
chance
of
making
a
point
for
himself
in
the
church
fortunately
what
the
people
say
has
not
to
be
studied
as
your
unfortunate
pastors
i
am
informed
have
to
do
while
copperhead
is
under
my
roof
i
make
his
friends
welcome
for
his
sake
first
probably
afterwards
for
their
own
yes
i
asked
northcote
said
clarence
i
never
thought
they
would
have
any
objection
he
not
a
common
dissenter
like
the
most
of
those
fellows
that
have
nothing
but
their
salaries
he
well
off
he
require
bless
you
to
keep
people
in
good
temper
and
toady
to
like
most
do
he
as
independent
as
i
am
i
do
say
that
he
quite
as
well
off
but
money
always
finds
its
level
i
should
have
thought
of
asking
may
to
receive
a
common
dissenting
fellow
like
the
rest
phoebe
laughed
it
did
not
occur
to
the
accomplished
scion
of
the
house
of
copperhead
nor
to
the
two
girls
who
were
not
experienced
enough
to
think
of
such
things
what
was
the
meaning
expressed
in
phoebe
laugh
which
was
not
cheerful
may
himself
had
the
advantage
of
more
discrimination
i
hope
you
will
find
that
dissenter
or
not
i
know
what
is
my
duty
to
my
friends
he
said
what
my
guests
may
possess
or
the
exact
nature
of
their
opinions
on
all
points
are
not
subjects
to
be
discussed
by
me
oh
there
is
nothing
to
find
fault
with
in
said
phoebe
with
less
than
her
usual
universal
courtesy
you
are
always
kind
may
and
then
she
laughed
again
some
people
are
very
clever
in
finding
out
the
vulnerable
places
she
said
she
is
changed
said
clarence
when
she
was
gone
she
is
not
the
jolly
girl
she
used
to
be
she
was
always
a
very
jolly
girl
ready
to
help
a
fellow
out
of
a
scrape
you
know
but
northcote
a
fearfully
clever
fellow
you
should
just
hear
him
talk
he
and
may
will
go
at
it
hammer
and
tongs
as
sure
as
fate
chapter
xxix
ursula
entrées
it
would
be
difficult
to
describe
the
anxiety
with
which
that
first
late
dinner
was
regarded
by
ursula
janey
too
had
thrown
herself
into
it
heart
and
soul
until
she
received
the
crushing
intimation
from
her
father
that
her
company
was
not
expected
at
this
stately
meal
a
discovery
which
altogether
extinguished
poor
janey
accustomed
to
be
always
in
the
front
whatever
occurred
and
to
whom
suggestions
of
things
that
could
not
be
done
by
a
girl
who
was
not
out
had
never
presented
themselves
she
retired
to
her
own
room
dissolved
in
tears
when
this
fearful
mandate
went
forth
and
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
was
good
for
nothing
her
eyes
being
converted
into
a
sort
of
red
pulp
her
rough
hair
doubly
dishevelled
her
whole
being
run
into
tears
she
was
of
no
more
use
now
to
go
errands
between
the
kitchen
and
the
or
to
read
the
out
loud
which
was
a
process
upon
which
ursula
depended
very
much
to
fix
in
her
mind
the
exact
ingredients
and
painful
method
of
preparation
of
the
at
which
she
was
toiling
betsy
the
former
now
promoted
under
the
title
of
cook
could
be
trusted
to
roast
the
saddle
of
mutton
which
on
consideration
that
it
was
a
party
had
been
thought
preferable
to
a
leg
and
she
could
boil
the
fish
after
a
sort
and
make
good
honest
family
soup
and
the
or
which
was
the
nearest
approach
to
luxury
indulged
in
at
the
parsonage
but
as
for
betsy
did
not
know
what
they
were
she
had
heard
of
made
dishes
indeed
and
respectfully
afar
off
had
seen
them
when
she
was
at
lady
weston
the
golden
age
of
her
youthful
inexperience
but
this
was
so
long
ago
that
her
recollections
were
rather
confusing
than
useful
to
ursula
when
she
went
downstairs
to
make
her
first
heroic
effort
la
miss
that
ai
how
cook
used
to
do
at
lady
weston
betsy
said
looking
on
with
unbelieving
eyes
she
was
sure
of
this
negative
but
she
was
not
sure
of
anything
else
and
utterly
failed
to
give
any
active
assistance
after
driving
the
girl
desperate
with
her
criticisms
altogether
it
was
a
confused
and
unpleasant
day
when
reginald
came
in
in
the
morning
his
sister
had
no
time
to
speak
to
him
so
anxious
was
she
and
and
the
was
being
turned
upside
down
to
make
it
look
more
modern
more
elegant
more
like
the
which
was
the
only
one
ursula
knew
the
comfortable
round
table
in
the
middle
round
which
the
family
had
grouped
themselves
for
so
long
had
been
pushed
aside
into
a
corner
leaving
one
fresh
patch
of
carpet
quite
inappropriate
and
unconnected
with
anything
else
and
instead
of
the
work
and
the
which
so
often
intruded
there
all
that
was
gaudy
and
uninteresting
in
the
may
library
had
been
produced
to
decorate
the
table
and
even
a
case
of
wax
flowers
a
production
of
thirty
years
since
which
had
been
respectfully
transferred
to
a
china
closet
by
ursula
better
taste
but
which
in
the
dearth
of
ornament
she
had
brought
back
again
reginald
carried
off
the
wax
flowers
and
replaced
the
table
with
his
own
hands
while
ursula
scorched
her
cheeks
over
the
downstairs
all
this
for
northcote
he
said
when
she
ran
up
for
a
moment
done
up
in
a
big
white
apron
her
face
crimson
with
the
fire
and
anxiety
combined
for
miss
beecham
has
been
here
before
and
you
made
no
fuss
about
her
then
she
came
to
tea
said
ursula
and
i
got
a
cake
which
was
all
any
one
could
do
but
a
dinner
is
a
very
different
thing
indeed
she
had
by
this
time
come
to
share
her
father
opinion
that
dinner
was
the
right
and
dignified
thing
in
all
cases
and
that
they
had
been
hitherto
living
in
a
very
way
the
dinner
had
gone
to
her
head
then
it
is
for
northcote
as
i
say
said
reginald
do
you
know
who
he
is
a
dissenter
said
ursula
with
a
certain
languor
but
so
you
know
is
copperhead
and
he
is
the
chief
person
here
papa
thinks
there
is
nobody
like
him
and
so
is
phoebe
oh
have
you
come
so
far
as
that
said
reginald
with
a
little
tinge
of
colour
in
his
face
he
laughed
but
the
name
moved
him
it
is
a
pretty
fresh
sort
of
country
name
not
quite
like
such
an
accomplished
person
oh
that
is
just
like
you
men
with
your
injustice
because
she
is
clever
you
take
it
amiss
you
are
all
jealous
of
her
look
at
her
pretty
colour
and
her
beautiful
hair
if
that
is
not
fresh
i
should
like
to
know
what
is
she
might
be
hebe
instead
of
phoebe
said
ursula
who
had
picked
up
scraps
of
classical
knowledge
in
spite
of
herself
you
are
a
little
goose
said
reginald
pinching
her
ear
but
he
liked
his
sister
for
her
generous
partizanship
mind
you
do
come
to
dinner
with
cheeks
like
that
he
said
i
like
my
sister
to
be
herself
not
a
and
i
do
believe
in
but
he
went
away
smiling
and
with
a
certain
warmth
in
his
breast
he
had
gone
up
and
down
grange
lane
many
times
at
the
hour
of
sunset
hoping
to
meet
phoebe
again
but
that
sensible
young
woman
had
no
mind
to
be
talked
of
and
never
appeared
except
when
she
was
certain
the
road
was
clear
this
had
tantalized
reginald
more
than
he
chose
to
avow
even
to
himself
pride
prevented
him
from
knocking
at
the
closed
door
the
old
tozers
were
fearful
people
to
encounter
people
whom
to
visit
would
be
to
damn
himself
in
carlingford
but
then
the
miss
griffiths
were
very
insipid
by
the
side
of
phoebe
and
the
variety
of
her
talk
though
he
had
seen
so
little
of
her
seemed
to
have
created
a
new
want
in
his
life
he
thought
of
a
hundred
things
which
he
should
like
to
discuss
with
her
things
which
did
not
interest
ursula
and
which
the
people
about
him
did
not
understand
much
society
at
that
time
as
may
be
presumed
was
in
a
poor
way
in
carlingford
the
wentworths
and
wodehouses
were
gone
and
many
other
nice
people
the
houses
in
grange
lane
were
getting
deserted
or
falling
into
inferior
hands
as
was
apparent
by
the
fact
that
the
tozers
old
tozer
the
butterman
had
got
one
of
them
the
other
people
were
mostly
relics
of
a
bygone
state
of
things
retired
old
couples
old
ladies
spinsters
and
widows
excellent
people
but
not
lively
to
talk
to
and
the
griffiths
above
mentioned
put
up
with
in
consideration
of
tolerable
good
looks
and
fun
became
tiresome
when
anything
better
was
to
be
had
the
mere
apparition
of
phoebe
upon
the
horizon
had
been
enough
to
show
reginald
that
there
were
other
kinds
of
human
beings
in
the
world
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
and
the
idea
of
the
social
suicide
implied
in
marrying
old
granddaughter
had
not
so
much
as
once
entered
his
imagination
had
he
thought
of
it
he
would
have
pulled
that
imagination
up
tight
like
an
unruly
horse
the
thing
being
too
impossible
to
bear
thinking
of
but
this
had
never
entered
his
mind
he
wanted
to
see
phoebe
to
talk
to
her
to
be
near
her
as
something
very
new
captivating
and
full
of
interest
that
was
all
no
one
else
within
his
sphere
could
talk
so
well
the
rector
was
very
great
indeed
on
the
reredos
question
and
the
necessity
of
reviving
the
disused
church
customs
but
reginald
could
not
go
so
far
as
he
did
as
to
the
importance
of
the
reredos
and
was
quite
in
doubt
whether
it
was
not
as
well
for
most
people
to
direct
themselves
by
their
own
consciences
as
to
be
directed
by
the
spiritual
head
of
the
parish
who
was
not
over
wise
in
his
own
concerns
his
father
reginald
knew
could
be
very
agreeable
among
strangers
but
he
seldom
chose
to
be
so
in
his
own
house
all
this
made
the
advent
of
phoebe
appear
to
him
like
a
sudden
revelation
out
of
a
different
world
he
was
an
oxford
man
with
the
best
of
education
but
he
was
a
simpleton
all
the
same
he
thought
he
saw
in
her
an
evidence
of
what
life
was
like
in
those
intellectual
professional
circles
which
a
man
may
hope
to
get
into
only
in
london
it
was
not
the
world
of
fashion
he
was
aware
but
he
thought
in
his
simplicity
that
it
was
the
still
higher
world
of
culture
and
knowledge
in
which
genius
and
wit
and
intellect
stood
instead
of
rank
or
riches
how
tozer
granddaughter
had
got
admission
there
he
did
not
ask
himself
but
this
was
what
he
thought
and
to
talk
to
her
was
a
new
sensation
he
was
quite
unconscious
of
anything
more
nobody
knew
when
ursula
took
her
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
in
her
pretty
white
dress
which
she
had
worn
at
the
dorsets
how
much
toil
and
anxiety
the
preparations
had
given
her
at
the
last
moment
when
her
mind
was
so
far
clear
of
the
as
clear
as
the
mind
of
an
inexperienced
can
be
until
the
blessed
moment
when
they
are
eaten
and
done
with
she
had
to
take
sarah
in
hand
who
was
not
very
clear
about
the
waiting
and
to
instruct
her
according
to
her
own
very
imperfect
knowledge
how
to
fulfil
her
duties
think
it
is
not
a
at
all
but
only
just
our
ordinary
luncheon
and
do
get
fluttered
and
when
i
look
at
you
like
come
quite
close
and
i
will
whisper
what
you
are
to
do
and
oh
sarah
like
a
good
creature
do
break
anything
said
ursula
almost
with
tears
these
were
all
the
directions
she
could
give
and
they
it
must
be
allowed
were
somewhat
vague
the
excitement
was
becoming
to
her
she
sat
down
with
a
dreadful
flutter
in
her
heart
but
with
her
eyes
shining
and
sparkling
clarence
copperhead
who
extended
an
arm
very
carelessly
to
take
her
downstairs
absolutely
certain
of
being
a
more
important
person
than
his
guest
northcote
was
roused
for
the
first
time
to
the
consciousness
that
she
was
very
pretty
which
he
had
not
found
out
before
but
no
style
he
said
to
himself
phoebe
was
the
one
who
had
style
she
sat
between
may
and
the
stranger
but
devoted
herself
to
her
host
chiefly
displaying
a
gentle
contempt
of
the
younger
men
in
his
presence
no
anxiety
was
in
her
mind
about
the
dinner
she
did
not
follow
the
fate
of
those
round
the
table
with
terrible
palpitations
as
poor
ursula
did
and
alas
the
were
not
good
and
ursula
had
the
mortification
to
see
the
dishes
she
had
taken
so
much
trouble
with
rejected
by
one
and
another
reginald
ate
some
for
which
she
blessed
him
and
so
did
phoebe
but
may
sent
his
plate
away
with
polite
execrations
tell
your
cook
she
shall
go
if
she
sends
up
such
uneatable
stuff
again
ursula
her
father
cried
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
two
big
tears
dashed
up
hot
and
scalding
into
ursula
eyes
oh
how
she
wished
she
could
be
dismissed
like
betsy
she
turned
those
two
little
oceans
of
trouble
piteously
without
knowing
it
upon
northcote
who
had
said
something
to
her
without
being
able
to
reply
to
him
and
northcote
who
was
but
a
young
man
though
he
was
a
fiery
political
dissenter
and
who
had
come
to
the
parsonage
with
a
curious
mixture
of
pleasure
and
reluctance
immediately
threw
down
any
arms
that
nature
might
have
provided
him
with
and
fell
in
love
with
her
there
and
then
on
the
spot
to
his
own
absolute
consternation
this
was
how
it
happened
the
moment
was
not
romantic
the
situation
was
not
sublime
a
little
motherless
housekeeper
crying
because
her
father
scolded
her
in
public
for
a
piece
of
bad
cookery
there
is
nothing
in
this
to
make
an
idyll
out
of
but
such
as
it
was
it
proved
enough
for
horace
northcote
he
yielded
himself
on
the
spot
not
a
word
was
said
for
ursula
felt
that
if
she
tried
to
talk
she
must
cry
and
anything
further
from
her
troubled
thoughts
than
love
it
would
be
impossible
to
imagine
but
then
and
there
so
far
as
the
young
man
was
concerned
the
story
began
he
talked
very
little
for
the
rest
of
the
meal
and
ursula
did
not
exert
herself
though
she
recovered
slightly
when
the
mutton
turned
out
to
be
very
good
and
was
commended
but
what
was
the
mutton
in
comparison
with
her
which
she
had
made
with
her
own
hands
and
which
were
a
failure
she
was
reduced
to
silence
and
she
thought
that
the
stranger
at
her
left
hand
was
nice
because
he
did
not
bother
her
and
was
content
with
a
very
little
talk
oh
phoebe
did
you
hear
papa
about
those
she
cried
when
they
reached
the
and
sitting
down
on
the
stool
by
the
fire
which
janey
usually
appropriated
she
cried
poor
child
with
undisguised
passion
i
had
made
them
myself
i
had
been
busy
about
them
all
day
i
read
the
till
my
head
ached
and
took
such
pains
and
you
heard
what
he
said
yes
dear
i
heard
him
but
he
did
not
think
what
he
was
saying
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
you
do
shake
your
little
head
i
am
sure
of
it
you
know
ursula
your
papa
is
very
agreeable
and
very
clever
yes
i
know
he
is
clever
and
he
can
be
nice
when
he
likes
did
you
like
it
cried
janey
bursting
in
and
dishevelled
in
her
morning
frock
oh
no
i
am
not
dressed
i
do
mean
to
to
let
him
get
the
better
of
me
and
think
i
care
only
just
for
a
moment
to
see
you
two
oh
is
phoebe
grand
in
that
dress
she
is
like
a
picture
you
are
nothing
beside
her
ursula
tell
me
is
it
nice
to
have
dinner
instead
of
tea
did
it
go
off
very
well
did
you
enjoy
yourselves
or
were
you
all
unhappy
sitting
round
the
table
eating
beef
and
mutton
cried
janey
with
all
the
scorn
of
ignorance
at
that
ridiculous
hour
i
was
as
miserable
as
i
could
be
cried
ursula
i
was
not
happy
at
all
enjoy
myself
with
the
on
my
mind
and
after
what
papa
said
oh
run
away
janey
and
dress
or
else
go
to
bed
papa
will
be
so
angry
if
he
comes
up
and
finds
you
here
i
should
like
to
make
him
frantic
cried
janey
with
vindictive
force
i
should
just
like
to
drive
him
out
of
his
senses
never
mind
yes
i
am
angry
have
i
a
right
to
be
angry
i
am
as
tall
as
ursula
i
hope
i
know
how
to
behave
myself
and
when
there
were
people
coming
and
a
real
dinner
oh
i
hear
them
cried
ursula
in
alarm
and
janey
flew
off
her
hair
streaming
behind
her
phoebe
put
her
arm
round
ursula
and
raised
her
from
the
stool
she
was
not
perhaps
a
perfect
young
woman
but
had
her
own
ends
to
serve
like
other
people
yet
she
had
a
friendly
soul
she
gave
her
friend
a
kiss
to
preface
her
admonition
as
girls
have
a
way
of
doing
i
would
not
let
janey
talk
so
she
said
i
think
you
should
not
talk
so
yourself
ursula
if
you
will
forgive
me
of
your
papa
he
is
very
nice
and
so
clever
i
should
try
all
i
could
to
please
him
and
i
should
not
let
any
one
be
disrespectful
to
him
if
it
was
i
oh
phoebe
if
you
only
knew
yes
i
know
gentlemen
do
understand
often
but
we
must
do
our
duty
he
is
nice
and
clever
and
handsome
and
you
ought
to
be
proud
of
him
dry
your
eyes
here
they
are
really
coming
upstairs
you
must
be
and
talk
he
is
ever
so
much
nicer
than
the
young
men
said
phoebe
almost
loud
enough
to
be
heard
as
clarence
copperhead
sauntering
in
advance
of
the
others
with
his
large
fully
displayed
came
into
the
room
he
came
in
half
whistling
in
serene
indifference
phoebe
had
style
it
was
true
but
she
was
only
a
dissenting
parson
daughter
and
what
were
two
such
girls
to
clarence
copperhead
he
came
in
whistling
an
opera
air
which
he
let
drop
only
after
he
was
well
inside
the
door
miss
beecham
let
us
have
some
music
i
know
you
can
play
he
said
if
miss
may
likes
said
phoebe
covering
his
rudeness
and
then
she
laughed
and
added
if
you
will
accompany
me
does
copperhead
play
too
oh
beautifully
has
he
not
let
you
see
his
music
wo
you
bring
it
here
and
let
us
look
over
it
i
dare
say
there
are
some
things
we
can
play
together
you
can
play
everything
said
the
young
man
and
i
bring
my
violin
if
you
like
he
was
delighted
he
quickened
his
steps
almost
into
a
run
as
he
went
away
you
should
not
laugh
at
copperhead
ursula
retorted
on
her
friend
you
should
be
too
you
are
better
than
i
am
but
you
are
not
quite
good
after
all
violin
said
may
heaven
and
earth
is
there
going
to
be
any
fiddling
miss
beecham
i
did
not
expect
you
to
bring
such
a
horror
upon
me
i
thought
i
had
nothing
but
good
to
expect
from
you
wait
till
you
hear
him
sir
said
phoebe
may
retired
to
the
far
corner
of
the
room
he
called
young
northcote
to
him
who
was
standing
beside
ursula
eager
to
talk
but
not
knowing
how
to
begin
it
was
bad
enough
to
be
thus
withdrawn
from
his
chance
of
making
himself
agreeable
but
the
reader
may
imagine
what
was
the
dissenter
feelings
when
may
with
a
smile
turned
upon
him
having
given
him
a
tolerably
good
dinner
and
lulled
him
into
a
belief
that
his
sins
against
the
family
were
unknown
he
looked
at
him
smiling
and
began
northcote
the
first
time
i
saw
you
you
were
discoursing
at
an
meeting
in
the
town
hall
northcote
started
he
blushed
fiery
red
it
is
quite
true
i
wished
to
have
told
you
not
to
come
here
on
false
pretences
but
copperhead
and
your
son
has
been
very
kind
then
i
suppose
your
views
are
modified
clergymen
no
longer
appear
to
you
the
demons
in
human
shape
you
thought
them
then
and
my
son
in
particular
has
lost
his
horns
and
hoofs
may
you
are
very
severe
but
i
own
there
is
reason
it
was
you
who
were
severe
i
was
not
quite
sure
of
you
till
copperhead
brought
you
in
nay
said
the
clergyman
rubbing
his
hands
do
you
think
that
i
object
to
the
utterance
of
a
real
opinion
certainly
not
as
for
reginald
it
was
the
thing
that
decided
him
i
leave
you
to
find
out
how
so
that
we
are
positively
in
your
debt
but
i
hope
you
fiddle
too
if
you
like
to
come
with
me
to
my
study
northcote
gave
a
longing
look
round
the
room
which
had
become
all
at
once
so
interesting
to
him
may
was
too
not
to
see
it
he
thought
quite
impartially
that
perhaps
it
was
an
excusable
weakness
even
though
it
was
his
own
society
that
was
the
counter
attraction
they
were
two
girls
this
was
how
he
put
it
being
no
longer
young
and
father
to
one
of
them
naturally
the
two
young
men
would
have
described
the
attraction
of
phoebe
and
ursula
more
warmly
clarence
copperhead
who
had
come
in
with
an
armful
of
music
and
his
fiddle
was
not
thinking
of
the
girls
nor
of
anything
but
the
sweet
sounds
he
was
about
to
make
and
himself
when
he
began
to
tune
his
violin
may
got
up
in
dismay
this
is
more
than
mortal
can
stand
he
said
making
as
though
he
would
have
gone
away
then
he
changed
his
mind
for
after
all
he
was
the
chaperon
of
his
motherless
girl
get
me
the
paper
ursula
he
said
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
with
what
feelings
northcote
contemplated
him
he
was
the
father
of
ursula
yet
he
dared
to
order
her
about
to
bring
the
tears
to
her
eyes
northcote
darted
the
same
way
as
she
was
going
and
caught
at
the
paper
on
a
and
brought
it
hastily
but
alas
that
was
last
week
paper
he
did
not
save
her
the
trouble
but
he
brought
upon
himself
a
gleam
of
mischief
from
her
father
eyes
northcote
thinks
me
a
tyrant
to
send
you
for
the
paper
he
said
as
he
took
it
out
of
her
hands
thank
him
for
his
consideration
but
he
was
not
always
so
careful
of
your
peace
of
mind
he
added
with
a
laugh
ursula
looked
at
him
with
a
wondering
question
in
her
eyes
but
those
tears
were
no
longer
there
which
had
gone
to
northcote
heart
i
do
know
what
papa
means
she
said
softly
and
then
i
want
to
beg
your
pardon
please
i
was
very
silly
will
you
try
to
forget
it
and
not
tell
any
one
northcote
the
truth
was
i
thought
i
had
done
them
nicely
and
i
was
vexed
it
was
very
childish
she
said
shaking
her
head
with
something
of
the
same
moisture
floating
back
over
the
lustre
in
her
pretty
eyes
i
will
never
tell
any
one
you
may
be
sure
said
the
young
man
but
ursula
did
not
notice
that
he
declined
to
give
the
other
pledge
for
reginald
came
up
just
then
with
wrath
in
his
eyes
is
that
idiot
going
to
fiddle
all
night
he
cried
poor
clarence
had
scarcely
begun
as
if
anybody
wanted
to
hear
him
and
his
miss
beecham
plays
like
cecilia
ursula
and
i
want
to
speak
to
her
about
something
ca
you
get
that
brute
beguiled
away
clarence
was
the
one
who
was
in
the
little
party
but
he
fiddled
beatifically
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ceiling
without
the
slightest
suspicion
of
the
fact
while
phoebe
accompanied
him
with
little
smiles
at
her
friends
and
shrugs
of
her
shoulders
reginald
felt
very
strongly
though
for
the
first
time
that
she
was
over
doing
the
scriptural
maxim
of
being
all
things
to
all
men
chapter
xxx
society
at
the
parsonage
after
this
such
as
it
was
the
parsonage
became
gradually
the
centre
of
a
little
society
such
as
sometimes
forms
in
the
most
accidental
way
in
a
house
where
there
are
young
men
and
young
women
and
of
which
no
one
can
say
what
momentous
results
may
arise
they
came
together
fortuitously
blown
to
one
centre
by
the
merest
winds
of
circumstance
out
of
circles
totally
different
and
unlike
why
it
was
that
may
so
good
a
churchman
permitted
two
people
so
entirely
out
of
his
sphere
to
become
his
habitual
guests
and
the
companions
of
his
children
was
very
perplexing
to
the
outside
world
who
half
in
mere
surprise
and
a
little
in
despite
wondered
and
commented
till
they
were
tired
or
till
they
had
become
so
familiar
with
the
strange
spectacle
that
it
ceased
to
strike
them
a
rich
pupil
might
be
forgiven
for
being
a
dissenter
indeed
in
carlingford
as
elsewhere
money
made
up
for
most
deficiencies
but
even
natural
complacency
towards
the
rich
pupil
scarcely
accounted
for
the
reception
of
the
others
the
neighbours
could
never
be
quite
sure
whether
the
family
at
the
parsonage
knew
or
did
not
know
that
their
new
friend
northcote
was
not
only
acting
as
minister
of
salem
chapel
but
was
the
assailant
of
reginald
may
at
the
meeting
and
various
persons
in
grange
lane
held
themselves
for
a
long
time
on
the
of
preparation
ready
to
breathe
to
may
the
painful
intelligence
in
case
he
was
unaware
of
it
but
he
never
gave
them
the
opportunity
honestly
he
had
forgotten
the
speaker
name
at
first
and
only
recognized
him
when
he
was
introduced
by
young
copperhead
and
then
the
situation
was
piquant
and
amused
him
especially
the
evident
confusion
and
consternation
of
the
culprit
when
found
out
i
do
know
what
he
thinks
he
has
done
to
you
said
clarence
i
could
scarcely
make
him
come
in
he
says
he
is
sure
you
ca
wish
to
see
him
this
was
two
days
after
the
dinner
when
horace
northcote
came
to
leave
a
respectful
card
hoping
that
he
might
see
ursula
at
a
door
or
window
clarence
had
seized
upon
him
and
dragged
him
in
in
spite
of
himself
on
the
contrary
i
am
very
glad
to
see
him
said
may
with
a
smile
he
looked
at
the
young
dissenter
with
a
jeer
in
his
eyes
he
liked
to
punish
him
having
suddenly
perceived
that
this
jeer
was
much
more
potent
than
any
serious
penalty
if
he
will
promise
not
to
slay
me
i
sha
quarrel
with
him
may
was
in
such
good
spirits
at
this
moment
that
he
could
afford
to
joke
his
own
magnanimity
and
the
other
confused
looks
of
guilt
overcame
his
gravity
come
back
again
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
and
though
horace
retired
for
the
moment
utterly
confounded
yet
the
attractions
of
the
cheerful
house
overcame
after
a
while
his
sense
of
humiliation
and
inappropriateness
if
the
injured
family
had
condoned
his
offence
why
should
he
mind
and
the
pleasant
girlish
friendliness
without
any
of
ursula
was
enough
to
have
set
any
man
at
his
ease
the
facts
of
the
case
being
that
hurst
was
away
upon
a
long
visit
and
that
having
no
other
gossip
within
the
range
of
her
acquaintance
ursula
did
not
know
reginald
who
did
had
the
same
sense
of
magnanimity
as
his
father
had
and
began
to
like
the
society
of
the
congenial
yet
different
spirit
which
it
was
so
strange
to
him
to
find
under
a
guise
so
unlike
his
own
and
northcote
on
his
side
finding
no
house
to
which
he
could
betake
himself
among
those
whom
phoebe
called
our
own
people
found
a
refuge
which
gradually
became
dearer
and
dearer
to
him
at
the
parsonage
and
in
his
profound
sense
of
the
generosity
of
the
people
who
had
thus
received
him
felt
his
own
partizanship
wax
feebler
and
feebler
every
day
he
seemed
to
see
the
ground
cut
from
under
his
feet
as
he
watched
the
young
chaplain
at
his
work
may
to
be
sure
was
no
example
of
pastoral
diligence
but
he
was
a
pleasant
companion
and
had
put
himself
from
the
first
in
that
position
of
moral
superiority
which
naturally
belongs
to
an
injured
person
who
can
forgive
heartily
and
without
prejudice
and
ursula
he
did
not
venture
to
call
her
ursula
even
in
the
secret
depths
of
his
heart
there
a
pronoun
was
enough
as
indeed
incipient
love
generally
finds
it
she
spoke
to
him
smiled
at
him
in
the
street
and
immediately
life
became
a
to
him
the
young
dissenter
was
as
dante
and
simple
ursula
with
her
housekeeping
books
in
her
hand
became
another
beatrice
it
is
not
every
one
who
has
the
capacity
for
this
perfect
and
absorbing
sentiment
but
horace
northcote
had
and
for
a
long
time
ursula
was
as
unconscious
of
it
as
heart
could
desire
phoebe
admission
to
the
house
had
been
more
simple
still
a
girlish
fancy
on
ursula
part
a
fit
of
on
her
father
and
then
that
secret
thread
of
connection
with
tozer
which
no
one
knew
of
and
the
coming
of
clarence
copperhead
to
please
whom
may
permitted
himself
to
be
persuaded
to
do
much
and
in
addition
to
all
this
her
good
looks
her
pretty
manners
her
cleverness
and
the
deference
she
had
always
shown
in
the
proper
quarter
may
did
not
enter
into
the
lists
with
his
son
or
think
of
offering
himself
as
a
suitor
to
phoebe
but
he
liked
to
talk
to
her
and
to
watch
what
he
called
her
little
ways
and
to
hear
her
play
when
clarence
and
his
violin
were
otherwise
disposed
of
he
was
an
experienced
man
priding
himself
on
a
knowledge
of
human
nature
and
phoebe
little
ways
amused
him
greatly
what
did
she
mean
to
catch
clarence
copperhead
who
would
be
a
great
match
or
to
fascinate
northcote
oddly
enough
may
never
thought
of
reginald
though
that
young
man
showed
an
eagerness
to
talk
to
phoebe
which
was
more
than
equal
with
his
own
and
had
always
subjects
laid
up
ready
to
discuss
with
her
when
he
could
find
the
opportunity
sometimes
he
would
go
up
to
her
in
the
midst
of
the
little
party
and
broach
one
of
these
topics
straight
on
end
without
preface
or
introduction
as
which
was
her
favourite
play
of
shakespeare
and
what
did
she
think
of
the
character
of
king
lear
it
was
not
very
wise
not
any
wiser
than
his
neighbour
was
who
made
pretty
little
ursula
into
the
ideal
lady
the
most
gentle
and
stately
figure
in
poetry
and
yet
no
doubt
there
was
something
in
both
follies
that
was
a
great
deal
better
than
wisdom
the
society
formed
by
these
two
young
pairs
with
clarence
copperhead
as
a
heavy
floating
balance
and
may
and
janey
one
philosophical
wise
and
mistaken
the
other
and
seeing
everything
as
spectators
was
very
pleasant
to
the
close
little
coterie
themselves
and
nobody
else
got
within
the
charmed
circle
they
grew
more
and
more
intimate
daily
and
had
a
whole
vocabulary
of
domestic
jokes
and
allusions
which
no
one
else
could
understand
it
must
be
allowed
however
that
the
outside
world
was
not
pleased
with
this
arrangement
on
either
side
of
the
question
the
church
people
were
shocked
with
the
mays
for
harbouring
dissenters
under
any
circumstances
whatever
and
there
had
not
been
a
minister
at
salem
chapel
for
a
long
time
so
unpopular
as
horace
northcote
who
was
always
engaged
when
any
of
the
connection
asked
him
to
tea
and
preached
sermons
which
went
over
their
heads
and
did
not
remember
them
when
he
met
them
in
the
street
tozer
was
about
the
only
one
of
the
congregation
who
stood
up
for
the
young
man
the
others
thanked
heaven
that
he
was
but
tempory
and
on
the
whole
they
were
right
for
certainly
he
was
out
of
place
in
his
present
post
as
for
clarence
copperhead
he
led
an
agreeable
life
enough
among
all
these
undercurrents
of
feeling
which
he
did
not
recognise
with
any
distinctness
he
was
comfortable
enough
pleased
with
his
own
importance
and
too
obtuse
to
perceive
that
he
bored
his
companions
and
then
he
considered
himself
to
be
slightly
sweet
upon
both
the
girls
ursula
was
his
favourite
in
the
morning
when
he
embarrassed
her
much
by
persistently
seeking
her
company
whenever
liberated
by
her
father
but
phoebe
was
the
queen
of
the
evening
when
he
would
get
his
fiddle
with
an
unfailing
complacency
which
drove
reginald
frantic
whether
it
was
mere
or
any
warmer
impulse
phoebe
was
strangely
tolerant
of
these
fiddlings
and
would
go
on
playing
for
hours
with
serene
composure
never
tired
and
never
impatient
yet
poor
clarence
was
not
an
accompanyist
to
be
coveted
he
was
weak
in
the
ear
and
defective
in
science
but
full
of
a
cheerful
confidence
which
was
as
good
as
genius
never
mind
miss
phoebe
he
would
say
cheerfully
when
he
had
broken
down
for
the
twentieth
time
play
on
and
i
catch
you
up
he
had
thus
a
series
of
trysting
places
in
every
page
or
two
which
might
have
been
very
laughable
to
an
indifferent
spectator
but
which
aggravated
the
mays
father
and
son
to
an
intolerable
extent
they
were
the
two
who
suffered
as
for
horace
northcote
who
was
not
a
great
talker
it
was
a
not
disagreeable
shield
for
his
silent
contemplation
of
ursula
and
the
little
things
which
from
time
to
time
he
ventured
to
say
to
her
for
conversation
he
had
not
the
thirst
which
animated
reginald
and
ursula
talk
though
lively
and
natural
was
not
like
phoebe
but
while
the
music
went
on
he
could
sit
by
her
in
a
state
of
silent
beatitude
now
and
then
saying
something
to
which
ursula
replied
if
she
was
disposed
or
if
she
was
not
disposed
put
aside
by
a
little
shake
of
her
head
and
smiling
glance
at
the
piano
sometimes
it
was
simple
wilfulness
that
made
her
silent
but
northcote
set
it
down
to
an
angelical
sweetness
which
would
not
wound
even
the
worst
of
performances
by
inattention
they
were
happy
enough
sitting
there
under
the
shelter
of
the
piano
the
young
man
absorbed
in
the
dreams
of
a
young
love
the
girl
just
beginning
to
realize
the
adoration
which
she
was
receiving
with
a
timid
perception
of
it
she
was
in
spite
of
herself
amused
by
the
idea
only
half
understood
and
which
she
could
scarcely
believe
that
this
big
grown
man
so
much
more
important
than
herself
in
everybody
eyes
should
show
so
much
respect
to
a
little
girl
whom
her
father
scolded
whom
reginald
sent
trotting
about
on
all
sorts
of
errands
and
whom
cousin
anne
and
cousin
sophy
considered
a
child
it
was
very
strange
a
thing
to
call
forth
inextinguishable
laughter
and
yet
with
a
strange
touch
of
sweetness
in
it
which
almost
made
her
cry
in
wondering
gratitude
what
she
thought
of
him
ursula
did
not
ask
herself
that
he
should
think
of
her
was
the
bewildering
extraordinary
ridiculous
fact
that
at
present
filled
her
girlish
head
but
if
they
were
sweet
to
northcote
these
evenings
were
the
crown
of
clarence
copperhead
content
and
conscious
success
he
was
supremely
happy
caressing
his
fiddle
between
his
cheek
and
his
shoulder
and
raising
his
pale
eyes
to
the
ceiling
in
an
ecstasy
the
music
and
the
audience
and
the
accompanyist
all
together
were
delightful
to
him
he
could
have
gone
on
he
felt
not
only
till
midnight
but
till
morning
and
so
on
to
midnight
again
with
short
intervals
for
refreshment
every
ten
minutes
or
so
there
occurred
a
break
in
the
continuity
of
the
strain
and
a
little
dialogue
between
the
performers
ah
yes
i
have
missed
a
line
never
mind
go
on
miss
phoebe
i
will
make
up
to
you
he
said
it
is
those
accidentals
that
have
been
your
ruin
said
phoebe
laughing
it
is
a
very
hard
passage
let
us
turn
back
and
begin
again
and
then
the
audience
would
laugh
not
very
sweetly
and
some
of
them
make
acrid
observations
but
the
pianist
was
itself
and
went
back
and
counted
and
kept
time
with
her
head
and
with
her
hand
when
she
could
take
it
from
the
piano
until
she
had
triumphantly
tided
him
over
the
bad
passage
or
they
had
come
to
the
point
of
shipwreck
again
during
these
labours
phoebe
who
was
really
a
good
musician
ought
to
have
suffered
horribly
but
either
she
did
not
or
her
was
stronger
than
her
good
taste
for
she
went
on
serenely
sometimes
for
hours
together
while
her
old
and
her
young
admirers
sat
secretly
cursing
in
such
ways
as
are
becoming
to
a
clergyman
each
in
his
corner
perhaps
she
had
a
slight
degree
of
pleasure
in
the
evident
power
she
had
over
father
and
son
but
it
was
difficult
fully
to
understand
her
views
at
this
somewhat
bewildering
period
of
her
life
in
which
she
was
left
entirely
to
her
own
resources
she
was
herself
groping
a
little
through
paths
of
uncertain
footing
enjoying
herself
a
great
deal
but
not
seeing
clearly
where
it
led
to
and
having
no
definite
purpose
or
chart
of
those
unknown
countries
in
her
mind
how
you
can
go
on
said
reginald
on
one
of
these
occasions
having
at
length
managed
to
seize
upon
and
get
her
into
a
corner
for
hours
having
your
ears
sacrificed
and
your
patience
tried
by
these
fearful
discords
and
smile
through
it
is
a
mystery
which
i
can
not
fathom
if
it
was
only
consideration
for
your
audience
that
might
be
enough
to
move
any
one
but
yourself
i
do
seem
to
feel
it
so
very
much
myself
and
yet
you
are
a
musician
do
be
too
hard
upon
me
mr
may
i
only
play
a
little
i
am
not
like
my
cousins
in
the
high
street
who
are
supposed
to
be
very
clever
at
music
and
then
poor
copperhead
is
a
very
old
friend
poor
copperhead
poor
us
you
mean
who
have
to
listen
and
you
who
choose
to
play
you
are
very
vindictive
she
said
with
a
piteous
look
why
should
you
be
so
vindictive
i
do
what
i
can
to
please
my
friends
and
there
is
no
doubt
about
what
poor
clarence
likes
best
if
you
were
to
show
me
as
plainly
what
you
would
like
plainly
as
he
does
do
you
know
said
reginald
with
glowing
eyes
ah
well
if
i
may
show
you
plainly
quite
plainly
with
the
same
results
you
may
be
sure
not
to
be
left
long
in
doubt
talk
to
me
it
is
easier
and
not
so
fatiguing
here
said
the
young
man
placing
a
chair
for
her
he
has
had
your
patient
services
for
two
hours
do
only
half
as
much
for
me
ah
but
talking
is
a
different
thing
and
more
difficult
and
more
personal
well
said
phoebe
with
a
laugh
and
a
blush
taking
the
chair
i
will
try
but
you
must
begin
and
i
can
not
promise
you
know
for
a
whole
hour
after
you
have
given
that
fellow
two
and
such
a
fellow
if
it
was
northcote
i
might
be
equally
jea
displeased
but
i
could
understand
it
for
he
is
not
a
fool
i
think
said
phoebe
looking
towards
the
other
end
of
the
room
where
northcote
was
occupied
as
usual
close
to
ursula
that
northcote
manages
to
amuse
himself
very
well
without
any
help
of
mine
ah
cried
reginald
startled
for
of
course
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
idea
of
any
special
devotion
to
his
little
sister
had
never
entered
his
mind
he
felt
disposed
to
laugh
at
first
when
the
idea
was
suggested
to
him
but
he
gave
a
second
look
and
threw
a
certain
enlightenment
upon
the
subject
that
would
never
do
he
said
gravely
i
wonder
i
never
thought
of
it
before
why
would
it
not
do
she
is
very
nice
and
he
is
clever
and
a
rising
man
and
he
is
very
well
off
and
you
said
just
now
he
was
not
a
fool
nevertheless
it
would
never
do
said
reginald
opposing
her
pointedly
as
he
had
never
opposed
her
before
and
he
remained
silent
for
a
whole
minute
looking
across
the
room
during
which
long
interval
phoebe
sat
demurely
on
the
chair
where
he
had
placed
her
looking
at
him
with
a
smile
on
her
face
well
she
said
at
length
softly
it
was
talk
you
said
you
wanted
may
but
you
are
not
so
ready
to
tune
up
your
violin
as
copperhead
though
i
wait
with
my
fingers
on
the
piano
so
to
speak
i
beg
your
pardon
he
cried
and
then
their
eyes
met
and
both
laughed
though
as
far
as
reginald
was
concerned
in
an
embarrassed
way
you
perceive
said
phoebe
rising
that
it
is
not
nearly
so
easy
to
please
you
and
that
you
do
know
half
so
exactly
what
you
want
as
clarence
copperhead
does
though
you
abuse
him
poor
fellow
i
have
got
something
to
say
to
ursula
though
perhaps
she
does
not
want
me
any
more
than
you
do
do
give
me
up
for
one
moment
distraction
and
it
was
your
fault
not
mine
for
suggesting
such
a
startling
idea
phoebe
shook
her
head
and
waved
her
hand
as
a
parting
salutation
and
then
went
across
the
room
to
where
ursula
was
sitting
where
horace
northcote
at
least
found
her
very
much
in
his
way
she
began
at
once
to
talk
low
and
earnestly
on
some
subject
so
interesting
that
it
absorbed
both
the
girls
in
a
way
which
was
very
surprising
and
unpleasant
to
the
young
men
neither
of
whom
had
been
able
to
interest
the
one
whose
attention
he
was
specially
anxious
to
secure
half
so
effectually
northcote
from
the
other
side
of
the
table
and
reginald
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
gazed
and
gloomed
with
discomfited
curiosity
wondering
what
it
could
be
while
clarence
strutted
uneasily
about
the
piano
taking
up
his
fiddle
now
and
then
striking
a
note
and
screwing
up
his
strings
into
concord
with
many
impatient
glances
but
still
the
girls
talked
was
it
about
their
dresses
or
some
nonsense
or
was
it
a
more
serious
subject
which
could
thus
be
discussed
without
masculine
help
but
this
matter
they
never
fathomed
nor
have
they
found
out
till
this
hour
chapter
xxxi
society
notwithstanding
such
little
social
crosses
however
the
society
at
the
parsonage
as
thus
constituted
was
very
agreeable
may
though
he
had
his
faults
was
careful
of
his
daughter
he
sat
in
the
every
evening
till
she
retired
on
the
nights
their
visitors
came
and
even
when
it
was
clarence
only
who
remained
an
inmate
of
the
house
and
free
to
go
and
come
as
he
pleased
ursula
he
felt
must
not
be
left
alone
and
though
it
is
uncertain
whether
she
fully
appreciated
the
care
he
took
of
her
this
point
in
his
character
is
worth
noting
when
the
young
party
went
out
together
to
skate
for
instance
as
they
did
for
several
merry
days
reginald
and
janey
were
he
considered
sufficient
guardians
for
their
sister
phoebe
had
no
chaperon
unless
you
will
take
that
serious
office
upon
you
ursula
she
said
shrugging
her
shoulders
prettily
but
she
only
went
once
or
twice
so
well
was
she
able
even
when
the
temptation
was
strongest
to
exercise
and
show
her
perfect
power
of
as
for
old
tozer
and
his
wife
the
idea
of
a
chaperon
never
entered
their
homely
head
such
articles
are
unnecessary
in
the
lower
levels
of
society
they
were
anxious
that
their
child
should
enjoy
herself
and
could
not
understand
the
reason
of
her
staying
at
home
on
a
bright
frosty
day
when
the
mays
came
to
the
door
in
a
body
to
fetch
her
no
if
they
have
gone
down
on
their
knees
nor
if
i
had
gone
down
on
mine
would
that
girl
have
left
me
cried
the
old
lady
with
tears
in
her
eyes
she
do
behave
beautiful
to
her
old
granny
if
so
be
as
i
have
a
good
night
no
power
on
earth
would
make
that
child
go
pleasuring
it
too
much
at
her
age
but
phoebe
confided
to
ursula
that
it
was
not
altogether
anxiety
about
her
grandmother
i
have
nobody
of
my
own
to
go
with
if
i
took
grandpapa
with
me
i
do
think
it
would
mend
matters
once
or
twice
it
was
possible
but
not
every
day
go
and
enjoy
yourself
dear
she
said
kissing
her
friend
ursula
was
disposed
to
cry
rather
than
to
enjoy
herself
and
appealed
to
reginald
who
was
deeply
touched
by
phoebe
fine
feeling
he
took
his
sister
to
the
ice
but
that
day
he
went
so
far
as
to
go
back
himself
to
no
actually
into
the
house
to
make
a
humble
protest
yet
to
insinuate
his
admiration
he
was
much
impressed
by
and
approved
highly
of
this
reticence
having
a
very
high
standard
of
minor
morals
for
ladies
in
his
mind
like
most
young
men
she
is
not
one
of
the
girls
who
rush
about
everywhere
and
whom
one
is
sick
of
seeing
he
said
i
think
it
is
very
silly
cried
janey
who
cares
for
a
chaperon
and
why
should
phoebe
have
her
fun
like
the
rest
instead
of
shutting
herself
up
in
a
stuffy
room
with
that
dreadful
old
mrs
tozer
her
brother
reproved
her
so
sharply
for
this
speech
that
janey
withdrew
in
tears
still
asking
why
as
she
rushed
to
her
room
clarence
copperhead
for
his
part
stroked
his
moustache
and
said
it
was
a
bore
for
she
is
the
best
skater
of
all
the
ladies
here
he
said
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
ursula
she
got
so
much
go
in
her
and
keeps
it
up
like
fun
she
the
best
i
know
for
keeping
a
fellow
from
getting
tired
but
as
it
thursday
i
suppose
she
be
there
in
the
evening
clarence
never
called
them
anything
but
miss
ursula
and
miss
phoebe
dropping
the
prefix
in
his
thoughts
he
felt
that
he
was
a
little
sweet
upon
them
both
and
indeed
it
had
gleamed
dully
across
his
mind
that
a
man
who
could
marry
them
both
need
never
be
bored
but
was
likely
always
to
find
something
to
do
choice
however
being
necessary
he
did
not
see
his
way
so
clearly
as
to
which
he
would
choose
the
mountain
sheep
are
sweeter
but
the
valley
sheep
are
fatter
he
said
to
himself
if
not
in
these
immortal
words
yet
with
full
appreciation
of
the
sentiment
ursula
began
to
understand
dinners
with
a
judicious
intelligence
which
he
felt
was
partly
created
by
his
own
instructions
and
remarks
but
in
the
evening
it
was
phoebe
who
reigned
supreme
she
was
so
sensible
that
most
likely
she
could
invent
a
all
out
of
her
own
head
he
thought
feeling
that
the
girl
who
got
him
through
the
wedding
march
with
but
six
mistakes
was
capable
of
any
intellectual
feat
he
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
it
was
in
his
power
to
marry
either
of
the
girls
as
soon
as
he
chose
to
intimate
his
choice
and
in
the
mean
time
he
found
it
very
agreeable
to
maintain
a
kind
of
mental
possibility
of
future
proprietorship
of
them
both
and
thus
the
pleasant
life
ran
on
in
the
most
agreeable
absorption
and
abstraction
from
the
world
outside
do
ask
any
one
else
why
should
we
have
any
one
else
they
all
said
except
janey
who
had
condescended
to
appear
in
the
evening
in
her
best
frock
though
she
was
not
admitted
at
dinner
and
who
thought
a
few
additional
guests
and
a
round
game
now
and
then
would
be
delightful
variations
upon
the
ordinary
programme
but
the
others
did
not
agree
with
her
they
became
more
and
more
intimate
mingling
the
brother
and
sister
relationship
with
a
something
unnamed
unexpressed
which
gave
a
subtle
flavour
to
their
talks
and
flirtations
in
that
incipient
stage
of
this
process
is
very
pleasant
even
to
the
spectators
full
of
little
excitements
and
surprises
and
sharp
stings
of
momentary
quarrel
and
great
revolutions
done
with
a
single
look
which
are
infinitely
amusing
to
the
the
house
became
a
real
domestic
centre
thought
of
by
each
and
all
with
tender
sentiment
such
as
made
its
owners
somewhat
proud
of
it
they
could
scarcely
tell
why
even
may
felt
a
certain
complacence
in
the
fact
that
the
young
men
were
so
fond
of
the
parsonage
and
when
he
heard
complaints
of
the
coldness
and
dullness
of
domestic
intercourse
smiled
and
said
that
he
did
not
feel
it
so
with
that
pleasant
sense
of
something
superior
in
himself
to
cause
this
difference
which
is
sweet
to
the
greatest
stoic
for
he
was
not
as
yet
enlightened
as
to
the
entire
indifference
of
the
little
circle
to
any
charm
in
him
and
would
have
been
utterly
confounded
had
any
one
told
him
that
to
the
grave
and
reflective
northcote
whom
he
had
treated
with
such
magnanimous
charity
binding
him
evidently
by
bonds
of
gratitude
to
himself
for
ever
it
was
little
ursula
and
not
her
father
who
was
the
magnet
of
attraction
may
was
a
clever
man
and
yet
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
any
comparison
between
his
own
society
and
that
of
ursula
was
possible
ursula
a
child
he
would
have
laughed
aloud
at
the
thought
but
all
this
pleasant
society
though
father
and
daughter
both
agreed
that
it
cost
nothing
for
what
is
a
cake
and
a
cup
of
tea
and
the
late
dinners
and
the
extra
maid
and
the
additional
fires
and
general
enlargement
of
expenditure
made
immense
inroads
it
must
be
allowed
into
the
additional
income
brought
by
clarence
copperhead
the
first
quarter
payment
was
spent
and
more
than
spent
before
it
came
the
money
that
was
to
be
laid
up
for
that
bill
of
tozer
perhaps
had
now
no
saving
peradventure
left
in
it
for
the
second
half
would
not
be
due
till
two
months
after
the
tozer
bill
and
would
but
be
half
even
if
procurable
at
once
may
felt
a
slight
shock
while
this
gleamed
across
his
mind
but
only
for
a
moment
there
was
still
a
month
and
a
month
is
a
long
time
and
in
the
mean
time
james
was
almost
certain
to
send
something
and
his
easter
offerings
might
probably
would
this
year
be
something
worth
having
why
they
should
be
better
than
usual
this
year
may
did
not
explain
to
himself
his
head
was
a
little
turned
it
must
be
supposed
by
the
momentary
chance
of
having
more
money
in
his
hands
than
he
used
to
have
already
he
had
got
into
the
habit
of
ordering
what
he
wanted
somewhat
recklessly
without
asking
himself
how
the
things
he
ordered
were
to
be
paid
for
and
as
so
often
happened
followed
up
that
first
tampering
with
the
rules
of
right
and
wrong
by
a
general
recklessness
of
the
most
dangerous
kind
he
was
not
so
much
alone
as
he
had
been
his
house
in
which
he
was
infinitely
more
amiable
than
of
old
had
become
more
pleasant
to
him
he
liked
his
life
better
his
son
was
independent
with
an
income
of
his
own
and
therefore
he
felt
much
more
respect
for
him
and
treated
him
as
a
companion
his
daughter
had
developed
if
not
in
the
way
of
a
talent
for
dinners
which
raised
her
very
much
in
his
eyes
and
naturally
the
regard
shown
to
her
by
the
visitors
reacted
upon
may
though
it
had
not
crossed
his
mind
as
yet
that
any
one
could
be
in
love
with
ursula
all
this
made
him
happier
in
spite
of
himself
when
you
begin
to
esteem
and
be
proud
of
your
children
your
life
is
naturally
happier
than
when
you
scoff
and
jeer
at
them
and
treat
them
as
creatures
of
inferior
mould
to
yourself
may
found
out
all
at
once
that
reginald
was
a
fine
young
fellow
that
ursula
was
pretty
and
pleasant
and
that
droll
janey
with
her
and
angles
was
amusing
at
least
if
no
more
as
for
the
little
ones
they
were
considerably
thrust
into
a
corner
when
the
elder
youth
forced
itself
into
the
front
they
learned
their
lessons
in
corners
and
had
their
tea
by
themselves
and
were
much
humbled
and
subdued
from
the
moment
in
which
their
and
toys
had
meandered
over
the
whole
house
and
their
looks
and
likings
had
been
just
as
important
as
anything
else
when
there
is
no
mother
to
protect
them
the
elder
sister
first
lover
marks
a
terribly
critical
period
for
the
children
of
the
house
they
were
banished
from
the
except
on
special
occasions
when
they
came
grande
in
their
best
things
and
were
jeered
at
by
copperhead
he
called
them
the
kids
both
amy
and
robin
were
aware
and
they
resented
it
unspeakably
thus
the
inward
happiness
of
the
mays
confined
itself
to
the
upper
regions
of
the
family
even
betsy
regretted
the
days
when
if
she
had
more
to
do
she
had
at
least
her
kitchen
to
herself
and
nobody
to
share
the
credit
there
was
more
fuss
and
more
worry
if
a
trifle
less
labour
and
the
increase
in
consequence
which
resulted
from
being
called
cook
instead
of
was
scarcely
so
sweet
in
possession
as
had
seemed
in
prospect
them
late
dinners
were
the
object
of
her
perpetual
railings
oh
how
much
more
comfortable
it
was
if
gentry
would
but
think
so
to
have
your
dinner
at
two
and
get
done
with
your
washing
up
before
you
was
cleaned
or
had
any
occasion
to
bother
yourself
about
your
cap
when
little
amy
cried
over
the
loneliness
of
the
children
tea
which
they
frequently
had
to
pour
out
for
themselves
betty
gave
her
a
cake
and
a
kiss
and
felt
disposed
to
cry
too
and
she
do
know
poor
child
not
the
half
said
betty
which
was
a
kind
of
oracular
sentence
difficult
for
betty
herself
to
understand
the
children
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
late
dinner
they
were
sent
to
bed
earlier
than
they
used
to
be
and
scolded
if
any
distant
sounds
of
romps
made
itself
audible
at
seven
when
their
elders
were
dining
and
then
when
the
little
ones
went
injured
to
bed
and
johnnie
indignant
worked
at
his
lessons
by
himself
in
a
corner
of
the
old
nursery
deeply
aware
that
his
boots
and
jacket
were
quite
unfit
for
the
the
young
people
ran
lightly
upstairs
all
smiles
and
pleasure
and
those
delightful
evenings
began
the
children
sometimes
could
not
get
to
sleep
for
the
piano
and
the
raspings
of
the
fiddle
which
sounds
of
mirth
suggested
nothing
but
the
wildest
enjoyment
to
them
and
when
the
door
opened
now
and
then
bursts
of
laughter
and
mingling
voices
would
come
out
like
the
sounds
the
peri
heard
at
the
gates
of
paradise
the
elder
ones
were
happy
their
little
atoms
of
individual
life
had
all
united
for
the
moment
into
one
sunshiny
and
broad
foundation
on
which
everything
seemed
to
rest
with
that
strange
sense
of
stability
and
continuance
which
such
a
moment
of
happiness
though
it
carries
every
element
of
change
in
it
almost
invariably
brings
it
felt
as
if
it
might
go
on
for
ever
and
yet
the
very
sentiment
that
inspired
it
made
separation
and
convulsion
inevitable
one
of
those
strange
paradoxes
which
occur
every
day
thus
the
year
crept
round
and
winter
melted
away
with
all
its
amusements
and
spring
began
northcote
time
at
salem
chapel
was
more
than
half
over
a
fact
on
which
the
congregation
congratulated
itself
much
if
so
be
as
he
had
a
settled
charge
of
his
own
i
should
be
sorry
to
see
him
gone
said
one
of
the
recent
members
settled
charge
you
take
my
word
said
pigeon
who
was
getting
old
but
always
continued
a
woman
of
spirit
he
never
have
a
settled
charge
in
our
connection
he
carries
on
here
he
ca
help
hisself
but
he
ai
cut
out
for
a
pastor
and
he
a
deal
too
thick
with
them
church
folks
a
parson
too
i
thought
he
had
more
pride
nay
now
but
i
do
wish
him
no
harm
said
the
first
speaker
a
civil
spoken
gentleman
if
he
ai
so
free
and
so
pleasant
as
a
body
looks
for
civil
spoken
said
the
other
one
of
our
own
ministers
in
our
own
connection
bless
you
they
our
servants
that
what
they
are
like
to
see
one
on
as
take
upon
him
to
be
civil
spoken
to
me
well
i
would
go
as
far
as
that
cried
brown
we
pays
their
salary
and
we
a
right
to
a
civil
word
but
a
minister
a
minister
and
i
show
him
respect
as
long
as
he
deserves
it
i
one
for
being
too
hard
upon
ministers
especially
when
they
young
men
as
has
their
temptations
like
we
all
know
i
do
know
what
you
call
temptations
said
pigeon
licking
the
dust
under
the
feet
of
a
church
parson
and
after
speaking
up
so
bold
against
young
may
and
them
old
cheats
at
the
college
i
wish
he
was
gone
from
here
that
what
i
wish
and
our
old
pastor
if
we
ca
get
none
better
back
again
he
was
one
as
knew
his
place
and
would
have
set
his
foot
inside
one
of
them
parsonages
parsonages
indeed
kept
up
with
our
money
if
ever
there
was
an
iniquity
on
this
earth
it
a
state
church
and
all
the
argufying
in
the
world
wo
put
that
out
of
me
it
happened
that
northcote
was
in
the
poulterer
shop
talking
to
the
poulterer
himself
at
this
moment
and
he
heard
the
conclusion
of
this
speech
delivered
with
much
unction
and
force
such
sentiments
would
have
charmed
him
three
months
ago
and
probably
he
would
have
thought
this
uneducated
but
strenuous
partisan
an
extremely
intelligent
woman
he
hurried
away
now
with
an
uncomfortable
smile
if
an
opinion
is
the
right
opinion
why
should
it
have
an
air
of
absurdity
thrown
upon
it
by
being
thus
uttered
in
ungrammatical
language
by
a
poulterer
wife
truth
is
the
same
by
whomsoever
stated
but
yet
was
not
dogmatism
on
any
subject
the
sign
of
an
inexperienced
and
uncultivated
or
a
rude
and
untutored
mind
what
did
this
woman
know
of
the
parsonage
which
she
supposed
she
helped
to
pay
for
what
had
he
himself
known
three
months
ago
of
reginald
may
whom
he
had
assaulted
so
savagely
this
church
family
which
pigeon
knew
no
better
than
to
abuse
with
what
divine
charity
it
had
received
himself
notwithstanding
his
public
sin
against
it
when
he
thought
of
that
public
sin
northcote
countenance
glowed
with
shame
and
it
continued
to
glow
with
a
more
agreeable
warmth
when
he
escaped
into
thought
of
the
goodness
which
the
mays
had
shown
him
had
there
ever
been
such
goodness
was
there
ever
so
sweet
a
home
of
the
heart
as
that
faded
homely
his
heart
beat
high
his
steps
quickened
they
carried
him
down
grange
lane
in
a
path
so
often
trod
that
he
felt
there
must
be
a
special
track
of
his
own
under
the
garden
walls
going
parsonage
way
chapter
xxxii
sam
hurst
had
been
a
long
time
out
of
carlingford
she
had
been
paying
visits
among
her
friends
with
whom
though
the
young
mays
would
never
believe
it
she
was
very
popular
for
she
was
not
in
her
gossip
and
she
was
often
amusing
in
the
fulness
of
her
interest
in
other
people
it
was
april
when
she
came
back
and
the
early
warmth
and
softness
of
the
spring
were
beginning
to
be
felt
in
grange
lane
the
doors
of
the
houses
began
to
be
left
open
and
the
girls
at
the
parsonage
had
taken
to
running
out
and
in
without
their
hats
gleaming
through
the
little
shrubbery
in
front
and
round
to
the
back
garden
one
evening
it
was
so
mild
that
they
all
which
comprehensive
term
sometimes
extended
to
the
whole
party
began
to
be
commonly
used
among
them
with
that
complacence
in
the
exclusiveness
of
their
little
coterie
which
every
set
more
or
less
feels
came
downstairs
in
a
body
and
wandered
about
among
the
in
the
spring
moonlight
there
was
ursula
and
northcote
phoebe
and
reginald
and
clarence
copperhead
with
janey
behind
who
followed
where
they
went
but
did
not
enjoy
the
ceremony
it
was
bad
enough
in
the
but
moonlight
who
cared
about
moonlight
janey
said
to
herself
indignantly
she
was
the
only
one
who
looked
up
to
hurst
window
where
there
was
a
faint
light
and
when
the
voices
became
audible
janey
perceived
some
one
come
behind
the
curtain
and
look
out
the
girl
was
divided
between
her
faithful
family
feud
against
hurst
and
a
vague
sense
of
satisfaction
in
her
presence
as
a
marplot
who
one
way
or
other
would
infallibly
interfere
she
will
say
something
to
papa
said
janey
her
heart
involuntary
rising
at
the
thought
though
at
the
same
time
she
shivered
to
think
of
the
treachery
involved
to
all
the
tenets
of
the
family
janey
sat
on
the
steps
and
listened
to
the
others
talking
no
one
pointed
out
the
stars
to
her
or
followed
her
about
as
reginald
followed
phoebe
as
for
copperhead
janey
thought
he
was
almost
as
lonely
as
she
was
he
had
lighted
his
cigar
and
was
strolling
up
and
down
interrupting
both
of
the
other
pairs
occasionally
breaking
into
the
midst
of
astronomical
lecture
abruptly
and
stopping
phoebe
herself
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
janey
watching
sharply
from
the
steps
noticed
as
a
spectator
has
it
in
her
power
to
do
that
whereas
northcote
was
extremely
impatient
of
the
interruption
and
discovered
immediately
that
the
stars
could
be
seen
better
from
another
spot
phoebe
took
it
quite
sweetly
and
addressed
herself
to
him
as
she
went
on
which
reginald
did
not
like
janey
was
sure
were
they
in
love
with
each
other
the
girl
asked
herself
was
this
how
it
was
managed
when
the
moon
went
under
a
cloud
for
a
moment
clarence
copperhead
vast
made
a
kind
of
substitute
down
below
janey
lost
the
other
two
among
the
bushes
but
she
always
beheld
that
orb
of
white
moving
backward
and
forward
with
two
dark
figures
near
she
felt
sure
reginald
did
not
want
to
have
him
in
such
close
neighbourhood
but
phoebe
voice
went
on
talking
to
both
alike
janey
was
and
she
had
a
jealous
dislike
such
as
most
girls
have
to
see
her
brother
engrossed
by
any
one
but
no
more
did
she
like
to
see
another
man
preferred
to
reginald
she
was
jealous
both
ways
as
she
sat
and
watched
a
slight
little
creak
came
to
her
sharp
ears
and
looking
up
she
saw
hurst
window
opened
the
very
least
little
bit
in
the
world
ah
janey
said
with
a
long
breath
there
was
nothing
she
would
not
have
given
to
have
talked
it
all
over
with
hurst
and
to
hear
what
she
would
say
if
she
had
not
been
the
traditional
adversary
against
whom
all
the
family
steeled
their
hearts
that
was
a
very
pleasant
evening
they
all
remembered
it
afterwards
it
was
the
moment
when
ursula
discovered
all
in
the
darkness
when
the
moon
was
under
that
cloud
northcote
it
flashed
upon
her
like
a
sudden
light
though
they
were
standing
in
the
shade
of
a
great
laurel
he
did
not
make
any
declaration
nor
say
a
word
that
she
could
remember
and
yet
all
at
once
by
some
magic
which
is
not
explainable
she
found
out
that
that
was
what
he
was
meaning
this
is
not
an
admirable
sentence
but
it
is
difficult
to
know
how
to
put
it
better
it
was
quite
a
strange
discovery
it
set
her
heart
beating
thumping
against
her
breast
she
herself
meant
nothing
whatever
and
she
never
thought
of
any
response
or
of
the
time
when
he
might
ask
her
to
make
a
response
the
sensation
of
the
moment
was
quite
enough
for
ursula
she
was
greatly
startled
surprised
yet
not
surprised
touched
and
full
of
a
wondering
respect
and
sympathy
awe
and
could
it
be
possible
was
what
it
was
though
he
was
not
conscious
of
betraying
himself
in
any
way
northcote
thought
he
had
done
something
to
offend
her
her
shy
silence
and
withdrawal
from
him
went
to
his
heart
never
had
her
society
been
so
sweet
never
had
he
had
her
so
completely
to
himself
what
had
he
done
to
alarm
or
offend
her
he
went
home
with
his
head
full
of
this
able
to
think
of
nothing
else
and
phoebe
went
home
too
escorted
by
reginald
and
clarence
together
to
her
grandfather
door
with
her
head
buzzing
with
many
thoughts
it
was
not
her
heart
that
was
in
a
commotion
like
little
ursula
she
was
more
experienced
though
she
was
not
much
older
and
had
gone
through
such
discoveries
before
now
but
a
much
more
perplexing
accident
had
befallen
her
reginald
may
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
and
clarence
copperhead
after
considerable
resistance
and
hanging
off
was
making
up
his
mind
to
propose
yes
phoebe
felt
with
unerring
instinct
that
this
was
the
state
of
affairs
he
was
making
up
his
mind
to
propose
so
much
of
her
and
so
little
of
her
had
at
length
made
an
end
of
all
the
prudent
hesitations
that
lay
under
the
crisp
of
that
starched
and
dazzling
shirt
front
that
he
should
never
be
able
to
speak
a
word
to
her
without
that
may
that
fellow
the
son
of
my
coach
poking
himself
in
was
a
thing
which
at
length
had
fired
his
cool
blood
to
fever
heat
nobody
else
could
play
his
accompaniments
like
that
or
pull
him
through
the
wedding
march
like
that
and
who
would
look
better
at
the
head
of
a
table
or
show
better
at
a
ball
or
get
on
better
in
society
no
one
he
knew
certainly
it
was
true
she
was
only
a
minister
daughter
and
without
a
penny
for
the
little
fortune
and
beecham
had
carefully
gathered
together
and
preserved
for
their
daughter
what
was
that
to
the
copperheads
nothing
not
a
penny
but
on
the
other
hand
clarence
felt
that
he
himself
or
rather
his
father
was
rich
enough
to
be
able
to
afford
a
wife
without
money
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
marry
money
and
a
wife
like
phoebe
what
a
relief
that
would
be
in
the
way
of
education
no
need
of
any
more
coaching
she
was
clever
and
fond
of
reading
and
so
forth
she
would
get
everything
up
for
him
if
he
went
into
parliament
or
that
sort
of
thing
why
she
keep
him
posted
up
there
ai
many
girls
that
could
do
that
he
said
to
himself
she
would
save
him
worlds
of
trouble
save
his
money
even
for
coaches
and
that
sort
of
thing
cost
money
and
then
that
fellow
may
would
be
out
of
it
his
nose
would
be
put
out
of
joint
these
are
not
eloquent
sentiments
but
so
it
was
that
clarence
natural
feelings
expressed
themselves
he
had
intimated
that
he
would
see
miss
phoebe
home
but
may
had
stalked
out
side
by
side
with
him
had
not
left
them
for
a
moment
and
clarence
determined
that
he
would
not
stand
it
any
longer
if
there
was
no
other
way
of
shaking
this
fellow
off
why
then
he
would
make
up
his
mind
to
it
and
propose
phoebe
somehow
saw
all
this
written
in
his
fine
countenance
and
she
saw
at
the
same
time
that
poor
reginald
who
was
she
thought
young
and
simple
and
just
the
sort
of
poor
boy
to
yield
to
such
folly
was
in
love
with
her
and
her
head
was
buzzing
with
the
double
discovery
the
first
was
of
course
the
most
important
she
had
no
time
to
indulge
her
thoughts
while
she
walked
up
between
them
keeping
them
in
play
each
with
a
word
talking
all
the
way
to
fill
up
the
somewhat
sulky
silence
between
them
but
when
she
got
safely
within
the
garden
door
and
heard
it
shut
behind
her
and
found
herself
in
the
quiet
of
the
little
green
enclosure
with
the
budding
trees
and
the
lilac
bushes
for
her
only
companions
the
relief
was
very
grateful
to
her
she
could
not
go
in
all
at
once
to
make
conversation
for
grandpapa
and
grandmamma
and
give
them
the
account
they
liked
to
hear
of
how
she
had
enjoyed
herself
she
took
off
her
hat
to
be
cooler
and
walked
slowly
down
under
the
moonlight
her
head
all
throbbing
and
rustling
with
thought
the
paths
were
bordered
with
primroses
which
made
a
pale
glimmer
in
the
moon
and
shed
a
soft
fragrance
about
phoebe
had
nothing
to
appeal
to
heaven
about
or
to
seek
counsel
from
nature
upon
as
sentimental
people
might
do
she
took
counsel
with
herself
the
person
most
interested
what
was
the
thing
she
ought
to
do
clarence
copperhead
was
going
to
propose
to
her
she
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
of
saying
to
herself
that
he
loved
her
it
was
reginald
who
did
that
a
totally
different
person
but
yet
the
other
was
more
urgent
what
was
phoebe
to
do
she
did
not
dislike
clarence
copperhead
and
it
was
no
horror
to
her
to
think
of
marrying
him
she
had
felt
for
years
that
this
might
be
on
the
cards
and
there
were
a
great
many
things
in
it
which
demanded
consideration
he
was
not
very
wise
nor
a
man
to
be
enthusiastic
about
but
he
would
be
a
career
to
phoebe
she
did
not
think
of
it
humbly
like
this
but
with
a
big
capital
a
career
yes
she
could
put
him
into
parliament
and
keep
him
there
she
could
thrust
him
forward
she
believed
to
the
front
of
affairs
he
would
be
as
good
as
a
profession
a
position
a
great
work
to
phoebe
he
meant
wealth
which
she
dismissed
in
its
superficial
aspect
as
something
meaningless
and
vulgar
but
accepted
in
its
higher
aspect
as
an
almost
necessary
condition
of
influence
and
he
meant
all
the
possibilities
of
future
power
who
can
say
that
she
was
not
as
romantic
as
any
girl
of
twenty
could
be
only
her
romance
took
an
unusual
form
it
was
her
head
that
was
full
of
throbbings
and
pulses
not
her
heart
no
doubt
there
would
be
difficulties
and
disagreeables
his
father
would
oppose
it
and
phoebe
felt
with
a
slight
shiver
that
his
opposition
was
nothing
to
be
laughed
at
and
that
copperhead
had
it
in
him
to
crush
rebellion
with
a
ferocious
hand
and
would
clarence
have
strength
of
mind
or
spirit
to
hold
out
this
was
a
very
serious
question
and
one
which
included
all
the
rest
if
she
accepted
his
proposal
would
he
have
the
heart
to
stand
to
it
against
his
father
or
would
her
consent
simply
involve
her
in
a
humiliating
struggle
which
would
end
in
defeat
that
was
the
great
question
if
this
should
be
the
case
what
use
would
there
be
in
any
sacrifice
that
phoebe
might
make
a
struggle
with
copperhead
would
affect
her
father
position
as
much
or
more
than
her
own
and
she
knew
that
a
great
many
of
the
congregation
would
infallibly
side
with
copperhead
feeling
it
a
most
dangerous
precedent
that
a
pastor
daughter
should
be
encouraged
to
think
herself
eligible
for
promotion
so
great
and
thus
interfere
with
the
more
suitable
matrimonial
prospects
of
wealthy
young
men
who
might
happen
to
attend
her
father
chapel
such
a
thing
the
conscript
fathers
of
the
connection
would
feel
ought
to
be
put
a
stop
to
with
a
high
hand
so
it
may
be
supposed
that
phoebe
had
enough
to
think
of
as
she
strolled
about
in
the
moonlight
alone
between
the
two
borders
of
primroses
tozer
thought
she
had
gone
upstairs
to
take
off
her
things
and
it
was
natural
that
when
a
girl
got
before
a
she
should
forget
the
progress
of
time
so
that
he
merely
wondered
at
her
until
the
little
chill
of
air
stole
in
from
the
open
door
and
made
tozer
cough
if
it
ai
our
phoebe
about
in
the
moonlight
like
a
said
tozer
in
consternation
drawing
aside
the
curtain
to
look
out
i
tell
you
what
old
woman
the
girl
in
love
and
what
it
is
he
thought
this
was
a
capital
joke
and
followed
his
witticism
with
a
laugh
not
much
wonder
neither
with
all
them
young
fellows
about
said
the
old
lady
you
may
laugh
but
tozer
i
ai
so
easy
in
my
mind
as
you
if
it
him
as
they
call
northcote
that
do
matter
but
if
it
that
big
gabby
of
a
copperhead
there
troubles
though
he
as
rich
they
do
say
as
creases
whoever
creases
might
be
and
it
would
be
a
credit
to
have
the
girl
make
a
match
like
that
out
of
our
house
whereat
tozer
again
laughed
loud
and
long
well
he
said
if
mister
creases
himself
was
here
i
would
say
as
he
was
a
bit
too
good
for
our
phoebe
do
you
trouble
your
head
old
woman
copperhead
or
one
let
her
make
her
choice
phoebe
junior
the
girl
as
be
their
match
and
you
may
take
my
word
for
that
phoebe
the
one
as
will
keep
them
in
their
right
place
whoever
they
may
be
phoebe
heard
this
laugh
echo
out
into
the
quiet
of
the
night
of
course
she
did
not
know
the
cause
of
it
but
it
disturbed
her
in
her
thoughts
poor
kind
excellent
grandpapa
she
said
to
herself
how
would
he
get
on
with
copperhead
he
would
touch
his
forelock
to
so
rich
a
man
he
would
go
down
metaphorically
upon
his
knees
before
so
much
wealth
and
what
a
fool
clarence
would
be
thought
on
every
side
for
wanting
to
marry
her
even
his
mother
who
was
a
romantic
woman
would
not
see
any
romance
in
it
if
it
was
she
phoebe
who
was
the
poor
girl
whom
he
wanted
to
marry
ursula
might
have
been
different
who
was
a
daughter
and
consequently
a
lady
by
prescriptive
right
but
herself
tozer
granddaughter
tom
tozer
niece
fresh
from
the
as
it
were
and
redolent
of
that
petty
trade
which
big
trade
ignores
as
much
as
the
greatest
aristocrat
does
phoebe
was
too
sensible
by
far
to
vex
or
distress
herself
on
this
point
but
she
recognised
it
without
any
hesitation
and
the
question
remained
was
it
for
her
advantage
to
enter
upon
this
struggle
about
which
there
could
be
no
mistake
or
was
it
not
and
this
question
was
very
difficult
she
did
not
dislike
clarence
but
then
she
was
not
in
love
with
him
he
would
be
a
career
but
he
was
not
a
passion
she
said
to
herself
with
a
smile
and
if
the
struggle
should
not
turn
out
successful
on
her
part
it
would
involve
a
kind
of
ruin
not
to
herself
only
but
to
all
concerned
what
then
was
she
to
do
the
only
thing
phoebe
decided
upon
was
that
if
she
did
enter
upon
that
struggle
it
be
successful
of
this
alone
there
could
be
no
manner
of
doubt
chapter
xxxiii
a
disclosure
well
young
ladies
said
sam
hurst
i
left
you
very
quiet
but
there
seems
to
be
plenty
going
on
what
a
beautiful
moon
there
was
last
night
i
put
up
my
window
to
look
at
it
and
all
at
once
i
found
there
was
a
party
going
on
below
quite
a
i
have
newly
come
from
abroad
you
know
and
it
seemed
quite
congenial
i
actually
rubbed
my
eyes
and
said
to
myself
ca
have
come
home
it
boulogne
still
it
is
carlingford
there
was
no
company
said
ursula
with
dignity
there
was
only
our
own
party
a
friend
of
reginald
and
a
friend
of
mine
join
us
often
in
the
evening
and
there
is
papa
pupil
if
you
call
that
a
party
we
are
just
as
quiet
as
when
you
went
away
we
never
invite
strangers
we
are
as
much
by
ourselves
as
ever
with
a
friend
of
reginald
and
a
friend
of
yours
and
papa
pupil
said
hurst
laughing
double
your
own
number
ursula
and
i
suppose
janey
counts
yet
why
there
is
a
young
man
too
many
how
dare
you
waste
the
gifts
of
providence
you
prodigal
child
and
now
let
me
hear
who
they
are
you
may
say
janey
does
count
cried
that
young
woman
in
person
oh
hurst
what
a
bore
they
are
if
that
society
i
do
care
for
society
one
always
following
ursula
about
whenever
she
moves
so
that
you
ca
say
a
word
to
her
and
the
others
pulling
poor
phoebe
to
pieces
who
hates
them
i
am
sure
phoebe
was
so
jolly
at
first
she
would
talk
to
you
or
she
would
play
for
you
why
she
taught
johnnie
and
me
a
to
sing
with
her
and
said
he
had
a
delightful
voice
but
she
never
has
any
time
to
look
at
us
now
said
janey
stopping
in
this
breathless
enumeration
of
wrongs
she
is
always
taken
up
with
those
horrible
men
i
suppose
you
call
reginald
a
horrible
man
said
ursula
with
rising
colour
if
that
was
my
opinion
of
my
own
brother
i
should
take
care
not
to
say
it
at
least
oh
reginald
is
the
worst
there
your
northcote
and
that
copperhead
woodenhead
we
call
him
in
the
nursery
oh
how
papa
can
put
up
with
him
i
ca
tell
he
never
had
any
patience
with
us
you
ca
think
how
dull
he
is
hurst
i
suppose
girls
do
mind
when
a
man
whether
he
stupid
or
not
i
never
heard
northcote
say
much
that
was
interesting
either
but
he
looks
clever
and
that
is
always
something
so
northcote
is
ursula
one
said
hurst
laughing
you
are
a
perfect
jewel
janey
and
i
do
know
how
i
should
ever
find
out
anything
that
going
on
but
for
you
northcote
it
is
a
new
name
in
carlingford
i
wonder
i
have
not
heard
of
him
already
or
have
you
kept
him
entirely
to
yourself
and
let
nobody
know
that
there
was
a
new
man
in
the
place
there
was
a
little
pause
here
the
girls
knew
nothing
about
northcote
except
the
one
fact
that
he
was
a
dissenter
but
as
hurst
was
an
excellent
churchwoman
much
better
than
they
were
who
had
perhaps
been
brought
up
too
completely
under
the
shadow
of
the
church
to
believe
in
it
implicitly
they
hesitated
before
pronouncing
before
her
that
unfortunate
name
i
do
know
whether
you
are
aware
ursula
said
at
last
with
some
slowness
and
reluctance
that
papa
pupil
is
of
a
dissenting
family
he
is
related
through
his
mother
to
our
cousins
the
dorsets
this
fact
ursula
put
forth
with
a
little
triumph
as
refuting
triumphantly
any
ready
conclusion
as
to
the
social
standing
of
dissenters
i
think
northcote
came
first
to
the
house
with
copperhead
he
is
a
dissenter
too
why
ursula
cried
hurst
not
the
man
who
attacked
reginald
in
the
meeting
it
was
all
in
the
papers
he
made
a
frightful
violent
speech
about
the
college
and
the
sinecure
and
what
a
disgraceful
thing
it
was
that
your
brother
a
young
man
could
accept
it
you
do
mean
him
ursula
was
struck
dumb
she
looked
up
at
her
questioner
with
her
lips
falling
apart
a
little
with
a
look
of
mingled
consternation
and
fear
of
course
it
ca
be
said
the
gossip
who
was
not
you
never
read
the
papers
but
your
papa
does
and
so
does
reginald
oh
you
may
be
sure
it
is
some
other
northcote
though
i
do
know
the
name
ursula
does
like
to
tell
you
said
janey
but
he
the
dissenting
minister
i
know
he
is
well
i
do
care
he
is
just
as
good
as
anybody
else
i
do
go
in
for
your
illiberal
ways
of
thinking
as
if
no
one
was
worth
talking
to
except
in
the
church
northcote
is
very
nice
i
do
mind
what
you
say
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
all
those
curates
and
people
who
used
to
plague
our
lives
out
were
nicer
saunders
for
instance
he
is
a
real
good
churchman
i
have
always
heard
people
say
hold
your
tongue
janey
you
do
know
anything
about
it
said
hurst
whom
this
wonderful
disclosure
elevated
into
authority
a
dissenting
minister
ah
me
what
a
thing
it
is
for
you
poor
girls
to
have
no
mother
i
did
not
think
your
papa
would
have
had
so
little
consideration
as
to
expose
you
to
society
like
that
but
men
are
so
thoughtless
i
do
know
what
right
you
have
to
speak
of
exposing
us
to
society
like
that
cried
ursula
quivering
all
over
with
sudden
excitement
she
felt
as
if
some
one
had
dug
a
knife
into
her
and
turned
it
round
in
the
wound
men
have
so
little
consideration
repeated
hurst
especially
when
a
girl
is
concerned
though
how
your
papa
could
have
received
a
man
who
made
such
an
assault
upon
him
even
if
he
had
passed
over
the
attack
upon
reginald
he
was
attacked
himself
it
must
be
a
mistake
said
ursula
growing
pale
her
hands
came
together
and
clasped
in
a
mute
gesture
of
appeal
it
is
not
possible
it
can
not
be
true
well
it
is
very
odd
that
your
papa
should
show
such
charity
i
allow
i
do
think
it
is
in
human
nature
and
reginald
what
does
reginald
say
if
it
is
that
man
it
will
be
the
strangest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
but
there
could
not
be
two
northcotes
dissenting
ministers
in
carlingford
could
there
it
is
very
strange
i
ca
think
what
your
papa
can
have
had
in
his
head
he
is
a
man
who
would
do
a
thing
for
a
deep
reason
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
how
did
this
northcote
come
first
here
oh
it
was
through
copperhead
said
janey
it
was
the
first
we
had
you
should
have
seen
the
fright
ursula
was
in
and
papa
would
not
let
me
come
to
dinner
which
was
a
horrid
shame
i
am
sure
i
am
big
enough
bigger
than
ursula
if
he
came
with
the
pupil
that
makes
it
all
quite
plain
i
suppose
your
papa
did
not
want
to
quarrel
with
his
pupil
what
a
predicament
for
him
if
that
was
the
case
poor
may
of
course
he
did
not
want
to
be
uncivil
why
it
was
in
the
and
the
and
all
the
papers
an
account
of
the
meeting
and
that
speech
and
then
a
leading
article
upon
it
i
always
file
the
so
you
can
see
it
if
you
like
but
what
an
embarrassment
for
your
poor
papa
ursula
that
you
should
have
taken
this
man
up
and
reginald
how
could
he
put
up
with
it
a
touchy
young
man
always
ready
to
take
offence
you
see
now
the
drawback
of
not
paying
a
little
attention
to
what
is
going
on
round
you
how
uncomfortable
you
must
have
made
them
it
might
be
very
well
to
look
over
an
offence
not
to
be
unpleasant
to
the
stranger
but
that
you
should
have
thoughtlessly
led
this
man
on
into
the
position
of
an
intimate
i
did
nothing
of
the
sort
cried
ursula
growing
red
and
growing
pale
starting
up
from
her
work
with
a
sense
of
the
intolerable
which
she
could
not
restrain
what
have
i
done
to
be
spoken
of
so
i
never
led
him
on
or
any
one
what
you
say
is
cruel
very
cruel
and
it
is
not
true
is
it
true
that
he
was
here
last
night
following
you
about
as
janey
says
oh
i
know
how
these
sort
of
things
go
on
but
you
ought
to
think
of
your
papa
position
and
you
ought
to
think
of
reginald
if
it
was
to
come
to
the
bishop
ears
that
roque
parsonage
was
a
refuge
for
dissenters
for
i
know
who
friend
is
ursula
that
tozer
girl
another
of
them
indeed
i
assure
you
it
makes
me
feel
very
uncomfortable
and
reginald
just
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
career
ursula
did
not
make
any
reply
she
bent
her
head
down
over
her
work
so
low
that
her
flushed
cheeks
could
scarcely
be
seen
and
went
on
stitching
with
energy
and
passion
such
as
needles
and
thread
are
seldom
the
instruments
of
and
yet
how
much
passion
is
continually
worked
away
through
needles
and
thread
hurst
sat
still
for
some
time
looking
at
her
very
little
satisfied
to
keep
silence
but
feeling
that
she
had
discharged
an
efficient
missile
and
biting
her
lips
not
to
say
more
to
weaken
its
effect
when
some
time
had
passed
in
this
way
and
it
was
apparent
that
ursula
had
no
intention
of
breaking
the
silence
her
visitor
got
up
and
shook
out
her
skirts
with
a
little
flutter
of
indignation
you
are
offended
she
said
though
i
must
say
it
is
very
ill
on
your
part
to
be
offended
what
motive
can
i
have
but
your
good
and
regard
for
your
poor
dear
papa
it
is
he
that
is
always
the
victim
poor
man
whether
it
is
your
vagaries
he
has
to
pay
for
or
oh
yes
you
may
be
as
angry
as
you
like
ursula
but
you
will
find
out
the
difference
if
your
encouragement
of
this
dissenter
interferes
with
something
better
a
living
for
reginald
perhaps
or
better
preferment
for
your
poor
papa
oh
cried
janey
but
after
all
it
was
not
ursula
it
was
papa
himself
i
think
he
must
have
done
it
to
please
copperhead
for
hurst
you
know
copperhead
is
very
important
we
have
all
to
give
in
to
him
he
pays
papa
three
hundred
three
thousand
would
make
up
for
it
if
it
spoilt
all
your
career
cried
the
indignant
woman
and
she
swept
away
without
saying
any
more
to
ursula
who
kept
quite
still
over
her
work
without
budging
janey
went
downstairs
meekly
after
her
to
open
the
door
whispering
an
entreaty
that
she
would
not
be
angry
no
no
i
am
not
angry
said
hurst
but
i
shall
keep
it
up
for
a
day
or
two
it
is
the
best
thing
for
her
i
think
she
was
struck
with
what
i
said
janey
stole
upstairs
again
feeling
rather
guilty
but
ursula
took
little
notice
of
her
the
dinner
was
ordered
and
everything
settled
for
the
day
she
was
busy
with
her
week
mending
and
darning
with
the
stockings
and
other
things
in
a
big
basket
beside
her
when
she
came
to
some
articles
belonging
to
janey
she
threw
them
out
with
great
impatience
you
may
surely
mend
your
things
yourself
you
are
big
enough
you
can
talk
for
yourself
and
me
too
cried
ursula
with
sudden
impetuosity
and
then
she
sat
and
worked
her
needle
flying
through
the
meshes
of
her
darning
though
it
is
hard
to
darn
stockings
in
that
impassioned
way
they
were
socks
of
johnnie
however
with
holes
in
the
heels
that
you
could
put
your
fist
through
and
the
way
in
which
the
big
spans
filled
themselves
up
under
this
influence
was
wonderful
to
see
janey
who
was
not
fond
of
mending
set
to
work
quite
humbly
under
the
influence
of
this
example
and
made
two
or
three
attempts
to
begin
a
conversation
but
without
avail
the
girls
were
seated
thus
in
a
disturbed
and
restless
silence
working
as
if
for
their
lives
when
the
usual
little
jar
of
the
gate
and
sound
of
the
bell
downstairs
announced
a
visitor
on
ordinary
occasions
they
were
both
in
the
habit
of
rushing
to
the
window
when
the
gate
was
opened
to
see
who
was
coming
and
janey
had
thrown
aside
her
work
to
do
so
when
a
look
from
ursula
stopped
her
as
janey
was
she
did
not
dare
to
disobey
that
look
by
right
of
the
passion
that
had
got
possession
of
her
ursula
took
the
absolute
command
of
the
situation
in
a
way
she
had
never
done
before
and
some
sudden
intuition
made
her
aware
who
it
was
who
was
coming
the
girls
both
sat
there
still
and
breathless
waiting
for
his
appearance
he
never
came
in
the
day
never
had
been
seen
in
the
parsonage
at
that
hour
before
and
yet
ursula
was
as
certain
who
it
was
as
if
she
had
seen
him
a
mile
off
he
came
into
the
room
himself
looking
a
little
breathless
and
disturbed
and
gave
a
quick
impatient
look
at
janey
as
he
went
up
to
her
sister
ursula
saw
it
and
understood
well
enough
janey
was
in
his
way
he
had
come
this
morning
with
a
special
purpose
her
heart
sank
down
to
her
very
shoes
and
then
rose
again
with
a
feverish
and
unreal
leap
was
it
not
her
duty
to
take
the
initiative
to
cut
away
the
very
ground
from
beneath
his
feet
he
took
a
seat
not
far
from
where
she
was
sitting
and
made
an
effort
to
begin
a
little
ordinary
conversation
throwing
frequent
glances
at
janey
he
said
it
was
a
fine
day
which
was
that
he
almost
feared
they
would
be
out
that
he
had
come
to
to
tell
her
something
he
had
forgotten
last
night
about
yes
about
cassiopeia
chair
to
correct
what
he
said
about
orion
yes
that
was
it
and
again
he
looked
at
janey
who
saw
his
looks
and
wondered
much
what
she
ought
to
do
go
away
as
he
evidently
wished
her
or
stay
and
listen
which
was
the
eager
desire
of
her
mind
when
ursula
lifted
her
head
from
her
darning
and
looked
at
him
with
cheeks
alternately
white
and
crimson
janey
felt
herself
grow
hot
and
breathless
with
kindred
excitement
and
knew
that
the
moment
had
come
northcote
said
ursula
looking
at
him
fixedly
so
fixedly
that
a
nervous
trembling
ran
over
him
i
have
a
question
to
ask
you
you
have
been
coming
to
us
very
often
and
perhaps
papa
may
know
but
i
do
is
it
true
that
you
made
a
speech
about
reginald
when
you
first
came
here
janey
looking
eagerly
on
saw
northcote
grow
pale
nay
grey
in
the
fresh
daylight
the
colour
seemed
to
ebb
out
of
him
he
started
very
slightly
as
if
waking
up
when
she
began
to
speak
and
then
sat
looking
at
her
growing
greyer
and
greyer
a
moment
elapsed
before
he
made
any
reply
yes
i
did
he
said
with
a
of
pain
in
his
voice
you
did
really
you
did
oh
cried
ursula
the
hot
tears
falling
suddenly
out
of
her
eyes
while
she
still
looked
at
him
i
was
hoping
that
it
was
all
some
horrible
mistake
that
you
would
have
laughed
i
hoped
you
would
laugh
and
say
no
northcote
cleared
his
throat
they
were
waiting
for
him
to
defend
himself
janey
holding
herself
on
the
leash
as
it
were
keeping
herself
back
from
springing
upon
him
like
a
hound
ursula
gazed
at
him
with
great
blazing
reproachful
eyes
and
all
he
could
do
was
to
give
that
sign
of
embarrassment
of
guilt
and
confusion
he
could
not
utter
a
word
by
the
time
he
had
got
himself
wound
up
to
the
point
of
speech
ursula
impatient
had
taken
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
reginald
is
my
brother
she
said
whatever
is
against
him
is
against
us
all
we
have
never
had
any
separate
interests
did
you
think
it
strange
northcote
to
come
to
this
house
among
us
all
when
you
had
been
so
unkind
to
him
miss
may
he
made
a
broken
sort
of
outcry
and
motion
of
his
head
and
then
cleared
his
throat
nervously
once
more
did
you
think
how
your
own
brothers
and
sisters
would
have
stood
up
for
you
that
it
would
have
been
an
offence
to
them
if
anybody
had
come
to
the
house
who
was
not
a
friend
to
you
that
they
would
have
had
a
right
miss
may
said
the
culprit
all
this
i
have
felt
to
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
i
was
here
on
false
pretences
that
i
had
no
right
to
be
here
but
this
painful
feeling
was
all
quenched
and
extinguished
and
turned
into
gratitude
by
the
goodness
of
your
father
and
brother
i
did
not
even
know
that
you
had
not
been
told
i
thought
you
were
aware
from
the
beginning
you
were
colder
than
they
were
and
i
thought
it
was
natural
quite
natural
for
it
is
easier
to
forgive
for
one
self
than
for
those
one
loves
and
then
i
thought
you
melted
and
grew
kinder
to
me
that
you
saw
how
all
my
ideas
were
changed
all
my
feelings
my
mind
itself
changed
by
the
great
charity
the
wonderful
goodness
i
have
found
here
mr
northcote
ursula
had
been
struggling
to
break
in
all
the
time
but
while
he
spoke
her
words
dispersed
her
feelings
softened
and
at
the
end
she
found
nothing
but
that
startled
repetition
of
his
name
with
which
to
answer
him
no
doubt
if
he
had
given
her
time
the
eloquence
would
have
come
back
but
he
was
too
much
in
earnest
to
be
guilty
of
such
a
mistake
what
can
i
say
about
it
cried
the
young
man
it
has
filled
me
with
shame
and
with
happiness
i
have
been
taken
in
my
own
trap
those
whom
i
attacked
as
you
say
went
out
of
my
way
to
attack
and
abused
like
a
fool
because
i
knew
nothing
about
them
have
shown
me
what
the
bible
means
your
father
and
brother
knew
what
i
had
done
they
met
me
separately
quite
independent
of
each
other
and
both
of
them
held
out
their
hands
to
me
why
except
that
i
had
offended
them
i
can
not
tell
a
stranger
belonging
to
an
obscure
class
i
had
no
claim
upon
them
except
that
i
had
done
what
ought
to
have
closed
their
house
against
me
and
you
know
how
they
have
interpreted
that
they
have
shown
me
what
the
bible
means
the
two
girls
sat
listening
both
with
their
heads
bent
towards
him
and
their
eyes
fixed
upon
his
face
when
he
stopped
janey
got
up
with
her
work
in
her
lap
and
coming
a
little
nearer
to
ursula
addressed
her
in
a
wondering
voice
is
it
he
is
talking
of
like
that
she
said
under
her
breath
yes
he
said
fervently
turning
to
her
it
is
your
father
he
has
made
charity
and
kindness
real
things
to
me
poor
papa
said
ursula
whose
tears
were
arrested
in
her
eyes
by
the
same
surprised
sensation
which
hushed
even
janey
voice
they
were
struck
as
hurst
had
said
but
by
such
a
strange
mingling
of
feelings
that
neither
knew
what
to
make
of
them
northcote
did
not
understand
what
they
meant
their
words
conveyed
a
slight
shock
of
surprise
but
no
distinct
idea
to
him
and
when
janey
too
much
impressed
to
settle
down
again
went
away
after
a
while
musingly
carrying
her
work
in
the
upper
skirt
of
her
gown
held
like
a
apron
by
her
elbow
against
her
side
and
he
found
himself
to
have
attained
in
the
very
confusion
of
his
intentions
to
what
he
wished
an
interview
with
ursula
by
herself
he
was
almost
too
much
agitated
to
take
advantage
of
it
as
for
ursula
she
had
floated
a
hundred
miles
away
from
that
sensation
of
last
night
which
had
no
stronger
feeling
come
in
to
bewilder
her
would
have
made
his
errand
very
plain
to
her
mind
she
had
ceased
to
think
about
him
she
was
thinking
with
a
certain
tenderness
and
wondering
about
her
father
was
he
so
good
as
this
had
he
done
this
christian
action
were
they
all
perhaps
doing
papa
injustice
she
was
recalled
to
herself
by
northcote
next
proceeding
he
went
to
the
door
and
closed
it
after
janey
who
had
left
it
open
of
course
and
then
he
came
to
the
back
of
the
chair
on
which
stood
the
great
basket
of
darning
his
voice
was
tremulous
his
eyes
liquid
and
shining
with
emotion
will
you
forgive
me
since
they
have
forgiven
me
and
may
i
ask
something
he
said
chapter
xxxiv
an
extravagance
may
did
not
take
any
particular
notice
of
what
was
going
on
around
him
among
the
young
people
nobody
could
have
been
more
startled
than
he
had
he
been
told
of
the
purpose
with
which
horace
northcote
the
dissenting
minister
had
paid
his
early
morning
visit
and
though
he
had
a
glimmer
of
insight
into
the
feelings
of
his
son
and
saw
that
clarence
copperhead
was
heavily
veering
the
same
way
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
any
crisis
was
approaching
he
was
enjoying
himself
in
his
way
and
he
had
not
done
that
for
a
long
time
he
dearly
liked
the
better
way
of
living
the
more
liberal
strain
of
housekeeping
and
expenditure
he
liked
the
social
meetings
in
the
evening
the
talk
after
dinner
with
the
three
young
men
the
flirtation
with
phoebe
which
she
too
enjoyed
much
avowedly
preferring
him
with
pretty
coquetry
to
the
others
all
this
was
very
pleasant
to
him
and
the
additional
money
in
his
pocket
was
very
pleasant
and
when
the
post
came
in
one
of
these
april
mornings
and
brought
a
letter
from
james
enclosing
a
draft
for
fifty
pounds
his
satisfaction
was
intense
the
sight
of
the
money
brought
an
itching
to
his
fingers
a
restlessness
about
him
generally
and
yet
it
was
not
all
that
might
have
been
desired
only
fifty
pounds
he
had
been
buoying
himself
up
by
vain
thoughts
of
how
james
this
time
having
been
so
long
writing
would
send
a
larger
sum
which
would
at
once
tide
him
over
the
tozer
business
and
on
this
account
had
been
giving
himself
no
trouble
about
it
never
before
had
he
been
so
although
never
before
had
the
risk
been
so
great
he
had
suffered
so
much
about
it
last
time
probably
that
was
why
he
took
it
so
easily
now
or
was
it
because
his
trust
in
the
chapter
of
accidents
had
grown
greater
since
he
was
more
dependent
on
it
or
because
of
the
generally
expanded
sense
of
living
in
him
which
made
anxiety
uncongenial
anyhow
whatever
the
cause
was
this
was
the
effect
a
momentary
disappointment
when
he
saw
how
little
james
draft
was
then
a
sense
of
that
which
comes
upon
a
poor
man
when
a
sum
of
money
falls
into
his
hands
gradually
invaded
his
soul
he
tried
to
settle
down
to
his
writing
but
did
not
feel
equal
to
the
effort
it
was
too
little
for
the
purpose
he
said
to
himself
for
which
he
wanted
it
but
it
was
enough
to
do
a
great
many
pleasant
things
with
otherwise
for
the
first
time
he
had
no
urgent
bills
to
swallow
it
up
the
very
grocer
a
tradesman
who
made
less
fuss
than
the
others
and
about
whom
ursula
made
less
fuss
had
been
pacified
by
a
payment
on
account
of
the
copperhead
money
and
thus
had
his
mouth
stopped
barring
that
bill
indeed
things
were
in
a
more
comfortable
state
than
they
had
been
for
a
long
time
in
the
may
household
and
putting
that
out
of
account
james
money
would
have
been
the
nearest
approach
to
luxury
reckoning
luxury
in
its
most
simple
form
as
money
to
spend
without
any
absolutely
forestalling
claim
upon
it
which
may
had
known
for
years
it
is
so
seldom
that
poor
people
have
this
delicious
sense
of
a
little
ever
so
little
surplus
and
it
would
be
hard
to
say
how
he
could
entertain
the
feeling
that
it
was
an
overplus
there
was
something
of
the
fumes
of
desperation
perhaps
and
impending
fate
in
the
lightness
of
heart
which
seized
upon
him
he
could
not
keep
still
over
his
writing
he
got
up
at
last
and
put
james
draft
into
his
and
got
his
hat
to
go
out
it
was
a
fine
morning
full
of
that
exhilaration
which
belongs
only
to
the
spring
he
went
to
the
bank
and
paid
in
the
money
getting
a
small
sum
at
the
same
time
for
his
own
immediate
use
but
somehow
his
restlessness
was
scarcely
satisfied
by
that
very
legitimate
piece
of
business
and
he
extended
his
walk
into
the
town
and
strayed
half
by
chance
half
by
intention
to
the
old
furniture
shop
at
the
other
end
of
the
high
street
which
was
a
favourite
resort
of
the
higher
classes
in
carlingford
and
where
periodically
there
was
an
auction
at
which
sometimes
great
bargains
were
to
be
had
may
went
into
this
dangerous
place
boldly
the
sale
was
going
on
he
walked
into
the
midst
of
temptation
forgetting
the
prayer
against
it
which
no
doubt
he
had
said
that
morning
and
as
evil
fate
would
have
it
a
carved
the
very
thing
he
had
been
sighing
for
for
years
was
at
that
moment
the
object
of
the
auctioneer
praises
it
was
standing
against
the
wall
a
noble
piece
of
furniture
in
which
books
would
show
to
an
advantage
impossible
otherwise
preserved
from
dust
and
damp
by
the
fine
old
oak
and
glass
door
may
heart
gave
a
little
jump
almost
everybody
has
wished
for
something
unattainable
and
this
had
been
the
object
of
his
desires
for
years
he
gave
a
little
start
when
he
saw
it
and
hurried
forward
the
bidding
had
actually
begun
there
was
no
time
to
think
and
consider
if
he
wished
to
have
a
chance
and
it
was
going
cheap
dead
cheap
after
a
minute
or
two
of
competition
the
blood
rose
to
his
cheeks
he
got
thoroughly
excited
the
effect
of
this
excitement
was
not
only
did
it
drive
all
thought
of
prudence
out
of
his
head
but
it
raised
by
several
pounds
the
price
of
the
which
had
he
gone
about
it
coolly
he
might
have
had
at
a
much
cheaper
rate
when
he
suddenly
woke
up
to
find
himself
the
owner
of
it
a
thrill
of
consternation
ran
over
him
it
was
all
so
sudden
and
it
was
perfectly
innocent
if
only
he
had
any
money
and
to
be
sure
he
had
james
money
which
was
not
enough
to
do
anything
else
certainly
not
to
do
the
thing
he
wanted
it
for
he
tried
to
laugh
at
himself
for
the
little
thrill
of
alarm
that
ran
through
him
but
it
was
too
late
to
recede
and
he
gave
his
cheque
for
the
money
and
his
directions
as
to
having
it
sent
to
the
parsonage
with
a
quake
at
his
heart
yet
a
little
flourish
of
satisfaction
just
what
i
have
been
wanting
for
years
he
said
as
he
examined
his
new
acquisition
and
the
people
about
looked
at
him
with
additional
respect
he
felt
not
being
used
to
see
may
so
prompt
in
payment
and
so
ready
with
his
money
this
pleased
him
also
he
walked
home
with
his
head
a
little
turned
still
although
there
was
a
quake
and
flutter
underneath
well
he
said
to
himself
who
could
call
it
an
extravagance
a
thing
he
had
wanted
for
years
a
thing
which
was
a
necessity
not
for
luxury
but
everyday
use
a
thing
which
was
not
dear
and
which
was
very
handsome
and
substantial
and
how
could
any
one
say
it
was
extravagant
ursula
might
stare
with
her
big
eyes
but
she
was
only
a
silly
little
girl
and
women
always
were
silly
about
expenses
alarmed
by
a
big
bold
handsome
purchase
though
there
was
nobody
better
at
the
art
of
frittering
away
money
in
pretty
nothings
when
he
got
home
he
began
at
once
nervously
to
clear
the
space
where
it
should
stand
what
an
improvement
it
would
be
and
his
books
were
getting
spoiled
daily
in
those
unsightly
open
shelves
entirely
spoiled
it
was
exciting
to
anticipate
its
arrival
and
the
admiration
and
commotion
in
the
house
he
called
in
betsy
and
gave
her
orders
about
it
how
if
it
came
when
he
was
absent
it
was
to
be
put
in
that
particular
place
no
other
and
mind
that
great
care
is
taken
for
it
is
valuable
and
a
beautiful
piece
of
furniture
he
said
la
sir
said
betsy
who
was
thunderstruck
though
she
knew
it
was
not
her
place
to
show
any
feeling
he
did
not
think
it
was
necessary
to
appeal
to
ursula
on
the
same
subject
but
was
rather
glad
to
get
out
again
feeling
the
restlessness
which
had
not
been
dissipated
but
rather
the
reverse
he
went
and
saw
one
or
two
poor
people
to
whom
he
was
much
more
tolerant
and
kind
than
his
wont
for
in
general
may
was
not
attracted
towards
the
poor
and
he
gave
them
a
shilling
or
two
of
the
money
he
had
drawn
at
the
bank
that
morning
though
somehow
it
had
acquired
a
certain
value
in
his
eyes
and
it
was
with
a
grudge
that
he
took
it
out
of
his
pocket
i
must
not
spend
this
he
said
to
himself
but
gave
the
shillings
as
a
kind
of
tithe
or
propitiatory
offering
to
providence
that
things
might
go
well
with
him
why
should
not
things
go
well
with
him
he
was
not
a
bad
man
he
wronged
nobody
he
had
done
nothing
that
a
saint
might
not
have
done
he
wanted
the
and
he
had
the
money
a
sum
not
big
enough
for
any
more
important
purpose
but
which
was
far
better
disposed
of
so
than
frittered
away
in
nothings
as
no
doubt
it
would
have
otherwise
been
by
the
afternoon
when
the
arrived
he
had
convinced
himself
that
it
was
not
only
quite
reasonable
but
a
most
lucky
chance
a
thing
he
could
scarcely
have
hoped
for
the
opportunity
and
the
money
both
coming
in
such
exact
accord
with
each
other
when
he
returned
from
his
walk
the
girls
were
looking
at
it
ursula
somewhat
scared
janey
in
open
raptures
it
is
very
nice
indeed
papa
said
the
elder
girl
but
it
must
have
cost
a
deal
of
money
be
thankful
that
you
have
got
to
pay
for
it
he
said
brusquely
he
was
not
disposed
to
stand
criticism
how
it
filled
up
his
bare
room
and
made
it
may
thought
all
at
once
into
a
library
though
the
old
and
shabby
chairs
looked
rather
worse
perhaps
than
before
and
suggested
renewal
in
the
most
urgent
way
to
make
it
all
of
a
piece
to
put
a
soft
turkey
carpet
instead
of
the
drugget
how
pleasant
it
would
be
not
extravagant
only
a
natural
inclination
towards
the
seemly
and
a
desire
to
have
things
around
him
becoming
his
position
no
doubt
such
things
were
things
which
he
ought
to
have
in
his
position
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
how
humiliating
it
was
that
nothing
but
the
barest
elements
of
comfort
should
be
within
his
reach
this
was
not
how
life
ought
to
be
a
poor
creature
like
clarence
copperhead
without
birth
or
breeding
or
brains
or
anything
but
money
was
able
to
gratify
every
wish
while
he
his
senior
his
superior
instead
of
blaming
himself
therefore
for
his
may
sympathized
with
himself
which
is
a
much
less
safe
thing
to
do
and
accordingly
it
soon
began
to
appear
to
him
that
his
all
this
time
in
not
giving
himself
what
he
wanted
had
been
extreme
and
that
what
he
had
now
done
in
conceding
himself
so
harmless
a
gratification
was
what
he
ought
to
have
done
years
ago
it
was
his
own
money
sent
to
him
by
his
dutiful
son
without
conditions
and
who
had
any
right
to
interfere
when
he
was
at
dinner
betsy
came
behind
his
chair
under
pretence
of
serving
him
betsy
whose
place
was
in
the
kitchen
who
had
no
right
to
show
in
the
at
all
and
whose
confused
toilette
had
caught
ursula
eye
and
filled
her
with
horror
please
sir
she
said
breathing
hot
on
may
ear
till
he
shrank
with
sensitive
horror
cotsdean
in
the
kitchen
he
says
as
how
he
must
see
you
and
i
ca
get
him
away
ah
cotsdean
tell
him
if
he
has
anything
to
say
to
me
to
write
it
down
which
he
done
sir
said
betsy
producing
a
little
bit
of
paper
rolled
tightly
together
but
i
was
to
give
it
till
i
asked
you
to
see
him
oh
please
see
him
sir
like
a
dear
good
gentleman
he
looks
like
a
man
as
is
going
off
his
head
he
is
a
fool
said
may
taking
the
paper
but
setting
his
teeth
as
he
did
so
evidently
he
must
get
rid
of
this
fellow
already
beginning
to
trouble
him
as
if
he
was
not
the
best
person
to
know
when
and
how
far
he
could
go
tell
him
i
attend
to
it
he
need
not
trouble
himself
he
said
and
put
the
paper
into
his
pocket
and
went
on
with
his
dinner
cotsdean
indeed
surely
there
had
been
enough
of
him
what
were
his
trumpery
losses
in
comparison
with
what
his
principal
would
lose
and
how
dare
that
fellow
turn
up
thus
and
press
him
continually
for
his
own
poor
selfish
safety
this
was
not
how
may
had
felt
three
months
before
but
everything
changes
and
he
felt
that
he
had
a
right
to
be
angry
at
this
selfish
solicitude
surely
it
was
of
as
much
consequence
to
him
at
least
as
to
cotsdean
the
man
was
a
fussy
disagreeable
fool
and
nothing
more
and
as
it
happened
they
sat
late
that
night
at
dinner
without
any
particular
reason
because
of
some
discussion
into
which
clarence
and
reginald
fell
so
that
it
was
late
before
may
got
back
to
his
room
where
his
books
were
lying
in
a
heap
waiting
their
transportation
they
seemed
to
appeal
to
him
also
and
ask
him
reproachfully
how
they
had
got
there
and
he
went
to
work
arranging
them
all
with
all
the
enthusiasm
natural
to
a
lover
of
books
he
was
a
a
man
full
of
fine
tastes
and
cultured
elegant
ways
of
thinking
if
he
had
been
extravagant
which
he
was
not
it
would
have
been
in
the
most
innocent
nay
delightful
and
laudable
way
to
attach
any
notion
of
criminality
any
suspicion
of
to
such
a
virtuous
indulgence
how
unjust
it
would
be
there
was
no
company
upstairs
that
evening
copperhead
had
strolled
out
with
reginald
to
smoke
his
cigar
much
against
the
will
of
the
latter
and
was
boring
him
all
the
way
to
the
college
with
accounts
of
his
own
lavish
expenditure
and
how
much
he
had
given
for
this
and
that
his
cameos
his
diamond
studs
the
magnificent
which
was
the
wonder
of
the
parsonage
hang
it
all
what
is
the
good
of
having
money
if
you
do
spend
it
said
clarence
and
reginald
who
had
not
much
money
to
spend
felt
as
near
hating
him
as
it
was
in
his
nature
to
do
thus
may
was
released
from
duty
in
the
where
ursula
palpitating
with
many
thoughts
which
were
altogether
new
to
her
sat
doing
her
darning
and
eluding
as
well
as
she
could
questions
janey
was
determinedly
conversational
that
night
she
drove
ursula
nearly
out
of
her
senses
and
kept
johnnie
who
had
crept
into
the
in
high
delight
at
finding
it
for
once
free
to
him
from
learning
his
lessons
oh
how
nice
it
is
to
be
by
ourselves
said
janey
instead
of
all
those
new
people
i
do
mind
phoebe
but
strange
men
in
the
house
what
a
nuisance
they
are
always
getting
in
one
way
do
you
think
so
ursula
ursula
made
no
reply
and
after
awhile
even
janey
sank
into
silence
and
the
usually
so
gay
got
a
cold
and
deserted
look
the
new
life
which
had
come
in
had
left
its
mark
and
to
go
back
to
what
had
once
been
so
pleasant
in
the
past
was
no
longer
possible
johnnie
and
janey
might
like
it
having
regained
their
former
places
but
to
ursula
the
solitude
was
horrible
she
asked
herself
with
a
great
blush
and
quiver
what
she
would
do
if
that
temporary
filling
up
of
new
interests
and
relationships
was
to
fall
away
as
was
likely
and
leave
her
to
the
old
life
unbroken
to
janey
childish
society
and
questions
and
imperious
and
unmodified
sway
she
grew
pale
and
chill
at
the
very
thought
but
may
as
we
have
said
was
off
duty
he
forgot
all
about
cotsdean
and
the
note
in
his
pocket
and
set
to
work
with
the
most
boyish
simplicity
of
delight
to
arrange
his
books
in
his
new
shelves
how
well
they
looked
never
before
had
their
setting
done
them
justice
there
were
books
in
gorgeous
bindings
college
prizes
which
had
never
shown
at
all
and
which
now
gleamed
out
in
crimson
and
gold
from
behind
the
glass
and
made
their
owner
heart
beat
with
pleasure
alas
to
think
how
much
innocent
pleasure
is
denied
us
by
the
want
of
that
small
sum
of
money
and
worse
still
how
an
innocent
pleasure
becomes
the
reverse
of
innocent
when
it
is
purchased
by
the
appropriation
of
something
which
should
have
been
employed
elsewhere
perhaps
however
the
sense
of
guilt
which
he
kept
under
added
zest
in
may
mind
to
the
pleasure
of
his
acquisition
he
was
snatching
a
fearful
joy
heaven
knows
how
soon
the
penalty
might
overwhelm
him
in
the
mean
time
he
was
determined
to
take
the
good
of
it
and
enjoy
what
he
had
gained
when
the
books
were
all
in
he
sat
down
at
his
table
and
surveyed
it
rubbing
his
dusty
hands
how
much
that
is
childish
how
much
that
is
fresh
and
youthful
and
innocent
must
be
in
the
mind
of
a
man
you
would
say
who
could
be
thus
excited
about
a
and
yet
this
was
not
the
kind
of
man
whom
you
would
call
unsophisticated
and
youthful
it
was
probably
the
state
of
suppressed
excitement
in
which
he
was
the
unreality
of
his
position
that
helped
him
to
that
sense
of
elation
as
much
as
anything
else
for
emotion
is
a
proteus
ready
to
take
any
form
and
pain
itself
sometimes
finds
vent
in
the
quick
blazing
up
of
fictitious
delight
as
much
as
in
the
moanings
that
seem
more
accordant
with
its
own
nature
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
for
his
pencil
to
make
a
note
of
the
contents
of
the
new
shelves
and
then
he
found
cotsdean
note
which
he
had
not
forgotten
but
which
he
had
felt
no
desire
to
remember
when
he
felt
it
between
his
fingers
his
countenance
fell
a
little
but
he
took
it
out
and
read
it
with
the
smile
still
upon
his
face
it
was
a
dirty
little
roll
of
paper
scribbled
in
pencil

a
delicate
little
thing
sir
thankye
sir
said
betsy
by
her
master
amiability
and
he
smiled
and
repeated
tell
him
it
all
right
was
it
all
right
the
cotsdean
must
have
made
a
mistake
countenance
paled
and
the
laugh
went
off
he
opened
a
drawer
in
his
and
took
out
a
book
and
anxiously
consulted
an
entry
in
it
it
was
the
certainly
as
clear
as
possible
something
had
been
written
on
the
opposite
page
and
had
blotted
slightly
the
one
on
which
these
entries
were
written
but
there
it
stood
the
april
may
prided
himself
on
making
no
mistakes
in
business
he
closed
the
book
again
with
a
look
of
relief
the
smile
coming
back
once
more
to
his
face
the
it
was
three
days
additional
and
in
the
time
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
would
find
out
what
was
the
right
thing
to
do
chapter
xxxv
the
millionnaire
when
may
woke
next
morning
it
was
not
the
he
thought
of
but
that
date
which
had
been
the
last
thing
in
his
mind
on
the
previous
night
not
the
the
certainly
he
was
right
and
cotsdean
was
wrong
cotsdean
was
a
being
making
his
calculations
by
the
rule
of
thumb
but
he
had
put
down
the
date
and
there
could
be
no
possible
mistake
about
it
he
got
up
disposed
to
smile
at
the
poor
ignorance
and
fussy
restlessness
of
mind
i
have
never
left
him
in
the
lurch
he
may
trust
to
me
surely
in
the
future
may
said
to
himself
and
smiled
with
a
kind
of
condescending
pity
for
his
poor
agent
timidity
after
all
perhaps
as
cotsdean
had
so
little
profit
by
it
it
was
not
wonderful
that
he
should
be
uneasy
after
this
it
might
be
well
if
they
did
anything
further
of
the
sort
to
divide
the
money
so
that
cotsdean
too
might
feel
that
he
had
got
something
for
the
risk
he
ran
but
then
to
be
sure
if
he
had
not
the
money
he
had
no
trouble
except
by
his
own
foolish
anxiety
for
the
payment
and
always
a
note
or
two
for
his
pains
but
may
said
to
himself
that
he
would
do
no
more
in
this
way
after
the
present
bill
was
disposed
of
no
he
would
make
a
stand
he
would
insist
upon
living
within
his
income
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
subject
to
these
perpetual
agitations
any
more
it
would
require
an
effort
but
after
the
effort
was
made
all
would
be
easy
so
he
said
to
himself
and
it
was
the
not
the
three
days
more
to
make
his
arrangements
in
it
had
come
to
be
the
now
and
up
to
this
moment
he
had
done
nothing
having
that
vague
faith
in
the
indian
mail
which
had
been
realized
and
yet
had
not
been
realized
but
still
he
had
nearly
a
week
before
him
which
was
enough
certainly
anything
that
he
could
do
in
six
months
he
said
to
himself
he
could
easily
do
in
six
days
the
mere
time
was
nothing
and
he
smiled
as
he
dressed
himself
leisurely
thinking
it
all
over
somehow
everything
looked
perfectly
easy
to
him
this
time
last
time
he
had
been
plunged
into
tragic
despair
now
and
he
did
not
know
why
he
took
it
quite
easily
he
seemed
to
fear
nothing
there
were
various
ways
of
getting
the
money
as
natural
as
the
daylight
and
in
the
mean
time
why
should
he
make
himself
unhappy
as
soon
as
he
was
ready
he
went
to
his
room
and
had
another
look
at
the
which
with
his
best
books
in
it
all
in
order
and
ranged
in
unbroken
lines
looked
everything
a
ought
to
look
it
made
him
feel
more
of
a
man
somehow
more
like
the
gentleman
and
scholar
he
had
meant
to
be
when
he
started
in
life
he
had
not
intended
then
to
be
a
poor
district
incumbent
all
his
life
with
a
family
of
eight
children
his
somehow
transported
him
back
to
the
days
when
he
had
thought
of
better
things
for
himself
and
when
life
had
held
an
ideal
for
him
perhaps
at
the
best
of
times
it
had
never
been
a
very
high
ideal
but
when
a
man
is
over
fifty
and
has
given
up
doing
anything
but
struggle
through
each
day
as
it
comes
and
get
out
of
his
work
as
best
he
may
doing
what
he
must
leaving
undone
what
he
can
any
ideal
almost
seems
something
higher
than
himself
but
the
recollection
of
what
he
had
meant
to
be
came
back
to
him
strongly
when
he
looked
at
his
carved
oak
it
had
not
been
carried
out
but
still
he
felt
rehabilitated
and
better
in
his
own
opinion
as
he
stood
beside
this
costly
purchase
he
had
made
and
felt
that
it
changed
his
room
and
all
his
surroundings
it
might
have
been
almost
wicked
to
run
into
such
an
extravagance
but
yet
it
did
him
good
my
people
came
down
to
the
hall
last
night
clarence
copperhead
said
to
him
at
breakfast
and
the
governor
is
coming
over
along
with
sir
robert
he
like
to
see
you
i
am
sure
and
i
suppose
they
be
going
in
for
and
that
sort
of
thing
he
is
a
dab
at
is
the
governor
i
ca
think
how
he
can
stand
it
for
my
part
then
you
must
remember
that
i
put
myself
at
his
orders
for
the
day
said
may
graciously
sir
robert
is
not
a
bad
guide
but
i
am
a
better
though
it
sounds
modest
to
say
it
and
ursula
of
course
copperhead
will
take
luncheon
with
us
do
think
of
that
said
clarence
he
queer
and
likes
his
own
way
just
as
likely
as
not
he
think
he
ought
to
support
the
hotels
of
the
place
where
he
is
sort
of
local
production
you
know
i
think
nonsense
but
that
is
how
it
is
that
the
man
we
shall
look
for
him
all
the
same
said
may
with
a
nod
at
ursula
and
a
sudden
project
sprang
up
in
his
mind
wild
as
projects
so
often
are
this
father
whom
his
fancy
working
upon
what
clarence
said
immediately
invested
with
all
the
prodigal
liberality
of
a
typical
rich
man
this
stranger
to
whom
a
hundred
pounds
was
less
then
a
penny
was
to
himself
would
give
him
the
money
he
wanted
what
so
easy
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
though
he
had
not
been
aware
that
he
was
anxious
he
was
suddenly
conscious
of
a
sense
of
relief
yes
to
be
sure
what
so
simple
what
so
likely
he
would
explain
his
monetary
necessities
lightly
and
with
grace
and
copperhead
would
supply
them
he
was
in
the
mildest
state
of
desperation
the
painless
stage
as
may
be
seen
when
this
strange
idea
entered
into
his
head
he
hugged
it
though
he
was
a
man
of
the
world
and
might
have
known
better
and
it
produced
a
kind
of
elation
which
would
have
been
a
very
strange
spectacle
to
any
who
knew
what
it
meant
the
thing
seemed
done
when
he
next
thought
of
it
ten
minutes
later
settled
as
if
it
had
been
so
for
years
copperhead
would
make
it
all
right
for
him
and
after
that
he
would
undertake
such
risks
no
more
copperhead
however
did
not
come
for
two
days
though
ursula
spent
all
the
morning
and
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
arranging
a
luncheon
for
him
but
on
the
second
morning
he
came
driven
by
sir
robert
who
had
changed
horses
on
the
road
and
who
was
in
a
somewhat
irritated
and
excited
condition
very
glad
to
get
rid
of
his
visitor
i
hope
you
do
mind
having
your
toes
trodden
on
may
he
said
privately
that
fellow
is
never
happy
but
when
he
insulting
some
one
and
indeed
copperhead
began
this
favourite
pastime
at
once
by
making
very
big
eyes
at
the
sight
of
ursula
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
and
elevating
his
eyebrows
and
he
gave
a
meaning
laugh
as
he
shook
hands
with
her
and
declared
that
he
did
not
expect
to
find
young
ladies
here
i
have
a
great
deal
of
education
myself
and
i
never
knew
it
could
be
carried
on
so
pleasantly
he
said
you
a
lucky
young
dog
clar
that
what
you
are
and
the
son
laughed
with
the
father
at
this
excellent
joke
though
the
rest
of
the
company
looked
on
with
great
gravity
ursula
for
her
part
turned
with
wondering
eyes
from
the
to
her
old
friend
sir
robert
what
does
he
mean
she
asked
with
an
appealing
look
he
is
the
greatest
brute
i
know
said
poor
sir
robert
under
his
breath
and
he
went
off
suddenly
on
the
plea
of
business
leaving
his
unpleasant
visitor
in
may
hands
who
undertook
the
charge
not
unwillingly
being
possessed
by
his
own
plan
copperhead
went
all
over
carlingford
he
inspected
the
the
infirmary
and
the
church
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
doing
his
duty
poor
little
place
but
well
enough
for
the
country
he
said
a
a
mistake
in
my
opinion
if
i
had
it
in
my
power
i
raze
them
all
to
the
ground
and
have
one
london
and
the
rest
green
fields
that
your
sort
may
now
you
do
produce
anything
here
the
good
of
you
all
unproductive
communities
sir
ought
to
be
swept
off
the
face
of
the
earth
i
let
manchester
and
those
sort
of
places
go
on
till
they
burst
but
a
bit
of
a
little
piggery
like
this
where
there
nothing
doing
no
trade
no
productions
of
any
kind
we
like
it
all
the
same
said
may
we
small
sort
of
people
who
have
no
enterprise
like
you
i
dare
say
you
like
it
to
be
sure
you
can
moon
about
here
as
much
as
you
please
and
make
believe
to
do
something
and
there
nobody
to
contradict
you
in
a
great
centre
of
industry
you
could
live
like
that
you
must
work
or
you
get
pushed
aside
altogether
unless
of
course
you
a
millionnaire
to
start
with
copperhead
added
with
a
noisy
laugh
which
i
am
not
certainly
very
much
the
reverse
in
short
a
poor
man
with
a
large
family
which
i
suppose
is
a
thing
about
as
objectionable
in
a
centre
of
industry
as
anything
can
be
the
large
family
ai
objectionable
if
you
make
work
said
copperhead
it
all
depends
on
that
there
always
objections
you
know
he
said
with
a
jocular
grin
to
pretty
girls
like
that
daughter
of
yours
put
straight
in
a
young
fellow
way
you
wo
mind
my
saying
it
they
neither
work
themselves
nor
let
others
work
that
sort
i
think
we
could
get
on
with
a
deal
fewer
women
i
must
allow
there
where
providence
is
in
a
mistake
we
do
want
in
england
it
a
waste
of
raw
material
they
bad
for
the
men
and
they
ai
much
good
for
themselves
that
i
can
see
you
are
a
little
hard
upon
the
ladies
mr
copperhead
not
i
we
ca
do
without
of
course
and
the
surplus
we
ought
to
export
as
we
export
other
surpluses
but
i
object
to
them
in
a
young
man
way
not
meaning
anything
unpleasant
to
you
and
perhaps
if
i
had
been
put
up
to
it
sooner
but
let
hope
there
no
mischief
done
what
is
this
now
some
of
your
antiquities
i
suppose
oh
yes
let
have
a
look
at
it
but
i
confess
it
the
present
age
i
like
best
this
is
the
college
cried
may
swallowing
certain
sensations
which
impaired
his
sense
of
friendliness
but
not
an
educational
college
a
foundation
for
old
men
decayed
citizens
as
they
are
called
founded
in
the
fifteenth
century
my
son
is
the
chaplain
and
will
be
very
glad
to
show
it
you
there
are
twelve
old
men
here
at
present
very
comfortably
looked
after
thanks
to
the
liberal
arrangements
of
the
founder
they
attend
chapel
twice
a
day
where
reginald
officiates
it
is
very
agreeable
to
me
to
have
him
settled
so
near
me
cunning
i
call
it
said
copperhead
with
his
hoarse
laugh
does
you
credit
a
capital
snug
nest
nothing
to
do
and
pay
pay
good
now
those
old
fellows
generally
managed
that
as
it
was
priests
that
had
the
doing
of
it
of
course
they
did
well
for
their
own
kind
good
lord
what
a
waste
of
good
money
all
this
is
he
continued
as
they
went
into
the
quadrangle
and
saw
the
little
park
beyond
with
its
few
fine
trees
nice
villas
might
be
built
on
this
site
and
it
just
the
sort
of
place
i
should
fancy
where
villas
would
pay
why
do
the
corporation
lay
hands
on
it
and
your
son
lives
here
too
dull
for
me
i
like
a
little
movement
going
on
but
i
dare
say
he
likes
it
and
with
how
much
a
year
two
hundred
and
fifty
and
some
advantages
beside
bravo
said
copperhead
now
how
many
curates
could
you
get
for
that
two
and
i
got
a
great
respect
for
you
may
you
know
what
what
that
shows
sense
that
does
how
do
you
do
sir
fine
old
place
you
got
here
capital
snug
appointment
i
just
been
saying
to
your
father
i
admire
his
sense
looking
out
for
you
a
nice
fat
easy
appointment
like
this
reginald
turned
from
red
to
white
and
then
to
portentous
blackness
the
subject
was
of
all
others
the
one
least
likely
to
please
him
it
is
not
very
fat
he
said
with
a
look
of
offence
quite
undeserved
by
the
chief
sufferer
towards
his
father
nor
very
easy
but
come
in
it
is
rather
an
interesting
old
place
i
suppose
you
would
like
to
see
the
chapel
and
the
old
captain
rooms
they
are
very
fine
in
their
way
thank
you
we
been
seeing
a
deal
already
and
i
feel
tired
i
think
i
let
you
off
the
chapel
hallo
here
another
old
friend
northcote
by
george
and
what
are
doing
here
i
should
like
to
know
a
blazing
young
screamer
of
the
liberation
society
in
a
high
and
dry
parson
rooms
this
is
as
good
as
a
play
i
suppose
one
is
not
required
to
stay
at
exactly
the
same
point
of
opinion
all
one
life
said
northcote
with
a
by
george
but
you
are
though
when
you
a
public
man
especially
when
you
on
a
crusade
have
i
heard
you
call
it
a
crusade
i
can
tell
you
that
changing
your
opinion
is
just
the
very
last
thing
the
public
will
permit
you
to
do
but
i
sha
tell
for
my
part
make
yourself
easy
clarence
do
you
let
it
out
your
mother
fortunately
is
out
of
the
way
the
world
shall
never
know
through
me
that
young
northcote
the
churchman
was
discovered
with
a
snug
chaplain
in
a
sinecure
appointment
ha
ha
had
you
there
to
do
northcote
justice
said
may
he
began
life
in
carlingford
by
pointing
out
this
fact
to
the
neighbourhood
that
it
was
a
sinecure
and
that
my
son
and
i
would
it
not
be
more
to
the
point
to
inspect
the
chapel
said
reginald
who
had
been
standing
by
impatiently
playing
with
a
big
key
upon
which
copperhead
laughed
more
loudly
than
before
we
not
trouble
the
chapel
he
said
railway
stations
are
more
in
my
way
you
are
all
a
great
deal
finer
than
i
am
and
know
a
deal
more
i
suppose
but
my
roughness
has
served
its
purpose
on
the
whole
better
perhaps
for
some
things
yes
for
some
things
clar
and
you
may
thank
your
stars
old
boy
if
you
had
been
a
parson
son
by
george
there
would
have
been
no
fat
appointment
waiting
for
you
after
all
my
son
appointment
is
not
so
very
fat
said
may
forcing
a
laugh
it
is
not
so
much
as
many
a
boy
at
school
gets
from
his
father
ah
you
mean
my
boy
at
school
he
an
extravagant
dog
his
mother
and
he
sir
are
made
of
different
clay
from
me
they
are
porcelain
and
i
am
delft
they
want
fine
velvet
cupboards
to
stand
themselves
in
while
for
the
kitchen
dresser
that
the
difference
but
i
can
afford
it
thank
heaven
i
tell
clarence
that
he
may
thank
his
stars
that
i
can
afford
it
and
that
he
is
born
a
poor
man
son
he
has
been
plucked
at
oxford
you
know
he
said
with
a
big
laugh
thrusting
forth
his
chest
as
clarence
thrust
forth
his
with
an
apparent
complacency
over
the
very
plucking
my
son
can
afford
to
be
plucked
he
seemed
to
say
he
got
up
as
he
spoke
and
approaching
the
fireplace
turned
his
back
to
it
and
gathered
up
his
under
his
arm
he
was
no
taller
than
may
and
very
little
taller
than
reginald
but
they
both
shrank
into
insignificance
beside
the
big
figure
he
looked
about
the
room
as
if
he
was
thinking
of
buying
up
the
whole
contents
of
it
and
thought
very
little
of
them
a
glance
of
contempt
a
shrug
more
implied
than
actual
testified
his
low
opinion
of
everything
around
when
he
withdrew
his
eyes
from
the
furniture
he
shook
out
his
leg
as
clarence
had
done
his
and
gave
a
pull
to
his
trousers
that
they
might
sit
properly
he
had
the
word
rich
painted
in
big
letters
all
over
him
and
he
seemed
to
feel
it
his
vocation
to
show
this
sense
of
superiority
clarence
by
his
side
the
living
copy
of
the
great
man
appearance
and
manners
strutted
and
put
himself
forward
like
his
father
as
a
big
calf
might
place
itself
beside
the
parent
cow
copperhead
did
not
look
upon
his
offspring
however
with
the
motherly
complacency
he
laughed
at
him
openly
with
cynical
amusement
he
was
clever
in
his
way
and
clarence
was
stupid
and
besides
he
was
the
proprietor
and
clarence
for
all
he
was
porcelain
was
his
goods
and
chattels
when
he
looked
at
him
a
wicked
leer
of
derision
awoke
in
his
eye
yes
my
boy
he
said
thank
your
stars
you
would
not
make
much
of
it
if
you
were
a
poor
man
you
an
ornament
that
costs
dear
but
i
can
afford
you
so
northcote
you
changing
your
opinions
going
over
to
the
church
eh
extremes
meet
they
say
i
should
have
thought
it
i
am
doing
nothing
of
the
kind
said
northcote
stoutly
he
was
not
in
a
mood
to
be
taken
to
task
by
this
mammon
of
unrighteousness
and
indeed
had
at
all
times
been
a
great
deal
too
independent
and
unwilling
to
submit
to
leading
members
of
the
connection
copperhead
however
showed
no
resentment
northcote
too
like
clarence
had
a
father
before
him
and
stood
on
quite
a
different
footing
from
the
ordinary
young
pastor
whose
business
it
was
to
be
humble
and
accept
all
that
his
betters
might
portion
out
well
he
said
you
can
afford
to
please
yourself
and
that
always
something
by
the
way
is
it
time
to
have
something
to
eat
if
there
is
a
good
hotel
near
luncheon
will
be
waiting
at
my
house
said
may
who
was
still
doing
his
best
to
please
the
man
upon
whom
he
had
built
such
wild
hopes
and
ursula
will
be
waiting
ah
ah
the
young
lady
so
she
will
i
would
miss
that
for
something
but
i
do
like
putting
you
to
so
much
expense
my
son
here
has
an
excellent
appetite
as
you
must
have
found
out
by
this
time
and
for
my
part
so
have
i
think
it
a
thousand
pities
to
put
you
to
this
trouble
and
expense
pray
do
think
of
that
said
may
with
courtesy
which
belied
his
feelings
for
he
would
have
liked
nothing
so
well
as
to
have
knocked
down
his
complacent
patron
he
led
the
way
out
almost
with
eagerness
feeling
copperhead
to
be
less
offensive
out
of
doors
than
within
four
walls
was
this
the
sort
of
man
to
be
appealed
to
for
help
as
he
had
thought
probably
his
very
arrogance
would
make
him
more
disposed
towards
liberality
probably
it
would
flatter
his
sense
of
consequence
to
have
such
a
request
made
to
him
may
was
very
much
at
sea
letting
i
dare
not
wait
upon
i
would
afraid
to
speak
lest
he
should
shut
this
door
of
help
by
so
doing
and
afraid
to
lose
the
chance
of
any
succour
by
not
speaking
he
tried
hard
in
spite
of
all
his
difficulties
to
be
smooth
and
agreeable
to
a
man
who
had
so
much
in
his
power
but
it
was
harder
work
than
he
could
have
thought
chapter
xxxvi
father
and
son
ursula
had
prepared
a
very
careful
luncheon
for
the
stranger
she
thought
him
disagreeable
but
she
had
not
looked
at
him
much
for
indeed
ursula
mind
was
much
unsettled
horace
northcote
had
spoken
to
her
that
morning
after
hurst
visit
and
her
retaliation
upon
him
as
no
man
yet
had
ever
spoken
to
her
before
he
had
told
her
a
long
story
though
it
was
briefly
done
and
could
have
been
expressed
in
three
words
he
was
not
of
her
species
of
humanity
his
ways
of
thinking
his
prejudices
his
traditions
were
all
different
from
hers
and
yet
that
had
happened
to
him
which
happens
all
over
the
world
in
every
kind
of
circumstances
without
knowing
how
it
was
he
had
got
to
love
her
yes
he
knew
very
well
how
it
was
or
rather
he
knew
when
it
was
which
is
all
that
is
to
be
expected
from
a
lover
it
was
on
the
evening
of
the
the
first
and
he
had
gone
on
ever
since
deeper
and
deeper
hearing
her
say
many
things
which
he
did
not
agree
in
and
tracing
her
life
through
a
score
of
little
habits
which
were
not
congenial
to
his
yet
loving
her
more
and
more
for
all
that
was
new
to
him
and
even
for
the
things
which
were
uncongenial
he
had
told
her
all
this
and
ursula
had
listened
with
a
kind
of
awe
wondering
at
the
ardour
in
the
young
man
eyes
and
the
warmth
with
which
he
spoke
wondering
and
trembling
a
little
she
had
guessed
what
he
meant
the
night
before
as
has
been
said
and
this
had
touched
her
with
a
little
thrill
of
awakened
feeling
but
the
innocent
girl
knew
no
more
about
passion
than
a
child
and
when
she
saw
it
glowing
and
ardent
appealing
to
her
she
was
by
the
strange
sight
what
answer
could
she
make
to
him
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
reject
him
altogether
was
not
in
ursula
heart
but
she
could
not
respond
to
that
strange
new
overwhelming
sentiment
which
put
a
light
in
his
eyes
which
she
dared
not
meet
which
dazzled
her
when
she
ventured
a
glance
at
him
was
he
to
go
away
he
asked
his
voice
too
sounding
musical
and
full
of
touching
chords
ursula
could
not
tell
him
to
go
away
either
what
she
did
say
to
him
she
never
quite
knew
but
at
least
whatever
it
was
it
left
him
hopeful
if
unsatisfied
and
since
that
time
her
mind
had
been
in
a
strange
confusion
a
confusion
strange
but
sweet
gratified
vanity
is
not
a
pretty
title
to
give
to
any
feeling
and
yet
that
mixture
of
gratification
and
gratitude
and
penetrating
pleasure
in
the
fact
of
being
elevated
from
an
and
imperfect
child
to
an
admired
and
worshipped
woman
is
perhaps
of
all
the
sensations
that
feminine
youth
is
conscious
of
the
most
poignant
in
its
sweetness
it
went
through
her
whole
life
sometimes
it
made
her
laugh
when
she
was
all
alone
and
there
was
nothing
of
a
nature
in
her
way
and
sometimes
it
made
her
cry
both
the
crying
and
the
laughter
being
one
it
was
strange
very
strange
and
yet
sweet
under
the
influence
of
this
and
of
the
secret
homage
which
northcote
paid
her
whenever
they
met
and
which
she
now
understood
as
she
had
never
understood
it
before
the
girl
whole
nature
expanded
though
she
did
not
know
she
was
becoming
sweet
to
the
children
to
puzzled
janey
to
every
one
around
her
her
little
petulances
were
all
subdued
she
was
more
sympathetic
than
she
had
ever
been
before
and
yet
she
was
not
in
love
with
her
lover
it
was
only
that
the
sunshine
of
young
life
had
caught
her
that
the
highest
gratification
of
youth
had
fallen
to
her
share
unawares
all
this
might
have
been
and
yet
some
one
else
come
in
to
secure
ursula
real
love
but
in
the
mean
time
she
was
all
the
happier
all
the
better
for
the
love
which
she
did
not
return
this
is
a
digression
from
our
immediate
subject
which
was
the
luncheon
prepared
for
copperhead
ursula
sent
up
an
urgent
message
for
phoebe
who
came
to
her
in
her
prettiest
morning
dress
very
carefully
arranged
but
with
a
line
of
care
upon
her
brow
i
will
come
if
you
wish
it
dear
she
said
but
i
do
want
to
meet
copperhead
i
do
like
him
neither
do
i
like
him
cried
ursula
he
said
something
disagreeable
the
little
moment
he
was
here
oh
i
do
remember
what
it
was
but
something
please
stay
what
am
i
to
do
with
them
all
by
myself
if
you
will
help
me
i
may
get
through
phoebe
kissed
her
with
a
tremulous
kiss
perhaps
she
was
not
unwilling
to
see
with
her
own
eyes
what
the
father
of
clarence
meant
and
what
brought
him
here
she
sat
down
at
the
window
and
was
the
first
to
see
them
coming
along
the
street
what
a
gentleman
your
father
looks
beside
them
cried
phoebe
both
of
them
father
and
son
though
clarence
after
all
is
a
great
deal
better
than
his
father
less
like
a
british
snob
ursula
came
and
stood
by
her
looking
out
i
do
think
he
is
much
better
than
his
father
she
said
phoebe
took
her
hand
suddenly
and
wrung
it
then
dropped
it
as
if
it
had
hurt
her
what
did
it
all
mean
ursula
though
rays
of
enlightenment
had
come
to
her
was
still
perplexed
and
did
not
understand
copperhead
did
not
see
her
till
he
went
to
luncheon
when
phoebe
appeared
with
little
amy
may
looking
like
a
visitor
newly
arrived
she
had
run
upstairs
after
that
first
sight
of
him
from
the
window
declaring
herself
unable
to
be
civil
to
him
except
at
table
the
great
man
face
almost
grew
pale
at
the
sight
of
her
he
looked
at
ursula
and
then
at
clarence
and
laughed
the
carcase
is
the
eagles
are
gathered
together
he
said
that
scripture
ai
it
miss
ursula
i
am
not
good
at
giving
chapter
and
verse
what
does
it
mean
asked
ursula
she
was
quite
indifferent
to
copperhead
and
perfectly
unconscious
of
his
observation
as
for
phoebe
on
the
contrary
she
was
slightly
agitated
her
placid
surface
ruffled
a
little
and
she
looked
her
best
in
her
agitation
copperhead
looked
straight
at
her
across
the
table
and
laughed
in
his
insolent
way
so
you
are
here
too
miss
phoebe
he
said
i
might
think
myself
in
the
crescent
if
i
did
know
better
i
met
young
northcote
just
now
and
now
you
what
may
you
be
doing
here
might
one
ask
it
is
what
you
call
a
curious
coincidence
ai
it
clarence
and
you
both
here
i
said
so
when
clarence
came
said
phoebe
came
to
take
care
of
my
grandmother
who
is
ill
and
it
was
a
very
lucky
thing
for
me
that
i
had
met
miss
may
at
your
ball
mr
copperhead
by
jove
was
it
said
clarence
roused
to
some
dull
sense
of
what
was
going
on
we
owe
all
the
fun
we
have
had
here
to
that
so
we
do
odd
when
one
thinks
of
it
and
thought
so
little
of
it
then
did
we
it
a
very
queer
world
so
you
been
having
fun
here
said
his
father
i
thought
you
came
here
to
work
that
how
we
old
fellows
get
taken
in
work
with
young
ladies
dangling
about
and
putting
things
into
your
head
i
ought
to
have
known
better
do
you
think
so
miss
ursula
could
have
taught
me
a
thing
or
two
i
said
ursula
startled
i
do
know
what
i
could
teach
any
one
i
think
clarence
copperhead
has
kept
to
his
hours
very
steadily
papa
is
rather
severe
he
never
would
take
any
excuse
from
any
of
us
when
we
were
working
with
him
he
is
not
so
severe
now
i
be
bound
said
copperhead
lets
you
have
your
fun
a
little
as
clarence
tells
me
do
you
may
girls
will
be
girls
and
boys
boys
whatever
we
do
and
i
am
sure
miss
phoebe
you
have
been
very
entertaining
as
you
always
were
i
have
done
my
best
said
phoebe
looking
him
in
the
face
i
should
have
had
a
dull
life
but
for
the
parsonage
and
i
have
tried
to
be
grateful
i
have
accompanied
your
son
on
the
violin
a
great
many
evenings
and
i
hope
our
friends
have
liked
it
clarence
is
a
promising
player
though
i
should
like
him
to
trust
less
to
his
ear
but
we
always
pulled
through
thanks
to
you
said
clarence
in
the
middle
of
his
cutlet
he
did
not
quite
see
why
she
should
flourish
this
music
in
his
face
but
still
he
was
loyal
in
a
dull
fashion
and
he
was
obstinate
and
did
not
mean
to
be
sat
upon
to
use
his
own
words
as
for
phoebe
her
quick
mind
caught
at
once
the
best
line
of
policy
she
determined
to
deliver
ursula
and
she
determined
at
the
same
time
to
let
her
future
if
he
was
to
be
her
see
what
sort
of
a
person
he
had
to
deal
with
as
soon
as
she
made
up
her
mind
her
agitation
disappeared
it
was
only
the
uncertainty
that
had
cowed
her
now
she
saw
what
to
do
so
said
copperhead
musical
evenings
i
hope
you
have
not
turned
poor
clar
head
among
you
young
ladies
it
not
a
very
strong
head
and
two
is
more
than
a
match
for
one
i
dare
say
he
has
had
no
chance
between
you
make
yourself
quite
easy
said
phoebe
with
her
sweetest
smile
he
was
only
one
of
a
party
reginald
may
and
northcote
are
both
very
pleasant
companions
your
son
is
bored
sometimes
but
the
rest
of
us
are
never
bored
you
see
he
has
been
accustomed
to
more
brilliant
society
but
as
for
us
we
have
no
particular
pretensions
we
have
been
very
happy
and
if
there
has
been
two
to
one
it
has
been
the
other
way
i
think
i
must
let
your
people
know
of
your
gaieties
miss
phoebe
if
your
mother
sent
you
here
i
do
doubt
it
was
for
a
purpose
eh
she
knows
what
she
about
and
she
wo
like
it
if
she
knows
you
are
fritting
away
your
chances
and
your
attentions
she
has
an
eye
for
business
has
beecham
said
the
leading
member
with
a
laugh
you
can
not
tell
mamma
more
about
me
than
she
knows
already
said
phoebe
with
rising
colour
and
by
this
time
every
one
else
at
table
was
uncomfortable
even
clarence
who
had
a
dull
appreciation
of
his
father
jokes
when
they
were
not
levelled
at
himself
and
who
was
by
no
means
indisposed
to
believe
that
girls
generally
were
after
him
and
that
even
in
this
particular
case
phoebe
herself
might
have
come
to
carlingford
on
purpose
to
complete
his
conquest
even
clarence
was
moved
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
brilliant
society
he
said
i
know
the
dull
one
among
you
clever
people
i
do
say
much
but
i
know
it
all
the
same
and
it
awfully
good
of
you
to
pull
me
through
all
that
music
i
do
begrudge
you
your
laugh
after
is
my
mother
coming
over
sir
to
see
the
place
to
see
what
there
is
not
much
in
the
place
said
copperhead
you
coming
back
with
me
my
boy
i
hope
it
wo
inconvenience
you
may
i
other
views
for
him
circumstances
alter
cases
you
know
been
turning
it
over
in
my
head
and
i
think
i
can
see
my
way
to
another
arrangement
that
of
course
is
entirely
in
your
own
hands
said
may
with
a
cheerfulness
he
did
not
feel
his
heart
sank
but
every
rule
of
good
society
made
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
show
no
failure
at
such
a
moment
copperhead
see
that
your
father
has
some
wine
well
i
suppose
our
poor
little
carlingford
is
not
much
of
a
place
no
trade
no
movement
no
manufactures
the
sort
of
place
that
should
be
cleared
off
the
face
of
the
earth
said
the
millionnaire
meaning
no
offence
of
course
that
my
opinion
in
respect
to
country
towns
what
the
good
of
them
nests
of
gossip
places
where
people
waste
their
time
and
do
even
amuse
themselves
give
me
green
fields
and
london
that
is
my
sort
i
do
care
if
there
was
not
another
blessed
brick
in
the
country
there
is
always
something
that
will
grow
in
a
field
corn
or
fat
beasts
not
that
we
could
get
all
that
cheaper
from
over
the
water
if
it
was
managed
as
it
ought
to
be
but
a
place
like
this
what
the
good
of
it
almshouses
and
chaplains
and
that
kind
of
rubbish
and
old
women
there
old
women
by
the
score
they
must
be
somewhere
i
suppose
said
may
we
can
not
kill
them
off
if
they
are
inoffensive
and
keep
the
laws
so
that
after
all
a
country
town
is
of
use
kill
off
no
it
against
what
you
benevolent
humbugs
call
the
spirit
of
the
time
and
christianity
and
all
that
but
there
such
a
thing
as
carrying
christianity
too
far
that
my
opinion
there
your
almshouses
now
what
the
principle
of
them
i
call
it
encouraging
those
old
beggars
to
live
said
copperhead
giving
them
permission
to
burden
the
community
as
long
as
they
can
manage
it
a
dead
mistake
depend
upon
it
the
greatest
mistake
in
the
world
i
think
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
in
favour
of
euthanasia
said
phoebe
quietly
stepping
into
the
conversation
but
then
it
would
have
to
be
with
the
consent
of
the
victims
when
any
one
found
himself
useless
unnecessary
to
the
world
or
unhappy
in
it
humbug
and
nonsense
said
copperhead
a
likely
thing
for
anybody
to
do
no
it
is
not
a
question
for
let
die
out
naturally
that
my
opinion
do
do
anything
to
hurry
that
is
i
do
see
my
way
to
it
but
let
go
quiet
and
do
bring
cordials
and
and
all
that
middyeval
nonsense
to
keep
going
as
long
as
possible
it
wicked
that
what
it
is
at
all
events
said
may
who
poor
man
was
bent
on
pleasing
it
is
refreshing
to
hear
opinions
so
bold
and
original
something
new
is
always
a
blessing
i
can
not
say
i
agree
with
you
no
parson
would
be
bold
enough
for
that
christianity
been
a
capital
thing
for
the
world
said
copperhead
i
do
say
a
word
against
it
but
in
these
days
sir
we
had
enough
of
it
that
to
say
when
it
carried
too
far
all
this
fuss
about
the
poor
all
the
row
about
dragging
up
a
lot
of
poor
little
beggars
to
live
that
had
far
better
die
and
your
almshouses
to
keep
the
old
ones
going
past
all
nature
shovel
the
mould
over
them
that
the
thing
for
the
world
let
die
when
they
ought
to
die
and
let
them
live
who
can
live
my
way
of
thinking
and
what
more
i
right
what
a
fine
thing
for
you
clarence
cried
phoebe
who
are
going
into
parliament
to
take
up
your
father
idea
and
work
it
out
what
a
speech
you
could
make
on
the
subject
i
saw
a
hospital
once
in
paris
that
would
make
such
a
wonderful
illustration
i
tell
you
about
it
if
you
like
poor
old
wretched
people
whose
life
was
nothing
but
wretchedness
kept
going
kept
living
for
years
and
years
why
no
one
could
tell
for
i
am
sure
it
would
have
been
better
far
better
for
them
to
die
and
be
done
with
it
what
a
speech
you
might
make
when
you
bring
a
bill
into
parliament
to
abolish
almshouses
and
all
sorts
of
charities
she
added
with
a
laugh
turning
from
clarence
at
whom
she
had
been
looking
to
his
father
who
was
puzzled
and
did
not
know
how
to
understand
the
young
woman
eyes
i
never
make
much
of
a
speech
in
parliament
said
clarence
unless
you
make
it
for
me
he
added
in
an
undertone
but
no
one
else
was
speaking
and
the
undertone
was
quite
audible
meanwhile
phoebe
had
not
ceased
to
look
at
his
father
and
held
him
with
a
pair
of
eyes
not
like
the
ancient
mariner
copperhead
was
confused
his
power
even
of
insolence
was
cowed
for
the
moment
he
obeyed
quite
docilely
the
movement
made
to
leave
the
table
was
it
possible
that
she
defied
him
this
minister
daughter
and
measured
her
strength
against
his
copperhead
felt
as
if
he
could
have
shaken
the
impertinent
girl
but
dared
not
being
where
he
was
and
lunch
being
over
may
led
his
pupil
father
into
his
study
i
want
to
show
you
what
your
boy
has
been
doing
he
said
pointing
to
a
line
of
books
which
made
the
millionnaire
soul
shrink
within
him
i
have
not
bothered
him
with
classics
what
was
the
use
as
he
is
not
going
back
to
oxford
but
i
have
done
my
best
for
him
in
a
practical
way
he
has
read
history
largely
as
you
see
and
as
much
as
i
could
give
him
of
political
and
constitutional
yes
yes
said
copperhead
reading
the
titles
of
some
of
the
books
under
his
breath
they
impressed
him
deeply
and
took
away
for
a
moment
his
it
was
his
habit
to
boast
that
he
knew
nothing
about
books
but
in
their
presence
he
shrank
feeling
that
they
were
greater
than
he
which
was
there
is
little
doubt
a
sign
of
grace
if
you
wish
to
remove
clarence
said
may
perhaps
i
had
better
make
out
a
scheme
of
reading
for
him
look
here
cried
the
rich
man
i
did
want
to
remove
him
but
there
he
is
the
first
i
see
of
him
cheek
for
jowl
with
a
girl
i
do
mean
to
say
a
word
against
miss
may
i
no
doubt
charming
but
anyhow
there
she
is
side
by
side
with
clar
who
is
no
more
able
to
resist
that
sort
of
thing
may
laughed
and
this
time
with
unmitigated
amusement
do
you
mean
ursula
i
think
i
can
answer
for
it
that
she
made
no
attempts
upon
him
for
which
resistance
would
be
necessary
that
all
very
well
to
say
but
bless
you
they
do
it
every
one
said
copperhead
without
exception
when
a
young
fellow
well
off
and
and
as
if
one
was
bad
enough
you
got
phoebe
beecham
you
wo
tell
me
she
does
mean
anything
up
to
any
mischief
a
real
minister
daughter
i
do
mean
anything
uncivil
to
you
or
yours
i
suppose
a
parson
different
but
we
know
what
a
minister
daughter
is
in
our
connection
like
the
men
themselves
in
short
who
are
always
pouncing
on
some
girl
with
a
fortune
if
her
relations
do
take
care
and
clarence
is
as
weak
as
a
baby
he
takes
after
his
mother
a
poor
bit
of
a
feeble
creature
though
he
like
me
in
exterior
that
how
it
is
you
perceive
i
do
quite
see
my
way
to
letting
him
go
on
that
is
of
course
precisely
as
you
please
said
may
somewhat
sharply
he
would
preserve
his
dignity
even
though
his
heart
was
sinking
but
he
could
not
keep
that
tone
of
sharpness
out
of
his
voice
of
course
it
is
as
i
please
i
pay
up
of
course
for
the
second
three
months
if
you
choose
fair
and
square
i
meant
him
to
stay
and
pay
but
that
all
you
no
further
claim
upon
me
that
i
know
of
and
i
must
say
that
for
a
tutor
a
regular
coach
to
keep
girls
in
his
house
daughters
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
them
is
something
monstrous
it
a
thing
no
fellow
friends
would
put
up
with
it
what
i
call
dishonourable
perhaps
said
may
with
all
the
he
was
master
of
you
will
let
your
son
know
at
once
that
he
must
pack
and
go
i
dare
say
sir
robert
can
take
him
and
we
will
send
the
portmanteaux
in
such
a
case
it
is
better
there
should
not
be
a
moment
delay
clarence
cried
copperhead
walking
to
the
door
and
opening
it
come
along
look
sharp
you
to
go
i
take
you
with
me
do
you
hear
and
may
will
see
to
sending
you
your
boxes
quick
come
along
there
no
time
to
lose
go
said
clarence
coming
in
startled
with
his
eyebrows
rising
almost
into
his
hair
go
what
do
you
mean
out
of
the
parsonage
the
governor
been
having
too
much
sherry
he
said
coming
close
to
may
arm
he
had
himself
been
taking
too
much
of
the
sherry
for
the
good
reason
that
nobody
had
taken
any
notice
of
what
he
did
and
that
he
had
foreseen
the
excitement
that
was
coming
you
do
mean
it
i
know
he
added
aloud
i
go
over
for
the
night
if
sir
robert
will
have
me
and
see
my
mother
ask
may
said
copperhead
you
believe
him
i
suppose
he
as
glad
to
get
rid
of
you
as
i
am
to
take
you
away
is
this
true
cried
clarence
roused
and
wondering
and
if
so
happened
i
ai
a
baby
you
know
to
be
bundled
about
from
one
to
another
the
governor
forgets
that
your
father
said
may
chooses
to
remove
you
and
that
is
all
i
choose
to
say
but
by
george
i
can
say
a
deal
more
said
copperhead
you
simpleton
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
leave
you
here
where
about
none
of
such
nonsense
for
me
put
your
things
together
i
tell
you
phoebe
beecham
bad
enough
at
home
but
if
she
thinks
to
have
you
here
to
pluck
at
her
leisure
she
and
her
friends
w
hew
said
clarence
with
a
long
whistle
so
that
it
i
am
very
sorry
father
if
these
are
your
sentiments
but
i
may
as
well
tell
you
at
once
i
sha
go
you
must
go
no
he
said
squaring
his
shoulders
and
putting
out
his
shirt
front
he
had
never
been
roused
into
rebellion
before
and
perhaps
without
these
extra
glasses
of
sherry
he
would
not
have
had
the
courage
now
but
what
with
sherry
and
what
with
and
what
with
the
thing
he
called
love
clarence
copperhead
mounted
all
at
once
upon
a
pedestal
he
had
a
certain
dogged
obstinacy
in
him
suspected
by
nobody
but
his
mother
who
had
little
enough
to
say
in
the
guidance
of
her
boy
he
set
himself
square
like
a
pugilist
which
was
his
notion
of
resistance
may
looked
on
with
a
curious
mixture
of
feelings
his
own
sudden
and
foolish
hope
was
over
and
what
did
it
matter
to
him
whether
the
detestable
father
or
the
coarse
son
should
win
he
turned
away
from
them
with
contempt
which
was
made
sharp
by
their
utter
uselessness
to
himself
had
it
been
possible
that
he
might
have
what
he
wanted
from
copperhead
his
patience
would
have
held
out
against
any
trial
but
the
moment
that
hope
was
over
what
further
interest
had
he
in
the
question
he
went
to
his
and
sat
down
there
leaving
them
to
fight
it
out
as
they
would
by
themselves
it
was
no
affair
of
his
chapter
xxxvii
a
pleasant
evening
the
result
however
was
a
compromise
clarence
copperhead
went
off
with
his
father
and
sir
robert
to
the
hall
for
the
night
but
was
to
return
next
day
and
phoebe
was
left
in
a
condition
of
some
excitement
behind
them
not
quite
knowing
what
to
think
she
was
as
sure
as
ever
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
propose
but
he
had
not
done
it
and
what
effect
his
father
visit
and
perhaps
his
mother
entreaties
might
have
upon
him
phoebe
could
not
tell
the
crisis
excited
her
beyond
any
excitement
which
she
would
have
thought
possible
in
respect
to
clarence
copperhead
she
was
more
like
an
applicant
for
office
kept
uncertain
whether
she
was
to
have
a
desirable
post
or
not
than
a
girl
on
the
eve
of
a
declaration
this
was
her
own
conception
of
the
circumstances
she
did
not
dislike
clarence
quite
the
reverse
she
had
no
sympathy
with
ursula
impatience
of
his
heavy
vanity
phoebe
had
been
used
to
him
all
her
life
and
had
never
thought
badly
of
the
heavy
boy
whom
she
had
been
invited
to
amuse
when
she
was
six
years
old
and
whom
she
had
no
particular
objection
to
amuse
still
let
the
others
wonder
at
her
as
they
might
poor
reginald
contemplating
bitterly
her
many
little
complacencies
to
his
rival
set
them
down
hastily
to
an
appreciation
of
that
rival
worldly
advantages
which
was
not
quite
a
just
sentence
it
was
true
and
yet
it
was
not
true
other
feelings
mingled
in
worldliness
she
did
indeed
perceive
and
esteem
highly
the
advantages
which
clarence
could
give
her
but
she
had
not
the
objections
to
clarence
himself
that
the
others
had
she
was
willing
quite
willing
to
undertake
the
charge
of
him
to
manage
and
guide
and
make
a
man
of
him
and
yet
while
it
was
not
pure
worldliness
much
less
was
it
actual
love
which
moved
her
it
was
a
kind
of
habitual
affection
as
for
the
poor
thing
but
mine
own
sir
of
the
jester
he
was
but
a
poor
creature
but
phoebe
knew
she
could
make
something
of
him
and
she
had
no
distaste
to
the
task
when
she
began
to
perceive
that
reginald
in
so
many
ways
clarence
superior
was
at
her
disposal
a
sense
of
gratification
went
through
phoebe
mind
and
it
certainly
occurred
to
her
that
the
feeling
he
might
inspire
would
be
a
warmer
and
a
more
delightful
one
than
that
which
would
fall
to
clarence
copperhead
but
she
was
not
tempted
thereby
to
throw
clarence
off
for
the
other
no
she
was
pleased
and
not
unwilling
to
expend
a
little
tender
regret
and
gratitude
upon
poor
reginald
she
was
ready
to
be
kind
to
him
though
every
woman
knows
that
is
the
last
thing
she
ought
to
be
to
a
rejected
lover
and
she
was
full
of
sympathy
for
the
disappointment
which
nevertheless
she
fully
intended
was
to
be
his
lot
this
seems
paradoxical
but
it
is
no
more
paradoxical
than
human
creatures
generally
are
on
this
particular
evening
her
heart
beat
very
high
on
account
of
clarence
to
know
if
he
would
have
strength
of
mind
to
hold
his
own
against
his
father
and
if
he
would
come
back
to
her
and
ask
her
as
she
felt
certain
he
meant
to
do
that
one
momentous
question
her
heart
would
not
have
been
broken
had
he
not
done
so
but
still
she
would
have
been
disappointed
notwithstanding
when
the
evening
came
the
absence
of
clarence
was
a
relief
to
phoebe
as
well
as
to
the
rest
of
the
party
and
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
pleasures
of
a
few
hours
of
intercourse
with
reginald
with
a
sense
of
enjoyment
such
as
she
seldom
felt
this
was
very
wrong
there
is
no
denying
it
but
still
so
it
was
she
was
anxious
that
clarence
should
come
back
to
her
and
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
and
yet
she
was
pleased
to
be
rid
of
clarence
and
to
give
her
whole
attention
and
sympathy
to
reginald
trying
her
best
to
please
him
it
was
very
wrong
and
yet
such
things
have
happened
before
and
will
again
and
are
as
natural
perhaps
as
the
more
absolute
and
unwavering
passion
which
has
no
doubt
of
its
object
passion
like
northcote
who
had
neither
eyes
nor
ears
for
anything
but
ursula
the
four
were
alone
together
that
evening
and
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
clarence
was
away
who
to
all
but
phoebe
was
an
interruption
of
their
intercourse
and
may
was
away
in
his
study
too
much
absorbed
to
think
of
any
duties
that
ought
to
have
devolved
upon
him
as
chaperon
and
even
janey
was
out
of
the
way
taking
tea
with
hurst
so
the
two
young
pairs
sat
round
the
table
and
talked
the
girls
with
a
mutual
panic
which
neither
breathed
to
the
other
keeping
together
avoiding
separation
into
pairs
ursula
out
of
very
shyness
and
fright
alone
lest
another
chapter
of
the
strange
novel
too
moving
might
be
poured
into
her
ears
but
phoebe
with
more
settled
purpose
to
prevent
any
disclosure
on
the
part
of
reginald
the
evening
was
mixed
up
of
pleasure
and
pain
to
the
two
young
men
each
eager
to
find
himself
alone
with
the
girl
whom
he
loved
but
it
is
to
be
feared
the
girls
themselves
had
a
furtive
guilty
enjoyment
of
it
which
they
ought
not
to
have
had
open
and
outrageous
is
not
half
so
delicate
a
pastime
as
that
in
which
nothing
distinct
dare
be
said
but
all
is
implication
conveyed
and
understood
without
words
i
know
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
confess
but
veracity
requires
the
confession
you
may
say
it
was
the
playing
of
the
cat
with
the
mouse
if
you
wish
to
give
a
disagreeable
version
of
it
but
however
you
choose
to
explain
it
this
was
how
it
was
it
was
with
fear
and
trembling
at
last
that
phoebe
went
to
the
piano
which
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
after
making
all
the
resistance
which
was
possible
thank
heaven
that
idiot
and
his
fiddle
are
here
to
interfere
cried
reginald
phoebe
shook
her
head
at
him
but
ventured
on
no
words
and
how
she
did
exert
herself
on
the
piano
playing
things
which
were
a
great
deal
too
classical
for
reginald
who
would
have
preferred
the
simplest
stock
piece
under
cover
of
which
he
might
have
talked
to
her
hanging
over
her
chair
and
making
belief
to
turn
over
the
music
this
was
what
he
wanted
poor
fellow
he
had
no
heart
nor
ears
for
beethoven
which
phoebe
played
to
him
with
a
tremor
in
her
heart
and
yet
the
wicked
little
witch
with
some
enjoyment
too
this
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
you
play
when
copperhead
is
here
he
said
at
last
driven
to
resistance
oh
we
play
mendelssohn
said
phoebe
with
much
show
of
innocence
and
then
she
added
you
ought
to
feel
the
compliment
if
i
play
beethoven
to
you
so
i
ought
i
suppose
said
reginald
the
truth
is
i
do
care
for
music
do
take
your
hands
off
the
keys
why
you
have
done
nothing
but
worry
me
to
play
not
for
the
music
said
reginald
quite
satisfied
to
have
got
his
will
why
will
you
not
talk
to
me
and
play
to
me
as
i
wish
perhaps
if
i
knew
what
you
wish
phoebe
said
in
spite
of
herself
oh
how
i
should
like
to
tell
you
no
not
beethoven
a
little
just
a
little
music
heavens
cried
reginald
as
she
crashed
into
a
fortissimo
another
sonata
listen
i
am
not
equal
to
sonatas
nay
miss
beecham
play
me
a
little
nothing
talk
to
me
she
shook
her
head
at
him
with
a
laugh
and
went
on
playing
the
hardest
piece
of
music
she
could
think
of
complicating
herself
in
difficult
chords
and
sudden
accidentals
if
there
had
been
anybody
there
to
hear
who
could
have
understood
phoebe
performance
would
no
doubt
have
appeared
a
masterpiece
of
brilliant
execution
as
it
was
but
the
two
others
were
paying
not
the
slightest
attention
and
as
for
reginald
he
was
in
a
state
of
tantalized
vexation
which
himself
and
filled
the
performer
with
an
exhilarating
sense
of
successful
mischief
northcote
was
trying
to
say
what
was
he
not
trying
to
say
to
ursula
under
cover
of
the
music
which
was
the
best
shield
he
could
have
had
and
perhaps
in
reality
though
reginald
was
tantalized
to
the
utmost
degree
of
tantalization
even
he
had
a
certain
enjoyment
in
the
saucy
which
was
more
mischievous
than
cruel
he
stood
behind
phoebe
chair
now
and
then
meeting
her
laughing
glance
with
one
of
tender
appeal
and
reproach
pleased
to
feel
himself
thus
isolated
with
her
and
held
an
in
so
genial
a
way
he
would
have
his
opportunity
after
a
while
when
there
would
be
no
piano
to
give
her
a
momentary
refuge
and
then
he
would
say
out
all
that
was
in
his
heart
with
no
possible
shadow
of
a
rival
to
interfere
with
him
angry
no
as
he
stood
behind
her
watching
her
fingers
fly
over
the
keys
a
delightful
calm
stole
over
reginald
now
and
then
she
would
throw
a
glance
at
him
upward
over
her
shoulder
as
she
swept
over
the
resounding
board
when
the
sonata
was
concluded
phoebe
sprang
up
from
the
piano
and
went
back
to
the
table
she
proposed
that
they
should
play
a
game
at
cards
to
which
ursula
agreed
the
young
men
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
protested
but
after
all
what
did
it
matter
so
long
as
they
were
together
they
fell
into
their
places
quite
naturally
the
very
cards
assisting
and
so
the
moments
flew
by
there
was
not
so
much
sound
as
usual
in
the
old
faded
which
had
come
to
look
so
bright
and
homelike
not
so
much
sound
of
voices
perhaps
less
laughter
yet
of
all
the
evenings
they
had
spent
there
together
that
was
the
one
they
looked
back
upon
all
four
with
most
tender
recollection
they
had
been
so
happy
or
if
not
happy
so
near
apparently
to
happiness
which
is
better
sometimes
than
happiness
itself
do
let
reginald
come
with
me
phoebe
whispered
as
she
kissed
her
friend
and
said
good
night
or
ask
northcote
to
come
too
why
said
ursula
with
dreamy
eyes
her
own
young
tide
of
life
was
rising
invading
for
the
moment
her
perceptions
and
dulling
her
sense
of
what
was
going
on
round
her
there
was
no
time
however
for
anything
more
to
be
said
for
reginald
was
close
behind
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
phoebe
had
to
resign
herself
and
she
knew
what
was
coming
the
only
thing
was
if
possible
to
stop
the
declaration
on
the
way
this
is
the
first
chance
i
have
had
of
seeing
you
home
without
that
perpetual
shadow
of
copperhead
ah
poor
clarence
said
phoebe
i
wonder
how
he
is
getting
on
away
from
us
all
poor
clarence
echoed
reginald
aghast
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
miss
him
miss
beecham
i
never
heard
you
speak
of
him
in
that
tone
before
miss
him
no
perhaps
not
exactly
said
phoebe
with
a
soft
little
sigh
but
still
i
have
known
him
all
my
life
may
when
we
were
quite
little
i
used
to
be
sent
for
to
his
grand
nursery
full
of
lovely
toys
and
things
a
great
deal
grander
than
mine
and
for
that
reason
said
reginald
becoming
bitter
with
a
laugh
nothing
for
that
reason
said
phoebe
but
i
noticed
it
at
six
as
i
should
at
twenty
i
must
have
been
a
horrid
little
thing
do
you
think
so
you
see
there
are
the
associations
of
a
great
many
years
to
make
me
say
poor
clarence
when
anything
is
the
matter
with
him
he
is
lucky
to
rouse
your
sympathies
so
warmly
cried
reginald
thoroughly
wretched
but
i
did
not
know
there
was
anything
the
matter
i
think
there
will
be
if
he
has
to
leave
our
little
society
where
we
have
all
been
so
happy
said
phoebe
softly
how
little
one
thought
coming
here
a
stranger
how
pleasant
it
was
to
be
i
especially
to
whom
coming
to
carlingford
was
rather
perhaps
i
might
say
a
humiliation
i
am
very
fond
of
grandpapa
and
grandmamma
now
but
the
first
introduction
was
something
of
a
shock
i
have
never
denied
it
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
sweet
kind
ursula
and
you
all
the
little
breathless
fragmentary
pause
which
phoebe
made
between
the
you
and
the
all
giving
just
a
ghost
of
emphasis
to
the
pronoun
sounded
to
poor
reginald
in
his
foolishness
almost
like
a
caress
how
cleverly
it
was
managed
with
just
so
much
natural
feeling
in
it
as
gave
it
reality
they
were
approaching
no
and
martha
the
maid
already
was
visible
at
the
open
door
then
you
do
give
me
some
share
some
little
share
he
cried
with
a
broken
voice
ah
if
you
would
only
let
me
tell
you
what
your
coming
has
been
to
me
it
has
opened
up
my
life
i
feel
everything
different
the
old
earth
itself
there
is
a
new
light
upon
the
whole
world
hush
here
is
martha
cried
phoebe
she
will
not
understand
about
new
lights
yes
it
has
been
pleasant
very
pleasant
when
one
begins
to
sigh
and
realize
how
pleasant
a
thing
has
been
i
always
fear
it
is
going
to
be
broken
up
omen
cried
reginald
fervently
taking
the
hand
she
had
put
out
to
bid
him
good
night
and
holding
it
fast
to
detain
her
and
was
there
moisture
in
the
eyes
which
she
lifted
to
him
and
which
glistened
he
thought
though
there
was
only
the
distant
light
of
a
lamp
to
see
them
by
you
must
not
keep
me
now
cried
phoebe
here
is
grandpapa
coming
good
night
may
good
night
was
phoebe
a
mere
coquette
et
as
soon
as
she
had
got
safe
within
these
walls
she
stooped
down
over
the
primroses
to
get
rid
of
martha
and
then
in
the
darkness
had
a
cry
all
by
herself
on
one
side
of
the
wall
while
the
young
lover
with
his
head
full
of
her
checked
but
not
altogether
discouraged
went
slowly
away
on
the
other
she
cried
and
her
heart
contracted
with
a
real
pang
he
was
very
tender
in
his
reverential
homage
very
romantic
a
true
lover
not
the
kind
of
man
who
wants
a
wife
or
wants
a
clever
companion
to
amuse
him
and
save
him
the
expense
of
a
coach
and
be
his
to
refer
to
in
everything
that
was
an
altogether
different
kind
of
thing
phoebe
went
in
with
a
sense
in
her
mind
that
perhaps
she
had
never
touched
so
close
upon
a
higher
kind
of
existence
and
perhaps
never
again
might
have
the
opportunity
but
before
she
had
crossed
the
garden
she
had
begun
once
more
to
question
whether
clarence
would
have
the
fortitude
to
hold
his
own
against
everything
that
father
or
mother
could
do
to
change
his
mind
would
he
have
the
fortitude
would
he
come
back
to
her
safe
and
determined
or
would
he
yield
to
arguments
in
favour
of
some
richer
bride
and
come
back
either
estranged
or
at
the
least
doubtful
this
gave
her
a
pang
of
profound
anxiety
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
chapter
xxxviii
an
expedition
may
did
not
come
upstairs
that
evening
it
was
not
that
he
was
paralysed
as
he
had
been
on
the
previous
occasion
when
he
sat
as
now
and
heard
phoebe
go
away
after
her
first
visit
and
when
the
wind
blowing
in
from
the
open
door
playfully
carried
to
his
feet
the
scribbled
note
with
tozer
name
he
was
not
stupefied
as
then
nor
was
he
miserable
the
threatened
withdrawal
of
clarence
copperhead
was
more
to
him
than
the
impending
ruin
meant
by
that
bill
which
was
so
nearly
due
he
was
occupied
by
that
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other
it
would
be
a
most
serious
change
to
him
in
every
way
he
had
calculated
on
the
continuance
of
this
additional
income
for
at
least
a
year
and
short
of
the
year
it
would
have
done
him
no
good
but
had
simply
plunged
him
into
additional
expense
it
was
this
he
was
thinking
of
and
which
kept
him
in
his
study
after
the
young
people
had
assembled
cotsdean
had
come
again
while
may
was
at
dinner
which
by
some
curious
unconscious
aggravation
on
his
part
was
the
time
he
especially
chose
as
most
convenient
for
him
and
he
had
again
sent
a
dirty
note
by
bobby
imploring
his
principal
to
think
of
the
impending
fate
and
not
to
desert
him
may
was
angry
at
this
perpetual
appeal
why
should
i
desert
him
the
idiot
he
said
to
himself
and
moved
by
the
man
persistence
he
took
out
his
again
and
made
out
beyond
all
chance
of
mistake
that
it
was
the
why
should
the
fool
insist
upon
its
being
the
with
such
perpetual
iteration
there
were
the
figures
as
plain
as
possible
april
may
wrote
a
peremptory
note
announcing
this
fact
to
cotsdean
and
then
returned
to
his
own
thoughts
sir
robert
had
asked
him
to
go
over
that
morning
and
spend
the
day
at
the
hall
with
the
copperheads
not
knowing
of
any
breach
between
them
he
thought
he
had
better
do
this
if
clarence
determined
to
stay
that
would
be
a
great
thing
in
his
favour
and
he
had
seen
that
the
young
man
dull
spirit
was
roused
and
if
that
hope
failed
there
might
still
be
advantage
even
in
this
sudden
breaking
of
the
bond
part
of
the
second
quarter
was
gone
and
the
father
had
offered
three
months
additional
pay
these
two
payments
would
make
up
the
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
at
once
and
settle
the
business
thus
in
either
way
he
should
be
safe
for
if
clarence
went
away
the
money
would
be
paid
and
if
he
stayed
may
himself
had
made
up
his
mind
to
risk
the
bold
step
of
going
to
the
bank
and
asking
an
advance
on
this
inalienable
security
all
these
deliberations
made
his
mind
easy
about
the
bill
it
must
come
right
one
way
or
another
he
might
have
chosen
perhaps
not
to
run
it
quite
so
close
but
after
all
the
was
only
and
there
were
still
three
days
while
his
mind
was
full
of
these
things
he
did
not
care
to
go
upstairs
he
heard
the
voices
of
the
young
people
but
he
was
too
much
engrossed
with
his
own
calculations
to
care
to
join
them
it
was
a
close
thing
he
said
to
himself
a
very
close
thing
but
still
he
felt
that
he
could
do
it
surely
he
could
do
it
if
copperhead
settled
with
him
and
he
was
the
sort
of
man
a
man
to
whom
money
was
nothing
to
do
so
on
the
spot
if
he
took
it
into
his
head
then
all
was
right
and
if
copperhead
did
not
do
so
the
bank
though
his
past
transactions
with
it
had
not
been
encouraging
would
certainly
make
all
right
on
account
of
these
copperhead
payments
which
were
as
certain
as
any
payments
could
be
he
went
to
bed
early
being
engrossed
by
these
thoughts
not
even
saying
to
ursula
as
was
his
wont
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
take
an
early
breakfast
and
start
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
for
the
hall
there
was
an
early
train
which
would
suit
admirably
he
could
not
afford
to
drive
as
sir
robert
had
done
changing
horses
half
way
he
went
upstairs
to
bed
somewhat
heavily
but
not
discontented
seeing
his
way
after
all
the
great
thing
in
life
is
to
see
your
way
it
does
not
matter
so
much
whether
that
way
is
great
or
small
so
long
as
you
can
see
it
plain
before
you
may
breathed
a
sigh
of
anxiety
as
he
ended
the
day
he
had
a
great
many
things
on
his
mind
but
still
he
was
not
altogether
or
discouraged
beyond
measure
things
he
felt
would
shape
themselves
better
than
he
had
hoped
he
was
not
perhaps
going
to
be
so
much
better
off
than
of
old
as
he
thought
possible
when
clarence
copperhead
came
such
delusive
prospects
do
glimmer
across
a
poor
path
when
any
apparent
expansion
of
means
occurs
to
him
but
in
the
majority
of
cases
he
has
to
consent
to
see
the
fine
fictitious
glow
die
away
may
was
not
ignorant
of
this
experience
already
a
man
who
is
over
fifty
is
generally
more
or
less
prepared
for
anything
that
can
happen
to
him
in
this
kind
but
he
thought
he
could
get
on
and
after
all
that
is
the
sum
of
life
to
three
parts
of
mankind
he
was
silent
at
breakfast
but
not
disagreeable
and
ursula
was
too
much
taken
up
with
her
own
concerns
to
pay
much
attention
to
him
ursula
concerns
were
developing
with
a
rapidity
altogether
extraordinary
in
the
mind
of
a
girl
of
twenty
unforestalled
by
any
previous
experience
the
process
that
goes
on
between
the
moment
when
the
surprising
overwhelming
discovery
rushes
upon
her
that
some
one
loves
her
in
the
old
way
of
romance
until
the
corresponding
moment
when
she
finds
out
that
her
own
heart
too
has
been
invaded
by
this
wonderful
sentiment
which
is
like
nothing
that
was
ever
known
before
is
of
a
very
rapid
description
it
is
like
the
bursting
of
a
flower
which
a
day
sunshine
brings
to
the
blooming
point
like
a
miracle
though
it
is
in
reality
the
simplest
result
of
nature
already
there
began
to
glow
a
haze
of
brightness
about
those
three
months
past
in
which
everything
had
begun
when
or
how
it
began
she
could
not
now
tell
the
glow
of
it
was
in
her
eyes
and
dazzled
her
she
heard
the
voices
of
the
others
sounding
vaguely
through
this
bright
mist
in
which
she
herself
was
isolated
when
she
was
obliged
to
reply
she
called
herself
back
with
an
effort
and
did
so
but
of
her
own
will
she
seldom
spoke
how
janey
chattered
how
the
children
maundered
on
about
their
little
concerns
which
were
of
consequence
to
nobody
papa
was
the
person
whom
ursula
really
respected
this
morning
for
he
had
more
sense
than
to
talk
how
could
people
talk
as
if
there
was
pleasure
in
that
but
papa
had
more
sense
he
had
things
to
think
of
too
so
the
girl
approved
her
father
and
thought
more
highly
of
him
and
never
inquired
what
it
might
be
that
occupied
his
mind
and
kept
him
from
noticing
even
when
the
children
were
unruly
and
it
would
be
giving
the
reader
an
unfair
idea
of
the
children
if
we
attempted
to
conceal
that
they
did
take
advantage
of
their
opportunities
and
were
as
unruly
as
children
in
the
circumstances
were
likely
to
be
may
took
no
notice
he
took
his
coffee
hurriedly
and
went
off
to
the
station
if
i
do
return
this
evening
you
need
not
be
alarmed
i
shall
come
back
at
the
latest
morning
he
said
the
children
all
rushed
to
the
window
to
see
him
go
away
even
ursula
looking
out
dreamily
remarked
him
too
as
she
seldom
did
and
sam
hurst
at
her
window
wondering
where
her
neighbour
could
be
going
heaved
a
deep
sigh
of
admiration
which
though
she
was
not
in
love
as
the
girls
thought
with
may
was
a
passing
tribute
to
his
good
looks
and
training
he
looked
a
gentleman
every
inch
of
him
an
english
gentleman
spotless
in
linen
speckless
in
broadcloth
though
his
dress
was
far
from
new
the
freshness
of
sound
health
and
a
clear
conscience
on
his
handsome
face
though
he
was
no
longer
young
his
abundant
hair
slightly
crisped
under
his
hat
not
curling
exactly
but
with
a
becoming
twist
in
it
clerical
yet
not
too
clerical
a
man
given
to
no
extremes
decorously
churchmanlike
yet
liberal
and
tolerant
of
the
world
though
she
was
too
wise
to
compromise
her
own
comfort
by
marrying
him
hurst
felt
that
there
was
a
great
pleasure
in
making
his
daughters
anxious
about
her
intentions
and
that
even
to
be
said
to
be
in
love
with
such
a
man
was
no
shame
but
rather
the
reverse
he
went
away
accordingly
taking
a
short
cut
to
the
railway
and
thus
missing
cotsdean
who
came
breathless
ten
minutes
after
he
was
gone
and
followed
him
to
the
train
but
too
late
well
well
cotsdean
said
to
himself
wiping
his
forehead
old
tozer
has
plenty
it
ai
nothing
to
him
to
pay
they
can
settle
it
between
cotsdean
himself
was
easier
in
his
mind
than
he
had
ever
been
before
on
such
an
occasion
his
clergyman
though
personally
an
awful
and
personage
was
so
far
as
money
went
a
man
of
straw
as
he
well
knew
and
his
name
on
a
bill
was
very
little
worth
but
tozer
was
a
man
who
could
pay
his
way
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
or
even
ten
times
that
would
not
ruin
the
old
shopkeeper
cotsdean
sense
of
commercial
honour
was
not
so
very
keen
that
the
dishonouring
of
his
bill
in
the
circumstances
should
give
him
a
very
serious
pang
he
would
not
be
sold
up
or
have
an
execution
put
into
his
shop
when
the
other
party
to
the
bill
was
so
substantial
a
person
of
course
tozer
when
he
signed
it
must
have
been
told
all
about
it
and
cotsdean
did
not
see
how
with
two
such
allies
against
ruin
anything
very
serious
could
befall
him
he
was
uneasy
indeed
but
his
uneasiness
had
no
such
force
in
it
as
before
he
went
back
to
his
shop
and
his
business
prepared
to
take
the
matter
as
calmly
as
possible
he
was
but
passive
in
it
it
could
not
harm
him
much
in
the
eyes
of
his
banker
who
knew
his
affairs
too
well
to
be
much
astonished
at
any
such
incident
and
tozer
and
may
must
settle
it
between
them
it
was
their
affair
meanwhile
may
rattled
along
in
the
railway
towards
the
hall
he
got
a
at
the
little
inn
at
the
station
to
take
him
over
though
generally
when
he
went
to
see
the
dorsets
it
was
his
custom
to
walk
but
what
were
a
few
shillings
he
said
to
himself
the
prodigality
of
desperation
having
seized
upon
him
in
any
case
he
could
pay
that
and
if
he
was
to
be
ruined
what
did
a
few
shillings
more
or
less
matter
but
the
discomfort
of
walking
over
those
muddy
roads
and
arriving
with
dirty
boots
and
a
aspect
mattered
a
great
deal
he
reached
the
hall
at
a
propitious
moment
when
copperhead
was
in
the
highest
he
had
been
taken
over
the
place
from
one
end
to
another
over
the
stables
the
the
farm
itself
from
end
to
end
the
preserves
the
shrubberies
the
greenhouses
everything
all
of
which
details
he
examined
with
an
unfailing
curiosity
which
would
have
been
highly
flattering
to
the
possessors
if
it
had
not
been
neutralized
by
a
strain
of
comment
which
was
much
less
satisfactory
when
may
went
in
he
found
him
in
the
with
sir
robert
and
his
daughters
standing
by
clapping
his
wings
and
crowing
loudly
over
a
picture
which
the
dorsets
prized
much
it
represented
a
bit
of
vague
italian
scenery
mellow
and
tranquil
and
was
a
true
wilson
bought
by
an
uncle
of
sir
robert
who
had
been
a
connoisseur
from
the
master
himself
in
the
very
country
where
it
was
painted
and
all
these
details
pleased
the
imagination
of
the
family
who
though
probably
they
would
have
been
but
mildly
delighted
had
they
possessed
the
acquaintance
of
the
best
of
contemporary
painters
were
proud
that
uncle
charles
had
known
italian
wilson
and
had
bought
a
picture
out
of
his
studio
a
hobbema
or
a
poussin
would
scarcely
have
pleased
them
as
much
for
the
worst
of
an
old
master
is
that
your
friends
look
suspiciously
upon
it
as
a
copy
whereas
wilson
is
scarcely
old
enough
or
precious
enough
to
be
copied
they
were
showing
their
picture
and
telling
the
story
to
the
millionnaire
with
an
agreeable
sense
that
though
they
were
not
so
rich
they
must
at
least
have
the
advantage
of
him
in
this
way
ha
said
copperhead
you
should
see
my
turner
did
i
show
you
my
turner
i
do
venture
to
tell
you
sir
robert
what
that
picture
cost
me
it
a
sin
it
is
to
keep
that
amount
of
capital
hanging
useless
upon
a
bit
of
wall
the
wilson
may
be
all
very
well
i
ai
a
judge
of
art
and
i
ca
give
my
opinion
on
that
point
though
it
a
common
sort
of
a
name
and
there
do
seem
to
be
much
in
it
but
everybody
knows
what
a
turner
means
here
may
he
be
able
to
tell
you
as
well
as
another
it
means
a
few
cool
thousands
take
my
word
for
it
it
means
i
believe
that
heaps
of
people
would
give
you
your
own
price
i
do
call
it
a
profitable
investment
for
it
brings
in
no
interest
but
they
tell
me
it
a
thing
that
grows
in
value
every
year
and
there
it
is
sir
hanging
up
useless
on
my
wall
in
portland
place
costing
a
fortune
and
bringing
in
not
a
penny
but
i
like
it
i
like
it
for
i
can
afford
it
by
george
here
may
he
knows
what
that
sort
of
thing
is
he
tell
you
that
a
turner
is
worth
its
weight
in
gold
thank
you
i
do
think
i
need
any
information
on
that
subject
said
sir
robert
besides
i
saw
your
turner
it
is
a
pretty
picture
if
it
is
authentic
but
wilson
you
know
was
a
swell
not
to
be
authentic
eh
said
copperhead
common
name
enough
and
i
do
know
that
i
ever
heard
of
him
in
the
way
of
painting
but
i
do
pretend
to
be
a
judge
may
now
i
dare
say
he
knows
all
about
it
buying
one
thing
knowing
another
your
knowing
ones
when
they
got
any
money
they
have
the
advantage
over
us
sir
robert
they
can
pick
up
a
thing
good
when
it
happens
to
come
their
way
dirt
cheap
but
fortunately
for
us
it
is
often
they
got
any
money
he
added
with
a
laugh
slapping
may
on
the
shoulder
in
a
way
which
made
him
totter
but
the
clergyman
was
equal
even
to
this
assault
it
is
wonderful
how
patient
and
tolerant
we
can
all
be
when
the
motive
is
strong
enough
that
is
true
he
said
but
i
fear
i
have
not
even
the
compensation
of
knowledge
i
know
enough
however
to
feel
that
the
possessor
of
a
turner
is
a
public
personage
and
may
be
a
public
benefactor
if
he
pleases
how
that
if
you
think
i
am
one
to
go
lending
my
pictures
about
or
leaving
them
to
the
nation
when
i
done
for
that
not
my
sort
no
i
keep
them
to
myself
if
i
consent
to
have
all
that
money
useless
it
is
for
myself
you
may
depend
and
not
for
other
people
and
i
leave
it
to
my
boy
clarence
if
he
behaves
himself
he
a
curiosity
too
and
has
a
deal
of
money
laid
out
on
him
that
brings
no
interest
him
and
his
mother
i
leave
it
to
clar
if
he
does
make
a
low
marriage
or
any
folly
of
that
kind
you
should
make
it
an
said
sir
robert
with
sarcasm
too
fine
for
his
antagonist
leave
it
from
father
to
son
of
your
descendants
like
our
family
diamonds
and
plate
anne
and
sophy
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
the
one
sadly
the
other
satirically
the
dorset
family
jewels
were
of
small
value
and
the
plate
was
but
moderate
in
quantity
and
not
very
great
in
quality
poor
sir
robert
liked
to
blow
his
little
trumpet
too
but
it
was
not
so
blatant
as
that
of
his
visitor
whose
rude
senses
did
not
even
see
the
intended
malice
by
george
i
think
i
will
he
said
i
told
it
as
safe
as
the
bank
and
worth
more
and
more
every
year
and
if
it
do
bring
in
anything
it
do
eat
anything
eh
may
look
here
perhaps
i
was
hasty
the
other
day
he
said
pushing
the
clergyman
a
little
apart
from
the
group
with
a
large
hand
on
his
shoulder
clarence
tells
me
the
best
coach
he
ever
saw
and
that
he
getting
on
like
a
house
on
fire
he
does
make
progress
i
think
answered
the
tutor
thus
gracefully
complimented
but
all
the
same
you
know
i
had
a
right
to
be
annoyed
now
a
man
of
your
sense
for
you
seem
a
man
of
sense
though
you
a
parson
and
know
what
side
your
bread
buttered
on
ought
to
see
that
it
an
aggravating
thing
when
a
young
fellow
has
been
sent
to
a
coach
for
his
instruction
and
to
keep
him
out
of
harm
way
to
find
him
cheek
by
jowl
with
a
young
woman
that
not
what
a
father
has
a
right
to
expect
you
could
expect
me
to
do
away
with
my
daughter
because
i
happened
to
take
a
pupil
said
may
but
i
can
assure
you
that
she
has
no
designs
upon
your
son
so
i
hear
so
i
hear
said
the
other
with
a
mixture
of
pique
and
satisfaction
wo
look
at
him
clar
tells
me
got
her
eye
on
some
one
else
little
fool
she
never
have
such
a
chance
again
as
for
having
no
designs
that
bosh
you
know
all
women
have
designs
i
a
deal
easier
in
my
mind
when
i
told
she
got
other
fish
to
fry
other
fish
to
fry
said
may
this
time
he
was
wholly
amused
and
laughed
this
is
news
to
me
however
we
do
want
to
discuss
my
little
ursula
about
your
son
it
will
be
well
that
i
should
know
for
i
might
be
forming
other
engagements
this
moment
is
a
time
of
pecuniary
pressure
with
me
he
added
with
the
ingratiating
smile
and
frankness
of
the
borrower
i
have
not
taken
pupils
before
but
i
want
money
for
the
time
my
son
settlement
in
life
you
see
and
but
the
father
of
a
large
family
can
always
find
good
reasons
for
wanting
money
that
it
said
copperhead
seriously
why
are
you
the
father
of
a
large
family
that
what
i
ask
our
ministers
it
against
all
political
economy
that
is
according
as
you
no
money
to
give
you
go
and
have
children
when
it
should
be
just
the
other
way
that
may
be
very
true
but
there
they
are
and
ca
be
done
away
with
and
i
do
want
money
as
it
happens
more
now
than
i
shall
want
it
a
year
hence
or
perhaps
even
six
months
hence
most
people
do
said
copperhead
withdrawing
his
hand
from
his
pocket
and
placing
his
elbow
tightly
against
the
orifice
of
that
very
important
part
of
him
it
the
commonest
thing
in
the
world
i
want
money
myself
for
that
matter
i
always
got
a
large
amount
to
make
up
by
a
certain
date
and
a
bill
to
pay
but
about
clar
that
the
important
matter
as
he
seems
to
have
set
his
mind
on
it
and
as
you
assure
me
there
no
danger
or
that
sort
of
thing
eh
the
colour
came
to
may
cheek
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
to
have
his
own
daughter
spoken
of
as
a
gave
him
a
momentary
thrill
of
anger
but
as
he
would
have
applied
the
word
quite
composedly
to
any
other
man
daughter
the
resentment
was
evanescent
he
did
not
trust
himself
to
answer
however
but
nodded
somewhat
impatiently
which
made
the
millionnaire
laugh
the
more
do
like
the
he
said
bless
you
they
all
alike
not
yours
more
than
the
rest
but
as
i
was
saying
if
it
warranted
safe
i
suppose
he
have
to
stay
but
i
do
stand
any
nonsense
may
and
look
here
your
music
and
all
that
ai
in
the
agreement
he
can
have
a
master
for
his
music
he
well
enough
able
to
pay
for
it
but
i
have
a
mistress
by
george
to
put
folly
into
his
head
i
am
to
forbid
him
the
i
suppose
and
take
his
fiddle
from
him
i
have
no
objections
between
ourselves
as
i
am
not
musical
it
would
be
very
agreeable
to
me
but
perhaps
he
is
rather
over
the
age
do
you
think
for
treatment
of
that
kind
clarence
had
come
in
and
stood
watching
the
conversation
with
a
look
copperhead
was
not
prepared
for
those
mild
brown
eyes
which
were
his
mother
share
in
him
were
full
with
sullen
resolution
and
his
heavy
mouth
shut
like
that
of
a
he
lingered
at
the
door
looking
at
the
conversation
which
was
going
on
between
his
father
and
his
tutor
and
they
both
noticed
him
at
the
same
moment
and
drew
the
same
conclusion
may
was
in
possession
of
the
as
the
french
say
and
he
added
instinctively
in
an
undertone
take
care
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
try
him
too
far
copperhead
said
nothing
but
he
stared
too
rather
aghast
at
this
new
revelation
what
his
porcelain
his
dresden
figure
of
a
son
his
crowning
curiosity
was
going
to
show
a
will
of
his
own
the
despot
felt
a
thrill
go
over
him
what
kind
of
a
sentiment
love
was
in
his
mind
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
but
his
pride
was
all
set
on
this
heavy
boy
to
see
him
a
man
of
note
in
parliament
his
name
in
the
papers
his
speeches
printed
in
the
times
was
the
very
heaven
of
his
expectations
son
of
the
famous
copperhead
the
great
contractor
he
did
not
care
about
such
distinction
in
his
own
person
but
this
had
been
his
dream
ever
since
clarence
came
into
being
and
now
there
he
stood
gloomy
obdurate
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
make
a
low
marriage
could
his
father
hinder
him
could
anything
hinder
him
copperhead
looked
at
his
son
and
quailed
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
may
he
said
hurriedly
do
the
best
you
can
he
got
all
his
mother
d
d
obstinacy
you
can
see
ca
you
but
i
set
my
heart
on
making
a
man
of
him
do
the
best
you
can
may
thought
to
himself
afterwards
if
he
had
only
had
the
vigour
to
say
pay
me
six
months
in
advance
the
thing
would
have
been
done
but
the
lingering
prejudices
of
breeding
clung
about
him
and
he
could
not
do
it
copperhead
however
was
very
friendly
all
the
rest
of
the
day
and
gave
him
private
looks
and
words
aside
to
the
great
admiration
of
the
dorsets
to
whom
the
alliance
between
them
appeared
remarkable
enough
chapter
xxxix
a
catastrophe
may
left
the
hall
before
dinner
notwithstanding
the
warm
invitation
which
was
given
to
him
to
stay
he
was
rather
restless
and
though
it
was
hard
to
go
out
into
the
dark
just
as
grateful
odours
began
to
steal
through
the
house
it
suited
him
better
to
do
so
than
to
spend
the
night
away
from
home
besides
he
comforted
himself
that
sir
robert
cook
was
not
not
good
enough
to
make
it
a
great
temptation
it
was
a
long
walk
to
the
station
for
they
had
no
horses
at
liberty
to
drive
him
a
fact
at
which
he
was
slightly
offended
though
he
was
aware
that
sir
robert
stable
was
but
a
poor
one
he
set
out
just
as
the
began
to
ring
fortified
with
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
biscuit
the
night
was
mild
and
soft
the
hedgerows
all
rustling
with
the
new
life
of
the
spring
and
the
stars
beginning
to
come
out
as
he
went
on
and
on
the
whole
the
walk
was
pleasant
though
the
roads
were
somewhat
muddy
as
he
went
along
he
felt
himself
fall
into
a
curious
dreamy
state
of
mind
which
was
partly
fatigue
perhaps
but
was
not
at
all
unpleasant
sometimes
he
almost
seemed
to
himself
to
be
asleep
as
he
trudged
on
and
woke
up
with
a
start
thinking
that
he
saw
indistinct
figures
the
skirt
of
a
dress
or
the
tail
of
a
long
coat
disappearing
past
him
just
gone
before
he
was
fully
awake
to
what
it
was
he
knew
there
was
no
one
on
the
lonely
road
and
that
this
was
a
dream
or
illusion
but
still
he
kept
seeing
these
vanishings
of
indistinct
wayfarers
which
did
not
frighten
him
in
the
least
but
him
in
the
curious
state
of
his
brain
he
had
got
rid
of
his
anxiety
it
was
all
quite
plain
before
him
what
to
do
to
go
to
the
bank
to
tell
them
what
he
had
coming
in
and
to
settle
everything
as
easily
as
possible
the
consciousness
of
having
this
to
do
acted
upon
him
like
a
gentle
opiate
or
when
he
got
to
the
railway
station
and
got
into
a
carriage
he
seemed
to
be
floating
somehow
in
a
prolonged
vision
of
light
and
streaks
of
darkness
not
quite
aware
now
far
he
was
going
or
where
he
was
going
across
the
country
and
even
when
he
arrived
at
carlingford
he
roused
himself
with
difficulty
not
quite
certain
that
he
had
to
get
out
then
he
smiled
at
himself
seeing
the
in
a
sort
of
vague
glimmer
about
him
not
uncomfortable
but
misty
and
if
sir
robert
sherry
had
been
better
i
should
have
blamed
that
he
said
to
himself
and
in
fact
it
was
a
kind
of
drowsy
amiable
mental
intoxication
which
affected
him
he
scarcely
could
tell
how
when
he
got
within
sight
of
his
own
house
he
paused
a
moment
and
looked
up
at
the
lights
in
the
windows
there
was
music
going
on
phoebe
no
doubt
for
ursula
could
not
play
so
well
as
that
and
the
house
looked
full
and
cheerful
he
had
a
cheerful
home
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
young
copperhead
though
he
was
a
dunce
felt
it
and
showed
an
appreciation
of
better
things
in
his
determination
not
to
leave
the
house
where
he
had
been
so
happy
may
felt
an
amiable
friendliness
stealing
over
him
for
clarence
too
upstairs
in
the
another
idyllic
evening
had
begun
phoebe
had
not
intended
to
come
but
was
there
notwithstanding
persuaded
by
ursula
who
glad
for
once
to
escape
from
the
anxieties
of
dinner
had
celebrated
tea
with
the
children
to
their
great
delight
though
she
was
still
too
dreamy
and
to
respond
much
to
them
and
northcote
had
not
intended
to
come
indeed
he
had
gone
further
than
this
he
had
intended
to
keep
away
but
when
he
had
eaten
his
solitary
dinner
he
too
had
strayed
towards
the
centre
of
attraction
and
walking
up
and
down
in
forlorn
contemplation
of
the
lighted
windows
had
been
spied
by
reginald
and
brought
in
after
a
faint
resistance
so
the
four
were
together
again
with
only
janey
to
interpose
an
edge
of
general
criticism
and
remark
into
the
too
personal
strain
of
the
conversation
janey
did
not
quite
realize
the
importance
of
the
place
she
was
occupying
but
she
was
keenly
interested
in
all
that
was
going
on
very
eager
to
understand
the
relationships
in
which
the
others
stood
and
to
see
for
herself
what
progress
had
been
made
last
night
while
she
was
absent
her
sharp
girlish
face
in
which
the
eyes
seemed
too
big
for
the
features
expressed
a
totally
different
phase
of
existence
from
that
which
softened
and
subdued
the
others
she
was
all
eyes
and
ears
and
watchful
scrutiny
it
was
she
who
prevented
the
utterance
of
the
words
trembling
on
northcote
lips
to
which
ursula
had
a
soft
response
fluttering
somewhere
in
her
pretty
throat
but
which
was
not
destined
to
be
spoken
and
it
was
she
who
made
music
quite
a
simple
performance
attended
with
little
excitement
and
no
danger
phoebe
was
the
only
one
who
was
grateful
to
her
and
perhaps
even
phoebe
could
have
enjoyed
the
agitations
of
the
evening
better
had
janey
been
away
as
it
was
these
agitations
were
all
suppressed
and
incipient
they
could
not
come
to
anything
there
were
no
hairbreadth
escapes
no
breathless
moments
when
the
one
pursued
had
to
exercise
her
best
skill
and
only
eluded
the
pursuer
by
a
step
or
two
janey
with
all
her
senses
about
her
hearing
everything
seeing
everything
neutralized
all
effort
on
the
part
of
the
lovers
and
reduced
the
condition
of
ursula
and
phoebe
to
one
of
absolute
safety
they
were
all
kept
on
the
curb
in
the
leash
by
the
presence
of
this
youthful
observer
and
the
evening
though
full
of
a
certain
excitement
and
mixture
of
happiness
and
misery
glided
on
but
slowly
each
of
the
young
men
outdoing
the
other
in
a
savage
eagerness
for
janey
do
you
let
her
sit
up
till
midnight
every
night
said
reginald
with
indignation
let
me
sit
up
cried
janey
as
if
i
was
obliged
to
do
what
she
tells
me
ursula
gave
a
little
shrug
to
her
pretty
shoulders
and
looked
at
the
clock
it
is
not
midnight
yet
it
is
not
nine
she
said
with
a
sigh
i
should
have
thought
papa
would
have
come
home
before
now
can
he
be
staying
at
the
hall
all
night
just
then
however
there
was
the
ring
at
the
bell
and
ursula
ran
downstairs
to
see
after
her
father
supper
why
janey
make
herself
useful
and
do
that
the
little
company
thought
indignantly
and
with
one
accord
instead
of
staying
here
with
her
sharp
eyes
putting
everybody
out
may
little
dinner
or
supper
served
on
a
tray
was
very
comfortable
and
he
ate
it
with
great
satisfaction
telling
ursula
that
he
had
on
the
whole
spent
a
pleasant
day
the
dorsets
were
kind
as
they
always
are
and
copperhead
was
a
little
less
disagreeable
than
he
always
is
and
you
may
look
for
clarence
back
again
in
a
day
or
two
he
is
not
going
to
leave
us
you
must
take
care
that
he
does
not
fall
in
love
with
you
ursula
that
is
the
chief
thing
they
seem
to
be
afraid
of
fall
in
love
with
cried
ursula
oh
papa
where
are
your
eyes
he
has
fallen
in
love
but
not
with
me
ca
you
see
it
it
is
phoebe
he
cares
for
may
was
startled
he
raised
his
head
with
a
curious
smile
in
his
eyes
which
made
ursula
wonder
painfully
whether
her
father
had
taken
much
wine
at
the
hall
ah
ha
is
that
what
they
are
frightened
for
he
said
and
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
she
will
show
bad
taste
ursula
she
might
do
better
but
i
suppose
a
girl
of
her
class
has
not
the
delicacy
so
that
is
what
they
are
frightened
for
and
what
are
the
other
fish
have
to
fry
papa
yes
he
told
me
he
was
not
alarmed
about
you
that
you
had
other
fish
to
fry
eh
well
it
too
late
for
explanations
what
that
very
odd
i
thought
i
saw
some
one
going
out
at
the
door
just
a
whiff
of
the
i
think
my
digestion
must
be
out
of
order
i
go
into
the
study
and
get
my
pills
and
then
i
think
i
go
to
bed
wo
you
come
upstairs
to
the
said
ursula
faltering
for
she
was
appalled
by
the
idea
of
explanations
what
had
she
to
explain
as
yet
may
shook
his
head
with
that
smile
still
upon
his
face
no
you
get
on
excellently
well
without
me
i
had
a
long
walk
and
i
think
i
go
to
bed
you
do
look
very
well
papa
oh
yes
i
well
enough
only
confused
in
the
head
a
little
with
fatigue
and
the
things
i
had
to
think
about
do
keep
those
young
fellows
late
though
one
of
them
is
your
brother
you
can
say
i
tired
my
dear
it
was
very
seldom
that
he
called
her
my
dear
or
indeed
said
anything
affectionate
to
his
children
if
ursula
had
not
been
so
eager
to
return
to
the
and
so
sure
that
they
would
miss
her
she
would
have
been
anxious
about
her
father
but
as
it
was
she
ran
upstairs
lightly
when
he
stopped
speaking
and
left
him
going
into
the
study
where
already
his
lamp
was
burning
betsy
passed
her
as
she
ran
up
the
stairs
coming
from
the
kitchen
with
a
letter
held
between
two
folds
of
her
apron
poor
papa
no
doubt
it
was
some
tiresome
parish
business
to
bother
him
when
he
was
tired
already
but
ursula
did
not
stop
for
that
how
she
wanted
to
be
there
again
among
them
all
even
though
janey
still
made
one
she
went
in
breathless
and
gave
her
father
message
only
he
was
tired
we
are
never
to
mind
he
says
so
they
all
took
the
intimation
very
easily
may
being
tired
what
did
that
matter
he
would
no
doubt
be
better
and
in
the
mean
time
those
sweet
hours
though
so
hampered
by
janey
were
very
sweet
betsy
went
in
and
put
down
the
note
before
may
on
his
table
he
was
just
taking
out
his
medicine
from
the
drawer
and
he
made
a
wry
face
at
the
note
and
at
the
pills
together
parish
he
said
curtly
no
sir
it
from
cotsdean
he
came
this
morning
after
gone
and
he
sent
over
little
bobby
that
will
do
a
presentiment
of
pain
stole
over
him
he
gave
betsy
a
nod
of
dismissal
and
went
on
with
what
he
was
doing
after
he
had
finished
he
took
up
the
little
note
from
the
table
with
a
look
of
disgust
it
was
badly
scrawled
badly
folded
and
dirty
thank
heaven
communications
would
soon
be
over
now
janey
had
proposed
a
round
game
upstairs
they
were
all
humble
in
their
desire
to
conciliate
that
young
despot
reginald
got
the
cards
and
northcote
put
chairs
round
the
table
he
placed
ursula
next
to
himself
which
was
a
consolation
and
sat
down
by
her
close
to
her
though
not
a
word
except
of
the
most
commonplace
kind
could
be
said
just
then
what
was
it
an
indescribable
thrill
through
the
house
the
sound
of
a
heavy
fall
they
all
started
up
from
their
seats
to
hear
what
it
was
then
ursula
with
a
cry
of
apprehension
rushed
downstairs
and
the
others
after
her
betsy
alarmed
had
come
out
of
the
kitchen
followed
by
her
assistant
and
was
standing
frightened
but
irresolute
for
may
was
not
a
man
to
be
disturbed
with
impunity
and
this
might
be
nothing
the
falling
of
a
chair
or
a
table
and
nothing
more
what
is
it
cried
ursula
in
an
anxious
whisper
she
was
the
leader
in
the
emergency
for
even
reginald
held
back
then
after
a
moment
pause
she
opened
the
door
and
with
a
little
cry
rushed
in
it
was
as
they
feared
may
who
had
fallen
but
he
had
so
far
recovered
himself
as
to
be
able
to
make
efforts
to
rise
his
face
was
towards
them
it
was
very
pale
of
a
livid
colour
and
covered
with
moisture
great
beads
standing
on
his
forehead
he
smiled
vaguely
when
he
saw
the
circle
of
faces
nothing
nothing
a
faintness
he
faltered
making
again
an
effort
to
rise
what
is
it
papa
oh
what
the
matter
cried
janey
rushing
at
him
and
seizing
him
by
the
arm
get
up
get
up
what
will
people
think
oh
ursula
how
queer
he
looks
and
he
feels
so
heavy
oh
please
get
up
papa
go
away
said
may
go
away
it
is
a
faintness
i
am
very
well
where
i
am
but
he
did
not
resist
when
reginald
and
northcote
lifted
him
from
the
floor
he
had
a
piece
of
paper
tightly
clasped
in
his
hand
he
gave
them
a
strange
suspicious
look
all
round
and
shrank
when
his
eyes
fell
upon
phoebe
do
let
her
know
he
said
take
me
away
take
me
away
reginald
will
take
you
upstairs
papa
to
your
room
to
bed
you
ought
to
go
to
bed
it
is
the
long
walk
that
has
worn
you
out
oh
reginald
do
contradict
him
let
him
go
where
he
pleases
oh
papa
where
you
going
cried
ursula
the
other
way
you
want
to
go
to
bed
this
way
take
me
somewhere
said
the
sufferer
though
he
could
not
stand
he
made
a
step
staggering
between
them
and
an
effort
to
push
towards
the
hall
door
and
when
they
directed
him
in
the
other
direction
to
the
staircase
which
led
to
his
room
he
struggled
feebly
yet
violently
with
them
no
no
no
not
there
he
cried
the
sudden
confusion
dismay
and
alarm
into
which
the
family
was
plunged
the
strange
sense
of
a
catastrophe
that
came
upon
them
can
not
be
told
ursula
calling
out
all
the
time
that
they
were
not
to
contradict
him
insisted
imperiously
with
words
and
gestures
that
he
should
be
taken
upstairs
janey
altogether
overcome
sat
down
on
the
lower
steps
of
the
staircase
and
cried
reginald
almost
as
pale
as
his
father
and
not
saying
a
word
urged
him
towards
the
stairs
to
get
him
up
to
his
room
resisting
as
well
as
he
could
and
moaning
inarticulate
remonstrances
all
the
way
was
no
easy
business
as
the
procession
toiled
along
phoebe
was
left
below
the
only
one
in
possession
of
her
faculties
she
sent
the
housemaid
hurriedly
off
for
the
doctor
and
despatched
betsy
to
the
kitchen
hot
water
is
always
wanted
said
phoebe
see
that
you
have
enough
in
case
he
should
require
a
bath
then
with
her
usual
decision
she
stepped
back
into
the
study
it
was
not
vulgar
curiosity
which
was
in
phoebe
mind
nor
did
it
occur
to
her
that
she
had
no
right
to
investigate
may
private
affairs
if
she
could
find
what
had
done
it
would
not
that
be
a
great
matter
something
to
tell
the
doctor
to
throw
light
on
so
mysterious
a
seizure
several
bits
of
torn
paper
were
lying
on
the
floor
but
only
one
of
these
was
big
enough
to
contain
any
information
it
was
torn
in
a
kind
of
triangular
shape
and
contained
a
corner
of
a
letter
a
section
of
three
lines
must
have
mistaken
the
date
presented
paid
by
tozer
was
what
she
read
she
could
not
believe
her
eyes
what
transactions
could
there
be
between
her
grandfather
and
may
she
secured
the
scrap
of
paper
furtively
putting
it
into
her
pocket
it
was
better
to
say
nothing
either
to
the
doctor
or
any
one
else
of
anything
so
utterly
incomprehensible
it
oppressed
phoebe
with
a
sense
of
mystery
and
of
personal
connection
with
the
mystery
which
even
her
could
scarcely
bear
up
against
she
went
into
the
kitchen
after
betsy
avowedly
in
anxious
concern
for
the
boiling
of
the
kettle
hot
water
is
good
for
everything
said
phoebe
mamma
says
a
hot
bath
is
the
best
of
remedies
did
may
have
anything
to
worry
him
betsy
i
suppose
it
is
only
fatigue
and
that
he
has
taken
too
long
a
walk
i
do
believe
in
the
long
walk
miss
said
betsy
it
that
cotsdean
as
is
always
with
his
dirty
letters
when
that
man
comes
bothering
here
master
is
always
put
out
cotsdean
i
do
know
the
name
do
say
nothing
miss
said
betsy
sinking
her
voice
but
you
take
my
word
it
money
money
at
the
bottom
of
everything
it
something
as
sure
as
you
alive
as
master
has
got
to
pay
i
been
a
deal
with
gentlefolks
added
betsy
and
a
one
of
them
can
abide
that
chapter
xl
the
phoebe
mind
was
full
of
many
and
somewhat
agitating
thoughts
she
went
upstairs
with
a
restless
haste
which
she
would
have
been
the
first
to
condemn
to
the
room
where
the
others
were
congregated
when
they
had
laid
may
on
his
bed
with
no
small
difficulty
and
were
now
consulting
what
to
do
ursula
had
fallen
a
little
from
the
position
of
command
she
had
taken
up
to
get
him
to
bed
to
send
for
the
doctor
these
were
evident
practical
steps
to
take
but
after
having
done
these
she
was
bewildered
and
fell
back
upon
her
advisers
we
ca
do
anything
we
can
only
wait
and
watch
him
reginald
was
saying
as
phoebe
herself
unseen
looked
in
at
the
anxious
party
and
without
asking
any
question
she
turned
and
went
downstairs
again
and
hastily
putting
on
her
shawl
and
hat
went
out
shutting
the
door
softly
and
ran
home
on
the
shady
side
of
grange
lane
where
nobody
could
see
her
it
was
a
very
quiet
road
and
she
was
not
disturbed
by
any
unreasonable
alarms
it
was
still
early
when
she
got
home
earlier
than
usual
and
her
intention
was
not
to
stay
there
at
all
but
to
go
back
again
and
offer
her
assistance
to
ursula
for
whom
she
had
left
a
message
to
this
effect
phoebe
was
full
of
genuine
regard
and
friendliness
towards
the
mays
she
felt
that
she
had
obligations
to
all
of
them
to
the
for
submitting
to
her
presence
nay
encouraging
it
and
to
ursula
for
receiving
her
with
that
affectionate
fervour
of
friendship
which
had
completely
changed
the
tenor
of
phoebe
life
at
carlingford
she
was
obliged
to
them
and
she
knew
that
she
was
obliged
to
them
how
different
these
three
months
would
have
been
but
for
the
parsonage
what
a
heavy
existence
without
variety
and
without
interest
she
must
have
lived
whereas
it
had
gone
by
like
a
summer
day
full
of
real
life
of
multiplied
interests
of
everything
that
it
was
most
desirable
to
have
not
at
home
and
in
london
could
she
have
had
the
advantages
she
had
enjoyed
here
phoebe
was
sensible
enough
or
perhaps
we
might
use
a
less
complimentary
word
worldly
enough
to
count
within
those
manifest
benefits
the
advantage
of
seeing
more
of
clarence
copperhead
and
of
drawing
him
within
the
charmed
circle
of
her
influence
and
she
was
grateful
to
the
mays
for
this
was
their
doing
and
then
on
the
other
hand
quite
a
different
thing
her
heart
was
touched
and
softened
with
gratitude
to
reginald
for
loving
her
of
all
her
gratitudes
perhaps
this
indeed
was
the
most
truly
felt
they
had
given
her
unbounded
kindness
friendliness
everything
that
is
most
sweet
to
the
solitary
and
over
and
above
as
if
these
were
not
enough
they
had
made
her
the
exquisite
present
of
a
heart
the
best
thing
that
can
be
given
or
received
by
man
phoebe
felt
herself
penetrated
with
gratitude
for
all
this
and
she
resolved
that
if
anything
she
could
do
could
benefit
the
mays
the
effort
on
her
part
should
not
be
wanting
paid
by
tozer
what
had
been
paid
by
tozer
what
had
her
grandfather
to
do
with
it
could
it
be
he
who
had
lent
money
to
may
then
phoebe
resolved
with
a
glow
on
her
face
he
should
forgive
his
debtors
she
went
in
with
her
mind
fully
made
up
whatever
might
happen
to
be
the
champion
of
the
sufferer
the
saviour
of
the
family
this
would
show
them
that
their
kindness
had
been
appreciated
this
would
prove
even
to
reginald
that
though
she
would
not
sacrifice
her
own
prospects
by
marrying
him
yet
that
she
was
grateful
to
him
to
the
bottom
of
her
heart
her
mind
was
full
of
generous
ardour
as
she
went
in
she
knew
her
power
her
grandfather
had
never
yet
refused
her
anything
never
resisted
her
and
it
did
not
seem
likely
that
he
should
begin
now
tozer
was
by
herself
in
the
parlour
dozing
over
the
fire
she
woke
up
with
a
little
start
when
phoebe
came
in
and
smiled
at
the
sight
of
her
i
did
expect
as
you
have
come
so
soon
she
said
you
broke
up
early
darling
could
you
have
no
music
i
did
look
for
you
for
an
hour
or
more
you
know
grandmamma
it
is
copperhead
who
teases
me
most
for
music
and
he
is
not
here
yes
yes
know
said
the
old
lady
nodding
her
head
with
many
smiles
i
know
a
deal
more
about
it
than
you
think
for
phoebe
and
do
you
think
as
i
disapprove
for
it
quite
the
other
way
but
you
wo
tell
me
as
there
ai
others
as
cares
for
music
as
well
as
young
copperhead
i
seen
one
as
could
take
his
eyes
off
of
you
while
you
were
playing
hush
grandmamma
the
others
like
music
for
music
sake
or
perhaps
for
my
sake
but
mr
copperhead
likes
it
for
his
own
sake
and
therefore
he
is
the
one
who
insists
upon
it
but
this
is
not
the
reason
why
i
have
come
home
so
soon
may
has
been
taken
suddenly
lord
bless
us
cried
tozer
deary
deary
me
i
very
sorry
poor
gentleman
i
hope
it
ai
anything
serious
though
he
a
church
parson
he
a
very
man
and
i
see
his
children
drag
him
into
his
own
house
one
day
as
me
and
tozer
was
passing
i
said
to
tozer
at
the
time
you
take
my
word
whatever
folks
say
a
man
as
lets
his
children
pull
him
about
like
that
ai
a
bad
one
and
so
he
ill
poor
man
is
there
anything
as
we
can
do
to
help
my
dear
they
ai
rich
and
they
been
as
kind
to
you
as
if
you
been
one
of
their
own
i
thought
that
would
be
the
first
thing
you
would
ask
me
said
phoebe
gratefully
giving
her
a
kiss
dear
grandmamma
it
is
like
your
kind
heart
and
i
ran
off
to
see
that
you
were
quite
well
and
comfortable
thinking
perhaps
if
you
did
not
want
me
i
might
go
back
to
poor
ursula
for
the
night
to
hear
her
granddaughter
call
miss
may
by
her
christian
name
was
in
itself
a
pleasure
to
tozer
she
gave
phoebe
a
hug
so
you
shall
my
darling
and
as
for
a
bottle
of
good
wine
or
that
anything
as
is
in
the
house
you
know
you
welcome
to
it
you
go
and
talk
to
your
grandfather
i
as
comfortable
as
i
can
be
and
if
you
like
to
run
back
to
that
poor
child
not
before
you
are
in
bed
said
phoebe
but
if
you
please
i
go
and
talk
to
grandpapa
as
you
said
there
are
things
in
which
a
man
may
be
of
use
to
be
sure
said
tozer
doubtfully
your
grandfather
ai
a
man
as
is
much
good
in
sickness
but
i
wo
say
as
there
ai
some
things
yes
grandmamma
i
take
your
advice
and
run
and
talk
to
him
and
by
the
time
i
come
back
you
will
be
ready
for
bed
do
my
dear
said
tozer
she
was
very
comfortable
and
did
not
care
to
move
just
then
and
as
phoebe
went
away
looked
after
her
with
dreamy
satisfaction
bless
her
there
ai
her
match
in
carlingford
and
the
gentlefolks
sees
it
said
tozer
to
herself
but
she
had
no
idea
how
phoebe
heart
was
beating
as
she
went
along
the
passage
which
led
to
a
small
room
fitted
up
by
tozer
for
himself
she
heard
voices
in
earnest
talk
as
she
approached
but
this
made
her
only
the
more
eager
to
go
in
and
see
for
herself
what
was
going
on
there
could
be
no
doubt
she
felt
sure
of
it
that
the
discussion
here
had
some
connection
with
the
calamity
what
it
was
she
had
not
the
slightest
idea
but
that
somehow
the
two
were
connected
she
felt
certain
the
voices
were
loud
as
she
approached
the
door
i
find
out
who
done
it
and
i
punish
him
as
sure
as
that
my
name
though
i
never
put
it
on
that
there
paper
tozer
was
saying
phoebe
opened
the
door
boldly
and
went
in
she
had
never
seen
her
grandfather
look
so
unlike
himself
the
knot
of
the
big
white
neckerchief
round
his
neck
was
pushed
away
his
eyes
were
red
giving
out
strange
lights
of
passion
he
was
standing
in
front
of
the
fireplace
gesticulating
wildly
though
it
was
now
april
and
the
weather
very
mild
and
genial
there
were
still
fires
in
the
tozer
and
as
the
windows
were
carefully
shut
phoebe
felt
the
atmosphere
stifling
the
other
person
in
the
room
was
a
serious
large
man
whom
she
had
already
seen
more
than
once
one
of
the
chief
clerks
in
the
bank
where
tozer
kept
his
account
who
had
an
old
acquaintance
with
the
butterman
and
who
was
in
the
habit
of
coming
when
the
bank
had
anything
to
say
to
so
sure
a
customer
about
rates
of
investment
or
the
value
of
money
he
was
seated
at
one
side
of
the
fire
looking
very
grave
and
shaking
his
head
as
the
other
spoke
that
is
very
true
and
i
do
say
anything
against
it
but
tozer
i
ca
help
thinking
there
some
one
else
in
it
than
cotsdean
what
one
else
what
is
the
good
of
coming
here
to
me
with
a
pack
of
nonsense
he
a
poor
needy
creature
as
has
a
penny
to
bless
himself
with
a
lot
of
children
and
a
wife
as
drinks
do
talk
to
me
of
some
one
else
that
the
sort
of
man
as
does
all
the
mischief
what
phoebe
run
away
to
your
grandmother
i
do
want
you
here
i
am
very
sorry
to
interrupt
you
grandpapa
may
i
stay
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
tozer
turned
round
and
looked
at
her
eagerly
partly
his
own
fancy
and
partly
his
wife
more
enlightened
observations
had
made
him
aware
that
it
was
possible
that
phoebe
might
one
day
have
something
very
interesting
to
reveal
so
her
words
roused
him
even
in
the
midst
of
his
he
looked
at
her
for
a
second
then
he
waved
his
hand
and
said
i
busy
go
away
my
dear
go
away
i
ca
talk
to
you
now
phoebe
gave
the
visitor
a
look
which
perplexed
him
but
which
meant
if
he
could
but
have
read
it
an
earnest
entreaty
to
him
to
go
away
she
said
to
herself
impatiently
that
he
would
have
understood
had
he
been
a
woman
but
as
it
was
he
only
stared
with
eyes
what
was
she
to
do
grandpapa
she
said
decisively
it
is
too
late
for
business
however
urgent
it
may
be
you
ca
do
anything
why
it
is
nearly
ten
and
most
people
are
going
to
bed
see
i
mean
this
gentleman
morning
the
first
thing
for
you
know
however
anxious
you
may
be
you
ca
do
anything
that
is
true
enough
he
said
looking
with
staring
eyes
from
her
to
his
visitor
and
more
the
pity
what
had
to
be
done
should
ha
been
done
it
should
have
been
done
sir
on
the
spot
not
left
over
night
like
this
to
give
the
villain
time
to
get
away
it
a
crime
phoebe
that
what
it
is
that
the
fact
it
a
crime
well
grandpapa
i
am
very
sorry
but
it
will
not
mend
matters
will
it
if
sitting
up
like
this
and
agitating
yourself
like
this
makes
you
ill
that
will
not
do
away
with
the
crime
it
is
and
poor
grandmamma
is
dozing
and
wondering
what
has
become
of
you
grandpapa
phoebe
go
away
it
ai
none
of
your
business
you
only
a
bit
of
a
girl
and
how
can
you
understand
if
you
think
i
going
to
sit
down
with
it
like
an
old
fool
lose
my
money
and
what
is
worse
nor
my
money
let
my
very
name
be
forged
before
my
eyes
phoebe
gave
so
perceptible
a
start
that
tozer
stopped
short
and
even
the
looked
at
her
with
aroused
curiosity
forged
she
cried
with
a
gasp
of
dismay
is
it
so
bad
as
that
she
had
never
been
more
near
betraying
herself
showing
a
personal
interest
more
close
than
was
natural
when
she
saw
the
risk
she
was
running
she
stopped
short
and
summoned
all
her
energies
i
thought
some
one
had
pilfered
something
she
said
with
an
attempt
at
a
laugh
i
beg
your
pardon
grandpapa
but
anyhow
what
can
you
do
you
are
keeping
this
gentleman
and
yourself
out
of
bed
please
put
it
off
till
i
think
so
too
said
the
banker
clerk
i
come
to
you
in
the
morning
as
i
go
to
the
bank
perhaps
i
may
have
been
wrong
but
i
think
there
more
in
it
than
meets
the
eye
we
can
have
the
man
cotsdean
up
and
question
him
after
he
had
time
to
take
himself
off
said
tozer
vehemently
you
take
my
word
he
ai
in
carlingford
not
now
let
alone
then
that
shows
said
phoebe
quietly
that
it
is
of
no
use
making
yourself
ill
grandpapa
let
this
gentleman
go
he
wants
to
go
and
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
you
can
do
anything
that
is
necessary
i
think
so
indeed
said
simpson
of
the
bank
getting
up
at
last
the
young
lady
is
quite
right
we
ca
act
hastily
in
a
thing
like
this
cotsdean
a
man
of
good
character
tozer
all
that
has
to
be
taken
into
account
and
he
is
not
a
beggar
if
he
has
done
it
we
can
recover
something
at
least
but
if
he
has
been
taken
advantage
of
i
think
the
young
lady
is
a
good
counsellor
and
that
it
much
the
best
to
wait
till
phoebe
seized
upon
her
grandfather
arm
to
restrain
him
and
held
him
back
she
said
grandpapa
stay
with
me
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
listen
you
do
think
me
very
silly
do
you
grandpapa
dear
silly
he
said
listening
to
the
steps
of
the
departing
visitor
as
they
receded
along
the
passage
what
has
a
chit
like
you
to
do
with
business
i
tell
you
it
kill
me
me
of
accommodation
bills
for
a
bit
of
a
small
shopkeeper
like
that
cotsdean
i
tell
you
make
an
end
of
me
that
will
unless
i
gets
my
money
and
clears
myself
afore
the
world
and
here
you
been
and
sent
away
simpson
and
to
manage
for
me
i
ai
a
lawyer
to
know
what
to
do
get
away
get
away
and
leave
me
to
myself
i
ca
be
disturbed
with
when
i
got
real
business
in
hand
i
manage
for
you
said
phoebe
you
need
not
stare
at
me
like
that
grandpapa
go
out
o
the
room
this
moment
miss
he
cried
furious
you
here
a
sort
of
thing
for
me
to
put
up
with
sam
tozer
was
born
yesterday
that
a
bit
of
an
impudent
girl
should
take
upon
her
to
do
for
him
manage
for
me
go
out
o
my
sight
i
a
fool
am
i
and
in
my
dotage
to
have
a
pack
of
women
meddling
in
my
affairs
phoebe
had
never
met
with
such
an
outburst
of
coarse
anger
in
her
life
before
and
it
gave
her
a
shock
as
such
assaults
naturally
do
to
people
brought
up
softly
and
used
to
nothing
but
kindness
for
a
moment
she
wavered
doubtful
whether
she
should
not
proudly
abandon
him
and
his
affairs
altogether
but
this
was
to
abandon
her
friends
too
she
mastered
herself
accordingly
and
the
resentment
which
she
could
not
help
feeling
and
stood
pale
but
quiet
opposite
to
the
infuriated
old
man
his
grey
eyes
seemed
to
give
out
sparks
of
fire
his
hair
bristled
up
on
his
head
like
the
coat
of
a
wild
animal
enraged
he
went
up
and
down
on
the
like
the
same
animal
in
a
cage
shaking
his
fist
at
some
imaginary
culprit
once
i
get
him
see
if
i
let
him
go
he
cried
his
voice
thick
with
words
and
the
foam
of
fury
let
the
bank
do
as
it
likes
i
have
him
i
will
i
see
justice
on
the
man
as
has
dared
to
make
free
with
my
name
it
ai
nothing
to
you
my
name
but
i
kep
it
honest
and
out
of
folk
mouths
and
see
if
i
stand
disgrace
thrown
on
it
now
a
bill
on
me
as
never
had
such
a
thing
not
when
i
was
struggling
to
get
on
dash
him
damn
him
cried
the
old
man
transported
with
rage
when
he
had
come
to
this
unusual
and
terrible
length
tozer
paused
dismayed
he
had
lost
his
temper
before
in
his
life
but
very
seldom
had
he
been
betrayed
into
anything
so
desperate
as
this
he
stopped
aghast
and
cast
a
look
at
phoebe
who
stood
there
so
quiet
subdued
out
of
her
usual
force
pale
and
disapproving
his
own
grandchild
a
pastor
daughter
and
he
had
forgotten
himself
thus
before
her
he
blushed
hotly
though
he
was
not
used
to
blushing
and
stopped
all
at
once
after
such
frightful
language
so
unbecoming
a
deacon
of
salem
so
unlike
a
consistent
member
of
the
connection
what
could
he
say
grandpapa
said
phoebe
softly
it
is
not
good
to
be
so
angry
you
are
made
to
say
things
you
are
sorry
for
will
you
listen
to
me
now
though
you
do
think
it
and
perhaps
wo
believe
it
i
have
found
out
something
quite
by
chance
he
went
up
to
her
and
clutched
her
by
the
arm
then
what
are
you
there
for
like
a
figure
in
stone
ca
you
out
with
it
and
ease
my
mind
out
with
it
i
tell
you
do
you
want
to
drive
me
out
of
my
senses
he
was
so
much
excited
that
he
shook
her
in
the
hot
paroxysm
of
returning
rage
phoebe
was
not
frightened
but
indignation
made
her
pale
she
stood
without
flinching
and
looked
at
him
till
poor
old
tozer
let
go
his
hold
and
dropping
into
a
chair
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
she
was
too
generous
to
take
advantage
of
him
but
went
on
quietly
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
grandpapa
as
i
tell
you
i
have
found
out
something
by
chance
that
has
to
do
with
the
thing
that
troubles
you
but
i
do
know
quite
what
it
is
tell
me
first
and
then
is
this
the
thing
said
phoebe
curiously
taking
up
a
slip
of
paper
from
the
table
a
stamped
piece
of
paper
in
a
handwriting
which
seemed
horribly
familiar
to
her
and
yet
strange
tozer
nodded
at
her
gloomily
holding
his
head
between
his
hands
and
phoebe
read
over
the
first
few
words
before
her
with
an
aching
heart
and
eyes
that
seemed
to
ache
in
sympathy
only
a
few
words
but
what
evidence
of
guilt
what
pitiful
misery
in
them
she
did
not
even
think
so
much
of
the
name
on
the
back
which
was
and
was
not
her
name
the
rest
of
the
bill
was
written
in
a
hand
disguised
and
changed
but
she
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
similar
writing
lately
and
she
recognized
it
with
a
sickening
at
her
heart
in
the
kind
of
fatherly
flirtation
which
had
been
innocently
carried
on
between
phoebe
and
her
friend
father
various
productions
of
his
in
manuscript
had
been
given
to
her
to
read
she
was
said
in
the
pleasant
social
jokes
of
the
party
to
be
more
skilled
in
interpreting
may
handwriting
than
any
of
his
family
she
stood
and
gazed
at
the
paper
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
of
pain
and
pity
the
openness
of
this
veiled
as
it
was
with
a
shadow
of
disguise
which
could
deceive
no
one
who
knew
him
went
to
phoebe
heart
what
could
he
have
done
it
for
mere
money
the
foolish
expenses
of
every
day
or
what
would
be
more
respectable
some
vague
mysterious
claim
upon
him
which
might
make
desperate
expedients
necessary
she
stood
temporarily
stupefied
with
her
eyes
full
looking
at
that
pitiful
terrible
guilty
bit
of
paper
stupefied
by
the
sudden
realization
of
her
sudden
guess
at
the
truth
though
indeed
the
truth
was
so
much
more
guilty
and
appalling
than
any
guess
of
hers
well
said
tozer
you
seen
it
and
now
what
do
you
think
of
it
that
my
name
mind
you
my
name
i
hope
the
almighty
will
grant
me
patience
stuck
on
to
what
they
calls
a
kite
an
accommodation
bill
what
do
you
think
of
that
miss
phoebe
if
i
had
hold
of
him
if
i
had
him
under
my
fists
if
i
had
him
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
grandpapa
does
it
say
in
the
bible
we
are
to
forgive
when
harm
is
done
to
us
phoebe
had
begun
to
tremble
all
over
for
the
first
time
she
doubted
her
own
power
he
got
up
again
and
began
to
prowl
about
the
table
round
and
round
with
the
same
wild
look
in
his
eyes
i
am
not
one
as
would
go
again
scripture
he
said
gloomily
but
that
a
spiritual
meaning
as
you
too
young
to
enter
into
you
suppose
as
scripture
would
approve
of
crime
or
let
them
escape
as
had
wronged
their
there
would
be
no
business
no
justice
no
trade
on
such
a
rule
as
that
but
grandpapa
do
you
but
me
you
seen
me
in
good
spirits
and
good
temper
phoebe
my
girl
but
you
do
know
old
sam
tozer
when
his
spirit
up
d
him
cried
the
old
man
striking
his
hand
violently
on
the
table
and
you
may
tell
your
father
as
is
a
minister
that
i
said
so
the
bible
spiritual
but
there
trade
and
there
justice
a
man
clear
of
what
he
done
because
you
forgive
him
what
the
law
for
else
forgive
you
may
forgive
him
as
fast
as
you
like
but
he
got
to
be
punished
all
the
same
but
not
by
you
by
the
law
cried
tozer
his
inflamed
eyes
seemed
to
glare
upon
her
his
rough
grey
hair
bristled
on
his
head
a
hot
redness
spread
across
his
face
beneath
his
fiery
eyes
which
seemed
to
scorch
the
cheek
with
angry
flames
the
law
that
ai
a
individual
that
for
our
protection
whether
we
like
it
or
not
what
that
got
to
do
with
forgiving
now
looking
at
it
in
a
public
way
i
ai
got
no
right
to
forgive
grandpapa
you
have
always
been
so
kind
always
so
good
to
everybody
i
have
heard
of
so
many
things
you
have
done
that
is
all
very
well
said
tozer
not
without
a
certain
gloomy
complacence
so
long
as
you
do
touch
but
the
moment
as
you
touches
me
i
another
man
that
what
i
ca
bear
nor
i
wo
them
as
tries
their
tricks
upon
me
sha
be
let
off
neither
for
wife
nor
child
and
do
you
think
my
girl
though
you
phoebe
junior
that
you
are
for
to
come
over
me
phoebe
could
not
but
shiver
in
her
fright
and
agitation
but
distressed
and
excited
as
she
was
she
found
means
to
take
a
step
which
was
important
indeed
though
at
the
moment
she
did
not
fully
realize
its
importance
and
did
it
by
instinct
only
she
had
a
handkerchief
in
her
hand
and
almost
without
consciousness
of
what
she
was
doing
she
crushed
up
the
miserable
bit
of
paper
which
was
the
cause
of
so
much
evil
and
misery
in
its
folds
he
was
far
too
impassioned
and
excited
to
observe
such
a
simple
proceeding
it
was
the
suggestion
of
a
moment
carried
out
in
another
moment
like
a
flash
of
lightning
and
as
soon
as
she
had
done
this
and
perceived
what
she
had
done
fortitude
and
comfort
came
back
to
phoebe
soul
you
will
not
hear
what
i
have
found
out
and
now
i
do
not
choose
to
tell
you
grandpapa
she
said
with
an
air
of
offence
unless
you
wish
to
be
ill
you
will
do
much
better
to
go
to
bed
it
is
your
usual
hour
and
i
am
going
to
grandmamma
say
please
i
am
going
out
again
to
stay
all
night
may
is
ill
and
i
ought
to
help
poor
ursula
you
go
a
deal
after
them
mays
said
tozer
with
a
cloud
over
his
face
yes
i
wonder
whom
else
i
should
go
after
who
has
been
kind
to
me
in
carlingford
except
the
mays
nobody
who
has
asked
me
to
go
to
their
house
and
share
everything
that
is
pleasant
in
it
none
of
your
salem
people
grandpapa
i
hope
i
am
not
ungrateful
and
whatever
happens
or
whatever
trouble
they
are
in
cried
phoebe
fervently
i
shall
stand
up
for
them
through
thick
and
thin
wherever
i
go
the
old
man
looked
at
her
with
a
startled
look
you
speak
up
bold
he
said
you
wo
get
put
upon
for
want
of
spirit
and
i
do
know
as
what
you
saying
ai
the
right
thing
though
i
do
hold
with
the
church
nor
parsons
ways
i
do
a
deal
myself
though
you
think
me
so
hard
and
cross
for
folks
as
has
been
kind
to
you
i
know
you
will
grandpapa
said
phoebe
with
a
slight
emphasis
which
startled
him
though
he
did
not
know
why
and
she
kissed
him
before
she
went
to
her
grandmother
which
she
did
with
a
perfectly
composed
and
tranquil
mind
it
was
astonishing
how
the
crackle
of
that
bit
of
paper
in
her
handkerchief
calmed
and
soothed
her
she
recovered
her
breath
her
colour
and
her
spirits
she
ran
up
to
her
room
and
changed
her
dress
which
was
silk
for
a
soft
merino
one
which
made
no
rustling
and
then
she
folded
the
bill
carefully
and
put
it
into
the
safe
keeping
of
the
little
purse
which
she
always
carried
in
her
pocket
no
one
would
think
of
searching
for
it
there
and
she
would
always
have
it
at
hand
whatever
happened
when
she
had
made
these
needful
arrangements
she
went
to
old
tozer
and
took
her
comfortably
upstairs
never
was
there
a
more
devoted
nurse
the
old
lady
chatted
cheerfully
yet
sympathetically
of
the
poor
gentleman
and
his
illness
with
the
of
an
invalid
in
hearing
of
some
one
else
who
is
and
be
sure
you
take
him
some
of
the
port
wine
as
the
doctor
ordered
and
tozer
paid
that
dear
for
i
do
care
for
it
not
a
bit
phoebe
sooner
have
it
from
the
grocer
at
two
shillings
a
bottle
that
what
i
always
been
used
to
when
i
did
take
a
glass
of
wine
now
and
again
but
i
dare
say
as
may
would
like
it
poor
gentleman
when
tozer
had
laid
her
head
all
nodding
with
white
muslin
frills
edged
with
cotton
lace
upon
her
pillow
phoebe
noiseless
in
her
soft
merino
gown
went
back
accompanied
by
martha
to
the
parsonage
where
ursula
careworn
face
lighted
a
little
at
sight
of
her
ursula
had
left
her
father
for
the
moment
in
betsy
care
to
get
something
that
was
wanted
and
she
stole
into
the
on
hearing
of
her
arrival
and
talked
a
little
in
a
whisper
though
the
sick
man
was
on
the
upper
floor
and
could
not
possibly
have
heard
anything
northcote
was
still
there
sitting
with
reginald
too
anxious
and
excited
to
go
away
and
they
all
conversed
in
whispers
the
three
of
them
talking
together
for
the
benefit
of
the
not
paralysis
at
least
he
does
not
think
so
a
great
mental
shock
but
we
ca
tell
a
bit
what
it
was
coming
when
he
was
dreadfully
tired
and
not
able
to
bear
it
they
all
spoke
together
each
of
them
saying
a
few
words
and
kept
close
together
in
the
centre
of
the
room
a
curious
little
group
overawed
and
subdued
by
the
sudden
change
and
strange
calamity
dropt
into
their
midst
phoebe
seemed
to
bring
them
new
life
and
hope
if
it
is
going
to
be
an
illness
she
said
you
gentlemen
had
better
go
home
and
go
to
bed
to
be
able
to
help
us
when
we
want
help
anyhow
what
good
can
they
do
ursula
they
had
much
better
go
to
bed
ursula
looked
at
them
with
a
certain
regret
though
they
could
not
do
much
good
it
was
a
relief
to
come
and
whisper
a
few
words
to
them
now
and
then
giving
them
news
of
the
patient
but
phoebe
was
right
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
against
her
decision
the
two
young
women
and
the
faithful
betsy
were
enough
and
indeed
more
than
enough
to
watch
over
may
chapter
xli
a
morning
work
go
and
lie
down
for
an
hour
whispered
phoebe
i
am
not
sleepy
at
all
i
have
sat
up
before
and
never
felt
it
you
never
did
i
can
see
it
in
your
poor
little
white
face
and
besides
i
am
steadier
because
i
am
not
so
anxious
now
go
ursula
if
you
are
really
fond
of
me
as
you
say
oh
phoebe
if
you
think
he
is
a
little
better
oh
how
horrible
it
is
to
be
sleepy
as
if
you
were
all
body
and
had
no
heart
at
all
you
have
plenty
of
heart
but
you
have
never
been
used
to
this
nursing
leave
your
door
open
so
that
i
may
call
you
in
a
moment
i
have
sat
up
often
now
go
to
please
me
said
phoebe
she
had
another
object
than
mere
rest
to
her
friend
who
at
last
very
much
ashamed
and
crying
softly
yet
so
weary
that
nothing
on
this
earth
seemed
so
desirable
to
her
as
sleep
crept
to
her
room
and
lay
down
there
as
the
pale
morning
began
to
dawn
betsy
slept
heavily
in
an
outside
the
door
of
the
she
was
there
at
hand
in
case
anything
was
wanted
but
she
was
happily
unconscious
where
she
was
sleeping
the
sleep
of
hard
work
and
a
mind
undisturbed
phoebe
had
seen
that
the
patient
was
stirring
out
of
the
dull
doze
in
which
his
faculties
had
been
entirely
stilled
and
stupefied
he
was
rousing
to
uneasiness
if
not
to
full
consciousness
two
or
three
times
he
made
a
convulsive
movement
as
if
to
raise
himself
once
his
eyes
which
were
half
open
seemed
to
turn
upon
her
with
a
vague
glimmer
of
meaning
how
strangely
she
felt
towards
him
as
she
sat
there
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
sole
guardian
sole
confidant
of
this
erring
and
miserable
man
the
thought
ran
through
her
with
a
strange
thrill
he
was
nothing
to
her
and
yet
he
was
absolutely
in
her
power
and
in
all
heaven
and
earth
there
seemed
no
one
who
was
capable
of
protecting
him
or
cared
to
do
so
except
herself
only
she
sat
looking
at
him
with
a
great
pity
in
her
mind
determined
to
be
his
true
protector
to
deliver
him
from
what
he
himself
had
done
she
had
not
realized
at
first
what
it
was
he
had
done
and
indeed
it
was
only
now
that
its
full
enormity
or
rather
its
full
consequences
which
were
the
things
that
affected
her
most
urgently
made
themselves
apparent
to
her
generalizations
are
unsafe
things
and
whether
it
was
because
she
was
a
woman
that
phoebe
passing
over
the
crime
fixed
her
thoughts
upon
the
punishment
i
do
not
venture
to
say
but
she
did
so
after
all
a
few
lines
of
writing
on
a
bit
of
paper
is
not
a
crime
which
affects
the
imagination
of
the
inexperienced
had
it
been
a
malicious
slander
phoebe
would
have
realized
the
sin
of
it
much
more
clearly
but
the
copy
of
her
grandfather
signature
did
not
wound
her
moral
sense
in
the
same
way
though
it
was
a
much
more
serious
offence
that
may
could
have
intended
to
rob
him
of
the
money
appeared
impossible
to
her
and
no
doubt
the
borrowing
of
the
signature
was
wrong
very
wrong
yes
of
course
it
was
horribly
fatally
wrong
but
still
it
did
not
set
her
imagination
aglow
with
indignant
horror
as
smaller
affairs
might
have
done
but
the
consequences
disgrace
ruin
the
loss
of
his
position
the
shame
of
his
profession
moral
death
indeed
almost
as
frightful
as
if
he
had
been
hanged
for
murder
she
shivered
as
she
sat
by
him
veiled
by
the
curtain
and
thought
of
her
grandfather
vindictive
fierceness
only
she
stood
between
him
and
destruction
and
phoebe
felt
that
it
was
by
no
legitimate
means
that
she
was
doing
so
not
by
her
influence
over
her
grandfather
as
she
had
hoped
but
only
by
an
unjustifiable
expedient
which
in
itself
was
a
kind
of
crime
this
however
brought
a
slight
smile
on
her
face
she
took
out
her
little
purse
from
her
pocket
and
looked
at
the
bit
of
paper
carefully
folded
in
it
the
faint
perfume
of
the
russia
leather
had
already
communicated
itself
to
the
document
which
had
not
been
so
pleasant
in
tozer
hands
as
she
looked
at
it
lying
peacefully
on
her
lap
her
attention
was
suddenly
called
by
the
patient
who
sat
upright
and
looked
furtively
about
him
with
his
hand
upon
the
coverings
ready
to
throw
them
off
his
ghastly
white
face
peered
at
her
from
behind
the
curtain
with
wild
eagerness
then
relaxed
when
he
met
her
eye
into
a
kind
of
idiot
smile
a
painful
attempt
to
divert
suspicion
and
he
fell
back
again
with
a
groan
the
trance
that
had
stupefied
him
was
over
he
had
recovered
some
kind
of
consciousness
how
much
or
how
little
she
could
not
tell
his
mind
now
seemed
to
be
set
upon
hiding
himself
drawing
his
coverings
over
him
and
concealing
himself
with
the
curtain
at
which
he
grasped
with
an
excess
of
force
which
neutralized
itself
may
said
phoebe
softly
may
do
you
know
me
she
could
not
tell
what
answer
he
made
or
if
he
made
any
answer
he
crouched
down
under
the
pulling
them
over
his
face
trying
to
hide
himself
from
her
from
which
she
divined
that
he
did
recognize
her
confused
though
his
faculties
were
then
a
hoarse
murmuring
sound
seemed
to
come
out
of
the
pillow
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
make
out
what
it
was
where
am
i
he
said
with
the
lightning
speed
of
sympathy
and
pity
phoebe
divined
what
his
terror
was
she
said
almost
whispering
at
home
in
your
own
bed
at
home
and
safe
oh
do
you
know
me
i
am
phoebe
then
after
a
pause
tozer
granddaughter
do
you
know
me
now
the
strange
scared
spectre
shrank
under
his
covering
till
she
could
see
no
more
of
him
except
two
wild
eyes
full
of
terror
which
was
almost
madness
listen
she
said
eagerly
try
to
understand
oh
may
try
to
understand
i
know
about
it
i
know
everything
and
you
are
safe
quite
safe
you
need
not
have
any
fear
he
did
not
follow
what
she
said
phoebe
perceived
with
pain
and
terror
even
the
impression
made
by
the
first
sight
of
her
seemed
to
fade
from
his
mind
his
grasp
relaxed
upon
the
curtains
and
coverlet
and
then
the
hoarse
murmuring
was
resumed
straining
all
her
ears
she
made
out
that
he
was
not
speaking
to
her
or
any
one
but
moaned
to
himself
saying
the
same
words
over
and
over
again
it
took
her
a
long
time
to
make
out
even
what
these
words
were
when
at
last
she
did
make
them
out
they
filled
the
girl
with
an
alarm
beyond
words
it
used
to
be
hanging
he
said
hard
labour
can
i
bear
hard
labour
and
the
children
the
children
hard
labour
for
life
hanging
was
soon
over
the
children
i
can
not
bear
it
i
never
was
put
to
hard
labour
in
all
my
life
phoebe
was
too
sick
at
heart
to
listen
to
more
she
drew
a
little
apart
but
near
enough
to
be
seen
by
him
if
he
chose
to
spring
up
to
fling
himself
from
the
window
as
she
had
heard
of
men
doing
in
delirium
who
could
restrain
him
not
she
a
slight
girl
nor
betsy
even
if
betsy
could
be
roused
to
the
danger
she
did
not
know
how
long
the
vigil
which
followed
lasted
but
it
seemed
like
years
to
her
and
when
at
last
she
was
relieved
by
the
joyful
sound
of
reginald
voice
and
footstep
coming
up
the
stairs
she
felt
disposed
to
run
to
the
glass
at
once
and
look
if
her
hair
had
grown
white
or
her
countenance
permanently
changed
with
the
terror
reginald
for
his
part
thought
of
his
father
in
the
second
place
only
as
children
are
apt
to
do
he
came
up
to
her
first
and
with
a
thrill
in
his
voice
of
surprise
and
emotion
addressed
her
hastily
by
her
name
phoebe
is
it
who
are
watching
you
darling
hush
i
sent
ursula
to
bed
she
was
so
tired
do
leave
him
i
am
frightened
cried
phoebe
he
is
wandering
in
his
mind
oh
do
leave
him
mr
may
i
will
do
exactly
as
you
tell
me
said
reginald
in
a
confused
transport
of
feeling
the
very
anxiety
in
his
mind
helping
to
destroy
his
he
stooped
down
and
kissed
her
hands
before
she
could
divine
what
he
was
about
to
do
only
you
or
an
angel
would
have
done
it
he
cried
with
a
tremulous
voice
was
it
not
natural
that
he
should
think
that
some
thought
of
him
had
made
phoebe
so
careful
of
his
father
his
heart
was
swelling
too
full
to
hold
with
a
sudden
joy
which
expanded
the
pain
and
made
that
greater
too
oh
what
does
it
matter
about
me
may
think
what
i
am
saying
do
leave
him
for
a
moment
he
might
throw
himself
out
of
the
window
he
might
do
some
harm
to
himself
ah
again
said
phoebe
trembling
but
this
time
it
was
only
a
convulsive
start
nothing
more
the
patient
dropped
down
again
softly
upon
his
pillows
and
relapsed
into
his
doze
if
doze
it
could
be
called
in
which
his
faculties
were
but
and
his
open
eyes
contradicted
all
the
appearances
of
natural
sleep
when
she
was
relieved
from
the
sick
room
and
now
she
had
a
double
motive
in
getting
away
phoebe
stole
softly
into
the
faded
little
place
where
ursula
lay
still
fast
asleep
though
fully
dressed
and
bathed
her
face
and
strained
eyes
i
wonder
if
my
hair
is
grey
underneath
she
said
to
herself
i
wonder
nothing
has
happened
to
me
but
a
great
deal
had
happened
to
her
such
a
night
is
rarely
encountered
by
so
young
a
creature
or
such
an
alarming
charge
undertaken
and
sudden
hot
kisses
upon
little
cold
agitated
hands
worn
by
fatigue
to
nervous
perception
of
every
touch
are
very
exciting
and
strange
to
a
girl
they
had
given
her
a
kind
of
electric
shock
she
was
not
in
love
with
reginald
and
therefore
she
felt
it
all
the
more
and
her
heart
was
still
throbbing
with
the
suddenness
and
excitement
of
the
incident
and
after
she
had
made
an
effort
to
get
over
this
there
remained
upon
her
mind
the
disturbing
burden
of
a
knowledge
which
no
one
shared
and
a
responsibility
which
was
very
heavy
and
terrible
and
too
tremendous
for
her
slight
shoulders
after
she
had
made
that
hasty
toilette
she
sat
down
for
a
moment
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
on
which
ursula
lay
sleeping
unconscious
of
all
those
mysteries
and
tried
to
think
it
is
not
an
easy
process
at
any
time
but
after
a
long
night
watching
terror
and
agitation
it
seemed
more
impossible
to
phoebe
than
it
had
ever
done
before
and
she
had
so
much
occasion
for
thought
so
much
need
of
the
power
of
judging
clearly
what
was
she
to
do
not
or
next
week
but
now
she
had
taken
the
responsibility
of
the
whole
upon
herself
by
the
sudden
step
she
had
taken
last
night
but
bold
as
she
had
been
phoebe
was
ignorant
she
did
not
know
whether
her
theft
of
the
bill
would
really
stop
the
whole
proceedings
as
had
seemed
so
certain
last
night
and
what
if
she
was
found
out
and
compelled
to
return
it
and
all
her
labour
lost
a
panic
took
possession
of
her
as
she
sat
there
at
the
foot
of
ursula
bed
and
tried
to
think
but
what
is
the
use
of
trying
to
think
the
more
you
have
need
of
them
the
more
all
mental
processes
fail
you
phoebe
could
no
more
think
than
she
could
fly
she
sat
down
very
seriously
and
she
rose
up
in
despair
and
thought
being
no
longer
among
her
possibilities
resolved
to
do
something
at
once
without
further
delay
which
would
be
a
consolation
to
herself
at
least
how
wonderful
it
was
to
go
out
in
the
fresh
early
morning
and
see
the
people
moving
about
their
work
going
up
and
down
with
indifferent
faces
quite
unconcerned
about
the
day
and
all
it
might
bring
forth
she
went
up
grange
lane
with
a
curious
uncertainty
as
to
what
she
should
do
next
feeling
her
own
extraordinary
independence
more
than
anything
else
phoebe
felt
like
a
man
who
has
been
out
all
night
who
has
his
own
future
all
in
his
hands
nobody
having
any
right
to
explanation
or
information
about
what
he
may
choose
to
do
or
to
expect
from
him
anything
beyond
what
he
himself
may
please
to
give
very
few
people
are
in
this
absolutely
free
position
but
this
was
how
phoebe
represented
it
to
herself
having
like
all
other
girls
unbounded
belief
in
the
independence
and
freedom
possessed
by
men
many
times
in
her
life
she
had
regarded
with
envy
this
independence
which
with
a
sigh
she
had
felt
to
be
impossible
but
now
that
she
had
it
phoebe
did
not
like
it
what
she
would
have
given
to
have
gone
to
some
one
almost
any
one
and
told
her
dilemma
and
put
the
burden
a
little
off
her
shoulders
but
she
durst
not
say
a
word
to
any
one
very
anxious
and
she
went
up
grange
lane
home
she
did
not
know
perhaps
she
would
have
thought
of
something
before
she
reached
the
gate
of
no
and
accordingly
when
she
had
lifted
her
hand
to
ring
the
bell
and
made
a
step
aside
to
enter
an
inspiration
came
to
phoebe
she
turned
away
from
the
door
and
went
on
up
into
the
town
cautiously
drawing
her
veil
over
her
face
for
already
the
apprentices
were
taking
down
the
shutters
from
her
shop
and
she
might
be
seen
cotsdean
shop
was
late
of
opening
that
morning
and
its
master
was
very
restless
and
unhappy
he
had
heard
nothing
more
about
the
bill
but
a
conviction
of
something
wrong
had
crept
into
his
mind
it
was
an
altogether
different
sensation
from
the
anxiety
he
had
hitherto
felt
this
was
no
anxiety
to
speak
of
but
a
dull
pain
and
aching
conviction
that
all
was
not
right
when
he
saw
the
young
lady
entering
the
shop
cotsdean
spirits
rose
a
little
for
a
new
customer
was
pleasant
and
though
he
thought
he
had
seen
her
he
did
not
know
who
she
was
she
was
pleasant
to
look
upon
and
it
was
not
often
that
any
one
came
so
early
he
came
forward
with
anxious
politeness
the
boy
who
was
always
late
and
a
useless
creature
more
expense
than
he
was
worth
had
not
appeared
and
therefore
cotsdean
was
alone
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
please
said
phoebe
will
you
mind
if
i
speak
very
plainly
without
any
ceremony
cotsdean
i
am
granddaughter
and
live
with
him
at
no
in
the
lane
i
dare
say
you
have
often
seen
me
with
miss
may
yes
yes
miss
certainly
he
said
with
a
thrill
of
alarm
and
excitement
running
through
him
he
felt
his
knees
knock
together
under
cover
of
the
counter
and
yet
he
did
not
know
what
he
feared
will
you
please
tell
me
frankly
in
confidence
about
the
bill
which
was
brought
to
my
grandfather
yesterday
said
phoebe
bringing
out
the
question
with
a
rush
whether
she
was
doing
wrong
whether
she
might
bring
insult
upon
herself
whether
it
was
an
interference
unwarrantable
and
unjustifiable
she
could
not
tell
she
was
in
as
great
a
fright
as
cotsdean
and
more
anxious
still
than
he
was
but
fortunately
her
agitation
did
not
show
what
am
i
to
tell
you
about
it
miss
said
the
man
terrified
is
it
tozer
as
has
sent
you
lord
help
me
i
know
as
he
can
sell
me
up
if
he
has
a
mind
but
he
knows
it
ai
me
do
speak
so
loud
said
phoebe
trembling
too
nobody
must
hear
and
remember
you
are
never
never
to
talk
of
this
to
any
one
else
but
tell
me
plainly
that
there
may
be
no
mistake
is
it
mr
may
miss
tozer
said
cotsdean
who
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
if
that
your
name
i
do
want
to
say
a
word
against
my
clergyman
stood
by
me
many
a
day
as
i
wanted
him
and
wanted
him
bad
but
as
i
a
living
man
that
money
was
never
for
me
and
now
he
and
left
me
in
the
lurch
and
if
your
grandfather
likes
he
can
sell
me
up
and
that
the
truth
i
got
seven
children
said
the
poor
man
with
a
sob
breaking
his
voice
and
a
missus
and
nothing
as
is
in
the
business
not
a
penny
except
a
pound
or
two
in
a
savings
bank
as
would
never
count
and
i
do
deny
as
he
could
sell
me
up
but
oh
miss
he
knows
very
well
it
ai
for
me
cotsdean
said
phoebe
impressively
you
do
know
i
suppose
that
may
had
a
fit
when
he
received
your
note
last
night
lord
help
us
oh
god
forgive
me
i
done
him
wrong
poor
gentleman
if
that
true
it
is
quite
true
he
is
very
very
ill
he
ca
give
you
any
advice
or
assist
you
in
any
way
should
grandpapa
be
unkind
he
could
not
even
understand
if
you
told
him
what
has
happened
once
more
cotsdean
knees
knocked
against
each
other
in
the
shadow
of
the
counter
his
very
lips
trembled
as
he
stood
regarding
his
strange
visitor
with
scared
and
wondering
eyes
now
listen
please
said
phoebe
earnestly
if
any
one
comes
to
you
about
the
bill
do
say
anything
about
say
you
got
it
in
the
way
of
business
say
anything
you
please
but
do
mention
if
you
will
promise
me
this
i
will
see
that
you
do
come
to
any
harm
yes
i
will
you
may
say
i
am
not
the
sort
of
person
to
know
about
business
and
it
is
quite
true
but
whoever
comes
to
you
remember
this
if
you
do
mention
may
i
will
see
you
safely
through
it
do
you
understand
phoebe
leant
across
the
counter
in
her
earnestness
she
was
not
the
kind
of
person
to
talk
about
bills
or
to
be
a
satisfactory
security
for
a
man
in
business
but
cotsdean
was
a
poor
man
and
he
was
ready
to
catch
at
a
straw
in
the
turbid
ocean
of
debt
and
poverty
which
seemed
closing
round
him
he
gave
the
required
promise
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
then
phoebe
returned
down
the
street
her
fatigue
began
to
tell
upon
her
but
she
knew
that
she
dared
not
give
in
or
allow
that
she
was
fatigued
however
heavy
with
sleep
her
eyes
might
be
she
must
keep
awake
and
watchful
nothing
if
she
could
help
it
must
so
much
as
turn
the
attention
of
the
world
in
may
direction
by
this
time
she
was
much
too
deeply
interested
to
ask
herself
why
she
should
do
so
much
for
may
he
was
her
charge
her
burden
as
helpless
in
her
hands
as
a
child
and
nobody
but
herself
knew
anything
about
it
it
was
characteristic
of
phoebe
nature
that
she
had
no
doubt
as
to
being
perfectly
right
in
the
matter
no
qualm
lest
she
should
be
making
a
mistake
she
felt
the
weight
upon
her
of
the
great
thing
she
had
undertaken
to
do
with
a
certain
sense
of
the
solemnity
of
the
position
and
of
its
difficulties
but
she
was
not
afraid
that
she
was
going
wrong
or
suffering
her
fancy
to
stray
further
than
the
facts
justified
neither
was
she
troubled
by
any
idea
of
going
beyond
her
sphere
by
interfering
thus
energetically
in
her
friend
affairs
phoebe
did
not
easily
take
any
such
idea
into
her
head
it
seemed
natural
to
her
to
do
whatever
might
be
wanted
and
to
act
upon
her
own
responsibility
her
reached
the
heroic
point
she
knew
that
she
was
right
and
she
knew
moreover
that
in
this
whole
matter
she
alone
was
right
therefore
the
necessity
of
keeping
up
of
keeping
alert
and
vigilant
of
holding
in
her
hand
the
threads
of
all
these
varied
complications
was
not
disagreeable
to
her
though
she
fully
felt
its
importance
nay
almost
exaggerated
it
in
her
own
mind
if
that
could
be
she
felt
the
dangerous
character
of
the
circumstances
around
her
and
her
heart
was
sore
with
pity
for
the
culprit
or
as
she
called
him
to
herself
the
chief
sufferer
and
yet
all
the
same
phoebe
felt
a
certain
sense
of
satisfaction
in
the
great
role
she
herself
was
playing
she
felt
equal
to
it
though
she
scarcely
knew
what
was
the
nest
step
she
ought
to
take
she
was
walking
slowly
full
of
thought
to
tozer
door
pondering
upon
this
when
the
sound
of
rapid
wheels
behind
roused
her
attention
and
looking
up
surprised
she
suddenly
saw
leaping
out
of
a
the
imposing
figure
of
clarence
copperhead
of
whom
she
had
not
been
thinking
at
all
he
came
down
with
a
heavy
leap
leaving
the
light
carriage
swinging
and
quivering
behind
him
with
the
shock
of
his
withdrawal
miss
phoebe
he
said
breathless
here
luck
i
came
over
to
see
you
and
you
are
the
first
person
i
set
eyes
on
he
was
rather
heavy
to
make
such
a
jump
and
it
took
away
his
breath
to
see
me
she
said
laughing
though
her
heart
began
to
stir
that
is
very
odd
i
thought
you
must
have
come
to
see
poor
may
who
is
so
you
know
may
be
hanged
said
the
young
man
i
mean
never
mind
i
do
mean
him
any
harm
though
by
jove
if
you
make
such
a
pet
of
him
i
know
what
i
shall
think
miss
phoebe
i
come
over
as
you
may
see
chiefly
to
see
you
and
to
try
a
horse
as
well
he
added
which
the
governor
has
just
bought
he
a
very
good
to
go
and
pleased
the
governor
would
be
if
he
knew
the
use
i
had
put
him
to
he
concluded
with
a
phoebe
knew
as
well
as
he
did
what
that
use
was
he
had
brought
his
father
horse
out
for
the
first
time
to
carry
him
here
to
propose
to
her
in
spite
of
his
father
this
was
the
delicate
meaning
which
it
amused
him
to
think
of
she
understood
it
all
and
it
brought
a
glow
of
colour
to
her
face
but
it
did
not
steel
her
heart
against
him
she
knew
her
clarence
and
that
his
standard
of
fine
feeling
and
mental
elevation
was
not
high
look
here
he
said
i
wish
i
could
speak
to
you
miss
phoebe
somewhere
better
than
in
the
street
yes
in
the
garden
that
will
do
it
ai
much
of
a
place
either
to
make
a
proposal
in
for
that
what
i
come
to
do
but
you
do
want
me
to
go
down
on
my
knees
or
make
a
fuss
eh
i
got
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
be
here
first
thing
and
see
you
i
never
had
a
great
deal
to
say
for
myself
said
clarence
you
wo
expect
me
to
make
you
fine
speeches
but
i
fond
of
you
awfully
fond
of
you
phoebe
that
the
truth
you
suit
me
down
to
the
ground
music
and
everything
there
no
girl
i
ever
met
that
has
taken
such
a
hold
upon
me
as
you
phoebe
heard
him
very
quietly
but
her
heart
beat
loud
she
stood
on
the
gravel
between
the
where
the
primroses
were
beginning
to
wither
and
glanced
over
her
life
of
the
past
and
that
of
the
future
which
were
divided
by
this
moment
like
the
two
beds
of
flowers
one
homely
not
very
distinguished
simple
enough
the
other
exalted
by
wealth
to
something
quite
above
mediocrity
her
heart
swelled
full
as
it
was
with
so
many
emotions
of
a
totally
different
kind
she
had
gained
a
great
prize
though
it
might
not
be
very
much
to
look
at
more
or
less
she
was
conscious
this
golden
apple
had
been
hanging
before
her
eyes
for
years
and
now
it
had
dropped
into
her
hand
a
gentle
glow
of
contentment
diffused
itself
all
over
her
not
transport
indeed
but
satisfaction
which
was
better
copperhead
she
said
softly
no
hang
it
all
call
me
clarence
phoebe
if
you
going
to
have
me
he
cried
putting
out
his
big
hands
grandmamma
is
looking
at
us
from
the
window
she
said
hurriedly
withdrawing
a
little
from
him
well
and
what
does
that
matter
the
old
lady
wo
say
a
word
depend
upon
it
when
she
knows
look
here
phoebe
i
have
an
answer
yes
or
no
have
you
got
your
father
consent
clarence
ah
it
is
yes
then
i
thought
it
would
be
yes
he
cried
seizing
her
in
his
arms
as
for
the
governor
added
clarence
after
an
interval
snapping
his
fingers
i
do
care
for
the
governor
when
set
my
mind
on
a
thing
it
ai
the
governor
or
twenty
governors
that
will
stop
me
chapter
xlii
a
great
mental
shock
have
you
any
notion
what
was
the
cause
none
said
reginald
oh
no
none
at
all
said
ursula
they
were
all
three
standing
at
the
door
of
the
in
which
already
a
great
transformation
had
taken
place
the
doctor
had
sent
a
nurse
to
attend
upon
the
patient
he
had
told
them
that
their
father
was
attacked
by
some
mysterious
affection
of
the
brain
and
that
none
of
them
were
equal
to
the
responsibility
of
nursing
him
his
children
thus
banished
had
set
the
door
ajar
and
were
congregated
round
it
watching
what
went
on
within
they
did
not
know
what
to
do
it
was
northcote
who
was
asking
these
questions
it
was
he
who
was
most
active
among
them
the
others
stood
wholly
ignorant
not
knowing
what
to
do
i
do
think
papa
is
ill
at
all
said
janey
look
how
he
glares
about
him
just
as
i
seen
him
do
when
he
was
writing
a
sermon
ready
to
pounce
upon
any
one
that
made
a
noise
he
is
watching
that
woman
why
should
he
lie
in
bed
like
that
and
be
taken
care
of
when
he
is
just
as
well
as
i
am
you
have
made
a
mistake
all
the
rest
of
you
i
would
go
and
speak
to
him
and
tell
him
to
get
up
and
not
make
all
this
fuss
if
it
was
me
oh
janey
hold
your
tongue
said
ursula
but
she
too
looked
at
the
bed
and
then
turned
wistful
inquiring
eyes
to
northcote
as
for
reginald
he
stood
uncertain
bewildered
all
the
colour
gone
out
of
his
face
and
all
the
energy
out
of
his
heart
he
knew
nothing
of
his
father
affairs
or
of
anything
that
might
disturb
his
mind
his
mind
all
that
his
son
knew
of
this
was
that
whatsoever
things
disturbed
other
minds
his
father
had
always
contemptuously
scouted
all
such
nonsense
take
some
medicine
may
had
been
in
the
habit
of
saying
mind
you
mean
digestion
was
it
nothing
more
than
some
complicated
indigestion
that
affected
him
now
is
it
anything
about
money
said
northcote
they
all
turned
and
looked
at
him
the
idea
entered
their
minds
for
the
first
time
yes
very
likely
it
was
money
we
have
always
been
poor
said
ursula
wistfully
northcote
took
her
hand
into
his
none
of
them
except
ursula
herself
paid
any
attention
to
this
involuntary
almost
unconscious
caress
and
even
to
her
it
seemed
a
thing
of
course
and
quite
natural
that
he
should
be
one
of
them
taking
his
share
in
all
that
was
going
on
i
am
not
poor
he
said
faltering
you
must
not
think
me
presumptuous
may
but
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
get
him
out
of
his
difficulties
if
he
is
in
difficulties
and
you
must
let
me
help
to
do
it
i
think
you
and
i
should
go
out
and
see
about
it
at
once
go
where
reginald
like
most
young
people
had
taken
little
notice
of
his
father
proceedings
so
long
as
things
went
smoothly
what
had
he
to
do
with
them
when
there
was
a
pressure
for
money
he
knew
he
should
hear
of
it
at
least
in
the
shape
of
reproaches
and
sneers
from
his
father
at
his
useless
life
and
the
expenses
of
the
family
but
even
these
reproaches
had
died
away
of
late
since
reginald
had
possessed
an
income
of
his
own
and
since
the
revenues
of
the
parsonage
had
been
increased
by
clarence
copperhead
reginald
was
more
helpless
than
a
stranger
he
did
not
know
where
to
turn
do
you
think
we
could
ask
him
i
am
almost
of
janey
opinion
i
do
think
he
is
so
ill
as
he
seems
and
then
they
all
paused
and
looked
again
into
the
room
the
nurse
was
moving
softly
about
putting
everything
in
order
and
may
watched
her
from
the
bed
with
the
keenest
attention
his
face
was
still
livid
and
ghastly
in
colour
but
his
eyes
had
never
been
so
full
of
eager
fire
in
all
the
experience
of
his
children
he
watched
the
woman
with
a
close
attention
which
was
appalling
sometimes
he
would
put
his
covering
half
aside
as
if
with
the
intention
of
making
a
spring
he
was
like
some
imprisoned
animal
seeing
a
possibility
of
escape
they
looked
at
him
and
then
at
each
other
with
a
miserable
helplessness
what
could
they
do
he
was
their
father
but
they
knew
nothing
about
him
and
just
because
he
was
their
father
they
were
more
slow
to
understand
more
dull
in
divining
his
secrets
than
if
he
had
been
a
stranger
when
there
came
at
last
a
suggestion
out
of
the
silence
it
was
northcote
who
spoke
i
do
see
how
you
can
leave
him
may
it
is
plain
he
wants
watching
i
will
go
if
you
will
let
me
if
ursula
will
say
i
may
said
the
young
man
with
a
little
break
in
his
voice
this
roused
them
all
to
another
question
quite
different
from
the
first
one
her
brother
and
sister
looked
at
ursula
one
with
a
keen
pang
of
involuntary
envy
the
other
with
a
sharp
thrill
of
pleasurable
excitement
oddly
enough
they
could
all
of
them
pass
by
their
father
and
leave
him
out
of
the
question
more
easily
with
less
strain
of
mind
than
strangers
could
ursula
for
her
part
did
not
say
anything
but
she
looked
at
her
lover
with
eyes
in
which
two
big
tears
were
standing
she
could
scarcely
see
him
through
those
oceans
of
moisture
bitter
and
salt
yet
softened
by
the
sense
of
trust
in
him
and
rest
upon
him
when
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
before
them
all
the
girl
did
not
blush
it
was
a
solemn
betrothal
sealed
by
pain
not
by
kisses
yes
go
she
said
to
him
in
words
which
were
half
sobs
and
which
he
understood
but
no
one
else
you
perceive
he
said
it
is
not
a
stranger
interfering
in
your
affairs
may
but
ursula
doing
her
natural
work
for
her
father
through
me
her
representative
god
bless
her
i
am
ursula
now
he
said
with
a
broken
laugh
of
joy
then
grew
suddenly
grave
again
you
trust
me
may
poor
reginald
heart
swelled
this
little
scene
so
calmly
transacted
under
his
eyes
would
it
ever
happen
for
him
or
anything
like
it
no
his
reason
told
him
and
yet
still
he
was
thinking
but
little
of
his
father
he
had
his
duty
too
and
this
happened
to
be
his
duty
but
no
warmer
impulse
was
in
the
poor
young
fellow
heart
and
thus
the
day
went
on
it
was
afternoon
already
and
soon
the
sky
began
to
darken
when
his
children
went
into
the
room
may
took
no
notice
of
them
not
that
he
did
not
know
them
but
because
his
whole
faculties
were
fixed
upon
that
woman
who
was
his
nurse
and
who
had
all
her
wits
about
her
and
meant
to
keep
him
there
and
to
carry
out
the
doctor
instructions
should
heaven
and
earth
melt
away
around
her
she
too
perceived
well
enough
how
he
was
watching
her
and
being
familiar
with
all
the
ways
as
she
thought
of
the
mentally
afflicted
concluded
in
her
mind
that
her
new
patient
was
further
gone
than
the
doctor
thought
i
hope
as
you
stay
within
call
sir
she
said
significantly
to
reginald
when
they
like
that
as
soon
as
they
breaks
out
they
as
strong
as
giants
but
i
hope
he
wo
break
out
not
reginald
withdrew
shivering
from
the
idea
thus
presented
to
him
he
stole
down
to
his
father
study
notwithstanding
the
warning
she
had
given
him
and
there
with
a
sick
heart
set
to
work
to
endeavour
to
understand
his
father
nay
more
than
that
to
try
to
find
him
out
the
young
man
felt
a
thrill
of
nervous
trembling
come
over
him
when
he
sat
down
in
his
father
chair
and
timidly
opened
some
of
the
drawers
may
was
in
many
respects
as
young
a
man
as
his
son
and
reginald
and
he
had
never
been
on
those
confidential
terms
which
bring
some
fathers
and
sons
so
very
close
together
he
felt
that
he
had
no
business
there
spying
upon
his
father
privacy
he
could
not
look
at
the
papers
which
lay
before
him
it
seemed
a
wrong
of
the
first
magnitude
wrought
treacherously
because
of
the
helplessness
of
the
creature
most
concerned
he
could
not
do
it
he
thrust
the
papers
back
again
into
the
drawer
in
point
of
fact
there
were
no
secrets
in
the
papers
nor
much
to
be
found
out
in
may
private
life
all
its
dark
side
might
be
inferred
from
without
being
revealed
in
the
little
book
which
lay
innocently
on
the
desk
and
which
reginald
looked
over
thinking
no
harm
in
it
there
were
two
or
three
entries
which
at
length
roused
his
curiosity
cotsdean
october
cotsdean
january
april
what
did
this
mean
reginald
remembered
to
have
seen
cotsdean
paying
furtive
visits
in
the
study
he
recollected
him
as
one
of
the
few
poor
people
for
whom
his
father
had
a
liking
but
what
could
there
be
between
them
he
was
puzzled
and
as
betsy
was
passing
the
open
door
at
the
time
called
her
in
the
evening
was
falling
quickly
the
day
had
changed
from
a
beautiful
bright
morning
to
a
rainy
gusty
afternoon
tearing
the
leaves
and
blossoms
from
the
trees
and
whirling
now
and
then
a
shower
of
snowy
petals
beautiful
but
snow
across
the
dark
window
beyond
that
the
firmament
was
dull
the
clouds
hung
low
and
the
day
was
gone
before
it
ought
when
betsy
came
in
she
closed
the
door
not
fastening
it
but
still
reginald
felt
shutting
him
out
too
much
from
the
to
which
he
might
be
called
at
any
moment
but
he
was
not
alarmed
by
this
though
he
remarked
it
he
questioned
betsy
closely
as
to
his
father
possible
connection
with
this
man
in
such
a
moment
confidential
interviews
are
the
rule
of
a
house
every
one
has
so
much
to
ask
so
much
to
say
in
reply
so
many
particulars
to
comment
upon
which
the
rest
may
have
forgotten
she
would
have
liked
to
enter
upon
the
whole
story
to
tell
how
the
master
was
took
and
how
she
herself
had
thought
him
looking
bad
when
he
came
in
but
even
to
talk
about
cotsdean
was
pleasant
i
told
miss
beecham
said
betsy
and
i
told
the
other
gentleman
northcote
as
was
asking
me
all
about
it
it
months
and
months
since
that
cotsdean
got
coming
here
years
i
may
say
and
whenever
he
came
master
looked
bad
if
you
believe
me
reginald
it
money
as
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
money
hush
what
was
that
i
thought
i
heard
something
upstairs
only
the
nurse
sir
as
is
having
her
tea
i
ready
to
take
my
oath
as
it
money
i
been
in
service
since
i
was
nine
years
old
said
betsy
i
had
a
deal
of
experience
of
gentlefolks
and
it
always
money
as
is
the
thing
as
sets
them
off
their
head
that
what
it
is
if
that
cotsdean
did
come
here
something
about
money
never
you
believe
me
no
more
cotsdean
a
poor
shopkeeper
what
could
he
have
to
do
with
my
affairs
reginald
was
not
speaking
to
the
woman
but
drearily
to
himself
if
this
was
the
only
clue
to
the
mystery
what
a
poor
clue
it
was
i
dunno
sir
said
betsy
it
ai
for
me
to
tell
but
one
thing
sure
of
lord
bless
us
what
that
reginald
rushed
to
the
door
nearly
knocking
her
down
as
he
pushed
her
aside
with
his
hand
when
they
got
outside
it
was
only
the
in
the
hall
that
had
fallen
something
having
been
torn
off
from
it
apparently
in
mad
haste
and
the
door
had
opened
and
shut
reginald
rushed
upstairs
where
the
nurse
was
sitting
quietly
at
her
tea
the
being
drawn
all
right
sir
he
in
a
nice
sleep
said
that
functionary
i
light
no
candles
not
to
disturb
him
poor
gentleman
reginald
tore
the
curtains
aside
then
turned
and
dashed
downstairs
and
out
into
the
windy
twilight
in
that
moment
of
stillness
and
darkness
the
patient
had
escaped
he
could
see
a
strange
figure
walking
rapidly
already
half
way
up
grange
lane
and
rushed
on
in
pursuit
without
taking
thought
of
anything
the
sick
man
had
seized
upon
a
long
coat
which
had
been
hanging
in
the
hall
and
which
reached
to
his
heels
reginald
flew
on
going
as
softly
as
he
could
not
to
alarm
him
where
could
he
be
going
utterly
unclothed
except
in
this
big
coat
was
it
simply
madness
that
had
seized
him
nothing
more
or
less
he
followed
with
his
heart
beating
loudly
there
seemed
nobody
about
no
one
to
whom
he
could
make
an
appeal
to
help
him
even
if
he
could
overtake
the
rapidly
progressing
fugitive
but
even
while
this
thought
crossed
his
mind
reginald
saw
another
figure
broad
and
tall
developing
in
the
distance
coming
towards
them
which
stopped
short
and
put
out
an
arm
to
stop
the
flight
even
that
moment
gave
him
the
advantage
and
brought
him
near
enough
to
make
out
that
it
was
copperhead
the
very
man
i
want
he
heard
him
say
with
his
loud
voice
putting
his
arm
within
that
of
may
who
resisted
but
not
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
as
reginald
came
up
breathless
and
placed
himself
on
his
father
other
side
the
darkness
prevented
any
revelation
of
the
strange
appearance
of
the
fugitive
and
copperhead
was
not
lively
of
perception
in
respect
to
people
unconnected
with
himself
you
too
he
cried
nodding
at
reginald
come
along
i
come
to
save
that
boy
of
mine
from
a
little
artful
come
both
of
you
the
sight
of
a
young
fellow
like
himself
will
shame
him
more
than
anything
and
you
may
you
the
very
man
i
want
not
there
not
there
for
god
sake
said
may
with
a
hoarse
cry
not
there
my
god
reginald
it
used
to
be
hanging
do
you
mean
to
give
me
up
hold
him
fast
reginald
whispered
in
desperation
hold
him
fast
it
is
madness
lord
bless
us
said
copperhead
but
he
was
a
man
who
was
proud
of
his
strength
and
not
given
to
timidity
he
held
his
captive
fast
by
the
arm
while
reginald
secured
him
on
the
other
side
why
what
this
may
rouse
yourself
up
do
give
in
man
no
you
ai
mad
not
a
bit
of
you
come
along
wait
here
at
tozer
for
me
while
i
do
my
business
and
then
i
look
after
come
on
there
was
a
violent
but
momentary
struggle
then
all
at
once
the
struggling
man
yielded
and
allowed
himself
to
be
dragged
within
the
was
it
because
an
ordinary
policeman
one
of
the
most
respectful
servants
of
the
law
who
would
have
saluted
may
with
the
utmost
reverence
was
just
then
coming
up
he
yielded
but
he
looked
at
his
son
with
a
wild
despair
which
made
reginald
almost
as
desperate
as
himself
in
maddening
ignorance
and
terror
ruin
ruin
he
murmured
hoarsely
worse
than
death
chapter
xliii
the
conflict
the
day
which
had
intervened
between
phoebe
morning
walk
and
this
darkling
flight
along
the
same
road
had
been
full
of
agitation
at
the
house
of
the
tozers
phoebe
who
would
willingly
have
spared
her
lover
anything
more
than
the
brief
intercourse
which
was
inevitable
with
her
relations
could
find
no
means
of
sending
him
away
without
breakfast
she
had
escaped
from
him
accordingly
weary
as
she
was
to
make
arrangements
for
such
a
meal
as
she
knew
him
even
in
his
most
sentimental
mood
to
love
a
thing
which
required
some
time
and
supervision
though
the
house
was
always
plentifully
provided
when
she
had
hastily
bathed
her
face
and
changed
her
dress
she
came
back
to
the
room
where
she
had
left
him
to
find
him
in
careless
conversation
with
tozer
who
only
from
the
excitement
of
last
night
but
much
overawed
by
a
visit
from
so
great
a
personage
had
managed
to
put
aside
the
matter
which
occupied
his
own
thoughts
in
order
to
carry
on
a
kind
of
worship
of
clarence
who
was
the
son
of
the
richest
man
he
had
ever
heard
of
and
consequently
appeared
to
the
retired
butterman
a
very
demigod
clarence
was
yawning
loudly
his
arms
raised
over
his
head
in
total
indifference
to
tozer
when
phoebe
came
into
the
room
and
the
old
man
seized
upon
the
occasion
of
her
entrance
to
perform
another
act
of
worship
ah
here
phoebe
at
last
copperhead
come
in
from
the
country
my
dear
and
he
going
to
make
us
proud
he
is
by
accepting
of
a
bit
of
breakfast
i
tell
him
it
a
wretched
poor
place
for
him
as
has
palaces
at
his
command
but
what
we
can
give
him
is
the
best
quality
that
i
answers
for
and
you
one
as
knows
how
things
should
be
even
if
we
ai
grand
ourselves
have
you
palaces
at
your
command
clarence
she
said
with
a
smile
notwithstanding
the
fatigue
of
the
night
the
fresh
air
and
her
ablutions
and
the
agitation
and
commotion
of
her
mind
made
phoebe
almost
more
animated
and
brilliant
than
usual
her
eyes
shone
with
the
anxiety
and
excitement
of
the
crisis
and
a
little
too
with
the
glory
and
delight
of
success
for
though
clarence
copperhead
was
not
very
much
to
brag
of
in
his
own
person
he
still
had
been
the
object
before
her
for
some
time
back
and
she
had
got
him
and
yet
phoebe
was
not
mercenary
though
she
was
not
in
love
with
her
heavy
lover
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
she
went
towards
him
now
and
stood
near
him
looking
at
him
with
a
smile
he
was
a
big
strong
fellow
which
is
a
thing
most
women
esteem
and
he
was
not
without
good
looks
and
he
would
be
rich
and
might
be
thrust
into
a
position
which
would
produce
both
honour
and
advantage
and
lastly
he
was
her
own
which
gives
even
the
most
indifferent
article
a
certain
value
in
some
people
eyes
palaces
i
do
know
but
nice
enough
houses
and
you
know
you
like
a
nice
house
miss
phoebe
here
i
have
said
a
word
to
the
old
gentleman
tell
him
i
ai
come
all
this
way
for
nothing
always
got
the
right
words
at
your
fingers
end
tell
him
and
let
get
it
over
i
think
i
could
eat
some
breakfast
i
can
tell
you
after
that
drive
grandpapa
said
phoebe
slightly
tremulous
copperhead
wishes
me
to
tell
you
that
copperhead
wishes
you
to
know
why
bless
us
cried
clarence
with
a
laugh
here
is
a
beating
about
the
bush
she
has
got
her
master
old
gentleman
and
that
is
what
she
never
had
before
look
here
i
going
to
marry
phoebe
that
plain
english
without
any
phrases
and
i
do
know
what
you
could
say
to
better
it
is
breakfast
ready
i
earned
it
for
my
part
going
to
marry
phoebe
tozer
gasped
he
had
heard
from
his
wife
that
such
a
glory
was
possible
but
now
when
it
burst
upon
him
the
dazzling
delight
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
it
thrust
the
forgery
and
everything
out
of
his
head
and
took
even
the
power
of
speech
from
him
he
got
up
and
gazed
at
the
young
people
one
after
the
other
rubbing
his
hands
with
a
broad
grin
upon
his
face
then
he
burst
forth
all
at
once
in
congratulation
god
bless
you
sir
god
bless
you
both
it
an
honour
as
i
never
looked
for
rising
in
the
world
was
never
no
thought
of
mine
doing
your
duty
and
trusting
to
the
lord
is
what
i
always
stood
by
and
been
rewarded
but
she
a
good
girl
copperhead
you
never
regret
it
sir
she
that
good
and
that
sensible
as
i
do
know
how
to
do
without
her
she
do
you
credit
however
grand
you
may
make
her
and
if
it
any
comfort
to
you
as
she
connected
with
them
as
knows
how
to
appreciate
a
gentleman
said
tozer
breaking
down
in
his
enthusiasm
his
voice
sinking
into
a
whisper
in
the
fulness
of
his
heart
grandpapa
said
phoebe
feeling
sharply
pricked
in
her
pride
with
a
momentary
humiliation
there
are
other
things
to
be
thought
of
and
she
gave
him
a
look
of
reproach
which
tozer
did
not
understand
but
which
clarence
did
vaguely
clarence
for
his
part
liked
the
homage
and
was
by
no
means
unwilling
that
everybody
should
perceive
his
condescension
and
what
great
luck
it
was
for
phoebe
to
have
secured
him
he
laughed
pleased
to
wave
his
banner
of
triumph
over
her
notwithstanding
that
he
loved
her
he
very
fond
of
her
that
was
true
but
still
her
good
fortune
in
catching
him
was
for
the
moment
the
thing
most
in
his
thoughts
well
old
gentleman
he
said
you
ai
far
wrong
there
she
a
clever
one
we
shall
have
a
bad
time
of
it
with
the
governor
at
first
for
of
course
when
there
no
money
and
no
connections
a
man
like
the
governor
that
has
made
himself
ai
likely
to
be
too
well
pleased
as
for
money
copperhead
sir
said
tozer
with
modest
pride
i
do
see
as
there
anything
to
be
said
against
phoebe
on
that
point
her
mother
before
her
had
a
pretty
bit
of
money
though
i
say
it
as
should
ah
yes
yes
said
clarence
to
be
sure
but
a
little
bit
of
coin
like
that
do
count
with
us
the
governor
deals
in
hundreds
of
thousands
he
do
think
much
of
your
little
bits
of
fortunes
but
i
do
mind
she
suits
me
down
to
the
ground
does
phoebe
and
i
give
that
for
the
governor
cried
the
young
man
valiantly
as
for
phoebe
herself
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
any
one
more
entirely
put
out
of
her
place
and
out
of
all
the
comfort
and
satisfaction
in
her
own
initiative
which
she
generally
possessed
than
this
young
woman
was
while
these
two
men
talked
over
her
so
calmly
it
is
doubtful
whether
she
had
ever
been
so
set
aside
out
of
her
proper
position
in
her
life
and
her
nerves
were
overstrained
and
her
bodily
strength
worn
out
which
added
to
the
sense
of
downfall
with
almost
a
touch
of
anger
in
her
tone
she
who
was
never
out
of
temper
interrupted
this
talk
i
think
breakfast
is
ready
grandpapa
clarence
copperhead
wants
some
refreshment
after
his
exertions
and
in
preparation
for
the
exertions
to
come
for
i
suppose
your
papa
is
very
likely
to
follow
you
to
carlingford
she
added
with
a
low
laugh
turning
to
her
lover
i
know
copperhead
very
well
and
i
should
not
like
my
first
meeting
with
him
after
i
had
thwarted
all
his
views
phoebe
you
do
mean
to
desert
me
by
jove
i
face
him
and
twenty
like
him
if
you
only
stand
by
me
he
cried
which
was
a
speech
that
made
amends
she
suffered
him
to
lead
her
into
breakfast
less
formally
than
is
the
ordinary
fashion
and
his
hand
on
her
trim
waist
did
not
displease
the
girl
no
she
understood
him
knew
that
he
was
no
great
things
but
yet
he
was
hers
and
she
had
always
meant
him
to
be
hers
and
phoebe
was
ready
to
maintain
his
cause
in
the
face
of
all
the
world
the
breakfast
was
to
clarence
taste
and
so
was
the
company
even
old
tozer
who
sat
with
his
mouth
agape
in
admiration
of
the
young
potentate
while
he
recounted
his
many
grandeurs
clarence
gave
a
great
deal
of
information
as
to
prices
he
had
paid
for
various
things
and
the
expenses
of
his
living
at
oxford
and
elsewhere
as
he
ate
the
kidneys
eggs
and
sausages
with
which
phoebe
care
had
heaped
the
table
they
had
no
de
foie
it
is
true
but
the
simple
fare
was
of
the
best
quality
as
tozer
had
boasted
tozer
did
not
come
downstairs
to
breakfast
and
thus
phoebe
was
alone
with
the
two
men
who
suited
each
other
so
much
better
than
she
could
have
hoped
the
girl
sat
by
them
languidly
though
with
a
beating
heart
wondering
as
girls
will
wonder
sometimes
if
all
men
were
like
these
braggards
and
believers
in
brag
worshippers
of
money
and
price
no
doubt
young
men
too
marvel
when
they
hear
the
women
about
them
talking
across
them
of
or
of
little
quarrels
and
little
vanities
phoebe
had
more
brains
than
both
of
her
interlocutors
put
together
and
more
added
on
but
she
was
put
down
and
silenced
by
the
talk
her
lover
for
the
moment
had
escaped
from
her
she
could
generally
keep
him
from
exposing
himself
in
this
way
and
turn
the
better
side
of
him
to
the
light
but
the
presence
of
a
believer
in
him
turned
the
head
of
clarence
she
could
not
control
him
any
more
a
good
horse
is
a
deuced
expensive
thing
he
said
the
governor
gave
a
cool
hundred
and
fifty
for
that
mare
that
brought
me
over
this
morning
he
bought
her
from
sir
robert
but
he
did
know
phoebe
the
use
i
was
going
to
put
her
to
if
he
known
he
have
put
that
hundred
and
fifty
in
the
sea
rather
than
have
his
beast
rattled
over
the
country
on
such
an
errand
here
he
stopped
in
the
midst
of
his
breakfast
and
looked
at
her
admiringly
but
i
do
repent
he
added
i
do
it
again
if
it
was
done
already
if
you
stand
by
me
i
face
him
and
twenty
like
him
by
jove
you
do
say
nothing
said
her
grandfather
i
would
be
so
ungrateful
gentlemen
like
copperhead
ai
picked
up
at
every
roadside
they
ai
by
jove
said
clarence
but
she
shy
that
all
about
it
he
added
tenderly
when
we
by
ourselves
i
do
complain
poor
phoebe
she
smiled
a
dismal
smile
and
was
very
glad
when
breakfast
was
over
after
that
she
took
him
into
the
garden
into
the
bright
morning
air
which
kept
her
up
and
where
she
could
keep
her
clarence
in
hand
and
amuse
him
without
allowing
this
revelation
of
the
worst
side
of
him
while
they
were
there
martha
admitted
the
visitor
of
yesterday
simpson
from
the
bank
bringing
back
to
phoebe
mind
all
the
other
matter
of
which
it
had
been
full
do
you
think
you
ought
to
go
and
see
about
the
horse
and
the
she
said
suddenly
turning
to
her
lover
with
one
of
those
sudden
changes
which
kept
the
dull
young
man
amused
you
do
know
what
they
may
be
about
they
ca
be
up
to
much
said
clarence
thank
you
miss
phoebe
i
like
you
better
than
the
mare
but
you
ca
be
here
all
day
and
i
ca
be
here
all
day
she
said
i
must
look
after
grandmamma
and
you
ought
to
go
down
and
inquire
after
poor
may
he
is
so
ill
i
have
been
there
all
night
helping
ursula
you
ought
to
go
and
ask
for
him
people
do
forget
all
the
duties
of
life
because
because
a
thing
of
this
sort
has
happened
because
they
popped
and
been
accepted
said
graceful
clarence
by
jove
i
go
i
tell
young
may
i
like
to
see
his
face
when
i
tell
him
the
news
you
may
look
as
demure
as
you
like
but
you
know
what
spoons
he
has
been
upon
you
and
the
old
fellow
too
made
me
as
jealous
as
king
lear
sometimes
cried
the
happy
lover
with
a
laugh
he
meant
othello
let
us
suppose
nonsense
clarence
but
go
please
go
i
must
run
to
grandmamma
simpson
had
gone
in
and
phoebe
heart
had
begun
to
beat
loudly
in
her
throat
but
it
was
not
so
easy
to
get
rid
of
this
ardent
lover
and
when
at
last
he
did
go
he
was
slightly
sulky
which
was
not
a
state
of
mind
to
be
encouraged
she
rushed
upstairs
to
her
grandmother
room
which
was
over
the
little
room
where
tozer
sat
and
from
which
she
could
already
hear
sounds
of
conversation
rapidly
rising
in
tone
and
the
noise
of
opening
and
shutting
drawers
and
a
general
rummage
phoebe
never
knew
what
she
said
to
the
kind
old
woman
who
kissed
and
wept
over
her
exulting
in
the
news
i
ai
been
so
pleased
since
my
phoebe
told
me
as
she
was
to
marry
a
minister
said
tozer
and
this
is
a
rise
in
life
a
deal
grander
than
the
best
of
ministers
but
bless
your
heart
what
shall
i
do
without
you
cried
the
old
woman
sobbing
presently
tozer
came
in
with
an
air
of
angry
abstraction
and
began
to
search
through
drawers
and
boxes
i
lost
something
he
answered
with
sombre
looks
to
his
inquiry
phoebe
busied
herself
with
her
grandmother
and
did
not
ask
what
it
was
it
was
only
when
he
had
searched
everywhere
that
some
chance
movement
directed
his
eyes
to
her
she
was
trembling
in
spite
of
herself
he
came
up
to
her
and
seized
her
suddenly
by
the
arm
by
george
he
cried
i
in
a
dozen
minds
to
search
you
tozer
let
my
child
alone
how
dare
you
touch
her
her
as
is
as
good
as
copperhead
lady
what
she
got
to
do
with
your
dirty
papers
do
you
think
phoebe
would
touch
them
with
a
pair
of
tongs
cried
the
angry
grandmother
phoebe
shrank
with
all
the
cowardice
of
guilt
her
nerves
were
unstrung
by
weariness
and
excitement
and
tozer
with
his
little
red
eyes
blazing
upon
her
was
very
different
in
this
fury
of
personal
injury
from
the
grandfather
of
the
morning
who
had
been
ready
to
see
every
virtue
in
her
i
believe
as
you
got
it
he
cried
giving
her
a
shake
it
was
a
shot
at
a
venture
said
without
the
least
idea
of
its
truth
but
before
the
words
had
crossed
his
lips
he
felt
with
a
wild
passion
of
rage
and
wonder
that
it
was
true
give
it
up
you
hussy
he
shrieked
with
a
yell
of
fury
his
face
convulsed
with
sudden
rage
thickly
and
with
sputtering
lips
tozer
cried
his
wife
flinging
herself
between
them
take
your
hands
off
the
child
run
run
to
your
room
my
darling
he
out
of
his
senses
lord
bless
us
all
sam
are
you
gone
stark
staring
mad
grandpapa
said
phoebe
trembling
if
i
had
it
you
may
be
sure
it
would
be
safe
out
of
your
way
i
told
you
i
knew
something
about
it
but
you
would
not
hear
me
will
you
hear
me
now
i
make
it
up
to
you
double
it
if
you
like
grandmamma
it
is
a
poor
man
he
would
drive
to
death
if
he
is
not
stopped
oh
cried
phoebe
clasping
her
hands
after
what
has
happened
this
morning
will
you
not
yield
to
me
and
after
all
the
love
you
have
shown
me
i
will
never
ask
anything
not
another
penny
i
will
make
it
up
only
give
in
to
me
give
in
to
me
for
once
in
my
life
grandpapa
i
never
asked
anything
from
you
before
give
it
up
you
piece
of
impudence
you
jade
you
d
d
deceitful
he
was
holding
her
by
the
arm
emphasizing
every
new
word
by
a
violent
shake
while
poor
old
tozer
dropped
into
a
chair
weeping
and
trembling
oh
it
ai
often
as
he
like
this
but
when
he
is
i
ca
do
nothing
with
him
i
ca
do
nothing
with
him
she
cried
but
phoebe
nerves
strung
themselves
up
again
in
face
of
the
crisis
she
shook
him
off
suddenly
with
unexpected
strength
and
moving
to
a
little
distance
stood
confronting
him
pale
but
determined
if
you
think
you
will
get
the
better
of
me
in
this
way
you
are
mistaken
she
said
i
am
not
your
daughter
how
dare
you
treat
me
so
grandmamma
forgive
me
i
have
been
up
all
night
i
am
going
to
lie
down
said
phoebe
if
grandpapa
has
anything
more
to
say
against
me
he
can
say
it
to
clarence
i
leave
myself
in
his
hands
saying
this
she
turned
round
majestically
but
with
an
anxious
heart
and
walked
away
to
her
room
every
nerve
in
her
trembling
when
she
got
there
phoebe
locked
the
door
hastily
in
genuine
terror
and
then
she
laughed
and
then
she
cried
a
little
and
to
think
it
was
here
all
the
time
she
said
to
herself
taking
out
the
little
russia
leather
purse
out
of
her
pocket
she
went
into
the
closet
adjoining
her
room
and
buried
it
deep
in
her
travelling
trunk
which
was
there
relieving
herself
and
her
mind
of
a
danger
then
phoebe
did
what
was
possibly
the
most
sensible
thing
in
the
world
in
every
point
of
view
she
went
to
bed
undressed
herself
quietly
rolled
up
her
hair
and
lay
down
with
a
grateful
sense
of
ease
and
comfort
when
clarence
comes
back
he
will
be
disappointed
but
even
for
clarence
a
little
disappointment
will
be
no
harm
said
the
sensible
young
woman
to
herself
and
what
comfort
it
was
to
lie
down
and
feel
all
the
throbs
and
pulses
gradually
subsiding
the
fright
going
off
the
satisfaction
of
success
coming
back
and
gradually
a
slumberous
delicious
ease
stealing
over
her
of
all
the
clever
things
phoebe
had
done
in
her
life
it
must
be
allowed
that
there
was
not
one
so
masterly
as
the
fact
that
she
then
and
there
went
to
sleep
all
this
had
taken
up
a
good
deal
of
time
it
was
twelve
when
simpson
of
the
bank
disturbed
the
lovers
in
the
garden
and
it
was
one
before
phoebe
put
a
stop
to
all
tozer
vindictive
plans
by
going
to
bed
what
he
said
to
simpson
when
he
went
back
to
him
is
not
on
record
that
excellent
man
of
business
was
much
put
out
by
the
long
waiting
and
intimated
plainly
enough
that
he
could
not
allow
his
time
to
be
thus
wasted
simpson
began
to
think
that
there
was
something
very
strange
in
the
whole
business
tozer
house
was
turned
upside
down
by
it
as
he
could
hear
by
the
passionate
voices
and
the
sound
of
crying
and
storming
in
the
room
above
but
cotsdean
was
secure
in
his
shop
apparently
fearing
no
evil
as
he
had
seen
as
he
passed
peering
in
with
curious
eyes
what
it
meant
he
could
not
tell
but
it
was
queer
and
did
not
look
as
if
the
business
was
when
you
find
the
bill
or
make
up
your
mind
what
to
do
you
can
send
for
me
he
said
and
went
away
suspicious
and
leaving
tozer
to
his
own
devices
and
the
afternoon
passed
in
the
most
uncomfortable
lull
imaginable
though
he
believed
his
granddaughter
to
have
it
he
looked
again
over
all
his
papers
his
drawers
his
every
corner
he
had
in
which
such
a
small
matter
might
have
been
hid
but
naturally
his
search
was
all
in
vain
clarence
returned
in
the
afternoon
and
was
received
by
poor
old
tozer
very
tremulous
and
ready
to
cry
who
did
not
know
whether
she
ought
to
distrust
phoebe
or
not
and
hesitated
and
stumbled
over
her
words
till
the
young
man
thought
his
father
had
come
in
his
absence
and
that
phoebe
had
changed
her
mind
this
had
the
effect
of
making
him
extremely
eager
and
anxious
and
of
subduing
the
bragging
and
magnificent
mood
which
the
triumphant
lover
had
displayed
in
the
morning
he
felt
himself
taken
down
a
peg
or
two
in
his
own
fine
language
he
went
to
the
parsonage
and
tried
very
hard
to
see
ursula
to
secure
her
help
in
case
anything
had
gone
wrong
and
then
to
reginald
whose
vexation
at
the
news
he
felt
sure
of
and
hoped
to
enjoy
a
sight
of
but
he
could
see
no
one
in
the
absorbed
and
anxious
house
what
was
he
to
do
he
wandered
about
growing
more
and
more
unhappy
wondering
if
he
had
been
made
to
fling
himself
into
the
face
of
fate
for
no
reason
and
sure
that
he
could
not
meet
his
father
without
phoebe
support
he
could
not
even
face
her
relations
it
was
very
different
from
the
day
of
triumph
he
had
looked
for
but
as
phoebe
had
wisely
divined
this
disappointment
and
all
the
attending
circumstances
did
not
do
him
any
harm
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
northcote
called
he
too
had
acted
on
the
information
given
by
betsy
and
had
gone
to
cotsdean
who
made
him
vaguely
aware
that
tozer
had
some
share
in
the
business
in
which
may
was
involved
and
who
on
being
asked
whether
it
could
be
set
right
by
money
grew
radiant
and
declared
that
nothing
could
be
easier
but
when
northcote
saw
tozer
there
ensued
a
puzzling
game
at
cross
purposes
for
tozer
had
no
notion
that
may
had
anything
to
do
with
the
business
and
declined
to
understand
i
ai
got
nothing
to
do
with
parsons
and
if
you
take
my
advice
sir
it
be
a
deal
better
for
you
to
give
up
too
the
connection
for
no
good
you
are
said
tozer
surely
by
right
of
his
own
troubles
and
perplexities
and
glad
to
think
he
could
make
some
one
else
uncomfortable
too
i
shall
do
in
that
respect
as
i
think
proper
said
northcote
who
was
not
disposed
to
submit
to
dictation
fact
is
he
a
deal
too
well
off
for
a
minister
tozer
said
to
his
wife
when
the
young
man
disappeared
they
too
independent
that
sort
and
i
do
know
what
he
means
by
his
mays
and
his
fine
folks
what
have
we
got
to
do
with
mr
may
except
that
he
been
good
to
the
child
tozer
we
ca
forget
as
been
very
good
to
the
child
oh
dash
the
child
cried
the
old
man
infuriated
if
you
say
much
more
i
be
sorry
i
ever
let
you
see
her
face
what
has
she
done
with
my
bill
bill
if
it
only
a
bill
what
are
you
so
put
out
about
cried
tozer
you
have
dozens
again
at
christmas
if
that
is
all
you
want
but
the
laugh
was
unsuccessful
and
the
old
man
went
back
to
his
room
to
nurse
his
wrath
and
to
wonder
what
had
come
to
him
why
had
his
granddaughter
interfered
in
his
business
and
what
had
he
to
do
with
may
phoebe
got
up
refreshed
and
comfortable
when
it
was
time
for
the
family
tea
and
came
down
to
her
lover
who
had
come
back
and
was
sitting
very
dejected
by
old
tozer
side
she
was
fresh
and
fair
and
in
one
of
her
prettiest
dresses
having
taken
pains
for
him
and
notwithstanding
tozer
lowering
aspect
and
his
refusal
to
speak
to
her
the
meal
passed
over
very
cheerfully
for
the
rest
of
the
party
and
the
two
young
people
once
more
withdrew
to
the
garden
when
it
was
over
the
presence
of
clarence
copperhead
protected
phoebe
from
all
attack
her
grandfather
dared
not
fly
out
upon
her
as
before
or
summon
her
to
give
up
what
she
had
taken
from
him
whatever
happened
this
wonderful
rise
in
life
this
grand
match
could
not
be
interfered
with
he
withdrew
bitter
and
exasperated
to
his
own
den
leaving
his
poor
wife
crying
and
wretched
in
the
family
tozer
knew
that
her
husband
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
and
that
though
the
circumstances
of
phoebe
betrothal
subdued
him
for
the
moment
this
effect
in
all
probability
would
not
last
and
she
sat
in
terror
watching
the
moments
as
they
passed
and
trembling
to
think
what
might
happen
when
the
young
pair
came
in
again
or
when
clarence
at
last
went
away
leaving
phoebe
with
no
protection
but
herself
phoebe
too
while
she
kept
her
dull
companion
happy
kept
thinking
all
the
while
of
the
same
thing
with
a
great
tremor
of
suppressed
agitation
in
her
mind
and
she
did
not
know
what
was
the
next
step
to
take
a
reflection
which
took
away
her
strength
she
had
taken
the
bill
from
her
trunk
again
and
replaced
it
in
her
pocket
it
was
safest
carried
on
her
person
she
felt
but
what
she
was
to
do
next
even
phoebe
so
fruitful
in
resources
could
not
say
when
northcote
came
back
in
the
evening
she
felt
that
her
game
was
becoming
more
and
more
difficult
to
play
after
a
brief
consultation
with
herself
she
decided
that
it
was
most
expedient
to
go
in
with
him
taking
her
big
along
with
her
and
confiding
in
his
stupidity
not
to
find
out
more
than
was
indispensable
she
took
northcote
to
her
grandfather
room
whispering
to
him
on
the
way
to
make
himself
the
representative
of
cotsdean
only
and
to
say
nothing
of
may
then
you
know
about
it
said
northcote
amazed
oh
hush
hush
cried
phoebe
offer
to
pay
it
on
cotsdean
part
and
say
nothing
about
mr
may
the
young
man
looked
at
her
bewildered
but
nodded
his
head
in
assent
and
then
her
own
young
man
pulled
her
back
almost
roughly
and
demanded
to
know
what
she
meant
by
talking
to
that
fellow
so
thus
poor
phoebe
was
between
two
fires
she
went
in
with
a
fainting
yet
courageous
heart
pay
the
money
said
tozer
who
by
dint
of
brooding
over
it
all
the
day
had
come
to
a
white
heat
and
was
no
longer
to
be
controlled
northcote

pot
of

the
poor
old
fellow

but
what
the
good
of
throwing
anything

her
give
it
up
cried
tozer
hoarsely
or
out
of
this
house
she
goes
this
very
night
i
ai
the
sort
of
man
to
be
made
a
fool
of
i
ai
the
sort
of
man
who

more
of
your
d
d
intercessors

cried
the
old
man
but
i
wo
have
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
them
what
who
father
i
ai
ashamed
to
meet
copperhead
father
but
one
thing
at
a
time
them
as
comes
into
my
house
must
wait
my
time
cried
the
butterman
seeing
vaguely
the
group
come
in
whom
we
left
at
his
doors
i
master
here
give
up
that
bill
you
brazen
young
hussy
and
go
out
of
my
sight
how
dare
you
set
up
your
face
among
so
many
men
give
it
up
he
cried
seizing
her
by
the
elbow
in
renewed
fury
the
strangers
though
he
saw
them
enter
received
no
salutation
from
him
there
was
one
small
lamp
on
the
table
dimly
lighted
which
threw
a
faint
glow
upon
the
circle
of
countenances
round
into
which
came
wondering
the
burly
big
copperhead
holding
fast
by
the
shoulder
of
may
whose
ghastly
face
contorted
with
wild
anxiety
glanced
at
tozer
over
the
lamp
but
the
old
man
was
so
much
absorbed
at
first
that
he
scarcely
saw
who
the
were
what
all
this
about
said
copperhead
seems
we
come
into
the
midst
of
another
commotion
so
you
here
clar
it
is
you
i
want
my
boy
look
here
northcote
take
hold
will
you
there
a
screw
loose
and
we
got
to
get
him
home
take
hold
till
i
have
had
a
word
with
clarence
that
a
thing
that
wo
take
long
clarence
cast
a
glance
at
phoebe
who
even
in
her
own
agitation
turned
and
gave
him
a
tremulous
smile
of
encouragement
the
crisis
was
so
great
on
all
sides
of
her
that
phoebe
became
heroic
i
am
here
she
said
with
all
the
steadiness
of
strong
emotion
and
when
he
had
received
this
assurance
of
support
he
feared
his
father
no
more
all
right
sir
he
said
almost
with
alacrity
he
was
afraid
of
nothing
with
phoebe
standing
by
make
her
give
me
up
my
bill
said
tozer
i
hear
nothing
else
till
this
is
settled
my
bill
it
forgery
that
what
it
is
do
speak
to
me
about
money
i
have
him
punished
i
have
him
rot
in
prison
for
it
i
not
cheat
the
law
you
people
as
has
influence
with
that
girl
make
her
give
it
me
i
ca
touch
him
without
the
bill
may
had
been
placed
in
a
chair
by
the
two
young
men
who
watched
over
him
but
as
tozer
spoke
he
got
up
struggling
wildly
almost
tearing
himself
out
of
the
coat
by
which
they
held
him
let
me
go
he
said
do
you
hear
him
rot
in
prison
with
hard
labour
it
would
kill
me
and
it
used
to
be
hanging
my
god
my
god
wo
you
let
me
go
tozer
stopped
short
stopped
by
this
passion
which
was
greater
than
his
own
he
looked
wonderingly
at
the
livid
face
the
struggling
figure
impressed
in
spite
of
himself
he
gone
mad
he
said
good
lord
but
he
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
ca
you
take
him
away
grandpapa
said
phoebe
in
his
ear
here
it
is
your
bill
it
was
who
did
it
and
it
has
driven
him
mad
look
i
give
it
up
to
you
and
there
he
is
that
is
your
work
now
do
what
you
please
trembling
the
old
man
took
the
paper
out
of
her
hand
he
gazed
wondering
at
the
other
who
somehow
moved
in
his
excitement
by
a
sense
that
the
decisive
moment
had
come
stood
still
too
his
arm
out
of
his
coat
his
face
wild
with
dread
and
horror
for
a
moment
they
looked
at
each
other
in
a
common
agony
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
clear
enough
to
understand
but
both
feeling
that
some
tremendous
crisis
had
come
upon
them
he
done
it
said
tozer
appalled
and
almost
speechless
done
it
they
all
crowded
round
a
circle
of
scared
faces
phoebe
alone
stood
calm
she
was
the
only
one
who
knew
the
whole
except
the
culprit
who
understood
nothing
with
that
mad
confusion
in
his
eyes
but
he
was
overawed
too
and
in
his
very
madness
recognized
the
crisis
he
stood
still
struggling
no
longer
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
homely
figure
of
the
old
butterman
who
stood
trembling
thunderstruck
with
that
fatal
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
tozer
had
been
mad
for
revenge
two
moments
before
almost
as
wild
as
the
guilty
man
before
him
with
a
fierce
desire
to
punish
and
make
an
example
of
the
man
who
had
wronged
him
but
this
was
arrested
by
the
sight
of
the
other
madman
before
him
and
by
the
extraordinary
shock
of
this
revelation
it
took
all
the
strength
out
of
him
he
had
not
looked
up
to
the
clergyman
as
cotsdean
did
but
he
had
looked
up
to
the
gentleman
his
customer
as
being
upon
an
elevation
very
different
from
his
own
altogether
above
and
beyond
him
and
the
sight
of
this
superior
being
thus
humbled
maddened
gazing
at
him
with
wild
terror
and
agony
more
eloquent
than
any
supplication
struck
poor
old
tozer
to
the
very
soul
god
help
us
all
he
cried
out
with
a
broken
sobbing
voice
he
was
but
a
vulgar
old
fellow
mean
it
might
be
worldly
in
his
way
but
the
terrible
mystery
of
human
wickedness
and
guilt
prostrated
his
common
soul
with
as
sharp
an
anguish
of
pity
and
shame
as
could
have
befallen
the
most
heroic
it
seized
upon
him
so
that
he
could
say
or
do
nothing
more
forcing
hot
and
salt
tears
up
into
his
old
eyes
and
shaking
him
all
over
with
a
tremor
as
of
palsy
the
scared
faces
appeared
to
come
closer
to
phoebe
to
whom
these
moments
seemed
like
years
had
her
trust
been
vain
softly
but
with
an
excitement
beyond
control
she
touched
him
on
the
arm
that
true
said
tozer
something
got
to
be
done
we
ca
all
stand
here
for
ever
phoebe
it
him
as
has
to
be
thought
of
show
it
to
him
poor
gentleman
if
he
ai
past
knowing
and
burn
it
and
let
us
hear
of
it
no
more
solemnly
in
the
midst
of
them
all
phoebe
held
up
the
paper
before
the
eyes
of
the
guilty
man
if
he
understood
it
or
not
no
one
could
tell
he
did
not
move
but
stared
blankly
at
her
and
it
then
she
held
it
over
the
lamp
and
let
it
blaze
and
drop
into
harmless
ashes
in
the
midst
of
them
all
tozer
dropped
down
into
his
sniffing
and
sobbing
may
stood
quite
still
with
a
look
of
utter
dulness
and
stupidity
coming
over
the
face
in
which
so
much
terror
had
been
if
he
understood
what
had
passed
it
was
only
in
feeling
not
in
intelligence
he
grew
still
and
dull
in
the
midst
of
that
strange
madness
which
all
the
time
was
only
a
mixture
of
conscious
excitement
and
anxiety
with
that
which
passes
the
boundaries
of
consciousness
for
the
moment
he
was
stilled
into
stupid
idiotcy
and
looked
at
them
with
vacant
eyes
as
for
the
others
northcote
was
the
only
one
who
divined
at
all
what
this
scene
meant
to
reginald
it
was
like
a
scene
in
a
pantomime
bewildering
dumb
show
with
no
sense
or
meaning
in
it
it
was
he
who
spoke
first
with
a
certain
impatience
of
the
occurrence
which
he
did
not
understand
will
you
come
home
sir
now
he
said
come
home
for
heaven
sake
northcote
will
give
you
an
arm
he
very
ill
reginald
added
looking
round
him
pitifully
in
his
ignorance
what
you
are
thinking
of
i
tell
but
he
ill
and
delirious
it
was
copperhead
who
brought
him
here
against
my
will
excuse
me
miss
beecham
now
i
must
take
him
home
yes
said
phoebe
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
him
he
was
not
thinking
of
her
at
the
moment
but
she
knew
he
had
thought
of
her
much
and
tenderly
and
she
felt
that
she
might
never
see
him
again
phoebe
would
have
liked
him
to
know
what
she
had
done
and
to
know
that
what
she
had
done
was
for
him
chiefly
in
order
to
recompense
him
a
little
poor
fellow
for
the
heart
he
had
given
her
which
she
could
not
accept
yet
could
not
be
ungrateful
for
and
yet
she
was
glad
though
there
was
a
pang
in
it
that
he
should
never
know
and
remain
unaware
of
her
effort
for
his
own
sake
but
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
him
and
he
caught
the
gleam
of
the
moisture
which
made
his
heart
beat
something
moved
her
beyond
what
he
knew
of
and
his
heart
thrilled
with
tenderness
and
wonder
but
how
should
he
know
what
it
was
give
my
love
to
ursula
she
said
i
shall
not
come
as
she
has
a
nurse
and
i
think
he
will
be
better
make
her
rest
may
and
if
i
do
see
her
say
to
her
for
me
yes
things
have
happened
tell
her
i
hope
she
will
not
forget
me
said
phoebe
the
tears
dropping
down
her
cheeks
but
oh
please
never
mind
me
look
at
him
he
is
quite
quiet
he
is
worn
out
take
him
home
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
done
said
poor
reginald
whose
heart
began
to
ache
with
a
sense
of
the
unknown
which
surrounded
him
on
every
side
he
took
his
father
by
the
arm
who
had
been
standing
quite
silent
motionless
and
apathetic
he
had
no
need
for
any
help
for
may
went
with
him
at
a
touch
as
docile
as
a
child
northcote
followed
with
grave
looks
and
very
sad
tozer
had
been
seated
in
his
favourite
chair
much
subdued
and
giving
vent
now
and
then
to
something
like
a
sob
his
nerves
had
been
terribly
shaken
but
as
he
saw
the
three
gentlemen
going
away
nature
awoke
in
the
old
butterman
he
put
out
his
hand
and
plucked
northcote
by
the
sleeve
i
not
say
no
to
that
money
not
now
northcote
sir
he
said
chapter
xliv
phœbe
last
trial
now
if
you
please
said
copperhead
i
think
it
my
turn
i
wanted
may
to
hear
what
i
had
got
to
say
but
as
he
ill
or
mad
or
something
it
is
not
much
good
i
ca
imagine
what
all
these
incantations
meant
and
all
your
play
miss
phoebe
eyes
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
do
suit
us
plain
folks
if
you
do
mind
following
your
friends
i
want
to
speak
to
old
tozer
here
by
himself
i
do
like
to
have
women
meddling
in
my
affairs
grandpapa
is
very
tired
and
he
is
upset
said
phoebe
i
do
think
he
can
have
any
more
said
to
him
by
george
but
he
shall
though
and
you
too

said
copperhead

well

i
ai
a
man
that

of

may
talk

but

boy

if

phoebe
but

not
ask
him

give
your
orders
to
your
son
copperhead
you
have
no
right
to
dictate
to
me
grandpapa
i
think
you
and
i
have
had
enough
for
with
this
phoebe
began
to
close
the
shutters
which
had
been
left
open
and
to
put
away
books
and
things
which
were
lying
about
tozer
made
a
feeble
attempt
to
stop
her
energetic
proceedings
talk
to
the
gentleman
phoebe
if
copperhead
anything
to
say
to
you
do
do
you
go
and
offend
him
my
dear
the
old
man
cried
in
an
anxious
whisper
and
then
he
raised
himself
from
the
chair
in
which
he
had
sunk
exhausted
by
the
unusual
commotions
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
i
am
sure
sir
tozer
began
it
ai
my
wish
nor
the
wish
o
my
family
to
do
anything
as
is
against
your
wishes
grandpapa
said
phoebe
interrupting
him
ruthlessly
wishes
may
be
a
rule
to
his
own
family
but
they
are
not
to
be
a
rule
to
yours
for
my
part
i
wo
submit
to
it
let
him
take
his
son
away
if
he
pleases
or
if
he
can
she
added
turning
round
upon
clarence
with
a
smile
clarence
copperhead
is
as
free
as
i
am
to
go
or
to
stay
by
jove
cried
that
young
man
who
had
been
hanging
in
the
background
dark
and
miserable
he
came
close
up
to
her
and
caught
first
her
sleeve
and
then
her
elbow
the
contact
seemed
to
give
him
strength
look
here
sir
he
said
ingratiatingly
we
do
want
to
offend
you
want
to
fly
in
your
face
but
i
ca
go
on
having
coaches
for
ever
and
here
the
only
one
in
the
world
that
can
do
the
business
instead
of
coaches
phoebe
knows
i
fond
of
her
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
here
is
the
one
that
can
make
something
of
me
i
ai
clever
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
but
she
is
i
do
mind
going
into
parliament
making
speeches
and
that
sort
of
thing
if
i
got
her
to
back
me
up
but
without
her
i
never
do
anything
without
her
you
may
put
me
in
a
cupboard
as
you
often
said
let
me
have
her
and
i
make
a
figure
and
do
you
credit
i
ca
say
any
fairer
said
clarence
taking
the
rest
of
her
arm
into
his
grasp
and
holding
her
hand
he
was
stupid
but
he
was
a
man
and
phoebe
felt
proud
of
him
for
the
moment
at
least
you
idiot
cried
his
father
and
i
was
an
idiot
too
to
put
any
faith
in
you
come
away
from
that
artful
girl
ca
you
see
that
it
all
a
plan
from
beginning
to
end
what
was
she
sent
down
here
for
but
to
catch
you
you
oaf
you
fool
you
drop
her
or
you
drop
me
all
i
got
to
say
yes
drop
me
clarence
said
phoebe
with
a
smile
for
in
the
mean
time
you
hurt
me
see
you
have
bruised
my
arm
while
you
settle
this
question
with
your
father
i
will
go
to
grandmamma
pardon
me
i
take
more
interest
in
her
than
in
this
discussion
between
him
and
you
you
sha
go
cried
her
lover
not
a
step
look
here
sir
if
what
it
comes
to
her
before
you
what
you
made
of
me
ai
much
is
it
but
i
do
mind
what
i
go
in
for
as
long
as
she
to
the
fore
her
before
you
is
that
your
last
word
said
copperhead
yes
his
son
faced
him
with
a
face
as
set
and
cloudy
as
his
own
the
mouth
shut
close
and
sullen
was
the
same
in
both
but
those
brown
eyes
which
clarence
got
from
his
mother
and
which
were
usually
mild
in
their
expression
looking
out
gently
from
the
ruder
face
to
which
they
did
not
seem
to
belong
were
now
not
clear
but
muddy
with
resolution
glimmering
with
dogged
obstinacy
from
under
the
drooping
eyelids
he
was
not
like
himself
he
was
as
he
had
been
that
day
when
may
saw
him
at
the
dorsets
determined
more
than
a
match
for
his
father
who
had
only
the
obstinacy
of
his
own
nature
not
that
dead
resisting
force
of
two
people
to
bring
to
the
battle
clarence
had
all
the
pertinacity
that
was
not
in
his
mother
to
reinforce
his
own
copperhead
stared
at
his
son
with
that
look
of
authority
with
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
crushing
all
who
resisted
him
but
clarence
did
not
quail
he
stood
dull
and
immovable
his
eyes
contracted
his
face
stolid
and
void
of
all
expression
but
that
of
resistance
he
was
not
much
more
than
a
fool
but
just
by
so
much
as
his
father
was
more
reasonable
more
than
himself
was
clarence
stronger
than
his
father
he
held
phoebe
by
the
sleeve
that
she
might
not
escape
him
but
he
faced
copperhead
with
a
dull
determination
that
all
the
powers
of
earth
could
not
shake
for
the
moment
the
father
lost
his
then
i
go
he
said
and
when
you
changed
your
mind
you
can
come
to
me
but
here
he
swore
a
big
oath
mind
what
you
about
there
never
was
a
man
yet
but
repented
when
he
set
himself
against
me
clarence
made
no
answer
talking
was
not
in
his
way
and
copperhead
showed
his
wondering
apprehension
of
a
power
superior
to
his
own
by
making
a
pause
after
he
had
said
this
and
not
going
away
directly
he
stopped
and
tried
once
more
to
influence
the
rebel
with
that
stare
phoebe
phoebe
for
god
sake
make
him
give
in
and
do
go
against
mr
copperhead
cried
tozer
tremulous
voice
shaken
with
weakness
and
anxiety
but
phoebe
did
not
say
anything
she
felt
in
the
hesitation
the
pause
the
despairing
last
effort
to
conquer
that
the
time
of
her
triumph
had
nearly
come
when
he
went
away
they
all
stood
still
and
listened
to
his
footsteps
going
along
the
passage
and
through
the
garden
when
he
was
outside
he
paused
again
evidently
with
the
idea
of
returning
but
changed
his
mind
and
went
on
to
be
left
like
this
the
victors
on
a
field
of
domestic
conflict
is
very
often
not
at
all
a
triumphant
feeling
and
involves
a
sense
of
defeat
about
as
bad
as
the
reality
experienced
by
the
vanquished
phoebe
who
was
imaginative
and
had
lively
feeling
felt
a
cold
shiver
go
over
her
as
the
steps
went
away
one
by
one
and
began
to
cry
softly
not
knowing
quite
why
it
was
but
clarence
who
had
no
imagination
nor
any
feelings
to
speak
of
was
at
his
ease
and
perfectly
calm
what
are
you
crying
for
he
said
the
governor
can
do
what
he
likes
i
marry
you
in
spite
of
a
hundred
like
him
he
did
know
what
he
was
about
did
the
governor
when
he
tackled
but
clarence
you
must
not
break
with
your
father
you
must
not
quarrel
on
my
account
that
as
it
may
be
he
said
never
you
mind
when
it
cleverness
that
wanted
it
you
that
wanted
to
back
me
up
but
i
can
stick
to
my
own
way
without
you
and
my
way
is
this
he
said
suddenly
lifting
her
from
the
ground
holding
her
waist
between
his
two
big
hands
and
giving
her
an
emphatic
kiss
phoebe
was
silenced
altogether
when
this
had
happened
he
was
a
blockhead
but
he
was
a
man
and
could
stand
up
for
his
love
and
for
his
own
rights
as
a
man
independent
of
the
world
she
felt
a
genuine
admiration
for
her
lout
at
that
moment
but
this
admiration
was
accompanied
by
a
very
chill
sense
of
all
that
might
be
forfeited
if
copperhead
stood
out
clarence
poor
and
disowned
by
his
father
would
be
a
very
different
person
from
the
clarence
copperhead
who
was
going
into
parliament
and
had
a
fine
position
in
prospect
she
did
not
form
any
resolutions
as
to
what
she
would
do
in
that
case
for
she
was
incapable
of
anything
dishonourable
but
it
made
her
shiver
as
with
a
cold
icy
current
running
over
and
as
for
poor
old
tozer
he
was
all
but
whimpering
in
his
chair
oh
lord
he
cried
a
great
man
like
copperhead
affronted
in
my
it
what
i
never
thought
to
see
a
friend
of
the
connection
like
that
your
father
leading
member
oh
phoebe
it
was
an
evil
day
as
brought
you
here
to
make
all
this
mischief
and
if
i
had
known
what
was
going
on
cried
tozer
almost
weeping
in
his
despair
you
are
tired
grandpapa
said
phoebe
do
be
frightened
about
us
copperhead
is
very
fond
of
clarence
and
he
will
give
in
or
if
he
does
give
in
still
we
shall
not
be
worse
off
than
many
other
people
but
she
said
this
with
a
secret
panic
devouring
her
soul
wondering
if
it
was
possible
that
such
a
horrible
revolution
of
circumstances
and
change
of
everything
she
had
looked
for
could
be
even
clarence
was
silenced
though
immovable
he
went
away
soon
after
and
betook
himself
to
his
room
at
the
parsonage
where
all
his
possessions
still
were
while
phoebe
attended
upon
her
grandmother
whose
agitation
and
fear
she
calmed
without
saying
much
tozer
quite
broken
down
retired
to
bed
and
when
they
were
all
disposed
of
phoebe
went
out
to
the
garden
and
made
a
mournful
little
promenade
there
with
very
serious
thoughts
if
clarence
was
to
be
cast
off
by
his
father
what
could
she
do
with
him
it
was
not
in
phoebe
to
abandon
the
stupid
lover
who
had
stood
up
so
manfully
for
her
no
she
must
accept
her
fate
however
the
balance
turned
but
if
this
dreadful
change
happened
what
should
she
do
with
him
the
question
penetrated
and
made
her
shiver
to
the
depths
of
her
soul
but
never
even
in
imagination
did
she
forsake
him
he
was
hers
now
come
good
or
ill
but
the
prospect
of
the
ill
was
appalling
to
her
she
went
up
and
down
the
slowly
in
the
silence
looking
up
to
the
stars
with
her
heart
very
full
phoebe
felt
that
no
usual
burden
had
been
put
upon
her
last
night
her
occupation
had
been
one
of
the
purest
charity
and
this
providence
had
seemed
to
recompense
in
the
morning
by
dropping
at
her
very
feet
the
prize
she
had
long
meant
to
win
but
now
she
was
down
again
after
being
lifted
up
so
high
and
a
great
part
of
its
value
was
taken
out
of
that
prize
was
she
mercenary
or
in
her
choice
it
would
be
hard
to
say
so
for
she
never
questioned
with
herself
whether
or
not
she
should
follow
clarence
into
obscurity
and
poverty
if
things
should
turn
out
so
she
would
never
abandon
him
however
bad
his
case
might
be
but
her
heart
sunk
very
low
when
she
thought
of
her
future
with
him
without
the
career
which
would
have
made
everything
sweet
copperhead
too
had
very
serious
thoughts
on
this
subject
and
sat
up
long
drinking
and
knitting
his
brows
as
he
turned
the
subject
over
and
over
in
his
mind
recognizing
with
disgust
in
which
nevertheless
there
mingled
a
certain
respect
that
clarence
would
not
yield
he
was
as
obstinate
as
himself
or
more
so
he
had
gone
to
the
inn
where
he
was
alone
without
any
of
his
usual
comforts
it
was
perhaps
the
first
time
in
his
prosperous
life
that
he
had
ever
been
really
crossed
joe
had
never
attempted
to
do
it
nor
any
of
the
first
family
they
had
married
as
they
had
done
everything
else
according
to
his
dictation
and
now
here
was
his
useless
son
his
exotic
plant
his
dresden
china
not
only
asserting
a
will
of
his
own
but
meaning
to
have
it
and
showing
a
resolution
a
determination
equal
to
his
own
his
mother
had
never
shown
anything
of
this
she
had
yielded
as
every
one
else
had
yielded
copperhead
reflected
to
whatever
he
ordered
where
had
the
boy
got
this
unsuspected
strength
a
kind
of
smile
broke
unawares
over
the
rich
man
face
as
he
asked
himself
this
question
a
smile
which
he
chased
away
with
a
frown
but
which
nevertheless
had
been
there
for
a
moment
roused
by
a
subtle
suggestion
of
where
but
from
himself
had
his
as
the
millionnaire
proudly
held
him
to
be
got
that
strength
of
obstinacy
he
chased
the
thought
and
the
smile
away
with
a
frown
and
went
to
bed
gloomily
nursing
his
wrath
but
yet
this
suggestion
which
he
himself
had
made
was
more
flattering
to
himself
than
words
can
say
as
for
clarence
the
only
other
person
deeply
concerned
after
he
had
asked
for
may
and
expressed
his
regret
to
learn
how
ill
he
was
the
young
man
smoked
a
cigar
on
the
doorsteps
and
then
went
peaceably
without
either
care
or
anxiety
to
bed
where
he
slept
very
soundly
till
eight
next
morning
which
was
the
hour
at
which
he
was
called
though
he
did
not
always
get
up
when
copperhead
began
the
new
day
he
began
it
with
a
very
unwise
idea
quickly
carried
out
as
unwise
ideas
generally
are
feeling
that
he
could
make
nothing
of
his
son
he
resolved
to
try
what
he
could
make
of
phoebe
a
young
woman
nay
a
bit
of
a
girl
not
more
than
twenty
and
a
minister
daughter
brought
up
in
reverence
of
the
leading
member
any
resistance
on
her
part
seemed
really
incredible
he
could
not
contemplate
the
idea
of
giving
up
all
the
cherished
plans
of
his
life
by
a
melodramatic
renunciation
of
his
son
to
give
up
clarence
whom
he
had
trained
to
be
the
very
apex
and
crowning
point
of
his
grandeur
was
intolerable
to
him
but
copperhead
had
heard
before
now
of
young
women
who
goaded
to
it
had
been
known
to
give
up
their
lover
rather
than
let
their
lover
suffer
on
their
account
and
if
this
had
ever
been
the
case
surely
it
might
be
so
in
the
present
instance
had
he
not
the
comfort
of
the
beecham
family
in
his
hands
could
not
he
make
the
crescent
chapel
too
hot
to
hold
them
could
he
not
awaken
the
fears
of
scores
of
other
fathers
very
unlikely
to
permit
their
favourite
sons
to
stray
into
the
hands
of
pastors
daughters
there
was
nothing
indeed
to
be
said
against
beecham
but
still
it
would
be
strange
if
copperhead
out
and
away
the
richest
man
in
the
community
could
not
make
the
crescent
too
hot
to
hold
him
he
went
down
the
lane
from
the
george
where
he
had
slept
quite
early
next
morning
with
this
purpose
full
in
his
head
and
as
good
luck
he
thought
would
have
it
found
phoebe
who
had
been
restless
all
night
with
anxiety
and
had
got
up
early
once
more
walking
up
and
down
the
long
reflecting
over
all
that
had
happened
and
wondering
as
to
what
might
happen
still
what
a
piece
of
luck
it
was
he
was
accustomed
to
have
fortune
on
his
side
and
it
seemed
natural
to
him
he
went
up
to
her
with
scarcely
a
pause
for
the
usual
salutations
and
plunged
at
once
into
what
he
had
to
say
miss
phoebe
i
am
glad
to
find
you
alone
i
wanted
a
word
with
you
he
said
about
the
affair
of
last
night
why
should
you
and
i
the
only
two
sensible
ones
in
the
business
settle
it
between
ourselves
old
tozer
is
an
old
ass
begging
your
pardon
for
saying
so
and
my
son
is
a
fool
i
do
not
agree
to
either
said
phoebe
gravely
but
never
mind
i
will
certainly
hear
what
you
have
to
say
what
i
have
to
say
is
this
i
will
never
consent
to
let
my
son
clarence
marry
you
here
he
was
interrupted
by
a
serious
little
bow
of
assent
from
phoebe
which
disconcerted
and
angered
him
strangely
this
being
the
case
he
resumed
more
hotly
do
you
think
we
better
come
to
terms
you
and
me
you
are
too
sensible
a
girl
i
be
bound
to
marry
a
man
without
a
penny
which
is
what
he
would
be
he
would
be
properly
made
an
end
of
miss
phoebe
if
he
found
out
after
all
his
bravado
last
night
that
you
were
the
one
to
cast
him
off
after
all
he
can
not
find
that
out
said
phoebe
with
a
smile
unfortunately
even
if
i
could
have
done
it
under
brighter
circumstances
my
mouth
is
closed
now
i
desert
him
now
when
he
is
in
trouble
of
course
you
do
not
know
me
so
you
are
excused
for
thinking
so
mr
copperhead
the
rich
man
stared
she
was
speaking
a
language
which
he
did
not
understand
look
here
miss
phoebe
he
said
let
understand
each
other
high
horses
do
answer
with
me
as
for
deserting
him
when
in
trouble
if
you
give
him
up
or
desert
him
as
you
call
it
he
need
never
be
in
trouble
at
all
you
can
stop
all
that
just
you
say
no
to
him
and
he
soon
be
on
his
knees
to
me
to
think
no
more
of
it
you
know
who
i
am
copperhead
continued
with
a
concealed
threat
i
have
a
deal
of
influence
in
the
connection
though
i
say
it
that
should
and
i
very
well
looked
on
in
chapel
business
what
would
the
crescent
do
without
me
and
if
there
should
be
an
unpleasantness
between
the
minister
and
the
leading
member
why
you
know
miss
phoebe
no
one
better
who
it
is
that
would
go
to
the
wall
she
made
no
answer
and
he
thought
she
was
impressed
by
his
arguments
he
went
on
still
more
strongly
than
before
such
a
clever
girl
as
you
knows
all
that
said
copperhead
and
suppose
you
were
to
marry
clarence
without
a
penny
what
would
become
of
you
what
would
you
make
of
him
he
is
too
lazy
for
hard
work
and
he
has
not
brains
enough
for
anything
else
what
would
you
make
of
him
if
you
had
him
that
what
i
want
to
know
and
that
is
just
what
i
ca
tell
you
said
phoebe
smiling
it
is
a
very
serious
question
i
suppose
something
will
turn
up
what
can
turn
up
you
marry
him
because
he
is
going
into
parliament
and
could
give
you
a
fine
position
i
confess
said
phoebe
with
her
usual
frankness
that
i
did
think
of
his
career
without
that
the
future
is
much
darker
and
rather
depressing
yes
you
see
that
a
poor
clod
of
a
fellow
that
ca
work
and
will
be
hanging
upon
you
every
day
keeping
you
from
working
that
you
will
never
be
able
to
make
anything
of
copperhead
said
phoebe
sweetly
why
do
you
tell
all
this
to
me
your
mere
good
sense
will
show
you
that
i
can
not
budge
i
have
accepted
him
being
rich
and
i
can
not
throw
him
over
when
he
is
poor
i
may
not
like
it
i
do
like
it
but
i
am
helpless
whatever
change
is
made
it
can
not
be
made
by
me
he
stared
at
her
in
blank
wonder
and
dismay
for
a
moment
he
could
not
say
anything
look
here
he
faltered
at
last
you
thought
him
a
great
match
a
rise
in
the
world
for
you
and
yours
but
he
ai
a
great
match
any
longer
what
the
use
then
of
keeping
up
the
farce
you
and
me
understand
each
other
you
nothing
to
do
but
to
let
him
off
young
and
pretty
you
easily
find
some
one
else
fools
are
plenty
in
this
world
he
added
unable
to
refrain
from
that
one
fling
let
him
off
and
all
will
be
right
what
to
prevent
you
i
not
lose
a
moment
if
i
were
you
phoebe
laughed
she
had
a
pretty
laugh
soft
yet
ringing
like
a
child
you
and
i
i
fear
are
no
rule
for
each
other
she
said
copperhead
what
prevents
me
is
a
small
thing
called
honour
that
is
all
honour
that
for
men
he
said
hastily
and
folly
for
them
according
as
you
mean
it
but
for
women
there
no
such
thing
it
sham
and
humbug
and
look
you
here
miss
phoebe
he
continued
losing
his
temper
you
see
what
your
father
will
say
to
this
when
you
get
him
into
hot
water
with
his
people
there
more
men
with
sons
than
me
and
if
the
crescent
ai
too
hot
to
hold
him
within
a
month
do
you
think
stand
it
a
beggarly
minister
and
his
belongings
coming
in
the
way
of
a
man
that
could
buy
you
all
up
twenty
times
over
and
more
the
fury
into
which
he
had
worked
himself
took
away
breath
phoebe
said
nothing
she
went
on
by
his
side
with
soft
steps
her
face
a
little
downcast
the
suspicion
of
a
smile
about
her
mouth
by
george
he
cried
when
he
had
recovered
himself
you
think
you
can
laugh
at
me
you
think
you
can
defy
me
you
a
bit
of
a
girl
as
poor
as
job
i
defy
no
one
said
phoebe
i
can
not
prevent
you
from
insulting
me
that
is
all
which
is
rather
hard
she
added
with
a
smile
which
cost
her
an
effort
seeing
that
i
shall
have
to
drag
your
son
through
the
world
somehow
now
that
you
have
cast
him
off
he
will
not
give
me
up
i
know
and
honour
prevents
me
from
giving
him
up
so
i
shall
have
hard
work
enough
without
any
insults
from
you
it
is
a
pity
said
phoebe
with
a
sort
of
sympathetic
regret
for
herself
so
badly
used
i
could
have
made
a
man
of
him
i
could
have
backed
him
up
to
get
on
as
well
as
most
men
but
it
will
certainly
be
uphill
work
now
she
did
not
look
at
the
furious
father
as
she
spoke
she
was
quite
calm
treating
it
reflectively
regretfully
as
a
thing
past
and
over
copperhead
tried
to
burst
forth
again
in
threats
and
objurgations
but
in
spite
of
himself
and
though
she
never
said
another
word
the
big
rich
noisy
man
was
silenced
he
went
away
threatening
to
appeal
to
her
father
which
phoebe
with
a
last
effort
begged
him
smilingly
to
do
but
this
was
the
last
of
which
she
was
capable
when
she
had
closed
the
door
after
him
she
rushed
upstairs
to
her
room
and
cried
bitterly
everything
was
very
dark
to
her
if
he
did
appeal
to
her
father
the
appeal
would
spread
confusion
and
dismay
through
the
pastor
heart
and
family
and
what
was
to
become
of
herself
with
clarence
on
her
hands
who
could
do
nothing
that
was
useful
and
could
earn
neither
his
own
living
nor
hers
all
this
was
very
terrible
to
phoebe
and
for
a
moment
she
contemplated
the
unheard
of
step
of
having
a
headache
and
staying
upstairs
but
she
reflected
that
her
poor
old
grandfather
had
done
duty
at
no
small
sacrifice
according
to
her
bidding
yesterday
and
she
bathed
her
eyes
heroically
and
collected
her
strength
and
went
down
to
breakfast
as
usual
it
was
her
duty
which
she
must
do
as
for
copperhead
he
took
a
long
walk
to
reflect
upon
all
the
circumstances
which
were
complicated
enough
to
cause
him
much
trouble
he
could
not
give
up
his
cherished
scheme
his
member
of
parliament
his
crown
of
glory
it
was
what
he
had
been
looking
forward
to
for
years
he
tried
to
realize
the
failure
of
his
hopes
and
could
not
nay
would
not
feeling
it
more
than
he
could
bear
no
without
his
gentleman
son
his
university
man
his
costly
useless
production
who
was
worth
so
much
money
to
him
yet
brought
in
nothing
he
felt
that
he
must
shrink
in
the
opinion
of
all
his
friends
even
of
his
own
sons
the
first
family
who
had
so
envied
sneered
at
undervalued
clarence
yet
had
been
forced
to
be
civil
to
him
and
respect
their
father
imperious
will
as
he
chose
that
it
should
be
respected
what
a
sorry
figure
he
should
cut
before
all
of
them
if
he
cast
off
clarence
and
had
to
announce
himself
publicly
as
foiled
in
all
his
plans
and
hopes
he
could
not
face
this
prospect
he
shrank
from
it
as
if
it
had
involved
actual
bodily
pain
the
men
who
would
laugh
at
his
failure
were
men
of
his
own
class
to
whom
he
had
bragged
at
his
ease
crowing
and
exulting
over
them
and
he
felt
that
he
could
not
face
them
if
all
his
grand
anticipations
collapsed
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
give
in
and
on
the
other
hand
this
girl
phoebe
was
a
very
clever
girl
able
not
only
to
save
the
expense
of
coaches
but
to
cram
the
boy
and
keep
him
up
better
than
any
coach
could
do
she
could
make
his
speeches
for
him
like
enough
copperhead
thought
and
a
great
many
reasons
might
be
given
to
the
world
why
she
had
been
chosen
instead
of
a
richer
wife
for
the
golden
boy
golden
girls
as
a
general
rule
were
not
of
so
much
use
fortune
ai
worth
thinking
of
in
comparison
with
brains
it
was
brains
i
wanted
and
i
bought
dear
but
i
hope
i
can
afford
it
he
almost
heard
himself
saying
to
an
admiring
envious
assembly
for
copperhead
so
far
deserved
his
success
that
he
could
accept
a
defeat
when
it
was
necessary
and
make
the
best
of
it
when
he
had
nearly
ended
his
walk
and
had
reached
in
his
thoughts
to
this
point
he
met
his
son
who
was
walking
up
from
the
parsonage
to
no
in
the
lane
clarence
looked
cheerful
enough
as
he
walked
along
whistling
under
his
breath
towards
his
love
but
when
he
saw
his
father
a
change
came
over
his
face
once
more
his
eyelids
drooped
over
his
eyes
and
those
muddy
brown
orbs
got
fixed
in
dull
obstinacy
once
more
his
upper
lip
shut
down
sullen
and
fast
upon
the
lower
the
entire
expression
of
his
face
changed
copperhead
saw
this
afar
off
from
the
moment
his
son
perceived
him
and
the
sight
gave
to
all
his
thinking
that
force
which
reality
gives
to
imagination
the
risk
he
was
running
became
doubly
clear
good
morning
clarence
he
said
good
morning
sir
responded
the
other
with
lowering
brows
and
mouth
i
suppose
you
were
coming
to
the
george
to
me
come
along
i
had
no
breakfast
and
let
hope
my
boy
that
you
in
a
better
mind
than
last
night
look
here
sir
said
clarence
you
might
as
well
ask
one
of
those
houses
to
walk
with
you
to
the
george
and
show
a
better
mind
i
of
one
mind
and
one
only
i
marry
phoebe
beecham
whether
you
like
it
or
not
and
no
other
woman
in
this
world
is
that
your
last
word
said
the
father
curiously
repeating
without
being
aware
of
it
his
question
of
the
previous
night
that
my
last
word
said
the
son
contemplating
his
father
sullenly
from
under
the
heavy
lids
of
his
obstinate
eyes
very
well
said
copperhead
then
come
along
to
breakfast
for
hungry
and
we
can
talk
it
over
there
chapter
xlv
the
last
this
is
how
phoebe
difficulties
ended
contrary
to
her
every
expectation
copperhead
made
a
great
brag
of
her
powers
wherever
he
went
money
is
money
he
said
but
brains
is
brains
all
the
same
we
ca
get
on
without
and
when
you
want
to
make
a
figure
in
the
world
sir
buy
a
few
brains
if
they
fall
in
your
way
that
my
style
i
done
with
stupid
ones
up
till
now
but
when
i
see
there
a
want
of
a
clever
one
i
ai
such
a
fool
as
to
shut
my
eyes
to
it
they
cost
dear
but
i
thankful
to
say
i
can
afford
that
ay
and
a
good
deal
more
thus
everything
was
satisfactorily
arranged
tozer
and
his
wife
cried
together
for
joy
on
the
but
they
did
not
expect
to
be
asked
to
that
ceremony
being
well
aware
that
phoebe
having
now
completely
entered
into
the
regions
of
the
great
could
not
be
expected
to
have
very
much
to
say
to
them
though
i
know
the
darling
as
just
be
the
same
if
she
was
here
and
would
let
nobody
look
down
upon
you
and
me
said
the
old
woman
she
a
wonderful
girl
she
is
said
old
tozer
wind
us
all
round
her
little
finger
that
what
she
could
do
leastways
except
when
there
was
principle
in
it
and
there
i
stood
firm
but
i
done
things
for
phoebe
as
i
would
have
done
for
no
other
breathing
and
she
knew
it
i
would
give
in
to
her
tho
about
church
folks
being
just
as
good
as
them
as
is
more
enlightened
that
agin
reason
but
i
done
things
for
along
of
her
ah
she
a
wonderful
girl
is
phoebe
phoebe
junior
as
i
always
call
her
there
ai
her
match
between
here
and
london
and
that
what
i
always
say
but
we
will
not
try
to
describe
the
glory
and
joy
that
filled
beecham
house
in
the
terrace
when
clarence
copperhead
went
back
there
with
all
their
friends
to
the
which
was
in
the
very
best
style
and
regardless
of
expense
even
at
that
moment
it
gave
phoebe
a
little
pang
to
see
her
mother
in
the
bright
colours
which
she
loved
but
which
made
her
so
much
pinker
and
fatter
than
was
needful
little
copperhead
in
dim
neutral
tints
looked
like
a
little
shadow
beside
the
pastor
buxom
wife
and
was
frightened
and
ill
at
ease
and
sad
to
the
heart
to
lose
her
boy
who
had
been
all
she
possessed
in
the
world
sophy
dorset
specially
asked
for
the
purpose
with
ursula
may
who
was
a
bridesmaid
looked
on
with
much
admiration
at
the
curious
people
so
rich
so
fine
and
so
overwhelming
among
whom
her
father
had
found
it
so
remarkable
to
meet
not
one
person
whom
he
knew
now
ursula
she
said
if
you
had
played
your
cards
properly
that
beautiful
bridegroom
and
that
nice
little
house
in
mayfair
and
the
privilege
perhaps
of
writing
after
your
name
some
time
or
other
might
all
have
been
yours
instead
of
miss
beecham
why
did
you
let
her
carry
off
the
prize
cousin
sophy
cried
ursula
indignantly
as
if
i
ever
thought
of
him
as
a
prize
but
i
know
you
are
only
laughing
at
me
the
strange
thing
is
that
she
likes
him
though
i
am
sure
she
knew
very
well
that
reginald
oh
when
one
thinks
how
many
people
there
are
in
this
world
who
do
not
get
what
they
wish
most
and
how
many
people
there
are
ursula
paused
involved
in
her
own
antithesis
and
sophy
ended
it
for
her
with
a
sigh
who
do
and
the
one
is
no
happier
than
the
other
most
times
little
ursula
but
you
do
understand
that
and
as
you
are
going
to
be
one
of
the
blessed
ones
you
need
not
take
to
making
reflections
that
is
my
privilege
my
dear
oh
cousin
sophy
why
were
not
you
one
of
those
blessed
ones
too
cried
ursula
clasping
her
arms
suddenly
round
her
kind
friend
this
be
it
understood
was
after
the
breakfast
was
over
and
when
in
the
deep
gloom
which
generally
concludes
a
wedding
day
everybody
had
gone
home
the
two
were
in
a
magnificent
large
bedchamber
in
portland
place
in
the
vast
silent
mansion
of
the
copperheads
where
at
present
there
was
nothing
more
cheerful
than
the
bridegroom
mother
taking
herself
dreadfully
to
task
for
not
being
happy
and
trying
not
to
cry
though
there
was
to
be
a
great
dinner
and
entertainment
that
night
do
you
know
said
sophy
putting
her
aside
with
a
certain
proud
coldness
and
a
momentary
laugh
he
i
loved
proved
false
that
is
to
say
in
simple
language
he
turned
out
so
poor
a
creature
that
it
is
very
good
of
me
not
to
despise
humanity
for
his
sweet
sake
never
mind
if
all
had
gone
well
and
he
had
been
a
real
man
instead
of
the
sham
image
of
one
i
do
suppose
i
should
have
ever
been
among
the
blessed
ones
anne
is
who
never
thought
of
such
mysteries
at
all
and
so
you
will
be
my
little
ursula
very
happy
i
am
sure
of
it
though
how
you
can
manage
to
be
happy
my
dear
marrying
a
man
who
is
not
a
good
churchman
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
cousin
sophy
have
i
been
brought
up
in
a
way
to
make
me
so
fond
of
churchmen
said
ursula
solemnly
she
could
not
have
told
how
much
or
how
little
she
knew
about
her
father
behaviour
and
the
shock
to
his
mental
system
but
vaguely
and
by
instinct
there
was
a
great
deal
that
she
did
know
you
have
been
behind
the
scenes
too
much
perhaps
said
sophy
dorset
shrugging
her
shoulders
but
do
think
any
worse
of
the
world
than
you
ought
if
you
ca
think
very
much
better
no
class
is
good
or
bad
ursula
men
are
but
men
all
over
the
world
this
made
ursula
cry
though
it
is
difficult
to
say
why
she
thought
it
cynical
and
probably
so
will
the
reader
perhaps
sophy
dorset
abandoned
the
cause
of
mankind
too
easily
as
most
people
of
her
temperament
and
age
are
disposed
to
do
anyhow
the
evening
entertainment
took
place
and
was
very
fine
and
every
honour
was
done
to
clarence
marriage
especially
by
his
mother
who
appeared
in
the
most
lovely
satin
that
eyes
ever
saw
and
diamonds
and
almost
succeeded
all
the
evening
in
keeping
herself
from
crying
but
not
entirely
she
did
break
down
when
the
health
of
bridegroom
and
bride
was
drunk
as
it
ought
to
be
but
recovered
herself
hastily
when
the
mother
on
the
other
side
gave
her
a
kiss
of
sympathy
though
it
was
an
honest
kiss
it
filled
poor
little
copperhead
mind
with
the
most
unchristian
feelings
and
gave
her
strength
to
keep
up
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
and
do
her
duty
to
the
last
nevertheless
phoebe
was
the
best
of
and
ended
by
making
her
husband
mother
dependent
on
her
for
most
of
the
comforts
of
her
life
and
clarence
got
into
parliament
and
the
reader
perhaps
if
parliament
is
sitting
may
have
had
the
luck
to
read
a
speech
in
the
morning
paper
of
phoebe
composition
and
if
he
ever
got
the
secret
of
her
style
would
know
it
again
and
might
trace
the
course
of
a
public
character
for
years
to
come
by
that
means
but
this
secret
is
one
which
no
bribe
nor
worldly
inducement
will
ever
tempt
our
lips
to
betray
northcote
was
released
from
the
charge
of
salem
chapel
directly
after
these
events
by
the
return
of
the
minister
safe
and
sound
from
his
holiday
to
the
great
delight
of
the
congregation
though
they
had
not
been
very
fond
of
their
old
pastor
before
now
they
could
not
sufficiently
exult
over
the
happy
the
other
one
never
crossed
our
doors
from
the
day
he
came
till
now
as
he
going
away
said
one
indignant
member
nor
took
no
more
notice
of
us
chapel
folks
nor
if
we
were
dirt
beneath
his
feet
that
time
as
the
meeting
was
held
when
he
spoke
up
again
the
sinecure
was
the
only
time
as
my
mind
was
satisfied
cried
another
and
a
deal
came
of
it
after
making
friends
with
the
very
man
he
had
abused
all
his
friends
was
church
folks
said
a
third
he
was
a
wolf
in
sheep
clothing
that
what
i
calls
him
and
a
poor
moralist
as
a
preacher
with
never
a
rousing
word
in
them
things
as
he
called
his
sermons
we
well
rid
of
the
likes
of
him
though
he
may
be
clever
i
do
give
much
for
that
kind
of
cleverness
and
what
the
good
of
you
minister
or
not
minister
if
you
ca
keep
consistent
and
stick
to
your
own
side
the
chorus
was
so
strong
that
the
echo
of
it
moved
tozer
who
was
a
kind
of
and
leading
member
too
in
his
way
where
he
sat
twiddling
his
thumbs
in
his
little
room
i
one
as
is
qualified
to
give
what
you
may
call
a
casting
vote
said
tozer
being
the
oldest
deacon
in
salem
and
one
as
has
seen
generations
coming
and
going
and
as
for
church
and
chapel
i
served
both
and
seen
the
colour
of
their
money
and
them
as
has
their
obligations
to
me
though
we
need
name
no
names
but
this
i
will
say
as
i
cured
of
clever
men
and
them
as
is
thought
superior
they
ai
to
be
calculated
upon
if
any
more
o
them
young
intellectuals
turns
up
at
carlingford
i
tell
him
right
out
ai
the
man
for
my
money
i
say
to
him
as
bold
as
brass
been
young
and
now
i
old
and
it
my
conviction
as
clever
young
men
ai
the
sort
for
salem
we
want
them
as
is
and
them
as
is
consistent
good
strong
opinions
and
none
o
your
charity
what
we
wants
here
now
tozer
had
loved
clever
young
men
in
his
day
more
well
than
wisely
as
everybody
knew
and
this
deliverance
carried
all
the
more
weight
in
consequence
and
was
echoed
loudly
by
one
general
hum
of
content
and
applause
northcote
took
this
very
quietly
but
he
retired
after
he
had
married
ursula
from
the
office
of
pastor
for
which
he
was
not
fitted
and
from
the
liberation
society
and
various
other
societies
coming
to
see
that
disestablishment
was
not
a
panacea
for
national
evils
any
more
than
other
things
he
was
in
the
habit
of
quoting
his
reginald
may
as
the
best
man
he
knew
but
this
did
not
make
him
a
churchman
for
naturally
he
could
not
say
the
same
of
other
members
of
the
same
class
and
family
he
was
shaken
out
of
his
strong
opinions
but
it
is
doubtful
how
far
this
was
good
for
him
for
he
was
a
man
of
warlike
disposition
and
not
to
have
something
which
he
could
go
to
the
stake
for
something
which
he
could
think
the
devil
own
stronghold
to
assail
was
a
drawback
to
him
and
cramped
his
mental
development
but
he
was
happy
in
his
home
with
his
pretty
ursula
which
is
probably
all
the
reader
will
care
to
know
he
paid
tozer
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
he
made
no
inquiries
and
tried
not
to
ask
himself
what
all
that
strange
scene
had
meant
and
whatever
it
did
mean
it
was
over
for
ever
and
nobody
asked
any
further
questions
or
made
any
revelations
on
the
subject
as
for
may
his
mysterious
illness
went
on
for
some
time
the
doctors
never
venturing
to
put
any
name
to
it
it
was
mental
shock
and
perhaps
aberration
though
he
was
sane
enough
to
calm
down
after
that
incomprehensible
scene
simpson
of
the
bank
had
a
good
guess
at
the
secret
of
the
enigma
but
even
tozer
got
hazy
about
it
after
a
while
and
though
he
knew
that
he
had
done
may
a
wonderful
service
could
scarcely
have
told
what
it
was
and
neither
when
it
was
all
over
could
the
culprit
have
told
he
got
better
and
worse
for
about
a
year
and
then
he
died
his
strength
failing
him
without
any
distinct
reason
no
one
could
tell
how
reginald
got
the
living
and
stepped
into
his
father
place
making
a
home
for
the
children
which
sharp
janey
rules
over
not
so
softly
or
steadily
as
ursula
with
a
love
of
theories
and
experiments
not
quite
consistent
with
the
higher
graces
of
housekeeping
yet
with
an
honest
meaning
through
it
all
as
the
times
are
so
unsettled
and
no
one
can
tell
what
may
become
within
a
year
of
any
old
foundation
the
trustees
have
requested
reginald
to
retain
his
chaplaincy
at
the
old
college
so
that
he
is
in
reality
a
pluralist
and
almost
rich
though
they
say
the
man
in
carlingford
he
has
his
vagaries
too
which
no
man
can
live
without
but
he
is
the
kindest
guardian
to
his
brothers
and
sisters
and
bears
with
freaks
with
exemplary
gentleness
and
he
has
a
curate
whom
in
the
course
of
nature
janey
will
probably
marry
though
this
has
not
yet
been
revealed
to
either
party
who
have
reached
only
the
first
stage
of
hating
each
other
up
to
this
time
it
is
not
thought
in
the
family
that
reginald
will
ever
marry
she
was
never
worthy
of
him
the
sisters
say
but
he
thinks
differently
as
yet
at
least
however
he
is
young
and
things
may
mend
the
end
