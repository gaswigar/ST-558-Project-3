a
thousand
and
one
afternoons
in
chicago
by
ben
hecht
preface
it
was
a
day
in
the
spring
of
dismal
shadows
really
hechtian
shadows
filled
the
editorial
coop
in
chicago
daily
building
outside
the
rain
was
slanting
down
in
the
way
that
hecht
own
rain
always
slants
in
walked
hecht
he
had
been
divorced
from
our
staff
for
some
weeks
and
had
married
an
overdressed
blatant
creature
called
publicity
well
and
how
did
he
like
publicity
the
answer
was
written
in
his
sullen
eyes
it
was
written
on
his
furrowed
brow
and
in
the
savage
way
he
stabbed
the
costly
furniture
with
his
cane
the
alliance
with
publicity
was
an
unhappy
one
good
pay
oh
yes
preposterous
pay
luncheons
with
prominent
persons
limitless
luncheons
easy
work
short
hours
plenteous
taxis
hustling
associates
glittering
results
but
but
he
could
stand
it
that
was
all
he
just
unaccountably
illogically
and
damnably
could
stand
it
if
he
had
to
attend
another
luncheon
and
eat
and
peach
melba
and
listen
to
some
orator
pronounce
a
speech
he
hecht
had
written
and
hear
some
magnate
outline
a
campaign
which
he
hecht
had
invented
and
that
was
all
either
gentlemen
he
just
could
stand
it
well
the
old
job
was
open
ben
shuddered
it
was
the
old
job
that
he
was
thinking
about
he
had
a
new
idea
something
different
maybe
impossible
and
here
followed
specifications
for
one
thousand
and
one
afternoons
the
title
i
believe
came
later
along
with
details
like
the
salary
hang
the
salary
i
doubt
if
ben
even
heard
the
figure
that
was
named
he
merely
said
and
proceeded
to
embellish
his
dream
his
dream
of
a
department
more
brilliant
more
artistic
truer
i
think
he
said
truer
broader
and
better
than
anything
in
the
american
press
a
literary
thriller
a
and
so
on
so
much
for
the
mercenary
spirit
in
which
one
thousand
and
one
afternoons
was
conceived
a
week
or
so
later
ben
came
in
again
bringing
actual
manuscript
for
eight
or
ten
stories
he
was
haggard
but
very
happy
it
was
clear
that
he
had
sat
up
nights
with
those
stories
he
thumbed
them
over
as
though
he
hated
to
let
them
go
they
were
the
first
fruits
of
his
big
idea
the
idea
that
just
under
the
edge
of
the
news
as
commonly
understood
the
news
often
flatly
and
unimaginatively
told
lay
life
that
in
this
urban
life
there
dwelt
the
stuff
of
literature
not
hidden
in
remote
places
either
but
walking
the
downtown
streets
peering
from
the
windows
of
sky
scrapers
sunning
itself
in
parks
and
boulevards
he
was
going
to
be
its
interpreter
his
was
to
be
the
lens
throwing
city
life
into
new
colors
his
the
microscope
revealing
its
contortions
in
life
and
death
it
was
no
newspaper
dream
at
all
in
fact
it
was
an
artist
dream
and
it
had
begun
to
come
true
here
were
the
stories
hoped
i
like
one
thousand
and
one
afternoons
were
launched
in
june
they
were
presented
to
the
public
as
journalism
extraordinary
journalism
that
invaded
the
realm
of
literature
where
in
large
part
journalism
really
dwells
they
went
out
backed
by
confidence
in
the
genius
of
ben
hecht
this
if
you
please
took
place
three
months
before
the
publication
of
erik
dorn
when
not
a
few
critics
discovered
hecht
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
first
full
release
of
hecht
literary
powers
was
in
one
thousand
and
one
afternoons
the
sketches
themselves
reveal
his
creative
delight
in
them
they
ring
with
the
happiness
of
a
spirit
at
last
free
to
tell
what
it
feels
they
teem
with
thought
and
impressions
long
treasured
they
are
a
recital
of
songs
echoing
the
voices
of
ben
own
city
and
performed
with
a
virtuosity
granted
to
him
alone
they
announced
to
a
chicago
audience
which
only
half
understood
them
the
arrival
of
a
prodigy
whose
precise
significance
is
still
unmeasured
erik
dorn
was
published
gargoyles
took
form
hecht
wrote
a
play
in
eight
days
he
experimented
with
a
long
manuscript
to
be
begun
and
finished
within
eighteen
hours
one
thousand
and
one
afternoons
continued
to
pour
out
of
him
his
became
too
small
for
his
mail
he
was
bombarded
with
eulogies
complaints
arguments
tips
and
solicitations
his
clipping
bureau
rained
upon
him
violent
reviews
of
dorn
his
publishers
submerged
him
with
appeals
for
manuscript
syndicates
wired
him
with
name
your
own
terms
new
york
editors
tried
to
steal
him
he
continued
to
write
one
thousand
and
one
afternoons
he
became
weary
nervous
and
bilious
he
spent
four
days
in
bed
and
gave
up
tobacco
nothing
stopped
one
thousand
and
one
afternoons
one
a
day
one
a
day
did
the
flesh
fail
and
topics
give
out
and
the
typewriter
became
an
enemy
no
matter
the
venturesome
undertaking
of
writing
good
newspaper
sketches
one
per
diem
had
to
be
carried
out
we
wondered
how
he
did
it
we
saw
him
in
moods
when
he
almost
surrendered
when
the
strain
of
juggling
with
novels
plays
and
with
contracts
revises
adblurbs
sketches
nearly
finished
one
thousand
and
one
afternoon
but
a
year
went
by
and
through
all
that
year
there
had
not
been
an
issue
of
chicago
daily
without
a
ben
hecht
sketch
and
still
the
manuscripts
dropped
down
regularly
on
the
editor
desk
comedies
dialogues
homilies
tragedies
storiettes
sepia
panels
satires
fugues
bourrees
something
different
every
day
rarely
anything
hopelessly
out
of
key
stories
seemingly
born
out
of
nothing
and
written
to
judge
by
the
typing
in
ten
minutes
but
in
reality
as
a
rule
based
upon
actual
incident
developed
by
a
period
of
soaking
in
the
peculiar
chemicals
of
ben
nature
and
written
with
much
sophistication
in
the
choice
of
words
there
were
dramatic
studies
often
intensely
subjective
lit
with
the
moods
of
ben
himself
not
of
the
things
dramatized
there
were
characteristically
frank
and
provokingly
debonaire
there
was
comment
upon
everything
under
the
sun
assaults
upon
all
the
idols
of
antiquity
of
mediaevalism
of
there
were
raw
chunks
of
philosophy
delivered
with
gusto
and
sometimes
with
inaccuracy
there
were
subtle
jabs
at
babbitry
and
besides
of
the
thousand
and
one
hechts
visible
in
the
sketches
there
were
several
that
appear
rarely
if
at
all
in
his
novels
the
whimsical
hecht
sailing
jocosely
on
the
surface
of
life
the
witty
hecht
flinging
out
novel
slang
and
snappy
endings
hecht
the
and
with
a
special
tenderness
for
dogs
hecht
the
sympathetic
betraying
his
pity
for
the
aged
the
forgotten
the
forlorn
in
the
novels
he
is
one
of
his
selves
in
the
sketches
he
is
many
of
them
perhaps
this
is
why
he
officially
spoke
slightingly
of
them
at
times
why
he
walked
in
some
days
flung
down
a
manuscript
and
said
here
a
rotten
story
yet
it
must
be
that
he
found
pleasure
in
playing
the
whole
scale
in
hopping
from
the
to
the
in
surprising
his
public
each
day
with
a
new
whim
or
a
recently
discovered
broken
image
i
suspect
anyhow
that
he
delighted
in
making
his
editor
stare
and
fumble
in
the
dictionary
of
taboos
ben
will
deny
most
of
this
he
denies
everything
it
does
matter
it
does
even
matter
much
ben
that
your
typing
was
sometimes
so
blind
or
that
your
spelling
was
occasionally
atrocious
or
that
it
took
three
and
a
library
of
universal
knowledge
to
check
up
your
historical
allusions
the
preface
is
proving
horribly
inadequate
it
is
not
at
all
what
ben
wants
it
does
not
seem
possible
to
support
his
theory
that
one
thousand
and
one
afternoons
springing
from
a
literary
passion
so
authentic
and
continuing
so
long
with
a
fervor
and
variety
unmatched
in
newspaper
writing
are
done
for
a
meal
ticket
they
must
have
had
the
momentum
of
a
strictly
artistic
inspiration
and
gained
further
momentum
from
the
need
of
expression
from
pride
in
the
subtle
use
of
words
from
an
ardent
interest
in
the
city
and
its
human
types
yes
they
are
newspaper
work
they
are
the
writings
of
a
reporter
emancipated
from
the
assignment
book
and
the
a
reporter
gone
to
the
heaven
of
reporters
where
they
write
what
they
jolly
well
please
and
get
it
printed
too
but
the
sketches
are
also
literature
of
which
i
think
ben
can
not
be
altogether
ashamed
else
why
does
he
print
them
in
a
book
and
how
could
rosse
be
moved
to
make
the
striking
designs
with
which
the
book
is
embellished
quite
enough
has
been
said
the
author
the
newspaper
editor
the
and
revisers
have
done
their
utmost
with
one
thousand
and
one
afternoons
the
prefacer
confesses
failure
it
is
the
turn
of
the
reader
he
may
welcome
the
sketches
in
book
form
he
may
turn
scornfully
from
them
and
leave
them
to
moulder
in
the
of
to
paraphrase
an
old
comic
opera
lyric
you
never
can
tell
about
a
reader
perhaps
that
why
we
think
them
all
so
nice
you
never
find
two
alike
at
any
one
time
and
you
never
find
one
alike
twice
you
never
very
certain
that
they
read
you
and
you
often
very
certain
that
they
do
though
an
author
fancy
still
that
he
has
the
strongest
will
it
the
reader
has
the
strongest
wo
yet
i
think
that
the
book
will
succeed
it
may
succeed
so
far
that
hecht
will
hear
some
brazen
idiots
remarking
i
like
it
better
than
or
yes
just
that
ruinous
thing
may
happen

the

the

would
like
to
help
her
the
judge
says
now
fanny
tell
me
all
about
it
all
about
it
all
about
it
fanny
stoical
face
stares
at
the
floor
if
fanny
had
words
but
fanny
has
no
words
something
heavy
in
her
heart
something
vague
and
heavy
in
her
thought
these
are
all
that
fanny
has
let
the
policewoman
records
show
three
years
ago
fanny
came
to
chicago
from
a
place
called
plano
and
and
like
an
ear
of
ripe
corn
dropped
in
the
middle
of
state
and
madison
streets
fanny
came
to
the
city
ah
the
lonely
city
with
its
crowds
and
its
lonely
lights
the
lonely
buildings
busy
with
a
thousand
lonelinesses
people
laughing
and
hurrying
along
people
for
something
summer
parks
and
streets
white
with
snow
the
city
moon
like
a
distant
window
pretty
gewgaws
in
the
stores
these
are
a
part
of
fanny
story
the
judge
wants
to
know
fanny
eyes
look
up
a
dog
takes
a
kick
like
this
with
eyes
like
this
large
dumb
and
brimming
with
pathos
the
master
is
a
mysterious
and
inexplicable
dispenser
of
joys
and
sorrows
his
caresses
and
his
beatings
are
alike
mysterious
their
reasons
seldom
to
be
discerned
never
fully
understood
sometimes
in
this
court
where
the
sinners
are
haled
where
poised
and
prim
and
particular
society
stately
sits
his
honor
has
a
moment
of
confusion
eyes
lift
themselves
to
him
eyes
dumb
and
brimming
with
pathos
eyes
stare
out
of
sordid
faces
evil
faces
wasted
faces
and
say
something
not
admissible
as
evidence
eyes
say
i
do
know
i
know
what
is
it
all
about
these
are
not
to
be
confused
with
the
eyes
that
plead
shrewdly
for
mercy
with
eyes
that
feign
dramatic
naïvetés
and
offer
themselves
like
primping
little
penitents
to
his
honor
his
honor
knows
them
fairly
well
and
understands
them
they
are
eyes
still
bargaining
with
life
but
fanny
eyes
yes
the
judge
would
like
to
know
a
vagueness
comes
into
his
precise
mind
he
the
familiar
accusation
that
the
policeman
drones
a
terribly
drone
another
raid
on
a
suspected
flat
routine
routine
evil
has
its
eternal
root
in
the
cities
a
tireless
satan
bored
with
the
monotony
of
his
rôle
a
tireless
justice
bored
with
the
routine
of
tears
and
pleadings
lies
and
guilt
there
is
no
story
in
all
this
once
his
honor
walking
home
from
a
banquet
looked
up
and
noticed
the
stars
meaningless
immutable
stars
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
by
looking
at
them
they
were
mysteries
to
be
dismissed
like
the
mystery
of
fanny
eyes
meaningless
immutable
eyes
they
do
not
bargain
yet
the
world
stares
out
of
them
the
face
looks
dumbly
up
at
a
judge
no
defense
the
policeman
drone
has
ended
and
fanny
says
nothing
this
is
difficult
because
his
honor
knows
suddenly
there
is
a
defense
a
monstrous
defense
since
there
are
always
two
sides
to
everything
yes
what
is
the
other
side
his
honor
would
like
to
know
tell
it
fanny
about
the
crowds
streets
buildings
lights
about
the
whirligig
of
loneliness
about
the
clutter
of
longings
and
then
explain
about
the
summer
parks
and
the
white
snow
and
the
moon
window
in
the
sky
throw
in
a
poignantly
ironical
dissertation
on
life
on
its
uncharted
aimlessness
and
speak
like
sherwood
anderson
about
the
desires
that
stir
in
the
heart
speak
like
remy
de
gourmont
and
dostoevsky
and
stevie
crane
like
schopenhauer
and
dreiser
and
isaiah
speak
like
all
the
great
questioners
whose
tongues
have
wagged
and
whose
hearts
have
burned
with
questions
his
honor
will
listen
bewilderedly
and
perhaps
only
perhaps
understand
for
a
moment
the
dumb
pathos
of
your
eyes
as
it
is
you
were
found
as
the
copper
who
reads
the
newspapers
puts
it
in
a
suspected
flat
a
violation
of
section
of
the
city
code
thirty
days
in
the
bastile
fanny
unless
his
honor
is
feeling
good
these
eyes
lifted
to
him
will
ask
him
questions
on
his
way
home
from
a
banquet
some
night
how
old
are
you
twenty
make
it
his
honor
smiles
and
you
have
nothing
to
say
about
how
you
happened
to
get
into
this
sort
of
thing
you
look
like
a
good
girl
although
looks
are
often
deceiving
i
went
there
with
him
says
fanny
and
she
points
to
a
citizen
with
an
unshaven
face
a
quaint
don
juan
indeed
ever
see
him
before
a
shake
of
the
head
plain
case
and
yet
his
honor
hesitates
his
honor
feels
something
expand
in
his
breast
perhaps
he
would
like
to
rise
and
holding
forth
his
hand
utter
a
famous
plagiarism
go
and
sin
no
more
he
chews
a
pen
and
sighs
instead
i
give
you
another
chance
he
says
the
next
time
it
be
jail
keep
this
in
mind
if
you
brought
in
again
no
excuses
will
go
call
the
next
case
now
one
can
follow
fanny
she
walks
out
of
the
courtroom
the
street
swallows
her
nobody
in
the
crowds
knows
what
has
happened
fanny
is
anybody
now
still
one
may
follow
perhaps
something
will
reveal
itself
something
will
add
an
illuminating
touch
to
the
incident
of
the
courtroom
there
is
only
this
fanny
pauses
in
front
of
a
window
the
crowds
clutter
by
fanny
stands
looking
without
interest
into
the
window
there
is
a
little
mirror
inside
the
city
tumbles
by
the
city
is
interested
in
something
vastly
complicated
staring
into
the
little
mirror
fanny
sighs
and
powders
her
nose
the
auctioneer
wife
an
auctioneer
must
have
a
compelling
manner
he
must
be
gabby
and
stentorian
witheringly
sarcastic
and
plaintively
cajoling
he
must
be
able
to
detect
the
faintest
symptoms
of
avarice
and
desire
in
the
blink
of
an
eyelid
in
the
tilt
of
a
head
behind
his
of
patter
as
he
knocks
down
a
piece
of
useless
he
must
be
able
to
remain
cool
remain
calculating
remain
like
a
hawk
prepared
to
pounce
upon
his
prey
passion
for
him
must
be
no
more
than
a
mask
anger
sorrow
despair
ecstasy
no
more
than
the
devices
of
salesmanship
but
more
than
all
this
an
auctioneer
must
know
the
magic
password
into
the
heart
of
the
professional
or
amateur
collector
he
must
know
the
glittering
phrases
that
are
the
keys
to
their
hobbies
the
words
that
bring
a
gleam
to
the
eye
of
the
oriental
rug
collector
the
words
that
fire
the
china
collector
the
stamp
collector
the
period
furniture
collector
the
tapestry
enthusiast
the
first
edition
fan
and
so
on
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
desire
your
expert
attention
for
a
moment
i
have
here
a
curious
little
thing
of
exquisite
workmanship
said
to
be
from
the
famous
collection
of
count
valentine
of
florence
this
delicately
molded
beautifully
painted
candelabra
has
illuminated
the
feasts
of
the
old
florentines
twinkled
amid
the
gay
courtly
rioting
of
a
time
that
is
no
more
before
the
bidding
for
this
priceless
souvenir
is
opened
i
desire
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
state
briefly
nathan
ludlow
is
an
auctioneer
who
knows
all
the
things
an
auctioneer
must
know
his
eye
is
piercing
his
tongue
can
roll
and
rattle
for
twelve
hours
at
a
stretch
his
voice
is
the
voice
of
the
tempter
and
irresistible
it
was
evening
an
auspicious
evening
it
was
the
evening
of
divorce
and
ludlow
sat
in
his
room
at
the
morrison
hotel
a
decanter
of
juniper
juice
at
his
elbow
and
while
he
sat
he
talked
the
subjects
varied
there
were
tales
of
ming
vases
and
satsuma
bargains
of
porcelains
and
rugs
and
finally
ludlow
arrived
at
the
subject
of
audiences
and
from
this
subject
he
progressed
with
the
aid
of
the
juniper
juice
to
the
subject
of
wives
and
from
the
subject
of
wives
he
stepped
casually
into
the
sad
story
of
his
life
i
tell
you
said
ludlow
tonight
i
a
free
man
judge
pam
gave
me
or
gave
her
rather
the
divorce
i
guess
he
did
well
maybe
she
was
entitled
to
it
desertion
and
cruelty
were
the
charges
but
they
mean
anything
the
chief
complaint
she
had
against
me
was
that
i
was
an
auctioneer
ludlow
sighed
and
ran
his
long
artist
fingers
over
his
eagle
features
and
brushed
back
a
byronic
lock
of
hair
from
his
forehead
it
was
four
years
ago
we
met
he
resumed
in
the
wabash
avenue
place
i
noticed
her
when
the
bidding
on
a
rocking
chair
started
a
pretty
girl
and
as
is
often
the
case
among
women
who
attend
auctions
a
bug
a
fan
a
fish
you
know
the
kind
that
stiffen
up
when
they
get
excited
the
kind
that
hang
on
your
words
and
breathe
hard
while
you
cut
loose
with
the
patter
and
lose
their
heads
when
you
swing
into
the
finale
well
she
did
get
the
rocking
chair
but
she
was
game
and
came
back
on
a
chinese
rug
i
began
to
notice
her
considerably
my
words
seemed
to
have
an
unusual
effect
on
her
then
i
could
see
that
she
was
not
only
the
kind
of
fish
that
lose
their
heads
at
auctions
but
the
terrible
kind
that
believe
everything
the
auctioneer
says
you
know
they
believe
that
the
oriental
rugs
really
came
from
the
harem
of
the
caliph
and
that
the
antique
bed
really
was
the
one
in
which
dubarry
slept
and
that
the
elizabethan
tablecloth
really
was
an
elizabethan
tablecloth
they
are
kind
of
goofily
romantic
and
they
fall
hard
for
everything
and
they
spend
their
last
penny
on
a
lot
of
truck
you
know
not
bad
stuff
and
probably
a
good
deal
more
useful
and
lasting
than
the
originals
would
have
been
ludlow
smiled
a
bit
apologetically
i
not
confessing
anything
you
do
know
i
hope
he
said
well
to
go
on
about
the
missus
i
knew
i
had
her
from
that
first
day
i
was
vitally
interested
but
when
she
returned
six
days
in
succession
it
got
kind
of
flattering
and
the
way
she
looked
at
me
and
listened
to
me
when
i
pulled
my
stuff
say
i
could
have
knocked
down
a
bouquet
of
paper
roses
for
the
original
wreath
worn
by
venus
i
felt
so
good
that
how
i
began
to
think
that
she
was
an
inspiration
to
me
and
how
i
figured
that
if
i
could
have
somebody
like
her
around
i
soon
have
them
all
pocketed
as
auctioneers
i
forget
just
how
it
was
we
met
but
we
did
and
i
swear
the
way
she
flattered
me
would
have
been
enough
to
turn
the
head
of
a
guy
ten
times
smarter
than
me
and
forty
times
as
old
so
we
got
married
that
skipping
a
lot
but
you
know
what
it
all
amount
to
the
courting
and
the
things
you
say
and
do
before
you
get
married
so
we
got
married
and
then
the
fun
started
at
first
i
could
hardly
believe
what
the
drift
of
it
was
but
i
hope
to
die
if
she
was
sincere
in
her
ideas
about
me
as
an
auctioneer
i
get
it
as
i
say
and
that
where
i
made
my
big
mistake
i
let
her
come
to
the
auctions
and
told
her
not
to
bid
but
when
i
start
my
patter
on
some
useless
piece
of
store
and
give
it
an
identity
and
hint
at
count
rudolph
collection
and
so
on
she
was
off
like
a
down
a
morning
track
i
did
know
how
to
fix
it
or
how
to
head
her
out
of
it
for
a
month
i
did
have
the
heart
to
disillusion
her
i
let
her
buy
damn
it
i
never
saw
such
an
absolute
boob
as
she
was
she
pick
out
the
most
worthless
junk
i
was
knocking
down
and
go
mad
over
it
and
buy
it
with
my
good
money
it
got
so
that
i
realized
i
was
slipping
i
get
a
promise
from
her
that
she
would
come
into
the
auction
but
i
never
could
be
sure
and
if
i
felt
like
cutting
loose
on
some
piece
of
junk
and
knocking
it
down
with
a
lot
of
flourishes
i
knew
sure
as
fate
that
the
missus
would
be
there
and
that
she
would
be
the
fish
that
caught
fire
first
and
most
and
that
i
be
selling
the
thing
to
myself
well
after
the
first
two
months
of
my
married
life
i
realized
that
have
to
talk
turkey
to
the
missus
she
was
costing
me
my
last
nickel
at
these
auctions
and
the
better
auctioneer
i
was
the
more
money
i
lost
on
account
of
her
being
so
susceptible
to
my
line
of
stuff
it
sounds
funny
but
it
a
fact
so
i
told
her
i
made
a
clean
breast
i
told
her
what
a
liar
i
was
and
how
all
the
stuff
i
pulled
from
the
auction
stand
was
the
bunk
and
how
she
was
a
boob
for
falling
for
it
and
so
on
and
so
on
say
i
sold
myself
to
her
as
the
world
greatest
all
around
low
down
hideous
liar
that
ever
walked
in
shoe
leather
and
that
how
it
started
this
divorce
today
is
kind
of
an
we
ai
had
much
to
do
with
each
other
ever
since
that
confession
ludlow
stared
sorrowfully
into
the
remains
of
a
glass
of
juniper
juice
i
never
marry
again
he
moaned
i
ai
the
kind
that
makes
a
good
husband
a
good
husband
is
a
man
who
is
just
an
ordinary
liar
and
me
well
i
an
auctioneer
fog
patterns
the
fog
tiptoes
into
the
streets
it
walks
like
a
great
cat
through
the
air
and
slowly
devours
the
city
the
office
buildings
vanish
leaving
behind
thin
pencil
lines
and
smoke
blurs
the
pavements
become
isolated
corridors
overhead
the
electric
signs
whisper
enigmatically
and
the
window
lights
dissolve
the
fog
thickens
till
the
city
disappears
high
up
where
the
mists
thin
into
a
dark
sulphurous
glow
roof
bubbles
float
the
great
cat
work
is
done
it
stands
balancing
itself
on
the
heads
of
people
and
arches
its
back
against
the
vanished
buildings
i
walk
along
thinking
about
the
way
the
streets
look
and
arranging
adjectives
in
my
mind
in
the
heavy
mist
people
appear
detached
they
no
longer
seem
to
belong
to
a
pursuit
in
common
usually
the
busy
part
of
the
city
is
like
the
exposed
mechanism
of
some
monstrous
clock
and
people
scurry
about
losing
themselves
in
cogs
and
springs
and
levers
but
now
the
monstrous
clock
is
almost
hidden
the
stores
and
offices
and
factories
that
form
the
mechanism
of
this
clock
are
buried
behind
the
fog
the
cat
has
eaten
them
up
hidden
within
the
mist
the
cogs
still
turn
and
the
springs
unwind
but
for
the
moment
they
seem
and
the
people
drifting
hurriedly
by
in
the
fog
seem
as
if
they
were
not
going
and
coming
from
stores
offices
and
factories
as
if
they
were
solitaries
hunting
something
in
the
labyrinths
of
the
fog
yes
we
are
all
lost
and
wandering
in
the
thick
mists
we
have
no
destinations
the
city
is
without
outlines
and
the
drift
of
figures
is
a
meaningless
thing
figures
that
are
going
nowhere
and
coming
from
nowhere
a
swarm
of
supernumeraries
who
are
not
in
the
play
who
saunter
dash
scurry
hesitate
in
search
of
a
part
in
the
play
this
is
a
curious
illusion
i
stop
and
listen
to
music
overhead
a
piano
is
playing
and
a
voice
singing
a
shop
above
monroe
and
state
streets
a
ballad
of
the
cheap
cabarets
yet
because
it
is
music
it
has
a
mystery
in
it
the
fog
pictures
grow
charming
there
is
an
idea
in
them
now
people
are
detached
little
decorations
etched
upon
a
mist
the
cat
has
eaten
up
the
monstrous
clock
and
people
have
rid
themselves
of
their
routine
which
was
to
tumble
and
scurry
among
its
cogs
and
levers
they
are
done
with
life
with
buying
and
selling
and
with
the
perpetual
errand
and
they
have
become
a
swarm
of
little
ornaments
men
and
women
denuded
of
the
city
their
outlines
posture
quaintly
in
the
mist
their
little
faces
say
the
clock
is
gone
there
is
nothing
any
more
to
make
us
alive
so
we
have
become
our
unconnected
selves
beside
me
in
the
fog
a
man
stands
next
to
a
tall
paper
rack
i
remember
that
this
is
the
rack
where
the
papers
are
on
sale
the
papers
are
rolled
up
and
thrust
like
rows
of
little
white
dolls
in
the
rack
i
wonder
that
this
should
be
a
newspaper
stand
it
looks
like
almost
anything
else
in
the
fog
a
pretty
girl
emerges
from
the
background
of
fog
she
talks
to
the
man
next
to
the
rack
have
you
a
des
moines
newspaper
she
asks
the
man
is
very
businesslike
he
fishes
out
a
newspaper
and
sells
it
at
the
sight
of
its
headlines
the
girl
eyes
light
up
it
is
as
if
she
had
met
a
very
close
friend
she
will
walk
along
feeling
comforted
now
chicago
is
a
stranger
its
buildings
and
streets
are
strangers
and
its
crowds
everywhere
are
worse
than
strangers
but
now
she
has
des
moines
under
her
arm
des
moines
is
a
companion
that
will
make
the
fog
seem
less
lonely
later
she
will
sit
down
in
a
hotel
room
and
read
of
what
has
happened
in
des
moines
buildings
and
des
moines
streets
these
will
seem
like
real
happenings
whereas
the
happenings
that
the
chicago
papers
print
seem
like
unrealities
this
is
dearborn
street
now
dark
and
cozy
people
are
no
longer
decorations
but
intimate
friends
when
it
is
light
and
one
can
see
the
cogs
of
the
monstrous
clock
go
round
and
the
springs
unwind
one
thinks
of
people
as
a
part
of
this
mechanism
and
so
people
grow
vague
in
one
mind
and
unhuman
or
only
but
now
that
the
mechanism
is
gone
people
stand
out
with
an
insistent
humanness
people
sitting
on
stools
leaning
over
coffee
cups
people
standing
behind
store
counters
people
buying
cigars
and
people
walking
in
and
out
of
office
buildings
they
are
very
friendly
their
tired
faces
smile
or
at
least
look
somewhat
amused
and
interested
they
are
interested
in
the
fog
and
in
the
fact
that
one
can
not
see
three
feet
ahead
and
their
faces
say
to
each
other
here
we
are
all
alike
the
city
is
only
a
it
can
go
away
but
we
still
remain
we
are
much
more
important
than
the
big
buildings
i
hear
an
odd
tapping
sound
on
the
pavement
it
is
faint
but
growing
nearer
in
another
moment
a
man
tapping
on
the
pavement
with
a
cane
passes
a
blind
man
and
i
think
of
a
plot
for
a
fiction
story
if
a
terrible
murder
were
committed
in
a
marvelous
fog
that
hid
everything
the
chief
of
police
would
summon
a
blind
man
and
the
blind
man
could
track
the
murderer
down
in
the
fog
because
he
alone
would
be
able
to
move
in
the
thick
obliterating
mists
and
so
the
blind
man
with
his
cane
tapping
tapping
over
the
pavements
and
able
by
long
practice
to
move
without
sight
would
slowly
close
in
on
the
murderer
hemmed
in
by
darkness
a
newsboy
cries
from
the
depth
of
nowhere
paper
here
trains
crash
in
fog
paper
a
friend
and
i
sat
in
an
office
he
has
been
dictating
letters
but
he
stops
and
stares
out
of
the
window
his
eyes
grow
speculative
he
says
would
it
be
odd
if
it
were
always
like
this
i
think
i
like
it
better
would
you
but
i
suppose
they
invent
lights
able
to
penetrate
mist
and
the
town
would
be
as
garish
as
ever
in
a
few
years
but
i
like
the
fog
because
it
slows
things
up
things
are
too
damn
fast
to
suit
me
i
like
slow
like
they
used
to
be
a
century
ago
we
talk
and
my
friend
becomes
reminiscent
on
the
subject
of
stage
coaches
and
prairie
schooners
and
the
days
before
there
were
railroads
telephones
electricity
and
crowds
he
has
never
known
such
a
time
but
from
what
he
has
read
and
imagined
about
it
yes
it
would
be
better
when
i
come
out
it
is
the
fog
has
gone
the
city
has
popped
back
and
sprawls
triumphantly
into
space
for
a
moment
it
seems
as
if
the
city
had
sprung
up
in
an
hour
then
its
sturdy
walls
and
business
windows
begin
to
mock
at
the
memory
of
the
fog
in
my
mind
fogs
do
not
devour
us
they
say
we
are
the
ones
who
do
the
devouring
we
devour
fogs
and
people
and
days
marvelous
buildings
overhead
the
sky
floats
like
a
gray
and
white
balloon
as
if
it
were
a
toy
belonging
to
the
city
don
quixote
and
his
last
windmill
sherwood
anderson
the
writer
and
i
were
eating
lunch
in
the
back
room
of
a
saloon
against
the
opposite
wall
sat
a
little
man
with
an
elaborate
mustache
and
a
bald
head
and
a
happy
grin
he
sat
alone
at
a
tilted
round
table
and
played
with
a
plate
of
soup
say
that
old
boy
over
there
is
trying
to
wigwag
me
said
anderson
he
keeps
winking
and
making
signs
do
you
know
him
i
looked
and
said
no
the
waiter
appeared
with
a
box
of
cigars
sklarz
presents
his
compliments
said
the
waiter
smiling
who
sklarz
anderson
asked
helping
himself
to
a
cigar
the
waiter
indicated
the
little
man
him
he
whispered
we
continued
our
meal
both
of
us
watched
sklarz
casually
he
seemed
to
have
lost
interest
in
his
soup
he
sat
beaming
happily
at
the
walls
a
contagious
elation
about
him
we
smiled
and
nodded
our
thanks
for
the
cigars
whereupon
after
a
short
lapse
the
waiter
appeared
again
what
you
have
to
drink
gentlemen
the
waiter
inquired
nothing
said
anderson
knowing
i
was
broke
the
waiter
raised
his
continental
eyebrows
understandingly
sklarz
invites
you
gentlemen
to
drink
his
health
at
his
expense
two
glasses
anderson
ordered
they
were
brought
we
raised
them
in
silent
toast
to
the
little
man
he
arose
and
bowed
as
we
drank
we
probably
have
him
on
our
hands
now
for
an
hour
anderson
frowned
i
feared
the
same
but
sklarz
reseated
himself
and
with
many
head
bowings
in
our
direction
returned
to
his
soup
what
do
you
make
of
our
magnanimous
friend
i
asked
anderson
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
probably
celebrating
something
he
said
a
queer
old
boy
he
the
waiter
appeared
a
third
time
what
it
be
gentlemen
he
inquired
smiling
sklarz
is
buying
for
the
house
for
the
house
there
were
some
fifteen
men
eating
in
the
place
then
our
friend
despite
his
unassuming
appearance
was
evidently
a
creature
of
wealth
well
this
was
growing
interesting
we
ordered
wine
again
ask
sklarz
if
he
will
favor
us
by
joining
us
at
our
table
for
this
drink
i
told
the
waiter
the
message
was
delivered
sklarz
arose
and
bowed
but
sat
down
again
anderson
and
i
beckoned
in
pantomime
sklarz
arose
once
more
bowed
and
hesitated
then
he
came
over
as
he
approached
a
veritable
carnival
spirit
seemed
to
deepen
around
us
the
face
of
this
little
man
with
the
elaborate
black
mustache
was
violent
with
suppressed
good
will
and
mirth
he
beamed
bowed
shook
hands
and
sat
down
we
drank
one
another
health
and
as
politely
as
we
could
pressed
him
to
tell
us
the
cause
for
his
celebration
and
good
spirits
he
began
to
talk
he
was
a
russian
jew
his
name
was
sklarz
he
had
been
in
the
russian
army
years
ago
in
persia
from
a
mountain
in
persia
you
could
see
three
great
countries
in
turkey
he
had
fought
with
soldiers
and
at
night
joined
them
when
they
played
their
flutes
outside
the
and
sang
songs
about
women
and
war
then
he
had
come
to
america
and
opened
a
box
factory
he
was
very
prosperous
and
the
factory
in
which
he
made
boxes
grew
too
small
so
what
did
he
do
but
take
a
walk
one
day
to
look
for
a
larger
factory
and
he
found
a
beautiful
building
just
as
he
wanted
but
the
building
was
too
beautiful
to
use
for
a
factory
it
should
be
used
for
something
much
nicer
so
what
did
he
do
then
but
decide
to
open
a
a
magnificent
where
young
men
and
women
of
refined
temperaments
could
come
to
dance
and
have
fun
when
does
this
open
anderson
asked
ah
in
a
little
while
there
were
fittings
to
buy
and
put
up
first
but
he
would
send
us
special
invitations
to
the
opening
in
the
meantime
would
we
drink
his
health
again
sklarz
chuckled
the
amazing
thing
was
that
he
was
drunk
he
was
sober
so
you
celebrating
i
said
yes
he
was
celebrating
he
laughed
and
leaned
over
the
table
toward
us
his
eyes
danced
and
his
elaborate
mustache
made
a
grotesque
halo
for
his
smile
he
did
want
to
intrude
on
us
with
his
story
but
in
persia
and
turkey
and
the
urals
he
had
found
life
very
nice
and
here
in
chicago
he
had
found
life
also
very
nice
life
was
very
nice
wherever
you
went
and
anderson
quoted
rather
imperfectly
i
thought
oh
but
life
went
gayly
gayly
in
the
house
of
idah
dally
there
were
always
throats
to
sing
down
the
river
bank
with
spring
sklarz
beamed
yes
yes
he
said
down
the
river
benk
mit
spring
and
he
stood
up
and
bowed
and
summoned
the
waiter
see
vat
all
the
gentlemen
vant
he
ordered
and
give
them
vat
they
vant
mit
my
compliments
he
laughed
or
rather
chuckled
i
must
be
going
excuse
me
he
exclaimed
with
a
quick
little
bow
i
have
other
places
to
call
on
remember
me
sam
sklarz
be
good
and
do
forget
sam
sklarz
when
there
are
throats
to
zing
down
the
river
benk
mit
spring
we
watched
him
walk
out
his
shoulders
seemed
to
dance
his
short
legs
moved
with
a
sprightly
lift
a
queer
old
boy
said
anderson
we
talked
about
him
for
a
half
hour
and
then
left
the
place
anderson
called
me
up
the
next
morning
to
ask
if
i
had
read
about
it
in
the
paper
i
told
him
i
had
a
clipping
on
the
desk
in
front
of
me
ran
sam
sklarz
years
old
and
owner
of
a
box
factory
on
the
west
side
committed
suicide
early
this
morning
by
jumping
into
the
drainage
canal
financial
reverses
are
believed
to
have
caused
him
to
end
his
life
according
to
friends
he
was
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
his
liabilities
were
yesterday
morning
sklarz
cashed
a
check
for
which
represented
the
remains
of
his
bank
account
and
disappeared
it
is
believed
that
he
used
the
money
to
pay
a
few
personal
debts
and
then
wandered
around
in
a
daze
until
the
end
he
left
no
word
of
explanation
behind
the
man
hunt
they
were
hunting
him
squads
of
coppers
with
rifles
detectives
stool
pigeons
were
hunting
him
and
the
people
who
had
read
the
story
in
the
newspapers
and
looked
at
his
picture
they
too
were
hunting
him
tommy
looked
out
of
the
smeared
window
of
the
room
in
which
he
sat
and
stared
at
the
snow
a
drift
of
snow
across
the
roofs
a
scribble
of
snow
over
the
pavement
there
were
automobiles
racing
through
the
streets
loaded
with
armed
men
there
were
crowds
looking
for
a
telltale
face
in
their
own
midst
guards
deputies
coppers
were
surrounding
houses
and
peering
into
alleys
raiding
saloons
ringing
doorbells
the
whole
city
was
on
his
heels
the
city
was
like
a
pack
of
dogs
sniffing
wildly
for
his
trail
and
when
they
found
it
they
would
come
whooping
toward
him
for
a
leap
at
his
throat
well
here
he
was
waiting
it
was
snowing
outside
there
was
no
noise
in
the
street
a
man
was
passing
one
of
the
pack
no
just
a
man
the
man
looked
up
tommy
took
his
face
slowly
away
from
the
window
he
had
a
gun
in
his
pocket
and
his
hand
was
holding
it
but
the
man
was
walking
away
huh
if
the
guy
knew
that
lucky
tommy
was
watching
him
from
a
window
he
walk
a
little
faster
if
the
guy
knew
that
lucky
who
had
busted
his
way
out
of
jail
and
was
being
hunted
by
a
million
people
with
guns
was
sitting
up
here
behind
the
window
throw
a
fit
but
he
did
know
he
was
like
the
walls
and
the
windows
and
the
snow
outside
quiet
and
peaceful
nice
boy
grinned
tommy
then
he
began
to
fidget
he
ought
to
go
out
and
buy
a
paper
see
what
was
doing
see
what
became
of
mac
and
the
rest
of
the
boys
maybe
they
all
been
nabbed
but
they
could
do
him
harm
on
account
nobody
knew
where
he
was
no
pal
no
dame
nobody
knew
he
was
sitting
here
in
the
room
looking
at
the
snow
and
just
thinking
the
papers
were
probably
full
of
stories
about
his
racing
across
the
country
and
hiding
in
haystacks
and
behind
barns
kid
stuff
maybe
he
should
ought
to
of
left
town
but
it
felt
better
in
town
some
rube
was
always
sure
to
pick
out
a
stranger
beating
it
down
a
empty
road
and
there
was
no
place
to
hide
long
empty
stretches
where
anybody
could
see
you
for
a
mile
better
in
town
lots
of
walls
alleys
roofs
lots
of
things
like
that
no
effect
like
in
the
country
but
the
papers
were
probably
full
of
a
lot
of
bunk
he
take
a
walk
later
and
buy
a
few
better
sit
still
now
there
was
nothing
harder
to
find
than
a
man
sitting
still
tommy
yawned
not
much
sleep
the
night
before
well
he
sleep
tonight
worrying
was
going
to
help
matters
what
if
they
did
come
let
them
come
fill
up
the
street
and
begin
their
damn
shooting
they
think
lucky
tommy
was
sucker
enough
to
let
them
march
him
up
on
a
scaffold
and
break
his
neck
on
the
end
of
a
rope
fat
chance
not
him
that
sort
of
stuff
happened
to
other
guys
not
to
lucky
tommy
snowing
outside
and
quiet
everybody
at
work
funny
about
that
tommy
was
the
only
free
man
in
the
city
there
was
nobody
felt
like
him
right
now
nobody
where
would
he
be
exactly
this
time
a
week
from
now
if
he
could
only
look
ahead
and
see
himself
at
four
next
monday
afternoon
but
he
was
free
now
no
breaking
his
neck
on
the
end
of
a
rope
if
worst
came
to
worst
if
worst
came
to
worst
fingers
took
a
grip
on
the
gun
in
his
pocket
they
were
hunting
him
up
and
down
the
streets
everywhere
racing
around
in
taxis
with
rifles
sticking
out
of
the
windows
well
why
did
they
come
into
this
street
all
they
had
to
do
was
figure
out
here
the
street
tommy
is
hiding
in
and
that
looks
like
the
house
and
then
somebody
would
yell
out
there
he
is
behind
that
window
that
him
why
did
this
happen
christmas
maybe
he
call
on
the
folks
no
rube
stuff
a
million
coppers
would
be
watching
the
house
but
he
might
drop
them
a
letter
too
bad
he
did
have
any
paper
or
he
might
write
a
lot
of
letters
to
the
chief
of
police
and
all
the
head
hunters
some
more
rube
stuff
that
they
could
tell
by
the
postmark
what
part
of
the
city
he
was
hiding
in
and
they
be
on
him
with
a
whoop
funny
how
he
had
landed
in
this
room
no
plans
no
place
in
particular
to
head
for
that
was
the
best
way
like
he
figured
it
out
and
it
turned
out
perfect
grab
the
first
auto
and
ride
like
hell
and
keep
on
changing
autos
and
riding
around
and
around
in
the
streets
and
crawling
deeper
into
the
city
until
the
trail
was
all
twisted
and
he
was
buried
but
he
ought
to
shave
his
mustache
off
hell
what
for
if
they
came
whooping
into
the
street
they
find
him
mustache
or
no
mustache
but
what
if
he
wanted
to
buy
some
papers
it
was
getting
darker
now
the
snow
was
letting
up
just
dribbling
better
if
it
would
snow
a
lot
then
he
could
sit
and
have
something
to
watch
snow
falling
on
the
street
and
turning
things
white
that
was
on
account
of
his
headache
he
was
thinking
that
way
eats
might
help
but
he
was
hungry
scared
no
just
waiting
hunters
winding
in
and
out
like
the
snow
that
was
falling
people
were
funny
they
got
a
big
thrill
out
of
hunting
a
live
man
who
was
free
in
the
streets
he
be
walking
some
day
strolling
around
the
streets
free
as
any
of
them
maybe
not
in
town
some
other
town
take
a
walk
down
state
street
drop
in
at
a
movie
kid
stuff
walk
over
to
mac
saloon
and
kind
of
casually
say
hello
fellows
and
walk
out
again
god
they
never
hang
him
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
but
they
never
hang
him
dark
now
but
the
guys
hunting
him
were
going
to
sleep
lights
were
going
on
in
the
windows
better
light
up
the
room
people
might
notice
a
dark
window
but
a
lighted
one
would
look
all
right
it
was
not
snowing
any
more
just
cold
well
he
go
out
in
a
while
stretch
his
legs
and
buy
the
papers
and
give
them
a
reading
and
then
take
a
walk
just
walk
around
and
take
in
the
streets
and
see
if
there
was
anybody
he
knew
no
rube
stuff
that
better
stick
where
he
was
lucky
tommy
walked
around
in
the
room
the
drawn
window
blind
held
his
eye
wagons
were
passing
what
for
yes
and
there
was
a
noise
like
people
coming
turn
out
the
light
then
he
take
a
look
tommy
peeled
back
the
blind
carefully
dark
lights
in
windows
some
guys
on
the
corner
hunting
him
sure
and
they
were
coming
his
way
straight
down
the
street
they
were
looking
up
what
for
a
gun
crept
out
of
tommy
pocket
he
pressed
himself
carefully
against
the
wall
he
waited
the
minutes
grew
long
but
this
was
the
hunt
closing
in
they
were
coming
black
figures
of
men
floating
casually
down
the
street
all
right
let
them
come
lucky
tommy
eyes
stared
rigidly
out
of
the
smeared
window
at
a
vague
flurry
of
figures
that
seemed
to
be
coming
coming
his
way
winkelberg
there
was
never
a
man
as
irritating
as
winkelberg
he
was
an
encyclopedia
of
misfortune
everything
which
can
happen
to
a
man
had
happened
to
him
he
had
lost
his
family
his
money
and
his
health
he
was
in
short
a
man
completely
broken
tall
thin
with
a
cadaverous
face
out
of
which
shone
two
huge
lusterless
eyes
he
walked
with
an
angular
crawl
that
reminded
one
of
the
emaciated
flies
one
sees
at
the
beginning
of
winter
dragging
themselves
perversely
along
as
if
struggling
across
an
illimitable
expanse
of
flypaper
it
was
one
of
winkelberg
worst
habits
to
appear
at
unexpected
moments
but
perhaps
any
appearances
poor
winkelberg
might
have
made
would
have
had
this
irritating
quality
of
unexpectedness
one
was
never
looking
forward
to
winkelberg
and
thus
the
sight
of
his
wan
determined
smile
his
lusterless
eyes
and
his
tenacious
crawl
was
invariably
an
uncomfortable
surprise
i
will
be
frank
it
was
winkelberg
misfortune
which
first
attracted
me
i
listened
to
his
story
avidly
he
talked
in
slow
words
and
there
was
intelligence
in
the
man
he
was
able
to
perceive
himself
not
only
as
a
starving
human
but
he
glimpsed
with
his
large
tired
eyes
his
relation
to
things
outside
himself
i
remember
he
said
and
without
emotion
there
is
nobody
to
blame
not
even
myself
and
if
i
can
not
blame
myself
how
can
i
blame
the
world
the
city
is
like
that
i
am
no
good
i
am
done
something
worn
out
and
useless
people
try
to
take
care
of
the
useless
ones
and
they
would
like
to
there
are
institutions
i
was
kicked
out
of
two
of
them
they
said
i
was
a
faker
somehow
i
do
appeal
to
charitably
inclined
people
later
i
understood
why
it
was
because
of
the
man
smile
a
feeble
tenacious
grimace
that
seemed
to
be
offering
a
sardonic
reproof
it
could
never
have
been
mistaken
for
a
courageous
smile
the
secret
of
its
aggravating
quality
was
this
in
it
winkelberg
accused
himself
of
his
uselessness
his
feebleness
his
poverty
it
was
as
if
he
were
regarding
himself
continually
through
the
annoyed
eyes
of
others
and
addressing
himself
with
the
words
of
others
you
winkelberg
get
out
of
here
you
a
nuisance
you
make
me
uncomfortable
because
you
poor
and
diseased
and
full
of
gloom
get
out
i
do
want
you
around
why
the
devil
do
you
die
and
the
aggravating
thing
was
that
people
looked
at
winkelberg
smile
as
into
a
mirror
they
saw
in
it
a
reflection
of
their
own
attitude
toward
the
man
they
felt
that
winkelberg
understood
what
they
thought
of
him
and
they
did
like
that
they
did
like
to
feel
that
winkelberg
was
aware
that
deep
inside
their
minds
they
were
always
asking
why
this
winkelberg
die
and
have
it
over
with
because
that
made
them
out
as
cruel
heartless
people
not
much
different
in
their
attitude
toward
their
fellow
men
from
predatory
animals
in
their
attitude
toward
fellow
predatory
animals
and
somehow
although
they
really
felt
that
way
toward
winkelberg
they
preferred
not
to
believe
it
but
winkelberg
smile
was
a
mirror
which
would
not
let
them
escape
this
truth
and
eventually
winkelberg
smile
became
for
them
one
of
those
curious
mirrors
which
exaggerate
images
grotesquely
charitably
inclined
people
as
well
as
all
other
kinds
of
inclined
people
prefer
their
winkelbergs
more
egoistic
they
prefer
that
unfortunate
ones
be
engrossed
in
their
misfortunes
and
not
go
around
wearing
sardonic
philosophical
smiles
winkelberg
dragged
along
for
a
year
he
was
past
fifty
each
time
i
saw
him
i
was
certain
i
would
never
see
him
again
i
was
certain
he
would
die
drop
dead
while
crawling
across
his
flypaper
but
he
would
appear
i
would
pretend
to
be
vastly
busy
he
would
sit
and
wait
he
never
asked
alms
i
would
have
been
relieved
if
he
had
instead
he
sat
and
smiled
and
his
smile
said
you
are
afraid
i
am
going
to
ask
you
for
money
worry
i
wo
ask
you
for
money
i
wo
bother
you
at
all
yes
i
agree
with
you
i
ought
to
be
dead
it
would
be
better
for
everybody
we
would
talk
little
he
would
throw
out
a
hint
now
and
then
that
perhaps
i
could
use
some
of
his
misfortunes
for
material
for
instance
the
time
his
two
children
had
been
burned
to
death
or
the
time
he
had
fallen
off
the
street
car
while
in
a
sick
daze
and
injured
his
spine
for
life
and
how
he
had
settled
with
the
street
car
company
for
and
how
he
had
been
robbed
on
the
way
to
the
bank
with
the
money
two
weeks
later
i
refused
consistently
this
offer
of
material
this
offended
winkelberg
he
would
shake
his
head
and
then
he
would
nod
his
head
understandingly
and
his
smile
would
say
yes
yes
i
understand
you
do
want
to
get
involved
with
me
because
you
do
want
me
to
have
any
more
claims
on
your
sympathy
than
i
got
i
sorry
toward
the
end
winkelberg
visits
grew
more
frequent
and
he
became
suddenly
garrulous
he
wished
to
discuss
things
the
city
the
various
institutions
politics
art
this
phase
of
winkelberg
was
the
most
unbearable
he
was
willing
to
admit
himself
a
social
outcast
he
was
reconciled
to
the
fact
that
he
would
starve
to
death
and
that
everybody
who
had
ever
seen
him
would
feel
it
had
been
a
good
thing
that
he
had
finally
died
but
this
final
plea
came
from
him
he
wanted
nothing
except
to
talk
and
hear
words
in
order
to
relieve
the
loneliness
of
his
days
he
would
like
abstract
discussions
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
winkelberg
and
the
winkelberg
misfortunes
his
smile
now
said
i
am
useless
worn
out
and
better
off
dead
but
never
mind
me
my
mind
is
still
alive
it
still
thinks
i
wish
it
did
i
wish
it
crawled
around
like
my
body
but
seeing
that
it
does
talk
to
me
as
if
it
were
a
mind
belonging
to
somebody
else
and
not
to
the
insufferable
winkelberg
i
grew
suspicious
finally
i
began
to
think
there
was
something
vitally
spurious
about
this
whole
winkelberg
business
and
i
said
to
myself
the
man
a
downright
fake
if
anybody
were
as
pathetic
and
impossible
and
useless
as
this
winkelberg
is
he
would
shoot
himself
winkelberg
shoot
himself
so
he
becomes
illogical
unreal
a
woman
i
know
belongs
to
the
type
that
becomes
charitable
around
christmas
time
she
makes
a
glowing
pretense
of
aiding
the
poor
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
really
does
aid
them
although
she
regards
the
poor
as
a
sort
of
social
and
spiritual
asset
they
afford
her
the
double
opportunity
of
appearing
in
the
eyes
of
her
neighbors
as
a
magnanimous
soul
and
of
doing
something
which
reflects
great
credit
upon
her
character
but
anyway
she
does
good
and
we
let
it
go
at
that
i
told
this
woman
about
winkelberg
i
became
poignant
and
moving
on
the
subject
of
winkelberg
misfortunes
his
trials
sufferings
and
above
all
his
spartan
stoicism
it
pleased
me
to
do
this
i
felt
that
i
was
making
some
amends
and
that
the
thing
reflected
credit
upon
my
character
so
she
went
to
the
room
on
the
south
side
where
winkelberg
sleeps
and
they
told
her
there
that
winkelberg
was
dead
he
had
died
last
week
she
was
upset
when
she
told
me
about
it
she
had
come
too
late
she
might
have
saved
him
it
was
a
curious
thing
but
when
she
told
me
that
winkelberg
was
dead
i
felt
combatively
that
it
was
untrue
and
now
since
i
know
certainly
that
winkelberg
is
dead
and
buried
i
have
developed
a
curious
state
of
mind
i
look
up
from
my
desk
every
once
in
a
while
expecting
to
see
him
in
the
streets
i
sometimes
find
myself
actually
thinking
i
bump
into
him
when
i
turn
the
corner
i
have
managed
to
discover
the
secret
of
this
feeling
it
is
smile
winkelberg
smile
was
the
interpretation
of
the
world
attitude
toward
him
including
my
own
and
thus
whenever
his
name
comes
to
mind
his
smile
appears
as
if
it
were
the
thought
in
my
head
and
in
smile
i
hear
myself
saying
he
is
better
off
dead
a
man
over
there
said
judge
sabath
is
a
man
who
has
been
a
juror
in
criminal
cases
at
least
a
dozen
times
his
honor
pointed
to
a
short
thin
man
with
a
derby
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
a
startling
mustache
concealing
almost
half
of
his
wizened
face
the
man
was
sitting
a
bit
childishly
on
a
window
ledge
in
the
hall
of
the
criminal
court
building
swinging
his
legs
and
chewing
rhythmically
on
a
plug
of
tobacco
they
let
him
go
this
morning
while
picking
a
jury
for
a
robbery
case
before
me
said
the
judge
he
tried
to
stay
on
but
neither
side
wanted
him
you
might
get
a
story
out
of
him
i
think
he
the
short
thin
man
with
the
derby
swinging
his
legs
from
the
window
ledge
said
his
name
was
martin
that
true
he
said
what
the
judge
said
i
been
a
juror
fourteen
times
i
was
on
five
murders
and
four
big
robberies
and
then
i
was
on
five
different
assorted
kinds
of
crimes
how
do
you
like
being
a
juror
mr
martin
well
sir
i
like
it
a
lot
i
can
say
that
out
of
the
fourteen
times
i
been
a
juror
i
never
lost
a
case
martin
aimed
at
the
new
cuspidor
and
missed
there
some
jurors
as
loses
nearly
every
case
they
on
they
give
in
first
crack
but
take
the
whitely
murder
trial
i
was
on
that
was
as
near
as
i
ever
come
to
losing
a
case
but
i
managed
to
hang
the
jury
and
the
verdict
was
one
of
disagreement
whitely
was
innocent
anybody
could
have
told
that
with
half
an
eye
how
long
have
you
been
serving
on
juries
mr
martin
going
nigh
on
years
i
had
my
first
case
when
i
was
a
young
man
it
was
a
minor
case
a
robbery
i
won
that
despite
my
youth
and
inexperience
in
those
days
the
cases
were
much
harder
than
now
on
account
of
the
lawyers
the
lawyer
was
the
talkingest
kind
of
a
nuisance
i
ever
had
to
deal
with
he
always
reminded
me
of
somebody
talking
at
a
mark
for
two
dollars
a
week
i
do
refer
to
the
orators
i
mean
the
ones
who
talk
during
the
case
itself
and
who
slow
things
up
generally
by
bothering
the
witnesses
to
death
with
a
lot
of
unnecessary
questions
although
the
orators
are
pretty
bad
too
there
many
a
lawyer
who
has
lost
out
with
me
on
account
of
the
way
he
made
faces
in
the
windup
one
of
my
rules
as
a
juror
a
successful
one
i
might
say
is
mistrust
a
lawyer
who
talks
too
fancy
judge
sabath
just
said
that
they
let
you
go
in
his
court
this
morning
h
snorted
martin
that
was
the
lawyer
he
mad
at
me
because
he
lost
a
case
two
years
ago
that
i
was
on
i
won
it
and
he
holds
a
grudge
that
like
some
lawyers
they
do
like
the
man
who
licks
them
but
you
were
asking
about
the
qualifications
of
an
juryman
i
give
to
you
first
and
foremost
you
want
a
man
of
wide
experience
in
human
nature
i
spend
most
of
my
time
in
the
courts
when
i
serving
as
juror
studyin
human
nature
you
might
say
that
all
human
nature
is
the
same
but
it
my
experience
that
some
is
more
so
than
others
well
when
you
know
human
nature
the
next
step
is
to
figure
out
about
lawyers
lawyers
as
a
whole
is
the
hardest
nut
the
juror
has
to
crack
to
begin
with
they
deceivin
and
if
you
let
them
they
take
advantage
of
your
credulity
there
erbstein
for
instance
the
criminal
lawyer
he
a
pretty
smart
one
but
i
won
a
case
from
him
only
four
years
ago
and
he
never
forgiven
me
i
was
juror
in
a
manslaughter
trial
he
was
trying
to
run
he
thought
himself
pretty
foxy
but
when
it
came
to
a
showdown
i
put
it
all
over
him
there
was
a
guy
who
was
foreman
of
the
jury
that
time
who
said
i
had
it
all
over
erbstein
as
an
argufier
and
that
my
arguments
made
his
look
like
ten
cents
i
won
easily
on
five
ballots
and
erbstein
has
never
forgave
me
but
i
go
on
about
the
qualifications
first
of
all
i
never
read
newspapers
never
no
juror
should
ought
to
know
anything
about
anything
that
going
on
i
found
that
out
in
my
youth
when
i
first
started
in
the
first
question
they
ask
you
is
have
you
heard
about
this
case
and
what
have
you
read
or
said
about
it
that
the
first
one
well
the
right
answer
is
if
you
can
say
nothing
and
prove
you
right
they
gobble
you
up
as
a
juror
for
that
reason
i
avoid
all
newspapers
and
right
now
i
do
know
what
big
crimes
or
cases
have
been
committed
at
all
i
have
a
clean
unprejudiced
mind
and
i
keep
it
that
way
nextly
said
martin
trying
a
new
sight
on
the
cuspidor
i
belong
to
any
lodges
whatsoever
they
a
handicap
because
if
the
defendant
is
a
mason
and
you
are
a
elk
he
would
rather
have
a
brother
mason
be
juror
than
a
strange
elk
so
i
do
belong
to
any
of
them
and
i
do
go
to
church
i
also
have
no
convictions
whatsoever
about
politics
and
have
no
favorites
of
any
kind
in
the
matter
of
authors
or
statesmen
or
anything
what
i
try
to
do
is
to
keep
my
mind
clean
and
unprejudiced
on
all
subjects
why
do
you
like
serving
as
a
juror
martin
stared
why
he
repeated
because
it
every
man
duty
naturally
and
besides
he
went
on
narrowing
his
eyes
into
shrewd
slits
i
just
been
luckier
than
most
people
most
people
only
get
called
a
few
times
during
their
life
but
i
get
called
regularly
every
year
and
sometimes
twice
a
year
and
sometimes
four
and
five
times
a
year
for
service
of
course
i
ai
boasting
but
the
city
has
recognized
my
merits
no
doubt
as
a
juror
knowing
all
the
cases
i
won
and
it
perhaps
shows
a
little
partiality
to
me
for
that
reason
but
i
feel
that
i
have
earned
it
and
i
would
like
nothing
said
about
it
or
any
scandal
started
what
do
you
think
of
this
taylor
death
mystery
in
los
angeles
mr
martin
ha
ha
said
martin
there
you
tryin
to
catch
me
you
thought
you
could
put
that
over
on
me
without
my
seein
through
it
did
you
that
just
the
way
the
lawyers
try
to
trap
me
when
i
sittin
on
one
of
my
cases
i
ai
ever
heard
of
this
taylor
death
mystery
not
reading
the
papers
you
see
that
too
bad
martin
it
quite
a
story
martin
sighed
and
slipped
from
the
window
ledge
shaking
down
his
wrinkled
pants
yes
he
sighed
a
sudden
wistfulness
coming
into
his
rheumy
eyes
things
have
been
pretty
slow
around
here
chicago
used
to
be
the
place
for
a
juror
none
better
but
i
been
thinkin
of
going
west
not
that
i
heard
anything
mind
you
about
any
of
these
cases
martin
glowered
virtuously
i
never
read
the
papers
sir
and
have
no
prejudices
whatsoever
but
i
just
been
feelin
lately
that
there
are
wider
opportunities
in
the
west
for
a
man
of
my
experience
and
record
than
are
left
around
here
to
bert
williams

among

the

valhalla
of
the

reading
their
press
notices
to
one
another
and
listening
to
the
hosannas
of
such
critics

pry
into

today

bravo
williams
the
great
hall
rings
with
the
great
hall
begins
to
fill
with
chuckles
there
it
is
the
same
curious
grin
the
lugubrious
apology
of
a
grin
the
weary
pessimistic
child
of
a
grin
the
great
actors
and
silent
sit
back
on
their
thrones
the
door
of
the
valhalla
of
great
actors
swings
slowly
shut
no
flo
ziegfeld
lighting
this
time
but
a
great
shoot
of
sunshine
for
a
garden
and
the
music
different
easier
to
sing
to
somehow
music
of
harps
and
flutes
and
a
deep
voice
rises
yes
i
would
have
liked
to
have
been
there
in
the
valhalla
of
the
great
actors
when
bert
williams
came
shuffling
through
the
towering
doors
and
stood
singing
his
entrance
song
to
the
silent

michigan
avenue
this
is
a
deplorable
street
a
luxurious
couch
of
a
street
in
which
the
afternoon
lolls
like
a
gaudy
sybarite
overhead
the
sky
stretches
itself
like
a
holiday
awning
the
sun
lays
harlequin
stripes
across
the
building
faces
the
smoke
plumes
from
the
engines
scribble
gray
white
and
lavender
fantasies
against
the
shining
air
a
deplorable
street
a
cement
and
plate
glass
circe
we
walk
a
long
procession
of
us
it
is
curious
to
note
how
we
adjust
ourselves
to
backgrounds
in
other
streets
we
are
hurried
flurried
worried
we
summon
portentous
frowns
to
our
faces
our
arms
swinging
at
our
sides
proclaim
make
way
make
way
we
are
launched
upon
activities
vital
to
the
commonwealth
but
here
the
sun
bursts
a
shower
of
little
golden
balloons
from
the
high
windows
the
green
of
a
park
makes
a
cool
salaam
to
the
traffic
of
automobiles
rubber
tires
roll
down
the
wide
avenue
and
make
a
sound
like
the
striking
of
a
match
marble
columns
fountains
incompleted
architectural
elegancies
two
sculptured
lions
and
the
baffling
effulgence
of
a
museum
offer
themselves
like
pensively
anonymous
guests
and
we
walk
like
pierrots
and
pierrettes
like
john
drews
and
jack
barrymores
and
leo
ditrichsteins
like
nazimovas
patricia
collinges
and
messalinas
on
parole
i
have
squandered
an
afternoon
seduced
from
labors
by
this
pied
piper
of
a
street
and
not
only
i
but
everybody
i
ever
knew
or
heard
of
was
in
this
street
strutting
up
and
down
as
if
there
were
no
vital
projects
demanding
their
attention
as
if
life
were
not
a
stern
and
productive
routine
and
where
was
the
rotary
club
not
a
sign
of
the
rotary
club
one
billboard
would
have
saved
me
the
admonitions
that
work
is
man
duty
to
his
nation
that
my
country
needed
me
as
much
in
peace
as
in
war
would
have
scattered
the
insidious
spell
of
this
street
and
sent
me
back
to
the
typewriter
with
at
least
a
story
of
some
waiter
in
a
loop
beanery
who
was
once
a
reigning
prince
of
patagonia
but
there
was
no
sign
no
billboard
to
inspire
me
with
a
sense
of
duty
so
we
strutted
the
long
procession
of
us
a
masquerade
of
leisure
and
complacency
here
was
a
street
in
which
a
shave
and
a
haircut
a
shine
and
a
clean
collar
exhilarated
a
man
with
a
feeling
of
power
and
virtue
as
if
there
were
nothing
else
to
the
day
than
to
decorate
himself
for
the
amusement
of
others
there
were
beggars
in
the
street
but
they
only
add
by
way
of
contrast
to
the
effulgence
of
our
procession
and
besides
are
they
beggars
augustus
caesar
attired
himself
in
beggar
clothes
one
day
each
year
and
asked
alms
in
the
highways
of
rome
i
begin
to
notice
something
an
expression
in
our
faces
as
we
drift
by
the
fastidious
ballyhoos
of
the
shop
windows
we
are
waiting
for
something
actors
walking
up
and
down
in
the
wings
waiting
for
their
cues
to
go
on
this
is
intelligible
this
magician
of
a
street
has
created
the
illusion
in
our
heads
that
there
are
adventure
and
romance
around
us
fauns
pierrots
launcelots
leanders
we
walk
expectantly
waiting
for
our
scenes
to
materialize
here
the
little
steno
in
the
green
tarn
is
laïs
of
corinth
the
dowager
alighting
from
the
electric
is
zenobia
illusions
dress
the
entire
procession
semiramis
leda
and
tailored
nymphs
dryad
eyes
gleam
from
masks
or
if
the
classics
bore
you
watteau
and
the
rococo
pertness
of
the
grand
monarch
and
there
are
gothic
noses
moorish
eyebrows
byzantine
slippers
take
your
pick
walk
up
and
down
and
wait
for
your
cue
there
are
two
lives
that
people
lead
one
is
the
real
life
of
business
mating
plans
bankruptcies
and
gas
bills
the
other
is
an
unreal
life
a
life
of
secret
grandeurs
which
compensate
for
the
monotony
of
the
days
sitting
at
our
desks
hanging
on
to
straps
in
the
street
cars
waiting
for
the
dentist
eating
in
silence
in
our
homes
we
give
ourselves
to
these
secret
grandeurs
in
which
we
figure
as
heroes
and
napoleons
and
don
juans
in
which
we
triumph
sensationally
over
the
stupidities
and
arrogances
of
our
enemies
we
think
them
out
detail
by
detail
sometimes
we
like
to
be
alone
because
we
have
a
particularly
thrilling
incident
to
tell
ourselves
and
when
our
friends
say
we
sigh
with
relief
and
wrap
ourselves
with
a
shiver
of
delight
in
the
mantles
of
imagination
and
we
live
for
a
charming
hour
through
a
fascinating
fiction
in
which
things
are
as
they
should
be
and
we
startle
the
world
with
our
superiorities
this
street
i
begin
to
understand
is
consecrated
to
the
unrealities
so
precious
to
us
we
come
here
and
for
a
little
while
allow
our
dreams
to
peer
timorously
at
life
in
the
streets
west
of
here
we
are
what
we
are
browbeaten
terribly
optimistic
units
of
the
boobilariat
our
secret
characterizations
we
hide
desperately
from
the
frowns
of
windows
and
the
squeal
of
l
trains
but
here
in
this
circe
of
streets
the
sun
warms
us
the
sky
and
the
spaces
of
shining
air
lure
us
and
we
step
furtively
out
of
ourselves
and
give
us
ten
minutes
observe
a
street
of
heroes
and
heroines
actors
all
great
and
irresistible
egoists
do
we
want
riches
then
we
have
only
to
raise
our
finger
slaves
will
attend
with
sesterces
and
dinars
a
street
of
joyous
caligulas
and
neros
with
here
and
there
a
ghengis
khan
an
attila
the
high
buildings
waver
like
gray
and
golden
ferns
in
the
sun
the
sky
stretches
itself
in
a
holiday
awning
over
our
heads
a
breeze
coming
from
the
lake
brings
an
odorous
spice
into
our
noses
adventure
and
romance
yes
and
observe
how
unnecessary
are
plots
here
in
this
circe
of
streets
are
all
the
plots
all
the
great
triumphs
assassinations
amorous
conquests
of
history
unravel
themselves
within
a
distance
of
five
blocks
the
great
moments
of
the
world
live
themselves
over
again
in
a
silent
here
is
one
who
has
just
swum
the
hellespont
one
who
has
subdued
cleopatra
here
one
whose
eyes
are
just
launching
a
thousand
ships
what
a
street
the
afternoon
wanes
our
procession
turns
toward
home
for
a
few
minutes
the
elation
of
our
in
the
avenue
lingers
but
the
l
trains
crowd
up
the
street
cars
crowd
up
it
is
difficult
to
remain
a
caesar
or
a
don
quixote
so
we
withdraw
and
our
faces
become
alike
as
turtle
backs
and
see
the
afternoon
has
been
squandered
there
were
things
which
should
have
been
done
i
blush
indignantly
at
the
memory
of
my
thoughts
during
the
shining
hours
in
the
avenue
for
i
spent
the
valuable
moments
conversing
with
the
devil
i
imagined
him
coming
for
me
and
for
two
hours
i
elaborated
a
dialogue
between
him
and
myself
in
which
i
gave
him
my
immortal
soul
and
he
in
turn
promised
to
write
all
the
stories
novels
and
plays
i
wanted
all
i
would
have
to
do
was
furnish
the
paper
and
leave
it
in
a
certain
place
and
call
for
it
the
next
morning
and
it
would
be
completed
anything
i
asked
for
a
story
novel
or
play
a
poem
a
manifesto
anything
alas
i
am
still
in
possession
of
my
immortal
soul

at

holding

the

everything
gone
but
this
not
even
a

of

or
a
smoking
coat
not
a
blooming
thing
left
but
this
a
suit
beginning
to
shine
a
bit
in
the
rear
the
shades
of
night
were
falling
fast
when
through
an
alpine
village
passed
egad
what
a
primitive
existence
like
an
irunti
in
the
australian
bush
telling
time
by
the
sun
it
must
be
approachin
six
thought
the
captain
as
his
voice
trailed
off
beautiful
thought
mabel
little
mabel
with
her
face
against
the
pane
sits
beside
the
window
looking
at
the
rain
that
was
capt
macveagh
of
the
british
army
prisoner
in
a
la
salle
street
hall
bedroom
no
clothes
to
wear
nothing
but
the
soup
and
fish
so
he
must
sit
and
wait
till
evening
came
till
a
gentleman
could
put
on
his
best
bib
and
tucker
and
then
freshly
shaved
pink
jowled
swinging
his
ebony
stick
his
pumps
gleaming
with
a
new
coat
of
vaseline
off
for
the
british
officers
club
all
day
long
the
herculean
captain
sulked
in
his
tent
an
achilles
with
a
sliver
in
his
heel
but
come
evening
come
the
gentle
shades
of
darkness
and
presto
like
a
lily
of
the
field
who
spun
not
nor
toiled
like
a
knight
of
the
boulevards
this
servant
of
the
king
leaped
forth
in
all
his
glory
the
landlady
was
beginning
to
lose
her
awe
of
the
dress
suit
the
booming
barytone
and
the
large
aristocratic
pink
face
of
her
mysterious
boarder
and
she
was
pressing
for
back
rent
but
the
club
was
still
tolerant
a
soldier
o
the
legion
lay
dyin
in
algiers
chanted
the
captain
and
with
his
shoulders
back
he
strode
into
the
wide
world
a
meal
at
the
club
and
gadzooks
but
his
stomach
was
in
arms
not
a
bite
since
the
last
club
meal
god
bless
the
club
get
a
job
repeated
the
captain
to
one
of
the
members
i
would
but
the
devil
take
it
how
can
a
man
go
around
asking
for
a
job
in
a
dress
suit
and
i
so
rotten
big
that
none
of
my
friends
can
loan
me
a
suit
and
my
credit
is
gone
with
at
least
twelve
different
tailors
i
sort
o
taboo
as
a
borrower
barry
old
top
if
you
will
chase
the
blighter
after
another

i
drink
your
excellent
health
there
a

if
you
want
it
that
you
can

said
his
friend
barry
if
you
do
mind
night
work
not
at
all
growled
capt
macveagh
well
said
the
friend
there
a
circus
in
town
and
they
want
a
man
to
drive
the
chariot
in
the
chariot
race
it
only
a
little
circus
and
there
only
three
chariots
in
the
race
you
get
for
driving
and
a
night
if
you
win
the
race
and
they
give
you
a
bloomin
toga
to
put
on
over
your
suit
you
know
and
a
ribbon
to
tie
around
your
head
and
there
you
are
righto
cried
the
captain
and
where
is
this
rendezvous
of
skill
and
daring
i
off
i
drive
that
chariot
out
of
breath
capt
macveagh
got
the
job
capt
macveagh
won
the
first
race
clad
in
a
flapping
toga
a
ribbon
round
his
forehead
the
hero
of
the
british
army
went
berserker
on
the
home
stretch
and
lashing
his
four
ponies
into
a
panic
came
gloriously
down
the
last
lap
two
lengths
ahead
and
marvelous
coins
of
the
realm
to
the
good
that
night
at
the
club
capt
macveagh
stood
treat
british
wassail
and
what
not
the
dollars
melted
pleasantly
and
the
captain
fell
off
in
a
happy
doze
as
rosy
fingered
aurora
touched
the
city
but
alas
the
wages
of
sin
for
the
captain
was
not
so
good
when
he
mounted
his
chariot
the
second
night
a
beehive
buzzed
in
his
head
and
huge
globular
disturbances
seemed
to
fill
the
air
and
standing
waveringly
on
his
feet
as
the
giddy
chariot
bounced
down
the
track
the
captain
let
forth
a
sudden
yell
and
sailed
off
into
space
the
chariot
ponies
and
hero
of
the
british
army
had
gone
crashing
into
the
side
lines
when
they
brought
him
to
the
hospital
in
the
ambulance
explained
the
captain
friend
they
had
taken
the
toga
off
him
of
course
and
the
old
boy
was
in
his
dress
clothes
this
kind
o
knocked
their
eyes
out
so
what
do
they
do
but
give
him
the
most
expensive
suite
in
the
place
and
the
prettiest
nurse
and
the
star
surgeon
and
they
mend
and
feed
him
up
for
two
weeks
we
all
called
on
him
and
brought
him
a
few
flowers
the
lad
was
surely
in
clover
the
hospital
authorities
had
nothing
to
go
on
but
this
dress
suit
as
evidence
and
when
the
nurse
asked
him
what
he
wanted
done
with
the
suit
saying
it
was
a
bit
torn
from
the
accident
macveagh
waves
his
hand
and
answers
throw
the
blasted
thing
out
of
the
window
or
give
it
to
the
janitor
and
she
did
i
always
thought
it
quite
a
story
but
how
did
it
end
what
became
of
the
captain
when
they
found
out
he
could
pay
his
bill
and
all
that
and
where
he
now
you
have
to
end
the
thing
to
suit
yourself
said
the
friend
all
i
know
is
that
after
almost
forgetting
about
macveagh
i
got
a
letter
from
him
from
london
yesterday
a
rather
mysterious
letter
on
lady
somebody
stationery
it
read
something
like
this
paths
of
glory
lead
but
to
the
grave
thanks
for
the
flowers
and
three
cheers
me
lad
for
the
british
empire
the
sybarite
they
had
been
poor
all
their
lives
the
neighbors
said
it
a
wonder
how
the
sikoras
get
along
they
lived
in
a
rear
flat
four
rooms
that
were
dark
and
three
children
that
were
noisy
the
three
children
used
wabansia
avenue
as
a
playground
dodging
wagons
and
trucks
was
a
diversion
which
played
havoc
with
their
shoes
but
increased
their
skill
in
dodging
wagons
and
trucks
the
neighbors
said
old
man
sikora
is
pretty
sick
it
a
wonder
where
they
get
money
to
pay
the
doctor
then
old
man
sikora
who
was
so
old
but
poverty
and
hard
work
with
a
pick
give
a
man
an
aged
look
was
taken
to
the
county
hospital
the
sikora
children
continued
to
dodge
wagons
and
trucks
and
sikora
went
out
three
days
a
week
to
do
washing
and
the
milkman
and
the
grocer
came
around
regularly
and
explained
to
sikora
that
they
too
had
to
live
and
she
must
pay
her
bills
then
the
neighbors
said
did
you
hear
about
it
old
man
sikora
died
last
night
in
the
hospital
what
will
poor
sikora
do
now
they
ai
got
a
thing
and
old
man
sikora
was
brought
home
because
his
widow
insisted
upon
it
the
neighbors
came
in
and
looked
at
the
body
and
wept
with
sikora
and
the
children
sat
around
after
school
and
looked
uncomfortably
at
the
walls
and
some
one
asked
how
you
going
to
bury
him
mrs
sikora
oh
said
sikora
i
going
to
have
a
good
funeral
there
was
an
insurance
policy
for
the
sikoras
had
kept
it
up
scraping
together
the
premiums
when
the
time
came
sikora
took
the
policy
to
the
husband
of
a
woman
whose
washing
she
had
done
the
husband
was
in
the
real
estate
business
i
need
money
to
bury
my
man
she
said
he
died
last
night
in
the
hospital
she
was
and
dressed
in
black
and
the
real
estate
man
said
what
do
you
want
when
sikora
explained
he
gave
her
for
the
policy
and
she
went
to
an
undertaker
her
eyes
were
still
red
with
crying
they
stared
at
the
luxurious
fittings
of
the
undertaker
parlors
there
were
magnificent
palms
in
magnificent
jardinières
and
plush
chairs
and
large
inviting
sofas
and
an
imposing
mahogany
desk
and
a
cuspidor
of
shining
brass
sikora
felt
thrilled
at
the
sight
of
these
luxuries
then
the
undertaker
came
in
and
she
explained
to
him
the
neighbors
said
are
you
going
to
sikora
funeral
it
going
to
be
a
big
funeral
i
got
invited
yesterday
wabansia
avenue
was
alive
with
automobiles
innumerable
relatives
of
and
sikora
arrived
in
automobiles
their
faces
staring
with
surprise
out
of
the
limousine
windows
as
if
they
were
seeing
the
world
from
a
new
angle
there
were
also
neighbors
these
were
dressed
even
more
impressively
than
the
relatives
but
everybody
neighbors
and
relatives
had
on
their
sunday
clothes
and
the
unlucky
ones
who
had
been
invited
leaned
out
of
the
windows
of
wabansia
avenue
and
looked
enviously
at
the
entourage
there
was
a
band
fifteen
pieces
and
there
was
one
open
automobile
filled
with
flowers
filled
to
overflowing
the
band
stopped
in
front
of
the
sikora
flat
or
rather
in
front
of
the
building
for
the
sikora
flat
was
in
the
rear
and
sikora
did
want
the
band
to
stop
in
the
alley
then
the
envious
ones
leaning
out
of
the
windows
could
see
the
band
and
that
would
be
a
drawback
the
band
played
great
sad
songs
the
cornets
and
trombones
sent
a
muted
shiver
through
the
street
the
band
stopped
playing
and
the
people
leaning
out
of
the
windows
sighed
ah
it
was
a
nice
funeral
inside
the
sikora
house
four
men
stood
up
beside
the
handsome
black
coffin
and
sang
sikora
in
a
voluminous
black
veil
listened
with
tears
running
from
her
face
never
had
she
heard
such
beautiful
singing
before
all
in
time
and
all
the
notes
sweet
and
inspiring
she
wept
some
more
and
solicitous
arms
raised
her
to
her
feet
solicitous
arms
guided
her
out
of
the
room
as
six
men
lifted
the
black
coffin
and
carried
it
into
the
street
slowly
the
automobiles
rolled
away
and
behind
the
open
car
heaped
with
flowers
rode
sikora
the
dolorous
music
of
the
band
filled
her
with
a
gentle
ecstasy
the
flower
scents
drifted
to
her
and
when
her
eyes
glanced
furtively
out
of
the
back
window
of
the
limousine
she
could
see
the
procession
reaching
for
almost
a
half
block
all
black
limousines
filled
with
faces
staring
in
surprise
at
the
street
and
in
front
of
the
flower
car
in
an
ornamental
hearse
rode
sikora
the
wheels
of
the
hearse
were
heavily
tired
they
made
no
sound
and
the
chauffeur
was
careful
that
his
precious
burden
should
not
be
joggled
slowly
through
the
loop
the
procession
picked
its
way
crowds
of
people
paused
to
stare
back
at
the
staring
ones
in
the
automobiles
and
to
listen
to
the
fine
music
that
rose
above
the
clamor
of
the
l
trains
and
the
street
cars
and
the
trucks
the
sun
lay
over
the
cemetery
the
handsome
black
coffin
went
out
of
sight
the
fifteen
musicians
began
to
play
once
more
and
sikora
weeping
anew
allowed
solicitous
arms
to
help
her
back
into
the
limousine
and
with
a
sigh
she
leaned
back
and
closed
her
eyes
and
let
herself
weep
while
the
music
played
while
the
limousine
rolled
smoothly
along
it
was
like
a
dream
a
strange
thing
imagined
or
read
about
somewhere
the
neighbors
sniffed
indignantly
did
you
hear
about
mrs
sikora
they
said
these
were
the
same
ones
who
had
leaned
enviously
out
of
the
wabansia
avenue
windows
she
spent
all
her
insurance
money
on
a
crazy
funeral
the
neighbors
said
and
did
you
hear
about
it
the
juvenile
court
is
going
to
take
her
children
away
because
she
ca
support
them
the
officer
was
out
to
see
her
yesterday
and
she
got
no
money
to
pay
her
bills
she
spent
the
whole
money
it
was
something
like
on
the
funeral
huh
sikora
weeping
explained
to
the
juvenile
court
officer
my
man
died
she
said
and
and
i
spent
the
money
for
the
funeral
it
was
not
for
myself
but
for
him
i
spent
the
money
it
will
turn
out
all
right
some
day
and
in
the
meantime
sikora
when
she
is
washing
clothes
for
someone
will
be
able
when
her
back
aches
too
much
to
remember
the
day
she
rode
in
the
black
limousine
and
the
band
played
and
the
air
was
filled
with
the
smell
of
flowers
dapper
pete
and
the
sucker
play
dapper
pete
handley
the
veteran
con
man
shook
hands
all
around
with
his
old
friends
in
the
detective
bureau
and
followed
his
captors
into
the
basement
another
pinch
for
dapper
pete
another
jam
to
pry
out
of
the
cell
door
closed
and
pete
composed
his
lean
gambler
face
eyed
his
manicured
nails
and
with
a
sigh
sat
down
on
the
wooden
cell
bench
to
wait
for
his
lawyer
whether
i
guilty
of
this
or
not
said
dapper
pete
it
goes
to
show
what
a
sucker
a
guy
is
even
a
smart
guy
this
ai
no
sermon
against
a
life
of
crime
i
pulling
mind
you
i
too
old
to
do
that
and
my
sense
of
humor
is
workin
too
good
i
only
sayin
what
a
sucker
a
guy
is
sometimes
take
me
dapper
pete
registered
mock
woe
not
that
i
guilty
mind
you
or
anything
like
that
but
on
general
principles
i
usually
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
coppers
especially
when
there
been
a
misunderstanding
concerning
some
deal
or
other
well
how
i
happen
to
be
here
just
goes
to
show
what
a
sucker
a
guy
is
even
me
pressed
for
the
key
to
his
dapper
pete
continued
i
come
straight
here
from
grand
island
neb
i
had
a
deal
on
in
grand
island
and
worked
it
for
a
couple
of
months
and
after
i
finished
there
was
trouble
and
i
left
i
knew
there
would
be
warrants
and
commotion
the
deal
having
flopped
and
a
lot
of
prominent
citizens
feeling
as
if
they
had
been
bilked
you
know
how
them
investors
are
if
they
make
per
cent
profit
over
night
they
raise
a
squawk
right
away
and
wan
na
arrest
you
so
i
lit
out
and
came
to
chicago
and
when
i
got
here
some
friends
of
mine
tipped
me
off
that
there
was
considerable
hunt
for
me
well
i
figured
that
the
nebraska
coppers
had
let
out
a
big
holler
and
i
thought
it
best
to
lay
kind
of
low
and
keep
out
of
trouble
that
was
only
last
week
you
see
so
i
get
the
bright
idea
layin
around
town
with
nothin
to
do
but
keep
out
of
sight
ai
the
cinch
it
sounds
you
get
so
sick
and
tired
of
your
own
company
that
you
almost
ready
to
throw
your
arms
around
the
first
harness
bull
you
meet
but
smiled
dapper
pete
i
restrained
myself
there
was
time
out
while
pete
discussed
the
irresponsibility
cruelty
and
selfishness
of
policemen
in
general
after
which
he
continued
with
his
original
narrative
it
was
like
this
he
said
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
take
in
a
few
of
the
points
of
interest
in
the
city
i
ai
ever
got
around
to
being
a
chicagoan
like
most
chicagoans
i
ai
ever
seen
any
of
our
natural
wonders
at
all
so
first
day
out
i
figured
that
the
place
no
copper
would
ever
look
for
me
would
be
like
the
field
museum
and
in
the
zoo
and
on
the
beach
and
like
that
so
first
of
all
i
join
a
rubberneck
crowd
in
one
of
the
carryalls
with
a
megaphone
guy
in
charge
and
i
ride
around
all
day
i
got
kind
of
nervous
owing
to
the
many
coppers
we
kept
passing
and
exchanging
courtesies
with
but
i
stuck
all
day
knowing
that
no
sleuth
was
going
looking
for
dapper
pete
on
a
rubberneck
wagon
well
then
i
spent
three
days
in
the
field
museum
eyeing
the
exhibits
can
you
beat
it
i
walk
around
and
walk
around
rubbering
at
mummies
and
bones
and
well
i
ai
kiddin
but
they
was
among
the
three
most
interesting
days
i
ever
put
in
and
i
felt
pretty
good
too
knowin
that
no
copper
would
be
thinking
of
dapper
pete
as
being
in
the
museums
then
after
that
i
went
to
the
zoo
and
rubbered
at
the
animals
and
birds
and
i
sat
in
the
park
and
watched
comical
ball
games
and
golf
games
and
the
like
and
then
i
went
on
some
of
those
boats
that
run
between
no
place
and
nowhere
you
get
on
at
a
pier
and
ride
for
a
half
hour
and
get
off
at
a
pier
and
have
to
call
a
taxi
in
order
to
find
your
way
back
to
anywhere
you
get
me
i
tellin
you
all
this
said
dapper
pete
cautiously
with
no
reference
to
the
charges
involved
and
for
which
i
am
pinched
and
incarcerated
for
see
but
i
thought
you
might
make
a
story
out
of
the
way
a
guy
like
me
with
all
my
experience
dogin
coppers
can
play
himself
for
a
sucker
well
pretty
soon
i
pretty
near
run
out
of
rube
spots
to
take
in
and
then
i
think
suddenly
of
the
observation
towers
like
on
the
masonic
temple
and
the
wrigley
building
i
headed
for
them
right
away
figuring
to
take
a
sandwich
or
so
along
and
spend
the
day
leisurely
giving
the
city
the
once
over
from
my
eerie
perch
and
when
i
come
home
that
night
and
told
my
friends
about
it
they
was
all
excited
they
all
agreed
that
i
had
made
the
discovery
of
the
age
and
all
claimed
to
feel
sorry
they
was
hiding
out
from
the
coppers
just
for
the
sake
of
bein
able
to
lay
low
on
top
of
a
loop
building
it
does
sound
pretty
good
even
now
i
was
on
my
fifth
day
and
was
just
walking
in
on
the
masonic
temple
observation
platform
when
things
began
to
happen
you
know
how
the
city
looks
from
high
up
like
a
lot
of
toys
crawling
around
and
it
nice
and
cool
and
on
the
whole
as
good
a
place
to
lay
low
in
as
you
want
and
there
always
kind
of
comical
company
see
rubes
on
their
honeymoon
and
sightseers
and
old
maids
and
finicky
old
parties
afraid
of
fallin
off
and
gals
and
their
johns
lookin
for
some
quiet
place
to
spoon
dapper
pete
sighed
in
memory
i
am
sitting
there
nibbling
a
sandwich
he
went
on
when
a
hick
comes
along
and
looks
at
me
pardner
he
says
the
gas
mine
business
and
i
look
at
him
and
pretend
i
do
savvy
at
all
but
this
terrible
looking
rube
grins
and
walks
up
to
me
so
help
me
god
and
pulls
back
his
lapel
and
shows
me
the
big
star
better
come
along
peaceabul
he
says
know
you
pete
handley
just
like
that
so
i
get
up
and
follow
this
hick
down
the
elevator
and
he
turns
me
over
to
a
cop
on
state
street
and
i
am
given
the
ride
to
the
hoosegow
can
you
beat
it
but
who
was
the
party
with
the
star
and
why
the
pinch
i
asked
dapper
pete
that
gentleman
screwed
his
lean
gambler
face
into
a
ludicrous
frown
him
he
sighed
that
was
jim
sloan
constable
from
grand
island
neb
and
they
sent
him
here
about
two
weeks
ago
to
find
me
see
and
all
this
rube
does
is
ride
around
in
rubberneck
wagons
and
take
in
the
museums
and
parks
having
no
idee
where
i
was
he
figured
merely
on
enjoyin
himself
at
nebraska
expense
and
he
was
just
on
the
observation
tower
lookin
over
the
city
in
his
rube
way
when
i
have
to
walk
into
him
yes
sir
pete
handley
and
there
ai
no
slicker
guy
in
the
country
walkin
like
a
prize
sucker
right
into
the
arms
of
a
grand
island
constable
it
all
goes
to
show
sighed
dapper
pete
what
a
small
world
it
is
after
all
waterfront
fancies
man
capacity
for
faith
is
infinite
he
is
able
to
believe
with
passion
in
things
invisible
he
can
achieve
a
fantastic
confidence
in
the
unknowable
here
he
sits
on
the
breakwater
near
the
municipal
pier
a
fishpole
in
his
hand
staring
patiently
into
the
water
he
can
see
nothing
the
lake
is
enormous
it
contains
thousands
of
square
miles
of
water
and
yet
this
man
is
possessed
of
an
unshakable
faith
that
by
some
mysterious
legerdemain
of
chance
a
fish
with
ten
thousand
square
miles
of
water
to
swim
in
safely
will
seek
out
the
little
minnow
less
than
an
inch
in
length
which
he
has
lowered
beside
the
breakwater
and
so
the
victim
of
preposterous
conviction
he
sits
and
eyes
the
tip
of
his
fishpole
with
unflagging
hope
it
is
warm
the
sun
spreads
a
brightly
colored
but
uncomfortable
woolen
blanket
over
their
heads
a
tepid
breeze
reminiscent
of
cinders
whirl
idly
over
the
warm
cement
strung
along
the
pier
are
a
hundred
figures
all
in
identical
postures
they
sit
in
defiance
of
all
logic
all
mathematics
for
it
is
easy
to
calculate
that
if
there
are
a
half
million
fish
in
lake
michigan
and
each
fish
displaces
less
than
five
cubic
inches
of
water
there
would
be
only
two
and
a
half
million
cubic
inches
of
fish
altogether
lost
in
an
expanse
containing
at
least
eight
hundred
billion
cubic
inches
of
water
therefore
the
chance
of
one
fish
being
at
any
one
particular
spot
are
one
in
four
hundred
thousand
in
other
words
the
odds
against
each
of
these
strangely
patient
men
watching
the
ends
of
their
fishpoles
the
odds
against
their
catching
a
fish
are
four
hundred
thousand
to
one
it
is
therefore
somewhat
amazing
to
stand
and
watch
what
happens
along
the
sunny
breakwater
every
three
minutes
one
of
the
poles
jerks
out
of
the
water
with
a
wriggling
prize
on
the
hook
how
are
they
coming
we
ask
oh
so
so
answers
one
of
the
fishermen
and
points
mutely
to
a
string
of
several
dozen
perch
floating
under
his
feet
in
the
water
thus
does
man
by
virtue
of
his
faith
rise
above
the
science
of
mathematics
and
the
barriers
of
logic
thus
is
his
fantastic
belief
in
things
unseen
and
easily
disproved
vindicated
he
catches
fish
where
by
the
law
of
probabilities
there
should
be
no
fish
with
the
whole
lake
stretching
mockingly
before
him
he
sits
consumed
with
a
preposterous
a
fanatical
faith
in
the
little
minnow
dangling
at
the
end
of
his
line
the
hours
pass
the
sun
grows
hotter
the
piles
of
stone
and
steel
along
the
lake
front
seem
to
waver
from
the
distant
streets
come
faint
noises
on
a
hot
day
the
city
is
as
appealing
as
a
cinder
patch
poor
devils
in
factories
poor
devils
in
stores
in
offices
one
must
sigh
thinking
of
them
life
is
even
vaster
than
the
lake
in
which
these
fishermen
fish
and
happiness
is
mathematically
elusive
as
the
fish
for
which
the
fishermen
wait
and
yet
an
old
man
with
a
battered
face
a
young
man
with
a
battered
face
silent
stoical
men
with
fishpoles
a
hundred
two
hundred
they
sit
staring
into
the
water
of
the
lake
as
if
they
were
looking
for
something
for
fish
incredible
one
does
not
sit
like
this
watching
for
something
to
become
visible
why
because
then
there
would
be
an
air
of
suspense
about
the
watcher
he
would
grow
nervous
after
an
hour
when
the
thing
remained
still
invisible
and
finally
he
would
fall
into
hysterics
and
unquestionably
shriek
and
these
men
grow
calmer
then
what
are
they
looking
at
hour
after
hour
under
the
hot
sun
nothing
they
are
letting
the
rhythm
of
water
and
sky
lull
them
into
a
sleep
a
surcease
from
living
this
is
a
very
poetical
thing
for
a
hundred
men
to
attempt
yet
life
may
be
as
intimidating
to
honest
unimaginative
ones
as
to
their
superiors
there
are
many
types
fishing
but
all
of
them
look
soiled
idlers
workers
unhappy
ones
they
come
to
forget
to
let
the
agate
eye
of
the
lake
stare
them
into
a
few
hours
of
oblivion
but
there
is
something
else
long
ago
men
hunted
and
fished
to
keep
alive
they
fought
with
animals
and
sat
with
empty
stomachs
staring
at
the
water
not
in
quest
of
nirvanas
but
of
fish
so
now
after
ages
and
ages
have
passed
there
is
left
a
vague
memory
of
this
in
the
minds
of
these
fishermen
this
memory
makes
them
still
feel
a
certain
thrill
in
the
business
of
pursuit
even
as
they
sit
stoical
and
inanimate
forgetful
of
unpaid
bills
unfinished
and
plans
there
comes
this
curious
thrill
a
mouth
tugs
at
the
little
minnow
the
pole
jerks
electrically
in
the
hand
something
alive
is
on
the
hook
and
the
fisherman
for
an
instant
recovers
his
past
he
is
ab
fighting
with
an
evening
meal
off
the
coast
of
wales
two
glacial
periods
ago
his
body
quivers
his
muscles
set
his
eyes
flash
zip
the
line
leaps
out
of
the
water
another
monster
of
the
deep
whose
conquest
is
necessary
for
the
survival
of
the
race
of
man
has
been
overcome
there
he
hangs
writhing
on
a
hook
there
he
swings
toward
his
triumphant
foe
and
the
hand
of
the
fisherman
on
the
municipal
breakwater
trembling
with
mysterious
elation
closes
about
the
wet
firm
body
of
an
outraged
perch
a
hunt
that
now
bears
the
name
of
sport
yes
but
not
always
here
is
one
with
a
red
battered
face
and
a
curiously
practical
air
about
him
he
is
putting
his
fish
in
a
basket
and
counting
them
two
dozen
perch
want
to
sell
them
he
shakes
his
head
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
he
looks
up
and
grins
slowly
then
he
points
to
his
lips
with
his
fingers
and
makes
signs
this
means
he
is
dumb
he
places
his
hand
over
his
stomach
and
grins
again
he
is
going
to
eat
them
it
is
time
to
go
home
and
do
this
so
he
puts
up
his
fishpole
and
packs
his
primitive
paraphernalia
a
tin
can
a
rusty
spike
a
bamboo
pole
here
is
one
then
who
in
the
heart
of
the
steel
forest
called
civilization
still
seeks
out
long
forgotten
ways
of
keeping
life
in
his
body
he
hunts
for
fish
the
sun
slides
down
the
sky
the
fishermen
begin
to
pack
up
they
walk
with
their
heads
down
and
bent
forward
like
number
they
raise
their
eyes
occasionally
to
the
piles
of
stone
and
steel
that
mark
the
city
front
back
to
their
troubles
and
their
cinder
patch
but
and
this
is
a
curious
fact
their
eyes
gleam
with
hope
and
curiosity
the
snob
we
happen
to
be
on
the
same
street
car
a
drizzle
softens
the
windows
she
sits
with
her
pasty
face
and
her
dull
little
eyes
looking
out
at
the
dripping
street
her
cotton
suit
curls
at
the
lapels
the
ends
of
her
shoes
curl
like
a
pair
of
burlesque
oriental
slippers
she
holds
her
hands
in
her
lap
red
thick
fingers
that
whisper
tiredly
we
have
worked
lie
in
her
lap
a
slavey
on
her
day
off
there
is
no
mistaking
this
nineteen
or
twenty
years
old
homely
as
a
mud
fence
ungraceful
doltish
she
sits
staring
out
of
the
window
and
her
eyes
blink
at
the
rain
a
peasant
from
southeastern
europe
a
field
hand
who
fell
into
the
steerage
of
a
transatlantic
liner
and
fell
out
again
now
she
has
a
day
off
and
she
goes
riding
into
the
country
on
a
street
car
she
will
get
off
and
slosh
with
her
heavy
feet
through
wet
grass
she
will
walk
down
the
muddied
roads
and
drink
in
the
odor
of
fields
and
trees
once
more
these
are
romantic
conjectures
the
car
jolts
along
it
is
going
west
the
rain
continues
it
runs
diagonal
dots
across
the
window
everybody
out
this
is
the
end
of
the
line
i
have
gone
farther
than
necessary
but
there
is
the
slavey
we
have
been
talking
at
least
i
talked
she
listened
her
doltish
face
opening
its
mouth
her
little
eyes
blinking
she
has
pimples
her
skin
is
muddied
a
creature
yet
there
is
something
this
is
her
day
off
a
day
free
from
the
sweat
of
labor
and
she
goes
on
a
street
car
into
the
country
so
it
would
seem
that
under
this
blinking
frowzy
exterior
desire
spreads
its
wings
she
has
memories
this
blousy
one
she
has
dreams
the
drizzle
flies
softly
through
the
air
the
city
has
disappeared
we
walk
down
an
incongruous
stretch
of
pavement
it
leads
toward
a
forest
or
what
looks
like
a
forest
there
are
no
houses
the
sky
asserts
itself
i
look
up
but
the
shambling
one
whose
clothes
become
active
under
water
keeps
her
eyes
to
the
pavement
this
is
disillusioning
here
slavey
is
the
sky
i
think
it
becomes
romantic
for
the
moment
because
to
you
it
is
the
symbol
of
lost
dreams
or
happy
hours
in
fields
to
me
it
is
nothing
but
a
sky
i
have
no
interest
in
skies
but
i
am
looking
at
it
for
you
and
enjoying
it
through
your
romantic
eyes
but
her
romantic
eyes
are
oblivious
they
consult
the
pavement
before
her
and
nothing
else
very
well
there
are
other
and
nicer
skies
in
her
heart
that
she
contemplates
this
is
an
inferior
sky
overhead
we
walk
on
you
see
i
have
been
wrong
it
is
not
green
fields
that
lured
the
heavy
feet
of
this
slavey
she
is
not
a
peasant
cinderella
grief
yes
hidden
sorrow
has
led
her
here
this
is
a
cemetery
it
rains
over
the
cemetery
there
is
silence
the
white
stones
glisten
they
stand
like
beggars
asking
alms
of
the
winding
paths
and
this
blousy
one
has
come
to
be
close
to
one
of
the
white
stones
under
one
of
them
lies
somebody
whose
image
still
lives
in
her
heart
she
will
kneel
in
the
wet
grass
and
her
pasty
little
face
will
blink
its
dull
eyes
over
a
grave
like
a
little
clown
in
her
curling
cotton
suit
her
lumpy
shoes
her
idiotic
hat
she
will
offer
her
tears
to
the
pitiless
silence
of
trees
wind
rain
and
white
stones
do
you
like
them
there
she
asks
she
points
to
a
cluster
of
fancy
headstones
do
you
i
ask
she
smiles
oh
yes
she
says
and
she
stops
she
is
admiring
the
tombstones
we
walk
on
it
is
incredible
this
blousy
one
this
one
has
come
to
the
cemetery
on
her
day
off
to
admire
the
tombstones
ah
here
is
drama
of
a
poignant
kind
let
us
pray
god
there
is
nothing
pathologic
here
and
that
this
is
an
idyl
of
despair
that
the
lumpish
little
slavey
sits
on
the
bench
dreaming
of
fine
tombstones
as
a
flapper
might
dream
of
fine
dresses
yes
at
last
we
are
on
the
track
we
talk
these
are
very
pretty
she
says
life
is
dull
the
days
are
drab
the
place
where
she
works
is
like
an
oven
there
is
nothing
pretty
to
look
at
even
in
mirrors
there
is
nothing
cool
and
pretty
clothes
grow
lumpy
when
she
puts
them
on
boys
giggle
and
call
names
when
she
goes
out
and
so
outcast
she
comes
here
to
the
cemetery
to
dream
of
a
day
when
something
cool
and
pretty
will
belong
to
her
a
headstone
perhaps
a
stately
one
with
a
figure
above
it
it
will
stand
over
her
she
will
be
dead
then
and
unable
to
enjoy
it
but
now
she
is
alive
now
she
can
think
of
how
pretty
the
stone
will
look
and
thus
enjoy
it
in
advance
this
after
all
is
the
technique
of
all
dreams
we
grow
confidential
i
have
asked
what
sort
she
likes
best
what
sort
it
pleases
her
most
to
think
about
as
standing
over
her
grave
when
she
dies
and
she
has
pointed
some
out
it
rains
the
trees
shake
water
and
the
wind
hurries
past
the
white
stones
i
will
tell
you
something
she
says
here
look
at
this
from
one
of
her
curled
pockets
she
removes
a
piece
of
paper
it
is
crumpled
i
open
it
and
read
in
case
of
accident
please
notify
misses
burbley
sheridan
road
and
have
body
removed
to
home
of
parents
who
are
residants
of
corliss
wisconsin
where
they
have
resided
for
twenty
years
and
the
diseased
is
a
only
daughter
named
clara
age
nineteen
and
educated
in
corliss
public
schools
where
she
graduated
as
a
girl
but
came
to
chicago
in
serch
of
employment
and
in
case
of
accident
funeral
was
held
from
home
of
the
parents
many
frends
attending
and
please
omit
flours
i
got
lot
of
them
writ
out
said
clara
blinking
you
wan
na
read
more

oh
because

to
know
who
you

or
what
to
do
with
the
diseased
if
they
do
find
something
her
thick
red
hands
grew
excited
she
produced
further
obituaries
from
her
pocketbook
from
her
bosom
from
her
pockets
and
one
from
under
her
hat
i
read
them
they
were
all
alike
couched
in
vaguely
bombastic
terms
we
sat
in
the
rain
and
i
thought
alas
clara
is
a
bounder
a
snob
she
writes
her
own
obituaries
alive
she
can
think
of
herself
only
as
clara
the
slavey
at
whom
the
boys
giggle
and
call
names
but
dead
she
is
the
the
stately
corpse
commanding
unprecedented
attention
the
prospect
stirs
a
certain
snobbishness
in
her
and
she
sits
and
writes
her
death
notices
out
using
language
she
tries
to
remember
from
reading
the
funeral
accounts
of
rich
and
powerful
people
clara
her
hat
awry
her
doltish
body
sagging
in
the
rain
shuffled
down
the
dirt
road
once
more
her
outing
is
over
cinderella
returns
to
the
ashes
of
life
the
way
home
he
shuffles
around
in
front
of
the
clinton
street
employment
agency
the
signs
say
pick
men
wanted
section
hands
wanted
farm
laborers
wanted
a
mexican
stands
woodenly
against
the
window
front
his
eyes
are
open
but
asleep
he
has
the
air
of
one
come
from
a
far
country
who
lives
upon
memories
there
are
others
roughly
dressed
exiles
their
eyes
occasionally
study
the
signs
deciphering
with
difficulty
the
crudely
chalked
words
on
the
bulletin
boards
slav
swede
pole
italian
greek
they
read
in
a
language
foreign
to
them
that
men
are
wanted
on
the
farms
in
the
dakotas
in
the
lumber
camps
on
the
roadbeds
in
montana
men
with
dull
seamed
faces
and
glittering
eyes
the
proletaire
from
a
dozen
lands
looking
for
jobs
but
this
one
who
shuffles
about
in
a
tattered
mackinaw
huge
baggy
trousers
frayed
at
the
feet
this
one
whose
giant
body
swings
loosely
back
and
forth
under
the
signs
is
a
more
curious
exile
his
mexican
brother
leaning
woodenly
against
the
window
has
a
slow
dream
in
his
eyes
life
is
simple
to
his
thought
it
was
hard
for
him
in
mexico
and
adventure
and
avarice
sent
him
northward
in
quest
of
easier
ways
and
more
numerous
comforts
now
he
hunts
a
job
on
a
chilly
spring
morning
when
the
proper
job
is
chalked
up
on
the
bulletin
board
he
will
go
in
and
ask
for
it
he
stands
and
waits
and
thinks
how
happy
he
was
in
the
country
he
abandoned
and
what
a
fool
he
was
to
leave
the
white
dust
of
its
roads
its
hills
and
blazing
suns
and
some
day
he
thinks
he
will
go
back
although
there
is
nothing
to
go
back
for
yet
it
is
pleasant
to
stand
and
dream
of
a
place
one
has
known
and
whither
one
may
return
but
this
one
who
shuffles
this
giant
in
a
tattered
mackinaw
who
slouches
along
under
the
bulletin
signs
asking
for
section
hands
and
laborers
there
is
no
dream
of
remembered
places
in
his
eyes
dull
blue
eyes
that
peer
bewilderedly
out
of
a
powerful
and
empty
face
the
forehead
is
puckered
as
if
in
thought
the
heavy
jaws
protrude
with
a
hint
of
ferocity
in
their
set
there
is
a
reddish
cast
to
his
hair
and
face
and
the
backs
of
his
great
hands
hanging
limply
almost
to
his
knees
are
covered
with
red
hair
the
nose
of
this
shuffling
one
is
larger
than
the
noses
in
the
city
streets
his
fingers
are
larger
his
neck
is
larger
there
is
a
curious
earthy
look
to
this
shuffling
one
seldom
to
be
seen
about
men
in
streets
he
is
a
huge
creature
with
great
thighs
and
laocoön
sinews
and
he
towers
a
head
above
his
brothers
in
front
of
the
employment
office
he
is
of
a
different
mold
from
the
men
in
the
street
strength
ripples
under
his
tattered
mackinaw
and
his
stiff
looking
hands
could
break
the
heads
of
two
men
against
each
other
like
eggshells
while
they
rained
puny
blows
on
his
dull
face
and
yet
of
all
the
men
moving
about
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
clinton
street
bulletin
boards
it
is
this
shuffling
one
who
is
the
most
impotent
seeming
his
figure
is
the
most
helpless
it
slouches
as
under
a
final
defeat
his
eyes
are
the
dullest
he
stops
at
the
corner
and
stands
waiting
his
head
lowered
his
shoulders
hunched
in
and
he
looks
like
a
man
weighed
down
by
a
harness
a
curious
exile
from
whose
blood
has
vanished
all
memory
of
the
country
to
which
he
belongs
a
faraway
land
ages
beyond
the
roads
of
which
his
mexican
brother
dreams
as
he
stands
under
the
bulletin
boards
a
land
which
the
ingenuity
of
the
world
has
left
forever
behind
this
is
a
land
that
once
reached
over
all
the
seas
for
it
was
like
this
that
men
once
looked
in
an
age
before
the
myths
of
the
persians
and
hindus
began
to
fertilize
the
animal
soul
of
the
race
in
the
forests
north
of
the
earliest
cities
of
greece
along
the
wild
coasts
tapering
from
the
tatar
lands
to
the
peninsula
of
the
basques
men
like
this
shuffling
one
once
ranged
alone
and
in
tribes
huge
powerful
men
whose
foreheads
sloped
back
and
whose
jaws
sloped
forward
and
whose
stiff
hands
reached
an
inch
nearer
their
knees
than
today
this
giant
in
the
tattered
mackinaw
is
an
exile
from
this
land
and
there
is
no
dream
of
it
left
in
his
blood
the
body
of
his
fathers
has
returned
to
him
their
long
loose
arms
their
thick
muscles
and
heavy
pounding
veins
are
his
but
their
voices
are
buried
too
deep
to
rise
again
in
him
the
mutterings
of
warrior
councils
the
shouts
of
terrible
hunts
are
lost
somewhere
in
him
and
he
shuffles
along
his
sloping
forehead
in
a
pucker
of
thought
as
if
he
were
trying
to
remember
but
no
memories
come
instead
a
bewilderment
the
swarming
streets
bewilder
him
the
towering
buildings
the
noises
of
traffic
and
people
dull
his
eyes
and
bring
his
shoulders
together
like
the
shoulders
of
some
helpless
captive
he
returns
to
the
employment
office
and
raises
his
eyes
to
the
bulletin
boards
he
reads
slowly
his
large
lips
moving
as
they
form
words
in
another
day
or
another
week
he
will
be
riding
somewhere
his
dull
eyes
gazing
out
of
the
train
window
they
will
call
him
ole
or
pat
or
jim
in
some
camp
in
the
dakotas
or
along
some
roadbed
in
montana
he
will
stand
with
a
puny
pick
handle
in
his
huge
hands
and
his
arms
will
rise
and
fall
mechanically
as
he
hews
away
along
a
deserted
track
and
his
forehead
will
still
be
puckered
in
a
frown
of
bewilderment
the
thing
held
in
his
fists
will
seem
like
a
strange
toy
farm
laborers
in
kansas
says
the
bulletin
board
as
the
clerk
with
his
piece
of
chalk
the
office
the
mexican
slowly
removes
himself
from
the
window
and
the
contemplation
of
memories
kansas
lies
to
the
south
and
to
the
south
is
the
way
home
he
goes
in
and
talks
to
the
man
behind
the
long
desk
an
hour
later
the
clerk
and
his
piece
of
chalk
emerge
the
exiles
are
still
mooching
around
on
the
pavement
and
the
shuffling
one
stands
on
the
curb
staring
dully
at
the
street
under
him
section
hands
alberta
canada
transportation
says
the
new
bulletin
there
is
no
stir
among
the
exiles
this
is
to
the
north
it
is
still
cold
in
the
north
but
the
shuffling
one
has
turned
his
eyes
again
trace
the
crudely
chalked
letters
of
the
bulletin
board
his
lips
move
as
he
tells
himself
what
is
written
and
then
as
if
unconsciously
he
moves
toward
the
door
alberta
is
to
the
north
and
the
voices
that
lie
buried
deep
under
the
giant
mackinaw
whisper
darkly
that
to
the
north
to
the
north
is
the
way
home
the
pig

the

of

awaiting
their
turn
before

the

anton
steps
out
the
matter
with
anton
an
indignant
face
its
chin
raised
its
eyes
marching
defiantly
to
the
bar
of
justice
sofie
too
but
weeping
and
a
lawyer
sofie
lawyer
well
what
up
why
should
the
popapovitches
take
up
valuable
time
think
of
the
taxpayers
supporting
this
court
and
two
popapovitches
marching
up
to
have
an
argument
on
the
taxpayers
money
well
that
civilization
ah

it
appears
that
anton
the
rogue
went
to
a
grand
ball
and
raffle
given

wrong
with
that
why
must
sofie

a
very
fine
citizen

he
belongs
to
a
lodge
that
gives
grand
balls
and
he
takes
his
wife

on
says
the
judge
what
happened
what
the
complaint
time
is
precious
let
have
it
in
a
nutshell
this
is
a
good
idea
people
spend
a
frightful
lot
of
unnecessary
time
weeping
and
mumbling
in
the
courts
popapovitch
will
please
stop
weeping
and
get
down
to
brass
tacks
very
well
the
complaint
is
your
honor
that
popapovitch
got
drunk
at
the
grand
ball
but
that
the
end
of
it
there
some
more
a
paragraph
of
tears
and
then
your
honor
listen
to
this
popapovitch
not
only
got
drunk
but
he
took
a
chance
on
the
raffle
which
cost

dollar
and
he
won
but
what
did
he
win

he
won
a
pig
a
live
pig
that
was
the
prize
a
small
live
pig
with
a
ribbon
round
its
neck
and
says
popapovitch
there
humor
in
a
long
name
because
it
conjures
up
visions
of
bewildered
people
and
bewildered
people
are
always
humorous
and
says
she
they
had
been
married
ten
years
happily

whole
bathtub
full
of
mud
and
when
the
pig
sees
this
he
gets
happy
and
lies
down
and
goes
to
sleep
and
anton
sits
in
the
bathroom
and
looks
at
the
pig
all

says

terrible
thing

it
to

a
pig
that

squealing
in
the
bathtub
and
splashing
mud
all
day
but

do
this
thing

ashamed
and
willing
to
apologize
and
kiss
and
make
up
anton
step
forward
and
tell
his
honor
but
be
careful
popapovitch
has
a
lawyer
and
it
will
go
bad
with
you
if
you
do
talk
carefully
all
right
here
anton
he
nods
and
keeps
on
nodding
what
is
this
what
he
nodding
about
did
this
happen
as
your
wife
says
anton
anton
blows
out
his
cheeks
and
rubs
his
workingman
hand
over
his
mouth
to
think
that
you
should
beat
your
wife
who
has
always
been
good
to
you
anton
who
has
cooked
and
been
true
to
you
and
there
are
no
children
to
worry
you
not
one
and
you
beat
her
bah
is
that
a
man
do
you
love
your
wife
yes
all
right
then
why
did
you
do
it

looks
up
surprised
because
says
anton
still
surprised
like
she
say
she
kill
my
pig
you
hear
yourself
your
honor
she
say
she
kill
him
and
i
put
him
in
the
bathtub
and
give
him
mud
and
she
kill
him
but
is
that
a
reason
to
beat
your
wife
and
nearly
kill
her
it
is
says
anton
well
then
why
tell
the
judge
why
you
were
so
fond
of
this
pig
anton
ah
yes
anton
popapovitch
tell
the
judge
why
you
loved
this
little
pig
so
much
and
made
a
home
for
him
with
mud
in
the
bathtub
why
you
dreamed
of
him
as
you
stood
working
in
the
factory
why
you
ran
home
to
him
and
fed
him
and
sat
and
looked
at
him
and
whispered
nice
little
pig
why
god
knows
but
anton
popapovitch
ca
explain
it
it
must
remain
one
of
the
mysteries
of
our
city
your
honor
call
the
next
case
put
anton
popapovitch
on
parole
perhaps
it
was
because
well
the
matter
is
ended
anton
popapovitch
sighs
and
looks
with
accusing
eyes
at
his
wife
sofie
with
accusing
eyes
that
hint
at
evidence
unheard
the
little
fop
this
little
caricature
of
a
fop
loitering
in
the
hotel
lobby
enthralled
by
his
own
fastidiousness
gazing
furtively
at
the
glisten
of
his
newly
manicured
nails
and
shuddering
with
awe
at
the
memory
of
the
puckered
white
silk
lining
inside
his
prince
of
wales
derby
i
watched
him
for
more
than
a
month
now
here
he
comes
his
pointed
button
shoes
his
trousers
his
natty
tan
overcoat
with
its
high
waist
band
and
its
amazing
lapels
that
stick
up
over
his
shoulders
like
the
ears
of
a
jackass
here
he
comes
embroidered
and
scented
and
looking
like
a
cross
between
a
dancer
and
a
somnambulist
and
here
he
takes
his
position
holding
his
gloves
in
his
hand
his
prince
of
wales
derby
jammed
down
on
his
hair
observe
him
this
is
a
pose
he
is
living
up
to
a
fashion
illustration
in
one
of
the
magazines
or
perhaps
he
is
duplicating
an
attitude
of
some
one
studied
in
a
michigan
avenue
club
entrance
his
right
arm
is
crooked
as
if
he
were
about
to
place
his
hand
over
his
heart
and
bow
his
left
arm
hangs
with
a
slight
curve
at
his
side
his
feet
should
be
together
but
they
shift
nervously
his
head
is
turned
to
the
left
and
slightly
raised
like
a
movie
actor
posing
for
a
cigarette
advertisement
and
there
he
stands
a
dead
ringer
for
one
of
the
waxen
dummies
to
be
seen
in
a
halsted
street
men
snappy
furnishings
store
i
watched
him
for
a
month
off
and
on
and
his
face
still
says
nothing
his
eyes
are
curiously
emotionless
they
appear
suddenly
in
his
face
he
is
undersized
his
nose
despite
the
recent
massage
and
powder
has
a
slight
oleaginous
gleam
to
it
the
cheek
bones
are
a
bit
high
the
mouth
a
trifle
wide
and
the
chin
slightly
bulbous
as
he
blinks
about
him
with
his
small
almost
mongolian
eyes
he
looks
like
some
honest
little
immigrant
from
bohemia
or
poland
whom
a
malignant
sorcerer
has
changed
into
a
caricature
fashion
plate
this
is
indeed
the
legend
of
cinderella
and
the
fairy
godmother
with
an
ending
of
pathos
yet
though
his
face
says
nothing
there
is
a
provoking
air
to
this
little
fop
his
studied
inanimation
his
crudely
pose
his
dull
little
peasant
eyes
staring
at
the
faces
that
drift
by
in
the
lobby
these
ask
for
translation
why
is
he
here
what
does
he
want
why
does
he
come
every
evening
and
stand
and
watch
the
little
hotel
parade
ah
one
never
sees
him
in
the
dining
room
or
on
the
dance
floor
one
never
meets
him
between
the
acts
in
the
theater
lobby
and
one
never
sees
him
talking
to
anybody
he
is
always
alone
people
pass
him
with
a
curious
glance
and
think
to
themselves
ah
a
young
man
about
town
what
a
shame
to
dissipate
like
that
they
sometimes
notice
the
masterly
way
in
which
he
sizes
up
a
chicken
stalking
through
the
lobby
and
think
to
themselves
the
scoundrel
he
the
kind
of
creature
that
makes
a
big
city
dangerous
a
carefully
combed
and
scented
vulture
waiting
to
swoop
down
from
the
side
lines
evening
after
evening
between
and
midnight
he
drifts
in
and
out
of
the
lobby
up
and
down
randolph
street
and
takes
up
his
position
at
various
points
of
vantage
where
crowds
pass
where
women
pass
watched
him
no
one
ever
talks
to
him
there
are
no
salutations
he
is
unknown
and
worse
for
the
women
the
rouged
and
ornamental
ones
know
him
a
bit
too
well
they
know
the
carefully
counted
nickels
in
his
trousers
pocket
the
transfers
he
is
saving
for
the
rebate
that
may
come
some
day
the
various
newspaper
coupons
through
which
he
hopes
to
make
a
killing
all
this
they
know
and
through
a
sixth
sense
a
curious
instinct
of
sex
divination
they
know
the
necktie
counter
or
information
desk
behind
which
he
works
during
the
day
the
stuffy
bedroom
to
which
he
will
go
home
to
sleep
the
vacuity
of
his
mind
and
gaudy
emptiness
of
his
spirit
they
know
all
this
and
pass
him
up
with
never
a
smile
yes
even
the
manicure
girls
in
the
barber
shop
give
him
the
sneer
and
the
girls
and
even
the
floor
girls
the
chambermaids
all
of
whom
he
has
tried
to
date
up
they
all
respond
with
an
identical
raspberry
to
his
invitations
but
he
asks
for
translation
this
determined
little
caricature
of
the
hotel
lobby
a
little
peasant
masquerading
as
a
dazzled
moth
around
the
bright
lights
not
entirely
there
is
something
else
there
is
something
of
a
great
dream
behind
the
ridiculous
pathos
of
this
little
fool
there
is
something
in
him
that
desires
expression
that
will
never
achieve
expression
and
that
will
always
leave
him
just
such
an
absurd
little
clown
of
a
fop
when
the
manicure
girls
read
this
they
will
snort
because
they
know
him
too
well
of
all
the
dumbbells
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
they
will
say
he
wins
the
cement
earmuffs
nobody
home
honest
to
gawd
nothin
but
a
nasty
little
fourflusher
we
know
him
and
his
kind
fortunately
i
do
know
him
as
well
as
the
manicure
girls
do
so
there
is
room
for
this
speculation
as
i
watch
him
in
the
evening
now
and
then
i
see
him
standing
under
the
blaze
of
lobby
lights
in
the
thick
of
passing
fur
coats
and
dinner
jackets
in
the
midst
of
laughter
escorts
intrigues
actors
famous
names
he
stands
perfectly
still
with
his
right
arm
crooked
as
if
he
were
going
to
place
his
hand
over
his
heart
and
bow
with
his
left
arm
slightly
curved
at
his
side
grace
this
is
a
pose
denoting
grace
he
got
it
somewhere
from
an
illustration
and
he
holds
it
here
is
life
the
real
stuff
the
real
thing
lights
and
laughter
glories
coiffures
swell
dames
great
actors
guys
loaded
with
coin
his
little
mongolian
eyes
blink
through
his
amusing
aplomb
here
are
gilded
pillars
and
marbled
walls
great
rugs
and
marvelous
furniture
here
music
is
playing
somewhere
and
people
are
eating
off
dishes
and
now
you
will
smile
at
me
not
him
because
watching
him
of
evenings
on
and
off
a
curious
notion
takes
hold
of
my
thoughts
i
have
noticed
the
race
oddities
of
his
face
the
mongolian
eyes
the
slavic
cheek
bones
the
italian
hair
a
mixed
breed
this
little
fop
mixed
through
a
dozen
centuries
fathers
and
mothers
that
came
from
a
hundred
parts
of
the
earth
but
down
the
centuries
they
had
one
thing
in
common
servitude
the
carlovingian
courts
the
courts
of
the
de
medici
the
valois
and
long
before
that
the
great
houses
that
lay
around
the
roman
hills
dragged
from
their
villages
east
west
north
and
south
they
flitted
in
the
trappings
of
servitude
through
the
vast
halls
of
tyrants
barons
caesars
sybarites
debauchees
they
were
the
torchbearers
the
caitiffs
the
varlets
the
bathkeepers
the
inanimate
figures
whose
faces
watched
from
the
shadows
the
great
orgies
of
tiberius
the
bacchanals
of
satraps
kings
captains
and
squires
and
here
their
little
stands
as
they
stood
the
ghost
of
their
servitude
in
his
sluggish
blood
he
is
content
with
his
role
of
watcher
as
his
people
were
content
these
slightly
grotesque
trappings
of
his
are
a
disguise
he
wishes
to
disguise
the
fact
that
he
is
of
the
torchbearers
the
varlets
the
bathkeepers
who
produced
him
so
he
imitates
servilely
what
he
fancies
to
be
the
distinguishing
marks
of
his
betters
their
clothes
their
manners
their
aplomb
this
accomplished
he
is
content
to
yield
himself
to
the
mysterious
impulses
and
dreams
that
move
silently
through
him
and
so
he
takes
his
position
beside
his
people
the
mixed
breeds
dragged
from
their
scattered
villages
so
he
stands
as
they
stood
through
the
centuries
their
faces
watching
from
the
shadows
the
gorgeousness
and
tumult
of
the
great
aristocrats
mottka
since
most
of
the
great
minds
that
have
weighed
the
subject
have
arrived
at
the
opinion
that
between
poverty
and
crime
there
is
an
inevitable
affinity
the
suspicion
with
which
the
eye
of
policeman
billings
rested
upon
mottka
the
vender
of
roasted
chestnuts
reflected
creditably
upon
that
good
officer
grasp
of
the
higher
philosophies
policeman
billings
sworn
to
uphold
the
law
and
assist
in
the
protection
of
property
viewed
the
complications
and
mysteries
of
the
social
system
with
a
simple
and
penetrating
logic
the
rich
are
not
dangerous
reasoned
policeman
billings
because
they
have
what
they
want
but
the
poor
who
have
not
what
they
want
are
despite
paradox
and
precedent
always
to
be
watched
closely
a
raggedly
dressed
man
walking
in
a
dark
lonely
street
may
be
honesty
itself
yet
rags
even
when
worn
for
virtue
sake
are
a
dubious
assurance
of
virtue
they
are
always
ominous
to
one
sworn
to
protect
property
and
uphold
the
law
there
is
a
maxim
by
chateaubriand
or
perhaps
it
was
stendhal
maxims
have
a
way
of
leaving
home
which
claims
that
the
equilibrium
of
society
rests
upon
the
acquiescence
of
its
oppressed
and
unfortunate
in
passing
the
battered
chestnut
roaster
of
the
unfortunate
mottka
policeman
billings
was
aware
in
his
own
way
of
the
foregoing
elements
of
social
philosophy
mottka
had
chosen
for
his
little
shop
an
old
soapbox
which
a
wastrel
providence
had
deposited
in
the
alley
on
street
a
few
feet
west
of
state
street
here
mottka
sat
nursing
the
fire
of
his
chestnut
roaster
with
odd
bits
of
refuse
which
seldom
reached
the
dignity
of
coal
or
even
wood
he
was
an
old
man
and
the
world
had
used
him
poorly
he
was
in
fact
one
of
those
upon
whom
the
equilibrium
of
the
social
system
rests
he
was
unfortunate
oppressed
and
acquiescent
arriving
early
in
the
forenoon
he
set
up
his
shop
lighted
his
fire
and
took
his
place
on
the
soapbox
when
the
lights
began
to
wink
out
along
this
highway
of
evil
ghosts
mottka
was
still
to
be
seen
hunched
over
his
chestnut
roaster
and
waiting
policeman
billings
strolling
over
his
beat
was
wont
to
observe
mottka
there
were
many
things
demanding
the
philosophical
attention
of
policeman
billings
not
so
long
ago
the
neighborhood
which
he
policed
had
been
renowned
to
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
as
the
rendezvous
of
more
temptations
than
even
anthony
enumerated
in
his
interesting
brochure
on
the
subject
and
policeman
billings
felt
the
presence
of
much
of
this
evil
lingering
in
the
brick
walls
broken
windows
and
sagging
pavements
of
the
district
it
was
after
a
number
of
days
on
the
beat
that
policeman
billings
began
to
take
mottka
seriously
there
was
something
curious
about
the
chestnut
vender
and
the
eye
of
the
good
officer
grew
narrow
with
suspicion
this
man
reasoned
policeman
billings
makes
pretense
of
being
a
vender
of
roasted
chestnuts
he
sits
all
day
in
the
alley
between
two
saloons
i
have
never
noticed
him
sell
any
chestnuts
and
come
to
think
of
it
i
have
never
seen
more
than
a
chestnuts
on
his
roasting
pan
i
begin
to
suspect
that
this
old
man
is
a
fraud
and
that
his
roasting
chestnuts
is
a
blind
he
is
very
likely
a
lookout
for
some
bootlegger
gang
or
criminal
mob
and
i
will
keep
an
eye
on
him
mottka
remained
unaware
of
policeman
billing
attention
he
continued
to
sit
hunched
over
his
roaster
nursing
the
little
fire
under
it
as
best
he
could
and
waiting
but
finally
policeman
billings
called
himself
to
his
attention
in
no
uncertain
way
what
your
name
asked
the
good
officer
stopping
before
the
chestnut
vender
mottka
answered
mottka
and
what
are
you
doing
here
asked
policeman
billings
frowning
i
roast
chestnuts
and
sell
them
said
mottka
hm
said
policeman
billings
you
do
eh
well
we
see
about
that
come
along
mottka
rose
without
question
one
does
not
ask
questions
of
an
officer
of
the
law
mottka
stood
up
and
put
the
fire
out
and
put
the
handful
of
chestnuts
in
his
pocket
and
picked
up
his
roaster
and
followed
the
officer
a
later
mottka
stood
before
the
sergeant
in
the
street
station
what
the
trouble
asked
the
sergeant
and
policeman
billings
explained
he
claims
to
be
selling
chestnuts
and
roasting
them
but
i
never
see
him
sell
any
much
less
do
i
see
him
roasting
any
he
got
about
a
dozen
chestnuts
altogether
and
i
think
he
may
bear
looking
into
what
about
it
mottka
asked
the
sergeant
mottka
shrugged
his
shoulders
shook
his
head
and
smiled
deprecatingly
nothing
he
said
i
got
a
chestnut
roaster
i
got
from
a
friend
on
the
west
side
and
i
try
to
make
business
i
got
a
license
but
the
officer
says
you
never
roast
any
chestnuts
and
he
thinks
you
a
fake
yes
yes
smiled
mottka
i
do
have
so
many
chestnuts
i
ca
afford
only
a
little
bit
at
a
time
some
time
i
buy
a
basket
of
chestnuts
where
do
you
live
mottka
oh
on
the
west
side
on
the
west
side
and
what
did
you
do
before
you
roasted
chestnuts
me
oh
i
was
in
a
business
yes
in
a
business
and
it
failed
so
i
got
the
chestnut
roaster
i
got
a
license
it
seems
to
me
i
seen
you
before
mottka
yes
yes
a
policeman
bring
me
here
before
when
i
was
on
wabash
avenue
with
my
chestnuts
what
did
he
bring
you
in
for
oh
because
he
thinks
i
am
a
crook
because
i
do
have
enough
chestnuts
to
sell
he
says
i
am
a
lookout
for
crooks
and
he
brings
me
in
mottka
laughed
softly
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
am
no
crook
only
i
am
too
poor
to
buy
more
chestnuts
policeman
billings
frowned
but
not
at
mottka
here
said
the
good
officer
and
he
handed
mottka
a
dollar
three
other
upholders
of
the
law
were
present
and
they
too
handed
mottka
money
go
and
buy
yourself
some
chestnuts
mottka
said
the
sergeant
so
the
officers
wo
be
runnin
you
in
on
suspicion
of
bein
a
criminal
now
mottka
chestnut
roaster
in
the
alley
off
state
street
is
full
of
chestnuts
a
bright
fire
burns
under
the
pan
and
mottka
sits
watching
the
chestnuts
brown
and
peel
as
they
roast
and
if
you
were
to
ask
him
about
things
he
would
say
tell
something
what
is
there
to
tell
nothing
ta
mig
avast
and
belay
there
take
in
the
topgallants
wind
up
the
mizzenmast
and
reef
the
cleets
this
is
tobias
plowing
his
way
through
a
high
sea
in
grand
avenue
aye
what
a
night
what
a
night
the
devil
astride
the
jib
boom
his
tail
lashing
in
the
wind
pokker
says
tobias
ta
mig
hold
tight
and
here
we
go
the
boys
in
the
elite
poolroom
stand
grinning
in
the
doorway
old
norske
tobias
is
on
a
tear
again
his
red
face
shining
with
the
memory
of
stavanger
storms
his
beard
bristling
like
a
north
cat
back
an
odin
in
caricature
they
watch
him
pass
drunker
than
a
fiddler
wench
drunker
than
a
bootlegger
pal
drunk
as
the
devil
himself
and
roaring
at
the
top
of
his
voice
belay
there
hold
tight
and
here
we
go
poor
tobias
the
years
keep
plucking
out
his
hairs
and
twisting
his
fingers
into
talons
seventy
years
have
squeezed
him
and
they
have
brought
him
piety
and
wisdom
they
have
taught
him
virtue
and
holiness
but
the
wind
suddenly
rises
and
comes
blowing
out
of
stavanger
again
the
great
sea
suddenly
lifts
under
his
one
good
leg
and
tobias
with
his
bibles
and
his
prayer
books
struggles
in
the
dark
of
his
grand
avenue
bedroom
the
devil
comes
and
sits
on
his
window
sill
a
devil
with
long
locks
and
bronze
wings
beside
his
ears
and
a
pitchfork
in
his
hand
ho
ho
cries
this
one
on
the
window
sill
what
are
you
doing
here
tobias
with
the
north
wind
blowing
and
the
gray
seas
standing
on
their
heads
grown
old
tobias
eh
sitting
in
a
corner
and
mumbling
over
litanies
and
it
has
always
been
like
that
since
he
came
to
grand
avenue
ten
years
ago
it
has
always
turned
out
that
tobias
takes
off
his
white
shirt
and
puts
on
his
sailor
black
sweater
and
fastens
on
his
old
wooden
leg
and
follows
the
one
on
the
window
sill
avast
and
belay
the
night
is
still
young
and
a
sailor
man
abroad
the
sergeant
going
off
duty
at
the
chicago
avenue
station
passes
and
winks
and
calls
hello
tobias
pretty
rough
tonight
ta
mig
roars
tobias
hold
tight
and
he
steers
for
clark
street
and
now
the
one
on
the
window
sill
is
gone
and
the
storm
grows
quiet
and
poor
tobias
the
venerable
and
pious
who
has
won
the
grace
of
god
through
a
terrific
fight
finds
himself
again
lost
and
strayed
of
what
good
were
the
prayers
and
the
night
after
night
readings
in
the
old
sea
captain
bible
stolen
forty
years
ago
of
what
good
the
promises
and
tears
of
repentance
when
this
thing
that
seemed
to
rise
out
of
forgotten
seas
could
come
and
jump
up
on
his
window
sill
and
bewitch
him
as
if
he
were
a
heedless
boy
when
it
could
sit
laughing
at
him
until
in
its
laugh
he
heard
the
sounds
of
old
winds
roaring
and
old
seas
standing
on
their
heads
and
he
put
on
his
black
sweater
the
badge
of
his
sinfulness
and
he
put
on
his
wooden
leg
and
lifted
out
the
handful
of
money
from
under
the
corner
of
the
carpet
what
good
were
the
prayers
if
they
could
keep
him
pious
yes
that
was
it
and
here
the
habitués
along
north
clark
street
grin
for
tobias
is
coming
down
the
pavement
his
head
hanging
low
his
beard
no
longer
bristling
and
his
soul
on
a
hunt
for
a
new
god
a
strong
god
a
powerful
and
commanding
god
stronger
than
the
one
of
the
window
sill
they
grin
because
this
is
an
old
story
tobias
is
an
old
character
once
every
two
or
three
months
for
ten
years
tobias
has
come
like
this
with
his
head
lowered
searching
for
a
new
and
powerful
god
that
would
keep
him
pious
and
that
would
kill
the
devil
that
seemed
never
to
die
inside
his
old
norske
soul
so
he
had
taken
them
all
a
jumble
of
gods
a
patchwork
of
religions
every
soapbox
apostle
in
the
district
had
at
one
time
converted
him
holy
roller
methodist
jumper
yogi
swami
zionite
he
had
bowed
his
head
before
their
and
a
dozen
other
varied
gods
and
the
missions
in
the
district
had
come
to
know
him
as
the
convert
he
had
been
faithful
to
each
of
the
creeds
as
long
as
he
remained
sober
and
as
long
as
he
sat
in
his
room
of
nights
reading
in
his
bible
but
come
a
storm
out
of
stavanger
come
a
whistling
under
the
eaves
and
a
thumping
of
wind
on
the
window
pane
and
tobias
was
off
again
he
is
not
a
good
god
tobias
would
cry
in
his
new
repentance
his
religion
is
too
weak
the
devil
is
stronger
than
him
i
want
a
stronger
religion
pagh
i
want
somebody
big
enough
to
kill
this
fanden
inside
me
the
crowd
around
the
soapbox
evangelist
is
rather
slight
the
night
is
cold
the
wind
bites
and
the
street
has
a
dismal
air
the
evangelist
stands
around
the
corner
from
the
old
book
store
in
whose
windows
thousands
of
musty
volumes
are
piled
like
the
bones
of
hermits
the
man
who
owns
this
curious
book
store
is
a
and
the
evangelist
on
the
soapbox
is
a
friend
of
his
the
slight
crowd
listens
peace
comes
from
the
sun
the
sun
is
the
source
of
light
and
of
health
it
is
the
eye
of
god
terrible
by
day
and
watching
by
night
it
is
the
fire
of
life
the
slight
crowd
grins
and
the
evangelist
his
mind
bubbling
with
a
cabalistic
jargon
remembered
out
of
musty
books
tries
to
explain
something
that
seems
vivid
in
his
heart
but
vague
to
his
tongue
they
will
drop
away
soon
because
the
night
is
cold
and
the
evangelist
a
bit
too
nutty
for
serious
attention
but
here
comes
tobias
and
some
of
the
listeners
grin
and
nudge
one
another
tobias
with
his
voice
hoarse
and
his
blue
eyes
shining
with
wrath
wrath
at
himself
and
wrath
at
the
god
who
had
abandoned
him
unable
to
cope
with
the
one
on
the
window
sill
tobias
listens
terrible
by
day
and
ever
watchful
by
night
the
king
of
kings
the
great
majesty
and
secret
symbol
of
the
absolute
tobias
drinks
in
the
jargon
of
the
soapbox
man
and
then
shouts
i
join
i
join
i
want
a
strong
god
so
now
tobias
is
a
the
boys
in
the
elite
poolroom
will
tell
you
all
about
it
how
he
walks
the
street
at
dawn
with
his
head
raised
and
bows
every
seven
steps
and
how
in
the
evening
he
is
to
be
seen
standing
at
his
window
bowing
to
the
sun
going
down
and
how
he
has
been
around
saying
well
i
have
found
the
big
god
at
last
no
more
monkey
business
for
me
listen
to
what
it
says
in
the
book
about
him
and
how
he
will
quote
from
the
sea
captain
bible
stolen
forty
years
ago
but
the
boys
also
say
just
wait
and
they
wink
meaning
that
another
storm
will
blow
up
out
of
stavanger
in
norway
and
old
tobias
will
come
plowing
down
the
street
again
howling
that
ta
mig
the
devil
has
him
and
that
old
thor
leaped
on
his
window
sill
and
tossed
the
sun
out
of
the
sky
with
his
hammer
fantastic
lollypops
they
will
never
start
no
they
will
never
start
in
another
two
minutes
prokofieff
will
go
mad
they
should
have
started
at
eleven
it
is
now
ten
minutes
after
eleven
and
they
have
not
yet
started
ah
prokofieff
has
gone
mad
but
prokofieff
is
a
modernist
so
nobody
pays
much
attention
musicians
are
all
mad
and
a
modernist
musician
du
lieber
gott
a
russian
modernist
musician
the
medieval
face
of
boris
anisfeld
pops
over
the
rows
of
empty
seats
it
is
very
likely
that
anisfeld
will
also
go
mad
for
anisfeld
is
in
a
way
a
collaborator
of
prokofieff
it
is
the
full
dress
rehearsal
of
the
love
for
three
oranges
prokofieff
wrote
the
words
and
music
anisfeld
painted
the
scenery
mees
garden
weel
be
hear
in
a
meenute
the
medieval
face
of
boris
whispers
into
the
muscovite
ears
of
serge
and
miss
garden
has
arrived
she
is
armed
having
brought
along
her
heaviest
shillalah
prokofieff
is
on
his
feet
he
takes
off
his
coat
the
medieval
face
of
anisfeld
vanishes
tap
tap
on
the
conductor
stand
lights
out
a
fanfare
from
the
orchestra
right
last
rehearsal
for
the
world
premier
of
a
modernist
opera
one
winter
morning
years
ago
the
music
critics
of
paris
sat
and
laughed
themselves
green
in
the
face
over
the
incomprehensible
banalities
of
an
impossible
modernist
opera
called
tannhäuser
and
who
will
say
that
critics
have
lost
their
sense
of
humor
there
will
unquestionably
be
laughter
before
this
morning
is
over
music
like
this
has
never
come
from
the
orchestra
pit
of
the
auditorium
strange
combinations
of
sounds
that
seem
to
come
from
street
pianos
new
year
eve
horns
harmonicas
and
musical
beer
steins
that
play
when
you
lift
them
up
prokofieff
waves
his
arms
and
the
sounds
increase
there
is
nothing
difficult
about
this
music
that
is
unless
you
are
unfortunate
enough
to
be
a
music
critic
but
to
the
untutored
ear
there
is
a
charming
capriciousness
about
the
sounds
from
the
orchestra
cadenzas
pirouette
in
the
treble
largos
toboggan
in
the
bass
it
sounds
like
the
picture
of
a
crazy
christmas
tree
drawn
by
a
happy
child
which
is
a
most
peculiar
way
for
music
to
sound
but
attention
the
curtain
is
up
bottle
greens
and
fantastic
reds
here
is
a
scene
as
if
the
music
prokofieff
were
waving
out
of
the
orchestra
had
come
to
life
lines
that
look
like
the
music
sounds
colors
that
embrace
one
another
in
tender
dissonances
yes
like
that
and
here
galubcheck
i
think
it
galubcheck
are
the
actors
what
is
it
all
about
ah
prokofieff
knows
and
boris
knows
and
maybe
the
actors
know
but
all
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
know
is
that
music
and
color
and
a
quaint
almost
gargoylian
caprice
are
tumbling
around
in
front
of
our
eyes
and
ears
and
there
is
jacques
coini
he
will
not
participate
in
the
world
premier
except
in
spirit
now
coini
is
present
in
the
flesh
he
wears
a
business
suit
spats
of
tan
and
a
gray
fedora
coini
is
the
stage
director
he
instructs
the
actors
how
to
act
he
tells
the
choruses
where
to
chorus
and
what
to
do
with
their
hands
masks
feet
voices
eyes
and
noses
the
hobgoblin
extravaganza
prokofieff
wrote
unfolds
itself
with
rapidity
theater
habitués
eavesdropping
on
the
rehearsal
mumble
in
the
that
there
was
never
anything
like
this
seen
on
earth
or
in
heaven
anisfeld
scenery
explodes
like
a
succession
of
medieval
skyrockets
a
phantasmagoria
of
sound
color
and
action
crowds
the
startled
proscenium
for
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
proscenium
with
the
names
of
verdi
bach
haydn
and
beethoven
chiseled
on
it
is
considerably
startled
through
this
business
of
skyrockets
and
crescendos
and
hobgoblins
coini
stands
out
like
a
lighthouse
in
a
cubist
storm
however
bewildering
the
plot
however
the
music
coini
is
intelligible
drama
his
brisk
little
figure
in
its
pressed
pants
spats
and
fedora
bounces
around
amid
the
apoplectic
disturbances
like
some
busybody
alice
in
an
operatic
wonderland
the
opus
mounts
the
music
mounts
singers
attired
as
singers
were
never
attired
before
crawl
on
bounce
on
tumble
on
and
coini
as
undisturbed
as
a
traffic
cop
or
a
loop
pigeon
commands
his
stage
he
tells
the
singers
where
to
stand
while
they
sing
and
when
they
do
sing
to
suit
him
he
sings
himself
he
leads
the
chorus
on
and
tells
it
where
to
dance
and
when
they
do
dance
to
suit
him
he
dances
himself
he
moves
the
scenery
himself
he
fights
with
prokofieff
while
the
music
splashes
and
roars
around
him
he
fights
with
boris
he
fights
with
electricians
and
wigmakers
it
is
admirable
coini
in
his
tan
spats
and
gray
fedora
is
more
fantastic
than
the
entire
cast
of
devils
and
christmas
trees
and
lollypops
who
seem
to
be
the
leading
actors
in
the
play
prokofieff
and
miss
garden
have
made
a
mistake
they
should
have
let
coini
play
the
love
for
three
oranges
all
by
himself
they
should
have
let
him
be
the
and
the
weird
chorus
the
enchantress
and
the
melancholy
prince
coini
is
the
greatest
opera
i
have
ever
seen
all
he
needed
was
prokofieff
music
and
the
superbly
childish
visions
of
the
medieval
boris
for
a
background
the
music
leaps
into
a
gaudy
balloon
and
sails
away
in
marvelous
zigzags
way
over
the
heads
of
the
hobgoblins
on
the
stage
and
the
music
critics
off
the
stage
miss
garden
beckons
with
her
shillalah
prokofieff
arrives
panting
at
her
side
he
bows
kisses
the
back
of
her
hand
and
stands
at
attention
also
the
medieval
face
of
anisfeld
drifts
gently
through
the
gloom
and
joins
the
two
the
first
act
of
the
oranges
is
over
two
critics
exchanging
opinions
glower
at
prokofieff
one
says
what
a
shame
what
a
shame
nobody
will
understand
it
the
other
agrees
but
perhaps
they
only
mean
that
music
critics
will
fail
to
understand
it
and
that
untutored
ones
like
ourselves
will
find
in
the
rhythms
and
contortions
of
prokofieff
and
anisfeld
a
strange
delight
as
if
some
one
had
given
us
a
musical
lollypop
to
suck
and
rub
in
our
hair
i
have
an
interview
with
prokofieff
to
add
the
interview
came
first
and
does
sit
well
at
the
end
of
these
notes
because
prokofieff
sighing
a
bit
nervously
in
expectation
of
the
world
premier
said
i
am
a
classicist
i
derive
from
the
classical
composers
this
may
be
true
but
the
critics
will
question
it
instead
of
quoting
prokofieff
at
this
time
it
may
be
more
apropos
merely
to
say
that
i
would
rather
see
and
listen
to
his
opera
than
to
the
entire
repertoire
of
the
company
put
together
this
is
not
criticism
but
a
prejudice
in
favor
of
fantastic
notes
for
a
tragedy
jan
pedlowski
came
home
yesterday
and
found
that
his
wife
had
run
away
there
was
supper
on
the
table
and
under
the
soup
plate
was
a
letter
addressed
to
jan
it
read
in
polish
i
am
sick
and
tired
you
keep
on
nagging
me
all
the
time
and
i
stand
it
any
more
you
will
be
better
off
without
me
paula
jan
ate
his
supper
and
then
put
his
hat
and
coat
on
and
went
over
to
see
the
sergeant
at
the
west
chicago
avenue
police
station
the
sergeant
appeared
to
be
busy
so
jan
waited
then
he
stepped
forward
and
said
my
wife
has
run
away
i
want
to
catch
her
the
sergeant
was
lacking
in
sympathy
he
told
jan
to
go
home
and
wait
and
that
the
missus
would
probably
come
back
and
that
if
she
did
he
could
get
a
divorce
i
do
want
a
divorce
said
i
want
to
catch
her
but
jan
went
home
it
was
no
use
running
around
looking
for
her
and
losing
sleep
and
besides
he
had
to
be
in
court
tomorrow
the
landlord
had
left
a
notice
that
the
pedlowskis
must
get
out
of
their
flat
because
they
did
pay
their
rent
before
coming
home
jan
had
arranged
with
the
foreman
at
the
plating
works
for
two
hours
off
to
be
taken
out
of
his
pay
he
could
come
to
work
at
seven
and
work
until
nine
then
go
to
court
and
be
back
maybe
by
eleven
so
jan
went
to
bed
he
put
the
letter
his
wife
had
left
in
his
coat
pocket
because
he
had
a
vague
idea
it
might
be
evidence
he
might
show
it
to
somebody
and
maybe
it
would
help
it
was
snowing
when
jan
left
the
plating
works
in
the
morning
to
come
to
court
he
arrived
at
the
city
hall
and
wandered
around
confused
by
the
crowd
of
people
pouring
in
and
out
of
the
elevators
but
it
was
growing
late
and
he
only
had
two
hours
off
so
jan
made
inquiries
where
was
the
court
where
he
should
go
judge
barasa
on
the
eighth
floor
said
the
starter
jan
went
there
a
lot
of
people
were
in
the
court
room
jan
sat
down
among
them
and
looked
like
them
blank
uninterested
as
if
waiting
for
a
train
in
the
railroad
station
one
thing
worried
jan
the
two
hours
off
if
they
did
call
him
he
be
late
and
the
foreman
would
be
mad
he
might
lose
his
job
and
jobs
were
hard
to
get
it
took
five
weeks
to
get
this
one
it
would
take
longer
now
but
they
called
jan
pedlowski
and
he
came
forward
to
where
the
judge
sat
at
first
jan
had
felt
confused
and
frightened
he
had
worried
about
coming
to
court
and
standing
before
the
judge
now
it
seemed
all
right
everybody
was
nice
and
businesslike
a
lawyer
said
there
almost
two
months
rent
due
now
eighteen
dollars
for
the
november
rent
and
for
december
can
you
pay
the
rent
the
judge
asked
of
jan
looked
and
blinked
and
tried
to
think
of
something
to
say
he
could
only
think
of
my
wife
paula
ran
away
last
night
here
she
wrote
this
letter
left
me
on
the
table
when
i
come
home
last
night
i
see
said
the
judge
but
what
about
the
rent
if
i
give
you
until
january
do
you
think
you
can
pay
it
i
do
know
said
jan
rubbing
his
eyes
i
got
job
now
but
they
going
to
layoff
after
new
year
if
i
have
job
i
pay
it
all
i
can
pay
now
have
you
got
it
with
you
asked
the
judge
yes
said
i
was
going
to
buy
christmas
present
for
paula
but
she
ran
away
jan
handed
over
the
and
listened
to
the
judge
explain
that
he
would
be
allowed
to
stay
where
he
was
until
january
and
have
till
then
to
pay
his
rent
when
this
was
over
he
walked
out
putting
his
hat
on
too
soon
so
that
the
bailiff
cried
hats
off
in
the
courtroom
jan
grabbed
his
hat
and
grew
red
now
he
had
almost
a
full
hour
and
a
half
before
going
to
the
factory
it
had
taken
less
time
than
he
thought
jan
started
to
walk
it
was
cold
and
the
streets
were
slippery
he
walked
along
with
his
hands
in
the
frayed
pockets
of
his
overcoat
and
his
breath
congealing
over
his
walrus
mustache
his
eyes
were
set
and
his
face
serious
jan
thoughts
were
simple
rent
paula
jobs
christmas
perhaps
too
but
he
walked
along
like
anybody
else
in
the
loop
jan
wandered
as
far
as
quincy
and
la
salle
streets
here
he
stopped
and
looked
around
it
was
beginning
to
snow
heavier
now
he
stood
still
like
a
man
waiting
and
having
nothing
to
do
he
took
the
letter
his
wife
had
left
under
the
soup
plate
and
read
it
again
when
jan
had
folded
the
letter
up
and
started
to
walk
once
more
his
eyes
suddenly
lighted
up
he
turned
and
started
to
run
and
as
he
ran
he
cried
paula
paula
some
of
the
crowd
moving
on
paused
and
looked
at
a
stocky
man
with
a
heavy
mustache
running
across
the
street
and
shouting
a
name
the
cabs
were
thick
at
the
moment
and
it
was
hard
running
across
but
jan
kept
on
his
overcoat
flapping
behind
him
and
his
short
legs
jumping
up
and
down
as
he
moved
a
young
woman
with
a
cheap
fur
around
her
neck
had
stopped
there
were
others
who
paused
to
watch
jan
but
this
young
woman
was
one
of
the
few
who
did
smile
she
waited
as
if
puzzled
for
a
moment
and
then
started
to
lose
herself
in
the
crowd
she
walked
swiftly
ahead
her
eyes
anxiously
on
the
corner
and
in
the
meantime
jan
came
galumphing
toward
the
curbing
still
crying
paula
paula
at
the
curbing
however
jan
came
to
a
full
stop
his
toe
had
caught
the
cement
and
he
shot
forward
landing
on
his
hands
and
chin
a
crowd
gathered
around
jan
and
some
one
helped
him
to
his
feet
his
chin
was
bleeding
and
his
hands
were
scraped
from
hitting
the
cold
pavement
he
made
no
sign
however
of
injury
but
stood
blinking
in
the
direction
the
young
woman
with
the
cheap
fur
had
gone
a
policeman
arrived
and
inquired
sympathetically
what
was
wrong
jan
brushed
himself
mechanically
as
the
policeman
spoke
then
he
answered
nothing
i
fell
down
the
policeman
went
away
and
jan
turned
back
to
catch
a
milwaukee
avenue
street
car
he
stood
on
the
corner
waiting
and
fingering
his
bruised
chin
he
seemed
to
be
getting
impatient
as
the
car
failed
to
appear
finally
he
thrust
his
hand
inside
his
pocket
and
drew
out
the
letter
again
he
held
it
without
reading
for
an
instant
and
then
tore
it
up
when
the
car
came
jan
was
still
tearing
up
the
letter
his
thick
fingers
trying
vainly
to
divide
it
into
tinier
bits
coral
amber
and
jade
there
are
no
gold
and
scarlet
lanterns
bobbing
like
fat
little
oriental
pierrots
over
this
street
no
firecracker
colors
daub
its
sad
walls
walk
the
whole
length
and
not
a
dragon
or
a
thumbnail
balcony
or
a
pigtail
will
you
see
instead
a
very
efficient
very
conservative
chinatown
and
a
colony
of
very
efficient
and
very
chinamen
who
have
gradually
taken
possession
of
a
small
district
around
street
and
wentworth
avenue
a
rather
famous
district
in
its
way
where
once
the
tenderloin
put
forth
its
red
shadows
but
now
as
you
walk
the
night
stares
evilly
out
of
wooden
ruins
stretches
of
sagging
empty
buildings
whose
windows
and
doors
seem
to
have
been
chewed
away
an
intimidating
silence
a
graveyard
of
crumbling
little
houses
these
remain
and
you
see
venus
grown
old
and
toothless
snoozing
amid
the
debris
of
another
day
then
the
chinamen
begin
lights
twinkle
interiors
and
carefully
washed
store
windows
roofs
have
been
hammered
back
in
place
stairways
nailed
together
again
the
sagging
walls
and
lopsided
cottages
have
taken
a
new
lease
on
life
another
of
the
innumerable
little
business
districts
that
dot
the
city
has
fought
its
way
into
evidence
there
are
few
oddities
through
the
glass
of
the
store
fronts
you
see
curiously
immobile
groups
men
seated
in
chairs
smoking
long
pipes
and
waiting
in
silence
strange
fruits
foods
herbs
cloths
trinkets
lie
on
the
orderly
shelves
around
them
the
floors
look
scrubbed
and
there
is
an
absence
of
litter
it
is
all
very
efficient
and
very
natural
except
for
the
immobility
of
the
men
in
the
chairs
and
the
silence
that
seems
to
have
descended
on
them
a
chinese
silence
and
if
you
linger
in
the
neighborhood
you
begin
to
feel
that
this
is
more
chinese
than
the
gaudy
dragons
and
the
firecracker
daubs
and
the
bobbing
paper
lanterns
of
fiction
this
night
i
am
looking
for
billy
lee
no
wentworth
avenue
says
lee
card
we
are
to
talk
over
some
matters
one
of
which
has
already
been
made
public
others
of
which
may
never
be
he
sits
in
his
inner
office
attired
like
a
very
efficient
american
business
man
does
lee
we
say
hello
and
start
the
talk
in
the
rooms
outside
the
inner
office
are
a
dozen
chinese
but
there
is
no
sound
they
are
sitting
in
chairs
or
standing
up
all
smoking
all
silent
a
sense
of
strange
preoccupation
lies
over
the
place
yet
one
feels
that
the
twelve
silent
men
are
preoccupied
with
nothing
except
possibly
the
fact
that
they
are
chinese
lee
himself
is
none
too
garrulous
we
have
been
talking
for
several
minutes
when
he
becomes
totally
silent
and
after
a
long
pause
hands
me
a
cablegram
the
cablegram
reads
hongkong
ying
yan
bandits
captured
foo
wing
and
wife
send
immediately
signed
taichow
i
just
received
this
says
lee
ying
yan
is
my
father
foo
wing
is
my
brother
his
american
name
is
andrew
lee
he
went
to
hongkong
ten
months
ago
and
was
married
this
is
terrible
i
am
worried
to
death
lee
appears
to
sink
into
a
studious
calm
his
eyes
regard
the
cablegram
stolidly
he
remarks
at
length
bad
news
this
is
very
bad
news
from
outside
comes
a
sudden
singsong
of
chinese
one
of
the
twelve
men
has
said
something
he
finishes
silence
resumes
there
seems
to
be
no
answer
lee
puts
the
cablegram
back
in
his
pocket
and
some
one
knocks
on
the
door
come
in
says
lee
a
chinese
youth
enters
he
carries
a
bundle
meet
tang
says
billy
lee
we
shake
hands
and
tang
begins
talking
in
chinese
lee
listens
nods
his
head
and
then
holds
out
his
hand
for
the
bundle
this
is
a
very
interesting
event
says
lee
in
english
tang
is
just
over
from
the
orient
he
comes
from
north
of
china
from
wu
chang
where
the
revolution
started
you
know
he
has
with
him
a
very
interesting
matter
lee
unwraps
the
bundle
he
removes
a
long
necklace
made
of
curiously
carved
wooden
beads
large
balls
of
jade
and
pendants
of
silk
and
stones
next
he
removes
a
second
necklace
somewhat
longer
than
the
first
it
is
made
of
marvelously
matched
amber
beads
balls
of
jade
and
pendants
of
coral
a
very
interesting
matter
says
lee
tang
is
son
of
a
formerly
very
wealthy
and
mandarin
family
but
his
family
has
lost
everything
and
tang
is
here
seeking
an
education
in
modern
business
he
has
left
of
his
family
wealth
only
these
two
things
here
they
are
necklaces
such
as
only
mandarins
could
wear
when
they
appeared
before
the
emperor
in
court
in
the
old
days
you
see
these
have
three
pendants
so
they
show
the
mandarin
was
a
gentleman
of
the
third
class
under
the
emperor
they
have
been
in
tang
family
possession
for
generations
you
will
notice
this
one
of
carved
beads
is
made
of
beads
which
are
formed
from
the
pits
of
the
chinese
olive
there
are
two
hundred
beads
and
on
each
is
carved
some
figure
or
scene
which
in
all
represent
the
history
of
china
lee
holds
the
two
necklaces
in
his
hand
tang
stands
by
silently
his
eyes
gaze
at
the
beads
your
father
wore
them
at
court
inquires
lee
in
the
manner
of
a
host
tang
nods
his
head
slowly
and
adds
a
word
in
chinese
he
says
his
family
wore
them
for
generations
explains
lee
now
the
family
is
vanished
and
all
that
is
left
are
these
insignia
of
their
nobility
and
tang
wishes
me
to
dispose
of
them
for
him
so
he
may
have
money
to
go
to
school
lee
and
tang
are
then
both
silent
lee
slips
one
of
the
necklaces
over
his
head
it
hangs
down
over
his
american
coat
and
american
silk
shirt
in
a
rather
incongruous
way
but
there
seems
to
be
nothing
incongruous
in
the
matter
for
lee
and
tang
billy
lee
with
the
necklace
around
his
neck
the
three
mandarin
pendants
against
his
belt
looks
at
tang
and
tang
bows
and
leaves
our
matters
have
been
fully
discussed
and
i
follow
a
later
there
are
still
twelve
men
in
the
room
they
stand
and
sit
and
smoke
none
speaks
i
notice
in
the
group
the
immobile
figure
of
tang
he
is
smoking
an
american
cigarette
one
of
the
twelve
silently
preoccupied
residents
of
chinatown
who
have
gathered
in
billy
lee
place
to
wait
for
something
meditation
in
e
minor
well
well
well
the
lady
pianist
will
now
oblige
with
something
very
refined
when
in
the
name
of
gods
of
reason
will
i
ever
learn
enough
to
stay
at
home
and
go
to
bed
instead
of
searching
kittenishly
for
diversion
in
neighborhood
movie
and
vaudeville
houses
no
wrong
the
lady
is
not
a
pianist
she
is
merely
an
accompanist
she
is
going
to
accompany
something
on
cares
they
are
no
more
than
the
ripples
which
one
ego
a
face
two
hundred
and
years
old
if
a
day
aha
his
nobs
a
fiddler
silver
threads
among
the
gold
and
something
fancy
from
the
opera
and
all
dressed
up
in
his
wedding
suit
the
white
tie
is
a
bit
soiled
and
the
white
vest
longs
mutely
for
the
laundryman
and
if
he
going
to
wear
a
dress
suit
if
he
insists
upon
wearing
a
dress
suit
why
does
he
press
his
pants
but
how
did
a
man
with
a
face
like
this
ever
happen
to
think
he
could
fiddle
an
english
nobleman
or
maybe
a
swedish
nobleman
hm
a
very
interesting
face
a
little
bit
touched
with
flabbiness
and
somewhat
soiled
intangibly
soiled
like
an
english
nobleman
or
a
swedish
nobleman
who
has
stayed
up
all
night
drinking
and
he
holds
his
fiddle
in
an
odd
way
like
what
well
like
a
fiddler
like
a
marvelous
fiddler
it
hangs
limply
from
his
hand
as
if
it
were
nonexistent
kreisler
holds
his
fiddle
like
that
a
blond
mustache
and
the
beginnings
of
a
paunch
nevertheless
a
very
refined
gentleman
a
baron
somewhat
the
worse
for
a
night
of
bourbon
the
idiotic
orchestra
the
idiotic
orchestra
did
anybody
ever
hear
such
an
idiotic
orchestra
three
violins
one
cello
one
cornet
one
flute
and
a
drum
all
out
of
tune
all
out
of
time
the
prelude
and
his
nobs
grins
poor
fellow
but
who
taught
him
how
to
hold
a
fiddle
like
that
we
off
an
e
minor
chord
from
our
friend
at
the
piano
hm
something
classical
ho
ho
viotti
well
well
here
a
howdeedo
his
nobs
is
going
to
play
the
concerto
good
luck
and
god
bless
him
if
i
was
in
bed
if
i
was
in
bed
i
would
have
to
listen
to
a
refined
gentleman
with
his
swell
pants
unpressed
murdering
poor
viotti
a
swell
gentleman
with
his
eyes
carefully
made
up
i
did
notice
his
eyes
before
all
set
paganini
your
turn
let
go
ah
that
was
a
note
well
well
well
his
nobs
can
play
hm
a
cadenza
in
double
stops
and
the
e
minor
scale
in
harmonics
listen
to
the
baron
in
the
dirty
white
vest
the
man
a
violinist
observe
calisthenics
on
the
g
string
and
in
the
second
position
a
very
difficult
position
and
easily
faked
and
when
did
heifetz
ever
take
a
run
like
that
up
down
and
the
fingers
hammering
like
thoroughbreds
on
a
fast
track
pizzicato
with
the
left
hand
and
obbligato
glissando
hoopla
the
fellow
showing
off
and
it
is
a
drdla
souvenir
or
a
vaudeville
brahms
arrangement
but
twenty
years
of
practice
yes
sir
there
are
twenty
years
and
eight
hours
a
day
every
day
for
twenty
years
in
these
acrobatics
there
are
twenty
years
twenty
years
behind
this
technique
and
years
but
tell
me
cyril
for
whom
is
our
baron
showing
off
for
whom
our
baron
with
the
soiled
tie
and
the
eyes
fiddling
coldly
elaborately
for
a
handful
of
annoyed
flappers
amused
shoe
clerks
and
bored
home
lovers
sitting
stolidly
in
the
dark
waiting
stolidly
and
defiantly
to
be
diverted
bravo
five
of
us
applaud
no
six
a
gentleman
in
an
upper
box
applauds
with
some
degree
of
violence
and
there
is
the
orchestra
leader
a
youth
nodding
and
smiling
next
on
the
program
ah
a
ballad
a
thing
the
cabaret
ladies
sing
do
you
think
of
me
a
faint
smile
on
our
baron
face
but
the
fiddle
leaps
into
position
as
if
for
another
cold
elaborate
attack
it
takes
twenty
years
twenty
years
to
learn
to
hold
a
bow
like
that
firmly
casually
indifferently
as
one
holds
a
pencil
between
one
fingers
admission
cents
including
war
tax
but
this
is
worth
well
it
is
what
the
novelists
call
an
illuminating
experience
this
gentleman
of
music
whose
fingers
have
for
twenty
years
absorbed
the
souls
of
beethoven
and
sarasate
liszt
and
moussorgski
this
aristocrat
of
the
catgut
is
posturing
sardonically
before
the
three
bored
fates
he
is
pouring
twenty
years
twenty
years
into
a
tawdry
little
ballad
ah
how
our
baron
fiddle
sings
and
the
darkened
faces
in
front
hum
to
themselves
when
you
with
another
do
you
ever
think
of
me
yes
my
baron
there
a
question
do
you
we
out
front
all
have
our
little
underworlds
in
which
we
live
sometimes
while
music
plays
and
beautiful
things
come
to
our
eyes
and
yours
this
alley
ballad
throbbing
liquidly
from
the
strings
of
your
fiddle
when
with
another
do
you
ever
think
of
me
of
the
twenty
years
the
twenty
years
of
the
soul
that
your
fingers
captured
of
the
dream
that
took
form
in
your
firm
wrist
and
now
the
chorus
once
more
in
double
stops
in
harmonics
with
arpeggios
thrown
in
and
once
more
largo
sure
and
full
sobbing
organ
notes
whimpering
grace
notes
superb
baron
and
done
with
a
half
smile
at
the
darkened
faces
out
front
the
tired
faces
that
blinked
stolidly
at
viotti
a
smile
at
the
orchestra
leader
who
stands
with
his
mouth
open
waiting
as
if
the
song
were
still
in
the
air
applause
all
of
us
this
time
more
applause
say
this
guy
can
fiddle
he
can
come
on
baron
another
tune
the
tired
faces
yammer
for
another
ditty
träumerei
all
right
let
her
go
paganini
and
after
that
the
missouri
waltz
i
will
stay
for
the
next
show
i
will
stay
for
the
three
shows
and
each
time
this
magnifico
will
come
out
and
make
music
but
better
than
that
i
will
go
back
stage
and
talk
with
him
i
will
ask
him
how
does
it
happen
sir
that
a
man
who
can
fiddle
like
you
a
man
who
could
play
a
duet
with
kreisler
how
does
it
happen
you
fiddling
in
a
neighborhood
movie
and
vaudeville
house
and
he
will
unfold
a
story
yes
there
a
story
there
something
happened
to
this
nobleman
of
the
soiled
white
vest
and
the
marvelous
fingers
there
was
an
occurrence
in
this
man
life
which
would
make
a
good
climax
for
a
second
act
no
that
would
spoil
the
picture
to
find
out
to
learn
the
clumsy
mechanism
behind
this
charming
spectacle
would
take
away
better
like
this
the
lady
at
the
piano
ah
indeed
the
lady
at
the
piano
a
very
elderly
lady
with
a
thin
nose
and
hair
that
was
once
extremely
beautiful
perhaps
she
had
something
to
do
with
it
the
orchestra
pounds
and
scrapes
away
and
the
movie
jumps
around
and
the
heroine
weeps
but
somebody
saves
her
where
there
is
no
faith
there
can
not
be
true
love
confesses
the
hero
folding
her
in
his
arms
and
that
that
now
our
friend
the
baron
again
no
better
to
leave
he
has
left
his
smile
in
the
wings
this
time
he
is
very
serious
or
perhaps
very
tired
two
times
tonight
to
play
too
much
too
much
my
hat
and
i
will
walk
out
on
his
nobs
and
anyway
huneker
wrote
the
story
long
ago
about
a
piano
player
in
coney
island
that
he
called
what
was
it
oh
yes
a
chopin
of
the
gutter
wedding
rings
a
gloomy
day
and
the
loop
streets
grimace
behind
a
mist
the
electric
signs
are
lighted
the
buildings
open
like
great
fans
in
the
half
dark
the
streets
invite
a
mood
of
melodrama
windows
glint
evilly
doorways
grin
with
rows
of
electric
teeth
this
is
the
great
city
of
the
thrillers
the
devourer
of
innocence
the
strumpet
of
stone
i
walk
along
humming
a
bar
of
villainous
music
the
skeeter
scale
that
the
orchestra
used
to
turn
turn
turn
in
the
old
alhambra
as
the
two
dockwallopers
and
the
leering
chinaman
were
climbing
in
through
little
mabel
hall
bedroom
window
to
abduct
her
those
were
happy
days
for
the
drama
when
a
scoundrel
was
a
scoundrel
and
wore
a
silk
hat
to
prove
it
and
a
hero
was
a
man
as
anybody
could
tell
by
a
glance
at
his
marcelled
hair
and
his
shirt
tum
tum
tum
tum
pizzicato
pianissimo
says
the
direction
on
the
score
so
we
are
all
set
for
a
melodrama
here
is
the
great
city
here
are
the
crowds
shuffling
by
under
the
jaundice
glare
of
electric
signs
and
christmas
is
coming
a
vague
gray
snow
trickles
out
of
the
gloom
a
proper
time
for
melodrama
all
we
need
is
a
plot
come
come
now

of

cinderella
wandering
wistfully
in
the

looking
for
a

a

obbligato
by

the
poor

froth
of
merchandise
is
the

ground
of
their
luxuries
this
noisy
store
is
their
horn
of
plenty
a
sad
thought
and
we
dismiss
it
what
we
want
is
plot
perhaps
the
booster
singing
out
of
the
side
of
his

with
tired

at

she
took
my

away
there
are
telephones
all
over
the
walls
and
the
song
voice
pops
out
over
the
section
over
the
and
brassware
section
a
tinny
nasal
voice
with
a
whine
and
a
hoarseness
almost

the

and
the

follow
them
around
follow
them
to
the
counter
where
madge
with
her
japanese
puffs
of
hair
her
wad
of
gum
and
her
black
shirtwaist
that
she
keeps
straightening
out
continually
by
drawing
up
her
bosom
and
pressing
down
on
her
hips
with
her
hands
where
madge
holds
forth
tum
tum
tum
tum
halto
here
is
our
plot
outside
the
pizzicato
of
the
crowds
the
great
city
shining
through
the
mist
the
city
that
has
no
heart
and
here
under
our
nose
twinkling
up
at
our
eyes
a
huge
tray
full
of
wedding
rings
end
of
act
one
act
two
now
madge
the
young
woman
behind
the
counter
love
songs
in
her
ear
and
people
unraveling
faces
unraveling
before
her
who
buys
these
wedding
rings
madge
and
did
you
ever
notice
anything
odd
about
your
customers
and
why
do
you
suppose
they
buy
wedding
rings
madge
just
a
moment
says
madge
what
is
it
miss
a
ring
what
kind
oh
yes
ten
cents
gold
or
platinum
just
the
same
yes
two
giggling
girls
move
off
and
madge
chewing
gently
on
her
wad
of
gum
and
smoothing
her
huge
hair
puffs
out
with
the
coyly
stiffened
palms
of
her
hands
talks
sure
i
get
you
about
the
wedding
rings
sure
that
easy
we
sell
about
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
every
day
oh
mostly
to
kids
girls
and
boys
sometimes
an
old
johnny
comes
in
with
a
fur
collar
and
blows
a
dime
for
a
wedding
ring
but
mostly
girls
i
sometimes
take
a
second
look
at
them
they
usually
giggle
when
they
ask
for
the
ring
and
they
usually
pretend
it
for
somebody
as
a
joke
buying
it
or
sometimes
they
walk
around
the
counter
for
a
half
hour
and
get
me
nervous
as
a
cat
i
know
what
they
want
and
they
ca
get
their
gall
up
to
come
and
ask
for
it
but
finally
they
make
the
break
and
come
up
and
pick
out
a
ring
without
saying
a
word
and
hand
over
ten
cents
there
was
one
girl
no
more
than
sixteen
just
this
morning
she
come
here
all
full
of
pep
and
kidded
about
things
and
said
was
them
platinum
wedding
rings
just
too
grand
for
words
and
so
on
then
she
said
she
wanted
a
of
them
and
was
there
a
discount
when
bought
in
such
quantity
i
started
wrapping
them
up
when
i
looked
at
her
and
she
was
crying
and
she
dropped
her
sixty
cents
on
the
counter
and
said
mind
never
mind
i
do
want
them
i
ca
wear
them
they
only
make
it
worse
a
man
interrupts
what
is
it
sir
asks
madge
anything
in
rings
what
kind
oh
just
plain
rings
says
the
man
with
a
great
show
of
indifference
while
his
eyes
ferret
among
the
trinkets
on
the
counter
and
then
very
calmly
oh
these
will
do
i
guess
two
wedding
rings
and
he
spent
twenty
cents
madge
follows
him
with
her
eyes
that
it
she
whispers
usually
the
men
buy
two
one
for
themselves
and
one
for
the
girl
or
if
it
the
girl
that
buying
them
it
one
for
herself
and
one
for
her
girl
chum
who
going
with
her
and
the
two
fellas
on
the
party
say
take
it
from
me
these
rings
do
ever
hear
no
wedding
marches
back
into
the
gloomy
street
again
a
plot
in
our
head
but
who
the
villain
and
who
the
heroine
and
the
hero
an
easy
answer
to
that
the
crowd
here
sad
faced
the
crowd
continually
dissolving
amid
street
cars
and
autos
is
the
villain
a
crowd
of
shoppers
buying
slippers
for
uncle
and
shawls
for
mother
and
mufflers
for
brother
and
some
bars
of
soap
for
the
bathroom
buying
everything
and
anything
that
fill
the
buildings
with
their
glinting
windows
buying
carpet
sweepers
and
window
curtains
and
linoleum
pizzicato
pianissimo
professor
gigglers
and
dock
wallopers
and
lounge
lizards
and
ones
twenty
a
day
they
sidle
up
to
madge
counter
where
the
love
me
love
me
songs
razz
the
heavy
air
and
shoot
a
dime
for
a
wedding
ring
where
the
blues
sound
that
louis
woman
wid
her
diahmond
rings
pulls
mah
man
by
her
apron
strings
a
voice
screeches
above
the
boom
and
hurrah
of
the
black
and
white
street
cabaret
the
round
tables
rock
waiters
careen
balanced
trays
float
at
crazy
angles
through

of

its
long
hypotenuse
upon
the
floor
in
its
drifting
oval
the
entertainer
her
shoulders
back
her
elbows
out
her
fists
clenched
and
her
body
twisting
into
slow
patterns
bawls
in
a
terrifying
soprano
if
it
ware
foh
her
powdah
and
her
stohe
bought

the
man
ah
love
would
not
have
gone
nowhere
listen
for
the
behind
the
hurrah
watch
for
the
torches
of
kypris
and
corinth
behind
the
glare
of
the
tungstens
this
is
the
immemorial
bacchanal
lurching
through
the
kaleidoscope
of
the
centuries
pan
with
a
bootlegger
grin
and
a
checked
suit
dionysius
with
a
saxophone
to
his
lips

called
now
the
shimmie
listen
and
watch
and
through
the
tumult
rising
like
a
strange
incense
from
the
smear
of
bodies
tables
and
waiters
will
come
the
curious
thing
that
is
never
contained
in
the
vice
reports
the
gleam
of
the
devil
himself
the
echo
of
some
mystic
cymbal
note
later
the
music
will
let
out
a
tinny
blaze
of
sound
men
and
women
will
press
together
and
a
pack
of
bodies
will
sway
on
the
dance
floor
the
tungstens
will
go
out
and
the
spotlight
will
throw
colors
green
purple
lavender
blue
violet
and
as
the
scene
grows
darker
and
the
colors
revolve
a
howl
will
fill
the
place
but
on
the
dance
floor
a
silence
will
fasten
itself
over
the
swaying
bodies
and
there
will
be
only
the
sound
of
feet
pushing
the
silence
of
a
ritual
faces
stiffened
eyes
rolling
a
rigid
embrace
of
men
and
women
creeping
cunningly
among
the
revolving
colors
and
the
whiplike
rhythms
of
the
jazz
band
lost
souls
says
the
vice
reports
and
the
vice
reports
speak
with
a
calm
and
knowing
voice
women
whose
bodies
and
faces
are
like
shells
of
evil
vicious
seeming
men
with
a
rasp
in

are

sung
to
them
little
towns

grinned
at
them
mountains
valleys
forests
and
stars
have
danced
across
their
windshield
the
newspaper
man
stood
watching
them
haul
up
to
the
adams
street
curb
his
heart
was
tired
of
tall
buildings
and
the
endless
grimace
of
windows
here
was
a
chariot
out
of
another
world
motor
vagabonds
scooting
into
a
city
with
a
swagger
to
their
wheels
and
scooting
out
again
the
newspaper
man
thought
the
world
is
buried
yet
there
still
a
restlessness
left
things
change
from
triremes
to
motor
boats
from
rosinante
to
automobiles
but
adventure
merely
mounts
a
new
seat
and
goes
on
dick

it
once
i
am
fevered
with
the
sunset
i
am
fretful
with
the
bay
for
the
wander
thirst
is
on
me
and
my
soul
is
in
cathay
the
five
merry
travelers
crawled
out
and
stretched
themselves
they
doffed
their
goggles
and
slipped
off
their
linen
dusters
and
changed
forthwith
from
a
group
of
flying
gnomes
into
five
citizens
of
california
two
middle
aged
women
two
men
and
a
son
one
of
the
men

the
newspaper

to
himself
what

ring

story
of
the
modern
wanderlust

not
averse
to
publicity
seeing

two
to
coast
pennants
on
the
back
of
their
machine

they

why
they
journeyed
a
tirade
against
the
monotony
of
business
and
i

in
one
of
hovey
stanzas
the
one
that
goes

schooner
in
the
offing
with

newspaper
men
are
perhaps
the
only
creatures
who
as
a
type
never
learn
how
to
ask
questions
an
embarrassment
caused
by
the
stupidity
of
the
gabby
great
whom
they
interrogate
daily
puts
a
crimp
into
their
tongues
their
questions
wince
in
anticipation
of
the
banalities
they
are
doomed
to
elicit
their
curiosity
collapses
under
the
shadow
of
the
inevitable
impending
bromide
thus
the
newspaper
man
wearily
certain
that
regardless
of
what
he
asks
or
how
he
asks
it
he
will
hear
for
answers
only
the
clumsy
asininities
behind
which
the
personalities
leaders
and
sacred
white
cows
pompously
attitudinize
gets
so
that
he
mumbles
a
bit
incoherently
but
here
was
a
different
case
here
were
merry
travelers
with
memories
of
valleys
and
mountains
to
chatter
on
so
the
newspaper
man
unearthed
his
vocabulary
tilted
his
hat
a
trifle
and
smiled
invitingly
well
said
he
to
the
spokesman
of
the
wanderers
the
kind
of
story
like
to
get
would
be
a
story
about
five
people
wandering
across
the
country
you
know
hills
sunsets
trees
and
how
those
things
drive
away
the
monotony
that
fills
up
the
hearts
of
city
folk
what
you
enjoyed
on
the
trip
and
the
advantages
of
a
rover
over
a
statistician
an
eloquence
was
beginning
to
skip
around
on
the
newspaper
man
tongue
his
heart
weary
of
tall
buildings
and
the
endless
grimace
of
city
windows
began
to
warm
under
the
visions
his
phrases
aroused
then
he
paused
one
of
the
women
had
interrupted
go
on
martin
you
can
tell
him
all
that
and
do
forget
about
the
lovely
hotel
breakfast
room
in
des
moines
martin
however
hesitated
he
was
a
man
with
expansive
features
almost
devoid
of
expression
suddenly
his
face
lighted
up
his
hands
jumped
together
and
he
rubbed
their
palms
enthusiastically
i
see
he
said
with
profundity
i
see
yes
breathed
the
newspaper
man
well
said
stevers
the
first
thing
i
like
to
tell
you
young
man
is
about
the
car
you
wo
believe
this
but
we
been
making
twenty
miles
on
a
gallon
that
is
averaging
twenty
miles
on
each
and
every
gallon
sir
since
we
left
san
francisco
pretty
good
eh
on
a
piece
of
scratch
paper
the
newspaper
man
obediently
wrote
twenty
miles
gallon
and
then
went
on
the
spokesman
for
the
wanderers
our
speed
eh
like
to
know
that
well
without
stretching
the
thing
at
all
and
you
can
verify
it
from
any
of
my
party
we
averaged
miles
an
hour
all
the
time
out
i
tell
you
the
old
boat
had
to
travel
some
to
do
that
miles
scribbled
the
newspaper
man
adding
after
it
the
man
an
idiot
stevers
unmindful
loosened
up
the
price
of
gasoline
the
price
of
breakfasts
the
condition
of
the
roads
how
long
a
stretch
they
had
been
able
to
do
without
a
halt
how
many
hours
a
day
he
himself
had
stuck
at
the
wheel
when
he
had
finished
the
newspaper
man
bowed
and
walked
abruptly
away
the
newspaper
man
thoughts
form
a
conclusion
it
true
then
he
thought
the
world
becoming
as
stupid
as
it
looks
people
are
drying
up
inside
with
facts
figures
dollar
signs
this
man
and
his
party
would
have
got
as
much
out
of
their
trip
if
they
all
been
blindfolded
and
shot
through
a
tunnel
two
thousand
feet
under
the
ground
man
is
like
an
audience
and
he
has
walked
out
on
mystery
and
adventure
the
show
kind
of
tired
him
and
got
his
goat
it
would
have
been
a
good
yarn
otherwise
the
motor
vagabonds
i
have
ended
with
hovey
verse
i
must
forth
again
tomorrow
with
the
sunset
i
must
be
hull
down
on
the
trail
of
rapture
in
the
wonder
of
the
sea
mumbling
the
lines
to
himself
the
newspaper
man
strode
on
through
the
crowded
loop
with
a
sudden
swagger
in
his
eyes
nirvana
the
newspaper
man
felt
a
bit
pensive
he
sat
in
his
bedroom
frowning
at
his
typewriter
about
eight
years
ago
he
had
decided
to
write
a
novel
not
that
he
had
anything
particular
in
his
mind
to
write
about
but
the
city
was
such
a
of
dreams
tragedies
fantasies
such
a
crazy
monotone
of
streets
and
windows
that
it
filled
the
newspaper
man
thought
from
day
to
day
with
an
irritating
blur
and
for
eight
years
or
so
the
newspaper
man
had
been
fumbling
around
trying
to
get
it
down
on
paper
but
no
novel
had
grown
out
of
the
blur
in
his
head
the
newspaper
man
put
on
his
last
year
straw
hat
and
went
into
the
street
taking
his
pensiveness
with
him
warm
rows
of
arc
lights
a
shifting
crowd
there
are
some
streets
that
draw
aimless
feet
the
blazing
store
fronts
clothes
shops
candy
shops
victrola
shops
movie
theatres
invite
with
the
promise
of
a
saturnalia
in
suspense
at
wilson
avenue
and
sheridan
road
the
newspaper
man
paused
here
the
loneliness
he
had
felt
in
his
bedroom
seemed
to
grow
more
acute
not
only
his
own
aimlessness
but
the
aimlessness
of
the
staring
smiling
crowd
afflicted
him
then
out
of
the
babble
of
faces
he
heard
his
name
called
a
rouged
young
flapper
high
heeled
short
skirted
and
a
jaunty
green
hat
one
of
the
impudent
little
swaggering
boulevard
promenaders
who
talk
like
simpletons
and
dance
like
salomes
who
laugh
like
parrots
and
ogle
like
pierettes
the
birdlike
strut
of
her
silkened
legs
the
brazen
lure
of
her
stenciled
child
face
the
lithe
grimace
of
her
adolescent
body
under
the
stiff
coloring
of
her
clothes
were
a
part
of
the
blur
in
the
newspaper
mind
she
was
one
of
the
things
he
fumbled
for
on
the
typewriter
one
of
the
city
products
born
of
the
tinpan
bacchanal
of
the
cabarets
a
sort
of
frontispiece
for
an
irving
berlin
ballad
the
caricature
of
savagery
that
danced
to
the
caricature
of
music
from
the
jazz
bands
the
newspaper
man
smiled
looking
at
her
he
understood
her
but
she
would
not
fit
into
the
typewritten
phrases
wilson
avenue
he
thought
as
he
walked
beside
her
chatter
the
wise
brazen
little
virgins
who
shimmy
and
toddle
but
never
pay
the
fiddler
she
it
selling
her
ankles
for
a
glass
of
pop
and
her
eyes
for
a
fox
trot
unhuman
little
piece
a
cross
between
a
macaw
and
a
marionette
thus
the
newspaper
man
thinking
and
the
flapper
flapping
they
came
together
to
a
cabaret
in
the
neighborhood
the
orchestra
filled
the
place
with
confetti
of
sound
laughter
shouts
a
leap
of
voices
blazing
lights
perspiring
waiters
faces
and
hats
thrusting
vivid
stencils
through
the
uncoiling
tinsel
of
tobacco
smoke
on
the
dance
floor
bodies
hugging
toddling
shimmying
faces
fastened
together
eyes
glassy
with
incongruous
ecstasies
the
newspaper
man
ordered
two
drinks
of
moonshine
and
let
the
scene
blur
before
him
like
a
colored
picture
puzzle
out
of
focus
above
the
music
he
heard
the
childishly
strident
voice
of
the
flapper
where
you
been
hiding
yourself
i
thought
you
and
i
were
cookies
well
that
the
way
with
you
johns
but
there
enough
to
go
around
you
can
bet
say
boy
i
met
the
classiest
john
the
other
evening
in
front
of
the
hopper
did
he
have
class
boy
you
know
there
are
some
of
these
fancy
johns
who
look
like
they
were
the
class
but
are
they
ask
me
nix
and
do
i
give
them
the
berries
quick
say
i
do
let
any
john
get
moldy
on
me
soon
as
i
see
they
heading
for
a
dumb
time
i
say
and
off
your
little
sugar
toddles
how
old
are
you
inquired
the
newspaper
man
abstractedly
eighteen
nosey
why
the
insult
i
got
a
new
job
yesterday
with
the
telephone
company
that
makes
my
sixth
job
this
year
tell
me
that
going
good
one
of
the
johns
i
met
in
front
of
the
edgewater
steered
me
to
it
he
turned
out
kind
of
moldy
and
say
he
was
dumb
but
i
played
along
and
got
the
job
say
i
bet
you
never
noticed
my
swell
kicks
the
flapper
thrust
forth
her
legs
and
twirled
her
feet
classy
eh
they
go
with
the
lid
pretty
nice
say
you
kind
of
dumb
yourself
you
got
moldy
since
i
saw
you
last
how
you
remember
my
name
inquired
the
newspaper
man
oh
there
are
some
johns
who
tip
over
the
oil
can
right
from
the
start
and
you
never
forget
them
nobody
could
forget
you
handsome
never
no
more
never
what
do
you
say
to
another
shot
of
hootch
the
getting
rottener
and
rottener
do
you
think
come
on
swallow
how
oh
ai
we
got
fun
the
orchestra
paused
it
resumed
the
crowd
thickened
shouts
laughter
swaying
bodies
a
tinkle
of
glassware
snort
of
trombones
whang
of
banjos
the
newspaper
man
looked
on
and
listened
through
a
film
the
brazen
patter
of
his
young
friend
rippled
on
a
growing
gamin
coarseness
in
her
talk
with
a
nervous
restless
twitter
underneath
her
dark
child
eyes
perverse
under
their
touch
of
black
paint
swung
eagerly
through
the
crowd
her
talk
of
johns
of
dumb
times
and
moldy
times
of
classy
times
and
classy
memories
varied
only
slightly
she
liked
dancing
and
amusement
parks
automobile
riding
not
so
good
and
besides
you
had
to
be
careful
there
were
some
johns
who
thought
it
cute
to
play
caveman
yes
she
had
a
lot
of
close
times
but
they
would
get
her
never
no
never
no
more
anyway
not
while
there
was
music
and
dancing
and
a
in
the
amusement
parks
the
newspaper
man
listening
thought
an
infant
gone
mad
with
her
dolls
or
no
vice
has
lost
its
humanness
she
the
symbol
of
new
sin
the
unhuman
passionless
whirligig
of
baby
girls
and
baby
boys
through
the
cabarets
they
came
back
from
a
dance
and
continued
to
sit
the
din
was
still
mounting
entertainers
fighting
against
the
racket
music
fighting
against
the
racket
bored
men
and
women
finally
achieving
a
bedlam
and
forgetting
themselves
in
the
artifice
of
confusion
the
newspaper
man
looking
at
his
young
friend
saw
her
taking
it
in
there
was
something
he
had
been
trying
to
fathom
about
her
during
her
breathless
chattering
she
talked
danced
whirled
laughed
let
loose
giggling
cries
and
yet
her
eyes
the
part
that
the
rouge
pot
or
the
bead
stick
could
reach
seemed
to
grow
deader
and
deader
the
jazz
band
let
out
the
crash
of
a
new
melody
the
voices
of
the
crowd
rose
in
an
waiters
were
shoving
fresh
tables
into
the
place
squeezing
fresh
arrivals
around
them
the
flapper
had
paused
in
her
breathless
rigmarole
of
johns
and
memories
leaning
forward
suddenly
she
cried
into
the
newspaper
man
ear
above
the
racket
say
this
is
a
dumb
place
the
newspaper
man
smiled
ai
it
though
she
went
on
there
was
a
pause
and
then
the
breathless
voice
sighed
she
spoke
gee
with
a
laugh
that
still
seemed
breathless
gee
but
it
lonely
here
the
indestructible
masterpiece
you
come
with
me
to
the
art
institute
today
said
max
kramm
my
friend
broun
has
an
exhibition
you
know
broun
ah
i
think
he
is
today
the
greatest
living
artist
no
we
will
walk
it
is
only
four
or
five
blocks
and
i
tell
you
a
story
a
story
from
max
kramm
is
worth
attention
even
though
it
is
hot
and
though
the
boul
mich
pavement
feels
like
a
stove
griddle
through
the
leather
of
one
shoes
for
the
max
in
addition
to
being
one
of
the
leading
piano
professors
of
the
country
the
billiard
champion
of
the
chicago
athletic
club
and
the
most
erudite
porcelain
connoisseur
in
harper
avenue
is
one
of
the
survivors
of
the
race
of
raconteurs
that
flourished
in
the
time
of
nickel
cigars
and
the
free
lunch
i
have
eight
more
lessons
to
administer
today
sighed
max
with
a
parting
glower
at
the
premises
of
the
chicago
musical
college
but
when
my
old
friend
broun
has
an
exhibition
i
go
it
was
when
we
lived
together
in
a
studio
in
north
avenue
said
max
jo
davidson
walter
goldbeck
and
the
bunch
we
all
roomed
together
in
the
same
neighborhood
and
we
were
poor
i
can
tell
you
but
young
and
that
makes
up
for
a
lot
of
things
broun
and
i
we
room
together
in
a
little
attic
where
i
have
a
piano
and
he
paints
even
in
those
days
we
all
knew
frank
broun
would
be
a
great
painter
if
he
did
starve
to
death
first
and
the
chances
looked
even
well
there
was
schneider
of
course
you
never
heard
of
him
i
bet
you
no
he
do
paint
and
he
do
sing
and
he
do
play
the
piano
he
was
somebody
much
more
important
than
such
things
schneider
was
the
proprietor
of
a
beer
saloon
in
north
avenue
where
is
he
now
i
wonder
well
in
those
days
he
saved
our
life
twice
a
day
regularly
broun
and
i
we
keep
alive
for
one
whole
year
on
schneider
free
lunch
herring
pickles
rye
bread
pepper
beef
boiled
ham
onions
pretzels
roast
beef
and
a
big
jar
full
of
fine
cheese
and
i
forgot
a
jar
full
of
olives
and
a
dish
of
crackers
oh
there
was
food
fit
for
a
king
in
schneider
you
buy
one
glass
beer
for
five
cents
and
then
you
eat
till
you
bust
for
nothing
you
ca
imagine
what
that
meant
to
us
in
those
days
broun
and
i
we
sometimes
have
so
much
as
ten
cents
a
day
between
us
and
on
this
we
must
live
so
at
noon
we
both
go
into
schneider
broun
says
want
a
drink
max
i
say
frank
then
i
engage
schneider
in
talk
while
broun
makes
away
with
a
meal
then
broun
does
the
talking
and
it
is
my
turn
well
it
got
so
that
the
good
schneider
finally
points
out
to
us
one
day
he
says
frank
i
tell
you
something
you
boys
owe
me
three
dollars
and
you
come
in
here
and
eat
all
your
meals
and
you
do
even
pay
for
the
one
glass
beer
you
buy
any
more
i
am
sorry
but
your
credit
is
exhausted
so
you
can
imagine
what
broun
and
i
feel
when
we
get
home
no
more
schneider
no
more
food
and
eventually
we
see
ourselves
both
starving
to
death
says
broun
have
an
idea
and
he
did
like
all
great
ideas
it
was
simple
broun
figures
that
what
we
need
to
do
is
to
convince
schneider
we
have
wonderful
prospects
and
so
schneider
will
give
us
back
our
credit
so
broun
sits
down
that
day
and
all
day
and
most
of
the
night
he
paints
i
think
it
was
the
last
canvas
he
had
in
the
studio
too
and
a
big
one
you
know
all
of
broun
landscapes
are
big
well
he
paints
and
paints
and
when
he
is
finished
we
take
the
picture
to
schneider
the
two
of
us
carrying
it
i
tell
schneider
that
it
is
one
of
the
old
masters
which
we
just
received
from
berlin
from
my
studio
then
broun
says
that
schneider
must
keep
it
in
his
place
it
is
too
valuable
to
hang
in
our
attic
schneider
looks
at
the
picture
and
it
being
so
big
he
half
believes
it
then
broun
and
i
go
to
the
bank
and
draw
out
our
which
we
have
saved
up
for
a
rainy
day
and
we
go
down
town
and
get
the
picture
insured
for
you
can
imagine
schneider
we
bring
the
insurance
gink
out
there
and
when
he
gives
us
the
policy
and
we
show
it
to
schneider
well
our
credit
is
herring
rye
bread
roast
beef
pickles
and
cheese
once
more
we
eat
schneider
is
more
proud
of
that
picture
than
a
peacock
and
every
day
we
drop
in
to
see
if
it
is
all
right
and
broun
always
goes
behind
the
bar
and
dusts
it
off
a
little
and
draws
himself
another
drink
there
is
never
any
question
any
more
of
our
credit
do
we
own
a
picture
insured
for
the
good
schneider
is
glad
to
have
such
affluent
customers
you
can
believe
me
well
things
go
on
like
this
for
some
months
then
i
am
coming
home
one
night
with
broun
and
the
fire
engines
pass
us
so
frank
and
i
we
go
to
the
fire
it
is
schneider
beer
saloon
we
see
it
a
block
off
frank
turns
pale
and
he
holds
my
arm
and
he
whispers
the
picture
it
is
burning
up
i
look
at
broun
and
i
suppose
i
tremble
a
little
myself
who
would
two
thousand
dollars
says
broun
go
around
the
world
together
and
i
saw
a
suit
today
and
a
cane
i
must
have
but
we
could
talk
we
walk
slowly
to
the
beer
saloon
we
walk
already
like
plutocrats
arm
in
arm
and
our
faces
with
a
faraway
look
we
are
spending
the
two
thousand
you
can
imagine
the
saloon
is
burning
fine
everything
is
going
up
in
smoke
broun
and
i
we
hold
on
to
each
other
we
see
jo
davidson
running
to
the
fire
and
we
nod
at
him
politely
money
makes
a
big
difference
you
know
and
then
we
hear
a
cry
i
recognize
schneider
and
i
see
him
break
loose
from
the
crowd
he
runs
back
into
the
burning
saloon
a
fireman
after
him
broun
and
i
we
stand
and
watch
he
is
probably
gone
after
one
of
his
kids
but
i
count
the
kids
who
are
all
in
the
street
and
they
are
all
there
then
schneider
comes
out
and
the
fireman
too
and
they
are
carrying
something
broun
falls
against
the
delicatessen
store
window
and
groans
and
i
close
my
eyes
yes
it
is
the
picture
schneider
sees
us
and
comes
rushing
he
is
half
burned
up
but
the
picture
is
not
touched
he
and
the
fireman
hand
us
the
picture
as
for
me
i
turn
away
and
i
lose
command
of
the
english
language
boys
trusted
me
says
schneider
i
remembered
just
in
time
i
remembered
your
picture
i
may
not
be
an
artist
but
i
do
let
a
masterpiece
burn
up
not
in
my
saloon
so
i
save
it
it
is
the
only
thing
i
save
out
of
the
whole
saloon
and
he
wrings
broun
hand
and
i
say
that
night
all
night
long
i
played
beethoven
the
ninth
symphony
is
good
for
feelings
such
as
mine
and
broun
it
is
cooler
in
the
art
institute
and
max
smiling
in
memory
of
other
days
looks
at
the
broun
exhibition
i
could
finish
the
story
by
telling
you
excitedly
that
this
landscape
here
is
the
picture
schneider
saved
he
went
on
pointing
to
one
of
the
large
canvases
but
no
it
would
be
the
truth
i
have
the
picture
home
it
is
not
yet
worth
but
in
a
few
years
more
who
knows
maybe
i
have
cause
to
thank
schneider
yet
satraps
at

the
danseuse

it
over

sounds
like
a
harmonica
but
that
does
matter
not

devilishly
proud
of

looked
when
he
was
writing
music
mumba
jumba
had
a
dream
that
looked
like
this
one
night
when
the
jungle
moon
arched
its
back
and
spat
at
his
black
linen
face
all
right
three

now
the
master
of
ceremonies
is
a
fat
man
with
little
ineffectual
hands

a
voice
that
bows
and
genuflects
and
throws
itself
politely
worshipful
at

singing
see
who
can
hit
her
so
we
throw
her
pennies
and
nickels
and
dimes
they
land
on
her
head
and
one
takes
her
on
the
nose
and
her
voice
dies
away
like
a
baby
bird
falling
out
of
a
nest
and
she
stands
still
jerking
her
mouth
and
the
pennies
falling
all
around
her
and
a
youth
bounces
out
and
picks
them
up
bravo
she
tried
to
bow
and
slipped
another
round
of
applause
for
that
all
right
take
her
away
what
did
she
sing
what
was
the
song
that
mumbled
itself
through
the
laughter
and
the
rain
of
pennies
ladies
and
gentlemen
sghsgbrszsg
will
endeavor
to
entertain
you
with
a
ballad
for
your
amusement
that
fine
after
three
outside
cold
and
dark
but
nothing
cold
or
dark
about
us
we
just
getting
started
bring
out
bring
out
the
ballad
singer
ah
there
a
lad
for
you
his
shoes
all
shined
and
a
clean
collar
on
and
his
face
carefully
shaved
at
home
but
his
hands
would
wash
clean
the
shop
grime
lingers
on
his
hands
and
in
his
broken
nails
but
his
eyes
are
blue
and
he
going
to
sing
the
boys
at
the
shop
know
his
songs
the
noon
hour
knows
them
but
his
voice
sounds
different
here
under
the
beating
tungstens
it
quavers
something
about
ireland
a
little
bit
of
heaven
he
ca
sing
if
he
was
in
his
shirt
sleeves
and
the
collar
was
off
and
his
face
hurt
from
the
dull
safety
razor
blade
it
would
sound
better
but
pennies
for
him
hit
the
singing
boy
in
the
eye
and
win
the
cazaza
a
little
bit
of
heaven
called
ireland
is
what
he
singing
and
the
noises
start
the
pennies
and
nickels
rain
finis
not
so
good
he
sang
it
all
the
way
through
and
his
voice
grew
better
and
better
take
him
away
we
did
like
the
way
his
eyes
blazed
back
at
us
when
the
pennies
fell
not
so
good
not
so
good
here
she
is
little
bertha
the
sewing
machine
girl
in
the
flesh
and
walking
across
the
slippery
dance
floor
with
her
french
heeled
patent
leathers
wiggling
under
her
bertha
the
doodles
this
is
the
way
she
stood
at
the
piano
at
sadie
party
this
is
the
way
she
smiled
at
the
errand
boys
and
counter
jumpers
at
sadie
party
this
is
the
way
she
bowed
and
this
is
the
song
she
sang
to
them
that
they
applauded
so
much
and
this
is
too
good
to
be
true
bravo
six
times
dimes
and
quarters
and
a
majestic
half
dollar
that
takes
bertha
on
the
ear
bravo
eleven
times
bertha
stands
smirking
and
moving
her
shoulders
and
singing
in
a
piping
little
voice
encore
encore
and
it
goes
to
bertha
head
the
applause
and
laughter
the
lights
and
the
pounding
of
the
pennies
falling
out
of
heaven
around
her
feet
these
are
too
much
for
bertha
she
ends
her
arms
make
a
gesture
a
weak
little
gesture
as
if
she
were
embracing
one
of
the
errand
boys
in
a
vestibule
saying
a
vague
radiance
comes
over
bertha
face
bravo
times
the
grand
prize
of
fifty
bones
is
hers
wait
and
see
if
it
ai
more
lions
and
more
christians
bring
out
the
boy
with
the
harmonica
he
forgets
the
tune
all
the
time
and
we
laugh
and
hit
him
with
pennies
the
clerk
with
the
shock
of
black
hair
who
does
an
apache
dance
and
does
it
well
too
well
and
the
female
impersonator
who
does
a
female
dance
very
well
much
too
well
nobody
wants
them
we
want
bertha
the
sewing
machine
girl
there
was
a
thrill
to
her
the
way
she
looked
when
the
applause
grew
loud
the
way
her
girl
arms
reached
out
toward
something
as
if
we
at
the
tables
rolling
around
in
our
seats
and
laughing
our
heads
off
and
all
dressed
up
and
guzzling
sandwiches
and
ginger
ale
as
if
we
were
something
at
a
rainbow
end
bring
her
on
again
line
up
now
we
applaud
the
one
we
liked
the
best
for
his
nobs
who
gargled
the
irish
ballad
two
bravos
if
he
got
mad
at
us
or
if
he
got
madder
and
spat
a
little
more
behind
the
music
that
came
from
him
but
he
did
the
first
gal
who
died
on
the
floor
whose
heart
collapsed
whose
eyes
went
blank
with
terror
nine
bravos
for
her
there
was
a
thrill
to
her
bravos
for
the
rest
of
them
too
but
bertha
wins
the
cazaza
fifty
bucks
for
bertha
here
you
are
bertha
you
win
look
she
crying
that
all
right
girl
that
all
right
cry
we
just
gave
you
the
prize
because
you
gave
us
a
thrill
that
fair
enough
because
of
all
the
geniuses
who
performed
for
our
amusement
and
whom
we
bombarded
with
pennies
you
were
the
only
one
who
threw
out
your
arms
and
your
eyes
to
us
as
if
we
were
rainbow
end
sardotopolis
evening
off
sardotopolis
hurried
along
without
looking
into
the
store
window
she
was
carrying
her
baby
home
from
the
doctor
office
the
doctor
said
hurry
on
get
him
home
and
do
buy
him
any
ice
cream
on
the
way
sardotopolis
lived
in
a
place
above
a
candy
book
and
notion
store
at
south
halsted
street
it
was
late
afternoon
greeks
jews
russians
italians
czechs
were
busy
in
the
street
they
sat
outside
their
stores
in
old
chairs
hovered
protectingly
over
the
outdoor
counters
walked
lazily
in
search
of
iced
drinks
or
stood
with
their
noses
close
together
arguing
the
store
windows
glittered
with
crude
colors
and
careless
clothes
it
was
at
such
times
as
this
hurrying
home
from
a
office
or
a
grocery
store
that
sardotopolis
enjoyed
herself
her
little
eyes
would
take
in
the
gleaming
arrays
of
tin
pans
calico
remnants
picture
books
hair
combs
and
things
like
that
with
which
the
merchants
of
halsted
street
fill
their
windows
but
this
time
sardotopolis
had
seven
blocks
to
go
to
her
home
and
there
was
no
time
for
looking
at
things
despite
the
heat
she
had
carefully
wrapped
the
baby
in
her
arms
in
a
shawl
when
sardotopolis
got
home
there
would
be
eight
other
children
to
take
care
of
but
that
was
a
simple
matter
none
of
them
was
sick
when
the
eight
children
were
sick
they
tumbled
shrieked
and
squealed
in
the
dark
hallway
or
in
the
street
anywhere
sardotopolis
only
listened
with
half
an
ear
as
long
as
they
made
noise
they
were
healthy
so
from
day
to
day
she
listened
not
for
their
noise
but
to
hear
if
any
of
them
grew
quiet
joe
had
grown
quiet
joe
was
the
baby
a
year
and
a
half
and
quite
a
citizen
after
several
days
sardotopolis
could
stand
joe
quiet
any
more
his
skin
too
made
her
feel
sad
his
skin
was
hot
and
dry
so
she
had
hurried
off
to
the
doctor
there
was
hardly
time
in
her
day
for
such
an
errand
now
she
must
get
home
quickly
sardotopolis
and
his
three
brothers
would
be
home
before
it
got
dark
in
the
kitchen
in
the
big
pot
she
had
left
three
chickens
cooking
a
gypsy
leaned
out
of
a
doorway
she
was
dressed
in
many
red
blue
and
yellow
petticoats
and
waists
beads
hung
from
her
neck
and
her
withered
arms
were
alive
with
copper
bracelets
tell
your
fortune
missus
she
called
sardotopolis
hurried
by
with
no
more
than
a
look
some
day
she
would
let
the
gypsy
tell
her
fortune
it
cost
only
cents
but
now
there
was
no
time
too
much
to
do
her
arms
heavy
tireless
arms
that
knew
how
to
work
for
fifteen
hours
each
day
clung
to
the
bundle
joe
made
in
his
shawl
but
the
doctor
was
a
fool
what
harm
could
ice
cream
do
when
anybody
was
sick
ice
cream
could
make
them
well
so
sardotopolis
lifted
joe
up
and
turned
her
eyes
toward
an
ice
cream
stand
she
stopped
if
joe
said
wan
na
she
would
buy
him
some
but
joe
did
seem
to
know
what
she
was
offering
although
usually
he
was
quite
a
citizen
so
she
said
aloud
wan
na
ice
cream
joe
to
this
joe
made
no
answer
except
to
let
his
head
fall
back
sardotopolis
grew
frightened
and
walked
fast
as
she
came
near
her
home
sardotopolis
was
leaning
over
the
bundle
in
her
arms
crying
joe
joe
do
you
hear
joe
the
streets
swarmed
with
the
early
evening
crowds
of
men
and
women
going
home
in
the
cars
the
people
stood
packed
as
if
they
were
sardines
a
few
feet
from
her
door
beside
the
candy
and
notion
store
sardotopolis
stopped
her
heavy
face
had
grown
white
she
raised
the
bundle
closer
to
her
eyes
and
looked
at
it
joe
she
repeated
what
a
matter
joe
the
bundle
was
silent
so
sardotopolis
pinched
it
then
she
stared
at
the
closed
eyes
then
she
seized
the
bundle
and
crushed
it
desperately
in
her
heavy
arms
against
her
heavy
bosom
joe
she
repeated
what
a
matter
joe
the
glazier
sitting
in
front
of
his
glassware
store
stood
up
and
blinked
whatsamatter
he
asked
sardotopolis
did
answer
but
stood
in
front
of
her
house
holding
the
bundle
in
her
arms
and
repeating
its
name
a
small
crowd
gathered
she
addressed
herself
to
several
women
of
her
race
i
knew
before
it
come
she
said
he
did
want
no
ice
cream
sardotopolis
walked
upstairs
and
laid
the
bundle
down
on
the
table
it
lay
without
moving
and
sardotopolis
stood
over
it
without
moving
then
she
sat
down
in
a
chair
beside
it
and
began
to
cry
when
sardotopolis
and
his
three
brothers
came
home
from
driving
the
wagon
they
found
her
still
crying
joe
is
dead
she
said
the
other
children
were
all
properly
noisy
sardotopolis
said
i
will
call
my
sisters
and
mother
he
went
over
looked
at
the
child
that
lay
dead
on
the
table
and
stroked
its
head
the
sisters
and
mothers
arrived
they
took
charge
of
the
big
pot
with
the
three
chickens
in
it
of
the
eight
squalling
little
ones
and
of
the
silent
bundle
on
the
table
there
were
four
sisters
as
it
grew
dark
sardotopolis
found
that
she
was
sitting
alone
in
a
corner
of
the
room
she
felt
tired
there
was
no
use
hugging
the
baby
any
more
joe
was
dead
in
a
few
days
he
would
be
buried
tears
yes
particularly
since
in
a
few
months
he
would
have
had
a
smaller
brother
now
sardotopolis
was
frightened
joe
was
the
first
to
die
she
walked
out
of
the
house
down
the
dark
hallway
into
the
street
it
will
do
her
good
said
her
who
watched
her
in
the
street
there
was
nothing
to
do
there
were
no
errands
to
make
she
could
just
walk
people
were
just
walking
young
people
arm
in
arm
it
was
a
summer
night
in
halsted
street
sardotopolis
walked
until
her
eyes
grew
clearer
she
took
a
deep
breath
and
looked
about
her
nervously
there
was
a
gypsy
leaning
out
of
the
doorway
sardotopolis
stared
at
her
tell
your
fortune
missus
called
the
gypsy
sardotopolis
nodded
and
entered
the
hallway
her
head
felt
dizzy
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
until
tomorrow
when
they
buried
joe
with
a
curious
thrill
under
her
heavy
bosom
sardotopolis
held
out
her
palm
to
the
gypsy
the
great
traveler
alexander
ginkel
has
been
around
the
world
a
week
ago
he
came
to
chicago
and
after
looking
around
for
a
few
days
located
in
one
of
the
less
expensive
hotels
and
started
to
work
as
a
porter
in
a
department
store
downtown
a
friend
said
there
a
man
living
in
my
hotel
who
should
make
a
good
story
he
been
around
the
world
worked
in
england
bulgaria
russia
siberia
china
and
everywhere
was
cook
on
a
tramp
steamer
in
the
south
seas
a
remarkable
fellow
really
in
this
way
i
came
to
call
on
ginkel
i
found
him
after
work
in
his
room
he
was
a
short
man
over
and
looked
uninteresting
i
told
him
that
we
should
be
able
to
get
some
sort
of
story
out
of
his
travels
and
experiences
he
nodded
yes
he
said
i
been
all
around
the
world
then
he
became
silent
and
looked
at
me
hopefully
i
explained
people
like
to
read
about
travelers
they
sit
at
home
themselves
and
wonder
what
it
would
be
like
to
travel
you
probably
had
a
lot
of
experiences
that
would
give
people
a
vicarious
thrill
i
understand
you
were
a
cook
on
a
tramp
steamer
in
the
south
seas
oh
yes
said
ginkel
i
been
all
over
i
been
around
the
world
we
lighted
pipes
and
ginkel
removed
a
book
from
a
drawer
in
the
dresser
he
opened
it
and
i
saw
it
was
a
book
of
photographs
mostly
pictures
taken
with
a
small
camera
here
are
some
things
you
could
use
he
said
you
wan
na
look
at
them
we
went
through
the
pictures
together
this
one
here
said
ginkel
is
me
in
vladivostok
it
was
taken
on
the
corner
there
the
photograph
showed
ginkel
dressed
just
as
he
was
in
the
hotel
room
standing
near
a
lamp
post
on
a
street
corner
there
was
visible
a
part
of
a
store
window
this
one
is
interesting
said
ginkel
warming
up
it
was
taken
in
the
archipelago
you
know
where
i
forget
the
name
of
the
town
but
it
was
in
the
south
seas
we
both
studied
it
for
a
space
it
showed
ginkel
standing
underneath
something
that
looked
like
a
palm
tree
but
the
tree
was
slightly
out
of
focus
so
were
ginkel
feet
it
is
interesting
said
ginkel
but
it
ai
such
a
good
picture
the
lower
part
is
kind
of
blurred
you
notice
we
looked
through
the
album
in
silence
for
a
while
then
ginkel
suddenly
remembered
something
oh
i
almost
forgot
he
said
there
one
i
think
you
like
it
was
taken
in
calcutta
you
know
where
here
it
is
he
pointed
proudly
toward
the
end
of
the
book
we
studied
it
through
the
tobacco
smoke
it
was
a
photograph
of
ginkel
dressed
in
the
same
clothes
as
before
and
standing
under
a
store
awning
there
was
a
good
light
on
this
said
ginkel
and
you
see
how
plain
it
comes
out
then
we
continued
without
comment
to
study
other
photographs
there
were
at
least
several
hundred
they
were
all
of
ginkel
most
of
them
were
blurred
and
showed
odds
and
ends
of
backgrounds
out
of
focus
such
as
trees
street
cars
buildings
telephone
poles
there
was
one
that
finally
aroused
ginkel
to
comment
this
would
have
been
a
good
one
but
it
got
light
struck
he
said
it
was
taken
in
bagdad
when
we
had
exhausted
the
album
ginkel
felt
more
at
ease
he
offered
me
some
tobacco
from
his
pouch
i
resumed
the
original
line
of
questioning
did
you
have
any
unusual
adventures
during
your
travels
or
did
you
get
any
ideas
that
we
could
fix
up
for
a
story
i
asked
well
said
ginkel
i
was
always
a
camera
bug
you
know
i
guess
what
gave
me
the
bug
for
travelling
to
take
pictures
you
know
i
got
a
lot
more
than
these
but
i
ai
mounted
them
yet
are
they
like
the
ones
in
the
book
not
quite
so
good
most
of
them
ginkel
answered
they
were
taken
when
i
had
had
much
experience
you
must
have
been
in
russia
while
the
revolution
was
going
on
you
oh
yes
i
got
one
there
he
opened
the
book
again
here
he
said
this
was
in
moscow
i
was
in
moscow
when
this
was
taken
it
was
another
picture
of
ginkel
slightly
out
of
focus
and
standing
against
a
store
front
i
asked
him
suddenly
who
had
taken
all
the
pictures
oh
that
was
easy
he
said
i
can
always
find
somebody
to
do
that
i
take
a
picture
of
them
first
and
then
they
take
one
of
me
i
always
give
them
the
one
i
take
of
them
and
keep
the
one
they
take
of
me
did
you
see
any
of
the
revolution
ginkel
a
lot
of
monkey
business
said
ginkel
i
seen
some
of
it
not
much
the
last
thing
i
said
was
you
must
have
come
in
for
a
lot
of
sights
we
might
fix
up
a
story
about
that
if
you
could
give
me
a
line
on
them
and
the
last
thing
ginkel
said
was
oh
yes
i
been
around
the
world
thumbs
up
and
down
later
the
art
jury
will
sit
on
them
the
art
jury
will
discuss
tone
and
modelling
rhythm
and
chiaroscuro
and
perspective
and
in
the
light
of
these
discussions
and
decisions
the
art
jury
will
sort
out
the
masterpieces
that
are
to
be
hung
in
the
chicago
artists
exhibition
and
the
masterpieces
that
are
not
to
be
hung
right
now
however
louis
and
mike
are
unwrapping
them
every
day
between
nine
and
five
louis
and
mike
assemble
in
the
basement
of
the
art
institute
the
masterpieces
arrive
by
the
bushel
the
truckload
the
basketful
louis
unwraps
them
mike
stacks
them
up
louis
then
calls
off
their
names
and
the
names
of
geniuses
responsible
for
them
mike
writes
this
vital
information
down
in
a
book
art
is
a
contagious
business
perfectly
normal
and
marvelously
people
are
as
likely
to
succumb
to
it
as
anybody
else
it
is
significant
that
the
purity
league
meeting
in
the
city
a
few
weeks
ago
discussed
the
dangers
which
lay
in
exposing
even
decent
people
to
art
any
kind
of
art
the
insidious
influence
of
art
can
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
be
exaggerated
i
personally
know
of
a
number
of
very
fine
and
highly
respected
citizens
who
have
been
lured
away
from
their
very
business
by
art
however
this
is
no
place
to
sound
the
alarm
i
will
some
day
talk
on
the
subject
before
the
rotary
club
to
return
to
louis
and
mike
after
mike
writes
the
vital
information
down
in
a
book
louis
carts
the
canvas
over
to
a
truck
and
it
is
ready
for
the
jury
room
when
they
started
on
the
job
louis
and
mike
were
frankly
indifferent
they
might
just
as
well
have
been
unwrapping
herring
cases
and
they
were
exceedingly
efficient
they
unwrapped
them
and
catalogued
them
as
fast
as
they
came
in
three
days
however
the
workmanlike
morale
with
which
louis
and
mike
started
on
the
job
has
been
undermined
they
have
grown
more
leisurely
they
no
longer
bundle
the
pictures
around
like
herring
cases
instead
they
look
at
them
try
them
this
way
and
that
way
until
they
find
out
which
way
is
right
side
up
then
they
pass
judgment
louis
unwraps
them
i
was
standing
by
in
the
basement
with
bert
elliott
who
has
submitted
a
modernistic
picture
of
michigan
avenue
the
wrigley
building
and
the
sky
called
up
straight
and
across
home
of
the
muskrat
louis
called
mike
wrote
it
down
wan
na
look
at
it
mike
yeah
let
see
time
out
for
critical
inspection
say
this
guy
never
saw
a
muskrat
house
that
ai
the
way
of
dreams
called
louis
hm
you
ca
tell
which
is
right
side
up

goes
like
this

a
swell
idee

a
fog

probably
a
different
sea
can
you
imagine
anybody
sending
a
thing
like
that
in
it
ai
hardly
worth
the
work
of
unwrapping
it
hurry

there
louis
if
he
means
the
birds
why
do
he
say
birds
instead
of
children
why
do
he
say
of

argue
with
me

violin
pupil
you
can
tell

silence

for
several
minutes
staring
at
something
hurry

called
mike
it
getting
late
this
is
a
mistake
called
louis
here
one
that
a
mistake
how
come
louis

see
for
yourself
the
guy

a
mistake

does
it
read
on
the
back
hurry
we
ca
waste
no
more
time
it
reads
down
and
across
or
something
it
a
mistake
though
louis
remained
eyeing
the
canvas
raptly
it
ai
finished
mike
we
ought
to
send
it
back
let
see
louis
time
out
for
critical
inspection
you
right
it
is
a
mistake
down
and
across
you
said
well
we
let
it
ride
not
our
fault
what
the
name
of
the
guy
bert
elliott
called
louis
a
laugh
followed
louis
turned
to
me
and
my
friend
you
see
this
he
said
i
get
it
now
that
the
wrigley
building
over
there
what
do
you
know
about
that
louis
seized
his
sides
and
doubled
up
elliott
beside
me
cleared
his
throat
and
glanced
apprehensively
at
his
canvas
i
say
it
the
first
one
he
laughed
at
said
elliott
pensively
he
did
laugh
at
any
of
the
others
look
he
still
looking
at
it
that
longer
than
he
looked
at
any
of
the
others
all
right
louis
from
mike
come
on
ho
ho
louis
went
on
i
like
to
see
this
guy
elliott
anybody
who
would
draw
a
picture
like
that
hold
your
horses
mike
here
another
faun
what
a
faun
mike
i
guess
he
means
fern
it
looks
like
a
fern
it
does
that
louis
but
we
have
to
let
it
go
as
a
faun
it
probably
a
foreign
word
most
of
these
artists
are
foreigners
anyway
elliott
and
i
left
elliott
remarking
on
the
way
down
the
institute
steps
ho
hum
ornaments
ornaments
change
and
perhaps
not
for
the
best
the
scherzo
architecture
of
villon
paris
the
gabled
caprice
of
shakespeare
london
the
rip
van
winkle
jauntiness
of
a
vanished
new
york
these
are
ghosts
that
wander
among
the
skyscrapers
and
dynamo
beltings
of
modernity
one
by
one
the
charming
blunders
of
the
past
have
been
set
to
rights
highways
are
no
longer
the
casual
folderols
of
adventure
but
the
reposeful
and
efficient
arteries
of
traffic
the
roofs
of
the
town
are
no
longer
a
rumble
of
idiotic
hats
cocked
at
a
angle
windows
no
longer
wink
lopsidedly
at
one
another
doorways
and
chimneys
railings
and
lanterns
have
changed
cobblestones
and
dirt
have
vanished
at
least
officially
towns
once
were
like
improvised
little
melodramas
men
once
wore
their
backgrounds
as
they
wore
their
clothes
to
fit
their
moods
a
cap
and
feather
a
gable
and
a
latticed
window
for
romance
a
glove
and
rapier
a
turret
and
a
postern
gate
for
adventure
and
for
our
immemorial
friend
routine
a
jumble
of
alleys
feather
pens
cobblestones
echoing
stairways
and
bouncing
milk
carts
these
things
have
all
been
properly
corrected
today
the
city
frowns
from
one
end
to
the
other
like
a
highly
efficient
and
insanely
practical
platitude
mood
has
given
way
to
mode
an
essential
evolution
alas
wore
his
paris
as
a
cloak
and
perhaps
insull
wears
his
chicago
as
a
shirt
front
but
most
of
us
have
parted
company
with
the
town
it
is
a
background
designed
and
marvelously
executed
for
our
conveniences
the
great
metronomes
of
the
loop
with
their
million
windows
the
deft
crisscross
of
streets
the
utilitarian
miracles
of
plumbing
doorways
heating
systems
and
passenger
carriers
these
are
monuments
to
our
collective
sanity
but
if
one
is
insane
if
one
has
inherited
one
characteristics
as
idler
loafer
lounger
dreamer
lover
or
picaroon
what
then
eh
one
stays
at
home
and
tells
it
to
the
typewriter
or
more
likely
one
gets
run
down
chewed
up
and
bespattered
while
darting
across
state
street
in
quest
of
an
invigorating
vanilla
phosphate
nevertheless
there
a
word
that
speaks
innate
optimism
nevertheless
there
are
things
which
do
not
change
as
logically
as
do
ornaments
men
and
women
for
instance
and
although
the
town
wears
its
mask
of
deplorable
sanity
and
though
sunnyside
avenue
seems
suavely
reminiscent
of
von
bissing
troops
through
belgium
there
are
men
and
women
one
naturally
inquires
where
quite
so
where
are
there
men
and
women
in
the
city
one
sees
crowds
but
men
and
women
are
lost
one
observes
crowds
answering
the
advertisements
the
advertisements
say
come
here
go
there
and
one
sees
men
and
women
devotedly
bent
upon
rewarding
the
advertisers
again
nevertheless
there
are
other
observations
to
make
there
are
the
taxicabs
here
in
the
taxicabs
one
may
still
observe
men
and
women
villon
paris
shakespeare
london
and
vanished
new
york
these
are
crowded
into
the
taxicabs
in
the
taxicabs
men
and
women
still
wear
the
furtive
illogical
questing
mysterious
wasterel
adventure
masks
of
their
grandfathers
yesterdays
what
ho
a
devilishly
involved
argument
that
when
the
taxicab
owners
plume
themselves
upon
being
the
last
word
in
the
matter
of
deplorable
efficiency
the
ultimate
gasp
in
the
business
of
convenience
nevertheless
although
hertz
points
with
proper
scorn
to
the
sedan
chair
the
palanquin
the
ox
cart
and
the
ringling
brothers
racing
chariots
we
sweep
a
fedora
across
the
ground
raise
our
eyebrows
and
smile
mysteriously
to
ourselves
for
on
the
days
when
our
insanities
grow
somewhat
persistent
there
is
a
solace
in
the
spectacle
of
taxicabs
that
none
of
the
advertisements
of
hertz
or
his
contemporaries
can
take
away
for
odds
bodkins
gaze
you
through
the
little
windows
of
these
taxicabs
pretty
gals
leaning
forward
lips
parted
with
an
air
of
piquing
rendezvous
to
the
parasols
clutched
in
their
dainty
hands
plump
dandies
reclining
like
tailored
paladins
in
the
leather
cushions
youths
surrounded
with
heaps
of
bags
and
cases
on
a
carefully
linened
quest
nervous
old
women
mysteriously
ragged
creatures
rakish
silk
hats
bundles
of
children
with
staring
fingers
strangely
mustachioed
and
gentry
a
goodly
company
a
teasing
procession
for
the
eye
and
the
thought
the
cabs
shoot
by
caracoling
through
the
orderly
lines
of
traffic
zigzags
of
yellow
green
blue
lavender
black
and
white
snorting
along
with
a
fine
disdain
they
speak
of
destinations
reminiscent
of
the
postern
gate
and
the
latticed
window
of
the
waiting
barque
and
the
glowing
tavern
of
the
crowds
on
the
pavements
of
the
crowds
in
the
passenger
cars
elevators
lobbies
one
wonders
little
where
they
are
going
answering
advertisements
forsooth
vertebrate
brothers
of
the
codfish
but
these
others
ah
one
stands
on
the
curb
with
the
vanilla
phosphate
playing
havoc
with
one
blood
and
wonders
a
hatful
these
sybarites
of
the
taxis
are
going
somewhere
make
no
doubt
of
that
these
insanely
assorted
creatures
bouncing
on
the
leather
cushions
are
launched
upon
mysterious
and
important
enterprises
and
these
jehus
black
eyed
hard
mouthed
a
fetching
tribe
a
cross
between
acroceraunian
bandits
and
samaritans
one
may
stare
at
a
taxi
scooting
by
and
think
with
no
incongruity
of
carlyle
night
of
spurs
with
louis
and
his
harried
antoinette
flying
the
guillotine
and
of
other
things
which
our
inefficient
memory
prevents
us
from
jotting
down
at
this
moment
but
of
other
things
journalism
is
incomplete
without
its
moral
or
at
least
its
overtones
of
morals
and
we
come
to
that
now
as
an
honest
reporter
should
our
moral
is
very
simple
any
good
platitudinarian
will
already
have
forestalled
it
it
is
that
the
goodly
company
riding
about
in
these
taxicabs
upon
which
we
have
been
speculating
are
none
other
than
these
codfish
of
the
pavements
the
same
messieurs
a
fact
which
gives
us
hope
briefly
hope
for
the
fact
that
the
world
is
not
as
sane
as
it
looks
and
that
despite
all
the
fine
strivings
of
construction
engineers
plumbers
advertisers
and
the
like
men
and
women
still
preserve
the
quaint
spirit
of
disorder
and
melodrama
which
once
lived
in
the
ornaments
of
the
town
the
watch
fixer
the
wooden
counter
in
front
of
gustave
is
littered
with
tiny
pieces
of
spring
tiny
keys
almost
invisible
screws
and
tools
gustave
himself
is
a
large
man
with
ponderous
eyebrows
and
a
thick
nose
he
stands
behind
his
counter
in
the
north
wells
street
repair
shop
looking
much
too
large
for
the
store
itself
and
grotesquely
out
of
proportion
with
the
springs
keys
screws
and
miniature
tools
before
him
attached
to
gustave
right
eye
is
a
microscope
it
is
fastened
on
by
aid
of
straps
round
his
large
head
when
he
works
he
moves
the
instrument
over
his
eye
and
when
he
rests
he
raises
it
so
that
it
sticks
out
of
his
eyebrow
gustave
is
a
watchmaker
when
he
was
young
he
made
watches
of
curious
design
but
for
years
he
has
had
to
content
himself
with
repairing
watches
incased
in
his
leather
apron
that
hangs
from
his
shoulders
the
venerable
and
somewhat
gargantuan
gustave
stands
most
of
the
day
peering
into
the
tiny
mechanisms
of
watches
brought
into
the
old
furniture
shop
gustave
partner
is
responsible
for
the
furniture
end
of
the
business
as
gustave
grows
older
he
seems
to
lose
interest
in
things
that
do
not
pertain
to
the
delicate
intricacies
of
watches
i
had
a
watch
that
was
being
fixed
gustave
said
it
would
be
ready
in
a
he
slipped
the
microscope
over
his
eye
and
bending
in
his
heavy
way
above
the
small
watch
began
to
pry
with
his
thick
fingers
a
pair
of
tiny
pincers
a
screwdriver
and
a
set
of
things
that
looked
like
dolls
tools
occupied
him
we
talked
gustave
answering
and
evading
questions
and
offering
comments
as
he
worked
not

gustave
shifted
the
microscope
up
over
his
eyebrow
and
smiled
ponderously
across
the
counter
put
it
on
he
said
but
be
careful
dat
how
vatches
iss
busted
alvays
by
bumping
und
paying
no
attention
to
dem
schopenhauer
son
life
alas
is
an
intricate
illusion
god
is
a
pack
of
lies
under
which
man
staggers
to
his
grave
and
man
ah
here
we
have
nature
only
mountebank
here
we
have
nature
humorous
and
ingenuous
experiment
in
tragedy
and
thought
ah
the
chimera
that
seeks
forever
to
devour
life
it
is
the
cult
of
the
pessimist
the
gentle
malice
of
disillusion
and
like
all
other
cults
it
sustains
its
advocates
thus
the
city
has
no
more
citizen
to
offer
than
clarence
darrow
for
years
and
years
darrow
has
been
gently
disproving
the
intelligence
of
man
the
importance
of
life
and
the
necessity
of
thought
for
years
and
years
darrow
has
been
whimsically
deflating
the
illusions
in
which
man
hides
from
the
purposelessness
of
the
cosmos
god
heaven
politics
philosophies
ambition
love
darrow
has
deflated
them
time
and
again
charging
from
to
a
seat
for
the
spectacle
this
is
nothing
against
darrow
that
he
charges
money
sometimes
for
years
and
years
darrow
has
been
enlivening
the
intellectual
purlieus
of
the
city
with
his
debates
and
darrow
debates
have
been
always
worth
and
even
for
various
reasons
it
is
worth
at
least
to
observe
at
first
hand
what
a
cheering
and
invigorating
effect
pessimism
has
had
upon
darrow
after
these
innumerable
years
the
story
concerns
itself
with
a
funeral
darrow
attended
a
few
years
ago
it
is
at
funerals
that
darrow
gentle
malice
finds
itself
crowned
by
circumstances
for
to
this
son
of
schopenhauer
death
is
a
weary
smile
that
is
proof
of
all
his
arguments
this
time
however
darrow
was
curiously
stirred
for
there
lay
dead
in
the
coffin
a
man
for
whom
he
had
held
a
deep
affection
it
was
george
b
foster
the
brilliant
theologian
of
the
university
of
chicago
during
his
life
foster
had
been
a
man
worthy
the
steel
of
darrow
not
that
foster
was
an
unscrupulous
optimist
he
was
merely
an
intellectual
whose
congenital
tendencies
were
idealistic
just
as
darrow
psychic
and
subconscious
tendencies
were
and
apart
from
this
divergence
of
congenital
tendencies
darrow
and
foster
had
a
great
deal
in
common
they
both
loved
argument
they
both
doted
upon
seizing
an
idea
and
energizing
it
with
their
egoism
they
were
in
short
ideal
debaters
whenever
darrow
and
foster
debated
on
one
of
the
major
issues
of
reason
a
flutter
made
itself
felt
in
the
city
even
among
citizens
indifferent
to
debate
indifferent
or
not
one
felt
that
a
debate
between
foster
and
darrow
was
a
matter
of
considerable
importance
things
might
be
disproved
or
proved
on
such
an
occasion
they
were
to
have
debated
on
is
there
immortality
when
death
canceled
the
engagement
this
was
one
of
the
favorite
differences
of
opinion
between
the
two
friends
darrow
of
course
bent
all
his
efforts
on
disproving
immortality
foster
bent
all
his
on
proving
it
considerable
excitement
had
been
stirred
by
the
coming
debate
the
death
of
the
brilliant
theologian
put
an
end
to
it
instead
of
the
debate
there
was
a
funeral
thousands
of
people
who
had
admired
the
intellect
kindness
and
humanitarianism
of
foster
came
to
the
memorial
services
held
in
one
of
the
large
theaters
of
the
loop
darrow
came
his
head
bowed
and
grief
in
his
heart
friends
like
george
foster
never
replace
themselves
death
becomes
not
a
triumphant
argument
an
aloof
clincher
for
pessimism
but
a
robber
there
were
speakers
who
talked
of
the
dead
man
virtues
his
love
for
people
scholarship
and
the
arts
his
keen
brain
and
his
genius
darrow
sat
listening
to
the
eulogy
of
his
dead
friend
and
tears
filled
his
eyes
poor
george
foster
gone
in
a
coffin
to
be
buried
out
of
sight
in
a
few
hours
then
some
one
whispered
to
darrow
that
a
few
words
were
expected
of
him
it
was
darrow
to
his
dear
friend
he
stood
up
and
his
loose
figure
and
slyly
malicious
face
wore
an
unaccustomed
seriousness
the
audience
waited
but
the
facile
darrow
was
having
difficulty
locating
his
voice
his
words
his
eyes
blurred
with
tears
were
still
staring
at
the
coffin
finally
darrow
began
his
dear
friend
dead
so
charming
a
man
so
brilliant
a
mind
dead
now
he
had
been
so
amazingly
alive
it
seemed
incredible
that
he
should
be
dead
it
was
as
if
part
of
himself
darrow
lay
in
the
coffin
the
eulogy
continued
quiet
sincere
stirring
tears
in
the
audience
and
filling
their
hearts
with
a
realization
of
the
grief
that
lay
in
darrow
heart
then
slowly
the
phrases
grew
clearer
we
were
old
friends
and
we
fought
many
battles
of
the
mind
said
darrow
and
we
were
to
have
debated
once
more
next
week
on
there
immortality
it
was
his
contention
whispered
darrow
that
there
is
immortality
he
is
gone
now
but
he
speaks
more
eloquently
on
the
subject
than
if
he
were
still
with
us
there
lies
all
that
remains
of
my
friend
george
burman
foster
in
a
coffin
and
had
he
lived
he
would
have
argued
with
me
on
the
subject
but
he
is
dead
and
he
knows
now
in
the
negation
and
darkness
of
death
that
he
was
wrong
that
there
is
no
immortality
darrow
paused
he
had
after
many
years
won
his
argument
with
foster
but
the
victory
brought
no
elation
darrow
eyes
filled
again
and
he
turned
to
walk
from
the
stage
but
before
he
left
the
mourners
sitting
around
him
heard
him
murmur
i
wish
poor
george
foster
had
been
right
there
would
be
nobody
happier
than
i
to
realize
that
his
soul
had
survived
that
there
was
still
a
george
foster
but
if
he
could
come
back
now
after
the
proof
of
death
he
would
admit
yes
admit
that
that
there
is
no
immortality
and
darrow
with
his
head
bowed
yielded
the
platform
to
his
inarticulate
and
vanquished
friend
and
debater
world
conquerors
the
hall
is
upstairs
a
sign
has
been
tacked
over
the
street
entrance
it
discloses
that
there
is
to
be
a
discussion
this
night
on
the
subject
of
the
world
revolution
the
disclosure
is
made
in
english
yiddish
and
russian
a
thousand
people
have
arrived
they
are
mostly
west
siders
with
a
sprinkling
of
north
and
south
side
residents
there
seem
to
be
two
types
shop
workers
and
a
type
that
classifies
as
the
intelligentsia
the
workers
sit
calmly
and
smoke
the
intelligentsia
are
nervous
women
bearded
men
vivacious
exchanging
greetings
cracking
jokes
the
first
speaker
is
a
very
bad
orator
he
is
a
an
intensity
of
manner
holds
the
audience
in
lieu
of
phrases
he
says
nothing
yet
every
one
listens
he
says
that
workingmen
have
been
slaves
long
enough
that
there
is
injustice
in
the
world
that
the
light
of
freedom
has
appeared
on
the
horizon
this
to
the
audience
is
old
stuff
yet
they
watch
the
talker
he
has
something
they
one
and
all
treasured
in
their
own
hearts
a
faith
in
something
the
workingmen
in
the
audience
have
stopped
smoking
they
listen
with
a
faint
skepticism
in
their
eyes
the
intelligentsia
however
are
warming
up
for
the
moment
old
emotions
are
stirring
in
them
sincerity
in
others
the
martyr
spirit
in
others
is
something
which
thrills
the
insincerity
of
all
intelligentsia
suddenly
there
is
a
change
in
the
hall
our
stuttering
orator
with
the
forceful
manner
has
made
a
few
startling
remarks
he
has
said
and
what
we
must
do
comrades
is
to
use
force
we
can
get
nowhere
without
force
we
must
uproot
overthrow
and
seize
the
government
scandal
a
murmur
races
around
the
hall
the
residents
from
the
north
and
south
sides
who
have
favored
this
discussion
of
world
revolution
with
their
uplifting
presence
are
uneasy
somebody
should
stop
the
man
one
thing
to
be
sincere
and
another
thing
to
be
too
sincere
and
tell
them
that
they
should
use
force
now
what
the
matter
the
orator
has
grown
violent
it
is
somebody
in
the
back
of
the
hall
heads
turn
a
policeman
the
orator
swings
his
arms
and
in
his
foreign
tongue
goes
on
they
are
stopping
us
the
bourgeoisie
they
have
sent
the
polizei
but
we
stand
firm
the
police
are
powerless
against
us
even
though
they
drive
us
from
this
hall
the
orator
is
all
alone
in
his
excitement
the
audience
has
despite
his
valorous
pronouncements
grown
nervous
and
the
policeman
walking
down
the
aisle
seems
embarrassed
he
arrives
at
the
platform
finally
he
hands
a
card
to
the
orator
the
orator
glances
at
the
card
and
then
waves
it
in
the
air
then
he
reads
it
slowly
his
lips
moving
as
he
spells
the
words
out
the
audience
is
shifting
around
acting
as
if
it
wanted
to
rise
and
bolt
for
the
door
ah
exclaims
the
orator
the
policeman
says
that
an
enemy
of
the
revolution
has
smashed
an
automobile
belonging
to
one
of
the
audience
that
was
standing
in
front
of
the
hall
the
number
of
the
automobile
is
as
follows
he
recites
the
number
slowly
and
then
if
anybody
has
an
automobile
by
that
number
standing
downstairs
he
better
go
and
look
after
it
a
substantial
looking
north
sider
arises
and
walks
hurriedly
through
the
hall
the
orator
decides
to
subside
there
is
a
wait
for
the
chief
speaker
who
has
not
yet
arrived
during
the
wait
an
incident
develops
there
are
two
lights
burning
at
the
rear
of
the
stage
a
young
woman
calls
one
of
the
officials
of
the
meeting
look
she
says
those
lights
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
see
the
speaker
who
stands
in
front
of
them
they
shine
in
our
eyes
the
official
wears
a
red
sash
across
the
front
of
his
coat
he
is
one
of
the
minor
leaders
among
the
west
side
soviet
radicals
he
blinks
what
do
you
want
of
me
he
inquires
with
indignation
i
should
go
and
turn
the
lights
out
you
think
i
the
janitor
but
ca
you
just
turn
the
lights
off
persists
the
young
woman
the
janitor
announces
our
official
with
dignity
turns
the
lights
on
and
he
will
turn
them
off
wherewith
the
tarquin
of
the
proletaire
marches
off
two
minutes
later
a
man
in
his
short
sleeves
appears
following
him
this
man
is
the
janitor
the
audience
which
has
observed
this
little
comedy
begins
to
laugh
as
the
janitor
turns
off
the
offending
lights
the
chief
speaker
of
the
evening
has
arrived
he
is
a
good
orator
he
is
also
cynical
of
his
audience
a
short
wiry
man
with
a
pugnacious
face
and
a
cocksure
mustache
he
begins
by
asking
what
they
are
all
afraid
of
he
accuses
them
of
being
more
social
than
revolutionary
as
long
as
revolution
was
the
thing
of
the
hour
they
were
revolutionists
but
now
that
it
is
no
longer
the
thing
of
the
hour
they
have
taken
up
other
hobbies
this
appears
to
be
rather
the
truth
from
the
way
the
intelligentsia
take
it
they
nod
approval
is
one
thing
which
distinguishes
the
intelligentsia
they
are
able
to
recognize
their
faults
their
shortcomings
now
the
speaker
is
on
his
real
subject
revolution
what
we
want
he
cries
is
for
the
same
terrible
misfortune
to
happen
in
this
country
that
happened
in
russia
yes
the
same
marvelous
misfortune
and
he
is
ready
he
is
working
toward
that
end
and
he
wishes
in
all
sincerity
that
the
audience
would
work
with
him
start
a
reign
of
terror
put
the
spirit
of
the
masses
into
the
day
the
unconquerable
will
to
overthrow
the
tyrant
and
govern
themselves
he
continues
an
apostle
of
force
of
fighting
of
shooting
stabbing
and
barricades
that
fly
the
red
flag
he
is
sardonic
and
sarcastic
and
everything
else
and
the
audience
is
disturbed
there
are
whispers
of
scandal
and
half
the
faces
of
the
intelligentsia
frown
in
disapproval
they
came
to
hear
economic
argument
not
a
call
to
arms
the
other
half
is
stirred
it
is
almost
eleven
the
hall
empties
the
streets
are
alive
people
hurry
saunter
stand
laughing
street
cars
store
fronts
mean
houses
shadows
and
a
friendly
moon
these
are
part
of
the
system
three
hours
ago
they
seemed
a
powerful
impregnable
symbol
now
they
can
be
overthrown
the
security
that
pervades
the
street
is
an
illusion
force
can
knock
it
out
a
strange
force
that
lies
in
the
masses
who
live
in
this
street
the
audience
moves
away
the
intelligentsia
will
discuss
the
possibility
of
a
sudden
uprising
of
the
proletaire
and
gradually
they
will
grow
cynical
about
it
and
say
well
he
was
a
good
talker
the
orator
finally
emerges
from
the
building
he
is
surrounded
by
friends
questioners
for
two
blocks
he
has
company
then
he
is
alone
he
stands
waiting
for
a
street
car
some
of
the
audience
pass
by
without
recognizing
him
the
street
car
comes
and
the
orator
gets
on
he
finds
a
seat
his
head
drops
against
the
window
and
his
eyes
close
and
the
car
sweeps
away
taking
with
it
its
load
of
sleepy
men
and
women
who
have
stayed
up
too
late
including
a
messiah
of
the
proletaire
who
dreams
of
leading
the
masses
out
of
bondage
the
man
from
yesterday
you
not
use
my
name
he
said
because
my
family
would
be
exceedingly
grieved
over
the
notoriety
the
thing
would
bring
them
fifty
or
sixty
or
seventy
it
was
hard
to
tell
how
old
he
was
he
looked
like
a
panhandler
and
talked
like
a
scholar
life
had
knocked
him
out
and
walked
over
him
there
was
no
money
in
his
pocket
no
food
in
his
stomach
no
hope
in
his
heart
he
was
asking
for
a
job
some
kind
of
writing
job
his
hands
were
trembling
and
his
face
twitched
despair
underlay
his
words
but
he
kept
it
under
hunger
made
his
body
jerked
and
his
eyes
shine
with
an
unmannerly
eagerness
but
his
words
remained
suave
he
removed
a
pair
of
cracked
and
held
them
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
and
gestured
politely
with
them
hungry
dirty
hopeless
his
linen
gone
his
shoes
torn
something
inside
his
beaten
frame
remained
still
intact
there
was
no
future
but
he
had
a
past
to
live
up
to
he
was
asking
for
a
job
what
kind
of
job
he
did
know
but
he
could
write
he
had
been
around
the
world
he
was
a
cosmopolite
and
a
rhymester
and
a
press
agent
and
a
journalist
he
pulled
himself
together
and
his
eyes
struggled
hard
to
forget
the
hunger
of
his
stomach
in
the
old
days
he
said
enunciating
in
the
oracular
manner
of
a
day
gone
by
ah
i
was
talking
with
jack
london
about
it
before
he
died
dear
jack
a
great
soul
a
marvelous
spirit
we
were
in
the
south
seas
together
yes
the
old
days
were
different
erudition
counted
for
something
i
was
buffalo
bill
first
press
agent
also
i
worked
for
dear
barnum
i
was
his
publicity
man
does
the
world
seem
to
have
changed
to
you
he
asked
i
was
talking
to
george
ade
about
this
very
thing
strange
is
it
george
and
i
are
old
friends
who
dickie
davis
of
the
sun
certainly
a
charming
fellow
stephen
crane
genius
my
friend
genius
was
his
that
was
the
day
when
henry
was
in
new
york
there
was
quite
a
crowd
of
us
we
used
to
foregather
in
some
comfortable
grog
shop
and
discuss
ah
life
and
letters
were
talked
about
a
great
deal
in
those
days
his
voice
had
the
sound
of
a
man
casually
relating
incidents
of
his
past
but
his
eyes
continued
to
shine
eagerly
and
between
sentences
there
were
curious
pauses
the
pauses
asked
something
a
most
curious
thing
occurred
the
other
evening
he
smiled
i
had
to
pay
for
my
oysters
by
writing
a
rhyme
for
the
waiter
an
anecdote
by
a
dilettante
a
gracefully
turned
plea
worthy
of
bruinrmell
you
know
it
grows
more
and
more
difficult
to
obtain
employment
my
wardrobe
is
practically
gone
he
glanced
with
apparent
amusement
at
his
makeup
his
hand
moved
tremblingly
to
his
neck
my
collar
is
soiled
he
murmured
apologizing
with
eyes
that
managed
to
smile
and
the
other
evening
i
lost
my
stick
then
the
hunger
and
the
hopelessness
of
the
man
broke
through
the
shell
of
his
manner
he
needed
a
job
a
job
a
job
something
to
do
to
get
him
food
and
shelter
his
fingers
tried
to
place
the
cracked
back
in
position
i
would
pardon
me
for
mentioning
this
i
would
much
rather
sit
with
a
man
like
you
and
discuss
the
phases
of
life
and
literature
of
interest
to
both
of
us
but
i
would
write
almost
anything
i
have
written
a
great
deal
and
i
have
managed
money
there
was
a
time
a
look
of
pain
came
into
his
eyes
this
was
being
vulgar
and
not
in
line
with
the
tradition
that
his
enunciation
boasted
i
have
known
a
great
many
people
i
do
desire
to
bore
you
with
talk
of
celebrities
and
all
that
but
i
assure
you
i
have
been
somebody
oh
nothing
important
or
perhaps
very
worth
while
i
dislike
this
sort
of
thing
you
know
another
smile
twisted
his
lips
but
when
one
is
down
to
the
last
er
to
the
last
farthing
so
to
speak
one
swallows
a
bit
of
his
pride
that
more
than
an
aphorism
with
me
to
go
on
i
have
handled
great
sums
of
money
i
have
traveled
all
over
the
world
i
have
eaten
and
spoken
with
men
of
genius
all
my
life
my
youth
was
a
very
interesting
one
and
and
perhaps
we
could
go
somewhere
for
dinner
and
and
i
could
tell
you
things
of
writing
men
of
the
past
that
that
might
appeal
to
you
marvelous
fellows
there
was
henry
and
london
and
davis
and
phillips
and
stevie
crane
i
dislike
imposing
myself
on
you
this
way
but
if
i
did
think
you
would
be
interested
in
a
discussion
with
a
man
who
who
admires
the
beautiful
things
of
life
and
who
has
lived
a
rather
varied
existence
i
would
not
the
cracked
were
back
in
place
and
he
had
stopped
short
despair
and
hunger
now
were
talking
out
of
his
eyes
they
had
come
too
close
to
his
words
they
must
never
come
into
his
words
that
would
be
the
one
defeat
that
would
drive
too
deeply
into
him
of
the
past
of
the
easygoing
charmingly
garrulous
past
all
that
was
left
to
this
nomad
of
letters
was
its
manner
he
could
still
sit
in
his
rags
as
if
he
were
lounging
in
the
salon
of
an
ocean
liner
still
gesture
with
his
as
if
he
were
fixing
the
attention
of
a
richard
harding
davis
across
a
bottle
of
chateau
yquem
so
he
remained
silent
let
his
eyes
and
the
twitching
of
his
face
betray
him
his
words
never
would
his
words
would
always
be
the
carefully
modulated
nicely
considerate
words
of
a
gentleman
he
resumed
so
you
have
nothing
ah
that
rather
rather
disturbing
just
a
moment
please
i
do
mean
to
impose
on
you
wo
you
sit
down
so
i
will
feel
more
at
ease
thank
you
sir
perhaps
there
is
something
in
the
way
of
a
of
another
kind
of
job
anything
about
a
theater
a
newspaper
office
a
magazine
a
circus
an
hotel
i
know
them
all
and
if
you
could
only
keep
an
eye
open
for
me
thank
you
sir
i
am
glad
to
see
that
men
of
letters
are
still
considerate
of
their
fellow
craftsmen
ah
you
would
have
liked
jack
london
did
you
know
him
you
know
we
live
in
an
age
of
jazz
yes
sir
the
tempo
is
fast
life
has
lost
its
andante
materialism
has
triumphed
there
is
no
longer
room
for
the
spirit
to
expand
machines
are
in
the
way
noises
invade
the
sanctity
of
meditative
hours
it
was
cold
outside
the
cigar
store
the
man
from
yesterday
stepped
into
the
street
he
stood
smiling
for
a
moment
and
for
the
moment
in
the
courteous
friendliness
of
his
rheumy
eyes
in
the
mannerly
tilt
of
his
head
there
was
the
picture
of
a
sophisticated
gentleman
of
the
world
nodding
an
adieu
outside
his
favorite
chophouse
then
he
turned
the
mannerly
tilt
vanished
there
was
to
be
seen
a
man
fifty
sixty
or
seventy
it
was
hard
to
tell
how
old
shuffling
tiredly
down
the
street
his
body
huddled
together
and
his
shoulders
shivering
thumbnail
lotharios
here
the
low
down
gentlemen
the
miserere
of
the
manicurist
peewee
the
aphrodite
of
the
thousand
nails
has
been
inveigled
into
submitting
her
lipstick
memoirs
to
the
public
eye
peewee
is
the
melting
little
lady
with
the
vermilion
mouth
and
the
cooing
eyes
who
manicures
in
a
rialto
hotel
barber
shop
she
is
the
one
whose
touch
is
like
the
cool
caress
of
a
snowflake
whose
face
is
as
void
of
guile
as
the
face
of
the
blessed
damosel
there
are
others
and
dryads
flo
ziegfeld
has
nothing
on
george
the
head
barber
when
it
comes
to
an
eye
for
color
and
a
sense
for
curve
but
they
are
busy
at
the
moment
the
dons
and
the
romeos
are
giving
the
girls
a
heavy
play
peewee
alone
is
at
leisure
therefore
let
us
gallop
quickly
to
the
memoirs
h
says
peewee
i
tell
you
about
men
of
course
what
i
say

all
men

may
be
exceptions

on
a
derisive
and
ominous
air

she
with
a
sniff
men

all
alike
i
do
care
who
they
are

wives

of
them

of
them

same
play

are
cheaper
than
others
of
course
there
the
hair
i
hand
him
the
medal
for
cheapness
but
i
got
a
lot
of
other
medals
and
i
give
them
all
away
too
well
sir
they
come
in
here
and
you
take
hold
of
their
hand
and
start
in
doing
honest
work
and
blooey
they
off
they
strangers
in
town
and
lonesome
my
god
how
lonesome
they
are
and
they
do
know
no
place
to
go
that
the
way
they
begin
and
they
give
your
hand
a
squeeze
and
roll
a
eye
at
you
say
it
gets
kind
of
tiring
you
can
imagine
particularly
after
been
through
what
i
have
and
know
their
middle
names
which
are
all
alike
they
all
answering
to
the
name
of
cheap
sport
sometimes
i
give
them
the
baby
stare
and
pretend
i
do
know
what
on
their
minds
and
sometimes
when
my
nerves
are
a
little
ragged
i
freeze
them
then
sometimes
i
take
them
up
i
let
them
put
it
over
you
be
surprised
liars
they
all
rich
the
young
ones
are
all
bond
salesmen
with
wealthy
fathers
and
going
to
inherit
soon
the
ones
are
great
manufacturers
the
old
ones
are
retired
financiers
you
should
ought
to
hear
the
lads
when
they
hitting
on
all
six
peewee
wagged
a
wise
old
head
and
her
vermilion
mouth
registered
scorn
at
degrees
fahrenheit
a
very
cold
light
however
kindled
in
her
beautiful
eyes
yes
yes
i
taken
them
up
she
went
on
i
let
them
stake
me
to
the
swell
time
say
ten
dollars
to
one
that
these
manicured
millionaires
do
mean
any
more
than
the
governor
pardon
does
to
carl
wanderer
not
a
bit
i
do
want
to
get
personal
but
take
it
from
me
they
all
after
one
thing
and
they
a
pack
of
selfish
tin
horns
with
fishhook
pockets
the
kind
you
ca
pull
anything
out
of
well
to
get
back
about
the
first
minute
you
get
the
big
squeeze
then
next
the
big
talk
about
being
strangers
in
your
town
then
next
they
open
with
the
big
hearty
invitations
will
you
be
their
little
guide
and
ai
you
the
most
beautiful
thing
they
ever
set
eyes
on
and
say
if
they
only
met
you
before
they
would
be
living
around
hotels
now
lonesome
bachelors
without
a
friend
i
forgot
to
tell
you
all
single
no
never
married
even
some
of
the
most
humpbacked
married
men
you
ever
saw
who
come
in
here
dragging
leg
irons
and
looking
a
picture
of
the
common
people
they
single
too
i
seen
them
slip
wedding
rings
off
their
fingers
to
make
their
racket
stand
up
then
after
they
got
along
and
think
they
got
you
biting
they
begin
to
get
fresh
they
tell
you
you
should
ought
to
work
in
a
barber
shop
a
girl
as
beautiful
as
you
the
surroundings
ai
what
they
should
be
and
they
like
to
fix
you
up
yes
they
begin
handing
out
their
castles
in
rome
or
spain
or
whatever
it
is
cheap
say
they
are
so
cheap
they
would
go
on
the
and
store
counter
sometimes
you
can
shame
them
into
making
good
in
a
small
way
but
too
much
work
oh
yes
they
give
tips
fifty
cents
is
the
usual
tip
sometimes
they
make
it
they
think
they
buying
you
though
for
that
as
i
was
saying
the
hair
boys
are
the
worst
they
the
ones
who
call
themselves
loop
hounds
they
know
everybody
by
their
first
name
and
sometimes
they
got
all
of
in
their
pocket
at
one
time
and
if
you
out
some
evening
with
a
friend
a
regular
fella
they
pop
in
the
next
day
and
say
peewee
who
was
that
street
sweeper
i
see
you
palling
with
last
night
oh
he
was
well
i
had
him
pegged
either
as
a
street
sweeper
or
a
plumber
that
their
speed
and
they
come
again
and
again
they
never
give
up
they
got
visions
of
making
a
conquest
some
day
on
and
when
a
new
girl
comes
into
the
shop
boy
do
the
buzzards
buzz
i
came
here
six
months
ago
and
they
started
it
on
me
but
i
was
born
yesterday
been
a
manicure
in
indianapolis
and
they
just
the
same
in
indianapolis
as
they
are
in
chicago
and
they
just
the
same
in
podunk
now
i
not
going
to
mention
any
names
but
take
your
city
directory
and
begin
with
ab
abner
and
go
right
on
through
to
zeke
zimbo
and
do
skip
any
and
you
get
a
clear
idea
about
the
particular
gentlemen
talking
about
peewee
sighed
and
shook
her
head
are
you
busy
inquired
the
head
manicurist
not
at
all
said
peewee
not
at
all
peewee
biographer
asked
a
final
question
to
which
she
responded
as
follows
well
i
get
married
maybe
when
i
find
the
exception
i
was
telling
you
about
the
gentleman
who
is
a
stranger
in
town
and
in
need
of
a
little
guide
there
must
be
one
of
them
somewhere
unless
they
was
all
killed
in
the
war
the
soul
of
sing
lee
the
years
have
made
a
cartoon
out
of
sing
lee
a
withered
yellow
face
with
motionless
black
eyes
thin
fingers
that
move
with
lifeless
precision
slippered
feet
that
shuffle
as
if
sing
lee
were
yawning
a
smell
of
starch
wet
linen
and
steam
mingles
with
an
aromatic
mustiness
the
day
work
is
done
sing
lee
sits
in
his
chair
behind
the
counter
three
walls
look
down
upon
him
laundry
packages
yellow
paper
white
string
crowd
the
wall
shelves
chinese
letterings
dance
gayly
on
the
yellow
packages
sing
lee
from
behind
the
counter
stares
out
of
the
window
the
hyde
park
police
station
is
across
the
way
people
pass
and
glance
up
sing
lee
hand
laundry
lake
park
avenue
come
in
there
is
something
immaculate
about
sing
lee
sing
lee
has
been
ironing
out
collars
and
shirts
for
years
and
years
have
been
ironing
sing
lee
out
he
is
like
one
of
the
yellow
packages
on
the
shelves
and
there
is
a
certain
lettering
across
his
face
as
indecipherable
and
strange
as
the
dance
of
the
black
hieroglyphs
on
the
yellow
laundry
paper
something
enthralls
sing
lee
it
can
be
seen
plainly
now
as
he
sits
behind
the
counter
it
can
be
seen
too
as
he
works
during
the
day
sing
lee
works
like
a
man
in
an
empty
dream
it
is
the
same
to
sing
lee
whether
he
works
or
sits
still
the
world
of
collars
cuffs
and
shirt
fronts
does
not
contain
sing
lee
it
contains
merely
an
automaton
the
laundry
is
owned
by
an
automaton
named
sing
lee
by
nobody
else
now
that
the
day
work
is
done
he
will
sit
like
this
for
an
hour
two
hours
five
hours
time
is
not
a
matter
of
hours
to
sing
lee
or
of
days
or
even
of
years
the
many
wilted
collars
that
come
under
the
lifeless
hands
of
sing
lee
tell
him
an
old
story
the
story
has
not
varied
for
years
a
solution
of
water
soap
and
starch
makes
the
collars
clean
again
and
stiff
they
go
back
and
they
return
always
wilted
and
soiled
sing
lee
needs
no
further
corroboration
of
the
fact
that
the
crowds
are
at
work
doing
what
soiling
their
linen
that
is
as
final
as
anything
the
crowds
do
sing
lee
curiosity
does
not
venture
beyond
finalities
sing
lee
is
a
resident
of
america
but
this
is
a
formal
statistic
and
refers
only
to
the
automaton
that
owns
the
hand
laundry
in
lake
park
avenue
observe
a
few
more
formal
facts
of
sing
lee
life
he
has
never
been
to
a
movie
or
a
theater
play
he
has
never
ridden
in
an
automobile
he
has
never
looked
at
the
lake
thus
it
becomes
obvious
that
sing
lee
lives
somewhere
else
for
a
man
must
go
somewhere
in
years
or
do
something
there
is
a
story
then
in
sing
lee
not
a
particularly
long
story
life
stories
are
sometimes
no
longer
than
a
single
line
a
sentence
even
a
phrase
so
if
one
could
find
out
where
sing
lee
lives
one
would
have
a
story
perhaps
a
whole
sentence
long
mukee
kai
sing
lee
a
nod
of
the
thin
head
business
good
another
nod
pretty
tired
washing
ironing
all
day
eh
a
nod
when
are
you
going
to
put
in
a
laundry
machine
a
shake
of
the
thin
head
when
are
you
going
to
quit
sing
lee
another
shake
of
the
thin
head
you
not
very
gabby
tonight
sing
a
dignified
answer
to
this
i
thinking
what
about
sing
lee
a
faint
smile
the
smile
seems
to
set
sing
lee
in
motion
it
comes
from
behind
the
automaton
it
is
perhaps
sing
lee
first
gesture
of
life
in
weeks
you
do
mind
my
sitting
here
and
smoking
a
pipe
eh
the
minutes
pass
sing
lee
stands
up
he
turns
on
a
small
electric
light
this
is
a
concession
this
done
he
opens
a
drawer
behind
the
counter
and
removes
a
little
bronze
casket
the
casket
is
placed
on
the
counter
slowly
as
if
in
a
deep
dream
sing
lee
lights
a
match
and
holds
it
inside
the
casket
a
thin
spiral
of
lavender
smoke
unwinds
from
its
mouth
sing
lee
watches
the
spiral
of
smoke
it
wavers
and
unwinds
a
finger
writing
an
idiot
flower
then
it
opens
up
into
a
large
smoke
eye
smoke
eyes
drift
casually
away
an
odor
crawls
into
the
air
sing
lee
eyes
close
gently
and
his
thin
body
moves
as
he
takes
a
deep
breath
his
eyes
still
closed
sing
lee
speaks
you
writer
he
murmurs
yes

into
the
open
drawer
and
takes
out

large
sheet
of
rice
paper
it
is
partly
covered
with
chinese
letters

rodjezke
last
job
rodjezke
scrubbed
the
corridors
of
the
otis
building
after
the
lawyers
stenographers
and
financiers
had
gone
home
during
the
day
rodjezke
found
other
means
of
occupying
her
time
keeping
the
two
rodjezke
children
in
order
keeping
the
flat
near
the
corner
of
and
wallace
streets
in
order
and
hiring
herself
for
cleaning
washing
or
jobs
filled
this
part
of
her
day
as
for
the
rest
of
the
day
no
fault
could
be
found
with
the
manner
in
which
rodjezke
used
that
part
of
her
time
at
she
reported
for
work
in
the
janitor
quarters
of
the
office
building
she
was
given
her
pail
her
scrub
brush
mop
and
bar
of
soap
and
with
eight
other
women
who
looked
curiously
like
herself
started
to
work
in
the
corridors
the
feet
of
the
lawyers
stenographers
and
financiers
had
left
stains
crawling
inch
by
inch
down
the
tiled
flooring
rodjezke
removed
the
stains
one
at
a
time
eight
years
at
this
work
had
taken
away
the
necessity
of
her
wearing
knee
pads
knees
did
not
bother
her
very
much
as
she
scrubbed
in
the
evening
rodjezke
usually
rode
home
in
the
street
car
there
were
several
odd
items
about
rodjezke
that
one
could
observe
as
she
sat
motionless
and
staring
in
her
seat
waiting
for
the
block
to
appear
first
there
were
her
clothes
rodjezke
was
not
of
the
type
of
woman
that
changes
styles
with
the
season
winter
and
summer
she
wore
the
same
then
there
were
her
hands
rodjezke
fingernails
were
a
contrast
to
the
rest
of
her
the
rest
of
her
was
somewhat
vigorous
and
buxom
looking
the
fingernails
however
were
pale
a
colorless
light
blue
and
the
tips
of
her
fingers
looked
a
trifle
swollen
also
the
tips
of
her
fingers
were
different
in
shade
from
the
rest
of
her
hands
another
item
of
note
was
her
coiffure
rodjezke
was
always
indifferently
dressed
her
clothes
looking
as
if
they
had
been
thrown
on
and
pinned
together
yet
her
coiffure
was
almost
a
proud
and
thing
it
proclaimed
alas
that
the
scrubwoman
despite
the
sensible
employment
of
her
time
was
not
entirely
free
from
the
vanities
of
her
sex
the
deliberate
coiling
and
arranging
of
her
stringy
black
hair
must
have
taken
a
good
fifteen
minutes
regularly
out
of
rodjezke
otherwise
industrious
day
these
items
are
given
in
order
that
rodjezke
may
be
visualized
for
a
moment
as
she
rode
home
on
a
recent
evening
it
was
very
hot
and
the
papers
carried
news
on
the
front
page
hot
spell
to
continue
rodjezke
got
off
the
car
at
and
halsted
streets
and
walked
to
her
flat
here
the
two
rodjezke
children
who
were
and
years
old
respectively
were
demanding
their
supper
after
the
food
was
eaten
rodjezke
said
in
bohemian
we
are
going
down
to
the
beach
and
go
in
swimming
shouts
from
the
younger
rodjezkes
when
the
family
appeared
on
the
street
beach
it
was
alive
with
people
from
everywhere
they
stood
around
cooling
off
in
their
bathing
suits
and
trying
to
forget
how
hot
it
was
by
covering
themselves
in
the
chill
sand
rodjezke
bathing
suit
was
of
the
kind
that
attracts
attention
these
days
it
was
voluminous
and
hand
made
and
it
looked
as
if
it
might
have
functioned
as
a
wrapper
in
its
palmier
days
for
a
long
time
nobody
noticed
rodjezke
she
sat
on
the
sand
her
head
felt
dizzy
her
eyes
burned
and
there
was
a
burn
in
the
small
of
her
back
her
knees
also
burned
and
the
tips
of
her
fingers
throbbed
these
symptoms
failed
to
startle
rodjezke
their
absence
would
have
been
more
of
a
surprise
she
sat
staring
at
the
lake
and
trying
to
keep
track
of
her
children
but
their
dark
heads
lost
themselves
in
the
noisy
crowds
in
front
of
her
and
she
gave
that
up
they
would
return
in
due
time
rodjezke
must
not
be
criticized
for
a
maternal
indifference
the
children
of
scrubwomen
always
return
in
due
time
rodjezke
had
come
to
the
lake
to
cool
off
the
idea
of
going
for
a
swim
had
been
in
her
head
for
at
least
three
years
she
had
always
been
able
to
overcome
it
but
this
time
somehow
it
had
got
the
better
of
her
and
she
had
moved
almost
blindly
toward
the
water
front
i
will
get
a
rest
in
the
water
she
thought
but
now
on
the
beach
rodjezke
found
it
difficult
to
rest
the
dishes
were
washed
in
the
kitchen
home
the
clothes
needed
changing
on
the
beds
and
other
things
lots
of
other
things
rodjezke
sighed
as
the
shouts
of
the
bathers
floated
by
her
ears
the
sun
had
almost
gone
down
and
the
lake
looked
dull
faintly
colored
clouds
were
beginning
to
hide
the
water
it
was
no
use
rodjezke
rest
she
sat
and
stared
harder
at
the
lake
yes
there
was
something
to
do
before
it
got
too
dark
something
very
important
to
do
and
it
right
not
to
do
it
the
scrubwoman
sighed
again
and
put
her
hand
against
her
side
the
burn
had
dropped
to
there
it
had
also
gone
into
her
head
but
that
was
a
thing
which
must
be
forgotten
rodjezke
had
learned
how
to
forget
it
during
the
eight
years
a
girl
saw
it
first
she
was
laughing
in
a
group
of
young
men
from
the
hotel
then
she
exclaimed
suddenly
heavens
look
at
that
woman
the
group
looked
they
saw
a
woman
in
a
humorous
bathing
costume
crawling
patiently
down
the
beach
on
her
hands
and
knees
soon
other
people
were
looking
nobody
interfered
at
first
perhaps
this
was
a
curious
exercise
some
of
them
laughed
but
the
woman
actions
grew
stranger
she
would
stop
as
she
crawled
and
lift
up
handfuls
of
water
from
the
edge
of
the
lake
then
she
would
start
scratching
in
the
sand
a
crowd
collected
and
the
beach
policeman
arrived
the
beach
policeman
looked
down
at
the
woman
on
her
hands
and
knees
she
had
stopped
and
her
face
had
grown
sad
what
the
matter
here
the
policeman
asked
of
her
the
woman
began
to
cry
her
tears
flooded
her
round
worn
face
i
ca
finish
it
she
sobbed
not
now
anyway
i
too
tired
i
ca
finish
it
and
the
soap
has
floated
away
the
soap
is
gone
rodjezke
was
taken
up
by
the
policeman
with
the
two
rodjezke
children
who
had
of
course
returned
in
due
time
they
cried
and
cried
and
the
group
went
to
the
police
station
i
do
know
what
wrong
with
the
poor
woman
said
the
beach
policeman
to
the
hyde
park
police
sergeant
but
she
was
moving
up
and
down
like
she
was
trying
to
scrub
the
beach
i
guess
said
the
sergeant
we
have
to
turn
her
over
to
the
psychopathic
hospital
there
a
lot
more
to
the
story
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
rodjezke
last
job
queen
bess
feast
elizabeth
winslow
who
was
a
short
fat
woman
with
an
amazing
gift
of
profanity
and
known
to
the
police
as
queen
bess
is
dead
according
to
the
coroner
report
queen
bess
died
suddenly
in
a
wabash
avenue
rooming
house
at
the
age
of
seventy
years
ago
queen
bess
rented
rooms
and
sold
drinks
according
to
the
ideas
of
that
day
but
there
was
something
untouched
by
the
sordidness
of
her
calling
about
this
ample
rabelaisian
woman
there
was
a
noise
about
queen
bess
lacking
in
her
harpy
contemporaries
bess
the
coppers
used
to
call
her
and
queenie
was
the
name
her
employees
had
for
her
but
to
customers
she
was
always
queen
bess
in
the
district
where
queen
bess
functioned
the
gossip
of
the
day
always
prophesied
dismally
concerning
her
she
did
save
her
money
queen
bess
did
and
the
time
would
come
when
she
realize
what
that
meant
and
the
idea
of
queen
bess
blowing
in
for
a
layout
to
ride
to
the
races
in
six
horses
and
two
drivers
in
yellow
and
blue
livery
and
girls
all
dressed
like
sore
thumbs
and
the
beribboned
and
painted
coach
bouncing
down
the
boulevard
to
washington
park
a
lot
of
good
that
would
do
her
in
her
old
age
but
queen
bess
went
her
way
throwing
her
tainted
money
back
to
the
town
as
fast
as
the
town
threw
it
into
her
purse
roaring
swearing
laughing
a
thumping
sentimentalist
a
clownish
samaritan
a
madam
aphrodite
by
rube
goldberg
there
are
many
stories
that
used
to
go
the
rounds
but
when
i
read
the
coroner
report
there
was
one
tale
in
particular
that
started
up
in
my
head
again
a
mawkish
tale
perhaps
and
if
i
write
it
with
too
maudlin
a
slant
i
know
who
will
wince
the
worst
queen
bess
of
course
who
will
sit
up
in
her
grave
and
fastening
a
blazing
eye
on
me
curse
me
out
for
every
variety
of
and
imbecile
known
to
her
exhaustive
calendar
of
epithets
nevertheless
in
memory
of
the
set
of
oscar
wilde
works
presented
to
my
roommate
twelve
years
ago
one
christmas
morning
by
queen
bess
and
in
memory
of
the
six
oaths
this
great
lady
invented
here
goes
let
bess
roar
in
her
grave
there
one
thing
she
ca
do
and
that
call
me
a
liar
it
was
thanksgiving
day
and
years
ago
and
my
roommate
ned
and
i
were
staring
glumly
over
the
roofs
of
the
town
i
got
an
invitation
for
thanksgiving
dinner
for
both
of
us
said
ned
but
i
feel
kind
of
doubtful
about
going
i
inquired
what
kind
of
invitation
an
engraved
invitation
grinned
ned
here
it
is
i
read
it
to
you
he
read
from
a
white
card
you
are
cordially
invited
to
attend
a
thanksgiving
dinner
at
the
home
of
queen
bess
street
and
wabash
avenue
at
you
may
bring
one
gentleman
friend
why
not
go
i
asked
i
a
new
englander
at
heart
smiled
ned
and
thanksgiving
is
a
sort
of
meaningful
holiday
particularly
when
you
alone
in
the
great
and
wicked
city
i
inquired
of
some
of
the
fellows
about
queen
bess
dinner
it
seems
that
she
gives
one
every
thanksgiving
and
that
they
quite
a
tradition
or
institution
i
ca
find
out
what
sort
they
are
though
i
suspect
some
sort
of
an
orgy
on
the
order
of
the
black
mass
at
we
left
our
room
and
headed
for
the
house
of
queen
bess
a
huge
and
ornamental
chamber
known
as
the
ballroom
or
the
parlor
had
been
converted
into
a
ned
and
i
were
early
six
or
seven
men
had
arrived
they
stood
around
ill
at
ease
looking
at
the
flamboyant
paintings
on
the
wall
as
if
they
were
inspecting
the
titian
room
of
some
museum
ned
who
knew
the
town
pointed
out
two
of
the
six
as
men
of
means
one
was
manager
of
a
store
one
was
a
billiard
champion
in
a
michigan
avenue
club
gradually
the
room
filled
up
a
dozen
more
men
arrived
each
was
admitted
by
invitation
as
we
had
been
sally
the
colored
mammy
of
the
house
took
charge
and
bade
us
be
seated
some
twenty
men
took
their
places
about
the
long
rectangular
table
and
then
a
pianist
entered
i
think
it
was
schultz
he
played
the
piano
in
the
ballrooms
of
the
district
he
came
in
in
a
frock
coat
and
patent
leather
shoes
and
sat
down
at
the
ivories
there
was
a
pause
and
then
the
professor
struck
up
doloroso
pianissimo
the
tune
of
home
sweet
home
as
the
first
notes
carrying
the
almost
audible
words
mid
pleasures
and
palaces
arose
from
the
piano
the
folding
doors
at
the
end
of
the
ballroom
parted
and
there
appeared
queen
bess
followed
by
fifteen
of
the
girls
who
sold
drinks
for
her
queen
bess
was
dressed
in
black
her
white
hair
coiffured
like
a
hospital
superintendent
her
girls
were
dressed
in
simple
afternoon
frocks
neither
rouge
nor
beads
were
to
be
seen
on
them
and
as
the
professor
played
home
sweet
home
queen
bess
marched
her
companions
solemnly
down
the
length
of
the
ballroom
and
seated
them
at
the
table
i
remember
that
before
the
numerous
servitors
started
functioning
queen
bess
made
a
speech
she
stood
up
at
the
head
of
the
table
her
red
face
beaming
under
her
white
hair
and
her
black
eyes
commanding
the
attention
of
the
men
and
women
before
her
all
of
you
know
who
i
am
blankety
blank
said
queen
bess
and
blankety
blank
what
a
reputation
i
got
all
of
you
know
but
i
invited
you
to
this
blankety
blank
dinner
hoping
you
will
humor
me
for
the
afternoon
and
pretend
you
forget
i
would
like
to
see
you
enjoy
yourselves
at
the
banquet
board
eat
and
drink
what
wine
there
is
and
laugh
and
be
thankful
but
without
pulling
any
blankety
blank
rough
stuff
i
would
like
to
see
you
enjoy
yourselves
as
if
you
were
in
in
your
own
homes
which
i
take
it
none
of
you
gentlemen
have
got
seeing
you
are
sitting
here
at
the
board
of
queen
bess
now
gentlemen
she
concluded
if
it
asking
too
much
of
you
to
forget
the
fault
is
mine
and
not
yours
and
nobody
will
be
penalized
or
bawled
out
blankety
blank
him
for
being
unable
to
forget
but
if
you
can
forget
and
if
you
can
let
us
enjoy
ourselves
for
an
afternoon
in
a
blankety
blank
decent
and
way
god
love
you
and
queen
bess
sat
down
we
ate
and
drank
and
laughed
till
seven
that
evening
and
i
remember
that
not
one
of
the
twenty
men
present
used
a
profane
word
during
this
time
not
one
of
them
did
or
said
anything
that
would
have
passed
muster
in
his
own
home
if
he
had
one
and
that
no
one
got
drunk
except
queen
bess
yes
queen
bess
in
her
black
dress
got
very
drunk
and
swore
like
a
trooper
and
laughed
like
a
crazy
child
and
when
the
party
was
over
queen
bess
stood
at
the
door
and
we
passed
out
shaking
hands
with
her
and
giving
her
our
thanks
she
stood
steadying
herself
against
the
door
beam
and
saying
to
each
of
us
as
she
shook
our
hands
god
love
you
god
love
you
for
bringing
happiness
to
a
blankety
blank

like

i
nodded
in
silence
as
the
great
salvini
arose
and
moved
across
the
room
a
dapper
figure
in
a
scarlet
dressing
gown
and
green
silk
slippers
he
returned
with
a
fresh
load
of
cigarettes
i
noticed
his
hands
thin
fingers
like
a
woman
they
quivered
perceptibly
as
he
lighted
his
smoke
and
i
marveled
at
this
that
the
wizard
fingers
of
the
great
gabriel
salvini
should
shake

story
he
resumed
i

he
clapped
his
hand
despairingly
over
his
heart

suffer
every
day
every
night
and
why
because

the
great

the
wavering
elfin
proportions
of
the
lucia

the
air
with
his
hands
and
i
say
to
her

salvini
the
great

against
the
board
framed
by
the
beautiful
knives
that

exactly
around
her
to
an
inch

a
quarter
inch
to
a
hair
from

happy
i
am
and
so
we
go
on
i
train
all
the
time
soon
i
know
the
outline
of
my
lucia
so
well
i
can
close
my
eyes
and
throw
knives
at
her
and
always
they
come
with
the
point
only
a
hair
away
from
her
body
i
pin
her
dress
against
the
board
her
arms
she
stretch
out
and
i
give
her
two
sleeves
of
knives
and
for
five
years
no
for
eight
years
everything
go
well
never
once
i
touch
her
always
i
watch
her
eyes
when
i
throw
and
her
eyes
give
me
courage
but
then
what
happen
ah
ten
thousand
devils
she
begin
she
grow
fat
one
night
i
send
a
knife
through
the
skin
of
her
arm
i
can
not
go
on
with
the
act

must
stop
i
break
down
and
weep
for
i
love
her
so
much
the
blood
that
comes
from
her
arm
drive
me
crazy
but
i
say
did
the
great
salvini
make
such
a
mistake
it
is
incredible
then
i
look
at
her
and
i
see
something
she
is
getting
fat
name
of
god
i
shudder
i
say
we
are
ruined
you

fat
i
can
only
throw
knives
at
you
like
you
were
like
we
have
studied
together
you
get
fat
i
must
change
my
throw
i
can
not
the
great
salvini
raised
his
shoulders
in
a
despairing
shrug
two
years
ago
that
was
he
whispered
she
weigh
one
hundred
fifty
pounds
when
we
marry
so
pretty
so
light
she
is
but
now
she
weigh
already
two
hundred
pounds
and
she
is
going
up
she
will
not
listen
to
me
it
is
the
eat
the
eat
the
terrible
eat
which
do
this
and
every
night
when
we
perform
i
shiver
i
grow
cold
i
stand
looking
at
her
as
she
take
her
place
on
the
board
and
i
see
she
have
grow
bigger
perhaps
it
is
nothing
to
you
a
woman
grown
bigger
but
to
salvini
it
is
ruin
i
throw
the
knife
zip
it
goes
and
i
close
my
eyes
each
time
i
no
longer
dare
give
her
the
beautiful
frame
as
before
but
i
must
throw
away
because
for
eight
years
i
have
thrown
at
a
target
of
pounds
and
my
art
can
not
change
some
day
she
will
be
sorry
yes
some
day
she
will
understand
what
she
is
doing
to
me
she
will
eat
eat
until
she
grow
so
fat
that
it
is
all
my
target
that
i
mastered
on
the
honeymoon
and
i
will
throw
the
knife
over
she
will
no
longer
be
lucia
and
it
will
hit
name
of
god
it
will
hit
her
and
sink
in
well
she
will
have
learned
a
lesson
then
signor
she
will
have
learned
but
me
i
will
be
ruined
they
will
laugh
they
will
say
the
great
salvini
is
done
he
can
not
throw
the
knives
any
more
look
last
night
he
hit
his
wife
twice
three
times
he
threw
the
knives
into
her
it
is
the
stubbornness
of
womankind
i
will
tell
you
why
does
she
eat
eat
eat
why
does
she
grow
fat
because
she
no
longer
loves
me
no
she
do
it
on
purpose
to
ruin
me
and
the
great
salvini
covered
his
ears
with
his
hands
as
the
phonograph
continued
relentlessly
one
two
one
two
higher
two
letters
one
of
the
drawers
in
my
desk
is
full
of
letters
that
people
have
sent
in
some
of
them
are
knocks
or
boosts
but
most
of
them
are
tips
there
are
several
hundred
tips
on
stories
in
the
drawer
today
while
looking
them
over
i
thought
that
these
tips
were
a
story
in
themselves
to
begin
with
the
different
kinds
of
stationery
and
the
different
kinds
of
handwriting
you
would
think
that
stationery
and
handwriting
so
varied
would
contain
varied
suggestions
and
varied
points
of
view
but
from
the
top
of
the
pile
to
the
bottom
through
letters
written
on
different
kinds
of
paper
there
runs
only
one
tip
and
in
the
different
kinds
of
handwriting
there
runs
only
one
story
there
is
a
man
i
see
almost
every
day
on
my
way
home
from
work
writes
one
and
i
think
he
would
make
a
good
story
there
is
something
queer
about
him
he
keeps
mumbling
to
himself
all
the
time
this
tip
is
on
plain
and
i
see
the
old
woman
frequently
writes
another
nobody
knows
who
she
is
or
what
she
does
she
is
sure
a
woman
of
mystery
you
ought
to
be
able
to
get
a
good
story
out
of
her
this
tip
is
on
pink
stationery
i
think
you
can
find
him
around
midnight
walking
through
the
city
hall
he
walks
through
the
hall
every
midnight
and
whistles
queer
tunes
nobody
has
ever
talked
to
him
and
they
do
know
what
he
does
there
there
is
certainly
a
queer
story
in
that
man
this
tip
is
written
on
a
business
letterhead
she
lives
in
a
back
room
and
so
far
as
anybody
knows
has
no
occupation
there
something
awfully
queer
about
her
and
i
often
wondered
what
the
mystery
about
her
really
was
wo
you
look
her
up
and
write
it
out
her
address
is
this
tip
is
on
monogrammed
paper
i
been
waiting
for
you
to
write
about
the
queer
old
man
who
hangs
out
on
the
dearborn
street
bridge
i
passed
him
frequently
and
he
always
at
the
same
place
i
wondered
time
and
again
what
his
history
was
and
why
he
always
stood
in
the
same
place
this
tip
is
on
a
stationery
he
sells
hot
beans
in
the
loop
and
he
an
he
always
laughing
and
whenever
i
see
him
i
think
a
story
in
that
old
man
there
sure
something
odd
about
him
this
tip
is
on
scratch
paper
i
saw
her
first
several
years
ago
she
was
dressed
all
in
black
and
was
running
as
it
was
past
midnight
i
thought
it
strange
but
i
seen
her
since
and
always
late
at
night
and
she
always
running
she
must
be
about
forty
years
old
and
from
what
i
could
see
of
her
face
a
very
curious
kind
of
woman
in
fact
we
call
her
the
woman
of
mystery
in
our
neighborhood
come
out
to
oakley
avenue
some
night
and
see
for
yourself
there
a
wonderful
story
in
that
running
woman
i
certain
this
tip
is
signed
a
stenographer
they
continue
tips
on
strange
weird
curious
odd
old
chuckling
mysterious
men
and
women
solitaries
enigmatic
figures
moving
silently
through
the
streets
nameless
ones
exiles
from
the
free
and
easy
conformity
of
the
town
if
you
should
read
these
letters
all
through
at
one
sitting
you
would
get
a
very
strange
impression
of
the
city
you
would
see
a
procession
of
mysterious
figures
flitting
through
the
streets
an
unending
swarm
of
dim
ones
queer
ones
and
then
as
you
kept
on
reading
this
procession
would
gradually
focus
into
a
single
figure
this
is
because
all
the
letters
are
so
nearly
alike
and
because
the
mysterious
ones
offered
as
tips
are
described
in
almost
identical
terms
so
the
dim
ones
the
queer
ones
would
become
a
composite
and
you
would
have
in
your
thought
the
image
of
a
single
one
a
huge
nebulous
caricature
hooded
its
head
lowered
its
eyes
peering
furtively
from
under
shaggy
brows
its
thin
fingers
fumbling
under
a
great
black
cloak
its
feet
moving
in
a
soundless
shuffle
over
the
pavement
sometimes
i
have
gone
out
and
found
the
woman
of
mystery
given
in
a
letter
usually
an
embittered
creature
living
in
the
memory
of
wrongs
that
life
has
done
her
or
a
psychopathic
case
suffering
from
hallucinations
or
at
war
with
its
own
impulses
and
each
of
them
has
said
i
hate
people
i
do
like
this
neighborhood
and
i
keep
to
myself
the
letters
all
ask
who
is
this
one
but
that
does
begin
to
answer
the
question
the
letters
ask
who
is
it
the
story
of
the
odd
ones
is
perhaps
no
more
interesting
than
the
story
that
might
be
written
of
the
letters
that
tip
them
off
a
story
here
of
the
harried
buried
little
figures
that
make
up
the
swarm
of
the
city
and
of
the
way
they
glimpse
mystery
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
of
the
way
they
pause
for
a
moment
on
their
treadmill
to
wonder
about
the
silent
shuffling
caricature
with
its
hooded
face
and
its
thin
fingers
groping
under
its
heavy
black
cloak
in
another
drawer
i
have
stored
away
letters
of
another
kind
letters
that
the
caricature
sends
me
queer
marvelous
scrawls
that
remind
one
of
spiders
and
bats
swinging
against
white
backgrounds
these
letters
are
seldom
signed
they
are
written
almost
invariably
on
cheap
blue
lined
pad
paper
there
are
at
least
two
hundred
of
them
and
if
you
should
read
them
all
through
at
one
sitting
you
would
get
a
strange
sense
that
this
caricature
of
the
hooded
face
was
talking
to
you
that
the
queer
one
who
shuffles
through
the
streets
was
sitting
beside
you
and
whispering
marvelous
things
into
your
ear
he
writes
of
the
stars
of
inventions
that
will
revolutionize
man
of
discoveries
he
has
made
of
new
continents
to
be
visited
of
trips
to
the
moon
and
of
buried
races
that
live
beneath
the
rivers
and
mountains
he
writes
of
amazing
crimes
he
has
committed
of
weird
longings
that
will
not
let
him
sleep
and
too
he
writes
of
strange
gods
which
man
should
worship
he
pours
out
his
soul
in
a
fantastic
scrawl
he
says
one
is
all
god
looked
down
and
saw
ants
the
wheel
of
life
turns
seven
times
and
you
can
see
between
you
will
sometime
understand
this
but
now
you
have
curtains
on
your
eyes
now
that
you
have
read
all
the
letters
the
city
becomes
a
picture
an
office
in
which
sits
a
business
man
dictating
to
a
pretty
stenographer
they
are
hard
at
work
but
as
they
work
their
eyes
glance
furtively
out
of
a
tall
thin
window
some
one
is
passing
outside
the
window
a
strange
figure
hooded
head
down
with
his
hands
moving
queerly
under
his
great
black
cloak
the
mother
she
sat
on
one
of
the
benches
in
the
morals
court
the
years
had
made
a
coarse
mask
of
her
face
there
was
nothing
to
see
in
her
eyes
her
hands
were
red
and
leathery
like
a
man
they
had
done
a
man
work
a
child
slept
in
her
arms
it
was
bundled
up
although
the
courtroom
itself
was
suffocating
she
was
waiting
for
blanche
case
to
come
up
blanche
had
been
arrested
by
a
policeman
for
well
for
what
something
about
a
man
so
she
would
lose
by
not
being
at
work
at
the
store
today
why
did
they
arrest
blanche
she
was
in
that
room
with
the
door
closed
but
the
lawyer
said
not
to
worry
yes
maybe
it
was
a
mistake
blanche
never
did
nothing
blanche
worked
at
the
store
all
day
at
night
blanche
went
out
but
she
was
a
young
girl
and
she
had
lots
of
friends
fine
men
sometimes
they
brought
blanche
home
late
at
night
blanche
was
her
daughter
the
woman
with
the
sleeping
child
in
her
arms
looked
around
the
room
was
nice
a
big
room
with
a
good
ceiling
but
the
people
looked
bad
maybe
they
had
done
something
and
had
been
arrested
there
was
one
man
with
a
bad
face
she
watched
him
he
came
quickly
to
where
she
was
sitting
what
was
he
saying
a
lawyer
no
i
do
want
no
lawyer
the
woman
with
the
child
mumbled
no
no
the
man
went
back
he
kept
pretty
busy
talking
to
lots
of
people
in
the
room
so
he
was
a
lawyer
blanche
had
a
lawyer
she
had
paid
him
a
lot
of
money
shh
paula
the
woman
whispered
paula
was
the
name
of
the
sleeping
child
it
had
stirred
in
the
bundle
shh
she
rocked
sideways
with
the
bundle
and
crooned
over
it
her
heavy
coarsened
face
seemed
to
grow
surprised
as
she
stared
into
the
bundle
the
child
grew
quiet
the
judge
took
his
place
business
started
from
where
she
sat
the
woman
with
the
child
could
hear
anything
she
watched
little
groups
of
men
and
women
form
in
front
of
the
judge
then
they
went
away
and
other
groups
came
the
lawyer
had
said
not
to
worry
just
wait
for
blanche
name
and
then
come
right
up
not
to
worry
shh
paula
shh
there
was
blanche
coming
out
of
the
door

looked
bad

do

the
streets
were
full
of
bums
and
loafers

arrested

worked
hard

up
in
front
like
the
lawyer
said
sure
there
was
blanche
going
now
and
the
lawyer
too
he
had
a
better
face
than
the
other
one
who
came
and
asked
and
is

the
woman
the
lawyer
laughed
because
the
judge
asked

hallway

here
a
note
of
authority
came
into
the
woman
voice
a
girl
of
eighteen
walking
at
her
side
turned
a
rouged
face
aw

bother
me
ma

enough
trouble

the
woman

shoulders
and
turned
to
the
child
in
her
arms
paula
mamma
feed
you
right
away
soon
we
find
place
to
sit
down
shh
paula
when
she
looked
up
blanche
had
vanished
she
stood
still
for
a
while
and
then
holding
the
child
closer
to
her
walked
toward
the
elevator
there
was
nothing
to
see
in
her
eyes
clocks
and
owl
cars
as
they
say
in
the
melodramas
the
city
sleeps
windows
have
said
to
one
another
rooftops
have
tucked
themselves
away
the
pavements
are
still
people
have
vanished
the
darkness
sweeping
like
a
great
broom
through
the
streets
has
emptied
them
the
clock
in
the
window
of
a
real
estate
office
says
two
a
few
windows
down
another
clock
says
ten
minutes
after
two
the
newspaper
man
waiting
for
a
sheffield
avenue
owl
car
walks
along
to
the
next
corner
listening
for
the
sound
of
car
wheels
and
looking
at
the
clocks
the
clocks
all
disagree
they
all
hang
ticking
with
seemingly
identical
and
indisputable
precision
their
white
faces
and
their
black
numbers
speak
in
the
dark
of
the
empty
stores
time
never
sleeps
time
keeps
moving
the
hands
of
the
city
clocks
around
and
around
alas
when
clocks
disagree
what
hope
is
there
for
less
methodical
mechanisms
particularly
such
mechanisms
as
tick
away
inside
the
owners
of
clocks
the
newspaper
man
must
sigh
these
clocks
in
the
windows
of
the
empty
stores
along
sheffield
avenue
seem
to
be
arguing
they
present
their
arguments
calmly
like
meticulous
professors
they
say
eight
minutes
of
two
three
minutes
of
two
two
four
minutes
after
two
ten
minutes
after
two
thus
the
confusions
of
the
day
persist
even
after
the
darkness
has
swept
the
streets
clean
of
people
there
being
nobody
else
to
dispute
the
clocks
take
it
up
and
dispute
the
hour
among
themselves
the
newspaper
man
pauses
in
front
of
one
clock
it
says
six
obviously
here
is
a
clock
not
running
its
hands
have
stopped
and
it
no
longer
ticks
but
thinks
the
newspaper
man
it
is
not
to
be
despised
for
that
at
least
it
is
the
only
clock
in
the
neighborhood
that
achieves
perfect
accuracy
twice
a
day
while
all
the
other
clocks
in
the
street
are
disputing
and
arguing
this
particular
clock
says
six
and
of
all
the
clocks
it
alone
is
precisely
accurate
in
the
distance
a
yellow
light
swings
like
an
idle
lantern
over
the
car
tracks
so
the
newspaper
man
stops
at
the
corner
and
waits
this
is
the
owl
car
it
may
not
stop
sometimes
cars
have
a
habit
of
roaring
by
with
an
insulting
indifference
to
the
people
waiting
for
them
to
stop
at
the
corner
at
such
moments
one
feels
a
fine
rage
as
if
life
itself
had
insulted
one
there
have
been
instances
of
men
throwing
bricks
through
the
windows
of
cars
that
would
stop
and
cheerfully
going
to
jail
for
the
crime
but
this
car
stops
it
comes
to
a
squealing
halt
that
must
contribute
grotesquely
to
the
dreams
of
the
sleepers
in
sheffield
avenue
the
night
is
cool
as
the
car
stands
silent
for
a
moment
it
becomes
with
its
lighted
windows
and
its
gay
paint
like
some
modernized
version
of
the
barque
in
which
jason
journeyed
on
his
quest
the
seats
are
half
filled
the
newspaper
man
stands
on
the
platform
with
the
conductor
and
stares
at
the
passengers
the
conductor
is
an
elderly
man
with
an
unusually
mild
face
the
people
in
the
car
try
to
sleep
their
heads
try
to
make
use
of
the
window
panes
for
pillows
or
they
prop
their
chins
up
in
their
palms
or
they
are
content
to
nod
there
are
several
young
men
whose
eyes
are
reddened
a
young
woman
in
a
cheap
but
fancy
dress
and
several
men
all
of
them
look
bored
and
tired
and
all
of
them
present
a
bit
of
mystery
who
are
these
passengers
through
the
night
and
what
has
kept
them
up
and
where
are
they
going
or
coming
from
the
newspaper
man
has
half
a
mind
to
inquire
instead
he
picks
on
the
conductor
and
as
the
car
bounces
gayly
through
the
dark
cavernous
streets
the
conductor
lends
himself
to
a
conversation
i
been
on
this
line
for
six
years
always
on
the
owl
car
he
says
i
like
it
better
than
the
day
shift
i
was
married
but
my
wife
died
and
i
do
find
much
to
do
with
my
evenings
anyway
no
i
do
know
any
of
these
people
except
there
a
couple
of
workingmen
who
i
take
home
on
the
next
trip
mostly
they
always
strangers
they
been
out
having
a
good
time
i
suppose
it
funny
about
them
i
always
feel
sorry
for
yes
sir
you
ca
help
it
there
some
that
been
out
drinking
or
hanging
around
with
women
and
when
they
get
on
the
car
they
sort
of
slide
down
in
their
seats
and
you
feel
like
there
was
nothing
much
to
what
they
been
doing
pessimistic
no
i
ai
pessimistic
if
you
was
ridin
this
car
like
i
you
see
what
i
mean
it
like
watchin
people
afterwards
i
mean
after
they
done
things
they
always
seem
worse
off
then
i
suppose
it
because
they
all
sleepy
but
standin
here
of
nights
i
feel
that
it
more
than
that
they
tired
sure
enough
but
they
also
feeling
that
things
ai
what
they
cracked
up
to
be
i
seldom
put
anybody
off
the
drunks
are
pretty
sad
and
i
feel
sorry
for
them
they
just
flop
over
and
i
wake
them
up
when
it
comes
their
time
sometimes
there
girls
and
they
look
pretty
sad
and
sometimes
something
really
interestin
comes
off
once
there
was
a
lady
who
was
cryin
and
holdin
a
baby
on
the
third
run
it
was
i
could
see
she
up
and
left
her
house
all
of
a
sudden
on
account
of
a
quarrel
with
her
husband
because
she
was
only
half
buttoned
together
and
once
there
was
a
man
whose
pictures
i
see
in
the
papers
the
next
day
as
having
committed
suicide
i
remembered
him
in
a
minute
well
no
he
did
look
like
he
was
going
to
commit
suicide
he
looked
just
about
like
all
the
other
passengers
tired
and
sleepy
and
sort
of
down
the
conductor
helped
one
of
his
passengers
off
do
you
ever
wonder
what
keeps
these
people
out
or
where
they
going
at
this
time
of
night
the
newspaper
man
pursued
as
the
car
started
up
again
well
said
the
conductor
not
exactly
i
got
it
figured
out
nothing
much
to
that
and
that
they
all
kind
of
alike
they
been
to
parties
or
callin
on
their
girls
or
just
got
restless
or
somethin
what
the
difference
all
i
can
say
about
is
that
you
get
so
after
years
you
feel
sorry
for
all
and
they
all
alike
people
as
ride
on
the
night
run
cars
are
just
more
tired
than
the
people
i
remember
used
to
ride
on
the
day
run
cars
i
was
on
before
my
wife
died
the
clock
in
a
candy
store
window
says
a
few
windows
down
another
clock
says
the
newspaper
man
walks
to
his
home
studying
the
clocks
they
all
disagree
as
before
and
yet
their
faces
are
all
identical
as
identical
as
the
faces
of
the
owl
car
passengers
seem
to
the
conductor
and
here
is
a
clock
that
has
stopped
it
says
twenty
after
four
and
the
newspaper
man
thinks
of
the
picture
the
conductor
identified
in
the
papers
the
next
morning
the
picture
said
something
like
twenty
after
four
at
the
wrong
time
it
all
a
bit
mixed
up
confessions
the
rain
mutters
in
the
night
and
the
pavements
like
dark
mirrors
are
alive
with
impressionistic
cartoons
of
the
city
the
little
silent
street
with
its
darkened
store
windows
and
arc
lamps
is
as
lonely
as
a
train
whistle
over
the
darkened
stores
are
stone
and
wooden
flat
buildings
here
too
the
lights
have
gone
out
people
sleep
the
rain
falls
the
gleaming
pavements
amuse
themselves
with
reflections
i
have
an
hour
to
wait
from
the
musty
smelling
hallway
where
i
stand
the
scene
is
like
an
old
print
an
old
london
print
that
i
have
always
meant
to
buy
and
put
in
a
frame
but
have
never
found
writing
about
people
when
one
is
alone
under
an
electric
lamp
and
thinking
about
people
when
one
stands
watching
the
rain
in
the
dark
streets
are
two
different
diversions
when
one
writes
under
an
electric
lamp
one
pompously
marshals
ideas
one
remembers
the
things
people
say
and
do
and
believe
in
and
slowly
these
things
replace
people
in
one
mind
one
thinks
in
the
calm
of
one
study
is
a
puritan
he
is
viciously
afraid
of
anything
which
will
disturb
the
idealized
version
of
himself
in
which
he
believes
and
wants
other
people
to
believe
yes
one
thinks
is
this
and
is
that
and
it
all
seems
very
simple
people
focus
into
clearly
outlined
ideas
definitions
and
one
can
sit
back
and
belabor
them
hamstring
them
pull
their
noses
expose
their
absurdities
and
derive
a
deal
of
satisfaction
from
the
process
iconoclasm
is
easy
and
warming
under
an
electric
light
in
one
study
but
in
the
rain
at
night
in
the
dark
street
staring
at
darkened
windows
watching
the
curious
reflections
in
the
pavements
it
is
different
in
the
rain
the
night
mutters
and
whispers
people
one
thinks
tired
silent
people
sleeping
in
the
dark
ideas
do
not
come
so
easily
or
so
clearly
the
ennobling
angers
which
are
the
emotion
of
superiority
in
the
iconoclast
do
not
rise
so
spontaneously
and
one
does
not
say
people
are
this
and
people
are
that
no
one
pauses
and
stares
at
the
dark
chatter
of
the
rain
and
a
curious
silence
saddens
one
mind
life
is
apart
from
ideas
and
the
things
that
people
say
and
believe
in
and
for
which
they
die
and
in
behalf
of
which
they
invent
laws
and
codes
these
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
insides
of
people
puritan
hypocrite
criminal
dolt
these
are
masks
it
is
diverting
to
rip
them
in
the
calm
of
one
study
life
that
warms
the
trees
into
green
in
the
summer
that
sends
birds
circling
through
the
air
that
spreads
a
tender
passionate
glow
over
even
the
most
barren
wastes
people
are
but
one
of
its
almost
too
many
children
the
dark
the
rain
the
lights
people
asleep
in
bed
the
wind
the
snow
that
will
fall
tomorrow
the
ice
flowers
sunlight
country
roads
pavements
and
stars
all
these
are
the
same
through
all
of
them
life
sends
its
intimate
and
sacred
breath
one
becomes
aware
of
such
curious
facts
in
the
rain
at
night
and
iconoclasm
like
a
broken
umbrella
hangs
useless
from
one
hand
tomorrow
these
people
who
are
now
asleep
will
be
stirring
giving
vent
to
outrageous
ideas
championing
incredulous
banalities
prostrating
themselves
before
imbecile
superstitions
tomorrow
they
will
rise
and
begin
forthwith
to
lie
quibble
cheat
steal
fourflush
and
kill
each
and
all
inspired
by
the
solacing
monomania
that
every
one
of
their
words
and
gestures
is
a
credible
variant
of
perfection
yes
tomorrow
they
will
be
as
they
were
yesterday
but
in
this
rain
at
night
they
rest
from
their
perfections
they
lay
aside
for
a
few
hours
their
paper
masks
and
one
can
contemplate
them
with
a
curious
absence
of
indignation
or
criticism
there
is
something
warm
and
intimate
about
the
vision
of
many
people
sleeping
in
the
beds
above
the
darkened
store
fronts
of
this
little
street
their
bodies
have
been
in
the
world
so
long
almost
as
long
as
the
stones
out
of
which
their
houses
are
made
so
many
things
have
happened
to
them
so
many
debacles
and
monsters
and
horrors
have
swept
them
off
their
feet
and
always
they
have
kept
on
persisting
through
floods
volcanic
eruptions
plagues
and
wars
heroic
and
incredible
people
endlessly
belaboring
themselves
with
ideas
gods
taboos
and
philosophies
yet
here
they
are
still
in
this
silent
little
street
the
world
has
grown
old
trees
have
decayed
and
races
died
out
but
here
above
the
darkened
store
fronts
lies
the
perpetual
miracle
people
in
whom
life
streams
as
naïve
and
intimate
as
ever
yes
it
is
to
life
and
not
people
one
makes
one
obeisance
toward
life
no
iconoclasm
is
possible
for
even
that
which
is
in
opposition
to
its
beauty
and
horror
must
of
necessity
be
a
part
of
them
it
rains
the
arc
lamps
gleam
through
the
monotonous
downpour
one
can
only
stand
and
dream
how
charming
people
are
since
they
are
alive
how
charming
the
rain
is
and
the
night
and
how
foolish
arguments
are
how
banal
are
these
cerebral
monsters
who
pose
as
iconoclasts
and
devote
themselves
grandiloquently
and
inanely
to
disturbing
the
paper
masks
i
walk
away
from
the
musty
smelling
hallway
a
dog
steps
tranquilly
out
of
the
shadows
nearby
he
surveys
the
street
and
the
rain
with
a
proprietary
calm
it
would
be
amusing
to
walk
in
the
rain
with
a
strange
dog
i
whistle
softly
and
reassuringly
to
him
he
pauses
and
turns
his
head
toward
me
surveying
me
with
an
air
of
vague
discomfort
what
do
i
want
of
him
he
thinks
who
am
i
have
i
any
authority
what
will
happen
to
him
if
he
does
obey
the
whistle
thus
he
stands
hestitating
perhaps
too
i
will
give
him
shelter
a
kindness
never
to
be
despised
a
moment
ago
before
i
whistled
this
dog
was
tranquil
and
happy
in
the
rain
now
he
has
changed
he
turns
fully
around
and
approaches
me
a
slight
cringe
in
his
walk
the
tranquillity
has
left
him
at
the
sound
of
my
whistle
he
has
grown
suddenly
tired
and
lonely
and
the
night
and
rain
no
longer
lure
him
he
has
found
another
companionship
and
so
together
we
walk
for
a
distance
this
dog
and
i
wondering
about
each
other
an
iowa
humoresque
in
a
room
at
the
auditorium
hotel
a
group
of
men
and
women
connected
with
the
opera
were
having
tea
as
they
drank
out
of
the
fragile
cups
and
nibbled
at
the
little
cakes
they
boasted
to
each
other
of
their
love
affairs
and
i
had
the
devil
of
a
time
getting
rid
of
her
was
the
motif
of
the
men
conversation
the
women
said
and
i
just
could
shake
him
it
was
awful
there
was
one
an
american
prima
donna
who
grew
pensive
as
the
amorous
boasting
increased
an
opulent
woman
past
a
robust
enchantress
with
a
sweep
to
her
manner
her
beauty
was
an
exaggeration
exaggerated
contours
colors
features
that
needed
perspective
to
set
them
off
diluted
by
distance
and
bathed
by
the
footlights
she
focused
prettily
into
a
manon
a
thaïs
an
isolde
but
in
the
room
drinking
tea
she
had
the
effect
of
a
too
startling
a
rococo
siren
cramped
for
space
the
barytone
leaned
unctuously
across
the
small
table
and
said
to
her
with
a
preposterous
archness
of
manner
and
how
does
it
happen
my
dear
that
you
have
nothing
to
tell
us
because
she
has
too
much
said
one
of
the
orchestra
men
laughingly
the
prima
donna
smiled
oh
i
can
tell
a
story
as
well
as
anybody
she
said
in
fact
i
was
just
thinking
of
one
you
know
i
was
in
iowa
last
month
and
i
visited
the
town
where
i
was
born
and
lived
as
a
girl
until
i
was
nineteen
funny
again
the
pensive
stare
out
of
the
window
at
the
autumn
sky
and
the
sharp
outlines
of
the
city
roofs
go
on
her
hostess
cried
to
her
guests
she
added
in
the
social
manner
peculiar
to
rambunctious
hostesses
if
mugs
tells
anything
about
herself
you
can
be
sure
it
be
something
immense
go
on
mugs
mugs
is
one
of
the
nicknames
the
prima
donna
is
known
by
among
her
friends
we
went
to
school
together
the
prima
donna
smiled
john
and
i
and
i
do
think
i
ever
loved
anybody
as
i
loved
him
he
used
to
frighten
me
to
death
you
see
i
was
ambitious
i
wanted
to
be
somebody
and
john
wanted
me
to
marry
him
somehow
marriage
was
what
i
wanted
then
there
were
other
things
i
had
started
singing
and
at
night
i
used
to
lie
awake
not
wanting
to
sleep
i
was
so
taken
up
with
my
dreams
and
plans
that
i
hated
to
lose
consciousness
that
a
fact
well
john
grew
more
and
more
insistent
and
one
evening
he
came
to
call
on
me
i
was
alone
on
the
porch
john
was
about
then
that
was
about
twenty
years
ago
he
was
a
tall
young
man
with
lively
eyes
i
thought
him
marvelous
at
the
time
and
he
stood
on
the
steps
of
the
porch
and
talked
to
me
i
never
forgot
a
word
he
said
i
have
never
heard
anything
so
wonderful
since
the
barytone
shrugged
his
shoulders
politely
and
said
hm
oh
i
know
smiled
the
prima
donna
you
the
great
lover
and
all
that
but
you
never
could
talk
as
john
did
that
evening
on
the
porch
in
iowa
he
stood
there
and
said
you
going
to
regret
this
moment
for
the
rest
of
your
life
there
be
nights
when
you
wake
up
shivering
and
crying
and
you
want
to
kill
yourself
why
because
you
did
marry
me
because
you
had
your
chance
to
marry
me
and
turned
it
down
remember
remember
how
i
standing
here
talking
to
you
unknown
a
country
boy
remember
that
when
you
hear
of
me
again
are
you
going
to
do
i
asked
i
going
to
be
president
of
the
united
states
he
said
and
he
said
it
so
that
there
was
truth
in
it
as
i
looked
at
him
standing
on
the
steps
i
felt
frightened
to
death
there
he
was
going
to
be
president
of
the
united
states
and
there
was
i
throwing
the
greatest
chance
in
the
world
away
he
knew
i
believed
him
and
that
made
it
worse
he
went
on
talking
in
a
sort
of
oracular
singsong
that
drove
me
mad
not
asking
you
again
you
had
your
chance
mugs
and
thrown
it
away
all
right
it
not
be
said
afterward
that
john
marcey
made
a
fool
of
himself
the
prima
donna
sighed
yes
she
went
on
looking
into
her
empty
teacup
it
was
he
walked
away
erect
his
shoulders
high
his
body
swinging
and
i
sat
there
shivering
i
had
turned
down
a
president
of
the
united
states
me
a
gawky
little
iowa
girl
and
what
was
worse
i
was
in
love
with
him
too
well
i
remember
sitting
on
the
porch
till
the
folks
came
home
from
prayer
meeting
and
i
remember
going
to
bed
and
lying
awake
all
night
crying
and
shivering
i
did
see
john
marcey
again
i
stayed
only
a
week
longer
and
then
i
came
to
chicago
to
study
music
my
folks
were
able
to
finance
me
for
a
time
but
i
never
forgot
him
it
was
john
who
had
started
me
for
chicago
and
it
was
john
who
kept
me
practicing
eight
hours
a
day
studying
and
practicing
until
i
thought
i
drop
i
was
going
to
make
good
when
he
became
president
i
was
going
to
be
somebody
i
was
going
to
do
what
he
said
i
would
wake
up
cursing
myself
and
remembering
my
lost
chance
so
i
went
right
on
working
my
head
off
and
finally
it
was
paris
and
finally
it
was
a
job
in
london
and
i
never
stopped
working
but
the
funny
part
was
that
i
gradually
forgot
about
john
marcey
when
i
had
arrived
as
an
opera
singer
he
was
entirely
dead
for
me
but
last
month
i
visited
my
home
town
i
was
passing
through
and
could
resist
getting
off
and
looking
up
people
i
knew
as
a
girl
my
folks
are
dead
you
know
and
when
i
walked
down
the
street
the
same
old
funny
little
main
street
i
remembered
john
marcey
and
would
you
believe
it
that
same
feeling
of
fear
came
back
to
me
as
i
had
that
night
on
the
porch
when
he
made
his
speech
i
got
curious
as
the
devil
about
john
and
felt
afraid
to
inquire
but
finally
i
was
talking
to
an
old
old
man
who
runs
the
on
the
corner
of
main
and
sixth
streets
there
recognized
him
through
the
window
and
gone
inside
and
shaken
hands
and
i
asked
him
you
remember
john
marcey
marcey
he
repeated
yes
old
marse
why
yes
sure
and
he
kept
nodding
his
head
then
i
asked
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
become
of
him
and
the
old
druggist
who
was
looking
out
of
his
store
window
adjusted
his
glasses
and
pointed
with
his
finger
he
is
there
he
is
wait
a
minute
i
call
him
and
there
was
john
my
president
of
the
united
states
hunched
over
on
the
seat
of
a
garbage
wagon
driving
a
woebegone
nag
down
the
street
i
grabbed
hold
of
the
druggist
and
said
i
see
him
later
well
i
could
stay
in
that
town
another
minute
i
hurried
to
the
station
and
waited
for
the
next
train
and
kept
thinking
of
john
driving
his
garbage
wagon
and
his
battered
felt
hat
and
his
hangdog
face
until
i
thought
i
go
mad
that
all
laughed
the
prima
donna
that
my
love
story
and
she
stared
pensively
into
the
empty
teacup
as
the
barytone
moved
a
bit
closer
and
began
i
tell
you
about
a
spanish
girl
i
met
in
prague
that
interest
you
the
exile
the
newspaper
man
told
the
story
apropos
of
nothing
at
all
there
was
a
pause
in
the
talk
among
the
dinner
guests
a
very
man
said
well
thank
god
this
radical
excitement
is
over
every
one
agreed
it
was
fortunate
and
the
newspaper
man
an
insufferably
garrulous
person
interjected
that
reminds
me
of
bill
haywood
oh
yes
said
the
hostess
he
was
the
leader
of
all
that
terrible
thing
was
he
he
was
said
the
newspaper
man
i
knew
him
fairly
well
i
covered
the
trial
in
judge
landis
court
where
he
and
a
hundred
or
so
others
were
sent
to
prison
what
was
the
charge
against
them
inquired
the
satisfied
one
i
forget
said
the
newspaper
man
but
i
remember
haywood
the
trial
of
course
had
something
to
do
with
the
war
the
war
was
going
on
then
you
remember
oh
yes
indeed
exclaimed
the
hostess
it
will
take
a
long
time
to
forget
the
war
and
her
eyes
brightened
you
were
going
to
tell
us
about
the
trial
pursued
the
hostess
a
few
minutes
later
oh
there
nothing
much
about
that
said
the
newspaper
man
i
was
principally
interested
in
bill
haywood
for
a
moment
you
know
they
sent
him
to
jail
for
twenty
years
or
so
anyway
that
was
his
sentence
the
scoundrel
ran
away
said
the
very
satisfied
one
funny
they
should
let
a
man
as
unprincipled
and
dangerous
as
haywood
slip
through
their
hands
after
sending
him
to
jail
yes
they
let
him
escape
to
russia
of
all
places
declared
the
hostess
with
indignation
where
he
could
do
the
most
harm
oh
the
government
is
so
stupid
at
times
it
simply
drives
one
furious
or
makes
you
laugh
does
it
yes
he
skipped
his
bond
or
something
said
the
newspaper
man
and
became
an
exile
the
satisfied
one
snorted
exile
he
derided
you
do
call
a
man
an
exile
who
runs
away
from
a
country
he
has
always
despised
and
fought
against
the
last
time
i
saw
him
went
on
the
newspaper
man
as
if
he
were
unruffled
was
about
four
or
five
days
before
he
disappeared
i
was
surprised
to
see
him
i
thought
he
was
serving
his
time
in
jail
i
been
following
the
ins
and
outs
and
i
was
aware
he
had
got
appeals
and
things
and
was
still
at
large
yes
said
the
satisfied
one
that
the
trouble
with
this
country
too
lenient
toward
these
scoundrels
as
if
they
were
entitled
to
justice
murmured
the
newspaper
man
quite
so
our
enemies
are
not
entitled
to
justice
it
is
one
of
my
oldest
notions
but
tell
us
about
what
this
haywood
said
pursued
the
hostess
it
must
have
been
funny
meeting
him
it
was
said
the
newspaper
man
it
was
at
the
columbia
theater
between
acts
in
the
evening
i
had
gone
to
see
a
burlesque
show
there
and
between
acts
i
was
on
the
mezzanine
floor
i
went
out
to
get
a
glass
of
water
as
i
was
coming
back
whom
do
i
see
leaning
against
the
railing
but
old
bill
haywood
i
had
seen
him
for
about
two
years
i
guess
but
he
had
changed
an
iota
the
same
smile
and
his
one
eye
staring
ahead
of
him
with
a
mildly
amused
light
in
it
a
rather
striking
person
was
bill
i
suppose
it
was
because
he
always
seemed
so
calm
outside
he
remembered
me
and
when
i
said
hello
to
him
he
called
me
by
name
and
i
walked
to
his
side
i
started
talking
and
said
what
are
you
doing
here
i
thought
you
were
serving
time
in
six
jails
yet
said
haywood
in
a
few
days
the
sentence
starts
next
week
years
something
like
that
well
said
the
newspaper
man
i
suddenly
remembered
that
he
was
in
a
theater
and
i
got
kind
of
curious
i
asked
what
he
was
doing
in
the
theater
and
he
looked
at
me
and
grinned
all
in
he
said
going
the
pace
for
about
a
month
now
out
every
night
taking
in
all
the
glad
spots
and
high
spots
this
was
so
curious
coming
from
big
bill
that
i
looked
surprised
and
he
went
on
talking
yes
sir
this
big
bill
haywood
the
terror
of
organized
society
was
saying
goodbye
to
his
native
land
as
if
he
were
a
sentimental
playboy
he
was
going
to
jail
because
by
that
time
he
had
all
his
plans
matured
for
his
escape
to
russia
but
he
knew
he
was
going
to
leave
the
country
and
perhaps
never
come
back
again
so
he
was
making
the
rounds
been
to
almost
every
show
in
town
he
went
on
talking
the
musical
comedies
all
the
dramas
all
the
west
side
melodramas
i
been
to
almost
all
the
cafés
the
swell
ones
with
the
waiters
and
the
old
ones
i
known
myself
for
years
i
drew
up
a
list
of
all
these
places
in
town
about
a
month
ago
and
i
been
following
a
schedule
ever
since
i
asked
him
said
the
newspaper
man
if
he
liked
the
plays
he
seen
bill
grinned
at
that
ai
that
said
bill
it
ai
that
it
only
seeing
them
you
know
there
nothing
like
these
kind
of
things
anywhere
else
in
the
world
and
then
the
theater
got
dark
and
we
said
casually
and
went
to
our
different
seats
i
did
see
haywood
again
about
a
week
or
so
later
i
read
the
headline
that
he
had
fled
the
country
nobody
knew
where
he
was
but
people
suspected
and
then
two
weeks
after
that
there
was
the
story
that
he
had
reached
russia
and
was
in
moscow
well
when
i
read
that
said
the
newspaper
man
i
remembered
all
of
a
sudden
how
he
had
stood
leaning
against
the
railing
at
the
columbia
theater
saying
to
something
making
the
rounds
for
a
month
saying
in
his
own
way
to
all
the
places
he
would
never
see
again
kind
of
odd
i
thought
for
bill
haywood
to
do
that
that
is
the
way
nietzsche
would
have
written
a
radical
but
dickens
might
have
written
it
that
way
like
bill
that
why
whenever
i
see
his
name
in
print
now
pursued
the
newspaper
man
i
always
think
of
the
burlesque
chorus
on
the
stage
kicking
their
legs
and
yodeling
jazzily
and
big
bill
haywood
staring
with
his
one
eye
saying
with
his
one
eye
tell
me
he
not
an
exile
laughed
the
newspaper
man
suddenly
on
a
day
like
this
on
a
day
like
this
he
says
on
a
day
like
this
when
the
wind
plays
cello
music
across
the
rooftops
i
think
about
things
the
town
is
like
a
fireless
dimly
lighted
room
yesterday
the
windows
sparkled
with
sunlight
they
stare
like
little
coffin
tops
on
a
day
like
this
he
says
on
this
sort
of
a
day
i
walk
along
smoking
a
pipe
and
wonder
what
i
was
excited
about
yesterday
then
i
remember
he
says
that
once
it
rained
yesterday
and
i
waited
under
the
awning
till
it
ended
i
remember
he
says
that
once
i
walked
swiftly
down
this
street
toward
a
building
on
the
corner
it
was
vastly
important
that
i
reach
this
building
i
remember
he
says
that
there
were
days
i
hurried
down
clark
street
and
days
i
ran
down
monroe
street
now
it
is
windy
again
there
is
long
silence
over
the
noises
of
the
street
the
sky
looks
empty
and
old
there
were
people
gathered
around
an
automobile
that
had
bumped
into
the
curbing
i
stopped
to
watch
them
he
says
there
was
a
man
next
to
me
with
a
heavy
gray
face
with
loose
lips
and
with
intent
eyes
there
was
another
man
and
another
dozens
of
men
all
of
them
people
who
had
been
hurrying
in
the
street
to
get
somewhere
and
here
they
were
standing
and
looking
intently
at
an
automobile
with
a
twisted
wheel
i
became
aware
that
we
were
all
looking
with
a
strange
intensity
at
this
automobile
that
we
all
stood
as
if
waiting
for
something
dozens
of
men
hurrying
somewhere
suddenly
stop
and
stand
for
ten
twenty
thirty
minutes
staring
at
a
broken
automobile
there
was
a
reason
for
this
always
where
there
is
a
machine
at
work
digging
or
hammering
piles
where
there
is
a
horse
fallen
an
auto
crashed
a
flapjack
turner
a
fountain
pen
demonstrator
where
there
is
a
magic
clock
that
runs
nobody
knows
how
or
a
window
puzzle
that
turns
in
a
window
or
anything
that
moves
behind
plate
glass
always
where
there
is
any
one
of
these
things
there
are
people
like
us
standing
riveted
attentive
unwavering
people
on
artificial
errands
hurrying
like
obedient
automations
through
the
streets
people
with
dignified
eyes
people
with
grave
decision
stamped
upon
them
careless
people
all
these
people
look
as
if
they
had
something
in
their
heads
as
if
there
were
things
of
import
driving
them
through
the
streets
but
this
is
an
error
nothing
in
their
heads
they
are
like
the
fish
that
swim
beneath
the
water
a
piece
of
shining
tin
captures
their
eyes
and
they
pause
and
stare
at
it
the
broken
automobile
holds
their
eyes
holds
them
all
riveted
because
because
it
is
something
unordinary
to
look
at
to
think
about
and
there
is
nothing
unordinary
to
look
at
or
think
about
in
their
heads
and
i
too
he
says
on
this
day
when
the
wind
played
cello
music
across
the
rooftops
stood
in
the
crowd
we
were
all
children
i
noticed
more
than
that
infants
infantile
wonder
staring
out
of
our
tired
gray
faces
men
without
thought
men
making
a
curious
little
confession
in
the
busy
street
that
they
were
not
busy
that
there
is
nothing
in
life
at
the
moment
that
preoccupies
them
that
a
broken
automobile
is
a
godsend
a
diversion
a
drama
a
great
happiness
i
smoked
my
pipe
he
says
and
began
to
wonder
again
why
did
they
stare
like
this
and
at
what
and
who
were
these
staring
ones
and
what
was
it
in
them
that
stared
i
thought
of
this
he
says
dead
dreams
and
forgotten
defeats
stood
staring
from
the
curb
at
the
broken
automobile
men
who
had
survived
themselves
who
had
become
compliant
and
automatic
little
forces
in
the
engine
of
the
city
these
were
ourselves
on
the
curb
and
this
is
a
weary
thing
to
remember
about
the
city
when
i
am
tired
he
says
and
the
plot
of
which
i
am
hero
villain
and
greek
chorus
suddenly
vanish
from
my
mind
i
pause
and
look
at
something
behind
plate
glass
a
bauble
catches
my
eye
long
minutes
half
hours
pass
there
is
a
marvelous
plentitude
of
baubles
to
look
at
machines
digging
excavations
scaffoldings
advertisements
never
are
lacking
and
at
such
times
i
begin
to
notice
how
many
of
us
there
are
the
hurry
of
the
streets
is
an
illusion
the
noises
that
rise
in
clouds
and
the
suits
of
clothes
and
hats
that
sweep
by
all
these
things
are
part
of
an
illusion
the
fact
drifts
through
my
tired
senses
that
there
is
an
amazing
silence
in
the
street
the
silence
inside
of
people
heads
everywhere
i
look
i
find
these
busy
ones
these
energetic
ones
stopped
and
standing
like
myself
before
a
bauble
in
a
window
before
a
broken
automobile
of
people
authors
always
make
great
plots
authors
always
write
of
adventures
and
intrigues
of
emotions
and
troubles
and
ideas
which
occupy
people
people
fall
in
love
people
suffer
defeats
people
experience
tragedies
happinesses
and
there
is
no
end
to
the
action
of
people
in
books
but
here
is
a
curious
plot
he
says
on
a
day
like
this
here
is
a
crowd
around
a
broken
automobile
the
broken
automobile
has
trapped
them
betrayed
them
they
realize
the
broken
automobile
as
a
practical
excuse
to
stop
walking
to
stop
moving
to
stop
going
anywhere
or
being
anybody
their
serious
concentration
on
the
broken
wheel
enables
them
to
pretend
that
they
are
logically
interested
in
practical
matters
without
which
pretense
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
exist
without
which
pretense
they
would
become
consciously
dead
they
must
always
seem
to
themselves
as
well
as
to
others
logically
interested
in
something
yes
always
something
but
the
plot
is
and
do
not
misunderstand
this
he
cautions
that
the
pretense
here
around
the
broken
automobile
grows
shallow
enough
to
plumb
there
is
nothing
here
two
dozen
men
standing
dead
on
a
curbing
tricked
into
confessional
by
a
little
accident
so
i
will
begin
a
book
tomorrow
he
says
and
empties
his
pipe
as
he
talks
which
will
have
to
do
with
the
of
people
in
streets
the
of
being
alive
and
being
somebody
and
going
somewhere
and
saying
this
this
garrulous
one
walks
off
with
a
high
whistle
on
his
lips
and
a
grave
triumph
sitting
on
his
shoulders
jazz
band
impressions
the
trombone
player
has
a
straight
part
he
umpah
umps
with
the
conventional
trombone
fatalism
whatever
the
tune
whatever
the
harmonies
trombone
umpah
umps
regardless
umpah
ump
is
the
soul
of
all
things
cadenzas
glissandos
arpeggios
chromatics
syncopations
blue
melodies
these
are
the
embroidery
of
sound
from
year
to
year
these
change
these
pass
only
the
umpah
ump
remains
and
tonight
the
trombone
player
plays
what
he
will
play
a
thousand
nights
from
tonight
umpah
ump
the
bassoon
and
the
bull
fiddle
they
umpah
ump
along
underneath
the
quaver
and
whine
of
the
jazz
they
beat
the
time
they
make
the
tuneless
rhythm
the
feet
dancing
on
the
crowded
cabaret
floor
listen
cautiously
for
the
trombone
the
bassoon
and
the
bull
fiddle
they
have
a
liaison
with
the
umpah
umps
the
feet
long
ago
they
danced
only
to
the
umpah
umps
there
were
no
cadenzas
glissandos
arpeggios
then
there
was
only
the
thumping
of
cedar
wood
on
cedar
wood
on
ebony
or
taut
deerskin
civilizations
have
risen
fallen
and
risen
again
armies
gods
races
have
been
chewed
into
mist
by
the
years
but
the
thumping
remains
the
feet
of
the
dancers
on
the
cabaret
floor
keep
a
rendezvous
with
the
ebony
on
the
taut
deerskin
with
the
cedar
wood
beating
on
cedar
wood
the
clarinet
screeches
wails
moans
and
whistles
the
clarinet
flings
an
obbligato
high
over
the
heads
of
the
dancers
on
the
cabaret
floor
it
makes
shrill
sounds
it
raves
like
a
fireless
ophelia
it
plays
the
clown
the
tragedian
the
acrobat
a
whimsical
insanity
lurks
in
the
music
of
the
clarinet
it
stutters
ecstasies
it
postures
like
tristan
and
whimpers
like
a
nag
it
grimaces
like
peer
gynt
and
winks
like
a
lounge
lizard
a
cake
eater
it
is
not
for
the
feet
of
the
dancers
on
the
crowded
cabaret
floor
the
feet
follow
the
umpah
umps
the
thoughts
of
the
dancers
follow
the
clarinet
the
thoughts
of
the
boobilariat
dance
easily
to
the
tangled
lyric
of
the
clarinet
the
thoughts
tie
themselves
into
crazy
knots
the
music
of
the
clarinet
becomes
like
crazily
uncoiling
whips
the
thoughts
of
the
dancers
shake
themselves
loose
from
words
under
the
spur
of
the
whips
they
begin
to
dance
not
as
the
feet
dance
there
is
another
rhythm
here
the
rhythm
of
little
ecstasies
whimpering
thus
the
thoughts
of
the
dancers
dance
dead
hopes
wearied
ambitions
vanishing
youth
do
an
inarticulate
in
the
heads
of
the
dancers
on
the
cabaret
floor
the
cornet
wears
a
wooden
gag
in
its
mouth
and
a
battered
black
derby
hangs
over
its
end
umpah
ump
from
the
trombone
the
bull
fiddle
and
the
bassoon
tangled
lyrics
from
the
clarinet
and
the
cornet
cakewalks
like
a
hoyden
vampire
the
cornet
whinnies
like
an
odalisque
expiring
in
the
arms
of
the
wizard
of
oz
lust
giggles
at
a
sly
jest
out
of
the
cornet
passion
thumbs
its
nose
at
the
stars
out
of
the
cornet
the
melody
of
jazz
the
tin
pan
ghosts
of
chopin
tchaikowsky
old
black
joe
liszt
and
mumbo
magumbo
jungle
troubadour
of
the
congo
come
whinnying
out
from
under
the
pendant
derby
the
dancers
on
the
cabaret
floor
close
their
eyes
and
grin
to
themselves
the
cornet
kids
them
along
when
they
grow
sad
it
burlesques
their
sorrow
the
cornet
laughs
at
them
it
leers
like
a
satyr
master
of
ceremonies
at
them
it
is
pan
in
a
clown
suit
silenus
on
a
trick
mule
eros
in
a
pullman
smoker
laugh
dance
jerk
wiggle
and
kid
all
you
want
but
the
lady
of
the
sea
foam
whispers
a
secret
aphrodite
become
a
female
barytone
still
takes
herself
very
seriously
aphrodite
alas
is
always
serious
she
gurgles
a
sonorous
plaint
out
of
the
saxophone
the
cornet
sneers
at
her
the
clarinet
sneaks
up
on
her
and
tweaks
her
nose
the
trombone
the
bull
fiddle
and
the
bassoon
ignore
her
altogether
and
the
dancers
on
the
cabaret
floor
are
too
busy
to
dance
to
her
simple
wails
yet
there
is
no
mistake
aphrodite
the
queen
abandoned
by
her
courtiers
and
surrounded
by
this
galaxy
of
mountebanks
is
still
aphrodite
and
sad
lipped
she
walks
invisible
among
the
dancers
on
the
cabaret
floor
and
they
listen
to
her
voice
out
of
the
saxophone
the
drums
the
piano
and
the
violin
give
her
a
fluttering
drape
but
there
are
things
to
be
seen
this
is
not
the
aphrodite
of
the
blue
danube
waltz
but
a
duskier
more
mystical
lady
there
are
no
roses
on
her
cheeks
no
lilies
in
her
skin
she
is
colored
like
a
panther
flower
and
her
limbs
are
heavy
with
taboo
magic
but
she
is
still
imperial
in
vain
the
mountebanks
and
burlesqueries
of
her
court
her
lips
place
themselves
against
the
hearts
of
the
dancers
on
the
cabaret
floor
and
she
croons
her
ancient
hymns
the
hearts
of
the
dancers
give
themselves
to
the
saxophone
their
feet
keep
a
rendezvous
with
the
umpah
umps
their
thoughts
dance
on
the
slack
wire
of
the
clarinet
their
veins
beat
time
to
the
whinny
of
the
derby
wreathed
cornet
the
fiddles
and
the
drums
are
partners
for
their
arms
and
their
muscles
but
their
hearts
embrace
shyly
the
mother
aphrodite
their
hearts
listen
sadly
and
proudly
and
they
almost
forget
to
dance
midnight
approaches
enameled
faces
stenciled
smiles
painted
eyes
and
slants
of
colored
hats
these
are
the
women
careless
polite
suave
grinning
these
are
the
men
the
jazz
band
plays
the
cabaret
floor
jammed
seems
to
be
moving
around
like
a
groaning
turnstile
bodies
are
hidden
the
spotlight
from
the
balcony
begins
to
throw
a
series
of
colors
melody
is
lost
the
jazz
band
is
hammering
like
a
mad
blacksmith
whang
bam
whang
bam
nobody
hears
the
music
of
the
band
bodies
together
move
on
the
turnstile
floor
this
is
the
part
of
the
feast
of
belshazzar
that
the
authorities
censored
in
a
griffith
movie
this
is
the
description
of
tiberius
court
that
the
authorities
suppressed
here
are
the
poems
that
hide
on
the
forbidden
shelves
of
the
public
library
the
pulp
of
figures
dissolves
the
hammering
band
has
finished
men
and
women
grown
suddenly
polite
and
social
return
to
their
tables
citizens
of
a
neighborhood
toilers
clerks
fourflushers
wives
husbands
gropers
nobodies
watch
and
see
where
they
go
into
the
brick
holes
into
the
apartment
buildings
they
pack
themselves
away
like
ants
in
an
anthill
the
nobodies
the
gropers
husbands
fourflushers
but
they
made
a
violent
picture
a
moment
ago
under
the
revolving
colors
of
the
floodlight
and
the
hammering
whinnying
music
of
the
jazz
band
they
became
again
the
mask
of
dionysus
the
ancient
satanical
mask
which
nature
slips
over
her
head
when
in
quest
of
diversion
night
diary
where
is
the
moon
gone
this
inferior
luminary
can
not
compete
with
the
corset
ad
signs
and
the
ice
cream
ad
signs
that
blaze
in
the
night
sky
we
stand
on
a
bridge
that
connects
state
street
and
look
at
the
river
there
are
night
shapes
but
first
we
see
the
dark
water
of
the
river
and
silver
gold
and
ruby
reflections
of
the
bridge
lights
these
hang
like
carnival
ribbons
in
the
water
the
l
trains
crawl
over
the
wells
street
bridge
and
the
water
below
them
becomes
alive
with
a
moving
silver
image
for
a
moment
the
reflection
of
the
l
trains
in
the
river
seems
like
a
ghostly
waterfall
then
it
changes
and
becomes
something
else
what
the
light
reflections
in
the
dark
water
are
baffling
it
is
a
game
to
stand
on
the
bridge
and
make
up
similes
about
them
they
look
like
this
like
that
like
something
else
like
golden
pillars
like
chinese
writing
like
monotonous
exclamation
points
there
are
boat
shapes
the
river
docks
bulge
with
shadows
the
boat
shapes
emerge
slowly
from
the
shadows
these
shapes
unlike
the
river
reflections
do
not
suggest
similes
they
bulge
in
the
darkness
and
their
vanished
outlines
remind
one
of
something
what
of
boats
of
ships
of
men
men
and
ships
little
lanterns
hang
like
elfin
watchmen
from
the
sterns
of
ships
the
bulldog
noses
of
tugboats
sleep
against
the
docks
high
overhead
the
corset
ad
and
the
ice
cream
ad
blaze
wink
and
go
out
and
turn
on
so
as
to
attract
the
preoccupied
eyes
of
people
far
away
then
the
bridges
count
themselves
to
the
west
first
bridge
second
bridge
third
bridge
street
cars
auto
lights
and
vague
noises
jerk
eerily
over
the
bridges
the
sleeping
tugboats
launches
and
lake
craft
remind
one
of
nothing
at
all
except
that
there
are
engines
but
as
one
stares
at
them
they
become
secret
there
is
something
mysterious
about
abandoned
engines
it
is
almost
as
if
one
saw
the
bodies
of
men
lying
in
shadows
engines
and
men
are
inseparable
and
these
boats
that
sleep
in
the
river
shadows
are
parts
of
men
amputations
the
night
shapes
increase
there
are
buildings
they
drift
along
the
river
docks
dark
windows
and
faded
brick
lines
their
rooftops
are
like
the
steps
of
a
giant
stairway
that
has
broken
down
where
is
the
moon
here
are
windows
to
mirror
its
distant
silver
instead
the
windows
sleep
the
nervous
electric
signs
that
wink
and
do
tricks
throw
an
intermittent
glare
over
the
windows
do
you
know
the
dark
windows
of
the
city
you
gentlemen
who
write
continually
of
temples
and
art
come
forget
your
love
for
things
you
never
saw
cathedrals
and
parthenons
that
exist
in
the
yesterdays
you
never
knew
come
look
at
the
fire
escapes
that
are
stamped
like
letter
z
against
the
mysterious
rectangles
at
the
rhythmic
flight
of
windows
whose
black
and
silver
wings
are
tipped
with
the
yellow
winkings
of
the
corset
and
ice
cream
signs
the
windows
over
the
dark
river
are
like
an
alphabet
like
the
keyboard
of
a
typewriter
they
are
like
anything
you
want
them
to
be
you
have
only
to
wish
and
the
dark
windows
take
new
patterns
wall
shapes
arise
warehouses
that
have
no
windows
huge
lines
loom
in
the
shadows
a
vast
panel
of
brick
without
windows
rises
vanishes
buildings
that
stand
like
playing
blocks
the
shapes
the
tracks
of
windows
the
patterns
of
rooftops
suggest
things
fortresses
palaces
dungeons
wars
witches
and
cathedrals
but
after
watching
them
they
lose
these
false
significances
they
suggest
nothing
they
are
the
amputations
of
men
things
playthings
men
have
left
behind
for
the
corset
and
the
ice
cream
ads
to
wink
at
and
this
is
the
real
secret
of
their
beauty
the
night
devours
their
meaning
and
leaves
behind
lines
angles
geometries
rhythms
and
lights
and
these
things
that
have
no
meaning
that
suggest
nothing
that
are
not
the
symbols
of
ideas
or
events
these
become
beautiful
there
are
several
people
standing
on
this
bridge
loiterers
their
elbows
rest
on
the
railing
their
faces
are
hidden
in
their
hands
they
stare
into
the
scene
a
hoarse
whistle
toots
at
wells
street
bells
clang
far
away
there
is
a
scurry
of
dim
noises
in
the
dark
something
huge
moves
through
the
air
it
is
a
bridge
opening
its
arms
make
a
massive
gesture
upward
a
boat
is
coming
through
a
heavy
shape
drifting
among
the
carnival
ribbons
that
hang
down
in
the
black
water
noises
that
have
different
tones
boat
whistles
bridge
bells
electric
alarm
tinglings
and
the
swish
of
water
like
the
sound
of
wood
tapping
wood
lights
that
have
different
colors
the
yellow
of
electric
signs
around
one
of
them
that
hoists
its
message
in
the
air
runs
a
green
border
the
electric
lights
quiver
and
run
round
the
glaring
frame
like
a
mysterious
green
water
red
gold
and
silver
pillars
in
the
water
gray
blue
and
black
shadows
elfin
lanterns
l
trains
like
illuminated
caterpillars
creeping
over
wells
street
waterfalls
of
silver
chinese
writing
in
ruby
black
lead
and
silver
windows
and
a
thousand
shades
of
darkness
from
bronze
to
strange
greens
all
these
are
things
that
the
loitering
ones
leaning
on
the
bridge
rail
know
how
nicely
the
hoods
of
automobiles
hide
the
twisted
lines
of
the
gas
engines
under
them
smooth
as
chariots
curved
and
graceful
as
greyhounds
pigeons
rabbits
the
state
street
begins
after
one
passes
odors
this
is
south
water
street
a
swept
dusted
and
wonderfully
silent
street
white
wings
have
scrubbed
its
worn
body
but
the
odors
deepen
with
the
night
farm
odors
food
odors
an
aroma
of
decay
surrounds
them
by
their
smells
one
can
almost
detect
the
presence
of
chickens
eggs
oranges
cabbages
potatoes
plums
and
cantaloupes
a
group
of
movie
theaters
holds
carnival
at
the
entrance
to
the
loop
people
hurry
under
electric
canopies
dig
in
their
pockets
for
dollar
bills
and
buy
tickets
the
buildings
sleep
along
the
river
the
boats
wait
in
the
shadows
movie
signs
crossing
cops
window
tracks
and
different
colored
suits
of
clothes
odors
noises
lights
and
a
mysteriously
tender
pattern
of
walls
these
lie
in
the
night
like
a
reward
we
walk
away
with
memories
when
we
are
traveling
some
day
riding
over
strange
places
these
will
be
things
we
shall
remember
not
words
but
lines
that
mean
nothing
and
the
scene
from
the
bridge
will
bring
a
sad
confusion
into
our
heads
and
we
shall
sit
staring
at
famous
monuments
battlefields
antiquities
and
whisper
to
ourselves
wish
i
was
back
wish
i
was
back
the
lake
the
lake
asks
an
old
question
as
you
ride
to
work
or
come
home
from
work
on
the
train
the
train
shoots
along
and
out
of
the
window
the
lake
turns
slowly
like
a
great
wheel
there
is
a
curious
optical
illusion
as
if
the
train
were
riding
frantically
on
the
rim
of
a
great
wheel
and
the
wheel
were
turning
in
an
opposite
direction
perhaps
this
illusion
makes
it
seem
as
if
the
lake
were
asking
an
old
question
as
you
ride
along
its
edge
where
you
going
people
looking
out
of
the
train
window
seem
to
grow
sad
as
they
stare
at
the
lake
but
this
does
not
apply
to
train
riders
alone
in
the
summer
time
there
are
the
revelers
on
the
municipal
pier
and
the
beach
loungers
and
all
others
who
sit
or
take
walks
within
sight
of
the
water
during
the
summer
day
the
beaches
are
lively
and
the
bathing
suits
and
parasols
offer
little
carnival
panels
at
the
ends
of
the
east
running
streets
as
you
pass
them
on
the
north
side
bus
or
on
the
south
side
the
sun
the
swarm
of
bathers
smeared
like
bits
of
brightly
colored
paint
across
the
yellow
sand
and
the
obliterating
sweep
of
water
remind
you
of
the
modernist
artists
whose
pictures
are
usually
lithographic
blurs
yet
winter
and
summer
even
when
the
thousands
upon
thousands
of
bathers
cover
the
sand
like
a
shower
of
confetti
and
when
there
are
shouts
and
circus
excitements
along
the
beach
people
who
look
at
the
lake
seem
always
to
become
sad
one
wonders
why
perhaps
it
is
because
the
inanimate
sweep
of
the
water
its
hugeness
and
silence
make
one
forget
the
petty
things
and
the
greedy
trifles
which
form
the
routine
of
one
day
and
when
one
forgets
these
things
one
remembers
alas
something
they
pleasantly
obscured
by
their
presence
a
dream
perhaps
buried
long
ago
a
hope
an
emotion
successfully
interred
under
the
amiable
rubbish
the
days
have
piled
up
then
too
there
is
the
question
where
you
going
and
an
answer
to
it
that
seems
to
come
out
of
the
long
reaches
of
water
come
with
me
somewhere
nowhere
these
thoughts
play
in
people
minds
without
words
they
are
almost
more
a
part
of
the
lake
than
of
their
thinking
as
if
they
were
in
fact
lake
thoughts
another
reason
why
people
grow
sad
when
they
look
at
the
water
of
the
lake
is
perhaps
that
the
lake
offers
them
an
escape
from
the
tawdry
nagging
little
responsibilities
of
the
day
that
go
with
being
a
citizen
and
a
breadwinner
not
that
it
invites
to
suicide
quite
the
reverse
it
invites
to
living
to
doing
something
that
has
a
sweep
to
it
that
has
a
swagger
to
it
to
setting
sail
for
strange
ports
where
strange
adventures
wait
so
as
the
trains
rush
their
thousands
to
work
and
home
again
the
citizens
and
breadwinners
let
their
imaginations
gallop
toward
a
faraway
horizon
and
these
imaginations
came
galloping
back
again
and
the
breadwinners
are
saddened
by
a
memory
yes
they
were
for
a
moment
rovers
egad
swashbucklers
gentlemen
and
ladies
of
fortune
free
of
the
rigamarole
burdens
that
keep
them
on
the
treadmill
and
now
they
are
again
passengers
going
to
work
going
home
to
go
to
work
again
tomorrow
it
is
easy
to
think
that
this
is
the
secret
of
the
sad
little
grimace
the
lake
brings
to
the
eyes
of
the
train
riders
this
discourse
is
becoming
a
bit
dolorous
but
the
subject
rather
requires
an
andante
treatment
the
city
press
agents
will
tell
you
quite
another
story
about
the
lake
about
the
city
playground
and
how
conducive
it
is
to
healthful
sport
and
joyous
recreation
but
on
the
other
hand
there
is
this
other
side
so
to
speak
of
the
lake
for
the
lake
belongs
to
those
familiar
things
that
surprise
people
into
uncomfortable
silences
one
could
as
easily
write
about
the
sky
in
this
vein
since
the
lake
like
the
sky
challenges
the
monotony
of
people
lives
with
another
monotony
the
monotony
of
nature
that
seems
to
engulf
obliterate
reduce
to
puny
proportions
the
routine
by
which
people
live
and
which
fortunately
they
delude
themselves
into
admiring
there
is
also
the
question
of
beauty
this
is
a
delicate
issue
to
introduce
into
one
daily
reading
and
the
reader
pardon
is
solicited
with
proper
humiliation
and
yet
there
is
a
question
of
beauty
of
soul
states
and
aesthetic
nuances
involved
in
the
consideration
of
the
lake
beauty
by
one
definition
is
the
sensatory
excitement
stirred
in
people
by
the
rhythm
of
line
the
vibration
of
color
the
play
of
motion
and
the
surprise
of
idea
it
is
usually
a
saddening
effect
that
beauty
produces
and
perhaps
this
is
because
beauty
is
something
like
an
illumination
that
while
admirable
in
itself
throws
into
pathetic
evidence
all
the
ugly
and
unbeautiful
things
of
one
life
in
this
somewhat
involved
aesthetic
principle
there
is
probably
another
hint
at
the
causes
of
the
sadness
people
show
when
they
look
at
the
lake
today
the
lake
wears
its
autumn
aspect
out
of
the
train
window
one
sees
a
wedge
of
geese
flying
south
or
occasionally
a
lone
bird
circling
like
an
endless
note
over
the
water
the
waves
look
cold
and
their
symmetrical
crisscross
makes
one
think
of
the
chill
lonely
nights
that
beckon
outside
the
coziness
of
one
home
windows
on
summer
days
the
lake
is
sometimes
like
a
huge
lavender
leaf
veined
with
gold
sometimes
it
becomes
festive
and
wears
the
awning
stripes
of
cloud
and
sun
or
it
grows
serene
and
reminds
one
of
a
superb
domesticity
as
it
lies
pointed
like
a
grate
arched
like
a
saucer
or
the
back
of
a
sleeping
kitten
but
today
its
autumn
is
a
bit
depressing
it
no
longer
lures
toward
strange
adventure
instead
its
grayness
seems
to
say
to
one
stay
away
stay
away
hide
away
in
warm
houses
and
warm
overcoats
men
are
little
things
puny
things
it
is
when
one
leaves
the
city
and
goes
to
visit
or
to
live
in
another
place
where
there
is
no
lake
that
the
lake
grows
y
alive
in
one
mind
one
becomes
thirsty
for
it
and
dreams
of
it
one
remembers
it
then
as
something
that
was
almost
an
essential
part
of
life
like
a
third
dimension
in
some
way
one
associates
one
day
dreams
with
the
lake
and
falls
into
thinking
that
there
is
something
unfinished
sterile
about
living
with
no
lake
at
one
elbow
in
a
short
while
a
month
or
so
the
lake
will
become
a
stage
for
melodrama
the
people
riding
on
its
edge
will
stare
into
mists
they
will
watch
the
huge
mist
shapes
rolling
back
and
forth
over
the
hidden
water
the
blue
of
the
sky
the
cold
sun
the
fog
and
the
freezing
water
will
become
actors
in
a
great
play
and
the
train
windows
will
be
little
prosceniums
inclosing
the
melodrama
of
winter
sergt
kuzick
waterloo
offhand
said
sergt
kuzick
of
the
first
precinct
offhand
i
think
of
any
stories
for
you
if
you
give
me
a
little
time
maybe
i
could
think
of
one
or
two
what
you
want
i
suppose
is
some
story
as
i
know
about
from
personal
experience
like
the
time
for
instance
that
the
indian
busted
out
of
the
bridewell
where
he
was
serving
a
six
months
sentence
and
snuck
home
and
killed
his
wife
and
went
back
again
to
the
bridewell
and
they
did
find
out
who
killed
her
until
he
got
drunk
a
year
later
and
told
a
bartender
about
it
that
the
kind
you
want
ai
it
i
said
it
was
well
said
sergt
kuzick
i
ca
think
of
any
offhand
like
i
said
there
was
a
building
over
on
west
monroe
street
once
where
we
found
three
bodies
in
the
basement
they
was
all
dead
but
that
would
make
a
story
hardly
because
nobody
ever
found
out
who
killed
them
let
me
think
awhile
sergt
kuzick
thought
do
you
remember
the
leggett
mystery
he
inquired
doubtfully
i
guess
that
was
before
your
time
i
was
only
a
patrolman
then
old
leggett
had
a
tobacco
jar
made
out
of
a
human
skull
and
that
how
they
found
out
he
killed
his
wife
it
was
her
skull
it
come
out
one
evening
when
he
brought
his
bride
home
you
know
he
got
married
again
after
killin
the
first
one
and
they
was
having
a
party
and
the
new
bride
said
she
did
want
that
skull
around
in
her
house
old
leggett
got
mad
and
said
he
part
with
that
skull
for
love
or
money
so
when
he
was
to
work
one
day
she
threw
the
skull
into
the
ash
can
and
when
old
leggett
come
home
and
saw
the
skull
missing
he
swore
like
the
devil
and
come
down
to
the
station
to
swear
out
a
warrant
for
his
wife
arrest
chargin
her
with
disorderly
conduct
he
carried
on
so
that
one
of
the
boys
got
suspicious
and
went
out
to
the
house
with
him
and
they
found
the
skull
in
the
ash
can
and
old
leggett
began
to
weep
over
it
so
one
of
the
boys
asked
him
naturally
whose
skull
it
was
he
said
it
was
a
skull
no
more
but
a
tobacco
jar
and
they
asked
him
where
he
got
it
and
he
begun
to
lie
so
hard
that
they
tripped
him
up
and
finally
he
said
it
was
his
first
wife
skull
and
he
was
hung
shortly
afterward
you
see
if
you
give
me
time
i
could
remember
something
like
that
for
a
story
offhand
though
sighed
sergt
kuzick
it
difficult
i
ai
got
it
clear
in
my
head
what
you
want
either
of
course
i
know
it
got
to
be
interestin
or
the
paper
wo
print
it
but
interestin
things
is
pretty
hard
to
run
into
i
remember
one
night
out
to
the
old
morgue
this
was
back
when
i
started
on
the
force
thirty
years
ago
and
more
and
they
was
having
trouble
at
the
morgue
owing
to
the
stiffs
vanishing
and
being
mutilated
they
thought
maybe
it
was
students
carryin
them
off
to
practice
medicine
on
but
it
was
because
they
found
old
pete
that
was
the
colored
janitor
they
had
out
there
he
was
an
african
but
it
turned
out
a
fiji
islander
afterward
they
found
him
dead
in
the
morgue
one
day
and
it
turned
out
he
was
a
cannibal
or
anyway
his
folks
had
been
cannibals
in
fiji
and
the
old
habit
had
come
up
in
him
so
he
could
help
himself
and
he
was
makin
a
diet
off
the
bodies
in
the
morgue
but
he
struck
one
that
was
embalmed
and
the
poison
in
the
body
killed
him
the
papers
did
carry
much
on
it
on
account
of
it
not
very
important
but
i
always
thought
it
was
kind
of
interestin
at
that
that
about
what
you
want
i
suppose
some
story
or
other
like
that
well
let
see
it
hard
sighed
sergt
kuzick
after
a
pause
to
put
your
finger
on
a
yarn
offhand
i
remember
a
lot
of
things
now
come
to
think
of
it
like
the
case
i
was
on
where
a
fella
named
zianow
killed
his
wife
by
pouring
little
pieces
of
hot
lead
into
her
ear
and
he
would
have
escaped
but
he
sold
the
body
to
the
old
county
hospital
for
practicin
purposes
and
while
they
was
monkeying
with
the
skull
they
heard
something
rattle
and
when
they
investigated
it
was
several
pieces
of
lead
inside
rattling
around
so
they
arrested
zianow
and
got
him
to
confess
the
whole
thing
and
he
was
sent
up
for
life
because
it
turned
out
his
wife
had
stabbed
him
four
times
the
week
before
he
poured
the
lead
into
her
while
she
slept
and
frightened
him
so
that
he
did
it
in
in
a
way
i
understand
in
a
general
way
what
you
want
murmured
sergt
kuzick
but
so
help
me
if
i
can
think
of
a
thing
that
you
might
call
interestin
most
of
the
things
we
have
to
deal
with
is
chiefly
murders
and
suicides
and
highway
robberies
like
the
time
old
alderman
mcguire
who
is
dead
now
was
held
up
by
two
bandits
while
going
home
from
a
night
session
of
the
council
and
he
hypnotized
one
bandit
yes
sir
you
may
wonder
at
that
but
you
did
know
mcguire
he
was
a
wonderful
hypnotist
and
he
hypnotized
the
bandit
and
just
as
the
other
one
who
was
hypnotized
was
searching
his
pockets
mcguire
said
to
the
hypnotized
bandit
a
policeman
shoot
this
highwayman
and
the
hypnotized
one
was
the
bandit
who
had
the
gun
and
he
turned
around
as
alderman
mcguire
said
and
shot
the
other
unhypnotized
bandit
and
killed
him
but
when
he
reported
the
entire
incident
to
the
station
i
was
on
duty
that
night
the
captain
would
believe
it
and
tried
to
argue
mcguire
into
saying
it
was
a
accident
and
that
the
gun
had
gone
off
accidentally
and
killed
the
unhypnotized
bandit
but
the
alderman
stuck
to
his
story
and
it
was
true
because
the
hypnotized
bandit
told
me
privately
all
about
it
when
i
took
him
down
to
joliet
i
will
try
said
sergt
kuzick
to
think
of
something
for
you
in
about
a
week
i
begin
to
get
a
pretty
definite
idea
what
you
want
and
i
talk
it
over
with
old
jim
who
used
to
travel
beat
with
me
he
a
great
one
for
stories
old
jim
is
a
man
tan
hardly
think
of
them
offhand
like
you
give
me
a
week
and
the
old
sergeant
sank
into
his
wooden
chair
and
gazed
out
of
the
dusty
station
window
with
a
perplexed
and
baffled
eye
dead
warrior
do
you
want
to
see
the
dead
warriors
come
back
the
fallen
army
come
back
crawling
out
of
its
million
coffins
and
walking
back
across
the
sea
and
across
the
prairie
the
waxen
face
of
youth
come
out
of
its
million
graves
and
its
uniform
hanging
from
its
limp
frame
do
you
want
to
see
the
war
dead
the
young
ones
ripped
to
pieces
in
the
trenches
standing
like
tired
beggars
at
your
back
door
dead
hands
and
dead
eyes
and
wailing
softly
i
was
so
young
i
died
so
soon
all
of
us
from
all
the
countries
who
died
so
soon
we
grow
lonely
on
the
other
side
ah
my
unlived
days
my
uneaten
bread
my
uncounted
years
they
lie
in
a
little
corner
and
nobody
comes
to
them
it
a
jewish
play
called
the
dead
man
and
every
night
in
palace
theater
on
blue
island
avenue
a
thousand
men
and
women
sit
with
staring
eyes
and
watch
this
figure
in
its
come
dragging
back
like
a
tired
beggar
come
moaning
back
with
the
cry
my
unlived
days
my
uneaten
bread
my
uncounted
years
he
stands
between
hamlet
and
peer
gynt
this
strangely
motionless
one
who
has
thrown
the
west
side
into
an
uproar
there
is
no
drama
around
him
he
is
a
dead
young
man
in
uniform
walking
slowly
limply
through
three
acts
this
is
all
one
remembers
that
his
eyes
were
open
and
unseeing
that
his
arms
hung
like
a
scarecrow
and
that
the
fingers
of
his
hands
were
curled
in
and
motionless
they
talk
to
him
in
the
play
the
scene
is
a
jewish
village
in
poland
the
war
has
ended
famine
disease
and
poverty
remain
refugees
dying
ones
starving
ones
huddle
together
in
the
dismantled
synagogue
no
one
knows
what
has
happened
the
armies
have
passed
flame
and
blood
brightened
the
sky
for
a
time
now
the
little
village
lies
cut
off
from
the
world
and
its
people
clutch
desperately
to
the
hem
of
life
no
news
has
come
wanderers
stagger
down
the
torn
roads
with
crazy
tidings
and
the
old
men
of
the
synagogue
sit
shivering
over
their
prayer
books
a
world
has
been
blown
into
fragments
and
this
scene
is
one
of
the
fragments
sholom
ash
who
wrote
this
play
spent
a
time
in
villages
abroad
as
a
jewish
relief
worker
and
he
brought
back
this
scene
a
bedlam
of
despair
a
merciless
photograph
that
stares
across
the
footlights
for
a
the
story
begins
there
is
a
village
leader
in
whose
veins
the
will
to
live
still
throbs
he
exhorts
the
shivering
ones
there
will
be
a
wedding
he
will
give
his
daughter
in
marriage
there
will
be
feasting
the
dead
are
dead
the
duty
of
the
living
ones
is
to
live
let
the
old
women
prepare
food
and
the
men
will
sing
life
will
begin
over
and
a
new
village
will
be
built
up
but
the
daughter
hangs
back
she
talks
of
the
young
man
whom
she
married
and
who
went
away
to
war
he
is
dead
poor
child
the
father
says
no
no
he
is
dead
i
dreamed
he
was
still
alive
she
answers
but
the
festival
starts
the
starving
ones
sing
in
the
broken
synagogue
there
will
be
a
wedding
life
will
begin
but
there
is
something
in
the
ruined
doorway
a
uniform
stands
in
the
doorway
a
dark
young
man
who
seems
asleep
whose
arms
hang
limp
whose
fingers
curl
in
he
comes
forward
and
stands
a
terribly
idle
figure
he
is
the
young
man
they
greet
him
his
bride
weeps
with
joy
his
aged
mother
presses
his
hands
and
weeps
and
murmurs
in
a
whisper
oh
how
changed
he
is
the
synagogue
shouts
and
cries
its
welcome
but
the
young
man
eyes
stare
and
it
would
seem
almost
that
he
is
dead
then
he
talks
his
voice
has
a
lifeless
sound
his
words
are
like
a
child
reciting
sleepily
there
is
a
gruesome
oddity
about
him
but
an
old
man
explains
they
come
back
like
that
he
says
there
is
one
who
came
back
who
shrieks
all
night
and
another
who
can
not
remember
anything
yet
how
strangely
he
talks
of
a
country
from
which
he
has
come
on
the
other
side
it
lies
hysterical
questions
arise
is
there
food
there
are
there
houses
there
is
there
milk
for
children
and
synagogues
in
which
to
pray
there
is
everything
one
desires
he
says
so
the
questions
rise
and
the
answers
come
curious
child
answers
but
why
is
he
so
pale
and
worn
if
the
country
whence
he
comes
is
so
remarkable
ah
because
he
was
lonely
all
who
are
in
this
country
are
like
him
lonely
for
the
homes
they
left
so
soon
for
their
people
all
who
are
in
the
country
whence
he
came
sit
and
remember
only
the
things
of
the
past
yes
that
is
all
one
does
in
this
marvelous
country
remember
the
things
of
the
past
over
and
over
again
they
will
go
with
him
the
miser
who
has
hidden
away
his
gold
the
widow
and
her
two
orphans
the
hungry
ones
and
despairing
ones
they
will
all
go
back
with
him
one
comes
out
of
the
theater
with
a
strange
sense
of
understanding
the
dead
have
spoken
to
one
it
is
never
to
be
forgotten
the
youth
that
was
ripped
to
pieces
in
the
trenches
reached
out
his
limp
arms
across
a
row
of
west
side
footlights
and
left
a
cry
echoing
in
one
heart
my
unlived
days
my
uneaten
bread
my
uncounted
years
they
lie
in
a
little
corner
waiting
and
no
one

the

you

see

is

frequently
that
the

al
herman

dutch
was
the
leading

of
the

needle
in
the
world
here
in
his
corner
surrounded
by
the
molding
symbols
and
slogans
of
a
dead
world
dutch
is
rounding
out
his
career
a
silenus
in
exile
his
eyes
still
bright
with
the
memory
of
midnights
long
ago
says
dutch
and
his
sigh
evokes
a
procession
of
marvelous
ghosts
tattooed
from
head
to
toe
and
capering
like
a
company
of
debonair
totem
poles
over
the
cobblestones
of
another
south
state
street
but
the
macabre
days
are
gone
the
barnum
bacchanal
of
the
nineties
lies
in
its
grave
with
a
fading
lithograph
for
a
tombstone
along
with
the
fall
of
the
russian
empire
the
collapse
of
the
fourteen
points
and
the
general
dethronement
of
reason
since
the
world
fair
the
honorable
art
of
tattooing
has
come
in
for
its
share
of
vicissitudes
oh
we
still
do
business
says
dutch
human
nature
is
slow
to
decline
and
there
are
people
who
still
realize
that
if
you
got
a
handsome
watch
what
do
you
want
to
do
to
it
engrave
it
ai
it
and
if
you
got
a
handsome
skin
what
then
tattoo
naturally
and
we
tattoo
in
seven
colors
now
where
it
used
to
be
three
and
use
electricity
do
you
think
crazy
well
you
should
see
who
i
used
to
tattoo
in
the
old
days
read
the
article
on
the
wall
as
for
being
crazy
what
do
you
say
about
the
man
who
spends
his
last
cents
to
get
into
a
baseball
game
and
gets
excited
and
throws
his
only
hat
in
the
air
and
loses
it
and
the
man
who
sits
all
day
and
all
night
with
a
fishpole
on
the
pier
and
do
catch
any
fish
yes
like
i
tell
the
judge
who
picked
us
up
one
day
in
iowa
you
know
how
they
do
sometimes
when
you
follow
the
carnival
and
he
asks
me
why
i
go
to
jail
and
if
tattooing
ai
crazy
and
i
says
give
me
three
minutes
and
i
prove
my
case
and
i
begin
with
the
romans
and
how
they
was
the
brightest
people
we
knew
and
how
they
went
in
for
tattooing
and
how
columbus
was
tattooed
and
all
the
sailors
that
was
bright
enough
to
discover
america
was
tattooed
also
then
i
say
what
if
charlie
ross
was
tattooed
would
he
be
lost
and
what
if
he
had
under
his
name
the
word
philadelphia
and
in
addition
to
that
the
date
where
he
was
born
and
his
address
and
so
on
would
he
be
lost
then
see
i
says
man
ca
be
tattooed
enough
for
his
own
good
and
the
judge
says
i
win
my
case
the
automatic
piano
plays
over
there
and
the
shooting
gallery
rifles
pop
too
insistently
for
a
moment
dutch
contemplates
a
plug
of
fresh
tobacco
then
he
resumes
this
time
a
more
intimate
tale
the
story
of
his
romance
a
weird
grotesque
amour
with
a
gaudy
obbligato
long
ago
dutch
whispers
yeh
i
knew
all
the
girls
i
tattoned
them
all
and
i
live
in
this
street
for
thirty
years
now
but
nobody
is
interested
any
more
in
what
used
to
be
how
this
street
has
become
different
ach
it
is
gone
all
gone
everything
tattooing
hangs
on
a
little
human
nature
demand
it
but
human
nature
is
dying
likewise
yeh
i
ask
you
what
would
old
barnum
say
if
he
should
come
back
and
see
me
sitting
here
me
who
was
as
good
any
day
as
capt
constantinus
i
hate
to
think
what
in
those
days
talent
counted
if
you
could
sing
or
dance
or
tattoo
it
meant
something
now
what
does
it
mean
look
at
the
dancers
and
singers
they
have
and
who
is
there
that
tattooes
any
more
it
all
gone
to
smash
the
whole
world
now
amid
the
popping
of
the
rifles
and
the
tinny
whanging
of
the
piano
dutch
draws
forth
a
final
package
he
unwraps
a
yellowed
newspaper
photographs
one
by
one
he
shuffles
them
out
and
arranges
them
on
the
broken
desk
as
if
in
some
pensive
game
of
solitaire
there
is
dutch
when
he
was
a
boy
when
he
was
a
sailor
when
he
grew
up
and
became
a
world
famous
tattooer
there
is
dutch
surrounded
by
queens
of
the
midway
dutch
with
his
arms
debonairly
thrown
round
the
shoulders
of
snake
charmers
and
other
bizarre
and
vanished
contemporaries
the
photographs
are
yellowed
they
make
a
curious
collection
they
make
the
soulless
piano
sound
a
bit
softer
a
where
are
the
snows
of
yesteryear
motif
played
on
a
fife
finally
a
modern
photo
in
a
folder
unyellowed
a
smiling
wholesome
faced
girl
here
dutch
pauses
in
his
game
of
solitaire
and
looks
in
silence
my
daughter
he
says
finally
i
sent
her
through
college
yeh
graduated
now
and

a
fine
job

different
life
and

and
she
likes

no
sir
in
this
street

only
those
who

a
long
memory
the
new
ones
should
start
somewhere
else
not
mind
you

tattooing

enough
for
anybody
but
times
have
changed
the
piano
obliges
with
the
blue
danube
a
customer
saunters
in
dutch
is
all
business
the
electricity
is
switched
on
a
blue
spark
crackles
dutch
clears
his
throat
and
slaps
the
customer
proudly
on
the
back
only
a
little
more
to
go
he
explains

over

more
ships

three
dragons

and
then
h
you
will
get

job
any
day
in
any
side
show
i
can
guarantee
you
that
heinie
grins
hopefully
the
thing
in
the
dark
it
has
the
usual
huron
street
ending
emergency
case
psychopathic
hospital
dunning
but
the
landlady
talked
to
the
police
sergeant
the
landlady
was
curious
she
wanted
the
police
sergeant
to
tell
her
something
and
the
police
sergeant
resting
his
chin
on
his
elbow
leaned
forward
on
his
high
stool
and
peered
through
the
partition
window
at
the
landlady
and
said
nothing
or
rather
he
said
do
know
that
the
way
with
people
sometimes
they
get
afraid
this
man
came
to
balmer
in
huron
street
when
it
was
spring
he
was
a
short
stocky
man
with
a
leathery
face
and
little
eyes
he
identified
himself
as
joseph
crawford
offered
to
pay
a
week
for
a
by
room
on
the
third
floor
at
the
rear
end
of
the
long
gloomy
hallway
and
arrived
the
next
day
at
balmer
faded
tenement
with
an
equally
faded
trunk
nothing
happened
but
when
balmer
entered
the
room
the
following
morning
to
straighten
it
up
she
found
several
innovations
there
were
four
kerosene
lamps
in
the
room
they
stood
on
small
rickety
tables
one
in
each
corner
and
there
was
a
new
electric
light
bulb
in
the
central
fixture
balmer
took
note
of
these
things
with
a
professional
eye
but
said
nothing
idiosyncrasies
are
to
be
expected
of
the
amputated
folk
who
seek
out
lonely
tenement
bedrooms
for
a
home
a
week
later
however
balmer
spoke
to
the
man
you
burn
your
light
all
night
said
balmer
and
while
i
have
no
objection
to
that
still
it
runs
up
the
electric
light
bill
the
man
agreed
that
this
was
true
and
answered
that
he
would
pay
extra
each
week
for
the
privilege
of
continuing
to
burn
the
electric
light
all
night
nothing
happened
yet
balmer
when
she
had
time
for
such
things
as
contemplation
grew
curious
about
the
man
in
the
back
room
in
fact
she
transferred
her
curiosity
from
the
japanese
female
impersonator
on
the
second
floor
and
the
beautiful
and
remarkably
gowned
woman
on
the
first
floor
to
this
man
who
kept
four
kerosene
lamps
and
an
electric
bulb
burning
all
night
on
the
third
floor
for
some
time
balmer
was
worried
over
the
thought
that
this
man
was
probably
an
experimenter
he
probably
fussed
around
with
things
as
an
old
crank
does
sometimes
and
he
would
end
by
burning
down
the
house
or
blowing
it
up
accidentally
but
balmer
fears
were
removed
one
evening
when
she
happened
to
look
down
the
gloomy
hallway
and
notice
that
this
man
door
was
open
a
gay
festive
illumination
streamed
out
of
the
opened
doorway
and
balmer
paid
a
social
call
she
found
her
roomer
sitting
in
a
chair
reading
around
him
blazed
four
large
kerosene
lamps
but
there
was
nothing
else
to
notice
his
eyes
were
probably
bad
and
balmer
after
exchanging
a
few
words
on
the
subject
of
towels
transportation
and
the
weather
said
but
always
after
that
balmer
noticed
that
the
door
remained
open
open
doors
are
frequent
in
people
grow
lonely
and
leave
the
doors
of
their
cubby
holes
open
there
is
nothing
odd
about
that
yet
one
evening
while
balmer
stood
gossiping
with
this
man
in
the
doorway
she
noticed
something
about
him
that
disturbed
her
she
had
noticed
it
first
when
she
looked
in
the
room
before
saying
hello
crawford
was
sitting
facing
the
portieres
that
covered
the
folding
doors
that
partitioned
the
room
the
portieres
were
a
very
clever
ruse
of
balmer
behind
them
were
screwed
hooks
and
these
hooks
functioned
as
a
balmer
noticed
that
crawford
as
she
talked
kept
staring
at
the
portieres
and
watching
them
and
that
he
seemed
very
nervous
the
next
morning
when
she
was
straightening
up
the
room
balmer
looked
behind
the
portières
an
old
straw
hat
an
old
coat
a
few
worn
shirts
hung
from
the
hooks
there
was
nothing
else
but
the
and
this
was
not
only
locked
but
nailed
up
when
two
months
had
passed
balmer
had
made
a
discovery
it
had
to
do
with
the
four
kerosene
lamps
and
the
extra
large
electric
bulb
and
the
portières
but
it
was
an
irritating
discovery
since
it
made
everything
more
mysterious
than
ever
in
the
landlady
mind
she
had
caught
many
glimpses
of
this
man
in
the
back
room
when
he
looking
of
evenings
he
sat
with
his
door
opened
and
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
portières
he
would
sit
like
that
for
hours
and
his
leathery
face
would
become
gray
his
little
eyes
would
widen
and
his
body
would
hunch
up
as
if
he
were
stiffening
but
nothing
happened
finally
however
balmer
began
to
talk
she
did
like
this
man
crawford
it
made
her
nervous
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
in
his
lighted
room
sitting
hour
after
hour
staring
at
the
portières
as
if
there
was
something
behind
them
when
there
was
nothing
behind
them
except
an
old
hat
and
coat
and
shirt
she
looked
every
morning
but
he
paid
his
rent
regularly
he
left
in
the
morning
regularly
and
always
returned
at
eight
he
was
an
ideal
roomer
except
that
there
never
is
an
ideal
roomer
but
balmer
could
stand
his
lights
and
his
watching
the
portières
it
frightened
her
screams
sometimes
sound
in
a
one
night
it
was
after
midnight
balmer
woke
up
the
darkened
house
seemed
filled
with
noises
a
man
was
screaming
balmer
got
dressed
and
called
the
janitor
there
was
no
doubt
in
her
mind
where
the
noises
came
from
some
of
the
roomers
were
awake
and
looking
sleepily
and
frightenedly
out
of
their
doorways
balmer
and
the
janitor
hurried
to
the
back
room
on
the
third
floor
it
was
crawford
screaming
his
door
was
closed
but
it
opened
when
the
janitor
turned
the
knob
crawford
was
standing
in
front
of
the
portières
in
the
lighted
room
and
screaming
his
arms
as
if
overcoming
some
awful
resistance
shot
out
and
his
hands
seized
the
portières
with
the
amazing
screams
still
coming
from
his
throat
crawford
tore
crazily
at
the
portières
until
they
ripped
from
the
rod
above
the
they
came
down
and
the
man
fell
with
them
over
him
hanging
on
the
hooks
were
revealed
an
old
straw
hat
an
old
coat
and
a
worn
shirt
you
see
said
balmer
to
the
police
sergeant
he
was
afraid
of
something
and
he
could
stand
the
dark
and
the
portières
always
frightened
him
but
the
doctor
was
able
to
do
anything
with
him
the
doctor
says
there
was
some
secret
about
it
and
that
crawford
went
crazy
because
of
this
secret
the
only
thing
they
found
out
about
him
was
that
he
used
to
be
a
sailor
an
old
audience
speaks
tired
madam
that
is
nothing
remarkable
so
are
we
whose
faces
you
see
from
across
the
footlights
faces
like
rows
of
wilted
plants
in
the
gloom
of
this
decrepit
theater
we
are
all
very
tired
it
is
saturday
afternoon
for
a
little
while
yesterday
there
was
spring
in
the
streets
but
now
it
has
grown
cold
again
the
wind
blows
the
buildings
wear
a
bald
cheerless
look
what
are
we
tired
about
god
knows
perhaps
because
winter
is
so
long
in
passing
or
perhaps
because
spring
will
be
so
long
in
passing
tired
of
waiting
for
tomorrow
so
you
dance
for
us
we
have
paid
cents
each
to
see
the
show
this
abominable
orchestra
is
out
of
tune
the
fiddles
scrape
the
piano
makes
clattering
sounds
and
you
madam
are
tired
the
gay
purple
tights
the
gilded
bodice
the
sultana
toque
or
whatever
it
is
do
not
deceive
us
your
legs
madam
are
not
as
shapely
as
they
were
once
and
your
body
ah
bodies
grow
old
yes
we
are
not
deceived
madam
you
have
come
to
us
last
there
were
others
before
us
others
reaching
far
back
to
whom
you
gave
your
youth
others
for
whom
you
danced
when
your
legs
were
perhaps
like
two
spring
mornings
and
when
your
body
was
perhaps
like
a
pretty
laugh
here
are
the
tired
ones
from
the
south
clark
and
south
state
streets
the
kinds
of
faces
that
the
smart
movie
directors
hire
as
types
for
the
underworld
scenes
or
the
slum
scenes
it
is
saturday
afternoon
and
we
walked
up
and
down
the
street
looking
at
the
lithographs
outside
the
decrepit
theater
fronts
and
when
it
got
too
cold
to
walk
any
farther
we
dropped
in
forking
out
four
bits
for
the
privilege
and
we
expect
nothing
madam
there
will
be
no
great
music
for
us
and
what
scenery
there
is
behind
the
footlights
will
be
faded
and
patched
the
jokes
will
be
things
that
make
no
one
laugh
and
the
dancers
madam
will
be
like
you
tired
dancers
whose
legs
flop
whose
bodies
bounce
while
the
abominable
orchestra
plays
but
it
is
warm
where
we
sit
we
half
shut
our
eyes
and
tired
little
dreams
come
to
us
and
you
madam
going
wearily
through
your
steps
are
the
joy
of
life
your
hoarse
voice
singing
indecipherable
words
about
dearie
and
honey
and
my
jazz
baby
your
sagging
shoulders
layered
with
powder
and
jerking
to
the
music
the
rigid
lifeless
grin
of
your
cruelly
painted
lips
these
things
and
the
torn
smeared
ballroom
interior
these
are
the
joy
of
life
tired
little
dreams
worth
almost
the
four
bits
do
you
remember
other
audiences
madam
as
we
remember
other
dancers
do
you
recall
the
gay
dark
glow
of
ornate
auditoriums
and
do
you
remember
when
you
were
young
and
there
were
many
tomorrows
as
we
do
oh
dearie
dearie
how
mah
heart
grows
weary
waitin
for
mah
baby
for
to
come
back
home
very
good
madam
although
the
voice
is
a
bit
cracked
now
dance
lumber
across
the
stage
in
your
purple
tights
wiggle
around
in
your
sultana
toque
that
the
baby
and
kick
your
legs
at
us
as
you
exit
ah
what
a
kick
but
never
mind
it
is
quite
good
enough
for
us
and
it
reminds
us
we
applaud
does
the
noise
sound
ghastly
what
is
it
we
applaud
god
knows
but
applause
is
a
habit
one
applauds
in
a
theater
how
does
it
sound
in
the
wings
to
you
madam
our
applause
rather
meaningless
eh
and
not
interesting
at
all
ah
we
forgive
you
for
that
for
not
feeling
a
great
thrill
at
our
applause
nevertheless
it
is
a
rather
piquant
thing
our
applause
considering
how
cold
it
is
outside
how
long
winter
is
in
passing
considering
how
cheerless
the
buildings
look
put
on
the
red
ball
gown
and
come
out
and
crack
jokes
with
the
juvenile
lead
greetings
madam
how
marvelous
you
look
in
this
ball
gown
ah
indeed
you
were
walking
down
the
street
the
other
day
and
chanced
to
meet
hm
we
heard
that
joke
but
we
laugh
again
matrimony
i
tell
you
what
marriage
is
a
lottery
yes
we
heard
that
one
too
accept
our
laughter
nevertheless
your
jokes
madam
are
neither
young
nor
refined
but
neither
are
we
and
your
wit
is
somewhat
coarse
and
pointless
but
so
are
we
and
your
voice
is
a
trifle
tired
and
cracked
and
loud
but
so
is
our
laughter
we
are
even
quite
even
madam
if
you
were
better
once
so
were
we
if
you
remember
sweeter
laughter
why
we
remember
more
charming
jests
go
on
dolores
our
lady
of
jokes
you
worth
the
four
bits
now
the
street
seems
a
bit
colder
because
it
was
warmer
in
the
theater
where
do
we
go
from
here
up
and
down
up
and
down
the
old
street
a
very
pleasant
afternoon
spent
in
laughter
and
applause
once
there
was
booze
for
a
nickel
and
a
dime
but
it
was
found
necessary
to
improve
the
morals
of
the
nation
no
booze
today
that
is
quite
a
brave
photograph
of
you
outside
the
theater
madam
the
dancing
venus
if
we
had
tears
we
would
shed
them
the
dancing
venus
indeed
we
smile
as
you
smiled
yourself
when
you
saw
it
for
the
first
time
but
master
francois
villon
sang
it
all
long
ago
yesterdays
yesterdays
here
is
a
street
of
yesterdays
and
we
the
tired
ones
the
ones
the
beaten
ones
we
walk
up
and
down
the
cold
street
peering
at
the
cheerless
buildings
life
takes
a
long
time
to
pass
but
without
changing
our
bitter
brutal
faces
we
bow
this
afternoon
madam
to
the
memory
of
you
we
paid
four
bits
to
see
you
our
lady
of
jokes
and
in
this
cold
sunless
street
we
grin
we
smirk
we
leer
a
salutation
to
your
photograph
and
the
phrase
beneath
it
that
laughs
mockingly
back
at
us
oh
dancing
venus
mishkin
minyon
we
were
discussing
vacations
and
sammy
who
is
eleven
years
old
going
on
twelve
listened
nervously
to
his
father
finally
sammy
spoke
up
i
wo
go
he
bristled
no
i
wo
if
i
got
ta
tell
the
conductor
under
five
i
ai
going
sammy
father
coughed
with
some
embarrassment
sha
said
feodor
mishkin
removing
his
attention
from
the
bowl
of
fruit
i
see
it
takes
more
than
naturalization
papers
to
change
a
from
kremetchuk
and
he
fastened
a
humorous
eye
upon
sammy
father
it
like
this
continued
the
falstaffian
one
from
roosevelt
road
in
russia
where
my
friend
here
hershela
comes
from
that
is
in
russia
of
the
good
old
days
where
there
were
pogroms
and
ghettos
and
ah
i
grow
homesick
for
that
old
russia
sometimes
the
jews
were
not
always
so
honest
as
they
might
be
do
interrupt
me
hershela
my
friend
here
i
want
to
tell
a
story
to
is
a
journalist
and
he
will
understand
i
am
no
if
i
explain
how
it
is
that
you
want
your
son
sammy
to
tell
the
conductor
he
is
under
five
turning
to
me
mishkin
grinned
and
proceeded
the
jews
as
you
know
are
great
travelers
he
said
they
have
traveled
more
than
all
the
other
peoples
put
together
and
yet
they
do
like
to
pay
car
fare
in
russia
particular
i
can
remember
my
father
who
was
a
good
rabbi
and
a
holy
man
yes
but
when
it
came
time
to
ride
on
the
train
from
one
city
to
another
he
would
fold
up
his
long
beard
and
crawl
under
the
seat
it
was
only
on
such
an
occasion
that
my
father
would
talk
to
a
woman
he
would
actually
rather
cut
off
his
right
hand
than
talk
to
a
woman
in
public
that
he
did
know
this
was
because
rabbi
mishkin
my
father
was
a
holy
man
but
he
was
not
above
asking
a
woman
to
spread
out
her
skirts
so
that
the
inspector
coming
through
the
train
could
see
him
under
the
seat
of
course
you
had
to
pay
the
conductors
but
a
ruble
was
enough
not
ten
or
twenty
rubles
like
the
fare
called
for
and
the
conductors
were
always
glad
to
have
jews
ride
on
their
train
because
it
meant
a
private
revenue
for
them
i
remember
that
the
conductors
on
the
line
running
through
kremetchuk
had
learned
a
few
words
of
yiddish
for
instance
when
the
train
would
stop
at
a
station
the
conductor
would
walk
up
and
down
the
platform
and
cry
out
a
few
times
this
meant
that
the
inspector
was
on
the
train
and
you
could
jump
on
and
hide
under
the
seats
or
if
the
inspector
was
on
the
train
the
conductor
would
walk
up
and
down
and
yell
a
few
times
this
is
a
hebrew
word
that
means
evil
angel
and
it
was
the
signal
for
nothing
doing
the
story
i
remember
is
on
a
train
going
but
of
kiev
said
mishkin
years
ago
it
was
i
was
sitting
in
the
train
reading
some
russian
papers
when
i
heard
three
old
jews
talking
they
had
long
white
beards
and
there
were
marks
on
their
foreheads
from
where
they
laid
twillum
yes
i
saw
that
they
were
holy
men
and
pretty
soon
i
heard
that
they
were
upset
about
something
you
know
what
i
tell
you
for
a
religious
jew
in
the
old
country
to
pass
an
evening
without
a
minyon
is
a
sin
a
minyon
is
a
prayer
that
is
said
at
evening
and
to
make
a
minyon
there
must
be
ten
jews
and
they
must
stand
up
when
they
pray
of
course
if
you
are
somewhere
where
there
are
no
ten
jews
then
maybe
all
right
to
say
it
with
three
or
four
jews
only
so
these
holy
men
on
the
train
were
arguing
if
they
should
have
a
minyon
or
not
because
there
were
only
three
of
them
but
finally
they
decided
after
a
theological
discussion
that
it
would
be
all
right
to
have
the
minyon
it
was
dark
already
and
the
train
was
going
fast
and
the
three
jews
stood
up
in
their
place
at
the
end
of
the
car
and
began
the
prayer
and
pretty
soon
i
began
to
hear
voices
yes
from
under
nearly
every
seat
voices
praying
a
that
filled
the
car
i
did
know
what
to
make
of
it
for
a
few
minutes
but
then
i
remembered
of
course
the
car
was
full
of
rabbis
or
at
least
holy
men
and
they
were
as
usual
riding
with
their
beards
folded
up
under
the
seats
so
smiled
mishkin
the
prayer
continued
and
some
of
the
passengers
who
were
listening
began
to
smile
you
can
imagine
but
the
three
jews
paid
no
attention
they
went
on
with
the
minyon
and
now
listen
now
comes
the
whole
story
you
will
laugh
but
it
is
true
i
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
the
prayer
like
i
told
you
must
be
said
standing
up
at
least
it
is
a
sin
to
say
the
last
part
of
the
prayer
particularly
the
without
standing
up
so
as
the
prayer
came
towards
its
finish
imagine
what
happened
from
under
a
dozen
seats
began
to
appear
old
jews
with
white
beards
they
crawled
out
and
without
brushing
themselves
off
stood
up
and
when
the
finally
came
there
were
eleven
jews
standing
up
in
a
group
and
praying
under
the
seats
it
was
completely
vacant
and
just
at
this
moment
when
the
filled
the
car
who
should
come
through
but
the
inspector
in
his
uniform
with
his
lantern
when
he
saw
this
whole
car
full
of
passengers
he
had
seen
before
he
stopped
in
surprise
and
the
finish
of
it
was
that
they
all
had
to
pay
their
fare
extra
fare
too
it
is
a
nice
story
do
you
think
hershela
mishkin
laughed
it
shows
a
lot
of
things
but
principally
it
shows
that
a
holy
man
is
a
holy
man
first
and
that
he
will
sacrifice
himself
to
an
inquisition
in
madrid
or
a
train
inspector
in
kiev
for
the
simple
sake
of
saying
his
just
as
he
believed
it
should
be
said
and
just
as
he
wants
to
say
it
sammy
father
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
do
see
how
what
you
say
has
anything
to
do
with
what
my
son
said
he
demurred
sammy
looks
user
more
than
five
and
what
harm
is
there
in
saving
if
sammy
interrupted
with
a
wail
i
wo
go
he
cried
no
if
i
got
ta
tell
the
conductor
i
under
five
i
better
stay
home
i
do
wan
na
go
he
know
i
going
on
twelve
all
right
all
right
sighed
sammy
father
but
you
see
he
added
turning
to
mishkin
it
ai
on
account
of
wanting
to
have
a
minyon
that
my
son
has
such
high
ideas
sociable
gamblers
yes
it
do
interfere
with
their
game
said
bill
cochran
the
deputy
sheriff
from
tom
freeman
office
he
cut
himself
a
slice
of
chewing
tobacco
and
glanced
meditatively
out
of
the
window
of
the
dearborn
street
bastile
whereat
he
repeated
with
gentle
emphasis
it
do
a
long
rain
was
leaning
against
the
walls
of
the
county
jail
a
dismal
yellowish
gloom
drifted
up
and
down
the
street
deputy
cochran
with
an
effort
detached
his
eye
from
the
lugubrious
scene
of
the
rain
and
the
and
spoke
up
brightly
but
at
that
said
he
i
do
think
their
being
doomed
for
to
hang
can
be
held
entirely
responsible
for
their
losing
you
see
i
made
quite
a
study
of
the
game
o
rhummy
not
to
mention
pinochle
and
other
such
games
of
chance
and
if
i
do
say
so
myself
i
doubt
there
the
man
in
chicago
doomed
for
to
hang
or
otherwise
who
would
find
me
an
easy
mark
still
as
i
say
in
the
case
of
these
gentlemen
who
you
refer
to
to
wit
the
doomed
men
as
i
have
acted
as
death
watch
for
it
do
interfere
with
their
game
there
no
denying
that
now
the
rain
chattered
darkly
on
the
grated
windows
of
the
dearborn
street
bastile
and
deputy
cochran
tilted
back
in
his
chair
and
thought
pensively
and
in
silence
of
life
and
death
and
high
low
jack
and
the
game
they
pick
me
out
for
the
death
watch
on
account
i
have
a
way
with
doomed
men
he
remarked
at
last
his
voice
modestly
some
of
the
deputies
is
inclined
to
get
a
bit
sad
you
know
or
to
let
their
nerves
go
away
with
them
but
me
i
feel
as
the
best
thing
to
do
in
the
crisis
to
which
i
refer
is
to
make
the
best
of
it
so
when
i
sit
in
on
the
death
watch
i
faces
myself
with
the
truth
i
says
to
myself
right
away
this
young
feller
here
is
to
be
hanged
by
the
neck
until
dead
in
a
few
hours
which
being
the
case
there
no
use
wasting
any
more
time
or
thought
on
the
matter
so
after
this
i
usually
says
to
the
young
feller
under
observation
by
the
death
watch
is
there
anything
in
particular
as
you
like
to
discuss
i
was
a
bit
thick
with
the
abyssinian
prince
grover
redding
you
recall
the
man
spent
the
whole
time
we
were
with
him
praying
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
singing
hymns
not
that
i
begrudged
the
fellow
this
privilege
but
if
you
ever
heard
a
man
who
going
to
be
hanged
in
a
few
hours
try
to
pass
the
time
in
continual
prayers
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
you
understand
our
predicament
then
there
was
antonio
lopez
i
was
death
watch
on
him
and
a
difficult
task
that
was
the
lad
kept
up
his
pretense
that
he
fancied
himself
a
rooster
to
the
very
end
he
crouched
on
the
chair
on
his
feet
and
flapped
his
elbows
like
as
they
were
wings
and
emitted
rooster
calls
all
night
long
i
tried
to
dissuade
him
and
offered
to
play
him
any
game
he
wished
for
any
stake
but
the
only
way
he
could
reconcile
himself
to
the
approaching
fatal
dawn
was
to
crow
like
a
rooster
i
thought
to
cheer
him
up
toward
the
end
by
congratulating
him
on
his
excellent
imitations
as
i
bore
him
no
ill
will
despite
he
gave
us
all
a
terrible
headache
before
the
death
march
took
him
away
now
the
rain
dropped
in
long
quick
lines
outside
the
window
and
the
pavements
below
glowed
like
dark
mirrors
deputy
cochran
however
had
become
oblivious
to
the
scene
his
eyes
withdrew
themselves
from
the
and
casually
traced
themselves
over
the
memories
his
calling
had
left
him
there
was
blacky
weed
some
years
ago
he
went
on
and
viana
the
choir
boy
and
to
come
down
to
more
recent
incidents
harry
ward
the
wolf
i
played
cards
with
them
all
and
can
truthfully
say
i
won
most
of
the
games
played
to
which
i
refer
with
the
exception
of
those
played
with
the
wolf
hanged
recently
if
you
recall
i
will
say
that
the
chief
trouble
with
the
doomed
men
as
i
have
engaged
in
games
of
chance
with
is
their
inability
to
concentrate
now
cards
to
be
properly
played
requires
above
all
a
gift
of
the
ability
to
concentrate
recognizing
this
i
have
always
refused
to
play
for
money
with
the
doomed
as
i
have
been
watch
over
saying
to
them
when
they
pressed
the
matter
let
make
it
just
a
sociable
game
for
the
fun
in
it
rather
than
play
for
money
there
are
others
not
so
scrupulous
hinted
deputy
cochran
take
for
instance
the
example
of
the
newspaper
man
as
was
eddie
brislane
friend
and
comforter
he
was
with
him
in
the
cell
most
of
the
time
before
the
hanging
and
two
days
before
the
aforesaid
he
paid
brislane
for
a
story
to
be
printed
exclusively
in
his
paper
then
this
newspaper
man
which
i
consider
unethical
under
the
circumstances
played
brislane
poker
and
what
with
the
doomed
man
lack
of
concentration
and
his
inability
to
take
advantage
of
the
turns
of
the
game
therefore
this
newspaper
man
won
back
his
and
some
few
dollars
besides
as
for
me
i
doubt
whether
all
my
card
playing
with
these
doomed
men
successful
though
it
has
been
has
ever
brought
me
as
much
as
a
half
dollar
no
as
i
said
sociability
is
the
object
of
these
games
and
all
i
aim
for
is
to
put
the
doomed
man
at
his
ease
for
the
time
being
deputy
cochian
suddenly
smiled
although
before
an
impersonal
air
had
marked
his
discourse
there
was
the
wolf
as
i
mentioned
he
continued
a
feller
and
a
sinner
to
the
end
but
he
was
the
best
rhummy
player
as
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
matching
skill
with
yes
sir
it
was
his
ability
for
to
concentrate
as
i
said
that
is
the
prime
ability
necessary
and
the
wolf
had
more
concentration
than
any
one
i
have
matched
skill
with
in
or
out
of
the
jail
that
was
an
interesting
evening
we
spent
on
the
death
watch
for
the
wolf
he
regaled
us
for
an
hour
or
so
telling
us
how
he
used
to
steal
motor
cars
yes
sir
whenever
the
wolf
wanted
a
new
car
he
just
went
out
and
took
it
a
feller
as
i
say
then
he
asked
if
i
would
mind
playing
him
a
game
of
rhummy
and
i
answered
harry
as
you
are
aware
i
am
here
to
oblige
so
we
got
out
the
deck
and
harry
insisted
upon
gambling
it
a
dollar
a
hand
he
said
but
i
would
listen
to
none
of
that
we
played
eight
games
in
all
and
he
beat
me
six
of
them
perhaps
i
was
not
at
my
best
that
night
but
i
never
played
against
such
a
feller
he
took
a
positive
joy
in
winning
his
games
and
on
the
whole
acted
like
a
bum
winner
making
the
most
of
his
unusual
good
luck
i
hold
no
grudge
for
that
however
but
i
feel
that
if
we
could
have
continued
the
play
some
other
time
i
easily
have
finished
him
off
now
the
sun
was
slowly
recovering
its
place
and
the
rain
had
become
a
light
mist
deputy
cochran
seemed
to
regard
this
as
a
signal
for
a
conclusion
summing
the
matter
all
up
pro
and
con
he
offered
it
do
interfere
with
their
game
a
lot
but
i
lay
this
to
the
fact
that
they
all
fancy
they
going
to
be
reprieved
and
they
keep
waiting
and
listening
for
an
announcement
which
will
save
them
from
the
gallows
i
known
some
of
them
to
lead
a
deuce
thinking
it
was
an
ace
and
vice
versa
but
at
that
i
can
fully
recommend
a
good
sociable
game
of
cards
as
the
best
way
for
a
doomed
man
to
pass
the
few
hours
before
the
arrival
of
the
fatal
moment
ripples
it
rains
people
carry
umbrellas
a
great
financier
has
promised
me
an
interview
the
windows
of
his
club
look
out
on
a
thousand
umbrellas
they
bob
along
like
drunken
beetles
once
in
a
blue
moon
one
becomes
aware
of
people
usually
the
crowds
and
their
endless
faces
are
a
background
they
circle
around
one
the
way
ripples
circle
around
a
stone
that
has
fallen
into
the
water
the
torments
elation
of
others
the
ambitions
defeats
of
others
the
bedlam
of
others
who
the
piano
a
cornet
probably
or
a
ukulele
what
creates
in
the
plunge
from
youth
to
age
here
then
under
the
umbrellas
outside
the
great
financier
club
are
people
one
must
marvel
they
pass
one
another
without
so
much
as
a
glance
to
each
of
them
all
the
others
the
bedlam
of
others
are
ripples
emanating
from
themselves
the
great
quests
and
struggles
going
on
and
the
million
agonies
and
tumults
beating
in
the
veins
of
the
world
ripples
yes
vague
and
vaguer
ripples
which
surround
the
fact
that
one
is
going
to
buy
a
pair
of
suspenders
which
circle
the
fact
that
one
is
invited
out
for
dinner
this
evening
ah
the
smug
and
oblivious
ones
under
umbrellas
it
rains
but
the
umbrellas
keep
off
the
rain
the
world
pours
its
distinctions
and
elations
over
their
souls
but
other
umbrellas
invisible
keep
off
distractions
and
elations
and
each
of
them
scurrying
along
outside
the
window
of
the
great
financier
club
is
an
omniscient
world
center
to
himself
the
great
play
was
written
around
him
a
blur
of
disasters
and
ecstasies
a
sort
of
vast
and
inarticulate
greek
chorus
mumbling
an
obbligato
to
the
leitmotif
which
is
at
the
moment
the
purchase
of
a
pair
of
suspenders
or
a
dinner
invitation
for
the
evening
none
so
small
under
these
umbrellas
outside
the
window
but
fancies
himself
the
center
of
the
cosmos
none
so
stupid
but
regards
himself
as
the
oracle
of
the
times
and
they
scurry
along
without
a
glance
at
one
another
each
innately
convinced
that
his
ideas
his
prejudices
his
ambitions
his
tastes
are
the
great
standard
the
normal
criterion
puritan
paranoiac
sybarite
katatoniac
hardhead
dreamer
coward
desperado
beaten
ones
striving
ones
successful
ones
all
flaunt
their
umbrellas
in
the
rain
all
unfurl
their
invisible
umbrellas
to
the
world
let
it
rain
let
it
rain
calamities
and
ecstasies
tipped
with
fire
and
roaring
with
thunder
nothing
can
disturb
the
terrible
preoccupation
of
the
plunge
from
youth
to
age
the
pavements
gleam
like
dark
mirrors
the
office
window
lights
chatter
in
the
gloom
an
umbrella
pauses
the
great
financier
is
giving
directions
to
his
chauffeur
the
directions
given
the
great
financier
stands
in
the
rain
for
a
moment
his
eyes
look
up
and
down
the
street
what
does
he
see
ripples
vague
and
vaguer
ripples
that
mark
his
passage
from
the
limousine
into
the
club
he
is
wet
a
servant
helps
him
remove
his
coat
then
he
comes
to
the
window
and
sinks
into
a
leather
chair
and
stares
at
the
rain
and
the
umbrellas
outside
the
great
financier
has
been
abroad
his
highly
specialized
mind
has
been
poking
among
columns
of
figures
columns
of
reports
he
desired
to
find
out
if
possible
what
conditions
abroad
were
for
six
months
the
great
financier
closeted
himself
daily
with
other
great
financiers
and
talked
and
talked
and
discussed
and
talked
but
he
says
nothing
it
is
curious
the
whole
world
and
all
its
marvelous
distractions
seem
to
have
resolved
themselves
into
the
curt
sentence
it
rains
and
somehow
the
great
financier
faculty
for
the
glib
manipulation
of
platitudes
which
has
earned
him
a
reputation
as
a
powerful
economist
seems
for
the
moment
to
have
abandoned
him
his
eyes
remind
one
of
a
boy
standing
on
tiptoe
and
staring
over
a
fence
at
a
baseball
game
the
conversation
finally
begins
it
runs
something
like
this
it
is
the
great
financier
talking
europe
oh
yes
quite
a
mess
things
will
pick
up
however
a
long
pause
the
umbrellas
bob
along
one
two
three
four
five
the
financier
counts
up
to
thirty
then
he
rubs
his
hands
together
as
if
he
were
taking
charge
of
a
situation
freshly
arisen
at
a
board
of
directors
meeting
and
says
in
a
jovial
voice
where
were
we
oh
yes
the
european
situation
well
now
what
do
you
want
to
know
in
particular
ah
this
great
financier
has
columns
of
figures
columns
of
reports
and
columns
of
phrases
in
his
head
press
a
button
and
they
will
pop
out
have
a
cigar
the
financier
asks
cigars
are
lighted
a
rotten
day
he
says
does
look
as
if
it
will
clear
up
either
does
it
then
he
says
i
guess
this
is
an
off
day
for
me
no
energy
at
all
i
swear
i
ca
think
of
a
thing
to
tell
you
about
the
european
situation
he
sits
smoking
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
scene
outside
the
window
his
eyes
seem
to
be
searching
as
if
for
meanings
that
withhold
themselves
yet
obviously
there
is
no
thought
in
his
head
a
mood
has
wormed
its
way
through
the
columns
of
figures
columns
of
reports
and
taken
possession
of
him
this
is
bad
for
a
financier
it
is
obvious
that
the
umbrellas
outside
are
for
the
moment
something
other
than
ripples
that
the
great
play
of
life
outside
is
something
other
than
an
inarticulate
greek
chorus
mumbled
as
an
obbligato
for
him
alone
the
great
financier
is
aware
of
something
of
what
he
shakes
his
head
as
if
to
question
himself
of
nothing
he
can
tell
of
the
fact
that
a
great
financier
is
an
atom
like
other
atoms
dancing
in
a
chaos
of
atoms
of
the
fact
that
each
of
the
umbrellas
crawling
past
under
his
window
is
as
important
as
himself
the
great
financier
ego
is
taking
a
rest
and
dreams
naked
of
words
crowd
in
to
distract
him
we
have
in
europe
a
peculiar
situation
he
says
england
and
france
although
hitched
to
the
same
wagon
pull
in
different
directions
england
must
build
up
her
trade
france
must
build
up
her
morale
these
involve
different
efforts
to
build
up
her
trade
england
must
germany
to
build
up
her
morale
france
must
see
that
germany
is
not
and
that
it
remains
forever
a
beaten
enemy
the
great
financier
looks
at
his
watch
suddenly
by
jove
he
says
by
jove
he
has
to
go
he
is
sorry
the
interview
was
a
failure
but
a
rotten
day
for
thinking
back
into
his
raincoat
a
limousine
has
drawn
up
a
servant
helps
him
to
dress
in
a
moment
another
umbrella
has
joined
the
crawl
of
umbrellas
over
the
pavement
it
rains
and
a
great
financier
is
riding
home
to
dinner
pitzela
son
his
name
said
feodor
mishkin
hm
always
you
want
names
is
life
a
matter
of
names
and
addresses
or
is
it
something
else
but
the
story
would
be
better
feodor
with
names
in
it
the
rotund
and
omniscient
journalist
from
the
west
side
muttered
to
himself
in
russian
better
he
repeated
and
why
better
if
i
tell
you
his
name
is
yankel
or
berella
or
chaim
duvit
do
you
know
any
more
than
if
i
tell
you
his
name
is
pitzela
no
we
will
drop
the
matter
i
will
call
him
chaim
yankel
you
will
call
him
chaim
yankel
and
what
for
his
name
is
pitzela
and
not
chaim
yankel
thanks
you
can
go
anywhere
on
maxwell
street
and
ask
anybody
you
meet
do
they
know
pitzela
and
they
will
say
we
know
pitzela
we
know
pitzela
all
right
so
what
is
there
to
be
gained
by
calling
him
chaim
yankel
nothing
feodor
it
was
a
mistake
even
to
think
of
it
it
was
well
as
i
was
telling
you
before
you
began
this
interruption
about
names
he
is
exactly
years
old
can
you
imagine
a
man
years
old
a
man
years
old
is
an
unusual
thing
is
it
it
is
feodor
but
i
once
knew
a
man
years
old
ha
and
what
kind
of
a
man
was

his
teeth

he
drink
like
a
fish

was
an
old
man
and
very
sad

see
he
was
sad
so
what
has
he
to
do
with
pitzela
nothing
pitzela
laughs
all
day
long
and
he
dances
jigs
and
he
cracks
nuts
with
his
teeth
mind

old
cracks
nuts
with
his
teeth

you
imagine
such
a
thing
no
feodor
it
is
amazing
amazing
why
amazing
everything
that
happens
different
from
what
you
know
is
amazing
to
you
you
are
very
naïve
you
know
what
naïve
means
it
is
french
i
know
what
naïve
means
feodor
go
on
about
pitzela
naïve
means
to
be
childish
late
in
life
in
a
way
you
are
like
pitzela
despite
the
difference
in
your
ages
he
is
naïve
you
know
what
he
wants
what
this
pitzela
wants
to
show
everybody
how
young
he
is
that
his
central
ambition
he
do
talk
english
much
but
when
you
ask
him
how
do
you
feel
today
he
says
to
you
right
back
me
i
full
o
pep
then
if
you
ask
him
old
are
you
pitzela
he
says
what
does
it
matter
how
old
i
am
i
am
just
beginning
to
enjoy
myself
and
when
you
talk
about
my
dying
do
laugh
too
much
because
you
know
i
will
attend
all
your
funerals
when
i
am
years
old
i
will
be
burying
your
grandchildren
and
he
will
laugh
do
you
like
the
story
yes
feodor
but
it
is
long
enough
i
will
have
to
go
out
and
see
pitzela
and
describe
him
and
that
will
make
the
story
long
enough
it
is
long
enough
what
do
you
mean
i
just
begun
the
story
about
pitzela
at
all
so
why
should
you
go
see
pitzela
but
i
thought
it
was
about
pitzela
you
thought
hm
well
you
see
what
good
it
does
you
to
think
for
according
to
your
thinking
the
story
is
already
finished
whereas
according
to
me
the
story
is
only
just
beginning
but
you
said
it
was
about
pitzela
feodor
so
i
believed
you
i
said
nothing
of
the
sort
i
merely
asked
you
if
you
knew
pitzela
the
story
is
entirely
about
pitzela
son
aha
this
pitzela
has
a
son
that
interesting
of
course
it
is
pitzela
son
is

maxwell
street
do
they
know
pitzela
son
and
they
will
tell
you
we
know
pitzela
son
hm
it
a
scandal
the
editor
feodor
forbids
me
to
write
about
scandals
so
be
careful
this
scandal
is
one
you
can
write
about
this
pitzela
son
is
such
a
poor
old
man
that
he
can
hardly
walk
he
has
a
long
white
beard
and
wears
a
yamulka
and
he
has
no
teeth
and
one
foot
is
already
deep
in
the
grave
if
you
saw
pitzela
son

would
say

and
sit
down
instead
of
running
around

much
you
do
need
any
point
the
point
feodor
excuse
me
well
the
point
is
that
pitzela
and
the
way
he
treats
his
son
is
a
scandal
you
know
why
because
he
uses
his
son
as
an
advertisement
pitzela
son
mind
you
is
so
weak
and
old
that
he
can
hardly
walk
and
he
carries
a
heavy
cane
and
his
hands
shake
like
leaves
and
pitzela
drags
him
around
all
over
to
banquets
to
political
meetings
to
the
yiddish
theater
all
over
he
holds
him
by
the
arm
and
brings
him
into
the
hall
and
sits
him
down
in
a
chair
and
pitzela
son
sits
so
tired
and
almost
dead
he
ca
move
and
then
pitzela
jumps
up
and
gets
excited
and
says
at
him
a
fine
son
for
you
look
he
almost
dead
tell
me
if
you
would
think
he
was
my
father
and
i
was
his
son
instead
of
the
other
way
around
i
ask
you
and
what
does
pitzela
son
say
feodor
say
what
can
he
say
he
looks
up
and
shakes
his
head
some
more
he
can
hardly
see
and
when
the
banquet
talking
begins
he
falls
asleep
and
pitzela
has
to
hold
him
up
from
falling
out
of
the
chair
and
when
the
food
is
done
and
the
dessert
comes
pitzela
leans
over
and
says
to
his
son
i
got
a
treat
for
you
here
and
he
reaches
into
his
pocket
and
brings
out
a
handful
of
hickory
nuts
them
with
your
teeth
he
says
your
father
and
when
his
son
looks
at
him
and
strokes
his
white
beard
and
sighs
pitzela
jumps
up
and
laughs
so
you
can
hear
him
all
over
the
banquet
hall
but
the
point
of
the
story
is
that
two
weeks
ago
pitzela
went
to
his
grandson
funeral
it
was
pitzela
son
son
and
he
was
a
man
almost
years
old
and
it
was
a
scandal
at
the
funeral
why
because
pitzela
laughed
and
coming
back
from
the
grave
he
said
at
me
my
grandson
dies
and
i
go
to
his
funeral
and
if
he
had
a
son
i
would
go
to
his
too
and
i
would
dance
jigs
both
times
pandora
box
a
dark
afternoon
with
summer
thunder
in
the
sky
the
skyscrapers
spread
a
checkerboard
of
window
lights
through
the
gloom
it
rains
people
seem
to
grow
vaguely
elate
on
the
dark
wet
pavements
they
hurry
along
their
eyes
saying
to
one
another
we
have
something
in
common
we
are
all
getting
wet
in
the
rain
the
crowd
is
no
longer
quite
so
enigmatic
a
stranger
to
itself
an
errand
boy
from
market
street
advances
with
leaps
through
the
downpour
a
high
chant
on
his
lips
raining
it
raining
the
rain
mutters
and
the
pavements
like
darkened
mirrors
grow
alive
with
impressionistic
cartoons
of
the
city
inside
the
washington
street
book
store
of
the
electric
lights
gleam
cozily
new
books
and
old
books
the
high
shelves
stuffed
with
books
vanish
in
the
ceiling
shadows
on
a
rainy
day
the
dusty
army
of
books
peers
coaxingly
from
the
shelves
old
tales
old
myths
old
wars
old
dreams
begin
to
chatter
softly
in
the
shadows
or
it
may
be
the
chatter
of
the
rain
on
the
pavement
outside
the
great
philosophers
unbend
the
bearded
classics
sigh
the
pontifical
critics
of
life
murmur
ahem
yes
even
the
forbidding
works
of
standard
authors
grow
lonely
on
the
high
shelves
on
a
rainy
day
as
for
the
crowd
in
motley
the
bulged
spavined
sniffling
crew
of
mountebanks
troubadours
swashbucklers
bleary
philosophers
phantasts
and
adventurers
they
set
up
a
veritable
witches
chorus
or
it
may
be
the
rain
again
lashing
against
the
streaming
windows
of
the
book
store
people
come
in
out
of
the
rain
a
girl
without
an
umbrella
her
face
wet
who
perhaps
a
stenographer
hunting
a
job
and
halted
by
the
rain
and
then
a
matron
with
an
knitted
shopping
bag
and
a
spinster
with
a
keen
kindly
face
others
too
they
stand
nervously
idle
feeling
that
they
are
taking
up
valuable
space
in
an
industrial
establishment
and
should
perhaps
make
a
purchase
so
they
permit
their
eyes
to
drift
politely
toward
the
wares
and
then
the
chatter
of
the
books
has
them
old
books
new
books
live
books
dead
books
but
they
move
carelessly
away
and
toward
the
bargain
tables
all
books
cents
broken
down
best
sellers
here
pausing
in
their

toward

come
in
a

in
a
curious

a
curious

and
a
curious

behind

a

an

out

from

he
approaches
the
high

thrusts
the

farther
down

the

alive
with

they
move
about
furtively
with
no
word
for
one
another
lost
in
their
grotesque
dreamings
on
a
rainy
day
the
city
gives
them
up
and
they
come
puttering
excitedly
into
the
loop
on
a
quest
the
world
is
a
garish
unreality
to
them
the
streets
and
the
crowds
of
men
and
women
the
upward
rush
of
buildings
and
the
horizontal
rush
of
traffic
are
no
more
than
vague
grimacings
life
is
something
of
which
the
streets
are
oblivious
but
here
on
the
gargoyle
shelves
the
high
shadowed
shelves
of
the
old
book
store
truth
stands
in
all
its
terrible
reality
wrapped
in
its
authentic
habiliments
hickson
of
the
psychopathic
laboratory
would
give
these
curious
rainy
day
phantasts
identities
as
weird
as
the
volumes
they
caress
but
the
old
book
store
clerk
is
more
kind
he
lets
them
rummage
before
the
rain
ends
they
will
buy
the
cradle
of
the
giants
the
key
to
satanism
cornelius
agrippa
natural
magic
the
astral
chord
occultism
and
its
usages
they
will
buy
books
by
jacob
boehme
william
law
sadler
hyslop
ramachaska
and
they
will
go
hurrying
home
with
their
treasures
pressed
close
to
them
stuffy
bedrooms
lined
with
hints
of
sabbatical
horror
strewn
with
bizarre
refuse
musty
smelling
books
out
of
whose
pages
fantastic
shapes
rear
themselves
against
the
gaslights
macabre
worlds
in
which
unreason
rides
like
a
headless
evenings
in
the
park
arguing
suddenly
with
startled
strangers
on
the
existence
of
the
philosophers
stone
or
the
astrological
causes
of
influenza
these
form
a
background
for
the
curious
men
whom
the
rain
has
drifted
into
the
old
book
store
and
who
stand
with
their
eyes
haunting
the
gargoyle
titles
the
rain
brings
in
another
tribesman
a
famed
though
somewhat
ragged
bibliomaniac
his
casual
gestures
hide
the
sudden
fever
old
books
kindle
in
his
thought
old
books
old
books
a
magical
phrase
to
him
his
eyes
travel
like
a
lover
back
and
forth
up
and
down
he
knows
them
all
the
sets
the
first
editions
the
bargains
the
a
democratic
lover
is
here
but
the
clerk
watches
him
for
this
lover
is
an
antagonist
yes
this
somewhat
ragged
gentleman
with
the
casual
manner
is
a
terrible
person
to
have
around
in
a
book
store
on
a
rainy
day
only
six
months
ago
one
of
his
horrible
tribe
pounced
upon
indian
wars
price
cents
value
alas
only
two
months
ago
another
of
his
kidney
fell
upon
a
copy
of
jean
jacques
rosseau
emile
with
jean
own
dedication
on
the
title
page
to
his
majesty
the
king
of
france
price
cents
value
gadzooks
there
will
be
nothing
today
however
merely
an
hour
caress
of
old
friends
on
the
high
shelves
while
the
rain
beats
outside
unless
unless
this
stevenson
happens
by
any
chance
to
be
a
first
a
furtive
glance
at
the
title
page
no
the
clerk
sighs
with
relief
as
the
stevenson
goes
back
on
the
shelf
it
might
have
been
something
overlooked
the
rain
ends
the
old
book
store
slowly
empties
a
troop
of
men
and
women
saunter
out
pausing
to
say
farewell
to
the
gaudily
ragged
tomes
in
the
old
book
store
the
sky
has
grown
lighter
the
buildings
shake
the
last
drops
of
rain
from
their
spatula
tops
there
is
a
gentleman
thrusts
his
head
into
the
old
book
store
and
inquires
have
you
a
copy
of
investors
guide
the
beggar
in
the
street
sitting
on
the
pavement
against
the
building
with
his
pleading
face
raised
and
his
arm
outstretched
i
do
like
him
i
do
like
the
way
he
tucks
his
one
good
leg
under
him
in
order
to
convey
the
impression
that
he
is
entirely
legless
i
do
like
the
way
he
thrusts
his
arm
stump
at
me
the
way
his
eyes
plead
his
weakness
and
sorrow
he
is
a
presumptuous
and
calculating
scoundrel
this
beggar
he
is
a
diabolical
psychologist
why
will
people
drop
coins
into
his
hat
ah
because
when
they
look
at
him
and
his
misfortunes
by
a
common
mental
ruse
they
see
themselves
in
his
place
and
they
hurriedly
fling
a
coin
to
this
fugitive
image
of
themselves
and
because
in
back
of
this
beggar
has
grown
up
an
insidious
propaganda
that
power
is
wrong
that
strength
is
evil
that
riches
are
vile
a
strong
rich
and
powerful
man
can
not
get
into
heaven
thus
this
beggar
becomes
for
an
instant
an
intimidating
symbol
of
perfections
one
feels
that
one
should
apologize
for
the
fact
that
one
has
two
legs
money
in
one
pocket
and
hope
in
one
heart
one
flings
him
a
coin
thus
buying
momentary
absolution
for
not
being
an
unfortunate
as
noble
and
as
the
beggar
i
do
not
like
the
way
this
beggar
pleads
and
yet
after
i
pass
him
and
remember
his
calculating
expression
his
mountebank
tricks
i
grow
fond
of
him
theoretically
my
thought
warms
to
him
as
a
creature
of
intelligence
of
straightforward
and
amusing
cynicisms
for
this
beggar
is
aware
of
me
and
the
innumerable
lies
to
which
i
lamely
submit
i
am
the
public
to
him
one
of
a
herd
of
identical
faces
drifting
by
and
this
beggar
has
perfected
a
technique
of
attack
it
is
his
duty
to
sit
on
the
pavement
and
lay
for
me
and
hit
me
with
a
slapstick
labeled
platitude
and
soak
me
over
the
head
with
a
bladder
labeled
in
stern
white
letters
the
poor
shall
inherit
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
this
he
does
the
scoundrel
grinning
to
himself
as
the
blows
fall
and
slyly
concealing
his
enthusiasm
as
the
coins
jingle
into
his
hat
i
am
one
of
those
who
labor
proudly
at
the
immemorial
task
of
idealizations
i
am
the
public
who
passes
laws
proclaiming
things
wrong
immoral
contrary
to
my
best
instincts
thus
i
have
after
many
centuries
succeeded
in
creating
a
beautiful
conception
a
marvelous
person
this
marvelous
person
represents
what
i
might
be
if
i
had
neither
ambition
nor
corpuscles
prejudices
nor
ecstasties
greeds
lusts
illusions
or
curiosity
this
marvelous
person
is
the
beautiful
image
the
noble
and
flattering
image
of
itself
that
the
public
rapturously
beholds
when
it
stares
into
the
mirror
of
laws
conventions
adages
platitudes
and
constitutions
that
it
has
created
a
charming
image
to
contemplate
learned
men
wax
full
of
stern
joy
when
they
gaze
upon
this
image
folk
thrill
with
pride
at
the
thought
that
life
is
at
last
a
carefully
policed
force
which
flows
politely
and
properly
through
the
catalogued
veins
of
this
marvelous
person
but
my
beggar
in
the
street
ah
my
beggar
in
the
street
knows
better
my
beggar
in
the
street
maimed
and
vicious
sits
against
the
building
and
wields
his
bladder
and
his
slapstick
on
me
whang
a
platitude
on
the
rear
bam
a
bromide
on
the
bean
and
i
shell
out
a
dime
and
hurry
on
i
do
not
like
this
beggar
but
i
grow
warm
with
fellowship
toward
him
after
i
have
left
him
behind
there
is
something
comradely
about
his
amazing
cynicism
people
thinks
this
beggar
are
ashamed
of
themselves
for
being
strong
for
having
two
legs
for
not
being
poor
humble
mendicants
people
thinks
this
beggar
are
secretly
ashamed
of
themselves
for
being
part
of
success
and
their
shame
is
inspired
by
fear
when
they
see
me
they
suddenly
feel
uncertain
about
themselves
when
they
see
me
they
think
that
reverses
and
misfortunes
and
calamities
might
overtake
them
and
reduce
them
to
my
condition
thinking
this
they
grow
indignant
for
an
instant
with
a
society
that
produces
beggars
not
because
it
produced
me
but
perhaps
it
might
produce
them
as
beggars
and
then
remembering
that
they
are
responsible
for
my
plight
they
being
society
they
beg
my
pardon
by
giving
me
money
and
a
pleading
look
oho
you
should
see
the
pleading
looks
they
give
me
men
and
women
pass
and
plead
with
me
not
to
hit
them
too
hard
with
my
slapstick
and
bladder
they
plead
with
me
to
spare
them
not
to
look
at
them
and
when
they
give
me
a
dime
it
is
a
gesture
intended
to
annihilate
me
the
dime
obliterates
my
misfortunes
it
annihilates
my
poverty
for
an
instant
having
annihilated
poverty
and
misfortune
with
a
dime
the
man
or
woman
is
happy
an
instant
of
security
strengthens
his
wavering
spirit
thus
my
beggar
whom
i
have
grown
quite
fond
of
as
i
write
i
would
write
more
of
him
and
of
the
marvelous
person
in
me
whom
he
is
continually
belaboring
with
his
slapstick
and
bladder
but
i
remember
suddenly
a
man
in
a
wheel
chair
a
pale
man
with
drawn
features
and
paralyzed
legs
it
was
at
night
in
north
clark
street
lights
streamed
over
the
pavements
people
moved
in
and
out
of
doorways
and
this
man
sat
in
his
wheel
chair
a
board
on
his
lap
the
board
was
laden
with
wares
trinkets
pencils
shoestrings
candies
tacks
neckties
socks
and
from
the
front
of
the
board
hung
a
sign
reading
jim
store
stop
and
shop
i
remember
this
creature
with
a
sudden
excitement
i
passed
by
and
bought
nothing
but
after
five
days
his
face
has
caught
up
with
me
a
sallow
drawn
face
burning
eyes
bloodless
lips
and
skinny
hands
that
fumbled
among
the
wares
on
his
board
he
was
young
heroic
sentences
come
to
me
jim
store
good
hokum
effective
advertising
and
a
strange
pathos
a
pathos
that
my
beggar
with
one
leg
and
a
pleading
face
never
had
i
do
not
like
cynics
i
like
jim
better
i
like
jim
and
his
burning
eyes
his
skinny
hands
his
dying
body
and
his
store
fighting
with
the
lights
going
out
sitting
in
a
wheel
chair
with
death
at
his
back
and
despair
crying
from
his
eyes
come
buy
from
me
a
little
while
longer
i
give
up
another
week
another
month
but
i
do
give
up

on
the
turf
never
mind
my
dying
body

as
usual
business
as
usual

from
me

while
longer

i
never
gave
a
nickel

him
at
his
word
he
was
selling
wares
and
i
did
want
any
but
my
beggar
with
the
one
leg
and
the
inward
grin
was
selling
absolutions
and
i
patronized
him
the
man
with
a
question
late
afternoon
an
hour
more
and
the
city
will
be
emptying
itself
out
of
the
high
buildings
now
the
shoppers
are
hurrying
home
to
get
dinner
on
the
table
a
man
stands
on
the
corner
of
michigan
avenue
and
adams
street
unwittingly
he
invites
attention
a
poorly
dressed
man
with
a
face
and
coarsened
hands
but
he
stands
motionless
more
than
that
he
is
not
looking
at
anything
his
eyes
seem
to
withhold
themselves
from
the
active
street
in
the
sauve
spectacle
of
the
avenue
his
motionless
figure
is
like
an
awkward
faux
pas
in
a
parlor
conversation
the
newspaper
man
on
his
way
to
the
station
pauses
to
light
his
pipe
and
his
eyes
take
in
the
figure
of
this
motionless
one
the
newspaper
man
notices
that
the
man
stands
like
one
who
is
braced
against
something
that
may
come
suddenly
and
that
his
eyes
say
we
know
what
we
know
there
are
other
impressions
that
interest
the
newspaper
man
for
a
moment
the
motionless
one
seems
a
blurred
little
unit
of
the
hurrying
crowd
then
for
a
moment
he
seems
to
grow
large
and
his
figure
becomes
commanding
and
it
is
as
if
he
were
surveying
the
blurred
little
faces
of
the
hurrying
crowd
this
is
undoubtedly
because
he
is
standing
still
and
not
looking
at
anything
can
i
have
a
light
please
the
man
voice
is
low
a
bit
hoarse
he
has
a
pipe
and
the
newspaper
man
gives
him
a
match
ah
the
amiable
meaningless
curiosity
of
newspaper
men
this
one
must
ask
questions
it
is
after
work
but
like
the
policeman
who
goes
to
the
movies
with
his
club
still
at
his
side
he
is
still
asking
questions
taking
in
the
sights
the
man
lighting
his
pipe
nods
slowly
much
too
slowly
as
if
his
answer
were
fraught
with
a
vast
significance
i
like
it
myself
insinuates
the
newspaper
man
i
was
reading
junius
wood
article
on
bill
shatov
who
is
running
things
now
in
siberia
he
quotes
bill
as
saying
what
he
misses
most
in
life
now
is
the
music
of
crowds
in
chicago
streets
did
you
read
that
this
is
a
brazen
lead
but
the
man
looks
like
a
red
and
bill
shatov
would
then
open
the
talk
but
the
man
only
shakes
his
head
he
says
no
i
do
read
the
papers
much
now
there
is
something
contradictory
about
this
man
and
his
curtness
invites
he
seems
to
have
accepted
the
presence
of
the
newspaper
man
in
an
odd
way
an
uncity
way
after
a
pause
he
gestures
slightly
with
his
pipe
in
his
hand
and
says
quite
a
crowd
eh
the
newspaper
man
nods
the
other
goes
on
where
are
they
going
this
is
more
than
a
question
there
is
indignation
in
it
the
deepset
eyes
gleam
i
wonder
says
the
newspaper
man
his
companion
remains
staring
in
his
odd
unseeing
way
then
he
says
they
do
look
at
anything
eh
in
a
terrible
hurry
ai
they
yeah
in
a
rotten
hurry
the
newspaper
man
nods
which
way
you
going
he
asks
no
way
his
companion
answers
no
way
at
all
i
standin
here
see
there
is
a
silence
the
motionless
one
has
become
something
queer
in
the
eyes
of
the
newspaper
man
he
has
become
grim
definite
taunting
here
is
a
man
who
questions
the
people
of
the
street
with
unseeing
eyes
why
here
is
one
who
is
going
no
way
yet
look
at
him
closely
and
there
is
no
sneer
in
his
eyes
his
lips
hold
no
contempt
there
you
have
it
he
is
a
questioning
man
he
is
questioning
things
that
no
one
questions
buildings
crowds
windows
and
there
is
some
sort
of
answer
inside
him
what
you
talking
to
me
for
the
newspaper
man
smiles
disarmingly
at
this
sudden
inquiry
oh
i
do
know
he
says
saw
you
standing
still
you
looked
different
wondered
you
know
just
kind
of
thought
to
say
hello
funny
says
the
motionless
one
i
got
a
hunch
you
a
stranger
in
town
this
question
the
companion
answers
yeah
a
stranger
a
stranger
what
i
am
all
right
i
a
stranger
all
right
you
got
me
right
now
the
motionless
one
smiles
this
makes
his
face
look
uncomfortable
this
makes
it
seem
as
if
he
had
been
frowning
savagely
before
what
do
you
think
of
this
town
pursues
the
newspaper
man
think
of
this
town
think
say
i
ai
thinking
i
do
think
anything
of
it
i
just
looking
at
it
see
a
stranger
do
ever
think
now
does
he
there
that
one
for
you
when
you
come
here
when
i
come
here
when
well
i
come
here
this
noon
on
the
noon
train
say
do
make
me
gabby
i
never
gab
any
nothing
to
be
got
out
of
this
motionless
one
nothing
but
a
question
a
pause
however
and
he
went
on
have
you
ever
seen
such
a
crowd
like
this
hurrying
hm
some
town
there
used
to
be
a
hotel
over
here
west
a
bit
the
wellington
yeah
i
do
see
it
when
i
pass
torn
down
hm
the
eyes
narrow
for
an
instant
then
the
motionless
one
sighs
and
his
shoulders
loosen
his
face
grows
alive
and
he
looks
this
way
and
that
he
starts
to
walk
and
walks
quickly
leaving
the
newspaper
man
standing
alone
the
newspaper
man
watched
him
as
he
stood
looking
after
him
some
one
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
he
turned
specs
mclaughlin
of
the
detective
bureau
specs
rubbed
his
chin
contemplatively
and
smiled
know
that
guy
who
no
just
bumped
into
him
how
come
you
might
have
got
a
story
out
of
him
specs
grinned
that
george
cook
just
let
out
of
the
joliet
pen
this
morning
served
fourteen
years
quite
a
yarn
at
the
time
for
killing
a
pal
in
the
wellington
hotel
over
some
dame
i
guess
that
was
before
your
time
though
he
just
landed
in
town
this
noon
the
detective
rubbered
into
the
moving
crowd
i
sort
of
keeping
an
eye
on
him
he
said
and
hurried
on
grass
figures
you
will
sometimes
notice
when
you
sit
on
the
back
porch
after
dinner
that
there
are
other
back
porches
with
people
on
them
and
when
you
sit
on
the
front
steps
that
there
are
other
front
steps
similarly
occupied
in
the
park
when
you
lie
down
on
the
grass
you
will
see
there
are
others
lying
on
the
grass
and
when
you
look
out
of
your
window
you
can
observe
other
people
looking
out
of
their
windows
in
the
streets
when
you
walk
casually
and
have
time
to
look
around
you
will
see
others
walking
casually
and
looking
around
too
and
in
the
theater
or
church
or
where
you
work
there
are
always
the
inevitable
others
always
reflecting
yourself
you
might
get
to
thinking
about
this
as
the
newspaper
reporter
did
the
newspaper
reporter
got
an
idea
one
day
that
the
city
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
vast
broken
mirror
giving
him
back
garbled
images
of
himself
the
newspaper
reporter
was
trying
to
write
fiction
stories
on
the
side
and
he
thought
if
i
can
figure
out
something
for
a
background
some
idea
or
something
that
will
explain
about
people
and
then
have
the
plot
of
the
story
sort
of
prove
this
general
idea
by
a
specific
incident
that
would
be
the
way
to
work
it
thus
when
the
reporter
had
figured
it
out
that
the
city
was
a
mirror
reflecting
himself
he
grew
excited
that
was
the
kind
of
idea
he
had
always
been
looking
for
but
at
night
in
his
bedroom
when
he
started
to
write
he
hit
a
snag
he
had
thought
he
held
in
his
mind
the
secret
of
the
city
yet
when
he
came
to
write
about
it
the
secret
slipped
away
and
left
him
with
nothing
he
sat
looking
out
of
his
bedroom
window
noticing
that
the
telephone
poles
in
the
dark
alley
looked
like
huge
inverted
music
notes
then
he
thought
it
does
do
any
good
to
get
an
idea
that
does
tell
you
anything
just
figuring
out
that
the
city
is
a
mirror
that
reflects
me
all
the
time
does
give
me
the
secret
of
streets
and
crowds
because
the
question
then
arises
am
i
that
the
mirror
reflects
and
what
am
i
what
in
sam
hill
is
my
motif
so
the
newspaper
reporter
decided
to
wait
awhile
before
he
wrote
his
story
wait
at
least
until
he
had
found
out
something
but
the
next
day
while
he
was
walking
in
michigan
avenue
the
idea
he
had
had
about
the
mirror
trotted
along
beside
him
like
some
homeless
hector
pup
that
he
could
shake
he
looked
up
eagerly
into
the
faces
of
the
crowd
on
the
street
searching
the
many
different
eyes
that
moved
by
him
for
a
lead
what
the
newspaper
reporter
wanted
was
to
be
able
to
begin
his
fiction
story
by
saying
something
like
this
people
are
so
and
so
the
city
is
so
and
so
everybody
feels
this
and
this
no
matter
who
they
are
or
where
they
live
or
what
their
jobs
are
they
ca
escape
the
mark
of
the
city
that
is
on
them
it
was
after
and
the
people
in
michigan
avenue
were
going
home
or
sauntering
back
and
forth
looking
into
the
shop
windows
with
nothing
much
to
do
the
street
was
still
light
although
the
sun
had
gone
hidden
behind
the
buildings
of
the
city
the
sun
flattened
itself
out
on
an
invisible
horizon
and
spread
a
vast
peacock
tail
of
color
across
the
sky
in
grant
park
opposite
the
public
library
men
lay
on
their
backs
with
their
hands
folded
under
their
heads
and
stared
up
into
the
colors
of
the
sky
the
newspaper
reporter
stood
abstractedly
on
the
corner
counting
the
automobiles
that
purred
by
to
see
if
more
taxicabs
than
privately
owned
cars
passed
a
given
point
in
michigan
avenue
then
he
walked
across
the
street
for
no
other
reason
than
that
there
were
for
the
moment
no
more
automobiles
to
count
he
stopped
on
the
opposite
pavement
and
stood
looking
at
the
figures
that
lay
on
the
grass
in
grant
park
the
newspaper
reporter
had
been
lying
for
ten
minutes
on
his
back
in
the
grass
when
he
sat
up
suddenly
and
muttered
here
it
is
right
in
front
of
me
he
sat
looking
intently
at
the
men
who
were
lying
on
the
grass
as
he
had
been
a
moment
before
and
his
idea
about
the
city
being
a
mirror
giving
him
back
images
of
himself
started
up
again
in
his
mind
but
now
he
could
find
out
what
these
images
of
himself
were
in
fact
what
he
was
whereupon
he
would
have
his
story
being
a
newspaper
reporter
there
was
nothing
unusual
in
his
mind
about
walking
up
to
one
of
the
figures
and
talking
to
it
for
years
and
years
he
had
done
just
that
for
a
living
walked
up
to
strangers
and
asked
them
questions
so
now
he
would
ask
the
men
lying
on
their
backs
what
they
were
lying
on
their
backs
for
he
would
ask
them
why
they
came
to
grant
park
what
they
were
thinking
about
and
how
it
happened
that
they
all
looked
alike
and
lay
on
their
backs
like
a
chorus
of
figures
in
a
pastoral
musical
comedy
the
first
figure
the
newspaper
reporter
approached
listened
to
the
questions
in
surprise
then
he
answered
well
i
dunno
i
just
came
into
the
park
and
lay
down
the
second
figure
looked
blank
and
shook
its
head
the
reporter
tried
a
third
the
third
figure
grinned
and
answered
oh
well
nothing
much
to
do
and
the
grass
rests
you
a
bit
the
reporter
kept
on
for
a
few
minutes
asking
his
questions
and
getting
answers
that
did
quite
mean
anything
then
he
grew
tired
of
the
job
and
returned
to
his
original
place
on
the
grass
and
lay
down
again
and
stared
up
into
the
colors
of
the
sky
after
a
during
which
he
had
thought
of
nothing
in
particular
he
arose
shook
his
legs
free
of
dirt
and
grass
and
walked
away
as
he
walked
he
looked
at
the
figures
that
remained
the
arc
lamps
on
the
park
shafts
and
on
the
fountain
were
popping
on
and
the
avenue
was
lighting
up
like
a
theater
with
the
footlights
going
on
funny
about
them
the
newspaper
reporter
thought
eyeing
the
figures
as
he
moved
away
they
lie
there
on
their
backs
all
in
the
same
position
all
looking
at
the
same
clouds
so
they
must
all
be
thinking
thoughts
about
the
same
thing
let
see
what
was
i
thinking
about
nothing
an
excited
light
came
suddenly
into
the
newspaper
reporter
eyes
i
was
just
waiting
he
muttered
to
himself
and
so
are
they
the
newspaper
reporter
looked
eagerly
at
the
street
and
the
people
passing
that
was
it
he
had
found
the
word
waiting
everybody
was
waiting
on
the
back
porches
at
night
on
the
front
steps
in
the
parks
in
the
theaters
churches
streets
and
stores
men
and
women
waited
just
as
the
men
on
the
grass
in
grant
park
were
waiting
the
only
difference
between
the
men
lying
on
their
backs
and
people
elsewhere
was
that
the
men
in
the
grass
had
grown
tired
for
the
moment
of
pretending
they
were
doing
anything
else
so
they
had
stretched
themselves
out
in
an
attitude
of
waiting
in
a
deliberate
posture
of
waiting
and
with
their
eyes
on
the
sky
they
waited
the
newspaper
reporter
felt
thrilled
as
he
thought
all
this
he
felt
thrilled
when
he
looked
closely
at
the
people
in
michigan
avenue
and
saw
that
they
fitted
snugly
into
his
theory
he
said
to
himself
discovered
a
theory
about
life
a
theory
that
fits
them
all
that
makes
the
background
i
looking
for
waiting
yes
the
whole
pack
of
them
are
waiting
all
the
time
that
why
we
all
look
alike
that
why
one
house
looks
like
another
and
one
man
walking
looks
like
another
man
walking
and
why
figures
lying
in
the
grass
look
like
twins
scores
of
twins
the
newspaper
man
returned
to
his
bedroom
and
started
to
write
again
but
he
had
been
writing
only
a
few
minutes
when
he
stopped
again
as
it
had
before
the
secret
had
slipped
out
of
his
mind
for
he
had
come
to
a
paragraph
that
was
to
tell
what
the
people
were
waiting
for
and
he
could
think
of
any
answer
to
that
what
were
the
men
in
the
grass
waiting
for
in
the
street
on
the
porches
and
stone
steps
they
were
images
of
himself
all
waiting
images
of
himself
therefore
the
answer
lay
in
the
question
what
had
he
been
waiting
for
the
newspaper
reporter
bit
into
his
pencil
nothing
nothing
he
muttered
yes
that
it
they
are
waiting
for
anything
that
the
secret
life
is
a
few
years
of
suspended
animation
but
there
no
story
in
that
better
forget
it
so
he
looked
glumly
out
of
his
bedroom
window
and
being
a
sentimentalist
the
huge
inverted
music
notes
the
telephone
poles
made
against
the
dark
played
a
long
sad
tune
in
his
mind
