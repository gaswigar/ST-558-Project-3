introduction
flavius
claudius
julianus
son
of
julius
constantius
and
nephew
of
the
emperor
constantine
was
born
at
constantinople
in
his
father
eldest
brother
and
cousins
were
slain
in
the
massacre
by
which
constantius
constantine
and
constans
secured
the
empire
for
themselves
on
the
death
of
their
father
constantine
in
julian
and
his
elder
brother
gallus
spent
a
precarious
childhood
and
youth
of
which
six
years
were
passed
in
close
confinement
in
the
remote
castle
of
macellum
in
cappadocia
and
their
position
was
hardly
more
secure
when
in
gallus
was
elevated
to
the
caesarship
by
constantius
who
after
the
violent
deaths
of
his
two
brothers
was
now
sole
ruler
of
the
empire
but
julian
was
allowed
to
pursue
his
favourite
studies
in
greek
literature
and
philosophy
partly
at
nicomedia
and
athens
partly
in
the
cities
of
asia
minor
and
he
was
deeply
influenced
by
maximus
of
ephesus
the
occult
philosopher
libanius
of
nicomedia
the
fashionable
sophist
and
themistius
the
aristotelian
commentator
the
only
genuine
philosopher
among
the
sophists
of
the
fourth
century
when
the
excesses
of
the
revolutionary
gallus
ended
in
his
death
at
the
hands
of
constantius
julian
an
awkward
and
retiring
student
was
summoned
to
the
court
at
milan
where
he
was
protected
by
the
empress
eusebia
from
the
suspicions
of
constantius
and
the
intrigues
of
hostile
courtiers
constantius
had
no
heir
to
continue
the
dynasty
of
the
constantii
he
therefore
raised
julian
to
the
caesarship
in
gave
him
his
sister
helena
in
marriage
and
dispatched
him
to
gaul
to
pacify
the
gallic
provinces
to
the
surprise
of
all
julian
in
four
successive
campaigns
against
the
franks
and
the
alemanis
proved
himself
a
good
soldier
and
a
popular
general
his
on
these
campaigns
are
praised
by
eunapius
and
libanius
but
are
not
now
extant
in
constantius
who
was
occupied
by
wars
against
the
quadi
and
the
sarmatians
and
threatened
with
a
renewal
of
hostilities
by
the
persian
king
sapor
ordered
julian
who
was
then
at
paris
to
send
to
his
aid
the
best
of
the
gallic
legions
julian
would
have
obeyed
but
his
troops
unwilling
to
take
service
in
the
east
mutinied
and
proclaimed
him
emperor
julian
issued
manifestoes
justifying
his
conduct
to
the
senates
of
rome
and
athens
and
to
the
spartans
and
corinthians
a
characteristic
anachronism
since
their
opinion
no
longer
had
any
weight
it
was
not
till
that
he
began
his
march
eastward
to
encounter
the
army
of
constantius
his
troops
though
seasoned
and
devoted
were
in
numbers
no
match
for
the
legions
of
his
cousin
but
the
latter
while
marching
through
cilicia
to
oppose
his
advance
died
suddenly
of
a
fever
near
tarsus
and
julian
now
in
his
thirtieth
year
succeeded
peacefully
to
the
throne
and
made
a
triumphal
entry
into
constantinople
in
december
the
eunuchs
and
courtiers
who
had
surrounded
constantius
were
replaced
by
sophists
and
philosophers
and
in
the
next
six
months
julian
set
on
foot
numerous
economic
and
administrative
reforms
he
had
long
been
secretly
devoted
to
the
pagan
religion
and
he
at
once
proclaimed
the
restoration
of
the
pagan
gods
and
the
temple
worship
christianity
he
tolerated
and
in
his
brief
reign
of
sixteen
months
the
christians
were
not
actively
persecuted
his
treatise
the
which
survives
only
in
fragments
was
an
explanation
of
his
apostasy
the
epithet
apostate
was
bestowed
on
him
by
the
christian
fathers
meanwhile
he
was
at
constantinople
then
at
antioch
where
he
wrote
the
a
satire
on
the
luxury
and
frivolity
of
the
a
campaign
against
sapor
a
task
which
he
had
inherited
from
constantius
in
march
he
left
antioch
and
crossed
the
euphrates
visited
carrhae
memorable
for
the
defeat
of
crassus
then
crossed
the
tigris
and
after
burning
his
fleet
retired
northwards
towards
armenia
on
the
march
he
fought
an
indecisive
battle
with
the
persians
at
maranga
and
in
a
skirmish
with
the
retreating
enemy
he
was
mortally
wounded
by
a
javelin
january
his
body
was
carried
to
tarsus
by
his
successor
the
emperor
jovian
and
was
probably
removed
later
to
constantinople
the
legend
that
as
he
died
he
exclaimed
γαλιλαῖε
νενίκηκας
thou
hast
conquered
o
galilæan
appears
first
in
the
christian
historian
theodoret
in
the
fifth
century
julian
was
the
last
male
descendant
of
the
famous
dynasty
founded
by
constantius
chlorus
in
spite
of
his
military
achievements
he
was
first
of
all
a
student
even
on
his
campaigns
he
took
his
books
with
him
and
several
of
his
extant
works
were
composed
in
camp
he
had
been
trained
according
to
the
fashion
of
his
times
in
rhetorical
studies
by
professional
sophists
such
as
libanius
and
he
has
all
the
mannerisms
of
a
fourth
century
sophist
it
was
the
sophistic
etiquette
to
avoid
the
direct
use
of
names
and
julian
never
names
the
usurpers
magnentius
silvanus
and
vetranio
whose
suppression
by
constantius
he
describes
in
his
two
first
regularly
refers
to
sapor
as
the
barbarian
and
rather
than
name
mardonius
his
tutor
calls
him
a
certain
scythian
who
had
the
same
name
as
the
man
who
persuaded
xerxes
to
invade
he
wrote
the
literary
greek
of
the
fourth
century
which
imitates
the
classical
style
though
barbarisms
and
late
constructions
are
never
entirely
avoided
his
pages
are
crowded
with
echoes
of
homer
demosthenes
plato
and
isocrates
and
his
style
is
interwoven
with
half
verses
phrases
and
whole
sentences
taken
without
acknowledgment
from
the
greek
masterpieces
it
is
certain
that
like
other
sophists
he
wished
his
readers
to
recognise
these
echoes
and
therefore
his
source
is
always
classical
so
that
where
he
seems
to
imitate
dio
chrysostom
or
themistius
both
go
back
to
a
common
source
which
julian
had
in
mind
another
sophistic
element
in
his
style
is
the
use
of
commonplaces
literary
allusions
that
had
passed
into
the
sophistic
language
and
can
be
found
in
all
the
writers
of
reminiscence
greek
in
his
day
he
himself
derides
this
practice
but
he
can
not
resist
dragging
in
the
references
to
cyrus
darius
and
alexander
to
the
nepenthe
poured
out
by
helen
in
the
to
the
defiance
of
nature
by
xerxes
or
the
refusal
of
socrates
to
admit
the
happiness
of
the
great
king
julian
wished
to
make
the
philosophy
of
his
revived
hellenism
but
he
belonged
to
the
younger
or
syrian
branch
of
the
school
of
which
iamblichus
was
the
real
founder
and
he
only
once
mentions
plotinus
iamblichus
he
ranked
with
plato
and
paid
him
a
fanatical
devotion
his
philosophical
writing
especially
in
the
two
prose
is
obscure
partly
because
his
theories
are
only
vaguely
realised
partly
because
he
reproduces
the
obscurity
of
his
model
iamblichus
in
satire
and
narrative
he
can
be
clear
and
straightforward

i
have
long
desired
most
mighty
emperor
to
sing
the
praises
of
your
valour
and
achievements
to
recount
your
campaigns
and
to
tell
how
you
suppressed
the
tyrannies
how
your
persuasive
eloquence
drew
away
one
usurper
s
bodyguard
how
you
overcame
another
by
force
of
arms
but
the
vast
scale
of
your
exploits
deterred
me
because
what
i
had
to
dread
was
not
that
my
words
would
fall
somewhat
short
of
your
achievements
but
that
i
should
prove
wholly
unequal
to
my
theme
that
men
versed
in
political
debate
or
poets
should
find
it
easy
to
compose
a
panegyric
on
your
career
is
not
at
all
surprising
their
practice
in
speaking
their
habit
of
declaiming
in
public
supplies
them
abundantly
with
a
warranted
confidence
but
those
who
have
neglected
this
field
and
chosen
another
branch
of
literary
study
which
devotes
itself
to
a
form
of
composition
little
adapted
to
win
popular
favour
and
that
has
not
the
hardihood
to
exhibit
itself
in
its
nakedness
in
every
theatre
no
matter
what
would
naturally
hesitate
to
make
speeches
of
the
epideictic
sort
as
for
the
poets
their
muse
and
the
general
belief
that
it
is
she
who
inspires
their
verse
obviously
gives
them
unlimited
license
to
invent
to
rhetoricians
the
art
of
rhetoric
allows
just
as
much
freedom
fiction
is
denied
them
but
flattery
is
by
no
means
forbidden
nor
is
it
counted
a
disgrace
to
the
orator
that
the
object
of
his
panegyric
should
not
deserve
it
poets
who
compose
and
publish
some
legend
that
no
one
had
thought
of
before
increase
their
reputation
because
an
audience
is
entertained
by
the
mere
fact
of
novelty
orators
again
assert
that
the
advantage
of
their
art
is
that
it
can
treat
a
slight
theme
in
the
grand
manner
and
again
by
the
use
of
mere
words
strip
the
greatness
from
deeds
and
in
short
marshall
the
power
of
words
against
that
of
facts

i
was
not
unfit
seeing
that
my
predecessors
had
already
shown
that
it
was
beyond
them
to
produce
a
record
worthy
of
your
achievements
for
almost
all
who
devote
themselves
to
literature
attempt
to
sing
your
praises
in
verse
or
prose
some
of
them
venture
to
cover
your
whole
career
in
a
brief
narrative
while
others
devote
themselves
to
a
part
only
and
think
that
if
they
succeed
in
doing
justice
to
that
part
they
have
proved
themselves
equal
to
the
task

one
can
but
admire
the
zeal
of
all
who
have
made
you
the
theme
of
a
panegyric
some
did
not
shrink
from
the
tremendous
effort
to
secure
every
one
of
your
achievements
from
the
withering
touch
of
time
others
because
they
foresaw
that
they
could
not
compass
the
whole
expressed
themselves
only
in
part
and
chose
to
consecrate
to
you
their
individual
work
so
far
as
they
were
able
better
this
they
thought
than
the
reward
of
silence
that
runs
no
now
if
i
were
one
of
those
whose
favourite
pursuit
is
epideictic
oratory
i
should
have
to
begin
my
speech
by
asking
from
you
no
less
goodwill
than
i
now
feel
towards
yourself
and
should
beg
you
graciously
to
incline
your
ear
to
my
words
and
not
play
the
part
of
a
severe
and
inexorable
critic
but
since
bred
as
i
have
been
and
educated
in
other
studies
other
pursuits
other
conventions
i
am
criticised
for
venturing
rashly
into
fields
that
belong
to
others
i
feel
that
i
ought
to
explain
myself
briefly
on
this
head
and
begin
my
speech
more
after
my
own
fashion

there
is
an
ancient
maxim
taught
by
him
who
first
introduced
philosophy
to
mankind
and
it
is
as
follows
all
who
aspire
to
virtue
and
the
beautiful
must
study
in
their
words
deeds
conversation
in
short
in
all
the
affairs
of
life
great
and
small
to
aim
in
every
way
at
beauty
now
what
sensible
man
would
deny
that
virtue
is
of
all
things
the
most
beautiful
wherefore
those
are
bidden
to
lay
firm
hold
on
her
who
do
not
seek
to
blazon
abroad
her
name
in
vain
appropriating
that
which
in
no
way
belongs
to
them
now
in
giving
this
counsel
the
maxim
does
not
prescribe
any
single
type
of
discourse
nor
does
it
proclaim
to
its
readers
like
a
god
from
the
machine
in
tragedy
ye
must
aspire
to
virtue
and
eschew
many
are
the
paths
that
it
allows
a
man
to
follow
to
this
goal
if
he
desire
to
imitate
the
nature
of
the
beautiful
for
example
he
may
give
good
advice
or
use
hortatory
discourse
or
he
may
rebuke
error
without
malice
or
applaud
what
is
well
done
or
condemn
on
occasion
what
is
ill
done
it
permits
men
also
to
use
other
types
of
oratory
if
they
please
so
as
to
attain
the
best
end
of
speech
but
it
enjoins
on
them
to
take
thought
in
every
word
and
act
how
they
shall
give
account
of
all
they
utter
and
to
speak
no
word
that
can
not
be
referred
to
the
standard
of
virtue
and
philosophy
that
and
more
to
the
same
effect
is
the
tenour
of
that
precept

and
now
what
am
i
to
do
what
embarrasses
me
is
the
fact
that
if
i
praise
you
i
shall
be
thought
simply
to
curry
favour
and
in
fact
the
department
of
panegyric
has
come
to
incur
a
grave
suspicion
due
to
its
misuse
and
is
now
held
to
be
base
flattery
rather
than
trustworthy
testimony
to
heroic
deeds
is
it
not
obvious
that
i
must
put
my
faith
in
the
merit
of
him
whom
i
undertake
to
praise
and
with
full
confidence
devote
my
energies
to
this
panegyric
what
then
shall
be
the
prelude
of
my
speech
and
the
most
suitable
arrangement
assuredly
i
must
begin
with
the
virtues
of
your
ancestors
through
which
it
was
possible
for
you
to
come
to
be
what
you
are
next
i
think
it
will
be
proper
to
describe
your
upbringing
and
education
since
these
contributed
very
much
to
the
noble
qualities
that
you
possess
and
when
i
have
dealt
with
all
these
i
must
recount
your
achievements
the
signs
and
tokens
as
it
were
of
the
nobility
of
your
soul
and
finally
as
the
crown
and
consummation
of
my
discourse
i
shall
set
forth
those
personal
qualities
from
which
was
evolved
all
that
was
noble
in
your
projects
and
their
execution
it
is
in
this
respect
that
i
think
my
speech
will
surpass
those
of
all
the
others
for
some
limit
themselves
to
your
exploits
with
the
idea
that
a
description
of
these
suffices
for
a
perfect
panegyric
but
for
my
part
i
think
one
ought
to
devote
the
greater
part
of
one
s
speech
to
the
virtues
that
were
the
by
which
you
reached
the
height
of
your
achievements
military
exploits
in
most
cases
nay
in
almost
all
are
achieved
with
the
help
of
fortune
the
heavy
infantry
and
cavalry
regiments
but
virtuous
actions
belong
to
the
doer
alone
and
the
praise
that
they
inspire
if
it
be
sincere
belongs
only
to
the
possessor
of
such
virtue
now
having
made
this
distinction
clear
i
will
begin
my
speech

the
rules
of
panegyric
require
that
i
should
mention
your
native
land
no
less
than
your
ancestors
but
i
am
at
a
loss
what
country
i
ought
to
consider
peculiarly
yours
for
countless
nations
have
long
asserted
their
claim
to
be
your
country
the
city
that
rules
over
them
all
was
your
mother
and
nurse
and
in
an
auspicious
hour
delivered
to
you
the
imperial
sceptre
and
therefore
asserts
her
sole
title
to
the
honour
and
that
not
merely
by
resorting
to
the
plea
that
has
prevailed
under
all
the
emperors
i
mean
that
even
if
men
are
born
elsewhere
they
all
adopt
her
constitution
and
use
the
laws
and
customs
that
she
has
promulgated
and
by
that
fact
become
roman
citizens
but
her
claim
is
different
namely
that
she
gave
your
mother
birth
rearing
her
royally
and
as
befitted
the
offspring
who
were
to
be
born
to
her
then
again
the
city
on
the
bosporus
which
is
named
after
the
family
of
the
constantii
though
she
does
not
assert
that
she
is
your
native
place
but
acknowledges
that
she
became
your
adopted
land
by
your
father
s
act
will
think
she
is
cheated
of
her
rights
if
any
orator
should
try
to
deprive
her
of
at
least
this
claim
to
kinship
thirdly
the
illyrians
on
whose
soil
you
were
born
will
not
tolerate
it
if
anyone
assign
you
a
different
fatherland
and
rob
them
of
the
fairest
gift
of
fortune
and
now
i
hear
some
even
of
the
eastern
provinces
protest
that
it
is
unjust
of
me
to
rob
them
of
the
lustre
they
derive
from
you
for
they
say
that
they
sent
forth
your
grandmother
to
be
the
consort
of
your
grandfather
on
the
mother
s
side
almost
all
the
rest
have
hit
on
some
pretension
of
more
or
less
weight
and
are
determined
on
one
ground
or
another
to
adopt
you
for
their
own
therefore
let
that
country
have
the
prize
which
you
yourself
prefer
and
have
so
often
praised
as
the
mother
and
teacher
of
the
virtues
as
for
the
rest
let
each
one
according
to
her
deserts
obtain
her
due
i
should
be
glad
to
praise
them
all
worthy
as
they
are
of
glory
and
honour
but
i
am
afraid
that
my
compliments
however
germane
they
may
seem
to
my
subject
might
on
account
of
their
length
be
thought
inappropriate
to
the
present
occasion
for
this
reason
then
i
think
it
better
to
omit
a
eulogy
of
the
others
but
as
for
rome
your
imperial
majesty
summed
up
her
praises
in
two
words
when
you
called
her
the
teacher
of
virtue
and
by
bestowing
on
her
the
fairest
of
all
encomiums
you
have
forestalled
all
that
others

now
perhaps
i
ought
at
this
point
to
say
a
few
words
about
your
noble
ancestors
only
that
here
too
i
am
at
a
loss
where
to
begin
for
all
your
ancestors
grandfathers
parents
brothers
cousins
and
kinsfolk
were
emperors
who
had
either
acquired
their
power
by
lawful
means
or
were
adopted
by
the
reigning
house
why
should
i
recall
ancient
history
or
hark
back
to
claudius
and
produce
proofs
of
his
merit
which
are
manifest
and
known
to
all
to
what
end
recount
his
campaigns
against
the
barbarians
across
the
danube
or
how
righteously
and
justly
he
won
the
empire
how
plainly
he
lived
while
on
the
throne
how
simple
was
his
dress
as
may
be
seen
to
this
day
in
his
statues
what
i
might
say
about
your
grandparents
is
comparatively
recent
but
equally
remarkable
both
of
them
acquired
the
imperial
sceptre
as
the
reward
of
conspicuous
merit
and
having
assumed
the
command
they
were
on
such
good
terms
with
each
other
and
displayed
such
filial
piety
to
him
who
had
granted
them
a
share
in
the
empire
that
he
used
to
say
that
of
all
the
safeguards
designed
by
him
for
the
realm
and
they
were
many
this
was
his
they
meanwhile
valued
their
mutual
understanding
more
than
undivided
empire
supposing
that
it
could
have
been
bestowed
on
either
of
them
separately
this
was
the
temper
of
their
souls
and
nobly
they
played
their
part
in
action
while
next
to
the
supreme
being
they
reverenced
him
who
had
placed
authority
in
their
hands
with
their
subjects
they
dealt
righteously
and
humanely
and
expelled
the
barbarians
who
had
for
years
settled
in
our
territory
and
had
occupied
it
with
impunity
as
though
it
were
their
own
and
they
built
forts
to
hinder
encroachment
which
procured
for
those
subjects
such
peaceful
relations
with
the
barbarians
as
at
that
period
seemed
to
be
beyond
their
dreams
this
however
is
a
subject
that
deserves
more
than
a
passing
mention
yet
it
would
be
wrong
to
omit
the
strongest
proof
of
their
unanimity
especially
as
it
is
related
to
my
subject
since
they
desired
the
most
perfect
harmony
for
their
children
they
arranged
the
marriage
of
your
father
and
mother
on
this
point
also
i
think
i
must
say
a
few
words
to
show
that
virtue
was
bequeathed
to
you
as
well
as
a
throne
but
why
waste
time
in
telling
how
your
father
on
his
father
s
death
became
emperor
both
by
the
choice
of
the
deceased
monarch
and
by
the
vote
of
all
the
armies
his
military
genius
was
made
evident
by
his
achievements
and
needs
no
words
of
mine
he
traversed
the
whole
civilised
world
suppressing
tyrants
but
never
those
who
ruled
by
right
his
subjects
he
inspired
with
such
affection
that
his
veterans
still
remember
how
generous
he
was
with
largess
and
other
rewards
and
to
this
day
worship
him
as
though
he
were
a
god
as
for
the
mass
of
the
people
in
town
and
country
alike
they
prayed
that
your
father
might
be
victorious
over
the
tyrants
not
so
much
because
they
would
be
delivered
from
that
oppression
as
because
they
would
then
be
governed
by
him
but
when
he
had
made
his
power
supreme
he
found
that
the
tyrant
s
greed
had
worked
like
a
drought
with
the
result
that
money
was
very
scarce
while
there
were
great
hoards
of
treasure
in
the
recesses
of
the
palace
so
he
unlocked
its
doors
and
on
the
instant
flooded
the
whole
country
with
wealth
and
then
in
less
than
ten
years
he
founded
and
gave
his
name
to
a
city
that
as
far
surpasses
all
others
as
it
is
itself
inferior
to
rome
and
to
come
second
to
rome
seems
to
me
a
much
greater
honour
than
to
be
counted
first
and
foremost
of
all
cities
beside
here
it
may
be
proper
to
mention
athens
the
illustrious
seeing
that
during
his
whole
life
he
honoured
her
in
word
and
deed
he
who
was
emperor
and
lord
of
all
did
not
disdain
the
title
of
general
of
the
athenians
and
when
they
gave
him
a
statue
with
an
inscription
to
that
effect
he
felt
more
pride
than
if
he
had
been
awarded
the
highest
honours
to
repay
athens
for
this
compliment
he
bestowed
on
her
annually
a
gift
of
many
tens
of
thousands
of
bushels
of
wheat
so
that
while
she
enjoyed
plenty
he
won
applause
and
reverence
from
the
best
of
men

your
father
s
achievements
were
many
and
brilliant
some
i
have
just
mentioned
and
others
i
must
omit
for
the
sake
of
brevity
but
the
most
notable
of
all
as
i
make
bold
to
say
and
i
think
all
will
agree
was
that
he
begat
reared
and
educated
you
this
secured
to
the
rest
of
the
world
the
advantages
of
good
government
and
that
not
for
a
limited
time
but
for
a
period
beyond
his
own
lifetime
as
far
as
this
is
possible
at
any
rate
your
father
seems
still
to
be
on
the
throne
this
is
more
than
cyrus
himself
could
achieve
when
he
died
his
son
proved
far
inferior
so
that
while
men
called
cyrus
father
his
successor
was
called
but
you
are
even
less
stern
than
your
father
and
surpass
him
in
many
respects
as
i
well
know
and
will
demonstrate
in
my
speech
as
occasion
shall
arise
yet
in
my
opinion
he
should
have
the
credit
of
this
as
well
since
it
was
he
who
gave
you
that
admirable
training
concerning
which
i
shall
presently
speak

not

your
mother
s
ancestry
was
so
distinguished
her
personal
beauty
and
nobility
of
character
were
such
that
it
would
be
hard
to
find
her
match
among
women
i
have
heard
that
saying
of
the
persians
about
parysatis
that
no
other
woman
had
been
the
sister
mother
wife
and
daughter
of
kings
parysatis
however
was
own
sister
of
her
husband
since
their
law
does
not
forbid
a
persian
to
marry
his
sister
but
your
mother
while
in
accordance
with
our
laws
she
kept
pure
and
unsullied
those
ties
of
kinship
was
actually
the
daughter
of
one
emperor
the
wife
of
another
the
sister
of
a
third
and
the
mother
not
of
one
emperor
but
of
several
of
these
one
aided
your
father
in
his
war
against
the
tyrants
another
conquered
the
getae
and
secured
for
us
a
lasting
peace
with
them
the
third
kept
our
frontiers
safe
from
the
enemy
s
incursions
and
often
led
his
forces
against
them
in
person
so
long
at
least
as
he
was
permitted
by
those
who
were
so
soon
punished
for
their
crimes
against
him
though
by
the
number
and
brilliance
of
their
achievements
they
have
indeed
earned
our
homage
and
though
all
the
blessings
of
fortune
were
theirs
in
abundance
yet
in
the
whole
tale
of

now
as
for
heavenly
voices
and
prophecies
and
visions
in
dreams
and
all
such
portents
as
are
common
gossip
when
men
like
yourself
have
achieved
brilliant
and
conspicuous
success
cyrus
for
instance
and
the
founder
of
our
capital
and
alexander
philip
s
son
and
the
like
i
purposely
ignore
them
indeed
i
feel
that
poetic
license
accounts
for
them
all
and
it
is
foolish
even
to
state
that
at
the
hour
of
your
birth
all
the
circumstances
were
brilliant
and
suited
to
a
prince
and
now
the
time
has
come
for
me
to
speak
of
your
education
as
a
boy
you
were
of
course
bound
to
have
the
princely
nurture
that
should
train
your
body
to
be
strong
muscular
healthy
and
handsome
and
at
the
same
time
duly
equip
your
soul
with
courage
justice
temperance
and
wisdom
but
this
can
not
result
from
that
loose
indulgence
which
naturally
pampers
body
and
soul
weakening
men
s
wills
for
facing
danger
and
their
bodies
for
work
therefore
your
body
required
training
by
suitable
gymnastics
while
you
adorned
your
mind
by
literary
studies
but
i
must
speak
at
greater
length
about
both
branches
of
your
education
since
it
laid
the
foundation
of
your
later
career
in
your
physical
training
you
did
not
pursue
those
exercises
that
fit
one
merely
for
public
display
what
professional
athletes
love
to
call
the
pink
of
condition
you
thought
unsuitable
for
a
king
who
must
enter
for
contests
that
are
not
such
a
one
must
put
up
with
very
little
sleep
and
scanty
food
and
that
of
no
precise
quantity
or
quality
or
served
at
regular
hours
but
such
as
can
be
had
when
the
stress
of
work
allows
and
so
you
thought
you
ought
to
train
yourself
in
athletics
with
a
view
to
this
and
that
your
exercises
must
be
military
and
of
many
kinds
dancing
and
running
in
heavy
armour
and
riding
all
these
you
have
continued
from
early
youth
to
practise
at
the
right
time
and
in
every
exercise
you
have
attained
to
greater
perfection
than
any
other
hoplite
usually
a
hoplite
who
is
a
good
infantryman
can
not
ride
or
if
he
is
an
expert
horseman
he
shirks
marching
on
foot
to
battle
but
of
you
alone
it
can
be
said
that
you
can
put
on
the
cavalry
uniform
and
be
a
match
for
the
best
of
them
and
when
changed
into
a
hoplite
show
yourself
stronger
swifter
and
lighter
on
your
feet
than
all
the
rest
then
you
practised
shooting
at
a
mark
that
even
your
hours
of
leisure
might
not
be
hours
of
ease
or
be
found
without
the
exercise
of
arms
so
by
work
that
was
voluntary
you
trained
your
body
to
stand
the
exertions
that
you
would
be
compelled
to
undertake
your
mind
meanwhile
was
trained
by
practice
in
public
speaking
and
other
studies
suitable
to
your
years
but
it
was
not
to
be
wholly
without
the
discipline
of
experience
nor
was
it
for
you
to
listen
merely
to
lectures
on
the
virtues
as
though
they
were
ballads
or
saga
stories
and
so
wait
all
that
time
without
actual
acquaintance
with
brave
works
and
undertakings
plato
that
noble
philosopher
advised
that
boys
should
be
furnished
as
it
were
with
wings
for
flight
by
being
mounted
on
horseback
and
should
then
be
taken
into
battle
so
that
they
may
be
spectators
of
the
warfare
in
which
they
must
soon
be
combatants
this
i
make
bold
to
say
was
in
your
father
s
mind
when
he
made
you
governor
and
king
of
the
celtic
tribes
while
you
were
still
a
youth
or
rather
a
mere
boy
in
point
of
years
though
in
intelligence
and
endurance
you
could
already
hold
your
own
with
men
of
parts
your
father
wisely
provided
that
your
experience
of
war
should
be
free
from
risks
having
arranged
that
the
barbarians
should
maintain
peace
with
his
subjects
but
he
instigated
them
to
internal
feuds
and
civil
war
and
so
taught
you
strategy
at
the
expense
of
their
lives
and
fortunes
this
was
a
safer
policy
than
the
wise
plato
s
for
by
his
scheme
if
the
invading
army
were
composed
of
infantry
the
boys
could
indeed
be
spectators
of
their
fathers
prowess
or
if
need
arose
could
even
take
part
but
supposing
that
the
enemy
won
in
a
cavalry
engagement
then
on
the
instant
one
would
have
to
devise
some
means
to
save
the
boys
which
would
be
difficult
indeed
but
to
inure
the
boys
to
face
the
enemy
while
the
hazard
belongs
to
others
is
to
take
counsel
that
both
suffices
for
their
need
and
also
secures
their
safety

it
was
in
this
way
then
that
you
were
first
trained
in
manliness
but
as
regards
wisdom
that
nature
with
which
you
were
endowed
was
your
sufficing
guide
but
also
i
think
the
wisest
citizens
were
at
your
disposal
and
gave
you
lessons
in
statecraft
moreover
your
intercourse
with
the
barbarian
leaders
in
that
region
gave
you
an
acquaintance
at
first
hand
with
the
manners
laws
and
usages
of
foreigners
indeed
when
homer
set
out
to
prove
the
consummate
wisdom
of
odysseus
he
called
him
and
said
that
he
had
come
to
know
the
minds
of
many
peoples
and
visited
their
cities
so
that
he
might
choose
what
was
best
in
every
one
and
be
able
to
mix
with
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
yes
even
odysseus
who
never
ruled
an
empire
needed
experience
of
the
many
and
divers
minds
of
men
how
much
more
necessary
that
one
who
was
being
brought
up
to
guide
an
empire
like
this
should
not
fit
himself
for
the
task
in
some
modest
dwelling
apart
neither
should
he
like
young
cyrus
in
his
games
play
at
being
emperor
nor
give
audiences
to
his
playmates
as
they
say
cyrus
did
rather
he
ought
to
mix
with
nations
and
peoples
and
give
orders
to
his
troops
definitely
indicating
what
is
to
be
done
and
generally
he
should
be
found
wanting
in
none
of
those
things
which
when
he
comes
to
manhood
he
must
perform
without
fear

accordingly
when
you
had
gained
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
celts
you
crossed
to
the
other
continent
and
were
given
sole
command
against
the
parthians
and
medes
there
were
already
signs
that
a
war
was
smouldering
and
would
soon
burst
into
flame
you
therefore
quickly
learned
how
to
deal
with
it
and
as
though
you
took
as
model
the
hardness
of
your
weapons
steeled
yourself
to
bear
the
heat
of
the
summer
season
i
have
heard
say
that
alcibiades
alone
among
all
the
greeks
was
naturally
so
versatile
that
when
he
cast
in
his
lot
with
the
spartans
he
copied
the
restraint
of
the
lacedaemonians
then
in
turn
theban
and
thracian
manners
and
finally
adopted
persian
luxury
but
alcibiades
when
he
changed
his
country
changed
his
character
too
and
became
so
tainted
with
perversity
and
so
that
he
was
likely
to
lose
utterly
all
that
he
was
born
to
you
however
thought
it
your
duty
to
maintain
your
severity
of
life
wherever
you
might
be
and
by
hard
work
inuring
your
constitution
to
change
you
easily
bore
the
march
inland
from
galatia
to
parthia
more
easily
in
fact
than
a
rich
man
who
lives
now
here
now
there
according
to
the
season
would
bear
it
if
he
were
forced
to
encounter
unseasonable
weather
i
think
heaven
smiled
on
you
and
willed
that
you
should
govern
the
whole
world
and
so
from
the
first
trained
you
in
virtue
and
was
your
guide
when
you
journeyed
to
all
points
and
showed
you
the
bounds
and
limits
of
the
whole
empire
the
character
of
each
region
the
vastness
of
your
territory
the
power
of
every
race
the
number
of
the
cities
the
characteristics
of
the
masses
and
above
all
the
vast
number
of
things
that
one
who
is
bred
to
so
great
a
kingship
can
not
afford
to
neglect
but
i
nearly
forgot
to
mention
the
most
important
thing
of
all
from
a
boy
you
were
taught
to
govern
this
great
empire
but
a
better
thing
you
learned
to
be
governed
submitting
yourself
to
the
authority
that
is
the
best
in
the
world
and
the
most
just
that
is
to
say
nature
and
law
i
mean
that
both
as
son
and
subject
you
obeyed
your
father
indeed
had
he
been
only
your
father
or
only
your
king
obedience
was
his
due
now
what
rearing
and
education
for
a
king
could
one
find
in
history
better
than
this
consider
the
greeks
not
thus
did
the
spartans
train
the
heracleidae
though
they
are
thought
to
have
enjoyed
the
best
form
of
government
that
of
their
kings
as
for
the
barbarians
not
even
the
carthaginians
though
they
were
particularly
by
their
kings
chose
the
best
method
of
training
their
future
rulers
the
moral
discipline
and
the
studies
prescribed
by
their
laws
were
pursued
by
all
alike
as
though
the
citizens
were
brothers
all
destined
both
to
govern
and
be
governed
and
in
the
matter
of
education
they
made
no
difference
between
their
princes
and
the
rest
of
the
citizens
yet
surely
it
is
foolish
to
demand
superlative
excellence
from
one
s
rulers
when
one
takes
no
pains
to
make
them
better
than
other
men
among
the
barbarians
indeed
no
man
is
debarred
from
winning
the
throne
so
one
can
excuse
them
for
giving
the
same
moral
training
to
all
but
that
lycurgus
who
tried
to
make
the
dynasty
of
the
heracleidae
proof
against
all
shocks
should
not
have
arranged
for
them
a
special
education
better
than
that
of
other
spartan
youths
is
an
omission
for
which
he
may
well
be
criticised
he
may
have
thought
that
all
the
lacedaemonians
ought
to
enter
the
race
for
virtue
and
foster
it
but
for
all
that
it
was
wrong
to
provide
the
same
nurture
and
education
for
private
citizens
as
for
those
who
were
to
govern
the
inevitable
familiarity
little
by
little
steals
into
men
s
souls
and
breeds
contempt
for
their
betters
though
for
that
matter
they
are
not
in
any
sense
one
s
betters
unless
it
was
their
own
merit
that
earned
them
the
right
to
rule
this
in
my
opinion
is
the
reason
why
the
spartan
kings
often
found
their
subjects
hard
to
govern
in
proof
of
what
i
say
one
might
quote
the
rivalry
of
lysander
and
agesilaus
and
many
other
instances
if
one
should
review
the
history
of
the
spartan
kings

the

polity
however
by
securing
a
satisfactory
development
of
the
moral
qualities
in
their
kings
even
if
it
gave
them
a
training
in
no
way
different
from
that
of
the
crowd
at
least
endowed
them
with
the
attributes
of
men
but
as
for
the
carthaginians
there
was
nothing
to
admire
even
in
the
discipline
that
they
all
shared
the
parents
turned
their
sons
out
of
doors
and
bade
them
win
the
necessaries
of
life
by
their
own
efforts
with
the
injunction
to
do
nothing
that
is
considered
disgraceful
the
effect
of
this
was
not
to
uproot
the
evil
inclinations
of
the
young
but
to
require
them
to
take
pains
not
to
be
caught
in
doing
for
it
is
not
only
that
ruins
character
but
the
lack
of
mere
necessaries
may
produce
the
same
result
this
is
true
at
any
rate
in
the
case
of
those
whose
reason
has
not
yet
assumed
the
power
to
decide
being
swayed
by
physical
needs
and
persuaded
by
desire
it
is
especially
true
when
one
fails
to
control
the
passion
for
if
from
boyhood
one
is
accustomed
to
it
and
to
the
trading
and
bartering
of
the
this
business
unfit
for
a
youth
of
gentle
birth
to
mention
or
so
much
as
hear
spoken
of
whether
the
youth
finds
it
out
for
himself
or
learns
it
from
those
of
greater
experience
leaves
many
scars
on
the
soul
and
even
a
respectable
citizen
ought
to
be
free
from
all
this
not
a
king

general

it
is
not
for
me
to
criticise
the
carthaginians
in

place
i
will
only
point
out
how
different
was
your
education
and
how
you
profited
by
it
and
have
come
to
excel
in
looks
strength
justice
and
temperance
by
your
active
life
you
achieved
perfect
health
your
temperance
was
the
result
of
obedience
to
the
laws
you
enjoy
a
body
of
unusual
strength
by
reason
of
your
and
a
soul
of
unusual
rectitude
because
of
your
physical
powers
of
endurance
you
left
nothing
undone
to
improve
your
natural
talents
but
ever
acquired
new
talents
by
new
studies
you
needed
nothing
yourself
but
gave
assistance
to
others
and
lavished
such
generous
gifts
that
the
recipients
seemed
as
rich
as
the
monarch
of
the
lydians
though
you
indulged
yourself
less
in
the
good
things
that
were
yours
than
the
most
austere
of
the
spartans
you
gave
others
the
means
of
luxury
in
abundance
while
those
who
preferred
temperance
could
imitate
your
example
as
a
ruler
you
were
mild
and
humane
as
your
father
s
subject
you
were
ever
as
modest
as
any
one
of
his
people
all
this
was
true
of
you
in
boyhood
and
youth
and
much
more

which
there

now
no

had
decreed
the
ending
of
your

s

heaven
had
granted
that

should
be

you
adorned
his
tomb
not
only
by
lavishing
on
it
splendid
decorations
and
so
paying
the
debt
of
gratitude
for
your
birth
and
education
but
still
more
by
the
fact
that
you
alone
of
his
sons
hastened
to
him

he
was
still
alive

stricken
by
illness

paid
him
the

possible
honours

all

i
need
only
mention
in

for

it

your

cry

you

you
displayed

critical

of
affairs
you
could
not
in

prevent

from
going
astray

your

brave
generous

you
maintained

but
i
must
postpone
the
description
of
your
personal
qualities
and
go
on
to
speak
of
your
achievements
the
persians
in
the
past
conquered
the
whole
of
asia
subjugated
a
great
part
of
europe
and
had
embraced
in
their
hopes
i
may
almost
say
the
whole
inhabited
world
when
the
macedonians
deprived
them
of
their
supremacy
and
they
provided
alexander
s
generalship
with
a
task
or
rather
with
a
toy
but
they
could
not
endure
the
yoke
of
slavery
and
no
sooner
was
alexander
dead
than
they
revolted
from
his
successors
and
once
more
opposed
their
power
to
the
macedonians
and
so
successfully
that
when
we
took
over
what
was
left
of
the
macedonian
empire
we
counted
them
to
the
end
as
foes
with
whom
we
must
reckon
i
need
not
now
remind
you
of
ancient
history
of
antony
and
crassus
who
were
generals
with
the
fullest
powers
or
tell
how
after
dangers
we
succeeded
in
wiping
out
the
disgrace
they
incurred
and
how
many
a
prudent
general
retrieved
their
blunders
nor
need
i
recall
the
second
chapter
of
our
misfortunes
and
the
exploits
of
carus
that
followed
when
after
those
failures
he
was
appointed
general
among
those
who
sat
on
the
throne
before
your
father
s
time
and
imposed
on
the
persians
conditions
of
peace
admired
and
welcomed
by
all
did
not
the
caesar
incur
a
disgraceful
defeat
when
he
attacked
them
on
his
own
account
it
was
not
till
the
ruler
of
the
whole
world
turned
his
attention
to
them
directing
thither
all
the
forces
of
the
empire
occupying
all
the
passes
with
his
troops
and
levies
of
hoplites
both
veterans
and
new
recruits
and
employing
every
sort
of
military
equipments
that
fear
drove
them
to
accept
terms
of
peace
that
peace
they
somehow
contrived
to
disturb
and
break
during
your
father
s
lifetime
but
they
escaped
punishment
at
his
hands
because
he
died
in
the
midst
of
preparations
for
a
campaign
it
was
left
for
you
later
on
to
punish
them
for
their
audacity
i
shall
often
have
to
speak
of
your
campaigns
against
them
but
this
one
thing
i
ask
my
hearers
to
observe
you
became
master
of
a
third
of
the
empire
that
part
in
fact
which
seemed
by
no
means
strong
enough
to
carry
on
a
war
since
it
had
neither
arms
nor
troops
in
the
field
nor
any
of
those
military
resources
which
ought
to
flow
in
abundantly
in
preparation
for
so
important
a
war
then
too
your
brothers
for
whatever
reason
did
nothing
to
make
the
war
easier
for
you
and
yet
there
is
no
sycophant
so
shameless
and
so
envious
as
not
to
admit
that
the
harmony
existing
between
you
was
mainly
due
to
you
the
war
in
itself
presented
peculiar
difficulties
in
my
opinion
and
the
troops
were
disaffected
owing
to
the
change
of
government
they
raised
the
cry
that
they
missed
their
old
leader
and
they
wished
to
control
your
actions
nay
more
a
thousand
strange
and
perplexing
circumstances
arose
on
every
hand
to
render
your
hopes
regarding
the
war
more
difficult
to
realise
the
armenians
our
ancient
allies
revolted
and
no
small
part
of
them
went
over
to
the
persians
and
overran
and
raided
the
country
on
their
borders
in
this
crisis
there
seemed
to
be
but
one
hope
of
safety
that
you
should
take
charge
of
affairs
and
plan
the
campaign
but
at
the
moment
this
was
impossible
because
you
were
in
paeonia
making
treaties
with
your
brothers
thither
you
went
in
person
and
so
managed
that
you
gave
them
no
opening
for
criticism
indeed
i
almost
forgot
to
mention
the
very
first
of
your
achievements
the
noblest
of
all
or
at
any
rate
equal
to
the
noblest
for
there
is
no
greater
proof
of
your
prudence
and
magnanimity
than
the
fact
that
in
planning
for
interests
of
such
importance
you
thought
it
no
disadvantage
if
you
should
of
your
own
free
will
concede
the
lion
s
share
to
your
brothers
imagine
for
instance
a
man
dividing
among
his
brothers
their
father
s
estate
of
a
hundred
talents
or
if
you
prefer
twice
as
much
then
suppose
him
to
have
been
content
with
fifty
minae
less
than
the
others
and
to
raise
no
objection
because
he
secured
their
goodwill
in
exchange
for
that
trifling
sum
you
would
think
he
deserved
all
praise
and
respect
as
one
who
had
a
soul
above
money
as
sighted
in
short
as
a
man
of
honour
but
here
is
one
whose
policy
with
regard
to
the
empire
of
the
world
seems
to
have
been
so
high
minded
so
prudent
that
without
increasing
the
burdens
of
administration
he
willingly
gave
up
some
of
the
imperial
revenues
in
order
to
secure
harmony
and
peace
among
all
roman
citizens
what
praise
such
a
one
deserves
and
certainly
one
can
not
in
this
connection
quote
the
saying
well
done
but
a
bad
nothing
in
my
opinion
can
be
called
a
good
bargain
if
it
be
not
honourable
as
well
in
general
if
anyone
wish
to
apply
the
test
of
expediency
alone
he
ought
not
to
make
money
his
criterion
or
reckon
up
his
revenues
from
estates
like
those
old
misers
whom
writers
of
comedy
bring
on
to
the
stage
but
he
should
take
into
account
the
vastness
of
the
empire
and
the
point
of
honour
involved
if
the
emperor
had
disputed
about
the
boundaries
and
taken
a
hostile
attitude
he
might
have
obtained
more
than
he
did
but
he
would
have
governed
only
his
allotted
share
but
he
scorned
and
despised
such
trifles
and
the
result
was
that
he
really
governed
the
whole
world
in
partnership
with
his
brothers
but
had
the
care
of
his
own
portion
only
and
while
he
kept
his
dignity
unimpaired
he
had
less
than
his
share
of
the
toil
and
trouble
that
go
with
such
a
position

a
chance
later
to
speak
in
more
detail
this
is
perhaps
the
right
moment
to
describe
how
you
controlled
the
situation
encompassed
as
you
were
after
your
father
s
death
by
so
many
perils
and
difficulties
of
all
an
unavoidable
war
numerous
hostile
raids
allies
in
revolt
lack
of
discipline
in
the
garrisons
and
all
the
other
harassing
conditions
of
the
hour
you
concluded
in
perfect
harmony
the
negotiations
with
your
brothers
and
when
the
time
had
arrived
that
demanded
your
aid
for
the
dangerous
crisis
of
affairs
you
made
forced
marches
and
immediately
after
leaving
paeonia
appeared
in
syria
but
to
relate
how
you
did
this
would
tax
my
powers
of
description
and
indeed
for
those
who
know
the
facts
their
own
experience
is
enough
but
who
in
the
world
could
describe
adequately
how
at
the
prospect
of
your
arrival
everything
was
changed
and
improved
all
at
once
so
that
we
were
set
free
from
the
fears
that
hung
over
us
and
could
entertain
brighter
hopes
than
ever
for
the
future
even
before
you
were
actually
on
the
spot
the
mutiny
among
the
garrisons
ceased
and
order
was
restored
the
armenians
who
had
gone
over
to
the
enemy
at
once
changed
sides
again
for
you
ejected
from
the
country
and
sent
to
rome
those
who
were
responsible
for
the
governor
s
exile
and
you
secured
for
the
exiles
a
safe
return
to
their
own
country
you
were
so
merciful
to
those
who
now
came
to
rome
as
exiles
and
so
kind
in
your
dealings
with
those
who
returned
from
exile
with
the
governor
that
the
former
did
indeed
bewail
their
misfortune
in
having
revolted
but
still
were
better
pleased
with
their
present
condition
than
with
their
previous
usurpation
while
the
latter
who
were
formerly
in
exile
declared
that
the
experience
had
been
a
lesson
in
prudence
but
that
now
they
were
receiving
a
worthy
reward
for
their
loyalty
on
the
returned
exiles
you
lavished
such
magnificent
presents
and
rewards
that
they
could
not
even
resent
the
good
fortune
of
their
bitterest
enemies
nor
begrudge
their
being
duly
honoured
all
these
difficulties
you
quickly
settled
and
then
by
means
of
embassies
you
turned
the
marauding
arabs
against
our
enemies
then
you
began
preparations
for
the
war
about
which

the
previous
period
of
peace
had
relaxed
the
labours
of
the
troops
and
lightened
the
burdens
of
those
who
had
to
perform
public
services
but
the
war
called
for
money
provisions
and
supplies
on
a
vast
scale
and
even
more
it
demanded
endurance
energy
and
military
experience
on
the
part
of
the
troops
in
the
almost
entire
absence
of
all
these
you
personally
provided
and
organised
everything
drilled
those
who
had
reached
the
age
for
military
service
got
together
a
force
of
cavalry
to
match
the
enemy
s
and
issued
orders
for
the
infantry
to
persevere
in
their
training
nor
did
you
confine
yourself
to
speeches
and
giving
orders
but
yourself
trained
and
drilled
with
the
troops
showed
them
their
duty
by
actual
example
and
straightway
made
them
experts
in
the
art
of
war
then
you
discovered
ways
and
means
not
by
increasing
the
tribute
or
the
extraordinary
contributions
as
the
athenians
did
in
their
day
when
they
raised
these
to
double
or
even
more
you
were
content
i
understand
with
the
original
revenues
except
in
cases
where
for
a
short
time
and
to
meet
an
emergency
it
was
necessary
that
the
people
should
find
their
services
to
the
state
more
expensive
the
troops
under
your
leadership
were
abundantly
supplied
yet
not
so
as
to
cause
the
satiety
that
leads
to
insolence
nor
on
the
other
hand
were
they
driven
to
insubordination
from
lack
of
necessaries
i
shall
say
nothing
about
your
great
array
of
arms
horses
and
engines
of
war
and
the
like
but
when
all
was
ready
and
the
time
had
come
to
make
appropriate
use
of
all
that
i
have
mentioned
the
tigris
was
bridged
by
rafts
at
many
points
and
forts
were
built
to
guard
the
river
meanwhile
the
enemy
never
once
ventured
to
defend
their
country
from
plunder
and
every
useful
thing
that
they
possessed
was
brought
in
to
us
this
was
partly
because
they
were
afraid
to
offer
battle
partly
because
those
who
were
rash
enough
to
do
so
were
punished
on
the
spot
this
is
a
mere
summary
of
your
invasions
of
the
enemy
s
country
who
indeed
in
a
short
speech
could
do
justice
to
every
event
or
reckon
up
the
enemy
s
disasters
and
our
successes
but
this
at
least
i
have
space
to
tell
you
often
crossed
the
tigris
with
your
army
and
spent
a
long
time
in
the
enemy
s
country
but
you
always
returned
crowned
with
the
laurels
of
victory
then
you
visited
the
cities
you
had
freed
and
bestowed
on
them
peace
and
plenty
all
possible
blessings
and
all
at
once
thus
at
your
hands
they
received
what
they
had
so
long
desired
the
defeat
of
the
barbarians
and
the
erection
of
trophies
of
victory
over
the
treachery
and
cowardice
of
the
parthians
treachery
they
had
displayed
when
they
violated
the
treaties
and
broke
the
peace
cowardice
when
they
lacked
the
courage
to
fight
for
their
country
and
all
that
they
held
dear

lest
anyone
should
suppose
that
while
i
delight
in
recalling
exploits
like
these
i
avoid
mentioning
occasions
when
luck
gave
the
enemy
the
rather
it
was
the
nature
of
the
ground
combined
with
opportunity
that
turned
the
that
i
do
so
because
they
brought
us
no
honour
or
glory
but
only
disgrace
i
will
try
to
give
a
brief
account
of
those
incidents
also
not
adapting
my
narrative
with
an
eye
to
my
own
interests
but
preferring
the
truth
in
every
case
for
when
a
man
deliberately
sins
against
the
truth
he
can
not
escape
the
reproach
of
flattery
and
moreover
he
inflicts
on
the
object
of
his
panegyric
the
appearance
of
not
deserving
the
praise
that
he
receives
on
other
accounts
this
is
a
mistake
of
which
i
shall
beware
indeed
my
speech
will
make
it
clear
that
in
no
case
has
fiction
been
preferred
to
the
truth
now
i
am
well
aware
that
all
would
say
that
the
battle
we
fought
before
singara
was
a
most
important
victory
for
the
barbarians
but
i
should
answer
and
with
justice
that
this
battle
inflicted
equal
loss
on
both
armies
but
proved
also
that
your
valour
could
accomplish
more
than
their
luck
and
that
although
the
legions
under
you
were
violent
and
reckless
men
and
were
not
accustomed
like
the
enemy
to
the
climate
and
the
stifling
heat
i
will
relate
exactly
what
took
place
it
was
still
the
height
of
summer
and
the
legions
mustered
long
before
noon
since
the
enemy
were
awestruck
by
the
discipline
accoutrements
and
calm
bearing
of
our
troops
while
to
us
they
seemed
amazing
in
numbers
neither
side
began
the
battle
for
they
shrank
from
coming
to
close
quarters
with
forces
so
well
equipped
while
we
waited
for
them
to
begin
so
that
in
all
respects
we
might
seem
to
be
acting
rather
in
and
not
to
be
responsible
for
beginning
hostilities
after
the
peace
but
at
last
the
leader
of
the
barbarian
army
raised
high
on
their
shields
perceived
the
magnitude
of
our
forces
drawn
up
in
line
what
a
change
came
over
him
what
exclamations
he
uttered
he
cried
out
that
he
had
been
betrayed
that
it
was
the
fault
of
those
who
had
persuaded
him
to
go
to
war
and
decided
that
the
only
thing
to
be
done
was
to
flee
with
all
speed
and
that
one
course
alone
would
secure
his
safety
namely
to
cross
before
we
could
reach
it
the
river
which
is
the
ancient
between
that
country
and
ours
with
this
purpose
he
first
gave
the
signal
for
a
retreat
in
good
order
then
gradually
increasing
his
pace
he
finally
took
to
headlong
flight
with
only
a
small
following
of
cavalry
and
left
his
whole
army
to
the
leadership
of
his
son
and
the
friend
in
whom
he
had
most
confidence
when
our
men
saw
this
they
were
enraged
that
the
barbarians
should
escape
all
punishment
for
their
audacious
conduct
and
clamoured
to
be
led
in
pursuit
chafed
at
your
order
to
halt
and
ran
after
the
enemy
in
full
armour
with
their
utmost
energy
and
speed
for
of
your
generalship
they
had
had
no
experience
so
far
and
they
could
not
believe
that
you
were
a
better
judge
than
they
of
what
was
expedient
moreover
under
your
father
they
had
fought
many
battles
and
had
always
been
victorious
a
fact
that
tended
to
make
them
think
themselves
invincible
but
they
were
most
of
all
elated
by
the
terror
that
the
parthians
now
shewed
when
they
thought
how
they
had
fought
not
only
against
the
enemy
but
against
the
very
nature
of
the
ground
and
if
any
greater
obstacle
met
them
from
some
fresh
quarter
they
felt
that
they
would
overcome
it
as
well
accordingly
they
ran
at
full
speed
for
about
one
hundred
stades
and
only
halted
when
they
came
up
with
the
parthians
who
had
fled
for
shelter
into
a
fort
that
they
had
lately
built
to
serve
as
a
camp
it
was
by
this
time
evening
and
they
engaged
battle
forthwith
our
men
at
once
took
the
fort
and
slew
its
defenders
once
inside
the
fortifications
they
displayed
great
bravery
for
a
long
time
but
they
were
by
this
time
fainting
with
thirst
and
when
they
found
cisterns
of
water
inside
they
spoiled
a
glorious
victory
and
gave
the
enemy
a
chance
to
retrieve
their
defeat
this
then
was
the
issue
of
that
battle
which
caused
us
the
loss
of
only
three
or
four
of
our
men
whilst
the
parthians
lost
the
heir
to
the
throne
who
had
previously
been
taken
prisoner
together
with
all
his
escort
while
all
this
was
going
on
of
the
leader
of
the
barbarians
not
even
the
ghost
was
to
be
seen
nor
did
he
stay
his
flight
till
he
had
put
the
river
behind
him
you
on
the
other
hand
did
not
take
off
your
armour
for
a
whole
day
and
all
the
night
now
sharing
the
struggles
of
those
who
were
getting
the
upper
hand
now
giving
prompt
and
efficient
aid
to
those
who
were
pressed
and
by
your
bravery
and
fortitude
you
so
changed
the
face
of
the
battle
that
at
break
of
day
the
enemy
were
glad
to
beat
a
safe
retreat
to
their
own
territory
and
even
the
wounded
escorted
by
you
could
retire
from
the
battle
thus
did
you
relieve
them
all
from
the
risks
of
flight
now
what
fort
was
taken
by
the
enemy
what
city
did
they
besiege
what
military
supplies
did
they
capture
that
should
give
them
something
to
boast
about
after
the
war

is
a
man
a
skilful
pilot
because
he
can
steer
his
ship
in
fair
weather
when
the
sea
is
absolutely
calm
would
you
call
a
charioteer
an
expert
driver
who
on
smooth
and
level
ground
has
in
harness
horses
that
are
gentle
quiet
and
swift
and
under
such
conditions
gives
a
display
of
his
art
how
much
more
skilful
is
the
pilot
who
marks
and
perceives
beforehand
the
coming
storm
and
tries
to
avoid
its
path
and
then
if
for
any
reason
he
must
face
it
brings
off
his
ship
safe
and
sound
cargo
and
all
just
so
the
skilful
charioteer
is
he
who
can
contend
against
the
unevenness
of
the
ground
and
guide
his
horses
and
control
them
at
the
same
time
if
they
grow
restive
in
short
it
is
not
fair
to
judge
of
skill
of
any
sort
when
it
is
aided
by
fortune
but
one
must
examine
it
independently
cleon
was
not
a
better
general
than
nicias
because
he
was
fortunate
in
the
affair
of
pylos
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
all
whose
success
is
due
to
luck
rather
than
to
good
judgment
but
if
i
did
not
claim
that
your
fortune
was
both
better
and
better
deserved
than
that
of
your
opponents
or
rather
of
all
men
i
should
with
reason
be
thought
to
do
it
an
injustice
since
it
prevented
the
enemy
from
even
perceiving
their
advantage
for
in
my
opinion
an
impartial
judge
of
my
narrative
ought
to
ascribe
our
reverse
to
the
extreme
and
insupportable
heat
and
the
fact
that
you
inflicted
loss
on
the
enemy
equal
to
ours
he
would
regard
as
achieved
by
your
valour
but
that
though
they
were
aware
of
their
losses
they
took
no
account
of
their
success
he
would
regard
as
brought
about
by
your
good
fortune

to
describe
next
the
multitude
of
difficulties
that
beset
us
the
magnitude
of
our
perils
and
how
you
faced
them
all
and
not
only
routed
the
numerous
following
of
the
usurpers
but
the
barbarian
forces
as
well
about
six
years
had
passed
since
the
war
i
have
just
described
and
the
winter
was
nearly
over
when
a
messenger
arrived
with
the
news
that
galatia
had
gone
over
to
the
usurper
that
a
plot
had
been
made
to
assassinate
your
brother
and
had
been
carried
out
also
that
italy
and
sicily
had
been
occupied
lastly
that
the
illyrian
garrisons
were
in
revolt
and
had
proclaimed
their
general
emperor
though
for
a
time
he
had
been
inclined
to
resist
what
seemed
to
be
the
irresistible
onset
of
the
usurpers
indeed
he
himself
kept
imploring
you
to
send
money
and
men
to
his
aid
as
though
he
were
terribly
afraid
on
his
own
account
of
being
overpowered
by
them
and
for
a
while
he
kept
protesting
that
he
would
do
his
duty
that
for
his
part
he
had
no
pretensions
to
the
throne
but
would
faithfully
guard
and
protect
it
for
you
such
were
his
assertions
but
it
was
not
long
before
his
treachery
came
to
light
and
he
received
his
punishment
tempered
though
it
was
with
mercy
on
learning
these
facts
you
thought
you
ought
not
to
waste
your
time
in
idleness
to
no
purpose
the
cities
of
syria
you
stocked
with
engines
of
war
garrisons
food
supplies
and
equipment
of
other
kinds
considering
that
by
these
measures
you
would
though
absent
sufficiently
protect
the
inhabitants
while
you
were
planning
to
set
out
in
person
against
the
usurpers

but
the
persians
ever
since
the
last
campaign
had
been
watching
for
just
such
an
opportunity
and
had
planned
to
conquer
syria
by
a
single
invasion
so
they
mustered
all
forces
every
age
sex
and
condition
and
marched
against
us
men
and
mere
boys
old
men
and
crowds
of
women
and
slaves
who
followed
not
merely
to
assist
in
the
war
but
in
vast
numbers
beyond
what
was
needed
for
it
was
their
intention
to
reduce
the
cities
and
once
masters
of
the
country
to
bring
in
colonists
in
spite
of
us
but
the
magnitude
of
your
preparations
made
it
manifest
that
their
expectations
were
but
vanity
they
began
the
siege
and
completely
surrounded
the
city
with
dykes
and
then
the
river
mygdonius
flowed
in
and
flooded
the
ground
about
the
walls
as
they
say
the
nile
floods
egypt
the
were
brought
up
against
the
ramparts
on
boats
and
their
plan
was
that
one
force
should
sail
to
attack
the
walls

slain
in

by

me
did
i
desire
to
recount
all
this
in
detail
it
is
enough
that
you
should
hear
the
sum
of
the
matter
on
that
day
the
sun
beheld
a
battle
the
like
of
which
no
man
had
ever
known
before
these
events
exposed
the
historic
boastings
of
the
medes
as
only
empty
conceit
till
then
men
had
hardly
believed
that
xerxes
could
have
had
so
huge
an
armament
seeing
that
for
all
its
size
its
fate
was
so
shameful
and
ignominious
but
these
events
made
the
fact
clearer
to
us
than
things
long
familiar
and
obvious
xerxes
tried
to
sail
and
to
march
by
fighting
against
the
laws
of
nature
and
as
he
thought
overcame
the
nature
of
the
sea
and
of
the
dry
land
but
he
proved
to
be
no
match
for
the
wisdom
and
endurance
of
a
greek
whose
soldiers
had
not
been
bred
in
the
school
of
luxury
nor
learned
to
be
slaves
but
knew
how
to
obey
and
to
use
their
energies
like
men
that
man
however
though
he
had
no
such
vast
armament
as
xerxes
was
even
more
insensate
and
outdid
the
aloadae
in
his
infatuation
as
if
almost
he
had
conceived
the
idea
of
overwhelming
the
city
with
the
mountain
that
was
hard
by
then
he
turned
the
currents
of
rivers
against
its
walls
and
undermined
them
but
even
when
the
city
had
lost
its
walls
he
could
not
succeed
in
taking
it
so
that
he
had
not
even
that
triumph
to
boast
of
as
xerxes
had
when
he
set
fire
to
athens
so
after
spending
four
months
he
retreated
with
an
army
that
had
lost
many
thousands
and
he
who
had
always
seemed
to
be
irresistible
was
glad
to
keep
the
peace
and
to
use
as
a
bulwark
for
his
own
safety
the
fact
that
you
had
no
time
to
spare
and
that
our
own
affairs
were
in
confusion

such
were
the
trophies
and
victories
that
you
left
behind
you
in
asia
and
you
led
your
troops
to
europe
in
perfect
condition
determined
to
fill
the
whole

with
the
monuments
of
your
victories
even
if
i
had
nothing
more
wonderful
to
relate
about
you
what
i
have
said
is
enough
to
demonstrate
that
in
good
sense
and
energy
you
surpass
all
those
in
the
past
whose
fortune
was
the
same
as
yours
indeed
to
have
repulsed
the
whole
strength
of
persia
and
remain
unscathed
not
to
have
lost
so
much
as
a
soldier
from
the
ranks
much
less
a
town
or
fort
and
finally
to
have
brought
the
siege
to
so
brilliant
and
unprecedented
a
conclusion
achievement
i
ask
in
the
past
could
one
compare
with
this
the
carthaginians
were
famous
for
their
daring
in
the
face
of
danger
but
they
ended
in
disaster
the
siege
of
plataea
shed
lustre
on
its
citizens
but
all
that
their
valour
could
do
for
those
unhappy
men
was
to
make
their
misfortunes
more
widely
known
what
need
to
quote
messene
or
pylos
since
there
the
defeated
did
not
make
a
brave
defence
nor
was
a
vigorous
assault
necessary
to
subdue
them
as
for
the
syracusans
they
had
their
famous
man
of
science
to
aid
them
against
the
armaments
of
rome
and
our
illustrious
general
but
what
did
he
avail
them
in
the
end
did
they
not
fall
more
ignominiously
than
the
rest
and
were
only
spared
to
be
a
glorious
monument
of
their
conqueror
s
clemency
but
if
i
wished
to
reckon
up
all
the
states
that
could
not
withstand
armaments
inferior
to
their
own
how
many
volumes
do
you
think
would
suffice
rome
however
i
ought
perhaps
to
mention
because
long
ago
she
had
just
such
a
fortune
i
mean
when
the
galatians
and
celts
conspired
together
and
without
warning
poured
down
on
the
city
like
a
winter
torrent
the
citizens
occupied
the
famous
hill
on
which
stands
the
statue
of
jupiter
there
they
intrenched
themselves
with
wicker
barricades
and
such
like
defences
as
though
with
a
wall
while
the
enemy
offered
no
hindrance
nor
ventured
to
approach
to
attack
at
close
quarters
and
so
they
won

it
is
with

that
the
recent
one
may
well
be
compared
at

in
the
issue
of
its
fortunes
for
the
actual
occurrences
could
not
be
paralleled
in
all
history
for
who
ever
heard
of
surrounding
a
city
with
water
and
from
without
throwing
hills
about
it
like
nets
then
hurling
at
it
like
a
a
river
that
flowed
in
a
steady
stream
and
broke
against
its
walls
or
of
fighting
like
that
which
took
place
in
the
water
and
about
the
wall
where
it
had
fallen
in
for
my
purpose
this
is
as
i
said
evidence
enough
but
what
remains
to
tell
is
far
more
and
perhaps
since
i
have
undertaken
to
record
as
far
as
possible
all
that
you
accomplished
it
is
not
fair
to
break
off
my
narrative
at
the
point
where
you
were
at
the
very
height
of
your
activity
for
even
while
you
were
occupied
by
the
interests
i
have
just
described
you
arranged
your
affairs
in
europe
despatching
embassies
spending
money
and
sending
out
the
legions
that
were
garrisoning
paeonia
against
the
scythians
all
of
which
was
with
the
intention
of
preventing

no
sooner
had
you
set
out
for
the
seat
of
war
than
this
very
man
who
had
all
along
protested
that
he
would
loyally
continue
to
guard
your
interests
though
you
had
reinforced
him
with
money
troops
and
everything
of
the
sort
was
driven
to
folly
and
madness
by
i
know
not
what
evil
spirit
and
came
to
terms
with
the
most
execrable
of
mankind
the
common
enemy
of
all
who
care
for
peace
and
cherish
harmony
above
all
things
and
more
particularly
your
enemy
for
personal
reasons
but
you
were
undismayed
by
the
magnitude
of
his
preparations
nor
would
you
admit
that
a
conspiracy
of
traitors
could
overreach
your
own
wise
purpose
one
of
the
pair
you
justly
accused
of
treason
the
other
of
infamous
crimes
besides
and
deeds
of
lawless
violence
and
you
summoned
the
former
to
trial
and
judgment
before
the
legions
the
latter
you
decided
to
leave
to
the
arbitrament
of
war
then
he
met
you
face
to
face
that
honourable
and
prudent
old
man
who
used
to
change
his
opinions
more
easily
than
any
child
and
though
he
had
begged
for
them
forgot
all
your
favours
as
soon
as
the
need
had
passed
he
arrived
with
his
phalanxes
of
hoplites
and
squadrons
of
cavalry
intending
to
compel
if
he
could
not
persuade
you
to
take
no
action
and
return
the
way
you
came
when
then
you
saw
this
man
who
had
protested
that
he
would
continue
to
be
your
ally
and
general
playing
an
enemy
s
part
and
claiming
an
equal
share
of
your
empire
you
were
not
at
all
dismayed
though
his
troops
outnumbered
yours
for
you
had
not
brought
your
whole
force
with
you
since
you
decided
that
to
fight
it
out
with
such
odds
against
you
might
be
courageous
but
was
in
every
way
hazardous
even
if
you
won
the
battle
because
of
that
other
savage
usurper
who
was
lying
in
wait
for
a
favourable
opportunity
when
you
should
be
in
difficulties
you
therefore
made
a
wise
resolve
in
preferring
to
achieve
success
and
you
mounted
the
platform
with
him
who
for
the
moment
was
your
colleague
in
empire
he
was
escorted
by
a
whole
host
of
hoplites
with
glittering
weapons
presenting
drawn
swords
and
spears
a
sight
to
make
a
coward
shake
with
fear
though
it
inspired
and
supported
one
so
brave
and
gallant
as
yourself
now
when
first
you
began
to
speak
silence
fell
on
the
whole
army
and
every
man
strained
his
ears
to
hear
many
shed
tears
and
raised
their
hands
to
heaven
though
even
this
they
did
in
silence
so
as
to
be
unobserved
some
again
showed
their
affection
in
their
faces
but
all
showed
it
by
their
intense
eagerness
to
hear
your
words
when
your
speech
reached
its
climax
they
were
carried
away
by
enthusiasm
and
burst
into
applause
then
eager
to
miss
no
word
they
became
quiet
again
finally
won
by
your
arguments
they
hailed
you
as
their
only
emperor
demanded
that
you
alone
should
rule
the
whole
empire
and
bade
you
lead
them
against
your
adversary
promising
to
follow
you
and
begging
you
to
take
back
the
imperial
insignia
you
however
thought
it
beneath
you
to
stretch
out
your
hand
for
them
or
to
take
them
by
force
then
against
his
will
and
with
reluctance
but
yielding
at
last
to
what
is
called
thessalian
persuasion
he
took
off
the
purple
robe
and
offered
it
to
you
what
a
heroic
figure
yours
was
then
when
in
a
single
day
you
became
master
of
all
those
races
those
legions
all
that
wealth
when
you
stripped
of
his
power
and
took
prisoner
one
who
if
not
in
fact
yet
in
intention
had
shown
that
he
was
your
enemy

did
you
not
behave
more
nobly
and
more
generously
to
him
than
cyrus
did
to
his
own
grandfather
for
you
deprived
your
enemy
s
followers
of
nothing
but
protected
their
privileges
and
i
understand
gave
many
of
them
presents
besides
who
saw
you
despondent
before
your
triumph
or
unduly
elated
after
it
orator
general
virtuous
emperor
distinguished
soldier
though
men
give
you
all
these
titles
how
can
any
praise
of
ours
be
adequate
long
had
the
orator
s
platform
been
wholly
disconnected
from
the
general
s
functions
and
it
was
reserved
for
you
to
combine
them
once
more
in
your
person
in
this
surely
following
the
example
of
odysseus
and
nestor
and
the
roman
generals
who
sacked
carthage
for
these
men
were
always
even
more
formidable
to
whom
they
attacked
from
the
platform
than
to
the
enemy
in
the
field
of
battle
indeed
i
pay
all
the
homage
due
to
the
forcible
eloquence
of
demosthenes
and
his
imitators
but
when
i
consider
the
conditions
of
your
harangue
i
can
never
admit
that
there
is
any
comparison
between
your
theatre
and
theirs
for
they
never
had
to
address
an
audience
of
hoplites
nor
had
they
such
great
interests
at
stake
but
only
money
or
honour
or
reputation
or
friends
whom
they
had
undertaken
to
assist
yet
when
the
citizens
clamoured
in
dissent
they
often
i
believe
left
the
platform
pale
and
trembling
like
generals
who
prove
to
be
cowards
when
they
have
to
face
the
enemy
in
indeed
from
all
history
it
would
be
impossible
to
cite
an
achievement
as
great
as
yours
when
you
acquired
control
of
all
those
races
by
judicial
pleading
alone
and
moreover
you
had
to
make
out
your
case
against
a
man
not
by
any
means
to
be
despised
as
many
people
think
but
one
who
had
won
distinction
in
many
campaigns
who
was
full
of
years
who
had
the
reputation
of
experience
gained
in
a
long
career
and
had
for
a
considerable
period
been
in
command
of
the
legions
there
present
what
overwhelming
eloquence
that
must
have
been
how
truly
did
persuasion
sit
on
your
lips
and
had
the
power
to
leave
a
sting
in
the
souls
of
that
motley
crowd
of
men
and
to
win
you
a
victory
that
in
importance
rivals
any
that
were
ever
achieved
by
force
of
arms
only
that
yours
was
stainless
and
unalloyed
and
was
more
like
the
act
of
a
priest
going
to
the
temple
of
his
god
than
of
an
emperor
going
to
war
it
is
true
indeed
that
the
persians
have
a
similar
instance
to
quote
but
it
falls
far
short
of
what
you
did
i
mean
that
on
their
father
s
death
the
sons
of
darius
quarrelled
about
the
succession
to
the
throne
and
appealed
to
justice
rather
than
to
arms
to
arbitrate
their
case
but
between
you
and
your
brothers
there
never
arose
any
dispute
either
in
word
or
deed
nay
not
one
for
it
was
in
fact
more
agreeable
to
you
to
share
the
responsibility
with
them
than
to
be
the
sole
ruler
of
the
world
but
your
quarrel
was
with
one
who
though
his
actions
had
not
so
far
been
impious
or
criminal
was
shown
to
have
a
treasonable
purpose
and
you
brought
proofs
to
make
that
treason
manifest

after

there
followed
a
brilliant
campaign
and
a
war
truly
sacred
though
it
was
not
on

of
sacred
territory
like
the
phocian
war
which
we
are
told
was
waged
in
the
days
of
our
ancestors
but
was
to
avenge
the
laws
and
the
constitution
and
the
slaughter
of
countless
citizens
some
of
whom
the
usurper
had
put
to
death
while
others
he
was
just
about
to
kill
or
was
trying
to
arrest
it
was
really
as
though
he
was
afraid
that
otherwise
he
might
be
considered
for
all
his
vices
a
roman
citizen
instead
of
a
genuine
barbarian
as
for
his
crimes
against
your
house
though
they
were
quite
as
flagrant
as
his
outrages
against
the
state
you
thought
it

you
to
devote
less
attention
to
them

i
need
not
mention
all
the
usurper
s
offences
against
the
community
and
against
individuals
he
assassinated
his
own
master
for
he
had
actually
been
the
slave
of
the
murdered
emperor
s
ancestors
a
miserable
remnant
saved
from
the
spoils
of
germany
and
then
he
aimed
at
ruling
over
us
he
who
had
not
even
the
right
to
call
himself
free
had
you
not
granted
him
the
privilege
those
in
command
of
the
legions
he
imprisoned
and
put
to
death
while
to
the
common
soldiers
he
behaved
with
such
abject
servility
and
deference
that
he
ruined
their
discipline
then
he
enacted
those
fine
laws
of
his
a
property
tax
of
fifty
per
and
threatened
the
disobedient
with
death
while
any
slave
who
pleased
might
inform
against
his
master
then
he
compelled
those
who
did
not
want
it
to
purchase
the
imperial
property
but
time
would
fail
me
were
i
to
tell
of
all
his
crimes
and
of
the
vast
proportions
that
his
tyranny
had
assumed
as
for
the
armament
which
he
had
collected
to
use
against
the
barbarians
but
actually
employed
against
us
who
could
give
you
an
adequate
report
of
its
strength
there
were
celts
and
galatians
who
had
seemed
invincible
even
to
our
ancestors
and
who
had
so
often
like
a
winter
torrent
that
sweeps
all
before
it
poured
down
on
the
italians
and
illyrians
and
following
up
their
repeated
victories
on
the
field
of
battle
had
even
invaded
asia
and
then
became
our
subjects
because
they
had
no
choice
they
had
been
enrolled
in
the
ranks
of
our
armies
and
furnished
levies
that
won
a
brilliant
reputation
being
enlisted
by
your
ancestors
and
later
by
your
father
then
since
they
enjoyed
the
blessings
of
continued
peace
and
their
country
increased
in
wealth
and
population
they
furnished
your
brothers
with
considerable
levies
and
finally
by
compulsion
not
choice
they
all
in
a
body
took
part
in
the
usurper
s
campaign
the
most
enthusiastic
of
his
followers
were
in
virtue
of
their
ties
of
kinship
the
franks
and
saxons
the
most
warlike
of
the
tribes
who
live
beyond
the
rhine
and
on
the
shores
of
the
western
sea
and
since
every
city
and
every
fortified
place
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
was
shorn
of
its
garrison
that
whole
region
was
left
with
no
defence
against
the
barbarians
and
all
that
splendidly
organised
army
was
despatched
against
us
every
town
in
galatia
was
like
a
camp
preparing
for
war
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
weapons
of
war
and
forces
of
cavalry
infantry
archers
and
javelin
men
when
these
allies
of
the
usurper
began
to
pour
into
italy
from
all
quarters
and
there
joined
the
troops
who
had
been
enrolled
long
before
there
was
no
one
so
bold
as
not
to
feel
terror
and
dismay
at
the
tempest
that
threatened
it
seemed
to
all
as
though
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
from
the
alps
a
bolt
that
no
action
could
avert
no
words
describe
it
struck
terror
into
the
illyrians
the
paeonians
the
thracians
the
scythians
the
dwellers
in
asia
believed
it
was
directed
entirely
against
themselves
and
even
the
persians
began
to
get
ready
to
oppose
it
in
their
country
s
defence
but
the
usurper
thought
his
task
was
easy
and
that
he
would
have
little
difficulty
in
baffling
your
wisdom
and
energy
and
already
fixed
his
covetous
gaze
on
the
wealth
of
india
and
the
magnificence
of
persia
to
such
an
excess
of
folly
and
rashness
had
he
come
and
after
a
success
wholly
insignificant
i
mean
the
affair
of
the
scouts
whom
while
they
were
unprotected
by
the
main
army
he
ambushed
and
cut
in
pieces
so
true
it
is
that
when
fools
meet
with
undeserved
success
they
often
find
it
is
but
the
prelude
to
greater
misfortunes
and
so
elated
by
this
stroke
of
luck
he
left
the
fortified
posts
that
protected
the
italian
frontier
and
marched
towards
the
norici
and
the
paeonians
taking
no
precautions
because
he
thought
that
speed
would
serve
him
better
than
force
of
arms
or
courage

you
led
your

out
of
the
narrow
and

passes
and
he
followed
in
pursuit
as
he
thought
unaware
that
he
was
being
outgeneralled
until
you

reached

the

were
in

the

armies
were
drawn
up
on

then
your

kept
the

and
outflanking

left
you
at

indeed

from

first
the
wrong
formation

it
had
been
drawn
up
by

who
knew
nothing

then
he
who
so
far
had
thought
he
was
the
pursuer
did
not
even
join
battle

took
to
headlong
flight
dismayed
by
the
clash
of
weapons
he
could
not
even
listen
without
trembling
when
the
legions
shouted
their
his
ranks
had
been
thrown
into
disorder
but
the
soldiers
formed
into
companies
and
renewed
the
battle
for
they
disdained
to
be

in
flight
and
to
give
an
example
in
their
own
persons
of
what
had
hitherto
been
inconceivable

his
back

the

the

if
defeated

not

to
make

their
retreat
were
resolved
either
to
conquer

not
to

had
severely
punished

extraordinary

stimulated

gave

daring
and
heroism

some

seized

others

the

neither

aided
by

remaining
force
of

spurred
on

charge

by

directed

the
trophy
that
you
set
up
for
that
victory
was
far
more
brilliant
than
your
father
s
he
led
an
army
that
had
always
proved
itself
invincible
and
with
it
conquered
a
miserable
old
man
but
the
tyranny
that
you
suppressed
was
flourishing
and
had
reached
its
height
partly
through
the
crimes
that
had
been
committed
but
still
more
because
so
many
of
the
youth
were
on
that
side
and
you
took
the
field
against
it
with
legions
that
had
been
trained
by
yourself
what
emperor
can
one
cite
in
the
past
who
first
planned
and
then
reproduced
so
admirable
a
type
of
cavalry
and
such
accoutrements
first
you
trained
yourself
to
wear
them
and
then
you
taught
others
how
to
use
such
weapons
so
that
none
could
withstand
them
this
is
a
subject
on
which
many
have
ventured
to
speak
but
they
have
failed
to
do
it
justice
so
much
so
that
those
who
heard
their
description
and
later
had
the
good
fortune
to
see
for
themselves
decided
that
their
eyes
must
accept
what
their
ears
had
refused
to
credit
your
cavalry
was
almost
unlimited
in
numbers
and
they
all
sat
their
horses
like
statues
while
their
limbs
were
fitted
with
armour
that
followed
closely
the
outline
of
the
human
form
it
covers
the
arms
from
wrist
to
elbow
and
thence
to
the
shoulder
while
a
coat
of
mail
protects
the
shoulders
back
and
breast
the
head
and
face
are
covered
by
a
metal
mask
which
makes
its
wearer
look
like
a
glittering
statue
for
not
even
the
thighs
and
legs
and
the
very
ends
of
the
feet
lack
this
armour
it
is
attached
to
the
cuirass
by
fine
like
a
web
so
that
no
part
of
the
body
is
visible
and
uncovered
for
this
woven
covering
protects
the
hands
as
well
and
is
so
flexible
that
the
wearers
can
bend
even
their
fingers
all
this
i
desire
to
represent
in
words
as
vividly
as
i
can
but
it
is
beyond
my
powers
and
i
can
only
ask
those
who
wish
to
know
more
about
this
armour
to
see
it
with
their
own
eyes
and
not
merely
to
listen
to
my
description

λόγους
now
that
i
have
told
the
story
of
this
first
campaign
which
was
fought
at
the
end
of
the
autumn
shall
i
here
break
off
my
narrative
or
is
it
altogether
unfair
to
withhold
the
end
and
issue
of
your
achievements
from
those
who
are
eager
to
hear
winter
overtook
us
and
gave
the
usurper
a
chance
to
escape
punishment
then
followed
a
splendid
proclamation
worthy
of
your
imperial
generosity
an
amnesty
was
granted
to
those
who
had
taken
sides
with
the
usurper
except
when
they
had
shared
the
guilt
of
those
infamous
murders
thus
they
who
had
never
hoped
even
to
see
again
anything
that
they
held
dear
recovered
their
houses
money
and
native
land
then
you
welcomed
the
fleet
which
arrived
from
italy
bringing
thence
many
citizens
who
no
doubt
had
fled
from
the
usurper
s
savage
cruelty
then
when
the
occasion
demanded
that
you
should
take
the
field
you
again
menaced
the
usurper
he
however
took
cover
in
the
fastnesses
of
italy
and
hid
his
army
away
there
in
the
mountains
fashion
and
never
even
dared
to
carry
on
the
war
beneath
the
open
heavens
but
he
betook
himself
to
the
neighbouring
town
which
is
devoted
to
pleasure
and
high
living
and
spent
his
time
in
public
shows
and
sensual
pleasures
believing
that
the
impassable
mountains
alone
would
suffice
for
his
safety
moreover
intemperate
as
he
was
by
nature
he
thought
it
clear
gain
to
be
able
to
indulge
his
appetites
at
so
dangerous
a
crisis
and
he
evidently
placed
too
much
confidence
in
the
safety
of
his
position
because
the
town
is
cut
off
from
that
part
of
italy
by
a
natural
rampart
of
mountains
except
the
half
that
is
bounded
by
a
shoaling
sea
which
resembles
the
marshes
of
egypt
and
makes
that
part
of
the
country
inaccessible
even
to
an
invading
fleet
it
seems
however
as
though
nature
herself
will
not
devise
any
safeguard
for
the
sensual
and
cowardly
against
the
temperate
and
brave
for
when
prudence
and
courage
advance
hand
in
hand
she
makes
everything
give
way
before
them
long
since
she
revealed
to
us
those
arts
through
which
we
have
attained
an
abundance
of
what
was
once
thought
to
be
unattainable
and
in
the
field
of
individual
effort
we
see
that
what
seemed
impossible
for
many
working
together
to
achieve
can
be
accomplished
by
a
prudent
man
and
since
by
your
own
actions
you
demonstrated
this
fact
it
is
only
fair
o
my
emperor
that
you
should
accept
my
words
to
that
effect

ὦ
πάντα
ἀγαθὴ
πρόνοια
for
you
conducted
the
campaign
under
the
open
skies
and
that
though
there
was
a
city
of
some
importance
near
at
hand
and
moreover
you
encouraged
your
men
to
work
hard
and
to
take
risks
not
merely
by
giving
orders
but
by
your
own
personal
example
you
discovered
a
path
hitherto
unknown
to
all
and
you
sent
forward
a
strong
detachment
of
hoplites
chosen
from
your
whole
army
then
when
you
had
ascertained
that
they
had
come
up
with
the
enemy
you
led
forward
your
army
in
person
surrounded
them
and
defeated
his
whole
force
this
happened
before
dawn
and
before
noon
the
news
was
brought
to
the
usurper
he
was
attending
a
at
a
festival
and
was
expecting
nothing
of
what
took
place
how
his
attitude
changed
what
was
his
decision
about
the
crisis
how
he
abandoned
the
town
and
in
fact
all
italy
and
fled
thus
beginning
to
expiate
his
murders
and
all
his
earlier
crimes
it
is
not
for
this
speech
to
relate
yet
though
the
respite
he
gained
was
so
brief
he
proceeded
to
act
no
less
wickedly
than
in
the
past
so
true
is
it
that
by
the
sufferings
of
the
body
alone
it
is
impossible
for
the
wicked
to
cleanse
their
souls
of
evil
for
when
he
reached
galatia
this
ruler
who
was
so
righteous
and
so
far
surpassed
his
own
former
cruelty
that
he
now
bethought
himself
of
all
the
ruthless
and
brutal
modes
of
punishment
that
he
had
then
overlooked
and
derived
the
most
exquisite
pleasure
from
the
spectacle
of
the
sufferings
of
the
wretched
citizens
he
would
bind
them
alive
to
chariots
and
letting
the
teams
gallop
would
order
the
drivers
to
drag
them
along
while
he
stood
by
and
gazed
at
their
sufferings
in
fact
he
spent
his
whole
time
in
amusements
of
this
sort
until
like
an
olympic
victor
you
threw
him
in
the
third
encounter
and
forced
him
to
pay
a
fitting
penalty
for
his
infamous
career
namely
to
thrust
into
his
own
breast
that
very
sword
which
he
had
stained
with
the
slaughter
of
so
many
citizens
never
in
my
opinion
was
there
a
punishment
more
suitable
or
more
just
than
this
nor
one
that
gave
greater
satisfaction
to
the
whole
human
race
which
was
now
really
liberated
from
such
cruelty
and
harshness
and
at
once
began
to
exult
in
the
good
government
that
we
enjoy
to
this
day
long
may
we
continue
to
enjoy
it

would

every

of
your
achievements
but
you
will
with
reason
pardon
me
most
mighty
emperor
if
i
fall
short
of
that
ambition
and
omit
to
mention
the
naval
armament
against
carthage
which
was
equipped
in
egypt
and
set
sail
from
italy
to
attack
her
and
also
your
conquest
of
the
pyrenees
against
which
you
sent
an
army
by
sea
and
your
successes
against
the
barbarians
which
of
late
have
been
so
frequent
and
all
such
successes
in
the
past
as
have
not
become
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
for
example
i
often
hear
that
even
antioch
now
calls
herself
by
your
name
her
existence
she
does
indeed
owe
to
her
founder
but
her
present
wealth
and
increase
in
every
sort
of
abundance
she
owes
to
you
since
you
provided
her
with
harbours
that
offer
good
anchorage
for
those
who
put
in
there
for
till
then
it
was
considered
a
dangerous
risk
even
to
sail
past
antioch
so
full
were
all
the
waters
of
that
coast
up
to
the
very
shores
of
rocks
and
sunken
reefs
i
need
not
stop
to
mention
the
porticoes
fountains
and
other
things
of
the
kind
that
you
caused
to
be
bestowed
on
antioch
by
her
governors
as
to
your
benefactions
to
the
city
of
your
ancestors
you
built
round
it
a
wall
that
was
then
only
begun
and
all
buildings
that
seemed
to
be
unsound
you
restored
and
made
safe
for
all
time
but
how
could
one
reckon
up
all
these
things
time
will
fail
me

the
time
has
now
come
when
it
is
proper
to
consider
whether
your
career
so
far
as
i
have
described
it
is
at
every
point
in
harmony
with
virtue
and
the
promptings
of
a
noble
disposition
for
to
this
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
my
speech
i
think
it
right
to
pay
special
attention
let
me
therefore
mention
once
more
what
i
said
some
time
ago
that
to
your
father
you
were
dutiful
and
affectionate
and
that
you
constantly
maintained
friendly
relations
with
your
brothers
for
your
father
you
were
ever
willing
to
obey
and
as
the
colleague
of
your
brothers
in
the
empire
you
always
displayed
moderation
and
if
anyone
thinks
this
a
trifling
proof
of
merit
let
him
consider
the
case
of
alexander
the
son
of
philip
and
cyrus
the
son
of
cambyses
and
then
let
him
applaud
your
conduct
for
alexander
while
still
a
mere
boy
showed
clearly
that
he
would
no
longer
brook
his
father
s
control
while
cyrus
dethroned
his
grandfather
yet
no
one
is
so
foolish
as
to
suppose
that
since
you
displayed
such
modesty
and
control
towards
your
father
and
brothers
you
were
not
fully
equal
to
alexander
and
cyrus
in
greatness
of
soul
and
ambition
for
glory
for
when
fortune
offered
you
the
opportunity
to
claim
as
your
right
the
empire
of
the
world
you
were
the
first
to
make
the
essay
though
there
were
many
who
advised
otherwise
and
tried
to
persuade
you
to
the
contrary
course
accordingly
when
you
had
carried
through
the
war
that
you
had
in
hand
and
that
with
the
utmost
ease
and
so
as
to
ensure
safety
for
the
future
you
resolved
to
liberate
that
part
of
the
empire
which
had
been
occupied
by
the
enemy
and
the
reason
that
you
assigned
for
going
to
war
was
most
just
and
such
as
had
never
before
arisen
namely
your
detestation
of
those
infamous
men
civil
war
one
could
not
call
it
for
its
leader
was
a
barbarian
who
had
proclaimed
himself
emperor
and
elected
himself
general
i
dislike
to
speak
too
often
of
his
evil
deeds
and
the
crimes
that
he
committed
against
your
house
but
could
anything
be
more
heroic
than
your
line
of
action
for
should
you
fail
in
your
undertaking
the
risk
involved
was
obvious
but
you
faced
it
and
you
were
not
bidding
for
gain
nay
nor
for
undying
renown
for
whose
sake
brave
men
so
often
dare
even
to
die
selling
their
lives
for
glory
as
though
it
were
gold
nor
was
it
from
desire
of
wider
or
more
brilliant
empire
for
not
even
in
your
youth
were
you
ambitious
of
that
but
it
was
because
you
were
in
love
with
the
abstract
beauty
of
such
an
achievement
and
thought
it
your
duty
to
endure
anything
rather
than
see
a
barbarian
ruling
over
roman
citizens
making
himself
master
of
the
laws
and
constitution
and
offering
public
prayers
for
the
common
weal
guilty
as
he
was
of
so
many
impious
crimes
and
murders
who
could
fail
to
be
dazzled
by
the
splendour
of
your
armament
and
the
vast
scale
of
your
expenditure
and
yet
i
am
told
that
xerxes
when
he
mustered
all
asia
against
the
greeks
spent
no
less
than
ten
years
in
preparing
for
that
war
then
he
set
out
with
twelve
hundred
triremes
from
the
very
spot
as
i
understand
where
you
gathered
your
fleet
together
having
built
it
in
rather
less
than
ten
months
and
yet
you
had
more
ships
than
xerxes
but
neither
his
fortune
nor
his
achievements
can
properly
be
compared
with
yours

i
fear
that
it
is
beyond
my
powers
to
describe
the
magnificence
of
your
outlay
for
other
purposes
nor
will
i
risk
being
tedious
by
staying
now
to
count
up
the
sums
you
bestowed
on
cities
that
had
long
been
destitute
for
whereas
in
the
time
of
your
predecessors
they
lacked
the
necessaries
of
life
they
have
all
become
rich
through
you
and
the
general
prosperity
of
each
city
increases
the
welfare
of
every
private
household
in
it
but
it
is
proper
that
i
should
mention
your
gifts
to
private
persons
and
give
you
the
title
of
a
generous
and
emperor
for
since
there
were
many
who
long
ago
had
lost
their
property
because
in
some
cases
justly
in
others
unjustly
their
ancestral
estates
had
suffered
loss
you
had
no
sooner
come
into
power
than
like
a
just
judge
you
set
right
in
the
latter
cases
the
errors
committed
by
men
in
the
past
and
restored
them
to
the
control
of
their
property
while
in
the
former
cases
you
were
a
kindly
arbiter
and
granted
that
they
should
recover
what
they
had
lost
thinking
that
to
have
suffered
so
long
was
punishment
enough
then
you
lavished
large
sums
from
your
privy
purse
and
increased
the
reputation
for
wealth
of
many
who
even
in
the
past
had
prided
themselves
on
their
large
incomes
but
why
should
i
remind
you
of
all
this
and
seem
to
waste
time
over
trifles
especially
as
it
must
be
obvious
to
all
that
no
king
except
alexander
the
son
of
philip
was
ever
known
to
bestow
such
splendid
presents
on
his
friends
indeed
some
kings
have
thought
that
the
wealth
of
their
friends
gave
more
grounds
for
suspicion
and
alarm
than
did
the
resources
of
their
enemies
while
others
were
jealous
of
the
aristocrats
among
their
subjects
and
therefore
persecuted
the
in
every
possible
way
or
even
exterminated
their
houses
and
thus
were
responsible
for
the
public
disasters
of
their
cities
and
in
private
life
for
the
most
infamous
crimes
there
were
some
who
went
so
far
as
to
envy
mere
physical
advantages
such
as
health
or
good
looks
or
good
condition
and
as
for
a
virtuous
character
among
their
subjects
they
could
not
bear
even
to
hear
of
it
but
counted
it
a
crime
like
murder
or
theft
or
treason
to
appear
to
lay
claim
to
virtue
but
perhaps
someone
will
say
and
with
truth
that
these
were
the
actions
and
practices
not
of
genuine
kings
but
of
base
and
contemptible
tyrants
nay
but
that
other
malady
which
has
been
known
to
attack
not
only
those
who
were
irrational
but
some
even
who
were
just
and
mild
i
mean
the
tendency
to
quarrel
with
friends
who
were
too
prosperous
and
to
wish
to
humble
them
and
deprive
them
of
their
rightful
possessions
who
i
ask
has
ever
dared
so
much
as
to
mention
such
conduct
in
your
case
yet
such
they
say
was
the
treatment
that
cyrus
the
persian
the
king
s
received
from
his
kinsman
who
could
not
brook
the
honour
in
which
cyrus
was
held
by
the
common
people
and
agesilaus
also
is
well
known
to
have
resented
the
honours
paid
to
lysander
by
the
ionians

all
these
then
you
have
surpassed
in
merit
for
you
have
made
their
wealth
more
secure
for
the
rich
than
a
father
would
for
his
own
children
and
you
take
thought
that
your
subjects
shall
be
as
though
you
were
the
founder
and
of
every
single
city
those
to
whom
fortune
has
been
generous
you
still
further
enrich
and
in
many
cases
men
owe
all
their
wealth
to
your
generosity
so
that
in
amount
your
gifts
clearly
surpass
those
of
other
princes
while
in
security
of
ownership
of
what
has
once
been
given
you
cast
into
the
shade
any
favours
bestowed
by
democracies
and
this
is
i
think
very
natural
for
when
men
are
conscious
that
they
lack
certain
advantages
they
envy
those
who
do
possess
them
but
when
a
man
is
more
brilliantly
endowed
by
fortune
than
any
of
his
fellows
and
by
his
own
initiative
has
won
even
higher
dignities
than
fate
had
assigned
him
he
lacks
nothing
and
there
is
none
whom
he
need
envy
and
since
you
realise
that
in
your
case
this
is
especially
true
you
rejoice
at
the
good
fortune
of
others
and
take
pleasure
in
the
successes
of
your
subjects
you
have
already
bestowed
on
them
certain
honours
and
other
honours
you
are
on
the
point
of
bestowing
and
you
are
making
plans
for
the
benefit
of
yet
other
persons
nor
are
you
content
to
award
to
your
friends
the
government
of
a
single
city
or
nation
or
even
of
many
such
with
the
honours
attaching
thereto
but
unless
you
chose
a
colleague
to
share
that
empire
on
whose
behalf
you
had
spared
no
pains
to
exterminate
the
brood
of
usurpers
you
thought
that
no
act
of
yours
could
be
worthy
of
your
former
achievements
that
you
reached
this
decision
not
so
much
because
it
was
necessary
as
because
you
take
pleasure
in
giving
all
that
you
have
to
give
is
i
suppose
well
known
to
all
for
you
chose
no
colleague
to
aid
you
in
your
contests
with
the
usurpers
but
you
thought
it
right
that
one
who
had
not
shared
in
the
toil
should
share
in
the
honour
and
glory
and
that
only
when
all
danger
seemed
to
be
over
and
it
is
well
known
that
from
that
honour
you
subtract
not
even
a
trifling
part
though
you
do
not
demand
that
he
should
share
the
danger
even
in
some
small
degree
except
indeed
when
it
was
necessary
for
a
short
time
that
he
should
accompany
you
on
your
campaign
does
my
account
of
this
call
for
any
further
witnesses
or
proofs
surely
it
is
obvious
that
he
who
tells
the
tale
would
not
be
the
one
to
introduce
a
fictitious
account
but
on
this
part
of
my
subject

must
not
spend
any
more

a
few
words
about
your
temperance
your
wisdom
and
the
affection
that
you
inspired
in
your
subjects
will
not
i
think
be
out
of
place
for
who
is
there
among
them
all
who
does
not
know
that
from
boyhood
you
cultivated
the
virtue
of
temperance
as
no
one
had
ever
done
before
you
that
in
your
youth
you
possessed
that
virtue
your
father
is
a
trustworthy
witness
for
he
entrusted
to
you
alone
the
management
of
affairs
of
state
and
all
that
related
to
your
brothers
although
you
were
not
even
the
eldest
of
his
sons
and
that
you
still
display
it
now
that
you
are
a
man
we
are
all
well
aware
since
you
ever
behave
towards
the
people
and
the
magistrates
like
a
citizen
who
obeys
the
laws
not
like
a
king
who
is
above
the
laws
for
who
ever
saw
you
made
arrogant
by
prosperity
who
ever
saw
you
uplifted
by
those
successes
so
numerous
and
so
splendid
and
so
quickly
achieved
they
say
that
alexander
philip
s
son
when
he
had
broken
the
power
of
persia
not
only
adopted
a
more
ostentatious
mode
of
life
and
an
insolence
of
manner
obnoxious
to
all
but
went
so
far
as
to
despise
the
father
that
begat
him
and
indeed
the
whole
human
race
for
he
claimed
to
be
regarded
as
the
son
of
ammon
instead
of
the
son
of
philip
and
when
some
of
those
who
had
taken
part
in
his
campaigns
could
not
learn
to
flatter
him
or
to
be
servile
he
punished
them
more
harshly
than
the
prisoners
of
war
but
the
honour
that
you
paid
to
your
father
need
i
speak
of
in
this
place
not
only
did
you
revere
him
in
private
life
but
constantly
where
men
were
gathered
together
in
public
you
sang
his
praises
as
though
he
were
a
beneficent
and
as
for
your
friends
you
grant
them
that
honour
not
merely
in
name
but
by
your
actions
you
make
their
title
sure
can
any
one
of
them
i
ask
lay
to
your
charge
the
loss
of
any
right
or
any
penalty
or
injury
suffered
or
any
overbearing
act
either
serious
or
trifling
nay
there
is
not
one
who
could
bring
any
such
accusation
for
your
friends
who
were
far
advanced
in
years
remained
in
office
till
the
appointed
end
of
their
lives
and
only
laid
down
with
life
itself
their
control
of
public
business
and
then
they
handed
on
their
possessions
to
their
children
or
friends
or
some
member
of
their
family
others
again
when
their
strength
failed
for
work
or
military
service
received
an
honourable
discharge
and
are
now
spending
their
last
days
in
prosperity
yet
others
have
departed
this
life
and
the
people
call
them
blessed
in
short
there
is
no
man
who
having
once
been
held
worthy
of
the
honour
of
your
friendship
ever
suffered
any
punishment
great
or
small
even
though
later
he
proved
to
be
vicious
for
them
all
that
he
had
to
do
was
to
depart
and
give
no
further
trouble

your
wisdom
it
is
by
no
means
easy
to
praise
as
it
deserves
but
i
must
say
a
few
words
about
it
your
actions
however
are
more
convincing
i
think
than
my
words
for
it
is
not
likely
that
this
great
and
mighty
empire
would
have
attained
such
dimensions
or
achieved
such
splendid
results
had
it
not
been
directed
and
governed
by
an
intelligence
to
match
indeed
when
it
is
entrusted
to
luck
alone
unaided
by
wisdom
we
may
be
thankful
if
it
last
for
any
length
of
time
it
is
easy
by
depending
on
luck
to
flourish
for
a
brief
space
but
without
the
aid
of
wisdom
it
is
very
hard
or
rather
i
might
say
impossible
to
preserve
the
blessings
that
have
been
bestowed
and
in
short
if
we
need
cite
a
convincing
proof
of
this
we
do
not
lack
many
notable
instances
for
by
wise
counsel
we
mean
the
ability
to
discover
most
successfully
the
measures
that
will
be
good
and
expedient
when
put
into
practice
it
is
therefore
proper
to
consider
in
every
case
whether
this
wise
counsel
may
not
be
counted
as
one
of
the
things
you
have
achieved
certainly
when
there
was
need
of
harmony
you
gladly
gave
way
and
when
it
was
your
duty
to
aid
the
community
as
a
whole
you
declared
for
war
with
the
utmost
readiness
and
when
you
had
defeated
the
forces
of
persia
without
losing
a
single
hoplite
you
made
two
separate
campaigns
against
the
usurpers
and
after
overcoming
one
of
them
by
your
public
harangue
you
added
to
your
army
his
forces
which
were
fresh
and
had
suffered
no
losses
and
finally
by
intelligence
rather
than
by
brute
force
you
completely
subdued
the
other
usurper
who
had
inflicted
so
many
sufferings
on
the
community
i
now
desire
to
speak
more
clearly
on
this
subject
and
to
demonstrate
to
all
what
it
was
that
you
chiefly
relied
on
and
that
secured
you
from
failure
in
every
one
of
those
great
enterprises
to
which
you
devoted
yourself
it
is
your
conviction
that
the
affection
of
his
subjects
is
the
surest
defence
of
an
emperor
now
it
is
the
height
of
absurdity
to
try
to
win
that
affection
by
giving
orders
and
levying
it
as
though
it
were
a
tax
or
tribute
the
only
alternative
is
the
policy
that
you
have
yourself
pursued
i
mean
of
doing
good
to
all
men
and
imitating
the
divine
nature
on
earth
to
show
mercy
even
in
anger
to
take
away
their
harshness
from
acts
of
vengeance
to
display
kindness
and
toleration
to
your
fallen
enemies
this
was
your
practice
this
you
always
commended
and
enjoined
on
others
to
imitate
and
thus
even
while
the
usurper
still
controlled
italy
you
transferred
rome
to
paeonia
by
means
of
the
senate
and
inspired
the
cities
with
zeal
for
undertaking
public
services

as
for
the
affection
of
your
armies
what
description
could
do
it
justice
even
before
the
battle
at
myrsa
a
division
of
cavalry
came
over
to
your
side
and
when
you
had
conquered
italy
bodies
of
infantry
and
distinguished
legions
did
the
same
but
what
happened
in
galatia
shortly
after
the
usurper
s
miserable
end
demonstrated
the
universal
loyalty
of
the
garrisons
to
you
for
when
emboldened
by
his
isolated
position
another
dared
to
assume
the
effeminate
purple
they
suddenly
set
on
him
as
though
he
were
a
wolf
and
tore
him
limb
from
limb
your
behaviour
after
that
deed
your
merciful
and
humane
treatment
of
all
those
of
his
friends
who
were
not
convicted
of
having
shared
his
crimes
and
that
in
spite
of
all
the
sycophants
who
came
forward
with
accusations
and
warned
you
to
show
only
suspicion
against
friends
of
his
this
i
count
as
the
culmination
of
all
virtue
what
is
more
i
maintain
that
your
conduct
was
not
only
humane
and
just
but
prudent
in
a
still
higher
degree
he
who
thinks
otherwise
falls
short
of
a
true
understanding
of
both
the
circumstances
and
your
policy
for
that
those
who
had
not
been
proved
guilty
should
be
protected
was
of
course
just
and
you
thought
you
ought
by
no
means
to
make
friendship
a
reason
for
suspicion
and
so
cause
it
to
be
shunned
seeing
that
it
was
due
to
the
loyal
affection
of
your
own
subjects
that
you
had
attained
to
such
power
and
accomplished
so
much
but
the
son
of
that
rash
usurper
who
was
a
mere
child
you
did
not
allow
to
share
his
father
s
punishment
to
such
a
degree
does
every
act
of
yours
incline
towards
clemency
and

oration
ii
introduction
to
oration
ii
the
second
oration
is
a
panegyric
of
the
emperor
constantius
written
while
julian
after
his
elevation
to
the
rank
of
caesar
was
campaigning
in
gaul
it
closely
resembles
and
often
echoes
the
first
and
was
probably
never
delivered
in
his
detailed
and
forced
analogies
of
the
achievements
of
constantius
with
those
of
the
homeric
heroes
always
to
the
advantage
of
the
former
julian
follows
a
sophistic
practice
that
he
himself
condemns
and
though
he
more
than
once
contrasts
himself
with
the
ingenious
rhetoricians
he
is
careful
to
observe
all
their
rules
even
in
his
historical
descriptions
of
the
emperor
s
campaigns
the
long
platonic
digression
on
virtue
and
the
ideal
ruler
is
a
regular
feature
of
a
panegyric
of
this
type
though
julian
neglects
to
make
the
direct
application
to
constantius
in
the
first
oration
he
quoted
homer
only
once
but
while
the
second
contains
the
usual
comparisons
with
the
persian
monarchs
and
alexander
its
main
object
is
to
prove
by
direct
references
to
the
iliad
that
constantius
surpassed

in
strategy
odysseus
in
eloquence

as
the
poet
tells
us
when
his
wrath
was
kindled
and
he
quarrelled
with
the
king
let
fall
from
his
hands
his
spear
and
shield
then
he
strung
his
harp
and
lyre
and
sang
and
chanted
the
deeds
of
the
making
this
the
pastime
of
his
idle
hours
and
in
this
at
least
he
chose
wisely
for
to
fall
out
with
the
king
and
affront
him
was
excessively
rash
and
violent
but
perhaps
the
son
of
thetis
is
not
free
from
this
criticism
either
that
he
spent
in
song
and
music
the
hours
that
called
for
deeds
though
at
such
a
time
he
might
have
retained
his
arms
and
not
laid
them
aside
but
later
at
his
leisure
he
could
have
sung
the
praises
of
the
king
and
chanted
his
victories
though
indeed
the
author
of
that
tale
tells
us
that
agamemnon
also
did
not
behave
to
his
general
either
temperately
or
with
tact
but
first
used
threats
and
proceeded
to
insolent
acts
when
he
robbed
achilles
of
his
prize
of
valour
then
homer
brings
them
penitent
now
face
to
face
in
the
assembly
and
makes
the
son
of
thetis
exclaim

later
on
he
makes
him
curse
the
cause
of
their
quarrel
and
recount
the
disasters
due
to
his
own
wrath
and
we
see
the
king
blaming
zeus
and
fate
and
erinys
and
here
i
think
he
is
pointing
a
moral
using
those
heroes
whom
he
sets
before
us
like
types
in
a
tragedy
and
the
moral
is
that
kings
ought
never
to
behave
insolently
nor
use
their
power
without
reserve
nor
be
carried
away
by
their
anger
like
a
spirited
horse
that
runs
away
for
lack
of
the
bit
and
the
driver
and
then
again
he
is
warning
generals
not
to
resent
the
insolence
of
kings
but
to
endure
their
censure
with
and
serenely
so
that
their
whole
life
may
not
be
filled
with
remorse

when
i
reflect
on
this
my
beloved
emperor
and
behold
you
displaying
in
all
that
you
do
the
result
of
your
study
of
homer
and
see
you
so
eager
to
benefit
every
citizen
in
the
community
in
every
way
and
devising
for
me
individually
such
honours
and
privileges
one
after
another
then
i
think
that
you
desire
to
be
nobler
than
the
king
of
the
greeks
to
such
a
degree
that
whereas
he
insulted
his
bravest
men
you
i
believe
grant
forgiveness
to
many
even
of
the
undeserving
since
you
approve
the
maxim
of
pittacus
which
set
mercy
before
vengeance
and
so
i
should
be
ashamed
not
to
appear
more
reasonable
than
the
son
of
peleus
or
to
fail
to
praise
as
far
as
in
me
lies
what
appertains
to
you
i
do
not
mean
gold
or
a
robe
of
purple
nay
by
zeus
nor
raiment
embroidered
all
over
the
work
of
sidonian
women
nor
beautiful
nisaean
horses
nor
the
gleam
and
glitter
of
chariots
nor
the
precious
stone
of
india
so
beautiful
and
lovely
to
look
upon
and
yet
if
one
should
choose
to
devote
his
attention
to
these
and
think
fit
to
describe
every
one
of
them
he
would
have
to
draw
on
almost
the
whole
stream
of
homer
s
poetry
and
still
he
would
be
short
of
words
and
the
panegyrics
that
have
been
composed
for
all
the
would
be
inadequate
for
your
sole
praise
first
then
let
me
begin
if
you
please
with
your
sceptre
and
your
sovereignty
itself
for
what
does
the
poet
say
when
he
wishes
to
praise
the
antiquity
of
the
house
of
the
pelopids
and
to
exhibit
the
greatness
of
their
sovereignty

here
then
you
have
the
genealogy
of
the
house
of
pelops
which
endured
for
barely
three
generations
but
the
story
of
our
family
began
with
claudius
then
its
supremacy
ceased
for
a
short
time
till
your
two
grandfathers
succeeded
the
throne
and
your
mother
s
father
governed
rome
and
italy
and
libya
besides
and
sardinia
and
sicily
an
empire
not
inferior
certainly
to
argos
and
mycenae
your
father
s
father
ruled
the
most
warlike
of
all
the
tribes
of
galatia
the
western
iberians
and
the
islands
that
lie
in
the
ocean
which
are
as
much
larger
than
those
that
are
to
be
seen
in
our
seas
as
the
sea
that
rolls
beyond
the
pillars
of
heracles
is
larger
than
the
inner
sea
these
countries
your
grandfathers
entirely
cleared
of
our
foes
now
joining
forces
for
a
campaign
when
occasion
demanded
now
making
separate
expeditions
on
their
own
account
and
so
they
annihilated
the
insolent
and
lawless
barbarians
on
their
frontiers
these
then
are
the
distinctions
that
they
won
your
father
inherited
his
proper
share
of
the
empire
with
all
piety
and
due
observance
waiting
till
his
father
reached
his
appointed
end
then
he
freed
from
intolerable
slavery
the
remainder
which
had
sunk
from
empire
to
tyranny
and
so
governed
the
whole
appointing
you
and
your
brothers
his
three
sons
as
his
colleagues
now
can
i
fairly
compare
your
house
with
the
pelopids
in
the
extent
of
their
power
the
length
of
their
dynasty
or
the
number
of

who
sat

now
which
one
of
those
heroes
to

homer
devotes
his

strains
shall
i
admit
to
be
superior
to
you
there
is
the
archer
pandaros
in
homer
but
he
is
treacherous
and
yields
to
bribes
moreover
his
arm
was
weak
and
he
was
an
inferior
hoplite
then
there
are
besides
teucer
and
meriones
the
latter
employs
his
bow
against
a
pigeon
while
teucer
though
he
distinguished
himself
in
battle
always
needed
a
sort
of
bulwark
or
wall
accordingly
he
keeps
a
shield
in

of
him
and
that
not
his
own
but
his
brother

and
aims
at
the
enemy
at
his
ease
cutting
an
absurd
figure

a
soldier

that
he
needed
a
protector
taller
than
himself
and
that
it
was
not
in
his
weapons
that
he
placed
his
hopes
of
safety
but
i
have
seen
you
many
a
time
my
beloved
emperor
bringing
down
bears
and
panthers
and
lions
with
the
weapons
hurled
by
your
hand
and
using
your
bow
both
for
hunting
and
for
pastime
and
on
the
field
of
battle
you
have
your
own
shield
and
cuirass
and
helmet
and
i
should
not
be
afraid
to

you
with
achilles

as
for
your
horsemanship
and
your
agility
in
running
would
it
be
fair
to
compare
with
you
any
of
those
heroes
of
old
who
won
a
name
and
great
reputation
is
it
not
a
fact
that
horsemanship
had
not
yet
been
invented
for
as
yet
they
used
only
chariots
and
not
and
as
for
their
fastest
runner
it
is
an
open
question
how
he
compares
with
you
but
in
drawing
up
troops
and
forming
a
phalanx
skilfully
menestheus
seems
to
have
excelled
and
on
account
of
his
greater
age
the
pylian
is
his
equal
in
proficiency
but
the
enemy
often
threw
their
line
into
disorder
and
not
even
at
the
wall
could
they
hold
their
ground
when
they
encountered
the
foe
you
however
engaged
in
countless
battles
not
only
with
hostile
barbarians
in
great
numbers
but
with
just
as
many
of
your
own
subjects
who
had
revolted
and
were
fighting
on
the
side
of
one
who
was
ambitious
of
grasping
the
imperial
power
yet
your
phalanx
remained
unbroken
and
never
wavered
or
yielded
an
inch
that
this
is
not
an
idle
boast
and
that
i
do
not
make
a
pretension
in
words
that
goes
beyond
the
actual
facts
i
will
demonstrate
to
my
hearers
for
i
think
it
would
be
absurd
to
relate
to
you
your
own
achievements
i
should
be
like
a
stupid
and
tasteless
person
who
on
seeing
the
works
of
pheidias
should
attempt
to
discuss
with
pheidias
himself
the
maiden
goddess
on
the
acropolis
or
the
statue
of
zeus
at
pisa
but
if
i
publish
to
the
rest
of
the
world
your
most
distinguished
achievements
i
shall
perhaps
avoid
that
blunder
and
not
lay
myself
open
to
criticism
so
i
will
hesitate
no
more

will
object
if
when

attempt

my

should
become

long

that
though
i
desire
to
limit
and
restrain
it
lest
my
feeble
words
overwhelm
and
mar
the
greatness
of
your
deeds
like
the
gold
which
when
it
was
laid
over
the
wings
of
the
eros
at
thespiae
took
something
so
they
say
from
the
delicacy
of
its
workmanship
for
your
triumphs
really
call
for
the
trumpet
of
homer
himself
far
more
than
did
the
achievements
of
the
macedonian
this
will
be
evident
as
i
go
on
to
use
the
same
method
of
argument
which
i
adopted
when
i
began
it
then
became
evident
that
there
is
a
strong
affinity
between
the
emperor
s
exploits
and
those
of
the
heroes
and
i
claimed
that
while
one
hero
excelled
the
others
in
one
accomplishment
only
the
emperor
excels
them
all
in
all
those
accomplishments
that
he
is
more
kingly
than
the
king
himself
i
proved
if
you
remember
in
what
i
said
in
my
introduction
and
again
and
again
it
will
be
evident
but
now
let
us
if
you
please
consider
his
battles
and
campaigns
what
greeks
and
barbarians
did
homer
praise
above
their
fellows
i
will
read
you
those
of
his
verses
that
are
most
to
the
point

these

he
says
were
the
bravest
of
the
greeks
who
came
to
the
war
and
of

trojan
army
hector
and
sarpedon
do
you
wish
then
that
i
should
choose
out
their
most
brilliant
feats
and
consider
what
they
amounted
to
and
in
fact
the
fighting
of
achilles
at
the
river
resembles
in
some
respects
certain
of
the
emperor
s
achievements
and
so
does
the
battle
of
the
achaeans
about
the
wall
or
ajax
again
when
in
his
struggle
to
defend
the
ships
he
goes
up
on
to
their
decks
might
be
allowed
some
just
resemblance
to
him
but
now
i
wish
to
describe
to
you
the
battle
by
the
river
which
the
emperor
fought
not
long
ago
you
know
the
causes
of
the
outbreak
of
the
war
and
that
he
carried
it
through
not
from
desire
of
gain
but
with
justice
on
his
side
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
briefly
remind
you
of
the
facts

to
grasp
at
power
to

he
had
no

and
assassinated
the
emperor
s
brother
and
partner
in
empire
then
he
began
to
be
uplifted
and
dazzled
by
his
hopes
as
though
he
was
about
to
imitate
poseidon
and
to
prove
that
homer
s
story
was
not
mere
fiction
but
absolutely
true
where
he
says
about
the
god

for
nothing
stood
in
his
way
but
all
things
stood
aside
and
made
a
path
for
him
in
their
joy
even
so
the
usurper
thought
that
he
had
left
behind
him
nothing
hostile
or
opposed
to
him
and
that
there
was
nothing
at
all
to
hinder
him
from
taking
up
a
position
at
the
mouth
of
the
tigris
and
there
followed
him
a
large
force
of
heavy
infantry
and
as
many
cavalry
yes
and
good
fighters
they
were
celts
iberians
and
germans
from
the
banks
of
the
rhine
and
from
the
coasts
of
the
western
sea
whether
i
ought
to
call
that
sea
the
ocean
or
the
atlantic
or
whether
it
is
proper
to
use
some
other
name
for
it
i
am
not
sure
i
only
know
that
its
coasts
are
peopled
by
tribes
of
barbarians
who
are
not
easy
to
subdue
and
are
far
more
energetic
than
any
other
race
and
i
know
it
not
merely
from
hearsay
on
which
it
is
never
safe
to
rely
but
i
have
learned
it
from
personal
experience
from
these
tribes
then
he
mustered
an
army
as
large
as
that
which
marched
with
him
from
home
or
rather
many
followed
him
because
they
were
his
own
people
allied
to
him
by
the
ties
of
race
but
our
so
we
must
call
mean
all
his
roman
troops
followed
from
compulsion
and
not
from
choice
like
mercenary
allies
and
their
position
and
was
like
that
of
the
proverbial
carian
since
they
were
naturally
to
a
barbarian
and
a
stranger
who
had
conceived
the
idea
of
ruling
and
embarked
on
the
enterprise
at
the
time
of
a
drunken
debauch
and
was
the
sort
of
leader
that
one
might
expect
from
such
a
preface
and
prelude
as
that
he
led
them
in
person
not
indeed
like
typho
who
as
the
poet
tells
us
in
his
wonder
tale
was
brought
forth
by
the
earth
in
her
anger
against
zeus
nor
was
he
like
the
strongest
of
the
giants
but
he
was
like
that
vice
incarnate
which
the
wise
prodicus
created
in
his
fable
making
her
compete
with
virtue
and
attempt
to
win
over
the
son
of
zeus
contending
that
he
would
do
well
to
prize
her
above
all
else
and
as
he
led
them
to
battle
he
outdid
the
behaviour
of
capaneus
like
the
barbarian
that
he
was
in
his
insensate
folly
though
he
did
not
like
capaneus
trust
to
the
energy
of
his
soul
or
his
physical
strength
but
to
the
numbers
of
his
barbarian
followers
and
he
boasted
that
he
would
lay
everything
at
their
feet
to
plunder
that
every
general
and
captain
and
common
soldier
of
his
should
despoil
an
enemy
of
corresponding
rank
of
his
baggage
and
belongings
and
that
he
would
enslave
the
owners
as
well
he
was
confirmed
in
this
attitude
by
the
emperor
s
clever
strategy
and
led
his
army
out
from
the
narrow
passes
to
the
plains
in
high
spirits
and
little
knowing
the
truth
since
he
decided
that
the
emperor
s
march
was
merely
flight
and
not
a
manoeuvre
thus
he
was
taken
unawares
like
a
bird
or
fish
in
the
net
for
when
he
reached
the
open
country
and
the
plains
of
paeonia
and
it
seemed
advantageous
to
fight
it
out
there
then
and
not
before
the
emperor
drew
up
his
cavalry
separately
on
both
wings

was
the
repentance
of

the

surpassed
the

but
what
i
must
now
state
is
that
the
man
who
had
trained
and
tutored
the
usurper
was
neither
among
the
fallen
nor
the
fugitives
it
was
indeed
natural
that
he
should
not
even
hope
for
pardon
since
his
schemes
had
been
so
wicked
his
actions
so
infamous
and
he
had
been
responsible
for
the
slaughter
of
so
many
innocent
men
and
women
of
whom
many
were
private
citizens
and
of
almost
all
who
were
connected
with
the
imperial
family
and
he
had
done
this
not
with
shrinking
nor
with
the
sentiments
of
one
who
sheds
the
blood
of
his
own
people
and
because
of
that
stain
of
guilt
fears
and
is
on
the
watch
for
the
avenger
and
those
who
will
exact
a
bloody
reckoning
but
with
a
kind
of
purification
that
was
new
and
unheard
of
he
would
wash
his
hands
of
the
blood
of
his
first
victims
and
then
go
on
to
murder
man
after
man
and
then
after
those
whom
they
held
dear
he
slew
the
women
as
well
so
he
naturally
abandoned
the
idea
of
appealing
for
mercy
but
likely
as
it
is
that
he
should
think
thus
yet
it
may
well
be
otherwise
for
the
fact
is
that
we
do
not
know
what
he
did
or
suffered
before
he
vanished
out
of
sight
out
of
our
ken
whether
some
avenging
deity
snatched
him
away
as
homer
says
of
the
daughters
of
pandareos
and
even
now
is
carrying
him
to
the
very
verge
of
the
world
to
punish
him
for
his
evil
designs
or
whether
the
river
has
received
him
and
bids
him
feed
the
fishes
has
not
yet
been
revealed
for
till
the
battle
actually
began
and
while
the
troops
were
forming
the
phalanx
he
was
full
of
confidence
and
went
to
and
fro
in
the
centre
of
their
line
but
when
the
battle
was
ended
as
was
fitting
he
vanished
completely
taken
from
our
sight
by
i
know
not
what
god
or
supernatural
agency
only
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
fate
in
store
for
him
was
far
from
enviable
at
any
rate
he
was
not
destined
to
appear
again
and
after
insulting
us
with
impunity
live
prosperous
and
secure
as
he
thought
he
should
but
he
was
doomed
to
be
completely
blotted
out
and
to
suffer
a
punishment
that
for
him
indeed
was
fatal
but
to
many
was
beneficial
and
gave
them
a
chance
of
recovery

now
though
it
would
be
well
worth
while
to
devote
more
of
my
speech
to
this
man
who
was
the
author
of
that
whole
enterprise
yet
it
breaks
the
thread
of
my
narrative
which
had
reached
the
thick
of
the
action
so
i
must
leave
that
subject
for
the
present
and
going
back
to
the
point
where
i
digressed
describe
how
the
battle
ended
for
though
their
generals
showed
such
cowardice
the
courage
of
the
soldiers
was
by
no
means
abated
when
their
line
was
broken
which
was
due
not
to
their
cowardice
but
to
the
ignorance
and
inexperience
of
their
leader
they
formed
into
companies
and
kept
up
the
fight
and
what
happened
then
was
beyond
all
expectation
for
the
enemy
refused
altogether
to
yield
to
those
who
were
defeating
them
while
our
men
did
their
utmost
to
achieve
a
signal
victory
and
so
there
arose
the
wildest
confusion
loud
shouts
mingled
with
the
din
of
weapons
as
swords
were
shattered
against
helmets
and
shields
against
spears
it
was
a
hand
to
hand
fight
in
which
they
discarded
their
shields
and
attacked
with
swords
only
while
indifferent
to
their
own
fate
and
devoting
the
utmost
ardour
to
inflicting
severe
loss
on
the
foe
they
were
ready
to
meet
even
death
if
only
they
could
make
our
victory
seem
doubtful
and
dearly
bought
it
was
not
only
the
infantry
who
behaved
thus
to
their
pursuers
but
even
the
cavalry
whose
spears
were
broken
and
were
now
entirely
useless
their
shafts
are
long
and
polished
and
when
they
had
broken
them
they
dismounted
and
transformed
themselves
into
hoplites
so
for
some
time
they
held
their
own
against
the
greatest
odds
but
since
our
cavalry
kept
shooting
their
arrows
from
a
distance
as
they
rode
after
them
while
the
cuirassiers
made
frequent
charges
as
was
easy
on
that
unobstructed
and
level
plain
and
moreover
night
overtook
them
the
enemy
were
glad
at
last
to
take
to
flight
while
our
men
kept
up
a
vigorous
pursuit
as
far
as
the
camp
and
took
it
by
assault
together
with
the
baggage
and
slaves
and
baggage
animals
directly
the
rout
of
the
enemy
had
begun
as
i
have
described
and
while
we
kept
up
a
hot
pursuit
they
were
driven
towards
the
left
where
the
river
was
on
the
right
of
the
victors
and
there
the
greatest
slaughter
took
place
and
the
river
was
choked
with
the
bodies
of
men
and
horses
indiscriminately
for
the
drave
was
not
like
the
scamander
nor
so
kind
to
the
fugitives
it
did
not
put
ashore
and
cast
forth
from
its
waters
the
dead
in
their
armour
nor
cover
up
and
hide
securely
in
its
eddies
those
who
escaped
alive
for
that
is
what
the
trojan
river
did
perhaps
out
of
kindness
perhaps
it
was
only
that
it
was
so
small
that
it
offered
an
easy
crossing
to
one
who
tried
to
swim
or
walk
in
fact
when
a
single
poplar
was
thrown
into
it
it
formed
a
bridge
and
the
whole
river
roared
with
foam
and
blood
and
beat
upon
the
shoulders
of
achilles
if
indeed
we
may
believe
even
this
but
it
never
did
anything
more
violent
when
a
slight
fire
scorched
it
it
gave
up
fighting
at
once
and
swore
not
to
play
the
part
of
ally
however
this
too
was
probably
a
jest
on
homer
s
part
when
he
invented
that
strange
and
unnatural
sort
of
duel
for
in
the
rest
of
the
poem
also
he
evidently
favours
achilles
and
he
sets
the
army
there
as
mere
spectators
while
he
brings
achilles
on
to
the
field
as
the
only
invincible
and
resistless
warrior
and
makes
him
slay
all
whom
he
encounters
and
put
every
one
of
the
foe
to
flight
simply
by
his
voice
and
bearing
and
the
glance
of
his
eyes
both
when
the
battle
begins
and
on
the
banks
of
the
scamander
till
the
fugitives
were
glad
to
gather
within
the
wall
of
the
city
many
verses
he
devotes
to
relating
this
and
then
he
invents
the
battles
of
the
gods
and
by
embellishing
his
poem
with
such
tales
he
corrupts
his
critics
and
prevents
us
from
giving
a
fair
and
honest
vote
but
if
there
be
any
one
who
refuses
to
be
beguiled
by
the
beauty
of
the
words
and
the
fictions
that
are
imported
into
the
poem
then
though
he
is
as
strict
as
a
member
of
the
areopagus
i
shall
not
dread
his
decision
for
we
are
convinced
by
the
poem
that
the
son
of
peleus
is
a
brave
soldier
he
slays
twenty
men

you
see
he
does
not
hesitate
to
announce
that
war
will
be
resumed
after
the
armistice

the
unmanly
and
cowardly
usurper
sheltered
his
flight
behind
lofty
mountains

built
forts
on
them

did
he
trust
even
to
the
strength
of
the
position

begged
for
forgiveness

he
would
have
obtained
it

he
deserved
it

not
proved
himself
on
many

both
treacherous

to

either
the
opinion
expressed
in

narrative
or
those
admirably
written

but
prefers
to
consider
the
actual
facts
let
him
judge
from
those
accordingly
we
will
next
if
you
please
compare
the
fighting
of
ajax
in
defence
of
the
ships
and
of
the
achaeans
at
the
wall
with
the
emperor
s
achievements
at
that
famous
city
i
mean
the
city
to
which
the
mygdonius
fairest
of
rivers
gives
its
name
though
it
has
also
been
named
after
king
antiochus
then
too
it
has
another
a
barbarian
name
which
is
familiar
to
many
of
you
from
your
intercourse
with
the
barbarians
of
those
parts
this
city
was
besieged
by
an
overwhelming
number
of
parthians
with
their
indian
allies
at
the
very
time
when
the
emperor
was
prepared
to
march
against
the
usurper
and
like
the
sea
crab
which
they
say
engaged
heracles
in
battle
when
he
sallied
forth
to
attack
the
lernaean
monster
the
king
of
the
parthians
crossing
the
tigris
from
the
mainland
encircled
the
city
with
dykes
then
he
let
the
mygdonius
flow
into
these
and
transformed
all
the
space
about
the
city
into
a
lake
and
completely
hemmed
it
in
as
though
it
were
an
island
so
that
only
the
ramparts
stood
out
and
showed
a
little
above
the
water
then
he
besieged
it
by
bringing
up
ships
with
on
board
this
was
not
the
work
of
a
day
but
i
believe
of
almost
four
months
but
the
defenders
within
the
wall
continually
repulsed
the
barbarians
by
burning
the
with
their
and
from
the
wall
they
hauled
up
many
of
the
ships
while
others
were
shattered
by
the
force
of
the
engines
when
discharged
and
the
weight
of
the
missiles
for
some
of
the
stones
that
were
hurled
on
to
them
weighed
as
much
as
seven
attic
talents
when
this
had
been
going
on
for
many
days
in
succession
part
of
the
dyke
gave
way
and
the
water
flowed
in
in
full
tide
carrying
with
it
a
portion
of
the
wall

much
as

hundred

thereupon
he
arrayed
the
besieging
army
in
the
persian
fashion
for
they
keep
up
and
imitate
persian
customs
i
suppose
because
they
do
not
wish
to
be
considered
parthians
and
so
pretend
to
be
persians
that
is
surely
the
reason
why
they
prefer
the
persian
manner
of
dress
and
when
they
march
to
battle
they
look
like
them
and
take
pride
in
wearing
the
same
armour
and
raiment
adorned
with
gold
and
purple
by
this
means
they
try
to
evade
the
truth
and
to
make
it
appear
that
they
have
not
revolted
from
macedon
but
are
merely
resuming
the
empire
that
was
theirs
of
old
their
king
therefore
imitating
xerxes
sat
on
a
sort
of
hill
that
had
been
artificially
made
and
his
army
advanced
accompanied
by
their
beasts
these
came
from
india
and
carried
iron
towers
full
of
archers
first
came
the
cavalry
who
wore
cuirasses
and
the
archers
and
then
the
rest
of
the
cavalry
in
huge
numbers
for
infantry
they
find
useless
for
their
sort
of
fighting
and
it
is
not
highly
regarded
by
them
nor
in
fact
is
it
necessary
to
them
since
the
whole
of
the
country
that
they
inhabit
is
flat
and
bare
for
a
military
force
is
naturally
valued
or
slighted
in
proportion
to
its
actual
usefulness
in
war
accordingly
since
infantry
is
from
the
nature
of
the
country
of
little
use
to
them
it
is
granted
no
great
consideration
in
their
laws
this
happened
in
the
case
of
crete
and
caria
as
well
and
countless
nations
have
a
military
equipment
like
theirs
for
instance
the
plains
of
thessaly
have
proved
suitable
for
cavalry
engagements
and
drill
our
state
on
the
other
hand
since
it
has
had
to
encounter
adversaries
of
all
sorts
and
has
won
its
by
good
judgment
combined
with
good
luck
has
naturally
adapted
itself
to
every
kind
of
armour
and
to
a
varying
equipment

perhaps
those
who
watch
over
the

though
they

may
say
that
all
this
is
irrelevant
to
my

now
whether
what
i
have
been
saying
partly
concerns
you

shall
consider
at
the
proper
time

at
any
rate
i
can
easily
clear
myself
from
the
accusation
of
such
persons
for
i
declare
that
i
make
no
claim
to
be
an
expert
in
their
art
and
one
who
has
not
agreed
to
abide
by
certain
rules
has
the
right
to
neglect
them
and
it
may
be
that
i
shall
prove
to
have
other
convincing
excuses
besides
but
it
is
not
worth
while
to
interrupt
my
speech
and
digress
from
my
theme

longer

there
is
no

me

now
when
the
parthians
advanced
to
attack
the
wall
in
their
splendid
accoutrements
men
and
horses
supported
by
the
indian
elephants
it
was
with
the
utmost
confidence
that
they
would
at
once
take
it
by
assault
and
at
the
signal
to
charge
they
all
pressed
forward
since
every
man
of
them
was
eager
to
be
the
first
to
scale
the
wall
and
win
the
glory
of
that
exploit
they
did
not
imagine
that
there
was
anything
to
fear
nor
did
they
believe
that
the
besieged
would
resist
their
assault
such
was
the
exaggerated
confidence
of
the
parthians
the
besieged
however
kept
their
phalanx
unbroken
at
the
gap
in
the
wall
and
on
the
portion
of
the
wall
that
was
still
intact
they
posted
all
the
in
the
city
and
distributed
among
them
an
equal
number
of
soldiers
but
when
the
enemy
rode
up
and
not
a
single
missile
was
hurled
at
them
from
the
wall
their
confidence
that
they
would
completely
reduce
the
city
was
strengthened
and
they
whipped
and
spurred
on
their
horses
so
that
their
flanks
were
covered
with
blood
until
they
had
left
the
dykes
behind
them
these
dykes
they
had
made
earlier
to
dam
the
mouth
of
the
mygdonius
and
the
mud
thereabouts
was
very
deep
in
fact
there
was
hardly
any
ground
at
all
because
of
the
wood
and
because
the
soil
was
so
rich
and
of
the
sort
that
conceals
springs
under
its
surface
moreover
there
was
in
that
place
a
wide
moat
that
had
been
made
long
ago
to
protect
the
town
and
had
become
filled
up
with
a
bog
of
considerable
depth
now
when
the
enemy
had
already
reached
this
moat
and
were
trying
to
cross
it
a
large
force
of
the
besieged
made
a
sally
while
many
others
hurled
stones
from
the
walls
then
many
of
the
besiegers
were
slain
and
all
with
one
accord
turned
their
horses
in
flight
though
only
from
their
gestures
could
it
be
seen
that
flight
was
what
they
desired
and
intended
for
as
they
were
in
the
act
of
wheeling
them
about
their
horses
fell
and
bore
down
the
riders
with
them
weighed
down
as
they
were
by
their
armour
they
floundered
still
deeper
in
the
bog
and
the
carnage
that
ensued
has
never
yet
been
paralleled
in
any
siege
of
the
same
kind

since
this
fate
had
overtaken
the
cavalry
they
tried
the
elephants
thinking
that
they
would
be
more
likely
to
overawe
us
by
that
novel
sort
of
fighting
for
surely
they
had
not
been
stricken
so
blind
as
not
to
see
that
an
elephant
is
heavier
than
a
horse
since
it
carries
the
load
not
of
two
horses
or
several
but
what
would
i
suppose
require
many
waggons
i
mean
archers
and
javelin
men
and
the
iron
tower
besides
all
this
was
a
serious
hindrance
considering
that
the
ground
was
artificially
made
and
had
been
converted
into
a
bog
and
this
the
event
made
plain
hence
it
is
probable
that
they
were
not
advancing
to
give
battle
but
rather
were
arrayed
to
overawe
the
besieged
they
came
on
in
battle
line
at
equal
distances
from
one
another
in
fact
the
phalanx
of
the
parthians
resembled
a
wall
with
the
elephants
carrying
the
towers
and
hoplites
filling
up
the
spaces
between
but
drawn
up
as
these
were
they
were
of
no
great
use
to
the
barbarian
it
was
however
a
spectacle
which
gave
the
defenders
on
the
wall
great
pleasure
and
entertainment
and
when
they
had
gazed
their
fill
at
what
resembled
a
splendid
and
costly
pageant
in
procession
they
hurled
stones
from
their
engines
and
shooting
their
arrows
challenged
the
barbarians
to
fight
for
the
wall
now
the
parthians
are
naturally
and
they
could
not
endure
to
incur
ridicule
and
lead
back
this
imposing
force
without
striking
a
blow
so
by
the
king
s
express
command
they
charged
at
the
wall
and
received
a
continuous
fire
of
stones
and
arrows
while
some
of
the
elephants
were
wounded
and
perished
by
sinking
into
the
mud
thereupon
in
fear
for
the
others
also
they
led
them
back
to
the
camp

having
failed
in
this
second
attempt
as
well
the
parthian
king
divided
his
archers
into
companies
and
ordered
them
to
relieve
one
another
and
to
keep
shooting
at
the
breach
in
the
wall
so
that
the
beseiged
could
not
rebuild
it
and
thus
ensure
the
safety
of
the
town
for
he
hoped
by
this
means
either
to
take
it
by
surprise
or
by
mere
numbers
to
overwhelm
the
garrison
but
the
preparations
that
had
been
made
by
the
emperor
made
it
clear
that
the
barbarian
s
plan
was
futile
for
in
the
rear
of
the
hoplites
a
second
wall
was
being
built
and
while
he
thought
they
were
using
the
old
line
of
the
wall
for
the
foundations
and
that
the
work
was
not
yet
in
hand
they
had
laboured
continuously
for
a
whole
day
and
night
till
the
wall
had
risen
to
a
height
of
four
cubits
and
at
daybreak
it
became
visible
a
new
and
conspicuous
piece
of
work
moreover
the
besieged
did
not
for
a
moment
yield
their
ground
but
kept
relieving
one
another
and
shooting
their
javelins
at
those
who
were
attacking
the
fallen
wall
and
all
this
terribly
dismayed
the
barbarian
nevertheless
he
did
not
at
once
lead
off
his
army
but
employed
the
same
efforts
over
again
but
when
he
had
done
as
before
and
as
before
suffered
repulse
he
did
lead
his
army
back
having
lost
many
whole
tribes
through
famine
and
squandered
many
lives
over
the
dykes
and
in
the
siege
he
had
also
put
to
death
many
satraps
one
after
another
on
various
charges
blaming
one
of
them
because
the
dykes
had
not
been
made
strong
enough
but
gave
way
and
were
flooded
by
the
waters
of
the
river
another
because
when
fighting
under
the
walls
he
had
not
distinguished
himself
and
others
he
executed
for
one
offence
or
another
this
is
in
fact
the
regular
custom
among
the
barbarians
in
asia
to
shift
the
blame
of
their
on
to
their
subjects
thus
then
the
king
acted
on
that
occasion
and
afterwards
took
himself
off
and
from
that
time
he
has
kept
the
peace
with
us
and
has
never
asked
for
any
covenant
or
treaty
but
he
stays
at
home
and
is
thankful
if
only
the
emperor
does
not
march
against
him
and
exact
vengeance
for
his
audacity
and
folly

and
now
am
i
justified
in
comparing
this
battle
with
those
that
were
fought
in
defence
of
the
greek
ships
and
the
wall
observe
the
following
points
of
similarity
and
note
also
the
difference
of
the
greeks
the
two
ajaxes
the
lapithae
and
menestheus
fell
back
from
the
wall
and
looked
on
helplessly
while
the
gates
were
battered
down
by
hector
and
sarpedon
scaled
the
battlements
but
our
garrison
did
not
give
way
even
when
the
wall
fell
in
of
itself
but
they
fought
and
won
and
repulsed
the
parthians
aided
though
these
were
by
their
indian
allies
then
again
hector
went
up
on
to
the
ships
and
fought
from
their
decks
on
foot
and
as
though
from
behind
a
rampart
whereas
our
garrison
first
had
to
fight
a
naval
battle
from
the
walls
and
finally
while
hector
and
sarpedon
had
to
retreat
from
the
battlements
and
the
ships
the
garrison
routed
not
only
the
forces
that
brought
ships
to
the
attack
but
the
land
force
as
well
now
it
is
appropriate
that
by
some
happy
chance
my
speech
should
have
alluded
to
hector
and
sarpedon
and
to
what
i
may
call
the
very
crown
of
their
achievements
i
mean
the
destruction
of
that
wall
which
homer
tells
us
the
achaeans
built
only
the
day
before
on
the
advice
of
the
princely
orator
of
pylos
to
be
an
impregnable
bulwark
for
the
ships

he
had
to
endure
many
taunts

despaired
of
making
a
stand
against
the

made
a
specious
excuse
for
going
to
the
city
to
advise
his
mother
to
propitiate
athene
in
company
with
the
trojan
women

yet
if
in
person
he
had
besought
the
goddess
before

temple

would
have

reason
for
that

it
is

my
opinion
that
a
general
or
king
should
always
serve
the
god
with
the
appointed
ritual
like
a
priest
or
prophet
and
not
neglect
this
duty
nor
think
it
more
fitting
for
another
and
depute
it

though

such
a
service
beneath

δὲ
ἴσως

for
here
i
think
i
may
without
offence
adapt
slightly
plato
s
language
where
he
says
that
the
man
and
especially
the
king
best
equipped
for
this
life
is
he
who
depends
on
god
for
all
that
relates
to
happiness
and
does
not
hang
in
suspense
on
other
men
whose
actions
whether
good
or
bad
are
liable
to
force
him
and
his
affairs
out
of
the
straight
path
and
though
no
one
should
allow
me
to
paraphrase
or
change
that
passage
or
alter
that
word
and
though
i
should
be
told
that
i
must
leave
it
undisturbed
like
something
holy
and
consecrated
by
time
even
in
that
case
i
shall
maintain
that
this
is
what
that
wise
man
meant
for
when
he
says
depends
on
himself
assuredly
he
does
not
refer
to
a
man
s
body
or
his
property
or
long
descent
or
distinguished
ancestors
for
these
are
indeed
his
belongings
but
they
are
not
the
man
himself
his
real
self
is
his
mind
his
intelligence
and
in
a
word
the
god
that
is
in
us
as
to
which
plato
elsewhere
calls
it
the
supreme
form
of
the
soul
that
is
within
us
and
says
that
god
has
given
it
to
each
one
of
us
as
a
guiding
genius
even
that
which
we
say
dwells
in
the
summit
of
our
body
and
raises
us
from
earth
towards
our
celestial
it
is
on
this
that
he
plainly
says
every
man
ought
to
depend
and
not
on
other
men
who
have
so
often
succeeded
when
they
wish
to
harm
and
hinder
us
in
other
respects
indeed
it
has
happened
before
now
that
even
without
such
a
desire
men
have
deprived
us
of
certain
of
our
possessions
but
this
alone
can
not
be
hindered
or
harmed
since
heaven
does
not
permit
the
bad
to
injure
what
is
better
than
this
saying
also
is
from
plato
but
it
may
be
that
i
am
wearying
you
with
these
doctrines
of
his
with
which
i
sprinkle
my
own
utterances
in
small
quantities
as
with
salt
or
gold
dust
for
salt
makes
our
food
more
agreeable
and
gold
enhances
an
effect
to
the
eye
but
plato
s
doctrines
produce
both
effects
for
as
we
listen
to
them
they
give
more
pleasure
than
salt
to
the
sense
and
they
have
a
wonderful
power
of
sweetly
nourishing
and
cleansing
the
soul
so
that
i
must
not
hesitate
or
be
cautious
of
criticism
if
someone
reproaches
me
with
being
insatiable
and
grasping
at
everything
like
persons
at
a
banquet
who
in
their
greed
to
taste
every
dish
can
not
keep
their
hands
from
what
is
set
before
them
for
something
of
this
sort
seems
to
happen
in
my
case
when
in
the
same
breath
i
utter
panegyric
and
philosophic
theories
and
before
i
have
done
justice
to
my
original
theme
break
off
in
the
middle
to
expound
the
sayings
of
philosophers
i
have
had
occasion
before
now
to
reply
to
those
who
make
such
criticisms
as
these
and
perhaps
i
shall
have
to
do
so
again

i
will
now
however
resume
the
thread
of
my
discourse
and
go
back
to
my
like
those
who
when
a
race
is
being
started
run
ahead
out
of
the
line
well
i
was
saying
a
moment
ago
that
plato
declares
that
a
man
s
real
self
is
his
mind
and
soul
whereas
his
body
and
his
estate
are
but
his
possessions
this
is
the
distinction
made
in
that
marvellous
work
the
laws
and
so
if
one
were
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
and
say
that
man
is
best
equipped
for
life
who
makes
everything
that
relates
to
happiness
depend
on
his
mind
and
intelligence
and
not
on
those
outside
himself
who
by
doing
or
faring
well
or
ill
force
him
out
of
the
straight
path
he
is
not
changing
or
perverting
the
sense
of
the
words
but
expounds
and
interprets
them
correctly
and
if
for
plato
s
word
genius
he
substitutes
the
word
god
he
has
a
perfect
right
to
do
so
for
if
plato
gives
the
control
of
our
whole
life
to
the
presiding
genius
within
us
which
is
by
nature
unaffected
by
sensation
and
akin
to
god
but
must
endure
and
suffer
much
because
of
its
association
with
the
body
and
therefore
gives
the
impression
to
the
crowd
that
it
also
is
subject
to
sensation
and
death
and
if
he
says
that
this
is
true
of
every
man
who
wishes
to
be
happy
what
must
we
suppose
is
his
opinion
about
pure
intelligence
unmixed
with
earthly
substance
which
is
indeed
synonymous
with
god
to
this
i
say
every
man
whether
he
be
a
private
citizen
or
a
king
ought
to
entrust
the
reins
of
his
life
and
by
a
king
i
mean
one
who
is
really
worthy
of
the
name
and
not
counterfeit
or
falsely
so
called
but
one
who
is
aware
of
god
and
discerns
his
nature
because
of
his
affinity
with
him
and
being
truly
wise
bows
to
the
divine
authority
and
yields
the
supremacy
to
god
for
it
is
senseless
and
arrogant
indeed
for
those
who
cultivate
virtue
not
to
submit
to
god
once
and
for
all
as
far
as
possible
for
we
must
believe
that
this
above
all
else
is
what
god
approves
again
no
man
must
neglect
the
traditional
form
of
worship
or
lightly
regard
this
method
of
paying
honour
to
the
higher
power
but
rather
consider
that
to
be
virtuous
is
to
be
scrupulously
devout
for
piety
is
the
child
of
justice
and
that
justice
is
a
characteristic
of
the
more
divine
type
of
soul
is
obvious
to
all
who
discuss
such
matters

on

he
had
as
i
said
no
right
to
go
back
to
the
city
or
forsake
the
battle
seeing
that
the
task
he
was
about
to
perform
was
not
that
of
a
general
or
of
a
king
but
of
a
messenger
and
underling
and
that
he
was
ready
to
take
on
himself
the
office
of
an
idaeus
or
talthybius
however
as
i
said
at
first
this
seems
to
have
been
simply
a
specious
excuse
for
flight
and
indeed
when
he
obeyed
the
bidding
of
the
seer
and
fought
a
duel
with
the
son
of
telamon
he
was
very
ready
to
make
terms
and
to
give
presents
and
rejoiced
to
have
escaped
death
in
short
as
a
rule
he
is
brave
when
in
pursuit
of
the
retreating
foe
but
in
no
case
has
he
the
credit
of
a
victory
or
of
turning
the
tide
of
battle

when

together
with
sarpedon
shall
i
therefore
shrink
from
competition
as
though
i
could
not
cite
on
behalf
of
the
emperor
any
such
exploit
and
must
therefore
avoid
seeming
to
compare
the
trivial
with
the
important
and
things
of
little
account
with
what
deserves
more
serious
consideration
or
shall
i
venture
to
enter
the
lists
even
against
an
achievement
so
famous
now
that
wall
was
to
protect
the
beach
and
was
a
palisade
such
as
we
are
wont
to
construct
and
was
completed
in
less
than
a
morning
but
the
wall
that
was
on
the
alps
was
an
ancient
fort
and
the
usurper
used
it
after
his
flight
converting
it
into
a
defence
as
strong
as
though
it
had
been
newly
built
and
he
left
there
an
ample
garrison
of
seasoned
troops
but
he
did
not
himself
march
all
the
way
there
but
remained
in
the
neighbouring
city
this
is
a
trading
centre
of
the
italians
on
the
coast
very
prosperous
and
teeming
with
wealth
since
the
mysians
and
paeonians
and
all
the
italian
inhabitants
of
the
interior
procure
their
merchandise
thence
these
last
used
i
think
to
be
called
heneti
in
the
past
but
now
that
the
romans
are
in
possession
of
these
cities
they
preserve
the
original
name
but
make
the
trifling
addition
of
one
letter
at
the
beginning
of
the
word
its
sign
is
a
single
character
and
they
call
it
oo
and
they
often
use
it
instead
of
b
to
serve
i
suppose
as
a
sort
of
breathing
and
to
represent
some
peculiarity
of
their
pronunciation
the
nation
as
a
whole
is
called
by
this
name
but
at
the
time
of
the
founding
of
the
city
an
eagle
from
zeus
flew
past
on
the
right
and
so
bestowed
on
the
place
the
omen
derived
from
the
bird
it
is
situated
at
the
foot
of
the
alps
which
are
very
high
mountains
with
precipices
in
them
and
they
hardly
allow
room
for
those
who
are
trying
to
force
their
way
over
the
passes
to
use
even
a
single
waggon
and
a
pair
of
mules
they
begin
at
the
sea
which
we
call
ionian
and
form
a
barrier
between
what
is
now
italy
and
the
illyrians
and
galatians
and
extend
as
far
as
the
etruscan
sea
for
when
the
romans
conquered
the
whole
of
this
country
which
includes
the
tribe
of
the
heneti
and
some
of
the
ligurians
and
a
considerable
number
of
galatians
besides
they
did
not
hinder
them
from
retaining
their
ancient
names
but
compelled
them
to
acknowledge
the
dominion
of
the
italian
republic
and
in
our
day
all
the
territory
that
lies
within
the
alps
and
is
bounded
by
the
ionian
and
the
etruscan
seas
has
the
honour
of
being
called
italy
on
the
other
side
of
the
alps
on
the
west
dwell
the
galatians
and
the
rhaetians
to
the
north
where
the
rhine
and
the
danube
have
their
sources
hard
by
in
the
neighbouring
country
of
the
barbarians
and
on
the
east
as
i
said
the
alps
fortify
the
district
where
the
usurper
stationed
his
garrison
in
this
way
then
italy
is
contained
on
all
sides
partly
by
mountains
that
are
very
hard
to
cross
partly
by
a
shallow
sea
into
which
countless
streams
empty
and
form
a
morass
like
the
marshlands
of
egypt
but
the
emperor
by
his
skill
gained
control
of
the
whole
of
that
boundary
of
the
sea
and
forced
his
way
inland

i
will
now
relate
how
the
city
was
actually
taken
lest
you
should
think
i
am
wasting
time
by
describing
once
more
the
difficulties
of
the
ground
and
how
it
was
impossible
to
plant
a
camp
or
even
a
palisade
near
the
city
or
to
bring
up
or
devices
for
storming
it
because
the
country
all
about
was
terribly
short
of
water
and
there
were
not
even
small
pools
and
if
you
wish
to
grasp
the
main
point
of
my
narrative
in
a
few
words
remember
the
macedonian
s
expedition
against
those
indians
who
lived
on
the
famous
rock
up
to
which
not
even
the
lightest
birds
could
wing
their
flight
and
how
he
took
it
by
storm
and
you
will
be
content
to
hear
no
more
from
me
however
i
will
add
this
merely
that
alexander
in
storming
the
rock
lost
many
of
his
macedonians
whereas
our
ruler
and
general
lost
not
a
single
chiliarch
or
a
captain
nay
not
even
a
legionary
from
the
but
achieved
an
unsullied
and
tearless
victory
now
hector
and
sarpedon
no
doubt
hurled
down
many
men
from
the
wall
but
when
they
encountered
patroclus
in
all
his
glory
sarpedon
was
slain
near
the
ships
while
hector
to
his
shame
fled
without
even
recovering
the
body
of
his
friend
thus
without
intelligence
and
emboldened
by
mere
physical
strength
they
ventured
to
attack
the
wall
but
the
emperor
when
strength
and
daring
are
required
employs
force
of
arms
and
good
counsel
together
and
so
wins
the
day
but
where
good
judgment
alone
is
necessary
it
is
by
this
that
he
steers
his
course
and
thus
achieves
triumphs
such
as
not
even
iron
could
ever
avail
to
erase

of

reached
this
point

there
seemed
to
me
to
be
any
affinity
between

of

described
because
of
that
resemblance
comparing
great
things
with
small
and
indeed
if
one
considers
the
size
of
their
armaments
the
superiority
of
his
forces
also
becomes
evident

in

days

but
to
try
to
count
up
the
nations
who
lately
marched
with
the
emperor
and
fought
on
his
side
in
the
war
would
be
idle
talk
superfluous
verbiage
and
absurd
simplicity
and
it
is
natural
that
in
proportion
as
the
armies
are
larger
their
achievements
are
more
important
so
it
follows
of
necessity
that
in
this
respect
as
well
the
emperor
s
army
surpassed
homer
s
heroes
in
mere
numbers
at
any
rate
at
what
point
i
ask
could
one
justly
compare
them
for
the
greeks
fought
all
along
for
a
single
city
and
the
trojans
when
they
prevailed
were
not
able
to
drive
away
the
greeks
nor
were
the
greeks
strong
enough
when
they
won
a
victory
to
destroy
and
overthrow
the
power
and
the
royal
sway
of
the
house
of
priam
and
yet
the
time
they
spent
over
it
was
ten
years
long
but
the
emperor
s
wars
and
undertakings
have
been
numerous
he
has
been
described
as
waging
war
against
the
germans
across
the
rhine
and
then
there
was
his
bridge
of
boats
over
the
tigris
and
his
exposure
of
the
power
and
arrogance
of
the
parthians
was
no
trivial
thing
on
that
occasion
when
they
did
not
venture
to
defend
their
country
while
he
was
laying
it
waste
but
had
to
look
on
while
the
whole
of
it
was
devastated
between
the
tigris
and
the
lycus
then
when
the
war
against
the
usurper
was
concluded
there
followed
the
expeditions
to
sicily
and
carthage
and
that
stratagem
of
occupying
beforehand
the
mouth
of
the
po
which
deprived
the
usurper
of
all
his
forces
in
italy
and
finally
that
third
and
last
fall
at
the
cottian
alps
which
secured
for
the
emperor
the
pleasure
of
a
victory
that
was
sure
and
carried
with
it
no
fears
for
the
future
while
it
compelled
the
defeated
man
to
inflict
on
himself
a
just
penalty
wholly
worthy
of
his
misdeeds

have
given
this
brief
account
of
the
emperor
s
achievements
not
adding
anything
in
flattery
and
trying
to
exaggerate
things
that
are
perhaps
of
no
special
importance
nor
dragging
in
what
is
and
unduly
pressing
points
of
resemblance
with
those
achievements
like
those
who
interpret
the
myths
of
the
poets
and
analyse
them
into
plausible
versions
which
allow
them
to
introduce
fictions
of
their
own
though
they
start
out
from
very
slight
analogies
and
having
recourse
to
a
very
shadowy
basis
try
to
convince
us
that
this
is
the
very
thing
that
the
poets
intended
to
say
but
in
this
case
if
anyone
should
take
out
of
homer
s
poems
merely
the
names
of
the
heroes
and
insert
and
fit
in
the
emperor

the
epic
of
the
iliad

be
seen
to

but
that
you
may
not
think
if
you
hear
only
about
his
achievements
and
successes
in
war
that
the
emperor
is
less
well
endowed
for
pursuits
that
are
loftier
and
rightly
considered
of
more
importance
i
mean
public
speaking
and
deliberations
and
all
those
affairs
in
which
judgment
combined
with
intelligence
and
prudence
take
the
helm
consider
the
case
of
odysseus
and
nestor
who
are
so
highly
praised
in
the
poem
and
if
you
find
that
the
emperor
is
inferior
to
them
in
any
respect
put
that
down
to
his
panegyrists
but
we
should
rather
in
fairness
concede
that
he
is
far
superior
nestor
for
instance
when
they
began
to
disagree
and
quarrel
about
the
captive
damsel
tried
to
address
them
and
he
did
persuade
the
king
and
the
son
of
thetis
but
only
to
this
extent
that
achilles
broke
up
the
assembly
in
disorder
while
agamemnon
did
not
even
wait
to
complete
his
expiation
to
the
god
but
while
he
was
still
performing
the
rite
and
the
sacred
ship
was
in
view
he
sent
heralds
to
the
tent
of
achilles
just
as
though
it
seems
to
me
he
were
afraid
that
he
would
forget
his
anger
and
once
free
from
that
passion
would
repent
and
avoid
his
error
again
the
orator
from
ithaca
when
he
tried
to
persuade
achilles
to
make
peace
and
offered
him
many
gifts
and
promised
him
countless
others
so
provoked
the
young
warrior
that
though
he
had
not
before
planned
to
sail
home
he
now
began
to
make
preparations
then
there
are
those
wonderful
proofs
of
their
intelligence
their
exhortations
to
battle
and
nestor
s
building
of
the
wall
a
cowardly
notion
and
worthy
indeed
of
an
old
man
nor
in
truth
did
the
achaeans
benefit
much
from
that
device
for
it
was
after
they
had
finished
the
wall
that
they
were
worsted
by
the
trojans
and
naturally
enough
for
before
that
they
thought
that
they
were
themselves
protecting
the
ships
like
a
noble
bulwark
but
when
they
realised
that
a
wall
lay
in
front
of
them
built
with
a
deep
moat
and
set
at
intervals
with
sharp
stakes
they
grew
careless
and
slackened
their
valour
because
they
trusted
to
the
fortification
yet
it
is
not
anyone
who
blames
them
and
shows
that
they
were
in
the
wrong
who
is
therefore
a
fit
and
proper
person
to
praise
the
emperor
but
he
who
in
a
worthy
manner
recounts
the
emperor
s
deeds
which
were
done
not
idly
or
automatically
or
from
an
irrational
impulse
but
were
skilfully
planned
beforehand
and
carried
through
he
alone
praises
adequately
the
emperor
s
keen
intelligence

but
to
report
to
you
those
speeches
which
he
made
at
every
public
gathering
to
the
armies
and
the
common
people
and
the
councils
demands
too
long
a
narrative
though
it
is
perhaps
not
too
much
to
ask
you
to
hear
about
one
of
these
pray
then
think
once
more
of
the
son
of
laertes
when
the
greeks
were
rushing
to
set
sail
and
he
checked
the
rush
and
diverted
their
zeal
back
to
the
war
and
then
of
the
emperor
s
assembly
in
illyria
when
that
old
man
persuaded
by
mere
youths
to
think
childish
thoughts
forgot
his
treaties
and
obligations
and
proved
to
be
the
enemy
of
his
preserver
and
benefactor
and
came
to
terms
with
one
against
whom
the
emperor
was
waging
a
war
that
allowed
no
truce
nor
herald
of
a
truce
and
who
was
not
only
getting
an
army
together
but
came
to
meet
the
emperor
on
the
border
of
the
country
because
he
was
anxious
to
hinder
him
from
advancing
further
and
when
those
two
armies
met
and
it
was
necessary
to
hold
an
assembly
in
the
presence
of
the
hoplites
a
high
platform
was
set
up
and
it
was
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
hoplites
and
archers
and
cavalry
equipped
with
their
horses
and
the
standards
of
the
divisions
then
the
emperor
accompanied
by
him
who
for
the
moment
was
his
colleague
mounted
the
platform
carrying
no
sword
or
shield
or
helmet
but
wearing
his
usual
dress
and
not
even
one
of
his
bodyguard
followed
him
but
there
he
stood
alone
on
the
platform
trusting
to
that
speech
which
was
so
impressively
appropriate
for
of
speeches
too
he
is
a
good
craftsman
though
he
does
not
plane
down
and
polish
his
phrases
nor
elaborate
his
periods
like
the
ingenious
rhetoricians
but
is
at
once
dignified
and
simple
and
uses
the
right
words
on
every
occasion
so
that
they
sink
into
the
souls
not
only
of
those
who
claim
to
be
cultured
and
intelligent
but
many
unlearned
persons
too
understand
and
give
hearing
to
his
words
and
so
he
won
over
many
tens
of
thousands
of
hoplites
and
twenty
thousand
cavalry
and
most
warlike
nations
and
at
the
same
time
a
country
that
is
extremely
fertile
not
seizing
it
by
force
or
carrying
off
captives
but
by
winning
over
men
who
obeyed
him
of
their
own
free
will
and
were
eager
to
carry
out
his
orders
this
victory
i
judge
to
be
far
more
splendid
than
that
for
which
sparta
is
famous
for
that
was
tearless
for
the
victors
only
but
the
emperor
s
did
not
cause
even
the
defeated
to
shed
tears
but
he
who
was
masquerading
as
emperor
came
down
from
the
platform
when
he
had
pleaded
his
cause
and
handed
over
to
the
emperor
the
imperial
purple
as
though
it
were
an
ancestral
debt
and
all
else
the
emperor
gave
him
in
abundance
more
than
they
say
cyrus
gave
to
his
grandfather
and
arranged
that
he
should
live
and
be
maintained
in
the
manner
that
homer
recommends
for
men
who
are
past

not

many
generations
later
he
reported
his
speeches
since
his
speakers
left
no
record
of
what
they
said
in
their
assemblies
and
i
think
he
was
clearly
confident
that
he
was
able
to
relate
and
report
what
they
said
in
a
better
style
but
to
make
an
inferior
copy
is
absurd
and
unworthy
of
a
generous
and
noble
soul
now
as
to
the
marvellous
portion
of
his
achievements
and
those
of
which
the
great
multitude
was
spectator
and
hence
preserves
their
memory
and
commends
them
since
it
looks
to
the
result
and
is
there
to
judge
whether
they
turn
out
well
or
ill
and
eulogises
them
in
language
that
is
certainly
not
elegant
to
all
this
i
say
you
have
often
heard
from
the
ingenious
sophists
and
from
the
race
of
poets
inspired
by
the
muses
themselves
so
that
as
far
as
these
are
concerned
i
must
have
wearied
you
by
speaking
about
them
at
too
great
length
for
you
are
already
surfeited
with
them
your
ears
are
filled
with
them
and
there
will
always
be
a
supply
of
composers
of
such
discourses
to
sing
of
battles
and
proclaim
victories
with
a
loud
clear
voice
after
the
manner
of
the
heralds
at
the
olympic
games
for
you
yourselves
since
you
delight
to
listen
to
them
have
produced
an
abundance
of
these
men
and
no
wonder
for
their
conceptions
of
what
is
good
and
bad
are
akin
to
your
own
and
they
do
but
report
to
you
your
own
opinions
and
depict
them
in
fine
phrases
like
a
dress
of
many
colours
and
cast
them
into
the
mould
of
agreeable
rhythms
and
forms
and
bring
them
forth
for
you
as
though
they
had
invented
something
new
and
you
welcome
them
eagerly
and
think
that
this
is
the
correct
way
to
eulogise
and
you
say
that
these
deeds
have
received
their
due
and
this
is
perhaps
true
but
it
may
well
be
otherwise
since
you
do
not
really
know
what
the
correct
way
should
be

for
i
have
observed
that
socrates
the
know
the
man
by
hearsay
and
that
his
reputation
for
wisdom
was
proclaimed
aloud
by
the
pythian
oracle
say
i
have
observed
that
he
did
not
praise
that
sort
of
thing
nor
would
he
admit
that
they
are
happy
and
fortunate
who
are
masters
of
a
great
territory
and
many
nations
with
many
greeks
too
among
them
and
still
more
numerous
and
powerful
barbarians
such
men
as
are
able
to
cut
a
canal
through
athos
and
join
continents
by
a
bridge
of
boats
whenever
they
please
and
who
subdue
nations
and
reduce
islands
by
sweeping
the
inhabitants
into
a
net
and
make
offerings
of
a
thousand
talents
worth
of
frankincense
therefore
he
never
praised
xerxes
or
any
other
king
of
persia
or
lydia
or
macedonia
and
not
even
a
greek
general
save
only
a
very
few
whomsoever
he
knew
to
delight
in
virtue
and
to
cherish
courage
with
temperance
and
to
love
wisdom
with
justice
but
those
whom
he
saw
to
be
cunning
or
merely
clever
or
generals
and
nothing
more
or
ingenious
or
able
though
each
one
could
lay
claim
to
only
one
small
fraction
of
virtue
to
impose
on
the
masses
these
too
he
would
not
praise
without
reserve
and
his
judgment
is
followed
by
a
host
of
wise
men
who
reverence
virtue
but
as
for
all
those
wonders
and
marvels
that
i
have
described
some
say
of
them
that
they
are
worth
little
others
that
they
are
worth
nothing

also

possibly
you
should

are
mere

that
i
am
an
absurd
and
ignorant
sophist
and
make
pretensions
to
an
art
in
which
i
confess
that
i
have
no
skill
as
indeed
i
must
confess
to
you
when
i
recite
eulogies
that
are
really
deserved
and
such
as
you
think
it
worth
while
to
listen
to
even
though
they
should
seem
to
most
of
you
somewhat
uncouth
and
far
inferior
to
what
has
been
already
uttered
but
if
as
i
said
before
you
accept
the
authors
of
those
other
eulogies
then
my
fear
is
altogether
allayed
for
then
i
shall
not
seem
wholly
out
of
place
but
though
as
i
admit
inferior
to
many
others
yet
judged
by
my
own
standard
not
wholly
unprofitable
nor
attempting
what
is
out
of
place
and
indeed
it
is
probably
not
easy
for
you
to
disbelieve
wise
and
inspired
men
who
have
much
to
say
each
in
his
own
manner
though
the
sum
and
substance
of
all
their
speeches
is
the
praise
of
virtue
and
virtue
they
say
is
implanted
in
the
soul
and
makes
it
happy
and
kingly
yes
by
zeus

statesmanlike

τὸν

for
there
is
nothing
at
all
superior
to
it
nothing
that
can
constrain
and
control
it
or
take
it
from
him
who
has
once
possessed
it
indeed
it
seems
to
me
that
this
possession
bears
the
same
relation
to
the
soul
as
its
light
to
the
sun
for
often
men
have
stolen
the
votive
offerings
of
the
sun
and
destroyed
his
temples
and
gone
their
way
and
some
have
been
punished
and
others
let
alone
as
not
worthy
of
the
punishment
that
leads
to
amendment
but
his
light
no
one
ever
takes
from
the
sun
not
even
the
moon
when
in
their
conjunctions
she
oversteps
his
disc
or
when
she
takes
his
rays
to
herself
and
often
as
the
saying
is
turns
midday
into
night
nor
is
he
deprived
of
his
light
when
he
illumines
the
moon
in
her
station
opposite
to
himself
and
shares
with
her
his
own
nature
nor
when
he
fills
with
light
and
day
this
great
and
wonderful
universe
just
so
no
good
man
who
imparts
his
goodness
to
another
was
ever
thought
to
have
less
virtue
by
as
much
as
he
had
bestowed
so
divine
and
excellent
is
that
possession
and
most
true
is
the
saying
of
the
athenian
stranger
whoever
that
inspired
man
may
have
been
all
the
gold
beneath
the
earth
and
above
ground
is
too
little
to
give
in
exchange
for
let
us
therefore
now
boldly
call
its
possessor
wealthy
yes
and
i
should
say
also
and
the
only
king
among
them
all
if
anyone
agree
to
this
for
as
noble
birth
is
better
than
a
lowly
pedigree
so
virtue
is
better
than
a
character
not
in
all
respects
admirable
and
let
no
one
say
that
this
statement
is
contentious
and
too
strong
judging
by
the
ordinary
use
of
words
for
the
multitude
are
wont
to
say
that
the
sons
of
those
who
have
long
been
rich
are
and
yet
is
it
not
extraordinary
that
a
cook
or
cobbler
yes
by
zeus
or
some
potter
who
has
got
money
together
by
his
craft
or
by
some
other
means
is
not
considered
nor
is
given
that
title
by
the
many
whereas
if
this
man
s
son
inherit
his
estate
and
hand
it
on
to
his
sons
they
begin
to
give
themselves
airs
and
compete
on
the
score
of
noble
birth
with
the
pelopids
and
the
heraclids
nay
even
a
man
who
is
born
of
noble
ancestors
but
himself
sinks
down
in
the
opposite
scale
of
life
could
not
justly
claim
kinship
with
those
ancestors
seeing
that
no
one
could
be
enrolled
among
the
pelopids
who
had
not
on
his
shoulder
the
of
that
family
and
in
boeotia
it
was
said
that
there
was
the
impression
of
a
spear
on
the
from
the
clod
of
earth
that
bore
and
reared
them
and
that
hence
the
race
long
preserved
that
distinguishing
mark
and
can
we
suppose
that
on
men
s
souls
no
mark
of
that
sort
is
engraved
which
shall
tell
us
accurately
who
their
fathers
were
and
vindicate
their
birth
as
legitimate
they
say
that
the
celts
also
have
a
river
which
is
an
incorruptible
judge
of
offspring
and
neither
can
the
mothers
persuade
that
river
by
their
laments
to
hide
and
conceal
their
fault
for
them
nor
the
fathers
who
are
afraid
for
their
wives
and
sons
in
this
trial
but
it
is
an
arbiter
that
never
swerves
or
gives
a
false
verdict
but
we
are
corrupted
by
riches
by
physical
strength
in
its
prime
by
powerful
ancestors
an
influence
from
without
that
overshadows
and
does
not
permit
us
to
see
clearly
or
discern
the
soul
for
we
are
unlike
all
other
living
things
in
this
that
by
the
soul
and
by
nothing
else
we
should
with
reason
make
our
decision
about
noble
birth
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
ancients
employing
a
wondrous
sagacity
of
nature
since
their
wisdom
was
not
like
ours
a
thing
acquired
but
they
were
philosophers
by
nature
not
manufactured
perceived
the
truth
of
this
and
so
they
called
heracles
the
son
of
zeus
and
leda
s
two
sons
also
and
minos
the
and
rhadamanthus
of
cnossus
they
deemed
worthy
of
the
same
distinction
and
many
others
they
proclaimed
to
be
the
children
of
other
gods
because
they
so
surpassed
their
mortal
parents
for
they
looked
at
the
soul
alone
and
their
actual
deeds
and
not
at
wealth
piled
high
and
hoary
with
age
nor
at
the
power
that
had
come
down
to
them
from
some
grandfather
or
and
yet
some
of
them
were
the
sons
of
fathers
not
wholly
inglorious
but
because
of
the
superabundance
in
them
of
that
virtue
which
men
honoured
and
cherished
they
were
held
to
be
the
sons
of
the
gods
themselves
this
is
clear
from
the
following
fact
in
the
case
of
certain
others
though
they
did
not
know
those
who
were
by
nature
their
sires
they
ascribed
that
title
to
a
divinity
to
recompense
the
virtue
of
those
men
and
we
ought
not
to
say
that
they
were
deceived
and
that
in
ignorance
they
told
lies
about
the
gods
for
even
if
in
the
case
of
other
gods
or
deities
it
was
natural
that
they
should
be
so
deceived
when
they
clothed
them
in
human
forms
and
human
shapes
though
those
deities
possess
a
nature
not
to
be
perceived
or
attained
by
the
senses
but
barely
recognisable
by
means
of
pure
intelligence
by
reason
of
their
kinship
with
it
nevertheless
in
the
case
of
the
visible
gods
it
is
not
probable
that
they
were
deceived
for
instance
when
they
entitled
aeetes
son
of
helios
and
another
son
of
the
dawn
and
so
on
with
others
but
as
i
said
we
must
in
these
cases
believe
them
and
make
our
enquiry
about
noble
birth
accordingly
and
when
a
man
has
virtuous
parents
and
himself
resembles
them
we
may
with
confidence
call
him
nobly
born
but
when
though
his
parents
lack
virtue
he
himself
can
claim
to
possess
it
we
must
suppose
that
the
father
who
begat
him
is
zeus
and
we
must
not
pay
less
respect
to
him
than
to
those
who
are
the
sons
of
virtuous
fathers
and
emulate
their
parents
but
when
a
bad
man
comes
of
good
parents
we
ought
to
enrol
him
among
the
bastards
while
as
for
those
who
come
of
a
bad
stock
and
resemble
their
parents
never
must
we
call
them
not
even
though
their
wealth
amounts
to
ten
thousand
talents
not
though
they
reckon
among
their
ancestors
twenty
rulers
or
by
zeus
twenty
tyrants
not
though
they
can
prove
that
the
victories
they
won
at
olympia
or
pytho
or
in
the
encounters
of
are
in
every
way
more
brilliant
than
victories
in
the
more
than
the
first
caesar
s
or
can
point
to
excavations
in
assyria
or
to
the
walls
of
babylon
and
the
egyptian
pyramids
besides
and
to
all
else
that
is
a
proof
of
wealth
and
great
possessions
and
luxury
and
a
soul
that
is
inflamed
by
ambition
and
being
at
a
loss
how
to
use
money
lavishes
on
things
of
that
sort
all
those
abundant
supplies
of
wealth
for
you
are
well
aware
that
it
is
not
wealth
either
ancestral
or
newly
acquired
and
pouring
in
from
some
source
or
other
that
makes
a
king
nor
his
purple
cloak
nor
his
tiara
and
sceptre
and
diadem
and
ancestral
throne
nay
nor
numerous
hoplites
and
ten
thousand
cavalry
not
though
all
men
should
gather
together
and
acknowledge
him
for
their
king
because
virtue
they
can
not
bestow
on
him
but
only
power
indeed
for
him
that
receives
it
but
still
more
for
those
that
bestow
it
for
once
he
has
received
such
power
a
man
of
that
sort
is
altogether
raised
aloft
in
the
clouds
and
in
nowise
differs
from
the
legend
of
phaethon
and
his
fate
and
there
is
no
need
of
other
instances
to
make
us
believe
this
saying
for
the
whole
of
life
is
full
of
such
disasters
and
tales
about
them
and
if
it
seems
surprising
to
you
that
the
title
of
king
so
honourable
so
favoured
by
the
gods
can
not
justly
be
claimed
by
men
who
though
they
rule
over
a
vast
territory
and
nations
without
number
nevertheless
settle
questions
that
arise
by
an
autocratic
decision
without
intelligence
or
wisdom
or
the
virtues
that
go
with
wisdom
believe
me
they
are
not
even
free
men
i
do
not
mean
if
they
merely
possess
what
they
have
with
none
to
hinder
them
and
have
their
fill
of
power
but
even
though
they
conquer
all
who
make
war
against
them
and
when
they
lead
an
invading
army
appear
invincible
and
irresistible
and
if
any
of
you
doubt
this
statement
i
have
no
lack
of
notable
witnesses
greek
and
barbarian
who
fought
and
won
many
mighty
battles
and
became
the
masters
of
whole
nations
and
compelled
them
to
pay
tribute
and
yet
were
themselves
slaves
in
a
still
more
shameful
degree
of
pleasure
money
and
wantonness
insolence
and
injustice
and
no
man
of
sense
would
call
them
even
powerful
not
though
greatness
should
shine
upon
and
illumine
all
that
they
achieved
for
he
alone
is
strong
whose
virtue
aids
him
to
be
brave
and
magnanimous
but
he
who
is
the
slave
of
pleasure
and
can
not
control
his
temper
and
appetites
of
all
sorts
but
is
compelled
to
succumb
to
trivial
things
is
neither

s
strength
though
we
may
perhaps
allow
him
to
exult
like

in

brute
force
if
indeed
he
do
not

even
this
and
like

of

himself
a
feeble
warrior

cowardly

dissolute
and
if
that
be
his
character
he
is
lacking
not

in

riches

in
that
wealth
also
which
men
so
highly
honour

reverence

that

to

at

they
live
ever
acquiring

ever
in

i
do

by
nature
and
none
can
be
deprived
of
it
neither
birds

nor
wild
beasts
much
less
prudent
men
but
those
who
are
tortured
by
the
desire
and
fatal
passion
for
money
must
suffer
a
lifelong
hunger
and
depart
from
life
more
miserably

who
lack

food
for
these
once
they
have
filled

enjoy
perfect
peace
and
respite
from
their
torment
but
for
those
others
no
day
is
sweet
that
does
not
bring
them
gain
nor
does
night
with
her
gift
of
sleep
that
relaxes
the
limbs
and
frees
men
from
care
bring
for
them
any
remission
of
their
raging
madness

distracts
and
agitates
their
souls
as
they
reckon
and
count
up

money
and
not
even
the

of

possess
it
frees
those
men
from

hard
toil
therewith
nay
nor
tyranny

greatest
and
sternest
of

they
become

exacted

but
it
seems
that
my
argument
as
though
it
had
reached
some
steep
descent
is
glutting
itself
with
unsparing
abuse
and
is
chastising
the
manners
of
these
men
beyond
what
is
fitting
so
that
i
must
not
allow
it
to
travel
further
but
now
i
must
demand
from
it
an
account
as
far
as
is
possible
of
the
man
who
is
good
and
kingly
and
in
the
first
place
then
he
is
devout
and
does
not
neglect
the
worship
of
the
gods
and
secondly
he
is
pious
and
ministers
to
his
parents
both
when
they
are
alive
and
after
their
death
and
he
is
friendly
to
his
brothers
and
reverences
the
gods
who
protect
the
family
while
to
suppliants
and
strangers
he
is
mild
and
gentle
and
he
is
anxious
to
gratify
good
citizens
and
governs
the
masses
with
justice
and
for
their
benefit
and
wealth
he
loves
but
not
that
which
is
heavy
with
gold
and
silver
but
that
which
is
full
of
the
true
of
his
friends
and
service
without
flattery
though
by
nature
he
is
brave
and
gallant
he
takes
no
pleasure
in
war
and
detests
civil
discord
though
when
men
do
attack
him
whether
from
some
chance
or
by
reason
of
their
own
wickedness
he
resists
them
bravely
and
defends
himself
with
energy
and
carries
through
his
enterprises
to
the
end
not
desisting
till
he
has
destroyed
the
power
of
the
foe
and
made
it
subject
to
himself
but
after
he
has
conquered
by
force
of
arms
he
makes
his
sword
cease
from
slaughter
because
he
thinks
that
for
one
who
is
no
longer
defending
himself
to
go
on
killing
and
laying
waste
is
to
incur
pollution
and
being
by
nature
fond
of
work
and
great
of
soul
he
shares
in
the
labours
of
all
and
claims
the
lion
s
share
of
those
labours
then
divides
with
the
others
the
rewards
for
the
risks
which
he
has
run
and
is
glad
and
rejoices
not
because
he
has
more
gold
and
silver
treasure
than
other
men
and
palaces
adorned
with
costly
furniture
but
because
he
is
able
to
do
good
to
many
and
to
bestow
on
all
men
whatever
they
may
chance
to
lack
this
is
what
he
who
is
truly
a
king
claims
for
himself
and
since
he
loves
both
the
city
and
the
soldiers
he
cares
for
the
citizens
as
a
shepherd
for
his
flock
planning
how
their
young
may
flourish
and
thrive
eating
their
full
of
abundant
and
undisturbed
pasture
and
his
soldiers
he
oversees
and
keeps
together
training
them
in
courage
strength
and
mercy
like
dogs
noble
guardians
of
the
flock
regarding
them
both
as
the
partners
of
his
exploits
and
the
protectors
of
the
masses
and
not
as
spoilers
and
pillagers
of
the
flock
like
wolves
and
mongrel
dogs
which
forgetting
their
own
nature
and
nurture
turn
out
to
be
marauders
instead
of
preservers
and
defenders
yet
on
the
other
hand
he
will
not
suffer
them
to
be
sluggish
slothful
and
unwarlike
lest
the
guardians
should
themselves
need
others
to
watch
them
nor
disobedient
to
their
officers
because
he
knows
that
obedience
above
all
else
and
sometimes
alone
is
the
saving
discipline
in
war
and
he
will
train
them
to
be
hardy
and
not
afraid
of
any
labour
and
never
indolent
for
he
knows
that
there
is
not
much
use
in
a
guardian
who
shirks
his
task
and
can
not
hold
out
or
endure
fatigue
and
not
only
by
exhorting
or
by
his
readiness
to
praise
the
deserving
or
by
rewarding
and
punishing
severely
and
inexorably
does
he
win
them
over
to
this
and
coerce
them
but
far
rather
does
he
show
that
he
is
himself
what
he
would
have
them
be
since
he
refrains
from
all
pleasure
and
as
for
money
desires
it
not
at
all
much
or
little
nor
robs
his
subjects
of
it
and
since
he
abhors
indolence
he
allows
little
time
for
sleep
for
in
truth
no
one
who
is
asleep
is
good
for
anything
nor
if
when
awake
he
resembles
those
who
are
asleep
and
he
will
i
think
succeed
in
keeping
them
wonderfully
obedient
to
himself
and
to
their
officers
since
he
himself
will
be
seen
to
obey
the
wisest
laws
and
to
live
in
accordance
with
right
precepts
and
in
short
to
be
under
the
guidance
of
that
part
of
the
soul
which
is
naturally
kingly
and
worthy
to
take
the
lead
and
not
of
the
emotional
or
undisciplined
part
for
how
could
one
better
persuade
men
to
endure
and
undergo
fatigue
not
only
in
a
campaign
and
under
arms
but
also
in
all
those
exercises
that
have
been
invented
in
times
of
peace
to
give
men
practice
for
conflicts
abroad
than
by
being
clearly
seen
to
be
oneself
strong
as
adamant
for
in
truth
the
most
agreeable
sight
for
a
soldier
when
he
is
fighting
hard
is
a
prudent
commander
who
takes
an
active
part
in
the
work
in
hand
himself
zealous
while
exhorting
his
men
who
is
cheerful
and
calm
in
what
seems
to
be
a
dangerous
situation
but
on
occasion
stern
and
severe
whenever
they
are
over
confident
for
in
the
matter
of
caution
or
boldness
the
subordinate
naturally
imitates
his
leader
and
he
must
plan
as
well
no
less
than
for
what
i
have
mentioned
that
they
may
have
abundant
provisions
and
run
short
of
none
of
the
necessaries
of
life
for
often
the
most
loyal
guardians
and
protectors
of
the
flock
are
driven
by
want
to
become
fierce
towards
the
shepherds
and
when
they
see
them
from
afar
they
bark
at
them
and
do
not
even
spare
the
sheep

such
then
is
the
good
king
at
the
head
of
his
legions
but
to
his
city
he
is
a
saviour
and
protector
not
only
when
he
is
warding
off
dangers
from
without
or
repelling
barbarian
neighbours
or
invading
them
but
also
by
putting
down
civil
discord
vicious
morals
luxury
and
profligacy
he
will
procure
relief
from
the
greatest
evils
and
by
excluding
insolence
lawlessness
injustice
and
greed
for
boundless
wealth
he
will
not
permit
the
feuds
that
arise
from
these
causes
and
the
dissensions
that
end
in
disaster
to
show
even
the
first
sign
of
growth
and
if
they
do
arise
he
will
abolish
them
as
quickly
as
possible
and
expel
them
from
his
city
and
no
one
who
transgresses
and
violates
the
law
will
escape
his
notice
no
more
than
would
an
enemy
in
the
act
of
scaling
his
defences
but
though
he
is
a
good
guardian
of
the
laws
he
will
be
still
better
at
framing
them
if
ever
occasion
and
chance
call
on
him
to
do
so
and
no
device
can
persuade
one
of
his
character
to
add
to
the
statutes
a
false
and
spurious
and
bastard
law
any
more
than
he
would
introduce
among
his
own
sons
a
servile
and
vulgar
strain
for
he
cares
for
justice
and
the
right
and
neither
parents
nor
kinsfolk
nor
friends
can
persuade
him
to
do
them
a
favour
and
betray
the
cause
of
justice
for
he
looks
upon
his
fatherland
as
the
common
hearth
and
mother
of
all
older
and
more
reverend
than
his
parents
and
more
precious
than
brothers
or
friends
or
comrades
and
to
defraud
or
do
violence
to
her
laws
he
regards
as
a
greater
impiety
than
sacrilegious
robbery
of
the
money
that
belongs
to
the
gods
for
law
is
the
child
of
justice
the
sacred
and
truly
divine
adjunct
of
the
most
mighty
god
and
never
will
the
man
who
is
wise
make
light
of
it
or
set
it
at
naught
but
since
all
that
he
does
will
have
justice
in
view
he
will
be
eager
to
honour
the
good
and
the
vicious
he
will
like
a
good
physician
make
every
effort
to
cure

αἵρεσιν
but
there
are
two
kinds
of
error
for
in
one
type
of
sinner
may
dimly
be
discerned
a
hope
of
improvement
nor
do
they
wholly
reject
a
cure
while
the
vices
of
others
are
incurable
and
for
the
latter
the
laws
have
contrived
the
penalty
of
death
as
a
release
from
evil
and
this
not
only
for
the
benefit
of
the
criminal
but
quite
as
much
in
the
interest
of
others
accordingly
there
must
needs
be
two
kinds
of
trials
for
when
men
are
not
incurable
the
king
will
hold
it
to
be
his
duty
to
investigate
and
to
cure
but
with
the
others
he
will
firmly
refuse
to
interfere
and
will
never
willingly
have
anything
to
do
with
a
trial
when
death
is
the
penalty
that
has
been
ordained
by
the
laws
for
the
guilty
however
in
making
laws
for
such
offences
he
will
do
away
with
violence
and
harshness
and
cruelty
of
punishment
and
will
elect
by
lot
to
judge
them
a
court
of
staid
and
sober
men
who
throughout
their
lives
have
admitted
the
most
rigid
scrutiny
of
their
own
virtue
men
who
will
not
rashly
or
led
by
some
wholly
irrational
impulse
after
deliberating
for
only
a
small
part
of
the
day
or
it
may
be
without
even
debating
cast
the
black
in
the
case
of
a
but
in
his
own
hand
no
sword
should
lie
ready
to
slay
a
citizen
even
though
he
has
committed
the
blackest
crimes
nor
should
a
sting
lurk
in
his
soul
considering
that
as
we
see
nature
has
made
even
the
free
from
a
sting
however
it
is
not
to
bees
that
we
must
look
for
our
analogy
but
in
my
opinion
to
the
king
of
the
gods
himself
whose
prophet
and
the
genuine
ruler
ought
to
be
for
wherever
good
exists
wholly
untainted
by
its
opposite
and
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
in
common
and
the
whole
universe
of
this
good
god
was
and
is
the
only
creator
but
evil
he
neither
created
nor
ordered
to
be
but
he
banished
it
from
heaven
and
as
it
moves
upon
earth
and
has
chosen
for
its
abode
our
souls
that
colony
which
was
sent
down
from
heaven
he
has
enjoined
on
his
sons
and
descendants
to
judge
and
cleanse
men
from
it
now
of
these
some
are
the
friends
and
protectors
of
the
human
race
but
others
are
inexorable
judges
who
inflict
on
men
harsh
and
terrible
punishment
for
their
misdeeds
both
while
they
are
alive
and
after
they
are
set
free
from
their
bodies
and
others
again
are
as
it
were
executioners
and
avengers
who
carry
out
the
sentence
a
different
race
of
inferior
and
unintelligent
demons
now
the
king
who
is
good
and
a
favourite
of
the
gods
must
imitate
this
example
and
share
his
own
excellence
with
many
of
his
subjects
whom
because
of
his
regard
for
them
he
admits
into
this
partnership
and
he
must
entrust
them
with
offices
suited
to
the
character
and
principles
of
each
military
command
for
him
who
is
brave
and
daring
and
spirited
but
discreet
as
well
so
that
when
he
has
need
he
may
use
his
spirit
and
energy
and
for
him
who
is
just
and
kind
and
humane
and
easily
prone
to
pity
that
office
in
the
service
of
the
state
that
relates
to
contracts
devising
this
means
of
protection
for
the
weaker
and
more
simple
citizens
and
for
the
poor
against
the
powerful
fraudulent
and
wicked
and
those
who
are
so
buoyed
up
by
their
riches
that
they
try
to
violate
and
despise
justice
but
to
the
man
who
combines
both
these
temperaments
he
must
assign
still
greater
honour
and
power
in
the
state
and
if
he
entrust
to
him
the
trials
of
offences
for
which
are
enacted
just
pains
and
penalties
with
a
view
to
recompensing
the
injured
that
would
be
a
fair
and
wise
measure
for
a
man
of
this
sort
together
with
his
colleagues
will
give
an
impartial
decision
and
then
hand
over
to
the
public
official
the
carrying
out
of
the
verdict
nor
will
he
through
excess
of
anger
or
fall
short
of
what
is
essentially
just
now
the
ruler
in
our
state
will
be
somewhat
like
this
possessing
only
what
is
good
in
both
those
qualities
and
in
every
quality
that
i
mentioned
earlier
avoiding
a
fatal
excess
and
though
he
will
in
person
oversee
and
direct
and
govern
the
whole
he
will
see
to
it
that
those
of
his
officials
who
are
in
charge
of
the
most
important
works
and
management
and
who
share
his
councils
for
the
general
good
are
virtuous
men
and
as
far
as
possible
like
himself
and
he
will
choose
them
not
carelessly
or
at
random
nor
will
he
consent
to
be
a
less
rigorous
judge
than
a
lapidary
or
one
who
tests
gold
plate
or
purple
dye
for
such
men
are
not
satisfied
with
one
method
of
testing
but
since
they
know
i
suppose
that
the
wickedness
and
devices
of
those
who
are
trying
to
cheat
them
are
various
and
manifold
they
try
to
meet
all
these
as
far
as
possible
and
they
oppose
to
them
the
tests
derived
from
their
art
so
too
our
ruler
apprehends
that
evil
changes
its
face
and
is
apt
to
deceive
and
that
the
cruellest
thing
that
it
does
is
that
it
often
takes
men
in
by
putting
on
the
garb
of
virtue
and
hoodwinks
those
who
are
not
keen
sighted
enough
or
who
in
course
of
time
grow
weary
of
the
length
of
the
investigation
and
therefore
he
will
rightly
be
on
his
guard
against
any
such
deception
but
when
once
he
has
chosen
them
and
has
about
him
the
worthiest
men
he
will
entrust
to
them
the
choice
of
the
minor
officials

such
is
his
policy
with
regard
to
the
laws
and
magistrates
as
for
the
common
people
those
who
live
in
the
towns
he
will
not
allow
to
be
idle
or
impudent
but
neither
will
he
permit
them
to
be
without
the
necessaries
of
life
and
the
farming
class
who
live
in
the
country
ploughing
and
sowing
to
furnish
food
for
their
protectors
and
guardians
will
receive
in
return
payment
in
money
and
the
clothes
that
they
need
but
as
for
assyrian
palaces
and
costly
and
extravagant
public
services
they
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
and
will
end
their
lives
in
the
utmost
peace
as
regards
enemies
at
home
and
abroad
and
will
adore
the
cause
of
their
good
fortune
as
though
he
were
a
kindly
deity
and
praise
god
for
him
when
they
pray
not
hypocritically
or
with
the
lips
only
but
invoking
blessings
on
him
from
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
but
the
gods
do
not
wait
for
their
prayers
and
unasked
they
give
him
celestial
rewards
but
they
do
not
let
him
lack
human
blessings
either
and
if
fate
should
compel
him
to
fall
into
any
misfortune
i
mean
one
of
those
incurable
calamities
that
people
are
always
talking
about
then
the
gods
make
him
their
follower
and
associate
and
exalt
his
fame
among
all
mankind
all
this
i
have
often
heard
from
the
wise
and
in
their
account
of
it
i
have
the
firmest
faith
and
so
i
have
repeated
it
to
you
perhaps
making
a
longer
speech
than
the
occasion
called
for
but
too
short
in
my
opinion
for
the
theme
and
he
to
whom
it
has
been
given
to
hear
such
arguments
and
reflect
on
them
knows
well
that
i
speak
the
truth
but
there
is
another
reason
for
the
length
of
my
speech
less
forcible
but
i
think
more
akin
to
the
present
argument
and
perhaps
you
ought
not
to
miss
hearing
this

in
the
first
place
then
let
me
remind
you
briefly
of
what
i
said
before
when
i
broke
off
my
discourse
for
the
sake
of
this
digression
what
i
said
was
that
when
people
listen
to
sincere
panegyrics
they
ought
not
to
look
to
those
things
of
which
fortune
often
grants
a
share
even
to
the
wicked
but
to
the
character
of
the
man
and
his
virtues
which
belong
only
to
those
who
are
good
and
by
nature
estimable
and
taking
up
my
tale
at
that
point
i
pursued
the
arguments
that
followed
guiding
myself
as
it
were
by
the
rule
and
measure
to
which
one
ought
to
adjust
the
eulogies
of
good
men
and
good
kings
and
when
one
of
them
harmonises
exactly
and
without
variation
with
this
model
he
is
himself
happy
and
truly
fortunate
and
happy
are
those
who
have
a
share
in
such
a
government
as
his
and
he
who
comes
near
to
being
like
him
is
better
and
more
fortunate
than
those
who
fall
further
short
of
him
but
those
who
fail
altogether
to
resemble
him
or
who
follow
an
opposite
course
are
senseless
and
wicked
and
cause
the
greatest
disasters
to
themselves
and
others

ἅπαν
and
now
if
you
are
in
any
way
of
my
opinion
it
is
time
to
proceed
to
those
achievements
that
we
have
so
admired
and
lest
any
should
think
that
my
argument
is
running
alone
like
a
horse
in
a
race
that
has
lost
its
competitor
and
for
that
reason
wins
and
carries
off
the
prizes
i
will
try
to
show
in
what
way
my
encomium
differs
from
that
of
clever
rhetoricians
for
they
greatly
admire
the
fact
that
a
man
is
born
of
ancestors
who
had
power
or
were
kings
since
they
hold
that
the
sons
of
the
prosperous
and
fortunate
are
themselves
blest
but
the
question
that
next
arises
they
neither
think
of
nor
investigate
i
mean
how
they
employed
their
advantages
throughout
their
lives
and
yet
after
all
this
is
the
chief
cause
of
that
happiness
and
of
almost
all
external
goods
unless
indeed
someone
objects
to
this
statement
that
it
is
only
by
wise
use
of
it
that
property
becomes
a
good
and
that
it
is
harmful
when
the
opposite
use
is
made
so
that
it
is
not
a
great
thing
as
they
think
to
be
descended
from
a
king
who
was
wealthy
and
rich
in
gold
but
it
is
truly
great
while
surpassing
the
virtue
of
one
s
ancestors
to
behave
to
one
s
parents
in
a
manner
beyond
reproach
in
all
respects

do
you
wish
to
learn
whether
this
is
true
of
the
emperor
i
will
offer
you
trustworthy
evidence
and
i
know
well
that
you
will
not
convict
me
of
false
witness
for
i
shall
but
remind
you
of
what
you
know
already
and
perhaps
you
understand
even
now
what
i
mean
but
if
it
is
not
yet
evident
you
very
soon
will
when
you
call
to
mind
that
the
emperor
s
father
loved
him
more
than
the
others
though
he
was
by
no
means
to
his
children
for
it
was
character
that
he
favoured
rather
than
the
ties
of
blood
but
he
was
i
suppose
won
over
by
the
emperor
s
dutiful
service
to
him
and
as
he
had
nothing
to
reproach
him
with
he
made
his
affection
for
him
evident
and
a
proof
of
his
feeling
is
first
that
he
chose
for
constantius
that
portion
of
the
empire
which
he
had
formerly
thought
best
suited
to
himself
and
secondly
that
when
he
was
at
the
point
of
death
he
passed
over
his
eldest
and
youngest
sons
though
they
were
at
leisure
and
summoned
constantius
who
was
not
at
leisure
and
entrusted
him
with
the
whole
government
and
when
he
had
become
master
of
the
whole
he
behaved
to
his
brothers
at
once
so
justly
and
with
such
moderation
that
while
they
who
had
neither
been
summoned
nor
had
come
of
themselves
quarrelled
and
fought
with
one
another
they
showed
no
resentment
against
constantius
nor
ever
reproached
him
and
when
their
feud
reached
its
fatal
issue
though
he
might
have
laid
claim
to
a
greater
share
of
empire
he
renounced
it
of
his
own
free
will
because
he
thought
that
many
nations
or
few
called
for
the
exercise
of
the
same
virtues
and
also
perhaps
that
the
more
a
man
has
to
look
after
and
care
for
the
greater
are
the
anxieties
beset
him
for
he
does
not
think
that
the
imperial
power
is
a
means
of
procuring
luxury
nor
that
as
certain
men
who
have
wealth
and
misapply
it
for
drink
and
other
pleasures
set
their
hearts
on
lavish
and
revenues
this
ought
to
be
an
emperor
s
policy
nor
that
he
ought
ever
to
embark
on
a
war
except
only
for
the
benefit
of
his
subjects
and
so
he
allowed
his
brother
to
have
the
lion
s
share
and
thought
that
if
he
himself
possessed
the
smaller
share
with
honour
he
had
the
advantage
in
what
was
most
worth
having
and
that
it
was
not
rather
from
fear
of
his
brother
s
resources
that
he
preferred
peace
you
may
consider
clearly
proved
by
the
war
that
broke
out
later
for
he
had
recourse
to
arms
later
on
against
his
brother
s
forces
but
it
was
to
avenge
him
and
here
again
there
are
perhaps
some
who
have
admired
him
merely
for
having
won
the
victory
but
i
admire
far
more
the
fact
that
it
was
with
justice
that
he
undertook
the
war
and
that
he
carried
it
through
with
great
courage
and
skill
and
when
fortune
gave
him
a
favourable
issue
used
his
victory
with
moderation
and
in
imperial
fashion
and
showed
himself
entirely
worthy
to
overcome

it

ταῦτα

ὅτι
for
it
was
because
he
desired
to
avenge
one
woman
that
he
went
to
war
with
the
trojans
but
the
wrongs
done
to
constantius
were
still
fresh
and
he
who
was
in
power
was
not
like
darius
or
priam
a
man
of
royal
birth
who
it
may
be
laid
claim
to
an
empire
that
belonged
to
him
by
reason
of
his
birth
or
his
family
but
a
shameless
and
savage
barbarian
who
not
long
before
had
been
among
the
captives
of
war
but
all
that
he
did
and
how
he
governed
is
neither
agreeable
for
me
to
tell
nor
would
it
be
and
that
the
emperor
was
justified
in
making
war
on
him
you
have
heard
and
of
his
skill
and
courage
what
i
said
earlier
is
proof
enough
but
deeds
are
i
think
more
convincing
than
words
but
what
happened
after
the
victory
and
how
he
no
longer
made
use
of
the
sword
not
even
against
those
who
were
under
suspicion
of
serious
crimes
or
who
had
been
familiar
friends
of
the
usurper
nay
not
even
against
anyone
who
to
curry
favour
with
the
latter
had
stooped
to
win
a
s
fee
by
slandering
the
emperor
consider
in
the
name
of
zeus
the
god
of
friendship
that
not
even
these
paid
the
penalty
of
their
audacity
except
when
they
were
guilty
of
other
crimes
and
yet
what
a
terrible
thing
is
slander
how
truly
does
it
devour
the
heart
and
wound
the
soul
as
iron
can
not
wound
the
body
this
it
was
that
goaded
odysseus
to
defend
himself
by
word
and
deed
at
any
rate
it
was
for
this
reason
that
he
quarrelled
with
his

was

and
so
it
was
with
alexander
philip
s
son
and
achilles
son
of
thetis
and
others
who
were
not
worthless
or
ignoble
men
but
only
to
socrates
i
think
and
a
few
others
who
emulated
him
men
who
were
truly
fortunate
and
happy
was
it
given
to
put
off
the
last
garment
that
man
love
of
glory
for
resentment
of
calumny
is
due
to
the
passion
for
glory
and
for
this
reason
it
is
implanted
most
deeply
in
the
noblest
souls
for
they
resent
it
as
their
deadliest
foe
and
those
who
hurl
at
them
slanderous
language
they
hate
more
than
men
who
attack
them
with
the
sword
or
plot
their
destruction
and
they
regard
them
as
differing
from
themselves
not
merely
in
their
acquired
habits
but
in
their
essential
nature
seeing
that
they
love
praise
and
honour
and
the
slanderer
not
only
robs
them
of
these
but
also
manufactures
false
accusations
against
them
they
say
that
even
heracles
and
certain
other
heroes
were
swayed
by
these
emotions
but
for
my
part
i
do
not
believe
this
account
of
them
and
as
for
the
emperor
i
have
seen
him
repelling
calumny
with
great
restraint
which
in
my
judgment
is
no
slighter
achievement
than
to
take
troy
or
rout
a
powerful
phalanx
and
if
anyone
does
not
believe
me
and
thinks
it
no
great
achievement
nor
worth
all
these
praises
let
him
observe
himself
when
a
misfortune
of
this
sort
happens
to
him
and
then
let
him
decide
and
i
am
convinced
that
he
will
not
think
that
i
am
talking
with
exceeding
folly

now
since
this
was
and
is
the
emperor
s
behaviour
after
the
war
he
is
naturally
loved
and
longed
for
by
his
friends
since
he
has
admitted
many
of
them
to
honour
and
power
and
freedom
of
speech
and
has
bestowed
on
them
as
well
vast
sums
of
money
and
permits
them
to
use
their
wealth
as
they
please
but
even
to
his
enemies
he
is
the
same
the
following
may
serve
as
a
clear
proof
of
this
those
members
of
the
senate
who
were
of
any
account
and
surpassed
the
rest
in
reputation
and
wealth
and
wisdom
fled
to
the
shelter
of
his
right
hand
as
though
to
a
harbour
and
leaving
behind
their
hearths
and
homes
and
children
preferred
paeonia
to
rome
and
to
be
with
him
rather
than
with
their
dearest
again
a
division
of
the
choicest
of
the
cavalry
together
with
their
standards
and
bringing
their
general
with
them
chose
to
share
danger
with
him
rather
than
success
with
the
usurper
and
all
this
took
place
before
the
battle
on
the
banks
of
the
drave
which
the
earlier
part
of
my
speech
described
to
you
for
after
that
they
began
to
feel
perfect
confidence
though
before
that
it
looked
as
though
the
usurper
s
cause
was
getting
the
upper
hand
when
he
gained
some
slight
advantage
in
the
affair
of
the
emperor
s
scouts
which
indeed
made
the
usurper
beside
himself
with
joy
and
greatly
agitated
those
who
were
incapable
of
grasping
or
estimating
generalship
but
the
emperor
was
unperturbed
and
heroic
like
a
good
pilot
when
a
tempest
has
suddenly
burst
from
the
clouds
and
next
moment
the
god
shakes
the
depths
and
the
shores
then
a
terrible
and
dreadful
panic
seizes
on
those
who
are
inexperienced
but
the
pilot
begins
to
rejoice
and
is
glad
because
he
can
now
hope
for
a
perfect
and
windless
calm
for
it
is
said
that
poseidon
when
he
makes
the
earth
quake
calms
the
waves
and
just
so
fortune
deceives
the
foolish
and
deludes
them
about
more
important
things
by
allowing
them
some
small
advantage
but
in
the
wise
she
inspires
unshaken
confidence
about
more
serious
affairs
even
when
she
disconcerts
them
in
the
case
of
those
that
are
less
serious
this
was
what
happened
to
the
lacedaemonians
at
pylae
but
they
did
not
despair
nor
fear
the
onset
of
the
mede
because
they
had
lost
three
hundred
spartans
and
their
king
at
the
entrance
into
greece
this
often
happened
to
the
romans
but
they
achieved
more
important
successes
later
on
wherefore
since
the
emperor
knew
this
and
counted
on
it
he
in
no
way
wavered
in
his
purpose

but
seeing
that
my
argument
has
of
its
own
accord
once
reached
this
point
and
is
describing
the
affection
that
the
emperor
inspires
in
the
common
people
the
magistrates
and
the
garrisons
who
aid
him
to
protect
the
empire
and
repulse
its
enemies
are
you
willing
that
i
should
relate
to
you
a
signal
proof
of
this
which
happened
one
may
say
yesterday
or
the
day
before
a
certain
man
who
had
been
given
the
command
of
the
garrisons
in
probably
know
his
name
and
his
son
behind
him
as
a
hostage
for
his
friendship
and
loyalty
to
the
emperor
though
not
at
the
emperor
s
request
then
he
proved
to
be
more
treacherous
than
lions
who
have
no
faithful
covenants
with
man
as
the
poet
says
and
plundered
the
cities
of
their
wealth
and
distributed
it
among
the
invading
barbarians
paying
it
down
as
a
sort
of
ransom
though
he
was
well
able
to
take
measures
to
win
security
by
the
sword
rather
than
by
money
but
he
tried
to
win
them
over
to
friendliness
by
means
of
money
and
finally
he
took
from
the
women
s
apartments
a
purple
dress
and
showed
himself
truly
a
tyrant
and
tragical
indeed
then
the
soldiers
resenting
his
treachery
would
not
tolerate
the
sight
of
him
thus
dressed
up
in
women
s
garb
and
they
set
on
the
miserable
wretch
and
tore
him
limb
from
limb
nor
would
they
endure
either
that
the
crescent
moon
should
rule
over
them
now
it
was
the
affection
of
his
garrison
that
gave
the
emperor
this
guerdon
a
wonderful
recompense
for
his
just
and
blameless
rule
but
you
are
eager
to
hear
how
he
behaved
after
this
this
too
however
you
can
not
fail
to
know
that
he
chose
neither
to
be
harsh
towards
that
man
s
son
nor
suspicious
and
formidable
to
his
friends
but
in
the
highest
possible
degree
he
was
merciful
and
kindly
to
them
all
though
many
desired
to
bring
false
accusations
and
had
raised
their
stings
to
strike
the
innocent
but
though
many
were
perhaps
really
involved
in
the
crimes
of
which
they
were
suspected
he
was
merciful
to
all
alike
provided
they
had
not
been
convicted
or
proved
to
be
partners
in
the
usurper
s
monstrous
and
abominable
schemes
and
shall
we
not
declare
that
the
forbearance
shown
by
him
towards
the
son
of
one
who
had
broken
the
laws
and
trampled
on
loyalty
and
sworn
covenants
was
truly
royal
and
godlike
or
shall
we
rather
approve
agamemnon
who
vented
his
rage
and
cruelty
not
only
on
those
trojans
who
had
accompanied
paris
and
had
outraged
the
hearth
of
menelaus
but
even
on
those
who
were
yet
unborn
and
whose
mothers
even
were
perhaps
not
yet
born
when
paris
plotted
the
rape
anyone
therefore
who
thinks
that
cruelty
and
harshness
and
inhumanity
ill
become
a
king
and
that
mercy
and
goodness
and
human
kindness
befit
one
who
takes
no
pleasure
in
acts
of
vengeance
but
grieves
at
the
misfortunes
of
his
subjects
however
they
may
arise
whether
from
their
own
wickedness
and
ignorance
or
aimed
at
them
from
without
by
fate
will
it
is
evident
award
to
the
emperor
the
palm
of
victory
for
bear
in
mind
that
he
was
kinder
and
more
just
to
the
boy
than
his
own
father
and
to
the
usurper
s
friends
he
was
more
loyal
than
he
who
acknowledged
the
tie
of
friendship
for
the
usurper
forsook
them
all
but
the
emperor
saved
them
all
and
if
the
usurper
knowing
all
this
about
the
emperor
s
character
since
he
had
for
a
long
time
been
able
to
observe
it
was
entirely
confident
that
his
son
was
safely
at
anchor
and
his
friends
securely
also
then
he
did
indeed
understand
him
aright
but
he
was
many
times
over
criminal
and
base
and
accursed
for
desiring
to
be
at
enmity
with
such
a
man
and
for
hating
one
whom
he
knew
to
be
so
excellent
and
so
surpassingly
mild
and
for
plotting
against
him
and
trying
to
rob
him
of
what
it
was
a
shame
to
take
from
him
but
if
on
the
other
hand
his
son
s
safety
was
something
that
he
had
never
hoped
for
and
the
safety
of
his
friends
and
kinsfolk
he
had
thought
difficult
or
impossible
and
he
nevertheless
chose
to
be
disloyal
this
is
yet
another
proof
that
he
was
wicked
and
infatuated
and
fiercer
than
a
wild
beast
and
that
the
emperor
was
gentle
and
mild
and
magnanimous
since
he
took
pity
on
the
youth
of
the
helpless
child
and
was
merciful
to
those
who
were
not
proved
guilty
and
ignored
and
despised
the
crimes
of
the
usurper
for
he
who
grants
what
not
one
of
his
enemies
expects
because
the
guilt
that
is
on
their
conscience
is
so
great
beyond
a
doubt
carries
off
the
prize
for
virtue
for
while
he
tempers
justice
with
what
is
nobler
and
more
merciful
in
he
surpasses
those
who
are
merely
moderate
in
their
vengeance
and
in
courage
he
excels
because
he
thinks
no
enemy
worthy
of
notice
and
his
wisdom
he
displays
by
suppressing
enmities
and
by
not
handing
them
down
to
his
sons
and
descendants
on
the
pretext
of
strict
justice
or
of
wishing
and
very
reasonably
too
to
blot
out
the
seed
of
the
wicked
like
the
seed
of
a
for
this
is
the
way
of
those
trees
and
in
consequence
an
ancient
tale
gave
rise
to
this
simile
but
the
good
emperor
closely
imitating
god
knows
that
even
from
rocks
swarms
of
bees
fly
forth
and
that
sweet
fruits
grow
even
from
the
bitterest
wood
pleasant
figs
for
instance
and
from
thorns
the
pomegranate
and
there
are
other
instances
where
things
are
produced
entirely
unlike
the
parents
that
begat
them
and
brought
them
forth
therefore
he
thinks
that
we
ought
not
to
destroy
these
before
they
have
reached
maturity
but
to
wait
for
time
to
pass
and
to
trust
them
to
cast
off
the
folly
and
madness
of
their
fathers
and
become
good
and
temperate
but
that
if
they
should
turn
out
to
emulate
their
fathers
practices
they
will
in
good
time
suffer
punishment
but
they
will
not
have
been
uselessly
sacrificed
because
of
the
deeds
and
misfortunes
of
others

now
do
you
think
i
have
made
my
sincere
panegyric
sufficiently
thorough
and
complete
or
are
you
anxious
to
hear
also
about
the
emperor
s
powers
of
endurance
and
his
august
bearing
and
that
not
only
is
he
unconquerable
by
the
enemy
but
has
never
yet
succumbed
to
any
disgraceful
appetite
and
never
coveted
a
fine
house
or
a
costly
palace
or
a
necklace
of
emeralds
and
then
robbed
their
owners
of
them
either
by
violence
or
persuasion
and
that
he
has
never
coveted
any
woman
or
handmaid
or
pursued
any
dishonourable
passion
and
that
he
does
not
even
desire
an
immoderate
surfeit
of
the
good
things
that
the
seasons
produce
or
care
for
ice
in
summer
or
change
his
residence
with
the
time
of
year
but
is
ever
at
hand
to
aid
those
portions
of
the
empire
that
are
in
trouble
enduring
both
frost
and
extreme
heat
but
if
you
should
bid
me
bring
before
you
plain
proofs
of
this
i
shall
merely
say
what
is
familiar
to
all
and
i
shall
not
lack
evidence
but
the
account
would
be
long
a
monstrous
speech
nor
indeed
have

leisure
to
cultivate

an
extent

the

oration
is
an
expression
of
gratitude

λόγος
to
the
empress
eusebia
the
first
wife
of
constantius
after
julian
s
intractable
gallus
caesar
had
been
murdered
by
the
emperor
he
was
summoned
to
the
court
at
milan
and
there
awkward
and
ill
at
ease
cut
off
from
his
favourite
studies
and
from
the
society
of
philosophers
surrounded
by
intriguing
and
unfriendly
courtiers
and
regarded
with
suspicion
by
the
emperor
julian
was
protected
encouraged
and
advised
by
eusebia
his
praise
and
gratitude
are
for
once
sincere
the
oration
must
have
been
composed
either
in
gaul
or
shortly
before
julian
set
out
thither
after
the
dangerous
dignity
of
the
caesarship
had
been
thrust
upon
him
his
sincerity
has
affected
his
style
which
is
simpler
and
more
direct

that

what
pray
ought
we
to
think
of
those
who
owe
things
of
price
and
beyond
do
not
mean
gold
or
silver
but
simply
any
benefit
one
may
happen
to
receive
from
one
s
that
they
neither
try
nor
intend
to
repay
that
kindness
but
are
indolent
and
do
not
trouble
themselves
to
do
what
they
can
and
try
to
discharge
the
debt
is
it
not
evident
that
we
must
think
them
mean
and
base
far
more
i
think
than
any
other
crime
do
we
hate
ingratitude
and
we
blame
those
persons
who
have
received
benefits
and
are
ungrateful
to
their
benefactors
and
the
ungrateful
man
is
not
only
he
who
repays
a
kindness
with
evil
deeds
or
words
but
also
he
who
is
silent
and
conceals
a
kindness
and
tries
to
consign
it
to
oblivion
and
abolish
gratitude
now
of
such
brutal
and
inhuman
baseness
as
the
repayment
with
evil
the
instances
are
few
and
easily
reckoned
but
there
are
many
who
try
to
conceal
the
appearance
of
having
received
benefits
though
with
what
purpose
i
know
not
they
assert
however
that
it
is
because
they
are
trying
to
avoid
a
reputation
for
a
sort
of
servility
and
for
base
flattery
but
though
i
know
well
enough
that
what
they
say
is
all
insincere
nevertheless
i
let
that
pass
and
suppose
we
assume
that
they
as
they
think
do
escape
an
undeserved
reputation
for
flattery
still
they
at
the
same
time
appear
to
be
guilty
of
many
weaknesses
and
defects
of
character
that
are
in
the
highest
degree
base
and
illiberal
for
either
they
are
too
dense
to
perceive
what
no
one
should
fail
to
perceive
or
they
are
not
dense
but
forgetful
of
what
they
ought
to
remember
for
all
time
or
again
they
do
remember
and
yet
shirk
their
duty
for
some
reason
or
other
being
cowards
and
grudging
by
nature
and
their
hand
is
against
every
man
without
exception
seeing
that
not
even
to
their
benefactors
do
they
consent
to
be
gentle
and
amiable
and
then
if
there
be
any
opening
to
slander
and
bite
they
look
angry
and
fierce
like
wild
beasts
genuine
praise
they
somehow
or
other
avoid
giving
as
though
it
were
a
costly
extravagance
and
they
censure
the
applause
given
to
noble
actions
when
the
only
thing
that
they
need
enquire
into
is
whether
the
eulogists
respect
truth
and
rate
her
higher
than
the
reputation
of
showing
their
gratitude
by
eulogy
for
this
at
any
rate
they
can
not
assert
that
praise
is
a
useless
thing
either
to
those
who
receive
it
or
to
others
besides
who
though
they
have
been
assigned
the
same
rank
in
life
as
the
objects
of
their
praise
have
fallen
short
of
their
merit
in
what
they
have
accomplished
to
the
former
it
is
not
only
agreeable
to
hear
but
makes
them
zealous
to
aim
at
a
still
higher
level
of
conduct
while
the
latter
it
stimulates
both
by
persuasion
and
compulsion
to
imitate
that
noble
conduct
because
they
see
that
none
of
those
who
have
anticipated
them
have
been
deprived
of
that
which
alone
it
is
honourable
to
give
and
receive
publicly
for
to
give
money
openly
and
to
look
anxiously
round
that
as
many
as
possible
may
know
of
the
gift
is
characteristic
of
a
vulgar
person
nay
no
one
would
even
stretch
out
his
hands
to
receive
it
in
the
sight
of
all
men
unless
he
had
first
cast
off
all
propriety
of
manner
and
sense
of
shame
arcesilaus
indeed
when
offering
a
gift
used
to
try
to
hide
his
identity
even
from
the
recipient
but
in
his
case
the
manner
of
the
deed
always
made
known
the
doer
for
a
eulogy
however
one
is
ambitious
to
obtain
as
many
hearers
as
possible
and
even
a
small
audience
is
i
think
not
to
be
despised
socrates
for
instance
spoke
in
praise
of
many
as
did
plato
also
and
aristotle
xenophon
too
eulogised
king
agesilaus
and
cyrus
the
persian
not
only
the
elder
cyrus
but
him
whom
he
accompanied
on
his
campaign
against
the
great
king
nor
did
he
hide
away
his
eulogies
but
put
them
into
his
history
now
i
should
think
it
strange
indeed
if
we
shall
be
eager
to
applaud
men
of
high
character
and
not
think
fit
to
give
our
tribute
of
praise
to
a
noble
woman
believing
as
we
do
that
excellence
is
the
attribute
of
women
no
less
than
of
men
or
shall
we
who
think
that
such
a
one
ought
to
be
modest
and
wise
and
competent
to
assign
to
every
man
his
due
and
brave
in
danger
minded
and
generous
and
that
in
a
word
all
such
qualities
as
these
should
be
hers
we
i
say
then
rob
her
of
the
encomium
due
to
her
good
deeds
from
any
fear
of
the
charge
of
appearing
to
flatter
but
homer
was
not
ashamed
to
praise
penelope
and
the
consort
of
alcinous
and
other
women
of
exceptional
goodness
or
even
those
whose
claim
to
virtue
was
slight
nay
nor
did
penelope
fail
to
obtain
her
share
of
praise
for
this
very
thing
but
besides
these
reasons
for
praise
shall
we
consent
to
accept
kind
treatment
from
a
woman
no
less
than
from
a
man
and
to
obtain
some
boon
whether
small
or
great
and
then
hesitate
to
pay
the
thanks
due
therefor
but
perhaps
people
will
say
that
the
very
act
of
making
a
request
to
a
woman
is
despicable
and
unworthy
of
an
honourable
and
spirited
man
and
that
even
the
wise
odysseus
was
spiritless
and
cowardly
because
he
was
a
suppliant
to
the
king
s
daughter
as
she
played
with
her
maiden
companions
by
the
banks
of
the
river
perhaps
they
will
not
spare
even
athene
the
daughter
of
zeus
of
whom
homer
says
that
she
put
on
the
likeness
of
a
fair
and
noble
maiden
and
guided
him
along
the
road
that
led
to
the
palace
and
was
his
adviser
and
instructed
him
what
he
must
do
and
say
when
he
had
entered
within
and
that
like
some
orator
perfect
in
the
art
of
rhetoric
she
sang
an
encomium
of
the
queen
and
for
a
prelude
told
the
tale
of
her
lineage
from
of
old
homer
s
verses
about
this
are

now
though
i
have
much
that
is
highly
honourable
to
say
about
her
native
land
i
think
it
well
to
omit
part
because
of
its
antiquity
for
it
seems
to
be
not
far
removed
from
myth
for
instance
the
sort
of
story
that
is
told
about
the
muses
that
they
actually
came
from
pieria
and
that
it
was
not
from
helicon
that
they
came
to
olympus
when
summoned
to
their
father
s
side
this
then
and
all
else
of
the
same
sort
since
it
is
better
suited
to
a
fable
than
to
my
narrative
must
be
omitted
but
perhaps
it
is
not
out
of
the
way
nor
alien
from
my
present
theme
to
tell
some
of
the
facts
that
are
not
familiar
to
all
they
say
that
macedonia
was
colonised
by
the
descendants
of
heracles
the
sons
of
temenus
who
had
been
awarded
argos
as
their
portion
then
quarrelled
and
to
make
an
end
of
their
strife
and
jealousy
led
out
a
colony
then
they
seized
macedonia
and
leaving
a
prosperous
family
behind
them
they
succeeded
to
the
throne
king
after
king
as
though
the
privilege
were
an
inheritance
now
to
praise
all
these
would
be
neither
truthful
nor
in
my
opinion
easy
but
though
many
of
them
were
brave
men
and
left
behind
them
very
glorious
monuments
of
the
hellenic
character
philip
and
his
son
surpassed
in
valour
all
who
of
old
ruled
over
macedonia
and
thrace
yes
and
i
should
say
all
who
governed
the
lydians
as
well
or
the
medes
and
persians
and
assyrians
except
only
the
son
of
cambyses
who
transferred
the
sovereignty
from
the
medes
to
the
persians
for
philip
was
the
first
to
try
to
increase
the
power
of
the
macedonians
and
when
he
had
subdued
the
greater
part
of
europe
he
made
the
sea
his
frontier
limit
on
the
east
and
south
and
on
the
north
i
think
the
danube
and
on
the
west
the
people
of
oricus
and
after
him
his
son
who
was
bred
up
at
the
feet
of
the
wise
stagyrite
so
far
excelled
all
the
rest
in
greatness
of
soul
and
besides
surpassed
his
own
father
in
generalship
and
courage
and
the
other
virtues
that
he
thought
that
life
for
him
was
not
worth
living
unless
he
could
subdue
all
men
and
all
nations
and
so
he
traversed
the
whole
of
asia
conquering
as
he
went
and
he
was
the
first
of
men
to
adore
the
rising
sun
but
as
he
was
setting
out
for
europe
in
order
to
gain
control
of
the
remainder
and
so
become
master
of
the
whole
earth
and
sea
he
paid
the
debt
of
nature
in
babylon
then
macedonians
became
the
rulers
of
all
the
cities
and
nations
that
they
had
acquired
under
his
leadership
and
now
is
it
still
necessary
to
show
by
stronger
proofs
that
macedonia
was
famous
and
great
of
old
and
the
most
important
place
in
macedonia
is
that
city
which
they
restored
after
i
think
the
fall
of
the
thessalians
and
which
is
called
after
their
victory
over
them
but
concerning
all
this
i
need
not
speak
at
greater
length

and
of

noble
birth
why
should
i
take
any
further
trouble
to
seek
for
clearer
or
more
manifest
proof
than
this
i
mean
that
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
man
who
was
considered
worthy
to
hold
the
office
that
gives
its
name
to
the
year
an
office
that
in
the
past
was
powerful
and
actually
called
royal
but
lost
that
title
because
of
those
who
abused
their
power
but
now
that
in
these
days
its
power
has
waned
since
the
government
has
changed
to
a
monarchy
the
bare
honour
though
robbed
of
all
the
rest
is
held
to
counterbalance
all
power
and
for
private
citizens
is
set
up
as
a
sort
of
prize
and
a
reward
of
virtue
or
loyalty
or
of
some
favour
done
to
the
ruler
of
the
empire
or
for
some
brilliant
exploit
while
for
the
emperors
it
is
added
to
the
advantages
they
already
possess
as
the
crowning
glory
and
adornment
for
all
the
other
titles
and
functions
that
still
retain
some
feeble
and
shadowy
resemblance
to
the
ancient
constitution
they
either
altogether
despised
and
rejected
because
of
their
absolute
power
or
they
attached
them
to
themselves
and
enjoy
the
titles
for
life
but
this
office
alone
i
think
they
from
the
first
did
not
despise
and
it
still
gratifies
them
when
they
obtain
it
for
the
year
indeed
there
is
no
private
citizen
or
emperor
nor
has
ever
been
who
did
not
think
it
an
enviable
distinction
to
be
entitled
consul
and
if
there
be
anyone
who
thinks
that
because
he
i
spoke
of
was
the
first
of
his
line
to
win
that
title
and
to
lay
the
foundations
of
distinction
for
his
family
he
is
therefore
inferior
to
the
others
he
fails
to
understand
that
he
is
deceived
exceedingly
for
it
is
in
my
opinion
altogether
nobler
and
more
honourable
to
lay
the
foundations
of
such
great
distinction
for
one
s
descendants
than
to
receive
it
from
one
s
ancestors
for
indeed
it
is
a
nobler
thing
to
be
the
founder
of
a
mighty
city
than
a
mere
citizen
and
to
receive
any
good
thing
is
altogether
less
dignified
than
to
give
indeed
it
is
evident
that
sons
receive
from
their
fathers
and
citizens
from
their
cities
a
start
as
it
were
on
the
path
of
glory
but
he
who
by
his
own
effort
pays
back
to
his
ancestors
and
his
native
land
that
honour
on
a
higher
scale
and
makes
his
country
show
more
brilliant
and
more
distinguished
and
his
ancestors
more
illustrious
clearly
yields
the
prize
to
no
man
on
the
score
of
native
nobility
nor
is
there
any
man
who
can
claim
to
be
superior
to
him
i
speak
of
for
the
good
must
needs
be
born
of
good
parents
but
when
the
son
of
illustrious
parents
himself
becomes
more
illustrious
and
fortune
blows
the
same
way
as
his
merit
he
causes
no
one
to
feel
doubt
if
he
lays
claim
as
is
reasonable
to
be
of
native
nobility

but
of
all
those
combined
gifts
which
she
who
is
united
to
so
great
an
emperor
ought
to
bring
with
her
from
her
home
as
a
dowry
wit
and
wisdom
a
body
in
the
flower
of
youth
and
beauty
so
conspicuous
as
to
throw
into
the
shade
all
other
maidens
beside
even
as
i
believe
the
radiant
stars
about
the
moon
at
the
full
are
outshone
and
hide
their
shape
for
no
single
one
of
these
endowments
is
thought
to
suffice
for
an
alliance
with
an
emperor
but
all
together
as
though
some
god
were
fashioning
for
a
virtuous
emperor
a
fair
and
modest
bride
were
united
in
her
single
person
and
attracting
not
his
eyes
alone
brought
from
afar
that
bridegroom
blest
of
heaven
for
beauty
alone
if
it
lacks
the
support
of
birth
and
the
other
advantages
i
have
mentioned
is
not
enough
to
induce
even
a
licentious
man
a
mere
citizen
to
kindle
the
marriage
torch
though
both
combined
have
brought
about
many
a
match
but
when
they
occur
without
sweetness
and
charm
of
character
they
are
seen
to
be
far
from
desirable

i
have
good
reason
to
say
that
the
emperor
in
his
prudence
understood
this
clearly
and
that
it
was
only
after
long
deliberation
that
he
chose
this
marriage
partly
making
enquiries
about
all
that
was
needful
to
learn
about
her
by
hearsay
but
judging
also
from
her
mother
of
the
daughter
s
noble
disposition
of
that
mother
why
should
i
take
time
to
say
more
as
though
i
had
not
to
recite
a
special
encomium
on
her
who
is
the
theme
of
my
speech
but
so
much
perhaps
i
may
say
briefly
and
you
may
hear
without
weariness
that
her
family
is
entirely
greek
yes
greek
of
the
purest
stock
and
her
native
city
was
the
metropolis
of
macedonia
and
she
was
more
than
evadne
the
wife
of
capaneus
and
the
famous
laodameia
of
thessaly
for
these
two
when
they
had
lost
their
husbands
who
were
young
handsome
and
still
whether
by
the
constraint
of
some
envious
powers
or
because
the
threads
of
the
fates
were
so
woven
threw
away
their
lives
for
love
but
the
mother
of
the
empress
when
his
fate
had
come
upon
her
wedded
lord
devoted
herself
to
her
children
and
won
a
great
reputation
for
prudence
so
great
indeed
that
whereas
penelope
while
her
husband
was
still
on
his
travels
and
wanderings
was
beset
by
those
young
suitors
who
came
to
woo
her
from
ithaca
and
samos
and
dulichium
that
lady
no
man
however
fair
and
tall
or
powerful
and
wealthy
ever
ventured
to
approach
with
any
such
proposals
and
her
daughter
the
emperor
deemed
worthy
to
live
by
his
side
and
after
setting
up
the
trophies
of
his
victories
he
celebrated
the
marriage
with
great
splendour
feasting
nations
and
cities
and
peoples

but
should
any
haply
desire
to
hear
of
such
things
as
how
the
bride
was
bidden
to
come
from
macedonia
with
her
mother
and
what
was
the
manner
of
the
cavalcade
of
the
chariots
and
horses
and
carriages
of
all
sorts
decorated
with
gold
and
silver
and
copper
of
the
finest
workmanship
let
me
tell
him
that
it
is
extremely
childish
of
him
to
wish
to
hear
such
things
it
is
like
the
case
of
some
player
on
the
cithara
who
is
an
accomplished
us
say
if
you
please
terpander
or
he
of
methymna
of
whom
the
story
goes
that
he
enjoyed
a
divine
escort
and
found
that
the
dolphin
cared
more
for
music
than
did
his
and
was
thus
conveyed
safely
to
the
laconian
promontory
for
though
he
did
indeed
charm
those
miserable
sailors
by
his
skilful
performance
yet
they
despised
his
art
and
paid
no
heed
to
his
music
now
as
i
was
going
to
say
if
some
one
were
to
choose
the
best
of
those
two
musicians
and
were
to
clothe
him
in
the
raiment
suited
to
his
art
and
were
then
to
bring
him
into
a
theatre
full
of
men
women
and
children
of
all
sorts
varying
in
temperament
and
age
and
habits
besides
do
you
not
suppose
that
the
children
and
those
of
the
men
and
women
who
had
childish
tastes
would
gaze
at
his
dress
and
his
lyre
and
be
marvellously
smitten
with
his
appearance
while
the
more
ignorant
of
the
men
and
the
whole
crowd
of
women
except
a
very
few
would
judge
his
playing
simply
by
the
criterion
of
pleasure
or
the
reverse
whereas
a
musical
man
who
understood
the
rules
of
the
art
would
not
endure
that
the
melodies
should
be
wrongly
mixed
for
the
sake
of
giving
pleasure
but
would
resent
it
if
the
player
did
not
preserve
the
modes
of
the
music
and
did
not
use
the
harmonies
properly
and
conformably
to
the
laws
of
genuine
and
inspired
music
but
if
he
saw
that
he
was
faithful
to
the
principles
of
his
art
and
produced
in
the
audience
a
pleasure
that
was
not
spurious
but
pure
and
uncontaminated
he
would
go
home
praising
the
musician
and
filled
with
admiration
because
his
performance
in
the
theatre
was
artistic
and
did
the
muses
no
wrong
but
such
a
man
thinks
that
anyone
who
praises
the
purple
raiment
and
the
lyre
is
foolish
and
out
of
his
mind
while
if
he
goes
on
to
give
full
details
about
such
outward
things
adorning
them
with
an
agreeable
style
and
smoothing
away
all
that
is
worthless
and
vulgar
in
the
tale
then
the
critic
thinks
him
more
ridiculous
than
those
who
try
to
carve
stones
as
i
believe
is
related
of
myrmecides
who
thus
sought
to
rival
the
art
of
pheidias
and
so
neither
will
i
if
i
can
help
it
lay
myself
open
to
this
charge
by
reciting
the
long
list
of
costly
robes
and
gifts
of
all
kinds
and
necklaces
and
garlands
that
were
sent
by
the
emperor
nor
how
the
folk
in
each
place
came
to
meet
her
with
welcome
and
rejoicing
nor
all
the
glorious
and
auspicious
incidents
that
occurred
on
that
journey
and
were
reported
but
when
she
entered
the
palace
and
was
honoured
with
her
imperial
title
what
was
the
first
thing
she
did
and
then
the
second
and
the
third
and
the
many
actions
that
followed
for
however
much
i
might
wish
to
tell
of
them
and
to
compose
lengthy
volumes
about
them
i
think
that
for
the
majority
those
of
her
deeds
will
be
sufficient
that
more
conspicuously
witnessed
to
her
wisdom
and
clemency
and
modesty
and
benevolence
and
goodness
and
generosity
and
her
other
virtues
than
does
now
the
present
account
of
her
which
tries
to
enlighten
and
instruct
those
who
have
long
known
it
all
from
personal
experience
for
it
would
not
be
at
all
proper
merely
because
the
task
has
proved
to
be
difficult
or
rather
impossible
to
keep
silence
about
the
whole
but
one
should
rather
try
as
far
as
one
can
to
tell
about
those
deeds
and
to
bring
forward
as
a
proof
of
her
wisdom
and
of
all
her
other
virtues
the
fact
that
she
made
her
husband
regard
her
as
it
is
fitting
that
he
should
regard
a
beautiful
and
noble
wife

to
suffer

terrible
hardships

by

had

him

o

one
must
call
you
did
you
endure
so
many
toils
when
you
might
have
been
prosperous

happy
and
perhaps
even
immortal
if
one
may
at
all
believe
the
promises
of
calypso
but
you
chose
the
worse
instead
of
the
better
and
imposed
on
yourself
all
those
hardships
and
refused
to
remain
even
in
scheria
though
you
might
surely
have
rested
there
from
your
wandering
and
been
delivered
from
your
perils
but
behold
you
resolved
to
carry
on
the
war
in
your
own
house
and
to
perform
feats
of
valour
and
to
accomplish
a
second
journey
not
less
toilsome
as
seemed
likely
nor
easier
than
the
first
what
answer
then
do
you
think
he
would
give
to
this
would
he
not
answer

he
longed
always
to
be
with
penelope
and
that
those
contests
and
campaigns
he
purposed
to
take
back
to
her
as
a
pleasant
tale
to
tell
for
this
reason
then
he
makes
his
mother
exhort
him
to
remember
everything
all
the
sights
he
saw

all
the
things

heard

and
indeed
he
forgot
nothing
and
no
sooner
had
he
come
home
and
vanquished
as
was
just
the
youths
who
caroused
in
the
palace
than
he
related
all
to
her
without
pause
all
that
he
had
achieved
and
endured
and
all
else
that
obeying
the
oracles
he
purposed
still
to
accomplish
and
from
her
he
kept
nothing
secret
but
chose
that
she
should
be
the
partner
of
his
counsels
and
should
help
him
to
plan
and
contrive
what
he
must
do
and
do
you
think
this
a
trifling
tribute
to
penelope
or
is
there
not
now
found
to
be
yet
another
woman
whose
virtue
surpasses
hers
and
who
as
the
consort
of
a
brave
magnanimous
and
prudent
emperor
has
won
as
great
affection
from
her
husband
since
she
has
mingled
with
the
tenderness
that
is
inspired
by
love
that
other
which
good
and
noble
souls
derive
from
their
own
virtue
whence
it
flows
like
a
sacred
fount
for
there
are
two
jars
so
to
speak
of
these
two
kinds
of
human
affection
and
eusebia
drew
in
equal
measure
from
both
and
so
has
come
to
be
the
partner
of
her
husband
s
counsels
and
though
the
emperor
is
by
nature
merciful
good
and
wise
she
encourages
him
to
follow
yet
more
becomingly
his
natural
bent
and
ever
turns
justice
to
mercy
so
that
no
one
could
ever
cite
a
case
in
which
this
empress
whether
with
justice
as
might
happen
or
unjustly
has
ever
been
the
cause
of
punishment
or
chastisement
either
great
or
small
now
we
are
told
that
at
athens
in
the
days
when
they
employed
their
ancestral
customs
and
lived
in
obedience
to
their
own
laws
as
the
inhabitants
of
a
great
and
humane
city
whenever
the
votes
of
the
jurymen
were
cast
evenly
for
defendant
and
plaintiff
the
vote
of
athene
was
awarded
to
him
who
would
have
incurred
the
penalty
and
thus
both
were
acquitted
of
guilt
he
who
had
brought
the
accusation
of
the
reputation
of
sycophant
and
the
defendant
naturally
of
the
guilt
of
the
crime
now
this
humane
and
gracious
custom
is
kept
up
in
the
suits
which
the
emperor
judges
but
eusebia
s
mercy
goes
further
for
whenever
the
defendant
comes
near
to
obtaining
an
equal
number
of
votes
she
persuades
the
emperor
adding
her
request
and
entreaty
on
his
behalf
to
acquit
the
man
entirely
of
the
charge
and
of
free
will
with
willing
heart
he
grants
the
boon
and
does
not
give
it
as
homer
says
zeus
constrained
by
his
wife
agreed
as
to
what
he
should
concede
to
her
of
free
will
but
with
soul
and
perhaps
it
is
not
strange
that
he
should
concede
this
pardon
reluctantly
and
under
protest
in
the
case
of
the
violent
and
depraved
but
not
even
when
men
richly
deserve
to
suffer
and
be
punished
ought
they
to
be
utterly
ruined
now
since
the
empress
recognises
this
she
has
never
bidden
him
inflict
any
injury
of
any
kind
or
any
punishment
or
chastisement
even
on
a
single
household
of
the
citizens
much
less
on
a
whole
kingdom
or
city
and
i
might
add
with
the
utmost
confidence
that
i
am
speaking
the
absolute
truth
that
in
the
case
of
no
man
or
woman
is
it
possible
to
charge
her
with
any
misfortune
that
has
happened
but
all
the
benefits
that
she
confers
and
has
conferred
and
on
whom
i
would
gladly
recount
in
as
many
cases
as
possible
and
report
them
one
by
one
how
for
instance
this
man
thanks
to
her
enjoys
his
ancestral
estate
and
that
man
has
been
saved
from
punishment
though
he
was
guilty
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
how
a
third
escaped
a
malicious
prosecution
though
he
came
within
an
ace
of
the
danger
how
countless
persons
have
received
honour
and
office
at
her
hands
and
on
this
subject
there
is
no
one
of
them
all
who
will
assert
that
i
speak
falsely
even
though
i
should
not
give
a
list
of
those
persons
by
name
but
this
i
hesitate
to
do
lest
i
should
seem
to
some
to
be
reproaching
them
with
their
sufferings
and
to
be
composing
not
so
much
an
encomium
of
her
good
deeds
as
a
catalogue
of
the
misfortunes
of
others
and
yet
not
to
cite
any
of
these
acts
of
hers
and
to
bring
no
proof
of
them
before
the
public
seems
perhaps
to
imply
that
they
are
lacking
and
brings
discredit
on
my
encomium
accordingly
to
deprecate
that
charge
i
shall
relate
so
much
as
it
is
not
invidious
for
me
to
speak
or
for
her
to
hear

it
was
their
merit
far
more
than
the
ties
of
kinship
that
she
rewarded
and
one
could
hardly
pay
her
a
higher
compliment
than
that
such
then
was
her
treatment
of
these
and
to
all
who
since
they
were
still
obscure
on
account
of
their
youth
needed
recognition
of
any
sort
she
awarded
lesser
honours
in
fact
she
left
nothing
undone
to
help
one
and
all
and
not
only
on
her
kinsfolk
has
she
conferred
such
benefits
but
whenever
she
learned
that
ties
of
friendship
used
to
exist
with
her
ancestors
she
has
not
allowed
it
to
be
unprofitable
to
those
who
owned
such
ties
but
she
honours
them
i
understand
no
less
than
her
own
kinsfolk
and
to
all
whom
she
regards
as
her
father
s
friends
she
dispensed
wonderful
rewards
for
their
friendship

but
since
i
see
that
my
account
is
in
need
of
proofs
just
as
in
a
court
i
will
offer
myself
to
bear
witness
on
its
behalf
to
these
actions
and
to
applaud
them
but
lest
you
should
mistrust
my
evidence
and
cause
a
disturbance
before
you
have
heard
what
i
have
to
say
i
swear
that
i
will
tell
you
no
falsehood
or
fiction
although
you
would
have
believed
even
without
an
oath
that
i
am
saying
all
this
without
intent
to
flatter
for
i
already
possess
by
the
grace
of
god
and
the
emperor
and
because
the
empress
too
was
zealous
in
my
behalf
all
those
blessings
to
gain
which
a
flatterer
would
leave
nothing
unsaid
so
that
if
i
were
speaking
before
obtaining
these
perhaps
i
should
have
to
dread
that
unjust
suspicion
but
as
it
is
since
this
is
the
state
of
my
fortunes
i
will
recall
her
conduct
to
me
and
at
the
same
time
give
you
a
proof
of
my
own
mindedness
and
truthful
evidence
of
her
good
deeds
i
have
heard
that
darius
while
he
was
still
in
the
bodyguard
of
the
persian
monarch
met
in
egypt
a
samian
stranger
who
was
an
exile
from
his
own
country
and
accepted
from
him
the
gift
of
a
scarlet
cloak
to
which
darius
had
taken
a
great
fancy
and
that
later
on
in
the
days
when
i
understand
he
had
become
the
master
of
all
asia
he
gave
him
in
return
the
tyranny
of
samos
and
now
suppose
that
i
acknowledge
that
though
i
received
many
kindnesses
at
eusebia
s
hands
at
a
time
when
i
was
still
permitted
to
live
in
peaceful
obscurity
and
many
also
by
her
intercession
from
our
noble
and
magnanimous
emperor
i
must
needs
fall
short
of
making
an
equal
return
for
as
i
know
she
possesses
everything
already
as
the
gift
of
him
who
was
so
generous
to
myself
yet
since
i
desire
that
the
memory
of
her
good
deeds
should
be
immortal
and
since
i
am
relating
them
to
you
perhaps
i
shall
not
be
thought
less
mindful
of
my
debt
than
the
persian
seeing
that
in
forming
a
judgment
it
is
to
the
intention
that
one
must
look
and
not
to
an
instance
in
which
fortune
granted
a
man
the
power
to
repay
his
obligation

why
then
i
say
that
i
have
been
so
kindly
treated
and
in
return
for
what
i
acknowledge
that
i
am
her
debtor
for
all
time
that
is
what
you
are
eager
to
hear
nor
shall
i
conceal
the
facts
the
emperor
was
kind
to
me
almost
from
my
infancy
and
he
surpassed
all
generosity
for
he
snatched
me
from
dangers
so
great
that
not
even
a
man
in
the
strength
of
his
youth
could
easily
have
escaped
them
unless
he
obtained
some
means
of
safety
sent
by
heaven
and
not
attainable
by
human
means
and
after
my
house
had
been
seized
by
one
of
those
in
power
as
though
there
were
none
to
defend
it
he
recovered
it
for
me
as
was
just
and
made
it
wealthy
once
more
and
i
could
tell
you
of
still
other
kindnesses
on
his
part
towards
myself
that
deserve
all
gratitude
in
return
for
which
i
ever
showed
myself
loyal
and
faithful
to
him
but
nevertheless
of
late
i
perceived
that
i
know
not
why
he
was
somewhat
harsh
towards
me
now
the
empress
no
sooner
heard
a
bare
mention
not
of
any
actual
but
of
mere
idle
suspicion
than
she
deigned
to
investigate
it
and
before
doing
so
would
not
admit
or
listen
to
any
falsehood
or
unjust
slander
but
persisted
in
her
request
until
she
brought
me
into
the
emperor
s
presence
and
procured
me
speech
with
him
and
she
rejoiced
when
i
was
acquitted
of
every
unjust
charge
and
when
i
wished
to
return
home
she
first
persuaded
the
emperor
to
give
his
permission
and
then
furnished
me
with
a
safe
escort
then
when
some
deity
the
one
i
think
who
devised
my
former
troubles
or
perhaps
some
unfriendly
chance
cut
short
this
journey
she
sent
me
to
visit
greece
having
asked
this
favour
on
my
behalf
from
the
emperor
when
i
had
already
left
the
country
this
was
because
she
had
learned
that
i
delighted
in
literature
and
she
knew
that
that
place
is
the
home
of
culture
then
indeed
i
prayed
first
as
is
meet
for
the
emperor
and
next
for
eusebia
that
god
would
grant
them
many
blessings
because
when
i
longed
and
desired
to
behold
my
true
fatherland
they
made
it
possible
for
we
who
dwell
in
thrace
and
ionia
are
the
sons
of
hellas
and
all
of
us
who
are
not
devoid
of
feeling
long
to
greet
our
ancestors
and
to
embrace
the
very
soil
of
hellas
so
this
had
long
been
as
was
natural
my
dearest
wish
and
i
desired
it
more
than
to
possess
treasures
of
gold
and
silver
for
i
consider
that
intercourse
with
distinguished
men
when
weighed
in
the
balance
with
any
amount
whatever
of
gold
drags
down
the
beam
and
does
not
permit
a
prudent
judge
even
to
hesitate
over
a
slight
turn
of
the
scale

now
as
regards

and
philosophy
the
condition
of
greece
in
our
day
reminds
one
somewhat
of
the
tales
and
traditions
of
the
egyptians
for
the
egyptians
say
that
the
nile
in
their
country
is
not
only
the
saviour
and
benefactor
of
the
land
but
also
wards
off
destruction
by
fire
when
the
sun
throughout
long
periods
in
conjunction
or
combination
with
fiery
constellations
fills
the
atmosphere
with
heat
and
scorches
everything
for
it
has
not
power
enough
so
they
say
to
evaporate
or
exhaust
the
fountains
of
the
nile
and
so
too
neither
from
the
greeks
has
philosophy
altogether
departed
nor
has
she
forsaken
athens
or
sparta
or
corinth
and
as
regards
these
fountains
argos
can
by
no
means
be
called
thirsty
for
there
are
many
in
the
city
itself
and
many
also
south
of
the
city
round
about
mases
famous
of
old
yet
sicyon
not
corinth
possesses
peirene
itself
and
athens
has
many
such
streams
pure
and
springing
from
the
soil
and
many
flow
into
the
city
from
abroad
but
no
less
precious
than
those
that
are
native
and
her
people
love
and
cherish
them
and
desire
to
be
rich
in
that
which
alone
makes
wealth
enviable

but
as
for
me
what
has
come
over
me
and
what
speech
do
i
intend
to
achieve
if
not
a
panegyric
of
my
beloved
hellas
of
which
one
can
not
make
mention
without
admiring
everything
but
perhaps
someone
remembering
what
i
said
earlier
will
say
that
this
is
not
what
i
intended
to
discuss
when
i
began
and
that
just
as
corybants
when
excited
by
the
flute
dance
and
leap
without
method
so
i
spurred
on
by
the
mention
of
my
beloved
city
am
chanting
the
praises
of
that
country
and
her
people
to
him
i
must
make
excuse
somewhat
as
follows
good
sir
you
who
are
the
guide
to
an
art
that
is
genuinely
noble
that
is
a
wise
notion
of
yours
for
you
do
not
permit
or
grant
one
to
let
go
even
for
a
moment
the
theme
of
a
panegyric
seeing
that
you
yourself
maintain
your
theme
with
skill
yet
in
my
case
since
there
has
come
over
me
this
impulse
of
affection
which
you
say
is
to
blame
for
the
lack
of
order
in
my
arguments
you
really
urge
me
i
think
not
to
be
too
much
afraid
of
it
or
to
take
precautions
against
criticism
for
i
am
not
embarking
on
irrelevant
themes
if
i
wish
to
show
how
great
were
the
blessings
that
eusebia
procured
for
me
because
she
honoured
the
name
of
philosophy
and
yet
the
name
of
philosopher
which
has
been
i
know
not
why
applied
to
myself
is
really
in
my
case
nothing
but
a
name
and
lacks
reality
for
though
i
love
the
reality
and
am
terribly
enamoured
of
the
thing
itself
yet
for
some
reason
i
have
fallen
short
of
it
but
eusebia
honoured
even
the
name
for
no
other
reason
can
i
discover
nor
learn
from
anyone
else
why
she
became
so
zealous
an
ally
of
mine
and
an
averter
of
evil
and
my
preserver
and
took
such
trouble
and
pains
in
order
that
i
might
retain
unaltered
and
unaffected
our
noble
emperor
s
and
i
have
never
been
convicted
of
thinking
that
there
is
any
greater
blessing
in
this
world
than
that
since
all
the
gold
above
the
earth
or
beneath
the
earth
is
not
worth
so
much
nor
all
the
mass
of
silver
that
is
now
beneath
the
sun
s
rays
or
may
be
added
thereto
not
though
the
loftiest
mountains
let
us
suppose
stones
and
trees
and
all
were
to
change
to
that
substance
nor
the
greatest
sovereignty
there
is
nor
anything
else
in
the
whole
world
and
i
do
indeed
owe
it
to
her
that
these
blessings
are
mine
so
many
and
greater
than
anyone
could
have
hoped
for
for
in
truth
i
did
not
ask
for
much
nor
did
i
nourish
myself
with
any
such
hopes

but
genuine
kindness
one
can
not
obtain
in
exchange
for
money
nor
could
anyone
purchase
it
by
such
means
but
it
exists
only
when
men
of
noble
character
work
in
harmony
with
a
sort
of
divine
and
higher
providence
and
this
the
emperor
bestowed
on
me
even
as
a
child
and
when
it
had
almost
vanished
it
was
restored
again
to
me
because
the
empress
defended
me
and
warded
off
those
false
and
monstrous
suspicions
and
when
using
the
evidence
of
my
life
as
plain
proof
she
had
completely
cleared
me
of
them
and
i
obeyed
once
more
the
emperor
s
summons
from
greece
did
she
ever
forsake
me
as
though
now
that
all
enmity
and
suspicion
had
been
removed
i
no
longer
needed
much
assistance
would
my
conduct
be
pious
if
i
kept
silence
and
concealed
actions
so
manifest
and
so
honourable
for
when
a
good
opinion
of
me
was
established
in
the
emperor
s
mind
she
rejoiced
exceedingly
and
echoed
him
harmoniously
bidding
me
take
courage
and
neither
refuse
out
of
awe
to
accept
the
greatness
of
what
was
offered
to
me
nor
by
employing
a
boorish
and
arrogant
frankness
unworthily
slight
the
urgent
request
of
him
who
had
shown
me
such
favour
and
so
i
obeyed
though
it
was
by
no
means
agreeable
to
me
to
support
this
burden
and
besides
i
knew
well
that
to
refuse
was
altogether
impracticable
for
when
those
who
have
the
power
to
exact
by
force
what
they
wish
condescend
to
entreat
naturally
they
put
one
out
of
countenance
and
there
is
nothing
left
but
to
obey
now
when
i
consented
i
had
to
change
my
mode
of
dress
and
my
attendants
and
my
habitual
pursuits
and
my
very
house
and
way
of
life
for
what
seemed
full
of
pomp
and
ceremony
to
one
whose
past
had
naturally
been
so
modest
and
humble
and
my
mind
was
confused
by
the
strangeness
though
it
was
certainly
not
dazzled
by
the
magnitude
of
the
favours
that
were
now
mine
for
in
my
ignorance
i
hardly
regarded
them
as
great
blessings
but
rather
as
powers
of
the
greatest
benefit
certainly
to
those
who
use
them
aright
but
when
mistakes
are
made
in
their
use
as
being
harmful
to
many
houses
and
cities
and
the
cause
of
countless
disasters
so
i
felt
like
a
man
who
is
altogether
unskilled
in
driving
a
chariot
and
is
not
at
all
inclined
to
acquire
the
art
and
then
is
compelled
to
manage
a
car
that
belongs
to
a
noble
and
talented
charioteer
one
who
keeps
many
pairs
and
many
too
let
us
suppose
and
has
mounted
behind
them
all
and
because
of
his
natural
talent
and
uncommon
strength
has
a
strong
grip
on
the
reins
of
all
of
them
even
though
he
is
mounted
on
one
chariot
yet
he
does
not
always
remain
on
it
but
often
moves
to
this
side
or
that
and
changes
from
car
to
car
whenever
he
perceives
that
his
horses
are
distressed
or
are
getting
out
of
hand
and
among
these
chariots
he
has
a
team
of
four
that
become
restive
from
ignorance
and
high
spirit
and
are
oppressed
by
continuous
hard
work
but
none
the
less
are
mindful
of
that
high
spirit
and
ever
grow
more
unruly
and
are
irritated
by
their
distress
so
that
they
grow
more
restive
and
disobedient
and
pull
against
the
driver
and
refuse
to
go
in
a
certain
direction
and
unless
they
see
the
charioteer
himself
or
at
least
some
man
wearing
the
dress
of
a
charioteer
end
by
becoming
violent
so
unreasoning
are
they
by
nature
but
when
the
charioteer
encourages
some
unskilful
man
and
sets
him
over
them
and
allows
him
to
wear
the
same
dress
as
his
own
and
invests
him
with
the
outward
seeming
of
a
splendid
and
skilful
charioteer
then
if
he
be
altogether
foolish
and
witless
he
rejoices
and
is
glad
and
is
buoyed
up
and
exalted
by
those
robes
as
though
by
wings
but
if
he
has
even
a
small
share
of
common
sense
and
prudent
understanding
he
is
very
much
alarmed
μήπως
αὑτὸν

τρώσῃ

ἄξῃ
lest
he
both
injure
himself
and
shatter
his
chariot
withal

and
so
cause
loss
to
the
charioteer
and
bring
on
himself
shameful
and
inglorious
disaster
on
all
this
then
i
reflected
taking
counsel
with
myself
in
the
night
season
and
in
the
daytime
pondering
it
with
myself
and
i
was
continually
thoughtful
and
gloomy
then
the
noble
and
truly
godlike
emperor
lessened
my
torment
in
every
way
and
showed
me
honour
and
favour
both
in
deed
and
word
and
at
last
he
bade
me
address
myself
to
the
empress
inspiring
me
with
courage
and
giving
me
a
very
generous
indication
that
i
might
trust
her
completely
now
when
first
i
came
into
her
presence
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
i
beheld
a
statue
of
modesty
set
up
in
some
temple
then
reverence
filled
my
soul
and
my
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
ground
for
some
considerable
time
till
she
bade
me
take
courage
then
she
said
certain
favours
you
have
already
received
from
us
and
yet
others
you
shall
receive
if
god
will
if
only
you
prove
to
be
loyal
and
honest
towards
this
was
almost
as
much
as
i
heard
for
she
herself
did
not
say
more
and

and
twenty
caldrons
but
i
have
no
time
to
gossip
about
such
subjects
nevertheless
one
of
those
gifts
of
hers
it
would
perhaps
not
be
ungraceful
to
mention
to
you
for
it
was
one
with
which
i
was
myself
especially
delighted
for
she
gave
me
the
best
books
on
philosophy
and
history
and
many
of
the
orators
and
poets
since
i
had
brought
hardly
any
with
me
from
home
deluding
myself
with
the
hope
and
longing
to
return
home
again
and
gave
them
in
such
numbers
and
all
at
once
that
even
my
desire
for
them
was
satisfied
though
i
am
altogether
insatiable
of
converse
with
literature
and
so
far
as
books
went
she
made
galatia
and
the
country
of
the
celts
resemble
a
greek
temple
of
the
muses
and
to
these
gifts
i
applied
myself
incessantly
whenever
i
had
leisure
so
that
i
can
never
be
unmindful
of
the
gracious
giver
yes
even
when
i
take
the
field
one
thing
above
all
else
goes
with
me
as
a
necessary
provision
for
the
campaign
some
one
narrative
of
a
campaign
composed
long
ago
by
an
witness
for
many
of
those
records
of
the
experience
of
men
of
old
written
as
they
are
with
the
greatest
skill
furnish
to
those
who
by
reason
of
their
youth
have
missed
seeing
such
a
spectacle
a
clear
and
brilliant
picture
of
those
ancient
exploits
and
by
this
means
many
a
tiro
has
acquired
a
more
mature
understanding
and
judgment
than
belongs
to
very
many
older
men
and
that
advantage
which
people
think
old
age
alone
can
give
to
mankind
i
mean
experience
for
experience
it
is
that
enables
an
old
man
to
talk
more
wisely
than
the
young
even
this
the
study
of
history
can
give
to
the
young
if
only
they
are
diligent
moreover
in
my
opinion
there
is
in
such
books
a
means
of
liberal
education
for
the
character
supposing
that
one
understands
how
like
a
craftsman
setting
before
himself
as
patterns
the
noblest
men
and
words
and
deeds
to
mould
his
own
character
to
match
them
and
make
his
words
resemble
theirs
and
if
he
should
not
wholly
fall
short
of
them
but
should
achieve
even
some
slight
resemblance
believe
me
that
would
be
for
him
the
greatest
good
fortune
and
it
is
with
this
idea
constantly
before
me
that
not
only
do
i
give
myself
a
literary
education
by
means
of
books
but
even
on
my
campaigns
i
never
fail
to
carry
them
like
necessary
provisions
the
number
that
i
take
with
me
is
limited
only
by
particular
circumstances

but
perhaps
i
ought
not
now
to
be
writing
a
panegyric
on
books
nor
to
describe
all
the
benefits
that
we
might
derive
from
them
but
since
i
recognise
how
much
that
gift
was
worth
i
ought
to
pay
back
to
the
gracious
giver
thanks
not
perhaps
altogether
different
in
kind
from
what
she
gave
for
it
is
only
just
that
one
who
has
accepted
clever
discourses
of
all
sorts
laid
up
as
treasure
in
books
should
sound
a
strain
of
eulogy
if
only
in
slight
and
unskilful
phrases
composed
in
an
unlearned
and
rustic
fashion
for
you
would
not
say
that
a
farmer
showed
proper
feeling
who
when
starting
to
plant
his
vineyard
begs
for
cuttings
from
his
neighbours
and
presently
when
he
cultivates
his
vines
asks
for
a
mattock
and
then
for
a
hoe
and
finally
for
a
stake
to
which
the
vine
must
be
tied
and
which
it
must
lean
against
so
that
it
may
itself
be
supported
and
the
bunches
of
grapes
as
they
hang
may
nowhere
touch
the
soil
and
then
after
obtaining
all
he
asked
for
drinks
his
fill
of
the
pleasant
gift
of
dionysus
but
does
not
share
either
the
grapes
or
the
must
with
those
whom
he
found
so
willing
to
help
him
in
his
husbandry
just
so
one
would
not
say
that
a
shepherd
or
neatherd
or
even
a
goatherd
was
honest
and
good
and
who
in
winter
when
his
flocks
need
shelter
and
fodder
met
with
the
utmost
consideration
from
his
friends
who
helped
him
to
procure
many
things
and
gave
him
food
in
abundance
and
lodging
and
presently
when
spring
and
summer
appeared
forgot
in
lordly
fashion
all
those
kindnesses
and
shared
neither
his
milk
nor
cheeses
nor
anything
else
with
those
who
had
saved
his
beasts
for
him
when
they
would
otherwise
have
perished

and
now
take
the
case
of
one
who
cultivates
literature
of
any
sort
and
is
himself
young
and
therefore
needs
numerous
guides
and
the
abundant
food
and
pure
nourishment
that
is
to
be
obtained
from
ancient
writings
and
then
suppose
that
he
should
be
deprived
of
all
these
all
at
once
is
it
think
you
slight
assistance
that
he
is
asking
and
is
it
slight
payment
that
he
deserves
who
comes
to
his
aid
but
perhaps
he
ought
not
even
to
attempt
to
make
him
any
return
for
his
zeal
and
kind
actions
perhaps
he
ought
to
imitate
the
famous
thales
that
consummate
philosopher
and
that
answer
which
we
have
all
heard
and
which
is
so
much
admired
for
when
someone
asked
what
fee
he
ought
to
pay
him
for
knowledge
he
had
acquired
thales
replied
if
you
let
it
be
known
that
it
was
i
who
taught
you
you
will
amply
repay
just
so
one
who
has
not
himself
been
the
teacher
but
has
helped
another
in
any
way
to
gain
knowledge
would
indeed
be
wronged
if
he
did
not
obtain
gratitude
and
that
acknowledgement
of
the
gift
which
even
the
philosopher
seems
to
have
demanded
well
and
good
but
this
gift
of
hers
was
both
welcome
and
magnificent
and
as
for
gold
and
silver
i
neither
asked
for
them
nor
were
they
in
question
should
i
be
willing
thus
to
wear
out
your
patience

but
i
wish
to
tell
you
a
story
very
well
worth
your
hearing
unless
indeed
you
are
already
wearied
by
the
length
of
this
garrulous
speech
indeed
it
may
be
that
you
have
listened
without
enjoyment
to
what
has
been
said
so
far
seeing
that
the
speaker
is
a
layman
and
entirely
ignorant
of
rhetoric
and
knows
neither
how
to
invent
nor
how
to
use
the
writer
s
craft
but
speaks
the
truth
as
it
occurs
to
him
and
my
story
is
about
something
almost
of
the
present
time
now
many
will
say
i
suppose
persuaded
by
the
accomplished
sophists
that
i
have
collected
what
is
trivial
and
worthless
and
relate
it
to
you
as
though
it
were
of
serious
import
and
probably
they
will
say
this
not
because
they
are
jealous
of
my
speeches
or
because
they
wish
to
rob
me
of
the
reputation
that
they
may
bring
for
they
well
know
that
i
do
not
desire
to
be
their
rival
in
the
art
by
setting
my
own
speeches
against
theirs
nor
in
any
other
way
do
i
wish
to
quarrel
with
them
but
since
for
some
reason
or
other
they
are
ambitious
of
speaking
on
lofty
themes
at
any
cost
they
will
not
tolerate
those
who
have
not
their
ambition
and
they
reproach
them
with
weakening
the
power
of
rhetoric
for
they
say
that
only
those
deeds
are
to
be
admired
and
are
worthy
of
serious
treatment
and
repeated
praise
which
because
of
their
magnitude
have
been
thought
by
some
to
be
incredible
those
stories
for
instance
about
that
famous
woman
of
assyria
who
turned
aside
as
though
it
were
an
insignificant
brook
the
river
that
flows
through
babylon
and
built
a
gorgeous
palace
underground
and
then
turned
the
stream
back
again
beyond
the
dykes
that
she
had
made
for
of
her
many
a
tale
is
told
how
she
fought
a
naval
battle
with
three
thousand
ships
and
on
land
she
led
into
the
field
of
battle
three
million
hoplites
and
in
babylon
she
built
a
wall
very
nearly
five
hundred
stades
in
length
and
the
moat
that
surrounds
the
city
and
other
very
costly
and
expensive
edifices
were
they
tell
us
her
work
and
nitocris
who
came
later
than
she
and
rhodogyne
and
tomyris
aye
and
a
crowd
of
women
beyond
number
who
played
men
s
parts
in
no
very
seemly
fashion
occur
to
my
mind
and
some
of
them
were
conspicuous
for
their
beauty
and
so
became
notorious
though
it
brought
them
no
happiness
but
since
they
were
the
causes
of
dissension
and
long
wars
among
countless
nations
and
as
many
men
as
could
reasonably
be
collected
from
a
country
of
that
size
they
are
celebrated
by
the
orators
as
having
given
rise
to
mighty
deeds
and
a
speaker
who
has
nothing
of
this
sort
to
relate
seems
ridiculous
because
he
makes
no
great
effort
to
astonish
his
hearers
or
to
introduce
the
marvellous
into
his
speeches
now
shall
we
put
this
question
to
these
orators
whether
any
one
of
them
would
wish
to
have
a
wife
or
daughter
of
that
sort
rather
than
like
penelope
and
yet
in
her
case
homer
had
no
more
to
tell
than
of
her
discretion
and
her
love
for
her
husband
and
the
good
care
she
took
of
her
and
her
son
evidently
she
did
not
concern
herself
with
the
fields
or
the
flocks
and
as
for
leading
an
army
or
speaking
in
public
of
course
she
never
even
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
but
even
when
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
speak

suitors

it
was
in
mild
accents
that
she
expressed
herself
and
it
was
not
because
he
was
short
of
such
great
deeds
or
of
women
famous
for
them
that
he
sang
the
praises
of
penelope
rather
than
the
others
for
instance
he
could
have
made
it
his
ambition
to
tell
the
story
of
the
amazon
s
campaign
and
have
filled
all
his
poetry
with
tales
of
that
sort
which
certainly
have
a
wonderful
power
to
delight
and
charm
for
as
to
the
taking
of
the
wall
and
the
siege
and
that
battle
near
the
ships
which
in
some
respects
seems
to
have
resembled
a
and
then
the
fight
of
the
hero
and
the
river
he
did
not
bring
them
into
this
poem
with
the
desire
to
relate
something
new
and
strange
of
his
own
invention
and
even
though
this
fight
was
as
they
say
most
marvellous
he
neglected
and
passed
over
the
marvellous
as
we
see
what
reason
then
can
anyone
give
for
his
praising
penelope
so
enthusiastically
and
making
not
the
slightest
allusion
to
those
famous
women
because
by
reason
of
her
virtue
and
discretion
many
blessings
have
been
gained
for
mankind
both
for
individuals
and
for
the
common
weal
whereas
from
the
ambition
of
those
others
there
has
arisen
no
benefit
whatever
but
incurable
calamities
and
so
as
he
was
i
think
a
wise
and
inspired
poet
he
decided
that
to
praise
penelope
was
better
and
more
just
and
since
i
adopt
so
great
a
guide
is
it
fitting
that
i
should
be
afraid
lest
some
person
think
me
trivial

but
it
is
indeed
a
noble
witness
that
i
shall
now
bring
forward
that
splendid
orator
pericles
the
renowned
the
olympian
it
is
said
that
once
a
crowd
of
flatterers
surrounded
him
and
were
distributing
his
praises
among
them
one
telling
how
he
had
reduced
samos
another
how
he
had
recovered
euboea
some
how
he
had
sailed
round
the
peloponnesus
while
others
spoke
of
his
enactments
or
of
his
rivalry
with
cimon
who
was
reputed
to
be
a
most
excellent
citizen
and
a
distinguished
general
but
pericles
gave
no
sign
either
of
annoyance
or
exultation
and
there
was
but
one
thing
in
all
his
political
career
for
which
he
claimed
to
deserve
praise
that
though
he
had
governed
the
athenian
people
for
so
long
he
had
been
responsible
for
no
man
s
death
and
no
citizen
when
he
put
on
black
clothes
had
ever
said
that
pericles
was
the
cause
of
his
misfortune
now
by
zeus
the
god
of
friendship
do
you
think
i
need
any
further
witness
to
testify
that
the
greatest
proof
of
virtue
and
one
better
worth
praise
than
all
the
rest
put
together
is
not
to
have
caused
the
death
of
any
citizen
or
to
have
taken
his
money
from
him
or
involved
him
in
unjust
exile
but
he
who
like
a
good
physician
tries
to
ward
off
such
calamities
as
these
and
by
no
means
thinks
that
it
is
enough
for
him
not
to
cause
anyone
to
contract
a
disease
but
unless
he
cures
and
cares
for
everyone
as
far
as
he
can
considers
that
his
work
is
unworthy
of
his
skill
do
you
think
that
in
justice
such
a
one
ought
to
receive
no
higher
praise
than
pericles
and
shall
we
not
hold
in
higher
honour
her
character
and
that
authority
which
enables
her
to
do
what
she
will
since
what
she
wills
is
the
good
of
all
for
this
i
make
the
sum
and
substance
of
my
whole
encomium
though
i
do
not
lack
other
narratives
such
as
are
commonly
held
to
be
marvellous
and
splendid

if
anyone
should
suspect

my

rest
is
vain
affectation

empty
and
insolent
pretension
this
at
least
he
will
not
suspect
that
the
visit
which
she
lately
made
to
rome
when
the
emperor
was
on
his
campaign
and
had
crossed
the
rhine
by
bridges
of
boats
near
the
frontiers
of
galatia
is
a
false
and
vain
invention
i
could
indeed
very
properly
have
given
an
account
of
this
visit
and
described
how
the
people
and
the
senate
welcomed
her
with
rejoicings
and
went
to
meet
her
with
enthusiasm
and
received
her
as
is
their
custom
to
receive
an
empress
and
told
the
amount
of
the
expenditure
how
generous
and
splendid
it
was
and
the
costliness
of
the
preparations
and
reckoned
up
the
sums
she
distributed
to
the
presidents
of
the
tribes
and
the
centurions
of
the
people

nothing
of
that
sort
has
ever
seemed

me

do

wish
to
praise
wealth
before
virtue

yet
i
am
aware
that
the
generous
spending
of
money
implies
a
sort
of
virtue
nevertheless
i
rate
more
highly
goodness
and
temperance
and
wisdom
and
all
those
other
qualities
of
hers
that
i
have
described
bringing

myself
as

that

a
hymn
that
describes
the
physical
qualities
of
a
god
julian
was
an
uncritical
disciple
of
the
later
school
and
apparently
reproduces
without
any
important
modification
the
doctrines
of
its
chief
representative
the
syrian
iamblichus
with
whom
begins
the
decadence
of
as
a
philosophy
oriental
superstition
took
the
place
of
the
severe
spiritualism
of
plotinus
and
his
followers
and
a
philosophy
that
had
been
from
the
first
markedly
religious
is
now
expounded
by
theurgists
and
the
devotees
of
strange
oriental
cults
it
is
mithras
the
persian
god
rather
than
apollo
whom
julian
identifies
with
his
intellectual
god
helios
and
apollo
plays
a
minor
part
among
his
manifestations
mithras
worship
which
tertullian
called
a
satanic
plagiarism
of
christianity
because
in
certain
of
its
rites
it
recalled
the
sacraments
of
the
christian
church
first
made
its
appearance
among
the
romans
in
the
first
century
less
hospitably
received
at
first
than
the
cults
of
isis
and
serapis
and
the
great
mother
of
pessinus
it
gradually
overpowered
them
and
finally
dominated
the
whole
roman
empire
though
it
was
never
welcomed
by
the
hellenes
for
the
romans
it
supplied
the
ideals
of
purity
devotion
and
which
the
other
cults
had
lacked
the
worshippers
of
mithras
were
taught
to
contend
against
the
powers
of
evil
submitted
themselves
to
a
severe
moral
discipline
and
their
reward
after
death
was
to
become
as
pure
as
the
gods
to
whom
they
ascend
if
christianity
says
renan
had
been
checked
in
its
growth
by
some
deadly
disease
the
world
would
have
become
julian
like
the
emperor
commodus
in
the
second
century
had
no
doubt
been
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
mithras
and
the
severe
discipline
of
the
cult
was
profoundly
attractive
to
one
who
had
been
estranged
by
early
associations
from
the
very
similar
teaching
of
the
christians
julian
followed
plotinus
and
iamblichus
in
making
the
supreme
principle
the
one
ἓν
or
the
good
τὸ
ἀγαθὸν
which
presides
over
the
intelligible
world
νοητὸς
κόσμος
where
rule
plato
s
ideas
now
called
the
intelligible
gods
νοητοὶ
θεοί
iamblichus
had
imported
into
the
platonic
system
the
intermediary
world
of
intellectual
gods
νοεροὶ
θεοί
on
them
their
supreme
god
and
centre
bestows
the
intelligence
and
creative
and
unifying
forces
that
he
has
received
from
his
transcendental
counterpart
among
the
intelligible
gods
the
third
member
of
the
triad
is
the
world
of
governed
by
the
sun
the
visible
counterpart
of
helios
what
distinguishes
julian
s
triad
from
other
triads
is
this
hierarchy
of
three
suns
in
the
three
worlds
and
further
the
importance
that
he
gives
to
the
intermediary
world
the
abode
of
he
pays
little
attention
to
the
remote
intelligible
world
and
devotes
his
exposition
to
helios
the
intellectual
god
and
the
visible
sun
helios
is
the
link
that
relates
the
three
members
of
the
triad
his
middleness
μεσότης
is
not
only
local
he
is
in
every
possible
sense
the
mediator
and
unifier
μεσότης
is
the
aristotelian
word
for
the
mean
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
was
used
with
the
active
sense
of
mediation
before
julian
a
passage
in
plutarch
however
seems
to
indicate
that
the
middleness
of
the
sun
was
a
persian
doctrine
the
principle
of
good
most
nearly
resembles
light
and
the
principle
of
evil
darkness
and
between
both
is
mithras
therefore
the
persians
called
mithras
the
mediator
μεσίτης
naville
has
pointed
out
the
resemblance
between
the
sun
as
mediator
and
the
christian
logos
which
julian
may
have
had
in
mind
julian
s
system
results
in
a
practically
monotheistic
worship
of
helios
and
here
he
probably
parts
company
with
iamblichus
but
though
deeply
influenced
by
mithraism
julian
was
attempting
to
revive
the
pagan
gods
and
if
he
could
not
in
the
fourth
century
restore
the
ancient
faith
in
the
gods
of
homer
he
nevertheless
could
not
omit
from
his
creed
the
numerous
deities
whose
temples
and
altars
he
had
rebuilt
here
he
took
advantage
of
the
identification
of
greek
roman
and
oriental
deities
which
had
been
going
on
for
centuries
the
old
names
endeared
by
the
associations
of
literature
could
be
retained
without
endangering
the
supremacy
of
helios
julian
identifies
zeus
helios
hades
oceanus
and
the
egyptian
serapis
but
the
omnipotent
zeus
of
greek
mythology
is
now
a
creative
force
which
works
with
helios
and
has
no
separate
existence
tradition
had
made
athene
the
child
of
zeus
but
julian
regards
her
as
the
manifestation
of
the
intelligent
forethought
of
helios
dionysus
is
the
vehicle
of
his
fairest
thoughts
and
aphrodite
a
principle
that
emanates
from
him
he
contrives
that
all
the
more
important
gods
of
greece
egypt
and
persia
shall
play
their
parts
as
manifestations
of
helios
the
lesser
gods
are
mediating
demons
as
well
as
forces
his
aim
was
to
provide
the
hellenic
counterpart
of
the
positive
revealed
religion
of
christianity
hence
his
insistence
on
the
inspiration
of
homer
hesiod
and
plato
and
his
statement
that
the
allegorical
interpretations
of
the
mysteries
are
not
mere
hypotheses
whereas
the
doctrines
of
the
astronomers
deserve
no
higher
title
the
oration
is
dedicated
to
his
friend
and
comrade
in
arms
sallust
who
is
probably
identical
with
the
philosopher
of
the
school
of
iamblichus
who
wrote
about
the
treatise
the
gods
and
the
cumont
calls
this
the
official
catechism
of
the
pagan
empire
and
wilamowitz
regards
it
as
the
positive
complement
of
julian
s
pamphlet
the
julian
s
eighth
oration
is
a
discourse
of
consolation

and
have
a
share
in
existence
and
a
reasoning
soul
and
intelligence
but
above
all
others
it
is
of
importance
to
myself
for
i
am
a
follower
of
king
helios
and
of
this
fact
i
possess
within
me
known
to
myself
alone
proofs
more
certain
that
i
can
give
but
this
at
least
i
am
permitted
to
say
without
sacrilege
that
from
my
childhood
an
extraordinary
longing
for
the
rays
of
the
god
penetrated
deep
into
my
soul
and
from
my
earliest
years
my
mind
was
so
completely
swayed
by
the
light
that
illumines
the
heavens
that
not
only
did
i
desire
to
gaze
intently
at
the
sun
but
whenever
i
walked
abroad
in
the
night
season
when
the
firmament
was
clear
and
cloudless
i
abandoned
all
else
without
exception
and
gave
myself
up
to
the
beauties
of
the
heavens
nor
did
i
understand
what
anyone
might
say
to
me
nor
heed
what
i
was
doing
myself
i
was
considered
to
be
curious
about
these
matters
and
to
pay
too
much
attention
to
them
and
people
went
so
far
as
to
regard
me
as
an
astrologer
when
my
beard
had
only
just
begun
to
grow
and
yet
i
call
heaven
to
witness
never
had
a
book
on
this
subject
come
into
my
hands
nor
did
i
as
yet
even
know
what
that
science
was
but
why
do
i
mention
this
when
i
have
more
important
things
to
tell
if
i
should
relate
how
in
those
days
i
thought
about
the
gods
however
let
that
darkness
be
buried
in
oblivion
but
let
what
i
have
said
bear
witness
to
this
fact
that
the
heavenly
light
shone
all
about
me
and
that
it
roused
and
urged
me
on
to
its
contemplation
so
that
even
then
i
recognised
of
myself
that
the
movement
of
the
moon
was
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
universe
though
as
yet
i
had
met
no
one
of
those
who
are
wise
in
these
matters
now
for
my
part
i
envy
the
good
fortune
of
any
man
to
whom
the
god
has
granted
to
inherit
a
body
built
of
the
seed
of
holy
and
inspired
ancestors
so
that
he
can
unlock
the
treasures
of
wisdom
nor
do
i
despise
that
lot
with
which
i
was
myself
endowed
by
the
god
helios
that
i
should
be
born
of
a
house
that
rules
and
governs
the
world
in
my
time
but
further
i
regard
this
god
if
we
may
believe
the
wise
as
the
common
father
of
all
mankind
for
it
is
said
with
truth
that
man
and
the
sun
together
beget
man
and
that
the
god
sows
this
earth
with
souls
which
proceed
not
from
himself
alone
but
from
the
other
gods
also
and
for
what
purpose
the
souls
reveal
by
the
kind
of
lives
that
they
select
now
far
the
best
thing
is
when
anyone
has
the
fortune
to
have
inherited
the
service
of
the
god
even
before
the
third
generation
from
a
long
and
unbroken
line
of
ancestors
yet
it
is
not
a
thing
to
be
disparaged
when
anyone
recognising
that
he
is
by
nature
intended
to
be
the
servant
of
helios
either
alone
of
all
men
or
in
company
with
but
few
devotes
himself
to
the
service
of
his
master

his

great
is
the
invisible
if
one
judge
by
his
visible
self
and
to
tell
it
is
perhaps
impossible
even
though
one
should
consent
to
fall
short
of
what
is
his
due
for
well
i
know
that
no
one
in
the
world
could
attain
to
a
description
that
would
be
worthy
of
him
and
not
to
fail
of
a
certain
measure
of
success
in
his
praises
is
the
greatest
height
to
which
human
beings
can
attain
in
the
power
of
utterance
but
as
for
me
may
hermes
the
god
of
eloquence
stand
by
my
side
to
aid
me
and
the
muses
also
and
apollo
the
leader
of
the
muses
since
he
too
has
oratory
for
his
province
and
may
they
grant
that
i
utter
only
what
the
gods
approve
that
men
should
say
and
believe
about
them
what
then
shall
be
the
manner
of
my
praise
or
is
it
not
evident
that
if
i
describe
his
substance
and
his
origin
and
his
powers
and
energies
both
visible
and
invisible
and
the
gift
of
blessings
which
he
bestows
throughout
all
the
worlds
i
shall
compose
an
encomium
not
wholly
displeasing
to
the
god
with
these

this
divine
and
wholly
beautiful
universe
from
the
highest
vault
of
heaven
to
the
lowest
limit
of
the
earth
is
held
together
by
the
continuous
providence
of
the
god
has
existed
from
eternity
ungenerated
is
imperishable
for
all
time
to
come
and
is
guarded
immediately
by
nothing
else
than
the
fifth
substance
whose
culmination
is
the
beams
of
the
sun
and
in
the
second
and
higher
degree
so
to
speak
by
the
intelligible
world
but
in
a
still
loftier
sense
it
is
guarded
by
the
king
of
the
whole
universe
who
is
the
centre
of
all
things
that
exist
he
therefore
whether
it
is
right
to
call
him
the
or
the
idea
of
being
and
by
being
i
mean
the
whole
intelligible
region
or
the
one
since
the
one
seems
somehow
to
be
prior
to
all
the
rest
or
to
use
plato
s
name
for
him
the
good
at
any
rate
this
uncompounded
cause
of
the
whole
reveals
to
all
existence
beauty
and
perfection
and
oneness
and
irresistible
power
and
in
virtue
of
the
primal
creative
substance
that
abides
in
it
produced
as
middle
among
the
middle
and
intellectual
creative
causes
helios
the
most
mighty
god
proceeding
from
itself
and
in
all
things
like
unto
itself
even
so
the
divine
plato
believed
when
he
writes
therefore
said
i
when
i
spoke
of
this
understand
that
i
meant
the
offspring
of
the
good
which
the
good
begat
in
his
own
likeness
and
that
what
the
good
is
in
relation
to
pure
reason
and
its
objects
in
the
intelligible
world
such
is
the
sun
in
the
visible
world
in
relation
to
sight
and
its
accordingly
his
light
has
the
same
relation
to
the
visible
world
as
truth
has
to
the
intelligible
world
and
he
himself
as
a
whole
since
he
is
the
son
of
what
is
first
and
greatest
namely
the
idea
of
the
good
and
subsists
from
eternity
in
the
region
of
its
abiding
substance
has
received
also
the
dominion
among
the
intellectual
gods
and
himself
dispenses
to
the
intellectual
gods
those
things
of
which
the
good
is
the
cause
for
the
intelligible
gods
now
the
good
is
i
suppose
the
cause
for
the
intelligible
gods
of
beauty
existence
perfection
and
oneness
connecting
these
and
illuminating
them
with
a
power
that
works
for
good
these
accordingly
helios
bestows
on
the
intellectual
gods
also
since
he
has
been
appointed
by
the
good
to
rule
and
govern
them
even
though
they
came
forth
and
came
into
being
together
with
him
and
this
was
i
suppose
in
order
that
the
cause
which
resembles
the
good
may
guide
the
intellectual
gods
to
blessings
for
them
all
and
may
regulate
all
things
according
to
pure
reason

but
this
visible
disc
also
third
in
rank
is
clearly
for
the
objects
of
the
cause
of
preservation
and
this
visible
helios
is
the
cause
for
the
visible
gods
of
just
as
many
blessings
as
we
said
mighty
helios
bestows
on
the
intellectual
gods
and
of
this
there
are
clear
proofs
for
one
who
studies
the
unseen
world
in
the
light
of
things
seen
for
in
the
first
place
is
not
light
itself
a
sort
of
incorporeal
and
divine
form
of
the
transparent
in
a
state
of
activity
and
as
for
the
transparent
itself
whatever
it
is
since
it
is
the
underlying
basis
so
to
speak
of
all
the
elements
and
is
a
form
peculiarly
belonging
to
them
it
is
not
like
the
corporeal
or
compounded
nor
does
it
admit
qualities
peculiar
to
corporeal
substance
you
will
not
therefore
say
that
heat
is
a
property
of
the
transparent
or
its
opposite
cold
nor
will
you
assign
to
it
hardness
or
softness
or
any
other
of
the
various
attributes
connected
with
touch
or
taste
or
smell
but
a
nature
of
this
sort
is
obvious
to
sight
alone
since
it
is
brought
into
activity
by
light
and
light
is
a
form
of
this
substance
so
to
speak
which
is
the
substratum
of
and
coextensive
with
the
heavenly
bodies
and
of
light
itself
incorporeal
the
culmination
and
flower
so
to
speak
is
the
sun
s
rays
now
the
doctrine
of
the
phoenicians
who
were
wise
and
learned
in
sacred
lore
declared
that
the
rays
of
light
everywhere
diffused
are
the
undefiled
incarnation
of
pure
mind
and
in
harmony
with
this
is
our
theory
seeing
that
light
itself
is
incorporeal
if
one
should
regard
its
fountainhead
not
as
corporeal
but
as
the
undefiled
activity
of
mind
pouring
light
into
its
own
abode
and
this
is
assigned
to
the
middle
of
the
whole
firmament
whence
it
sheds
its
rays
and
fills
the
heavenly
spheres
with
vigour
of
every
kind
and
illumines
all
things
with
light
divine
and
undefiled
now
the
activities
proceeding
from
it
and
exercised
among
the
gods
have
been
in
some
measure
at
least
described
by
me
a
little
earlier
and
will
shortly
be
further
spoken
of
but
all
that
we
see
merely
with
the
sight
at
first
is
a
name
only
deprived
of
activity
unless
we
add
thereto
the
guidance
and
aid
of
light
for
what
speaking
generally
could
be
seen
were
it
not
first
brought
into
touch
with
light
in
order
that
i
suppose
it
may
receive
a
form
as
matter
is
brought
under
the
hand
of
a
craftsman
and
indeed
molten
gold
in
the
rough
is
simply
gold
and
not
yet
a
statue
or
an
image
until
the
craftsman
give
it
its
proper
shape
so
too
all
the
objects
of
sight
unless
they
are
brought
under
the
eyes
of
the
beholder
together
with
light
are
altogether
deprived
of
visibility
accordingly
by
giving
the
power
of
sight
to
those
who
see
and
the
power
of
being
seen
to
the
objects
of
sight
it
brings
to
perfection
by
means
of
a
single
activity
two
faculties
namely
vision
and
visibility
and
in
forms
and
substance
are
expressed
its
perfecting
powers

however
this
is
perhaps
somewhat
subtle
but
as
for
that
guide
whom
we
all
follow
ignorant
and
unlearned
philosophers
and
rhetoricians
what
power
in
the
universe
has
this
god
when
he
rises
and
sets
night
and
day
he
creates
and
before
our
eyes
changes
and
sways
the
universe
but
to
which
of
the
other
heavenly
bodies
does
this
power
belong
how
then
can
we
now
fail
to
believe
in
view
of
this
in
respect
also
to
things
more
divine
that
the
invisible
and
divine
tribes
of
intellectual
gods
above
the
heavens
are
filled
with
power
that
works
for
good
by
him
even
by
him
to
whom
the
whole
band
of
the
heavenly
bodies
yields
place
and
whom
all
generated
things
follow
piloted
by
his
providence
for
that
the
planets
dance
about
him
as
their
king
in
certain
intervals
fixed
in
relation
to
him
and
revolve
in
a
circle
with
perfect
accord
making
certain
halts
and
pursuing
to
and
fro
their
orbit
as
those
who
are
learned
in
the
study
of
the
spheres
call
their
visible
motions
and
that
the
light
of
the
moon
waxes
and
wanes
varying
in
proportion
to
its
distance
from
the
sun
is
i
think
clear
to
all
then
is
it
not
natural
that
we
should
suppose
that
the
more
venerable
ordering
of
bodies
among
the
intellectual
gods
corresponds
to
this
arrangement

let
us
therefore
comprehend
out
of
all
his
functions
first
his
power
to
perfect
from
the
fact
that
he
makes
visible
the
objects
of
sight
in
the
universe
for
through
his
light
he
perfects
them
secondly
his
creative
and
generative
power
from
the
changes
wrought
by
him
in
the
universe
thirdly
his
power
to
link
together
all
things
into
one
whole
from
the
harmony
of
his
motions
towards
one
and
the
same
goal
fourthly
his
middle
station
we
can
comprehend
from
himself
who
is
midmost
and
fifthly
the
fact
that
he
is
established
as
king
among
the
intellectual
gods
from
his
middle
station
among
the
planets
now
if
we
see
that
these
powers
or
powers
of
similar
importance
belong
to
any
one
of
the
other
visible
deities
let
us
not
assign
to
helios
leadership
among
the
gods
but
if
he
has
nothing
in
common
with
those
other
gods
except
his
beneficent
energy
and
of
this
too
he
gives
them
all
a
share
then
let
us
call
to
witness
the
priests
of
cyprus
who
set
up
common
altars
to
helios
and
zeus
but
even
before
them
let
us
summon
as
witness
apollo
who
sits
in
council
with
our
god
for
this
god
declares
zeus
hades
helios
serapis
three
gods
in
one
godhead
let
us
then
assume
that
among
the
intellectual
gods
helios
and
zeus
have
a
joint
or
rather
a
single
sovereignty
hence
i
think
that
with
reason
plato
called
hades
a
wise
god
and
we
call
this
same
god
hades
serapis
also
namely
the
unseen
and
intellectual
to
whom
plato
says
the
souls
of
those
who
have
lived
most
righteously
and
justly
mount
upwards
for
let
no
one
conceive
of
him
as
the
god
whom
the
legends
teach
us
to
shudder
at
but
as
the
mild
and
placable
since
he
completely
frees
our
souls
from
generation
and
the
souls
that
he
has
thus
freed
he
does
not
nail
to
other
bodies
punishing
them
and
exacting
penalties
but
he
carries
aloft
and
lifts
up
our
souls
to
the
intelligible
world
and
that
this
doctrine
is
not
wholly
new
but
that
homer
and
hesiod
the
most
venerable
of
the
poets
held
it
before
us
whether
this
was
their
own
view
or
like
seers
they
were
divinely
inspired
with
a
sacred
frenzy
for
the
truth
is
evident
from
the
following
hesiod
in
tracing
his
genealogy
said
that
helios
is
the
son
of
hyperion
and
thea
intimating
thereby
that
he
is
the
true
son
of
him
who
is
above
all
things
for
who
else
could
hyperion
be
and
is
not
thea
herself
in
another
fashion
said
to
be
most
divine
of
beings
but
as
for
a
union
or
marriage
let
us
not
conceive
of
such
a
thing
since
that
is
the
incredible
and
paradoxical
trifling
of
the
poetic
muse
but
let
us
believe
that
his
father
and
sire
was
the
most
divine
and
supreme
being
and
who
else
could
have
this
nature
save
him
who
transcends
all
things
the
central
point
and
goal
of
all
things
that
exist
and
homer
calls
him
hyperion
after
his
father
and
shows
his
unconditioned
nature
superior
to
all
constraint
for
zeus
as
homer
says
since
he
is
lord
of
all
constrains
the
other
gods
and
when
in
the
course
of
the
myth
helios
says
that
on
account
of
the
impiety
of
the
comrades
of
odysseus
he
will
forsake
olympus
zeus
no
longer
says
αὐτῇ
κεν
γαίῃ
αὐτῇ
τε
θαλάσσῃ
then
with
very
earth
would
i
draw
you
up
and
the
sea
withal

nor
does
he
threaten
him
with
fetters
or
violence
but
he
says
that
he
will
inflict
punishment
on
the
guilty
and
bids
helios
go
on
shining
among
the
gods
does
he
not
thereby
declare
that
besides
being
unconditioned
helios
has
also
the
power
to
perfect
for
why
do
the
gods
need
him
unless
by
sending
his
light
himself
invisible
on
their
substance
and
existence
he
fulfils
for
them
the
blessings
of
which
i
spoke
for
when
homer
says
that

means
that
by
reason
of
a
heavy
mist
it
was
thought
to
be
night
before
the

time
and
this
mist
is
surely
the
goddess
herself
and
in

place
also
in
the
poem

the
region
of
the
earth
contains
being
in
a
state
of

then
who
endows
it
with
imperishability
is
it
not
he
who
keeps
it
all
together
by
means
of
definite
limits
for
that
the
nature
of
being
should
be
unlimited
was
not
possible
since
it
is
neither
uncreated
nor
subsistent
and
if
from
being
something
were
generated
absolutely
without
ceasing
and
nothing
were
resolved
back
into
it
the
substance
of
things
generated
would
fail
accordingly
this
god
moving
in
due
measure
raises
up
and
stimulates
this
substance
when
he
approaches
it
and
when
he
departs
to
a
distance
he
diminishes
and
destroys
it
or
rather
he
himself
continually
revivifies
it
by
giving
it
movement
and
flooding
it
with
life
and
his
departure
and
turning
in
the
other
direction
is
the
cause
of
decay
for
things
that
perish
ever
does
his
gift
of
blessings
descend
evenly
upon
the
earth
for
now
one
country
now
another
receives
them
to
the
end
that
becoming
may
not
cease
nor
the
god
ever
benefit
less
or
more
than
is
his
custom
this
changeful
world
for
sameness
as
of
being
so
also
of
activity
exists
among
the
gods
and
above
all
the
others
in
the
case
of
the
king
of
the
all
helios
and
he
also
makes
the
simplest
movement
of
all
the
heavenly
bodies
that
travel
in
a
direction
opposite
to
the
whole
in
fact
this
is
the
very
thing
that
the
celebrated
aristotle
makes
a
proof
of
his
superiority
compared
with
the
others
nevertheless
from
the
other
intellectual
gods
also
forces
clearly
discernible
descend
to
this
world
and
now
what
does
this
mean
are
we
not
excluding
the
others
when
we
assert
that
the
leadership
has
been
assigned
to
helios
nay
far
rather
do
i
think
it
right
from
the
visible
to
have
faith
about
the
invisible
for
even
as
this
god
is
seen
to
complete
and
to
adapt
to
himself
and
to
the
universe
the
powers
that
are
bestowed
on
the
earth
from
the
other
gods
for
all
things
after
the
same
fashion
we
must
believe
that
among
the
invisible
gods
also
there
is
intercourse
with
one
another
his
mode
of
intercourse
being
that
of
a
leader
while
the
modes
of
intercourse
of
the
others
are
at
the
same
time
in
harmony
with
his
for
since
we
said
that
the
god
is
established
midmost
among
the
midmost
intellectual
gods
may
king
helios
himself
grant
to
us
to
tell
what
is
the
nature
of
that
middleness
among
things
of
which
we
must
regard
him
as
the
middle

what
is
he
the
middle
i
assert
then
that
he
is
midway
between
the
visible
gods
who
surround
the
universe
and
the
immaterial
and
intelligible
gods
who
surround
the
the
intelligible
and
divine
substance
is
as
it
were
multiplied
without
external
influence
and
without
addition
for
that
the
intellectual
and
wholly
beautiful
substance
of
king
helios
is
middle
in
the
sense
of
being
unmixed
with
extremes
complete
in
itself
and
distinct
from
the
whole
number
of
the
gods
visible
and
invisible
both
those
perceptible
by
sense
and
those
which
are
intelligible
only
i
have
already
declared
and
also
in
what
sense
we
must
conceive
of
his
middleness
but
if
i
must
also
describe
these
things
one
by
one
in
order
that
we
may
discern
with
our
intelligence
how
his
intermediary
nature
in
its
various
forms
is
related
both
to
the
highest
and
the
lowest
even
though
it
is
not
easy
to
recount
it
all
yet

me
try
to
say
what

in

is
not
our
whole

also
one
complete
living
organism
wholly
throughout
the
whole
of
it
full
of
soul
and
intelligence
perfect
with
all
its
parts
perfect
midway
then
between
this
uniform
mean
that
one
kind
of
unity
holds
together
in
one
all
that
exists
in
the
intelligible
world
while
the
other
kind
of
unity
unites
in
the
visible
world
all
things
into
one
and
the
same
perfect
these
i
say
is
the
uniform
perfection
of
king
helios
established
among
the
intellectual
gods
there
is
however
next
in
order
a
sort
of
binding
force
in
the
intelligible
world
of
the
gods
which
orders
all
things
into
one
again
is
there
not
visible
in
the
heavens
also
travelling
in
its
orbit
the
nature
of
the
fifth
substance
which
links
and
compresses
together
all
the
parts
holding
together
things
that
by
nature
are
prone
to
scatter
and
to
fall
away
from
one
another
these
existences
therefore
which
are
two
causes
of
connection
one
in
the
intelligible
world
while
the
other
appears
in
the
world
of
king
helios
combines
into
one
imitating
the
synthetic
power
of
the
former
among
the
intellectual
gods
seeing
that
he
proceeds
from
it
and
subsisting
prior
to
the
latter
which
is
seen
in
the
visible
world
then
must
not
the
unconditioned
also
which
exists
primarily
in
the
intelligible
world
and
finally
among
the
visible
bodies
in
the
heavens
possess
midway
between
these
two
the
unconditioned
substance
of
king
helios
and
from
that
primary
creative
substance
do
not
the
rays
of
his
light
illumining
all
things
descend
to
the
visible
world
again
to
take
another
point
of
view
the
creator
of
the
whole
is
one
but
many
are
the
creative
gods
who
revolve
in
the
heavens
midmost
therefore
of
these
also
we
must
place
the
creative
activity
which
descends
into
the
world
from
helios
but
also
the
power
of
generating
life
is
abundant
and
overflowing
in
the
intelligible
world
and
our
world
also
appears
to
be
full
of
generative
life
it
is
therefore
evident
that
the
power
of
king
helios
also
is
midway
between
both
the
worlds
and
the
phenomena
of
our
world
also
bear
witness
to
this
for
some
forms
he
perfects
others
he
makes
or
adorns
or
wakes
to
life
and
there
is
no
single
thing
which
apart
from
the
creative
power
derived
from
helios
can
come
to
light
and
to
birth
and
further
besides
this
if
we
should
comprehend
the
pure
and
undefiled
and
immaterial
substance
among
the
intelligible
which
nothing
external
is
added
nor
has
any
alien
thing
a
place
therein
but
it
is
filled
with
its
own
unstained
if
we
should
comprehend
also
the
pure
and
unmixed
nature
of
unstained
and
divine
substance
whose
elements
are
wholly
unmixed
and
which
in
the
visible
universe
surrounds
the
substance
that
revolves
here
also
we
should
discover
the
radiant
and
stainless
substance
of
king
helios
midway
between
the
two
that
is
to
say
midway
between
the
immaterial
purity
that
exists
among
the
intelligible
gods
and
that
perfect
purity
unstained
and
free
from
birth
and
death
that
exists
in
the
world
which
we
can
perceive
and
the
greatest
proof
of
this
is
that
not
even
the
light
which
comes
down
nearest
to
the
earth
from
the
sun
is
mixed
with
anything
nor
does
it
admit
dirt
and
defilement
but
remains
wholly
pure
and
without
stain
and
free
from
external
influences
among
all
existing
things

we
must
go
on
to
consider
the
immaterial
and
intelligible
forms
and
also
those
visible
forms
which
are
united
with
matter
or
the
substratum
here
again
the
intellectual
will
be
found
to
be
midmost
among
the
forms
that
surround

helios
by
which
forms
in
their

the
material
forms
are
aided

they
never

they
not

consider

not
he
the
cause
of
the
separation
of
the
forms
and
of
the
combination
of
matter
in
that
he
not
only
permits
us
to
comprehend
his
very
self
but
also
to
behold
him
with
our
eyes
for
the
distribution
of
his
rays
over
the
whole
universe
and
the
unifying
power
of
his
light

him
to
be
the
master
workman
who
gives
an
individual
existence
to
everything
that
is
created

now
though
there
are
many
more
blessings
connected
with
the
substance
of

god
and
apparent
to
us
which
show
that

proceed

his

is
as
though
by
way
of
a

to
give

to

is
his
province

contains

but
since
i
have
already
described
many
of
them
i
must
set
a
seal
as
it
were
on
this
discourse
now
that
i
am
about
to
pass
to
other
subjects
that
demand
no
less
investigation
what
then
that
seal
is
and
what
is
the
knowledge
of
the
god
s
substance
that
embraces
all
these
questions
and
as
it
were
sums
them
up
under
one
head
may
he
himself
suggest
to
my
mind
since
i
desire
to
describe
in
a
brief
summary
both
the
cause
from
which
he
proceeded
and
his
own
nature
and
those
blessings
with
which
he
fills
the
visible
world
this
then
we
must
declare
that
king
helios
is
one
and
proceeds
from
one
god
even
from
the
intelligible
world
which
is
itself
one
and
that
he
is
midmost
of
the
intellectual
gods
stationed
in
their
midst
by
every
kind
of
mediateness
that
is
harmonious
and
friendly
and
that
joins
what
is
sundered
and
that
he
brings
together
into
one
the
last
and
the
first
having
in
his
own
person
the
means
of
completeness
of
connection
of
generative
life
and
of
uniform
being
and
that
for
the
world
which
we
can
perceive
he
initiates
blessings
of
all
sorts
not
only
by
means
of
the
light
with
which
he
illumines
it
adorning
it
and
giving
it
its
splendour
but
also
because
he
calls
into
existence
along
with
himself
the
substance
of
the
sun
s
angels
and
that
finally
in
himself
he
comprehends
the
ungenerated
cause
of
things
generated
and
further
and
prior
to
this
the
ageless
and
abiding
cause
of
the
life
of
the
imperishable
bodies

now
as
for
what
it
was
right
to
say
about
the
substance
of
this
god
though
the
greater
part
has
been
omitted
nevertheless
much
has
been
said
but
since
the
multitude
of
his
powers
and
the
beauty
of
his
activities
is
so
great
that
we
shall
now
exceed
the
limit
of
what
we
observed
about
his
substance
it
is
natural
that
when
divine
things
come
forth
into
the
region
of
the
visible
they
should
be
multiplied
in

of
the
superabundance
of

we
must
assume
that
what
has
just
been
said
about
his
substance
applies
equally
to
his
powers
for
it
can
not
be
that
a
god
s
substance
is
one
thing
and
his
power
another
and
his
activity
by
zeus
a
third
thing
besides
these
for
all
that
he
wills
he
is
and
can
do
and
puts
into
action
for
he
does
not
will
what
is
not
nor
does
he
lack
power
to
do
what
he
wills
nor
does
he
desire
to
put
into
action
what
he
can
not
in
the
case
of
a
human
being
however
this
is
otherwise
for
his
is
a
fold
contending
nature
of
soul
and
body
compounded
into
one
the
former
divine
the
latter
dark
and
clouded
naturally
therefore
there
is
a
battle
and
a
feud
between
them
and
aristotle
also
says
that
this
is
why
neither
the
pleasures
nor
the
pains
in
us
harmonise
with
one
another
for
he
says
that
what
is
pleasant
to
one
of
the
natures
within
us
is
painful
to
the
nature
which
is
its
opposite
but
among
the
gods
there
is
nothing
of
this
sort
for
from
their
very
nature
what
is
good
belongs
to
them
and
perpetually
not
intermittently
in
the
first
place
then
all
that
i
said
when
i
tried
to
show
forth
his
substance
i
must
be
considered
to
have
said
about
his
powers
and
activities
also
and
since
in
such
cases
the
argument
is
naturally
convertible
all
that
i
observe
next
in
order
concerning
his
powers
and
activities
must
be
considered
to
apply
not
to
his
activities
only
but
to
his
substance
also
for
verily
there
are
gods
related
to
helios
and
of
like
substance
who
sum
up
the
stainless
nature
of
this
god
and
though
in
the
visible
world
they
are
plural
in
him
they
are
one
and
now
listen
first
to
what
they
assert
who
look
at
the
heavens
not
like
horses
and
cattle
or
some
other
unreasoning
and
ignorant
animal
but
from
it
draw
their
conclusions
about
the
unseen
world
but
even
before
this
if
you
please
consider
his
powers
and
activities
and
out
of
a
countless
number
observe
but

first
then
of
his
powers
is
that
through
which
he
reveals
the
whole
intellectual
substance
throughout
as
one
since
he
brings
together
its
extremes
for
even
as
in
the
world
of
we
can
clearly
discern
air
and
water
set
between
fire
and
earth
as
the
link
that
binds
together
the
extremes
would
one
not
reasonably
suppose
that
in
the
case
of
the
cause
which
is
separate
from
elements
and
prior
to
though
it
is
the
principle
of
generation
is
not
itself
is
so
ordered
that
in
that
world
also
the
extreme
causes
which
are
wholly
separate
from
elements
are
bound
together
into
one
through
certain
modes
of
mediation
by
king
helios
and
are
united
about
him
as
their
centre
and
the
creative
power
of
zeus
also
coincides
with
him
by
reason
of
which
in
cyprus
as
i
said
earlier
shrines
are
founded
and
assigned
to
them
in
common
and
apollo
himself
also
we
called
to
witness
to
our
statements
since
it
is
certainly
likely
that
he
knows
better
than
we
about
his
own
nature
for
he
too
abides
with
helios
and
is
his
colleague
by
reason
of
the
singleness
of
his
thoughts
and
the
stability
of
his
substance
and
the
consistency
of
his
activity

but
apollo
too
in
no
case
appears
to
separate
the
dividing
creative
function
of
dionysus
from
helios
and
since
he
always
subordinates
it
to
helios
and
so
indicates
that
dionysus
is
his
partner
on
the
throne
apollo
is
the
interpreter
for
us
of
the
fairest
purposes
that
are
to
be
found
with
our
god
further
helios
since
he
comprehends
in
himself
all
the
principles
of
the
fairest
intellectual
synthesis
is
himself
apollo
the
leader
of
the
muses
and
since
he
fills
the
whole
of
our
life
with
fair
order
he
begat
asclepios
in
the
world
though
even
before
the
beginning
of
the

he
had
him
by

but
though
one
should
survey
many
other
powers
that
belong
to
this
god
never
could
one
investigate
them
all
it
is
enough
to
have
observed
the
following
that
there
is
an
equal
and
identical
dominion
of
helios
and
zeus
over
the
separate
creation
which
is
prior
to
substances
in
the
region
that
is
to
say
of
the
absolute
causes
which
separated
from
visible
creation
existed
prior
to
it
secondly
we
observed
the
singleness
of
his
thoughts
which
is
bound
up
with
the
imperishableness
and
abiding
sameness
that
he
shares
with
apollo
thirdly
the
dividing
part
of
his
creative
function
which
he
shares
with
dionysus
who
controls
divided
substance
fourthly
we
have
observed
the
power
of
the
leader
of
the
muses
revealed
in
fairest
symmetry
and
blending
of
the
intellectual
finally
we
comprehended
that
helios
with
asclepios
fulfils
the
fair
order
of
the
whole
of

so
much
then
in
respect
to
those
powers
of
his
that
existed
before
the
beginning
of
the
world
and
with
these
are
his
works
over
the
whole
visible
world
in
that
he
fills
it
with
good
gifts
for
since
he
is
the
genuine
son
of
the
good
and
from
it
has
received
his
blessed
lot
in
fulness
of
perfection
he
himself
distributes
that
blessedness
to
the
intellectual
gods
bestowing
on
them
a
beneficent
and
perfect
nature
this
then
is
one
of
his
works
and
a
second
work
of
the
god
is
his
most
perfect
distribution
of
intelligible
beauty
among
the
intellectual
and
immaterial
forms
for
when
the
generative
substance
which
is
visible
in
our
world
desires
to
beget
in
the
beautiful
and
to
bring
forth
offspring
it
is
further
necessary
that
it
should
be
guided
by
the
substance
that
in
the
region
of
intelligible
beauty
does
this
very
thing
eternally
and
always
and
not
intermittently
now
fruitful
now
barren
for
all
that
is
beautiful
in
our
world
only
at
times
is
beautiful
always
in
the
intelligible
world
we
must
therefore
assert
that
the
ungenerated
offspring
in
beauty
intelligible
and
eternal
guides
the
generative
cause
in
the
visible
world
which
offspring
this
god
called
into
existence
and
keeps
at
his
side
and
to
it
he
assigns
also
perfect
reason
for
just
as
through
his
light
he
gives
sight
to
our
eyes
so
also
among
the
intelligible
gods
through
his
intellectual
he
causes
to
shine
far

of

that
by
which
he

those

souls
which
remain
in
the

of

never

themselves

i

the

is

from
eternity
there
subsisted
surrounding
helios
the
visible
world
and
from
eternity
the
light
that
encompasses
the
world
has
its
fixed
station
not
shining
intermittently
nor
in
different
ways
at
different
times
but
always
in
the
same
manner
and
if
one
desired
to
comprehend
as
far
as
the
mind
may
this
eternal
nature
from
the
point
of
view
of
time
one
would
understand
most
easily
of
how
many
blessings
for
the
world
throughout
eternity
he
is
the
cause
even
helios
the
king
of
the
all
who
shines
without
cessation
now
i
am
aware
that
the
great
philosopher
plato
and
after
him
a
man
who
though
he
is
later
in
time
is
by
no
means
inferior
to
him
in
mean
iamblichus
of
chalcis
who
through
his
writings
initiated
me
not
only
into
other
philosophic
doctrines
but
these
am
aware
i
say
that
they
employed
as
a
hypothesis
the
conception
of
a
generated
world
and
assumed
for
it
so
to
speak
a
creation
in
time
in
order
that
the
magnitude
of
the
works
that
arise
from
helios
might
be
recognised
but
apart
from
the
fact
that
i
fall
short
altogether
of
their
ability
i
must
by
no
means
be
so
rash
especially
since
the
glorious
hero
iamblichus
thought
it
was
not
without
risk
to
assume
even
as
a
bare
hypothesis
a
temporal
limit
for
the
creation
of
the
world
nay
rather
the
god
came
forth
from
an
eternal
cause
or
rather
brought
forth
all
things
from
everlasting
engendering
by
his
divine
will
and
with
untold
speed
and
unsurpassed
power
from
the
invisible
all
things
now
visible
in
present
time
and
then
he
assigned
as
his
own
station
the
in
order
that
from
all
sides
he
may
bestow
equal
blessings
on
the
gods
who
came
forth
by
his
agency
and
in
company
with
him
and
that
he
may
guide
the
seven
spheres
in
the
heavens
and
the
eighth
sphere
also
yes
and
as
i
believe
the
ninth
creation
too
namely
our
world
which
revolves
for
ever
in
a
continuous
cycle
of
birth
and
death
for
it
is
evident
that
the
planets
as
they
dance
in
a
circle
about
him
preserve
as
the
measure
of
their
motion
a
harmony
between
this
god
and
their
own
movements
such
as
i
shall
now
describe
and
that
the
whole
heaven
also
which
adapts
itself
to
him
in
all
its
parts
is
full
of
gods
who
proceed
from
helios
for
this
god
is
lord
of
five
zones
in
the
heavens
and
when
he
traverses
three
of
these
he
begets
in
those
three
the
three
graces
and
the
remaining
zones
are
the
scales
of
mighty
necessity
to
the
greeks
what
i
say
is
perhaps
though
one
were
obliged
to
say
to
them
only
what
is
known
and
familiar
yet
not
even
is
this
altogether
strange
to
them
as
one
might
suppose
for
who
then
in
your
opinion
are
the
dioscuri
o
ye
most
wise
ye
who
accept
without
question
so
many
of
your
traditions
do
you
not
call
them
alternate
of
days
because
they
may
not
both
be
seen
on
the
same
day
it
is
obvious
that
by
this
you
mean
yesterday
and
but
what
does
this
mean
in
the
name
of
those
same
dioscuri
let
me
apply
it
to
some
natural
object
so
that
i
may
not
say
anything
empty
and
senseless
but
no
such
object
could
one
find
however
carefully
one
might
search
for
it
for
the
theory
that
some
have
supposed
to
be
held
by
the
theogonists
that
the
two
hemispheres
of
the
universe
are
meant
has
no
meaning
for
how
one
could
call
each
one
of
the
hemispheres
alternate
of
days
is
not
easy
to
imagine
since
the
increase
of
their
light
in
each
separate
day
is
imperceptible
but
now
let
us
consider
a
question
on
which
some
may
think
that
i
am
innovating
we
say
correctly
that
those
persons
for
whom
the
time
of
the
sun
s
course
above
the
earth
is
the
same
in
one
and
the
same
month
share
the
same
day
consider
therefore
whether
the
expression
alternate
of
days
can
not
be
applied
both
to
the
tropics
and
the
other
the
polar
circles
but
some
one
will
object
that
it
does
not
apply
equally
to
both
for
though
the
former
are
always
visible
and
both
of
them
are
visible
at
once
to
those
who
inhabit
that
part
of
the
earth
where
shadows
are
cast
in
an
opposite
direction
yet
in
the
case
of
the
latter
those
who
see
the
one
do
not
see
the
other

it
that
the
sun
travels
in

and
on

theory
he
will
not

midway
between
the
three
worlds
that
is
according
to
the
hypothesis
of

indeed

ought
to
use
the
word

not

the

the

make

observe

it
is

no

now
besides
those
whom
i
have
mentioned
there
is
in
the
heavens
a
great
multitude
of
gods
who
have
been
recognised
as
such
by
those
who
survey
the
heavens
not
casually
nor
like
cattle
for
as
he
divides
the
three
spheres
by
four
through
the
zodiac
which
is
associated
with
every
one
of
the
three
so
he
divides
the
zodiac
also
into
twelve
divine
powers
and
again
he
divides
every
one
of
these
twelve
by
three
so
as
to
make
gods
in
all
hence
as
i
believe
there
descends
from
above
from
the
heavens
to
us
a
gift
of
the
graces
i
mean
from
the
spheres
for
this
god
by
thus
dividing
them
by
four
sends
to
us
the
fourfold
glory
of
the
seasons
which
express
the
changes
of
time
and
indeed
on
our
earth
the
graces
imitate
a
circle
in
their
statues
and
it
is
dionysus
who
is
the
giver
of
the
graces
and
in
this
very
connection
he
is
said
to
reign
with
helios
why
should
i
go
on
to
speak
to
you
of
horus
and
of
the
other
names
of
gods
which
all
belong
to
helios
for
from
his
works
men
have
learned
to
know
this
god
who
makes
the
whole
heavens
perfect
through
the
gift
of
intellectual
blessings
and
gives
it
a
share
of
intelligible
beauty
and
taking
the
heavens
as
their
point
they
have
learned
to
know
him
both
as
a
whole
and
his
parts
also
from
his
abundant
bestowal
of
good
gifts
for
he
exercises
control
over
all
movement
even
to
the
lowest
plane
of
the
universe
and
everywhere
he
makes
all
things
perfect
nature
and
soul
and
everything
that
exists
and
marshalling
together
this
great
army
of
the
gods
into
a
single
commanding
unity
he
handed
it
over
to
athene
pronoia
who
as
the
legend
says
sprang
from
the
head
of
zeus
but
i
say
that
she
was
sent
forth
from
helios
whole
from
the
whole
of
him
being
contained
within
him
though
i
disagree
with
the
legend
only
so
far
as
i
assert
that
she
came
forth
not
from
his
highest
part
but
whole
from
the
whole
of
him
for
in
other
respects
since
i
believe
that
zeus
is
in
no
wise
different
from
helios
i
agree
with
that
ancient
tradition
and
in
using
this
very
phrase
athene
pronoia
i
am
not
innovating
if
i
rightly
understand
the
words
ἵκετο

that
is
to
say
who
is
identical
with
helios
and
just
as
king
apollo
through
the
singleness
of
his
thoughts
is
associated
with
helios
so
also
we
must
believe
that
athene
has
received
her
nature
from
helios
and
that
she
is
his
intelligence
in
perfect
form
and
so
she
binds
together
the
gods
who
are
assembled
about
helios
and
brings
them
without
confusion
into
unity
with
helios
the
king
of
the
all
and
she
distributes
and
is
the
channel
for
stainless
and
pure
life
throughout
the
seven
spheres
from
the
highest
vault
of
the
heavens
as
far
as
selene
the
moon
for
selene
is
the
last
of
the
heavenly
spheres
which
athene
fills
with
wisdom
and
by
her
aid
selene
beholds
the
intelligible
which
is
higher
than
the
heavens
and
adorns
with
its
forms
the
realm
of
matter
that
lies
below
her
and
thus
she
does
away
with
its
savagery
and
confusion
and
disorder
moreover
to
mankind
athene
gives
the
blessings
of
wisdom
and
intelligence
and
the
creative
arts
and
surely
she
dwells
in
the
capitols
of
cities
because
through
her
wisdom
she
has
established
the
community
of
the
state
i
have
still
to
say
a
few
words
about
aphrodite
who
as
the
wise
men
among
the
phoenicians
affirm
and
as
i
believe
assists
helios
in
his
creative
function
she
is
in
very
truth
a
synthesis
of
the
heavenly
gods
and
in
their
harmony
she
is
the
spirit
of
love
and
unity
for
she
is
very
near
to
helios
and
when
she
pursues
the
same
course
as
he
and
approaches
him
she
fills
the
skies
with
fair
weather
and
gives
generative
power
to
the
earth
for
she
herself
takes
thought
for
the
continuous
birth
of
living
things
and
though
of
that
continuous
birth
king
helios
is
the
primary
creative
cause
yet
aphrodite
is
the
joint
cause
with
him
she
who
enchants
our
souls
with
her
charm
and
sends
down
to
earth
from
the
upper
air
rays
of
light
most
sweet
and
stainless
aye
more
lustrous
than
gold
itself
i
desire
to
mete
out
to
you
still
more
of
the
theology
of
the
phoenicians
and
whether
it
be
to
some
purpose
my
argument
as
it
proceeds
will
show
the
inhabitants
of
emesa
a
place
from
time
immemorial
sacred
to
helios
associate
with
helios
in
their
temples
monimos
and
azizos
iamblichus
from
whom
i
have
taken
this
and
all
besides
a
little
from
a
great
store
says
that
the
secret
meaning
to
be
interpreted
is
that
monimos
is
hermes
and
azizos
ares
the
assessors
of
helios
who
are
the
channel
for
many
blessings
to
the
region
of
our
earth

the

also

said
then
that
helios
holds
sway
among
the
intellectual
gods
in
that
he
unites
into
one
about
his
own
undivided
substance
a
great
multitude
of
the
gods
and
further
i
demonstrated
that
among
the
gods
whom
we
can
perceive
who
revolve
eternally
in
their
most
blessed
path
he
is
leader
and
lord
since
he
bestows
on
their
nature
its
generative
power
and
fills
the
whole
heavens
not
only
with
visible
rays
of
light
but
with
countless
other
blessings
that
are
invisible
and
further
that
the
blessings
which
are
abundantly
supplied
by
the
other
visible
gods
are
made
perfect
by
him
and
that
even
prior
to
this
the
visible
gods
themselves
are
made
perfect
by
his
unspeakable
and
divine
activity
in
the
same
manner
we
must
believe
that
on
this
our
world
of
generation
certain
gods
have
alighted
who
are
linked
together
with
helios
and
these
gods
guide
the
nature
of
the
elements
and
inhabit
together
with
the
three
higher
races
those
souls
which
are
upborne
by
the
elements
but
for
the
divided
souls
also
of
how
many
blessings
is
he
the
cause
for
he
extends
to
them
the
faculty
of
judging
and
guides
them
with
justice
and
purifies
them
by
his
brilliant
light
again
does
he
not
set
in
motion
the
whole
of
nature
and
kindle
life
therein
by
bestowing
on
it
generative
power
from
on
high
but
for
the
divided
natures
also
is
not
he
the
cause
that
they
journey
to
their
appointed
end
for
aristotle
says
that
man
is
begotten
by
man
and
the
sun
together
accordingly
the
same
theory
about
king
helios
must
surely
apply
to
all
the
other
activities
of
the
divided
souls
again
does
he
not
produce
for
us
rain
and
wind
and
the
clouds
in
the
skies
by
employing
as
though
it
were
matter
the
two
kinds
of
vapour
for
when
he
heats
the
earth
he
draws
up
steam
and
smoke
and
from
these
there
arise
not
only
the
clouds
but
also
all
the
physical
changes
on
our
earth

great
and
small

but
why
do
i
deal
with
the
same
questions
at
such
length
when
i
am
free
at
last
to
come
to
my
goal
though
not
till
i
have
first
celebrated
all
the
blessings
that
helios
has
given
to
mankind
for
from
him
are
we
born
and
by
him
are
we
nourished
but
his
more
divine
gifts
and
all
that
he
bestows
on
our
souls
when
he
frees
them
from
the
body
and
then
lifts
them
up
on
high
to
the
region
of
those
substances
that
are
akin
to
the
god
and
the
fineness
and
vigour
of
his
divine
rays
which
are
assigned
as
a
sort
of
vehicle
for
the
safe
descent
of
our
souls
into
this
world
of
generation
all
this
i
say
let
others
celebrate
in
fitting
strains
but
let
me
believe
it
rather
than
demonstrate
its
truth
however
i
need
not
hesitate
to
discuss
so
much
as
is
known
to
all
plato
says
that
the
sky
is
our
instructor
in
wisdom
for
from
its
contemplation
we
have
learned
to
know
the
nature
of
number
whose
distinguishing
characteristics
we
know
only
from
the
course
of
the
sun
plato
himself
says
that
day
and
night
were
created
first
and
next
from
observing
the
moon
s
light
which
was
bestowed
on
the
goddess
by
helios
we
later
progressed
still
further
in
the
understanding
of
these
matters
in
every
case
conjecturing
the
harmony
of
all
things
with
this
god
for
plato
himself
says
somewhere
that
our
race
was
by
nature
doomed
to
toil
and
so
the
gods
pitied
us
and
gave
us
dionysus
and
the
muses
as
playfellows
and
we
recognised
that
helios
is
their
common
lord
since
he
is
celebrated
as
the
father
of
dionysus
and
the
leader
of
the
muses
and
has
not
apollo
who
is
his
colleague
in
empire
set
up
oracles
in
every
part
of
the
earth
and
given
to
men
inspired
wisdom
and
regulated
their
cities
by
means
of
religious
and
political
ordinances
and
he
has
civilised
the
greater
part
of
the
world
by
means
of
greek
colonies
and
so
made
it
easier
for
the
world
to
be
governed
by
the
romans
for
the
romans
themselves
not
only
belong
to
the
greek
race
but
also
the
sacred
ordinances
and
the
pious
belief
in
the
gods
which
they
have
established
and
maintain
are
from
beginning
to
end
greek
and
beside
this
they
have
established
a
constitution
not
inferior
to
that
of
any
one
of
the
best
governed
states
if
indeed
it
be
not
superior
to
all
others
that
have
ever
been
put
into
practice
for
which
reason
i
myself
recognise
that
our
city
is
greek
both
in
descent
and
as
to
its
constitution

shall
i
now
go
on
to
tell
you
how
helios
took
thought
for
the
health
and
safety
of
all
men
by
begetting
asclepios
to
be
the
saviour
of
the
whole
world
and
how
he
bestowed
on
us
every
kind
of
excellence
by
sending
down
to
us
aphrodite
together
with
athene
and
thus
laid
down
for
our
protection
what
is
almost
a
law
that
we
should
only
unite
to
beget
our
kind
surely
it
is
for
this
reason
that
in
agreement
with
the
course
of
the
sun
all
plants
and
all
the
tribes
of
living
things
are
aroused
to
bring
forth
their
kind
what
need
is
there
for
me
to
glorify
his
beams
and
his
light
for
surely
everyone
knows
how
terrible
is
night
without
a
moon
or
stars
so
that
from
this
he
can
calculate
how
great
a
boon
for
us
is
the
light
of
the
sun
and
this
very
light
he
supplies
at
night
without
ceasing
and
directly
from
the
moon
in
those
upper
spaces
where
it
is
needed
while
he
grants
us
through
the
night
a
truce
from
toil
but
there
would
be
no
limit
to
the
account
if
one
should
endeavour
to
describe
all
his
gifts
of
this
sort
for
there
is
no
single
blessing
in
our
lives
which
we
do
not
receive
as
a
gift
from
this
god
either
perfect
from
him
alone
or
through
the
other
gods
perfected
by
him

moreover
he
is
the
founder
of

city
for
not
only
does
zeus
who
is
glorified
as
the
father
of
all
things
inhabit
its
citadel
together
with
athene
and
aphrodite
but
apollo
also
dwells
on
the
palatine
hill
and
helios
himself
under
this
name
of
his
which
is
commonly
known
to
all
and
familiar
to
all
and
i
could
say
much
to
prove
that
we
the
sons
of
romulus
and
aeneas
are
in
every
way
and
in
all
respects
connected
with
him
but
i
will
mention
briefly
only
what
is
most
familiar
according
to
the
legend
aeneas
is
the
son
of
aphrodite
who
is
subordinate
to
helios
and
is
his
kinswoman
and
the
tradition
has
been
handed
down
that
the
founder
of
our
city
was
the
son
of
ares
and
the
paradoxical
element
in
the
tale
has
been
believed
because
of
the
portents
which
later
appeared
to
support
it
for
a
they
say
gave
him
suck
now
i
am
aware
that
ares
who
is
called
azizos
by
the
syrians
who
inhabit
emesa
precedes
helios
in
the
sacred
procession
but
i
mentioned
it
before
so
i
think
i
may
let
that
pass
but
why
is
the
wolf
sacred
only
to
ares
and
not
to
helios
yet
men
call
the
period
of
a
year
lycabas
which
is
derived
from
and
not
only
homer
and
the
famous
men
of
greece
call
it
by
this
name
but
also
the
god
himself
when
he
says
ὀρχηθμῷ
λυκάβαντα
δυωδεκάμηνα
κέλευθα
with
dancing
does
he
bring

now
do
you
wish
me
to
bring
forward
a
still
greater
proof
that
the
founder
of
our
city
was
sent
down
to
earth
not
by
ares
alone
though
perhaps
some
noble
daemon
with
the
character
of
ares
did
take
part
in
the
fashioning
of
his
mortal
body
even
he
who
is
said
to
have
visited
silvia
when
she
was
carrying
water
for
the
bath
of
the
goddess
but
the
whole
truth
is
that
the
soul
of
the
god
quirinus
came
down
to
earth
from
helios
for
we
must
i
think
believe
the
sacred
tradition
and
the
close
conjunction
of
helios
and
selene
who
share
the
empire
over
the
visible
world
even
as
it
had
caused
his
soul
to
descend
to
earth
in
like
manner
caused
to
mount
upwards
him
whom
it
received
back
from
the
earth
after
blotting
out
with
fire
from
a
thunderbolt
the
mortal
part
of
his
body
so
clearly
did
she
who
creates
earthly
matter
she
whose
place
is
at
the
furthest
point
below
the
sun
receive
quirinus
when
he
was
sent
down
to
earth
by
athene
goddess
of
forethought
and
when
he
took
flight
again
from
earth
she
led
him
back
straightway
to
helios

do
you
wish
me
to
mention
yet
another
proof
of
this
i
mean
the
work
of
king
numa
in
rome
maiden
priestesses
guard
the
undying
flame
of
the
sun
at
different
hours
in
turn
they
guard
the
fire
that
is
produced
on
earth
by
the
agency
of
the
god
and
i
can
tell
you
a
still
greater
proof
of
the
power
of
this
god
which
is
the
work
of
that
most
divine
king
himself
the
months
are
reckoned
from
the
moon
by
one
may
say
all
other
peoples
but
we
and
the
egyptians
alone
reckon
the
days
of
every
year
according
to
the
movements
of
the
sun
if
after
this
i
should
say
that
we
also
worship
mithras
and
celebrate
games
in
honour
of
helios
every
four
years
i
shall
be
speaking
of
customs
that
are
somewhat
recent
but
perhaps
it
is
better
to
cite
a
proof
from
the
remote
past
the
beginning
of
the
cycle
of
the
year
is
placed
at
different
times
by
different
peoples
some
place
it
at
the
spring
equinox
others
at
the
height
of
summer
and
many
in
the
late
autumn
but
they
each
and
all
sing
the
praises
of
the
most
visible
gifts
of
helios
one
nation
celebrates
the
season
best
adapted
for
work
in
the
fields
when
the
earth
bursts
into
bloom
and
exults
when
all
the
crops
are
just
beginning
to
sprout
and
the
sea
begins
to
be
safe
for
sailing
and
the
disagreeable
gloomy
winter
puts
on
a
more
cheerful
aspect
others
again
award
the
crown
to
the
summer
season
since
at
that
time
they
can
safely
feel
confidence
about
the
yield
of
the
fruits
when
the
grains
have
already
been
harvested
and
midsummer
is
now
at
its
height
and
the
fruits
on
the
trees
are
ripening
others
again
with
still
more
subtlety
regard
as
the
close
of
the
year
the
time
when
all
the
fruits
are
in
their
perfect
prime
and
decay
has
already
set
in
for
this
reason
they
celebrate
the
annual
festival
of
the
new
year
in
late
autumn
but
our
forefathers
from
the
time
of
the
most
divine
king
numa
paid
still
greater
reverence
to
the
god
helios
they
ignored
the
question
of
mere
utility
i
think
because
they
were
naturally
religious
and
endowed
with
unusual
intelligence
but
they
saw
that
he
is
the
cause
of
all
that
is
useful
and
so
they
ordered
the
observance
of
the
new
year
to
correspond
with
the
present
season
that
is
to
say
when
king
helios
returns
to
us
again
and
leaving
the
region
furthest
south
and
rounding
capricorn
as
though
it
were
a
advances
from
the
south
to
the
north
to
give
us
our
share
of
the
blessings
of
the
year
and
that
our
forefathers
because
they
comprehended
this
correctly
thus
established
the
beginning
of
the
year
one
may
perceive
from
the
following
for
it
was
not
i
think
the
time
when
the
god
turns
but
the
time
when
he
becomes
visible
to
all
men
as
he
travels
from
south
to
north
that
they
appointed
for
the
festival
for
still
unknown
to
them
was
the
nicety
of
those
laws
which
the
chaldæans
and
egyptians
discovered
and
which
hipparchus
and
ptolemy
perfected
but
they
judged
simply
by
and
were
limited
to
what
they
could
actually
see

but
the
truth
of
these
facts
was
recognised
as
i
said
by
a
later
generation
before
the
beginning
of
the
year
at
the
end
of
the
month
which
is
called
after
kronos
we
celebrate
in
honour
of
helios
the
most
splendid
games
and
we
dedicate
the
festival
to
the
invincible
sun
and
after
this
it
is
not
lawful
to
perform
any
of
the
shows
that
belong
to
the
last
month
gloomy
as
they
are
though
necessary
but
in
the
cycle
immediately
after
the
end
of
the
kronia
follow
the
heliaia
that
festival
may
the
ruling
gods
grant
me
to
praise
and
to
celebrate
with
sacrifice
and
above
all
the
others
may
helios
himself
the
king
of
the
all
grant
me
this
even
he
who
from
eternity
has
proceeded
from
the
generative
substance
of
the
good
even
he
who
is
midmost
of
the
midmost
intellectual
gods
who
fills
them
with
continuity
and
endless
beauty
and
superabundance
of
generative
power
and
perfect
reason
yea
with
all
blessings
at
once
and
independently
of
time
and
now
he
illumines
his
own
visible
abode
which
from
eternity
moves
as
the
centre
of
the
whole
heavens
and
bestows
a
share
of
intelligible
beauty
on
the
whole
visible
world
and
fills
the
whole
heavens
with
the
same
number
of
gods
as
he
contains
in
himself
in
intellectual
form
and
without
division
they
reveal
themselves
in
manifold
form
surrounding
him
but
they
are
attached
to
him
to
form
a
unity
aye
but
also
through
his
perpetual
generation
and
the
blessings
that
he
bestows
from
the
heavenly
bodies
he
holds
together
the
region
beneath
the
moon
for
he
cares
for
the
whole
human
race
in
common
but
especially
for
my
own
city
even
as
also
he
brought
into
being
my
soul
from
eternity
and
made
it
his
follower
all
this
therefore
that
i
prayed
for
a
moment
ago
may
he
grant
and
further
may
he
of
his
grace
endow
my
city
as
a
whole
with
eternal
existence
so
far
as
is
possible
and
protect
her
and
for
myself
personally
may
he
grant
that
so
long
as
i
am
permitted
to
live
i
may
prosper
in
my
affairs
both
human
and
divine
finally
may
he
grant
me
to
live
and
serve
the
state
with
my
life
so
long
as
is
pleasing
to
himself
and
well
for
me
and
expedient

this
discourse
friend
sallust
i
composed
in
three
nights
at
most
in
harmony
with
the
creative
power
of
the
god
as
far
as
possible
just
as
it
occurred
to
my
memory
and
i
have
ventured
to
write
it
down
and
to
dedicate
it
to
you
because
you
thought
my
earlier
work
on
the
kronia
was
not
wholly
worthless
but
if
you
wish
to
meet
with
a
more
complete
and
more
mystical
treatment
of
the
same
theme
then
read
the
writings
of
the
inspired
iamblichus
on
this
subject
and
you
will
find
there
the
most
consummate
wisdom
which
man
can
achieve
and
may
mighty
helios
grant
that
i
too
may
attain
to
no
less
perfect
knowledge
of
himself
and
that
i
may
instruct
all
men
speaking
generally
but
especially
those
who
are
worthy
to
learn
and
so
long
as
helios
grants
let
us
all
in
common
revere
iamblichus
the
beloved
of
the
gods
for
he
is
the
source
for
what
i
have
here
set
down
a
few
thoughts
from
many
as
they
occurred
to
my
mind
however
i
know
well
that
no
one
can
utter
anything
more
perfect
than
he
nay
not
though
he
should
labour
long
at
the
task
and
say
very
much
that
is
new
for
he
will
naturally
diverge
thereby
from
the
truest
knowledge
of
the
god
therefore
it
would
probably
have
been
a
vain
undertaking
to
compose
anything
after
iamblichus
on
the
same
subject
if
i
had
written
this
discourse
for
the
sake
of
giving
instruction
but
since
i
wished
to
compose
a
hymn
to
express
my
gratitude
to
the
god
i
thought
that
this
was
the
best
place
in
which
to
tell
to
the
best
of
my
power
of
his
essential
nature
and
so
i
think
that
not
in
vain
has
this
discourse
been
composed
for
the
saying
κὰδ
δύναμιν
ἕρδειν
ἀθανάτοισι
θεοῖσιν
to
the
extent
of
your
powers
offer
sacrifice
to
the
immortal
gods

i
apply
not
to
sacrifice
only
but
also
to
the
praises
that
we
offer
to
the
gods
for
the
third
time
therefore
i
pray
that
helios
the
king
of
the
all
may
be
gracious
to
me
in
recompense
for
this
my
zeal
and
may
he
grant
me

life

more
perfect
wisdom
and

intelligence
and
when
fate
wills
the
gentlest
exit
that
may
be
from
life
at
a
fitting
hour
and
that
i
may
ascend
to
him
thereafter

abide

him

oration
v
introduction
to
oration
v
the
cult
of
phrygian
cybele
the
mother
of
the
gods
known
to
the
latin
world
as
the
great
mother
magna
mater
was
the
first
oriental
religion
adopted
by
the
romans
in
the
fifth
oration
which
is
like
the
fourth
a
hymn
julian
describes
the
entrance
of
the
goddess
into
italy
in
the
third
century
in
greece
she
had
been
received
long
before
but
the
more
civilised
hellenes
had
not
welcomed
as
did
the
romans
the
more
barbarous
features
of
the
cult
the
mutilated
priests
the
galli
and
the
worship
of
attis
they
preferred
the
less
emotional
cult
of
the
syrian
adonis
in
athens
the
mother
of
the
gods
was
early
identified
with
gaia
the
earth
mother
and
the
two
became
inextricably
confused
but
julian
in
this
more
roman
than
greek
does
not
shrink
from
the
oriental
conception
of
cybele
as
the
lover
of
attis
attended
by
eunuch
priests
or
the
frenzy
of
renunciation
described
by
catullus
but
he
was
first
of
all
a
platonist
and
the
aim
of
this
hymn
as
of
the
fourth
oration
is
to
adapt
to
his
philosophy
a
popular
cult
and
to
give
its
mysteries
a
philosophic
interpretation
the
mithraic
religion
seeking
to
conciliate
the
other
cults
of
the
empire
had
from
the
first
associated
with
the
the
worship
of
the
magna
mater
and
attis
had
been
endowed
with
the
attributes
of
mithras
though
julian
s
hymn
is
in
honour
of
cybele
he
devotes
more
attention
to
attis
originally
the
myth
of
cybele
symbolises
the
succession
of
the
seasons
the
disappearance
of
attis
the
is
the
coming
of
winter
his
mutilation
is
the
barrenness
of
nature
when
the
sun
has
departed
his
restoration
to
cybele
is
the
renewal
of
spring
in
all
this
he
is
the
counterpart
of
persephone
among
the
greeks
and
of
adonis
in
syria
julian
interprets
the
myth
in
connection
with
the
three
worlds
described
in
the
fourth
oration
cybele
is

julian
follows
plotinus
in
regarding
the
myths
as
allegories
to
be
interpreted
by
the
philosopher
and
the
theosophist
they
are
riddles
to
be
solved
and
the
paradoxical
element
in
them
is
designed
to
turn
our
minds
to
the
hidden
truth
for
laymen
the
myth
is
enough
like
all
the
platonists
he
sometimes
uses
phrases
which
imply
human
weakness
or
chronological
development
for
his
divinities
and
then
withdraws
those
phrases
explaining
that
they
must
be
taken
in
another
sense
his
attitude
to
myths
is
further
defined
in
the
sixth

seventh
orations
the
fifth
oration

hardly
be

present

and

of
and

what
ought
not
to

shall
i
utter
the
unutterable
who
is
attis
or
gallus
who
is
the
mother
of
the
gods
and
what
is
the
manner
of
their
ritual
of
purification
and
further
why
was
it
introduced
in
the
beginning
among
us
romans
it
was
handed
down
by
the
phrygians
in
very
ancient
times
and
was
first
taken
over
by
the
greeks
and
not
by
any
ordinary
greeks
but
by
athenians
who
had
learned
by
experience
that
they
did
wrong
to
jeer
at
one
who
was
celebrating
the
mysteries
of
the
mother
for
it
is
said
that
they
wantonly
insulted
and
drove
out
gallus
on
the
ground
that
he
was
introducing
a
new
cult
because
they
did
not
understand
what
sort
of
goddess
they
had
to
do
with
and
that
she
was
that
very
deo
whom
they
worship
and
rhea
and
demeter
too
then
followed
the
wrath
of
the
goddess
and
the
propitiation
of
her
wrath
for
the
priestess
of
the
pythian
god
who
guided
the
greeks
in
all
noble
conduct
bade
them
propitiate
the
wrath
of
the
mother
of
the
gods
and
so
we
are
told
the
metroum
was
built
where
the
athenians
used
to
keep
all
their
state
records
after
the
greeks
the
romans
took
over
the
cult
when
the
pythian
god
had
advised
them
in
their
turn
to
bring
the
goddess
from
phrygia
as
an
ally
for
their
war
against
the
carthaginians
and
perhaps
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
insert
here
a
brief
account
of
what
happened
when
they
learned
the
response
of
the
oracle
the
inhabitants
of
rome
that
city
beloved
of
the
gods
sent
an
embassy
to
ask
from
the
kings
of
pergamon
who
then
ruled
over
phrygia
and
from
the
phrygians
themselves
the
most
holy
statue
of
the
goddess
and
when
they
had
received
it
they
brought
back
their
most
sacred
freight
putting
it
on
a
broad
which
could
sail
smoothly
over
those
wide
seas
thus
she
crossed
the
aegean
and
ionian
seas
and
sailed
round
sicily
and
over
the
etruscan
sea
and
so
entered
the
mouth
of
the
tiber
and
the
people
and
the
senate
with
them
poured
out
of
the
city
and
in
front
of
all
the
others
there
came
to
meet
her
all
the
priests
and
priestesses
in
suitable
attire
according
to
their
ancestral
custom
and
in
excited
suspense
they
gazed
at
the
ship
as
she
ran
before
a
fair
wind
and
about
her
keel
they
could
discern
the
foaming
wake
as
she
cleft
the
waves
and
they
greeted
the
ship
as
she
sailed
in
and
adored
her
from
afar
everyone
where
he
happened
to
be
standing
but
the
goddess
as
though
she
desired
to
show
the
roman
people
that
they
were
not
bringing
a
lifeless
image
from
phrygia
but
that
what
they
had
received
from
the
phrygians
and
were
now
bringing
home
possessed
greater
and
more
divine
powers
than
an
image
stayed
the
ship
directly
she
touched
the
tiber
and
she
was
suddenly
as
though
rooted
in
so
they
tried
to
tow
her
against
the
current
but
she
did
not
follow
then
they
tried
to
push
her
off
thinking
they
had
grounded
on
a
shoal
but
for
all
their
efforts
she
did
not
move
next
every
possible
device
was
brought
to
bear
but
in
spite
of
all
she
remained
immovable
thereupon
a
terrible
and
unjust
suspicion
fell
on
the
maiden
who
had
been
consecrated
to
the
most
sacred
office
of
priestess
and
they
began
to
accuse
claudia
that
was
the
name
of
that
noble
maiden
not
having
kept
herself
stainless
and
pure
for
the
goddess
wherefore
they
said
that
the
goddess
was
angry
and
was
plainly
declaring
her
wrath
for
by
this
time
the
thing
seemed
to
all
to
be
supernatural
now
at
first
she
was
filled
with
shame
at
the
mere
name
of
the
thing
and
the
suspicion
so
very
far
was
she
from
such
shameless
and
lawless
behaviour
but
when
she
saw
that
the
charge
against
her
was
gaining
strength
she
took
off
her
girdle
and
fastened
it
about
the
prow
of
the
ship
and
like
one
divinely
inspired
bade
all
stand
aside
and
then
she
besought
the
goddess
not
to
suffer
her
to
be
thus
implicated
in
unjust
slanders
next
as
the
story
goes
she
cried
aloud
as
though
it
were
some
nautical
word
of
command
o
goddess
mother
if
i
am
pure
follow
me
and
lo
she
not
only
made
the
ship
move
but
even
towed
her
for
some
distance
up
stream
two
things
i
think
the
goddess
showed
the
romans
on
that
day
first
that
the
freight
they
were
bringing
from
phrygia
had
no
small
value
but
was
priceless
and
that
this
was
no
work
of
men
s
hands
but
truly
divine
not
lifeless
clay
but
a
thing
possessed
of
life
and
divine
powers
this
i
say
was
one
thing
that
the
goddess
showed
them
and
the
other
was
that
no
one
of
the
citizens
could
be
good
or
bad
and
she
not
know
thereof
moreover
the
war
of
the
romans
against
the
carthaginians
forthwith
took
a
favourable
turn
so
that
the
third
war
was
waged
only
for
the
walls
of
carthage
itself

i
am
told
that
on
this
same
subject
of
which
i
am
impelled
to
speak
at
the
very
season
of
these
sacred
rites
porphyry
too
has
written
a
philosophic
treatise
but
since
i
have
never
met
with
it
i
do
not
know
whether
at
any
point
it
may
chance
to
agree
with
my
discourse
but
him
whom
i
call
gallus
or
attis
i
discern
of
my
own
knowledge
to
be
the
substance
of
generative
and
creative
mind
which
engenders
all
things
down
to
the
lowest
plane
of
matter
and
comprehends
in
itself
all
the
concepts
and
causes
of
the
forms
that
are
embodied
in
matter
for
truly
the
forms
of
all
things
are
not
in
all
things
and
in
the
highest
and
first
causes
we
do
not
find
the
forms
of
the
lowest
and
last
after
which
there
is
nothing
save
privation
coupled
with
a
dim
idea
now
there
are
many
substances
and
very
many
creative
gods
but
the
nature
of
the
third
creator
who
contains
in
himself
the
separate
concepts
of
the
forms
that
are
embodied
in
matter
and
also
the
connected
chain
of
causes
i
mean
that
nature
which
is
last
in
order
and
through
its
superabundance
of
generative
power
descends
even
unto
our
earth
through
the
upper
region
from
the
stars
is
he
whom
we
seek
even
attis
but
perhaps
i
ought
to
distinguish
more
clearly
what
i
mean
we
assert
that
matter
exists
and
also
form
embodied
in
matter
but
if
no
cause
be
assigned
prior
to
these
two
we
should
be
introducing
unconsciously
the
epicurean
doctrine
for
if
there
be
nothing
of
higher
order
than
these
two
principles
then
a
spontaneous
motion
and
chance
brought
them
together
but
says
some
acute
peripatetic
like
xenarchus
we
see
that
the
cause
of
these
is
the
fifth
or
cyclic
substance
aristotle
is
absurd
when
he
investigates
and
discusses
these
matters
and
theophrastus
likewise
at
any
rate
he
overlooked
the
implications
of
a
utterance
of
his
for
just
as
when
he
came
to
incorporeal
and
intelligible
substance
he
stopped
short
and
did
not
inquire
into
its
cause
and
merely
asserted
that
this
is
what
it
is
by
nature
surely
in
the
case
of
the
fifth
substance
also
he
ought
to
have
assumed
that
its
nature
is
to
be
thus
and
he
ought
not
to
have
gone
on
to
search
for
causes
but
should
have
stopped
at
these
and
not
fallen
back
on
the
intelligible
which
has
no
independent
existence
by
itself
and
in
any
case
represents
a
bare
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
xenarchus
says
as
i
remember
to
have
heard
now
whether
what
he
says
is
correct
or
not
let
us
leave
to
the
extreme
peripatetics
to
refine
upon
but
that
his
view
is
not
agreeable
to
me
is
i
think
clear
to
everyone
for
i
hold
that
the
theories
of
aristotle
himself
are
incomplete
unless
they
are
brought
into
harmony
with
those
of
plato
or
rather
we
must
make
these
also
agree
with
the
oracles
that
have
been
vouchsafed
to
us
by
the
gods

but
this
it
is
perhaps
worth
while
to
inquire
how
the
cyclic
substance
can
contain
the
incorporeal
causes
of
the
forms
that
are
embodied
in
matter
for
that
apart
from
these
causes
it
is
not
possible
for
generation
to
take
place
is
i
think
clear
and
manifest
for
why
are
there
so
many
kinds
of
generated
things
whence
arise
masculine
and
feminine
whence
the
distinguishing
characteristics
of
things
according
to
their
species
in
types
if
there
are
not
and
concepts
and
causes
which
existed
beforehand
to
serve
as
a
pattern
and
if
we
discern
these
causes
but
dimly
let
us
still
further
purify
the
eyes
of
the
soul
and
the
right
kind
of
purification
is
to
turn
our
gaze
inwards
and
to
observe
how
the
soul
and
embodied
mind
are
a
sort
of
mould
and
likeness
of
the
forms
that
are
embodied
in
matter
for
in
the
case
of
the
corporeal
or
of
things
that
though
incorporeal
come
into
being
and
are
to
be
studied
in
connection
with
the
corporeal
there
is
no
single
thing
whose
mental
image
the
mind
can
not
grasp
independently
of
the
corporeal
but
this
it
could
not
have
done
if
it
did
not
possess
something
naturally
akin
to
the
incorporeal
forms
indeed
it
is
for
this
reason
that
aristotle
himself
called
the
soul
the
place
of
the
forms
only
he
said
that
the
forms
are
there
not
actually
but
potentially
now
a
soul
of
this
sort
that
is
allied
with
matter
must
needs
possess
these
forms
potentially
only
but
a
soul
that
should
be
independent
and
unmixed
in
this
way
we
must
believe
would
contain
all
the
concepts
not
potentially
but
actually
let
us
make
this
clearer
by
means
of
the
example
which
plato
himself
employed
in
the
sophist
with
reference
certainly
to
another
theory
but
still
he
did
employ
it
and
i
bring
forward
the
illustration
not
to
prove
my
argument
for
one
must
not
try
to
grasp
it
by
demonstration
but
only
by
apprehension
for
it
deals
with
the
first
causes
or
at
least
those
that
rank
with
the
first
if
indeed
as
it
is
right
to
believe
we
must
regard
attis
also
as
a
god
what
then
and
of
what
sort
is
this
illustration
plato
says
that
if
any
man
whose
profession
is
imitation
desire
to
imitate
in
such
a
way
that
the
original
is
exactly
reproduced
this
method
of
imitation
is
troublesome
and
difficult
and
by
zeus
borders
on
the
impossible
but
pleasant
and
easy
and
quite
possible
is
the
method
which
only
seems
to
imitate
real
things
for
instance
when
we
take
up
a
mirror
and
turn
it
round
we
easily
get
an
impression
of
all
objects
and
show
the
general
outline
of
every
single
thing
from
this
example
let
us
go
back
to
the
analogy
i
spoke
of
and
let
the
mirror
stand
for
what
aristotle
calls
the
place
of
the
forms
potentially

now
the
forms
themselves
must
certainly
subsist
actually
before
they
subsist
potentially
if
therefore
the
soul
in
us
as
aristotle
himself
believed
contains
potentially
the
forms
of
existing
things
where
shall
we
place
the
forms
in
that
previous
state
of
actuality
shall
it
be
in
material
things
no
for
the
forms
that
are
in
them
are
evidently
the
last
and
lowest
therefore
it
only
remains
to
search
for
immaterial
causes
which
exist
in
actuality
prior
to
and
of
a
higher
order
than
the
causes
that
are
embodied
in
matter
and
our
souls
must
subsist
in
dependence
on
these
and
come
forth
together
with
them
and
so
receive
from
them
the
concepts
of
the
forms
as
mirrors
show
the
reflections
of
things
and
then
with
the
aid
of
nature
it
bestows
them
on
matter
and
on
these
material
bodies
of
our
world
for
we
know
that
nature
is
the
creator
of
bodies
universal
nature
in
some
sort
of
the
all
while
that
the
individual
nature
of
each
is
the
creator
of
particulars
is
plainly
evident
but
nature
exists
in
us
in
actuality
without
a
mental
image
whereas
the
soul
which
is
superior
to
nature
possesses
a
mental
image
besides
if
therefore
we
admit
that
nature
contains
in
herself
the
cause
of
things
of
which
she
has
however
no
mental
image
why
in
heaven
s
name
are
we
not
to
assign
to
the
soul
these
same
forms
only
in
a
still
higher
degree
and
with
priority
over
nature
seeing
that
it
is
in
the
soul
that
we
recognise
the
forms
by
means
of
mental
images
and
comprehend
them
by
means
of
the
concept
who
then
is
so
contentious
as
to
admit
on
the
one
hand
that
the
concepts
embodied
in
matter
exist
in
though
not
all
and
equally
in
actuality
yet
all
on
the
other
hand
he
refuses
to
recognise
that
the
same
is
true
of
the
soul
if
therefore
the
forms
exist
in
nature
potentially
but
not
actually
and
if
also
they
exist
potentially
in
the
soul
only
in
a
still
purer
sense
and
more
completely
separated
so
that
they
can
be
comprehended
and
recognised
but
yet
exist
in
actuality
nowhere
at
all
to
what
i
ask
shall
we
hang
the
chain
of
perpetual
generation
and
on
what
shall
we
base
our
theories
of
the
imperishability
of
the
universe
for
the
cyclic
substance
itself
is
composed
of
matter
and
form
it
must
therefore
follow
that
even
though
in
actuality
these
two
matter
and
form
are
never
separate
from
one
another
yet
for
our
intelligence
the
forms
must
have
prior
existence
and
be
regarded
as
of
a
higher
order
accordingly
since
for
the
forms
embodied
in
matter
a
wholly
immaterial
cause
has
been
assigned
which
leads
these
forms
under
the
hand
of
the
third
creator
for
us
is
the
lord
and
father
not
only
of
these
forms
but
also
of
the
visible
fifth
that
creator
we
distinguish
attis
the
cause
which
descends
even
unto
matter
and
we
believe
that
attis
or
gallus
is
a
god
of
generative
powers
of
him
the
myth
relates
that
after
being
exposed
at
birth
near
the
eddying
stream
of
the
river
gallus
he
grew
up
like
a
flower
and
when
he
had
grown
to
be
fair
and
tall
he
was
beloved
by
the
mother
of
the
gods
and
she
entrusted
all
things
to
him
and
moreover
set
on
his
head
the
starry
cap
but
if
our
visible
sky
covers
the
crown
of
attis
must
one
not
interpret
the
river
gallus
as
the
milky
way
for
it
is
there
they
say
that
the
substance
which
is
subject
to
change
mingles
with
the
passionless
revolving
sphere
of
the
fifth
substance
only
as
far
as
this
did
the
mother
of
the
gods
permit
this
fair
intellectual
god
attis
who
resembles
the
sun
s
rays
to
leap
and
dance
but
when
he
passed
beyond
this
limit
and
came
even
to
the
lowest
region
the
myth
said
that
he
had
descended
into
the
cave
and
had
wedded
the
nymph
and
the
nymph
is
to
be
interpreted
as
the
dampness
of
matter
though
the
myth
does
not
here
mean
matter
itself
but
the
lowest
immaterial
cause
which
subsists
prior
to
matter
indeed
heracleitus
also
says
ψυχῇσιν
θάνατος
ὑγρῇσι
it
is
death
to
souls
to
become

that

the

between

embodied
in

of

is

the

not
in
the
sense
that
one
sex
is
united
with
another

an
element
that
is

itself

who
then
is
the
mother
of
the
gods
she
is
the
source
of
the
intellectual
and
creative
gods
who
in
their
turn
guide
the
visible
gods
she
is
both
the
mother
and
the
spouse
of
mighty
zeus
she
came
into
being
next
to
and
together
with
the
great
creator
she
is
in
control
of
every
form
of
life
and
the
cause
of
all
generation
she
easily
brings
to
perfection
all
things
that
are
made
without
pain
she
brings
to
birth
and
with
the
father
s
aid
creates
all
things
that
are
she
is
the
motherless
maiden
enthroned
at
the
side
of
zeus
and
in
very
truth
is
the
mother
of
all
the
gods
for
having
received
into
herself
the
causes
of
all
the
gods
both
intelligible
and
she
became
the
source
of
the
intellectual
gods
now
this
goddess
who
is
also
forethought
was
inspired
with
a
passionless
love
for
attis
for
not
only
the
forms
embodied
in
matter
but
to
a
still
greater
degree
the
causes
of
those
forms
voluntarily
serve
her
and
obey
her
will
accordingly
the
myth
relates
the
following
that
she
who
is
the
providence
who
preserves
all
that
is
subject
to
generation
and
decay
loved
their
creative
and
generative
cause
and
commanded
that
cause
to
beget
offspring
rather
in
the
intelligible
region
and
she
desired
that
it
should
turn
towards
herself
and
dwell
with
her
but
condemned
it
to
dwell
with
no
other
thing
for
only
thus
would
that
creative
cause
strive
towards
the
uniformity
that
preserves
it
and
at
the
same
time
would
avoid
that
which
inclines
towards
matter
and
she
bade
that
cause
look
towards
her
who
is
the
source
of
the
creative
gods
and
not
be
dragged
down
or
allured
into
generation
for
in
this
way
was
mighty
attis
destined
to
be
an
even
mightier
creation
seeing
that
in
all
things
the
conversion
to
what
is
higher
produces
more
power
to
effect
than
the
inclination
to
what
is
lower
and
the
fifth
substance
itself
is
more
creative
and
more
divine
than
the
elements
of
our
earth
for
this
reason
that
it
is
more
nearly
connected
with
the
gods
not
that
anyone
surely
would
venture
to
assert
that
any
substance
even
if
it
be
composed
of
the
purest
aether
is
superior
to
soul
undefiled
and
pure
that
of
heracles
for
instance
as
it
was
when
the
creator
sent
it
to
earth
for
that
soul
of
his
both
seemed
to
be
and
was
more
effective
than
after
it
had
bestowed
itself
on
a
body
since
even
heracles
now
that
he
has
returned
one
and
indivisible
to
his
father
one
and
indivisible
more
easily
controls
his
own
province
than
formerly
when
he
wore
the
garment
of
flesh
and
walked
among
men
and
this
shows
that
in
all
things
the
conversion
to
the
higher
is
more
effective
than
the
propensity
to
the
lower
this
is
what
the
myth
aims
to
teach
us
when
it
says
that
the
mother
of
the
gods
exhorted
attis
not
to
leave
her
or
to
love
another
but
he
went
further
and
descended
even
to
the
lowest
limits
of
matter
since
however
it
was
necessary
that
his
limitless
course
should
cease
and
halt
at
last
mighty
helios
the
corybant
who
shares
the
mother
s
throne
and
with
her
creates
all
things
with
her
has
providence
for
all
things
and
apart
from
her
does
nothing
persuaded
the
lion
to
reveal
the
matter
and
who
is
the
lion
verily
we
are
told
that
he
is
coloured
he
is
therefore
the
cause
that
subsists
prior
to
the
hot
and
fiery
and
it
was
his
task
to
contend
against
the
nymph
and
to
be
jealous
of
her
union
with
attis
and
who
the
nymph
is
i
have
said
and
the
myth
says
that
the
lion
serves
the
creative
providence
of
the
world
which
evidently
means
the
mother
of
the
gods
then
it
says
that
by
detecting
and
revealing
the
truth
he
caused
the
youth
s
castration
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
castration
it
is
the
checking
of
the
unlimited
for
now
was
generation
confined
within
definite
forms
checked
by
creative
providence
and
this
would
not
have
happened
without
the
madness
of
attis
which
overstepped
and
transgressed
due
measure
and
thereby
made
him
become
weak
so
that
he
had
no
control
over
himself
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
this
should
come
to
pass
when
we
have
to
do
with
the
cause
that
ranks
lowest
among
the
gods
for
consider
the
fifth
substance
which
is
subject
to
no
change
of
any
sort
in
the
region
of
the
light
of
the
moon
i
mean
where
our
world
of
continuous
generation
and
decay
borders
on
the
fifth
substance
we
perceive
that
in
the
region
of
her
light
it
seems
to
undergo
certain
alterations
and
to
be
affected
by
external
influences
therefore
it
is
not
contradictory
to
suppose
that
our
attis
also
is
a
sort
of
that
is
actually
the
meaning
of
the
rather
for
the
universe
he
is
wholly
god
for
he
proceeds
from
the
third
creator
and
after
his
castration
is
led
upwards
again
to
the
mother
of
the
gods
but
though
he
seems
to
lean
and
incline
towards
matter
one
would
not
be
mistaken
in
supposing
that
though
he
is
the
lowest

nevertheless
he
is
the
leader
of

beings

him
a

indicate
the
difference
between
him
and
the
unchanging
gods
he
is
attended
by
the
corybants
who
are
assigned
to
him
by

they
are
the

leading
personalities
of
the
higher
races

are
next
in

attis

together
with

lion
who
is

have
chosen
for
themselves
hot
and
fiery
substance
and
so
are
first
and
foremost
the
cause
of
fire
and
through
the
heat
derived
from
fire
they
are
the
causes
of
motive
force
and
of
preservation
for
all
other
things
that
exist
and
attis
encircles
the
heavens
like
a
tiara
and
thence
sets
out
as
though
to
descend
to
earth

this
then
is
our
mighty
god
attis
this
explains
his
once
lamented
flight
and
concealment
and
disappearance
and
descent
into
the
cave
in
proof
of
this
let
me
cite
the
time
of
year
at
which
it
happens
for
we
are
told
that
the
sacred
tree
is
felled
on
the
day
when
the
sun
reaches
the
height
of
the
equinox
thereupon
the
trumpets
are
sounded
and
on
the
third
day
the
sacred
and
unspeakable
member
of
the
god
gallus
is
severed
next
comes
they
say
the
hilaria
and
the
festival
and
that
this
castration
so
much
discussed
by
the
crowd
is
really
the
halting
of
his
unlimited
course
is
evident
from
what
happens
directly
mighty
helios
touches
the
cycle
of
the
equinox
where
the
bounds
are
most
clearly
defined
for
the
even
is
bounded
but
the
uneven
is
without
bounds
and
there
is
no
way
through
or
out
of
it
at
that
time
then
precisely
according
to
the
account
we
have
the
sacred
tree
is
felled
thereupon
in
their
proper
order
all
the
other
ceremonies
take
place
some
of
them
are
celebrated
with
the
secret
ritual
of
the
mysteries
but
others
by
a
ritual
that
can
be
told
to
all
for
instance
the
cutting
of
the
tree
belongs
to
the
story
of
gallus
and
not
to
the
mysteries
at
all
but
it
has
been
taken
over
by
them
i
think
because
the
gods
wished
to
teach
us
in
symbolic
fashion
that
we
must
pluck
the
fairest
fruits
from
the
earth
namely
virtue
and
piety
and
offer
them
to
the
goddess
to
be
the
symbol
of
our
constitution
here
on
earth
for
the
tree
grows
from
the
soil
but
it
strives
upwards
as
though
to
reach
the
upper
air
and
it
is
fair
to
behold
and
gives
us
shade
in
the
heat
and
casts
before
us
and
bestows
on
us
its
fruits
as
a
boon
such
is
its
superabundance
of
generative
life
accordingly
the
ritual
enjoins
on
us
who
by
nature
belong
to
the
heavens
but
have
fallen
to
earth
to
reap
the
harvest
of
our
constitution
here
on
earth
namely
virtue
and
piety
and
then
strive
upwards
to
the
goddess
of
our
forefathers
to
her
who
is
the
principle
of
all
life

therefore
immediately
after
the
castration
the
trumpet
sounds
the
recall
for
attis
and
for
all
of
us
who
once
flew
down
from
heaven
and
fell
to
earth
and
after
this
signal
when
king
attis
stays
his
limitless
course
by
his
castration
the
god
bids
us
also
root
out
the
unlimited
in
ourselves
and
imitate
the
gods
our
leaders
and
hasten
back
to
the
defined
and
uniform
and
if
it
be
possible
to
the
one
itself
after
this
the
hilaria
must
by
all
means
follow
for
what
could
be
more
blessed
what
more
joyful
than
a
soul
which
has
escaped
from
limitlessness
and
generation
and
inward
storm
and
has
been
translated
up
to
the
very
gods
and
attis
himself
was
such
a
one
and
the
mother
of
the
gods
by
no
means
allowed
him
to
advance
unregarded
further
than
was
permitted
nay
she
made
him
turn
towards
herself
and
commanded
him
to
set
a
limit
to
his
limitless
course

but
let
no
one
suppose
my
meaning
to
be
that
this
was
ever
done
or
happened
in
a
way
that
implies
that
the
gods
themselves
are
ignorant
of
what
they
intend
to
do
or
that
they
have
to
correct
their
own
errors
but
our
ancestors
in
every
case
tried
to
trace
the
original
meanings
of
things
whether
with
the
guidance
of
the
gods
or
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
say
that
they
sought
for
them
under
the
leadership
of
the
when
they
had
discovered
those
meanings
they
clothed
them
in
paradoxical
myths
this
was
in
order
that
by
means
of
the
paradox
and
the
incongruity
the
fiction
might
be
detected
and
we
might
be
induced
to
search
out
the
truth
now
i
think
ordinary
men
derive
benefit
enough
from
the
irrational
myth
which
instructs
them
through
symbols
alone
but
those
who
are
more
highly
endowed
with
wisdom
will
find
the
truth
about
the
gods
helpful
though
only
on
condition
that
such
a
man
examine
and
discover
and
comprehend
it
under
the
leadership
of
the
gods
and
if
by
such
riddles
as
these
he
is
reminded
that
he
must
search
out
their
meaning
and
so
attains
to
the
goal
and
summit
of
his
quest
through
his
own
researches
he
must
not
be
modest
and
put
faith
in
the
opinions
of
others
rather
than
in
his
own
mental
powers

what
shall
i
say
now
by
way
of
summary
because
men
observed
that
as
far
as
the
fifth
substance
not
only
the
intelligible
world
but
also
the
visible
bodies
of
our
world
must
be
classed
as
unaffected
by
externals
and
divine
they
believed
that
as
far
as
the
fifth
substance
the
gods
are
uncompounded
and
when
by
means
of
that
generative
substance
the
visible
gods
came
into
being
and
from
everlasting
matter
was
produced
along
with
those
gods
from
them
and
through
their
agency
by
reason
of
the
superabundance
in
them
of
the
generative
and
creative
principle
then
the
providence
of
the
world
she
who
from
everlasting
is
of
the
same
essential
nature
as
the
gods
she
who
is
enthroned
by
the
side
of
king
zeus
and
moreover
is
the
source
of
the
intellectual
gods
set
in
order
and
corrected
and
changed
for
the
better
all
that
seemed
lifeless
and
barren
the
refuse
and
so
to
speak
offscourings
of
things
their
dregs
and
sediment
and
this
she
did
by
means
of
the
last
cause
derived
from
the
gods
in
which
the
substances
of
all
the
gods
come
to

for
the

the

we
see
them
applied
to

in

all
is
undefiled

pure
as

as

at

by

the

dwell

higher
powers
do
not
desire
to
drag
them
hence
down
to
our
world
rather
through
the
condescension
of
the
higher
they
desire
to
lead
the
things
of
our
earth
upwards
to
a
higher
plane
more
favoured
by
the
gods
and
in
fact
the
myth
does
not
say
that
the
mother
of
the
gods
was
hostile
to
attis
after
his
castration
but
it
says
that
though
she
is
no
longer
angry
she
was
angry
at
the
time
on
account
of
his
condescension
in
that
he
who
was
a
higher
being
and
a
god
had
given
himself
to
that
which
was
inferior
but
when
after
staying
his
limitless
progress
he
has
set
in
order
the
chaos
of
our
world
through
his
sympathy
with
the
cycle
of
the
equinox
where
mighty
helios
controls
the
most
perfect
symmetry
of
his
motion
within
due
limits
then
the
goddess
gladly
leads
him
upwards
to
herself
or
rather
keeps
him
by
her
side
and
never
did
this
happen
save
in
the
manner
that
it
happens
now
but
forever
is
attis
the
servant
and
charioteer
of
the
mother
forever
he
yearns
passionately
towards
generation
and
forever
he
cuts
short
his
unlimited
course
through
the
cause
whose
limits
are
fixed
even
the
cause
of
the
forms
in
like
manner
the
myth
says
that
he
is
led
upwards
as
though
from
our
earth
and
again
resumes
his
ancient
sceptre
and
dominion
not
that
he
ever
lost
it
or
ever
loses
it
now
but
the
myth
says
that
he
lost
it
on
account
of
his
union
with
that
which
is
subject
to
passion
and
change

but
perhaps
it
is
worth
while
to
raise
the
following
question
also
there
are
two
equinoxes
but
men
pay
more
honour
to
the
equinox
in
the
sign
of
capricorn
than
to
that
in
the
sign
of
cancer
surely
the
reason
for
this
is
evident
since
the
sun
begins
to
approach
us
immediately
after
the
spring
equinox
i
need
not
say
that
then
the
days
begin
to
lengthen
seemed
the
more
agreeable
season
for
apart
from
the
explanation
which
says
that
light
accompanies
the
gods
we
must
believe
that
the
uplifting
rays
of
the
sun
are
nearly
akin
to
those
who
yearn
to
be
set
free
from
generation
consider
it
clearly
the
sun
by
his
vivifying
and
marvellous
heat
draws
up
all
things
from
the
earth
and
calls
them
forth
and
makes
them
grow
and
he
separates
i
think
all
corporeal
things
to
the
utmost
degree
of
tenuity
and
makes
things
weigh
light
that
naturally
have
a
tendency
to
sink
we
ought
then
to
make
these
visible
things
proofs
of
his
unseen
powers
for
if
among
corporeal
things
he
can
bring
this
about
through
his
material
heat
how
should
he
not
draw
and
lead
upwards
the
souls
of
the
blessed
by
the
agency
of
the
invisible
wholly
immaterial
divine
and
pure
substance
which
resides
in
his
rays
we
have
seen
then
that
this
light
is
nearly
akin
to
the
god
and
to
those
who
yearn
to
mount
upwards
and
moreover
that
this
light
increases
in
our
world
so
that
when
helios
begins
to
enter
the
sign
of
capricorn
the
day
becomes
longer
than
the
night
it
has
also
been
demonstrated
that
the
god
s
rays
are
by
nature
uplifting
and
this
is
due
to
his
energy
both
visible
and
invisible
by
which
very
many
souls
have
been
lifted
up
out
of
the
region
of
the
senses
because
they
were
guided
by
that
sense
which
is
clearest
of
all
and
most
nearly
like
the
sun
for
when
with
our
eyes
we
perceive
the
sun
s
light
not
only
is
it
welcome
and
useful
for
our
lives
but
also
as
the
divine
plato
said
when
he
sang
its
praises
it
is
our
guide
to
wisdom
and
if
i
should
also
touch
on
the
secret
teaching
of
the
mysteries
in
which
the
chaldean
divinely
frenzied
celebrated
the
god
of
the
seven
rays
that
god
through
whom
he
lifts
up
the
souls
of
men
i
should
be
saying
what
is
unintelligible
yea
wholly
unintelligible
to
the
common
herd
but
familiar
to
the
happy
theurgists
and
so
i

the
present

i
was
saying
that
we
ought
not
to
suppose
that
the
ancients
appointed
the
season
of
the
rites
irrationally
but
rather
as
far
as
possible
with
plausible
and
true
grounds
of
reason
and
indeed
a
proof
of
this
is
that
the
goddess
herself
chose
as
her
province
the
cycle
of
the
equinox
for
the
most
holy
and
secret
mysteries
of
deo
and
the
maiden
are
celebrated
when
the
sun
is
in
the
sign
of
libra
and
this
is
quite
natural
for
when
the
gods
depart
we
must
consecrate
ourselves
afresh
so
that
we
may
suffer
no
harm
from
the
godless
power
of
darkness
that
now
begins
to
get
the
upper
hand
at
any
rate
the
athenians
celebrate
the
mysteries
of
deo
twice
in
the
year
and
the
lesser
mysteries
as
they
call
them
in
the
sign
of
capricorn
and
the
great
mysteries
when
the
sun
is
in
the
sign
of
cancer
and
this
for
the
reason
that
i
have
just
mentioned
and
i
think
that
these
mysteries
are
called
great
and
lesser
for
several
reasons
but
especially
as
is
natural
they
are
called
great
when
the
god
departs
rather
than
when
he
approaches
and
so
the
lesser
are
celebrated
only
by
way
of
reminder
i
mean
that
when
the
saving
and
uplifting
god
approaches
the
preliminary
rites
of
the
mysteries
take
place
then
a
little
later
follow
the
rites
of
purification
one
after
another
and
the
consecration
of
the
priests
then
when
the
god
departs
to
the
antipodes
the
most
important
ceremonies
of
the
mysteries
are
performed
for
our
protection
and
salvation
and
observe
the
following
as
in
the
festival
of
the
mother
the
instrument
of
generation
is
severed
so
too
with
the
athenians
those
who
take
part
in
the
secret
rites
are
wholly
chaste
and
their
leader
the
hierophant
forswears
generation
because
he
must
not
have
aught
to
do
with
the
progress
to
the
unlimited
but
only
with
the
substance
whose
bounds
are
fixed
so
that
it
abides
for
ever
and
is
contained
in
the
one
stainless
and
pure
on
this
subject

it
only
remains
now
to
speak
as
is
fitting
about
the
sacred
rite
itself
and
the
purification
so
that
from
these
also
i
may
borrow
whatever
contributes
to
my
argument
for
example
everyone
thinks
that
the
following
is
ridiculous
the
sacred
ordinance
allows
men
to
eat
meat
but
it
forbids
them
to
eat
grains
and
fruits
what
say
they
are
not
the
latter
lifeless
whereas
the
former
was
once
possessed
of
life
are
not
fruits
pure
whereas
meat
is
full
of
blood
and
of
much
else
that
offends
eye
and
ear
but
most
important
of
all
is
it
not
the
case
that
when
one
eats
fruit
nothing
is
hurt
while
the
eating
of
meat
involves
the
sacrifice
and
slaughter
of
animals
who
naturally
suffer
pain
and
torment
so
would
say
many
even
of
the
wisest
but
the
following
ordinance
is
ridiculed
by
the
most
impious
of
mankind
also
they
observe
that
whereas
vegetables
that
grows
upwards
can
be
eaten
roots
are
forbidden
turnips
for
instance
and
they
point
out
that
figs
are
allowed
but
not
pomegranates
or
apples
either
i
have
often
heard
many
men
saying
this
in
whispers
and
i
too
in
former
days
have
said
the
same
but
now
it
seems
that
i
alone
of
all
men
am
bound
to
be
deeply
grateful
to
the
ruling
gods
to
all
of
them
surely
but
above
all
the
rest
to
the
mother
of
the
gods
for
all
things
am
i
grateful
to
her
and
for
this
among
the
rest
that
she
did
not
disregard
me
when
i
wandered
as
it
were
in
darkness
for
first
she
bade
me
cut
off
no
part
indeed
of
my
body
but
by
the
aid
of
the
intelligible
cause
that
subsists
prior
to
our
souls
all
that
was
superfluous
and
vain
in
the
impulses
and
motions
of
my
own
soul
and
that
cause
gave
me
to
aid
my
understanding
certain
beliefs
which
are
perhaps
not
wholly
out
of
harmony
with
the
true
and
sacred
knowledge
of
the
gods
but
it
looks
as
though

for

is
better
to
bring
forward
certain
forms
so
to
speak
and
regulations
which
we
must
observe
in
order
to
be
able
to
decide
about
these
matters

my
haste

argument

first
i
had
better
remind
you
in
a
few
words
who
i
said
attis
is
and
what
his
castration
means
and
what
is
symbolised
by
the
ceremonies
that
occur
between
the
castration
and
the
hilaria
and
what
is
meant
by
the
rite
of
purification
attis
then
was
declared
to
be
an
original
cause
and
a
god
the
direct
creator
of
the
material
world
who
descends
to
the
lowest
limits
and
is
checked
by
the
creative
motion
of
the
sun
so
soon
as
that
god
reaches
the
exactly
limited
circuit
of
the
universe
which
is
called
the
equinox
because
of
its
effect
in
equalising
night
and
day
and
i
said
that
the
castration
meant
the
checking
of
limitlessness
which
could
only
be
brought
about
through
the
summons
and
resurrection
of
attis
to
the
more
venerable
and
commanding
causes
and
i
said
that
the
end
and
aim
of
the
rite
of
purification
is
the
ascent
of
our
souls

for
this
reason
then
the
ordinance
forbids
us
first
to
eat
those
fruits
that
grow
downwards
in
the
earth
for
the
earth
is
the
last
and
lowest
of
things
and
plato
also
says
that
evil
exiled
from
the
gods
now
moves
on
earth
and
in
the
oracles
the
gods
often
call
the
earth
refuse
and
exhort
us
to
escape
thence
and
so
in
the
first
place
the
generating
god
who
is
our
providence
does
not
allow
us
to
use
to
nourish
our
bodies
fruits
that
grow
under
the
earth
and
thereby
enjoins
that
we
turn
our
eyes
towards
the
heavens
or
rather
above
the
heavens
one
kind
of
fruit
of
the
earth
however
some
people
do
eat
i
mean
fruit
in
pods
because
they
regard
this
as
a
vegetable
rather
than
a
fruit
since
it
grows
with
a
sort
of
upward
tendency
and
is
upright
and
not
rooted
below
the
soil
i
mean
that
it
is
rooted
like
the
fruit
of
the
ivy
that
hangs
on
a
tree
or
of
the
vine
that
hangs
on
a
stem
for
this
reason
then
we
are
forbidden
to
eat
seeds
and
certain
plants
but
we
are
allowed
to
eat
fruit
and
vegetables
only
not
those
that
creep
on
the
ground
but
those
that
are
raised
up
from
the
earth
and
hang
high
in
the
air
it
is
surely
for
this
reason
that
the
ordinance
bids
us
also
avoid
that
part
of
the
turnip
which
inclines
to
the
earth
since
it
belongs
to
the
under
world
but
allows
us
to
eat
that
part
which
grows
upwards
and
attains
to
some
height
since
by
that
very
fact
it
is
pure
in
fact
it
allows
us
to
eat
any
vegetables
that
grow
upwards
but
forbids
us
roots
and
especially
those
which
are
nourished
in
and
influenced
by
the
earth
moreover
in
the
case
of
trees
it
does
not
allow
us
to
destroy
and
consume
apples
for
these
are
sacred
and
golden
and
are
the
symbols
of
secret
and
mystical
rewards
rather
are
they
worthy
to
be
reverenced
and
worshipped
for
the
sake
of
their
archetypes
and
pomegranates
are
forbidden
because
they
belong
to
the
and
the
fruit
of
the
perhaps
one
might
say
because
the
does
not
grow
in
phrygia
where
the
ordinance
was
first
established
but
my
own
theory
is
rather
that
it
is
because
this
tree
is
sacred
to
the
sun
and
is
perennial
that
we
are
forbidden
to
use
it
to
nourish
our
bodies
during
the
sacred
rites
besides
these
the
use
of
all
kinds
of
fish
is
forbidden
this
is
a
question
of
interest
to
the
egyptians
as
well
as
to
ourselves
now
my
opinion
is
that
for
two
reasons
we
ought
to
abstain
from
fish
at
all
times
if
possible
but
above
all
during
the
sacred
rites
one
reason
is
that
it
is
not
fitting
that
we
should
eat
what
we
do
not
use
in
sacrifices
to
the
gods
and
perhaps
i
need
not
be
afraid
that
hereupon
some
greedy
person
who
is
the
slave
of
his
belly
will
take
me
up
though
as
i
remember
that
very
thing
happened
to
me
once
before
and
then
i
heard
someone
objecting
what
do
you
mean
do
we
not
often
sacrifice
fish
to
the
gods
but
i
had
an
answer
ready
for
this
question
also
my
good
sir
i
said
it
is
true
that
we
make
offerings
of
fish
in
certain
mystical
sacrifices
just
as
the
romans
sacrifice
the
horse
and
many
other
animals
too
both
wild
and
domesticated
and
as
the
greeks
and
the
romans
too
sacrifice
dogs
to
hecate
and
among
other
nations
also
many
other
animals
are
offered
in
the
mystic
cults
and
sacrifices
of
that
sort
take
place
publicly
in
their
cities
once
or
twice
a
year
but
that
is
not
the
custom
in
the
sacrifices
which
we
honour
most
highly
in
which
alone
the
gods
deign
to
join
us
and
to
share
our
table
in
those
most
honoured
sacrifices
we
do
not
offer
fish
for
the
reason
that
we
do
not
tend
fish
nor
look
after
the
breeding
of
them
and
we
do
not
keep
flocks
of
fish
as
we
do
of
sheep
and
cattle
for
since
we
foster
these
animals
and
they
multiply
accordingly
it
is
only
right
that
they
should
serve
for
all
our
uses
and
above
all
for
the
sacrifices
that
we
honour
this
then
is
one
reason
why
i
think
we
ought
not
to
use
fish
for
food
at
the
time
of
the
rite
of
purification
the
second
reason
which
is
i
think
even
more
in
keeping
with
what
i
have
just
said
is
that
since
fish
also
in
a
manner
of
speaking
go
down
into
the
lowest
depths
they
even
more
than
seeds
belong
to
the
but
he
who
longs
to
take
flight
upwards
and
to
mount
aloft
above
this
atmosphere
of
ours
even
to
the
highest
peaks
of
the
heavens
would
do
well
to
abstain
from
all
such
food
he
will
rather
pursue
and
follow
after
things
that
tend
upwards
towards
the
air
and
strive
to
the
utmost
height
and
if
i
may
use
a
poetic
phrase
look
upward
to
the
skies
birds
for
example
we
may
eat
except
only
those
few
which
are
commonly
held
sacred
and
ordinary
animals
except
the
pig
this
animal
is
banned
as
food
during
the
sacred
rites
because
by
its
shape
and
way
of
life
and
the
very
nature
of
its
its
flesh
is
impure
and
belongs
wholly
to
the
earth
and
therefore
men
came
to
believe
that
it
was
an
acceptable
offering
to
the
gods
of
the
for
this
animal
does
not
look
up
at
the
sky
not
only
because
it
has
no
such
desire
but
because
it
is
so
made
that
it
can
never
look
upwards
these
then
are
the
reasons
that
have
been
given
by
the
divine
ordinance
for
abstinence
from
such
food
as
we
ought
to
renounce
and
we
who
comprehend
share
our
knowledge
with
those
who
know
the
nature
of
the
gods

and
to
the
question
what
food
is
permitted
i
will
only
say
this
the
divine
law
does
not
allow
all
kinds
of
food
to
all
men
but
takes
into
account
what
is
possible
to
human
nature
and
allows
us
to
eat
most
animals
as
i
have
said
it
is
not
as
though
we
must
all
of
necessity
eat
all
perhaps
that
would
not
be
we
are
to
use
first
what
our
physical
powers
allow
secondly
what
is
at
hand
in
abundance
thirdly
we
are
to
exercise
our
own
wills
but
at
the
season
of
the
sacred
ceremonies
we
ought
to
exert
those
wills
to
the
utmost
so
that
we
may
attain
to
what
is
beyond
our
ordinary
physical
powers
and
thus
may
be
eager
and
willing
to
obey
the
divine
ordinances
for
it
is
by
all
means
more
effective
for
the
salvation
of
the
soul
itself
that
one
should
pay
greater
heed
to
its
safety
than
to
the
safety
of
the
body
and
moreover
the
body
too
seems
thereby
to
share
insensibly
in
that
great
and
marvellous
benefit
for
when
the
soul
abandons
herself
wholly
to
the
gods
and
entrusts
her
own
concerns
absolutely
to
the
higher
powers
and
then
follow
the
sacred
too
being
preceded
by
the
divine
i
say
since
there
is
nothing
to
hinder
or
all
things
reside
in
the
gods
all
things
subsist
in
relation
to
them
all
things
are
filled
with
the
the
divine
light
illumines
our
souls
and
thus
endowed
with
divinity
they
impart
a
certain
vigour
and
energy
to
the
breath
implanted
in
them
by
nature
and
so
that
breath
is
hardened
as
it
were
and
strengthened
by
the
soul
and
hence
gives
health
to
the
whole
body
for
i
think
not
one
of
the
sons
of
asclepios
would
deny
that
all
diseases
or
at
any
rate
very
many
and
those
the
most
serious
are
caused
by
the
disturbance
and
derangement
of
the
breathing
some
doctors
assert
that
all
diseases
others
that
the
greater
number
and
the
most
serious
and
hardest
to
cure
are
due
to
this
moreover
the
oracles
of
the
gods
bear
witness
thereto
i
mean
that
by
the
rite
of
purification
not
the
soul
alone
but
the
body
as
well
is
greatly
benefited
and
preserved
indeed
the
gods
when
they
exhort
those
theurgists
who
are
especially
holy
announce
to
them
that
their
mortal
husk
of
raw
matter
shall
be
preserved

perishing

and
now
what
is
left
for
me
to
say
especially
since
it
was
granted
me
to
compose
this
hymn
at
a
breath
in
the
short
space
of
one
night
without
having
read
anything
on
the
subject
beforehand
or
thought
it
over
nay
i
had
not
even
planned
to
speak
thereof
until
the
moment
that
i
asked
for
these
may
the
goddess
bear
witness
to
the
truth
of
my
words
nevertheless
as
i
said
before
does
there
not
still
remain
for
me
to
celebrate
the
goddess
in
her
union
with
athene
and
dionysus
for
the
sacred
law
established
their
festivals
at
the
very
time
of
her
sacred
rites
and
i
recognise
the
kinship
of
athene
and
the
mother
of
the
gods
through
the
similarity
of
the
forethought
that
inheres
in
the
substance
of
both
goddesses
and
i
discern
also
the
divided
creative
function
of
dionysus
which
great
dionysus
received
from
the
single
and
abiding
principle
of
life
that
is
in
mighty
zeus
for
from
zeus
he
proceeded
and
he
bestows
that
life
on
all
things
visible
controlling
and
governing
the
creation
of
the
whole
divisible
world
together
with
these
gods
we
ought
to
celebrate
hermes
epaphroditus
for
so
this
god
is
entitled
by
the
initiated
who
say
that
he
kindles
the
torches
for
wise
attis
and
who
has
a
soul
so
dense
as
not
to
understand
that
through
hermes
and
aphrodite
are
invoked
all
generated
things
everywhere
since
they
everywhere
and
throughout
have
a
purpose
which
is
peculiarly
appropriate
to
the
logos
but
is
not
this
logos
attis
who
not
long
ago
was
out
of
his
senses
but
now
through
his
castration
is
called
wise
yes
he
was
out
of
his
senses
because
he
preferred
matter
and
presides
over
generation
but
he
is
wise
because
he
adorned
and
transformed
this
refuse
our
earth
with
such
beauty
as
no
human
art
or
cunning
could
imitate
but
how
shall
i
conclude
my
discourse
surely
with
this
hymn
to
the
great
goddess
