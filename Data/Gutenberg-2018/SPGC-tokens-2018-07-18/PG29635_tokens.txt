preface
if
a
preface
is
a
light
which
should
serve
to
illumine
the
contents
of
a
volume
i
choose
not
words
but
human
figures
to
illustrate
this
little
book
intended
to
enter
families
where
children
are
growing
up
i
therefore
recall
here
as
an
eloquent
symbol
helen
keller
and
anne
sullivan
macy
who
are
by
their
example
both
teachers
to
myself
and
before
the
world
living
documents
of
the
miracle
in
education
in
fact
helen
keller
is
a
marvelous
example
of
the
phenomenon
common
to
all
human
beings
the
possibility
of
the
liberation
of
the
imprisoned
spirit
of
man
by
the
education
of
the
senses
here
lies
the
basis
of
the
method
of
education
of
which
the
book
gives
a
succinct
idea
if
one
only
of
the
senses
sufficed
to
make
of
helen
keller
a
woman
of
exceptional
culture
and
a
writer
who
better
than
she
proves
the
potency
of
that
method
of
education
which
builds
on
the
senses
if
helen
keller
attained
through
exquisite
natural
gifts
to
an
elevated
conception
of
the
world
who
better
than
she
proves
that
in
the
inmost
self
of
man
lies
the
spirit
ready
to
reveal
itself
helen
clasp
to
your
heart
these
little
children
since
they
above
all
others
will
understand
you
they
are
your
younger
brothers
when
with
bandaged
eyes
and
in
silence
they
touch
with
their
little
hands
profound
impressions
rise
in
their
consciousness
and
they
exclaim
with
a
new
form
of
happiness
i
see
with
my
hands
they
alone
then
can
fully
understand
the
drama
of
the
mysterious
privilege
your
soul
has
known
when
in
darkness
and
in
silence
their
spirit
left
free
to
expand
their
intellectual
energy
redoubled
they
become
able
to
read
and
write
without
having
learnt
almost
as
it
were
by
intuition
they
only
they
can
understand
in
part
the
ecstasy
which
god
granted
you
on
the
luminous
path
of
learning

montessori
own
handbook
recent
years
have
seen
a
remarkable
improvement
in
the
conditions
of
child
life
in
all
civilized
countries
but
especially
in
england
statistics
show
a
decrease
in
infant
mortality
related
to
this
decrease
in
mortality
a
corresponding
improvement
is
to
be
seen
in
the
physical
development
of
children
they
are
physically
finer
and
more
vigorous
it
has
been
the
diffusion
the
popularization
of
science
which
has
brought
about
such
notable
advantages
mothers
have
learned
to
welcome
the
dictates
of
modern
hygiene
and
to
put
them
into
practice
in
bringing
up
their
children
many
new
social
institutions
have
sprung
up
and
have
been
perfected
with
the
object
of
assisting
children
and
protecting
them
during
the
period
of
physical
growth
in
this
way
what
is
practically
a
new
race
is
coming
into
being
a
race
more
highly
developed
finer
and
more
robust
a
race
which
will
be
capable
of
offering
resistance
to
insidious
disease
what
has
science
done
to
effect
this
science
has
suggested
for
us
certain
very
simple
rules
by
which
the
child
has
been
restored
as
nearly
as
possible
to
conditions
of
a
natural
life
and
an
order
and
a
guiding
law
have
been
given
to
the
functions
of
the
body
for
example
it
is
science
which
suggested
maternal
feeding
the
abolition
of
swaddling
clothes
baths
life
in
the
open
air
exercise
simple
short
clothing
quiet
and
plenty
of
sleep
rules
were
also
laid
down
for
the
measurement
of
food
adapting
it
rationally
to
the
physiological
needs
of
the
child
life
yet
with
all
this
science
made
no
contribution
that
was
entirely
new
mothers
had
always
nursed
their
children
children
had
always
been
clothed
they
had
breathed
and
eaten
before
the
point
is
that
the
same
physical
acts
which
performed
blindly
and
without
order
led
to
disease
and
death
when
ordered
were
the
means
of
giving
strength
and
life
the
great
progress
made
may
perhaps
deceive
us
into
thinking
that
everything
possible
has
been
done
for
children
we
have
only
to
weigh
the
matter
carefully
however
to
reflect
are
our
children
only
those
healthy
little
bodies
which
are
growing
and
developing
so
vigorously
under
our
eyes
is
their
destiny
fulfilled
in
the
production
of
beautiful
human
bodies
in
that
case
there
would
be
little
difference
between
their
lot
and
that
of
the
animals
which
we
raise
that
we
may
have
good
meat
or
beasts
of
burden
man
destiny
is
evidently
other
than
this
and
the
care
due
to
the
child
covers
a
field
wider
than
that
which
is
considered
by
physical
hygiene
the
mother
who
has
given
her
child
his
bath
and
sent
him
in
his
perambulator
to
the
park
has
not
fulfilled
the
mission
of
the
mother
of
humanity
the
hen
which
gathers
her
chickens
together
and
the
cat
which
licks
her
kittens
and
lavishes
on
them
such
tender
care
differ
in
no
wise
from
the
human
mother
in
the
services
they
render
no
the
human
mother
if
reduced
to
such
limits
devotes
herself
in
vain
feels
that
a
higher
aspiration
has
been
stifled
within
her
she
is
yet
the
mother
of
man
children
must
grow
not
only
in
the
body
but
in
the
spirit
and
the
mother
longs
to
follow
the
mysterious
spiritual
journey
of
the
beloved
one
who
will
be
the
intelligent
divine
creation
man
science
evidently
has
not
finished
its
progress
on
the
contrary
it
has
scarcely
taken
the
first
step
in
advance
for
it
has
hitherto
stopped
at
the
welfare
of
the
body
it
must
continue
however
to
advance
on
the
same
positive
lines
along
which
it
has
improved
the
health
and
saved
the
physical
life
of
the
children
it
is
bound
in
the
future
to
benefit
and
to
reenforce
their
inner
life
which
is
the
real
on
the
same
positive
lines
science
will
proceed
to
direct
the
development
of
the
intelligence
of
character
and
of
those
latent
creative
forces
which
lie
hidden
in
the
marvelous
embryo
of
man
spirit
as
the
child
body
must
draw
nourishment
and
oxygen
from
its
external
environment
in
order
to
accomplish
a
great
physiological
work
the
of
so
also
the
spirit
must
take
from
its
environment
the
nourishment
which
it
needs
to
develop
according
to
its
own
laws
of
growth
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
phenomena
of
development
are
a
great
work
in
themselves
the
consolidation
of
the
bones
the
growth
of
the
whole
body
the
completion
of
the
minute
construction
of
the
brain
the
formation
of
the
teeth
all
these
are
very
real
labors
of
the
physiological
organism
as
is
also
the
transformation
which
the
organism
undergoes
during
the
period
of
puberty
these
exertions
are
very
different
from
those
put
forth
by
mankind
in
that
is
to
say
in
social
production
whether
in
the
schools
where
man
is
taught
or
in
the
world
where
by
the
activity
of
his
intelligence
he
produces
wealth
and
transforms
his
environment
it
is
none
the
less
true
however
that
they
are
both
work
in
fact
the
organism
during
these
periods
of
greatest
physiological
work
is
least
capable
of
performing
external
tasks
and
sometimes
the
work
of
growth
is
of
such
extent
and
difficulty
that
the
individual
is
overburdened
as
with
an
excessive
strain
and
for
this
reason
alone
becomes
exhausted
or
even
dies
man
will
always
be
able
to
avoid
external
work
by
making
use
of
the
labor
of
others
but
there
is
no
possibility
of
shirking
that
inner
work
together
with
birth
and
death
it
has
been
imposed
by
nature
itself
and
each
man
must
accomplish
it
for
himself
this
difficult
inevitable
labor
this
is
the
work
of
the
child
when
we
say
then
that
little
children
should
we
are
referring
to
one
side
only
of
the
question
of
work
we
mean
that
they
should
rest
from
that
visible
work
to
which
the
little
child
through
his
weakness
and
incapacity
can
not
make
any
contribution
useful
either
to
himself
or
to
others
our
assertion
therefore
is
not
absolute
the
child
in
reality
is
not
resting
he
is
performing
the
mysterious
inner
work
of
his
autoformation
he
is
working
to
make
a
man
and
to
accomplish
this
it
is
not
enough
that
the
child
body
should
grow
in
actual
size
the
most
intimate
functions
of
the
motor
and
nervous
systems
must
also
be
established
and
the
intelligence
developed
the
functions
to
be
established
by
the
child
fall
into
two
groups
the
motor
functions
by
which
he
is
to
secure
his
balance
and
learn
to
walk
and
to
coordinate
his
movements
the
sensory
functions
through
which
receiving
sensations
from
his
environment
he
lays
the
foundations
of
his
intelligence
by
a
continual
exercise
of
observation
comparison
and
judgment
in
this
way
he
gradually
comes
to
be
acquainted
with
his
environment
and
to
develop
his
intelligence
at
the
same
time
he
is
learning
a
and
he
is
faced
not
only
with
the
motor
difficulties
of
articulation
sounds
and
words
but
also
with
the
difficulty
of
gaining
an
intelligent
understanding
of
names
and
of
the
syntactical
composition
of
the
language
if
we
think
of
an
emigrant
who
goes
to
a
new
country
ignorant
of
its
products
ignorant
of
its
natural
appearance
and
social
order
entirely
ignorant
of
its
language
we
realize
that
there
is
an
immense
work
of
adaptation
which
he
must
perform
before
he
can
associate
himself
with
the
active
life
of
the
unknown
people
no
one
will
be
able
to
do
for
him
that
work
of
adaptation
he
himself
must
observe
understand
remember
form
judgments
and
learn
the
new
language
by
laborious
exercise
and
long
experience
what
is
to
be
said
then
of
the
child
what
of
this
emigrant
who
comes
into
a
new
world
who
weak
as
he
is
and
before
his
organism
is
completely
developed
in
a
short
time
adapt
himself
to
a
world
so
complex
up
to
the
present
day
the
little
child
has
not
received
rational
aid
in
the
accomplishment
of
this
laborious
task
as
regards
the
psychical
development
of
the
child
we
find
ourselves
in
a
period
parallel
to
that
in
which
the
physical
life
was
left
to
the
mercy
of
chance
and
instinct
the
period
in
which
infant
mortality
was
a
scourge
it
is
by
scientific
and
rational
means
also
that
we
must
facilitate
that
inner
work
of
psychical
adaptation
to
be
accomplished
within
the
child
a
work
which
is
by
no
means
the
same
thing
as
any
external
work
or
production
whatsoever
this
is
the
aim
which
underlies
my
method
of
infant
education
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
certain
principles
which
it
enunciates
together
with
that
part
which
deals
with
the
technique
of
their
practical
application
are
not
of
a
general
character
but
have
special
reference
to
the
particular
case
of
the
child
from
three
to
seven
years
of
age
to
the
needs
of
a
formative
period
of
life
my
method
is
scientific
both
in
its
substance
and
in
its
aim
it
makes
for
the
attainment
of
a
more
advanced
stage
of
progress
in
directions
no
longer
only
material
and
physiological
it
is
an
endeavor
to
complete
the
course
which
hygiene
has
already
taken
but
in
the
treatment
of
the
physical
side
alone
if
we
possessed
statistics
respecting
the
nervous
debility
defects
of
speech
errors
of
perception
and
of
reasoning
and
lack
of
character
in
normal
children
it
would
perhaps
be
interesting
to
compare
them
with
statistics
of
the
same
nature
but
compiled
from
the
study
of
children
who
have
had
a
number
of
years
of
rational
education
in
all
probability
we
should
find
a
striking
resemblance
between
such
statistics
and
those
available
showing
the
decrease
in
mortality
and
the
improvement
in
the
physical
development
of
children
a
children
house
the
children
house
is
the
which
is
offered
to
the
child
that
he
may
be
given
the
opportunity
of
developing
his
activities
this
kind
of
school
is
not
of
a
fixed
type
but
may
vary
according
to
the
financial
resources
at
disposal
and
to
the
opportunities
afforded
by
the
environment
it
ought
to
be
a
real
house
that
is
to
say
a
set
of
rooms
with
a
garden
of
which
the
children
are
the
masters
a
garden
which
contains
shelters
is
ideal
because
the
children
can
play
or
sleep
under
them
and
can
also
bring
their
tables
out
to
work
or
dine
in
this
way
they
may
live
almost
entirely
in
the
open
air
and
are
protected
at
the
same
time
from
rain
and
sun
the
central
and
principal
room
of
the
building
often
also
the
only
room
at
the
disposal
of
the
children
is
the
room
for
intellectual
work
to
this
central
room
can
be
added
other
smaller
rooms
according
to
the
means
and
opportunities
of
the
place
for
example
a
bathroom
a
a
little
parlor
or
a
room
for
manual
work
a
gymnasium
and
the
special
characteristic
of
the
equipment
of
these
houses
is
that
it
is
adapted
for
children
and
not
adults
they
contain
not
only
didactic
material
specially
fitted
for
the
intellectual
development
of
the
child
but
also
a
complete
equipment
for
the
management
of
the
miniature
family
the
furniture
is
light
so
that
the
children
can
move
it
about
and
it
is
painted
in
some
light
color
so
that
the
children
can
wash
it
with
soap
and
water
there
are
low
tables
of
various
sizes
and
shapes
square
rectangular
and
round
large
and
small
the
rectangular
shape
is
the
most
common
as
two
or
more
children
can
work
at
it
together
the
seats
are
small
wooden
chairs
but
there
are
also
small
wicker
armchairs
and
sofas
illustration
fig
cupboard
with
apparatus
in
the
there
are
two
indispensable
pieces
of
furniture
one
of
these
is
a
very
long
cupboard
with
large
doors
fig
it
is
very
low
so
that
a
small
child
can
set
on
the
top
of
it
small
objects
such
as
mats

cupboard
is
kept
the
didactic
material
which
is
the
common
property
of
all
the
children
the
other
is
a
chest
of
drawers
containing
two
or
three
columns
of
little
drawers
each
of
which
has
a
bright
handle
or
a
handle
of
some
color
to
contrast
with
the
background
and
a
small
card
with
a
name
upon
it
every
child
has
his
own
drawer
in
which
to
put
things
belonging
to
him
round
the
walls
of
the
room
are
fixed
blackboards
at
a
low
level
so
that
the
children
can
write
or
draw
on
them
and
pleasing
artistic
pictures
which
are
changed
from
time
to
time
as
circumstances
direct
the
pictures
represent
children
families
landscapes
flowers
and
fruit
and
more
often
biblical
and
historical
incidents
ornamental
plants
and
flowering
plants
ought
always
to
be
placed
in
the
room
where
the
children
are
at
work
another
part
of
the
equipment
is
seen
in
the
pieces
of
carpet
of
various
colors
red
blue
pink
green
and
brown
the
children
spread
these
rugs
upon
the
floor
sit
upon
them
and
work
there
with
the
didactic
material
a
room
of
this
kind
is
larger
than
the
customary
not
only
because
the
little
tables
and
separate
chairs
take
up
more
space
but
also
because
a
large
part
of
the
floor
must
be
free
for
the
children
to
spread
their
rugs
and
work
upon
them
in
the
or
a
kind
of
parlor
in
which
the
children
amuse
themselves
by
conversation
games
or
music
the
furnishings
should
be
especially
tasteful
little
tables
of
different
sizes
little
armchairs
and
sofas
should
be
placed
here
and
there
many
brackets
of
all
kinds
and
sizes
upon
which
may
be
put
statuettes
artistic
vases
or
framed
photographs
should
adorn
the
walls
and
above
all
each
child
should
have
a
little
in
which
he
may
sow
the
seed
of
some
indoor
plant
to
tend
and
cultivate
it
as
it
grows
on
the
tables
of
this
should
be
placed
large
albums
of
colored
pictures
and
also
games
of
patience
or
various
geometric
solids
with
which
the
children
can
play
at
pleasure
constructing
figures

a
piano
or
better
other
musical
instruments
possibly
harps

small
dimensions

especially
for
children

the
teacher
may
sometimes
entertain
the
children
with
stories
which
will
attract
a
circle
of
interested
listeners
the
furniture
of
the
consists
in
addition
to
the
tables
of
low
cupboards
accessible
to
all
the
children
who
can
themselves
put
in
their
place
and
take
away
the
crockery
spoons
knives
and
forks
and
napkins
the
plates
are
always
of
china
and
the
tumblers
and
of
glass
knives
are
always
included
in
the
table
equipment
here
each
child
has
his
own
little
cupboard
or
shelf
in
the
middle
of
the
room
there
are
very
simple
washstands
consisting
of
tables
on
each
of
which
stand
a
small
basin
soap
and
against
the
wall
stand
little
sinks
with
here
the
children
may
draw
and
pour
away
their
water
there
is
no
limit
to
the
equipment
of
the
children

the
children
themselves

as
regards
their
personal
toilet
the
children
know
how
to
dress
and
undress
themselves
they
hang
their
clothes
on
little
hooks
placed
very
low
so
as
to
be
within
reach
of
a
little
child
or
else
they
fold
up
such
articles
of
clothing
as
their
little
of
which
they
take
great
care
and
lay
them
inside
a
cupboard
kept
for
the
household
linen
in
short
where
the
manufacture
of
toys
has
been
brought
to
such
a
point
of
complication
and
perfection
that
children
have
at
their
disposal
entire
dolls
houses
complete
wardrobes
for
the
dressing
and
undressing
of
dolls
kitchens
where
they
can
pretend
to
cook
toy
animals
as
nearly
lifelike
as
possible
this
method
seeks
to
give
all
this
to
the
child
in
reality
making
him
an
actor
in
a
living
scene
illustration
fig
the
montessori
paedometer
my
pedometer
forms
part
of
the
equipment
of
a
children
house
after
various
modifications
i
have
now
reduced
this
instrument
to
a
very
practical
form
fig
the
purpose
of
the
pedometer
as
its
name
shows
is
to
measure
the
children
it
consists
of
a
wide
rectangular
board
forming
the
base
from
the
center
of
which
rise
two
wooden
posts
held
together
at
the
top
by
a
narrow
flat
piece
of
metal
to
each
post
is
connected
a
horizontal
metal
rod
the
indicator
which
runs
up
and
down
by
means
of
a
casing
also
of
metal
this
metal
casing
is
made
in
one
piece
with
the
indicator
to
the
end
of
which
is
fixed
an
ball
on
one
side
that
is
to
say
behind
one
of
the
two
tall
vertical
wooden
posts
there
is
a
small
seat
also
of
wood
the
two
tall
wooden
posts
are
graduated
the
post
to
which
the
seat
is
fixed
is
graduated
from
the
surface
of
the
seat
to
the
top
whilst
the
other
is
graduated
from
the
wooden
board
at
the
base
to
the
top
to
a
height
of
meters
on
the
side
containing
the
seat
the
height
of
the
child
seated
is
measured
on
the
other
side
the
child
full
stature
the
practical
value
of
this
instrument
lies
in
the
possibility
of
measuring
two
children
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
fact
that
the
children
themselves
cooperate
in
taking
the
measurements
in
fact
they
learn
to
take
off
their
shoes
and
to
place
themselves
in
the
correct
position
on
the
pedometer
they
find
no
difficulty
in
raising
and
lowering
the
metal
indicators
which
are
held
so
firmly
in
place
by
means
of
the
metal
casing
that
they
can
not
deviate
from
their
horizontal
position
even
when
used
by
inexpert
hands
moreover
they
run
extremely
easily
so
that
very
little
strength
is
required
to
move
them
the
little
balls
prevent
the
children
from
hurting
themselves
should
they
inadvertently
knock
their
heads
against
the
metal
indicator
the
children
are
very
fond
of
the
pedometer
shall
we
measure
ourselves
is
one
of
the
proposals
which
they
make
most
willingly
and
with
the
greatest
likelihood
of
finding
many
of
their
companions
to
join
them
they
also
take
great
care
of
the
pedometer
dusting
it
and
polishing
its
metal
parts
all
the
surfaces
of
the
pedometer
are
so
smooth
and
well
polished
that
they
invite
the
care
that
is
taken
of
them
and
by
their
appearance
when
finished
fully
repay
the
trouble
taken
the
pedometer
represents
the
scientific
part
of
the
method
because
it
has
reference
to
the
anthropological
and
psychological
study
made
of
the
children
each
of
whom
has
his
own
biographical
record
this
biographical
record
follows
the
history
of
the
child
development
according
to
the
observations
which
it
is
possible
to
make
by
the
application
of
my
method
this
subject
is
dealt
with
at
length
in
my
other
books
a
series
of
cinematograph
pictures
has
been
taken
of
the
pedometer
at
a
moment
when
the
children
are
being
measured
they
are
seen
coming
of
their
own
accord
even
the
very
smallest
to
take
their
places
at
the
instrument
the
method
the
technique
of
my
method
as
it
follows
the
guidance
of
the
natural
physiological
and
psychical
development
of
the
child
may
be
divided
into
three
parts
motor
education
sensory
education
language
the
care
and
management
of
the
environment
itself
afford
the
principal
means
of
motor
education
while
sensory
education
and
the
education
of
language
are
provided
for
by
my
didactic
material
the
didactic
material
for
the
of
the
consists
of
three
sets
of
solid

counting
the
volume

belonging
specially
to
the
method
and
colored
pencils
the
frames
for
lacing
buttoning
which
are
used
for
the
education
of
the
movements
of
the
hand
motor
education
the
education
of
the
movements
is
very
complex
as
it
must
correspond
to
all
the
coordinated
movements
which
the
child
has
to
establish
in
his
physiological
organism
the
child
if
left
without
guidance
is
disorderly
in
his
movements
and
these
disorderly
movements
are
the
characteristic
of
the
little
in
fact
he
never
keeps
still
and
touches
everything
this
is
what
forms
the
unruliness
and
naughtiness
the
adult
would
deal
with
him
by
checking
these
movements
with
the
monotonous
and
useless
repetition
keep
still
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
these
movements
the
little
one
is
seeking
the
very
exercise
which
will
organize
and
coordinate
the
movements
useful
to
man
we
must
therefore
desist
from
the
useless
attempt
to
reduce
the
child
to
a
state
of
immobility
we
should
rather
give
order
to
his
movements
leading
them
to
those
actions
towards
which
his
efforts
are
actually
tending
this
is
the
aim
of
muscular
education
at
this
age
once
a
direction
is
given
to
them
the
child
movements
are
made
towards
a
definite
end
so
that
he
himself
grows
quiet
and
contented
and
becomes
an
active
worker
a
being
calm
and
full
of
joy
this
education
of
the
movements
is
one
of
the
principal
factors
in
producing
that
outward
appearance
of
discipline
to
be
found
in
the
houses
i
have
already
spoken
at
length
on
this
subject
in
my
other
books
muscular
education
has
reference
to
the
primary
movements
of
everyday
life
walking
rising
sitting
handling
objects
the
care
of
the
person
management
of
the
household
gardening
manual
work
gymnastic
exercises
rhythmic
movements
illustration
fig
frames
for
lacing
and
buttoning
in
the
care
of
the
person
the
first
step
is
that
of
dressing
and
undressing
for
this
end
there
is
in
my
didactic
material
a
collection
of
frames
to
which
are
attached
pieces
of
stuff
leather
etc
these
can
be
buttoned
hooked
tied
together
in
fact
joined
in
all
the
different
ways
which
our
civilization
has
invented
for
fastening
our
clothing
shoes
etc
fig
the
teacher
sitting
by
the
side
performs
the
necessary
movements
of
the
fingers
very
slowly
and
deliberately
separating
the
movements
themselves
into
their
different
parts
and
letting
them
be
seen
clearly
and
minutely
for
example
one
of
the
first
actions
will
be
the
adjustment
of
the
two
pieces
of
stuff
in
such
a
way
that
the
edges
to
be
fastened
together
touch
one
another
from
top
to
bottom
then
if
it
is
a
the
teacher
will
show
the
child
the
different
stages
of
the
action
she
will
take
hold
of
the
button
set
it
opposite
the
buttonhole
make
it
enter
the
buttonhole
completely
and
adjust
it
carefully
in
its
place
above
in
the
same
way
to
teach
a
child
to
tie
a
bow
she
will
separate
the
stage
in
which
he
ties
the
ribbons
together
from
that
in
which
he
makes
the
bows
in
the
cinematograph
film
there
is
a
picture
which
shows
an
entire
lesson
in
the
tying
of
the
bows
with
the
ribbons
these
lessons
are
not
necessary
for
all
the
children
as
they
learn
from
one
another
and
of
their
own
accord
come
with
great
patience
to
analyze
the
movements
performing
them
separately
very
slowly
and
carefully
the
child
can
sit
in
a
comfortable
position
and
hold
his
frame
on
the
table
fig
as
he
fastens
and
unfastens
the
same
frame
many
times
over
with
great
interest
he
acquires
an
unusual
deftness
of
hand
and
becomes
possessed
with
the
desire
to
fasten
real
clothes
whenever
he
has
the
opportunity
we
see
the
smallest
children
to
dress
themselves
and
their
companions
they
go
in
search
of
amusement
of
this
kind
and
defend
themselves
with
all
their
might
against
the
adult
who
would
try
to
help
them

the
teaching
of
the
other
and
larger
movements
such
as
washing
setting
the
table
the
directress
must
at
the
beginning
intervene
teaching
the
child
with
few
or
no
words
at
all
but
with
very
precise
actions
she
teaches
all
the
movements
how
to
sit
to
rise
from
one
seat
to
take
up
and
lay
down
objects
and
to
offer
them
gracefully
to
others
in

she
teaches
the
children
to
set
the
plates
one
upon
the
other
and
lay
them
on
the
table
without
making
any
noise
the
children
learn
easily
and
show
an
interest
and
surprising
care
in
the
performance
of
these
actions
in
classes
where
there
are
many
children

is
necessary

arrange
for
the
children
to
take
turns
in
the
various
household
duties
such
as
housework
serving
at
table
and
washing
dishes
the
children
readily
respect
such
a
system
of
turns
there
is
no
need
to
ask
them
to
do
this
work
for
they
come
spontaneously
even
little
ones
of
two
and
a
half
years
old
to
offer
to
do
their
share
and
it
is
frequently
most
touching
to
watch
their
efforts
to
imitate
to
remember
and
finally
to
conquer
their
difficulty
professor
jacoby
of
new
york
was
once
much
moved
as
he
watched
a
child
who
was
little
more
than
two
years
old
and
not
at
all
intelligent
in
appearance
standing
perplexed
because
he
could
not
remember
whether
the
fork
should
be
set
at
the
right
hand
or
the
left
he
remained
a
long
while
meditating
and
evidently
using
all
the
powers
of
his
mind
the
other
children
older
than
he
watched
him
with
admiration
marveling
like
ourselves
at
the
life
developing
under
our
eyes
the
instructions
of
the
teacher
consist
then
merely
in
a
hint
a
touch
enough
to
give
a
start
to
the
child
the
rest
develops
of
itself
the
children
learn
from
one
another
and
throw
themselves
into
the
work
with
enthusiasm
and
delight
this
atmosphere
of
quiet
activity
develops
a
an
attitude
of
mutual
aid
and
most
wonderful
of
all
an
intelligent
interest
on
the
part
of
the
older
children
in
the
progress
of
their
little
companions
it
is
enough
just
to
set
a
child
in
these
peaceful
surroundings
for
him
to
feel
perfectly
at
home
in
the
cinematograph
pictures
the
actual
work
in
a
children
house
may
be
seen
the
children
are
moving
about
each
one
fulfilling
his
own
task
whilst
the
teacher
is
in
a
corner
watching
pictures
were
taken
also
of
the
children
engaged
in
the
care
of
the
house
that
is
in
the
care
both
of
their
persons
and
of
their
surroundings

in
the
work
of
laying
the

the
children
are
seen
quite
by
themselves
dividing
the
work
among
themselves
carrying
the
plates

and
forks
and
finally
sitting
down
at
the
tables

gardening
and
manual
work
are
a
great
pleasure
to
our
children
gardening
is
already
well
known
as
a
feature
of
infant
education
and
it
is
recognized
by
all
that
plants
and
animals
attract
the
care
and
attention
the
ideal
of
the
children
houses
in
this
respect
is
to
imitate
the
best
in
the
present
usage
of
those
schools
which
owe
their
inspiration
more
or
less
to
mrs
latter
for
manual
instruction
we
have
chosen
clay
work
consisting
of
the
construction
of

these

be
made
with
the
help
of
simple
instruments
such
as
molds
the
completion
of
the
work
should
be
the
aim
always
kept
in
view
and
finally
all
the
little
objects
made
by
the
children
should
be
glazed
and
baked
in
the
furnace
the
children
themselves
learn
to
line
a
wall
with
shining
white
or
colored
tiles
wrought
in
various
designs
or
with
the
help
of
mortar
and
a
trowel
to
cover
the
floor
with
little
bricks
they
also
dig
out
foundations
and
then
use
their
bricks
to
build
division
walls
or
entire
little
houses
for
the
chickens
among
the
gymnastic
exercises
that
which
must
be
considered
the
most
important
is
that
of
the
line
a
line
is
described
in
chalk
or
paint
upon
a
large
space
of
floor
instead
of
one
line
there
may
also
be
two
concentric
lines
elliptical
in
form
the
children
are
taught
to
walk
upon
these
lines
like
walkers
placing
their
feet
one
in
front
of
the
other
to
keep
their
balance
they
make
efforts
exactly
similar
to
those
of
real
walkers
except
that
they
have
no
danger
with
which
to
reckon
as
the
lines
are
only
upon
the
floor
the
teacher
herself
performs
the
exercise
showing
clearly
how
she
sets
her
feet
and
the
children
imitate
her
without
any
necessity
for
her
to
speak
at
first
it
is
only
certain
children
who
follow
her
and
when
she
has
shown
them
how
to
do
it
she
withdraws
leaving
the
phenomenon
to
develop
of
itself
the
children
for
the
most
part
continue
to
walk
adapting
their
feet
with
great
care
to
the
movement
they
have
seen
and
making
efforts
to
keep
their
balance
so
as
not
to
fall
gradually
the
other
children
draw
near
and
watch
and
also
make
an
attempt
very
little
time
elapses
before
the
whole
of
the
two
ellipses
or
the
one
line
is
covered
with
children
balancing
themselves
and
continuing
to
walk
round
watching
their
feet
with
an
expression
of
deep
attention
on
their
faces
music
may
then
be
used
it
should
be
a
very
simple
march
the
rhythm
of
which
is
not
obvious
at
first
but
which
accompanies
and
enlivens
the
spontaneous
efforts
of
the
children
when
they
have
learned
in
this
way
to
master
their
balance
the
children
have
brought
the
act
of
walking
to
a
remarkable
standard
of
perfection
and
have
acquired
in
addition
to
security
and
composure
in
their
natural
gait
an
unusually
graceful
carriage
of
the
body
the
exercise
on
the
line
can
afterwards
be
made
more
complicated
in
various
ways
the
first
application
is
that
of
calling
forth
rhythmic
exercise
by
the
sound
of
a
march
upon
the
piano
when
the
same
march
is
repeated
during
several
days
the
children
end
by
feeling
the
rhythm
and
by
following
it
with
movements
of
their
arms
and
feet
they
also
accompany
the
exercises
on
the
line
with
songs
little
by
little
the
music
is
by
the
children
they
finish
as
in
miss
george
school
at
washington
by
singing
over
their
daily
work
with
the
didactic
material
the
children
house
then
resembles
a
hive
of
bees
humming
as
they
work
as
to
the
little
gymnasium
of
which
i
speak
in
my
book
on
the
method
one
piece
of
apparatus
is
particularly
practical
this
is
the
fence
from
which
the
children
hang
by
their
arms
freeing
their
legs
from
the
heavy
weight
of
the
body
and
strengthening
the
arms
this
fence
has
also
the
advantage
of
being
useful
in
a
garden
for
the
purpose
of
dividing
one
part
from
another
as
for
example
the
from
the
garden
walks
and
it
does
not
detract
in
any
way
from
the
appearance

my

material
offers
to
the
child
the
for
what
may
be
called
sensory
education
in
the
box
of
material
the
first
three
objects
which
are
likely
to
attract
the
attention
of
a
little
child
from
two
and
a
half
to
three
years
old
are
three
solid
pieces
of
wood
in
each
of
which
is
inserted
a
row
of
ten
small
cylinders
or
sometimes
discs
all
furnished
with
a
button
for
a
handle
in
the
first
case
there
is
a
row
of
cylinders
of
the
same
height
but
with
a
diameter
which
decreases
from
thick
to
thin
fig
in
the
second
there
are
cylinders
which
decrease
in
all
dimensions
and
so
are
either
larger
or
smaller
but
always
of
the
same
shape
fig
lastly
in
the
third
case
the
cylinders
have
the
same
diameter
but
vary
in
height
so
that
as
the
size
decreases
the
cylinder
gradually
becomes
a
little
disc
in
form
fig
the
first
cylinders
vary
in
two
dimensions
the
section
the
second
in
all
three
dimensions
the
third
in
one
dimension
height
the
order
which
i
have
given
refers
to
the
degree
of
with
which
the
child
performs
the
exercises
the
exercise
consists
in
taking
out
the
cylinders
mixing
them
and
putting
them
back
in
the
right
place
it
is
performed
by
the
child
as
he
sits
in
a
comfortable
position
at
a
little
table
he
exercises
his
hands
in
the
delicate
act
of
taking
hold
of
the
button
with
the
tips
of
one
or
two
fingers
and
in
the
little
movements
of
the
hand
and
arm
as
he
mixes
the
cylinders
letting
them
and
making
too
much
and
puts
them
back
again
each
in
its
own
place
in
these
exercises
the
teacher
may
in
the
first
instance
intervene
merely
taking
out
the
cylinders
mixing
them
carefully
on
the
table
and
then
showing
the
child
that
he
is
to
put
them
back
but
without
performing
the
action
herself
such
intervention
however
is
almost
always
found
to
be
unnecessary
for
the
children
their
companions
at
work
and
thus
are
encouraged
to
imitate
them
they
like
to
do
it
in
fact
sometimes
almost
in
private
for
fear
of
inopportune
help
fig
illustration
fig

using
case
of

but
how
is
the
child
to
find
the
right
place
for
each
of
the
little
cylinders
which
lie
mixed
upon
the
table
he
first
makes
trials
it
often
happens
that
he
places
a
cylinder
which
is
too
large
for
the
empty
hole
over
which
he
puts
it
then
changing
its
place
he
tries
others
until
the
cylinder
goes
in
again
the
contrary
may
happen
that
is
to
say
the
cylinder
may
slip
too
easily
into
a
hole
too
big
for
it
in
that
case
it
has
taken
a
place
which
does
not
belong
to
it
at
all
but
to
a
larger
cylinder
in
this
way
one
cylinder
at
the
end
will
be
left
out
without
a
place
and
it
will
not
be
possible
to
find
one
that
fits
here
the
child
can
not
help
seeing
his
mistake
in
concrete
form
he
is
perplexed
his
little
mind
is
faced
with
a
problem
which
interests
him
intensely
before
all
the
cylinders
fitted
now
there
is
one
that
will
not
fit
the
little
one
stops
frowning
deep
in
thought
he
begins
to
feel
the
little
buttons
and
finds
that
some
cylinders
have
too
much
room
he
thinks
that
perhaps
they
are
out
of
their
right
place
and
tries
to
place
them
correctly
he
repeats
the
process
again
and
again
and
finally
he
succeeds
then
it
is
that
he
breaks
into
a
smile
of
triumph
the
exercise
arouses
the
intelligence
of
the
child
he
wants
to
repeat
it
right
from
the
beginning
and
having
learned
by
experience
he
makes
another
attempt
little
children
from
three
to
three
and
a
half
years
old
have
repeated
the
exercise
up
to
times
without
losing
their
interest
in
it
if
the
second
set
of
cylinders
and
then
the
third
are
presented
the
of
shape
strikes
the
child
and
reawakens
his
interest
the
material
which
i
have
described
serves
to
the
to
distinguish
in
for
the
child
ends
by
being
able
to
recognize
at
a
glance
the
larger
or
the
smaller
hole
which
exactly
fits
the
cylinder
which
he
holds
in
his
hand
the
educative
process
is
based
on
this
that
the
control
of
the
error
lies
in
material
and
the
child
has
concrete
evidence
of
it
the
desire
of
the
child
to
attain
an
end
which
he
knows
leads
him
to
correct
himself
it
is
not
a
teacher
who
makes
him
notice
his
mistake
and
shows
him
how
to
correct
it
but
it
is
a
complex
work
of
the
child
own
intelligence
which
leads
to
such
a
result
hence
at
this
point
there
begins
the
process
of
the
aim
is
not
an
external
one
that
is
to
say
it
is
the
object
that
the
child
should
learn
how
to
place
the
cylinders
and
he
should
know
how
to
perform
an
the
aim
is
an
inner
one
namely
that
the
child
train
himself
to
observe
that
he
be
led
to
make
comparisons
between
objects
to
form
judgments
to
reason
and
to
decide
and
it
is
in
the
indefinite
repetition
of
this
exercise
of
attention
and
of
intelligence
that
a
real
development
ensues
illustration

on

the
others

order
of
size
to

very
smallest
fig
as
soon
as
he
has
built
the
tower
the
child
with
a
blow
of
his
hand
knocks
it
down
so
that
the
cubes
are
scattered
on
the
carpet
and
then
he
builds
it
up
again

child
scatters

pieces

he
places
them
in

colored

all
of
which
have

section
of

vary
by

centimeters
in
length
from
ten
centimeters
to

fig
the
child
scatters
the
ten
rods
on
a
large
carpet
and
mixes
them
at
random
and
by
comparing
rod
with
rod
he
arranges
them
according
to
their
order
of
length
so
that
they
take
the
form
of
a
set
of
organ
pipes
as
usual
the
teacher
by
doing
the
exercises
herself
first
shows
the
child
how
the
pieces
of
each
set
should
be
arranged
but
it
will
often
happen
that
the
child
learns
not
directly
from
her
but
by
watching
his
companions
she
will
however
always
continue
to
watch
the
children
never
losing
sight
of
their
efforts
and
any
correction
of
hers
will
be
directed
more
towards
preventing
rough
or
disorderly
use
of
the
material
than
towards
any
which
the
child
may
make
in
placing
the
rods
in
their
order
of
gradation
the
reason
is
that
the
mistakes
which
the
child
makes
by
placing
for
example
a
small
cube
beneath
one
that
is
larger
are
caused
by
his
own
lack
of
education
and
it
is
the
of
the
which
by
refining
his
powers
of
observation
will
lead
him
sooner
or
later
to
sometimes
it
happens
that
a
child
working
with
the
long
rods
makes
the
most
glaring
mistakes
as
the
aim
of
the
exercise
however
is
that
the
rods
be
arranged
in
the
right
order
of
gradation
but
that
the
child
practise
by
there
is
no
need
to
intervene
one
day
the
child
will
arrange
all
the
rods
in
their
right
order
and
then
full
of
joy
he
will
call
the
teacher
to
come
and
admire
them
the
object
of
the
exercise
will
thus
be
achieved
these
three
sets
the
cubes
the
prisms
and
the
rods
cause
the
child
to
move
about
and
to
handle
and
carry
objects
which
are
difficult
for
him
to
grasp
with
his
little
hand
again
by
their
use
he
repeats
the
of
the
to
the
recognition
of
differences
of
size
between
similar
objects
the
exercise
would
seem
easier
from
the
sensory
point
of
view
than
the
other
with
the
cylinders
described
above
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
more
difficult
as
there
is
control
of
the
error
in
the
material
it
is
the
child
eye
alone
which
can
furnish
the
control
hence
the
difference
between
the
objects
should
strike
the
eye
at
once
for
that
reason
larger
objects
are
used
and
the
necessary
visual
power
presupposes
a
previous
preparation
provided
for
in
the
exercise

them

tips
of
his
fingers

seconds

water
graduated
exercises
for
the
thermic
sense
may
also
have
their
place
here
as
has
been
explained
in
my
book
on
the
method
after
this
the
child
is
taught
to
pass
the
soft
cushioned
tips
of
his
fingers
lightly
as
over
the
two
separate
surfaces
that
he
may
appreciate
their
difference
the
delicate

and
forwards
of
the
suspended
hand
as
it
is
brought
into
light
contact
with
the
surface
is
an
excellent
exercise
in
control
the
little
hand
which
has
just
been
cleansed
and
given
its
tepid
bath
gains
much
in
grace
and
beauty
and
the
whole
exercise
is
the
first
step
in
the
education
of
the
tactile
sense
which
holds
such
an
important
place
in
my
method
when
initiating
the
child
into
the
education
of
the
sense
of
touch
the
teacher
must
always
take
an
active
part
the
first
time
not
only
must
she
show
the
child
how
it
is
done
her
interference
is
a
little
more
definite
still
for
she
takes
hold
of
his
hand
and
guides
it
to
touch
the
surfaces
with
the
in
the
lightest
possible
way
she
will
make
no
explanations
her
words
will
be
rather
to
the
child
with
his
hand
to
perceive
the
different
sensations
when
he
has
perceived
them
it
is
then
that
he
repeats
the
act
by
himself
in
the
delicate
way
which
he
has
been
taught

himself

exercises
in
touching
these
surfaces
not
only
refining
his
capacity
for
perceiving
tactile
differences
which
are
always
growing
more
similar
but
also
perfecting
the
movement
of
which
he
is
ever
gaining
greater
mastery

similar
pieces
of
each
kind
of
stuff

and
vivid
colors
the

is

new
movement
where
before

must
now
the
stuffs
which

the
degree

fineness

coarseness
from
coarse

to
fine
silk
are
felt
with
movements
correspondingly
decisive

delicate
the
child
whose
hand
is
already
practised
finds
the
greatest
pleasure
in
feeling
the
stuffs
and
almost
instinctively
in
order
to
enhance
his
appreciation
of
the
tactile
sensation
he
closes
his
eyes
then
to
spare
himself
the
exertion
he
blindfolds
himself
with
a
clean
handkerchief
and
as
he
feels
the
stuffs
he
arranges
the
similar
pieces
in
pairs

upon
the
other

taking
off

handkerchief
he
ascertains
for
himself
whether
he
has
made
any
mistake
this
exercise
in
and
is
peculiarly
attractive
to
the
child
and
induces
him
to
seek
similar

by

will
be

to
go
and
wash

infinite
delicacy

meanwhile
expressing
his
pleasure
and
interest
a
little
later
we
shall
see
the
children
interest
themselves
in
a
much
more
difficult
exercise
illustration
fig
wood
tablets
differing
in
weight
there
are
some
little
rectangular
tablets
which
form
part
of
the
material
fig
the
tablets
though
of
identical
size
are
made
of
wood
of
varying
qualities
so
that
they
differ
in
weight
and
through
the
property
of
the
wood
in
color
also
the
child
has
to
take
a
tablet
and
rest
it
delicately
on
the
inner
surfaces
of
his
four
fingers
spreading
them
well
out
this
will
be
another
opportunity
of
teaching
delicate
movements
the
hand
must
move
up
and
down
as
though
to
weigh
the
object
but
the
movement
must
be
as
imperceptible
as
possible
these
little
movements
should
diminish
as
the
capacity
and
attention
for
perceiving
the
weight
of
the
object
becomes
more
acute
and
the
exercise
will
be
perfectly
performed
when
the
child
comes
to
perceive
the
weight
almost
without
any
movement
of
the
hands
it
is
only
by
the
repetition
of
the
attempts
that
such
a
result
can
be
obtained
once
the
children
are
initiated
into
it
by
the
teacher
they
blindfold
their
eyes
and
repeat
by
themselves
these
exercises
of
the
for
example
they
lay
the
heavier
wooden
tablets
on
the
right
and
the
lighter
on
the
left
when
the
child
takes
off
the
handkerchief
he
can
see
by
the
color
of
the
pieces
of
wood
if
he
has
made
a
mistake
a
long
time
before
this
difficult
exercise
and
during
the
period
when
the
child
is
working
with
the
three
sorts
of
geometrical
solids
and
with
the
rough
and
smooth
tablets
he
can
be
exercising
himself
with
a
material
which
is
very
attractive
to
him
this
is
the
set
of
tablets
covered
with
bright
silk
of
shaded
colors
the
set
consists
of
two
separate
boxes
each
containing
colors
that
is
eight
different
tints
each
of
which
has
eight
shades
carefully
graded
the
first
exercise
for
the
child
is
that
of
the
that
is
he
selects
from
a
mixed
heap
of
colors
the
two
tablets
which
are
alike
and
lays
them
out
one
beside
the
other
the
teacher
naturally
does
not
offer
the
child
all
the
one
hundred
and
tablets
in
a
heap
but
chooses
only
a
few
of
the
brighter
colors
for
example
red
blue
and
yellow
and
prepares
and
mixes
up
three
or
four
pairs
then
taking
one
tablet
perhaps
the
red
one
she
indicates
to
the
child
that
he
is
to
choose
its
counterpart
from
the
heap
this
done
the
teacher
lays
the
pair
together
on
the
table
then
she
takes
perhaps
the
blue
and
the
child
selects
the
tablet
to
form
another
pair
the
teacher
then
mixes
the
tablets
again
for
the
child
to
repeat
the
exercise
by
himself
to
select
the
two
red
tablets
the
two
blue
the
two
yellow
and
to
place
the
two
members
of
each
pair
next
to
one
another
then
the
couples
will
be
increased
to
four
or
five
and
little
children
of
three
years
old
end
by
pairing
of
their
own
accord
ten
or
a
dozen
couples
of
mixed
tablets
illustration
color
spools
when
the
child
has
given
his
eye
sufficient
practise
in
recognizing
the
identity
of
the
pairs
of
colors
he
is
offered
the
shades
of
one
color
only
and
he
exercises
himself
in
the
perception
of
the
slightest
differences
of
shade
in
every
color
take
for
example
the
blue
series
there
are
eight
tablets
in
graduated
shades
the
teacher
places
them
one
beside
another
beginning
with
the
darkest
with
the
sole
object
of
making
the
child
understand
what
is
to
be
done
she
then
leaves
him
alone
to
the
interesting
attempts
which
he
spontaneously
makes
it
often
happens
that
the
child
makes
a
mistake
if
he
has
understood
the
idea
and
makes
a
mistake
it
is
a
sign
that
has
not
yet
reached
the
of
perceiving
the
differences
between
the
graduations
of
one
color
it
is
practise
which
perfects
in
the
child
that
capacity
for
distinguishing
the
fine
differences
and
so
we
leave
him
alone
to
his
attempts
there
are
two
suggestions
that
we
can
make
to
help
him
the
first
is
that
he
should
always
select
the
darkest
color
from
the
pile
this
suggestion
greatly
facilitates
his
choice
by
giving
it
a
constant
direction
secondly
we
can
lead
him
to
observe
from
time
to
time
any
two
colors
that
stand
next
to
each
other
in
order
to
compare
them
directly
and
apart
from
the
others
in
this
way
the
child
does
not
place
a
tablet
without
a
particular
and
careful
comparison
with
its
neighbor
finally
the
child
himself
will
love
to
mix
the
colors
and
then
to
arrange
them
in
eight
rows
of
pretty
shades
of
color
with
really
surprising
skill
in
this
exercise
also
the
child
hand
is
educated
to
perform
fine
and
delicate
movements
and
his
mind
is
afforded
special
training
in
attention
he
must
not
take
hold
of
the
tablets
anyhow
he
must
avoid
touching
the
colored
silk
and
must
handle
the
tablets
instead
by
the
pieces
of
wood
at
the
top
and
bottom
to
arrange
the
tablets
next
to
one
another
in
a
straight
line
at
exactly
the
same
level
so
that
the
series
looks
like
a
beautiful
shaded
ribbon
is
an
act
which
demands
a
manual
skill
only
obtained
after
considerable
practise
these
exercises
of
the
chromatic
sense
lead
in
the
case
of
the
older
children
to
the
development
of
the
color
memory
a
child
having
looked
carefully
at
a
color
is
then
invited
to
look
for
its
companion
in
a
mixed
group
of
colors
without
of
course
keeping
the
color
he
has
observed
under
his
eye
to
guide
him
it
is
therefore
by
his
memory
that
he
recognizes
the
color
which
he
no
longer
compares
with
a
reality
but
with
an
image
impressed
upon
his
mind
the
children
are
very
fond
of
this
exercise
in
color
memory
it
makes
a
lively
digression
for
them
as
they
run
with
the
image
of
a
color
in
their
minds
and
look
for
its
corresponding
reality
in
their
surroundings
it
is
a
real
triumph
for
them
to
identify
the
idea
with
the
corresponding
reality
and
to
in
their
the
proof
of
the
mental
power
they
have
acquired

to
show
the

only
a
few
figures
which
differ
very
widely
from

the
next
step
is
to

a
larger

after
this
to
present
consecutively
figures
more
and
more
similar

a
very
narrow
rectangle
a
triangle
a
circle
an
ellipse
and
a
hexagon
or
with
other
figures
in
combination
afterwards
the
teacher
object
will
be
to
arrange
figures
similar
to
one
another
in
the
frame
as
for
example
the
set
of
six
rectangles
six
triangles
six
circles
varying
in
size
etc
this
exercise
resembles
that
of
the
cylinders
the
insets
are
held
by
the
buttons
and
taken
from
their
places
they
are
then
mixed
on

the
child
is
invited
to
put
them
back

is
in

for
the
figure
can
not
be
inserted
perfectly
except
when
it
is
put
in
its
own
place
hence
a
series
of
experiments
of
attempts
which
end
in
victory
the
child
is
led
to
compare
the
various
forms
to
realize
in
a
concrete
way
the
differences
between
them

during

exercise
of
touching

outlines
of

geometrical

has
a
concrete
guide
in
the
object
this
is
especially
true
when
he
touches
the
frames
for
his
two
fingers

only
to
follow
the
edge
of
the
frame
which
acts
as
an
obstacle
and
is
a
very
clear
guide
the
teacher
must
always
intervene
at
the
start
to
teach
accurately
this
movement
which
will
have
such
an
importance
in
the
future
she
must
therefore
show
the
child
to
not
only
by
performing
the
movement
herself
slowly
and
clearly
but
also
by
guiding
the
child
hand
itself
during
his
first
attempts
so
that
he
is
sure
to
touch
all
the
details

and
sides
when
his
hand
has
learned
to
perform
these
movements
with
precision
and
accuracy
he
will
be
capable
of
following
the
outline
of
a
geometrical
figure

through
many
repetitions
of
the
exercise
he
will
come
to
coordinate
the
movement

the
exact
delineation
of
its
form
this
exercise
could
be
called
an
indirect

exercise
of

is
gradually

the
recognition

there
is
no
longer
the
concrete
control
of
error
in
the
material
as
there
was
in
the
insets
but
the
child
by
his
eye
alone
must
judge
of
identities
of
form
when
instead
of
the
wooden
forms
into
their
corresponding
apertures
he
simply
them
on

refinement
of
the
eye
power
of
discrimination
increases
every
time
the
child
passes
from
one
series
of
cards
to
the
next
and
by
the
time
that
he
has
reached
the
third
series
he
can
see
the
relation
between
a
wooden
object
which
he
holds
in
his
hand
and
an
outline

is
he
can
connect
the
concrete
reality
with
an
the
now
assumes
in
his
eyes
a
very
definite
meaning
and
he
accustoms
himself
to
recognize
to
interpret
and
to
judge
of
forms
contained
by
a
simple
outline
the
exercises
are
various
the
children
themselves
invent
them
some
love
to
spread
out
a
number
of
the
figures
of
the
geometric
insets
before
their
eyes
and
then
taking
a
handful
of
the
cards
and
mixing
them
like
playing
cards
deal
them
out
as
quickly
as
possible
choosing
the
figures
corresponding
to
the
pieces
then
as
a
test
of
their
choice
they
place
the
wooden
pieces
upon
the
forms
on
the
cards
at
this
exercise
they
often
cover
whole
tables
putting
the
wooden
figures
above
and
beneath
each
one
in
a
vertical
line
the
three
corresponding
forms
of
the
cardboard
series
another
game
invented
by
the
children
consists
in
putting
out
and
mixing
all
the
cards
of
the
three
series
on
two
or
three
adjoining
tables
the
child
then
takes
a
wooden
geometrical
form
and
places
it
as
quickly
as
possible
on
the
corresponding
cards
which
he
has
recognized
at
a
glance
among
all
the
rest
four
or
five
children
play
this
game
together
and
as
soon
as
one
of
them
has
found
for
example
the
figure
corresponding
to
the
wooden
piece
and
has
placed
the
piece
carefully
and
precisely
upon
it
another
child
takes
away
the
piece
in
order
to
place
it
on
the
same
form
in
outline
the
game
is
somewhat
suggestive
of
chess
many
children
without
any
suggestion
from
any
one
touch
with
the
finger
the
outline
of
the
figures
in
the
three

but
the
children
wanted
to
know
all
the
names
taking
pleasure
in
learning
even
the
most
difficult
such
as
trapezium
and
decagon
they
also
show
great
pleasure
in
listening
to
the
exact
pronunciation
of
new
words
and
in
their
repetition
early
childhood
is
in
fact
the
age
in
which
language
is
formed
and
in
which
the
sounds
of
a
foreign
language
can
be
perfectly
learned
when
the
child
has
had
long
practise
with
the
plane
insets
he
begins
to
make
discoveries
in
his
environment
recognizing
forms
colors
and
qualities
already
known
to
him
a
result
which
in
general
follows
after
all
the
sensory
exercises
then
it
is
that
a
great
enthusiasm
is
aroused
in
him
and
the
world
becomes
for
him
a
source
of
pleasure
a
little
boy
walking
one
day
alone
on
the
roof
terrace
repeated
to
himself
with
a
thoughtful
expression
on
his
face

sky
is
blue
the

once
a
cardinal
an
admirer
of
the
children
of
the
school
in
via
guisti
wished
himself
to
bring
them
some
biscuits
and
to
enjoy
the
sight
of
a
little
greediness
among
the
children
when
he
had
finished
his
distribution
instead
of
seeing
the
children
put
the
food
hastily
into
their
mouths
to
his
great
surprise
he
heard
them
call
out
a
triangle
a
circle
a
rectangle
in
fact
these
biscuits
were
made
in
geometrical
shapes
in
one
of
the
people
dwellings
at
milan
a
mother
preparing
the
dinner
in
the
kitchen
took
from
a
packet
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
her
little
boy
who
was
with
her
said
rectangle
the
woman
going
on
with
her
work
cut
off
a
large
corner
of
the
slice
of
bread
and
the
child
cried
out
triangle
she
put
this
bit
into
the
saucepan
and
the
child
looking
at
the
piece
that
was
left
called
out
more
loudly
than
before
and
now
it
is
a
trapezium
the
father
a
working
man
who
was
present
was
much
impressed
with
the
incident
he
went
straight
to
look
for
the
teacher
and
asked
for
an
explanation
much
moved
he
said
if
i
had
been
educated
in
that
way
i
should
not
be
now
just
an
ordinary
workman
it
was
he
who
later
on
arranged
for
a
demonstration
to
induce
all
the
workmen
of
the
dwellings
to
take
an
interest
in
the
school
they
ended
by
presenting
the
teacher
with
a
parchment
they
had
painted
themselves
and
on
it
between
the
pictures
of
little
children
they
had
introduced
every
kind
of
geometrical
form
as
regards
the
touching
of
objects
for
the
realization
of
their
form
there
is
an
infinite
field
of
discovery
open
to
the
child
in
his
environment
children
have
been
seen
to
stand
opposite
a
beautiful
pillar
or
a
statue
and
after
having
admired
it
to
close
their
eyes
in
a
state
of
beatitude
and
pass
their
hands
many
times
over
the
forms
one
of
our
teachers
met
one
day
in
a
church
two
little
brothers
from
the
school
in
via
guisti
they
were
standing
looking
at
the
small
columns
supporting
the
altar
little
by
little
the
elder
boy
edged
nearer
the
columns
and
began
to
touch
them
then
as
if
he
desired
his
little
brother
to
share
his
pleasure
he
drew
him
nearer
and
taking
his
hand
very
gently
made
him
pass
it
round
the
smooth
and
beautiful
shape
of
the
column
but
a
sacristan
came
up
at
that
moment
and
sent
away
those
tiresome
children
who
were
touching
everything
the
great
pleasure
which
the
children
derive
from
the
recognition
of
by
touching
their
form
corresponds
in
itself
to
a
sensory
exercise
many
psychologists
have
spoken
of
the
sense
that
is
the
capacity
of
recognizing
forms
by
the
movement
of
the
muscles
of
the
hand
as
it
follows
the
outlines
of
solid
objects
this
sense
does
not
consist
only
of
the
sense
of
touch
because
the
tactile
sensation
is
only
that
by
which
we
perceive
the
differences
in
quality
of
surfaces
rough
or
smooth
perception
of
form
comes
from
the
combination
of
two
sensations
tactile
and
muscular
muscular
sensations
being
sensations
of
movement
what
we
call
in
the
blind
the
sense
is
in
reality
more
often
the
stereognostic
sense
that
is
they
perceive
by
means
of
their
hands
the
of
it
is
the
special
muscular
sensibility
of
the
child
from
three
to
six
years
of
age
who
is
forming
his
own
muscular
activity
which
stimulates
him
to
use
the
stereognostic
sense
when
the
child
spontaneously
blindfolds
his
eyes
in
order
to
recognize
various
objects
such
as
the
plane
and
solid
insets
he
is
exercising
this
sense
there
are
many
exercises
which
he
can
do
to
enable
him
to
recognize
with
closed
eyes
objects
of
well
defined
shapes
as
for
example
the
little
bricks
and
cubes
of
froebel
marbles
coins
beans
peas
etc
from
a
selection
of
different
objects
mixed
together
he
can
pick
out
those
that
are
alike
and
arrange
them
in
separate
heaps
in
the
didactic
material
there
are
also
geometrical
solids
pale
blue
in
color
a
sphere
a
prism
a
pyramid
a
cone
a
cylinder
the
most
attractive
way
of
teaching
a
child
to
recognize
these
forms
is
for
him
to
touch
them
with
closed
eyes
and
guess
their
names
the
latter
learned
in
a
way
which
i
will
describe
later
after
an
exercise
of
this
kind
the
child
when
his
eyes
are
open
observes
the
forms
with
a
much
more
lively
interest
another
way
of
interesting
him
in
the
solid
geometrical
forms
is
to
make
them
the
sphere
rolls
in
every
direction
the
cylinder
rolls
in
one
direction
only
the
cone
rolls
round
itself
the
prism
and
the
pyramid
however
stand
still
but
the
prism
falls
over
more
easily
than
the
pyramid
illustration
fig
sound
boxes
little
more
remains
of
the
didactic
material
for
the
education
of
the
senses
there
is
however
a
series
of
six
cardboard
cylinders
either
closed
entirely
or
with
wooden
covers
fig
when
these
cases
are
shaken
they
produce
sounds
varying
in
intensity
from
loud
to
almost
imperceptible
sounds
according
to
the
nature
of
the
objects
inside
the
cylinder
there
is
a
double
act
of
these
and
the
exercise
consists
first
in
the
recognition
of
sounds
of
equal
intensity
arranging
the
cylinders
in
pairs
the
next
exercise
consists
in
the
comparison
of
one
sound
with
another
that
is
the
child
arranges
the
six
cylinders
in
a
series
according
to
the
loudness
of
sound
which
they
produce
the
exercise
is
analogous
to
that
with
the
color
spools
which
also
are
paired
and
then
arranged
in
gradation
in
this
case
also
the
child
performs
the
exercise
seated
comfortably
at
a
table
after
a
preliminary
explanation
from
the
teacher
he
repeats
the
exercise
by
himself
his
eyes
being
blindfolded
that
he
may
better
concentrate
his
attention
we
may
conclude
with
a
general
rule
for
the
direction
of
the
education
of
the
senses
the
order
of
procedure
should
be
recognition
of
the
pairing
of
similar
objects
and
the
insertion
of
solid
forms
into
places
which
fit
them
recognition
of
the
presentation
of
the
extremes
of
a
series
of
objects
discrimination
between
objects
very
to
one
another
to
concentrate
the
attention
of
the
child
upon
the
sensory
stimulus
which
is
acting
upon
him
at
a
particular
moment
it
is
well
as
far
as
possible
to
the
sense
for
instance
to
obtain
silence
in
the
room
for
all
the
exercises
and
to
blindfold
the
eyes
for
those
particular
exercises
which
do
not
relate
to
the
education
of
the
sense
of
sight
the
cinematograph
pictures
give
a
general
idea
of
all
the
sense
exercises
which
the
children
can
do
with
the
material
and
any
one
who
has
been
initiated
into
the
theory
on
which
these
are
based
will
be
able
gradually
to
recognize
them
as
they
are
seen
practically
carried
out
it
is
very
advisable
for
those
who
wish
to
guide
the
children
in
these
sensory
exercises
to
begin
themselves
by
working
with
the
didactic
material
the
experience
will
give
them
some
idea
of
what
the
children
must
feel
of
the
difficulties
which
they
must
overcome
and
up
to
a
certain
point
it
will
give
them
some
conception
of
the
interest
which
these
exercises
can
arouse
in
them
whoever
makes
such
experiments
himself
will
be
most
struck
by
the
fact
that
when
blindfolded
he
finds
that
all
the
sensations
of
touch
and
hearing
really
appear
more
acute
and
more
easily
recognized
on
account
of
this
alone
no
small
interest
will
be
aroused
in
the
experimenter
for
the
beginning
of
the
education
of
the
musical
sense
we
use
in
rome
a
material
which
does
not
form
part
of
the
didactic
apparatus
as
it
is
sold
at
present
it
consists
of
a
double
series
of
bells
forming
an
octave
with
tones
and
semitones
these
metal
bells
which
stand
upon
a
wooden
rectangular

are
all

this
exercise
fascinates
children
from
five
years

upwards
if
the
objects
which
have
been
described
constitute
the
didactic
material
for
the
beginnings
of
a
methodical
education
of
the
auditory
sense
i
have
no
desire
to
limit
to
them
an
educational
process
which
is
so
important
and
already
so
complex
in
its
practise
whether
in
the
long
established
methods
of
treatment
for
the
deaf
or
in
modern
physiological
musical
education
in
fact
i
also
use
resonant
metal
tubes
small
bars
of
wood
which
emit
musical
notes
and
strings
little
harps
upon
which
the
children
seek
to
recognize
the
tones
they
have
already
learned
with
the
exercise
of
the
bells
the
pianoforte
may
also
be
used
for
the
same
purpose
in
this
way
the
difference
in
comes
to
be
perceived
together
with
the
differences
in
tone
at
the
same
time
various
exercises
already
mentioned
such
as
the
marches
played
on
the
piano
for
rhythmic
exercises
and
the
simple
songs
sung
by
the
children
themselves
offer
extensive
means
for
the
development
of
the
musical
sense
to
quicken
the
child
attention
in
special
relation
to
sounds
there
is
a
most
important
exercise
which
contrary
to
all
attempts
made
up
to
this
time
in
the
practise
of
education
consists
not
in
producing
but
in
eliminating
as
far
as
possible
all
sounds
from
the
environment
my
lesson
of
silence
has
been
very
widely
applied
even
in
schools
where
the
rest
of
my
method
has
not
found
its
way
for
the
sake
of
its
practical
effect
upon
the
discipline
of
the
children
the
children
are
taught
not
to
move
to
inhibit
all
those
motor
impulses
which
may
arise
from
any
cause
whatsoever
and
in
order
to
induce
in
them
real
immobility
it
is
necessary
to
initiate
them
in
the
of
all
their
movements
the
teacher
then
does
not
limit
herself
to
saying
sit
still
but
she
gives
them
the
example
herself
showing
them
how
to
sit
absolutely
still
that
is
with
feet
still
body
still
arms
still
head
still
the
respiratory
movements
should
also
be
performed
in
such
a
way
as
to
produce
no
sound
the
children
must
be
taught
how
to
succeed
in
this
exercise
the
fundamental
condition
is
that
of
finding
a
comfortable
position
a
position
of
equilibrium
as
they
are
seated
for
this
exercise
they
must
therefore
make
themselves
comfortable
either
in
their
little
chairs
or
on
the
ground
when
immobility
is
obtained
the
room
is
or
else
the
children
close
their
eyes
or
cover
them
with
their
hands
it
is
quite
plain
to
see
that
the
children
take
a
great
interest
in
the
silence
they
seem
to
give
themselves
up
to
a
kind
of
spell
they
might
be
said
to
be
wrapped
in
meditation
little
by
little
as
each
child
watching
himself
becomes
more
and
more
still
the
silence
deepens
till
it
becomes
absolute
and
can
be
felt
just
as
the
twilight
gradually
deepens
whilst
the
sun
is
setting
then
it
is
that
slight
sounds
unnoticed
before
are
heard
the
ticking
of
the
clock
the
chirp
of
a
sparrow
in
the
garden
the
flight
of
a
butterfly
the
world
becomes
full
of
imperceptible
sounds
which
invade
that
deep
silence
without
disturbing
it
just
as
the
stars
shine
out
in
the
dark
sky
without
banishing
the
darkness
of
the
night
it
is
almost
the
discovery
of
a
new
world
where
there
is
rest
it
is
as
it
were
the
twilight
of
the
world
of
loud
noises
and
of
the
uproar
that
oppresses
the
spirit
at
such
a
time
the
spirit
is
set
free
and
opens
out
like
the
corolla
of
the
convolvulus
and
leaving
metaphor
for
the
reality
of
facts
can
we
not
all
recall
feelings
that
have
possessed
us
at
sunset
when
all
the
vivid
impressions
of
the
day
the
brightness
and
clamor
are
silenced
it
is
not
that
we
miss
the
day
but
that
our
spirit
expands
it
becomes
more
sensitive
to
the
inner
play
of
emotions
strong
and
persistent
or
changeful
and
serene
it
was
that
hour
when
mariners
feel
longing
and
hearts
grow
tender
dante
trans
longfellow
the
lesson
of
silence
ends
with
a
general
calling
of
the
names
the
teacher
or
one
of
the
children
takes
her
place
behind
the
class
or
in
an
adjoining
room
and
calls
the
motionless
children
one
by
one
by
name
the
call
is
made
in
a
whisper
that
is
without
vocal
sound
this
demands
a
close
attention
on
the
part
of
the
child
if
he
is
to
hear
his
name
when
his
name
is
called
he
must
rise
and
find
his
way
to
the
voice
which
called
him
his
movements
must
be
light
and
vigilant
and
so
controlled
to
make
no
when
the
children
have
become
acquainted
with
their
hearing
is
in
a
manner
refined
for
the
perception
of
sounds
those
sounds
which
are
too
loud
become
gradually
displeasing
to
the
ear
of
one
who
has
known
the
pleasure
of
silence
and
has
discovered
the
world
of
delicate
sounds
from
this
point
the
children
gradually
go
on
to
perfect
themselves
they
walk
lightly
take
care
not
to
knock
against
the
furniture
move
their
chairs
without
noise
and
place
things
upon
the
table
with
great
care
the
result
of
this
is
seen
in
the
grace
of
carriage
and
of
movement
which
is
especially
delightful
on
account
of
the
way
in
which
it
has
been
brought
about
it
is
not
a
grace
taught
externally
for
the
sake
of
beauty
or
regard
for
the
world
but
one
which
is
born
of
the
pleasure
felt
by
the
spirit
in
immobility
and
silence
the
soul
of
the
child
wishes
to
free
itself
from
the
irksomeness
of
sounds
that
are
too
loud
from
obstacles
to
its
peace
during
work
these
children
with
the
grace
of
pages
to
a
noble
lord
are
serving
their
spirits
this
exercise
develops
very
definitely
the
social
spirit
no
other
lesson
no
other
situation
could
do
the
same
a
profound
silence
can
be
obtained
even
when
more
than
fifty
children
are
crowded
together
in
a
small
space
provided
that
the
children
know
how
to
keep
still
and
want
to
do
it
but
one
disturber
is
enough
to
take
away
the
charm
here
is
demonstration
of
the
cooperation
of
all
the
members
of
a
community
to
achieve
a
common
end
the
children
gradually
show
increased
power
of
many
of
them
rather
than
disturb
the
silence
refrain
from
brushing
a
fly
off
the
nose
or
suppress
a
cough
or
sneeze
the
same
exhibition
of
collective
action
is
seen
in
the
care
with
which
the
children
move
to
avoid
making
a
noise
during
their
work
the
lightness
with
which
they
run
on
tiptoe
the
grace
with
which
they
shut
a
cupboard
or
lay
an
object
on
the
table
these
are
qualities
that
must
be
by
if
the
environment
is
to
become
tranquil
and
free
from
disturbance
one
rebel
is
sufficient
to
mar
this
achievement
one
noisy
child
walking
on
his
heels
or
banging
the
door
can
disturb
the
peaceful
atmosphere
of
the
small
community
language
and
knowledge
of
the
world
the
special
importance
of
the
sense
of
hearing
comes
from
the
fact
that
it
is
the
sense
organ
connected
with
speech
therefore
to
train
the
child
attention
to
follow
sounds
and
noises
which
are
produced
in
the
environment
to
recognize
them
and
to
discriminate
between
them
is
to
prepare
his
attention
to
follow
more
accurately
the
sounds
of
articulate
language
the
teacher
must
be
careful
to
pronounce
clearly
and
completely
the
sounds
of
the
word
when
she
speaks
to
a
child
even
though
she
may
be
speaking
in
a
low
voice
almost
as
if
telling
him
a
secret
the
children
songs
are
also
a
good
means
for
obtaining
exact
pronunciation
the
teacher
when
she
teaches
them
pronounces
slowly
separating
the
component
sounds
of
the
word
pronounced
but
a
special
opportunity
for
training
in
clear
and
exact
speech
occurs
when
the
lessons
are
given
in
the
nomenclature
relating
to
the
sensory
exercises
in
every
exercise
when
the
child
has
the
differences
between
the
qualities
of
the
objects
the
teacher
fixes
the
idea
of
this
quality
with
a
word
thus
when
the
child
has
many
times
built
and
rebuilt
the
tower
of
the
pink
cubes
at
an
opportune
moment
the
teacher
draws
near
him
and
taking
the
two
extreme
cubes
the
largest
and
the
smallest
and
showing
them
to
him
says
this
is
large
this
is
small
the
two
words
only
and
are
pronounced
several
times
in
succession
with
strong
emphasis
and
with
a
very
clear
pronunciation
this
is
large
large
after
which
there
is
a
moment
pause
then
the
teacher
to
see
if
the
child
has
understood
verifies
with
the
following
tests
give
me
the
large
one
give
me
the
one
again
the
large
one
now
the
small
one
give
me
the
large
one
then
there
is
another
pause
finally
the
teacher
pointing
to
the
objects
in
turn
asks
what
is
this
the
child
if
he
has
learned
replies
rightly
large
small
the
teacher
then
urges
the
child
to
repeat
the
words
always
more
clearly
and
as
accurately
as
possible
what
is
it
large
what
large
tell
me
nicely
what
is
it
large
and
objects
are
those
which
differ
only
in
size
and
not
in
form
that
is
all
three
dimensions
change
more
or
less
proportionally
we
should
say
that
a
house
is
large
and
a
hut
is
small
when
two
pictures
represent
the
same
objects
in
different
dimensions
one
can
be
said
to
be
an
enlargement
of
the
other
when
however
only
the
dimensions
referring
to
the
section
of
the
object
change
while
the
length
remains
the
same
the
objects
are
respectively
thick
and
thin
we
should
say
of
two
posts
of
equal
height
but
different
that
one
is
thick
and
the
other
is
thin
the
teacher
therefore
gives
a
lesson
on
the
brown
prisms
similar
to
that
with
the
cubes
in
the
three
periods
which
i
have
described
this
is
thick
this
is
thin
give
me
the
give
me
the
the
pronunciation
of
the
what
is
this
there
is
a
way
of
helping
the
child
to
recognize
differences
in
dimension
and
to
place
the
objects
in
correct
gradation
after
the
lesson
which
i
have
described
the
teacher
scatters
the
brown
prisms
for
instance
on
a
carpet
says
to
the
child
give
me
the
thickest
of
all
and
lays
the
object
on
a
table
then
again
she
invites
the
child
to
look
for
piece
among
those
scattered
on
the
floor
and
every
time
the
piece
chosen
is
laid
in
its
order
on
the
table
next
to
the
piece
previously
chosen
in
this
way
the
child
accustoms
himself
always
to
look
either
for
the
or
the
among
the
rest
and
so
has
a
guide
to
help
him
to
lay
the
pieces
in
gradation
when
there
is
one
dimension
only
which
varies
as
in
the
case
of
the
rods
the
objects
are
said
to
be
long
and
short
the
varying
dimension
being
length
when
the
varying
dimension
is
height
the
objects
are
said
to
be
tall
and
short
when
the
breadth
varies
they
are
broad
and
narrow
of
these
three
varieties
we
offer
the
child
as
a
fundamental
lesson
only
that
in
which
the
varies
and
we
teach
the
differences
by
means
of
the
usual
three
periods
and
by
asking
him
to
select
from
the
pile
at
one
time
always
the
longest
at
another
always
the
shortest
the
child
in
this
way
acquires
great
accuracy
in
the
use
of
words
one
day
the
teacher
had
ruled
the
blackboard
with
very
fine
lines
a
child
said
what
small
lines
they
are
not
small
corrected
another
they
are
when
the
names
to
be
taught
are
those
of
colors
or
of
forms
so
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
emphasize
contrast
between
extremes
the
teacher
can
give
more
than
two
names
at
the
same
time
as
for
instance
this
is
red
this
is
blue
this
is
yellow
or
again
this
is
a
square
this
is
a
triangle
this
is
a
circle
in
the
case
of
a
however
the
teacher
will
select
if
she
is
teaching
the
colors
the
two
extremes
dark
and
light
then
making
choice
always
of
the
darkest
and
the
lightest
many
of
the
lessons
here
described
can
be
seen
in
the
cinematograph
pictures
lessons
on
touching
the
plane
insets
and
the
surfaces
in
walking
on
the
line
in
color
memory
in
the
nomenclature
relating
to
the
cubes
and
the
long
rods
in
the
composition
of
words
reading
writing
etc
by
means
of
these
lessons
the
child
comes
to
know
many
words
very
thoroughly
large
small
thick
thin
long
short
dark
light
rough
smooth
heavy
light
hot
cold
and
the
names
of
many
colors
and
geometrical
forms
such
words
do
not
relate
to
any
particular
but
to
a
psychic
acquisition
on
the
part
of
the
child
in
fact
the
name
is
given
a
long
in
which
the
child
concentrating
his
attention
on
different
qualities
of
objects
has
made
comparisons
reasoned
and
formed
judgments
until
he
has
acquired
a
power
of
discrimination
which
he
did
not
possess
before
in
a
word
he
has
his
his
observation
of
things
has
been
thorough
and
fundamental
he
has
he
finds
himself
therefore
facing
the
world
with
qualities
refined
and
quickened
his
powers
of
observation
and
of
recognition
have
greatly
increased
further
the
mental
images
which
he
has
succeeded
in
establishing
are
not
a
confused
medley
they
are
all
classified
forms
are
distinct
from
dimensions
and
dimensions
are
classed
according
to
the
qualities
which
result
from
the
combinations
of
varying
dimensions
all
these
are
quite
distinct
from
colors
are
divided
according
to
tint
and
to
richness
of
tone
silence
is
distinct
from
noises
from
sounds
and
everything
has
its
own
exact
and
appropriate
name
the
child
then
has
not
only
developed
in
himself
special
qualities
of
observation
and
of
judgment
but
the
objects
which
he
observes
may
be
said
to
go
into
their
place
according
to
the
order
established
in
his
mind
and
they
are
placed
under
their
appropriate
name
in
an
exact
classification
does
not
the
student
of
the
experimental
sciences
prepare
himself
in
the
same
way
to
observe
the
outside
world
he
may
find
himself
like
the
uneducated
man
in
the
midst
of
the
most
diverse
natural
objects
but
he
differs
from
the
uneducated
man
in
that
he
has
for
observation
if
he
is
a
worker
with
the
microscope
his
eyes
are
trained
to
see
in
the
range
of
the
microscope
certain
minute
details
which
the
ordinary
man
can
not
distinguish
if
he
is
an
astronomer
he
will
look
through
the
same
telescope
as
the
curious
visitor
or
but
he
will
see
much
more
clearly
the
same
plants
surround
the
botanist
and
the
ordinary
wayfarer
but
the
botanist
sees
in
every
plant
those
qualities
which
are
classified
in
his
mind
and
assigns
to
each
plant
its
own
place
in
the
natural
orders
giving
it
its
exact
name
it
is
this
capacity
for
recognizing
a
plant
in
a
complex
order
of
classification
which
distinguishes
the
botanist
from
the
ordinary
gardener
and
it
is
and
scientific
language
which
characterizes
the
trained
observer
now
the
scientist
who
has
developed
special
qualities
of
observation
and
who
possesses
an
order
in
which
to
classify
external
objects
will
be
the
man
to
make
scientific
it
will
never
be
he
who
without
preparation
and
order
wanders
dreaming
among
plants
or
beneath
the
starlit
sky
in
fact
our
little
ones
have
the
impression
of
continually
making
discoveries
in
the
world
about
them
and
in
this
they
find
the
greatest
joy
they
take
from
the
world
a
knowledge
which
is
ordered
and
inspires
them
with
enthusiasm
into
their
minds
there
enters
the
creation
instead
of
the
chaos
and
it
seems
that
their
souls
find
therein
a
divine
exultation
freedom
the
success
of
these
results
is
closely
connected
with
the
delicate
intervention
of
the
one
who
guides
the
children
in
their
development
it
is
necessary
for
the
teacher
to
the
child
without
letting
him
feel
her
presence
too
much
so
that
she
may
be
always
ready
to
supply
the
desired
help
but
may
never
be
the
obstacle
between
the
child
and
his
experience
a
lesson
in
the
ordinary
use
of
the
word
cools
the
child
enthusiasm
for
the
knowledge
of
things
just
as
it
would
cool
the
enthusiasm
of
adults
to
keep
alive
that
enthusiasm
is
the
secret
of
real
guidance
and
it
will
not
prove
a
difficult
task
provided
that
the
attitude
towards
the
child
acts
be
that
of
respect
calm
and
waiting
and
provided
that
he
be
left
free
in
his
movements
and
in
his
experiences
then
we
shall
notice
that
the
child
has
a
personality
which
he
is
seeking
to
expand
he
has
initiative
he
chooses
his
own
work
persists
in
it
changes
it
according
to
his
inner
needs
he
does
not
shirk
effort
he
rather
goes
in
search
of
it
and
with
great
joy
overcomes
obstacles
within
his
capacity
he
is
sociable
to
the
extent
of
wanting
to
share
with
every
one
his
successes
his
discoveries
and
his
little
triumphs
there
is
therefore
no
need
of
intervention
wait
while
observing
that
is
the
motto
for
the
educator
let
us
wait
and
be
always
ready
to
share
in
both
the
joys
and
the
difficulties
which
the
child
experiences
he
himself
invites
our
sympathy
and
we
should
respond
fully
and
gladly
let
us
have
endless
patience
with
his
slow
progress
and
show
enthusiasm
and
gladness
at
his
successes
if
we
could
say
we
are
respectful
and
courteous
in
our
dealings
with
children
we
treat
them
as
we
should
like
to
be
treated
ourselves
we
should
certainly
have
mastered
a
great
educational
principle
and
undoubtedly
be
setting
an
of
good
what
we
all
desire
for
ourselves
namely
not
to
be
disturbed
in
our
work
not
to
find
hindrances
to
our
efforts
to
have
good
friends
ready
to
help
us
in
times
of
need
to
see
them
rejoice
with
us
to
be
on
terms
of
equality
with
them
to
be
able
to
confide
and
trust
in
them
this
is
what
we
need
for
happy
companionship
in
the
same
way
children
are
human
beings
to
whom
respect
is
due
superior
to
us
by
reason
of
their
innocence
and
of
the
greater
possibilities
of
their
future
what
we
desire
they
desire
also
as
a
rule
however
we
do
not
respect
our
children
we
try
to
force
them
to
follow
us
without
regard
to
their
special
needs
we
are
overbearing
with
them
and
above
all
rude
and
then
we
expect
them
to
be
submissive
and
knowing
all
the
time
how
strong
is
their
instinct
of
imitation
and
how
touching
their
faith
in
and
admiration
of
us
they
will
imitate
us
in
any
case
let
us
treat
them
therefore
with
all
the
kindness
which
we
would
wish
to
help
to
develop
in
them
and
by
kindness
is
not
meant
caresses
should
we
not
call
anyone
who
embraced
us
at
the
first
time
of
meeting
rude
vulgar
and
kindness
consists
in
interpreting
the
wishes
of
others
in
conforming
one
self
to
them
and
sacrificing
if
need
be
own
desire
this
is
the
kindness
which
we
must
show
towards
children
to
find
the
interpretation
of
children
desires
we
must
study
them
scientifically
for
their
desires
are
often
unconscious
they
are
the
inner
cry
of
life
which
wishes
to
unfold
according
to
mysterious
laws
we
know
very
little
of
the
way
in
which
it
unfolds
certainly
the
child
is
growing
into
a
man
by
force
of
a
divine
action
similar
to
that
by
which
from
nothing
he
became
a
child
our
intervention
in
this
marvelous
process
is
we
are
here
to
offer
to
this
life
which
came
into
the
world
by
itself
the
necessary
for
its
development
and
having
done
that
we
must
await
this
development
with
respect
let
us
leave
the
life
to
develop
within
the
limits
of
the
good
and
let
us
observe
this
inner
life
developing
this
is
the
whole
of
our
mission
perhaps
as
we
watch
we
shall
be
reminded
of
the
words
of
him
who
was
absolutely
good
suffer
the
little
children
to
come
unto
me
that
is
to
say
do
not
hinder
them
from
coming
since
if
they
are
left
free
and
unhampered
they
will
come
writing
the
child
who
has
completed
all
the
exercises
above
described
and
is
thus
for
an
advance
towards
unexpected
conquests
is
about
four
years
old
he
is
not
an
unknown
quantity
as
are
children
who
have
been
left
to
gain
varied
and
casual
experiences
by
themselves
and
who
therefore
differ
in
type
and
intellectual
standard
not
only
according
to
their
natures
but
especially
according
to
the
chances
and
opportunities
they
have
found
for
their
spontaneous
inner
formation
education
has
an
for
the
children
individual
differences
to
be
found
in
them
can
therefore
be
put
down
almost
exclusively
to
each
one
individual
nature
owing
to
their
environment
which
offers
adapted
and
measured
to
meet
the
needs
of
their
psychical
development
our
children
have
acquired
a
fundamental
type
which
is
common
to
all
they
have
their
movements
in
various
kinds
of
manual
work
about
the
house
and
so
have
acquired
a
characteristic
independence
of
action
and
initiative
in
the
adaptation
of
their
actions
to
their
environment
out
of
all
this
emerges
a
for
the
children
have
become
little
men
who
are
the
special
attention
necessary
to
handle
small
fragile
objects
without
breaking
them
and
to
move
heavy
articles
without
making
a
noise
has
endowed
the
movements
of
the
whole
body
with
a
lightness
and
grace
which
are
characteristic
of
our
children
it
is
a
deep
feeling
of
responsibility
which
has
brought
them
to
such
a
pitch
of
perfection
for
instance
when
they
carry
three
or
four
tumblers
at
a
time
or
a
tureen
of
hot
soup
they
know
that
they
are
responsible
not
only
for
the
objects
but
also
for
the
success
of
the
meal
which
at
that
moment
they
are
directing
in
the
same
way
each
child
feels
the
responsibility
of
the
silence
of
the
prevention
of
harsh
sounds
and
he
knows
how
to
cooperate
for
the
general
good
in
keeping
the
environment
not
only
orderly
but
quiet
and
calm
indeed
our
children
have
taken
the
road
which
leads
them
to
mastery
of
themselves
but
their
formation
is
due
to
a
deeper
psychological
work
still
arising
from
the
education
of
the
senses
in
addition
to
ordering
their
environment
and
ordering
themselves
in
their
outward
personalities
they
have
also
ordered
the
inner
world
of
their
minds
the
didactic
material
in
fact
does
not
offer
to
the
child
the
content
of
the
mind
but
the
for
that
content
it
causes
him
to
distinguish
identities
from
differences
extreme
differences
from
fine
gradations
and
to
classify
under
conceptions
of
quality
and
of
quantity
the
most
varying
sensations
appertaining
to
surfaces
colors
dimensions
forms
and
sounds
the
mind
has
formed
itself
by
a
special
exercise
of
attention
observing
comparing
and
classifying
the
mental
attitude
acquired
by
such
an
exercise
leads
the
child
to
make
ordered
observations
in
his
environment
observations
which
prove
as
interesting
to
him
as
discoveries
and
so
stimulate
him
to
multiply
them
indefinitely
and
to
form
in
his
mind
a
rich
content
of
clear
ideas
language
now
comes
to
by
means
of
the
ideas
which
the
mind
has
acquired
these
words
are
few
in
number
and
have
reference
not
to
separate
objects
but
rather
to
the
of
the
which
have
been
formed
in
the
mind
in
this
way
the
children
are
able
to
find
themselves
alike
in
the
world
of
natural
things
and
in
the
world
of
objects
and
of
words
which
surround
them
for
they
have
an
inner
guide
which
leads
them
to
become
and
intelligent
instead
of
wandering
wayfarers
in
an
unknown
land
these
are
the
children
who
in
a
short
space
of
time
sometimes
in
a
few
days
learn
to
write
and
to
perform
the
first
operations
of
arithmetic
it
is
not
a
fact
that
children
in
general
can
do
it
as
many
have
believed
it
is
not
a
case
of
giving
my
material
for
writing
to
unprepared
children
and
of
awaiting
the
miracle
the
fact
is
that
the
minds
and
hands
of
our
children
are
already
for
writing
and
ideas
of
quantity
of
identity
of
differences
and
of
gradation
which
form
the
bases
of
all
calculation
have
been
maturing
for
a
long
time
in
them
one
might
say
that
all
their
previous
education
is
a
preparation
for
the
first
stages
of
essential
culture
and
that
knowledge
comes
as
an
easy
spontaneous
and
logical
consequence
of
the
preparation
that
it
is
in
fact
its
natural
we
have
already
seen
that
the
purpose
of
the
is
to
fix
ideas
and
to
facilitate
the
elementary
comprehension
of
in
the
same
way
writing
and
arithmetic
now
fix
the
complex
inner
acquisitions
of
the
mind
which
proceeds
henceforward
continually
to
enrich
itself
by
fresh
observations
our
children
have
long
been
preparing
the
hand
for
writing
throughout
all
the
sensory
exercises
the
hand
whilst
cooperating
with
the
mind
in
its
attainments
and
in
its
work
of
formation
was
preparing
its
own
future
when
the
hand
learned
to
hold
itself
lightly
suspended
over
a
horizontal
surface
in
order
to
touch
rough
and
smooth
when
it
took
the
cylinders
of
the
solid
insets
and
placed
them
in
their
apertures
when
with
two
fingers
it
touched
the
outlines
of
the
geometrical
forms
it
was
coordinating
movements
and
the
child
is
now
ready
almost
impatient
to
use
them
in
the
fascinating
synthesis
of
writing
the
preparation
for
writing
also
consists
in
exercises
of
the
movements
of
the
hand
there
are
two
series
of
exercises
very
different
from
one
another
i
have
analyzed
the
movements
which
are
connected
with
writing
and
i
prepare
them
separately
one
from
the
other
when
we
write
we
perform
a
movement
for
the
of
the
instrument
of
writing
a
movement
which
generally
acquires
an
individual
character
so
that
a
person
handwriting
can
be
recognized
and
in
certain
medical
cases
changes
in
the
nervous
system
can
be
traced
by
the
corresponding
alterations
in
the
handwriting
in
fact
it
is
from
the
handwriting
that
specialists
in
that
subject
would
interpret
the
of
individuals
writing
has
besides
this
a
general
character
which
has
reference
to
the
form
of
the
alphabetical
signs
when
a
man
writes
he
combines
these
two
parts
but
they
actually
exist
as
the
parts
of
a
single
and
can
be
prepared
apart
for
the
management
of
the
instrument
of
the
individual
part
in
the
didactic
material
there
are
two
sloping
wooden
boards
on
each
of
which
stand
five
square
metal
frames
colored
pink
in
each
of
these
is
inserted
a
blue
geometrical
figure
similar
to
the
geometrical
insets
and
provided
with
a
small
button
for
a
handle
with
this
material
we
use
a
box
of
ten
colored
pencils
and
a
little
book
of
designs
which
i
have
prepared
after
five
years
experience
of
observing
the
children
i
have
chosen
and
graduated
the
designs
according
to
the
use
which
the
children
made
of
them
the
two
sloping
boards
are
set
side
by
side
and
on
them
are
placed
ten
complete
insets
that
is
to
say
the
frames
with
the
geometrical
figures
fig
the
child
is
given
a
sheet
of
white
paper
and
the
box
of
ten
colored
pencils
he
will
then
choose
one
of
the
ten
metal
insets
which
are
arranged
in
an
attractive
line
at
a
certain
distance
from
him
the
child
is
taught
the
following
process
illustration
fig
sloping
boards
to
display
set
of
metal
insets
he
lays
the
frame
of
the
iron
inset
on
the
sheet
of
paper
and
holding
it
down
firmly
with
one
hand
he
follows
with
a
colored
pencil
the
interior
outline
which
describes
a
geometrical
figure
then
he
lifts
the
square
frame
and
finds
drawn
upon
the
paper
an
enclosed
geometrical
form
a
triangle
a
circle
a
hexagon
etc
the
child
has
not
actually
performed
a
new
exercise
because
he
had
already
performed
all
these
movements
when
he
the
wooden
plane
insets
the
only
new
feature
of
the
exercise
is
that
he
follows
the
outlines
no
longer
directly
with
his
finger
but
through
the
medium
of
a
pencil
that
is
he
he
leaves
a
of
his
movement
the
child
finds
this
exercise
easy
and
most
interesting
and
as
soon
as
he
has
succeeded
in
making
the
first
outline
he
places
above
it
the
piece
of
blue
metal
corresponding
to
it
this
is
an
exercise
exactly
similar
to
that
which
he
performed
when
he
placed
the
wooden
geometrical
figures
upon
the
cards
of
the
third
series
where
the
figures
are
only
contained
by
a
simple
line
this
time
however
when
the
action
of
placing
the
form
upon
the
outline
is
performed
the
child
takes
colored
and
draws
the
outline
of
the
blue
metal
figure
when
he
raises
it
if
the
drawing
is
well
done
he
finds
upon
the
paper
a
geometrical
figure
contained
by
two
outlines
in
colors
and
if
the
colors
have
been
well
chosen
the
result
is
very
attractive
and
the
child
who
has
already
had
a
considerable
education
of
the
chromatic
sense
is
keenly
interested
in
it
these
may
seem
unnecessary
details
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
are
for
instance
if
instead
of
arranging
the
ten
metal
insets
in
a
row
the
teacher
distributes
them
among
the
children
without
thus
exhibiting
them
the
child
exercises
are
much
limited
when
on
the
other
hand
the
insets
are
exhibited
before
his
eyes
he
feels
the
desire
to
draw
them
one
after
the
other
and
the
number
of
exercises
is
increased
the
two
rouse
the
desire
of
the
child
to
see
another
combination
of
colors
and
then
to
repeat
the
experience
the
variety
of
the
objects
and
the
colors
are
therefore
an
to
work
and
hence
to
final
success
here
the
actual
preparatory
movement
for
writing
begins
when
the
child
has
drawn
the
figure
in
double
outline
he
takes
hold
of
a
pencil
like
a
pen
for
writing
and
draws
marks
up
and
down
until
he
has
completely
filled
the
figure
in
this
way
a
definite
figure
remains
on
the
paper
similar
to
the
figures
on
the
cards
of
the
first
series
this
figure
can
be
in
any
of
the
ten
colors
at
first
the
children
fill
in
the
figures
very
clumsily
without
regard
for
the
outlines
making
very
heavy
lines
and
not
keeping
them
parallel
little
by
little
however
the
drawings
improve
in
that
they
keep
within
the
outlines
and
the
lines
increase
in
number
grow
finer
and
are
parallel
to
one
another
when
the
child
has
begun
these
exercises
he
is
seized
with
a
desire
to
continue
them
and
he
never
tires
of
drawing
the
outlines
of
the
figures
and
then
filling
them
in
each
child
suddenly
becomes
the
possessor
of
a
considerable
number
of
drawings
and
he
treasures
them
up
in
his
own
little
drawer
in
this
way
he
the
movement
of
writing
which
brings
him
the
management
of
the
this
movement
in
ordinary
methods
is
represented
by
the
wearisome
pothook
connected
with
the
first
laborious
and
tedious
attempts
at
writing
the
organization
of
this
movement
which
began
from
the
guidance
of
a
piece
of
metal
is
as
yet
rough
and
imperfect
and
the
child
now
passes
on
to
the
in
of
the
prepared
in
the
little
album
the
leaves
are
taken
from
the
book
one
by
one
in
the
order
of
progression
in
which
they
are
arranged
and
the
child
fills
in
the
prepared
designs
with
colored
pencils
in
the
same
way
as
before
here
the
choice
of
the
colors
is
another
intelligent
occupation
which
encourages
the
child
to
multiply
the
tasks
he
chooses
the
colors
by
himself
and
with
much
taste
the
delicacy
of
the
shades
which
he
chooses
and
the
harmony
with
which
he
arranges
them
in
these
designs
show
us
that
the
common
belief
that
children
love
and
colors
has
been
the
result
of
observation
of
without
who
have
been
abandoned
to
the
rough
and
harsh
experiences
of
an
environment
unfitted
for
them
the
education
of
the
chromatic
sense
becomes
at
this
point
of
a
child
development
the
which
enables
him
to
become
possessed
of
a
firm
bold
and
beautiful
handwriting
the
drawings
lend
themselves
to
in
very
many
ways
length
of
the
strokes
with
which
they
are
filled
the
child
will
have
to
fill
in
geometrical
figures
both
large
and
small
of
a
pavement
design
or
flowers
and
leaves
or
the
various
details
of
an
animal
or
of
a
landscape
in
this
way
the
hand
accustoms
itself
not
only
to
perform
the
general
action
but
also
to
confine
the
movement
within
all
kinds
of
limits
hence
the
child
is
preparing
himself
to
write
in
a
handwriting
large
or
small
indeed
later
on
he
will
write
as
well
between
the
wide
lines
on
a
blackboard
as
between
the
narrow
closely
ruled
lines
of
an
exercise
book
generally
used
by
much
older
children
the
number
of
exercises
which
the
child
performs
with
the
drawings
is
practically
unlimited
he
will
often
take
another
colored
pencil
and
draw
over
again
the
outlines
of
the
figure
already
filled
in
with
color
a
help
to
the
of
the
exercise
is
to
be
found
in
the
further
education
of
the
chromatic
sense
which
the
child
acquires
by
painting
the
same
designs
in
later
he
mixes
colors
for
himself
until
he
can
imitate
the
colors
of
nature
or
create
the
delicate
tints
which
his
own
imagination
desires
it
is
not
possible
however
to
speak
of
all
this
in
detail
within
the
limits
of
this
small
work
for
the
writing
of
alphabetical
illustration
fig
single
sandpaper
letter
illustration
fig
groups
of
sandpaper
letters
in
the
didactic
material
there
are
series
of
boxes
which
contain
the
alphabetical
signs
at
this
point
we
take
those
cards
which
are
covered
with
very
smooth
paper
to
which
is
gummed
a
letter
of
the
alphabet
cut
out
in
sandpaper
fig
there
are
also
large
cards
on
which
are
gummed
several
letters
grouped
together
according
to
analogy
of
form
fig
the
children
have
to
over
the
alphabetical
signs
as
though
they
were
writing
they
touch
them
with
the
tips
of
the
index
and
middle
fingers
in
the
same
way
as
when
they
touched
the
wooden
insets
and
with
the
hand
raised
as
when
they
lightly
touched
the
rough
and
smooth
surfaces
the
teacher
herself
touches
the
letters
to
show
the
child
how
the
movement
should
be
performed
and
the
child
if
he
has
had
much
practise
in
touching
the
wooden
insets
her
with
and
pleasure
without
the
previous
practise
however
the
child
hand
does
not
follow
the
letter
with
accuracy
and
it
is
most
interesting
to
make
close
observations
of
the
children
in
order
to
understand
the
importance
of
a
motor
for
writing
and
also
to
realize
the
strain
which
we
impose
upon
the
children
when
we
set
them
to
write
directly
without
a
previous
motor
education
of
the
hand
the
child
finds
great
pleasure
in
touching
the
sandpaper
letters
it
is
an
exercise
by
which
he
applies
to
a
new
attainment
the
power
he
has
already
acquired
through
exercising
the
sense
of
touch
whilst
the
child
touches
a
letter
the
teacher
pronounces
its
sound
and
she
uses
for
the
lesson
the
usual
three
periods
thus
for
example
presenting
the
two
vowels
she
will
have
the
child
touch
them
slowly
and
accurately
and
repeat
their
relative
sounds
one
after
the
other
as
the
child
touches
them
i
i
i
o
o
o
then
she
will
say
to
the
child
give
me
i
give
me
o
finally
she
will
ask
the
question
what
is
this
to
which
the
child
replies
i
o
she
proceeds
in
the
same
way
through
all
the
other
letters
giving
in
the
case
of
the
consonants
not
the
name
but
only
the
sound
the
child
then
touches
the
letters
by
himself
over
and
over
again
either
on
the
separate
cards
or
on
the
large
cards
on
which
several
letters
are
gummed
and
in
this
way
he
establishes
the
movements
necessary
for
tracing
the
alphabetical
signs
at
the
same
time
he
retains
the
image
of
the
letter
this
process
forms
the
first
preparation
not
only
for
writing
but
also
for
reading
because
it
is
evident
that
when
the
child
the
letters
he
performs
the
movement
corresponding
to
the
writing
of
them
and
at
the
same
time
when
he
recognizes
them
by
sight
he
is
reading
the
alphabet
the
child
has
thus
prepared
in
effect
all
the
necessary
movements
for
writing
therefore
he
this
important
conquest
is
the
result
of
a
long
period
of
inner
formation
of
which
the
child
is
not
clearly
aware
but
a
day
will
come
very
soon
when
he
and
that
will
be
a
day
of
great
surprise
for
him
the
wonderful
harvest
of
an
unknown
sowing

letters
the
alphabet
of
movable
letters
cut
out
in
pink
and
blue
cardboard
and
kept
in
a
special
box
with
compartments
serves
for
the
composition
of
words
fig
in
a
phonetic
language
like
italian
it
is
enough
to
pronounce
clearly
the
different
component
sounds
of
a
word
as
for
example
so
that
the
child
whose
ear
is
may
recognize
one
by
one
the
component
sounds
then
he
looks
in
the
movable
alphabet
for
the
corresponding
to
each
separate
sound
and
lays
them
one
beside
the
other
thus
composing
the

gradually
he
will
become
able

do
the

thing
with
words
of
which
he
thinks
himself
he
succeeds
in
breaking
them
up
into
their
component
sounds
and
in
translating
them
into
a
row
of
signs
when
the
child
has
composed
the
words
in
this
way
he
knows
how
to
read
them
in
this
method
therefore
all
the
processes
leading
to
writing
include
reading
as
well
if
the
language
is
not
phonetic
the
teacher
can
compose
separate
words
with
the
movable
alphabet
and
then
pronounce
them
letting
the
child
repeat
by
himself
the
exercise
of
arranging
and
rereading
them
in
the
material
there
are
two
movable
alphabets
one
of
them
consists
of
larger
letters
and
is
divided
into
two
boxes
each
of
which
contains
the
vowels
this
is
used
for
the
first
exercises
in
which
the
child
needs
very
large
objects
in
order
to
recognize
the
letters
when
he
is
acquainted
with
one
half
of
the
consonants
he
can
begin
to
compose
words
even
though
he
is
dealing
with
one
part
only
of
the
alphabet
the
other
movable
alphabet
has
smaller
letters
and
is
contained
in
a
single
box
it
is
given
to
children
who
have
made
their
first
attempts
at
composition
with
words
and
already
know
the
complete
alphabet
it
is
after
these
exercises
with
the
movable
alphabet
that
the
child
able
to
write
entire
this
phenomenon
generally
occurs
unexpectedly
and
then
a
child
who
has
never
yet
traced
a
stroke
or
a
letter
on
paper
several
words
in
from
that
moment
he
continues
to
write
always
gradually
perfecting
himself
this
spontaneous
writing
takes
on
the
characteristics
of
a
phenomenon
and
the
child
who
has
begun
to
write
the
first
word
will
continue
to
write
in
the
same
way
as
he
spoke
after
pronouncing
the
first
word
and
as
he
walked
after
having
taken
the
first
step
the
same
course
of
inner
formation
through
which
the
phenomenon
of
writing
appeared
is
the
course
of
his
future
progress
of
his
growth
to
perfection
the
child
prepared
in
this
way
has
entered
upon
a
course
of
development
through
which
he
will
pass
as
surely
as
the
growth
of
the
body
and
the
development
of
the
natural
functions
have
passed
through
their
course
of
development
when
life
has
once
been
established
for
the
interesting
and
very
complex
phenomena
relating
to
the
development
of
writing
and
then
of
reading

a
a
the
single
staff
is
used
in
the
conservatoire
of
milan
and
utilized
in
the
perlasca
method
when
the
child
knows
how
to
read
he
can
make
a
first
application
of
this
knowledge
to
the
reading
of
the
names
of
musical
notes
in
connection
with
the
material
for
sensory
education
consisting
of
the
series
of
bells
we
use
a
didactic
material
which
serves
as
an
introduction
to
musical
reading
for
this
purpose
we
have
in
the
first
place
a
wooden
board
not
very
long
and
painted
pale
green
on
this
board
the
staff
is
cut
out
in
black
and
in
every
line
and
space
are
cut
round
holes
inside
each
of
which
is
written
the
name
of
the
note
in
its
reference
to
the
treble
clef
there
is
also
a
series
of
little
white
discs
which
can
be
fitted
into
the
holes
on
one
side
of
each
disc
is
written
the
name
of
the
note
doh
re
mi
fah
soh

the
child
guided
by
the
name
written
on
the
discs
puts
them
with
the
name
uppermost
in
their
right
places
on
the
board
and
then
reads
the
names
of
the
notes
this
exercise
he
can
do
by
himself
and
he
learns
the
position
of
each
note
on
the
staff
another
exercise
which
the
child
can
do
at
the
same
time
is
to
place
the
disc
bearing
the
name
of
the
note
on
the
rectangular
base
of
the
corresponding
bell
whose
sound
he
has
already
learned
to
recognize
by
ear
in
the
sensorial
exercise
described

following
this
exercise
there
is
another
staff
made
on
a
board
of
green
wood
which
is
longer
than
the
other
and
has
neither
indentures
nor
signs
a
considerable
number
of
discs
on
one
side
of
which
are
written
the
names
of
the
notes
is
at
the
disposal
of
the
child
he
takes
up
a
disc
at
random
reads
its
name
and
places
it
on
the
staff
with
the
name
underneath
so
that
the
white
face
of
the
disc
shows
on
the
top
by
the
repetition
of
this
exercise
the
child
is
enabled
to
arrange
many
discs
on
the
same
line
or
in
the
same
space
when
he
has
finished
he
turns
them
all
over
so
that
the
names
are
outside
and
so
finds
out
if
he
has
made
mistakes
after
learning
the
treble
clef
the
child
passes
on
to
learn
the
bass
with
great
ease
to
the
staff
described
above
can
be
added
another
similar
to
it
arranged
as
is
shown
in
the
figure

is
reached

by
forming
with
his
two
lines
of

has
completed

with
which
the

is
already
acquainted
for
a
first
practical
application
of
this

we
have
used
in
our
schools
a
miniature
pianoforte

which
reproduces
the
essentials
of
this
instrument
although
in
a
simplified
form
and
so
that
they
are
visible
two
octaves
only
are
reproduced

the
keys
which
are
small
are
proportioned
to
the
hand
of
a
little
child

five
years

the
hammers
are
black
and
white
like
the
notes
with
this
instrument
it
is
very
easy
for
the
child
to
practise
alone
finding
the
notes
on
the
keyboard
corresponding
to
some
bar
of
written
music
and
following
the
movements
of
the
fingers
made
in
playing
the
piano
the
keyboard
in
itself
is
mute
but
a
series
of
resonant
tubes
resembling
a
set
of
can
be
applied
to
the
upper
surface
so
that
the
hammers
striking
these
produce
musical
notes
corresponding
to
the

can
then
pursue
his
exercises

the
instinctive
knowledge
necessary
as
a
preparation
for
clear
ideas

the
conception

of

formed
part

the
senses
which
began
with
the
recognition
of
identical
objects
and
continued
with
the
arrangement
in
gradation
of
similar
objects
i
will
make
a
special
illustration
of
the
first
exercise
with
the
solid
insets
which
can
be
done
even
by
a
child
of
two
and
a
half
when
he
makes
a
mistake
by
putting
a
cylinder
in
a
hole
too
large
for
it
and
so
leaves
cylinder
without
a
place
he
instinctively
absorbs
the
idea
of
the
absence
of
from
a
continuous
series
the
mind
is
not
prepared
for
number
by
certain
preliminary
ideas
given
in
haste
by
the
teacher
but
has
been
prepared
for
it
by
a
process
of
formation
by
a
slow
building
up
of
itself
to
enter
directly
upon
the
teaching
of
arithmetic
we
must
turn
to
the
same
didactic
material
used
for
the
education
of
the
senses
let
us
look
at
the
three
sets
of
material
which
are
presented
after
the
exercises
with
the
solid
insets
the
material
for
teaching
the
pink
cubes
the
brown
prisms
and
the
green
rods
there
is
a
definite
relation
between
the
ten
pieces
of
each
series
in
the
material
for
length
the
shortest
piece
is
a
of
for
all
the
rest
the
second
piece
is
double
the
first
the
third
is
three
times
the
first
and
whilst
the
scale
of
length
increases
by
ten
centimeters
for
each
piece
the
other
dimensions
remain
constant
the
rods
all
have
the
same
section
the
pieces
then
stand
in
the
same
relation
to
one
another
as
the
natural
series
of
the
numbers
in
the
second
series
namely
that
which
shows
whilst
the
length
remains
constant
the
square
section
of
the
prisms
varies
the
result
is
that
the
sides
of
the
square
sections
vary
according
to
the
series
of
natural
numbers
in
the
first
prism
the
square
of
the
section
has
sides
of
one
centimeter
in
the
second
of
two
centimeters
in
the
third
of
three
centimeters
and
so
on
until
the
tenth
in
which
the
square
of
the
section
has
sides
of
ten
centimeters
the
prisms
therefore
are
in
the
same
proportion
to
one
another
as
the
numbers
of
the
series
of
squares
etc
for
it
would
take
four
prisms
of
the
first
size
to
make
the
second
nine
to
make
the
third
etc
the
pieces
which
make
up
the
series
for
teaching
thickness
are
therefore
in
the
following
proportion
in
the
case
of
the
pink
cubes
the
edge
increases
according
to
the
numerical
series
the
first
cube
has
an
edge
of
one
centimeter
the
second
of
two
centimeters
the
third
of
three
centimeters
and
so
on
to
the
tenth
cube
which
has
an
edge
of
ten
centimeters
hence
the
relation
in
volume
between
them
is
that
of
the
cubes
of
the
series
of
numbers
from
one
to
ten
in
fact
to
make
up
the
volume
of
the
second
pink
cube
eight
of
the
first
little
cubes
would
be
required
to
make
up
the
volume
of
the
third
would
be
required
and
so
on
illustration
a
b
fig
diagram
illustrating
use
of
numerical
rods
the
children
have
an
intuitive
knowledge
of
this
difference
for
they
realize
that
the
exercise
with
the
pink
cubes
is
the
of
all
three
and
that
with
the
rods
the
most
difficult
when
we
begin
the
direct
teaching
of
number
we
choose
the
long
rods
modifying
them
however
by
dividing
them
into
ten
spaces
each
ten
centimeters
in
length
colored
alternately
red
and
blue
for
example
the
rod
which
is
four
times
as
long
as
the
first
is
clearly
seen
to
be
composed
of
four
equal
lengths
red
and
blue
and
similarly
with
all
the
rest
when
the
rods
have
been
placed
in
order
of
gradation
we
teach
the
child
the
numbers
one
two
three
by
touching
the
rods
in
succession
from
the
first
up
to
ten
then
to
help
him
to
gain
a
clear
idea
of
number
we
proceed
to
the
recognition
of
separate
rods
by
means
of
the
customary
lesson
in
three
periods
we
lay
the
three
first
rods
in
front
of
the
child
and
pointing
to
them
or
taking
them
in
the
hand
in
turn
in
order
to
show
them
to
him
we
say
this
is
this
is
this
is
we
point
out
with
the
finger
the
divisions
in
each
rod
counting
them
so
as
to
make
sure
one
two
this
is
one
two
three
this
is
then
we
say
to
the
child
give
me
give
me
give
me
finally
pointing
to
a
rod
we
say
what
is
this
the
child
answers
three
and
we
count
together
one
two
three
in
the
same
way
we
teach
all
the
other
rods
in
their
order
adding
always
one
or
two
more
according
to
the
responsiveness
of
the
child
the
importance
of
this
didactic
material
is
that
it
gives
a
clear
idea
of
for
when
a
number
is
named
it
exists
as
an
object
a
unity
in
itself
when
we
say
that
a
man
possesses
a
million
we
mean
that
he
has
a
which
is
worth
so
many
units
of
measure
of
values
and
these
units
all
belong
to
one
person
so
if
we
add
to
we
add
a
to
a
and
these
numbers
for
a
reason
represent
in
themselves
groups
of
homogeneous
units
again
when
the
child
shows
us
the
he
is
handling
a
rod
which
is
inflexible
an
object
complete
in
itself
yet
composed
of
equal
which
can
be
counted
and
when
he
comes
to
add
to
he
will
place
next
to
one
another
two
rods
two
objects
one
of
which
has
eight
equal
lengths
and
the
other
two
when
on
the
other
hand
in
ordinary
schools
to
make
the
calculation
easier
they
present
the
child
with
different
objects
to
count
such
as
beans
marbles
and
when
to
take
the
case
i
have
quoted
he
takes
a
group
of
eight
marbles
and
adds
two
more
marbles
to
it
the
natural
impression
in
his
mind
is
not
that
he
has
added
to
but
that
he
has
added
to
the
result
is
not
so
clear
and
the
child
is
required
to
make
the
effort
of
holding
in
his
mind
the
idea
of
a
group
of
eight
objects
as
united
corresponding
to
a
single
number
this
effort
often
puts
the
child
back
and
delays
his
understanding
of
number
by
months
or
even
years
the
addition
and
subtraction
of
numbers
under
ten
are
made
very
much
simpler
by
the
use
of
the
didactic
material
for
teaching
lengths
let
the
child
be
presented
with
the
attractive
problem
of
arranging
the
pieces
in
such
a
way
as
to
have
a
set
of
rods
all
as
long
as
the
longest
he
first
arranges
the
rods
in
their
right
order
the
long
stair
he
then
takes
the
last
rod
and
lays
it
next
to
the
similarly
he
takes
the
last
rod
but
one
and
lays
it
next
to
the
and
so
on
up
to
the
this
very
simple
game
represents
the
addition
of
numbers
within
the
ten
then
when
he
puts
the
rods
back
in
their
places
he
must
first
take
away
the
and
put
it
back
under
the
and
then
take
away
in
their
turn
the
the
the
by
this
action
he
has
put
the
rods
back
again
in
their
right
gradation
but
he
has
also
performed
a
series
of
arithmetical
subtractions
the
teaching
of
the
actual
figures
marks
an
advance
from
the
rods
to
the
process
of
counting
with
separate
units
when
the
figures
are
known
they
will
serve
the
very
purpose
in
the
abstract
which
the
rods
serve
in
the
concrete
that
is
they
will
stand
for
the
into
one
of
a
certain
number
of
separate
units
the
function
of
language
and
the
wide
field
of
work
which
it
opens
out
for
the
intelligence
is
we
might
say
by
the
function
of
the
which
now
can
be
substituted
for
the
concrete
rods
the
use
of
the
actual
rods
only
would
limit
arithmetic
to
the
small
operations
within
the
ten
or
numbers
a
little
higher
and
in
the
construction
of
the
mind
these
operations
would
advance
very
little
farther
than
the
limits
of
the
first
simple
and
elementary
education
of
the
senses
the
figure
which
is
a
word
a
graphic
sign
will
permit
of
that
unlimited
progress
which
the
mathematical
mind
of
man
has
been
able
to
make
in
the
course
of
its
evolution
in
the
material
there
is
a
box
containing
smooth
cards
on
which
are
gummed
the
figures
from
one
to
nine
cut
out
in
sandpaper
these
are
analogous
to
the
cards
on
which
are
gummed
the
sandpaper
letters
of
the
alphabet
the
method
of
teaching
is
always
the
same
the
child
is
to
the
figures
in
the
direction
in
which
they
are
written
and
to
name
them
at
the
same
time
in
this
case
he
does
more
than
when
he
learned
the
letters
he
is
shown
how
to
place
each
figure
upon
the
corresponding
rod
when
all
the
figures
have
been
learned
in
this
way
one
of
the
first
exercises
will
be
to
place
the
number
cards
upon
the
rods
arranged
in
gradation
so
arranged
they
form
a
succession
of
steps
on
which
it
is
a
pleasure
to
place
the
cards
and
the
children
remain
for
a
long
time
repeating
this
intelligent
game
after
this
exercise
comes
what
we
may
call
the
emancipation
of
the
child
he
carried
his
own
figures
with
him
and
now
he
will
know
how
to
group
units
together
illustration
fig
counting
boxes
for
this
purpose
we
have
in
the
didactic
material
a
series
of
wooden
pegs
but
in
addition
to
these
we
give
the
children
all
sorts
of
small
objects
sticks
tiny
cubes
counters
etc
the
exercise
will
consist
in
placing
opposite
a
figure
the
number
of
objects
that
it
indicates
the
child
for
this
purpose
can
use
the
box
which
is
included
in
the
material
fig
this
box
is
divided
into
compartments
above
each
of
which
is
printed
a
figure
and
the
child
places
in
the
compartment
the
corresponding
number
of
pegs
another
exercise
is
to
lay
all
the
figures
on
the
table
and
place
below
them
the
corresponding
number
of
cubes
counters
etc
this
is
only
the
first
step
and
it
would
be
impossible
here
to
speak
of
the
succeeding
lessons
in
zero
in
tens
and
in
other
arithmetical
processes
for
the
development
of
which
my
larger
works
must
be
consulted
the
didactic
material
itself
however
can
give
some
idea
in
the
box
containing
the
pegs
there
is
one
compartment
over
which
the
is
printed
inside
this
compartment
nothing
must
be
put
and
then
we
begin
with
zero
is
nothing
but
it
is
placed
next
to
one
to
enable
us
to
count
when
we
pass
beyond

we
were
to
take

could

material
there
are

containing

at

place

and
figure
over
the
zero
in
the
frame
and
so
on
up
to
to
advance
farther
we
should
need
to
use
two
rods
of
to
make
the
children
show
much
enthusiasm
when
learning
these
exercises
which
demand
from
them
two
sets
of
activities
and
give
them
in
their
work
clearness
of
idea
in
writing
and
arithmetic
we
have
gathered
the
fruits
of
a
laborious
education
which
consisted
in
coordinating
the
movements
and
gaining
a
first
knowledge
of
the
world
this
culture
comes
as
a
natural
consequence
of
man
first
efforts
to
put
himself
into
intelligent
communication
with
the
world
all
those
early
acquisitions
which
have
brought
order
into
the
mind
would
be
wasted
were
they
not
firmly
established
by
means
of
written
language
and
of
figures
thus
established
however
these
experiences
open
up
an
unlimited
field
for
future
education
what
we
have
done
therefore
is
to
introduce
the
child
to
a
higher
level
the
level
of
culture
and
he
will
now
be
able
to
pass
on
to
a
but
not
the
school
we
know
where
irrationally
we
try
to
give
culture
to
minds
not
yet
prepared
or
to
receive
to
preserve
the
health
of
their
minds
which
have
been
and
not
by
the
order
of
the
work
our
children
must
have
a
new
kind
of
school
for
the
acquisition
of
culture
my
experiments
in
the
continuation
of
this
method
for
older
children
are
already
far
advanced
moral
factors
a
brief
description
such
as
this
of
the
which
are
used
in
the
children
house
may
perhaps
give
the
reader
the
impression
of
a
logical
and
convincing
system
of
education
but
the
importance
of
my
method
does
not
lie
in
the
organization
itself
but
the
effects
which
it
produces
on
the
it
is
the
who
proves
the
value
of
this
method
by
his
spontaneous
manifestations
which
seem
to
reveal
the
laws
of
man
inner
development
b
psychology
will
perhaps
find
in
the
children
houses
a
laboratory
which
will
bring
more
truths
to
light
than
thus
hitherto
recognized
for
the
essential
factor
in
psychological
research
especially
in
the
field
of
psychogenesis
the
origin
and
development
of
the
mind
must
be
the
establishment
of
normal
conditions
for
the
free
development
of
thought
b
see
the
chapters
on
discipline
in
my
larger
works
as
is
well
known
we
leave
the
children
in
their
work
and
in
all
actions
which
are
not
of
a
disturbing
kind
that
is
we
disorder
which
is
bad
but
allow
to
that
which
is
orderly
and
good
the
most
complete
liberty
of
manifestation
the
results
obtained
are
surprising
for
the
children
have
shown
a
love
of
work
which
no
one
suspected
to
be
in
them
and
a
calm
and
an
orderliness
in
their
movements
which
surpassing
the
limits
of
correctness
have
entered
into
those
of
grace
the
spontaneous
discipline
and
the
obedience
which
is
seen
in
the
whole
class
constitute
the
most
striking
result
of
our
method
the
ancient
philosophical
discussion
as
to
whether
man
is
born
good
or
evil
is
often
brought
forward
in
connection
with
my
method
and
many
who
have
supported
it
have
done
so
on
the
ground
that
it
provides
a
demonstration
of
man
natural
goodness
very
many
others
on
the
contrary
have
opposed
it
considering
that
to
leave
children
free
is
a
dangerous
mistake
since
they
have
in
them
innate
tendencies
to
evil
i
should
like
to
put
the
question
upon
a
more
positive
plane
in
the
words
good
and
evil
we
include
the
most
varying
ideas
and
we
confuse
them
especially
our
practical
dealings
with
little
the
tendencies
which
we
stigmatize
as
in
little
children
of
three
to
six
years
of
age
are
often
merely
those
which
cause
to
us
adults
when
not
understanding
their
needs
we
try
to
prevent
their
their
every
to
gain
experience
for
themselves
in
the
by
touching
everything
the
child
however
through
this
is
led
to
his
and
to
collect
impressions
especially
sensations
of
touch
so
that
when
prevented
he
and
this
rebellion
forms
almost
the
whole
of
his
naughtiness
what
wonder
is
it
that
the
evil
disappears
when
if
we
give
the
right
for
development
and
leave
full
liberty
to
use
them
rebellion
has
no
more
reason
for
existence
further
by
the
substitution
of
a
series
of
outbursts
of
for
the
old
series
of
outbursts
of
the
moral
physiognomy
of
the
child
comes
to
assume
a
calm
and
gentleness
which
make
him
appear
a
different
being
it
is
we
who
provoked
the
children
to
the
violent
manifestations
of
a
real
for
in
order
to
exist
to
the
needs
of
their
psychic
they
were
often
obliged
to
snatch
from
us
the
things
which
seemed
necessary
to
them
for
the
purpose
they
had
to
move
contrary
to
our
laws
or
sometimes
to
struggle
with
other
children
to
wrest
from
them
the
objects
of
their
desire
on
the
other
hand
if
we
give
children
the
of
the
struggle
for
it
disappears
and
a
vigorous
expansion
of
life
takes
its
place
this
question
involves
a
hygienic
principle
connected
with
the
nervous
system
during
the
difficult
period
when
the
brain
is
still
rapidly
growing
and
should
be
of
great
interest
to
specialists
in
children
diseases
and
nervous
derangements
the
inner
life
of
man
and
the
beginnings
of
his
intellect
are
controlled
by
special
laws
and
vital
necessities
which
can
not
be
forgotten
if
we
are
aiming
at
health
for
mankind
for
this
reason
an
educational
method
which
cultivates
and
protects
the
inner
activities
of
the
child
is
not
a
question
which
concerns
merely
the
school
or
the
teachers
it
is
a
universal
question
which
concerns
the
family
and
is
of
vital
interest
to
mothers
to
go
more
deeply
into
a
question
is
often
the
only
means
of
answering
it
rightly
if
for
instance
we
were
to
see
men
fighting
over
a
piece
of
bread
we
might
say
how
bad
men
are
if
on
the
other
hand
we
entered
a
and
saw
them
quietly
finding
a
place
and
choosing
their
meal
without
any
envy
of
one
another
we
might
say
how
good
men
are
evidently
the
question
of
absolute
good
and
evil
intuitive
ideas
of
which
guide
us
in
our
superficial
judgment
goes
beyond
such
limitations
as
these
we
can
for
instance
provide
excellent
for
an
entire
people
without
directly
affecting
the
question
of
their
morals
one
might
say
indeed
that
to
judge
by
appearances
a
people
are
quieter
and
commit
less
than
a
nation
that
is
but
whoever
draws
from
that
the
conclusion
that
to
make
men
good
it
is
to
feed
them
will
be
making
an
obvious
mistake
it
can
not
be
denied
however
that
will
be
an
essential
factor
in
obtaining
goodness
in
the
sense
that
it
will
all
the
acts
and
the
caused
by
lack
of
bread
now
in
our
case
we
are
dealing
with
a
far
deeper
need
the
nourishment
of
man
inner
life
and
of
his
higher
functions
the
bread
that
we
are
dealing
with
is
the
bread
of
the
spirit
and
we
are
entering
into
the
difficult
subject
of
the
satisfaction
of
psychic
needs
we
have
already
obtained
a
most
interesting
result
in
that
we
have
found
it
possible
to
present
of
enabling
children
to
reach
a
higher
level
of
calm
and
goodness
and
we
have
been
able
to
establish
these
means
by
experience
the
whole
foundation
of
our
results
rests
upon
these
means
which
we
have
discovered
and
which
may
be
divided
under
two
heads
the
of
and
liberty
it
is
the
perfect
organization
of
work
permitting
the
possibility
of
and
giving
outlet
for
the
energies
which
procures
for
each
child
the
beneficial
and
calming
and
it
is
under
such
conditions
of
work
that
liberty
leads
to
a
perfecting
of
the
activities
and
to
the
attainment
of
a
fine
discipline
which
is
in
itself
the
result
of
that
new
quality
of
that
has
been
developed
in
the
child
freedom
without
organization
of
work
would
be
useless
the
child
left
without
means
of
work
would
go
to
waste
just
as
a
baby
if
without
nourishment
would
die
of
starvation
organization
of
the
therefore
is
the
of
this
new
structure
of
goodness
but
even
that
organization
would
be
in
vain
without
the
to
make
use
of
it
and
without
freedom
for
the
expansion
of
all
those
energies
which
spring
from
the
satisfaction
of
the
child
highest
activities
has
not
a
similar
phenomenon
occurred
also
in
the
history
of
man
the
history
of
civilization
is
a
history
of
successful
attempts
to
organize
work
and
to
obtain
liberty
on
the
whole
man
goodness
has
also
increased
as
is
shown
by
his
progress
from
barbarism
to
civilization
and
it
may
be
said
that
crime
the
various
forms
of
wickedness
cruelty
and
violence
have
been
gradually
decreasing
during
this
passage
of
time
the
of
our
times
as
a
matter
of
fact
has
been
compared
to
a
form
of
surviving
in
the
midst
of
civilized
peoples
it
is
therefore
through
the
better
organization
of
work
that
society
will
probably
attain
to
a
further
purification
and
in
the
meanwhile
it
seems
unconsciously
to
be
seeking
the
overthrow
of
the
last
barriers
between
itself
and
liberty
if
this
is
what
we
learn
from
society
how
great
should
be
the
results
among
little
children
from
three
to
six
years
of
age
if
the
organization
of
their
work
is
complete
and
their
freedom
absolute
it
is
for
this
reason
that
to
us
they
seem
so
good
like
heralds
of
hope
and
of
redemption
if
men
walking
as
yet
so
painfully
and
imperfectly
along
the
road
of
work
and
of
freedom
have
become
better
why
should
we
fear
that
the
same
road
will
prove
disastrous
to
the
children
yet
on
the
other
hand
i
would
not
say
that
the
goodness
of
our
little
ones
in
their
freedom
will
solve
the
problem
of
the
absolute
goodness
or
wickedness
of
man
we
can
only
say
that
we
have
made
a
contribution
to
the
cause
of
goodness
by
removing
obstacles
which
were
the
cause
of
violence
and
of
rebellion
let
us
render
therefore

things
that
are

unto
