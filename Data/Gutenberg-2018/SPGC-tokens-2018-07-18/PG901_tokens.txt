this
play
composed
by
so
worthy
an
author
as
master
marlowe
and
the
part
of
the
jew
presented
by
so
unimitable
an
actor
as
master
alleyn
being
in
this
later
age
commended
to
the
stage
as
i
ushered
it
unto
the
court
and
presented
it
to
the
with
these
prologues
and
epilogues
here
inserted
so
now
being
newly
brought
to
the
press
i
was
loath
it
should
be
published
without
the
ornament
of
an
epistle
making
choice
of
you
unto
whom
to
devote
it
than
whom
of
all
those
gentlemen
and
acquaintance
within
the
compass
of
my
long
knowledge
there
is
none
more
able
to
tax
ignorance
or
attribute
right
to
merit
sir
you
have
been
pleased
to
grace
some
of
mine
own
works
with
your
courteous
patronage
i
hope
this
will
not
be
the
worse
accepted
because
commended
by
me
over
whom
none
can
claim
more
power
or
privilege
than
yourself
i
had
no
better
a
gift
to
present
you
with
receive
it
therefore
as
a
continuance
of
that
inviolable
obligement
by
which
he
rests
still
engaged
who
as
he
ever
hath
shall
always
remain

heywood
the
prologue
spoken
at
court
gracious
and
great
that
we
so
boldly
dare
other
plays
that
now
in
fashion
are
to
present
this
writ
many
years
agone
and
in
that
age
thought
second
unto
none
we
humbly
crave
your
pardon
we
pursue
the
story
of
a
rich
and
famous
jew
who
liv
in
malta
you
shall
find
him
still
in
all
his
projects
a
sound
machiavill
and
that
his
character
he
that
hath
past
so
many
censures
is
now
come
at
last
to
have
your
princely
ears
grace
you
him
then
you
crown
the
action
and
renown
the
pen
epilogue
spoken
at
court
it
is
our
fear
dread
sovereign
we
have
bin
too
tedious
neither
ca
be
less
than
sin
to
wrong
your
princely
patience
if
we
have
thus
low
dejected
we
your
pardon
crave
and
if
aught
here
offend
your
ear
or
sight
we
only
act
and
speak
what
others
write
the
prologue
to
the
stage
at
the
we
know
not
how
our
play
may
pass
this
stage
but
by
the
best
of
poets
in
that
age
the
had
being
and
was
made
and
he
then
by
the
best
of
actors
play
in
hero
and
leander
one
did
gain
a
lasting
memory
in
tamburlaine
this
jew
with
others
many
th
other
wan
the
attribute
of
peerless
being
a
man
whom
we
may
rank
with
doing
no
one
wrong
proteus
for
shapes
and
roscius
for
a
tongue
so
could
he
speak
so
vary
nor
hate
to
merit
in
him
who
doth
personate
our
jew
this
day
nor
is
it
his
ambition
to
exceed
or
equal
being
of
condition
more
modest
this
is
all
that
he
intends
and
that
too
at
the
urgence
of
some
friends
to
prove
his
best
and
if
none
here
gainsay
it
the
part
he
hath
studied
and
intends
to
play
it
epilogue
to
the
stage
at
the
in
graving
with
pygmalion
to
contend
or
painting
with
apelles
doubtless
the
end
must
be
disgrace
our
actor
did
not
so
he
only
aim
to
go
but
not
nor
think
that
this
day
any
prize
was
play
here
were
no
bets
at
all
no
wagers
laid
all
the
ambition
that
his

to

in

to

the
tragedy
of
a
jew
who
smiles
to

how
full
his
bags
are

which
money
was
not

without

i
barabas
discovered
in
his
with
heaps
of

before
him
barabas
so
that
of
thus
much
that
return
was
made
and
of
the
third
part
of
the
persian
ships
there
was
the
venture
summ
and
satisfied
as
for
those
samnites
and
the
men
of
uz
that
bought
my
spanish
oils
and
wines
of
greece
here
have
i
purs
their
paltry
silverlings
fie
what
a
trouble
is
to
count
this
trash
well
fare
the
arabians
who
so
richly
pay
the
things
they
traffic
for
with
wedge
of
gold
whereof
a
man
may
easily
in
a
day
tell
that
which
may
maintain
him
all
his
life
the
needy
groom
that
never
finger
groat
would
make
a
miracle
of
thus
much
coin
but
he
whose
coffers
are
cramm
full
and
all
his
hath
been
tired
wearying
his
fingers
ends
with
telling
it
would
in
his
age
be
loath
to
labour
so
and
for
a
pound
to
sweat
himself
to
death
give
me
the
merchants
of
the
indian
mines
that
trade
in
metal
of
the
purest
mould
the
wealthy
moor
that
in
the
eastern
rocks
without
control
can
pick
his
riches
up
and
in
his
house
heap
pearl
like
receive
them
free
and
sell
them
by
the
weight
bags
of
fiery
opals
sapphires
amethysts
jacinths
hard
topaz
emeralds
beauteous
rubies
sparkling
diamonds
and
costly
stones
of
so
great
price
as
one
of
them
indifferently
rated
and
of
a
carat
of
this
quantity
may
serve
in
peril
of
calamity
to
ransom
great
kings
from
captivity
this
is
the
ware
wherein
consists
my
wealth
and
thus
methinks
should
men
of
judgment
frame
their
means
of
traffic
from
the
vulgar
trade
and
as
their
wealth
increaseth
so
inclose
infinite
riches
in
a
little
room
but
now
how
stands
the
wind
into
what
corner
peers
my
halcyon
bill
ha
to
the
east
yes
see
how
stand
the
vanes
east
and
by
south
why
then
i
hope
my
ships
i
sent
for
egypt
and
the
bordering
isles
are
gotten
up
by
nilus
winding
banks
mine
argosy
from
alexandria
loaden
with
spice
and
silks
now
under
sail
are
smoothly
gliding
down
by
to
malta
through
our
mediterranean
but
who
comes
here
enter
a
merchant
how
now
merchant
barabas
thy
ships
are
safe
riding
in
and
all
the
merchants
with
other
merchandise
are
safe
arriv
and
have
sent
me
to
know
whether
yourself
will
come
and
custom
them
barabas
the
ships
are
safe
thou
and
richly
fraught
merchant
they
are
barabas
why
then
go
bid
them
come
ashore
and
bring
with
them
their
bills
of
entry
i
hope
our
credit
in
the
will
serve
as
well
as
i
were
present
there
go
send
threescore
camels
thirty
mules
and
twenty
waggons
to
bring
up
the
ware
but
art
thou
master
in
a
ship
of
mine
and
is
thy
credit
not
enough
for
that
merchant
the
very
custom
barely
comes
to
more
than
many
merchants
of
the
town
are
worth
and
therefore
far
exceeds
my
credit
sir
barabas
go
tell
the
jew
of
malta
sent
thee
man
tush
who
amongst
knows
not
barabas
merchant
i
go
barabas
so
then
there
somewhat
sirrah
which
of
my
ships
art
thou
master
of
merchant
of
the
speranza
sir
barabas
and
thou
not
mine
argosy
at
alexandria
thou
couldst
not
come
from
egypt
or
by
caire
but
at
the
entry
there
into
the
sea
where
nilus
pays
his
tribute
to
the
main
thou
needs
must
sail
by
alexandria
merchant
i
neither
saw
them
nor
inquir
of
them
but
this
we
heard
some
of
our
seamen
say
they
wonder
how
you
durst
with
so
much
wealth
trust
such
a
crazed
vessel
and
so
far
barabas
tush
they
are
wise
i
know
her
and
her
strength
but
go
go
thou
thy
ways
discharge
thy
ship
and
bid
my
factor
bring
his
loading
in
exit
merchant
and
yet
i
wonder
at
this
argosy
enter
a
second
merchant
second
merchant
thine
argosy
from
alexandria
know
barabas
doth
ride
in
laden
with
riches
and
exceeding
store
of
persian
silks
of
gold
and
orient
pearl
barabas
how
chance
you
came
not
with
those
other
ships
that
sail
by
egypt
second
merchant
sir
we
saw
not
barabas
belike
they
coasted
round
by
about
their
oils
or
other
businesses
but
was
ill
done
of
you
to
come
so
far
without
the
aid
or
conduct
of
their
ships
second
merchant
sir
we
were
wafted
by
a
spanish
fleet
that
never
left
us
till
within
a
league
that
had
the
galleys
of
the
turk
in
chase
barabas
o
they
were
going
up
to
sicily
well
go
and
bid
the
merchants
and
my
men
despatch
and
come
ashore
and
see
the
fraught
discharg
second
merchant
i
go
exit
barabas
thus
trolls
our
fortune
in
by
land
and
sea
and
thus
are
we
on
every
side
enrich
these
are
the
blessings
promis
to
the
jews
and
herein
was
old
abraham
happiness
what
more
may
heaven
do
for
earthly
man
than
thus
to
pour
out
plenty
in
their
laps
ripping
the
bowels
of
the
earth
for
them
making
the
sea
s
their
servants
and
the
winds
to
drive
their
substance
with
successful
blasts
who
hateth
me
but
for
my
happiness
or
who
is
honour
now
but
for
his
wealth
rather
had
i
a
jew
be
hated
thus
than
pitied
in
a
christian
poverty
for
i
can
see
no
fruits
in
all
their
faith
but
malice
falsehood
and
excessive
pride
which
methinks
fits
not
their
profession
haply
some
hapless
man
hath
conscience
and
for
his
conscience
lives
in
beggary
they
say
we
are
a
scatter
nation
i
can
not
tell
but
we
have
scambled
up
more
wealth
by
far
than
those
that
brag
of
faith

not

alas
our

come
either
by

so
much
for

afflict
us
all
barabas
fond
men
what
dream
you
of
their

treat
of
peace

a
sum

cruel
handling
of

taken
half
our

seven
thousand
sheep
three
thousand
camels
and
two
hundred
yoke
of
labouring
oxen
and
five
hundred
but
for
every
one
of
those
had
they
been
valu
at
indifferent
rate
i
had
at
home
and
in
mine
argosy
and
other
ships
that
came
from
egypt
last
as
much
as
would
have
bought
his
beasts
and
him
and
yet
have
kept
enough
to
live
upon
so
that
not
he
but
i
may
curse
the
day
thy
fatal
forlorn
barabas
and
henceforth
wish
for
an
eternal
night
that
clouds
of
darkness
may
inclose
my
flesh
and
hide
these
extreme
sorrows
from
mine
eyes
for
only
i
have
toil
to
inherit
here
the
months
of
vanity
and
loss
of
time
and
painful
nights
have
been
appointed

second
jew
good
barabas
be
patient
barabas
ay
i
pray
leave
me
in
my
patience
you
that
were
possess
of
wealth
are
pleas
with
want
but
give
him
liberty
at
least
to
mourn
that
in
a
field
amidst
his
enemies
doth
see
his
soldiers
slain
himself
disarm
and
knows
no
means
of
his
recovery
ay
let
me
sorrow
for
this
sudden
chance
is
in
the
trouble
of
my
spirit
i

great
injuries

not
so
soon

his
ireful
mood

words
will
but
increase
his
ecstasy

a
misery
to
see
a
man
in
such
farewell
barabas
barabas
ay

you
well
exeunt
three
jews
see
the
simplicity
of
these
base
slaves
who
for
the
villains
have
no
wit
themselves
think
me
to
be
a
senseless
lump
of
clay
that
will
with
every
water
wash
to
dirt
no
barabas
is
born
to
better
chance
and
fram
of
finer
mould
than
common
men
that
measure
naught
but
by
the
present
time
a
reaching
thought
will
search
his
deepest
wits
and
cast
with
cunning
for
the
time
to
come
for
evils
are
apt
to
happen
every
day
enter
abigail
but
whither
wends
my
beauteous
abigail
o

has
made
my
lovely

sad
what
woman
moan
not
for
a
little
loss
thy
father
has
enough
in
store
for
thee
abigail
nor
for
myself
but
aged
barabas
father
for
thee
lamenteth
abigail
but
i
will
learn
to
leave
these
fruitless
tears
and
urg
thereto
with
my
afflictions
with
fierce
exclaims
run
to
the
and
in
the
senate
reprehend
them
all
and
rent
their
hearts
with
tearing
of
my
hair
till
they
reduce
the
wrongs
done
to
my
father
barabas
no
abigail
things
past
recovery
are
hardly
cur
with
exclamations
be
silent
daughter
sufferance
breeds
ease
and
time
may
yield
us
an
occasion
which
on
the
sudden
can
not
serve
the
turn
besides
my
girl
think
me
not
all
so
fond
as
negligently
to
forgo
so
much
without
provision
for
thyself
and
me
ten
thousand
portagues
besides
great
pearls
rich
costly
jewels
and
stones
infinite
fearing
the
worst
of
this
before
it
fell
i
closely
hid
abigail
where
father
barabas
in
my
house
my
girl
abigail
then
shall
they
be
seen
of
barabas
for

will
give
me
leave
once
more
i
trow
to
go
into
my
house
abigail
that

they
not
for
there
i
left
the
governor
placing
nuns
displacing
me
and
of
thy
house
they
mean
to
make
a
nunnery
where
none
but
their
own
sect
must
enter
in
men
generally
barr
barabas
my
gold
my
gold
and
all
my
wealth
is
gone
you
partial
heavens
have
i
deserv
this
plague
what
will
you
thus
oppose
me
luckless
stars
to
make
me
desperate
in
my
poverty
and
knowing
me
impatient
in
distress
think
me
so
mad
as
i
will
hang
myself
that
i
may
vanish
the
earth
in
air
and
leave
no
memory
that
i
was
no
i
will
live
nor
loathe
i
this
my
life
and
since
you
leave
me
in
the
ocean
thus
to
sink
or
swim
and
put
me
to
my
shifts
i
rouse
my
senses
and
awake
daughter
i
have
it
thou
the
plight
wherein
these
christians
have
oppressed
me
be
rul
by
me
for
in
extremity
we
ought
to
make
bar
of
no
policy

manifestly
wronged

poor

with
fatal

towards
these

the
incertain

have
their
flight

left
me
in
despair
and
of

no

bare

behold
unseen
where
i
have
found
the
gold
the
pearls

jewels
which
he
hid

now
i
remember
those
old
women
words
who
in
my
wealth
would
tell
me
winter
tales
and
speak
of
spirits
and
ghosts
that
glide
by
night
about
the
place
where
treasure
hath
been
hid
and
now
methinks
that
i
am
one
of
those
for
whilst
i
live
here
lives
my
soul
sole
hope
and
when
i
die
here
shall
my
spirit
walk

that
my

were
so
good
as

to
be
about
this
happy
place
is
not
so
happy
yet

said
he
would
attend
me
in
the
morn
then
gentle
sleep
his
body
rests
give
charge
to
morpheus
that
he
may
dream
a
golden
dream
and
of

their
pains
are
wondrous
and
indeed
do
no
man
good
aside
and
seeing
they
are
not
idle
but
still
doing
is
likely
they
in
time
may
reap
some
fruit
i
mean
in
fullness
of
perfection
lodowick
good
barabas
glance
not
at
our
holy

barabas
as
for

i

abroad
o
nights
and

sick
people
groaning
under

sometimes
i
go
about

poison
wells

christian
thieves
i

content
to

some
of
my
crowns
that
i
may
walking
in
my
gallery
see
go
pinion
along
by
my
door
being
young
i
studied
physic
and
began
to
practice
first
upon
the
italian
there
i
enrich
the
priests
with
burials
and
always
kept
the
sexton
arms
in
ure
with
digging
graves
and
ringing
dead
men
knells
and
after
that
was
i
an
engineer
and
in
the
wars
france
and
germany
under
pretence
of
helping
charles
the
fifth
slew
friend
and
enemy
with
my
stratagems
then
after
that
was
i
an
usurer
and
with
extorting
cozening
forfeiting
and
tricks
belonging
unto
brokery
i
fill
the
gaols
with
bankrupts
in
a
year
and
with
young
orphans
planted
hospitals
and
every
moon
made
some
or
other
mad
and
now
and
then
one
hang
himself
for
grief
pinning
upon
his
breast
a
long
great
scroll
how
i
with
interest
tormented
him
but
mark
how
i
am
blest
for
plaguing
them
i
have
as
much
coin
as
will
buy
the
town
but
tell
me
now
how
hast
thou
spent
thy
time
ithamore
faith
master
in
setting
christian
villages
on
fire
chaining
of
eunuchs
binding
one
time
i
was
an
hostler
in
an
inn
and
in
the
secretly
would
i
steal
to
travellers
chambers
and
there
cut
their
throats
once
at
jerusalem
where
the
pilgrims
kneel
i
strewed
powder
on
the
marble
stones
and
therewithal
their
knees
would
rankle
so
that
i
have
laugh
to
see
the
cripples
go
limping
home
to
christendom
on
stilts
barabas
why
this
is
something
make
account
of
me

a
warning
ere

hath
sworn

death
lodowick
my
death
what
is
the
peasant
mad
barabas
no
no
but
happily
he
stands
in
fear
of
that
which
you
i
think
dream
upon
my
daughter
here
a
paltry
silly
girl
lodowick
why
loves
she
don
mathias
barabas
doth
she
not
with
her
smiling
answer
you
abigail
he
has
my
heart
i
smile
against
my
will
aside
lodowick
barabas
thou
i
have
lov
thy
daughter
long
barabas
and
so
has
she
done
you
even
from
a
child
lodowick
and
now
i
can
no
longer
hold
my
mind
barabas
nor
i
the
affection
that
i
bear
to
you
lodowick
this
is
thy
diamond
tell
me
shall
i
have
it
barabas
win
it
and
wear
it
it
is
yet
unsoil
o
but
i
know
your
lordship
would
disdain
to
marry
with
the
daughter
of
a
jew
and
yet
i
give
her
many
a
golden
cross
with
christian
posies
round
about
the
ring
lodowick
is
not
thy
wealth
but
her
that
i
esteem
yet
crave
i
thy
consent
barabas
and
mine
you
have
yet
let
me
talk
to
this
offspring
of
cain
this
jebusite
that
never
tasted
of
the
passover
nor
shall
see
the
land
of
canaan
nor
our
messias
that
is
yet
to
come
this
gentle
maggot
lodowick
i
mean
must
be
deluded
let
him
have
thy
hand
but
keep
thy
heart
till
don
mathias
comes
aside
to
her
abigail
what
shall
i
be
betroth
to
lodowick
barabas
it
no
sin
to
deceive
a
christian
for
they
themselves
hold
it
a
principle
faith
is
not
to
be
held
with
heretics
but
all
are
heretics
that
are
not
jews
this
follows
well
and
therefore
daughter
fear
aside
to
her
i
have
entreated
her
and
she
will
grant
lodowick
then
gentle
abigail
plight
thy
faith
to
me
abigail
i
can
not
choose
seeing
my
father
bids
nothing
but
death
shall
part
my
love

lodowick
now

i
that
for
which
my
soul
hath
long
barabas

why
on
the
sudden
is
your
colour

know
not
but
farewell
i
must
be
gone
barabas

but
let
her
not
speak
one
word
more
lodowick
mute
o
the
sudden
here
a
sudden
change
barabas
o
muse
not
at

is
the
hebrews
guise
that

depart
she
is
thy
wife
and
thou
shalt
be
mine
heir
lodowick

rather
let
the
brightsome
heavens

upon
his
son
nor
on

long
since
that
i
did
labour
thy
admission
and
then
thou
didst
not
like
that
holy
life
abigail
then
were
my
thoughts
so
frail
and
as
i
was
chain
to
follies
of
the
world
but
now
experience
purchased
with
grief
has
made
me
see
the
difference
of
things
my
sinful
soul
alas
hath
pac
too
long
the
fatal
labyrinth
of
misbelief
far
from
the
sun
that
gives
eternal
life
friar
jacomo
who
taught
thee
this
abigail
the
abbess
of
the
house
whose
zealous
admonition
i
embrace
o
therefore
jacomo
let
me
be
one
although
unworthy
of
that
sisterhood
friar
jacomo
abigail
i
will
but
see
thou
change
no
more
for
that
will
be
most
heavy
to
thy
soul
abigail
that
was
my
father
fault
friar
jacomo
thy

how
abigail
nay
you

my
duty
waits
on

of
me
art
thou
again
got
to
the
nunnery
now
here
she
writes
and
wills
me
to
repent
repentance
spurca
what
pretendeth
this
i
fear
she
knows
is
so
of
my
device
in
don
mathias
and
lodovico
deaths
if
so
is
time
that
it
be
seen
into
for
she
that
varies
from
me
in
belief
gives
great
presumption
that
she
loves
me
not
or
loving
doth
dislike
of
something
but
who
comes
here
enter
ithamore
o
ithamore
come
near
come
near
my

near
thy
master
life
my
trusty
servant

my
second
self
for
i
have
now
no
hope
but
even
in
thee
and
on
that
hope
my
happiness
is
built
when
thou
abigail
ithamore
barabas
with
whom
ithamore
a
friar
barabas
a
friar
false
villain
he
hath
done
the
deed
ithamore
how
sir
barabas
why
made
mine
abigail
a
nun
ithamore
that
no
lie
for
she
sent
me
for
him
barabas
o
unhappy
day
false
credulous
inconstant
abigail
but
let
go
and
ithamore
from
hence
shall
she
grieve
me
more
with
her
disgrace
shall
she
live
to
inherit
aught
of
mine
be
bless
of
me
nor
come
within
my
gates
but
perish
underneath
my
bitter
curse
like
cain
by
adam
for
his
brother
death
ithamore
o
master
barabas
ithamore
entreat
not
for
her
i
am
mov
and
she
is
hateful
to
my
soul
and
me
and
thou
yield
to
this
that
i
entreat
i
can
not
think
but
that
thou
my
life
ithamore
who
i
master
why
i
run
to
some
rock
and
throw
myself
headlong
into
the
sea
why
i
do
any
thing
for
your
sweet
sake
barabas
o
trusty
ithamore
no
servant
but
my
friend
i
here
adopt
thee
for
mine
only
heir
all
that
i
have
is
thine
when
i
am
dead
and
whilst
i
live
use
half
spend
as
myself
here
take
my
keys
i
give
thee
anon
go
buy
thee
garments
but
thou
shalt
not
want

i
hold

must
needs
say
that
i
have
been
a
great
usurer
friar

thou
hast
committed
barabas
fornication
but
that
was
in
another
country

friar
barnardine
ay
but
barabas
remember
mathias
and
don
lodowick
barabas
why
what
of
them
friar
barnardine
i
will
not
say
that
by
a
forged
challenge
they
met
barabas
she
has
confess
and
we
are
both
undone
my
bosom
inmate
but
i
must
aside
to
ithamore
o
holy
friars
the
burden
of
my
sins
lie
heavy
on
my
soul
then
pray
you
tell
me
not
too
late
now
to
turn
christian
i
have
been
zealous
in
the
jewish
faith
to
the
poor
a
covetous
wretch
that
would
for
lucre
sake
have
sold
my
soul
a
hundred
for
a
hundred
i
have
and
now
for
store
of
wealth
may
i
compare
with
all
the
jews
in
malta
but
what
is
wealth
i
am
a
jew
and
therefore
am
i
lost
would
penance
serve
to
atone
for
this
my
sin
i
could
afford
to
whip
myself
to
death
ithamore
and
so
could
i
but
penance
will
not
serve
barabas
to
fast
to
pray

for

that
each
particular
be
known
exeunt
enter
bellamira
and
bellamira
didst
thou
meet
with
ithamore
i
did
bellamira
and
didst
thou
deliver
my
letter
i
did
bellamira
and
what
thinkest
thou
will
he
come
i
think
so
and
yet
i
can
not
tell
for
at
the
reading
of
the
letter
he
looked
like
a
man
of
another
world
bellamira
why
so
that
such
a
base
slave
as
he
should
be
saluted
by
such
a
tall
man
as
i
am
from
such
a
beautiful
dame
as
you
bellamira
and
what
said
he
not
a
wise
word
only
gave
me
a
nod
as
who
should
say
is
it
even
so
and
so
i
left
him
being
driven
to
a
at
the
critical
aspect
of
my
terrible
countenance
bellamira
and
where
didst
meet
him
upon
mine
own
within
forty
foot
of
the
gallows
conning
his
i
take
it
looking
of
a
friar
execution
whom
i
saluted
with
an
old
hempen
proverb
hodie
tibi
cras
mihi
and
so
i
left
him
to
the
mercy
of
the
hangman
but
the
exercise
being
done
see
where
he
comes
enter
ithamore
ithamore
i
never
knew
a
man
take
his
death
so
patiently
as
this
friar
he
was
ready
to
leap
off
ere
the
halter
was
about
his
neck
and
when
the
hangman
had
put
on
his
hempen
tippet
he
made
such
haste
to
his
prayers
as
if
he
had
had
another
cure
to
serve
well
go
whither
he
will
i
be
none
of
his
followers
in
haste
and
now
i
think
o
going
to
the
execution
a
fellow
met
me
with
a
muschatoes
like
a
wing
and
a
dagger
with
a
hilt
like
a
and
he
gave
me
a
letter
from
one
madam
bellamira
saluting
me
in
such
sort
as
if
he
had
meant
to
make
clean
my
boots
with
his
lips
the
effect
was
that
i
should
come
to
her
house
i
wonder
what
the
reason
is
it
may
be
she
sees
more
in
me
than
i
can
find
in
myself
for
she
writes
further
that
she
loves
me
ever
since
she
saw
me
and
who
would
not
requite
such
love
here
her
house
and
here
she
comes
and
now
would
i
were
gone
i
am
not
worthy
to
look
upon
her
this
is
the
gentleman

writ
to
ithamore

a
shaggy
tatter
staring
slave

twice

thrice
about

hast
thou
gotten
by
thy

no
simple
place
no
small
authority
i
now
am
governor
of
malta
true
but
malta
hates
me
and
in
hating
me
my
life
in
danger
and
what
boots
it
thee
poor
barabas
to
be
the
governor
whenas
thy
life
shall
be
at
their
command
no
barabas
this
must
be
look
into
and
since
by
wrong
thou
authority
maintain
it
bravely
by
firm
policy
at
least
unprofitably
lose
it
not
for
he
that
liveth
in
authority
and
neither
gets
him
friends
nor
fills
his
bags
lives
like
the
ass
that
aesop
speaketh
of
that
labours
with
a
load
of
bread
and
wine
and
leaves
it
off
to
snap
on
but
barabas
will
be
more
circumspect
begin
betimes
occasion
bald
behind
slip
not
thine
opportunity
for
fear
too
late
thou
for
much
but
canst
not
compass
within
here
enter
ferneze

barabas
since
things
are
in
thy
power
i
see
no
reason
but
of

extreme
cruelty
nor
fear
i
death
nor
will
i
flatter

you
shall
and
as
for

a
place
for

as
once
you
said
within
this
isle
in
malta
here

one
stratagem

making
a
profit
of
my
policy
and
he
from
whom
my
most
advantage
comes
shall
be
my
friend
this
is
the
life
we
jews
are
us
to
lead
and
reason
too
for
christians
do
the
like
well
now
about
effecting
this
device
first
to
surprise
great
selim
soldiers
and
then
to
make
provision
for
the
feast
that
at
one
instant
all
things
may
be
done
my
