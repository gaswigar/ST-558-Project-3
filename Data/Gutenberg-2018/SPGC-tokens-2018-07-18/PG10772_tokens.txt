preface
the
following
pages
represent
some
of
the
results
of
four
journeys
into
the
interior
of
peru
and
also
many
explorations
into
the
labyrinth
of
early
writings
which
treat
of
the
incas
and
their
land
although
my
travels
covered
only
a
part
of
southern
peru
they
took
me
into
every
variety
of
climate
and
forced
me
to
camp
at
almost
every
altitude
at
which
men
have
constructed
houses
or
erected
tents
in
the
western
hemisphere
from
sea
level
up
to
feet
it
has
been
my
lot
to
cross
bleak
andean
passes
where
there
are
heavy
snowfalls
and
low
temperatures
as
well
as
to
wend
my
way
through
gigantic
canyons
into
the
dense
jungles
of
the
amazon
basin
as
hot
and
humid
a
region
as
exists
anywhere
in
the
world
the
incas
lived
in
a
land
of
violent
contrasts
no
deserts
in
the
world
have
less
vegetation
than
those
of
sihuas
and
majes
no
luxuriant
tropical
valleys
have
more
plant
life
than
the
jungles
of
conservidayoc
in
inca
land
one
may
pass
from
glaciers
to
tree
ferns
within
a
few
hours
so
also
in
the
labyrinth
of
contemporary
chronicles
of
the
last
of
the
incas
no
historians
go
more
rapidly
from
fact
to
fancy
from
accurate
observation
to
grotesque
imagination
no
writers
omit
important
details
and
give
conflicting
statements
with
greater
frequency
the
story
of
the
incas
is
still
in
a
maze
of
doubt
and
contradiction
it
was
the
mystery
and
romance
of
some
of
the
wonderful
pictures
of
a
explorer
that
first
led
me
into
the
relatively
unknown
region
between
the
apurimac
and
the
urubamba
sometimes
called
the
cradle
of
the
incas
although
my
photographs
can
not
compete
with
the
imaginative
pencil
of
such
an
artist
nevertheless
i
hope
that
some
of
them
may
lead
future
travelers
to
penetrate
still
farther
into
the
land
of
the
incas
and
engage
in
the
fascinating
game
of
identifying
elusive
places
mentioned
in
the
chronicles
some
of
my
story
has
already
been
told
in
harper
and
the
national
geographic
to
whose
editors
acknowledgments
are
due
for
permission
to
use
the
material
in
its
present
form
a
glance
at
the
bibliography
will
show
that
more
than
fifty
articles
and
monographs
have
been
published
as
a
result
of
the
peruvian
expeditions
of
yale
university
and
the
national
geographic
society
other
reports
are
still
in
course
of
preparation
my
own
observations
are
based
partly
on
a
study
of
these
monographs
and
the
writings
of
former
travelers
partly
on
the
maps
and
notes
made
by
my
companions
and
partly
on
a
study
of
our
peruvian
photographs
a
collection
now
numbering
over
eleven
thousand
negatives
another
source
of
information
was
the
opportunity
of
frequent
conferences
with
my
fellow
explorers
one
of
the
great
advantages
of
large
expeditions
is
the
bringing
to
bear
on
the
same
problem
of
minds
which
have
received
widely
different
training

were
not
always
free
from
discomfort
or
danger
i
desire
to
acknowledge
most
fully
my
great
obligations
in
the
following
pages
they
will
sometimes
recognize
their
handiwork
at
other
times
they
may
wonder
why
it
has
been
overlooked
perhaps
in
another
volume
which
is
already
under
way
and
in
which
i
hope
to
cover
more
particularly
machu
picchu
and
its
vicinity
they
will
eventually
find
much
of
what
can
not
be
told
here
sincere
and
grateful
thanks
are
due
also
to

offering
generous
assistance
when
aid
was
most
difficult
to
secure
to

chapter
i
crossing
the
desert
a
kind
friend
in
bolivia
once
placed
in
my
hands
a
copy
of
a
most
interesting
book
by
the
late
george
squier
entitled
peru
travel
and
exploration
in
the
land
of
the
incas
in
that
volume
is
a
marvelous
picture
of
the
apurimac
valley
in
the
foreground
is
a
delicate
suspension
bridge
which
commences
at
a
tunnel
in
the
face
of
a
precipitous
cliff
and
hangs
in
at
great
height
above
the
swirling
waters
of
the
great
speaker
in
the
distance
towering
above
a
mass
of
stupendous
mountains
is
a
magnificent
peak
the
desire
to
see
the
apurimac
and
experience
the
thrill
of
crossing
that
bridge
decided
me
in
favor
of
an
overland
journey
to
lima
as
a
result
i
went
to
cuzco
the
ancient
capital
of
the
mighty
empire
of
the
incas
and
was
there
urged
by
the
peruvian
authorities
to
visit
some
newly
inca
ruins
as
readers
of
across
south
america
will
remember
these
ruins
were
at
choqquequirau
an
interesting
place
on
top
of
a
ridge
several
thousand
feet
above
the
roaring
rapids
of
the
great
apurimac
there
was
some
doubt
as
to
who
had
originally
lived
here
the
prefect
insisted
that
the
ruins
represented
the
residence
of
the
inca
manco
and
his
sons
who
had
sought
refuge
from
pizarro
and
the
spanish
conquerors
of
peru
in
the
andes
between
the
apurimac
and
urubamba
rivers
while
clarence
hay
and
i
were
on
the
slopes
of
choqquequirau
the
clouds
would
occasionally
break
away
and
give
us
tantalizing
glimpses
of
mountains
there
seemed
to
be
an
unknown
region
behind
the
ranges
which
might
contain
great
possibilities
our
guides
could
tell
us
nothing
about
it
little
was
to
be
found
in
books
perhaps
manco
capital
was
hidden
there
for
months
afterwards
the
fascination
of
the
unknown
drew
my
thoughts
to
choqquequirau
and
beyond
in
the
words
of
kipling
explorer
a
voice
as
bad
as
conscience
rang
interminable
changes
on
one
everlasting
whisper
day
and
night
repeated
so
hidden
go
and
find
it
go
and
look
behind
the
ranges
something
lost
behind
the
ranges
lost
and
waiting
for
you
go
to
add
to
my
unrest
during
the
following
summer
i
read
titicaca
and
koati
which
had
just
appeared
in
one
of
the
interesting
footnotes
was
this
startling
remark
it
is
much
to
be
desired
that
the
elevation
of
the
most
prominent
peaks
of
the
western
or
coast
range
of
peru
be
accurately
determined
it
is
likely
that
coropuna
in
the
peruvian
coast
range
of
the
department
arequipa
is
the
culminating
point
of
the
continent
it
exceeds
feet
in
height
whereas
aconcagua
conceded
to
be
the
highest
peak
in
the
western
hemisphere
is
but
feet
meters
above
sea
level
his
estimate
was
based
on
a
survey
made
by
the
civil
engineers
of
the
southern
railways
of
peru
using
a
section
of
the
railroad
as
a
base
my
sensations
when
i
read
this
are
difficult
to
describe
although
i
had
been
studying
south
american
history
and
geography
for
more
than
ten
years
i
did
not
remember
ever
to
have
heard
of
coropuna
on
most
maps
it
did
not
exist
fortunately
on
one
of
the
sheets
of
raimondi
map
of
peru
i
finally
found
coropuna
meters
higher
than
aconcagua
one
hundred
miles
northwest
of
arequipa
near
the
meridian
west
of
greenwich
looking
up
and
down
the
meridian
as
it
crossed
peru
from
the
amazon
valley
to
the
pacific
ocean
i
saw
that
it
passed
very
near
choqquequirau
and
actually
traversed
those
very
lands
behind
the
ranges
which
had
been
beckoning
to
me
the
coincidence
was
intriguing
the
desire
to
go
and
find
that
something
hidden
was
now
reënforced
by
the
temptation
to
go
and
see
whether
coropuna
really
was
the
highest
mountain
in
america
there
followed
the
organization
of
an
expedition
whose
object
was
a
geographical
reconnaissance
of
peru
along
the
meridian
from
the
head
of
canoe
navigation
on
the
urubamba
to
tidewater
on
the
pacific
we
achieved
more
than
we
expected
our
success
was
due
in
large
part
to
our
a
device
containing
a
balanced
ration
which
professor
harry
foote
had
cooperated
with
me
in
assembling
the
object
of
our
idea
was
to
facilitate
the
provisioning
of
small
field
parties
by
packing
in
a
single
box
everything
that
two
men
would
need
in
the
way
of
provisions
for
a
given
period
these
boxes
have
given
such
general
satisfaction
not
only
to
the
explorers
themselves
but
to
the
surgeons
who
had
the
responsibility
of
keeping
them
in
good
condition
that
a
few
words
in
regard
to
this
feature
of
our
equipment
may
not
be
unwelcome
the
best
provides
a
balanced
ration
for
two
men
for
eight
days
breakfast
and
supper
being
hearty
cooked
meals
and
luncheon
light
and
uncooked
it
was
not
intended
that
the
men
should
depend
entirely
on
the
but
should
vary
their
diet
as
much
as
possible
with
whatever
the
country
afforded
which
in
southern
peru
frequently
means
potatoes
corn
eggs
mutton
and
bread
nevertheless
each
box
contained
sliced
bacon
tinned
corned
beef
roast
beef
chicken
salmon
crushed
oats
milk
cheese
coffee
sugar
rice
army
bread
salt
sweet
chocolates
assorted
jams
pickles
and
dried
fruits
and
vegetables
by
seeing
that
the
jam
dried
fruits
soups
and
dried
vegetables
were
well
assorted
a
sufficient
variety
was
procured
without
destroying
the
balanced
character
of
the
ration
on
account
of
the
great
difficulty
of
transportation
in
the
southern
andes
we
had
to
eliminate
foods
that
contained
a
large
amount
of
water
like
french
peas
baked
beans
and
canned
fruits
however
delicious
and
desirable
they
might
be
in
addition
to
food
we
found
it
desirable
to
include
in
each
box
a
cake
of
laundry
soap
two
yards
of
dish
toweling
and
three
empty
bags
to
be
used
for
carrying
lunches
and
collecting
specimens
the
most
highly
appreciated
article
of
food
in
our
boxes
was
the
rolled
oats
a
dish
which
on
account
of
its
being
already
partially
cooked
was
easily
prepared
at
high
elevations
where
rice
can
not
be
properly
boiled
it
was
difficult
to
satisfy
the
members
of
the
expedition
by
providing
the
right
amount
of
sugar
at
the
beginning
of
the
field
season
the
allowance
one
third
of
a
pound
per
day
per
man
seemed
excessive
and
i
was
criticized
for
having
overloaded
the
boxes
after
a
month
in
the
field
the
allowance
proved
to
be
too
small
and
had
to
be
supplemented
many
people
seem
to
think
that
it
is
one
of
the
duties
of
an
explorer
to
rough
it
and
to
trust
to
luck
for
his
food
i
had
found
on
my
first
two
expeditions
in
venezuela
and
colombia
and
across
south
america
that
the
result
of
being
obliged
to
subsist
on
irregular
and
haphazard
rations
was
most
unsatisfactory
while
roughing
it
is
far
more
enticing
to
the
inexperienced
and
indiscreet
explorer
i
learned
in
peru
that
the
humdrum
expedient
of
carefully
preparing
months
in
advance
a
comprehensive
bill
of
fare
sufficiently
varied
wholesome
and
is
the
better
part
of
valor
the
truth
is
that
providing
an
abundance
of
appetizing
food
adds
very
greatly
to
the
effectiveness
of
a
party
to
be
sure
it
may
mean
trouble
and
expense
for
one
transportation
department
and
some
of
the
younger
men
may
feel
that
their
reputations
as
explorers
are
likely
to
be
damaged
if
it
is
known
that
strawberry
jam
sweet
chocolate
and
pickles
are
frequently
found
on
their
menu
nevertheless
experience
has
shown
that
the
results
of
trusting
to
luck
and
living
as
the
natives
do
means
not
only
loss
of
efficiency
in
the
day
work
but
also
lessened
powers
of
observation
and
diminished
enthusiasm
for
the
drudgery
of
scientific
exploration
exciting
things
are
always
easy
to
do
no
matter
how
you
are
living
but
frequently
they
produce
less
important
results
than
tasks
which
depend
upon
daily
drudgery
and
daily
drudgery
depends
upon
a
regular
supply
of
wholesome
food
we
reached
arequipa
the
proposed
base
for
our
campaign
against
mt
coropuna
in
june
we
learned
that
the
peruvian
winter
reaches
its
climax
in
july
or
august
and
that
it
would
be
folly
to
try
to
climb
coropuna
during
the
winter
snowstorms
on
the
other
hand
the
summer
months
beginning
with
november
are
cloudy
and
likely
to
add
fog
and
mist
to
the
difficulties
of
climbing
a
new
mountain
furthermore
june
and
july
are
the
best
months
for
exploration
in
the
eastern
slopes
of
the
andes
in
the
upper
amazon
basin
the
lands
behind
the
ranges
although
the
montaña
or
jungle
country
is
rarely
actually
dry
there
is
less
rain
then
than
in
the
other
months
of
the
year
so
we
decided
to
go
first
to
the
urubamba
valley
the
story
of
our
discoveries
there
of
identifying
uiticos
the
capital
of
the
last
incas
and
of
the
finding
of
machu
picchu
will
be
found
in
later
chapters
in
september
i
returned
to
arequipa
and
started
the
campaign
against
coropuna
by
endeavoring
to
get
adequate
transportation
facilities
for
crossing
the
desert
arequipa
as
everybody
knows
is
the
home
of
a
station
of
the
harvard
observatory
but
arequipa
is
also
famous
for
its
large
mules
unfortunately
a
mule
trust
had
recently
been
formed
needless
to
say
by
an
american
and
i
found
it
difficult
to
make
any
satisfactory
arrangements
after
two
weeks
of
skirmishing
the
tejada
brothers
appeared
two
arrieros
or
muleteers
who
seemed
willing
to
listen
to
our
proposals
we
offered
them
a
thousand
soles
five
hundred
dollars
gold
if
they
would
supply
us
with
a
pack
train
of
eleven
mules
for
two
months
and
go
with
us
wherever
we
chose
we
agreeing
not
to
travel
on
an
average
more
than
seven
leagues
a
day
it
sounds
simple
enough
but
it
took
no
end
of
argument
and
persuasion
on
the
part
of
our
friends
in
arequipa
to
convince
these
worthy
arrieros
that
they
were
not
going
to
be
everlastingly
ruined
by
this
bargain
the
trouble
was
that
they
owned
their
mules
knew
the
great
danger
of
crossing
the
deserts
that
lay
between
us
and
mt
coropuna
and
feared
to
travel
on
unknown
trails
like
most
muleteers
they
were
afraid
of
unfamiliar
country
they
magnified
the
imaginary
evils
of
the
road
to
an
inconceivable
pitch
the
argument
that
finally
persuaded
them
to
accept
the
proffered
contract
was
my
promise
that
after
the
first
week
the
cargo
would
be
so
much
less
that
at
least
two
of
the
pack
mules
could
always
be
free
the
tejadas
realizing
only
too
well
the
propensity
of
pack
animals
to
get
sore
backs
and
go
lame
regarded
my
promise
in
the
light
of
a
factor
of
safety
lame
mules
would
not
have
to
carry
loads
everything
was
ready
by
the
end
of
the
month
tucker
a
member
of
professor
parker
mckinley
expedition
and
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
details
of
whom
i
had
asked
to
be
responsible
for
securing
the
proper
equipment
was
now
entrusted
with
planning
and
directing
the
actual
ascent
of
coropuna
whatever
success
was
achieved
on
the
mountain
was
due
primarily
to
tucker
skill
and
foresight
we
had
no
swiss
guides
and
had
originally
intended
to
ask
two
other
members
of
the
expedition
to
join
us
on
the
climb
however
the
exigencies
of
making
a
geological
and
topographical
cross
section
along
the
meridian
through
a
practically
unknown
region
and
across
one
of
the
highest
passes
in
the
andes
had
delayed
the
surveying
party
to
such
an
extent
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
them
to
reach
coropuna
before
the
first
of
november
on
account
of
the
approach
of
the
cloudy
season
it
did
not
seem
wise
to
wait
for
their
coöperation
accordingly
i
secured
in
arequipa
the
services
of
casimir
watkins
an
english
naturalist
and
of
hinckley
of
the
harvard
observatory
it
was
proposed
that
hinckley
who
had
twice
ascended
el
misti
should
accompany
us
to
the
top
while
watkins
who
had
only
recently
recovered
from
a
severe
illness
should
take
charge
of
the
base
camp
the
prefect
of
arequipa
obligingly
offered
us
a
military
escort
in
the
person
of
corporal
gamarra
a
indian
of
rather
more
than
average
height
and
considerably
more
than
average
courage
who
knew
the
country
as
a
member
of
the
mounted
gendarmerie
gamarra
had
been
stationed
at
the
provincial
capital
of
cotahuasi
a
few
months
previously
one
day
a
mob
of
drunken
riotous
revolutionists
stormed
the
government
buildings
while
he
was
on
sentry
duty
gamarra
stood
his
ground
and
when
they
attempted
to
force
their
way
past
him
shot
the
leader
of
the
crowd
the
mob
scattered
a
grateful
prefect
made
him
a
corporal
and
realizing
that
his
life
was
no
longer
safe
in
that
particular
vicinity
transferred
him
to
arequipa
like
nearly
all
of
his
race
however
he
fell
an
easy
prey
to
alcohol
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
chief
of
the
mounted
police
in
arequipa
when
ordered
by
the
prefect
to
furnish
us
an
escort
for
our
journey
across
the
desert
was
glad
enough
to
assign
gamarra
to
us
his
courage
could
not
be
called
in
question
even
though
his
habits
might
lead
him
to
become
troublesome
it
happened
that
gamarra
did
not
know
we
were
planning
to
go
to
cotahuasi
had
he
known
this
and
also
had
he
suspected
the
trials
that
were
before
him
on
mt
coropuna
he
probably
would
have
begged
off
but
i
am
anticipating
on
the
of
october
tucker
hinckley
corporal
gamarra
and
i
left
arequipa
watkins
followed
a
week
later
the
first
stage
of
the
journey
was
by
train
from
arequipa
to
vitor
a
distance
of
thirty
miles
the
arrieros
sent
the
cargo
along
too
in
addition
to
the
we
brought
with
us
tents
ice
axes
snowshoes
barometers
thermometers
transit
fiber
cases
steel
boxes
duffle
bags
and
a
folding
boat
our
pack
train
was
supposed
to
have
started
from
arequipa
the
day
before
we
hoped
it
would
reach
vitor
about
the
same
time
that
we
did
but
that
was
expecting
too
much
of
arrieros
on
the
first
day
of
their
journey
so
we
had
an
wait
near
the
primitive
little
railway
station
we
amused
ourselves
wandering
off
over
the
neighboring
pampa
and
studying
the
médanos
sand
dunes
which
are
common
in
the
great
coastal
desert
one
reads
so
much
of
the
great
tropical
jungles
of
south
america
and
of
wellnigh
impenetrable
forests
that
it
is
difficult
to
realize
that
the
west
coast
from
ecuador
on
the
north
to
the
heart
of
chile
on
the
south
is
a
great
desert
broken
at
intervals
by
oases
or
valleys
whose
rivers
coming
from
melting
snows
of
the
andes
are
here
and
there
diverted
for
purposes
of
irrigation
lima
the
capital
of
peru
is
in
one
of
the
largest
of
these
oases
although
frequently
enveloped
in
a
damp
fog
the
peruvian
coastal
towns
are
almost
never
subjected
to
rain
the
causes
of
this
phenomenon
are
easy
to
understand
winds
coming
from
the
east
laden
with
the
moisture
of
the
atlantic
ocean
and
the
steaming
amazon
basin
are
rapidly
cooled
by
the
eastern
slopes
of
the
andes
and
forced
to
deposit
this
moisture
in
the
montaña
by
the
time
the
winds
have
crossed
the
mighty
cordillera
there
is
no
rain
left
in
them
conversely
the
winds
that
come
from
the
warm
pacific
ocean
strike
a
cold
area
over
the
frigid
humboldt
current
which
sweeps
up
along
the
west
coast
of
south
america
this
cold
belt
wrings
the
water
out
of
the
westerly
winds
so
that
by
the
time
they
reach
the
warm
land
their
relative
humidity
is
low
to
be
sure
there
are
months
in
some
years
when
so
much
moisture
falls
on
the
slopes
of
the
coast
range
that
the
hillsides
are
clothed
with
flowers
but
this
verdure
lasts
but
a
short
time
and
does
not
seriously
affect
the
great
stretches
of
desert
pampa
in
the
midst
of
which
we
now
were
like
the
other
pampas
of
this
region
the
flat
surface
inclines
toward
the
sea
over
it
the
sand
is
rolled
along
by
the
wind
and
finally
built
into
dunes
these
médanos
interested
us
greatly
the
prevailing
wind
on
the
desert
at
night
is
a
relatively
gentle
breeze
that
comes
down
from
the
cool
mountain
slopes
toward
the
ocean
it
tends
to
blow
the
lighter
particles
of
sand
along
in
a
regular
dune
rolling
it
over
and
over
downhill
leaving
the
heavier
particles
behind
this
is
reversed
in
the
daytime
as
the
heat
increases
toward
noon
the
wind
comes
rushing
up
from
the
ocean
to
fill
the
vacuum
caused
by
the
rapidly
ascending
currents
of
hot
air
that
rise
from
the
overheated
pampas
during
the
early
afternoon
this
wind
reaches
a
high
velocity
and
swirls
the
sand
along
in
clouds
it
is
now
strong
enough
to
move
the
heavier
particles
of
sand
uphill
it
sweeps
the
heaviest
ones
around
the
base
of
the
dune
and
deposits
them
in
pointed
ridges
on
either
side
the
heavier
material
remains
stationary
at
night
while
the
lighter
particles
are
rolled
downhill
but
the
whole
mass
travels
slowly
uphill
again
during
the
gales
of
the
following
afternoon
the
result
is
the
beautiful
médano
about
five
our
mules
a
lot
far
superior
to
any
that
we
had
been
able
to
secure
near
cuzco
trotted
briskly
into
the
dusty
little
plaza
it
took
some
time
to
adjust
the
loads
and
it
was
nearly
seven
before
we
started
off
in
the
moonlight
for
the
oasis
of
vitor
as
we
left
the
plateau
and
struck
the
dusty
trail
winding
down
into
a
dark
canyon
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
white
shimmering
faintly
on
the
horizon
far
off
to
the
northwest
coropuna
shortly
before
nine
we
reached
a
little
corral
where
the
mules
were
unloaded
for
ourselves
we
found
a
shed
with
a
clean
floor
where
we
set
up
our
cots
only
to
be
awakened
many
times
during
the
night
by
passing
caravans
anxious
to
avoid
the
terrible
heat
of
the
desert
by
day
figure
mt
coropuna
from
the
northwest
where
the
oases
are
only
a
few
miles
apart
one
often
travels
by
day
but
when
crossing
the
desert
is
a
matter
of
eight
or
ten
steady
jogging
with
no
places
to
rest
no
water
no
shade
the
pack
animals
suffer
greatly
consequently
most
caravans
travel
so
far
as
possible
by
night
our
first
desert
the
pampa
of
sihuas
was
reported
to
be
narrow
so
we
preferred
to
cross
it
by
day
and
see
what
was
to
be
seen
we
got
up
about
four
and
were
off
before
seven
then
our
troubles
began
either
because
he
lived
in
arequipa
or
because
they
thought
he
looked
like
a
good
horseman
or
for
reasons
best
known
to
themselves
the
tejadas
had
given
hinckley
a
very
spirited
the
first
thing
i
knew
her
rider
carrying
a
heavy
camera
a
package
of
and
a
large
mercurial
barometer
borrowed
from
the
harvard
observatory
was
pitched
headlong
into
the
sand
fortunately
no
damage
was
done
and
after
a
lively
chase
the
runaway
mule
was
brought
back
by
corporal
gamarra
after
hinckley
was
remounted
on
his
dangerous
mule
we
rode
on
for
a
while
in
peace
between
cornfields
and
vineyards
over
paths
flanked
by
willows
and
fig
trees
the
chief
industry
of
vitor
is
the
making
of
wine
from
vines
which
date
back
to
colonial
days
the
wine
is
aged
in
huge
jars
each
over
six
feet
high
buried
in
the
ground
we
had
a
glimpse
of
seventeen
of
them
standing
in
a
line
awaiting
sale
it
made
one
think
of
ali
baba
and
the
forty
thieves
who
would
have
had
no
trouble
at
all
hiding
in
these
cyclopean
crocks
the
edge
of
the
oasis
of
vitor
is
the
contour
line
along
which
the
irrigating
canal
runs
there
is
no
gradual
petering
out
of
foliage
the
desert
begins
with
a
stunning
crash
on
one
side
is
the
bright
luxurious
green
of
fig
trees
and
vineyards
on
the
other
side
is
the
absolute
stark
nakedness
of
the
sandy
desert
within
the
oasis
there
is
an
abundance
of
water
much
of
it
runs
to
waste
the
wine
growers
receive
more
than
they
can
use
in
fact
more
land
could
easily
be
put
under
cultivation
the
chief
difficulties
are
the
scarcity
of
ports
from
which
produce
can
be
shipped
to
the
outer
world
the
expense
of
the
transportation
system
of
pack
trains
over
the
deserts
which
intervene
between
the
oases
and
the
railroad
and
the
lack
of
capital
otherwise
the
irrigation
system
might
be
extended
over
great
stretches
of
rich
volcanic
soil
now
unoccupied
a
steady
climb
of
three
quarters
of
an
hour
took
us
to
the
northern
rim
of
the
valley
here
we
again
saw
the
snowy
mass
of
coropuna
glistening
in
the
sunlight
miles
away
to
the
northwest
our
view
was
a
short
one
for
in
less
than
three
minutes
we
had
to
descend
another
canyon
we
crossed
this
and
climbed
out
on
the
pampa
of
sihuas
there
was
little
to
interest
us
in
our
immediate
surroundings
but
in
the
distance
was
coropuna
and
i
had
just
begun
to
study
the
problem
of
possible
routes
for
climbing
the
highest
peak
when
mule
trotted
briskly
across
the
trail
directly
in
front
of
me
kicked
up
her
heels
and
again
sent
him
sprawling
over
the
sand
barometer
camera
plates
and
all
unluckily
this
time
his
foot
caught
in
a
stirrup
and
still
holding
the
bridle
he
was
dragged
some
distance
before
he
got
it
loose
he
struggled
to
his
feet
and
tried
to
keep
the
mule
from
running
away
when
a
violent
kick
released
his
hold
and
knocked
him
out
we
immediately
set
up
our
little
mummery
tent
on
the
hot
sandy
floor
of
the
desert
and
rendered
to
the
unlucky
astronomer
we
found
that
the
sharp
point
of
one
of
the
vicious
mule
new
shoes
had
opened
a
large
vein
in
leg
the
cut
was
not
dangerous
but
too
deep
for
successful
mountain
climbing
with
gamarra
aid
hinckley
was
able
to
reach
arequipa
that
night
but
his
enforced
departure
not
only
shattered
his
own
hopes
of
climbing
coropuna
but
also
made
us
wonder
how
we
were
going
to
have
the
necessary
when
we
reached
the
glaciers
to
be
sure
there
was
the
corporal
but
would
he
go
indians
do
not
like
snow
mountains
packing
up
the
tent
again
we
resumed
our
course
over
the
desert
the
oasis
of
sihuas
another
beautiful
garden
in
the
bottom
of
a
huge
canyon
was
reached
about
four
in
the
afternoon
we
should
have
been
compelled
to
camp
in
the
open
with
the
arrieros
had
not
the
parish
priest
invited
us
to
rest
in
the
cool
shade
of
his
arbor
he
graciously
served
us
with
cakes
and
sweet
native
wine
and
asked
us
to
stay
as
long
as
we
liked
the
desert
of
majes
which
now
lay
ahead
of
us
is
perhaps
the
widest
hottest
and
most
barren
in
this
region
our
arrieros
were
unwilling
to
cross
it
in
the
daytime
they
said
it
was
miles
between
water
and
water
the
next
day
we
enjoyed
the
hospitality
of
our
kindly
host
until
after
supper
so
sure
are
the
inhabitants
of
these
oases
that
it
is
not
going
to
rain
that
their
houses
are
built
merely
as
a
shelter
against
the
sun
and
wind
they
are
made
of
the
canes
that
grow
in
the
jungles
of
the
larger
river
bottoms
or
along
the
banks
of
irrigating
ditches
on
the
roof
the
spaces
between
the
canes
are
filled
with
adobe
mud
it
is
not
necessary
to
plaster
the
sides
of
the
houses
for
it
is
pleasant
to
let
the
air
have
free
play
and
it
is
amusing
to
look
out
through
the
cracks
and
see
everything
that
is
passing
that
evening
we
saddled
in
the
moonlight
slowly
we
climbed
out
of
the
valley
to
spend
the
night
jogging
steadily
hour
after
hour
across
the
desert
as
the
moon
was
setting
we
entered
a
hilly
region
and
at
sunrise
found
ourselves
in
the
midst
of
a
tumbled
mass
of
enormous
sand
dunes
the
result
of
hundreds
of
médanos
blown
across
the
pampa
of
majes
and
deposited
along
the
border
of
the
valley
it
took
us
three
hours
to
wind
slowly
down
from
the
level
of
the
desert
to
a
point
where
we
could
see
the
great
canyon
a
mile
deep
and
two
miles
across
its
steep
sides
are
of
various
colored
rocks
and
sand
the
bottom
is
a
bright
green
oasis
through
which
flows
the
rapid
majes
river
too
deep
to
be
forded
even
in
the
dry
season
a
very
large
part
of
the
flood
plain
of
the
unruly
river
is
not
cultivated
and
consists
of
a
wild
jungle
difficult
of
access
in
the
dry
season
and
impossible
when
the
river
rises
during
the
rainy
months
the
contrast
between
the
gigantic
hills
of
sand
and
the
luxurious
vegetation
was
very
striking
but
to
us
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
landscape
was
the
long
glistening
white
mass
of
coropuna
now
much
larger
and
just
visible
above
the
opposite
rim
of
the
valley
at
eight
in
the
morning
as
we
were
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
we
could
get
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
valley
and
have
some
breakfast
we
discovered
at
a
place
called
pitas
or
cerro
colorado
a
huge
volcanic
boulder
covered
with
rude
pictographs
further
search
in
the
vicinity
revealed
about
one
hundred
of
these
boulders
each
with
its
quota
of
crude
drawings
i
did
not
notice
any
ruins
of
houses
near
the
rocks
neither
of
the
tejada
brothers
who
had
been
past
here
many
times
nor
any
of
the
natives
of
this
region
appeared
to
have
any
idea
of
the
origin
or
meaning
of
this
singular
collection
of
pictographic
rocks
the
drawings
represented
jaguars
birds
men
and
dogs
they
deserved
careful
study
yet
not
even
the
interest
and
excitement
of
investigating
the
rocas
jeroglificos
as
they
are
called
here
could
make
us
forget
that
we
had
had
no
food
or
sleep
for
a
good
many
hours
so
after
taking
a
few
pictures
we
hastened
on
and
crossed
the
majes
river
on
a
very
shaky
temporary
bridge
it
was
built
to
last
only
during
the
dry
season
to
construct
a
bridge
which
would
withstand
floods
is
not
feasible
at
present
we
spent
the
day
at
coriri
a
pleasant
little
village
where
it
was
almost
impossible
to
sleep
on
account
of
the
myriads
of
gnats
the
next
day
we
had
a
short
ride
along
the
western
side
of
the
valley
to
the
town
of
aplao
the
capital
of
the
province
of
castilla
called
by
its
present
inhabitants
majes
although
on
raimondi
map
that
name
is
applied
only
to
the
river
and
the
neighboring
desert
in
at
the
time
of
his
visit
it
had
a
bad
reputation
for
disease
now
it
seems
more
healthy
the
of
castilla
had
been
informed
by
telegraph
of
our
coming
and
invited
us
to
an
excellent
dinner
the
people
of
majes
are
largely
of
mixed
white
and
indian
ancestry
many
of
them
appeared
to
be
unusually
businesslike
the
proprietor
of
one
establishment
was
a
great
admirer
of
american
shoes
the
name
of
which
he
pronounced
in
a
manner
that
puzzled
us
for
a
long
time
w
is
unknown
in
spanish
and
the
letters
a
l
and
k
are
never
found
in
juxtaposition
when
he
asked
us
what
we
thought
of
accenting
strongly
the
last
syllable
we
could
not
imagine
what
he
meant
he
was
equally
at
a
loss
to
understand
how
we
could
be
so
stupid
as
not
to
recognize
immediately
the
name
of
a
widely
known
shoe
at
majes
we
observed
cotton
which
is
sent
to
the
mills
at
arequipa
alfalfa
highly
prized
as
fodder
for
pack
animals
sugar
cane
from
which
aguardiente
or
white
rum
is
made
and
grapes
it
is
said
that
the
majes
vineyards
date
back
to
the
sixteenth
century
and
that
some
of
the
huge
buried
earthenware
wine
jars
now
in
use
were
made
as
far
back
as
the
reign
of
philip
ii
the
presence
of
so
much
wine
in
the
community
does
not
seem
to
have
a
deleterious
effect
on
the
natives
who
were
not
only
hospitable
but
energetic
far
more
so
in
fact
than
the
natives
of
towns
in
the
high
andes
where
the
intense
cold
and
the
difficulty
of
making
a
living
have
reacted
upon
the
indians
often
causing
them
to
be
morose
sullen
and
without
ambition
the
residences
of
the
wine
growers
are
sometimes
very
misleading
a
typical
country
house
of
the
better
class
is
not
much
to
look
at
its
long
low
flat
roof
and
rough
unwhitewashed
walls
give
it
an
unattractive
appearance
yet
to
one
intense
surprise
the
inside
may
be
clean
and
comfortable
with
modern
furniture
a
piano
and
a
phonograph
our
conscientious
and
arrieros
rose
at
two
the
next
morning
for
they
knew
their
mules
had
a
long
hard
climb
ahead
of
them
from
an
elevation
of
feet
above
sea
level
to
feet
after
an
journey
we
camped
at
a
place
where
forage
could
be
obtained
we
had
now
left
the
region
of
tropical
products
and
come
back
to
potatoes
and
barley
the
following
day
a
short
ride
brought
us
past
another
pictographic
rock
recently
blasted
open
by
an
energetic
treasure
seeker
of
chuquibamba
this
town
has
inhabitants
and
is
the
capital
of
the
province
of
condesuyos
it
was
the
place
which
we
had
selected
several
months
before
as
the
rendezvous
for
the
attack
on
coropuna
the
climate
here
is
delightful
and
the
fruits
and
cereals
of
the
temperate
zone
are
easily
raised
the
town
is
surrounded
by
gardens
vineyards
alfalfa
and
grain
fields
all
showing
evidence
of
intensive
cultivation
it
is
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
branches
of
the
majes
valley
and
is
surrounded
by
high
cliffs
the
people
of
chuquibamba
were
friendly
we
were
kindly
welcomed
by
señor
benavides
the
who
hospitably
told
us
to
set
up
our
cots
in
the
grand
salon
of
his
own
house
here
we
received
calls
from
the
local
officials
including
the
provincial
physician
pastór
and
the
director
of
the
colegio
nacional
professor
alejandro
coello
the
last
two
were
keen
to
go
with
us
up
mt
coropuna
they
told
us
that
there
was
a
hill
near
by
called
the
calvario
whence
the
mountain
could
be
seen
and
offered
to
take
us
up
there
we
accepted
thinking
at
the
same
time
that
this
would
show
who
was
best
fitted
to
join
in
the
climb
for
we
needed
another
man
on
the
rope
professor
coello
easily
distanced
the
rest
of
us
and
won
the
coveted
place
from
the
calvario
hill
we
had
a
splendid
view
of
those
white
solitudes
whither
we
were
bound
now
only
miles
away
it
seemed
clear
that
the
western
or
truncated
peak
which
gives
its
name
to
the
mass
koro
cut
off
at
the
top
puna
a
cold
snowy
height
was
the
highest
point
of
the
range
and
higher
than
all
the
eastern
peaks
yet
behind
the
dome
we
could
just
make
out
a
northerly
peak
tucker
wondered
whether
or
not
that
might
prove
to
be
higher
than
the
western
peak
which
we
decided
to
climb
no
one
knew
anything
about
the
mountain
there
were
no
native
guides
to
be
had
the
wildest
opinions
were
expressed
as
to
the
best
routes
and
methods
of
getting
to
the
top
we
finally
engaged
a
man
who
said
he
knew
how
to
get
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
so
we
called
him
guide
for
want
of
a
more
appropriate
title
the
peruvian
spring
was
now
well
advanced
and
the
days
were
fine
and
clear
it
appeared
however
that
there
had
been
a
heavy
snowstorm
on
the
mountain
a
few
days
before
if
summer
were
coming
unusually
early
it
behooved
us
to
waste
no
time
and
we
proceeded
to
arrange
the
mountain
equipment
as
fast
as
possible
our
instruments
for
determining
altitude
consisted
of
a
special
barometer
made
by
henry
j
green
of
brooklyn
capable
of
recording
only
such
air
pressures
as
one
might
expect
to
find
above
feet
a
hypsometer
loaned
us
by
the
department
of
terrestrial
magnetism
of
the
carnegie
institution
of
washington
with
thermometers
especially
made
for
us
by
green
a
large
mercurial
barometer
borrowed
from
the
harvard
observatory
which
notwithstanding
its
rough
treatment
by
hinckley
mule
was
still
doing
good
service
and
one
of
green
sling
psychrometers
our
most
serious
want
was
an
aneroid
in
case
the
fragile
mercurials
should
get
broken
six
months
previously
i
had
written
to
hicks
the
celebrated
instrument
maker
of
london
asking
him
to
construct
with
special
care
two
large
watkins
aneroids
capable
of
recording
altitudes
five
thousand
feet
higher
than
coropuna
was
supposed
to
be
his
reply
had
never
reached
me
nor
did
any
one
in
arequipa
know
anything
about
the
barometers
apparently
my
letter
had
miscarried
it
was
not
until
we
opened
our
specially
ordered
mountain
grub
boxes
here
in
chuquibamba
that
we
found
alongside
of
the
pemmican
and
tins
of
stew
which
had
been
packed
for
us
in
london
by
grace
brothers
the
two
precious
aneroids
each
as
large
as
a
big
alarm
clock
with
these
two
new
aneroids
made
with
a
wide
margin
of
safety
we
felt
satisfied
that
once
at
the
summit
we
should
know
whether
there
was
a
chance
that
bandelier
was
right
and
this
was
indeed
the
top
of
america
for
exact
measurements
we
depended
on
topographer
hendriksen
who
was
due
to
triangulate
coropuna
in
the
course
of
his
survey
along
the
meridian
my
chief
excuse
for
going
up
the
mountain
was
to
erect
a
signal
at
or
near
the
top
which
hendriksen
could
use
as
a
station
in
order
to
make
his
triangulation
more
exact
my
real
object
it
must
be
confessed
was
to
enjoy
the
satisfaction
which
all
alpinists
feel
of
conquering
a
virgin
peak
chapter
ii
climbing
coropuna
the
desert
plateau
above
chuquibamba
is
nearly
feet
higher
than
the
town
and
it
was
nine
on
the
morning
of
october
before
we
got
out
of
the
valley
thereafter
coropuna
was
always
in
sight
and
as
we
slowly
approached
it
we
studied
it
with
care
the
plateau
has
an
elevation
of
over
feet
yet
the
mountain
stood
out
conspicuously
above
it
coropuna
is
really
a
range
about
twenty
miles
long
its
gigantic
massif
was
covered
with
snow
fields
from
one
end
to
the
other
so
deep
did
the
fresh
snow
lie
that
it
was
generally
impossible
to
see
where
snow
fields
ended
and
glaciers
began
we
could
see
that
of
the
five
peaks
the
middle
one
was
probably
the
lowest
the
two
next
highest
are
at
the
right
or
eastern
end
of
the
massif
the
culminating
truncated
dome
at
the
western
end
with
its
smooth
uneroded
sides
apparently
belonged
to
a
later
volcanic
period
than
the
rest
of
the
mountain
it
seemed
to
be
the
highest
peak
of
all
to
reach
it
did
not
appear
to
be
difficult
slopes
ran
directly
up
to
the
snow
snow
fields
without
many
appeared
to
culminate
in
a
saddle
at
the
base
of
the
great
snowy
dome
the
eastern
slope
of
the
dome
itself
offered
an
unbroken
if
steep
path
to
the
top
if
we
could
once
reach
the
snow
line
it
looked
as
though
with
the
aid
of
or
snowshoes
we
could
climb
the
mountain
without
serious
trouble
figure
mt
coropuna
from
the
south
between
us
and
the
first
slopes
however
lay
more
than
twenty
miles
of
volcanic
desert
intersected
by
deep
canyons
steep
quebradas
and
very
rough
aa
lava
directed
by
our
guide
we
left
the
cotahuasi
road
and
struck
across
country
dodging
the
lava
flows
and
slowly
ascending
the
gentle
slope
of
the
plateau
as
it
became
steeper
our
mules
showed
signs
of
suffering
while
waiting
for
them
to
get
their
wind
we
went
ahead
on
foot
climbed
a
short
rise
and
to
our
surprise
and
chagrin
found
ourselves
on
the
rim
of
a
canyon
feet
deep
which
cut
right
across
in
front
of
the
mountain
and
lay
between
us
and
its
higher
slopes
after
the
mules
had
rested
the
guide
now
decided
to
turn
to
the
left
instead
of
going
straight
toward
the
mountain
a
dispute
ensued
as
to
how
much
he
knew
even
about
the
foot
of
coropuna
he
denied
that
there
were
any
huts
whatever
in
the
canyon
abandonado
despoblado
desierto
a
waste
a
solitude
a
wilderness
so
he
described
it
had
he
been
there
no
señor
luckily
we
had
been
able
to
make
out
from
the
rim
of
the
canyon
two
or
three
huts
near
a
little
stream
as
there
was
no
question
that
we
ought
to
get
to
the
snow
line
as
soon
as
possible
we
decided
to
dispense
with
the
services
of
so
a
guide
and
make
such
way
as
we
could
alone
the
altitude
of
the
rim
of
the
canyon
was
feet
the
mules
showed
signs
of
acute
distress
from
mountain
sickness
the
arrieros
began
to
complain
loudly
but
did
what
they
could
to
relieve
the
mules
by
punching
holes
in
their
ears
the
theory
being
that
bloodletting
is
a
good
thing
for
soroche
as
soon
as
the
timid
arrieros
reached
a
point
where
they
could
see
down
into
the
canyon
they
spotted
some
patches
of
green
pasture
cheered
up
a
bit
and
even
smiled
over
the
dismal
ignorance
of
the
guide
soon
we
found
a
trail
which
led
to
the
huts
near
the
huts
was
a
taciturn
indian
woman
who
refused
to
furnish
us
with
either
fuel
or
forage
although
we
tried
to
pay
in
advance
and
offered
her
silver
nevertheless
we
proceeded
to
pitch
our
tents
and
took
advantage
of
the
sheltering
stone
wall
of
her
corral
for
our
camp
fire
after
peace
had
settled
down
and
it
became
perfectly
evident
that
we
were
harmless
the
door
of
one
of
the
huts
opened
and
an
indian
man
appeared
doubtless
the
cause
of
his
disappearance
before
our
arrival
had
been
the
easily
discernible
presence
in
our
midst
of
the
brass
buttons
of
corporal
gamarra
possibly
he
who
had
selected
this
remote
corner
of
the
wilderness
for
his
abode
had
a
guilty
conscience
and
at
the
sight
of
a
gendarme
decided
that
he
had
better
hide
at
once
more
probably
however
he
feared
the
visit
of
a
recruiting
party
since
it
is
quite
likely
that
he
had
not
served
his
legal
term
of
military
service
at
all
events
when
his
wife
discovered
that
we
were
not
looking
for
her
man
she
allowed
his
curiosity
to
overcome
his
fears
we
found
that
the
indians
kept
a
few
llamas
they
also
made
crude
pottery
firing
it
with
straw
and
llama
dung
they
lived
almost
entirely
on
gruel
made
from
chuño
frozen
bitter
potatoes
little
else
than
potatoes
will
grow
at
feet
above
the
sea
for
neighbors
the
indians
had
a
solitary
old
man
who
lived
half
a
mile
up
nearer
the
glaciers
and
a
small
family
a
mile
and
a
half
down
the
valley
before
dark
the
neighbors
came
to
call
and
we
tried
our
best
to
persuade
the
men
to
accompany
us
up
the
mountain
and
help
to
carry
the
loads
from
the
point
where
the
mules
would
have
to
stop
but
they
declined
absolutely
and
positively
i
think
one
of
the
men
might
have
gone
but
as
soon
as
his
quiet
wife
saw
him
wavering
she
broke
out
in
a
torrent
of
violent
denunciation
telling
him
the
mountain
would
eat
him
up
and
that
unless
he
wanted
to
go
to
heaven
before
his
time
he
had
better
let
well
enough
alone
and
stay
where
he
was
cieza
de
leon
one
of
the
most
careful
of
the
early
chroniclers
says
that
at
coropuna
the
devil
talks
more
freely
than
usual
for
some
secret
reason
known
to
god
it
is
said
that
devils
walk
visibly
about
in
that
place
and
that
the
indians
see
them
and
are
much
terrified
i
have
also
heard
that
these
devils
have
appeared
to
christians
in
the
form
of
indians
perhaps
the
voluble
housewife
was
herself
one
of
the
famous
coropuna
devils
she
certainly
talked
more
freely
than
usual
or
possibly
she
thought
that
the
coropuna
devils
were
now
appearing
to
indians
in
the
form
of
christians
anyhow
the
indians
said
that
on
top
of
coropuna
there
was
a
delightful
warm
paradise
containing
beautiful
flowers
luscious
fruits
parrots
of
brilliant
plumage
macaws
and
even
monkeys
those
faithful
denizens
of
hot
climates
the
souls
of
the
departed
stop
to
rest
and
enjoy
themselves
in
this
charming
spot
on
their
upward
flight
like
most
primitive
people
who
live
near
mountains
they
had
an
abject
terror
of
the
forbidding
summits
and
the
snowstorms
that
seem
to
come
down
from
them
probably
the
indians
hope
to
propitiate
the
demons
who
dwell
on
the
mountain
tops
by
inventing
charming
stories
relating
to
their
abode
it
is
interesting
to
learn
that
in
the
neighboring
hamlet
of
pampacolca
the
great
explorer
raimondi
in
found
the
natives
exiled
from
the
civilized
world
still
preserving
their
primitive
customs
carrying
idols
to
the
slopes
of
the
great
snow
mountain
coropuna
and
there
offering
them
as
a
sacrifice
apparently
the
mountain
still
inspires
fear
in
the
hearts
of
all
those
who
live
near
it
the
fact
that
we
agreed
to
pay
in
advance
wages
ten
times
the
usual
amount
earned
by
laborers
in
this
vicinity
that
we
added
offers
of
the
precious
coca
leaves
the
the
rarely
seen
tobacco
and
other
good
things
usually
coveted
by
peruvian
highlanders
had
no
effect
in
the
face
of
the
terrors
of
the
mountain
they
knew
only
too
well
that
was
one
of
the
least
of
ills
to
be
encountered
while
the
advantages
of
glasses
warm
clothes
kerosene
stoves
and
plenty
of
good
food
which
we
freely
offered
were
far
too
remote
from
the
realm
of
credible
possibilities
professor
coello
understood
all
these
matters
perfectly
and
being
able
to
speak
quichua
the
language
of
our
prospective
carriers
did
his
best
in
the
way
of
argument
not
only
out
of
loyalty
to
the
expedition
but
because
peruvian
gentlemen
always
regard
the
carrying
of
a
load
as
extremely
undignified
and
improper
i
have
known
one
of
the
most
energetic
and
efficient
business
men
in
peru
a
highly
respected
gentleman
in
a
mountain
city
so
to
dislike
being
obliged
to
carry
a
rolled
and
unmounted
photograph
little
larger
than
a
lead
pencil
that
he
sent
for
a
cargador
an
indian
porter
to
bear
it
for
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
professor
coello
was
perfectly
willing
to
do
his
share
and
more
but
neither
he
nor
we
were
anxious
to
climb
with
heavy
packs
on
our
backs
in
the
rarefied
air
of
elevations
several
thousand
feet
higher
than
mont
blanc
the
argument
with
the
indians
was
long
and
verbose
and
the
offerings
of
money
and
goods
were
made
more
and
more
generous
all
was
in
vain
we
finally
came
to
realize
that
whatever
supplies
and
provisions
were
carried
up
coropuna
would
have
to
be
borne
on
our
own
shoulders
that
evening
the
top
of
the
truncated
dome
which
was
just
visible
from
the
valley
near
our
camp
was
bathed
in
a
roseate
alpine
glow
unspeakably
beautiful
the
air
however
was
very
bitter
and
the
neighboring
brook
froze
solid
during
the
night
the
gendarme
mule
became
homesick
and
disappeared
with
coello
horse
gamarra
was
sent
to
look
for
the
strays
with
orders
to
follow
us
as
soon
as
possible
as
no
bearers
or
carriers
were
to
be
secured
it
was
essential
to
persuade
the
tejadas
to
take
their
pack
mules
up
as
far
as
the
snow
a
feat
they
declined
to
do
the
mules
don
pablo
said
had
already
gone
as
far
as
and
farther
than
mules
had
any
business
to
go
soon
after
reaching
camp
tucker
had
gone
off
on
a
reconnaissance
he
reported
that
there
was
a
path
leading
out
of
the
canyon
up
to
the
llama
pastures
on
the
lower
slopes
of
the
mountains
the
arrieros
denied
the
accuracy
of
his
observations
however
after
a
long
argument
they
agreed
to
go
as
far
as
there
was
a
good
path
and
no
farther
there
was
no
question
of
our
riding
it
was
simply
a
case
of
getting
the
loads
as
high
up
as
possible
before
we
had
to
begin
to
carry
them
ourselves
it
may
be
imagined
that
the
arrieros
packed
very
slowly
and
grudgingly
although
the
loads
were
now
considerably
reduced
finally
leaving
behind
our
saddles
ordinary
supplies
and
everything
not
considered
absolutely
necessary
for
a
two
weeks
stay
on
the
mountain
we
set
off
we
could
easily
walk
faster
than
the
loaded
mules
and
thought
it
best
to
avoid
trouble
by
keeping
far
enough
ahead
so
as
not
to
hear
the
arrieros
constant
complaints
after
an
hour
of
not
very
hard
climbing
over
a
fairly
good
llama
trail
the
tejadas
stopped
at
the
edge
of
the
pastures
and
shouted
to
us
to
come
back
we
replied
equally
vociferously
calling
them
to
come
ahead
which
they
did
for
half
an
hour
more
slowly
zigzagging
up
a
slope
of
coarse
black
volcanic
sand
then
they
not
only
stopped
but
commenced
to
unload
the
mules
it
was
necessary
to
rush
back
and
commence
a
violent
and
acrimonious
dispute
as
to
whether
the
letter
of
the
contract
had
been
fulfilled
and
the
mules
had
gone
as
far
as
they
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
go
the
truth
was
the
tejadas
were
terrified
at
approaching
mysterious
coropuna
they
were
sure
it
would
take
revenge
on
them
by
destroying
their
mules
who
would
certainly
die
the
following
day
of
soroche
we
offered
a
bonus
of
thirty
soles
fifteen
dollars
if
they
would
go
on
for
another
hour
and
threatened
them
with
all
sorts
of
things
if
they
would
not
at
last
they
readjusted
the
loads
and
started
climbing
again
the
altitude
was
now
about
feet
but
at
the
foot
of
a
steep
little
rise
the
arrieros
stopped
again
this
time
they
succeeded
in
unloading
two
mules
before
we
could
scramble
down
over
the
sand
and
boulders
to
stop
them
threats
and
prayers
were
now
of
no
avail
the
only
thing
that
would
satisfy
was
a
legal
document
they
demanded
an
agreement
in
writing
that
in
case
any
mule
or
mules
died
as
a
result
of
this
foolish
attempt
to
get
up
to
the
snow
line
i
should
pay
in
gold
two
hundred
soles
for
each
and
every
mule
that
died
further
i
must
agree
to
pay
a
bonus
of
fifty
soles
if
they
would
keep
climbing
until
noon
or
until
stopped
by
snow
this
document
having
been
duly
drawn
up
by
professor
coello
seated
on
a
lava
rock
amidst
the
cinders
of
the
old
volcano
was
duly
signed
and
sealed
in
order
that
there
might
be
no
dispute
as
to
the
time
my
best
chronometer
was
handed
over
to
pablo
tejada
to
carry
until
noon
the
mules
were
reloaded
and
again
the
ascent
began
presently
the
mules
encountered
some
pretty
bad
going
on
a
steep
slope
covered
with
huge
lava
boulders
and
scoriaceous
sand
we
expected
more
trouble
every
minute
however
the
arrieros
having
made
an
advantageous
bargain
did
their
best
to
carry
it
out
fortunately
the
mules
reached
the
snow
line
just
fifteen
minutes
before
twelve
the
tejadas
lost
no
time
in
unloading
claimed
their
bonus
promised
to
return
in
ten
days
and
almost
before
we
knew
it
had
disappeared
down
the
side
of
the
mountain
we
spent
the
afternoon
establishing
our
base
camp
we
had
three
tents
the
mummery
a
very
light
and
diminutive
wall
tent
about
four
feet
high
made
by
edgington
of
london
an
ordinary
wall
tent
by
of
fairly
heavy
material
with
floor
sewed
in
and
an
improved
pyramidal
tent
made
by
david
abercrombie
but
designed
by
tucker
after
one
used
on
mt
mckinley
by
professor
parker
tucker
tent
had
two
openings
a
small
vent
in
the
top
of
the
pyramid
capable
of
being
closed
by
an
adjustable
cap
in
case
of
storm
and
an
oval
entrance
through
which
one
had
to
crawl
this
opening
could
be
closed
to
any
desired
extent
with
a
pucker
string
a
fairly
heavy
waterproof
floor
measuring
by
was
sewed
to
the
base
of
the
pyramid
so
that
a
single
pole
without
guy
ropes
was
all
that
was
necessary
to
keep
the
tent
upright
after
the
floor
had
been
securely
pegged
to
the
ground
or
snow
tucker
tent
offered
the
advantages
of
being
carried
without
difficulty
easily
erected
by
one
man
readily
ventilated
and
yet
giving
shelter
to
four
men
in
any
weather
we
proposed
to
leave
the
wall
tent
at
the
base
but
to
take
the
pyramidal
tent
with
us
on
the
climb
we
determined
to
carry
the
mummery
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
to
use
while
taking
observations
the
elevation
of
the
base
camp
was
feet
we
were
surprised
and
pleased
to
find
that
at
first
we
had
good
appetites
and
no
soroche
less
than
a
hundred
yards
from
the
wall
tent
was
a
small
diurnal
stream
fed
by
melting
snow
whenever
i
went
to
get
water
for
cooking
or
washing
purposes
i
noticed
a
startling
and
rapid
rise
in
pulse
and
increasing
shortness
of
breath
my
normal
pulse
is
after
i
walked
slowly
a
hundred
feet
on
a
level
at
this
altitude
it
rose
to
after
i
had
been
seated
awhile
it
dropped
down
to
gradually
our
sense
of
departed
and
was
followed
by
a
feeling
of
malaise
and
general
disability
there
was
a
splendid
sunset
but
we
were
too
sick
and
cold
to
enjoy
it
that
night
all
slept
badly
and
had
some
headache
a
high
wind
swept
around
the
mountain
and
threatened
to
carry
away
both
of
our
tents
as
we
lay
awake
wondering
at
what
moment
we
should
find
ourselves
deserted
by
the
frail
canvas
shelters
we
could
not
help
thinking
that
coropuna
was
giving
us
a
fair
warning
of
what
might
happen
higher
up
figure
the
base
camp
coropuna
at
feet
figure
camping
at
feet
on
the
slopes
of
coropuna
for
breakfast
we
had
pemmican
pea
soup
and
tea
we
all
wanted
plenty
of
sugar
in
our
tea
and
drank
large
quantities
of
it
experience
on
mt
mckinley
had
led
tucker
to
believe
heartily
in
the
advantages
of
pemmican
a
food
especially
prepared
for
arctic
explorers
neither
coello
nor
gamarra
nor
i
had
ever
tasted
it
before
we
decided
that
it
is
not
very
palatable
on
first
acquaintance
although
doubtless
of
great
value
when
one
has
to
spend
long
periods
of
time
in
the
arctic
where
even
seal
blubber
is
a
delicacy
as
good
as
cow
cream
i
presume
we
could
have
done
just
as
well
without
it
it
was
decided
to
carry
with
us
from
the
base
enough
fuel
and
supplies
to
last
through
any
possible
misadventure
even
of
a
duration
accounts
of
climbs
in
the
high
andes
are
full
of
failures
due
to
the
necessity
of
the
explorers
being
obliged
to
return
to
food
warmth
and
shelter
before
having
effected
the
conquest
of
a
new
peak
one
remembers
the
frequent
disappointments
that
came
to
such
intrepid
climbers
as
whymper
in
ecuador
martin
conway
in
bolivia
and
fitzgerald
in
chile
and
argentina
due
to
high
winds
the
sudden
advent
of
terrific
snowstorms
and
the
weakness
caused
by
soroche
at
the
cost
of
carrying
loads
we
determined
to
try
to
avoid
being
obliged
to
turn
back
we
could
only
hope
that
no
unforeseen
event
would
finally
defeat
our
efforts
tucker
decided
to
establish
a
cache
of
food
and
fuel
as
far
up
the
mountain
side
as
he
and
coello
could
carry
fifty
pounds
in
a
single
day
climb
leaving
me
to
reset
the
demoralized
tents
and
do
other
chores
they
started
off
packing
loads
of
about
pounds
each
to
me
their
progress
up
the
mountain
side
seemed
extraordinarily
slow
were
they
never
going
to
get
anywhere
their
frequent
stops
seemed
ludicrous
i
was
to
learn
later
that
it
is
as
difficult
at
a
high
elevation
for
one
who
is
not
climbing
to
have
any
sympathy
for
those
suffering
from
soroche
as
it
is
for
a
sailor
to
appreciate
the
sensations
of
one
who
is
seasick
during
the
morning
i
set
up
the
barometers
and
took
a
series
of
observations
it
was
pleasant
to
note
that
the
two
new
mountain
aneroids
registered
exactly
alike
all
the
different
units
of
the
cargo
that
was
to
be
taken
up
the
mountain
then
had
to
be
weighed
so
that
they
might
be
equitably
distributed
in
our
loads
the
following
day
we
had
two
small
kerosene
stoves
with
primus
burners
our
grub
ordered
months
before
specially
for
this
climb
consisted
of
pemmican
in
tins
kola
chocolate
in
tins
seeded
raisins
in
tins
cube
sugar
in
tins
in
tins
jam
sticks
of
dried
pea

plasmon
biscuit
tea
and
a
few
of
silver
messtins
containing

corporal
gamarra
appeared
during
the
day
having
found
his
mule
which
had
strayed
twelve
miles
down
the
canyon
he
did
not
relish
the
prospect
of
climbing
coropuna
but
when
he
saw
the
warm
clothes
which
we
had
provided
for
him
and
learned
that
he
would
get
a
bonus
of
five
gold
sovereigns
on
top
of
the
mountain
he
decided
to
accept
his
duties
philosophically
tucker
and
coello
returned
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
reported
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
serious
difficulties
in
the
first
part
of
the
climb
and
that
a
cache
had
been
established
about
feet
above
the
base
camp
on
a
snow
field
tucker
now
assigned
our
packs
for
the
morrow
and
skillfully
prepared
the
and
harness
with
which
we
were
to
carry
them
notwithstanding
an
unusual
headache
which
lasted
all
day
long
i
still
had
some
appetite
our
supper
consisted
of
pemmican
pudding
with
raisins
and
pea
soup
which
every
one
was
able
to
eat
if
not
to
enjoy
that
night
we
slept
better
one
reason
being
that
the
wind
did
not
blow
as
hard
as
it
had
the
night
before
the
weather
continued
fine
watkins
was
due
to
arrive
from
arequipa
in
a
day
or
two
but
we
decided
not
to
wait
for
him
or
run
any
further
risk
of
encountering
an
early
summer
snowstorm
the
next
morning
after
adjusting
our
loads
to
our
unaccustomed
backs
we
left
camp
about
nine
we
wore
appalachian
mountain
club
or
crampons
heavy
scotch
mittens
knit
woolen
helmets
dark
blue
and
very
heavy
clothing
it
will
be
remembered
by
visitors
to
the
zermatt
museum
that
the
swiss
guides
who
once
climbed
huascaran
in
the
northern
peruvian
andes
had
been
maimed
for
life
by
their
experiences
in
the
deep
snows
of
those
great
altitudes
we
determined
to
take
no
chances
and
in
order
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
each
man
was
ordered
to
put
on
four
pairs
of
heavy
woolen
socks
and
two
or
three
pairs
of
heavy
underdrawers
professor
coello
and
corporal
gamarra
wore
large
heavy
boots
i
had
woolen
puttees
and
arctic
overshoes
tucker
improvised
what
he
regarded
as
highly
satisfactory
sandals
out
of
felt
slippers
and
pieces
of
a
rubber
poncho
since
there
seemed
to
be
no
ahead
of
us
we
decided
to
depend
on
crampons
rather
than
on
the
heavy
climbing
boots
with
which
alpinists
are
familiar
the
snow
was
very
hard
until
about
one
by
three
it
was
so
soft
as
to
make
further
progress
impossible
we
found
that
loaded
as
we
were
we
could
not
climb
a
gentle
rise
faster
than
twenty
steps
at
a
time
on
the
more
level
snow
fields
we
took
or
thirty
steps
before
stopping
to
rest
at
the
end
of
each
stint
it
seemed
as
though
they
would
be
the
last
steps
we
should
ever
take
panting
violently
fatigued
beyond
belief
and
overcome
with
we
would
stop
and
lean
on
our
ice
axes
until
able
to
take
steps
more
it
did
not
take
very
long
to
recover
one
wind
finally
we
reached
a
glacier
marked
by
a
network
of
crevasses
none
very
wide
and
nearly
all
covered
with
we
were
roped
together
and
although
there
was
an
occasional
fall
no
great
strain
was
put
on
the
rope
then
came
great
snow
fields
with
not
a
single
crevasse
for
the
most
part
our
day
was
simply
an
unending
succession
of
stints
steps
and
a
rest
repeated
four
or
five
times
and
followed
by
steps
and
a
longer
rest
taken
lying
down
in
the
snow
we
pegged
along
until
about
two
when
the
rapidly
melting
snow
stopped
all
progress
at
an
altitude
of
about
feet
the
tucker
tent
was
pitched
on
a
fairly
level
snow
field
we
now
noticed
with
dismay
that
the
two
big
aneroids
had
begun
to
differ
as
the
sun
declined
the
temperature
fell
rapidly
at
five
the
thermometer
stood
at
during
the
night
the
minimum
thermometer
registered
we
noticed
a
considerable
number
of
lightning
flashes
in
the
northeast
they
were
not
accompanied
by
any
thunder
but
alarmed
us
considerably
we
feared
the
expected
november
storms
might
be
ahead
of
time
we
closed
the
tent
door
on
account
of
a
biting
wind
owing
to
the
ventilating
device
at
the
top
of
the
tent
we
managed
to
breathe
fairly
well
mountain
climbers
at
high
altitudes
have
occasionally
observed
that
one
of
the
symptoms
of
acute
soroche
is
a
very
annoying
racking
cough
as
violent
as
whooping
cough
and
frequently
accompanied
by
nausoa
we
had
not
experienced
this
at
feet
but
now
it
began
to
be
painfully
noticeable
and
continued
during
the
ensuing
days
and
nights
particularly
nights
until
we
got
back
to
the
huts
again
we
slept
very
poorly
and
continually
awakened
one
another
by
coughing
the
next
morning
we
had
very
little
appetite
no
ambition
and
a
miserable
sense
of
malaise
and
great
fatigue
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
shoulder
our
packs
arrange
our
and
proceed
with
the
same
steady
drudgery
now
a
little
harder
than
the
day
before
we
broke
camp
at
seven
and
by
noon
had
reached
an
altitude
of
about
feet
on
a
snow
field
within
a
mile
of
the
saddle
between
the
great
truncated
peak
and
the
rest
of
the
range
it
looked
possible
to
reach
the
summit
in
one
more
day
climb
from
here
the
aneroids
now
differed
by
over
five
hundred
feet
leaving
me
to
pitch
the
tent
the
others
went
back
to
the
cache
to
bring
up
some
of
the
supplies
due
to
the
fact
that
we
were
carrying
loads
twice
as
heavy
as
those
which
tucker
and
coello
had
first
brought
up
we
had
not
passed
their
cache
until
by
the
time
my
companions
appeared
again
i
was
so
completely
rested
that
i
marveled
at
the
pace
they
made
over
the
nearly
level
snow
field
it
seemed
incredible
that
they
should
find
it
necessary
to
rest
four
times
after
they
were
within
one
hundred
yards
of
the
camp
we
were
none
of
us
hungry
that
evening
we
craved
sweet
tea
before
turning
in
for
the
night
we
took
the
trouble
to
melt
snow
and
make
a
potful
of
tea
which
could
be
warmed
up
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
we
passed
another
very
bad
night
the
thermometer
registered
but
we
did
not
suffer
from
the
cold
in
fact
when
you
stow
away
four
men
on
the
floor
of
a
by
tent
they
are
obliged
to
sleep
so
close
together
as
to
keep
warm
furthermore
each
man
had
an
eiderdown
blankets
and
plenty
of
heavy
clothes
and
sweaters
we
did
however
suffer
from
soroche
violent
whooping
cough
assailed
us
at
frequent
intervals
none
of
us
slept
much
i
amused
myself
by
counting
my
pulse
occasionally
only
to
find
that
it
persistently
refused
to
go
below
and
if
i
moved
would
jump
up
to
i
know
where
it
went
on
the
actual
climb
so
far
as
i
could
determine
it
did
not
go
below
for
four
days
and
nights
on
the
morning
of
october
we
got
up
at
three
hot
sweet
tea
was
the
one
thing
we
all
craved
the
was
found
to
be
frozen
solid
although
it
had
been
hung
up
in
the
tent
it
took
an
hour
to
thaw
and
the
tea
was
just
warm
enough
for
practical
purposes
when
i
made
an
awkward
move
in
the
crowded
tent
and
kicked
over
the
never
did
men
keep
their
tempers
better
under
more
aggravating
circumstances
not
a
word
of
reproach
or
indignation
greeted
my
clumsy
accident
although
poor
corporal
gamarra
who
was
lying
on
the
down
side
of
the
tent
had
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
into
the
colder
but
somewhat
drier
weather
outside
my
clumsiness
necessitated
a
delay
of
nearly
an
hour
in
starting
while
we
were
melting
more
frozen
snow
and
the
tea
we
warmed
up
some
pea
soup
and
irish
stew
tucker
and
i
managed
to
eat
a
little
coello
and
gamarra
had
no
stomachs
for
anything
but
tea
we
decided
to
leave
the
tucker
tent
at
the
foot
level
together
with
most
of
our
outfit
and
provisions
from
here
to
the
top
we
were
to
carry
only
such
things
as
were
absolutely
necessary
they
included
the
mummery
tent
with
pegs
and
poles
the
barometer
the
two
watkins
aneroids
the
hypsometer
a
pair
of
zeiss
glasses
two
kodaks
six
films
a
sling
psychrometer
a
prismatic
compass
and
clinometer
a
stanley
pocket
level
an
mountain
rope
three
ice
axes
a
flagpole
an
american
flag
and
a
yale
flag
in
order
to
avoid
disaster
in
case
of
storm
we
also
carried
four
of
silver
cans
of
irish
stew
and
soup
a
cake
of
chocolate
and
eight
besides
raisins
and
cubes
of
sugar
in
our
pockets
our
loads
weighed
about
twenty
pounds
each
to
our
great
satisfaction
and
relief
the
weather
continued
fine
and
there
was
very
little
wind
on
the
preceding
afternoon
the
snow
had
been
so
soft
one
frequently
went
in
over
one
knees
but
now
everything
was
frozen
hard
we
left
camp
at
five
it
was
still
dark
the
great
dome
of
coropuna
loomed
up
on
our
left
cut
off
from
direct
attack
by
gigantic
ice
falls
to
reach
it
we
must
first
surmount
the
saddle
on
the
main
ridge
from
there
an
apparently
unbroken
slope
extended
to
the
top
our
progress
was
distressingly
slow
even
with
the
light
loads
when
we
reached
the
saddle
there
came
a
painful
surprise
to
the
north
of
us
loomed
a
great
snowy
cone
the
peak
which
we
had
at
first
noticed
from
the
chuquibamba
calvario
now
it
actually
looked
higher
than
the
dome
we
were
about
to
climb
from
the
sihuas
desert
eighty
miles
away
the
dome
had
certainly
seemed
to
be
the
highest
point
so
we
stuck
to
our
task
although
constantly
facing
the
possibility
that
our
painful
labors
might
be
in
vain
and
that
eventually
this
north
peak
would
prove
to
be
higher
we
began
to
doubt
whether
we
should
have
strength
enough
for
both
loss
of
sleep
soroche
and
lack
of
appetite
were
rapidly
undermining
our
endurance
the
last
slope
had
an
inclination
of
thirty
degrees
we
should
have
had
to
cut
steps
with
our
ice
axes
all
the
way
up
had
it
not
been
for
our
which
worked
splendidly
as
it
was
not
more
than
a
dozen
or
fifteen
steps
actually
had
to
be
cut
even
in
the
steepest
part
tucker
was
first
on
the
rope
i
was
second
coello
third
and
gamarra
brought
up
the
rear
we
were
not
a
very
gay
party
the
high
altitude
was
sapping
all
our
ambition
i
found
that
an
occasional
lump
of
sugar
acted
as
the
best
rapid
restorative
to
sagging
spirits
it
was
astonishing
how
quickly
the
carbon
in
the
sugar
was
absorbed
by
the
system
and
came
to
the
relief
of
smoldering
bodily
fires
a
single
cube
gave
new
strength
and
vigor
for
several
minutes
of
course
one
could
not
eat
sugar
without
limit
but
it
did
help
to
tide
over
difficult
places
we
zigzagged
slowly
up
hour
after
hour
alternately
resting
and
climbing
until
we
were
about
to
reach
what
seemed
to
be
the
top
obviously
alas
not
as
high
as
our
enemy
to
the
north
just
then
tucker
gave
a
great
shout
the
rest
of
us
were
too
much
out
of
breath
to
ask
him
why
he
was
wasting
his
strength
shouting
when
at
last
we
painfully
came
to
the
edge
of
what
looked
like
the
summit
we
saw
the
cause
of
his
joy
there
immediately
ahead
of
us
lay
another
slope
three
hundred
feet
higher
than
where
we
were
standing
it
may
seem
strange
that
in
our
weakened
condition
we
should
have
been
glad
to
find
that
we
had
three
hundred
feet
more
to
climb
remember
however
that
all
the
morning
we
had
been
gazing
with
dread
at
that
aggravating
north
peak
whenever
we
had
had
a
moment
to
give
to
the
consideration
of
anything
but
the
immediate
difficulties
of
our
climb
our
hearts
had
sunk
within
us
at
the
thought
that
possibly
after
all
we
might
find
the
north
peak
higher
the
fact
that
there
lay
before
us
another
three
hundred
feet
which
would
undoubtedly
take
us
above
the
highest
point
of
that
aggravating
north
peak
was
so
very
much
the
less
of
two
possible
evils
that
we
understood
tucker
shout
yet
none
of
us
was
lusty
enough
to
echo
it
with
faint
smiles
and
renewed
courage
we
pegged
along
resting
on
our
ice
axes
as
usual
every
steps
until
at
last
at
eleven
after
six
hours
and
a
half
of
climbing
from
the
camp
we
reached
the
culminating
point
of
coropuna
as
we
approached
it
tucker
although
naturally
much
elated
at
having
successfully
engineered
the
first
ascent
of
this
great
mountain
stopped
and
with
extraordinary
courtesy
and
smilingly
motioned
me
to
go
ahead
in
order
that
the
director
of
the
expedition
might
be
actually
the
first
person
to
reach
the
culminating
point
in
order
to
appreciate
how
great
a
sacrifice
he
was
willing
to
make
it
should
be
stated
that
his
willingness
to
come
on
the
expedition
was
due
chiefly
to
a
fondness
for
mountain
climbing
and
his
desire
to
add
coropuna
to
his
sheaf
of
victories
greatly
as
i
appreciated
his
kindness
in
making
way
for
me
i
could
only
acquiesce
in
so
far
as
to
continue
the
climb
by
his
side
we
reached
the
top
together
and
sank
down
to
rest
and
look
about
figure
the
camp
on
the
summit
of
coropuna
elevation
feet
figure
one
of
the
frequent
rests
in
the
ascent
of
coropuna
the
truncated
summit
is
an
snow
field
almost
flat
having
an
area
of
nearly
half
an
acre
about
feet
north
and
south
and
feet
east
and
west
if
it
once
were
as
we
suppose
a
volcanic
crater
the
pit
had
long
since
been
filled
up
with
snow
and
ice
there
were
no
rocks
to
be
seen
on
the
rim
only
the
hard
crust
of
the
glistening
white
surface
the
view
from
the
top
was
desolate
in
the
extreme
we
were
in
the
midst
of
a
great
volcanic
desert
dotted
with
isolated
peaks
covered
with
snow
and
occasional
glaciers
not
an
atom
of
green
was
to
be
seen
anywhere
apparently
we
stood
on
top
of
a
dead
world
mountain
climbers
in
the
andes
have
frequently
spoken
of
seeing
condors
at
great
altitudes
we
saw
none
northwest
twenty
miles
away
across
the
pampa
colorada
a
reddish
desert
rose
solimana
in
the
other
direction
we
looked
along
the
range
of
coropuna
itself
several
of
the
lesser
peaks
being
only
a
few
hundred
feet
below
our
elevation
far
to
the
southwest
we
imagined
we
could
see
the
faint
blue
of
the
pacific
ocean
but
it
was
very
dim
my
father
was
an
ardent
mountain
climber
glorying
not
only
in
the
difficulties
of
the
ascent
but
particularly
in
the
satisfaction
coming
from
the
magnificent
view
to
be
obtained
at
the
top
his
zeal
had
led
him
once
in
winter
to
ascend
the
highest
peak
in
the
pacific
mauna
kea
on
hawaii
he
taught
me
as
a
boy
to
be
fond
of
climbing
the
mountains
of
oahu
and
maui
and
to
be
appreciative
of
the
views
which
could
be
obtained
by
such
expenditure
of
effort
yet
now
i
could
not
take
the
least
interest
or
pleasure
in
the
view
from
the
top
of
coropuna
nor
could
my
companions
no
sense
of
satisfaction
in
having
attained
a
difficult
objective
cheered
us
up
we
all
felt
greatly
depressed
and
said
little
although
gamarra
asked
for
his
bonus
and
regarded
the
gold
coins
with
grim
complacency
after
we
had
rested
awhile
we
began
to
take
observations
unslinging
the
aneroid
which
i
had
been
carrying
i
found
to
my
surprise
and
dismay
that
the
needle
showed
a
height
of
only
feet
above
sea
level
tucker
aneroid
read
more
than
a
thousand
feet
higher
feet
but
even
this
fell
short
of
raimondi
estimate
of
feet
and
considerably
below
bandelier
feet
this
was
a
keen
disappointment
for
we
had
hoped
that
the
aneroids
would
at
least
show
a
margin
over
the
altitude
of
mt
aconcagua
feet
this
discovery
served
to
dampen
our
spirits
still
further
we
took
what
comfort
we
could
from
the
fact
that
the
aneroids
which
had
checked
each
other
perfectly
up
to
feet
were
now
so
obviously
untrustworthy
we
could
only
hope
that
both
might
prove
to
be
inaccurate
as
actually
happened
and
that
both
might
now
be
reading
too
low
anyhow
the
north
peak
did
look
lower
than
we
were
to
satisfy
any
doubts
on
this
subject
tucker
took
the
wooden
box
in
which
we
had
brought
the
hypsometer
laid
it
on
the
snow
leveled
it
up
carefully
with
the
stanley
pocket
level
and
took
a
squint
over
it
toward
the
north
peak
he
smiled
and
said
nothing
so
each
of
us
in
turn
lay
down
in
the
snow
and
took
a
squint
it
was
all
right
we
were
at
least
feet
higher
than
that
aggravating
peak
we
were
also
feet
higher
than
the
east
peak
of
coropuna
and
a
thousand
feet
higher
than
any
other
mountain
in
sight
at
any
rate
we
should
not
have
to
call
upon
our
strength
for
any
more
hard
climbs
in
the
immediate
future
after
arriving
at
this
satisfactory
conclusion
we
pitched
the
little
mummery
tent
set
up
the
tripod
for
the
mercurial
barometer
arranged
the
boiling
point
thermometer
with
its
apparatus
and
with
the
aid
of
kodaks
and
notebooks
proceeded
to
take
as
many
observations
as
possible
in
the
next
four
hours
at
two
we
read
the
mercurial
knowing
that
at
the
same
hour
readings
were
being
made
by
watkins
at
the
base
camp
and
by
the
harvard
astronomers
in
the
observatory
at
arequipa
the
barometer
was
suspended
from
a
tripod
set
up
in
the
shade
of
the
tent
the
mercury
which
at
sea
level
often
stands
at
inches
now
stood
at
inches
the
temperature
of
the
thermometer
on
the
barometer
was
exactly
at
the
same
time
inside
the
tent
we
got
the
water
to
boiling
and
took
a
reading
with
the
hypsometer
water
boils
at
sea
level
at
a
temperature
of
here
it
boiled
at
after
taking
the
reading
we
greedily
drank
the
water
which
had
been
heated
for
the
hypsometer
we
were
thirsty
enough
to
have
drunk
five
times
as
much
we
were
not
hungry
and
made
no
use
of
our
provisions
except
a
few
raisins
some
sugar
and
chocolate
after
completing
our
observations
we
fastened
the
little
tent
as
securely
as
possible
banking
the
snow
around
it
and
left
it
on
top
first
having
placed
in
it
one
of
the
appalachian
mountain
club
brass
record
cylinders
in
which
we
had
sealed
the
yale
flag
a
contemporary
map
of
peru
and
two
brief
statements
regarding
the
ascent
the
american
flag
was
left
flying
from
a
pole
which
we
planted
at
the
northwest
rim
of
the
dome
where
it
could
be
seen
from
the
road
to
cotahuasi
here
casimir
watkins
saw
it
a
week
later
and
isaiah
bowman
two
weeks
later
when
chief
topographer
hendriksen
arrived
three
weeks
later
to
make
his
survey
it
had
disappeared
probably
a
severe
storm
had
blown
it
over
and
buried
it
in
the
snow
we
left
the
summit
at
three
and
arrived
at
the
foot
camp
two
hours
and
fifteen
minutes
later
the
first
part
of
the
way
down
to
the
saddle
we
attempted
a
glissade
then
the
slope
grew
steeper
and
we
got
up
too
much
speed
for
comfort
so
we
finally
had
to
be
content
with
a
slower
method
of
locomotion
that
night
there
was
very
little
wind
mountain
climbers
have
more
to
fear
from
excessively
high
winds
than
almost
any
other
cause
we
were
very
lucky
nothing
occurred
to
interfere
with
the
best
progress
we
were
physically
capable
of
making
it
turned
out
that
we
did
not
need
to
have
brought
so
many
supplies
with
us
in
fact
it
is
an
open
question
whether
our
acute
would
have
permitted
us
to
outlast
a
long
storm
or
left
us
enough
appetite
to
use
the
provisions
although
one
does
get
accustomed
to
high
altitudes
we
felt
very
doubtful
no
one
in
the
western
hemisphere
had
ever
made
night
camps
at
feet
or
pitched
a
tent
as
high
as
the
summit
of
coropuna
the
severity
of
differs
greatly
in
different
localities
apparently
not
depending
entirely
on
the
altitude
i
do
not
know
how
long
we
could
have
stood
it
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
with
strength
enough
to
achieve
the
climb
we
should
have
felt
as
weak
and
ill
as
we
did
that
night
although
we
were
very
weary
none
of
us
slept
much
the
violent
whooping
cough
continued
and
all
of
us
were
nauseated
again
in
the
morning
we
felt
so
badly
and
were
able
to
take
so
little
nourishment
that
it
was
determined
to
get
to
a
lower
altitude
as
fast
as
possible
to
lighten
our
loads
we
left
behind
some
of
our
supplies
we
broke
camp
at
eighteen
minutes
later
without
having
to
rest
the
cache
was
reached
and
the
few
remnants
were
picked
up
although
many
things
had
been
abandoned
our
loads
seemed
heavier
than
ever
we
had
some
difficulty
in
negotiating
the
crevasses
but
gamarra
was
the
only
one
actually
to
fall
in
and
he
was
easily
pulled
out
again
about
noon
we
heard
a
faint
halloo
and
finally
made
out
two
animated
specks
far
down
the
mountain
side
the
effect
of
again
seeing
somebody
from
the
outside
world
was
rather
curious
i
had
a
choking
sensation
tucker
who
led
the
way
told
me
long
afterward
that
he
could
not
keep
the
tears
from
running
down
his
cheeks
although
we
did
not
see
it
at
the
time
the
specks
turned
out
to
be
watkins
and
an
indian
boy
who
came
up
as
high
as
was
safe
without
ropes
or
crampons
and
relieved
us
of
some
weight
the
base
camp
was
reached
at
twelve
one
of
the
first
things
tucker
did
on
returning
was
to
weigh
all
the
packs
to
my
surprise
and
disgust
i
learned
that
on
the
way
down
tucker
afraid
that
some
of
us
would
collapse
had
carried
pounds
and
gamarra
while
he
had
given
me
only
pounds
and
the
same
to
coello
this
of
course
does
not
include
the
weight
of
our
axes
or
rope
the
next
day
all
of
us
felt
very
tired
and
drowsy
in
fact
i
was
almost
overcome
with
inertia
it
was
a
fearful
task
even
to
lift
hand
the
sun
had
burned
our
faces
terribly
our
lips
were
painfully
swollen
we
coughed
and
whooped
it
seemed
best
to
make
every
effort
to
get
back
to
a
still
lower
altitude
for
the
mules
so
we
broke
camp
got
the
loads
ready
without
waiting
put
our
and
blankets
on
our
backs
and
went
rapidly
down
to
the
indians
huts
immediately
our
malaise
left
us
we
felt
physically
stronger
we
took
deep
breaths
as
though
we
had
gotten
back
to
sea
level
there
was
no
sensation
of
oppression
on
the
chest
yet
we
were
still
actually
higher
than
the
top
of
pike
peak
we
could
move
rapidly
about
without
getting
out
of
breath
the
aggravating
whooping
cough
left
us
and
our
appetites
returned
to
be
sure
we
still
suffered
from
the
effects
of
snow
and
sun
on
the
ascent
i
had
been
very
thirsty
and
foolishly
had
allowed
myself
to
eat
a
considerable
amount
of
snow
as
a
result
my
tongue
was
now
so
extremely
sensitive
that
pieces
of
soda
biscuit
tasted
like
broken
glass
corporal
gamarra
who
had
been
unwilling
to
keep
his
always
in
place
and
thought
to
relieve
his
eyes
by
frequently
dispensing
with
them
now
suffered
from
partial
the
rest
of
us
were
spared
any
inflammation
of
the
eyes
there
followed
two
days
of
resting
and
waiting
then
the
smiling
arrieros
surprised
and
delighted
at
seeing
us
alive
again
after
our
adventure
with
coropuna
arrived
with
our
mules
the
tejadas
gave
us
hearty
embraces
and
promptly
went
off
up
to
the
snow
line
to
get
the
loads
the
next
day
we
returned
to
chuquibamba
in
november
chief
topographer
hendriksen
completed
his
survey
and
found
the
latitude
of
coropuna
to
be
south
and
the
longitude
to
be
west
of
greenwich
he
computed
its
altitude
to
be
feet
above
sea
level
the
result
of
comparing
the
readings
of
our
mercurial
barometer
taken
at
the
summit
with
the
simultaneous
readings
taken
at
arequipa
gave
practically
the
same
figures
there
was
less
than
sixty
feet
difference
between
the
two
although
coropuna
proves
to
be
thirteen
hundred
feet
lower
than
bandelier
estimate
and
a
thousand
feet
lower
than
the
highest
mountain
in
south
america
still
it
is
a
thousand
feet
higher
than
the
highest
mountain
in
north
america
while
we
were
glad
we
were
the
first
to
reach
the
top
we
all
agreed
we
would
never
do
it
again
chapter
iii
to
parinacochas
after
a
few
days
in
the
delightful
climate
of
chuquibamba
we
set
out
for
parinacochas
the
flamingo
lake
of
the
incas
the
late
sir
clements
markham
literary
and
historical
successor
of
the
author
of
the
conquest
of
peru
had
called
attention
to
this
unexplored
lake
in
one
of
the
publications
of
the
royal
geographical
society
and
had
named
a
bathymetric
survey
of
parinacochas
as
one
of
the
principal
desiderata
for
future
exploration
in
peru
so
far
as
one
could
judge
from
the
published
maps
parinacochas
although
much
smaller
than
titicaca
was
the
largest
body
of
water
entirely
in
peru
a
thorough
search
of
geographical
literature
failed
to
reveal
anything
regarding
its
depth
the
only
thing
that
seemed
to
be
known
about
it
was
that
it
had
no
outlet
general
william
miller
once
british
consul
general
in
honolulu
who
had
as
a
young
man
assisted
general
san
martin
in
the
wars
for
the
independence
of
chile
and
peru
published
his
memoirs
in
london
in
during
the
campaigns
against
the
spanish
forces
in
peru
he
had
had
occasion
to
see
many
places
in
the
interior
on
one
of
his
rough
sketch
maps
he
indicates
the
location
of
lake
parinacochas
and
notes
the
fact
that
the
water
is
brackish
this
statement
of
general
miller
and
the
suggestion
of
sir
clements
markham
that
a
bathymetric
survey
of
the
lake
would
be
an
important
contribution
to
geographical
knowledge
was
all
that
we
were
able
to
learn
our
arrieros
the
tejadas
had
never
been
to
parinacochas
but
knew
in
a
general
way
its
location
and
were
not
afraid
to
try
to
get
there
some
of
their
friends
had
been
there
and
come
back
alive
first
however
it
was
necessary
for
us
to
go
to
cotahuasi
the
capital
of
the
province
of
antabamba
and
meet
dr
bowman
and
hendriksen
who
had
slowly
been
working
their
way
across
the
andes
from
the
urubamba
valley
and
who
would
need
a
new
supply
of
if
they
were
to
complete
the
geographical
reconnaissance
of
the
meridian
our
route
led
us
out
of
the
chuquibamba
valley
by
a
long
hard
climb
up
the
steep
cliffs
at
its
head
and
then
over
the
gently
sloping
desert
in
a
northerly
direction
around
the
west
flanks
of
coropuna
when
we
stopped
to
make
camp
that
night
on
the
pampa
of
chumpillo
our
arrieros
used
dried
moss
and
dung
for
fuel
for
the
camp
fire
there
was
some
and
there
were
llamas
pasturing
on
the
plains
near
our
tent
were
some
inca
ruins
probably
the
dwelling
of
a
shepherd
chief
or
possibly
the
remains
of
a
temple
described
by
cieza
de
leon
whose
remarkable
accounts
of
what
he
saw
and
learned
in
peru
during
the
time
of
the
pizarros
are
very
highly
regarded
he
says
that
among
the
five
most
important
temples
in
the
land
of
the
incas
was
one
much
venerated
and
frequented
by
them
named
coropuna
it
is
on
a
very
lofty
mountain
which
is
covered
with
snow
both
in
summer
and
winter
the
kings
of
peru
visited
this
temple
making
presents
and
offerings
it
is
held
for
certain
by
treasure
hunters
that
among
the
gifts
offered
to
this
temple
there
were
many
loads
of
silver
gold
and
precious
stones
buried
in
places
which
are
now
unknown
the
indians
concealed
another
great
sum
which
was
for
the
service
of
the
idol
and
of
the
priests
and
virgins
who
attended
upon
it
but
as
there
are
great
masses
of
snow
people
do
not
ascend
to
the
summit
nor
is
it
known
where
these
are
hidden
this
temple
possessed
many
flocks
farms
and
service
of
indians
no
one
lives
here
now
but
there
are
many
flocks
and
llamas
and
not
far
away
we
saw
ancient
storehouses
and
burial
places
that
night
we
suffered
from
intense
cold
and
were
kept
awake
by
the
bitter
wind
which
swept
down
from
the
snow
fields
of
coropuna
and
shook
the
walls
of
our
tent
violently
the
next
day
we
crossed
two
small
oases
little
gulches
watered
from
the
melting
snow
of
coropuna
here
there
was
an
abundance
of
peat
and
some
small
gnarled
trees
from
which
chuquibamba
derives
part
of
its
fuel
supply
we
climbed
slowly
around
the
lower
spurs
of
coropuna
into
a
bleak
desert
wilderness
of
lava
blocks
and
scoriaceous
sand
the
red
desert
or
pampa
colorada
it
is
for
the
most
part
between
and
feet
above
sea
level
and
is
bounded
on
the
northwest
by
the
canyon
of
the
rio
arma
feet
deep
where
we
made
our
camp
and
passed
a
more
agreeable
night
the
following
morning
we
climbed
out
again
on
the
farther
side
of
the
canyon
and
skirted
the
eastern
slopes
of
mt
solimana
soon
the
trail
turned
abruptly
to
the
left
away
from
our
old
friend
coropuna
we
wondered
how
long
ago
our
mountain
was
an
active
volcano
less
than
two
hundred
miles
south
of
here
are
live
peaks
like
el
misti
and
ubinas
which
still
smolder
occasionally
and
have
been
known
in
the
memory
of
man
to
give
forth
great
showers
of
cinders
covering
a
wide
area
possibly
not
so
very
long
ago
the
great
truncated
peak
of
coropuna
was
formed
by
a
last
flickering
of
the
ancient
fires
dr
bowman
says
that
the
greater
part
of
the
vast
accumulation
of
lavas
and
volcanic
cinders
in
this
vicinity
goes
far
back
to
a
period
preceding
the
last
glacial
epoch
the
enormous
amount
of
erosion
that
has
taken
place
in
the
adjacent
canyons
and
the
great
numbers
of
strata
composed
of
lava
flows
laid
bare
by
the
mighty
streams
of
the
glacial
period
all
point
to
this
conclusion
my
saddle
mule
was
one
of
those
cantankerous
beasts
that
are
gentle
enough
as
long
as
they
are
allowed
to
have
their
own
way
in
her
case
this
meant
that
she
was
happy
only
when
going
along
close
to
her
friends
in
the
caravan
if
reined
in
while
i
took
some
notes
she
became
very
restive
finally
whirling
around
plunging
and
kicking
contrariwise
no
amount
of
spurring
or
lashing
with
a
stout
quirt
availed
to
make
her
go
ahead
of
her
comrades
this
morning
i
was
particularly
anxious
to
get
a
picture
of
our
pack
train
jogging
steadily
along
over
the
desert
directly
away
from
coropuna
since
my
mule
would
not
gallop
ahead
i
had
to
dismount
run
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
ahead
of
the
rapidly
advancing
animals
and
take
the
picture
before
they
reached
me
we
were
now
at
an
elevation
of
feet
above
sea
level
yet
to
my
surprise
and
delight
i
found
that
it
was
relatively
as
easy
to
run
here
as
anywhere
so
accustomed
had
my
lungs
and
heart
become
to
very
rarefied
air
had
i
attempted
such
a
strenuous
feat
at
a
similar
altitude
before
climbing
coropuna
it
would
have
been
physically
impossible
any
one
who
has
tried
to
run
two
hundred
yards
at
three
miles
above
sea
level
will
understand
we
were
still
in
a
very
arid
region
mostly
coarse
black
sand
and
pebbles
with
typical
desert
shrubs
and
occasional
bunches
of
tough
grass
the
slopes
of
mt
solimana
on
our
left
were
fairly
well
covered
with
sparse
vegetation
among
the
bushes
we
saw
a
number
of
vicuñas
the
smallest
wild
camels
of
the
new
world
we
tried
in
vain
to
get
near
enough
for
a
photograph
they
were
extremely
timid
and
scampered
away
before
we
were
within
three
hundred
yards
seven
or
eight
miles
more
of
very
gradual
downward
slope
brought
us
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
to
the
brink
of
a
magnificent
canyon
the
densely
populated
valley
of
cotahuasi
the
walls
of
the
canyon
were
covered
with
innumerable
terraces
thousands
of
them
it
seemed
at
first
glance
as
though
every
available
spot
in
the
canyon
had
been
either
terraced
or
allotted
to
some
compact
little
village
one
could
count
more
than
a
score
of
towns
including
cotahuasi
itself
its
long
main
street
outlined
by
whitewashed
houses
as
we
zigzagged
down
into
the
canyon
our
road
led
us
past
hundreds
of
the
artificial
terraces
and
through
little
villages
of
thatched
huts
huddled
together
on
spurs
rescued
from
the
agriculture
after
spending
several
weeks
in
a
desert
region
where
only
the
narrow
valley
bottoms
showed
any
signs
of
cultivation
it
seemed
marvelous
to
observe
the
extent
to
which
terracing
had
been
carried
on
the
side
of
the
cotahuasi
valley
although
we
were
now
in
the
zone
of
light
annual
rains
it
was
evident
from
the
extraordinary
irrigation
system
that
agriculture
here
depends
very
largely
on
ability
to
bring
water
down
from
the
great
mountains
in
the
interior
most
of
the
terraces
and
irrigation
canals
were
built
centuries
ago
long
before
the
discovery
of
america
no
part
of
the
ancient
civilization
of
peru
has
been
more
admired
than
the
development
of
agriculture
cook
says
that
there
is
no
part
of
the
world
in
which
more
pains
have
been
taken
to
raise
crops
where
nature
made
it
hard
for
them
to
be
planted
in
other
countries
to
be
sure
we
find
reclamation
projects
where
irrigation
canals
serve
to
bring
water
long
distances
to
be
used
on
arid
but
fruitful
soil
we
also
find
great
fertilizer
factories
turning
out
according
to
proper
chemical
formula
the
needed
constituents
to
furnish
impoverished
soils
with
the
necessary
materials
for
plant
growth
we
find
man
overcoming
many
obstacles
in
the
way
of
transportation
in
order
to
reach
great
regions
where
nature
has
provided
fertile
fields
and
made
it
easy
to
raise
crops
nowhere
outside
of
peru
either
in
historic
or
prehistoric
times
does
one
find
farmers
spending
incredible
amounts
of
labor
in
actually
creating
arable
fields
besides
bringing
the
water
to
irrigate
them
and
the
guano
to
fertilize
them
yet
that
is
what
was
done
by
the
ancient
highlanders
of
peru
as
they
spread
over
a
country
in
which
the
arable
flat
land
was
usually
at
so
great
an
elevation
as
to
be
suitable
for
only
the
hardiest
of
root
crops
like
the
white
potato
and
the
oca
they
were
driven
to
use
narrow
valley
bottoms
and
steep
though
fertile
slopes
in
order
to
raise
the
precious
maize
and
many
of
the
other
temperate
and
tropical
plants
which
they
domesticated
for
food
and
medicinal
purposes
they
were
constantly
confronted
by
an
extraordinary
scarcity
of
soil
in
the
valley
bottoms
torrential
rivers
meandering
from
side
to
side
were
engaged
in
an
endless
endeavor
to
tear
away
the
arable
land
and
bear
it
off
to
the
sea
the
slopes
of
the
valleys
were
frequently
so
very
steep
as
to
discourage
the
most
ardent
modern
agriculturalist
the
farmer
might
wake
up
any
morning
to
find
that
a
heavy
rain
during
the
night
had
washed
away
a
large
part
of
his
carefully
planted
fields
consequently
there
was
developed
through
the
centuries
a
series
of
andenes
terraces
or
platforms
examination
of
the
ancient
andenes
discloses
the
fact
that
they
were
not
made
by
simply
hoeing
in
the
earth
from
the
hillside
back
of
a
carefully
constructed
stone
wall
the
space
back
of
the
walls
was
first
filled
in
with
coarse
rocks
clay
and
rubble
then
followed
smaller
rocks
pebbles
and
gravel
which
would
serve
to
drain
the
subsoil
finally
on
top
of
all
this
and
to
a
depth
of
eighteen
inches
or
so
was
laid
the
finest
soil
they
could
procure
the
result
was
the
best
possible
field
for
intensive
cultivation
it
seems
absolutely
unbelievable
that
such
an
immense
amount
of
pains
should
have
been
taken
for
such
relatively
small
results
the
need
must
have
been
very
great
in
many
cases
the
terraces
are
only
a
few
feet
wide
although
hundreds
of
yards
in
length
usually
they
follow
the
natural
contours
of
the
valley
sometimes
they
are
two
hundred
yards
wide
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
corn
barley
and
alfalfa
are
grown
on
the
terraces
cotahuasi
itself
lies
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
a
pleasant
place
where
one
can
purchase
the
most
fragrant
and
highly
prized
of
all
peruvian
wines
the
climate
is
agreeable
and
has
attracted
many
landlords
whose
estates
lie
chiefly
on
the
bleak
plateaus
of
the
surrounding
highlands
where
shepherds
tend
flocks
of
llamas
sheep
and
alpacas
we
were
cordially
welcomed
by
señor
viscarra
the
and
invited
to
stay
at
his
house
he
was
a
stranger
to
the
locality
and
as
the
visible
representative
of
a
powerful
and
central
government
was
none
too
popular
with
some
of
the
people
of
his
province
very
few
residents
of
a
provincial
capital
like
cotahuasi
have
ever
been
to
lima
probably
not
a
single
member
of
the
lima
government
had
ever
been
to
cotahuasi
consequently
one
could
not
expect
to
find
much
sympathy
between
the
two
the
difficulties
of
traveling
in
peru
are
so
great
as
to
discourage
pleasure
trips
with
our
letters
of
introduction
and
the
telegrams
that
had
preceded
us
from
the
prefect
at
arequipa
we
were
known
to
be
friends
of
the
government
and
so
were
doubly
welcome
to
the
by
nature
a
kind
and
generous
man
of
more
than
usual
education
and
intelligence
señor
viscarra
showed
himself
most
courteous
and
hospitable
to
us
in
every
particular
in
our
honor
he
called
together
his
friends
they
brought
pictures
of
theodore
roosevelt
and
elihu
root
and
made
a
large
american
flag
a
courtesy
we
deeply
appreciated
even
if
the
flag
did
have
only
stars
finally
they
gave
us
a
splendid
banquet
as
a
tribute
of
friendship
for
america
one
day
the
offered
to
have
his
personal
barber
attend
us
it
was
some
time
since
tucker
and
i
had
seen
a
the
chances
were
that
we
should
find
none
at
parinacochas
consequently
we
accepted
with
pleasure
when
the
barber
arrived
closely
guarded
by
a
gendarme
armed
with
a
loaded
rifle
we
learned
that
he
was
a
convict
from
the
local
jail
i
did
not
like
to
ask
the
nature
of
his
crime
but
he
looked
like
a
murderer
when
he
unwrapped
an
ancient
pair
of
clippers
from
an
unspeakably
soiled
and
oily
rag
i
wished
i
was
in
a
position
to
decline
to
place
myself
under
his
ministrations
the
however
had
been
so
kind
and
was
so
apologetic
as
to
the
inconveniences
of
the
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
bravely
forward
although
it
was
unpleasant
to
have
hair
trimmed
by
an
uncertain
pair
of
rusty
clippers
i
could
not
help
experiencing
a
feeling
of
relief
that
the
convict
did
not
have
a
pair
of
shears
he
was
working
too
near
my
jugular
vein
finally
the
period
of
torture
came
to
an
end
and
the
prisoner
accepted
his
fees
with
a
profound
salutation
we
breathed
sighs
of
relief
not
unmixed
with
sympathy
as
we
saw
him
marched
safely
away
by
the
gendarme
we
had
arrived
in
cotahuasi
almost
simultaneously
with
dr
bowman
and
topographer
hendriksen
they
had
encountered
extraordinary
difficulties
in
carrying
out
the
reconnaissance
of
the
meridian
but
were
now
past
the
worst
of
it
their
supplies
were
exhausted
so
those
which
we
had
brought
from
arequipa
were
doubly
welcome
watkins
was
assigned
to
assist
hendriksen
and
a
few
days
later
dr
bowman
started
south
to
study
the
geology
and
geography
of
the
desert
he
took
with
him
as
escort
corporal
gamarra
who
was
only
too
glad
to
escape
from
the
machinations
of
his
enemies
it
will
be
remembered
that
it
was
gamarra
who
had
successfully
defended
the
cotahuasi
barracks
and
jail
at
the
time
of
a
revolutionary
riot
which
occurred
some
months
previous
to
our
visit
the
accompanied
dr
bowman
out
of
town
for
gamarra
sake
they
left
the
house
at
three
in
the
morning
and
our
generous
host
agreed
to
ride
with
them
until
daybreak
in
his
important
monograph
the
andes
of
southern
peru
dr
bowman
writes
at
four
our
whispered
arrangements
were
made
we
opened
the
gates
noiselessly
and
our
small
cavalcade
hurried
through
the
streets
of
the
town
the
soldier
rode
ahead
his
rifle
across
his
saddle
and
directly
behind
him
rode
the
and
myself
the
pack
mules
were
in
the
rear
we
had
almost
reached
the
end
of
the
street
when
a
door
opened
suddenly
and
a
shower
of
sparks
flew
out
ahead
of
us
instantly
the
soldier
struck
spurs
into
his
mule
and
turned
into
a
side
street
the
drew
his
horse
back
savagely
and
when
the
next
shower
of
sparks
flew
out
pushed
me
against
the
wall
and
whispered
god
sake
who
is
it
then
suddenly
he
shouted
blowing
stop
blowing
the
cause
of
all
the
disturbance
was
a
shabby
tailor
who
had
gotten
up
at
this
unearthly
hour
to
start
his
day
work
by
pressing
clothes
for
some
insistent
customer
he
had
in
his
hand
an
ancient
filled
with
live
coals
on
which
he
had
been
vigorously
blowing
hence
the
sparks
that
a
penitent
tailor
and
his
ancient
goose
should
have
been
able
to
cause
such
terrific
excitement
at
that
hour
in
the
morning
would
have
interested
our
own
oliver
wendell
holmes
who
was
fond
of
referring
to
this
picturesque
apparatus
and
who
might
have
written
an
appropriate
essay
on
the
goose
that
startled
the
soldier
of
cotahuasi
with
particular
reference
to
his
being
a
possible
namesake
of
the
geese
that
aroused
the
soldiers
of
ancient
rome
figure
the
of
cotahuasi
his
military
aide
and
tucker
hendriksen
bowman
and
bingham
inspecting
the
local
industry
the
most
unusual
industry
of
cotahuasi
is
the
weaving
of
rugs
and
carpets
on
vertical
hand
looms
the
local
carpet
weavers
make
the
warp
and
woof
of
woolen
yarn
in
which
loops
of
alpaca
wool
black
gray
or
white
are
inserted
to
form
the
desired
pattern
the
loops
are
cut
so
as
to
form
a
deep
pile
the
result
is
a
delightfully
thick
warm
gray
rug
ordinarily
the
native
peruvian
rug
has
no
pile
probably
the
industry
was
brought
from
europe
by
some
spaniard
centuries
ago
it
seems
to
be
restricted
to
this
remote
region
the
rug
makers
are
a
small
group
of
indians
who
live
outside
the
town
but
who
carry
their
hand
looms
from
house
to
house
as
required
it
is
the
custom
for
the
person
who
desires
a
rug
to
buy
the
wool
supply
the
pattern
furnish
the
weaver
with
board
lodging
coca
tobacco
and
wine
and
watch
the
rug
grow
from
day
to
day
under
the
shelter
of
his
own
roof
the
rug
weavers
are
very
clever
in
copying
new
patterns
through
the
courtesy
of
señor
viscarra
we
eventually
received
several
small
rugs
woven
especially
for
us
from
monogram
designs
drawn
by
hendriksen
early
one
morning
in
november
we
said
to
our
friendly
host
and
directed
by
a
picturesque
old
guide
who
said
he
knew
the
road
to
parinacochas
we
left
cotahuasi
the
highway
crossed
the
neighboring
stream
on
a
bridge
the
central
pier
of
which
was
built
of
the
crudest
kind
of
masonry
piled
on
top
of
a
gigantic
boulder
in
midstream
the
main
arch
of
the
bridge
consisted
of
two
long
logs
across
which
had
been
thrown
a
quantity
of
brush
held
down
by
earth
and
stones
there
was
no
rail
on
either
side
but
our
mules
had
crossed
bridges
of
this
type
before
and
made
little
trouble
on
the
northern
side
of
the
valley
we
rode
through
a
compact
little
town
called
mungi
and
began
to
climb
out
of
the
canyon
passing
hundreds
of
very
fine
artificial
terraces
at
present
used
for
crops
of
maize
and
barley
in
one
place
our
road
led
us
by
a
little
waterfall
an
altogether
surprising
and
unexpected
phenomenon
in
this
arid
region
investigation
however
proved
that
it
was
artificial
as
well
as
the
fields
its
presence
may
be
due
to
a
temporary
connection
between
the
upper
and
lower
levels
of
ancient
irrigation
canals
hour
after
hour
our
pack
train
painfully
climbed
the
narrow
rocky
zigzag
trail
the
climate
is
favorable
for
agriculture
wherever
the
sides
of
the
canyon
were
not
absolutely
precipitous
terraces
and
irrigation
had
transformed
them
long
ago
into
arable
fields
four
thousand
feet
above
the
valley
floor
we
came
to
a
very
fine
series
of
beautiful
terraces
on
a
shelf
near
the
top
of
the
canyon
we
pitched
our
tent
near
some
rough
stone
corrals
used
by
shepherds
whose
flocks
grazed
on
the
lofty
plateau
beyond
and
near
a
tiny
brook
which
was
partly
frozen
over
the
next
morning
our
camp
was
at
an
elevation
of
feet
above
the
sea
near
by
were
turreted
rocks
curious
results
of
erosion
the
next
day
we
entered
a
region
of
mountain
pastures
we
passed
occasional
swamps
and
little
pools
of
snow
water
from
one
of
these
we
turned
and
looked
back
across
the
great
cotahuasi
canyon
to
the
glaciers
of
solimana
and
coropuna
now
growing
fainter
and
fainter
as
we
went
toward
parinacochas
at
an
altitude
of
feet
we
struck
across
a
great
barren
plateau
covered
with
rocks
and
sand
hardly
a
living
thing
in
sight
in
the
midst
of
it
we
came
to
a
beautiful
lake
but
it
was
not
parinacochas
on
the
plateau
it
was
intensely
cold
occasionally
i
dismounted
and
jogged
along
beside
my
mule
in
order
to
keep
warm
again
i
noticed
that
as
the
result
of
my
experiences
on
coropuna
i
suffered
no
discomfort
nor
any
symptoms
of
even
after
trotting
steadily
for
four
or
five
hundred
yards
in
the
afternoon
we
began
to
descend
from
the
plateau
toward
lampa
and
found
ourselves
in
the
pasture
lands
of
ajochiucha
where
ichu
grass
and
other
little
foliage
plants
watered
by
rain
and
snow
furnish
forage
for
large
flocks
of
sheep
llamas
and
alpacas
their
owners
live
in
the
cultivated
valleys
but
the
indian
herdsmen
must
face
the
storms
and
piercing
winds
of
the
high
pastures
alpacas
are
usually
timid
on
this
occasion
however
possibly
because
they
were
thirsty
and
were
seeking
water
holes
in
the
upper
courses
of
a
little
swale
they
stopped
and
allowed
me
to
observe
them
closely
the
fleece
of
the
alpaca
is
one
of
the
softest
in
the
world
however
due
to
the
fact
that
shrewd
tradesmen
finding
that
the
fabric
manufactured
from
alpaca
wool
was
highly
desired
many
years
ago
gave
the
name
to
a
far
cheaper
fabric
the
alpaca
of
commerce
a
material
used
for
coat
linings
umbrellas
and
thin
coats
is
a
fabric
of
cotton
and
wool
with
a
hard
surface
and
generally
dyed
black
it
usually
contains
no
real
alpaca
wool
at
all
and
is
fairly
cheap
the
real
alpaca
wool
which
comes
into
the
market
is
not
so
called
long
and
silky
straighter
than
the
sheep
wool
it
is
strong
small
of
fiber
very
soft
pliable
and
elastic
it
is
capable
of
being
woven
into
fabrics
of
great
beauty
and
comfort
many
of
the
silky
fluffy
knitted
garments
that
command
the
highest
prices
for
winter
wear
and
which
are
called
by
various
names
such
as
vicuña
camel
hair
are
really
made
of
alpaca
the
alpaca
like
its
cousin
the
llama
was
probably
domesticated
by
the
early
peruvians
from
the
wild
guanaco
largest
of
the
camels
of
the
new
world
the
guanaco
still
exists
in
a
wild
state
and
is
always
of
uniform
coloration
llamas
and
alpacas
are
extremely
variegated
the
llama
has
so
coarse
a
hair
that
it
is
seldom
woven
into
cloth
for
wearing
apparel
although
heavy
blankets
made
from
it
are
in
use
by
the
natives
bred
to
be
a
beast
of
burden
the
llama
is
accustomed
to
the
presence
of
strangers
and
is
not
any
more
timid
of
them
than
our
horses
and
cows
the
alpaca
however
requiring
better
and
scarcer
forage
short
tender
grass
and
plenty
of
water
frequents
the
most
remote
and
lofty
of
the
mountain
pastures
is
handled
only
when
the
fleece
is
removed
seldom
sees
any
one
except
the
peaceful
shepherds
and
is
extremely
shy
of
strangers
although
not
nearly
as
timid
as
its
distant
cousin
the
vicuña
i
shall
never
forget
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
some
alpacas
they
looked
for
all
the
world
like
the
of
our
toys
shops
woolly
along
the
neck
right
up
to
the
eyes
and
woolly
along
the
legs
right
down
to
the
invisible
wheels
there
was
something
inexpressibly
comic
about
these
animals
they
look
like
toys
on
wheels
but
actually
they
can
gallop
like
cows
the
llama
with
far
less
hair
on
head
neck
and
legs
is
also
amusing
but
in
a
different
way
his
expression
is
haughty
and
supercilious
in
the
extreme
he
usually
looks
as
though
his
presence
near
one
is
due
to
circumstances
over
which
he
really
had
no
control
pride
of
race
and
excessive
haughtiness
lead
him
to
carry
his
head
so
high
and
his
neck
so
stiffly
erect
that
he
can
be
corralled
with
others
of
his
kind
by
a
single
rope
passed
around
the
necks
of
the
entire
group
yet
he
can
be
bought
for
ten
dollars
on
the
pasture
lands
of
ajochiucha
there
were
many
ewes
and
lambs
both
of
llamas
and
alpacas
even
the
shepherds
were
mostly
children
more
timid
than
their
charges
they
crouched
inconspicuously
behind
rocks
and
shrubs
endeavoring
to
escape
our
notice
about
five
in
the
afternoon
on
a
dry
pampa
we
found
the
ruins
of
one
of
the
largest
known
inca
storehouses
chichipampa
an
interesting
reminder
of
the
days
when
benevolent
despots
ruled
the
andes
and
like
the
pharaohs
of
old
provided
against
possible
famine
the
locality
is
not
occupied
yet
near
by
are
populous
valleys
as
soon
as
we
left
our
camp
the
next
morning
we
came
abruptly
to
the
edge
of
the
lampa
valley
this
was
another
of
the
canyons
so
characteristic
of
this
region
our
pack
mules
grunted
and
groaned
as
they
picked
their
way
down
the
corkscrew
trail
it
overhangs
the
indian
town
of
colta
a
rather
scattered
collection
of
a
hundred
or
more
huts
here
again
as
in
the
cotahuasi
valley
are
hundreds
of
ancient
terraces
extending
for
thousands
of
feet
up
the
sides
of
the
canyon
many
of
them
were
badly
out
of
repair
but
those
near
colta
were
still
being
used
for
raising
crops
of
corn
potatoes
and
barley
the
uncultivated
spots
were
covered
with
cacti
thorn
bushes
and
the
gnarled
stunted
trees
of
a
region
in
the
town
itself
were
half
a
dozen
specimens
of
the
australian
eucalyptus
that
agreeable
and
extraordinarily
successful
colonist
which
one
encounters
not
only
in
the
heart
of
peru
but
in
the
andes
of
colombia
and
the
new
forest
preserves
of
california
and
the
hawaiian
islands
figure
inca
storehouses
at
chinchipampa
near
colta
colta
has
a
few
houses
with
tiled
roofs
some
of
them
have
open
verandas
on
the
second
floor
a
sure
indication
that
the
climate
is
at
times
comfortable
their
walls
are
built
of
adobe
and
so
are
the
walls
of
the
little
huts
of
the
majority
judging
by
the
rather
irregular
plan
of
the
streets
and
the
great
number
of
terraces
in
and
around
town
one
may
conclude
that
colta
goes
far
back
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
the
days
of
the
spanish
conquest
as
indeed
do
most
peruvian
towns
the
cities
of
lima
and
arequipa
are
noteworthy
exceptions
leaving
colta
we
wound
around
the
base
of
the
projecting
ridge
on
the
sides
of
which
were
many
evidences
of
ancient
culture
and
came
into
the
valley
of
huancahuanca
a
large
arid
canyon
the
guide
said
that
we
were
nearing
parinacochas
not
many
miles
away
across
two
canyons
was
a
peak
sarasara
lampa
the
chief
town
in
the
huancahuanca
canyon
lies
on
a
great
natural
terrace
of
gravel
and
alluvium
more
than
a
thousand
feet
above
the
river
part
of
the
terrace
seemed
to
be
irrigated
and
under
cultivation
it
was
proposed
by
the
energetic
farmers
at
the
time
of
our
visit
to
enlarge
the
system
of
irrigation
so
as
to
enable
them
to
cultivate
a
larger
part
of
the
pampa
on
which
they
lived
in
fact
the
new
irrigation
scheme
was
actually
in
process
of
being
carried
out
and
has
probably
long
since
been
completed
our
reception
in
lampa
was
not
cordial
it
will
be
remembered
that
our
military
escort
corporal
gamarra
had
gone
back
to
arequipa
with
dr
bowman
our
two
excellent
arrieros
the
tejada
brothers
declared
they
preferred
to
travel
without
any
brass
buttons
so
we
had
not
asked
the
of
cotahuasi
to
send
one
of
his
small
handful
of
gendarmes
along
with
us
probably
this
was
a
mistake
unless
one
is
traveling
in
peru
on
some
easily
understood
matter
such
as
prospecting
for
mines
or
representing
one
of
the
great
importing
and
commission
houses
or
actually
peddling
goods
one
can
not
help
arousing
the
natural
suspicions
of
a
people
to
whom
traveling
on
muleback
for
pleasure
is
unthinkable
and
scientific
exploration
for
its
own
sake
is
incomprehensible
of
course
if
the
explorers
arrive
accompanied
by
a
gendarme
it
is
perfectly
evident
that
the
enterprise
has
the
approval
and
probably
the
financial
backing
of
the
government
it
is
surmised
that
the
explorers
are
well
paid
and
what
would
be
otherwise
inconceivable
becomes
merely
one
of
the
ordinary
experiences
of
life
south
american
governments
almost
without
exception
are
paternalistic
and
their
citizens
are
led
to
expect
that
all
measures
connected
with
research
whether
it
be
scientific
economic
or
social
are
to
be
conducted
by
the
government
and
paid
for
out
of
the
national
treasury
individual
enterprise
is
not
encouraged
during
all
my
preceding
exploration
in
peru
i
had
had
such
an
easy
time
that
i
not
only
forgot
but
failed
to
realize
how
often
an
gendarme
provided
through
the
courtesy
of
president
leguia
government
had
quieted
suspicions
and
assured
us
a
cordial
welcome
now
however
when
without
a
gendarme
we
entered
the
smart
little
town
of
lampa
we
found
ourselves
immediately
and
unquestionably
the
objects
of
extreme
suspicion
and
distrust
yet
we
could
not
help
admiring
the
streets
freshly
whitewashed
houses
and
general
air
of
prosperity
and
enterprise
the
gobernador
of
the
town
lived
on
the
main
street
in
a
house
whose
courtyard
and
colonnade
were
probably
two
hundred
years
old
he
had
heard
nothing
of
our
undertaking
from
the
government
his
friends
urged
him
to
take
some
hostile
action
fortunately
our
arrieros
respectable
men
of
high
grade
although
strangers
in
lampa
were
able
to
allay
his
suspicions
temporarily
we
were
not
placed
under
arrest
although
i
am
sure
his
action
was
not
approved
by
the
very
suspicious
town
councilors
who
found
it
far
easier
to
suggest
reasons
for
our
being
fugitives
from
justice
than
to
understand
the
real
object
of
our
journey
the
very
fact
that
we
were
bound
for
lake
parinacochas
a
place
well
known
in
lampa
added
to
their
suspicion
it
seems
that
lampa
is
famous
for
its
weavers
who
utilize
the
wool
of
the
countless
herds
of
sheep
alpacas
and
vicuñas
in
this
vicinity
to
make
ponchos
and
blankets
of
high
grade
much
desired
not
only
in
this
locality
but
even
in
arequipa
these
are
marketed
as
so
often
happens
in
the
outlying
parts
of
the
world
at
a
great
annual
fair
attended
by
traders
who
come
hundreds
of
miles
bringing
the
manufactured
articles
of
the
outer
world
and
seeking
the
highly
desired
products
of
these
secluded
towns
the
great
fair
for
this
vicinity
has
been
held
for
untold
generations
on
the
shores
of
lake
parinacochas
every
one
is
anxious
to
attend
the
fair
which
is
an
occasion
for
seeing
one
friends
an
opportunity
for
jollification
carousing
and
general
enjoyment
like
a
large
county
fair
at
home
except
for
this
annual
fair
week
the
basin
of
parinacochas
is
as
bleak
and
desolate
as
our
own
with
scarcely
a
house
to
be
seen
except
those
that
are
used
for
the
purposes
of
the
fair
had
we
been
bound
for
parinacochas
at
the
proper
season
nothing
could
have
been
more
reasonable
and
praiseworthy
why
anybody
should
want
to
go
to
parinacochas
during
one
of
the
other
weeks
in
the
year
was
utterly
beyond
the
comprehension
or
understanding
of
these
village
worthies
so
to
our
selectmen
are
the
idiosyncrasies
of
itinerant
gypsies
who
wish
to
camp
in
our
deserted
the
tejadas
were
not
anxious
to
spend
the
night
in
town
probably
because
according
to
our
contract
the
cost
of
feeding
the
mules
devolved
entirely
upon
them
and
fodder
is
always
far
more
expensive
in
town
than
in
the
country
it
was
just
as
well
for
us
that
this
was
so
for
i
am
sure
that
before
morning
the
village
gossips
would
have
persuaded
the
gobernador
to
arrest
us
as
it
was
however
he
was
pleasant
and
hospitable
and
considerably
amused
at
the
embarrassment
of
an
indian
woman
who
was
weaving
at
a
hand
loom
in
his
courtyard
and
whom
we
desired
to
photograph
she
could
not
easily
escape
for
she
was
sitting
on
the
ground
with
one
end
of
the
loom
fastened
around
her
waist
the
other
end
tied
to
a
eucalyptus
tree
so
she
covered
her
eyes
and
mouth
with
her
hands
and
almost
wept
with
mortification
at
our
strange
procedure
peruvian
indian
women
are
invariably
extremely
shy
rarely
like
to
be
photographed
and
are
anxious
only
to
escape
observation
and
notice
the
ladies
of
the
gobernador
own
family
however
of
mixed
spanish
and
indian
ancestry
not
only
had
no
objection
to
being
photographed
but
were
moved
to
unseemly
and
unsympathetic
laughter
at
the
predicament
of
their
unfortunate
sister
after
leaving
lampa
we
found
ourselves
on
the
best
road
that
we
had
seen
in
a
long
time
its
excellence
was
undoubtedly
due
to
the
enterprise
and
energy
of
the
people
of
this
pleasant
town
one
might
expect
that
citizens
who
kept
their
town
so
clean
and
neat
and
were
engaged
in
the
unusual
act
of
constructing
new
irrigation
works
would
have
a
comfortable
road
in
the
direction
toward
which
they
usually
would
wish
to
go
namely
toward
the
coast
as
we
climbed
out
of
the
huancahuanca
valley
we
noticed
no
evidences
of
ancient
agricultural
terraces
either
on
the
sides
of
the
valley
or
on
the
alluvial
plain
which
has
given
rise
to
the
town
of
lampa
and
whose
products
have
made
its
people
well
fed
and
energetic
the
town
itself
seems
to
be
of
modern
origin
one
wonders
why
there
are
so
few
if
any
evidences
of
the
ancient
régime
when
there
are
so
many
a
short
distance
away
in
colta
and
the
valley
around
it
one
can
not
believe
that
the
incas
would
have
overlooked
such
a
fine
agricultural
opportunity
as
an
extensive
alluvial
terrace
in
a
region
where
there
is
so
little
arable
land
possibly
the
very
excellence
of
the
land
and
its
relative
flatness
rendered
artificial
terracing
unnecessary
in
the
minds
of
the
ancient
people
who
lived
here
on
the
other
hand
it
may
have
been
occupied
until
late
inca
times
by
one
of
the
coast
tribes
whatever
the
cause
certainly
the
deep
canyon
of
huancahuanca
divides
two
very
different
regions
to
come
in
a
few
hours
from
thickly
terraced
colta
to
unterraced
lampa
was
so
striking
as
to
give
us
cause
for
thought
and
speculation
it
is
well
known
that
in
the
early
days
before
the
inca
conquest
of
peru
not
so
very
long
before
the
spanish
conquest
there
were
marked
differences
between
the
tribes
who
inhabited
the
high
plateau
and
those
who
lived
along
the
shore
of
the
pacific
their
pottery
is
as
different
as
possible
in
design
and
ornamentation
the
architecture
of
their
cities
and
temples
is
absolutely
distinct
relative
abundance
of
flat
lands
never
led
them
to
develop
terracing
to
the
same
extent
that
the
mountain
people
had
done
perhaps
on
this
alluvial
terrace
there
lived
a
remnant
of
the
coastal
peoples
excavation
would
show
scarcely
had
we
climbed
out
of
the
valley
of
huancahuanca
and
surmounted
the
ridge
when
we
came
in
sight
of
more
artificial
terraces
beyond
a
broad
deep
valley
rose
the
extinct
volcanic
cone
of
mt
sarasara
now
relatively
close
at
hand
its
lower
slopes
separated
from
us
by
another
canyon
snow
lay
in
the
gulches
and
ravines
near
the
top
of
the
mountain
our
road
ran
near
the
towns
of
pararca
and
colcabamba
the
latter
much
like
colta
a
straggling
village
of
thatched
huts
surrounded
by
hundreds
of
terraces
the
vegetation
on
the
valley
slopes
indicated
occasional
rains
near
pararca
we
passed
fields
of
barley
and
wheat
growing
on
old
terraces
on
every
hand
were
signs
of
a
fairly
large
population
engaged
in
agriculture
utilizing
fields
which
had
been
carefully
prepared
for
them
by
their
ancestors
they
were
not
using
all
however
we
noticed
hundreds
of
terraces
that
did
not
appear
to
have
been
under
cultivation
recently
they
may
have
been
lying
fallow
temporarily
our
arrieros
avoided
the
little
towns
and
selected
a
camp
site
on
the
roadside
near
the
finca
rodadero
after
all
when
one
has
a
comfortable
tent
good
food
and
skillful
arrieros
it
is
far
pleasanter
to
spend
the
night
in
the
clean
open
country
even
at
an
elevation
of
or
feet
than
to
be
surrounded
by
the
smells
and
noises
of
an
indian
town
the
next
morning
we
went
through
some
wheat
fields
past
the
town
of
puyusca
another
large
indian
village
of
thatched
adobe
houses
placed
high
on
the
shoulder
of
a
rocky
hill
so
as
to
leave
the
best
arable
land
available
for
agriculture
it
is
in
a
shallow
valley
full
of
springs
the
appearance
of
the
country
had
changed
entirely
since
we
left
cotahuasi
the
desert
and
its
canyons
seemed
to
be
far
behind
us
here
was
a
region
of
gently
sloping
hills
covered
with
terraces
where
the
cereals
of
the
temperate
zone
appeared
to
be
easily
grown
finally
leaving
the
grain
fields
we
climbed
up
to
a
shallow
depression
in
the
low
range
at
the
head
of
the
valley
and
found
ourselves
on
the
rim
of
a
great
upland
basin
more
than
twenty
miles
across
in
the
center
of
the
basin
was
a
large
oval
lake
its
borders
were
pink
the
water
in
most
of
the
lake
was
dark
blue
but
near
the
shore
the
water
was
pink
a
light
what
could
give
it
such
a
curious
color
nothing
but
flamingoes
countless
thousands
of
flamingoes
parinacochas
at
last
chapter
iv
flamingo
lake
the
parinacochas
basin
is
at
an
elevation
of
between
and
feet
above
sea
level
it
is
about
miles
northwest
of
arequipa
and
miles
southwest
of
cuzco
and
enjoys
a
fair
amount
of
rainfall
the
lake
is
fed
by
springs
and
small
streams
in
past
geological
times
the
lake
then
very
much
larger
had
an
outlet
not
far
from
the
town
of
puyusca
at
present
parinacochas
has
no
visible
outlet
it
is
possible
that
the
large
springs
which
we
noticed
as
we
came
up
the
valley
by
puyusca
may
be
fed
from
the
lake
on
the
other
hand
we
found
numerous
small
springs
on
the
very
borders
of
the
lake
generally
occurring
in
swampy
hillocks
built
up
perhaps
by
mineral
deposits
three
or
four
feet
higher
than
the
surrounding
plain
there
are
very
old
beach
marks
well
above
the
shore
the
natives
told
us
that
in
the
wet
season
the
lake
was
considerably
higher
than
at
present
although
we
could
find
no
recent
evidence
to
indicate
that
it
had
been
much
more
than
a
foot
above
its
present
level
nevertheless
a
rise
of
a
foot
would
enlarge
the
area
of
the
lake
considerably
when
making
preparations
in
new
haven
for
the
bathymetric
survey
of
lake
parinacochas
suggested
by
sir
clements
markham
we
found
it
impossible
to
discover
any
indication
in
geographical
literature
as
to
whether
the
depth
of
the
lake
might
be
ten
feet
or
ten
thousand
feet
we
decided
to
take
a
chance
on
its
not
being
more
than
ten
hundred
feet
with
the
kind
assistance
of
george
bassett
i
secured
a
thousand
feet
of
stout
fish
line
known
to
anglers
as
thread
wound
on
a
large
wooden
reel
for
convenience
in
handling
while
we
were
at
chuquibamba
watkins
had
spent
many
weary
hours
inserting
one
hundred
and
white
and
red
cloth
markers
at
intervals
in
the
strands
of
this
heavy
line
so
that
we
might
be
able
more
rapidly
to
determine
the
result
in
fathoms
arrived
at
a
low
peninsula
on
the
north
shore
of
the
lake
tucker
and
i
pitched
our
camp
sent
our
mules
back
to
puyusca
for
fodder
and
set
up
the
acme
folding
boat
which
we
had
brought
so
many
miles
on
muleback
for
the
sounding
operations
the
acme
proved
easy
to
assemble
although
this
was
our
first
experience
with
it
its
lightness
enabled
it
to
be
floated
at
the
edge
of
the
lake
even
in
very
shallow
water
and
its
rigidity
was
much
appreciated
in
the
late
afternoon
when
the
high
winds
raised
a
vicious
little
sea
rowing
out
on
waters
which
we
were
told
by
the
natives
had
never
before
been
navigated
by
craft
of
any
kind
i
began
to
take
soundings
lake
titicaca
is
over
nine
hundred
feet
deep
it
would
be
aggravating
if
lake
parinacochas
should
prove
to
be
over
a
thousand
for
i
had
brought
no
extra
line
even
nine
hundred
feet
would
make
sounding
slow
work
and
the
lake
covered
an
area
of
over
seventy
square
miles
it
was
with
mixed
feelings
of
trepidation
and
expectation
that
i
rowed
out
five
miles
from
shore
and
made
a
sounding
holding
the
large
reel
firmly
in
both
hands
i
cast
the
lead
overboard
the
reel
gave
a
turn
or
two
and
stopped
something
was
wrong
the
line
did
not
run
out
was
the
reel
stuck
no
the
apparatus
was
in
perfect
running
order
then
what
was
the
matter
the
bottom
was
too
near
alas
for
all
the
pains
that
bassett
had
taken
to
put
a
thousand
feet
of
the
best
strong
line
on
one
reel
alas
for
watkins
and
his
patient
insertion
of
one
hundred
and
the
bottom
of
the
lake
was
only
four
feet
away
from
the
bottom
of
my
boat
after
three
or
four
days
of
strenuous
rowing
up
and
down
the
eighteen
miles
of
the
lake
length
and
back
and
forth
across
the
seventeen
miles
of
its
width
i
never
succeeded
in
wetting
watkins
first
marker
several
hundred
soundings
failed
to
show
more
than
five
feet
of
water
anywhere
possibly
if
we
had
come
in
the
rainy
season
we
might
at
least
have
wet
one
marker
but
at
the
time
of
our
visit
november
the
lake
had
a
maximum
depth
of
feet
the
satisfaction
of
making
this
slight
contribution
to
geographic
knowledge
was
i
fear
lost
in
the
chagrin
of
not
finding
a
really
noteworthy
body
of
water
who
would
have
thought
that
so
long
a
lake
could
be
so
shallow
however
my
feelings
were
soothed
by
remembering
the
story
of
the
captain
of
a
who
was
once
told
that
the
salt
lake
near
one
of
the
red
hills
between
honolulu
and
pearl
harbor
was
reported
by
the
natives
to
be
bottomless
he
ordered
one
of
the
ship
heavy
boats
to
be
carried
from
the
shore
several
miles
inland
to
the
salt
lake
at
great
expenditure
of
strength
and
labor
the
story
told
me
in
my
boyhood
does
not
say
how
much
sounding
line
was
brought
anyhow
they
found
this
fathomless
body
of
water
to
be
not
more
than
fifteen
feet
deep
notwithstanding
my
disappointment
at
the
depth
of
parinacochas
i
was
very
glad
that
we
had
brought
the
little
folding
boat
for
it
enabled
me
to
float
gently
about
among
the
myriads
of
birds
which
use
the
shallow
waters
of
the
lake
as
a
favorite
feeding
ground
pink
flamingoes
white
gulls
small
divers
large
black
ducks
sandpipers
black
ibis
teal
ducks
and
large
geese
on
the
banks
were
ground
owls
and
woodpeckers
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
natives
should
have
named
this
body
of
water
parinacochas
parina
flamingo
cochas
lake
the
flamingoes
are
here
in
incredible
multitudes
they
far
outnumber
all
other
birds
and
as
i
have
said
actually
make
the
shallow
waters
of
the
lake
look
pink
fortunately
they
had
not
been
hunted
for
their
plumage
and
were
not
timid
after
two
days
of
familiarity
with
the
boat
they
were
willing
to
let
me
approach
within
twenty
yards
before
finally
taking
wing
the
coloring
in
this
land
of
drab
grays
and
browns
was
a
delight
to
the
eye
the
head
is
white
the
beak
black
the
neck
white
shading
into
the
body
pinkish
white
on
the
back
the
breast
white
and
the
tail
the
wings
are
in
front
but
the
tips
and
the
are
black
as
they
stand
or
wade
in
the
water
their
general
appearance
is
chiefly
when
they
rise
from
the
water
however
the
black
of
the
wings
become
strikingly
conspicuous
and
cause
a
flock
of
flying
flamingoes
to
be
a
wonderful
contrast
in
when
flying
the
flamingo
seems
to
keep
his
head
moving
steadily
forward
at
an
even
pace
although
the
ropelike
neck
undulates
with
the
slow
beating
of
the
wings
i
could
not
be
sure
that
it
was
not
an
optical
delusion
nevertheless
i
thought
the
heavy
body
was
propelled
irregularly
while
the
head
moved
forward
at
uniform
speed
the
difference
being
caught
up
in
the
undulations
of
the
neck
figure
flamingos
on
lake
parinacochas
and
mt
sarasara
the
flamingo
is
an
amusing
bird
to
watch
with
its
haughty
roman
nose
and
long
ropelike
neck
which
it
coils
and
twists
in
a
most
incredible
manner
it
seems
specially
intended
to
distract
one
mind
from
bathymetric
disappointments
its
hoarse
croaking
what
is
it
what
is
it
seemed
to
express
sympathy
with
the
sounding
operations
on
one
bright
moonlight
night
the
flamingoes
were
very
noisy
keeping
up
a
continual
clatter
of
very
hoarse
apparently
they
failed
to
find
out
the
answer
in
time
to
go
to
bed
at
the
proper
time
for
next
morning
we
found
them
all
sound
asleep
standing
in
quiet
bays
with
their
heads
tucked
under
their
wings
during
the
course
of
the
forenoon
when
the
water
was
quiet
they
waded
far
out
into
the
lake
in
the
afternoon
as
winds
and
waves
arose
they
came
in
nearer
the
shores
but
seldom
left
the
water
the
great
extent
of
shallow
water
in
parinacochas
offers
them
a
splendid
wide
feeding
ground
we
wondered
where
they
all
came
from
apparently
they
do
not
breed
here
although
there
were
thousands
and
thousands
of
birds
we
could
find
no
flamingo
nests
either
old
or
new
search
as
we
would
it
offers
a
most
interesting
problem
for
some
enterprising
biological
explorer
probably
frank
chapman
will
some
day
solve
it
next
in
number
to
the
flamingoes
were
the
beautiful
white
gulls
or
terns
looking
strangely
out
of
place
in
this
andean
lake
feet
above
the
sea
they
usually
kept
together
in
flocks
of
several
hundred
there
were
quantities
of
small
black
divers
in
the
deeper
parts
of
the
lake
where
the
flamingoes
did
not
go
the
divers
were
very
quick
and
keen
true
individualists
operating
alone
and
showing
astonishing
ability
in
swimming
long
distances
under
water
the
large
black
ducks
were
much
more
fearless
than
the
flamingoes
and
were
willing
to
swim
very
near
the
canoe
when
frightened
they
raced
over
the
water
at
a
tremendous
pace
using
both
wings
and
feet
in
their
efforts
to
escape
these
ducks
kept
in
large
flocks
and
were
about
as
common
as
the
small
divers
here
and
there
in
the
lake
were
a
few
tiny
little
islands
each
containing
a
single
deserted
nest
possibly
belonging
to
an
ibis
or
a
duck
in
the
banks
of
a
low
stream
near
our
first
camp
were
holes
made
by
woodpeckers
who
in
this
country
look
in
vain
for
trees
and
telegraph
poles
occasionally
a
mile
or
so
from
shore
my
boat
would
startle
a
great
amphibious
ox
standing
in
the
water
up
to
his
middle
calmly
eating
the
succulent
water
grass
to
secure
it
he
had
to
plunge
his
head
and
neck
well
under
the
surface
while
i
was
raising
blisters
and
frightening
oxen
and
flamingoes
tucker
triangulated
the
parinacochas
basin
making
the
first
accurate
map
of
this
vicinity
as
he
carried
his
theodolite
from
point
to
point
he
often
stirred
up
little
ground
owls
who
gazed
at
him
with
solemn
reproachful
looks
and
they
were
not
the
only
individuals
to
regard
his
activities
with
suspicion
and
dislike
part
of
my
work
was
to
construct
signal
stations
by
piling
rocks
at
conspicuous
points
on
the
hills
so
as
to
enable
the
triangulation
to
proceed
as
rapidly
as
possible
during
the
night
some
of
these
signal
stations
would
disappear
torn
down
by
the
superstitious
shepherds
who
lived
in
scattered
clusters
of
huts
and
declined
to
have
strange
gods
set
up
in
their
vicinity
perhaps
they
thought
their
pastures
were
being
preempted
we
saw
hundreds
of
their
sheep
and
cattle
feeding
on
flat
lands
formerly
the
bed
of
the
lake
the
hills
of
the
parinacochas
basin
are
bare
of
trees
and
offer
some
pasturage
in
some
places
they
are
covered
with
broken
rock
the
grass
was
kept
closely
cropped
by
the
degenerate
descendants
of
sheep
brought
into
the
country
during
spanish
colonial
days
they
were
small
in
size
and
mostly
white
in
color
although
there
were
many
black
ones
we
were
told
that
the
sheep
were
worth
about
fifty
cents
apiece
here
on
our
first
arrival
at
parinacochas
we
were
left
severely
alone
by
the
shepherds
but
two
days
later
curiosity
slowly
overcame
their
shyness
and
a
group
of
young
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
gradually
brought
their
grazing
flocks
nearer
and
nearer
the
camp
in
order
to
gaze
stealthily
on
these
strange
visitors
who
lived
in
a
cloth
house
actually
moved
over
the
forbidding
waters
of
the
lake
and
busied
themselves
from
day
to
day
with
strange
magic
raising
and
lowering
a
glittering
glass
eye
on
a
tripod
the
women
wore
dresses
of
heavy
material
the
skirts
reaching
halfway
from
knee
to
ankle
in
lieu
of
hats
they
had
small
variegated
shawls
made
on
hand
looms
folded
so
as
to
make
a
pointed
bonnet
over
the
head
and
protect
the
neck
and
shoulders
from
sun
and
wind
each
woman
was
busily
spinning
with
a
hand
spindle
but
carried
her
baby
and
its
gear
and
blankets
in
a
hammock
or
sling
attached
to
a
that
went
over
her
head
these
sling
were
neatly
woven
of
soft
wool
and
decorated
with
attractive
patterns
both
women
and
boys
were
barefooted
the
boys
wore
old
felt
hats
of
native
manufacture
and
coats
and
long
trousers
much
too
large
for
them
at
one
end
of
the
upland
basin
rises
the
graceful
cone
of
mt
sarasara
the
view
of
its
peak
reflected
in
the
glassy
waters
of
the
lake
in
the
early
morning
was
one
long
to
be
remembered
sarasara
must
once
have
been
much
higher
than
it
is
at
present
its
volcanic
cone
has
been
sharply
eroded
by
snow
and
ice
in
the
days
of
its
greater
altitude
and
consequently
wider
snow
fields
the
melting
snows
probably
served
to
make
parinacochas
a
very
much
larger
body
of
water
although
we
were
here
at
the
beginning
of
summer
the
wind
that
came
down
from
the
mountain
at
night
was
very
cold
our
minimum
thermometer
registered
near
the
banks
of
the
lake
at
night
nevertheless
there
was
only
a
very
thin
film
of
ice
on
the
borders
of
the
lake
in
the
morning
and
except
in
the
most
shallow
bays
there
was
no
ice
visible
far
from
the
bank
the
temperature
of
the
water
at
near
the
shore
and
ten
inches
below
the
surface
was
while
farther
out
it
was
three
or
four
degrees
warmer
by
noon
the
temperature
of
the
water
half
a
mile
from
shore
was
shortly
after
noon
a
strong
wind
came
up
from
the
coast
stirring
up
the
shallow
water
and
cooling
it
soon
afterwards
the
temperature
of
the
water
began
to
fall
and
although
the
hot
sun
was
shining
brightly
almost
directly
overhead
it
went
down
to
by
the
water
of
the
lake
is
brackish
yet
we
were
able
to
make
our
camps
on
the
banks
of
small
streams
of
sweet
water
although
in
each
case
near
the
shore
of
the
lake
a
specimen
of
the
water
taken
near
the
shore
was
brought
back
to
new
haven
and
analyzed
by
george
jamieson
of
the
sheffield
scientific
school
he
found
that
it
contained
small
quantities
of
silica
iron
phosphate
magnesium
carbonate
calcium
carbonate
calcium
sulphate
potassium
nitrate
potassium
sulphate
sodium
borate
sodium
sulphate
and
a
considerable
quantity
of
sodium
chloride
parinacochas
water
contains
more
carbonate
and
potassium
than
that
of
the
atlantic
ocean
or
the
great
salt
lake
as
compared
with
the
salinity
of
typical
salt
waters
that
of
lake
parinacochas
occupies
an
intermediate
position
containing
more
than
lake
less
than
that
of
the
atlantic
and
only
one
twentieth
the
salinity
of
the
great
salt
lake
when
we
moved
to
our
second
camp
the
tejada
brothers
preferred
to
let
their
mules
rest
in
the
puyusca
valley
where
there
was
excellent
alfalfa
forage
the
arrieros
engaged
at
their
own
expense
a
pack
train
which
consisted
chiefly
of
parinacochas
burros
it
is
the
custom
hereabouts
to
enclose
the
packs
in
nets
made
of
rawhide
which
are
then
fastened
to
the
pack
animal
by
a
surcingle
the
indians
who
came
with
the
burro
train
were
sturdy
fellows
dressed
in
store
clothes
and
straw
hats
their
burros
were
as
cantankerous
as
donkeys
can
be
never
fractious
or
flighty
but
stubbornly
resisting
step
by
step
every
effort
to
haul
them
near
the
loads
our
second
camp
was
near
the
village
of
incahuasi
the
house
of
the
inca
at
the
northwestern
corner
of
the
basin
raimondi
visited
it
in
the
representative
of
the
owner
of
parinacochas
occupies
one
of
the
houses
the
other
buildings
are
used
only
during
the
third
week
in
august
at
the
time
of
the
annual
fair
in
the
now
deserted
plaza
were
many
low
stone
rectangles
partly
covered
with
adobe
and
ready
to
be
converted
into
booths
the
plaza
was
surrounded
by
long
thatched
buildings
of
adobe
and
stone
mostly
of
rough
ashlars
a
few
ashlars
showed
signs
of
having
been
carefully
dressed
by
ancient
stonemasons
some
loose
ashlars
weighed
half
a
ton
and
had
baffled
the
attempts
of
modern
builders
in
constructing
the
large
church
advantage
was
taken
of
a
beautifully
laid
wall
of
ashlars
incahuasi
was
well
named
there
had
been
at
one
time
an
inca
house
here
possibly
a
temple
lakes
were
once
objects
of
worship
or
constructed
in
order
to
enable
the
chiefs
and
to
travel
comfortably
over
the
vast
domains
of
the
incas
we
found
the
slopes
of
the
hills
of
the
parinacochas
basin
to
be
well
covered
with
remains
of
ancient
terraces
probably
potatoes
and
other
root
crops
were
once
raised
here
in
fairly
large
quantities
perhaps
deforestation
and
subsequent
increased
aridity
might
account
for
the
desertion
of
these
lands
the
hills
west
of
the
lake
are
intersected
by
a
few
dry
gulches
in
which
are
caves
that
have
been
used
as
burial
places
the
caves
had
at
one
time
been
walled
in
with
rocks
laid
in
adobe
but
these
walls
had
been
partly
broken
down
so
as
to
permit
the
sepulchers
to
be
rifled
of
whatever
objects
of
value
they
might
have
contained
we
found
nine
or
ten
skulls
lying
loose
in
the
rubble
of
the
caves
one
of
the
skulls
seemed
to
have
been
trepanned
on
top
of
the
ridge
are
the
remains
of
an
ancient
road
fifty
feet
wide
a
broad
grassy
way
through
fields
of
loose
stones
no
effort
had
been
made
at
grading
or
paving
this
road
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
its
having
been
used
in
recent
times
it
runs
from
the
lake
across
the
ridge
in
a
westerly
direction
toward
a
broad
valley
where
there
are
many
terraces
and
cultivated
fields
it
is
not
far
from
nasca
probably
the
stones
were
picked
up
and
piled
on
each
side
to
save
time
in
driving
caravans
of
llamas
across
the
stony
ridges
the
llama
dislikes
to
step
over
any
obstacle
even
a
very
low
wall
the
grassy
roadway
would
certainly
encourage
the
supercilious
beasts
to
proceed
in
the
desired
direction
in
many
places
on
the
hills
were
to
be
seen
outlines
of
large
and
small
rock
circles
and
shelters
erected
by
herdsmen
for
temporary
protection
against
the
sudden
storms
of
snow
and
hail
which
come
up
with
unexpected
fierceness
at
this
elevation
feet
the
shelters
were
in
a
very
ruinous
state
they
were
made
of
rough
scoriaceous
lava
rocks
the
circular
enclosures
varied
from
to
feet
in
diameter
most
of
them
showed
no
evidences
whatever
of
recent
occupation
the
smaller
walls
may
have
been
the
foundation
of
small
circular
huts
the
larger
walls
were
probably
intended
as
corrals
to
keep
alpacas
and
llamas
from
straying
at
night
and
to
guard
against
wolves
or
coyotes
i
confess
to
being
quite
mystified
as
to
the
age
of
these
remains
it
is
possible
that
they
represent
a
settlement
of
shepherds
within
historic
times
although
from
the
shape
and
size
of
the
walls
i
am
inclined
to
doubt
this
the
shelters
may
have
been
built
by
the
herdsmen
of
the
incas
anyhow
those
on
the
hills
west
of
parinacochas
had
not
been
used
for
a
long
time
nasca
which
is
not
very
far
away
to
the
northwest
was
the
center
of
one
of
the
most
artistic
cultures
in
peru
it
is
famous
for
its
very
delicate
pottery
our
third
camp
was
on
the
south
side
of
the
lake
near
us
the
traces
of
the
ancient
road
led
to
the
ruins
of
two
large
circular
corrals
substantiating
my
belief
that
this
curious
roadway
was
intended
to
keep
the
llamas
from
straying
at
will
over
the
pasture
lands
on
the
south
shores
of
the
lake
there
were
more
signs
of
occupation
than
on
the
north
although
there
is
nothing
so
clearly
belonging
to
the
time
of
the
incas
as
the
ashlars
and
finely
built
wall
at
incahuasi
on
top
of
one
of
the
rocky
promontories
we
found
the
rough
stone
foundations
of
the
walls
of
a
little
village
the
slopes
of
the
promontory
were
nearly
precipitous
on
three
sides
forty
or
fifty
very
primitive
dwellings
had
been
at
one
time
huddled
together
here
in
a
position
which
could
easily
be
defended
we
found
among
the
ruins
a
few
crude
potsherds
and
some
bits
of
obsidian
there
was
nothing
about
the
ruins
of
the
little
hill
village
to
give
any
indication
of
inca
origin
probably
it
goes
back
to
days
no
one
could
tell
us
anything
about
it
if
there
were
traditions
concerning
it
they
were
well
concealed
by
the
silent
superstitious
shepherds
of
the
vicinity
possibly
it
was
regarded
as
an
unlucky
spot
cursed
by
the
gods
the
neighboring
slopes
showed
faint
evidences
of
having
been
roughly
terraced
and
cultivated
the
tutu
potato
would
grow
here
a
hardy
variety
not
edible
in
the
fresh
state
but
considered
highly
desirable
for
making
potato
flour
after
having
been
repeatedly
frozen
and
its
bitter
juices
all
extracted
so
would
other
highland
root
crops
of
the
peruvians
such
as
the
oca
a
relative
of
our
sheep
sorrel
the
añu
a
kind
of
nasturtium
and
the
ullucu
ullucus
tuberosus
on
the
flats
near
the
shore
were
large
corrals
still
kept
in
good
repair
new
walls
were
being
built
by
the
indians
at
the
time
of
our
visit
near
the
southeast
corner
of
the
lake
were
a
few
modern
huts
built
of
stone
and
adobe
with
thatched
roofs
inhabited
by
drovers
and
shepherds
we
saw
more
cattle
at
the
east
end
of
the
lake
than
elsewhere
but
they
seemed
to
prefer
the
sweet
water
grasses
of
the
lake
to
the
tough
on
the
slopes
of
sarasara
viscachas
were
common
amongst
the
gray
rocks
they
are
hunted
for
their
beautiful
pearly
gray
fur
the
chinchilla
of
commerce
they
are
also
very
good
eating
so
they
have
disappeared
from
the
more
accessible
parts
of
peru
one
rarely
sees
them
although
they
may
be
found
on
bleak
uplands
in
the
mountains
of
uilcapampa
a
region
rarely
visited
by
any
one
on
account
of
treacherous
bogs
and
deep
tams
writers
sometimes
call
viscachas
they
have
large
rounded
ears
long
hind
legs
a
long
bushy
tail
and
do
look
like
a
cross
between
a
rabbit
and
a
gray
squirrel
surmounting
one
of
the
higher
ridges
one
day
i
came
suddenly
upon
an
unusually
large
herd
of
wild
vicuñas
it
included
more
than
one
hundred
individuals
their
relative
fearlessness
also
testified
to
the
remoteness
of
parinacochas
and
the
small
amount
of
hunting
that
is
done
here
vicuñas
have
never
been
domesticated
but
are
often
hunted
for
their
skins
their
silky
fleece
is
even
finer
than
alpaca
the
more
fleecy
portions
of
their
skins
are
sewed
together
to
make
quilts
as
soft
as
eider
down
and
of
a
golden
brown
color
after
tucker
finished
his
triangulation
of
the
lake
i
told
the
arrieros
to
find
the
shortest
road
home
they
smiled
murmured
arequipa
and
started
south
we
soon
came
to
the
rim
of
the
maraicasa
valley
where
peeping
up
over
one
of
the
hills
far
to
the
south
we
got
a
little
glimpse
of
coropuna
the
maraicasa
valley
is
well
inhabited
and
there
were
many
grain
fields
in
sight
although
few
seemed
to
be
terraced
the
surrounding
hills
were
smooth
and
well
rounded
and
the
valley
bottom
contained
much
alluvial
land
we
passed
through
it
and
after
dark
reached
sondor
a
tiny
hamlet
inhabited
by
extremely
suspicious
and
inhospitable
drovers
in
the
darkness
don
pablo
pleaded
with
the
owners
of
a
hut
and
told
them
how
important
we
were
they
were
unwilling
to
give
us
any
shelter
so
we
were
forced
to
pitch
our
tent
in
the
very
rocky
and
dirty
corral
immediately
in
front
of
one
of
the
huts
where
pigs
dogs
and
cattle
annoyed
us
all
night
if
we
had
arrived
before
dark
we
might
have
received
a
different
welcome
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
herdsmen
only
showed
the
customary
hostility
of
mountaineers
and
wilderness
folk
to
those
who
do
not
arrive
in
the
daytime
when
they
can
be
plainly
seen
and
fully
discussed
the
next
morning
we
passed
some
fairly
recent
lava
flows
and
noted
also
many
curious
rock
forms
caused
by
wind
and
sand
erosion
we
had
now
left
the
belt
of
grazing
lands
and
once
more
come
into
the
desert
at
length
we
reached
the
rim
of
the
caraveli
canyon
and
our
eyes
were
gladdened
at
sight
of
the
rich
green
oasis
a
striking
contrast
to
the
barren
walls
of
the
canyon
as
we
descended
the
long
winding
road
we
passed
many
fine
specimens
of
tree
cactus
at
the
foot
of
the
steep
descent
we
found
ourselves
separated
from
the
nearest
settlement
by
a
very
wide
river
which
it
was
necessary
to
ford
neither
of
the
tejadas
had
ever
been
here
before
and
its
depths
and
dangers
were
unknown
fortunately
pablo
found
a
forlorn
individual
living
in
a
tiny
hut
on
the
bank
who
indicated
which
way
lay
safety
after
an
exciting
two
hours
we
finally
got
across
to
the
desired
shore
animals
and
men
were
glad
enough
to
leave
the
high
arid
desert
and
enter
the
oasis
of
caraveli
with
its
luscious
green
fields
of
alfalfa
its
shady
fig
trees
and
tall
eucalyptus
the
air
pungent
with
the
smell
of
rich
vegetation
seemed
cooler
and
more
invigorating
we
found
at
caraveli
a
modern
british
enterprise
the
gold
mine
of
la
victoria
prain
the
manager
and
his
associates
at
the
camp
gave
us
a
cordial
welcome
and
a
wonderful
dinner
which
i
shall
long
remember
after
two
months
in
the
coastal
desert
it
seemed
like
home
during
the
evening
we
learned
of
the
difficulties
prain
had
had
in
bringing
his
machinery
across
the
plateau
from
the
nearest
port
our
own
troubles
seemed
as
nothing
the
cost
of
transporting
on
muleback
each
of
the
larger
pieces
of
the
quartz
was
equivalent
to
the
price
of
a
pack
mule
as
a
matter
of
fact
although
it
is
only
a
two
days
journey
pack
animals
backs
are
not
built
to
survive
the
strain
of
carrying
pieces
of
machinery
weighing
five
hundred
pounds
over
a
desert
plateau
up
to
an
altitude
of
feet
mules
brought
the
machinery
from
the
coast
to
the
brink
of
the
canyon
but
no
mule
could
possibly
have
carried
it
down
the
steep
trail
into
caraveli
accordingly
a
windlass
had
been
constructed
on
the
edge
of
the
precipice
and
the
machinery
had
been
lowered
piece
by
piece
by
block
and
tackle
such
was
one
of
the
obstacles
with
which
these
undaunted
engineers
had
had
to
contend
had
the
man
who
designed
the
machinery
ever
traveled
with
a
pack
train
climbing
up
and
down
over
these
rocky
stairways
called
mountain
trails
i
am
sure
that
he
would
have
made
his
castings
much
smaller
figure
tucker
on
a
mountain
trail
near
caraveli
figure
the
main
street
of
chuquibamba
it
is
astonishing
how
often
people
who
ship
goods
to
the
interior
of
south
america
fail
to
realize
that
no
single
piece
should
be
any
heavier
than
a
pack
animal
can
carry
comfortably
on
one
side
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
ought
to
be
the
extreme
limit
of
a
unit
even
a
large
strong
mule
will
last
only
a
few
days
on
such
trails
as
are
shown
in
the
accompanying
illustration
if
the
total
weight
of
his
cargo
is
over
three
hundred
pounds
when
a
single
piece
weighs
more
than
two
hundred
pounds
it
has
to
be
balanced
on
the
back
of
the
animal
then
the
load
rocks
and
chafes
the
unfortunate
mule
besides
causing
great
inconvenience
and
constant
worry
to
the
muleteers
as
a
matter
of
expediency
it
is
better
to
have
the
individual
units
weigh
about
pounds
such
a
weight
is
easier
for
the
arrieros
to
handle
in
the
loading
unloading
and
reloading
that
goes
on
all
day
long
particularly
if
the
trail
is
as
usually
happens
in
the
andes
furthermore
one
unit
makes
a
fair
load
for
a
man
or
a
llama
two
are
right
for
a
burro
and
three
for
an
average
mule
four
can
be
loaded
if
necessary
on
a
stout
mule
the
hospitable
mining
engineers
urged
us
to
prolong
our
stay
at
la
victoria
but
we
had
to
hasten
on
leaving
the
pleasant
shade
trees
of
caraveli
we
climbed
the
barren
desolate
hills
of
coarse
gravel
and
lava
rock
and
left
the
canyon
we
were
surprised
to
find
near
the
top
of
the
rise
the
scattered
foundations
of
fifty
little
circular
or
oval
huts
averaging
eight
feet
in
diameter
there
was
no
water
near
here
hardly
a
green
thing
of
any
sort
was
to
be
seen
in
the
vicinity
yet
here
had
once
been
a
village
it
seemed
to
belong
to
the
same
period
as
that
found
on
the
southern
slopes
of
the
parinacochas
basin
the
road
was
one
of
the
worst
we
encountered
anywhere
being
at
times
merely
a
rough
rocky
trail
over
and
among
huge
piles
of
lava
blocks
several
of
the
larger
boulders
were
covered
with
pictographs
they
represented
a
serpent
and
a
sun
besides
men
and
animals
shortly
afterwards
we
descended
to
the
rio
grande
valley
at
callanga
where
we
pitched
our
camps
among
the
most
extensive
ruins
that
i
have
seen
in
the
coastal
desert
they
covered
an
area
of
one
hundred
acres
the
houses
being
crowded
closely
together
it
gave
one
a
strange
sensation
to
find
such
a
very
large
metropolis
in
what
is
now
a
desolate
region
the
general
appearance
of
callanga
was
strikingly
reminiscent
of
some
of
the
large
groups
of
ruins
in
our
own
southwest
nothing
about
it
indicated
inca
origin
there
were
no
terraces
in
the
vicinity
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
what
such
a
large
population
could
have
done
here
or
how
they
lived
the
walls
were
of
compact
cobblestones
and
stuccoed
with
adobe
and
sand
most
of
the
stucco
had
come
off
some
of
the
houses
had
seats
or
small
built
up
at
one
end
others
contained
two
or
three
small
cells
possibly
storerooms
with
neither
doors
nor
windows
we
found
a
number
of
burial
cists
some
square
others
rounded
lined
with
small
cobblestones
in
one
house
at
the
foot
of
cellar
stairs
we
found
a
subterranean
room
or
tomb
the
entrance
to
it
was
covered
with
a
single
stone
lintel
in
examining
this
tomb
tucker
had
a
narrow
escape
from
being
bitten
by
a
boba
a
venomous
snake
nearly
three
feet
in
length
with
vicious
mouth
long
fangs
like
a
rattlesnake
and
a
strikingly
mottled
skin
at
one
place
there
was
a
low
pyramid
less
than
ten
feet
in
height
to
its
top
led
a
flight
of
rude
stone
steps
among
the
ruins
we
found
a
number
of
broken
stone
dishes
rudely
carved
out
of
soft
highly
porous
scoriaceous
lava
the
dishes
must
have
been
hard
to
keep
clean
we
also
found
a
small
stone
mortar
probably
used
for
grinding
paint
a
broken
stone
war
club
and
a
broken
compact
stone
mortar
and
pestle
possibly
used
for
grinding
corn
two
stones
a
foot
and
a
half
long
roughly
rounded
with
a
shallow
groove
across
the
middle
of
the
flatter
sides
resembled
sinkers
used
by
fishermen
to
hold
down
large
nets
although
ten
times
larger
than
any
i
had
ever
seen
used
perhaps
they
were
to
tie
down
roofs
in
a
gale
there
were
a
few
potsherds
lying
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
so
weathered
as
to
have
lost
whatever
decoration
they
once
had
we
did
no
excavating
callanga
offers
an
interesting
field
for
archeological
investigation
unfortunately
we
had
heard
nothing
of
it
previously
came
upon
it
unexpectedly
and
had
but
little
time
to
give
it
after
the
first
night
camp
in
the
midst
of
the
dead
city
we
made
the
discovery
that
although
it
seemed
to
be
entirely
deserted
it
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
well
populated
i
was
reminded
of
professor
seymour
story
of
his
studies
in
the
ruins
of
ancient
greece
we
wondered
what
the
fleas
live
on
ordinarily
our
next
was
the
small
town
of
andaray
whose
thatched
houses
are
built
chiefly
of
stone
plastered
with
mud
near
it
we
encountered
two
men
with
a
mule
which
they
said
they
were
taking
into
town
to
sell
and
were
willing
to
dispose
of
cheaply
the
tejadas
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
buy
a
good
animal
at
a
bargain
although
the
circumstances
were
suspicious
drawing
on
us
for
six
gold
sovereigns
they
smilingly
added
the
new
mule
to
the
pack
train
only
to
discover
on
reaching
chuquibamba
that
they
had
purchased
it
from
thieves
we
were
able
to
clear
our
arrieros
of
any
complicity
in
the
theft
nevertheless
the
owner
of
the
stolen
mule
was
unwilling
to
pay
anything
for
its
return
so
they
lost
their
bargain
and
their
gold
we
spent
one
night
in
chuquibamba
with
our
friend
señor
benavides
the
and
once
more
took
up
the
route
to
arequipa
we
left
the
majes
valley
in
the
afternoon
and
as
before
spent
the
night
crossing
the
desert
about
three
in
the
morning
after
we
had
been
jogging
steadily
along
for
about
twelve
hours
in
the
dark
and
quiet
of
the
night
the
only
sound
the
shuffle
of
the
mules
feet
in
the
sand
the
only
sight
an
occasional
dune
dimly
visible
in
the
starlight
the
eastern
horizon
began
to
be
faintly
illumined
the
moon
had
long
since
set
could
this
be
the
approach
of
dawn
sunrise
was
not
due
for
at
least
two
hours
in
the
tropics
there
is
little
twilight
preceding
the
day
the
dawn
comes
up
like
thunder
surely
the
moon
could
not
be
going
to
rise
again
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
the
rapidly
brightening
eastern
sky
while
we
watched
and
marveled
the
pure
white
light
grew
brighter
and
brighter
until
we
cried
out
in
ecstasy
as
a
dazzling
luminary
rose
majestically
above
the
horizon
a
splendor
neither
of
the
sun
nor
of
the
moon
shone
upon
us
it
was
the
morning
star
for
sheer
beauty
divine
enchanting
ravishment
venus
that
day
surpassed
anything
i
have
ever
seen
in
the
words
of
the
great
eastern
poet
who
had
often
seen
such
a
sight
in
the
deserts
of
asia
the
morning
stars
sang
together
and
all
the
sons
of
god
shouted
for
joy

they

the

is
always
present
in
the
subconscious
mind
of
the
arequipeño
one
evening
i
happened
to
be
dining
with
a
friend
at
the
hospitable
arequipa
club
suddenly
the
windows
rattled
violently
and
we
heard
a
loud
explosion
at
least
that
is
what
it
sounded
like
to
me
to
the
members
of
the
club
however
it
meant
only
one
thing
an
earthquake
everybody
rushed
out
the
streets
were
already
crowded
with
hysterical
people
crying
shouting
and
running
toward
the
great
open
plaza
in
front
of
the
beautiful
cathedral
here
some
dropped
on
their
knees
in
gratitude
at
having
escaped
from
falling
walls
others
prayed
to
the
god
of
earthquakes
to
spare
their
city
yet
no
walls
had
fallen
in
the
business
district
a
great
column
of
black
smoke
was
rising
gradually
it
became
known
to
the
throngs
that
the
noise
and
the
trembling
had
not
been
due
to
an
earthquake
but
to
an
explosion
in
a
large
warehouse
which
had
contained
gasoline
kerosene
dynamite
and
giant
powder
in
this
city
of
people
the

very
rare
not
even
annual
scarcely
biennial
that
there
were
no
fire
engines
a
bucket
brigade
was
formed
and
tried
to
quench
the
roaring
furnace
by
dipping
water
from
one
of
the
azequias
or
canals
that
run
through
the
streets
the
fire
continued
to
belch
forth
dense
masses
of
smoke
and
flame
in
any
american
city
such
a
blaze
would
certainly
become
a
great
conflagration
while
the
fire
was
at
its
height
i
went
into
the
adjoining
building
to
see
whether
any
help
could
be
rendered
to
my
utter
amazement
the
surface
of
the
wall
next
to
the
fiery
furnace
was
not
even
warm
such
is
the
result
of
building
houses
with
massive
walls
of
stone
furthermore
the
roofs
in
arequipa
are
of
tiles
consequently
no
harm
was
done
by
sparks
so
without
a
fire
department
this
really
terrible
fire
was
limited
to
one
warehouse
the
next
day
the
newspapers
talked
about
the
dire
necessity
of
securing
fire
engines
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
see
what
good
a
fire
engine
could
have
done
nothing
could
have
saved
the
warehouse
itself
once
the
fire
got
under
way
and
surely
the
houses
next
door
would
have
suffered
more
had
they
been
deluged
with
streams
of
water
the
facts
are
almost
incredible
to
an
american
we
take
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
cities
should
have
fires
and
explosions
in
arequipa
everybody
thought
it
was
an
earthquake
a
day
run
by
an
excellent
railroad
takes
one
to
puno
the
chief
port
of
lake
titicaca
elevation
feet
puno
boasts
a
monument
and
a
new
theater
really
a
movie
palace
there
is
a
good
harbor
although
dredging
is
necessary
to
provide
for
steamers
like
the
inca
repairs
to
the
lake
boats
are
made
on
a
marine
or
rather
a
lacustrine
railway
the
bay
of
puno
grows
quantities
of
totoras
giant
bulrushes
sometimes
twelve
feet
long
ages
ago
the
lake
dwellers
learned
to
dry
the
totoras
tie
them
securely
in
long
bundles
fasten
the
bundles
together
turn
up
the
ends
fix
smaller
bundles
along
the
sides
as
a
and
so
construct
a
or
balsa
of
course
the
balsas
eventually
become
and
spend
a
large
part
of
their
existence
on
the
shore
drying
in
the
sun
even
so
they
are
not
very
buoyant
i
can
testify
that
it
is
difficult
to
use
them
without
getting
one
shoes
wet
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
should
go
barefooted
or
wear
sandals
as
the
natives
do
the
balsas
are
clumsy
and
difficult
to
paddle
the
favorite
method
of
locomotion
is
to
pole
or
when
the
wind
favors
sail
the
mast
is
an
contraption
twelve
feet
high
made
of
two
light
poles
tied
together
and
fastened
one
to
each
side
of
the
craft
slightly
forward
of
amidships
poles
are
extremely
scarce
in
this
region
lumber
has
to
be
brought
from
puget
sound
miles
away
so
nearly
all
the
masts
i
saw
were
made
of
small
pieces
of
wood
spliced
two
or
three
times
to
the
apex
of
the
a
is
attached
a
forked
stick
over
which
run
the
halyards
the
rectangular
sail
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
large
mat
made
of
rushes
a
short
forestay
fastened
to
the
sides
of
the
a
about
four
feet
above
the
hull
prevents
the
mast
from
falling
when
the
sail
is
hoisted
the
main
halyards
take
the
place
of
a
backstay
the
balsas
can
not
beat
to
windward
but
behave
very
well
in
shallow
water
with
a
favoring
breeze
when
the
wind
is
contrary
the
boatmen
must
pole
they
are
extremely
careful
not
to
fall
overboard
for
the
water
in
the
lake
is
cold
and
none
of
them
know
how
to
swim
lake
titicaca
itself
never
freezes
over
although
during
the
winter
ice
forms
at
night
on
the
shallow
bays
and
near
the
shore
figure
a
lake
titicaca
balsa
at
puno
figure
a
niche
on
the
island
of
koati
when
the
indians
wish
to
go
in
the
shallowest
waters
they
use
a
very
small
balsa
not
over
eight
feet
long
barely
capable
of
supporting
the
weight
of
one
man
on
the
other
hand
large
balsas
constructed
for
use
in
crossing
the
rough
waters
of
the
deeper
portions
of
the
lake
are
capable
of
carrying
a
dozen
people
and
their
luggage
once
i
saw
a
ploughman
and
his
team
of
oxen
being
ferried
across
the
lake
on
a
bulrush
raft
to
give
greater
security
two
balsas
are
sometimes
fastened
together
in
the
fashion
of
a
double
canoe
one
of
the
more
highly
speculative
of
the
bolivian
writers
señor
posnansky
of
la
paz
believes
that
gigantic
balsas
were
used
in
bringing
monoliths
across
the
lake
to
tiahuanaco
this
theory
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
titicaca
was
once
very
much
higher
than
it
is
now
a
hypothesis
which
has
not
commended
itself
to
modern
geologists
or
geographers
isaiah
bowman
and
professor
herbert
gregory
who
have
studied
its
geology
and
physiography
have
not
been
able
to
find
any
direct
evidence
of
former
high
levels
for
lake
titicaca
or
of
its
having
been
connected
with
the
ocean
nevertheless
señor
posnansky
believes
that
lake
titicaca
was
once
a
salt
sea
which
became
separated
from
the
ocean
as
the
andes
rose
the
fact
that
the
lake
fishes
are
rather
than
marine
forms
does
not
bother
him
señor
posnansky
pins
his
faith
to
a
small
dried
seahorse
once
given
him
by
a
titicaca
fisherman
he
seems
to
forget
that
dried
specimens
of
marine
life
including
starfish
are
frequently
offered
for
sale
in
the
andes
by
the
dealers
in
primitive
medicines
who
may
be
found
in
almost
every
probably
señor
seahorse
was
brought
from
the
ocean
by
some
particularly
enterprising
trader
although
starfish
are
common
enough
in
the
andes
and
a
seahorse
has
actually
found
its
in
la
paz
this
does
not
alter
the
fact
that
scientific
investigators
have
never
found
any
strictly
marine
fauna
in
lake
titicaca
on
the
other
hand
it
has
two
or
three
kinds
of
edible
fish
one
of
them
belongs
to
a
species
found
in
the
rimac
river
near
lima
it
seems
to
me
entirely
possible
that
the
incas
with
their
scorn
of
the
difficulties
of
carrying
heavy
burdens
over
seemingly
impossible
trails
might
have
deliberately
transplanted
the
desirable
fishes
of
the
rimac
river
to
lake
titicaca
polo
de
ondegardo
who
lived
in
cuzco
in
says
that
the
incas
used
to
bring
fresh
fish
from
the
sea
by
special
runners
and
that
they
have
records
in
their
quipus
of
the
fish
having
been
brought
from
tumbez
a
distance
of
more
than
three
hundred
leagues
the
actual
transference
of
water
jars
containing
the
fish
would
have
offered
no
serious
obstacle
whatever
to
the
incas
provided
the
idea
happened
to
appeal
to
them
as
desirable
yet
i
may
be
as
far
wrong
as
señor
posnansky
at
any
rate
the
romantic
stories
of
a
gigantic
inland
sea
vastly
more
extensive
than
the
present
lake
and
actually
surrounding
the
ancient
city
of
tiahuanaco
must
be
treated
with
respectful
skepticism
tiahuanaco
at
the
southern
end
of
lake
titicaca
in
bolivia
is
famous
for
the
remains
of
a
civilization
unique
among
prehistoric
remains
in
the
highlands
of
peru
or
bolivia
are
its
carved
monolithic
images
although
they
have
suffered
from
weathering
and
from
vandalism
enough
remains
to
show
that
they
represent
clothed
human
figures
the
richly
decorated
girdles
and
long
tunics
are
carved
in
low
relief
with
an
intricate
pattern
while
some
of
the
designs
are
undoubtedly
symbolic
of
the
rank
achievements
or
attributes
of
the
divinities
or
chiefs
here
portrayed
there
is
nothing
hieroglyphic
the
images
are
stiff
and
show
no
appreciation
of
the
beauty
of
the
human
form
probably
the
ancient
artists
never
had
an
opportunity
to
study
the
human
body
in
andean
villages
even
little
children
do
not
go
naked
as
they
do
among
primitive
peoples
who
live
in
warm
climates
the
highlanders
of
peru
and
bolivia
are
always
heavily
clothed
day
and
night
forced
by
their
climate
to
seek
comfort
in
the
amount
and
thickness
of
their
apparel
they
have
developed
an
excessive
modesty
in
regard
to
bodily
exposure
which
is
in
striking
contrast
to
people
who
live
on
the
warm
sands
of
the
south
seas
inca
sculptors
and
potters
rarely
employed
the
human
body
as
a
motif
tiahuanaco
is
yet
even
here
the
images
are
clothed
they
were
not
represented
as
clothed
in
order
to
make
easier
the
work
of
the
sculptor
his
carving
shows
he
had
great
skill
was
observant
and
had
true
artistic
feeling
apparently
the
taboo
against
nakedness
was
too
much
for
him
among
the
islands
in
lake
titicaca
some
belong
to
peru
others
to
bolivia
two
of
the
latter
titicaca
and
koati
were
peculiarly
venerated
in
inca
days
they
are
covered
with
artificial
terraces
most
of
which
are
still
used
by
the
indian
farmers
of
on
both
islands
there
are
ruins
of
important
inca
structures
on
titicaca
island
i
was
shown
two
caves
out
of
which
say
the
indians
came
the
sun
and
moon
at
their
creation
these
caves
are
not
large
enough
for
a
man
to
stand
upright
but
to
a
people
who
do
not
appreciate
the
size
of
the
heavenly
bodies
it
requires
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
to
believe
that
those
bright
disks
came
forth
from
caves
eight
feet
wide
the
myth
probably
originated
with
dwellers
on
the
western
shore
of
the
lake
who
would
often
see
the
sun
or
moon
rise
over
this
island
on
an
ancient
road
that
runs
across
the
island
my
native
guide
pointed
out
the
footprints
of
the
sun
and
moon
two
curious
effects
of
erosion
which
bear
a
distant
resemblance
to
the
footprints
of
giants
twenty
or
thirty
feet
tall
the
indians
known
as
aymaras
seem
to
be
and
fairly
cheerful
the
impression
which
bandelier
gives
in
his
islands
of
titicaca
and
koati
of
the
degradation
and
surly
character
of
these
indians
was
not
apparent
at
the
time
of
my
short
visit
in
it
is
quite
possible
however
that
if
i
had
to
live
among
the
indians
as
he
did
for
several
months
digging
up
their
ancient
places
of
worship
disturbing
their
superstitious
prejudices
and
possibly
upsetting
in
their
minds
the
proper
balance
between
wet
weather
and
dry
i
might
have
brought
upon
myself
uncivil
looks
and
rough
churlish
treatment
such
as
he
experienced
in
judging
the
attitude
of
mind
of
the
natives
of
titicaca
one
should
remember
that
they
live
under
most
trying
conditions
of
climate
and
environment
during
several
months
of
the
year
everything
is
dried
up
and
parched
the
brilliant
sun
of
the
tropics
burning
mercilessly
through
the
rarefied
air
causes
the
scant
vegetation
to
wither
then
come
torrential
rains
i
shall
never
forget
my
first
experience
on
lake
titicaca
when
the
steamer
encountered
a
rain
squall
the
resulting
deluge
actually
came
through
the
decks
needless
to
say
such
downpours
tend
to
wash
away
the
soil
which
the
farmers
have
painfully
gathered
for
field
or
garden
the
sun
in
the
daytime
is
extremely
hot
yet
the
difference
in
temperature
between
sun
and
shade
is
excessive
furthermore
the
winds
at
night
are
very
damp
the
cold
is
intensely
penetrating
fuel
is
exceedingly
scarce
there
is
barely
enough
for
cooking
purposes
and
none
for
artificial
heat
food
is
hard
to
get
few
crops
can
be
grown
at
feet
some
barley
is
raised
but
the
soil
is
lacking
in
nitrogen
the
principal
crop
is
the
bitter
white
potato
which
after
being
frozen
and
dried
becomes
the
insipid
chuño
chief
reliance
of
the
poorer
families
the
inca
system
of
bringing
guano
from
the
islands
of
the
pacific
coast
has
long
since
been
abandoned
there
is
no
money
to
pay
for
modern
fertilizers
consequently
crops
are
poor
on
titicaca
island
i
saw
native
women
who
had
just
harvested
their
maize
engaged
in
shucking
and
drying
ears
of
corn
which
varied
in
length
from
one
to
three
inches
to
be
sure
this
miniature
corn
has
the
advantage
of
maturing
in
sixty
days
but
good
soil
and
fertilizers
would
double
its
size
and
productiveness
naturally
these
indians
always
feel
themselves
at
the
mercy
of
the
elements
either
a
long
rainy
season
or
a
drought
may
cause
acute
hunger
and
extreme
suffering
consequently
one
must
not
blame
the
bolivian
or
peruvian
highlander
if
he
frequently
appears
to
be
sullen
and
morose
on
the
other
hand
one
ought
not
to
praise
samoans
for
being
happy
hospitable
and
those
fortunate
polynesians
are
surrounded
by
warm
waters
in
which
they
can
always
enjoy
a
swim
trees
from
which
delicious
food
can
always
be
obtained
and
cocoanuts
from
which
cooling
drinks
are
secured
without
cost
who
could
not
develop
cheerfulness
under
such
conditions
on
the
small
island
koati
some
of
the
inca
stonework
is
remarkably
good
and
has
several
unusual
features
such
as
the
elaboration
of
the
large
reëntrant
ceremonial
niches
formed
by
arches
one
within
the
other
small
ornamental
niches
are
used
to
break
the
space
between
these
recesses
and
the
upper
corners
of
the
whole
rectangle
containing
them
also
unusual
are
the
niches
between
the
doorways
made
in
the
form
of
an
elaborate
quadrate
cross
it
might
seem
at
first
glance
as
though
this
feature
showed
spanish
influence
since
a
papal
cross
is
created
by
the
shadow
cast
in
the
intervening
recessed
courses
within
their
design
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
cross
nowy
quadrant
is
a
natural
outcome
of
using
for
ornamental
purposes
the
design
both
erect
and
inverted
all
over
the
land
of
the
incas
one
finds
flights
of
steps
or
terraces
used
repeatedly
for
ornamental
or
ceremonial
purposes
some
stairs
are
large
enough
to
be
used
by
man
others
are
in
miniature
frequently
the
steps
were
cut
into
the
sacred
boulders
consecrated
to
ancestor
worship
it
was
easy
for
an
inca
architect
accustomed
to
the
stairway
motif
to
have
conceived
these
curious
doorways
on
koati
and
also
the
niches
between
them
even
if
he
had
never
seen
any
representation
of
a
papal
cross
or
a
cross
nowy
quadrant
my
friend
bancel
la
farge
has
also
suggested
a
striking
resemblance
which
the
niches
bear
to
arabic
or
moorish
architecture
as
shown
for
instance
in
the
court
of
the
lions
in
the
alhambra
the
arch
is
distinctly
oriental
in
form
yet
flights
of
steps
or
terraces
are
also
thoroughly
incaic
the
principal
structure
on
koati
was
built
around
three
sides
of
a
small
plaza
constructed
on
an
artificial
terrace
in
a
slight
depression
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
island
the
fourth
side
is
open
and
affords
a
magnificent
view
of
the
lake
and
the
wonderful
cordillera
real
miles
long
and
nowhere
less
than
feet
high
this
range
of
lofty
of
surpassing
beauty
culminates
in
mt
sorata
feet
high
to
the
worshipers
of
the
sun
and
moon
who
came
to
the
sacred
islands
for
some
of
their
most
elaborate
religious
ceremonies
the
sight
of
those
heavenly
luminaries
rising
over
the
majestic
snow
mountains
their
glories
reflected
in
the
shining
waters
of
the
lake
must
have
been
a
sublime
spectacle
on
such
occasions
the
little
plaza
would
indeed
have
been
worth
seeing
we
may
imagine
the
gayly
caparisoned
incas
their
faces
lit
up
by
the
colors
of
dawn
daughter
of
the
morning
their
ceremonial
formation
sharply
outlined
against
the
high
decorated
walls
of
the
buildings
behind
them
perhaps
the
rulers
and
high
priests
had
special
stations
in
front
of
the
large
niches
one
may
be
sure
that
a
people
who
were
fond
of
bright
colors
who
were
able
to
manufacture
exquisite
textiles
and
who
loved
to
decorate
their
garments
with
spangles
and
disks
of
beaten
gold
would
have
lost
no
opportunity
for
making
the
ancient
ceremonies
truly
resplendent
on
the
peninsula
of
copacabana
opposite
the
sacred
islands
a
great
annual
pageant
is
still
staged
every
august
although
at
present
connected
with
a
pious
pilgrimage
to
the
shrine
of
the
miraculous
image
of
the
virgin
of
copacabana
this
vivid
spectacle
the
most
celebrated
fair
in
all
south
america
has
its
origin
in
the
dim
past
it
comes
after
the
maize
is
harvested
and
corresponds
to
our
thanksgiving
festival
the
scene
is
laid
in
the
plaza
in
front
of
a
large
bizarre
church
during
the
first
ten
days
in
august
there
are
gathered
here
thousands
of
the
mountain
folk
from
far
and
near
everything
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
aymara
indian
is
offered
for
sale
including
quantities
of
his
favorite
beverages
traders
usually
women
sit
in
long
rows
on
blankets
laid
on
the
cobblestone
pavement
some
of
them
are
protected
from
the
sun
by
primitive
umbrellas
consisting
of
a
square
cotton
sheet
stretched
over
a
bamboo
frame
in
one
row
are
those
traders
who
sell
parched
and
popped
corn
in
another
those
who
deal
in
sandals
and
shoes
the
simple
gear
of
the
humblest
wayfarer
and
the
elaborately
decorated
boots
affected
by
the
wealthy
chola
women
of
la
paz
in
another
row
are
the
dealers
in
indian
blankets
still
another
is
devoted
to
such
trinkets
as
one
might
expect
to
find
in
a
shop
at
home
there
are
stolid
aymara
peddlers
with
scores
of
bamboo
flutes
varying
in
size
from
a
piccolo
to
a
bassoon
the
hat
merchants
with
piles
of
freshly
made
native
felts
warranted
to
last
for
at
least
a
year
and
vendors
of
aniline
dyes
the
fabrics
which
have
come
to
us
from
inca
times
are
colored
with
beautifully
soft
vegetable
dyes
among
inca
ruins
one
may
find
small
stone
mortars
in
which
the
primitive
pigments
were
ground
and
mixed
with
infinite
care
although
the
modern
indian
still
prefers
the
product
of
hand
looms
he
has
been
quick
to
adopt
the
harsh
aniline
dyes
which
are
not
only
easier
to
secure
but
produce
more
striking
results
as
a
citizen
of
connecticut
it
gave
me
quite
a
start
to
see
carelessly
exposed
to
the
weather
on
the
rough
cobblestones
of
the
plaza
bright
new
hardware
from
new
haven
and
new
britain
locks
keys
spring
scales
bolts
screw
eyes
hooks
and
other
wooden
nutmegs
at
the
tables
of
the
just
outside
of
the
sacred
enclosure
are
the
real
moneymakers
who
give
nothing
for
something
and
do
a
brisk
business
and
stand
ready
to
fleece
the
guileless
native
or
the
unsuspecting
foreigner
the
operators
may
wear
ragged
ponchos
and
appear
to
be
incapable
of
deep
designs
but
they
know
all
the
tricks
of
the
trade
the
most
striking
feature
of
the
fair
is
the
presence
of
various
aymara
secret
societies
whose
members
wearing
repulsive
masks
are
clad
in
the
most
extraordinary
costumes
which
can
be
invented
by
primitive
imaginations
each
society
has
its
own
uniform
made
up
of
tinsels
and
figured
satins
gold
and
silver
leaf
gaudy
textiles
magnificent
epaulets
bearing
large
golden
stars
on
a
background
of
silver
decorated
with
glittering
gems
of
colored
glass
tinted
ostrich
plumes
of
many
colors
sticking
straight
up
eighteen
inches
above
the
heads
of
their
wearers
gaudy
ribbons
beruffled
bodices
puffed
sleeves
and
slashed
trunks
some
of
these
strange
costumes
are
actually
reminiscent
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
wearers
are
provided
with
flutes
whistles
cymbals
flageolets
snare
drums
and
rattles
or
other
the
result
is
an
indescribable
hubbub
a
garish
human
kaleidoscope
accompanied
by
fiendish
clamor
and
unmusical
noises
which
fairly
outstrip
a
dozen
jazz
bands
it
is
bedlam
let
loose
a
scene
of
wild
uproar
and
confusion
the
members
of
one
group
were
dressed
to
represent
female
angels
their
heads
tightly
turbaned
so
as
to
bear
the
maximum
number
of
tall
waving
variegated
plumes
on
their
backs
were
gaudy
wings
resembling
the
butterflies
of
children
pantomimes
many
wore
colored
goggles
they
marched
solemnly
around
the
plaza
playing
on
bamboo
flageolets
their
plaintive
tunes
drowned
in
the
din
of
big
bass
drums
and
blatant
trumpets
in
an
eddy
in
the
seething
crowd
was
a
aymara
bedecked
in
the
most
tawdry
manner
with
gewgaws
from
birmingham
or
manchester
sedately
playing
a
melancholy
tune
on
a
rustic
syrinx
or
pan
pipe
charmingly
made
from
little
tubes
of
bamboo
from
eastern
bolivia
at
the
close
of
the
festival
on
a
sunday
afternoon
the
costumes
disappear
and
there
occurs
a
strong
temporary
barriers
are
erected
at
the
comers
of
the
plaza
householders
bar
their
doors
a
riotous
crowd
composed
of
hundreds
of
well
fortified
with
dutch
courage
gathers
for
the
fray
all
are
ready
to
run
in
every
direction
should
the
bull
take
it
into
his
head
to
charge
toward
them
it
is
not
a
bullfight
there
are
no
picadors
armed
with
lances
to
prick
the
bull
to
madness
no
banderilleros
with
barbed
darts
no
heroic
matador
ready
with
shining
blade
to
give
a
mad
and
weary
bull
the
coup
de
grace
here
all
is
fun
and
frolic
to
be
sure
the
bull
is
duly
annoyed
by
boastful
boys
or
drunken
aymaras
who
prod
him
with
sticks
and
shake
bright
ponchos
in
his
face
until
he
dashes
after
his
tormentors
and
causes
a
mighty
scattering
of
some
spectators
amid
shrieks
of
delight
from
everybody
else
when
one
animal
gets
tired
another
is
brought
on
there
is
no
chance
of
a
bull
being
wounded
or
seriously
hurt
at
the
time
of
our
visit
the
only
animal
who
seemed
at
all
anxious
to
do
real
damage
was
let
alone
he
showed
no
disposition
to
charge
at
random
into
the
crowds
the
spectators
surrounded
the
plaza
so
thickly
that
he
could
not
distinguish
any
one
particular
enemy
on
whom
to
vent
his
rage
he
galloped
madly
after
any
individual
who
crossed
the
plaza
five
or
six
bulls
were
let
loose
during
the
excitement
but
no
harm
was
done
and
every
one
had
an
uproariously
good
time
such
is
the
spectacle
of
copacabana
a
mixture
of
business
and
pleasure
pagan
and
christian
spain
and
titicaca
bedlam
is
not
pleasant
to
one
ears
yet
to
see
the
staid
mountain
herdsmen
attired
in
plumes
petticoats
epaulets
and
goggles
blowing
mightily
with
lips
on
bamboo
flageolets
is
worth
a
long
journey
chapter

the
vilcanota
country

the
peruvian

in
the
northernmost

are
the
grassy
foothills
of
the
cordillera

where
large
herds
of

santa

here
come

the
high

which
alpaca

excellent
blankets
renowned
in
southern

for
their
weight
and
texture
are
made
here
on
hand
looms
notwithstanding
the
altitude
nearly
as
great
as
the
top
of

peak
the
stocky
inhabitants
of

are
hardy
vigorous
and
energetic
ricardo
charaja
the
best
quichua
assistant
we
ever
had
came
from
santa
rosa
nearly
all
the
citizens
are
of
pure
indian
stock
they
own
many
fine
llamas
there
is
abundant
pasturage
and
the
llamas
are
well
cared
for
by
the
indians
who
become
personally
attached
to
their
flocks
and
are
loath
to
part
with
any
of
the
individuals
once
i
attempted
through
a
cuzco
acquaintance
to
secure
the
skin
and
skeleton
of
a
fine
llama
for
the
yale
museum
my
friend
was
favorably
known
and
spoke
the
quichua
language
fluently
he
offered
a
good
price
and
obtained
from
various
llama
owners
promises
to
bring
the
hide
and
bones
of
one
of
their
camels
for
shipment
but
they
never
did
apparently
they
regarded
it
as
unlucky
to
kill
a
llama
and
none
happened
to
die
at
the
right
time
the
llamas
never
show
affection
for
their
masters
as
horses
often
do
on
the
other
hand
i
have
never
seen
a
llama
kick
or
bite
at
his
owner
the
llama
was
the
only
beast
of
burden
known
in
either
north
or
south
america
before
columbus
it
was
found
by
the
spaniards
in
all
parts
of
inca
land
its
small
feet
with
their
rough
pads
enable
it
to
walk
easily
on
slopes
too
rough
or
steep
for
even
a
mule
it
has
the
reputation
of
being
an
unpleasant
pet
due
to
its
ability
to
sneeze
or
spit
for
a
considerable
distance
a
small
quantity
of
acrid
saliva
when
i
was
in
college
circus
came
to
town
the
menagerie
included
a
dozen
llamas
whose
supercilious
expression
inoffensive
looks
and
small
size
they
are
only
three
feet
high
at
the
shoulder
tempted
some
little
urchins
to
tease
them
when
the
llamas
felt
that
the
time
had
come
for
reprisals
their
aim
was
straight
and
the
result
a
precipitate
retreat
their
tormentors
howling
and
rubbing
their
eyes
had
to
run
home
and
wash
their
faces
curiously
enough
in
the
two
years
which
i
have
spent
in
the
peruvian
highlands
i
have
never
seen
a
llama
so
attack
a
single
human
being
on
the
other
hand
when
i
was
in
santa
rosa
in
some
one
had
a
tame
vicuña
which
was
perfectly
willing
to
sneeze
straight
at
any
stranger
who
came
within
twenty
feet
of
it
even
if
one
motive
was
nothing
more
annoying
than
scientific
curiosity
the
vicuña
is
the
smallest
american
camel
yet
its
long
slender
neck
small
head
long
legs
and
small
body
from
which
hangs
long
feathery
fleece
make
it
look
more
like
an
ostrich
than
a
camel
in
the
churchyard
of
santa
rosa
are
two
or
three
gnarled
trees
which
have
been
carefully
preserved
for
centuries
as
objects
of
respect
and
veneration
some
travelers
have
thought
that
feet
is
above
the
tree
line
but
the
presence
of
these
trees
at
santa
rosa
would
seem
to
show
that
the
use
of
the
words
tree
line
is
a
misnomer
in
the
andes
cook
believes
that
the
peruvian
plateau
with
the
exception
of
the
coastal
deserts
was
once
well
covered
with
forests
when
man
first
came
into
the
andes
everything
except
rocky
ledges
snow
fields
and
glaciers
was
covered
with
forest
growth
although
many
districts
are
now
entirely
treeless
cook
found
that
the
conditions
of
light
heat
and
moisture
even
at
the
highest
elevations
are
sufficient
to
support
the
growth
of
trees
also
that
there
is
ample
fertility
of
soil
his
theories
are
well
substantiated
by
several
isolated
tracts
of
forests
which
i
found
growing
alongside
of
glaciers
at
very
high
elevations
one
forest
in
particular
on
the
slopes
of
mt
soiroccocha
has
been
accurately
determined
by
bumstead
to
be
over
feet
above
sea
level
it
is
cut
off
from
the
inhabited
valley
by
rock
falls
and
precipices
so
it
has
not
been
available
for
fuel
virgin
forests
are
not
known
to
exist
in
the
peruvian
highlands
on
any
lands
which
could
have
been
cultivated
a
certain
amount
of
natural
reforestation
with
native
trees
is
taking
place
on
abandoned
agricultural
terraces
in
some
of
the
high
valleys
although
these
trees
belong
to
many
different
species
and
families
cook
found
that
they
all
have
this
striking
peculiarity
when
cut
down
they
sprout
readily
from
the
stumps
and
are
able
to
survive
repeated
pollarding
remarkable
evidence
of
the
fact
that
the
primeval
forests
of
peru
were
long
ago
cut
down
for
fuel
or
burned
over
for
agriculture
near
the
santa
rosa
trees
is
a
tall
the
sight
of
a
picturesque
belfry
with
four
or
five
bells
of
different
sizes
hanging
each
in
its
respective
window
makes
a
strong
appeal
it
is
quite
otherwise
on
sunday
mornings
when
these
same
bells
out
of
tune
with
themselves
or
actually
cracked
are
all
rung
at
the
same
time
the
resulting
clangor
and
din
is
unforgettable
i
presume
the
chinese
would
say
it
was
intended
to
drive
away
the
devils
and
surely
such
noise
must
be
thoroughly
uncongenial
even
to
the
most
irreclaimable
devil
as
lord
frederick
hamilton
said
of
the
canton
practices
church
bells
in
the
united
states
and
england
are
usually
and
intended
to
invite
the
hearer
to
come
to
service
or
else
they
ring
out
in
joyous
peals
to
announce
some
festive
occasion
there
is
nothing
inviting
or
joyous
about
the
bells
in
southern
peru
once
in
a
while
one
may
hear
a
bell
of
deep
sweet
tone
like
that
of
the
great
bell
in
cuzco
which
is
tolled
when
the
last
sacrament
is
being
administered
to
a
dying
christian
but
the
general
idea
of
in
this
part
of
the
world
seems
to
be
to
make
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
racket
and
clamor
on
popular
saints
days
this
is
accompanied
by
firecrackers
aerial
bombs
and
other
devices
which
again
remind
one
of
chinese
folkways
perhaps
it
is
merely
that
fundamental
fondness
for
making
a
noise
which
is
found
in
all
healthy
children
on
sunday
afternoon
the
plaza
of
santa
rosa
was
well
filled
with
quichua
many
of
whom
had
been
imbibing
freely
of
chicha
a
mild
native
brew
usually
made
from
ripe
corn
the
crowd
was
remarkably
and
given
to
an
unusual
amount
of
laughter
and
gayety
for
them
sunday
is
truly
a
day
of
rest
recreation
and
sociability
on
week
days
most
of
them
even
the
smaller
boys
are
off
on
the
mountain
pastures
watching
the
herds
whose
wool
brings
prosperity
to
santa
rosa
one
sometimes
finds
the
mountain
indians
on
sunday
afternoon
sodden
thoroughly
soaked
with
chicha
and
inclined
to
resent
the
presence
of
inquisitive
strangers
not
so
these
good
folk
of
santa
rosa
figure
indian
alcaldes
at
santa
rosa
figure
native
druggists
in
the
plaza
of
sicuani
to
be
sure
the
female
vendors
of
eggs
potatoes
peppers
and
sundry
native
vegetables
squatting
in
two
long
rows
on
the
plaza
did
not
enjoy
being
photographed
but
the
men
and
boys
crowded
eagerly
forward
very
much
interested
in
my
endeavors
some
of
the
indian
alcaldes
local
magistrates
elected
yearly
to
serve
as
the
responsible
officials
for
villages
or
tribal
precincts
were
very
helpful
and
armed
with
their
large
staffs
of
office
tried
to
bring
the
shy
retiring
women
of
the
to
stand
in
a
frightened
disgruntled
barefooted
group
before
the
camera
the
women
were
dressed
in
the
customary
tight
bodices
heavy
woolen
skirts
and
voluminous
petticoats
of
the
plateau
over
their
shoulders
were
pinned
heavy
woolen
shawls
woven
on
hand
looms
on
their
heads
were
reversible
pancake
hats
made
of
straw
covered
on
the
side
with
coarse
woolen
stuff
and
on
the
side
with
tinsel
and
velveteen
in
accordance
with
local
custom
tassels
and
fringes
hung
down
on
both
sides
it
is
said
that
the
first
inca
ordered
the
dresses
of
each
village
to
be
different
so
that
his
officials
might
know
to
which
tribe
an
indian
belonged
it
was
only
with
great
difficulty
and
by
the
combined
efforts
of
a
priest
the
gobernador
or
mayor
and
the
alcaldes
that
a
dozen
very
reluctant
females
were
finally
persuaded
to
face
the
camera
the
expression
of
their
faces
was
very
eloquent
some
were
highly
indignant
others
looked
foolish
or
supercilious
two
or
three
were
thoroughly
frightened
not
knowing
what
evil
might
befall
them
next
not
one
gave
any
evidence
of
enjoying
it
or
taking
the
matter
as
a
good
joke
although
that
was
the
attitude
assumed
by
all
their
male
acquaintances
in
fact
some
of
the
men
were
so
anxious
to
have
their
pictures
taken
that
they
followed
us
about
and
posed
on
the
edge
of
every
group
men
and
boys
all
wore
knitted
woolen
caps
with
ear
flaps
which
they
seldom
remove
either
day
or
night
on
top
of
these
were
large
felt
hats
turned
up
in
front
so
as
to
give
a
bold
aspect
to
their
husky
wearers
over
their
shoulders
were
heavy
woolen
ponchos
decorated
with
bright
stripes
their
trousers
end
abruptly
halfway
between
knee
and
ankle
a
convenient
style
for
herdsmen
who
have
to
walk
in
the
long
dewy
grasses
of
the
plateau
these
pantaloons
do
not
look
badly
when
worn
with
sandals
as
is
the
usual
custom
but
since
this
was
sunday
all
the
men
had
put
on
european
boots
which
did
not
come
up
to
the
bottom
of
their
trousers
and
produced
a
singular
effect
hardly
likely
to
become
fashionable
the
prosperity
of
the
town
was
also
shown
by
corrugated
iron
roofs
far
less
picturesque
than
thatch
or
tile
they
require
less
attention
and
give
greater
satisfaction
during
the
rainy
season
they
can
also
be
securely
bolted
to
the
rafters
on
this
plateau
we
frequently
noticed
that
a
thatched
roof
was
held
in
place
by
ropes
passed
over
the
house
and
weights
resting
on
the
roof
sometimes
to
the
peak
of
a
gable
are
fastened
crosses
tiny
flags
or
the
skulls
of
animals
probably
to
avert
the
evil
eye
or
bring
good
luck
horseshoes
do
not
seem
to
be
in
demand
horses
skulls
however
are
deemed
very
efficacious
on
the
rim
of
the
titicaca
basin
is
la
raya
the
watershed
is
so
level
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
say
whether
any
particular
raindrop
will
eventually
find
itself
in
lake
titicaca
or
in
the
atlantic
ocean
the
water
from
a
spring
near
the
railroad
station
of
araranca
flows
definitely
to
the
north
this
spring
may
be
said
to
be
one
of
the
sources
of
the
urubamba
river
an
important
affluent
of
the
ucayali
and
also
of
the
amazon
but
i
never
have
heard
it
referred
to
as
the
source
of
the
amazon
except
by
an
adventurous
lecturer
captain
blank
whose
moving
picture
entertainment
bore
the
alluring
title
from
the
source
to
the
mouth
of
the
amazon
as
most
of
his
pictures
of
wild
animals
in
the
jungle
looked
as
though
they
were
taken
in
the
zoölogical
gardens
at
para
and
the
exciting
tragedies
of
his
canoe
trip
were
actually
staged
near
a
friendly
hacienda
at
santa
ana
less
than
a
week
journey
from
cuzco
it
is
perhaps
unnecessary
to
censure
him
for
giving
this
particular
little
spring
such
a
pretentious
title
the
urubamba
river
is
known
by
various
names
to
the
people
who
live
on
its
banks
the
upper
portion
is
sometimes
spoken
of
as
the
vilcanota
a
term
which
applies
to
a
lake
as
well
as
to
the
peaks
of
the
cordillera
in
this
vicinity
the
lower
portion
was
called
by
the
incas
the
uilca
or
the
uilcamayu
near
the
of
la
raya
i
noticed
the
remains
of
an
interesting
wall
which
may
have
served
centuries
ago
to
divide
the
incas
of
cuzco
from
the
collas
or
warlike
tribes
of
the
titicaca
basin
in
places
the
wall
has
been
kept
in
repair
by
the
owners
of
grazing
lands
but
most
of
it
can
be
but
dimly
traced
across
the
valley
and
up
the
neighboring
slopes
to
the
cliffs
of
the
cordillera
vilcanota
it
was
built
of
rough
stones
near
the
historic
wall
are
the
ruins
of
ancient
houses
possibly
once
occupied
by
an
inca
garrison
i
observed
no
ashlars
among
the
ruins
nor
any
evidence
of
careful
masonry
it
seems
to
me
likely
that
it
was
a
hastily
fortification
serving
for
a
single
military
campaign
rather
than
any
permanent
affair
like
the
roman
wall
of
north
britain
or
the
great
wall
of
china
we
know
from
tradition
that
war
was
frequently
waged
between
the
peoples
of
the
titicaca
basin
and
those
of
the
urubamba
and
cuzco
valleys
it
is
possible
that
this
is
a
relic
of
one
of
those
wars
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
much
older
than
the
incas
montesinos
one
of
the
best
early
historians
tells
us
of
titu
yupanqui
pachacuti
vi
of
the
peruvian
amautas
rulers
who
long
preceded
the
incas
against
pachacuti
vi
there
came
about
large
hordes
of
fierce
soldiers
from
the
south
and
east
laying
waste
fields
and
capturing
cities
and
towns
evidently
barbarian
migrations
which
appear
to
have
continued
for
some
time
during
these
wars
the
ancient
civilization
which
had
been
built
up
with
so
much
care
and
difficulty
during
the
preceding
twenty
centuries
was
seriously
threatened
pachacuti
vi
more
religious
than
warlike
ruler
of
a
people
whose
great
achievements
had
been
agricultural
rather
than
military
was
frightened
by
his
soothsayers
and
priests
they
told
him
of
many
bad
omens
instead
of
inducing
him
to
follow
a
policy
of
military
preparedness
he
was
urged
to
make
sacrifices
to
the
deities
nevertheless
he
ordered
his
captains
to
fortify
the
strategic
points
and
make
preparations
for
defense
the
invaders
may
have
come
from
argentina
it
is
possible
that
they
were
spurred
on
by
hunger
and
famine
caused
by
the
gradual
exhaustion
of
forested
areas
and
the
subsequent
spread
of
untillable
grasslands
on
the
great
pampas
montesinos
indicates
that
many
of
the
people
who
came
up
into
the
highlands
at
that
time
were
seeking
arable
lands
for
their
crops
and
were
fleeing
from
a
race
of
giants
possibly
patagonians
or
araucanians
who
had
expelled
them
from
their
own
lands
on
their
journey
they
had
passed
over
plains
swamps
and
jungles
it
is
obvious
that
a
great
readjustment
of
the
aborigines
was
in
progress
the
governors
of
the
districts
through
which
these
hordes
passed
were
not
able
to
summon
enough
strength
to
resist
them
pachacuti
vi
assembled
the
larger
part
of
his
army
near
the
pass
of
la
raya
and
awaited
the
approach
of
the
enemy
if
the
accounts
given
in
montesinos
are
true
this
wall
near
la
raya
may
have
been
built
about
years
ago
by
the
chiefs
who
were
told
to
fortify
the
strategic
points
certainly
the
pass
of
la
raya
long
the
gateway
from
the
titicaca
basin
to
the
important
cities
and
towns
of
the
urubamba
basin
was
the
key
to
the
situation
it
is
probable
that
pachacuti
vi
drew
up
his
army
behind
this
wall
his
men
were
undoubtedly
armed
with
slings
the
weapon
most
familiar
to
the
highland
shepherds
the
invaders
however
carried
bows
and
arrows
more
effective
arms
swifter
more
difficult
to
see
less
easy
to
dodge
as
pachacuti
vi
was
carried
over
the
field
of
battle
on
a
golden
stretcher
encouraging
his
men
he
was
killed
by
an
arrow
his
army
was
routed
montesinos
states
that
only
five
hundred
escaped
leaving
behind
their
wounded
they
fled
to
a
healthy
place
where
there
was
a
cave
in
which
they
hid
the
precious
body
of
their
ruler
most
writers
believe
this
to
be
at
paccaritampu
where
there
are
caves
under
an
interesting
carved
rock
there
is
no
place
in
peru
which
still
bears
the
name
of
to
try
and
identify
it
with
some
of
the
ruins
which
do
exist
and
whose
modern
names
are
not
found
in
the
early
spanish
writers
has
been
one
of
the
principal
objects
of
my
expeditions
to
peru
as
will
be
described
in
subsequent
chapters

laying
down
the
warp
for
a
blanket
near
the
pass
of
la
raya
near
the
watershed
of
la
raya
we
saw
great
flocks
of
sheep
and
alpacas
numerous
corrals
and
the
huts
of
herdsmen
the
quichua
women
are
never
idle
one
often
sees
them
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
textiles
shawls
girdles
ponchos
and
blankets
on
hand
looms
fastened
to
stakes
driven
into
the
ground
when
tending
flocks
or
walking
along
the
road
they
are
always
winding
or
spinning
yarn
even
the
men
and
older
children
are
sometimes
thus
engaged
the
younger
children
used
as
shepherds
as
soon
as
they
reach
the
age
of
six
or
seven
are
rarely
expected
to
do
much
except
watch
their
charges
some
of
them
were
accompanied
by
suncca
shepherd
dogs
as
large
as
airedales
but
very
cowardly
given
to
barking
and
slinking
away
it
is
claimed
that
the
sunccas
as
well
as
two
other
varieties
were
domesticated
by
the
incas
none
of
them
showed
any
desire
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
checkers
my
faithful
airedale
their
masters
however
were
always
interested
to
see
that
checkers
could
understand
english
they
had
never
seen
a
dog
that
could
understand
anything
but
quichua
on
the
hillside
near
la

cook
gilbert
and
i
visited
a
healthy
potato
field
at
an
elevation
of
feet
a
record
altitude
for
potatoes
when
commencing
to
plough
or
spade
a
potato
field
on
the
high
slopes
near
here
it
is
the
custom
of
the
indians
to
mark
it
off
into
squares
by
furrows
about
fifteen
feet
apart
the
quichuas
commence
their
task
soon
after
daybreak
due
to
the
absence
of
artificial
lighting
and
the
discomfort
of
rising
in
the
bitter
cold
before
dawn
their
wives
do
not
prepare
breakfast
before
ten
at
which
time
it
is
either
brought
from
home
in
covered
earthenware
vessels
or
cooked
in
the
open
fields
near
where
the
men
are
working
we
came
across
one
energetic
landowner
supervising
a
score
or
more
of
indians
who
were
engaged
in
ploughing
a
potato
field
although
he
was
dressed
in
european
garb
and
was
evidently
a
man
of
means
and
intelligence
and
near
the
railroad
there
were
no
modern
implements
in
sight
we
found
that
it
is
difficult
to
get
indians
to
use
any
except
the
implements
of
their
ancestors
the
process
of
ploughing
this
field
was
undoubtedly
one
that
had
been
used
for
centuries
probably
long
before
the
spanish
conquest
the
men
working
in
unison
and
in
a
long
row
each
armed
with
a
primitive
spade
or
foot
plough
to
the
handle
of
which
footholds
were
lashed
would
at
a
signal
leap
forward
with
a
shout
and
plunge
their
spades
into
the
turf
facing
each
pair
of
men
was
a
girl
or
woman
whose
duty
it
was
to
turn
the
clods
over
by
hand
the
men
had
taken
off
their
ponchos
so
as
to
secure
greater
freedom
of
action
but
the
women
were
fully
clothed
as
usual
modesty
seeming
to
require
them
even
to
keep
heavy
shawls
over
their
shoulders
although
the
work
was
hard
and
painful
the
toil
was
lightened
by
the
joyous
contact
of
community
activity
every
one
worked
with
a
will
there
appeared
to
be
a
keen
desire
among
the
workers
to
keep
up
with
the
procession
those
who
fell
behind
were
subjected
to
teasing
community
work
is
sometimes
pleasant
even
though
it
appears
to
require
a
strong
directing
hand
the
boss
was
right
there
such
practices
would
never
suit
those
who
love
independence
in
the
centuries
of
inca
domination
there
was
little
opportunity
for
individual
effort
private
property
was
not
understood
everything
belonged
to
the
government
the
crops
were
taken
by
the
priests
the
incas
and
the
nobles
the
people
were
not
as
unhappy
as
we
should
be
one
seldom
had
to
labor
alone
everything
was
done
in
common
when
it
was
time
to
cultivate
the
fields
or
to
harvest
the
crops
the
laborers
were
ordered
by
the
incas
to
go
forth
in
huge
family
parties
they
lessened
the
hardships
of
farm
labor
by
village
gossip
and
choral
singing
interspersed
at
regular
intervals
with
rest
periods
in
which
quantities
of
chicha
quenched
the
thirst
and
cheered
the
mind
habits
of
community
work
are
still
shown
in
the
andes
one
often
sees
a
score
or
more
of
indians
carrying
huge
bundles
of
sheaves
of
wheat
or
barley
i
have
found
a
dozen
yoke
of
oxen
each
a
few
yards
from
the
other
in
a
parallel
line
engaged
in
ploughing
synchronously
small
portions
of
a
large
field
although
the
landlords
frequently
visit
lima
and
sometimes
go
to
paris
and
new
york
where
they
purchase
for
their
own
use
the
products
of
modern
invention
the
fields
are
still
cultivated
in
the
fashion
introduced
three
centuries
ago
by
the
conquistadores
who
brought
the
first
draft
animals
and
the
primitive
pointed
plough
of
the
ancient
mediterranean
crops
at
la
raya
are
not
confined
to
potatoes
another
food
plant
almost
unknown
to
europeans
even
those
who
live
in
lima
is
cañihua
a
kind
of
pigweed
it
was
being
harvested
at
the
time
of
our
visit
in
april
the
threshing
floor
for
cañihua
is
a
large
blanket
laid
on
the
ground
on
top
of
this
the
stalks
are
placed
and
the
flail
applied
the
blanket
serving
to
prevent
the
small
grayish
seeds
from
escaping
the
entire
process
uses
nothing
of
european
origin
and
has
probably
not
changed
for
centuries
we
noticed
also
quinoa
and
even
barley
growing
at
an
elevation
of
feet
quinoa
is
another
species
of
pigweed
it
often
attains
a
height
of
three
to
four
feet
there
are
several
varieties
the
variety
after
being
boiled
may
be
fairly
compared
with
oatmeal
cook
actually
preferred
it
to
the
scotch
article
both
for
taste
and
texture
the
seeds
retain
their
form
after
being
cooked
and
do
not
appear
so
slimy
as
oatmeal
other
varieties
of
quinoa
are
bitter
and
have
to
be
boiled
several
times
the
water
being
frequently
changed
the
growing
quinoa
presents
an
attractive
appearance
its
leaves
assume
many
colors
as
we
went
down
the
valley
the
evidences
of
extensive
cultivation
both
ancient
and
modern
steadily
increased
great
numbers
of
old
terraces
were
to
be
seen
there
were
many
fields
of
wheat
some
of
them
growing
high
up
on
the
mountain
side
in
what
are
called
temporales
where
owing
to
the
steep
slope
there
is
little
effort
at
tillage
or
cultivation
the
planter
trusting
to
luck
to
get
some
kind
of
a
crop
in
reward
for
very
little
effort
on
april
just
above
sicuani
we
saw
fields
where
habas
beans
had
been
gathered
and
the
dried
stalks
piled
in
little
stacks
at
occobamba
or
the
pampa
where
oca
grows
we
found
fields
of
that
useful
tuber
just
now
ripening
near
by
were
little
thatched
shelters
erected
for
the
temporary
use
of
night
watchmen
during
the
harvest
season
the
peruvian
highlanders
whom
we
met
by
the
roadside
were
different
in
feature
attitude
and
clothing
from
those
of
the
titicaca
basin
or
even
of
santa
rosa
which
is
not
far
away
they
were
typical
quichuas
peaceful
agriculturists
usually
spinning
wool
on
the
little
hand
spindles
which
have
been
used
in
the
andes
from
time
immemorial
their
huts
are
built
of
adobe
the
roofs
thatched
with
coarse
grass
the
quichuas
are
brown
in
color
their
hair
is
straight
and
black
gray
hair
is
seldom
seen
it
is
the
custom
among
the
men
in
certain
localities
to
wear
their
hair
long
and
braided
beards
are
sparse
or
lacking
bald
heads
are
very
rare
teeth
seem
to
be
more
enduring
than
with
us
throughout
the
andes
the
frequency
of
teeth
was
everywhere
noteworthy
except
on
sugar
plantations
where
there
is
opportunity
to
indulge
freely
in
crude
brown
sugar
nibbled
from
cakes
or
mixed
with
parched
corn
and
eaten
as
a
travel
ration
the
quichua
face
is
broad
and
short
its
breadth
is
nearly
the
same
as
the
eskimo
freckles
are
not
common
and
appear
to
be
limited
to
face
and
arms
in
the
few
cases
in
which
they
were
observed
on
the
other
hand
a
large
proportion
of
the
indians
are
and
show
the
effects
of
living
in
a
country
which
is
free
from
medical
tyranny
there
is
no
compulsory
vaccination
one
hardly
ever
sees
a
fat
quichua
it
is
difficult
to
tell
whether
this
is
a
racial
characteristic
or
due
rather
to
the
lack
of
foods
in
their
diet
although
the
peruvian
highlander
has
made
the
best
use
he
could
of
the
llama
he
was
never
able
to
develop
its
slender
legs
and
weak
back
sufficiently
to
use
it
for
loads
weighing
more
than
eighty
or
a
hundred
pounds
consequently
for
the
carrying
of
really
heavy
burdens
he
had
to
depend
on
himself
as
a
result
it
is
not
surprising
to
learn
from
ferris
that
while
his
arms
are
poorly
developed
his
shoulders
are
broader
his
back
muscles
stronger
and
the
calves
of
his
legs
larger
and
more
powerful
than
those
of
almost
any
other
race
the
quichuas
are
fond
of
shaking
hands
when
a
visiting
indian
joins
a
group
he
nearly
always
goes
through
the
gentle
ceremony
with
each
person
in
turn
i
do
not
know
whether
this
was
introduced
by
the
spaniards
or
comes
down
from
prehistoric
times
in
any
event
this
handshaking
in
no
way
resembles
the
hearty
clasp
familiar
to
undergraduates
at
the
beginning
of
the
college
year
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
quichua
handshake
is
extremely
fishy
and
lacks
cordiality
in
testing
the
hand
grip
of
the
quichuas
by
a
dynamometer
our
surgeons
found
that
the
muscles
of
the
forearm
were
poorly
developed
in
the
quichua
and
the
maximum
grip
was
weak
in
both
sexes
the
average
for
the
man
being
only
about
half
of
that
found
among
american
white
adults
of
sedentary

believes
that
the
aboriginal
races
of
north
and
south
america
were
of
the
same
stock
the
wide
differences
in
physiognomy
observable
among
the
different
tribes
in
north
and
south
america
are
perhaps
due
to
their
environmental
history
during
the
past
or
years
frank
chapman
of
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
has
pointed
out
the
interesting
biological
fact
that
animals
and
birds
found
at
sea
level
in
the
cold
regions
of
tierra
del
fuego
while
not
found
at
sea
level
in
peru
do
exist
at
very
high
altitudes
where
the
climate
is
similar
to
that
with
which
they
are
acquainted
similarly
it
is
interesting
to
learn
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
cold
lofty
regions
of
southern
peru
living
in
towns
and
villages
at
altitudes
of
from
to
feet
above

labrador
ferris
says
the
labrador
eskimo
and
the
quichua
constitute
the
two
races
on
the
american
continent
so
far
as
we
could
learn
by
questions
and
observation
about
one
quarter
of
the
quichuas
are
childless
in
families
which
have
children
the
average
number
is
three
or
four
large
families
are
not
common
although
we
generally
learned
that
the
living
children
in
a
family
usually
represented
less
than
half
of
those
which
had
been
born
infant
mortality
is
very
great
the
proper
feeding
of
children
is
not
understood
and
it
is
a
marvel
how
any
of
them
manage
to
grow
up
at
all
coughs
and
bronchial
trouble
are
very
common
among
the
indians
in
fact
the
most
common
afflictions
of
the
tableland
are
those
of
the
throat
and
lungs
pneumonia
is
the
most
serious
and
most
to
be
dreaded
of
all
local
diseases
it
is
really
terrifying
due
to
the
rarity
of
the
air
and
relative
scarcity
of
oxygen
pneumonia
is
usually
fatal
at
feet
and
is
uniformly
so
at
feet
patients
are
frequently
ill
only
hours
tuberculosis
is
fairly
common
its
prevalence
undoubtedly
caused
by
the
living
conditions
practiced
among
the
highlanders
who
are
unwilling
to
sleep
in
a
room
which
is
not
tightly
closed
and
protected
against
any
possible
intrusion
of
fresh
air
in
the
warmer
valleys
where
bodily
comfort
has
led
the
natives
to
use
huts
of
thatch
and
open
reeds
instead
of
the
hovels
of
the
cold
bleak
plateau
tuberculosis
is
seldom
seen
of
course
there
are
no
boards
of
health
nor
are
the
people
bothered
by
being
obliged
to
conform
to
any
sanitary
regulations
water
supplies
are
so
often
contaminated
that
the
people
have
learned
to
avoid
drinking
it
as
far
as
possible
instead
they
eat
quantities
of
soup

the
largest

in

and
the
between

and

maize
fields
we
attended
the
famous
sunday
market
many
native
druggists
were
present
their
stock
usually
consisted
of
medicines
whose
efficacy
was
learned
by
the
incas
there
were
forty
or
fifty
kinds
of
simples
and
curiosities
and
specifics
fully
half
were
reported
to
me
as
being
useful
against
fresh
air
or
the
evil
effects
of
drafts
the
medicines
included
such
minerals
as
iron
ore
and
sulphur
such
vegetables
as
dried
seeds
roots
and
the
leaves
of
plants
domesticated
hundreds
of
years
ago
by
the
incas
or
gathered
in
the
tropical
jungles
of
the
lower
urubamba
valley
and
such
animals
as
starfish
brought
from
the
pacific
ocean
some
of
them
were
really
useful
herbs
while
others
have
only
a
psychopathic
effect
on
the
patient
each
medicine
was
in
an
attractive
little
particolored
woolen
bag
the
bags
differing
in
design
and
color
woven
on
miniature

were
arranged

sicuani
at
a
place
called
racche
are
the
remarkable
ruins
of
the
temple
of
viracocha
described
by
squier
at
first
sight
racche
looks
as
though
there
were
here
a
row
of
nine
or
ten
lofty
adobe
piers
forty
or
fifty
feet
high
closer
inspection
however
shows
them
all
to
be
parts
of
the
central
wall
of
a
great
temple
the
wall
is
pierced
with
large
doors
and
the
spaces
between
the
doors
are
broken
by
niches
narrower
at
the
top
than
at
the
bottom
there
are
small
holes
in
the
doorposts
for
the
base
of
the
great
wall
is
about
five
feet
thick
and
is
of
stone
the
ashlars
are
beautifully
cut
and
while
not
rectangular
are
roughly
squared
and
fitted
together
with
most
exquisite
care
so
as
to
insure
their
making
a
very
firm
foundation
their
surface
is
most
attractive
but
strange
to
say
there
is
unmistakable
evidence
that
the
builders
did
not
wish
the
stonework
to
show
this
surface
was
at
one
time
plastered
with
clay
a
very
significant
fact
the
builders
wanted
the
wall
to
seem
to
be
built
entirely
of
adobe
yet
had
the
great
clay
wall
rested
on
the
ground
floods
and
erosion
might
have
succeeded
in
undermining
it
instead
it
rests
securely
on
a
beautifully
built
foundation
of
solid
masonry
even
so
the
great
wall
does
not
stand
absolutely
true
but
leans
slightly
to
the
westward
the
wall
also
seems
to
be
less
weathered
on
the
west
side
probably
the
prevailing
or
strongest
wind
is
from
the
east
an
interesting
feature
of
the
ruins
is
a
round
column
about
twenty
feet
high
a
very
rare
occurrence
in
inca
architecture
it
also
is
of
adobe
on
a
stone
foundation
there
is
only
one
column
now
standing
in
squier
day
the
remains
of
others
were
to
be
seen
but
i
could
find
no
evidences
of
them
there
was
probably
a
double
row
of
these
columns
to
support
the
stringers
and
tiebeams
of
the
roof
apparently
one
end
of
a
tiebeam
rested
on
the
circular
column
and
the
other
end
was
embedded
in
the
main
wall
the
holes
where
the
tiebeams
entered
the
wall
have
stone
lintels
near
the
ruins
of
the
great
temple
are
those
of
other
buildings
also
unique
so
far
as
i
know
the
base
of
the
party
wall
decorated
with
large
niches
is
of
cut
ashlars
carefully
laid
the
middle
course
is
of
adobe
while
the
upper
third
is
of
rough
uncut
stones
it
looks
very
odd
now
but
was
originally
covered
with
fine
clay
or
stucco
in
several
cases
the
plastered
walls
are
still
standing
in
fairly
good
condition
particularly
where
they
have
been
sheltered
from
the
weather
the
chief
marvel
of
racche
however
is
the
great
adobe
wall
of
the
temple
which
is
nearly
fifty
feet
high
it
is
slowly
disintegrating
as
might
be
expected
the
wonder
is
that
it
should
have
stood
so
long
in
a
rainy
region
without
any
roof
or
protecting
cover
it
is
incredible
that
for
at
least
five
hundred
years
a
wall
of
clay
should
have
been
able
to
defy
severe
rainstorms
the
lintels
made
of
timbers
and
partially
embedded
in
the
wall
are
all
gone
yet
the
adobe
remains
it
would
be
very
interesting
to
find
out
whether
the
water
of
the
springs
near
the
temple
contains
lime
if
so
this
might
have
furnished
natural
calcareous
cement
in
sufficient
quantity
to
give
the
clay
a
particularly
tenacious
quality
able
to
resist
weathering
the
factors
which
have
caused
this
extraordinary
adobe
wall
to
withstand
the
weather
in
such
an
exposed
position
for
so
many
centuries
notwithstanding
the
heavy
rains
of
each
summer
season
from
december
to
march
are
worthy
of
further
study
it
has
been
claimed
that
this
temple
was
devoted
to
the
worship
of
viracocha
a
great
deity
the
jove
or
zeus
of
the
ancient
pantheon
it
seems
to
me
more
reasonable
to
suppose
that
a
primitive
folk
constructed
here
a
temple
to
the
presiding
divinity
of
the
place
the
god
who
gave
them
this
precious
clay
the
principal
industry
of
the
neighboring
village
is
still
the
manufacture
of
pottery
no
better
clay
for
ceramic
purposes
has
been
found
in
the
andes
it
would
have
been
perfectly
natural
for
the
prehistoric
potters
to
have
desired
to
placate
the
presiding
divinity
not
so
much
perhaps
out
of
gratitude
for
the
clay
as
to
avert
his
displeasure
and
fend
off
bad
luck
in
baking
pottery
it
is
well
known
that
the
best
pottery
of
the
incas
was
extremely
fine
in
texture
students
of
ceramics
are
well
aware
of
the
uncertainty
of
the
results
of
baking
clay
bad
luck
seems
to
come
most
unaccountably
even
when
the
greatest
pains
are
taken
might
it
not
have
been
possible
that
the
people
who
were
most
concerned
with
creating
pottery
decided
to
erect
this
temple
to
insure
success
and
get
as
much
good
luck
as
possible
near
the
ancient
temple
is
a
small
modern
church
with
two
towers
the
churchyard
appears
to
be
a
favorite
place
for
baking
pottery
possibly
the
modern
potters
use
the
church
to
pray
for
success
in
their
baking
just
as
the
ancient
potters
used
the
great
temple
of
viracocha
the
walls
of
the
church
are
composed
partly
of
adobe
and
partly
of
cut
stones
taken
from
the
ruins
not
far
away
is
a
fairly
recent
though
prehistoric
lava
flow
it
occurs
to
me
that
possibly
this
flow
destroyed
some
of
the
clay
beds
from
which
the
ancient
potters
got
their
precious
material
the
temple
may
have
been
erected
as
a
propitiatory
offering
to
the
god
of
volcanoes
in
the
hope
that
the
anger
which
had
caused
him
to
send
the
lava
flow
might
be
appeased
it
may
be
that
the
inca
viracocha
an
unusually
gifted
ruler
was
particularly
interested
in
ceramics
and
was
responsible
for
building
the
temple
if
so
it
would
be
natural
for
people
who
are
devoted
to
ancestor
worship
to
have
here
worshiped
his
memory

the

the
valley
of
the
huatanay
is
one
of
many
valleys
tributary
to
the
urubamba
it
differs
from
them
in
having
more
arable
land
located
under
climatic
conditions
favorable
for
the
raising
of
the
food
crops
of
the
ancient
peruvians
containing
an
area
estimated
at
less
than
square

it

that
south

has
ever

the

sometimes
meanders
through

at

to

in

the

this

by
the
spanish

to
soldiers

mules
are
essentially
the
most
reliable
saddle
animals

these
landholders
usually
prefer
horses
which
are
larger

the

and

each
basin
contains
interesting
ruins
in
the
lucre

the
most
interesting
are
those
of
rumiccolca
and
piquillacta
at
the
extreme
eastern
end
of
the
valley
on
top
of
the
pass
which
leads
to
the
vilcanota
is
an
ancient
gateway
called
rumiccolca
rumi
stone
ccolca
granary
it
is
commonly
supposed
that
this
was
an
inca
fortress
intended
to
separate
the
chiefs
of
cuzco
from
those
of
vilcanota
it
is
now
locally
referred
to
as
a
fortaleza
the
major
part
of
the
wall
is
well
built
of
rough
stones
laid
in
clay
while
the
sides
of
the
gateway
are
faced
with
carefully
cut
andesite
ashlars
of
an
entirely
different
style
it
is
conceivable
that
some
great
chieftain
built
the
rough
wall
in
the
days
when
the
highlands
were
split
up
among
many
little
independent
rulers
and
that
later
one
of
the
incas
no
longer
needing
any
fortifications
between
the
huatanay
valley
and
the
vilcanota
valley
tore
down
part
of
the
wall
and
built
a
fine
gateway
the
faces
of
the
ashlars
are
nicely
finished
except
for
several
rough
bosses
or
nubbins
they
were
probably
used
by
the
ancient
masons
in
order
to
secure
a
better
hold
when
finally
adjusting
the
ashlars
with
small
crowbars
it
may
have
been
the
intention
of
the
stone
masons
to
remove
these
nubbins
after
the
wall
was
completed
in
one
of
the
unfinished
structures
at
machu
picchu
i
noticed
similar
bosses
the
name
was
probably
originally
applied
to
a
neighboring
edifice
now
in
ruins
on
the
rocky
hillside
above
rumiccolca
are
the
ruins
of
many
ancient
terraces
and
some
buildings
not
far
from
rumiccolca
on
the
slopes
of
mt
piquillacta
are
the
ruins
of
an
extensive
city
also
called
piquillacta
a
large
number
of
its
houses
have
extraordinarily
high
walls
a
high
wall
outside
the
city
and
running
north
and
south
was
obviously
built
to
protect
it
from
enemies
approaching
from
the
vilcanota
valley
in
the
other
directions
the
slopes
are
so
steep
as
to
render
a
wall
unnecessary
the
walls
are
built
of
fragments
of
lava
rock
with
which
the
slopes
of
mt
piquillacta
are
covered
cacti
and
thorny
scrub
are
growing
in
the
ruins
but
the
volcanic
soil
is
rich
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
agriculturists
who
come
here
from
neighboring
villages
to
cultivate
their
crops
the
slopes
above
the
city
are
still
extensively
cultivated
but
without
terraces
wheat
and
barley
are
the
principal
crops
as
an
illustration
of
the
difficulty
of
identifying
places
in
ancient
peru
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
gateway
now
called
rumiccolca
is
figured
in
squier
peru
as
piquillacta
on
the
other
hand
the
ruins
of
the
large
city
covering
thickly
an
area
nearly
a
square
mile
are
called
by
squier
the
great
inca
town
of
muyna
a
name
also
applied
to
the
little
lake
which
lies
in
the
bottom
of
the
lucre
basin
as
squier
came
along
the
road
from
racche
he
saw
mt
piquillacta
first
then
the
gateway
then
lake
muyna
then
the
ruins
of
the
city
in
each
case
the
name
of
the
most
conspicuous
harmless
natural
phenomenon
seems
to
have
been
applied
to
ruins
by
those
of
whom
he
inquired

who
has

is

familiar
with

region
brought
me
to
this
ancient
city
from
the
other
direction
from

i
learned
that
the
city

are
called

the

is

consequently
it
would
be
natural
for

viewing

from

to
give
to

the

of

and
what
was
its

in
the
days
of
the

was

because
it
was
considered
unlucky
whatever
the
reason
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
fact
that
we
have
here
the
evidences
of
a
very
large
town
possibly
long
since
abandoned
there
are
scores
of
houses
and
numerous
compounds
laid
out
in
regular
fashion
the
streets
crossing
each

at

angles
the
whole
covering
an
area
considerably
larger
than
the
important

of

not
a
soul
lives
here
it
is
true
that
across
the
vilcanota
to
the
east
is
a
difficult
mountainous
country
culminating
in
mt
ausangate
the
highest
peak
in

yet
piquillacta
is
in
the
midst
of
a
populous
region
to
the
north
lies
the
thickly
settled
valley
of
pisac
and
yucay
to
the
south
the
important
vilcanota
valley
with
dozens
of
villages
to
the
west
the
densely
populated
valley
of
the
huatanay
and
cuzco
itself
the
largest
city
in
the
highlands
of
peru
thousands
of
people
live
within
a
radius
of
twenty
miles
of
piquillacta
and
the
population
is
on
the
increase
it
is
perfectly
easy
of
access
and
is
less
than
a
mile
east
of
the
railroad
yet
it
is
abandonado
desierto
despoblado
undoubtedly
here
was
once
a
large
city
of
great
importance
the
reason
for
its
being
abandoned
appears
to
be
the
absence
of
running
water
although
mt
piquillacta
is
a
large
mass
nearly
five
miles
long
and
two
miles
wide
rising
to
a
point
of
feet
above
the
huatanay
and
vilcanota
rivers
it
has
no
streams
brooks
or
springs
it
is
an
isolated
extinct
volcano
surrounded
by
igneous
rocks
lavas
andesites
and
basalts
how
came
it
that
so
large
a
city
as
piquillacta
could
have
been
built
on
the
slopes
of
a
mountain
which
has
no
running
streams
has
the
climate
changed
so
much
since
those
days
if
so
how
is
it
that
the
surrounding
region
is
still
the
populous
part
of
southern
peru
it
is
inconceivable
that
so
large
a
city
could
have
been
built
and
occupied
on
a
plateau
four
hundred
feet
above
the
nearest
water
unless
there
was
some
way
of
providing
it
other
than
the
arduous
one
of
bringing
every
drop
up
the
hill
on
the
backs
of
men
and
llamas
if
there
were
no
places
near
here
better
provided
with
water
than
this
site
one
could
understand
that
perhaps
its
inhabitants
were
obliged
to
depend
entirely
upon
water
carriers
on
the
contrary
within
a
radius
of
six
miles
there
are
half
a
dozen
unoccupied
sites
near
running
streams
until
further
studies
can
be
made
of
this
puzzling
problem
i
believe
that
the
answer
lies
in
the
ruins
of
rumiccolca
which
are
usually
thought
of
as
a
fortress
squier
says
that
this
fortress
was
the
southern
limit
of
the
dominions
of
the
first
inca
the
fortress
reaches
from
the
mountain
on
one
side
to
a
high
rocky
eminence
on
the
other
it
is
popularly
called
aqueducto
perhaps
from
some
fancied
resemblance
to
an
aqueduct
but
the
name
is
evidently
misapplied
yet
he
admits
that
the
of
the
wall
diminishing
as
it
does
by
graduations
or
steps
on
both
sides
might
appear
to
conflict
with
the
hypothesis
of
its
being
a
work
of
defense
or
fortification
if
it
occupied
a
different
position
he
noticed
that
the
top
of
the
wall
is
throughout
of
the
same
level
becomes
less
in
height
as
it
approaches
the
hills
on
either
hand
and
diminishes
proportionately
in
thickness
as
an
aqueduct
should
do
yet
so
possessed
was
he
by
the
fortress
idea
that
he
rejected
not
only
local
tradition
as
expressed
in
the
native
name
but
even
turned
his
back
on
the
evidence
of
his
own
eyes
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
little
doubt
that
instead
of
the
ruins
of
rumiccolca
representing
a
fortification
we
have
here
the
remains
of
an
ancient
azequia
or
aqueduct
built
by
some
powerful
chieftain
to
supply
the
people
of
piquillacta
with
water
a
study
of
the
topography
of
the
region
shows
that
the
river
which
rises
southwest
of
the
village
of
lucre
and
furnishes
water
power
for
its
modern
textile
mills
could
have
been
used
to
supply
such
an
azequia
the
water
collected
at
an
elevation
of
feet
could
easily
have
been
brought
six
miles
along
the
southern
slopes
of
the
lucre
basin
around
mt
rumiccolca
and
across
the
old
road
on
this
aqueduct
at
an
elevation
of
about
feet
this
would
have
permitted
it
to
flow
through
some
of
the
streets
of
piquillacta
and
give
the
ancient
city
an
adequate
supply
of
water
the
slopes
of
rumiccolca
are
marked
by
many
ancient
terraces
their
upper
limit
corresponds
roughly
with
the
contour
along
which
such
an
azequia
would
have
had
to
pass
there
is
in
fact
a
distinct
line
on
the
hillside
which
looks
as
though
an
azequia
had
once
passed
that
way
in
the
valley
back
of
lucre
are
also
faint
indications
of
old
azequias
there
has
been
however
a
considerable
amount
of
erosion
on
the
hills
and
if
as
seems
likely
the
have
been
out
of
order
for
several
centuries
it
is
not
surprising
that
all
traces
of
them
have
disappeared
in
places
i
regret
very
much
that
circumstances
over
which
i
had
no
control
prevented
my
making
a
thorough
study
of
the
possibilities
of
such
a
theory
it
remains
for
some
fortunate
future
investigator
to
determine
who
were
the
inhabitants
of
piquillacta
how
they
secured
their
water
supply
and
why
the
city
was
abandoned
figure

figure
ruins
of

until
then
i
suggest
as
a
possible
working
hypothesis
that
we
have
at
piquillacta
the
remains
of
a
city
that
its
chiefs
and
people
cultivated
the
lucre
basin
and
its
tributaries
that
as
a
community
they
were
a
separate
political
entity
from
the
people
of
cuzco
that
the
ruler
of
the
cuzco
people
perhaps
an
inca
finally
became
sufficiently
powerful
to
conquer
the
people
of
the
lucre
basin
and
removed
the
tribes
which
had
occupied
piquillacta
to
a
distant
part
of
his
domain
a
system
of
colonization
well
known
in
the
history
of
the
incas
that
after
the
people
who
had
built
and
lived
in
piquillacta
departed
no
subsequent
dwellers
in
this
region
cared
to
reoccupy
the
site
and
its
aqueduct
fell
into
decay
it
is
easy
to
believe
that
at
first
such
a
site
would
have
been
considered
unlucky
its
houses
unfamiliar
and
unfashionable
in
design
would
have
been
considered
not
desirable
their
high
walls
might
have
been
used
for
a
reconstructed
city
had
there
been
plenty
of
water
available
in
any
case
the
ruins
of
the
lucre
basin
offer
a
most
fascinating
problem
in
the
oropesa
basin
the
most
important
ruins
are
those
of
tipon
a
pleasant
valley
several
hundred
feet
above
the
village
of
quispicanchi
they
include
carefully
constructed
houses
of
characteristic
inca
construction
containing
many
symmetrically
arranged
niches
with
stone
lintels
the
walls
of
most
of
the
houses
are
of
rough
stones
laid
in
clay
tipon
was
probably
the
residence
of
the
principal
chief
of
the
oropesa
basin
it
commands
a
pleasant
view
of
the
village
and
of
the
hills
to
the
south
which
are
covered
with
fields
of
wheat
and
barley
at
tipon
there
is
a
nicely
constructed
fountain
of
cut
stone
some
of
the
terraces
are
extremely
well
built
with
roughly
squared
blocks
fitting
tightly
together
access
from
one
terrace
to
another
was
obtained
by
steps
made
each
of
a
single
bonder
projecting
from
the
face
of
the
terrace
few
better
constructed
terrace
walls
are
to
be
seen
anywhere
the
terraces
are
still
cultivated
by
the
people
of
quispicanchi
no
one
lives
at
tipon
now
although
little
shepherd
boys
and
goatherds
frequent
the
neighborhood
it
is
more
convenient
for
the
agriculturists
to
live
at
the
edge
of
their
largest
fields
which
are
in
the
valley
bottom
than
to
climb
five
hundred
feet
into
the
narrow
valley
and
occupy
the
old
buildings
motives
of
security
no
longer
require
a
residence
here
rather
than
in
the
open
plain
while
i
was
examining
the
ruins
and
digging
up
a
few
attractive
potsherds
bearing
inca
designs
giesecke
the
president
of
the
university
of
cuzco
who
had
accompanied
me
climbed
the
mountain
above
tipon
with
aguilar
and
reported
the
presence
of
a
fortification
near
its
summit
my
stay
at
oropesa
was
rendered
most
comfortable
and
happy
by
the
generous
hospitality
of
aguilar
whose
finca
is
between
quispicanchi
and
oropesa
and
commands
a
charming
view
of
the
valley
from
the
oropesa
basin
one
enters
the
cuzco
basin
through
an
opening
in
the
sandstone
cliffs
of
angostura
near
the
modern
town
of
san
geronimo
on
the
slopes
above
the
south
bank
of
the
huatanay
just
beyond
angostura
are
the
ruins
of
a
score
or
more
of
houses
of
characteristic
inca
construction
the
ancient
buildings
have
doors
windows
and
niches
in
walls
of
small
stones
laid
in
clay
the
lintels
having
been
of
wood
now
decayed
when
we
asked
the
name
of
these
ruins
we
were
told
that
it
was
saylla
although
that
is
the
name
of
a
modern
village
three
miles
away
down
the
huatanay
in
the
oropesa
basin
like
piquillacta
old
saylla
has
no
water
supply
at
present
it
is
not
far
from
a
stream
called
the
kkaira
and
could
easily
have
been
supplied
with
water
by
an
azequia
less
than
two
miles
in
length
brought
along
the
feet
contour
it
looks
very
much
like
the
case
of
a
village
originally
placed
on
the
hills
for
the
sake
of
comparative
security
and
isolation
and
later
abandoned
through
a
desire
to
enjoy
the
advantages
of
living
near
the
great
highway
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
after
the
incas
had
established
peace
over
the
highlands
there
may
be
another
explanation
it
appears
from
cook
studies
that
the
deforestation
of
the
cuzco
basin
by
the
hand
of
man
and
modern
methods
of
tillage
on
unterraced
slopes
have
caused
an
unusual
amount
of
erosion
to
occur
landslides
are
frequent
in
the
rainy
season
opposite
saylla
is
mt
picol
whose
twin
peaks
are
the
most
conspicuous
feature
on
the
north
side
of
the
basin
waste
material
from
its
slopes
is
causing
the
rapid
growth
of
a
great
gravel
fan
north
of
the
village
of
san
geronimo
professor
gregory
noticed
that
the
streams
traversing
the
fan
are
even
now
engaged
in
burying
ancient
fields
by
transporting
gravel
from
the
head
of
the
fan
to
its
lower
margin
and
that
the
lower
end
of
the
cuzco
basin
where
the
huatanay
hemmed
in
between
the
angostura
narrows
can
not
carry
away
the
sediment
as
fast
as
it
is
brought
down
by
its
tributaries
is
being
choked
up
if
old
saylla
represents
a
fortress
set
here
to
defend
cuzco
against
old
oropesa
it
might
very
naturally
have
been
abandoned
when
the
rule
of
the
incas
finally
spread
far
over
the
andes
on
the
other
hand
it
seems
more
likely
that
the
people
who
built
saylla
were
farmers
and
that
when
the
lower
cuzco
basin
was
filled
up
by
aggradation
due
to
increased
erosion
they
abandoned
this
site
for
one
nearer
the
arable
lands
one
may
imagine
the
dismay
with
which
the
agricultural
residents
of
these
ancient
houses
saw
their
beautiful
fields
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
covered
in
a
few
days
or
even
hours
by
enormous
quantities
of
coarse
gravel
brought
down
from
the
steep
slopes
of
picol
after
some
driving
rainstorm
it
may
have
been
some
such
catastrophe
that
led
them
to
take
up
their
residence
elsewhere
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
do
not
know
when
it
was
abandoned
further
investigation
might
point
to
its
having
been
deserted
when
the
spanish
village
of
san
geronimo
was
founded
however
i
believe
students
of
agriculture
will
agree
with
me
that
deforestation
increased
erosion
and
aggrading
gravel
banks
probably
drove
the
folk
out
of
saylla
the
southern
rim
of
the
cuzco
basin
is
broken
by
no
very
striking
peaks
although
huanacaurai
the
highest
point
is
connected
in
inca
tradition
with
some
of
the
principal
festivals
and
religious
celebrations
the
north
side
of
the
huatanay
valley
is
much
more
irregular
ranging
from
ttica
ttica
pass
to
mt
pachatucsa
whose
five
little
peaks
are
frequently
there
is
no
permanent
snow
either
here
or
elsewhere
in
the
huatanay
valley
the
people
of
the
cuzco
basin
are
very
short
of
fuel
there
is
no
native
coal
what
the
railroad
uses
comes
from
australia
firewood
is
scarce
the
ancient
forests
disappeared
long
ago
the
only
trees
in
sight
are
a
few
willows
or
poplars
from
europe
and
one
or
two
groves
of
eucalyptus
also
from
australia
cuzco
has
been
thought
of
and
written
of
as
being
above
the
tree
line
but
such
is
not
the
case
the
absence
of
trees
on
the
neighboring
hills
is
due
entirely
to
the
hand
of
man
the
long
occupation
the
necessities
of
early
agriculturists
who
cleared
the
forests
before
the
days
of
intensive
terrace
agriculture
and
the
firewood
requirements
of
a
large
population
the
people
of
cuzco
do
not
dream
of
having
enough
fuel
to
make
their
houses
warm
and
comfortable
only
with
difficulty
can
they
get
enough
for
cooking
purposes
they
depend
largely
on
fagots
and
straw
which
are
brought
into
town
on
the
backs
of
men
and
animals
in
the
fields
of
stubble
left
from
the
wheat
and
barley
harvest
we
saw
many
sheep
feeding
they
were
thin
and
and
many
of
the
rams
had
four
horns
apparently
due
to
centuries
of
inbreeding
and
the
failure
to
improve
the
original
stock
by
the
introduction
of
new
and
superior
strains
when
one
looks
at
the
great
amount
of
arable
slopes
on
most
of
the
hills
of
the
cuzco
basin
and
the
unusually
extensive
flat
land
near
the
huatanay
one
readily
understands
why
the
heart
of
inca
land
witnessed
a
concentration
of
population
very
unusual
in
the
andes
most
of
the
important
ruins
are
in
the
northwest
quadrant
of
the
basin
either
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
cuzco
itself
or
on
the
pampas
north
of
the
city
the
reason
is
that
the
arable
lands
where
most
extensive
potato
cultivation
could
be
carried
out
are
nearly
all
in
this
quadrant
in
the
midst
of
this
potato
country
at
the
foot
of
the
pass
that
leads
directly
to
pisac
and
paucartambo
is
a
picturesque
ruin
which
bears
the
native
name
of
pucará
pucará
is
the
quichua
word
for
fortress
and
it
needs
but
one
glance
at
the
little
hilltop
crowned
with
a
rectangular
fortification
to
realize
that
the
term
is
justified
the
walls
are
beautifully
made
of
irregular
blocks
closely
fitted
together
advantage
was
taken
of
small
cliffs
on
two
sides
of
the
hill
to
strengthen
the
fortifications
we
noticed
openings
or
drains
which
had
been
cut
in
the
wall
by
the
original
builders
in
order
to
prevent
the
accumulation
of
moisture
on
the
terraced
floor
of
the
enclosed
area
which
is
several
feet
above
that
of
the
sloping
field
outside
similar
conduits
may
be
seen
in
many
of
the
old
walls
in
the
city
of
cuzco
apparently
the
ancient
folk
fully
appreciated
the
importance
of
good
drainage
and
took
pains
to
secure
it
at
present
pucará
is
occupied
by
llama
herdsmen
and
drovers
who
find
the
enclosure
a
very
convenient
corral
probably
pucará
was
built
by
the
chief
of
a
tribe
of
prehistoric
herdsmen

one
may
fairly

is
possible
that
this
is
the
place
where
according
to
molina
all
the
youths
of
cuzco
who
had
been
armed
as
knights
in
the
great
november
festival
came
on
the
day
of

to
bathe

afterwards
they
returned
to
the

to
be
lectured
by

flogged

never

tampu

near

are

called

the
presence
of
salt
in
many
of
the
springs
of
the
huatanay
valley
was
a
great
source
of
annoyance
to
our
topographic
engineers
who
were
frequently
obliged
to
camp
in
districts
where
the
only
water
available
was
so
saline
as
to
spoil
it
for
drinking
purposes
and
ruin
the
tea
the
cuzco
basin
was
undoubtedly
once
the
site
of
a
lake
an
ancient
whose
surface
says
professor
gregory
lay
well
above
the
present
site
of
san
sebastian
and
san
geronimo
this
lake
is
believed
to
have
reached
its
maximum
expansion
in
early
pleistocene
times
its
rich
silts
so
well
adapted
for
raising
maize
habas
beans
and
quinoa
have
always
attracted
farmers
and
are
still
intensively
cultivated
it
has
been
named
lake
morkill
in
honor
of
that
loyal
friend
of
scientific
research
in
peru
william
morkill
without
whose
untiring
aid
we
could
never
have
brought
our
peruvian
explorations
as
far
along
as
we
did
in
times
lake
morkill
fluctuated
in
volume
from
time
to
time
parts
of
the
shore
were
exposed
long
enough
to
enable
plants
to
send
their
roots
into
the
fine
materials
and
the
sun
to
bake
and
crack
the
muds
mastodons
grazed
on
its
banks
lake
morkill
probably
existed
during
all
or
nearly
all
of
the
glacial
epoch
its
drainage
was
finally
accomplished
by
the
huatanay
cutting
down
the
sandstone
hills
near
saylla
and
developing
the
angostura
gorge
in
the
banks
of
the
huatanay
a
short
distance
below
the
city
of
cuzco
the
stratified
beds
of
the
vanished
lake
morkill
contain
many
fossil
shells
above
these
are
gravels
brought
down
by
the
floods
and
landslides
of
more
modern
times
in
which
may
be
found
potsherds
and
bones
one
of
the
chief
affluents
of
the
huatanay
is
the
chunchullumayo
which
cuts
off
the
southernmost
third
of
cuzco
from
the
center
of
the
city
its
banks
are
terraced
and
are
still
used
for
gardens
and
food
crops
here
the
hospitable
canadian
missionaries
have
their
pleasant
station
a
veritable
oasis
of
cleanliness
on
a
july
morning
in
while
strolling
up
the
ayahuaycco
quebrada
an
affluent
of
the
chunchullumayo
in
company
with
professor
foote
and
surgeon
erving
my
interest
was
aroused
by
the
sight
of
several
bones
and
potsherds
exposed
by
recent
erosion
in
the
stratified
gravel
banks
of
the
little
gulch
further
examination
showed
that
recent
erosion
had
also
cut
through
an
ancient
ash
heap
on
the
side
toward
cuzco
i
discovered
a
section
of
stone
wall
built
of
roughly
finished
stones
more
or
less
carefully
fitted
together
which
at
first
sight
appeared
to
have
been
built
to
prevent
further
washing
away
of
that
side
of
the
gulch
yet
above
the
wall
and
flush
with
its
surface
the
bank
appeared
to
consist
of
stratified
gravel
indicating
that
the
wall
antedated
the
gravel
deposits
fifty
feet
farther
up
the
quebrada
another
portion
of
wall
appeared
under
the
gravel
bank
on
top
of
the
bank
was
a
cultivated
field
half
an
hour
digging
in
the
compact
gravel
showed
that
there
was
more
wall
underneath
the
field
later
investigation
by
dr
bowman
showed
that
the
wall
was
about
three
feet
thick
and
nine
feet
in
height
carefully
faced
on
both
sides
with
roughly
cut
stone
and
filled
in
with
rubble
a
type
of
stonework
not
uncommon
in
the
foundations
of
some
of
the
older
buildings
in
the
western
part
of
the
city
of
cuzco
figure
huatanay
vallye
cuzco
and
the
ayahuaycco
quebrada
even
at
first
sight
it
was
obvious
that
this
wall
built
by
man
was
completely
covered
to
a
depth
of
six
or
eight
feet
by
a
compact
gravel
bank
this
was
sufficiently
difficult
to
understand
yet
a
few
days
later
while
endeavoring
to
solve
the
puzzle
i
found
something
even
more
exciting
half
a
mile
farther
up
the
gulch
the
road
newly
cut
ran
close
to
the
compact
perpendicular
gravel
bank
about
five
feet
above
the
road
i
saw
what
looked
like
one
of
the
small
rocks
which
are
freely
interspersed
throughout
the
gravels
here
closer
examination
showed
it
to
be
the
end
of
a
human
femur
apparently
it
formed
an
integral
part
of
the
gravel
bank
which
rose
almost
perpendicularly
for
seventy
or
eighty
feet
above
it
impressed
by
the
possibilities
in
case
it
should
turn
out
to
be
true
that
here
in
the
heart
of
inca
land
a
human
bone
had
been
buried
under
feet
of
gravel
i
refrained
from
disturbing
it
until
i
could
get
dr
bowman
and
professor
foote
the
geologist
and
the
naturalist
of
the
expedition
to
come
with
me
to
the
ayahuaycco
quebrada
we
excavated
the
femur
and
found
behind
it
fragments
of
a
number
of
other
bones
they
were
excessively
fragile
the
femur
was
unable
to
support
more
than
four
inches
of
its
own
weight
and
broke
off
after
the
gravel
had
been
partly
removed
although
the
gravel
itself
was
somewhat
damp
the
bones
were
dry
and
powdery
ashy
gray
in
color
the
bones
were
carried
to
the
hotel
central
where
they
were
carefully
photographed
soaked
in
melted
vaseline
packed
in
cotton
batting
and
eventually
brought
to
new
haven
here
they
were
examined
by
george
eaton
curator
of
osteology
in
the
peabody
museum
in
the
meantime
dr
bowman
had
become
convinced
that
the
compact
gravels
of
ayahuaycco
were
of
glacial
origin
when
eaton
first
examined
the
bone
fragments
he
was
surprised
to
find
among
them
the
bone
of
a
horse
unfortunately
a
careful
examination
of
the
photographs
taken
in
cuzco
of
all
the
fragments
which
were
excavated
by
us
on
july
failed
to
reveal
this
particular
bone
dr
bowman
upon
being
questioned
said
that
he
had
dug
out
one
or
two
more
bones
in
the
cliff
adjoining
our
excavation
of
july
and
had
added
these
to
the
original
lot
presumably
this
horse
bone
was
one
which
he
had
added
when
the
bones
were
packed
it
did
not
worry
him
however
and
so
sure
was
he
of
his
interpretation
of
the
gravel
beds
that
he
declared
he
did
not
care
if
we
had
found
the
bone
of
a
percheron
stallion
he
was
sure
that
the
age
of
the
vertebrate
remains
might
be
provisionally
estimated
at
to
years
until
further
studies
could
be
made
of
the
geology
of
the
surrounding
territory
in
an
article
on
the
buried
wall
dr
bowman
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
wall
is
that
its
relations
to
alluvial
deposits
which
cover
it
indicate
its
erection
before
the
alluvial
slope
in
which
it
lies
buried
was
formed
and
that
it
represents
the
earliest
type
of
architecture
at
present
known
in
the
cuzco
basin
eaton
study
of
the
bones
brought
out
the
fact
that
eight
of
them
were
fragments
of
human
bones
representing
at
least
three
individuals
four
were
fragments
of
llama
bones
one
of
the
bone
of
a
dog
and
three
were
bovine
remains
the
human
remains
agreed
in
all
essential
respects
with
the
bones
of
modern
quichuas
llama
and
dog
might
all
have
belonged
to
inca
or
even
more
recent
times
but
the
bovine
remains
presented
considerable
difficulty
the
three
fragments
were
from
bones
which
are
among
the
least
characteristic
parts
of
the
skeleton
that
which
was
of
greatest
interest
was
the
fragment
of
a
first
rib
resembling
the
first
rib
of
the
extinct
bison
since
this
fragmentary
bovine
rib
was
of
a
form
apparently
characteristic
of
bisons
and
not
seen
in
the
domestic
cattle
of
the
united
states
eaton
felt
that
it
could
not
be
denied
that
the
material
examined
suggests
the
possibility
that
some
species
of
bison
is
here
represented
yet
it
would
hardly
be
in
accordance
with
conservative
methods
to
differentiate
bison
from
domestic
cattle
solely
by
characters
obtained
from
a
study
of
the
first
ribs
of
a
small
number
of
individuals
although
staunchly
supporting
his
theory
of
the
age
of
the
vertebrate
remains
dr
bowman
in
his
report
on
their
geological
relations
admitted
that
the
weakness
of
his
case
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
bovine
remains
were
not
sharply
differentiated
from
the
bones
of
modern
cattle
and
also
in
the
possibility
that
the
bluff
in
which
the
bones
were
found
may
be
faced
by
younger
gravel
and
that
the
bones
were
found
in
a
gravel
veneer
deposited
during
later
periods
of
partial
valley
filling
although
it
still
seems
very
unlikely
reports
of
glacial
man
in
america
have
come
from
places
as
widely
separated
as
california
and
argentina
careful
investigation
however
has
always
thrown
doubt
on
any
great
age
being
certainly
attributable
to
any
human
remains
in
view
of
the
fragmentary
character
of
the
skeletal
evidence
the
fact
that
no
proof
of
great
antiquity
could
be
drawn
from
the
characters
of
the
human
skeletal
parts
and
the
suggestion
made
by
dr
bowman
of
the
possibility
that
the
gravels
which
contained
the
bones
might
be
of
a
later
origin
than
he
thought
we
determined
to
make
further
and
more
complete
investigations
in
it
was
most
desirable
to
clear
up
all
doubts
and
dissolve
all
skepticism
i
felt
perhaps
mistakenly
that
while
a
further
study
of
the
geology
of
the
cuzco
basin
undoubtedly
might
lead
dr
bowman
to
reverse
his
opinion
as
was
expected
by
some
geologists
if
it
should
lead
him
to
confirm
his
original
conclusions
the
same
skeptics
would
be
likely
to
continue
their
skepticism
and
say
he
was
trying
to
bolster
up
his
own
previous
opinions
accordingly
i
believed
it
preferable
to
take
another
geologist
whose
independent
testimony
would
give
great
weight
to
those
conclusions
should
he
find
them
confirmed
by
an
exhaustive
geological
study
of
the
huatanay
valley
i
asked
dr
bowman
colleague
professor
gregory
to
make
the
necessary
studies
at
his
request
a
very
careful
map
of
the
huatanay
valley
was
prepared
under
the
direction
of
chief
topographer
albert
bumstead
eaton
who
had
had
no
opportunity
of
seeing
peru
was
invited
to
accompany
us
and
make
a
study
of
the
bones
of
modern
peruvian
cattle
as
well
as
of
any
other
skeletal
remains
which
might
be
found
furthermore
it
seemed
important
to
me
to
dig
a
tunnel
into
the
ayahuaycco
hillside
at
the
exact
point
from
which
we
took
the
bones
in
so
i
asked
heald
whose
engineering
training
had
been
in
colorado
to
superintend
it
heald
dug
a
tunnel
eleven
feet
long
with
a
four
and
a
half
by
three
feet
into
the
solid
mass
of
gravel
he
expected
to
have
to
use
timbering
but
so
firmly
packed
was
the
gravel
that
this
was
not
necessary
no
bones
or
artifacts
were
found
nothing
but
coarse
gravel
uniform
in
texture
and
containing
no
unmistakable
evidences
of
stratification
apparently
the
bones
had
been
in
a
land
slip
on
the
edge
of
an
older
compact
gravel
mass
in
his
studies
of
the
cuzco
basin
professor
gregory
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
ayahuaycco
gravel
banks
might
have
been
repeatedly
buried
and
reëxcavated
many
times
during
the
past
few
centuries
he
found
evidence
indicating
periodic
destruction
and
rebuilding
of
some
gravel
terraces
even
within
the
past
one
hundred
years
accordingly
there
was
no
longer
any
necessity
to
ascribe
great
antiquity
to
the
bones
or
the
wall
which
we
found
in
the
ayahuaycco
quebrada
although
the
cuzco
gravels
are
believed
to
have
reached
their
greatest
extent
and
thickness
in
late
pleistocene
times
more
recent
deposits
have
however
been
superimposed
on
top
and
alongside
of
them
surface
wash
from
the
bordering
slopes
controlled
in
amount
and
character
by
climatic
changes
has
probably
been
accumulating
continuously
since
glacial
times
and
has
greatly
increased
since
human
occupation
began
geologic
data
do
not
require
more
than
a
few
hundreds
of
years
as
the
age
of
the
human
remains
found
in
the
cuzco
gravels
but
how
about
the
bison
soon
after
his
arrival
in
cuzco
eaton
examined
the
first
ribs
of
carcasses
of
beef
animals
offered
for
sale
in
the
public
markets
he
immediately
became
convinced
that
the
bison
was
a
peruvian
domestic
ox
under
the
prevailing
in
this
part
of
the
andes
and
possibly
in
correlation
with
the
increased
action
of
the
respiratory
muscles
in
a
rarefied
air
domestic
cattle
occasionally
develop
first
ribs
closely
approaching
the
form
observed
in
bison
such
was
the
sad
end
of
the
bison
and
the
cuzco
man
who
at
one
time
i
thought
might
be
forty
thousand
years
old
and
now
believe
to
have
been
two
hundred
years
old
perhaps
the
word
ayahuaycco
in
quichua
means
the
valley
of
dead
bodies
or
dead
man
gulch
there
is
a
story
that
it
was
used
as
a
burial
place
for
plague
victims
in
cuzco
not
more
than
three
generations
ago

if
the
modern
traveler
finds
fault
with
some
of
the
conditions
he
encounters
he
must
remember
that
many
of
the
achievements
of
the
people
of
ancient
cuzco
are
not
yet
duplicated
in
his
own
country
nor
have
they
ever
been
equaled
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
and
modern
cuzco
is
steadily
progressing
the
great
square
in
front
of
the
cathedral
was
completely
metamorphosed
by
prefect
nuñez
in
concrete
walks
and
beds
of
bright
flowers
have
replaced
the
market
and
the
old
cobblestone
paving
and
made
the
plaza
a
favorite
promenade
of
the
citizens
on
pleasant
evenings
the
principal
now
is
the
plaza
of
san
francisco
it
is
crowded
with
booths
of
every
description
nearly
all
of
the
and
utensils
used
by
the
indians
may
be
bought
here
frequently
thronged
with
indians
buying
and
selling
arguing
and
jabbering
it
affords
particularly
in
the
early
morning
a
source
of
entertainment
to
one
who
is
fond
of
the
picturesque
and
interested
in
strange
manners
and
customs
the
retail
merchants
of
cuzco
follow
the
very
old
custom
of
congregating
by
classes
in
one
street
are
the
dealers
in
hats
in
another
those
who
sell
coca
the
dressmakers
and
tailors
are
nearly
all
in
one
long
arcade
in
a
score
or
more
of
dark
little
shops
their
light
seems
to
come
entirely
from
the
front
door
the
occupants
are
operators
of
american
who
not
only
make
clothing
to
order
but
always
have
on
hand
a
large
assortment
of
standard
sizes
and
patterns
in
another
arcade
are
the
shops
of
those
who
specialize
in
everything
which
appeals
to
the
eye
and
the
pocketbook
of
the
arriero
richly
decorated
halters
which
are
intended
to
avert
the
evil
eye
from
his
best
mules
leather
knapsacks
in
which
to
carry
his
coca
or
other
valuable
articles
cloth
cinches
and
leather
bridles
rawhide

with
which
he
is
more
likely
to
make
a
diamond
hitch
than
to
rope
a
mule
flutes
to
while
away
the
weary
hours
of
his
journey
and
candles
to
be
burned

some
distant

the
paraphernalia
of
his

figure
map
of

and
view
of
cuzco
from
the
speculum
orbis
terrarum
antwerp
in
order
to
learn
more
about
the
picturesque
quichuas
who
throng
the
streets
of
cuzco
it
was
felt
to
be
important
to
secure
anthropometric
measurements
of
a
hundred
indians
accordingly
surgeon
nelson
set
up
a
laboratory
in
the
hotel
central
his
subjects
were
the
unwilling
victims
of
friendly
gendarmes
who
went
out
into
the
streets
with
orders
to
bring
for
examination
only
quichuas
most
of
the
indians
showed
no
resentment
and
were
in
the
end
pleased
and
surprised
to
find
themselves
the
recipients
of
a
small
silver
coin
as
compensation
for
loss
of
time
one
might
have
supposed
that
a
large
proportion
of
subjects
would
have
claimed
cuzco
as
their
native
place
but
this
was
not
the
case
actually
fewer
indians
came
from
the
city
itself
than
from
relatively
small
towns
like
anta
huaracondo
and
maras
this
may
have
been
due
to
a
number
of
causes
in
the
first
place
the
gendarmes
may
have
preferred
to
arrest
strangers
from
distant
villages
who
would
submit
more
willingly
secondly
the
city
folk
were
presumably
more
likely
to
be
in
their
shops
attending
to
their
business
or
watching
their
wares
in
the
plaza
an
occupation
which
the
gendarmes
could
not
interrupt
on
the
other
hand
it
is
also
probably
true
that
the
residents
of
cuzco
are
of
more
mixed
descent
than
those
of
remote
villages
where
even
one
can
not
find
more
than
two
or
three
individuals
who
speak
spanish
furthermore
the
attention
of
the
gendarmes
might
have
been
drawn
more
easily
to
the
quaintly
caparisoned
indians
temporarily
in
from
the
country
where
city
fashions
do
not
prevail
than
to
those
who
through
long
residence
in
the
city
had
learned
to
adopt
a
costume
more
in
accordance
with
european
notions
in
according
to
squier
seven
eighths
of
the
population
of
cuzco
were
still
pure
indian
even
a
large
proportion
of
the
individuals
whom
one
sees
in
the
streets
appears
to
be
of
pure
aboriginal
ancestry
of
these
we
found
that
many
are
visitors
from
outlying
villages
cuzco
is
the
mecca
of
the
most
densely
populated
part
of
the
andes
probably
a
large
part
of
its
citizens
are
of
mixed
spanish
and
quichua
ancestry
the
spanish
conquistadores
did
not
bring
european
women
with
them
nearly
all
took
native
wives
the
spanish
race
is
composed
of
such
an
extraordinary
mixture
of
peoples
from
europe
and
northern
africa
celts
iberians
romans
and
goths
as
well
as
carthaginians
berbers
and
moors
that
the
hispanic
peoples
have
far
less
antipathy
toward
intermarriage
with
the
american
race
than
have
the
and
teutons
of
northern
europe
consequently
there
has
gone
on
for
centuries
intermarriage
of
spaniards
and
indians
with
results
which
are
difficult
to
determine
some
writers
have
said
there
were
once
people
in
cuzco
with
primitive
methods
of
transportation
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
feed
so
many
furthermore
in
there
were
according
to
montesinos
only
indians
in
cuzco
one
of
the
charms
of
cuzco
is
the
juxtaposition
of
old
and
new
street
cars
clanging
over
steel
rails
carry
crowds
of
cuzceños
past
inca
walls
to
greet
their
friends
at
the
railroad
station
the
driver
is
scarcely
able
by
the
most
vigorous
application
of
his

to
prevent
his

from
crashing
into

supercilious

were

the
custom
is
to

intercept
one
view
of
the
beautiful
stone
facade
of
an
old
jesuit
church
now
part
of
the
university
of
cuzco
it
is
built
of
reddish
basalt
from
the
quarries
of
huaccoto
near
the
twin
peaks
of
mt
picol
professor
gregory
says
that
this
huaccoto
basalt
has
a
softness
and
uniformity
of
texture
which
renders
it
peculiarly
suitable
for
that
elaborately
carved
stonework
which
was
so
greatly
desired
by
ecclesiastical
architects
of
the
sixteenth
century
as
compared
with
the
dense
diorite
which
was
extensively
used
by
the
incas
the
basalt
weathers
far
more
rapidly
the
rich
red
color
of
the
weathered
portions
gives
to
the
jesuit
church
an
atmosphere
of
extreme
age
the
courtyard
of
the
university
whose
arcades
echoed
to
the
feet
of
learned
jesuit
teachers
long
before
yale
was
founded
has
recently
been
paved
with
concrete
transformed
into
a
tennis
court
and
now
echoes
to
the
shouts
of
students
to
whom
giesecke
the
successful
president
is
teaching
the
truth
of
the
ancient
axiom
mens
sana
in
corpore
sano
modern
cuzco
is
a
city
of
about
people
although
it
is
the
political
capital
of
the
most
important
department
in
southern
peru
it
had
in
only
one
hospital
a
organization
on
the
west
of
the
city
next
door
to
the
largest
cemetery
in
fact
so
far
away
is
it
from
everything
else
and
so
close
to
the
cemetery
that
the
funeral
wreaths
and
the
more
prominent
monuments
are
almost
the
only
interesting
things
which
the
patients
have
to
look
at
the
building
has
large
courtyards
and
open
colonnades
which
would
afford
ideal
conditions
for
patients
able
to
take
advantage
of
treatment
at
the
time
of
surgeon
visit
he
found
the
patients
were
all
kept
in
wards
whose
windows
were
small
and
practically
always
closed
and
shuttered
so
that
the
atmosphere
was
close
and
the
light
insufficient
one
could
hardly
imagine
a
stronger
contrast
than
exists
between
such
wards
and
those
to
which
we
are
accustomed
in
the
united
states
where
the
maximum
of
sunlight
and
fresh
air
is
sought
and
patients
are
encouraged
to
sit
and
even
have
their
cots
on
porches
there
was
no
resident
physician
the
utmost
care
was
taken
throughout
the
hospital
to
have
everything
as
dark
as
possible
thus
conforming
to
the
ancient
mountain
traditions
regarding
the
evil
effects
of
sunlight
and
fresh
air
needless
to
say
the
hospital
has
a
high
mortality
and
a
very
poor
local
reputation
yet
it
is
the
only
hospital
in
the
department
outside
of
cuzco
in
all
the
towns
we
visited
there
was
no
provision
for
caring
for
the
sick
except
in
their
own
homes
in
the
larger
places
there
are
shops
where
some
of
the
more
common
drugs
may
be
obtained
but
in
the
great
majority
of
towns
and
villages
no
modern
medicines
can
be
purchased
no

of

is
still
preserved
one
of
the
most
exquisite
bits
of
inca
stonework
to
be
seen
in
peru
one
wonders
whether
it
is
all
that
is
left
of
a
fine
palace
or
whether
it
represents
the
last
efforts
of
a
dying
dynasty
to
erect
a
suitable
residence
for
titu
cusi
cousin
it
is
carefully
preserved
by
don
cesare
lomellini
the
leading
business
man
of
cuzco
a
merchant
prince
of
italian
origin
who
is
at
once
a
banker
an
exporter
of
hides
and
other
country
produce
and
an
importer
of
merchandise
of
every
description
including
pencils
and
sugar
mills
lumber
and
hats
candy
and
hardware
he
is
also
an
amateur
of
spanish
colonial
furniture
as
well
as
of
the
beautiful
pottery
of
the
incas
furthermore
he
has
always
found
time
to
turn
aside
from
the
pressing
cares
of
his
large
business
to
assist
our
expeditions
he
has
frequently
brought
us
in
touch
with
the
owners
of
country
estates
or
given
us
letters
of
introduction
so
that
our
paths
were
made
easy
he
has
provided
us
with
storerooms
for
our
equipment
assisted
us
in
procuring
trustworthy
muleteers
seen
to
it
that
we
were
not
swindled
in
local
purchases
of
mules
and
pack
saddles
given
us
invaluable
advice
in
overcoming
difficulties
and
in
a
word
placed
himself
wholly
at
our
disposal
just
as
though
we
were
his
most
desirable
and
clients
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
never
was
willing
to
receive
any
compensation
for
the
many
favors
he
showed
us
so
important
a
factor
was
he
in
the
success
of
our
expeditions
that
he
deserves
to
be
gratefully
remembered
by
all
friends
of
exploration
above
his
country
house
at
colcampata
is
the
hill
of
sacsahuaman
it
is
possible
to
scramble
up
its
face
but
only
by
making
more
exertion
than
is
desirable
at
this
altitude
feet
the
easiest
way
to
reach
the
famous
fortress
is
by
following
the
course
of
the
little
tullumayu
feeble
stream
the
easternmost
of
the
three
canalized
streams
which
divide
cuzco
into
four
parts
on
its
banks
one
first
passes
a
tannery
and
then
a
short
distance
up
a
steep
gorge
the
remains
of
an
old
mill
the
stone
flume
and
the
adjoining
ruins
are
commonly
ascribed
by
the
people
of
cuzco
to
the
incas
but
do
not
look
to
me
like
inca
stonework
since
the
incas
did
not
understand
the
mechanical
principle
of
the
wheel
it
is
hardly
likely
that
they
would
have
known
how
to
make
any
use
of
water
power
finally
careful
examination
of
the
flume
discloses
the
presence
of
lead
cement
a
substance
unknown
in
inca
masonry
a
little
farther
up
the
stream
one
passes
through
a
massive
megalithic
gateway
and
finds
one
self
in
the
presence
of
the
astounding
cyclopean
walls
of
sacsahuaman
described
in
across
south
america
here
the
ancient
builders
constructed
three
great
terraces
which
extend
one
above
another
for
a
third
of
a
mile
across
the
hill
between
two
deep
gulches
the
lowest
terrace
of
the
fortress
is
faced
with
colossal
boulders
many
of
which
weigh
ten
tons
and
some
weigh
more
than
twenty
tons
yet
all
are
fitted
together
with
the
utmost
precision
i
have
visited
sacsahuaman
repeatedly
each
time
it
invariably
overwhelms
and
astounds
to
a
superstitious
indian
who
sees
these
walls
for
the
first
time
they
must
seem
to
have
been
built
by
gods
about
a
mile
northeast
of
sacsahuaman
are
several
small
artificial
hills
partly
covered
with
vegetation
which
seem
to
be
composed
entirely
of
rock
chips
chips
from
the
great
limestone
blocks
quarried
here
for
the
fortress
and
later
conveyed
with
the
utmost
pains
down
to
sacsahuaman
they
represent
the
labor
of
countless
thousands
of
quarrymen
even
in
modern
times
with
steam
drills
explosives
steel
tools
and
light
railways
these
hills
would
be
noteworthy
but
when
one
pauses
to
consider
that
none
of
these
mechanical
devices
were
known
to
the
ancient
stonemasons
and
that
these
mountains
of
stone
chips
were
made
with
stone
tools
and
were
all
carried
from
the
quarries
by
hand
it
fairly
staggers
the
imagination
the
ruins
of
sacsahuaman
represent
not
only
an
incredible
amount
of
human
labor
but
also
a
very
remarkable
governmental
organization
that
thousands
of
people
could
have
been
spared
from
agricultural
pursuits
for
so
long
a
time
as
was
necessary
to
extract
the
blocks
from
the
quarries
hew
them
to
the
required
shapes
transport
them
several
miles
over
rough
country
and
bond
them
together
in
such
an
intricate
manner
means
that
the
leaders
had
the
brains
and
ability
to
organize
and
arrange
the
affairs
of
a
very
large
population
such
a
folk
could
hardly
have
spent
much
time
in
drilling
or
preparing
for
warfare
their
building
operations
required
infinite
pains
endless
time
and
devoted
skill
such
qualities
could
hardly
have
been
called
forth
even
by
powerful
monarchs
had
not
the
results
been
pleasing
to
the
great
majority
of
their
people
people
who
were
primarily
agriculturists
they
had
learned
to
avert
hunger
and
famine
by
relying
on
carefully
built
terraces
which
would
prevent
their
fields
being
carried
off
and
spread
over
the
plains
of
the
amazon
it
seems
to
me
possible
that
sacsahuaman
was
built
in
accordance
with
their
desires
to
please
their
gods
is
it
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
a
people
to
whom
terraces
meant
so
much
in
the
way
of
food
should
have
sometimes
built
massive
terraces
of
cyclopean
character
like
sacsahuaman
as
an
offering
to
the
deity
who
first
taught
them
terrace
construction
this
seems
to
me
a
more
likely
object
for
the
gigantic
labor
involved
in
the
construction
of
sacsahuaman
than
its
possible
usefulness
as
a
fortress
equally
strong
defenses
against
an
enemy
attempting
to
attack
the
hilltop
back
of
cuzco
might
have
been
constructed
of
smaller
stones
in
an
infinitely
shorter
time
with
far
less
labor
and
pains
such
a
display
of
the
power
to
control
the
labor
of
thousands
of
individuals
and
force
them
to
superhuman
efforts
on
an
unproductive
undertaking
which
in
its
agricultural
or
strategic
results
was
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
obvious
cost
might
have
been
caused
by
the
supreme
vanity
of
a
great
soldier
on
the
other
hand
the
ancient
peruvians
were
religious
rather
than
warlike
more
inclined
to
worship
the
sun
than
to
fight
great
battles
was
sacsahuaman
due
to
the
desire
to
please
at
whatever
cost
the
god
that
fructified
the
crops
which
grew
on
terraces
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
spanish
conquerors
warriors
themselves
and
descendants
of
twenty
generations
of
a
fighting
race
accustomed
as
they
were
to
the
salients
of
european
fortresses
should
have
looked
upon
sacsahuaman
as
a
fortress
to
them
the
military
use
of
its
bastions
was
perfectly
obvious
the
value
of
its
salients
and
reëntrant
angles
was
not
likely
to
be
overlooked
for
it
had
been
only
recently
acquired
by
their
crusading
ancestors
the
height
and
strength
of
its
powerful
walls
enabled
it
to
be
of
the
greatest
service
to
the
soldiers
of
that
day
they
saw
that
it
was
virtually
impregnable
for
any
artillery
with
which
they
were
familiar
in
fact
in
the
wars
of
the
incas
and
those
which
followed
pizarro
entry
into
cuzco
sacsahuaman
was
repeatedly
used
as
a
fortress
so
it
probably
never
occurred
to
the
spaniards
that
the
peruvians
who
knew
nothing
of
explosive
powder
or
the
use
of
artillery
did
not
construct
sacsahuaman
in
order
to
withstand
such
a
siege
as
the
fortresses
of
europe
were
only
too
familiar
with
so
natural
did
it
seem
to
the
first
europeans
who
saw
it
to
regard
it
as
a
fortress
that
it
has
seldom
been
thought
of
in
any
other
way
the
fact
that
the
sacred
city
of
cuzco
was
more
likely
to
be
attacked
by
invaders
coming
up
the
valley
or
even
over
the
gentle
slopes
from
the
west
or
through
the
pass
from
the
north
which
for
centuries
has
been
used
as
part
of
the
main
highway
of
the
central
andes
never
seems
to
have
troubled
writers
who
regarded
sacsahuaman
essentially
as
a
fortress
it
may
be
that
sacsahuaman
was
once
used
as
a
place
where
the
votaries
of
the
sun
gathered
at
the
end
of
the
rainy
season
to
celebrate
the
vernal
equinox
and
at
the
summer
solstice
to
pray
for
the
sun
return
from
his
farthest
north
in
any
case
i
believe
that
the
enormous
cost
of
its
construction
shows
that
it
was
probably
intended
for
religious
rather
than
military
purposes
it
is
more
likely
to
have
been
an
ancient
shrine
than
a
mighty
fortress
it
now
becomes
necessary
in
order
to
explain
my
explorations
north
of
cuzco
to
ask
the
reader
attention
to
a
brief
account
of
the
last
four
incas
who
ruled
over
any
part
of
peru
chapter
ix
the
last
four
incas
readers
of
prescott
charming
classic
the
conquest
of
peru
will
remember
that
pizarro
after
killing
atahualpa
the
inca
who
had
tried
in
vain
to
avoid
his
fate
by
filling
a
room
with
vessels
of
gold
decided
to
establish
a
native
prince
on
the
throne
of
the
incas
to
rule
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
spain
the
young
prince
manco
a
son
of
the
great
inca
huayna
capac
named
for
the
first
inca
manco
ccapac
the
founder
of
the
dynasty
was
selected
as
the
most
acceptable
figurehead
he
was
a
young
man
of
ability
and
spirit
his
induction
into
office
in
with
appropriate
ceremonies
the
barbaric
splendor
of
which
only
made
the
farce
the
more
pitiful
did
little
to
gratify
his
natural
ambition
as
might
have
been
foreseen
he
chafed
under
restraint
escaped
as
soon
as
possible
from
his
attentive
guardians
and
raised
an
army
of
faithful
quichuas
there
followed
the
siege
of
cuzco
briefly
characterized
by
don
alonzo
enriques
de
guzman
who
took
part
in
it
as
the
most
fearful
and
cruel
war
in
the
world
when
in
cuzco
was
relieved
by
pizarro
comrade
almagro
and
manco
last
chance
of
regaining
the
ancient
capital
of
his
ancestors
failed
the
inca
retreated
to
ollantaytambo
here
on
the
banks
of
the
river
urubamba
manco
made
a
determined
stand
but
ollantaytambo
was
too
easily
reached
by
mounted
cavaliers
the
inca
followers
although
aroused
to
their
utmost
endeavors
by
the
presence
of
the
magnificent
stone
edifices
fortresses
granaries
palaces
and
hanging
gardens
of
their
ancestors
found
it
necessary
to
retreat
they
fled
in
a
northerly
direction
and
made
good
their
escape
over
snowy
passes
to
uiticos
in
the
fastnesses
of
uilcapampa
a
veritable
american
switzerland
figure
glaciers
between
cuzco
and
uiticos
the
spaniards
who
attempted
to
follow
manco
found
his
position
practically
impregnable
the
citadel
of
uilcapampa
a
gigantic
natural
fortress
defended
by
nature
in
one
of
her
profoundest
moods
was
only
to
be
reached
by
fording
dangerous
torrents
or
crossing
the
mountains
by
narrow
defiles
which
themselves
are
higher
than
the
most
lofty
peaks
of
europe
it
was
hazardous
for
hannibal
and
napoleon
to
bring
their
armies
through
the
comparatively
low
passes
of
the
alps
pizarro
found
it
impossible
to
follow
the
inca
manco
over
the
pass
of
panticalla
itself
a
snowy
wilderness
higher
than
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
in
no
part
of
the
peruvian
andes
are
there
so
many
beautiful
snowy
peaks
near
by
is
the
sharp
icy
pinnacle
of
mt
veronica
elevation
not
far
away
is
another
magnificent
peak
mt
salcantay
feet
above
the
sea
near
salcantay
is
the
sharp
needle
of
mt
soray
while
to
the
west
of
it
are
panta
and
soiroccocha
on
the
shoulders
of
these
mountains
are
unnamed
glaciers
and
little
valleys
that
have
scarcely
ever
been
seen
except
by
some
hardy
prospector
or
inquisitive
explorer
these
valleys
are
to
be
reached
only
through
passes
where
the
traveler
is
likely
to
be
waylaid
by
violent
storms
of
hail
and
snow
during
the
rainy
season
a
large
part
of
uilcapampa
is
absolutely
impenetrable
even
in
the
dry
season
the
difficulties
of
transportation
are
very
great
the
most
mule
is
sometimes
unable
to
use
the
trails
without
assistance
from
man
it
was
an
ideal
place
for
the
inca
manco
the
conquistador
cieza
de
leon
who
wrote
in
a
graphic
account
of
the
wars
of
peru
says
that
manco
took
with
him
a
great
quantity
of
treasure
collected
from
various
parts
and
many
loads
of
rich
clothing
of
wool
delicate
in
texture
and
very
beautiful
and
showy
the
spaniards
were
absolutely
unable
to
conceive
of
the
ruler
of
a
country
traveling
without
rich
treasure
it
is
extremely
doubtful
whether
manco
burdened
himself
with
much
gold
or
silver
except
for
ornament
there
was
little
use
to
which
he
could
have
put
the
precious
metals
and
they
would
have
served
only
to
arouse
the
cupidity
of
his
enemies
his
people
had
never
been
paid
in
gold
or
silver
their
labor
was
his
due
and
only
such
part
of
it
as
was
needed
to
raise
their
own
crops
and
make
their
own
clothing
was
allotted
to
them
in
fact
their
lives
were
in
his
hands
and
the
custom
and
usage
of
centuries
made
them
faithful
followers
of
their
great
chief
that
manco
however
actually
did
carry
off
with
him
beautiful
textiles
and
anything
else
which
was
useful
may
be
taken
for
granted
in
uiticos
safe
from
the
armed
forces
of
his
enemies
the
inca
was
also
able
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
a
delightful
climate
and
was
in
a
region
where
corn
potatoes
both
white
and
sweet
and
the
fruits
of
the
temperate
and
regions
easily
grow
using
this
as
a
base
he
was
accustomed
to
sally
forth
against
the
spaniards
frequently
and
in
unexpected
directions
his
raids
were
usually
successful
it
was
relatively
easy
for
him
with
a
handful
of
followers
to
dash
out
of
the
mountain
fastnesses
cross
the
apurimac
river
either
by
swimming
or
on
primitive
rafts
and
reach
the
great
road
between
cuzco
and
lima
the
principal
highway
of
peru
officials
and
merchants
whose
business
led
them
over
this
route
found
it
extremely
precarious
manco
cheered
his
followers
by
making
them
realize
that
in
these
raids
they
were
taking
sweet
revenge
on
the
spaniards
for
what
they
had
done
to
peru
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
cieza
de
leon
justifies
manco
in
his
attitude
for
the
spaniards
had
indeed
seized
his
inheritance
forcing
him
to
leave
his
native
land
and
to
live
in
banishment
manco
success
in
securing
such
a
place
of
refuge
and
in
using
it
as
a
base
from
which
he
could
frequently
annoy
his
enemies
led
many
of
the
orejones
of
cuzco
to
follow
him
the
inca
chiefs
were
called
orejones
big
ears
by
the
spaniards
because
the
lobes
of
their
ears
had
been
enlarged
artificially
to
receive
the
great
gold
earrings
which
they
were
fond
of
wearing
three
years
after
retirement
to
the
wilds
of
uilcapampa
there
was
born
in
cuzco
in
the
year
garcilasso
inca
de
la
vega
the
son
of
an
inca
princess
and
one
of
the
conquistadores
as
a
small
child
garcilasso
heard
of
the
activities
of
his
royal
relative
he
left
peru
as
a
boy
and
spent
the
rest
of
his
life
in
spain
after
forty
years
in
europe
he
wrote
partly
from
memory
his
royal
commentaries
an
account
of
the
country
of
his
indian
ancestors
of
the
inca
manco
of
whom
he
must
frequently
have
heard
uncomplimentary
reports
as
a
child
he
speaks
apologetically
he
says
in
the
time
of
manco
inca
several
robberies
were
committed
on
the
road
by
his
subjects
but
still
they
had
that
respect
for
the
spanish
merchants
that
they
let
them
go
free
and
never
pillaged
them
of
their
wares
and
merchandise
which
were
in
no
manner
useful
to
them
howsoever
they
robbed
the
indians
of
their
cattle
llamas
and
alpacas
bred
in
the
countrey
the
inca
lived
in
the
mountains
which
afforded
no
tame
cattel
and
only
produced
tigers
and
lions
and
serpents
of
and
thirty
feet
long
with
other
venomous
insects
i
am
quoting
from
sir
paul
rycaut
translation
published
in
london
in
garcilasso
says
manco
soldiers
took
only
such
food
as
they
found
in
the
hands
of
the
indians
which
the
inca
did
usually
call
his
own
saying
that
he
who
was
master
of
that
whole
empire
might
lawfully
challenge
such
a
proportion
thereof
as
was
convenient
to
supply
his
necessary
and
natural
support
a
reasonable
apology
and
yet
personally
i
doubt
whether
manco
spared
the
spanish
merchants
and
failed
to
pillage
them
of
their
wares
and
merchandise
as
will
be
seen
later
we
found
in
manco
palace
some
metal
articles
of
european
origin
which
might
very
well
have
been
taken
by
manco
raiders
furthermore
it
should
be
remembered
that
garcilasso
although
often
quoted
by
prescott
left
peru
when
he
was
sixteen
years
old
and
that
his
ideas
were
largely
colored
by
his
long
life
in
spain
and
his
natural
desire
to
extol
the
virtues
of
his
mother
people
a
brown
race
despised
by
the
white
europeans
for
whom
he
wrote
the
methods
of
warfare
and
the
weapons
used
by
manco
and
his
followers
at
this
time
are
thus
described
by
guzman
he
says
the
indians
had
no
defensive
arms
such
as
helmets
shields
and
armor
but
used
lances
arrows
dubs
axes
halberds
darts
and
slings
and
another
weapon
which
they
call
ayllas
the
bolas
consisting
of
three
round
stones
sewn
up
in
leather
and
each
fastened
to
a
cord
a
cubit
long
they
throw
these
at
the
horses
and
thus
bind
their
legs
together
and
sometimes
they
will
fasten
a
man
arms
to
his
sides
in
the
same
way
these
indians
are
so
expert
in
the
use
of
this
weapon
that
they
will
bring
down
a
deer
with
it
in
the
chase
their
principal
weapon
however
is
the
sling
with
it
they
will
hurl
a
huge
stone
with
such
force
that
it
will
kill
a
horse
in
truth
the
effect
is
little
less
great
than
that
of
an
arquebus
and
i
have
seen
a
stone
thus
hurled
from
a
sling
break
a
sword
in
two
pieces
which
was
held
in
a
man
hand
at
a
distance
of
thirty
paces
manco
raids
finally
became
so
annoying
that
pizarro
sent
a
small
force
from
cuzco
under
captain
villadiego
to
attack
the
inca
captain
villadiego
found
it
impossible
to
use
horses
although
he
realized
that
cavalry
was
the
important
arm
against
these
indians
confident
in
his
strength
and
in
the
efficacy
of
his
firearms
and
anxious
to
enjoy
the
spoils
of
a
successful
raid
against
a
chief
reported
to
be
traveling
surrounded
by
his
family
and
with
rich
treasure
he
pressed
eagerly
on
up
through
a
lofty
valley
toward
a
defile
in
the
mountains
probably
the
pass
of
panticalla
here
fatigued
and
exhausted
by
their
difficult
march
and
suffering
from
the
effects
of
the
altitude
his
men
found
themselves
ambushed
by
the
inca
who
with
a
small
party
little
more
than
eighty
indians
attacked
the
christians
who
numbered
or
thirty
and
killed
captain
villadiego
and
all
his
men
except
two
or
three
to
any
one
who
has
clambered
over
the
passes
of
the
cordillera
uilcapampa
it
is
not
surprising
that
this
military
expedition
was
a
failure
or
that
the
inca
warned
by
indians
posted
on
appropriate
vantage
points
could
have
succeeded
in
defeating
a
small
force
of
weary
soldiers
armed
with
the
heavy
blunderbuss
of
the
seventeenth
century
in
a
rocky
pass
protected
by
huge
boulders
and
surrounded
by
quantities
of
natural
ammunition
for
their
slings
it
must
have
been
relatively
simple
for
eighty
quichuas
who
could
hurl
a
huge
stone
with
such
force
that
it
would
kill
a
horse
to
have
literally
stoned
to
death
captain
villadiego
little
company
before
they
could
have
prepared
their
clumsy
weapons
for
firing
figure
the
urubamba
canyon
a
reason
for
the
safety
of
the
incas
in
uilcapampa
the
fugitives
returned
to
cuzco
and
reported
their
misfortune
the
importance
of
the
reverse
will
be
better
appreciated
if
one
remembers
that
the
size
of
the
force
with
which
pizarro
conquered
peru
was
less
than
two
hundred
only
a
few
times
larger
than
captain
company
which
had
been
wiped
out
by
manco
its
significance
is
further
increased
by
the
fact
that
the
contemporary
spanish
writers
with
all
their
tendency
to
exaggerate
placed
manco
force
at
only
a
little
more
than
eighty
indians
probably
there
were
not
even
that
many
the
wonder
is
that
the
inca
army
was
not
reported
as
being
several
thousand
francisco
pizarro
himself
now
hastily
set
out
with
a
body
of
soldiers
determined
to
punish
this
young
inca
who
had
inflicted
such
a
blow
on
the
prestige
of
spanish
arms
but
this
attempt
also
failed
for
the
inca
had
withdrawn
across
the
rivers
and
mountains
of
uilcapampa
to
uiticos
where
according
to
cieza
de
leon
he
cheered
his
followers
with
the
sight
of
the
heads
of
his
enemies
unfortunately
for
accuracy
the
custom
of
displaying
on
the
ends
of
pikes
the
heads
of
enemies
was
european
and
not
peruvian
to
be
sure
the
savage
indians
of
some
of
the
amazonian
jungles
do
sometimes
decapitate
their
enemies
remove
the
bones
of
the
skull
dry
the
shrunken
scalp
and
face
and
wear
the
trophy
as
a
mark
of
prowess
just
as
the
north
american
indians
did
the
scalps
of
their
enemies
such
customs
had
no
place
among
the
inca
agriculturists
of
central
peru
there
were
no
spaniards
living
with
manco
at
that
time
to
report
any
such
outrage
on
the
bodies
of
captain
villadiego
unfortunate
men
probably
the
conquistadores
supposed
that
manco
did
what
the
spaniards
would
have
done
under
similar
circumstances
following
the
failure
of
francisco
pizarro
to
penetrate
to
uiticos
his
brother
gonzalo
undertook
the
pursuit
of
the
inca
and
occupied
some
of
his
passes
and
bridges
but
was
unsuccessful
in
penetrating
the
mountain
labyrinth
being
less
foolhardy
than
captain
villadiego
he
did
not
come
into
actual
conflict
with
manco
unable
to
subdue
the
young
inca
or
prevent
his
raids
on
travelers
from
cuzco
to
lima
francisco
pizarro
with
the
assent
of
the
royal
officers
who
were
with
him
established
the
city
of
ayacucho
at
a
convenient
point
on
the
road
so
as
to
make
it
secure
for
travelers
nevertheless
according
to
montesinos
manco
caused
the
good
people
of
ayacucho
quite
a
little
trouble
finally
francisco
pizarro
having
taken
one
of
manco
wives
prisoner
with
other
indians
stripped
and
flogged
her
and
then
shot
her
to
death
with
arrows
accounts
of
what
happened
in
uiticos
under
the
rule
of
manco
are
not
very
satisfactory
father
calancha
who
published
in
his
coronica
moralizada
or
pious
account
of
the
missionary
activities
of
the
augustinians
in
peru
says
that
the
inca
manco
was
obeyed
by
all
the
indians
who
lived
in
a
region
extending
for
two
hundred
leagues
and
more
toward
the
east
and
toward
the
south
where
there
were
innumerable
indians
in
various
provinces
with
customary
monastic
zeal
and
proper
religious
fervor
father
calancha
accuses
the
inca
of
compelling
the
baptized
indians
who
fled
to
him
from
the
spaniards
to
abandon
their
new
faith
torturing
those
who
would
no
longer
worship
the
old
inca
idols
this
story
need
not
be
taken
too
literally
although
undoubtedly
the
escaped
indians
acted
as
though
they
had
never
been
baptized
besides
indians
fleeing
from
harsh
masters
there
came
to
uilcapampa
in
gomez
perez
diego
mendez
and
half
a
dozen
other
spanish
fugitives
adherents
of
almagro
rascals
says
calancha
worthy
of
manco
favor
obliged
by
the
civil
wars
of
the
conquistadores
to
flee
from
the
pizarros
they
were
glad
enough
to
find
a
welcome
in
uiticos
to
while
away
the
time
they
played
games
and
taught
the
inca
checkers
and
chess
as
well
as
and
quoits
montesinos
says
they
also
taught
him
to
ride
horseback
and
shoot
an
arquebus
they
took
their
games
very
seriously
and
occasionally
violent
disputes
arose
one
of
which
as
we
shall
see
was
to
have
fatal
consequences
they
were
kept
informed
by
manco
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
viceroyalty
although
encompassed
within
craggy
and
lofty
mountains
the
inca
was
thoroughly
cognizant
of
all
those
revolutions
which
might
be
of
benefit
to
him
perhaps
the
most
exciting
news
that
reached
uiticos
in
was
in
regard
to
the
arrival
of
the
first
spanish
viceroy
he
brought
the
new
laws
a
result
of
the
efforts
of
the
good
bishop
las
casas
to
alleviate
the
sufferings
of
the
indians
the
new
laws
provided
among
other
things
that
all
the
officers
of
the
crown
were
to
renounce
their
repartimientos
or
holdings
of
indian
serfs
and
that
compulsory
personal
service
was
to
be
entirely
abolished
repartimientos
given
to
the
conquerors
were
not
to
pass
to
their
heirs
but
were
to
revert
to
the
king
in
other
words
the
new
laws
gave
evidence
that
the
spanish
crown
wished
to
be
kind
to
the
indians
and
did
not
approve
of
the
pizarros
this
was
good
news
for
manco
and
highly
pleasing
to
the
refugees
they
persuaded
the
inca
to
write
a
letter
to
the
new
viceroy
asking
permission
to
appear
before
him
and
offer
his
services
to
the
king
the
spanish
refugees
told
the
inca
that
by
this
means
he
might
some
day
recover
his
empire
or
at
least
the
best
part
of
it
their
object
in
persuading
the
inca
to
send
such
a
message
to
the
viceroy
becomes
apparent
when
we
learn
that
they
also
wrote
as
from
themselves
desiring
a
pardon
for
what
was
past
and
permission
to
return
to
spanish
dominions
gomez
perez
who
seems
to
have
been
the
active
leader
of
the
little
group
was
selected
to
be
the
bearer
of
the
letters
from
the
inca
and
the
refugees
attended
by
a
dozen
indians
whom
the
inca
instructed
to
act
as
his
servants
and
bodyguard
he
left
uilcapampa
presented
his
letters
to
the
viceroy
and
gave
him
a
large
relation
of
the
state
and
condition
of
the
inca
and
of
his
true
and
real
designs
to
doe
him
service
the
joyfully
received
the
news
and
granted
a
full
and
ample
pardon
of
all
crimes
as
desired
and
as
to
the
inca
he
made
many
kind
expressions
of
love
and
respect
truly
considering
that
the
interest
of
the
inca
might
be
advantageous
to
him
both
in
war
and
peace
and
with
this
satisfactory
answer
gomez
perez
returned
both
to
the
inca
and
to
his
companions
the
refugees
were
delighted
with
the
news
and
got
ready
to
return
to
king
and
country
their
departure
from
uiticos
was
prevented
by
a
tragic
accident
thus
described
by
garcilasso
the
inca
to
humour
the
spaniards
and
entertain
himself
with
them
had
given
directions
for
making
a
where
playing
one
day
with
gomez
perez
he
came
to
have
some
quarrel
and
difference
with
this
perez
about
the
measure
of
a
cast
which
often
happened
between
them
for
this
perez
being
a
person
of
a
hot
and
fiery
brain
without
any
judgment
or
understanding
would
take
the
least
occasion
in
the
world
to
contend
with
and
provoke
the
inca
being
no
longer
able
to
endure
his
rudeness
the
inca
punched
him
on
the
breast
and
bid
him
to
consider
with
whom
he
talked
perez
not
considering
in
his
heat
and
passion
either
his
own
safety
or
the
safety
of
his
companions
lifted
up
his
hand
and
with
the
bowl
struck
the
inca
so
violently
on
the
head
that
he
knocked
him
down
he
died
three
days
later
the
indians
hereupon
being
enraged
by
the
death
of
their
prince
joined
together
against
gomez
and
the
spaniards
who
fled
into
a
house
and
with
their
swords
in
their
hands
defended
the
door
the
indians
set
fire
to
the
house
which
being
too
hot
for
them
they
sallied
out
into
the
marketplace
where
the
indians
assaulted
them
and
shot
them
with
their
arrows
until
they
had
killed
every
man
of
them
and
then
afterwards
out
of
mere
rage
and
fury
they
designed
either
to
eat
them
raw
as
their
custome
was
or
to
burn
them
and
cast
their
ashes
into
the
river
that
no
sign
or
appearance
might
remain
of
them
but
at
length
after
some
consultation
they
agreed
to
cast
their
bodies
into
the
open
fields
to
be
devoured
by
vulters
and
birds
of
the
air
which
they
supposed
to
be
the
highest
indignity
and
dishonour
that
they
could
show
to
their
corps
garcilasso
concludes
i
informed
myself
very
perfectly
from
those
chiefs
and
nobles
who
were
present
and
of
the
unparalleled
piece
of
madness
of
that
rash
and
fool
and
heard
them
tell
this
story
to
my
mother
and
parents
with
tears
in
their
eyes
there
are
many
versions
of
the
tragedy
they
all
agree
that
a
spaniard
murdered
the
inca
thus
in
the
reign
of
an
attractive
and
vigorous
personality
was
brought
to
an
abrupt
close
manco
left
three
young
sons
sayri
tupac
titu
cusi
and
tupac
amaru
sayri
tupac
although
he
had
not
yet
reached
his
majority
became
inca
in
his
father
stead
and
with
the
aid
of
regents
reigned
for
ten
years
without
disturbing
his
spanish
neighbors
or
being
annoyed
by
them
unless
the
reference
in
montesinos
to
a
proposed
burning
of
bridges
near
abancay
under
date
of
is
correct
by
a
curious
lapse
montesinos
ascribes
this
attempt
to
the
inca
manco
who
had
been
dead
for
ten
years
in
there
came
to
lima
a
new
viceroy
who
decided
that
it
would
be
safer
if
young
sayri
tupac
were
within
reach
instead
of
living
in
the
inaccessible
wilds
of
uilcapampa
the
viceroy
wisely
undertook
to
accomplish
this
difficult
matter
through
the
princess
beatrix
coya
an
aunt
of
the
inca
who
was
living
in
cuzco
she
took
kindly
to
the
suggestion
and
dispatched
to
uiticos
a
messenger
of
the
blood
royal
attended
by
indian
servants
the
journey
was
a
dangerous
one
bridges
were
down
and
the
treacherous
trails
were
impassable
sayri
regents
permitted
the
messenger
to
enter
uilcapampa
and
deliver
the
viceroy
invitation
but
were
not
inclined
to
believe
that
it
was
quite
so
attractive
as
appeared
on
the
surface
even
though
brought
to
them
by
a
kinsman
accordingly
they
kept
the
visitor
as
a
hostage
and
sent
a
messenger
of
their
own
to
cuzco
to
see
if
any
foul
play
could
be
discovered
and
also
to
request
that
one
john
sierra
a
more
trusted
cousin
be
sent
to
treat
in
this
matter
all
this
took
time
in
the
viceroy
becoming
impatient
dispatched
from
lima
friar
melchior
and
one
john
betanzos
who
had
married
the
daughter
of
the
unfortunate
inca
atahualpa
and
pretended
to
be
very
learned
in
his
wife
language
montesinos
says
he
was
a
great
linguist
they
started
off
quite
confidently
for
uiticos
taking
with
them
several
pieces
of
velvet
and
damask
and
two
cups
of
gilded
silver
as
presents
anxious
to
secure
the
honor
of
being
the
first
to
reach
the
inca
they
traveled
as
fast
as
they
could
to
the
chuquichaca
bridge
the
key
to
the
valley
of
uiticos
here
they
were
detained
by
the
soldiers
of
the
regents
a
day
or
so
later
john
sierra
the
cousin
from
cuzco
arrived
at
the
bridge
and
was
allowed
to
proceed
while
the
friar
and
betanzos
were
still
detained
john
sierra
was
welcomed
by
the
inca
and
his
nobles
and
did
his
best
to
encourage
sayri
tupac
to
accept
the
viceroy
offer
finally
john
betanzos
and
the
friar
were
also
sent
for
and
admitted
to
the
presence
of
the
inca
with
the
presents
which
the
viceroy
had
sent
sayri
tupac
first
idea
was
to
remain
free
and
independent
as
he
had
hitherto
done
so
he
requested
the
ambassadors
to
depart
immediately
with
their
silver
gilt
cups
they
were
sent
back
by
one
of
the
western
routes
across
the
apurimac
a
few
days
later
however
after
john
sierra
had
told
him
some
interesting
stories
of
life
in
cuzco
the
inca
decided
to
reconsider
the
matter
his
regents
had
a
long
debate
observed
the
flying
of
birds
and
the
nature
of
the
weather
but
according
to
garcilasso
made
no
inquiries
of
the
devil
the
omens
were
favorable
and
the
regents
finally
decided
to
allow
the
inca
to
accept
the
invitation
of
the
viceroy
sayri
tupac
anxious
to
see
something
of
the
world
went
directly
to
lima
traveling
in
a
litter
made
of
rich
materials
carried
by
relays
chosen
from
the
three
hundred
indians
who
attended
him
he
was
kindly
received
by
the
viceroy
and
then
went
to
cuzco
where
he
lodged
in
his
aunt
house
here
his
relatives
went
to
welcome
him
i
myself
says
garcilasso
went
in
the
name
of
my
father
i
found
him
then
playing
a
certain
game
used
amongst
the
indians
i
kissed
his
hands
and
delivered
my
message
he
commanded
me
to
sit
down
and
presently
they
brought
two
gilded
cups
of
that
liquor
made
of
mayz
chicha
which
scarce
contained
four
ounces
of
drink
he
took
them
both
and
with
his
own
hand
he
gave
one
of
them
to
me
he
drank
and
i
pledged
him
which
as
we
have
said
is
the
custom
of
civility
amongst
them
this
ceremony
being
past
he
asked
me
why
i
did
not
meet
him
at
uillcapampa
i
answered
him
as
i
am
but
a
youngman
the
governours
make
no
account
of
me
to
place
me
in
such
ceremonies
as
these
replied
the
inca
would
rather
have
seen
you
than
all
the
friers
and
fathers
in
town
as
i
was
going
away
i
made
him
a
submissive
bow
and
reverence
after
the
manner
of
the
indians
who
are
of
his
alliance
and
kindred
at
which
he
was
so
much
pleased
that
he
embraced
me
heartily
and
with
much
affection
as
appeared
by
his
countenance
sayri
tupac
now
received
the
sacred
red
fringe
of
inca
sovereignty
was
married
to
a
princess
of
the
blood
royal
joined
her
in
baptism
and
took
up
his
abode
in
the
beautiful
valley
of
yucay
a
journey
northeast
of
cuzco
and
never
returned
to
uiticos
his
only
daughter
finally
married
a
certain
captain
garcia
of
whom
more
anon
sayri
tupac
died
in
leaving
two
brothers
the
older
titu
cusi
yupanqui
illegitimate
and
the
younger
tupac
amaru
his
rightful
successor
an
inexperienced
youth
figure
yucay
last
home
of
sayri
tupac
the
throne
of
uiticos
was
seized
by
titu
cusi
the
new
inca
seems
to
have
been
suspicious
of
the
untimely
death
of
sayri
tupac
and
to
have
felt
that
the
spaniards
were
capable
of
more
foul
play
so
with
his
he
stayed
quietly
in
uilcapampa
their
first
visitor
so
far
as
we
know
was
diego
rodriguez
de
figueroa
who
wrote
an
interesting
account
of
uiticos
and
says
he
gave
the
inca
a
pair
of
scissors
he
was
unsuccessful
in
his
efforts
to
get
titu
cusi
to
go
to
cuzco
in
time
there
came
an
augustinian
missionary
friar
marcos
garcia
who
six
years
after
the
death
of
sayri
tupac
entered
the
rough
country
of
uilcapampa
a
land
of
moderate
wealth
large
rivers
and
the
usual
rains
whose
forested
mountains
says
father
calancha
are
magnificent
friar
marcos
had
a
hard
journey
the
bridges
were
down
the
roads
had
been
destroyed
and
the
passes
blocked
up
the
few
indians
who
did
occasionally
appear
in
cuzco
from
uilcapampa
said
the
friar
could
not
get
there
unless
he
should
be
able
to
change
himself
into
a
bird
however
with
that
courage
and
pertinacity
which
have
marked
so
many
missionary
enterprises
friar
marcos
finally
overcame
all
difficulties
and
reached
uiticos
the
missionary
chronicler
says
that
titu
cusi
was
far
from
glad
to
see
him
and
received
him
angrily
it
worried
him
to
find
that
a
spaniard
had
succeeded
in
penetrating
his
retreat
besides
the
inca
was
annoyed
to
have
any
one
preach
against
his
idolatries
titu
cusi
own
story
as
written
down
by
friar
marcos
does
not
agree
with
calancha
anyhow
friar
marcos
built
a
little
church
in
a
place
called
puquiura
where
many
of
the
inca
people
were
then
living
he
planted
crosses
in
the
fields
and
on
the
mountains
these
being
the
best
things
to
frighten
off
devils
he
suffered
many
insults
at
the
hands
of
the
chiefs
and
principal
followers
of
the
inca
some
of
them
did
it
to
please
the
devil
others
to
flatter
the
inca
and
many
because
they
disliked
his
sermons
in
which
he
scolded
them
for
their
vices
and
abominated
among
his
converts
the
possession
of
four
or
six
wives
so
they
punished
him
in
the
matter
of
food
and
forced
him
to
send
to
cuzco
for
victuals
the
convent
sent
him
which
was
for
him
a
most
delicious
banquet
within
a
year
or
so
another
augustinian
missionary
friar
diego
ortiz
left
cuzco
alone
for
uilcapampa
he
suffered
much
on
the
road
but
finally
reached
the
retreat
of
the
inca
and
entered
his
presence
in
company
with
friar
marcos
although
the
inca
was
not
too
happy
to
see
a
new
preacher
he
was
willing
to
grant
him
an
entrance
because
the
inca
thought
friar
diego
would
not
vex
him
nor
take
the
trouble
to
reprove
him
so
the
inca
gave
him
a
license
they
selected
the
town
of
huarancalla
which
was
populous
and
well
located
in
the
midst
of
a
number
of
other
little
towns
and
villages
there
was
a
distance
of
two
or
three
days
journey
from
one
convent
to
the
other
leaving
friar
marcos
in
puquiura
friar
diego
went
to
his
new
establishment
and
in
a
short
time
built
a
church
a
house
for
himself
and
a
hospital
all
poor
buildings
made
in
a
short
time
he
also
started
a
school
for
children
and
became
very
popular
as
he
went
about
healing
and
teaching
he
had
an
easier
time
than
friar
marcos
who
with
less
tact
and
no
skill
as
a
physician
was
located
nearer
the
center
of
the
inca
cult
the
principal
shrine
of
the
inca
is
described
by
father
calancha
as
follows
close
to
vitcos
or
uiticos
in
a
village
called
chuquipalpa
is
a
house
of
the
sun
and
in
it
a
white
rock
over
a
spring
of
water
where
the
devil
appears
as
a
visible
manifestation
and
was
worshipped
by
those
idolators
this
was
the
principal
mochadero
of
those
forested
mountains
the
word
is
the
common
name
which
the
indians
apply
to
their
places
of
worship
in
other
words
it
is
the
only
place
where
they
practice
the
sacred
ceremony
of
kissing
the
origin
of
this
the
principal
part
of
their
ceremonial
is
that
very
practice
which
job
abominates
when
he
solemnly
clears
himself
of
all
offences
before
god
and
says
to
him
all
these
punishments
and
even
greater
burdens
would
i
have
deserved
had
i
done
that
which
the
blind
gentiles
do
when
the
sun
rises
resplendent
or
the
moon
shines
clear
and
they
exult
in
their
hearts
and
extend
their
hands
toward
the
sun
and
throw
kisses
to
it
an
act
of
very
grave
iniquity
which
is
equivalent
to
denying
the
true
god
thus
does
the
ecclesiastical
chronicler
refer
to
the
practice
in
peru
of
that
particular
form
of
worship
of
the
heavenly
bodies
which
was
also
widely
spread
in
the
east
in
arabia
and
palestine
and
was
inveighed
against
by
mohammed
as
well
as
the
ancient
hebrew
prophets
apparently
this
ceremony
of
the
most
profound
resignation
and
reverence
was
practiced
in
chuquipalpa
close
to
uiticos
in
the
reign
of
the
inca
titu
cusi
calancha
goes
on
to
say
in
this
white
stone
of
the
aforesaid
house
of
the
sun
which
is
called
yurac
rumi
meaning
in
quichua
a
white
rock
there
attends
a
devil
who
is
captain
of
a
legion
he
and
his
legionaries
show
great
kindness
to
the
indian
idolators
but
great
terrors
to
the
catholics
they
abuse
with
hideous
cruelties
the
baptized
ones
who
now
no
longer
worship
them
with
kisses
and
many
of
the
indians
have
died
from
the
horrible
frights
these
devils
have
given
them
one
day
when
the
inca
and
his
mother
and
their
principal
chiefs
and
counselors
were
away
from
uiticos
on
a
visit
to
some
of
their
outlying
estates
friar
marcos
and
friar
diego
decided
to
make
a
spectacular
attack
on
this
particular
devil
who
was
at
the
great
white
rock
over
a
spring
of
water
the
two
monks
summoned
all
their
converts
to
gather
at
puquiura
in
the
church
or
the
neighboring
plaza
and
asked
each
to
bring
a
stick
of
firewood
in
order
that
they
might
burn
up
this
devil
who
had
tormented
them
an
innumerable
multitude
came
together
on
the
day
appointed
the
converted
indians
were
most
anxious
to
get
even
with
this
devil
who
had
slain
their
friends
and
inflicted
wounds
on
themselves
the
doubters
were
curious
to
see
the
result
the
inca
priests
were
there
to
see
their
god
defeat
the
christians
while
as
may
readily
be
imagined
the
rest
of
the
population
came
to
see
the
excitement
starting
out
from
pucyura
they
marched
to
the
temple
of
the
sun
in
the
village
of
chuquipalpa
close
to
uiticos
arrived
at
the
sacred
palisade
the
monks
raised
the
standard
of
the
cross
recited
their
orisons
surrounded
the
spring
the
white
rock
and
the
temple
of
the
sun
and
piled
high
the
firewood
then
having
exorcised
the
locality
they
called
the
devil
by
all
the
vile
names
they
could
think
of
to
show
their
lack
of
respect
and
finally
commanded
him
never
to
return
to
this
vicinity
calling
on
christ
and
the
virgin
they
applied
fire
to
the
wood
the
poor
devil
then
fled
roaring
in
a
fury
and
making
the
mountains
to
tremble
it
took
remarkable
courage
on
the
part
of
the
two
lone
monks
thus
to
desecrate
the
chief
shrine
of
the
people
among
whom
they
were
dwelling
it
is
almost
incredible
that
in
this
remote
valley
separated
from
their
friends
and
far
from
the
protecting
hand
of
the
spanish
viceroy
they
should
have
dared
to
commit
such
an
insult
to
the
religion
of
their
hosts
of
course
as
soon
as
the
inca
titu
cusi
heard
of
it
he
was
greatly
annoyed
his
mother
was
furious
they
returned
immediately
to
pucyura
the
chiefs
wished
to
slay
the
monks
and
tear
them
into
small
pieces
and
undoubtedly
would
have
done
so
had
it
not
been
for
the
regard
in
which
friar
diego
was
held
his
skill
in
curing
disease
had
so
endeared
him
to
the
indians
that
even
the
inca
himself
dared
not
punish
him
for
the
attack
on
the
temple
of
the
sun
friar
marcos
however
who
probably
originated
the
plan
and
had
done
little
to
gain
the
good
will
of
the
indians
did
not
fare
so
well
calancha
says
he
was
stoned
out
of
the
province
and
the
inca
threatened
to
kill
him
if
he
ever
should
return
friar
diego
particularly
beloved
by
those
indians
who
came
from
the
jungles
in
the
lower
valleys
was
allowed
to
remain
and
finally
became
a
trusted
friend
and
adviser
of
titu
cusi
one
day
a
spaniard
named
romero
an
adventurous
prospector
for
gold
was
found
penetrating
the
mountain
valleys
and
succeeded
in
getting
permission
from
the
inca
to
see
what
minerals
were
there
he
was
too
successful
both
gold
and
silver
were
found
among
the
hills
and
he
showed
enthusiastic
delight
at
his
good
fortune
the
inca
fearing
that
his
reports
might
encourage
others
to
enter
uilcapampa
put
the
unfortunate
prospector
to
death
notwithstanding
the
protestations
of
friar
diego
foreigners
were
not
wanted
in
uilcapampa
in
the
year
ten
years
after
the
accession
of
titu
cusi
to
the
inca
throne
in
uiticos
a
new
spanish
viceroy
came
to
cuzco
unfortunately
for
the
incas
don
francisco
de
toledo
an
indefatigable
soldier
and
administrator
was
excessively
bigoted
cruel
and
pitiless
furthermore
philip
ii
and
his
council
of
the
indies
had
decided
that
it
would
be
worth
while
to
make
every
effort
to
get
the
inca
out
of
uiticos
for
years
the
spanish
conquerors
had
occupied
cuzco
and
the
major
portion
of
peru
without
having
been
able
to
secure
the
submission
of
the
indians
who
lived
in
the
province
of
uilcapampa
it
would
be
a
great
feather
in
the
cap
of
toledo
if
he
could
induce
titu
cusi
to
come
and
live
where
he
would
always
be
accessible
to
spanish
authority
during
the
ensuing
rainy
season
after
an
unusually
lively
party
the
inca
got
soaked
had
a
chill
and
was
laid
low
in
the
meantime
the
viceroy
had
picked
out
a
cuzco
soldier
one
tilano
de
anaya
who
was
well
liked
by
the
inca
to
try
to
persuade
titu
cusi
to
come
to
cuzco
tilano
was
instructed
to
go
by
way
of
ollantaytambo
and
the
chuquichaca
bridge
luck
was
against
him
titu
cusi
illness
was
very
serious
friar
diego
his
physician
had
prescribed
the
usual
remedies
unfortunately
all
the
monk
skill
was
unavailing
and
his
royal
patient
died
the
remedies
were
held
by
titu
cusi
mother
and
her
counselors
to
be
responsible
the
poor
friar
had
to
suffer
the
penalty
of
death
for
having
caused
the
death
of
the
inca
the
third
son
of
manco
tupac
amaru
brought
up
as
a
playfellow
of
the
virgins
of
the
sun
in
the
temple
near
uiticos
and
now
happily
married
was
selected
to
rule
the
little
kingdom
his
brows
were
decked
with
the
scarlet
fringe
of
sovereignty
but
thanks
to
the
jealous
fear
of
his
powerful
illegitimate
brother
his
training
had
not
been
that
of
a
soldier
he
was
destined
to
have
a
brief
unhappy
existence
when
the
young
inca
counselors
heard
that
a
messenger
was
coming
from
the
viceroy
seven
warriors
were
sent
to
meet
him
on
the
road
tilano
was
preparing
to
spend
the
night
at
the
chuquichaca
bridge
when
he
was
attacked
and
killed
the
viceroy
heard
of
the
murder
of
his
ambassador
at
the
same
time
that
he
learned
of
the
martyrdom
of
friar
diego
a
blow
had
been
struck
at
the
very
heart
of
spanish
domination
if
the
representatives
of
the
of
heaven
and
the
messengers
of
the
viceroy
of
philip
ii
were
not
inviolable
then
who
was
safe
on
palm
sunday
the
energetic
toledo
surrounded
by
his
council
determined
to
make
war
on
the
unfortunate
young
tupac
amaru
and
give
a
reward
to
the
soldier
who
would
effect
his
capture
the
council
was
of
the
opinion
that
many
insurrections
might
be
raised
in
that
empire
by
this
young
heir
moreover
it
was
alledged
says
garcilasso
that
by
the
imprisonment
of
the
inca
all
that
treasure
might
be
discovered
which
appertained
to
former
kings
together
with
that
chain
of
gold
which
huayna
capac
commanded
to
be
made
for
himself
to
wear
on
the
great
and
solemn
days
of
their
festival
furthermore
the
chain
of
gold
with
the
remaining
treasure
belong
to
his
catholic
majesty
by
right
of
conquest
excuses
were
not
wanting
the
incas
must
be
exterminated
the
expedition
was
divided
into
two
parts
one
company
was
sent
by
way
of
limatambo
to
curahuasi
to
head
off
the
inca
in
case
he
should
cross
the
apurimac
and
try
to
escape
by
one
of
the
routes
which
had
formerly
been
used
by
his
father
manco
in
his
marauding
expeditions
the
other
company
under
general
martin
hurtado
and
captain
garcia
marched
from
cuzco
by
way
of
yucay
and
ollantaytambo
they
were
more
fortunate
than
captain
villadiego
whose
force
years
before
had
been
met
and
destroyed
at
the
pass
of
panticalla
that
was
in
the
days
of
the
active
inca
manco
now
there
was
no
force
defending
this
important
pass
they
descended
the
lucumayo
to
its
junction
with
the
urubamba
and
came
to
the
bridge
of
chuquichaca
the
narrow
suspension
bridge
built
of
native
fibers
sagged
deeply
in
the
middle
and
swayed
so
threateningly
over
the
gorge
of
the
urubamba
that
only
one
man
could
pass
it
at
a
time
the
rapid
river
was
too
deep
to
be
forded
there
were
no
canoes
it
would
have
been
a
difficult
matter
to
have
constructed
rafts
for
most
of
the
trees
that
grow
here
are
of
hard
wood
and
do
not
float
on
the
other
side
of
the
urubamba
was
young
tupac
amaru
surrounded
by
his
councilors
chiefs
and
soldiers
the
first
hostile
forces
which
in
time
had
endeavored
to
fight
their
way
into
uilcapampa
had
never
been
allowed
by
manco
to
get
as
far
as
this
his
youngest
son
tupac
amaru
had
had
no
experience
in
these
matters
the
chiefs
and
nobles
had
failed
to
defend
the
pass
and
they
now
failed
to
destroy
the
chuquichaca
bridge
apparently
relying
on
their
ability
to
take
care
of
one
spanish
soldier
at
a
time
and
prevent
the
spaniards
from
crossing
the
narrow
swaying
structure
general
hurtado
was
not
taking
any
such
chances
he
had
brought
with
him
one
or
two
light
mountain
field
pieces
with
which
the
raw
troops
of
the
inca
were
little
acquainted
the
sides
of
the
valley
at
this
point
rise
steeply
from
the
river
and
the
reverberations
caused
by
gun
fire
would
be
fairly
terrifying
to
those
who
had
never
heard
anything
like
it
before
a
few
volleys
from
the
guns
and
the
arquebuses
and
the
indians
fled
pellmell
in
every
direction
leaving
the
bridge
undefended
captain
garcia
who
had
married
the
daughter
of
sayri
tupac
was
sent
in
pursuit
of
the
inca
his
men
found
the
road
narrow
in
the
ascent
with
forest
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
a
ravine
of
great
depth
it
was
only
a
footpath
barely
wide
enough
for
two
men
to
pass
garcia
with
customary
spanish
bravery
marched
at
the
head
of
his
company
suddenly
out
of
the
thick
forest
an
inca
chieftain
named
hualpa
endeavoring
to
protect
the
flight
of
tupac
amaru
sprang
on
garcia
held
him
so
that
he
could
not
get
at
his
sword
and
endeavored
to
hurl
him
over
the
cliff
the
captain
life
was
saved
by
a
faithful
indian
servant
who
was
following
immediately
behind
him
carrying
his
sword
drawing
it
from
the
scabbard
with
much
dexterity
and
animation
the
indian
killed
hualpa
and
saved
his
master
life
garcia
fought
several
battles
took
some
forts
and
succeeded
in
capturing
many
prisoners
from
them
it
was
learned
that
the
inca
had
gone
inland
toward
the
valley
of
simaponte
and
that
he
was
flying
to
the
country
of
the
mañaries
indians
a
warlike
tribe
and
his
friends
where
balsas
and
canoes
were
posted
to
save
him
and
enable
him
to
escape
nothing
daunted
by
the
dangers
of
the
jungle
nor
the
rapids
of
the
river
garcia
finally
managed
to
construct
five
rafts
on
which
he
put
some
of
his
soldiers
accompanying
them
himself
he
descended
the
rapids
escaping
death
many
times
by
swimming
and
finally
arrived
at
a
place
called
momori
only
to
find
that
the
inca
learning
of
their
approach
had
gone
farther
into
the
woods
garcia
followed
hard
after
although
he
and
his
men
were
by
this
time
barefooted
and
suffering
from
want
of
food
they
finally
captured
the
inca
garcilasso
says
that
tupac
amaru
considering
that
he
had
not
people
to
make
resistance
and
that
he
was
not
conscious
to
himself
of
any
crime
or
disturbance
he
had
done
or
raised
suffered
himself
to
be
taken
choosing
rather
to
entrust
himself
in
the
hands
of
the
spaniards
than
to
perish
in
those
mountains
with
famine
or
be
drowned
in
those
great
rivers
the
spaniards
in
this
manner
seizing
on
the
inca
and
on
all
the
indian
men
and
women
who
were
in
company
with
him
amongst
which
was
his

two

place
the
went
so
soon
as

was

of
the
imprisonment
of
the
poor

a

was
held
the

of

about
one

this

copied
by
some

including
mercator
until
about
when

disappeared
from

of

the
map
makers
had
learned
that
there

no
such

in

its

about
three

figure
part
of

of

the

of
peru
the
work
of
that
remarkable
explorer
raimondi
who
spent
his
life
crossing
and
recrossing
peru
does
not
contain
the
word
uiticos
nor
any
of
its
numerous
spellings
viticos
vitcos
pitcos
or
biticos
incidentally
it
may
seem
strange
that
uiticos
could
ever
be
written
biticos
the
quichua
language
has
no
sound
of
the
early
spanish
writers
however
wrote
the
capital
letter
u
exactly
like
a
capital
in
official
documents
and
letters
uiticos
became
viticos
the
official
readers
who
had
never
heard
the
word
pronounced
naturally
used
the
v
sound
instead
of
the
u
sound
both
v
and
p
easily
become
b
so
uiticos
became
biticos
and
uilcapampa
became
vilcabamba
raimondi
marvelous
energy
led
him
to
penetrate
to
more
peruvian
villages
than
any
one
had
ever
done
before
or
is
likely
to
do
again
he
stopped
at
nothing
in
the
way
of
natural
obstacles
in
he
went
deep
into
the
heart
of
uilcapampa
yet
found
no
uiticos
he
believed
that
the
ruins
of
choqquequirau
represented
the
residence
of
the
last
incas
this
view
had
been
held
by
the
french
explorer
count
de
sartiges
in
who
believed
that
choqquequirau
was
abandoned
when
sayri
tupac
manco
oldest
son
went
to
live
in
yucay
view
was
also
held
by
the
leading
peruvian
geographers
including
paz
soldan
in
and
by
prefect
nuñez
and
his
friends
in
at
the
time
of
my
visit
to
choqquequirau
the
only
dissenter
was
the
learned
peruvian
historian
don
carlos
romero
who
insisted
that
the
last
inca
capital
must
be
found
elsewhere
he
urged
the
importance
of
searching
for
uiticos
in
the
valleys
of
the
rivers
now
called
vilcabamba
and
urubamba
it
was
to
be
the
work
of
the
yale
peruvian
expedition
of
to
collect
the
geographical
evidence
which
would
meet
the
requirements
of
the
chronicles
and
establish
the
whereabouts
of
the
inca
capital
that
there
were
undescribed
and
unidentified
ruins
to
be
found
in
the
urubamba
valley
was
known
to
a
few
people
in
cuzco
mostly
wealthy
planters
who
had
large
estates
in
the
province
of
convencion
one
told
us
that
he
went
to
santa
ana
every
year
and
was
acquainted
with
a
muleteer
who
had
told
him
of
some
interesting
ruins
near
the
san
miguel
bridge
knowing
the
propensity
of
his
countrymen
to
exaggerate
however
he
placed
little
confidence
in
the
story
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
had
crossed
the
bridge
a
score
of
times
without
taking
the
trouble
to
look
into
the
matter
another
señor
pancorbo
whose
plantation
was
in
the
vilcabamba
valley
said
that
he
had
heard
vague
rumors
of
ruins
in
the
valley
above
his
plantation
particularly
near
pucyura
if
his
story
should
prove
to
be
correct
then
it
was
likely
that
this
might
be
the
very
puquiura
where
friar
marcos
had
established
the
first
church
in
the
province
of
uilcapampa
but
that
was
near
uiticos
and
near
a
village
called
chuquipalpa
where
should
be
found
the
ruins
of
a
temple
of
the
sun
and
in
these
ruins
a
white
rock
over
a
spring
of
water
yet
neither
these
friendly
planters
nor
the
friends
among
whom
they
inquired
had
ever
heard
of
uiticos
or
a
place
called
chuquipalpa
or
of
such
an
interesting
rock
nor
had
they
themselves
seen
the
ruins
of
which
they
had
heard
one
of
señor
lomellini
friends
a
talkative
old
fellow
who
had
spent
a
large
part
of
his
life
in
prospecting
for
mines
in
the
department
of
cuzco
said
that
he
had
seen
ruins
finer
than
choqquequirau
at
a
place
called
huayna
picchu
but
he
had
never
been
to
choqquequirau
those
who
knew
him
best
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
did
not
seem
to
place
much
confidence
in
his
word
too
often
he
had
been
about
mines
which
did
not
pan
out
yet
his
report
resembled
that
of
charles
wiener
a
french
explorer
who
about
in
the
course
of
his
wanderings
in
the
andes
visited
ollantaytambo
while
there
he
was
told
that
there
were
fine
ruins
down
the
urubamba
valley
at
a
place
called
or
he
decided
to
go
down
the
valley
and
look
for
these
ruins
according
to
his
text
he
crossed
the
pass
of
panticalla
descended
the
lucumayo
river
to
the
bridge
of
choqquechacca
and
visited
the
lower
urubamba
returning
by
the
same
route
he
published
a
detailed
map
of
the
valley
to
one
of
its
peaks
he
gives
the
name
huaynapicchu
ele
and
to
another
matchopicchu
ele
his
interest
in
inca
ruins
was
very
keen
he
devotes
pages
to
ollantaytambo
he
failed
to
reach
machu
picchu
or
to
find
any
ruins
of
importance
in
the
urubamba
or
vilcabamba
valleys
could
we
hope
to
be
any
more
successful
would
the
rumors
that
had
reached
us
pan
out
as
badly
as
those
to
which
wiener
had
listened
so
eagerly
since
his
day
to
be
sure
the
peruvian
government
had
actually
finished
a
road
which
led
past
machu
picchu
on
the
other
hand
a
harvard
anthropological
expedition
under
the
leadership
of
william
farrabee
had
recently
been
over
this
road
without
reporting
any
ruins
of
importance
they
were
looking
for
savages
and
not
ruins
nevertheless
if
machu
picchu
was
finer
than
choqquequirau
why
had
no
one
pointed
it
out
to
them
figure
peruvian
expedition
of
to
most
of
our
friends
in
cuzco
the
idea
that
there
could
be
anything
finer
than
choqquequirau
seemed
absurd
they
regarded
that
cradle
of
gold
as
the
most
remarkable
archeological
discovery
of
recent
times
they
assured
us
there
was
nothing
half
so
good
they
even
assumed
that
we
were
secretly
planning
to
return
thither
to
dig
for
buried
treasure
denials
were
of
no
avail
to
a
people
whose
ancestors
made
fortunes
out
of
lucky
strikes
and
who
themselves
have
been
brought
up
on
stories
of
enormous
wealth
still
remaining
to
be
discovered
by
some
fortunate
excavator
the
question
of
tesoro
treasure
wealth
riches
is
an
source
of
conversation
even
the
prefect
of
cuzco
was
quite
unable
to
conceive
of
my
doing
anything
for
the
love
of
discovery
he
was
convinced
that
i
should
find
great
riches
at
choqquequirau
and
that
i
was
in
receipt
of
a
very
large
salary
he
refused
to
believe
that
the
members
of
the
expedition
received
no
more
than
their
expenses
he
told
me
confidentially
that
professor
foote
would
sell
his
collection
of
insects
for
at
least
peruvians
have
not
been
accustomed
to
see
any
one
do
scientific
work
except
as
he
was
paid
by
the
government
or
employed
by
a
railroad
or
mining
company
we
have
frequently
found
our
work
misunderstood
and
regarded
with
suspicion
even
by
the
cuzco
historical
society
the
valley
of
the
urubamba
or
uilcamayu
as
it
used
to
be
called
may
be
reached
from
cuzco
in
several
ways
the
usual
route
for
those
going
to
yucay
is
northwest
from
the
city
over
the
great
andean
highway
past
the
slopes
of
mt
sencca
at
the
road
crosses
the
lowest
pass
at
the
western
end
of
the
cuzco
basin
at
the
last
point
from
which
one
can
see
the
city
of
cuzco
all
true
indians
whether
on
their
way
out
of
the
valley
or
into
it
pause
turn
toward
the
east
facing
the
city
remove
their
hats
and
mutter
a
prayer
i
believe
that
the
words
they
use
now
are
those
of
the
ave
maria
or
some
other
familiar
orison
of
the
catholic
church
nevertheless
the
custom
undoubtedly
goes
far
back
of
the
advent
of
the
first
spanish
missionaries
it
is
probably
a
relic
of
the
ancient
habit
of
worshiping
the
rising
sun
during
the
centuries
immediately
preceding
the
conquest
the
city
of
cuzco
was
the
residence
of
the
inca
himself
that
divine
individual
who
was
at
once
the
head
of
church
and
state
nothing
would
have
been
more
natural
than
for
persons
coming
in
sight
of
his
residence
to
perform
an
act
of
veneration
this
in
turn
might
have
led
those
leaving
the
city
to
fall
into
the
same
habit
at
the
same
point
in
the
road
i
have
watched
hundreds
of
travelers
pass
this
point
none
of
those
whose
european
costume
proclaimed
a
white
or
mixed
ancestry
stopped
to
pray
or
make
obeisance
on
the
other
hand
all
those
without
exception
who
were
clothed
in
a
native
costume
which
betokened
that
they
considered
themselves
to
be
indians
rather
than
whites
paused
for
a
moment
gazing
at
the
ancient
city
removed
their
hats
and
said
a
short
prayer
leaving
we
went
northward
for
several
leagues
passed
the
town
of
chincheros
with
its
old
inca
walls
and
came
at
length
to
the
edge
of
the
wonderful
valley
of
yucay
in
its
bottom
are
great
level
terraces
rescued
from
the
urubamba
river
by
the
untiring
energy
of
the
ancient
folk
on
both
sides
of
the
valley
the
steep
slopes
bear
many
remains
of
narrow
terraces
some
of
which
are
still
in
use
above
them
are
temporales
fields
of
grain
resting
like
a
quilt
on
slopes
so
steep
it
seems
incredible
they
could
be
cultivated
still
higher
up
their
heads
above
the
clouds
are
the
jagged
peaks
the
whole
offers
a
marvelous
picture
rich
in
contrast
majestic
in
proportion
in
yucay
once
dwelt
the
inca
manco
oldest
son
sayri
tupac
after
he
had
accepted
the
invitation
to
come
under
spanish
protection
here
he
lived
three
years
and
here
in
he
died
an
untimely
death
under
circumstances
which
led
his
brothers
titu
cusi
and
tupac
amaru
to
think
that
they
would
be
safer
in
uiticos
we
spent
the
night
in
urubamba
the
modern
capital
of
the
province
much
favored
by
peruvians
of
because
of
its
abundant
water

and
rich

cuzco

is
too
high
to
have
charming

but
two
thousand

lower
in

there
is
everything
to
please
the
eye
and
delight

of
their

uru
is
the
quichua
word
for
caterpillars

pampa
means
flat
land
urubamba
is
had
it
been
named
by
people
who
came
up
from
a
warm
region
where
insects
abound
it
would
hardly
have
been
so
denominated
only
people
not
accustomed
to
land
where
caterpillars
and
grubs
flourished
would
have
been
struck
by
such
a
circumstance
consequently
the
valley
was
probably
named
by
plateau
dwellers
who
were
working
their
way
down
into
a
warm
region
where
butterflies
and
moths
are
more
common
notwithstanding
its
celebrated
caterpillars
urubamba
gardens
of
are
full
of
roses
lilies
and
other
brilliant
flowers
there
are
orchards
of
peaches
pears
and
apples
there
are
fields
where
luscious
strawberries
are
raised
for
the

the

not
get

to

ollantaytambo
described
in
glowing
terms
by
castelnau

and
squier
many
years
ago
it
has
lost
none
of
its
charm
even
though
drawings
are
imaginary
and
squier
are
exaggerated
here
as
at
urubamba
there
are
flower
gardens
and
highly
cultivated
green
fields
the
brooks
are
shaded
by
willows
and
poplars
above
them
are
magnificent
precipices
crowned
by
peaks
the
village
itself
was
once
the
capital
of
an
ancient
principality
whose
history
is
shrouded
in
mystery
there
are
ruins
of
curious
gabled
buildings
storehouses
prisons
or
monasteries
perched
here
and
there
on
inaccessible
crags
above
the
village
below
are
broad
terraces
of
unbelievable
extent
where
abundant
crops
are
still
harvested
terraces
which
will
stand
for
ages
to
come
as
monuments
to
the
energy
and
skill
of
a
bygone
race
the
fortress
is
on
a
little
hill
surrounded
by
steep
cliffs
high
walls
and
hanging
gardens
so
as
to
be
difficult
of
access
centuries
ago
when
the
tribe
which
cultivated
the
rich
fields
in
this
valley
lived
in
fear
and
terror
of
their
savage
neighbors
this
hill
offered
a
place
of
refuge
to
which
they
could
retire
it
may
have
been
fortified
at
that
time
as
centuries
passed
in
which
the
land
came
under
the
control
of
the
incas
whose
chief
interest
was
the
peaceful
promotion
of
agriculture
it
is
likely
that
this
fortress
became
a
royal
garden
the
six
great
ashlars

reddish
granite
weighing
fifteen
or
twenty
tons
each
and
placed
in

on

summit
of
the
hill
were
brought
from
a
quarry
several
miles
away
with
an
immense
amount
of
labor
and
pains
they
were
probably
intended
to
be
a
record
of
the
magnificence
of
an
able
ruler
not
only
could
he
command
the
services
of
a
sufficient
number
of
men
to
extract
these
rocks
from
the
quarry
and
carry
them
up
an
inclined
plane
from
the
bottom
of
the
valley
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
he
had
to
supply
the
men
with
food
the
building
of
such
a
monument
meant
taking
five
hundred
indians
away
from
their
ordinary
occupations
as
agriculturists
he
must
have
been
a
very
good
administrator
to
his
people
the
magnificent
megaliths
were
doubtless
a
source
of
pride
to
his
enemies
they
were
a
symbol
of
his

the

this

we
decided
not
to
use
either
pass
but
to
go
straight
down

us
into

too
dangerous
to
be
passable
and
precipices
which
can
be
scaled
only
with
great
effort
and
considerable
peril
at
one
time
a
footpath
probably
ran
near
the
river
where
the
indians
by
crawling
along
the
face
of
the
cliff
and
sometimes
swinging
from
one
ledge
to
another
on
hanging
vines
were
able
to
make
their
way
to
any
of
the
alluvial
terraces
down
the
valley
another
path
may
have
gone
over
the
cliffs
above
the
fortress
where
we
noticed
in
various
inaccessible
places
the
remains
of
walls
built
on
narrow
ledges
they
were
too
narrow
and
too
irregular
to
have
been
intended
to
support
agricultural
terraces
they
may
have
been
built
to
make
the
cliff
more
precipitous
they
probably
represent
the
foundations
of
an
old
trail
to
defend
these
ancient
paths
we
found
that
prehistoric
man
had
built
at
the
foot
of
the
precipices
close
to
the
river
a
small
but
powerful
fortress
whose
ruins
now
pass
by
the
name
of
salapunco
sala
ruins
punco
gateway
fashioned
after
famous
sacsahuaman
and
resembling
it
in
the
irregular
character
of
the
large
ashlars
and
also
by
reason
of
the
salients
and
reëntrant
angles
which
enabled
its
defenders
to
prevent
the
walls
being
successfully
scaled
it
presents
an
interesting
problem
commanding
as
it
does
the
entrance
to
the
valley
of
torontoy
salapunco
may
have
been
built
by
some
ancient
chief
to
enable
him
to
levy
tribute
on
all
who
passed
my
first
impression
was
that
the
fortress
was
placed
here
at
the
end
of
the
temperate
zone
to
defend
the
valleys
of
urubamba
and
ollantaytambo
against
savage
enemies
coming
up
from
the
forests
of
the
amazon
on
the
other
hand
it
is
possible
that
salapunco
was
built
by
the
tribes
occupying
the
fastnesses
of
uilcapampa
as
an
outpost
to
defend
them
against
enemies
coming
down
the
valley
from
the
direction
of
ollantaytambo
they
could
easily
have
held
it
against
a
considerable
force
for
it
is
powerfully
built
and
constructed
with
skill
supplies
from
the
plantations
of
torontoy
lower
down
the
river
might
have
reached
it
along
the
path
which
antedated
the
present
government
road
salapunco
may
have
been
occupied
by
the
troops
of
the
inca
manco
when
he
established
himself
in
uiticos
and
ruled
over
uilcapampa
he
could
hardly
however
have
built
a
megalithic
work
of
this
kind
it
is
more
likely
that
he
would
have
destroyed
the
narrow
trails
than
have
attempted
to
hold
the
fort
against
the
soldiers
of
pizarro
furthermore
its
style
and
character
seem
to
date
it
with
the
megalithic
structures
of
cuzco
and
ollantaytambo
this
makes
it
seem
all
the
more
extraordinary
that
salapunco
could
ever
have
been
built
as
a
defense
against
ollantaytambo
unless
it
was
built
by
folk
who
once
occupied
cuzco
and
who
later
found
a
retreat
in
the
canyons
below
here
figure
grosvenor
glacier
and
mt
salcantay
when
we
first
visited
salapunco
no
megalithic
remains
had
been
reported
as
far
down
the
valley
as
this
it
never
occurred
to
us
that
in
hunting
for
the
remains
of
such
comparatively
recent
structures
as
the
inca
manco
had
the
force
and
time
to
build
we
were
to
discover
remains
of
a
far
more
remote
past
yet
we
were
soon
to
find
ruins
enough
to
explain
why
such
a
fortress
as
salapunco
might
possibly
have
been
built
so
as
to
defend
uilcapampa
against
ollantaytambo
and
cuzco
and
not
those
inca
cities
against
the
savages
of
the
amazon
jungles
passing
salapunco
we
skirted
granite
cliffs
and
precipices
and
entered
a
most
interesting
region
where
we
were
surprised
and
charmed
by
the
extent
of
the
ancient
terraces
their
length
and
height
the
presence
of
many
inca
ruins
the
beauty
of
the
deep
narrow
valleys
and
the
grandeur
of
the
mountains
which
towered
above
them
across
the
river
near
qquente
on
top
of
a
series
of
terraces
we
saw
the
extensive
ruins
of

soldan
but
is
indicated
on
wiener
map
although
he
does
not
appear
to
have
visited
it
we
have
been
unable
to
find
any
reference
to
it
in
the
chronicles
we
spent
several
months
here
in
excavating
and
determining
the
character
of
the
ruins
in
another
volume
i
hope
to
tell
more
of
the
antiquities
of
this
region
at
present
it
must
suffice
to
remark
that
our
explorations
near
patallacta
disclosed
no
white
rock
over
a
spring
of
water
none
of
the
place
names
in
this
vicinity
fit
in
with
the
accounts
of
uiticos
their
identity
remains
a
puzzle
although
the
symmetry
of
the
buildings
their
architectural
idiosyncrasies
such
as
niches
stone
and
indicate
an
inca
origin
at
what
date
these
towns
and
villages
flourished
who
built
them
why
they
were
deserted
we
do
not
yet
know
and
the
indians
who
live
hereabouts
are
ignorant
or
silent
as
to
their
history
at
torontoy
the
end
of
the
cultivated
temperate
valley
we
found
another
group
of
interesting
ruins
possibly
once
the
residence
of
an
inca
chief
in
a
cave
near
by
we
secured
some
mummies
the
ancient
wrappings

been
consumed
by
the
natives

an
effort
to
smoke
out
the
vampire

that
lived
in

visited
by

of
their

to
ford

spectacled
bears
having
been
seen
here
and
of
damage
having
been
done
by
them
to
some
of
the
higher
crops
led
us
to
go
and
investigate
we
found
no
bears
but
at
an
elevation
of
feet
were
some
very
old
trees
heavily
covered
with
flowering
moss
not
hitherto
known
to

i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
find
a
wild
potato
plant
the
source
from
which
the
early
peruvians
first
developed
many
varieties
of
what
we
incorrectly
call
the
irish

the
tubers
were
as
large
as

here
a

it
turned
out
to

new
to

to
find

an
event
which
delighted

forests
wherever
the
encroaching
precipices
permitted
it
the
land
between
them
and
the
river
was
once
terraced
and
cultivated
we
found
ourselves
unexpectedly
in
a
veritable
wonderland
emotions
came
thick
and
fast
we
marveled
at
the
exquisite
pains
with
which
the
ancient
folk
had
rescued
incredibly
narrow
strips
of
arable
land
from
the
tumbling
rapids
how
could
they
ever
have
managed
to
build
a
retaining
wall
of
heavy
stones
along
the
very
edge
of
the
dangerous
river
which
it
is
death
to
attempt
to
cross
on
one
sightly
bend
near
a
foaming
waterfall
some
inca
chief
built
a
temple
whose
walls
tantalize
the
traveler
he
must
pass
by
within
pistol
shot
of
the
interesting
ruins
unable
to
ford
the
intervening
rapids
high
up

the
ruins
of

this
was
an
ancient
gold

the
incas
half
a
mile
above
us
on
another
steep
slope
some
modern
pioneer
had
recently
cleared
the
jungle
from
a
fine
series
of
ancient
artificial
terraces
on
the
afternoon
of
july
we
reached
a
hut
called
la
maquina
where
travelers
frequently
stop
for
the
night
the
name
comes
from
the
presence
here
of
some
large
iron
wheels
parts
of
a
machine
destined
never
to
overcome
the
difficulties
of
being
transported
all
the
way
to
a
sugar
estate
in
the
lower
valley
and
years
ago
left
here
to
rust
in
the
jungle
there
was
little
fodder
and
there
was
no
good
place
for
us
to
pitch
our
camp
so
we
pushed
on
over
the
very
difficult
road
which
had
been
carved
out
of
the
face
of
a
great
granite
cliff
part
of
the
cliff
had
slid
off
into
the
river
and
the
breach
thus
made
in
the
road
had
been
repaired
by
means
of
a
rustic
bridge
built
on
a
bracket
composed
of
rough
logs
branches
and
reeds
tied
together
and
surmounted
by
a
few
inches
of
earth
and
pebbles
to
make
it
seem
sufficiently
safe
to
the
cautious
cargo
mules
who
picked
their
way
gingerly
across
it
no
wonder
the
machine
rested
where
it
did
and
gave
its
name
to
that
part
of
the
valley
dusk
falls
early
in
this
deep
canyon
the
sides
of
which
are
considerably
over
a
mile
in
height
it
was
almost
dark
when
we
passed
a
little
sandy
plain
two
or
three
acres
in
extent
which
in
this
land
of
steep
mountains
is
called
a
pampa
were
the
dwellers
on
the
pampas
of
argentina
where
a
railroad
can
go
for
miles
in
a
straight
line
except
for
the
curvature
of
the
earth
to
see
this
little
bit
of
called
mandor
pampa
they
would
think
some
one
had
been
joking
or
else
grossly
misusing
a
word
which
means
to
them
illimitable
space
with
not
a
hill
in
sight
however
to
the
ancient
dwellers
in
this
valley
where
level
land
was
so
scarce
that
it
was
worth
while
to
build
high
terraces
so
as
to
enable
two
rows
of
corn
to
grow
where
none
grew
before
any
little
natural
breathing
space
in
the
bottom
of
the
canyon
is
called
a
pampa
figure
the
road
between
maquina
and
mandor
pampa
near
machu
picchu
we
passed
an
hut
turned
off
the
road
through
a
tiny
clearing
and
made
our
camp
at
the
edge
of
the
river
urubamba
on
a
sandy
beach
opposite
us
beyond
the
huge
granite
boulders
which
interfered
with
the
progress
of
the
surging
stream
was
a
steep
mountain
clothed
with
thick
jungle
it
was
an
ideal
spot
for
a
camp
near
the
road
and
yet
secluded
our
actions
however
aroused
the
suspicions
of
the
owner
of
the
hut
melchor
arteaga
who
leases
the
lands
of
mandor
pampa
he
was
anxious
to
know
why
we
did
not
stay
at
his
hut
like
respectable
travelers
our
gendarme
sergeant
carrasco
reassured
him
they
had
quite
a
long
conversation
when
arteaga
learned
that
we
were
interested
in
the
architectural
remains
of
the
incas
he
said
there
were
some
very
good
ruins
in
this
vicinity
in
fact
some
excellent
ones
on
top
of
the
opposite
mountain
called
huayna
picchu
and
also
on
a
ridge
called
machu
picchu
these
were
the
very
places
charles
wiener
heard
of
at
ollantaytambo
in
and
had
been
unable
to
reach
the
story
of
my
experiences
on
the
following
day
will
be
found
in
a
later
chapter
suffice
it
to
say
at
this
point
that
the
ruins
of
huayna
picchu
turned
out
to
be
of
very
little
importance
while
those
of
machu
picchu
familiar
to
readers
of
the
national
geographic
magazine
are
as
interesting
as
any
ever
found
in
the
andes
when
i
first
saw
the
remarkable
citadel
of
machu
picchu
perched
on
a
narrow
ridge
two
thousand
feet
above
the
river
i
wondered
if
it
could
be
the
place
to
which
that
old
soldier
baltasar
de
ocampo
a
member
of
captain
garcia
expedition
was
referring
when
he
said
the
inca
tupac
amaru
was
there
in
the
fortress
of
pitcos
uiticos
which
is
on
a
very
high
mountain
whence
the
view
commanded
a
great
part
of
the
province
of
uilcapampa
here
there
was
an
extensive
level
space
with
very
sumptuous
and
majestic
buildings
erected
with
great
skill
and
art
all
the
lintels
of
the
doors
the
principal
as
well
as
the
ordinary
ones
being
of
marble
elaborately
carved
could
it
be
that
picchu
was
the
modern
variant
of
pitcos
to
be
sure
the
white
granite
of
which
the
temples
and
palaces
of
machu
picchu
are
constructed
might
easily
pass
for
marble
the
difficulty
about
fitting
ocampo
description
to
machu
picchu
however
was
that
there
was
no
difference
between
the
lintels
of
the
doors
and
the
walls
themselves
furthermore
there
is
no
white
rock
over
a
spring
of
water
which
calancha
says
was
near
uiticos
there
is
no
pucyura
in
this
neighborhood
in
fact
the
canyon
of
the
urubamba
does
not
satisfy
the
geographical
requirements
of
uiticos
although
containing
ruins
of
surpassing
interest
machu
picchu
did
not
represent
that
last
inca
capital
for
which
we
were
searching
we
had
not
yet
found
manco

chapter
xi
the
search
continued
machu
picchu
is
on
the
between
the
temperate
zone
and
the
tropics
camping
near
the
bridge
of
san
miguel
below
the
ruins
both
heller
and
cook
found
interesting
evidences
of
this
fact
in
the
flora
and
fauna
from
the
point
of
view
of
historical
geography
cook
most
important
discovery
was
the
presence
here
of
huilca
a
tree
which
does
not
grow
in
cold
climates
the
quichua
dictionaries
tell
us
huilca
is
a
medicine
a
purgative
an
infusion
made
from
the
seeds
of
the
tree
is
used
as
an
enema
i
am
indebted
to
cook
for
calling
my
attention
to
two
articles
by
safford
in
which
it
is
also
shown
that
from
seeds
of
the
huilca
a
powder
is
prepared
sometimes
called
cohoba
this
powder
says
safford
is
a
narcotic
snuff
inhaled
through
the
nostrils
by
means
of
a
bifurcated
tube
all
writers
unite
in
declaring
that
it
induced
a
kind
of
intoxication
or
hypnotic
state
accompanied
by
visions
which
were
regarded
by
the
natives
as
supernatural
while
under
its
influence
the
necromancers
or
priests
were
supposed
to
hold
communication
with
unseen
powers
and
their
incoherent
mutterings
were
regarded
as
prophecies
or
revelations
of
hidden
things
in
treating
the
sick
the
physicians
made
use
of
it
to
discover
the
cause
of
the
malady
or
the
person
or
spirit
by
whom
the
patient
was
bewitched
safford
quotes
las
casas
as
saying
it
was
an
interesting
spectacle
to
witness
how
they
took
it
and
what
they
spake
the
chief
began
the
ceremony
and
while
he
was
engaged
all
remained
silent
when
he
had
snuffed
up
the
powder
through
his
nostrils
he
remained
silent
for
a
while
with
his
head
inclined
to
one
side
and
his
arms
placed
on
his
knees
then
he
raised
his
face
heavenward
uttering
certain
words
which
must
have
been
his
prayer
to
the
true
god
or
to
him
whom
he
held
as
god
after
which
all
responded
almost
as
we
do
when
we
say
amen
and
this
they
did
with
a
loud
voice
or
sound
then
they
gave
thanks
and
said
to
him
certain
complimentary
things
entreating
his
benevolence
and
begging
him
to
reveal
to
them
what
he
had
seen
he
described
to
them
his
vision
saying
that
the
cemi
spirits
had
spoken
to
him
and
had
predicted
good
times
or
the
contrary
or
that
children
were
to
be
born
or
to
die
or
that
there
was
to
be
some
dispute
with
their
neighbors
and
other
things
which
might
come
to
his
imagination
all
disturbed
with
that
intoxication
clearly
from
the
point
of
view
of
priests
and
soothsayers
the
place
where
huilca
was
first
found
and
used
in
their
incantations
would
be
important
it
is
not
strange
to
find
therefore
that
the
inca
name
of
this
river
was
the
huilca
river
the
pampa
on
this
river
where
the
trees
grew
would
likely
receive
the
name
uilca
pampa
if
it
became
an
important
city
then
the
surrounding
region
might
be
named
uilcapampa
after
it
this
seems
to
me
to
be
the
most
probable
origin
of
the
name
of
the
province
anyhow
it
is
worth
noting
the
fact
that
denizens
of
cuzco
and
ollantaytambo
coming
down
the
river
in
search
of
this
highly
prized
narcotic
must
have
found
the
first
trees
not
far
from
machu
picchu
leaving
the
ruins
of
machu
picchu
for
later
investigation
we
now
pushed
on
down
the
urubamba
valley
crossed
the
bridge
of
san
miguel
passed
the
house
of
señor
lizarraga
first
of
modern
peruvians
to
write
his
name
on
the
granite
walls
of
machu
picchu
and
came
to
the
fields
of
huadquiña
we
had
now
left
the
temperate
zone
and
entered
the
tropics
at
huadquiña
we
were
so
fortunate
as
to
find
that
the
proprietress
of
the
plantation
señora
carmen
vargas
and
her
children
were
spending
the
season
here
during
the
rainy
winter
months
they
live
in
cuzco
but
when
summer
brings
fine
weather
they
come
to
huadquiña
to
enjoy
the
life
of
the
country
they
made
us
welcome
not
only
with
that
hospitality
to
passing
travelers
which
is
common
to
sugar
estates
all
over
the
world
but
gave
us
real
assistance
in
our
explorations
señora
carmen
estate
covers
more
than
two
hundred
square
miles
huadquiña
is
a
splendid
example
of
the
ancient
patriarchal
system
the
indians
who
come
from
other
parts
of
peru
to
work
on
the
plantation
enjoy
perquisites
and
wages
unknown
elsewhere
those
whose
home
is
on
the
estate
regard
señora
carmen
with
an
affectionate
reverence
which
she
well
deserves
all
are
welcome
to
bring
her
their
troubles
the
system
goes
back
to
the
days
when
the
spiritual
moral
and
material
welfare
of
the
indians
was
entrusted
in
encomienda
to
the
lords
of
the
repartimiento
or
allotted
territory
huadquiña
once
belonged
to
the
jesuits
they
planted
the
first
sugar
cane
and
established
the
mill
after
their
expulsion
from
the
spanish
colonies
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
huadquiña
was
bought
by
a
peruvian
it
was
first
described
in
geographical
literature
by
the
count
de
sartiges
who
stayed
here
for
several
weeks
in
when
on
his
way
to
choqquequirau
he
says
that
the
owner
of
huadquiña
is
perhaps
the
only
landed
proprietor
in
the
entire
world
who
possesses
on
his
estates
all
the
products
of
the
four
parts
of
the
globe
in
the
different
regions
of
his
domain
he
has
wool
hides
horsehair
potatoes
wheat
corn
sugar
coffee
chocolate
coca
many
mines
of
lead
and
placers
of
gold
truly
a
royal
principality
figure
huadquiña
incidentally
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
although
sartiges
was
an
enthusiastic
explorer
eager
to
visit
undescribed
inca
ruins
he
makes
no
mention
whatever
of
machu
picchu
yet
from
huadquiña
one
can
reach
machu
picchu
on
foot
in
half
a
day
without
crossing
the
urubamba
river
apparently
the
ruins
were
unknown
to
his
hosts
in
they
were
equally
unknown
to
our
kind
hosts
in
they
scarcely
believed
the
story
i
told
them
of
the
beauty
and
extent
of
the
inca
edifices
when
my
photographs
were
developed
however
and
they
saw
with
their
own
eyes
the
marvelous
stonework
of
the
principal
temples
señora
carmen
and
her
family
were
struck
dumb
with
wonder
and
astonishment
they
could
not
understand
how
it
was
possible
that
they
should
have
passed
so
close
to
machu
picchu
every
year
of
their
lives
since
the
river
road
was
opened
without
knowing
what
was
there
they
had
seen
a
single
little
building
on
the
crest
of
the
ridge
but
supposed
that
it
was
an
isolated
tower
of
no
great
interest
or
importance
their
neighbor
lizarraga
near
the
bridge
of
san
miguel
had
reported
the
presence
of
the
ruins
which
he
first
visited
in
but
like
our
friends
in
cuzco
they
had
paid
little
attention
to
his
stories
we
were
soon
to
have
a
demonstration
of
the
causes
of
such
skepticism
our
new
friends
read
with
interest
my
copy
of
those
paragraphs
of
calaucha
chronicle
which
referred
to
the
location
of
the
last
inca
capital
learning
that
we
were
anxious
to
discover
uiticos
a
place
of
which
they
had
never
heard
they
ordered
the
most
intelligent
tenants
on
the
estate
to
come
in
and
be
questioned
the
best
informed
of
all
was
a
sturdy
mestizo
a
trusted
foreman
who
said
that
in
a
little
valley
called
ccllumayu
a
few
hours
journey
down
the
urubamba
there
were
important
ruins
which
had
been
seen
by
some
of
señora
indians
even
more
interesting
and
thrilling
was
his
statement
that
on
a
ridge
up
the
salcantay
valley
was
a
place
called
yurak
rumi
yurak
white
rumi
stone
where
some
very
interesting
ruins
had
been
found
by
his
workmen
when
cutting
trees
for
firewood
we
all
became
excited
over
this
for
among
the
paragraphs
which
i
had
copied
from
calancha
chronicle
was
the
statement
that
close
to
uiticos
is
the
white
stone
of
the
aforesaid
house
of
the
sun
which
is
called
yurak
rumi
our
hosts
assured
us
that
this
must
be
the
place
since
no
one
hereabouts
had
ever
heard
of
any
other
yurak
rumi
the
foreman
on
being
closely
questioned
said
that
he
had
seen
the
ruins
once
or
twice
that
he
had
also
been
up
the
urubamba
valley
and
seen
the
great
ruins
at
ollantaytambo
and
that
those
which
he
had
seen
at
yurak
rumi
were
as
good
as
those
at
ollantaytambo
here
was
a
definite
statement
made
by
an
eyewitness
apparently
we
were
about
to
see
that
interesting
rock
where
the
last
incas
worshiped
however
the
foreman
said
that
the
trail
thither
was
at
present
impassable
although
a
small
gang
of
indians
could
open
it
in
less
than
a
week
our
hosts
excited
by
the
pictures
we
had
shown
them
of
machu
picchu
and
now
believing
that
even
finer
ruins
might
be
found
on
their
own
property
immediately
gave
orders
to
have
the
path
to
yurak
rumi
cleared
for
our
benefit
while
this
was
being
done
señora
carmen
son
the
manager
of
the
plantation
offered
to
accompany
us
himself
to
ccllumayu
where
other
important
ruins
had
been
found
which
could
be
reached
in
a
few
hours
without
cutting
any
new
trails
acting
on
his
assurance
that
we
should
not
need
tent
or
cots
we
left
our
camping
outfit
behind
and
followed
him
to
a
small
valley
on
the
south
side
of
the
urubamba
we
found
ccllumayu
to
consist
of
two
huts
in
a
small
clearing
densely
wooded
slopes
rose
on
all
sides
the
manager
requested
two
of
the
indian
tenants
to
act
as
guides
with
them
we
plunged
into
the
thick
jungle
and
spent
a
long
and
fatiguing
day
searching
in
vain
for
ruins
that
night
the
manager
returned
to
huadquiña
but
professor
foote
and
i
preferred
to
remain
in
ccllumayu
and
prosecute
a
more
vigorous
search
on
the
next
day
we
shared
a
little
thatched
hut
with
our
indian
hosts
and
a
score
of
fat
cuys
guinea
pigs
the
chief
source
of
the
ccllumayu
meat
supply
the
hut
was
built
of
rough
wattles
which
admitted
plenty
of
fresh
air
and
gave
us
comfortable
ventilation
primitive
little
also
of
wattles
constructed
for
the
needs
of
short
stocky
indians
kept
us
from
being
overrun
by
inquisitive
cuys
but
could
hardly
be
called
as
comfortable
as
our
own
folding
cots
which
we
had
left
at
huadquiña
the
next
day
our
guides
were
able
to
point
out
in
the
woods
a
few
piles
of
stones
the
foundations
of
oval
or
circular
huts
which
probably
were
built
by
some
primitive
savage
tribe
in
prehistoric
times
nothing
further
could
be
found
here
of
ruins
important
or
otherwise
although
we
spent
three
days
at
ccllumayu
such
was
our
first
disillusionment
on
our
return
to
huadquiña
we
learned
that
the
trail
to
yurak
rumi
would
be
ready
in
a
day
or
two
in
the
meantime
our
hosts
became
much
interested
in
professor
foote
collection
of
insects
they
brought
an
unnamed
scorpion
and
informed
us
that
an
orange
orchard
surrounded
by
high
walls
in
a
secluded
place
back
of
the
house
was
a
great
place
for
spiders
we
found
that
their
statement
was
not
exaggerated
and
immediately
engaged
in
an
enthusiastic
spider
hunt
when
these
huadquiña
spiders
were
studied
at
the
harvard
museum
of
comparative
zoölogy
chamberlain
found
among
them
the
representatives
of
four
new
genera
and
nineteen
species
hitherto
unknown
to
science
as
a
reward
of
merit
he
gave
professor
foote
name
to
the
scorpion
figure
ruins
of
yurak
rumi
near
huadquiña
probably
an
inca
storehouse
well
ventilated
and
well
drained
drawn
by
bumstead
from
measurements
and
photographs
by
hiram
bingham
and
foote
finally
the
trail
to
yurak
rumi
was
reported
finished
it
was
with
feelings
of
keen
anticipation
that
i
started
out
with
the
foreman
to
see
those
ruins
which
he
had
just
revisited
and
now
declared
were
better
than
those
of
ollantaytambo
it
was
to
be
presumed
that
in
the
pride
of
discovery
he
might
have
exaggerated
their
importance
still
it
never
entered
my
head
what
i
was
actually
to
find
after
several
hours
spent
in
clearing
away
the
dense
forest
growth
which
surrounded
the
walls
i
learned
that
this
yurak
rumi
consisted
of
the
ruins
of
a
single
little
rectangular
inca
storehouse
no
effort
had
been
made
at
beauty
of
construction
the
walls
were
of
rough
unfashioned
stones
laid
in
clay
the
building
was
without
a
doorway
although
it
had
several
small
windows
and
a
series
of
ventilating
shafts
under
the
house
the
lintels
of
the
windows
and
of
the
small
apertures
leading
into
the
subterranean
shafts
were
of
stone
there
were
no
windows
on
the
sunny
north
side
or
on
the
ends
but
there
were
four
on
the
south
side
through
which
it
would
have
been
possible
to
secure
access
to
the
stores
of
maize
potatoes
or
other
provisions
placed
here
for
it
will
be
recalled
that
the
incas
maintained
an
extensive
system
of
public
storehouses
not
only
in
the
centers
of
population
but
also
at
strategic
points
on
the
principal
trails
yurak
rumi
is
on
top
of
the
ridge
between
the
salcantay
and
huadquiña
valleys
probably
on
an
ancient
road
which
crossed
the
province
of
uilcapampa
as
such
it
was
interesting
but
to
compare
it
with
ollantaytambo
as
the
foreman
had
done
was
to
liken
a
cottage
to
a
palace
or
a
mouse
to
an
elephant
it
seems
incredible
that
anybody
having
actually
seen
both
places
could
have
thought
for
a
moment
that
one
was
as
good
as
the
other
to
be
sure
the
foreman
was
not
a
trained
observer
and
his
interest
in
inca
buildings
was
probably
of
the
slightest
yet
the
ruins
of
ollantaytambo
are
so
well
known
and
so
impressive
that
even
the
most
casual
traveler
is
struck
by
them
and
the
natives
themselves
are
enormously
proud
of
them
the
real
cause
of
the
foreman
inaccuracy
was
probably
his
desire
to
please
to
give
an
answer
which
will
satisfy
the
questioner
is
a
common
trait
in
peru
as
well
as
in
many
other
parts
of
the
world
anyhow
the
lessons
of
the
past
few
days
were
not
lost
on
us
we
now
understood
the
skepticism
which
had
prevailed
regarding
lizarraga
discoveries
it
is
small
wonder
that
the
occasional
stories
about
machu
picchu
which
had
drifted
into
cuzco
had
never
elicited
any
enthusiasm
nor
even
provoked
investigation
on
the
part
of
those
professors
and
students
in
the
university
of
cuzco
who
were
interested
in
visiting
the
remains
of
inca
civilization
they
knew
only
too
well
the
fondness
of
their
countrymen
for
exaggeration
and
their
inability
to
report
facts
accurately
obviously
we
had
not
yet
found
uiticos
so
bidding
farewell
to
señora
carmen
we
crossed
the
urubamba
on
the
bridge
of
colpani
and
proceeded
down
the
valley
past
the
mouth
of
the
lucumayo
and
the
road
from
panticalla
to
the
hamlet
of
chauillay
where
the
urubamba
is
joined
by
the
vilcabamba
river
both
rivers
are
restricted
here
to
narrow
gorges
through
which
their
waters
rush
and
roar
on
their
way
to
the
lower
valley
a
few
rods
from
chauillay
was
a
fine
bridge
the
natives
call
it
chuquichaca
steel
and
iron
have
superseded
the
old
suspension
bridge
of
huge
cables
made
of
vegetable
fiber
with
its
narrow
roadway
of
wattles
supported
by
a
network
of
vines
yet
here
it
was
that
in
the
military
force
sent
by
the
viceroy
francisco
de
toledo
under
the
command
of
general
martin
hurtado
and
captain
garcia
found
the
forces
of
the
young
inca
drawn
up
to
defend
uiticos
it
will
be
remembered
that
after
a
brief
preliminary
fire
the
forces
of
tupac
amaru
were
routed
without
having
destroyed
the
bridge
and
thus
captain
garcia
was
enabled
to
accomplish
that
which
had
proved
too
much
for
the
famous
gonzalo
pizarro
our
inspection
of
the
surroundings
showed
that
captain
garcia
companion
baltasar
de
ocampo
was
correct
when
he
said
that
the
occupation
of
the
bridge
of
chuquichaca
was
a
measure
of
no
small
importance
for
the
royal
force
it
certainly
would
have
caused
the
spaniards
great
trouble
if
they
had
had
to
rebuild
it
we
might
now
have
proceeded
to
follow
garcia
tracks
up
the
vilcabamba
had
we
not
been
anxious
to
see
the
proprietor
of
the
plantation
of
santa
ana
don
pedro
duque
reputed
to
be
the
wisest
and
ablest
man
in
this
whole
province
we
felt
he
would
be
able
to
offer
us
advice
of
prime
importance
in
our
search
so
leaving
the
bridge
of
chuquichaca
we
continued
down
the
urubamba
river
which
here
meanders
through
a
broad
fertile
valley
green
with
tropical
plantations
we
passed
groves
of
bananas
and
oranges
waving
fields
of
green
sugar
cane
the
hospitable
dwellings
of
prosperous
planters
and
the
huts
of
indians
fortunate
enough
to
dwell
in
this
tropical
garden
of
eden
the
day
was
hot
and
so
i
stopped
near
some
large
orange
trees
loaded
with
ripe
fruit
and
asked
the
indian
proprietress
to
sell
me
ten
cents
worth
in
exchange
for
the
tiny
silver
real
she
dragged
out
a
sack
containing
more
than
fifty
oranges
i
was
fain
to
request
her
to
permit
us
to
take
only
as
many
as
our
pockets
could
hold
but
she
seemed
so
surprised
and
pained
we
had
to
fill
our
as
well
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
crossed
the
urubamba
river
on
a
fine
steel
bridge
and
found
ourselves
in
the
prosperous
little
town
of
quillabamba
the
provincial
capital
its
main
street
was
lined
with
shops
evidence
of
the
fact
that
this
is
one
of
the
principal
gateways
to
the
peruvian
rubber
country
which
with
the
high
price
of
rubber
then
prevailing
was
the
scene
of
unusual
activity
passing
through
quillabamba
and
up
a
slight
hill
beyond
it
we
came
to
the
long
colonnades
of
the
celebrated
sugar
estate
of
santa
ana
founded
by
the
jesuits
where
all
explorers
who
have
passed
this
way
since
the
days
of
charles
wiener
have
been
entertained
he
says
that
he
was
received
here
with
a
thousand
signs
of
friendship
mille
témoignages
we
were
received
the
same
way
even
in
a
region
where
we
had
repeatedly
received
valuable
assistance
from
government
officials
and
generous
hospitality
from
private
individuals
our
reception
at
santa
ana
stands
out
as
particularly
delightful
don
pedro
duque
took
great
interest
in
enabling
us
to
get
all
possible
information
about
the
region
into
which
we
proposed
to
penetrate
born
in
colombia
but
long
resident
in
peru
he
was
a
gentleman
of
the
old
school
keenly
interested
not
only
in
the
administration
and
economic
progress
of
his
plantation
but
also
in
the
intellectual
movements
of
the
outside
world
he
entered
with
zest
into
our
studies
the
name
uiticos
was
new
to
him
but
after
reading
over
with
us
our
extracts
from
the
spanish
chronicles
he
was
sure
that
he
could
help
us
find
it
and
help
us
he
did
santa
ana
is
less
than
thirteen
degrees
south
of
the
equator
the
elevation
is
barely
feet
the
winter
nights
are
cool
but
the
heat
in
the
middle
of
the
day
is
intense
nevertheless
our
host
was
so
energetic
that
as
a
result
of
his
efforts
a
number
of
the
residents
were
brought
to
the
conferences
at
the
great
plantation
house
they
told
all
they
knew
of
the
towns
and
valleys
where
the
last
four
incas
had
found
a
refuge
but
that
was
not
much
they
all
agreed
that
if
only
señor
lopez
torres
were
alive
he
could
have
been
of
great
service
to
us
as
he
had
prospected
for
mines
and
rubber
in
those
parts
more
than
any
one
else
and
had
once
seen
some
inca
ruins
in
the
forest
of
uiticos
and
chuquipalpa
and
most
of
the
places
mentioned
in
the
chronicles
none
of
don
pedro
friends
had
ever
heard
it
was
all
rather
discouraging
until
one
day
by
the
greatest
good
fortune
there
arrived
at
santa
ana
another
friend
of
don
pedro
the
teniente
gobernador
of
the
village
of
lucma
in
the
valley
of
vilcabamba
a
crusty
old
fellow
named
evaristo
mogrovejo
his
brother
pio
mogrovejo
had
been
a
member
of
the
party
of
energetic
peruvians
who
in
had
searched
for
buried
treasure
at
choqquequirau
and
had
left
their
names
on
its
walls
evaristo
mogrovejo
could
understand
searching
for
buried
treasure
but
he
was
totally
unable
otherwise
to
comprehend
our
desire
to
find
the
ruins
of
the
places
mentioned
by
father
calancha
and
the
contemporaries
of
captain
garcia
had
we
first
met
mogrovejo
in
lucma
he
would
undoubtedly
have
received
us
with
suspicion
and
done
nothing
to
further
our
quest
fortunately
for
us
his
official
superior
was
the
of
the
province
of
convención
lived
at
quillabamba
near
santa
ana
and
was
a
friend
of
don
pedro
the
had
received
orders
from
his
own
official
superior
the
prefect
of
cuzco
to
take
a
personal
interest
in
our
undertaking
and
accordingly
gave
particular
orders
to
mogrovejo
to
see
to
it
that
we
were
given
every
facility
for
finding
the
ancient
ruins
and
identifying
the
places
of
historic
interest
although
mogrovejo
declined
to
risk
his
skin
in
the
savage
wilderness
of
conservidayoc
he
carried
out
his
orders
faithfully
and
was
ultimately
of
great
assistance
to
us
extremely
gratified
with
the
result
of
our
conferences
in
santa
ana
yet
reluctant
to
leave
the
delightful
hospitality
and
charming
conversation
of
our
gracious
host
we
decided
to
go
at
once
to
lucma
taking
the
road
on
the
southwest
side
of
the
urubamba
and
using
the
route
followed
by
the
pack
animals
which
carry
the
precious
cargoes
of
coca
and
aguardiente
from
santa
ana
to
ollantaytambo
and
cuzco
thanks
to
don
pedro
energy
we
made
an
excellent
start
not
one
of
those
but
really
departures
so
customary
in
the
andes
we
passed
through
a
region
which
originally
had
been
heavily
forested
had
long
since
been
cleared
and
was
now
covered
with
bushes
and
second
growth
near
the
roadside
i
noticed
a
considerable
number
of
land
shells
grouped
on
the
of
overhanging
rocks
as
a
boy
in
the
hawaiian
islands
i
had
spent
too
many
saturdays
collecting
those
beautiful
and
fascinating
mollusks
which
usually
prefer
the
trees
of
upland
valleys
to
enable
me
to
resist
the
temptation
of
gathering
a
large
number
of
such
as
could
easily
be
secured
none
of
the
snails
were
moving
the
dry
season
appears
to
be
their
resting
period
some
weeks
later
professor
foote
and
i
passed
through
maras
and
were
interested
to
notice
thousands
of
land
shells
mostly
white
in
color
on
small
bushes
where
they
seemed
to
be
quietly
sleeping
they
were
fairly
glued
to
their
resting
places
clustered
so
closely
in
some
cases
as
to
give
the
stems
of
the
bushes
a
ghostly
appearance
our
present
objective
was
the
valley
of
the
river
vilcabamba
so
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
learn
only
one
other
explorer
had
preceded
us
the
distinguished
scientist
raimondi
his
map
of
the
vilcabamba
is
fairly
accurate
he
reports
the
presence
here
of
mines
and
minerals
but
with
the
exception
of
an
abandoned
tampu
at
maracnyoc
the
place
which
possesses
a
millstone
he
makes
no
mention
of
any
ruins
accordingly
although
it
seemed
from
the
story
of
baltasar
de
ocampo
and
captain
garcia
other
contemporaries
that
we
were
now
entering
the
valley
of
uiticos
it
was
with
of
considerable
uncertainty
that
we
proceeded
on
our
quest
it
may
seem
strange
that
we
should
have
been
in
any
doubt
yet
before
our
visit
nearly
all
the
peruvian
historians
and
geographers
except
don
carlos
romero
still
believed
that
when
the
inca
manco
fled
from
pizarro
he
took
up
his
residence
at
choqquequirau
in
the
apurimac
valley
the
word
choqquequirau
means
cradle
of
gold
and
this
lent
color
to
the
legend
that
manco
had
carried
off
with
him
from
cuzco
great
quantities
of
gold
utensils
and
much
treasure
which
he
deposited
in
his
new
capital
raimondi
knowing
that
manco
had
retired
to
uilcapampa
visited
both
the
present
villages
of
vilcabamba
and
pucyura
and
saw
nothing
of
any
ruins
he
was
satisfied
that
choqquequirau
was
manco
refuge
because
it
was
far
enough
from
pucyura
to
answer
the
requirements
of
calancha
that
it
was
two
or
three
days
journey
from
uilcapampa
to
puquiura
a
new
road
had
recently
been
built
along
the
river
bank
by
the
owner
of
the
sugar
estate
at
paltaybamba
to
enable
his
pack
animals
to
travel
more
rapidly
much
of
it
had
to
be
carved
out
of
the
face
of
a
solid
rock
precipice
and
in
places
it
pierces
the
cliffs
in
a
series
of
little
tunnels
my
gendarme
missed
this
road
and
took
the
steep
old
trail
over
the
cliffs
as
ocampo
said
in
his
story
of
captain
garcia
expedition
the
road
was
narrow
in
the
ascent
with
forest
on
the
fight
and
on
the
left
a
ravine
of
great
depth
we
reached
paltaybamba
about
dusk
the
owner
señor
josé
pancorbo
was
absent
attending
to
the
affairs
of
a
rubber
estate
in
the
jungles
of
the
river
san
miguel
the
plantation
of
paltaybamba
occupies
the
best
lands
in
the
lower
vilcabamba
valley
but
lying
as
it
does
well
off
the
main
highway
visitors
are
rare
and
our
arrival
was
the
occasion
for
considerable
excitement
we
were
not
unexpected
however
it
was
señor
pancorbo
who
had
assured
us
in
cuzco
that
we
should
find
ruins
near
pucyura
and
he
had
told
his
to
be
on
the
for
us
we
had
a
long
talk
with
the
manager
of
the
plantation
and
his
friends
that
evening
they
had
heard
little
of
any
ruins
in
this
vicinity
but
repeated
one
of
the
stories
we
had
heard
in
santa
ana
that
way
off
somewhere
in
the
montaña
there
was
an
inca
city
all
agreed
that
it
was
a
very
difficult
place
to
reach
and
none
of
them
had
ever
been
there
in
the
morning
the
manager
gave
us
a
guide
to
the
next
house
up
the
valley
with
orders
that
the
man
at
that
house
should
relay
us
to
the
next
and
so
on
these
people
all
tenants
of
the
plantation
obligingly
carried
out
their
orders
although
at
considerable
inconvenience
to
themselves
the
vilcabamba
valley
above
paltaybamba
is
very
picturesque
there
are
high
mountains
on
either
side
covered
with
dense
jungle
and
dark
green
foliage
in
pleasing
contrast
to
the
light
green
of
the
fields
of
waving
sugar
cane
the
valley
is
steep
the
road
is
very
winding
and
the
torrent
of
the
vilcabamba
roars
loudly
even
in
july
what
it
must
be
like
in
february
the
rainy
season
we
could
only
surmise
about
two
leagues
above
paltaybamba
at
or
near
the
spot
called
by
raimondi
maracnyoc
an
abandoned
tampu
we
came
to
some
old
stone
walls
the
ruins
of
a
place
now
called
huayara
or
hoyara
i
believe
them
to
be
the
ruins
of
the
first
spanish
settlement
in
this
region
a
place
referred
to
by
ocampo
who
says
that
the
fugitives
of
tupac
army
were
brought
back
to
the
valley
of
hoyara
where
they
were
settled
in
a
large
village
and
a
city
of
spaniards
was
founded
this
city
was
founded
on
an
extensive
plain
near
a
river
with
an
admirable
climate
from
the
river
channels
of
water
were
taken
for
the
service
of
the
city
the
water
being
very
good
the
water
here
is
excellent
far
better
than
any
in
the
cuzco
basin
on
the
plain
near
the
river
are
some
of
the
last
cane
fields
of
the
plantation
of
paltaybamba
hoyara
was
abandoned
after
the
discovery
of
gold
mines
several
leagues
farther
up
the
valley
and
the
spanish
city
was
moved
to
the
village
now
called
vilcabamba
our
next
stop
was
at
lucma
the
home
of
teniente
gobernador
mogrovejo
the
village
of
lucma
is
an
irregular
cluster
of
about
thirty
huts
it
enjoys
a
moderate
amount
of
prosperity
due
to
the
fact
of
its
being
located
near
one
of
the
gateways
to
the
interior
the
pass
to
the
rubber
estates
in
the
san
miguel
valley
here
are
houses
of
refreshment
and
two
shops
the
only
ones
in
the
region
one
can
buy
cotton
cloth
sugar
canned
goods
and
candles
a
picturesque
belfry
and
a
small
church
old
and
somewhat
out
of
repair
crown
the
small
hill
back
of
the
village
there
is
little
level
land
but
the
slopes
are
gentle
and
permit
a
considerable
amount
of
agriculture
there
was
no
evidence
of
extensive
terracing
maize
and
alfalfa
seemed
to
be
the
principal
crops
evaristo
mogrovejo
lived
on
the
little
plaza
around
which
the
houses
of
the
more
important
people
were
grouped
he
had
just
returned
from
santa
ana
by
the
way
of
idma
using
a
much
worse
trail
than
that
over
which
we
had
come
but
one
which
enabled
him
to
avoid
passing
through
paltaybamba
with
whose
proprietor
he
was
not
on
good
terms
he
told
us
stories
of
misadventures
which
had
happened
to
travelers
at
the
gates
of
paltaybamba
stories
highly
reminiscent
of
feudal
days
in
europe
when
provincial
barons
were
accustomed
to
lay
tribute
on
all
who
passed
we
offered
to
pay
mogrovejo
a
gratificación
of
a
sol
or
peruvian
silver
dollar
for
every
ruin
to
which
he
would
take
us
and
double
that
amount
if
the
locality
should
prove
to
contain
particularly
interesting
ruins
this
aroused
all
his
business
instincts
he
summoned
his
alcaldes
and
other
indians
to
appear
and
be
interviewed
they
told
us
there
were
many
ruins
hereabouts
being
a
practical
man
himself
mogrovejo
had
never
taken
any
interest
in
ruins
now
he
saw
the
chance
not
only
to
make
money
out
of
the
ancient
sites
but
also
to
gain
official
favor
by
carrying
out
with
unexampled
vigor
the
orders
of
his
superior
the
of
quillabamba
so
he
exerted
himself
to
the
utmost
in
our
behalf
the
next
day
we
were
guided
up
a
ravine
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
back
of
lucma
this
ridge
divides
the
upper
from
the
lower
vilcabamba
on
all
sides
the
hills
rose
several
thousand
feet
above
us
in
places
they
were
covered
with
forest
growth
chiefly
above
the
cloud
line
where
daily
moisture
encourages
vegetation
in
some
of
the
forests
on
the
more
gentle
slopes
recent
clearings
gave
evidence
of
enterprise
on
the
part
of
the
present
inhabitants
of
the
valley
after
an
climb
we
reached
what
were
unquestionably
the
ruins
of
inca
structures
on
an
artificial
terrace
which
commands
a
magnificent
view
far
down
toward
paltaybamba
and
the
bridge
of
chuquichaca
as
well
as
in
the
opposite
direction
the
contemporaries
of
captain
garcia
speak
of
a
number
of
forts
or
pucarás
which
had
to
be
stormed
and
captured
before
tupac
amaru
could
be
taken
prisoner
this
was
probably
one
of
those
fortresses
its
strategic
position
and
the
ease
with
which
it
could
be
defended
point
to
such
an
interpretation
nevertheless
this
ruin
did
not
fit
the
fortress
of
pitcos
nor
the
house
of
the
sun
near
the
white
rock
over
the
spring
it
is
called
incahuaracana
the
place
where
the
inca
shoots
with
a
sling
incahuaracana
consists
of
two
typical
inca
edifices
one
of
two
rooms
about
by
feet
and
the
other
very
long
and
narrow
by
feet
the
walls
of
unhewn
stone
laid
in
clay
were
not
particularly
well
built
and
resemble
in
many
respects
the
ruins
at
choqquequirau
the
rooms
of
the
principal
house
are
without
windows
although
each
has
three
front
doors
and
is
lined
with
niches
four
or
five
on
a
side
the
long
narrow
building
was
divided
into
three
rooms
and
had
several
front
doors
a
force
of
two
hundred
indian
soldiers
could
have
slept
in
these
houses
without
unusual
crowding
we
left
lucma
the
next
day
forded
the
vilcabamba
river
and
soon
had
an
uninterrupted
view
up
the
valley
to
a
high
truncated
hill
its
top
partly
covered
with
a
scrubby
growth
of
trees
and
bushes
its
sides
steep
and
rocky
we
were
told
that
the
name
of
the
hill
was
rosaspata
a
word
of
modern
hybrid
origin
pata
being
quichua
for
hill
while
rosas
is
the
spanish
word
for
roses
mogrovejo
said
his
indians
told
him
that
on
the
hill
of
roses
there
were
more
ruins
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
across
the
river
is
the
village
of
pucyura
when
raimondi
was
here
in
it
was
but
a
wretched
hamlet
with
a
paltry
chapel
it
is
more
prosperous
there
is
a
large
public
school
here
to
which
children
come
from
villages
many
miles
away
so
crowded
is
the
school
that
in
fine
weather
the
children
sit
on
benches
out
of
doors
the
boys
all
go
barefooted
the
girls
wear
high
boots
i
once
saw
them
reciting
a
geography
lesson
but
i
doubt
if
even
the
teacher
knew
whether
or
not
this
was
the
site
of
the
first
school
in
this
whole
region
for
it
was
to
puquiura
that
friar
marcos
came
in
perhaps
he
built
the
mezquina
capilla
which
raimondi
scorned
if
this
were
the
puquiura
of
friar
marcos
then
uiticos
must
be
near
by
for
he
and
friar
diego
walked
with
their
famous
procession
of
converts
from
puquiura
to
the
house
of
the
sun
and
the
white
rock
which
was
close
to
uiticos
crossing
the
vilcabamba
on
a
footbridge
that
afternoon
we
came
immediately
upon
some
old
ruins
that
were
not
incaic
examination
showed
that
they
were
apparently
the
remains
of
a
very
crude
spanish
crushing
mill
obviously
intended
to
pulverize
quartz
on
a
considerable
scale
perhaps
this
was
the
place
referred
to
by
ocampo
who
says
that
the
inca
titu
cusi
attended
masses
said
by
his
friend
friar
diego
in
a
chapel
which
is
near
my
houses
and
on
my
own
lands
in
the
mining
district
of
puquiura
close
to
the
mill
of
don
christoval
de
albornoz
precentor
that
was
of
the
cuzco
cathedral
figure
pucyura
and
the
hill
of
rosaspata
in
the
vilcabamba
valley
one
of
the
millstones
is
five
feet
in
diameter
and
more
than
a
foot
thick
it
lay
near
a
huge
flat
rock
of
white
granite
hollowed
out
so
as
to
enable
the
millstone
to
be
rolled
slowly
around
in
a
hollow
trough
there
was
also
a
very
large
indian
mortar
and
pestle
heavy
enough
to
need
the
services
of
four
men
to
work
it
the
mortar
was
merely
the
top
of
a
large
boulder
which
projected
a
few
inches
above
the
surface
of
the
ground
the
pestle
four
feet
in
diameter
was
of
the
characteristic
shape
used
from
time
immemorial
by
the
indians
of
the
highlands
for
crushing
maize
or
potatoes
since
no
other
ruins
of
a
spanish
plant
have
been
found
in
this
vicinity
it
is
probable
that
this
once
belonged
to
don
christoval
de
albornoz
near
the
mill
the
tincochaca
river
joins
the
vilcabamba
from
the
southeast
crossing
this
on
a
footbridge
i
followed
mogrovejo
to
an
old
and
very
dilapidated
structure
in
the
saddle
of
the
hill
on
the
south
side
of
rosaspata
they
called
the
place
uncapampa
or
inca
pampa
it
is
probably
one
of
the
forts
stormed
by
captain
garcia
and
his
men
in
the
ruins
represent
a
single
house
feet
long
by
feet
wide
if
the
house
had
partitions
they
long
since
disappeared
there
were
six
doorways
in
front
none
on
the
ends
or
in
the
rear
walls
the
ruins
resembled
those
of
incahuaracana
near
lucma
the
walls
had
originally
been
built
of
rough
stones
laid
in
clay
the
general
finish
was
extremely
rough
the
few
niches
all
at
one
end
of
the
structure
were
irregular
about
two
feet
in
width
and
a
little
more
than
this
in
height
the
one
corner
of
the
building
which
was
still
standing
had
a
height
of
about
ten
feet
two
hundred
inca
soldiers
could
have
slept
here
also
leaving
uncapampa
and
following
my
guides
i
climbed
up
the
ridge
and
followed
a
path
along
its
west
side
to
the
top
of
rosaspata
passing
some
ruins
much
overgrown
and
of
a
primitive
character
i
soon
found
myself
on
a
pleasant
pampa
near
the
top
of
the
mountain
the
view
from
here
commands
a
great
part
of
the
province
of
uilcapampa
it
is
remarkably
extensive
on
all
sides
to
the
north
and
south
are
mountains
to
the
east
and
west
deep
valleys
furthermore
on
the
north
side
of
the
pampa
is
an
extensive
level
space
with
a
very
sumptuous
and
majestic
building
erected
with
great
skill
and
art
all
the
lintels
of
the
doors
the
principal
as
well
as
the
ordinary
ones
being
of
white
granite
elaborately
cut
at
last
we
had
found
a
place
which
seemed
to
meet
most
of
the
requirements
of
ocampo
description
of
the
fortress
of
pitcos
to
be
sure
it
was
not
of
marble
and
the
lintels
of
the
doors
were
not
carved
in
our
sense
of
the
word
they
were
however
beautifully
finished
as
may
be
seen
from
the
illustrations
and
the
white
granite
might
easily
pass
for
marble
if
only
we
could
find
in
this
vicinity
that
temple
of
the
sun
which
calancha
said
was
near
uiticos
all
doubts
would
be
at
an
end
that
night
we
stayed
at
tincochaca
in
the
hut
of
an
indian
friend
of
mogrovejo
as
usual
we
made
inquiries
imagine
our
feelings
when
in
response
to
the
question
he
said
that
in
a
neighboring
valley
there
was
a
great
white
rock
over
a
spring
of
water
if
his
story
should
prove
to
be
true
our
quest
for
uiticos
was
over
it
behooved
us
to
make
a
very
careful
study
of
what
we
had
found
chapter
xii
the
fortress
of
uiticos
and
the
house
of
the
sun
when
the
viceroy
toledo
determined
to
conquer
that
last
stronghold
of
the
incas
where
for
years
they
had
defied
the
supreme
power
of
spain
he
offered
a
thousand
dollars
a
year
as
a
pension
to
the
soldier
who
would
capture
tupac
amaru
captain
garcia
earned
the
pension
but
failed
to
receive
it
the
mañana
habit
was
already
strong
in
the
days
of
philip
ii
so
the
doughty
captain
filed
a
collection
of
testimonials
with
philip
royal
council
of
the
indies
among
these
is
his
own
statement
of
what
happened
on
the
campaign
against
tupac
amaru
in
this
he
says
and
having
arrived
at
the
principal
fortress
the
young
fortress
which
the
incas
had
fortified
we
found
it
defended
by
the
prince
philipe
quispetutio
a
son
of
the
inca
titu
cusi
with
his
captains
and
soldiers
it
is
on
a
high
eminence
surrounded
with
rugged
crags
and
jungles
very
dangerous
to
ascend
and
almost
impregnable
nevertheless
with
my
aforesaid
company
of
soldiers
i
went
up
and
gained
the
fortress
but
only
with
the
greatest
possible
labor
and
danger
thus
we
gained
the
province
of
uilcapampa
the
viceroy
himself
says
this
important
victory
was
due
to
captain
garcia
skill
and
courage
in
storming
the
heights
of
guaynapucará
on
saint
john
the
baptist
day
in
the
hill
of
roses
is
indeed
a
high
eminence
surrounded
with
rugged
crags
the
side
of
easiest
approach
is
protected
by
a
splendid
long
wall
built
so
carefully
as
not
to
leave
a
single
for
active
besiegers
the
barracks
at
uncapampa
could
have
furnished
a
contingent
to
make
an
attack
on
that
side
very
dangerous
the
hill
is
steep
on
all
sides
and
it
would
have
been
extremely
easy
for
a
small
force
to
have
defended
it
it
was
undoubtedly
almost
impregnable
this
was
the
feature
captain
garcia
was
most
likely
to
remember
on
the
very
summit
of
the
hill
are
the
ruins
of
a
partly
enclosed
compound
consisting
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
houses
arranged
so
as
to
form
a
rough
square
with
one
large
and
several
small
courtyards
the
outside
dimensions
of
the
compound
are
about
feet
by
feet
the
builders
showed
the
familiar
inca
sense
of
symmetry
in
arranging
the
houses
due
to
the
wanton
destruction
of
many
buildings
by
the
natives
in
their
efforts
at
the
walls
have
been
so
pulled
down
that
it
is
impossible
to
get
the
exact
dimensions
of
the
buildings
in
only
one
of
them
could
we
be
sure
that
there
had
been
any
niches
figure
principal
doorway
of
the
long
palace
at
rosaspata
figure
another
doorway
in
the
ruins
of
rosaspata
most
interesting
of
all
is
the
structure
which
caught
the
attention
of
ocampo
and
remained
fixed
in
his
memory
enough
remains
of
this
building
to
give
a
good
idea
of
its
former
grandeur
it
was
indeed
a
fit
residence
for
a
royal
inca
an
exile
from
cuzco
it
is
feet
by
feet
there
were
no
windows
but
it
was
lighted
by
thirty
doorways
fifteen
in
front
and
the
same
in
back
it
contained
ten
large
rooms
besides
three
hallways
running
from
front
to
rear
the
walls
were
built
rather
hastily
and
are
not
noteworthy
but
the
principal
entrances
namely
those
leading
to
each
hall
are
particularly
well
made
not
to
be
sure
of
marble
as
ocampo
said
there
is
no
marble
in
the
province
but
of
finely
cut
ashlars
of
white
granite
the
lintels
of
the
principal
doorways
as
well
as
of
the
ordinary
ones
are
also
of
solid
blocks
of
white
granite
the
largest
being
as
much
as
eight
feet
in
length
the
doorways
are
better
than
any
other
ruins
in
uilcapampa
except
those
of
machu
picchu
thus
justifying
the
mention
of
them
made
by
ocampo
who
lived
near
here
and
had
time
to
become
thoroughly
familiar
with
their
appearance
unfortunately
a
very
small
portion
of
the
edifice
was
still
standing
most
of
the
rear
doors
had
been
filled
up
with
ashlars
in
order
to
make
a
continuous
fence
other
walls
had
been
built
from
the
ruins
to
keep
cattle
out
of
the
cultivated
pampa
rosaspata
is
at
an
elevation
which
places
it
on
the
borderland
between
the
cold
grazing
country
with
its
root
crops
and
sublimated
pigweeds
and
the
temperate
zone
where
maize
flourishes
on
the
south
side
of
the
hilltop
opposite
the
long
palace
is
the
ruin
of
a
single
structure
feet
long
and
feet
wide
containing
doors
on
both
sides
no
niches
and
no
evidence
of
careful
workmanship
it
was
probably
a
barracks
for
a
company
of
soldiers
the
intervening
pampa
might
have
been
the
scene
of
those
games
of
bowls
and
quoits
which
were
played
by
the
spanish
refugees
who
fled
from
the
wrath
of
gonzalo
pizarro
and
found
refuge
with
the
inca
manco
here
may
have
occurred
that
fatal
game
when
one
of
the
players
lost
his
temper
and
killed
his
royal
host
our
excavations
in
yielded
a
mass
of
rough
potsherds
a
few
inca
and
bronze
shawl
pins
and
also
a
number
of
iron
articles
of
european
origin
heavily
rusted
horseshoe
nails
a
buckle
a
pair
of
scissors
several
bridle
or
saddle
ornaments
and
three
my
first
thought
was
that
modern
peruvians
must
have
lived
here
at
one
time
although
the
necessity
of
carrying
all
water
supplies
up
the
hill
would
make
this
unlikely
furthermore
the
presence
here
of
artifacts
of
european
origin
does
not
of
itself
point
to
such
a
conclusion
in
the
first
place
we
know
that
manco
was
accustomed
to
make
raids
on
spanish
travelers
between
cuzco
and
lima
he
might
very
easily
have
brought
back
with
him
a
spanish
bridle
in
the
second
place
the
musical
instruments
may
have
belonged
to
the
refugees
who
might
have
enjoyed
whiling
away
their
exile
with
melancholy
twanging
in
the
third
place
the
retainers
of
the
inca
probably
visited
the
spanish
market
in
cuzco
where
there
would
have
been
displayed
at
times
a
considerable
assortment
of
goods
of
european
manufacture
finally
rodriguez
de
figueroa
speaks
expressly
of
two
pairs
of
scissors
he
brought
as
a
present
to
titu
cusi
that
no
such
array
of
european
artifacts
has
been
turned
up
in
the
excavations
of
other
important
sites
in
the
province
of
uilcapampa
would
seem
to
indicate
that
they
were
abandoned
before
the
spanish
conquest
or
else
were
occupied
by
natives
who
had
no
means
of
accumulating
such
treasures
thanks
to
ocampo
description
of
the
fortress
which
tupac
amaru
was
occupying
in
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
was
the
palace
of
the
last
inca
was
it
also
the
capital
of
his
brothers
titu
cusi
and
sayri
tupac
and
his
father
manco
it
is
astonishing
how
few
details
we
have
by
which
the
uiticos
of
manco
may
be
identified
his
contemporaries
are
strangely
silent
when
he
left
cuzco
and
sought
refuge
in
the
remote
fastnesses
of
the
andes
there
was
a
spanish
soldier
cieza
de
leon
in
the
armies
of
pizarro
who
had
a
genius
for
seeing
and
hearing
interesting
things
and
writing
them
down
and
who
tried
to
interview
as
many
members
of
the
royal
family
as
he
could
manco
had
thirteen
brothers
ciezo
de
leon
says
he
was
much
disappointed
not
to
be
able
to
talk
with
manco
himself
and
his
sons
but
they
had
retired
into
the
provinces
of
uiticos
which
are
in
the
most
retired
part
of
those
regions
beyond
the
great
cordillera
of
the
andes
the
spanish
refugees
who
died
as
the
result
of
the
murder
of
manco
may
not
have
known
how
to
write
anyhow
so
far
as
we
can
learn
they
left
no
accounts
from
which
any
one
could
identify
his
residence
titu
cusi
gives
no
definite
clue
but
the
activities
of
friar
marcos
and
friar
diego
who
came
to
be
his
spiritual
advisers
are
fully
described
by
calancha
it
will
be
remembered
that
calancha
remarks
that
close
to
uiticos
in
a
village
called
chuquipalpa
is
a
house
of
the
sun
and
in
it
a
white
stone
over
a
spring
of
water
our
guide
had
told
us
there
was
such
a
place
close
to
the
hill
of
rosaspata
on
the
day
after
making
the
first
studies
of
the
hill
of
roses
i
followed
the
impatient
mogrovejo
whose
object
was
not
to
study
ruins
but
to
earn
dollars
for
finding
them
and
went
over
the
hill
on
its
northeast
side
to
the
valley
of
los
andenes
the
terraces
here
sure
enough
was
a
large
white
granite
boulder
flattened
on
top
which
had
a
carved
seat
or
platform
on
its
northern
side
its
west
side
covered
a
cave
in
which
were
several
niches
this
cave
had
been
walled
in
on
one
side
when
mogrovejo
and
the
indian
guide
said
there
was
a
manantial
de
agua
spring
of
water
near
by
i
became
greatly
interested
on
investigation
however
the
spring
turned
out
to
be
nothing
but
part
of
a
small
irrigating
ditch
manantial
means
spring
it
also
means
running
water
but
the
rock
was
not
over
the
water
although
this
was
undoubtedly
one
of
those
huacas
or
sacred
boulders
selected
by
the
incas
as
the
visible
representations
of
the
founders
of
a
tribe
and
thus
was
an
important
accessory
to
ancestor
worship
it
was
not
the
yurak
rumi
for
which
we
were
looking
figure
northeast
face
of
yurak
rumi
leaving
the
boulder
and
the
ruins
of
what
possibly
had
been
the
house
of
its
attendant
priest
we
followed
the
little
water
course
past
a
large
number
of
very
handsomely
built
agricultural
terraces
the
first
we
had
seen
since
leaving
machu
picchu
and
the
most
important
ones
in
the
valley
so
scarce
are
andenes
in
this
region
and
so
noteworthy
were
these
in
particular
that
this
vale
has
been
named
after
them
they
were
probably
built
under
the
direction
of
manco
near
them
are
a
number
of
carved
boulders
huacas
one
had
an
intihuatana
or
sundial
nubbin
on
it
another
was
carved
in
the
shape
of
a
saddle
continuing
we
followed
a
trickling
stream
through
thick
woods
until
we
suddenly
arrived
at
an
open
place
called
ñusta
isppana
here
before
us
was
a
great
white
rock
over
a
spring
our
guides
had
not
misled
us
beneath
the
trees
were
the
ruins
of
an
inca
temple
flanking
and
partly
enclosing
the
gigantic
granite
boulder
one
end
of
which
overhung
a
small
pool
of
running
water
when
we
learned
that
the
present
name
of
this
immediate
vicinity
is
chuquipalta
our
happiness
was
complete
it
was
late
on
the
afternoon
of
august
when
i
first
saw
this
remarkable
shrine
densely
wooded
hills
rose
on
every
side
there
was
not
a
hut
to
be
seen
scarcely
a
sound
to
be
heard
it
was
an
ideal
place
for
practicing
the
mystic
ceremonies
of
an
ancient
cult
the
remarkable
aspect
of
this
great
boulder
and
the
dark
pool
beneath
its
shadow
had
caused
this
to
become
a
place
of
worship
here
without
doubt
was
the
principal
mochadero
of
those
forested
mountains
it
is
still
venerated
by
the
indians
of
the
vicinity
at
last
we
had
found
the
place
where
in
the
days
of
titu
cusi
the
inca
priests
faced
the
east
greeted
the
rising
sun
extended
their
hands
toward
it
and
threw
kisses
to
it
a
ceremony
of
the
most
profound
resignation
and
reverence
we
may
imagine
the
sun
priests
clad
in
their
resplendent
robes
of
office
standing
on
the
top
of
the
rock
at
the
edge
of
its
steepest
side
their
faces
lit
up
with
the
rosy
light
of
the
early
morning
awaiting
the
moment
when
the
great
divinity
should
appear
above
the
eastern
hills
and
receive
their
adoration
as
it
rose
they
saluted
it
and
cried
o
sun
thou
who
art
in
peace
and
safety
shine
upon
us
keep
us
from
sickness
and
keep
us
in
health
and
safety
o
sun
thou
who
hast
said
let
there
be
cuzco
and
tampu
grant
that
these
children
may
conquer
all
other
people
we
beseech
thee
that
thy
children
the
incas
may
be
always
conquerors
since
it
is
for
this
that
thou
hast
created
them
figure
plan
of
the
ruins
of
the
temple
of
the
sun
at
ñusta
isppana
formerly
yurak
rumi
in
chuquipalpa
near
uiticos
it
was
during
titu
cusi
reign
that
friars
marcos
and
diego
marched
over
here
with
their
converts
from
puquiura
each
carrying
a
stick
of
firewood
calancha
says
the
indians
worshiped
the
water
as
a
divine
thing
that
the
devil
had
at
times
shown
himself
in
the
water
since
the
surface
of
the
little
pool
as
one
gazes
at
it
does
not
reflect
the
sky
but
only
the
overhanging
dark
mossy
rock
the
water
looks
black
and
forbidding
even
to
unsuperstitious
yankees
it
is
easy
to
believe
that
indian
worshipers
in
this
secluded
spot
could
readily
believe
that
they
actually
saw
the
devil
appearing
as
a
visible
manifestation
in
the
water
indians
came
from
the
most
sequestered
villages
of
the
dense
forests
to
worship
here
and
to
offer
gifts
and
sacrifices
nevertheless
the
augustinian
monks
here
raised
the
standard
of
the
cross
recited
their
orisons
and
piled
firewood
all
about

calling

all
the

names

could
think
of

him
never
to
return

scorched

impression
on

poor

to
flee
roaring
in
a
fury
the
cruel
devil
never
more
returned
to
the
rock
nor
to
this
district
whether
the
roaring
which
they
heard
was
that
of
the
devil
or
of
the
flames
we
can
only
conjecture
whether
the
conflagration
temporarily
dried
up
the
swamp
or
interfered
with
the
arrangements
of
the
water
supply
so
that
the
pool
disappeared
for
the
time
being
and
gave
the
devil
no
chance
to
appear
in
the
water
where
he
had
formerly
been
accustomed
to
show
himself
is
also
a
matter
for
speculation
the
buildings
of
the
house
of
the
sun
are
in
a
very
ruinous
state
but
the
rock
itself
with
its
curious
carvings
is
well
preserved
notwithstanding
the
great
conflagration
of
its
length
is
feet
its
width
thirty
feet
and
its
height
above
the
present
level
of
the
water
feet
on
the
west
side
of
the
rock
are
seats
and
large
steps
or
platforms
it
was
customary
to
kill
llamas
at
these
holy
huacas
on
top
of
the
rock
is
a
flattened
place
which
may
have
been
used
for
such
sacrifices
from
it
runs
a
little
crack
in
the
boulder
which
has
been
artificially
enlarged
and
may
have
been
intended
to
carry
off
the
blood
of
the
victim
killed
on
top
of
the
rock
it
is
still
used
for
occult
ceremonies
of
obscure
origin
which
are
quietly
practiced
here
by
the
more
superstitious
indian
women
of
the
valley
possibly
in
memory
of
the
ñusta
or
inca
princess
for
whom
the
shrine
is
named
on
the
south
side
of
the
monolith
are
several
large
platforms
and
four
or
five
small
seats
which
have
been
cut
in
the
rock
great
care
was
exercised
in
cutting
out
the
platforms
the
edges
are
very
nearly
square
level
and
straight
the
east
side
of
the
rock

over
the

two
seats
have
been
carved
immediately
above
the
water
on
the
north
side
there
are
no
seats
near

water
steps
have
been
carved
there
is
one
flight
of
three
and
another
of
seven
steps
above
them
the
rock
has
been
flattened
artificially
and
carved
into
a
very
bold
relief
there
are
ten
projecting
square
stones

those
usually
called
intihuatana

slightly
apart
from

the

in

above

it
is
significant
that
these
stones
are
on
the
northeast
face
of
the

they
are
exposed

two
of
the
seven
seats
near
the
spring
under
the
great
white
rock
our
excavations
yielded
no
artifacts
whatever
and
only
a
handful
of
very
rough
old
potsherds
of
uncertain
origin
the
running
water
under
the
rock
was
clear
and
appeared
to
be
a
spring
but
when
we
drained
the
swamp
which
adjoins
the
great
rock
on
its
northeastern
side
we
found
that
the
spring
was
a
little
higher
up
the
hill
and
that
the
water
ran
through
the
dark
pool
we
also
found
that
what
looked
like
a
stone
culvert
on
the
borders
of
the
little
pool
proved
to
be
the
top
of
the
back
of
a
row
of
seven
or
eight
very
fine
stone
seats
the
platform
on
which
the
seats
rested
and
the
seats
themselves
are
parts
of
three
or
four
large
rocks
nicely
fitted
together
some
of
the
seats
are
under
the
black
shadows
of
the
overhanging
rock
since
the
pool
was
an
object
of
fear
and
mystery
the
seats
were
probably
used
only
by
priests
or
sorcerers
it
would
have
been
a
splendid
place
to
practice
divination
no
doubt
the
devils
roared
all
our
expeditions
in
the
ancient
province
of
uilcapampa
have
failed
to
disclose
the
presence
of
any
other
white
rock
over
a
spring
of
water
surrounded
by
the
ruins
of
a
possible
house
of
the
sun
consequently
it
seems
reasonable
to
adopt
the
following
conclusions
first
ñusta
isppana
is
the
yurak
rumi
of
father
calancha
the
chuquipalta
of
is
the
place
to
which
he
refers
as
chuquipalpa
second
uiticos
close
to
this
shrine
was
once
the
name
of
the
present
valley
of
vilcabamba
between
tincochaca
and
lucma
this
is
the
viticos
of
cieza
de
leon
a
contemporary
of
manco
who
says
that
it
was
to
the
province
of
viticos
that
manco
determined
to
retire
when
he
rebelled
against
pizarro
and
that
having
reached
viticos
with
a
great
quantity
of
treasure
collected
from
various
parts
together
with
his
women
and
retinue
the
king
manco
inca
established
himself
in
the
strongest
place
he
could
find
whence
he
sallied
forth
many
times
and
in
many
directions
and
disturbed
those
parts
which
were
quiet
to
do
what
harm
he
could
to
the
spaniards
whom
he
considered
as
cruel
enemies
third
the
strongest
place
of
cieza
the
guaynapucará
of
garcia
was
rosaspata
referred
to
by
ocampo
as
the
fortress
of
pitcos
where
he
says
there
was
a
level
space
with
majestic
buildings
the
most
noteworthy
feature
of
which
was
that
they
had
two
kinds
of
doors
and
both
kinds
had
white
stone
lintels
fourth
the
modern
village
of
pucyura
in
the
valley
of
the
river
vilcabamba
is
the
puquiura
of
father
calancha
the
site
of
the
first
mission
church
in
this
region
as
assumed
by
raimondi
although
he
was
disappointed
in
the
insignificance
of
the
wretched
little
village
the
remains
of
the
old
plant
in
tincochaca
which
has
already
been
noted
the
distance
from
the
house
of
the
sun
not
too
great
for
the
religious
procession
and
the
location
of
pucyura
near
the
fortress
all
point
to
the
correctness
of
this
conclusion
finally
calancha
says
that
friar
ortiz
after
he
had
secured
permission
from
titu
cusi
to
establish
the
second
missionary
station
in
uilcapampa
selected
the
town
of
huarancalla
which
was
populous
and
well
located
in
the
midst
of
a
number
of
other
little
towns
and
villages
there
was
a
distance
of
two
or
three
days
journey
from
one
convent
to
the
other
leaving
friar
marcos
in
puquiura
friar
diego
went
to
his
new
establishment
and
in
a
short
time
built
a
church
there
is
no
huarancalla
nor
any
tradition
of
any
but
in
mapillo
a
pleasant
valley
at
an
elevation
of
about
feet
in
the
temperate
zone
where
the
crops
with
which
the
incas
were
familiar
might
have
been
raised
near
pastures
where
llamas
and
alpacas
could
have
flourished
is
a
place
called
huarancalque
the
valley
is
populous
and
contains
a
number
of
little
towns
and
villages
furthermore
huarancalque
is
two
or
three
days
journey
from
pucyura
and
is
on
the
road
which
the
indians
of
this
region
now
use
in
going
to
ayacucho
this
was
undoubtedly
the
route
used
by
manco
in
his
raids
on
spanish
caravans
the
mapillo
flows
into
the
apurimac
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
pampas
not
far
up
the
pampas
is
the
important
bridge
between
and
ocros
which
hay
and
i
crossed
in
on
our
way
from
cuzco
to
lima
the
city
of
ayacucho
was
founded
by
pizarro
a
day
journey
from
this
bridge
the
necessity
for
the
spanish
caravans
to
cross
the
river
pampas
at
this
point
made
it
easy
for
manco
foraging
expeditions
to
reach
them
by
sudden
marches
from
uiticos
down
the
mapillo
river
by
way
of
huarancalque
which
is
probably
the
huarancalla
of
calancha
chronicles
he
must
have
had
rafts
or
canoes
on
which
to
cross
the
apurimac
which
is
here
very
wide
and
deep
in
the
valleys
between
huarancalque
and
lucma
manco
was
cut
off
from
central
peru
by
the
apurimac
and
its
magnificent
canyon
which
in
many
places
has
a
depth
of
over
two
miles
he
was
cut
off
from
cuzco
by
the
inhospitable
snow
fields
and
glaciers
of
salcantay
soray
and
the
adjacent
ridges
even
though
they
are
only
fifty
miles
from
cuzco
frequently
all
the
passes
are
completely
fatalities
have
been
known
even
in
recent
years
in
this
mountainous
province
manco
could
be
sure
of
finding
not
only
security
from
his
spanish
enemies
but
any
climate
that
he
desired
and
an
abundance
of
food
for
his
followers
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
to
doubt
that
the
retired
region
around
the
modern
town
of
pucyura
in
the
upper
vilcabamba
valley
was
once
called
uiticos
chapter
xiii
vilcabamba
although
the
refuge
of
manco
is
frequently
spoken
of
as
uiticos
by
the
contemporary
writers
the
word
vilcabamba
or
uilcapampa
is
used
even
more
often
in
fact
garcilasso
the
chief
historian
of
the
incas
himself
the
son
of
an
inca
princess
does
not
mention
uiticos
vilcabamba
was
the
common
name
of
the
province
father
calancha
says
it
was
a
very
large
area
covering
fourteen
degrees
of
longitude
about
seven
hundred
miles
wide
it
included
many
savage
tribes
of
the
far
interior
who
acknowledged
the
supremacy
of
the
incas
and
brought
tribute
to
manco
and
his
sons
the
mañaries
and
the
pilcosones
came
a
hundred
and
two
hundred
leagues
to
visit
the
inca
in
uiticos
the
name
vilcabamba
is
also
applied
repeatedly
to
a
town
titu
cusi
says
he
lived
there
many
years
during
his
youth
calancha
says
it
was
two
days
journey
from
puquiura
raimondi
thought
it
must
be
choqquequirau
captain
garcia
soldiers
however
speak
of
it
as
being
down
in
the
warm
valleys
of
the
montaña
the
present
rubber
country
on
the
other
hand
the
only
place
which
bears
this
name
on
the
maps
of
peru
is
near
the
source
of
the
vilcabamba
river
not
more
than
three
or
four
leagues
from
pucyura
we
determined
to
visit
it
we
found
the
town
to
lie
on
the
edge
of
bleak
upland
pastures
feet
above
the
sea
instead
of
inca
walls
or
ruins
vilcabamba
has
threescore
solidly
built
spanish
houses
at
the
time
of
our
visit
they
were
mostly
empty
although
their
roofs
of
unusually
heavy
thatch
seemed
to
be
in
good
repair
we
stayed
at
the
house
of
the
gobernador
manuel
condoré
the
nights
were
bitterly
cold
and
we
should
have
been
most
uncomfortable
in
a
tent
the
gobernador
said
that
the
reason
the
town
was
deserted
was
that
most
of
the
people
were
now
attending
to
their
chacras
or
little
farms
and
looking
after
their
herds
of
sheep
and
cattle
in
the
neighboring
valleys
he
said
that
only
at
special
festival
times
such
as
the
annual
visit
of
the
priest
who
celebrates
mass
in
the
church

once
a
year
are
the
buildings
fully
occupied
in
the
latter
part
of
the
sixteenth
century
gold
mines
were
discovered
in
the
adjacent
mountains
and
the
capital
of
the
spanish
province
of
vilcabamba
was
transferred
from
hoyara
to
this
place
its
official
name
condoré
said
is
still
san
francisco
de
la
victoria
de
vilcabamba
and
as
such
it
occurs
on
most
of
the
early
maps
of
peru
the
solidity
of
the
stone
houses
was
due
to
the
prosperity
of
the
gold
diggers
the
present
air
of
desolation
and
absence
of
population
is
probably
due
to
the
decay
of
that
industry

the
church
is
large
near
it
and
slightly
apart
from
the
building
is
a
picturesque
stone
belfry
with
three
old
spanish
bells
condoré
said
that
the
church
was
built
at
least
three
hundred
years
ago
it
is
probably
the
very
structure
whose
construction
was
carefully
supervised
by
ocampo
in
the
negotiations
for
permission
to
move
the
municipality
of

in

the
viceroy
granted
the
licence
to
move
the
city
to
where
it
is
now

ordering
that
it
should
have
the
title
and
name
of
the
city

the
victory

was
its
first
name

and
solicitude
a
very
good
church
was
built
with
its
principal
chapel
and
great
doors
we
found
the
walls
to
be
heavy
massive
and
well
buttressed
the
doors
to
be
unusually
large
and
the
whole
to
show
considerable
industry
and
solicitude
the
site
was
called
onccoy
where
the
spaniards
who
first
discovered
this
land
found
the
flocks
and
herds
modern
vilcabamba
is
on
grassy
slopes
well
suited
for
flocks
and
herds
on
the
steeper
slopes
potatoes
are
still
raised
although
the
valley
itself
is
given
up
almost
entirely
to
pasture
lands
we
saw
horses
cattle
and
sheep
in
abundance
where
the
incas
must
have
pastured
their
llamas
and
alpacas
in
the
rocky
cliffs
near
by
are
remains
of
the
mines
begun
in
ocampo
day
there
is
little
doubt
that
this
was
onccoy
although
that
name
is
now
no
longer
used
here
we
met
at
the
gobernador
an
old
indian
who
admitted
that
an
inca
had
once
lived
on
rosaspata
hill
of
all
the
scores
of
persons
whom
we
interviewed
through
the
courtesy
of
the
intelligent
planters
of
the
region
or
through
the
customary
assistance
of
government
officials
this
indian
was
the
only
one
to
make
such
an
admission
even
he
denied
having
heard
of
uiticos
or
any
of
its
variations
if
we
were
indeed
in
the
country
of
manco
and
his
sons
why
should
no
one
be
familiar
with
that
name
perhaps
after
all
it
is
not
surprising
the
indians
of
the
highlands
have
now
for
so
many
generations
been
neglected
by
their
rulers
and
brutalized
by
being
allowed
to
drink
all
the
alcohol
they
can
purchase
and
to
assimilate
all
the
cocaine
they
can
secure
through
the
constant
chewing
of
coca
leaves
that
they
have
lost
much
if
not
all
of
their
racial
it
is
the
educated
mestizos
of
the
principal
modern
cities
of
peru
who
tracing
their
descent
not
only
from
the
spanish
soldiers
of
the
conquest
but
also
from
the
blood
of
the
race
which
was
conquered
take
pride
in
the
achievements
of
the
incas
and
are
endeavoring
to
preserve
the
remains
of
the
wonderful
civilization
of
their
native
ancestors
until
quite
recently
vilcabamba
was
an
unknown
land
to
most
of
the
peruvians
even
those
who
live
in
the
city
of
cuzco
had
the
capital
of
the
last
four
incas
been
in
a
region
whose
climate
appealed
to
europeans
whose
natural
resources
were
sufficient
to
support
a
large
population
and
whose
roads
made
transportation
no
more
difficult
than
in
most
parts
of
the
andes
it
would
have
been
occupied
from
the
days
of
captain
garcia
to
the
present
by
mestizos
who
might
have
been
interested
in
preserving
the
name
of
the
ancient
inca
capital
and
the
traditions
connected
with
it
after
the
mines
which
attracted
ocampo
and
his
friends
petered
out
or
else
with
the
primitive
tools
of
the
sixteenth
century
ceased
to
yield
adequate
returns
the
spaniards
lost
interest
in
that
remote
region
the
rude
trails
which
connected
pucyura
with
cuzco
and
civilization
were
at
best
dangerous
and
difficult
they
were
veritably
impassable
during
a
large
part
of
the
year
even
to
people
accustomed
to
andean
roads
the
possibility
of
raising
sugar
cane
and
coca
between
huadquiña
and
santa
ana
attracted
a
few
people
to
live
in
the
lower
urubamba
valley
notwithstanding
the
difficult
transportation
over
the
passes
near
mts
salcantay
and
veronica
but
there
was
nothing
to
lead
any
one
to
visit
the
upper
vilcabamba
valley
or
to
desire
to
make
it
a
place
of
residence
and
until
señor
pancorbo
opened
the
road
to
lucma
pucyura
was
extremely
difficult
of
access
nine
generations
of
indians
lived
and
died
in
the
province
of
uilcapampa
between
the
time
of
tupac
amaru
and
the
arrival
of
the
first
modern
explorers
the
great
stone
buildings
constructed
on
the
hill
of
roses
in
the
days
of
manco
and
his
sons
were
allowed
to
fall
into
ruin
their
roofs
decayed
and
disappeared
the
names
of
those
who
once
lived
here
were
known
to
fewer
and
fewer
of
the
natives
the
indians
themselves
had
no
desire
to
relate
the
story
of
the
various
forts
and
palaces
to
their
spanish
landlords
nor
had
the
latter
any
interest
in
hearing
such
tales
it
was
not
until
the
renaissance
of
historical
and
geographical
curiosity
in
the
nineteenth
century
that
it
occurred
to
any
one
to
look
for
manco
capital
when
raimondi
the
first
scientist
to
penetrate
vilcabamba
reached
pucyura
no
one
thought
to
tell
him
that
on
the
hilltop
opposite
the
village
once
lived
the
last
of
the
incas
and
that
the
ruins
of
their
palaces
were
still
there
hidden
underneath
a
thick
growth
of
trees
and
vines
a
spanish
document
of
says
the
first
town
of
san
francisco
de
la
victoria
de
vilcabamba
was
in
the
valley
of
viticos
the
town
long
name
became
shortened
to
vilcabamba
then
the
river
which
flowed
past
was
called
the
vilcabamba
and
is
so
marked
on
map
uiticos
had
long
since
passed
from
the
memory
of
man
furthermore
the
fact
that
we
saw
no
llamas
or
alpacas
in
the
upland
pastures
but
only
domestic
animals
of
european
origin
would
also
seem
to
indicate
that
for
some
reason
or
other
this
region
had
been
abandoned
by
the
indians
themselves
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
if
the
indians
had
inhabited
these
valleys
continuously
from
inca
times
to
the
present
we
should
not
have
found
at
least
a
few
of
the
indigenous
american
camels
here
by
itself
such
an
occurrence
would
hardly
seem
worth
a
remark
but
taken
in
connection
with
the
loss
of
traditions
regarding
uiticos
it
would
seem
to
indicate
that
there
must
have
been
quite
a
long
period
of
time
in
which
no
persons
of
consequence
lived
in
this
vicinity
we
are
told
by
the
historians
of
the
colonial
period
that
the
mining
operations
of
the
first
spanish
settlers
were
fatal
to
at
least
a
million
indians
it
is
quite
probable
that
the
introduction
of
ordinary
european
contagious
diseases
such
as
measles
chicken
pox
and
smallpox
may
have
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
destruction
of
a
large
proportion
of
those
unfortunates
whose
untimely
deaths
were
attributed
by
historians
to
the
very
cruel
practices
of
the
early
spanish
miners
and
treasure
seekers
both
causes
undoubtedly
contributed
to
the
result
there
seems
to
be
no
question
that
the
population
diminished
enormously
in
early
colonial
days
if
this
is
true
the
remaining
population
would
naturally
have
sought
regions
where
the
conditions
of
existence
and
human
intercourse
were
less
severe
and
rigorous
than
in
the
valleys
of
uiticos
and
uilcapampa
the
students
and
travelers
of
the
late
nineteenth
and
early
twentieth
centuries
including
such
a
careful
observer
as
bandelier
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
population
in
the
andes
of
peru
and
bolivia
is
about
as
great
as
that
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
in
other
words
with
the
decay
of
early
colonial
mining
and
the
consequent
disappearance
of
bad
living
conditions
and
forced
labor
at
the
mines
also
with
the
rise
of
partial
immunity
to
european
diseases
and
the
more
comfortable
conditions
of
existence
which
have
followed
the
coming
of
peruvian
independence
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
number
of
highland
indians
has
increased
with
this
increase
has
come
a
consequent
crowding
in
certain
localities
there
would
be
a
natural
tendency
to
seek
less
crowded
regions
even
at
the
expense
of
using
difficult
mountain
trails
this
would
lead
to
their
occupying
as
remote
and
inaccessible
a
region
as
the
ancient
province
of
uilcapampa
it
is
probable
that
after
the
gold
mines
ceased
to
pay
and
before
the
demand
for
rubber
caused
the
san
miguel
valley
to
be
appropriated
by
the
white
man
there
was
a
period
of
nearly
three
hundred
years
when
no
one
of
education
or
of
intelligence
superior
to
the
ordinary
indian
shepherd
lived
anywhere
near
pucyura
or
lucma
the
adobe
houses
of
these
modern
villages
look
fairly
modern
they
may
have
been
built
in
the
nineteenth
century
such
a
theory
would
account
for
the
very
small
amount
of
information
prevailing
in
peru
regarding
the
region
where
we
had
been
privileged
to
find
so
many
ruins
this
ignorance
led
the
peruvian
geographers
raimondi
and
paz
soldan
to
conclude
that
choqquequirau
the
only
ruins
reported
between
the
apurimac
and
the
urubamba
must
have
been
the
capital
of
the
incas
who
took
refuge
there
it
also
makes
it
seem
more
reasonable
that
the
existence
of
rosaspata
and
ñusta
isppana
should
not
have
been
known
to
peruvian
geographers
and
historians
or
even
to
the
government
officials
who
lived
in
the
adjacent
villages
we
felt
sure
we
had
found
uiticos
nevertheless
it
was
quite
apparent
that
we
had
not
yet
found
all
the
places
which
were
called
vilcabamba
examination
of
the
writers
of
the
sixteenth
century
shows
that
there
may
have
been
three
places
bearing
that
name
one
spoken
of
by
calancha
as
vilcabamba
viejo
the
old
another
also
so
called
by
ocampo
and
a
third
founded
by
the
spaniards
namely
the
town
we
were
now
in
the
story
of
the
first
is
given
in
calancha
account
of
the
trials
and
tribulations
of
friar
marcos
and
the
martyrdom
of
friar
diego
ortiz
the
chronicler
tells
with
considerable
detail
of
their
visit
to
vilcabamba
viejo
it
was
after
the
monks
had
already
founded
their
religious
establishment
at
puquiura
that
they
learned
of
the
existence
of
this
important
religious
center
they
urged
titu
cusi
to
permit
them
to
visit
it
for
a
long
time
he
refused
its
whereabouts
remained
unknown
to
them
but
its
strategic
position
as
a
religious
stronghold
led
them
to
continue
their
demands
finally
either
to
rid
himself
of
their
importunities
or
because
he
imagined
the
undertaking
might
be
made
amusing
he
yielded
to
their
requests
and
bade
them
prepare
for
the
journey
calancha
says
that
the
inca
himself
accompanied
the
two
friars
with
a
number
of
his
captains
and
chieftains
taking
them
from
puquiura
over
a
very
rough
and
rugged
road
the
inca
however
did
not
suffer
from
the
character
of
the
trail
because
like
the
roman
generals
of
old
he
was
borne
comfortably
along
in
a
litter
by
servants
accustomed
to
this
duty
the
unfortunate
missionaries
were
obliged
to
go
on
foot
the
wet
rocky
trail
soon
demoralized
their
footgear
when
they
came
to
a
particularly
bad
place
in
the
road
ungacacha
the
trail
went
for
some
distance
through
water
the
monks
were
forced
to
wade
the
water
was
very
cold
the
inca
and
his
chieftains
were
amused
to
see
how
the
friars
were
hampered
by
their
monastic
garments
while
passing
through
the
water
however
the
monks
persevered
greatly
desiring
to
reach
their
goal
on
account
of
its
being
the
largest
city
in
which
was
the
university
of
idolatry
where
lived
the
teachers
who
were
wizards
and
masters
of
abomination
if
one
may
judge
by
the
name
of
the
place
uilcapampa
the
wizards
and
sorcerers
were
probably
aided
by
the
powerful
effects
of
the
ancient
snuff
made
from
huilca
seeds
after
a
three
days
journey
over
very
rough
country
the
monks
arrived
at
their
destination
yet
even
then
titu
cusi
was
unwilling
that
they
should
live
in
the
city
but
ordered
that
the
monks
be
given
a
dwelling
outside
so
that
they
might
not
witness
the
ceremonies
and
ancient
rites
which
were
practiced
by
the
inca
and
his
captains
and
priests
nothing
is
said
about
the
appearance
of
vilcabamba
viejo
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
monks
were
ever
allowed
to
see
the
city
although
they
reached
its
vicinity
here
they
stayed
for
three
weeks
and
kept
up
their
preaching
and
teaching
during
their
stay
titu
cusi
who
had
not
wished
to
bring
them
here
got
his
revenge
by
annoying
them
in
various
ways
he
was
particularly
anxious
to
make
them
break
their
vows
of
celibacy
calancha
says
that
after
consultation
with
his
priests
and
soothsayers
titu
cusi
selected
as
tempters
the
most
beautiful
indian
women
including
some
individuals
of
the
yungas
who
were
unusually
attractive
it
is
possible
that
these
women
who
lived
at
the
university
of
idolatry
in
vilcabamba
viejo
were
virgins
of
the
sun
who
were
under
the
orders
of
the
inca
and
his
high
priests
and
were
selected
from
the
fairest
daughters
of
the
empire
it
is
also
evident
that
vilcabamba
viejo
was
so
constructed
that
the
monks
could
be
kept
for
three
weeks
in
its
vicinity
without
being
able
to
see
what
was
going
on
in
the
city
or
to
describe
the
kinds
of
abominations
which
were
practiced
there
as
they
did
those
at
the
white
rock
of
chuquipalta
as
will
be
shown
later
it
is
possible
that
this
vilcabamba
referred
to
in
calancha
story
as
vilcabamba
viejo
was
on
the
slopes
of
the
mountain
now
called
machu
picchu
in
the
meantime
it
was
necessary
to
pursue
the
hunt
for
the
ruins
of
vilcabamba
called
the
old
by
ocampo
to
distinguish
it
from
the
spanish
town
of
that
name
which
he
had
helped
to
found
after
the
capture
of
tupac
amaru
and
referred
to
merely
as
vilcabamba
by
captain
garcia
and
his
companions
in
their
accounts
of
the
campaign
chapter
xiv
conservidayoc
when
don
pedro
duque
of
santa
aria
was
helping
us
to
identify
places
mentioned
in
calancha
and
ocampo
the
references
to
vilcabamba
viejo
or
old
uilcapampa
were
supposed
by
two
of
his
informants
to
point
to
a
place
called
conservidayoc
don
pedro
told
us
that
in
lopez
torres
who
had
traveled
much
in
the
montaña
looking
for
rubber
trees
reported
the
discovery
there
of
the
ruins
of
an
inca
city
all
of
don
pedro
friends
assured
us
that
conservidayoc
was
a
terrible
place
to
reach
no
one
now
living
had
been
there
it
was
inhabited
by
savage
indians
who
would
not
let
strangers
enter
their
villages
when
we
reached
paltaybamba
señor
pancorbo
manager
confirmed
what
we
had
heard
he
said
further
that
an
individual
named
saavedra
lived
at
conservidayoc
and
undoubtedly
knew
all
about
the
ruins
but
was
very
averse
to
receiving
visitors
saavedra
house
was
extremely
difficult
to
find
no
one
had
been
there
recently
and
returned
alive
opinions
differed
as
to
how
far
away
it
was
several
days
later
while
professor
foote
and
i
were
studying
the
ruins
near
rosaspata
señor
pancorbo
returning
from
his
rubber
estate
in
the
san
miguel
valley
and
learning
at
lucma
of
our
presence
near
by
took
great
pains
to
find
us
and
see
how
we
were
progressing
when
he
learned
of
our
intention
to
search
for
the
ruins
of
conservidayoc
he
asked
us
to
desist
from
the
attempt
he
said
saavedra
was
a
very
powerful
man
having
many
indians
under
his
control
and
living
in
grand
state
with
fifty
servants
and
not
at
all
desirous
of
being
visited
by
anybody
the
indians
were
of
the
campa
tribe
very
wild
and
extremely
savage
they
use
poisoned
arrows
and
are
very
hostile
to
strangers
admitting
that
he
had
heard
there
were
inca
ruins
near
saavedra
station
señor
pancorbo
still
begged
us
not
to
risk
our
lives
by
going
to
look
for
them
by
this
time
our
curiosity
was
thoroughly
aroused
we
were
familiar
with
the
current
stories
regarding
the
habits
of
savage
tribes
who
lived
in
the
montaña
and
whose
services
were
in
great
demand
as
rubber
gatherers
we
had
even
heard
that
indians
did
not
particularly
like
to
work
for
señor
pancorbo
who
was
an
energetic
ambitious
man
anxious
to
achieve
many
things
results
which
required
more
laborers
than
could
easily
be
obtained
we
could
readily
believe
there
might
possibly
be
indians
at
conservidayoc
who
had
escaped
from
the
rubber
estate
of
san
miguel
undoubtedly
señor
pancorbo
own
life
would
have
been
at
the
mercy
of
their
poisoned
arrows
all
over
the
amazon
basin
the
exigencies
of
rubber
gatherers
had
caused
tribes
visited
with
impunity
by
the
explorers
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
become
so
savage
and
revengeful
as
to
lead
them
to
kill
all
white
men
at
sight
professor
foote
and
i
considered
the
matter
in
all
its
aspects
we
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
in
view
of
the
specific
reports
regarding
the
presence
of
inca
ruins
at
conservidayoc
we
could
not
afford
to
follow
the
advice
of
the
friendly
planter
we
must
at
least
make
an
effort
to
reach
them
meanwhile
taking
every
precaution
to
avoid
arousing
the
enmity
of
the
powerful
saavedra
and
his
savage
retainers
figure

about

ruins
figure
one
of
our
bearers
crossing
the
pampaconas
river
on
the
day
following
our
arrival
at
the
town
of
vilcabamba
the
gobernador
condoré
taking
counsel
with
his
chief
assistant
had
summoned
the
wisest
indians
living
in
the
vicinity
including
a
very
picturesque
old
fellow
whose
name
quispi
cusi
was
strongly
reminiscent
of
the
days
of
titu
cusi
it
was
explained
to
him
that
this
was
a
very
solemn
occasion
and
that
an
official
inquiry
was
in
progress
he
took
off
his
hat
but
not
his
knitted
cap
and
endeavored
to
the
best
of
his
ability
to
answer
our
questions
about
the
surrounding
country
it
was
he
who
said
that
the
inca
tupac
amaru
once
lived
at
rosaspata
he
had
never
heard
of
uilcapampa
viejo
but
he
admitted
that
there
were
ruins
in
the
montaña
near
conservidayoc
other
indians
were
questioned
by
condoré
several
had
heard
of
the
ruins
of
conservidayoc
but
apparently
none
of
them
nor
any
one
in
the
village
had
actually
seen
the
ruins
or
visited
their
immediate
vicinity
they
all
agreed
that
saavedra
place
was
at
least
four
days
hard
journey
on
foot
in
the
montaña
beyond
pampaconas
no
village
of
that
name
appeared
on
any
map
of
peru
although
it
is
frequently
mentioned
in
the
documents
of
the
sixteenth
century
rodriguez
de
figueroa
who
came
to
seek
an
audience
with
titu
cusi
about
says
that
he
met
titu
cusi
at
a
place
called
banbaconas
he
says
further
that
the
inca
came
there
from
somewhere
down
in
the
dense
forests
of
the
montaña
and
presented
him
with
a
macaw
and
two
hampers
of
peanuts
products
of
a
warm
region
we
had
brought
with
us
the
large
sheets
of
raimondi
invaluable
map
which
covered
this
locality
we
also
had
the
new
map
of
south
peru
and
north
bolivia
which
had
just
been
published
by
the
royal
geographical
society
and
gave
a
summary
of
all
available
information
the
indians
said
that
conservidayoc
lay
in
a
westerly
direction
from
vilcabamba
yet
on
raimondi
map
all
of
the
rivers
which
rise
in
the
mountains
west
of
the
town
are
short
affluents
of
the
apurimac
and
flow
southwest
we
wondered
whether
the
stories
about
ruins
at
conservidayoc
would
turn
out
to
be
as
barren
of
foundation
as
those
we
had
heard
from
the
trustworthy
foreman
at
huadquiña
one
of
our
informants
said
the
inca
city
was
called
espiritu
pampa
or
the
pampa
of
ghosts
would
the
ruins
turn
out
to
be
ghosts
would
they
vanish
on
the
arrival
of
white
men
with
cameras
and
steel
measuring
tapes
no
one
at
vilcabamba
had
seen
the
ruins
but
they
said
that
at
the
village
of
pampaconas
about
five
leagues
from
here
there
were
indians
who
had
actually
been
to
conservidayoc
our
supplies
were
getting
low
there
were
no
shops
nearer
than
lucma
no
food
was
obtainable
from
the
natives
accordingly
notwithstanding
the
protestations
of
the
hospitable
gobernador
we
decided
to
start
immediately
for
conservidayoc
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
march
up
the
vilcabamba
valley
professor
foote
with
his
accustomed
skill
was
preparing
the
evening
meal
and
we
were
both
looking
forward
with
satisfaction
to
enjoying
large
cups
of
our
favorite
beverage
several
years
ago
when
traveling
on
muleback
across
the
great
plateau
of
southern
bolivia
i
had
learned
the
value
of
sweet
hot
tea
as
a
stimulant
and
bracer
in
the
high
andes
at
first
astonished
to
see
how
much
tea
the
indian
arrieros
drank
i
learned
from
sad
experience
that
it
was
far
better
than
cold
water
which
often
brings
on
this
particular
evening
one
swallow
of
the
hot
tea
caused
consternation
it
was
the
most
horrible
stuff
imaginable
examination
showed
small
oily
particles
floating
on
the
surface
further
investigation
led
to
the
discovery
that
one
of
our
arrieros
had
that
day
placed
our
can
of
kerosene
on
top
of
one
of
the
loads
the
tin
became
leaky
and
the
kerosene
had
dripped
down
into
a
food
box
a
cloth
bag
of
granulated
sugar
had
eagerly
absorbed
all
the
oil
it
could
there
was
no
remedy
but
to
throw
away
half
of
our
supply
as
i
have
said
the
longer
one
works
in
the
andes
the
more
desirable
does
sugar
become
and
the
more
one
seems
to
crave
it
yet
we
were
unable
to
procure
any
here
after
the
usual
delays
caused
in
part
by
the
difficulty
of
catching
our
mules
which
had
taken
advantage
of
our
historical
investigations
to
stray
far
up
the
mountain
pastures
we
finally
set
out
from
the
boundaries
of
known
topography
headed
for
conservidayoc
a
vague
place
surrounded
with
mystery
a
land
of
hostile
savages
albeit
said
to
possess
the
ruins
of
an
inca
town
our
first
day
journey
was
to
pampaconas
here
and
in
its
vicinity
the
gobernador
told
us
he
could
procure
guides
and
the
carriers
whose
services
we
should
require
for
the
jungle
trail
where
mules
could
not
be
used
as
the
indians
hereabouts
were
averse
to
penetrating
the
wilds
of
conservidayoc
and
were
also
likely
to
be
extremely
alarmed
at
the
sight
of
men
in
uniform
the
two
gendarmes
who
were
now
accompanying
us
were
instructed
to
delay
their
departure
for
a
few
hours
and
not
to
reach
pampaconas
with
our
pack
train
until
dusk
the
gobernador
said
that
if
the
indians
of
pampaconas
caught
sight
of
any
brass
buttons
coming
over
the
hills
they
would
hide
so
effectively
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
secure
any
carriers
apparently
this
was
due
in
part
to
that
love
of
freedom
which
had
led
them
to
abandon
the
more
comfortable
towns
for
a
frontier
village
where
landlords
could
not
call
on
them
for
forced
labor
consequently
before
the
arrival
of
any
such
striking
manifestations
of
official
authority
as
our
gendarmes
the
gobernador
and
his
friend
mogrovejo
proposed
to
put
in
the
day
craftily
commandeering
the
services
of
a
sturdy
indians
their
methods
will
be
described
presently
leaving
modern
vilcabamba
we
crossed
the
flat
marshy
bottom
of
an
old
glaciated
valley
in
which
one
of
our
mules
got
thoroughly
mired
while
searching
for
the
succulent
grasses
which
cover
the
treacherous
bog
fording
the
vilcabamba
river
which
here
is
only
a
tiny
brook
we
climbed
out
of
the
valley
and
turned
westward
on
the
mountains
above
us
were
vestiges
of
several
abandoned
mines
it
was
their
discovery
in
or
thereabouts
which
brought
ocampo
and
the
first
spanish
settlers
to
this
valley
raimondi
says
that
he
found
here
cobalt
nickel
copper
ore
and
lead
sulphide
he
does
not
mention
any
quartz
it
may
have
been
exhausted
long
before
his
day
as
to
the
other
minerals
the
difficulties
of
transportation
are
so
great
that
it
is
not
likely
that
mining
will
be
renewed
here
for
many
years
to
come
at
the
top
of
the
pass
we
turned
to
look
back
and
saw
a
long
chain
of
mountains
towering
above
and
behind
the
town
of
vilcabamba
we
searched
in
vain
for
them
on
our
maps
raimondi
followed
by
the
royal
geographical
society
did
not
leave
room
enough
for
such
a
range
to
exist
between
the
rivers
apurimac
and
urubamba
hendriksen
determined
our
longitude
to
be
west
and
our
latitude
to
be
south
yet
according
to
the
latest
map
of
this
region
published
in
the
preceding
year
this
was
the
very
position
of
the
river
apurimac
itself
near
its
junction
with
the
river
pampas
we
ought
to
have
been
swimming
the
great
speaker
actually
we
were
on
top
of
a
lofty
mountain
pass
surrounded
by
high
peaks
and
glaciers
the
mystery
was
finally
solved
by
bumstead
in
when
he
determined
the
apurimac
and
the
urubamba
to
be
thirty
miles
farther
apart
than
any
one
had
supposed
his
surveys
opened
an
unexplored
region
square
miles
in
extent
whose
very
existence
had
not
been
guessed
before
it
proved
to
be
one
of
the
largest
undescribed
glaciated
areas
in
south
america
yet
it
is
less
than
a
hundred
miles
from
cuzco
the
chief
city
in
the
peruvian
andes
and
the
site
of
a
university
for
more
than
three
centuries
that
uilcapampa
could
so
long
defy
investigation
and
exploration
shows
better
than
anything
else
how
wisely
manco
had
selected
his
refuge
it
is
indeed
a
veritable
labyrinth
of
peaks
unknown
glaciers
and
trackless
canyons
looking
west
we
saw
in
front
of
us
a
great
wilderness
of
deep
green
valleys
and
slopes
we
supposed
from
our
maps
that
we
were
now
looking
down
into
the
basin
of
the
apurimac
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
were
on
the
rim
of
the
valley
of
the
hitherto
uncharted
pampaconas
a
branch
of
the
cosireni
one
of
the
affluents
of
the
urubamba
instead
of
being
the
apurimac
basin
what
we
saw
was
another
unexplored
region
which
drained
into
the
urubamba
at
the
time
however
we
did
not
know
where
we
were
but
understood
from
condoré
that
somewhere
far
down
in
the
montaña
below
us
was
conservidayoc
the
sequestered
domain
of
saavedra
and
his
savage
indians
it
seemed
less
likely
than
ever
that
the
incas
could
have
built
a
town
so
far
away
from
the
climate
and
food
to
which
they
were
accustomed
the
road
was
now
so
bad
that
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
could
we
coax
our
mules
to
follow
it
once
we
had
to
dismount
as
the
path
led
down
a
long
steep
rocky
stairway
of
ancient
origin
at
last
rounding
a
hill
we
came
in
sight
of
a
lonesome
little
hut
perched
on
a
shoulder
of
the
mountain
in
front
of
it
seated
in
the
sun
on
mats
were
two
women
shelling
corn
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
gobernador
approaching
they
stopped
their
work
and
began
to
prepare
lunch
it
was
about
eleven
and
they
did
not
need
to
be
told
that
señor
condoré
and
his
friends
had
not
had
anything
but
a
cup
of
coffee
since
the
night
before
in
order
to
meet
the
emergency
of
unexpected
guests
they
killed
four
or
five
squealing
cuys
guinea
pigs
usually
to
be
found
scurrying
about
the
mud
floor
of
the
huts
of
mountain
indians
before
long
the
savory
odor
of
roast
cuy
well
basted
and
on
primitive
spits
whetted
our
appetites
in
the
eastern
united
states
one
sees
guinea
pigs
only
as
pets
or
laboratory
victims
never
as
an
article
of
food
in
spite
of
the
celebrated
dogma
that
pigs
is
pigs
this
form
of
pork
has
never
found
its
way
to
our
kitchens
even
though
these
pigs
live
on
a
very
clean
vegetable
diet
incidentally
guinea
pigs
do
not
come
from
guinea
and
are
in
no
way
related
to
pigs
ellis
parker
butler
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
they
belong
rather
to
the
same
family
as
rabbits
and
belgian
hares
and
have
long
been
a
highly
prized
article
of
food
in
the
andes
of
peru
the
wild
species
are
of
a
grayish
brown
color
which
enables
them
to
escape
observation
in
their
natural
habitat
the
domestic
varieties
which
one
sees
in
the
huts
of
the
indians
are
piebald
black
white
and
tawny
varying
from
one
another
in
color
as
much
as
do
the
llamas
which
were
also
domesticated
by
the
same
race
of
people
thousands
of
years
ago
although
folkways
as
professor
sumner
would
say
permit
us
to
eat
and
enjoy
rabbits
we
draw
the
line
at
rabbits
yet
they
were
bred
to
be
eaten
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
this
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
ever
knowingly
tasted
their
delicate
flesh
although
once
in
the
capital
of
bolivia
i
thought
the
hotel
kitchen
had
a
diminishing
supply
had
i
not
been
very
hungry
i
might
never
have
known
how
delicious
a
roast
guinea
pig
can
be
the
meat
is
not
unlike
squab
to
the
indians
whose
supply
of
animal
food
is
small
whose
fowls
are
treasured
for
their
eggs
and
whose
thin
sheep
are
more
valuable
as
wool
bearers
than
as
mutton
the
succulent
guinea
pig
most
prolific
of
mammals
as
was
discovered
by
butler
hero
is
a
highly
valued
article
of
food
reserved
for
special
occasions
the
north
american
housewife
keeps
a
few
tins
of
sardines
and
cans
of
preserves
on
hand
for
emergencies
her
sister
in
the
andes
similarly
relies
on
fat
little
cuys
after
lunch
condoré
and
mogrovejo
divided
the
extensive
rolling
countryside
between
them
and
each
rode
quietly
from
one
lonesome
farm
to
another
looking
for
men
to
engage
as
bearers
when
they
were
so
fortunate
as
to
find
the
man
of
the
house
at
home
or
working
in
his
little
chacra
they
greeted
him
pleasantly
when
he
came
forward
to
shake
hands
in
the
usual
indian
manner
a
silver
dollar
was
slipped
into
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
and
he
was
informed
that
he
had
accepted
pay
for
services
which
must
now
be
performed
it
seemed
hard
but
this
was
the
only
way
in
which
it
was
possible
to
secure
carriers
during
inca
times
the
indians
never
received
pay
for
their
labor
a
paternal
government
saw
to
it
that
they
were
properly
fed
and
clothed
and
either
given
abundant
opportunity
to
provide
for
their
own
necessities
or
else
permitted
to
draw
on
official
stores
in
colonial
days
a
more
greedy
and
less
paternal
government
took
advantage
of
the
ancient
system
and
enforced
it
without
taking
pains
to
see
that
it
should
not
cause
suffering
then
for
generations
thoughtless
landlords
backed
by
local
authority
forced
the
indians
to
work
without
suitably
recompensing
them
at
the
end
of
their
labors
or
even
pretending
to
carry
out
promises
and
wage
agreements
the
peons
learned
that
it
was
unwise
to
perform
any
labor
without
first
having
received
a
considerable
portion
of
their
pay
when
once
they
accepted
money
however
their
own
custom
and
the
law
of
the
land
provided
that
they
must
carry
out
their
obligations
failure
to
do
so
meant
legal
punishment
consequently
when
an
unfortunate
pampaconas
indian
found
he
had
a
dollar
in
his
hand
he
bemoaned
his
fate
but
realized
that
service
was
inevitable
in
vain
did
he
plead
that
he
was
busy
that
his
crops
needed
attention
that
his
family
could
not
spare
him
that
he
lacked
food
for
a
journey
condoré
and
mogrovejo
were
accustomed
to
all
varieties
of
excuses
they
succeeded
in
engaging
half
a
dozen
carriers
before
dark
we
reached
the
village
of
pampaconas
a
few
small
huts
scattered
over
grassy
hillsides
at
an
elevation
of
feet
in
the
notes
of
one
of
the
military
advisers
of
viceroy
francisco
de
toledo
is
a
reference
to
pampaconas
as
a
high
cold
place
this
is
correct
nevertheless
i
doubt
if
the
present
village
is
the
pampaconas
mentioned
in
the
documents
of
garcia
day
as
being
an
important
town
of
the
incas
there
are
no
ruins
hereabouts
the
huts
of
pampaconas
were
newly
built
of
stone
and
mud
and
thatched
with
grass
they
were
occupied
by
a
group
of
sturdy
mountain
indians
who
enjoyed
unusual
freedom
from
official
or
other
interference
and
a
good
place
in
which
to
raise
sheep
and
cultivate
potatoes
on
the
very
edge
of
the
dense
forest
we
found
that
there
was
some
excitement
in
the
village
because
on
the
previous
night
a
jaguar
or
possibly
a
cougar
had
come
out
of
the
forest
attacked
killed
and
dragged
off
one
of
the
village
ponies
we
were
conducted
to
the
dwelling
of
a
stocky
indian
named
guzman
the
most
reliable
man
in
the
village
who
had
been
selected
to
be
the
head
of
the
party
of
carriers
that
was
to
accompany
us
to
conservidayoc
guzman
had
some
spanish
blood
in
his
veins
although
he
did
not
boast
of
it
with
his
wife
and
six
children
he
occupied
one
of
the
best
huts
a
fire
in
one
corner
frequently
filled
it
with
acrid
smoke
it
was
very
small
and
had
no
windows
at
one
end
was
a
loft
where
family
treasures
could
be
kept
dry
and
reasonably
safe
from
molestation
piles
of
sheep
skins
were
arranged
for
visitors
to
sit
upon
three
or
four
rude
niches
in
the
walls
served
in
lieu
of
shelves
and
tables
the
floor
of
clay
was
damp
three
mongrel
dogs
and
a
cat
were
welcome
to
share
the
narrow
space
with
the
family
and
their
visitors
a
dozen
hogs
entered
stealthily
and
tried
to
avoid
attention
by
putting
a
muffler
on
involuntary
grunts
they
did
not
succeed
and
were
violently
ejected
by
a
boy
with
a
whip
only
to
return
again
and
again
each
time
to
be
driven
out
as
before
squealing
loudly
notwithstanding
these
interruptions
we
carried
on
a
most
interesting
conversation
with
guzman
he
had
been
to
conservidayoc
and
had
himself
actually
seen
ruins
at
espiritu
pampa
at
last
the
mythical
pampa
of
ghosts
began
to
take
on
in
our
minds
an
aspect
of
reality
even
though
we
were
careful
to
remind
ourselves
that
another
very
trustworthy
man
had
said
he
had
seen
ruins
finer
than
ollantaytambo
near
huadquiña
guzman
did
not
seem
to
dread
conservidayoc
as
much
as
the
other
indians
only
one
of
whom
had
ever
been
there
to
cheer
them
up
we
purchased
a
fat
sheep
for
which
we
paid
fifty
cents
guzman
immediately
butchered
it
in
preparation
for
the
journey
although
it
was
august
and
the
middle
of
the
dry
season
rain
began
to
fall
early
in
the
afternoon
sergeant
carrasco
arrived
after
dark
with
our
pack
animals
but
missing
the
trail
as
he
neared
guzman
place
one
of
the
mules
stepped
into
a
bog
and
was
extracted
only
with
considerable
difficulty
we
decided
to
pitch
our
small
pyramidal
tent
on
a
fairly
bit
of
turf
not
far
from
guzman
little
hut
in
the
evening
after
we
had
had
a
long
talk
with
the
indians
we
came
back
through
the
rain
to
our
comfortable
little
tent
only
to
hear
various
and
sundry
grunts
emerging
therefrom
we
found
that
during
our
absence
a
large
sow
and
six
fat
young
pigs
unable
to
settle
down
comfortably
at
the
guzman
hearth
had
decided
that
our
tent
was
much
the
driest
available
place
on
the
mountain
side
and
that
our
blankets
made
a
particularly
attractive
bed
they
had
considerable
difficulty
in
getting
out
of
the
small
door
as
fast
as
they
wished
nevertheless
the
pouring
rain
and
the
memory
of
comfortable
blankets
caused
the
pigs
to
return
at
intervals
as
we
were
starting
to
enjoy
our
first
nap
guzman
with
hospitable
intent
sent
us
two
bowls
of
steaming
soup
which
at
first
glance
seemed
to
contain
various
sizes
of
white
macaroni
a
dish
of
which
one
of
us
was
particularly
fond
the
white
hollow
cylinders
proved
to
be
extraordinarily
tough
not
the
usual
kind
of
macaroni
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
learned
that
the
evening
meal
which
wife
had
prepared
for
her
guests
was
made
chiefly
of
sheep
entrails
rain
continued
without
intermission
during
the
whole
of
a
very
cold
and
dreary
night
our
tent
which
had
never
been
wet
before
leaked
badly
the
only
part
which
seemed
to
be
thoroughly
waterproof
was
the
floor
as
day
dawned
we
found
ourselves
to
be
lying
in
puddles
of
water
everything
was
soaked
furthermore
rain
was
still
failing
while
we
were
discussing
the
situation
and
wondering
what
we
should
cook
for
breakfast
the
faithful
guzman
heard
our
voices
and
immediately
sent
us
two
more
bowls
of
hot
soup
which
were
this
time
more
welcome
even
though
among
the
bountiful
corn
beans
and
potatoes
we
came
unexpectedly
upon
fragments
of
the
teeth
and
jaws
of
the
sheep
evidently
in
pampaconas
nothing
is
wasted
we
were
anxious
to
make
an
early
start
for
conservidayoc
but
it
was
first
necessary
for
our
indians
to
prepare
food
for
the
ten
journey
ahead
of
them
guzman
wife
and
i
suppose
the
wives
of
our
other
carriers
spent
the
morning
grinding
chuño
frozen
potatoes
with
a
rocking
stone
pestle
on
a
flat
stone
mortar
and
parching
or
toasting
large
quantities
of
sweet
corn
in
a
olla
with
chuño
and
tostado
the
body
of
the
sheep
and
a
small
quantity
of
coca
leaves
the
indians
professed
themselves
to
be
perfectly
contented
of
our
own
provisions
we
had
so
small
a
quantity
that
we
were
unable
to
spare
any
however
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
indians
would
have
liked
them
as
much
as
the
food
to
which
they
had
long
been
accustomed
toward
noon
all
the
indian
carriers
but
one
having
arrived
and
the
rain
having
partly
subsided
we
started
for
conservidayoc
we
were
told
that
it
would
be
possible
to
use
the
mules
for
this
day
journey
san
fernando
our
first
stop
was
seven
leagues
away
far
down
in
the
densely
wooded
pampaconas
valley
leaving
the
village
we
climbed
up
the
mountain
back
of
guzman
hut
and
followed
a
faint
trail
by
a
dangerous
and
precarious
route
along
the
crest
of
the
ridge
the
rains
had
not
improved
the
path
our
saddle
mules
were
of
little
use
we
had
to
go
nearly
all
the
way
on
foot
owing
to
cold
rain
and
mist
we
could
see
but
little
of
the
deep
canyon
which
opened
below
us
and
into
which
we
now
began
to
descend
through
the
clouds
by
a
very
steep
zigzag
path
four
thousand
feet
to
a
hot
tropical
valley
below
the
clouds
we
found
ourselves
near
a
small
abandoned
clearing
passing
this
and
fording
little
streams
we
went
along
a
very
narrow
path
across
steep
slopes
on
which
maize
had
been
planted
finally
we
came
to
another
little
clearing
and
two
extremely
primitive
little
shanties
mere
shelters
not
deserving
to
be
called
huts
and
this
was
san
fernando
the
end
of
the
mule
trail
there
was
scarcely
room
enough
in
them
for
our
six
carriers
it
was
with
great
difficulty
we
found
and
cleared
a
place
for
our
tent
although
its
floor
was
only
seven
feet
square
there
was
no
really
flat
land
at
all
at
august
while
lying
on
the
ground
in
our
tent
i
noticed
an
earthquake
it
was
felt
also
by
the
indians
in
the
shelter
who
from
force
of
habit
rushed
out
of
their
frail
structure
and
made
a
great
disturbance
crying
out
that
there
was
a
temblor
even
had
their
little
thatched
roof
fallen
upon
them
as
it
might
have
done
during
the
stormy
night
which
followed
they
were
in
no
danger
but
being
accustomed
to
the
stone
walls
and
red
tiled
roofs
of
mountain
villages
where
earthquakes
sometimes
do
very
serious
harm
they
were
greatly
excited
the
motion
seemed
to
me
to
be
like
a
slight
shuffle
from
west
to
east
lasting
three
or
four
seconds
a
gentle
rocking
back
and
forth
with
eight
or
ten
vibrations
several
weeks
later
near
huadquiña
we
happened
to
stop
at
the
colpani
telegraph
office
the
operator
said
he
had
felt
two
shocks
on
august
one
at
five
which
had
shaken
the
books
off
his
table
and
knocked
over
a
box
of
insulators
standing
along
a
wall
which
ran
north
and
south
he
said
the
shock
which
i
had
felt
was
the
lighter
of
the
two
during
the
night
it
rained
hard
but
our
tent
was
now
adjusting
itself
to
the
dry
season
and
we
were
more
comfortable
furthermore
camping
out
at
feet
above
sea
level
is
very
different
from
camping
at
feet
this
elevation
similar
to
that
of
the
bridge
of
san
miguel
below
machu
picchu
is
on
the
lower
edge
of
the
temperate
zone
and
the
beginning
of
the
torrid
tropics
sugar
cane
peppers
bananas
and
grenadillas
grow
here
as
well
as
maize
squashes
and
sweet
potatoes
none
of
these
things
will
grow
at
pampaconas
the
indians
who
raise
sheep
and
white
potatoes
in
that
cold
region
come
to
san
fernando
to
make
chacras
or
small
clearings
the
three
or
four
natives
whom
we
found
here
were
so
alarmed
by
the
sight
of
brass
buttons
that
they
disappeared
during
the
night
rather
than
take
the
chance
of
having
a
silver
dollar
pressed
into
their
hands
in
the
morning
from
san
fernando
we
sent
one
of
our
gendarmes
back
to
pampaconas
with
the
mules
our
carriers
were
good
for
about
fifty
pounds
apiece
half
an
hour
walk
brought
us
to
vista
alegre
another
little
clearing
on
an
alluvial
fan
in
the
bend
of
the
river
the
soil
here
seemed
to
be
very
rich
in
the
chacra
we
saw
corn
stalks
eighteen
feet
in
height
near
a
gigantic
tree
almost
completely
enveloped
in
the
embrace
of
a
or
parasitic
fig
tree
this
clearing
certainly
deserves
its
name
for
it
commands
a
charming
view
of
the
green
pampaconas
valley
opposite
us
rose
abruptly
a
heavily
forested
mountain
whose
summit
was
lost
in
the
clouds
a
mile
above
to
circumvent
this
mountain
the
river
had
been
flowing
in
a
westerly
direction
now
it
gradually
turned
to
the
northward
again
we
were
mystified
for
by
raimondi
map
it
should
have
gone
southward
we
entered
a
dense
jungle
where
the
narrow
path
became
more
and
more
difficult
for
our
carriers
crawling
over
rocks
under
branches
along
slippery
little
cliffs
on
steps
which
had
been
cut
in
earth
or
rock
over
a
trail
which
not
even
dogs
could
follow
unassisted
slowly
we
made
our
way
down
the
valley
owing
to
the
heat
humidity
and
the
frequent
showers
it
was
before
we
reached
another
little
clearing
called
pacaypata
here
on
a
hillside
nearly
a
thousand
feet
above
the
river
our
men
decided
to
spend
the
night
in
a
tiny
little
shelter
six
feet
long
and
five
feet
wide
professor
foote
and
i
had
to
dig
a
shelf
out
of
the
steep
hillside
in
order
to
pitch
our
tent
the
next
morning
not
being
detained
by
the
vagaries
of
a
mule
train
we
made
an
early
start
as
we
followed
the
faint
little
trail
across
the
gulches
tributary
to
the
river
pampaconas
we
had
to
negotiate
several
unusually
steep
descents
and
ascents
the
bearers
suffered
from
the
heat
they
found
it
more
and
more
difficult
to
carry
their
loads
twice
we
had
to
cross
the
rapids
of
the
river
on
primitive
bridges
which
consisted
only
of
a
few
little
logs
lashed
together
and
resting
on
slippery
boulders
by
one
we
found
ourselves
on
a
small
plain
ele
in
dense
woods
surrounded
by
tree
ferns
vines
and
tangled
thickets
through
which
it
was
impossible
to
see
for
more
than
a
few
feet
here
guzman
told
us
we
must
stop
and
rest
a
while
as
we
were
now
in
the
territory
of
los
salvajes
the
savage
indians
who
acknowledged
only
the
rule
of
saavedra
and
resented
all
intrusion
guzman
did
not
seem
to
be
particularly
afraid
but
said
that
we
ought
to
send
ahead
one
of
our
carriers
to
warn
the
savages
that
we
were
coming
on
a
friendly
mission
and
were
not
in
search
of
rubber
gatherers
otherwise
they
might
attack
us
or
run
away
and
disappear
into
the
jungle
he
said
we
should
never
be
able
to
find
the
ruins
without
their
help
the
carrier
who
was
selected
to
go
ahead
did
not
relish
his
task
leaving
his
pack
behind
he
proceeded
very
quietly
and
cautiously
along
the
trail
and
was
lost
to
view
almost
immediately
there
followed
an
exciting
while
we
waited
wondering
what
attitude
the
savages
would
take
toward
us
and
trying
to
picture
to
ourselves
the
mighty
potentate
saavedra
who
had
been
described
as
sitting
in
the
midst
of
savage
luxury
surrounded
by
fifty
servants
and
directing
his
myrmidons
to
checkmate
our
desires
to
visit
the
inca
city
on
the
pampa
of
ghosts
suddenly
we
were
startled
by
the
crackling
of
twigs
and
the
sound
of
a
man
running
we
instinctively
held
our
rifles
a
little
tighter
in
readiness
for
whatever
might
befall
when
there
burst
out
of
the
woods
a
young
peruvian
quite
conventionally
clad
who
had
come
in
haste
from
saavedra
his
father
to
extend
to
us
a
most
cordial
welcome
it
seemed
scarcely
credible
but
a
glance
at
his
face
showed
that
there
was
no
ambush
in
store
for
us
it
was
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
we
realized
there
was
to
be
no
shower
of
poisoned
arrows
from
the
impenetrable
thickets
gathering
up
our
packs
we
continued
along
the
jungle
trail
through
woods
which
gradually
became
higher
deeper
and
darker
until
presently
we
saw
sunlight
ahead
and
to
our
intense
astonishment
the
bright
green
of
waving
sugar
cane
a
few
moments
of
walking
through
the
cane
fields
found
us
at
a
large
comfortable
hut
welcomed
very
simply
and
modestly
by
saavedra
himself
a
more
pleasant
and
peaceable
little
man
it
was
never
my
good
fortune
to
meet
we
looked
furtively
around
for
his
fifty
savage
servants
but
all
we
saw
was
his
indian
wife
three
or
four
small
children
and
a
evidently
the
only
savage
present
saavedra
said
some
called
this
place
jesús
maria
because
they
were
so
surprised
when
they
saw
it
it
is
difficult
to
describe
our
feelings
as
we
accepted
invitation
to
make
ourselves
at
home
and
sat
down
to
an
abundant
meal
of
boiled
chicken
rice
and
sweet
cassava
manioc
saavedra
gave
us
to
understand
that
we
were
not
only
most
welcome
to
anything
he
had
but
that
he
would
do
everything
to
enable
us
to
see
the
ruins
which
were
it
seemed
at
espiritu
pampa
some
distance
farther
down
the
valley
to
be
reached
only
by
a
hard
trail
passable
for
barefooted
savages
but
scarcely
available
for
us
unless
we
chose
to
go
a
good
part
of
the
distance
on
hands
and
knees
the
next
day
while
our
carriers
were
engaged
in
clearing
this
trail
professor
foote
collected
a
large
number
of
insects
including
eight
new
species
of
moths
and
butterflies
i
inspected
saavedra
plantation
the
soil
having
lain
fallow
for
centuries
and
being
rich
in
humus
had
produced
more
sugar
cane
than
he
could
grind
in
addition
to
this
he
had
bananas
coffee
trees
sweet
potatoes
tobacco
and
peanuts
instead
of
being
a
very
powerful
chief
having
many
indians
under
his
control
a
kind
of
he
was
merely
a
pioneer
in
the
utter
wilderness
far
from
any
neighbors
surrounded
by
dense
forests
and
a
few
savages
he
had
established
his
home
he
was
not
an
indian
potentate
but
only
a
frontiersman
and
energetic
an
ingenious
carpenter
and
mechanic
a
modest
peruvian
of
the
best
type
owing
to
the
scarcity
of
arable
land
he
was
obliged
to
cultivate
such
pampas
as
he
could
find
one
an
alluvial
fan
near
his
house
another
a
natural
terrace
near
the
river
back
of
the
house
was
a
thatched
shelter
under
which
he
had
constructed
a
little
sugar
mill
it
had
a
pair
of
hardwood
rollers
each
capable
of
being
turned
with
much
creaking
and
cracking
by
a
large
rustic
wheel
made
of
roughly
hewn
timbers
fastened
together
with
wooden
pins
and
lashed
with
thongs
worked
by
hand
and
foot
power
since
saavedra
had
been
unable
to
coax
any
pack
animals
over
the
trail
to
conservidayoc
he
was
obliged
to
depend
entirely
on
his
own
limited
strength
and
that
of
his
active
son
aided
by
the
uncertain
and
irregular
services
of
such
savages
as
wished
to
work
for
sugar
trinkets
or
other
trade
articles
sometimes
the
savages
seemed
to
enjoy
the
fun
of
climbing
on
the
great
creaking
treadwheel
as
though
it
were
a
game
at
other
times
they
would
disappear
in
the
woods
near
the
mill
were
some
interesting
large
pots
which
saavedra
was
using
in
the
process
of
boiling
the
juice
and
making
crude
sugar
he
said
he
had
found
the
pots
in
the
jungle
not
far
away
they
had
been
made
by
the
incas
four
of
them
were
of
the
familiar
aryballus
type
another
was
of
a
closely
related
form
having
a
wide
mouth
pointed
base
single
incised
conventionalized
nubbin
attached
to
the
shoulder
and
handles
attached
vertically
below
the
median
line
although
capable
of
holding
more
than
ten
gallons
this
huge
pot
was
intended
to
be
carried
on
the
back
and
shoulders
by
means
of
a
rope
passing
through
the
handles
and
around
the
nubbin
saavedra
said
that
he
had
found
near
his
house
several
cists
lined
with
stones
with
a
flat
stone
on
top
evidently
ancient
graves
the
bones
had
entirely
disappeared
the
cover
of
one
of
the
graves
had
been
pierced
the
hole
covered
with
a
thin
sheet
of
beaten
silver
he
had
also
found
a
few
stone
implements
and
two
or
three
small
bronze
inca
axes
on
the
pampa
below
his
house
saavedra
had
constructed
with
infinite
labor
another
sugar
mill
it
seemed
strange
that
he
should
have
taken
the
trouble
to
make
two
mills
but
when
one
remembered
that
he
had
no
pack
animals
and
was
usually
obliged
to
bring
the
cane
to
the
mill
on
his
own
back
and
the
back
of
his
son
one
realized
that
it
was
easier
while
the
cane
was
growing
to
construct
a
new
mill
near
the
cane
field
than
to
have
to
carry
the
heavy
bundles
of
ripe
cane
up
the
hill
he
said
his
hardest
task
was
to
get
money
with
which
to
send
his
children
to
school
in
cuzco
and
to
pay
his
taxes
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
get
any
cash
was
by
making
chancaca
crude
brown
sugar
and
carrying
it
on
his
back
fifty
pounds
at
a
time
three
hard
journey
on
foot
up
the
mountain
to
pampaconas
or
vilcabamba
six
or
seven
thousand
feet
above
his
little
plantation
he
said
he
could
usually
sell
such
a
load
for
five
soles
equivalent
to
two
dollars
and
a
half
his
was
certainly
a
hard
lot
but
he
did
not
complain
although
he
smilingly
admitted
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
keep
the
trail
open
since
the
jungle
grew
so
fast
and
the
floods
in
the
river
continually
washed
away
his
little
rustic
bridges
his
chief
regret
was
that
as
the
result
of
a
recent
revolution
with
which
he
had
had
nothing
to
do
the
government
had
decreed
that
all
firearms
should
be
turned
in
and
so
he
had
lost
the
one
thing
he
needed
to
enable
him
to
get
fresh
meat
in
the
forest
figure
saavedra
and
his
inca
pottery
figure
inca
gable
at
espiritu
pampa
in
the
clearing
near
the
house
we
were
interested
to
see
a
large
bird
the
pava
de
la
montaña
glossy
black
its
most
striking
feature
a
high
coral
red
comb
although
completely
at
liberty
it
seemed
to
be
thoroughly
domesticated
it
would
make
an
attractive
bird
for
introduction
into
our
southern
states
saavedra
gave
us
some
very
black
leaves
of
native
tobacco
which
he
had
cured
an
inveterate
smoker
who
tried
it
in
his
pipe
said
it
was
without
exception
the
strongest
stuff
he
ever
had
encountered
so
interested
did
i
become
in
talking
with
saavedra
seeing
his
plantation
and
marveling
that
he
should
be
worried
about
taxes
and
have
to
obey
regulations
in
regard
to
firearms
i
had
almost
forgotten
about
the
wild
indians
suddenly
our
carriers
ran
toward
the
house
in
a
great
flurry
of
excitement
shouting
that
there
was
a
savage
in
the
bushes
near
by
the
wild
man
was
very
timid
but
curiosity
finally
got
the
better
of
fear
and
he
summoned
up
sufficient
courage
to
accept
saavedra
urgent
invitation
that
he
come
out
and
meet
us
he
proved
to
be
a
miserable
specimen
suffering
from
a
very
bad
cold
in
his
head
it
has
been
my
good
fortune
at
one
time
or
another
to
meet
primitive
folk
in
various
parts
of
america
and
the
pacific
but
this
man
was
by
far
the
dirtiest
and
most
wretched
savage
that
i
have
ever
seen
he
was
dressed
in
a
long
filthy
tunic
which
came
nearly
to
his
ankles
it
was
made
of
a
large
square
of
coarsely
woven
cotton
cloth
with
a
hole
in
the
middle
for
his
head
the
sides
were
stitched
up
leaving
holes
for
the
arms
his
hair
was
long
unkempt
and
matted
he
had
small
eyes
cadaverous
cheeks
thick
lips
and
a
large
mouth
his
big
toes
were
unusually
long
and
prehensile
slung
over
one
shoulder
he
carried
a
small
knapsack
made
of
coarse
fiber
net
around
his
neck
hung
what
at
first
sight
seemed
to
be
a
necklace
composed
of
a
dozen
stout
cords
securely
knotted
together
although
i
did
not
see
it
in
use
i
was
given
to
understand
that
when
climbing
trees
he
used
this
stout
loop
to
fasten
his
ankles
together
and
thus
secure
a
tighter
grip
for
his
feet
by
evening
two
other
savages
had
come
in
a
young
married
man
and
his
little
sister
both
had
bad
colds
saavedra
told
us
that
these
indians
were
pichanguerras
a
subdivision
of
the
campa
tribe
saavedra
and
his
son
spoke
a
little
of
their
language
which
sounded
to
our
unaccustomed
ears
like
a
succession
of
low
grunts
breathings
and
gutturals
it
was
pieced
out
by
signs
the
long
tunics
worn
by
the
men
indicated
that
they
had
one
or
more
wives
before
marrying
they
wear
very
scanty
attire
nothing
more
than
a
few
rags
hanging
over
one
shoulder
and
tied
about
the
waist
the
long
tunic
a
comfortable
enough
garment
to
wear
during
the
cold
nights
and
their
only
covering
must
impede
their
progress
in
the
jungle
yet
they
live
partly
by
hunting
using
bows
and
arrows
we
learned
that
these
pichanguerras
had
run
away
from
the
rubber
country
in
the
lower
valleys
that
they
found
it
uncomfortably
cold
at
this
altitude
feet
but
preferred
freedom
in
the
higher
valleys
to
serfdom
on
a
rubber
estate
saavedra
said
that
he
had
named
his
plantation
conservidayoc
because
it
was
in
truth
a
spot
where
one
may
be
preserved
from
harm
such
was
the
home
of
the
potentate
from
whose
abode
no
one
had
been
known
to
return
alive
chapter
xv
the
pampa
of
ghosts
two
days
later
we
left
conservidayoc
for
espiritu
pampa
by
the
trail
which
saavedra
son
and
our
pampaconas
indians
had
been
clearing
we
emerged
from
the
thickets
near
a
promontory
where
there
was
a
fine
view
down
the
valley
and
particularly
of
a
heavily
wooded
alluvial
fan
just
below
us
in
it
were
two
or
three
small
clearings
and
the
little
oval
huts
of
the
savages
of
espiritu
pampa
the
pampa
of
ghosts
on
top
of
the
promontory
was
the
ruin
of
a
small
rectangular
building
of
rough
stone
once
probably
an
inca
from
here
to
espiritu
pampa
our
trail
followed
an
ancient
stone
stairway
about
four
feet
in
width
and
nearly
a
third
of
a
mile
long
it
was
built
of
uncut
stones
possibly
it
was
the
work
of
those
soldiers
whose
chief
duty
it
was
to
watch
from
the
top
of
the
promontory
and
who
used
their
spare
time
making
roads
we
arrived
at
the
principal
clearing
just
as
a
heavy
began
the
huts
were
empty
obviously
their
occupants
had
seen
us
coming
and
had
disappeared
in
the
jungle
we
hesitated
to
enter
the
home
of
a
savage
without
an
invitation
but
the
terrific
downpour
overcame
our
scruples
if
not
our
nervousness
the
hut
had
a
steeply
pitched
roof
its
sides
were
made
of
small
logs
driven
endwise
into
the
ground
and
fastened
together
with
vines
a
small
fire
had
been
burning
on
the
ground
near
the
embers
were
two
old
black
ollas
of
inca
origin
in
the
little
chacra
cassava
coca
and
sweet
potatoes
were
growing
in
haphazard
fashion
among
charred
and
fallen
tree
trunks
a
typical
milpa
farm
in
the
clearing
were
the
ruins
of
eighteen
or
twenty
circular
houses
arranged
in
an
irregular
group
we
wondered
if
this
could
be
the
inca
city
which
lopez
torres
had
reported
among
the
ruins
we
picked
up
several
fragments
of
inca
pottery
there
was
nothing
incaic
about
the
buildings
one
was
rectangular
and
one
was
but
all
the
rest
were
round
the
buildings
varied
in
diameter
from
fifteen
to
twenty
feet
each
had
but
a
single
opening
the
walls
had
tumbled
down
but
gave
no
evidence
of
careful
construction
not
far
away
in
woods
which
had
not
yet
been
cleared
by
the
savages
we
found
other
circular
walls
they
were
still
standing
to
a
height
of
about
four
feet
if
the
savages
have
extended
their
milpa
clearings
since
our
visit
the
falling
trees
have
probably
spoiled
these
walls
by
now
the
ancient
village
probably
belonged
to
a
tribe
which
acknowledged
allegiance
to
the
incas
but
the
architecture
of
the
buildings
gave
no
indication
of
their
having
been
constructed
by
the
incas
themselves
we
began
to
wonder
whether
the
pampa
of
ghosts
really
had
anything
important
in
store
for
us
undoubtedly
this
alluvial
fan
had
been
highly
prized
in
this
country
of
terribly
steep
hills
it
must
have
been
inhabited
off
and
on
for
many
centuries
yet
this
was
not
an
inca
city
while
we
were
wondering
whether
the
incas
themselves
ever
lived
here
there
suddenly
appeared
the
naked
figure
of
a
sturdy
young
savage
armed
with
a
stout
bow
and
long
arrows
and
wearing
a
fillet
of
bamboo
he
had
been
hunting
and
showed
us
a
bird
he
had
shot
soon
afterwards
there
came
the
two
adult
savages
we
had
met
at
saavedra
accompanied
by
a
friend
all
wearing
long
tunics
they
offered
to
guide
us
to
other
ruins
it
was
very
difficult
for
us
to
follow
their
rapid
pace
half
an
hour
scramble
through
the
jungle
brought
us
to
a
pampa
or
natural
terrace
on
the
banks
of
a
little
tributary
of
the
pampaconas
they
called
it
eromboni
here
we
found
several
old
artificial
terraces
and
the
rough
foundations
of
a
long
rectangular
building
feet
by
feet
it
might
have
had
doors
twelve
in
front
and
twelve
in
back
each
three
and
a
half
feet
wide
no
lintels
were
in
evidence
the
walls
were
only
a
foot
high
there
was
very
little
building
material
in
sight
apparently
the
structure
had
never
been
completed
near
by
was
a
typical
inca
fountain
with
three
stone
spouts
or
conduits
two
hundred
yards
beyond
the
rendezvous
hidden
behind
a
curtain
of
hanging
vines
and
thickets
so
dense
we
could
not
see
more
than
a
few
feet
in
any
direction
the
savages
showed
us
the
ruins
of
a
group
of
stone
houses
whose
walls
were
still
standing
in
fine
condition
figure
ruins
in
the
jungles
of
espiritu
pampa
one
of
the
buildings
was
rounded
at
one
end
another
standing
by
itself
at
the
south
end
of
a
little
pampa
had
neither
doors
nor
windows
it
was
rectangular
its
four
or
five
niches
were
arranged
with
unique
irregularity
furthermore
they
were
two
feet
deep
an
unusual
dimension
probably
this
was
a
storehouse
on
the
east
side
of
the
pampa
was
a
structure
feet
long
by
feet
wide
divided
into
five
rooms
of
unequal
size
the
walls
were
of
rough
stones
laid
in
adobe
like
some
of
the
inca
buildings
at
ollantaytambo
the
lintels
of
the
doors
were
made
of
three
or
four
narrow
uncut
ashlars
some
rooms
had
niches
on
the
north
side
of
the
pampa
was
another
rectangular
building
on
the
west
side
was
the
edge
of
a
terrace
below
it
was
a
partly
enclosed
fountain
or
bathhouse
with
a
stone
spout
and
a
basin
the
shapes
of
the
houses
their
general
arrangement
the
niches
stone
and
lintels
all
point
to
inca
builders
in
the
buildings
we
picked
up
several
fragments
of
inca
pottery
equally
interesting
and
very
puzzling
were
half
a
dozen
crude
spanish
roofing
tiles
baked
red
all
the
pieces
and
fragments
we
could
find
would
not
have
covered
four
square
feet
they
were
of
widely
different
sizes
as
though
some
one
had
been
experimenting
perhaps
an
inca
who
had
seen
the
new
red
tiled
roofs
of
cuzco
had
tried
to
reproduce
them
here
in
the
jungle
but
without
success
at
dusk
we
all
returned
to
espiritu
pampa
our
faces
hands
and
clothes
had
been
torn
by
the
jungle
our
feet
were
weary
and
sore
nevertheless
the
day
work
had
been
very
satisfactory
and
we
prepared
to
enjoy
a
good
night
rest
alas
we
were
doomed
to
disappointment
during
the
day
some
one
had
brought
to
the
hut
eight
tame
but
noisy
macaws
furthermore
our
savage
helpers
determined
to
make
the
night
hideous
with
cries
and
drums
either
to
discourage
the
visits
of
hostile
indians
or
jaguars
or
for
the
purpose
of
exorcising
the
demons
brought
by
the
white
men
or
else
to
cheer
up
their
families
who
were
undoubtedly
hiding
in
the
jungle
near
by
the
next
day
the
savages
and
our
carriers
continued
to
clear
away
as
much
as
possible
of
the
tangled
growth
near
the
best
ruins
in
this
process
to
the
intense
surprise
not
only
of
ourselves
but
also
of
the
savages
they
discovered
just
below
the
bathhouse
where
we
had
stood
the
day
before
the
ruins
of
two
buildings
of
superior
construction
well
fitted
with
and
numerous
niches
very
symmetrically
arranged
these
houses
stood
by
themselves
on
a
little
artificial
terrace
fragments
of
characteristic
inca
pottery
were
found
on
the
floor
including
pieces
of
a
large
aryballus
nothing
gives
a
better
idea
of
the
density
of
the
jungle
than
the
fact
that
the
savages
themselves
had
often
been
within
five
feet
of
these
fine
walls
without
being
aware
of
their
existence
encouraged
by
this
important
discovery
of
the
most
characteristic
inca
ruins
found
in
the
valley
we
continued
the
search
but
all
that
any
one
was
able
to
find
was
a
carefully
built
stone
bridge
over
a
brook
saavedra
son
questioned
the
savages
carefully
they
said
they
knew
of
no
other
antiquities
who
built
the
stone
buildings
of
espiritu
pampa
and
eromboni
pampa
was
this
the
vilcabamba
viejo
of
father
calancha
that
university
of
idolatry
where
lived
the
teachers
who
were
wizards
and
masters
of
abomination
the
place
to
which
friar
marcos
and
friar
diego
went
with
so
much
suffering
was
there
formerly
on
this
trail
a
place
called
ungacacha
where
the
monks
had
to
wade
and
amused
titu
cusi
by
the
way
they
handled
their
monastic
robes
in
the
water
they
called
it
a
three
days
journey
over
rough
country
another
reference
in
father
calancha
speaks
of
puquiura
as
being
two
long
days
journey
from
vilcabamba
it
took
us
five
days
to
go
from
espiritu
pampa
to
pucyura
although
indians
unencumbered
by
burdens
and
spurred
on
by
necessity
might
do
it
in
three
it
is
possible
to
fit
some
other
details
of
the
story
into
this
locality
although
there
is
no
place
on
the
road
called
ungacacha
nevertheless
it
does
not
seem
to
me
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
priests
and
virgins
of
the
sun
the
personnel
of
the
university
of
idolatry
who
fled
from
cold
cuzco
with
manco
and
were
established
by
him
somewhere
in
the
fastnesses
of
uilcapampa
would
have
cared
to
live
in
the
hot
valley
of
espiritu
pampa
the
difference
in
climate
is
as
great
as
that
between
scotland
and
egypt
or
new
york
and
havana
they
would
not
have
found
in
espiritu
pampa
the
food
which
they
liked
furthermore
they
could
have
found
the
seclusion
and
safety
which
they
craved
just
as
well
in
several
other
parts
of
the
province
particularly
at
machu
picchu
together
with
a
cool
bracing
climate
and
more
nearly
resembling
those
to
which
they
were
accustomed
finally
calancha
says
vilcabamba
the
old
was
the
largest
city
in
the
province
a
term
far
more
applicable
to
machu
picchu
or
even
to
choqquequirau
than
to
espiritu
pampa
on
the
other
hand
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
espiritu
pampa
in
the
montaña
does
meet
the
requirements
of
the
place
called
vilcabamba
by
the
companions
of
captain
garcia
they
speak
of
it
as
the
town
and
valley
to
which
tupac
amaru
the
last
inca
escaped
after
his
forces
lost
the
young
fortress
of
uiticos
ocampo
doubtless
wishing
to
emphasize
the
difference
between
it
and
his
own
metropolis
the
spanish
town
of
vilcabamba
calls
the
refuge
of
tupac
vilcabamba
the
old
ocampo
new
vilcabamba
was
not
in
existence
when
friar
marcos
and
friar
diego
lived
in
this
province
if
calancha
wrote
his
chronicles
from
their
notes
the
term
old
would
not
apply
to
espiritu
pampa
but
to
an
older
vilcabamba
than
either
of
the
places
known
to
ocampo
the
ruins
are
of
late
inca
pattern
not
of
a
kind
which
would
have
required
a
long
period
to
build
the
unfinished
building
may
have
been
under
construction
during
the
latter
part
of
the
reign
of
titu
cusi
it
was
titu
cusi
desire
that
rodriguez
de
figueroa
should
meet
him
at
pampaconas
the
inca
evidently
came
from
a
vilcabamba
down
in
the
montaña
and
as
has
been
said
brought
rodriguez
a
present
of
a
macaw
and
two
hampers
of
peanuts
articles
of
trade
still
common
at
conservidayoc
there
appears
to
me
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
ruins
of
espiritu
pampa
are
those
of
one
of
the
favorite
residences
of
this
inca
the
very
vilcabamba
in
fact
where
he
spent
his
boyhood
and
from
which
he
journeyed
to
meet
rodriguez
in
in
when
captain
garcia
took
up
the
pursuit
of
tupac
amaru
after
the
victory
of
vilcabamba
the
inca
fled
inland
toward
the
valley
of
to
the
country
of
the
mañaries
indians
a
warlike
tribe
and
his
friends
where
balsas
and
canoes
were
posted
to
save
him
and
enable
him
to
escape
there
is
now
no
valley
in
this
vicinity
called
simaponte
so
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
discover
the
mañaries
indians
are
said
to
have
lived
on
the
banks
of
the
lower
urubamba
in
order
to
reach
their
country
tupac
amaru
probably
went
down
the
pampaconas
from
espiritu
pampa
from
the
pampa
of
ghosts
to
canoe
navigation
would
have
been
but
a
short
journey
evidently
his
friends
who
helped
him
to
escape
were
captain
garcia
gives
an
account
of
the
pursuit
of
tupac
amaru
in
which
he
says
that
not
deterred
by
the
dangers
of
the
jungle
or
the
river
he
constructed
five
rafts
on
which
he
put
some
of
his
soldiers
and
accompanying
them
himself
went
down
the
rapids
escaping
death
many
times
by
swimming
until
he
arrived
at
a
place
called
momori
only
to
find
that
the
inca
learning
of
his
approach
had
gone
farther
into
the
woods
nothing
daunted
garcia
followed
him
although
he
and
his
men
now
had
to
go
on
foot
and
barefooted
with
hardly
anything
to
eat
most
of
their
provisions
having
been
lost
in
the
river
until
they
finally
caught
tupac
and
his
friends
a
tragic
ending
to
a
terrible
chase
hard
on
the
white
man
and
fatal
for
the
incas
it
was
with
great
regret
that
i
was
now
unable
to
follow
the
pampaconas
river
to
its
junction
with
the
urubamba
it
seemed
possible
that
the
pampaconas
might
be
known
as
the
sirialo
or
the
both
of
which
were
believed
by
dr
bowman
to
rise
in
the
mountains
of
vilcabamba
it
was
not
however
until
the
summer
of
that
we
were
able
definitely
to
learn
that
the
pampaconas
was
really
a
branch
of
the
cosireni
it
seems
likely
that
the
cosireni
was
once
called
the
whether
the
comberciato

the
momori

hard
to
say
to
be
the
next
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
tupac
amaru
and
captain
garcia
was
the
privilege
of
heller
ford
and
maynard
they
found
that
the
unpleasant
features
had
not
been
exaggerated
they
were
tormented
by
insects
and
great
quantities
of
ants
a
small
red
ant
found
on
tree
trunks
and
a
large
black
one
about
an
inch
in
length
frequently
seen
among
the
leaves
on
the
ground
the
bite
of
the
red
ant
caused
a
stinging
and
burning
for
about
fifteen
minutes
one
of
their
carriers
who
was
bitten
in
the
foot
by
a
black
ant
suffered
intense
pain
for
a
number
of
hours
not
only
his
foot
but
also
his
leg
and
hip
were
affected
the
savages
were
both
fishermen
and
hunters
the
fish
being
taken
with
nets
the
game
killed
with
bows
and
arrows
peccaries
were
shot
from
a
blind
made
of
palm
leaves
a
few
feet
from
a
runway
fishing
brought
rather
meager
results
three
indians
fished
all
night
and
caught
only
one
fish
a
perch
weighing
about
four
pounds
the
temperature
was
so
high
that
candles
could
easily
be
tied
in
knots
excessive
humidity
caused
all
leather
articles
to
become
blue
with
mould
clouds
of
flies
and
mosquitoes
increased
the
likelihood
of
spreading
communicable
jungle
fevers
the
river
comberciato
was
reached
by
heller
at
a
point
not
more
than
a
league
from
its
junction
with
the
urubamba
the
lower
course
of
the
comberciato
is
not
considered
dangerous
to
canoe
navigation
but
the
valley
is
much
narrower
than
the
cosireni
the
width
of
the
river
is
about
feet
and
its
volume
is
twice
that
of
the
cosireni
the
climate
is
very
trying
the
nights
are
hot
insect
pests
are
numerous
heller
found
that
the
forest
was
filled
with
annoying
though
bees
which
persisted
in
attempting
to
roost
on
the
countenance
of
any
human
being
available
on
the
banks
of
the
comberciato
he
found
several
families
of
savages
all
the
men
were
keen
hunters
and
fishermen
their
weapons
consisted
of
powerful
bows
made
from
the
wood
of
a
small
palm
and
long
arrows
made
of
reeds
and
finished
with
feathers
arranged
in
a
spiral
monkeys
were
abundant
specimens
of
six
distinct
genera
were
found
including
the
large
red
howler
inert
and
easily
located
by
its
deep
roaring
bellow
which
can
be
heard
for
a
distance
of
several
miles
the
giant
black
spider
monkey
very
alert
and
when
frightened
fairly
flying
through
the
branches
at
astonishing
speed
and
a
woolly
monkey
black
in
color
and
very
intelligent
in
expression
frequently
tamed
by
the
savages
who
enjoy
having
them
as
pets
but
are
not
averse
to
eating
them
when
food
is
scarce
the
flesh
of
monkeys
is
greatly
appreciated
by
these
indians
who
preserved
what
they
did
not
require
for
immediate
needs
by
drying
it
over
the
smoke
of
a
wood
fire
on
the
cosireni
maynard
noticed
that
one
of
his
indian
guides
carried
a
package
wrapped
in
leaves
which
on
being
opened
proved
to
contain
forty
or
fifty
large
hairless
grubs
or
caterpillars
the
man
finally
bit
their
heads
off
and
threw
the
bodies
into
a
small
bag
saying
that
the
grubs
were
considered
a
great
delicacy
by
the
savages
the
indians
we
met
at
espiritu
pampa
closely
resembled
those
seen
in
the
lower
valley
all
our
savages
were
bareheaded
and
barefooted
they
live
so
much
in
the
shelter
of
the
jungle
that
hats
are
not
necessary
sandals
or
shoes
would
only
make
it
harder
to
use
the
slippery
little
trails
they
had
seen
no
strangers
penetrate
this
valley
for
about
ten
years
and
at
first
kept
their
wives
and
children
well
secluded
later
when
hendriksen
and
tucker
were
sent
here
to
determine
the
astronomical
position
of
espiritu
pampa
the
savages
permitted
tucker
to
take
photographs
of
their
families
perhaps
it
is
doubtful
whether
they
knew
just
what
he
was
doing
at
all
events
they
did
not
run
away
and
hide
figure
campa
men
at
espiritu
pampa
figure
campa
women
and
children
at
espiritu
pampa
all
the
men
and
older
boys
wore
white
fillets
of
bamboo
the
married
men
had
smeared
paint
on
their
faces
and
one
of
them
was
wearing
the
characteristic
lip
ornament
of
the
campas
some
of
the
children
wore
no
clothing
at
all
two
of
the
wives
wore
long
tunics
like
the
men
one
of
them
had
a
truly
savage
face
daubed
with
paint
she
wore
no
fillet
had
the
best
tunic
and
wore
a
handsome
necklace
made
of
seeds
and
the
skins
of
small
birds
of
brilliant
plumage
a
work
of
art
which
must
have
cost
infinite
pains
and
the
loss
of
not
a
few
arrows
all
the
women
carried
babies
in
little
hammocks
slung
over
the
shoulder
one
little
girl
not
more
than
six
years
old
was
carrying
on
her
back
a
child
of
two
in
a
hammock
supported
from
her
head
by
a
it
will
be
remembered
that
forest
indians
nearly
always
use
so
as
to
allow
their
hands
free
play
one
of
the
wives
was
fairer
than
the
others
and
looked
as
though
she
might
have
had
a
spanish
ancestor
the
most
of
the
women
was
very
scantily
clad
wore
a
necklace
of
seeds
a
white
lip
ornament
and
a
few
rags
tied
around
her
waist
all
her
children
were
naked
the
children
of
the
woman
with
the
handsome
necklace
were
clothed
in
pieces
of
old
tunics
and
one
of
them
evidently
her
mother
favorite
was
decorated
with
bird
skins
and
a
necklace
made
from
the
teeth
of
monkeys
such
were
the
people
among
whom
tupac
amaru
took
refuge
when
he
fled
from
vilcabamba
whether
he
partook
of
such
a
delicacy
as
monkey
meat
which
all
amazonian
indians
relish
but
which
is
not
eaten
by
the
highlanders
may
be
doubted
garcilasso
speaks
of
tupac
preferring
to
entrust
himself
to
the
hands
of
the
spaniards
rather
than
to
perish
of
famine
his
indian
allies
lived
perfectly
well
in
a
region
where
monkeys
abound
it
is
doubtful
whether
they
would
ever
have
permitted
captain
garcia
to
capture
the
inca
had
they
been
able
to
furnish
tupac
with
such
food
as
he
was
accustomed
to
at
all
events
our
investigations
seem
to
point
to
the
probability
of
this
valley
having
been
an
important
part
of
the
domain
of
the
last
incas
it
would
have
been
pleasant
to
prolong
our
studies
but
the
carriers
were
anxious
to
return
to
pampaconas
although
they
did
not
have
to
eat
monkey
meat
they
were
afraid
of
the
savages
and
nervous
as
to
what
use
the
latter
might
some
day
make
of
the
powerful
bows
and
long
arrows
at
conservidayoc
saavedra
kindly
took
the
trouble
to
make
some
sugar
for
us
he
poured
the
syrup
in
oblong
moulds
cut
in
a
row
along
the
side
of
a
big
log
of
hard
wood
in
some
of
the
moulds
his
son
placed
handfuls
of
nicely
roasted
peanuts
the
result
was
a
confection
or
emergency
ration
which
we
greatly
enjoyed
on
our
return
journey
at
san
fernando
we
met
the
pack
mules
the
next
day
in
the
midst
of
continuing
torrential
tropical
downpours
we
climbed
out
of
the
hot
valley
to
the
cold
heights
of
pampaconas
we
were
soaked
with
perspiration
and
drenched
with
rain
snow
had
been
falling
above
the
village
our
teeth
chattered
like
castanets
professor
foote
immediately
commandeered
guzman
fire
and
filled
our
tea
kettle
it
may
be
doubted
whether
a
more
wretched
cold
wet
and
bedraggled
party
ever
arrived
at
guzman
hut
certainly
nothing
ever
tasted
better
than
that
steaming

chapter
xvi
the
story
of
a
lost
city
of
the
first
incas
it
will
be
remembered
that
while
on
the
search
for
the
capital
of
the
last
incas
we
had
found
several
groups
of
ruins
which
we
could
not
fit
entirely
into
the
story
of
manco
and
his
sons
the
most
important
of
these
was
machu
picchu
many
of
its
buildings
are
far
older
than
the
ruins
of
rosaspata
and
espiritu
pampa
to
understand
just
what
we
may
have
found
at
machu
picchu
it
is
now
necessary
to
tell
the
story
of
a
celebrated
city
whose
name
was
not
used
even
at
the
time
of
the
spanish
conquest
as
the
cognomen
of
any
of
the
inca
towns
then
in
existence
i
must
draw
the
reader
attention
far
away
from
the
period
when
pizarro
and
manco
toledo
and
tupac
amaru
were
the
protagonists
back
to
events
which
occurred
nearly
seven
hundred
years
before
their
day
the
last
incas
ruled
in
uiticos
between
and
the
last
amautas
flourished
about
figure
puma
urco
near
paccaritampu
the
amautas
had
been
ruling
the
peruvian
highlands
for
about
sixty
generations
when
as
has
been
told
in
chapter
vi
invaders
came
from
the
south
and
east
the
amautas
had
built
up
a
wonderful
civilization
many
of
the
agricultural
and
engineering
feats
which
we
ordinarily
assign
to
the
incas
were
really
achievements
of
the
amautas
the
last
of
the
amautas
was
pachacuti
vi
who
was
killed
by
an
arrow
on
the
of
la
raya
the
historian
montesinos
whose
work
on
the
antiquities
of
peru
has
recently
been
translated
for
the
hakluyt
society
by
a
means
of
harvard
university
tells
us
that
the
followers
of
pachacuti
vi
fled
with
his
body
to
this
says
the
historian
was
a
healthy
place
where
there
was
a
cave
in
which
they
hid
the
amauta
body
cuzco
the
finest
and
most
important
of
all
their
cities
was
sacked
general
anarchy
prevailed
throughout
the
ancient
empire
the
good
old
days
of
peace
and
plenty
disappeared
before
the
invader
the
glory
of
the
old
empire
was
destroyed
not
to
return
for
several
centuries
in
these
dark
ages
resembling
those
of
european
medieval
times
which
followed
the
germanic
migrations
and
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
peru
was
split
up
into
a
large
number
of
small
independent
units
each
district
chose
its
own
ruler
and
carried
on
depredations
against
its
neighbors
the
effects
of
this
may
still
be
seen
in
the
ruins
of
small
fortresses
found
guarding
the
way
into
isolated
andean
valleys
montesinos
says
that
those
who
were
most
loyal
to
the
amautas
were
few
in
number
and
not
strong
enough
to
oppose
their
enemies
successfully
some
of
them
probably
the
principal
priests
wise
men
and
chiefs
of
the
ancient
régime
built
a
new
city
at
here
they
kept
alive
the
memory
of
the
amautas
and
lived
in
such
a
relatively
civilized
manner
as
to
draw
to
them
little
by
little
those
who
wished
to
be
safe
from
the
prevailing
chaos
and
disorder
and
the
tyranny
of
the
independent
chiefs
or
robber
barons
in
their
new
capital
they
elected
a
king
titi
truaman
quicho
the
survivors
of
the
old
régime
enjoyed
living
at
because
there
never
have
been
any
earthquakes
plagues
or
tremblings
there
furthermore
if
fortune
should
turn
against
their
new
young
king
titi
truaman
and
he
should
be
killed
they
could
bury
him
in
a
very
sacred
place
namely
the
cave
where
they
hid
the
body
of
pachacuti
vi
fortune
was
kind
to
the
founders
of
the
new
kingdom
they
had
chosen
an
excellent
place
of
refuge
where
they
were
not
disturbed
to
their
ruler
the
king
of
and
to
his
successors
nothing
worth
recording
happened
for
centuries
during
this
period
several
of
the
kings
wished
to
establish
themselves
in
ancient
cuzco
where
the
great
amautas
had
reigned
but
for
one
reason
or
another
were
obliged
to
forego
their
ambitions
one
of
the
most
enlightened
rulers
of
was
a
king
called
tupac
cauri
or
pachacuti
vii
in
his
day
people
began
to
write
on
the
leaves
of
trees
he
sent
messengers
to
the
various
parts
of
the
highlands
asking
the
tribes
to
stop
worshiping
idols
and
animals
to
cease
practicing
evil
customs
which
had
grown
up
since
the
fall
of
the
amautas
and
to
return
to
the
ways
of
their
ancestors
he
met
with
little
encouragement
on
the
contrary
his
ambassadors
were
killed
and
little
or
no
change
took
place
discouraged
by
the
failure
of
his
attempts
at
reformation
and
desirous
of
learning
its
cause
tupac
cauri
was
told
by
his
soothsayers
that
the
matter
which
most
displeased
the
gods
was
the
invention
of
writing
thereupon
he
forbade
anybody
to
practice
writing
under
penalty
of
death
this
mandate
was
observed
with
such
strictness
that
the
ancient
folk
never
again
used
letters
instead
they
used
quipus
strings
and
knots
it
was
supposed
that
the
gods
were
appeased
and
every
one
breathed
easier
no
one
realized
how
near
the
peruvians
as
a
race
had
come
to
taking
a
most
momentous
step
this
curious
and
interesting
tradition
relates
to
an
event
supposed
to
have
occurred
many
centuries
before
the
spanish
conquest
we
have
no
ocular
evidence
to
support
it
the
skeptic
may
brush
it
aside
as
a
story
intended
to
appeal
to
the
vanity
of
persons
with
inca
blood
in
their
veins
yet
it
is
not
told
by
the
garcilasso
who
wanted
europeans
to
admire
his
maternal
ancestors
and
wrote
his
book
accordingly
but
is
in
the
pages
of
that
careful
investigator
montesinos
a
spaniard
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
students
of
sumner
folkways
the
story
rings
true
some
young
fellow
brighter
than
the
rest
developed
a
system
of
ideographs
which
he
scratched
on
broad
smooth
leaves
it
worked
people
were
beginning
to
adopt
it
the
conservative
priests
of
did
not
like
it
there
was
danger
lest
some
of
the
precious
secrets
heretofore
handed
down
orally
to
the
neophytes
might
become
public
property
nevertheless
the
invention
was
so
useful
that
it
began
to
spread
there
followed
some
extremely
unlucky
event
the
ambassadors
were
killed
the
king
plans
miscarried
what
more
natural
than
that
the
newly
discovered
ideographs
should
be
blamed
for
it
as
a
result
the
king
of
instigated
thereto
by
the
priests
determined
to
abolish
this
new
thing
its
usefulness
had
not
yet
been
firmly
established
in
fact
it
was
inconvenient
the
leaves
withered
dried
and
cracked
or
blew
away
and
the
writings
were
lost
had
the
new
invention
been
permitted
to
exist
a
little
longer
some
one
would
have
commenced
to
scratch
ideographs
on
rocks
then
it
would
have
persisted
the
rulers
and
priests
however
found
that
the
important
records
of
tribute
and
taxes
could
be
kept
perfectly
well
by
means
of
the
quipus
and
the
job
of
those
whose
duty
it
was
to
remember
what
each
string
stood
for
was
assured
after
all
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
montesinos
story
one
has
only
to
look
at
the
history
of
spain
itself
to
realize
that
royal
bigotry
and
priestly
intolerance
have
often
crushed
new
ideas
and
kept
great
nations
from
making
important
advances
montesinos
says
further
that
tupac
cauri
established
in
a
kind
of
university
where
boys
were
taught
the
use
of
quipus
the
method
of
counting
and
the
significance
of
the
different
colored
strings
while
their
fathers
and
older
brothers
were
trained
in
military
exercises
in
other
words
practiced
with
the
sling
the
bolas
and
the
perhaps
also
with
bows
and
arrows
around
the
name
of
tupac
cauri
or
pachacuti
vii
as
he
wished
to
be
called
is
gathered
the
story
of
various
intellectual
movements
which
took
place
in
finally
there
came
a
time
when
the
skill
and
military
efficiency
of
the
little
kingdom
rose
to
a
high
plane
the
ruler
and
his
councilors
bearing
in
mind
the
tradition
of
their
ancestors
who
centuries
before
had
dwelt
in
cuzco
again
determined
to
make
the
attempt
to
reestablish
themselves
there
an
earthquake
which
ruined
many
buildings
in
cuzco
caused
rivers
to
change
their
courses
destroyed
towns
and
was
followed
by
the
outbreak
of
a
disastrous
epidemic
the
chiefs
were
obliged
to
give
up
their
plans
although
in
healthy
there
was
no
pestilence
their
kingdom
became
more
and
more
crowded
every
available
square
yard
of
arable
land
was
terraced
and
cultivated
the
men
were
intelligent
well
organized
and
accustomed
to
discipline
but
they
could
not
raise
enough
food
for
their
families
so
about
they
were
forced
to
secure
arable
land
by
conquest
under
the
leadership
of
the
energetic
ruler
of
the
day
his
name
was
manco
ccapac
generally
called
the
first
inca
the
ruler
for
whom
the
manco
of
was
named
there
are
many
stories
of
the
rise
of
the
first
inca
when
he
had
grown
to
man
estate
he
assembled
his
people
to
see
how
he
could
secure
new
lands
for
them
after
consultation
with
his
brothers
he
determined
to
set
out
with
them
toward
the
hill
over
which
the
sun
rose
as
we
are
informed
by
pachacuti
yamqui
salcamayhua
an
indian
who
was
a
descendant
of
a
long
line
of
incas
whose
lived
in
the
time
of
the
spanish
conquest
and
who
wrote
an
account
of
the
antiquities
of
peru
in
he
gives
the
history
of
the
incas
as
it
was
handed
down
to
the
descendants
of
the
former
rulers
of
peru
in
it
we
read
that
manco
ccapac
and
his
brothers
finally
succeeded
in
reaching
cuzco
and
settled
there
with
the
return
of
the
descendants
of
the
amautas
to
cuzco
there
ended
the
glory
of
manco
married
his
own
sister
in
order
that
he
might
not
lose
caste
and
that
no
other
family
be
elevated
by
this
marriage
to
be
on
an
equality
with
his
he
made
good
laws
conquered
many
provinces
and
is
regarded
as
the
founder
of
the
inca
dynasty
the
highlanders
came
under
his
sway
and
brought
him
rich
presents
the
inca
as
manco
ccapac
now
came
to
be
known
was
recognized
as
the
most
powerful
chief
the
most
valiant
fighter
and
the
most
lucky
warrior
in
the
andes
his
captains
and
soldiers
were
brave
well
disciplined
and
well
armed
all
his
affairs
prospered
greatly
afterward
he
ordered
works
to
be
executed
at
the
place
of
his
birth
consisting
of
a
masonry
wall
with
three
windows
which
were
emblems
of
the
house
of
his
fathers
whence
he
descended
the
first
window
was
called

from

the
best

maucallacta
near
paccaritampu
figure
the
caves
of
puma
urco
near
paccaritampu
the
spaniards
who
asked
about
were
told
that
it
was
at
or
near
paccaritampu
a
small
town
eight
or
ten
miles
south
of
cuzco
i
learned
that
ruins
are
very
scarce
in
its
vicinity
there
are
none
in
the
town
the
most
important
are
the
ruins
of
maucallacta
an
inca
village
a
few
miles
away
near
it
i
found
a
rocky
hill
consisting
of
several
crags
and
large
rocks
the
surface
of
one
of
which
is
carved
into
platforms
and
two
sleeping
pumas
it
is
called
puma
urco
beneath
the
rocks
are
some
caves
i
was
told
they
had
recently
been
used
by
political
refugees
there
is
enough
about
the
caves
and
the
characteristics
of
the
ruins
near
paccaritampu
to
lend
color
to
the
story
told
to
the
early
spaniards
nevertheless
it
would
seem
as
if
must
have
been
a
place
more
remote
from
cuzco
and
better
defended
by
nature
from
any
attacks
on
that
side
how
else
would
it
have
been
possible
for
the
disorganized
remnant
of
pachacuti
vi
army
to
have
taken
refuge
there
and
set
up
an
independent
kingdom
in
the
face
of
the
warlike
invaders
from
the
south
a
few
men
might
have
hid
in
the
caves
of
puma
urco
but
paccaritampu
is
not
a
natural
citadel
the
surrounding
region
is
not
difficult
of
access
there
are
no
precipices
between
here
and
the
cuzco
basin
there
are
no
natural
defenses
against
such
an
invading
force
as
captured
the
capital
of
the
amautas
furthermore
tampu
means
a
place
of
temporary
abode
or
a
tavern
or
an
improved
piece
of
ground
or
farm
far
from
a
town
tocco
means
window
there
is
an
old
tavern
at
maucallacta
near
paccaritampu
but
there
are
no
windows
in
the

justify
the
name
of

tavern

at

the
word
does
not
occur

able
to
consult
nor
is
it
in
the
exhaustive

of
peru
compiled
by

chapter
xvii
machu
picchu
it
was
in
july
that
we
first
entered
that
marvelous
canyon
of
the
urubamba
where
the
river
escapes
from
the
cold
regions
near
cuzco
by
tearing
its
way
through
gigantic
mountains
of
granite
from
torontoy
to
colpani
the
road
runs
through
a
land
of
matchless
charm
it
has
the
majestic
grandeur
of
the
canadian
rockies
as
well
as
the
startling
beauty
of
the
nuuanu
pali
near
honolulu
and
the
enchanting
vistas
of
the
koolau
ditch
trail
on
maul
in
the
variety
of
its
charms
and
the
power
of
its
spell
i
know
of
no
place
in
the
world
which
can
compare
with
it
not
only
has
it
great
snow
peaks
looming
above
the
clouds
more
than
two
miles
overhead
gigantic
precipices
of
granite
rising
sheer
for
thousands
of
feet
above
the
foaming
glistening
roaring
rapids
it
has
also
in
striking
contrast
orchids
and
tree
ferns
the
delectable
beauty
of
luxurious
vegetation
and
the
mysterious
witchery
of
the
jungle
one
is
drawn
irresistibly
onward
by
surprises
through
a
deep
winding
gorge
turning
and
twisting
past
overhanging
cliffs
of
incredible
height
above
all
there
is
the
fascination
of
finding
here
and
there
under
the
swaying
vines
or
perched
on
top
of
a
beetling
crag
the
rugged
masonry
of
a
bygone
race
and
of
trying
to
understand
the
bewildering
romance
of
the
ancient
builders
who
ages
ago
sought
refuge
in
a
region
which
appears
to
have
been
expressly
designed
by
nature
as
a
sanctuary
for
the
oppressed
a
place
where
they
might
fearlessly
and
patiently
give
expression
to
their
passion
for
walls
of
enduring
beauty
space
forbids
any
attempt
to
describe
in
detail
the
constantly
changing
panorama
the
rank
tropical
foliage
the
countless
terraces
the
towering
cliffs
the
glaciers
peeping
out
between
the
clouds
we
had
camped
at
a
place
near
the
river
called
mandor
pampa
melchor
arteaga
proprietor
of
the
neighboring
farm
had
told
us
of
ruins
at
machu
picchu
as
was
related
in
chapter
x
the
morning
of
july
dawned
in
a
cold
drizzle
arteaga
shivered
and
seemed
inclined
to
stay
in
his
hut
i
offered
to
pay
him
well
if
he
would
show
me
the
ruins
he
demurred
and
said
it
was
too
hard
a
climb
for
such
a
wet
day
when
he
found
that
we
were
willing
to
pay
him
a
sol
three
or
four
times
the
ordinary
daily
wage
in
this
vicinity
he
finally
agreed
to
guide
us
to
the
ruins
no
one
supposed
that
they
would
be
particularly
interesting
accompanied
by
sergeant
carrasco
i
left
camp
at
ten
and
went
some
distance
upstream
on
the
road
we
passed
a
venomous
snake
which
recently
had
been
killed
this
region
has
an
unpleasant
notoriety
for
being
the
favorite
haunt
of
vipers
the
or
yellow
viper
commonly
known
as
the
a
very
venomous
serpent
capable
of
making
considerable
springs
when
in
pursuit
of
its
prey
is
common
hereabouts
later
two
of
our
mules
died
from
after
a
walk
of
three
quarters
of
an
hour
the
guide
left
the
main
road
and
plunged
down
through
the
jungle
to
the
bank
of
the
river
here
there
was
a
primitive
bridge
which
crossed
the
roaring
rapids
at
its
narrowest
part
where
the
stream
was
forced
to
flow
between
two
great
boulders
the
bridge
was
made
of
half
a
dozen
very
slender
logs
some
of
which
were
not
long
enough
to
span
the
distance
between
the
boulders
they
had
been
spliced
and
lashed
together
with
vines
arteaga
and
carrasco
took
off
their
shoes
and
crept
gingerly
across
using
their
somewhat
prehensile
toes
to
keep
from
slipping
it
was
obvious
that
no
one
could
have
lived
for
an
instant
in
the
rapids
but
would
immediately
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
against
granite
boulders
i
am
frank
to
confess
that
i
got
down
on
hands
and
knees
and
crawled
across
six
inches
at
a
time
even
after
we
reached
the
other
side
i
could
not
help
wondering
what
would
happen
to
the
bridge
if
a
particularly
heavy
shower
should
fall
in
the
valley
above
a
light
rain
had
fallen
during
the
night
the
river
had
risen
so
that
the
bridge
was
already
threatened
by
the
foaming
rapids
it
would
not
take
much
more
rain
to
wash
away
the
bridge
entirely
if
this
should
happen
during
the
day
it
might
be
very
awkward
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
did
happen
a
few
days
later
and
the
next
explorers
to
attempt
to
cross
the
river
at
this
point
found
only
one
slender
log
remaining
leaving
the
stream
we
struggled
up
the
bank
through
a
dense
jungle
and
in
a
few
minutes
reached
the
bottom
of
a
precipitous
slope
for
an
hour
and
twenty
minutes
we
had
a
hard
climb
a
good
part
of
the
distance
we
went
on
all
fours
sometimes
hanging
on
by
the
tips
of
our
fingers
here
and
there
a
primitive
ladder
made
from
the
roughly
hewn
trunk
of
a
small
tree
was
placed
in
such
a
way
as
to
help
one
over
what
might
otherwise
have
proved
to
be
an
impassable
cliff
in
another
place
the
slope
was
covered
with
slippery
grass
where
it
was
hard
to
find
either
handholds
or
footholds
the
guide
said
that
there
were
lots
of
snakes
here
the
humidity
was
great
the
heat
was
excessive
and
we
were
not
in
training
shortly
after
noon
we
reached
a
little
hut
where
several
indians
pleasantly
surprised
at
our
unexpected
arrival
welcomed
us
with
dripping
gourds
full
of
cool
delicious
water
then
they
set
before
us
a
few
cooked
sweet
potatoes
called
here
cumara
a
quichua
word
identical
with
the
polynesian
kumala
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
cook
apart
from
the
wonderful
view
of
the
canyon
all
we
could
see
from
our
cool
shelter
was
a
couple
of
small
grass
huts
and
a
few
ancient
terraces
two
pleasant
indian
farmers
richarte
and
alvarez
had
chosen
this
eagle
nest
for
their
home
they
said
they
had
found
plenty
of
terraces
here
on
which
to
grow
their
crops
and
they
were
usually
free
from
undesirable
visitors
they
did
not
speak
spanish
but
through
sergeant
carrasco
i
learned
that
there
were
more
ruins
a
little
farther
along
in
this
country
one
never
can
tell
whether
such
a
report
is
worthy
of
credence
he
may
have
been
lying
is
a
good
footnote
to
affix
to
all
hearsay
evidence
accordingly
i
was
not
unduly
excited
nor
in
a
great
hurry
to
move
the
heat
was
still
great
the
water
from
the
indian
spring
was
cool
and
delicious
and
the
rustic
wooden
bench
hospitably
covered
immediately
after
my
arrival
with
a
soft
woolen
poncho
seemed
most
comfortable
furthermore
the
view
was
simply
enchanting
tremendous
green
precipices
fell
away
to
the
white
rapids
of
the
urubamba
below
immediately
in
front
on
the
north
side
of
the
valley
was
a
great
granite
cliff
rising
feet
sheer
to
the
left
was
the
solitary
peak
of
huayna
picchu
surrounded
by
seemingly
inaccessible
precipices
on
all
sides
were
rocky
cliffs
beyond
them
mountains
rose
thousands
of
feet
above
us
the
indians
said
there
were
two
paths
to
the
outside
world
of
one
we
had
already
had
a
taste
the
other
they
said
was
more
difficult
a
perilous
path
down
the
face
of
a
rocky
precipice
on
the
other
side
of
the
ridge
it
was
their
only
means
of
egress
in
the
wet
season
when
the
bridge
over
which
we
had
come
could
not
be
maintained
i
was
not
surprised
to
learn
that
they
went
away
from
home
only
about
once
a
month
richarte
told
us
that
they
had
been
living
here
four
years
it
seems
probable
that
owing
to
its
inaccessibility
the
canyon
had
been
unoccupied
for
several
centuries
but
with
the
completion
of
the
new
government
road
settlers
began
once
more
to
occupy
this
region
in
time
somebody
clambered
up
the
precipices
and
found
on
the
slopes
of
machu
picchu
at
an
elevation
of
feet
above
the
sea
an
abundance
of
rich
soil
conveniently
situated
on
artificial
terraces
in
a
fine
climate
here
the
indians
had
finally
cleared
off
some
ruins
burned
over
a
few
terraces
and
planted
crops
of
maize
sweet
and
white
potatoes
sugar
cane
beans
peppers
tree
tomatoes
and
gooseberries
at
first
they
appropriated
some
of
the
ancient
houses
and
replaced
the
roofs
of
wood
and
thatch
they
found
however
that
there
were
neither
springs
nor
wells
near
the
ancient
buildings
an
ancient
aqueduct
which
had
once
brought
a
tiny
stream
to
the
citadel
had
long
since
disappeared
beneath
the
forest
filled
with
earth
washed
from
the
upper
terraces
so
abandoning
the
shelter
of
the
ruins
the
indians
were
now
enjoying
the
convenience
of
living
near
some
springs
in
roughly
built
thatched
huts
of
their
own
design
without
the
slightest
expectation
of
finding
anything
more
interesting
than
the
terraces
of
which
i
already
had
a
glimpse
and
the
ruins
of
two
or
three
stone
houses
such
as
we
had
encountered
at
various
places
on
the
road
between
ollantaytambo
and
torontoy
i
finally
left
the
cool
shade
of
the
pleasant
little
hut
and
climbed
farther
up
the
ridge
and
around
a
slight
promontory
arteaga
had
been
here
once
before
and
decided
to
rest
and
gossip
with
richarte
and
alvarez
in
the
hut
they
sent
a
small
boy
with
me
as
a
guide
hardly
had
we
rounded
the
promontory
when
the
character
of
the
stonework
began
to
improve
a
flight
of
beautifully
constructed
terraces
each
two
hundred
yards
long
and
ten
feet
high
had
then
recently
rescued
from
the
jungle
by
the
indians
a
forest
of
large
trees
had
been
chopped
down
and
burned
over
to
make
a
clearing
for
agricultural
purposes
crossing
these
terraces
i
entered
the
untouched
forest
beyond
and
suddenly
found
myself
in
a
maze
of
beautiful
granite
houses
they
were
covered
with
trees
and
moss
and
the
growth
of
centuries
but
in
the
dense
shadow
hiding
in
bamboo
thickets
and
tangled
vines
could
be
seen
here
and
there
walls
of
white
granite
ashlars
most
carefully
cut
and
exquisitely
fitted
together
buildings
with
windows
were
frequent
here
at
least
was
a
place
far
from
town
and
conspicuous
for
its
windows
figure
flashlight
view
of
interior
of
cave
machu
picchu
figure
temple
over
cave
at
machu
picchu
suggested
by
the
author
as
the
probable
site
of
under
a
carved
rock
the
little
boy
showed
me
a
cave
beautifully
lined
with
the
finest
cut
stone
it
was
evidently
intended
to
be
a
royal
mausoleum
on
top
of
this
particular
boulder
a
semicircular
building
had
been
constructed
the
wall
followed
the
natural
curvature
of
the
rock
and
was
keyed
to
it
by
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
masonry
i
have
ever
seen
this
beautiful
wall
made
of
carefully
matched
ashlars
of
pure
white
granite
especially
selected
for
its
fine
grain
was
the
work
of
a
master
artist
the
interior
surface
of
the
wall
was
broken
by
niches
and
square
the
exterior
surface
was
perfectly
simple
and
unadorned
the
lower
courses
of
particularly
large
ashlars
gave
it
a
look
of
solidity
the
upper
courses
diminishing
in
size
toward
the
top
lent
grace
and
delicacy
to
the
structure
the
flowing
lines
the
symmetrical
arrangement
of
the
ashlars
and
the
gradual
gradation
of
the
courses
combined
to
produce
a
wonderful
effect
softer
and
more
pleasing
than
that
of
the
marble
temples
of
the
old
world
owing
to
the
absence
of
mortar
there
are
no
ugly
spaces
between
the
rocks
they
might
have
grown
together
the
elusive
beauty
of
this
chaste
undecorated
surface
seems
to
me
to
be
due
to
the
fact
that
the
wall
was
built
under
the
eye
of
a
master
mason
who
knew
not
the
straight
edge
the
plumb
rule
or
the
square
he
had
no
instruments
of
precision
so
he
had
to
depend
on
his
eye
he
had
a
good
eye
an
artistic
eye
an
eye
for
symmetry
and
beauty
of
form
his
product
received
none
of
the
harshness
of
mechanical
and
mathematical
accuracy
the
apparently
rectangular
blocks
are
not
really
rectangular
the
apparently
straight
lines
of
the
courses
are
not
actually
straight
in
the
exact
sense
of
that
term
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
that
this
wall
and
its
adjoining
semicircular
temple
over
the
cave
were
as
fine
as
the
finest
stonework
in
the
temple
of
the
sun
in
cuzco
surprise
followed
surprise
in
bewildering
succession
i
climbed
a
marvelous
great
stairway
of
large
granite
blocks
walked
along
a
pampa
where
the
indians
had
a
small
vegetable
garden
and
came
into
a
little
clearing
here
were
the
ruins
of
two
of
the
finest
structures
i
have
ever
seen
in
peru
not
only
were
they
made
of
selected
blocks
of
beautifully
grained
white
granite
their
walls
contained
ashlars
of
cyclopean
size
ten
feet
in
length
and
higher
than
a
man
the
sight
held
me
spellbound
each
building
had
only
three
walls
and
was
entirely
open
on
the
side
toward
the
clearing
the
principal
temple
was
lined
with
exquisitely
made
niches
five
high
up
at
each
end
and
seven
on
the
back
wall
there
were
seven
courses
of
ashlars
in
the
end
walls
under
the
seven
rear
niches
was
a
rectangular
block
fourteen
feet
long
probably
a
sacrificial
altar
the
building
did
not
look
as
though
it
had
ever
had
a
roof
the
top
course
of
beautifully
smooth
ashlars
was
not
intended
to
be
covered
the
other
temple
is
on
the
east
side
of
the
pampa
i
called
it
the
temple
of
the
three
windows
like
its
neighbor
it
is
unique
among
inca
ruins
its
eastern
wall
overlooking
the
citadel
is
a
massive
stone
framework
for
three
conspicuously
large
windows
obviously
too
large
to
serve
any
useful
purpose
yet
most
beautifully
made
with
the
greatest
care
and
solidity
this
was
clearly
a
ceremonial
edifice
of
peculiar
significance
nowhere
else
in
peru
so
far
as
i
know
is
there
a
similar
structure
conspicuous
as
a
masonry
wall
with
three
windows
these
ruins
have
no
other
name
than
that
of
the
mountain
on
the
slopes
of
which
they
are
located
had
this
place
been
occupied
uninterruptedly
like
cuzco
and
ollantaytambo
machu
picchu
would
have
retained
its
ancient
name
but
during
the
centuries
when
it
was
abandoned
its
name
was
lost
examination
showed
that
it
was
essentially
a
fortified
place
a
remote
fastness
protected
by
natural
bulwarks
of
which
man
took
advantage
to
create
the
most
impregnable
stronghold
in
the
andes
our
subsequent
excavations
and
the
clearing
made
in
to
be
described
in
a
subsequent
volume
has
shown
that
this
was
the
chief
place
in
uilcapampa
it
did
not
take
an
expert
to
realize
from
the
glimpse
of
machu
picchu
on
that
rainy
day
in
july
when
sergeant
carrasco
and
i
first
saw
it
that
here
were
most
extraordinary
and
interesting
ruins
although
the
ridge
had
been
partly
cleared
by
the
indians
for
their
fields
of
maize
so
much
of
it
was
still
underneath
a
thick
jungle
growth
some
walls
were
actually
supporting
trees
ten
and
twelve
inches
in
diameter
that
it
was
impossible
to
determine
just
what
would
be
found
here
as
soon
as
i
could
get
hold
of
tucker
who
was
assisting
hendriksen
and
lanius
who
had
gone
down
the
urubamba
with
dr
bowman
i
asked
them
to
make
a
map
of
the
ruins
i
knew
it
would
be
a
difficult
undertaking
and
that
it
was
essential
for
tucker
to
join
me
in
arequipa
not
later
than
the
first
of
october
for
the
ascent
of
coropuna
with
the
hearty
aid
of
richarte
and
alvarez
the
surveyors
did
better
than
i
expected
in
the
ten
days
while
they
were
at
the
ruins
they
were
able
to
secure
data
from
which
tucker
afterwards
prepared
a
map
which
told
better
than
could
any
words
of
mine
the
importance
of
this
site
and
the
necessity
for
further
investigation
with
the
possible
exception
of
one
mining
prospector
no
one
in
cuzco
had
seen
the
ruins
of
machu
picchu
or
appreciated
their
importance
no
one
had
any
realization
of
what
an
extraordinary
place
lay
on
top
of
the
ridge
it
had
never
been
visited
by
any
of
the
planters
of
the
lower
urubamba
valley
who
annually
passed
over
the
road
which
winds
through
the
canyon
two
thousand
feet
below
it
seems
incredible
that
this
citadel
less
than
three
days
journey
from
cuzco
should
have
remained
so
long
undescribed
by
travelers
and
comparatively
unknown
even
to
the
peruvians
themselves
if
the
conquistadores
ever
saw
this
wonderful
place
some
reference
to
it
surely
would
have
been
made
yet
nothing
can
be
found
which
clearly
refers
to
the
ruins
of
machu
picchu
just
when
it
was
first
seen
by
a
person
is
uncertain
when
the
count
de
sartiges
was
at
huadquiña
in
he
was
looking
for
ruins
yet
although
so
near
he
heard
of
none
here
from
a
crude
scrawl
on
the
walls
of
one
of
the
finest
buildings
we
learned
that
the
ruins
were
visited
in
by
lizarraga
lessee
of
the
lands
immediately
below
the
bridge
of
san
miguel
this
is
the
earliest
local
record
yet
some
one
must
have
visited
machu
picchu
long
before
that
because
in
as
has
been
said
the
french
explorer
charles
wiener
heard
in
ollantaytambo
of
there
being
ruins
at
or
he
tried
to
find
them
that
he
failed
was
due
to
there
being
no
road
through
the
canyon
of
torontoy
and
the
necessity
of
making
a
wide
detour
through
the
pass
of
panticalla
and
the
lucumayo
valley
a
route
which
brought
him
to
the
urubamba
river
at
the
bridge
of
chuquichaca
miles
below

figure

of

machu

of

it
was
not
until
that
the
peruvian
government
recognizing
the
needs
of
the
enterprising
planters
who
were
opening
up
the
lower
valley
of
the
urubamba
decided
to
construct
a
mule
trail
along
the
banks
of
the
river
through
the
grand
canyon
to
enable
the
coca
and
aguardiente
to
be
shipped
from
huadquiña
maranura
and
santa
ann
to
cuzco
more
quickly
and
cheaply
than
formerly
this
road
avoids
the
necessity
of
carrying
the
precious
cargoes
over
the
dangerous
snowy
passes
of
mt
veronica
and
mt
salcantay
so
vividly
described
by
raimondi
de
sartiges
and
others
the
road
however
was
very
expensive
took
years
to
build
and
still
requires
frequent
repair
in
fact
even
travel
over
it
is
often
suspended
for
several
days
or
weeks
at
a
time
following
some
tremendous
avalanche
yet
it
was
this
new
road
which
had
led
melchor
arteaga
to
build
his
hut
near
the
arable
land
at
mandor
pampa
where
he
could
raise
food
for
his
family
and
offer
rough
shelter
to
passing
travelers
it
was
this
new
road
which
brought
richarte
alvarez
and
their
enterprising
friends
into
this
region
gave
them
the
opportunity
of
occupying
the
ancient
terraces
of
machu
picchu
which
had
lain
fallow
for
centuries
encouraged
them
to
keep
open
a
passable
trail
over
the
precipices
and
made
it
feasible
for
us
to
reach
the
ruins
it
was
this
new
road
which
offered
us
in
a
virgin
field
between
ollantaytambo
and
huadquiña
and
enabled
us
to
learn
that
the
incas
or
their
predecessors
had
once
lived
here
in
the
remote
fastnesses
of
the
andes
and
had
left
stone
witnesses
of
the
magnificence
and
beauty
of
their
ancient
civilization
more
interesting
and
extensive
than
any
which
have
been
found
since
the
days
of
the
spanish
conquest
of
peru
chapter
xviii
the
origin
of
machu
picchu
some
other
day
i
hope
to
tell
of
the
work
of
clearing
and
excavating
machu
picchu
of
the
life
lived
by
its
citizens
and
of
the
ancient
towns
of
which
it
was
the
most
important
at
present
i
must
rest
content
with
a
discussion
of
its
probable
identity
here
was
a
powerful
citadel
tenable
against
all
odds
a
stronghold
where
a
mere
handful
of
defenders
could
prevent
a
great
army
from
taking
the
place
by
assault
why
should
any
one
have
desired
to
be
so
secure
from
capture
as
to
have
built
a
fortress
in
such
an
inaccessible
place
the
builders
were
not
in
search
of
fields
there
is
so
little
arable
land
here
that
every
square
yard
of
earth
had
to
be
terraced
in
order
to
provide
food
for
the
inhabitants
they
were
not
looking
for
comfort
or
convenience
safety
was
their
primary
consideration
they
were
sufficiently
civilized
to
practice
intensive
agriculture
sufficiently
skillful
to
equal
the
best
masonry
the
world
has
ever
seen
sufficiently
ingenious
to
make
delicate
bronzes
and
sufficiently
advanced
in
art
to
realize
the
beauty
of
simplicity
what
could
have
induced
such
a
people
to
select
this
remote
fastness
of
the
andes
with
all
its
disadvantages
as
the
site
for
their
capital
unless
they
were
fleeing
from
powerful
enemies
the
thought
will
already
have
occurred
to
the
reader
that
the
temple
of
the
three
windows
at
machu
picchu
fits
the
words
of
that
native
writer
who
had
heard
from
a
child
the
most
ancient
traditions
and
histories
including
the
story
already
quoted
from
sir
clements
markham
translation
that
manco
ccapac
the
first
inca
ordered
works
to
be
executed
at
the
place
of
his
birth
consisting
of
a
masonry
wall
with
three
windows
which
were
emblems
of
the
house
of
his
fathers
whence
he
descended
the
first
window
was
called
although
none
of
the
other
chroniclers
gives
the
story
of
the
first
inca
ordering
a
memorial
wall
to
be
built
at
the
place
of
his
birth
they
nearly
all
tell
of
his
having
come
from
a
place
called
an
inn
or
country
place
remarkable
for
its
windows
sir
clements
markham
in
his
incas
of
peru
refers
to
as
the
hill
with
the
three
openings
or
windows
the
place
assigned
by
all
the
chroniclers
as
the
location
of
the
traditional
as
has
been
said
is
paccaritampu
about
nine
miles
southwest
of
cuzco
paccaritampu
has
some
interesting
ruins
and
caves
but
careful
examination
shows
that
while
there
are
more
than
three
openings
to
its
caves
there
are
no
windows
in
its
buildings
the
buildings
of
machu
picchu
on
the
other
hand
have
far
more
windows
than
any
other
important
ruin
in
peru
the
climate
of
paccaritampu
like
that
of
most
places
in
the
highlands
is
too
severe
to
invite
or
encourage
the
use
of
windows
the
climate
of
machu
picchu
is
mild
consequently
the
use
of
windows
was
natural
and
agreeable
so
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
place
in
peru
where
the
ruins
consist
of
anything
like
a
masonry
wall
with
three
windows
of
such
a
ceremonial
character
as
is
here
referred
to
except
at
machu
picchu
it
would
certainly
seem
as
though
the
temple
of
the
three
windows
the
most
significant
structure
within
the
citadel
is
the
building
referred
to
by
pachacuti
yamqui
saleamayhua
figure
the
masonry
wall
with
three
windows
machu
picchu
the
principal
difficulty
with
this
theory
is
that
while
the
first
meaning
of
tocco
in
holguin
standard
quichua
dictionary
is
ventana
or
window
and
while
window
is
the
only
meaning
given
this
important
word
in
markham
revised
quichua
dictionary
a
dictionary
compiled
from
many
sources
the
second
meaning
of
tocco
given
by
holguin
is
alacena
a
cupboard
set
in
a
wall
undoubtedly
this
means
what
we
call
in
the
ruins
of
the
houses
of
the
incas
a
niche
now
the
drawings
crude
as
they
are
in
sir
clements
translation
of
the
salcamayhua
manuscript
do
give
the
impression
of
niches
rather
than
of
windows
does
mean
a
tampu
remarkable
for
its
niches
at
paccaritampu
there
do
not
appear
to
be
any
particularly
fine
niches
while
at
machu
picchu
on
the
other
hand
there
are
many
very
beautiful
niches
especially
in
the
cave
which
has
been
referred
to
as
a
royal
mausoleum
as
a
matter
of
fact
nearly
all
the
finest
ruins
of
the
incas
have
excellent
niches
since
niches
were
so
common
a
feature
of
inca
architecture
the
chances
are
that
sir
clements
is
right
in
translating
salcamayhua
as
he
did
and
in
calling
the
hill
with
the
three
openings
or
windows
in
any
case
machu
picchu
fits
the
story
far
better
than
does
paccaritampu
however
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
early
writers
all
repeat
the
story
that
was
at
paccaritampu
it
would
be
absurd
to
say
that
they
did
not
know
what
they
were
talking
about
even
though
the
actual
remains
at
or
near
paccaritampu
do
not
fit
the
requirements
it
would
be
easier
to
adopt
paccaritampu
as
the
site
of
were
it
not
for
the
legal
records
of
an
inquiry
made
by
toledo
at
the
time
when
he
put
the
last
inca
to
death
fifteen
indians
descended
from
those
who
used
to
live
near
las
salinas
the
important
salt
works
near
cuzco
on
being
questioned
agreed
that
they
had
heard
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
repeat
the
tradition
that
when
the
first
inca
manco
ccapac
captured
their
lands
he
came
from
they
did
not
say
that
the
first
inca
came
from
paccaritampu
which
it
seems
to
me
would
have
been
a
most
natural
thing
for
them
to
have
said
if
this
were
the
general
belief
of
the
natives
in
addition
there
is
the
still
older
testimony
of
some
indians
born
before
the
arrival
of
the
first
spaniards
who
were
examined
at
a
legal
investigation
in
a
chief
aged
testified
that
manco
ccapac
came
out
of
a
cave
called
tocco
and
that
he
was
lord
of
the
town
near
that
cave
not
one
of
the
witnesses
stated
that
manco
ccapac
came
from
paccaritampu
although
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
why
they
should
not
have
done
so
if
as
the
contemporary
historians
believed
this
was
really
the
original
the
chroniclers
were
willing
enough
to
accept
the
interesting
cave
near
paccaritampu
as
the
place
where
manco
ccapac
was
born
and
from
which
he
came
to
conquer
cuzco
why
were
the
sworn
witnesses
so
reticent
it
seems
hardly
possible
that
they
should
have
forgotten
where
was
supposed
to
have
been
was
their
reticence
due
to
the
fact
that
its
actual
whereabouts
had
been
successfully
kept
secret
manco
ccapac
home
was
that
to
which
the
followers
of
pachacuti
vi
fled
with
his
body
after
the
overthrow
of
the
old
régime
a
very
secluded
and
holy
place
did
they
know
it
was
in
the
same
fastnesses
of
the
andes
to
which
in
the
days
of
pizarro
the
young
inca
manco
had
fled
from
cuzco
was
this
the
cause
of
their
reticence
certainly
the
requirements
of
are
met
at
machu
picchu
the
splendid
natural
defenses
of
the
grand
canyon
of
the
urubamba
made
it
an
ideal
refuge
for
the
descendants
of
the
amautas
during
the
centuries
of
lawlessness
and
confusion
which
succeeded
the
barbarian
invasions
from
the
plains
to
the
east
and
south
the
scarcity
of
violent
earthquakes
and
also
its
healthfulness
both
marked
characteristics
of
are
met
at
machu
picchu
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
existence
of
machu
picchu
might
easily
have
been
concealed
from
the
common
people
at
the
time
of
the
spanish
conquest
its
location
might
have
been
known
only
to
the
inca
and
his
priests
so
notwithstanding
the
belief
of
the
historians
i
feel
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
first
name
of
the
ruins
at
machu
picchu
was
here
pachacuti
vi
was
buried
here
was
the
capital
of
the
little
kingdom
where
during
the
centuries
between
the
amautas
and
the
incas
there
was
kept
alive
the
wisdom
skill
and
best
traditions
of
the
ancient
folk
who
had
developed
the
civilization
of
peru
it
is
well
to
remember
that
the
defenses
of
cuzco
were
of
little
avail
before
the
onslaught
of
the
warlike
invaders
the
great
organization
of
farmers
and
masons
so
successful
in
its
ability
to
perform
mighty
feats
of
engineering
with
primitive
tools
of
wood
stone
and
bronze
had
crumbled
away
before
the
attacks
of
savage
hordes
who
knew
little
of
the
arts
of
peace
the
defeated
leaders
had
to
choose
a
region
where
they
might
live
in
safety
from
their
fierce
enemies
furthermore
in
the
environs
of
machu
picchu
they
found
every
variety
of
climate
valleys
so
low
as
to
produce
the
precious
coca
yucca
and
plantain
the
fruits
and
vegetables
of
the
tropics
slopes
high
enough
to
be
suitable
for
many
varieties
of
maize
quinoa
and
other
cereals
as
well
as
their
favorite
root
crops
including
both
sweet
and
white
potatoes
oca
añu
and
ullucu
here
within
a
few
hours
journey
they
could
find
days
warm
enough
to
dry
and
cure
the
coca
leaves
nights
cold
enough
to
freeze
potatoes
in
the
approved
aboriginal
fashion
although
the
amount
of
arable
land
which
could
be
made
available
with
the
most
careful
terracing
was
not
large
enough
to
support
a
very
great
population
machu
picchu
offered
an
impregnable
citadel
to
the
chiefs
and
priests
and
their
handful
of
followers
who
were
obliged
to
flee
from
the
rich
plains
near
cuzco
and
the
broad
pleasant
valley
of
yucay
only
dire
necessity
and
terror
could
have
forced
a
people
which
had
reached
such
a
stage
in
engineering
architecture
and
agriculture
to
leave
hospitable
valleys
and
tablelands
for
rugged
canyons
certainly
there
is
no
part
of
the
andes
less
fitted
by
nature
to
meet
the
requirements
of
an
agricultural
folk
unless
their
chief
need
was
a
safe
refuge
and
retreat
here
the
wise
remnant
of
the
amautas
ultimately
developed
great
ability
in
the
face
of
tremendous
natural
obstacles
they
utilized
their
ancient
craft
to
wrest
a
living
from
the
soil
hemmed
in
between
the
savages
of
the
amazon
jungles
below
and
their
enemies
on
the
plateau
above
they
must
have
carried
on
border
warfare
for
generations
aided
by
the
temperate
climate
in
which
they
lived
and
the
ability
to
secure
a
wide
variety
of
food
within
a
few
climb
up
or
down
from
their
towns
and
cities
they
became
a
hardy
vigorous
tribe
which
in
the
course
of
time
burst
its
boundaries
fought
its
way
back
to
the
rich
cuzco
valley
overthrew
the
descendants
of
the
ancient
invaders
and
established
with
cuzco
as
a
capital
the
empire
of
the
incas
after
the
first
inca
manco
ccapac
had
established
himself
in
cuzco
what
more
natural
than
that
he
should
have
built
a
fine
temple
in
honor
of
his
ancestors
ancestor
worship
was
common
to
the
incas
and
nothing
would
have
been
more
reasonable
than
the
construction
of
the
temple
of
the
three
windows
as
the
incas
grew
in
power
and
extended
their
rule
over
the
ancient
empire
of
the
cuzco
amautas
from
whom
they
traced
their
descent
superstitious
regard
would
have
led
them
to
establish
their
chief
temples
and
palaces
in
the
city
of
cuzco
itself
there
was
no
longer
any
necessity
to
maintain
the
citadel
of
it
was
probably
deserted
while
cuzco
grew
and
the
inca
empire
flourished
as
the
incas
increased
in
power
they
invented
various
myths
to
account
for
their
origin
one
of
these
traced
their
ancestry
to
the
islands
of
lake
titicaca
finally
the
very
location
of
manco
ccapac
birthplace
was
forgotten
by
the
common
people
although
undoubtedly
known
to
the
priests
and
those
who
preserved
the
most
sacred
secrets
of
the
incas
then
came
pizarro
and
the
bigoted
conquistadores
the
native
chiefs
faced
the
necessity
of
saving
whatever
was
possible
of
the
ancient
religion
the
spaniards
coveted
gold
and
silver
the
most
precious
possessions
of
the
incas
however
were
not
images
and
utensils
but
the
sacred
virgins
of
the
sun
who
like
the
vestal
virgins
of
rome
were
from
their
earliest
childhood
trained
to
the
service
of
the
great
sun
god
looked
at
from
the
standpoint
of
an
agricultural
people
who
needed
the
sun
to
bring
their
food
crops
to
fruition
and
keep
them
from
hunger
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
to
placate
him
with
sacrifices
and
secure
the
good
effects
of
his
smiling
face
if
he
delayed
his
coming
or
kept
himself
hidden
behind
the
clouds
the
maize
would
mildew
and
the
ears
would
not
properly
ripen
if
he
did
not
shine
with
his
accustomed
brightness
after
the
harvest
the
ears
of
corn
could
not
be
properly
dried
and
kept
over
to
the
next
year
in
short
any
unusual
behavior
on
the
part
of
the
sun
meant
hunger
and
famine
consequently
their
most
beautiful
daughters
were
consecrated
to
his
service
as
virgins
who
lived
in
the
temple
and
ministered
to
the
wants
of
priests
and
rulers
human
sacrifice
had
long
since
been
given
up
in
peru
and
its
place
taken
by
the
consecration
of
these
damsels
some
of
the
virgins
of
the
sun
in
cuzco
were
captured
others
escaped
and
accompanied
manco
into
the
inaccessible
canyons
of
uilcapampa
it
will
be
remembered
that
father
calancha
relates
the
trials
of
the
first
two
missionaries
in
this
region
who
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
urged
the
inca
to
let
them
visit
the
university
of
idolatry
at
vilcabamba
viejo
the
largest
city
in
the
province
machu
picchu
admirably
answers
its
requirements
here
it
would
have
been
very
easy
for
the
inca
titu
cusi
to
have
kept
the
monks
in
the
vicinity
of
the
sacred
city
for
three
weeks
without
their
catching
a
single
glimpse
of
its
unique
temples
and
remarkable
palaces
it
would
have
been
possible
for
titu
cusi
to
bring
friar
marcos
and
friar
diego
to
the
village
of
intihuatana
near
san
miguel
at
the
foot
of
the
machu
picchu
cliffs
the
sugar
planters
of
the
lower
urubamba
valley
crossed
the
bridge
of
san
miguel
annually
for
twenty
years
in
blissful
ignorance
of
what
lay
on
top
of
the
ridge
above
them
so
the
friars
might
easily
have
been
lodged
in
huts
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
without
their
being
aware
of
the
extent
and
importance
of
the
inca
university
apparently
they
returned
to
puquiura
with
so
little
knowledge
of
the
architectural
character
of
vilcabamba
viejo
that
no
description
of
it
could
be
given
their
friends
eventually
to
be
reported
by
calancha
furthermore
the
difficult
journey
across
country
from
puquiura
might
easily
have
taken
three
days
finally
it
appears
from
eaton
studies
that
the
last
residents
of
machu
picchu
itself
were
mostly
women
in
the
burial
caves
which
we
have
found
in
the
region
roundabout
machu
picchu
the
proportion
of
skulls
belonging
to
men
is
very
large
there
are
many
trepanned
skulls
some
of
them
seem
to
belong
to
soldiers
injured
in
war
by
having
their
skulls
crushed
in
either
with
clubs
or
the
favorite
of
the
incas
in
no
case
have
we
found
more
than
skulls
without
encountering
some
trepanned
specimens
among
them
in
striking
contrast
is
the
result
of
the
excavations
at
machu
picchu
where
one
hundred
skulls
were
found
in
the
burial
caves
yet
not
one
had
been
trepanned
of
the
one
hundred
skeletons
whose
sex
could
be
accurately
determined
by
eaton
one
hundred
nine
were
females
furthermore
it
was
in
the
graves
of
the
females
that
the
finest
artifacts
were
found
showing
that
they
were
persons
of
no
little
importance
not
a
single
representative
of
the
robust
male
of
the
warrior
type
was
found
in
the
burial
caves
of
machu
picchu
another
striking
fact
brought
out
by
eaton
is
that
some
of
the
female
skeletons
represent
individuals
from
the
seacoast
this
fits
in
with
calancha
statement
that
titu
cusi
tempted
the
monks
not
only
with
beautiful
women
of
the
highlands
but
also
with
those
who
came
from
the
tribes
of
the
yungas
or
warm
valleys
the
warm
valleys
may
be
those
of
the
rubber
country
but
sir
clements
markham
thought
the
oases
of
the
coast
were
meant
furthermore
as
safford
has
pointed
out
among
the
artifacts
discovered
at
machu
picchu
was
a
snuffing
tube
intended
for
use
with
the
narcotic
snuff
which
was
employed
by
the
priests
and
necromancers
to
induce
a
hypnotic
state
this
powder
was
made
from
the
seeds
of
the
tree
which
the
incas
called
huilca
or
uilca
which
as
has
been
pointed
out
in
chapter
xi
grows
near
these
ruins
this
seems
to
me
to
furnish
additional
evidence
of
the
identity
of
machu
picchu
with
calancha
vilcabamba
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
ruins
of
machu
picchu
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
largest
city
in
which
was
the
university
of
idolatry
until
some
one
can
find
the
ruins
of
another
important
place
within
three
days
journey
of
pucyura
which
was
an
important
religious
center
and
whose
skeletal
remains
are
chiefly
those
of
women
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
this
was
the
vilcabamba
viejo
of
calancha
just
as
espiritu
pampa
was
the
vilcabamba
viejo
of
ocampo
in
the
interesting
account
of
the
last
incas
purporting
to
be
by
titu
cusi
but
actually
written
in
excellent
spanish
by
friar
marcos
he
says
that
his
father
manco
fleeing
from
cuzco
went
first
to
vilcabamba
the
head
of
all
that
province
in
the
anales
del
peru
montesinos
says
that
francisco
pizarro
thinking
that
the
inca
manco
wished
to
make
peace
with
him
tried
to
please
the
inca
by
sending
him
a
present
of
a
very
fine
pony
and
a
mulatto
to
take
care
of
it
in
place
of
rewarding
the
messenger
the
inca
killed
both
man
and
beast
when
pizarro
was
informed
of
this
he
took
revenge
on
manco
by
cruelly
abusing
the
inca
favorite
wife
and
putting
her
to
death
she
begged
of
her
attendants
that
when
she
should
be
dead
they
would
put
her
remains
in
a
basket
and
let
it
float
down
the
yucay
or
urubamba
river
that
the
current
might
take
it
to
her
husband
the
inca
she
must
have
believed
that
at
that
time
manco
was
near
this
river
machu
picchu
is
on
its
banks
espiritu
pampa
is
not
we
have
already
seen
how
manco
finally
established
himself
at
uiticos
where
he
restored
in
some
degree
the
fortunes
of
his
house
surrounded
by
fertile
valleys
not
too
far
removed
from
the
great
highway
which
the
spaniards
were
obliged
to
use
in
passing
from
lima
to
cuzco
he
could
readily
attack
them
at
machu
picchu
he
would
not
have
been
so
conveniently
located
for
robbing
the
spanish
caravans
nor
for
supplying
his
followers
with
arable
lands
there
is
abundant
archeological
evidence
that
the
citadel
of
machu
picchu
was
at
one
time
occupied
by
the
incas
and
partly
built
by
them
on
the
ruins
of
a
far
older
city
much
of
the
pottery
is
unquestionably
of
the
cuzco
style
used
by
the
last
incas
the
more
recent
buildings
resemble
those
structures
on
the
island
of
titicaca
said
to
have
been
built
by
the
later
incas
they
also
resemble
the
fortress
of
uiticos
at
rosaspata
built
by
manco
about
furthermore
they
are
by
far
the
largest
and
finest
ruins
in
the
mountains
of
the
old
province
of
uilcapampa
and
represent
the
place
which
would
naturally
be
spoken
of
by
titu
cusi
as
the
head
of
the
province
espiritu
pampa
does
not
satisfy
the
demands
of
a
place
which
was
so
important
as
to
give
its
name
to
the
entire
province
to
be
referred
to
as
the
largest
city
it
seems
quite
possible
that
the
inaccessible
forgotten
citadel
of
machu
picchu
was
the
place
chosen
by
manco
as
the
safest
refuge
for
those
virgins
of
the
sun
who
had
successfully
escaped
from
cuzco
in
the
days
of
pizarro
for
them
and
their
attendants
manco
probably
built
many
of
the
newer
buildings
and
repaired
some
of
the
older
ones
here
they
lived
out
their
days
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
no
indians
would
ever
breathe
to
the
conquistadores
the
secret
of
their
sacred
refuge
figure
the
gorges
opening
wide
apart
reveal
uilcapampa
granite
citadel
the
crown
of
inca
land
machu
picchu
when
the
worship
of
the
sun
actually
ceased
on
the
heights
of
machu
picchu
no
one
can
tell
that
the
secret
of
its
existence
was
so
well
kept
is
one
of
the
marvels
of
andean
history
unless
one
accepts
the
theories
of
its
identity
with
and
vilcabamba
viejo
there
is
no
clear
reference
to
machu
picchu
until
when
charles
wiener
heard
about
it
some
day
we
may
be
able
to
find
a
reference
in
one
of
the
documents
of
the
sixteenth
or
seventeenth
centuries
which
will
indicate
that
the
energetic
viceroy
toledo
or
a
contemporary
of
his
knew
of
this
marvelous
citadel
and
visited
it
writers
like
cieza
de
leon
and
polo
de
ondegardo
who
were
assiduous
in
collecting
information
about
all
the
holy
places
of
the
incas
give
the
names
of
many
places
which
as
yet
we
have
not
been
able
to
identify
among
them
we
may
finally
recognize
the
temples
of
machu
picchu
on
the
other
hand
it
seems
likely
that
if
any
of
the
spanish
soldiers
priests
or
other
chroniclers
had
seen
this
citadel
they
would
have
described
its
chief
edifices
in
unmistakable
terms
until
further
light
can
be
thrown
on
this
fascinating
problem
it
seems
reasonable
to
conclude
that
at
machu
picchu
we
have
the
ruins
of
the
birthplace
of
the
first
inca
manco
ccapac
and
also
the
ruins
of
a
sacred
city
of
the
last
incas
surely
this
granite
citadel
which
has
made
such
a
strong
appeal
to
us
on
account
of
its
striking
beauty
and
the
indescribable
charm
of
its
surroundings
appears
to
have
had
a
most
interesting
history
selected
about
as
the
safest
place
of
refuge
for
the
last
remnants
of
the
old
régime
fleeing
from
southern
invaders
it
became
the
site
of
the
capital
of
a
new
kingdom
and
gave
birth
to
the
most
remarkable
family
which
south
america
has
ever
seen
abandoned
about
when
cuzco
once
more
flashed
into
glory
as
the
capital
of
the
peruvian
empire
it
seems
to
have
been
again
sought
out
in
time
of
trouble
when
in
another
foreign
invader
arrived
this
time
from
europe
with
a
burning
desire
to
extinguish
all
vestiges
of
the
ancient
religion
in
its
last
state
it
became
the
home
and
refuge
of
the
virgins
of
the
sun
priestesses
of
the
most
humane
cult
of
aboriginal
america
here
concealed
in
a
canyon
of
remarkable
grandeur
protected
by
art
and
nature
these
consecrated
women
gradually
passed
away
leaving
no
known
descendants
nor
any
records
other
than
the
masonry
walls
and
artifacts
to
be
described
in
another
volume
whoever
they
were
whatever
name
be
finally
assigned
to
this

by
future

of
this
i
feel
sure
that

notes
many
people
have
asked
me
how
to
pronounce
machu
picchu
quichua
words
should
always
be
pronounced
as
nearly
as
possible
as
they
are
written
they
represent
an
attempt
at
phonetic
spelling
if
the
attempt
is
made
by
a
spanish
writer
he
is
always
likely
to
put
a
silent
h
at
the
beginning
of
such
words
as
huilca
which
is
pronounced
in
the
middle
of
a
word
h
is
always
sounded
machu
picchu
is
pronounced
uiticos
is
pronounced
uilcapampa
is
pronounced
cuzco
is

usually
about

fernando
montesinos
an
ecclesiastical
lawyer
of
the
seventeenth
century
appears
to
have
gone
to
peru
in
as
the
follower
of
that
viceroy
the
count
of
chinchon
whose
wife
having
contracted
malaria
was
cured
by
the
use
of
peruvian
bark
or
quinine
and
was
instrumental
in
the
introduction
of
this
medicine
into
europe
a
fact
which
has
been
commemorated
in
the
botanical
name
of
the
genus
cinchona
montesinos
was
well
educated
and
appears
to
have
given
himself
over
entirely
to
historical
research
he
traveled
extensively
in
peru
and
wrote
several
books
his
history
of
the
incas
was
spoiled
by
the
introduction
in
which
as
might
have
been
expected
of
an
orthodox
lawyer
he
contended
that
peru
was
peopled
under
the
leadership
of
ophir
the
of
noah
nevertheless
one
finds
his
work
to
be
of
great
value
and
the
late
sir
clements
markham
foremost
of
english
students
of
peruvian
archeology
was
inclined
to
place
considerable
credence
in
his
statements
his
account
of
peru
has
recently
been
edited
for
the
hakluyt
society
by
philip
a
means
of
harvard
university
another
version
of
this
event
is
that
the
quarrel
was
over
a
game
of
chess
between
the
inca
and
diego
mendez
another
of
the
refugees
who
lost
his
temper
and
called
the
inca
a
dog
angered
at
the
tone
and
language
of
his
guest
the
inca
gave
him
a
blow
with
his
fist
diego
mendez
thereupon
drew
a
dagger
and
killed
him
a
totally
different
account
from
the
one
obtained
by
garcilasso
from
his
informants
is
that
in
a
volume
purporting
to
have
been
dictated
to
friar
marcos
by
manco
son
titu
cusi
twenty
years
after
the
event
i
quote
from
sir
clements
markham
translation
after
these
spaniards
had
been
with
my
father
for
several
years
in
the
said
town
of
viticos
they
were
one
day
with
much
good
fellowship
playing
at
quoits
with
him
only
them
my
father
and
me
who
was
then
a
boy
ten
years
old
without
having
any
suspicion
although
an
indian
woman
named
banba
had
said
that
the
spaniards
wanted
to
murder
the
inca
my
father
was
playing
with
them
as
usual
in
this
game
just
as
my
father
was
raising
the
quoit
to
throw
they
all
rushed
upon
him
with
knives
daggers
and
some
swords
my
father
feeling
himself
wounded
strove
to
make
some
defence
but
he
was
one
and
unarmed
and
they
were
seven
fully
armed
he
fell
to
the
ground
covered
with
wounds
and
they
left
him
for
dead
i
being
a
little
boy
and
seeing
my
father
treated
in
this
manner
wanted
to
go
where
he
was
to
help
him
but
they
turned
furiously
upon
me
and
hurled
a
lance
which
only
just
failed
to
kill
me
also
i
was
terrified
and
fled
amongst
some
bushes
they
looked
for
me
but
could
not
find
me
the
spaniards
seeing
that
my
father
had
ceased
to
breathe
went
out
of
the
gate
in
high
spirits
saying
that
we
have
killed
the
inca
we
have
nothing
to
fear
but
at
this
moment
the
captain
rimachi
yupanqui
arrived
with
some
antis
and
presently
chased
them
in
such
sort
that
before
they
could
get
very
far
along
a
difficult
road
they
were
caught
and
pulled
from
their
horses
they
all
had
to
suffer
very
cruel
deaths
and
some
were
burnt
notwithstanding
his
wounds
my
father
lived
for
three
days
another
version
is
given
by
montesinos
in
his
anales
it
is
more
like
titu
cusi
a
spanish
derivative
from
the
quichua
mucha
a
kiss
muchani
means
to
adore
to
reverence
to
kiss
the
hands
uiticos
is
probably
derived
from
uiticuni
meaning
to
withdraw
to
a
distance

in
across
south
america
on
the
expedition

identical

modern
vilcabamba
the
name
applied
to
this
river
and
the
old
spanish
town
at
its
source
i
shall
distinguish
between
the
two
by
using
the
correct
official
spelling
for
the
river
and
town
vilcabamba
and
the
phonetic
spelling
uilcapampa
for
the
place
referred
to
in
the
contemporary
histories
of
the
inca
manco
in
those
days
the
term
andes
appears
to
have
been
very
limited
in
scope
and
was
applied
only
to
the
high
range
north
of
cuzco
where
lived
the
tribe
called
antis
their
name
was
given
to
the
