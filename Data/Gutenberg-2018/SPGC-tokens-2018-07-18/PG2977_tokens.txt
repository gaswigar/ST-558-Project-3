i
make
a
mistake
and

becomes
my
mortal
foe

vengeance
i
leave

valentia

i
arrive
at
barcelona
if
these
memoirs
only
written
to
console
me
in
the
dreadful
weariness
which
is
slowly
killing
me
in
bohemia
and
which
perhaps
would
kill
me
anywhere
since
though
my
body
is
old
my
spirit
and
my
desires
are
as
young
as
ever
if
these
memoirs
are
ever
read
i
repeat
they
will
only
be
read
when
i
am
gone
and
all
censure
will
be
lost
on
me
nevertheless
seeing
that
men
are
divided
into
two
sections
the
one
and
by
far
the
greater
composed
of
the
ignorant
and
superficial
and
the
other
of
the
learned
and
reflective
i
beg
to
state
that
it
is
to
the
latter
i
would
appeal
their
judgment
i
believe
will
be
in
favour
of
my
veracity
and
indeed
why
should
i
not
be
veracious
a
man
can
have
no
object
in
deceiving
himself
and
it
is
for
myself
that
i
chiefly
write
hitherto
i
have
spoken
nothing
but
the
truth
without
considering
whether
the
truth
is
in
my
favour
or
no
my
book
is
not
a
work
of
dogmatic
theology
but
i
do
not
think
it
will
do
harm
to
anyone
while
i
fancy
that
those
who
know
how
to
imitate
the
bee
and
to
get
honey
from
every
flower
will
be
able
to
extract
some
good
from
the
catalogue
of
my
vices
and
virtues
after
this
digression
it
may
be
too
long
but
that
is
my
business
and
none
other
i
must
confess
that
never
have
i
had
so
unpleasant
a
truth
to
set
down
as
that
which
i
am
going
to
relate
i
committed
a
fatal
act
of
indiscretion
an
act
which
after
all
these
years
still
gives
my
heart
a
pang
as
i
think
of
it
the
day
after
my
conquest
i
dined
with
the
venetian
ambassador
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
that
all
the
ministers
and
grandees
with
whom
i
had
associated
had
the
highest
possible
opinion
of
me
in
three
or
four
days
the
king
the
royal
family
and
the
ministers
would
return
to
town
and
i
expected
to
have
daily
conferences
with
the
latter
respecting
the
colony
in
the
sierra
morena
where
i
should
most
probably
be
going
manucci
who
continued
to
treat
me
as
a
valued
friend
proposed
to
accompany
me
on
my
journey
and
would
bring
with
him
an
adventuress
who
called
herself
pretending
to
be
the
daughter
or
niece
of
the
late
cardinal
of
that
name
and
thus
obtained
a
good
deal
of
consideration
though
in
reality
she
was
only
the
mistress
of
the
french
consul
at
madrid
the
abbe
bigliardi
such
was
the
promising
state
of
my
prospects
when
my
evil
genius
brought
to
madrid
a
native
of
liege
baron
de
fraiture
chief
huntsman
of
the
principality
and
a
profligate
a
gamester
and
a
cheat
like
all
those
who
proclaim
their
belief
in
his
honesty
nowadays
i
had
unfortunately
met
him
at
spa
and
told
him
i
was
was
going
to
portugal
he
had
come
after
me
hoping
to
use
me
as
a
means
of
getting
into
good
society
and
of
filling
his
pocket
with
the
money
of
the
dupes
he
aspired
to
make
gamesters
have
never
had
any
proof
of
my
belonging
to
their
infernal
clique
but
they
have
always
persisted
in
believing
that
i
too
am
a
greek
as
soon
as
this
baron
heard
that
i
was
in
madrid
he
called
on
me
and
by
dint
of
politeness
obliged
me
to
receive
him
i
thought
any
small
civilities
i
might
shew
or
introductions
i
might
give
could
do
me
no
harm
he
had
a
travelling
companion
to
whom
he
introduced
me
he
was
a
fat
ignorant
fellow
but
a
frenchman
and
therefore
agreeable
a
frenchman
who
knows
how
to
present
himself
who
is
well
dressed
and
has
the
society
air
is
usually
accepted
without
demur
or
scrutiny
he
had
been
a
cavalry
captain
but
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
an
everlasting
furlough
four
or
five
days
after
his
appearance
the
baron
asked
me
quietly
enough
to
lend
him
a
score
of
louis
as
he
was
hard
up
i
replied
as
quietly
thanking
him
for
treating
me
as
a
friend
but
informing
him
that
i
really
could
not
lend
him
the
money
as
i
wanted
what
little
i
had
for
my
own
necessities
but
we
can
do
good
business
together
and
you
can
not
possibly
be
moneyless
i
do
not
know
anything
about
good
business
but
i
do
know
that
i
want
my
money
and
can
not
part
with
it
we
are
at
our
wits
end
to
quiet
our
landlord
come
and
speak
to
him
if
i
were
to
do
so
i
should
do
you
more
harm
than
good
he
would
ask
me
if
i
would
answer
for
you
and
i
should
reply
that
you
are
one
of
those
noblemen
who
stand
in
need
of
no
surety
all
the
same
the
landlord
would
think
that
if
i
did
not
stand
your
surety
it
must
be
from
my
entertaining
doubts
as
to
your
solvency
i
had
introduced
fraiture
to
count
manucci
on
the
pando
and
he
requested
me
to
take
him
to
see
the
count
to
which
request
i
was
foolish
enough
to
accede
a
few
days
later
the
baron
opened
his
soul
to
manucci
he
found
the
venetian
disposed
to
be
obliging
but
wary
he
refused
to
lend
money
himself
but
introduced
the
baron
to
someone
who
lent
him
money
on
pledges
without
interest
the
baron
and
his
friend
did
a
little
gaming
and
won
a
little
money
but
i
held
aloof
from
them
to
the
best
of
my
ability
i
had
my
colony
and
donna
ignazia
and
wanted
to
live
peacefully
and
if
i
had
spent
a
single
night
away
from
home
the
innocent
girl
would
have
been
filled
with
alarm
about
that
time
de
mocenigo
went
as
ambassador
to
france
and
was
replaced
by
querini
querini
was
a
man
of
letters
while
mocenigo
only
liked
music
and
his
own
peculiar
kind
of
love
the
new
ambassador
was
distinctly
favourable
to
me
and
in
a
few
days
i
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
would
do
more
for
me
than
ever
mocenigo
would
have
done
in
the
meanwhile
the
baron
and
his
friend
began
to
think
of
beating
a
retreat
to
france
there
was
no
gaming
at
the
ambassador
and
no
gaming
at
the
court
they
must
return
to
france
but
they
owed
money
to
their
landlord
and
they
wanted
money
for
the
journey
i
could
give
them
nothing
manucci
would
give
them
nothing
we
both
pitied
them
but
our
duty
to
ourselves
made
us
cruel
to
everyone
else
however
he
brought
trouble
on
us
one
morning
manucci
came
to
see
me
in
evident
perturbation
what
is
the
matter
said
i
i
do
not
know
exactly
for
the
last
week
i
have
refused
to
see
the
baron
fraiture
as
not
being
able
to
give
him
money
his
presence
only
wearied
me
he
has
written
me
a
letter
in
which
he
threatens
to
blow
out
his
brains
if
i
will
not
lend
him
a
hundred
pistoles
he
said
the
same
thing
to
me
three
days
ago
but
i
replied
that
i
would
bet
two
hundred
pistoles
that
he
would
do
nothing
of
the
kind
this
made
him
angry
and
he
proposed
to
fight
a
duel
with
me
but
i
declined
on
the
plea
that
as
he
was
a
desperate
man
either
he
would
have
an
advantage
over
me
or
i
over
him
give
him
the
same
answer
or
better
still
no
answer
at
all
i
can
not
follow
your
advice
here
are
the
hundred
pistoles
take
them
to
him
and
get
a
receipt
i
admired
his
generosity
and
agreed
to
carry
out
his
commission
i
called
on
the
baron
who
seemed
rather
uncomfortable
when
i
walked
in
but
considering
his
position
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
i
informed
him
that
i
was
the
bearer
of
a
thousand
francs
from
count
manucci
who
thereby
placed
him
in
a
position
to
arrange
his
affairs
and
to
leave
madrid
he
received
the
money
without
any
signs
of
pleasure
surprise
or
gratitude
and
wrote
out
the
receipt
he
assured
me
that
he
and
his
friend
would
start
for
barcelona
and
france
on
the
following
day
i
then
took
the
document
to
manucci
who
was
evidently
suffering
from
some
mental
trouble
and
i
remained
to
dinner
with
the
ambassador
it
was
for
the
last
time
three
days
after
i
went
to
dine
with
the
ambassadors
for
they
all
dined
together
but
to
my
astonishment
the
porter
told
me
that
he
had
received
orders
not
to
admit
me
the
effect
of
this
sentence
on
me
was
like
that
of
a
thunderbolt
i
returned
home
like
a
man
in
a
dream
i
immediately
sat
down
and
wrote
to
manucci
asking
him
why
i
had
been
subjected
to
such
an
insult
but
philippe
my
man
brought
me
back
the
letter
unopened
this
was
another
surprise
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
next
what
can
be
the
matter
i
said
to
myself
i
can
not
imagine
but
i
will
have
an
explanation
or
perish
i
dined
sadly
with
donna
ignazia
without
telling
her
the
cause
of
my
trouble
and
just
as
i
was
going
to
take
my
siesta
a
servant
of
brought
me
a
letter
from
his
master
and
fled
before
i
could
read
it
the
letter
contained
an
enclosure
which
i
read
first
it
was
from
baron
de
fraiture
he
asked
manucci
to
lend
him
a
hundred
pistoles
promising
to
shew
him
the
man
whom
he
held
for
his
dearest
friend
to
be
his
worst
enemy
manucci
honouring
me
by
the
way
with
the
title
of
ungrateful
traitor
said
that
the
baron
letter
had
excited
his
curiosity
and
he
had
met
him
in
jerome
park
where
the
baron
had
clearly
proved
this
enemy
to
be
myself
since
i
had
informed
the
baron
that
though
the
name
of
manucci
was
genuine
the
title
of
count
was
quite
apocryphal
after
recapitulating
the
information
which
fraiture
had
given
him
and
which
could
only
have
proceeded
from
myself
he
advised
me
to
leave
madrid
as
soon
as
possible
in
a
week
at
latest
i
can
give
the
reader
no
idea
of
the
shock
this
letter
gave
me
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
had
to
confess
myself
guilty
of
folly
ingratitude
and
crime
i
felt
that
my
fault
was
beyond
forgiveness
and
did
not
think
of
asking
manucci
to
pardon
me
i
could
do
nothing
but
despair
nevertheless
in
spite
of
manucci
just
indignation
i
could
not
help
seeing
that
he
had
made
a
great
mistake
in
advising
me
in
so
insulting
a
manner
to
leave
madrid
in
a
week
the
young
man
might
have
known
that
my
would
forbid
my
following
such
a
piece
of
advice
he
could
not
compel
me
to
obey
his
counsel
or
command
and
to
leave
madrid
would
have
been
to
commit
a
second
baseness
worse
than
the
first
a
prey
to
grief
i
spent
the
day
without
taking
any
steps
one
way
or
the
other
and
i
went
to
bed
without
supping
and
without
the
company
of
donna
ignazia
after
a
sound
sleep
i
got
up
and
wrote
to
the
friend
whom
i
had
offended
a
sincere
and
humble
confession
of
my
fault
i
concluded
my
letter
by
saying
that
i
hoped
that
this
evidence
of
my
sincere
and
heartfelt
repentance
would
suffice
but
if
not
that
i
was
ready
to
give
him
any
honourable
satisfaction
in
my
power
you
may
i
said
have
me
assassinated
if
you
like
but
i
shall
not
leave
madrid
till
its
suits
me
to
do
so
i
put
a
commonplace
seal
on
my
letter
and
had
the
address
written
by
philippe
whose
hand
was
unknown
to
manucci
and
then
i
sent
it
to
pando
where
the
king
had
gone
i
kept
my
room
the
whole
day
and
donna
ignazia
seeing
that
i
had
recovered
my
spirits
to
some
degree
made
no
more
enquiries
about
the
cause
of
my
distress
i
waited
in
the
whole
of
the
next
day
expecting
a
reply
but
in
vain
the
third
day
being
sunday
i
went
out
to
call
on
the
prince
della
catolica
my
carriage
stopped
at
his
door
but
the
porter
came
out
and
told
me
in
a
polite
whisper
that
his
highness
had
his
reasons
for
not
receiving
me
any
longer
this
was
an
unexpected
blow
but
after
it
i
was
prepared
for
anything
i
drove
to
the
abbe
bigliardi
but
the
lackey
after
taking
in
my
name
informed
me
that
his
master
was
out
i
got
into
my
carriage
and
went
to
varnier
who
said
he
wanted
to
speak
to
me
come
into
my
carriage
said
i
we
will
go
and
hear
mass
together
on
our
way
he
told
me
that
the
venetian
ambassador
mocenigo
had
warned
the
duke
of
medina
sidonia
that
i
was
a
dangerous
character
the
duke
he
added
replied
that
he
would
cease
to
know
you
as
soon
as
he
found
out
the
badness
of
your
character
himself
these
three
shocks
following
in
such
quick
succession
cast
me
into
a
state
of
confusion
i
said
nothing
till
we
heard
mass
together
but
i
believe
that
if
i
had
not
then
told
him
the
whole
story
i
should
have
had
an
apoplectic
fit
varnier
pitied
me
and
said
such
are
the
ways
of
the
great
when
they
have
abjured
all
virtue
and
honesty
nevertheless
i
advise
you
to
keep
silence
about
it
unless
you
would
irritate
manucci
still
farther
when
i
got
home
i
wrote
to
manucci
begging
him
to
suspend
his
vengeance
or
else
i
should
be
obliged
to
tell
the
story
to
all
those
who
insulted
me
for
the
ambassador
sake
i
sent
the
letter
to
soderini
the
secretary
of
the
embassy
feeling
sure
that
he
would
forward
it
to
manucci
i
dined
with
my
mistress
and
took
her
to
the
bull
fight
where
i
chanced
to
find
myself
in
a
box
adjoining
that
in
which
manucci
and
the
two
ambassadors
were
seated
i
made
them
a
bow
which
they
were
obliged
to
return
and
did
not
vouchsafe
them
another
glance
for
the
rest
of
the
spectacle
the
next
day
the
marquis
grimaldi
refused
to
receive
me
and
i
saw
that
i
should
have
to
abandon
all
hope
the
duke
of
lossada
remained
my
friend
on
account
of
his
dislike
to
the
ambassador
and
his
unnatural
tastes
but
he
told
me
that
he
had
been
requested
not
to
receive
me
and
that
he
did
not
think
i
had
the
slightest
chance
of
obtaining
any
employment
at
court
i
could
scarcely
believe
in
such
an
extremity
of
vengeance
manucci
was
making
a
parade
of
the
influence
he
possessed
over
his
wife
the
ambassador
in
his
insane
desire
for
revenge
he
had
laid
all
shame
aside
i
was
curious
to
know
whether
he
had
forgotten
don
emmanuel
de
roda
and
the
marquis
de
la
moras
i
found
both
of
them
had
been
forewarned
against
me
there
was
still
the
count
of
aranda
and
i
was
just
going
to
see
him
when
a
servant
of
his
highness
came
and
told
me
that
his
master
wished
to
see
me
i
shuddered
for
in
my
then
state
of
mind
i
drew
the
most
sinister
conclusions
from
the
message
i
found
the
great
man
alone
looking
perfectly
calm
this
made
me
pluck
up
a
heart
he
asked
me
to
sit
down
a
favour
he
had
not
hitherto
done
me
and
this
further
contributed
to
cheer
me
what
have
you
been
doing
to
offend
your
ambassador
he
began
my
lord
i
have
done
nothing
to
him
directly
but
by
an
inexcusable
act
of
stupidity
i
have
wounded
his
dear
friend
manucci
in
his
tenderest
part
with
the
most
innocent
intentions
i
reposed
my
confidence
in
a
cowardly
fellow
who
sold
it
to
manucci
for
a
hundred
pistoles
in
his
irritation
manucci
has
stirred
up
the
great
man
against
me
illae
lacrimae
you
have
been
unwise
but
what
is
done
is
done
i
am
sorry
for
you
because
there
is
an
end
to
all
your
hopes
of
advancement
the
first
thing
the
king
would
do
would
be
to
make
enquiries
about
you
of
the
ambassador
i
feel
it
to
my
sorrow
my
lord
but
must
i
leave
madrid
no
the
ambassador
did
his
best
to
make
me
send
you
way
but
i
told
him
that
i
had
no
power
over
you
so
long
as
you
did
not
infringe
the
laws
has
calumniated
a
venetian
subject
whom
i
am
bound
to
protect
said
he
that
case
i
replied
can
resort
to
the
ordinary
law
and
punish
him
to
the
best
of
your
ability
the
ambassador
finally
begged
me
to
order
you
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
any
venetian
subjects
at
madrid
and
i
think
you
can
safely
promise
me
this
my
lord
i
have
much
pleasure
in
giving
your
excellency
my
word
of
honour
not
to
do
so
very
good
then
you
can
stay
at
madrid
as
long
as
you
please
and
indeed
mocenigo
will
be
leaving
in
the
course
of
a
week
from
that
moment
i
made
up
my
mind
to
amuse
myself
without
any
thought
of
obtaining
a
position
in
spain
however
the
ties
of
friendship
made
me
keep
up
my
acquaintance
with
varnier
the
duke
of
medina
sidonia
and
the
architect
sabatini
who
always
gave
me
a
warm
welcome
as
did
his
wife
donna
ignazia
had
more
of
my
company
than
ever
and
congratulated
me
on
my
freedom
from
the
cares
of
business
after
the
departure
of
mocenigo
i
thought
i
would
go
and
see
if
querini
his
nephew
was
equally
prejudiced
against
me
the
porter
told
me
that
he
had
received
orders
not
to
admit
me
and
i
laughed
in
the
man
face
six
or
seven
weeks
after
manucci
departure
i
too
left
madrid
i
did
so
on
compulsion
in
spite
of
my
love
for
ignazia
for
i
had
no
longer
hopes
of
doing
anything
in
portugal
and
my
purse
was
nearly
exhausted
i
thought
of
selling
a
handsome
repeater
and
a
gold
so
as
to
enable
me
to
go
to
marseilles
whence
i
thought
of
going
to
constantinople
and
trying
my
fortune
there
without
turning
renegade
doubtless
i
should
have
found
the
plan
unsuccessful
for
i
was
attaining
an
age
when
fortune
flies
i
had
no
reason
however
to
complain
of
fortune
for
she
had
been
lavish
in
her
gifts
to
me
and
i
in
my
turn
had
always
abused
them
in
my
state
of
distress
the
learned
abbe
pinzi
introduced
me
to
a
genoese
bookseller
named
carrado
a
thoroughly
honest
man
who
seemed
to
have
been
created
that
the
knavery
of
most
of
the
genoese
might
be
pardoned
to
him
i
brought
my
watch
and
but
the
worthy
carrado
not
only
refused
to
buy
them
but
would
not
take
them
in
pledge
he
gave
me
seventeen
hundred
francs
with
no
other
security
than
my
word
that
i
would
repay
him
if
i
were
ever
able
to
do
so
unhappily
i
have
never
been
able
to
repay
this
debt
unless
my
gratitude
be
accounted
repayment
as
nothing
is
sweeter
than
the
companionship
between
a
man
and
the
woman
he
adores
so
nothing
is
bitterer
than
the
separation
the
pleasure
has
vanished
away
and
only
the
pain
remains
i
spent
my
last
days
at
madrid
drinking
the
cup
of
pleasure
which
was
embittered
by
the
thought
of
the
pain
that
was
to
follow
the
worthy
diego
was
sad
at
the
thought
of
losing
me
and
could
with
difficulty
refrain
from
tears
for
some
time
my
man
philippe
continued
to
give
me
news
of
donna
ignazia
she
became
the
bride
of
a
rich
shoemaker
though
her
father
was
extremely
mortified
by
her
making
a
marriage
so
much
beneath
her
station
i
had
promised
the
marquis
de
las
moras
and
colonel
royas
that
i
would
come
and
see
them
at
saragossa
the
capital
of
aragon
and
i
arrived
there
at
the
beginning
of
september
my
stay
lasted
for
a
fortnight
during
which
time
i
was
able
to
examine
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
aragonese
who
were
not
subject
to
the
ordinances
of
the
marquis
of
aranda
as
long
cloaks
and
low
hats
were
to
be
seen
at
every
corner
they
looked
like
dark
phantoms
more
than
men
for
the
cloak
covered
up
at
least
half
the
face
underneath
the
cloak
was
carried
el
spadino
a
sword
of
enormous
length
persons
who
wore
this
costume
were
treated
with
great
respect
though
they
were
mostly
arrant
rogues
still
they
might
possibly
be
powerful
noblemen
in
disguise
the
visitor
to
saragossa
should
see
the
devotion
which
is
paid
to
our
lady
del
pilar
i
have
seen
processions
going
along
the
streets
in
which
wooden
statues
of
gigantic
proportions
were
carried
i
was
taken
to
the
best
assemblies
where
the
monks
swarmed
i
was
introduced
to
a
lady
of
monstrous
size
who
i
was
informed
was
cousin
to
the
famous
palafox
and
i
did
not
feel
my
bosom
swell
with
pride
as
was
evidently
expected
i
also
made
the
acquaintance
of
canon
pignatelli
a
man
of
italian
origin
he
was
president
of
the
inquisition
and
every
morning
he
imprisoned
the
procuress
who
had
furnished
him
with
the
girl
with
whom
he
had
supped
and
slept
he
would
wake
up
in
the
morning
tired
out
with
the
pleasures
of
the
night
the
girl
would
be
driven
away
and
the
procuress
imprisoned
he
then
dressed
confessed
said
mass
and
after
an
excellent
breakfast
with
plenty
of
good
wine
he
would
send
out
for
another
girl
and
this
would
go
on
day
after
day
nevertheless
he
was
held
in
great
respect
at
saragossa
for
he
was
a
monk
a
canon
and
an
inquisitor
the
bull
fights
were
finer
at
saragossa
than
at
madrid
that
is
to
say
they
were
deadlier
and
the
chief
interest
of
this
barbarous
spectacle
lies
in
the
shedding
of
blood
the
marquis
de
las
moras
and
colonel
royas
gave
me
some
excellent
dinners
the
marquis
was
one
of
the
pleasantest
men
i
met
in
spain
he
died
very
young
two
years
after
the
church
of
nuestra
senora
del
pilar
is
situated
on
the
ramparts
of
the
town
and
the
aragonese
fondly
believe
this
portion
of
the
town
defences
to
be
impregnable
i
had
promised
donna
pelliccia
to
go
and
see
her
at
valentia
and
on
my
way
i
saw
the
ancient
town
of
saguntum
on
a
hill
at
some
little
distance
there
was
a
priest
travelling
with
me
and
i
told
him
and
the
driver
who
preferred
his
mules
to
all
the
antiquities
in
the
world
that
i
should
like
to
go
and
see
the
town
how
the
muleteer
and
the
priest
objected
to
this
proposal
there
are
only
ruins
there
senor
that
just
what
i
want
to
see
we
shall
never
get
to
valentia
here
a
crown
we
shall
get
there
the
crown
settled
everything
and
the
man
exclaimed
valga
me
dios
es
un
hombre
de
buen
so
help
me
god
this
is
an
honest
man
a
subject
of
his
catholic
majesty
knows
no
heartier
praise
than
this
i
saw
the
massive
walls
still
standing
and
in
good
condition
and
yet
they
were
built
during
the
second
punic
war
i
saw
on
two
of
the
gateways
inscriptions
which
to
me
were
meaningless
but
which
seguier
the
old
friend
of
the
marquis
maffei
could
no
doubt
have
deciphered
the
sight
of
this
monument
to
the
courage
of
an
ancient
race
who
preferred
to
perish
in
the
flames
rather
than
surrender
excited
my
awe
and
admiration
the
priest
laughed
at
me
and
i
am
sure
he
would
not
have
purchased
this
venerable
city
of
the
dead
if
he
could
have
done
so
by
saying
a
mass
the
very
name
has
perished
instead
of
saguntum
it
is
called
murviedro
from
the
latin
veteres
old
walls
but
time
that
destroys
marble
and
brass
destroys
also
the
very
memory
of
what
has
been
this
place
said
the
priest
is
always
called
murviedro
it
is
ridiculous
to
do
so
i
replied
common
sense
forbids
us
calling
a
thing
old
which
was
once
young
enough
that
as
if
you
would
tell
me
that
new
castille
is
really
new
well
old
castille
is
more
ancient
than
new
castille
no
so
new
castille
was
only
called
so
because
it
was
the
latest
conquest
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
the
older
of
the
two
the
poor
priest
took
refuge
in
silence
shaking
his
head
and
evidently
taking
me
for
a
madman
i
tried
vainly
to
find
hannibal
head
and
the
inscription
in
honour
of
caesar
claudius
but
i
found
out
the
remains
of
the
amphitheatre
the
next
day
i
remarked
the
mosaic
pavement
which
had
been
discovered
twenty
years
before
i
reached
valentia
at
nine
in
the
morning
and
found
that
i
should
have
to
content
myself
with
a
bad
lodging
as
marescalchi
the
opera
manager
had
taken
all
the
best
rooms
for
the
members
of
his
company
marescalchi
was
accompanied
by
his
brother
a
priest
whom
i
found
decidedly
learned
for
his
age
we
took
a
walk
together
and
he
laughed
when
i
proposed
going
into
a
cafe
for
there
was
not
such
a
thing
in
the
town
there
were
only
taverns
of
the
lowest
class
where
the
wine
is
not
fit
to
drink
i
could
scarcely
believe
it
but
spain
is
a
peculiar
country
when
i
was
at
valentia
a
good
bottle
of
wine
was
scarcely
obtainable
though
malaga
and
alicante
were
both
close
at
hand
in
the
first
three
days
of
my
stay
at
valentia
the
birthplace
of
alexander
vi
i
saw
all
the
objects
of
interest
in
the
town
and
was
confirmed
in
my
idea
that
what
seems
so
admirable
in
the
descriptions
of
writers
and
the
pictures
of
artists
loses
much
of
its
charm
on
actual
inspection
though
valentia
is
blessed
with
an
excellent
climate
though
it
is
well
watered
situated
in
the
midst
of
a
beautiful
country
fertile
in
all
the
choicest
products
of
nature
though
it
is
the
residence
of
many
of
the
most
distinguished
of
the
spanish
nobility
though
its
women
are
the
most
handsome
in
spain
though
it
has
the
advantage
of
being
the
seat
of
an
archbishop
in
spite
of
all
these
commodities
it
is
a
most
disagreeable
town
to
live
in
one
is
ill
lodged
and
ill
fed
there
is
no
good
wine
and
no
good
company
there
is
not
even
any
intellectual
provision
for
though
there
is
a
university
lettered
men
are
absolutely
unknown
as
for
the
bridges
churches
the
arsenal
the
exchange
the
town
hall
the
twelve
town
gates
and
the
rest
i
could
not
take
pleasure
in
a
town
where
the
streets
are
not
paved
and
where
a
public
promenade
is
conspicuous
by
its
absence
outside
the
town
the
country
is
delightful
especially
on
the
side
towards
the
sea
but
the
outside
is
not
the
inside
the
feature
which
pleased
me
most
was
the
number
of
small
vehicles
which
transport
the
traveller
rapidly
from
one
point
to
another
at
a
very
slight
expense
and
will
even
undertake
a
two
or
three
journey
if
my
frame
of
mind
had
been
a
more
pleasant
one
i
should
have
travelled
through
the
kingdoms
of
murcia
and
grenada
which
surpass
italy
in
beauty
and
fertility
poor
spaniards
this
beauty
and
fertility
of
your
land
are
the
cause
of
your
ignorance
as
the
mines
of
peru
and
potosi
have
brought
about
that
foolish
pride
and
all
the
prejudices
which
degrade
you
spaniards
when
will
the
impulse
come
when
will
you
shake
off
that
fatal
lethargy
now
you
are
truly
useless
to
yourselves
and
the
rest
of
the
world
what
is
it
you
need
a
furious
revolution
a
terrible
shock
a
conquest
of
regeneration
your
case
is
past
gentle
methods
it
needs
the
cautery
and
the
fire
the
first
call
i
paid
was
on
donna
pelliccia
the
first
performance
was
to
be
given
in
two
days
this
was
not
a
matter
of
any
difficulty
as
the
same
operas
were
to
be
presented
as
had
been
already
played
at
aranjuez
the
escurial
and
the
granja
for
the
count
of
aranda
would
never
have
dared
to
sanction
the
performance
of
an
italian
comic
opera
at
madrid
the
novelty
would
have
been
too
great
and
the
inquisition
would
have
interfered
the
balls
were
a
considerable
shock
and
two
years
after
they
were
suppressed
spain
will
never
make
any
real
advance
until
the
inquisition
is
suppressed
also
as
soon
as
donna
pelliccia
arrived
she
sent
in
the
letter
of
introduction
she
had
received
from
the
duke
of
arcos
three
months
before
she
had
not
seen
the
duke
since
their
meeting
at
aranjuez
madam
said
don
diego
the
person
to
whom
she
was
commended
i
have
come
to
offer
you
my
services
and
to
tell
you
of
the
orders
his
grace
has
laid
on
me
of
which
you
may
possibly
be
ignorant
i
hope
sir
she
replied
that
i
am
not
putting
you
to
any
inconvenience
but
i
am
extremely
grateful
to
the
duke
and
to
yourself
and
i
shall
have
the
honour
of
calling
on
you
to
give
you
my
thanks
not
at
all
i
have
only
to
say
that
i
have
orders
to
furnish
you
with
any
sums
you
may
require
to
the
amount
of
thousand
doubloons
thousand
doubloons
exactly
madam
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
in
french
money
and
no
more
kindly
read
his
grace
letter
you
do
not
seem
to
be
aware
of
its
contents
the
letter
was
a
brief
one
don
diego
you
will
furnish
donna
pelliccia
with
whatever
sums
she
may
require
not
exceeding
thousand
doubloons
at
my
account
the
duke
dos
arcos
we
remained
in
a
state
of
perfect
stupefaction
donna
pelliccia
returned
the
epistle
to
the
banker
who
bowed
and
took
his
leave
this
sounds
almost
incredible
generosity
but
in
spain
such
things
are
not
uncommon
i
have
already
mentioned
the
munificent
gift
of
to
madame
pichona
those
who
are
unacquainted
with
the
peculiar
spanish
character
and
the
vast
riches
of
some
of
the
nobility
may
pronounce
such
acts
of
generosity
to
be
ridiculous
and
positively
injurious
but
they
make
a
mistake
the
spendthrift
gives
and
squanders
by
a
kind
of
instinct
and
so
he
will
continue
to
do
as
long
as
his
means
remain
but
these
splendid
gifts
i
have
described
do
not
come
under
the
category
of
senseless
prodigality
the
spaniard
is
chiefly
ambitious
of
praise
for
praise
he
will
do
anything
but
this
very
desire
for
admiration
serves
to
restrain
him
from
actions
by
which
he
would
incur
blame
he
wants
to
be
thought
superior
to
his
fellows
as
the
spanish
nation
is
superior
to
all
other
nations
he
wants
to
be
thought
worthy
of
a
throne
and
to
be
considered
as
the
possessor
of
all
the
virtues
i
may
also
note
that
while
some
of
the
spanish
nobility
are
as
rich
as
the
english
lords
the
former
have
not
so
many
ways
of
spending
their
money
as
the
latter
and
thus
are
enabled
to
be
heroically
generous
on
occasion
as
soon
as
don
diego
had
gone
we
began
to
discuss
the
duke
noble
behaviour
donna
pelliccia
maintained
that
the
duke
had
wished
to
shew
his
confidence
in
her
by
doing
her
the
honour
of
supposing
her
incapable
of
abusing
his
generosity
at
all
events
she
concluded
i
would
rather
die
of
hunger
than
take
a
single
doubloon
of
don
diego
the
duke
would
be
offended
said
a
violinist
i
think
you
ought
to
take
something
you
must
take
it
all
said
the
husband
i
was
of
the
lady
opinion
and
told
her
that
i
was
sure
the
duke
would
reward
her
delicacy
by
making
her
fortune
she
followed
my
advice
and
her
own
impulse
though
the
banker
remonstrated
with
her
such
is
the
perversity
of
the
human
mind
that
no
one
believed
in
donna
pelliccia
delicacy
when
the
king
heard
what
had
happened
he
ordered
the
worthy
actress
to
leave
madrid
to
prevent
the
duke
ruining
himself
such
is
often
the
reward
of
virtue
here
below
but
the
malicious
persons
who
had
tried
to
injure
donna
pelliccia
by
calumniating
her
to
the
king
were
the
means
of
making
her
fortune
the
duke
who
had
only
spoken
once
or
twice
to
the
actress
in
public
and
had
never
spent
a
penny
on
her
took
the
king
command
as
an
insult
and
one
not
to
be
borne
he
was
too
proud
to
solicit
the
king
to
revoke
the
order
he
had
given
and
in
the
end
behaved
in
a
way
befitting
so
a
man
for
the
first
time
he
visited
donna
pelliccia
at
her
own
house
and
begging
her
to
forgive
him
for
having
been
the
innocent
cause
of
her
disgrace
asked
her
to
accept
a
rouleau
and
a
letter
which
he
laid
on
the
table
the
rouleau
contained
a
hundred
gold
ounces
with
the
words
for
travelling
expenses
and
the
letter
was
addressed
to
a
roman
bank
and
proved
to
be
an
order
for
thousand
roman
crowns
for
years
this
worthy
woman
kept
an
establishment
at
rome
and
did
so
in
a
manner
which
proved
her
worthy
of
her
good
fortune
the
day
after
donna
pelliccia
departure
the
king
saw
the
duke
of
arcos
and
told
him
not
to
be
sad
but
to
forget
the
woman
who
had
been
sent
away
for
his
own
good
by
sending
her
away
your
majesty
obliged
me
to
turn
fiction
into
fact
for
i
only
knew
her
by
speaking
to
her
in
various
public
places
and
i
had
never
made
her
the
smallest
present
then
you
never
gave
her
thousand
doubloons
sire
i
gave
her
double
that
sum
but
only
on
the
day
before
yesterday
your
majesty
has
absolute
power
but
if
she
had
not
received
her
dismissal
i
should
never
have
gone
to
her
house
nor
should
i
have
given
her
the
smallest
present
the
king
was
stupefied
and
silent
he
was
probably
meditating
on
the
amount
of
credit
a
monarch
should
give
to
the
gossip
that
his
courtiers
bring
him
i
heard
about
this
from
monnino
who
was
afterwards
known
under
the
title
of
castille
de
florida
blanca
and
is
now
living
in
exile
in
murcia
his
native
country
after
marescalchi
had
gone
and
i
was
making
my
preparations
for
my
journey
to
barcelona
i
saw
one
day
at
the
bull
fight
a
woman
whose
appearance
had
a
strange
kind
of
fascination
about
it
there
was
a
knight
of
alcantara
at
my
side
and
i
asked
him
who
the
lady
was
she
is
the
famous
nina
how
famous
if
you
do
not
know
her
story
it
is
too
long
to
be
told
here
i
could
not
help
gazing
at
her
and
two
minutes
later
an
fellow
beside
her
came
up
to
my
companion
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
the
knight
turned
towards
me
and
informed
me
in
the
most
polite
manner
that
the
lady
whose
name
i
had
asked
desired
to
know
mine
i
was
silly
enough
to
be
flattered
by
her
curiosity
and
told
the
messenger
that
if
the
lady
would
allow
me
i
would
come
to
her
box
and
tell
her
my
name
in
person
after
the
performance
from
your
accent
i
should
suppose
you
were
an
italian
i
am
a
venetian
so
is
she
when
he
had
gone
away
my
neighbour
seemed
inclined
to
be
more
communicative
and
informed
me
that
nina
was
a
dancer
whom
the
count
de
ricla
the
viceroy
of
barcelona
was
keeping
for
some
weeks
at
valentia
till
he
could
get
her
back
to
barcelona
whence
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
had
expelled
her
on
account
of
the
scandals
to
which
she
gave
rise
the
count
he
added
is
madly
in
love
with
her
and
allows
her
fifty
doubloons
a
day
i
should
hope
she
does
not
spend
them
she
ca
do
that
but
she
does
not
let
a
day
pass
without
committing
some
expensive
act
of
folly
i
felt
curious
to
know
a
woman
of
such
a
peculiar
character
and
longed
for
the
end
of
the
bull
fight
little
thinking
in
what
trouble
this
new
acquaintance
would
involve
me
she
received
me
with
great
politeness
and
as
she
got
into
her
carriage
drawn
by
six
mules
she
said
she
would
be
delighted
if
i
would
breakfast
with
her
at
nine
on
the
following
day
i
promised
to
come
and
i
kept
my
word
her
house
was
just
outside
the
town
walls
and
was
a
very
large
building
it
was
richly
and
tastefully
furnished
and
was
surrounded
by
an
enormous
garden
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
was
the
number
of
the
lackeys
and
the
richness
of
their
liveries
and
the
maids
in
elegant
attire
who
seemed
to
be
going
and
coming
in
all
directions
as
i
advanced
i
heard
an
imperious
voice
scolding
some
one
the
scold
was
nina
who
was
abusing
an
man
who
was
standing
by
a
large
table
covered
with
stuffs
and
laces
excuse
me
said
she
but
this
fool
of
a
spaniard
wants
to
persuade
me
that
this
lace
is
really
handsome
she
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
the
lace
and
though
i
privately
thought
it
lace
of
the
finest
quality
i
did
not
care
to
contradict
her
and
so
replied
that
i
was
no
judge
madam
said
the
tradesman
if
you
do
not
like
the
lace
leave
it
will
you
keep
the
stuffs
yes
she
replied
and
as
for
the
lace
i
will
shew
you
that
it
is
not
the
money
that
deters
me
so
saying
the
mad
girl
took
up
a
pair
of
scissors
and
cut
the
lace
into
fragments
what
a
pity
said
the
man
who
had
spoken
to
me
at
the
bull
fight
people
will
say
that
you
have
gone
off
your
head
be
silent
you
pimping
rogue
said
she
enforcing
her
words
with
a
sturdy
box
on
the
ear
the
fellow
went
off
calling
her
strumpet
which
only
made
her
scream
with
laughter
then
turning
to
the
spaniard
she
told
him
to
make
out
his
account
directly
the
man
did
not
want
telling
twice
and
avenged
himself
for
the
abuse
he
had
received
by
the
inordinate
length
of
his
bill
she
took
up
the
account
and
placed
her
initials
at
the
bottom
without
deigning
to
look
at
the
items
and
said
go
to
don
diego
valencia
he
will
pay
you
immediately
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
the
chocolate
was
served
and
she
sent
a
message
to
the
fellow
whose
ears
she
had
boxed
to
come
to
breakfast
directly
you
need
be
surprised
at
my
way
of
treating
him
she
said
he
a
rascal
whom
ricla
has
placed
in
my
house
to
spy
out
my
actions
and
i
treat
him
as
you
have
seen
so
that
he
may
have
plenty
of
news
to
write
to
his
master
i
thought
i
must
be
dreaming
such
a
woman
seemed
to
me
beyond
the
limits
of
the
possible
the
poor
wretch
who
came
from
bologna
and
was
a
musician
by
profession
came
and
sat
down
with
us
without
a
word
his
name
was
molinari
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
his
breakfast
he
left
the
room
and
nina
spent
an
hour
with
me
talking
about
spain
italy
and
portugal
where
she
had
married
a
dancer
named
bergonzi
my
father
she
said
was
the
famous
charlatan
pelandi
you
may
have
known
him
at
venice
after
this
piece
of
confidence
and
she
did
not
seem
at
all
ashamed
of
her
parentage
she
asked
me
to
sup
with
her
supper
being
her
favourite
meal
i
promised
to
come
and
i
left
her
to
reflect
on
the
extraordinary
character
of
the
woman
and
on
the
good
fortune
which
she
so
abused
nina
was
wonderfully
beautiful
but
as
it
has
always
been
my
opinion
that
mere
beauty
does
not
go
for
much
i
could
not
understand
how
a
viceroy
could
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
to
such
an
extent
as
for
molinari
after
which
i
had
seen
i
could
only
set
him
down
as
an
infamous
wretch
i
went
to
supper
with
her
for
amusement
sake
for
with
all
her
beauty
she
had
not
touched
my
heart
in
the
slightest
degree
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
october
but
at
valentia
the
thermometer
marked
twenty
degrees
reaumur
in
the
shade
nina
was
walking
in
the
garden
with
her
companion
both
of
them
being
very
lightly
clad
indeed
nina
had
only
her
chemise
and
a
light
petticoat
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
she
came
up
and
begged
me
to
follow
their
example
in
the
way
of
attire
but
i
begged
to
be
excused
the
presence
of
that
hateful
fellow
revolted
me
in
the
highest
degree
in
the
interval
before
supper
nina
entertained
me
with
a
number
of
lascivious
anecdotes
of
her
experiences
from
the
time
she
began
her
present
mode
of
living
up
to
the
age
of
which
was
her
age
then
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
presence
of
the
disgusting
argus
no
doubt
all
these
stories
would
have
produced
their
natural
effect
on
me
but
as
it
was
they
had
none
whatever
we
had
a
delicate
supper
and
ate
with
appetite
and
after
it
was
over
i
would
have
gladly
left
them
but
nina
would
not
let
me
go
the
wine
had
taken
effect
and
she
wished
to
have
a
little
amusement
after
all
the
servants
had
been
dismissed
this
messalina
ordered
molinari
to
strip
naked
and
she
then
began
to
treat
him
in
a
manner
which
i
can
not
describe
without
disgust
the
rascal
was
young
and
strong
and
though
he
was
drunk
treatment
soon
placed
him
in
a
hearty
condition
i
could
see
that
she
wished
me
to
play
my
part
in
the
revels
but
my
disgust
had
utterly
deprived
me
of
all
my
amorous
faculties
nina
too
had
undressed
and
seeing
that
i
viewed
the
orgy
coldly
she
proceeded
to
satiate
her
desires
by
means
of
molinari
i
had
to
bear
with
the
sight
of
this
beautiful
woman
coupling
herself
with
an
animal
whose
only
merit
lay
in
his
virile
monstrosity
which
she
no
doubt
regarded
as
a
beauty
when
she
had
exhausted
her
amorous
fury
she
threw
herself
into
a
bath
then
came
back
drank
a
bottle
of
malmsey
madeira
and
finally
made
her
brutal
lover
drink
till
he
fell
on
to
the
floor
i
fled
into
the
next
room
not
being
able
to
bear
it
any
longer
but
she
followed
me
she
was
still
naked
and
seating
herself
beside
me
on
an
ottoman
she
asked
me
how
i
had
enjoyed
the
spectacle
i
told
her
boldy
that
the
disgust
with
which
her
wretched
companion
had
inspired
me
was
so
great
that
it
had
utterly
annulled
the
effect
of
her
charms
that
may
be
so
but
now
he
is
not
here
and
yet
you
do
nothing
one
would
not
think
it
to
look
at
you
you
are
right
for
i
have
my
feelings
like
any
other
man
but
he
has
disgusted
me
too
much
wait
till
tomorrow
and
let
me
not
see
that
monster
so
unworthy
of
enjoying
you
he
does
not
enjoy
me
if
i
thought
he
did
i
would
rather
die
than
let
him
have
to
do
with
me
for
i
detest
him
what
you
do
not
love
him
and
yet
you
make
use
of
him
in
the
way
you
do
yes
just
as
i
might
use
a
mechanical
instrument
in
this
woman
i
saw
an
instance
of
the
depths
of
degradation
to
which
human
nature
may
be
brought
she
asked
me
to
sup
with
her
on
the
following
day
telling
me
that
we
would
be
alone
as
molinari
would
be
he
will
have
got
over
the
effects
of
the
wine
i
tell
you
he
will
be
come
and
come
every
evening
i
am
going
the
day
after
you
will
not
go
for
a
week
and
then
we
will
go
together
that
impossible
if
you
go
you
will
insult
me
beyond
bearing
i
went
home
with
my
mind
made
up
to
depart
without
having
anything
more
to
do
with
her
and
though
i
was
far
from
inexperienced
in
wickedness
of
all
kinds
i
could
not
help
feeling
astonished
at
the
unblushing
frankness
of
this
megaera
who
had
told
me
what
i
already
knew
but
in
words
that
i
had
never
heard
a
woman
use
before
i
only
use
him
to
satisfy
my
desires
and
because
i
am
certain
that
he
does
not
love
me
if
i
thought
he
did
i
would
rather
die
than
allow
him
to
do
anything
with
me
for
i
detest
him
the
next
day
i
went
to
her
at
seven
in
the
evening
she
received
me
with
an
air
of
feigned
melancholy
saying
alas
we
shall
have
to
sup
alone
molinari
has
got
the
colic
you
said
he
would
be
ill
have
you
poisoned
him
i
am
quite
capable
of
doing
so
but
i
hope
i
never
shall
but
you
have
given
him
something
only
what
he
likes
himself
but
we
will
talk
of
that
again
let
us
sup
and
play
till
and
tomorrow
evening
we
will
begin
again
i
am
going
away
at
seven
no
no
you
are
not
and
your
coachman
will
have
no
cause
for
complaint
for
he
has
been
paid
here
is
the
receipt
these
remarks
delivered
with
an
air
of
amorous
despotism
flattered
my
vanity
i
made
up
my
mind
to
submit
gaily
called
her
wanton
and
said
i
was
not
worth
the
pains
she
was
taking
over
me
what
astonishes
me
said
i
is
that
with
this
fine
house
you
do
not
care
to
entertain
company
everybody
is
afraid
to
come
they
fear
ricla
jealousy
for
it
is
well
known
that
that
animal
who
is
now
suffering
from
the
colic
tells
him
everything
i
do
he
swears
that
it
is
not
so
but
i
know
him
to
be
a
liar
indeed
i
am
very
glad
he
does
write
to
ricla
and
only
wish
he
had
something
of
real
importance
to
write
about
he
will
tell
him
that
i
have
supped
alone
with
you
all
the
better
are
you
afraid
no
but
i
think
you
ought
to
tell
me
if
i
have
anything
really
to
fear
nothing
at
all
it
will
fall
on
me
but
i
should
not
like
to
involve
you
in
a
dispute
which
might
be
prejudicial
to
your
interests
not
at
all
the
more
i
provoke
him
the
better
he
loves
me
and
i
will
make
him
pay
dearly
when
he
asks
me
to
make
it
up
then
you
do
love
him
yes
to
ruin
him
but
he
is
so
rich
that
there
does
seem
much
hope
of
my
ever
doing
that
before
me
i
saw
a
woman
as
beautiful
as
venus
and
as
degraded
as
lucifer
a
woman
most
surely
born
to
be
the
ruin
of
anyone
who
had
the
misfortune
to
fall
in
love
with
her
i
had
known
women
of
similar
character
but
never
one
so
dangerous
as
she
i
determined
to
make
some
money
out
of
her
if
i
could
she
called
for
cards
and
asked
me
to
play
with
her
at
a
game
called
primiera
it
is
a
game
of
chance
but
of
so
complicated
a
nature
that
the
best
player
always
wins
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
found
that
i
was
the
better
player
but
she
had
such
luck
that
at
the
end
of
the
game
i
had
lost
twenty
pistoles
which
i
paid
on
the
spot
she
took
the
money
promising
to
give
me
my
revenge
we
had
supper
and
then
we
committed
all
the
wantonness
she
wished
and
i
was
capable
of
performing
for
with
me
the
age
of
miracles
was
past
the
next
day
i
called
to
see
her
earlier
in
the
evening
we
played
again
and
she
lost
and
went
on
losing
evening
after
evening
till
i
had
won
a
matter
of
two
or
three
hundred
doubloons
no
unwelcome
addition
to
my
somewhat
depleted
purse
the
spy
recovered
from
his
colic
and
supped
with
us
every
evening
but
his
presence
no
longer
interfered
with
my
pleasure
since
nina
had
ceased
to
prostitute
herself
to
him
in
my
presence
she
did
the
opposite
giving
herself
to
me
and
telling
him
to
write
to
the
comte
de
ricla
whatever
he
liked
the
count
wrote
her
a
letter
which
she
gave
me
to
read
the
poor
viceroy
informed
her
that
she
might
safely
return
to
barcelona
as
the
bishop
had
received
an
order
from
the
court
to
regard
her
as
merely
au
actress
whose
stay
in
his
diocese
would
only
be
temporary
she
would
thus
be
allowed
to
live
there
in
peace
so
long
as
she
abstained
from
giving
cause
for
scandal
she
told
me
that
whilst
she
was
at
barcelona
i
could
only
see
her
after
ten
at
night
when
the
count
always
left
her
she
assured
me
that
i
should
run
no
risk
whatever
possibly
i
should
not
have
stayed
at
barcelona
at
all
if
nina
had
not
told
me
that
she
would
always
be
ready
to
lend
me
as
much
money
as
i
wanted
she
asked
me
to
leave
valentia
a
day
before
her
and
to
await
her
at
tarragona
i
did
so
and
spent
a
very
pleasant
day
in
that
town
which
abounds
in
remains
of
antiquity
i
ordered
a
choice
supper
according
to
her
instructions
and
took
care
that
she
should
have
a
separate
bedroom
so
as
to
avoid
any
scandal
she
started
in
the
morning
begging
me
to
wait
till
the
evening
and
to
travel
by
night
so
as
to
reach
barcelona
by
she
told
me
to
put
up
at
the
santa
maria
and
not
to
call
till
i
had
heard
from
her
i
followed
all
the
directions
given
me
by
this
curious
woman
and
found
myself
comfortably
lodged
at
barcelona
my
landlord
was
a
swiss
who
told
me
in
confidence
that
he
had
received
instructions
to
treat
me
well
and
that
i
had
only
to
ask
for
what
i
wanted
we
shall
see
soon
what
was
the
result
of
all
this
chapter
viii
my
imprudence
passano
i
am
imprisoned
my
departure
from
barcelona
madame
castelbajac
at
montpellier
nimes
i
arrive
at
aix
although
my
swiss
landlord
seemed
an
honest
and
trustworthy
kind
of
man
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
nina
had
acted
very
imprudently
in
commending
me
to
him
she
was
the
viceroy
mistress
and
though
the
viceroy
might
be
a
very
agreeable
man
he
was
a
spaniard
and
not
likely
to
be
in
his
love
affairs
nina
herself
had
told
me
that
he
was
ardent
jealous
and
suspicious
but
the
mischief
was
done
and
there
was
no
help
for
it
when
i
got
up
my
landlord
brought
me
a
valet
de
place
for
whose
character
he
said
he
could
answer
and
he
then
sent
up
an
excellent
dinner
i
had
slept
till
three
in
the
afternoon
after
dinner
i
summoned
my
host
and
asked
him
whether
nina
had
told
him
to
get
me
a
servant
he
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
added
that
a
carriage
was
awaiting
my
commands
at
the
door
it
had
been
taken
by
the
week
i
am
astonished
to
hear
it
for
no
one
but
myself
can
say
what
i
can
afford
or
not
sir
everything
is
paid
for
paid
for
i
will
not
have
it
you
can
settle
that
with
her
but
i
shall
certainly
take
no
payment
i
saw
dangers
ahead
but
as
i
have
never
cared
to
cherish
forbodings
i
dismissed
the
idea
i
had
a
letter
of
introduction
from
the
marquis
de
las
moras
to
don
miguel
de
cevallos
and
another
from
colonel
royas
to
don
diego
de
la
secada
i
took
my
letters
and
the
next
day
don
diego
came
to
see
me
and
took
me
to
the
comte
de
peralda
the
day
after
don
miguel
introduced
me
to
the
comte
de
ricla
viceroy
of
catalonia
and
the
lover
of
nina
the
comte
de
peralada
was
a
young
man
with
a
pleasant
face
but
with
an
body
he
was
a
great
debauchee
and
lover
of
bad
company
an
enemy
of
religion
morality
and
law
he
was
directly
descended
from
the
comte
de
peralada
who
served
philip
ii
so
well
that
this
king
declared
him
count
by
the
grace
of
god
the
original
patent
of
nobility
was
the
first
thing
i
saw
in
his
antechamber
where
it
was
framed
and
glazed
so
that
all
visitors
might
see
it
in
the
quarter
of
an
hour
they
were
kept
waiting
the
count
received
me
with
an
easy
and
cordiale
manner
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
renounced
all
the
dignities
of
his
rank
he
thanked
don
diego
for
introducing
me
and
talked
a
good
deal
about
colonel
royas
he
asked
me
if
i
had
seen
the
english
girl
he
was
keeping
at
saragossa
and
on
my
replying
in
the
affirmative
he
told
me
in
a
whisper
that
he
had
slept
with
her
he
took
me
to
his
stables
where
he
had
some
splendid
horses
and
then
asked
me
to
dine
with
him
the
next
day
the
viceroy
received
me
in
a
very
different
manner
he
stood
up
so
that
he
might
not
have
to
offer
me
a
chair
and
though
i
spoke
italian
with
which
language
i
knew
him
to
be
well
acquainted
he
answered
me
in
spanish
styling
me
a
contraction
of
senoria
your
lordship
and
used
by
everyone
in
spain
while
i
gave
him
his
proper
title
of
excellence
he
talked
a
good
deal
about
madrid
and
complained
that
de
mocenigo
had
gone
to
paris
by
bayonne
instead
of
barcelona
as
he
had
promised
him
i
tried
to
excuse
my
ambassador
by
saying
that
by
taking
the
other
route
he
had
saved
fifty
leagues
of
his
journey
but
the
viceroy
replied
that
la
palabra
keeping
to
one
words
comes
before
all
else
he
asked
me
if
i
thought
of
staying
long
at
barcelona
and
seemed
surprised
when
i
told
him
that
with
his
leave
i
hoped
to
make
a
long
stay
i
hope
you
will
enjoy
yourself
he
said
but
i
must
warn
you
that
if
you
indulge
in
the
pleasures
which
my
nephew
peralada
will
doubtless
offer
you
you
will
not
enjoy
a
very
good
reputation
at
barcelona
as
the
comte
de
ricla
made
this
observation
in
public
i
thought
myself
justified
in
communicating
it
to
peralada
himself
he
was
delighted
and
told
me
with
evident
vanity
that
he
had
gone
to
madrid
three
times
and
had
been
ordered
to
return
to
catalonia
on
each
occasion
i
thought
my
best
plan
would
be
to
follow
the
viceroy
indirect
advice
so
i
refused
to
join
in
any
of
the
little
parties
of
pleasure
which
peralada
proposed
on
the
fifth
day
after
my
arrival
an
officer
came
to
ask
me
to
dinner
at
the
viceroy
i
accepted
the
invitation
with
much
pleasure
for
i
had
been
afraid
of
the
viceroy
having
heard
of
my
relations
with
nina
and
thought
it
possible
that
he
might
have
taken
a
dislike
to
me
he
was
very
pleasant
to
me
at
dinner
often
addressing
his
observations
to
me
but
always
in
a
tone
of
great
gravity
i
had
been
in
barcelona
for
a
week
and
was
beginning
to
wonder
why
i
had
not
heard
from
nina
but
one
evening
she
wrote
me
a
note
begging
me
to
come
on
foot
and
alone
to
her
house
at
ten
the
same
night
if
i
had
been
wise
i
should
not
have
gone
for
i
was
not
in
love
with
the
woman
and
should
have
remembered
the
respect
due
to
the
viceroy
but
i
was
devoid
of
all
wisdom
and
prudence
all
the
misfortunes
i
have
experienced
in
my
long
life
never
taught
me
those
two
most
necessary
virtues
at
the
hour
she
had
named
i
called
on
her
wearing
my
great
coat
and
with
a
sword
for
my
only
weapon
i
found
nina
with
her
sister
a
woman
of
or
thereabouts
who
was
married
to
an
italian
dancer
nicknamed
schizza
because
he
had
a
flatter
nose
than
any
tartar
nina
had
just
been
supping
with
her
lover
who
had
left
her
at
ten
according
to
his
invariable
custom
she
said
she
was
delighted
to
hear
i
had
been
to
dinner
with
him
as
she
had
herself
spoken
to
him
in
my
praise
saying
how
admirably
i
had
kept
her
company
at
valentia
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
but
i
do
not
think
you
are
wise
in
inviting
me
to
your
house
at
such
late
hours
i
only
do
so
to
avoid
scandal
amongst
my
neighbours
in
my
opinion
my
coming
so
late
is
only
likely
to
increase
the
probability
of
scandal
and
to
make
your
viceroy
jealous
he
will
never
hear
of
your
coming
i
think
you
are
mistaken
i
went
away
at
midnight
after
a
conversation
of
the
most
decent
character
her
sister
did
not
leave
us
for
a
moment
and
nina
gave
her
no
cause
to
suspect
the
intimacy
of
our
relations
i
went
to
see
her
every
evening
without
encroaching
on
the
preserves
i
thought
myself
secure
but
the
following
warning
should
have
made
me
desist
if
i
had
not
been
carried
away
by
the
forces
of
destiny
and
obstinacy
in
combination
an
officer
in
the
walloon
guards
accosted
me
one
day
as
i
was
walking
by
myself
just
outside
the
town
he
begged
me
in
the
most
polite
manner
to
excuse
him
if
he
spoke
on
a
matter
which
was
indifferent
to
him
but
of
great
consequence
to
me
speak
sir
i
replied
i
will
take
whatever
you
say
in
good
part
very
good
you
are
a
stranger
sir
and
may
not
be
acquainted
with
our
spanish
manners
consequently
you
are
unaware
of
the
great
risk
you
run
in
going
to
see
nina
every
evening
after
the
count
has
left
her
what
risk
do
i
run
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
count
knows
all
about
it
and
does
not
object
i
have
no
doubt
as
to
his
knowing
it
and
he
may
possibly
pretend
to
know
nothing
before
her
as
he
fears
as
well
as
loves
her
but
if
she
tells
you
that
he
does
not
object
she
either
deceives
herself
or
you
he
can
not
love
her
without
being
jealous
and
a
jealous
spaniard
follow
my
advice
sir
and
forgive
my
freedom
i
am
sincerely
obliged
to
you
for
your
kind
interest
in
me
but
i
can
not
follow
your
advice
as
by
doing
so
i
should
be
wanting
in
politeness
to
nina
who
likes
to
see
me
and
gives
me
a
warm
welcome
i
shall
continue
to
visit
her
till
she
orders
me
not
to
do
so
or
till
the
count
signifies
to
me
his
displeasure
at
my
visits
to
his
mistress
the
count
will
never
do
such
a
thing
he
is
too
careful
of
his
dignity
the
worthy
officer
then
narrated
to
me
all
the
acts
of
injustice
which
ricla
had
committed
since
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
this
woman
he
had
dismissed
gentlemen
from
his
service
on
the
mere
suspicion
that
they
were
in
love
with
her
some
had
been
exiled
and
others
imprisoned
on
one
frivolous
pretext
or
another
before
he
had
known
nina
he
had
been
a
pattern
of
wisdom
justice
and
virtue
and
now
he
had
become
unjust
cruel
blindly
passionate
and
in
every
way
a
scandal
to
the
high
position
he
occupied
all
this
should
have
influenced
me
but
it
had
not
the
slightest
effect
i
told
him
for
politeness
sake
that
i
would
endeavour
to
part
from
her
by
degrees
but
i
had
no
intention
of
doing
so
when
i
asked
him
how
he
knew
that
i
visited
nina
he
laughed
and
said
it
was
a
common
topic
of
conversation
all
over
the
town
the
same
evening
i
called
on
her
without
mentioning
my
conversation
with
the
officer
there
would
have
been
some
excuse
for
me
if
i
had
been
in
love
with
her
but
as
it
was
i
acted
like
a
madman
on
the
of
november
i
went
to
see
her
at
the
usual
time
i
found
her
with
a
man
who
was
shewing
her
miniatures
i
looked
at
him
and
found
that
he
was
the
scoundrel
passano
or
pogomas
my
blood
boiled
i
took
nina
hand
and
led
her
into
a
neighbouring
room
and
told
her
to
dismiss
the
rogue
at
once
or
i
would
go
to
return
no
more
he
a
painter
i
am
well
acquainted
with
his
history
and
will
tell
you
all
about
it
presently
but
send
him
away
or
i
shall
go
she
called
her
sister
and
told
her
to
order
the
genoese
to
leave
the
house
and
never
to
enter
it
again
the
thing
was
in
a
moment
but
the
sister
told
us
that
as
he
went
out
he
had
said
se
ne
pentira
he
shall
be
sorry
for
i
occupied
an
hour
in
relating
some
of
the
injuries
i
had
received
from
this
scoundrelly
fellow
the
next
day
november
i
went
to
nina
at
the
usual
time
and
after
spending
two
hours
in
pleasant
converse
with
her
and
her
sister
i
went
out
as
the
clocks
were
striking
midnight
the
door
of
the
house
was
under
an
arcade
which
extended
to
the
end
of
the
street
it
was
a
dark
night
and
i
had
scarcely
gone
paces
when
two
men
suddenly
rushed
at
me
i
stepped
back
drawing
my
sword
and
exclaiming
assassins
and
then
with
a
rapid
movement
i
thrust
my
blade
into
the
body
of
the
nearest
assailant
i
then
left
the
arcade
and
began
to
run
down
the
street
the
second
assassin
fired
a
pistol
at
me
but
it
fortunately
missed
me
i
fell
down
and
dropped
my
hat
in
my
rapid
flight
and
got
up
and
continued
my
course
without
troubling
to
pick
it
up
i
did
not
know
whether
i
was
wounded
or
not
but
at
last
i
got
to
my
inn
and
laid
down
the
bloody
sword
on
the
counter
under
the
landlord
nose
i
was
quite
out
of
breath
i
told
the
landlord
what
had
happened
and
on
taking
off
my
great
coat
i
found
it
to
be
pierced
in
two
places
just
below
the
armpit
i
am
going
to
bed
i
said
to
the
landlord
and
i
leave
my
great
coat
and
the
sword
in
your
charge
tomorrow
morning
i
shall
ask
you
to
come
with
me
before
the
magistrate
to
denounce
this
act
of
assassination
for
if
the
man
was
killed
it
must
be
shewn
that
i
only
slew
him
to
save
my
own
life
i
think
your
best
plan
would
be
to
fly
barcelona
immediately
then
you
think
i
have
not
told
you
the
strict
truth
i
am
sure
you
have
but
i
know
whence
the
blow
comes
and
god
knows
what
will
befall
you
nothing
at
all
but
if
i
fly
i
shall
be
accounted
guilty
take
care
of
the
sword
they
tried
to
assassinate
me
but
i
think
the
assassins
got
the
worst
of
it
i
went
to
bed
somewhat
perturbed
but
i
had
the
consoling
thought
that
if
i
had
killed
a
man
i
had
done
so
to
my
conscience
was
quite
clear
at
seven
the
next
morning
i
heard
a
knocking
at
my
door
i
opened
it
and
saw
my
landlord
accompanied
by
an
officer
who
told
me
to
give
him
all
my
papers
to
dress
and
to
follow
him
adding
that
he
should
be
compelled
to
use
force
in
case
of
resistance
i
have
no
intention
of
resisting
i
replied
by
whose
authority
do
you
ask
me
for
my
papers
by
the
authority
of
the
governor
they
will
be
returned
to
you
if
nothing
suspicious
is
found
amongst
them
where
are
you
going
to
take
me
to
the
citadel
i
opened
my
trunk
took
out
my
linen
and
my
clothes
which
i
gave
to
my
landlord
and
i
saw
the
officer
astonishment
at
seeing
my
trunk
half
filled
with
papers
these
are
all
the
papers
i
have
i
said
i
locked
the
box
and
gave
the
officer
the
key
i
advise
you
sir
he
said
to
put
all
necessary
articles
into
a
portmanteau
he
then
ordered
the
landlord
to
send
me
a
bed
and
finally
asked
me
if
i
had
any
papers
in
my
pockets
only
my
passports
that
exactly
what
we
want
he
rejoined
with
a
grim
smile
my
passports
are
sacred
i
will
never
give
them
to
anyone
but
the
reverence
your
king
here
is
his
passport
here
is
that
of
the
count
of
aranda
and
here
the
passport
of
the
venetian
ambassador
you
will
have
to
bind
me
hand
and
foot
before
you
get
them
be
more
moderate
sir
in
giving
them
to
me
it
is
just
as
if
you
gave
them
to
the
viceroy
if
you
resist
i
will
not
bind
you
hand
and
foot
but
i
shall
take
you
before
the
viceroy
and
then
you
will
be
forced
to
give
them
up
in
public
give
them
to
me
with
a
good
grace
and
you
shall
have
an
acknowledgement
the
worthy
landlord
told
me
i
should
be
wiser
to
give
in
so
i
let
myself
be
persuaded
the
officer
gave
me
a
full
quittance
which
i
put
in
my
pocketbook
this
he
let
me
keep
out
of
his
kindness
and
then
i
followed
him
he
had
six
constables
with
him
but
they
kept
a
good
distance
away
comparing
this
with
the
circumstances
of
my
arrest
at
madrid
i
thought
myself
well
treated
before
we
left
the
inn
the
officer
told
me
that
i
might
order
what
meals
i
pleased
and
i
asked
the
landlord
to
let
me
have
my
dinner
and
supper
as
usual
on
the
way
i
told
him
of
my
adventure
of
the
night
before
he
listened
attentively
but
made
no
comments
when
we
reached
the
citadel
i
was
delivered
to
the
officer
of
the
guard
who
gave
me
a
room
on
the
first
floor
it
was
bare
of
furniture
but
the
windows
looked
on
to
a
square
and
had
no
iron
bars
i
had
scarcely
been
there
ten
minutes
when
my
carpet
bag
and
an
excellent
bed
were
brought
in
as
soon
as
i
was
alone
i
began
to
think
over
the
situation
i
finished
where
i
ought
to
have
begun
what
can
this
imprisonment
have
to
do
with
my
last
night
adventure
i
reflected
i
could
not
make
out
the
connection
they
are
bent
on
examining
my
papers
they
must
think
i
have
been
tampering
in
some
political
or
religious
intrigue
but
my
mind
is
quite
at
ease
on
that
score
i
am
well
lodged
at
present
and
no
doubt
shall
be
set
free
after
my
papers
have
been
examined
they
can
find
nothing
against
me
there
the
affair
of
my
attempted
assassination
will
no
doubt
be
considered
separately
even
if
the
rascal
is
dead
i
do
not
see
what
they
can
do
to
me
on
the
other
hand
my
landlord
advice
to
fly
from
barcelona
looks
ominous
what
if
the
assassins
received
their
orders
from
some
person
high
in
authority
it
is
possible
that
ricla
may
have
vowed
my
ruin
but
it
does
not
seem
probable
to
me
would
it
have
been
wise
to
follow
the
landlord
advice
possibly
but
i
do
not
think
so
my
honour
would
have
suffered
and
i
might
have
been
caught
and
laid
up
in
some
horrid
dungeon
whereas
for
a
prison
i
am
comfortable
enough
here
in
three
or
four
days
the
examination
of
my
papers
will
have
been
completed
and
as
there
is
nothing
in
them
likely
to
be
offensive
to
the
powers
that
be
they
will
be
returned
to
me
with
my
liberty
which
will
taste
all
the
sweeter
for
this
short
deprivation
as
for
my
passports
they
all
speak
in
my
favour
i
can
not
think
that
the
hand
of
the
viceroy
could
have
directed
the
assassin
sword
it
would
be
a
dishonour
to
him
and
if
it
were
so
he
would
not
be
treating
me
so
kindly
now
if
it
were
his
doing
he
must
have
heard
directly
that
the
blow
had
failed
and
in
that
case
i
do
not
think
he
would
have
arrested
me
this
morning
shall
i
write
to
nina
will
writing
be
allowed
here
as
i
was
puzzling
my
brains
with
these
reflections
stretched
on
my
bed
for
i
had
no
chair
i
heard
some
disturbance
and
on
opening
my
window
i
saw
to
my
great
astonishment
passano
being
brought
into
the
prison
by
a
corporal
and
two
soldiers
as
he
was
going
in
the
rascal
looked
up
and
saw
me
and
began
to
laugh
alas
i
said
to
myself
here
is
fresh
food
for
conjecture
the
fellow
told
nina
sister
that
i
should
be
sorry
for
what
i
had
done
he
must
have
directed
some
fearful
calumny
against
me
and
they
are
imprisoning
him
so
as
to
be
sure
of
his
evidence
on
reflection
i
was
well
pleased
at
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
an
excellent
dinner
was
set
before
me
but
i
had
no
chair
or
table
the
deficiency
was
remedied
by
the
soldier
who
was
in
charge
of
me
for
the
consideration
of
a
duro
prisoners
were
not
allowed
to
have
pen
and
ink
without
special
permission
but
paper
and
pencils
were
not
included
under
this
regulation
so
my
guard
got
them
for
me
together
with
candles
and
candlesticks
and
i
proceeded
to
kill
time
by
making
geometrical
calculations
i
made
the
obliging
soldier
sup
with
me
and
he
promised
to
commend
me
to
one
of
his
comrades
who
would
serve
me
well
the
guard
was
relieved
at
eleven
on
the
fourth
day
the
officer
of
the
guard
came
to
me
with
a
distressed
look
and
told
me
that
he
had
the
disagreeable
duty
of
giving
me
some
very
bad
news
what
is
that
sir
i
have
received
orders
to
transfer
you
to
the
bottom
of
the
tower
to
transfer
me
yes
then
they
must
have
discovered
in
me
a
criminal
of
the
deepest
dye
let
us
go
at
once
i
found
myself
in
a
kind
of
round
cellar
paved
with
large
flagstones
and
lighted
by
five
or
six
narrow
slits
in
the
walls
the
officer
told
me
i
must
order
what
food
required
to
be
brought
once
a
day
as
no
one
was
allowed
to
come
into
the
or
dungeon
by
night
how
about
lights
you
may
lave
one
lamp
always
burning
and
that
will
be
enough
as
books
are
not
allowed
when
your
dinner
is
brought
the
officer
on
duty
will
open
the
pies
and
the
poultry
to
see
that
they
do
not
contain
any
documents
for
here
no
letters
are
allowed
to
come
in
or
go
out
have
these
orders
been
given
for
my
especial
benefit
no
sir
it
is
the
ordinary
rule
you
will
be
able
to
converse
with
the
sentinel
the
door
will
be
open
then
not
at
all
how
about
the
cleanliness
of
my
cell
a
soldier
will
accompany
the
officer
in
charge
of
your
dinner
and
he
will
attend
to
your
wants
for
a
trifle
may
i
amuse
myself
by
making
architectural
plans
with
the
pencil
as
much
as
you
like
then
will
you
be
good
enough
to
order
some
paper
to
be
bought
for
me
with
pleasure
the
officer
seemed
to
pity
me
as
he
left
me
and
bolted
and
barred
the
heavy
door
behind
which
i
saw
a
man
standing
sentry
with
his
bayonet
fixed
the
door
was
fitted
with
a
small
iron
grating
when
i
got
my
paper
and
my
dinner
at
noonday
the
officer
cut
open
a
fowl
and
plunged
a
fork
in
the
other
dishes
so
as
to
make
sure
that
there
were
no
papers
at
the
bottom
my
dinner
would
have
sufficed
for
six
people
i
told
the
officer
that
i
should
be
much
honoured
by
his
dining
with
me
but
he
replied
that
it
was
strictly
forbidden
he
gave
me
the
same
answer
when
i
asked
if
i
might
have
the
newspapers
it
was
a
festival
time
for
the
sentinels
as
i
shared
my
meals
and
my
good
wine
with
them
and
consequently
these
poor
fellows
were
firmly
attached
to
me
i
was
curious
to
know
who
was
paying
for
my
good
cheer
but
there
was
no
chance
of
my
finding
out
for
the
waiter
from
the
inn
was
never
allowed
to
approach
my
cell
in
this
dungeon
where
i
was
imprisoned
for
days
i
wrote
in
pencil
and
without
other
reference
than
my
memory
my
refutation
of
amelot
de
la
houssaye
history
of
the
venetian
government
i
was
most
heartily
amused
during
my
imprisonment
and
in
the
following
manner
while
i
was
at
warsaw
an
italian
named
tadini
came
to
warsaw
he
had
an
introduction
to
tomatis
who
commended
him
to
me
he
called
himself
an
oculist
tomatis
used
to
give
him
a
dinner
now
and
again
but
not
being
well
off
in
those
days
i
could
only
give
him
good
words
and
a
cup
of
coffee
when
he
chanced
to
come
about
my
tadini
talked
to
everybody
about
the
operations
he
had
performed
and
condemned
an
oculist
who
had
been
at
warsaw
for
twenty
years
saying
that
he
did
not
understand
how
to
extract
a
cataract
while
the
other
oculist
said
that
tadini
was
a
charlatan
who
did
not
know
how
the
eye
was
made
tadini
begged
me
to
speak
in
his
favour
to
a
lady
who
had
had
a
cataract
removed
by
the
warsaw
oculist
only
to
return
again
a
short
time
after
the
operation
the
lady
was
blind
of
the
one
eye
but
she
could
see
with
the
other
and
i
told
tadini
that
i
did
not
care
to
meddle
with
such
a
delicate
matter
i
have
spoken
to
the
lady
said
tadini
and
i
have
mentioned
your
name
as
a
person
who
will
answer
for
me
you
have
done
wrong
in
such
a
matter
i
would
not
stand
surety
for
the
most
learned
of
men
and
i
know
nothing
about
your
learning
but
you
know
i
am
an
oculist
i
know
you
were
introduced
to
me
as
such
but
that
all
as
a
professional
man
you
should
not
need
anyone
commendation
you
should
be
able
to
say
credite
that
should
be
your
motto
tadini
was
vexed
with
my
incredulity
and
shewed
me
a
number
of
testimonials
which
i
might
possibly
have
read
if
the
first
which
met
my
eye
had
not
been
from
a
lady
who
protested
to
all
and
singular
that
tadini
had
cured
her
of
amaurosis
at
this
i
laughed
in
his
face
and
told
him
to
leave
me
alone
a
few
days
after
i
found
myself
dining
with
him
at
the
house
of
the
lady
with
the
cataract
she
had
almost
made
up
her
mind
to
submit
to
the
operation
but
as
the
rascal
had
mentioned
my
name
she
wanted
me
to
be
present
at
a
dispute
between
tadini
and
the
other
oculist
who
came
in
with
the
dessert
i
disposed
myself
to
listen
to
the
arguments
of
the
two
rival
professors
with
considerable
pleasure
the
warsaw
oculist
was
a
german
but
spoke
french
very
well
however
he
attacked
tadini
in
latin
the
italian
checked
him
by
saying
that
their
discourse
must
be
conducted
in
a
language
intelligible
to
the
lady
and
i
agreed
with
him
it
was
plain
that
tadini
did
not
know
a
word
of
latin
the
german
oculist
began
by
admitting
that
after
the
operation
for
cataract
there
was
no
chance
of
the
disease
returning
but
that
there
was
a
considerable
risk
of
the
crystalline
humour
evaporating
and
the
patient
being
left
in
a
state
of
total
blindness
tadini
instead
of
denying
this
statement
which
was
inaccurate
had
the
folly
to
take
a
little
box
out
of
his
pocket
it
contained
a
number
of
minute
round
crystals
what
that
said
the
old
professor
a
substance
which
i
can
place
in
the
cornea
to
supply
the
loss
of
the
crystalline
matter
the
german
went
off
into
a
roar
of
laughter
so
long
and
loud
that
the
lady
could
not
help
laughing
i
should
have
liked
to
join
them
but
i
was
ashamed
to
be
thought
the
patron
of
this
ignorant
fellow
so
i
preserved
a
gloomy
silence
tadini
no
doubt
interpreted
my
silence
as
a
mark
of
disapproval
of
the
german
laughter
and
thought
to
better
matters
by
asking
me
to
give
my
opinion
as
you
want
to
hear
it
said
i
here
it
is
there
a
great
difference
between
a
tooth
and
the
crystalline
humour
and
though
you
may
have
succeeded
in
putting
an
artificial
tooth
into
a
gum
this
treatment
will
not
do
with
the
eye
sir
i
am
not
a
dentist
no
nor
an
oculist
either
at
this
the
ignorant
rascal
got
up
and
left
the
room
and
it
was
decidedly
the
best
thing
he
could
do
we
laughed
over
this
new
treatment
and
the
lady
promised
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
the
professor
was
not
content
to
despise
his
opponent
in
silence
he
had
him
cited
before
the
faculty
of
medicine
to
be
examined
on
his
knowledge
of
the
eye
and
procured
the
insertion
of
a
satiric
article
in
the
news
on
the
new
operation
for
replacing
the
crystalline
humour
alluding
to
the
wonderful
artist
then
in
warsaw
who
could
perform
this
operation
as
easily
as
a
dentist
could
put
in
a
false
tooth
this
made
tadini
furious
and
he
set
upon
the
old
professor
in
the
street
and
forced
him
to
the
refuge
in
a
house
after
this
he
no
doubt
left
the
town
on
foot
for
he
was
seen
no
more
now
the
reader
is
in
a
position
to
understand
my
surprise
and
amusement
when
one
day
as
i
peered
through
the
grating
in
my
dungeon
i
saw
the
oculist
tadini
standing
over
me
with
gun
in
hand
but
he
at
all
events
evinced
no
amusement
whatever
while
i
roared
and
roared
again
with
laughter
for
the
two
hours
his
duty
lasted
i
gave
him
a
good
meal
and
a
sufficiency
of
my
excellent
wine
and
at
the
end
a
crown
promising
that
he
should
have
the
same
treatment
every
time
he
returned
to
the
post
but
i
only
saw
him
four
times
as
the
guard
at
my
cell
was
a
position
eagerly
coveted
and
intrigued
for
by
the
other
soldiers
he
amused
me
by
the
story
of
his
misadventures
since
he
had
left
warsaw
he
had
travelled
far
and
wide
without
making
a
fortune
and
at
last
arrived
in
barcelona
where
he
failed
to
meet
with
any
courtesy
or
consideration
he
had
no
introduction
no
diploma
he
had
refused
to
submit
to
an
examination
in
the
latin
tongue
because
as
he
said
there
was
no
connection
between
the
learned
languages
and
the
diseases
of
the
eye
and
the
result
was
that
instead
of
the
common
fate
of
being
ordered
to
leave
the
country
he
was
made
into
a
soldier
he
told
me
in
confidence
that
he
intended
to
desert
but
he
said
he
should
take
care
to
avoid
the
galleys
what
have
you
done
with
your
crystals
i
have
renounced
them
since
i
left
warsaw
though
i
am
sure
they
would
succeed
i
never
heard
of
him
again
on
december
six
weeks
after
my
arrest
the
officer
of
the
guard
came
to
my
cell
and
told
me
to
dress
and
follow
him
where
are
we
going
i
am
about
to
deliver
you
to
an
officer
of
the
viceroy
who
is
waiting
i
dressed
hastily
and
after
placing
all
my
belongings
in
a
portmanteau
i
followed
him
we
went
to
the
guardroom
and
there
i
was
placed
under
the
charge
of
the
officer
who
had
arrested
me
who
took
me
to
the
palace
there
a
government
official
shewed
me
my
trunk
telling
me
that
i
should
find
all
my
papers
intact
and
he
then
returned
me
my
three
passports
with
the
remark
that
they
were
genuine
documents
i
knew
that
all
along
i
suppose
so
but
we
had
reasons
for
doubting
their
authenticity
they
must
have
been
strange
reasons
for
as
you
now
confess
these
reasons
were
devoid
of
reason
you
must
be
aware
that
i
can
not
reply
to
such
an
objection
i
do
ask
you
to
do
so
your
character
is
perfectly
clear
all
the
same
i
must
request
you
to
leave
barcelona
in
three
days
and
catalonia
in
a
week
of
course
i
will
obey
but
it
strikes
me
that
the
catalonian
method
of
repairing
injustice
is
somewhat
peculiar
if
you
think
you
have
ground
for
complaint
you
are
at
liberty
to
go
to
madrid
and
complain
to
the
court
i
have
certainly
grounds
enough
for
complaint
sir
but
i
shall
go
to
france
and
not
to
madrid
i
have
had
enough
of
spanish
justice
will
you
please
give
me
the
order
to
leave
in
writing
that
unnecessary
you
may
take
it
for
granted
my
name
is
emmanuel
badillo
i
am
a
secretary
of
state
that
gentleman
will
escort
you
back
to
the
room
where
you
were
arrested
you
will
find
everything
just
as
you
have
left
it
you
are
a
free
man
i
will
send
you
your
passport
signed
by
the
viceroy
and
myself
good
day
sir
accompanied
by
the
officer
and
a
servant
bearing
my
portmanteau
i
proceeded
to
my
old
inn
on
my
way
i
saw
a
theatrical
poster
and
decided
to
go
to
the
opera
the
good
landlord
was
delighted
to
see
me
again
and
hastened
to
light
me
a
fire
for
a
bitterly
cold
north
wind
was
blowing
he
assured
me
that
no
one
but
himself
had
been
in
my
room
and
in
the
officer
presence
he
gave
me
back
my
sword
my
great
coat
and
to
my
astonishment
the
hat
i
had
dropped
in
my
flight
from
the
assassins
the
officer
asked
me
if
i
had
any
complaints
to
make
and
i
replied
that
i
had
none
i
should
like
to
hear
you
say
that
i
had
done
nothing
but
my
duty
and
that
personally
i
have
not
done
you
any
injury
i
shook
his
hand
and
assured
him
of
my
esteem
farewell
sir
said
he
i
hope
you
will
have
a
pleasant
journey
i
told
my
landlord
that
i
would
dine
at
noon
and
that
i
trusted
to
him
to
celebrate
my
liberation
in
a
fitting
manner
and
then
i
went
to
the
post
office
to
see
if
there
were
any
letters
for
me
i
found
five
or
six
letters
with
the
seals
intact
much
to
my
astonishment
what
is
one
to
make
of
a
government
which
deprives
a
man
of
his
liberty
on
some
trifling
pretext
and
though
seizing
all
his
papers
respects
the
privacy
of
his
letters
but
spain
as
i
have
remarked
is
peculiar
in
every
way
these
letters
were
from
paris
venice
warsaw
and
madrid
and
i
have
never
had
any
reason
to
believe
that
any
other
letters
had
come
for
me
during
my
imprisonment
i
went
back
to
my
inn
and
asked
my
landlord
to
bring
the
bill
you
do
not
owe
me
anything
sir
here
is
your
bill
for
the
period
preceding
your
imprisonment
and
as
you
see
it
has
been
settled
i
also
received
orders
from
the
same
source
to
provide
for
you
during
your
imprisonment
and
as
long
as
you
stayed
at
barcelona
did
you
know
how
long
i
should
remain
in
prison
no
i
was
paid
by
the
week
who
paid
you
you
know
very
well
have
you
had
any
note
for
me
nothing
at
all
what
has
become
of
the
valet
de
place
i
paid
him
and
sent
him
away
immediately
after
your
arrest
i
should
like
to
have
him
with
me
as
far
as
perpignan
you
are
right
and
i
think
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
leave
spain
altogether
for
you
will
find
no
justice
in
it
what
do
they
say
about
my
assassination
why
they
say
you
fired
the
shot
that
people
heard
yourself
and
that
you
made
your
own
sword
bloody
for
no
one
was
found
there
either
dead
or
wounded
that
an
amusing
theory
where
did
my
hat
come
from
it
was
brought
to
me
three
days
after
what
a
confusion
but
was
it
known
that
i
was
imprisoned
in
the
tower
everybody
knew
it
and
two
good
reasons
were
given
the
one
in
public
and
the
other
in
private
what
are
these
reasons
the
public
reason
was
that
you
had
forged
your
passports
the
private
one
which
was
only
whispered
at
the
ear
was
that
you
spent
all
your
nights
with
nina
you
might
have
sworn
that
i
never
slept
out
of
your
inn
i
told
everyone
as
much
but
no
matter
you
did
go
to
her
house
and
for
a
certain
nobleman
that
a
crime
i
am
glad
you
did
not
fly
as
i
advised
you
for
as
it
is
your
character
is
cleared
before
everybody
i
should
like
to
go
to
the
opera
this
evening
take
me
a
box
it
shall
be
done
but
do
not
have
anything
more
to
do
with
nina
i
entreat
you
no
my
good
friend
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
see
her
no
more
just
as
i
was
sitting
down
to
dinner
a
banker
clerk
brought
me
a
letter
which
pleased
me
very
much
it
contained
the
bills
of
exchange
i
had
drawn
in
genoa
in
favour
of
augustin
grimaldi
he
now
sent
them
back
with
these
words
passano
has
been
vainly
endeavouring
to
persuade
me
to
send
these
bills
to
barcelona
so
that
they
may
be
protested
and
you
arrested
i
now
send
them
to
you
to
convince
you
that
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
delight
in
trampling
down
the
victims
of
bad
genoa
november
for
the
fourth
time
a
genoese
had
behaved
most
generously
to
me
i
was
almost
persuaded
that
i
ought
to
forgive
the
infamous
passano
for
the
sake
of
his
four
excellent
but
this
virtue
was
a
little
beyond
me
i
concluded
that
the
best
thing
i
could
do
would
be
to
rid
the
genoese
name
of
the
opprobrium
which
this
rascal
was
always
bringing
on
it
but
i
could
never
find
an
opportunity
some
years
after
i
heard
that
the
wretch
died
in
miserable
poverty
in
genoa
i
was
curious
at
the
time
to
know
what
had
become
of
him
as
it
was
important
for
me
to
be
on
my
guard
i
confided
my
curiosity
to
my
landlord
and
he
instructed
one
of
the
servants
to
make
enquiries
i
only
heard
the
following
circumstance
ascanio
pogomas
or
passano
had
been
released
at
the
end
of
november
and
had
then
been
embarked
on
a
felucca
bound
for
toulon
the
same
day
i
wrote
a
long
and
grateful
letter
to
grimaldi
i
had
indeed
reason
to
be
grateful
for
if
he
had
listened
to
my
enemy
he
might
have
reduced
me
to
a
state
of
dreadful
misery
my
landlord
had
taken
the
box
at
the
opera
in
my
name
and
two
hours
afterwards
to
everyone
great
astonishment
the
posters
announcing
the
plays
of
the
evening
were
covered
by
bills
informing
the
public
that
two
of
the
performers
had
been
taken
ill
that
the
play
would
not
be
given
and
the
theatre
closed
till
the
second
day
of
the
new
year
this
order
undoubtedly
came
from
the
viceroy
and
everybody
knew
the
reason
i
was
sorry
to
have
deprived
the
people
of
barcelona
of
the
only
amusement
they
had
in
the
evening
and
resolved
to
stay
indoors
thinking
that
would
be
the
most
dignified
course
i
could
adopt
petrarch
says
che
fa
gentile
un
cor
villano
if
he
had
known
the
lover
of
nina
he
would
have
changed
the
line
into
che
fa
villan
un
cor
gentile
in
four
months
i
shall
be
able
to
throw
some
more
light
on
this
strange
business
i
should
have
left
barcelona
the
same
day
but
a
slight
tinge
of
superstition
made
me
desire
to
leave
on
the
last
day
of
the
unhappy
year
i
had
spent
in
spain
i
therefore
spent
my
three
days
of
grace
in
writing
letters
to
all
my
friends
don
miguel
de
cevallos
don
diego
de
la
secada
and
the
comte
de
la
peralada
came
to
see
me
but
separately
don
diego
de
la
secada
was
the
uncle
of
the
countess
a
b
whom
i
had
met
at
milan
these
gentlemen
told
me
a
tale
as
strange
as
any
of
the
circumstances
which
had
happened
to
me
at
barcelona
on
the
of
december
the
abbe
marquisio
the
envoy
of
the
duke
of
modena
asked
the
viceroy
before
a
considerable
number
of
people
if
he
could
pay
me
a
visit
to
give
me
a
letter
which
he
could
place
in
no
hands
but
mine
if
not
he
said
he
should
be
obliged
to
take
the
letter
to
madrid
for
which
town
he
was
obliged
to
set
out
the
next
day
the
count
made
no
answer
to
everyone
astonishment
and
the
abbe
left
for
madrid
the
next
day
the
eve
of
my
being
set
at
liberty
i
wrote
to
the
abbe
who
was
unknown
to
me
but
i
never
succeeded
in
finding
out
the
truth
about
this
letter
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
i
had
been
arrested
by
the
despotic
viceroy
who
had
been
persuaded
by
nina
that
i
was
her
favoured
lover
the
question
of
my
passports
must
have
been
a
mere
pretext
for
eight
or
ten
days
would
have
sufficed
to
send
them
to
madrid
and
have
them
back
again
if
their
authenticity
had
been
doubted
possibly
passano
might
have
told
the
viceroy
that
any
passports
of
mine
were
bound
to
be
false
as
i
should
have
had
to
obtain
the
signature
of
my
own
ambassador
this
he
might
have
said
was
out
of
the
question
as
i
was
in
disgrace
with
the
venetian
government
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
mistaken
if
he
really
said
so
but
the
mistake
would
have
been
an
excusable
one
when
i
made
up
my
mind
at
the
end
of
august
to
leave
madrid
i
asked
the
count
of
aranda
for
a
passport
he
replied
that
i
must
first
obtain
one
from
my
ambassador
who
he
added
could
not
refuse
to
do
me
this
service
fortified
with
this
opinion
i
called
at
the
embassy
querini
was
at
san
ildefonso
at
the
time
and
i
told
the
porter
that
i
wanted
to
speak
to
the
secretary
of
embassy
the
servant
sent
in
my
name
and
the
fop
gave
himself
airs
and
pretended
that
he
could
not
receive
me
in
my
indignation
i
wrote
to
him
saying
that
i
had
not
called
to
pay
my
court
to
the
secretary
but
to
demand
a
passport
which
was
my
right
i
gave
my
name
and
my
degree
doctor
of
law
and
begged
him
to
leave
the
passport
with
the
porter
as
i
should
call
for
it
on
the
following
day
i
presented
myself
accordingly
and
the
porter
told
me
that
the
ambassador
had
left
verbal
orders
that
i
was
not
to
have
a
passport
i
wrote
immediately
to
the
marquis
grimaldi
and
to
the
duke
of
lossada
begging
them
to
request
the
ambassador
to
send
me
a
passport
in
the
usual
form
or
else
i
should
publish
the
shameful
reasons
for
which
his
uncle
mocenigo
had
disgraced
me
i
do
not
know
whether
these
gentlemen
shewed
my
letters
to
querini
but
i
do
know
that
the
secretary
oliviera
sent
me
my
passport
thereupon
the
count
aranda
furnished
me
with
a
passport
signed
by
the
king
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
i
left
barcelona
with
a
servant
who
sat
behind
my
chaise
and
i
agreed
with
my
driver
to
take
me
to
perpignan
by
january
the
driver
was
a
piedmontese
and
a
worthy
man
the
next
day
he
came
into
the
room
of
the
wayside
inn
where
i
was
dining
and
in
the
presence
of
my
man
asked
me
whether
i
had
any
suspicion
that
i
was
being
followed
well
i
may
be
i
said
but
what
makes
you
ask
that
question
as
you
were
leaving
barcelona
yesterday
i
noticed
three
fellows
watching
us
armed
to
the
teeth
last
night
they
slept
in
the
stable
with
my
mules
they
dined
here
and
they
went
on
three
quarters
of
an
hour
ago
they
do
speak
to
anyone
and
i
do
like
the
looks
of
them
what
shall
we
do
to
avoid
assassination
or
the
dread
of
it
we
must
start
late
and
stop
at
an
inn
i
know
of
a
league
this
side
of
the
ordinary
stage
where
they
will
be
awaiting
us
if
they
turn
back
and
sleep
at
the
same
inn
as
ourselves
we
shall
be
certain
i
thought
the
idea
a
sensible
one
and
we
started
i
going
on
foot
nearly
the
whole
way
and
at
five
we
halted
at
a
wretched
inn
but
we
saw
no
signs
of
the
sinister
trio
at
eight
i
was
at
supper
when
my
man
came
in
and
told
me
that
the
three
fellows
had
come
back
and
were
drinking
with
our
driver
in
the
stable
my
hair
stood
on
end
there
could
be
no
more
doubt
about
the
matter
at
present
it
was
true
i
had
nothing
to
fear
but
it
would
be
getting
dark
when
we
arrived
at
the
frontier
and
then
my
peril
would
come
i
told
my
servant
to
shew
no
sign
but
to
ask
the
driver
to
come
and
speak
with
me
when
the
assassins
were
asleep
he
came
at
ten
and
told
me
plainly
that
we
should
be
all
murdered
as
we
approached
the
french
frontier
then
you
have
been
drinking
with
them
yes
and
after
we
had
dispatched
a
bottle
at
my
expense
one
of
them
asked
me
why
i
had
not
gone
on
to
the
end
of
the
stage
where
you
would
be
better
lodged
i
replied
that
it
was
late
and
you
were
cold
i
might
have
asked
in
my
turn
why
they
had
not
stayed
at
the
stage
themselves
and
where
they
were
going
but
i
took
care
to
do
nothing
of
the
kind
all
i
asked
was
whether
the
road
to
perpignan
was
a
good
one
and
they
told
me
it
was
excellent
all
the
way
what
are
they
doing
now
they
are
sleeping
by
my
mules
covered
with
their
cloaks
what
shall
we
do
we
will
start
at
after
them
of
course
and
we
shall
dine
at
the
usual
stage
but
after
dinner
trust
me
we
will
take
a
different
road
and
at
midnight
we
shall
be
in
france
safe
and
sound
if
i
could
have
procured
a
good
armed
escort
i
would
not
have
taken
his
advice
but
in
the
situation
i
was
in
i
had
no
choice
we
found
the
three
scoundrels
in
the
place
where
the
driver
had
told
me
we
should
see
them
i
gave
them
a
searching
glance
and
thought
they
looked
like
true
sicarii
ready
to
kill
anyone
for
a
little
money
they
started
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
half
an
hour
later
we
set
out
with
a
peasant
to
guide
us
and
so
struck
into
a
cross
road
the
mules
went
at
a
sharp
pace
and
in
seven
hours
we
had
done
eleven
leagues
at
ten
we
stopped
at
an
inn
in
a
french
village
and
we
had
no
more
to
fear
i
gave
our
guide
a
doubloon
with
which
he
was
well
pleased
and
i
enjoyed
once
more
a
peaceful
night
in
a
french
bed
for
nowhere
will
you
find
such
soft
beds
or
such
delicious
wines
as
in
the
good
land
of
france
the
next
day
i
arrived
at
the
at
perpignan
in
time
for
dinner
i
endeavoured
in
vain
to
think
who
could
have
paid
my
assassins
but
the
reader
will
see
the
explanation
when
we
get
twenty
days
farther
at
perpignan
i
dismissed
my
driver
and
my
servant
rewarding
them
according
to
my
ability
i
wrote
to
my
brother
at
paris
telling
him
i
had
had
a
fortunate
escape
from
the
dagger
of
the
assassin
i
begged
him
to
direct
his
answer
to
aix
where
i
intended
to
spend
a
fortnight
in
the
hope
of
seeing
the
marquis
i
left
perpignan
the
day
after
my
arrival
and
slept
at
narbonne
and
the
day
after
at
beziers
the
distance
from
narbonne
to
beziers
is
only
five
leagues
and
i
had
not
intended
to
stop
but
the
good
cheer
which
the
kindest
of
landladies
gave
me
at
dinner
made
me
stop
with
her
to
supper
beziers
is
a
town
which
looks
pleasant
even
at
the
worst
time
of
the
year
a
philosopher
who
wished
to
renounce
all
the
vanities
of
the
world
and
an
epicurean
who
would
enjoy
good
cheer
cheaply
could
find
no
better
retreat
than
beziers
everybody
at
beziers
is
intelligent
all
the
women
are
pretty
and
the
cooks
are
all
artists
the
wines
are
exquisite
what
more
could
one
desire
may
its
riches
never
prove
its
ruin
when
i
reached
montpellier
i
got
down
at
the
white
horse
with
the
intention
of
spending
a
week
there
in
the
evening
i
supped
at
the
table
where
i
found
a
numerous
company
and
i
saw
to
my
amusement
that
for
every
guest
there
was
a
separate
dish
brought
to
table
nowhere
is
there
better
fare
than
at
montpellier
is
a
veritable
land
of
cocagne
the
next
day
i
breakfasted
at
the
cafe
an
institution
peculiar
to
france
the
only
country
where
the
science
of
living
is
really
understood
and
addressed
the
first
gentleman
i
met
telling
him
that
i
was
a
stranger
and
that
i
would
like
to
know
some
of
the
professors
he
immediately
offered
to
take
me
to
one
of
the
professors
who
enjoyed
a
great
reputation
herein
may
be
seen
another
of
the
good
qualities
of
the
french
who
rank
above
other
nations
by
so
many
titles
to
a
frenchman
a
foreigner
is
a
sacred
being
he
receives
the
best
of
hospitality
not
merely
in
form
but
in
deed
and
his
welcome
is
given
with
that
easy
grace
which
so
soon
sets
a
stranger
at
his
ease
my
new
friend
introduced
me
to
the
professor
who
received
me
with
all
the
polished
courtesy
of
the
french
man
of
letters
he
that
loves
letters
should
love
all
other
lovers
of
letters
and
in
france
that
is
the
case
even
more
so
than
italy
in
germany
the
literary
man
has
an
air
of
mysterious
reserve
he
thinks
he
is
proclaiming
to
all
the
world
that
he
at
all
events
is
a
man
of
no
pretension
whereas
his
pride
peeps
through
every
moment
naturally
the
stranger
is
not
encouraged
by
such
a
manner
as
this
at
the
time
of
my
visit
there
was
an
excellent
company
of
actors
at
montpellier
whom
i
went
to
see
the
same
evening
my
bosom
swelled
at
finding
myself
in
the
blessed
air
of
france
after
all
the
annoyances
i
had
gone
through
in
spain
i
seemed
to
have
become
young
again
but
i
was
altered
for
several
beautiful
and
clever
actresses
appeared
on
the
stage
without
arousing
any
desires
within
me
and
i
would
have
it
so
i
had
a
lively
desire
to
find
madame
castelbajac
not
with
any
wish
to
renew
my
old
relations
with
her
i
wished
to
congratulate
her
on
her
improved
position
but
i
was
afraid
of
compromising
her
by
asking
for
her
in
the
town
i
knew
that
her
husband
was
an
apothecary
so
i
resolved
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
all
the
apothecaries
in
the
place
i
pretended
to
be
in
want
of
some
very
rare
drugs
and
entered
into
conversation
about
the
differences
between
the
trade
in
france
and
in
foreign
countries
if
i
spoke
to
the
master
i
hoped
he
would
talk
to
his
wife
about
the
stranger
who
had
visited
the
countries
where
she
had
been
and
that
that
would
make
her
curious
to
know
me
if
on
the
other
hand
i
spoke
to
the
man
i
knew
he
would
soon
tell
me
all
he
knew
about
his
master
family
on
the
third
day
my
stratagem
succeeded
my
old
friend
wrote
me
a
note
telling
me
that
she
had
seen
me
speaking
to
her
husband
in
his
shop
she
begged
me
to
come
again
at
a
certain
time
and
to
tell
her
husband
that
i
had
known
her
under
the
name
of
mdlle
blasin
in
england
spa
leipzig
and
vienna
as
a
seller
of
lace
she
ended
her
note
with
these
words
i
have
no
doubt
that
my
husband
will
finally
introduce
you
to
me
as
his
wife
i
followed
her
advice
and
the
good
man
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
known
a
young
lace
seller
of
the
name
of
mdlle
blasin
of
montpellier
yes
i
remember
her
well
enough
a
delightful
and
most
respectable
young
woman
but
i
did
not
know
she
came
from
montpellier
she
was
very
pretty
and
very
sensible
and
i
expect
she
did
a
good
business
i
have
seen
her
in
several
european
cities
and
the
last
time
at
vienna
where
i
was
able
to
be
of
some
slight
service
to
her
her
admirable
behaviour
won
her
the
esteem
of
all
the
ladies
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
in
england
i
met
her
at
the
house
of
a
duchess
do
you
think
you
would
recognize
her
if
you
saw
her
again
by
jove
i
should
think
so
but
is
she
at
montpellier
if
so
tell
her
that
the
chevalier
de
seingalt
is
here
sir
you
shall
speak
to
her
yourself
if
you
will
do
me
the
honour
to
follow
me
my
heart
leapt
but
i
restrained
myself
the
worthy
apothecary
went
through
the
shop
climbed
a
stair
and
opening
a
door
on
the
first
floor
said
to
me
there
she
is
what
mademoiselle
you
here
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
this
is
not
a
young
lady
sir
is
my
dear
wife
but
i
hope
that
will
not
hinder
you
from
embracing
her
i
have
never
had
such
an
honour
but
i
will
avail
myself
of
your
permission
with
pleasure
then
you
have
got
married
at
montpellier
i
congratulate
both
of
you
and
wish
you
all
health
and
happiness
tell
me
did
you
have
a
pleasant
journey
from
vienna
to
lyons
madame
blasin
for
so
i
must
continue
to
designate
her
answered
my
question
according
to
her
fancy
and
found
me
as
good
an
actor
as
she
was
an
actress
we
were
very
glad
to
see
each
other
again
but
the
apothecary
was
delighted
at
the
great
respect
with
which
i
treated
his
wife
for
a
whole
hour
we
carried
on
a
conversation
of
a
perfectly
imaginary
character
and
with
all
the
simplicity
of
perfect
truth
she
asked
me
if
i
thought
of
spending
the
carnival
at
montpellier
and
seemed
quite
mortified
when
i
said
that
i
thought
of
going
on
the
next
day
her
husband
hastened
to
say
that
that
was
quite
out
of
the
question
oh
i
hope
you
wo
go
she
added
you
must
do
my
husband
the
honour
of
dining
with
us
after
the
husband
had
pressed
me
for
some
time
i
gave
in
and
accepted
their
invitation
to
dinner
for
the
day
after
next
instead
of
stopping
two
days
i
stopped
four
i
was
much
pleased
with
the
husband
mother
who
was
advanced
in
years
but
extremely
intelligent
she
had
evidently
made
a
point
of
forgetting
everything
unpleasant
in
the
past
history
of
her
son
wife
madame
blasin
told
me
in
private
that
she
was
perfectly
happy
and
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
she
was
speaking
the
truth
she
had
made
a
rule
to
be
most
precise
in
fulfilling
her
wifely
duties
and
rarely
went
out
unless
accompanied
by
her
husband
or
her
i
spent
these
four
days
in
the
enjoyment
of
pure
and
innocent
friendship
without
there
being
the
slightest
desire
on
either
side
to
renew
our
guilty
pleasures
on
the
third
day
after
i
had
dined
with
her
and
her
husband
she
told
me
while
we
were
alone
for
a
moment
that
if
i
wanted
fifty
louis
she
knew
where
to
get
them
for
me
i
told
her
to
keep
them
for
another
time
if
i
was
so
happy
as
to
see
her
again
and
so
unhappy
as
to
be
in
want
i
left
montpellier
feeling
certain
that
my
visit
had
increased
the
esteem
in
which
her
husband
and
her
held
her
and
i
congratulated
myself
on
my
ability
to
be
happy
without
committing
any
sins
the
day
after
i
had
bade
them
farewell
i
slept
at
nimes
where
i
spent
three
days
in
the
company
of
a
naturalist
de
seguier
the
friend
of
the
marquis
maffei
of
verona
in
his
cabinet
of
natural
history
i
saw
and
admired
the
immensity
and
infinity
of
the
creator
handiwork
nimes
is
a
town
well
worthy
of
the
stranger
observation
it
provides
food
for
the
mind
and
the
fair
sex
which
is
really
fair
there
should
give
the
heart
the
food
it
likes
best
i
was
asked
to
a
ball
where
as
a
foreigner
i
took
first
place
a
privilege
peculiar
to
france
for
in
england
and
still
more
in
spain
a
foreigner
means
an
enemy
on
leaving
nimes
i
resolved
to
spend
the
carnival
at
aix
where
the
nobility
is
of
the
most
distinguished
character
i
believe
i
lodged
at
the
three
dolphins
where
i
found
a
spanish
cardinal
on
his
way
to
rome
to
elect
a
successor
to
pope
rezzonico
chapter
ix
my
stay
at
aix
i
fall
ill
i
am
cared
for
by
an
unknown
lady
the
marquis
cagliostro
my
room
was
only
separated
from
his
castilian
eminence
by
a
light
partition
and
i
could
hear
him
quite
plainly
reprimanding
his
chief
servant
for
being
too
economical
my
lord
i
do
my
best
but
it
is
really
impossible
to
spend
more
unless
i
compel
the
to
take
double
the
amount
of
their
bills
and
your
eminence
will
admit
that
nothing
in
the
way
of
rich
and
expensive
dishes
has
been
spared
that
may
be
but
you
ought
to
use
your
wits
a
little
you
might
for
example
order
meals
when
we
shall
not
require
any
take
care
that
there
are
always
three
tables
one
for
us
one
for
my
officers
and
the
third
for
the
servants
why
i
see
that
you
only
give
the
postillions
a
franc
over
the
legal
charge
i
really
blush
for
you
you
must
give
them
a
crown
extra
at
least
when
they
give
you
change
for
a
louis
leave
it
on
the
table
to
put
back
one
change
in
one
pocket
is
an
action
only
worthy
of
a
beggar
they
will
be
saying
at
versailles
and
madrid
and
maybe
at
rome
itself
that
the
cardinal
de
la
cerda
is
a
miser
i
am
no
such
thing
and
i
do
not
want
to
be
thought
one
you
must
really
cease
to
dishonour
me
or
leave
my
service
a
year
before
this
speech
would
have
astonished
me
beyond
measure
but
now
i
was
not
surprised
for
i
had
acquired
some
knowledge
of
spanish
manners
i
might
admire
the
senor
de
la
cerda
prodigality
but
i
could
not
help
deploring
such
ostentation
on
the
part
of
a
prince
of
the
church
about
to
participate
in
such
a
solemn
function
what
i
had
heard
him
say
made
me
curious
to
see
him
and
i
kept
on
the
watch
for
the
moment
of
his
departure
what
a
man
he
was
not
only
ill
made
short
and
but
his
face
was
so
ugly
and
so
low
that
i
concluded
that
aesop
himself
must
have
been
a
little
love
beside
his
eminence
i
understood
now
why
he
was
so
profuse
in
his
generosity
and
decorations
for
otherwise
he
might
well
have
been
taken
for
a
stableboy
if
the
conclave
took
the
eccentric
whim
of
making
him
pope
christ
would
never
have
an
uglier
vicar
i
enquired
about
the
marquis
soon
after
the
departure
of
his
eminence
and
was
told
that
he
was
in
the
country
with
his
brother
the
marquis
president
of
the
parliament
so
i
went
there
this
marquis
famous
for
his
friendship
for
frederick
ii
rather
than
for
his
writings
which
are
no
longer
read
was
an
old
man
when
i
saw
him
he
was
a
worthy
man
fond
of
pleasure
a
epicurean
and
had
married
an
actress
named
cochois
who
had
proved
worthy
of
the
honour
he
had
laid
on
her
he
was
deeply
learned
and
had
a
thorough
knowledge
of
latin
greek
and
hebrew
literature
his
memory
was
prodigious
he
received
me
very
well
and
recalled
what
his
friend
the
marshal
had
written
about
me
he
introduced
me
to
his
wife
and
to
his
brother
a
distinguished
jurist
a
man
of
letters
and
a
strictly
moral
man
by
temperament
as
much
as
religion
though
a
highly
intellectual
man
he
was
deeply
and
sincerely
religious
he
was
very
fond
of
his
brother
and
grieved
for
his
irreligion
but
hoped
that
grace
would
eventually
bring
him
back
to
the
fold
of
the
church
his
brother
encouraged
him
in
his
hopes
while
laughing
at
them
in
private
but
as
they
were
both
sensible
men
they
never
discussed
religion
together
i
was
introduced
to
a
numerous
company
of
both
sexes
chiefly
consisting
of
relations
all
were
amiable
and
highly
polished
like
all
the
provencal
nobility
plays
were
performed
on
the
miniature
stage
good
cheer
prevailed
and
at
intervals
we
walked
in
the
garden
in
spite
of
the
weather
in
province
however
the
winter
is
only
severe
when
the
wind
blows
from
the
north
which
unfortunately
often
happens
among
the
company
were
a
berlin
lady
widow
of
the
marquis
nephew
and
her
brother
this
young
gentleman
who
was
gay
and
free
from
care
enjoyed
all
the
pleasures
of
the
house
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
religious
services
which
were
held
every
day
if
he
thought
on
the
matter
at
all
he
was
a
heretic
and
when
the
jesuit
chaplain
was
saying
mass
he
amused
himself
by
playing
on
the
flute
he
laughed
at
everything
he
was
unlike
his
sister
who
had
not
only
become
a
catholic
but
was
a
very
devout
one
she
was
only
her
brother
told
me
that
her
husband
who
had
died
of
consumption
and
whose
mind
was
perfectly
clear
to
the
last
as
is
usually
the
case
in
phthisis
had
told
her
that
he
could
not
entertain
any
hopes
of
seeing
her
in
the
other
world
unless
she
became
a
catholic
these
words
were
engraved
on
her
heart
she
had
adored
her
husband
and
she
resolved
to
leave
berlin
to
live
with
his
relations
no
one
ventured
to
oppose
this
design
her
brother
accompanying
her
and
she
was
welcomed
joyfully
by
all
her
husband
kinsfolk
this
budding
saint
was
decidedly
plain
her
brother
finding
me
less
strict
than
the
others
soon
constituted
himself
my
friend
he
came
over
to
aix
every
day
and
took
me
to
the
houses
of
all
the
best
people
we
were
at
least
thirty
at
table
every
day
the
dishes
were
delicate
without
undue
profusion
the
conversation
gay
and
animated
without
any
improprieties
i
noticed
that
whenever
the
marquis
chanced
to
let
slip
any
equivocal
expressions
all
the
ladies
made
wry
faces
and
the
chaplain
hastened
to
turn
the
conversation
this
chaplain
had
nothing
jesuitical
in
his
appearance
he
dressed
in
the
costume
of
an
ordinary
priest
and
i
should
never
had
known
him
if
the
marquis
had
not
warned
me
however
i
did
not
allow
his
presence
to
act
as
a
wet
blanket
i
told
in
the
most
decent
manner
possible
the
story
of
the
picture
of
the
virgin
suckling
her
divine
child
and
how
the
spaniards
deserted
the
chapel
after
a
stupid
priest
had
covered
the
beautiful
breast
with
a
kerchief
i
do
not
know
how
it
was
but
all
the
ladies
began
to
laugh
the
disciple
of
loyola
was
so
displeased
at
their
mirth
that
he
took
upon
himself
to
tell
me
that
it
was
unbecoming
to
tell
such
equivocal
stories
in
public
i
thanked
him
by
an
inclination
of
the
head
and
the
marquis
by
way
of
turning
the
conversation
asked
me
what
was
the
italian
for
a
splendid
dish
of
stewed
veal
which
madame
was
helping
una
crostata
i
replied
but
i
really
do
not
know
the
italian
for
the
with
which
it
is
stuffed
these
were
balls
of
rice
veal
champignons
artichoke
foie
gras
etc
the
jesuit
declared
that
in
calling
them
i
was
making
a
mock
of
the
glories
of
hereafter
i
could
not
help
roaring
with
laughter
at
this
and
the
marquis
took
my
part
and
said
that
was
the
proper
french
for
these
balls
after
this
daring
difference
of
opinion
with
his
director
the
worthy
man
thought
it
would
be
best
to
talk
of
something
else
unhappily
however
he
fell
out
of
the
into
the
fire
by
asking
me
my
opinion
as
to
the
election
of
the
next
pope
i
believe
it
will
be
ganganelli
i
replied
as
he
is
the
only
monk
in
the
conclave
why
should
it
be
necessary
to
choose
a
monk
because
none
but
a
monk
would
dare
to
commit
the
excess
which
the
spaniards
will
demand
of
the
new
pope
you
mean
the
suppression
of
the
jesuits
exactly
they
will
never
obtain
such
a
demand
i
hope
not
for
the
jesuits
were
my
masters
and
i
love
them
accordingly
but
all
the
same
ganganelli
will
be
elected
for
an
amusing
and
yet
a
weighty
reason
tell
us
the
reason
he
is
the
only
cardinal
who
does
not
wear
a
wig
and
you
must
consider
that
since
the
foundation
of
the
holy
see
the
pope
has
never
been
bewigged
this
reason
created
a
great
deal
of
amusement
but
the
conversation
was
brought
back
to
the
suppression
of
the
jesuits
and
when
i
told
the
company
that
i
had
heard
from
the
abbe
pinzi
i
saw
the
jesuit
turn
pale
the
pope
could
never
suppress
the
order
he
said
it
seems
that
you
have
never
been
at
a
jesuit
seminary
i
replied
for
the
dogma
of
the
order
is
that
the
pope
can
do
everything
aliquid
pluris
this
answer
made
everybody
suppose
me
to
be
unaware
that
i
was
speaking
to
a
jesuit
and
as
he
gave
me
no
answer
the
topic
was
abandoned
after
dinner
i
was
asked
to
stay
and
see
played
but
i
excused
myself
and
returned
to
aix
with
the
young
berliner
who
told
me
the
story
of
his
sister
and
made
me
acquainted
with
the
character
of
the
society
to
which
the
marquis
was
chiefly
addicted
i
felt
that
i
could
never
adapt
myself
to
their
prejudices
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
young
friend
who
introduced
me
to
some
charming
people
i
should
have
gone
on
to
marseilles
what
with
assemblies
balls
suppers
and
the
society
of
the
handsome
provenqal
ladies
i
managed
to
spend
the
whole
of
the
carnival
and
a
part
of
lent
at
aix
i
had
made
a
present
of
a
copy
of
the
iliad
to
the
learned
marquis
to
his
daughter
who
was
also
a
good
scholar
i
gave
a
latin
tragedy
the
iliad
had
porphyry
comment
it
was
a
copy
of
a
rare
edition
and
was
richly
bound
as
the
marquis
came
to
aix
to
thank
me
i
had
to
pay
another
visit
to
the
country
house
in
the
evening
i
drove
back
in
an
open
carriage
i
had
no
cloak
and
a
cold
north
wind
was
blowing
i
was
perishing
with
cold
but
instead
of
going
to
bed
at
once
i
accompanied
the
berliner
to
the
house
of
a
woman
who
had
a
daughter
of
the
utmost
beauty
though
the
girl
was
only
fourteen
she
had
all
the
indications
of
the
marriageable
age
and
yet
none
of
the
provencal
amateurs
had
succeeded
in
making
her
see
daylight
my
friend
had
already
made
several
unsuccessful
efforts
i
laughed
at
him
as
i
knew
it
was
all
a
cheat
and
i
followed
him
to
the
house
with
the
idea
of
making
the
young
imposter
dismount
from
her
high
horse
as
i
had
done
in
similar
cases
in
england
and
metz
we
set
to
work
and
far
from
resisting
the
girl
said
she
would
be
only
too
glad
to
get
rid
of
the
troublesome
burden
i
saw
that
the
difficulty
only
proceeded
from
the
way
she
held
herself
and
i
ought
to
have
whipped
her
as
i
had
done
in
venice
years
ago
but
i
was
foolish
enough
to
try
to
take
the
citadel
by
storm
but
my
age
of
miracles
was
gone
i
wearied
myself
to
no
purpose
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
then
went
to
my
inn
leaving
the
young
prussian
to
do
his
best
i
went
to
bed
with
a
pain
in
my
side
and
after
six
hours
sleep
awoke
feeling
thoroughly
ill
i
had
pleurisy
my
landlord
called
in
an
old
doctor
who
refused
to
let
me
blood
a
severe
cough
came
on
and
the
next
day
i
began
to
spit
blood
in
six
or
seven
days
the
malady
became
so
serious
that
i
was
confessed
and
received
the
last
sacraments
on
the
tenth
day
the
disease
having
abated
for
three
days
my
clever
old
doctor
answered
for
my
life
but
i
continued
to
spit
blood
till
the
eighteenth
day
my
convalescence
lasted
for
three
weeks
and
i
found
it
more
trying
than
the
actual
illness
for
a
man
in
pain
has
no
time
to
grow
weary
throughout
the
whole
case
i
was
tended
day
and
night
by
a
strange
woman
of
whom
i
knew
nothing
she
nursed
me
with
the
tenderest
care
and
i
awaited
my
recovery
to
give
her
my
sincere
thanks
she
was
not
an
old
woman
neither
was
she
attractive
looking
she
had
slept
in
my
room
all
the
time
after
eastertide
feeling
i
was
well
enough
to
venture
out
i
thanked
her
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
asked
who
had
sent
her
to
me
she
told
me
it
was
the
doctor
and
so
bade
me
farewell
a
few
days
later
i
was
thanking
my
old
doctor
for
having
procured
me
such
a
capital
nurse
but
he
stared
at
me
and
said
he
knew
nothing
about
the
woman
i
was
puzzled
and
asked
my
landlord
if
she
could
throw
any
light
on
the
strange
nurse
identity
but
she
knew
nothing
and
her
ignorance
seemed
universal
i
could
not
discover
whence
or
how
she
came
to
attend
me
after
my
convalescence
i
took
care
to
get
all
the
letters
which
had
been
awaiting
me
and
amongst
them
was
a
letter
from
my
brother
in
paris
in
answer
to
the
epistle
i
wrote
him
from
perpignan
he
acknowledged
my
letter
and
told
me
how
delighted
he
had
been
to
receive
it
after
hearing
the
dreadful
news
that
i
had
been
assassinated
on
the
borders
of
catalonia
at
the
beginning
of
january
the
person
who
gave
me
the
news
my
brother
added
was
one
of
your
best
friends
count
manucci
an
attache
at
the
venetian
embassy
he
said
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
truth
of
the
report
this
letter
was
like
a
flash
of
lightning
to
me
this
friend
of
mine
had
pushed
his
vengeance
so
far
as
to
pay
assassins
to
deprive
me
of
my
life
manucci
had
gone
a
little
too
far
he
must
have
been
pretty
well
qualified
to
prophesy
as
he
was
so
certain
of
my
death
he
might
have
known
that
in
thus
proclaiming
in
advance
the
manner
of
my
death
he
was
also
proclaiming
himself
as
my
murderer
i
met
him
at
rome
two
years
later
and
when
i
would
have
made
him
confess
his
guilt
he
denied
everything
saying
he
had
received
the
news
from
barcelona
however
we
will
speak
of
this
in
its
proper
place
i
dined
and
supped
every
day
at
the
table
and
one
day
i
heard
the
company
talking
of
a
male
and
female
pilgrim
who
had
recently
arrived
they
were
italians
and
were
returning
from
james
of
compostella
they
were
said
to
be
folks
as
they
had
distributed
large
alms
on
their
entry
into
the
town
it
was
said
that
the
female
pilgrim
who
had
gone
to
bed
on
her
arrival
was
charming
they
were
staying
at
the
same
inn
as
i
was
and
we
all
got
very
curious
about
them
as
an
italian
i
put
myself
at
the
head
of
the
band
who
proceeded
to
call
on
the
pilgrims
who
in
my
opinion
must
either
be
fanatics
or
rogues
we
found
the
lady
sitting
in
an
looking
very
tired
she
was
young
beautiful
and
and
in
her
hands
she
held
a
brass
crucifix
some
six
inches
long
she
laid
it
down
when
we
came
in
and
got
up
and
received
us
most
graciously
her
companion
who
was
arranging
on
his
black
mantle
did
not
stir
he
seemed
to
say
by
glancing
at
his
wife
that
we
must
confine
our
attentions
to
her
he
seemed
a
man
of
or
years
of
age
he
was
short
and
badly
hung
and
his
face
bore
all
the
indications
of
daring
impudence
sarcasm
and
imposture
his
wife
on
the
other
hand
was
all
meekness
and
simplicity
and
had
that
modesty
which
adds
so
much
to
the
charm
of
feminine
beauty
they
only
spoke
just
enough
french
to
make
themselves
understood
on
their
journey
and
when
they
heard
me
addressing
them
in
italian
they
seemed
much
relieved
the
lady
told
me
she
was
a
roman
but
i
could
have
guessed
as
much
from
her
accent
i
judged
the
man
to
be
a
neapolitan
or
sicilian
their
passport
dated
rome
called
him
balsamo
while
she
bore
the
names
of
serafina
feliciani
which
she
still
retains
ten
years
later
we
shall
hear
more
of
this
couple
under
the
name
of
cagliostro
we
are
going
back
to
rome
said
she
well
pleased
with
our
devotions
to
james
of
compostella
and
to
our
lady
del
pilar
we
have
walked
the
whole
way
on
foot
living
on
alms
so
as
to
more
surely
win
the
mercy
of
the
god
whom
i
have
offended
so
grievously
we
have
had
silver
and
even
gold
money
given
us
and
in
every
town
we
came
to
we
gave
what
remained
to
the
poor
so
as
not
to
offend
god
by
lack
of
faith
my
husband
is
strong
and
has
not
suffered
much
but
i
have
found
so
much
walking
very
fatiguing
we
have
slept
on
straw
or
bad
beds
always
with
our
clothes
on
to
avoid
contracting
diseases
it
would
be
hard
to
rid
one
self
of
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
last
circumstance
was
added
to
make
us
wish
to
find
out
whether
the
rest
of
her
body
could
compare
with
her
hands
and
arms
in
whiteness
do
you
think
of
making
any
stay
my
weariness
will
oblige
us
to
stay
here
for
three
days
then
we
shall
go
to
rome
by
the
way
of
turin
where
we
shall
pay
our
devotion
to
the
holy
sudary
you
know
of
course
that
there
are
several
of
them
in
europe
so
we
have
heard
but
we
are
assured
that
the
sudary
of
turin
is
the
true
one
it
is
the
kerchief
with
which
veronica
wiped
the
face
of
our
lord
who
left
the
imprint
of
his
divine
face
upon
it
we
left
them
well
pleased
with
the
appearance
and
manners
of
the
lady
pilgrim
but
placing
very
little
trust
in
her
devotion
i
was
still
weak
from
my
illness
and
she
inspired
me
with
no
desires
but
the
rest
would
have
gladly
supped
with
her
if
they
had
thought
there
was
anything
to
follow
next
day
her
husband
asked
me
if
i
would
come
up
and
breakfast
with
them
or
if
they
should
come
down
and
breakfast
with
me
it
would
have
been
impolite
to
have
replied
neither
so
i
said
that
i
should
be
delighted
to
see
them
in
my
room
at
breakfast
i
asked
the
pilgrim
what
he
did
and
he
replied
that
he
was
an
artist
he
could
not
design
a
picture
but
he
could
copy
it
and
he
assured
me
that
he
could
copy
an
engraving
so
exactly
that
none
could
tell
the
copy
from
the
original
i
congratulate
you
if
you
are
not
a
rich
man
you
are
at
least
certain
of
earning
a
living
with
this
talent
everybody
says
the
same
but
it
is
a
mistake
i
have
pursued
this
craft
at
rome
and
at
naples
and
found
i
had
to
work
all
day
to
make
half
a
tester
and
that
not
enough
to
live
on
he
then
shewed
me
some
fans
he
had
done
and
i
thought
them
most
beautiful
they
were
done
in
pen
and
ink
and
the
finest
could
not
have
surpassed
them
next
he
showed
me
a
copy
from
a
rembrandt
which
if
anything
was
finer
than
the
original
in
spite
of
all
he
swore
that
the
work
he
got
barely
supported
him
but
i
did
not
believe
what
he
said
he
was
a
weak
genius
who
preferred
a
vagabond
life
to
methodical
labour
i
offered
a
louis
for
one
of
his
fans
but
he
refused
to
take
it
begging
me
to
accept
the
fan
as
a
gift
and
to
make
a
collection
for
him
at
the
table
as
he
wanted
to
start
the
day
after
next
i
accepted
the
present
and
promised
to
do
as
he
desired
and
succeeded
in
making
up
a
purse
of
two
hundred
francs
for
them
the
woman
had
the
most
virtuous
air
she
was
asked
to
write
her
name
on
a
lottery
ticket
but
refused
saying
that
no
honest
girls
were
taught
to
write
at
rome
everybody
laughed
at
this
excuse
except
myself
and
i
pitied
her
as
i
could
see
that
she
was
of
very
low
origin
next
day
she
came
and
asked
me
to
give
her
a
letter
of
introduction
for
avignon
i
wrote
her
out
two
one
to
audifret
the
banker
and
the
other
to
the
landlady
of
the
inn
in
the
evening
she
returned
me
the
letter
to
the
banker
saying
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
their
purposes
at
the
same
time
she
asked
me
to
examine
the
letter
closely
to
see
if
it
was
really
the
same
document
i
had
given
her
i
did
so
and
said
i
was
sure
it
was
my
letter
she
laughed
and
told
me
i
was
mistaken
as
it
was
only
a
copy
impossible
she
called
her
husband
who
came
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
i
could
doubt
no
longer
and
said
to
him
you
are
a
man
of
talents
for
it
is
much
harder
to
imitate
a
handwriting
than
an
engraving
you
ought
to
make
this
talent
serve
you
in
good
stead
but
be
careful
or
it
may
cost
you
your
life
the
next
day
the
couple
left
aix
in
ten
years
i
saw
them
again
under
the
name
of
count
and
countess
pellegrini
at
the
present
period
he
is
in
a
prison
which
he
will
probably
never
leave
and
his
wife
is
happy
maybe
in
a
convent
chapter
x
my
departure
letter
from
henriette
marsellies
history
of
nina
nice
turin
lugano
madame
as
soon
as
i
had
regained
my
usual
strength
i
went
to
take
leave
of
the
marquis
and
his
brother
i
dined
with
them
pretending
not
to
observe
the
presence
of
the
jesuit
and
i
then
spent
three
delightful
hours
in
conversation
with
the
learned
and
amiable
marquis
he
told
me
a
number
of
interesting
anecdotes
about
the
private
life
of
frederick
ii
no
doubt
the
reader
would
like
to
have
them
but
i
lack
the
energy
to
set
them
down
perhaps
some
other
day
when
the
mists
about
dux
have
dispersed
and
some
rays
of
the
sun
shine
in
upon
me
i
shall
commit
all
these
anecdotes
to
paper
but
now
i
have
not
the
courage
to
do
so
frederick
had
his
good
and
his
bad
qualities
like
all
great
men
but
when
every
deduction
on
the
score
of
his
failings
has
been
made
he
still
remains
the
noblest
figure
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
king
of
sweden
who
has
been
assassinated
loved
to
excite
hatred
that
he
might
have
the
glory
of
defying
it
to
do
its
worst
he
was
a
despot
at
heart
and
he
came
to
a
despot
end
he
might
have
foreseen
a
violent
death
for
throughout
his
life
he
was
always
provoking
men
to
the
point
of
despair
there
can
be
no
comparison
between
him
and
frederick
the
marquis
made
me
a
present
of
all
his
works
and
on
my
asking
him
if
i
could
congratulate
myself
on
possessing
the
whole
number
he
said
yes
with
the
exception
of
a
fragment
of
autobiography
which
he
had
written
in
his
youth
and
which
he
had
afterwards
suppressed
why
so
i
asked
because
i
was
foolish
enough
to
write
the
truth
never
give
way
to
this
temptation
if
it
assails
you
if
you
once
begin
on
this
plan
you
are
not
only
compelled
to
record
all
your
vices
and
follies
but
to
treat
them
in
the
severe
tone
of
a
philosophical
historian
you
must
not
of
course
omit
the
good
you
may
have
done
and
so
praise
and
blame
is
mingled
on
every
page
all
the
evil
you
say
of
yourself
will
be
held
for
gospel
your
peccadilloes
will
be
made
into
crimes
and
your
good
deeds
will
not
only
be
received
with
incredulity
but
you
will
be
taxed
with
pride
and
vanity
for
having
recorded
them
besides
if
you
write
your
memoirs
you
make
an
enemy
in
every
chapter
if
you
once
begin
to
tell
the
truth
a
man
should
neither
talk
of
himself
nor
write
of
himself
unless
it
be
to
refute
some
calumny
or
libel
i
was
convinced
and
promised
never
to
be
guilty
of
such
a
folly
but
in
spite
of
that
i
have
been
writing
memoirs
for
the
last
seven
years
and
though
i
repent
of
having
begun
i
have
sworn
to
go
on
to
the
end
however
i
write
in
the
hope
that
my
memoirs
may
never
see
the
light
of
day
in
the
first
place
the
censure
would
not
allow
them
to
be
printed
and
in
the
second
i
hope
i
shall
be
enough
when
my
last
illness
comes
to
have
all
my
papers
burnt
before
my
eyes
if
that
be
not
the
case
i
count
on
the
indulgence
of
my
readers
who
should
remember
that
i
have
only
written
my
story
to
prevent
my
going
mad
in
the
midst
of
all
the
petty
insults
and
disagreeables
which
i
have
to
bear
day
by
day
from
the
envious
rascals
who
live
with
me
in
this
castle
of
count
waldstein
or
wallenstein
at
dux
i
write
ten
or
twelve
hours
a
day
and
so
keep
black
melancholy
at
bay
my
readers
shall
hear
more
of
my
sufferings
later
on
if
i
do
not
die
before
i
write
them
down
the
day
after
corpus
christi
i
left
aix
for
marseilles
but
here
i
must
set
down
a
circumstance
that
i
had
forgotten
i
mean
the
procession
of
corpus
christi
everyone
knows
that
this
festival
is
celebrated
with
great
ceremony
all
over
christendom
but
at
aix
these
ceremonies
are
of
such
a
nature
that
every
man
of
sense
must
be
shocked
at
my
recital
it
is
well
known
that
this
procession
in
honour
of
the
being
of
beings
represented
under
the
sacramental
forms
is
followed
by
all
the
religious
confraternities
and
this
is
duly
done
at
aix
but
the
scandalous
part
of
the
ceremony
is
the
folly
and
the
buffoonery
which
is
allowed
in
a
rite
which
should
be
designed
to
stir
up
the
hearts
of
men
to
awe
and
reverence
their
creator
instead
of
that
the
devil
death
and
the
seven
deadly
sins
are
impersonated
in
the
procession
they
are
clad
in
the
most
absurd
costumes
and
make
hideous
contortions
beating
and
abusing
each
other
in
their
supposed
vexation
at
having
to
join
in
the
creator
praises
the
people
hoot
and
hiss
them
the
lower
classes
sing
songs
in
derision
of
them
and
play
them
all
manner
of
tricks
and
the
whole
scene
is
one
of
incredible
noise
uproar
and
confusion
more
worthy
of
some
pagan
bacchanalia
than
a
procession
of
christian
people
all
the
from
five
or
six
leagues
around
aix
pour
into
the
town
on
that
day
to
do
honour
to
god
it
is
the
only
occasion
of
the
kind
and
the
clergy
either
knavish
or
ignorant
encourage
all
this
shameful
riot
the
lower
orders
take
it
all
in
good
faith
and
anyone
who
raised
any
objection
would
run
some
risk
for
the
bishop
goes
in
front
of
the
saturnalia
and
consequently
it
is
all
holy
i
expressed
my
disapproval
of
the
whole
affair
as
likely
to
bring
discredit
on
religion
to
a
councillor
of
parliament
de
marc
but
he
told
me
gravely
that
it
was
an
excellent
thing
as
it
brought
no
less
than
a
hundred
thousand
francs
into
the
town
on
the
single
day
i
could
find
no
reply
to
this
very
weighty
reason
every
day
i
spent
at
aix
i
thought
of
henriette
i
knew
her
real
name
and
remembering
the
message
she
had
sent
me
by
marcoline
i
hoped
to
meet
her
in
some
assembly
being
ready
to
adapt
my
conduct
to
hers
i
had
often
heard
her
name
mentioned
but
i
never
allowed
myself
to
ask
any
question
not
wishing
our
old
friendship
to
be
suspected
believing
her
to
be
at
her
country
house
i
had
resolved
on
paying
her
a
visit
and
had
only
stayed
on
at
aix
so
as
to
recover
my
health
before
seeing
her
in
due
course
i
left
aix
with
a
letter
in
my
pocket
for
her
resolving
to
send
it
in
and
to
remain
in
my
carriage
till
she
asked
me
to
get
down
we
arrived
at
her
residence
at
eleven
a
man
came
to
the
door
took
my
letter
and
said
madam
should
have
it
without
fail
then
she
is
not
here
no
sir
she
is
at
aix
since
when
for
the
last
six
months
where
does
she
live
in
her
town
house
she
will
be
coming
here
in
three
weeks
to
spend
the
summer
as
usual
will
you
let
me
write
a
letter
if
you
will
get
down
you
will
find
all
the
necessary
materials
in
madam
room
i
went
into
the
house
and
to
my
extreme
surprise
found
myself
face
to
face
with
my
nurse
you
live
here
then
yes
sir
since
when
for
the
last
ten
years
how
did
you
come
to
nurse
me
if
you
will
step
upstairs
i
will
tell
you
her
story
was
as
follows
madam
sent
for
me
in
haste
and
told
me
to
go
and
attend
to
you
as
if
it
were
herself
she
told
me
to
say
that
the
doctor
had
sent
me
if
you
asked
any
questions
the
doctor
said
he
did
know
you
perhaps
he
was
speaking
the
truth
but
most
likely
he
had
received
orders
from
madam
that
all
i
know
but
i
wonder
you
have
seen
her
at
aix
she
can
not
see
any
company
for
i
have
been
everywhere
she
does
not
see
any
company
at
her
own
house
but
she
goes
everywhere
it
very
strange
i
must
have
seen
her
and
yet
i
do
not
think
i
could
have
passed
her
by
unrecognized
you
have
been
with
her
ten
years
yes
sir
as
i
had
the
honour
of
informing
you
has
she
changed
has
she
had
any
sickness
has
she
aged
not
at
all
she
has
become
rather
stout
but
i
assure
you
you
would
take
her
for
a
woman
of
thirty
i
must
be
blind
or
i
can
not
have
seen
her
i
am
going
to
write
to
her
now
the
woman
went
out
leaving
me
in
astonishment
at
the
extraordinary
situation
in
which
i
was
placed
ought
i
to
return
to
aix
immediately
i
asked
myself
she
has
a
town
house
but
does
not
see
company
but
she
might
surely
see
me
she
loves
me
still
she
cared
for
me
all
through
my
illness
and
she
would
not
have
done
so
if
she
had
become
indifferent
to
me
she
will
be
hurt
at
my
not
recognizing
her
she
must
know
that
i
have
left
aix
and
will
no
doubt
guess
that
i
am
here
now
shall
i
go
to
her
or
shall
i
write
i
resolved
to
write
and
i
told
her
in
my
letter
that
i
should
await
her
reply
at
marseilles
i
gave
the
letter
to
my
late
nurse
with
some
money
to
insure
its
being
dispatched
at
once
and
drove
on
to
marseilles
where
i
alighted
at
an
obscure
inn
not
wishing
to
be
recognized
i
had
scarcely
got
out
of
my
carriage
when
i
saw
madame
schizza
nina
sister
she
had
left
barcelona
with
her
husband
they
had
been
at
marseilles
three
or
four
days
and
were
going
to
leghorn
madame
schizza
was
alone
at
the
moment
her
husband
having
gone
out
and
as
i
was
full
of
curiosity
i
begged
her
to
come
up
to
my
room
while
my
dinner
was
getting
ready
what
is
your
sister
doing
is
she
still
at
barcelona
yes
but
she
will
not
be
there
long
for
the
bishop
will
not
have
her
in
the
town
or
the
diocese
and
the
bishop
is
stronger
than
the
viceroy
she
only
returned
to
barcelona
on
the
plea
that
she
wished
to
pass
through
catalonia
of
her
way
home
but
she
does
not
need
to
stay
there
for
nine
or
ten
months
on
that
account
she
will
have
to
leave
in
a
month
for
certain
but
she
is
not
much
put
out
as
the
viceroy
is
sure
to
keep
her
wherever
she
goes
and
she
may
eventually
succeed
in
ruining
him
in
the
meanwhile
she
is
revelling
in
the
bad
repute
she
has
gained
for
her
lover
i
know
something
of
her
peculiarities
but
she
can
not
dislike
a
man
who
has
made
her
rich
rich
she
has
only
got
her
diamonds
do
you
imagine
this
monster
capable
of
any
feelings
of
gratitude
she
is
not
a
human
being
and
no
one
knows
her
as
i
do
she
has
made
the
count
commit
a
hundred
acts
of
injustice
so
that
all
spain
may
talk
of
her
and
know
that
she
has
made
herself
mistress
of
his
body
and
soul
and
all
he
has
the
worse
his
actions
are
the
more
certain
she
feels
that
people
will
talk
of
her
and
that
is
all
she
wants
her
obligations
to
me
are
beyond
counting
for
she
owes
me
all
even
to
her
existence
and
instead
of
continuing
my
husband
in
her
service
she
has
sent
him
about
his
business
then
i
wonder
how
she
came
to
treat
me
so
generously
if
you
knew
all
you
would
not
feel
grateful
to
her
tell
me
all
then
she
only
paid
for
your
keep
at
the
inn
and
in
prison
to
make
people
believe
you
were
her
lover
and
to
shame
the
count
all
barcelona
knows
that
you
were
assassinated
at
her
door
and
that
you
were
fortunate
enough
to
run
the
fellow
through
but
she
can
not
have
been
the
instigator
of
or
even
the
accomplice
in
the
plot
for
my
assassination
that
against
nature
i
dare
say
but
everything
in
nina
is
against
nature
what
i
tell
you
is
the
bare
truth
for
i
was
a
witness
of
it
all
whenever
the
viceroy
visited
her
she
wearied
him
with
praise
of
your
gallantry
your
wit
your
noble
actions
comparing
you
with
the
spaniards
greatly
to
their
disadvantage
the
count
got
impatient
and
told
her
to
talk
of
something
else
but
she
would
not
and
at
last
he
went
away
cursing
your
name
two
days
before
you
came
to
grief
he
left
her
saying
me
dios
i
will
give
you
a
pleasure
you
do
not
expect
i
assure
you
that
when
we
heard
the
after
you
had
gone
she
remarked
without
evincing
the
slightest
emotion
that
the
shot
was
the
pleasure
her
rascally
spaniard
had
promised
her
i
said
that
you
might
be
killed
the
worse
for
the
count
she
replied
his
turn
will
come
also
then
she
began
laughing
like
a
madcap
she
was
thinking
of
the
excitement
your
death
would
cause
in
barcelona
at
eight
the
following
day
your
man
came
and
told
her
that
you
had
been
taken
to
the
citadel
and
i
will
say
it
to
her
credit
she
seemed
relieved
to
hear
you
were
alive
my
man
i
did
not
know
that
he
was
in
correspondence
with
her
no
i
suppose
not
but
i
assure
you
the
worthy
man
was
very
much
attached
to
you
i
am
sure
he
was
go
on
nina
then
wrote
a
note
to
your
landlord
she
did
not
shew
it
me
but
it
no
doubt
contained
instructions
to
supply
you
with
everything
the
man
told
us
that
he
had
seen
your
sword
all
red
with
blood
and
that
your
cloak
had
a
bullet
hole
through
it
she
was
delighted
but
do
not
think
it
was
because
she
loved
you
she
was
glad
you
had
escaped
that
you
might
take
your
revenge
however
she
was
troubled
by
the
pretext
on
which
the
count
had
had
you
arrested
ricla
did
not
come
to
see
her
that
day
but
he
came
the
next
day
at
eight
and
the
infamous
creature
received
him
with
a
smiling
face
she
told
him
she
had
heard
he
had
imprisoned
you
and
that
she
was
obliged
to
him
as
he
had
of
course
done
so
to
protect
you
from
any
fresh
attempts
on
your
life
he
answered
dryly
that
your
arrest
had
nothing
to
do
with
anything
that
might
have
happened
the
night
before
he
added
that
you
had
only
been
seized
pending
the
examination
of
your
papers
and
that
if
they
were
found
to
be
in
good
form
you
would
be
set
at
liberty
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
nina
asked
him
who
was
the
man
that
you
had
wounded
he
replied
that
the
police
were
enquiring
into
the
matter
but
that
so
far
they
had
neither
found
a
dead
man
nor
a
wounded
man
nor
any
traces
of
blood
all
that
had
been
found
was
casanova
hat
and
this
had
been
returned
to
him
i
left
them
alone
together
till
midnight
so
i
can
not
say
what
further
converse
they
may
have
had
on
the
subject
but
three
or
four
days
later
everybody
knew
that
you
were
imprisoned
in
the
tower
nina
asked
the
count
the
reason
of
this
severity
in
the
evening
and
he
replied
that
your
passports
were
thought
to
be
forgeries
because
you
were
in
disgrace
with
the
state
inquisitors
and
therefore
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
get
a
passport
from
the
venetian
ambassador
on
this
supposition
he
said
you
had
been
placed
in
the
tower
and
if
it
proved
to
be
a
true
one
you
would
be
still
more
severely
punished
this
news
disturbed
us
and
when
we
heard
that
pogomas
had
been
arrested
we
felt
certain
he
had
denounced
you
in
revenge
for
your
having
procured
his
dismissal
from
nina
house
when
we
heard
that
he
had
been
let
out
and
sent
to
genoa
we
expected
to
hear
of
your
being
set
at
liberty
as
the
authorities
must
have
been
satisfied
of
the
genuine
character
of
your
passports
but
you
were
still
shut
up
and
nina
did
not
know
what
to
think
and
the
count
would
not
answer
her
when
she
made
enquiries
about
you
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
say
no
more
about
it
when
at
last
we
heard
you
had
been
set
free
and
that
your
passports
had
been
declared
genuine
nina
thought
to
see
you
in
the
pit
of
the
and
made
preparations
for
a
triumph
in
her
box
but
she
was
in
despair
when
she
heard
no
performance
was
to
be
given
in
the
evening
the
count
told
her
that
your
passports
had
been
returned
with
the
order
to
leave
in
three
days
the
false
creature
praised
her
lover
prudence
to
his
face
but
she
cursed
him
in
her
heart
she
knew
you
would
not
dare
to
see
her
and
when
you
left
without
writing
her
a
note
she
said
you
had
received
secret
orders
not
to
hold
any
further
communications
with
her
she
was
furious
with
the
viceroy
casanova
had
had
the
courage
to
ask
me
to
go
with
him
i
would
have
gone
said
she
your
man
told
her
of
your
fortunate
escape
from
three
assassins
in
the
evening
she
congratulated
ricla
on
the
circumstance
but
he
swore
he
knew
nothing
about
it
nina
did
not
believe
him
you
may
thank
god
from
the
bottom
of
your
heart
that
you
ever
left
spain
alive
after
knowing
nina
she
would
have
cost
you
your
life
at
last
and
she
punishes
me
for
having
given
her
life
what
are
you
her
mother
yes
nina
that
horrible
woman
is
my
daughter
really
everybody
says
you
are
her
sister
that
is
the
horrible
part
of
it
everybody
is
right
explain
yourself
yes
though
it
is
to
my
shame
she
is
my
sister
and
my
daughter
for
she
is
the
daughter
of
my
father
what
your
father
loved
you
i
do
not
know
whether
the
scoundrel
loved
me
but
he
treated
me
as
his
wife
i
was
sixteen
then
she
is
the
daughter
of
the
crime
and
god
knows
she
is
sufficient
punishment
for
it
my
father
died
to
escape
her
vengeance
may
he
also
escape
the
vengeance
of
god
i
should
have
strangled
her
in
her
cradle
but
maybe
i
shall
strangle
her
yet
if
i
do
not
she
will
kill
me
i
remained
dumb
at
the
conclusion
of
this
dreadful
story
which
bore
all
the
marks
of
truth
does
nina
know
that
you
are
her
mother
her
own
father
told
her
the
secret
when
she
was
twelve
after
he
had
initiated
her
into
the
life
she
has
been
living
ever
since
he
would
have
made
her
a
mother
in
her
turn
if
he
had
not
killed
himself
the
same
year
maybe
to
escape
the
gallows
how
did
the
conte
de
ricla
fall
in
love
with
her
it
is
a
short
story
and
a
curious
one
two
years
ago
she
came
to
barcelona
from
portugal
and
was
placed
in
one
of
the
ballets
for
the
sake
of
her
pretty
face
for
as
to
talents
she
had
none
and
could
only
do
the
rebaltade
a
sort
of
skip
and
pirouette
properly
the
first
evening
she
danced
she
was
loudly
applauded
by
the
pit
for
as
she
did
the
rebaltade
she
shewed
her
drawers
up
to
her
waist
in
spain
any
actress
who
shews
her
drawers
on
the
stage
is
liable
to
a
fine
of
a
crown
nina
knew
nothing
about
this
and
hearing
the
applause
treated
the
audience
to
another
skip
of
the
same
kind
but
at
the
end
of
the
ballet
she
was
told
to
pay
two
crowns
for
her
immodesty
nina
cursed
and
swore
but
she
had
to
give
in
what
do
you
think
she
did
to
elude
the
law
and
at
the
same
time
avenge
herself
danced
badly
perhaps
she
danced
without
any
drawers
at
all
and
did
her
rebdltade
as
before
which
caused
such
an
effervescence
of
high
spirits
in
the
house
as
had
never
been
known
at
barcelona
the
conte
de
ricla
had
seen
her
from
his
box
and
was
divided
between
horror
and
admiration
and
sent
for
the
inspector
to
tell
him
that
this
impudent
creature
must
be
punished
the
mean
time
said
he
her
before
me
presently
nina
appeared
in
the
viceroy
box
and
asked
him
impudently
what
he
wanted
with
her
are
an
immodest
woman
and
have
failed
in
your
duty
to
the
public
have
i
done
performed
the
same
skip
as
before
but
i
have
broken
your
law
for
no
one
can
have
seen
my
drawers
as
i
took
the
precaution
not
to
put
any
on
what
more
can
i
do
for
your
cursed
law
which
has
cost
me
two
crowns
already
just
tell
me
the
viceroy
and
the
great
personages
around
him
had
much
ado
to
refrain
from
laughter
for
nina
was
really
in
the
right
and
a
serious
discussion
of
the
violated
law
would
have
been
ridiculous
the
viceroy
felt
he
was
in
a
false
position
and
merely
said
that
if
she
ever
danced
without
drawers
again
she
should
have
a
month
imprisonment
on
bread
and
water
a
week
after
one
of
my
husband
ballets
was
given
it
was
so
well
received
that
the
audience
encored
it
with
enthusiasm
ricla
gave
orders
that
the
public
should
be
satisfied
and
all
the
dancers
were
told
they
would
have
to
reappear
nina
who
was
almost
undressed
told
my
husband
to
do
as
best
he
could
as
she
was
not
going
to
dance
again
as
she
had
the
chief
part
my
husband
could
not
do
without
her
and
sent
the
manager
to
her
she
pushed
the
poor
man
out
with
so
much
violence
that
he
fell
against
the
wall
of
the
passage
head
foremost
the
manager
told
his
piteous
tale
to
the
viceroy
who
ordered
two
soldiers
to
bring
her
before
him
this
was
his
ruin
for
nina
is
a
beautiful
woman
and
in
her
then
state
of
undress
she
would
have
seduced
the
coldest
of
men
the
count
reproved
her
but
his
voice
and
his
manner
were
and
growing
bolder
as
she
watched
his
embarrassment
nina
replied
that
he
might
have
her
torn
to
pieces
if
he
liked
but
she
would
not
dance
against
her
will
and
nowhere
in
her
agreement
was
it
stipulated
that
she
should
dance
twice
in
the
same
evening
whether
for
his
pleasure
or
anyone
else
she
also
expressed
her
anger
at
making
her
appear
before
him
in
a
state
of
and
swore
she
would
never
forgive
his
barbarous
and
despotic
conduct
will
dance
no
more
before
you
or
your
people
let
me
go
away
or
kill
me
if
you
like
do
your
worst
on
me
and
you
shall
find
that
i
am
a
venetian
and
a
free
woman
the
viceroy
sat
astonished
and
said
she
must
be
mad
he
then
summoned
my
husband
and
told
him
she
was
no
longer
in
his
service
nina
was
told
she
was
free
and
could
go
where
she
would
she
went
back
to
her
and
came
to
us
where
she
was
living
the
ballet
went
on
without
her
and
the
poor
viceroy
sat
in
a
dream
for
the
poison
had
entered
into
his
veins
next
day
a
wretched
singer
named
molinari
called
on
nina
and
told
her
that
the
viceroy
was
anxious
to
know
whether
she
were
really
mad
or
not
and
would
like
to
see
her
in
a
country
house
the
name
of
which
he
mentioned
this
was
just
what
the
wretched
woman
wanted
his
highness
she
said
to
molinari
i
will
come
and
that
he
will
find
me
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
and
as
good
as
an
angel
this
is
the
way
in
which
the
connection
began
and
she
fathomed
his
character
so
astutely
that
she
maintained
her
conquest
as
much
with
and
severity
as
with
her
favours
such
was
the
tale
of
the
hapless
madame
schizza
it
was
told
with
all
the
passion
of
an
italian
divided
between
repentance
for
the
past
and
the
desire
of
vengeance
the
next
day
as
i
had
expected
i
received
a
letter
from
henriette
it
ran
as
follows
my
dear
old
friend
nothing
could
be
more
romantic
than
our
meeting
at
my
country
house
six
years
ago
and
now
again
after
a
parting
of
so
many
years
naturally
we
have
both
grown
older
and
though
i
love
you
still
i
am
glad
you
did
not
recognize
me
not
that
i
have
become
ugly
but
i
am
stout
and
this
gives
me
another
look
i
am
a
widow
and
well
enough
off
to
tell
you
that
if
you
lack
money
you
will
find
some
ready
for
you
in
henriette
purse
do
not
come
back
to
aix
to
see
me
as
your
return
might
give
rise
to
gossip
but
if
you
chance
to
come
here
again
after
some
time
we
may
meet
though
not
as
old
acquaintances
i
am
happy
to
think
that
i
have
perhaps
prolonged
your
days
by
giving
you
a
nurse
for
whose
trustworthiness
i
would
answer
if
you
would
like
to
correspond
with
me
i
should
be
happy
to
do
my
part
i
am
very
curious
to
know
what
happened
to
you
after
your
flight
from
the
leads
and
after
the
proofs
you
have
given
me
of
your
discretion
i
think
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
how
we
came
to
meet
at
cesena
and
how
i
returned
to
my
country
the
first
part
is
a
secret
for
everyone
only
is
acquainted
with
a
portion
of
the
story
i
am
grateful
for
the
reticence
you
have
observed
though
marcoline
must
have
delivered
the
message
i
gave
her
tell
me
what
has
become
of
that
beautiful
girl
farewell
i
replied
accepting
her
offer
to
correspond
and
i
told
her
the
whole
story
of
my
adventures
from
her
i
received
forty
letters
in
which
the
history
of
her
life
is
given
if
she
die
before
me
i
shall
add
these
letters
to
my
memoirs
but
at
present
she
is
alive
and
happy
though
advanced
in
years
the
day
after
i
went
to
call
on
madame
audibert
and
we
went
together
to
see
madame
n
n
who
was
already
the
mother
of
three
children
her
husband
adored
her
and
she
was
very
happy
i
gave
her
good
news
of
marcoline
and
told
the
story
of
croce
and
charlotte
death
which
affected
her
to
tears
in
turn
she
told
me
about
rosalie
who
was
quite
a
rich
woman
i
had
no
hopes
of
seeing
her
again
for
she
lived
at
genoa
and
i
should
not
have
cared
to
face
grimaldi
my
niece
as
i
once
called
her
mortified
me
unintentionally
she
said
i
was
ageing
though
a
man
can
easily
make
a
jest
of
his
advancing
years
a
speech
like
this
is
not
pleasant
when
one
has
not
abandoned
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
she
gave
me
a
capital
dinner
and
her
husband
made
me
offers
which
i
was
ashamed
to
accept
i
had
fifty
louis
and
intending
to
go
on
to
turin
i
did
not
feel
uneasy
about
the
future
at
marseilles
i
met
the
duc
de
vilardi
who
was
kept
alive
by
the
art
of
tronchin
this
nobleman
who
was
governor
of
provence
asked
me
to
supper
and
i
was
surprised
to
meet
at
his
house
the
marquis
he
was
engaged
in
holding
the
bank
i
staked
a
few
coins
and
lost
and
the
marquis
asked
me
to
dine
with
him
and
his
wife
an
elderly
englishwoman
who
had
brought
him
a
dowry
of
forty
thousand
guineas
absolutely
with
twenty
thousand
guineas
which
would
ultimately
go
to
her
son
in
london
i
was
not
ashamed
to
borrow
fifty
louis
from
this
lucky
rascal
though
i
felt
almost
certain
that
i
should
never
return
the
money
i
left
marseilles
by
myself
and
after
crossing
the
alps
arrived
at
turin
there
i
had
a
warm
welcome
from
the
chevalier
raiberti
and
the
comte
de
la
perouse
both
of
them
pronounced
me
to
be
looking
older
but
i
consoled
myself
with
the
thought
that
after
all
i
was
only
i
became
an
intimate
friend
of
the
english
ambassador
sir
n
a
rich
accomplished
and
cultured
man
who
kept
the
choicest
of
tables
everybody
loved
him
and
amongst
others
this
feeling
was
warmly
shared
by
a
parmese
girl
named
campioni
who
was
wonderfully
beautiful
as
soon
as
i
had
told
my
friends
that
i
intended
to
go
into
switzerland
to
print
at
my
own
expense
a
refutation
in
italian
of
the
history
of
the
venetian
government
by
amelot
de
la
houssaye
they
all
did
their
best
by
subscribing
and
obtaining
subscriptions
the
most
generous
of
all
was
the
comte
de
la
perouse
who
gave
me
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
for
fifty
copies
i
left
turin
in
a
week
with
two
thousand
lire
in
my
purse
with
this
i
should
be
able
to
print
the
book
i
had
composed
in
my
prison
but
i
should
have
to
rewrite
it
initio
with
the
volume
to
my
hand
as
also
the
history
of
venice
by
nani
when
i
had
got
these
works
i
set
out
with
the
intention
of
having
my
book
printed
at
lugano
as
there
was
a
good
press
there
and
no
censure
i
also
knew
that
the
head
of
the
press
was
a
man
and
that
the
place
abounded
in
good
cheer
and
good
society
lugano
is
near
milan
como
and
lake
maggiore
and
i
was
well
pleased
with
the
situation
i
went
to
the
best
inn
which
was
kept
by
a
man
named
tagoretti
who
gave
me
the
best
room
in
the
house
the
day
after
my
arrival
i
called
on
agnelli
who
was
at
once
printer
priest
theologian
and
an
honest
man
i
made
a
regular
agreement
with
him
he
engaging
to
print
at
the
rate
of
four
sheets
a
week
and
on
my
side
i
promised
to
pay
him
every
week
he
reserved
the
right
of
censorship
expressing
a
hope
that
our
opinions
might
coincide
i
gave
him
the
preface
and
the
preliminary
matter
at
once
and
chose
the
paper
and
the
size
large
octavo
when
i
got
back
to
my
inn
the
landlord
told
me
that
the
bargello
or
chief
constable
wanted
to
see
me
although
lugano
is
in
switzerland
its
municipal
government
is
modelled
after
that
of
the
italian
towns
i
was
curious
to
hear
what
this
personage
could
have
to
say
to
me
so
i
told
him
to
shew
him
in
after
giving
me
a
profound
bow
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
signor
bargello
told
me
that
he
had
come
to
offer
me
his
services
and
to
assure
me
that
i
should
enjoy
complete
tranquillity
and
safety
in
lugano
whether
from
any
enemies
within
the
state
or
from
the
venetian
government
in
case
i
had
any
dispute
with
it
i
thank
you
signor
i
replied
and
i
am
sure
that
you
are
telling
me
the
truth
as
i
am
in
switzerland
i
must
take
the
liberty
of
telling
you
sir
that
it
is
customary
for
strangers
who
take
up
their
residence
in
lugano
to
pay
some
trifling
sum
either
by
the
week
the
month
or
the
year
and
if
they
refuse
to
pay
then
their
safety
is
not
so
sure
money
does
everything
in
lugano
i
suppose
but
sir
i
understand
but
let
me
tell
you
that
i
have
no
fears
and
i
shall
consequently
beg
to
be
excused
from
paying
anything
you
will
forgive
me
but
i
happen
to
know
that
you
have
some
disputes
with
the
venetian
government
you
are
making
a
mistake
my
good
fellow
no
i
am
not
if
you
are
so
sure
find
someone
to
bet
me
two
hundred
sequins
that
i
have
reason
to
fear
the
venetian
government
i
will
take
the
bet
and
deposit
the
amount
the
bargello
remained
silent
and
the
landlord
told
him
he
seemed
to
have
made
some
kind
of
mistake
so
he
went
away
looking
very
disappointed
my
landlord
was
delighted
to
hear
that
i
thought
of
making
some
stay
at
lugano
and
advised
me
to
call
on
the
high
bailiff
who
governed
the
place
he
a
very
nice
swiss
gentleman
said
he
and
his
wife
a
clever
woman
and
as
fair
as
the
day
i
will
go
and
see
him
i
sent
in
my
name
to
the
high
bailiff
at
noon
on
the
day
following
and
what
was
my
surprise
to
find
myself
in
the
presence
of
de
r
and
his
charming
wife
beside
her
was
a
pretty
boy
five
or
six
years
old
our
mutual
surprise
may
be
imagined

these

we
all
remained
for
some
time

with

first
to
break
the
silence
by
giving
me
a
cordial

we
burst

into

for
having
imagined
that
there

for
not

made

with
him

we
seemed
as
if
we
had
never
parted
the
republic
had
given
him
this
employ
a
very
lucrative
one
and
he
was
only
sorry
that
it
would
expire
in
two
years
he
told
me
he
was
delighted
to
be
able
to
be
of
use
to
me

begged
me
to
consider
he
was
wholly
at
my
service

was
delighted
to
hear
that
i
should
be
engaged
in
seeing
my
work
through
the
press
for
three
or
four
months
and
seemed
vexed
when
i
told
him
that
i
could
not
accept
his
hospitality
more
than
once
a
week
as
my
labours
would
be
incessant
madame
de
r
could
scarcely
recover
from
her
surprise
it
was
nine
years
since
i
had
seen
her
at
soleure
and
then
i
thought
her
beauty
must
be
at
its
zenith
but
i
was
wrong
she
was
still
more
beautiful
and
i
told
her
so
she
shewed
me
her
only
child
who
had
been
born
four
years
after
my
departure
she
cherished
the
child
as
the
apple
of
her
eye
and
seemed
likely
to
spoil
it
but
i
heard
a
few
years
ago
that
this
child
is
now
an
amiable
and
accomplished
man
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
madame
de
r
informed
me
of
all
that
had
happened
at
soleure
since
my
departure
lebel
had
gone
to
besancon
where
he
lived
happily
with
his
charming
wife
she
happened
to
observe
in
a
casual
way
that
i
no
longer
looked
as
young
as
i
had
done
at
soleure
and
this
made
me
regulate
my
conduct
in
a
manner
i
might
not
otherwise
have
done
i
did
not
let
her
beauty
carry
me
away
i
resisted
the
effect
of
her
charms
and
i
was
content
to
enjoy
her
friendship
and
to
be
worthy
of
the
friendship
of
her
good
husband
the
work
on
which
i
was
engaged
demanded
all
my
care
and
attention
and
a
love
affair
would
have
wasted
most
of
my
time
i
began
work
the
next
morning
and
save
for
an
hour
visit
from
de
r
i
wrote
on
till
nightfall
the
next
day
i
had
the
first
with
which
i
was
well
enough
pleased
i
spent
the
whole
of
the
next
month
in
my
room
working
assiduously
and
only
going
out
to
mass
on
feast
days
to
dine
with
de
r
and
to
walk
with
his
wife
and
her
child
at
the
end
of
a
month
my
first
volume
was
printed
and
stitched
and
the
manuscript
of
the
second
volume
was
ready
for
the
press
towards
the
end
of
october
the
printer
sent
in
the
entire
work
in
three
volumes
and
in
less
than
a
year
the
edition
was
sold
out
my
object
was
not
so
much
to
make
money
as
to
appease
the
wrath
of
the
venetian
inquisitors
i
had
gone
all
over
europe
and
experienced
a
violent
desire
to
see
my
native
land
once
more
amelot
de
la
houssaye
had
written
his
book
from
the
point
of
view
of
an
enemy
of
venice
his
history
was
rather
a
satire
containing
learned
and
slanderous
observations
mingled
together
it
had
been
published
for
seventy
years
but
hitherto
no
one
had
taken
the
trouble
to
refute
it
if
a
venetian
had
attempted
to
do
so
he
would
not
have
obtained
permission
from
his
government
to
print
it
in
the
states
of
venice
for
the
state
policy
is
to
allow
no
one
to
discuss
the
actions
of
the
authorities
whether
in
praise
or
blame
consequently
no
writer
had
attempted
to
refute
the
french
history
as
it
was
well
known
that
the
refutation
would
be
visited
with
punishment
and
not
with
reward
my
position
was
an
exceptional
one
i
had
been
persecuted
by
the
venetian
government
so
no
one
could
accuse
me
of
being
partial
and
by
my
exposing
the
calumnies
of
amelot
before
all
europe
i
hoped
to
gain
a
reward
which
after
all
would
only
be
an
act
of
justice
i
had
been
an
exile
for
fourteen
years
and
i
thought
the
inquisitors
would
be
glad
to
repair
their
injustice
on
the
pretext
of
rewarding
my
patriotism
my
readers
will
see
that
my
hopes
were
fulfilled
but
i
had
to
wait
for
five
more
years
instead
of
receiving
permission
to
return
at
once
de
bragadin
was
dead
and
dandolo
and
barbaro
were
the
only
friends
i
had
left
at
venice
and
with
their
aid
i
contrived
to
subscribe
fifty
copies
of
my
book
in
my
native
town
throughout
my
stay
at
lugano
i
only
frequented
the
house
of
de
r
where
i
saw
the
abbe
riva
a
learned
and
discreet
man
to
whom
i
had
been
commended
by
querini
his
relation
the
abbe
enjoyed
such
a
reputation
for
wisdom
amongst
his
that
he
was
a
kind
of
arbiter
in
all
disputes
and
thus
the
expenses
of
the
law
were
saved
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
gentlemen
of
the
long
robe
hated
him
most
cordially
his
nephew
jean
baptiste
riva
was
a
friend
of
the
muses
of
bacchus
and
of
venus
he
was
also
a
friend
of
mine
though
i
could
not
match
him
with
the
bottles
he
lent
me
all
the
nymphs
he
had
initiated
into
the
mysteries
and
they
liked
him
all
the
better
as
i
made
them
some
small
presents
with
him
and
his
two
pretty
sisters
i
went
to
the
borromean
isles
i
knew
that
count
borromeo
who
had
honoured
me
with
his
friendship
at
turin
was
there
and
from
him
i
felt
certain
of
a
warm
welcome
one
of
the
two
sisters
had
to
pass
for
riva
wife
and
the
other
for
his
although
the
count
was
a
ruined
man
he
lived
in
his
isles
like
a
prince
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
these
islands
of
the
blest
they
must
be
seen
to
be
imagined
the
inhabitants
enjoy
an
everlasting
spring
there
is
neither
heat
nor
cold
the
count
regaled
us
choicely
and
amused
the
two
girls
by
giving
them
rods
and
lines
and
letting
them
fish
although
he
was
ugly
old
and
ruined
he
still
possessed
the
art
of
pleasing
on
the
way
back
to
lugano
as
i
was
making
place
for
a
carriage
in
a
narrow
road
my
horse
slipped
and
fell
down
a
slope
ten
feet
high
my
head
went
against
a
large
stone
and
i
thought
my
last
hour
was
come
as
the
blood
poured
out
of
the
wound
however
i
was
well
again
in
a
few
days
this
was
my
last
ride
on
horseback
during
my
stay
at
lugano
the
inspectors
of
the
swiss
cantons
came
there
in
its
turn
the
people
dignified
them
with
the
magnificent
title
of
ambassadors
but
de
r
was
content
to
call
them
avoyers
these
gentlemen
stayed
at
my
inn
and
i
had
my
meals
with
them
throughout
their
stay
the
avoyer
of
berne
gave
me
some
news
of
my
poor
friend
f
his
charming
daughter
sara
had
become
the
wife
of
m
de
v
and
was
happy
a
few
days
after
these
pleasant
and
cultured
men
had
left
i
was
startled
one
morning
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
wretched
marazzani
in
my
room
i
seized
him
by
his
collar
threw
him
out
and
before
he
had
time
to
use
his
cane
or
his
sword
i
had
kicked
beaten
and
boxed
him
most
soundly
he
defended
himself
to
the
best
of
his
ability
and
the
landlord
and
his
men
ran
up
at
the
noise
and
had
some
difficulty
in
separating
us
do
let
him
go
i
cried
send
for
the
bargello
and
have
him
away
to
prison
i
dressed
myself
hastily
and
as
i
was
going
out
to
see
de
r
the
bargello
met
me
and
asked
me
on
what
charge
i
gave
the
man
into
custody
you
will
hear
that
at
de
r
where
i
shall
await
you
i
must
now
explain
my
anger
you
may
remember
reader
that
i
left
the
wretched
fellow
in
the
prison
of
buen
retiro
i
heard
afterwards
that
the
king
of
spain
jerusalem
and
the
canary
islands
had
given
him
a
small
post
in
a
galley
off
the
coast
of
africa
he
had
done
me
no
harm
and
i
pitied
him
but
not
being
his
intimate
friend
and
having
no
power
to
mitigate
the
hardship
of
his
lot
i
had
forgotten
him
eight
months
after
i
met
at
barcelona
madame
bellucci
a
venetian
dancer
with
whom
i
had
had
a
small
intrigue
she
gave
an
exclamation
of
delight
on
seeing
me
and
said
she
was
glad
to
see
me
delivered
from
the
hard
fate
to
which
a
tyrannous
government
had
condemned
me
what
fate
is
that
i
asked
i
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
misfortune
since
i
left
you
i
mean
the
presidio
but
that
has
never
been
my
lot
thank
god
who
told
you
such
a
story
a
count
marazzani
who
was
here
three
weeks
ago
and
told
me
he
had
been
luckier
than
you
as
he
had
made
his
escape
he
a
liar
and
a
scoundrel
and
if
ever
i
meet
him
again
he
shall
pay
me
dearly
from
that
moment
i
never
thought
of
the
rascal
without
feeling
a
lively
desire
to
give
him
a
thrashing
but
i
never
thought
that
chance
would
bring
about
so
early
a
meeting
under
the
circumstances
i
think
my
behaviour
will
be
thought
only
natural
i
had
beaten
him
but
that
was
not
enough
for
me
i
seemed
to
have
done
nothing
and
indeed
i
had
got
as
good
as
i
gave
in
the
mean
time
he
was
in
prison
and
i
went
to
de
r
to
see
what
he
could
do
for
me
as
soon
as
de
r
heard
my
statement
he
said
he
could
neither
keep
him
in
prison
nor
drive
him
out
of
the
town
unless
i
laid
a
plea
before
him
craving
protection
against
this
man
whom
i
believed
to
have
come
to
lugano
with
the
purpose
of
assassinating
me
you
can
make
the
document
more
effective
he
added
by
placing
your
actual
grievance
in
a
strong
light
and
laying
stress
on
his
sudden
appearance
in
your
room
without
sending
in
his
name
that
what
you
had
better
do
and
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
i
shall
answer
your
plea
i
shall
ask
him
for
his
passport
and
delay
the
case
and
order
him
to
be
severely
treated
but
in
the
end
i
shall
only
be
able
to
drive
him
out
of
the
town
unless
he
can
find
good
bail
i
could
ask
no
more
i
sent
in
my
plea
and
the
next
day
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
brought
into
the
court
bound
hand
and
foot
de
r
began
to
examine
him
and
marazzani
swore
he
had
no
evil
intentions
in
calling
on
me
as
to
the
calumny
he
protested
he
had
only
repeated
common
rumour
and
professed
his
joy
at
finding
it
had
been
mistaken
this
ought
to
have
been
enough
for
me
but
i
continued
obdurate
de
r
said
the
fact
of
my
being
sent
to
the
galleys
having
been
rumoured
was
no
justification
for
his
repeating
it
and
furthermore
he
proceeded
casanova
suspicion
that
you
were
going
to
assassinate
him
is
justified
by
your
giving
a
false
name
for
the
plaintiff
maintains
that
you
are
not
count
marazzani
at
all
he
offers
to
furnish
surety
on
this
behalf
and
if
casanova
does
you
wrong
his
bail
will
escheat
to
you
as
damages
in
the
mean
time
you
will
remain
in
prison
till
we
have
further
information
about
your
real
status
he
was
taken
back
and
as
the
poor
devil
had
not
a
penny
in
his
pocket
it
would
have
been
superfluous
to
tell
the
bargedlo
to
treat
him
severely
de
r
wrote
to
the
swiss
agent
at
parma
to
obtain
the
necessary
information
but
as
the
rascal
knew
this
would
be
against
him
he
wrote
me
a
humble
letter
in
which
he
confessed
that
he
was
the
son
of
a
poor
shopkeeper
of
bobbio
and
although
his
name
was
really
marazzani
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
marazzanis
of
plaisance
he
begged
me
to
set
him
at
liberty
i
shewed
the
letter
to
de
r
who
let
him
out
of
prison
with
orders
to
leave
lugano
in
hours
i
thought
i
had
been
rather
too
harsh
with
him
and
gave
the
poor
devil
some
money
to
take
him
to
augsburg
and
also
a
letter
for
de
sellentin
who
was
recruiting
there
for
the
prussian
king
we
shall
hear
of
marazzani
again
the
chevalier
de
breche
came
to
the
lugano
fair
to
buy
some
horses
and
stopped
a
fortnight
i
often
met
him
at
de
r
for
whose
wife
he
had
a
great
admiration
and
i
was
sorry
to
see
him
go
i
left
lugano
myself
a
few
days
later
having
made
up
my
mind
to
winter
in
turin
where
i
hoped
to
see
some
pleasant
society
before
i
left
i
received
a
friendly
letter
from
prince
lubomirski
with
a
bill
for
a
hundred
ducats
in
payment
of
fifty
copies
of
my
book
the
prince
had
become
lord
high
marshal
on
the
death
of
count
bilinski
when
i
got
to
turin
i
found
a
letter
from
the
noble
venetian
girolamo
zulian
the
same
that
had
given
me
an
introduction
to
mocenigo
his
letter
contained
an
enclosure
to
berlendis
the
representative
of
the
republic
at
turin
who
thanked
me
for
having
enabled
him
to
receive
me
the
ambassador
a
rich
man
and
a
great
lover
of
the
fair
sex
kept
up
a
splendid
establishment
and
this
was
enough
for
his
government
for
intelligence
is
not
considered
a
necessary
qualification
for
a
venetian
ambassador
indeed
it
is
a
positive
disadvantage
and
a
witty
ambassador
would
no
doubt
fall
into
disgrace
with
the
venetian
senate
however
berlendis
ran
no
risk
whatever
on
this
score
the
realm
of
wit
was
an
unknown
land
to
him
i
got
this
ambassador
to
call
the
attention
of
his
government
to
the
work
i
had
recently
published
and
the
answer
the
state
inquisitors
gave
may
astonish
my
readers
but
it
did
not
astonish
me
the
secretary
of
the
famous
and
accursed
tribunal
wrote
to
say
that
he
had
done
well
to
call
the
attention
of
the
inquisitors
to
this
work
as
the
presumption
appeared
on
the
he
added
that
the
work
would
be
examined
and
in
the
mean
time
the
ambassador
was
instructed
to
shew
me
no
signal
marks
of
favour
lest
the
court
should
suppose
he
was
protecting
me
as
a
venetian
nevertheless
it
was
the
same
tribunal
that
had
facilitated
my
access
to
the
ambassador
to
madrid
mocenigo
i
told
berlendis
that
my
visits
should
be
limited
in
number
and
free
from
all
ostentation
i
was
much
interested
in
his
son
tutor
he
was
a
priest
a
man
of
letters
and
a
poet
his
name
was
andreis
and
he
is
now
resident
in
england
where
he
enjoys
full
liberty
the
greatest
of
all
blessings
i
spent
my
time
at
turin
very
pleasantly
in
the
midst
of
a
small
circle
of
epicureans
there
were
the
old
chevalier
raiberti
the
comte
de
la
perouse
a
certain
abbe
roubien
a
delightful
man
the
voluptuous
comte
de
riva
and
the
english
ambassador
to
the
amusements
which
this
society
afforded
i
added
a
course
of
reading
but
no
love
affairs
whatever
while
i
was
at
turin
a
milliner
perouse
mistress
feeling
herself
in
mortis
swallowed
the
portrait
of
her
lover
instead
of
the
eucharist
this
incident
made
me
compose
two
sonnets
which
pleased
me
a
good
deal
at
the
time
and
with
which
i
am
still
satisfied
no
doubt
some
will
say
that
every
poet
is
pleased
with
his
own
handiwork
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
severest
critic
of
a
sensible
author
is
himself
the
russian
squadron
under
the
command
of
count
alexis
orloff
was
then
at
leghorn
this
squadron
threatened
constantinople
and
would
probably
have
taken
it
if
an
englishman
had
been
in
command
as
i
had
known
count
orloff
in
russia
i
imagined
that
i
might
possibly
render
myself
of
service
to
him
and
at
the
same
time
make
my
fortune
the
english
ambassador
having
given
me
a
letter
for
the
english
consul
i
left
turin
with
very
little
money
in
my
purse
and
no
letter
of
credit
on
any
banker
an
englishman
named
acton
commended
me
to
an
english
banker
at
leghorn
but
this
letter
did
not
empower
me
to
draw
any
supplies
acton
was
just
then
involved
in
a
curious
complication
when
he
was
at
venice
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
pretty
woman
either
a
greek
or
a
neapolitan
the
husband
by
birth
a
native
of
turin
and
by
profession
a
placed
no
obstacle
in
acton
way
as
the
englishman
was
generous
with
his
money
but
he
had
a
knack
of
turning
up
at
those
moments
when
his
absence
would
have
been
most
desirable
the
generous
but
proud
and
impatient
englishman
could
not
be
expected
to
bear
this
for
long
he
consulted
with
the
lady
and
determined
to
shew
his
teeth
the
husband
persisted
in
his
untimely
visits
and
one
day
acton
said
dryly
do
you
want
a
thousand
guineas
you
can
have
them
if
you
like
on
the
condition
that
your
wife
travels
with
me
for
three
years
without
our
having
the
pleasure
of
your
society
the
husband
thought
the
bargain
a
good
one
and
signed
an
agreement
to
that
effect
after
the
three
years
were
over
the
husband
wrote
to
his
wife
who
was
at
venice
to
return
to
him
and
to
acton
to
put
no
obstacle
in
the
way
the
lady
replied
that
she
did
not
want
to
live
with
him
any
more
and
acton
explained
to
the
husband
that
he
could
not
be
expected
to
drive
his
mistress
away
against
her
will
he
foresaw
however
that
the
husband
would
complain
to
the
english
ambassador
and
determined
to
be
with
him
in
due
course
the
husband
did
apply
to
the
english
ambassador
requesting
him
to
compel
acton
to
restore
to
him
his
lawful
wife
he
even
asked
the
chevalier
raiberti
to
write
to
the
commendatore
camarana
the
sardinian
ambassador
at
venice
to
apply
pressure
on
the
venetian
government
and
he
would
doubtless
have
succeeded
if
raiberti
had
done
him
this
favour
however
as
it
was
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
and
even
gave
acton
a
warm
welcome
when
he
came
to
turin
to
look
into
the
matter
he
had
left
his
mistress
at
venice
under
the
protection
of
the
english
consul
the
husband
was
ashamed
to
complain
publicly
as
he
would
have
been
confronted
with
the
disgraceful
agreement
he
had
signed
but
berlendis
maintained
that
he
was
in
the
right
and
argued
the
question
in
the
most
amusing
manner
on
the
one
hand
he
urged
the
sacred
and
inviolable
character
of
the
marriage
rite
and
on
the
other
he
shewed
how
the
wife
was
bound
to
submit
to
her
husband
in
all
things
i
argued
the
matter
with
him
myself
shewing
him
his
disgraceful
position
in
defending
a
man
who
traded
on
his
wife
charms
and
he
was
obliged
to
give
in
when
i
assured
him
that
the
husband
had
offered
to
renew
the
lease
for
the
same
time
and
on
the
same
terms
as
before
two
years
later
i
met
acton
at
bologna
and
admired
the
beauty
whom
he
considered
and
treated
as
his
wife
she
held
on
her
knees
a
fine
little
acton
i
left
turin
for
parma
with
a
venetian
who
like
myself
was
an
exile
from
his
country
he
had
turned
actor
to
gain
a
livelihood
and
was
going
to
parma
with
two
actresses
one
of
whom
was
interesting
as
soon
as
i
found
out
who
he
was
we
became
friends
and
he
would
have
gladly
made
me
a
partner
in
all
his
amusements
by
the
way
if
i
had
been
in
the
humour
to
join
him
this
journey
to
leghorn
was
undertaken
under
the
influence
of
chimerical
ideas
i
thought
i
might
be
useful
to
count
orloff
in
the
conquest
he
was
going
to
make
as
it
was
said
of
constantinople
i
fancied
that
it
had
been
decreed
by
fate
that
without
me
he
could
never
pass
through
the
dardanelles
in
spite
of
the
wild
ideas
with
which
my
mind
was
occupied
i
conceived
a
warm
friendship
for
my
travelling
companion
whose
name
was
angelo
bentivoglio
the
government
never
forgave
him
a
certain
crime
which
to
the
philosophic
eye
appears
a
mere
trifle
in
four
years
later
when
i
describe
my
stay
at
venice
i
shall
give
some
further
account
of
him
about
noon
we
reached
parma
and
i
bade
adieu
to
bentivoglio
and
his
friends
the
court
was
at
colorno
but
having
nothing
to
gain
from
this
mockery
of
a
court
and
wishing
to
leave
for
bologna
the
next
morning
i
asked
chief
of
the
mint
and
a
talented
though
vain
man
to
give
me
some
dinner
the
reader
will
remember
that
i
had
known
him
twenty
two
years
before
when
i
was
in
love
with
henriette
he
was
delighted
to
see
me
and
seemed
to
set
great
store
by
my
politeness
in
giving
him
the
benefit
of
my
short
stay
at
parma
i
told
him
that
count
orloff
was
waiting
for
me
at
leghorn
and
that
i
was
obliged
to
travel
day
and
night
he
will
be
setting
sail
before
long
said
he
i
have
advices
from
leghorn
to
that
effect
i
said
in
a
mysterious
tone
of
voice
that
he
would
not
sail
without
me
and
i
could
see
that
my
host
treated
me
with
increased
respect
after
this
he
wanted
to
discuss
the
russian
expedition
but
my
air
of
reserve
made
him
change
the
conversation
at
dinner
we
talked
a
good
deal
about
henriette
whom
he
said
he
had
succeeded
in
finding
out
but
though
he
spoke
of
her
with
great
respect
i
took
care
not
to
give
him
any
information
on
the
subject
he
spent
the
whole
afternoon
in
uttering
complaints
against
the
sovereigns
of
europe
the
king
of
prussia
excepted
as
he
had
made
him
a
baron
though
i
never
could
make
out
why
he
cursed
the
duke
of
parma
who
persisted
in
retaining
his
services
although
there
was
no
mint
in
existence
in
the
duchy
and
his
talents
were
consequently
wasted
there
i
listened
to
all
his
complaints
and
agreed
that
louis
xv
had
been
ungrateful
in
not
conferring
the
order
of
michael
on
him
that
venice
had
rewarded
his
services
very
shabbily
that
spain
was
stingy
and
naples
devoid
of
honesty
etc
when
he
had
finished
i
asked
him
if
he
could
give
me
a
bill
on
a
banker
for
fifty
sequins
he
replied
in
the
most
friendly
manner
that
he
would
not
give
me
the
trouble
of
going
to
a
banker
for
such
a
wretched
sum
as
that
he
would
be
delighted
to
oblige
me
himself
i
took
the
money
promising
to
repay
him
at
an
early
date
but
i
have
never
been
able
to
do
so
i
do
not
know
whether
he
is
alive
or
dead
but
if
he
were
to
attain
the
age
of
methuselah
i
should
not
entertain
any
hopes
of
paying
him
for
i
get
poorer
every
day
and
feel
that
my
end
is
not
far
off
the
next
day
i
was
in
bologna
and
the
day
after
in
florence
where
i
met
the
chevalier
morosini
nephew
of
the
venetian
procurator
a
young
man
of
nineteen
who
was
travelling
with
count
stratico
professor
of
mathematics
at
the
university
of
padua
he
gave
me
a
letter
for
his
brother
a
jacobin
monk
and
professor
of
literature
at
pisa
where
i
stopped
for
a
couple
of
hours
on
purpose
to
make
the
celebrated
acquaintance
i
found
him
even
greater
than
his
fame
and
promised
to
come
again
to
pisa
and
make
a
longer
stay
for
the
purpose
of
enjoying
his
society
i
stopped
an
hour
at
the
wells
where
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
pretender
to
the
throne
of
great
britain
and
from
there
went
on
to
leghorn
where
i
found
count
orloff
still
waiting
but
only
because
contrary
winds
kept
him
from
sailing
the
english
consul
with
whom
he
was
staying
introduced
me
at
once
to
the
russian
admiral
who
received
me
with
expressions
of
delight
he
told
me
he
would
be
charmed
if
i
would
come
on
board
with
him
he
told
me
to
have
my
luggage
taken
off
at
once
as
he
would
set
sail
with
the
first
fair
wind
when
he
was
gone
the
english
consul
asked
me
what
would
be
my
status
with
the
admiral
that
just
what
i
mean
to
find
out
before
embarking
my
effects
you
wo
be
able
to
speak
to
him
till
next
morning
i
called
on
count
orloff
and
sent
him
in
a
short
note
asking
him
to
give
me
a
short
interview
before
i
embarked
my
mails
an
officer
came
out
to
tell
me
that
the
admiral
was
writing
in
bed
and
hoped
i
would
wait
certainly
i
had
been
waiting
a
few
minutes
when
da
loglio
the
polish
agent
at
venice
and
an
old
friend
of
mine
came
in
what
are
you
doing
here
my
dear
casanova
said
he
i
am
waiting
for
an
interview
with
the
admiral
he
is
very
busy
after
this
da
loglio
coolly
went
into
the
admiral
room
this
was
impertinent
of
him
it
was
as
if
he
said
in
so
many
words
that
the
admiral
was
too
busy
to
see
me
but
not
too
busy
to
see
him
a
moment
after
marquis
manucci
came
in
with
his
order
of
anne
and
his
formal
air
he
congratulated
me
on
my
visit
to
leghorn
and
then
said
he
had
read
my
work
on
venice
and
had
been
surprised
to
find
himself
in
it
he
had
some
reason
for
surprise
for
there
was
no
connection
between
him
and
the
but
he
should
have
discovered
before
that
the
unexpected
often
happens
he
did
not
give
me
time
to
tell
him
so
but
went
into
the
admiral
room
as
da
loglio
had
done
i
was
vexed
to
see
how
these
gentlemen
were
admitted
while
i
danced
attendance
and
the
project
of
sailing
with
orloff
began
to
displease
me
in
five
hours
orloff
came
out
followed
by
a
numerous
train
he
told
me
pleasantly
that
we
could
have
our
talk
at
table
or
after
dinner
after
dinner
if
you
please
i
said
he
came
in
and
sat
down
at
two
and
i
was
among
the
guests
orloff
kept
on
saying
eat
away
gentlemen
eat
away
and
read
his
correspondence
and
gave
his
secretary
letters
all
the
time
after
dinner
he
suddenly
glanced
up
at
me
and
taking
me
by
the
hand
led
me
to
the
window
and
told
me
to
make
haste
with
my
luggage
as
he
should
sail
before
the
morning
if
the
wind
kept
up
quite
so
but
kindly
tell
me
count
what
is
to
be
my
status
or
employment
an
board
your
ship
at
present
i
have
no
special
employ
to
give
you
that
will
come
in
time
come
on
board
as
my
friend
the
offer
is
an
honourable
one
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
but
all
the
other
officers
might
treat
me
with
contempt
i
should
be
regarded
as
a
kind
of
fool
and
i
should
probably
kill
the
first
man
who
dared
to
insult
me
give
me
a
distinct
office
and
let
me
wear
your
uniform
i
will
be
useful
to
you
i
know
the
country
for
which
you
are
bound
i
can
speak
the
language
and
i
am
not
wanting
in
courage
my
dear
sir
i
really
have
no
particular
office
to
give
you
then
count
i
wish
you
a
pleasant
sail
i
am
going
to
rome
i
hope
you
may
never
repent
of
not
taking
me
for
without
me
you
will
never
pass
the
dardanelles
is
that
a
prophecy
it
an
oracle
we
will
test
its
veracity
my
dear
calchus
such
was
the
short
dialogue
i
had
with
the
worthy
count
who
as
a
matter
of
fact
did
not
pass
the
dardanelles
whether
he
would
have
succeeded
if
i
had
been
on
board
is
more
than
i
can
say
next
day
i
delivered
my
letters
to
rivarola
and
the
english
banker
the
squadron
had
sailed
in
the
early
morning
the
day
after
i
went
to
pisa
and
spent
a
pleasant
week
in
the
company
of
father
stratico
who
was
made
a
bishop
two
or
three
years
after
by
means
of
a
bold
stroke
that
might
have
ruined
him
he
delivered
a
funeral
oration
over
father
ricci
the
last
general
of
the
jesuits
the
pope
ganganelli
had
the
choice
of
punishing
the
writer
and
increasing
the
odium
of
many
of
the
faithful
or
of
rewarding
him
handsomely
the
sovereign
pontiff
followed
the
latter
course
i
saw
the
bishop
some
years
later
and
he
told
me
in
confidence
that
he
had
only
written
the
oration
because
he
felt
certain
from
his
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
that
his
punishment
would
be
a
great
reward
this
clever
monk
initiated
me
into
all
the
charms
of
pisan
society
he
had
organized
a
little
choir
of
ladies
of
rank
remarkable
for
their
intelligence
and
beauty
and
had
taught
them
to
sing
extempore
to
the
guitar
he
had
had
them
instructed
by
the
famous
gorilla
who
was
crowned
at
the
capitol
by
night
six
years
later
she
was
crowned
where
our
great
italian
poets
were
crowned
and
though
her
merit
was
no
doubt
great
it
was
nevertheless
more
tinsel
than
gold
and
not
of
that
order
to
place
her
on
a
par
with
petrarch
or
tasso
she
was
satirised
most
bitterly
after
she
had
received
the
bays
and
the
satirists
were
even
more
in
the
wrong
than
the
profaners
of
the
capitol
for
all
the
pamphlets
against
her
laid
stress
on
the
circumstance
that
chastity
at
all
events
was
not
one
of
her
merits
all
poetesses
from
the
days
of
homer
to
our
own
have
sacrificed
on
the
altar
of
venus
no
one
would
have
heard
of
gorilla
if
she
had
not
had
the
sense
to
choose
her
lovers
from
the
ranks
of
literary
men
and
she
would
never
have
been
crowned
at
rome
if
she
had
not
succeeded
in
gaining
over
prince
gonzaga
solferino
who
married
the
pretty
mdlle
rangoni
daughter
of
the
roman
consul
whom
i
knew
at
marseilles
and
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
this
coronation
of
gorilla
is
a
blot
on
the
pontificate
of
the
present
pope
for
henceforth
no
man
of
genuine
merit
will
accept
the
honour
which
was
once
so
carefully
guarded
by
the
giants
of
human
intellect
two
days
after
the
coronation
gorilla
and
her
admirers
left
rome
ashamed
of
what
they
had
done
the
abbe
pizzi
who
had
been
the
chief
promoter
of
her
apotheosis
was
so
inundated
with
pamphlets
and
satires
that
for
some
months
he
dared
not
shew
his
face
this
is
a
long
digression
and
i
will
now
return
to
father
stratico
who
made
the
time
pass
so
pleasantly
for
me
though
he
was
not
a
handsome
man
he
possessed
the
art
of
persuasion
to
perfection
and
he
succeeded
in
inducing
me
to
go
to
sienna
where
he
said
i
should
enjoy
myself
he
gave
me
a
letter
of
introduction
for
the
marchioness
chigi
and
also
one
for
the
abbe
chiaccheri
and
as
i
had
nothing
better
to
do
i
went
to
sienna
by
the
shortest
way
not
caring
to
visit
florence
the
abbe
chiaccheri
gave
me
a
warm
welcome
and
promised
to
do
all
he
could
to
amuse
me
and
he
kept
his
word
he
introduced
me
himself
to
the
marchioness
chigi
who
took
me
by
storm
as
soon
as
she
had
read
the
letter
of
the
abbe
stratico
her
dear
abbe
as
she
called
him
when
she
read
the
superscription
in
his
writing
the
marchioness
was
still
handsome
though
her
beauty
had
begun
to
wane
but
with
her
the
sweetness
the
grace
and
the
ease
of
manner
supplied
the
lack
of
youth
she
knew
how
to
make
a
compliment
of
the
slightest
expression
and
was
totally
devoid
of
any
affection
of
superiority
sit
down
she
began
so
you
are
going
to
stay
a
week
i
see
from
the
dear
abbe
letter
that
a
short
time
for
us
but
perhaps
it
may
be
too
long
for
you
i
hope
the
abbe
has
not
painted
us
in
too
rosy
colours
he
only
told
me
that
i
was
to
spend
a
week
here
and
that
i
should
find
with
you
all
the
charms
of
intellect
and
sensibility
stratico
should
have
condemned
you
to
a
month
without
mercy
why
mercy
what
hazard
do
i
run
of
being
tired
to
death
or
of
leaving
some
small
morsel
of
your
heart
at
sienna
all
that
might
happen
in
a
week
but
i
am
ready
to
dare
the
danger
for
stratico
has
guarded
me
from
the
first
by
counting
on
you
and
from
the
second
by
counting
on
myself
you
will
receive
my
pure
and
intelligent
homage
my
heart
will
go
forth
from
sienna
as
free
as
it
came
for
i
have
no
hope
of
victory
and
defeat
would
make
me
wretched
is
it
possible
that
you
are
amongst
the
despairing
yes
and
to
that
fact
i
owe
my
happiness
it
would
be
a
pity
for
you
if
you
found
yourself
mistaken
not
such
a
pity
as
you
may
think
madam
diem
is
my
motto
is
likewise
the
motto
of
that
finished
voluptuary
horace
but
i
only
take
it
because
it
suits
me
the
pleasure
which
follows
desires
is
the
best
for
it
is
the
most
acute
true
but
it
can
not
be
calculated
on
and
defies
the
philosopher
may
god
preserve
you
madam
from
finding
out
this
painful
truth
by
experience
the
highest
good
lies
in
enjoyment
desire
too
often
remains
unsatisfied
if
you
have
not
yet
found
out
the
truth
of
horace
maxim
i
congratulate
you
the
amiable
marchioness
smiled
pleasantly
and
gave
no
positive
answer
chiaccheri
now
opened
his
mouth
for
the
first
time
and
said
that
the
greatest
happiness
he
could
wish
us
was
that
we
should
never
agree
the
marchioness
assented
rewarding
chiaccheri
with
a
smile
but
i
could
not
do
so
i
had
rather
contradict
you
i
said
than
renounce
all
hopes
of
pleasing
you
the
abbe
has
thrown
the
apple
of
discord
between
us
but
if
we
continue
as
we
have
begun
i
shall
take
up
my
abode
at
sienna
the
marchioness
was
satisfied
with
the
sample
of
her
wit
which
she
had
given
me
and
began
to
talk
commonplaces
asking
me
if
i
should
like
to
see
company
and
enjoy
society
of
the
fair
sex
she
promised
to
take
me
everywhere
pray
do
not
take
the
trouble
i
replied
i
want
to
leave
sienna
with
the
feeling
that
you
are
the
only
lady
to
whom
i
have
done
homage
and
that
the
abbe
chiaccheri
has
been
my
only
guide
the
marchioness
was
flattered
and
asked
the
abbe
and
myself
to
dine
with
her
on
the
following
day
in
a
delightful
house
she
had
at
a
hundred
paces
from
the
town
the
older
i
grew
the
more
i
became
attached
to
the
intellectual
charms
of
women
with
the
sensualist
the
contrary
takes
place
he
becomes
more
material
in
his
old
age
requires
women
well
taught
in
venus
shrines
and
flies
from
all
mention
of
philosophy
as
i
was
leaving
her
i
told
the
abbe
that
if
i
stayed
at
sienna
i
would
see
no
other
woman
but
her
come
what
might
and
he
agreed
that
i
was
very
right
the
abbe
shewed
me
all
the
objects
of
interest
in
sienna
and
introduced
me
to
the
literati
who
in
their
turn
visited
me
the
same
day
chiaccheri
took
me
to
a
house
where
the
learned
society
assembled
it
was
the
residence
of
two
sisters
the
elder
extremely
ugly
and
the
younger
very
pretty
but
the
elder
sister
was
accounted
and
very
rightly
the
corinna
of
the
place
she
asked
me
to
give
her
a
specimen
of
my
skill
promising
to
return
the
compliment
i
recited
the
first
thing
that
came
into
my
head
and
she
replied
with
a
few
lines
of
exquisite
beauty
i
complimented
her
but
chiaccheri
who
had
been
her
master
guessed
that
i
did
not
believe
her
to
be
the
author
and
proposed
that
we
should
try
bouts
rimes
the
pretty
sister
gave
out
the
rhymes
and
we
all
set
to
work
the
ugly
sister
finished
first
and
when
the
verses
came
to
be
read
hers
were
pronounced
the
best
i
was
amazed
and
made
an
improvisation
on
her
skill
which
i
gave
her
in
writing
in
five
minutes
she
returned
it
to
me
the
rhymes
were
the
same
but
the
turn
of
the
thought
was
much
more
elegant
i
was
still
more
surprised
and
took
the
liberty
of
asking
her
name
and
found
her
to
be
the
famous
shepherdess
maria
fortuna
of
the
academy
of
arcadians
i
had
read
the
beautiful
stanzas
she
had
written
in
praise
of
metastasio
i
told
her
so
and
she
brought
me
the
poet
reply
in
manuscript
full
of
admiration
i
addressed
myself
to
her
alone
and
all
her
plainness
vanished
i
had
had
an
agreeable
conversation
with
the
marchioness
in
the
morning
but
in
the
evening
i
was
literally
in
an
ecstacy
i
kept
on
talking
of
fortuna
and
asked
the
abbe
if
she
could
improvise
in
the
manner
of
gorilla
he
replied
that
she
had
wished
to
do
so
but
that
he
had
disallowed
it
and
he
easily
convinced
me
that
this
improvisation
would
have
been
the
ruin
of
her
fine
talent
i
also
agreed
with
him
when
he
said
that
he
had
warned
her
against
making
impromptus
too
frequently
as
such
hasty
verses
are
apt
to
sacrifice
wit
to
rhyme
the
honour
in
which
improvisation
was
held
amongst
the
greeks
and
romans
is
due
to
the
fact
that
greek
and
latin
verse
is
not
under
the
dominion
of
rhyme
but
as
it
was
the
great
poets
seldom
improvised
knowing
as
they
did
that
such
verses
were
usually
feeble
and
horace
often
passed
a
whole
night
searching
for
a
vigorous
and
phrase
when
he
had
succeeded
he
wrote
the
words
on
the
wall
and
went
to
sleep
the
lines
which
cost
him
nothing
are
generally
prosaic
they
may
easily
be
picked
out
in
his
epistles
the
amiable
and
learned
abbe
chiaccheri
confessed
to
me
that
he
was
in
love
with
his
pupil
despite
her
ugliness
he
added
that
he
had
never
expected
it
when
he
began
to
teach
her
to
make
verses
i
ca
understand
that
i
said
sublata
lucerna
you
know
not
at
all
said
he
with
a
laugh
i
love
her
for
her
face
since
it
is
inseparable
from
my
idea
of
her
a
tuscan
has
certainly
more
poetic
riches
at
his
disposal
than
any
other
italian
and
the
siennese
dialect
is
sweeter
and
more
energetic
than
that
of
florence
though
the
latter
claims
the
title
of
the
classic
dialect
on
account
of
its
purity
this
purity
together
with
its
richness
and
copiousness
of
diction
it
owes
to
the
academy
from
the
great
richness
of
italian
we
can
treat
a
subject
with
far
greater
eloquence
than
a
french
writer
italian
abounds
in
synonyms
while
french
is
lamentably
deficient
in
this
respect
voltaire
used
to
laugh
at
those
who
said
that
the
french
tongue
could
not
be
charged
with
poverty
as
it
had
all
that
was
necessary
a
man
may
have
necessaries
and
yet
be
poor
the
obstinacy
of
the
french
academy
in
refusing
to
adopt
foreign
words
skews
more
pride
than
wisdom
this
exclusiveness
can
not
last
as
for
us
we
take
words
from
all
languages
and
all
sources
provided
they
suit
the
genius
of
our
own
language
we
love
to
see
our
riches
increase
we
even
steal
from
the
poor
but
to
do
so
is
the
general
characteristic
of
the
rich
the
amiable
marchioness
gave
us
a
delicious
dinner
in
a
house
designed
by
palladio
chiaccheri
had
warned
me
to
say
nothing
about
the
shepherdess
fortuna
but
at
dinner
she
told
him
she
was
sure
he
had
taken
me
to
her
house
he
had
not
the
face
to
deny
it
and
i
did
not
conceal
the
pleasure
i
had
received
stratico
admires
fortuna
said
the
marchioness
and
i
confess
that
her
writings
have
great
merit
but
it
a
pity
one
can
not
go
to
the
house
except
under
an
incognito
why
not
i
asked
in
some
astonishment
what
said
she
to
the
abbe
you
did
not
tell
him
whose
house
it
is
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
her
father
and
mother
rarely
shew
themselves
well
it
of
no
consequence
but
what
is
her
father
i
asked
the
hangman
perhaps
worse
he
the
and
you
must
see
that
a
stranger
can
not
be
received
into
good
society
here
if
he
goes
to
such
places
as
that
chiaccheri
looked
rather
hurt
and
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
say
that
i
would
not
go
there
again
till
the
eve
of
my
departure
i
saw
her
sister
once
said
the
marchioness
she
is
really
charmingly
pretty
and
it
a
great
pity
that
with
her
beauty
and
irreproachable
morality
she
should
be
condemned
to
marry
a
man
of
her
father
class
i
once
knew
a
man
named
coltellini
i
replied
he
is
the
son
of
the
bargello
of
florence
and
is
to
the
empress
of
russia
i
shall
try
to
make
a
match
between
him
and
fortuna
sister
he
is
a
young
man
of
the
greatest
talents
the
marchioness
thought
my
idea
an
excellent
one
but
soon
after
i
heard
that
coltellini
was
dead
the
is
a
person
all
over
italy
if
you
except
modena
where
the
weak
nobility
make
much
of
the
and
do
justice
to
his
excellent
table
this
is
a
curious
fact
for
as
a
rule
these
bargellos
are
spies
liars
traitors
cheats
and
misanthropes
for
a
man
despised
hates
his
despisers
at
sienna
i
was
shewn
a
count
piccolomini
a
learned
and
agreeable
man
he
had
a
strange
whim
however
of
spending
six
months
in
the
year
in
the
strictest
seclusion
in
his
own
house
never
going
out
and
never
seeing
any
company
reading
and
working
the
whole
time
he
certainly
did
his
best
to
make
up
for
his
hibernation
during
the
other
six
months
in
the
year
the
marchioness
promised
she
would
come
to
rome
in
the
course
of
the
summer
she
had
there
an
intimate
friend
in
bianconi
who
had
abandoned
the
practice
of
medicine
and
was
now
the
representative
of
the
court
of
saxony
on
the
eve
of
my
departure
the
driver
who
was
to
take
me
to
rome
came
and
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
take
a
travelling
companion
and
save
myself
three
sequins
i
do
want
anyone
you
are
wrong
for
she
is
very
beautiful
is
she
by
herself
no
she
is
with
a
gentleman
on
horseback
who
wishes
to
ride
all
the
way
to
rome
then
how
did
the
girl
come
here
on
horseback
but
she
is
tired
out
and
can
not
bear
it
any
longer
the
gentleman
has
offered
me
four
sequins
to
take
her
to
rome
and
as
i
am
a
poor
man
i
think
you
might
let
me
earn
the
money
i
suppose
he
will
follow
the
carriage
he
can
go
as
he
likes
that
ca
make
much
difference
to
either
of
us
you
say
she
is
young
and
pretty
i
have
been
told
so
but
i
have
seen
her
myself
what
sort
of
a
man
is
her
companion
he
a
fine
man
but
he
can
speak
very
little
italian
has
he
sold
the
lady
horse
no
it
was
hired
he
has
only
one
trunk
which
will
go
behind
the
carriage
this
is
all
very
strange
i
shall
not
give
any
decision
before
speaking
to
this
man
i
will
tell
him
to
wait
on
you
directly
afterwards
a
young
fellow
carrying
himself
well
enough
and
clad
in
a
fancy
uniform
came
in
he
told
me
the
tale
i
had
heard
from
the
coachman
and
ended
by
saying
that
he
was
sure
i
would
not
refuse
to
accommodate
his
wife
in
my
carriage
your
wife
sir
i
saw
he
was
a
frenchman
and
i
addressed
him
in
french
god
be
praised
you
can
speak
my
native
tongue
yes
sir
she
is
an
englishwoman
and
my
wife
i
am
sure
she
will
be
no
trouble
to
you
very
good
i
do
want
to
start
later
than
i
had
arranged
will
she
be
ready
at
five
certainly
the
next
morning
when
i
got
into
my
carriage
i
found
her
already
there
i
paid
her
some
slight
compliment
and
sat
down
beside
her
and
we
drove
off
chapter
xii
miss
betty
the
comte
de
sir
b
m
reassured
this
was
the
fourth
adventure
i
had
had
of
this
kind
there
is
nothing
particularly
out
of
the
common
in
having
a
in
carriage
this
time
however
the
affair
had
something
decidedly
romantic
about
it
i
was
and
my
purse
contained
two
hundred
sequins
i
still
loved
the
fair
sex
though
my
ardour
had
decreased
my
experience
had
ripened
and
my
caution
increased
i
was
more
like
a
heavy
father
than
a
young
lover
and
i
limited
myself
to
pretensions
of
the
most
modest
character
the
young
person
beside
me
was
pretty
and
she
was
neatly
though
simply
dressed
in
the
english
fashion
she
was
fair
and
small
and
her
budding
breast
could
be
seen
outlined
beneath
the
fine
muslin
of
her
dress
she
had
all
the
appearances
of
modesty
and
noble
birth
and
something
of
virginal
innocence
which
inspired
one
with
attachment
and
respect
at
the
same
time
i
hope
you
can
speak
french
madam
i
began
yes
and
a
little
italian
too
i
congratulate
myself
on
having
you
for
my
travelling
companion
i
think
you
should
congratulate
me
i
heard
you
came
to
sienna
on
horseback
yes
but
i
will
never
do
such
a
foolish
thing
again
i
think
your
husband
would
have
been
wise
to
sell
his
horse
and
buy
a
carriage
he
hired
it
it
does
not
belong
to
him
from
rome
we
are
going
to
drive
to
naples
you
like
travelling
very
much
but
with
greater
comfort
with
these
words
the
english
girl
whose
white
skin
did
not
look
as
if
it
could
contain
a
drop
of
blood
blushed
most
violently
i
guessed
something
of
her
secret
and
begged
pardon
and
for
more
than
an
hour
i
remain
silent
pretending
to
gaze
at
the
scenery
but
in
reality
thinking
of
her
for
she
began
to
inspire
me
with
a
lively
interest
though
the
position
of
my
young
companion
was
more
than
equivocal
i
determined
to
see
my
way
clearly
before
i
took
any
decisive
step
and
i
waited
patiently
till
we
got
to
bon
couvent
where
we
expected
to
dine
and
meet
the
husband
we
got
there
at
ten
in
italy
the
carriages
never
go
faster
than
a
walk
a
man
on
foot
can
outstrip
them
as
they
rarely
exceed
three
miles
an
hour
the
tedium
of
a
journey
under
such
circumstances
is
something
dreadful
and
in
the
hot
months
one
has
to
stop
five
or
six
hours
in
the
middle
of
the
day
to
avoid
falling
my
coachman
said
he
did
not
want
to
go
beyond
quirico
where
there
was
an
excellent
inn
that
night
so
he
proposed
waiting
at
bon
couvent
till
four
we
had
therefore
six
hours
wherein
to
rest
the
english
girl
was
astonished
at
not
finding
her
husband
and
looked
for
him
in
all
directions
i
noticed
her
and
asked
the
landlord
what
had
become
of
him
he
informed
us
that
he
had
breakfasted
and
baited
his
horse
and
had
then
gone
on
leaving
word
that
he
would
await
us
at
quirico
and
order
supper
there
i
thought
it
all
very
strange
but
i
said
nothing
the
poor
girl
begged
me
to
excuse
her
husband
behaviour
he
has
given
me
a
mark
of
his
confidence
madam
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
offended
at
the
landlord
asked
me
if
the
vetturino
paid
my
expenses
and
i
answered
in
the
negative
and
the
girl
then
told
him
to
ask
the
vetturino
if
he
was
paying
for
her
the
man
came
in
and
to
convince
the
lady
that
providing
her
with
meals
was
not
in
the
contract
he
gave
her
a
paper
which
she
handed
to
me
to
read
it
was
signed
comte
de
when
she
was
alone
with
me
my
young
companion
begged
me
only
to
order
dinner
for
myself
i
understood
her
delicacy
and
this
made
her
all
the
dearer
to
me
madame
said
i
you
must
please
look
upon
me
as
an
old
friend
i
guess
you
have
no
money
about
you
and
that
you
wish
to
fast
from
motives
of
delicacy
your
husband
shall
repay
me
if
he
will
have
it
so
if
i
told
the
landlord
to
only
prepare
dinner
for
myself
i
should
be
dishonouring
the
count
yourself
possibly
and
myself
most
of
all
i
feel
you
are
right
sir
let
dinner
be
served
for
two
then
but
i
can
not
eat
for
i
feel
ill
and
i
hope
you
will
not
mind
my
lying
on
the
bed
for
a
moment
pray
do
not
let
me
disturb
you
this
is
a
pleasant
room
and
they
can
lay
the
table
in
the
next
lie
down
and
sleep
if
you
can
and
i
will
order
dinner
to
be
ready
by
two
i
hope
you
will
be
feeling
better
by
then
i
left
her
without
giving
her
time
to
answer
and
went
to
order
dinner
i
had
ceased
to
believe
the
frenchman
to
be
the
beautiful
husband
and
began
to
think
i
should
have
to
fight
him
the
case
i
felt
certain
was
one
of
elopement
and
seduction
and
superstitious
as
usual
i
was
sure
that
my
good
genius
had
sent
me
in
the
nick
of
time
to
save
her
and
care
for
her
and
in
short
to
snatch
her
from
the
hands
of
her
infamous
deceiver
thus
i
fondled
my
growing
passion
i
laughed
at
the
absurd
title
the
rascal
had
given
himself
and
when
the
thought
struck
me
that
he
had
possibly
abandoned
her
to
me
altogether
i
made
up
my
mind
that
he
deserved
hanging
nevertheless
i
resolved
never
to
leave
her
i
lay
down
on
the
bed
and
as
i
built
a
thousand
castles
in
the
air
i
fell
asleep
the
landlady
awoke
me
softly
saying
that
three
had
struck
wait
a
moment
before
you
bring
in
the
dinner
i
will
go
and
see
if
the
lady
is
awake
i
opened
the
door
gently
and
saw
she
was
still
asleep
but
as
i
closed
the
door
after
me
the
noise
awoke
her
and
she
asked
if
i
had
dined
i
shall
not
take
any
dinner
madam
unless
you
do
me
the
honour
to
dine
with
me
you
have
had
a
five
hours
rest
and
i
hope
you
are
better
i
will
sit
down
with
you
to
dinner
as
you
wish
it
that
makes
me
happy
and
i
will
order
dinner
to
be
served
forthwith
she
ate
little
but
what
little
she
did
eat
was
taken
with
a
good
appetite
she
was
agreeably
surprised
to
see
the
beefsteaks
and
plum
pudding
which
i
had
ordered
for
her
when
the
landlady
came
in
she
asked
her
if
the
cook
was
an
englishman
and
when
she
heard
that
i
had
given
directions
for
the
preparation
of
her
national
dishes
she
seemed
full
of
gratitude
she
cheered
up
and
congratulated
me
on
my
appetite
while
i
encouraged
her
to
drink
some
excellent
montepulciano
and
montefiascone
by
dessert
she
was
in
good
spirits
while
i
felt
rather
excited
she
told
me
in
italian
that
she
was
born
in
london
and
i
thought
i
should
have
died
with
joy
in
reply
to
my
question
whether
she
knew
madame
cornelis
she
replied
that
she
had
known
her
daughter
as
they
had
been
at
school
together
has
sophie
grown
tall
no
she
is
quite
small
but
she
is
very
pretty
and
so
clever
she
must
now
be
seventeen
exactly
we
are
of
the
same
age
as
she
said
this
she
blushed
and
lowered
her
eyes
are
you
ill
not
at
all
i
scarcely
like
to
say
it
but
sophie
is
the
very
image
of
you
why
should
you
hesitate
to
say
so
it
has
been
remarked
to
me
before
no
doubt
it
is
a
mere
coincidence
how
long
ago
is
it
since
you
have
seen
her
eighteen
months
she
went
back
to
her
mother
to
be
married
as
it
was
said
but
i
do
know
to
whom
your
news
interests
me
deeply
the
landlord
brought
me
the
bill
and
i
saw
a
note
of
three
pains
which
her
husband
had
spent
on
himself
and
his
horse
he
said
you
would
pay
observed
the
landlord
the
englishwoman
blushed
i
paid
the
bill
and
we
went
on
i
was
delighted
to
see
her
blushing
it
proved
she
was
not
a
party
to
her
husband
proceedings
i
was
burning
with
the
desire
to
know
how
she
had
left
london
and
had
met
the
frenchman
and
why
they
were
going
to
rome
but
i
did
not
want
to
trouble
her
by
my
questions
and
i
loved
her
too
well
already
to
give
her
any
pain
we
had
a
three
hours
drive
before
us
so
i
turned
the
conversation
to
sophie
with
whom
she
had
been
at
school
was
miss
nancy
steyne
there
when
you
left
said
i
the
reader
may
remember
how
fond
i
had
been
of
this
young
lady
who
had
dined
with
me
and
whom
i
had
covered
with
kisses
though
she
was
only
twelve
my
companion
sighed
at
hearing
the
name
of
nancy
and
told
me
that
she
had
left
was
she
pretty
when
you
knew
her
she
was
a
beauty
but
her
loveliness
was
a
fatal
gift
to
her
nancy
was
a
close
friend
of
mine
we
loved
each
other
tenderly
and
perhaps
our
sympathy
arose
from
the
similarity
of
the
fate
in
store
for
us
nancy
too
loving
and
too
simple
is
now
perhaps
even
more
unhappy
than
myself
more
unhappy
what
do
you
mean
alas
is
it
possible
that
fate
has
treated
you
harshly
is
it
possible
that
you
can
be
unhappy
with
such
a
letter
of
commendation
as
nature
has
given
you
alas
let
us
speak
of
something
else
her
countenance
was
suffused
with
emotion
i
pitied
her
in
secret
and
led
the
conversation
back
to
nancy
tell
me
why
you
think
nancy
is
unhappy
she
ran
away
with
a
young
man
she
loved
they
despaired
of
gaining
the
parents
consent
to
the
match
since
her
flight
nothing
has
been
heard
of
her
and
you
see
i
have
some
reason
to
fear
that
she
is
unhappy
you
are
right
i
would
willingly
give
my
life
if
it
could
be
the
saving
of
her
where
did
you
know
her
in
my
own
house
she
and
sophie
dined
with
me
and
her
father
came
in
at
the
end
of
the
meal
now
i
know
who
you
are
how
often
have
i
heard
sophie
talking
of
you
nancy
loved
you
as
well
as
her
father
i
heard
that
you
had
gone
to
russia
and
had
fought
a
duel
with
a
general
in
poland
is
this
true
how
i
wish
i
could
tell
dear
sophie
all
this
but
i
may
not
entertain
such
hopes
now
you
have
heard
the
truth
about
me
but
what
should
prevent
you
writing
what
you
like
to
england
i
take
a
lively
interest
in
you
trust
in
me
and
i
promise
you
that
you
shall
communicate
with
whom
you
please
i
am
vastly
obliged
to
you
with
these
words
she
became
silent
and
i
left
her
to
her
thoughts
at
seven
we
arrived
at
quirico
and
the
comte
de
came
out
and
welcomed
his
wife
in
the
most
loving
fashion
kissing
her
before
everybody
no
doubt
with
the
object
of
giving
people
to
understand
that
she
was
his
wife
and
i
her
father
the
girl
responded
to
all
his
caresses
looking
as
if
a
load
had
been
lifted
off
her
breast
and
without
a
word
of
reproach
she
went
upstairs
with
him
having
apparently
forgotten
my
existence
i
set
that
down
to
love
youth
and
the
forgetfulness
natural
to
that
early
age
i
went
upstairs
in
my
turn
with
my
carpet
bag
and
supper
was
served
directly
as
we
had
to
start
very
early
the
next
morning
if
we
wished
to
reach
radicofani
before
the
noonday
heat
we
had
an
excellent
supper
as
the
count
had
preceded
us
by
six
hours
and
the
landlord
had
had
plenty
of
time
to
make
his
preparations
the
english
girl
seemed
as
much
in
love
with
de
as
he
with
her
and
i
was
left
completely
out
in
the
cold
i
can
not
describe
the
high
spirits
the
somewhat
risky
sallies
and
the
outrageous
humours
of
the
young
gentleman
the
girl
laughed
with
all
her
heart
and
i
could
not
help
laughing
too
i
considered
that
i
was
present
at
a
kind
of
comedy
and
not
a
gesture
not
a
word
not
a
laugh
did
i
allow
to
escape
me
he
may
be
merely
a
rich
and
young
officer
i
said
to
myself
who
treats
everything
in
this
farcical
manner
he
wo
be
the
first
of
the
species
i
have
seen
they
are
amusing
but
frivolous
and
sometimes
dangerous
wearing
their
honour
lightly
and
too
apt
to
carry
it
at
the
sword
point
on
this
hypothesis
i
was
ill
pleased
with
my
position
i
did
not
much
like
his
manner
towards
myself
he
seemed
to
be
making
a
dupe
of
me
and
behaved
all
the
while
as
if
he
were
doing
me
an
honour
on
the
supposition
that
the
englishwoman
was
his
wife
his
treatment
of
myself
was
certainly
not
warranted
and
i
was
not
the
man
to
play
zero
i
could
not
disguise
the
fact
however
that
any
onlooker
would
have
pronounced
me
to
be
playing
an
inferior
part
there
were
two
beds
in
the
room
where
we
had
our
supper
when
the
chambermaid
came
to
put
on
the
sheets
i
told
her
to
give
me
another
room
the
count
politely
begged
me
to
sleep
in
the
same
room
with
them
and
the
lady
remained
neutral
but
i
did
not
much
care
for
their
company
and
insisted
on
leaving
them
alone
i
had
my
carpet
bag
taken
to
my
room
wished
them
a
good
night
and
locked
myself
in
my
friends
had
only
one
small
trunk
whence
i
concluded
that
they
had
sent
on
their
luggage
by
another
way
but
they
did
not
even
have
the
trunk
brought
up
to
their
room
i
went
to
bed
tranquilly
feeling
much
less
interested
about
the
lady
than
i
had
been
on
the
journey
i
was
roused
early
in
the
morning
and
made
a
hasty
toilette
i
could
hear
my
neighbours
dressing
so
i
half
opened
my
door
and
wished
them
good
day
without
going
into
their
room
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
heard
the
sound
of
a
dispute
in
the
and
on
looking
out
there
were
the
frenchman
and
the
vetturino
arguing
hotly
the
vetturino
held
the
horse
bridle
and
the
pretended
count
did
his
best
to
snatch
it
away
from
him
i
guessed
the
bone
of
contention
the
frenchman
had
no
money
and
the
vetturino
asked
in
vain
for
his
due
i
knew
that
i
should
be
drawn
into
the
dispute
and
was
making
up
my
mind
to
do
my
duty
without
mercy
when
the
count
de
came
in
and
said
this
blockhead
does
not
understand
what
i
say
to
him
but
as
he
may
have
right
on
his
side
i
must
ask
you
to
give
him
two
sequins
i
will
return
you
the
money
at
rome
by
an
odd
chance
i
happen
to
have
no
money
about
me
but
the
fellow
might
trust
me
as
he
has
got
my
trunk
however
he
says
he
must
be
paid
so
will
you
kindly
oblige
me
you
shall
hear
more
of
me
at
rome
without
waiting
for
me
to
reply
the
rascal
went
out
and
ran
down
the
stairs
the
vetturino
remained
in
the
room
i
put
my
head
out
of
the
window
and
saw
him
leap
on
horseback
and
gallop
away
i
sat
down
on
my
bed
and
turned
the
scene
over
in
my
mind
rubbing
my
hands
gently
at
last
i
went
off
into
a
mad
roar
of
laughter
it
struck
me
as
so
whimsical
and
original
an
adventure
laugh
too
said
i
to
the
lady
laugh
or
i
will
never
get
up
i
agree
with
you
that
it
laughable
enough
but
i
have
not
the
spirit
to
laugh
well
sit
down
at
all
events
i
gave
the
poor
devil
of
a
vetturino
two
sequins
telling
him
that
i
should
like
some
coffee
and
to
start
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
was
grieved
to
see
my
companion
sadness
i
understand
your
grief
said
i
but
you
must
try
to
overcome
it
i
have
only
one
favour
to
ask
of
you
and
if
you
refuse
to
grant
me
that
i
shall
be
as
sad
as
you
so
we
shall
be
rather
a
melancholy
couple
what
can
i
do
for
you
you
can
tell
me
on
your
word
of
honour
whether
that
extraordinary
character
is
your
husband
or
only
your
lover
i
will
tell
you
the
simple
truth
he
is
not
my
husband
but
we
are
going
to
be
married
at
rome
i
breathe
again
he
never
shall
be
your
husband
and
so
much
the
better
for
you
he
has
seduced
you
and
you
love
him
but
you
will
soon
get
over
that
never
unless
he
deceives
me
he
has
deceived
you
already
i
am
sure
he
has
told
you
that
he
is
rich
that
he
is
a
man
of
rank
and
that
he
will
make
you
happy
and
all
that
is
a
lie
how
can
you
know
all
this
experience
experience
is
my
great
teacher
your
lover
is
a
young
a
man
of
no
worth
he
might
possibly
marry
you
but
it
would
be
only
to
support
himself
by
the
sale
of
your
charms
he
loves
me
i
am
sure
of
it
yes
he
loves
you
but
not
with
the
love
of
a
man
of
honour
without
knowing
my
name
or
my
character
or
anything
about
me
he
delivered
you
over
to
my
tender
mercies
a
man
of
any
delicacy
would
never
abandon
his
loved
one
thus
he
is
not
jealous
you
know
frenchmen
are
not
a
man
of
honour
is
the
same
in
france
and
england
and
italy
and
all
the
world
over
if
he
loved
you
would
he
have
left
you
penniless
in
this
fashion
what
would
you
do
if
i
were
inclined
to
play
the
brutal
lover
you
may
speak
freely
i
should
defend
myself
very
good
then
i
should
abandon
you
here
and
what
would
you
do
then
you
are
pretty
you
are
a
woman
of
sensibility
but
many
men
would
take
but
little
account
of
your
virtue
your
lover
has
left
you
to
me
for
all
he
knew
i
might
be
the
vilest
wretch
but
as
it
is
cheer
up
you
have
nothing
to
fear
how
can
you
think
that
adventurer
loves
you
he
is
a
mere
monster
i
am
sorry
that
what
i
say
makes
you
weep
but
it
must
be
said
i
even
dare
tell
you
that
i
have
taken
a
great
liking
to
you
but
you
may
feel
quite
sure
that
i
shall
not
ask
you
to
give
me
so
much
as
a
kiss
and
i
will
never
abandon
you
before
we
get
to
rome
i
shall
convince
you
that
the
count
as
he
calls
himself
not
only
does
not
love
you
but
is
a
common
swindler
as
well
as
a
deceiver
you
will
convince
me
of
that
yes
on
my
word
of
honour
dry
your
eyes
and
let
us
try
to
make
this
day
pass
as
pleasantly
as
yesterday
you
can
not
imagine
how
glad
i
feel
that
chance
has
constituted
me
your
protector
i
want
you
to
feel
assured
of
my
friendship
and
if
you
do
not
give
me
a
little
love
in
return
i
will
try
and
bear
it
patiently
the
landlord
came
in
and
brought
the
bill
for
the
count
and
his
mistress
as
well
as
for
myself
i
had
expected
this
and
paid
it
without
a
word
and
without
looking
at
the
poor
wandering
sheep
beside
me
i
recollected
that
too
strong
medicines
kill
and
do
not
cure
and
i
was
afraid
i
had
said
almost
too
much
i
longed
to
know
her
history
and
felt
sure
i
should
hear
it
before
we
reached
rome
we
took
some
coffee
and
departed
and
not
a
word
passed
between
us
till
we
got
to
the
inn
at
la
scala
where
we
got
down
the
road
from
la
scala
to
radicofani
is
steep
and
troublesome
the
vetturino
would
require
an
extra
horse
and
even
then
would
have
taken
four
hours
i
decided
therefore
to
take
two
post
horses
and
not
to
begin
the
journey
till
ten
would
it
not
be
better
to
go
on
now
said
the
english
girl
it
will
be
very
hot
from
ten
till
noon
yes
but
the
comte
de
whom
we
should
be
sure
to
meet
at
radicofani
would
not
like
to
see
me
why
not
i
am
sure
he
would
if
i
had
told
her
my
reason
she
would
have
wept
anew
so
in
pity
i
spared
her
i
saw
that
she
was
blinded
by
love
and
could
not
see
the
true
character
of
her
lover
it
would
be
impossible
to
cure
her
by
gentle
and
persuasive
argument
i
must
speak
sharply
the
wound
must
be
subjected
to
the
actual
cautery
but
was
virtue
the
cause
of
all
this
interest
was
it
devotion
to
a
young
and
innocent
girl
that
made
me
willing
to
undertake
so
difficult
and
so
delicate
a
task
doubtless
these
motives
went
for
something
but
i
will
not
attempt
to
strut
in
borrowed
plumes
and
must
freely
confess
that
if
she
had
been
ugly
and
stupid
i
should
probably
have
left
her
to
her
fate
in
short
selfishness
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
so
let
us
say
no
more
about
virtue
my
true
aim
was
to
snatch
this
delicate
morsel
from
another
hand
that
i
might
enjoy
it
myself
i
did
not
confess
as
much
to
myself
for
i
could
never
bear
to
calmly
view
my
own
failings
but
afterwards
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
acted
a
part
throughout
is
selfishness
then
the
universal
motor
of
our
actions
i
am
afraid
it
is
i
made
betty
such
was
her
name
take
a
country
walk
with
me
and
the
scenery
there
is
so
beautiful
that
no
poet
nor
painter
could
imagine
a
more
delicious
prospect
betty
spoke
tuscan
with
english
idioms
and
an
english
accent
but
her
voice
was
so
silvery
and
clear
that
her
italian
was
delightful
to
listen
to
i
longed
to
kiss
her
lips
as
they
spoke
so
sweetly
but
i
respected
her
and
restrained
myself
we
were
walking
along
engaged
in
agreeable
converse
when
all
at
once
we
heard
the
church
bells
peal
out
betty
said
she
had
never
seen
a
catholic
service
and
i
was
glad
to
give
her
that
pleasure
it
was
the
feast
day
of
some
local
saint
and
betty
assisted
at
high
mass
with
all
propriety
imitating
the
gestures
of
the
people
so
that
no
one
would
have
taken
her
for
a
protestant
after
it
was
over
she
said
she
thought
the
catholic
rite
was
much
more
adapted
to
the
needs
of
loving
souls
than
the
angelican
she
was
astonished
at
the
southern
beauty
of
the
village
girls
whom
she
pronounced
to
be
much
handsomer
that
the
country
lasses
in
england
she
asked
me
the
time
and
i
replied
without
thinking
that
i
wondered
she
had
not
got
a
watch
she
blushed
and
said
the
count
had
asked
her
to
give
it
him
to
leave
in
pawn
for
the
horse
he
hired
i
was
sorry
for
what
i
had
said
for
i
had
put
betty
who
was
incapable
of
a
lie
to
great
pain
we
started
at
ten
with
three
horses
and
as
a
cool
wind
was
blowing
we
had
a
pleasant
drive
arriving
at
radicofani
at
noon
the
landlord
who
was
also
the
postmaster
asked
if
i
would
pay
three
pauls
which
the
frenchman
had
expended
for
his
horse
and
himself
assuring
the
landlord
that
his
friend
would
pay
for
betty
sake
i
said
i
would
pay
but
this
was
not
all
the
gentleman
added
the
man
has
beaten
three
of
my
postillions
with
his
naked
sword
one
of
them
was
wounded
in
the
face
and
he
has
followed
his
assailant
and
will
make
him
pay
dearly
for
it
the
reason
of
the
assault
was
that
they
wanted
to
detain
him
till
he
had
paid
you
were
wrong
to
allow
violence
to
be
used
he
does
not
look
like
a
thief
and
you
might
have
taken
it
for
granted
that
i
should
pay
you
are
mistaken
i
was
not
obliged
to
take
anything
of
the
sort
for
granted
i
have
been
cheated
in
this
sort
many
times
before
your
dinner
is
ready
if
you
want
any
poor
betty
was
in
despair
she
observed
a
distressed
silence
and
i
tried
to
raise
her
spirits
and
to
make
her
eat
a
good
dinner
and
to
taste
the
excellent
muscat
of
which
the
host
had
provided
an
enormous
flask
all
my
efforts
were
in
vain
so
i
called
the
vetturino
to
tell
him
that
i
wanted
to
start
directly
after
dinner
this
order
acted
on
betty
like
magic
you
mean
to
go
as
far
as
centino
i
suppose
said
the
man
we
had
better
wait
there
till
the
heat
is
over
no
we
must
push
on
as
the
lady
husband
may
be
in
need
of
help
the
wounded
postillion
has
followed
him
and
as
he
speaks
italian
very
imperfectly
there
no
knowing
what
may
happen
to
him
very
good
we
will
go
off
betty
looked
at
me
with
the
utmost
gratitude
and
by
way
of
proving
it
she
pretended
to
have
a
good
appetite
she
had
noticed
that
this
was
a
certain
way
of
pleasing
me
while
we
were
at
dinner
i
ordered
up
one
of
the
beaten
postillions
and
heard
his
story
he
was
a
frank
rogue
he
said
he
had
received
some
blows
with
the
flat
of
the
sword
but
he
boasted
of
having
sent
a
stone
after
the
frenchman
which
must
have
made
an
impression
on
him
i
gave
him
a
paul
and
promised
to
make
it
a
crown
if
he
would
go
to
centino
to
bear
witness
against
his
comrade
and
he
immediately
began
to
speak
up
for
the
count
much
to
betty
amusement
he
said
the
wound
in
the
face
was
a
mere
scratch
and
that
he
had
brought
it
on
himself
as
he
had
no
business
to
oppose
a
traveller
as
he
had
done
by
way
of
comfort
he
told
us
that
the
frenchman
had
only
been
hit
by
two
or
three
stones
betty
did
not
find
this
very
consoling
but
i
saw
that
the
affair
was
more
comic
than
tragic
and
would
end
in
nothing
the
postillion
went
off
and
we
followed
him
in
half
an
hour
betty
was
tranquil
enough
till
we
got
there
and
heard
that
the
count
had
gone
on
to
acquapendente
with
the
two
postillions
at
his
heels
she
seemed
quite
vexed
i
told
her
that
all
would
be
well
that
the
count
knew
how
to
defend
himself
but
she
only
answered
me
with
a
deep
sigh
i
suspected
that
she
was
afraid
we
should
have
to
pass
the
night
together
and
that
i
would
demand
some
payment
for
all
the
trouble
i
had
taken
would
you
like
us
to
go
on
to
acquapendente
i
asked
her
at
this
question
her
face
beamed
all
over
she
opened
her
arms
and
i
embraced
her
i
called
the
vetturino
and
told
him
i
wanted
to
go
on
to
acquapendente
immediately
the
fellow
replied
that
his
horses
were
in
the
stable
and
that
he
was
not
going
to
put
them
in
but
that
i
could
have
post
horses
if
i
liked
very
good
get
me
two
horses
immediately
it
is
my
belief
that
if
i
had
liked
betty
would
have
given
me
everything
at
that
moment
for
she
let
herself
fall
into
my
arms
i
pressed
her
tenderly
and
kissed
her
and
that
was
all
she
seemed
grateful
for
my
the
horses
were
put
in
and
after
i
had
paid
the
landlord
for
the
supper
which
he
swore
he
had
prepared
for
us
we
started
we
reached
acquapendente
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
and
we
found
the
madcap
count
in
high
spirits
he
embraced
his
dulcinea
with
transports
and
betty
seemed
delighted
to
find
him
safe
and
sound
he
told
us
triumphantly
that
he
had
beaten
the
rascally
postillions
and
had
warded
their
stones
off
where
the
slashed
postillion
i
asked
he
is
drinking
to
my
health
with
his
comrade
they
have
both
begged
my
pardon
yes
said
betty
this
gentleman
gave
him
a
crown
what
a
pity
you
should
have
given
them
anything
before
supper
the
comte
de
skewed
us
the
bruises
on
his
thighs
and
side
the
rascal
was
a
fine
fellow
however
adoring
airs
irritated
me
though
i
was
consoled
at
the
thought
of
the
earnest
i
had
received
from
her
next
day
the
impudent
fellow
told
me
that
he
would
order
us
a
good
supper
at
viterbo
and
that
of
course
i
would
lend
him
a
sequin
to
pay
for
his
dinner
at
montefiascone
so
saying
he
skewed
me
in
an
way
a
bill
of
exchange
on
rome
for
three
thousand
crowns
i
did
not
trouble
to
read
it
and
gave
him
the
sequin
though
i
felt
sure
i
should
never
see
it
again
betty
now
treated
me
quite
confidentially
and
i
felt
i
might
ask
her
almost
any
questions
when
we
were
at
montefiascone
she
said
you
see
my
lover
is
only
without
money
by
chance
he
has
a
bill
of
exchange
for
a
large
amount
i
believe
it
to
be
a
forgery
you
are
really
too
cruel
not
at
all
i
only
wish
i
were
mistaken
but
i
am
sure
of
the
contrary
twenty
years
ago
i
should
have
taken
it
for
a
good
one
but
now
another
thing
and
if
the
bill
is
a
good
one
why
did
he
not
negotiate
it
at
sienna
florence
or
leghorn
it
may
be
that
he
had
not
the
time
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
be
gone
ah
if
you
knew
all
i
only
want
to
know
what
you
like
to
tell
me
but
i
warn
you
again
that
what
i
say
is
no
vague
suspicion
but
hard
fact
then
you
persist
in
the
idea
that
he
does
not
love
me
nay
he
loves
you
but
in
such
a
fashion
as
to
deserve
hatred
in
return
how
do
you
mean
would
you
not
hate
a
man
who
loved
you
only
to
traffic
in
your
charms
i
should
be
sorry
for
you
to
think
that
of
him
if
you
like
i
will
convince
you
of
what
i
say
this
evening
you
will
oblige
me
but
i
must
have
some
positive
proof
it
would
be
a
sore
pain
to
me
but
also
a
true
service
and
when
you
are
convinced
will
you
cease
to
love
him
certainly
if
you
prove
him
to
be
dishonest
my
love
will
vanish
away
you
are
mistaken
you
will
still
love
him
even
when
you
have
had
proof
positive
of
his
wickedness
he
has
evidently
fascinated
you
in
a
deadly
manner
or
you
would
see
his
character
in
its
true
light
before
this
all
this
may
be
true
but
do
you
give
me
your
proofs
and
leave
to
me
the
care
of
shewing
that
i
despise
him
i
will
prove
my
assertions
this
evening
but
tell
me
how
long
you
have
known
him
about
a
month
but
we
have
only
been
together
for
five
days
and
before
that
time
you
never
accorded
him
any
favours
not
a
single
kiss
he
was
always
under
my
windows
and
i
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
loved
me
fondly
oh
yes
he
loves
you
who
would
not
but
his
love
is
not
that
of
a
man
of
honour
but
that
of
an
impudent
profligate
but
how
can
you
suspect
a
man
of
whom
you
know
nothing
would
that
i
did
not
know
him
i
feel
sure
that
not
being
able
to
visit
you
he
made
you
visit
him
and
then
persuaded
you
to
fly
with
him
yes
he
did
he
wrote
me
a
letter
which
i
will
shew
you
he
promises
to
marry
me
at
rome
and
who
is
to
answer
for
his
constancy
his
love
is
my
surety
do
you
fear
pursuit
no
did
he
take
you
from
a
father
a
lover
or
a
brother
from
a
lover
who
will
not
be
back
at
leghorn
for
a
week
or
ten
days
where
has
he
gone
to
london
on
business
i
was
under
the
charge
of
a
woman
whom
he
trusted
that
enough
i
pity
you
my
poor
betty
tell
me
if
you
love
your
englishman
and
if
he
is
worthy
of
your
love
alas
i
loved
him
dearly
till
i
saw
this
frenchman
who
made
me
unfaithful
to
a
man
i
adored
he
will
be
in
despair
at
not
finding
me
when
he
returns
is
he
rich
not
very
he
is
a
business
man
and
is
comfortably
off
is
he
young
no
he
is
a
man
of
your
age
and
a
thoroughly
kind
and
honest
person
he
was
waiting
for
his
consumptive
wife
to
die
to
marry
me
poor
man
have
you
presented
him
with
a
child
no
i
am
sure
god
did
not
mean
me
for
him
for
the
count
has
conquered
me
completely
everyone
whom
love
leads
astray
says
the
same
thing
now
you
have
heard
everything
and
i
am
glad
i
told
you
for
i
am
sure
you
are
my
friend
i
will
be
a
better
friend
to
you
dear
betty
in
the
future
than
in
the
past
you
will
need
my
services
and
i
promise
not
to
abandon
you
i
love
you
as
i
have
said
but
so
long
as
you
continue
to
love
the
frenchman
i
shall
only
ask
you
to
consider
me
as
your
friend
i
accept
your
promise
and
in
return
i
promise
not
to
hide
anything
from
you
tell
me
why
you
have
no
luggage
i
escaped
on
horseback
but
my
trunk
which
is
full
of
linen
and
other
effects
will
be
at
rome
two
days
after
us
i
sent
it
off
the
day
before
my
escape
and
the
man
who
received
it
was
sent
by
the
count
then
to
your
trunk
why
you
foresee
nothing
but
misfortune
well
dear
betty
i
only
wish
my
prophecies
may
not
be
accomplished
although
you
escaped
on
horseback
i
think
you
should
have
brought
a
cloak
and
a
carpet
bag
with
some
linen
all
that
is
in
the
small
trunk
i
shall
have
it
taken
into
my
room
tonight
we
reached
viterbo
at
seven
and
found
the
count
very
cheerful
in
accordance
with
the
plot
i
had
laid
against
the
count
i
began
by
shewing
myself
demonstratively
fond
of
betty
envying
the
fortunate
lover
praising
his
heroic
behaviour
in
leaving
her
to
me
and
so
forth
the
silly
fellow
proceeded
to
back
me
up
in
my
extravagant
admiration
he
boasted
that
jealousy
was
utterly
foreign
to
his
character
and
maintained
that
the
true
lover
would
accustom
himself
to
see
his
mistress
inspire
desires
in
other
men
he
proceeded
to
make
a
long
dissertation
on
this
theme
and
i
let
him
go
on
for
i
was
waiting
till
after
supper
to
come
to
the
conclusive
point
during
the
meal
i
made
him
drink
and
applauded
his
freedom
from
vulgar
prejudices
at
dessert
he
enlarged
on
the
duty
of
reciprocity
between
lovers
thus
he
remarked
betty
ought
to
procure
me
the
enjoyment
of
fanny
if
she
has
reason
to
think
i
have
taken
a
fancy
to
her
and
per
contra
as
i
adore
betty
if
i
found
that
she
loved
you
i
should
procure
her
the
pleasure
of
sleeping
with
you
betty
listened
to
all
this
nonsense
in
silent
astonishment
i
confess
my
dear
count
i
replied
that
theoretically
speaking
your
system
strikes
me
as
sublime
and
calculated
to
bring
about
the
return
of
the
golden
age
but
i
am
afraid
it
would
prove
absurd
in
practice
no
doubt
you
are
a
man
of
courage
but
i
am
sure
you
would
never
let
your
mistress
be
enjoyed
by
another
man
here
are
sequins
i
will
wager
that
amount
that
you
will
not
allow
me
to
sleep
with
your
wife
ha
ha
you
are
mistaken
in
me
i
assure
you
i
bet
fifty
sequins
that
i
will
remain
in
the
room
a
calm
spectator
of
your
exploits
my
dear
betty
we
must
punish
this
sceptic
go
to
bed
with
him
you
are
joking
not
at
all
to
bed
with
you
i
shall
love
you
all
the
more
you
must
be
crazy
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
the
count
took
her
in
his
arms
and
caressing
her
in
the
tenderest
manner
begged
her
to
do
him
this
favour
not
so
much
for
the
louis
as
to
convince
me
that
he
was
above
vulgar
prejudices
his
caresses
became
rather
free
but
betty
repulsed
him
gently
though
firmly
saying
that
she
would
never
consent
and
that
he
had
already
won
the
bet
which
was
the
case
in
fine
the
poor
girl
besought
him
to
kill
her
rather
than
oblige
her
to
do
a
deed
which
she
thought
infamous
her
words
and
the
pathetic
voice
with
which
they
were
uttered
should
have
shamed
him
but
they
only
put
him
into
a
furious
rage
he
repulsed
her
calling
her
the
vilest
names
and
finally
telling
her
that
she
was
a
hypocrite
and
he
felt
certain
she
had
already
granted
me
all
a
worthless
girl
could
grant
betty
grew
pale
as
death
and
furious
in
my
turn
i
ran
for
my
sword
i
should
probably
have
run
him
through
if
the
infamous
scoundrel
had
not
fled
into
the
next
room
where
he
locked
himself
in
i
was
in
despair
at
seeing
betty
distress
of
which
i
had
been
the
innocent
cause
and
i
did
my
best
to
soothe
her
she
was
in
an
alarming
state
her
breath
came
with
difficulty
her
eyes
seemed
ready
to
start
out
of
her
head
her
lips
were
bloodless
and
trembling
and
her
teeth
shut
tight
together
everyone
in
the
inn
was
asleep
i
could
not
call
for
help
and
all
i
could
do
was
to
dash
water
in
her
face
and
speak
soothing
words
at
last
she
fell
asleep
and
i
remained
beside
her
for
more
than
two
hours
attentive
to
her
least
movements
and
hoping
that
she
would
awake
strengthened
and
refreshed
at
i
heard
going
off
and
i
was
glad
of
it
the
people
of
the
inn
knocked
at
our
door
and
then
betty
awoke
are
you
ready
to
go
my
dear
betty
i
am
much
better
but
i
should
so
like
a
cup
of
tea
the
italians
can
not
make
tea
so
i
took
what
she
gave
me
and
went
to
prepare
it
myself
when
i
came
back
i
found
her
inhaling
the
fresh
morning
air
at
the
window
she
seemed
calm
and
i
hoped
i
had
cured
her
she
drank
a
few
cups
of
tea
of
which
beverage
the
english
are
very
fond
and
soon
regained
her
good
looks
she
heard
some
people
in
the
room
where
we
had
supped
and
asked
me
if
i
had
taken
up
the
purse
which
i
had
placed
on
the
table
i
had
forgotten
it
completely
i
found
my
purse
and
a
piece
of
paper
bearing
the
words
bill
of
exchange
for
three
thousand
crowns
the
impostor
had
taken
it
out
of
his
pocket
in
making
his
bet
and
had
forgotten
it
it
was
dated
at
bordeaux
drawn
on
a
wine
merchant
at
paris
to
order
it
was
payable
at
sight
and
was
for
six
months
the
whole
thing
was
utterly
irregular
i
took
it
to
betty
who
told
me
she
knew
nothing
about
bills
and
begged
me
to
say
nothing
more
about
that
infamous
fellow
she
then
said
in
a
voice
of
which
i
can
give
no
idea
for
pity
sake
do
not
abandon
a
poor
girl
more
worthy
of
compassion
than
blame
i
promised
her
again
to
have
all
a
father
care
for
her
and
soon
after
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
the
poor
girl
fell
asleep
and
i
followed
her
example
we
were
awoke
by
the
vetturino
who
informed
us
greatly
to
our
astonishment
that
we
were
at
monterosi
we
had
slept
for
six
hours
and
had
done
eighteen
miles
we
had
to
stay
at
monterosi
till
four
and
we
were
glad
of
it
for
we
needed
time
for
reflection
in
the
first
place
i
asked
about
the
wretched
deceiver
and
was
told
that
he
had
made
a
slight
meal
paid
for
it
and
said
he
was
going
to
spend
the
night
at
la
storta
we
made
a
good
dinner
and
betty
plucking
up
a
spirit
said
we
must
consider
the
case
of
her
infamous
betrayer
but
for
the
last
time
be
a
father
to
me
said
she
do
not
advise
but
command
you
may
reckon
on
my
obedience
i
have
no
need
to
give
you
any
further
particulars
for
you
have
guessed
all
except
the
horror
with
which
the
thought
of
my
betrayer
now
inspires
me
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
he
would
have
plunged
me
into
an
abyss
of
shame
and
misery
can
you
reckon
on
the
englishman
forgiving
you
i
think
so
then
we
must
go
back
to
leghorn
are
you
strong
enough
to
follow
this
counsel
i
warn
you
that
if
you
approve
of
it
it
must
be
put
into
execution
at
once
young
pretty
and
virtuous
as
you
are
you
need
not
imagine
that
i
shall
allow
you
to
go
by
yourself
or
in
the
company
of
strangers
if
you
think
i
love
you
and
find
me
worthy
of
your
esteem
that
is
sufficient
regard
for
me
i
will
live
with
you
like
a
father
if
you
are
not
in
a
position
to
give
me
marks
of
a
more
ardent
affection
be
sure
i
will
keep
faith
with
you
for
i
want
to
redeem
your
opinion
of
men
and
to
shew
you
that
there
are
men
as
honourable
as
your
seducer
was
vile
betty
remained
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
profound
silence
her
head
resting
on
her
elbows
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
mine
she
did
not
seem
either
angry
or
astonished
but
as
far
as
i
could
judge
was
lost
in
thought
i
was
glad
to
see
her
reflective
for
thus
she
would
be
able
to
give
me
a
decided
answer
at
last
she
said
you
need
not
think
my
dear
friend
that
my
silence
proceeds
from
irresolution
if
my
mind
were
not
made
up
already
i
should
despise
myself
i
am
wise
enough
at
any
rate
to
appreciate
the
wisdom
of
your
generous
counsels
i
thank
providence
that
i
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
such
a
man
who
will
treat
me
as
if
i
were
his
daughter
then
we
will
go
back
to
leghorn
and
start
immediately
my
only
doubt
is
how
to
manage
my
reconciliation
with
sir
b
m
i
have
no
doubt
he
will
pardon
me
eventually
but
though
he
is
tender
and
he
is
delicate
where
a
point
of
honour
is
concerned
and
subject
to
sudden
fits
of
violence
this
is
what
i
want
to
avoid
for
he
might
possibly
kill
me
and
then
i
should
be
the
cause
of
his
ruin
you
must
consider
it
on
the
way
and
tell
me
any
plans
you
may
think
of
he
is
an
intelligent
man
and
it
would
be
hopeless
to
endeavour
to
dupe
him
by
a
lie
i
must
make
a
full
confession
in
writing
without
hiding
a
single
circumstance
for
if
he
thought
he
was
being
duped
his
fury
would
be
terrible
if
you
will
write
to
him
you
must
not
say
that
you
think
me
worthy
of
forgiveness
you
must
tell
him
the
facts
and
leave
him
to
judge
for
himself
he
will
be
convinced
of
my
repentance
when
he
reads
the
letter
i
shall
bedew
with
my
tears
but
he
must
not
know
of
my
whereabouts
till
he
has
promised
to
forgive
me
he
is
a
slave
to
his
word
of
honour
and
we
shall
live
together
all
our
days
without
my
ever
hearing
of
this
slip
i
am
only
sorry
that
i
have
behaved
so
foolishly
you
must
not
be
offended
if
i
ask
you
whether
you
have
ever
given
him
like
cause
for
complaint
before
never
what
is
his
history
he
lived
very
unhappily
with
his
first
wife
and
he
was
divorced
from
his
second
wife
for
sufficient
reasons
two
years
ago
he
came
to
our
school
with
nancy
father
and
made
my
acquaintance
my
father
died
his
creditors
seized
everything
and
i
had
to
leave
the
school
much
to
nancy
distress
and
that
of
the
other
pupils
at
this
period
sir
b
m
took
charge
of
me
and
gave
me
a
sum
which
placed
me
beyond
the
reach
of
want
for
the
rest
of
my
days
i
was
grateful
and
begged
him
to
take
me
with
him
when
he
told
me
he
was
leaving
england
he
was
astonished
and
like
a
man
of
honour
said
he
loved
me
too
well
to
flatter
himself
that
we
could
travel
together
without
his
entertaining
more
ardent
feelings
for
me
than
those
of
a
father
he
thought
it
out
of
the
question
for
me
to
love
him
save
as
a
daughter
this
declaration
as
you
may
imagine
paved
the
way
for
a
full
agreement
you
love
me
i
said
shall
be
well
pleased
and
if
i
can
do
anything
for
you
i
shall
be
all
the
happier
he
then
gave
me
of
his
own
free
will
a
written
promise
to
marry
me
on
the
death
of
his
wife
we
started
on
our
travels
and
till
my
late
unhappy
connection
i
never
gave
him
the
slightest
cause
for
complaint
dry
your
eyes
dear
betty
he
is
sure
to
forgive
you
i
have
friends
at
leghorn
and
no
one
shall
find
out
that
we
have
made
acquaintance
i
will
put
you
in
good
hands
and
i
shall
not
leave
the
town
till
i
hear
you
are
back
with
sir
b
m
if
he
prove
inexorable
i
promise
never
to
abandon
you
and
to
take
you
back
to
england
if
you
like
but
how
can
you
spare
the
time
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
my
dear
betty
i
have
nothing
particular
to
do
at
rome
or
anywhere
else
london
and
rome
are
alike
to
me
how
can
i
shew
my
gratitude
to
you
i
summoned
the
vetturino
and
told
him
we
must
return
to
viterbo
he
objected
but
i
convinced
him
with
a
couple
of
piastres
and
by
agreeing
to
use
the
post
horses
and
to
spare
his
own
animals
we
got
to
viterbo
by
seven
and
asked
anxiously
if
no
one
had
found
a
which
i
pretended
i
had
lost
i
was
told
no
such
thing
had
been
found
so
i
ordered
supper
with
calmness
although
bewailing
my
loss
i
told
betty
that
i
acted
in
this
sort
to
obviate
any
difficulties
which
the
vetturino
might
make
about
taking
us
back
to
sienna
as
he
might
feel
it
his
duty
to
place
her
in
the
hands
of
her
supposed
husband
i
had
up
the
small
trunk
and
after
we
had
forced
the
lock
betty
took
out
her
cloak
and
the
few
effects
she
had
in
it
and
we
then
inspected
the
adventurer
properties
most
likely
all
he
possessed
in
the
world
a
few
tattered
shirts
two
or
three
pairs
of
mended
silk
stockings
a
pair
of
breeches
a
hare
foot
a
pot
of
grease
and
a
score
of
little
or
comic
operas
and
lastly
a
packet
of
letters
such
were
the
contents
of
the
trunk
we
proceeded
to
read
the
letters
and
the
first
thing
we
noted
was
the
address
to
actor
at
marseilles
bordeaux
bayonne
montpellier
etc
i
pitied
betty
she
saw
herself
the
dupe
of
a
vile
actor
and
her
indignation
and
shame
were
great
we
will
read
it
all
said
i
we
have
something
else
to
do
the
poor
girl
seemed
to
breathe
again
we
got
over
our
supper
hastily
and
then
betty
begged
me
to
leave
her
alone
for
a
few
moments
for
her
to
change
her
linen
and
go
to
bed
if
you
like
said
i
i
will
have
a
bed
made
up
for
me
in
the
next
room
no
dear
friend
ought
i
not
to
love
your
society
what
would
have
become
of
me
without
you
i
went
out
for
a
few
minutes
and
when
i
returned
and
came
to
her
bedside
to
wish
her
good
night
she
gave
me
such
a
warm
embrace
that
i
knew
my
hour
was
come
reader
you
must
take
the
rest
for
granted
i
was
happy
and
i
had
reason
to
believe
that
betty
was
happy
also
in
the
morning
we
had
just
fallen
asleep
when
the
vettuyino
knocked
at
the
door
i
dressed
myself
hastily
to
see
him
listen
i
said
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
me
to
recover
my
and
i
hope
to
find
it
at
acquapendente
very
good
sir
very
good
said
the
rogue
a
true
italian
pay
me
as
if
i
had
taken
you
to
rome
and
a
sequin
a
day
for
the
future
and
if
you
like
i
will
take
you
to
england
on
those
terms
the
vetturino
was
evidently
what
is
called
wide
awake
i
gave
him
his
money
and
we
made
a
new
agreement
at
seven
we
stopped
at
montefiascone
to
write
to
sir
b
m
she
in
english
and
i
in
french
betty
had
now
an
air
of
satisfaction
and
assurance
which
i
found
charming
she
said
she
was
full
of
hope
and
seemed
highly
amused
at
the
thought
of
the
figure
which
the
actor
would
cut
when
he
arrived
at
rome
by
himself
she
hoped
that
we
should
come
across
the
man
in
charge
of
her
trunk
and
that
we
should
have
no
difficulty
in
getting
it
back
he
might
pursue
us
he
dare
not
do
so
i
expect
not
but
if
he
does
i
will
give
him
a
warm
welcome
if
he
does
not
take
himself
off
i
will
blow
out
his
brains
before
i
began
my
letter
to
sir
b
m
betty
again
warned
me
to
conceal
nothing
from
him
not
even
the
reward
you
gave
me
oh
yes
that
is
a
little
secret
between
ourselves
in
less
than
three
hours
the
letters
were
composed
and
written
betty
was
satisfied
with
my
letter
and
her
own
which
she
translated
for
my
benefit
was
a
perfect
masterpiece
of
sensibility
which
seemed
to
me
certain
of
success
i
thought
of
posting
from
sienna
to
ensure
her
being
in
a
place
of
safety
before
the
arrival
of
her
lover
the
only
thing
that
troubled
me
was
the
bill
of
exchange
left
behind
by
for
whether
it
were
true
or
false
i
felt
bound
to
deal
with
it
in
some
way
but
i
could
not
see
how
it
was
to
be
done
we
set
out
again
after
dinner
in
spite
of
the
heat
and
arrived
at
acquapendente
in
the
evening
and
spent
the
night
in
the
delights
of
mutual
love
as
i
was
getting
up
in
the
morning
i
saw
a
carriage
in
front
of
the
inn
just
starting
for
rome
i
imagined
that
amidst
the
baggage
betty
trunk
might
be
discovered
and
i
told
her
to
get
up
and
see
if
it
were
there
we
went
down
and
betty
recognized
the
trunk
she
had
confided
to
her
seducer
we
begged
the
vetturino
to
restore
it
to
us
but
he
was
inflexible
and
as
he
was
in
the
right
we
had
to
submit
the
only
thing
he
could
do
was
to
have
an
embargo
laid
on
the
trunk
at
rome
the
said
embargo
to
last
for
a
month
a
notary
was
called
and
our
claim
properly
drawn
up
the
vetturino
who
seemed
an
honest
and
intelligent
fellow
assured
us
he
had
received
nothing
else
belonging
to
the
comte
de
so
we
were
assured
that
the
actor
was
a
mere
beggar
on
the
lookout
for
pickings
and
that
the
rags
in
the
small
trunk
were
all
his
possessions
after
this
business
had
been
dispatched
betty
brightened
up
amazingly
heaven
she
exclaimed
is
arranging
everything
my
mistake
will
serve
as
a
warning
to
me
for
the
future
for
the
lesson
has
been
a
severe
one
and
might
have
been
much
worse
if
i
had
not
had
the
good
fortune
of
meeting
you
i
congratulate
you
i
replied
on
having
cured
yourself
so
quickly
of
a
passion
that
had
deprived
you
of
your
reason
ah
a
woman
reason
is
a
fragile
thing
i
shudder
when
i
think
of
the
monster
but
i
verily
believe
that
i
should
not
have
regained
my
senses
if
he
had
not
called
me
a
hypocrite
and
said
that
he
was
certain
i
had
already
granted
you
my
favours
these
infamous
words
opened
my
eyes
and
made
me
see
my
shame
i
believe
i
would
have
helped
you
to
pierce
him
to
the
heart
if
the
coward
had
not
run
away
but
i
am
glad
he
did
run
away
not
for
his
sake
but
for
ours
for
we
should
have
been
in
an
unpleasant
position
if
he
had
been
killed
you
are
right
he
escaped
my
sword
because
he
is
destined
for
the
rope
let
him
look
to
that
himself
but
i
am
sure
he
will
never
dare
to
shew
his
face
before
you
or
me
again
we
reached
radicofani
at
ten
and
proceeded
to
write
postscripts
to
our
letters
to
sir
b
m
we
were
sitting
at
the
same
table
betty
opposite
to
the
door
and
i
close
to
it
so
that
anyone
coming
in
could
not
have
seen
me
without
turning
round
betty
was
dressed
with
all
decency
and
neatness
but
i
had
taken
off
my
coat
on
account
of
the
suffocating
heat
nevertheless
though
i
was
in
shirt
sleeves
i
should
not
have
been
ashamed
of
my
attire
before
the
most
respectable
woman
in
italy
all
at
once
i
heard
a
rapid
step
coming
along
the
passage
and
the
door
was
dashed
open
a
man
came
in
and
seeing
betty
cried
out
ah
there
you
are
i
did
not
give
him
time
to
turn
round
and
see
me
but
leapt
upon
him
and
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
if
i
had
not
done
so
he
would
have
shot
me
dead
on
the
spot
as
i
leapt
upon
him
i
had
involuntarily
closed
the
door
and
as
he
cried
let
me
go
traitor
betty
fell
on
her
knees
before
him
exclaiming
no
no
he
is
my
preserver
sir
b
m
was
too
mad
with
rage
to
pay
any
attention
to
her
and
kept
on
let
me
go
traitors
as
may
be
imagined
i
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
this
request
so
long
as
the
loaded
pistol
was
in
his
hand
in
our
struggles
he
at
last
fell
to
the
ground
and
i
on
top
of
him
the
landlord
and
his
people
had
heard
the
uproar
and
were
trying
to
get
in
but
as
we
had
fallen
against
the
door
they
could
not
do
so
betty
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
snatch
the
pistol
from
his
hand
and
i
then
let
him
go
calmly
observing
sir
you
are
labouring
under
a
delusion
again
betty
threw
herself
on
her
knees
begging
him
to
calm
himself
as
i
was
her
preserver
not
her
betrayer
what
do
you
mean
by
said
b
m
betty
gave
him
the
letter
saying
read
that
the
englishman
read
the
letter
through
without
rising
from
the
ground
and
as
i
was
certain
of
its
effect
i
opened
the
door
and
told
the
landlord
to
send
his
people
away
and
to
get
dinner
for
three
as
everything
had
been
settled
