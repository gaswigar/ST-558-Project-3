the

chapter
i
among
the
hills
there
were
three
at
the
newthorpe
his
daughter
annabel
and
their
visitor
annabel
cousin
miss
paula
tyrrell
it
was
a
small
low
room
the
walls
covered
with
etchings
and
and
with
photographs
which
were
doubtless
mementoes
of
travel
dwarf
bookcases
held
overflowings
from
the
library
volumes
in
disorder
clearly
more
for
use
than
ornament
the
casements
were
open
to
let
in
the
air
of
a
july
morning
between
the
thickets
of
the
garden
the
eye
caught
glimpses
of
lake
and
sheer
hillside
for
the
house
stood
on
the
shore
of
ullswater
of
the
three
breakfasting
miss
tyrrell
was
certainly
the
one
whose
presence
would
least
allow
itself
to
be
overlooked
her
appetite
was
hearty
but
it
scarcely
interfered
with
the
free
flow
of
her
airy
talk
which
was
independent
of
remark
or
reply
from
her
companions
though
it
was
not
apparent
in
her
demeanour
this
young
lady
was
suffering
under
a
calamity
her
second
had
been
ruined
at
its
very
culmination
by
a
ludicrous
in
the
shape
of
an
attack
of
measles
just
when
she
flattered
herself
that
she
had
never
looked
so
lovely
an
instrument
of
destiny
embraced
her
in
the
shape
of
an
affectionate
child
and
lo
she
was
a
fright
her
constitution
had
soon
thrown
off
the
evil
thing
but
tyrrell
decreed
her
banishment
for
a
time
to
the
remote
dwelling
of
her
literary
uncle
once
more
paula
was
lovely
and
yet
one
could
scarcely
say
that
the
worst
was
over
seeing
that
she
was
constrained
to
pass
summer
days
within
view
of
helvellyn
when
she
might
have
been
in
piccadilly
newthorpe
seldom
interrupted
his
niece
monologue
but
his
eye
often
rested
upon
her
seemingly
in
speculation
and
he
bent
his
head
acquiescingly
when
she
put
in
a
quick
you
think
so
after
a
running
series
of
comments
on
some
matter
which
smacked
exceedingly
of
the
town
he
was
not
more
than
yet
had
thin
grizzled
hair
and
a
sallow
face
with
lines
of
trouble
deeply
scored
upon
it
his
costume
was
very
careless
indeed
all
but
slovenly
and
his
attitude
in
the
chair
showed
if
not
weakness
of
body
at
all
events
physical
indolence
some
word
that
fell
from
paula
prompted
him
to
ask
wonder
where
egremont
is
annabel
who
had
been
sunk
in
thought
looked
up
with
a
smile
she
was
about
to
say
something
but
her
cousin
replied
rapidly
egremont
is
in
london
at
least
he
was
a
month
ago
much
of
a
guarantee
that
he
is
there
now
newthorpe
rejoined
drop
him
a
line
and
see
said
paula
meant
to
do
so
yesterday
but
forgot
i
write
and
tell
him
to
send
me
a
full
account
of
himself
is
it
too
bad
that
people
do
write
to
me
everybody
forgets
you
when
you
out
of
town
in
the
season
now
see
i
sha
have
a
single
letter
again
this
morning
it
is
the
cruellest
thing
you
had
a
letter
yesterday
paula
annabel
remarked
letter
oh
from
mamma
that
does
count
a
letter
is
a
letter
unless
you
feel
anxious
to
see
what
in
it
i
know
exactly
all
that
mamma
will
say
from
beginning
to
end
before
i
open
the
envelope
not
a
scrap
of
news
and
with
her
opportunities
too
but
i
can
count
on
egremont
for
at
least
four
sides
well
three
surely
he
is
not
a
source
of
news
said
her
uncle
with
surprise
not
he
can
be
very
jolly
when
he
likes
and
i
know
he
write
a
nice
letter
if
i
ask
him
to
you
ca
think
how
much
he
improved
just
lately
he
was
down
at
the
ditchleys
when
we
were
there
in
february
he
and
i
had
ever
such
a
time
one
day
when
the
others
were
out
hunting
mamma
wo
let
me
hunt
is
it
too
bad
of
her
he
did
speak
a
single
serious
word
all
the
morning
and
just
think
how
dry
he
used
to
be
of
course
he
can
be
dry
enough
still
when
he
gets
with
people
like
adams
and
clara
carr
but
i
hope
to
break
him
of
the
habit
entirely
she
glanced
at
annabel
and
laughed
merrily
before
raising
her
cup
to
her
lips
newthorpe
just
cast
a
rapid
eye
over
his
daughter
face
annabel
wore
a
look
of
quiet
amusement
he
been
here
since
then
paula
inquired
tapping
a
second
egg
lost
sight
of
him
for
two
or
three
months
and
of
course
he
always
makes
a
mystery
of
his
wanderings
saw
him
last
in
october
her
uncle
answered
he
had
just
returned
from
america
said
he
was
going
to
australia
next
what
his
address
something
russell
street
do
you
know
idea
he
replied
smiling
mind
i
send
the
letter
to
ormonde
she
always
knows
where
he
is
and
i
believe
she
the
only
one
that
does
when
the
meal
came
to
an
end
newthorpe
went
as
usual
to
his
study
miss
tyrrell
also
as
usual
prepared
for
three
hours
of
annabel
after
a
brief
consultation
with
martin
the
housekeeper
would
ordinarily
have
sat
down
to
study
in
the
morning
room
she
laid
open
a
book
on
the
table
but
then
lingered
between
that
and
the
windows
at
length
she
took
a
volume
of
a
lighter
kind
in
both
senses
and
finding
her
garden
hat
in
the
hall
went
forth
she
was
something
less
than
twenty
and
bore
herself
with
grace
perchance
a
little
too
sober
for
her
years
her
head
was
wont
to
droop
thoughtfully
and
her
step
measured
itself
to
the
grave
music
of
a
mind
which
knew
the
influence
of
mountain
solitude
but
her
health
was
complete
she
could
row
for
long
stretches
and
on
occasion
fatigued
her
father
in
rambles
over
moor
and
fell
face
and
figure
were
matched
in
mature
beauty
she
had
dark
hair
braided
above
the
forehead
on
each
side
and
large
dark
eyes
which
regarded
you
with
a
pure
intelligence
disconcerting
if
your
word
uttered
less
than
sincerity
when
her
mother
died
annabel
was
sixteen
three
months
after
that
event
newthorpe
left
london
for
his
country
house
which
neither
he
nor
his
daughter
had
since
quitted
he
had
views
of
his
own
on
the
subject
of
london
life
as
it
affects
young
ladies
by
nature
a
student
he
had
wedded
a
woman
who
became
something
not
far
removed
from
a
fashionable
beauty
it
was
a
passionate
attachment
on
both
sides
at
first
and
to
the
end
he
loved
his
wife
with
the
love
which
can
deny
nothing
the
consequence
was
that
the
years
of
his
prime
were
wasted
and
the
intellectual
promise
of
his
youth
found
no
fulfilment
another
year
and
annabel
would
have
entered
the
social
mill
she
had
beauty
enough
to
achieve
distinction
and
the
means
of
the
family
were
ample
to
enshrine
her
but
she
never
out
no
one
would
at
first
believe
that
newthorpe
retreat
was
final
no
one
save
a
close
friend
or
two
who
understood
what
his
life
had
been
and
how
he
dreaded
for
his
daughter
the
temptations
which
had
warped
her
mother
womanhood
any
case
wrote
tyrrell
his
when
a
year
and
a
half
had
gone
by
will
of
course
let
me
have
annabel
shortly
i
pray
you
to
remember
that
she
is
turned
seventeen
you
surely
wo
deprive
her
of
every
pleasure
and
every
advantage
and
the
recluse
made
answer
bolts
and
shackles
were
needful
i
would
use
them
mercilessly
rather
than
allow
my
girl
to
enter
your
middlesex
pandemonium
happily
the
fetters
of
her
reason
suffice
she
is
growing
into
a
woman
and
by
the
blessing
of
the
gods
her
soul
shall
be
blown
through
and
through
with
the
free
air
of
heaven
whilst
yet
the
elements
in
her
are
blending
to
their
final
shape
tyrrell
raised
her
eyebrows
and
shook
her
head
and
talked
sadly
of
annabel
who
was
buried
alive
she
walked
down
to
a
familiar
spot
by
the
lake
where
a
rustic
bench
was
set
under
shadowing
leafage
in
front
two
skiffs
were
moored
on
the
strand
the
sky
was
billowy
with
shapes
of
whiteness
a
warm
wind
broke
murmuring
wavelets
along
the
pebbly
margin
the
opposite
slopes
glassed
themselves
in
the
deep
dark
water
swarth
fell
hallin
fell
place
fell
one
after
the
other
above
the
southern
bend
of
the
lake
rose
noble
summits
softly
touched
with
mist
which
the
sun
was
fast
dispelling
the
sweetness
of
summer
was
in
the
air
so
quiet
was
it
that
every
in
the
brake
every
whisper
of
leaf
to
leaf
made
a
distinct
small
voice
a
barking
over
at
howtown
seemed
close
at
hand
this
morning
annabel
had
no
inclination
to
read
yet
her
face
was
not
expressive
of
the
calm
reflection
which
was
her
habit
she
opened
the
book
upon
her
lap
and
glanced
down
a
page
or
two
but
without
interest
at
length
external
things
were
wholly
lost
to
her
and
she
gazed
across
the
water
with
continuance
of
solemn
vision
her
face
was
almost
austere
in
this
mood
which
had
come
upon
her
someone
was
descending
the
path
which
led
from
the
high
road
it
was
a
step
too
heavy
for
paula
too
rapid
to
be
newthorpe
annabel
turned
her
head
and
saw
a
young
man
perhaps
of
dressed
in
a
light
with
a
small
wallet
hanging
from
his
shoulder
and
a
stick
in
his
hand
at
sight
of
her
he
took
off
his
cap
and
approached
her
saw
from
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
he
said
someone
was
sitting
here
and
i
came
down
on
the
chance
that
it
might
be
you
she
rose
with
a
very
slight
show
of
surprise
and
returned
his
greeting
with
calm
friendliness
were
speaking
of
you
at
breakfast
my
cousin
could
tell
us
for
certain
whether
you
were
in
england
though
she
knew
you
were
in
london
a
month
ago
tyrrell
is
with
you
he
asked
as
if
it
were
very
unexpected
did
you
know
she
has
been
ill
and
they
sent
her
to
us
to
recruit
i
have
been
in
jersey
for
a
month
i
have
heard
nothing
were
able
to
tear
yourself
from
london
in
when
was
i
a
devotee
of
the
season
miss
newthorpe
hear
you
progress
in
civilisation
i
hope
so
i
had
a
month
of
steady
reading
and
feel
better
for
it
i
took
a
big
chest
of
books
to
jersey
but
i
hope
miss
tyrrell
is
better
herself
again
shall
we
walk
up
to
the
house
have
broken
in
upon
your
reading
she
exhibited
the
volume
it
was
buskin
and
lilies
you
got
it
and
like
it
the
whole
is
disappointing
annabel
was
silent
then
spoke
of
another
matter
as
they
walked
up
from
the
lake
this
egremont
had
not
the
look
of
a
man
who
finds
his
joy
in
the
life
of
society
his
face
was
rather
bony
and
its
lines
expressed
independence
of
character
his
forehead
was
broad
his
eyes
glanced
quickly
and
searchingly
or
widened
themselves
into
an
absent
gazing
which
revealed
the
imaginative
temperament
his
habitual
cast
of
countenance
was
meditative
with
a
tendency
to
sadness
in
talk
he
readily
became
vivacious
his
short
sentences
delivered
with
a
very
clear
and
conciliating
enunciation
seemed
to
indicate
energy
it
was
a
peculiarity
that
he
very
rarely
smiled
or
perhaps
i
should
say
that
he
had
the
faculty
of
smiling
only
with
his
eyes
at
such
moments
his
look
was
very
winning
very
frank
in
its
appeal
to
sympathy
and
compelled
one
to
like
him
yet
at
another
time
his
aspect
could
be
shrewdly
critical
it
was
so
when
annabel
fell
short
of
enthusiasm
in
speaking
of
the
book
he
had
recommended
to
her
when
last
at
ullswater
probably
he
was
not
without
his
share
of
scepticism
for
all
that
it
was
the
visage
of
an
idealist
annabel
led
him
into
the
house
and
to
the
study
door
at
which
she
knocked
then
she
stood
aside
for
him
to
enter
before
her
newthorpe
was
writing
he
looked
up
absently
but
light
gathered
in
his
eyes
as
he
recognised
the
visitor
here
you
are
we
talked
of
you
this
morning
how
have
you
come
foot
from
pooley
bridge
they
clasped
hands
then
egremont
looked
behind
him
but
annabel
had
closed
the
door
and
was
gone
she
went
up
to
the
room
in
which
paula
sat
scribbling
letters
minutes
more
exclaimed
that
young
lady
just
finishing
a
note
to
mamma
so
dutiful
you
written
to
mr
egremont
paula
nodded
and
laughed
is
downstairs
paula
started
looking
incredulous
bell
has
just
walked
over
from
pooley
bridge
bell
do
tell
me
have
those
horrid
measles
left
any
trace
i
really
ca
discover
any
but
of
course
one
has
good
eyes
for
own
little
speckles
well
at
all
events
everybody
has
forgotten
me
but
do
look
at
me
bell
her
cousin
regarded
her
with
conscientious
gravity
see
no
trace
whatever
indeed
i
should
say
you
are
looking
better
than
you
ever
did
that
awfully
kind
of
you
and
you
do
pay
compliments
either
shall
i
go
down
did
you
tell
him
where
i
was
had
annabel
been
disposed
to
dainty
feminine
malice
here
was
an
opportunity
indeed
but
she
looked
at
paula
with
simple
curiosity
seeming
for
a
moment
to
lose
herself
the
other
had
to
repeat
her
question
mentioned
that
you
were
in
the
house
she
replied
is
talking
with
father
paula
moved
to
the
door
but
suddenly
paused
and
turned
i
wonder
what
thought
you
have
in
your
serious
head
she
said
merrily
only
my
fun
you
know
annabel
nodded
smiling
it
is
only
my
fun
say
you
believe
me
i
shall
be
cross
with
you
if
you
put
on
that
look
they
went
into
the
morning
room
annabel
stood
at
the
window
her
companion
flitted
about
catching
glimpses
of
herself
in
reflecting
surfaces
in
five
minutes
the
study
door
opened
and
men
voices
drew
near
egremont
met
miss
tyrrell
with
the
manner
of
an
old
acquaintance
but
unsmiling
am
fortunate
enough
to
see
you
well
again
without
having
known
of
your
illness
he
said
did
know
that
i
was
ill
paula
looked
at
him
dubiously
he
explained
and
in
doing
so
quite
dispelled
the
girl
illusion
that
he
was
come
on
her
account
when
she
remained
silent
he
said
must
pity
the
people
in
london
i
do
i
learning
to
keep
my
temper
and
to
talk
wisely
i
know
nobody
in
london
who
could
teach
me
to
do
either
the
one
or
the
other
i
suppose
you
go
out
till
said
newthorpe
wants
to
have
a
pull
you
excuse
an
old
man
they
left
the
house
and
for
an
hour
drank
the
breath
of
the
hillsides
paula
was
at
first
taciturn
very
unlike
herself
she
dabbled
her
fingers
over
the
and
any
light
remark
that
she
made
was
addressed
to
her
cousin
annabel
exerted
herself
to
converse
chiefly
telling
of
the
excursions
that
had
been
made
with
paula
during
the
past
week
have
you
been
doing
in
jersey
paula
asked
of
egremont
presently
her
tone
was
indifferent
a
little
condescending
where
are
you
going
next
shall
live
in
london
my
travels
are
over
i
think
have
heard
that
too
often
said
annabel
you
ever
calculate
how
many
miles
you
have
travelled
since
you
left
oxford
have
been
a
restless
fellow
he
admitted
regarding
her
with
quiet
scrutiny
i
dare
say
some
profit
has
come
of
my
wanderings
however
it
time
to
set
to
work
asked
paula
in
surprise
sort
of
work
preacher
paula
moved
her
lips
discontentedly
is
your
way
of
telling
me
to
mind
my
own
business
do
you
find
the
sun
dreadfully
hot
annabel
do
please
row
into
a
shady
place
mr
egremont
his
way
of
handling
the
oars
showed
that
he
was
no
stranger
to
exercise
of
this
kind
his
frame
though
a
trifle
meagre
was
well
set
by
degrees
a
preoccupation
which
had
been
manifest
in
him
gave
way
under
the
influence
of
the
sky
and
when
it
was
time
to
approach
the
he
had
fallen
into
a
mood
of
cheerful
talk
light
with
paula
with
annabel
more
earnest
his
eyes
often
passed
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
faces
opposite
him
with
unmarked
observation
frequently
he
fixed
his
gaze
on
the
remoter
hills
in
brief
musing
newthorpe
had
come
down
to
the
water
to
meet
them
he
had
a
newspaper
in
his
hand
friend
dalmaine
is
eloquent
on
education
he
said
with
a
humorous
twitching
of
the
eyebrows
he
knows
his
house
egremont
replied
observe
the
construction
of
his
speech
after
periods
on
the
elevation
of
the
working
classes
he
casually
throws
out
the
hint
that
employers
of
labour
will
do
wisely
to
increase
the
intelligence
of
their
hands
in
view
of
foreign
competition
of
course
that
is
the
root
of
the
matter
but
dalmaine
knows
better
than
to
begin
with
crude
truths
in
the
meanwhile
the
boat
was
drawn
up
and
the
chain
locked
the
girls
walked
on
in
advance
egremont
continued
to
speak
of
dalmaine
a
rising
politician
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
on
the
voyage
home
from
new
york
of
the
few
sincere
things
i
ever
heard
from
his
lips
was
a
remark
he
made
on
let
them
combine
by
all
means
he
said
it
a
fair
fight
there
you
have
the
man
it
seems
to
him
mere
common
sense
to
regard
his
factory
hands
as
his
enemies
a
fair
fight
what
a
idea
of
fairness
he
spoke
with
scorn
his
eyes
flashing
and
his
nostrils
trembling
newthorpe
kept
a
quiet
smile
sympathetic
yet
critical
annabel
sought
her
father
for
a
word
apart
before
lunch
long
will
egremont
stay
she
asked
apparently
speaking
in
her
quality
of
day
or
two
was
the
reply
drive
over
to
pooley
bridge
for
his
bag
this
afternoon
he
left
it
at
the
hotel
has
he
on
his
mind
she
continued
smiling
idealistic
project
he
has
only
given
me
a
hint
i
dare
say
we
shall
hear
all
about
it
chapter
ii
the
idealist
when
egremont
began
his
acquaintance
with
the
newthorpes
he
was
an
oxford
undergraduate
a
close
friendship
had
sprung
up
between
him
and
a
young
man
named
ormonde
and
at
the
latter
home
he
met
newthorpe
who
from
the
first
regarded
him
with
interest
a
year
after
newthorpe
death
egremont
was
invited
to
visit
the
house
at
ullswater
since
then
he
had
twice
spent
a
week
there
this
personal
intercourse
was
slight
to
have
resulted
in
so
much
intimacy
but
he
had
kept
up
a
frequent
correspondence
with
newthorpe
from
various
parts
of
the
world
and
common
friends
aided
the
stability
of
the
relation
he
was
the
only
son
of
a
man
who
had
made
a
fortune
by
the
manufacture
of
his
father
began
life
as
a
then
became
an
oil
merchant
in
a
small
way
and
at
length
married
a
daughter
who
brought
him
a
moderate
capital
just
when
he
needed
it
for
an
enterprise
promising
greatly
in
a
short
time
he
had
established
the
firm
of
egremont
pollard
with
extensive
works
in
lambeth
his
wife
died
before
him
his
son
received
a
liberal
education
and
in
early
manhood
found
himself
as
far
as
he
knew
without
a
living
relative
but
with
ample
means
of
independence
young
walter
egremont
retained
an
interest
in
the
business
but
had
no
intention
of
devoting
himself
to
a
commercial
life
at
the
university
he
had
made
alliances
with
men
of
standing
in
the
academical
sense
and
likewise
with
some
whose
place
in
the
world
relieved
them
from
the
necessity
of
establishing
a
claim
to
intellect
in
this
way
society
was
opened
to
him
and
his
personal
qualities
won
for
him
a
great
measure
of
regard
from
those
whom
he
most
desired
to
please
somebody
had
called
him
idealist
and
the
name
adhered
to
him
at
he
published
a
volume
of
poems
obviously
derived
from
study
of
shelley
but
marked
with
a
certain
freshness
of
impersonal
aspiration
which
was
pleasant
enough
they
had
the
note
of
sincerity
rather
than
the
true
poetical
promise
the
book
had
no
successor
having
found
this
utterance
for
his
fervour
egremont
began
a
series
of
ramblings
over
sea
in
search
he
said
of
himself
the
object
seemed
to
evade
him
he
returned
to
england
from
time
to
time
always
in
appearance
more
restless
but
always
overflowing
with
ideas
for
which
he
had
the
readiest
store
of
enthusiastic
words
he
was
able
to
talk
of
himself
without
conveying
the
least
impression
of
egotism
to
those
who
were
in
sympathy
with
his
intellectual
point
of
view
he
was
accused
of
conceit
only
by
a
few
who
were
jealous
of
him
or
were
too
conventional
to
appreciate
his
character
with
women
he
was
a
favourite
and
their
society
was
his
greatest
pleasure
yet
in
spite
of
his
fervid
temperament
in
appearance
fervid
at
all
events
he
never
seemed
to
fall
in
love
some
there
were
who
said
that
the
self
he
went
so
far
to
discover
would
prove
to
have
a
female
form
perhaps
there
was
truth
in
this
perhaps
he
sought
whether
consciously
or
no
the
ideal
woman
none
of
those
with
whom
he
companioned
had
a
charge
of
light
wooing
to
bring
against
him
though
one
or
two
would
not
have
held
it
a
misfortune
if
they
had
tempted
him
to
forget
his
speculations
and
declare
that
he
had
reached
his
goal
but
his
striving
always
seemed
to
be
for
something
remote
from
the
world
about
him
his
capacity
for
warm
feeling
itself
undeniable
was
never
dissociated
from
that
impersonal
zeal
which
was
the
characteristic
of
his
expressions
in
verse
in
fact
he
had
written
no
annabel
and
her
father
observed
a
change
in
him
since
his
last
visit
this
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
come
without
an
express
invitation
and
they
gathered
from
his
speech
that
he
had
at
length
found
some
definite
object
for
his
energies
his
friends
had
for
a
long
time
been
asking
what
he
meant
to
do
with
his
life
it
did
not
appear
that
he
purposed
literary
effort
though
it
seemed
the
natural
outlet
for
his
eager
thought
and
of
the
career
of
politics
he
at
all
times
spoke
with
contempt
was
he
one
of
the
men
never
so
common
as
nowadays
who
spend
their
existence
in
canvassing
the
possibilities
that
lie
before
them
and
delay
action
till
they
find
that
the
will
is
paralysed
one
did
not
readily
set
egremont
in
that
class
principally
no
doubt
because
he
was
so
free
from
the
offensive
forms
of
which
are
wont
to
stamp
such
men
the
pity
of
it
too
if
talents
like
his
were
suffered
to
rust
unused
the
very
genuineness
of
his
idealism
made
one
believe
in
him
and
look
with
confidence
to
his
future
having
dined
all
went
forth
to
enjoy
the
evening
upon
the
lawn
the
men
smoked
annabel
had
her
little
table
with
tea
and
coffee
paula
had
brought
out
a
magazine
and
affected
to
read
annabel
noticed
however
that
a
page
was
very
seldom
turned
you
seen
ormonde
lately
newthorpe
asked
of
egremont
spent
a
day
at
eastbourne
before
going
to
jersey
has
promised
to
come
to
us
in
the
autumn
said
annabel
she
seems
to
have
such
a
difficulty
in
leaving
her
home
had
she
many
children
about
her
when
you
were
there
or
twelve
they
all
come
from
london
asked
annabel
she
has
relations
with
sundry
hospitals
and
the
like
she
told
me
one
remarkable
story
a
short
time
ago
out
of
eight
children
that
were
in
the
house
only
one
could
read
a
little
girl
of
ten
and
this
one
regularly
received
letters
from
home
now
there
came
for
her
what
seemed
to
be
a
small
or
something
of
the
kind
in
a
wrapper
ormonde
gave
it
her
without
asking
any
questions
and
in
the
course
of
the
morning
happening
to
see
her
reading
it
she
went
to
look
what
the
paper
was
it
proved
to
be
an
periodical
and
on
the
front
page
stood
a
woodcut
offered
as
a
burlesque
illustration
of
some
biblical
incident
father
always
brings
it
home
and
gives
it
me
to
read
said
the
child
it
makes
me
laugh
she
knew
nothing
of
the
real
meaning
of
it
all
said
newthorpe
the
contrary
she
understood
the
tendency
of
the
paper
surprisingly
well
her
father
had
explained
everything
to
the
family
of
the
interesting
results
of
popular
education
remarked
newthorpe
philosophically
is
inevitable
did
ormonde
do
annabel
asked
was
a
difficult
point
no
good
would
have
been
done
by
endeavouring
to
set
the
child
against
her
father
she
would
be
home
again
in
a
fortnight
so
ormonde
simply
asked
if
she
might
have
the
paper
when
it
was
done
with
and
having
got
possession
threw
it
into
the
fire
with
vast
satisfaction
happily
it
did
come
again
a
gross
being
that
father
must
be
annabel
exclaimed
enough
egremont
replied
i
should
wonder
if
he
had
brains
above
the
average
in
his
class
a
mere
brute
would
do
a
thing
of
that
kind
ten
to
one
he
honestly
believed
that
he
was
benefiting
the
girl
educating
her
out
of
superstition
why
should
the
poor
people
be
left
to
such
teachers
annabel
exclaimed
those
influences
may
be
opposed
doubt
whether
they
can
be
said
her
father
one
insuperable
difficulty
lies
in
the
fact
that
we
have
no
power
greater
than
commercial
enterprise
nowadays
nothing
will
succeed
save
on
the
commercial
basis
from
church
to
the
principle
applies
there
is
no
way
of
spreading
popular
literature
save
on
terms
of
supply
and
demand
take
the
education
act
it
was
devised
and
carried
simply
for
the
reason
indicated
by
egremont
friend
dalmaine
a
more
intelligent
type
of
workmen
is
demanded
that
our
manufacturers
may
keep
pace
with
those
of
other
countries
well
there
is
a
demand
for
comic
illustrations
of
the
bible
and
the
demand
is
met
the
paper
exists
because
it
pays
an
organ
of
culture
for
the
people
who
enjoy
burlesquing
the
bible
could
possibly
be
made
to
pay
is
there
no
one
who
would
undertake
such
work
without
hope
of
recompense
in
money
we
are
not
all
mere
tradespeople
have
an
idea
for
a
beginning
of
such
work
miss
newthorpe
said
egremont
in
a
voice
rather
lower
than
hitherto
came
here
because
i
wanted
to
talk
it
over
annabel
met
his
look
for
a
moment
expressing
all
the
friendly
interest
which
she
felt
newthorpe
who
had
been
pacing
on
the
grass
came
to
a
seat
he
placed
himself
next
to
paula
she
glanced
at
him
and
he
said
kindly
are
quite
sure
you
do
feel
cold
dare
say
i
better
go
in
she
replied
checking
a
little
sigh
as
she
closed
her
magazine
no
do
go
paula
urged
her
cousin
rising
shall
have
a
shawl
dear
i
get
it
is
very
warm
put
in
egremont
surely
ca
be
any
danger
in
sitting
till
it
grows
dark
this
little
fuss
about
her
soothed
paula
for
a
while
i
do
want
to
go
she
said
feel
i
getting
very
serious
and
wise
listening
to
such
talk
now
we
shall
hear
i
suppose
what
you
mean
by
your
local
preacher
annabel
brought
a
shawl
and
placed
it
carefully
about
the
shoulders
then
she
said
to
her
father
me
sit
next
to
paula
please
the
change
of
seats
was
effected
annabel
secretly
took
one
of
her
cousin
hands
and
held
it
paula
seemed
to
regard
a
distant
object
in
the
garden
there
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
the
evening
was
profoundly
calm
a
spirit
of
solemn
loveliness
brooded
upon
the
hills
glorious
with
sunset
the
gnats
hummed
rising
and
falling
in
myriad
crowds
about
the
motionless
leaves
a
spring
which
fell
from
a
rock
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
babbled
poetry
of
the
twilight
hope
it
is
something
very
practicable
annabel
resumed
looking
with
expectancy
at
egremont
will
have
your
opinion
on
that
i
believe
it
to
be
practical
enough
at
all
events
it
is
a
scheme
of
very
modest
dimensions
that
story
of
the
child
and
her
paper
fixed
certain
thoughts
that
had
been
floating
about
in
my
mind
you
know
that
i
have
long
enough
tried
to
find
work
but
i
have
been
misled
by
the
common
tendency
of
the
time
those
who
want
to
be
of
social
usefulness
for
the
most
part
attack
the
lowest
stratum
it
seems
like
going
to
the
heart
of
the
problem
of
course
and
any
one
who
has
means
finds
there
the
hope
of
readiest
result
material
result
but
i
think
that
the
really
practical
task
is
the
most
neglected
just
because
it
does
not
appear
so
pressing
with
the
mud
at
the
bottom
of
society
we
can
practically
do
nothing
only
the
vast
changes
to
be
wrought
by
time
will
cleanse
that
foulness
by
destroying
the
monstrous
wrong
which
produces
it
what
i
should
like
to
attempt
would
be
the
spiritual
education
of
the
upper
artisan
and
mechanic
class
at
present
they
are
all
but
wholly
in
the
hands
of
men
who
can
do
them
nothing
but
harm
journalists
socialists
vulgar
propagators
of
what
is
called
freethought
these
all
work
against
culture
yet
here
is
the
field
really
waiting
for
the
right
tillage
i
often
have
in
mind
one
or
two
of
the
men
at
our
factory
in
lambeth
they
are
and
intelligent
fellows
but
save
for
a
vague
curiosity
i
should
say
they
live
without
conscious
aim
beyond
that
of
keeping
their
families
in
comfort
they
have
no
religion
a
matter
of
course
they
talk
incessantly
of
politics
knowing
nothing
better
but
they
are
very
far
above
the
gross
multitude
i
believe
such
men
as
these
have
a
great
part
to
play
in
social
development
that
in
fact
may
become
the
great
social
reformers
working
on
those
above
them
the
froth
of
society
no
less
than
on
those
below
he
had
laid
down
his
cigar
and
having
begun
in
a
scrupulously
moderate
tone
insensibly
warmed
to
the
idealist
fervour
his
face
became
more
mobile
his
eyes
gave
forth
all
their
light
his
voice
was
musically
modulated
as
he
proceeded
in
his
demonstration
he
addressed
himself
to
annabel
perhaps
unconscious
of
doing
so
exclusively
newthorpe
muttered
something
of
assent
paula
was
listening
intently
but
as
one
who
hears
of
strange
things
very
difficult
of
realisation
suppose
one
took
a
handful
of
such
typical
men
egremont
went
on
tried
to
inspire
them
with
a
moral
ideal
at
present
they
have
nothing
of
the
kind
but
they
own
the
instincts
of
decency
and
that
is
much
i
would
make
use
of
the
tendency
to
association
which
is
so
strong
among
them
they
have
numberless
benefit
clubs
they
stand
together
resolutely
to
help
each
other
in
time
of
need
and
to
exact
terms
from
their
employers
the
fair
fight
as
the
worthy
member
for
vauxhall
calls
it
well
why
should
they
band
for
moral
and
intellectual
purposes
i
would
have
a
sort
of
freemasonry
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
eating
and
drinking
or
with
the
dispensing
of
charity
it
should
be
wholly
concerned
with
spiritual
advancement
these
men
can
not
become
rich
and
so
are
free
from
one
kind
of
danger
they
are
not
likely
to
fall
into
privation
they
have
a
certain
amount
of
leisure
if
one
could
only
stir
a
few
of
them
to
enthusiasm
for
an
ideal
of
life
suppose
one
could
teach
them
to
feel
the
purpose
of
such
a
book
as
sesame
and
lilies
which
you
only
moderately
care
for
miss
newthorpe
so
annabel
broke
in
involuntarily
think
it
very
beautiful
and
very
noble
book
is
that
asked
paula
with
curiosity
give
it
to
you
to
read
paula
her
cousin
replied
egremont
continued
work
of
people
who
labour
in
the
abominable
quarters
of
the
town
would
be
absurdly
insignificant
in
comparison
with
what
these
men
might
do
the
vulgar
influence
of
revolutionists
social
and
religious
might
be
counteracted
an
incalculable
change
for
good
might
be
made
on
the
borders
of
the
social
inferno
and
would
spread
but
it
can
only
be
done
by
personal
influence
the
man
must
have
an
ideal
himself
before
he
can
create
it
in
others
i
do
know
that
i
am
strong
enough
for
such
an
undertaking
but
i
feel
the
desire
to
try
and
i
mean
to
try
what
do
you
think
of
it
it
so
clearly
must
be
half
doing
it
said
annabel
egremont
replied
to
her
with
a
clear
regard
the
details
newthorpe
remarked
you
going
to
make
lambeth
your
field
lambeth
i
have
a
natural
connection
with
the
place
and
my
name
may
be
of
some
service
to
me
there
i
do
think
it
is
of
evil
odour
with
the
workmen
my
project
is
to
begin
with
lectures
reserve
your
judgment
i
have
no
intention
of
standing
forth
as
an
apostle
all
i
mean
to
do
at
first
is
to
offer
a
free
course
of
lectures
on
a
period
of
english
literature
i
shall
not
throw
open
my
doors
to
all
and
sundry
but
specially
invite
a
certain
small
number
of
men
whom
i
shall
be
at
some
pains
to
choose
we
have
at
the
works
a
foreman
named
bower
i
have
known
him
in
a
way
for
years
and
i
believe
he
is
an
intelligent
man
him
i
shall
make
use
of
telling
him
nothing
of
my
wider
aims
but
simply
getting
him
to
discover
for
me
the
dozen
or
so
of
men
who
would
be
likely
to
care
for
my
lectures
the
man
of
whom
i
was
speaking
the
father
of
ormonde
patient
lives
in
lambeth
i
shall
certainly
make
an
effort
to
draw
him
into
the
net
shall
be
curious
to
hear
more
of
him
said
newthorpe
you
use
english
literature
to
tune
the
minds
of
your
hearers
is
my
thought
i
have
spent
my
month
in
jersey
in
preparing
a
couple
of
introductory
lectures
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
can
get
them
to
understand
what
is
meant
by
love
of
literature
pure
and
simple
without
a
thought
of
political
or
social
purpose
especially
without
a
thought
of
cash
profit
which
is
so
disastrously
blended
with
what
little
knowledge
they
acquire
i
shall
be
on
the
way
to
founding
my
club
of
social
reformers
i
shall
be
most
careful
not
to
alarm
them
with
hints
that
i
mean
more
than
i
say
here
arc
certain
interesting
english
books
let
us
see
what
they
are
about
who
wrote
them
and
why
they
are
deemed
excellent
that
is
our
position
these
men
must
get
on
a
friendly
footing
with
me
little
by
little
i
shall
talk
with
them
more
familiarly
try
to
understand
each
one
success
depends
upon
my
personal
influence
i
may
find
that
it
is
inadequate
yet
i
have
hope
naturally
i
have
points
of
contact
with
the
working
class
which
are
lacking
to
most
educated
men
a
little
chance
and
i
should
myself
have
been
a
mechanic
or
something
of
the
kind
this
may
make
itself
felt
i
believe
it
will
night
was
falling
the
last
hue
of
sunset
had
died
from
the
swarth
hills
and
in
the
east
were
pale
points
of
starlight
think
you
and
i
must
go
in
paula
said
annabel
when
there
had
been
silence
for
a
little
paula
rose
without
speaking
but
as
she
was
about
to
enter
the
house
she
turned
back
and
said
to
egremont
get
tired
so
soon
being
so
much
in
the
open
air
i
better
say
her
uncle
when
he
held
her
hand
stroked
it
affectionately
he
often
laughed
at
the
child
manifold
follies
but
her
prettiness
and
the
which
sweetened
her
inbred
artificiality
had
won
his
liking
much
as
it
would
have
astonished
paula
had
she
known
it
his
feeling
was
for
the
most
part
one
of
pity
suppose
you
go
out
again
paula
said
to
her
cousin
as
they
entered
the
i
shall
read
a
little
and
then
go
to
bed
she
added
with
a
laugh
will
sit
late
in
the
study
no
doubt
with
their
cigars
and
steaming
glasses
paula
moved
restlessly
about
the
room
for
a
few
minutes
then
from
the
door
she
gave
a
and
disappeared
without
further
ceremony
the
two
men
came
in
very
shortly
egremont
entered
the
alone
and
began
to
turn
over
books
on
the
table
then
annabel
rose
promises
for
another
fine
day
she
said
must
get
father
away
for
a
ramble
do
you
think
he
looks
well
than
he
did
last
autumn
i
think
must
go
and
say
to
him
will
you
come
to
the
study
he
followed
in
silence
and
annabel
took
her
leave
of
both
the
morning
broke
clear
it
was
decided
to
spend
the
greater
part
of
the
day
on
the
hills
paula
rode
the
others
drove
to
a
point
whence
their
ramble
was
to
begin
annabel
enjoyed
walking
very
soon
her
being
seemed
to
set
itself
to
more
spirited
music
the
veil
of
reflection
fell
from
her
face
and
she
began
to
talk
paula
behaved
with
singularity
at
breakfast
she
had
been
very
silent
a
most
unusual
thing
and
during
the
day
she
kept
an
air
of
reserve
a
sort
of
dignity
which
was
amusing
newthorpe
walked
beside
her
pony
and
adapted
himself
to
her
favourite
conversation
which
was
always
of
the
town
and
society
once
annabel
came
up
with
a
spray
of
mountain
saxifrage
it
lovely
paula
she
said
look
at
the
petals
nice
was
the
reply
it
too
small
to
be
of
any
use
there
was
no
more
talk
of
egremont
projects
books
and
friends
and
the
delights
of
the
upland
scenery
gave
matter
enough
for
conversation
not
long
after
noon
the
sky
began
to
cloud
and
almost
as
soon
as
the
party
reached
home
again
there
was
beginning
of
rain
they
spent
the
evening
in
the
paula
was
persuaded
to
sing
which
she
did
prettily
though
still
without
her
native
vivacity
again
she
retired
early
after
breakfast
on
the
morrow
it
still
rained
though
not
without
promise
of
clearing
excuse
me
till
lunch
paula
said
to
annabel
and
egremont
when
they
rose
from
the
table
have
a
great
deal
of
correspondence
to
see
to
was
a
new
word
usually
she
said
have
an
awful
heap
of
letters
to
write
her
dignity
of
the
former
day
was
still
preserved
having
dismissed
her
household
duties
annabel
went
to
the
morning
room
and
sat
down
to
her
books
she
was
reading
virgil
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
cost
her
a
repetition
of
efforts
to
fix
her
attention
but
her
resolve
was
at
length
successful
then
egremont
came
in
i
disturb
you
he
said
noticing
her
studious
attitude
can
give
me
a
little
help
if
you
will
i
ca
make
out
that
line
she
gave
him
one
copy
and
herself
opened
another
it
led
to
their
reading
some
fifty
lines
together
why
have
we
girls
to
get
our
knowledge
so
late
and
with
such
labour
annabel
exclaimed
at
length
learn
greek
and
latin
when
you
are
children
it
ought
to
be
the
same
with
us
i
am
impatient
i
want
to
read
straight
on
very
soon
will
he
replied
absently
then
having
glanced
at
the
windows
which
were
suddenly
illumined
with
a
broad
slant
of
sunlight
he
asked
you
come
out
it
will
be
delightful
after
the
rain
annabel
was
humming
over
dactylics
she
put
her
book
aside
with
reluctance
go
and
ask
my
cousin
egremont
averted
his
face
annabel
went
up
to
paula
room
knocked
and
entered
from
a
bustling
sound
within
it
appeared
likely
that
miss
tyrrell
attitude
at
the
table
had
been
suddenly
assumed
you
come
out
paula
the
rain
is
over
and
gone
now
egremont
wishes
to
go
for
a
walk
could
you
come
beg
egremont
to
excuse
me
i
am
tired
after
yesterday
dear
when
her
cousin
had
withdrawn
paula
went
to
the
window
in
a
few
minutes
she
saw
egremont
and
annabel
go
forth
and
stroll
from
the
garden
towards
the
lake
then
she
reseated
herself
and
sat
biting
her
pen
the
two
walked
lingeringly
by
the
water
edge
they
spoke
of
trifles
when
they
were
some
distance
from
the
house
egremont
said
you
see
i
have
at
last
found
my
work
if
you
thought
of
me
at
all
i
dare
say
my
life
seemed
to
you
a
very
useless
one
and
little
likely
to
lead
to
anything
i
had
not
that
thought
egremont
she
answered
simply
felt
sure
that
you
were
preparing
yourself
for
something
worthy
hope
that
is
the
meaning
of
these
years
that
have
gone
so
quickly
but
it
was
not
conscious
preparation
it
has
often
seemed
to
me
that
in
travelling
and
gaining
experience
i
was
doing
all
that
life
demanded
of
me
few
men
can
be
more
disposed
to
idle
dreaming
than
i
am
and
even
now
i
keep
asking
myself
whether
this
too
is
only
a
moment
of
idealism
which
will
go
by
and
leave
me
with
less
practical
energy
than
ever
every
such
project
undertaken
and
abandoned
is
a
weight
upon
a
man
will
if
i
fail
in
perseverance
my
fate
will
be
decided
feel
assured
that
you
will
not
fail
you
could
not
speak
as
you
did
last
night
and
yet
allow
yourself
to
falter
in
purpose
when
the
task
was
once
begun
what
success
may
await
you
we
can
not
say
the
work
will
certainly
be
very
difficult
will
it
not
ask
a
lifetime
less
if
it
is
to
have
any
lasting
result
glad
then
what
happier
thing
can
befall
one
than
to
have
life
consecrated
to
a
worthy
end
he
walked
on
in
silence
then
regarded
her
words
in
such
a
voice
would
make
any
man
strong
yet
i
would
ask
more
from
you
there
is
one
thing
i
need
to
feel
full
confidence
in
myself
and
that
is
a
woman
love
i
have
known
for
a
long
time
whose
love
it
was
that
i
must
try
to
win
can
you
give
me
what
i
ask
the
smile
which
touched
his
lips
so
seldom
was
on
them
now
he
showed
no
agitation
but
the
light
of
his
eyes
was
very
vivid
as
they
read
her
expression
annabel
had
stayed
her
steps
for
a
moment
she
looked
troubled
his
words
were
not
unanticipated
but
the
answer
with
which
she
was
prepared
was
more
difficult
to
utter
than
she
had
thought
it
would
be
it
was
the
first
time
that
a
man
had
spoken
to
her
thus
and
though
in
theory
such
a
situation
had
always
seemed
to
her
very
simple
she
could
not
now
preserve
her
calm
as
she
wished
she
felt
the
warmth
of
her
blood
and
could
not
at
once
command
her
wonted
voice
but
when
at
length
she
succeeded
in
meeting
his
look
steadily
her
thought
grew
clear
again
can
not
give
you
that
mr
egremont
as
his
eyes
fell
she
hastened
to
add
think
of
you
often
i
feel
glad
to
know
you
and
to
share
in
your
interest
but
this
is
no
more
than
the
friendship
which
many
people
have
for
you
quite
different
from
the
feeling
which
you
say
would
aid
you
i
have
never
known
that
he
was
gazing
across
the
lake
the
melancholy
always
lurking
in
the
thoughtfulness
of
his
face
had
become
predominant
yet
he
turned
to
her
with
the
smile
once
more
last
words
must
be
my
hope
to
have
your
friendship
is
much
perhaps
some
day
i
may
win
more
think
she
said
with
a
sincerity
which
proved
how
far
she
was
from
emotion
you
will
meet
another
woman
whose
sympathy
will
be
far
more
to
you
than
mine
i
must
have
slight
knowledge
of
myself
i
have
known
you
for
seven
years
and
though
you
were
a
child
when
we
first
spoke
to
each
other
i
foresaw
then
what
i
tell
you
now
every
woman
that
i
meet
i
compare
with
you
and
if
i
imagine
the
ideal
woman
she
has
your
face
and
your
mind
i
should
have
spoken
when
i
was
here
last
autumn
but
i
felt
that
i
had
no
right
to
ask
you
to
share
my
life
as
long
as
it
remained
so
valueless
you
see
he
smiled
i
have
grown
in
my
own
esteem
i
suppose
that
is
always
the
first
effect
of
a
purpose
strongly
conceived
or
should
it
be
just
the
opposite
and
have
i
only
given
you
a
proof
that
i
snatch
at
rewards
before
doing
the
least
thing
to
merit
them
something
in
these
last
sentences
jarred
upon
her
and
gave
her
courage
to
speak
a
thought
which
had
often
come
to
her
in
connection
with
egremont
think
that
a
woman
does
not
reason
in
that
way
if
her
deepest
feelings
are
pledged
if
i
were
able
to
go
with
you
and
share
your
life
i
should
think
i
was
rewarding
you
but
that
you
were
offering
me
a
great
happiness
it
is
my
loss
that
i
can
only
watch
you
from
a
distance
the
words
moved
him
it
was
not
with
conscious
insincerity
that
he
spoke
of
his
love
and
his
intellectual
aims
as
interdependent
yet
he
knew
that
annabel
revealed
the
truer
mind
my
desire
is
for
the
happiness
of
your
love
he
exclaimed
that
pedantry
always
my
fault
i
can
not
feel
sure
that
my
other
motives
will
keep
their
force
but
i
know
that
this
desire
will
be
only
stronger
in
me
as
time
goes
on
yet
when
she
kept
silence
the
habit
of
his
thought
again
uttered
itself
shall
pursue
this
work
that
i
have
undertaken
because
loving
you
i
dare
not
fall
below
the
highest
life
of
which
i
am
capable
i
know
that
you
can
see
into
my
nature
with
those
clear
eyes
of
yours
i
could
not
love
you
if
i
did
not
feel
that
you
were
far
above
me
i
shall
never
be
worthy
of
you
but
i
shall
never
cease
in
my
striving
to
become
so
the
quickening
of
her
blood
which
at
first
troubled
her
had
long
since
subsided
she
could
now
listen
to
him
and
think
of
her
reply
almost
with
coldness
there
was
an
unreality
in
the
situation
which
made
her
anxious
to
bring
the
dialogue
to
an
end
have
all
faith
in
you
she
said
hope
i
feel
assured
that
something
will
come
of
your
work
but
it
will
only
be
so
if
you
pursue
it
for
its
own
sake
the
simple
truth
of
this
caused
him
to
droop
his
eyes
again
with
a
sense
of
shame
he
grew
impatient
with
himself
had
he
no
plain
touching
words
in
which
to
express
his
very
real
love
words
such
as
every
man
can
summon
when
he
pleads
for
this
greatest
boon
yet
his
shame
heightened
the
reverence
in
which
he
held
her
passion
of
the
intellect
breathed
in
his
next
words
you
can
not
love
me
with
your
heart
in
your
mind
you
can
be
one
with
me
you
feel
the
great
and
the
beautiful
things
of
life
there
is
no
littleness
in
your
nature
in
reading
with
you
just
now
i
saw
that
your
delight
in
poetry
was
as
as
my
own
your
voice
had
the
true
music
and
your
cheeks
warmed
with
sympathy
you
do
not
deny
me
the
right
to
claim
so
much
kinship
with
you
i
too
love
all
that
is
rare
and
noble
however
in
myself
i
fall
below
such
ideals
say
that
you
admit
me
as
something
more
than
the
friend
of
the
everyday
world
look
for
once
straight
into
my
eyes
and
know
me
there
was
no
doubtful
ring
in
this
annabel
felt
the
chords
of
her
being
smitten
to
music
she
held
her
hand
to
him

very
near

long
when

something
to
tell

that
our
house
always
welcomes
you
he
released
her
hand
and
they
walked
homewards
the
sky
was
again
overcast
a
fresh
gust
came
from
the
and
bore
with
it
drops
of
rain
must
hasten
annabel
said
in
a
changed
voice
at
that
magnificent
cloud
by
the
sun
the
rain
sweet
here
she
continued
anxious
to
the
quiet
natural
tone
between
them
like
the
perfume
and
the
taste
of
it
i
remember
how
mournful
the
rain
used
to
be
in
london
streets
they
regained
the
house
annabel
passed
quickly
upstairs
egremont
remained
standing
in
the
porch
looking
forth
upon
the
garden
his
reverie
was
broken
by
a
voice
gloomy
the
rain
is
here
one
does
mind
it
in
london
always
something
to
do
and
somewhere
to
go
it
was
paula
egremont
could
not
help
showing
amusement
you
stay
much
longer
he
asked
do
know
she
spoke
with
indifference
keeping
her
eyes
averted
must
catch
the
mail
at
penrith
this
evening
he
said
afraid
it
will
be
a
wet
drive
going
are
you
not
to
jersey
again
i
hope
not
seems
to
make
people
very
dull
i
shall
warn
all
my
friends
against
it
she
hummed
an
air
and
left
him
late
in
the
afternoon
egremont
took
leave
of
his
friends
newthorpe
went
out
into
the
rain
and
at
the
last
moment
shook
hands
with
him
heartily
annabel
stood
at
the
window
and
smiled
farewell
the
wheels
splashed
along
the
road
rain
fell
in
torrents
egremont
presently
looked
back
from
the
carriage
window
the
house
was
already
out
of
view
and
the
summits
of
the
circling
hills
were
wreathed
with
cloud
chapter
iii
a
corner
of
lambeth
a
working
man
one
gilbert
grail
was
spending
an
hour
of
his
saturday
afternoon
in
westminster
abbey
at
five
the
sky
still
pulsed
with
heat
black
shadows
were
sharp
edged
upon
the
yellow
pavement
between
the
bridges
of
westminster
and
lambeth
the
river
was
a
colourless
gleam
but
in
the
sanctuary
evening
had
fallen
above
the
cool
twilight
of
the
aisles
floated
a
golden
mist
and
the
echo
of
a
footfall
hushed
itself
among
the
tombs
he
was
a
man
past
youth
but
of
less
than
middle
age
with
meagre
limbs
and
shoulders
a
little
bent
his
clothing
was
rough
but
decent
his
small
and
white
hands
gave
evidence
of
occupation
which
was
not
rudely
laborious
he
had
a
large
head
thickly
covered
with
dark
hair
which
with
his
moustache
and
beard
heightened
the
wanness
of
his
complexion
a
massive
forehead
eyes
thin
straight
nose
large
lips
constantly
drawn
inwards
made
a
physiognomy
impressive
rather
than
pleasing
the
cast
of
thought
was
upon
it
of
thought
eager
and
the
mark
of
a
spirit
ever
straining
after
something
unattainable
at
moments
when
he
found
satisfaction
in
reading
the
legend
on
some
monument
his
eyes
grew
placid
and
his
beetling
brows
smoothed
themselves
but
the
haunter
within
would
not
be
forgotten
and
as
if
at
a
sudden
recollection
he
dropped
his
eyes
in
a
troubled
way
and
moved
onwards
brooding
in
those
brief
intervals
of
peace
his
countenance
expressed
an
absorbing
reverence
a
profound
humility
the
same
was
evident
in
his
bearing
he
walked
as
softly
as
possible
and
avoided
treading
upon
a
sculptured
name
when
he
passed
out
into
the
sunny
street
he
stood
for
an
instant
with
a
hand
veiling
his
eyes
as
if
the
sudden
light
were
too
strong
then
he
looked
hither
and
thither
with
absent
gaze
and
at
length
bent
his
steps
in
the
direction
of
westminster
bridge
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
he
descended
the
stairs
to
the
albert
embankment
and
walked
along
by
thomas
hospital
presently
he
overtook
a
man
who
was
reading
as
he
walked
a
second
book
being
held
under
his
arm
it
was
a
young
workman
of
or
tall
of
wiry
frame
upright
grail
grasped
his
shoulder
in
a
friendly
way
asking
now
it
tempted
eighteenpence
out
of
my
pocket
was
the
reply
as
he
gave
the
volume
to
be
examined
wanted
a
book
on
electricity
for
some
time
he
spoke
with
a
slight
north
of
england
accent
his
name
was
luke
ackroyd
he
had
come
to
london
as
a
lad
and
was
now
a
of
grail
there
was
rough
comeliness
in
his
face
and
plenty
of
intelligence
something
at
the
same
time
not
quite
satisfactory
if
one
looked
for
strength
of
character
he
smiled
readily
and
had
eyes
which
told
of
quick
but
unsteady
thought
a
mouth
too
which
expressed
a
good
deal
of
and
probably
a
strain
of
sensuality
his
manner
was
hearty
his
look
frank
to
a
fault
and
full
of
sensibility
found
it
at
the
shop
by
westminster
bridge
he
continued
ought
to
go
and
have
a
look
there
i
saw
one
or
two
things
pretty
cheap
that
i
thought
were
in
your
way
the
other
grail
inquired
returning
the
work
on
electricity
which
he
had
glanced
through
without
show
of
much
interest
this
belongs
to
jo
bunce
ackroyd
replied
laughing
just
lent
it
me
it
was
a
collection
of
antitheistic
discourses
the
titles
which
were
startling
to
the
eye
sufficiently
indicated
the
scope
and
quality
of
the
matter
grail
found
even
less
satisfaction
in
this
than
in
the
other
volume
man
must
have
a
good
deal
of
time
to
spare
he
said
with
a
smile
he
spends
it
on
stuff
of
that
kind
i
do
know
about
that
you
do
need
it
but
there
plenty
of
people
that
do
that
the
kind
of
thing
bunce
gives
his
children
to
read
eh
he
bringing
them
up
on
it
he
made
them
learn
a
creed
and
hears
them
say
it
every
night
i
in
such
matters
said
grail
not
caring
to
pursue
the
discussion
a
good
deal
rather
hear
children
say
the
ordinary
prayer
ackroyd
laughed
you
heard
any
talk
he
asked
presently
lectures
by
a
egremont
he
a
son
of
bower
old
governor
what
lectures
tells
me
he
a
young
fellow
just
come
from
oxford
or
cambridge
and
he
going
to
give
some
free
lectures
here
in
lambeth
something
to
do
with
literature
ackroyd
broke
into
another
laugh
louder
this
time
and
contemptuous
to
the
dog
that
beginning
to
show
his
teeth
he
exclaimed
shows
you
what
coming
the
capitalists
are
beginning
to
look
about
and
ask
what
they
can
do
to
keep
the
people
quiet
lectures
on
literature
fools
as
if
that
was
just
the
way
to
remind
us
of
what
we
missed
in
the
way
of
education
it
the
best
joke
you
could
hit
on
let
him
lecture
away
he
do
more
than
he
thinks
does
he
give
them
grail
inquired
has
begun
yet
bower
seems
to
be
going
round
to
get
men
to
hear
him
do
you
think
you
like
to
go
depends
what
sort
of
a
man
he
is
conceited
young
fool
i
expect
grail
smiled
in
such
conversation
they
passed
the
archbishop
palace
then
from
the
foot
of
lambeth
bridge
turned
into
a
district
of
small
houses
and
multifarious
workshops
presently
they
entered
paradise
street
the
name
is
less
descriptive
than
it
might
be
poor
dwellings
mean
and
cheerless
are
interspersed
with
factories
and
one
or
two
small
shops
a
is
prominent
and
a
railway
arch
breaks
the
perspective
of
the
thoroughfare
midway
the
street
at
that
time
in
the
year
began
by
the
side
of
a
graveyard
no
longer
used
and
associated
in
the
minds
of
those
who
dwelt
around
it
with
numberless
burials
in
a
dire
season
of
cholera
the
space
has
since
been
converted
into
a
open
to
the
children
of
the
neighbourhood
and
in
summer
time
the
bright
enhance
the
ignoble
baldness
of
the
when
they
had
nearly
reached
the
railway
arch
ackroyd
stopped
just
going
in
to
bower
shop
he
said
got
a
message
for
poor
old
boddy
know
of
him
from
the
trent
girls
do
you
yes
grail
answered
nodding
he
seemed
about
to
add
something
but
checked
himself
and
with
a
went
his
way
ackroyd
turned
his
steps
to
a
little
shop
close
by
it
was
of
the
kind
known
as
the
general
over
the
door
stood
the
name
of
the
proprietor
and
on
the
woodwork
along
the
top
of
the
windows
was
painted
in
characters
of
faded
red
little
shop
with
the
large
heart
little
it
certainly
was
and
large
of
heart
if
the
term
could
be
made
to
signify
an
abundant
stock
the
interior
was
so
packed
with
an
indescribable
variety
of
merchandise
that
there
was
scarcely
space
for
more
than
two
customers
between
door
and
counter
from
an
inner
room
came
the
sound
of
a
violin
playing
a
lively
air
when
the
young
man
stepped
through
the
doorway
he
was
at
once
encompassed
with
the
strangest
blend
of
odours
every
article
in
the
shop
groceries
of
all
kinds
pastry
cooked
meat
bloaters
newspapers
petty
haberdashery
firewood
fruit
soap
seemed
to
exhale
its
essence
distressfully
under
the
heat
impossible
that
anything
sold
here
should
preserve
its
native
savour
the
air
swarmed
with
flies
spite
of
the
dread
example
of
thousands
that
lay
extinct
on
sheets
of
smeared
newspaper
on
the
counter
among
other
things
was
a
perspiring
yellow
mass
retailed
under
the
name
of
butter
its
destiny
hovered
between
avoirdupois
and
the
measure
of
capacity
a
literature
of
advertisements
hung
around
blacking
blue
with
a
certain
salve
proclaimed
themselves
in
letters
one
descried
too
a
scrubby
but
significant
little
card
which
bore
the
address
of
a
loan
office
the
music
issued
from
the
parlour
behind
the
shop
it
ceased
as
ackroyd
approached
the
counter
and
at
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
appeared
bower
she
was
a
stout
woman
of
middle
age
red
of
face
much
given
to
laughter
wholesomely
vulgar
at
four
every
afternoon
she
laid
aside
her
sober
garments
of
the
working
day
and
came
forth
in
an
evening
costume
which
was
the
admiration
and
envy
of
paradise
street
popular
from
a
certain
wordy
which
she
always
had
at
command
she
derived
from
this
evening
garb
a
social
superiority
which
friends
and
neighbours
whether
they
would
or
no
were
constrained
to
recognise
she
was
deemed
a
woman
and
as
such
paradise
street
held
it
axiomatic
might
reasonably
adorn
herself
for
the
respect
of
those
to
whom
she
sold
miscellaneous
pennyworths
she
did
not
depend
upon
the
business
her
husband
as
we
already
know
was
a
foreman
at
egremont
pollard
oilcloth
manufactory
they
were
known
to
have
money
laid
by
you
saw
in
her
face
that
life
had
been
smooth
with
her
from
the
beginning
she
wore
a
purple
dress
with
a
yellow
fichu
in
which
was
fixed
a
large
silver
brooch
on
her
head
was
a
small
lace
cap
her
hands
were
enormous
and
very
red
as
she
came
into
the
shop
she
mopped
her
forehead
with
a
handkerchief
perspiration
streamed
from
every
pore
a
man
you
are
for
keepin
yourself
cool
mr
hackroyd
she
exclaimed
like
a
breath
o
fresh
air
to
look
at
you
i
sure
if
this
kind
o
weather
goes
on
there
wo
be
much
left
o
me
like
the
butter
warmish
that
true
said
luke
when
she
had
finished
her
laugh
heard
boddy
playing
in
there
and
i
got
a
message
for
him
in
and
sit
down
he
just
practisin
a
new
piece
for
his
club
ackroyd
advanced
into
the
parlour
the
table
was
spread
for
tea
and
at
the
tray
sat
bower
daughter
mary
she
was
a
girl
of
nineteen
sparely
made
and
rather
yet
with
a
thoughtful
interesting
face
her
smile
was
brief
and
always
passed
into
an
expression
of
melancholy
which
in
its
turn
did
not
last
long
for
the
most
part
she
seemed
occupied
with
thoughts
which
lay
on
the
borderland
between
reflection
and
anxiety
her
dress
was
remarkably
plain
contrasting
with
her
mother
and
her
hair
was
arranged
in
the
simplest
way
in
a
chair
at
a
distance
from
the
table
sat
an
old
man
with
a
wooden
leg
a
fiddle
on
his
knee
his
face
was
parchmenty
his
cheeks
sunken
his
lips
compressed
into
a
long
straight
line
his
small
grey
eyes
had
an
anxious
look
yet
were
ever
ready
to
twinkle
into
a
smile
he
wore
a
suit
of
black
preserved
from
sheer
decay
by
a
needle
too
evidently
unskilled
wrapped
about
a
scarcely
visible
collar
was
a
broad
black
neckcloth
of
the
antique
fashion
his
one
shoe
was
cobbled
into
shapelessness
boddy
spirit
had
proved
more
durable
than
his
garments
often
hard
set
to
earn
the
few
shillings
a
week
that
sufficed
to
him
he
kept
up
a
reputation
for
joviality
and
with
the
aid
of
his
fiddle
made
himself
welcome
at
many
a
festive
gathering
in
lambeth
hackroyd
a
cup
o
tea
mary
said
bower
you
pore
men
go
about
your
work
days
like
this
is
more
than
i
can
understand
i
have
life
enough
in
me
to
drive
away
a
fly
as
settles
on
my
nose
it
all
very
well
for
you
to
laugh
boddy
there
good
in
everything
if
we
only
see
it
and
you
may
thank
the
trouble
you
had
as
it
kep
your
flesh
down
ackroyd
addressed
the
old
man
a
friend
of
mine
in
newport
street
would
be
glad
to
have
you
do
a
little
job
for
him
boddy
two
or
three
chairs
i
think
boddy
held
forth
his
stumpy
wrinkled
hand
us
a
friendly
grip
ackroyd
there
never
a
friend
in
this
world
but
the
man
as
finds
you
work
that
the
philosophy
as
has
come
o
my
years
what
the
name
and
address

be
round
the
first
thing
on
monday
morning
the
information
was
given
just
make
a
note
o
that
in
your
head
mary
my
dear
the
old
mam
continued
very
likely
i
forget
but
my
memory
do
play
me
a
trick
now
and
then
ask
me
about
things
as
happened
fifty
years
ago
and
i
serve
you
as
well
as
the
almanac
it
the
same
with
my
eyes
i
used
to
be
and
now
i
read
you
the
across
the
street
easier
than
that
big
bill
on
the
wall
he
raised
his
violin
and
struck
out
with
spirit
march
of
the
men
of
harlech
the
teen
as
always
goes
with
me
on
my
way
to
work
he
said
with
a
laugh
keeps
up
my
courage
this
old
timber
o
mine
stumps
time
on
the
pavement
and
i
feel
i
good
for
something
yet
if
only
the
hand
keep
steady
firm
enough
yet
eh
mr
ackroyd
he
swept
the
bow
through
a
few
ringing
chords
enough
said
luke

fine
tone
too
i
suppose

older
the
fiddle
is
the
better
it
gets
like
these

than
sixty

me
as
taught
her

to
be
sure
as
i
did
most
o
the
other
songs

was
a
baby

years

boddy
nodding
with
a
laugh

bower
thirteen
year
ago
next
fourteenth
o
december
ackroyd
there
a
deal
happened
since
then
on
that
day
i
had
my
shop
in
the
cut
and
i
had
two
legs
like
other
mortals
things

doing
so
bad
with
me
why
it
like
yesterday
to
remember
my
wife
she
come
into
the
shop
just
before
there
a
boiler
busted
at
walton
she
says
an
they
say
as
trent
killed
it
was
walton
the
in
ground
street
simpson
thomas
now
remarked
bower
where
jim
candle
works
you
know
mr
hackroyd
luke
nodded
knowing
the
circumstance
the
whole
story
was
familiar
to
him
indeed
but
boddy
talked
on
in
an
old
man
way
for
pleasure
in
the
past
it
is
so
it
is
me
an
my
wife
took
the
little
to
the
he
knew
did
poor
mat
but
he
could
speak
what
a
face
he
had
thyrza
was
frighted
and
cried
lyddy
just
held
on
hard
to
my
hand
but
she
did
cry
i
do
remember
to
a
seen
lyddy
cry
more
than
two
or
three
times
in
my
life
she
always
hid
away
for
that
when
she
could
help
herself
bless
her
grows
more
an
more
like
her
father
said
bower
does
she
does
i
used
to
say
as
she
was
like
him
when
she
sat
in
my
shop
of
a
night
and
watched
the
people
in
and
out
her
eyes
was
so
just
like
mat
eh
there
was
much
as
the
little
did
see
one
day
how
my
wife
did
laugh
she
looks
at
me
for
a
long
time
an
then
she
says
how
is
it
boddy
she
says
as
you
got
one
eyelid
lower
than
the
other
it
true
as
i
have
a
bit
of
a
droop
in
the
right
eye
but
it
not
so
much
as
any
one
notice
it
at
once
i
can
hear
her
say
that
as
if
it
was
in
this
room
an
she
stood
before
me
a
little
thing
that
high
i
did
think
be
so
tall
she
growed
wonderful
from
twelve
to
sixteen
it
me
has
to
look
up
to
her
now
a
customer
entered
the
shop
and
bower
went
out
do
think
thyrza
as
much
a
favourite
with
any
one
as
her
sister
said
ackroyd
looking
at
mary
bower
who
had
been
silent
all
this
time
i
like
her
very
much
was
the
reply
there
something
i
do
think
she
as
easy
to
understand
as
lydia
still
i
wonder
if
she
pleases
some
people
more
mary
dropped
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
and
smiled
gently
ackroyd
tapped
with
his
foot
totty
nancarrow
said
bower
reappearing
from
the
shop
a
girl
that
is
to
be
sure
she
for
all
the
world
like
a
lad
put
into
petticoats
i
should
think
there
to
be
a
feast
over
in
newport
street
a
tin
o
sardines
four
bottles
o
two
pound
o
seed
cake
an
two
pots
o
raspberry
eh
she
a
queer
i
ca
think
where
she
gets
her
money
from
either
a
pity
to
see
thyrza
going
about
with
her
so
much
said
mary
gravely
i
ca
say
as
i
know
any
real
harm
of
her
said
her
mother
it
is
as
she
a
catholic
nancarrow
a
catholic
exclaimed
ackroyd
i
never
knew
that
mother
was
irish
you
see
an
i
do
suppose
as
her
father
thought
much
about
religion
i
dessay
there
some
good
people
catholics
but
i
ca
say
as
i
take
much
to
them
i
know
mary
face
was
expressing
lively
feeling
can
they
be
really
good
mother
when
their
religion
lets
them
do
wrong
if
only
they
go
and
confess
it
to
the
priest
i
trust
anybody
as
was
a
catholic
i
do
think
the
religion
ought
to
be
allowed
here
was
evidently
a
subject
which
had
power
to
draw
mary
from
her
wonted
reticence
her
quiet
eyes
gleamed
all
at
once
with
indignation
ackroyd
laughed
with
ridicule
he
said
time
gone
by
for
that
kind
of
thing
miss
bower
you
would
have
us
begin
religious
persecution
again
do
want
to
persecute
anybody
the
girl
answered
i
let
them
be
misled
by
a
bad
and
false
religion
on
any
other
subject
mary
would
have
expressed
her
opinion
with
diffidence
not
on
this
do
want
to
be
rude
miss
mary
luke
rejoined
what
right
have
you
to
say
that
their
religion
any
worse
or
falser
than
your
own
knows
that
it
is
that
cares
about
religion
at
all
mary
replied
with
coldness
and
in
the
last
words
a
significant
severity
the
faith
mary
my
dear
interposed
boddy
faith
the
great
thing
i
do
suppose
as
form
matters
so
much
the
girl
gave
the
old
man
a
brief
offended
glance
and
drew
into
herself
said
bower
one
way
o
lookin
at
it
but
i
see
neither
as
there
much
good
in
believin
what
is
true
to
the
point
bower
said
ackroyd
with
a
smile
there
was
a
footstep
in
the
shop
firm
yet
light
and
quick
then
a
girl
face
showed
itself
at
the
parlour
door
it
was
a
face
which
atoned
for
lack
of
regular
features
by
the
bright
intelligence
and
the
warmth
of
heart
that
shone
in
its
smile
of
greeting
a
fair
broad
forehead
lay
above
brows
the
eyes
below
were
large
and
shrewdly
observant
with
laughter
and
kindness
blent
in
their
dark
depths
the
cheeks
were
warm
with
health
the
lips
and
chin
were
strong
yet
marked
with
refinement
they
told
of
independence
of
fervid
instincts
perhaps
of
a
temper
a
little
apt
to
be
impatient
it
was
not
an
imaginative
countenance
yet
alive
with
thought
and
feeling
all
one
felt
ready
at
the
moment
need
the
kind
of
face
which
becomes
the
light
and
joy
of
home
the
bliss
of
children
the
unfailing
support
of
a
man
courage
her
hair
was
cut
short
and
crisped
itself
above
her
neck
her
hat
of
black
straw
and
dark
dress
were
those
of
a
poor
yet
in
their
lack
of
adornment
suiting
well
with
the
active
helpful
impression
which
her
look
produced
mary
an
hackroyd
fallin
out
again
lydia
said
bower
about
now
lydia
asked
coming
in
and
seating
herself
her
eyes
passed
quickly
over
ackroyd
face
and
rested
on
that
of
the
old
man
with
much
kindness
the
hold
talk
about
religion
think
it
be
better
if
they
left
that
alone
she
replied
glancing
at
mary
right
miss
trent
said
luke
about
the
most
unprofitable
thing
anyone
can
argue
about
you
had
your
tea
bower

lydia
but
i
must
stop
to
have
any
thank

nodded

and
went

lydia
asked

to
sit
by
boddy

thing
as

the
world
how

i
did

but
she

make
up
her
mind

hot

restless

bower

chair

and
the
girls

shilling
and
i
sure

was
worth
half
that
all
i
did

know
what
did
you
ever
know

a
girl
lydia
exclaimed
looking
round
at
the
others
understand
what
she
means
mrs
bower
dare
say
i
do
my
dear
i
ca
promise
mary
i

like

always
do
see

said
mary
lydia
shook
her
head
you
come
at
four
at
all
events
and
we
see
all
about
it
grandad
she
hurried
away
throwing
back
a
bright
look
as
she
passed
into
the
shop
paradise
street
runs
at
right
angles
into
lambeth
walk
as
lydia
approached
this
point
she
saw
that
ackroyd
stood
there
apparently
waiting
for
her
he
was
turning
over
the
leaves
of
one
of
his
books
but
kept
glancing
towards
her
as
she
drew
near
he
wished
to
speak
and
she
stopped
you
think
he
said
with
diffidence
your
sister
would
come
out
after
tea
lydia
kept
her
eyes
down
do
know
ackroyd
she
answered
ask
her
i
don
t
think
she
going
anywhere
wo
be
like
last
sunday
really
did
feel
well
and
i
ca
promise
you
know
mr
ackroyd
she
met
his
eyes
for
an
instant
then
looked
along
the
street
there
was
a
faint
smile
on
her
lips
with
just
a
suspicion
of
some
trouble
you
ask
her
i
will
she
added
in
a
lower
voice
and
with
constraint
afraid
she
wo
go
by
herself
come
with
her
do
will
you
she
asks
me
to
i
will
lydia
moved
as
if
to
leave
him
but
he
followed
trent
you
say
a
word
for
me
sometimes
she
raised
her
eyes
again
and
replied
quickly
never
say
nothing
against
you
mr
ackroyd
you
then
i
be
at
the
end
of
the
walk
at
six
shall
i
she
nodded
and
walked
quickly
on
ackroyd
turned
back
into
paradise
street
his
cheeks
were
a
trifle
flushed
and
he
kept
making
nervous
movements
with
his
head
so
busy
were
his
thoughts
that
he
unconsciously
passed
the
door
of
the
house
in
which
he
lived
and
had
to
turn
when
the
roar
of
a
train
passing
over
the
archway
reminded
him
where
he
was
chapter
iv
thyrza
sings
lydis
too
betrayed
some
disturbance
of
thought
as
she
pursued
her
way
her
face
was
graver
than
before
once
or
twice
her
lips
moved
as
if
she
were
speaking
to
herself
after
going
a
short
distance
along
lambeth
walk
she
turned
off
into
a
street
which
began
unpromisingly
between
and
houses
but
soon
bettered
in
appearance
its
name
is
walnut
tree
walk
for
the
most
part
it
consists
of
old
dwellings
which
probably
were
the
houses
of
people
above
the
working
class
in
days
when
lambeth
squalor
was
confined
within
narrower
limits
the
doors
are
framed
with
dark
wood
and
have
hanging
porches
at
the
end
of
the
street
is
a
glimpse
of
trees
growing
in
kennington
road
to
one
of
these
houses
lydia
admitted
herself
with
a
she
ascended
to
the
top
floor
and
entered
a
room
in
the
front
it
was
sparely
furnished
but
with
a
certain
cleanly
comfort
a
bed
stood
in
one
corner
in
another
a
small
between
them
a
low
chest
of
drawers
with
a
upon
it
the
rest
was
arranged
for
day
use
a
cupboard
kept
out
of
sight
household
utensils
and
food
being
immediately
under
the
roof
the
room
was
much
heated
after
long
hours
of
sunshine
from
the
open
window
came
a
heavy
scent
of
mignonette
thyrza
had
laid
the
table
for
tea
and
was
sitting
idly
it
was
not
easy
to
recognise
her
as
lydia
sister
if
you
searched
her
features
the
sisterhood
was
there
but
the
type
of
countenance
was
so
subtly
modified
so
refined
as
to
become
beauty
of
rare
suggestiveness
she
was
of
pale
complexion
and
had
golden
hair
it
was
plaited
in
one
braid
which
fell
to
her
waist
like
lydia
her
eyes
were
large
and
full
of
light
every
line
of
the
face
was
delicate
harmonious
sweet
each
thought
that
passed
through
her
mind
reflected
itself
in
a
change
of
expression
produced
one
knew
not
how
one
phase
melting
into
another
like
flitting
lights
upon
a
stream
in
woodland
it
was
a
subtly
morbid
physiognomy
and
impressed
one
with
a
sense
of
vague
trouble
there
was
none
of
the
spontaneous
pleasure
in
life
which
gave
face
such
wholesome
brightness
no
impulse
of
activity
no
resolve
all
tended
to
preoccupation
to
emotional
reverie
she
had
not
yet
completed
her
seventeenth
year
and
there
was
still
something
of
childhood
in
her
movements
her
form
was
slight
graceful
and
of
lower
stature
than
her
sister
she
wore
a
dress
of
print
with
a
broad
collar
of
cheap
lace
was
too
hot
to
light
a
fire
she
said
rising
as
lydia
entered
jarmey
says
she
give
us
water
for
the
tea
hoped
you
be
having
yours
lydia
replied
nearly
six
i
take
the
down
dear
when
they
were
seated
at
the
table
lydia
drew
from
her
pocket
a
shilling
and
held
it
up
laughingly
from
mrs
isaacs
her
sister
asked
not
bad
for
saturday
afternoon
is
it
now
i
must
take
my
boots
to
be
done
if
it
began
to
rain
i
should
be
in
a
nice
fix
i
have
a
sole
to
walk
on
just
looked
in
at
bower
as
i
passed
she
continued
presently
ackroyd
was
there
he
come
to
tell
grandad
of
some
work
that
was
kind
of
him
was
it
thyrza
assented
absently
mary
coming
to
tea
she
asked
at
least
she
said
she
would
if
i
go
to
chapel
with
her
afterwards
she
wo
be
satisfied
till
she
gets
me
there
every
sunday
tiresome
lyddy
there
somebody
wants
you
to
go
out
as
well
you
know
who
mean
mr
ackroyd
he
met
me
when
i
came
out
of
bower
and
asked
me
if
i
thought
you
would
thyrza
was
silent
for
a
little
then
she
said
ca
go
with
him
alone
lyddy
i
do
mind
if
you
go
too
that
just
what
he
does
want
said
her
sister
with
a
smile
which
was
not
quite
natural
thyrza
averted
her
eyes
and
began
to
speak
of
something
else
the
meal
was
quickly
over
then
lydia
took
up
some
sewing
thyrza
went
to
the
window
and
stood
for
a
while
looking
at
the
people
that
passed
but
presently
she
seated
herself
and
fell
into
the
brooding
which
her
sister
entrance
had
interrupted
lydia
also
was
quieter
than
usual
her
eyes
often
wandered
from
her
work
to
thyrza
at
last
she
leaned
forward
and
said
are
you
thinking
of
thyrza
drew
a
deep
sigh
do
know
lyddy
it
so
hot
i
do
feel
able
to
do
anything
you
always
thinking
and
thinking
what
is
it
that
troubles
you
feel
dull
do
you
like
to
go
out
with
mr
ackroyd
lydia
asked
do
you
so
much
want
me
to
lyddy
he
thinks
a
great
deal
of
you
and
it
would
be
nice
if
you
got
to
like
him
i
sha
never
i
know
i
sha
not
dear
do
him
but
he
must
get
to
think
it
any
thing
else
i
go
out
with
him
if
you
go
as
well
she
added
fixing
her
eyes
on
lydia
the
latter
bent
to
pick
up
a
reel
of
cotton
see
when
comes
she
said
silence
again
fell
between
them
whilst
lydia
fingers
worked
rapidly
the
evening
drew
on
thyrza
took
her
chair
to
the
window
leaned
upon
the
sill
and
looked
up
at
the
reddening
sky
the
windows
of
the
other
houses
were
all
open
here
and
there
women
talked
from
them
with
friends
across
the
street
people
were
going
backwards
and
forwards
with
bags
and
baskets
on
the
business
of
saturday
evening
in
the
distance
sounded
the
noise
of
the
market
in
lambeth
walk
shortly
after
eight
lydia
said
just
go
round
with
my
boots
and
get
something
for
dinner
come
with
you
thyrza
said
ca
bear
to
sit
here
any
longer
they
went
forth
and
were
soon
in
the
midst
of
the
market
lambeth
walk
is
a
long
narrow
street
and
at
this
hour
was
so
thronged
with
people
that
an
occasional
vehicle
with
difficulty
made
slow
passage
on
the
outer
edges
of
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
busy
shops
were
rows
of
booths
stalls
and
harrows
whereon
meat
vegetables
fish
and
household
requirements
of
indescribable
variety
were
exposed
for
sale
the
vendors
vied
with
one
another
in
uproarious
advertisement
of
their
goods
in
vociferation
the
butchers
doubtless
excelled
their
lovely
lovely
and
their
reiterated
buy
buy
rang
clangorous
above
the
hoarse
roaring
of
costermongers
and
the
din
of
those
who
clattered
pots
and
pans
here
and
there
meat
was
being
sold
by
dutch
auction
a
brisk
business
umbrellas
articles
of
clothing
quack
medicines
were
disposed
of
in
the
same
way
giving
occasion
for
much
coarse
humour
the
is
the
sole
amusement
regularly
at
hand
for
london
working
people
the
only
one
in
truth
for
which
they
show
any
real
capacity
everywhere
was
laughter
and
interchange
of
women
sauntered
the
length
of
the
street
and
back
again
for
the
pleasure
of
picking
out
the
best
and
cheapest
bundle
of
rhubarb
or
lettuce
the
biggest
and
hardest
cabbage
the
most
appetising
rasher
they
compared
notes
and
bantered
each
other
on
purchases
the
hot
air
reeked
with
odours
from
stalls
where
whelks
were
sold
rose
the
pungency
of
vinegar
decaying
vegetables
trodden
under
foot
blended
their
putridness
with
the
musty
smell
of
garments
the
grocers
shops
were
aromatic
above
all
was
distinguishable
the
acrid
exhalation
from
the
shops
where
fried
fish
and
potatoes
hissed
in
boiling
grease
there
lambeth
supper
was
preparing
to
be
eaten
on
the
spot
or
taken
away
wrapped
in
newspaper
stewed
eels
and
baked
meat
pies
were
discoverable
through
the
steam
of
other
windows
but
the
fried
fish
and
potatoes
appealed
irresistibly
to
the
palate
through
the
nostrils
and
stood
first
in
popularity
the
people
were
of
the
very
various
classes
which
subdivide
the
great
proletarian
order
children
of
the
gutter
and
sexless
haunters
of
the
street
corner
elbowed
comfortable
artisans
and
their
wives
there
were
bareheaded
hoidens
from
the
obscurest
courts
and
whose
was
proof
against
all
the
squalor
and
vileness
hourly
surrounding
them
of
the
women
whatsoever
their
appearance
the
great
majority
carried
babies
wives
themselves
scarcely
past

balanced
bantlings
against

little
girls
of
nine
or
ten
were
going
from
stall
to
stall
making
purchases
with
the
confidence
and
acumen
of
old
housekeepers
slight
fear
that
they
would
fail
to
get
their
money
worth
children
too
had
the
business
of
sale
upon
their
hands
ragged
urchins
went
about
with
blocks
of
salt
importuning
the
marketers
and
dishevelled
girls
carried
bundles
of
assorted
vegetables
crying
penny
all
the

a
penny
the
lot
the
were
full
through
the
gaping
doors
you
saw
a
crowd
of
men
women
and
children
drinking
at
the
bar
or
waiting
to
have
their
jugs
filled
tobacco
smoke
wreathing
above
their
heads
with
few
exceptions
the
frequenters
of
the
walk
turned
into
the
as
a
natural
incident
of
the
evening
business
the
women
with
the
babies
grew
thirsty
in
the
hot
foul
air
of
the
street
and
invited
each
other
to
refreshment
of
varying
strength
chatting
the
while
of
their
most
intimate
affairs
the
eternal
i
he
she
of
vulgar
converse
they
stood
indifferently
by
the
side
of
creatures
whose
look
was
pollution
companies
of
girls
neatly
dressed
and
as
far
from
depravity
as
possible
called
for
their
glasses
of
small
beer
and
came
forth
again
with
merriment
in
treble
key
when
the
sisters
had
done
their
business
at
the
and
were
considering
what
their
purchase
should
be
for
sunday
dinner
thyrza
caught
sight
of
totty
nancarrow
entering
a
shop
at
once
she
said
wo
be
late
back
lyddy
i
just
going
to
walk
a
little
way
with
totty
lydia
face
showed
annoyance
is
she
she
asked
looking
back
the
butcher
just
there
go
thyrza
i
rather
you
did
promise
i
wo
be
late
only
half
an
hour
she
waved
her
hand
and
ran
off
of
a
sudden
changed
to
cheerfulness
totty
received
her
in
the
shop
with
a
friendly
laugh
description
of
miss
nancarrow
as
a
lad
in
petticoats
was
not
inapt
yet
she
was
by
no
means
heavy
or
awkward
she
had
a
lithe
shapely
figure
and
her
features
much
resembled
those
of
a
fairly
boy
her
attire
showed
little
care
for
personal
adornment
but
it
suited
her
because
it
suggested
bodily
activity
she
wore
a
plain
grey
gown
a
small
straw
hat
of
the
brimless
kind
and
a
white
linen
collar
about
her
neck
totty
was
nineteen
no
girl
in
lambeth
relished
life
with
so
much
determination
yet
to
all
appearance
so
harmlessly
her
independence
was
complete
for
five
years
she
had
been
parentless
and
had
lived
alone
thyrza
was
attracted
to
her
by
this
air
of
freedom
and
joyousness
which
distinguished
totty
it
was
a
character
wholly
unlike
her
own
and
her
imaginative
thought
discerned
in
it
something
of
an
ideal
her
own
timidity
and
her
tendency
to
languor
found
a
refreshing
antidote
in
the
other
breezy
carelessness
impurity
of
mind
would
have
repelled
her
and
there
was
no
trace
of
it
in
totty
yet
lydia
took
very
ill
this
companionship
holding
her
friend
mary
bower
view
of
the
girl
character
her
prejudice
was
enhanced
by
the
jealous
care
with
which
from
the
time
of
her
own
childhood
she
had
been
accustomed
to
watch
over
her
sister
already
there
had
been
trouble
between
thyrza
and
her
on
this
account
in
spite
of
the
unalterable
love
which
united
them
their
points
of
unlikeness
not
seldom
brought
about
debates
which
lydia
quick
temper
sometimes
aggravated
to
a
quarrel
so
lydia
finished
her
marketing
and
turned
homewards
with
a
perturbed
mind
but
the
other
two
walked
with
gossip
and
laughter
to
lodgings
which
were
in
newport
street
an
offshoot
of
paradise
street
going
with
annie
west
to
a
friendly
lead
totty
said
you
come
with
us
thyrza
hesitated
the
entertainment
known
as
a
lead
is
always
held
at
a
and
she
knew
that
lydia
would
seriously
disapprove
of
her
going
to
such
a
place
yet
she
had
even
a
physical
need
of
change
of
recreation
whilst
she
discussed
the
matter
anxiously
with
herself
they
entered
the
house
and
went
up
to
room
the
house
was
very
small
and
had
a
close
musty
smell
as
if
no
fresh
air
ever
got
into
it
totty
chamber
was
a
poor
bare
little
retreat
with
low
cracked
grimy
ceiling
and
one
scrap
of
carpet
on
the
floor
just
by
the
diminutive
bed
on
a
table
lay
the
provisions
she
had
that
afternoon
brought
in
from
bower
on
the

a
small
card
whereon
was
printed

table

use

if
you
do
enjoy
yourself
they
were
interrupted
by
a
knock
at
the
door
followed
by
the
appearance
of
annie
west
a
less
girl
than
totty
but
equally
vivacious
will
you
come
to
the
prince
albert
thyrza
totty
asked
ca
stay
long
was
the
answer
i
go
for
a
little
while
the
house
of
entertainment
was
at
no
great
distance
they
passed
through
the
bar
and
up
into
a
room
on
the
first
floor
where
a
miscellaneous
assembly
was
just
gathering
down
the
middle
was
a
long
table
with
benches
beside
it
and
a
chair
at
each
end
other
seats
were
ranged
along
the
walls
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
an
arrangement
of
dirty
red
hangings
in
the
form
of
a
canopy
surmounted
by
a
lion
and
unicorn
of
pasteboard
showed
that
festive
meetings
were
regularly
held
here
round
about
were
pictures
of
hunting
incidents
of
racehorses
of
politicians
and
pugilists
interspersed
with
advertisements
of
beverages
a
piano
occupied
one
corner
the
chairman
was
already
in
his
place
on
the
table
before
him
was
a
into
which
each
visitor
threw
a
contribution
on
arriving
seated
on
the
benches
were
a
number
of
men
women
and
girls
all
with
pewters
or
glasses
before
them
and
the
air
was
thickening
with
smoke
of
pipes
the
beneficiary
of
the
evening
a
portly
person
with
a
face
of
high
satisfaction
sat
near
the
chairman
and
by
him
were
two
girls
of
decent
appearance
his
daughters
the
president
puffed
at
a
churchwarden
and
exchanged
genial
banter
with
those
who
came
up
to
deposit
offerings
dick
perkins
the
vice
was
encouraging
a
spirit
of
conviviality
at
the
other
end
a
few
minutes
after
thyrza
and
her
companions
had
entered
a
youth
of
the
seediest
appearance
struck
introductory
chords
on
the
piano
and
started
off
at
high
pressure
with
a
selection
of
popular
melodies
the
room
by
degrees
grew
full
then
the
chairman
rose
and
with
jocular
remarks
announced
the
first
song
totty
had
several
acquaintances
present
male
and
female
her
laughter
frequently
sounded
above
the
hubbub
of
voices
thyrza
who
had
declined
to
have
anything
to
drink
shrank
into
as
little
space
as
possible
she
was
nervous
and
yet
the
singing
and
the
uproar
gave
her
a
certain
pleasure
there
was
nothing
in
the
talk
around
her
and
the
songs
that
were
sung
that
made
it
a
shame
for
her
to
be
present
plebeian
does
not
often
degenerate
into
brutality
at
meetings
of
this
kind
until
a
late
hour
of
the
evening
the
girls
who
sat
with
glasses
of
beer
before
them
and
carried
on
primitive
flirtations
with
their
neighbours
were
honest
of
factory
and
workshop
well
able
to
make
themselves
respected
if
they
lacked
refinement
natural
or
acquired
it
was
not
their
fault
toil
was
behind
them
and
before
the
hours
of
rest
were
few
suffering
and
lack
of
bread
might
at
any
moment
come
upon
them
they
had
all
thrown
their
pence
into
the
gladly
and
kindly
now
they
enjoyed
themselves
the
chairman
excited
enthusiasm
by
announcement
of
a
song
by
sam
coppock
known
to
the
company
as
sem
sam
was
a
young
man
who
clearly
had
no
small
opinion
of
himself
he
wore
a
necktie
and
had
a
geranium
flower
in
his
his
hair
was
cut
as
short
as
scissors
could
make
it
and
as
he
stood
regarding
the
assembly
he
twisted
the
ends
of
a
scarcely
visible
moustache
when
he
fixed
a
round
glass
in
one
eye
and
perked
his
head
with
a
burlesque
of
aristocratic
bearing
the
laughter
and
applause
were
deafening
a
warm
is
sem
was
the
delighted
comment
on
all
hands
the
pianist
made
discursive
prelude
then
coppock
gave
forth
a
ditty
of
the
most
sentimental
character
telling
of
the
disappearance
of
a
young
lady
to
whom
he
was
devoted
the
burden
in
which
all
bore
a
part
ran
thus
we
trecked
little
footprints
in
the
snayoo
we
trecked
little
footprints
in
the
snayoo
i
shall
forget
the
when
jenny
lost
her
and
we
trecked
little
footprints
in
the
snayoo
it
was
known
that
the
singer
had
thoughts
of
cultivating
his
talent
and
of
appearing
on
the
stage
it
was
not
unlikely
that
he
might
some
day
become
great
sam
a
second
song
was
called
for
and
granted
a
third
but
coppock
intimated
that
it
did
not
become
him
to
keep
other
talent
in
the
background
the
chairman
made
a
humorous
speech
informing
the
company
that
their
friend
would
stand
forth
again
later
in
the
evening
dick
perkins
was
at
present
about
to
oblige
the
vice
was
a
frisky
little
man
he
began
with
what
is
known
as
then
gave
melodious
account
of
a
romantic
meeting
with
a
damsel
whom
he
had
seen
only
once
to
lose
sight
of
for
ever
and
the
refrain
was
she
wore
a
bonnet
with
fruit
end
flowers
upon
it
end
she
dwelt
in
the
henvirons
of
as
yet
only
men
had
sung
solicitation
had
failed
with
such
of
the
girls
as
were
known
to
be
musically
given
yet
an
earnest
prayer
from
the
chairman
succeeded
at
length
in
overcoming
the
diffidence
of
one
she
was
a
pale
unhealthy
thing
and
wore
an
hat
with
a
gruesome
green
feather
she
sang
with
her
eyes
down
and
in
a
voice
which
did
not
lack
a
certain
sweetness
the
ballad
was
of
springtime
and
the
country
and
love
underneath
the
blossoms
oft
we
wandered
you
and
i
listening
to
the
whisper
like
a
stream
by
the
girl
had
a
drunken
mother
and
spent
a
month
or
two
of
every
year
in
the
hospital
for
her
day
work
overtaxed
her
strength
she
was
one
of
those
fated
toilers
to
struggle
on
as
long
as
any
one
would
employ
her
then
to
fall
among
the
forgotten
wretched
and
she
sang
of
and
love
of
love
that
had
never
come
near
her
and
that
she
would
never
know
sang
with
her
eyes
upon
the
table
in
a
amid
the
backways
of
lambeth
totty
nancarrow
was
whispering
to
thyrza
something
old
girl
why
should
you
annie
west
was
also
at
hand
urging
the
same
hear
some
real
singing
thyrza
there
a
dear
thyrza
was
in
sore
trouble
music
if
it
were
but
a
street
organ
always
stirred
her
heart
and
made
her
eager
for
the
joy
of
song
she
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
sing
before
a
number
of
people
the
prospect
of
applause
tempted
her
yet
she
had
scarcely
the
courage
and
the
thought
of
lydia
grief
and
anger
for
lydia
would
surely
hear
of
it
was
keenly
present
getting
late
she
replied
nervously
ca
stay
i
ca
sing
only
one
or
two
people
in
the
room
knew
her
by
sight
but
totty
had
led
to
its
being
passed
from
one
to
another
that
she
was
a
good
singer
the
landlord
of
the
house
happened
to
be
in
the
room
he
came
and
spoke
to
her
do
remember
me
miss
trent
but
i
knew
your
father
well
enough
and
i
knew
you
when
you
was
a
little
in
those
days
i
had
the
green
man
in
the
cut
your
father
often
enough
gave
us
a
toon
on
his
fiddle
a
rare
good
fiddler
he
was
too
give
us
a
song
now
for
old
times
sake
thyrza
found
herself
preparing
in
spite
of
herself
she
trembled
violently
and
her
heart
beat
with
a
strange
pain
she
heard
the
chairman
shout
her
name
the
sound
made
her
face
burn
what
shall
i
sing
she
whispered
distractedly
to
totty
whilst
all
eyes
were
turned
to
regard
her
a
penny
for
your
thoughts
it
was
the
one
song
she
knew
of
her
father
making
a
little
piece
in
the
form
of
a
dialogue
between
husband
and
wife
a
true
expression
of
the
life
of
working
folk
which
only
a
man
who
was
more
than
half
a
poet
could
have
shaped
the
seedy
youth
at
the
piano
was
equal
to
any
demand
for
accompaniment
totty
hummed
the
air
to
him
and
he
had
his
chords
ready
without
delay
thyrza
raised
her
face
and
began
to
sing
yes
it
was
different
enough
from
anything
that
had
come
before
her
pure
sweet
tones
touched
the
hearers
profoundly
not
a
foot
stirred
at
the
second
verse
she
had
grown
in
confidence
and
rose
more
boldly
to
the
upper
notes
at
the
end
she
was
singing
her
best
better
than
she
had
ever
sung
at
home
better
than
she
thought
she
could
sing
the
applause
that
followed
was
tumultuous
by
this
time
much
beer
had
been
consumed
the
audience
was
in
a
mood
for
enjoying
good
things
something
like
old
girl
cried
totty
clapping
her
on
the
back
a
drink
out
of
my
glass
it
only
it
hurt
you
this
is
jolly
ai
it
a
lark
to
be
alive
the
girl
who
had
sung
of
looked
across
the
table
with
eyes
in
which
jealousy
strove
against
admiration
there
were
remarks
aside
between
the
men
with
regard
to
thyrza
personal
appearance
she
must
sing
again
they
were
not
going
to
be
left
with
hungry
ears
after
a
song
like
that
thyrza
still
suffered
from
the
sense
that
she
was
doing
wrong
but
the
praise
was
so
sweet
to
her
sweeter
she
thought
than
anything
she
had
ever
known
she
longed
to
repeat
her
triumph
totty
named
another
song
the
faint
resistance
was
overcome
and
again
the
room
hushed
itself
every
hearer
spellbound
it
was
a
voice
well
worthy
of
cultivation
excellent
in
compass
with
rare
sweet
power
again
the
rapturous
applause
and
again
the
demand
for
more
another
she
should
not
refuse
them
only
one
more
and
they
would
be
content
and
a
third
time
she
sang
a
third
time
was
borne
upwards
on
clamour
i
go
she
whispered
the
time
only
just
after
ten
was
the
reply
soon
run
home
ten
oh
i
must
go
at
once
she
left
her
place
and
as
quickly
as
possible
made
her
way
through
the
crowd
just
at
the
door
she
saw
a
face
that
she
recognised
but
a
feeling
of
faintness
was
creeping
upon
her
and
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
desire
to
breathe
fresh
air
already
she
was
on
the
stairs
but
her
strength
suddenly
failed
she
felt
herself
falling
felt
herself
strongly
seized
then
lost
consciousness
she
came
to
herself
in
a
few
minutes
in
the
the
landlady
was
attending
to
her
and
the
door
had
been
shut
against
intruders
her
first
recognition
was
of
luke
ackroyd
say
anything
she
murmured
looking
at
him
imploringly
tell
lyddy
i
replied
ackroyd
drink
a
drop
and
you
be
all
right
i
see
you
home
you
feel
better
do
you
yes
she
felt
better
though
her
head
ached
miserably
soon
she
was
able
to
walk
and
longed
to
hasten
away
the
landlady
let
her
out
by
the
private
door
and
ackroyd
went
with
her
you
take
my
arm
he
said
speaking
very
gently
and
looking
into
her
face
with
eloquent
eyes
rare
and
glad
i
happened
to
be
there
i
heard
you
singing
from
downstairs
and
i
asked

all
right
but
of
course

the
kind
of
place
for
you
miss
trent
she
kept
silence
they
were
walking
through
a
quiet
street
where
the
only
light
came
from
the
ackroyd
presently
looked
again
into
her
face
you
come
out
he
asked
softly
mr
ackroyd
she
added
i

come
alone
it
is
better
to
tell
you
at
once
is
it
i
do
mind
with
my
sister

your
sister

it
i
shall
never
alter
my
mind

reason

he
asked
standing
still
she
looked
away
mean
that
that
i
could
never
marry
you
say
that
you
do
knew
what
i
felt
when
i
heard
you
singing

you
heard
any
harm
against
me
thyrza
i
have
always
been
as
steady
a
fellow
as
i
ought
to
be
but
that
was
before
i
came
to
know
you
it
no
good
whatever

i
ca
give
up
hope
why
a
man

anything
for
half
a
kind
word
from
you
thyrza
he
lowered
his
voice
there
is
anyone
else
is
there
she
was
silent
do
mean
that
good
god
i
do
know
what
become
of
me
if
i
think
of
that
the
only
thing
i
care
to
live
for
is
the
hope
of
having
you
for
my
wife
you
must
hope
ackroyd
you
find
someone
much
better
for
you
than
me
but
i
ca
stop
it
so
late
and
my
head
aches
so
do
let
me
go
please
he
made
an
effort
over
himself
the
nearest
lamp
showed
him
that
she
was
very
pale
one
word
thyrza
is
there
really
any
one
else
but
that
does
alter
it
she
walked
quickly
on
ackroyd
with
a
great
sigh
of
relief
went
on
by
her
side
they
came
out
into
lambeth
walk
where
the
market
was
as
noisy
as
ever
the
shops
lit
up
the
stalls
flaring
with
naphtha
lamps
the
odour
of
fried
fish
everywhere
predominant
he
led
her
through
the
crowd
and
a
short
distance
into
her
own
street
then
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
said
ackroyd
thank
you
for
bringing
me
back
you
be
friends
with
me
and
lyddy
come
out
with
her
ca
promise
chapter
v
a
land
of
twilight
it
happened
that
jarmey
the
landlady
of
the
house
in
which
the
sisters
lived
had
business
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
albert
and
chanced
to
exchange
a
word
with
an
acquaintance
who
had
just
come
away
after
hearing
thyrza
sing
returning
home
she
found
lydia
at
the
door
anxiously
and
impatiently
waiting
for
appearance
the
news
of
course
was
at
once
communicated
with
moral
reflections
wherein
jarmey
excelled
not
five
minutes
later
and
whilst
the
two
were
still
talking
in
the
passage
the
front
door
opened
and
thyrza
came
in
lydia
turned
and
went
upstairs
thyrza
entering
the
room
sought
her
sister
face
it
had
an
angry
look
for
a
moment
lydia
did
not
speak
the
other
laying
aside
her
hat
said
sorry
i
so
late
lyddy
have
you
been
her
sister
asked
in
a
voice
which
strove
to
command
itself
thyrza
could
not
tell
the
whole
truth
at
once
though
she
knew
it
would
have
to
be
confessed
eventually
indeed
whether
or
no
discovery
came
from
other
sources
all
would
eventually
be
told
of
her
own
free
will
she
might
fear
at
the
moment
but
in
the
end
kept
no
secret
from
lydia
been
about
with
totty
she
said
averting
her
face
as
she
drew
off
her
cotton
gloves
you
have
you
been
singing
at
a
lydia
was
too
upset
to
note
the
paleness
of
thyrza
face
which
at
another
moment
would
have
elicited
anxious
question
she
was
deeply
hurt
that
thyrza
made
so
little
account
of
her
wishes
jealous
of
the
influence
of
totty
nancarrow
stirred
with
apprehensions
as
powerful
as
a
mother
on
the
other
hand
it
was
thyrza
nature
to
shrink
into
coldness
before
angry
words
she
suffered
intensely
when
the
voice
which
was
of
wont
so
affectionate
turned
to
severity
but
she
could
not
excuse
herself
till
the
storm
was
over
and
it
was
most
often
from
the
elder
girl
that
the
first
words
of
reconcilement
came
your
totty
nancarrow
lydia
went
on
with
no
check
upon
her
tongue
i
tell
you
what
come
of
going
about
with
her
what
next
i
should
like
to
know
if
you
go
on
and
sing
in
a
i
do
know
what
you
wo
do
i
shall
never
trust
you
out
by
yourself
again
you
sha
go
out
at
night
at
all
that
about
it
no
right
to
speak
to
me
like
that
lydia
thyrza
replied
with
indignation
the
excitement
and
the
fainting
fit
had
strung
her
nerves
painfully
and
for
all
her
repentance
the
echo
of
applause
was
still
very
sweet
in
her
ears
this
vehement
reproach
caused
a
little
injury
to
her
pride
does
depend
on
you
whether
i
go
out
or
not
not
a
child
and
i
can
take
care
of
myself
i
have
done
nothing
wrong
have
and
you
know
you
have
you
knew
i
should
have
let
you
go
near
such
a
place
you
know
how
i
begged
you
not
to
go
with
totty
nancarrow
and
how
you
promised
me
you
would
be
led
into
no
harm
i
shall
never
be
able
to
trust
you
again
you
only
a
child
you
show
it
and
in
future
you
do
as
i
tell
you
thyrza
caught
up
her
hat
not
going
to
stop
here
whilst
you
in
such
a
bad
temper
she
said
in
a
trembling
voice
find
that
is
the
way
to
make
me
do
as
you
wish
she
stepped
to
the
door
lydia
frightened
sprang
forward
and
barred
the
way
and
sit
down
thyrza
me
go
what
right
have
you
to
stop
me
then
both
were
silent
at
the
same
moment
they
became
aware
that
a
common
incident
of
saturday
night
was
occurring
had
got
thus
far
on
their
way
home
the
wife
shrill
tongue
in
the
street
below
a
man
and
a
nagging
woman
running
over
every
scale
of
scurrility
and
striking
every
note
of
ingenious
malice
the
man
was
at
length
worked
to
a
pitch
of
frenzy
and
then
thud
thud
mingled
with
objurgations
and
shrill
yells
fury
little
short
of
murderous
was
familiar
enough
to
dwellers
in
this
region
but
that
woman
tongue
had
struck
shame
into
lydia
she
could
not
speak
another
angry
word
take
your
hat
off
she
said
quietly
moving
away
a
little
from
the
door
her
cheeks
burned
and
she
quivered
in
the
subsidence
of
her
temper
her
sister
did
not
obey
but
unable
to
stand
longer
she
went
to
a
chair
at
a
distance
the
uproar
in
the
street
continued
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
by
degrees
passed
on
the
voice
of
the
woman
shrieking
foul
abuse
till
remoteness
stifled
it
lydia
forced
herself
to
keep
silence
from
good
or
ill
it
was
no
use
speaking
the
thoughts
she
had
till
morning
thyrza
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
she
was
so
miserable
her
heart
had
sunk
so
low
that
tears
would
have
come
had
she
not
forced
them
back
more
than
once
of
late
she
had
known
this
mood
in
which
life
lay
about
her
barren
and
weary
she
was
very
young
to
suffer
that
oppression
of
the
it
was
the
penalty
she
paid
for
her
birthright
of
heart
and
mind
by
midnight
they
were
lying
side
by
side
but
no
had
passed
between
them
when
thyrza
gentle
breathing
told
that
she
slept
lydia
still
lay
with
open
eyes
watching
the
flicker
of
the
street
lamp
upon
the
ceiling
hearing
the
sounds
that
came
of
mirth
or
brutality
in
streets
near
and
far
she
did
not
suffer
in
the
same
way
as
her
sister
as
soon
as
she
had
gently
touched
thyrza
unconscious
hand
love
came
upon
her
with
its
warm
solace
but
her
trouble
was
deep
and
she
looked
into
the
future
with
many
doubts
the
past
she
could
scarcely
deem
other
than
happy
though
a
stranger
would
have
thought
it
sad
enough
her
mother
she
well
remembered
a
face
pale
and
sweet
like
thyrza
the
eyes
that
have
their
sad
beauty
from
foresight
of
death
her
father
lived
only
a
year
longer
then
she
and
the
little
one
passed
into
the
charge
of
boddy
who
was
paid
a
certain
small
sum
by
trent
employers
in
consideration
of
the
death
by
accident
then
came
the
commencement
of
boddy
misfortunes
his
shop
and
house
were
burnt
down
he
lost
his
limb
in
an
endeavour
to
save
his
property
he
lost
his
wife
in
consequence
of
the
shock
dreary
things
for
the
memory
yet
they
did
not
weigh
upon
lydia
she
was
so
happily
endowed
that
her
mind
selected
and
dwelt
on
sunny
hours
on
kind
looks
and
words
which
her
strong
heart
cherished
unassailably
on
the
mutual
charities
which
sorrow
had
begotten
rather
than
on
the
sorrow
itself
above
all
the
growing
love
of
her
dear
one
of
her
to
whom
she
was
both
mother
and
sister
had
strengthened
her
against
every
trouble
yet
of
late
this
strongest
passion
of
her
life
had
become
a
source
of
grave
anxieties
as
often
as
circumstance
caused
her
to
look
beyond
her
contentment
thyrza
was
so
beautiful
and
it
seemed
to
her
so
weak
always
dreaming
of
something
beyond
and
above
the
life
which
was
her
lot
so
deficient
in
the
practical
qualities
which
that
life
demanded
at
moments
lydia
saw
her
responsibility
in
a
light
which
alarmed
her
they
worked
at
a
factory
as
that
is
to
say
they
finished
hats
by
sewing
in
the
lining
putting
on
the
bands
and
the
like
in
the
busy
season
they
could
average
together
wages
of
about
a
pound
a
week
at
dull
times
they
earned
less
and
very
occasionally
had
to
support
themselves
for
a
week
or
two
without
employment
since
the
age
of
fourteen
lydia
herself
had
received
help
from
no
one
from
sixteen
she
had
lived
in
lodgings
with
thyrza
independent
boddy
was
then
no
longer
able
to
do
more
than
supply
his
own
needs
for
things
had
grown
worse
with
him
from
year
to
year
lydia
occasionally
found
jobs
for
her
free
hours
and
she
had
never
yet
wanted
she
was
strong
her
health
had
scarcely
ever
given
her
a
day
uneasiness
there
never
came
to
her
a
fear
lest
bread
should
fail
but
thyrza
could
not
take
life
as
she
did
it
was
not
enough
for
that
imaginative
nature
to
toil
drearily
day
after
day
and
year
after
year
just
for
the
sake
of
earning
a
livelihood
in
a
month
she
would
be
seventeen
it
was
too
true
as
she
had
said
that
she
was
no
longer
a
child
what
might
happen
if
the
elder
sister
influence
came
to
an
end
thyrza
loved
her
how
lydia
would
have
laughed
at
anyone
who
hinted
that
the
love
could
ever
weaken
but
it
was
not
a
guard
against
every
danger
it
was
inevitable
that
lydia
should
have
hoped
that
her
sister
might
marry
early
and
one
man
she
knew
in
whom
she
scarcely
could
have
told
you
why
her
confidence
was
so
strong
that
she
would
freely
have
entrusted
him
with
thyrza
fate
thyrza
could
not
bring
herself
to
think
of
him
as
a
husband
it
was
with
ackroyd
that
lydia
thoughts
were
busy
as
she
lay
wakeful
before
she
had
not
pondered
so
continuously
on
what
she
knew
of
him
for
some
two
years
he
had
been
an
acquaintance
through
the
bowers
and
she
had
felt
glad
when
it
was
plain
that
he
sought
thyrza
society
she
had
said
to
herself
like
him
and
feel
that
he
is
to
be
relied
upon
stories
to
be
sure
had
reached
her
ears
something
of
an
for
conviviality
but
she
had
confidence
she
seemed
called
upon
to
review
all
her
impressions
why
nothing
new
had
happened
she
longed
for
sleep
but
it
only
came
when
dawn
was
white
upon
the
blind
when
it
was
time
to
rise
neither
spoke
lydia
prepared
the
breakfast
as
usual
it
seemed
quite
natural
that
she
should
do
nearly
all
the
work
of
the
home
and
they
sat
down
to
it
cheerlessly
since
daybreak
a
mist
had
crept
over
the
sky
it
thinned
the
sunlight
to
a
suffusion
of
grey
and
gold
within
the
house
there
was
the
silence
of
sunday
morning
the
street
was
still
save
for
the
jodeling
of
a
milkman
as
he
wheeled
his
clattering
cans
from
house
to
house
in
that
london
on
the
other
side
of
thames
known
to
these
girls
with
scarcely
less
of
vagueness
than
to
simple
dwellers
in
country
towns
the
air
was
foretaste
of
holiday
the
martyrs
of
the
season
and
they
who
do
the
world
cleaner
work
knew
that
rest
was
near
spoke
at
breakfast
of
the
shore
and
the
mountain
even
to
lydia
weary
after
her
short
sleep
and
unwontedly
dejected
there
came
a
wish
that
it
were
possible
to
quit
the
streets
for
but
one
day
and
sit
somewhere
apart
under
the
open
sky
it
was
not
often
that
so
fantastic
a
dream
visited
her
in
dressing
thyrza
had
left
her
hair
unbraided
lydia
always
did
that
for
her
when
the
table
was
cleared
the
former
took
up
a
which
she
bought
every
week
and
made
a
show
of
reading
lydia
went
about
her
accustomed
tasks
presently
she
took
a
brush
and
comb
and
went
behind
her
sister
chair
she
began
to
unloosen
the
rough
coils
in
which
the
golden
hair
was
pinned
together
it
was
always
a
joy
to
her
to
bathe
her
hands
in
the
warm
soft
torrent
with
delicate
care
she
combed
out
every
intricacy
and
brushed
the
ordered
tresses
till
the
light
gleamed
on
their
smooth
surface
then
with
skilful
fingers
she
wove
the
braid
tying
it
with
a
blue
ribbon
so
that
the
ends
hung
loose
the
task
completed
it
was
her
custom
to
bend
over
the
little
head
and
snatch
an
inverted
kiss
always
a
moment
of
laughter
this
morning
she
omitted
that
she
was
moving
sadly
away
when
she
noticed
that
the
face
turned
a
little
a
very
little
it
right
she
asked
keeping
her
eyes
down
think
so
it
does
matter
she
drew
near
again
as
if
to
inspect
her
work
perhaps
there
was
a
slight
lack
of
smoothness
over
the
temple
she
touched
the
spot
with
her
fingers
are
you
so
unkind
to
me
thyrza
the
words
had
come
involuntarily
the
voice
shook
as
they
were
spoken
do
mean
to
be
lyddy
you
know
i
do
you
do
things
that
you
know
make
me
angry
i
and
i
could
bear
to
think
of
you
going
to
that
place
i
ought
to
have
spoke
in
a
different
way
told
you
i
been
singing
jarmey
i
very
glad
she
did
it
does
seem
any
harm
to
you
thyrza
but
it
does
to
me
dear
have
you
ever
sung
at
such
places
before
thyrza
shook
her
head
you
promise
me
never
to
go
there
again
do
want
to
go
but
i
get
no
harm
they
were
very
pleased
with
my
singing
annie
west
was
there
and
several
other
girls
why
do
you
make
so
much
of
it
lyddy
i
older
than
you
thyrza
and
if
you
only
trust
me
and
do
as
i
wish
you
see
some
day
that
i
was
right
i
know
you
a
good
girl
i
do
think
a
wrong
thought
ever
came
into
your
head
it
is
that
it
because
you
ca
go
about
the
streets
and
into
without
hearing
bad
things
and
seeing
bad
people
i
want
to
keep
you
away
from
everything
that
is
homelike
and
quiet
i
want
you
to
love
me
more
than
anyone
else
do
lyddy
i
do
dear
it
only
that
i
do
know
how
it
is
i
discontented
there
never
any
change
how
can
you
be
so
happy
day
after
day
i
love
to
be
with
you
but
if
we
could
go
and
live
somewhere
else
i
should
like
to
see
a
new
place
i
been
reading
there
about
the
seaside
what
it
must
be
like
i
want
to
know
things
you
do
understand
me
think
i
do
i
felt
a
little
the
same
when
i
heard
isaacs
and
her
daughter
talking
about
margate
yesterday
but
we
shall
be
better
off
some
day
see
if
we
are
try
your
best
not
to
think
about
those
things
suppose
you
ask
grail
to
lend
you
a
book
to
read
i
met
grail
downstairs
last
night
and
she
asked
if
we
go
down
and
have
tea
i
ca
because
mary
coming
but
you
might
and
sure
he
lend
you
something
nice
if
you
asked
him
do
think
i
durst
he
always
sits
so
quiet
and
he
such
a
queer
man
he
is
rather
queer
but
he
speaks
very
kind
see
but
you
must
speak
so
cross
to
me
if
i
do
wrong
lyddy
i
felt
as
if
i
should
like
to
go
away
some
time
when
you
did
know
i
did
really
lydia
gazed
at
her
anxiously
do
think
you
ever
have
the
heart
to
do
that
thyrza
she
said
in
a
low
voice
she
shook
her
head
smiling
could
do
without
you
and
now
kiss
me
properly
like
you
always
do
lydia
stood
behind
the
chair
again
and
the
laughing
caress
was
exchanged
should
stay
thyrza
went
on
it
was
only
to
have
you
do
my
hair
i
do
so
like
to
feel
your
soft
hands
hands
great
coarse
things
just
look
she
took
one
of
thyrza
and
held
it
beside
her
own
the
difference
was
noticeable
enough
lydia
was
not
but
there
were
marks
on
it
of
all
the
rough
household
work
which
she
had
never
permitted
her
sister
to
do
thyrza
was
delicate
supple
beautiful
in
its
kind
as
her
face
do
care
she
said
laughing
a
good
soft
sleepy
hand
child
mean
it
always
makes
me
feel
dozy
when
it
doing
my
hair
there
was
no
more
cloud
between
them
the
morning
passed
on
with
sisterly
talk
lydia
had
wisely
refrained
from
exacting
promises
she
hoped
to
resume
the
subject
before
long
together
with
another
that
was
in
her
mind
thyrza
too
had
something
to
speak
of
but
could
not
bring
herself
to
it
as
yet
though
it
was
so
hot
they
had
to
keep
a
small
fire
for
cooking
the
dinner
this
meal
consisted
of
a
small
piece
of
steak
chosen
from
the
odds
and
ends
thrown
together
on
the
front
of
a
butcher
shop
and
a
few
potatoes
it
was
not
always
they
had
meat
yet
they
never
went
hungry
and
in
comparing
herself
with
others
she
knew
it
sometimes
made
lydia
a
little
unhappy
to
think
how
well
she
lived
then
began
the
unutterable
dreariness
of
a
sunday
afternoon
from
the
lower
part
of
the
house
sounded
the
notes
of
a
concertina
it
was
jarmey
who
played
he
had
the
habit
of
doing
so
whilst
half
asleep
between
dinner
and
tea
with
impartiality
he
passed
from
strains
of
popular
hymnody
to
the
familiar
ditties
of
the
music
hall
lavishing
on
each
an
excess
of
sentiment
he
shook
pathetically
on
top
notes
and
languished
on
final
chords
a
dolorous
music
the
milkman
came
along
the
street
he
was
followed
by
a
woman
who
wailed
then
the
concertina
once
more
possessed
the
stillness
few
pedestrians
were
abroad
the
greater
part
of
the
male
population
of
lambeth
slumbered
after
the
baked
joint
and
flagon
of
ale
yet
here
and
there
a
man
in
his
leaned
forth
despondently
from
a
window
or
sat
in
view
within
dozing
over
the
sunday
paper
a
rattling
of
light
wheels
drew
near
and
a
nasal
voice
cried
penny
a
lump
it
was
the
man
who
sold
he
came
to
a
stop
and
half
a
dozen
boys
gathered
about
his
truck
the
delicacy
was
dispensed
to
them
in
little
green
and
yellow
glasses
from
which
they
extracted
it
with
their
tongues
the
vendor
remained
for
a
few
minutes
then
on
again
with
his
sung
through
the
nose
next
came
a
sound
of
distressful
voices
whining
the
discords
of
a
mendicant
psalm
a
man
a
woman
and
two
small
children
crawled
along
the
street
their
eyes
surveyed
the
upper
windows
all
were
ragged
and
filthy
the
elders
bore
the
unmistakable
brand
of
the
and
the
children
were
visaged
like
debased
monkeys
occasionally
a
copper
fell
to
them
in
return
for
which
the
choragus
exclaimed
bless
yer
thyrza
sat
in
her
usual
place
by
the
window
now
reading
for
a
few
minutes
now
dreaming
lydia
had
some
stockings
to
be
darned
she
became
at
length
so
silent
that
her
sister
turned
to
look
at
her
her
head
had
dropped
forward
she
slumbered
for
a
few
minutes
then
started
to
consciousness
again
and
laughed
when
she
saw
thyrza
regarding
her
suppose
mary
be
here
directly
she
said
better
put
this
work
out
of
sight
and
as
she
began
to
spread
the
cloth
she
asked
you
do
whilst
we
at
chapel
thyrza
think
i
go
and
have
tea
with
grail
then
i
see
if
i
dare
ask
for
a
book
made
up
your
mind
not
to
go
out
was
something
i
wanted
to
tell
you
i
met
ackroyd
as
i
was
coming
home
last
night
i
told
him
i
could
come
out
alone
and
i
said
i
could
be
sure
whether
you
come
or
not
what
a
pity
returned
lydia
knew
i
was
going
to
chapel
afraid
he
wait
for
us
but
i
somehow
did
like
to
say
we
would
go
at
all
what
time
is
he
going
to
be
there
said
at
six
you
mind
just
running
out
and
telling
him
perhaps
you
be
going
past
with
mary
not
long
after
a
nice
job
you
give
me
remarked
lydia
with
a
half
smile
i
know
you
do
mind
it
lyddy
it
is
the
first
thing
done
for
me
it
was
said
with
so
much
that
lydia
could
not
but
laugh
should
like
it
much
better
if
you
go
yourself
she
replied
i
afraid
it
no
good
asking
a
hit
and
lyddy
i
told
ackroyd
that
it
would
always
be
the
same
he
understands
now
the
other
made
no
reply
wo
be
cross
about
it
dear
there
nothing
to
be
cross
about
but
i
very
sorry
the
explanation
passed
in
a
tone
of
less
earnestness
than
either
would
have
anticipated
they
did
not
look
at
each
other
and
they
dismissed
the
subject
as
soon
as
possible
then
came
two
rings
at
the
signifying
the
arrival
of
their
visitor
mary
bower
and
lydia
had
been
close
friends
for
four
or
five
years
yet
they
had
few
obvious
points
of
similarity
and
their
differences
were
marked
enough
the
latter
increased
for
mary
attached
herself
more
closely
to
religious
observances
whilst
lydia
continued
to
declare
with
native
frankness
that
she
could
not
feel
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
give
grave
attention
to
such
matters
mary
grieved
over
this
attitude
in
one
whose
goodness
of
heart
she
could
not
call
in
question
it
troubled
her
as
an
inconsequence
in
nature
she
cherished
a
purpose
of
converting
lydia
and
had
even
brought
herself
to
the
point
of
hoping
that
some
sorrow
might
befall
her
friend
nothing
of
too
sad
a
nature
but
still
a
grief
which
might
turn
her
thoughts
inward
yet
had
anything
of
the
kind
come
to
pass
mary
would
have
been
the
first
to
hasten
with
consolation
thyrza
went
downstairs
and
the
two
gossiped
as
tea
was
made
ready
mary
had
already
heard
of
the
incident
at
the
albert
such
a
piece
of
news
could
not
be
long
in
reaching
bower
she
wished
to
speak
of
it
yet
was
in
uncertainty
whether
lydia
had
already
been
told
the
latter
was
the
first
to
bring
forward
the
subject
quite
certain
she
ought
to
make
a
friend
of
that
girl
totty
mary
said
with
decision
must
insist
that
it
is
stopped
lydia
sha
do
any
good
that
way
replied
the
other
shaking
her
head
lost
my
temper
last
night
like
a
silly
and
of
course
only
harm
came
of
it
there
no
need
to
lose
your
temper
you
must
tell
her
she
to
speak
to
the
girl
again
and
there
an
end
of
it
too
old
for
that
dear
i
must
lead
her
by
kindness
or
i
ca
lead
her
at
all
i
do
think
though
she
ever
do
such
a
thing
as
that
again
i
know
what
a
temptation
it
was
she
does
sing
so
sweetly
but
she
wo
do
it
again
now
she
knows
how
i
think
about
it
mary
appeared
doubtful
given
a
suggestion
of
iniquity
and
it
was
her
instinct
rather
to
fear
than
to
hope
secretly
she
had
no
real
liking
for
thyrza
something
in
that
complex
nature
repelled
her
as
she
herself
had
said
was
not
easy
to
understand
but
she
did
understand
that
the
girl
essential
motives
were
of
a
kind
radically
at
enmity
with
her
own
thyrza
it
seemed
to
her
was
worldly
in
the
most
hopeless
way
be
sorry
for
it
if
you
not
firm
she
remarked
lydia
made
no
direct
reply
but
after
a
moment
musing
she
said
only
she
could
think
of
mr
ackroyd
she
had
not
yet
spoken
so
plainly
of
this
to
mary
the
latter
was
surprised
by
the
despondency
of
her
tone
i
thought
they
were
often
together
only
been
out
with
him
when
i
went
as
well
and
last
night
she
told
him
it
was
no
use
i
ca
say
i
sorry
to
hear
that
mary
replied
with
the
air
of
one
who
spoke
an
unpleasant
truth
not
mary
think
he
likely
to
do
her
every
bit
as
much
harm
as
totty
nancarrow
you
mean
mary
there
was
a
touch
of
indignation
in
voice
harm
can
ackroyd
do
to
thyrza
the
kind
of
harm
you
thinking
of
dear
but
if
i
had
a
sister
i
know
i
should
like
to
see
her
marry
ackroyd
he
got
no
religion
and
what
more
he
always
talking
against
religion
father
says
he
made
a
speech
last
week
at
that
place
in
westminster
bridge
road
where
the
atheists
have
their
meetings
i
do
deny
something
nice
about
him
but
i
would
trust
a
man
of
that
kind
lydia
delayed
her
words
a
little
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
table
her
forehead
was
knitted
ca
help
what
he
thinks
about
religion
she
replied
at
length
with
firmness
a
good
man
i
quite
sure
of
that
he
ca
be
good
if
he
does
his
best
to
ruin
people
souls
do
know
anything
about
that
mary
whatever
he
says
he
says
because
he
believes
it
and
thinks
it
right
why
there
grail
thinks
in
the
same
way
i
believe
at
all
events
he
never
goes
to
church
or
chapel
and
he
a
friend
of
mr
ackroyd
we
do
know
anything
about
mr
grail
do
know
much
but
it
quite
enough
to
talk
to
him
for
a
few
minutes
to
know
he
a
man
that
would
say
or
do
anything
wrong
must
be
a
wonderful
man
lydia
these
sunday
conversations
were
always
fruitful
of
trouble
mary
was
prepared
by
her
morning
and
afternoon
exercises
to
be
more
aggressive
and
uncompromising
than
usual
but
the
present
difficulty
appeared
a
graver
one
than
any
that
had
yet
risen
between
them
lydia
had
never
spoken
in
the
tone
which
marked
her
rejoinder
mary
it
as
if
you
could
put
faith
in
no
one
you
know
i
do
feel
the
same
as
you
do
about
religion
and
such
things
and
i
do
suppose
i
ever
shall
when
i
like
people
i
like
them
i
ask
what
they
believe
and
what
they
do
believe
we
better
not
talk
about
it
any
more
mary
face
assumed
rather
a
hard
look
as
you
like
my
dear
she
said
there
ensued
an
awkward
silence
which
lydia
at
length
broke
by
speech
on
some
wholly
different
subject
mary
with
difficulty
adapted
herself
to
the
change
tea
was
finished
rather
uncomfortably
it
was
six
lydia
hearing
the
hour
strike
knew
that
ackroyd
would
be
waiting
at
the
end
of
walnut
tree
walk
she
was
halting
between
a
desire
to
go
at
once
and
tell
him
that
they
could
not
come
and
a
disinclination
not
perhaps
very
clearly
explained
the
minutes
went
on
it
seemed
to
be
decided
for
her
that
he

church
bells
began
to
sound
mary
rose
and
put
on
her
hat
then
taking
up
the
devotional
books
she
had
with
her
offered
her
hand
as
if
to
say
said
lydia
in
surprise
going
with
you
did
suppose
you
would
the
other
returned
quietly
have
you
had
tea
with
me
mary
had
not
now
to
learn
that
her
friend
held
a
promise
inviolable
her
surprise
would
have
been
great
if
lydia
had
allowed
her
to
go
forth
alone
she
smiled
there
be
nice
singing
lydia
asked
as
she
prepared
herself
quickly
do
really
like
the
singing
at
all
events
mary
the
other
shook
her
head
sadly
they
left
the
house
and
turned
towards
kennington
road
before
lydia
had
gone
half
a
dozen
steps
she
saw
that
ackroyd
was
waiting
at
the
end
of
the
street
she
felt
a
pang
of
it
was
wrong
of
her
to
have
allowed
him
to
stand
in
miserable
uncertainty
all
this
time
she
ought
to
have
gone
out
at
six
in
a
low
voice
she
said
to
her
companion
ackroyd
i
want
just
to
speak
a
word
to
him
if
you
go
on
when
we
get
up
i
soon
overtake
you
mary
acquiesced
in
silence
lydia
approaching
saw
disappointment
on
the
young
man
face
he
raised
his
hat
to
her
an
unwonted
attention
in
these
parts
and
she
gave
him
her
hand
going
to
chapel
she
said
playfully
he
had
a
sudden
hope
your
sister
come
out
ackroyd
she
ca
she
having
tea
with
mrs
grail
he
looked
down
the
street
lydia
was
impelled
to
say
earnestly
time
perhaps
thyrza
is
very
young
yet
ackroyd
she
thinks
of
such
different
things
does
she
think
of
he
asked
rather
gloomily
mean
she
she
must
get
older
and
know
you
better
mary
bower
is
waiting
for
me
she
ran
on
and
ackroyd
sauntered
away
without
a
glance
after
her
chapter
vi
disinherited
when
thyrza
left
the
two
at
tea
and
went
downstairs
she
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
front
parlour
on
the
ground
floor
the
room
which
she
entered
was
but
dimly
lighted
thick
curtains
encroached
upon
each
side
of
the
narrow
window
which
was
also
shadowed
above
by
a
valance
with
long
tassels
whilst
in
front
of
it
stood
a
table
with
a
great
pot
of
flowering
musk
the
atmosphere
was
close
with
the
odour
of
the
plant
blended
the
musty
air
which
comes
from
old
and
neglected
furniture
grail
gilbert
grail
mother
was
an
old
lady
with
an
unusual
dislike
for
the
upset
of
household
cleaning
and
as
her
prejudice
like
that
of
most
men
tended
in
the
same
direction
this
which
they
used
in
common
had
known
little
disturbance
since
they
entered
it
a
year
and
a
half
ago
formerly
they
had
occupied
a
house
in
battersea
it
was
given
up
on
the
death
of
gilbert
sister
and
these
lodgings
taken
in
walnut
tree
walk
a
prominent
object
in
the
room
was
a
bookcase
some
six
feet
high
quite
full
of
books
most
of
them
of
shabby
exterior
they
were
gilbert
purchases
at
stalls
during
the
past
fifteen
years
their
variety
indicated
a
mind
of
liberal
intelligence
works
of
history
and
biography
predominated
but
poetry
and
fiction
were
also
represented
on
the
shelves
odd
volumes
of
expensive
publications
looked
forth
plaintively
here
and
there
and
many
periodical
issues
stood
unbound
another
case
a
small
one
with
glass
doors
contained
literature
of
another
order
some
thirty
volumes
which
had
belonged
to
father
and
were
now
his
mother
peculiar
study
they
were
translations
of
sundry
works
of
swedenborg
and
productions
put
forth
by
the
church
of
the
new
jerusalem
grail
was
a
member
of
that
church
she
occasionally
visited
a
in
brixton
but
for
the
most
part
was
satisfied
with
conning
the
treatises
of
the
mystic
by
preference
that
on
and
hell
which
she
read
in
the
first
english
edition
an
old
copy
in
boards
much
worn
she
was
a
woman
not
without
dignity
as
she
rose
to
receive
thyrza
and
guided
her
to
a
comfortable
seat
her
voice
was
habitually
subdued
to
the
limit
of
audibleness
she
spoke
with
precision
and
in
language
very
free
from
vulgarisms
either
of
thought
or
phrase
her
taste
had
always
been
for
a
life
she
dreaded
gossipers
and
only
left
the
house
when
it
was
absolutely
necessary
then
going
forth
closely
veiled
with
the
landlady
she
held
no
more
intercourse
than
arose
from
the
weekly
payment
of
rent
the
other
lodgers
in
the
house
only
saw
her
by
chance
on
rare
occasions
her
son
left
home
and
returned
with
much
regularity
he
also
seeming
to
desire
privacy
above
all
things
jarmey
had
at
first
been
disposed
to
take
this
reserve
somewhat
ill
when
she
knocked
at
door
on
some
paltry
excuse
for
seeing
the
inside
of
the
room
and
found
that
the
old
lady
exchanged
brief
words
with
her
on
the
threshold
she
wondered
who
these
people
might
be
who
thought
themselves
too
good
for
wonted
neighbourship
in
time
however
her
feeling
changed
and
she
gave
everybody
to
understand
that
her
lodgers
were
of
the
highest
respectability
inmates
such
as
did
not
fall
to
the
lot
of
every
landlady
gilbert
was
surprised
when
of
her
own
motion
his
mother
made
overtures
to
the
sisters
who
lived
at
the
top
of
the
house
neither
lydia
nor
thyrza
was
at
first
disposed
to
respond
very
warmly
they
agreed
that
the
old
lady
was
doubtless
very
respectable
but
at
the
same
time
decidedly
queer
in
her
way
of
speaking
but
during
the
past
few
months
they
had
overcome
this
reluctance
and
were
now
on
a
certain
footing
of
intimacy
with
grail
who
made
it
no
secret
that
she
took
great
interest
in
thyrza
thyrza
always
entered
the
with
a
feeling
of
awe
the
dim
light
the
old
lady
low
voice
above
all
the
books
in
her
eyes
a
remarkable
library
impressed
her
strongly
if
grail
himself
were
present
he
was
invariably
reading
thyrza
held
him
profoundly
learned
a
judgment
confirmed
by
his
mother
way
of
speaking
of
him
for
grail
regarded
her
son
with
distinct
reverence
he
in
turn
was
tenderly
respectful
to
her
they
did
not
know
what
it
was
to
exchange
an
unkind
or
an
impatient
word
thyrza
liked
especially
to
have
tea
here
on
sunday
the
appointments
of
the
table
seemed
to
her
luxurious
for
the
was
uniform
and
of
pretty
pattern
and
simple
little
dainties
of
a
kind
new
to
her
were
generally
forthcoming
moreover
from
her
entrance
to
her
she
was
flattered
by
the
pleasantest
attentions
the
only
other
table
at
which
she
sometimes
sat
as
a
guest
was
bower
between
the
shopkeeper
gross
and
the
kindness
of
grail
there
was
a
broad
distinction
and
thyrza
was
very
ready
to
appreciate
it
for
she
was
sensible
of
refinements
numberless
little
personal
delicacies
distinguished
her
from
the
average
girl
of
her
class
and
even
from
lydia
the
meals
which
she
and
her
sister
took
in
their
own
room
might
be
ever
so
poor
they
were
always
served
with
a
modest
grace
which
perhaps
would
not
have
marked
them
if
it
had
depended
upon
lydia
alone
in
this
respect
as
in
many
others
thyrza
had
repaid
her
sister
devotion
with
subtle
influences
tending
to
a
comely
life
once
when
she
had
gone
down
alone
to
have
tea
she
said
to
lydia
on
her
return
they
treat
me
as
if
i
was
a
lady
and
it
was
spoken
with
the
simple
satisfaction
which
was
one
of
her
charming
traits
till
quite
lately
gilbert
had
scarcely
conversed
with
her
at
all
when
he
broke
his
habitual
silence
he
addressed
himself
to
lydia
if
he
did
speak
to
the
younger
girl
it
was
with
studied
courtesy
and
kindness
but
he
seemed
unable
to
overcome
a
sort
of
shyness
with
which
she
had
troubled
him
since
the
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
it
was
noticeable
in
his
manner
this
evening
when
he
shook
hands
with
a
murmured
word
or
two
thyrza
however
appeared
a
little
less
timid
than
usual
she
just
met
his
look
and
in
a
questioning
way
which
he
could
not
understand
at
the
time
the
truth
was
thyrza
wondered
whether
he
had
heard
of
her
escapade
of
the
night
before
she
tried
to
read
his
expression
searching
for
any
hint
of
disapproval
the
easy
chair
was
always
given
to
her
when
she
entered
so
seldom
she
sat
on
anything
easier
than
the
stiff
seats
of
her
own
room
that
this
always
seemed
luxurious
by
degrees
she
had
permitted
herself
to
lean
back
in
it
she
did
so
want
lyddy
to
know
what
it
was
like
to
sit
in
that
chair
but
it
had
never
yet
been
possible
to
effect
an
exchange
it
might
have
offended
grail
a
thing
on
no
account
to
be
risked
has
mary
bower
to
tea
she
said
on
her
arrival
this
evening
going
to
chapel
you
do
mind
me
coming
alone
mrs
grail
never
anything
but
welcome
my
dear
murmured
the
old
lady
pressing
the
little
hand
in
both
her
own
tea
was
soon
ready
grail
talked
with
pleasant
continuousness
as
usual
she
had
fallen
upon
reminiscences
and
spoke
of
lambeth
as
she
had
known
it
when
a
girl
it
was
her
birthplace
and
through
life
she
had
never
strayed
far
away
she
regarded
the
growth
of
population
the
crowding
of
mean
houses
where
open
spaces
used
to
be
the
whole
change
of
times
in
fact
as
deplorable
one
would
have
fancied
from
her
descriptions
that
the
lambeth
of
sixty
years
ago
was
a
delightful
rustic
village
after
tea
thyrza
resumed
the
low
chair
and
folded
her
hands
full
of
contentment
grail
took
the
from
the
room
and
was
absent
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
thyrza
left
alone
with
the
man
who
for
her
embodied
so
many
mysteries
let
her
eyes
stray
over
the
bookshelves
she
felt
it
very
unlikely
that
any
book
there
would
be
within
the
compass
of
her
understanding
doubtless
they
dealt
with
the
secrets
of
learning
the
strange
high
things
for
which
her
awed
imagination
had
no
name
gilbert
had
seated
himself
in
a
shadowed
corner
his
face
was
bent
downwards
just
when
thyrza
was
about
to
put
some
timid
question
with
regard
to
the
books
he
looked
at
her
and
said
you
ever
go
to
westminster
abbey
the
intellectual
hunger
of
his
face
was
softened
he
did
not
smile
but
kept
a
mild
gravity
of
expression
which
showed
that
he
had
a
pleasure
in
the
girl
proximity
when
he
had
spoken
he
stroked
his
forehead
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
a
nervous
action
never
been
inside
thyrza
made
answer
is
there
to
see
the
place
you
know
where
great
men
have
been
buried
for
hundreds
of
years
i
should
like
if
i
could
to
spend
a
little
time
there
every
day
you
see
the
graves
thyrza
asked
many
and
on
the
stones
you
read
who
they
were
that
lie
there
there
are
the
graves
of
kings
and
of
men
much
greater
than
kings
than
kings
who
were
they
mr
grail
she
had
rested
her
elbow
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
her
fingers
just
touched
her
chin
she
regarded
him
with
a
gaze
of
deep
curiosity
who
wrote
books
he
answered
with
a
slight
smile
thyrza
dropped
her
eyes
in
her
thought
of
books
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
any
special
interest
could
attach
to
the
people
who
wrote
them
indeed
she
had
perhaps
never
asked
herself
how
printed
matter
came
into
existence
even
among
the
crowd
of
average
readers
we
know
how
commonly
a
book
will
be
run
through
without
a
glance
at
its
gilbert
continued
always
come
away
from
the
abbey
with
fresh
courage
if
i
tired
and
out
of
spirits
i
go
there
and
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
dare
waste
a
minute
of
the
time
when
i
free
to
try
and
learn
something
it
was
a
strange
impulse
that
made
him
speak
in
this
way
to
an
untaught
child
with
those
who
were
far
more
likely
to
understand
him
he
was
the
most
reticent
of
men
you
know
a
great
deal
grail
thyrza
said
with
surprise
looking
again
at
the
bookshelves
must
think
that
i
had
very
little
teaching
when
i
was
a
lad
and
ever
since
i
had
very
little
either
of
time
or
means
to
teach
myself
if
i
only
knew
those
few
books
well
it
would
be
something
but
there
are
some
of
them
i
never
got
to
yet
books
thyrza
exclaimed
i
never
thought
anybody
had
so
many
before
i
came
into
this
room
should
like
you
to
see
the
library
at
the
british
museum
every
book
that
is
published
in
england
is
sent
there
there
a
large
room
where
people
sit
and
study
any
book
they
like
all
day
long
and
day
after
day
think
what
a
life
that
must
be
are
rich
people
i
suppose
thyrza
remarked
have
to
work
for
their
living
rich
all
of
them
but
they
have
to
work
with
their
hands
he
became
silent
in
his
last
words
there
was
a
little
bitterness
thyrza
glanced
at
him
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
presence
and
his
face
had
the
wonted
look
of
trouble
kept
under
then
grail
returned
she
sat
down
near
thyrza
and
after
a
little
more
of
her
pleasant
talk
said
turning
to
her
son
you
find
something
to
read
us
gilbert
he
thought
for
a
moment
then
reached
down
a
book
of
biographies
writing
of
a
popular
colour
not
above
thyrza
understanding
it
contained
a
life
of
sir
thomas
more
or
rather
a
pleasant
story
founded
upon
his
life
with
much
about
his
daughter
margaret
that
do
nicely
was
grail
opinion
he
began
with
a
word
or
two
of
explanation
to
thyrza
then
entered
upon
the
narrative
as
soon
as
the
proposal
was
made
thyrza
face
had
lighted
up
with
pleasure
she
listened
intently
leaning
a
little
forward
in
her
chair
her
hands
folded
together
gilbert
if
he
raised
his
eyes
from
the
page
did
not
look
at
her
grail
interrupted
once
or
twice
with
a
question
or
a
comment
the
reading
was
good
gilbert
voice
gave
life
to
description
and
conversation
and
supplied
an
interest
even
where
the
writer
was
in
danger
of
growing
dull
when
the
end
was
reached
thyrza
recovered
herself
with
the
sigh
which
follows
strained
attention
but
she
was
not
in
a
mood
to
begin
conversation
again
her
mind
had
got
something
to
work
upon
it
would
keep
her
awake
far
into
the
night
with
a
succession
of
pictures
what
a
world
was
that
of
which
a
glimpse
had
been
given
her
here
indeed
was
something
remote
from
her
tedious
life
her
brain
was
full
of
vague
glories
of
the
figures
of
kings
and
queens
of
courtiers
and
fair
ladies
of
things
nobly
said
and
done
and
her
heart
throbbed
with
indignation
at
wrongs
greater
than
any
she
had
ever
imagined
when
it
had
all
happened
she
knew
not
surely
very
long
ago
but
the
names
she
knew
chelsea
lambeth
the
tower
these
gave
a
curiously
fantastic
reality
to
the
fairy
tale
and
one
thing
she
saw
with
uttermost
distinctness
that
boat
going
down
the
stream
of
thames
and
the
dear
dreadful
head
dropped
into
it
from
the
arch
above
she
would
go
and
stand
on
the
bridge
and
think
of
it
ah
she
must
tell
lyddy
all
that
better
still
she
must
read
it
to
her
she
found
courage
to
say
you
spare
that
book
grail
could
you
lend
it
me
for
a
day
or
two
i
be
very
careful
with
it
shall
be
very
glad
to
lend
it
you
gilbert
answered
his
voice
changed
somehow
from
that
in
which
he
usually
spoke
she
received
it
from
him
and
held
it
on
her
lap
with
both
hands
she
would
not
look
into
it
till
alone
in
her
room
and
having
secured
it
she
did
not
wish
to
stay
longer
already
grail
said
seeing
her
rise
be
back
very
soon
was
the
reply
think
i
better
go
now
she
shook
hands
with
both
of
them
and
they
heard
her
run
up
the
stairs
mother
and
son
sat
in
silence
for
some
minutes
gilbert
had
taken
another
book
and
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
it
grail
had
a
face
of
meditation
occasionally
she
looked
upwards
as
though
on
the
track
of
some
memory
which
she
strove
to
make
clear
she
began
at
length
suggestively
he
raised
his
eyes
and
regarded
her
in
an
absent
way
been
trying
for
a
long
time
to
remember
what
that
child
face
reminded
me
of
every
time
i
see
her
i
make
sure
i
seen
someone
like
her
before
and
now
i
think
i
got
it
gilbert
was
used
to
a
stream
of
amusing
fancifulness
in
his
mother
analysis
and
resemblances
were
dear
to
her
possibly
the
biblical
theories
which
she
had
imbibed
were
in
some
degree
answerable
for
the
characteristic
who
does
she
remind
you
of
he
asked
somebody
whose
name
i
ca
think
of
you
remember
the
school
in
lambeth
road
where
lizzie
used
to
go
she
referred
to
a
time
years
gone
by
when
sister
was
a
child
he
nodded
was
green
school
you
know
and
soon
after
lizzie
began
to
go
there
was
an
assistant
teacher
taken
on
now
can
you
think
what
her
name
was
you
must
remember
that
lizzie
used
to
walk
home
along
with
her
almost
every
day
miss
miss
oh
dear
me
what
that
name
gilbert
smiled
and
shook
his
head
ca
help
you
mother
i
do
even
remember
any
such
thing
a
poor
memory
you
have
in
ordinary
things
gilbert
i
wonder
at
it
with
your
mind
for
study
what
the
connection
thyrza
has
got
her
very
face
it
just
come
to
me
i
sure
that
was
her
mother
how
impossible
that
you
should
have
that
woman
face
still
in
your
mind
gilbert
protested
dear
do
be
so
hasty
it
as
clear
to
me
as
if
lizzie
had
just
come
in
and
said
miss
denny
brought
me
home
why
there
the
name
it
fell
from
my
tongue
to
be
sure
miss
denny
a
pale
little
thing
she
was
often
and
often
i
been
at
the
window
and
seen
her
coming
along
the
street
hand
in
hand
with
your
sister
now
i
ask
thyrza
if
her
mother
name
was
denny
and
if
she
did
teach
at
green
school
depend
upon
it
i
right
gilbert
gilbert
still
smiled
very
incredulously
be
a
marvellous
thing
if
it
turns
out
to
be
true
he
said
but
i
have
a
wonderful
memory
for
faces
i
always
used
to
think
there
was
something
very
good
in
that
teacher
look
i
do
think
i
ever
spoke
to
her
though
she
went
backwards
and
forwards
past
our
house
in
brook
street
for
nearly
two
years
then
i
did
see
her
any
more
depend
upon
it
she
went
away
to
be
married
lizzie
had
left
a
little
before
that
oh
yes
it
explains
why
i
seemed
to
know
thyrza
the
first
time
i
saw
her
grail
was
profoundly
satisfied
again
a
short
silence
ensued
nicely
they
keep
themselves
she
resumed
half
to
herself
sure
lydia
one
of
the
most
careful
girls
i
ever
knew
but
thyrza
my
favourite
how
she
enjoyed
your
reading
gilbert
he
nodded
but
kept
his
attention
on
the
book
his
mother
just
glanced
at
him
and
presently
continued
do
hope
she
wo
be
spoilt
she
is
very
pretty
is
she
but
they
not
girls
for
going
out
much
i
can
see
and
thyrza
always
glad
when
i
ask
her
to
come
and
have
tea
with
us
i
suppose
they
have
many
friends
it
was
quite
against
grail
wont
to
interrupt
thus
when
her
son
had
settled
down
to
read
gilbert
averted
his
eyes
from
the
page
and
after
reflecting
a
little
said
knows
them
his
mother
looked
at
him
closely
he
seemed
to
be
absorbed
again
he
speak
to
you
about
them
gilbert
mentioned
them
once
or
twice
that
why
lydia
goes
out
to
chapel
the
old
lady
said
with
a
smile
i
do
think
so
the
reply
was
so
abrupt
so
nearly
impatient
that
grail
made
an
end
of
her
remarks
in
a
little
while
she
too
began
to
read
they
had
supper
at
nine
at
ten
grail
kissed
her
forehead
and
bade
him
adding
sit
long
my
dear
every
night
she
took
leave
of
him
with
the
same
words
and
they
were
not
needless
gilbert
too
often
forgot
the
progress
of
time
and
spent
in
study
the
hours
which
were
demanded
for
sleep
his
daily
employment
was
at
a
large
candle
and
soap
factory
by
such
work
he
had
earned
his
living
for
more
than
twenty
years
as
a
boy
he
had
begun
with
wages
of
four
shillings
a
week
his
task
being
to
trim
with
a
knife
the
rough
edges
of
tablets
of
soap
just
stamped
out
by
degrees
he
had
risen
to
a
weekly
income
of
forty
shillings
occasionally
increased
by
pay
for
overtime
beyond
this
he
was
not
likely
to
get
men
younger
than
he
had
passed
him
attaining
the
position
of
foreman
and
the
like
some
had
earned
money
by
inventions
which
they
put
at
the
service
of
their
employers
but
gilbert
could
hope
for
nothing
more
than
the
standing
of
a
trustworthy
mechanic
who
as
long
as
he
keeps
his
strength
can
count
on
daily
bread
his
heart
was
not
in
his
work
it
would
have
been
strange
if
he
had
thriven
by
an
industry
which
was
only
a
weariness
to
him
his
hours
were
from
six
in
the
morning
to
seven
at
night
ah
that
terrible
rising
at
five
when
it
seemed
at
first
as
if
he
must
fall
back
again
in
sheer
anguish
of
fatigue
when
his
eyeballs
throbbed
to
the
light
and
the
lids
were
as
if
weighted
with
iron
when
the
bitterness
of
the
day
before
him
was
like
poison
in
his
heart
he
could
not
live
as
his
did
coming
home
to
satisfy
his
hunger
and
spend
a
couple
of
hours
in
recreation
then
to
sleep
every
minute
of
freedom
of
time
in
which
he
was
no
longer
a
machine
but
a
thinking
and
desiring
man
he
held
precious
as
fine
gold
how
could
he
yield
to
heaviness
and
sleep
when
books
lay
open
before
him
and
knowledge
the
goddess
of
his
worship
whispered
wondrous
promises
to
gilbert
a
printed
page
was
as
the
fountain
of
life
he
loved
literature
passionately
and
hungered
to
know
the
history
of
man
mind
through
all
the
ages
this
distinguished
him
markedly
from
the
not
uncommon
working
man
who
zealously
pursues
some
chosen
branch
of
study
such
men
ordinarily
take
up
subjects
of
practical
bearing
physical
science
is
wont
to
be
their
field
or
if
they
study
history
it
is
from
the
point
of
view
of
current
politics
taste
for
literature
pure
and
simple
and
disinterested
love
of
historical
search
are
the
rarest
things
among
the
naturally
so
seeing
how
seldom
they
come
of
anything
but
academical
tillage
of
the
right
soil
the
average
man
of
education
is
fond
of
literature
because
the
environment
of
his
growth
has
made
such
fondness
a
second
nature
gilbert
had
conceived
his
passion
by
mere
grace
it
had
developed
in
him
slowly
at
twenty
years
he
was
a
young
fellow
of
seemingly
rather
sluggish
character
without
social
tendencies
without
the
common
ambitions
of
his
class
much
given
to
absence
of
mind
about
that
time
he
came
across
one
of
the
volumes
of
the
elder
and
behold
he
had
found
himself
reading
of
things
utterly
unknown
to
him
he
was
inspired
with
strange
delights
a
mysterious
fascination
drew
him
on
amid
names
which
were
only
a
sound
a
great
desire
was
born
in
him
and
its
object
was
seen
in
every
volume
that
met
his
eye
had
he
then
been
given
means
and
leisure
he
would
have
become
at
the
least
a
man
of
noteworthy
learning
no
such
good
fortune
awaited
him
daily
his
thirteen
hours
went
to
the
manufacture
of
candles
and
the
evening
leisure
with
one
free
day
in
the
week
was
all
he
could
ever
hope
for
at
he
had
a
grave
illness
insufficient
rest
and
ceaseless
trouble
of
spirit
brought
him
to
death
door
for
a
long
time
it
seemed
as
if
he
must
content
himself
with
earning
his
bread
he
had
no
right
to
call
upon
others
to
bear
the
burden
of
his
needs
his
brother
a
steady
mechanic
who
was
doing
well
in
the
midlands
and
had
just
married
spoke
to
him
with
uncompromising
common
sense
if
he
chose
to
incapacitate
himself
he
must
not
look
to
his
relatives
to
support
him
silently
gilbert
acquiesced
silently
he
went
back
to
the
factory
and
when
he
came
home
of
nights
sat
with
eyes
gazing
blankly
before
him
his
mother
lived
with
him
she
and
his
sister
the
latter
went
out
to
work
all
were
dependent
upon
the
wages
of
the
week
nearly
a
year
went
by
during
which
gilbert
did
not
open
a
book
it
was
easier
for
him
he
said
not
to
read
at
all
than
to
measure
his
reading
by
the
demands
of
his
bodily
weakness
he
would
have
sold
his
handful
of
books
sold
them
in
sheer
bitterness
of
mind
but
this
his
mother
interfered
to
prevent
but
he
could
not
live
so
there
was
now
a
danger
that
the
shadow
of
misery
would
darken
into
madness
little
by
little
he
resumed
his
studious
habits
yet
with
prudence
at
thirty
his
bodily
strength
seemed
to
have
consolidated
itself
if
he
now
and
then
exceeded
the
allotted
hours
at
night
he
did
not
feel
the
same
evil
results
as
formerly
his
sister
was
a
very
dear
companion
to
him
she
had
his
own
tastes
in
a
simpler
form
and
woman
tact
enabled
her
to
draw
him
into
the
repose
of
congenial
talk
when
she
and
her
mother
were
troubled
by
signs
of
overwork
in
him
he
purchased
a
book
as
often
as
he
could
reconcile
himself
to
the
outlay
and
his
knowledge
grew
though
he
seemed
to
himself
ever
on
the
mere
threshold
of
the
promised
land
hopeless
of
admission
then
came
his
sister
death
and
the
removal
from
battersea
back
to
lambeth
henceforth
it
would
be
seldomer
than
ever
that
he
could
devote
a
shilling
to
the
enrichment
of
his
shelves
when
both
he
and
lizzie
earned
wages
the
future
did
not
give
much
trouble
but
now
all
providence
was
demanded
his
brother
in
the
midlands
made
contribution
towards
the
mother
support
but
henry
had
a
family
of
his
own
and
it
was
only
right
that
gilbert
should
bear
the
greater
charge
gilbert
was
nearing
by
nature
he
was
a
lonely
man
amusement
such
as
his
world
offered
had
always
been
savourless
to
him
and
he
had
never
sought
familiar
fellowship
beyond
his
home
even
there
it
often
happened
that
for
days
he
kept
silence
he
would
eat
his
meal
when
he
came
from
work
then
take
his
book
to
a
corner
and
be
mute
answering
any
needful
question
with
a
gesture
or
the
briefest
word
at
such
times
his
face
had
the
lines
of
age
you
would
have
deemed
him
a
man
weighed
upon
by
some
vast
sorrow
and
was
he
not
his
life
was
speeding
by
already
the
best
years
were
gone
the
years
of
youth
and
force
and
hope
nay
hope
he
could
not
be
said
to
have
known
unless
it
were
for
a
short
space
when
first
the
purpose
of
his
being
dawned
upon
consciousness
and
the
end
of
that
had
been
bitter
enough
the
purpose
he
knew
was
frustrated
the
have
been
which
is
called
no
more
too
late
farewell
often
stared
him
in
the
eyes
with
those
unchanging
orbs
of
ghastliness
chilling
the
flow
of
his
blood
and
making
life
the
cruellest
of
mockeries
yet
he
was
not
driven
to
that
kind
of
resentment
which
makes
the
revolutionary
spirit
his
personality
was
essentially
that
of
a
student
conservative
instincts
were
stronger
in
him
than
the
misery
which
accused
his
fortune
a
touch
of
creative
genius
and
you
had
the
man
whose
song
would
lead
battle
against
the
hoary
iniquities
of
the
world
that
was
denied
him
he
could
only
eat
his
own
heart
in
despair
his
protest
against
the
outrage
of
fate
a
desolate
silence
a
lonely
man
yet
a
tender
one
the
capacity
of
love
was
not
less
in
him
than
the
capacity
of
knowledge
yet
herein
too
he
was
wronged
by
circumstance
in
youth
an
extreme
shyness
held
him
from
intercourse
with
all
women
save
his
mother
and
his
sister
he
was
conscious
of
his
lack
of
ease
in
dialogue
of
an
awkwardness
of
manner
and
an
unattractiveness
of
person
on
summer
evenings
when
other
young
fellows
were
ready
enough
in
finding
companions
for
their
walk
gilbert
would
stray
alone
in
the
quietest
streets
until
he
tired
himself
then
go
home
and
brood
over
fruitless
longings
in
love
as
afterwards
in
study
he
had
his
ideal
sometimes
he
would
catch
a
glimpse
of
some
face
in
the
street
at
night
and
would
walk
on
with
the
feeling
that
his
happiness
had
passed
him
if
only
he
could
have
turned
and
pursued
it
in
all
women
he
had
supreme
faith
that
one
woman
whom
his
heart
imagined
was
a
pure
and
noble
creature
with
measureless
aspiration
womanhood
glorified
in
her
to
the
type
of
the
upward
striving
soul
she
did
not
come
to
him
his
life
remained
chaste
and
lonely
neither
had
he
friends
there
were
at
all
times
good
fellows
to
be
found
among
those
with
whom
he
worked
but
again
his
shyness
held
him
apart
and
indeed
he
felt
that
intercourse
with
them
would
afford
him
but
brief
satisfaction
occasionally
some
man
more
thoughtful
than
the
rest
would
be
drawn
to
him
by
curiosity
but
finding
himself
met
with
so
much
reserve
involuntary
in
gilbert
would
become
doubtful
and
turn
elsewhither
for
sympathy
yet
in
this
respect
grail
improved
as
time
went
on
as
his
character
ripened
he
was
readier
to
gossip
now
and
then
of
common
things
with
average
associates
he
knew
however
that
he
was
not
much
liked
and
this
naturally
gave
a
certain
coldness
to
his
behaviour
perhaps
the
very
first
man
for
whom
he
found
himself
entertaining
something
like
warmth
of
kindness
was
luke
ackroyd
ackroyd
came
to
the
factory
shortly
after
gilbert
had
gone
to
live
in
walnut
tree
walk
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
the
two
had
got
into
the
habit
of
walking
their
common
way
homewards
together
as
might
have
been
anticipated
it
was
a
character
very
unlike
his
own
which
had
at
length
attached
gilbert
to
begin
with
ackroyd
was
pronounced
in
radicalism
was
aggressive
and
at
times
noisy
then
he
was
far
from
possessing
grail
moral
stability
and
did
not
care
to
conceal
his
ways
of
amusing
himself
lastly
his
intellectual
tastes
were
of
the
scientific
order
yet
gilbert
from
the
first
liked
him
he
felt
that
there
was
no
little
good
in
the
fellow
if
only
it
could
be
fostered
at
the
expense
of
his
weaker
characteristics
yet
those
very
weaknesses
had
much
to
do
with
his
amiability
this
they
had
in
common
both
aspired
to
something
that
fortune
had
denied
them
ackroyd
had
his
idea
of
a
social
revolution
and
though
it
seemed
doubtful
whether
he
was
exactly
the
man
to
claim
a
larger
sphere
for
the
energies
of
his
class
his
thought
often
had
genuine
nobleness
clearly
recognisable
by
gilbert
ackroyd
had
above
the
average
and
it
was
his
right
to
strive
for
a
better
lot
than
the
could
assure
him
so
grail
listened
with
a
smile
of
much
indulgence
to
the
young
fellow
fuming
against
the
order
of
things
and
if
he
now
and
then
put
in
a
critical
remark
was
not
sorry
to
have
it
scornfully
swept
aside
with
a
flood
of
vehement
words
he
felt
perchance
that
a
share
of
such
vigour
might
have
made
his
own
existence
more
fruitful
this
was
gilbert
grail
at
the
time
with
which
we
are
now
concerned
his
mother
believed
that
she
had
discovered
in
him
something
of
a
new
mood
of
late
a
tendency
to
quiet
cheerfulness
and
she
attributed
it
in
part
to
the
healthfulness
of
intercourse
with
a
friend
partly
she
assigned
to
it
another
reason
but
her
assumption
did
not
receive
much
proof
from
gilbert
demeanour
when
left
alone
in
the
this
sunday
night
since
thyrza
departure
he
had
in
truth
only
made
pretence
of
reading
and
now
that
his
mother
was
gone
he
let
the
book
fall
from
his
hands
his
countenance
was
fixed
in
a
supreme
sadness
his
lips
were
tightly
closed
and
at
times
moved
as
if
in
the
suppression
of
pain
hopelessness
in
youth
unless
it
be
justified
by
some
direst
ruin
of
the
future
is
wont
to
touch
us
either
with
impatience
or
with
a
comforting
sense
that
reaction
is
at
hand
in
a
man
of
middle
age
it
moves
us
with
pure
pathos
the
sight
of
gilbert
as
he
sat
thus
motionless
would
have
brought
tears
to
kindly
eyes
the
past
was
a
burden
on
his
memory
the
future
lay
before
him
like
a
long
road
over
which
he
must
wearily
toil
the
goal
frustration
he
could
not
forget
himself
in
the
thoughts
of
other
men
it
was
one
of
the
dread
hours
which
at
intervals
came
upon
him
when
the
veil
was
lifted
from
the
face
of
destiny
and
he
was
bidden
gaze
himself
into
despair
at
such
times
he
would
gladly
have
changed
beings
with
the
idlest
and
emptiest
of
his
their
life
might
be
ignoble
but
it
had
abundance
of
enjoyment
to
him
there
came
no
joy
nor
ever
would
only
when
he
lay
in
his
last
sleep
would
it
truly
be
said
of
him
that
he
rested
at
twelve
he
rose
he
had
no
longing
for
sleep
but
in
five
hours
the
new
week
would
have
begun
and
he
must
face
it
with
what
bodily
strength
he
might
before
entering
his
bedroom
which
was
next
to
the
parlour
he
went
to
the
and
opened
it
quietly
a
soft
rain
was
falling
leaving
the
door
ajar
he
stepped
out
into
the
street
and
looked
up
to
the
top
windows
there
was
no
light
behind
the
blinds
as
if
satisfied
he
went
hack
into
the
house
and
to
his
room
the
factory
was
at
so
short
a
distance
from
walnut
tree
walk
that
gilbert
was
able
to
come
home
for
breakfast
and
dinner
when
he
entered
at
on
monday
his
mother
pointed
to
a
letter
on
the
he
examined
the
address
and
was
at
a
loss
to
recognise
the
writing
this
from
i
wonder
he
said
as
he
opened
the
envelope
he
found
a
short
letter
and
a
printed
slip
which
looked
like
a
circular
the
former
ran
thus
i
am
about
to
deliver
a
course
of
evening
lectures
on
a
period
of
english
literature
in
a
room
which
i
have
taken
for
the
purpose
high
street
lambeth
i
desire
to
have
a
small
audience
not
more
than
twenty
consisting
of
working
men
who
belong
to
lambeth
attendance
will
be
at
my
invitation
of
course
without
any
kind
of
charge
you
have
been
mentioned
to
me
as
one
likely
to
be
interested
in
the
subject
i
propose
to
deal
with
i
permit
myself
to
send
you
a
printed
syllabus
of
the
course
and
to
say
that
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
if
you
are
able
to
attend
i
should
like
to
arrange
for
two
lectures
weekly
each
of
an
hour
duration
the
days
i
leave
undecided
also
the
hour
as
i
wish
to
adapt
these
to
the
convenience
of
my
hearers
if
you
feel
inclined
to
give
thought
to
the
matter
will
you
meet
me
at
the
at
eight
on
the
evening
of
sunday
august
when
we
could
discuss
details
the
lectures
themselves
had
better
i
should
think
begin
with
the
month
of
september
to
this
is
unnecessary
i
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
on
the
believe
me
to
be
yours
very
truly
egremont
this
is
what
ackroyd
was
speaking
of
on
saturday
gilbert
remarked
holding
the
letter
to
his
mother
wonder
what
it
means
is
this
mr
egremont
asked
grail
belongs
to
the
firm
of
egremont
pollard
so
ackroyd
tells
me
you
know
that
big
factory
in
westminster
bridge
road
where
they
make
gilbert
was
perusing
the
printed
syllabus
it
interested
him
and
he
kept
it
by
his
plate
when
he
sat
down
to
dinner
you
think
of
going
his
mother
inquired
i
should
like
to
if
the
lectures
are
good
i
suppose
he
a
young
fellow
fresh
from
college
he
may
have
something
to
say
and
he
may
be
only
conceited
there
no
knowing
still
i
do
dislike
the
way
he
writes
yes
i
think
i
shall
go
and
have
a
look
at
him
at
all
events
gilbert
finished
his
meal
and
walked
back
to
the
factory
groups
of
men
were
standing
about
in
the
sunshine
waiting
for
the
bell
to
ring
some
talked
and
joked
some
amused
themselves
with
the
narrow
street
was
redolent
with
oleaginous
matter
the
clothing
of
the
men
was
penetrated
with
the
same
nauseous
odour
at
a
little
distance
from
the
factory
ackroyd
was
sitting
on
a
smoking
a
pipe
grail
took
a
seat
beside
him
and
drew
from
his
pocket
the
letter
he
had
just
received
got
one
of
them
too
luke
observed
with
small
show
of
interest
there
was
an
unaccustomed
gloom
on
his
face
he
puffed
at
his
pipe
rather
sullenly
has
told
him
our
names
and
addresses
gilbert
asked
no
doubt
how
comes
bower
to
know
anything
about
me
i
mentioned
you
sometimes
do
you
think
of
going
i
sha
go
it
is
at
all
in
my
line
gilbert
became
silent
the
matter
he
asked
presently
as
his
companion
puffed
on
in
the
same
gloomy
way
bit
of
a
headache
that
all
his
tone
was
unusual
gilbert
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
pavement
easy
enough
to
see
what
it
means
ackroyd
continued
after
a
moment
referring
to
egremont
invitation
shall
be
having
an
election
before
long
and
he
going
to
stand
for
vauxhall
this
is
one
way
of
making
himself
known
i
thought
that
said
the
other
musingly
should
go
near
the
place
else
can
it
be
do
know
anything
about
the
man
but
he
may
have
an
idea
that
doing
good
so
quite
enough
to
prevent
me
from
going
what
the
devil
do
i
want
with
his
help
ca
i
read
about
english
literature
for
myself
i
ca
say
that
i
have
that
feeling
a
lecture
may
be
a
good
deal
of
use
if
the
man
knows
his
subject
well
but
he
added
smiling
suppose
you
object
to
him
and
his
position
course
i
do
what
business
has
the
fellow
to
have
so
much
time
that
he
does
know
what
to
do
with
it
might
use
it
worse
anyhow
do
know
about
that
i
rather
he
get
a
bad
name
then
it
be
easier
to
abuse
him
and
he
be
more
good
in
the
end
their
eyes
met
gilbert
had
a
humorous
expression
and
ackroyd
laughed
in
an
unmirthful
way
the
factory
bell
rang
gilbert
rose
and
waited
for
the
other
to
accompany
him
but
luke
after
a
struggle
to
his
feet
said
suddenly
be
hanged
i
had
enough
of
it
i
feel
mondayish
as
we
used
to
say
in
lancashire
you
coming
then
i
go
and
get
drunk
instead
on
old
man
no
good
in
getting
drunk
i
wo
but
i
ca
go
back
to
work
so
long
with
which
vernacular
he
turned
and
strolled
away
the
bell
was
clanging
its
last
strokes
gilbert
hurried
to
the
door
and
once
more
merged
his
humanity
in
the
machine
two
days
later
as
he
sat
over
his
evening
meal
gilbert
noticed
that
his
mother
had
something
to
say
she
cast
frequent
glances
at
him
her
pursed
lips
seemed
to
await
an
opportune
moment
mother
what
is
it
he
said
presently
with
his
wonted
look
of
kindness
by
living
so
long
together
and
in
such
close
intercourse
the
two
had
grown
skilled
in
the
reading
of
each
other
faces
dear
she
replied
with
something
of
solemnity
was
perfectly
right
miss
denny
those
girls
mother
there
no
doubt
about
it
i
asked
thyrza
she
knows
that
was
her
mother
name
and
she
knows
that
her
mother
was
a
teacher
that
case
i
nothing
more
to
say
you
a
wonderful
old
lady
as
i
often
told
you
have
a
good
memory
gilbert
you
ca
think
how
pleased
i
am
that
i
found
out
that
i
feel
more
interest
in
them
than
ever
and
the
child
seemed
so
pleased
too
she
could
scarcely
believe
that
i
known
her
mother
before
she
was
born
she
wants
me
to
tell
her
and
her
sister
all
i
can
remember
now
is
it
nice
gilbert
smiled
but
made
no
further
remark
the
evening
silence
set
in
chapter
vii
the
work
in
progress
on
the
sheltered
side
of
eastbourne
just
at
the
springing
of
the
downs
as
you
climb
towards
beachy
head
is
a
spacious
and
stone
house
with
pillared
porch
oriel
windows
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
front
and
a
square
turret
rising
above
the
fine
row
of
chestnuts
which
flanks
the
road
it
was
built
some
forty
years
ago
its
only
neighbours
then
being
a
few
rustic
cottages
recently
there
has
sprung
up
a
suburb
of
comely
houses
linking
it
with
the
visitors
quarter
of
eastbourne
the
builder
and
first
proprietor
a
gentleman
whose
dignity
derived
from
mark
lane
called
the
house
odessa
lodge
at
his
death
it
passed
by
purchase
into
the
hands
of
people
to
whom
this
name
seemed
something
worse
than
inappropriate
and
the
abode
was
henceforth
known
as
the
chestnuts
one
morning
early
in
november
three
months
after
the
date
of
that
letter
which
he
addressed
to
gilbert
grail
and
other
working
men
of
lambeth
our
friend
egremont
arrived
from
town
at
eastbourne
station
and
was
conveyed
thence
by
fly
to
the
house
of
which
i
speak
he
inquired
for
ormonde
that
lady
was
not
within
but
would
shortly
return
from
her
morning
drive
egremont
followed
the
servant
to
the
library
and
prepared
to
wait
the
room
was
handsomely
furnished
and
more
than
passably
supplied
with
books
which
inspection
showed
to
be
not
only
such
as
one
expects
to
find
in
the
library
of
a
country
house
but
to
a
great
extent
works
of
very
modern
issue
arguing
in
their
possessor
the
catholicity
of
taste
which
our
time
encourages
the
solid
books
which
form
the
substratum
of
every
collection
were
brought
together
by
brook
ormonde
in
the
first
instance
at
his
house
in
devonshire
square
when
failing
health
compelled
him
to
leave
london
the
town
establishment
was
broken
up
and
until
his
death
three
years
later
the
family
resided
wholly
at
the
chestnuts
during
those
years
the
library
grew
appreciably
for
the
son
of
the
house
horace
ormonde
had
just
come
forth
from
the
academic
curriculum
with
a
vast
appetite
for
literature
his
mother
moreover
was
of
the
women
who
read
whilst
ormonde
was
taking
a
lingering
farewell
of
the
world
and
its
concerns
these
two
active
minds
were
busy
with
the
thought
of
the
scientific
and
humanitarian
age
walter
egremont
was
then
a
frequent
visitor
of
the
house
he
and
horace
talked
many
a
summer
night
into
dawn
over
the
problems
which
nowadays
succeed
measles
and
scarlatina
as
a
form
of
youthful
complaint
but
horace
ormonde
had
even
a
shorter
span
of
life
before
him
than
his
invalid
father
he
was
drowned
in
bathing
and
it
was
egremont
who
had
to
take
the
news
up
to
the
chestnuts
a
few
months
later
there
was
another
funeral
from
the
house
ormonde
remained
alone
it
was
in
this
room
that
egremont
had
waited
for
the
mother
coming
that
morning
when
he
returned
companionless
from
the
beach
he
was
then
but
big
task
was
as
terrible
as
a
man
can
be
called
upon
to
perform
ormonde
had
the
strength
to
remember
that
she
shed
no
tears
uttered
no
lamentations
when
after
a
few
questions
she
was
going
silently
from
the
room
walter
his
own
eyes
blinded
caught
her
hand
and
pressed
it
passionately
in
both
his
own
she
was
the
woman
whom
he
reverenced
above
all
others
worshipping
her
with
that
pure
devotion
which
young
men
such
as
he
are
wont
to
feel
for
some
gracious
lady
much
their
elder
at
that
moment
he
would
have
given
his
own
life
to
the
sea
could
he
by
so
doing
have
brought
her
back
the
son
who
would
never
return
such
moments
do
not
come
often
to
the
best
of
us
perhaps
in
very
truth
do
not
repeat
themselves
egremont
never
entered
the
library
without
having
that
impulse
of
uttermost
unselfishness
brought
back
vividly
to
his
thoughts
on
that
account
he
liked
the
room
and
gladly
spent
a
quiet
in
it
in
a
little
less
than
that
ormonde
returned
from
her
breathing
of
the
sea
air
at
the
door
she
was
told
of
egremont
arrival
and
with
a
look
of
pleased
expectancy
she
went
at
once
to
the
library
egremont
rose
from
the
fireside
and
advanced
with
the
quiet
confidence
with
which
one
greets
only
the
dearest
friends
the
sunshine
has
brought
you
she
said
holding
his
hand
for
a
moment
had
a
terrible
storm
in
the
night
and
the
morning
is
very
sweet
after
it
had
you
arrived
a
very
little
sooner
you
would
have
been
in
time
to
drive
with
me
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
have
no
need
to
soften
their
voice
when
they
would
express
kindness
her
clear
and
firm
yet
sweet
tones
uttered
with
perfection
a
nature
very
richly
and
tenderly
endowed
during
the
past
five
years
she
had
aged
in
appearance
the
grief
which
she
would
not
expose
had
drawn
its
lines
upon
her
features
and
something
too
of
imperfect
health
was
visible
there
but
her
gaze
was
the
same
as
ever
large
benevolent
intellectual
in
her
presence
egremont
always
felt
a
a
peace
of
mind
which
gave
to
his
own
look
its
pleasantest
quality
of
friends
she
was
still
and
would
ever
be
the
dearest
to
him
the
thought
of
her
approval
was
always
active
with
him
when
he
made
plans
for
fruitful
work
he
could
not
have
come
before
her
with
a
consciousness
of
ignoble
fault
weighing
upon
his
mind
she
passed
upstairs
and
he
followed
more
slowly
behind
the
first
landing
was
a
small
conservatory
and
there
amid
evergreens
sat
two
children
whose
appearance
would
have
surprised
a
chance
visitor
knowing
nothing
of
the
house
and
its
mistress
they
obviously
came
from
some
very
poor
home
their
clothing
was
of
the
plainest
possible
and
save
that
they
were
very
clean
and
in
perfect
order
they
might
have
been
sitting
on
a
doorstep
in
a
london
back
street
ormonde
had
thrown
a
kind
word
to
them
in
hurrying
by
at
the
sight
of
egremont
they
hushed
their
renewed
talk
and
turned
shamefaced
looks
to
the
ground
he
went
on
to
the
where
there
was
the
same
comfort
and
elegance
as
in
the
library
almost
immediately
ormonde
joined
him
you
want
news
she
said
with
her
own
smile
always
a
little
sad
always
mingling
tenderness
with
reserve
on
the
firm
lips
i
told
you
everything
essential
in
my
letter
annabel
is
in
admirable
health
both
of
body
and
mind
she
is
deep
in
virgil
and
dante
what
more
could
you
wish
her
her
father
i
am
sorry
to
say
is
not
altogether
well
indeed
i
was
guilty
of
doing
my
best
to
get
him
to
london
for
the
winter
that
is
something
of
which
your
letter
made
no
mention
for
i
did
succeed
at
least
he
shook
his
head
very
persistently
heartily
wish
you
had
succeeded
could
you
get
help
from
annabel
miss
newthorpe
mind
let
it
be
annabel
between
us
said
ormonde
seating
herself
near
the
fire
tried
to
but
she
was
not
fervent
all
the
same
it
is
just
possible
i
think
that
they
may
come
newthorpe
needs
society
however
content
he
may
believe
himself
annabel
to
my
surprise
does
really
seem
independent
of
such
aids
how
wonderfully
she
has
grown
since
i
saw
her
two
years
ago
no
no
i
do
mean
physically
though
that
is
also
true
but
how
her
mind
has
grown
even
her
letters
had
quite
prepared
me
for
what
i
found
egremont
was
leaning
on
the
back
of
a
chair
his
hands
folded
together
he
kept
silence
and
ormonde
with
a
glance
at
him
added
she
is
something
less
than
human
at
present
probably
that
will
last
for
another
year
or
so
than
human
impersonal
with
the
exception
of
her
father
you
were
the
only
living
person
of
whom
she
voluntarily
spoke
to
me
spoke
of
me
naturally
your
accounts
of
lambeth
affair
interest
her
deeply
though
again
in
rather
too
what
shall
we
call
it
too
theoretical
a
way
but
that
comes
of
her
inexperience
she
at
least
speaks
of
me
ormonde
could
have
made
a
discouraging
rejoinder
she
said
nothing
for
a
moment
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
then
now
for
your
own
news
i
have
is
unsatisfactory
a
week
ago
the
class
suffered
a
secession
you
remember
my
description
of
ackroyd
the
young
man
of
critical
aspect
same
he
has
now
missed
two
lectures
and
i
do
think
he
come
again
you
spoken
to
bower
about
him
the
fact
is
my
impressions
of
bower
have
continued
to
grow
unfavourable
plainly
he
cares
next
to
nothing
for
the
lectures
there
is
a
curious
pomposity
about
him
too
which
grates
upon
me
i
should
have
been
at
all
sorry
if
he
had
been
the
seceder
he
bored
terribly
i
know
yet
he
naturally
feels
bound
to
keep
his
place
but
i
very
sorry
that
ackroyd
has
gone
he
has
brains
and
i
wanted
to
get
to
know
him
i
shall
not
give
him
up
i
must
persuade
him
to
come
and
have
a
talk
with
me
of
mr
grail
grail
is
faithful
yes
grail
is
the
man
of
them
all
that
i
am
sure
of
i
am
going
to
ask
him
to
stay
after
the
lecture
i
have
spoken
privately
with
him
yet
but
i
think
i
can
begin
now
to
establish
nearer
relations
with
two
or
three
of
them
i
have
been
lecturing
for
just
a
couple
of
months
they
ought
to
know
something
of
me
by
this
time
on
the
whole
i
think
i
am
succeeding
but
if
there
is
one
of
them
on
whom
i
found
great
hopes
it
is
grail
the
first
time
i
saw
him
i
knew
what
a
distinction
there
was
between
him
and
the
others
he
seems
to
be
a
friend
of
ackroyd
too
i
must
try
to
get
at
ackroyd
by
means
of
him
he
grail
i
mean
a
married
man
really
do
know
yet
i
should
think
so
i
should
be
surprised
if
he
were
unhappily
married
certainly
there
is
some
great
trouble
in
his
life
sometimes
he
looks
terribly
worn
quite
mr
bunce
she
asked
with
a
look
of
peculiar
interest
bunce
is
also
a
good
deal
of
a
mystery
to
me
he
too
always
looks
more
or
less
miserable
and
i
afraid
his
interest
is
not
very
absorbing
still
he
takes
notes
and
now
and
then
even
puts
an
intelligent
question
has
not
attacked
you
on
the
subject
of
religion
yet
no
we
still
have
that
question
to
fight
out
but
of
course
i
must
know
him
very
well
before
i
approach
it
i
think
he
bears
me
goodwill
i
caught
him
looking
at
me
with
a
curious
sort
of
cordiality
the
other
night
must
have
that
little
girl
of
his
down
again
ormonde
said
wonder
whether
she
still
reads
that
insufferable
publication
i
found
you
had
told
them
the
story
at
ullswater
it
came
up
of
my
scheme
a
gong
sounded
down
below
remarked
ormonde
birds
are
going
to
their
dinner
poor
little
town
sparrows
we
let
them
get
settled
then
go
and
have
a
peep
at
them
shall
we
i
should
like
to
see
them
and
he
added
pleasantly
see
the
look
on
your
face
when
you
watch
them
have
much
to
thank
them
for
walter
she
said
earnestly
brighten
many
an
hour
when
i
should
be
unhappy
presently
ormonde
led
the
way
downstairs
and
to
the
rear
of
the
house
a
room
formerly
devoted
to
billiards
had
been
converted
into
a
homely
but
very
bright
refectory
it
was
hung
round
with
cheerful
pictures
and
before
each
of
the
two
windows
stood
a
large
aquarium
full
of
and
fishes
at
the
table
were
seated
seven
little
girls
of
ages
from
eight
to
thirteen
all
poorly
clad
yet
all
looking
remarkably
joyous
and
eating
with
much
evidence
of
appetite
at
the
head
of
the
table
was
a
woman
of
middle
age
and
motherly
aspect
mapper
she
had
the
superintendence
of
the
convalescents
whom
the
lady
of
the
house
received
and
sent
back
to
their
homes
in
london
better
physically
and
morally
than
they
had
ever
been
in
their
lives
before
the
children
did
not
notice
that
ormonde
and
her
companion
had
entered
they
were
chatting
gaily
over
their
meal
now
and
then
one
of
them
drew
a
gentle
word
of
correction
from
mapper
but
on
the
whole
they
needed
no
rebuke
those
who
had
been
longest
in
the
house
speedily
instructed
new
arrivals
in
the
behaviour
they
had
learned
to
deem
becoming
a
girl
waited
at
table
on
that
subject
ormonde
had
amusing
stories
to
relate
how
more
than
one
servant
had
regretfully
but
firmly
declined
to
wait
upon
little
ragamuffins
female
too
and
how
one
in
particular
had
explained
that
she
made
no
objection
to
doing
it
only
because
she
regarded
it
as
a
religious
penance
egremont
had
his
pleasure
in
regarding
her
face
nobly
beautiful
as
she
moved
her
eyes
from
one
to
another
of
her
poor
little
pensioners
she
had
said
at
first
that
it
would
be
impossible
ever
again
to
live
in
this
house
when
she
quitted
it
for
a
time
after
her
husband
death
how
could
she
pass
through
the
barren
rooms
how
dwell
within
sight
and
sound
of
the
treacherous
waves
which
had
taken
her
dearest
it
was
a
royal
thought
which
converted
the
sad
dwelling
into
a
home
for
those
whose
reawakening
laughter
would
chide
despondency
from
beneath
the
roof
whose
happiness
would
ease
the
heavy
heart
and
make
memory
a
sacred
solace
she
had
her
abounding
reward
and
such
as
only
the
greatly
loving
may
attain
to
they
withdrew
without
having
excited
attention
mapper
saw
them
but
ormonde
made
sign
to
her
to
say
nothing
are
upstairs
i
sorry
to
say
she
remarked
as
they
went
back
to
the
have
obstinate
colds
i
keep
them
under
the
the
difficulty
these
poor
things
have
in
getting
rid
of
a
cold
with
many
of
them
i
believe
such
a
condition
is
chronic
it
goes
on
i
suppose
until
they
die
of
it
they
talked
together
till
luncheon
time
egremont
led
the
conversation
back
to
ullswater
where
ormonde
had
just
spent
a
fortnight
think
i
must
go
and
see
them
at
christmas
he
said
they
come
south
the
other
considered
go
so
soon
she
said
at
length
soon
it
will
be
six
mortal
months
advised
egremont
sighed
and
left
the
subject
me
what
you
have
been
doing
of
late
ormonde
resumed
from
your
lectures
little
of
which
any
account
can
be
rendered
i
read
a
good
deal
and
occasionally
come
across
an
acquaintance
you
seen
the
tyrrells
since
they
returned
i
had
an
invitation
to
dine
with
them
the
other
day
but
excused
myself
what
grounds
mean
to
see
less
of
people
in
general
ormonde
regarded
him
hope
she
said
you
will
pursue
no
such
idea
you
mean
of
course
that
your
lambeth
work
is
to
be
absorbing
let
it
be
so
but
do
fall
into
the
mistake
of
making
it
your
burden
you
are
not
one
of
those
who
can
work
in
solitude
am
getting
a
distaste
for
ordinary
society
i
beg
of
you
to
resist
the
mood
go
into
society
freely
you
are
in
danger
as
soon
as
you
begin
to
neglect
it
individually
she
smiled
at
the
deprecating
look
he
turned
on
her
me
be
your
moral
physician
already
i
notice
that
you
fall
short
of
perfect
health
the
refusal
of
that
invitation
is
a
symptom
pray
give
faith
to
what
i
say
if
any
one
knows
you
i
think
it
is
i
he
kept
silence
ormonde
continued
hear
that
the
tyrrells
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
dalmaine
paula
mentions
him
in
a
letter
with
enthusiasm
probably
they
met
him
somewhere
in
switzerland
he
gave
them
the
benefit
of
his
experience
on
the
education
question
course
well
i
am
prejudiced
against
the
man
as
you
know
is
a
force
it
looks
as
if
we
should
hear
a
good
deal
of
him
in
the
future
the
incarnate
ideal
of
british
philistinism
is
sure
to
have
a
career
before
him
the
lady
laughed
early
in
the
afternoon
egremont
took
leave
of
his
friend
and
returned
to
london
it
was
his
habit
when
in
england
to
run
down
to
eastbourne
in
this
way
about
once
a
month
since
the
death
of
his
father
his
home
had
been
represented
by
rooms
in
great
russell
street
he
chose
them
on
account
of
their
proximity
to
the
british
museum
at
that
time
he
believed
himself
destined
to
produce
some
monumental
work
of
erudition
the
subject
had
not
defined
itself
but
his
thoughts
were
then
busy
with
the
origins
of
christianity
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
study
of
certain
oriental
literatures
would
be
fruitful
of
results
characteristically
he
must
establish
himself
at
the
very
doors
of
the
great
library
his
oriental
researches
as
we
know
were
speedily
abandoned
but
the
rooms
in
great
russell
street
still
kept
their
tenant
they
were
far
from
an
ideal
abode
indifferently
furnished
with
draughty
doors
and
smoky
chimneys
and
the
rent
was
exorbitant
the
landlady
who
speedily
gauged
her
lodger
character
had
already
made
a
small
competency
out
of
him
even
during
long
absences
abroad
egremont
retained
the
domicile
at
each
return
he
said
to
himself
that
he
must
really
find
quarters
at
once
more
reputable
and
more
homelike
but
the
thought
of
removing
his
books
of
dealing
with
new
people
deterred
him
from
the
actual
step
in
fact
was
indifferent
as
to
where
or
how
he
lived
all
he
asked
was
the
possibility
of
privacy
the
ugliness
of
his
surroundings
did
not
trouble
him
for
he
paid
no
attention
to
them
some
day
he
would
have
a
beautiful
home
but
what
use
in
thinking
of
that
till
he
had
someone
to
share
it
with
him
this
was
a
mere
a
it
housed
his
body
and
left
his
mind
free
the
real
home
which
he
remembered
was
a
house
looking
upon
clapham
common
his
father
dwelt
there
for
the
last
fifteen
years
of
his
life
his
mother
died
there
shortly
after
the
removal
from
the
small
house
in
newington
where
she
went
to
live
upon
her
marriage
with
much
tenderness
egremont
thought
of
the
and
man
whose
toil
had
made
such
provision
for
the
son
he
loved
uneducated
homely
narrow
enough
in
much
of
his
thinking
the
manufacturer
of
must
have
had
singular
possibilities
in
his
nature
to
renew
himself
in
a
youth
so
apt
for
modern
culture
as
walter
was
thinking
back
in
his
maturity
the
latter
remembered
many
a
noteworthy
trait
in
his
father
and
wished
the
old
man
could
have
lived
yet
a
few
more
years
to
see
his
son
work
really
beginning
and
egremont
often
felt
lonely
possibly
he
had
relatives
living
but
he
knew
of
none
in
any
case
they
could
not
now
be
of
real
account
to
him
the
country
of
his
birth
was
far
behind
him
how
far
he
had
recognised
since
he
began
his
lecturing
in
lambeth
none
the
less
he
at
times
knew
not
seldom
there
seemed
to
be
a
gap
between
him
and
the
people
born
to
refinement
who
were
his
associates
his
friends
that
phase
of
feeling
was
rather
strong
in
him
just
now
disguising
itself
in
the
form
of
sundry
plausible
motives
it
had
induced
him
to
decline
tyrrell
invitation
and
was
fostering
his
temporary
distaste
for
the
society
in
which
he
had
always
found
much
pleasure
what
if
in
strictness
he
belonged
to
neither
sphere
what
if
his
life
were
to
be
a
struggle
between
inherited
sympathies
and
the
affinities
of
his
intellect
all
the
better
perchance
for
his
prospect
of
usefulness
he
stood
as
a
mediator
between
two
sections
of
society
but
for
his
private
happiness
how
he
spent
this
evening
very
idly
sometimes
pacing
his
large
uncomfortable
room
sometimes
endeavouring
to
read
one
or
other
of
certain
volumes
new
from
the
circulating
library
of
late
he
had
passed
many
such
evenings
for
it
was
very
seldom
that
any
one
came
to
see
him
and
for
the
amusements
of
the
town
he
had
no
inclination
he
was
thinking
much
of
annabel
he
could
not
imagine
her
other
than
calm
intellectual
he
could
not
hear
her
voice
uttering
passionate
words
a
great
change
must
come
over
her
before
her
reserved
maidenliness
could
soften
to
such
sweet
humility
and
he
had
no
faith
in
his
power
so
to
change
her
the
next
day
was
thursday
this
and
sunday
were
his
lecture
days
his
class
met
at
eight
precisely
at
that
hour
he
reached
a
small
doorway
in
high
street
lambeth
and
ascended
a
flight
of
stairs
to
a
room
which
he
had
furnished
as
he
deemed
most
suitable
several
rows
of
faced
a
high
desk
at
which
he
stood
to
lecture
the
walls
were
washed
in
distemper
the
boarding
of
the
floor
was
uncovered
the
two
windows
were
hidden
with
plain
shutters
the
room
had
formerly
been
used
for
purposes
of
storage
by
a
glass
and
china
merchant
below
was
the
workshop
of
a
saddler
which
explained
the
pervading
odour
of
leather
a
little
group
of
men
stood
in
conversation
near
the
fire
on
egremont
appearance
they
seated
themselves
at
the
desks
each
producing
a
which
he
laid
open
before
him
thus
ranged
they
were
seen
to
be
eight
in
number
out
of
fourteen
to
whom
invitations
were
addressed
nine
had
presented
themselves
at
the
preliminary
meeting
one
we
know
had
since
proved
unfaithful
egremont
looked
round
for
ackroyd
on
entering
but
the
young
man
was
not
here
on
the
front
bench
were
two
men
whom
as
yet
you
know
only
by
name
bower
was
clearly
distinguishable
by
his
personal
importance
and
the
not
to
be
disguised
with
which
he
listened
to
the
opening
sentences
of
the
lecture
he
leaned
against
the
desk
behind
him
and
carefully
sharpened
the
point
of
his
pencil
he
was
a
large
man
with
a
beard
his
forehead
was
narrow
and
owed
its
appearance
of
height
to
incipient
baldness
his
eyes
were
small
and
shrewd
he
habitually
donned
his
suit
of
black
for
these
meetings
at
the
works
where
he
held
a
foreman
position
he
was
in
good
repute
for
years
he
had
proved
himself
skilful
steady
abundantly
respectful
to
his
employers
in
private
life
he
enjoyed
the
fame
of
a
petty
capitalist
since
his
marriage
thirty
years
ago
he
and
his
wife
had
made
it
the
end
of
their
existence
to
put
by
money
with
the
result
that
his
obsequiousness
when
at
work
was
balanced
by
the
blustering
independence
of
his
leisure
hours
the
man
was
a
fair
instance
of
the
way
in
which
prosperity
affects
the
average
proletarian
all
his
better
qualities
honesty
perseverance
sobriety
took
an
ignoble
colour
from
the
essential
vulgarity
of
his
nature
which
would
never
have
so
offensively
declared
itself
if
ill
fortune
had
kept
him
anxious
about
his
daily
bread
formerly
egremont
had
been
impressed
by
his
intelligent
manner
closer
observation
had
proved
to
him
of
how
little
worth
this
intelligence
was
in
its
subordination
to
a
paltry
character
bower
regarded
himself
as
the
originator
of
this
course
of
lectures
through
all
his
obsequiousness
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
deemed
his
indispensable
to
the
success
of
the
project
at
first
as
was
natural
egremont
had
sometimes
seemed
to
address
words
specially
to
him
of
late
he
had
purposely
avoided
doing
so
and
bower
began
to
feel
that
his
services
lacked
recognition
the
other
of
whom
there
has
been
casual
mention
was
joseph
bunce
of
spare
frame
and
with
hollow
cheeks
which
suggested
insufficiency
of
diet
he
yet
had
far
more
of
manliness
in
his
appearance
than
the
portly
bower
you
divined
in
him
independence
enough
and
of
worthier
origin
than
that
which
secretly
inflated
his
neighbour
his
features
were
at
first
sight
by
no
means
pleasing
their
coarseness
was
undeniable
but
familiarity
revealed
a
sensitive
significance
in
the
irregular
nose
the
prominent
lips
the
small
chin
and
long
throat
egremont
had
now
and
then
caught
a
light
in
his
eyes
which
was
warranty
for
more
than
his
rough
tongue
could
shape
into
words
he
often
appeared
to
have
a
difficulty
in
following
the
lecture
would
shrug
nervously
and
knit
his
brows
and
mutter
whenever
he
noticed
that
egremont
would
pause
a
little
and
repeat
in
simpler
form
what
he
had
been
saying
with
the
satisfactory
result
that
bunce
showed
a
clearer
face
and
jotted
something
on
his
dirty
with
his
stumpy
pencil
gilbert
grail
we
know
it
was
impossible
not
to
remark
him
as
the
one
who
followed
with
most
consecutive
understanding
even
if
his
countenance
had
not
declared
him
of
higher
grade
than
any
of
those
among
whom
he
sat
it
had
needed
only
the
first
ten
minutes
of
the
first
lecture
to
put
him
at
his
ease
with
regard
to
egremont
claims
to
stand
forward
as
a
teacher
the
preliminary
meeting
indeed
had
removed
the
suspicions
suggested
by
ackroyd
to
him
these
evenings
were
pure
enjoyment
he
delighted
in
this
subject
and
had
an
inexpressible
pleasure
in
listening
continuously
to
the
speech
of
a
cultivated
man
had
the
of
the
class
been
examined
egremont
had
strongly
advised
their
use
gilbert
jottings
would
probably
have
alone
been
found
of
substantial
value
seeing
that
he
alone
possessed
the
mental
habit
necessary
for
the
practice
bunce
would
doubtless
have
come
next
though
at
a
long
distance
a
carlylean
editor
might
have
disengaged
from
them
many
a
rudely
forcible
scrap
of
comment
pages
would
have
smelt
of
the
it
was
to
grail
that
egremont
mentally
directed
the
best
things
he
had
to
say
not
seldom
he
was
repaid
by
the
quick
gleam
of
sympathy
on
that
grave
interesting
face
the
remaining
five
hearers
were
average
artisans
of
the
inquiring
type
they
followed
with
perseverance
though
at
times
one
or
the
other
would
furtively
regard
his
watch
or
allow
his
eyes
to
stray
about
the
room
they
had
made
a
bargain
and
were
bent
on
honourably
carrying
out
their
share
in
it
but
egremont
already
began
to
doubt
whether
he
was
really
fixing
anything
in
their
thoughts
how
were
they
likely
to
serve
him
for
the
greater
purpose
whereto
this
instruction
was
only
preliminary
when
he
looked
forward
to
that
he
had
to
fix
his
eyes
on
grail
and
forget
the
others
he
was
beginning
to
regret
that
the
choice
of
those
to
whom
his
invitations
were
sent
had
depended
upon
bower
another
man
might
have
aided
him
more
effectually
yet
the
fact
was
that
selection
had
been
a
remarkably
good
one
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
assemble
nine
lambeth
workmen
of
higher
aggregate
intellect
than
those
who
responded
to
the
summons
it
would
have
been
on
the
other
hand
the
easiest
thing
to
find
nine
with
not
a
man
of
them
available
for
anything
more
than
futile
wrangling
over
politics
or
religion
egremont
would
know
this
some
day
he
was
yet
young
in
social
reform
and
the
lectures
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
they
were
good
egremont
had
capacity
for
teaching
with
his
education
had
he
been
without
resources
he
would
probably
have
chosen
an
academic
career
and
have
done
service
in
it
there
was
nothing
deep
in
his
style
of
narrative
and
criticism
and
here
depth
was
not
wanted
sufficient
that
he
was
perspicuous
and
energetic
he
loved
the
things
of
which
he
spoke
and
he
had
the
power
of
presenting
to
others
his
reason
for
loving
them
not
one
in
five
hundred
men
inexperienced
in
such
work
could
have
held
the
ears
of
the
class
as
he
did
for
the
first
two
or
three
evenings
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
mistake
his
spirit
ardent
disinterested
aspiring
impossible
not
to
feel
something
of
a
respondent
impulse
that
familiarity
should
diminish
the
effect
of
his
speech
was
only
to
be
anticipated
he
was
preaching
a
religion
but
one
that
could
find
no
acceptance
as
such
with
eight
out
of
nine
who
heard
him
common
minds
are
not
kept
at
mark
for
long
together
by
exhibition
of
the
merely
beautiful
however
persuasively
it
be
set
forth
he
had
chosen
the
elizabethan
period
and
he
led
up
to
it
by
the
kind
of
introduction
which
he
felt
would
be
necessary
trusting
himself
more
after
the
first
fortnight
he
ceased
to
write
out
his
lectures
verbatim
free
utterance
was
an
advantage
to
himself
and
his
audience
he
read
at
large
from
his
authors
to
expect
the
men
to
do
this
for
themselves
even
had
the
books
been
within
their
reach
would
have
been
too
much
and
without
such
illustration
the
lectures
were
vain
this
reading
brought
him
face
to
face
with
his
main
difficulty
how
to
create
in
men
a
sense
which
they
do
not
possess
the
working
man
does
not
read
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
fiction
has
little
interest
for
him
and
of
poetry
he
has
no
comprehension
whatever
your
artisan
of
brains
can
study
but
he
can
not
read
egremont
was
under
no
illusion
on
this
point
he
knew
well
that
the
loveliest
lyric
would
appeal
to
a
man
like
bower
no
more
than
an
unintelligible
demonstration
of
science
was
it
impossible
to
bestow
this
sense
of
intellectual
beauty
with
what
earnestness
he
made
the
endeavour
he
took
sweet
passages
of
prose
and
verse
and
read
them
with
all
the
feeling
and
skill
he
could
command
you
yield
to
that
he
said
within
himself
as
he
looked
from
face
to
face
your
ears
hopelessly
sealed
your
minds
immutably
earthen
grail
oh
yes
grail
had
the
right
intelligence
in
his
eyes
but
ackroyd
but
bunce
ackroyd
thought
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
no
more
poor
bunce
had
darkling
throes
of
mind
but
struggled
with
desperate
nervousness
and
could
not
be
at
ease
till
the
straightforward
talk
began
again
and
bower
nay
there
goes
more
to
this
matter
than
mere
enthusiasm
in
a
teacher
who
had
instructed
gilbert
grail
to
discern
the
grace
of
the
written
word
on
the
other
hand
it
was
doubtful
whether
walter
egremont
left
to
himself
in
the
home
of
his
good
plain
father
would
have
felt
what
now
he
did
the
soil
was
there
but
how
much
do
we
not
owe
to
tillage
read
what
egremont
on
one
occasion
read
to
these
men
he
beginneth
not
with
obscure
definitions
which
must
blur
the
margins
with
interpretations
and
load
the
memory
with
doubtfulness
but
he
cometh
to
you
with
words
set
in
delightful
proportion
either
accompanied
with
or
prepared
for
the
skill
of
music
and
with
a
tale
forsooth
he
cometh
unto
you
with
a
tale
which
holdeth
children
from
play
and
old
men
from
the
what
were
to
you
save
for
the
glow
of
memory
fed
with
incense
of
the
poets
save
for
innumerable
dear
associations
only
possible
to
the
instructed
which
make
the
finer
part
of
your
intellectual
being
walter
was
attempting
too
much
and
soon
became
painfully
conscious
of
it
he
came
to
the
dramatists
and
human
interest
thenceforth
helped
him
he
could
read
well
and
a
scene
from
those
giants
of
the
prime
had
efficiency
even
with
bower
hope
revived
in
the
lecturer
he
was
less
happy
than
usual
for
what
reason
he
could
not
himself
understand
his
thoughts
wandered
sometimes
to
eastbourne
sometimes
to
ullswater
yet
he
was
speaking
of
shakespeare
bower
was
more
than
usual
the
five
doubtful
hearers
obviously
felt
the
time
long
only
grail
gave
an
unfailing
ear
egremont
closed
with
a
sense
of
depression
would
bower
come
and
pester
him
with
fatuous
questions
and
remarks
no
bower
turned
away
and
reached
his
hat
from
the
peg
the
doubtful
five
took
down
their
hats
and
followed
the
portly
man
from
the
room
bunce
was
talking
with
grail
pointing
with
dirty
forefinger
to
something
in
his
dirty
but
he
too
speedily
moved
to
the
grail
was
also
going
when
egremont
said
you
spare
me
five
minutes
grail
i
should
like
to
speak
to
you
chapter
viii
a
clasp
of
hands
grail
approached
the
desk
with
pleasure
egremont
observed
it
and
met
his
trusty
auditor
with
the
which
made
his
face
so
agreeable
am
sorry
to
see
that
ackroyd
no
longer
sits
by
you
he
began
he
deserted
us
gilbert
hesitated
but
spoke
at
length
with
his
natural
directness
afraid
so
sir
has
lost
his
interest
in
the
subject
not
exactly
the
bent
of
his
mind
he
only
came
at
my
persuasion
to
begin
with
he
takes
more
to
science
than
literature
i
should
have
thought
that
but
i
wish
he
could
have
still
spared
me
the
two
hours
a
week
i
felt
much
interest
in
him
it
a
disappointment
to
lose
him
so
unexpectedly
i
sure
he
has
a
head
for
our
matters
as
well
as
for
science
grail
was
about
to
speak
but
checked
himself
an
inquiring
glance
persuaded
him
to
say
much
taken
up
with
politics
just
now
they
do
leave
the
mind
very
quiet
i
regret
more
than
ever
that
he
gone
egremont
moved
away
from
the
desk
at
which
he
had
been
standing
and
seated
himself
on
the
end
of
a
bench
which
came
out
opposite
the
and
sit
down
for
a
minute
will
you
mr
grail
he
said
gilbert
silently
took
possession
of
the
end
of
the
next
bench
there
no
persuading
him
back
do
you
think
he
would
come
and
have
a
talk
with
me
i
do
wish
he
would
i
believe
we
could
understand
each
other
you
see
him
occasionally
day
we
work
together
you
ask
him
to
come
and
have
a
chat
with
me
here
some
evening
shall
be
glad
to
sir
persuade
him
to
any
evening
he
likes
perhaps
next
sunday
after
the
lecture
would
do
tell
him
to
bring
his
pipe
and
have
a
smoke
with
me
here
before
the
fire
grail
smiled
and
undertook
to
deliver
the
invitation
there
are
other
things
i
wished
to
speak
of
to
you
egremont
continued
you
think
it
would
be
any
advantage
if
i
brought
books
for
the
members
of
the
class
to
take
away
and
use
at
their
leisure
shakespeare
of
course
you
can
all
lay
hands
on
but
the
other
elizabethan
authors
are
not
so
readily
found
for
instance
there
a
marlowe
on
the
desk
would
you
care
to
take
him
away
with
you
you
very
much
sir
was
the
reply
i
got
marlowe
i
picked
up
a
copy
a
year
or
two
ago
have
him
ah
that
good
egremont
was
surprised
but
remembered
that
it
would
not
be
very
courteous
to
express
such
feeling
after
surprise
came
new
warmth
of
interest
in
the
man
he
began
to
speak
of
marlowe
with
delight
and
in
a
moment
he
and
grail
were
on
a
footing
of
intimacy
there
are
other
books
perhaps
you
have
come
across
yet
i
shall
be
overjoyed
if
you
let
me
be
of
use
to
you
in
that
way
have
you
access
to
any
library
i
have
i
often
felt
the
want
of
it
egremont
fell
into
musing
for
a
moment
he
looked
up
with
an
idea
in
his
eyes
it
be
an
excellent
thing
if
one
could
establish
a
lending
library
in
lambeth
grail
might
have
excusably
replied
that
it
would
be
a
yet
more
excellent
thing
if
those
disposed
to
use
such
an
institution
had
time
granted
them
to
do
so
but
with
the
young
man
keen
look
fixed
upon
him
he
had
other
thoughts
would
be
a
great
thing
he
replied
with
subdued
feeling
he
seldom
allowed
his
stronger
emotions
to
find
high
utterance
that
moderated
voice
was
symbol
of
the
suppression
to
which
his
life
had
trained
itself
free
library
egremont
went
on
a
good
it
was
an
extension
of
his
scheme
and
delighted
him
with
its
prospect
of
possibilities
it
would
be
preparing
the
ground
upon
which
he
and
his
adherents
might
subsequently
work
could
be
undertake
to
found
a
library
at
his
own
expense
it
was
not
beyond
his
means
at
all
events
a
beginning
on
a
moderate
scale
his
eyes
sparkled
as
they
always
did
when
a
thought
burst
within
him
grail
i
have
a
mind
to
try
if
i
ca
work
on
that
idea
gilbert
was
stirred
this
interchange
of
words
had
strengthened
his
personal
liking
for
egremont
and
his
own
idealism
took
fire
from
that
of
the
other
he
regarded
the
young
man
with
admiration
and
with
noble
envy
to
be
able
to
devise
such
things
and
straightway
say
shall
be
done
how
blest
beyond
all
utterance
was
the
man
to
whom
fortune
had
given
such
power
he
reverenced
egremont
profoundly
it
was
the
nature
to
worship
to
bend
with
singleness
of
heart
before
whatsoever
seemed
to
him
high
and
beautiful
the
latter
continued
will
think
it
out
we
might
begin
with
a
moderate
supply
of
books
we
might
find
some
building
that
would
do
at
first
a
real
library
could
be
built
when
the
people
had
begun
to
appreciate
what
was
offered
them
better
no
doubt
if
they
would
tax
themselves
for
the
purpose
but
they
have
burdens
enough
wo
give
a
farthing
towards
a
library
said
grail
they
know
its
value
and
that
they
ca
do
until
they
have
learnt
it
from
books
we
break
the
circle
he
pondered
again
then
added
cheerfully
say
i
mean
you
and
the
others
who
come
to
my
lecture
i
want
if
possible
to
make
this
class
permanent
to
make
it
the
beginning
of
a
society
for
purposes
i
have
in
my
mind
i
must
tell
you
something
of
this
for
i
know
you
will
feel
with
me
mr
grail
the
reply
was
a
look
of
quiet
trust
egremont
had
not
thought
to
get
so
far
as
this
but
grail
personality
wrought
upon
him
even
as
his
on
grail
he
felt
a
desire
to
open
his
mind
as
he
had
done
that
evening
in
the
garden
by
ullswater
this
man
was
of
those
whom
he
would
benefit
but
if
he
mistook
not
far
unlike
the
crowd
grail
could
understand
as
few
of
his
class
could
be
expected
to
form
a
society
a
club
let
us
say
not
at
all
like
the
ordinary
clubs
there
are
plenty
of
places
where
men
can
meet
to
talk
about
what
ought
to
be
done
for
the
working
class
my
idea
is
to
bring
the
working
class
to
talk
of
what
it
can
do
for
itself
and
not
how
it
can
claim
its
material
rights
how
to
get
better
wages
shorter
hours
more
decent
homes
with
all
those
demands
i
sympathise
as
thoroughly
as
any
man
but
those
things
are
coming
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
time
to
ask
what
working
men
are
going
to
do
with
such
advantages
when
got
them
now
my
hope
is
to
get
a
few
men
to
see
what
you
i
know
see
clearly
enough
that
life
to
be
worthy
of
the
name
must
be
first
and
foremost
concerned
with
the
things
of
the
heart
and
mind
yet
everything
in
our
time
favours
the
opposite
the
struggle
for
existence
is
so
hard
that
we
grow
more
and
more
material
the
tendency
is
to
regard
it
as
the
end
of
life
to
make
money
if
there
time
to
think
of
higher
things
well
and
good
if
not
it
does
matter
much
well
we
have
to
earn
money
it
is
a
necessary
evil
but
let
us
think
as
little
about
it
as
we
may
our
social
state
in
short
has
converted
the
means
of
life
into
its
end
he
paused
and
gilbert
looked
hearty
agreement
puts
into
a
sentence
he
said
i
have
thought
through
many
an
hour
of
work
now
we
know
there
no
lack
of
schemes
for
reforming
society
most
of
them
seek
to
change
its
spirit
by
change
of
institutions
but
surely
it
is
plain
enough
that
reform
of
institutions
can
only
come
as
the
natural
result
of
a
change
in
men
minds
those
who
preach
revolution
to
the
disinherited
masses
give
no
thought
to
this
it
a
hard
and
a
bad
thing
to
live
under
an
oppressive
system
do
think
that
i
speak
lightly
of
the
miseries
which
must
drive
many
a
man
to
frenzy
till
he
heeds
nothing
so
long
as
the
present
curse
is
attacked
i
know
perfectly
well
that
for
thousands
of
the
poorest
there
is
no
possibility
of
a
life
guided
by
thought
and
feeling
of
a
higher
kind
until
they
are
lifted
out
of
the
mire
but
if
one
faces
the
question
with
a
grave
purpose
of
doing
good
that
will
endure
practical
considerations
must
outweigh
one
anger
there
is
no
way
of
lifting
those
poor
people
out
of
the
mire
if
their
children
children
tread
on
firm
ground
it
will
be
the
most
we
can
hope
for
but
there
is
a
class
of
working
people
that
can
and
should
aim
at
a
state
of
mind
far
above
that
which
now
contents
them
it
is
my
view
that
our
only
hope
of
social
progress
lies
in
the
possibility
of
this
class
being
stirred
to
effort
the
tendency
of
their
present
education
a
misapplication
of
the
word
must
be
counteracted
they
must
be
taught
to
value
supremely
quite
other
attainments
than
those
which
help
them
to
earn
higher
wages
well
there
is
my
thought
i
wish
to
communicate
it
to
men
who
have
a
care
for
more
than
food
and
clothing
and
who
will
exert
themselves
to
influence
those
about
them
grail
gazed
at
the
fire
the
earnest
words
wrought
in
him
that
were
possible
he
murmured
me
the
other
resumed
quickly
many
of
the
serious
people
whom
you
know
in
lambeth
ever
go
to
a
place
of
worship
gilbert
turned
his
eyes
inquiringly
suspiciously
was
egremont
about
to
preach
a
pietistic
revival
have
very
few
acquaintances
he
answered
i
know
that
religion
has
no
hold
upon
intelligent
working
men
in
london
is
the
admission
i
wanted
for
good
or
for
evil
it
has
passed
no
one
will
ever
restore
it
and
yet
it
is
a
religious
spirit
that
we
must
seek
to
revive
dogma
will
no
longer
help
us
pure
love
of
moral
and
intellectual
beauty
must
take
its
place
gilbert
smiled
at
a
thought
which
came
to
him
working
man
bible
he
said
his
sunday
newspaper
what
does
he
get
out
of
it
the
newspaper
is
the
very
voice
of
all
that
is
worst
in
our
civilisation
if
ever
there
is
in
one
column
a
pretence
of
higher
teaching
it
is
made
laughable
by
the
base
tendency
of
all
the
rest
the
newspaper
has
supplanted
the
book
every
scribbler
who
gets
a
square
inch
of
space
in
the
morning
journal
has
a
more
respectful
hearing
than
shakespeare
these
writers
are
tradesmen
and
with
all
their
power
they
cry
up
the
spirit
of
trade
till
the
influence
of
the
newspaper
declines
the
newspaper
as
we
now
know
it
our
state
will
grow
worse
grail
was
silent
egremont
had
worked
himself
to
a
fervour
which
showed
itself
in
his
unsteady
hands
and
tremulous
lips
had
not
meant
to
speak
of
this
yet
he
continued
hoped
to
surround
myself
with
a
few
friends
who
would
gradually
get
to
know
my
views
and
perhaps
think
they
were
worth
something
i
have
obeyed
an
impulse
in
opening
my
mind
to
you
i
feel
that
you
think
with
me
will
you
join
me
as
a
friend
and
work
on
with
me
for
the
founding
of
such
a
society
as
i
have
described
will
egremont
was
the
answer
walter
put
forth
his
hand
and
it
was
grasped
firmly
in
this
moment
he
was
equal
to
his
ambition
unwavering
exalted
the
pure
idealist
grail
too
forgot
his
private
troubles
and
tasted
the
strong
air
of
the
heights
which
it
is
granted
us
so
seldom
and
for
so
brief
a
season
to
tread
there
was
almost
colour
in
his
cheeks
and
his
eyes
had
a
light
as
of
dawn
have
much
yet
to
talk
of
said
egremont
as
he
rose
it
gets
late
and
i
must
keep
you
longer
will
you
come
here
some
evening
when
there
is
no
lecture
and
let
us
turn
over
our
ideas
together
i
shall
begin
at
once
to
think
of
the
library
it
will
make
a
centre
for
us
wo
it
and
remember
ackroyd
you
are
intimate
with
him
think
very
differently
of
many
things
said
grail
i
like
him
we
work
together
must
lose
him
he
has
the
bright
look
of
a
man
who
could
do
much
if
he
were
really
moved
persuade
him
to
come
and
see
me
on
sunday
night
they
shook
hands
again
and
grail
took
his
departure
egremont
still
stood
for
a
few
minutes
before
the
fire
then
he
extinguished
the
gas
locked
the
door
behind
him
and
went
forth
into
the
street
singing
to
himself
gilbert
turned
into
paradise
street
which
was
close
at
hand
he
had
decided
to
call
and
ask
for
ackroyd
on
his
way
home
the
latter
had
not
been
at
work
that
day
and
was
perhaps
ailing
for
some
time
he
had
seemed
out
of
sorts
intercourse
between
them
was
not
as
constant
as
formerly
grail
explained
this
as
due
to
ackroyd
disturbed
mood
another
result
of
which
was
seen
in
his
ceasing
to
attend
the
lecture
yet
in
gilbert
also
there
was
something
which
tended
to
weaken
the
intimacy
he
knew
well
enough
what
this
was
and
strove
against
it
but
not
with
great
success
ackroyd
lived
with
his
married
sister
who
let
half
her
house
to
lodgers
when
gilbert
knocked
at
the
door
it
was
she
who
opened
poole
was
a
buxom
young
woman
with
a
complexion
which
suggested
continual
activity
within
range
of
the
kitchen
fire
her
sleeves
were
always
rolled
up
to
her
elbow
and
at
whatever
moment
surprised
she
wore
an
apron
which
seemed
just
washed
and
ironed
she
knew
not
weariness
nor
discomfort
nor
discontent
and
her
flow
of
words
suggested
a
safety
valve
letting
off
superfluous
energy
mr
grail
she
said
peering
out
into
the
darkness
come
to
look
after
that
great
of
a
brother
of
mine
i
be
bound
come
downstairs
and
i
tell
him
you
here
you
may
well
wonder
what
become
of
him
ill
not
he
indeed
no
more
ill
than
i
am
it
only
his
laziness
he
wants
a
good
shaking
that
about
the
truth
of
it
mr
grail
she
led
him
down
into
the
kitchen
a
low
covered
with
linen
stood
before
a
great
glowing
fire
a
baby
lay
awake
in
a
swinging
cot
just
under
the
protruding
leaf
of
the
table
and
a
little
girl
of
three
was
sitting
in
and
shawl
on
a
stool
in
a
warm
corner
you
may
well
stare
resumed
poole
noticing
grail
glance
at
the
children
quarter
past
ten
and
neither
one
of
shut
an
eye
yet
nor
wo
do
till
their
father
comes
home
not
if
it
twelve
you
dare
to
laugh
miss
she
cried
to
the
little
one
on
the
stool
with
mock
wrath
idea
of
having
to
fetch
you
out
o
bed
just
for
peace
and
quietness
and
that
young
man
there
she
pointed
to
the
cradle
about
as
much
sleep
ill
him
as
there
is
in
that
clock
you
rascal
you
like
her
brother
she
had
the
northern
accent
still
lingering
in
her
speech
it
suited
with
her
brisk
hearty
ways
whilst
speaking
she
had
partly
moved
the
horse
from
the
fire
and
placed
a
chair
for
the
visitor
in
a
position
which
would
have
answered
tolerably
had
she
meant
to
roast
him
in
the
sulks
that
what
he
is
she
continued
returning
to
the
subject
of
luke
suppose
you
know
all
about
it
mr
grail
gilbert
seated
himself
and
poole
pretending
to
arrange
the
linen
stood
just
before
him
with
a
sly
smile
not
sure
that
i
do
he
replied
avoiding
her
look
she
lowered
her
voice
idea
of
a
great
lad
going
on
like
he
does
why
it
the
young
lady
that
lives
in
your
house
miss
trent
you
know
i
do
know
her
myself
no
doubt
she
wonderful
pretty
and
all
the
rest
of
it
but
that
sick
and
tired
of
hearing
about
her
my
husband
out
a
great
deal
at
night
of
course
and
luke
comes
and
sits
here
hours
by
the
clock
just
where
you
are
right
in
my
way
i
do
mean
in
my
way
i
talking
of
times
when
i
busy
well
there
he
sits
and
sometimes
he
be
that
low
it
enough
to
make
a
body
strangle
herself
with
her
other
times
he
talk
talk
talk
and
it
all
thyrza
trent
thyrza
trent
till
the
name
makes
my
ears
jingle
this
afternoon
i
could
put
up
with
it
so
i
told
him
he
was
a
great
big
baby
to
go
on
as
he
does
then
we
had
some
snappy
words
and
he
went
off
to
his
bedroom
and
would
have
any
tea
but
really
and
truly
i
do
know
what
come
to
him
he
says
he
take
to
drinking
and
he
does
a
deal
too
much
o
that
as
it
is
and
to
think
of
him
losing
days
from
his
work
now
do
just
tell
him
not
to
be
a
fool
mr
grail
with
difficulty
gilbert
found
an
opportunity
to
put
in
a
word
is
there
something
wrong
between
them
he
asked
with
a
forced
smile
why
does
he
talk
about
it
to
you
i
used
to
hear
just
a
word
or
two
but
there
been
no
mention
of
her
for
a
long
time
may
think
yourself
lucky
then
that
all
can
say
why
she
would
have
anything
to
say
to
him
and
i
do
see
what
he
got
to
complain
of
he
admits
she
told
him
from
the
first
she
did
care
a
bit
for
him
as
if
there
was
plenty
of
other
lasses
luke
was
always
such
a
softy
about
but
i
never
knew
him
have
such
a
turn
as
this
i
just
go
and
tell
him
you
here
he
gone
to
bed
he
he
sits
in
the
cold
half
the
night
just
to
make
people
sorry
for
him
he
does
get
much
pity
from
me
the
silly
fellow
she
ran
up
the
stairs
grail
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
fell
into
a
reverie
it
did
not
seem
a
pleasant
one
in
a
few
minutes
poole
was
heard
returning
behind
her
came
a
heavier
foot
ackroyd
certainly
looked
far
from
well
but
had
assumed
a
gay
air
which
he
exaggerated
to
see
if
i
hanged
myself
old
man
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
yet
i
had
the
toothache
and
the
headache
and
lord
knows
what
now
i
feel
hungry
we
have
some
supper
together
give
me
a
jug
maggie
and
i
get
some
beer
sit
down
she
replied
run
out
and
fetch
it
what
the
good
of
a
jug
like
that
he
roared
watching
her
gallon
or
so
wo
be
a
drop
too
much
for
me
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
and
stretched
his
legs
to
the
lecture
he
asked
as
his
sister
left
the
room
gilbert
replied
his
wonted
quietness
contrasting
with
the
other
noise
egremont
been
asking
me
about
you
disappointed
that
you
left
him
help
it
i
held
out
as
long
as
i
could
it
is
my
line
besides
nothing
my
line
just
now
so
you
had
a
talk
with
him
eh
a
talk
i
sha
forget
there
are
not
many
men
like
mr
egremont
gilbert
had
it
on
his
lips
to
speak
of
the
library
project
but
a
doubt
as
to
whether
he
might
not
be
betraying
confidence
checked
him
wants
you
to
go
and
see
him
at
the
he
continued
on
sunday
after
the
lecture
or
any
evening
that
suits
you
will
you
go
luke
shook
his
head
what
the
good
wish
you
would
ackroyd
said
gilbert
bending
forward
and
speaking
with
earnestness
be
glad
of
it
afterwards
he
said
i
was
to
ask
you
to
go
and
have
a
smoke
with
him
by
the
fire
you
need
be
afraid
of
a
sermon
you
see
besides
you
know
he
is
that
kind
of
man
i
sha
go
old
man
returned
the
other
with
resolution
liked
his
lectures
well
enough
as
far
as
they
went
but
they
not
the
kind
of
thing
to
suit
me
nowadays
if
i
go
and
talk
to
him
bound
to
go
to
the
lectures
what
the
good
what
the
good
of
anything
gilbert
became
silent
the
little
girl
on
the
stool
who
had
been
moving
restlessly
suddenly
said
take
me
on
your
lap
of
course
i
will
little
un
luke
replied
with
a
sudden
affectionateness
one
would
not
have
expected
of
him
me
a
kiss
who
that
sitting
there
eh
say
mr
grail
in
the
midst
of
this
poole
reappeared
with
the
jug
foaming
indeed
so
where
you
are
she
exclaimed
with
her
vivacious
emphasis
looking
at
the
child
nice
thing
for
you
to
be
nursed
at
this
hour
o
night
now
just
one
glass
grail
it
a
bitter
night
just
a
glass
to
walk
on
gilbert
pleased
her
by
drinking
what
she
offered
ackroyd
had
recommenced
his
uproarious
mirthfulness
wish
you
could
persuade
your
brother
to
go
to
the
lectures
again
poole
said
gilbert
misses
a
great
deal
he
miss
a
good
deal
more
she
replied
he
does
soon
come
to
his
senses
nay
it
no
good
o
me
talking
he
used
to
be
a
sensible
lad
that
is
he
could
be
if
he
liked
gilbert
gave
his
hand
for
still
hope
you
go
on
sunday
night
he
said
seriously
ackroyd
shook
his
head
again
then
tossed
the
child
into
the
air
and
began
singing
he
did
not
offer
to
accompany
grail
up
to
the
door
chapter
ix
a
golden
prospect
it
wanted
a
week
to
christmas
for
many
days
the
weather
had
been
as
bad
as
it
can
be
even
in
london
windows
glimmered
at
noon
with
the
sickly
ray
of
gas
or
lamp
the
roads
were
trodden
into
viscid
foulness
all
night
the
droppings
of
a
pestilent
rain
were
doleful
upon
the
roof
and
only
the
change
from
a
black
to
a
yellow
sky
told
that
the
sun
was
risen
no
wonder
thyrza
was
ailing
it
was
nothing
serious
the
inevitable
cold
had
clung
to
her
and
become
feverish
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
stay
at
home
for
a
day
or
two
lydia
made
her
hours
of
work
as
short
as
possible
hastening
to
get
back
to
her
sister
but
fortunately
there
was
a
friend
always
at
hand
grail
could
not
have
been
more
anxious
about
a
child
of
her
own
her
attendance
was
of
the
kind
which
inspires
trust
lydia
always
fretting
herself
into
the
extreme
of
nervousness
if
her
dear
one
lost
for
a
day
the
wonted
health
was
thankful
she
had
not
to
depend
on
jarmey
offices
thyrza
had
spent
a
day
in
bed
but
could
now
sit
by
the
fire
her
chair
came
from
the
grails
parlour
and
was
the
very
one
which
had
always
seemed
to
her
so
comfortable
her
wish
that
lyddy
should
sit
in
it
had
at
length
been
gratified
it
was
seven
on
friday
evening
the
table
was
drawn
near
to
thyrza
chair
and
thyrza
was
engaged
in
counting
out
silver
coins
which
she
took
from
a
capacious
old
purse
lydia
leaned
on
the
table
opposite
i
sure
i
saw
a
very
nice
overcoat
marked
shillings
not
long
ago
but
we
ca
buy
one
without
knowing
grandad
measure
but
you
know
it
near
enough
i
think
enough
but
i
want
it
to
look
nice
i
wonder
whether
i
could
take
a
measure
without
him
knowing
it
if
i
could
manage
to
get
behind
him
and
just
measure
across
the
shoulders
i
think
that
do
thyrza
laughed
now
he
sure
to
be
sitting
with
the
bowers
take
the
tape
and
try
i
take
a
bit
of
string
then
he
would
think
anything
if
he
saw
it
lydia
put
on
her
hat
and
jacket
be
back
as
soon
as
ever
i
can
play
with
the
money
like
a
good
baby
you
sure
you
quite
warm
thyrza
was
wrapped
in
a
large
shawl
which
hooded
over
her
head
lydia
had
taken
incredible
pains
to
stop
every
possible
draught
at
door
and
window
a
cheerful
fire
threw
its
glow
upon
the
invalid
face
like
a
toast
just
look
up
at
the
shop
next
to
isaac
lyddy
there
was
a
sort
of
brownish
coat
with
laps
over
the
pockets
it
was
hanging
just
by
the
door
we
must
get
a
few
more
shillings
if
it
makes
all
the
difference
must
we
see
lydia
went
her
way
for
a
wonder
there
was
no
fog
tonight
but
the
street
lamps
glistened
on
wet
pavements
and
vehicles
as
they
rattled
along
sent
to
either
side
in
passing
through
lambeth
walk
lydia
stopped
at
the
clothing
shop
of
which
thyrza
had
spoken
the
particular
brownish
coat
had
seemingly
been
carried
off
by
a
purchaser
but
she
was
glad
to
notice
one
or
two
garments
of
very
respectable
appearance
which
came
within
the
sum
at
her
command
she
passed
on
into
paradise
street
and
entered
bower
shop
in
the
parlour
the
portly
bower
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
he
was
speaking
oracularly
and
at
lydia
entrance
looked
up
with
some
annoyance
at
being
interrupted
boddy
sat
in
his
accustomed
corner
bower
arrayed
in
the
grandeur
suitable
to
a
winter
evening
was
condescending
to
sew
out
lydia
asked
as
she
looked
round
my
dear
replied
bower
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
at
a
prayer
meetin
as
per
that
the
third
night
this
blessed
week
i
with
goin
to
chapel
but
like
everything
else
it
ought
to
be
done
in
moderation
mary
gettin
beyond
everything
i
believe
in
makin
such
a
fuss
o
religion
you
can
be
religious
in
your
mind
without
sayin
prayers
an
singin
all
the
week
long
there
the
sunday
for
that
an
i
ca
see
as
it
pleasin
to
god
neither
to
do
so
much
of
it
at
other
times
now
suppose
i
give
somebody
credit
in
the
shop
on
the
understandin
as
they
come
an
pay
their
bill
once
a
week
do
you
think
i
should
like
to
have
lookin
in
two
or
three
times
every
day
an
cryin
out
oh
bower
i
do
forget
as
i
owe
you
so
and
so
much
be
sure
i
shall
come
an
pay
on
saturday
if
they
did
that
i
should
precious
soon
begin
to
think
there
was
something
wrong
else
they
their
tongues
an
leave
it
to
be
understood
as
they
was
honest
why
an
every
bit
the
same
with
religion
boddy
listened
gravely
to
this
and
had
the
air
of
probing
the
suggested
analogy
he
had
a
bad
cold
poor
old
man
and
for
the
moment
it
made
him
look
as
if
he
indulged
too
freely
in
ardent
beverages
his
nose
was
red
and
his
eyes
were
watery
the
little
un
my
dear
he
asked
as
lydia
took
a
seat
by
him
she
much
better
grandad
grail
is
so
kind
to
her
you
would
believe
she
be
all
right
again
by
monday
i
think
grail
kind
to
her
is
she
remarked
bower
why
getting
great
friends
with
the
grails
miss
lydia
we
really
are
do
you
see
much
of
grail
himself
not
much
we
sometimes
have
tea
with
them
both
you
do
he
a
very
decent
quiet
fellow
is
grail
i
dare
say
he
tells
you
something
about
egremont
now
and
then
bower
put
the
question
in
a
casual
way
in
truth
it
was
designed
to
elicit
information
which
he
much
desired
he
knew
that
for
some
time
grail
had
been
on
a
new
footing
with
the
lecturer
that
the
two
often
remained
together
after
the
class
had
dispersed
it
was
a
privilege
which
he
regarded
disapprovingly
because
it
lessened
his
own
dignity
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
men
he
wondered
what
the
subject
of
these
private
conversations
might
be
there
had
seemed
to
him
something
of
mystery
in
grail
manner
when
he
was
plied
with
a
friendly
inquiry
or
two
heard
him
speak
of
the
lectures
said
lydia
says
he
enjoys
them
very
much
be
sure
yes
they
very
fair
lectures
very
fair
in
their
way
i
do
know
as
i
cared
quite
so
much
for
lately
as
i
did
at
first
i
felt
he
was
falling
off
a
little
i
gave
him
a
hint
a
few
weeks
ago
just
told
him
in
a
quiet
way
as
i
thought
he
was
going
too
far
into
things
that
were
very
interesting
but
he
did
seem
quite
to
see
it
it
always
the
way
with
young
men
of
his
kind
when
you
give
them
a
bit
of
advice
it
makes
them
obstinate
well
he
see
when
he
begins
again
after
christmas
thomas
and
linwood
are
giving
it
up
and
i
shall
be
rather
surprised
if
johnson
holds
out
for
another
course
i
suppose
you
go
mr
bower
said
lydia
bower
stuck
his
forefingers
into
his
waistcoat
pockets
held
his
head
as
one
who
muses
clicked
with
his
tongue
shall
see
he
replied
with
a
judicial
air
do
like
to
give
the
young
feller
up
you
see
i
may
say
as
it
was
me
put
him
on
the
idea
we
had
a
lot
of
talk
about
one
thing
and
another
one
day
at
the
works
and
a
hint
of
mine
set
him
off
i
should
like
to
make
the
lectures
successful
i
believe
they
a
good
thing
if
they
are
properly
carried
out
i
a
believer
in
education
it
the
educated
men
as
get
on
in
the
world
teach
a
man
to
use
his
brains
and
soon
be
worth
double
wages
but
egremont
must
keep
up
to
the
mark
if
he
to
have
my
support
i
shall
have
to
have
a
word
or
two
with
him
before
he
begins
again
i
passed
him
in
kennington
road
just
now
i
wonder
what
he
doing
about
here
at
this
time
been
to
the
works
perhaps
whilst
the
portly
man
thus
delivered
himself
lydia
let
her
arm
rest
on
boddy
shoulder
it
was
a
caress
which
he
sometimes
received
from
her
he
looked
round
at
her
affectionately
then
continued
to
pay
attention
to
the
weighty
words
which
fell
from
bower
bower
who
was
loss
impressed
by
her
husband
utterances
bent
over
her
sewing
in
this
way
lydia
was
able
craftily
to
secure
the
measurement
she
needed
and
having
got
this
she
was
anxious
to
be
back
with
thyrza
suppose
it
no
use
waiting
for
mary
she
said
rising
do
suppose
she
be
back
not
before
nine
bower
replied
you
want
her
no
it
do
any
time
i
think
of
it
said
bower
letting
her
sewing
fall
upon
her
lap
and
settling
the
upper
part
of
her
stout
body
in
an
attitude
of
dignity
and
your
sister
come
an
eat
your
christmas
dinner
with
us
lydia
east
down
her
eyes
very
kind
of
you
bower
but
i
sure
i
do
know
whether
thyrza
be
well
enough
i
must
be
very
careful
of
her
for
a
time
well
you
see
it
only
be
a
quiet
little
dinner
this
year
you
know
there
places
kep
for
you
lydia
again
expressed
her
thanks
then
took
leave
as
she
left
the
shop
she
heard
bower
voice
again
raised
in
impressive
oratory
on
entering
the
house
in
walnut
tree
walk
she
found
grail
just
descending
the
stairs
the
old
lady
never
spoke
above
her
breath
at
such
casual
meetings
outside
her
own
door
in
for
a
minute
she
whispered
lydia
followed
her
into
the
parlour
gilbert
was
settled
for
the
evening
at
the
table
a
volume
lent
by
egremont
lay
before
him
and
he
was
making
notes
from
it
at
lydia
entrance
he
rose
and
spoke
a
word
then
resumed
his
reading
just
taken
thyrza
a
little
morsel
of
jelly
i
made
this
afternoon
grail
said
apart
to
the
girl
sure
she
looks
better
good
you
are
grail
yes
she
does
look
better
but
i
could
have
believed
a
day
or
two
have
made
her
so
weak
i
let
her
go
out
before
christmas
i
do
think
you
ought
my
dear
as
grail
spoke
the
knocker
of
the
sounded
an
unusual
summons
a
not
loud
indeed
but
distinct
from
the
knocks
wont
to
be
heard
here
and
jarmey
are
both
out
said
lydia
gone
to
the
theatre
perhaps
it
for
you
mrs
grail
that
not
at
all
likely
go
lydia
opened
a
gentleman
stood
without
he
inquired
in
a
pleasant
voice
if
grail
was
at
home
think
so
lydia
said
you
please
wait
a
minute
she
hurried
back
to
the
parlour
a
gentleman
wants
to
see
grail
she
whispered
with
the
momentary
excitement
which
any
little
occurrence
produces
in
those
who
live
a
life
void
of
surprises
and
she
glanced
at
gilbert
who
had
heard
what
she
said
he
rose
wonder
whether
it
egremont
thank
you
miss
trent
i
go
to
the
door
lydia
escaped
up
the
stairs
gilbert
went
out
into
the
passage
and
his
surmise
was
confirmed
egremont
was
there
sheltering
himself
under
an
umbrella
from
rain
which
was
once
more
beginning
to
fell
i
have
a
word
with
you
he
said
with
friendly
freedom
should
have
written
but
i
had
to
pass
so
near
very
glad
will
you
come
in
it
was
the
first
time
that
egremont
had
been
at
the
house
gilbert
conducted
him
into
the
parlour
and
took
from
him
his
hat
and
umbrella
is
my
mother
he
said
egremont
mother
you
be
glad
to
see
him
the
old
lady
regarded
walter
with
courteous
curiosity
and
bowed
to
him
a
few
friendly
words
were
exchanged
then
egremont
said
to
grail
you
had
been
in
i
should
have
left
a
message
asking
you
to
meet
me
afternoon
grail
was
about
to
leave
the
room
egremont
begged
her
to
remain
only
a
piece
of
news
concerning
our
library
scheme
i
think
found
a
building
that
will
suit
us
do
you
know
a
school
in
brook
street
connected
with
a
wesleyan
chapel
somewhere
about
here
gilbert
said
that
he
knew
it
his
mother
also
murmured
recognition
be
to
let
at
the
end
of
next
quarter
they
building
themselves
a
larger
place
i
heard
about
it
this
afternoon
and
as
i
was
told
that
evening
classes
are
held
there
i
thought
i
come
and
have
a
look
at
the
place
at
last
it
is
something
like
what
we
want
could
you
meet
me
there
say
at
three
afternoon
so
that
we
could
see
it
together
in
daylight
if
daylight
be
granted
us
grail
expressed
his
readiness
were
reading
waiter
went
on
with
a
glance
at
the
table
must
waste
your
time
he
rose
but
gilbert
said
should
be
glad
if
you
could
stay
a
few
minutes
perhaps
you
time
yes
what
are
you
busy
with
half
an
hour
talk
followed
of
course
mainly
of
books
egremont
looked
over
the
volumes
on
the
shelves
those
who
love
such
topics
will
know
how
readily
gossip
spun
itself
from
that
centre
he
was
pleased
with
grail
home
it
was
very
much
as
he
had
liked
to
picture
it
since
he
had
known
that
gilbert
lived
with
his
mother
grail
sat
and
listened
to
all
that
was
said
a
placid
smile
on
her
smooth
face
at
length
egremont
declared
that
he
was
consuming
his
friend
evening
you
let
me
come
some
other
night
he
said
as
he
took
up
his
hat
know
very
few
people
indeed
who
care
to
talk
of
these
things
in
the
way
i
like
gilbert
came
back
from
the
door
with
a
look
of
pleasure
is
he
a
fine
fellow
mother
i
so
glad
you
seen
him
seems
a
very
pleasant
young
man
indeed
grail
replied
not
quite
the
picture
i
made
of
him
but
his
way
of
speaking
makes
you
like
him
from
the
very
first
never
heard
him
say
a
word
yet
that
did
sound
genuine
gilbert
added
speaks
what
he
thinks
and
you
wo
find
many
men
who
make
you
feel
that
and
he
has
a
mind
i
wish
you
could
hear
one
of
his
lectures
he
speaks
in
just
the
same
easy
running
way
and
constantly
says
things
one
would
be
glad
to
remember
they
do
understand
him
bower
and
bunce
and
the
others
they
do
his
words
as
they
ought
to
i
afraid
he
only
have
two
or
three
when
he
begins
again
grail
turned
presently
to
a
different
topic
you
believe
gilbert
she
murmured
two
girls
have
saved
up
more
than
a
pound
to
buy
that
poor
old
boddy
a
for
christmas
when
i
went
up
with
the
jelly
thyrza
had
the
money
out
on
the
table
she
told
me
as
a
great
secret
what
it
was
for
things
they
are
both
of
them
gilbert
assented
silently
his
mother
seldom
elicited
a
word
from
him
on
the
subject
of
the
sisters
on
the
following
afternoon
gilbert
and
egremont
met
at
the
appointed
place
just
as
three
was
striking
already
night
had
begun
to
close
in
a
sad
wind
moaned
about
the
streets
and
the
cold
grey
of
the
sky
was
patched
about
with
dim
shifting
black
clouds
egremont
was
full
of
cheeriness
as
he
shook
hands
a
wonderful
people
we
are
he
exclaimed
have
developed
even
so
much
civilisation
in
a
climate
such
as
this
the
school
building
which
they
were
about
to
inspect
stood
at
the
junction
of
two
streets
which
consisted
chiefly
of
dwellings
in
the
nature
of
things
it
was
ugly
three
steps
led
up
to
the
narrow
entrance
which
as
well
as
the
windows
on
the
ground
floor
was
surrounded
with
a
wholly
inappropriate
pointed
arch
iron
railings
ran
along
the
two
sides
which
abutted
upon
pavements
and
by
the
door
was
a
tall
iron
support
for
a
lamp
probably
it
had
never
been
put
to
its
use
there
was
only
one
upper
storey
and
the
roof
was
crowned
with
a
small
stack
of
hideous
metal
chimneys
must
go
round
to
the
caretaker
house
said
egremont
when
they
had
cast
their
eyes
over
the
face
of
the
edifice
the
way
was
by
a
narrow
passage
between
the
school
itself
and
the
whitewashed
side
of
an
adjacent
house
this
led
them
into
a
small
paved
yard
upon
which
looked
the
windows
of
the
caretaker
dwelling
which
was
the
rear
portion
of
the
school
building
a
knock
at
the
door
brought
a
very
dirty
and
very
asthmatical
old
woman
who
appeared
to
resent
their
visit
when
egremont
expressed
his
desire
to
go
over
the
school
she
muttered
querulously
what
was
understood
to
be
an
invitation
to
enter
followed
by
gilbert
egremont
was
conducted
along
a
passage
the
steps
snarled
their
guide
egremont
had
already
stumbled
over
an
ascent
of
two
when
the
warning
was
given
but
at
the
same
moment
a
door
was
thrown
open
giving
a
view
of
the
main
schoolroom
swep
out
yet
remarked
the
old
woman
could
tell
as
nobody
was
you
can
complain
to
them
if
you
like
i
used
to
it
from
all
sorts
an
for
much
longer
praise
goodness
though
there
nothink
before
me
but
the
parish
when
the
time
does
come
egremont
glanced
at
the
strange
creature
in
surprise
but
it
seemed
better
to
say
nothing
he
began
to
speak
of
the
aspects
of
the
room
with
his
companion
the
place
was
cheerless
beyond
description
in
a
large
grate
the
last
embers
of
a
fire
were
darkening
the
air
was
chill
and
looking
up
to
the
ceiling
one
saw
floating
scraps
of
mist
which
had
somehow
come
in
from
the
street
the
lower
half
of
each
window
was
guarded
with
of
thin
wire
the
windows
themselves
were
grimy
and
would
have
made
it
dusk
within
even
on
a
clear
day
the
whitewash
of
the
ceiling
was
dark
and
much
cracked
benches
and
desks
covered
half
the
floor
there
were
and
other
mechanical
appliances
for
teaching
and
on
the
walls
hung
maps
and
diagrams
walls
seem
quite
dry
observed
walter
is
a
great
point
they
laid
their
palms
against
the
plaster
the
old
woman
stood
with
one
hand
pressed
against
her
bosom
the
other
behind
her
back
her
head
was
bent
she
seemed
to
pay
no
kind
of
attention
to
what
was
said
room
here
for
some
thousands
of
volumes
egremont
said
moving
to
one
of
the
windows
will
serve
tolerably
as
a
too
nothing
like
as
large
as
it
ought
to
be
of
course
but
we
must
be
content
to
feel
our
way
to
better
things
gilbert
nodded
in
spite
of
his
companion
resolute
cheerfulness
he
felt
a
distressing
dejection
creep
upon
him
as
he
stood
in
the
cold
darkening
room
he
could
not
feel
the
interest
and
hope
which
hitherto
this
project
had
inspired
him
with
the
figure
of
the
old
caretaker
impressed
him
painfully
for
any
movement
she
made
she
might
have
been
asleep
the
regular
sound
of
her
heavy
breathing
was
quite
audible
and
vapour
rose
from
her
lips
upon
the
air
do
you
think
egremont
asked
when
grail
remained
mute
should
think
it
will
do
very
well
what
is
there
upstairs
we
should
use
those
for
lectures
let
us
go
up
the
old
woman
walked
before
them
to
a
door
opposite
that
by
which
they
had
entered
they
found
themselves
in
a
small
vestibule
out
of
which
on
one
hand
a
door
led
into
a
while
on
the
other
ascended
a
flight
of
stone
stairs
there
was
nothing
noticeable
in
the
rooms
above
the
windows
here
were
also
very
dirty
and
mist
floated
below
the
ceilings
the
caretaker
had
remained
below
contenting
herself
with
indicating
the
way
seem
disappointed
walter
said
he
himself
had
ceased
to
talk
he
felt
cold
and
uncomfortable
no
indeed
i
not
grail
hastened
to
reply
think
it
is
as
good
a
place
as
you
could
have
found
do
see
it
under
very
inspiriting
conditions
fire
and
light
and
comfortable
furniture
would
make
a
wonderful
difference
even
on
a
day
like
this
gilbert
reproached
himself
for
taking
so
coldly
his
friend
generous
zeal
books
still
more
he
replied
room
below
will
be
a
grand
sight
with
shelves
all
round
the
walls
i
must
make
further
inquiries
but
i
think
the
place
will
suit
us
they
descended
their
footsteps
ringing
on
the
stone
and
echoing
up
to
the
roof
the
old
woman
still
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
her
head
bent
the
hand
against
her
side
you
go
out
here
she
asked
do
you
want
to
see
anythink
else
should
like
to
see
the
back
part
again
egremont
replied
she
led
them
across
the
schoolroom
through
the
dark
passage
and
into
a
small
room
which
had
the
distant
semblance
of
a
parlour
here
she
lit
a
lamp
then
without
speaking
guided
them
over
the
house
of
which
she
appeared
to
be
the
only
inhabitant
there
were
seven
rooms
only
three
of
them
contained
any
furniture
then
they
all
returned
to
the
comfortless
parlour
chest
is
bad
egremont
remarked
looking
curiously
at
the
woman
i
dessay
it
is
was
the
ungracious
reply
i
do
think
we
need
trouble
you
any
more
at
present
but
i
shall
probably
have
to
come
again
in
a
day
or
two
dessay
you
find
me
here
feeling
better
i
hope
the
weather
gives
you
much
trouble
no
doubt
he
held
half
a
crown
to
her
she
regarded
it
clasped
it
in
the
hand
which
was
against
her
bosom
and
at
length
dropped
a
curtsy
though
without
speaking
a
poor
crabbed
old
creature
egremont
exclaimed
as
they
walked
away
should
feel
relieved
if
i
knew
that
she
went
off
at
once
to
the
warmth
of
the
opposite
she
has
a
very
cheerful
home
but
it
can
be
made
a
very
different
house
it
has
fallen
into
such
neglect
wait
till
spring
sunshine
and
the
paperhangers
invade
the
place
they
issued
into
a
main
street
and
after
a
little
further
talk
shook
hands
and
parted
that
night
and
through
the
sunday
that
followed
gilbert
continued
to
suffer
even
more
than
his
wont
from
mental
dreariness
grail
was
unable
to
draw
him
into
conversation
about
four
she
said
i
ask
lydia
and
thyrza
to
come
and
have
tea
with
us
gilbert
he
looked
up
absently
they
were
here
last
sunday
my
dear
but
i
think
they
like
to
come
and
i
sure
i
like
to
have
them
us
leave
it
till
next
sunday
mother
you
do
mind
i
feel
i
must
be
alone
it
was
a
most
unusual
thing
for
gilbert
to
offer
opposition
when
his
mother
had
expressed
a
desire
for
anything
grail
at
once
said
dare
say
you
right
my
dear
next
sunday
be
better
the
next
morning
he
went
to
his
work
through
a
fog
so
dense
that
it
was
with
difficulty
he
followed
the
familiar
way
lamps
were
mere
lurid
blotches
in
the
foul
air
perceptible
only
when
close
at
hand
the
footfall
of
invisible
men
and
women
hurrying
to
factories
made
a
muffled
ghastly
sound
harsh
bells
summoned
through
the
darkness
the
voice
of
pitiless
taskmasters
to
whom
all
was
indifferent
save
the
hour
of
toil
gilbert
was
racked
with
headache
bodily
suffering
made
him
as
void
of
intellectual
desire
as
the
meanest
labourer
then
going
forth
to
earn
bread
he
longed
for
nothing
more
than
to
lie
down
and
lose
consciousness
of
the
burden
of
life
then
came
christmas
eve
the
weather
had
changed
there
was
frost
in
the
air
and
the
light
of
stars
made
a
shimmer
upon
the
black
vault
gilbert
always
gave
this
season
to
companionship
with
his
mother
about
seven
they
were
talking
quietly
together
of
memories
light
and
grave
of
gilbert
boyhood
of
his
sister
who
was
dead
of
his
father
who
was
dead
then
came
a
pause
whilst
both
were
silently
busy
with
the
irrecoverable
past
grail
broke
the
silence
to
say
a
lonely
man
gilbert
no
not
lonely
mother
i
might
be
but
for
you
you
lonely
my
dear
it
poor
company
that
i
can
give
you
i
should
like
to
see
you
with
a
happier
look
on
your
face
before
i
die
gilbert
had
no
reply
ready
think
too
poorly
of
yourself
his
mother
resumed
you
always
have
done
but
there
people
have
a
better
judgment
of
you
you
thought
that
somebody
looks
always
very
pleased
when
you
read
or
talk
and
sits
very
quiet
when
you
nothing
to
say
and
always
says
to
you
so
prettily
mother
do
speak
like
that
i
thought
nothing
of
the
kind
put
that
out
of
your
head
never
speak
of
it
again
his
voice
was
not
untender
but
very
grave
the
lines
of
his
face
hardened
grail
glanced
at
him
timidly
and
became
mute
a
loud
double
knock
told
that
the
postman
had
delivered
a
letter
at
the
house
whilst
the
two
still
sat
in
silence
jarmey
tapped
at
their
door
and
said
letter
for
you
mr
grail
egremont
said
gilbert
as
he
resumed
his
seat
and
opened
the
envelope
about
the
library
i
expect
he
read
to
himself
dear
grail
i
have
decided
to
take
the
school
building
on
a
lease
of
seven
years
after
again
carefully
examining
it
and
finding
it
still
to
my
mind
it
will
be
free
at
the
end
of
march
by
that
time
i
hope
to
have
sketched
out
something
of
a
rudimentary
catalogue
and
before
summer
the
library
should
be
open
asked
you
to
come
and
look
over
this
place
with
me
because
i
had
a
project
in
my
mind
with
reference
to
the
library
which
concerns
yourself
i
lay
it
before
you
in
a
letter
that
you
may
think
it
over
quietly
and
reply
at
your
leisure
i
wish
to
offer
you
the
position
of
librarian
i
am
sure
i
could
not
find
anyone
better
suited
for
the
post
and
certainly
there
is
no
man
whom
i
should
like
so
well
to
see
occupying
it
i
propose
that
the
salary
be
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
with
free
tenancy
of
the
at
present
so
dolorously
occupied
i
am
sure
it
can
be
made
a
comfortable
abode
and
of
course
gas
and
fuel
i
should
make
arrangements
for
the
necessary
cleaning
with
some
person
of
the
neighbourhood
your
own
duties
would
be
solely
those
of
librarian
and
superintendent
library
should
be
open
i
think
from
ten
to
ten
for
i
want
to
lose
no
possibility
of
usefulness
if
one
loafer
be
tempted
to
come
in
and
read
the
day
object
is
gained
these
hours
are
of
course
too
long
for
you
alone
i
would
provide
you
with
an
assistant
so
that
you
could
assure
for
yourself
let
us
say
four
hours
free
out
of
the
twelve
but
details
would
be
easily
arranged
between
us
sunday
must
be
a
day
of
closing
to
make
it
so
would
be
to
deprive
ourselves
of
the
greatest
opportunity
your
freedom
for
one
entire
day
in
the
week
should
be
guaranteed
offer
this
because
i
should
like
to
have
you
working
with
me
and
because
i
believe
that
such
work
would
be
more
to
your
taste
than
that
in
which
you
are
now
occupied
it
would
moreover
leave
you
a
good
deal
of
time
for
study
we
are
not
likely
to
be
overwhelmed
with
readers
and
borrowers
during
the
daytime
but
you
will
consider
the
proposal
precisely
as
you
would
do
if
it
came
from
a
stranger
and
will
accept
or
reject
it
as
you
see
fit
leave
town
for
about
a
week
will
you
write
to
me
at
the
end
of
that
time
always
yours
my
dear
grail
egremont
grail
showed
no
curiosity
about
the
letter
the
subject
of
the
interrupted
conversation
held
her
musing
when
gilbert
had
folded
the
sheets
and
in
the
manner
of
one
who
receives
few
letters
returned
it
to
its
envelope
he
said
it
about
the
library
he
taken
the
house
for
seven
years
his
mother
murmured
an
expression
of
interest
for
another
minute
the
clock
on
the
ticked
loud
then
gilbert
rose
and
without
saying
anything
went
out
he
entered
his
bedroom
the
darkness
was
complete
but
he
moved
with
the
certainty
of
habit
to
a
chair
by
the
head
of
the
bed
and
there
seated
himself
presently
he
felt
a
painful
surging
in
his
throat
then
a
gush
of
warm
tears
forced
its
way
to
his
eyes
it
cost
him
a
great
effort
to
resist
the
tendency
to
sob
aloud
he
was
hot
and
cold
alternately
and
trembled
as
though
a
fever
were
coming
upon
him
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
lit
the
candle
and
after
a
glance
at
himself
in
the
glass
bathed
his
face
then
he
took
down
his
overcoat
from
the
door
and
put
it
on
his
hat
too
he
took
and
went
to
the
parlour
have
to
go
out
mother
he
said
standing
at
the
door
be
back
by
well
my
dear
was
the
quiet
reply
he
walked
out
to
the
edge
of
the
pavement
and
stood
a
moment
as
if
in
doubt
as
to
his
direction
then
he
looked
at
the
upper
windows
of
the
house
as
we
saw
him
do
one
night
half
a
year
ago
there
was
a
light
this
time
in
the
sisters
room
he
turned
towards
lambeth
walk
the
market
of
christmas
eve
was
flaring
and
clamorous
the
odours
of
burning
naphtha
and
fried
fish
were
pungent
on
the
wind
he
walked
a
short
distance
among
the
crowd
then
found
the
noise
oppressive
and
turned
into
a
as
he
did
so
a
street
organ
began
to
play
in
front
of
a
close
by
grail
drew
near
there
were
children
forming
a
dance
and
he
stood
to
watch
them
do
you
know
that
music
of
the
obscure
ways
to
which
children
dance
not
if
you
have
only
heard
it
ground
to
your
ears
affliction
beneath
your
windows
in
the
square
to
hear
it
aright
you
must
stand
in
the
darkness
of
such
a
as
this
and
for
the
moment
be
at
one
with
those
who
dwell
around
in
the
houses
in
the
dim
burrows
of
poverty
in
the
unmapped
haunts
of
the
then
you
will
know
the
significance
of
that
vulgar
clanging
of
melody
a
pathos
of
which
you
did
not
dream
will
touch
you
and
therein
the
secret
of
hidden
london
will
be
half
revealed
the
life
of
men
who
toil
without
hope
yet
with
the
hunger
of
an
unshaped
desire
of
women
in
whom
the
sweetness
of
their
sex
is
perishing
under
labour
and
misery
the
laugh
the
song
of
the
girl
who
strives
to
enjoy
her
year
or
two
of
youthful
vigour
knowing
the
darkness
of
the
years
to
come
the
careless
defiance
of
the
youth
who
feels
his
blood
and
revolts
against
the
lot
which
would
tame
it
all
that
is
purely
human
in
these
darkened
multitudes
speaks
to
you
as
you
listen
it
is
the
striving
of
a
nature
which
knows
not
what
it
would
attain
which
deforms
a
true
thought
by
gross
expression
which
clutches
at
the
beautiful
and
soils
it
with
foul
hands
the
children
were
dirty
and
ragged
several
of
them
barefooted
nearly
all
but
they
danced
with
noisy
merriment
one
there
was
a
little
girl
on
crutches
incapable
of
taking
a
partner
she
stumped
round
and
round
circling
upon
the
pavement
till
giddiness
came
upon
her
and
she
had
to
fall
back
and
lean
against
the
wall
laughing
aloud
at
her
weakness
gilbert
stepped
up
to
her
and
put
a
penny
into
her
hand
then
before
she
had
recovered
from
her
surprise
passed
onwards
he
came
out
at
length
by
lambeth
parish
church
which
looks
upon
the
river
the
bells
were
ringing
a
harsh
peal
of
four
notes
unchangingly
repeated
thence
he
went
forward
on
to
lambeth
bridge
unsightliest
of
all
bridges
crossing
thames
the
red
hue
of
its
iron
superstructure
which
in
daylight
only
enhances
the
meanness
of
its
appearance
at
night
invests
it
with
a
certain
grim
severity
the
archway
with
its
bolted
metal
plates
its
cables
with
the
yellowness
of
the
which
it
supports
might
be
the
entrance
to
some
fastness
of
ignoble
misery
the
road
is
narrow
and
after
nightfall
has
but
little
traffic
gilbert
walked
as
far
as
the
middle
of
the
bridge
then
leaned
upon
the
parapet
and
looked
northwards
the
tide
was
running
out
it
swept
darkly
onwards
to
the
span
of
westminster
bridge
whose
crescent
of
lights
it
repeated
in
long
unsteady
rays
along
the
base
of
the
houses
of
parliament
the
few
sparse
lamps
contrasted
with
the
line
of
brightness
on
the
embankment
opposite
the
houses
themselves
rose
grandly
in
obscure
magnitude
the
beaconed
with
two
red
circles
against
the
black
sky
the
greater
tower
stood
and
between
them
were
the
dim
pinnacles
multiplied
in
shadowy
grace
farther
away
gilbert
could
just
discern
a
low
grey
shape
that
of
poets
and
of
kings
which
to
look
upon
filled
his
heart
with
worship
in
front
of
the
embankment
a
few
yards
out
into
the
stream
was
moored
a
string
of
barges
between
them
and
the
shore
the
reflected
made
one
unbroken
breadth
of
radiance
blackening
the
from
that
the
eye
rose
to
thomas
hospital
spreading
block
after
block
its
windows
telling
of
the
manifold
woe
within
nearer
was
the
archbishop
palace
dark
lifeless
the
roofs
were
defined
against
a
sky
made
lurid
by
the
streets
of
lambeth
on
the
pier
below
signalled
two
crimson
lights
the
church
bells
kept
up
their
clangorous
discord
softened
at
times
by
the
wind
a
steamboat
came
fretting
up
the
stream
when
it
had
passed
under
the
bridge
its
spreading
track
caught
the
reflected
gleams
and
flung
them
away
to
die
on
unsearchable
depths
then
issued
from
beneath
a
barge
with
set
sail
making
way
with
wind
and
tide
in
silence
it
moved
onwards
its
sail
dark
and
ghastly
till
the
further
bridge
swallowed
it
the
bells
ceased
gilbert
bent
his
head
and
listened
to
the
rush
of
the
water
voiceful
mysterious
sometimes
he
had
stood
there
and
wished
that
the
dread
tide
could
whelm
him
his
mood
was
far
other
now
some
power
he
did
not
understand
had
brought
him
here
as
to
the
place
where
he
could
best
realise
this
great
joy
that
had
befallen
him
but
the
wind
blew
piercingly
and
when
at
length
he
moved
from
the
parapet
he
found
that
his
arms
were
quite
numb
doubtless
he
had
stood
longer
than
he
thought
instead
of
returning
by
the
direct
way
he
walked
along
the
embankment
it
was
all
but
deserted
the
tread
of
a
policeman
echoed
from
the
distance
but
in
spite
of
the
bitter
sky
two
people
were
sitting
together
on
one
of
the
benches
a
young
man
and
a
they
were
speaking
scarcely
above
a
whisper
gilbert
averted
his
face
as
he
passed
them
and
for
the
moment
his
eyes
had
their
look
issuing
into
westminster
bridge
road
he
found
himself
once
more
amid
a
throng
and
before
he
had
gone
far
he
recognised
a
figure
that
walked
just
ahead
of
him
it
was
ackroyd
he
was
accompanied
by
a
girl
of
whom
gilbert
had
no
knowledge
miss
totty
nancarrow
they
were
talking
in
a
merry
careless
way
ackroyd
smoked
a
cigar
and
totty
walked
with
her
usual
independence
with
that
swaying
of
the
haunches
and
swing
of
the
hands
with
palm
turned
outwards
which
is
characteristic
of
the
london
her
laugh
now
and
then
rose
to
a
high
note
her
companion
threw
back
his
head
and
joined
in
the
mirth
clearly
ackroyd
was
in
a
way
to
recover
his
spirits
at
the
junction
of
two
ways
they
stopped
gilbert
stopped
too
for
he
did
not
care
to
pass
them
and
be
recognised
he
crossed
the
road
and
from
the
other
side
watched
them
as
they
stood
talking
now
they
were
taking
leave
of
each
other
ackroyd
appeared
to
hold
the
girl
hand
longer
than
she
liked
when
she
struggled
to
get
away
he
suddenly
bent
forward
and
snatched
a
kiss
with
a
gesture
of
indignation
she
escaped
from
him
gilbert
had
a
desire
to
join
ackroyd
now
that
the
latter
was
alone
but
as
he
began
to
recross
the
street
the
young
man
moved
on
and
turned
into
a
gilbert
again
stopped
and
disregarding
the
crowds
about
him
lost
himself
in
thought
he
determined
at
length
to
go
his
way
grail
had
supper
ready
with
some
mince
pies
of
her
own
making
lot
i
make
she
said
as
they
sat
down
say
to
myself
be
the
last
no
mother
we
shall
eat
a
good
many
together
yet
gilbert
replied
cheerily
the
wind
had
brought
a
touch
of
colour
to
his
cheeks
and
made
his
eyes
glisten
you
taken
any
upstairs
he
asked
presently
my
dear
do
you
think
i
may
i
should
think
so
the
old
lady
looked
at
him
and
grew
thoughtful
there
was
no
work
to
rise
to
on
the
morrow
with
a
clear
conscience
gilbert
could
sit
on
into
the
still
hours
which
were
so
precious
to
him
and
again
before
going
to
rest
he
stepped
quietly
from
the
house
to
look
at
the
upper
windows
chapter
x
tempting
fortune
thyrza
continued
to
be
far
from
well
the
darkness
encouraged
her
natural
tendency
to
sad
dreaming
when
alone
in
lydia
absence
at
the
she
sometimes
had
fits
of
weeping
it
was
a
relief
to
shed
tears
she
could
have
given
no
explanation
of
the
sufferings
which
found
this
outlet
her
heart
lay
under
a
cold
weight
that
was
all
she
knew
lydia
pursued
her
course
with
the
usual
method
and
contentment
yet
in
these
days
just
before
christmas
with
a
perceptible
falling
off
in
the
animation
which
was
the
note
of
her
character
perhaps
she
too
was
affected
by
the
weather
perhaps
she
was
anxious
about
thyrza
one
would
have
said
however
that
she
had
some
trouble
distinct
from
these
on
christmas
eve
she
ran
round
to
paradise
street
to
make
arrangements
for
the
next
day
evidently
it
would
not
be
wise
for
thyrza
to
leave
home
that
being
the
ease
it
was
decided
that
boddy
should
come
and
have
tea
with
the
girls
in
their
own
room
lydia
talked
over
these
things
with
mary
in
the
kitchen
below
the
shop
where
odours
of
christmas
fare
were
already
rife
the
parlour
was
full
of
noisy
people
amid
whom
bower
was
holding
weighty
discourse
the
friends
had
gone
below
for
privacy
i
shall
keep
the
coat
till
he
comes
lydia
said
know
thyrza
would
like
to
see
his
poor
old
face
when
he
puts
it
on
and
you
might
come
round
yourself
mary
just
for
an
hour
see
if
i
can
suppose
you
have
people
at
night
do
know
i
sure
i
much
rather
come
and
sit
with
you
but
mother
may
want
me
lydia
asked
ackroyd
been
here
lately
have
seen
him
i
hope
not
do
you
say
that
mary
asked
lydia
impatiently
only
say
what
i
think
dear
lydia
for
once
succeeded
in
choosing
wiser
silence
but
that
look
which
had
no
place
upon
her
fair
open
countenance
came
for
a
moment
a
passing
darkness
which
might
be
forecast
of
unhappy
things
at
four
on
the
following
afternoon
this
christmas
fell
on
a
friday
everything
was
ready
in
walnut
tree
walk
for
arrival
the
overcoat
purchased
by
lydia
after
a
vast
amount
of
comparing
and
selecting
of
deciding
and
rejecting
and
redeciding
was
carefully
hidden
to
be
produced
at
a
suitable
moment
the
bitter
coldness
of
the
day
gladdened
the
girls
now
that
they
knew
the
old
man
would
go
away
well
wrapped
up
this
coat
had
furnished
a
subject
for
many
an
hour
of
talk
between
them
and
now
as
they
waited
they
amused
themselves
with
anticipation
of
what
boddy
would
say
what
he
would
think
how
joyfully
he
would
throw
aside
that
one
overcoat
he
did
possess
a
garment
really
too
far
gone
and
with
no
pretence
of
warmth
in
it
thyrza
introduced
a
note
of
sadness
by
asking
happen
lyddy
if
he
gets
that
he
ca
earn
any
thing
sometimes
think
of
that
lydia
replied
gravely
could
expect
the
bowers
to
keep
him
there
if
he
could
pay
his
rent
but
i
always
hope
that
we
shall
be
able
to
find
what
he
needs
it
is
much
poor
grandad
and
you
see
we
can
always
manage
to
save
something
thyrza
it
would
be
enough
nothing
like
enough
for
a
room
and
meals
lyddy
we
shall
find
a
way
perhaps
she
laughed
shall
have
more
money
some
day
two
rings
at
the
bell
on
the
lower
landing
announced
their
arrival
lydia
ran
downstairs
and
returned
with
the
old
man
whose
face
was
very
red
from
the
raw
air
he
had
a
muffler
wrapped
about
his
neck
but
the
veteran
overcoat
was
left
behind
for
the
simple
reason
that
boddy
felt
he
looked
more
respectable
without
it
his
threadbare
black
suit
had
been
subjected
to
vigorous
brushing
with
a
little
exercise
of
the
needle
here
and
there
a
pair
of
woollen
gloves
long
kept
for
occasions
of
ceremony
were
the
most
substantial
article
of
clothing
that
he
wore
a
baize
bag
of
which
lydia
had
relieved
him
contained
his
violin
thought
you
maybe
like
a
little
music
my
dear
he
said
as
he
kissed
thyrza
cheerin
when
you
do
feel
quite
the
thing
i
doubt
you
ca
sing
though
the
cold
all
gone
replied
thyrza
see
after
tea
they
made
much
of
him
and
it
must
have
been
very
sweet
to
the
poor
old
fellow
to
be
so
affectionately
tended
by
these
whom
he
loved
as
his
own
children
mary
bower
came
not
long
after
tea
then
boddy
took
out
his
violin
from
the
bag
and
played
all
the
favourite
old
tunes
those
which
brought
back
their
childhood
to
the
two
girls
to
please
mary
lydia
asked
for
a
one
she
had
grown
fond
of
in
chapel
mary
began
to
sing
it
so
lydia
got
her
and
asked
thyrza
to
sing
with
them
the
air
was
a
sweet
one
and
thyrza
voice
gave
it
touching
beauty
as
she
sang
soft
and
low
other
hymns
followed
mary
bower
fell
into
her
gentler
mood
and
showed
how
pleasant
she
could
be
when
nothing
irritated
her
susceptibilities
the
hours
passed
quickly
to
nine
then
mary
said
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
you
want
to
stay
a
little
longer
boddy
she
said
will
you
go
home
with
me
rather
walk
home
in
good
company
than
alone
miss
mary
he
replied
call
it
walking
but
it
only
a
it
would
be
worse
if
you
could
walk
at
all
mary
said
my
dear
as
you
always
are
i
no
call
to
grumble
it
a
bad
habit
as
grows
on
me
i
fear
if
lyddy
only
tell
me
of
it
both
together
you
might
do
me
good
but
lyddy
treats
me
like
a
spoilt
child
it
her
old
way
shall
take
us
both
in
hand
said
lydia
shall
cure
me
of
my
sharp
temper
and
you
of
grumbling
grandad
and
i
know
which
be
the
hardest
job
laughing
with
kindly
mirth
the
old
man
drew
on
his
woollen
gloves
and
took
up
his
hat
and
the
then
he
offered
to
say
you
forgetting
your
grandad
said
lydia
did
come
in
it
my
dear
that
then
i
sure
do
wear
such
things
she
pointed
to
a
chair
on
which
thyrza
had
just
artfully
spread
the
gift
boddy
looked
in
a
puzzled
way
had
he
really
come
in
his
coat
and
forgotten
it
he
drew
nearer
no
coat
o
mine
lyddy
he
said
thyrza
broke
into
a
laugh
whose
is
it
then
she
exclaimed
play
tricks
grandad
put
it
on
at
once
come
come
you
keeping
mary
waiting
said
lydia
catching
up
the
coat
and
holding
it
ready
then
boddy
understood
he
looked
from
lydia
to
thyrza
with
dimmed
eyes
a
good
mind
never
to
speak
to
either
of
you
again
he
said
in
a
tremulous
voice
if
you
had
need
enough
of
your
money
lyddy
lyddy
and
you
as
bad
thyrza
a
woman
like
you
you
ought
to
teach
your
sister
better
why
there
it
no
good
i
do
know
what
to
say
to
you
now
what
do
you
think
of
this
mary
lydia
still
held
up
the
coat
and
at
length
persuaded
the
old
man
to
don
it
the
effect
upon
his
appearance
was
remarkable
conscious
of
it
he
held
himself
more
upright
and
stumped
to
the
little
square
of
to
try
and
regard
himself
here
he
furtively
brushed
a
hand
over
his
eyes
ready
mary
my
dear
i
ready
it
no
good
saying
anything
to
girls
like
these
lyddy
thyrza
may
you
have
a
many
happy
christmas
children
this
is
the
first
as
you
made
a
happy
one
for
me
lydia
went
down
to
the
door
and
watched
the
two
till
they
were
lost
in
darkness
then
she
returned
to
her
sister
with
a
sigh
of
gladness
for
the
moment
she
had
no
trouble
of
her
own
upon
days
of
festival
kept
in
howsoever
quiet
and
pure
a
spirit
there
of
necessity
follows
depression
all
mirth
is
unnatural
to
the
reflective
mind
and
even
the
unconscious
suffer
a
mysterious
penalty
when
they
have
wrested
one
whole
day
from
fate
on
the
saturday
lydia
had
no
work
to
go
to
and
the
hours
dragged
in
the
course
of
the
morning
she
went
out
to
make
some
purchases
she
was
passing
bower
without
intention
of
entering
when
mary
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
beckoned
her
bower
was
out
mary
had
been
left
in
charge
of
the
shop
were
asking
me
about
ackroyd
she
said
when
they
had
gone
into
the
parlour
you
like
to
know
something
i
heard
about
him
last
night
lydia
knew
that
it
was
something
disagreeable
mary
air
of
discharging
a
duty
sufficiently
proved
that
is
it
she
asked
coldly
were
talking
about
him
here
when
i
came
back
last
night
begun
to
go
about
with
that
girl
totty
nancarrow
lydia
cast
down
her
eyes
mary
keeping
silence
she
said
what
if
he
has
think
it
right
you
should
know
on
thyrza
account
has
nothing
to
do
with
ackroyd
you
know
that
mary
there
something
else
he
begun
to
drink
lydia
raggles
saw
him
in
a
somewhere
last
night
and
he
was
quite
tipsy
lydia
said
nothing
she
held
a
market
bag
before
her
and
her
white
knuckles
proved
how
tightly
she
clutched
the
handles
remember
what
i
once
said
mary
continued
there
was
absolutely
no
malice
in
her
tone
but
mere
satisfaction
in
proving
that
the
premises
whence
her
conclusions
had
been
drawn
were
undeniably
sound
she
was
actuated
neither
by
personal
dislike
of
ackroyd
nor
by
jealousy
but
she
could
not
resist
this
temptation
of
illustrating
her
principles
by
such
a
noteworthy
instance
was
i
right
lydia
lydia
looked
up
with
hot
cheeks
do
believe
it
she
said
vehemently
raggles
how
do
you
know
he
tells
the
truth
and
what
is
it
to
me
whether
it
true
or
not
were
so
sure
that
it
made
no
difference
what
any
one
believed
lydia
said
the
other
with
calm
persistency
i
say
the
same
still
and
i
always
will
say
it
you
when
anybody
speaks
against
ackroyd
and
you
believe
them
whatever
they
said
i
never
go
to
chapel
again
with
you
mary
as
long
as
i
live
you
unkind
and
it
your
that
makes
you
so
you
no
business
to
call
me
in
to
tell
me
things
of
this
kind
after
please
do
mention
ackroyd
name
you
know
nothing
at
all
about
him
without
waiting
for
a
reply
she
left
the
parlour
and
went
on
her
way
mary
was
rather
pale
but
she
felt
convinced
of
the
truth
of
what
she
had
reported
and
she
had
done
her
plain
duty
in
drawing
the
lesson
whether
lydia
would
acknowledge
that
seemed
doubtful
the
outburst
of
anger
confirmed
mary
in
strange
suspicions
which
had
for
some
time
lurked
in
her
mind
on
sunday
evening
lydia
dressed
as
if
to
go
to
chapel
and
left
the
house
at
the
usual
hour
she
had
heard
nothing
from
mary
bower
and
her
resentment
was
yet
warm
she
did
not
like
to
tell
thyrza
what
had
happened
but
went
out
to
spend
the
time
as
best
she
could
almost
as
soon
as
her
sister
was
gone
thyrza
paid
a
little
attention
to
her
dress
and
went
downstairs
she
knocked
at
the
grails
parlour
it
was
gilbert
voice
that
answered
grail
in
she
asked
timidly
looking
about
the
room
she
in
miss
trent
but
she
does
feel
very
well
she
went
to
lie
down
after
tea
i
sorry
she
hesitated
just
within
the
door
you
like
to
go
to
her
room
gilbert
asked
she
asleep
i
must
disturb
her
would
you
lend
me
another
book
mr
grail
yes
will
you
come
and
choose
one
she
closed
the
door
and
went
forward
to
the
bookcase
on
her
way
glancing
at
gilbert
face
to
see
whether
he
was
annoyed
at
her
disturbing
him
it
was
scarcely
that
yet
unmistakably
his
countenance
was
troubled
this
made
thyrza
nervous
she
did
not
look
at
him
again
for
a
few
moments
but
carried
her
eyes
along
the
shelves
poor
little
one
the
titles
were
no
help
to
her
gilbert
knew
that
well
enough
but
he
was
watching
her
by
stealth
and
forgot
to
speak
do
you
think
would
do
for
me
mr
grail
she
said
at
length
must
be
anything
very
hard
you
know
saying
that
she
met
his
eyes
there
was
a
smile
in
them
and
one
so
reassuring
so
she
knew
not
what
that
she
was
tempted
to
add
know
best
what
i
want
i
shall
trust
you
something
shook
the
man
from
head
to
foot
the
words
which
came
from
him
were
involuntary
he
heard
them
as
if
another
had
spoken
trust
me
you
believe
that
i
would
do
my
best
to
please
you
thyrza
felt
a
strangeness
in
his
words
but
replied
to
them
with
a
frank
smile
think
so
mr
grail
he
was
holding
his
hand
to
her
mechanically
she
gave
hers
but
in
the
doing
it
she
became
frightened
his
face
had
altered
it
was
as
if
he
suffered
a
horrible
pain
then
she
heard
you
trust
your
life
to
me
thyrza
it
was
like
a
flash
dazzling
her
brain
never
in
her
idlest
moment
had
she
strayed
into
a
thought
of
this
he
had
always
seemed
to
her
comparatively
an
old
man
and
his
gravity
would
in
itself
have
prevented
her
from
viewing
him
as
a
possible
suitor
he
seemed
so
buried
in
his
books
he
was
so
unlike
the
men
who
had
troubled
her
with
attentions
hitherto
yet
he
held
her
hand
and
surely
his
words
could
have
but
one
meaning
gilbert
saw
how
disconcerted
how
almost
shocked
she
was
did
mean
to
say
that
at
once
he
continued
hurriedly
releasing
her
hand
been
too
hasty
you
did
expect
that
it
is
fair
to
you
will
you
sit
down
he
still
spoke
without
guidance
of
his
tongue
he
was
impelled
by
a
vast
tenderness
the
startled
look
on
her
face
made
him
reproach
himself
he
sought
to
soothe
her
and
was
incoherent
awkward
as
if
in
implicit
obedience
she
moved
to
a
chair
he
stood
gazing
at
her
and
the
love
which
had
at
length
burst
from
the
dark
depths
seized
upon
all
his
being
grail
she
began
but
her
voice
failed
she
looked
at
him
and
he
was
smitten
to
the
heart
to
see
that
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
it
gives
you
pain
he
said
in
a
low
voice
drawing
near
to
her
that
i
said
anything
i
would
for
my
life
make
you
feel
unhappy
thyrza
smiled
through
her
tears
she
saw
how
gentle
his
expression
had
become
his
voice
touched
her
the
reverence
which
she
had
always
felt
for
him
grew
warmer
under
his
gaze
till
it
was
almost
the
affection
of
a
child
for
a
father
should
i
be
the
right
kind
of
wife
for
you
mr
grail
she
asked
with
a
strange
simplicity
and
diffidence
know
so
little
you
think
of
being
my
wife
he
said
in
tones
that
shook
with
restrained
emotion
am
so
much
older
than
you
but
you
are
the
first
for
whom
i
have
ever
felt
love
and
here
he
tried
to
smile
is
very
sure
that
i
shall
love
you
as
long
as
i
live
her
breast
heaved
she
held
out
both
her
hands
to
him
and
said
quickly
i
will
marry
you
grail
i
will
try
my
best
to
be
a
good
wife
to
you
he
stood
as
if
doubting
both
her
hands
were
together
in
his
he
searched
her
blue
eyes
and
their
depths
rendered
to
him
a
sweetness
and
purity
before
which
his
heart
bowed
in
worship
then
he
leaned
forward
and
kissed
her
forehead
thyrza
reddened
and
kept
her
eyes
down
i
go
now
she
said
when
after
kissing
her
hands
he
had
released
them
at
the
first
feeling
that
they
were
being
drawn
away
you
wish
to
thyrza
stay
if
you
like
grail
but
i
think
she
had
risen
the
warmth
would
not
pass
from
her
cheeks
and
the
sensation
prevented
her
from
looking
up
she
desired
to
escape
and
be
alone
you
come
down
and
speak
to
mother
in
the
morning
gilbert
said
relieving
her
from
the
necessity
of
adding
more
will
have
something
to
tell
you
i
come
mr
grail
both
had
forgotten
the
book
that
was
to
have
been
selected
thyrza
gave
her
hand
as
she
always
did
when
taking
leave
of
him
save
that
she
could
not
meet
his
eyes
he
held
it
a
little
longer
than
usual
then
saw
her
turn
and
leave
the
room
hurriedly
an
hour
later
when
grail
came
into
the
parlour
gilbert
drew
from
its
envelope
and
handed
to
her
the
letter
he
had
received
from
egremont
on
christmas
eve
she
read
it
and
turned
round
to
him
with
astonishment
did
you
tell
me
this
child
well
now
if
i
did
there
was
something
that
night
have
you
answered
oh
no
you
not
to
answer
for
a
week
your
advice
how
that
reminds
me
of
your
father
the
old
lady
exclaimed
heard
him
speak
just
with
that
voice
and
that
look
many
a
time
well
well
my
dear
it
only
waiting
you
see
something
comes
soon
or
late
to
those
that
deserve
it
i
glad
i
lived
to
see
this
gilbert
he
said
when
they
had
talked
of
it
for
a
few
minutes
you
show
this
to
thyrza
morning
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
over
the
top
of
her
spectacles
keenly
be
sure
i
will
yes
yes
of
course
i
will
been
here
for
a
few
minutes
since
tea
i
told
her
if
she
come
down
in
the
morning
you
have
something
to
tell
her
been
here
but
why
did
you
call
me
i
must
go
up
and
speak
mother
it
was
better
that
you
were
here
i
had
something
to
say
to
her
something
i
wanted
to
say
before
she
heard
of
this
now
she
has
a
right
to
know
lydia
returned
shortly
after
eight
she
had
walked
about
aimlessly
for
an
hour
and
a
half
avoiding
the
places
where
she
was
likely
to
meet
anyone
she
knew
she
was
chilled
and
wretched
thyrza
said
nothing
till
her
sister
had
taken
off
her
hat
and
jacket
and
seated
herself
did
you
see
ackroyd
last
she
inquired
sure
i
do
know
was
the
reply
passed
him
in
the
walk
about
a
week
ago
i
mean
when
did
you
speak
to
him
not
for
a
long
time
said
lydia
smoothing
the
hair
upon
her
forehead
seems
to
have
forgotten
all
about
me
lyddy
the
other
looked
down
into
the
speaker
face
with
eyes
that
were
almost
startled
do
you
say
that
dear
you
think
he
has
may
have
done
replied
lydia
averting
her
eyes
do
know
you
said
you
wanted
him
to
thyrza
i
did
in
that
way
but
i
asked
him
to
be
friends
with
us
i
do
see
why
he
should
keep
away
from
us
altogether
it
only
what
you
had
to
expect
said
lydia
rather
coldly
in
a
moment
however
she
had
altered
her
voice
to
add
could
be
friends
with
us
in
the
way
you
mean
dear
have
you
been
thinking
about
him
she
showed
some
anxiety
said
thyrza
often
think
about
him
but
not
because
i
sorry
for
what
i
did
i
shall
never
be
sorry
for
that
shall
i
tell
you
why
it
something
you
never
guess
if
you
tried
all
night
you
could
no
more
guess
it
than
you
could
i
do
know
what
lydia
looked
inquiringly
your
arm
round
me
and
have
a
nice
face
as
soon
as
you
gone
to
chapel
i
thought
i
go
down
and
ask
grail
to
lend
me
a
book
i
went
and
knocked
at
the
door
and
grail
was
there
alone
and
he
asked
me
to
come
and
choose
a
book
and
we
began
to
talk
and
lyddy
he
asked
me
if
i
be
his
wife
lydia
astonishment
was
for
the
instant
little
less
than
that
which
had
fallen
upon
thyrza
when
she
felt
her
hand
in
grail
her
larger
experience
however
speedily
brought
her
to
the
right
point
of
view
in
less
time
than
it
would
have
taken
her
to
express
surprise
her
wits
had
arranged
a
number
of
little
incidents
which
remained
in
her
memory
and
had
reviewed
them
all
in
the
light
of
this
disclosure
this
was
the
meaning
of
grail
reticence
of
his
apparent
coldness
at
times
surely
she
was
very
dull
never
to
have
surmised
it
yet
he
was
so
much
older
than
thyrza
he
was
so
confirmed
a
student
no
she
had
never
suspected
this
feeling
all
this
in
a
flash
of
consciousness
whilst
she
pressed
her
sister
closer
to
her
side
then
what
did
you
say
dear
said
i
would
lyddy
the
elder
sister
became
very
grave
she
bit
first
her
lower
then
her
upper
lip
said
that
at
once
thyrza
i
felt
i
must
felt
you
must
thyrza
could
but
inadequately
explain
what
she
meant
by
this
the
words
involved
a
truth
but
one
of
which
she
had
no
conscious
perception
gilbert
grail
was
a
man
of
strong
personality
and
in
no
previous
moment
of
life
had
his
being
so
uttered
itself
in
look
and
word
as
when
involuntarily
he
revealed
his
love
more
the
vehemence
of
his
feeling
went
forth
in
that
subtle
influence
with
which
forcible
natures
are
able
to
affect
now
an
individual
now
a
crowd
thyrza
was
very
susceptible
of
such
impression
the
love
which
had
become
in
gilbert
heart
sensibly
moved
her
own
ackroyd
had
had
no
power
to
touch
her
so
his
ardour
had
never
appealed
to
her
imagination
with
such
constraining
reality
grail
was
the
first
to
make
her
conscious
of
the
meaning
of
passion
it
was
not
passion
which
rose
within
her
to
reply
to
his
but
the
childlike
security
in
which
she
had
hitherto
lived
was
at
an
end
love
was
henceforth
to
be
the
preoccupation
of
her
soul
she
answered
her
sister
could
refuse
him
he
said
he
should
love
me
as
long
as
he
lived
and
i
felt
that
it
was
true
he
did
try
to
persuade
me
lyddy
when
i
showed
how
surprised
i
was
he
spoke
very
kindly
and
wanted
me
to
have
time
to
think
dearest
you
say
you
were
surprised
you
had
thought
of
such
a
thing
i
sure
i
had
how
could
you
say
yes
at
once
have
i
done
wrong
lyddy
lydia
was
again
busy
with
conjecture
in
woman
way
rapidly
reading
secrets
by
help
of
memory
and
intuition
she
connected
this
event
with
what
mary
bower
had
reported
to
her
of
ackroyd
if
it
were
indeed
true
that
ackroyd
no
longer
made
pretence
of
loyalty
to
his
old
love
would
not
grail
knowledge
of
that
change
account
for
his
sudden
abandonment
of
disguise
the
two
were
friends
grail
might
well
have
shrunk
from
entering
into
rivalry
with
the
younger
man
she
felt
a
convincing
clearness
in
this
then
it
was
true
that
ackroyd
had
begun
to
show
an
interest
in
totty
nancarrow
it
was
true
she
added
bitterly
connecting
it
closely
with
the
other
fact
that
he
haunted
something
of
that
habit
she
had
heard
formerly
but
thought
of
it
as
long
abandoned
how
would
he
hear
of
thyrza
having
pledged
herself
assuredly
he
had
not
forgotten
her
she
knew
him
he
could
not
forget
so
lightly
it
was
thyrza
disregard
that
had
driven
him
into
folly
her
sister
was
repeating
the
question
why
could
you
feel
in
the
same
way
to
to
the
other
thyrza
burst
from
lydia
loved
you
and
he
still
loves
you
why
did
you
try
to
feel
for
him
you
do
love
mr
grail
thyrza
drew
a
little
apart
feel
i
shall
be
glad
to
be
his
wife
she
said
firmly
felt
i
must
say
yes
and
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
be
sorry
i
could
never
have
said
yes
to
ackroyd
lyddy
she
sprang
forward
and
held
her
sister
again
know
why
i
could
you
ca
keep
secrets
from
me
though
you
could
from
any
one
else
you
know
why
i
could
never
have
wished
to
marry
him
they
held
each
other
in
that
unity
of
perfect
love
which
had
hallowed
so
many
moments
of
their
lives
lydia
face
was
hidden
but
at
length
she
raised
it
to
ask
solemnly
was
not
because
you
thought
this
that
you
promised
mr
grail
no
no
nobody
ever
love
me
but
you
and
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
have
a
sad
minute
if
i
see
that
you
happy
i
do
hope
done
right
sure
i
have
lyddy
you
must
tell
mary
and
grandad
think
how
surprised
they
be
of
course
everybody
know
soon
i
shall
go
to
work
you
know
i
quite
well
again
and
lyddy
when
i
grail
of
course
ackroyd
come
and
see
us
lydia
made
no
reply
to
this
she
could
not
tell
what
had
happened
between
herself
and
mary
bower
and
the
mention
of
ackroyd
name
was
now
a
distress
to
her
she
moved
from
her
seat
saying
that
it
was
long
past
thyrza
went
down
to
see
grail
next
morning
just
before
setting
out
for
work
the
piece
of
news
was
communicated
to
her
and
she
hastened
with
it
to
her
sister
but
gilbert
had
requested
that
they
would
as
yet
speak
of
it
to
no
one
it
was
better
to
wait
till
egremont
had
himself
made
the
fact
known
among
the
members
of
his
class
lydia
was
much
impressed
with
gilbert
behaviour
in
keeping
that
good
fortune
a
secret
in
the
interview
with
thyrza
it
heightened
her
already
high
opinion
of
him
and
encouraged
her
to
look
forward
with
hope
yet
hope
would
not
come
without
much
bidding
doubts
and
anxieties
knocked
only
too
freely
at
her
heart
one
evening
lydia
returning
from
making
a
purchase
for
grail
met
ackroyd
it
was
at
the
kennington
road
end
of
walnut
tree
walk
he
seemed
to
be
waiting
he
raised
his
hat
lydia
bent
her
head
and
walked
past
but
a
quick
step
sounded
behind
her
trent
will
you
stop
a
minute
she
turned
luke
held
out
his
hand
a
long
time
since
we
spoke
a
word
he
said
with
friendliness
we
not
always
going
to
pass
each
other
like
that
are
we
lydia
smiled
it
was
all
she
could
do
she
did
not
know
for
certain
that
he
had
yet
heard
the
news
want
you
he
continued
give
your
sister
my
good
wishes
will
you
i
will
mr
ackroyd
came
and
told
me
all
about
it
it
was
pleasant
to
hear
but
he
a
good
fellow
and
i
not
surprised
at
his
luck
i
have
felt
i
wanted
to
quarrel
with
him
and
i
think
better
of
myself
for
that
and
yet
it
means
a
good
deal
to
me
more
than
you
think
i
dare
say
soon
forget
it
ackroyd
lydia
said
in
a
clear
steady
voice
you
see
if
i
do
i
one
of
the
unlucky
fellows
that
can
never
show
what
they
feel
it
all
comes
out
in
the
wrong
way
it
does
matter
much
now
lydia
had
a
feeling
that
this
was
not
wholly
sincere
he
seemed
to
take
a
pleasure
in
representing
himself
as
luckless
combined
with
what
she
had
heard
it
helped
her
to
say
man
does
suffer
much
from
these
things
you
soon
be
cheerful
again
mr
ackroyd
she
did
not
wait
for
anything
more
from
him
chapter
xi
a
man
with
a
future
dalmaine
first
turned
his
attention
to
politics
at
the
time
when
the
question
of
popular
education
was
to
the
front
in
british
politics
it
was
an
excellent
opportunity
for
legislators
conscious
of
rhetorical
gifts
and
only
waiting
for
some
safe
simple
subject
whereon
to
exercise
them
both
safe
and
simple
was
the
topic
which
all
and
sundry
were
then
called
upon
to
discuss
it
was
impossible
not
to
have
views
on
education
have
we
not
all
been
educated
and
delightfully
easy
to
support
them
by
prophecy
never
had
the
vaticinating
style
of
oratory
a
greater
vogue
never
was
a
richer
occasion
for
the
utterance
of
wisdom
such
as
recommends
itself
to
the
british
public
dalmaine
understood
the
tastes
and
habits
of
that
public
as
well
as
most
men
of
his
standing
after
one
abortive
attempt
to
enter
parliament
he
gained
his
seat
for
vauxhall
at
the
election
of
and
from
the
day
of
his
success
he
steadily
applied
himself
to
the
political
profession
he
was
then
for
twelve
years
he
had
been
actively
engaged
in
commerce
and
now
held
the
position
of
senior
partner
in
a
firm
owning
several
factories
in
lambeth
such
a
training
was
valuable
politics
he
viewed
as
business
on
a
larger
scale
and
business
the
larger
its
scale
the
better
was
his
one
enthusiasm
his
education
had
not
been
liberal
he
saw
that
that
made
no
difference
and
wisely
pursued
the
bent
of
his
positive
mind
where
another
man
might
have
wasted
his
time
in
the
attempt
to
gain
culture
he
saw
that
his
was
the
age
of
the
practical
let
who
would
be
an
idealist
the
practical
man
in
the
end
got
all
that
was
worth
having
he
worked
you
might
have
seen
him
for
instance
in
his
study
one
sunday
morning
in
the
january
which
the
story
has
now
reached
a
glance
at
him
showed
that
he
was
no
idler
in
fields
of
art
or
erudition
were
heaped
about
him
hooks
bound
in
law
calf
lay
open
near
his
hand
newspapers
monopolised
one
table
he
was
interested
in
all
that
concerns
the
industrial
population
of
great
britain
he
was
making
that
subject
his
speciality
he
meant
to
link
his
name
with
factory
acts
with
education
acts
with
acts
for
the
better
housing
of
the
with
what
not
of
the
kind
and
the
single
working
man
for
whom
he
veritably
cared
one
jot
was
james
dalmaine
he
was
rather
a
fellow
a
sound
englishman
his
ears
were
not
quite
so
close
against
his
head
as
they
should
be
his
lips
might
have
had
a
more
urbane
expression
his
hand
might
have
been
a
trifle
less
weighty
but
when
he
stood
up
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
looked
musingly
along
the
cornice
of
the
room
one
felt
that
his
appearance
on
a
platform
would
conciliate
those
electors
who
desire
that
parliament
should
represent
the
comely
british
breed
he
was
fairly
though
some
held
that
he
had
speculated
a
little
rashly
of
late
he
felt
very
strongly
however
that
his
pedestal
must
be
yet
more
solid
before
he
could
claim
the
confidence
of
his
countrymen
with
the
completeness
that
he
desired
of
late
he
had
given
thought
to
a
particular
scheme
and
not
at
all
a
disagreeable
one
for
enhancing
his
social
and
therefore
political
credit
he
was
thinking
of
her
the
scheme
i
would
say
at
present
these
chambers
of
his
were
in
westminster
they
were
spacious
convenient
he
had
received
deputations
from
his
constituents
here
lambeth
was
only
just
over
the
water
he
liked
to
be
near
for
it
was
one
of
his
hobbies
one
of
the
very
few
that
he
allowed
himself
to
keep
thoroughly
cognisant
of
the
affairs
of
his
borough
which
as
you
are
aware
includes
the
district
of
lambeth
even
of
its
petty
affairs
some
day
he
said
to
himself
he
would
in
this
way
overlook
great
britain
would
have
her
statistics
at
his
would
change
here
confirm
there
guide
everywhere
in
the
meantime
he
satisfied
himself
with
this
section
he
knew
what
was
going
on
in
clubs
in
places
of
amusement
in
the
market
streets
there
is
a
pleasure
in
surveying
from
a
height
the
doing
and
driving
of
ordinary
mortals
a
member
for
vauxhall
studying
his
borough
in
this
spirit
naturally
comes
to
feel
himself
a
sort
of
grand
duke
it
was
one
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
followed
by
the
appearance
of
a
man
who
silently
proclaimed
himself
a
secretary
this
was
tasker
he
had
served
dalmaine
thus
for
three
years
prior
to
which
he
had
been
employed
as
a
clerk
at
the
works
in
lambeth
dalmaine
first
had
his
attention
drawn
to
tasker
eight
or
nine
years
before
by
an
instance
of
singular
shrewdness
in
the
latter
discharge
of
his
duties
from
that
day
he
kept
his
eye
on
him
took
opportunities
of
advancing
him
tasker
was
born
with
a
love
of
politics
and
with
a
genius
for
detail
dalmaine
discovered
all
this
and
when
the
due
season
came
raised
him
to
the
dignity
of
his
private
scribe
tasker
regarded
his
employer
as
his
earthly
providence
was
devoted
to
him
served
him
admirably
it
was
the
one
instance
of
dalmaine
having
interested
himself
in
an
individual
he
had
no
thought
of
anything
but
his
own
profit
in
doing
so
but
none
the
less
he
had
made
a
mortal
happy
you
observe
the
beneficence
that
lies
in
practicality
before
going
to
luncheon
on
a
sunday
it
was
dalmaine
practice
to
talk
of
things
in
general
with
his
secretary
among
other
questions
he
asked
with
a
meaning
smile
of
young
egremont
lectures
has
he
recommenced
first
of
the
new
course
is
replied
tasker
who
sat
bending
a
over
his
leg
dalmaine
knowing
his
secretary
encouraged
him
to
be
on
easy
terms
in
truth
he
had
a
liking
for
tasker
partly
it
reciprocated
the
other
feeling
no
doubt
and
then
one
generally
looks
with
indulgence
on
a
man
whom
one
has
discovered
and
developed
he
go
on
with
his
literature
the
title
is
thoughts
for
the
present
dalmaine
leaned
back
and
laughed
it
was
a
hearty
laugh
foresaw
it
i
foresaw
it
and
how
many
hearers
has
he
only
be
sure
there
is
something
more
egremont
is
going
to
present
lambeth
with
a
free
public
library
he
has
taken
a
building
fact
how
do
you
know
that
tasker
heard
it
at
the
club
last
night
he
has
informed
the
members
of
his
class
he
is
really
going
to
bleed
himself
to
prove
his
sincerity
they
discussed
the
subject
a
little
longer
then
dalmaine
dictated
a
letter
or
two
that
he
wished
to
have
off
his
mind
and
after
that
bade
tasker
at
four
in
the
afternoon
he
drove
up
to
a
house
at
lancaster
gate
where
he
had
recently
been
a
not
infrequent
visitor
the
servant
preceded
him
with
becoming
stateliness
to
the
and
announced
his
name
in
the
hearing
of
three
ladies
who
were
pleasantly
chatting
in
the
aroma
of
tea
the
eldest
of
them
was
tyrrell
her
companions
were
miss
tyrrell
and
a
young
married
lady
paying
a
call
tyrrell
was
one
of
those
excellently
preserved
matrons
who
testify
to
the
wholesome
placidity
of
woman
life
in
wealthy
english
homes
her
existence
had
taken
for
granted
the
perfection
of
the
universe
probably
she
had
never
thought
of
a
problem
which
did
not
solve
itself
for
the
pleasant
trouble
of
stating
it
in
refined
terms
and
certainly
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
social
propriety
was
distinguishable
from
the
absolute
good
she
was
not
a
dull
woman
and
the
opposite
of
an
unfeeling
one
but
her
wits
and
her
heart
had
both
been
so
subdued
to
the
social
code
that
it
was
very
difficult
for
her
to
entertain
seriously
any
mode
of
thought
or
action
for
which
she
could
not
recall
a
respectable
precedent
by
nature
she
was
indulgent
of
mild
disposition
of
sunny
intelligence
so
endowed
circumstances
had
bidden
her
regard
it
as
the
end
of
her
being
to
respect
conventions
to
check
her
native
impulse
if
ever
it
went
counter
to
the
opinion
of
society
to
use
her
intellect
for
the
sole
purpose
of
discovering
how
far
it
was
permitted
to
be
used
and
she
was
a
happy
woman
had
always
been
a
happy
woman
she
had
known
a
little
trouble
in
relation
to
her
favourite
sister
marriage
with
newthorpe
for
she
foresaw
that
it
could
not
turn
out
very
well
and
she
had
been
obliged
to
censure
her
sister
for
excessive
devotion
to
the
pleasures
of
society
it
grieved
her
on
the
other
hand
to
think
of
her
poor
niece
being
brought
up
in
a
way
so
utterly
opposed
to
all
the
traditions
but
these
were
only
little
ripples
on
the
smooth
flowing
surface
you
knew
that
she
would
never
be
smitten
down
with
a
great
sorrow
she
was
of
those
whom
fate
must
needs
respect
so
gracefully
and
sweetly
do
they
accept
happiness
as
their
right
dalmaine
joined
these
ladies
with
the
manner
of
the
sturdy
briton
who
would
make
himself
agreeable
yet
dreads
the
his
voice
would
have
been
better
if
a
little
more
subdued
he
seated
himself
with
perhaps
rather
more
of
ease
than
of
grace
but
on
the
whole
society
would
have
let
him
pass
muster
as
a
man
are
interested
in
all
that
concerns
your
constituency
dalmaine
said
tyrrell
were
speaking
of
egremont
plan
of
founding
a
library
in
lambeth
you
have
heard
of
it
yes
you
think
it
will
be
a
good
thing
am
very
doubtful
one
does
like
to
speak
unkindly
of
such
admirable
intentions
but
i
really
think
that
in
this
he
is
working
on
a
wrong
principle
i
so
strongly
object
to
anything
when
in
the
power
of
people
to
win
it
for
themselves
with
a
little
wholesome
exertion
now
there
the
free
library
act
if
the
people
of
lambeth
really
want
a
library
let
them
tax
themselves
and
adopt
the
statutory
scheme
sincerely
i
believe
that
egremont
will
do
more
harm
than
good
we
must
avoid
anything
that
tends
to
pauperise
the
working
classes
amusing
exclaimed
paula
almost
word
for
word
what
just
been
saying
paula
was
dressed
in
the
prettiest
of
she
looked
the
most
exquisite
of
conservatory
flowers
her
smile
to
dalmaine
was
very
gracious
really
is
how
i
felt
said
tyrrell
egremont
will
never
be
persuaded
of
that
he
is
so
wholehearted
in
his
desire
to
help
these
poor
people
yet
i
afraid
so
very
very
unpractical
the
young
married
lady
observed
no
one
ought
to
interfere
with
philanthropy
unless
they
have
a
practical
scheme
canon
brougham
was
so
emphatic
on
that
point
this
morning
so
harm
may
be
done
when
we
mean
everything
for
the
best
i
feel
that
very
strongly
said
dalmaine
his
masculine
accent
more
masculine
than
ever
after
the
plaintive
piping
even
fear
that
egremont
is
doing
wrong
in
making
his
lectures
free
we
may
be
sure
they
are
well
worth
paying
to
hear
and
it
an
axiom
in
all
dealing
with
the
working
class
that
they
will
never
value
anything
that
they
do
pay
for
but
dalmaine
protested
paula
could
ask
egremont
to
take
money
at
the
door
sounds
shocking
miss
tyrrell
but
if
egremont
stands
before
them
as
a
teacher
he
ought
to
charge
for
his
lessons
i
assure
you
they
would
put
a
far
higher
value
on
his
lectures
i
grieve
to
hear
that
his
class
has
fallen
off
i
could
have
foreseen
that
the
basis
is
not
sound
to
put
it
in
plain
even
coarse
language
all
social
reform
must
be
undertaken
on
strictly
commercial
principles
i
should
like
to
hear
you
say
that
to
mr
egremont
remarked
paula
his
face
egremont
is
an
idealist
said
tyrrell
smiling
the
very
kind
of
person
to
attempt
social
reform
exclaimed
the
young
married
lady
the
conversation
drew
off
into
other
channels
dalmaine
was
supplied
with
the
clearest
opinions
on
every
topic
and
he
had
a
way
of
delivering
them
which
was
most
effective
with
persons
of
composition
in
everything
he
affected
sobriety
if
he
had
to
express
a
severe
judgment
it
was
done
with
gentlemanly
regret
if
he
commended
anything
he
did
so
with
a
judicial
air
in
fact
it
would
not
have
been
easy
to
imagine
dalmaine
speaking
with
an
outburst
of
natural
fervour
on
any
topic
whatsoever
his
view
was
the
view
of
common
sense
and
he
enunciated
the
barrenest
convictions
in
a
tone
which
would
have
suited
profound
originality
a
week
later
there
was
a
dinner
party
at
the
tyrrells
and
egremont
was
among
the
bidden
he
had
persisted
in
his
tendency
to
hold
aloof
from
general
society
in
spite
of
many
warnings
from
ormonde
but
he
could
not
short
of
ingratitude
wholly
absent
himself
from
his
friends
at
lancaster
gate
tyrrell
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
in
her
attitude
to
egremont
as
did
all
matronly
ladies
she
held
him
in
very
warm
liking
and
sincerely
hoped
that
a
young
man
so
admirably
fitted
for
the
refinements
of
social
life
would
in
time
get
rid
of
his
extravagant
idealism
a
little
of
that
was
graceful
society
was
beginning
to
view
it
with
favour
when
confined
within
the
proper
bounds
but
to
carry
it
into
act
and
waste
one
life
in
wholly
unpractical
nay
in
positively
harmful
enterprise
was
a
sad
thing
she
had
reasoned
with
him
but
he
showed
himself
so
perverted
in
his
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
that
the
task
had
to
be
abandoned
as
hopeless
and
yet
the
good
lady
liked
him
she
had
hoped
and
not
so
long
ago
that
he
might
some
day
desire
to
stand
in
a
nearer
relation
to
her
than
that
of
a
friend
but
herein
again
she
felt
that
her
wish
was
growing
futile
paula
indulged
in
hints
with
reference
to
her
cousin
annabel
and
tyrrell
began
to
fear
that
the
strangely
educated
girl
might
be
the
cause
of
walter
extreme
aberrations
egremont
arrived
early
on
the
evening
of
the
dinner
only
one
guest
had
preceded
him
with
tyrrell
and
paula
were
tyrrell
and
the
son
of
the
house
john
the
jack
tyrrell
of
sundry
convivial
clubs
in
town
tyrrell
senior
was
a
jovial
gentleman
of
three
score
great
in
finance
practical
to
the
backbone
yet
with
wit
and
tact
which
put
him
at
ease
with
all
manner
of
men
even
with
social
reformers
these
latter
amused
him
vastly
he
failed
to
see
that
the
world
needed
any
reforming
whatever
at
all
events
beyond
that
which
is
constitutionally
provided
for
in
the
proceedings
of
the
british
parliament
he
had
great
wealth
he
fared
sumptuously
every
day
things
shone
to
him
in
a
rosy
light
not
a
gross
or
a
selfish
man
for
he
was
as
as
he
was
contented
and
gave
very
freely
of
his
substance
it
was
simply
his
part
in
the
world
to
enjoy
the
product
of
other
men
labour
and
to
set
an
example
of
glorious
egremont
in
certain
moods
had
tried
to
despise
tyrrell
but
he
never
quite
succeeded
nor
indeed
was
the
man
contemptible
had
you
told
him
with
frank
conviction
that
you
deemed
him
a
poor
sort
of
phenomenon
he
would
have
shaken
the
ceiling
with
laughter
and
have
admired
you
for
your
for
there
was
a
large
and
generous
vigour
about
him
and
adverse
criticism
could
only
heighten
his
satisfaction
in
his
own
stability
something
of
the
cold
dignity
in
which
she
had
taken
refuge
at
ullswater
was
still
to
be
remarked
in
paula
manner
as
she
received
egremont
she
held
her
charming
head
erect
and
let
her
eyelids
droop
a
little
and
the
few
words
which
she
addressed
to
him
were
rather
absently
spoken
with
others
as
they
arrived
she
was
sportively
intimate
her
bearing
had
gained
a
little
in
maturity
during
the
past
half
year
but
it
was
still
with
a
blending
of
and
capricious
affectation
that
she
wrought
her
spell
her
dress
was
a
miracle
and
inseparably
a
part
of
her
it
was
impossible
to
picture
her
in
any
serious
situation
so
entirely
was
she
a
child
of
luxury
and
frivolous
concern
exquisite
as
an
artistic
product
of
society
she
affected
the
imagination
not
so
much
by
her
personal
charm
as
through
the
perfume
of
luxury
which
breathed
about
her
egremont
with
his
radical
tendencies
of
thought
found
himself
marvelling
as
he
regarded
her
what
a
life
was
hers
compare
it
with
that
of
some
little
in
lambeth
such
as
he
saw
in
the
street
what
spaces
between
those
two
worlds
was
it
possible
that
this
dainty
creation
this
thing
of
material
omnipotence
would
suffer
decay
of
her
sweetness
and
in
the
end
die
the
reason
took
her
side
and
revolted
against
law
it
would
be
an
outrage
if
time
or
mischance
laid
hold
upon
her
yet
there
was
something
in
paula
which
he
did
not
recognise
since
she
could
formulate
desires
few
had
found
impression
on
her
lips
which
were
not
at
once
gratified
an
exception
caused
her
at
first
rather
astonishment
than
impatience
such
astonishment
fell
upon
her
when
she
understood
that
egremont
coming
to
ullswater
was
not
on
her
account
in
truth
she
wished
it
had
been
and
from
that
moment
the
fates
were
kind
enough
to
notice
paula
poor
little
existence
and
bid
her
remember
she
was
mortal
she
took
the
admonition
ill
and
certainly
it
was
impertinent
from
her
point
of
view
she
had
slight
philosophy
but
out
of
that
disappointment
paula
by
degrees
drew
an
understanding
that
she
had
had
a
glimpse
of
a
strange
world
that
something
of
moment
had
been
at
stake
egremont
standing
in
the
rear
of
a
chatting
group
had
all
but
dreamed
himself
into
oblivion
of
the
present
when
he
heard
loud
announcement
of
dalmaine
it
was
some
time
since
he
had
met
the
member
for
vauxhall
looking
upon
the
politician
frame
his
face
with
its
expression
of
shrewd
earnestness
he
for
a
moment
seemed
to
himself
to
shrink
into
insignificance
after
sitting
opposite
dalmaine
for
an
hour
at
the
he
was
able
to
regard
the
man
again
in
what
he
deemed
a
true
light
but
the
impression
made
upon
one
by
an
object
suddenly
presented
when
the
thought
is
busy
with
far
other
things
will
as
a
rule
embody
much
essential
truth
as
a
force
egremont
would
not
have
weighed
in
the
scale
against
dalmaine
putting
himself
in
conscious
opposition
to
such
a
man
he
had
but
his
due
in
a
sense
of
nullity
tyrrell
was
kind
to
him
in
the
assignment
of
a
partner
a
pretty
gentle
receptive
maiden
anxious
to
show
interest
in
things
of
the
mind
with
such
a
one
walter
was
at
his
best
because
his
simplest
and
happiest
he
put
away
thought
of
lambeth
which
in
truth
was
beginning
to
trouble
his
mind
like
a
fixed
idea
and
talked
much
as
he
would
have
done
a
couple
of
years
ago
with
bright
intelligence
with
natural
enjoyment
of
the
hour
it
was
greatly
his
charm
in
such
conversation
that
had
made
him
a
favourite
with
pleasant
people
of
the
world
in
withdrawing
himself
from
the
sphere
of
these
amenities
he
was
opposing
the
free
growth
of
his
character
which
in
consequence
suffered
he
was
cognisant
of
that
he
knew
that
he
was
more
himself
than
he
had
been
for
some
months
but
the
fixed
idea
waited
in
the
background
when
the
ladies
were
gone
he
saw
dalmaine
rise
and
come
round
the
table
towards
him
glad
to
see
you
again
dalmaine
began
depositing
his
and
refilling
it
tell
me
something
about
your
lectures
you
have
resumed
since
christmas
i
think
egremont
had
no
mind
to
speak
of
these
things
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
find
an
answer
i
still
have
a
few
hearers
and
at
once
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
falling
into
this
confession
of
failure
dalmaine
was
the
last
man
before
whom
he
would
affect
humility
am
sure
observed
the
politician
who
has
the
good
of
the
working
classes
at
heart
must
feel
indebted
to
you
it
so
very
seldom
that
men
of
culture
care
to
address
audiences
of
that
kind
yet
it
must
be
the
most
effectual
way
of
reaching
the
people
you
address
them
on
english
literature
i
think
egremont
did
not
care
to
explain
that
he
had
now
a
broader
subject
he
murmured
an
affirmative
dalmaine
had
hoped
to
elicit
some
of
the
for
the
present
and
felt
disappointment
excellent
choice
it
seems
to
me
he
continued
making
his
glass
revolve
on
the
are
much
too
ignorant
of
the
best
wealth
of
their
country
they
have
so
few
inducements
to
read
the
great
historians
for
instance
if
you
can
bring
them
to
do
so
you
make
them
more
capable
citizens
abler
to
form
a
judgment
on
the
questions
of
the
day
egremont
smiled
one
aim
he
remarked
to
persuade
them
to
forget
that
there
are
such
things
as
questions
of
the
day
dalmaine
also
smiled
and
with
a
slight
involuntary
curling
of
the
lip
i
remember
our
discussions
on
the
atlantic
i
scarcely
thought
you
would
apply
those
ideas
in
their
their
fulness
when
you
began
practical
work
you
surely
will
admit
that
in
a
time
when
their
interests
are
engaging
so
much
attention
working
men
should
for
instance
go
to
the
polls
with
intelligent
preparation
rather
they
did
go
to
the
polls
at
all
walter
replied
he
knew
that
this
was
exaggeration
but
it
pleased
him
to
exaggerate
he
enjoyed
the
effect
on
the
honourable
member
broad
countenance
come
said
dalmaine
laughing
with
appearance
of
entering
into
the
joke
that
rate
english
freedom
would
soon
be
at
an
end
one
might
as
well
abolish
newspapers
my
opinion
the
one
greatest
boon
that
could
be
granted
the
working
class
i
do
my
best
to
dissuade
them
from
the
reading
of
newspapers
dalmaine
turned
the
whole
matter
into
a
jest
secretly
he
believed
that
egremont
was
poking
contemptuous
fun
at
him
but
it
was
his
principle
to
receive
everything
with
they
drew
apart
again
each
feeling
more
strongly
than
ever
the
instinctive
opposition
between
their
elements
it
amounted
to
a
reciprocal
dislike
an
irritation
provoked
by
each
other
presence
dalmaine
was
beginning
to
suspect
egremont
of
some
scheme
too
deep
for
his
fathoming
it
was
easier
for
him
to
believe
anything
than
that
idealism
pure
and
simple
was
at
the
bottom
of
such
behaviour
walter
on
the
other
hand
viewed
the
politician
personality
with
something
more
than
contempt
dalmaine
embodied
those
forces
of
philistinism
that
essence
of
the
vulgar
creed
which
egremont
had
undertaken
to
attack
and
which
as
he
already
felt
were
likely
to
yield
as
little
before
his
efforts
as
a
stone
wall
under
the
blow
of
a
naked
hand
two
such
would
do
well
to
keep
apart
on
returning
to
the
egremont
kept
watch
for
a
vacant
place
by
paula
presently
he
was
able
to
move
to
her
side
she
spread
her
fan
upon
her
lap
and
ruffling
its
edge
of
white
fur
said
negligently
you
decided
to
waste
an
evening
mr
egremont
decided
to
have
an
evening
of
rest
and
enjoyment
suppose
you
are
working
dreadfully
hard
when
do
you
open
your
library
in
less
than
four
or
five
months
will
you
stand
at
the
counter
and
give
out
books
like
the
young
men
at
mudie
i
dare
say
but
i
have
found
a
librarian
is
he
working
man
in
lambeth
one
of
the
most
sympathetic
natures
i
have
ever
met
a
man
who
might
have
gone
on
all
his
life
making
candles
that
is
how
things
are
arranged
candles
what
a
funny
change
of
occupation
and
you
really
think
you
are
doing
good
in
that
disagreeable
place
can
only
hope
are
quite
sure
you
are
not
doing
harm
it
seem
to
you
that
i
am
paula
assumed
an
air
of
wisdom
course
i
have
no
right
to
speak
of
such
things
but
it
is
my
opinion
that
you
are
destroying
their
sense
of
i
think
they
ought
to
have
things
them
they
should
be
encouraged
to
help
themselves
he
examined
her
face
it
was
obvious
that
this
profound
sentiment
had
not
taken
birth
in
paula
charming
little
head
and
he
guessed
from
whom
she
had
derived
it
have
no
doubt
dalmaine
would
agree
with
you
he
said
smiling
believe
i
have
heard
him
say
something
of
the
kind
glad
to
hear
it
dalmaine
is
an
authority
in
such
matters
i
the
very
reverse
of
one
i
really
do
think
egremont
that
you
are
taking
up
things
for
which
you
are
not
not
exactly
suited
you
know
she
said
it
with
the
prettiest
air
of
patronage
looking
at
him
for
a
moment
then
as
usual
letting
her
eyes
wander
about
the
room
tyrrell
he
replied
with
gravity
that
was
half
genuine
me
for
what
i
exactly
suited
and
you
will
do
me
a
vast
kindness
she
reflected
there
are
lots
of
things
you
do
very
nicely
indeed
i
seen
you
play
croquet
beautifully
but
i
always
thought
it
a
pity
you
a
clergyman
walter
laughed
a
local
preacher
is
next
to
it
both
were
at
once
carried
back
to
the
evening
at
ullswater
paula
kept
silence
her
eyes
were
directed
towards
dalmaine
who
almost
at
the
same
moment
looked
towards
her
she
played
with
her
fan
know
that
my
uncle
has
been
ill
she
said
i
have
heard
nothing
of
that
paula
looked
surprised
you
hear
from
from
them
have
a
letter
from
newthorpe
very
occasionally
but
surely
the
illness
has
not
been
serious
heard
this
morning
about
it
i
do
know
what
been
the
matter
i
should
wonder
if
they
come
to
london
before
long
egremont
shortly
changed
his
place
and
saw
that
dalmaine
took
the
vacant
seat
by
paula
the
two
seemed
to
get
on
very
well
together
paula
was
evidently
exerting
herself
to
be
charming
dalmaine
was
doing
his
best
to
trifle
he
sought
more
information
from
tyrrell
regarding
newthorpe
she
seemed
to
fear
that
her
might
have
been
in
more
danger
than
annabel
in
her
letter
admitted
certainly
must
come
south
she
said
are
having
a
terrible
winter
and
it
has
evidently
tried
newthorpe
beyond
his
strength
you
have
influence
with
him
i
believe
egremont
pray
join
me
in
my
efforts
to
bring
them
both
back
to
civilisation
fear
my
influence
will
effect
nothing
if
yours
fails
said
walter
newthorpe
should
certainly
not
risk
his
health
he
next
had
a
chat
with
john
tyrrell
junior
paula
brother
was
a
frankly
sensual
youth
of
admirable
temper
great
in
turf
matters
with
a
genius
for
conviviality
jack
health
was
perfect
for
he
had
his
father
habit
of
enjoying
life
without
excess
and
his
stamina
allowed
a
wide
limit
to
the
term
moderation
like
the
rest
of
his
family
he
had
the
secret
of
conciliating
goodwill
there
was
no
humbug
in
him
and
one
respected
him
as
a
fine
specimen
of
the
young
male
developed
at
enormous
expense
for
egremont
he
had
a
certain
reverence
a
man
who
habitually
thought
was
clearly
he
admitted
of
a
higher
grade
than
himself
and
he
had
no
objection
whatever
to
proclaim
his
own
inferiority
egremont
talking
with
him
was
half
disposed
to
envy
jack
tyrrell
what
a
simple
thing
life
was
with
limitless
cash
a
perfect
digestion
and
in
the
place
of
brains
his
room
seemed
very
cold
and
lonely
when
he
got
back
to
it
shortly
before
midnight
the
fire
had
been
let
out
the
books
round
the
walls
had
a
musty
appearance
there
was
stale
tobacco
in
the
air
he
paced
the
floor
thinking
of
annabel
wondering
whether
she
would
soon
be
in
london
longing
to
see
her
and
before
he
went
to
bed
he
wrote
a
letter
to
newthorpe
expressing
the
anxiety
with
which
he
had
heard
of
his
illness
of
himself
he
said
little
the
few
words
that
came
to
his
pen
concerning
the
lambeth
crusade
were
rather
lifeless
he
was
being
talked
of
meanwhile
in
the
tyrrells
the
last
guests
being
gone
there
was
chat
for
a
few
minutes
between
the
members
of
the
family
is
looking
quite
up
to
the
mark
said
tyrrell
as
he
stood
before
the
fire
hands
in
pockets
thought
the
same
said
his
wife
seems
worried
what
a
deplorable
thing
it
is
to
think
that
he
will
spend
large
sums
of
money
on
this
library
scheme
tyrrell
made
inarticulate
noises
and
at
length
laughed
must
amuse
himself
in
his
own
way
after
all
papa
said
paula
whose
advocacy
went
much
by
the
rule
of
contraries
must
be
a
good
thing
to
give
people
books
to
read
i
dare
say
it
prevents
them
from
going
to
the
wonder
if
it
does
paula
he
replied
with
a
benevolent
gaze
what
your
objection
do
object
to
the
library
in
particular
it
only
that
egremont
is
the
man
to
do
these
kind
of
things
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
get
tired
of
it
and
find
something
more
in
his
line
his
line
that
the
question
very
likely
he
has
one
at
all
it
seems
to
me
there
a
good
many
young
fellows
in
that
case
nowadays
they
have
education
they
have
money
and
they
do
know
what
the
deuce
to
do
with
either
one
or
the
other
they
a
cut
above
you
jack
it
is
enough
for
them
to
live
and
enjoy
themselves
so
they
get
it
into
their
heads
that
they
called
upon
to
reform
the
world
a
nice
handy
little
job
that
keep
them
going
the
girls
i
notice
are
beginning
to
have
the
same
craze
i
should
wonder
if
paula
gets
an
idea
that
she
be
a
or
go
in
bethnal
green
certainly
should
if
i
thought
it
would
amuse
me
said
paula
why
should
egremont
do
work
of
this
kind
he
in
earnest
he
does
only
do
it
for
fun
course
he
in
earnest
and
there
the
absurdity
of
it
social
reform
pooh
why
who
are
the
real
social
reformers
the
men
who
care
a
scrap
for
the
people
but
take
up
ideas
because
they
can
make
capital
out
of
them
it
is
idealists
who
do
the
work
of
the
world
but
the
practical
selfish
men
a
big
employer
of
labour
do
more
good
in
a
day
just
because
he
sees
profit
come
of
it
than
all
the
mooning
philanthropists
in
a
hundred
years
nothing
solid
has
ever
been
gained
in
this
world
that
was
pursued
out
of
look
at
dalmaine
how
much
do
you
think
he
cares
for
the
he
always
talking
about
but
he
do
them
many
a
good
turn
he
make
many
a
life
easier
and
just
because
it
his
business
to
do
so
because
it
the
way
of
advancing
himself
he
aims
at
being
home
secretary
one
of
these
days
and
i
should
wonder
if
he
is
there
your
real
social
reformer
egremont
an
amateur
a
dilettante
in
many
ways
he
worth
a
hundred
of
dalmaine
but
dalmaine
will
benefit
the
world
and
it
well
if
egremont
does
do
harm
in
all
which
it
is
not
impossible
that
john
tyrrell
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
much
satisfied
with
his
little
oration
he
went
off
to
don
a
jacket
and
enjoy
a
cigar
by
his
fire
a
couple
of
days
later
dalmaine
called
at
the
house
before
luncheon
after
speaking
with
tyrrell
he
had
a
private
interview
with
paula
the
event
was
referred
to
in
a
letter
paula
addressed
to
her
cousin
annabel
in
the
course
of
the
ensuing
week
bell
we
are
much
relieved
by
your
letter
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
stay
among
those
mountains
for
the
rest
of
the
winter
i
hope
uncle
will
very
soon
be
well
enough
to
come
south
the
plan
of
living
at
eastbourne
for
a
time
is
no
doubt
a
good
one
you
have
ormonde
to
talk
to
she
is
very
nice
though
i
generally
found
her
a
little
serious
but
then
she
like
you
in
that
i
think
it
a
pity
people
trouble
themselves
about
things
that
only
make
them
gloomy
have
a
little
piece
of
news
for
you
it
really
looks
as
if
i
was
going
to
be
married
in
fact
i
said
i
would
be
and
i
think
it
likely
i
shall
keep
my
word
my
name
will
be
dalmaine
do
you
remember
egremont
speaking
of
dalmaine
and
calling
him
names
from
that
moment
i
made
up
my
mind
that
he
must
be
a
very
nice
man
and
when
we
made
his
acquaintance
i
found
that
i
was
so
far
wrong
you
see
poor
egremont
so
hates
everything
and
everybody
practical
now
i
practical
as
you
know
so
it
right
i
should
marry
a
practical
man
papa
has
the
highest
opinion
of
abilities
he
thinks
he
has
a
great
future
in
politics
would
it
be
delightful
if
one
husband
really
became
prime
minister
or
something
of
the
kind
you
know
it
really
a
pity
that
egremont
is
going
on
in
this
way
he
going
to
spend
enormous
sums
of
money
in
establishing
a
library
in
lambeth
it
very
good
of
him
of
course
but
we
are
all
so
sure
it
a
mistake
shall
i
tell
you
view
egremont
is
an
idealist
and
idealists
are
the
people
to
do
serious
work
of
this
kind
the
real
social
reformers
are
the
practical
men
who
at
heart
care
only
for
their
own
advancement
if
you
think
i
sure
you
find
this
is
true
you
see
that
i
am
beginning
to
occupy
myself
with
serious
questions
it
will
be
necessary
in
the
wife
of
an
active
politician
but
if
you
hint
to
egremont
that
he
is
going
shockingly
astray
he
dined
with
us
the
other
night
and
does
look
at
all
well
i
am
so
afraid
lest
he
is

lights
and
shadows
egremont
face
it
was
true
showed
that
things
were
not
altogether
well
with
him
it
was
not
but
mental
restlessness
which
expressed
itself
in
the
lines
of
his
forehead
and
the
diminished
brightness
of
his
eyes
during
the
last
two
months
of
the
year
he
had
felt
a
constant
need
of
help
and
help
such
as
would
alone
stead
him
he
could
not
find
it
was
no
mere
failing
of
purpose
he
prepared
his
lectures
as
thoroughly
as
ever
and
delivered
them
with
no
less
zeal
than
in
the
first
weeks
indeed
if
anything
his
energy
grew
for
since
his
nearer
acquaintance
with
gilbert
grail
the
latter
face
before
him
was
always
an
incentive
there
was
much
to
discourage
him
more
than
half
his
class
fell
from
lukewarmness
to
patent
indifference
they
would
probably
present
themselves
until
the
end
of
the
course
but
it
was
little
likely
that
they
would
recommence
with
him
after
christmas
he
was
obliged
to
recognise
the
utter
absence
of
idealism
from
all
save
grail
unless
bunce
might
be
credited
with
glimmerings
of
the
true
light
yet
intellectually
he
held
himself
on
firm
ground
to
have
discovered
one
man
such
as
grail
was
compensation
for
failure
with
many
others
and
the
project
of
the
library
was
at
all
times
a
vista
of
hope
but
egremont
was
not
of
those
who
can
live
on
altruism
his
life
of
loneliness
irked
him
irked
him
as
never
yet
the
dawn
was
a
recurrence
of
weariness
the
long
nights
were
cold
and
blank
the
old
unrest
which
he
had
believed
at
an
end
when
once
task
of
his
life
was
discovered
troubled
him
through
many
a
day
had
he
been
free
it
would
have
driven
him
on
new
travels
yet
that
was
no
longer
a
real
resource
he
did
not
desire
to
see
other
lands
but
to
make
a
home
in
his
own
and
no
home
was
promised
him
the
longer
he
kept
apart
from
annabel
the
dimmer
did
the
vision
of
her
become
he
held
it
a
sign
that
he
himself
was
seldom
if
ever
in
her
mind
did
he
still
love
her
rather
he
would
have
said
that
there
lay
in
him
great
faculty
of
love
which
annabel
if
she
willed
it
could
at
a
moment
bring
into
life
she
he
believed
in
preference
to
any
woman
he
had
known
it
was
not
passion
and
the
consciousness
that
it
was
not
often
depressed
him
one
of
his
ideals
was
that
of
a
passion
nurtured
to
be
the
crowning
glory
of
life
he
did
not
love
annabel
in
that
way
would
that
he
could
have
done
this
purely
personal
distress
could
not
but
affect
his
work
a
month
before
the
end
of
the
year
he
came
to
the
resolve
to
choose
a
new
subject
for
the
succeeding
course
of
lectures
forgetting
all
the
sound
arguments
by
which
he
had
been
led
to
prefer
the
simple
teaching
of
a
straightforward
subject
to
any
more
ambitious
prophecy
he
was
now
impelled
to
think
out
a
series
of
discourses
on
well
on
things
in
general
he
got
hold
of
the
title
for
the
present
and
the
temptation
to
make
use
of
it
proved
too
great
english
literature
did
not
hold
the
average
proletarian
mind
it
had
served
him
to
make
an
acquaintance
with
a
little
group
of
men
now
he
must
address
them
in
a
bolder
way
reveal
to
them
his
personality
had
he
not
always
contemplated
such
revelation
in
the
end
yes
when
he
found
his
class
fit
for
it
but
he
was
growing
impatient
with
this
slow
progress
if
indeed
it
could
be
called
progress
at
all
he
would
strike
a
more
significant
note
walter
was
in
danger
as
you
very
well
understand
there
is
no
need
at
this
time
of
day
to
remind
ourselves
of
teachers
who
have
fallen
into
the
fatal
springe
of
apostolicism
men
would
so
fain
be
prophets
when
once
they
have
a
fellow
mortal
by
the
ear
egremont
could
have
exposed
this
risk
to
you
as
well
as
any
yet
he
deliberately
ignored
it
in
his
own
case
no
great
novelty
that
i
not
something
veritably
to
say
are
not
thoughts
of
and
for
the
present
surging
in
my
mind
whereto
have
we
language
if
not
for
the
purpose
of
uttering
the
soul
within
us
so
he
fell
to
work
on
his
introductory
lecture
and
for
a
few
days
had
peace
nay
lived
in
enthusiasm
once
more
his
week
of
absence
at
christmas
of
which
we
have
heard
was
spent
again
in
jersey
to
the
roaring
music
of
the
channel
breakers
he
built
up
his
towers
and
battlements
of
prophecy
more
he
wrote
a
poem
and
for
a
day
wondered
whether
it
might
be
well
to
read
it
to
his
audience
as
preface
a
friendly
sprite
whispered
in
his
ear
and
saved
him
from
too
utter
folly
the
sprite
had
not
yet
forsaken
him
woe
to
him
if
ever
it
should
he
wrapped
the
poem
in
a
letter
to
newthorpe
and
had
a
very
pleasant
reply
written
as
he
afterwards
heard
only
a
day
or
two
before
newthorpe
fell
annabel
sent
her
message
verses
were
noble
and
pure
as
the
on
returning
to
town
he
sent
a
note
to
grail
asking
him
to
come
in
the
evening
to
great
russell
street
or
if
that
were
inconvenient
to
appoint
a
time
for
a
meeting
in
walnut
tree
walk
gilbert
accepted
the
invitation
and
came
for
the
first
time
to
egremont
rooms
things
were
not
ill
with
him
gilbert
grail
you
saw
in
the
visage
that
he
had
put
off
ten
years
of
haggard
life
his
dark
deep
eyes
spoke
their
meanings
with
the
ardour
of
soul
joy
his
cheeks
seemed
to
have
filled
out
his
brows
to
have
smoothed
it
was
joy
of
the
purest
and
manliest
his
life
had
sailed
like
some
battered
vessel
into
a
fair
harbour
of
sunlight
and
blue
and
hands
were
busy
giving
to
it
a
brave
new
aspect
he
could
scarce
think
of
all
his
happiness
at
once
the
coming
release
from
a
hateful
drudgery
and
the
coming
day
which
would
put
thyrza
hand
in
his
would
not
go
into
one
perspective
sometimes
he
would
all
but
forget
the
one
in
thinking
of
the
other
now
let
the
early
mornings
be
dark
and
chill
as
they
would
let
the
sky
lower
in
its
muddy
gloom
let
weariness
of
the
flesh
do
its
worst
those
two
days
were
approaching
why
was
he
not
yet
young
what
are
years
behind
one
when
bliss
unutterable
beckons
forward
it
should
all
be
forgotten
that
grimy
past
poisoned
through
and
through
with
the
stench
of
candles
books
books
and
time
to
use
them
and
a
hearth
about
which
love
is
busy
what
more
can
you
offer
son
of
man
than
these
he
had
written
his
acceptance
had
endeavoured
to
write
his
thanks
the
words
were
ineffectual
egremont
received
him
in
his
study
with
gladness
this
man
had
impressed
him
powerfully
was
winning
an
ever
larger
place
in
his
affection
he
welcomed
him
as
he
would
have
done
an
old
friend
for
whose
coming
he
had
looked
with
impatience
you
smoke
he
asked
no
gilbert
did
not
smoke
the
money
he
formerly
spent
on
this
had
long
been
saved
for
the
purchase
of
books
egremont
coffee
had
to
suffice
to
make
cheer
it
was
a
little
time
before
grail
could
speak
freely
he
had
suffered
from
nervousness
in
undertaking
this
visit
and
his
relief
at
the
simplicity
of
egremont
rooms
by
allowing
him
to
think
of
what
he
wished
to
say
caused
him
to
seem
absent
already
begun
to
jot
down
lists
of
obvious
books
egremont
said
have
a
good
general
catalogue
here
and
i
mean
to
go
through
it
carefully
gilbert
was
at
length
able
to
speak
his
thought
ought
to
have
said
far
more
than
i
did
in
my
letter
egremont
i
tried
to
thank
you
but
i
felt
i
might
as
well
have
left
it
alone
i
do
know
whether
you
have
any
idea
what
this
change
will
mean
to
me
it
more
than
saving
my
life
it
giving
me
a
new
one
such
as
i
never
dared
to
hope
for
right
glad
to
hear
it
walter
replied
with
his
kindest
look
comes
to
make
up
to
me
for
some
little
disappointment
in
other
things
i
afraid
the
lectures
have
been
of
very
slight
use
do
think
that
i
do
think
any
of
the
class
forget
them
it
likely
they
have
their
best
effect
in
a
little
time
the
men
think
back
upon
them
now
bunce
has
got
much
out
of
them
i
believe
bunce
yes
i
hoped
something
from
him
he
is
rather
a
violent
enemy
of
christianity
i
think
heard
so
i
do
know
him
myself
except
for
meeting
him
at
the
lectures
yes
i
heard
he
sometimes
almost
mad
about
religious
subjects
egremont
told
the
story
about
bunce
child
which
he
had
had
from
ormonde
and
this
led
him
on
to
speak
of
his
purpose
in
this
new
course
of
lectures
after
describing
his
plan
that
matter
of
religion
is
one
i
wish
to
speak
of
most
earnestly
i
think
i
can
put
forward
a
few
ideas
which
will
help
a
man
like
bunce
he
wants
to
be
made
to
see
the
attitude
of
a
man
who
retains
no
dogma
and
yet
is
far
more
a
friend
than
an
enemy
of
christianity
i
think
that
lecture
shall
come
first
he
had
not
yet
made
ready
his
syllabus
as
before
he
meant
to
send
it
to
those
whose
names
were
upon
his
list
his
first
evening
would
be
at
the
beginning
of
february
shall
try
with
ackroyd
again
he
said
the
subject
this
time
will
seem
more
attractive
to
him
gilbert
looked
grave
anxious
about
ackroyd
he
replied
had
private
trouble
lately
and
i
begin
to
be
afraid
it
driving
him
into
the
wrong
road
he
is
one
that
can
easily
be
persuaded
i
wish
you
might
succeed
in
bringing
him
to
the
lectures
egremont
tried
to
speak
hopefully
but
in
secret
he
felt
that
his
power
over
men
was
not
that
which
draws
them
from
the
way
of
evil
and
turns
them
to
light
for
that
is
needed
more
than
love
of
the
beautiful
for
a
moment
he
mused
in
misgiving
over
his
for
the
present
they
began
to
talk
of
those
details
in
the
library
scheme
which
egremont
had
left
for
subsequent
discussion
soon
as
the
premises
are
in
my
hands
he
said
shall
have
the
house
thoroughly
repaired
i
should
like
you
to
see
then
if
any
alteration
can
be
made
which
would
add
to
your
comfort
as
soon
as
the
place
can
be
made
ready
it
will
be
yours
to
take
possession
of
that
should
be
certainly
by
the
end
of
april
shall
you
be
free
to
leave
your
present
occupation
then
can
at
any
time
but
i
am
glad
to
have
a
date
fixed
i
going
to
be
married
then
it
was
said
with
a
curious
diffidence
which
brought
a
smile
to
the
hearer
face
egremont
was
surprised
at
the
intelligence
glad
at
the
same
time
is
good
news
he
said
course
i
had
thought
of
you
living
with
your
mother
this
will
be
better
still
your
future
wife
must
of
course
examine
the
house
no
doubt
she
be
a
far
better
judge
than
you
of
what
needs
doing
when
you
are
back
from
your
honeymoon
we
shall
go
to
work
together
on
arranging
books
that
be
a
rare
time
we
shall
throw
up
our
arms
like
dominie
sampson
and
cry
prodigious
he
grew
mirthful
indulging
the
boyish
humour
which
as
a
reaction
from
his
accustomed
lonely
silence
came
upon
him
when
he
had
a
sympathetic
companion
to
gilbert
this
was
a
new
phase
of
egremont
character
he
sober
in
happiness
answered
the
young
man
merriment
with
an
expressive
smile
grail
had
merely
mentioned
the
fact
of
his
intended
marriage
when
he
was
alone
egremont
wondered
much
within
himself
what
kind
of
woman
such
a
man
might
have
chosen
to
share
his
life
had
he
contemplated
marriage
for
some
time
and
been
prevented
from
it
by
stress
of
circumstances
it
was
not
easy
to
picture
the
suitable
partner
for
grail
clearly
she
must
be
another
than
the
thriftless
shiftless
creature
too
common
in
homes
yet
it
was
not
likely
that
he
had
met
with
any
one
who
could
share
his
inner
life
had
he
following
the
example
of
many
a
prudent
man
chosen
a
good
quiet
modest
woman
whose
first
and
last
anxiety
would
be
to
keep
his
home
in
order
and
see
that
he
lacked
no
comfort
within
her
province
to
bestow
it
was
probable
she
would
no
doubt
be
past
youth
suppose
her
thirty
she
would
have
a
face
which
pleased
by
its
homely
goodness
she
would
speak
in
a
gentle
voice
waiting
upon
superior
wisdom
a
few
days
before
that
appointed
for
the
first
lecture
of
this
new
course
egremont
received
a
letter
of
which
the
address
surprised
him
it
bore
the
penrith
the
writing
must
be
annabel
he
had
very
recently
written
to
newthorpe
who
was
not
yet
well
enough
to
attempt
the
journey
southwards
this
reply
by
another
hand
might
signify
ill
news
and
that
proved
to
be
the
case
annabel
wrote
egremont
father
desires
me
to
answer
your
very
kind
letter
of
a
week
ago
he
has
delayed
hoping
from
day
to
day
to
be
able
to
write
himself
i
grieve
to
say
that
he
is
suffering
more
than
at
any
time
in
the
last
month
i
am
very
anxious
full
of
trouble
tyrrell
wishes
to
come
to
me
and
i
am
writing
by
this
post
to
say
that
i
shall
be
very
glad
of
her
presence
our
doctors
say
there
is
absolutely
no
ground
for
fear
and
gladly
i
give
them
my
faith
but
it
tortures
me
to
see
my
dear
father
so
overcome
with
pain
the
world
seems
to
me
very
dark
and
life
a
dreadful
penalty
read
with
the
greatest
interest
of
what
you
are
doing
and
hoping
i
can
not
tell
you
how
we
rejoiced
in
the
happiness
of
grail
that
is
a
glorious
thing
that
you
have
done
i
trust
his
marriage
may
be
a
very
happy
one
when
we
are
at
eastbourne
and
father
is
well
again
we
must
come
to
see
your
library
and
no
less
your
librarian
do
not
be
discouraged
if
your
lectures
seem
to
fail
of
immediate
results
surely
good
work
will
have
fruit
and
very
likely
in
ways
of
which
you
will
never
know
tyrrells
will
have
constant
news
of
father
and
i
am
sure
will
gladly
send
it
on
to
i
am
dear
egremont
yours
sincerely
newthorpe
it
was
the
first
letter
he
had
received
from
annabel
for
some
days
he
kept
it
close
at
hand
and
looked
over
it
frequently
then
it
was
laid
away
with
care
not
again
to
be
read
until
the
passing
of
years
had
given
it
both
a
sadder
and
a
dearer
significance
chapter
xiii
thyrza
sings
again
egremont
had
a
fear
that
he
might
seem
ungrateful
to
the
man
bower
it
was
bower
to
whom
he
had
gone
for
help
when
he
first
sought
to
gather
an
audience
and
on
the
whole
the
help
had
been
effectual
yet
bower
had
not
borne
the
test
of
nearer
acquaintance
egremont
soon
knew
the
vulgarity
of
his
nature
and
had
much
difficulty
in
sustaining
the
show
of
friendly
intercourse
with
him
one
evening
in
he
called
the
portly
man
to
speak
with
him
after
lecture
and
with
what
geniality
he
could
explained
to
him
the
details
of
his
library
project
and
told
whom
he
had
chosen
for
librarian
bower
professed
himself
highly
satisfied
with
everything
and
as
usual
affected
egremont
disagreeably
with
his
subservience
the
latter
was
not
surprised
to
find
that
grail
had
kept
silence
on
the
subject
but
it
was
time
now
for
the
arrangements
to
be
made
public
from
the
bower
went
to
a
club
where
he
was
wont
to
relax
himself
of
evenings
here
he
discussed
the
library
question
with
such
acquaintances
as
were
at
hand
he
reached
home
just
after
the
closing
of
the
shop
mary
was
gone
to
bed
bower
had
just
finished
her
supper
and
was
musing
over
the
second
half
of
her
accustomed
pint
of
ale
her
husband
threw
himself
into
a
chair
with
an
exclamation
of
scornful
disgust
wrong
now
asked
bower
i
do
know
what
call
it
but
call
it
the
damnedest
bit
of
sneaking
behaviour
as
i
ever
knew
he
given
the
librarianship
to
that
fellow
grail
there
the
at
the
back
for
him
to
live
in
and
rent
free
no
doubt
and
there
a
good
lumping
salary
you
may
go
bail
now
what
do
you
think
o
that
job
him
not
as
much
as
offerin
it
to
you
so
much
as
offerin
it
how
many
he
have
got
to
hear
his
lectures
without
me
i
like
to
know
i
should
have
taken
it
no
of
course
i
should
it
would
a
suited
me
to
take
a
librarianship
but
it
was
his
bounden
duty
to
give
me
the
first
offer
i
never
thought
he
make
one
of
librarian
if
it
had
been
some
stranger
i
should
have
made
so
much
of
it
but
to
give
it
to
grail
in
that
sneaking
underhanded
way
why
i
be
ashamed
o
myself
a
rare
good
mind
never
to
go
near
his
lectures
again
better
go
said
bower
prudently
might
pay
you
out
at
the
works
it
be
a
trick
just
like
him
after
this
think
about
it
returned
the
other
with
dignity
sitting
upright
and
gathering
his
broad
beard
into
his
hand
there
now
cried
his
wife
struck
with
a
sudden
thought
that
does
explain
something
depend
upon
it
upon
it
that
how
grail
got
thyrza
trent
to
engage
herself
to
him
a
known
it
for
some
time
grail
will
a
done
he
a
mean
fellow
or
he
never
a
gone
and
set
her
against
ackroyd
as
it
easy
to
see
he
did
he
a
told
her
about
the
and
the
salary
of
course
he
will
if
i
did
think
there
was
something
queer
in
that
job
bower
saw
at
once
how
highly
probable
this
was
that
is
why
they
put
on
such
hairs
her
an
lydia
bower
pursued
all
very
well
for
mary
to
pretend
as
there
nothing
altered
it
my
belief
mary
got
to
know
more
than
she
tell
and
lydia
quarrelled
with
her
about
it
it
easy
enough
to
see
as
they
fell
out
lydia
ai
been
to
chapel
since
christmas
an
you
know
yourself
it
was
just
before
christmas
as
egremont
went
to
the
to
see
grail
if
she
been
a
bit
sharper
she
never
told
mary
that
i
ai
surprised
at
thyrza
doin
of
things
i
never
liked
her
but
i
thought
better
of
lydia
not
quarrelled
with
said
bower
magnanimously
girls
must
look
out
for
themselves
and
do
the
best
for
themselves
they
can
but
that
sneaking
hegremont
you
should
a
seen
him
when
he
had
the
cheek
to
tell
me
about
it
you
a
thought
he
was
going
to
give
me
a
note
you
see
said
bower
take
off
old
boddy
to
live
with
them
much
the
better
he
ca
earn
his
living
much
longer
and
who
was
to
pay
us
for
his
lodging
and
keep
i
like
to
know
thus
did
the
worthy
pair
link
together
conjectural
cause
and
effect
on
principles
which
their
habit
of
mind
dictated
on
one
point
bower
was
right
mary
and
lydia
had
not
come
together
since
the
former
triumph
over
her
friend
lydia
still
visited
the
shop
to
see
boddy
but
generally
at
the
times
when
mary
was
away
at
there
was
no
sign
that
she
suffered
at
all
the
good
lyddy
the
trouble
of
those
days
before
christmas
was
lost
in
the
anticipation
of
the
great
change
that
was
soon
to
come
upon
her
sister
life
to
that
she
had
resolved
to
look
forward
cheerfully
the
better
she
came
to
know
gilbert
the
warmer
grew
her
affection
for
him
they
were
made
to
be
friends
in
both
were
the
same
absolute
honesty
of
character
the
same
silent
depths
of
tenderness
the
same
stern
brother
and
sister
henceforth
with
the
bond
of
a
common
love
which
time
whether
it
brought
joy
or
sorrow
could
but
knit
closer
from
the
first
there
was
of
course
an
understanding
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
as
soon
as
the
house
was
ready
for
gilbert
tenancy
thyrza
went
secretly
and
examined
the
dwelling
from
the
outside
more
than
once
that
lydia
would
come
and
live
there
went
without
saying
she
pretended
to
oppose
this
plan
at
first
said
she
must
be
independent
well
said
thyrza
crossing
her
hands
on
her
lap
i
be
married
at
all
lyddy
and
grail
had
better
be
told
at
once
there
was
laughing
and
there
were
kind
words
do
think
you
ought
still
to
call
him
grail
said
lydia
i
shall
have
to
say
it
to
myself
for
a
few
days
still
a
nice
name
is
it
yes
that
point
needed
no
discussion
where
thyrza
abode
there
abode
lydia
until
but
sadness
lay
that
way
grail
was
equally
clear
as
to
the
arrangements
concerning
herself
she
would
keep
two
rooms
and
continue
to
live
in
walnut
tree
walk
thyrza
thought
this
would
be
unkindness
to
the
old
lady
but
grail
had
a
store
of
wisdom
and
was
resolute
in
practice
she
said
she
would
not
at
all
feel
the
loneliness
she
could
often
be
at
the
house
and
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
her
son
in
the
midlands
would
be
glad
to
send
one
of
his
two
girls
to
live
with
her
for
say
half
a
year
at
a
time
gilbert
understood
the
good
sense
of
this
disposition
the
weather
continued
doleful
until
at
length
in
the
last
week
of
february
there
came
a
sudden
change
a
rioting
east
wind
fell
upon
the
murky
vapours
of
the
lower
sky
broke
up
the
league
of
rain
and
darkness
and
through
one
day
drove
silver
fleece
over
deeps
of
clear
cold
blue
the
streets
were
swept
of
mire
eaves
ceased
to
distil
their
sooty
rheum
even
in
the
of
lambeth
there
was
a
sunny
gleam
on
windows
and
a
clear
ring
in
all
the
sounds
of
life
it
was
saturday
between
egremont
and
grail
it
had
been
decided
that
the
latter
should
take
thyrza
to
inspect
the
house
egremont
had
gained
the
surly
compliance
of
the
caretaker
the
most
liberal
treatment
made
no
difference
in
the
strange
old
woman
moroseness
and
grail
promising
himself
pleasure
from
thyrza
surprise
said
nothing
more
than
that
he
wished
to
see
her
at
three
in
the
afternoon
the
sisters
did
not
come
home
together
from
their
work
lydia
had
an
engagement
with
isaacs
of
whom
we
have
heard
and
went
to
snatch
a
pretence
of
a
dinner
in
a
little
shop
to
which
she
resorted
when
there
was
need
thyrza
leaving
the
at
one
did
not
take
the
direct
way
to
walnut
tree
walk
the
sun
and
the
keen
air
filled
her
with
a
spirit
of
glad
life
and
a
thought
that
it
would
be
nice
to
see
how
her
future
home
looked
under
the
bright
sky
came
to
her
temptingly
the
distance
was
not
great
she
soon
came
to
brook
street
and
with
some
timidity
turned
up
the
narrow
passage
meaning
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
house
and
run
away
again
but
just
as
she
reached
the
entrance
to
the
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
someone
whom
she
at
once
knew
for
the
caretaker
whom
gilbert
had
described
to
her
the
old
woman
eye
held
her
she
was
half
frightened
yet
in
a
moment
found
words
she
said
it
seemed
to
her
the
only
way
of
explaining
her
intrusion
there
any
one
in
the
school
now
the
old
woman
examined
her
coldly
searchingly
there
ai
she
replied
it
you
as
is
to
live
here
this
was
something
like
witchcraft
to
thyrza
i
am
fell
from
her
lips
right
you
can
go
in
and
look
about
i
ai
get
nothink
to
hide
away
thyrza
was
in
astonishment
and
a
little
afraid
yet
she
dearly
wished
to
see
the
interior
of
the
house
the
old
woman
turned
and
she
followed
her
ai
no
need
for
me
to
go
draggin
about
with
you
said
the
caretaker
when
they
were
within
the
door
plenty
o
work
o
my
own
to
see
to
i
look
into
the
rooms
then
i
say
as
you
could
what
need
o
so
many
words
thyrza
hesitated
but
the
old
creature
having
begun
to
beat
a
she
resolved
to
go
forward
boldly
she
peeped
into
all
the
cheerless
chambers
then
returned
to
the
door
you
want
to
see
the
the
old
woman
asked
along
that
passage
and
mind
the
step
at
the
end
thyrza
was
bolder
now
the
aspect
of
the
house
had
not
depressed
her
for
she
knew
that
it
was
to
be
thoroughly
repaired
and
furnished
and
she
was
predisposed
to
like
everything
she
saw
it
would
be
her
home
hers
and
lyddy
the
dignity
of
occupying
a
whole
house
would
have
compensated
for
many
little
discomforts
thanking
the
old
woman
for
her
direction
she
went
along
the
dark
passage
and
came
into
the
large
and
this
was
to
be
filled
with
books
she
looked
at
the
maps
and
diagrams
for
a
few
moments
though
it
was
so
bright
a
day
the
place
still
kept
much
of
its
chill
and
gloom
gilbert
had
told
her
of
the
rooms
up
above
and
she
thought
she
might
as
well
complete
her
knowledge
of
the
building
by
seeing
them
at
the
first
landing
on
the
staircase
she
came
to
a
window
by
which
the
sun
streamed
in
brilliantly
the
rays
gladdened
her
it
was
nice
that
the
old
woman
had
remained
behind
the
sense
of
being
quite
alone
together
with
the
sudden
radiance
affected
her
with
a
desire
to
utter
her
happiness
and
as
she
went
on
she
sang
in
a
sweet
undertone
sang
without
words
pure
music
of
her
heart
in
one
of
the
two
rooms
above
egremont
happened
to
be
taking
certain
measurements
impatient
to
get
his
plans
completed
in
detail
he
had
resolved
to
come
for
half
an
hour
on
this
same
day
which
had
been
appointed
for
grail
visit
curious
as
he
was
to
see
the
woman
whom
grail
was
about
to
marry
as
yet
he
knew
nothing
more
of
her
than
her
casually
learnt
name
delicacy
prevented
him
from
using
the
opportunity
this
afternoon
would
give
the
two
were
to
arrive
at
three
and
long
before
that
time
he
would
have
finished
his
measuring
and
be
gone
and
now
he
was
making
his
last
notes
when
the
sound
of
as
sweet
a
voice
as
he
had
ever
heard
made
him
pause
and
listen
the
singer
was
approaching
her
voice
grew
a
little
louder
though
still
in
the
undertone
of
one
who
sings
but
half
consciously
he
caught
a
light
footstep
then
the
door
was
pushed
open
his
hand
fell
even
such
a
face
as
this
would
he
have
desired
for
her
whose
voice
had
such
a
charm
her
dress
told
him
her
position
the
greater
was
his
wonder
at
the
features
which
seemed
to
him
of
faultless
delicacy
more
than
that
of
beauty
which
appealed
to
him
as
never
beauty
had
yet
thyrza
stood
in
alarm
the
murmur
had
died
instantly
upon
her
lips
and
for
a
moment
she
met
his
gaze
with
directness
then
her
eyes
fell
her
cheeks
recovered
with
interest
the
blood
which
they
had
lost
she
turned
to
retreat
but
egremont
stepped
rapidly
forward
saying
the
first
words
that
came
to
him
do
let
me
be
in
your
way
i
this
moment
going
this
moment
from
her
singing
he
concluded
that
she
was
accustomed
to
be
here
thyrza
again
met
his
look
she
guessed
who
this
must
be
the
kindness
of
his
face
as
he
stood
before
her
caused
her
to
speak
the
words
she
was
thinking
you
egremont
sir
then
she
was
shocked
at
her
boldness
she
did
not
see
the
smile
with
which
he
replied
that
is
my
name
am
miss
trent
perhaps
you
have
perhaps
grail
has
told
you
this
miss
trent
this
gilbert
grail
wife
his
astonishment
scarcely
allowed
him
to
relieve
her
promptly
then
we
already
know
each
other
by
name
at
least
you
have
come
to
look
at
the
building
grail
is
downstairs
sir
i
came
in
alone
i
thought
i
should
like
to
see
course
you
have
been
over
the
house
he
wondered
rather
at
her
coming
alone
but
supposed
that
grail
was
withheld
by
some
business
sir
she
answered
afraid
you
think
it
does
look
very
promising
but
i
sure
we
can
do
a
great
deal
to
improve
it
think
it
very
nice
thyrza
said
not
at
all
out
of
politeness
but
because
she
did
indeed
think
so
will
do
my
best
to
make
it
so
as
soon
as
it
is
vacant
these
two
rooms
he
added
loth
to
take
leave
at
once
shall
use
for
lectures
have
you
been
into
the
other
one
he
led
the
way
taking
up
his
hat
from
the
desk
thyrza
was
overcoming
her
timidity
all
she
had
ever
heard
of
egremont
prepared
her
to
find
him
full
of
gentleness
and
courtesy
and
already
she
thought
that
far
too
little
had
been
said
in
his
praise
his
singular
smile
occupied
her
imagination
she
wished
to
keep
her
eyes
on
his
face
for
the
pleasure
of
following
its
changes
indeed
like
her
own
his
features
were
very
mobile
and
the
various
emotions
now
stirring
within
him
animated
his
look
she
kept
at
a
little
distance
from
him
and
listened
with
the
keenest
interest
to
all
he
said
when
he
paused
after
telling
her
the
number
of
books
he
had
decided
to
begin
with
she
said
grail
does
so
look
forward
to
it
i
sure
nothing
could
have
made
him
so
happy
egremont
was
pleased
with
a
note
of
sincerity
of
self
forgetfulness
in
these
words
he
replied
am
very
glad
i
know
he
be
at
home
among
books
are
you
fond
of
reading
sir
grail
lends
me
books
and
explains
what
i
understand
doubt
you
will
find
plenty
of
time
sir
i
sha
go
to
work
then
but
of
course
there
be
the
house
to
look
after
egremont
glanced
towards
the
windows
and
murmured
an
assent
thyrza
moved
a
little
nearer
the
door
think
i
go
now
i
seen
everything
am
going
myself
she
preceded
him
down
the
stairs
he
watched
her
ungloved
hand
touch
place
after
place
on
the
railing
watched
her
slightly
bent
head
with
its
long
braid
of
gold
and
the
knot
of
blue
ribbon
at
the
turning
to
the
lower
flight
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
profile
and
felt
that
he
would
not
readily
forget
its
perfectness
at
the
foot
he
asked
you
wish
to
pass
through
the
house
if
not
this
door
is
open
go
this
way
sir
she
just
raised
her
face
miss
trent
he
said
offering
his
hand
sir
then
he
opened
the
door
for
her
after
standing
for
a
few
moments
in
the
vestibule
he
went
to
speak
a
word
to
the
caretaker
thyrza
walked
home
looking
neither
to
right
nor
to
left
there
was
a
little
spot
of
colour
on
each
cheek
which
would
not
melt
away
reaching
the
room
upstairs
she
sat
down
without
taking
off
her
things
she
ought
to
have
prepared
her
dinner
but
did
not
think
of
it
and
at
length
she
was
startled
by
hearing
a
clock
strike
three
she
ran
down
to
the
grails
room
gilbert
and
his
mother
had
just
finished
their
meal
the
latter
gossiped
for
a
moment
then
went
out
want
you
to
go
somewhere
with
me
gilbert
said
i
quite
ready
but
have
something
to
tell
you
gilbert
i
wonder
whether
you
be
cross
was
i
cross
last
thyrza
but
i
not
sure
whether
i
ought
to
have
done
something
as
i
was
coming
home
i
thought
i
walk
past
the
house
when
i
got
there
i
thought
i
just
go
up
the
passage
and
look
and
that
old
woman
met
me
and
asked
me
if
it
was
me
that
was
going
to
live
there
how
did
she
know
gilbert
laughed
more
than
i
can
tell
that
is
all
she
said
i
might
go
in
and
look
about
if
i
liked
and
i
thought
i
would
did
i
do
wrong
she
saw
a
shade
of
disappointment
on
his
face
but
he
said
at
all
did
you
go
over
all
the
rooms
but
there
something
else
i
went
into
those
upstairs
never
thinking
there
was
any
one
there
because
the
old
woman
told
me
there
was
but
there
and
it
was
mr
egremont
did
he
knew
who
you
were
told
him
gilbert
he
laughed
again
and
there
was
a
look
of
pride
in
his
eyes
there
nothing
very
dreadful
yet
and
did
he
speak
nicely
very
nicely
and
when
i
went
away
he
shook
hands
a
very
queer
thing
that
you
happened
to
go
just
today
exactly
where
i
meant
to
take
you
this
afternoon
i
rather
disappointed
very
sorry
but
could
i
go
with
you
again
we
shall
be
alone
this
time
egremont
said
he
was
just
going
wo
tire
you
but
i
should
like
to
go
i
made
up
my
mind
which
be
room
i
wonder
whether
you
guess
the
same
along
then
chapter
xiv
mists
paula
tyrrell
was
married
at
easter
convenience
dictated
this
speed
in
other
words
paula
resolved
to
commence
the
season
as
dalmaine
and
in
a
house
of
her
own
dalmaine
had
pointed
out
the
advantage
of
using
the
easter
recess
as
there
was
scarcely
time
to
select
and
make
ready
an
abode
for
permanence
it
was
decided
to
take
a
house
in
kensington
which
friends
of
the
tyrrells
desired
to
let
for
the
year
annabel
was
not
present
at
the
wedding
it
was
the
second
week
in
march
before
newthorpe
felt
able
to
leave
ullswater
and
annabel
had
little
mind
to
leave
him
for
such
a
purpose
immediately
after
their
establishment
at
eastbourne
indeed
she
would
rather
not
have
attended
the
wedding
under
any
circumstances
her
father
had
been
gravely
ill
there
was
organic
disease
and
there
was
what
is
vaguely
called
nervous
breakdown
it
was
too
clear
that
newthorpe
must
count
upon
very
moderate
activity
either
of
mind
or
body
henceforth
he
himself
was
not
quite
unprepared
for
this
collapse
he
accepted
it
with
genial
pessimism
fate
had
said
that
his
life
was
to
result
in
nothing
nothing
that
is
from
the
point
of
view
of
his
early
aspirations
yet
there
was
annabel
and
in
her
the
memory
of
his
life
passion
as
he
lay
in
silence
through
the
days
when
spring
combated
with
winter
he
learned
acquiescence
after
all
he
was
among
the
happier
of
men
for
he
could
look
back
upon
a
few
days
of
great
joy
and
forward
without
ignoble
anxiety
he
felt
that
the
abandonment
of
ullswater
was
final
yet
would
not
say
so
to
annabel
ormonde
had
made
ready
a
house
at
a
short
distance
from
her
own
and
here
the
two
would
live
at
all
events
into
the
summer
beyond
that
all
must
hinge
on
circumstances
they
broke
the
journey
for
a
couple
of
days
in
london
staying
with
their
relatives
during
those
days
paula
behaved
very
prettily
a
certain
affection
had
grown
up
between
her
and
her
uncle
whilst
she
was
at
ullswater
and
the
meeting
under
these
dolefully
changed
conditions
touched
her
best
feelings
yet
with
her
cousin
she
was
reserved
her
behaviour
did
not
bear
out
the
evidence
of
latent
tenderness
and
admiration
contained
in
that
letter
of
hers
which
we
saw
annabel
had
looked
for
something
more
just
now
she
was
longing
for
affection
and
sympathy
and
paula
was
the
only
girl
friend
she
had
but
paula
would
only
speak
of
dalmaine
and
absurdest
thing
of
politics
annabel
retired
into
herself
she
was
glad
to
reach
at
length
the
quiet
house
by
the
sea
glad
to
be
near
ormonde
the
circumstances
of
annabel
early
life
had
worked
happily
with
her
inherited
disposition
her
father
had
he
been
free
to
choose
would
have
planned
her
training
differently
but
in
all
likelihood
with
less
advantage
than
she
derived
from
the
compromise
between
her
parents
though
at
the
time
of
her
mother
death
she
still
waited
for
formal
recognition
as
a
member
of
society
being
but
sixteen
she
was
of
riper
growth
than
the
majority
of
young
ladies
who
in
that
season
were
being
led
forth
for
review
and
to
perfect
themselves
in
arts
of
civilisation
from
her
mother
she
had
learnt
directly
or
indirectly
much
of
that
little
world
which
deems
the
greater
world
its
satellite
from
her
father
she
received
love
of
knowledge
and
reverence
for
the
nobler
modes
of
life
she
was
marked
by
a
happy
balance
of
character
all
that
came
to
her
from
without
she
seemed
naturally
to
assimilate
in
due
proportions
her
tastes
were
those
of
an
imaginative
temper
tending
to
joyousness
but
susceptible
of
grave
impressions
she
relished
books
yet
never
allowed
them
to
hold
her
from
bodily
exercise
she
knew
the
happiness
of
solitude
yet
could
render
welcomest
companionship
at
one
time
she
conversed
earnestly
with
those
older
and
wiser
than
herself
at
another
she
was
the
willing
playmate
of
laughing
girls
she
was
loved
by
those
who
could
by
no
possibility
have
loved
one
another
and
in
turn
she
seemed
to
discover
with
sure
insight
what
there
was
of
strength
and
beauty
in
the
most
diverse
characters
with
this
breadth
of
sympathy
she
developed
a
of
the
kind
to
which
most
women
never
attain
habitually
studying
herself
and
making
comparison
of
herself
with
others
she
cultivated
her
understanding
and
her
emotions
simultaneously
her
time
of
serious
study
only
began
when
she
exchanged
london
for
the
mountain
solitude
henceforth
her
father
influence
exerted
itself
freely
and
annabel
had
just
reached
the
age
for
profiting
most
by
it
her
bringing
up
between
a
brilliant
and
a
library
had
preserved
her
from
the
two
dangers
to
which
english
girls
of
the
class
are
mainly
exposed
she
escaped
puritanism
yet
was
equally
withheld
from
frivolous
worldliness
but
it
was
well
that
this
balance
admirably
maintained
thus
far
should
not
be
submitted
to
the
risks
of
such
a
life
as
awaited
her
if
there
had
come
no
change
of
conditions
she
would
be
a
beautiful
woman
and
was
not
unaware
of
it
her
social
instincts
which
society
would
straightway
do
its
best
to
abuse
might
outweigh
her
spiritual
tendencies
but
a
year
of
life
by
ullswater
consolidated
her
womanhood
she
bent
herself
to
books
with
eagerness
the
shock
of
sorrow
compelled
her
to
muse
on
problems
which
as
yet
she
had
either
not
realised
or
had
solved
in
the
light
of
tradition
childwise
her
mind
was
ripe
for
those
modern
processes
of
thought
which
hitherto
had
only
been
implicit
in
her
education
to
her
father
annabel
companionship
was
invaluable
she
repaid
richly
out
of
the
abundance
of
her
youthful
life
that
anxious
guidance
which
he
gave
to
her
thoughts
her
loving
tact
sweetened
for
him
many
an
hour
which
would
else
have
been
spent
in
profitless
brooding
when
the
signs
of
which
she
had
become
aware
warned
her
that
he
needed
to
be
drawn
from
himself
she
was
always
ready
with
her
bright
converse
her
priceless
sympathy
without
her
he
would
seldom
have
exerted
himself
to
wander
far
from
the
house
but
annabel
could
at
any
time
lead
him
over
hill
and
valley
by
pretending
that
she
had
need
of
a
holiday
their
communion
was
of
a
kind
not
frequently
existing
between
father
and
daughter
fellowship
in
study
made
them
mental
comrades
and
respect
for
each
other
intellectual
powers
was
added
to
their
natural
love
what
did
they
not
discuss
from
classical
archaeology
to
the
theories
of
the
day
in
art
and
science
something
of
all
passed
at
one
time
or
another
under
their
scrutiny
yet
there
was
the
limit
imposed
by
fine
feeling
newthorpe
never
tried
to
pass
the
sacred
bound
which
parts
a
father
province
from
that
of
a
mother
there
was
much
in
the
girl
heart
that
he
would
gladly
have
read
yet
could
not
until
she
should
of
herself
reveal
it
to
him
for
instance
they
did
not
very
often
speak
of
egremont
when
a
letter
arrived
from
him
newthorpe
always
gave
it
to
annabel
to
read
at
other
times
that
was
a
subject
on
which
he
spoke
only
when
she
introduced
it
after
walter
departure
there
had
been
one
conversation
between
them
in
which
annabel
told
what
had
come
to
pass
she
went
so
far
as
to
speak
of
a
certain
trouble
she
had
on
paula
account
think
you
must
use
your
philosophy
with
regard
to
paula
her
father
replied
course
i
know
nothing
of
the
circumstances
but
he
smiled
not
unkindly
child
i
think
i
know
pretty
well
do
be
troubled
i
have
confidence
in
egremont
have
the
same
feeling
in
truth
father
annabel
said
i
feel
nothing
more
than
that
let
it
rest
dear
i
certainly
have
no
desire
to
lose
you
so
much
between
them
thereafter
both
spoke
of
egremont
when
at
all
in
an
unconstrained
way
annabel
showed
frank
interest
in
all
that
concerned
him
but
as
far
as
newthorpe
could
discern
nothing
more
than
the
interest
of
friendliness
as
the
months
went
on
he
discerned
no
change
her
life
was
as
cheerful
and
as
steadily
industrious
as
ever
nothing
betrayed
unsettlement
of
the
thought
if
her
father
by
chance
entered
the
room
where
she
studied
he
found
her
bent
over
books
her
face
beautiful
in
calm
zeal
the
first
grave
symptoms
of
illness
in
her
father
opened
a
new
chapter
of
annabel
life
it
was
time
to
lay
aside
books
for
a
little
the
fated
scheme
of
her
existence
required
at
this
point
new
experiences
the
student
habit
does
not
readily
reconcile
itself
to
demands
for
practical
energy
and
endurance
and
when
the
first
strain
of
love
was
relaxed
annabel
fell
for
a
few
days
into
grievous
weakness
of
despondency
summoned
from
her
study
to
all
the
miseries
of
a
it
was
mere
nervous
force
that
failed
her
when
her
father
had
his
relapse
she
was
able
to
face
the
demand
upon
her
more
sternly
but
the
trial
through
which
she
was
passing
was
a
severe
one
with
the
invalid
she
could
keep
a
bright
face
and
make
her
presence
as
ever
a
blessing
to
him
alone
she
cared
no
longer
for
her
books
nor
for
the
beauty
that
was
about
her
home
you
remember
that
passage
in
her
letter
to
egremont
world
seems
to
me
very
dark
and
life
a
dreadful
penalty
she
could
have
uttered
much
on
that
text
to
one
from
whom
she
had
had
no
secret
one
day
when
newthorpe
was
again
recovering
strength
there
came
a
letter
from
tyrrell
which
announced
the
date
of
paula
marriage
annabel
received
the
letter
to
read
as
she
was
sitting
with
her
father
a
little
later
he
said
with
a
return
of
his
humorous
mood
wonder
on
what
footing
egremont
will
be
in
the
new
household
suppose
annabel
replied
acquaintance
with
dalmaine
will
continue
to
be
of
the
slightest
he
paused
a
little
then
quietly
am
glad
of
this
marriage
annabel
said
nothing
proves
he
continued
we
did
well
in
not
thinking
too
gravely
of
a
certain
incident
annabel
led
the
conversation
away
she
had
singular
thoughts
on
this
subject
paula
letter
first
announcing
the
engagement
made
mention
of
egremont
in
a
curious
way
and
it
was
at
least
a
strange
hap
that
paula
should
be
about
to
marry
the
man
against
whom
egremont
had
expressed
such
an
antipathy
her
father
said
no
more
but
annabel
had
a
new
care
for
her
dark
mood
to
feed
upon
she
felt
that
the
words
am
glad
of
this
concerned
herself
they
meant
that
her
father
was
glad
of
the
removal
of
what
was
perchance
one
barrier
between
egremont
and
herself
and
in
these
long
weeks
in
which
she
was
anguished
by
the
spectacle
of
suffering
it
had
become
her
first
desire
to
be
of
comfort
to
the
sufferer
her
ideal
of
a
placid
life
was
shattered
the
things
which
availed
her
formerly
now
seemed
weak
to
rely
upon
in
so
dark
a
world
what
guidance
was
there
save
by
the
hand
of
love
with
egremont
she
was
in
full
intellectual
sympathy
and
the
thought
of
becoming
his
wife
had
no
painful
associations
but
could
she
bring
herself
to
abandon
that
ideal
of
love
which
had
developed
with
her
own
development
must
she
relinquish
the
hope
of
a
great
passion
and
take
the
hand
of
a
man
whom
she
merely
liked
and
respected
it
was
a
question
she
must
decide
for
walter
when
they
again
met
might
again
seek
to
win
her
the
idealism
which
she
derived
from
her
father
would
not
allow
her
yet
to
regard
life
as
a
compromise
which
women
are
so
skilled
in
doing
practically
though
the
better
part
in
them
to
the
end
revolts
yet
who
was
she
that
life
should
bestow
its
highest
blessing
upon
her
when
at
the
tyrrells
house
in
london
she
feared
lest
egremont
should
come
tyrrell
spoke
much
of
him
the
first
evening
lamenting
that
he
had
so
withdrawn
himself
from
his
friends
but
he
did
not
come
at
eastbourne
newthorpe
health
began
to
improve
even
in
a
week
the
change
was
very
marked
he
seemed
to
have
taken
a
resolve
to
restore
the
old
order
of
things
by
force
of
will
doubtless
his
conversations
with
ormonde
about
annabel
were
an
incentive
to
effort
relieved
from
the
weight
of
suffering
he
could
see
that
the
girl
was
not
herself
on
paula
marriage
day
he
said
in
the
course
of
conversation
with
annabel
aunt
desires
very
much
to
have
you
with
her
for
a
part
of
the
season
what
do
you
think
of
it
would
you
care
to
go
up
in
may
annabel
did
not
at
once
reject
the
idea
is
my
opinion
that
you
need
some
such
change
her
father
continued
last
quarter
of
a
year
has
done
you
harm
in
a
month
i
hope
to
be
sound
enough
will
think
of
it
she
said
and
there
the
subject
rested
the
town
was
secretly
attracting
her
the
odour
of
the
tyrrells
house
had
exercised
a
certain
seduction
though
she
saw
but
one
or
two
old
acquaintances
there
the
the
brought
the
past
vividly
back
to
her
she
was
not
so
wholly
alien
to
her
blood
that
the
of
the
world
was
without
appeal
to
her
and
circumstances
were
favourable
to
a
revival
of
that
element
in
her
character
which
i
touched
upon
when
speaking
of
her
growth
out
of
childhood
it
is
a
common
piece
of
observation
that
studious
gravity
in
youth
is
succeeded
by
a
desire
for
action
and
enjoyment
disposition
to
study
did
not
return
though
quietness
was
once
more
restored
to
her
surroundings
and
thus
though
the
settlement
at
eastbourne
seemed
a
relief
she
soon
found
that
it
did
not
effect
all
she
hoped
her
father
began
to
take
up
his
books
again
though
in
a
desultory
way
annabel
could
not
do
even
that
a
portion
of
each
day
she
spent
with
ormonde
often
she
walked
by
herself
on
the
shore
a
book
was
seldom
in
her
hand
two
or
three
days
before
the
end
of
march
newthorpe
spoke
of
egremont
should
like
to
see
him
may
i
ask
him
to
come
and
spend
a
day
with
us
annabel
by
all
means
father
she
answered
ormonde
heard
from
him
yesterday
he
came
into
possession
of
his
the
other
day
will
write
then
this
was
monday
on
wednesday
morning
egremont
came
the
nine
months
or
so
which
had
passed
since
these
three
met
had
made
an
appreciable
change
in
all
of
them
when
egremont
entered
the
room
where
father
and
daughter
were
expecting
him
he
was
first
of
all
shocked
at
the
wasting
and
ageing
of
newthorpe
face
then
surprised
at
the
difference
he
found
in
annabel
this
too
of
a
kind
that
troubled
him
he
thought
her
less
beautiful
than
she
had
been
with
no
picture
of
her
to
aid
him
he
had
for
long
periods
been
unable
to
make
her
face
really
present
to
his
mind
eye
one
of
the
sources
of
his
painful
debates
with
himself
when
it
came
as
faces
do
at
unanticipated
moments
he
saw
her
as
she
looked
in
walking
back
with
him
from
the
when
she
declared
that
the
taste
of
the
rain
was
sweet
is
it
not
the
best
of
life
that
involuntary
flash
of
memory
upon
instants
of
the
eager
past
better
than
present
joy
in
which
there
is
ever
a
core
of
disappointment
better
far
better
than
hope
which
can
not
warm
without
burning
annabel
was
surpassingly
beautiful
as
he
knew
her
in
that
brief
vision
beautiful
she
still
was
but
it
was
as
if
a
new
type
of
loveliness
had
come
between
her
and
his
admiration
he
could
regard
her
without
emotion
the
journey
from
london
had
been
one
incessant
anticipation
tormented
with
doubt
would
her
presence
conquer
him
royally
assure
her
dominion
convert
his
intellectual
fealty
to
passionate
desire
he
regarded
her
without
emotion
yet
annabel
was
not
so
calm
as
she
wished
to
be
only
by
force
of
will
could
she
exchange
greetings
without
evidence
of
more
than
friendly
pleasure
this
irritated
her
for
up
to
an
hour
ago
she
had
said
that
his
coming
would
in
no
way
disturb
her
when
after
an
hour
talk
she
left
her
father
and
the
guest
together
and
went
up
to
her
room
the
first
feeling
she
acknowledged
to
herself
was
one
of
disappointment
egremont
had
changed
and
not
she
thought
for
the
better
he
had
lost
something
perchance
that
freshness
of
purpose
which
had
become
him
so
well
he
seemed
to
talk
of
his
undertakings
less
spontaneously
and
in
a
tone
she
could
not
quite
say
what
it
was
but
his
tone
perhaps
suggested
the
least
little
lack
of
sincerity
and
her
agitation
when
he
entered
the
room
it
had
meant
nothing
nothing
her
nerves
were
weak
that
was
all
she
wished
she
could
shed
tears
there
was
no
cause
for
it
surely
none
save
a
physical
need
such
a
feeling
was
very
strange
to
her
they
had
luncheon
then
as
his
custom
was
newthorpe
went
apart
to
rest
for
a
couple
of
hours
ormonde
was
coming
to
dine
the
hour
of
the
meal
would
be
early
to
allow
of
egremont
return
to
town
in
the
meantime
the
latter
obtained
annabel
consent
to
a
walk
they
took
the
road
ascending
to
beachy
head
still
have
opportunity
of
climbing
egremont
said
a
modest
scale
but
i
am
not
regretting
the
mountains
the
sea
i
think
is
more
to
me
at
present
they
were
not
quite
at
ease
together
conversation
turned
about
small
things
and
was
frequently
broken
the
day
was
not
very
bright
and
mist
spoiled
the
view
landwards
the
sea
was
at
ebb
and
sluggish
annabel
of
her
own
accord
reverted
to
lambeth
must
have
had
many
pleasures
arising
from
your
work
she
said
one
above
all
i
envy
you
i
mean
that
of
helping
poor
grail
so
well
that
is
a
real
happiness
he
answered
thoughtfully
idea
of
making
him
librarian
came
to
me
almost
at
the
same
moment
as
that
of
establishing
the
library
i
did
know
then
all
that
it
would
mean
to
him
i
was
fortunate
in
meeting
that
man
one
out
of
thousands
must
be
deeply
grateful
to
you
are
good
friends
i
respect
him
more
than
i
can
tell
you
i
think
you
could
find
a
man
in
whatever
position
of
more
sterling
character
his
love
of
knowledge
touches
me
as
something
ideal
it
is
monstrous
to
think
that
he
might
have
spent
all
his
life
in
that
candle
factory
annabel
reflected
for
a
moment
then
a
look
of
pleasure
fighted
her
face
and
she
spoke
with
a
revival
of
the
animation
which
had
used
to
appeal
so
strongly
to
his
sympathies
what
one
can
do
you
become
a
sort
of
providence
to
a
man
indeed
you
change
his
fate
you
give
him
a
new
commencement
of
life
what
a
strange
thought
that
is
do
you
feel
it
as
i
do
i
think
and
can
you
understand
that
it
has
sometimes
shamed
me
just
because
i
happen
to
have
money
i
can
do
this
is
it
a
poor
sordid
world
not
one
man
but
perhaps
a
hundred
could
be
raised
into
a
new
existence
by
what
in
my
hands
is
mere
superfluity
of
means
does
such
a
thought
make
life
a
great
foolish
game
suppose
me
saying
is
a
thousand
pounds
shall
i
buy
a
yacht
to
play
with
or
shall
i
lift
a
living
man
soul
out
of
darkness
into
light
he
broke
off
and
laughed
bitterly
annabel
glanced
at
him
she
noticed
that
thoughts
of
this
cast
were
now
frequent
in
his
mind
though
formerly
they
had
been
strange
to
him
he
used
to
face
problems
with
simple
directness
in
the
positive
spirit
or
with
an
enthusiasm
now
he
leaned
to
scepticism
though
it
was
his
endeavour
to
conceal
the
tendency
she
was
struck
with
the
likeness
of
this
change
in
him
to
that
which
she
herself
was
suffering
yet
it
did
not
touch
her
sympathies
and
she
was
anxious
forthwith
to
avoid
coincidence
with
him
yourself
offer
the
answer
to
that
she
replied
very
fact
that
you
have
exerted
such
power
never
mind
by
what
means
puts
you
in
a
relation
to
that
man
which
is
anything
but
idle
or
foolish
is
it
rather
a
great
and
moving
thing
that
one
can
be
a
source
of
such
vast
blessing
to
another
money
is
only
the
accident
it
is
the
kindness
the
human
feeling
that
has
to
be
considered
you
show
what
the
world
might
be
if
all
men
were
human
if
i
could
do
one
act
like
that
egremont
i
should
cry
with
gratitude
he
looked
at
her
and
found
the
annabel
of
his
memory
with
the
exception
of
ormonde
he
knew
no
woman
who
spoke
thus
from
heart
and
intellect
at
once
the
fervour
of
his
admiration
was
rekindled
is
to
you
one
should
come
for
strength
he
said
the
world
weighs
too
heavily
annabel
was
sober
again
you
often
go
and
see
him
at
his
house
she
asked
speaking
of
grail
am
going
on
friday
night
i
have
not
been
since
that
one
occasion
which
i
mentioned
in
a
letter
to
newthorpe
i
had
to
write
to
him
yesterday
about
the
repair
of
the
house
he
is
going
to
live
in
and
in
his
reply
this
morning
he
asked
me
to
come
for
an
hour
talk
were
curious
father
told
me
about
the
wife
he
had
chosen
have
you
seen
her
yet
she
is
quite
a
young
girl
he
was
looking
at
a
sail
and
as
he
replied
his
eyes
kept
the
same
direction
annabel
asked
no
further
question
egremont
laughed
before
he
spoke
again
absurdly
one
conjectures
about
unknown
people
i
suppose
it
was
natural
to
think
of
grail
marrying
someone
not
quite
young
and
very
grave
i
hope
she
is
grave
enough
to
be
his
fitting
companion
he
opened
his
lips
but
altered
the
words
he
was
about
to
speak
only
saw
her
for
a
few
minutes
a
chance
meeting
she
impressed
me
favourably
they
walked
in
a
leisurely
way
for
about
half
an
hour
then
turned
mists
were
creeping
westward
over
pevensey
and
the
afternoon
air
was
growing
chill
there
was
no
sound
from
the
sea
which
was
divided
lengthwise
into
two
tracts
of
different
hue
that
near
the
land
a
pale
green
that
which
spread
to
the
horizon
a
cold
grey
nothing
passed
between
them
which
could
recall
their
last
day
together
nothing
beyond
that
one
exclamation
of
egremont
which
annabel
hardly
appeared
to
notice
neither
desired
to
prolong
the
conversation
yet
neither
had
ever
more
desired
than
now
annabel
said
to
herself
is
over
she
was
spared
anxious
the
currents
of
their
lives
were
slowly
but
surely
carrying
them
apart
from
each
other
when
she
came
into
the
to
offer
tea
her
face
was
brighter
as
if
she
had
experienced
some
relief
ormonde
had
not
seen
egremont
for
some
six
weeks
the
tone
of
the
one
or
two
letters
she
had
received
from
him
did
not
reassure
her
against
misgivings
excited
at
his
latest
visit
to
her
he
wrote
far
more
truly
than
to
newthorpe
and
she
knew
what
the
others
did
not
that
he
was
anything
but
satisfied
with
the
course
he
had
taken
since
christmas
in
his
lecturing
easter
was
her
advice
to
your
plain
instruction
it
is
more
fruitful
of
profit
both
to
your
hearers
and
to
yourself
but
egremont
had
begun
to
doubt
whether
after
easter
he
should
lecture
at
all
bunce
little
girl
is
coming
to
me
again
she
said
in
the
talk
before
dinner
know
the
poor
little
thing
has
been
in
hospital
for
three
weeks
have
heard
of
it
egremont
replied
sorry
that
i
really
come
to
know
bunce
i
had
a
short
talk
with
him
a
month
ago
and
he
told
me
then
that
his
children
were
well
but
he
is
so
reticent
that
i
have
feared
to
try
further
to
get
his
confidence
bunce
is
the
aggressive
atheist
is
he
said
newthorpe
ormonde
smiled
and
nodded
fear
he
is
a
man
of
misfortunes
she
said
friend
at
the
hospital
tells
me
that
his
wife
was
small
comfort
to
him
whilst
she
lived
she
left
him
three
young
children
to
look
after
and
the
eldest
of
them
she
is
about
nine
is
always
ill
there
seems
to
be
no
one
to
tend
them
whilst
their
father
is
at
work
will
bring
the
child
here
egremont
asked
came
by
herself
last
time
but
i
hear
she
is
still
very
weak
perhaps
someone
will
have
to
be
sent
from
the
hospital
during
dinner
the
library
was
discussed
egremont
reported
that
workmen
were
already
busy
in
the
and
in
grail
house
in
correspondence
he
said
a
man
i
knew
some
years
ago
a
scientific
fellow
who
has
heard
somehow
of
my
undertakings
and
wrote
asking
if
he
might
help
by
means
of
natural
science
perhaps
it
might
be
well
to
begin
a
course
of
that
kind
in
one
of
the
rooms
it
would
appeal
far
more
to
the
lambeth
men
than
what
i
am
able
to
offer
this
project
passed
under
review
then
egremont
himself
led
the
talk
to
widely
different
things
and
thereafter
resisted
any
tendency
it
showed
to
return
upon
his
special
affairs
annabel
was
rather
silent
an
hour
after
dinner
egremont
had
to
depart
to
catch
his
train
he
took
leave
of
his
friends
very
quietly
shall
come
and
see
the
library
as
soon
as
it
is
open
said
newthorpe
egremont
smiled
merely
newthorpe
remarked
that
egremont
seemed
disappointed
with
the
results
of
his
work
should
uncommonly
like
to
hear
one
of
these
new
lectures
he
said
expect
there
plenty
of
sound
matter
in
them
my
fear
is
lest
they
are
over
the
heads
of
his
audience
fear
said
ormonde
is
waste
both
of
his
time
and
that
of
the
men
but
the
library
will
cheer
him
there
is
something
solid
at
all
events
that
can
scarcely
fail
of
results
think
most
of
grail
put
in
annabel
true
woman
said
ormonde
with
a
smile
let
the
individual
come
before
the
crowd
and
all
agreed
that
in
gilbert
grail
was
the
best
result
hitherto
of
egremont
work
chapter
xv
a
second
visit
to
walnut
tree
walk
the
man
of
reserve
betrays
happiness
by
disposition
for
companionship
surprised
that
the
world
all
at
once
looks
so
bright
to
his
own
eyes
he
desires
to
learn
how
others
view
it
the
unhappy
man
is
intensely
subjective
his
own
impressions
are
so
inburnt
that
those
of
others
seem
to
him
unimportant
nay
impertinent
and
what
is
so
bitter
as
the
spectacle
of
alien
joy
when
one
own
heart
is
waste
gilbert
grail
was
no
longer
the
silent
and
lonely
man
that
he
had
been
the
one
with
whom
he
had
formed
something
like
a
friendship
had
gone
apart
in
the
nature
of
things
ackroyd
and
he
could
never
again
associate
as
formerly
though
when
need
was
they
spoke
without
show
of
estrangement
but
others
whom
he
had
been
wont
to
hold
at
a
distance
by
his
irresponsiveness
were
now
of
interest
to
him
and
after
the
first
surprise
at
the
change
in
him
they
met
his
quiet
advances
in
a
friendly
way
among
his
acquaintances
there
were
of
course
few
fitted
to
be
in
any
sense
his
associates
two
however
he
induced
to
attend
egremont
lectures
thus
raising
the
number
of
the
audience
to
eight
these
recruits
were
not
enthusiastic
over
for
the
present
one
of
them
persevered
to
the
end
of
the
course
the
other
made
an
excuse
for
absenting
himself
after
two
evenings
gilbert
held
seriously
in
mind
the
pledge
he
had
given
to
egremont
to
work
for
the
spread
of
humane
principles
one
of
those
with
whom
he
often
spoke
of
these
matters
was
bunce
himself
a
man
made
hard
to
approach
by
rude
experiences
bunce
was
a
locksmith
some
twelve
years
ago
he
had
had
a
little
workshop
of
his
own
but
a
disastrous
marriage
brought
him
back
to
the
position
of
a
journeyman
and
at
present
he
was
as
often
out
of
work
as
not
happily
his
wife
was
dead
he
found
it
a
hard
task
to
keep
his
three
children
the
truth
was
that
his
domestic
miseries
had
when
at
their
height
driven
him
to
the
and
only
by
dint
of
struggles
which
no
soul
save
his
own
was
aware
of
was
he
gradually
recovering
and
the
trust
of
employers
his
attendance
at
egremont
lectures
was
part
of
the
cure
though
it
was
often
hard
to
go
out
at
night
and
leave
his
little
ones
he
did
so
that
his
resolve
might
not
suffer
he
and
they
lived
in
one
room
in
the
same
house
which
sheltered
miss
totty
nancarrow
on
the
evening
which
egremont
spent
at
eastbourne
grail
came
across
bunce
on
the
way
home
from
the
factory
they
resumed
a
discussion
interrupted
a
day
or
two
before
and
as
they
passed
the
end
of
newport
street
bunce
asked
his
companion
to
enter
for
the
purpose
of
looking
at
a
certain
paper
in
which
he
had
found
what
seemed
to
him
cogent
arguments
they
went
up
the
dark
musty
staircase
and
entered
the
room
opposite
to
totty
bunce
cried
finding
no
light
up
nellie
jack
it
was
usual
since
the
eldest
child
was
at
the
hospital
for
the
landlady
to
come
and
light
a
lamp
for
the
two
little
ones
when
it
grew
dusk
bunce
had
an
exaggerated
fear
of
giving
trouble
and
only
sheer
necessity
had
compelled
him
to
request
this
small
service
be
downstairs
i
suppose
he
muttered
striking
a
match
the
hungry
room
had
no
occupants
on
the
floor
lay
a
skeleton
doll
a
toy
tambourine
a
and
a
wried
tin
whistle
there
was
one
bedstead
and
a
bed
made
up
on
a
mattress
laid
on
the
floor
on
a
round
clothless
table
stood
two
plates
one
with
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
remaining
and
two
cups
and
saucers
the
fire
had
died
out
a
shrill
voice
was
calling
from
below
stairs
bunce
bunce
your
children
is
gone
out
with
miss
nancarrow
as
far
as
the
butcher
they
wo
be
more
than
five
minutes
i
was
to
say
if
you
came
in
you
ladds
bunce
replied
briefly
he
came
in
and
closed
the
door
a
new
thing
he
said
as
if
doubtful
whether
to
be
satisfied
or
not
hope
she
wo
begin
taking
about
still
she
is
a
bad
lot
that
girl
do
you
know
anything
of
her
yes
i
heard
of
her
often
from
miss
trent
is
she
a
good
deal
with
ackroyd
say
she
not
a
bad
lot
she
going
to
take
my
bessie
down
to
eastbourne
at
the
end
of
the
week
why
do
you
go
yourself
it
would
do
you
good
bunce
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
ca
go
myself
just
for
the
child
sake
i
have
to
put
up
with
that
kind
of
thing
but
i
do
like
it
it
charity
after
all
and
i
could
face
those
people
at
the
home
home
is
it
grail
asked
he
knew
but
out
of
delicacy
wished
the
explanation
to
come
from
bunce
do
know
as
it
has
any
name
it
seems
to
be
in
connection
with
the
children
hospital
the
matron
or
whatever
you
call
her
is
a
mrs
ormonde
i
know
about
her
gilbert
exclaimed
a
friend
of
egremont
he
spoken
of
her
once
or
twice
to
me
you
need
be
afraid
of
meeting
she
a
lady
who
has
given
up
her
own
house
for
this
purpose
as
good
a
woman
i
believe
as
lives
said
bunce
doggedly
thankful
to
her
but
i
ca
face
her
what
this
i
like
to
know
his
eye
caught
something
that
looked
like
a
small
pamphlet
lying
near
the
fireplace
he
stooped
to
pick
it
up
they
beginning
to
throw
my
papers
about
the
sudden
silence
caused
gilbert
to
look
at
him
bunce
was
not
a
man
but
ordinarily
a
rugged
honesty
helped
the
misfortunes
of
his
features
a
sort
of
too
which
seemed
unable
to
find
free
play
but
of
a
sudden
his
face
had
become
ferocious
startling
in
its
exasperated
surprise
its
savage
wrath
his
eyes
glared
his
teeth
were
uncovered
his
jaws
protruded
as
if
in
an
animal
impulse
to
rend
this
got
here
he
almost
roared
brings
things
o
this
kind
into
my
room
who
put
this
into
my
children
hands
on
earth
is
it
gilbert
asked
in
amazement
is
it
look
at
that
look
at
that
i
say
if
this
is
the
landlady
work
i
find
a
new
room
this
very
night
gilbert
tried
to
take
the
paper
but
bunce
hand
which
trembled
violently
held
it
with
such
a
grip
that
there
was
no
getting
possession
of
it
with
difficulty
grail
perceived
that
it
was
a
religious
tract
there
no
great
harm
done
he
said
children
ca
read
can
they
can
the
boy
can
i
teaching
him
myself
he
raved
the
sight
of
that
propagandist
document
affected
him
to
use
the
old
simile
as
scarlet
does
a
bull
gilbert
knew
the
prejudices
but
in
his
own
more
cultured
mind
could
not
have
conceived
such
frenzy
of
hatred
as
this
piece
of
christian
doctrine
excited
in
bunce
for
five
minutes
the
poor
fellow
was
possessed
sweat
covered
his
face
he
was
shaken
as
if
by
bodily
anguish
he
read
scraps
aloud
commenting
on
them
with
scornful
violence
last
of
all
he
flung
the
paper
to
the
ground
and
trampled
it
into
shreds
gilbert
had
at
first
difficulty
in
refraining
from
laughter
then
he
sat
down
and
waited
with
some
impatience
for
the
storm
to
spend
itself
come
bunce
he
said
when
he
could
make
himself
heard
egremont
lecture
on
those
things
i
think
pretty
much
as
you
do
about
christianity
about
the
dogmas
that
is
but
we
no
need
to
fear
it
in
this
way
let
take
what
good
there
is
in
it
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
foolish
parts
bunce
seated
himself
exhausted
not
a
few
among
the
intelligent
artisans
of
our
time
are
filled
with
that
spirit
of
hatred
against
all
things
christian
in
him
it
had
become
a
mania
egremont
eirenicon
had
been
a
hard
saying
to
him
he
had
tried
to
think
it
over
because
of
his
respect
for
the
teacher
but
as
yet
it
had
resulted
in
no
sobering
his
mind
was
not
sufficiently
prepared
for
lessons
of
wisdom
had
egremont
witnessed
this
scene
he
might
well
have
groaned
in
spirit
over
the
ineffectualness
of
his
prophesying
gilbert
spoke
with
earnestness
to
him
his
friend
teaching
had
come
as
true
and
refreshing
and
he
could
not
lose
such
an
opportunity
as
this
of
pushing
on
the
work
he
insisted
on
the
beauty
there
was
in
the
christian
legend
on
its
profound
spiritual
significance
on
the
poverty
of
all
religious
schemes
which
man
had
devised
to
replace
it
want
no
religion
cried
bunce
angrily
been
the
curse
of
the
world
look
at
the
inquisition
look
at
the
religious
wars
look
at
the
jesuits
he
was
primed
with
such
historic
instances
out
of
books
and
pamphlets
spread
broadcast
by
the
contemporary
apostles
of
thought
of
history
proper
he
of
course
knew
nothing
but
these
splinters
of
evidence
had
run
deep
into
his
flesh
despise
him
if
you
like
but
try
to
understand
him
it
was
his
very
humaneness
which
brought
him
to
this
pass
recitals
of
old
savagery
had
poisoned
his
blood
and
the
of
the
age
churned
his
crude
acquisitions
into
a
witch
cauldron
academic
sweetness
and
light
was
a
feeble
antidote
to
offer
him
gilbert
soothed
his
companion
for
the
time
he
knew
where
to
stop
and
promised
himself
to
find
a
fitter
season
for
pursuing
the
same
subject
just
as
he
had
reverted
to
the
topic
of
conversation
which
brought
him
here
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
in
growled
bunce
totty
nancarrow
appeared
one
of
her
hands
led
a
little
fellow
of
seven
a
bright
lad
munching
a
the
other
a
little
girl
a
year
younger
who
exclaimed
as
she
entered
a
walk
with
miss
nanco

the
butcher

miss
nancarrow

declared
the
boy
consciously
improving
on
his
sister
report
totty

drawn
back
a
step
at
the
sight
of
grail
he
and
she
knew
each
other
by
sight
but
had
not
yet
exchanged
words
found
them
in
the
dark
bunce

said
half
laughing
ladds

out
and
could
get

time

lamp

do
mind
i
thought
a
little
bit
of
a
walk

softened
at
the
sight
of
his
little
ones
much
obliged
to
you
miss
nancarrow
he
said
nanco
bought
me
sweets
remarked
little
nelly
when
her
father
had
drawn
her
between
his
knees
and
she
exhibited
a
lollipop
her
brother
hid
away
his
own
delicacy
feeling
all
at
once
that
it
compromised
his
masculine
superiority
i
very
angry
with
miss
nanco
replied
bunce
hope
never
do
anything
o
the
kind
again
totty
laughed
and
drew
back
into
the
passage
thence
she
said
i
speak
to
you
a
minute
mr
bunce
he
went
out
to
her
and
half
closed
the
door
behind
him
totty
led
him
a
step
or
two
down
the
stairs
then
whispered
so

bunce

room
and
closed
the
door
gilbert

taken
nelly
on
his
knee
and
was
satisfying
her
by
tasting
the
remnant
of
lollipop
say
jack
cried
the
father
his
eye
again
catching
sight
of
the
bruised
tract
on
the
floor
brought
that
here
did
father
answered
the
youngster
stoutly
though
he
saw
displeasure
in
his
father
face
did
you
get
it

asked
sharply
lady

it
me
at
the
door

to
gilbert
who
was
waiting
to
depart
nancarrow

to
eastbourne
on
saturday
but
she
says
miss
trent
very
anxious
to
go
instead
of
her
what
do
you
think
of
it
grail
reflected
the
plan
pleased
him
on
the
whole
though
he
had
just
a
doubt
whether
thyrza
ought
to
travel
by
herself
see
no
reason
why
she
should
he
said
be
a
pleasure
to
her
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
her
do
you
the
kindness
could
i
see
her
before
saturday
in
night
will
you
the
second
course
of
lectures
was
at
an
end
egremont
had
only
delivered
one
a
week
since
christmas
and
even
so
it
cost
him
no
little
effort
to
spread
his
for
the
present
over
the
three
months
latterly
he
had
blended
a
good
deal
of
historical
disquisition
with
his
prophecy
the
result
was
to
himself
profoundly
unsatisfactory
he
sighed
with
relief
as
he
dismissed
his
poor
little
audience
for
the
last
time
for
the
future
he
had
made
no
promises
beyond
saying
that
in
his
there
were
two
rooms
which
were
to
be
devoted
to
lectures
the
library
itself
was
now
his
chief
care
this
was
something
solid
it
would
him
in
his
yes
for
the
present
had
been
a
failure
the
first
lecture
was
far
away
the
best
it
dealt
with
religion
addressed
to
an
audience
ready
for
such
philosophical
views
it
would
have
met
with
a
flattering
reception
egremont
point
of
view
was
strictly
the
aesthetic
he
aimed
at
replacing
religious
enthusiasm
as
commonly
understood
by
aesthetic
the
loveliness
of
the
christian
legend
from
that
he
started
he
dealt
with
the
new
testament
very
much
as
he
had
formerly
dealt
with
the
elizabethan
poets
he
would
have
no
appeal
to
the
vulgar
by
aggressive
rationalists
let
rationalism
filter
down
in
the
course
of
time
the
vulgar
were
not
prepared
for
it
as
yet
it
was
bad
that
they
should
be
superstitious
but
worse
far
worse
that
they
should
be
brutally
irreverent
and
brutal
irreverence
inevitably
came
of
atheism
preached
at
the
street
corner
the
men
who
preached
it
were
themselves
the
very
last
to
guide
human
souls
they
were
of
coarsest
fibre
without
a
note
of
music
in
them
fit
only
for
the
world
grosser
purposes
and
they
presumed
to
attack
the
ministry
of
christ
it
was
good
all
that
he
had
to
say
on
that
point
the
better
that
it
made
two
or
three
of
his
hearers
feel
a
little
sore
and
indignant
yet
as
a
whole
the
lecture
appealed
to
but
one
of
the
audience
gilbert
grail
heard
it
with
emotion
and
carried
it
away
in
his
heart
to
the
others
it
was
little
more
than
the
sounding
of
brass
and
the
tinkling
of
cymbals
friday
he
was
going
to
grail
of
course
no
ceremonious
preparation
was
necessary
yet
he
wasted
a
couple
of
hours
previous
to
his
time
for
setting
forth
he
could
not
apply
himself
to
anything
he
paced
his
room
indeed
he
had
paced
his
room
much
of
late
week
by
week
he
seemed
to
have
grown
more
unsettled
in
mind
he
had
said
to
himself
that
all
would
be
well
when
he
had
seen
annabel
he
had
seen
her
and
his
trouble
was
graver
than
before
at
the
hour
when
egremont
set
out
for
lambeth
lydia
was
busy
dressing
her
sister
hair
perhaps
such
a
thing
had
never
happened
before
as
that
thyrza
hair
should
have
needed
doing
twice
in
one
day
she
had
begged
it
this
evening
wo
mind
lyddy
i
feel
it
rough
and
i
think
i
ought
to
look
nice
do
you
a
vain
little
thing
do
think
i
am
lyddy
it
only
natural
a
moment
or
two
and
thyrza
said
i
think
you
ought
to
come
down
as
well
told
you
that
i
sha
so
do
have
done
dear
it
only
because
i
want
you
to
see
mr
egremont
seen
him
and
that
enough
if
you
going
to
be
a
lady
and
make
friends
with
grand
people
that
no
reason
why
i
should
have
to
some
day
do
think
i
shall
said
lydia
as
she
began
the
braiding
and
me
are
very
different
dear
i
shall
go
on
in
my
own
way
keep
still
am
i
to
tie
this
ribbon
me
lyddy
say
that
you
love
me
do
think
i
shall
dear
it
was
said
so
gravely
that
lydia
having
finished
her
task
came
round
before
the
chair
and
looked
in
her
sister
face
think
i
should
die
if
i
had
someone
to
love
me
do
think
you
ever
want
that
thyrza
the
other
drew
a
profound
sigh
so
profound
that
it
left
her
bosom
trembling
and
for
a
few
moments
she
sat
in
a
dream
then
she
proceeded
to
change
her
dress
and
make
ready
for
her
formal
appearance
downstairs
on
the
occasion
of
egremont
visit
she
had
never
been
so
anxious
to
look
well
lydia
affected
much
impatience
with
her
but
in
truth
was
profoundly
happy
in
her
sister
happiness
she
looked
often
at
the
beautiful
face
and
thought
how
proud
gilbert
must
be
you
think
i
ought
to
shake
hands
with
mr
egremont
thyrza
asked
he
offers
to
you
must
was
lydia
opinion
not
if
he
does
did
when
he
said
at
the
school
before
long
they
heard
the
expected
double
knock
at
the
they
had
left
their
own
door
ajar
that
they
might
not
miss
this
signal
thyrza
sprang
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
listened
she
heard
gilbert
admit
his
visitor
and
she
heard
the
latter
voice
it
was
now
a
month
since
the
meeting
at
the
school
but
the
voice
sounded
so
exactly
as
she
expected
that
it
brought
back
every
detail
of
that
interview
and
made
her
heart
throb
with
excitement
she
was
now
to
wait
a
whole
quarter
of
an
hour
down
and
read
said
lydia
who
had
herself
begun
to
sew
in
the
usual
methodical
way
thyrza
pretended
to
obey
for
two
minutes
she
sat
still
then
asked
how
they
were
to
know
when
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
passed
tell
you
said
the
other
quiet
there
a
good
baby
and
i
buy
you
a
cake
next
time
we
go
out
thyrza
drew
in
her
breath
and
somehow
the
time
was
lived
through
i
think
you
may
go
lydia
said
thyrza
seemed
to
have
become
indifferent
she
turned
over
a
page
of
her
book
and
at
length
rose
very
slowly
lydia
watched
her
askance
she
thought
she
saw
signs
of
timidity
but
thyrza
presently
moved
to
the
door
and
went
downstairs
with
her
lightest
step
gilbert
had
told
her
not
to
knock
her
hand
was
on
the
knob
some
moments
before
she
ventured
to
turn
it
she
heard
egremont
laughing
his
natural
laugh
which
was
so
attractive
and
then
there
fell
a
silence
she
entered
no
gilbert
had
not
seated
his
visitor
in
the
easy
chair
that
must
be
reserved
for
someone
of
more
importance
egremont
rose
with
a
look
of
pleasure
know
miss
trent
already
gilbert
said
to
him
thyrza
drew
near
she
did
not
hear
very
distinctly
what
egremont
was
saying
but
certainly
he
was
offering
to
shake
hands
then
gilbert
placed
the
easy
chair
in
a
convenient
position
and
she
did
her
best
to
sit
as
she
always
did
her
manner
was
not
awkward
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
be
awkward
but
she
was
afraid
of
saying
something
that
grammar
and
to
egremont
agreeable
remarks
she
replied
shortly
yet
even
this
only
gave
her
an
air
of
shyness
which
was
itself
a
grace
when
grail
had
entered
into
the
conversation
she
was
able
to
collect
herself
gilbert
said
presently
trent
is
going
to
take
bunce
child
to
eastbourne
to
mrs
ormonde
egremont
exclaimed
was
there
on
wednesday
and
heard
that
the
child
was
coming
but
this
arrangement
had
been
made
then
i
think
somebody
else
was
to
have
gone
but
she
has
found
she
ca
will
be
glad
to
know
ormonde
i
sure
egremont
said
to
thyrza
i
glad
to
go
to
the
seaside
thyrza
returned
never
seen
the
sea
you
how
i
wish
i
could
have
your
enjoyment
of
then
grail
was
knitting
she
said
think
you
have
voyaged
a
great
deal
sir
it
led
to
talk
of
travel
egremont
was
drawn
into
stories
of
east
and
west
ah
how
good
it
was
to
get
out
of
the
circle
of
social
prophecy
it
was
like
breathing
the
very
mid
atlantic
sky
to
talk
gaily
and
freely
of
things
wherein
no
theory
was
involved
which
left
aside
every
ideal
save
that
of
joyous
living
thyrza
listened
he
he
before
her
had
trodden
lands
whereof
the
names
were
to
her
like
echoes
from
fairy
tales
he
had
passed
days
and
nights
on
the
bosom
of
the
great
sea
which
she
looked
forward
to
beholding
almost
with
fear
he
had
seen
it
in
tempest
and
the
laughing
descriptions
he
gave
of
vast
green
rolling
mountains
made
to
her
inward
sight
an
awful
reality
never
thought
of
going
to
one
of
the
colonies
egremont
asked
of
gilbert
years
ago
was
the
reply
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
sees
the
trouble
of
life
behind
him
think
at
one
time
my
mother
rather
despised
me
because
i
could
make
up
my
mind
to
go
and
seek
my
fortune
never
despised
you
my
dear
said
the
old
lady
that
was
when
some
friends
of
ours
were
sending
wonderful
news
from
australia
sir
and
i
believe
i
did
half
try
to
persuade
gilbert
to
go
his
health
was
very
bad
and
i
thought
it
might
have
done
him
good
in
all
ways
remarked
gilbert
talks
of
going
to
canada
said
egremont
not
surprised
to
hear
that
thyrza
had
looked
at
gilbert
anxiously
told
you
that
she
asked
told
me
himself
thyrza
last
night
she
saw
that
egremont
was
gazing
at
her
her
eyes
fell
and
she
became
silent
egremont
in
the
course
of
the
talk
wondered
at
his
position
in
this
little
room
he
knew
that
it
was
one
of
very
few
houses
in
lambeth
in
which
he
could
have
been
at
his
ease
perhaps
there
was
not
another
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
thrown
off
a
great
deal
that
was
artificial
in
behaviour
and
in
habits
of
speech
that
he
had
reverted
to
that
self
which
came
to
him
from
his
parents
and
he
felt
better
for
the
change
the
air
of
simplicity
in
the
room
and
its
occupants
was
healthful
of
natural
refinement
there
was
abundance
only
affectation
was
missing
would
it
have
been
a
hardship
if
his
father
had
failed
to
amass
money
and
he
had
grown
up
in
such
a
home
as
this
he
knew
well
enough
that
by
going
say
next
door
he
could
pass
into
a
domestic
sphere
of
a
very
different
kind
to
the
midst
of
a
life
compact
of
mean
slavery
of
ignorance
of
grossness
this
was
enormously
the
exception
but
his
own
home
would
have
been
not
unlike
this
poverty
could
not
have
taken
away
his
birthright
of
brains
and
perhaps
some
such
piece
of
luck
might
have
fallen
to
him
as
had
now
to
gilbert
grail
perhaps
too
why
not
indeed
he
would
have
known
thyrza
trent
certainly
he
would
have
seen
her
by
chance
here
or
there
in
lambeth
and
he
the
young
workman
he
might
have
been
assuredly
would
not
have
let
her
pass
and
forget
her
why
in
that
case
perchance
he
might
have
he
had
lost
himself
for
a
moment
thyrza
was
standing
before
him
with
a
cup
of
tea
he
noticed
that
the
cup
shook
a
little
in
the
saucer
you
have
some
tea
sir
she
said
grail
had
been
perturbed
somewhat
on
the
question
of
refreshments
gilbert
decided
that
to
offer
a
cup
of
tea
would
be
the
best
thing
egremont
he
knew
dined
late
and
would
not
want
anything
to
eat
you
miss
trent
she
brought
him
sugar
and
milk
this
was
quite
her
own
idea
people
do
take
sugar
some
do
take
milk
so
you
ought
to
let
them
help
themselves
to
such
things
he
took
both
she
noticed
his
hand
how
shapely
it
was
how
beautiful
the
were
and
then
he
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
of
thanks
not
more
than
of
thanks
could
anyone
convey
thanks
more
graciously
hope
egremont
said
turning
to
gilbert
as
he
stirred
his
tea
we
shall
get
our
first
books
on
the
shelves
by
the
first
day
of
next
month
grail
made
no
reply
and
all
were
silent
for
a
little
the
visitor
did
not
remain
much
longer
to
the
end
he
was
animated
in
his
talk
making
his
friends
feel
as
much
at
their
ease
as
he
was
himself
when
he
was
about
to
depart
he
said
to
thyrza
hope
you
will
have
a
fine
day
there
is
promise
of
it
i
think
it
be
fine
she
replied
would
be
too
cruel
if
it
was
surely
thought
egremont
as
he
smiled
to
you
if
to
any
one
the
sky
should
show
a
glad
face
how
many
a
time
thereafter
did
he
think
of
those
words
would
be
too
cruel
she
could
not
believe
that
fortune
would
be
unkind
to
her
she
had
faith
in
the
undiscovered
day
chapter
xvi
sea
music
returning
to
the
upper
room
thyrza
sat
down
as
if
she
were
very
tired
i
do
want
anything
to
eat
she
said
to
lydia
shall
go
to
bed
at
once
we
must
be
up
very
early
in
the
morning
still
she
made
no
preparations
her
mirth
and
excitement
were
at
an
end
her
eyelids
drooped
heavily
and
one
of
her
hands
hung
down
by
the
side
of
the
chair
lydia
showed
no
extreme
desire
for
an
account
of
the
proceedings
below
yes
thyrza
said
she
had
enjoyed
herself
and
presently
egremont
says
he
wants
to
begin
putting
up
the
books
by
the
first
of
may
he
say
when
the
house
would
be
ready
thyrza
shook
her
head
then
told
us
about
foreign
countries
he
been
everywhere
told
me
he
had
been
to
america
is
canada
the
same
as
america
believe
it
is
said
the
other
doubtfully
think
it
is
a
part
america
a
very
big
country
you
know
do
you
think
gilbert
says
he
says
ackroyd
told
him
last
night
that
he
was
going
to
canada
lydia
gave
no
sign
of
special
interest
he
do
think
he
means
it
he
take
totty
nancarrow
with
him
remarked
lydia
with
a
scarcely
noticeable
touch
of
irony
the
other
did
not
reply
but
she
looked
pained
then
lydia
declared
that
she
too
was
weary
they
talked
little
more
though
it
was
a
long
time
before
either
got
to
sleep
thyrza
saw
grail
in
the
breakfast
hour
next
morning
and
received
his
advice
for
the
day
bunce
had
already
conveyed
the
little
box
of
bessie
clothing
to
the
hospital
thence
thyrza
and
the
child
would
go
in
a
cab
to
victoria
she
was
at
the
hospital
by
nine
bessie
a
weakly
coughing
child
who
seemingly
had
but
a
short
term
of
suffering
before
her
was
at
first
very
reticent
with
thyrza
but
when
they
were
seated
together
in
the
train
at
victoria
she
brightened
in
the
expectation
of
renewing
her
experiences
of
ormonde
home
and
at
length
talked
freely
bessie
was
very
old
she
had
long
known
the
difficulties
of
a
pinched
home
and
of
her
own
ailments
she
spoke
with
a
curious
gravity
as
little
as
could
be
my
chest
as
is
weak
she
said
nurse
says
it
get
stronger
as
i
get
older
but
it
my
belief
that
it
just
the
other
way
about
you
never
had
a
weak
chest
had
you
miss
trent
you
that
look
i
dessay
you
always
well
i
should
mind
if
i
was
the
same
she
laughed
and
made
herself
cough
ca
see
why
everybody
should
be
well
father
says
the
world
made
wrong
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
truth
perhaps
it
looks
different
to
you
miss
trent
had
better
call
me
thyrza
bessie
that
my
name
it
well
i
do
mind
if
do
i
never
knew
anybody
called
thyrza
but
i
dessay
it
a
lady
name
you
a
lady
ai
you
i
not
a
lady
i
go
to
work
with
miss
nancarrow
you
know
her
ca
say
as
i
know
her
she
lives
in
the
next
room
to
us
but
we
do
often
speak
but
i
remember
now
i
seen
yea
on
the
stairs
nancarrow
has
made
friends
with
your
brother
and
sister
whilst
you
been
in
the
hospital
she
now
they
did
tell
me
about
that
when
they
come
to
see
me
last
time
i
suppose
things
is
all
upside
down
by
rights
i
ought
to
have
gone
home
for
a
day
or
two
just
to
see
that
the
room
was
clean
larrop
comes
in
wunst
a
week
you
know
she
a
charwoman
but
i
have
much
trust
in
her
she
such
a
one
for
the
children
do
make
such
a
mess
i
always
tell
them
they
think
twice
about
coming
in
with
dirty
shoes
if
only
they
had
the
cleaning
to
see
after
then
she
began
to
talk
of
ormonde
and
thyrza
encouraged
her
to
tell
all
she
could
about
that
lady
tell
you
what
thyrza
said
bessie
confidentially
nelly
gets
old
enough
to
keep
things
straight
and
look
after
father
do
you
know
what
i
shall
do
i
mean
to
go
to
ormonde
and
ask
to
be
took
on
for
a
housemaid
that
just
what
suit
me
my
chest
ai
so
bad
when
i
there
and
i
rather
be
one
of
ormonde
servants
than
work
anywhere
else
but
then
i
perhaps
sha
live
long
enough
for
that
it
a
great
thing
for
carrying
people
off
is
a
weak
chest
both
grew
excited
as
the
train
neared
their
destination
bessie
recalled
the
stations
and
here
and
there
an
object
by
the
way
it
was
thyrza
who
felt
herself
the
child
the
train
entered
the
station
bessie
had
her
head
at
the
window
she
drew
it
back
exclaiming
ormonde
see
thyrza
the
lady
in
black
thyrza
looked
timidly
that
lady
face
encouraged
her
ormonde
had
seen
bessie
and
was
soon
at
the
carriage
door
here
you
are
again
was
her
kindly
greeting
bessie
you
must
have
been
spending
all
your
time
in
growing
she
kissed
the
child
whose
thin
face
was
coloured
with
pleasure
is
miss
trent
mum
said
bessie
pointing
to
her
companion
who
had
descended
to
the
platform
been
so
kind
as
to
take
care
of
me
ormonde
turned
quickly
round
trent
she
viewed
the
girl
with
surprise
which
she
found
it
impossible
to
conceal
at
once
then
she
said
to
thyrza
you
the
young
lady
of
whom
i
have
heard
as
grail
friend
thyrza
replied
modestly
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
come
let
us
get
bessie
box
taken
to
the
carriage
ormonde
was
not
of
those
philanthropists
who
in
the
midst
of
their
are
preoccupied
with
the
necessity
of
preserving
the
distinction
between
classes
she
always
fetched
the
children
from
the
station
in
her
own
unpretending
carriage
her
business
was
to
make
them
happy
as
the
first
step
to
making
them
well
and
whilst
they
were
with
her
she
was
their
mother
there
are
plenty
of
people
successfully
engaged
in
reminding
the
poor
of
the
station
to
which
providence
has
called
them
the
insignificant
few
who
indulge
a
reckless
warmth
of
heart
really
can
not
be
seen
to
do
appreciable
harm
ormonde
mum
whispered
bessie
when
they
were
seated
in
the
carriage
is
it
bessie
you
take
us
round
by
the
front
road
miss
trent
has
never
seen
the
sea
and
she
like
to
as
soon
as
she
can
it
only
natural
ormonde
had
cast
one
or
two
discreet
glances
at
thyrza
as
she
did
so
her
smile
subdued
itself
a
little
a
grave
thought
seemed
to
pass
through
her
mind
she
at
once
gave
an
order
to
the
coachman
in
compliance
with
bessie
request
grail
is
quite
well
i
hope
she
said
feeling
a
singular
embarrassment
in
addressing
thyrza
thyrza
replied
mechanically
to
ride
in
an
open
carriage
with
a
lady
this
alone
would
have
been
an
agitating
experience
the
almost
painful
suspense
with
which
she
waited
for
the
first
glimpse
of
the
sea
completed
her
inability
to
think
or
speak
with
coherence
her
eyes
were
fixed
straight
onwards
ormonde
continued
to
observe
her
occasionally
saying
something
in
a
low
voice
to
the
child
the
carriage
drove
to
the
esplanade
and
turned
to
pass
along
it
in
the
westerly
direction
the
tide
was
at
full
a
loud
surge
broke
upon
the
beach
no
mist
troubled
the
blue
line
of
horizon
ormonde
looked
seawards
and
her
vision
found
a
renewal
in
sympathy
with
the
thought
she
had
read
on
thyrza
face
you
and
i
can
not
remember
the
moment
when
the
sense
of
infinity
first
came
upon
us
we
have
thought
so
much
since
then
and
have
assimilated
so
much
of
others
thoughts
that
those
first
impressions
are
become
as
vague
as
the
memory
of
our
first
love
but
thyrza
would
not
forget
this
vision
of
the
illimitable
sea
live
how
long
she
might
she
had
scarcely
heretofore
been
beyond
the
streets
of
lambeth
at
a
burst
her
consciousness
expanded
in
a
way
we
can
not
conceive
you
know
that
she
had
no
religion
yet
now
her
heart
could
not
contain
the
worship
made
forgetful
of
all
else
by
the
passionate
instinct
which
ruled
her
being
she
suddenly
leaned
forward
and
laid
her
hand
on
ormonde
the
latter
took
and
pressed
it
smiling
kindly
bessie
happy
in
her
superior
position
looked
about
her
with
a
satisfied
air
she
sat
with
ormonde
on
the
presently
she
leaned
aside
to
look
westward
and
informed
thyrza
that
the
promontory
visible
before
them
was
beachy
head
thyrza
had
no
response
to
utter
the
carriage
turned
inland
again
thyrza
lost
sight
of
the
sea
as
if
she
cared
to
look
at
nothing
else
her
eyes
fell
when
they
arrived
at
the
chestnuts
ormonde
led
her
companions
to
an
upper
room
where
mapper
sat
talking
with
two
or
three
children
think
bessie
can
have
her
old
bed
ca
she
she
said
after
introducing
thyrza
wonder
whether
she
knows
any
of
our
children
now
i
dare
say
miss
trent
would
like
to
rest
a
little
a
few
words
were
spoken
to
the
matron
apart
and
ormonde
withdrew
half
an
hour
later
thyrza
after
seeing
the
children
and
all
that
portion
of
the
house
which
was
theirs
was
led
by
mapper
to
the
the
lady
of
the
house
was
there
alone
she
invited
her
guest
to
sit
down
and
began
to
talk
you
obliged
to
be
home
could
you
stay
with
us
till
thyrza
checked
a
movement
promised
grail
to
be
back
before
dark
she
said
but
that
will
scarcely
leave
you
any
time
at
all
is
there
any
other
need
for
you
to
return
suppose
i
telegraphed
to
say
that
i
was
keeping
you
would
grail
forgive
me
think
i
might
stay
if
i
could
be
back
by
i
must
go
to
work
on
monday
morning
ormonde
sighed
involuntarily
that
work
that
work
the
consumer
of
all
youth
and
joy
there
no
train
that
would
help
us
thyrza
longed
to
stay
the
other
could
read
her
face
well
enough
an
early
train
on
monday
morning
she
continued
doubtfully
you
live
with
parents
no
my
parents
died
a
long
time
ago
i
live
with
my
sister
we
two
have
a
room
to
ourselves
it
in
the
same
house
where
grail
lives
that
how
i
got
to
know
him
is
your
sister
older
than
yourself
four
years
older
her
name
lydia
we
always
kept
together
when
i
married
she
coming
to
live
with
us
ormonde
listened
with
ever
deepening
interest
she
formed
a
picture
of
that
elder
sister
the
words
always
kept
together
touched
her
inexpressibly
they
bore
so
beautiful
a
meaning
on
lips
would
your
sister
lydia
scold
me
very
much
if
i
made
you
lose
your
monday
morning
work
she
asked
smiling
it
always
the
other
way
lyddy
always
glad
when
i
get
a
holiday
but
i
never
like
her
to
have
to
go
to
work
alone
now
i
shall
telegraph
to
lyddy
and
then
tomorrow
i
shall
write
a
letter
to
her
and
beg
her
to
forgive
me
if
i
do
so
do
you
think
you
could
stay
i
think
so
mr
grail
just
as
kind
to
me
as
lyddy
is
i
think
we
wo
be
afraid
the
telegram
shall
go
at
once
so
that
if
there
were
real
need
for
your
return
they
would
have
time
to
reply
the
message
despatched
they
talked
till
fulfilment
of
joy
soon
put
an
end
to
thyrza
embarrassment
she
told
all
about
her
life
and
lydia
about
their
work
about
boddy
about
gilbert
and
his
books
ormonde
led
her
gently
on
soothed
by
the
music
in
the
afternoon
she
decided
to
drive
with
thyrza
to
the
top
of
beachy
head
on
the
morrow
the
sky
might
not
be
so
favourable
to
the
view
the
children
would
go
out
in
the
usual
way
she
preferred
to
be
alone
with
her
visitor
for
a
while
they
have
the
telegraph
yet
thyrza
asked
as
she
again
seated
herself
in
the
carriage
long
since
we
could
have
had
an
answer
before
now
thyrza
sighed
with
contentment
for
she
knew
that
lyddy
was
glad
on
her
behalf
so
now
the
keen
breath
of
the
sea
folded
her
about
and
made
warmth
through
her
whole
body
it
sang
in
her
ears
the
eternal
sea
music
which
to
infinite
generations
of
mortals
has
been
an
inspiring
joy
upward
upward
on
the
long
sweep
of
the
climbing
road
whilst
landward
the
horizon
retired
from
curve
to
curve
off
the
wild
downs
and
on
the
other
hand
a
dark
edge
against
the
sky
made
fearful
promise
of
precipitous
shore
the
great
of
heaven
moved
grandly
on
before
the
west
wind
ever
changing
outline
meeting
to
incorporate
mass
with
mass
sundering
with
magic
softness
and
silence
the
bay
of
pevensey
spread
with
graceful
line
its
white
fringe
of
breakers
now
low
upon
the
strand
far
away
to
the
cliffs
of
hastings
thyrza
exclaimed
when
ormonde
had
mentioned
the
name
that
where
the
battle
of
hastings
was
little
further
inland
you
have
read
of
that
grail
is
teaching
me
history
yes
i
know
about
hastings
what
country
do
you
think
you
would
come
to
if
you
went
right
over
the
sea
yonder
must
be
really
where
william
the
conqueror
came
from
that
was
normandy
in
france
france
is
over
there
france
no
it
was
too
hard
to
believe
she
murmured
the
name
to
herself
gilbert
had
shown
it
her
on
the
map
but
how
difficult
to
transfer
that
dry
symbol
into
this
present
reality
they
left
the
carriage
near
the
coastguard
house
and
walked
forward
to
the
brow
of
the
great
cliffs
ormonde
took
thyrza
hand
as
they
drew
near
they
stood
there
for
a
long
time
two
or
three
other
people
were
walking
about
the
head
in
talking
ormonde
became
aware
that
someone
had
approached
her
she
turned
her
head
and
saw
annabel
newthorpe
they
shook
hands
quietly
thyrza
drew
a
little
away
you
alone
ormonde
asked
i
have
walked
do
you
think
this
is
ormonde
murmured
quickly
future
wife
she
has
just
brought
one
of
my
children
down
i
am
going
to
keep
her
till
monday
come
and
speak
the
most
loveable
child
thyrza
and
annabel
were
presented
to
each
other
with
the
pleasant
informality
which
ormonde
so
naturally
employed
each
was
impressed
with
the
other
beauty
thyrza
felt
not
a
little
awe
and
annabel
could
not
gaze
enough
at
the
lovely
face
which
made
such
a
surprise
for
her
did
egremont
give
me
no
suggestion
of
this
she
said
to
herself
she
had
noticed
in
drawing
near
how
intimately
her
friend
and
the
stranger
were
talking
together
her
arrival
had
disturbed
confidence
she
herself
did
not
feel
able
to
talk
quite
freely
so
in
a
few
minutes
she
turned
and
went
by
the
footway
along
the
edge
of
the
height
just
before
descending
into
a
hollow
which
would
hide
her
she
cast
a
look
back
and
saw
that
thyrza
eyes
were
following
her
how
could
he
speak
of
her
and
yet
tell
me
nothing
his
delicacy
explained
it
no
doubt
he
had
not
liked
to
say
of
the
simple
girl
whom
grail
was
to
marry
that
she
was
very
beautiful
annabel
felt
that
most
men
would
have
been
less
scrupulous
it
was
characteristic
of
egremont
to
feel
a
subtle
propriety
of
that
kind
annabel
was
at
all
times
disposed
to
interpret
egremont
motives
in
a
higher
sense
than
would
apply
to
the
average
man
on
her
return
thyrza
had
tea
with
mapper
and
the
children
then
went
with
them
to
the
large
room
upstairs
in
which
evenings
were
spent
till
the
early
bedtime
it
was
an
ideal
nursery
with
abundant
with
toys
with
everything
that
could
please
a
eye
and
engage
a
child
mind
there
was
a
piano
and
on
this
mapper
sometimes
played
the
kind
of
music
that
children
would
like
she
taught
them
songs
moreover
and
a
singing
evening
was
always
much
looked
forward
to
saturday
was
always
such
when
the
little
choir
had
got
a
song
perfect
ormonde
was
wont
to
come
up
and
hear
them
sing
it
making
them
glad
with
her
praise
it
happened
that
there
was
to
be
practising
of
a
new
song
mapper
had
chosen
laurie
and
she
began
by
playing
over
the
air
one
or
two
of
the
children
knew
it
but
not
the
words
these
it
was
found
were
always
very
quickly
learnt
by
singing
a
verse
a
few
times
over
you
know
laurie
miss
trent
mapper
asked
it
was
one
of
old
boddy
favourites
thyrza
had
sung
it
to
him
since
she
was
seven
years
old
us
sing
it
together
then
will
you
they
began
thyrza
was
already
thoroughly
at
home
and
this
music
was
an
unexpected
delight
after
a
line
or
two
mapper
voice
sank
thyrza
stopped
and
looked
inquiringly
meeting
a
wonder
in
the
eyes
mapper
was
a
woman
of
much
prudence
she
merely
said
find
i
got
a
little
cold
would
you
mind
singing
it
alone
so
thyrza
sang
the
song
through
a
moment
or
two
of
quietness
followed
i
think
you
soon
know
it
children
said
mapper
smith
i
see
you
got
it
already
miss
trent
will
be
kind
enough
to
sing
the
first
verse
again
you
sing
with
her
lizzie
and
you
too
mary
that
a
clever
girl
now
we
shall
get
on
the
practising
went
on
till
all
were
able
to
join
in
fairly
well
after
that
mapper
played
the
favourite
dance
tunes
and
the
children
danced
merrily
whilst
they
were
so
enjoying
themselves
ormonde
came
into
the
room
she
had
dined
and
wanted
thyrza
to
come
and
sit
with
her
for
she
was
alone
but
first
she
had
five
minutes
of
real
laughter
and
play
with
the
children
they
loved
her
every
one
of
them
and
clung
to
her
desperately
when
she
said
sue
could
stay
no
longer
she
said
waving
her
hand
at
the
door
no
cried
several
voices
yet
mrs
ormonde
of
course
there
is
she
laughed
that
no
reason
why
i
should
say
she
took
thyrza
hand
and
led
her
down
shall
have
some
supper
with
me
afterwards
she
said
little
ones
have
theirs
now
but
it
too
early
for
you
if
the
had
been
a
marvel
to
thyrza
in
the
daylight
it
was
yet
more
so
now
that
she
entered
it
and
found
two
delicately
shaded
lamps
giving
a
rich
uncertainty
to
all
the
beautiful
forms
of
furniture
and
ornaments
she
had
thought
the
grails
parlour
luxurious
and
the
dear
old
now
so
familiar
to
her
how
humble
it
was
compared
with
this
in
which
ormonde
seated
her
these
wonders
caused
her
no
envy
or
uneasy
desire
in
looking
at
a
glorious
altarpiece
one
does
not
feel
unhappy
because
one
can
not
carry
it
off
from
the
church
and
hang
it
up
at
home
thyrza
mood
was
purely
of
admiration
and
of
joy
in
being
deemed
worthy
to
visit
such
scenes
and
all
the
time
she
kept
saying
to
herself
whole
day
i
shall
be
by
the
sea
again
tomorrow
i
shall
sleep
and
wake
close
by
the
sea
presently
ormonde
had
to
absent
herself
for
a
few
minutes
heard
what
the
children
said
about
i
always
go
and
see
them
as
soon
as
they
are
tucked
up
in
bed
i
do
think
sleep
if
i
missed
the
kind
office
over
she
spoke
with
mapper
about
the
singing
you
know
the
latter
asked
a
voice
miss
trent
has
sings
i
did
know
was
so
delighted
that
i
had
to
stop
singing
myself
i
sure
it
a
wonderful
voice
i
must
ask
her
to
sing
to
me
she
found
thyrza
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
volume
of
photographs
without
speaking
she
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
began
to
play
gently
the
air
of
laurie
thyrza
looked
up
and
then
came
nearer
are
fond
of
music
said
ormonde
fond
how
beautiful
your
playing
is
you
shall
hear
miss
newthorpe
play
hers
is
much
better
will
you
sing
this
for
me
when
it
was
sung
she
asked
what
other
songs
thyrza
knew
they
were
all
of
course
such
as
the
people
sing
some
of
them
ormonde
did
not
know
at
all
but
to
others
she
was
able
to
play
an
accompaniment
her
praise
was
limited
to
a
few
kind
words
on
leaving
the
piano
she
was
thoughtful
at
ten
mapper
came
to
conduct
thyrza
to
her
bedroom
have
breakfast
at
eight
ormonde
said
i
am
up
in
time
thyrza
asked
i
go
out
before
breakfast
just
as
you
like
my
dear
the
other
answered
with
a
smile
want
you
to
enjoy
your
visit
in
spite
of
the
strangeness
of
her
room
and
of
the
multitude
of
thoughts
and
feelings
to
which
the
day
had
given
birth
thyrza
was
not
long
awake
she
passed
into
a
dreamland
where
all
she
had
newly
learnt
was
reproduced
and
glorified
but
the
rising
sun
had
not
to
wait
long
for
the
opening
of
her
eyes
she
sprang
from
bed
and
to
the
window
whence
however
she
could
only
see
the
tall
chestnuts
and
a
neighbouring
cottage
the
day
was
again
fine
she
dressed
with
nervous
speed
there
was
no
lyddy
to
do
her
hair
for
the
very
first
time
in
her
life
then
went
softly
forth
on
to
the
landing
no
one
seemed
to
be
stirring
she
had
no
watch
to
tell
her
the
time
but
doubtless
it
was
very
early
softly
she
began
to
descend
the
stairs
and
at
length
recognised
the
door
of
the
she
did
not
like
to
enter
it
was
only
ormonde
kindness
that
had
given
her
a
right
to
sit
there
the
evening
before
but
the
would
not
be
open
yet
she
feared
just
as
she
was
reluctantly
turning
to
go
up
and
wait
a
little
longer
in
her
bedroom
a
sound
below
at
once
startled
and
relieved
her
looking
over
the
banisters
she
saw
a
servant
coming
from
one
of
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
she
hurried
down
the
servant
looked
at
her
with
surprise
she
said
i
get
out
of
the
house
open
the
door
for
you
miss
time
is
it
please
is
quite
six
miss
you
an
early
riser
i
want
to
go
out
before
breakfast
please
will
you
tell
me
which
way
goes
to
the
sea
the
servant
gave
her
directions
and
thyrza
was
soon
running
along
with
a
glimpse
of
blue
horizon
for
guidance
she
ran
like
a
child
ran
till
the
sharp
morning
air
made
her
breathless
then
walked
until
she
was
able
to
run
again
and
at
length
she
was
on
the
beach
down
at
length
by
the
very
edge
of
the
waves
here
the
breeze
was
so
strong
that
with
difficulty
she
stood
against
it
but
its
rude
caresses
were
a
joy
to
her
each
breaker
seemed
a
living
thing
now
she
approached
timidly
now
ran
back
with
a
delicious
fear
she
filled
her
hands
with
the
smooth
a
trail
of
weed
with
the
foam
fresh
on
it
was
a
great
discovery
then
her
eye
caught
a
line
of
smoke
that
must
be
a
steamer
coming
from
a
foreign
country
perhaps
from
france
which
was
how
believe
it
yonder
across
the
blue
vast
you
have
watched
with
interest
some
bud
one
day
all
promise
is
shut
within
those
delicate
sepals
and
on
the
next
for
the
fulness
of
time
has
come
you
find
the
very
flower
with
its
glow
and
its
perfume
so
it
sometimes
happens
that
a
human
soul
finds
its
season
and
at
a
touch
expands
to
wonderful
new
life
ormonde
perceived
at
breakfast
that
thyrza
desired
nothing
more
than
to
be
left
to
pass
her
day
in
freedom
so
she
gave
her
visitor
a
little
bag
with
provision
against
seaside
appetite
and
let
her
go
forth
till
then
again
till
the
hour
of
tea
in
the
evening
thyrza
was
again
bidden
to
the
she
found
miss
newthorpe
there
now
and
tell
us
what
you
have
been
doing
all
day
long
ormonde
said
the
sun
and
the
wind
have
already
touched
your
cheeks
have
enjoyed
myself
thyrza
replied
quickly
seating
herself
near
her
new
friend
she
could
give
little
more
description
than
that
annabel
talked
with
her
and
presently
at
ormonde
request
went
to
the
piano
when
the
first
notes
had
sounded
thyrza
let
her
head
droop
a
little
music
such
as
this
she
had
not
imagined
when
annabel
came
back
to
her
seat
she
gazed
at
her
admiring
and
loving
will
you
sing
us
laurie
said
ormonde
play
for
you
is
that
child
future
ormonde
asked
of
annabel
when
thyrza
had
left
them
together
a
sad
one
i
think
said
annabel
musingly
her
husband
will
not
be
an
untaught
working
man
thank
goodness
for
that
i
suppose
they
will
be
married
in
two
or
three
weeks
her
voice
is
a
beautiful
thing
lost
wo
grieve
over
that
her
own
happiness
is
of
more
account
i
do
wish
father
could
have
seen
her
she
must
come
to
us
again
some
day
your
father
would
have
alarmed
her
too
much
have
you
felt
all
the
time
as
if
she
were
something
very
delicate
something
to
be
carefully
guarded
against
shocks
and
hazards
as
i
saw
her
from
my
window
going
out
of
the
garden
this
morning
i
felt
a
sort
of
fear
i
was
on
the
point
of
sending
a
servant
to
keep
watch
over
her
from
a
distance
there
was
a
silence
then
ormonde
murmured
wonder
whether
she
is
in
love
with
him
annabel
smiled
but
said
nothing
told
me
that
he
is
very
kind
to
her
as
kind
as
lyddy
she
said
indeed
who
would
be
have
every
reason
to
think
highly
of
grail
annabel
remarked
must
be
as
exceptional
in
his
class
as
she
is
but
the
exceptional
people
annabel
looked
inquiringly
mind
the
world
has
beautiful
things
in
it
and
one
of
the
most
beautiful
is
hope
chapter
xvii
adrift
it
was
partly
out
of
kindness
to
thyrza
that
totty
nancarrow
had
changed
her
mind
about
going
to
eastbourne
having
seen
her
and
mentioned
the
matter
totty
saw
at
once
how
eagerly
thyrza
would
accept
such
a
chance
but
it
happened
that
within
the
same
hour
she
saw
luke
ackroyd
and
luke
had
proposed
a
meeting
on
saturday
afternoon
totty
had
no
extreme
desire
to
meet
him
and
yet
perhaps
she
might
as
well
he
talked
of
going
up
the
river
to
battersea
park
as
the
weather
was
so
fine
so
at
three
on
saturday
totty
stood
by
the
at
lambeth
in
fact
she
was
there
at
least
five
minutes
before
the
appointed
time
but
her
punctuality
was
wasted
ten
minutes
past
three
by
lambeth
parish
church
and
no
ackroyd
i
call
this
nice
totty
exclaimed
to
herself
him
come
now
if
he
likes
he
wo
find
waiting
for
him
and
a
lot
i
care
she
went
off
humming
a
tune
and
swinging
her
hands
on
the
embankment
she
met
a
girl
she
knew
they
went
on
into
westminster
bridge
road
and
there
came
across
another
friend
it
was
decided
that
they
should
all
go
and
have
tea
at
totty
and
before
they
reached
newport
street
yet
another
friend
joined
them
the
more
the
merrier
totty
delighted
in
packing
her
tiny
room
as
full
as
it
would
hold
she
ran
into
bower
for
a
pot
of
jam
who
more
mirthful
now
than
totty
nancarrow
with
subdued
gossip
and
laughter
all
ran
up
the
narrow
staircase
and
into
totty
room
a
fire
had
first
of
all
to
be
lit
totty
was
a
deft
hand
at
that
not
a
girl
in
lambeth
could
start
a
blaze
and
have
her
kettle
boiling
in
sharper
time
on
a
cold
dark
morning
but
after
all
there
would
not
be
bread
enough
tilly
roach
would
be
off
for
that
you
bring
the
the
others
screamed
after
her
and
some
current
joke
seemed
to
be
involved
in
the
injunction
for
at
once
they
all
laughed
as
only
can
tilly
was
back
in
no
time
she
was
a
little
slim
girl
with
the
palest
and
shortest
of
gold
hair
and
a
pretty
face
spoilt
with
freckles
as
at
all
times
she
had
her
pocket
full
of
sweets
and
ate
them
incessantly
as
a
rule
tilly
can
not
have
eaten
less
than
a
couple
of
pounds
of
lollipops
every
week
and
doubtless
would
have
consumed
more
had
her
allowed
it
the
second
of
totty
guests
was
annie
west
whom
you
know
already
for
she
was
at
the
lead
when
thyrza
sang
she
was
something
of
a
scapegrace
constantly
laughed
in
a
shrill
note
and
occasionally
had
to
be
called
to
order
the
third
was
a
allchin
aged
fifteen
a
married
woman
of
two
months
date
her
hair
was
cut
across
her
forehead
she
wore
large
eardrops
and
over
her
jacket
hung
a
necklace
with
a
silver
locket
allchin
called
by
her
intimates
had
the
air
of
importance
which
became
her
position
there
were
only
two
chairs
in
the
room
the
table
had
to
be
placed
so
that
the
bed
could
serve
for
sitting
tablecloth
there
was
none
when
friends
did
her
the
honour
of
coming
to
tea
totty
spread
a
newspaper
the
was
to
say
the
least
primitive
four
cups
there
were
but
only
two
saucers
survived
and
a
couple
of
teaspoons
had
to
be
shared
harmoniously
no
one
ever
gave
a
thought
to
such
trifles
at
totty
nancarrow
whilst
the
kettle
boiled
annie
west
provided
diversion
of
a
literary
kind
she
had
recently
purchased
a
little
book
in
cover
of
yellow
paper
which
for
the
sum
of
one
penny
purported
to
give
an
exhaustive
description
of
spells
and
incantations
on
the
back
was
the
picture
of
a
moorish
maiden
with
eyes
thrown
up
in
prophetic
ecstasy
above
ran
the
legend
mysterious
and
peculiar
the
work
included
moreover
splendid
selection
of
the
best
love
songs
cheap
at
a
penny
was
miss
west
opinion
she
began
by
reading
out
an
infallible
charm
for
the
use
of
maidens
who
would
see
in
dreams
their
future
husband
it
was
the
charm

want

for
plait
a
band
of
your
own

and
tie
them
together
fastening
the
ends
with
nine
knots
fasten
them
with
one
of
your
garters
to
your
left
wrist
on
going
to
bed
and
bind
the
other
garter
round
your
head
then
say
peter
take
it
not
amiss
to

your
favour

done
this

then
if
you
please
let

then
your
influence

and
see
my
dear
and
wedded

this
must
be
done
on

laughter
but
they

to
tease

and
began
to
talk
from

to
the
other
about

signs
and
symbols

totty
did

choose
to

say
she
exclaimed

enough
about

tilly
make
yourself
useful
child
and
cut
some
bread
for
a
couple
of
hours
at
least
gossip
was
unintermittent
then
allchin
declared
that
her
husband
would
be
a
row
if
she
stayed
from
home
any
later
tilly
roach
took
leave
at
the
same
time
totty
and
miss
west
chatted
a
little
longer
then
put
on
their
hats
to
have
a
ramble
in
lambeth
walk
they
had
not
gone
many
paces
from
the
house
when
they
were
overtaken
by
some
one
who
said
i
want
to
speak
to
you
totty
would
not
look
round
it
was
ackroyd
voice
say
totty
but
she
walked
on
ackroyd
remained
on
the
edge
of
the
pavement
in
a
minute
or
two
he
saw
that
miss
nancarrow
was
coming
towards
him
unaccompanied
it
you
is
it
she
said
do
you
want
mr
ackroyd
did
you
come
this
afternoon
i
like
that
why
did
come
was
a
bit
late
i
really
could
help
it
totty
did
you
go
away
before
i
came
of
course
i
did
how
long
was
i
to
wait
very
sorry
let
go
somewhere
now
i
been
waiting
about
for
more
than
an
hour
on
the
chance
of
seeing
you
he
mentioned
the
chief
of
the
neighbourhood
do
mind
said
totty
i
ca
go
beyond
sixpence
all
right
i
see
to
that
you
wo
i
pay
for
myself
or
i
do
go
at
all
that
my
rule
you
like
the
place
of
entertainment
was
only
just
open
they
went
in
with
a
crowd
of
people
and
found
seats
the
prevailing
odours
of
the
hall
were
stale
beer
and
stale
tobacco
the
latter
was
speedily
freshened
by
the
fumes
from
pipes
ackroyd
ordered
a
glass
of
beer
and
deposited
it
on
a
little
ledge
before
him
an
arrangement
similar
to
that
for
different
purposes
in
a
church
pew
totty
would
have
nothing
ackroyd
had
changed
a
good
deal
during
the
last
few
months
the
coarser
elements
of
his
face
had
acquired
a
disagreeable
prominence
and
when
he
laughed
as
he
did
constantly
the
sound
lacked
the
old
genuineness
he
was
evidently
trying
hard
to
believe
that
he
enjoyed
the
entertainment
in
former
days
he
would
have
dismissed
anything
of
the
kind
with
a
few
contemptuous
words
when
the
people
about
him
roared
at
imbecilities
unspeakable
he
threw
back
his
head
and
roared
with
them
when
they
stamped
he
raised
as
much
dust
as
any
one
totty
had
no
need
to
affect
amusement
her
tendency
to
laughter
was
such
that
very
little
sufficed
to
keep
her
in
the
carelessly
merry
frame
of
mind
which
agreed
with
her
and
on
the
whole
it
was
not
disagreeable
to
be
sitting
by
luke
ackroyd
she
glanced
at
him
surreptitiously
at
times
he
drank
two
or
three
glasses
of
beer
then
felt
a
need
of
stronger
beverage
totty
remonstrated
with
him
he
laughed
and
drank
on
out
of
boastfulness
at
length
totty
would
countenance
it
no
longer
after
a
useless
final
warning
she
left
her
place
and
pressed
through
the
crowd
to
the
door
ackroyd
sprang
up
and
followed
her
his
face
was
flushed
and
grew
more
so
in
the
sudden
night
air
the
matter
he
said
putting
his
arm
through
the
girl
not
going
to
leave
me
in
that
way
totty
well
let
walk
about
then
here
ackroyd
began
totty
surprised
at
you
it
like
a
man
of
your
kind
to
go
muddling
his
head
night
after
night
in
this
way
know
that
as
well
as
you
do
totty
see
he
made
her
stop
and
added
in
a
lower
voice
you
marry
me
and
i
stop
it
from
told
you
already
i
sha
do
nothing
of
the
kind
so
do
be
silly
you
can
be
sensible
enough
if
you
like
and
then
i
can
get
along
well
enough
with
you
well
then
i
drink
for
another
week
and
then
be
off
to
canada
better
go
at
once
i
should
think
she
had
moved
a
little
apart
from
him
just
then
a
fellow
came
along
the
pavement
and
in
a
freak
caught
totty
about
the
waist
ackroyd
was
in
the
very
mood
for
an
incident
of
this
kind
in
an
instant
he
had
planted
so
direct
a
blow
that
the
fellow
staggered
back
into
the
gutter
totty
with
difficulty
preventing
herself
from
being
dragged
with
him
the
thoroughfare
was
crowded
street
urchins
ran
together
with
yells
of
anticipatory
delight
and
maturer
loafers
formed
the
wonted
ring
even
before
the
man
assaulted
had
recovered
himself
then
came
the
play
of
fists
ackroyd
from
the
first
had
far
the
best
of
it
but
the
other
managed
to
hold
his
ground
and
the
result
of
it
was
that
in
something
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
from
his
leaving
the
ackroyd
found
himself
on
the
way
to
the
his
adversary
following
in
the
care
of
a
second
constable
all
the
way
loudly
accusing
him
of
being
the
assailant
totty
walked
in
the
rear
of
the
crowd
she
had
been
frightened
by
the
scene
of
violence
and
there
were
marks
of
tears
on
her
cheeks
she
entered
the
station
eager
to
get
a
hearing
for
a
plain
story
ackroyd
turned
and
saw
her
no
good
saying
anything
now
he
said
to
her
blackguard
has
plenty
more
lies
ready
go
to
the
house
and
tell
my
will
you
i
dare
say
he
come
and
be
bail
she
went
at
once
and
ran
all
the
way
to
paradise
street
so
that
when
in
reply
to
her
knock
poole
appeared
at
the
door
she
had
to
wait
yet
a
moment
before
her
breath
would
suffice
for
speaking
she
did
not
know
poole
got
a
message
from
ackroyd
for
poole
she
said
the
other
was
alarmed
happened
now
she
inquired
poole
sister
totty
lowered
her
voice
and
explained
rapidly
what
had
come
to
pass
poole
eyed
her
throughout
with
something
more
than
suspicion
who
may
you
be
if
you
please
she
asked
at
the
end
miss
nancarrow
not
much
wiser
thank
you
i
let
poole
know
she
closed
the
door
totty
thus
unceremoniously
shut
out
turned
away
she
felt
miserable
and
the
feeling
was
so
strange
to
her
that
before
she
had
gone
many
steps
she
again
began
to
cry
she
had
understood
well
enough
the
thought
expressed
in
poole
face
it
was
gratuitous
unkindness
and
just
now
she
was
not
prepared
for
it
there
was
much
of
the
child
in
her
still
for
all
her
years
of
independence
in
the
highways
and
of
lambeth
and
finding
it
needful
to
cry
she
let
her
tears
have
free
course
only
now
and
then
dashing
the
back
of
her
hand
against
the
corner
of
her
lips
as
she
walked
on
why
should
the
woman
be
so
ready
to
think
evil
of
her
she
had
done
nothing
whatever
to
deserve
it
nothing
she
had
kept
herself
a
good
girl
for
all
that
she
lived
alone
and
liked
to
laugh
at
another
time
most
likely
she
would
have
cared
something
less
than
a
straw
for
poole
opinion
of
her
but
just
now
somehow
well
she
did
know
quite
how
it
was
why
would
luke
keep
on
drinking
in
that
way
and
oblige
her
to
run
out
of
the
it
was
his
fault
the
foolish
fellow
but
he
had
been
quick
enough
to
defend
her
a
girl
would
not
find
it
amiss
to
have
that
arm
always
at
her
service
and
in
the
meantime
he
was
in
the
police
cell
poole
excessively
annoyed
went
down
to
the
kitchen
her
husband
sat
in
front
of
the
fire
a
long
clay
pipe
at
his
lips
his
feet
very
wide
apart
on
the
fender
up
on
the
high
mantelpiece
stood
a
half
finished
glass
of
beer
though
he
still
held
the
pipe
he
was
nodding
as
his
wife
entered
his
head
fell
very
low
exclaimed
his
wife
as
if
something
had
been
added
to
her
annoyance
well
jane
eh
you
set
your
great
feet
on
the
fender
the
minute
i
turn
my
back
of

take
your
boots

must
keep
your
heels
under
the
chair
i
wo
have
my
fender
scratched
so
i
tell
you
he
was
a
man
sleepy
in
appearance
at
the
best
of
times
but
enormously
he
bent
down
in
a
startled
way
to
see
if
his
boots
had
really
done
any
harm
well
i
wo
do
it
again

mumbled

ever
so
slight
an
appearance
against
another
of
her
sex
we
admire
this
stalwart
virtue
you
and
i
reverencing
public
opinion
all
the
same
charity
has
something
to
be
said
for
it
nancarrow
eh
said
poole
dragging
on
his
big
overcoat
know
her
kennington
road
station
is
it
better
finish
your
beer
jim
i
will
have
a
bit
o
supper
ready
for
the
lad
totty
walked
as
far
as
the
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
enter
and
make
inquiries
that
look
of
poole
would
be
hard
to
bear
from
men
her
tears
were
dry
now
she
stood
reading
the
notices
on
the
board
a
man
had
deserted
his
wife
and
left
her
chargeable
to
the
parish
there
was
a
reward
for
his
apprehension
the
fault
totty
said
to
herself
made
his
home
miserable
for
him
if
i
had
a
husband
i
do
think
he
want
to
run
away
from
if
he
did
well
i
should
say
riddance
catch
me
setting
the
after
him
the
body
of
a
child
had
been
found
a
woman
answering
to
a
certain
description
was
wanted
thing
thought
totty
more
likely
to
pity
than
to
blame
they
should
take
her
if
i
could
help
it
so
she
commented
on
each
notice
in
accordance
with
her
mood
it
was
very
cold
she
had
no
gloves
on
and
her
hands
were
getting
quite
numb
would
poole
answer
the
summons
if
not
luke
would
she
supposed
remain
in
the
cell
all
night
it
would
be
cold
enough
poor
fellow
she
had
waited
about
twenty
minutes
when
a
man
in
a
big
overcoat
came
up
and
after
eyeing
the
edifice
from
roof
to
pavement
ascended
the
steps
and
entered
should
wonder
if
that
him
murmured
totty
and
she
waited
anxiously
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
man
appeared
again
and
after
him
came
oh
yes
it
was
luke
he
had
his
eyes
on
the
ground
the
rescuer
put
his
arm
in
luke
and
they
walked
off
together
he
had
not
seen
her
and
she
was
disappointed
she
followed
at
a
short
distance
behind
them
the
man
spoke
occasionally
but
ackroyd
seemed
to
make
brief
reply
if
any
their
way
took
them
along
walnut
tree
walk
totty
saw
that
in
passing
the
house
where
lydia
and
thyrza
lived
luke
cast
a
glance
at
the
upper
windows
probably
he
knew
nothing
of
thyrza
absence
at
eastbourne
they
turned
into
lambeth
walk
then
again
into
paradise
street
totty
still
a
little
distance
in
the
rear
at
their
house
they
paused
luke
seemed
to
be
going
further
on
and
to
the
girl
surprise
he
did
so
whilst
poole
entered
he
turned
to
the
left
this
time
into
newport
street
totty
felt
a
strange
tightness
at
her
chest
for
all
at
once
she
guessed
what
his
purpose
was
it
was
still
only
ten
people
were
moving
about
newport
street
has
only
one
inhabited
side
the
other
is
formed
by
the
railway
viaduct
the
arches
of
which
are
boarded
up
and
made
to
serve
for
stables
warehouses
workshops
moreover
the
thoroughfare
is
very
badly
lighted
on
the
railway
side
one
can
walk
along
at
without
risk
of
recognition
totty
availed
herself
of
this
gloom
and
kept
nearly
opposite
to
luke
he
stopped
before
her
house
hesitated
was
about
to
approach
the
door
then
totty
no
stranger
being
near
called
softly
across
the
street
ackroyd
he
turned
at
once
and
came
over
is
that
you
he
said
are
you
doing
there
totty
nothing
so
they
let
you
go
she
spoke
indifferently
it
had
been
on
her
tongue
to
say
that
she
had
followed
from
the
but
the
other
words
came
instead
shall
have
to
turn
up
on
monday
morning
luke
replied
a
shame
did
they
keep
that
man
they
kept
us
both
he
kept
swearing
i
an
old
grudge
against
him
and
that
he
done
nothing
at
all
the
blackguard
had
the
impudence
to
charge
me
with
assault
so
i
charged
him
too
then
that
constable
said
he
had
us
both
in
charge
before
for
drunk
and
disorderly
altogether
it
was
a
bad
do
you
run
the
chance
of
getting
into
such
rows
i
like
that
totty
was
i
to
let
him
insult
you
and
just
stand
by
i
do
mean
that
but
it
would
have
happened
at
all
but
for
you
going
on
drinking
you
know
that
very
well
mr
ackroyd
suppose
it
would
it
does
matter
i
just
wanted
to
see
got
home
all
right
mind
get
home
safe
that
all
she
turned
away
he
turned
away
but
he
was
back
before
she
had
crossed
the
street
say
totty
is
it
have
told
me
what
you
were
doing
standing
here
do
see
as
it
matters
to
you
mr
ackroyd
i
suppose
it
does
well
each
again
turned
to
depart
again
ackroyd
came
hack
it
mr
ackroyd
she
exclaimed
fretfully
ca
for
the
life
of
me
make
out
what
you
were
doing
standing
there
do
see
as
it
any
business
of
yours
mr
ackroyd
i
rather
you
told
me
i
suppose
you
were
waiting
for
somebody
you
know
yes
i
was
i
thought
so
well
i
wo
stop
to
be
in
the
way

mr
ackroyd

station

man

deserted
his
wife
there
how

another
thing
it
was
no
use
you
looking
up
at
thyrza
window
she
away
do
you
know
i
looked
up
he
came
nearer
a
smile
on
his
face
totty
averted
her
eyes
suppose
it
was
me
you
were
waiting
for
totty
she
said
nothing
me
a
kiss
totty
sure
i
sha
mr
ackroyd
let
me
take
one
she
made
no
resistance
totty
he
whispered
drawing
her
near
christmas
if
you
have
taken
a
drop
too
much
before
then
if
i
find
out
you
it
no
good
you
coming
after
totty
nancarrow
she
walked
with
him
to
the
end
of
the
street
then
watched
him
to
his
house
she
was
pleased
she
was
ashamed
she
was
afraid
turning
to
go
home
she
crossed
herself
and
murmured
something
chapter
xviii
drawing
nearer
lydia
had
a
little
rule
of
which
deserved
to
be
and
was
its
own
reward
if
ever
personal
troubles
began
to
worry
her
she
diligently
bent
her
thoughts
upon
someone
for
whose
welfare
she
was
anxious
and
whom
she
might
possibly
aid
the
rule
had
to
submit
to
an
emphatic
exception
the
person
to
be
thought
of
must
be
any
one
that
particular
one
whose
welfare
she
especially
desired
and
whom
she
might
perchance
have
aided
if
she
had
made
a
great
endeavour
however
the
rule
itself
had
become
established
long
before
this
exception
was
dreamt
of
formerly
she
was
wont
to
occupy
her
mind
with
thyrza
now
that
her
sister
seemed
all
but
beyond
need
of
anxious
guarding
and
that
the
necessity
for
applying
the
rule
was
greater
than
ever
before
lydia
gave
her
attention
to
boddy
the
old
man
had
not
borne
the
winter
very
well
looking
at
him
lydia
could
not
help
observing
that
he
stooped
more
than
was
his
habit
and
that
his
face
was
more
drawn
he
did
his
best
to
put
a
bright
aspect
on
things
when
he
talked
with
her
but
there
were
signs
that
he
found
it
increasingly
difficult
to
obtain
sufficient
work
a
few
months
ago
she
would
have
had
no
scruple
in
speaking
freely
on
the
subject
to
mary
bower
or
even
to
bower
and
so
learning
from
them
whether
the
old
man
paid
his
rent
regularly
and
had
enough
food
but
from
mary
she
was
estranged
it
seemed
as
if
hopelessly
and
bower
had
of
late
been
anything
but
cordial
when
lydia
went
to
the
shop
the
girl
observed
that
boddy
was
now
never
to
be
found
seated
in
the
back
parlour
she
always
had
to
go
up
to
his
room
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
mention
this
to
him
or
indeed
to
say
anything
that
would
suggest
her
coolness
with
the
bowers
still
it
was
all
tacitly
understood
and
it
made
things
very
uncomfortable
she
was
still
angry
with
mary
every
night
she
chid
herself
for
doing
what
she
had
never
done
before
for
nourishing
unkindness
she
shed
many
tears
in
secret
but
forgiveness
would
not
grow
in
her
heart
she
thought
not
seldom
of
the
precepts
she
had
heard
at
chapel
and
curiously
they
by
degrees
separated
themselves
from
her
individual
resentment
much
she
desired
to
make
them
her
laws
for
they
seemed
beautiful
to
her
conscience
could
she
but
receive
that
christian
spirit
it
would
be
easy
to
go
to
mary
and
say
have
been
wrong
forgive
me
the
day
was
not
yet
come
so
she
had
to
turn
over
plans
for
helping
the
poor
old
man
who
long
ago
had
so
helped
her
and
thyrza
of
course
she
thought
of
the
possibility
of
his
coming
to
live
in
thyrza
house
yet
how
propose
that
thyrza
had
so
much
to
occupy
her
it
was
not
wonderful
that
she
took
for
granted
boddy
and
would
it
be
justifiable
to
impose
a
burden
of
this
kind
upon
the
pair
to
be
sure
she
could
earn
enough
to
pay
for
the
little
that
boddy
needed
thyrza
had
almost
angrily
rejected
the
idea
that
her
sister
should
pay
rent
in
the
new
house
payment
for
board
she
would
only
accept
because
lydia
declared
that
if
it
were
not
accepted
she
would
live
elsewhere
so
there
would
remain
a
margin
for
the
old
man
needs
but
his
presence
in
the
house
was
the
difficulty
it
might
be
very
inconvenient
and
in
any
ease
such
a
proposal
ought
to
come
from
gilbert
first
of
all
the
old
man
moreover
was
very
sensitive
on
the
point
involved
such
a
change
would
have
to
be
brought
about
with
every
delicacy
still
it
must
come
to
that
before
long
perhaps
the
best
would
be
to
wait
until
thyrza
was
actually
married
and
discover
how
the
household
arrangements
worked
thyrza
herself
would
then
perhaps
notice
the
old
man
failing
strength
lydia
went
to
see
him
on
sunday
afternoon
the
bright
day
suggested
to
her
that
she
should
take
him
out
for
a
walk
she
had
waited
until
mary
would
be
away
at
the
school
bower
lay
on
the
sofa
snoring
the
of
roast
beef
and
cabbage
was
heavy
in
the
air
of
the
room
bower
would
have
also
slept
but
for
the
necessity
of
having
an
eye
to
the
shop
which
was
open
on
sunday
as
on
other
days
her
drowsiness
made
her
irritable
and
she
only
muttered
as
lydia
went
through
to
the
staircase
lydia
had
come
this
way
for
the
sake
of
appearances
she
resolved
that
on
the
next
occasion
she
would
ring
boddy
bell
at
the
side
door
upstairs
the
old
man
was
reading
his
thumbed
bible
he
never
went
to
a
place
of
worship
but
read
the
bible
on
sunday
without
fail
he
was
delighted
to
go
out
into
the
sunshine
when
did
the
little
one
get
back
he
asked
as
he
drew
out
his
overcoat
the
christmas
gift
from
a
drawer
in
which
it
was
carefully
folded
what
do
you
think
she
wo
be
back
till
tomorrow
yesterday
when
i
got
back
from
work
there
was
a
telegraph
waiting
for
me
it
was
from
the
lady
at
eastbourne
ormonde
and
just
said
she
was
going
to
keep
thyrza
till
monday
because
it
would
do
her
good
how
she
will
be
enjoying
herself
they
left
the
house
by
the
private
door
and
went
in
the
direction
of
the
river
lydia
ordinarily
walked
at
a
good
pace
now
she
accommodated
her
steps
to
those
of
her
companion
her
tall
shapely
figure
made
that
of
the
old
man
look
very
decrepit
when
he
had
anything
of
importance
to
say
boddy
came
to
a
stand
and
lydia
would
bend
a
little
forward
listening
to
him
so
attentively
that
she
was
quite
unaware
of
the
glances
of
those
who
passed
by
so
they
got
to
the
foot
of
lambeth
bridge
must
go
too
far
lydia
said
you
be
tired
grandad
suppose
we
walk
a
little
way
along
the
embankment
it
too
cold
afraid
to
sit
down
but
is
it
nice
to
have
sunshine
how
that
child
must
be
enjoying
herself
to
be
sure
she
was
almost
crazy
yesterday
morning
before
she
got
off
i
certain
she
did
sleep
not
two
hours
in
the
night
it
very
kind
of
that
lady
to
keep
her
is
it
but
everybody
is
kind
to
thyrza
they
ca
help
being
more
they
can
lyddy
no
more
they
can
but
there
somebody
else
as
i
want
to
see
enjoying
herself
a
little
when
your
turn
come
for
a
bit
of
a
holiday
my
dear
you
work
year
in
year
out
and
you
so
quiet
over
it
any
one
forget
as
you
wanted
a
rest
just
like
other
people
shall
see
grandad
wait
till
the
summer
comes
and
thyrza
well
settled
down
and
then
who
knows
but
you
and
me
may
run
away
together
for
a
day
at
the
seaside
i
going
to
be
rich
because
they
wo
let
me
pay
anything
for
my
room
we
keep
that
as
a
secret
to
ourselves
well
said
the
old
man
chuckling
from
sheer
pleasure
in
her
affection
no
knowin
i
like
to
go
to
the
seaside
once
more
and
i
rather
you
was
with
me
than
any
one
else
we
always
find
something
to
talk
about
i
think
lyddy
and
with
everybody
i
care
to
talk
nowadays
it
hard
to
find
people
as
has
the
same
thoughts
but
you
and
me
we
remember
together
do
we
lyddy
now
do
remember
one
night
as
there
come
a
soldier
into
the
shop
a
soldier
as
wanted
to
buy
lydia
exclaimed
know
i
remember
and
when
he
paid
for
it
he
took
up
his
stick
smashed
the
glass
right
in
the
middle
then
walked
off
with
it
under
his
arm
what
years
it
must
be
since
i
thought
of
that
grandad
and
i
ran
away
frightened
was
frightened
myself
too
and
we
never
could
understand
it
last
night
when
i
was
lying
awake
that
soldier
came
back
to
me
and
i
laughed
so
and
i
thought
i
ask
lyddy
if
she
remembers
that
they
both
laughed
then
pursued
their
walk
look
said
boddy
presently
ackroyd
along
lydia
had
already
seen
him
that
was
why
she
had
become
silent
not
going
to
stop
are
you
grandad
she
asked
under
her
breath
no
my
dear
not
if
you
do
wish
rather
not
ackroyd
was
walking
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
looking
carelessly
about
him
he
recognised
the
two
at
a
little
distance
and
drew
one
hand
forth
till
he
got
quite
near
he
affected
not
to
have
seen
them
then
without
a
smile
he
raised
his
hat
and
walked
past
his
pace
accelerated
lydia
also
with
indifferent
face
just
bent
to
the
greeting
boddy
had
given
a
friendly
nod
there
was
silence
between
the
companions
then
lydia
said
thought
it
better
grandad
not
to
not
to
be
quite
the
same
with
ackroyd
as
i
used
to
be
yes
lyddy
i
understand
there
a
deal
of
talk
about
him
sorry
he
done
me
more
than
one
good
turn
and
i
hope
he
get
straight
again
yet
i
afraid
my
dear
as
you
know
the
disappointment
lydia
interrupted
with
firmness
no
excuse
at
all
not
a
bit
if
he
really
felt
the
disappointment
so
much
he
ought
to
have
borne
it
like
a
man
other
people
have
as
much
to
bear
i
never
thought
he
was
a
man
of
that
kind
never
we
wo
say
anything
more
about
him
their
conversation
so
lightened
the
way
that
they
reached
westminster
bridge
and
returned
by
the
road
which
runs
along
the
rear
of
the
hospital
wo
come
in
lyddy
said
the
old
man
when
they
were
near
the
shop
again
grandad
i
going
to
tea
with
grail
and
gilbert
because
thyrza
away
he
acquiesced
trying
to
conceal
the
sadness
he
felt
lydia
kissed
his
cheek
and
left
him
all
through
tea
in
the
grails
parlour
the
talk
was
of
thyrza
how
was
she
passing
her
time
was
it
as
fine
at
eastbourne
as
here
in
london
what
sort
of
a
lady
was
ormonde
and
when
the
three
drew
chairs
about
the
fire
gilbert
had
something
of
moment
to
communicate
something
upon
which
he
had
resolved
since
thyrza
departure
he
began
and
i
think
thyrza
had
better
not
go
to
work
again
as
she
is
going
to
miss
morning
it
be
a
good
opportunity
for
making
the
change
is
it
better
lydia
did
not
reply
at
once
such
a
decided
step
as
this
reminded
her
how
near
the
day
was
when
though
they
would
still
be
near
to
each
other
thyrza
and
she
must
in
a
sense
part
the
thought
was
always
a
heavy
one
she
did
not
willingly
entertain
it
you
think
she
asked
at
length
thyrza
will
feel
she
ought
to
stay
at
home
think
she
will
when
i
spoken
to
her
about
it
we
want
you
both
to
have
your
meals
with
us
thyrza
can
help
mother
and
she
have
more
time
for
her
reading
of
course
you
must
be
just
as
much
together
as
you
like
but
it
would
be
pleasant
if
you
would
come
down
here
to
meals
will
you
do
us
that
kindness
lyddy
lydia
began
doubtfully
grail
interrupted
her
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
my
dear
it
is
nice
of
you
lyddy
if
you
spoil
this
little
plan
we
made
just
for
the
next
three
weeks
after
that
you
can
be
as
independent
as
you
please
yes
my
dear
just
as
proud
as
you
please
there
a
great
deal
of
pride
in
you
you
know
and
i
do
like
you
the
worse
for
it
do
think
i
proud
at
all
said
lydia
smiling
and
reddening
a
little
thyrza
agrees
then
i
will
though
i
now
that
all
we
want
interposed
the
old
lady
very
good
of
you
by
the
first
post
in
the
morning
arrived
a
letter
addressed
to
trent
bearing
the
eastbourne
lydia
for
a
moment
had
a
great
fear
but
when
she
had
torn
the
envelope
open
the
first
lines
put
her
at
rest
it
was
ormonde
who
wrote
and
in
words
which
made
lydia
feel
very
happy
with
the
exception
of
a
line
once
or
twice
from
mary
bower
she
had
never
received
a
letter
in
her
life
she
was
very
proud
of
the
honour
gilbert
had
just
come
home
for
breakfast
and
all
rejoiced
over
the
news
of
thyrza
it
was
hard
for
lydia
to
sit
through
her
morning
at
the
workroom
thyrza
was
to
be
at
home
by
twelve
as
soon
as
the
struck
lydia
flung
her
work
aside
and
was
in
walnut
tree
walk
in
less
time
than
it
had
ever
before
taken
her
instinct
told
her
that
the
child
would
be
waiting
upstairs
alone
and
not
in
the
grails
room
she
flew
up
thyrza
rose
from
a
chair
and
met
her
not
however
with
the
outburst
of
childish
rapture
which
lydia
had
anticipated
their
parts
were
reversed
when
the
elder
sister
sprang
forward
breathless
with
her
haste
unable
to
utter
anything
but
broken
terms
of
endearment
thyrza
folded
her
in
her
arms
and
without
a
spoken
word
kissed
her
with
grave
tenderness
her
cheeks
had
the
most
unwonted
colour
her
eyes
gleamed
and
as
lydia
caresses
continued
glistened
with
moisture
lyddy
she
murmured
a
tear
formed
upon
her
eyelashes
and
her
voice
made
trembled
music
sister
you
glad
to
see
me
again
seems
an
age
my
own
darling
you
ca
think
what
sunday
was
like
to
me
without
you
and
how
well
you
look
my
beautiful
see
what
a
letter
i
had
from
ormonde
do
tell
me
what
she
like
how
did
she
come
to
ask
you
if
you
stay
to
think
of
you
saying
i
should
be
cross
with
her
but
of
course
that
was
only
fun
my
dear
one
and
what
the
sea
like
were
you
on
the
shore
again
this
morning
many
questions
does
that
make
i
wonder
lyddy
thyrza
said
with
a
smile
still
much
graver
than
of
wont
sha
tell
you
anything
till
you
had
dinner
it
all
ready
for
you
downstairs
know
what
they
want
us
to
do
i
talked
it
all
over
with
grail
i
do
think
we
ought
to
refuse
lyddy
and
so
i
not
to
go
to
work
any
more
i
wish
it
was
the
same
for
you
dear
shall
you
find
it
very
hard
to
go
alone
not
i
why
whatever
should
i
do
with
myself
if
i
stayed
at
home
it
different
with
you
you
must
learn
all
you
can
so
as
to
be
able
to
talk
to
gilbert
to
dinner
lydia
paused
at
the
door
has
come
to
you
thyrza
she
asked
looking
in
her
face
not
the
same
somehow
oh
how
you
manage
to
do
your
own
hair
but
there
something
different
in
you
there
yes
perhaps
oh
we
a
deal
to
talk
about
lyddy
gilbert
want
you
that
must
be
and
so
it
was
when
all
had
sat
together
for
an
hour
at
gilbert
late
meal
the
sisters
went
up
to
their
room
gilbert
understood
this
perfectly
well
the
next
evening
would
be
his
when
it
came
grail
made
an
excuse
to
go
and
sit
with
lydia
thyrza
had
her
gilbert
was
at
a
little
distance
the
privileges
he
asked
were
very
few
sometimes
when
thyrza
and
he
were
alone
he
would
bold
her
hand
for
a
minute
and
at
parting
he
kissed
her
but
more
of
acted
tenderness
than
that
he
did
not
allow
himself
whilst
she
was
speaking
he
gazed
at
her
continuously
he
too
observed
the
change
of
which
lydia
had
at
once
become
aware
thyrza
seemed
to
have
grown
older
in
those
two
days
her
very
way
of
sitting
was
marked
by
a
maturer
dignity
and
in
her
speech
it
was
impossible
not
to
be
struck
with
the
the
thoughtful
choice
of
words
which
had
taken
the
place
of
her
former
impulsiveness
she
dwelt
much
upon
the
delight
she
had
received
from
miss
playing
that
had
clearly
made
a
great
impression
upon
her
was
something
she
played
gilbert
that
told
just
what
i
felt
when
i
first
saw
the
sea
do
you
know
what
i
mean
does
music
ever
seem
to
speak
to
you
in
that
way
it
really
as
if
it
spoke
words
understand
you
very
well
thyrza
he
answered
in
a
subdued
voice
and
he
added
his
eyes
brightening
i
take
you
some
night
to
a
concert
a
really
good
concert
at
one
of
the
large
halls
you
i
will
i
find
out
from
the
newspaper
and
we
go
together
she
looked
at
him
gratefully
but
did
not
speak
as
she
remained
silent
he
drew
his
chair
nearer
and
held
his
hand
for
hers
she
gave
it
without
meeting
his
look
i
heard
from
egremont
this
morning
he
wants
to
know
if
i
can
be
ready
to
begin
at
the
library
on
may
that
a
monday
it
wo
be
opened
then
but
we
shall
be
able
to
begin
arranging
the
books
the
house
will
be
ready
before
the
end
of
this
month
will
you
come
and
be
married
to
me
three
weeks
from
gilbert
i
will
no
flush
but
an
extreme
pallor
came
upon
her
face
he
felt
a
coldness
in
her
hand
we
shall
go
for
a
week
to
the
seaside
again
he
continued
his
voice
uncertain
be
back
in
time
to
get
our
house
in
order
before
the
of
may
gilbert
she
still
did
not
look
at
him
he
released
her
hand
and
went
on
in
a
more
natural
tone
had
a
letter
from
my
brother
this
morning
as
well
he
have
to
come
to
london
on
business
in
about
a
month
he
says
so
i
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
have
him
stay
with
us
hope
so
she
spoke
mechanically
and
then
followed
a
rather
long
silence
both
were
lost
in
thought
nor
did
the
conversation
renew
itself
after
this
for
thyrza
seemed
to
have
no
more
to
tell
of
her
eastbourne
experiences
and
gilbert
found
it
enough
to
sit
near
her
at
times
searching
her
face
for
the
meaning
which
was
in
it
she
rose
at
length
and
when
they
had
exchanged
a
few
words
with
regard
to
her
occupations
now
that
she
would
remain
at
home
thyrza
approached
him
to
say
instead
of
bending
to
kiss
her
at
once
he
held
her
hand
in
both
his
and
said
look
at
me
she
did
so
his
hands
were
trembling
and
his
features
worked
nervously
have
never
said
you
love
me
he
continued
just
above
a
whisper
you
say
that
now
for
an
instant
she
looked
down
then
raised
her
eyes
again
and
breathed
love
you
gilbert
do
think
words
were
ever
spoken
that
sounded
sweeter
than
those
she
spoke
again
with
an
earnestness
unlike
anything
he
had
ever
seen
in
her
quite
different
from
that
which
had
inspired
similar
words
when
first
she
pledged
herself
to
him
i
will
try
with
all
my
strength
to
be
a
good
wife
to
you
i
will
i
hope
thyrza
that
the
day
when
i
fail
in
perfect
love
and
kindness
to
you
may
be
the
last
of
my
life
she
raised
her
face
for
the
first
time
he
put
his
arms
about
her
and
kissed
her
passionately
grail
said
and
went
downstairs
as
soon
as
thyrza
appeared
thyrza
seated
herself
and
pressed
a
hand
against
her
side
her
heart
beat
painfully
there
lydia
exclaimed
of
a
sudden
left
the
photographs
photographs
thyrza
asked
lydia
took
from
the
table
an
envelope
which
contained
some
dozen
they
were
all
the
portraits
which
grail
and
her
son
possessed
and
the
old
lady
was
very
fond
of
looking
over
them
and
gossiping
about
them
she
had
brought
them
up
because
she
anticipated
an
evening
of
especial
intimacy
with
lydia
thyrza
held
out
her
hand
for
them
she
knew
them
all
including
the
latest
addition
which
was
a
photograph
of
walter
egremont
egremont
had
given
it
to
grail
about
three
weeks
ago
it
was
two
years
old
she
turned
them
out
upon
her
lap
think
i
better
take
them
down
now
had
i
said
lydia
would
trouble
till
morning
thyrza
answered
in
a
tired
voice
two
lay
exposed
before
her
that
of
gilbert
taken
six
years
ago
and
that
of
egremont
lydia
looking
over
her
shoulder
remarked
a
boy
egremont
looks
compared
with
gilbert
thyrza
said
nothing
dear
put
them
in
the
envelope
and
let
me
take
them
down
never
mind
till
morning
lyddy
the
voice
was
rather
impatient
i
afraid
grail
remember
and
have
the
trouble
of
coming
up
wo
think
it
worth
while
and
i
want
to
look
at
them
very
well
dear
the
two
unlike
faces
continued
to
lie
uppermost
chapter
xix
a
song
without
words
whilst
the
repairs
were
going
on
in
the
house
behind
the
school
the
old
caretaker
still
lived
there
egremont
found
that
she
had
in
truth
nowhere
else
to
go
and
as
it
was
desirable
that
someone
should
remain
upon
the
premises
he
engaged
her
to
do
so
until
the
grails
entered
into
possession
as
soon
as
painters
plasterers
and
paperhangers
were
out
of
the
way
grail
and
thyrza
went
to
the
house
to
decide
what
furniture
it
would
be
necessary
to
buy
the
outlay
was
to
be
as
little
as
possible
for
indeed
there
was
but
little
money
to
spend
butterfield
that
was
the
old
woman
name
admitted
them
but
without
speaking
when
gilbert
made
some
remark
about
its
being
disagreeable
for
her
to
live
in
such
a
strong
odour
of
paint
she
muttered
inarticulately
and
withdrew
into
the
kitchen
thyrza
presently
peeped
into
that
room
the
old
woman
was
sitting
on
a
low
stool
by
the
fire
her
knees
up
to
her
chin
her
grizzled
hair
unkempt
she
looked
so
remarkably
like
a
witch
and
on
thyrza
appearance
turned
with
a
gaze
of
such
extreme
malignity
that
the
girl
drew
back
in
fear
suppose
she
takes
it
ill
that
the
old
state
of
things
has
been
disturbed
gilbert
said
egremont
tells
me
he
has
found
that
she
is
to
have
a
small
weekly
allowance
from
the
chapel
people
so
i
suppose
she
fall
into
want
and
we
know
he
would
send
her
off
to
starve
that
is
his
way
the
removal
of
such
things
as
were
to
be
brought
from
walnut
tree
walk
and
the
housing
of
the
new
furniture
would
take
only
a
couple
of
days
this
was
to
be
done
immediately
before
the
wedding
then
lydia
and
grail
would
live
in
the
house
whilst
the
husband
and
wife
were
away
egremont
found
that
the
large
would
be
ready
sooner
than
he
had
anticipated
when
it
was
cleaned
out
there
was
nothing
to
do
save
to
fix
shelves
a
small
counter
and
two
long
tables
for
some
time
he
had
been
making
extensive
purchases
of
books
for
the
most
part
from
a
secondhand
dealer
who
warehoused
his
volumes
for
him
till
the
library
should
be
prepared
to
receive
them
he
had
drawn
up
too
a
skeleton
catalogue
but
this
could
not
be
proceeded
with
before
the
books
were
in
some
sort
of
order
upon
the
shelves
he
was
nervously
impatient
to
reach
this
stage
since
his
last
visit
to
eastbourne
he
had
seen
no
friends
in
civilised
london
and
now
that
he
had
no
longer
lectures
to
write
his
state
of
mind
grew
ever
more
unsatisfactory
loneliness
though
to
so
great
an
extent
weighed
upon
him
intolerably
he
believed
that
he
was
going
through
the
dreariest
time
of
his
life
how
often
he
thought
with
envy
of
the
little
parlour
in
walnut
tree
walk
to
toil
oneself
weary
through
a
long
day
in
a
candle
factory
and
then
come
back
to
the
evening
meal
with
the
certainty
that
a
sweet
young
face
would
be
there
to
meet
one
with
its
smile
sweet
lips
to
give
affectionate
welcome
that
would
be
better
than
this
life
which
he
led
he
wished
to
go
there
again
but
feared
to
do
so
without
invitation
the
memory
of
his
evening
there
made
distasteful
to
him
he
had
a
letter
from
ormonde
in
which
a
brief
mention
was
made
of
thyrza
visit
he
replied
do
you
not
tell
me
more
of
the
impression
made
upon
you
by
miss
trent
it
was
a
favourable
one
of
course
as
you
kept
her
with
you
over
the
sunday
you
do
not
mention
whether
annabel
saw
her
she
is
very
fond
of
music
it
would
have
been
a
kindness
to
ask
annabel
to
play
to
her
but
i
have
miss
newthorpe
promise
that
she
and
her
father
will
come
and
see
the
library
as
soon
as
it
is
open
then
at
all
events
they
will
make
the
acquaintance
of
grail
interests
me
very
much
as
you
gather
from
my
way
of
writing
about
her
i
hope
she
will
come
to
think
of
me
as
a
friend
it
will
be
delightful
to
watch
her
mind
grow
i
am
sure
she
has
faculties
of
a
very
delicate
kind
i
believe
she
will
soon
be
able
to
appreciate
literature
has
she
not
a
strange
personal
charm
and
is
it
not
impossible
to
think
of
her
becoming
anything
but
a
woman
you
too
now
that
you
know
her
will
continue
to
be
her
friend
i
earnestly
hope
so
if
she
could
be
for
a
little
time
with
you
now
and
then
how
it
would
help
to
develop
the
possibilities
that
are
in
her
to
the
letter
of
which
this
was
part
ormonde
quickly
responded
regard
to
miss
trent
she
said
beg
you
not
to
indulge
your
idealistic
habits
of
thought
immoderately
i
found
her
a
pretty
and
interesting
girl
and
it
is
not
unlikely
that
she
may
make
a
good
wife
for
such
a
man
as
grail
himself
clearly
quite
enough
of
an
idealist
to
dispense
with
the
more
solid
housewifely
virtues
in
his
but
i
add
this
walter
it
certainly
would
not
be
advisable
to
fill
her
head
too
suddenly
with
a
kind
of
thought
to
which
she
has
hitherto
been
a
stranger
if
i
had
influence
with
grail
i
should
hint
to
him
that
he
is
going
to
marry
a
very
young
wife
and
that
under
the
circumstances
the
balance
of
character
to
be
found
in
sober
domestic
occupation
will
for
some
time
be
what
she
most
needs
to
aim
at
you
see
i
am
an
idealist
and
i
think
commonplace
domestic
happiness
of
more
account
than
aspirations
which
might
not
improbably
endanger
it
forgive
me
for
these
remarks
which
you
will
say
have
a
slight
odour
of
the
kitchen
or
at
best
of
the
never
mind
both
are
places
without
which
the
study
could
not
exist
egremont
bit
his
lips
over
this
for
the
first
time
he
was
dissatisfied
with
ormonde
he
wondered
on
what
terms
she
had
received
thyrza
he
had
imagined
the
girl
as
treated
with
every
indulgence
at
the
chestnuts
but
the
tone
of
this
letter
made
him
fear
lest
ormonde
had
deemed
it
a
duty
to
refrain
from
too
much
kindness
it
was
very
unlike
her
what
had
she
observed
that
made
her
so
disagreeably
prudent
all
at
once
it
added
to
his
mental
malaise
what
change
was
befalling
his
life
was
he
about
to
find
himself
actually
sundered
from
the
friends
he
had
made
in
the
sphere
which
his
birth
gave
him
no
claim
to
enter
it
all
meant
that
he
was
reverting
to
the
condition
wherein
he
was
born
his
attempt
to
become
a
member
of
society
with
a
capital
was
proving
itself
a
failure
very
well
he
would
find
his
friends
in
the
working
world
when
he
needed
society
of
an
evening
he
would
find
it
with
gilbert
grail
and
his
wife
he
would
pursue
his
work
more
earnestly
than
ever
he
would
get
his
club
founded
as
soon
as
the
library
was
ready
for
a
he
would
seek
diligently
for
the
working
men
of
hopeful
character
and
by
force
of
sincerity
win
their
confidence
let
the
wealthy
and
refined
people
go
their
way
and
at
this
point
he
veritably
experienced
a
great
relief
for
two
days
he
went
about
almost
joyously
his
task
was
renewed
before
him
and
his
energy
at
the
same
time
had
taken
new
life
doubt
he
said
to
himself
was
once
more
vanquished
perchance
finally
then
came
another
letter
from
ormonde
asking
him
to
come
and
drink
the
air
of
these
delicious
spring
days
by
the
shore
he
replied
that
it
was
impossible
to
leave
london
that
very
day
he
had
despatched
seven
full
of
volumes
to
the
library
and
he
was
going
to
begin
the
work
of
setting
the
books
on
the
shelves
that
was
a
monday
a
week
remained
before
thyrza
thyrza
had
not
been
to
the
new
house
since
she
went
with
gilbert
to
see
about
the
furniture
her
curiosity
was
satisfied
her
interest
in
the
place
had
strangely
lessened
more
than
that
in
walking
by
herself
she
never
chose
that
direction
whereas
formerly
she
had
always
liked
to
do
so
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
some
reason
for
avoiding
sight
of
the
building
this
monday
her
mind
changed
again
she
frequently
went
to
meet
her
sister
at
the
and
having
set
forth
somewhat
too
early
she
went
round
by
way
of
brook
street
no
positive
desire
impelled
her
it
was
rather
as
if
her
feet
took
that
turning
independently
of
her
thoughts
on
drawing
near
to
the
library
she
was
surprised
to
see
a
van
standing
before
the
door
two
men
were
carrying
a
wooden
box
into
the
building
she
crossed
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
and
went
forwards
slowly
the
men
came
out
mounted
to
the
of
the
van
and
drove
away
that
must
be
a
delivery
of
books
who
was
there
to
receive
them
she
crossed
the
street
again
and
approached
the
library
door
she
walked
past
it
stopped
came
back
she
tried
the
handle
and
the
door
opened
there
was
no
harm
in
looking
in
amid
a
number
of
stood
egremont
his
head
was
uncovered
and
he
had
a
in
his
hand
as
if
about
to
open
the
chests
at
sight
of
thyrza
he
came
forward
with
a
look
of
delight
and
shook
hands
with
her
you
have
discovered
what
i
about
i
did
wish
anyone
to
know
you
see
the
shelves
are
all
ready
and
i
could
resist
the
temptation
of
having
books
brought
will
you
keep
the
secret
wo
say
a
word
sir
warmth
on
thyrza
cheeks
answered
the
pleasure
in
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
her
perhaps
neither
had
fully
felt
how
glad
it
would
make
them
to
meet
again
when
thyrza
had
given
her
assurance
face
showed
that
he
was
going
to
say
something
in
a
different
tone
trent
will
you
speak
to
me
in
future
as
you
do
to
your
friends
i
want
very
much
to
be
one
of
your
friends
if
you
will
let
me
thyrza
kept
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
she
could
not
find
the
fitting
words
for
reply
he
continued
is
my
friend
and
we
always
talk
as
friends
should
wo
you
cease
to
think
of
me
as
a
stranger
do
think
of
you
in
that
way
mr
egremont
let
us
shake
hands
again
in
the
new
way
thyrza
gave
hers
she
just
met
his
eyes
for
a
moment
her
own
had
a
smile
of
intense
happiness
keep
this
a
secret
egremont
went
on
quickly
resuming
his
ordinary
voice
surprise
grail
in
a
few
days
by
bringing
him
in
now
how
am
i
to
get
this
lid
off
how
tremendously
firm
it
is
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
got
the
men
to
do
it
but
i
brought
a
in
my
pocket
thinking
it
would
be
easy
enough
ah
there
a
beginning
i
ought
to
have
a
hammer
i
go
and
ask
butterfield
if
she
has
one
no
i
go
myself
run
it
wo
take
me
a
minute
she
went
out
by
the
door
that
led
into
the
house
in
the
dark
passage
she
was
startled
by
coming
in
contact
with
someone
who
is
that
a
muttered
reply
informed
her
that
it
was
the
old
woman
they
went
forward
into
the
nearest
room
there
was
a
disagreeable
smile
on
butterfield
thin
lips
you
please
have
you
got
a
hammer
thyrza
asked
egremont
wants
one
the
old
woman
went
apart
and
returned
with
a
hammer
which
was
used
for
breaking
coals
could
you
just
wipe
it
thyrza
said
handle
so
very
black
it
was
done
ungraciously
enough
and
thyrza
hastened
back
egremont
was
standing
as
she
had
left
him
now
i
can
manage
thank
you
with
absorbed
interest
thyrza
watched
the
process
saw
them
bringing
the
last
box
in
she
said
why
i
came
to
look
was
a
risk
i
foresaw
that
someone
would
notice
the
cart
but
perhaps
you
are
the
only
one
hope
so
as
you
do
want
any
one
to
know
she
paused
then
added
was
going
to
meet
lyddy
my
sister
i
do
go
to
work
myself
now
egremont
perhaps
gilbert
has
told
you
he
has
mentioned
it
but
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
do
much
like
my
sister
going
alone
but
she
does
really
mind
hope
i
shall
soon
know
your
sister
he
had
suspended
the
work
and
stood
with
one
foot
upon
the
case
thyrza
reflected
then
said
hope
you
will
like
her
mr
egremont
am
sure
i
shall
i
know
that
you
are
very
fond
of
your
sister
her
voice
faltered
a
little
could
have
gone
to
live
away
from
her
egremont
bent
to
his
task
again
and
speedily
raised
the
lid
there
was
a
covering
of
newspapers
and
then
the
books
were
revealed
he
said
shall
be
your
hand
that
puts
the
first
on
the
shelf
he
took
out
the
first
volume
of
a
copy
of
gibbon
and
walked
with
it
to
the
wall
shall
be
its
place
and
there
it
shall
always
stay
you
tell
me
what
the
book
is
about
mr
egremont
thyrza
asked
timidly
taking
it
from
him
should
like
to
remember
it
he
told
her
as
well
as
he
could
thyrza
stood
in
thought
for
a
moment
then
just
opened
the
pages
egremont
watched
her
wonder
whether
i
shall
ever
be
able
to
read
that
she
said
in
an
yes
i
sure
you
will
i
to
stand
it
here
there
you
shall
put
all
the
volumes
in
their
place
one
after
the
other
there
are
eight
of
them
he
brought
them
altogether
and
one
by
one
she
took
them
from
him
then
they
went
back
to
the
case
again
and
there
was
a
short
silence
going
to
take
me
to
a
concert
egremont
thyrza
said
looking
at
him
shyly
he
you
enjoy
that
what
concert
at
a
place
called
james
hall
yes
you
hear
admirable
music
never
been
to
a
concert
before
but
when
i
was
at
eastbourne
i
heard
a
lady
play
the
piano
i
enjoy
that
egremont
started
it
miss
newthorpe
he
asked
looking
at
her
without
a
smile
that
was
her
name
she
met
his
look
walter
half
turned
away
then
bent
down
to
the
books
again
know
her
he
said
plays
well
he
took
a
couple
of
volumes
and
went
with
them
to
the
shelves
where
he
placed
them
without
thought
next
to
the
gibbon
but
in
a
moment
he
noticed
the
title
and
moved
them
to
another
place
he
had
become
absent
thyrza
remaining
by
the
case
followed
his
movements
with
her
eyes
as
he
came
back
he
asked
you
like
mrs
ormonde
she
was
very
kind
to
me
to
him
it
seemed
an
inadequate
reply
and
strengthened
his
fear
that
ormonde
had
not
shown
all
the
warmth
he
would
have
desired
yet
as
it
proved
she
had
asked
annabel
to
play
for
thyrza
thyrza
too
felt
that
she
ought
to
say
more
but
all
at
once
she
found
a
difficulty
in
speaking
her
thoughts
had
strayed
think
i
must
go
now
she
said
i
shall
miss
my
sister
that
case
i
wo
delay
you
i
shall
open
one
or
two
more
of
these
boxes
then
go
somewhere
for
lunch
thyrza
said
rather
hurriedly
and
without
raising
her
face
it
happened
that
just
then
bower
was
coming
along
brook
street
he
did
not
usually
leave
the
works
at
but
an
exceptional
occasion
took
him
to
paradise
street
in
the
thyrza
came
forth
from
the
library
just
as
he
neared
the
corner
she
did
not
see
him
but
bower
at
once
observed
her
there
was
nothing
singular
in
her
having
been
there
possibly
the
furnishing
of
the
house
had
begun
in
passing
the
windows
of
the
future
library
bower
looked
up
at
them
with
curiosity
egremont
stood
there
gazing
into
the
street
he
recognised
bower
nodded
and
drew
back
bower
did
not
care
to
overtake
thyrza
he
avoided
her
by
crossing
the
street
she
in
the
meantime
was
not
going
straight
to
meet
her
sister
after
walking
slowly
for
a
little
distance
she
turned
in
a
direction
the
opposite
of
that
she
ought
to
have
taken
then
she
stopped
to
look
into
a
a
clock
showed
her
that
by
this
time
lydia
would
be
at
home
yet
still
she
walked
away
from
her
own
street
she
said
to
herself
that
minutes
must
pass
before
gilbert
would
leave
the
house
to
return
to
his
work
the
way
in
which
she
now
was
would
bring
her
by
a
long
compass
into
kennington
road
rain
threatened
and
she
had
no
umbrella
none
the
less
she
went
on
at
home
they
awaited
her
in
surprise
at
her
unpunctuality
grail
could
not
say
when
she
had
left
the
house
all
the
morning
thyrza
had
sat
upstairs
by
herself
just
when
gilbert
was
on
the
point
of
departure
the
missing
one
appeared
you
been
child
cried
lydia
it
begun
to
rain
you
all
wet
went
further
than
i
meant
to
thyrza
replied
throwing
off
her
hat
and
at
once
taking
a
seat
at
the
table
hope
you
did
wait
for
me
i
forgot
the
time
was
with
thinking
of
the
concert
said
gilbert
laughing
should
wonder
assented
lydia
thyrza
smiled
but
offered
no
further
excuse
gilbert
and
lydia
left
the
room
and
the
house
together
their
directions
were
opposite
but
gilbert
went
a
few
steps
lydia
way
want
you
to
alter
your
mind
and
go
with
us
he
said
really
it
is
worth
the
expense
gilbert
i
do
care
so
much
for
music
expense
is
only
a
shilling
and
thyrza
wo
be
quite
happy
without
you
i
want
her
to
enjoy
herself
without
reserve
come
but
right
be
ready
both
of
you
by
six
they
nodded
a
to
each
other
thyrza
was
making
believe
to
eat
her
dinner
grail
saw
what
a
pretence
it
was
there
ever
such
an
excitable
child
she
said
affectionately
do
eat
something
more
dear
i
shall
tell
gilbert
he
must
never
let
you
know
beforehand
when
he
going
to
take
you
anywhere
but
thyrza
had
no
appetite
she
helped
the
old
lady
to
clear
the
table
then
ran
upstairs
it
was
an
unspeakable
relief
to
be
alone
she
had
never
known
such
a
painful
feeling
of
guilt
as
whilst
she
sat
with
gilbert
and
lydia
regarding
her
yet
why
her
secret
she
tried
to
assure
herself
was
quite
innocent
trivial
indeed
but
why
had
she
been
unable
to
come
straight
home
what
had
held
her
away
as
forcibly
as
if
a
hand
had
lain
upon
her
she
moved
aimlessly
about
the
room
it
was
true
that
these
last
two
days
she
had
agitated
herself
with
anticipation
of
the
concert
but
it
was
something
quite
different
which
now
put
confusion
into
her
thought
and
every
now
and
then
actually
caught
her
breath
she
did
not
feel
well
she
wished
liddy
could
have
remained
at
home
with
her
this
afternoon
for
she
had
a
need
of
companionship
of
a
sort
of
help
there
was
grail
but
no
she
had
rather
not
be
with
grail
just
now
on
the
table
were
a
few
articles
of
clothing
which
lydia
and
she
had
made
during
the
last
fortnight
things
she
was
going
to
take
away
with
her
this
morning
she
had
given
them
a
few
finishing
touches
of
needlework
now
they
could
be
put
away
she
went
to
the
chest
of
drawers
of
the
two
small
drawers
at
the
top
one
was
hers
one
was
lydia
the
two
long
ones
below
were
divided
in
the
same
way
she
drew
one
out
and
turned
over
the
linen
how
some
young
lady
about
to
be
married
miss
paula
tyrrell
suppose
would
have
viewed
with
pitying
astonishment
the
outfit
with
which
thyrza
was
more
than
content
but
thyrza
had
never
viewed
marriage
as
an
opportunity
of
enriching
her
wardrobe
having
put
her
things
away
she
opened
another
drawer
and
looked
over
some
of
lydia
belongings
she
stroked
them
lightly
and
returned
each
carefully
to
its
place
saying
to
herself
wants
such
and
such
a
thing
she
have
more
money
to
spend
on
herself
soon
and
she
shall
have
a
really
nice
present
on
her
next
birthday
gilbert
give
me
money
to
buy
it
then
she
went
to
the
and
played
idly
with
a
little
ornament
that
stood
there
the
trouble
had
been
lighter
for
a
few
minutes
now
it
weighed
again
her
heart
beat
irregularly
she
leaned
her
elbows
on
the
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
there
was
a
strange
heat
in
her
blood
her
breath
was
hot
was
it
raining
still
no
the
pavement
had
dried
and
there
was
no
very
dark
cloud
in
the
sky
she
could
not
sit
here
all
through
the
afternoon
a
short
walk
would
perhaps
remove
the
headache
which
had
begun
to
trouble
her
she
descended
the
stairs
very
lightly
and
hastened
almost
on
along
the
passage
the
front
door
she
closed
as
softly
as
possible
behind
her
and
went
in
the
direction
away
from
grail
parlour
window
to
be
sure
she
was
free
to
leave
the
house
as
often
as
she
pleased
but
for
some
vague
reason
she
wished
just
now
not
to
be
observed
perhaps
gilbert
would
think
that
she
went
about
too
much
but
she
could
not
she
could
not
sit
in
the
room
without
express
purpose
she
again
walked
towards
brook
street
no
she
was
not
going
to
the
library
again
egremont
might
still
be
there
and
it
would
seem
so
strange
of
her
but
she
went
to
a
point
whence
she
could
see
the
building
and
for
some
minutes
stood
looking
at
it
was
he
still
within
egremont
those
books
would
take
him
a
long
time
to
put
on
the
shelves
as
she
looked
someone
came
out
from
the
door
egremont
himself
she
turned
and
almost
ran
in
her
desire
to
escape
his
notice
he
was
going
home
even
whilst
hurrying
she
tried
to
imagine
how
he
was
going
to
spend
his
evening
from
gilbert
description
she
had
made
a
picture
of
his
room
in
great
russell
street
did
he
sit
there
all
the
evening
among
his
books
reading
writing
not
always
of
course
he
was
a
gentleman
he
had
friends
to
go
and
see
people
who
lived
in
large
houses
very
grand
people
he
talked
with
ladies
with
such
as
miss
newthorpe
thyrza
did
not
trouble
to
notice
where
she
was
her
feet
hurried
her
on
her
head
throbbed
she
was
thinking
thinking
such
as
miss
newthorpe
yes
he
knew
that
lady
knew
her
very
well
as
was
evident
from
the
way
in
which
he
spoke
of
her
of
what
did
they
talk
when
they
met
no
doubt
she
had
often
played
to
him
and
when
she
played
he
would
look
at
her
and
she
was
very
beautiful
she
would
not
think
of
miss
newthorpe
somehow
she
did
not
feel
to
her
in
the
same
way
as
hitherto
when
she
was
married
she
would
of
course
see
him
very
often
egremont
he
would
be
at
the
library
constantly
no
doubt
perhaps
he
would
come
sometimes
and
sit
in
their
room
and
when
he
began
his
lectures
in
the
room
upstairs
would
it
not
be
possible
for
her
to
hear
him
she
would
so
like
to
just
once
she
could
at
all
events
creep
softly
up
and
listen
at
the
door
how
beautiful
his
lectures
must
be
gilbert
could
never
speak
strongly
enough
in
praise
of
them
they
would
be
a
little
hard
to
understand
perhaps
but
then
she
was
going
to
read
books
more
than
ever
and
get
knowledge
she
was
in
the
part
of
lambeth
walk
farthest
from
her
own
street
having
come
there
by
chance
for
she
had
observed
nothing
on
the
way
she
did
not
wish
to
go
home
yet
one
end
of
paradise
street
joins
the
walk
and
into
that
she
turned
if
only
there
were
a
chance
of
totty
nancarrow
being
at
home
but
totty
was
very
regular
at
work
still
an
inquiry
at
the
door
would
be
no
harm
little
jack
bunce
was
standing
in
the
open
doorway
he
had
a
rueful
countenance
marked
with
recent
tears
you
know
whether
miss
nancarrow
in
thyrza
asked
of
the
little
fellow
he
regarded
her
and
nodded
silently
she
really
in
she
up
in
her
room
was
the
grave
answer
thyrza
ran
upstairs
a
tap
at
the
door
and
voice
unmistakable
gave
admission
the
girl
sat
sewing
on
the
bed
lay
a
child
asleep
totty
looking
delighted
at
thyrza
coming
held
up
her
finger
to
impose
quietness
thyrza
took
the
only
other
chair
there
was
and
drew
it
near
to
her
friend
nelly
bunce
totty
said
in
a
low
voice
nodding
to
the
bed
when
i
was
going
back
to
work
what
did
the
child
do
but
tumble
head
over
heels
half
down
stairs
running
after
me
it
a
wonder
she
do
kill
herself
i
do
think
there
no
more
harm
done
except
a
big
bump
on
the
back
of
the
head
but
ladds
was
in
and
i
did
like
to
go
and
leave
the
little
thing
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
so
there
half
a
day
lost
thyrza
kept
silence
she
had
felt
that
she
would
like
to
talk
with
totty
yet
now
she
could
find
nothing
to
say
things
going
on
totty
asked
smiling
well
i
think
the
day
coming
thyrza
thyrza
played
with
the
ends
of
a
small
boa
which
was
about
her
neck
she
had
no
reply
her
tongue
refused
to
utter
a
sound
the
matter
thyrza
hand
fell
she
touched
the
sewing
that
was
on
totty
lap
then
she
touched
totty
hand
you
tell
me
about
about
mr
ackroyd
totty
drew
in
her
lips
knitted
her
brows
then
bent
to
bite
off
an
end
of
cotton
is
there
to
tell
she
asked
he
doing
as
he
promised
far
as
i
know
said
the
other
in
a
voice
which
affected
indifference
do
you
think
he
keep
right
till
christmas
a
good
deal
more
than
i
can
say
or
anybody
else
you
do
your
best
to
make
him
do
know
that
i
shall
bother
much
it
his
own
lookout
i
shall
know
what
he
means
if
he
goes
wrong
again
what
hope
he
keep
his
promise
thyrza
said
bending
a
little
nearer
and
dropping
her
eyes
as
soon
as
she
had
spoken
yes
perhaps
i
do
said
totty
putting
her
head
on
one
side
and
forthwith
she
began
to
hum
a
tune
which
however
she
checked
the
next
moment
remembering
nelly
you
speak
in
a
queer
way
totty
do
you
thyrza
what
are
you
bothering
about
again
she
searched
thyrza
face
this
time
with
something
very
curious
in
her
gaze
a
kind
of
suspicion
one
would
have
said
i
like
to
know
about
you
thyrza
said
with
embarrassment
told
you
all
there
is
to
tell
you
have
told
me
really
whether
do
you
she
sank
her
voice
still
lower
you
love
him
totty
a
singular
flush
came
and
went
upon
the
other
girl
face
she
herself
was
little
disposed
to
use
sentimental
words
and
it
was
the
first
time
that
thyrza
had
done
so
to
her
the
coarseness
she
heard
from
certain
of
her
companions
did
not
abash
her
but
this
word
of
thyrza
seemed
to
do
so
strangely
she
looked
up
in
a
moment
thyrza
face
was
agitated
does
that
matter
totty
said
in
a
rather
hard
voice
and
she
added
drawing
herself
up
awkwardly
made
your
own
choice
thyrza
for
an
instant
surprise
held
thyrza
mute
then
she
exclaimed
totty
you
do
think
i
was
thinking
of
you
dear
only
of
you
you
never
supposed
i
oh
say
you
did
think
that
totty
totty
relaxed
her
muscles
a
little
she
smiled
shook
her
head
laughed
uneasily
meant
dear
thyrza
continued
i
hope
you
do
love
him
as
you
going
to
marry
him
i
hope
you
love
him
very
much
and
i
hope
he
loves
you
i
sorry
i
said
that
i
thought
you
would
mind
do
mind
at
all
old
dear
if
you
know
i
like
him
pretty
well
it
ought
to
be
than
that
it
ought
totty
much
more
than
that
dear
she
was
trembling
totty
looked
at
her
in
surprise
coldly
go
on
like
that
she
said
you
woke
the
child
of
course
now
there
be
two
of
you
crying
see
which
can
make
most
noise
now
nelly
well
i
call
this
nice
at
the
sound
of
the
child
voice
thyrza
at
once
restrained
herself
and
rose
from
her
chair
totty
managed
to
quieten
her
little
charge
whom
she
took
upon
her
lap
she
did
not
look
at
thyrza
totty
said
the
latter
holding
out
her
hand
totty
returned
but
without
appearing
to
notice
the
hand
offered
hope
you
be
better
before
next
monday
thyrza
unkind
totty
i
wish
i
had
come
in
there
was
no
reply
to
this
so
thyrza
said
another
farewell
and
left
the
house
she
got
back
to
her
room
and
hopeless
of
otherwise
passing
the
time
till
lydia
return
lay
down
on
the
bed
perhaps
she
could
close
her
eyes
for
half
an
hour
but
when
she
had
turned
restlessly
from
one
side
to
the
other
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
she
knew
it
must
be
grail
and
made
no
answer
but
the
knock
was
repeated
and
the
door
opened
grail
looked
in
and
seeing
thyrza
came
to
the
bedside
you
well
my
dear
she
asked
gently
thyrza
made
pretence
of
having
just
awoke
thought
i
try
and
sleep
a
little
she
replied
holding
her
face
with
one
hand
i
do
feel
quite
well
quiet
then
i
wo
disturb
you
come
down
as
soon
as
you
like
some
tea
it
was
a
weary
time
till
lydia
returned
although
she
came
back
nearly
half
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
thyrza
still
lay
on
the
bed
when
they
had
exchanged
a
few
words
the
latter
said
do
think
i
can
go
lyddy
my
head
bad
what
a
pity
ca
we
do
something
to
make
it
better
thyrza
turned
her
face
away
altered
my
mind
lydia
continued
meant
to
go
with
you
you
go
with
us
thyrza
felt
that
this
would
lessen
the
strange
reluctance
with
which
through
the
afternoon
she
had
thought
of
the
concert
she
at
once
rose
and
consented
more
cheerfully
to
try
if
a
cup
of
tea
would
help
her
she
bathed
her
forehead
smoothed
her
hair
and
went
down
it
was
not
long
before
gilbert
entered
he
too
having
come
away
earlier
from
work
in
order
to
get
a
seat
in
the
gallery
of
the
concert
hall
they
must
be
soon
at
the
doors
thyrza
declared
that
she
felt
much
better
her
heavy
eyes
gave
little
assurance
of
this
but
something
of
her
eagerness
had
returned
and
for
the
time
she
had
indeed
succeeded
in
subduing
the
torment
within
an
omnibus
took
the
three
into
piccadilly
they
were
not
too
early
at
the
hall
for
the
accustomed
crowd
had
already
begun
to
assemble
thyrza
locked
her
arm
in
her
sister
gilbert
standing
behind
them
he
whispered
a
word
now
and
then
to
one
or
the
other
but
thyrza
kept
silence
her
cheeks
were
flushed
she
inspected
all
the
faces
about
her
at
length
admission
was
gained
and
seats
secured
thyrza
sat
between
the
other
two
but
she
still
kept
her
hold
on
lydia
arm
until
the
latter
said
laughingly
not
afraid
of
losing
me
now
i
expect
we
shall
be
dreadfully
hot
here
soon
she
withdrew
her
hand
gilbert
began
to
talk
to
her
had
it
not
been
for
the
circumstances
he
must
have
observed
a
difference
in
manner
to
him
she
scarcely
ever
met
his
look
and
when
she
spoke
it
was
with
none
of
the
usual
spontaneity
but
she
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
observation
of
the
people
who
had
begun
to
seat
themselves
in
other
parts
of
the
hall
the
toilettes
were
a
wonder
to
her
lydia
too
they
interested
very
much
she
frequently
whispered
a
comment
on
such
as
seemed
to
her
or
the
contrary
she
could
not
help
trying
to
think
how
thyrza
would
look
if
like
a
lady
thyrza
started
so
perceptibly
that
lydia
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
she
answered
moving
as
if
to
seat
herself
more
comfortably
but
henceforth
her
eyes
were
fixed
in
one
direction
on
a
point
down
in
the
body
of
the
hall
she
no
longer
replied
to
the
remarks
of
either
of
her
companions
the
flush
remained
warm
upon
her
cheeks
whispered
gilbert
when
the
musicians
were
in
their
places
and
the
preliminary
twanging
and
screeching
of
instruments
under
correction
had
begun
mr
egremont
he
where
you
see
that
tall
lady
in
the
red
cloak
no
more
to
the
left
there
a
bald
man
on
the
other
side
of
him
i
see
him
she
waited
a
moment
then
repeated
the
news
to
lydia
with
singular
indifference
then
she
began
to
gaze
in
quite
other
directions
the
instrumental
uproar
continued
dear
said
lydia
with
a
wry
face
i
sure
that
kind
of
music
wo
do
your
head
any
good
is
it
still
better
think
so
yes
yes
does
take
anything
like
that
time
to
tune
his
fiddle
the
other
whispered
conscious
that
she
was
daring
in
her
criticism
thyrza
on
an
impulse
conveyed
the
remark
to
gilbert
who
laughed
silently
the
concert
began
thyrza
eyes
had
again
fixed
themselves
on
that
point
down
below
and
during
the
first
piece
they
did
not
once
move
her
breathing
was
quick
the
heart
in
her
bosom
seemed
to
swell
as
always
when
some
great
emotion
possessed
her
and
with
difficulty
she
kept
her
vision
unclouded
lydia
often
looked
at
her
so
did
gilbert
she
was
unconscious
of
it
you
like
that
gilbert
asked
her
when
the
piece
was
over
very
much
she
had
leaned
back
lydia
sought
her
hand
she
received
a
pressure
in
return
but
the
other
hand
did
not
remain
as
she
expected
it
would
gilbert
himself
was
not
much
disposed
to
speak
he
too
was
moved
in
the
secret
places
of
his
being
moved
to
that
ominous
tumult
of
conflicting
joy
and
pain
which
in
the
finer
natures
comes
of
music
intensely
heard
he
had
been
at
concerts
before
but
had
little
anticipated
that
he
would
ever
attend
one
in
such
a
mood
as
was
his
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
not
yet
realised
his
happiness
that
in
his
most
rapturous
moments
he
had
rated
it
but
poorly
unimaginatively
the
strong
wings
of
that
glorious
wordless
song
bore
him
into
a
finer
air
where
his
faculties
of
mind
and
heart
grew
unconditioned
if
it
were
possible
to
go
back
into
the
world
endowed
as
in
these
moments
to
the
greatest
man
has
come
the
same
transfiguration
the
same
woe
of
foreseen
return
to
limits
but
one
thing
was
real
and
would
not
fail
him
she
who
sat
by
him
was
his
his
now
and
for
ever
why
had
he
yet
loved
her
so
little
the
second
piece
began
again
thyrza
looked
down
into
the
hall
after
a
while
there
came
a
piece
of
vocal
music
the
singer
was
not
of
much
reputation
but
to
thyrza
her
voice
seemed
more
than
human
in
the
interval
which
followed
she
whispered
to
lydia
shall
never
pretend
to
sing
again
egremont
had
risen
in
his
place
and
was
looking
about
him
thyrza
was
yet
in
some
doubt
whether
he
was
alone
but
he
had
not
yet
spoken
to
that
lady
next
to
him
and
now
on
sitting
down
he
did
not
speak
he
must
be
without
companion
chapter
xx
rapids
in
the
crowd
with
which
they
mingled
on
passing
out
again
thyrza
saw
men
in
evening
dress
she
looked
in
every
direction
for
egremont
but
was
disappointed
gilbert
had
begged
her
to
hold
his
arm
he
moved
forward
as
quickly
as
possible
and
with
lydia
following
they
were
soon
in
the
street
gilbert
wished
to
cross
for
the
sake
of
quickly
getting
out
of
the
throng
thyrza
threw
one
glance
back
a
hat
was
raised
by
someone
going
in
the
opposite
direction
who
also
had
turned
his
head
she
had
seen
him
she
was
glad
he
did
not
come
up
to
speak
could
he
discern
the
flash
of
joy
which
passed
over
her
face
as
she
recognised
him
she
hoped
he
had
but
at
once
hoped
that
he
had
not
there
was
waiting
for
an
omnibus
thyrza
still
had
her
arm
within
gilbert
she
was
unconscious
of
all
the
bustle
amid
which
she
stood
unconscious
of
the
pressure
with
which
gilbert
drew
her
nearer
to
him
when
at
length
bidden
she
entered
the
vehicle
and
leaned
back
with
her
eyes
closed
how
dark
and
quiet
these
streets
of
lambeth
seemed
as
she
passed
the
threshold
of
the
house
a
sudden
chill
fell
upon
her
and
she
shook
how
sombre
the
passage
was
with
its
dim
lamp
suspended
against
the
wall
voices
seemed
strange
when
grail
welcomed
her
in
the
parlour
she
did
not
recognise
the
sound
she
could
not
be
persuaded
to
get
to
bed
immediately
neither
could
she
sit
still
but
walked
restlessly
about
the
floor
hot
it
is
she
complained
to
lydia
you
mind
if
i
open
the
window
just
a
little
do
but
i
afraid
it
give
you
cold
now
do
undress
there
a
dear
for
a
minute
she
threw
the
window
up
and
stood
breathing
the
air
her
thoughts
strayed
into
the
darkness
had
egremont
gone
to
the
concert
just
because
she
mentioned
that
she
was
going
it
was
not
likely
but
perhaps
so
when
should
she
see
him
to
speak
of
it
would
he
still
be
arranging
books
the
next
morning
thyrza
you
shut
the
window
i
shall
be
angry
do
as
i
tell
you
and
get
to
bed
at
once
at
the
voice
thyrza
drew
the
window
down
then
turned
and
stood
before
her
sister
as
if
she
were
going
to
say
something
but
she
did
not
speak
you
feel
ill
dear
lydia
asked
anxiously
well
lyddy
do
get
cross
with
me
i
go
to
bed
directly
she
walked
again
the
length
of
the
room
then
began
to
hum
an
air
it
was
the
first
song
of
the
concert
she
took
the
crumpled
programme
from
her
pocket
and
glanced
over
it
lydia
moved
impatiently
thyrza
put
the
programme
down
on
the
table
and
began
to
loosen
her
dress
you
glad
you
went
lyddy
she
asked
in
a
tired
voice
sha
be
glad
we
any
of
us
went
if
it
going
to
make
you
ill
thyrza
shall
be
all
right
i
dare
say
i
wonder
whether
egremont
often
goes
to
concerts
likely
he
can
afford
it
must
go
again
for
a
long
time
she
had
seated
herself
on
the
bed
and
was
undoing
the
braid
of
her
hair
she
spoke
the
last
words
thoughtfully
in
a
minute
or
two
the
light
was
out
lydia
soon
fell
asleep
in
the
very
early
morning
a
movement
of
her
sister
awoke
her
she
found
that
thyrza
was
sitting
up
in
the
bed
is
it
dear
she
asked
down
and
go
to
sleep
ca
lyddy
i
ca
i
so
tired
and
i
have
closed
my
eyes
keep
awake
with
me
a
minute
will
you
lydia
took
the
sleepless
girl
in
her
arms
music
wo
leave
me
thyrza
moaned
just
as
if
i
heard
them
playing
now
lydia
nursed
her
into
a
fitful
sleep
though
thyrza
had
no
work
to
go
to
she
still
always
rose
together
with
her
sister
and
whilst
the
latter
put
the
room
in
order
went
down
to
assist
grail
in
getting
the
breakfast
but
on
the
morning
after
the
concert
lydia
was
glad
to
see
that
the
head
beside
her
own
was
weighed
down
with
sleep
when
the
hour
for
rising
had
come
she
dressed
as
quietly
as
possible
leaving
the
blind
drawn
and
descended
to
say
that
thyrza
would
be
a
little
longer
than
usual
gilbert
was
in
the
parlour
she
slept
well
he
asked
very
well
she
could
get
the
sound
of
the
music
out
of
her
ears
but
she
fast
now
shall
have
to
be
careful
of
her
lyddy
gilbert
said
anxiously
for
he
had
had
her
face
before
him
all
night
with
its
pale
wearied
look
of
he
knew
how
delicate
a
nature
it
was
that
he
was
going
to
take
into
his
charge
and
already
his
love
was
at
times
gently
mingled
with
fear
lydia
went
upstairs
again
and
softly
into
the
room
thyrza
had
just
awoke
and
was
sitting
with
her
hands
together
upon
her
face
time
is
it
she
asked
did
you
let
me
sleep
have
you
been
up
long
lydia
constrained
her
to
lie
down
again
she
was
unwilling
at
first
but
in
the
end
fell
back
with
a
sigh
of
relief
day
is
it
lyddy
oh
tuesday
of
course
i
suppose
the
days
go
very
slow
till
saturday
i
sure
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
all
the
time
trouble
about
it
now
dear
try
and
sleep
a
little
more
and
i
bring
you
up
some
breakfast
just
before
i
go
be
like
when
i
was
poorly
wo
it
lyddy
she
lay
and
laughed
quietly
feel
better
yes
is
it
a
fine
morning
pavement
just
drying
she
drew
the
clothes
over
her
head
lydia
could
hear
her
still
laughing
and
wondered
thyrza
could
not
have
told
what
it
was
that
amused
her
she
did
not
sleep
again
but
had
breakfast
in
bed
lydia
sat
with
her
as
long
as
possible
thyrza
as
soon
as
she
heard
the
front
door
close
behind
her
sister
sprang
on
to
the
floor
and
began
to
dress
with
nervous
rapidity
her
hands
were
so
unsteady
that
she
had
all
sorts
of
difficulties
with
buttons
and
hooks
and
eyes
trouble
with
your
hair
lydia
had
said
do
it
at
but
thyrza
could
not
obey
in
this
she
did
the
plaiting
twice
over
being
dissatisfied
with
the
first
result
and
even
took
a
new
piece
of
blue
ribbon
for
the
ends
the
sun
was
shining
that
always
affected
her
pleasurably
and
this
morning
as
soon
as
she
was
dressed
a
gladness
altogether
without
conscious
reason
made
her
sing
again
the
song
of
the
concert
the
air
which
she
could
not
wholly
remember
the
night
before
had
grown
to
completeness
in
her
mind
she
longed
to
know
the
words
that
the
whole
song
might
henceforth
stay
with
her
and
the
sun
so
rare
in
our
dull
skies
seemed
to
warm
the
opposite
houses
she
threw
open
the
window
and
heard
the
clocks
striking
nine
just
make
the
bed
and
put
things
straight
then
oh
then
i
must
really
go
and
do
something
for
grail
i
left
her
alone
nearly
all
yesterday
and
then
i
might
go
and
meet
lyddy
but
it
a
long
time
till
twelve
perhaps
having
made
the
bed
she
sat
down
to
rest
for
a
moment
after
all
the
headache
was
certainly
not
gone
though
it
had
been
disguising
itself
the
moment
grew
to
a
quarter
of
an
hour
her
eyes
seemed
to
behold
something
very
clearly
just
in
front
down
there
on
the
floor
but
the
floor
itself
had
made
way
for
a
large
hall
among
rows
of
people
she
saw
a
tall
lady
in
a
red
cloak
and
a
gentleman
and
between
them
someone
whose
face
was
at
an
angle
which
allowed
her
to
see
it
very
well
to
note
even
the
look
not
quite
a
smile
of
pleasure
which
made
it
so
interesting
she
knew
no
other
face
which
affected
her
as
that
did
she
desired
it
to
turn
full
upon
her
to
look
straight
into
hers
with
its
clear
gentle
eyes
which
seemed
to
be
so
full
of
wonderful
knowledge
once
or
twice
yes
in
truth
once
or
twice
it
had
done
so
but
never
for
long
enough
it
would
do
so
yet
again
oh
but
not
for
long
enough
a
look
not
of
instants
but
of
minutes
of
full
minutes
ticked
to
their
last
second
what
would
she
give
for
that
one
such
gaze
and
she
would
be
satisfied
it
was
not
to
ask
much
surely
not
much
but
she
was
going
to
live
there
behind
the
library
and
he
would
come
often
very
often
for
a
time
he
would
certainly
come
every
day
to
be
sure
she
could
not
see
him
daily
her
duties
would
be
in
the
house
she
would
be
a
wife
people
would
call
her
grail
a
voice
whispered
a
very
timid
one
would
have
said
a
guilty
voice
will
be
called
egremont
not
once
the
voice
faint
as
it
was
had
an
echo
a
tingling
echo
from
her
heart
outwards
to
the
smallest
vein
who
will
bear
that
name
some
tall
beautiful
lady
such
as
miss
newthorpe
was
there
any
one
who
at
this
moment
sat
alone
longing
for
one
look
of
his
eyes
did
ladies
think
and
feel
in
that
way
or
only
foolish
little
who
all
their
lives
had
dreamed
dreams
of
a
world
that
was
not
theirs
did
ladies
ever
press
down
a
heart
beating
almost
to
anguish
and
say
to
themselves
love
you
no
a
stately
life
theirs
no
weakness
no
sense
of
a
measureless
need
ever
and
ever
respect
from
all
about
them
think
of
miss
newthorpe
face
how
noble
it
was
how
impossible
that
it
should
plead
for
anything
it
might
concede
with
a
high
gracious
smile
but
not
beseech
anything
that
was
the
part
of
poor
girls
who
had
not
been
taught
in
whom
it
was
no
shame
to
look
up
to
one
far
above
them
and
long
long
for
kindness
the
sunlight
was
creeping
along
the
floor
nearer
to
her
oh
sun
of
spring
nearer
nearer
your
warmth
upon
my
hands
upon
my
face
your
warmth
upon
my
heart
that
warm
may
press
there
the
clocks
were
striking
ten
it
was
unkind
to
leave
grail
alone
the
girl
hired
to
do
rough
work
was
coming
today
but
for
all
that
it
behoved
her
to
be
attentive
to
the
good
old
lady
who
never
spoke
to
her
save
with
good
motherly
words
yes
away
with
it
all
she
must
go
down
and
be
company
to
mother
had
she
forgotten
that
in
less
than
a
week
she
would
be
gilbert
wife
a
simple
test
could
she
speak
out
these
thoughts
of
hers
to
lyddy
the
hot
current
in
her
veins
was
answer
enough
and
that
had
been
the
criterion
of
right
and
wrong
with
her
since
she
was
a
little
child
lyddy
knew
the
right
instinctively
and
never
failed
to
act
upon
her
knowledge
what
had
been
lyddy
thoughts
of
luke
ackroyd
perhaps
not
very
different
from
these
to
which
she
had
been
listening
for
lyddy
too
was
a
not
a
lady
yet
the
brave
sister
had
kept
it
all
hidden
away
more
had
done
her
very
best
to
bring
together
luke
and
someone
else
whom
he
loved
how
was
it
possible
to
reach
that
height
of
unselfishness
but
the
example
should
not
be
without
its
effect
thyrza
presented
herself
in
the
parlour
the
room
was
in
some
disorder
a
girl
was
on
her
knees
by
the
fireplace
cleaning
thyrza
went
down
to
the
little
back
kitchen
which
was
behind
the
room
where
and
jarmey
practically
lived
it
was
dark
and
cold
grail
was
making
a
pudding
my
dear
she
said
nodding
several
times
now
i
hoped
you
would
be
down
yet
but
i
suppose
you
could
sleep
for
the
sunshine
i
do
think
you
ought
to
sit
here
but
i
going
to
help
you
please
give
me
something
to
do
shall
i
clean
these
knives
idea
charlotte
be
down
to
do
those
directly
if
you
really
do
find
it
too
cold
here
you
may
tell
me
something
about
the
concert
i
tell
you
but
i
must
work
at
the
same
time
i
want
to
i
yes
i
shall
do
the
knives
please
do
be
cross
she
was
bent
on
it
grail
quietly
acquiesced
for
ten
minutes
thyrza
wrought
strenuously
at
the
speaking
only
a
few
words
then
the
girl
charlotte
made
her
appearance
thyrza
grail
said
you
really
want
something
to
do
suppose
you
go
and
dust
upstairs
you
have
dusted
yet
have
you
charlotte
mum
not
yet
thyrza
rubbed
away
for
a
minute
longer
then
agreed
to
go
up
to
the
lighter
work
her
head
had
not
profited
by
the
violent
exercise
dusting
is
an
occupation
not
incompatible
with
reverie
how
hard
it
was
to
keep
her
mind
from
the
subject
which
she
had
determined
not
to
think
of
as
often
as
her
face
turned
to
the
sunlight
that
longing
came
back
grail
joined
her
presently
we
know
that
the
old
lady
had
no
fondness
for
domestic
bustle
she
sat
down
and
at
length
persuaded
thyrza
to
do
the
same
at
eleven
grail
said
dear
i
think
you
ought
to
go
out
for
a
little
while
it
so
bright
i
not
at
all
sure
that
the
sun
last
till
dinnertime
getting
rather
uncertain
just
go
into
kennington
road
and
back
thyrza
shook
her
head
this
morning
i
a
little
tired
but
it
make
you
feel
more
cheerful
and
you
have
an
appetite
for
dinner
which
i
sure
you
have
had
for
a
week
and
more
how
ever
you
live
on
the
few
mouthfuls
you
eat
is
a
wonder
to
me
you
ought
to
have
half
an
hour
walk
every
day
indeed
you
ought
it
was
sorely
against
her
will
to
go
forth
yet
desire
called
to
her
from
the
sunlit
ways
slowly
down
the
stairs
slowly
to
the
end
of
walnut
tree
walk
look
at
that
white
billow
of
cloud
on
its
fathomless
ocean
even
now
there
were
clouds
like
that
high
up
over
eastbourne
one
such
had
hung
above
her
as
she
drove
with
ormonde
up
beachy
head
at
this
moment
the
sea
was
singing
this
breeze
which
swept
the
path
of
may
made
foam
flash
upon
the
pebbled
shore
sky
and
water
met
on
that
line
of
mystery
far
away
and
beyond
was
the
coast
of
france
more
quickly
now
whither
was
she
tending
she
had
at
first
kept
southwards
straight
along
kennington
road
now
she
had
crossed
and
was
turning
into
a
street
which
might
only
might
conduct
her
round
into
brook
street
desire
was
in
her
feet
she
could
no
longer
check
them
she
must
hasten
on
whithersoever
they
led
oh
why
had
she
left
the
house
why
had
grail
a
cruel
mother
bidden
her
go
forth
when
her
will
was
to
stay
and
work
and
forget
could
she
not
stop
even
now
and
turn
she
stopped
was
it
likely
that
he
would
be
there
this
morning
no
not
very
likely
he
would
finish
all
the
books
yesterday
yet
others
might
have
been
brought
if
he
would
give
her
one
long
look
the
look
for
which
she
fainted
then
that
should
be
the
end
that
should
be
the
very
end
she
would
not
play
with
danger
after
that
for
now
she
knew
that
it
was
danger
that
thought
of
lyddy
had
made
everything
terribly
clear
he
would
never
know
anything
of
what
had
been
in
her
foolish
heart
and
it
would
cost
him
nothing
to
look
once
at
her
with
a
rich
kind
look
he
was
all
kindness
he
had
done
was
doing
things
such
as
no
other
man
in
his
position
ever
thought
of
she
would
like
to
tell
him
the
immeasurable
worship
with
which
his
nobleness
inspired
her
but
the
right
words
would
never
come
to
her
and
the
wrong
would
be
so
near
her
lips
no
one
look
for
him
and
therewith
an
end
the
library
was
within
sight
she
had
walked
very
quickly
if
he
should
not
be
there
her
hand
was
on
the
door
the
bitterness
of
it
if
the
door
proved
to
be
locked
it
was
open
she
was
in
the
little
entrance
hall
at
the
door
of
the
library
itself
she
stood
listening
was
that
a
sound
of
someone
within
no
only
the
beat
of
her
own
heart
the
throb
which
seemed
as
if
it
must
kill
her
she
not
open
the
door
she
had
not
the
strength
to
stand
the
pain
the
pain
yet
she
had
turned
the
handle
and
had
entered
he
was
in
the
act
of
placing
volumes
on
the
shelves
she
moved
forward
and
he
looked
round
that
was
not
the
look
she
desired
surprise
at
first
surprise
blent
with
pleasure
but
then
a
gravity
which
was
all
but
disapproval
yet
he
gave
his
hand
miss
trent
the
voice
was
scrupulously
subdued
as
inflexionless
as
he
could
make
it
am
still
at
my
secret
work
you
see
when
i
went
away
for
lunch
yesterday
something
prevented
me
from
returning
so
i
came
down
again
this
morning
have
got
them
nearly
all
put
up
she
could
not
face
him
but
kept
her
eyes
on
the
almost
empty
cases
but
i
expect
some
more
this
afternoon
he
walked
away
from
her
with
books
in
his
hands
thyrza
felt
ashamed
what
must
he
think
of
her
it
was
almost
rude
to
come
in
this
way
without
shadow
of
excuse
doubtless
he
was
punishing
her
by
this
cold
manner
yet
he
could
not
unsay
what
he
had
said
yesterday
and
his
recognition
of
her
just
outside
the
hall
last
night
had
been
so
friendly
she
felt
that
her
mode
of
addressing
him
had
been
too
unceremonious
the
of
their
former
intercourse
seemed
demanded
again
yet
to
use
it
would
be
plain
disregard
of
his
request
must
she
speak
another
word
and
go
that
would
be
very
hard
shame
and
embarrassment
notwithstanding
it
was
so
sweet
to
be
here
nay
the
shame
itself
was
luxury
he
said
am
so
sorry
i
have
a
chair
to
offer
you
if
i
put
the
top
on
this
box
that
is
a
very
rude
sort
of
seat
but
then
he
wished
her
to
remain
a
little
or
was
it
mere
politeness
which
modesty
should
direct
her
to
meet
with
similar
refusal
it
was
so
hard
that
she
did
not
know
what
was
proper
how
she
was
expected
to
behave
in
the
meantime
the
seat
was
improvised
he
asked
her
with
a
smile
if
she
would
take
it
you
egremont
i
afraid
i
must
stay
or
only
a
minute
he
glanced
at
the
inner
door
leading
to
the
house
had
some
sound
come
thence
thyrza
seated
herself
with
one
hand
she
held
the
edge
of
the
box
nervously
her
eyes
were
bent
downwards
egremont
again
walked
away
from
her
on
returning
he
said
in
the
same
almost
expressionless
tone
hope
you
enjoyed
the
concert
last
night
this
was
what
she
had
wished
that
he
would
speak
of
the
concert
did
so
very
much
she
replied
and
as
she
spoke
her
face
was
lifted
he
was
regarding
her
and
did
not
at
once
avert
his
eyes
for
an
appreciable
space
of
time
they
looked
at
each
other
was
she
then
satisfied
could
she
leave
him
now
and
draw
a
hard
line
between
this
hour
and
the
future
less
satisfied
than
ever
his
gaze
was
a
mystery
it
seemed
so
cold
and
yet
and
yet
what
did
it
suggest
to
her
that
just
observable
tremor
on
his
lip
that
slight
motion
of
the
forehead
those
things
spoke
to
her
miraculously
sharpened
sense
and
yet
she
could
not
interpret
their
language
it
was
very
far
from
the
look
she
had
yearned
for
yet
perhaps
it
affected
her
more
profoundly
than
a
frank
gaze
of
kindness
would
have
done
he
moved
a
little
again
glancing
at
the
inner
door
was
there
myself
were
his
next
words
i
saw
you
in
the
hall
i
mean
not
only
afterwards
uttered
without
forethought
she
desired
to
say
that
and
had
said
it
you
he
said
more
coldly
still
pointed
you
out
to
us
it
was
true
and
it
involved
a
falsehood
egremont
happened
to
regard
her
as
she
spoke
and
at
once
a
blush
came
to
her
cheeks
to
what
was
she
falling
why
did
she
tell
untruths
without
the
least
need
she
could
not
understand
the
motive
which
had
impelled
her
to
that
egremont
had
a
distinct
frown
on
his
face
it
was
as
though
he
read
her
deceit
and
despised
her
for
it
thyrza
added
confusedly
sister
went
with
us
she
had
meant
to
but
gilbert
persuaded
her
at
last
you
remember
which
piece
you
liked
best
i
could
say
it
was
all
so
beautiful
i
liked
the
songs
so
much
grail
must
take
you
to
hear
better
singers
than
those
they
good
she
asked
in
astonishment
not
bad
but
not
really
excellent
he
mentioned
one
or
two
names
and
spoke
in
particular
of
a
concert
shortly
to
be
given
at
which
such
singers
would
be
heard
have
heard
them
thyrza
asked
gazing
at
him
times
should
be
almost
afraid
he
thought
it
a
wonderful
word
to
come
from
this
untaught
girl
again
their
eyes
met
he
laughed
like
my
own
feeling
when
i
got
out
at
niagara
station
and
began
to
walk
towards
the
falls
i
dreaded
the
first
sight
of
them
he
was
purposely
turning
it
to
a
jest
he
durst
not
reply
to
her
in
her
own
mood
and
he
saw
that
she
had
not
understood
have
heard
of
niagara
egremont
will
you
tell
me
about
it
he
made
a
very
brief
pause
and
she
noticed
it
with
fear
did
he
despise
her
ignorance
or
did
he
think
her
troublesome
yet
he
began
to
explain
and
was
soon
speaking
much
more
freely
almost
as
he
had
spoken
that
evening
in
the
grails
room
when
he
told
of
his
he
ended
somewhat
abruptly
and
went
to
the
shelves
with
books
thyrza
rose
and
followed
him
he
looked
back
strangely
as
if
startled
i
look
at
the
books
i
put
up
yesterday
she
asked
timorously
yes
there
is
old
gibbon
our
he
has
much
now
again
he
laughed
the
laugh
troubled
her
she
preferred
him
to
be
grave
some
more
books
are
coming
she
said
this
afternoon
egremont
may
i
come
and
help
to
put
up
a
few
morning
again
her
tongue
uttered
words
in
defiance
of
herself
she
could
not
believe
it
when
the
words
were
spoken
egremont
perused
the
floor
the
slight
frown
had
returned
perhaps
i
shall
be
in
your
way
she
continued
hastily
think
i
am
troublesome
you
are
not
at
all
miss
trent
i
should
be
very
glad
if
if
you
are
sure
you
can
spare
the
time
can
quite
well
i
do
a
little
work
for
grail
but
that
take
anything
like
all
the
morning
a
word
was
on
his
tongue
he
was
about
to
say
that
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
after
all
to
tell
grail
and
for
thyrza
to
ask
the
permission
he
even
began
to
speak
but
hesitated
ceased
i
come
at
this
same
time
thyrza
inquired
her
voice
almost
failing
her
shall
be
here
at
about
eleven
certainly
by
i
will
come
i
shall
be
so
glad
to
help
a
pronoun
was
lost
something
prevented
its
utterance
egremont
made
no
reply
thyrza
found
power
to
hold
her
hand
out
and
take
leave
how
often
they
seemed
to
have
held
each
other
hand
chapter
xxi
mischief
afoot
it
would
have
been
a
remarkable
thing
if
egremont
had
succeeded
even
for
a
day
or
two
in
keeping
secret
his
work
at
the
library
the
vulgar
in
lambeth
are
not
a
jot
less
diligent
in
prying
and
gossip
than
are
their
kin
in
mayfair
and
chance
is
wont
to
be
all
the
world
over
when
bower
passed
the
library
in
the
on
monday
and
after
seeing
thyrza
trent
come
out
forthwith
observed
egremont
standing
within
at
the
window
his
mind
busied
itself
with
the
coincidence
very
much
as
it
might
have
been
expected
to
do
when
he
reached
home
he
privately
reported
the
little
incident
to
his
wife
they
looked
at
each
other
and
bower
lowered
first
one
eyelid
then
the
other
grail
still
at
his
work
bower
inquired
enough
he
goes
on
till
saturday
ackroyd
told
me
so
yesterday
her
sister
at
work
too
enough
the
workmen
there
still
they
all
out
safe
enough
bower
seemed
to
find
a
satisfaction
in
repeating
the
significant
phrase
he
chuckled
disagreeably
looks
queer
remarked
his
wife
with
a
certain
contemptuousness
looks
uncommon
queer
i
wonder
whether
old
butterfield
happened
to
be
safe
likewise
he
nodded
look
in
and
have
a
word
with
the
old
lady
eh
butterfield
husband
some
years
deceased
had
been
a
with
bower
the
latter
prying
about
the
as
soon
as
he
heard
that
egremont
was
going
to
convert
it
into
a
library
had
discovered
that
the
caretaker
was
known
to
him
there
seemed
at
the
time
no
particular
profit
to
be
derived
from
the
circumstance
but
bower
regarded
it
much
as
he
would
have
done
a
piece
of
lumber
that
might
have
come
into
his
possession
as
a
thing
just
to
be
kept
in
mind
if
perchance
some
use
for
it
should
some
day
be
discovered
it
is
this
habit
of
thought
that
helps
the
bower
species
to
become
petty
capitalists
we
call
it
thrift
and
respecting
public
opinion
we
do
not
refuse
our
admiration
on
monday
evening
about
eight
bower
went
up
to
the
in
the
rear
of
the
building
and
knocked
the
door
was
opened
about
two
inches
and
an
aged
voice
asked
who
was
there
me
butterfield
bower
was
the
pleasantly
modulated
reply
the
door
opened
a
little
wider
egremont
happen
to
be
here
the
visitor
went
on
to
ask
bower
he
ai
here
nor
likely
to
come
again
to
night
i
should
think
mind
i
dare
say
you
let
me
have
a
look
in
just
to
see
how
things
is
goin
on
i
saw
him
at
the
window
as
i
passed
at
and
we
just
nodded
to
each
other
but
i
had
time
to
stop
the
old
woman
admitted
him
in
the
house
was
an
exultant
savour
of
frying
onions
a
hissing
sound
came
from
the
your
supper
eh
mrs
butterfield
said
bower
with
genial
familiarity
that
right
make
yourself
comfortable
do
you
fuss
about
now
i
sit
down
here
i
like
the
smell
butterfield
was
not
at
all
the
same
woman
with
this
visitor
that
she
was
with
strangers
for
one
thing
he
brought
back
to
her
the
memory
of
days
when
she
had
possessed
a
home
of
her
own
and
had
not
yet
been
soured
by
then
again
bower
belonged
to
her
own
class
for
all
his
money
saved
up
and
his
pomposities
of
manner
there
is
a
freemasonry
between
the
members
of
the
proletariat
they
are
ever
ready
in
recognition
of
each
other
and
their
suspicion
of
all
above
them
whether
by
rank
or
by
nature
is
a
sense
of
the
utmost
keenness
butterfield
varied
somewhat
from
the
type
inasmuch
as
she
did
not
care
to
cringe
before
her
superiors
but
that
was
an
accident
in
essentials
of
feeling
she
and
bower
were
at
one
the
table
was
half
covered
with
a
dirty
cloth
on
which
stood
a
loaf
of
bread
plateless
a
small
dish
ready
to
receive
the
fry
and
a
jug
of
beer
in
the
midst
of
the
newly
painted
and
papered
room
which
seemed
ready
to
receive
furniture
of
a
more
elegant
kind
than
that
of
homes
these
things
had
an
incongruity
how
does
the
world
use
butterfield
bower
asked
as
he
settled
his
bulky
body
on
the
small
chair
earn
my
bed
and
my
victuals
bower
was
the
reply
as
the
old
woman
stirred
her
hissing
mess
with
a
fork
a
thing
to
be
proud
of
at
your
age
from
such
friendly
dialogue
bower
gradually
turned
the
talk
to
egremont
of
whom
he
spoke
at
first
as
a
respected
intimate
observation
of
his
collocutor
led
him
shortly
to
alter
his
tone
a
little
when
he
had
heard
that
books
were
already
arriving
he
remarked
as
much
as
to
say
that
you
soon
be
turned
out
butterfield
well
i
call
it
hard
at
your
age
now
if
egremont
had
acted
like
a
gentleman
and
had
offered
to
be
librarian
still
have
kept
your
place
here
i
do
want
to
say
disagreeable
things
but
if
ever
there
was
a
mean
and
indecent
action
it
was
when
he
passed
over
and
gave
the
place
to
a
stranger
why
butterfield
he
has
to
thank
for
everything
but
for
never
have
had
a
soul
to
hear
his
lectures
well
well
it
matter
and
what
do
you
think
o
the
young
girl
as
is
coming
to
keep
house
here
after
you
butterfield
was
turning
out
her
supper
into
the
dish
she
gave
him
a
peculiar
look
she
goin
to
be
wed
was
her
question
in
reply
monday
does
the
man
as
is
goin
to
marry
her
know
as
she
comes
here
to
meet
this
young
gent
comes
to
meet
him
she
now
tut
tut
tut
but
we
think
harm
butterfield
though
you
can
tell
from
her
face
need
a
good
deal
of
looking
after
and
does
she
come
regular
now
the
old
woman
confessed
that
she
only
knew
of
two
meetings
with
a
very
long
interval
but
she
hinted
that
the
first
had
taken
place
under
circumstances
very
suspicious
in
fact
that
it
was
obviously
an
appointment
and
this
morning
as
soon
as
she
knew
of
thyrza
presence
in
the
library
by
the
borrowing
of
the
hammer
she
had
kept
a
secret
espial
through
the
of
the
inner
door
with
the
result
that
she
witnessed
the
two
chatting
together
in
a
way
sufficiently
noteworthy
considering
the
difference
of
their
stations
the
matter
having
been
made
to
bear
all
the
fruit
it
would
in
malevolent
discussion
bower
left
the
old
woman
at
her
supper
and
with
a
candle
went
to
explore
the
state
of
the
library
he
did
not
remain
long
for
the
big
room
was
very
cold
and
shortly
after
rejoining
the
caretaker
he
bade
her
the
friendliest
consider
you
done
very
right
to
tell
me
this
he
said
as
she
went
to
let
him
out
opinion
it
something
as
grail
ought
to
know
you
keep
an
eye
open
morning
depend
upon
it
doing
a
good
work
i
should
wonder
if
i
look
in
night
and
i
dare
say
you
could
do
with
a
nice
bit
of
cheese
eh
i
see
if
i
can
pick
a
bit
out
of
the
shop
on
tuesday
night
he
repeated
his
visit
bringing
half
a
pound
of
very
strong
american
in
his
pocket
he
heard
a
shocking
story
thyrza
had
again
been
to
the
library
and
so
secretly
that
but
for
her
station
at
the
butterfield
would
have
known
nothing
of
it
well
now
tut
tut
tut
commented
portly
bower
think
you
never
trust
these
young
men
as
have
more
money
than
they
know
what
to
do
with
but
i
did
think
it
of
egremont
the
kind
of
fellow
as
comes
to
preach
to
the
working
man
and
tell
him
of
his
faults
bah
well
i
not
one
for
going
about
spreading
storie
grail
must
take
his
chance
perhaps
it
be
as
well
butterfield
if
kept
this
little
affair
quiet
just
between
you
and
me
you
know
there
no
eh
a
time
may
eh
none
of
our
business
eh
you
understand
butterfield
it
might
be
as
well
to
keep
an
eye
open
to
the
end
of
the
week
bower
on
the
way
home
turned
into
his
club
just
to
drink
a
glass
of
whisky
at
the
club
price
in
the
were
a
few
men
occupied
with
newspapers
or
in
chat
in
a
corner
reading
his
favourite
organ
of
thought
sat
luke
ackroyd
bower
got
his
glass
of
spirits
brought
it
into
the
and
sat
down
by
ackroyd
our
friend
egremont
begun
to
get
his
books
together
he
began
he
luke
was
indifferent
of
late
he
had
entered
upon
a
new
phase
of
his
mental
trouble
he
was
averse
from
conversation
shrank
from
his
old
companions
seemed
to
have
resumed
studious
habits
it
had
got
about
that
he
was
going
to
marry
totty
nancarrow
but
he
refused
to
answer
questions
on
the
subject
banter
he
met
with
so
grim
a
countenance
that
the
facetious
soon
left
him
to
himself
he
no
longer
drank
that
was
evident
but
his
face
was
pale
thin
and
unwholesome
one
would
have
said
that
just
now
he
was
more
seriously
unhappy
than
he
had
been
throughout
his
boisterous
period
bower
after
one
or
two
glances
at
him
lowered
his
voice
to
say
ca
think
it
altogether
the
right
thing
for
thyrza
trent
to
be
there
every
morning
helping
him
of
course
you
and
me
know
as
it
all
square
but
other
people
might
eh
grail
ought
to
think
of
that
eh
now
it
had
seemed
to
bower
in
his
native
wisdom
that
any
scandal
about
thyrza
would
tickle
ackroyd
immensely
he
imagined
luke
bearing
a
deep
grudge
against
the
girl
and
against
grail
for
he
knew
that
the
friendship
between
luke
and
the
latter
had
plainly
come
to
an
end
in
his
love
of
gossip
he
could
not
keep
the
story
to
himself
and
he
thought
that
ackroyd
would
be
the
safest
of
confidants
in
fact
though
he
spoke
to
butterfield
as
if
he
had
conceived
some
deep
plan
of
rascality
the
man
was
not
capable
of
anything
above
petty
mischief
he
liked
to
pose
in
secret
as
a
sort
of
transpontine
schemer
that
flattered
his
but
his
ambition
did
not
seriously
go
beyond
making
trouble
in
a
legitimate
way
he
did
indeed
believe
that
something
scandalous
was
going
on
and
it
would
be
all
the
better
fun
to
have
ackroyd
join
him
with
malicious
pleasure
in
a
campaign
against
reputations
luke
was
a
radical
of
the
reddest
surely
it
would
delight
him
to
have
a
new
cry
against
the
patronising
capitalist
ackroyd
having
heard
that
whisper
looked
up
from
his
paper
slowly
and
at
once
bower
knew
that
he
had
made
a
great
miscalculation
people
might
think
luke
asked
with
gravity
passing
into
anger
well
you
must
take
it
as
i
meant
it
old
man
bower
was
annoyed
and
added
doubt
egremont
likes
to
have
a
pretty
gyurl
to
talk
to
every
morning
i
do
blame
him
still
if
i
was
grail
the
devil
do
you
mean
bower
what
all
this
about
ackroyd
clearly
knew
nothing
the
other
recovered
some
of
his
confidence
you
need
let
it
go
further
it
no
good
thinking
the
worst
of
people
for
all
i
know
grail
sends
her
to
help
with
the
books
just
because
he
ca
go
himself
luke
laid
down
the
paper
and
said
quietly
you
tell
me
all
about
it
it
the
first
i
heard
what
going
on
bower
brought
out
his
narrative
even
naming
the
authority
for
it
he
took
sips
of
whisky
in
between
ackroyd
heard
in
silence
and
seemed
to
dismiss
his
indignation
nothing
in
all
that
he
said
at
length
course
grail
knows
all
about
it
this
seems
to
have
too
little
to
do
there
no
knowing
you
going
to
tell
this
story
all
over
lambeth
did
i
ask
you
to
keep
it
quiet
bower
you
did
and
i
mean
to
and
look
here
if
you
been
a
man
of
my
own
age
for
all
we
known
each
other
a
goodish
time
i
should
have
sent
you
spinning
half
across
the
room
before
now
so
that
plain
language
and
you
must
make
what
you
like
of
it
therewith
luke
thrust
back
his
chair
and
walked
out
of
the
room
he
did
not
pause
till
he
was
some
distance
from
the
club
his
blood
was
tingling
but
it
was
not
in
anger
that
he
at
length
stood
still
and
asked
himself
whither
he
should
go
his
heart
had
begun
to
sink
with
fear
had
he
done
wisely
in
insulting
bower
the
fellow
would
take
his
revenge
in
an
obvious
way
that
calumny
would
be
in
every
one
mouth
by
the
morrow
and
yet
as
if
that
would
not
have
come
about
in
any
case
how
long
was
anything
likely
to
remain
a
secret
that
was
known
in
bower
shop
no
it
made
no
difference
such
stories
going
round
with
regard
to
thyrza
trent
what
was
the
meaning
of
it
had
there
been
some
imprudence
on
grail
part
some
thoughtlessness
in
keeping
with
his
character
which
had
in
it
so
little
of
the
everyday
man
it
was
a
monstrous
thing
that
opportunities
should
have
been
given
to
that
lying
old
woman
he
walked
on
in
the
direction
of
home
there
was
a
hideous
voice
at
his
ear
suppose
grail
in
truth
knew
nothing
about
those
meetings
in
the
library
how
explain
the
first
of
them
two
months
ago
he
altered
his
course
and
without
settled
purpose
hurried
towards
walnut
tree
walk
as
he
drew
near
to
the
house
he
saw
someone
about
to
enter
he
ran
forward
it
was
gilbert
does
the
library
get
on
he
asked
with
an
abruptness
which
surprised
grail
all
the
carpenter
work
is
finished
books
come
yet
not
yet
he
passed
on
leaving
gilbert
still
in
surprise
for
it
was
perhaps
the
first
word
ackroyd
had
spoken
to
him
concerning
the
library
luke
began
to
run
and
did
not
cease
until
he
was
in
brook
street
in
front
of
the
library
he
tried
to
look
in
at
the
windows
but
found
that
the
blinds
were
drawn
a
policeman
passed
and
scrutinised
him
you
know
whether
any
one
lives
on
these
premises
luke
asked
at
once
he
excited
suspicion
but
after
a
short
dialogue
the
constable
showed
him
the
approach
to
the
caretaker
house
he
knocked
at
the
door
several
times
at
length
it
was
barely
opened
that
mrs
butterfield
what
may
you
want
want
to
know
if
you
please
if
egremont
called
here
and
left
a
message
for
smith
about
some
books
been
here
but
he
left
no
message
he
here
long
the
morning
books
on
the
shelves
you
if
there
was
no
message
it
all
right
luke
went
off
in
kennington
road
he
again
stood
still
he
felt
chilled
and
wretched
to
the
heart
core
thyrza
thyrza
trent
was
it
possible
he
moved
on
this
time
it
was
to
newport
street
ten
had
just
gone
would
totty
be
up
still
whether
or
no
he
must
see
her
he
rang
the
bell
which
was
a
summons
to
her
part
of
the
house
bunce
opened
want
to
see
miss
nancarrow
luke
said
to
him
in
a
low
voice
you
please
knock
at
her
door
i
must
see
her
totty
came
down
immediately
she
had
her
hat
on
and
a
shawl
thrown
about
her
ever
is
it
she
asked
come
a
little
way
off
totty
i
want
to
speak
to
you
she
accompanied
him
to
the
dark
side
of
the
street
and
having
got
her
there
he
could
find
no
fitting
word
with
which
to
begin
he
had
no
intention
of
telling
her
what
he
had
heard
and
what
he
had
discovered
for
himself
but
she
was
a
close
friend
of
thyrza
and
might
know
or
suspect
something
moreover
she
was
a
good
girl
a
girl
thoroughly
to
be
trusted
he
felt
sure
of
her
perhaps
a
hint
would
be
enough
to
induce
her
to
share
a
secret
with
him
when
she
understood
what
his
suspicions
pointed
to
you
frighten
me
what
is
it
you
seen
thyrza
trent
lately
she
tried
to
read
his
face
through
the
darkness
her
conversation
with
thyrza
was
vivid
in
her
mind
suspicion
was
irritated
at
the
sound
of
thyrza
name
on
luke
tongue
i
want
to
ask
you
something
he
spoke
with
deepest
earnestness
taking
her
hand
wo
keep
anything
from
me
now
i
want
to
know
if
thyrza
has
talked
to
you
about
about
her
marriage
do
you
want
to
know
that
the
girl
asked
in
a
hard
voice
speak
plainer
totty
be
a
good
girl
totty
dear
tell
me
what
i
want
to
know
has
she
ever
said
anything
to
make
you
think
that
that
she
liked
any
one
better
than
grail
what
a
coil
was
here
she
had
pulled
her
hand
away
furious
with
him
for
his
shamelessness
yet
did
not
allow
her
to
speak
vehemently
seems
to
me
she
said
better
go
and
ask
her
he
hung
in
doubt
totty
added
with
more
show
of
feeling
trent
a
little
fool
you
may
tell
her
i
said
so
if
you
like
if
you
know
all
about
it
what
do
you
come
bothering
me
for
at
this
time
o
night
i
not
going
to
be
mixed
up
in
such
things
so
i
tell
you
and
there
an
end
of
it
she
left
him
he
stood
and
saw
her
the
house
then
is
was
true
you
know
all
about
it
not
going
to
be
mixed
up
in
such
things
totty
had
been
told
either
by
thyrza
herself
or
by
someone
already
spreading
the
story
the
story
was
true
he
was
struck
with
weakness
sweat
broke
out
from
all
his
body
nothing
he
had
ever
heard
had
seemed
to
him
so
terrible
a
girl
like
thyrza
he
had
held
her
honesty
as
sure
as
the
rising
of
day
out
of
night
half
an
hour
later
he
sat
in
his
bedroom
writing
miss
trent
i
want
very
much
to
see
you
i
will
wait
in
kennington
road
opposite
the
end
of
your
street
from
eight
night
wednesday
please
do
come
i
see
you
and
i
wish
no
one
to
know
of
our
meeting
truly
ackroyd
he
addressed
this
to
lydia
lydia
trent
that
there
might
be
no
mistake
and
went
out
to
post
it
but
at
the
he
altered
his
intention
if
it
was
delivered
by
the
postman
thyrza
would
see
it
it
would
lead
to
questionings
he
determined
to
deliver
it
at
the
hat
factory
in
the
morning
with
his
own
hand
chapter
xxii
left
alone
after
thyrza
second
visit
to
him
in
the
library
egremont
had
no
mind
to
continue
his
task
he
idled
about
for
a
while
read
half
a
page
in
a
volume
he
took
out
of
the
box
at
hazard
then
put
on
his
overcoat
and
went
out
by
the
front
door
which
he
locked
behind
him
with
the
key
he
carried
for
his
own
convenience
he
was
wishing
that
he
had
not
fallen
into
this
piece
of
folly
as
long
as
no
one
but
grail
and
himself
was
concerned
it
mattered
nothing
to
have
established
a
secret
intercourse
with
thyrza
was
a
result
of
his
freak
for
which
he
was
not
at
all
prepared
and
he
could
not
see
his
way
out
of
the
difficulty
he
might
go
and
see
grail
and
let
him
know
what
he
was
doing
but
that
would
involve
deliberate
concealment
of
thyrza
visits
he
could
not
speak
of
them
he
had
no
right
to
do
so
if
thyrza
on
her
part
told
all
about
it
why
that
would
make
it
for
him
still
more
unpleasant
and
thyrza
was
not
likely
to
do
that
he
felt
assured
of
it
precisely
that
meant
that
henceforth
there
would
be
a
secret
understanding
between
himself
and
gilbert
wife
most
certainly
he
desired
nothing
of
the
kind
a
weak
way
of
putting
it
walter
dreaded
anything
of
the
kind
two
days
monday
tuesday
and
in
that
brief
time
the
whole
face
of
the
future
had
changed
for
him
on
sunday
evening
he
had
sat
thinking
over
his
future
relations
with
grail
and
thyrza
the
fact
that
he
consciously
brought
himself
to
reflect
upon
the
subject
of
course
proved
that
it
involved
certain
doubts
and
difficulties
for
him
but
in
half
an
hour
he
believed
that
he
had
put
his
mind
in
order
thyrza
interested
him
why
not
say
it
out
as
he
was
bent
on
understanding
himself
she
interested
him
more
vitally
than
any
girl
he
had
ever
known
very
possibly
he
saw
her
in
the
light
of
illusion
should
his
opportunities
grant
him
a
completer
knowledge
of
her
he
might
not
improbably
discover
that
after
all
she
was
but
a
pretty
girl
of
the
people
attractive
in
a
great
measure
owing
to
her
very
deficiencies
he
would
very
likely
come
to
laugh
at
himself
for
having
thought
that
her
value
was
above
that
of
annabel
newthorpe
but
he
had
to
deal
with
the
present
and
in
the
present
thyrza
seemed
to
him
all
gold
had
there
existed
no
gilbert
grail
he
would
have
been
in
love
with
thyrza
the
plain
truth
but
gilbert
grail
did
exist
and
in
walter
egremont
existed
a
sense
of
honour
a
sense
of
shame
should
he
by
word
or
deed
throw
light
upon
gilbert
grail
future
he
felt
that
all
the
good
of
his
own
life
would
be
at
an
end
he
could
not
face
man
or
woman
again
it
came
to
this
then
henceforth
he
must
remember
that
however
near
his
intimacy
with
gilbert
there
must
be
no
playing
at
friendship
with
gilbert
wife
friendship
was
impossible
that
girl
had
a
power
over
him
which
if
ever
so
slightly
and
thoughtlessly
exercised
might
drive
him
into
acts
of
insanity
he
had
seen
her
three
times
this
is
sunday
night
remember
and
yet
the
thought
of
annabel
was
like
a
pale
ghost
beside
his
thought
of
her
he
had
till
now
suspected
that
his
nature
was
not
framed
for
passion
a
few
weeks
had
taught
him
that
if
he
allowed
passion
to
take
hold
upon
him
no
part
of
his
soul
could
escape
the
flame
two
days
had
passed
since
then
on
two
successive
mornings
he
had
been
alone
with
thyrza
one
evening
he
had
spent
at
a
concert
for
the
mere
sake
of
being
where
thyrza
was
and
feeling
emotions
such
as
he
knew
she
would
feel
playing
at
friendship
with
gilbert
wife
and
he
had
himself
held
out
his
band
to
her
had
asked
her
to
address
him
familiarly
had
talked
of
things
which
brought
them
into
closer
communion
had
yes
had
bidden
her
keep
their
interviews
a
secret
from
gilbert
had
insanity
begun
a
piece
of
folly
nothing
else
as
he
walked
towards
westminster
he
viewed
the
situation
or
tried
to
view
it
as
it
is
put
in
the
second
paragraph
of
this
chapter
he
had
got
into
a
very
disagreeable
position
he
really
must
find
some
becoming
way
out
of
it
thyrza
was
a
silly
girl
to
come
a
second
time
of
course
the
appointment
for
the
following
morning
must
not
be
kept
there
was
no
harm
in
it
all
none
whatever
but
bah
the
worst
had
come
about
the
miserable
fate
had
declared
itself
he
was
in
love
with
thyrza
trent
he
entered
the
abbey
he
seated
himself
in
a
shadowed
place
alone
whose
then
was
the
voice
that
spoke
to
him
unceasingly
and
the
hand
which
he
was
holding
which
stirred
his
blood
so
with
its
warmth
aside
every
thought
of
the
living
fact
say
that
there
is
no
gilbert
grail
in
the
world
you
and
i
you
thyrza
my
my
beautiful
sit
here
side
by
side
and
hold
each
other
hands
your
voice
has
become
very
low
and
reverent
as
befits
the
place
as
befits
the
utterance
of
love
such
as
this
you
say
you
bear
me
what
can
i
answer
you
my
golden
one
only
in
voice
low
as
your
own
breathe
that
the
world
is
barren
but
for
you
that
to
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
i
love
and
worship
you
a
poor
girl
a
worker
with
her
hands
untaught
you
say
that
a
woman
pure
of
soul
with
loveliness
for
your
heritage
with
possibilities
imaginable
in
every
ray
of
your
eyes
in
every
note
of
the
rare
music
of
your
voice
even
so
in
the
meantime
this
happens
to
be
westminster
abbey
where
a
working
man
one
gilbert
grail
has
often
walked
and
sought
solace
from
the
bitterness
of
his
accursed
lot
where
he
has
thought
of
a
young
girl
who
lives
above
him
in
the
house
and
who
as
often
as
she
passes
him
is
like
a
gleam
of
southern
sky
somehow
slipped
into
the
blank
hideousness
of
a
london
winter
hither
he
has
doubtless
come
to
try
and
realise
that
fate
has
been
so
merciful
to
him
that
he
longs
to
thank
some
unknown
deity
and
cry
that
all
is
good
hither
he
will
come
again
with
one
whom
he
calls
his
wife
walter
rose
and
went
forth
went
home
he
had
not
been
ten
minutes
in
his
room
when
a
servant
appeared
to
tell
him
that
a
lady
had
called
and
desired
to
see
him
her
name
ormonde
she
came
in
looking
bright
and
noble
as
ever
giving
him
both
her
hands
am
glad
to
see
you
i
did
not
expect
you
will
you
sit
down
he
did
not
know
what
he
said
ormonde
examined
him
and
for
a
moment
kept
silence
have
come
up
i
have
come
here
direct
from
the
station
because
i
wished
to
make
use
of
you
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
doctor
would
have
been
a
more
fitting
visitor
what
has
come
to
you
walter
is
true
i
am
not
well
but
always
well
enough
to
desire
to
serve
you
not
seemingly
to
bear
in
mind
my
first
wish
why
have
you
not
answered
my
last
letter
as
i
particularly
asked
you
to
if
you
were
ill
why
have
you
remained
here
alone
i
am
angry
with
you
he
was
reflecting
as
absorbedly
as
if
she
had
not
been
in
the
room
she
was
his
friend
if
any
man
had
one
she
was
of
the
priceless
women
who
own
both
heart
and
brain
should
he
speak
out
and
tell
her
everything
if
he
did
so
he
was
saved
he
would
leave
town
grail
should
come
back
after
the
wedding
holiday
and
get
on
with
the
arrangement
of
the
library
under
written
directions
illness
would
explain
such
a
step
in
a
month
all
would
be
right
again
her
eyes
were
searching
him
did
she
half
know
he
had
written
so
foolishly
in
the
letter
about
thyrza
but
it
was
impossible
that
she
could
divine
such
a
thing
the
circumstances
made
it
too
incredible
me
she
went
on
has
caused
your
illness
no
he
could
not
she
would
scorn
him
and
he
could
not
bear
to
sink
in
her
estimation
he
could
not
seem
childish
before
her
have
no
idea
he
answered
i
have
so
accustomed
myself
to
rambling
over
land
and
sea
that
a
year
without
change
is
proving
too
much
for
me
i
must
have
the
library
started
and
then
be
off
anywhere
a
voyage
to
new
zealand
ormonde
showed
disappointment
she
did
not
believe
that
this
was
the
truth
even
as
he
knew
it
the
truth
was
glimmering
in
the
rear
of
her
thoughts
but
she
would
not
allow
it
to
come
forward
in
plain
daylight
it
was
really
difficult
to
entertain
still
as
an
instinct
it
was
there
instinct
supported
even
by
certain
pieces
of
evidence
wish
to
go
away
to
go
a
distance
to
be
away
for
some
time
he
did
not
meet
her
look
do
think
i
shall
get
back
my
health
till
i
do
that
do
let
us
talk
of
it
are
you
doing
at
the
library
up
books
mr
grail
he
does
leave
the
factory
till
the
end
of
the
week
leave
the
place
as
it
stands
and
come
to
eastbourne
with
me
afraid
i
so
am
afraid
she
interrupted
him
gravely
wish
you
to
come
to
eastbourne
i
wish
you
to
not
to
eastbourne
i
have
reasons
her
eyes
fell
i
promise
you
he
continued
i
will
leave
town
i
promise
you
do
think
me
unkind
that
i
refuse
to
come
with
you
i
will
go
to
jersey
again
it
suits
me
i
stay
there
till
grail
comes
back
with
his
wife
and
then
see
if
i
feel
well
enough
to
come
and
go
on
with
the
work
well
ormonde
replied
slowly
you
doubt
my
word
he
asked
moving
forward
to
her
are
not
so
far
as
that
walter
now
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
for
you
she
hesitated
but
only
for
a
moment
wish
you
to
see
bunce
for
me
do
you
meet
him
nowadays
just
now
but
i
can
see
him
any
time
want
to
arrange
if
possible
to
keep
his
child
with
me
for
some
time
for
a
year
or
more
it
is
not
impossible
that
her
disease
might
be
checked
if
she
lived
at
eastbourne
but
in
london
she
will
very
soon
die
i
should
like
to
see
bunce
myself
and
i
thought
you
might
be
able
to
arrange
for
a
meeting
between
us
my
idea
is
this
i
shall
tell
him
that
the
girl
can
make
herself
useful
in
the
house
and
that
i
wish
to
pay
her
for
her
services
the
money
would
of
course
go
to
him
and
he
might
use
it
to
get
help
in
his
home
bessie
the
child
has
explained
to
me
all
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
her
remaining
with
me
they
are
heightened
by
her
father
character
as
you
can
understand
now
do
you
think
he
would
see
me
he
might
come
to
my
hotel
or
he
might
come
here
or
if
he
allows
me
i
would
go
to
him
will
arrange
it
somehow
trust
me
i
will
arrange
it
should
have
said
that
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
as
omnipotent
people
do
on
the
stage
he
laughed
is
no
feeling
miserable
with
you
have
you
not
something
of
that
mesmeric
power
which
draws
one
back
into
health
under
a
touch
a
little
my
children
sometimes
show
astonishing
improvement
when
they
get
fond
of
me
they
talked
of
various
things
but
no
mention
was
made
of
the
newthorpes
by
either
paula
back
yet
ormonde
asked
have
no
idea
i
am
not
likely
ever
to
see
her
again
yes
when
you
come
back
from
new
zealand
i
shall
go
and
see
the
tyrrells
this
afternoon
i
think
i
have
to
dine
with
friends
at
hampstead
when
can
i
have
the
result
of
your
inquiries
will
come
to
you
morning
ten
please
i
have
a
great
deal
to
get
into
the
day
and
you
yourself
must
be
off
by
noon
noon
i
shall
be
this
visit
had
been
happily
timed
sympathy
was
essential
to
egremont
as
often
as
he
suffered
from
the
caprices
of
his
temperament
and
in
grave
trouble
it
was
a
danger
for
him
to
be
left
companionless
he
was
highly
nervous
and
the
tumult
of
his
imagination
affected
his
bodily
state
in
a
degree
uncommon
in
men
though
often
seen
in
delicately
organised
women
when
ormonde
left
him
he
felt
relieved
in
mind
but
physically
so
brought
down
that
he
stretched
himself
upon
the
sofa
he
remained
there
for
more
than
an
hour
how
much
better
he
was
saying
to
himself
not
to
have
told
ormonde
i
that
would
have
been
a
greater
folly
than
anything
yet
no
irreparable
harm
was
as
yet
done
to
confess
a
mere
state
of
mind
would
have
been
to
fill
his
friend
with
fears
wholly
groundless
and
to
fix
a
lasting
torture
in
his
own
memory
it
would
have
been
to
render
impossible
any
future
work
in
lambeth
yet
upon
the
continuance
of
such
work
practically
depended
grail
future
to
gilbert
grail
he
had
solemn
duties
to
perform
henceforth
the
scope
of
his
efforts
would
be
lessened
instead
of
exerting
himself
for
a
vague
populace
it
would
really
be
for
grail
alone
that
he
worked
grail
he
must
and
would
aid
to
the
end
it
was
a
task
worthy
of
a
man
who
was
not
satisfied
with
average
aims
he
would
crush
this
tyrannous
passion
in
his
heart
cost
him
what
struggle
it
might
and
the
reward
would
be
a
noble
one
he
rose
at
length
with
a
haggard
face
it
was
long
past
the
hour
at
which
he
usually
took
his
meal
and
he
had
no
appetite
for
food
he
went
to
a
restaurant
however
and
made
pretence
of
eating
thence
into
the
where
he
spent
the
time
till
five
drinking
coffee
and
reading
papers
his
only
object
now
was
to
kill
time
at
eight
he
was
in
lambeth
he
knew
bunce
address
but
had
never
before
been
in
newport
street
it
was
his
habit
to
discover
places
by
the
aid
of
a
map
alone
and
thus
guided
he
found
the
house
totty
nancarrow
happened
to
be
on
the
stairs
when
he
knocked
she
had
just
come
in
she
ran
down
to
the
door
egremont
inquired
for
bunce
and
was
told
he
was
not
at
home
and
would
not
be
till
very
late
you
know
when
i
could
be
sure
to
find
him
here
replied
totty
who
was
able
to
guess
at
egremont
identity
and
examined
him
with
some
interest
be
here
after
eight
he
on
a
job
in
hammersmith
working
late
but
the
last
day
and
he
sure
to
be
back
by
eight
leaves
early
in
the
morning
i
suppose
five
you
i
will
call
evening
gould
you
let
him
know
that
from
egremont
i
wish
to
see
him
particularly
let
him
know
sir
this
was
a
mishap
it
would
necessitate
another
whole
day
in
london
he
called
upon
ormonde
next
morning
at
the
hotel
which
it
was
her
wont
to
use
when
in
town
for
a
day
or
two
at
first
she
was
strongly
opposed
to
his
waiting
just
on
this
account
can
not
go
till
i
have
done
this
for
you
he
said
firmly
shall
see
bunce
and
go
away
you
must
let
me
have
my
way
in
this
and
he
desired
to
remain
for
a
weightier
reason
than
the
apparent
one
it
was
this
morning
wednesday
that
thyrza
would
expect
to
find
him
at
the
library
she
must
be
disappointed
and
he
would
prove
to
himself
that
he
was
yet
strong
enough
to
resist
that
he
had
not
so
lost
that
his
only
safety
lay
in
flight
the
strength
was
that
of
a
man
who
combats
desperately
with
some
ailment
which
threatens
his
life
i
then
of
those
who
have
no
will
power
will
is
that
whereby
men
raise
themselves
above
the
multitude
let
me
give
proofs
now
that
my
claims
are
not
those
of
a
charlatan
he
passed
six
hours
in
his
room
thyrza
would
go
to
the
library
at
eleven
or
a
little
after
she
was
there
now
she
would
find
the
front
door
closed
against
her
she
would
go
round
to
the
house
and
make
inquiry
of
butterfield
perhaps
she
would
wait
for
him
yes
she
would
wait
for
him
she
was
sitting
in
the
library
on
the
chest
which
he
had
offered
her
for
a
seat
alone
disappointed
disappointed
more
than
that
why
had
she
come
on
tuesday
the
second
morning
why
had
she
desired
to
come
yet
again
had
he
read
her
face
truly
he
knew
he
knew
with
miserable
certainty
that
she
did
not
love
grail
she
had
not
known
what
love
was
a
child
so
merely
a
child
but
when
love
once
was
born
in
her
would
it
not
be
for
life
and
death
he
was
lying
on
the
sofa
again
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ceiling
moisture
stood
upon
his
forehead
formed
into
beads
and
ran
off
his
torment
was
that
of
the
rack
he
believed
that
thyrza
had
at
least
begun
to
love
him
madman
that
he
was
he
it
thyrza
love
was
a
thing
for
which
one
would
dare
uttermost
perdition
the
blind
leap
once
taken
yes
but
that
leap
he
would
not
take
he
was
on
firm
ground
he
knew
what
honour
meant
he
acknowledged
the
sanctity
of
obligations
between
man
and
man
but
if
she
loved
was
it
right
that
she
should
wed
grail
obligations
forsooth
was
it
not
his
first
duty
to
save
her
from
a
terrible
what
could
overrule
love
there
was
time
to
intervene
four
days
more
and
it
would
be
too
late
for
ever
for
ever
what
hideous
things
might
result
from
conscientiousness
such
as
he
was
now
striving
to
preserve
she
is
waiting
there
waiting
for
to
come
to
her
she
trembles
at
every
sound
thinking
it
footstep
if
her
anguish
be
but
the
shadow
of
mine
he
sprang
up
ghastly
he
had
not
closed
his
eyes
through
the
night
but
had
lain
and
walked
about
the
room
in
torment
desire
jealousy
frenzy
of
first
passion
the
first
passion
of
his
life
no
pang
was
spared
him
oh
how
had
it
grown
so
suddenly
he
had
imagined
love
such
as
this
for
some
stately
woman
whose
walk
was
upon
the
heights
of
mind
some
great
artist
some
glorious
sovereign
of
culture
instead
of
that
a
simple
girl
who
lived
by
her
needle
who
spoke
faultily
and
he
loved
her
with
the
love
which
comes
to
a
man
but
once
the
evening
came
at
last
long
before
it
was
really
time
to
start
for
lambeth
on
his
visit
to
bunce
he
began
to
walk
southwards
he
was
at
westminster
bridge
by
seven
probably
it
would
be
useless
to
call
in
newport
street
for
another
hour
he
went
down
on
to
the
lambeth
embankment
it
was
his
hope
that
no
acquaintance
would
pass
this
way
still
blameless
in
fact
he
could
not
help
a
fear
of
being
observed
the
feeling
could
not
have
been
stronger
if
he
had
come
with
the
express
purpose
of
seeking
thyrza
the
air
was
cold
it
blew
at
moments
piercingly
from
the
river
where
the
sun
had
set
there
was
still
a
swarthy
glow
upon
the
clouds
the
gave
a
haggardness
to
the
banks
and
the
bridges
he
walked
at
a
quick
pace
this
way
then
that
workmen
and
women
in
numbers
were
hurrying
in
both
directions
egremont
kept
his
face
towards
the
river
that
he
might
see
no
one
there
was
no
likelihood
that
thyrza
would
pass
if
she
did
if
she
were
alone
and
saw
him
he
knew
she
would
come
up
to
him
and
speak
the
bell
at
westminster
struck
out
the
hour
of
eight
he
turned
off
the
embankment
and
went
on
to
lambeth
bridge
stopping
at
length
to
lean
on
the
parapet
at
the
same
place
where
gilbert
had
stood
and
mused
one
night
when
his
happiness
was
almost
too
great
to
bear
to
egremont
the
darkening
scene
was
in
accord
with
the
wearied
misery
which
made
his
life
one
dull
pain
london
lay
beneath
the
night
like
a
city
of
hopeless
toil
of
aimless
conflict
of
frustration
and
barrenness
his
philosophy
was
a
sham
a
spinning
of
cobwebs
for
idle
hours
when
the
heart
is
restful
and
the
brain
seeks
to
be
amused
he
had
no
more
strength
to
bear
the
torture
of
an
inassuageable
desire
than
any
foolish
fellow
who
knew
not
the
name
of
culture
he
could
not
look
forward
to
the
day
of
forgetting
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
believe
that
he
ever
could
forget
but
it
was
time
now
to
go
on
to
newport
street
in
paradise
street
just
before
the
railway
arch
he
glanced
at
the
bowers
shop
and
dreaded
lest
bower
should
meet
him
but
he
saw
no
one
that
he
knew
before
reaching
bunce
abode
the
landlady
opened
the
door
bunce
was
at
home
and
in
a
moment
came
down
he
returned
his
visitor
greeting
awkwardly
much
wondering
i
have
a
few
words
with
you
egremont
asked
have
come
on
ormonde
behalf
the
lady
at
the
eastbourne
home
you
know
i
have
a
message
about
your
little
girl
happened
bunce
inquired
in
a
startled
voice
no
good
news
if
anything
bunce
did
not
willingly
invite
egremont
into
his
poor
room
but
he
felt
that
he
had
no
choice
he
just
said
you
come
upstairs
sir
and
led
the
way
the
two
children
were
playing
together
on
the
floor
bunce
had
been
on
the
point
of
putting
nelly
to
bed
in
spite
of
his
mood
natural
kindness
so
far
prevailed
with
egremont
that
he
bent
and
touched
the
child
curls
bunce
with
set
lips
stood
watching
he
saw
that
egremont
had
not
so
much
as
cast
an
eye
round
the
room
and
that
together
with
the
attention
to
his
child
softened
his
naturally
suspicious
frame
of
mind
better
than
coming
back
to
an
empty
room
every
night
egremont
said
looking
at
the
man
sir
it
better
though
i
do
always
think
so
two
keep
well
well
never
nothing
the
matter
with
me
exclaimed
young
jack
bluff
though
shamefaced
except
your
grammar
you
mean
jack
replied
his
father
you
just
sit
down
sir
i
was
afraid
at
first
there
was
something
wrong
when
you
mentioned
mrs
ormonde
egremont
reassured
him
and
went
on
to
say
that
ormonde
was
anxious
to
see
him
personally
whilst
she
was
in
town
he
felt
it
would
be
better
not
to
explain
the
nature
of
the
proposal
ormonde
was
going
to
make
and
affected
to
know
nothing
more
than
that
she
wished
to
speak
of
the
child
health
bunce
had
knitted
his
brows
his
heavy
lips
took
on
a
fretful
sullenness
he
knew
that
it
was
impossible
to
meet
egremont
with
flat
refusals
and
the
prospect
of
being
driven
into
something
he
intensely
disliked
worked
him
into
an
inward
fume
he
gave
a
great
scrape
on
the
floor
with
one
of
his
heels
as
if
he
would
have
ploughed
a
track
in
the
boards
sorry
he
began
got
no
free
time
worth
speaking
of
much
obliged
to
the
lady
but
i
do
see
how
i
to
he
wanted
to
blunder
out
words
of
angry
impatience
his
rising
choler
brought
him
to
a
full
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
sentence
egremont
addressed
himself
in
earnest
to
the
task
persuasion
more
was
involved
than
mere
benefit
to
the
child
health
it
was
easy
to
see
that
bunce
position
was
a
miserable
one
and
ormonde
if
once
she
could
establish
direct
relations
with
the
man
would
doubtless
find
many
a
little
way
of
being
useful
to
him
he
put
it
at
length
as
a
personal
favour
bunce
again
ploughed
the
floor
then
blurted
out

egremont
i
not
one
to
talk
to
ladies
as
you
can
see
yourself
but
i
ca
help
that
i
shall
have
to
go
as
i
am
ormonde
will
gladly
come
here
if
you
will
let
her
rather
not
if
you
do
mind
sir
it
will
be
simplest
if
you
go
to
my
rooms
in
great
russell
street
just
by
the
british
museum
i
leave
town
tomorrow
ormonde
will
be
quite
alone
to
meet
you
could
you
be
there
at
nine
the
appointment
was
made
egremont
leaving
one
of
his
cards
to
insure
recollection
of
the
address
then
he
spoke
a
word
or
two
to
the
children
and
bunce
led
him
down
to
the
door
they
shook
hands
shall
see
you
at
the
library
soon
i
hope
egremont
said
must
give
me
your
best
help
in
making
it
known
the
words
sounded
so
hollow
in
his
own
ears
that
as
he
turned
to
go
along
the
dark
street
he
could
have
laughed
at
himself
scornfully
as
bunce
reascended
someone
met
and
passed
him
hurrying
with
light
feet
and
woman
garments
silently
you
miss
nancarrow
he
asked
for
there
was
no
light
on
the
staircase
came
a
muffled
reply
nancarrow
is
in
it
was
the
voice
of
thyrza
trent
bunce
did
not
recognise
it
for
he
knew
her
too
slightly
she
had
come
to
the
house
not
long
before
egremont
after
a
day
of
suffering
she
wished
to
speak
with
totty
totty
was
the
only
one
to
whom
she
speak
now
gilbert
her
own
lyddy
them
she
dreaded
notwithstanding
the
terms
on
which
she
had
parted
with
her
friend
on
monday
night
she
felt
an
irresistible
need
of
seeing
her
it
was
one
way
moreover
of
passing
a
part
of
the
evening
away
from
walnut
tree
walk
but
totty
was
out
had
not
yet
come
home
since
her
work
thyrza
said
she
would
go
upstairs
and
wait
she
did
so
totty
room
was
dark
and
of
course
fireless
but
she
cared
neither
for
the
darkness
nor
the
cold
she
groped
her
way
to
a
chair
and
sat
very
still
it
was
a
blessed
relief
to
be
here
to
be
safe
from
gilbert
and
lyddy
for
ever
so
short
a
time
to
sit
and
clasp
the
darkness
like
something
loved
she
was
making
up
her
mind
to
tell
totty
everything
someone
she
must
tell
someone
not
lyddy
that
would
be
terrible
but
totty
had
a
kind
heart
and
would
keep
the
secret
perchance
could
advise
in
some
way
though
what
advice
could
anyone
give
what
voice
was
that
she
had
heard
someone
knock
at
bunce
door
then
heard
bunce
go
down
he
was
coming
up
again
and
someone
with
him
someone
who
spoke
in
a
voice
which
made
her
heart
leap
she
sprang
to
the
door
to
listen
bunce
and
his
companion
entered
the
opposite
room
and
shut
themselves
in
thyrza
opened
her
door
as
softly
as
possible
leaned
forward
listened
yes
it
was
voice
what
was
he
doing
here
he
had
not
come
to
the
library
had
not
kept
his
promise
was
it
not
a
promise
to
her
he
had
said
that
she
should
see
him
again
should
be
in
the
room
alone
with
him
talk
with
him
for
one
hour
one
poor
short
hour
and
in
the
end
it
was
denied
why
did
he
come
to
see
bunce
but
he
was
well
nothing
had
happened
to
him
which
all
day
had
been
her
dread
she
would
not
try
to
overhear
their
conversation
enough
that
he
was
safe
in
that
next
room
never
mind
for
what
purpose
he
came
she
was
near
to
him
again
she
threw
up
her
hands
against
the
door
and
leaned
her
face
her
bosom
on
it
her
throat
was
so
dry
that
she
felt
choking
her
heart
poor
heart
could
it
bear
this
incessant
throbbing
pain
she
swallowed
tears
and
had
some
little
bodily
solace
but
if
totty
should
come
she
hoped
to
be
alone
as
long
as
he
was
there
it
was
so
sweet
to
be
near
him
and
alone
and
totty
did
not
come
of
a
sudden
the
opposite
door
opened
he
was
leaving
going
forth
again
she
knew
not
whither
only
that
it
was
away
from
her
then
desire
became
act
she
heard
the
close
and
on
the
moment
sped
from
the
room
she
scarcely
knew
what
she
said
to
bunce
on
the
stairs
now
she
was
in
the
street
which
way
there
he
was
there
at
but
a
little
distance
but
she
must
not
approach
him
here
in
this
street
any
moment
totty
might
come
one
of
the
bowers
might
pass
she
kept
at
an
even
remoteness
following
him
into
paradise
street
into
high
street
out
into
lambeth
road
with
the
bridge
in
sight
he
meant
to
go
along
the
embankment
but
it
was
quieter
here
a
quickened
step
almost
a
run
and
she
was
by
his
side
egremont
he
stood
egremont
i
thought
it
was
you
i
wanted
they
were
under
the
church
as
thyrza
spoke
the
bells
suddenly
broke
out
with
their
harsh
clanging
they
had
been
ringing
for
the
last
twenty
minutes
and
were
now
recommencing
after
a
pause
egremont
glanced
towards
the
tower
startled
and
seemingly
annoyed
very
sorry
i
could
come
to
the
library
this
morning
miss
trent
he
said
very
formally
was
unexpectedly
kept
away
what
automaton
had
taken
his
place
and
spoke
in
this
contemptible
tone
of
conventional
politeness
bells
are
so
loud
thyrza
said
complainingly
wanted
to
to
ask
you
something
may
i
go
with
you
a
little
further
just
to
the
bridge
he
said
nothing
but
looked
at
her
and
walked
on
they
entered
the
bridge
egremont
still
advanced
and
thyrza
kept
by
him
till
they
were
nearly
on
the
westminster
side
of
the
river
very
few
people
passed
them
and
no
vehicles
disturbed
the
quiet
of
the
dark
road
along
the
waterside
on
the
one
hand
was
a
black
mass
of
wharfs
a
few
barges
moored
in
front
on
the
other
at
a
little
distance
the
gloomy
shape
of
millbank
prison
the
jangle
of
the
bells
was
softened
certainly
might
be
more
musical
egremont
said
with
a
forced
laugh
should
not
care
to
live
in
one
of
the
houses
just
under
the
church
she
was
speaking
waited
this
morning
oh
it
did
matter
but
i
was
afraid
i
thought
you
might
have
had
some
accident
mr
egremont
it
was
business
that
prevented
me
from
coming
but
you
wish
to
ask
me
something
miss
trent
you
will
be
there
that
was
all
i
like
helping
i
like
looking
at
the
books
and
putting
them
up
if
you
would
let
me
the
nearest
lamp
showed
him
her
face
what
held
him
from
making
that
pale
loveliness
his
own
his
heart
throbbed
as
terribly
as
hers
he
with
difficulty
heard
when
she
spoke
so
loud
was
the
rush
of
blood
in
his
ears
but
he
had
begun
the
fight
with
himself
he
could
not
turn
away
abruptly
and
leave
her
standing
there
if
the
victory
were
to
be
won
it
must
be
by
sheer
wrestle
with
the
temptation
for
her
sake
as
well
as
his
own
to
let
her
so
much
as
suspect
his
feeling
were
as
bad
as
to
utter
it
nay
infinitely
worse
for
it
would
mean
that
he
must
not
see
her
after
he
and
she
would
then
be
each
other
peril
in
a
far
direr
sense
than
now
he
replied
to
her
so
sorry
i
shall
not
be
there
i
have
to
go
out
of
london
he
looked
her
in
the
face
unwaveringly
it
was
the
look
which
tormented
her
not
that
which
she
yearned
for
she
could
not
move
away
her
eyes
are
going
away
mr
egremont
i
am
going
out
of
england
for
a
week
or
two
perhaps
for
longer
it
was
wrong
all
wrong
in
spite
of
himself
he
could
not
but
admit
a
note
of
pathos
the
automatic
voice
of
politeness
would
not
come
at
his
bidding
he
should
have
left
her
on
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
where
the
harsh
bells
allowed
no
delicacies
of
tone
france
she
asked
to
an
island
very
near
france
i
must
not
keep
you
standing
here
miss
trent
it
is
very
cold
yes
the
wind
was
cold
but
perspiration
covered
his
face
only
a
minute
may
i
go
to
the
library
and
do
some
more
of
the
books
are
they
all
finished
there
still
one
case
of
them
and
more
will
be
coming
certainly
you
may
go
there
if
you
wish
her
voice
fell
i
sha
know
how
to
put
them
no
i
ca
do
it
alone
shall
write
to
grail
and
tell
him
what
i
have
been
doing
you
can
help
him
the
monosyllable
fell
from
her
like
a
whisper
of
despair
but
the
utterance
of
grail
name
had
brought
egremont
the
last
impulse
he
needed
i
come
back
he
said
shall
find
you
in
your
new
home
as
i
sha
see
you
again
let
me
say
now
how
much
i
hope
that
you
will
live
there
a
long
time
and
very
happily
miss
trent
surely
that
was
formal
and
automatic
enough
not
one
more
word
not
one
more
glance
at
her
face
he
had
touched
her
hand
had
raised
his
hat
was
gone
she
stood
gazing
after
him
until
in
a
minute
or
two
he
was
lost
in
the
dark
street
behind
the
wharfs
so
suddenly
he
had
scarcely
said
so
poor
a
she
had
vexed
him
with
her
importunities
he
wished
to
show
her
that
she
had
not
behaved
in
the
way
that
pleased
him
scarcely
a
she
went
to
the
end
of
the
bridge
and
there
crept
into
a
dark
place
whither
no
eye
could
follow
her
her
strength
was
at
an
end
she
fell
to
her
knees
her
head
lay
against
something
hard
and
cold
a
sob
convulsed
her
and
then
in
the
very
anguish
of
desolation
she
wept
the
darkness
folded
her
she
could
lie
here
on
the
ground
and
abandon
herself
to
misery
she
wept
her
soul
from
her
eyes
but
for
egremont
the
struggle
was
not
over
he
had
scarcely
passed
out
of
her
sight
when
fear
held
his
steps
thyrza
must
not
be
left
there
alone
that
face
of
hers
looking
like
marble
threatened
despair
how
could
he
leave
her
so
far
from
home
in
the
night
by
the
river
he
went
back
he
knew
what
such
return
meant
it
was
defeat
after
all
he
knew
what
his
first
word
to
her
would
be
he
sought
her
now
sought
her
that
she
might
never
leave
him
again
the
flood
of
passion
was
too
strong
that
moment
of
supreme
restraint
had
but
massed
the
waters
into
overwhelming
power
it
was
the
thought
of
danger
to
her
that
had
ended
all
pity
for
gilbert
she
was
not
in
sight
could
she
have
passed
the
bridge
so
quickly
he
ran
forward
true
it
must
be
more
than
five
minutes
since
he
had
left
her
much
more
perhaps
for
he
could
not
judge
how
long
he
had
stood
battling
with
himself
behind
the
wharfs
a
policeman
stood
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
egremont
asked
him
if
a
young
girl
had
just
passed
yes
such
a
one
had
gone
by
a
minute
or
two
ago
he
ran
on
past
the
church
into
high
street
but
would
she
go
this
way
a
girl
crossed
the
road
a
little
way
ahead
into
paradise
street
he
overtook
her
only
to
be
disappointed
at
the
end
of
newport
street
a
man
stood
waiting
it
was
gilbert
grail
he
had
come
in
the
hope
of
meeting
thyrza
who
lydia
had
told
him
was
gone
to
see
totty
nancarrow
he
was
greatly
anxious
about
her
egremont
coming
up
at
a
swift
pace
recognised
gilbert
and
stopped
they
shook
hands
grail
was
silent
egremont
began
to
stammer
words
he
had
been
to
see
bunce
just
now
for
such
and
such
reasons
with
such
and
such
results
but
he
could
not
stop
he
had
an
engagement
the
shame
of
it
he
found
himself
in
lambeth
walk
no
longer
searching
anxious
only
to
get
away
from
the
sight
of
men
thyrza
must
be
home
by
this
time
that
speech
with
gilbert
had
chilled
him
and
now
he
was
hot
with
he
made
his
way
out
into
westminster
bridge
road
thence
walked
to
his
own
part
of
the
town
chapter
xxiii
confession
this
wednesday
morning
lydia
went
to
her
work
reluctantly
thyrza
was
so
strange
it
looked
as
if
she
was
going
to
have
an
illness
again
there
had
been
a
night
of
sleeplessness
if
the
girl
fell
for
a
moment
into
slumber
she
broke
from
it
with
an
inarticulate
cry
as
if
of
fear
it
was
now
nearly
a
week
since
thyrza
had
really
slept
through
the
night
but
it
was
growing
worse
she
was
feverish
she
muttered
so
that
lydia
was
terrified
lest
she
had
become
delirious
and
there
was
no
explaining
it
all
the
excitement
of
the
concert
surely
could
not
have
such
lasting
results
indeed
thyrza
seemed
no
longer
to
give
a
thought
to
the
music
all
she
begged
for
was
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
remain
alone
she
did
not
wish
grail
to
come
up
to
the
room
she
said
she
would
go
out
in
the
course
of
the
morning
and
that
would
do
her
good
so
lydia
went
forth
reluctantly
at
the
entrance
to
the
factory
she
met
totty
nancarrow
they
just
gave
each
other
a
totty
seemed
dull
she
did
not
run
up
the
stairs
as
usual
but
walked
with
a
tired
step
lydia
following
her
broke
her
habit
and
spoke
is
at
all
well
she
said
the
other
without
turning
her
head
and
in
a
tone
of
little
interest
lydia
bit
her
lip
vexed
that
she
had
said
anything
they
came
into
the
there
were
a
number
of
tables
at
which
girls
and
women
were
beginning
to
seat
themselves
a
portion
of
the
room
was
divided
off
by
a
glass
partition
and
within
the
little
office
thus
formed
sat
the
surrounded
with
felt
hats
some
finished
some
waiting
for
the
needle
to
line
them
and
put
the
band
on
sitting
here
she
overlooked
the
workers
some
fifty
when
all
were
assembled
there
was
much
buzzing
and
tittering
and
laughing
aloud
all
belonged
to
the
class
of
needlewomen
who
preserve
appearances
many
of
them
were
becomingly
dressed
and
none
betrayed
extreme
poverty
probably
a
fourth
came
from
homes
in
which
they
were
not
the
only
and
would
not
starve
if
work
slackened
now
and
then
having
fathers
or
brothers
to
help
them
whether
they
liked
coming
to
work
or
not
all
showed
much
cheerfulness
at
the
commencement
of
the
day
they
greeted
each
other
pleasantly
sometimes
affectionately
and
not
one
who
lacked
a
story
of
personal
incident
to
be
quickly
related
to
a
friend
whilst
the
work
was
being
given
out
so
much
seemed
to
happen
in
the
hours
of
freedom
lydia
was
much
quieter
than
usual
it
was
not
her
wont
to
gossip
of
her
own
affairs
or
to
pry
into
the
secrets
of
her
acquaintances
but
with
the
little
group
of
those
with
whom
she
was
intimate
she
had
generally
some
piece
of
merriment
to
share
always
marked
by
kindness
of
feeling
she
was
a
favourite
with
the
most
sensible
girls
of
her
own
age
thyrza
had
never
been
exactly
a
favourite
though
some
older
than
herself
always
used
to
pet
her
generally
causing
her
annoyance
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
passed
and
work
was
getting
into
trim
when
a
girl
a
late
arrival
in
coming
to
her
place
handed
lydia
a
letter
downstairs
asked
me
to
give
it
you
she
whispered
need
blush
you
know
lydia
was
too
surprised
to
manifest
any
such
she
murmured
thanks
and
looked
at
the
address
it
was
a
man
writing
but
she
had
no
idea
whose
she
opened
the
envelope
and
found
short
note
what
did
this
mean
it
at
once
flashed
across
lydia
mind
that
there
might
be
some
connection
between
this
and
thyrza
strange
disorder
old
habit
still
brought
ackroyd
and
thyrza
together
in
her
thoughts
yet
how
was
it
possible
ackroyd
was
engaged
to
totty
nancarrow
and
thyrza
had
never
shown
the
least
interest
when
she
mentioned
him
of
late
was
he
going
to
make
trouble
now
at
the
last
moment
when
everything
seemed
to
have
taken
the
final
form
since
thyrza
engagement
to
gilbert
there
was
no
longer
need
of
subtle
but
though
she
might
now
freely
think
of
him
lydia
soon
found
that
ackroyd
was
not
the
same
in
her
eyes
the
first
rumours
of
his
abandonment
to
vulgar
dissipation
she
utterly
refused
to
credit
but
before
long
she
had
to
believe
them
in
spite
of
herself
she
saw
him
one
night
coming
out
of
a
singing
a
drunken
song
it
was
a
terrible
blow
to
her
she
had
to
question
herself
much
and
to
make
great
efforts
to
understand
a
man
nature
she
had
thought
him
incapable
of
such
things
the
vague
stories
of
earlier
wildness
she
had
held
no
account
of
when
a
woman
says
that
is
past
she
means
does
not
exist
and
never
did
exist
it
surprised
her
that
she
still
thought
of
him
with
heartache
her
quarrel
with
mary
bower
seemed
an
encouragement
to
the
love
she
kept
so
secret
she
found
a
thousand
excuses
for
him
she
pitied
him
deeply
she
longed
to
go
and
speak
to
him
why
could
she
not
do
so
often
and
often
she
rehearsed
conversations
with
him
in
which
she
told
him
how
unworthy
it
was
to
fall
so
and
implored
him
for
his
own
sake
to
be
a
man
again
she
might
have
realised
such
a
dialogue
though
it
would
have
cost
her
much
but
for
the
news
that
he
had
begun
to
pay
attention
to
totty
nancarrow
then
she
knew
jealousy
of
thyrza
she
could
not
be
jealous
but
to
imagine
him
giving
his
affection
to
a
girl
like
totty
nancarrow
made
her
rebellious
and
scornful
how
little
could
any
of
her
companions
know
what
was
passing
in
lydia
breast
when
she
had
one
of
her
days
of
quietness
and
bent
with
such
persistence
over
her
sewing
if
spoken
to
she
raised
the
same
kind
helpful
face
as
ever
you
could
not
imagine
that
a
minute
ago
a
tear
had
all
but
come
to
her
eyes
that
in
thought
she
had
been
uttering
words
of
indignant
passion
they
were
rare
those
days
in
which
she
could
not
be
quite
herself
it
was
not
her
nature
to
yield
when
weakness
tempted
and
now
he
had
written
to
her
having
read
the
note
she
put
it
into
the
bosom
of
her
dress
and
whilst
her
fingers
were
busy
she
turned
over
every
possible
explanation
in
her
mind
she
knew
that
he
had
abandoned
his
evil
habits
of
late
and
she
could
be
just
enough
not
to
refuse
totty
some
credit
for
the
change
gilbert
himself
had
said
that
the
girl
influence
seemed
on
the
whole
good
but
some
mystery
was
now
going
to
reveal
itself
it
concerned
thyrza
she
was
sure
it
did
the
fact
that
the
note
was
delivered
in
this
way
and
the
request
for
secrecy
which
it
contained
made
this
certain
at
and
again
in
the
evening
thyrza
was
still
in
the
same
state
of
depression
and
feverishness
lydia
said
nothing
of
the
business
which
would
take
her
out
at
eight
when
the
time
came
and
she
had
to
make
an
excuse
thyrza
said
that
she
too
would
go
out
she
wanted
to
see
totty
tell
gilbert
lydia
replied
afraid
to
make
any
opposition
herself
he
say
it
was
good
for
me
to
go
out
and
i
want
to
go
you
wo
say
anything
lyddy
ought
to
dear
you
not
well
enough
to
go
that
quite
certain
wo
be
long
i
must
go
just
for
half
an
hour
do
you
want
to
see
her
lydia
asked
masking
her
curiosity
with
a
tone
nothing
to
explain
i
feel
i
want
to
talk
that
all
from
time
to
time
in
her
more
difficult
moments
lydia
had
felt
a
little
hurt
that
the
course
of
circumstances
made
no
difference
in
thyrza
friendship
for
totty
when
her
truer
mind
was
restored
she
knew
that
the
reproach
was
a
foolish
one
more
likely
it
was
she
herself
who
was
to
blame
for
having
always
nourished
a
prejudice
against
totty
at
present
thyrza
anxiety
to
go
out
was
another
detail
connecting
itself
with
ackroyd
summons
something
unexplained
was
in
progress
between
those
three
totty
and
ackroyd
and
thyrza
her
resentment
against
the
first
of
them
revived
she
would
soon
know
what
it
all
meant
thyrza
and
she
left
the
house
together
and
went
in
opposite
directions
lydia
crossed
kennington
road
and
found
luke
waiting
for
her
she
approached
him
with
veiled
eyes
so
glad
you
come
he
began
with
signs
of
disturbance
kind
of
you
to
come
i
have
a
great
deal
to
say
and
i
ca
speak
here
will
you
come
round
into
walcot
square
it
be
quieter
she
said
nothing
but
walked
beside
him
it
was
a
new
and
strange
sensation
to
be
thus
accompanying
ackroyd
she
was
conscious
that
her
pulses
quickened
they
went
on
in
silence
till
they
reached
the
spot
which
luke
had
mentioned
an
irregular
little
square
without
traffic
dark
do
know
how
to
begin
to
tell
you
miss
trent
ackroyd
said
when
he
stopped
and
turned
towards
her
your
sister
i
have
to
speak
about
she
had
foreseen
truly
her
heart
sank
can
you
have
to
say
about
my
sister
mr
ackroyd
she
asked
in
a
hard
voice
not
surprised
that
you
speak
in
that
way
i
know
that
i
shall
seem
a
busybody
or
perhaps
something
worse
meddling
with
things
that
concern
me
it
would
be
easier
for
me
to
leave
it
alone
but
i
do
that
because
i
ca
think
of
you
and
your
sister
as
strangers
i
heard
something
said
about
thyrza
that
you
ought
to
know
be
friendly
to
me
and
believe
i
only
telling
you
this
because
i
think
it
my
duty
lydia
was
looking
at
him
in
astonishment
heard
something
what
what
has
anybody
to
say
about
my
sister
shall
make
no
secret
of
anything
it
the
only
way
to
prove
behaving
honestly
to
you
i
was
at
the
club
last
night
and
bower
came
and
sat
down
by
me
and
he
began
to
talk
about
thyrza
he
said
it
looked
strange
that
she
should
be
alone
with
egremont
in
the
library
every
morning
the
woman
that
takes
care
of
the
place
told
him
about
it
and
he
seen
thyrza
himself
coming
away
at
when
egremont
was
there
he
says
she
goes
to
help
him
to
put
books
on
the
shelves
he
spoke
of
it
in
a
way
that
showed
he
was
telling
the
story
to
all
sorts
of
people
and
in
a
way
that
means
harm
i
sooner
bite
my
tongue
out
than
repeat
such
things
about
your
sister
if
it
was
that
you
ought
to
know
i
might
have
told
grail
but
i
felt
it
was
better
to
see
you
first
i
know
i
making
trouble
enough
any
way
but
i
believe
you
will
give
me
credit
for
acting
honestly
do
think
of
me
as
the
kind
of
man
i
seemed
since
christmas
you
used
to
think
well
of
me
and
you
must
do
so
now
miss
trent
i
speaking
as
a
true
friend
he
hurried
out
his
words
of
for
he
saw
the
anger
in
her
face
you
believe
this
lydia
exclaimed
when
she
could
use
her
voice
believe
a
man
that
will
go
saying
things
like
this
about
my
sister
why
is
he
trying
to
do
us
harm
why
there
no
books
to
put
on
the
shelves
no
books
have
come
to
the
library
yet
she
laughed
scornfully
and
before
he
could
speak
continued
with
the
same
vehemence
have
we
done
to
bower
i
suppose
it
because
we
not
so
friendly
with
them
as
we
were
so
he
does
his
best
to
take
away
our
good
name
and
to
ruin
thyrza
life
of
course
i
knew
very
well
what
you
mean
i
know
what
means
he
a
cruel
coward
it
a
lie
that
he
seen
thyrza
coming
out
of
the
library
why
i
tell
you
there
is
no
books
there
how
could
she
help
to
put
them
on
the
shelves
you
shall
come
with
me
this
minute
to
the
bowers
house
you
ca
refuse
to
do
that
ackroyd
it
only
fair
it
only
justice
you
shall
come
and
repeat
to
them
all
you
told
me
and
then
see
if
he
to
say
it
again
i
glad
you
did
tell
gilbert
you
was
right
to
tell
me
first
i
not
angry
with
you
you
must
think
that
though
you
speak
as
if
you
believed
his
lies
i
should
have
thought
you
knew
thyrza
better
come
with
me
this
minute
you
come
if
an
honest
man
as
you
say
you
are
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
ackroyd
took
the
hand
and
held
it
whilst
he
compelled
her
to
listen
to
him
we
ca
go
till
you
heard
everything
i
got
more
to
tell
you
what
is
it
a
man
that
say
so
much
say
anything
told
me
quite
enough
i
should
think
considering
it
about
my
own
sister
lydia
do
listen
to
me
my
poor
girl
try
and
quiet
yourself
and
listen
to
me
there
nothing
more
of
bower
telling
he
did
say
any
more
and
there
was
more
harm
in
his
way
of
telling
it
than
in
the
story
itself
but
i
have
something
to
tell
you
that
i
found
out
myself
she
looked
him
in
the
face
her
hand
she
had
drawn
away
are
going
to
say
harm
of
thyrza
she
said
under
her
breath
eyeing
him
as
though
he
were
her
deadliest
enemy
and
say
of
me
what
you
like
lydia
i
got
something
that
i
must
tell
you
if
i
do
i
a
deal
better
never
have
said
anything
at
all
you
not
right
about
the
library
there
books
there
and
egremont
has
been
busy
with
them
of
a
morning
how
can
know
better
than
gilbert
she
cried
know
because
i
went
last
night
to
find
out
as
soon
as
i
heard
bower
tale
i
went
and
i
was
there
again
at
and
i
saw
your
sister
come
out
of
the
door
she
was
silent
in
spite
of
her
passionate
exclamations
a
suspicion
had
whispered
within
her
from
the
first
a
voice
to
which
she
would
lend
no
ear
now
she
was
constrained
to
think
she
remembered
lateness
at
dinner
on
monday
she
remembered
that
thyrza
had
been
from
home
each
morning
this
week
and
if
it
were
true
that
books
had
arrived
at
the
library
and
that
gilbert
knew
nothing
of
it
was
the
explanation
of
thyrza
illness
of
her
inexplicable
agitations
of
her
sleeplessness
she
could
not
raise
her
head
ackroyd
too
kept
silent
she
asked
at
length
you
anything
more
to
tell
me
i
something
more
it
another
thing
that
i
found
out
last
night
after
leaving
bower
say
that
you
do
accuse
me
of
conduct
as
bad
as
bower
he
added
vehemently
tell
you
everything
and
it
makes
me
seem
as
if
i
told
it
for
the
sake
of
telling
say
you
believe
in
my
honesty
at
all
events
do
accuse
you
of
anything
she
replied
still
under
her
breath
is
it
you
have
to
say
went
to
see
miss
nancarrow
i
had
no
thought
of
repeating
the
story
to
her
you
must
believe
me
or
not
as
you
like
but
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
i
wanted
to
see
if
she
had
heard
anything
from
the
bowers
and
i
wanted
to
try
and
find
out
if
i
could
whether
thyrza
had
told
her
any
secret
it
was
out
of
a
wish
to
pry
into
things
i
no
concern
with
but
because
i
felt
afraid
for
thyrza
and
because
i
wanted
to
be
sure
that
there
was
sufficient
reason
for
it
before
i
came
to
you
to
put
you
on
your
guard
i
said
to
totty
you
any
reason
to
think
that
thyrza
cares
for
somebody
else
more
than
for
grail
she
got
angry
at
once
and
said
she
knew
all
about
it
that
she
no
patience
with
thyrza
and
that
she
was
going
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
the
affair
i
told
you
plainly
lydia
told
you
everything
i
hope
i
done
it
for
the
best
she
stood
as
if
she
heard
nothing
her
arms
hung
down
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
she
was
thinking
that
now
she
understood
urgency
in
wishing
to
see
totty
now
she
understood
everything
she
moved
as
if
to
go
away
ackroyd
could
find
no
word
all
he
had
to
say
was
so
much
sheer
cruelty
and
to
attempt
comfort
would
be
insult
but
lydia
faced
him
again
you
think
the
worst
of
my
sister
again
her
look
was
defiant
she
had
no
enemy
in
the
world
like
the
man
who
could
accuse
thyrza
of
guilt
it
was
one
thing
to
point
out
that
thyrza
was
in
danger
of
being
columniated
another
to
believe
that
the
evil
judgment
was
merited
think
the
worst
of
her
lydia
he
replied
firmly
think
it
likely
that
she
has
been
doing
something
very
thoughtless
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
that
man
egremont
has
been
doing
something
for
which
he
deserves
to
be
thrashed
but
no
more
than
that
more
than
that
i
believe
you
ackroyd
a
minute
ago
i
hated
you
now
i
know
that
i
have
always
been
right
in
thinking
you
had
a
good
heart
thyrza
may
have
been
foolish
in
keeping
things
from
me
but
she
no
more
to
blame
than
that
you
can
believe
me
i
would
say
it
if
it
was
my
life
or
death
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
you
think
bower
is
telling
everyone
she
asked
her
voice
wonderfully
changed
for
all
at
once
she
became
a
woman
and
felt
her
need
of
a
strong
man
aid
afraid
so
when
he
done
his
tale
to
me
last
night
i
told
him
that
if
he
had
been
a
man
so
much
older
than
myself
i
have
struck
him
in
face
of
all
in
the
club
i
perhaps
better
not
have
angered
him
but
it
would
make
much
difference
he
got
ill
feeling
against
egremont
i
believe
lydia
eyes
flashed
when
she
heard
of
that
speech
to
bower
you
think
he
doing
this
more
to
harm
egremont
than
thyrza
do
he
a
gossiping
fool
but
i
do
believe
he
plot
to
ruin
a
girl
in
this
way
still
i
quite
sure
the
story
have
got
about
and
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
both
stood
in
thought
lydia
felt
as
if
all
the
bright
future
were
blasted
before
her
eyes
thyrza
loved
egremont
egremont
was
the
falsest
of
friends
to
gilbert
the
most
treacherous
of
men
her
darling
had
been
artfully
drawn
by
him
into
this
secret
intercourse
and
how
was
it
all
to
end
must
go
home
to
thyrza
ackroyd
i
do
know
what
to
do
but
it
will
come
to
me
when
i
see
my
sister
she
reflected
a
moment
then
added
went
to
see
totty
nancarrow
at
the
same
time
when
i
came
out
perhaps
she
be
there
still
if
i
do
find
her
at
home
i
must
go
to
the
other
house
do
wish
i
could
be
some
help
to
you
lydia
he
said
holding
her
hand
and
looking
very
kindly
at
her
ca
nobody
can
help
whatever
happens
thyrza
and
me
will
be
together
and
i
shall
keep
her
from
harm
but
you
been
a
good
friend
to
me
ackroyd
i
ca
do
more
than
say
i
grateful
to
you
i
shall
be
that
as
long
as
i
live
i
do
want
to
pry
into
anything
between
you
and
your
sister
but
if
i
do
anything
to
be
of
use
to
her
or
to
you
you
tell
me
you
could
easily
send
a
message
to
me
you
i
ask
you
if
there
is
anything
let
me
go
home
alone
mr
ackroyd
she
came
to
the
house
and
saw
that
there
was
no
light
in
the
window
of
their
room
still
thyrza
might
be
sitting
there
she
ran
upstairs
the
room
was
vacant
then
she
hurried
to
newport
street
ladds
told
her
that
totty
had
not
come
in
yet
and
that
thyrza
had
been
and
was
gone
away
again
she
turned
on
her
steps
slowly
and
after
a
short
uncertainty
went
home
again
in
the
hope
that
thyrza
might
have
returned
as
she
entered
gilbert
met
her
in
the
passage
thyrza
come
back
she
asked
she
is
in
the
house
where
did
she
go
to
went
just
to
see
totty
nancarrow
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
concealing
this
now
been
there
but
she
gone
away
i
dare
say
she
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
lydia
went
upstairs
not
feeling
able
to
talk
gilbert
who
since
monday
had
fallen
into
ever
deeper
trouble
left
the
house
and
walked
towards
newport
street
hoping
to
find
thyrza
it
was
thus
that
he
came
to
be
met
by
egremont
he
was
back
in
half
an
hour
lydia
came
down
when
she
heard
him
enter
he
said
gravely
should
have
allowed
her
to
go
out
she
is
in
a
fit
state
to
leave
the
house
was
wrong
i
know
she
said
standing
just
inside
the
door
of
the
parlour
gilbert
mentioned
that
he
had
seen
egremont
before
she
could
check
herself
lydia
exclaimed
he
looked
at
her
in
surprise
she
turned
very
pale
grail
was
also
gazing
at
her
was
at
the
end
of
newport
street
gilbert
replied
are
you
so
anxious
to
know
where
sure
i
do
know
i
worrying
so
about
that
child
i
spoke
without
thinking
at
all
half
an
hour
more
passed
then
as
all
sat
silently
together
they
heard
the
front
door
opening
lydia
started
up
move
gilbert
let
me
go
up
with
her
she
be
afraid
of
being
scolded
she
went
out
into
the
passage
the
little
lamp
hung
against
the
wall
as
usual
and
when
by
its
light
she
saw
thyrza
she
was
made
motionless
by
alarm
not
only
was
the
girl
face
scarcely
recognisable
her
clothing
was
stained
and
in
disorder
she
whispered
darling
what
has
happened
the
other
with
a
terrified
look
at
the
grails
door
ran
past
and
up
the
stairs
speaking
no
word
her
sister
followed
in
the
room
thyrza
did
not
sit
down
though
her
whole
body
trembled
she
took
off
her
hat
and
tried
to
undo
her
jacket
is
it
lydia
asked
coming
near
to
her
have
you
been
what
made
you
like
this
she
was
almost
as
pale
as
her
sister
and
fear
pressed
on
her
throat
knowing
what
she
did
she
imagined
some
dreadful
catastrophe
thyrza
seemed
unable
to
speak
and
her
eyes
were
so
wild
so
that
they
looked
like
madness
she
tried
to
smile
and
at
length
said
disconnectedly
nothing
lyddy
only
frightened
somebody
a
drunken
man
frightened
me
and
i
fell
down
nothing
else
lydia
could
make
no
reply
she
did
not
believe
the
story
silently
she
helped
to
remove
the
jacket
and
led
thyrza
to
a
chair
then
she
drew
the
dear
head
to
her
and
held
it
close
against
her
breast
are
so
cold
thyrza
where
have
you
been
tell
me
tell
lyddy
was
at
home
i
walked
a
little
way
gilbert
does
know
you
have
told
him
no
dear
it
all
right
come
nearer
to
the
fire
oh
how
cold
you
are
sit
on
my
lap
dearest
rest
your
head
against
me
why
have
you
been
crying
thyrza
there
was
no
answer
held
thus
in
her
sister
arms
thyrza
abandoned
herself
closed
her
eyes
let
every
limb
hang
as
it
would
tried
to
be
as
though
she
were
dead
lydia
thought
at
first
that
she
had
lost
consciousness
but
her
cry
brought
an
answer
they
sat
thus
for
some
minutes
then
thyrza
whispered
poorly
lyddy
let
me
go
to
bed
shall
dear
i
sit
by
you
you
let
me
stay
by
you
as
her
clothes
were
removed
she
shook
feverishly
wo
come
up
she
asked
several
times
grail
wo
come
go
and
tell
them
i
got
a
headache
and
that
it
be
all
right
in
the
morning
wo
come
dear
get
into
bed
and
i
go
and
tell
them
directly
she
could
have
wept
for
misery
but
she
must
be
strong
for
sake
whatever
hope
remained
depended
now
upon
her
own
and
prudence
when
thyrza
had
lain
down
lydia
succeeded
in
showing
almost
a
cheerful
face
just
go
down
and
say
you
poorly
you
wo
move
till
i
come
back
thyrza
shook
her
head
her
sister
was
only
away
for
a
minute
or
two
she
reentered
the
room
panting
with
the
speed
she
had
made
and
she
sat
down
at
the
bedside
there
was
no
word
for
a
long
time
thyrza
eyes
were
closed
her
lips
quivered
every
now
and
then
with
a
faint
sob
the
golden
braid
which
lydia
had
not
troubled
to
undo
lay
under
her
cheek
lydia
held
counsel
with
herself
something
had
happened
something
worse
she
thought
than
a
mere
fit
of
wretchedness
in
the
suffering
heart
there
was
no
explaining
the
disordered
state
in
which
the
girl
had
come
back
gilbert
said
that
he
had
met
egremont
at
the
end
of
newport
street
was
it
conceivable
that
thyrza
had
had
an
appointment
with
egremont
at
totty
house
no
that
was
not
to
be
credited
for
many
reasons
totty
by
luke
account
was
angry
with
thyrza
and
refused
to
hear
anything
of
what
was
going
on
yet
it
was
very
strange
that
he
should
be
going
to
see
bunce
just
at
the
same
time
that
thyrza
was
there
and
in
totty
absence
too
what
to
think
of
egremont
there
was
the
central
question
she
knew
him
scarcely
at
all
had
only
seen
him
on
that
one
occasion
when
she
opened
the
to
him
there
was
gilbert
constant
praise
of
him
but
lydia
knew
enough
of
the
world
to
understand
that
gilbert
might
very
easily
err
in
his
judgment
of
a
young
man
in
position
ackroyd
seemed
to
have
no
doubt
at
all
he
had
said
at
once
that
egremont
deserved
to
be
thrashed
clearly
he
believed
the
worst
of
egremont
attributed
to
him
a
deliberate
plot
if
he
was
right
then
what
might
not
have
befallen
she
had
said
to
herself
that
she
would
not
dishonour
her
sister
by
fearing
more
than
a
pardonable
weakness
now
there
was
a
black
dread
closing
in
upon
her
how
to
act
with
thyrza
must
she
reveal
all
that
ackroyd
told
her
and
so
compel
a
confession
not
that
if
it
could
possibly
be
avoided
it
would
drive
thyrza
to
despair
no
it
must
be
kept
from
her
that
prying
eyes
had
watched
her
going
and
coming
already
it
might
be
too
late
the
marriage
with
gilbert
might
be
impossible
if
only
because
thyrza
would
inevitably
betray
her
love
for
egremont
but
there
was
all
the
future
to
think
of
and
thyrza
must
not
be
driven
to
some
irreparable
folly
there
was
one
hypothesis
which
lydia
quite
left
aside
she
did
not
ask
herself
whether
egremont
might
not
truly
and
honestly
love
her
sister
it
was
natural
enough
that
she
should
not
think
of
it
every
tradition
weighed
in
favour
of
rascality
on
the
young
man
part
and
education
did
not
suffice
to
raise
her
above
the
common
point
of
view
in
such
a
matter
a
gentleman
did
not
fall
in
love
with
a
not
in
the
honest
sense
lydia
had
the
prejudices
of
her
class
and
her
judgment
went
full
against
egremont
from
the
outset
he
had
encouraged
secret
meetings
the
kind
of
thing
to
be
expected
he
must
have
known
perfectly
what
a
blow
he
was
preparing
for
gilbert
if
the
fact
of
these
meetings
should
be
discovered
what
did
he
care
for
that
his
selfishness
was
proof
against
every
scruple
no
doubt
she
could
not
argue
as
an
educated
person
might
have
done
zeal
in
his
various
undertakings
made
no
plea
for
his
character
in
her
mind
to
be
sure
a
more
subtle
reasoner
might
have
given
it
as
little
weight
but
that
would
have
been
the
result
of
conscious
wisdom
lydia
could
only
argue
from
her
predisposition
regarding
the
class
of
we
know
how
she
had
shrunk
from
meeting
egremont
guided
by
gilbert
and
thyrza
she
had
taught
herself
to
think
well
of
him
but
given
the
least
grounds
of
suspicion
was
urgent
to
condemn
only
one
way
recommended
itself
to
her
and
that
the
way
of
love
she
must
lead
thyrza
to
confide
in
her
must
get
at
the
secret
by
constraint
of
tenderness
she
might
seem
to
suspect
but
the
grounds
of
her
suspicion
must
be
hidden
having
resolved
this
she
leaned
nearer
and
spoke
gentle
words
such
as
might
soothe
thyrza
made
no
response
save
that
she
raised
her
lids
and
looked
wofully
one
what
is
it
you
keeping
from
me
lydia
pleaded
it
kind
thyrza
is
it
kind
to
me
it
is
enough
to
tell
me
poorly
there
more
than
that
do
you
think
i
can
look
at
you
and
not
see
that
you
have
a
secret
from
me
thyrza
had
closed
her
eyes
again
and
was
mute
how
can
you
be
afraid
of
your
old
lyddy
when
anything
you
glad
of
you
tell
me
ought
i
to
know
far
more
when
you
in
trouble
speak
to
me
dear
sister
i
put
my
head
near
yours
whisper
it
to
me
how
i
go
on
in
this
way
every
day
i
see
you
getting
worse
i
miserable
when
i
away
at
work
i
have
a
minute
peace
be
kind
to
me
and
say
what
has
happened
there
was
silence
you
think
there

in
me
but
love
for
you
my
dearest
my
thyrza
do
you
think
i
could
say
a
cruel
word

me
whatever
you
might
do
you
think
i
sha
love
you
only
the
better
the
more
unhappy
you
are
perhaps
i
half
know
what
it
is
perhaps
thyrza
started
and
gazed
with
the
same
wildness
as
when
she
first
came
in
know
what
do
you
know
tell
me
at
once
lyddy
do
really
know
anything
love
it
only
that
i
ca
help
thinking
i
noticed
things
thyrza
raised
herself
upon
one
arm
she
was
have
you
noticed
tell
me
at
once
you
no
right
to
say
things
of
that
kind

as

to
frighten
me
i
ca
bear
you
sitting
there
i
want
to
be
alone
if
you
must
stay
in
the
room

away
and
sit
by
the
fire
have
you
no
sewing
to
do
you
always
got
plenty
at
other
times
oh
you
make
me
feel
as
if
i
should
go
mad
lydia
withdrew
from
the
bedside
she
sat
down
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
thyrza
fell
back
exhausted
she
had
wrought
herself
almost
to
hysteria
and
though
she
could
not
shed
tears
the
dry
sobs
seemed
as
if
they
would
rend
her
bosom
minutes
passed
she
turned
and
looked
at
her
sister
lydia
was
bent
forward
propping
her
forehead
i
want
you
lydia
came
forward
she
had
been
crying
she
fell
on
her
knees
by
the
bed
what
did
you
mean
it
no
good
denying
it
you
meant
something
you
said
you
noticed
things
you
no
right
to
say
that
and
say
no
more
wo
tell
me
what
your
secret

saying
what
thought
got
no
secret
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
secret
have
you
have
you
seen
egremont
tonight
they
looked
at
each
other
thyrza
lips
were
just
parted
she
drew
herself
back
as
if
to
escape
scrutiny
the
arm
with
which
she
supported
herself
trembled
violently
do
you
ask
that
she
said
faintly
what
i
meant
thyrza
the
other
whispered
with
a
face
of
fear
i
seen
egremont
i
do
know
what
you
thinking
of
why
should
i
see
egremont
what
have
i
to
do
with
him
lydia
put
her
hand
forward
and
touched
her
sister
she
cried
passionately
me
tell
me
everything
i
ca
bear
it
if
you
have
ever
so
little
love
for
me
in
your
heart
tell
me
thyrza
could
no
longer
keep
her
raised
position
she
fell
back
then
with
one
hand
she
caught
the
railing
at
the
head
of
the
bed
and
held
it
convulsively
whilst
she
buried
her
face
in
the
pillow
lydia
bent
over
her
and
said
in
low
quick
tones
think
no
harm
of
you
perhaps
you
got
to
like
him
too
much
and
he
persuaded
you
to
go
to
meet
him
it
only
what
i
thought
to
myself

me
and
let
me
be
a
sister

you

it

could
help
it
only
let
us
both
know
and
talk
to
each
other
about
it
like
sisters
thyrza
grasp
of
the
iron
loosened
and
her
hand
fell
she
turned
her
face
to
the
light
again
how
do
you
know
this
thought
it
you
been
out
every
morning
you
spoke
of
him
in
a
way
any
one
said
anything
to
you
has
gilbert
no
gilbert
has
such
a
thought
it
all
myself
oh
what
has
he
been
saying
to
you
thyrza
a
change
was
coming
about
in
the
sufferer
what
had
at
the
first
suggestion
been
a
terror
now
grew
upon
her
as
an
assuagement
of
pain
she
clung
to
her
sister
hand
do
know
how
it
began
she
whispered
seems
so
sudden
but
i
think
it
been
coming
for
a
long
time
ever
since
i
saw
him
that
day
at
the
library
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
him
ever
since
there
been
a
day
i
have
thought
of
him
i
never
saw
any
one
else
that
made
me
think
like
that
day
and
night
lyddy
but
it
did
trouble
me
at
first
it
was
only
after
i
came
back
from
eastbourne
i
seemed
to
think
of
everything
in
a
different
way
after
that
i
dreamt
of
him
every
night
and
i
did
so
want
to
see
him
i
do
know
why
then
i
saw
him
at
last
on
monday
at
the
library
had
met
him
alone
before
then
never
since
that
first
time
why
did
you
go
there
on
monday
i
ca
ca
think
something
seemed
to
tell
me
to
go
there
i
found
there
was
some
books
come
and
he
was
putting
them
on
the
shelves
he
said
he
did
want
gilbert
to
know
just
for
fun
and
i
promised
not
to
say
anything
mean
last
monday
this
week
not
before
then
and
it
seems
oh
it
seems
a
month
ago
lyddy
she
lay
back
pressing
lydia
hand
against
her
heart
did
he
ask
you
to
go
again
dear
he
did
it
was
all
myself
lyddy
i
could
keep
away
i
could
will
you
believe
i
telling
the
truth
i
tried
i
did
try
so
hard
i
knew
i
ought
to
go
because
i
wanted
to
so
much
i
knew
it
was
wrong
i
do
think
i
should
have
gone
if
grail
had
forced
me
to
go
out
for
a
walk
because
she
said
it
would
take
my
headache
away
i
was
holding
myself
back
all
the
morning
and
when
i
got
out
i
could
help
it
i
was
drawn
there
and
then
i
asked
him
if
i
might
come
again
he
said
i
might
but
i
could
see
he
thought
it
was
wrong
of
me
and
lyddy
he
never
came
i
stayed
there
waiting
oh

i
suffered

you
but

she
asked
nervously

only
think
it
the
way
you
came
in
thyrza
suddenly
bent
forward
listening
any
one

us
she
whispered
and
see
any
one
outside
no
one
dear
and
look
i
afraid
lydia
went
and
opened
the
door
she
closed
it
again
and
came
back
shaking
her
head
did
think
i
should
see
him
thyrza
continued
was
waiting
in
totty
room
and
he
came
to
see
bunce
i
heard
his
voice
when
he
went
away
i
followed
him
i
could
help
myself
i
would
have
given
my
life
for
a
word
from
him
i
wanted
to
know
why
he
had
come
this
morning
i
followed
him
and
walked
with
him
over
the
bridge
then
he
told
me
he
was
going
away
somewhere
out
of
england
and
i
see
him
again
till
after
after
i
was
married
she
choked
lydia
soothed
her
again
and
she
continued
with
growing
agitation
he
said
he
went
away
very
quickly
after
just
saying
he
hoped
i
should
be
happy
happy
how
can
i
be
happy
and
when
he
was
gone
i
went
somewhere
and
fell
down
and
cried
somewhere
where
nobody
could
see
me
he
gone
lyddy
how
am
i
to
live
without
him
they
held
each
other
thyrza
sobbed
out
her
anguish
until
strength
failed
then
lay
in
her
sister
arms
pale
as
a
corpse
when
there
had
been
utter
silence
for
a
while
lydia
asked
he
has
never
said
anything
to
you
that
that
he
ought
to
have
said
what
did
you
think
you
thought
he
he
loved
did
know
dearest
if
he
did
he
asked
me
not
to
call
him
and
to
be
his
friend
never
more
than
that
you
thought
he
loved
me
how
could
he
love
a
girl
like
me
lyddy
lydia
had
followed
the
unfolding
of
the
tale
with
growing
surprise
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
thyrza
truthfulness
yet
there
must
be
more
on
egremont
part
than
appeared
why
did
he
exact
secrecy
about
those
meetings
in
the
library
there
was
little
doubt
that
thyrza
had
betrayed
herself
to
him
true
he
had
refrained
from
keeping
the
appointment
for
this
morning
and
it
seemed
he
was
going
away
till
after
the
marriage
but
all
this
was
too
late
still
he
was
innocent
of
the
guilt
she
had
suspected
thyrza
had
not
come
to
the
dreaded
harm
though
heartbroken
she
was
saved
lydia
felt
almost
joyous
for
an
instant
bower
gossip
might
yet
be
deprived
of
its
sting
for
egremont
would
be
gone
and
monday
was
so
near
it
was
the
reaction
from
her
terror
she
could
think
of
nothing
for
the
moment
but
that
thyrza
must
be
preserved
from
future
risk
by
marriage
thyrza
was
lying
exhausted
lydia
deep
in
thought
was
surprised
to
see
a
faint
smile
on
the
beautiful
pale
face
thought
he
loved
me
was
whispered
if
he
did
if
he
did
lydia
was
still
kneeling
new
fears
were
making
themselves
heard
was
it
possible
for
thyrza
to
marry
gilbert
under
such
circumstances
and
within
five
days
what
if
gilbert
heard
bower
story
nay
in
any
case
what
of
the
future
egremont
would
be
constantly
at
the
library
do
you
never
think
of
gilbert
thyrza
raised
herself
again
the
look
of
wild
dread
in
her
eyes
i
ca
marry
him
you
know
now
that
i
ca
do
you
it
would
be
wrong
i
shall
love
as
long
as
ever
i
live
love
him
and
think
of
him
every
minute
i
ca
marry
gilbert
there
was
silence
lydia
looked
up
with
tearful
appealing
eyes
my
dearest
think
think
what
that
means
how
can
you
break
your
word
to
him
now
when
the
day
almost
here
think
what
it
mean
to
him
you
have
to
tell
him
the
reason
and
then
tell
him
everything
i
bear
it
can
i
help
it
lyddy
am
i
happy
you
have
thought
thyrza
it
means
that
gilbert
will
have
to
go
on
with
his
work
at
the
factory
his
mother
will
go
and
live
with
him
at
the
library
her
voice
sank
she
began
to
understand
you
suppose
he
can
take
that
place
from
egremont
after
he
knows
this
thyrza
thyrza
was
mute
for
a
little
then
she
said
under
her
breath
need
know
the
reason
he
must
think
it
something
else
impossible
what
a
cruel
thing
it
be
to
him
you
know
how
he
looked
forward
and
then
he
loves
you
he
loves
you
more
than
you
think
it
will
be
dreadful
thyrza
i
do
think
you
make
poor
gilbert
suffer
in
that
way
you
could
do
that
dear
you
know
what
love
means
have
some
pity
for
him
cant
he
sha
know
the
reason
he
shall
go
to
the
library
just
the
same
we
say
it
only
put
off
i
ca
marry
him
on
monday
sooner
kill
myself
there
was
a
ring
of
terrible
earnestness
in
the
words
lydia
was
afraid
to
plead
any
more
at
present
she
affected
to
admit
that
there
was
no
help
yes
the
marriage
should
be
postponed
perhaps
that
would
be
a
way
the
hour
was
late
after
her
sister
acquiescence
thyrza
had
fallen
into
brooding
she
moved
constantly
there
was
fire
in
her
cheeks
only
a
few
words
were
exchanged
whilst
lydia
undressed
and
lay
down
by
her
sister
sleep
was
impossible
to
either
of
them
yet
thyrza
had
not
closed
her
eyes
the
night
before
she
was
very
feverish
could
not
lie
in
one
position
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
when
neither
had
spoken
for
nearly
an
hour
she
said
of
a
sudden
i
want
you
to
promise
me
that
you
never
tell
gilbert
nor
grail
one
word
of
this
i
want
you
to
promise
promise
you
dear
how
could
i
think
of
doing
so
without
your
leave
there
was
a
pause
then
thyrza
resumed
think
you
do
as
you
say
kiss
me
and
promise
again
will
keep
your
secret
dearest
i
promise
you
the
other
sighed
deeply
and
after
that
lay
still
chapter
xxiv
the
end
of
the
dream
gilbert
did
not
go
to
work
next
morning
though
lydia
had
disguised
her
sister
strange
condition
as
well
as
she
could
he
knew
that
something
was
being
kept
from
him
and
his
mind
ever
ready
to
doubt
the
reality
of
the
happiness
that
had
been
granted
him
was
at
length
so
beset
with
fears
that
he
could
no
longer
pay
attention
to
the
day
business
he
rose
at
the
usual
time
but
with
a
word
at
his
mother
door
made
known
his
intention
not
to
go
out
till
after
breakfast
having
lit
a
fire
in
the
parlour
he
sat
down
and
tried
to
read
he
had
purposed
working
till
saturday
and
night
thursday
and
friday
thyrza
and
he
were
to
go
and
purchase
such
articles
of
furniture
and
the
like
as
would
be
needed
for
the
new
house
the
list
was
long
since
carefully
made
out
and
the
places
of
purchase
decided
upon
and
these
would
be
taken
in
by
butterfield
on
saturday
afternoon
the
contents
of
gilbert
own
room
were
to
be
removed
on
that
and
the
following
night
he
would
sleep
under
the
new
roof
and
by
monday
morning
would
have
things
in
sufficient
order
to
allow
of
grail
and
lydia
coming
for
these
two
were
to
keep
each
other
company
whilst
he
and
his
wife
were
away
by
this
scheme
he
might
work
on
to
the
end
of
the
week
and
suffer
no
loss
of
wages
but
gilbert
was
not
a
machine
unhappily
for
himself
even
had
nothing
external
occurred
to
trouble
the
order
he
had
planned
his
own
mood
would
probably
have
rendered
steady
work
impossible
now
that
he
could
positively
count
on
his
fingers
the
days
before
his
marriage
day
before
the
day
which
would
make
him
a
free
man
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
two
such
blessings
could
descend
upon
a
mortal
at
once
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
very
hours
as
they
went
by
looked
on
him
with
faces
of
mysterious
menace
foretelling
a
dread
successor
since
monday
he
had
with
difficulty
accomplished
his
tasks
each
time
he
hastened
home
it
was
with
unreasoning
fear
lest
something
bad
come
to
pass
in
his
absence
and
now
it
was
no
longer
only
apprehension
thyrza
was
changing
under
his
eyes
she
was
physically
ill
and
he
knew
that
some
agitation
possessed
her
mind
she
shrank
from
him
the
glimmer
of
early
morning
at
the
parlour
window
was
cold
and
threatening
a
faint
ray
of
sunlight
showed
itself
only
to
fade
upon
a
low
sky
the
sounds
of
labour
recommencing
were
as
wearisome
to
him
as
they
always
are
to
one
who
has
watched
through
an
unending
night
the
house
itself
seemed
unnaturally
silent
grail
came
in
at
length
and
looked
at
him
anxiously
her
own
eyes
lacked
the
refreshment
of
sleep
did
feel
able
to
go
mother
he
said
want
to
hear
how
thyrza
is
as
soon
as
possible
perhaps
you
can
go
up
presently
she
murmured
an
assent
and
began
to
lay
the
table
in
a
few
minutes
she
ascended
very
quietly
and
listened
at
the
door
her
report
was
that
she
could
hear
no
sound
they
must
both
be
sleeping
an
hour
went
by
mother
and
son
made
no
pretence
of
conversing
gilbert
kept
an
open
book
before
him
rain
had
begun
to
fall
and
the
sky
darkened
as
the
minutes
ticked
themselves
away
by
the
clock
on
the
then
there
was
a
sound
on
the
stairs
lydia
came
into
the
room
and
with
her
thyrza
lydia
smiled
and
tried
to
draw
attention
from
her
sister
by
lamenting
their
lateness
at
the
meal
were
afraid
you
have
gone
away
again
she
said
to
gilbert
do
think
i
shall
go
to
work
this
morning
he
replied
quietly
she
became
silent
thyrza
had
drawn
a
chair
to
the
table
one
saw
that
she
had
risen
with
difficulty
that
she
with
difficulty
sat
upright
gilbert
without
speaking
went
and
sat
by
her
lydia
was
dreading
questions
but
she
did
injustice
to
the
delicacy
of
his
mind
grail
just
said
very
pale
still
dear
and
nothing
more
the
meal
was
made
as
short
as
possible
then
lydia
helped
grail
to
take
the
things
to
the
kitchen
thyrza
before
coming
down
had
asked
to
be
left
alone
with
gilbert
for
a
few
minutes
grail
was
at
the
window
watching
the
rain
he
heard
thyrza
approaching
him
and
turned
she
said
without
raising
her
eyes
behaving
very
unkindly
to
you
will
you
forgive
me
are
you
behaving
unkindly
thyrza
he
asked
with
gently
expressed
surprise
been
keeping
away
from
you
i
could
help
it
i
do
feel
myself
are
ill
thyrza
am
i
to
forgive
you
for
that
i
am
gilbert
is
it
too
late
to
ask
you
will
you
put
it
off
for
a
week
one
week
he
let
a
minute
pass
before
replying
seeing
that
she
trembled
as
she
stood
he
led
her
to
a
chair
the
chair
in
which
she
always
sat
he
said
at
length
will
do
whatever
you
wish
shall
be
better
by
then
i
think
but
i
go
with
you
to
buy
the
things
just
the
same
can
leave
that
for
a
few
days
he
said
absently
would
make
any
difference
to
you
at
the
library
i
am
sure
i
will
write
and
tell
egremont
he
will
be
very
sorry
to
hear
of
your
illness
she
stood
up
and
looked
at
the
clock
made
you
late
for
your
work
sha
go
wo
go
she
asked
ca
thyrza
i
too
uneasy
about
you
be
that
gilbert
i
promise
you
to
try
and
get
better
another
silence
then
he
asked
you
stay
here
this
morning
she
just
raised
her
face
fear
and
entreaty
were
on
the
features
only
came
down
for
breakfast
to
ask
you
that
and
and
to
tell
you
i
was
so
sorry
be
sure
he
replied
at
once
are
not
well
enough
to
be
up
lyddy
will
stay
with
you
she
is
going
to
stay
i
come
and
see
you
again
if
i
feel
able
she
offered
her
hand
he
took
it
held
it
a
little
then
said
is
there
anything
on
your
mind
anything
you
do
wish
to
tell
me
just
now
but
in
a
day
or
two
perhaps
gilbert
no
if
you
forgive
me
for
behaving
unkindly
how
can
there
be
any
forgiving
so
long
as
i
love
you
there
must
be
blame
before
there
is
need
of
forgiveness
and
i
love
you
too
well
to
think
a
reproachful
thought
she
bent
her
head
and
sobbed
is
it
any
happiness
to
you
to
know
that
i
love
you
it
is
you
are
very
good
i
know
i
am
making
you
suffer
i
shall
see
the
old
face
again
before
long
i
shall
be
myself
again
soon
she
left
him
and
went
upstairs
a
minute
or
two
after
lydia
knocked
at
the
door
has
gone
up
she
asked
come
here
lydia
he
spoke
with
abruptness
lydia
drew
near
know
that
she
has
asked
me
to
put
off
our
marriage
for
a
week
did
know
that
she
was
going
to
ask
you
now
i
thought
perhaps
she
wished
it
ca
ask
you
to
betray
your
sister
secrets
but
lyddy
you
keep
anything
from
me
that
i
to
know
he
paused
then
went
on
again
with
a
shaking
voice
are
some
things
that
i
to
know
if
you
know
that
lyddy
you
owe
love
to
your
sister
first
but
you
owe
something
to
me
as
well
there
are
some
things
you
would
have
no
right
to
keep
from
me
you
might
be
doing
both
her
and
me
the
greatest
wrong
lydia
could
not
face
him
she
tried
to
speak
but
uttered
only
a
meaningless
word
is
ill
he
pursued
ca
ask
her
as
i
feel
i
ought
to
what
has
made
her
tell
me
this
as
you
are
a
good
and
a
truthful
girl
if
i
marry
thyrza
shall
i
be
taking
advantage
of
her
weakness
does
she
wish
me
to
free
her
does
indeed
gilbert
she
does
you
are
her
very
best
friend
all
her
life
depends
upon
you
you
wo
break
it
off
perhaps
she
will
even
be
well
enough
by
the
end
of
the
week
remember
how
young
she
is
and
how
often
she
has
strange
fancies
tell
me
solemnly
that
thyrza
still
wishes
to
be
my
wife
does
she
wishes
to
be
your
wife
gilbert
to
lydia
her
sister
fate
hung
in
the
balance
what
she
uttered
was
verbally
true
before
rising
thyrza
had
said
will
marry
him
in
the
possible
breaking
of
this
bond
lydia
saw
such
a
terrible
danger
that
her
instincts
of
absolute
sincerity
for
once
were
overridden
if
she
spoke
falsely
it
was
to
save
her
sister
thyrza
once
married
the
face
of
life
would
be
altered
for
her
this
sudden
passionate
love
would
fall
like
a
brief
flame
lydia
had
decided
upon
a
bold
step
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
she
would
go
and
see
egremont
see
him
herself
and
if
he
had
any
heart
or
any
honour
prevail
with
him
that
thyrza
might
be
spared
temptation
but
the
marriage
must
first
be
over
and
must
be
brought
about
at
all
costs
in
her
life
she
had
never
spoken
an
untruth
for
her
own
advantage
now
as
she
spoke
the
sense
that
her
course
was
chosen
gave
her
courage
she
looked
gilbert
at
length
boldly
in
the
face
his
confidence
in
her
was
so
great
that
his
own
desires
aiding
he
believed
her
to
the
full
thyrza
suffering
he
said
to
himself
had
not
the
grave
meaning
he
had
feared
it
was
something
that
must
be
sacred
from
his
search
so
much
power
was
there
in
lydia
word
uttered
for
her
saving
all
day
long
it
rained
gilbert
did
not
go
from
the
house
he
wrestled
with
hope
which
was
still
only
to
be
held
by
persistent
effort
sunshine
would
have
aided
him
but
all
day
he
looked
upon
a
gloomy
wet
street
at
he
had
all
but
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
work
the
thought
however
was
too
hateful
to
him
and
he
felt
it
would
be
hard
to
meet
men
faces
perhaps
there
would
be
comfort
by
the
morrow
thyrza
did
in
fact
come
down
for
tea
she
spoke
only
a
few
words
but
she
seemed
stronger
than
in
the
morning
lydia
had
a
brighter
face
too
they
went
up
again
together
after
the
meal
another
night
passed
lydia
slept
she
believed
that
the
worst
was
over
and
that
there
might
after
all
be
no
postponement
of
the
marriage
for
thyrza
had
become
very
quiet
she
seemed
worn
out
with
struggle
and
resigned
her
sleep
she
said
had
been
good
yet
her
eyelids
were
swollen
no
doubt
she
had
cried
in
the
night
lydia
had
no
intention
of
leaving
home
gilbert
had
gone
to
work
reassured
by
her
report
the
last
thing
on
the
previous
evening
there
was
no
more
speech
between
the
sisters
on
the
subject
of
their
thoughts
through
the
morning
thyrza
lay
so
still
that
lydia
thinking
her
asleep
now
and
then
stepped
lightly
and
bent
over
her
each
time
however
she
found
the
sad
eyes
gazing
fixedly
upwards
thyrza
just
turned
them
to
her
but
without
change
of
expression
look
at
me
like
that
dear
lydia
said
once
as
if
you
did
know
me
the
reply
was
a
brief
smile
thyrza
got
up
in
the
afternoon
about
five
when
lydia
was
making
tea
jarmey
came
with
a
message
she
said
boddy
had
sent
word
that
he
wished
to
see
lydia
particularly
he
begged
she
would
come
during
the
evening
brought
the
message
lydia
asked
going
outside
the
door
to
speak
with
the
landlady
little
boy
was
the
answer
never
see
him
before
as
i
know
lydia
was
disturbed
it
might
only
mean
that
the
old
man
was
anxious
at
not
having
seen
her
for
five
or
six
days
or
that
he
was
ill
but
the
fact
of
his
living
in
the
bowers
house
suggested
another
explanation
an
answer
was
required
she
sent
back
word
that
she
would
come
sha
be
more
than
half
an
hour
away
at
the
very
longest
she
said
when
she
reluctantly
prepared
to
go
out
after
tea
you
like
to
go
downstairs
just
for
that
time
dear
lyddy
i
stay
thyrza
had
left
her
chair
and
stood
with
her
hand
resting
on
the
she
did
not
turn
her
head
funny
you
look
with
your
hair
like
that
thyrza
had
declined
to
have
her
hair
braided
and
had
coiled
it
herself
in
a
new
way
she
made
no
reply
pet
lydia
said
coming
near
thyrza
did
not
move
she
was
looking
downwards
at
the
fire
lydia
touched
her
she
started
and
with
a
steady
gaze
said
lyddy
do
wish
i
had
to
go
but
i
shall
be
very
quick
they
kissed
each
other
and
lydia
hastened
on
her
errand
her
absence
did
not
last
much
longer
than
the
time
she
had
set
boddy
had
heard
from
bower
all
the
story
about
egremont
he
gave
no
faith
to
it
but
wished
to
warn
lydia
that
such
gossip
was
afloat
and
to
receive
from
her
an
authoritative
denial
she
declared
it
to
be
false
from
beginning
to
end
without
a
moment
hesitation
she
did
this
having
determined
that
there
was
no
middle
course
she
denied
that
thyrza
had
been
to
the
library
whoever
originated
the
story
had
done
so
in
malice
she
enjoined
upon
him
to
contradict
it
without
reserve
she
felt
as
if
she
were
being
hunted
by
merciless
beasts
to
escape
them
any
means
were
justifiable
of
the
bowers
she
thought
with
bitter
hatred
no
wrong
to
herself
could
have
excited
all
her
fiercest
emotions
as
did
this
attack
upon
her
sister
running
homewards
she
felt
the
will
and
the
strength
to
take
the
life
of
her
enemy
she
had
entered
the
bowers
house
and
left
it
by
the
private
door
it
was
well
that
she
had
met
no
one
she
remembered
that
thyrza
must
not
discover
her
excitement
and
went
up
the
stairs
slowly
regaining
breath
trying
to
smooth
her
face
a
fable
to
account
for
boddy
summons
was
ready
on
her
tongue
she
entered
and
found
an
empty
room
so
thyrza
had
gone
down
to
grail
after
all
that
was
good
the
poor
girl
was
making
a
brave
struggle
and
would
conquer
herself
yet
if
only
bower
gossip
could
be
kept
from
gilbert
but
there
was
still
a
long
time
till
monday
still
two
whole
days
and
bower
determined
as
he
evidently
was
to
work
mischief
would
not
neglect
the
supreme
opportunity
it
would
have
been
better
if
gilbert
had
not
returned
to
work
she
took
off
her
things
what
was
that
lying
on
the
table
an
envelope
a
dirty
one
which
had
been
in
the
drawer
for
a
long
time
on
it
was
written
it
was
thyrza
writing
lydia
opened
it
inside
was
a
rough
piece
of
white
paper
torn
off
a
sheet
in
which
something
had
been
wrapped
it
was
written
upon
and
the
writing
said
this
have
gone
away
i
ca
marry
gilbert
and
i
ca
tell
him
the
truth
remember
your
promise
some
day
i
shall
come
back
to
you
when
everything
is
different
remember
your
promise
so
that
gilbert
can
go
to
the
library
just
the
same
no
harm
will
come
to
me
my
dear
dear
sister
if
you
love
me
you
will
say
you
know
nothing
so
that
it
will
be
all
right
for
gilbert
lyddy
darling
crushing
the
paper
in
her
hand
lydia
just
as
she
was
ran
out
into
the
street
it
was
not
yet
dark
instinctively
after
one
glance
towards
kennington
road
she
took
the
opposite
way
and
made
for
newport
street
thyrza
would
communicate
with
totty
nancarrow
if
with
any
one
at
all
she
would
not
go
there
at
once
but
totty
must
be
won
over
to
aid
in
discovering
the
child
and
bringing
her
back
it
rained
not
heavily
but
enough
to
dew
lydia
hair
in
a
few
minutes
little
she
thought
of
that
thyrza
wandering
alone
straying
off
into
some
far
part
of
london
thyrza
ill
as
she
was
with
at
most
a
few
pence
to
procure
lodging
for
this
one
night
alone
among
what
dangers
the
thought
was
fire
in
her
brain
she
was
in
paradise
street
and
someone
stood
in
her
way
speaking
where
ever
are
you
going
like
that
it
was
mary
bower
lydia
glared
at
her
dare
you
speak
to
me
i
hate
you
and
with
a
wild
gesture
almost
a
blow
at
the
girl
she
rushed
on
totty
had
just
come
in
from
work
lydia
scarcely
waited
for
a
reply
to
her
knock
before
she
burst
into
the
room
will
you
help
me
thyrza
has
left
me
gone
away
i
was
out
for
half
an
hour
she
left
a
note
for
me
to
say
help
me
to
find
her
do
you
know
anything
can
you
think
where
she
go
totty
was
on
her
knees
lighting
a
fire
in
her
amazement
she
made
no
effort
to
rise
a
lighted
piece
of
paper
was
in
her
hand
forgetting
it
she
let
the
flame
creep
on
till
it
burnt
her
fingers
then
she
stood
up
does
she
say
in
the
note
she
asked
with
deliberation
lydia
opened
her
hand
and
spread
out
the
crumpled
paper
she
was
going
to
read
aloud
but
checked
herself
and
looked
at
the
other
piteously
know
all
about
it
do
you
thyrza
told
you
suppose
i
know
pretty
well
totty
replied
in
the
same
deliberate
and
distant
way
she
said
anything
to
you
about
going
away
do
know
as
she
has
look
what
she
written
totty
hesitated
then
said
you
i
rather
not
it
not
my
business
if
i
was
you
speak
to
ackroyd
i
know
nothing
about
thyrza
mr
ackroyd
exclaimed
lydia
i
sure
she
wo
see
him
it
you
hear
from
her
if
anybody
does
ca
you
think
of
any
place
she
be
likely
to
go
has
she
never
said
anything
in
talking
you
would
keep
it
back
just
because
you
do
like
me
it
my
sister
she
all
i
have
you
know
she
ca
look
out
for
herself
like
you
and
me
could
and
she
been
ill
since
monday
wo
you
help
me
if
you
can
just
because
i
in
trouble
help
you
if
i
could
replied
the
other
not
unmoved
by
the
appeal
but
still
distant
quite
sure
thyrza
wo
let
me
know
where
she
is
if
you
take
my
advice
you
see
mr
ackroyd
in
her
agitation
lydia
could
not
reflect
upon
the
complicated
details
of
the
case
she
never
doubted
that
totty
knew
the
truth
in
this
we
know
luke
had
unintentionally
deceived
her
perhaps
the
advice
to
consult
ackroyd
was
good
perhaps
he
had
learned
something
more
since
wednesday
night
something
that
totty
also
knew
but
did
not
care
to
communicate
herself
try
and
find
him
lydia
said
if
you
do
hear
any
thing
you
would
keep
it
from
me
hear
just
as
soon
as
i
do
was
the
reply
lydia
turned
away
feeling
that
the
girl
coldness
was
a
cruelty
wondering
at
it
she
herself
could
not
have
behaved
so
to
one
in
dire
need
she
was
going
away
but
totty
stopped
her
ca
go
back
like
that
in
the
rain
take
my
umbrella
do
i
care
for
the
rain
lydia
cried
must
find
thyrza
i
thought
you
pretended
to
be
her
friend
she
hastened
into
the
street
not
many
yards
from
the
door
she
met
the
man
she
desired
to
see
ackroyd
was
coming
to
ask
for
totty
for
the
first
time
since
tuesday
night
lydia
drew
him
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
and
hurriedly
told
him
showing
him
the
scrap
of
paper
been
to
totty
she
added
did
seem
to
wish
to
help
me
she
spoke
as
if
she
did
care
and
said
i
better
ask
you
do
you
know
anything
more
he
was
mute
at
first
his
mind
naturally
turned
to
one
thought
then
he
said
speaking
slowly
know
nothing
more
except
that
lots
of
people
have
heard
story
does
grail
know
unless
he
has
heard
since
this
morning
have
seen
much
of
him
but
i
noticed
he
looked
very
queer
because
thyrza
asked
him
to
put
off
the
wedding
for
a
week
i
never
thought
she
leave
me
we
talked
about
everything
that
night
after
i
left
you
i
pretended
i
found
it
out
myself
i
durst
let
her
know
that
other
people
had
noticed
anything
she
had
a
dreadful
night
but
she
seemed
better
since
did
she
tell
you
everything
she
said
he
never
spoken
a
word
to
her
that
he
should
i
sure
it
was
the
truth
thyrza
would
have
deceived
me
like
that
he
gone
away
somewhere
out
of
london
luke
stopped
her
he
looked
closely
at
her
through
the
dusk
and
said
in
a
low
voice
gone
away
did
tell
you
he
was
going
away
he
said
to
her
and
hoped
she
would
be
happy
lydia
if
he
gone
away
and
now
gone
lydia
understood
him
do
think
that
she
said
her
eyes
full
of
fear
no
sure
that
is
true
he
never
said
a
word
to
her
he
had
given
her
to
think
he
cared
for
her
she
cried
because
he
did
if
she
so
mad
with
love
of
him
luke
said
dropping
his
eyes
knows
what
she
might
do
you
never
have
thought
she
could
leave
you
like
this
the
rain
was
falling
more
heavily
as
lydia
stood
unable
to
utter
any
argument
against
him
ackroyd
saw
that
her
hair
was
quite
wet
must
stand
out
here
he
said
round
into
paradise
street
with
me
and
i
get
you
something
of
my
sister
to
go
home
in
poor
girl
you
came
out
like
this
as
soon
as
you
found
she
was
gone
come
quick
or
you
get
your
death
she
accompanied
him
without
speaking
her
mind
was
working
on
the
suggestion
he
had
uttered
against
her
will
he
compelled
her
to
step
into
the
house
whilst
he
procured
a
hat
and
a
garment
for
her
he
took
care
that
no
one
saw
her
and
when
she
was
clad
he
went
out
with
her
carrying
an
umbrella
for
her
protection
come
with
me
she
said
you
must
let
me

was
going
to
try
and

to
he
asked
after
examining
her
for
an
instant
she
could
not
speak
and
could
not
stir
from
the
place
her
hope
had
been
to
have
time
before
she
saw
him
where
has
thyrza
gone
she
stepped
into
the
room
the
piece
of
paper
was

within
her
hand

held
it
closer

back
grail
was
in
the
background
she
was
supporting
herself
by
a
chair
her
face
gave
proof
of
some
agitation
just
experienced
gilbert
was
very
pale
but
when
lydia
ended
he
seemed
to
master
himself
and
spoke
with
an
unnatural
calm
you
heard
anything
he
asked
a
calumny
the
bowers
have
been
spreading
about
your
sister
and
mr
egremont

than
useless
without
speaking
she
held
to
him
the
scrap
of
paper
he
having
read
turned
to
his
mother
you
let
us
be
alone
mother
the
poor
old
woman
went
with
bowed
head
from
the
room
gilbert
voice
dropped
to
a
lower
note
as
you
have
shown
me
this
you
must
have
decided
that
you
can
not
keep
the
promise
which
is
spoken
of
here
ca
keep
it
gilbert
because
you
might
think
worse
of
thyrza
if
i
do
worse
then
you
suppose
i
believe
what
is
said
about
her
about
thyrza
ca
think
you
believe
what
bower
people
to
but
you
ca
know
how
little
she
been
to
blame
he
was
silent
then
said
came
home
a
few
minutes
ago
thinking
that
what
bunce
has
just
told
was
a
mere
lie
set
afloat
by
someone
who
wished
us
harm
i
thought
thyrza
knew
of
the
lie
and
that
it
had
made
her
ill
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
speak
to
me
of
it
but
i
see
there
something
more
she
stood
before
him
like
one
guilty
his
calmness
was
terrible
to
her
she
seemed
to
feel
in
herself
all
the
anguish
which
he
was
repressing
he
continued
told
me
yesterday
morning
that
thyrza
still
wished
to
marry
me
this
note
shows
me
why
you
said
that
and
in
what
sense
you
meant
it
i
do
blame
you
lydia
you
were
loyal
to
your
sister
but
i
must
ask
you
something
else
now
and
your
answer
must
be
the
simple
truth
does
thyrza
love
mr
egremont
gilbert
she
said
it
with
failing
voice
and
as
soon
as
she
had
spoken
burst
into
tears
i
have
broken
the
promise
i
made
to
my
dear
one
the
last
thing
she
asked
and
perhaps
i
shall
never
see
her
again
what
could
i
do
gilbert
if
i
kept
it
back
you
have
thought
there
was
something
worse
she
seems
to
have
behaved
cruel
to
you
but
you
do
know
what
she
gone
through
she
so
ill
she
go
somewhere
and
die
and
i
shall
never
hear
her
speak
to
me
again
i
been
unkind
to
her
so
often
she
does
know
how
i
love
her
gilbert
help
me
to
find
her
i
ca
live
without
my
sister
do
be
angry
with
her
gilbert
suffered
dreadful
if
you
only
knew
she
tried
so
hard
her
last
thought
was
about
you
and
how
she
could
spare
you
forgive
her
and
bring
her
back
to
me
what
shall
we
do
to
find
her
oh
i
lose
her
my
little
sister
my
dear
one
one
would
have
thought
gilbert
had
no
grief
of
his
own
so
anxiously
did
he
try
to
comfort
her
he
said
when
she
could
listen
to
him
are
sister
and
will
always
be
if
i
could
think
unkindly
of
thyrza
now
i
should
show
that
i
was
never
worthy
of
her
do
hurt
me
by
saying
such
things
we
will
find
her
have
no
fear
we
will
find
her
you
do
as
she
wished
you
still
go
to
the
library
ca
think
of
myself
yet
lyddy
you
must
have
her
back
again
and
there
be
time
enough
to
think
of
trifles
let
me
tell
you
all
i
know
gilbert
he
does
love
her
you
must
think
that
there
never
been
a
word
between
them
she
went
to
help
him
with
the
books
and
so
it
came
on
her
true
then
he
said
gravely
they
met
there
did
encourage
her
she
told
me
again
and
again
he
did
she
went
on
wednesday
morning
and
he
never
came
that
was
on
purpose
sure
why
was
i
told
about
the
books
wanted
to
surprise
you
and
now
he
gone
away
gilbert
he
told
her
he
would
be
back
till
after
her
marriage
gone
away
she
raised
her
face
and
continued
eagerly
see
why
he
went
do
you
i
had
hard
thoughts
of
him
at
first
but
now
i
know
i
was
wrong
you
think
so
much
of
him
you
know
he
would
be
so
cowardly
and
wicked
thyrza
told
me
the
solemn
truth
i
would
die
rather
than
doubt
her
word
you
must
believe
her
gilbert
it
all
so
hard
she
could
help
it
and
you
must
think
harm
of
him
he
said
under
his
breath
must
try
not
to
she
sat
down
overcome
yielding
herself
to
voiceless
misery
it
was
a
long
time
before
gilbert
spoke
you
know
where
he
is
gone
to
lyddy
i
do
again
silence
then
he
moved
and
looked
at
the
clock
you
sit
with
my
mother
this
is
a
great
blow
to
her
as
well
and
it
is
hard
to
bear
at
her
age
i
will
go
out
and
see
what
i
can
do
do
fear
we
find
her
you
shall
soon
have
her
back
do
you
feel
able
to
sit
with
mother
i
will
gilbert
you
it
will
be
kindness
i
do
think
i
shall
be
very
late
in
passing
her
he
just
touched
her
hand
in
the
meanwhile
ackroyd
had
returned
to
newport
street
he
sent
up
word
by
the
landlady
that
he
wished
to
see
totty
the
latter
sent
a
reply
to
him
that
perhaps
she
would
be
coming
out
in
about
an
hour
but
could
not
be
certain
he
waited
standing
in
the
rain
over
against
the
house
perhaps
twenty
minutes
passed
then
he
saw
the
girl
come
forth
ca
talk
here
luke
said
joining
her
you
come
under
the
archway
yonder
do
see
that
we
got
so
much
to
talk
about
totty
answered
indifferently
i
several
things
to
ask
you
right
but
i
ca
wait
out
in
the
cold
for
long
they
went
in
the
direction
away
from
paradise
street
and
found
shelter
under
a
black
vault
of
the
railway
a
train
roared
above
their
heads
as
they
entered
just
seen
lydia
trent
he
began
you
expect
that
anything
of
this
kind
would
happen
told
you
already
that
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
thyrza
and
her
goings
on
i
told
lydia
she
better
go
to
you
if
she
wanted
to
find
her
sister
i
hope
you
told
her
all
you
know
do
you
mean
by
that
how
should
i
be
able
to
help
her
to
find
thyrza
do
bother
me
totty
exclaimed
with
impatience
sick
of
it
if
you
brought
me
out
to
talk
in
this
way
you
might
as
well
have
let
it
alone
are
you
driving
at
totty
i
tell
you
i
do
understand
you
speak
plainly
if
you
please
you
think
that
i
know
where
thyrza
is
suppose
you
as
likely
to
as
anybody
confound
it
why
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
turned
away
he
pressed
his
question
with
growing
impatience
what
did
you
come
telling
me
the
other
night
cried
totty
at
length
was
like
your
impudence
did
i
tell
you
i
did
tell
you
anything
i
asked
if
you
knew
of
something
and
you
said
you
did
i
do
see
how
i
was
impudent
after
hearing
bower
tale
it
was
likely
i
should
come
and
speak
to
you
about
it
tale
what
tale
do
know
that
bower
found
it
all
out
and
is
telling
everybody
all
out
i
have
been
to
the
shop
for
a
week
what
do
you
mean
ackroyd
checked
some
impulsive
words
and
recommenced
gravely
here
totty
will
you
please
tell
me
in
plain
words
what
you
supposed
i
was
asking
you
about
on
tuesday
night
right
it
nothing
to
me
you
found
out
somehow
that
thyrza
was
foolish
enough
to
want
to
have
you
instead
of
grail
and
so
you
was
so
kind
as
to
come
and
tell
me
i
quite
understood
there
no
need
of
saying
beg
your
pardon
you
may
go
your
way
and
i
go
mine
you
mean
to
say
you
believed
that
well
i
do
wonder
at
you
being
in
the
sulks
and
that
why
you
send
lydia
to
me
to
ask
about
thyrza
by
the
lord
if
i
ever
heard
the
like
of
that
well
i
got
a
fair
lot
of
cheek
but
i
could
quite
manage
that
what
you
mean
she
cried
angrily
nothing
at
all
but
what
did
mean
by
saying
you
knew
all
about
it
as
much
as
you
did
she
answered
coldly
then
we
both
meant
nothing
i
say
totty
you
wo
you
please
to
tell
me
what
you
mean
he
was
about
to
answer
lightly
but
altered
his
intention
and
said
ca
do
that
it
not
my
business
you
please
i
shall
go
and
ask
bower
what
going
on
ca
prevent
you
but
listen
here
totty
if
you
repeat
what
they
tell
you
if
you
repeat
it
once
you
not
the
girl
i
thought
you
it
more
than
half
a
cursed
lie
and
you
ca
tell
one
half
the
story
without
meaning
the
other
shall
know
what
to
think
when
i
heard
it
ackroyd
and
as
to
repeating
i
shall
do
as
i
think
fit
here
when
you
heard
that
story
you
just
go
and
say
to
everybody
that
ever
mentions
it
to
you
that
it
a
lie
from
beginning
to
end
you
understand
me
shall
do
as
i
please
you
do
as
please
and
who
made
you
my
master
mr
ackroyd
nothing
more
to
say
but
you
heard
me
and
you
do
it
because
your
own
heart
tell
you
it
the
right
thing
to
do
i
often
use
words
like
that
but
i
mean
it
she
allowed
him
to
walk
away
chapter
xxv
a
bird
of
the
air
when
paula
had
been
three
or
four
days
wedded
it
occurred
to
her
to
examine
her
husband
countenance
they
were
at
breakfast
at
biarritz
and
certain
words
that
fell
from
dalmaine
as
he
sat
sideways
from
the
table
with
his
newspaper
led
her
eyes
to
rest
for
a
few
moments
on
his
face
he
was
smiling
but
with
depressed
brows
paula
noted
the
smile
well
and
it
occupied
her
thoughts
now
and
then
during
the
day
she
was
rather
in
want
of
something
to
think
of
just
then
feeling
a
little
lonely
and
wishing
her
mother
or
her
brother
or
somebody
whom
she
really
knew
were
at
hand
to
talk
to
it
was
with
that
same
peculiar
smile
the
bushy
eyebrows
closing
together
the
lips
very
tight
that
her
husband
approached
her
late
one
evening
in
the
first
week
of
may
they
were
in
their
house
in
kensington
now
there
had
been
a
dinner
party
the
last
guest
was
gone
and
paula
sat
in
the
thinking
how
she
had
impressed
a
certain
polite
old
member
of
parliament
a
man
whom
it
was
worth
while
impressing
dalmaine
took
a
seat
near
her
and
leaned
forward
with
his
hands
clasped
between
his
knees
he
asked
were
you
saying
to
puggerton
when
i
passed
and
looked
at
you
you
remember
something
about
working
men
and
intelligent
voting
i
was
telling
that
tale
of
yours
about
the
candidate
whose
name
was
beere
and
who
got
in
so
easily
for
thought
so
he
remarked
before
she
had
finished
you
went
on
to
say
that
i
thought
it
a
pity
that
there
were
not
more
men
on
our
side
with
names
of
similar
sound
i
did
puggerton
laughed
ever
so
much
paula
my
dear
i
think
it
wo
be
amiss
if
you
leave
off
talking
about
politics
i
sure
i
been
talking
very
cleverly
all
the
evening
liggs
said
i
was
an
acquisition
to
something
i
forget
what
doubt
for
all
that
i
think
you
had
better
give
your
attention
to
other
things
in
fact
it
not
a
polite
thing
to
say
but
making
a
fool
of
yourself
paula
features
hardened
she
looked
very
beautiful
tonight
and
had
in
truth
been
charming
her
appearance
suffered
when
the
delicate
curves
of
her
face
fell
into
hard
lines
it
was
noteworthy
that
the
smile
her
husband
now
wore
always
caused
this
change
in
her
expression
glad
you
know
that
it
is
polite
she
answered
sourly
often
need
to
be
told
hope
not
but
you
try
my
patience
a
little
now
and
then
surely
better
that
i
should
save
you
from
making
these
ridiculous
mistakes
once
or
twice
this
week
i
heard
most
absurd
remarks
of
yours
repeated
please
remember
that
it
is
only
yourself
you
stultify
politics
may
be
a
joke
for
you
for
me
it
is
a
serious
pursuit
i
must
have
people
associating
my
name
with
all
kinds
of
nonsensical
chatter
i
have
a
career
before
me
paula
he
said
it
with
dignity
resting
a
hand
on
each
knee
and
letting
his
smile
fade
into
a
look
of
ministerial
importance
are
you
ashamed
of
having
your
stories
repeated
i
told
you
that
when
when
i
did
think
of
the
need
of
measuring
my
words
with
you
i
been
more
cautious
lately
if
you
had
any
understanding
for
such
things
at
all
i
could
explain
that
a
trifle
like
that
might
be
made
to
tell
heavily
against
me
by
some
political
enemy
once
more
if
you
are
drawn
into
talk
of
that
kind
you
must
always
speak
of
working
people
with
the
utmost
respect
with
reverence
no
matter
how
intimate
a
friend
you
may
be
speaking
with
even
with
your
mother
or
your
father
paula
laughed
think
papa
would
believe
me
if
i
told
him
i
reverenced
working
men
the
free
and
independent
electors
again
that
a
phrase
you
must
use
i
say
it
absolutely
you
must
forget
the
phrase
yes
your
father
must
believe
you
you
think
he
believes
dalmaine
drew
himself
up
do
know
what
you
mean
paula
i
do
know
what
mean
you
are
ridiculous
me
that
is
the
word
that
applies
to
you
however
i
have
no
wish
to
wrangle
let
it
be
understood
that
you
gradually
abandon
conversation
such
as
this
of
for
the
sake
of
appearances
you
must
make
no
sudden
and
obvious
change
if
you
take
my
advice
cultivate
talk
of
a
light
fashionable
kind
literature
you
interfere
with
i
should
advise
you
to
say
much
about
art
except
that
of
course
you
may
admire
the
pictures
at
the
grosvenor
gallery
you
better
read
the
society
journals
carefully
in
fact
keep
to
the
sphere
which
is
distinctly
womanly
what
about
your
anxiety
to
see
women
take
part
in
politics
are
exceptions
to
every
rule
and
the
programme
of
the
platform
be
good
enough
to
try
and
understand
does
always
apply
to
domestic
circumstances
if
one
happens
to
have
married
a
very
pretty
and
delightful
girl
of
course
repeat
a
very
pretty
and
charming
girl
with
no
turn
whatever
for
seriousness
one
ca
pretend
to
offer
an
instance
in
one
own
house
of
the
political
woman
once
more
understand
in
england
politics
must
be
pursued
with
gravity
we
do
fly
about
and
chatter
and
scream
like
frenchmen
no
man
will
succeed
with
us
in
politics
who
has
not
a
reputation
for
solid
earnestness
therefore
the
more
stupid
a
man
the
better
chance
he
has
i
am
naturally
fond
of
a
joke
but
to
get
a
name
for
that
kind
of
thing
would
ruin
me
you
are
clever
paula
very
clever
in
your
way
but
you
do
and
you
never
will
understand
politics
i
beg
of
you
not
to
damage
my
prospects
cultivate
a
safe
habit
of
speech
you
may
talk
of
the
events
of
the
season
of
pigeon
shooting
of
horse
racing
of
the
prince
and
princess
of
wales
and
so
on
it
what
everybody
expects
in
a
fashionable
lady
of
course
if
you
been
able
to
take
up
politics
in
earnest
but
never
mind
i
like
you
very
well
as
you
are
how
well
you
look
in
that
dress
rather
think
you
right
paula
remarked
after
a
short
pause
turning
about
a
bracelet
on
her
wrist
be
better
if
you
go
your
way
and
i
go
mine
though
that
an
unkind
way
of
putting
it
he
sat
looking
at
the
ground
and
a
smile
of
another
kind
came
to
his
face
i
something
to
tell
you
something
that
amuse
you
very
much
and
that
you
talk
about
just
as
much
as
you
like
she
made
no
reply
friend
egremont
has
come
out
in
a
new
part
his
first
appearance
in
it
absolutely
though
he
ca
be
said
to
have
created
the
he
run
away
with
a
girl
from
lambeth
in
fact
the
girl
who
was
just
going
to
be
married
to
his
man
his
librarian
paula
looked
up
in
astonishment
then
with
indignant
incredulity
she
said
do
you
mean
what
your
object
in
talking
nonsense
of
that
kind
and
again
i
have
to
tell
you
that
i
never
talk
nonsense
i
am
a
politician
i
heard
the
news
this
morning
from
tasker
the
man
grail
egremont
librarian
was
to
have
been
married
two
days
ago
monday
last
friday
night
his
disappeared
she
a
very
pretty
girl
tasker
tells
me
wonderfully
pretty
for
one
in
her
position
a
egremont
seems
to
have
thought
it
a
pity
to
let
her
be
wasted
he
been
meeting
her
secretly
for
some
time
in
the
library
of
all
places
whilst
the
man
grail
was
at
work
poor
fellow
and
at
last
he
carried
her
off
there
no
getting
on
his
track
told
the
question
is
what
will
become
of
the
embryo
library
the
whole
thing
about
the
finest
joke
i
heard
for
some
time
paula
had
reddened
her
eyes
flashed
anger
do
know
whether
you
invented
it
she
said
whether
your
secretary
has
but
i
know
there
is
one
word
of
truth
in
it
dear
child
it
no
invention
at
all
the
affair
is
the
common
talk
of
lambeth
do
you
mean
to
say
egremont
has
married
this
girl
i
do
know
that
we
discuss
that
point
dalmaine
replied
twiddling
his
thumbs
no
information
to
hand
do
believe
it
i
tell
you
i
do
believe
it
egremont
is
engaged
to
my
cousin
annabel
and
besides
he
could
do
such
a
thing
he
is
a
man
of
that
kind
experience
of
men
is
not
great
my
dear
paula
do
care
i
know
egremont
even
if
you
said
he
married
her
it
is
true
you
must
judge
every
man
by
were
going
to
say
she
rose
and
swept
her
train
over
a
few
yards
of
floor
then
she
came
back
and
stood
before
him
tell
me
that
people
are
saying
this
considerable
number
of
my
respected
constituents
and
their
wives
are
saying
it
tasker
shall
give
you
judicial
evidence
if
you
please
sure
i
not
going
to
talk
to
tasker
i
dislike
him
too
much
to
believe
a
word
he
says
course
but
he
is
absolutely
trustworthy
i
called
at
this
afternoon
to
make
sure
that
he
was
away
from
home
now
there
is
something
for
you
to
talk
about
paula
shall
take
very
good
care
that
i
do
speak
a
word
of
it
to
anyone
it
contemptible
to
make
up
such
a
story
about
a
man
just
because
you
dislike
him
seemed
to
me
that
you
were
not
remarkably
fond
of
him
two
months
or
so
ago
it
she
said
sarcastically
i
know
little
of
men
certain
you
do
know
much
more
of
women
he
leaned
back
and
laughed
and
whilst
he
laughed
paula
quitted
the
room
paula
still
kept
up
her
habit
of
after
breakfast
next
morning
she
sat
in
her
pretty
boudoir
writing
to
annabel
after
sentences
referring
to
annabel
expected
arrival
in
london
for
the
season
she
added
this
very
shocking
story
has
just
come
to
my
ears
i
ought
really
to
repeat
it
to
you
dear
and
yet
in
another
way
it
is
my
duty
to
egremont
has
disappeared
and
with
him
the
girl
who
was
just
going
to
marry
his
librarian
the
poor
man
you
know
of
from
him
there
are
no
means
of
knowing
whether
they
have
run
away
together
to
be
married
or
not
everybody
knows
about
it
it
is
the
talk
of
lambeth
my
husband
heard
of
it
at
once
the
girl
is
said
to
be
very
i
wish
i
could
refuse
to
believe
it
but
is
no
doubt
you
ought
to
know
at
once
but
perhaps
you
will
have
heard
already
i
never
knew
anything
more
dreadful
and
i
ca
say
what
i
feel
there
was
not
much
more
in
the
letter
having
fastened
up
the
envelope
paula
let
it
lie
on
her
desk
whilst
she
walked
about
the
room
each
time
she
passed
the
desk
she
looked
at
the
letter
and
lingered
a
little
once
she
took
it
up
and
seemed
about
to
open
it
again
her
expression
all
this
time
was
very
strange
her
colour
came
and
went
she
bit
her
lips
and
twisted
her
fingers
together
at
length
she
rang
the
bell
and
when
the
servant
came
gave
the
letter
to
be
posted
immediately
five
minutes
later
she
was
in
her
bedroom
sitting
in
a
low
chair
crying
like
a
very
unhappy
child
the
letter
reached
eastbourne
two
days
before
that
appointed
for
the
departure
of
annabel
and
her
father
for
london
they
had
accepted
tyrrell
invitation
to
her
house
newthorpe
might
remain
only
a
fortnight
or
might
stay
through
the
season
but
annabel
would
not
come
back
to
eastbourne
before
august
she
said
little
but
her
father
saw
with
what
pleasure
she
anticipated
this
change
he
wondered
whether
it
would
do
her
good
or
harm
her
books
lay
almost
unused
of
late
she
had
attended
chiefly
to
music
in
such
hours
as
were
not
spent
out
of
doors
newthorpe
health
was
as
far
improved
as
he
could
hope
it
ever
would
be
he
too
looked
forward
to
associating
once
more
with
the
few
friends
he
had
in
london
it
was
in
the
evening
that
annabel
entering
after
a
long
drive
with
her
father
found
paula
letter
she
took
it
from
the
hall
in
passing
to
her
room
at
dinner
she
spoke
very
little
after
the
meal
she
said
that
she
wished
to
walk
over
to
the
chestnuts
she
left
her
father
deep
in
a
french
novel
he
read
much
more
of
the
lighter
literature
now
than
formerly
ormonde
was
upstairs
with
her
children
they
were
singing
to
her
annabel
heard
the
choir
of
young
voices
as
she
entered
the
garden
the
servant
who
went
to
announce
her
brought
back
a
request
that
she
would
ascend
and
hear
a
song
she
did
so
the
last
song
was
to
be
laurie
in
which
the
children
were
perfect
annabel
took
the
offered
seat
without
speaking
and
listened
bessie
bunce
was
near
ormonde
when
the
song
was
over
she
said
like
to
hear
miss
trent
sing
that
again
would
you
mum
i
should
bessie
perhaps
we
shall
have
her
here
again
some
day
ormonde
went
down
with
annabel
to
the
she
was
in
a
happy
mood
and
as
they
descended
together
she
put
her
arm
playfully
about
the
girl
waist
wonder
where
grail
has
taken
her
she
said
ca
get
any
news
from
egremont
i
wrote
to
jersey
and
behold
the
letter
is
returned
to
me
with
and
left
no
address
i
wonder
whether
back
in
town
have
some
news
of
him
annabel
said
quietly
you
there
was
no
reply
till
they
were
in
the
then
annabel
held
out
her
cousin
letter
you
read
that
ormonde
complied
annabel
watching
her
face
the
while
the
girl
looked
for
indignation
for
scornful
disbelief
she
saw
something
quite
different
ormonde
hand
trembled
but
in
a
moment
she
had
overcome
all
weakness
down
dear
she
said
calmly
have
just
received
this
yes
i
see
the
date
annabel
remained
standing
letter
is
returned
from
jersey
she
remarked
with
steady
voice
mentions
no
dates
did
he
go
to
jersey
at
all
have
no
means
of
knowing
save
his
own
declaration
when
he
said
to
me
on
thursday
of
last
week
and
he
told
me
he
was
going
to
his
old
quarters
at
st
aubin
you
give
credit
to
this
mrs
ormonde
i
can
say
nothing
yet
no
i
do
not
believe
it
until
it
is
confirmed
beyond
all
doubt
i
owe
that
to
him
as
you
also
do
it
does
not
seem
to
you
incredible
i
saw
that
on
your
face
thing
suggested
here
is
incredible
wholly
incredible
if
there
is
any
truth
in
the
story
at
all
by
this
time
she
is
his
wife
so
much
we
know
you
and
i
annabel
it
is
possible
that
he
is
in
jersey
the
old
rooms
may
have
been
occupied
people
would
know
where
he
had
gone
i
think
though
if
he
if
he
was
not
alone
probably
he
would
go
to
a
new
place
at
once
he
may
have
told
you
the
truth
in
saying
he
was
going
to
jersey
it
was
needless
to
add
the
untruth
i
did
not
ask
him
where
he
would
live
sit
down
dear
you
i
shall
not
stay
now
i
thought
it
was
better
to
come
to
you
with
this
at
once
please
destroy
the
letter
ormonde
mused
you
still
go
to
your
aunt
she
asked
when
annabel
moved
for
are
taking
the
truth
for
granted
mrs
ormonde
mean
that
we
have
no
way
of
discovering
whether
it
is
true
or
not
will
make
no
change
i
shall
not
speak
of
it
to
father
there
will
be
no
change
in
any
case
again
there
fell
a
short
silence
can
only
wait
in
hope
of
hearing
from
him
ormonde
said
course
if
my
aunt
says
anything
to
me
about
it
i
will
write
to
you
shall
see
you
as
we
arranged
yes
but
please
we
wo
refer
again
to
this
they
parted
as
on
an
ordinary
occasion
but
annabel
did
not
go
home
at
once
she
walked
down
to
the
shore
and
stood
for
a
long
time
looking
upon
the
dim
sea
it
was
the
very
spot
where
thyrza
had
stood
that
sunday
morning
when
she
came
out
in
the
early
sunlight
annabel
had
often
thought
how
fitting
it
was
that
at
this
period
of
her
life
she
should
leave
the
calm
voiceless
shore
of
ullswater
for
the
neighbourhood
of
the
waves
the
sea
had
a
voice
of
craving
and
her
heart
responded
with
desire
for
completion
of
her
being
with
desire
for
love
the
thought
that
she
would
be
near
walter
egremont
had
a
great
part
in
her
anticipation
of
london
she
was
not
hitherto
sure
that
she
loved
him
it
was
rather
me
see
him
again
and
discover
how
his
presence
affects
me
yet
his
manifest
coldness
at
the
last
meeting
had
caused
her
much
vague
heartache
she
blamed
herself
for
being
so
cold
was
it
not
natural
that
he
should
take
his
tone
from
her
he
would
naturally
watch
to
see
how
she
bore
herself
to
him
and
remembering
ullswater
he
could
not
press
for
more
than
she
seemed
ready
to
give
yet
her
reserve
had
been
involuntary
assuredly
she
was
not
then
moved
with
a
longing
to
recover
what
she
had
rejected
there
was
a
change
after
the
meeting
with
thyrza
trent
it
seemed
to
her
very
foolish
to
remember
so
persistently
that
egremont
had
said
nothing
of
the
girl
strange
loveliness
yet
she
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
omission
as
something
significant
she
even
recollected
that
in
speaking
to
her
of
thyrza
he
had
turned
his
eyes
seaward
such
trifles
could
mean
nothing
as
regarded
egremont
but
how
in
reference
to
herself
how
if
she
knew
that
he
had
given
his
love
to
another
woman
i
think
that
would
be
hard
to
bear
and
it
was
hard
to
bear
passion
had
won
it
over
everything
he
had
taken
thyrza
at
the
eleventh
hour
and
now
she
was
married
to
him
she
did
not
doubt
it
she
felt
that
ormonde
did
not
doubt
it
it
meant
something
that
failure
to
speak
of
the
girl
beauty
that
evasion
with
the
eyes
the
night
was
cold
but
she
sat
down
by
the
shore
and
let
her
head
droop
as
she
listened
to
the
she
could
love
him
now
that
it
was
in
vain
she
knew
now
the
warm
yearning
for
his
presence
which
at
ullswater
had
never
troubled
her
and
it
was
too
late
no
tears
came
to
her
eyes
she
did
not
even
breathe
a
deeper
breath
most
likely
it
would
pass
without
a
single
outbreak
of
grief
and
perhaps
the
thought
of
another
misery
somewhat
dulled
the
edge
of
her
own
gilbert
grail
was
only
a
name
to
her
but
he
lived
very
vividly
in
her
imagination
of
course
she
had
idealised
him
as
was
natural
in
a
woman
thinking
of
a
man
who
has
been
represented
to
her
as
full
of
native
nobleness
for
him
as
for
herself
her
heart
was
heavy
she
knew
that
he
must
return
to
his
hated
and
how
would
it
now
be
embittered
what
anguish
of
resentment
what
despair
of
frustrate
passion
she
wished
she
could
know
him
and
take
his
hand
and
soothe
him
with
a
woman
tenderness
his
lot
was
harder
than
hers
nay
it
was
mockery
to
compare
them
annabel
rose
murmuring
old
words
i
praised
the
dead
which
are
already
dead
more
than
the
living
which
are
yet
alive
yea
better
is
he
than
both
they
which
hath
not
yet
been
who
hath
not
seen
the
evil
work
which
is
done
under
the
sun
chapter
xxvi
idealist
and
his
friend
egremont
alighted
one
evening
at
charing
cross
he
came
direct
from
paris
and
was
alone
his
absence
from
england
had
extended
over
a
fortnight
he
did
not
look
better
for
his
travels
one
in
the
crowd
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
train
might
have
supposed
that
he
had
suffered
on
the
and
was
not
yet
quite
recovered
having
bidden
a
porter
look
after
the
bag
which
was
his
only
luggage
he
walked
to
the
to
buy
a
periodical
that
he
wished
to
take
home
with
him
and
there
he
came
face
to
face
with
two
people
whom
he
knew
dalmaine
was
just
turning
from
the
stall
with
an
evening
paper
and
by
his
side
was
paula
egremont
had
not
seen
either
since
their
marriage
the
three
pairs
of
eyes
focussed
on
one
point
egremont
saluted
did
it
nervously
for
he
was
prepared
for
nothing
less
than
an
encounter
with
acquaintances
he
saw
a
smile
come
to
paula
face
he
saw
her
on
the
point
of
extending
her
hand
then
to
his
amazement
he
heard
a
sharp
from
dalmaine
and
husband
and
wife
turned
from
him
it
was
the
cut
direct
or
would
have
been
but
for
that
little
piece
of
impulsiveness
on
paula
part
the
two
walked
towards
one
of
the
platforms
and
it
was
plain
that
dalmaine
was
delivering
himself
in
an
undertone
of
a
gentlemanly
reproof
he
stood
disconcerted
what
might
this
mean
was
it
merely
an
urbane
way
of
reminding
him
that
he
had
neglected
certain
civilities
demanded
by
the
social
code
dalmaine
would
doubtless
be
punctilious
he
was
a
rising
politician
yet
the
insult
was
too
pronounced
it
suggested
some
grave
ground
of
offence
as
the
cab
bore
him
homewards
he
felt
that
this
was
an
ominous
event
for
the
moment
of
his
return
to
london
he
had
had
no
heart
to
come
back
from
the
steamer
he
had
gazed
sadly
on
the
sunny
shores
of
france
and
on
landing
at
dover
the
island
air
was
hard
to
breathe
yet
harder
the
air
of
london
streets
the
meeting
in
the
station
became
a
symbol
of
stiff
awkward
pretentious
anglicism
he
had
unkind
sentiments
towards
his
native
country
and
asked
himself
how
he
was
going
to
live
in
england
henceforth
his
room
in
great
russell
street
seemed
to
have
suffered
neglect
during
his
absence
his
return
was
unexpected
everything
seemed
unhomely
and
unwelcoming
the
great
front
of
the
british
museum
frowned
as
if
to
express
disapproval
of
such
aimless
running
hither
and
thither
in
one
who
should
be
spending
his
days
soberly
and
strenuously
even
the
pigeons
walked
or
flew
with
balance
of
purpose
with
english
respectability
it
seemed
to
have
rained
all
day
the
evening
sky
was
heavy
and
featureless
the
landlady
presented
herself
she
was
grieved
exceedingly
that
she
had
not
known
of
egremont
coming
but
everything
should
be
made
comfortable
in
less
than
no
time
he
would
have
a
fire
to
be
sure
it
was
a
little
chilly
though
really
has
come
upon
us
all
at
a
jump
whilst
you
been
away
sir
got
your
telegram
sir
that
i
was
to
send
any
letters
on
gentlemen
have
called
and
i
who
has
called
sir
on
the
day
after
you
went
i
dare
say
it
was
nine
in
the
evening
or
a
little
later
someone
came
wishing
very
much
to
see
you
he
would
give
a
name
i
do
think
it
was
a
gentleman
it
seemed
like
somebody
coming
on
business
he
was
very
anxious
to
have
your
address
of
course
i
did
give
it
i
just
said
that
any
note
he
liked
to
leave
should
be
forwarded
at
once
dark
man
with
a
beard
a
working
man
doubt
the
one
you
thinking
of
sir
he
called
again
let
me
see
four
or
five
days
after
again
then
it
could
be
the
man
i
mean
he
entered
into
a
fuller
description
of
gilbert
grail
the
landlady
identified
the
caller
as
grail
beyond
all
doubt
day
was
it
sir
it
be
wednesday
yes
wednesday
and
you
told
him
i
had
left
jersey
sir
he
said
he
knew
that
and
that
he
knew
it
repeated
egremont
astonished
sir
and
that
he
wished
to
see
if
you
had
got
home
again
he
been
since
sir
but
i
was
coming
in
a
night
or
two
after
sir
and
i
saw
him
standing
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
looking
at
the
house
he
had
called
however
and
he
did
again
egremont
bent
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
delayed
a
moment
before
asking
else
has
been
gentleman
i
do
know
who
it
was
the
servant
went
to
the
door
he
said
he
only
wished
to
know
if
you
were
in
town
or
not
he
leave
a
name
egremont
face
changed
to
annoyance
he
did
not
care
to
pursue
the
subject
me
have
something
to
eat
please
he
said
the
landlady
having
withdrawn
he
at
once
sat
down
to
his
desk
and
wrote
a
note
it
was
to
grail
and
ran
in
substance
am
just
back
from
the
continent
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
it
is
you
who
have
called
here
twice
in
my
absence
if
so
your
second
call
was
at
a
time
when
i
hoped
you
were
out
of
london
do
let
me
see
you
as
soon
as
possible
of
course
you
received
my
letter
from
jersey
shall
i
come
to
you
or
will
you
come
here
i
will
stay
in
i
send
this
by
a
messenger
as
i
wish
you
to
receive
it
immediately
the
landlady
had
a
son
at
home
a
lad
of
sixteen
having
discovered
that
the
boy
services
were
available
egremont
gave
him
directions
he
was
to
take
a
cab
and
drive
to
the
library
in
brook
street
if
he
should
not
find
grail
there
he
was
to
proceed
to
walnut
tree
walk
if
grail
would
come
back
with
him
so
much
the
better
walter
was
left
to
refresh
himself
after
his
journey
he
changed
his
clothes
and
presently
sat
down
to
a
meal
but
appetite
by
this
time
failed
him
he
had
the
table
cleared
ten
minutes
after
it
was
laid
he
was
in
the
utmost
uneasiness
could
it
be
grail
who
had
called
he
tried
to
assure
himself
that
it
must
be
a
mistake
how
could
grail
expect
him
to
be
in
town
after
reading
that
letter
from
jersey
if
indeed
the
visitor
were
gilbert
some
catastrophe
had
befallen
but
he
would
not
entertain
such
a
fear
then
the
second
caller
that
might
be
any
acquaintance
still
it
was
strange
that
he
too
had
refused
his
name
you
know
the
state
of
mind
in
which
whatever
one
thinks
of
a
pain
a
fear
draws
the
thought
another
way
it
was
so
with
egremont
the
two
mysterious
callers
and
the
annoying
scene
at
the
railway
station
plagued
him
successively
and
for
background
to
them
all
was
a
shadow
of
indefinite
apprehension
he
could
scarcely
endure
his
impatience
it
seemed
as
though
the
messenger
would
never
return
the
lad
presented
himself
however
without
undue
delay
he
had
found
grail
he
said
at
the
second
address
whom
did
you
see
in
brook
street
woman
sir
she
said
grail
did
live
there
could
come
with
you
sir
but
he
said
he
come
very
soon
you
that
will
do
so
grail
was
at
the
library
then
of
a
certainty
something
had
happened
thyrza
was
ill
perhaps
he
walked
about
the
room
that
dread
physical
pain
which
clutches
at
all
the
inner
parts
when
one
is
waiting
in
agonised
impatience
for
that
which
will
be
misery
when
it
comes
racked
him
so
that
at
moments
he
had
to
lean
for
support
he
felt
how
the
suffering
of
the
last
fortnight
in
vain
fled
from
hither
and
thither
had
reduced
his
strength
since
he
took
leave
of
thyrza
he
had
not
known
one
moment
of
calm
when
passion
was
merciful
for
a
time
fear
had
taken
its
turn
to
torment
him
it
had
not
availed
to
demonstrate
to
himself
that
fear
be
groundless
love
from
of
old
has
had
a
comrade
superstition
if
he
awoke
from
a
wretched
dream
he
interpreted
it
as
sympathy
with
thyrza
in
some
dreadful
trial
and
behold
he
had
been
right
his
flight
had
profited
nothing
woe
had
come
upon
her
he
loved
and
upon
the
man
he
most
desired
to
befriend
half
an
hour
after
the
return
of
the
messenger
the
servant
came
to
the
door
and
said
that
grail
was
below
i
see
him
he
spoke
the
words
with
difficulty
he
advanced
to
the
middle
of
the
room
gilbert
came
in
and
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
the
man
looked
as
if
he
had
risen
from
his
to
obey
this
summons
the
flesh
of
his
face
had
shrunk
and
left
the
lines
of
his
countenance
sharp
his
were
cavernous
the
dark
eyes
had
an
unnatural
lustre
his
hair
and
beard
were
abandoned
to
neglect
his
garments
hung
with
strange
looseness
about
him
he
stood
there
just
within
the
door
his
gaze
fixed
on
egremont
a
gaze
wherein
suspicion
and
reproach
and
all
unutterable
woe
were
blended
walter
took
a
step
forward
vainly
holding
out
his
hand
what
has
happened
you
are
what
does
it
mean
have
you
sent
for
me
mr
egremont
the
question
was
uttered
with
some
sternness
but
bodily
weakness
subdued
the
voice
which
shook
and
when
he
had
spoken
his
eyes
fell
i
want
to
know
what
is
the
matter
egremont
replied
in
quick
unnerved
tones
you
been
here
to
try
and
see
me
i
have
you
knew
i
was
away
what
has
happened
grail
thought
you
knew
mr
egremont
should
i
know
i
have
heard
nothing
from
london
for
a
fortnight
you
speak
to
me
in
an
unfriendly
way
tell
me
at
once
what
you
mean
gilbert
looked
up
for
a
moment
looked
indignantly
bitterly
but
his
eyes
drooped
again
as
he
spoke
fortnight
ago
miss
trent
left
her
home
and
we
can
hear
nothing
of
her
i
tried
to
find
you
because
i
had
reason
to
think
that
you
knew
where
she
was
walter
felt
it
as
a
relief
he
had
waited
for
something
worse
only
could
occupy
itself
with
the
charge
distinctly
made
against
him
he
said
as
soon
as
he
could
command
his
voice
were
wrong
in
thinking
so
i
know
nothing
of
miss
trent
i
have
no
idea
where
she
can
have
gone
it
was
only
when
he
found
grail
eyes
fixed
upon
him
that
he
added
after
a
pause
were
the
reasons
that
led
you
to
think
so
know
nothing
gilbert
said
slowly
whatever
how
could
you
think
i
did
i
do
understand
you
walter
was
not
used
to
speak
untruthfully
he
knew
all
this
time
that
a
man
upon
whom
a
charge
such
as
this
had
come
as
a
sheer
surprise
would
have
met
it
with
quite
other
face
and
accent
remembering
all
that
had
passed
between
thyrza
and
himself
remembering
all
that
he
had
undergone
all
that
he
had
at
one
moment
proposed
he
could
not
express
the
astonishment
which
would
have
given
evidence
on
his
behalf
as
yet
he
had
not
even
tried
to
affect
indignation
for
it
was
against
his
nature
to
play
the
hypocrite
he
knew
that
his
manner
was
all
but
a
tacit
admission
that
appearances
were
against
him
but
agitation
drove
him
to
the
brink
of
anger
and
when
gilbert
stood
mute
with
veiled
eyes
he
continued
impetuously
tell
you
that
you
have
amazed
me
by
your
news
are
you
accusing
me
of
something
you
must
speak
more
plainly
do
you
mean
that
suspicion
has
fallen
upon
me
how
i
do
i
ca
understand
you
thought
you
would
understand
me
gilbert
replied
gravely
not
offensively
with
far
more
dignity
than
the
other
had
been
able
to
preserve
things
compelled
me
to
believe
that
you
knew
of
her
leaving
us
i
was
told
of
your
meetings
with
her
at
the
library
he
paused
like
egremont
he
could
not
speak
his
whole
thought
whilst
there
remained
a
possibility
that
egremont
indeed
knew
nothing
of
thyrza
disappearance
he
might
not
strengthen
his
case
by
making
use
of
the
girl
confession
to
her
sister
he
could
only
make
use
of
outward
circumstances
meetings
at
the
library
egremont
repeated
do
you
think
they
had
any
meaning
that
i
ca
at
once
and
freely
explain
to
you
it
was
the
idlest
folly
on
my
part
i
had
a
plan
that
i
would
get
books
on
to
the
shelves
that
week
and
at
the
end
of
it
take
you
there
and
surprise
you
did
i
imply
that
in
my
letter
to
you
from
jersey
it
was
childish
of
course
on
the
monday
miss
trent
surprised
me
at
work
she
had
happened
to
see
a
box
being
brought
in
and
naturally
came
to
see
what
was
going
on
i
was
unthinking
enough
to
ask
her
to
keep
the
secret
by
allowing
her
to
help
me
i
encouraged
her
to
come
again
the
next
day
so
much
was
wholly
my
fault
but
surely
not
a
very
grave
one
do
you
imagine
grail
that
anything
passed
between
us
on
those
two
mornings
which
you
might
not
have
heard
how
is
it
possible
for
you
for
to
pass
from
the
fact
of
that
foolish
secret
to
such
suspicions
as
these
in
the
pause
gilbert
offered
no
word
who
told
you
about
it
evidently
someone
bent
on
mischief
again
a
pause
gilbert
stood
unmoving
still
suspect
me
you
think
i
am
lying
to
you
do
you
know
me
no
better
than
that
it
rang
false
it
rang
false
his
own
voice
sounded
to
him
as
that
of
an
actor
who
does
his
poor
best
to
be
forcible
and
pathetic
yet
what
lie
had
he
told
could
he
say
all
he
thought
he
had
read
in
eyes
there
was
the
parting
that
night
beyond
lambeth
bridge
how
could
he
speak
of
that
was
he
himself
not
absolutely
innocent
had
he
not
by
a
desperate
struggle
avoided
as
much
as
a
glance
of
tenderness
at
the
girl
for
whom
he
was
mad
with
love
gilbert
spoke
at
length
find
it
very
hard
to
believe
that
you
know
nothing
more
there
are
other
things
as
soon
as
we
knew
that
she
was
gone
that
friday
night
i
came
here
to
ask
for
you
why
why
to
me
she
had
been
seen
with
you
at
the
library
and
people
had
begun
to
talk
they
told
me
you
were
gone
and
i
asked
for
your
address
they
would
give
it
me
meant
nothing
whatever
it
was
merely
my
landlady
idea
of
her
responsibility
to
me
that
may
be
on
saturday
night
a
letter
came
from
you
from
jersey
was
that
the
kind
of
letter
i
could
have
written
if
i
had
been
such
a
traitor
to
you
do
know
what
the
letter
would
have
seemed
to
me
if
i
had
been
able
to
judge
it
with
my
ordinary
mind
i
could
i
was
going
through
too
much
i
believed
it
false
on
monday
i
went
to
southampton
and
from
there
at
night
to
jersey
it
was
the
earliest
that
i
could
get
there
went
to
jersey
had
no
choice
i
had
to
see
you
and
i
found
you
had
gone
away
on
saturday
morning
gone
to
france
it
was
only
saturday
night
that
i
got
your
letter
there
was
no
word
in
it
about
going
to
france
instead
of
that
you
said
plainly
that
you
would
be
in
jersey
for
a
week
or
more
is
true
i
see
how
i
have
made
evidence
against
myself
he
said
it
with
impatience
but
at
once
added
in
a
steadier
voice
wrote
the
letter
and
posted
it
on
friday
night
when
i
had
only
been
at
aubin
half
a
day
the
very
next
morning
i
was
compelled
by
restlessness
to
give
up
my
idea
of
remaining
there
when
i
wrote
to
you
i
had
no
thought
of
leaving
the
island
how
pleasant
it
was
to
be
able
to
speak
with
unshadowed
veracity
walter
all
but
smiled
and
when
the
other
made
no
reply
he
went
on
in
a
voice
almost
of
pleading
believe
this
is
your
mind
so
set
against
me
that
you
will
accuse
me
of
any
cowardice
rather
than
credit
my
word
a
change
came
over
gilbert
face
it
was
wrung
with
pain
and
as
he
looked
up
it
seemed
to
cost
him
a
horrible
effort
to
speak
he
said
a
moment
of
temptation
you
did
her
the
greatest
wrong
that
a
man
can
do
to
a
woman
you
would
perhaps
say
and
do
anything
rather
than
confess
it
walter
tried
to
meet
those
eyes
steadily
but
failed
he
broke
forth
into
passionate
means
you
think
the
worst
of
me
that
one
man
can
think
of
another
you
are
wrong
you
are
basely
wrong
you
speak
of
a
moment
of
temptation
suppose
me
to
have
suffered
that
what
sort
of
temptation
do
you
suppose
would
have
assailed
me
a
man
is
tempted
according
to
his
fibre
do
you
class
me
with
those
who
can
only
be
tempted
by
base
suggestions
what
reason
have
i
ever
given
you
to
think
of
me
so
suppose
me
to
have
been
tempted
you
conclude
that
i
must
have
aimed
at
stealing
the
girl
from
you
solely
to
gratify
myself
heedless
of
her
heedless
of
you
such
a
motive
as
that
is
to
outweigh
every
higher
instinct
i
possess
to
blind
me
to
past
and
future
to
make
me
all
at
once
a
heartless
unimaginative
brute
that
is
your
view
of
my
character
grail
gilbert
had
not
the
appearance
of
a
man
who
listens
since
entering
the
room
he
had
not
moved
from
the
spot
where
he
stood
and
now
with
his
head
again
drooping
he
seemed
sunk
in
a
reverie
of
the
profoundest
sadness
but
he
heard
and
he
strove
to
believe
a
fortnight
ago
he
would
not
have
thought
it
possible
for
walter
egremont
to
speak
a
word
of
which
the
sincerity
would
seem
doubtful
since
then
he
had
spent
days
and
nights
such
as
sap
the
foundations
of
a
man
moral
being
and
shake
convictions
which
appeared
impregnable
the
catastrophe
which
had
come
upon
him
was
proportionate
in
its
effects
to
the
immeasurable
happiness
which
preceded
it
remember
that
it
was
not
only
the
imaginary
wrong
from
which
his
mind
suffered
the
fact
that
thyrza
loved
egremont
was
in
itself
an
agony
almost
enough
to
threaten
his
reason
his
love
was
not
demonstrative
perhaps
he
did
not
himself
know
all
its
force
until
jealousy
taught
him
how
think
you
did
he
spend
that
night
on
the
channel
voyaging
from
southampton
to
jersey
what
sort
of
companions
were
the
winds
and
waves
as
he
paced
the
deck
in
the
dim
light
before
dawn
straining
his
eyes
for
the
first
sight
of
land
to
the
end
of
all
things
that
night
would
remain
with
him
a
ghastly
memory
and
since
then
he
had
not
known
one
full
hour
of
forgetfulness
the
days
and
the
nights
had
succeeded
each
other
as
in
a
his
body
had
wasted
his
mind
ever
renewed
its
capability
of
anguish
with
all
appearances
against
egremont
could
he
preserve
the
nice
balance
of
his
judgment
through
an
experience
such
as
this
had
he
seen
egremont
at
once
after
thyrza
disappearance
it
would
not
have
been
so
hard
for
him
to
credit
the
denial
the
blow
was
not
felt
to
its
full
until
the
night
had
passed
thyrza
exculpation
of
egremont
would
then
have
been
strong
upon
the
latter
side
but
the
fruitless
journey
frenzied
him
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
avoid
the
belief
that
the
letter
had
been
contrived
to
deceive
him
all
the
suspicions
he
had
entertained
grew
darker
as
his
suffering
increased
his
meeting
with
egremont
at
the
end
of
newport
street
on
the
wednesday
night
seemed
to
him
beyond
doubt
condemnatory
he
remembered
the
young
man
haste
and
obvious
agitation
then
thyrza
words
ceased
to
have
weight
he
thought
them
due
to
her
desire
to
avert
suspicion
from
her
lover
and
now
that
he
was
at
length
face
to
face
with
the
man
whom
in
his
lonely
woe
he
had
cursed
as
the
falsest
friend
his
ear
was
keen
to
detect
every
note
of
treachery
his
eyes
read
egremont
countenance
with
preternatural
keenness
walter
could
not
sustain
such
proof
his
agitation
spoke
against
him
only
when
he
at
length
passed
from
uncertain
argument
and
pleading
to
scornful
repudiation
of
the
charge
did
his
utterances
awake
in
the
hearer
the
old
associations
of
sincerity
and
nobleness
how
many
a
night
gilbert
had
hung
on
every
word
that
fell
from
him
could
he
speak
thus
and
be
no
more
than
a
contemptible
hypocrite
walter
paused
for
a
few
moments
when
no
reply
came
he
continued
with
the
same
warmth
have
told
you
that
on
those
two
mornings
when
she
was
with
me
in
the
library
no
word
passed
between
us
that
you
might
not
have
heard
it
is
true
but
one
thing
i
did
say
to
her
which
doubtless
would
not
have
been
said
in
your
presence
she
was
speaking
to
me
as
if
to
a
superior
i
begged
her
to
let
there
be
an
end
of
that
and
to
allow
me
to
call
myself
her
friend
i
meant
it
in
the
purest
sense
and
in
that
sense
she
understood
it
if
i
was
wrong
in
taking
that
freedom
with
her
at
least
there
was
no
thought
of
wrong
in
my
mind
met
her
on
wednesday
night
in
that
week
gilbert
said
speaking
with
uncertain
voice
night
that
you
saw
me
and
said
you
had
been
to
bunce
you
know
of
that
from
some
spy
her
enemy
and
mine
or
how
know
it
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
met
her
that
night
not
by
appointment
as
you
suppose
it
was
by
mere
chance
as
i
came
away
from
bunce
house
i
told
her
i
was
leaving
town
next
day
and
i
said
to
her
again
not
a
syllable
was
uttered
that
any
one
might
not
have
heard
you
coming
away
from
her
then
when
i
saw
you
gilbert
asked
in
a
hard
voice
not
straight
from
her
as
is
wont
to
be
the
case
with
us
when
we
have
recourse
to
equivocation
egremont
thought
that
he
read
in
his
rival
countenance
a
scornful
surmise
of
the
truth
as
is
also
wont
to
happen
this
sense
of
detection
heated
his
blood
and
for
a
moment
he
could
have
found
pleasure
in
flinging
out
an
angry
defiance
but
as
he
looked
grail
in
the
face
the
latter
eyes
fell
and
something
some
slight
movement
of
feature
touching
once
more
walter
sense
of
compassion
shamed
him
from
unworthy
utterance
he
said
in
a
lower
voice
i
yielded
to
temptation
if
i
had
so
far
lost
control
of
myself
as
to
speak
a
word
to
her
which
at
once
and
for
ever
altered
our
relations
do
you
think
i
should
have
tried
to
keep
secret
what
had
happened
do
you
think
i
could
have
conceived
a
desire
which
had
suffering
for
its
end
are
you
so
embittered
that
you
can
imagine
of
me
nothing
better
than
that
you
think
i
could
have
made
my
victim
grail
read
his
face
the
emphasis
of
this
speech
was
deliberate
could
not
be
misunderstood
for
the
first
time
gilbert
turned
and
moved
a
little
apart
walter
had
not
the
exclusive
privilege
of
being
an
idealist
when
at
length
he
spoke
out
of
his
deepest
feeling
when
he
revealed
though
but
indirectly
the
meaning
of
his
agitation
of
his
evasions
and
doubtful
behaviour
he
had
found
the
way
of
convincing
his
hearer
it
was
a
new
blow
to
gilbert
but
it
put
an
end
to
his
darkest
fears
and
to
the
misery
of
his
misjudgment
in
the
silence
that
followed
all
the
details
of
the
story
passed
before
him
with
a
new
significance
the
greatness
of
his
own
love
a
love
which
drew
into
its
service
every
noblest
element
of
his
nature
enabled
him
once
the
obscuring
mists
dispelled
to
interpret
his
rival
mind
with
justice
regarding
egremont
again
he
could
read
aright
the
signs
of
suffering
that
were
on
his
face
it
was
with
a
strange
bitter
joy
that
he
recovered
his
faith
in
the
man
who
had
been
so
much
to
him
yet
his
first
words
seemed
to
express
more
of
passionate
resentment
than
any
he
had
yet
spoken
you
acted
wrongly
he
exclaimed
in
a
firm
clear
voice
were
wrong
in
allowing
her
to
stay
and
help
you
in
the
library
you
were
wrong
in
speaking
to
her
as
you
did
in
asking
her
to
address
you
as
an
equal
and
to
let
you
be
her
friend
you
must
have
known
then
what
your
real
meaning
was
it
is
only
half
a
truth
that
you
said
and
did
nothing
to
disturb
her
mind
you
were
not
honest
with
yourself
and
you
had
no
just
regard
for
me
you
yield
to
temptation
and
all
you
have
said
in
defence
of
yourself
has
only
been
true
in
sound
you
go
too
far
grail
you
accused
me
of
baseness
and
i
have
never
had
a
base
thought
then
came
a
long
silence
gilbert
stood
motionless
egremont
walked
slowly
from
place
to
place
the
point
at
issue
between
the
two
men
was
changed
anger
and
suspicion
were
at
an
end
but
so
was
all
hope
of
restoring
the
old
union
then
egremont
said
must
tell
me
one
thing
plainly
do
you
still
doubt
my
word
when
i
say
that
i
knew
nothing
of
her
flight
from
you
and
know
nothing
of
where
she
now
is
believe
you
was
answered
simply
more
than
that
do
you
think
me
capable
of
wronging
her
and
you
in
the
way
you
suspected
was
wrong
i
was
unjust
to
you
grail
could
suffer
jealousy
but
was
incapable
of
malice
the
stab
of
the
revelation
that
had
been
made
might
go
through
and
through
his
heart
but
the
wound
would
breed
no
evil
humours
he
made
his
admission
with
the
relief
which
comes
of
recovered
you
for
that
grail
walter
replied
moved
as
a
gentle
nature
always
is
by
magnanimity
after
another
pause
he
said
i
ask
you
anything
more
about
her
had
she
money
could
she
have
gone
far
most
she
had
a
few
pence
she
leave
no
written
word
she
wrote
something
for
her
sister
walter
hesitated
grail
after
a
struggle
with
himself
repeated
the
substance
of
thyrza
note
a
few
more
words
were
interchanged
then
gilbert
said
will
leave
you
now
mr
egremont
walter
dreaded
this
parting
could
he
let
grail
go
from
him
and
say
no
word
about
the
library
yet
what
was
to
be
said
everything
was
hopelessly
at
an
end
the
hint
of
favour
from
him
to
the
other
was
henceforth
insult
gilbert
was
moving
towards
him
but
he
could
not
look
up
forcing
himself
to
speak
you
find
her
if
you
hear
anything
will
you
tell
me
i
mean
only
will
you
let
me
know
the
fact
that
you
have
news
i
will
at
length
their
eyes
met
then
grail
held
out
his
hand
and
egremont
clasped
it
firmly
is
not
the
end
between
us
he
said
huskily
must
wish
that
you
had
never
seen
me
but
i
can
never
lose
the
hope
that
we
may
some
day
be
friends
again
the
haggard
man
went
his
way
in
silence
egremont
throwing
himself
upon
a
seat
in
utter
weariness
felt
more
alone
than
ever
yet
in
his
life
who
or
what
was
left
to
him
now
a
little
while
ago
when
he
had
felt
that
his
connection
with
the
world
of
wealth
and
refinement
was
practically
at
an
end
it
seemed
more
than
a
substitute
to
look
forward
to
intimacy
with
that
one
household
in
lambeth
and
to
associations
that
would
arise
thence
he
believed
that
it
would
henceforth
content
him
to
have
friends
in
the
sphere
to
which
he
belonged
by
birth
and
for
the
needs
of
his
mind
to
find
companionship
among
his
books
he
saw
before
him
a
career
of
practical
usefulness
such
as
only
a
man
in
his
peculiar
position
could
pursue
with
unwavering
zeal
what
now
was
to
become
of
his
future
where
were
his
friends
grail
had
said
that
in
lambeth
people
were
gossiping
evil
of
him
such
gossip
he
understood
too
well
would
have
its
lasting
effect
no
contradiction
could
avail
against
it
even
if
thyrza
returned
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
resume
her
life
in
the
old
places
the
truth
could
never
be
so
spread
as
to
counteract
the
harm
already
done
lambeth
had
lost
its
free
library
how
long
would
it
wait
before
another
man
was
found
able
and
willing
to
do
so
much
on
its
behalf
looking
in
the
other
direction
he
could
now
explain
that
scene
at
charing
cross
dalmaine
through
his
connection
with
lambeth
had
already
heard
the
story
he
took
this
way
of
showing
that
he
was
informed
of
everything
and
of
manifesting
his
august
disapproval
it
needed
only
a
word
of
admonition
to
paula
and
she
at
once
recognised
how
improper
it
would
be
to
hold
further
relations
with
so
unprincipled
a
man
so
they
turned
away
and
in
the
vulgar
phrase
him
the
dalmaines
knowing
of
course
their
relatives
and
their
friends
knew
the
tyrrells
would
by
this
time
have
discussed
the
whole
shocking
affair
doubtless
with
the
decision
that
they
could
no
longer
be
home
to
egremont
and
if
the
tyrrells
then
annabel
newthorpe
would
annabel
give
faith
to
such
a
charge
against
him
perhaps
such
evidence
would
be
adduced
to
her
that
she
could
have
no
choice
but
to
judge
and
condemn
him
gilbert
grail
had
thought
him
infamous
perhaps
annabel
would
hesitate
as
little
she
would
have
remarked
a
strangeness
in
his
manner
to
her
explicable
now
believing
how
she
must
scorn
him
how
those
beautiful
eyes
of
hers
would
speak
in
one
glance
of
cold
contempt
if
ever
he
passed
beneath
them
she
take
the
nobler
part
she
hold
it
incredible
till
she
had
a
confession
from
his
very
lips
but
were
women
magnanimous
and
annabel
very
clear
in
thought
very
pure
in
soul
was
she
after
all
so
far
above
her
sisters
as
to
face
all
hazard
of
human
weakness
in
defence
of
an
ideal
annabel
now
in
london
would
write
the
news
to
ormonde
would
it
receive
credence
from
her
his
dearest
friend
assuredly
not
if
she
had
known
nothing
to
give
the
calumny
startling
support
but
there
was
that
letter
he
wrote
to
her
about
thyrza
there
was
her
recollection
of
the
interview
in
great
russell
street
when
it
might
be
that
he
had
betrayed
himself
she
had
found
him
in
a
state
of
perturbation
which
he
could
not
conceal
it
was
on
the
eve
of
his
own
departure
from
london
of
thyrza
disappearance
well
she
too
must
form
her
own
judgment
if
she
wrote
to
him
and
asked
plainly
for
information
he
would
know
how
to
reply
till
she
wrote
he
must
keep
silence
so
there
was
the
of
his
friends
no
he
had
omitted
father
newthorpe
was
a
student
and
apt
to
be
humorously
cynical
in
his
judgment
of
men
to
him
the
story
would
not
appear
incredible
youth
human
nature
a
passionate
temperament
these
explain
so
much
to
the
unprejudiced
mind
newthorpe
must
go
with
the
rest
for
other
acquaintances
he
cared
nothing
so
his
fate
at
last
had
declared
itself
even
though
the
all
but
impossible
should
befall
and
grail
should
still
marry
thyrza
how
could
the
schemes
for
common
activity
survive
this
shock
say
what
he
might
he
had
no
longer
even
the
desire
to
work
personally
for
the
old
aims
how
hard
to
believe
that
he
was
the
same
man
who
had
lectured
to
that
little
band
of
hearers
on
english
literature
who
had
uttered
with
such
vehemence
the
for
the
present
that
period
of
his
life
was
gone
by
like
smoke
the
heart
in
which
such
enthusiasms
were
nourished
had
been
swept
by
an
fire
henceforth
he
must
live
for
himself
the
vainest
of
all
lives
to
such
a
one
the
world
was
a
sorry
place
he
had
no
mind
to
taste
such
pleasures
as
it
offered
to
a
rich
man
with
no
ideal
save
physical
enjoyment
he
no
longer
cared
to
search
out
its
beautiful
things
to
probe
its
mysteries
to
what
end
since
all
pleasure
and
all
knowledge
must
end
in
himself
where
at
this
moment
was
thyrza
the
thought
had
mingled
with
all
those
others
did
she
then
love
him
so
much
that
marriage
with
grail
had
become
impossible
that
she
would
rather
face
every
hardship
and
peril
of
a
hidden
life
in
some
dark
corner
of
london
for
she
lived
proof
of
it
seemed
to
be
in
the
refusal
of
his
mind
to
contemplate
a
fatal
issue
of
her
trial
she
lived
and
held
him
in
her
heart
the
strong
passionate
heart
source
of
music
and
of
love
and
he
could
he
foresee
the
day
when
he
should
no
longer
love
her
but
of
that
she
knew
nothing
and
must
never
know
of
it
the
one
outlook
for
his
life
lay
yonder
where
love
was
beckoning
grant
him
leave
to
follow
and
what
limitless
prospect
opened
in
place
of
the
barren
hills
which
now
enclosed
him
but
follow
he
must
not
in
that
respect
nothing
was
altered
when
he
thought
of
thyrza
it
must
still
be
with
the
hope
that
she
would
return
and
fulfil
her
promise
to
gilbert
grail
at
a
late
hour
he
went
to
his
bedroom
he
lay
down
with
a
weary
brain
and
in
trying
to
ask
himself
what
he
should
do
on
the
morrow
fell
asleep
chapter
xxvii
found
ormonde
waited
anxiously
for
annabel
first
letter
from
london
neither
of
them
had
spoken
of
egremont
after
annabel
visit
with
the
news
from
paula
the
girl
gave
no
sign
of
trouble
she
appeared
to
continue
her
preparations
with
the
same
enjoyment
as
before
it
was
doubtful
whether
in
writing
she
would
make
any
reference
to
egremont
but
ormonde
hoped
there
would
be
some
word
the
letter
came
five
days
after
annabel
arrival
in
london
and
was
short
it
mentioned
visits
to
the
academy
and
the
grosvenor
made
a
few
comments
spoke
of
this
and
that
old
acquaintance
reseen
then
came
a
concluding
paragraph
called
at
egremont
two
days
ago
but
did
not
see
him
he
learnt
that
egremont
had
been
at
home
for
one
day
but
was
gone
out
of
town
again
my
aunt
as
i
gather
from
a
chance
word
takes
the
least
charitable
view
i
fear
that
was
to
be
expected
we
however
the
truth
do
we
not
it
is
sad
but
not
shameful
i
have
no
means
of
hearing
anything
about
the
library
i
believe
father
has
been
to
lambeth
but
he
and
i
do
not
speak
on
the
subject
paula
for
some
reason
avoids
me
it
was
one
of
several
letters
that
arrived
that
morning
after
opening
two
appeals
from
charitable
institutions
ormonde
found
an
envelope
which
from
the
handwriting
upon
it
she
judged
to
be
a
similar
communication
from
a
private
source
the
address
was
laboriously
scrawled
and
the
postage
stamp
was
badly
affixed
there
were
on
the
back
such
envelopes
generally
came
from
the
parents
of
children
who
had
been
in
the
home
and
frequently
dirtiness
announced
such
cases
made
appeal
for
temporary
assistance
the
present
missive
however
was
misleading
its
contents
proved
to
be
these
we
have
a
young
girl
with
us
as
lies
very
bad
she
come
to
us
not
more
than
three
week
ago
and
asked
for
ployment
and
me
and
my
husband
was
unwilling
for
to
give
her
a
chance
seeing
she
looked
respectable
though
we
thought
it
was
unlikely
as
there
might
be
something
wrong
because
of
her
looks
and
her
clothing
which
neither
of
them
like
the
girl
out
of
work
and
then
it
true
she
could
give
no
reference
and
now
she
had
fainting
fits
and
lies
very
bad
having
broke
two
dishes
with
falling
and
which
of
course
she
could
help
and
we
do
say
as
she
could
my
husband
told
me
as
i
ought
for
to
look
in
her
pocket
and
which
i
did
and
there
i
found
a
envelope
as
had
wrote
your
name
and
address
on
it
so
i
take
the
liberty
of
writing
and
which
i
am
not
much
of
a
scholar
because
she
do
lie
very
bad
and
if
so
be
she
has
friends
they
had
ought
to
know
i
do
what
i
can
for
her
but
i
have
the
customers
to
tend
to
because
we
keep
a
which
you
find
it
at
number
seventeen
bank
street
off
the
caledonian
road
and
i
beg
to
end
from
yours
obedient
sarah
gandle
there
could
be
little
doubt
who
this
young
girl
was
bad
spelling
and
worse
writing
rendered
the
letter
difficult
to
translate
into
english
but
from
the
first
sentence
ormonde
thought
of
thyrza
trent
the
description
would
apply
to
thyrza
and
thyrza
might
by
some
chance
have
kept
in
her
pocket
the
address
which
as
ormonde
knew
bunce
had
given
her
when
she
brought
bessie
to
eastbourne
her
first
emotion
was
of
joy
this
was
quickly
succeeded
by
doubts
and
fears
in
plenty
for
it
was
difficult
to
explain
thyrza
taking
such
a
step
as
this
letter
suggested
but
the
course
to
be
pursued
was
clear
she
took
the
first
train
to
london
caledonian
road
is
a
great
channel
of
traffic
running
directly
north
from
king
cross
to
holloway
it
is
doubtful
whether
london
can
show
any
thoroughfare
of
importance
more
offensive
to
eye
and
ear
and
nostril
you
stand
at
the
entrance
to

gaze
into
a
region
of
supreme
ugliness
every
house
front
is
marked
with
meanness
and
inveterate
grime
every
shop
seems
breaking
forth
with

the
people
who
walk
here
appear
one
and
all
to
be
employed
in
labour

unconscious

its
inexpugnable
home

with

you
see
the

occupied

undisguised
all
this

the

ormonde
drove
from
victoria
station
the
neighbourhood
was
unknown
to
her
save
by
name
on
entering
the
caledonian
road
her
cabman
had
to
make
inquiries
for
bank
street
which
he
at
length
found
not
far
from
the
prison
he
drew
up
before
a
small
on
the
window
whereof
was
pasted
this
advertisement
here
best
quality
largest
quantity
lowest
price
over
the
door
was
the
name
ormonde
bade
the
driver
wait
and
entered
it
was
the
of
this
part
of
the
world
every
available
place
was
occupied
by
men
some
in
their
who
were
doing
ample
justice
to
the
fare
set
before
them
by
gandle
and
her
daughter
beyond
the
space
assigned
to
the
public
was
a
partition
of
wood
four
feet
high
with
a
door
in
the
middle
this
concealed
the
kitchen
whence
came
clouds
of
steam
and
the
sound
of
frying
and
odours
manifold
at
the
entrance
of
a
lady
a
lady
without
qualification
such
of
the
feeders
as
happened
to
look
from
their
plates
stared
in
wonderment
it
was
an
embarrassing
position
ormonde
walked
quickly
down
the
narrow
gangway
and
to
the
door
in
the
partition
a
young
woman
was
just
coming
forth
with
steaming
plates
on
a
tray
i
see
mrs
gandle
the
visitor
asked
the
girl
cried
out
you
wanted
and
pushed
past
with
grins
bestowed
on
either
side
above
the
partition
appeared
a
face
like
a
harvest
moon
have
come
in
reply
to
your
letter
ormonde
said
letter
about
the
girl
who
is
you
come
have
you
mum
was
the
reply
in
a
voice
at
once
respectful
and
surprised
you
be
so
good
as
step
inside
mum
please
push
the
door
ormonde
was
relieved
to
pass
into
the
privacy
of
the
kitchen
it
was
a
room
of
some
ten
feet
square
insufferably
hot
very
dirty
a
factory
for
the
production
of
human
fodder
on
a
side
table
stood
a
great
red
dripping
mass
whence
gandle
severed
portions
to
be
supplied
as
roast
beef
vessels
on
the
range
held
a
green
substance
which
was
called
cabbage
and
yellow
lumps
doled
forth
as
potatoes
before
the
fire
bacon
and
sausages
were
frizzling
above
it
was
spluttering
a
on
a
sink
in
one
corner
were
piled
eating
utensils
which
awaited
the
wipe
of
a
very
loathsome
rag
hanging
hard
by
other
objects
lay
about
in
indescribable
confusion
gandle
was
a
very
stout
woman
with
bare
arms
she
perspired
freely
and
was
not
a
little
disconcerted
by
the
appearance
of
her
visitor
her
had
a
simple
and
not
disagreeable
look
wo
mind
me
on
with
my
work
the
whiles
i
talk
mum
she
said
men
tied
to
time
most
of
em
and
i
often
lost
a
customer
by
keepin
him
waitin
they
not
too
in
these
parts
i
was
born
and
bred
in
peckham
myself
and
only

a
shrill
voice

from
the
shop

gandle
and
proceeded
to
execute
the
orders

this
poor
girl

mum
she
calls
herself
mary
wood
do

one
o
that
name

screamed
the
woman
of
a
sudden
at
the
top
of
her
voice
stand
there
two
beefs
and
greens
right
mrs
gandle
roared
some
man
give
it
her
the
usial
with
her
an
sandy
dick
there
was
laughter
and
came
running
for
her
orders
gandle
with
endless
interruptions
proceeded
thus
you
and
me
mum
i
do
believe
as
that
is
her
name
but
she
give
it
at
first
and
she
stuck
to
it
no
i
do
think
she
worse
though
she
talked
a
lot
in
the
night
yes
we
had
a
doctor
she
would
have
me
send
for
nobody
and
said
as
there
was
nothing
ailed
her
but
then
it
come
as
she
could
stand
on
her
feet
she
a
littlish
girl
may
be
seventeen
or
eighteen
with
hair
i
have
knowed
well
what
to
do
i
thought
i
ought
to
send
her
to
the
but
then
i
found
the
henvelope
in
her
pocket
an
we
thought
we
just
wait
a
day
to
see
if
anybody
answered
us
and
i
did
like
to
act
heartless
with
her
neither
she
a
motherless
thing
so
she
says
an
only
wants
for
to
earn
her
keep
and
her
sleep
an
i
think
there
no
harm
in
her
as
i
can
see
she
come
into
the
shop
last
night
was
three
weeks
just
after
eleven
and
she
says
you
please
mum
she
says
speakin
very
nice
you
give
me
a
bed
for
sevenpence
i
do
know
about
that
says
i
have
a
bedroom
as
i
let
usial
under
a
shilling
then
she
was
for
goin
straight
away
without
another
word
and
she
was
so
quiet
like
it
took
me
as
i
could
send
her
off
without
asking
her
something
about
herself
and
she
said
she
had
got
no
in
london
and
only
sevenpence
in
her
pocket
and
as
how
she
wanted
to
find
work
and
she
must
have
walked
about
a
deal
she
looked
that
dead
beat
i
just
went
in
and
spoke
a
word
to
gandle
it
true
as
we
wanted
someone
to
help
me
we
wanted
someone
bad
for
a
long
time
and
this
young
girl
would
be
amiss
we
thought
for
waitin
in
the
shop
the
men
likes
to
see
a
noo
face
you
know
mum
an
all
the
more
if
it
a
if
she
been
a
lookin
girl
of
course
i
could
have
not
so
much
as
thought
of
it
as
things
was
she
told
me
plain
an
straightforward
as
she
say
who
she
was
and
where
she
come
from
and
it
was
something
in
her
way
o
speakin
a
kind
o
quietness
like
as
you
do
hoften
get
in
young
girls
nowadays
they
so
as
their
parents
ai
got
the
same
on
as
they
had
when
i
was
young
i
should
wonder
if
you
noticed
the
same
thing
with
your
servants
mum
an
so
i
said
as
i
let
her
have
a
bed
for
sevenpence
and
if
you
a
seen
how
thankful
she
looked
she
was
the
kind
to
go
an
sleep
anywhere
goodness
only
knows
what
might
a
come
to
her
at
that
hour
o
the
night
and
the
next
mornin
she
did
look
that
white
an
poorly
when
i
met
her
down
the
stairs
says
i
what
about
breakfast
eh
she
went
a
bit
red
like
an
said
as
it
did
matter
she
go
out
an
find
work
look
here
now
says
i
you
wash
up
them
things
there
to
pay
for
a
cup
o
tea
and
two
slices
then
she
looked
at
me
thankful
again
an
says
as
it
was
kind
o
me
well
of
course
you
may
say
as
it
is
everybody
a
took
her
in
for
sevenpence
but
then
as
i
was
we
did
want
somebody
to
help
me
an
an
i
do
take
much
to
myself
for
what
i
did

well
and
kindly
gandle
said
ormonde
so
the
long
story
went
on
the
girl
had
been
only
too
glad
to
stay
as
general
servant
and
worked
well
worked
as
hard
as
any
one
could
expect
gandle
said
but
she
was
far
from
well
and
every
day
after
the
first
week
her
strength
fell
off
at
length
she
had
a
fainting
fit
falling
with
two
dishes
in
her
hands
her
work
had
to
be
lightened
but
the
fainting
was
several
times
repeated
and
now
three
days
ago
illness
it
was
impossible
to
struggle
against
kept
her
to
her
bed
i
begged
an
i
prayed
of
her
as
she
tell
me
where
she
belonged
and
where
her
friends
was
but
she
could
only
cry
an
say
as
she
go
away
and
would
be
a
burden
talk
silly
child
i
kep
sayin
can
you
go
away
in
this
state
unless
you
goin
to
your
friends
but
she
said
no
as
she
had
no
friends
to
go
to
she
cried
so
it
fair
went
to
my
heart
the
poor
thing
an
i
begun
to
be
that
afraid
as
she
die
i
am
that
glad
as
you
come
mum
if
you
do
mind
waitin
another
ten
minutes
the
worst
o
this
be
over
an
then
i
can

it
and
go
upstairs

conscious
at
present

a
little
while
ago
it
is
the
nights

worst
of
course

an
talked

to
see
she
has
some
trouble
on
her
mind
i
have
got
nobody
as
can
sit
with
her
when
we
have
the
shop
full
but
i
was
with
her
up
to
three
this
morning
then
took
my
place
till
the
shop
was
opened
for
the
early
corfee
i
do
think
she
no
worse
and
the
doctor
he
do
think
so
he
a
clever
man
i
believe
at
all
events
he
has
that
name
as
i
may
say
and
he
lives
just
round
here
in
winter
street
a
house
with
railing
and
wrote
up
on
the
window

suppose
as
he
but
he
sure
to
be
at
in
an
hour
and
if

just
send
round
you
i
think
i
go
and
see
him
at
last
the
burden
of
the
was
over
and
could
be
left
alone
for
a
little
gandle
washed
her
hands
in
a
perfunctory
way
and
guided
her
visitor
to
a
dark
flight
of
stairs
they
ascended
on
the
top
floor
the
woman
stopped
and
whispered
the
room
should
i
just
look
in
first
mum
gandle
entered
and
came
forth
again
seems
to
me
to
be
asleep
mum
she
lays
very
still
and
her
eyes
is
shut
go
in
i
shall
sit
with
her
for
an
hour
and
then
go
to
see
the
doctor
ormonde
passed
in
it
was
a
mean
little
room
not
as
tidy
as
it
might
have
been
and
far
from
as
clean
there
on
the
low
pillow
was
a
pale
face
with
golden
hair
disordered
about
the
brow
a
face
so
wasted
that
it
was
not
easy
in
the
first
moment
to
identify
it
with
that
which
had
been
so
wonderful
in
its
beauty
by
the
but
it
was
thyrza
her
eyes
were
only
half
closed
and
it
was
not
a
natural
sleep
that
held
her
ormonde
examined
her
for
several
moments
then
just
touched
her
forehead
thyrza
stirred
and
muttered
something
but
gave
no
sign
of
consciousness
the
hour
went
by
very
slowly
the
traffic
in
the
street
was
incessant
and
noisy
two
men
who
were
selling
coals
from
a
cart
for
a
long
time
vied
with
each
other
in
the
utterance
of
roars
drawn
out
in
afflicting
cadence
ormonde
now
sat
by
the
bed
regarding
thyrza
now
went
to
the
window
and
looked
at
the
grimy
houses
opposite
the
prescribed
interval
had
almost
elapsed
when
thyrza
suddenly
raised
herself
and
said
with
distinctness
promised
me
lyddy
you
know
you
promised
ormonde
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
she
drew
nearer
and
as
the
sick
girl
regarded
her
asked
you
know
me
thyrza
thyrza
fell
back
she
spoke
a
few
disconnected
words
then
her
eyes
again
and
the
lethargy
returned
upon
her
in
a
few
minutes
ormonde
left
the
room
and
sought
her
acquaintance
in
the
cooking
department
gandle
gave
her
the
exact
address
of
the
medical
man
and
she
found
the
house
without
difficulty
she
had
to
wait
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
a
bare
dusty
where
also
sat
a
woman
who
coughed
without
ceasing
and
a
boy
who
had
a
formidable
bandage
athwart
his
face
the
practitioner
when
he
presented
himself
failed
to
inspire
her
with
confidence
he
expressed
himself
so
ambiguously
about
condition
and
gave
on
the
whole
such
scanty
proof
of
intelligence
that
ormonde
felt
it
unsafe
to
leave
him
in
charge
of
a
case
such
as
this
she
easily
obtained
his
permission
to
summon
a
doctor
with
whom
she
was
acquainted
she
drove
to
the
latter
abode
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
him
at
luncheon
she
was
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
the
family
and
accepted
very
willingly
an
invitation
to
join
them
at
their
meal
but
the
doctor
could
not
get
to
caledonian
road
before
the
evening
having
made
an
appointment
with
him
for
seven
she
next
drove
to
the
east
side
of
regent
park
where
in
a
street
of
small
houses
she
knocked
at
a
door
and
made
inquiries
for
emerson
this
lady
was
at
home
the
servant
said
ormonde
went
up
the
first
floor
and
entered
a
its
one
occupant
was
a
young
woman
probably
of
who
sat
in
attire
her
look
suggested
that
she
had
come
home
too
weary
even
to
take
her
bonnet
off
before
resting
she
had
the
air
of
an
educated
person
her
dress
which
was
plain
and
decent
in
the
same
rather
depressing
way
as
the
appointment
of
her
room
put
it
beyond
doubt
that
she
spent
her
days
in
some
one
of
the
manifold
kinds
of
teaching
a
roll
upon
her
lap
plainly
consisted
of
music
she
could
not
lay
claim
to
good
looks
save
in
the
sense
that
her
features
were
impressed
with
agreeable
womanliness
the
smile
which
followed
speedily
upon
her
expression
of
surprise
when
ormonde
appeared
was
natural
homely
and
sweet
she
threw
the
roll
away
and
sprang
up
with
a
joyous
exclamation
think
that
you
should
come
just
on
this
day
and
at
this
time
ormonde
it
just
by
chance
that
i
at
home
i
only
this
moment
come
back
from
notting
hill
where
i
found
a
pupil
too
unwell
to
have
her
lesson
and
in
half
an
hour
i
have
to
go
to
john
wood
just
by
a
chance
that
i
here
how
vexed
i
should
have
been
if
i
heard
of
you
coming
whilst
i
was
away
it
annoying
for
people
to
call
whilst
one
away
i
mean
of
course
people
one
really
wants
to
see
things
do
often
happen
so
well
i
in
town
on
very
doleful
business
and
have
come
to
see
if
you
can
help
me
you
how
i
do
hope
i
can
you
still
your
spare
room
yes
i
may
perhaps
ask
you
to
let
me
have
it
in
a
few
days
i
must
tell
you
how
it
is
a
poor
girl
in
whom
i
have
a
great
interest
has
fallen
ill
in
very
dreary
lodgings
i
do
think
it
would
be
possible
to
move
her
at
present
i
do
in
fact
yet
know
the
nature
of
her
illness
exactly
and
of
course
if
it
anything
to
be
afraid
of
i
should
bring
her
but
that
is
scarcely
likely
i
fancy
she
will
want
only
careful
nursing
lambe
is
going
to
see
her
this
evening
and
he
just
promised
me
to
send
a
nurse
from
some
institution
where
he
has
to
call
if
we
can
safely
move
her
presently
may
i
bring
her
here
course
you
may
ormonde
i
get
everything
ready
to
night
will
you
come
up
and
tell
me
of
anything
you
like
me
to
do
now
you
look
tired
and
must
rest
before
you
go
out
again
come
and
see
you
again
let
me
see
i
shall
be
here
at
twelve
but
only
for
a
few
minutes
then
i
sha
be
home
again
till
nine
could
you
come
after
then
mrs
ormonde
but
what
a
long
day
that
is
i
hope
you
not
often
so
late
i
do
mind
it
a
bit
said
the
other
cheerfully
a
pupil
at
seven
oaks
piano
and
singing
indeed
i
very
glad
the
more
the
better
they
keep
me
out
of
mischief
ormonde
smiled
moderately
in
reply
to
the
laugh
with
which
emerson
completed
her
jest
is
your
husband
far
from
well
i
so
sorry
he
is
in
now
i
think
he
no
i
not
quite
sure
where
he
is
he
had
to
go
somewhere
on
business
is
able
to
get
to
business
again
ormonde
asked
without
looking
at
the
other
to
his
regular
business
oh
no
that
would
be
safe
yet
he
begins
to
look
better
but
he
very
weak
still
it
must
be
very
hard
for
a
man
of
his
age
to
be
compelled
to
guard
against
all
sorts
of
little
things
that
other
people
think
nothing
of
must
it
it
must
be
trying
ormonde
replied
quietly
emerson
was
a
young
gentleman
of
leisurely
habits
and
precarious
income
ormonde
suspected
and
with
reason
that
he
nurtured
a
feeble
constitution
at
the
expense
of
his
wife
labour
he
was
seldom
at
home
and
the
persons
interested
in
emerson
had
a
difficulty
in
making
his
nearer
acquaintance
i
ca
think
there
another
man
in
the
world
who
would
bear
it
so
uncomplainingly
but
you
know
she
added
laughing
again
very
proud
of
my
husband
i
always
make
you
smile
at
me
ormonde
but
now
i
am
so
very
very
sorry
but
i
obliged
to
go
i
manage
to
catch
a
just
at
the
top
of
the
street
if
i
missed
it
i
should
be
half
an
hour
late
and
these
are
very
particular
people
oh
i
such
a
laughable
story
to
tell
you
about
them
but
it
must
wait
till
harold
says
i
tell
it
so
well
he
sure
i
could
write
a
novel
if
i
tried
i
think
i
will
try
some
day
i
believe
people
make
a
great
deal
of
money
out
of
novels
do
they
mrs
ormonde
have
heard
of
one
or
two
who
tried
to
but
did
do
hope
the
poor
girl
will
soon
be
well
enough
to
come
i
get
the
room
thoroughly
in
order
they
left
the
house
together
emerson
ran
in
the
direction
of
the
omnibus
she
wished
to
catch
the
other
shortly
found
a
vehicle
and
drove
back
again
to
bank
street
caledonian
road
thyrza
still
lay
in
the
same
condition
in
a
little
more
than
half
an
hour
came
the
trained
nurse
of
lambe
sending
and
forthwith
the
was
got
into
a
more
tolerable
condition
ormonde
procuring
whatever
the
nurse
desired
much
private
talk
passed
downstairs
between
gandle
and
who
were
greatly
astonished
at
the
fuss
made
over
the
girl
they
had
supposed
friendless
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
said
the
good
woman
several
times
ai
often
as
you
lose
by
doin
a
bit
kindness
and
the
chance
always
is
as
it
be
paid
back
to
you
more
than
you
never
think
any
one
can
see
as
this
ormonde
a
real
lady
and
when
it
comes
to
settlin
up
you
see
if
she
does
know
how
to
behave
a
lady
ormonde
took
a
room
at
a
private
hotel
near
king
cross
whither
her
travelling
bag
was
brought
from
victoria
she
avoided
the
part
of
the
town
in
which
acquaintances
might
hear
of
her
for
her
business
had
to
be
kept
secret
a
necessary
letter
despatched
to
mapper
at
the
chestnuts
she
went
once
more
to
bank
street
and
met
her
friend
lambe
she
told
him
in
general
terms
all
she
knew
of
the
circumstances
which
might
have
led
to
thyrza
illness
at
first
she
had
been
in
doubt
whether
or
not
to
go
to
lambeth
and
see
lydia
trent
but
on
the
whole
it
seemed
better
to
take
no
steps
in
that
direction
for
the
present
should
the
case
be
declared
dangerous
lydia
of
course
must
be
sent
for
but
that
was
a
dark
possibility
from
which
her
thoughts
willingly
averted
themselves
the
sister
could
doubtless
throw
some
light
on
thyrza
strange
calamity
what
did
the
child
know
you
promised
me
mean
but
that
would
be
no
aid
to
the
physician
upon
whom
for
the
present
most
depended
nor
did
lambe
exhibit
much
curiosity
he
seemed
quickly
to
gather
all
it
was
really
necessary
for
him
to
know
and
though
he
admitted
that
the
disorder
was
likely
to
be
troublesome
he
gave
an
assurance
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
alarm
are
not
associated
in
her
mind
with
anything
distressing
he
asked
of
ormonde
believe
the
opposite
then
be
by
her
side
as
often
as
you
can
so
that
she
may
recognise
you
as
soon
as
possible
he
added
with
a
smile
inform
ormonde
how
to
behave
when
she
recognised
they
were
at
a
little
distance
from
the
bed
and
both
looked
at
the
unconscious
face
very
beautiful
girl
the
doctor
murmured
you
should
see
her
in
health
i
am
a
trifle
susceptible
well
well
we
shall
have
her
through
it
no
doubt
we
have
to
jest
a
little
in
the
presence
of
suffering
or
how
should
we
live
our
lives
the
recognition
came
late
on
the
following
afternoon
thyrza
had
lain
for
a
time
with
eyes
open
watching
the
movements
of
the
nurse
but
seemingly
with
no
desire
to
speak
then
ormonde
came
in
the
watchful
look
at
once
turned
upon
her
for
a
moment
that
former
fear
showed
itself
and
thyrza
made
an
effort
to
rise
from
the
pillow
her
strength
was
too
far
wasted
but
as
ormonde
drew
near
she
was
plainly
known
you
know
me
now
ormonde
was
whispered
still
with
look
of
alarm
and
troubled
inability
to
comprehend
have
been
ill
dear
and
i
have
come
to
sit
with
you
the
other
went
on
in
a
soothing
voice
i
stay
there
was
no
answer
for
a
little
then
thyrza
with
sudden
revival
of
memory
like
a
light
kindled
in
her
eyes
said
painfully
does
lyddy
know
yet
do
you
wish
her
to
do
tell
lyddy
i
shall
be
better
one
shall
know
thyrza
do
speak
now
i
am
going
to
sit
by
you
much
mental
disturbance
was
evident
on
the
pale
face
for
some
time
after
this
but
thyrza
did
not
speak
again
and
presently
she
appeared
to
sleep
ormonde
left
the
house
at
midnight
and
was
back
again
before
nine
the
next
morning
thyrza
had
been
perfectly
conscious
since
daybreak
and
had
several
times
asked
for
the
absent
friend
she
smiled
when
ormonde
came
at
length
and
kissed
her
forehead
this
morning
better
i
think
ormonde
but
i
ca
lift
my
arm
it
so
heavy
the
doctor
came
late
in
the
morning
he
was
agreeably
surprised
at
the
course
things
were
taking
but
thyrza
was
forbidden
to
speak
and
for
much
of
the
day
she
relapsed
into
an
apathetic
scarcely
conscious
state
ormonde
had
preferred
not
to
leave
her
the
evening
before
and
had
explained
by
telegram
her
failure
to
keep
her
appointment
with
emerson
she
visited
her
friends
by
regent
park
on
looking
in
at
the
before
going
to
her
hotel
for
the
night
she
found
the
patient
feverish
and
excited
has
been
asking
for
you
ever
since
you
went
away
whispered
the
nurse
thyrza
inquired
anxiously
as
if
the
thought
were
newly
come
to
her
did
you
know
where
i
was
mrs
ormonde
gandle
found
my
name
and
address
in
your
pocket
and
wrote
to
me
my
pocket
why
should
she
look
in
my
pocket
was
anxious
to
have
a
friend
come
to
you
thyrza
any
one
else
know
lyddy
does
nor
anybody
it
was
in
my
pocket
i
kept
it
from
that
time
when
i
went
to
to
oh
i
ca
remember
eastbourne
dear
eastbourne
the
only
way
of
quieting
her
was
for
ormonde
to
sit
holding
her
hand
it
was
nearly
dawn
when
the
fit
of
fever
was
allayed
and
sleep
came
a
week
passed
before
it
was
possible
to
think
of
removing
her
from
these
miserable
quarters
to
the
other
room
which
awaited
her
ormonde
presence
had
doubtless
been
a
great
aid
to
the
sufferer
in
her
struggle
with
intermittent
fever
and
mental
pain
as
thyrza
recovered
her
power
of
continuous
thought
she
showed
less
disposition
to
talk
the
trouble
which
still
hung
above
her
seemed
to
impose
silence
she
was
never
quite
still
save
when
ormonde
sat
by
her
but
at
those
times
she
generally
kept
her
face
averted
closing
her
eyes
if
either
of
her
nurses
seemed
to
watch
her
she
asked
no
questions
gandle
came
up
occasionally
and
to
her
thyrza
spoke
very
gently
and
gratefully
she
asked
to
see
and
that
damsel
made
an
elaborate
toilette
for
the
ceremony
of
introduction
to
the
transformed
sickroom
do
believe
as
she
a
workin
girl
at
all
remarked
mysteriously
to
her
mother
afterwards
ormind
daughter
as
has
runned
away
from
her
an
that
the
truth
of
it
be
silly
why
there
ai
no
more
likeness
than
in
that
there
cabbage
do
care
that
what
i
think
an
think
it
i
always
shall
choose
what
always
was
obstinit
i
was
an
it
good
as
some
people
is
it
would
do
for
us
all
to
think
the
same
way
it
spoil
our
appetites
one
day
of
the
week
ormonde
spent
at
eastbourne
during
her
absence
from
home
no
letter
had
come
from
egremont
she
expected
daily
to
hear
from
mapper
that
he
had
called
at
the
chestnuts
but
nothing
was
seen
of
him
she
preferred
to
keep
silence
though
her
anxiety
was
constant
out
of
the
disparaging
rumours
which
had
found
ready
credence
in
the
circle
of
the
tyrrells
and
the
facts
which
she
had
under
her
own
eyes
it
was
not
difficult
for
her
to
construct
a
story
whereby
this
catastrophe
could
be
explained
without
attributing
anything
more
than
misfortune
to
either
egremont
or
thyrza
her
suppositions
came
very
near
to
the
truth
a
natural
inevitable
error
was
that
she
imagined
a
scene
of
mutual
declaration
between
the
two
she
could
only
conjecture
that
in
some
way
they
had
frequently
met
with
the
result
which
the
characters
of
both
being
understood
might
have
been
foreseen
possibly
egremont
had
thrown
aside
every
consideration
and
had
asked
thyrza
to
abandon
grail
for
his
sake
in
that
case
it
might
be
that
thyrza
had
fled
from
what
she
regarded
as
dishonourable
selfishness
unable
to
keep
her
promise
to
grail
alike
unable
to
find
her
own
happiness
at
his
expense
this
was
supposing
the
best
but
as
a
woman
who
knew
the
world
she
could
not
altogether
deny
approach
to
fears
which
in
speaking
with
annabel
she
would
not
glance
at
it
was
unlike
egremont
to
pass
through
a
crisis
such
as
this
without
having
recourse
to
her
sympathy
which
had
so
long
been
to
him
as
that
of
a
mother
perhaps
he
could
not
speak
to
her
in
any
case
the
immediate
future
was
full
of
difficulties
it
was
a
simple
matter
to
take
thyrza
to
the
emersons
lodgings
and
get
her
restored
to
health
but
what
must
then
become
of
her
the
best
hope
was
that
even
yet
she
might
marry
grail
between
the
latter
and
egremont
doubtless
everything
was
at
an
end
all
the
better
if
there
remained
a
possibility
of
thyrza
forgetting
this
trial
and
some
day
fulfilling
her
promise
but
in
the
meantime
a
period
perhaps
of
years
what
must
be
done
the
sisters
might
of
course
live
together
as
hitherto
and
earn
their
living
in
the
accustomed
way
but
ormonde
understood
too
well
the
dangers
of
an
attempt
to
patch
together
old
and
new
there
was
no
foreseeing
the
effect
of
her
sufferings
on
thyrza
character
in
spite
of
idealisms
suffering
more
often
does
harm
than
good
in
fact
she
must
become
acquainted
with
the
truth
of
the
case
before
she
could
reasonably
advise
or
help
it
had
seemed
wise
as
yet
to
keep
the
discovery
of
thyrza
a
secret
even
though
by
disclosing
it
she
might
have
alleviated
others
pain
when
lydia
should
at
length
be
told
perhaps
difficulties
would
in
one
way
or
another
be
lessened
ormonde
at
length
spoke
to
the
invalid
of
the
plan
for
removing
her
thyrza
made
no
reply
but
when
her
friend
went
on
to
speak
of
the
people
in
whose
care
she
would
be
averted
her
eyes
as
if
in
trouble
ormonde
was
silent
for
a
while
then
asked
you
like
your
sister
to
come
when
you
are
in
the
other
house
thyrza
shook
her
head
she
would
have
spoken
but
instead
sobbed
she
must
be
in
dreadful
trouble
thyrza
you
write
to
her
please
ormonde
do
tell
her
where
i
am
but
say
that
i
am
well
again
i
ca
see
her
yet
not
till
i
have
begun
to
work
again
do
you
think
i
can
soon
go
and
find
work
you
wish
then
to
live
by
yourself
ormonde
asked
hoping
that
the
conversation
might
lead
thyrza
to
reveal
her
story
i
must
live
by
myself
i
must
see
any
one
for
a
long
time
i
can
earn
as
much
as
i
need
if
i
ca
find
anything
else
gandle
will
let
me
stay
with
her
there
was
silence
then
she
turned
her
face
to
ormonde
and
with
drooping
eyelids
asked
in
a
low
voice
you
know
why
i
left
home
mrs
ormonde
i
do
thyrza
the
other
replied
gently
have
not
seen
any
of
your
friends
i
think
very
likely
you
are
the
only
one
that
could
tell
me
the
truth
knows
was
spoken
presently
after
the
shedding
of
a
few
quiet
tears
left
a
letter
for
her
besides
she
knew
before
knew
that
the
voice
faltered
and
ceased
you
tell
me
what
it
was
thyrza
did
do
anything
wrong
ormonde
but
i
was
going
to
be
married
do
you
remember
about
mr
grail
dear
could
marry
him
i
did
love
him
she
turned
her
face
upon
the
pillow
ormonde
touched
her
with
kind
hand
and
when
she
saw
that
the
girl
could
tell
no
more
tried
to
soothe
her
understand
now
thyrza
i
know
it
must
have
been
a
great
trouble
that
drove
you
to
this
i
will
do
nothing
that
you
do
wish
but
we
must
let
lyddy
know
that
you
are
in
safety
suppose
you
write
a
letter
and
tell
her
that
you
have
been
ill
but
that
you
are
quite
well
again
and
with
friends
you
need
put
any
address
on
it
and
you
had
better
not
mention
my
name
it
will
be
enough
for
the
present
to
relieve
her
mind
i
do
that
ormonde
if
i
can
write
will
be
able
to
very
soon
it
would
frighten
lyddy
if
the
letter
came
to
her
written
in
a
strange
hand
ormonde
made
up
her
mind
not
to
let
it
be
known
that
she
was
in
communication
with
thyrza
much
was
still
dubious
but
clearly
it
would
be
the
wise
course
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
egremont
discovering
thyrza
place
of
abode
for
the
sake
of
the
long
future
a
little
more
must
be
borne
in
the
present
she
had
more
than
thyrza
interests
to
keep
in
mind
egremont
happiness
was
also
at
stake
and
that
after
all
was
the
first
concern
with
her
by
prudent
management
perhaps
the
lives
of
both
could
be
saved
from
this
seeming
wreck
and
sped
upon
their
several
ways
ways
surely
very
diverse
but
thyrza
was
troubled
with
desire
to
ask
something
when
tears
had
heightened
the
relief
of
having
told
as
much
as
she
might
she
asked
timidly
you
know
if
grail
has
gone
to
the
library
library
have
not
heard
could
he
go
after
this
happening
thyrza
she
replied
eagerly
would
go
just
the
same
why
he
it
would
prevent
that
just
because
i
did
marry
him
he
would
go
and
live
there
with
grail
his
mother
i
said
when
i
wrote
to
lyddy
that
he
go
to
the
library
just
the
same
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
mrs
ormonde
she
grew
so
agitated
that
ormonde
whilst
asking
herself
what
further
light
this
threw
on
the
matter
endeavoured
to
remove
her
trouble
no
doubt
he
has
gone
thyrza
we
shall
hear
all
about
it
very
soon
think
he
really
has
we
were
to
have
been
away
for
a
week
and
then
have
gone
to
live
at
the
library
have
you
heard
anything
from
whom
dear
from
egremont
he
was
beginning
to
put
the
books
on
the
shelves
i
was
told
about
that
it
was
all
ready
for
gilbert
to
go
and
begin
have
you
heard
about
it
mrs
ormonde
been
away
from
home
you
see
no
doubt
there
are
letters
for
me
shall
be
so
glad
when
i
know
ormonde
you
tell
me
when
you
heard
wo
you
please
i
been
thinking
about
it
a
long
time
before
i
was
ill
and
again
since
i
got
my
thoughts
back
i
want
to
be
sure
of
that
more
than
anything
i
sure
he
must
have
gone
egremont
was
going
away
somewhere
and
when
he
came
back
of
course
he
would
be
told
about
about
me
and
he
would
let
that
make
any
difference
to
gilbert
and
then
i
told
lyddy
in
the
letter
that
i
should
come
back
some
day
i
quite
sure
it
would
keep
him
from
going
to
the
library
ormonde
was
herself
very
desirous
of
knowing
what
turn
things
had
taken
in
lambeth
she
had
no
ready
means
of
inquiry
but
doubtless
newthorpe
would
have
intelligence
it
was
only
too
certain
that
the
affair
was
being
discussed
to
its
minutest
details
among
the
people
who
knew
egremont
she
determined
to
see
newthorpe
as
soon
as
thyrza
was
transported
to
the
house
by
regent
park
this
took
place
on
the
following
day
with
care
which
could
not
have
been
exceeded
had
the
invalid
been
a
person
as
important
and
precious
as
even
the
late
miss
paula
tyrrell
gandle
was
adequately
recompensed
her
conviction
that
ormonde
was
a
real
lady
suffered
no
shock
under
this
most
delicate
of
tests
ormonde
bade
farewell
to
bank
street
and
caledonian
road
with
a
great
hope
that
duty
or
necessity
might
never
lead
her
thither
again
thyrza
still
of
course
needed
the
nurse
attendance
and
accommodation
was
found
for
that
person
under
the
same
roof
when
the
party
arrived
at
emerson
was
at
home
by
appointment
she
assisted
in
carrying
the
invalid
upstairs
where
a
bright
warm
room
was
in
readiness
as
pleasant
a
change
after
the
garret
in
bank
street
as
any
one
could
have
desired
chapter
xxviii
hope
surprised
tyrrell
and
annabel
were
lunching
with
friends
somewhere
newthorpe
had
just
taken
a
solitary
meal
in
the
room
which
he
used
for
a
study
thither
ormonde
was
conducted
she
noticed
that
he
looked
by
no
means
so
well
as
he
had
done
before
leaving
eastbourne
his
greeting
was
nervous
he
would
not
sit
down
preferring
to
move
restlessly
from
one
position
to
another
was
about
to
write
to
you
he
said
news
do
you
bring
have
come
to
you
for
news
you
have
seen
egremont
seen
nor
heard
from
him
i
suppose
that
settles
the
matter
i
went
to
his
place
once
but
could
hear
nothing
of
him
and
since
then
i
have
just
waited
till
the
muddy
water
should
strain
itself
clear
again
i
am
in
ignorance
yet
of
the
state
of
things
in
lambeth
said
ormonde
you
know
anything
about
the
library
keeps
our
world
supplied
with
the
latest
information
newthorpe
replied
with
cold
sarcasm
library
scheme
i
suppose
is
at
an
end
the
man
grail
we
are
told
pursues
his
old
occupation
ormonde
kept
silence
the
other
continued
assuming
a
tone
of
cheerful
impartiality
it
is
very
instructive
an
affair
of
this
kind
one
knows
very
well
theoretically
how
average
humanity
fears
and
hates
a
nature
superior
to
itself
but
one
has
not
often
an
opportunity
of
seeing
it
so
well
illustrated
in
practice
tyrrell
attitude
has
especially
amused
me
his
lungs
begin
to
crow
like
chanticleer
as
often
as
the
story
comes
up
for
discussion
he
has
a
good
deal
of
personal
liking
for
egremont
but
to
see
idealist
in
the
mud
he
finds
altogether
too
delicious
his
wife
feels
exactly
in
the
same
way
though
she
expresses
her
feeling
differently
and
dalmaine
if
i
were
an
man
i
rather
think
i
should
have
kicked
dalmaine
downstairs
before
this
you
what
comes
of
lofty
priggishness
that
is
his
text
and
he
enlarges
on
it
in
a
manner
worthy
of
himself
and
the
amazing
thing
is
that
it
never
occurs
to
these
people
to
explain
what
has
happened
on
any
but
the
least
charitable
hypothesis
of
annabel
ormonde
asked
seems
to
have
no
interest
in
the
matter
so
far
so
good
perhaps
he
added
with
a
smile
is
revenging
herself
for
her
years
of
retirement
supposed
so
and
really
seems
to
be
enjoying
herself
i
do
see
much
of
her
she
came
in
the
other
night
to
tell
me
that
a
captain
somebody
had
proposed
to
her
after
six
minutes
of
acquaintance
and
laughed
more
gaily
over
it
than
i
ever
saw
her
it
part
of
her
education
of
course
probably
it
was
wise
to
postpone
it
no
longer
i
wait
with
curiosity
to
hear
her
opinion
of
this
world
at
the
end
of
july
ormonde
mused
newthorpe
walked
about
a
little
then
asked
do
you
prophesy
of
their
future
whose
future
and
his
wife
are
premature
he
is
not
married
then
you
are
not
altogether
without
news
shall
take
you
into
my
confidence
i
find
the
responsibility
a
little
too
burdensome
the
fact
is
this
girl
thyrza
trent
is
at
present
in
my
care
she
gave
a
succinct
account
of
the
recent
events
and
explained
them
as
far
as
her
information
allowed
the
point
still
remained
obscure
but
she
showed
her
reasons
for
believing
that
something
had
passed
between
egremont
and
thyrza
which
could
lead
to
but
one
result
if
they
met
again
now
that
the
old
objections
were
at
an
end
desire
is
she
pursued
prevent
that
meeting
i
have
racked
my
brains
over
the
matter
with
no
better
result
than
grundy
would
at
once
have
arrived
at
by
noble
intuition
it
would
be
a
grave
mistake
for
walter
to
marry
this
girl
general
grounds
or
from
your
special
knowledge
of
her
character
a
third
reason
is
that
i
have
long
ago
made
up
my
mind
whom
he
is
to
marry
said
newthorpe
gravely
the
worry
he
no
longer
cared
to
conceal
making
him
look
old
and
feeble
but
that
project
has
hardly
become
more
hopeful
during
the
last
few
weeks
have
to
think
of
a
lifetime
i
have
by
no
means
lost
hope
i
fear
the
atmosphere
in
which
you
are
living
has
some
effect
upon
you
the
case
stands
thus
walter
has
done
nothing
in
the
least
dishonourable
but
he
has
been
carried
away
as
any
imaginative
young
fellow
would
probably
have
been
under
the
circumstances
the
girl
is
very
beautiful
wonderfully
sweet
and
lovable
if
a
man
ruined
himself
to
obtain
her
i
dare
say
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
he
repented
least
six
months
i
ca
joke
about
thyrza
i
love
her
myself
and
if
i
can
by
any
means
guide
her
life
into
a
smooth
channel
it
will
make
me
very
happy
but
she
must
not
marry
walter
that
would
assuredly
be
for
her
happiness
the
prospect
before
her
was
ideal
too
good
of
course
to
be
realised
we
must
devise
some
other
future
for
her
think
of
taking
her
definitively
from
her
former
sphere
is
no
choice
she
ca
go
and
work
for
her
living
in
the
old
way
i
foresee
too
well
what
the
end
of
would
be
she
must
either
be
raised
or
fall
into
the
black
gulfs
so
beautifully
is
our
society
constructed
for
the
present
she
has
to
recover
her
health
the
doctor
tells
me
her
constitution
is
very
delicate
she
must
come
to
the
as
soon
as
she
is
well
enough
i
must
have
her
in
my
house
because
walter
may
come
any
day
but
it
will
have
to
be
eastbourne
i
fancy
as
i
do
know
how
to
make
plans
for
her
elsewhere
and
in
the
meantime
we
must
think
question
occurs
to
me
is
it
quite
certain
that
she
wo
of
her
own
motion
communicate
with
egremont
is
a
question
of
course
but
i
ca
do
more
than
take
all
reasonable
precautions
i
have
a
hope
though
that
before
long
she
will
confide
in
me
completely
the
poor
child
knows
nothing
of
this
scandal
she
even
believes
that
grail
will
take
the
librarianship
as
if
nothing
had
happened
i
ca
with
certainty
foresee
what
effect
it
will
have
upon
her
when
she
hears
the
truth
of
course
she
must
see
her
sister
before
very
long
in
the
meantime
i
have
to
tell
her
that
things
are
going
on
quite
smoothly
it
is
the
only
way
to
keep
her
calm
of
the
sister
is
she
a
person
to
be
trusted
do
know
her
but
from
the
way
in
which
thyrza
always
speaks
of
her
i
should
think
she
is
very
trustworthy
she
is
some
years
older
after
some
further
conversation
newthorpe
asked
is
egremont
doing
then
do
you
suppose
can
form
no
idea
you
write
to
him
think
not
the
poor
fellow
is
no
doubt
going
through
his
nay
as
he
used
to
say
a
few
years
ago
i
fear
it
has
come
in
earnest
this
time
he
will
come
to
me
when
i
can
really
be
of
use
to
him
if
i
see
him
just
now
i
shall
have
to
act
too
much
i
am
bad
at
that
i
better
try
to
find
him
if
you
like
and
see
what
answer
you
get
gloomy
business
for
that
poor
fellow
in
lambeth
it
hard
that
one
can
give
so
little
thought
to
him
if
i
speak
the
very
truth
i
still
have
a
secret
hope
that
she
may
marry
him
but
all
in
good
time
what
a
blessed
thing
time
is
it
makes
everything
easy
does
most
of
all
when
it
destroys
itself
he
said
it
with
a
sad
smile
ormonde
turned
again
to
the
subject
of
annabel
they
decided
that
it
was
better
to
say
nothing
to
her
as
yet
in
a
fortnight
thyrza
went
to
eastbourne
she
had
written
a
letter
to
lydia
a
few
days
after
her
establishment
with
emerson
a
letter
without
any
address
at
the
head
of
it
emerson
posted
it
in
a
remote
district
that
the
office
stamp
might
give
no
clue
ormonde
provided
her
with
lodgings
at
the
side
of
eastbourne
farthest
from
the
chestnuts
in
the
house
of
a
decent
woman
who
did
sewing
for
the
home
that
her
days
might
not
become
wearisome
for
lack
of
occupation
it
was
arranged
that
thyrza
should
give
her
landlady
occasional
help
with
the
needle
her
main
task
however
was
to
recover
health
and
strength
the
sea
air
helped
her
a
little
but
the
heaviness
of
her
heart
kept
her
frame
languid
at
first
she
could
walk
only
the
shortest
distances
as
soon
as
she
reached
the
sands
she
would
sit
down
wearily
and
fix
her
eyes
seawards
gazing
with
what
other
thoughts
than
when
that
horizon
met
her
vision
for
the
first
time
she
had
great
need
of
uttering
all
her
sorrow
but
could
not
do
so
to
ormonde
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
would
be
an
unpardonable
presumption
to
speak
of
egremont
as
she
thought
of
him
and
perhaps
she
could
not
have
brought
herself
to
tell
such
a
secret
whoever
had
been
involved
in
it
to
one
who
kind
as
she
was
remained
in
many
senses
a
stranger
to
lyddy
and
to
her
alone
she
could
have
poured
out
all
her
heart
the
longing
for
her
sister
was
now
ceaseless
she
grieved
that
she
had
left
london
without
seeing
her
in
the
night
she
sometimes
cried
for
hours
because
lyddy
was
so
far
from
her
ormonde
came
to
see
her
every
other
day
though
nothing
had
been
said
on
the
point
thyrza
understood
that
for
some
reason
she
was
not
expected
to
go
to
the
chestnuts
and
indeed
it
was
too
far
for
her
to
walk
in
her
present
weak
state
but
one
evening
she
was
drawn
in
that
direction
her
landlady
had
gone
to
hastings
and
would
be
absent
till
the
next
day
it
was
not
the
day
for
ormonde
visit
and
rain
since
morning
had
made
it
impossible
to
leave
the
house
the
hours
had
dragged
wearily
after
tea
the
clouds
broke
and
soon
there
were
warm
rays
from
the
westering
sun
thyrza
was
glad
to
leave
her
room
she
walked
into
the
main
street
of
the
town
for
her
solitude
was
become
a
pain
and
she
felt
a
desire
to
be
among
people
even
though
she
could
speak
to
no
one
she
came
to
the
road
which
as
she
well
remembered
led
to
house
it
tempted
her
on
she
would
like
to
look
at
the
house
a
friend
lived
there
and
her
heart
ached
to
be
near
someone
who
cared
for
her
the
prime
need
of
her
life
was
love
and
love
alone
could
restore
her
strength
and
give
her
courage
to
live
it
was
nearer
than
she
thought
though
troubled
by
the
consciousness
that
she
ought
not
to
have
come
so
far
in
this
direction
and
that
perhaps
her
strength
would
be
overtaxed
before
she
could
reach
home
again
she
went
still
on
and
on
until
reaching
the
point
where
another
road
joined
that
by
which
she
had
come
she
found
the
chestnuts
just
before
her
beyond
the
house
the
hill
rose
darkly
and
hid
the
setting
sun
as
she
stood
a
man
issued
from
the
adjoining
road
and
walked
straight
towards
the
entrance
of
the
garden
her
eyes
followed
him
and
though
for
a
moment
she
did
not
believe
their
evidence
they
told
her
that
egremont
had
passed
so
near
to
her
that
a
whisper
would
have
drawn
his
attention
she
was
in
the
shade
of
thick
trees
perhaps
that
circumstance
and
the
dark
colour
of
her
dress
accounted
for
his
not
observing
her
he
was
walking
quickly
too
and
was
looking
fixedly
at
the
house
she
followed
had
her
voice
been
at
her
command
in
that
instant
of
recognition
she
would
have
called
to
him
but
all
her
powers
seemed
to
desert
her
and
she
was
rather
borne
onwards
than
advanced
by
any
effort
of
her
own
he
had
passed
through
the
gate
when
she
reached
the
end
of
the
garden
wall
losing
him
from
sight
she
understood
what
she
was
doing
and
stayed
her
steps
a
sense
of
having
escaped
a
great
danger
made
her
tremble
so
that
she
feared
she
must
fall
to
the
ground
if
she
could
not
find
some
place
in
which
to
rest
a
few
steps
brought
her
into
a
piece
of
common
ground
which
lay
in
the
rear
of
the
garden
and
here
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
were
some
pieces
of
timber
the
severed
limbs
of
a
tree
that
had
fallen
in
the
past
winter
here
she
could
sit
leaning
against
the
brickwork
and
letting
her
heart
throb
itself
into
quietness
the
wall
was
a
low
one
and
above
it
in
this
place
rose
a
screen
of
trellis
overgrown
with
creepers
making
the
rear
of
a
spacious
which
ormonde
had
had
constructed
for
the
use
of
children
who
had
to
be
sheltered
from
too
much
either
of
sun
or
breeze
when
they
were
brought
out
of
doors
thyrza
had
not
been
resting
for
more
than
a
minute
or
two
when
a
voice
spoke
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
so
plainly
that
she
started
thinking
she
was
observed
and
addressed
the
voice
was
ormonde
at
last
she
said
have
come
there
was
a
brief
silence
then
the
tones
for
which
she
waited
once
more
fell
upon
her
ear
are
alone
asked
egremont
i
have
been
reading
and
thinking
shall
we
go
into
the
house
you
will
let
me
i
had
rather
sit
with
you
here
again
there
was
silence
when
ormonde
spoke
it
was
in
a
lower
voice
and
such
as
one
uses
in
reply
to
a
look
of
affection
have
you
kept
me
in
anxiety
about
you
for
so
long
walter
have
had
no
mind
to
speak
to
any
one
not
even
to
you
i
had
nothing
to
tell
you
that
would
please
you
to
hear
often
i
have
resolved
to
leave
england
for
good
and
give
no
account
of
myself
to
any
one
it
seemed
unkind
of
you
not
to
write
i
waited
till
i
knew
you
must
have
heard
all
that
people
had
to
say
of
me
and
then
every
day
i
expected
your
letter
you
could
only
be
silent
for
one
reason
then
have
you
come
now
i
am
ill
and
can
be
alone
no
longer
thyrza
scarcely
breathed
it
was
as
though
all
her
senses
had
merged
in
one
that
of
hearing
her
eyes
beheld
nothing
and
she
was
conscious
of
no
more
bodily
pain
she
listened
for
the
very
breathing
of
the
two
who
were
so
close
to
her
that
she
might
almost
have
touched
them
do
you
know
that
people
are
occupying
themselves
with
your
concerns
at
all
jersey
i
went
to
france
when
i
reached
london
again
knowing
nothing
of
what
had
happened
whilst
i
was
away
i
met
dalmaine
and
his
wife
at
charing
cross
station
they
turned
away
and
refused
to
speak
to
me
when
i
got
home
i
found
what
it
meant
grail
told
me
plainly
what
the
general
opinion
was
saw
grail
course
you
think
naturally
that
i
should
have
hidden
my
face
from
him
be
so
harsh
with
me
you
forget
that
i
have
still
to
learn
everything
i
will
tell
you
i
will
explain
i
will
defend
myself
i
want
your
sympathy
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
prove
that
i
am
not
contemptible
be
quiet
for
a
moment
i
have
not
written
to
you
because
i
thought
it
needless
to
make
conjectures
and
ask
questions
and
give
assurances
when
you
were
sure
sooner
or
later
to
come
and
tell
me
the
whole
story
i
wo
pretend
that
i
have
not
had
my
moments
of
uneasiness
for
instance
i
wrote
to
you
to
jersey
and
the
letter
was
returned
to
me
that
came
disagreeably
in
connection
with
news
i
just
then
had
from
london
it
was
only
human
to
suppose
that
for
some
reason
you
had
talked
of
going
to
jersey
and
then
had
not
gone
there
at
all
followed
me
there
and
failing
to
find
me
of
course
had
the
same
thought
yet
you
know
i
could
think
more
calmly
than
was
possible
for
him
now
tell
me
all
that
you
wish
what
had
happened
that
this
suspicion
fell
upon
you
thyrza
heard
a
complete
and
truthful
account
of
all
that
had
passed
between
herself
and
egremont
from
the
first
meeting
in
the
library
to
their
parting
near
lambeth
bridge
then
ormonde
asked
where
is
she
only
i
knew
she
has
written
to
her
sister
but
without
saying
where
she
is
only
that
she
has
been
ill
and
is
safe
with
people
who
are
kind
to
her
what
is
your
explanation
of
her
disappearance
believe
she
could
not
marry
grail
loving
another
man
the
silence
that
followed
seemed
very
long
to
the
listener
she
dreaded
lest
they
should
end
their
conversation
here
in
that
story
of
those
meetings
and
partings
as
told
by
egremont
there
had
now
and
then
been
a
word
a
tone
that
seemed
to
bear
meaning
yet
incredible
to
her
by
degrees
she
was
realising
all
that
her
flight
had
entailed
upon
those
she
left
things
undreamt
of
hitherto
but
the
last
word
of
explanation
was
still
to
come
she
did
not
dare
to
anticipate
it
yet
her
life
seemed
to
depend
upon
his
saying
something
more
you
made
efforts
to
find
her
ormonde
at
length
asked
possible
effort
what
purpose
i
tell
you
think
it
is
your
duty
to
offer
her
reparation
for
what
she
has
suffered
because
you
were
unwillingly
the
cause
of
it
if
that
is
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
i
love
her
and
that
i
wish
to
make
her
my
wife
a
sense
i
suppose
it
is
the
same
thing
you
have
been
compelled
to
think
so
much
of
her
that
pity
and
a
desire
to
do
your
best
for
an
unhappy
girl
have
come
to
seem
love
remember
that
by
your
own
admission
you
are
ill
you
can
not
judge
soundly
of
anything
even
of
your
own
feelings
you
have
done
a
good
deal
of
harm
walter
though
unintentionally
do
you
wish
to
do
yet
more
binding
yourself
for
life
to
a
poor
girl
who
can
never
by
any
possibility
be
a
fit
companion
for
you
i
have
seen
such
marriages
i
have
seen
the
beginning
of
them
and
the
end
you
least
of
all
men
should
fall
into
such
an
error
oh
yes
i
know
you
are
not
brutal
you
would
never
as
much
as
speak
an
unkind
word
no
but
you
would
do
what
in
this
case
would
be
worse
brutally
treated
thyrza
would
die
and
be
out
of
her
misery
with
you
she
would
drag
through
years
of
increasing
wretchedness
your
thwarted
life
would
be
her
long
torture
remember
how
often
i
have
told
you
that
you
have
much
that
is
feminine
in
your
character
you
have
little
real
energy
you
are
passive
in
great
trials
it
is
easier
to
you
to
suffer
than
to
act
your
idealism
is
often
noble
but
never
heroic
you
have
talked
to
me
of
your
natural
nearness
to
people
of
the
working
class
and
i
firmly
believe
that
you
are
further
from
them
for
any
such
purpose
as
this
in
question
than
many
a
man
who
counts
kindred
among
the
peerage
you
have
a
great
deal
of
spiritual
pride
and
it
will
increase
as
your
mind
matures
you
think
you
mature
tell
me
in
ten
years
if
i
am
alive
old
woman
that
i
am
how
you
look
back
on
your
present
self
walter
egremont
if
ever
you
ask
thyrza
to
marry
you
you
will
be
acting
with
cruel
selfishness
yes
selfishness
for
all
that
you
would
pay
bitterly
for
it
in
the
end
you
will
be
acting
in
a
way
utterly
unworthy
of
a
man
who
has
studied
and
reflected
thyrza
heard
egremont
laugh
hear
all
this
from
you
he
said
me
very
much
credit
me
with
so
little
power
of
mind
thought
you
were
the
last
to
talk
the
common
talk
of
the
world
that
has
outlived
its
generous
instincts
believe
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
outliving
youthful
passion
and
yet
retaining
all
the
generous
feeling
that
you
speak
of
i
am
not
an
ignoble
schemer
and
you
know
that
i
am
not
think
over
my
arguments
before
you
scorn
me
think
me
so
boyish
and
that
i
can
not
distinguish
between
pure
love
and
base
one
thing
i
left
out
of
my
narrative
just
now
i
ought
to
have
said
that
i
was
wholly
without
blame
in
that
intercourse
i
strove
with
myself
to
seem
nothing
more
than
friendly
to
her
and
yet
i
know
that
at
times
i
spoke
as
no
mere
friend
would
have
done
and
simply
because
i
could
not
help
it
i
loved
thyrza
even
then
with
more
intensity
of
pure
feeling
than
i
had
ever
before
known
and
now
i
love
her
with
a
love
which
lasts
a
lifetime
you
have
no
right
to
pronounce
so
confidently
upon
her
fitness
or
unfitness
to
mate
with
me
your
knowledge
of
her
is
very
slight
i
know
her
as
a
woman
can
only
be
known
by
the
man
who
loves
her
you
can
not
judge
for
me
in
this
case
no
one
could
judge
for
me
i
shall
act
on
my
conviction
it
is
poor
waste
of
life
to
do
otherwise
a
pause
whereof
the
seconds
were
to
one
ear
beaten
out
in
then
ormonde
said
very
quietly
have
told
grail
of
this
intention
has
never
occurred
to
you
that
the
great
wrongs
this
man
has
suffered
might
yet
be
repaired
perchance
if
you
were
willing
to
let
them
be
have
suffered
on
his
account
more
than
i
can
say
but
it
is
certain
that
he
and
thyrza
would
never
marry
after
this
see
no
such
certainty
it
merely
comes
to
this
that
he
and
i
love
the
same
woman
and
must
abide
by
her
decision
library
i
can
give
no
thought
to
it
for
i
am
suffering
a
greater
lose
be
human
be
honest
would
you
not
despise
me
if
loving
her
as
i
do
i
came
to
you
and
puled
about
the
overthrow
of
my
schemes
for
founding
a
public
library
let
it
go
let
the
people
rust
and
rot
in
ignorance
i
am
a
man
of
flesh
and
blood
and
the
one
woman
that
the
world
contains
is
lost
to
me
ormonde
seemed
to
think
long
over
this
passionate
outcry
egremont
broke
the
silence
more
be
human
she
writes
to
her
sister
that
she
has
been
ill
but
is
now
taken
care
of
by
friends
what
friends
you
are
not
ignorant
of
the
world
how
small
a
chance
it
is
that
she
has
fallen
among
people
who
will
protect
her
a
girl
with
her
beauty
and
so
simple
so
trustful
friends
indeed
i
am
all
but
frenzied
to
think
of
the
dangers
that
may
surround
her
she
is
more
to
me
than
my
life
blood
and
perhaps
even
now
she
is
in
terrible
need
of
some
honest
man
to
protect
her
and
you
can
talk
coldly
about
prudence
about
what
we
shall
think
and
say
years
hence
well
i
can
talk
no
more
morning
i
shall
go
back
to
london
and
go
on
searching
for
her
walking
about
the
streets
day
and
night
wearing
my
life
away
in
longing
for
her
i
have
done
with
the
past
and
all
those
i
used
to
call
my
friends
there
is
no
room
in
my
thought
for
anything
but
her
memory
and
the
desire
to
find
her
let
us
say
ormonde
if
i
am
wrong
and
selfish
as
you
say
then
it
is
beyond
my
power
to
conquer
the
faults
the
listener
heard
a
deep
sigh
then
sit
down
you
are
not
going
from
me
like
that
ca
stay
i
ca
talk
as
you
wish
to
i
am
so
utterably
miserable
and
i
came
to
you
because
i
had
always
known
you
gentle
and
sympathetic
would
never
be
anything
else
with
you
but
listen
have
you
entirely
forgotten
annabel
is
as
little
to
me
as
if
i
had
never
seen
her
you
can
not
say
that
i
have
any
obligation
to
her
i
asked
her
to
be
my
wife
and
she
refused
me
that
was
the
end
there
indeed
if
you
like
i
was
misled
i
admired
and
respected
her
and
made
myself
believe
that
it
was
love
again
and
again
i
doubted
myself
even
then
since
i
first
knew
that
i
loved
thyrza
i
have
never
doubted
one
moment
you
for
all
your
subtle
analysis
of
my
character
do
not
know
me
you
think
i
must
have
a
woman
of
fine
intellect
for
my
companion
you
are
wrong
what
i
need
i
have
seen
in
one
face
and
one
only
ormonde
spoke
in
a
changed
voice
one
point
i
can
set
your
mind
at
rest
and
i
will
for
i
can
not
bear
to
see
you
suffering
it
is
true
that
thyrza
is
with
friends
i
know
the
people
with
whom
she
is
living
know
them
you
know
where
thyrza
is
found
her
where
she
lay
ill
the
chance
of
her
having
my
address
in
her
possession
led
the
people
of
the
house
to
send
for
me
i
took
her
away
and
put
her
in
good
care
you
could
keep
this
from
me
see
why
i
did
can
i
trust
you
not
to
abuse
my
kindness
mean
it
will
be
wholly
dishonourable
if
you
make
any
attempt
to
discover
her
after
this
do
so
and
we
are
friends
no
longer
can
you
exact
any
such
promise
as
that
i
am
within
my
right
in
exacting
it
i
make
a
bargain
with
you
walter
for
two
years
from
now
thyrza
remains
under
my
guardianship
at
the
end
of
that
time
you
are
at
liberty
to
see
her
i
give
you
my
word
that
neither
directly
nor
indirectly
will
i
seek
to
influence
her
affections
as
regards
either
you
or
grail
i
shall
never
speak
to
her
on
such
subjects
nor
will
any
one
with
whom
i
have
authority
is
it
agreed
poor
heart
again
beating
out
the
seconds
grail
know
where
she
is
living
will
not
she
must
see
her
sister
from
time
to
time
but
it
shall
be
away
from
her
ordinary
dwelling
and
thyrza
will
understand
the
conditions
i
shall
offer
her
no
explanation
it
shall
merely
be
my
desire
and
if
she
prove
untrustworthy
in
this
small
matter
i
think
you
will
admit
that
no
harm
has
been
done
you
and
i
will
only
have
a
new
light
on
her
character
it
is
very
simple
provided
that
we
two
can
trust
each
other
and
that
thyrza
is
what
you
think
her
i
need
not
say
that
she
will
not
be
living
here
you
can
freely
come
to
me
as
often
as
you
please
would
he
never
reply
two
years
that
is
a
long
time
at
all
the
circumstances
considered
are
you
afraid
of
submitting
your
love
to
the
test
asked
me
to
trust
you
implicitly
it
is
a
great
thing
you
being
my
enemy
to
begin
with
enemy
well
then
your
enemy
and
still
i
ask
you
to
trust
me
i
have
never
yet
betrayed
man
or
woman
walter
that
i
know
well
forgive
me
on
this
day
this
day
of
the
month
two
years
hence
i
may
go
to
her
this
day
of
the
month
two
years
hence
is
it
a
bargain
agree
thyrza
could
not
be
in
safer
keeping
he
went
on
a
load
you
have
lifted
from
me
if
that
suspense
had
continued
much
longer
i
do
know
how
i
should
have
borne
it
and
you
were
with
her
in
her
illness
tell
me
about
her
was
she
gravely
ill
tell
me
where
you
found
her
it
is
needless
i
am
a
bad
one
to
hear
love
confidences
i
get
impatient
and
am
apt
to
be
satirical
i
shall
never
talk
to
you
of
thyrza
if
she
falls
ill
again
i
must
know
hope
for
better
things
tell
me
just
one
thing
before
we
change
the
subject
what
is
your
opinion
of
her
sister
what
do
you
really
know
of
her
know
nothing
save
what
i
have
gathered
from
thyrza
talk
and
from
grail
i
never
saw
her
but
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
she
is
of
sterling
character
let
it
be
now
come
in
with
me
i
suppose
you
have
had
no
thought
for
such
a
foolish
ceremony
as
dinner
their
voices
passed
into
silence
by
this
time
it
was
dark
and
the
tall
chestnuts
beyond
the
house
rustled
in
a
cool
breeze
from
the
sea
thyrza
did
not
move
for
several
minutes
when
at
length
she
endeavoured
to
rise
her
numbed
limbs
would
scarcely
sustain
her
she
looked
up
and
saw
the
yellow
crescent
of
a
young
moon
sailing
in
a
sky
of
delicate
pearl
hue
one
glance
at
the
upper
windows
of
the
house
and
then
with
strength
which
seemed
to
pass
into
her
limbs
from
the
sharp
air
she
set
out
for
the
cottage
which
was
her
present
home
chapter
xxix
together
again
lydia
held
desperately
to
hope
through
the
days
and
the
nights
from
all
others
thyrza
might
hide
away
but
could
she
persist
in
cruelty
to
her
sister
surely
in
some
way
a
message
if
only
a
message
would
be
delivered
at
least
there
would
come
a
word
to
relieve
this
unendurable
suspense
every
added
day
of
silence
was
an
added
fear
unable
to
associate
with
acquaintances
to
whom
thyrza
name
had
become
an
unfailing
source
of
vulgar
gossip
she
changed
her
place
of
work
work
had
still
to
be
done
be
her
heart
ever
so
sore
the
meals
must
be
earned
though
now
they
were
eaten
in
solitude
and
she
worked
harder
than
ever
for
it
was
her
dread
that
at
any
moment
she
might
hear
of
thyrza
in
distress
or
danger
and
she
must
have
money
laid
by
for
such
an
emergency
all
means
of
inquiry
were
used
save
that
of
going
to
the
and
having
the
event
made
public
through
the
newspapers
neither
lydia
nor
gilbert
could
bear
to
do
that
even
after
they
felt
assured
that
the
child
was
somewhere
wandering
alone
totty
nancarrow
was
an
active
ally
in
the
search
though
lydia
did
not
know
it
totty
as
soon
as
that
unfortunate
game
of
with
luke
ackroyd
had
come
to
an
end
experienced
a
revival
of
all
her
kindness
for
thyrza
privately
she
was
of
opinion
that
no
faith
whatever
should
be
given
to
egremont
in
concert
with
ackroyd
she
even
planned
an
elaborate
scheme
for
tracking
egremont
in
his
goings
hither
and
thither
they
discovered
that
he
was
very
seldom
at
his
rooms
in
great
russell
street
but
their
resources
did
not
allow
them
to
keep
a
watch
upon
him
when
he
was
away
from
town
which
appeared
to
be
very
frequently
the
case
circumstances
of
a
darkly
suggestive
kind
they
accumulated
in
abundance
and
for
weeks
constantly
believed
themselves
on
the
point
of
discovering
something
bunce
was
taken
into
their
confidence
but
he
poor
fellow
had
occupation
enough
for
his
leisure
at
home
since
bessie
was
at
eastbourne
little
nelly
bunce
often
fretted
in
vain
for
the
attentions
of
nanco
upon
whom
she
had
begun
to
feel
a
claim
nanco
for
the
nonce
a
female
detective
had
little
time
for
nursing
and
gilbert
grail
was
once
more
going
to
his
daily
labour
not
at
the
same
factory
however
for
he
too
could
not
mix
with
men
who
knew
him
about
a
fortnight
after
the
day
on
which
he
should
have
been
married
he
got
a
place
at
in
battersea
he
could
not
leave
the
house
in
walnut
tree
walk
for
he
as
persistently
as
lydia
clung
to
the
hope
that
thyrza
might
reappear
in
her
home
some
night
to
go
away
would
be
to
say
for
ever
to
that
dream
which
had
so
glorified
a
few
months
of
his
life
and
in
spite
of
all
he
could
not
do
that
in
comparison
with
his
own
the
suffering
of
others
seemed
trifling
when
his
mother
went
about
in
silence
bending
more
than
she
had
done
all
interest
in
the
things
of
life
and
in
her
studies
of
swedenborg
at
an
end
he
thought
that
much
of
it
was
due
to
her
wish
to
show
sympathy
with
him
when
lydia
sat
through
an
hour
with
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
he
knew
that
the
day
had
been
very
dark
and
weary
with
her
but
said
in
himself
that
a
sister
love
was
little
compared
with
such
as
his
he
would
not
reason
on
what
had
happened
save
when
to
do
so
with
lydia
brought
him
comfort
alone
he
brooded
over
his
hope
it
was
the
only
way
to
save
himself
from
madness
on
the
day
after
seeing
egremont
he
received
a
long
letter
from
him
egremont
wrote
from
his
heart
and
with
a
force
of
sincerity
which
must
have
swept
away
any
doubts
had
such
still
lingered
with
the
reader
the
inevitable
antagonism
of
the
personal
interview
was
a
pain
in
his
memory
if
the
intercourse
of
friendship
was
for
ever
at
an
end
for
them
he
could
not
bear
to
part
in
this
way
with
hesitating
words
with
doubts
and
reticences
your
bitter
misery
he
said
may
accuse
me
of
affecting
sympathy
which
i
do
not
feel
and
may
scorn
my
expressions
of
grief
as
a
cheap
way
of
saving
my
i
will
not
compare
my
suffering
with
yours
but
none
the
less
it
is
intense
this
is
the
first
great
sorrow
of
my
life
and
i
do
not
think
a
keener
one
will
ever
befall
me
keep
this
letter
by
you
do
not
be
content
to
read
it
once
and
throw
it
aside
for
i
have
spoken
to
you
out
of
my
deepest
feeling
and
in
time
you
will
do
me
more
justice
than
you
can
now
and
further
on
to
that
which
has
parted
us
there
must
be
no
ambiguity
no
pretence
of
superhuman
generosity
i
should
lie
if
i
said
that
i
do
not
wish
to
find
thyrza
for
my
own
sake
if
i
find
her
i
shall
ask
her
to
be
my
wife
i
wanted
to
say
this
when
we
spoke
together
but
could
not
neither
was
i
calm
enough
to
express
this
rightly
nor
you
rightly
to
hear
it
gilbert
allowed
a
day
or
two
to
go
by
then
made
answer
he
wrote
briefly
but
enough
to
show
egremont
that
the
man
natural
nobility
could
triumph
over
his
natural
resentment
it
was
a
moving
letter
its
pathos
lying
in
the
fact
that
its
writer
shunned
all
attempt
to
be
pathetic
that
i
know
the
truth
he
said
can
only
ask
your
pardon
for
the
thoughts
i
had
of
you
you
have
not
wronged
me
and
i
can
have
no
against
you
if
thyrza
is
ever
your
wife
i
hope
your
happiness
may
be
hers
as
for
the
other
things
do
not
reproach
yourself
you
wished
to
befriend
me
and
i
think
i
was
not
unworthy
of
it
few
things
in
life
turn
out
as
we
desire
to
have
done
one
best
with
a
good
intention
is
much
to
look
back
upon
very
few
have
more
gilbert
did
not
show
this
letter
to
lydia
nor
had
he
told
her
of
what
he
had
learnt
in
the
conversation
with
egremont
the
fear
would
have
seemed
more
intolerable
if
he
had
uttered
it
but
the
hope
which
supported
him
was
proof
against
even
such
a
danger
as
this
to
his
mind
there
was
something
unnatural
in
a
union
between
egremont
and
thyrza
try
as
he
would
he
could
not
realise
it
as
having
come
to
pass
the
two
were
parted
by
so
vast
a
social
distinction
and
let
nature
say
what
it
will
the
artificialities
of
life
are
wont
to
prevail
he
could
imagine
an
unpermitted
bond
between
them
with
the
necessary
end
in
thyrza
sacrifice
to
the
world
injustice
but
their
marriage
appeared
to
him
among
the
things
so
unlikely
as
to
be
in
practice
impossible
of
course
the
wish
was
father
to
the
thought
but
he
reasoned
upon
the
hope
which
would
not
abandon
him
thyrza
had
again
and
again
proved
the
extreme
sensitiveness
of
her
nature
she
could
not
bear
to
inflict
pain
he
remembered
how
she
had
once
come
back
after
saying
because
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
spoken
with
insufficient
kindness
the
instance
was
typical
and
now
though
tempted
by
every
motive
that
can
tempt
a
woman
she
had
abandoned
herself
to
unimagined
trials
rather
than
seek
her
own
welfare
at
another
expense
to
fulfil
her
promise
had
been
beyond
her
power
but
if
there
must
be
suffering
she
would
share
it
and
now
in
that
wretched
exile
he
knew
that
could
not
absorb
her
she
would
think
of
him
constantly
and
of
such
thought
would
come
compassion
and
repentance
those
feelings
might
bring
her
back
if
only
she
came
back
it
was
enough
she
could
not
undo
what
she
had
done
but
neither
could
she
forbid
him
to
live
with
eyes
on
the
future
reasoning
so
he
did
his
daily
work
and
lived
waiting
then
came
the
day
which
put
a
term
to
the
mere
blank
of
desolation
and
excited
new
hopes
new
fears
thyrza
letter
arrived
it
was
delivered
in
the
afternoon
and
lydia
found
it
pushed
under
her
door
when
she
returned
from
work
she
listened
for
gilbert
coming
home
then
ran
down
to
the
and
without
speaking
put
the
letter
into
his
hand
grail
was
present
knew
it
had
come
she
said
in
her
low
voice
which
of
late
had
begun
to
quaver
with
the
feebleness
of
age
jarmey
brought
it
here
to
show
me
because
she
guessed
who
it
was
from
gilbert
said
very
few
words
and
when
he
returned
the
letter
lydia
went
upstairs
with
it
to
nurse
the
treasure
in
solitude
it
lay
on
her
lap
and
again
and
again
she
read
it
through
every
word
she
probed
for
meanings
every
stroke
of
the
pen
she
dwelt
on
as
possibly
revealing
something
have
been
poorly
dear
but
i
am
quite
well
again
now
that
sentence
was
the
one
her
eye
always
turned
to
the
writing
was
not
quite
the
same
as
thyrza
used
to
be
it
showed
weakness
she
thought
she
had
foreseen
this
that
thyrza
would
fall
ill
in
fear
of
that
she
had
deprived
herself
of
all
save
the
barest
necessaries
that
she
might
save
a
little
money
but
strangers
had
tended
her
sister
and
with
her
gladness
at
receiving
news
mingled
jealousy
of
the
hands
that
had
been
preferred
to
her
own
only
now
the
bitterness
of
separation
seemed
to
be
tasted
to
the
full
at
nine
she
went
downstairs
again
knowing
that
she
would
find
gilbert
alone
he
was
sitting
unoccupied
as
always
now
in
the
evenings
for
his
books
gathered
dust
on
the
unregarded
shelves
seeing
that
she
had
the
letter
with
her
he
held
out
his
hand
for
it
in
silence
one
thing
i
afraid
of
lydia
began
when
she
had
glanced
at
him
once
or
twice
you
think
it
friends
of
that
she
with
he
shook
his
head
would
have
told
me
if
he
found
her
you
quite
sure
i
am
sure
he
would
have
said
where
she
was
very
likely
but
he
tell
us
that
she
was
found
gilbert
had
reason
to
think
of
lydia
as
a
great
power
on
his
side
the
girl
was
now
implacable
against
egremont
she
had
ceased
to
utter
her
thoughts
about
him
since
she
knew
that
they
pained
her
friend
but
in
her
heart
she
kept
a
determined
enmity
the
fact
of
thyrza
love
in
no
way
influenced
her
her
imagination
was
not
strong
enough
to
enable
her
to
put
herself
in
thyrza
place
and
see
egremont
as
her
sister
saw
him
with
the
narrowness
of
view
which
is
common
enough
in
good
and
women
she
could
only
regard
him
as
the
disturber
of
happiness
the
ruin
of
thyrza
prospects
lydia
was
not
ambitious
she
had
never
been
enthusiastic
about
gilbert
promotion
to
the
librarianship
and
doubtless
it
would
have
pleased
her
just
as
well
for
thyrza
to
marry
grail
if
the
latter
had
had
no
thought
of
quitting
his
familiar
work
consequently
it
was
no
difficulty
to
her
to
leave
altogether
out
of
sight
egremont
purposed
benefits
to
gilbert
she
no
longer
believed
that
he
was
innocent
of
designs
in
his
intercourse
with
thyrza
this
change
was
a
natural
enough
consequence
of
character
just
as
it
had
been
perfectly
natural
for
her
to
think
and
speak
as
she
had
done
under
the
first
shock
of
her
sister
flight
since
then
she
had
suffered
terribly
and
the
suffering
turned
her
against
him
who
was
the
plain
cause
of
it
is
the
on
the
envelope
gilbert
asked
lydia
continuing
to
brood
over
her
jealousies
and
dreads
the
stamp
was
cross
small
help
derivable
from
that
does
even
say
whether
she
write
again
lydia
murmured
gilbert
said
presently
shall
write
to
egremont
and
tell
him
that
we
have
heard
no
lydia
protested
indignantly
should
you
tell
him
you
must
do
that
gilbert
i
do
want
him
to
know
promised
him
lyddy
of
course
i
should
tell
him
where
she
was
if
we
knew
but
i
promised
to
let
him
hear
if
we
had
any
news
i
do
see
why
you
promised
such
a
thing
it
does
concern
him
gilbert
was
troubled
by
this
persistence
lydia
spoke
with
earnest
disapproval
he
could
not
do
as
he
wished
in
defiance
of
her
yet
he
must
certainly
keep
his
promise
to
egremont
must
remember
he
said
gently
he
has
reason
to
be
anxious
as
well
as
we
have
we
to
do
with
that
she
replied
stubbornly
has
no
right
to
think
anything
about
her
mean
lyddy
that
he
is
troubled
because
of
our
trouble
all
i
want
to
do
is
to
tell
him
that
a
letter
has
come
from
thyrza
without
address
and
that
she
says
she
has
found
friends
wo
you
consent
to
that
after
a
short
silence
lydia
replied
wo
say
any
more
gilbert
as
you
like
that
not
enough
i
must
have
your
full
agreement
it
either
right
or
wrong
to
do
it
and
you
must
make
up
your
mind
clearly
should
wonder
if
he
knows
she
said
briefly
does
know
i
shall
not
distrust
him
again
he
would
have
told
me
you
had
better
write
see
that
i
ought
to
as
you
promised
but
i
ca
see
why
you
did
this
form
of
consent
had
to
suffice
feminine
as
it
was
but
gilbert
knew
lydia
well
by
this
time
and
no
trifling
fault
could
touch
his
deep
affection
and
respect
for
her
she
was
very
lonely
in
these
days
lydia
of
her
own
sex
she
had
now
no
friend
unless
it
were
poor
old
grail
by
changing
her
place
of
employment
she
had
lost
even
the
satisfaction
of
being
among
familiar
faces
and
her
new
thought
her
dull
the
jokes
and
gossip
of
each
morning
were
things
of
the
past
she
plied
her
needle
every
moment
of
the
working
day
her
thoughts
fixed
on
one
unchanging
subject
yes
for
she
could
not
really
think
even
of
ackroyd
he
was
always
it
is
true
a
presence
in
her
mind
but
there
was
no
more
pondering
about
him
every
stitch
at
the
lining
of
a
hat
meant
a
fraction
of
a
coin
and
each
day
result
was
to
have
earned
something
towards
the
money
saved
for
thyrza
assistance
with
mary
bower
she
spoke
no
longer
not
even
formal
words
that
insult
on
the
miserable
night
had
been
a
blow
mary
could
not
soon
forgive
for
it
came
just
at
the
moment
when
having
heard
her
parents
talk
about
thyrza
she
was
sincerely
anxious
to
reunite
herself
to
her
former
friend
and
be
what
comfort
to
her
she
might
so
now
whenever
lydia
went
to
see
boddy
she
gave
a
private
signal
at
the
side
door
and
the
old
man
descended
to
admit
her
then
totty
nancarrow
strangely
lydia
could
now
have
been
almost
friends
with
totty
she
did
not
know
why
she
met
her
by
chance
occasionally
and
nodded
or
at
most
spoke
a
brief
greeting
yet
each
time
she
would
have
liked
to
stop
and
talk
a
little
totty
had
been
thyrza
close
friend
that
formerly
had
been
a
source
of
jealous
feeling
now
it
seemed
to
have
become
an
attraction
totty
gave
looks
that
were
not
unkind
but
did
not
make
advances
she
was
a
little
ashamed
of
the
way
she
had
behaved
when
lydia
came
to
her
for
help
lydia
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
tell
gilbert
that
she
too
wanted
to
let
someone
know
that
there
was
news
from
thyrza
after
leaving
the
parlour
she
ran
out
to
a
little
shop
in
kennington
road
and
purchased
a
sheet
of
and
an
envelope
writing
a
letter
was
by
no
means
a
simple
thing
to
lyddy
it
was
after
midnight
before
she
had
schemed
the
sentences
or
rather
the
one
long
sentence
in
which
she
should
convey
her
intelligence
to
ackroyd
several
things
were
to
be
considered
in
this
composition
first
it
must
be
as
brief
as
possible
then
it
must
be
very
formal
in
its
mode
of
address
both
these
necessities
came
of
the
consideration
that
the
letter
would
of
course
be
shown
to
totty
nancarrow
and
totty
must
have
no
cause
of
complaint
ackroyd
that
was
written
but
might
it
stand
it
meant
so
much
so
much
but
how
else
to
begin
did
not
everybody
begin
letters
in
that
way
she
really
could
not
say
sir
then
for
the
letter
be
finished
the
hour
was
getting
so
late
truly
lydia
trent
surely
that
was
commonplace
enough
yes
but
to
say
that
too
meant
so
much
was
she
not
indeed
his
and
might
not
totty
suspect
something
in
that
you
see
that
lyddy
was
made
a
very
philosopher
by
love
she
had
acquired
all
at
once
the
power
of
seeing
through
the
outward
show
of
things
of
perceiving
what
really
lies
below
our
conventional
forms
well
the
letter
had
to
stand
she
had
no
second
sheet
of
and
she
had
no
more
time
for
the
weary
eyes
and
hands
must
get
their
rest
for
toil
she
closed
the
envelope
and
addressed
it
then
the
ink
being
dry
she
put
the
written
name
just
for
an
instant
to
her
lips
totty
could
not
divine
that
and
it
was
not
so
great
a
wrong
perhaps
lydia
would
not
have
done
it
but
that
the
great
burden
upon
her
was
for
the
moment
lightened
and
she
longed
to
tell
someone
how
thankful
she
was
would
he
reply
by
letter
or
would
he
make
an
opportunity
of
seeing
her
since
the
forming
of
that
sudden
intimacy
under
the
pressure
of
misery
he
and
she
had
not
seen
each
other
often
they
always
spoke
if
they
met
and
lydia
was
very
grateful
to
him
for
the
invariable
kindness
of
his
voice
and
his
look
but
of
course
it
was
not
to
be
expected
not
to
be
desired
that
they
should
sustain
the
habit
of
conversing
together
as
close
friends
ackroyd
had
evidently
remembered
that
it
was
unwise
perhaps
he
had
reported
the
matter
to
totty
with
the
result
that
totty
had
pronounced
a
quiet
opinion
which
it
was
only
becoming
in
him
to
respect
he
wrote
back
the
letter
came
as
speedily
as
could
have
been
expected
miss
trent
and
truly
even
as
she
had
written
how
can
one
write
such
words
and
mean
nothing
by
them
but
he
said
me
yours
truly
ah
she
would
never
have
ventured
upon
that
to
be
sure
it
meant
nothing
nothing
but
she
liked
that
me
he
said
he
was
very
glad
indeed
that
thyrza
had
written
and
he
hoped
earnestly
that
more
satisfactory
news
would
come
before
long
very
short
lydia
put
away
the
note
with
that
she
had
received
from
the
same
writer
one
sad
morning
in
the
how
long
ago
that
seemed
more
than
a
month
of
summer
went
by
and
lydia
waited
still
for
another
word
from
her
sister
after
each
day
disappointment
she
closed
her
eyes
saying
will
come
during
the
hours
she
spent
at
home
the
only
event
that
interested
her
was
the
passing
of
the
postman
she
watched
constantly
from
the
window
at
the
times
when
letters
were
delivered
and
if
a
rare
chance
the
man
in
uniform
stopped
at
the
door
below
she
sprang
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
hung
there
breathless
to
see
if
someone
would
come
up
no
the
letter
was
never
for
her
on
coming
home
from
work
she
always
threw
open
her
door
eagerly
for
perhaps
she
would
see
the
white
envelope
lying
on
the
floor
again
the
defeat
of
hope
always
made
the
whole
room
seem
barren
and
cold
sunday
was
of
all
days
in
the
week
the
longest
and
gloomiest
on
that
day
there
was
no
postman
but
at
length
came
the
evening
when
looking
down
by
mere
dull
habit
as
she
opened
her
room
door
behold
the
white
envelope
lay
there
she
could
not
believe
that
at
last
it
was
really
in
her
hand
as
she
took
the
letter
out
there
fell
from
it
a
light
slip
of
paper
with
surprise
she
saw
that
it
was
a
order
this
time
a
full
address
stood
at
the
head
of
the
page
she
uttered
she
is
with
ormonde
and
ormonde
is
friend
hastily
her
eyes
sought
the
sense
of
what
was
written
thyrza
said
that
she
was
well
but
could
not
live
longer
without
seeing
her
sister
lydia
was
to
come
by
as
early
a
train
as
possible
on
the
following
morning
money
was
enclosed
to
provide
for
her
expenses
no
news
could
be
sent
but
in
a
few
hours
they
would
talk
to
each
other
finally
the
address
was
to
be
kept
a
secret
to
be
kept
even
from
gilbert
she
depended
upon
lydia
to
obey
her
in
this
a
postscript
added
will
easily
find
the
house
i
would
come
to
the
station
and
meet
every
train
but
i
could
bear
to
see
you
there
first
lydia
had
deep
misgivings
but
they
did
not
occupy
her
mind
for
long
she
was
going
to
see
thyrza
that
as
she
realised
it
rang
a
peal
of
joy
in
her
ears
and
made
her
forget
all
else
but
the
money
she
would
not
use
she
had
enough
to
pay
her
fare
and
in
any
case
she
would
somehow
have
obtained
it
rather
than
spend
this
which
came
she
knew
not
from
whom
it
might
be
that
thyrza
had
earned
it
but
perhaps
it
was
given
to
her
by
an
enemy
under
this
name
lydia
had
come
to
think
of
egremont
she
told
gilbert
in
private
the
concealment
from
him
of
address
he
seemed
to
accept
as
something
quite
natural
he
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
and
as
lydia
left
him
gave
her
a
look
whose
meaning
was
not
hard
to
understand
the
new
day
did
come
at
last
and
at
last
lydia
was
in
the
train
she
had
remembered
that
by
which
thyrza
went
with
bessie
and
she
took
the
same
a
strange
feeling
she
had
as
instead
of
going
to
the
she
set
off
through
the
sunshine
to
the
railway
station
a
holiday
feeling
had
she
known
what
holiday
meant
that
she
was
going
for
the
first
time
to
the
was
nothing
her
anticipation
was
only
of
thyrza
look
and
thyrza
first
kiss
why
were
all
the
other
people
who
went
by
the
same
train
so
joyous
and
so
full
of
hope
were
they
too
going
to
meet
someone
very
dear
to
them
she
had
copied
the
address
on
to
a
piece
of
paper
which
she
kept
inside
her
glove
impossible
that
she
should
forget
but
even
impossibilities
must
be
provided
for
when
she
descended
at
eastbourne
she
was
so
agitated
and
so
perplexed
by
the
novelty
of
the
experience
that
with
difficulty
she
found
her
way
into
the
street
she
hurried
on
a
little
way
then
remembered
that
the
first
thing
was
to
ask
a
direction
on
inquiring
from
a
woman
who
stood
in
a
she
at
once
had
her
course
clearly
indicated
forwards
then
as
quickly
as
she
could
walk
how
astonishingly
clean
the
streets
were
what
great
green
trees
grew
everywhere
how
bright
and
hot
was
the
sunshine
yes
this
turn
but
to
make
quite
sure
she
would
ask
again
a
policeman
in
an
unfamiliar
uniform
reassured
her
now
a
turn
to
the
right
and
of
a
sudden
everything
ceased
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
blue
sky
before
her
ah
that
was
the
sea
then
its
breath
came
with
wondrous
sweetness
on
her
heated
face
but
what
was
the
sea
to
her
along
here
to
the
left
again
she
must
be
very
near
now
again
she
asked
and
in
so
uncertain
a
voice
that
she
had
to
repeat
her
question
before
it
was
understood
number
why
it
was
just
over
yonder
the
cottage
that
seemed
to
be
built
of
some
glistening
white
stone
and
so
she
stood
at
the
door
a
child
opened
and
without
questioning
laughed
and
said
in
please
she
found
herself
at
once
in
a
comfortable
kitchen
the
child
pointed
to
an
inner
door
which
in
the
same
moment
softly
opened
so
it
had
come
at
last
once
again
they
were
heart
to
heart
lydia
cried
as
though
something
dreadful
had
befallen
her
thyrza
sobbed
once
or
twice
but
she
had
shed
so
many
tears
for
misery
that
none
would
come
at
the
bidding
of
joy
they
were
in
a
little
room
which
looked
through
a
lattice
upon
the
flat
beach
which
lies
at
this
side
of
eastbourne
in
front
was
a
black
house
of
wood
for
the
keeping
of
fishers
nets
and
fishing
boats
lay
about
it
when
lydia
emotion
had
spent
itself
thyrza
drew
her
to
the
window
threw
back
the
lattice
and
said
ca
look
at
anything
but
you
dearest
was
the
answer
let
us
look
together
just
for
a
minute
then
we
shall
come
fresh
again
to
each
other
faces
the
sea
lyddy
i
love
it
it
seems
to
me
the
best
friend
i
ever
had
very
pale
still
darling
you
been
ill
and
you
send
for
me
how
cruel
that
was
of
you
thyrza
you
might
have
got
so
bad
you
could
send
you
might
have
died
before
i
could
know
anything
dear
you
do
love
me
as
i
love
you
i
could
have
given
you
that
pain
no
not
for
any
one
not
for
any
one
in
the
world
oh
why
did
you
let
me
go
away
with
you
i
have
gone
anywhere
have
done
anything
you
asked
me
are
you
sure
you
well
again
do
you
feel
strong
what
is
it
thyrza
had
let
herself
sink
upon
a
chair
and
her
face
which
had
indeed
been
strangely
colourless
was
for
a
moment
touched
with
pain
but
she
laughed
only
with
exciting
myself
so
lyddy
i
have
stood
or
sat
still
a
minute
since
i
got
up
oh
i
as
well
as
ever
i
was
better
than
ever
i
was
in
my
life
do
i
look
happy
i
only
wanted
you
that
was
the
only
thing
i
never
felt
so
well
and
happy
somebody
knocked
at
the
door
something
for
you
to
eat
after
your
journey
said
thyrza
too
early
for
dinner
yet
but
you
must
have
just
a
mouthful
she
went
out
and
came
back
with
a
tray
on
which
was
milk
and
cake
lydia
shook
her
head
ca
eat
thyrza
i
want
you
to
tell
me
everything
sha
tell
you
anything
at
all
till
you
had
a
glass
of
milk
let
me
take
your
things
off
you
going
to
stay
with
me
you
know

still
and
let
me
take
them
off
dear
good
old
lyddy
oh

do
my
hair
for
me
tomorrow
morning

of
doing
my
hair
again
poor
old
lyddy
you
always
did
cry
when
you
were
glad
and
never
for
anything
else
shall
i
sit
on
your
lap
like
i
used
to
do
after
been
naughty
years
and
years
ago

do
know
how
old
i
am
lyddy
you
do
think

still
older
than
me
do
you
no
that
all
altered
mrs
guest
here
asked
me
how
old
i
was
the
other
day
and
i
would
tell
her
because
the
truth
was
true
i
was
so
ill
lyddy
dear
i
did
think
i
should
die
and
i
should
have
wished
to
but
for
you
i
could
send
for
you
i
was
ashamed
to
behaved
too
bad
to
you
and
to
everybody
but
people
were
kind
much
kinder
than
they
need
have
been
some
day
i
go
and
see
gandle
and
tell
her
i
have
forgotten
her
kindness
you
shall
go
with
me
lyddy
but
no
no
you
would
like
we
forget
all
about
that
was
that
thyrza
place
where
i
got
work
do
you
know
where
the
caledonian
road
is
lydia
tightened
her
embrace
as
if
shame
and
hardship
still
threatened
her
dear
one
and
she
would
guard
her
from
them
how
did
you
get
better
what
happened
then
i
was
very
bad
gandle
one
night
looked
in
my
pocket
to
see
if
i
anything
about
me
to
show
where
i
belonged
and
she
found
that
bit
of
paper
with
ormonde
name
and
address
but
wait
lyddy
i
something
to
say
did
you
do
as
i
asked
about
not
telling
any
one
where
i
was
did
tell
any
one
thyrza
nobody
knew
where
i
was
going
i
mean
of
course
i
told
gilbert
that
i
was
going
to
you
but
not
where
you
were
thyrza
after
a
short
pause
asked
very
quietly
is
gilbert
lyddy
seems
pretty
well
dear
he
has
he
felt
it
very
hard
she
kept
her
eyes
veiled
and
pressed
her
head
closer
to
shoulder
had
a
great
deal
to
go
through
dear
the
touch
of
severity
in
lydia
voice
came
of
her
thoughts
turning
to
egremont
but
thyrza
felt
herself
judged
and
rebuked
she
trembled
is
he
doing
she
asked
in
a
voice
barely
audible
goes
to
work
as
usual
it
a
new
place
gilbert
oh
i
sorry
for
him
he
never
deserved
this
of
me
lyddy
she
added
in
a
whisper
makes
you
so
cruel
to
other
people
when
you
love
anyone
lydia
found
no
answer
she
was
gazing
through
the
open
window
but
saw
nothing
of
sea
or
sky
she
then
did
not
know
what
it
was
to
love
well
love
is
of
many
kinds
i
was
going
to
say
something
lyddy
thyrza
pursued
when
a
kiss
upon
her
hair
assured
her
that
from
one
at
all
events
there
was
no
need
to
ask
forgiveness
ormonde
that
has
done
everything
for
me
and
she
does
want
anybody
to
know
nobody
except
you
she
very
kind
but
she
a
little
hard
in
some
things
and
she
thinks

to
tell
any
one

to

hers

you

able

there
but
we
shall

other
somewhere

lydia
asked
slowly

sister

for
a
time
oh
not
long
i
told
ormonde
that
i
knew

the
other
gravely
broke
the
other
promise
i
showed
gilbert
the
letter
you
left
for
me
and
i
told
him
all
you
told
me
thyrza
uttered
mechanically
could
be
helped
people
had
begun
to
talk
and
gilbert
had
heard
about
about
the
library
you
know
bower
got
to
know
somehow
i
told
you

truth

told
you
every
word
of
the
truth

you
did
thyrza
all
you
knew
what
did
people
say
about
me
no
i
do
want
to
hear
do
tell
me
that
all
over
now
and
you
could
help
telling
gilbert
i
understand
how
it
was
but
will
you
promise
me
this
other
thing
lyddy
she
raised
herself
and
looked
solemnly
into
her
sister
face
mean
more
to
me
than
you
think
if
you
refuse
or
if
you
break
your
promise
i
do
think
you
would
do
me
harm
lyddy
the
answer
was
long
in
coming
at
last
lydia
made
inquiry
does
ormonde
want
to
hide
you
thyrza
grew
agitated
means
it
for
my
good
she
believes
she
doing
the
best
been
kind
to
me
and
i
ca
say
a
word
against
her
i
think
i
ought
to
do
as
she
wants
she
seems
to
like
me
only
i
ca
tell
you
how
it
is
lyddy
i
ca
tell
any
one
no
not
even
you
worry
yourself
so
dearest
you
might
promise
me
thyrza
went
on
shaken
with
emotion
one
would
have
said
with
fear
done
wrong
to
you
and
to
gilbert
but
do
try
and
forgive
me
why
are
you
so
quiet
have
you
love
enough
for
me
to
do
just
this
she
stood
up
flushed
and
with
wild
eyes
quiet
thyrza
dearest
pleaded
her
sister
answer
me
lyddy
i
promise
me
want
to
know
one
thing
first
have
you
seen
mr
egremont
have
spoken
to
him
since
that
night
when
i
said
to
him
by
the
river
ca
you
believe
me
do
think
you
tell
me
an
untruth
i
spoken
to
him
lyddy
i
tell
you
at
once
i
would
i
tell
you
everything
must
say
what
i
mean
thyrza
it
no
good
doing
anything
else
tell
me
this
does
ormonde
want
you
to
marry
him
thyrza
laughed
strangely
then
she
exclaimed
does
she
would
hear
of
such
a
thing
not
for
the
world
she
wants
to
be
kind
to
me
in
her
own
way
but
not
that
not
that
how
you
distrust
me
are
against
me
then
what
are
you
thinking
about
i
hoped
you
would
be
kind
to
me
in
everything
you
do
look
like
my
lyddy
now
because
i
do
understand
you
said
the
other
in
a
subdued
voice
her
eyes
on
the
ground
not
open
with
me
thyrza
if
it
true
that
ormonde
thinks
in
that
way
why
do
you
she
broke
off
ca
talk
about
it
it
very
hard
to
bear
we
shall
never
be
what
we
were
to
each
other
thyrza
something
come
between
us
and
it
always
will
be
between
us
you
must
take
your
own
way
dear
yes
i
promise
and
there
an
end
of
it
thyrza
sprang
forward
is
it
you
afraid
of
she
pleaded
do
you
speak
like
this
what
are
you
thinking
think
that
egremont
know
where
you
are
he
wo
know
i
give
you
my
solemn
word
he
wo
know
you
write
to
him
perhaps
you
meant
that
when
you
said
you
to
him
meant
what
i
said
that
i
neither
written
nor
spoken
nor
him
to
me
he
wo
know
where
i
am
i
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
in
any
way
but
of
course
if
you
refuse
to
believe
me
what
the
use
of
saying
it
there
was
a
strange
intonation
in
thyrza
voice
as
she
added
these
words
she
looked
and
spoke
with
a
certain
pride
which
lydia
had
never
before
remarked
in
her
lydia
mused
a
little
then
said
do
doubt
the
truth
of
your
words
thyrza
i
promise
not
to
tell
any
one
anything
about
you
and
i
keep
my
promise
but
ca
you
tell
me
what
you
going
to
do
do
really
know
myself
ormonde
took
me
to
her
house
the
day
before
yesterday
and
there
was
a
lady
there
that
i
had
to
sing
to
i
think
she
wanted
to
see
what
sort
of
a
voice
i
had
she
played
a
sound
on
the
piano
and
asked
me
to
sing
the
same
if
i
could
she
seemed
satisfied
i
thought
though
she
did
say
anything
then
ormonde
brought
me
back
in
her
carriage
but
she
did
say
anything
about
the
singing
she
very
strange
in
some
things
you
know
lydia
asked
presently
was
it
ormonde
gave
you
this
money
and
she
took
the
order
from
her
pocket
you
did
use
it
i
had
enough
of
my
own
please
give
it
back
lyddy
how
proud
you
are
you
never
would
take
any
help
from
anybody
and
yet
you
went
on
so
about
grandad
when
he
made
bother
oh
how
is
poor
grandad
same
as
usual
dear
you
go
to
work
every
day
just
the
same
my
poor
lyddy
the
contention
was
over
and
the
tenderness
came
back
something
for
me
to
gilbert
lyddy
say
i
what
can
i
say
i
do
feel
for
him
i
can
never
forget
his
goodness
as
long
as
i
live
tell
him
to
forget
all
about
me
how
wrong
i
was
ever
to
say
that
i
loved
him
then
again
in
a
whisper
about
ackroyd
dearest
same
they
not
married
yet
i
dare
say
they
will
be
soon
they
spent
long
hours
together
by
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide
lydia
almost
forgot
her
troubles
now
and
then
as
for
thyrza
she
seemed
to
drink
ecstasy
from
the
live
air
a
good
friend
to
me
she
said
several
times
looking
out
upon
the
grey
old
deep
made
me
well
again
lyddy
i
shall
always
love
the
sound
of
it
and
the
salt
taste
on
my
lips
chapter
xxx
movements
are
going
first
of
all
to
the
pilkingtons
in
warwickshire
said
annabel
talking
with
ormonde
at
the
latter
hotel
in
the
last
week
of
july
lanyard
the
poet
you
know
will
be
there
i
am
curious
to
see
him
father
remembers
him
a
starveling
to
use
his
phrase
a
reviewer
of
novels
for
some
literary
paper
he
has
just
married
lady
emily
quell
you
heard
of
it
how
paltry
it
is
for
people
to
laugh
and
sneer
whenever
a
poor
man
marries
a
rich
woman
i
know
nothing
of
him
except
from
his
poetry
but
that
convinces
me
that
he
is
above
sordid
motives
you
do
still
retain
some
of
your
idealism
bell
that
i
ever
had
i
hope
why
you
have
feared
for
me
pitch
i
know
annabel
answered
rather
absently
letting
her
eyes
stray
mind
you
had
something
particular
to
say
to
me
mrs
ormonde
i
have
a
for
you
from
an
old
acquaintance
annabel
complexion
had
not
borne
the
season
as
well
as
those
of
women
whose
whole
and
sole
preoccupation
it
is
to
combat
nature
in
the
matter
of
their
personal
appearance
her
tint
was
as
they
say
a
little
fatigued
fatigued
too
were
her
eyes
which
seemed
ever
looking
for
something
lost
that
gaze
she
had
in
sitting
by
ullswater
with
and
lilies
on
her
lap
would
not
be
easily
recovered
her
beauty
was
of
rarer
quality
and
infinitely
more
suggestive
than
on
that
day
something
more
than
a
year
ago
to
the
modern
mind
nothing
is
complete
that
has
not
an
element
of
morbidity
at
ormonde
words
she
turned
with
grave
interest
then
is
he
going
she
asked
just
smiling
a
small
manufacturing
town
in
pennsylvania
his
firm
has
just
opened
works
there
and
he
has
it
in
view
to
prepare
himself
for
superintending
them
are
serious
i
think
it
was
chiefly
my
persuasion
that
decided
him
i
have
no
doubt
that
in
a
year
or
two
he
will
thank
me
though
he
is
not
very
ardent
about
it
at
present
surely
he
no
i
think
you
are
right
have
not
advised
him
to
become
an
american
ormonde
continued
smiling
when
annabel
abandoned
an
apparent
intention
of
saying
more
doubt
he
will
come
to
england
now
and
then
and
probably
with
his
disposition
he
will
some
day
make
his
home
here
again
i
hardly
expect
to
see
him
for
some
two
years
hope
it
is
right
i
think
it
is
annabel
paused
a
little
then
made
an
unforced
transition
to
other
matters
she
rose
to
leave
before
long
whilst
her
hand
was
in
ormonde
she
asked
i
know
anything
more
than
father
told
me
she
had
said
it
with
a
little
difficulty
but
without
confusion
of
face
did
your
father
tell
you
that
she
is
in
your
care
and
that
you
think
her
voice
can
be
cultivated
so
as
to
serve
her
i
will
tell
you
more
than
that
dear
he
is
absolutely
without
bond
as
regards
her
they
have
never
met
since
her
flight
from
home
and
more
she
has
no
suspicion
that
he
ever
took
an
interest
in
her
save
as
grail
future
wife
does
not
know
that
has
no
idea
of
it
they
have
never
exchanged
a
more
than
friendly
word
he
believed
when
absent
from
england
that
she
was
already
married
and
of
movements
since
then
she
is
wholly
ignorant
she
listened
with
frank
surprise
her
face
showed
nothing
more
than
that
she
said
hesitatingly
can
not
quite
understand
he
holds
himself
quite
without
responsibility
he
leaves
england
without
troubling
about
her
future
at
all
he
knows
i
have
her
in
my
care
she
being
my
ward
i
have
a
perfect
right
to
demand
that
the
child
fate
shall
not
be
trifled
with
that
she
shall
be
allowed
to
grow
older
and
wiser
before
any
one
asks
her
to
take
an
irrevocable
step
say
for
the
space
of
two
years
egremont
grants
my
right
and
i
have
never
yet
had
real
grounds
for
doubting
his
honour
never
doubted
it
even
on
seeming
grounds
said
annabel
quietly
are
justified
bell
well
as
you
asked
me
i
thought
it
better
to
tell
you
thus
much
he
leaves
england
morally
as
free
as
if
he
had
never
heard
her
name
more
question
how
do
you
that
she
has
no
assurance
of
his
affection
has
himself
told
me
that
there
has
been
not
a
word
of
that
between
them
the
only
other
possible
source
was
her
sister
who
has
seen
her
i
did
not
see
lydia
before
the
interview
because
it
was
repugnant
to
me
to
do
so
their
love
for
each
other
is
something
very
sacred
and
a
stranger
had
no
right
to
come
between
them
before
they
met
but
i
subsequently
saw
lydia
in
london
she
soon
spoke
to
me
very
freely
and
i
found
that
she
almost
hated
me
because
she
thought
i
was
planning
to
marry
her
sister
to
egremont
i
also
found
out
i
am
old
you
know
bell
and
can
be
very
deceitful
that
lydia
no
more
than
her
sister
suspects
serious
feeling
on
his
part
she
scorned
the
suggestion
of
such
a
possibility
it
is
her
greatest
hope
that
thyrza
may
yet
marry
mr
grail
what
can
you
tell
me
of
thyrza
herself
has
been
ill
but
seems
now
in
very
fair
health
the
day
she
spent
with
lydia
evidently
did
her
a
vast
amount
of
good
that
natural
affection
is
an
invaluable
resource
to
her
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
it
will
be
the
means
of
recovering
happiness
for
me
she
is
quiet
but
not
seriously
depressed
sometimes
she
is
even
bright
the
singing
lessons
have
begun
and
she
enjoys
them
i
think
a
new
interest
has
been
given
her
i
hope
a
very
sad
beautiful
face
will
no
longer
haunt
me
thus
did
two
ladies
transact
the
most
weighty
part
of
their
business
after
shaking
hands
for
an
analogy
to
the
proverbial
postscript
perhaps
the
same
evening
there
was
a
at
the
tyrrells
newthorpe
had
as
usual
kept
to
his
own
room
annabel
went
thither
to
sit
with
him
for
a
while
after
the
visitors
were
gone
he
had
a
poem
that
he
wished
to
read
to
her
there
was
generally
some
scrap
of
prose
or
verse
waiting
for
her
when
she
went
into
the
study
annabel
could
not
give
the
usual
attention
newthorpe
noticed
this
and
laying
the
book
aside
made
one
or
two
inquiries
about
the
company
of
the
evening
she
replied
briefly
then
after
hesitation
asked
you
very
much
want
to
go
to
the
pilkingtons
father
he
regarded
her
with
amazement
since
when
have
i
had
a
passionate
desire
to
camp
in
houses
and
eat
strange
flesh
you
do
greatly
care
about
it
even
for
the
sake
of
meeting
mr
lanyard
great
heavens
the
fellow
has
done
some
fine
things
but
spiritual
converse
with
him
is
quite
enough
for
me
will
you
please
to
discover
all
at
once
that
you
are
really
not
so
well
as
you
thought
and
that
after
your
season
dancing
and
you
feel
obliged
to
get
hack
either
to
eastbourne
or
ullswater
as
soon
as
possible
fact
is
bell
i
have
felt
by
any
means
up
to
the
mark
these
last
few
days
father
do
say
that
i
am
wrong
to
speak
lightly
of
such
things
only
say
it
because
you
ask
me
to
in
truth
i
feel
very
comfortable
but
i
shall
be
far
more
sure
of
remaining
so
at
eastbourne
than
at
the
pilkingtons
you
think
as
you
please
bell
eastbourne
again
she
came
to
her
father
and
took
his
hands
tired
tired
tired
of
it
all
dear
tired
and
weary
unutterably
if
ever
we
come
to
london
again
let
us
tell
nobody
and
take
quiet
rooms
in
some
shabby
quarter
and
go
to
the
national
gallery
and
to
the
marbles
at
the
museum
and
all
places
where
we
are
sure
of
never
meeting
a
soul
who
belongs
to
the
fashionable
world
if
we
go
to
a
concert
we
sit
in
the
gallery
among
people
who
come
because
they
really
want
to
hear
music
the
stairs
are
portentous
bell
mind
the
stairs
nay
then
we
wo
go
to
public
concerts
at
all
but
i
will
play
for
you
and
myself
beginning
when
we
like
and
leaving
off
when
we
like
and
using
imagination
thank
goodness
we
both
have
some
to
make
up
for
the
defects
we
go
back
to
our
books
oh
have
never
left
them
but
i
poor
sinner
that
i
am
give
me
my
dante
and
let
me
feel
him
between
my
hands
where
is
virgil
heu
fuge
crudeles
terras
fuge
litus
avarum
is
it
quoted
right
is
it
apropos
word
of
fate
mine
too
how
have
you
been
so
patient
with
me
a
london
season
and
i
still
have
homer
to
read
still
have
sophocles
for
an
unknown
land
my
father
i
have
gone
far
very
far
astray
and
you
did
not
so
much
as
rebuke
me
dearest
it
is
infinitely
better
to
hear
you
rebuke
yourself
nor
that
either
a
chapter
in
your
education
was
lacking
now
you
can
go
on
smoothly
read
the
poem
over
again
father
i
can
hear
it
now
paula
came
to
the
house
next
morning
she
and
annabel
had
seen
very
little
of
each
other
throughout
the
season
but
on
the
last
two
or
three
occasions
of
their
meeting
paula
had
betrayed
a
sort
of
timid
desire
to
speak
with
more
intimacy
than
was
her
wont
annabel
was
not
eager
in
response
hut
in
spite
of
that
letter
which
you
remember
she
had
always
judged
her
cousin
with
much
tolerance
and
a
suspicion
that
paula
dalmaine
was
not
quite
so
happy
a
person
as
paula
tyrrell
had
been
inclined
her
to
speak
with
gentleness
they
were
alone
together
this
morning
in
the
you
going
to
the
pilkingtons
paula
said
when
she
had
fluttered
about
a
good
deal
we
have
changed
our
minds
we
go
back
to
eastbourne
how
that
bell
are
a
little
tired
of
society
and
father
needs
quietness
again
where
do
you
go
scotland
with
the
scalpers
lord
glenroich
is
going
down
with
us
he
promised
to
teach
me
to
shoot
paula
spoke
of
these
arrangements
with
less
gusto
than
might
have
been
expected
of
her
she
was
fidgety
and
absent
suddenly
she
asked
has
become
of
egremont
bell
has
either
gone
or
is
just
going
to
america
to
live
there
i
believe
for
some
time
indeed
anybody
i
wonder
has
not
told
me
anything
of
his
affairs
paula
you
have
seen
him
i
have
be
cross
with
me
bell
i
do
mean
anything
i
only
wanted
to
know
something
true
about
him
i
can
hear
lies
enough
whenever
i
choose
it
was
pathetic
enough
because
for
once
evidently
sincere
annabel
smiled
and
made
no
reply
then
with
abrupt
change
of
subject
paula
remarked
think
i
shall
come
and
see
you
at
eastbourne
if
you
let
me
shall
be
glad
you
wo
exactly
be
glad
bell
but
of
course
i
know
you
could
say
you
be
sorry
still
i
shall
come
for
a
day
or
two
all
by
myself
and
heartily
welcome
paula
now
that
does
sound
a
little
different
i
do
often
hear
people
speak
like
that
she
nodded
a
careless
and
at
once
left
the
house
she
went
straight
home
dalmaine
was
absent
at
paula
ate
nothing
and
talked
fretfully
to
the
servant
about
the
provision
that
was
made
for
her
though
she
never
took
the
least
trouble
to
see
that
her
domestic
concerns
went
properly
she
idled
about
the
till
three
a
visitor
came
her
instructions
were
at
home
at
three
she
ordered
a
hansom
to
be
summoned
instead
of
her
own
carriage
and
having
dressed
with
nervous
rapidity
she
ran
downstairs
and
entered
the
vehicle
to
the
british
museum
she
spoke
up
to
the
cabman
through
the
trap
but
just
as
the
horse
was
starting
it
stopped
again
looking
about
her
in
annoyance
she
found
that
her
husband
had
bidden
the
driver
pull
up
and
that
he
was
standing
by
the
wheel
are
you
going
he
asked
smilingly
see
a
friend
why
do
you
stop
me
when
i
in
a
hurry
tell
him
to
drive
on
at
once
she
was
obeyed
and
as
the
vehicle
rolled
on
she
leaned
back
suffering
a
little
from
palpitation
it
was
a
long
drive
to
great
russell
street
and
once
or
twice
she
all
but
altered
her
direction
to
the
man
however
she
was
on
the
pavement
by
the
museum
gates
at
last
when
the
cab
had
driven
away
she
crossed
the
street
she
went
to
the
house
where
egremont
had
his
rooms
egremont
was
at
home
please
to
give
him
this
card
and
ask
if
he
is
at
liberty
she
was
guided
up
to
the
first
floor
she
entered
a
room
and
found
egremont
standing
in
the
midst
of
he
affected
to
be
in
no
way
surprised
at
the
visit
and
shook
hands
naturally
find
me
in
a
state
of
disorder
dalmaine
he
said
excuse
it
i
start
on
a
long
journey
morning
paula
murmured
phrases
she
was
hot
and
wished
in
her
heart
that
she
had
not
done
this
crazy
thing
really
she
could
not
quite
say
why
she
had
done
it
you
going
to
america
again
mr
egremont
heard
so
i
knew
you
would
come
to
say
to
me
so
i
came
to
you
she
was
looking
about
for
signs
of
female
occupation
none
whatever
were
discoverable
are
kind
wo
stay
of
course
you
are
very
busy
hope
you
will
let
me
give
you
a
cup
of
tea
no
thank
you
it
was
only
just
to
speak
a
word
and
to
ask
you
to
forget
some
very
bad
behaviour
of
mine
you
know
what
i
mean
of
course
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
but
i
could
help
it
i
so
glad
i
came
just
in
time
to
see
you
i
should
have
been
awfully
vexed
if
i
if
i
could
have
asked
you
to
forgive
me
have
nothing
whatever
to
forgive
but
i
think
it
very
kind
of
you
to
have
come
come
back
again
some
day
likely
i
think
i
say
he
looked
into
her
face
and
saw
how
pretty
and
sweet
it
was
and
felt
sorry
for
her
he
did
not
know
why
their
hands
held
together
a
moment
or
two
no
no
message
i
can
deliver
for
you
egremont
i
to
be
trusted
i
am
indeed
very
sure
you
are
miss
tyrrell
oh
pardon
me
no
i
sha
forgive
you
she
was
laughing
yet
almost
crying
at
the
same
time
must
ask
me
to
do
something
for
you
in
return
for
that
how
strange
that
did
seem
it
was
like
having
been
dead
and
coming
to
life
again
was
it
have
no
message
whatever
for
anybody
dalmaine
thank
you
very
much
then
no
no
do
come
down
she
drove
back
home
she
had
been
sitting
for
an
hour
in
her
boudoir
when
dalmaine
came
in
he
smiled
but
looked
rather
grim
for
all
that
seating
himself
opposite
her
he
asked
what
was
your
business
in
great
russell
street
this
afternoon
she
trembled
but
returned
his
gaze
scornfully
you
followed
me
followed
you
it
is
not
exactly
usual
i
believe
for
young
married
ladies
to
visit
men
in
their
rooms
if
i
have
misunderstood
the
social
rules
in
this
matter
you
will
of
course
correct
me
dalmaine
was
to
the
core
a
politician
he
was
fond
of
paula
in
a
way
but
he
had
discovered
since
his
marriage
that
she
had
a
certain
individuality
very
distinct
from
his
own
and
till
this
was
crushed
he
could
not
be
satisfied
it
was
his
home
policy
at
present
to
crush
paula
will
he
practised
upon
her
the
faculties
which
he
would
have
liked
to
use
in
terrorising
a
people
since
she
had
given
up
talking
politics
her
had
been
full
of
people
whom
dalmaine
regarded
with
contempt
mere
butterflies
of
the
season
she
had
aggressively
emphasised
the
difference
between
his
social
tastes
and
hers
he
bore
with
it
temporarily
till
he
could
elaborate
a
plan
of
campaign
now
the
plan
had
formed
itself
in
most
unhoped
completeness
and
he
was
happy
did
you
want
with
that
fellow
he
asked
coldly
egremont
is
going
to
america
and
i
wanted
to
say
to
him
he
was
my
friend
long
before
i
knew
you
she
rose
and
would
have
gone
but
he
stopped
her
with
a
gentle
hand
this
is
very
unsatisfactory
do
you
want
what
am
i
to
do
sit
down
and
listen
as
i
have
such
very
grave
grounds
for
distrusting
you
i
can
only
pursue
one
course
i
must
claim
your
entire
obedience
to
certain
commands
i
am
now
going
to
detail
refusal
will
of
course
drive
me
to
the
most
painful
extremities
do
you
want
you
were
to
give
your
last
you
will
at
once
send
a
notice
to
all
your
guests
that
you
are
ill
and
can
not
receive
them
how
can
i
do
such
a
thing
will
do
it
we
spoke
of
going
to
scotland
with
the
scalpers
instead
of
that
you
accompany
me
to
manchester
when
parliament
rises
and
you
live
with
me
there
in
retirement
whilst
i
am
occupied
with
my
study
of
the
factory
questions
which
immediately
interest
me
paula
was
silent
are
my
commands
the
alternative
to
obedience
is
you
know
what
pray
let
me
know
your
decision
do
you
behave
to
me
in
this
way
what
have
i
done
to
be
treated
like
this
do
not
ask
me
i
wait
for
your
answer
can
only
give
in
to
you
and
you
coward
enough
to
take
advantage
of
it
undertake
to
obey
me
want
to
go
to
my
room
can
i
do
so
without
asking
are
mistress
of
my
house
paula
as
long
as
you
obey
me
in
essential
matters
paula
disappeared
and
dalmaine
sat
reflecting
with
much
on
the
firmness
and
suavity
he
had
displayed
chapter
xxxi
an
old
man
rest
it
was
not
without
much
reluctance
much
debate
with
conscience
that
bunce
allowed
his
child
to
remain
at
eastbourne
he
could
not
of
course
have
finally
refused
consent
to
a
plan
which
might
be
the
means
of
saving
bessie
life
and
to
be
relieved
of
the
cost
of
her
support
receiving
into
the
bargain
a
small
monthly
sum
which
ormonde
represented
as
the
value
to
her
of
bessie
services
at
the
chestnuts
was
a
great
consideration
to
a
man
in
his
perpetual
state
of
struggle
to
make
ends
meet
but
he
had
a
suspicion
that
ormonde
desired
to
get
the
girl
away
from
him
that
bessie
might
be
as
he
would
have
phrased
it
perverted
to
the
debasing
superstition
of
christianity
ormonde
had
interviews
with
him
and
it
helped
her
to
understand
the
man
she
soon
found
out
what
it
was
that
troubled
him
and
went
directly
to
the
point
with
an
assurance
that
no
attempt
whatever
should
be
made
to
prejudice
bessie
against
her
father
views
any
printed
matter
he
chose
to
send
her
would
be
uninterfered
with
another
woman
would
have
thought
bunce
a
mere
bear
when
she
parted
with
him
but
ormonde
had
that
blessed
gift
of
divination
which
comes
of
vast
charity
she
did
not
misjudge
him
and
he
in
turn
though
he
went
away
with
his
face
still
set
in
the
look
of
pride
which
it
had
assumed
when
he
entered
found
in
a
day
or
two
that
tones
made
a
memory
as
pleasant
as
any
he
had
he
felt
a
little
uncomfortable
in
remembering
how
ungraciously
he
had
borne
himself
another
woman
there
was
who
had
begun
to
exercise
influence
of
an
indefinable
kind
on
the
rugged
fellow
a
woman
whom
he
saw
a
good
deal
of
and
to
whom
he
had
grown
accustomed
to
look
for
a
good
deal
of
help
this
was
miss
totty
nancarrow
totty
was
no
slight
help
with
little
nelly
and
even
with
jack
for
the
former
she
ceased
to
be
nanco
and
became
simply
to
jack
she
was
a
most
estimable
acquaintance
who
never
grudged
flattering
wonder
at
his
school
achievements
even
though
they
involved
no
more
than
a
mastery
of
compound
multiplication
and
occasionally
he
felt
a
wish
that
some
one
of
his
schoolfellows
would
call
miss
nancarrow
names
that
he
might
punch
the
rascal
head
but
in
the
father
mind
there
was
an
obstacle
to
complete
appreciation
totty
was
a
roman
catholic
she
often
went
to
george
cathedral
in
southwark
and
even
for
the
purpose
of
confession
when
this
fact
was
strongly
before
bunce
consciousness
he
was
inclined
to
scorn
totty
and
to
feel
an
uneasiness
about
her
associating
with
his
children
somehow
the
scorn
and
the
mistrust
would
not
hold
out
in
totty
presence
he
found
himself
taking
more
pains
to
be
polite
to
her
than
to
any
other
person
when
she
had
had
nelly
in
her
room
and
brought
the
child
to
him
on
his
coming
home
he
invented
excuses
to
get
her
to
talk
for
a
few
moments
unfortunately
totty
appeared
little
disposed
to
talk
luke
ackroyd
was
not
infrequently
in
bunce
room
these
two
discussed
religion
and
politics
together
and
their
remarks
on
these
subjects
lacked
neither
vigour
nor
perspicuity
ye
gods
how
they
went
to
the
root
of
things
ackroyd
had
persevered
in
his
pronounced
antinomianism
he
did
not
take
life
as
as
his
companion
and
consequently
was
not
as
sincere
in
his
revolt
but
he
represented
very
fairly
the
modern
type
of
workman
who
is
from
birth
at
issue
with
the
lingering
old
world
that
is
he
represented
it
intellectually
there
was
however
much
in
his
character
which
does
not
mark
the
proletarian
as
such
essentially
his
nature
was
very
gentle
and
ductile
and
he
had
strong
affections
probably
he
could
not
have
told
you
with
any
approach
to
accuracy
how
often
he
had
been
in
love
or
fancied
himself
so
and
for
ackroyd
being
in
love
was
to
tell
the
truth
a
matter
of
vastly
more
importance
than
all
the
political
and
social
and
religious
questions
in
the
world
he
and
totty
were
still
on
the
terms
of
that
compact
which
had
christmas
in
view
his
own
part
was
discharged
conscientiously
he
visited
no
and
was
steady
at
his
work
in
fact
he
had
never
had
those
tastes
which
bring
a
man
to
hopeless
sottishness
more
than
half
his
dissipation
had
come
of
that
kind
of
vanity
whereof
young
gentlemen
of
the
best
families
have
by
no
means
the
monopoly
he
liked
people
to
talk
about
him
he
liked
to
know
that
it
was
deemed
a
pity
for
such
a
clever
young
fellow
to
go
to
the
dogs
even
in
his
recklessness
after
the
loss
of
thyrza
there
was
much
of
this
element
disappointment
in
love
is
known
to
make
one
interesting
and
if
luke
could
have
brought
on
a
mild
fever
so
that
people
could
say
he
was
in
danger
of
dying
it
would
probably
not
have
displeased
him
that
was
over
now
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
was
in
love
with
totty
and
he
told
himself
daily
how
glad
he
was
in
the
thought
of
marrying
her
shortly
after
christmas
for
all
that
they
quarrelled
he
and
she
it
would
not
be
easy
to
say
how
many
times
they
quarrelled
and
made
it
up
again
during
the
latter
half
of
the
year
there
was
a
certain
unlikeness
of
temperament
which
perpetually
made
them
think
more
of
their
difficulties
in
getting
on
together
than
of
the
pleasure
they
received
from
each
other
society
ackroyd
frequently
pondered
on
the
question
of
how
this
matter
would
arrange
itself
after
they
were
married
at
times
he
was
secretly
not
a
little
alarmed
as
his
wont
was
he
talked
over
the
question
exhaustively
with
his
sister
poole
the
latter
for
a
time
refused
to
converse
on
the
subject
at
all
she
was
by
no
means
sure
that
miss
nancarrow
was
in
any
sense
a
desirable
acquisition
to
the
family
having
conceived
a
great
prejudice
against
her
from
the
night
when
ackroyd
had
dealings
with
the
police
a
hint
to
this
effect
led
to
a
furious
outbreak
on
luke
part
he
was
insulted
he
would
leave
the
house
and
find
quarters
elsewhere
his
sister
was
a
calumniating
woman
he
was
bidden
to
take
his
departure
as
soon
as
he
liked
but
somehow
he
did
not
do
so
then
poole
got
her
husband
to
make
private
inquiries
about
miss
nancarrow
jim
obeyed
her
and
had
to
confess
that
the
report
was
tolerable
enough
the
girl
was
perhaps
a
little
no
worse
you
always
so
soft
when
there
talk
about
women
exclaimed
his
wife
disappointed
declare
you
as
bad
as
luke
himself
i
shall
see
what
i
can
find
out
for
myself
she
too
found
that
no
evil
report
was
current
about
totty
save
that
she
was
a
roman
catholic
to
be
sure
this
was
bad
enough
but
could
not
perhaps
be
made
a
ground
of
serious
objection
to
the
girl
so
poole
fell
back
on
an
old
line
of
argument
tired
of
hearing
about
your
girls
she
exclaimed
when
luke
next
broached
the
subject
it
ai
one
it
another
you
must
find
somebody
else
to
talk
to
one
thing
i
know
if
i
was
a
girl
i
would
marry
you
no
not
if
you
a
fortune
but
in
the
end
she
yielded
for
she
saw
that
the
matter
was
serious
want
to
bring
totty
here
luke
said
one
night
ca
always
see
her
in
the
street
and
there
no
other
handy
place
what
do
you
say
jane
must
do
as
you
like
there
the
parlour
you
welcome
to
but
you
must
go
bringing
her
down
here
mind
i
an
idea
her
and
me
wo
quite
hit
it
you
welcome
to
the
parlour
further
quarrels
and
reconcilements
led
to
a
modification
of
this
standpoint
poole
at
length
said
that
she
was
willing
to
be
introduced
to
totty
and
sent
an
invitation
to
tea
for
sunday
evening
him
get
married
and
have
done
with
it
she
said
to
her
husband
shall
have
no
peace
till
he
does
he
worrits
my
life
out
worrit
you
a
good
deal
more
afterwards
if
i
not
mistook
remarked
jim
with
a
dry
chuckle
but
an
unforeseen
difficulty
presented
itself
totty
positively
declined
to
visit
poole
at
present
there
was
plenty
of
time
for
that
she
said
wait
till
christmas
was
nearer
so
ackroyd
and
totty
once
more
fell
out
and
this
time
very
gravely
for
a
fortnight
they
did
not
see
each
other
and
even
when
the
inevitable
renewal
of
kindness
came
about
totty
made
it
a
condition
that
she
must
not
be
asked
to
visit
poole
time
enough
for
that
poole
was
of
course
offended
it
took
her
longer
than
a
fortnight
before
she
could
hear
any
reference
to
totty
early
in
december
totty
had
a
bit
of
news
to
impart
which
gave
ackroyd
a
good
deal
of
anxiety
she
had
been
talking
with
bower
and
that
lady
had
as
good
as
said
that
she
could
no
longer
keep
old
boddy
in
her
house
three
weeks
behind
with
his
rent
totty
said
he
sold
everything
he
had
to
sell
except
his
fiddle
to
pay
even
so
long
do
you
think
lydia
trent
knows
that
ca
say
i
should
think
most
likely
she
does
she
nothing
to
do
with
none
of
the
bowers
and
has
had
for
a
long
time
and
you
may
be
quite
sure
boddy
would
be
the
first
to
tell
her
how
things
was
thyrza
often
said
what
work
they
had
to
get
him
to
take
anything
from
them
got
no
work
then
a
shilling
now
and
then
bower
says
he
getting
too
slow
for
the
people
as
employed
him
i
should
wonder
if
he
as
good
as
starved
most
days
brutes
those
bowers
are
and
now
i
suppose
they
going
to
turn
the
old
man
into
the
street
that
the
christianity
that
their
girl
has
taught
them
i
tell
you
what
i
see
if
i
ca
find
a
bit
of
something
for
him
to
do
but
then
what
the
good
it
only
keep
him
a
day
or
two
lydia
have
to
be
told
about
it
all
very
well
remarked
totty
i
do
see
how
she
to
keep
him
besides
i
think
she
might
have
found
out
for
herself
how
things
was
going
before
now
may
depend
upon
it
it
only
because
the
old
man
hidden
it
from
her
so
that
she
could
have
an
idea
i
do
like
to
hear
you
speak
like
that
of
lydia
totty
do
see
that
there
any
harm
in
what
i
said
i
know
you
did
mean
it
to
be
unkind
but
it
sounded
so
always
very
sharp
about
lydia
know
i
am
she
a
good
girl
and
she
a
great
deal
to
bear
i
think
everybody
ought
to
respect
her
it
was
perilously
near
a
misunderstanding
but
totty
was
not
altogether
in
earnest
and
had
good
sense
enough
to
refrain
from
unworthy
suggestions
on
such
a
subject
ackroyd
had
sometimes
half
suspected
that
she
quarrelled
on
trivial
grounds
of
set
purpose
for
he
was
well
aware
of
her
native
sincerity
and
honest
plainness
of
dealing
her
bad
news
was
unfortunately
true
enough
for
half
a
year
boddy
had
been
breaking
up
the
process
began
very
suddenly
and
was
all
the
harder
to
bear
under
any
circumstances
he
could
not
have
held
his
own
in
the
battle
with
society
much
longer
the
battle
for
the
day
food
of
which
society
does
its
best
to
rob
each
individual
and
the
catastrophe
in
the
home
of
the
girls
who
were
dear
to
him
as
though
they
had
been
his
own
children
sounded
the
note
of
retreat
thyrza
was
not
so
much
to
him
as
lydia
but
still
was
very
much
and
the
sorrow
which
darkened
lydia
life
was
to
him
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
all
things
yes
he
hid
the
state
of
things
very
skilfully
from
lydia
eyes
he
told
her
that
he
was
working
when
he
had
no
work
to
do
he
laughed
at
her
questions
as
to
whether
he
had
comfortable
meals
when
he
had
had
no
meal
at
all
the
bowers
never
invited
him
to
come
to
the
parlour
now
and
sit
at
their
table
they
were
so
indifferent
about
him
so
long
as
he
paid
his
rent
that
for
a
long
time
they
did
not
know
how
hard
beset
he
was
lydia
had
ventured
to
ask
him
if
he
would
change
his
lodgings
provided
she
found
him
a
room
in
a
house
where
she
could
visit
him
without
unpleasantness
but
the
old
man
avoided
her
request
if
he
moved
all
sorts
of
things
would
become
known
to
lydia
which
at
present
he
was
able
to
conceal
one
thing
he
could
not
hide
his
hand
had
become
so
unsteady
that
the
bow
would
no
longer
strike
true
notes
from
the
violin
so
he
ceased
to
play
to
the
girl
when
she
came
lydia
did
not
press
him
thinking
that
probably
it
was
too
painful
for
him
to
revive
memories
of
the
old
days
when
hardships
thickened
he
would
have
sold
the
instrument
in
spite
of
every
pang
but
for
the
certainty
that
lydia
would
miss
it
from
his
room
he
lived
more
and
more
to
himself
till
the
beginning
of
november
he
was
able
just
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
after
paying
his
rent
then
the
rent
was
no
longer
forthcoming
not
one
article
remained
to
him
for
which
he
could
obtain
money
not
one
save
the
violin
he
durst
not
sell
it
in
spite
of
everything
he
clung
to
a
vague
hope
that
someone
would
find
work
for
him
to
ackroyd
he
could
not
go
that
would
be
the
same
as
telling
lydia
for
he
could
trust
no
one
in
the
state
of
mind
which
he
had
reached
even
to
strangers
he
was
afraid
to
appeal
with
overmuch
earnestness
lest
stories
should
get
about
still
an
odd
shilling
came
to
him
now
and
then
poor
old
fellow
he
did
sad
things
one
morning
he
took
the
old
which
he
had
used
for
years
for
his
one
boot
and
a
little
pot
of
blacking
and
an
old
box
and
walked
far
away
across
the
river
to
a
place
where
no
one
could
know
him
and
there
tried
to
earn
a
little
by
rivalling
with
the
shoeblacks
it
was
useless
in
three
days
he
had
earned
but
as
many
pence
he
could
not
waste
time
thus
it
was
a
terrible
moment
when
he
had
first
to
tell
bower
that
he
could
not
discharge
his
due
to
her
he
tried
to
put
on
a
air
to
make
out
that
his
difficulty
was
of
the
most
passing
kind
bower
ungraciously
bade
him
not
to
trouble
himself
to
pay
as
soon
as
he
could
but
when
the
second
day
of
default
came
the
landlady
was
even
less
gracious
ai
an
unreasonable
woman
boddy
she
said
nobody
could
never
say
i
was
but
then
i
a
to
keep
up
as
you
know
is
it
time
as
you
thought
things
over
a
bit
i
dessay
there
them
as
see
you
do
want
if
only
you
speak
a
word
i
do
want
to
be
disagreeable
to
a
old
lodger
but
then
reason
reason
ai
it
that
saturday
night
hunger
drove
him
out
he
stumped
painfully
into
the
busy
region
on
the
south
side
of
london
bridge
and
there
at
midnight
he
succeeded
in
begging
a
handful
of
fried
potatoes
from
a
that
was
just
closing
it
was
all
he
could
do
after
a
dozen
vain
efforts
to
earn
a
copper
but
when
he
got
home
in
the
early
morning
a
strange
thing
had
happened
on
his
table
lay
half
a
loaf
of
bread
a
piece
of
butter
and
some
tea
twisted
up
in
paper
how
came
these
things
here
he
was
in
anguish
lest
lydia
had
left
them
lest
lydia
had
somehow
discovered
his
condition
and
had
come
in
his
absence
but
it
was
not
so
lydia
came
as
usual
on
sunday
afternoon
and
clearly
knew
nothing
of
that
gift
he
had
eaten
and
was
able
once
more
to
talk
so
cheerfully
in
his
great
relief
that
the
girl
went
away
happy
in
the
thought
that
he
had
got
over
a
turn
of
they
had
talked
as
always
of
thyrza
with
thyrza
it
was
well
outwardly
at
all
events
lydia
had
just
seen
her
and
could
report
that
she
seemed
even
happy
boddy
rejoiced
at
this
might
not
see
the
little
one
some
day
yes
surely
he
should
lydia
would
try
for
that
who
had
left
him
the
food
then
no
one
entered
his
room
to
do
anything
for
him
save
at
intervals
of
a
fortnight
when
bower
sent
up
a
charwoman
otherwise
he
had
always
waited
upon
himself
two
days
went
by
then
the
offering
was
renewed
just
in
the
same
way
and
this
time
with
the
addition
of
some
sugar
the
giver
could
be
but
one
person
mary
bower
knew
of
his
need
and
was
doing
what
she
could
for
him
he
knew
it
in
meeting
her
on
the
stairs
the
morning
after
she
said
a
kind
and
reddened
and
went
by
with
her
head
bent
but
it
was
bitter
to
receive
such
help
he
could
not
refuse
it
for
otherwise
he
must
have
lain
down
in
helplessness
and
he
trusted
yet
that
there
would
come
a
turn
in
things
the
winter
cold
began
bower
had
not
refused
coals
he
always
burned
so
little
that
fuel
was
allowed
to
be
covered
by
the
rent
but
now
he
scarcely
ventured
to
keep
his
fire
alight
long
enough
to
boil
his
kettle
he
still
had
a
little
supply
for
burning
and
felt
that
he
durst
not
go
down
to
the
cellar
for
more
when
that
was
done
then
came
the
day
when
his
landlady
told
him
with
decisive
brevity
that
she
could
trust
him
no
longer
he
must
not
be
a
foolish
old
man
but
must
ask
help
from
those
whose
duty
it
was
to
give
it
him
that
was
in
the
afternoon
bower
had
come
up
to
his
room
and
had
asked
for
the
rent
he
waited
until
it
was
dark
then
stole
out
of
the
house
carrying
his
violin
he
would
not
sell
it
only
borrow
a
sum
at
the
then
he
could
some
day
recover
the
instrument
nor
must
he
go
to
a
in
this
neighbourhood
whence
tales
would
spread
he
stumped
over
into
southwark
and
found
a
quiet
street
where
the
three
brass
halls
hung
above
an
illuminated
shop
front
the
entrance
to
the
pawning
department
was
beneath
a
dark
archway
at
the
door
he
stopped
there
was
a
great
lump
in
his
throat
and
suddenly
with
great
physical
anguish
tears
broke
from
his
eyes
he
stood
away
from
the
door
until
he
could
master
the
flow
of
tears
then
he
went
in
carefully
selected
a
box
which
was
empty
and
pledged
the
violin
for
ten
shillings
the
man
refused
to
lend
him
more
and
he
could
not
argue
that
fit
of
weeping
seemed
to
have
affected
him
for
ill
going
forth
again
into
the
cold
he
trembled
violently
and
by
no
effort
could
recover
himself
he
had
to
sit
down
upon
a
the
chillness
of
his
blood
which
yet
beat
feverishly
at
his
temples
affected
him
with
a
dread
lest
he
should
not
have
strength
to
reach
home
his
thoughts
would
not
obey
his
will
again
and
again
he
fell
into
torment
of
apprehension
asking
himself
how
to
find
money
for
the
rent
that
was
due
and
only
with
a
painful
effort
of
mind
remembering
the
ten
shillings
in
his
pocket
the
door
beneath
which
he
was
sitting
suddenly
opened
he
staggered
up
and
onwards
but
the
cold
and
the
weakness
and
the
anguish
of
dread
grew
upon
him
he
could
not
remember
the
streets
by
which
he
had
come
he
stumped
on
fancying
that
he
recognised
this
and
that
object
and
at
length
knew
that
he
had
reached
westminster
bridge
road
the
joy
of
drawing
near
home
supported
him
he
had
only
to
go
the
length
of
hercules
buildings
and
then
he
would
be
close
to
the
end
of
paradise
street
he
reached
the
walking
for
the
most
part
as
in
a
terrible
dream
among
strange
distorted
shapes
of
men
and
women
the
houses
tottering
black
on
either
hand
and
ever
that
of
the
blood
at
his
temples
then
of
a
sudden
his
wooden
limb
slipped
and
he
fell
to
the
ground
he
was
precisely
in
front
of
the
pooles
house
a
woman
just
passing
who
happened
to
know
poole
ran
up
to
the
door
and
knocked
and
when
poole
came
asked
for
some
water
to
throw
over
a
poor
old
man
who
was
in
a
fit
on
the
pavement
jane
going
in
for
the
water
spoke
to
her
brother
who
was
sitting
in
the
kitchen
ackroyd
went
forth
to
see
what
could
be
done
it
boddy
he
exclaimed
must
carry
him
in
jane
go
and
tell
jim
to
come
here
of
course
a
crowd
had
already
collected
dark
as
the
street
was
we
better
take
him
over
to
the
bowers
asked
jim
it
old
mr
boddy
cried
a
voice
lives
at
mrs
bower
know
that
very
well
said
ackroyd
it
no
good
taking
him
there
lend
a
hand
jim
see
he
coming
round
a
bit
and
he
added
muttering
expect
he
starved
to
death
that
about
it
only
the
night
before
totty
had
told
him
of
the
old
man
position
and
he
had
been
casting
about
for
a
way
of
giving
help
he
did
not
like
to
tell
lydia
what
was
going
on
yet
the
inquiries
he
had
made
of
the
men
who
occasionally
employed
boddy
convinced
him
that
there
was
no
hope
of
the
latter
continuing
to
support
himself
in
his
present
state
the
old
man
must
at
least
have
friends
about
him
and
not
pinchers
and
parers
who
had
come
to
dislike
him
because
of
his
relation
to
the
trent
girls
with
characteristic
impulsiveness
luke
made
up
his
mind
that
boddy
should
be
brought
into
the
house
and
kept
there
if
need
be
he
would
provide
for
him
out
of
his
own
pocket
poole
was
no
grumbler
when
a
needed
her
kindness
in
a
moment
a
match
was
put
to
the
fire
in
the
parlour
thither
jim
and
ackroyd
bore
the
old
man
and
laid
him
upon
the
couch
he
did
not
seem
wholly
unconscious
for
his
eyes
regarded
first
one
then
the
other
of
those
who
were
ministering
to
him
but
he
made
no
effort
to
speak
spoken
to
he
gave
no
sign
of
understanding
it
was
found
that
there
was
blood
upon
his
head
he
must
have
injured
himself
in
falling
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
attempts
at
restoring
him
were
vain
then
luke
said
shall
have
to
run
round
for
the
doctor
for
all
we
know
he
may
be
dying
for
want
of
the
proper
things
go
lad
assented
jim
do
like
the
look
of
his
face
do
you
jane
husband
and
wife
whispered
together
during
luke
absence
they
knew
from
the
latter
into
what
a
miserable
state
the
old
man
had
sunk
and
jane
was
vigorous
in
reprobation
of
the
bowers
ackroyd
returned
saying
that
the
doctor
would
be
at
hand
in
a
minute
or
two
you
to
go
and
tell
miss
trent
jane
asked
him
as
all
three
stood
helpless
waiting
thought
of
it
but
i
rather
not
if
it
can
be
helped
wait
till
the
doctor
comes
the
old
man
lay
quite
still
breathing
heavily
his
eyes
were
yet
open
but
had
fixed
themselves
in
one
direction
the
doctor
came
he
directed
that
the
sufferer
should
at
once
be
put
into
a
warm
bed
room
then
said
luke
and
help
jim
the
directions
were
soon
carried
out
and
the
doctor
went
off
asking
someone
to
follow
for
medicine
the
wound
proved
to
be
of
no
moment
graver
causes
must
have
led
to
the
state
of
coma
in
which
the
old
man
lay
when
luke
returned
from
the
doctor
he
reported
that
the
latter
had
spoken
rather
seriously
must
go
and
see
lydia
he
said
to
his
sister
do
mind
this
bother
jane
eh
you
sit
by
him
course
i
will
go
and
fetch
her
it
my
belief
he
has
very
long
to
live
it
seemed
to
ackroyd
a
long
time
since
he
had
knocked
at
the
door
in
walnut
tree
walk
very
much
had
come
about
since
then
impatient
he
had
to
repeat
his
knock
before
any
one
came
then
jarmey
appeared
no
he
knew
miss
trent
was
not
in
she
had
gone
out
with
his
wife
half
an
hour
ago
but
it
was
getting
late
and
they
were
sure
to
be
soon
back
grail
in
think
so
i
just
knock
and
see
gilbert
was
at
home
and
ackroyd
went
into
the
parlour
the
two
were
very
friendly
whenever
they
met
but
that
was
seldom
grail
was
surprised
at
the
visit
he
was
sitting
with
his
mother
they
seemed
to
have
been
talking
for
no
book
lay
on
the
table
luke
explained
why
he
had
come
to
the
house
you
let
me
sit
here
till
she
comes
in
grail
a
chair
was
at
once
brought
forward
with
quiet
readiness
one
chair
there
was
in
the
room
which
no
one
ever
used
though
at
evening
it
was
always
put
in
a
particular
position
between
the
table
and
the
fireplace
gilbert
kept
his
hand
on
the
back
of
it
as
he
talked
ackroyd
railed
against
the
bowers
gilbert
did
not
seem
able
to
express
very
strong
feeling
even
when
he
had
heard
all
that
the
other
knew
and
suspected
his
brows
darkened
however
and
he
was
anxious
on
account
an
oppressive
silence
had
fallen
upon
the
three
when
at
length
they
heard
the
open
you
like
mother
to
go
upstairs
to
her
and
tell
her
gilbert
asked
should
it
would
be
kind
of
you
grail
but
only
just
speak
as
if
it
was
an
accident
i
would
say
anything
else
grail
left
the
room
without
speaking
she
returned
in
a
few
minutes
and
leaving
the
door
a
little
open
said
in
her
very
low
tremulous
voice
that
lydia
was
waiting
in
the
passage
ackroyd
shook
hands
with
the
two
and
went
out
lydia
looked
eagerly
into
his
face
he
very
bad
mr
ackroyd
she
whispered
hope
he
come
round
by
this
time
was
his
reply
attending
to
him
and
we
got
things
for
him
from
the
doctor
they
passed
into
the
street
and
walked
quickly
side
by
side
was
very
good
of
you
to
take
him
in
lydia
said
would
have
been
very
hard
to
ask
bower
for
help
yes
we
do
want
them
lydia
and
poole
had
never
met
they
looked
with
interest
at
each
other
ackroyd
went
down
into
the
kitchen
leaving
them
together
in
the
room
with
the
old
man
the
night
went
on
ackroyd
and
his
smoked
innumerable
pipes
by
the
kitchen
fire
jim
often
nodded
but
luke
was
far
from
sleep
the
sad
still
spent
with
the
grails
had
troubled
his
imagination
and
thoughts
of
thyrza
had
been
revived
in
him
yes
he
had
loved
thyrza
all
folly
put
aside
he
knew
that
the
memory
of
the
girl
would
for
ever
remain
with
him
and
all
this
night
he
did
not
once
think
of
totty
nancarrow
fortunately
as
it
was
saturday
they
had
no
need
to
think
of
work
next
morning
jim
would
not
go
to
bed
he
kept
up
the
most
determined
struggle
with
sleep
subduer
of
mortals
his
wife
came
down
now
and
then
and
was
angry
with
him
for
his
useless
obstinacy
so
plain
it
was
that
he
could
scarcely
hold
up
his
great
thick
head
there
was
nothing
good
to
report
of
the
patient
he
had
not
recovered
consciousness
at
five
when
in
spite
of
fire
and
lamp
the
little
kitchen
looked
haggard
poole
entered
hurriedly
you
think
the
doctor
come
luke
if
you
went
for
him
he
get
breath
lydia
does
want
the
doctor
fetching
luke
was
off
in
an
instant
lydia
stood
by
the
bed
pale
anguished
happily
that
struggle
which
seemed
of
death
did
not
last
very
long
the
worn
old
face
almost
venerable
at
length
in
spite
of
the
grotesqueness
of
its
features
fell
into
calm
then
almost
as
in
a
natural
waking
from
sleep
the
eyes
opened
and
were
aware
of
things
you
feeling
better
grandad
dear
lydia
asked
he
looked
surprised
tried
to
speak
but
there
was
no
voice
luke
was
long
the
two
women
stood
side
by
side
the
old
man
kept
endeavouring
to
utter
words
his
powerlessness
was
dreadful
to
him
his
face
showed
but
at
length
he
spoke
thyrza
shall
come
and
see
you
grandad
she
shall
come
very
soon
again
a
vain
endeavour
to
speak
his
face
altered
it
expressed
lydia
knew
not
what
a
supreme
effort
and
he
again
spoke
bower
gave
me
all
i
wanted
be
friends
with
her
lyddy
no
more
than
that
gradually
an
end
of
struggle
an
end
of
pain
an
end
of
all
things
the
doctor
came
he
said
that
no
doubt
there
would
have
to
be
an
inquest
they
left
lydia
alone
in
the
room
when
it
was
midway
through
the
winter
morning
poole
came
down
and
told
luke
that
the
girl
wished
to
speak
to
him
he
would
find
her
in
the
parlour
she
had
swollen
eyes
but
spoke
with
perfect
calmness
ackroyd
what
did
he
mean
the
last
thing
he
said
was
bower
gave
me
all
i
wanted
i
do
know
what
he
meant
your
sister
says
you
tell
me
luke
could
only
guess
at
the
sense
of
the
words
but
he
told
her
all
he
knew
only
heard
it
on
friday
night
from
totty
he
said
was
thinking
of
every
way
i
could
to
help
him
but
to
think
that
you
never
told
me
she
exclaimed
no
right
to
keep
such
a
thing
from
me
it
was
kindness
it
kindness
at
all
see
what
come
of
it
do
wish
i
had
told
you
early
in
the
afternoon
lydia
went
home
but
before
leaving
she
searched
in
the
poor
old
garments
to
see
if
indeed
he
had
been
penniless
the
discovery
of
the
money
at
first
astonished
her
but
immediately
after
she
found
the
pawn
ticket
it
was
proof
enough
she
was
sitting
in
her
room
at
nightfall
when
someone
knocked
she
went
to
the
door
mary
bower
was
there
i
come
in
lydia
mary
asked
with
eyes
downcast
lydia
had
started
she
drew
back
leaving
the
door
open
mary
entered
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
stood
in
agitation
know
you
hate
me
more
than
ever
lydia
she
began
tremulously
i
did
what
i
could
for
him
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
did
what
i
could
for
him
and
i
never
have
let
mother
give
him
notice
i
told
her
last
night
that
if
she
did
i
leave
home
i
put
food
in
his
room
and
nobody
knew
about
it
perhaps
you
do
believe
me
if
he
could
speak
he
tell
you
someone
did
and
it
was
me
lydia
covered
her
face
and
wept
mary
drawing
nearer
went
on
with
broken
voice
been
very
much
to
blame
lydia
i
been
hard
and
unforgiving
but
that
night
when
you
told
me
you
hated
me
i
wanted
to
say
how
sorry
i
was
for
you
i
never
spoke
a
word
against
thyrza
not
a
word
and
now
i
could
help
coming
to
you
i
want
to
be
friends
again
lyddy
dear
do
send
me
away
i
been
to
blame
in
everything
i
been
you
might
well
not
believe
my
religion
when
you
saw
me
acting
as
i
did
she
ceased
drawn
to
lydia
heart
and
kissed
with
more
than
the
old
affection
know
what
you
did
for
him
mary
he
told
me
the
last
words
he
spoke
he
asked
me
to
be
friends
with
you
again
i
do
want
a
friend
mary
i
very
lonely
i
love
you
as
long
as
i
live
for
being
kind
to
him
they
lit
no
light
but
sat
together
by
the
glow
of
the
fire
speaking
in
very
low
voices
often
with
long
intervals
of
silence
two
poor
girls
the
one
as
ignorant
as
the
other
but
speaking
with
awed
spirit
of
death
and
the
hope
that

chapter
xxxii
totty
luck
little
shop
with
the
large
heart
had
suffered
a
grave
loss
miss
totty
nancarrow
had
withdrawn
her
custom
from
it
totty
had
patronised
bower
very
steadily
for
some
five
years
it
was
true
that
the
shop
put
a
rather
large
price
on
certain
things
in
comparison
with
what
they
be
bought
for
in
lambeth
if
you
wanted
a
pot
of
marmalade
for
instance
bower
sold
it
for
sixpence
whereas
it
was
notoriously
purchasable
for
at
grocers
in
lambeth
walk
if
you
went
for
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
butter
you
had
no
choice
of
quality
and
paid
fourpence
three
farthings
whilst
in
lambeth
walk
you
obtained
a
better
article
for
the
even
fourpence
totty
however
had
a
principle
that
one
ought
to
deal
rather
with
acquaintances
than
with
strangers
and
another
principle
that
it
was
better
to
pay
a
halfpenny
more
for
an
article
to
be
had
by
crossing
the
street
than
a
halfpenny
less
and
go
a
whole
street
length
for
it
true
girl
of
the
people
was
totty
herein
as
in
other
respects
it
was
a
simple
fact
that
bower
business
depended
on
the
indolence
and
indifference
to
small
economies
of
those
women
who
lived
in
her
immediate
neighbourhood
it
is
the
same
kind
of
thing
that
leads
working
people
to
pay
for
having
meat
badly
cooked
at
the
baker
instead
of
cooking
it
cheaply
and
well
themselves
that
leads
them
to
buy
expensive
suppers
at
the
pork
butcher
and
the
shop
instead
of
tossing
up
an
equally
good
and
very
cheap
supper
for
themselves
considering
her
income
totty
had
spent
a
great
deal
with
bower
as
you
remember
that
lady
once
remarking
totty
had
a
mind
to
live
on
luxuries
if
she
had
not
money
enough
for
both
bread
and
marmalade
she
chose
to
have
the
marmalade
alone
if
she
could
not
buy
meat
and
pickles
at
the
same
time
she
would
have
pickles
and
go
without
meat
marmalade
and
pickles
she
deemed
the
indispensables
of
life
if
you
could
not
get
those
well
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
poor
creatures
to
be
driven
to
the
workhouse
and
the
strange
thing
was
that
she
looked
so
well
on
such
diet
since
the
age
of
fifteen
when
in
truth
she
had
been
a
little
peaked
and
terribly
tenuous
at
the
waist
her
personal
appearance
had
steadily
improved
her
spirits
had
by
degrees
reached
their
present
point
of
perpetual
effervescence
but
totty
could
be
grave
and
if
occasion
were
sad
she
had
been
both
grave
and
sad
many
a
time
since
thyrza
had
gone
away
she
reproached
herself
in
secret
for
her
to
the
little
one
at
their
last
meeting
nastiness
for
which
as
it
proved
there
was
no
justification
whatever
now
she
was
sad
for
poor
old
boddy
death
she
knew
that
it
was
another
hard
blow
to
lydia
and
as
you
are
aware
in
her
heart
she
respected
lydia
profoundly
her
sorrow
led
to
that
one
practical
result
no
more
marmalade
and
pickles
from
bower
the
bowers
had
behaved
vilely
from
every
point
of
view
that
was
demonstrable
under
the
circumstances
they
ought
to
have
done
without
their
rent
if
need
were
till
doomsday
when
as
totty
understood
all
such
arrears
are
made
good
to
one
with
the
utmost
accuracy
nay
with
interest
to
boot
she
had
not
seen
any
reason
for
quarrelling
with
the
bowers
on
the
score
of
the
scandal
they
spread
about
thyrza
since
there
really
seemed
ground
for
their
stories
and
it
was
right
that
on
of
that
kind
should
be
put
a
stop
to
totty
would
always
that
is
as
often
as
she
could
be
scrupulously
just
but
this
last
affair
was
beyond
endurance
not
another
penny
went
from
her
pocket
to
little
shop
with
the
large
heart
her
income
this
past
year
had
fallen
short
of
what
she
usually
counted
upon
not
to
a
great
extent
but
the
sum
deducted
had
been
wont
to
come
to
her
as
a
pure
grace
and
she
felt
the
loss
of
it
her
uncle
had
omitted
to
send
his
usual
present
on
her
birthday
nor
had
he
visited
her
to
renew
the
proposal
that
she
should
surrender
her
liberty
in
return
for
being
housed
and
dressed
respectably
what
did
this
mean
had
he
it
was
probable
enough
grown
tired
of
her
and
said
to
himself
that
as
she
wished
to
go
her
own
way
go
her
own
way
she
should
he
was
a
crusty
old
fellow
totty
had
often
wondered
that
he
her
cheek
so
yet
somehow
she
did
not
think
it
likely
that
he
would
break
off
intercourse
with
her
in
this
abrupt
way
no
it
was
not
like
him
he
would
have
at
all
events
seen
her
for
a
last
time
and
have
given
her
a
last
chance
was
he
dead
possible
enough
his
age
must
be
nearer
seventy
than
sixty
if
dead
well
there
was
an
end
of
it
no
more
birthday
presents
no
more
offers
to
made
a
lady
of
it
did
not
greatly
matter
of
course
totty
could
not
be
expected
to
nurture
an
affection
for
her
crusty
uncle
with
his
shop
in
tottenham
court
road
in
fact
he
had
behaved
badly
to
her
branch
of
the
family
and
such
behaviour
can
not
always
be
made
up
for
as
to
the
offer
she
had
declined
it
in
perfect
good
faith
yes
she
preferred
her
liberty
her
innocent
nights
at
the
canterbury
music
hall
her
scampering
about
the
streets
at
all
hours
her
marmalade
and
pickles
eaten
off
a
table
covered
with
a
newspaper
in
company
with
half
a
dozen
friends
as
as
herself
deliberately
she
preferred
these
joys
to
anything
she
could
imagine
as
entering
into
the
life
of
a
however
it
was
a
fact
that
christmas
was
very
near
also
a
fact
that
she
stood
pledged
to
marry
luke
ackroyd
any
day
after
christmas
that
he
chose
to
claim
her
she
was
a
little
sorry
that
she
could
not
inform
her
uncle
in
tottenham
court
road
of
the
change
she
was
about
to
make
in
her
life
there
was
no
knowing
how
he
might
have
behaved
on
such
an
occasion
luke
had
been
saving
a
little
money
of
late
but
it
was
naturally
a
very
little
he
foolish
fellow
had
a
way
of
buying
her
things
which
she
did
not
in
the
least
want
but
which
she
could
not
refuse
since
it
gave
him
such
enormous
pleasure
to
offer
them
luke
was
very
generous
whatever
his
faults
might
be
certain
presents
of
his
she
had
returned
to
him
in
wrath
probably
once
a
fortnight
and
when
in
the
course
of
things
she
had
to
take
them
back
again
some
object
was
always
added
the
presents
cost
little
it
is
true
totty
did
not
ask
the
price
of
them
but
liked
the
kindness
which
suggested
their
purchase
she
liked
many
things
about
luke
ackroyd
whether
she
really
liked
him
himself
liked
him
in
proper
way
well
that
was
a
question
she
asked
herself
often
enough
without
any
very
definite
answer
no
matter
she
had
promised
to
marry
him
and
she
was
not
the
girl
to
break
her
word
now
if
her
uncle
had
still
been
in
communication
with
her
was
it
not
a
very
likely
thing
that
he
would
have
felt
a
desire
to
in
fact
to
do
something
for
them
it
was
not
nice
to
begin
married
life
in
furnished
lodgings
especially
if
prudence
dictated
the
living
in
a
single
room
as
such
numbers
of
her
acquaintances
did
totty
had
discovered
that
couples
who
wedded
and
went
to
live
in
one
furnished
room
seldom
got
along
well
together
it
was
well
if
the
wife
did
not
shortly
go
about
with
bruises
on
her
face
or
with
her
arm
in
a
sling
no
to
be
sure
luke
ackroyd
was
not
a
man
of
that
kind
it
was
inconceivable
that
he
should
ever
be
harsh
to
her
let
alone
brutal
still
it
was
nice
to
begin
in
furnished
lodgings
and
perhaps
her
uncle
in
tottenham
court
road
he
was
in
fact
a
furniture
dealer
would
have
seen
his
way
to
garnish
for
them
a
modest
couple
of
rooms
by
way
of
wedding
present
but
he
having
drawn
back
from
communication
totty
could
not
bring
herself
to
his
notice
again
not
she
she
was
thinking
over
all
these
things
a
week
before
christmas
it
was
sunday
afternoon
and
for
a
wonder
she
was
sitting
alone
in
her
room
bunce
was
at
home
or
she
would
have
had
little
nelly
to
keep
her
company
still
she
said
to
herself
that
she
was
not
sorry
to
have
a
minute
or
two
to
put
certain
things
straight
in
her
mind
what
a
mind
it
was
totty
nancarrow
the
landlady
looked
in
at
the
door
a
gemman
wants
to
see
you
miss
nancarrow
what
sort
of
a
gentleman
oldish
i
dessay
greyish
beard
and
a
big
nose
speaks
very
loud
and
important
like
not
her
uncle
he
had
no
beard
and
a
very
small
nose
and
could
not
thus
have
altered
since
she
last
saw
him
right
i
go
and
ask
him
what
he
wants
totty
gave
a
glance
at
her
six
square
inches
of
made
a
movement
with
her
hand
which
was
like
a
box
on
each
ear
then
went
downstairs
in
her
usual
way
swinging
by
the
banisters
down
three
steps
at
a
time
at
the
door
she
found
a
person
answering
very
fairly
to
the
landlady
graphic
description
the
experienced
eye
would
have
perceived
that
he
was
not
in
the
restricted
sense
of
the
word
a
gentleman
still
he
wore
good
clothing
and
had
of
a
truth
an
important
air
want
me
sir
totty
asked
coming
to
a
sudden
stand
in
front
of
him
and
examining
him
with
steady
eye
he
returned
the
gaze
with
equal
steadiness
both
hands
rested
on
the
top
of
his
umbrella
and
his
attitude
was
very
much
that
of
a
man
who
views
a
horse
he
has
thoughts
of
purchasing
are
miss
nancarrow
i
think
he
said
clearing
his
throat
name
totty
me
i
believe
i
should
like
to
have
a
word
with
you
miss
nancarrow
if
you
will
allow
me
ca
say
it
here
sir
no
i
ca
if
you
could
totty
did
not
wait
for
him
to
finish
but
ran
away
to
get
permission
to
use
the
landlady
parlour
to
this
she
introduced
her
visitor
who
seated
himself
without
invitation
and
after
gazing
about
the
room
said
sit
down
miss
nancarrow
i
come
to
see
you
on
a
matter
of
some
importance
i
am
barlow
an
old
friend
of
your
uncle
you
have
possibly
heard
of
me
i
have
totty
replied
as
she
spoke
it
struck
her
that
there
was
a
broad
black
band
round
barlow
shiny
hat
you
have
jusso
barlow
again
cleared
his
throat
looking
about
the
floor
as
if
he
were
in
the
habit
of
living
near
a
spittoon
and
then
he
paused
a
little
elevating
and
sinking
his
bushy
eyebrows
totty
who
had
taken
the
edge
of
a
chair
moved
her
feet
impatiently
miss
totty
nancarrow
resumed
her
visitor
using
his
umbrella
to
prop
his
chin
and
rolling
out
his
words
with
evident
enjoyment
of
his
task
have
the
unpleasant
duty
of
informing
you
that
your
late
uncle
is
dead
the
phrase
might
have
excited
a
smile
totty
kept
an
even
countenance
and
said
she
was
sorry
to
hear
it
he
has
been
dead
nearly
a
month
and
he
was
ill
nearly
six
i
am
appointed
one
of
the
executors
by
his
will
me
and
a
friend
of
mine
higgins
i
dare
say
you
have
heard
of
him
we
been
putting
your
late
uncle
affairs
in
order
you
said
totty
because
she
had
nothing
else
to
say
have
i
have
come
to
see
you
miss
nancarrow
because
you
are
interested
in
the
will
am
i
it
was
said
with
a
kind
of
disinterested
curiosity
barlow
having
regarded
her
fixedly
for
a
moment
bent
his
head
till
his
forehead
rested
upon
the
umbrella
and
seemed
to
brood
you
feel
well
sir
totty
asked
with
a
which
betrayed
her
impatience
well
quite
well
was
saying
something
about
my
uncle
will
your
name
is
in
the
will
miss
nancarrow
your
uncle
has
bequeathed
to
you
the
sum
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
you
brought
it
with
you
sir
will
the
money
dear
miss
nancarrow
things
are
not
done
in
that
way
remarked
barlow
smiling
at
her
ingenuousness
then
sir
are
conditions
attached
to
this
bequest
it
is
my
duty
to
explain
them
to
you
i
shall
avoid
the
terms
of
the
law
out
of
consideration
to
you
miss
nancarrow
and
try
to
express
myself
very
simply
i
hope
you
be
able
to
follow
me
totty
regarded
him
with
wide
eyes
and
smiled
do
my
best
sir
please
listen
he
rested
one
elbow
on
his
umbrella
and
with
the
other
hand
made
demonstrations
in
the
air
as
he
proceeded
throughout
he
spoke
as
one
who
addresses
a
person
partly
imbecile
sum
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
miss
nancarrow
is
not
you
follow
me
is
not
to
be
given
to
you
at
once
you
grasp
that
i
am
trustee
for
the
money
that
means
attend
please
it
lies
in
my
hands
until
the
time
and
the
occasion
comes
for
mind
for
giving
it
to
you
you
understand
so
far
should
mind
a
harder
word
now
and
then
sir
if
it
makes
it
easier
for
you
barlow
examined
her
but
totty
face
was
very
placid
she
cast
down
her
eyes
and
watched
her
toes
tapping
together
well
i
think
you
follow
me
now
the
conditions
are
these
the
money
is
payable
to
you
payable
you
see
on
your
marriage
beg
you
not
to
interrupt
me
is
payable
to
you
on
your
marriage
and
then
now
pray
attend
unless
you
obtain
the
approval
of
myself
and
of
higgins
unless
you
obtain
approval
of
the
man
you
propose
to
marry
have
understood
i
hope
shall
marry
who
i
like
sir
observed
totty
quietly
barlow
looked
at
her
with
surprise
dear
miss
nancarrow
nobody
ever
said
you
should
it
is
a
question
of
your
marrying
but
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
do
see
what
it
got
to
do
with
anybody
who
i
choose
to
marry
jusso
nothing
could
be
truer
it
only
a
question
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
totty
was
about
to
make
another
indignant
remark
but
she
checked
herself
her
toes
were
tapping
together
very
rapidly
she
watched
them
for
half
a
minute
then
asked
suppose
i
do
choose
to
marry
anybody
at
all
see
you
are
capable
of
following
these
things
said
barlow
smiling
you
reach
the
age
of
without
marrying
the
money
goes
to
another
purpose
of
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
speak
i
do
see
why
my
uncle
bothered
himself
so
much
about
me
marrying
doubt
your
late
uncle
had
some
good
reason
for
these
provisions
miss
nancarrow
said
the
other
gravely
should
speak
respectfully
of
those
who
are
no
more
it
seems
to
me
your
late
uncle
took
very
kind
thought
for
you
totty
considered
that
but
neither
assented
nor
differed
you
tell
me
she
asked
after
a
silence
speaking
with
a
good
deal
of
hauteur
sort
of
a
man
you
approve
of
pleasure
miss
nancarrow
with
very
great
pleasure
higgins
and
me
have
thought
over
the
subject
have
given
it
our
best
attention
we
think
that
by
laying
down
three
conditions
we
shall
meet
the
case
he
stared
at
the
ceiling
till
totty
asked
and
what
are
they
sir
do
not
interrupt
me
i
was
about
to
tell
you
first
then
this
man
age
must
be
at
least
you
understand
think
i
do
he
must
have
a
recognised
profession
business
trade
or
handicraft
and
must
satisfy
me
and
higgins
that
he
is
able
to
support
a
wife
then
then
as
you
say
miss
nancarrow
he
must
be
able
to
prove
to
me
and
higgins
that
he
has
lived
in
one
and
the
same
house
for
a
year
previous
to
his
marriage
with
you
barlow
delivered
this
with
slow
emphasis
as
if
such
a
test
of
respectability
were
the
finest
fruit
of
administrative
wisdom
totty
laughed
she
had
expected
something
quite
different
smile
miss
nancarrow
remarked
barlow
with
a
slightly
offended
air
i
was
laughing
at
what
pray
well
i
hope
i
have
made
everything
clear
to
you
the
same
sir
i
shall
marry
whoever
i
like
no
doubt
whatever
you
will
i
shall
leave
you
my
address
miss
nancarrow
so
that
you
can
communicate
with
me
at
any
moment
you
sir
she
took
the
offered
card
and
thrust
it
into
her
pocket
if
i
do
want
to
marry
at
all
i
sha
is
at
your
option
miss
nancarrow
now
i
say
to
you
perhaps
you
allow
me
to
shake
hands
with
you
and
congratulate
you
upon
this
this
little
fortune
yes
totty
gave
barlow
fat
hand
a
jerk
he
drew
himself
up
cleared
his
throat
and
stalked
to
the
door
regarding
with
lofty
patronage
the
signs
of
poverty
about
him
at
the
door
he
took
off
his
hat
bowed
departed
totty
returned
to
her
room
she
resumed
her
former
seat
and
began
to
hum
a
slow
air
then
she
tilted
her
chair
back
against
the
wall
and
turned
her
face
upwards
musing
it
was
not
easy
for
her
to
realise
the
meaning
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
reckon
it
up
for
instance
in
marmalade
and
pickles
it
became
confusing
very
soon
reckon
it
up
in
tables
and
chairs
ah
that
was
more
to
the
point
but
even
then
what
a
stupendous
margin
for
twenty
pounds
you
could
furnish
a
couple
of
rooms
in
a
way
to
make
all
your
neighbours
envious
it
was
like
attempting
to
comprehend
infinity
by
making
clear
to
one
mind
the
distance
to
the
moon
the
three
conditions
luke
ackroyd
could
satisfy
them
all
how
often
he
had
said
that
what
he
wanted
was
a
little
capital
to
establish
a
comfortable
home
of
his
own
when
he
would
feel
settled
for
life
no
thought
now
of
furnished
lodgings
fancy
making
one
husband
a
present
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
much
better
that
than
receiving
presents
oneself
she
was
to
meet
luke
and
it
was
time
that
a
definite
arrangement
was
made
as
to
their
marriage
somehow
totty
did
not
feel
quite
so
joyous
as
she
ought
to
have
done
she
could
not
fix
her
mind
on
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
but
it
wandered
off
to
other
things
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
money
now
she
said
to
herself
at
length
i
care
for
anybody
more
than
for
him
no
quite
certain
i
do
do
i
care
much
for
him
himself
do
i
care
for
him
properly
suddenly
she
thought
of
thyrza
she
remembered
question
you
love
him
totty
no
she
did
not
love
him
she
had
known
it
for
a
good
many
weeks
and
what
was
more
she
had
known
perfectly
well
that
he
did
not
love
her
there
it
was
no
doubt
he
loved
me
i
should
love
him
i
could
i
think
i
could
not
like
thyrza
loved
egremont
to
go
mad
about
him
that
is
my
style
i
would
be
so
foolish
about
man
not
i
but
i
could
be
very
fond
of
him
and
there
no
hiding
it
i
not
i
should
grieve
a
bit
if
we
said
and
never
saw
each
other
again
how
did
she
know
he
did
love
her
if
i
could
tell
just
listen
when
he
speaks
about
thyrza
he
never
speak
about
me
like
that
if
i
ran
away
from
him
and
how
he
speaks
about
lydia
why
even
about
lydia
he
thinks
a
good
deal
more
than
he
does
about
me
he
often
talks
to
me
as
if
i
was
a
man
he
would
if
he
if
he
loved
me
totty
found
it
difficult
to
say
that
word
even
to
herself
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
do
think
as
i
shall
ever
care
proper
for
anybody
i
a
good
mind
not
to
marry
at
all
as
i
always
said
i
would
i
was
right
enough
as
long
as
i
kept
to
that
the
girls
only
make
fun
of
me
yes
but
her
promise
she
began
to
feel
gloomy
perhaps
nightfall
had
something
to
do
with
it
should
she
make
tea
no
she
did
care
for
it
she
would
go
out
somewhere
she
walked
from
newport
street
to
lambeth
road
passed
bethlehem
hospital
bedlam
and
came
to
george
cathedral
it
is
a
long
vast
ugly
building
unfinished
for
it
still
lacks
towers
in
the
dark
it
looked
very
cold
and
forbidding
but
totty
had
a
sense
that
there
was
warmth
within
warmth
and
shelter
of
a
kind
that
she
needed
just
now
she
entered
and
at
the
proper
place
dropped
to
her
knees
and
crossed
herself
then
she
stood
looking
about
near
her
hanging
against
a
pillar
was
a
box
with
the
superscription
the
souls
in
purgatory
she
always
put
a
penny
into
this
box
and
did
so
now
then
she
walked
softly
to
an
image
of
the
virgin
at
whose
feet
someone
had
laid
hothouse
flowers
a
poor
woman
was
kneeling
there
a
woman
in
rags
her
head
was
bent
in
prayer
her
hands
clasped
against
her
breast
totty
knelt
beside
her
bent
her
own
head
and
clasped
her
hands
yes
it
was
good
to
be
here
all
was
very
still
but
few
lights
were
burning
when
totty
needed
a
mother
counsel
a
mother
love
she
was
wont
to
come
here
and
whisper
humble
thoughts
to
the
image
which
looked
down
so
soothingly
upon
all
who
made
appeal
to
totty
her
religion
was
a
purely
private
interest
it
would
never
for
instance
have
occurred
to
her
to
demand
that
her
husband
should
be
a
catholic
not
even
that
he
should
view
her
faith
with
sympathetic
tolerance
no
word
on
this
subject
would
ever
pass
her
lips
what
was
it
to
any
one
else
if
she
had
in
secret
a
mother
to
whom
she
breathed
her
troubles
and
her
difficulties
could
any
one
grudge
her
that
the
consolation
was
too
sacred
to
speak
of
her
thoughts
did
not
rise
to
a
deity
she
thought
but
seldom
of
the
story
which
told
her
that
deity
had
taken
man
form
the
madonna
was
enough
the
mother
whose
gentle
heart
was
full
of
sorrows
and
who
had
power
to
aid
the
sorrowful
the
poor
ragged
woman
sighed
deeply
rose
and
went
forth
with
humble
step
went
forth
to
who
knows
what
miseries
what
cruelties
and
despairs
but
in
her
sigh
there
had
been
consolation
even
so
with
totty
when
at
length
she
left
the
church
her
way
was
by
no
means
clear
of
all
obstacles
but
the
trouble
which
had
come
upon
her
with
unwonted
force
was
much
simplified
it
was
plain
to
her
that
she
give
herself
to
ackroyd
and
that
to
give
him
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
would
be
a
very
substantial
pleasure
growing
accustomed
to
the
thought
of
her
wealth
she
derived
from
it
a
quiet
pride
which
made
her
walk
homewards
more
staidly
than
usual
luke
could
never
forget
that
she
had
been
a
great
help
to
him
she
would
let
him
settle
everything
then
would
tell
him
these
winter
nights
were
troublesome
to
an
unfortunate
pair
who
wished
to
talk
in
a
leisurely
way
together
yet
had
no
shelter
save
that
of
a
place
of
public
entertainment
or
an
archway
under
the
line
and
it
was
particularly
cold
there
had
even
fallen
a
little
snow
totty
and
ackroyd
met
as
usual
at
the
end
of
paradise
street
it
being
sunday
they
could
not
go
to
the
and
it
was
really
impossible
to
stand
about
in
the
open
air
here
totty
said
ackroyd
come
into
the
house
you
need
see
any
one
unless
you
like
we
can
have
the
to
ourselves
the
others
always
sit
downstairs
totty
hesitated
but
at
length
assented
if
the
truth
were
known
her
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
had
probably
something
to
do
with
her
yielding
on
this
point
at
present
she
could
face
poole
on
equal
terms
so
they
entered
the
house
and
luke
having
left
his
companion
in
the
parlour
went
down
to
apprise
his
sister
jane
came
up
and
gave
the
girl
a
civil
greeting
it
was
not
cordial
nor
did
totty
affect
warmth
of
feeling
poole
speedily
left
the
two
to
themselves
totty
sat
in
her
chair
rather
stiffly
she
was
not
accustomed
to
take
her
ease
in
rooms
even
as
well
appointed
as
this
luke
tried
to
be
merry
to
show
that
he
was
delighted
to
be
affectionate
he
did
not
succeed
very
well
presently
they
were
sitting
at
a
little
distance
from
each
other
each
waiting
for
the
other
to
speak
is
it
to
be
ackroyd
said
at
length
bending
forward
do
know
is
it
to
be
not
of
course
it
is
totty
had
felt
colder
to
him
than
ever
before
since
she
had
entered
this
room
the
strangeness
of
the
surroundings
affected
her
disagreeably
she
wished
they
had
walked
about
in
the
snowy
streets
course
you
know
we
shall
always
be
quarrelling
she
said
with
a
laugh
we
sha
it
be
different
then
at
all
event
it
be
your
fault
if
we
do
silence
came
again
day
luke
asked
you
like
if
you
really
mean
it
what
the
use
of
talking
in
that
way
why
i
mean
it
i
ask
you
a
question
will
you
answer
me
honest
she
was
leaning
forward
with
a
touch
of
colour
on
her
cheeks
and
a
sudden
curious
light
in
her
eyes
she
seemed
ashamed
at
something
and
both
eager
and
reluctant
is
it
yes
i
answer
you
the
truth
very
truth
no
i
sha
ask
you
what
day
do
you
want
it
to
be
what
was
the
question
i
wo
listen
to
anything
till
you
told
me
was
a
silly
question
i
do
really
want
to
ask
you
i
forget
what
it
was
totty
was
strangely
unlike
herself
hesitating
diffident
ashamed
he
insisted
she
refused
to
speak
he
got
vexed
turned
mute
then
i
ask
you
totty
exclaimed
of
a
sudden
mind
i
shall
know
if
you
honest
or
not
suppose
both
thyrza
trent
and
me
was
in
this
room
and
you
had
your
choice
between
us
which
would
it
be
ackroyd
flushed
then
looked
seriously
offended
you
answer
do
like
to
joke
about
such
things
i
do
either
that
the
truth
that
why
such
a
thing
came
into
my
head
you
need
answer
i
rather
you
did
of
course
i
know
what
you
have
to
say
are
talking
nonsense
there
could
be
a
choice
because
my
choice
will
you
marry
me
or
not
i
will
any
day
you
like
and
afterwards
keep
asking
me
questions
like
this
was
right
i
know
but
you
wrong
when
you
say
i
should
ever
speak
of
it
again
do
know
what
to
think
totty
it
looks
very
much
as
if
did
want
to
have
now
look
here
a
question
for
suppose
i
never
asked
you
before
and
now
i
came
and
asked
you
to
marry
me
what
would
you
say
now
honest
not
answered
me
have
he
spoke
it
significantly
and
she
understood
him
what
you
say
totty
should
say
that
i
could
say
neither
yes
nor
no
for
certain
and
i
wanted
to
wait
an
honest
girl
shake
hands
and
let
us
wait
another
six
months
totty
reddened
and
inwardly
reproached
herself
with
complete
meanness
but
she
was
glad
and

was
glad

the
heart
and
its
secret
thyrza
was
not
to
be
a
boarder
with
the
emersons
nor
did
ormonde
request
them
to
make
a
friend
of
her
nothing
more
was
proposed
than
that
she
should
rent
from
them
their
spare
room
which
was
tolerably
spacious
and
could
be
used
both
as
and
parlour
her
meals
were
to
be
supplied
to
her
by
the
landlady
of
the
house
the
only
stipulation
with
the
emersons
was
that
she
should
receive
her
in
their
where
there
was
a
piano
thyrza
herself
specially
desired
of
ormonde
that
she
might
live
as
much
alone
as
possible
she
declared
that
it
would
be
no
hardship
whatever
to
her
to
be
without
companionship
her
day
occupation
would
be
chiefly
sewing
for
ormonde
had
made
arrangements
that
she
should
have
regular
employment
for
her
needle
from
a
certain
charitable
at
hampstead
for
this
work
she
received
payment
which
ormonde
made
it
appear
would
suffice
to
discharge
her
obligations
to
the
emersons
and
her
landlady
moreover
two
days
of
the
week
she
was
to
spend
at
the
said
home
where
certain
not
too
exacting
duties
were
assigned
to
her
all
this
was
very
neatly
contrived
and
ormonde
felt
rather
proud
of
her
success
in
so
far
meeting
the
requirements
of
a
very
difficult
case
a
competent
judge
had
reported
so
favourably
of
thyrza
voice
that
there
was
a
strong
probability
of
its
some
day
enabling
her
to
earn
a
living
should
that
be
necessary
in
one
of
the
many
paths
which
our
musical
time
opens
to
those
thus
happily
endowed
no
stress
was
laid
on
that
however
for
it
was
far
from
desirable
that
thyrza
should
be
nursed
into
expectation
of
a
golden
future
ormonde
had
determined
that
if
her
exertion
would
accomplish
it
thyrza
should
yet
have
as
large
a
share
of
happiness
as
a
sober
hope
may
claim
for
a
girl
of
passionate
instincts
of
rare
beauty
and
it
might
be
of
latent
genius
to
be
sure
such
claim
can
not
be
extravagant
the
happy
people
of
the
world
are
the
dull
unimaginative
beings
from
whom
the
gods
in
their
kindness
have
veiled
all
vision
of
the
rising
and
the
setting
day
of
and
of
the
stars
of
the
night
whose
ears
are
thickened
against
the
voice
of
music
whose
thought
finds
nowhere
mystery
thyrza
trent
was
not
of
those
what
joys
were
to
be
hers
she
must
pluck
out
of
the
fire
and
there
are
but
few
of
her
kind
whom
in
the
end
the
fire
does
not
consume
but
for
the
present
things
seemed
to
be
set
going
on
a
smooth
track
and
to
be
sure
though
she
had
thought
it
better
to
ask
no
such
kindness
ormonde
knew
that
her
friend
clara
emerson
would
very
shortly
make
a
companion
of
thyrza
it
was
clara
nature
to
make
a
friend
of
any
person
who
gave
a
sign
of
readiness
for
friendly
intercourse
the
fact
of
thyrza
being
untaught
and
a
would
make
no
difference
to
her
when
she
had
discovered
the
sweetness
of
disposition
thyrza
wondered
much
at
the
way
in
which
her
proceeded
with
her
instruction
she
had
looked
forward
to
learning
new
songs
and
she
was
allowed
to
sing
nothing
but
mere
uninteresting
scales
of
notes
a
timid
question
at
length
elicited
one
or
two
abrupt
remarks
which
humbled
but
at
the
same
time
informed
her
the
teacher
like
most
of
his
kind
was
a
poor
creature
of
routine
unburdened
by
imagination
he
had
only
a
larynx
to
deal
with
and
was
at
no
pains
to
realise
that
the
fountain
of
its
notes
was
a
soul
to
be
sure
that
was
a
thought
which
he
was
not
accustomed
to
have
forced
upon
him
humbled
and
informed
thyrza
took
her
lessons
with
faultless
patience
and
with
the
hopeful
zeal
which
makes
light
of
every
difficulty
she
felt
her
voice
improving
and
when
she
sang
to
herself
the
old
songs
she
was
no
longer
satisfied
with
the
old
degree
of
accuracy
a
world
of
which
she
had
had
no
suspicion
was
opening
to
her
music
began
to
mean
something
quite
different
from
the
which
was
all
that
she
had
known
moreover
she
began
to
have
an
inkling
of
the
value
of
her
voice
ormonde
had
scarcely
with
a
word
commended
her
singing
and
had
spoken
of
the
lessons
as
something
that
might
be
useful
with
no
more
emphasis
the
master
of
course
had
only
praise
or
blame
for
the
individual
exercise
but
there
was
someone
in
the
house
who
felt
bound
by
no
considerations
of
prudence
clara
hearing
thyrza
notes
was
entranced
by
them
and
of
course
took
the
first
opportunity
of
saying
so
really
think
i
have
a
good
voice
thyrza
asked
once
when
they
had
grown
accustomed
to
each
other
have
a
splendid
voice
miss
trent
replied
clara
who
delighted
in
bestowing
praise
you
think
i
shall
really
be
able
to
sing
some
day
i
mean
to
people
not
i
fancy
people
will
be
only
too
anxious
to
get
you
to
sing
in
places
like
james
hall
thyrza
asked
her
ears
tingling
at
her
audacity
day
i
no
doubt
whatever
thyrza
sewed
as
a
rule
for
six
hours
a
day
save
of
course
on
the
days
when
she
went
to
the
home
for
her
leisure
she
had
found
so
much
occupation
that
she
seldom
went
to
bed
before
midnight
in
her
walk
to
the
omnibus
which
took
her
to
hampstead
she
had
to
pass
a
and
it
became
her
habit
to
put
aside
sixpence
a
week
more
she
could
not
for
the
purchasing
of
books
with
no
one
to
guide
her
choice
and
restricted
as
she
was
in
the
matter
of
price
she
sometimes
made
strange
acquisitions
she
avoided
story
books
and
bought
only
such
as
seemed
to
her
to
contain
solid
matter
history
by
preference
having
learned
from
gilbert
that
history
was
the
best
thing
to
study
over
these
accumulating
volumes
she
spent
many
a
laborious
hour
at
first
it
was
very
hard
to
keep
awake
much
after
ten
eyelids
grow
so
heavy
and
the
coil
of
golden
hair
she
no
longer
wore
the
long
plait
with
the
blue
ribbon
seemed
such
a
burden
on
the
brain
but
she
strove
with
her
drowsiness
and
like
other
students
soon
made
the
grand
discovery
that
the
fit
once
over
one
is
wider
awake
than
ever
what
hard
hard
things
she
read
universal
history
in
one
fat
little
volume
very
much
spoilt
by
rain
she
made
a
the
of
the
orient
of
greece
of
rome
with
difficulty
not
easily
estimated
she
worked
her
way
through
them
an
english
dictionary
became
a
necessity
she
had
to
wait
three
weeks
before
she
had
money
enough
to
purchase
the
cheapest
she
could
find
at
the
very
beginning
of
tytler
were
such
terrible
words
and
and
and
i
had
someone
to
ask
what
time
it
would
save
me
would
help
me
would
be
glad
to
tell
me
what
long
words
mean
never
mind
she
would
do
it
by
herself
she
had
brains
poor
gilbert
had
so
often
said
that
she
could
learn
anything
in
time
so
the
lamp
burned
on
till
midnight
compendious
old
tytler
in
his
grave
it
should
have
given
him
both
joy
and
sorrow
that
so
sweet
a
face
grew
paler
over
his
long
hard
words
had
she
not
her
reward
before
her
two
years
in
one
way
it
would
be
all
too
short
a
time
not
an
hour
must
be
lost
and
when
the
two
years
had
come
full
circle
and
some
morning
she
was
told
that
someone
wished
to
see
her
and
she
went
down
into
the
and
he
he
stood
before
her
then
she
would
say
and
this
i
have
done
thus
hard
have
i
striven
for
your
sake
because
i
love
you
better
than
my
own
soul
that
secret
no
one
must
suspect
it
no
not
even
lyddy
after
a
hard
night
work
she
would
wake
up
feeling
yet
weary
her
brain
dull
and
a
strange
pain
at
her
heart
the
pain
that
came
so
often
but
whilst
her
thoughts
were
struggling
to
consciousness
she
felt
that
there
was
some
joy
beyond
the
present
pain
and
behold
with
sense
of
the
new
day
came
ever
renewed
hope
she
rose
and
a
bright
angel
circled
her
with
protecting
comforting
arms
dark
or
sunny
for
her
the
morning
had
its
golden
rays
how
near
he
sometimes
might
be
to
her
she
knew
nothing
of
having
left
england
lydia
did
not
and
would
scarcely
have
mentioned
the
name
even
if
she
had
known
thyrza
thought
of
himself
as
always
very
near
there
was
a
possibility
that
she
might
by
chance
see
him
it
would
have
been
very
dear
to
her
to
see
him
at
a
distance
but
she
dreaded
lest
he
should
see
her
that
would
spoil
all
no
it
was
a
sacred
compact
two
years
two
whole
years
had
to
be
lived
through
and
then
no
one
could
say
a
word
against
their
meeting
she
would
be
able
to
sing
to
him
then
if
her
voice
proved
good
enough
for
her
to
sing
in
a
concert
like
concert
at
james
hall
would
he
not
be
proud
of
her
artist
soul
that
she
had
she
never
gave
it
a
thought
that
if
she
became
his
wife
he
might
prefer
that
she
should
not
sing
in
public
she
imagined
herself
before
a
great
hall
of
people
singing
yet
singing
in
truth
to
one
only
but
all
the
others
must
hear
and
praise
that
he
might
have
joy
of
her
power
yet
there
would
be
the
hour
also
for
singing
to
him
alone
they
two
alone
together
would
not
her
song
be
then
the
most
glorious
not
with
her
own
voice
but
with
the
voice
of
very
love
would
she
utter
her
hymn
of
gladness
and
worship
and
he
would
praise
her
in
few
words
more
with
looks
than
with
words
and
again
she
would
say
i
can
sing
and
no
one
can
sing
like
me
but
only
because
i
sing
for
you
and
with
my
soul
i
love
you
she
could
not
often
be
sorrowful
and
never
for
long
together
even
in
thinking
of
the
past
yes
one
day
there
was
of
unbroken
grief
the
day
on
which
she
received
through
ormonde
as
always
the
letter
wherein
lydia
told
her
of
boddy
death
on
that
day
she
shed
bitter
tears
lydia
spared
her
all
that
was
most
painful
she
said
that
the
old
man
had
fallen
insensible
by
the
pooles
house
had
been
taken
in
by
them
and
had
died
she
said
that
just
before
the
end
he
uttered
thyrza
name
and
thyrza
had
thought
too
seldom
of
boddy
to
whom
she
and
her
sister
owed
so
much
had
she
hastened
his
death
she
now
asked
herself
by
bringing
upon
him
a
great
grief
the
common
remorse
the
common
vain
longings
assailed
her
even
in
the
old
days
she
had
somewhat
slighted
him
she
had
never
shown
him
such
love
and
care
as
lydia
always
did
and
the
poor
old
man
was
buried
with
so
much
of
her
past
only
one
little
shadow
there
was
that
fell
upon
her
at
times
when
she
thought
of
egremont
what
was
that
question
of
ormonde
a
question
asked
in
the
overheard
conversation
you
altogether
forgotten
annabel
and
walter
reply
had
shown
that
he
did
once
love
someone
named
annabel
he
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
and
she
strange
beyond
thought
had
refused
him
thyrza
believed
she
could
not
be
quite
sure
but
she
believed
that
she
had
heard
ormonde
address
miss
newthorpe
by
that
name
she
remembered
miss
newthorpe
very
distinctly
her
refined
beauty
her
delightful
playing
strangely
too
she
had
associated
egremont
with
that
lady
in
the
thoughts
she
had
after
her
return
from
eastbourne
if
that
were
annabel
did
there
remain
no
fear
if
he
had
once
loved
her
might
not
the
love
revive
he
and
she
would
meet
doubtless
would
meet
her
beauty
her
accomplishments
would
be
present
and
was
there
no
danger
to
the
newer
love
if
that
memory
were
frequently
brought
back
if
he
had
not
loved
annabel
be
she
who
she
might
if
this
love
for
herself
had
been
his
first
love
how
thankful
she
would
have
been
the
love
she
gave
him
was
her
first
never
had
she
loved
gilbert
grail
though
she
had
thought
her
friendship
for
him
deserved
the
dearer
name
her
first
love
truly
and
would
it
not
be
her
last
very
often
when
she
had
sat
down
to
her
hook
thoughts
of
this
kind
would
come
and
distract
her
what
to
her
were
the
kings
of
old
eastern
lands
the
conquests
of
rome
the
long
chronicles
dense
with
forgotten
battle
and
woe
so
easily
she
could
have
yielded
to
her
former
habits
and
have
passed
hour
after
hour
in
reverie
what
she
wondered
now
had
she
dreamed
of
in
those
days
was
it
not
foresight
of
the
mystery
one
day
to
rule
her
life
had
she
not
visioned
these
sorrows
and
these
priceless
joys
when
as
yet
unable
to
understand
them
indeed
sometimes
there
seemed
no
break
between
then
and
now
she
longed
unconsciously
for
what
was
now
come
that
was
all
everything
had
befallen
so
naturally
so
inevitably
step
by
step
a
rising
from
vision
to
vision
would
the
future
perfect
her
life
progress
but
lydia
was
not
forgotten
to
her
she
wrote
long
letters
telling
all
that
she
might
tell
the
one
thing
of
which
she
would
most
gladly
have
spoken
to
her
sister
must
never
be
touched
upon
for
in
one
respect
lydia
was
against
her
fixedly
against
her
she
had
come
to
know
that
too
well
lydia
bitterly
resented
egremont
coming
between
her
sister
and
gilbert
she
hoped
his
name
would
never
again
be
spoken
and
that
all
remembrance
of
him
would
pass
away
this
made
no
difference
to
thyrza
love
when
she
met
lydia
it
was
always
with
the
same
passionate
joy
their
meetings
took
place
in
a
private
room
at
the
hotel
ormonde
always
used
lydia
never
made
any
inquiry
whatever
she
might
tell
about
herself
thyrza
had
to
tell
unasked
it
would
have
made
a
great
difference
had
there
been
no
secret
to
keep
beyond
that
comparatively
unimportant
one
of
where
thyrza
was
living
but
thyrza
resolved
to
breathe
no
word
till
the
two
years
were
gone
by
would
it
then
make
a
coldness
between
her
and
her
sister
it
should
not
her
happiness
should
not
have
that
great
flaw
when
the
spring
came
thyrza
knew
a
falling
off
in
her
health
the
pain
at
her
heart
gave
her
more
trouble
and
she
had
days
of
such
physical
weakness
that
she
could
do
little
work
with
the
reviving
year
her
passion
became
a
yearning
of
such
intensity
that
it
seemed
to
exhaust
her
frame
for
all
her
endeavours
it
was
seldom
during
these
weeks
that
she
could
give
attention
to
her
books
even
her
voice
failed
for
a
time
and
when
she
resumed
the
suspended
lessons
she
terrified
her
teacher
by
fainting
just
as
he
was
taking
leave
of
her
ormonde
came
and
there
was
a
very
grave
conversation
between
her
and
lambe
who
was
again
attending
thyrza
it
was
declared
that
the
latter
had
been
herself
work
of
all
kind
was
prohibited
for
a
season
and
when
a
week
or
two
brought
about
little
if
any
improvement
thyrza
was
taken
to
eastbourne
to
her
old
quarters
in
mrs
guest
house
there
lydia
spent
two
days
with
her
the
elder
sister
could
not
give
herself
to
full
enjoyment
of
these
days
much
as
she
delighted
to
be
with
thyrza
there
was
always
one
and
the
same
drawback
to
her
pleasure
in
the
meetings
thyrza
was
so
unfeignedly
cheerful
that
lydia
could
by
no
effort
get
rid
of
her
suspicion
that
she
was
being
deceived
she
shrank
from
reopening
the
subject
because
it
was
so
disagreeable
to
her
to
pronounce
name
because
too
she
could
not
betray
doubt
without
offending
thyrza
it
was
hard
to
distrust
thyrza
yet
how
account
for
the
most
strange
apparent
happiness
even
now
though
under
troubled
health
her
sister
spirits
were
good
far
more
easily
lydia
could
have
suspected
ormonde
of
some
duplicity
yet
here
she
was
checked
by
instincts
of
gratitude
and
by
a
sense
of
shame
ormonde
did
not
certainly
impress
her
as
likely
to
be
deceitful
still
though
she
would
not
specify
accusation
lydia
felt
was
convinced
indeed
that
something
very
material
was
being
kept
from
her
it
was
a
cruel
interference
with
the
completeness
of
her
sympathy
in
all
the
conversation
between
thyrza
and
herself
you
are
friends
again
with
mary
bower
thyrza
said
soon
after
they
had
met
you
go
and
have
tea
with
her
on
sundays
sometimes
she
comes
to
me
you
go
to
chapel
thyrza
laughed
seeing
lydia
look
down
lyddy
what
a
trial
it
always
was
to
you
do
you
mind
it
so
much
now
they
were
sitting
on
the
beach
lydia
picked
up
pebbles
and
threw
them
away
do
think
about
it
as
i
used
to
thyrza
she
replied
quietly
after
a
short
pause
go
now
because
i
like
to
go
you
dear
thyrza
said
doubtfully
feeling
there
was
a
change
and
not
understanding
it
always
liked
the
singing
you
know
i
like
the
singing
but
there
more
than
that
i
like
it
all
now
you
said
thyrza
in
yet
a
more
uncertain
voice
lydia
looked
up
and
smiled
brightly
wo
talk
about
it
now
dearest
some
day
we
will
though
a
good
long
talk
when
we
are
again
together
if
we
ever
shall
be
together
again
thyrza
think
so
lyddy
i
hope
so
at
all
events
we
shall
see
each
other
very
often
often
not
always
together
thyrza
was
silent
but
said
presently
we
ca
tell
lyddy
you
do
we
shall
you
do
we
shall
thyrza
did
not
speak
lydia
went
on
very
sadly
all
over
and
gone
something
between
us
and
now
there
always
will
be
always
it
very
hard
for
me
to
lose
you
like
this
speak
about
it
now
lyddy
her
sister
murmured
is
true
that
there
always
be
something
between
us
you
see
but
speak
about
it
now
dear
lydia
brightened
and
found
other
subjects
then
thyrza
said
never
told
me
lyddy
what
it
was
that
first
made
you
break
off
with
mary
you
know
you
never
would
tell
me
is
it
still
a
secret
i
can
tell
you
if
you
like
do
was
because
mary
spoke
against
ackroyd
i
still
do
think
that
she
ought
to
have
spoken
as
she
did
and
mary
owns
she
was
unkind
but
i
understand
better
now
what
she
meant
was
it
she
said
was
about
his
having
no
religion
and
that
because
he
had
none
he
did
things
he
could
have
done
if
he
felt
in
the
right
way
i
understand
thyrza
mused
she
added
still
not
married
not
lyddy
i
do
believe
they
ever
will
be
married
i
do
either
dear
thyrza
looked
quickly
at
her
sister
lydia
was
again
playing
with
pebbles
not
quite
smiling
but
nearly
do
then
what
has
happened
wo
you
tell
me
do
think
they
suit
each
other
there
something
else
i
sure
there
is
you
said
i
either
in
such
a
queer
way
how
do
you
know
they
do
suit
each
other
grandad
death
you
know
i
often
been
to
poole
she
tells
me
things
sometimes
you
must
think
i
ever
ask
thyrza
you
know
that
is
my
way
but
poole
often
speaks
about
her
brother
only
two
days
ago
she
told
me
he
was
going
to
marry
totty
and
i
do
think
you
have
said
a
word
about
it
if
i
made
you
it
broken
off
for
good
believe
it
is
neither
spoke
for
a
while
then
thyrza
said
suppose
you
see
ackroyd
sometimes
at
the
house
the
other
replied
heedlessly
he
talk
to
you
lyddy
little
just
a
little
sometimes
has
he
broken
off
with
totty
what
does
totty
say
about
it
believe
she
was
the
first
to
ask
him
to
break
off
i
met
her
a
week
ago
and
she
looked
very
jolly
as
if
something
good
had
happened
to
her
i
suppose
she
glad
to
be
free
again
queer
it
all
is
lyddy
now
you
might
mention
things
like
this
in
your
letters
if
there
anything
else
of
the
same
kind
happens
remember
you
tell
me
do
see
how
there
can
be
unless
they
begin
over
again
mind
you
tell
me
if
they
do
and
if
they
do
on
the
second
day
of
lydia
visit
they
heard
from
the
chestnuts
that
bessie
bunce
was
dead
she
had
died
suddenly
and
just
when
she
seemed
to
be
in
better
health
than
for
years
thyrza
speaking
of
the
event
with
lydia
said
gravely
ca
feel
sorry
it
a
good
thing
to
die
like
that
with
no
pain
and
no
looking
forward
do
you
think
so
thyrza
there
something
dreadful
in
the
suddenness
to
me
me
it
just
the
opposite
i
afraid
of
death
i
do
think
i
could
sit
by
anybody
that
was
dying
i
hope
i
hope
i
may
die
in
that
way
lydia
was
shocked
and
wondered
grieving
chapter
xxxiv
a
loan
on
security
yet
again
it
was
the
second
summer
since
the
parting
between
lydia
and
her
sister
all
but
the
end
of
the
second
twelvemonth
since
the
day
when
thyrza
had
heard
something
that
was
not
meant
for
her
ears
in
walnut
tree
walk
the
evening
was
clear
and
warm
a
man
was
going
along
the
street
selling
flowers
in
pots
his
was
covered
with
leaf
and
bloom
and
with
a
geranium
under
each
arm
he
trudged
onwards
bellowing
children
were
playing
at
on
the
pavement
you
heard
an
organ
away
in
kennington
road
lydia
was
having
tea
and
trimming
a
bonnet
at
the
same
time
the
bonnet
belonged
to
poole
and
the
work
on
it
was
for
friendship
sake
only
on
that
understanding
had
lydia
consented
to
do
it
poole
had
frequently
wished
to
give
her
an
odd
job
at
needlework
for
which
she
herself
either
had
not
time
or
lacked
the
skill
and
to
pay
for
it
as
she
would
have
had
to
pay
any
one
else
for
some
reason
lydia
declined
to
do
anything
for
her
on
those
conditions
she
would
help
as
a
friend
but
not
otherwise
she
was
hurrying
for
she
wanted
to
take
the
bonnet
to
paradise
street
by
eight
and
it
was
now
seven
her
face
had
the
air
of
thoughtful
contentment
which
best
became
it
her
window
was
open
and
as
in
the
old
days
there
were
on
the
sill
her
eye
now
and
then
rested
for
a
moment
on
the
little
patches
of
colour
she
did
not
think
of
the
flowers
but
they
helped
pleasantly
to
tone
her
mind
even
so
will
a
strain
of
music
sometimes
pass
through
the
memory
unmarked
by
us
yet
completing
the
happiness
of
some
peaceful
hour
she
drank
her
last
drop
of
tea
and
almost
simultaneously
put
her
last
touch
to
the
bonnet
then
she
prepared
herself
for
going
out
hummed
a
tune
whilst
she
carefully
packed
the
piece
of
in
its
bandbox
and
went
on
her
way
when
poole
answered
her
knock
at
the
lydia
said
hope
you
like
it
i
shall
see
you
on
sunday
and
you
tell
me
then
where
are
you
going
why
wo
you
come
in
i
have
to
buy
something
in
for
a
minute
then
thank
you
not
as
i
tell
you
said
the
other
with
persistence
believe
you
ashamed
of
your
work
and
that
why
you
running
away
come
in
at
once
lydia
yielded
though
seemingly
with
reluctance
they
went
down
into
the
kitchen
where
the
two
young
pooles
were
at
an
uproarious
game
there
been
just
about
enough
of
that
exclaimed
their
mother
raising
her
voice
to
be
heard
trent
think
we
have
a
down
here
you
must
play
quietly
or
off
you
go
to
bed
i
mean
it
the
bonnet
was
taken
forth
and
examined
with
many
ejaculations
of
delight
from
its
owner
the
only
article
of
attire
upon
which
poole
ever
spent
a
thought
was
her
bonnet
a
noteworthy
instance
of
the
inconsequence
of
human
nature
seeing
that
it
was
the
rarest
thing
for
her
to
leave
the
house
save
when
she
ran
out
at
night
to
make
purchases
and
then
she
always
donned
an
object
of
straw
whose
utility
was
its
only
merit
though
as
happy
a
woman
as
you
could
have
found
in
lambeth
she
seldom
had
a
moment
of
leisure
from
to
bedtime
her
kind
are
very
numerous
such
women
pass
through
a
whole
summer
without
an
hour
of
rest
in
the
sunshine
and
often
through
a
married
lifetime
without
going
beyond
the
circle
of
neighbouring
streets
but
the
bonnet
delighted
her
she
tried
it
on
and
having
placed
a
on
the
table
went
through
the
wonderful
feat
in
which
women
are
so
skilled
that
of
seeing
the
back
of
her
head
then
having
constrained
lydia
to
sit
down
she
pursued
multifarious
occupations
talking
the
while
hope
you
do
notice
any
bad
smells
in
the
house
she
said
luke
at
his
usual
work
upstairs
what
pleasure
he
can
find
in
that
is
more
than
i
can
understand
i
know
he
ruined
my
table
with
his
chemicals
there
jacky
with
him
too
if
i
was
bunce
i
should
be
afraid
to
have
the
boy
taught
such
things
he
set
the
house
on
fire
some
day
will
master
jack
and
burn
himself
and
his
little
sister
to
death
you
see
said
lydia
ackroyd
does
keep
to
it
you
think
he
persevere
more
than
a
week
or
two
and
now
it
must
be
a
good
three
months
yes
it
look
as
if
it
was
going
to
be
different
from
the
other
things
poole
admitted
with
a
grudging
laugh
he
always
had
a
liking
for
reading
books
of
that
kind
let
hope
he
knows
his
own
mind
at
last
but
then
he
ca
never
do
anything
in
moderation
ca
luke
he
got
an
idea
into
his
head
that
he
going
to
invent
a
new
kind
of
candle
if
you
ever
heard
such
a
thing
says
i
to
him
last
night
when
he
come
talking
to
me
about
it
what
i
call
a
here
a
while
ago
you
was
content
with
nothing
but
setting
the
world
upside
down
now
you
be
satisfied
if
you
can
invent
a
new
candle
and
make
money
out
of
it
well
i
says
be
above
candles
luke
my
you
should
have
seen
how
angry
he
got
who
said
he
wanted
to
make
money
who
ever
heard
him
mentioning
money
he
like
to
know
if
people
had
low
minds
that
was
his
fault
and
then
he
went
off
grumbling
to
himself
ventured
lydia
with
diffidence
do
see
there
any
harm
even
if
he
did
think
of
making
money
do
you
mrs
poole
i
child
i
only
talked
so
just
to
tease
him
i
do
so
like
to
tease
luke
he
puts
on
such
airs
let
him
make
money
of
course
if
he
can
all
the
better
for
him
i
a
deal
rather
have
him
doing
this
than
spending
all
his
nights
at
that
club
in
westminster
bridge
road
talking
nonsense
and
worse
why
he
ever
so
much
better
to
live
with
now
than
he
used
to
be
he
really
does
talk
sensible
sometimes
and
he
is
such
a
great
baby
about
about
some
things
poole
smiled
and
held
her
tongue
what
the
last
news
from
your
sister
was
her
next
question
i
had
a
letter
yesterday
lydia
replied
her
face
lighting
up
was
all
about
the
concert
next
wednesday
well
she
must
be
full
of
it
must
she
now
it
must
be
a
trying
thing
to
sing
for
the
first
time
it
is
so
bad
as
if
she
had
to
sing
alone
you
know
to
be
sure
but
it
must
be
bad
enough
even
in
a
choir
sha
you
see
her
before
the
night
and
i
sha
be
able
to
speak
to
her
on
wednesday
either
but
the
next
day
we
shall
have
all
the
evening
together
she
sent
me
my
ticket
look
i
brought
it
to
show
you
it
was
a
ticket
for
a
concert
in
one
of
the
suburbs
of
london
lydia
kept
it
in
an
envelope
and
handled
it
with
care
poole
before
taking
it
wiped
her
hands
on
her
apron
and
then
held
the
card
between
the
tips
of
her
thumb
and
middle
finger
her
name
be
on
the
programme
she
asked
they
called
redfern
choir
that
all
i
sure
it
very
nice
and
something
to
be
proud
of
and
she
still
keeps
her
health
says
she
is
very
well
indeed
poole
added
lydia
lowering
her
voice
have
said
anything
about
it
no
my
dear
not
i
better
not
i
think
of
course
it
does
really
matter
but
still
you
i
understand
very
well
lydia
there
no
occasion
to
talk
about
such
things
at
all
i
suppose
mary
bower
knows
yes
i
told
mary
she
have
liked
to
go
with
you
i
sure
she
would
but
i
think
i
rather
be
alone
there
be
another
concert
before
long
i
dare
say
and
then
she
shall
go
just
this
first
time
you
know
it
was
a
cosy
kitchen
and
lydia
once
seated
here
seemed
to
forget
about
the
shopping
of
which
she
had
spoken
poole
stream
of
talk
was
intimate
and
soothing
plenty
of
good
sense
no
scandal
and
no
lack
of
blitheness
but
at
length
it
was
declared
to
be
the
bed
time
and
lydia
made
this
the
signal
for
rising
to
take
her
leave
do
sit
still
urged
poole
such
a
restless
body
i
got
lots
of
things
i
want
to
talk
about
yet
if
only
i
could
think
of
them
really
must
go
lydia
pleaded
you
must
now
i
sha
be
a
minute
getting
these
children
off
to
bed
and
then
we
have
just
five
minutes
comfortable
talk
just
sew
me
a
new
tape
into
that
apron
there
a
good
girl
you
know
where
the
cotton
is
on
the
dresser
up
there
lydia
took
up
the
task
cheerfully
and
by
when
it
was
completed
the
youngsters
were
stripped
and
and
ready
to
say
their
reluctant
their
mother
carried
them
upstairs
one
on
her
back
and
one
in
her
arms
good
strong
mother
and
the
chat
was
renewed
till
the
next
event
of
the
evening
supper
had
to
be
prepared
for
lydia
seemed
to
have
given
up
the
struggle
she
consented
to
stay
for
the
meal
without
much
pressing
when
the
table
was
laid
poole
went
upstairs
to
her
brother
bedroom
on
opening
the
door
she
was
met
with
a
very
strong
odour
of
chemical
experimentalising
despite
the
warmth
of
the
season
there
was
a
fire
with
two
or
three
singular
pots
boiling
upon
it
a
table
was
covered
with
jars
and
phials
and
and
retorts
here
ackroyd
was
bending
to
explain
something
to
a
little
lad
jacky
bunce
luke
had
allowed
his
beard
to
grow
of
late
and
it
improved
his
appearance
he
looked
more
than
formerly
he
was
in
his
jacky
began
poole
your
father
say
to
you
staying
out
till
these
hours
he
think
you
blowed
up
why
it
nine
right
jane
said
ackroyd
and
i
have
had
a
deal
of
talk
about
the
compounds
of
hydrogen
if
i
was
his
mother
him
and
i
would
have
a
deal
of
talk
about
waistcoats
rejoined
poole
shrewdly
declare
luke
you
ought
to
tie
an
apron
over
him
if
he
going
to
make
that
mess
of
himself
an
old
waistcoat
poole
protested
jack
keep
it
on
purpose
you
do
well
mind
it
do
go
through
to
your
shirt
that
all
now
run
away
home
jacky
there
a
good
boy
sha
be
five
minutes
more
interposed
luke
coming
down
myself
in
five
minutes
supper
waiting
and
here
miss
trent
here
too
not
that
that
make
you
come
any
quicker
perhaps
i
better
not
have
mentioned
it
jane
pressed
her
lips
together
after
speaking
and
withdrew
you
like
miss
trent
mr
ackroyd
jack
inquired
when
they
were
left
alone
he
was
as
i
have
said
a
boy
and
luke
could
have
given
wonderful
reports
of
his
keenness
of
brain
it
is
often
thus
the
father
has
faculties
which
never
ripen
in
himself
and
which
as
likely
as
not
cause
him
a
life
struggle
and
unrest
they
come
to
maturity
and
efficiency
in
the
son
what
more
pathetic
rightly
considered
than
the
story
of
those
fathers
whose
lives
are
but
a
preparation
for
the
richer
lives
of
their
sons
poor
bunce
fighting
with
his
ignorance
and
his
passions
unable
to
overcome
either
obstinate
in
holding
on
to
a
catching
momentary
glimpses
of
a
ideal
what
did
it
all
mean
but
that
his
boy
should
stand
where
had
been
thrown
should
see
light
where
eyes
had
striven
vainly
against
the
fog
perhaps
there
is
compensation
to
the
parent
if
he
live
to
see
the
lad
conquering
but
what
of
those
who
fall
into
silence
when
all
is
still
uncertain
when
they
recognise
in
their
offspring
an
hereditary
weakness
and
danger
as
often
as
a
rare
gleam
of
new
promise
one
would
bow
reverently
and
sadly
by
the
graves
of
such
men
it
was
a
happy
thought
of
ackroyd
to
give
the
boy
lessons
in
chemistry
to
teach
is
often
the
surest
way
of
learning
in
explaining
simple
things
luke
often
enough
discovered
for
the
first
time
his
own
ignorance
in
very
fact
the
greater
part
of
the
past
two
years
had
been
spent
by
him
in
making
discoveries
of
that
nature
long
before
he
thought
of
new
combinations
of
oleaginous
matter
by
degrees
he
had
come
to
suspect
that
as
regarded
the
employment
of
his
leisure
hours
he
was
very
decidedly
on
the
wrong
track
curiously
for
ackroyd
as
well
as
for
bunce
there
had
arisen
a
measure
of
evil
from
walter
egremont
aspiring
work
luke
though
not
to
such
a
violent
degree
as
bunce
was
led
to
offer
opposition
to
everything
savouring
of
idealism
that
is
to
say
of
idealism
as
egremont
had
presented
it
he
had
heard
but
one
of
walter
lectures
yet
that
was
enough
to
realise
for
him
the
kind
of
thing
which
henceforth
he
disliked
and
distrusted
egremont
it
seemed
to
him
had
sought
to
make
working
men
priggish
and
effeminate
whereas
what
they
wanted
was
and
consciousness
of
the
bard
facts
of
life
ackroyd
had
never
cared
much
for
literature
proper
his
intellectual
progress
was
henceforth
to
be
in
the
direction
of
hostility
to
literature
when
his
various
love
difficulties
ceased
to
absorb
all
his
attention
he
went
back
to
his
scientific
books
and
found
that
his
appetite
for
such
studies
was
keener
than
ever
at
length
he
converted
his
bedroom
into
a
laboratory
resolved
to
pursue
certain
investigations
seriously
when
his
heart
or
diaphragm
or
whatever
else
it
may
be
left
him
at
peace
his
brain
could
work
to
sufficient
purpose
and
of
late
he
had
worked
most
vigorously
he
ceased
to
trouble
himself
about
politics
and
religion
and
social
matters
his
views
thereon
he
declared
had
undergone
no
change
whatever
but
he
had
no
time
to
talk
at
present
but
a
question
of
jack
waited
for
an
answer
only
my
sister
fun
luke
replied
with
a
smile
no
reason
why
i
should
like
her
think
she
do
look
bad
jack
remarked
as
if
allowing
himself
to
stray
from
chemistry
to
a
matter
of
trivial
interest
he
added
she
do
come
up
to
miss
nancarrow
i
like
she
the
right
kind
of
girl
do
you
think
so
say
ackroyd
why
do
you
never
come
now
and
call
for
her
like
you
used
to
to
when
you
know
well
enough
not
long
ago
years
ago
not
more
than
a
year
ago
jack
a
year
and
a
half
it
did
seem
so
long
i
say
why
do
you
i
only
just
thought
of
it
no
need
to
call
i
see
her
sometimes
and
that
enough
for
friends
is
it
believe
you
was
going
to
marry
miss
nancarrow
was
you
who
told
you
such
a
thing
as
that
i
thought
of
it
myself
it
looks
like
it
when
i
think
older
now
you
see
than
i
was
then
i
see
more
into
things
ackroyd
laughed
heartily
seems
you
do
but
tell
me
mr
ackroyd
i
sha
when
you
get
a
bit
older
still
you
know
that
men
have
no
business
to
talk
about
such
things
understand
that
jack
never
get
into
the
way
of
talking
about
things
that
are
your
business
there
been
a
deal
of
harm
done
by
that
there
luke
was
silent
the
boy
continued
sure
you
friends
with
miss
nancarrow
course
i
am
capital
friends
why
we
were
both
of
us
on
the
greenwich
boat
last
sunday
and
we
laughed
and
talked
no
end
of
time
but
luke
was
ready
to
leave
the
room
he
appointed
another
evening
when
jack
should
come
and
the
lad
scampered
off
leaving
ackroyd
to
go
down
and
have
supper
with
his
sister
and
lydia
and
with
poole
who
had
just
come
home
from
a
late
job
let
us
go
after
jack
into
newport
street
as
he
reached
the
house
his
father
was
just
coming
out
too
late
said
the
latter
with
a
shake
of
the
head
ackroyd
you
must
be
back
by
nine
what
about
your
lessons
eh
exclaimed
jack
scornfully
them
in
half
a
crack
before
breakfast
why
there
nothing
but
a
bit
of
jography
and
some
kings
and
three
proportion
sums
and
a
page
of
right
go
to
bed
quietly
nelly
asleep
long
ago
i
shall
be
back
in
half
an
hour
jack
went
very
softly
upstairs
in
the
one
room
which
was
still
the
entire
home
of
his
father
and
himself
and
his
little
sister
he
found
a
lamp
burning
low
the
child
was
in
her
small
cot
sleeping
peacefully
jack
began
to
unbutton
his
waistcoat
having
seized
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
that
lay
waiting
for
him
when
his
thoughts
intervened
to
suspend
the
operation
of
undressing
he
left
the
room
again
and
looked
at
the
door
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
landing
he
saw
a
light
beneath
it
he
advanced
and
rapped
softly
that
was
asked
from
within
ai
in
bed
yet
miss
nancarrow
are
you
jack
asked
with
the
frankness
of
expression
which
became
his
age
the
door
opened
and
totty
appeared
able
to
receive
visitors
still
with
perfect
propriety
is
it
jacky
the
lad
was
munching
his
bread
and
butter
have
got
a
spoonful
of
that
jam
left
have
you
miss
nancarrow
he
asked
with
a
mixture
of
confidence
and
shamefacedness
totty
laughed
dare
say
i
have
but
this
is
a
nice
time
to
come
asking
for
jam
is
your
father
in
out
says
he
be
half
an
hour
plenty
of
time
miss
nancarrow
in
then
totty
closed
the
door
and
produced
from
her
cupboard
a
receptacle
regarded
with
profound
interest
both
by
nelly
and
the
maturer
jack
a
pot
of
black
currant
preserve
she
spread
some
with
a
liberal
hand
on
the
lad
bread
then
watched
him
as
he
ate
her
enjoyment
equalling
his
own
the
bread
finished
she
offered
a
spoonful
of
jam
pure
and
simple
it
was
swallowed
with
gusto
say
miss
nancarrow
remarked
jack
do
going
to
a
new
house
i
ca
see
what
father
wants
to
move
for
we
well
enough
off
here
do
you
want
to
go
there
a
good
many
things
i
should
mind
so
much
you
know
if
you
was
coming
as
well
again
she
laughed
as
much
as
to
say
jack
you
be
sorry
when
there
no
jam
it
is
not
it
be
so
sure
i
shall
come
and
see
you
often
enough
and
not
for
jam
either
you
always
jolly
with
me
and
i
do
see
why
you
come
as
well
father
like
you
to
totty
regarded
him
with
a
smile
for
an
instant
then
asked
carelessly
do
you
know
that
as
if
it
made
any
difference
to
your
father
he
said
he
wished
you
was
coming
he
said
so
day
before
yesterday
now
get
off
to
bed
he
be
back
and
we
shall
both
get
scolded
jack
drew
to
the
door
but
totty
recalled
him
an
idea
for
your
father
to
say
he
wished
i
was
coming
tell
me
how
he
said
it
it
was
about
nelly
we
was
talking
and
saying
nelly
miss
you
and
father
said
half
to
himself
like
would
be
sorry
if
miss
nancarrow
come
and
be
with
her
always
and
i
dare
say
somebody
else
would
be
sorry
either
you
silly
boy
he
meant
you
of
course
no
he
did
think
i
ca
tell
what
he
meant
off
to
bed
i
think
i
hear
your
father
coming
in
jack
made
a
rush
and
in
one
minute
and
a
half
was
under
the
the
removal
which
bunce
was
about
to
effect
signified
an
improvement
of
circumstances
it
was
time
for
his
luck
to
turn
year
after
year
he
had
found
himself
still
at
grip
with
poverty
the
shadow
of
his
evil
domestic
experiences
lengthened
as
he
drew
further
away
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
never
get
beyond
it
to
a
man
of
any
native
delicacy
the
memory
of
bondage
to
a
hateful
woman
clings
like
a
long
disease
which
impoverishes
the
blood
there
is
only
one
way
of
eradicating
it
and
that
is
with
the
aid
of
a
strong
wholesome
new
emotion
and
at
length
bunce
began
to
feel
that
the
past
was
really
past
one
sign
of
it
was
the
better
fortune
which
enabled
him
to
earn
more
money
one
of
his
children
was
dead
but
the
other
two
were
growing
in
health
of
mind
and
body
and
he
could
clothe
them
better
could
look
forward
to
their
future
at
last
without
that
sinking
of
the
heart
which
at
times
had
made
him
pause
by
night
on
one
of
the
river
bridges
and
long
for
a
moment
madness
that
he
might
plunge
and
have
done
with
everything
few
men
had
come
out
of
darkness
into
the
light
of
a
sober
working
day
with
less
help
than
he
had
had
it
was
his
nature
to
keep
silence
on
his
difficulties
he
did
not
much
care
to
hold
continuous
friendship
with
any
man
for
like
all
who
have
the
habit
of
talking
to
themselves
he
was
conscious
that
his
companionship
lacked
attraction
moreover
a
thing
which
superficial
observers
do
not
realise
like
all
who
are
most
genuinely
at
odds
with
the
world
the
first
head
of
his
quarrel
was
with
himself
he
was
only
too
well
aware
of
his
own
defects
and
errors
he
felt
himself
to
be
unamiable
often
gross
of
understanding
always
ready
to
fall
into
a
blunder
which
other
men
would
avoid
he
had
stood
in
his
own
way
as
often
as
he
had
been
balked
by
others
perhaps
oftener
now
he
was
going
to
risk
a
step
forward
was
going
to
leave
his
single
room
lodging
and
take
two
rooms
in
a
brighter
street
some
distance
away
they
would
be
vacant
for
him
a
fortnight
hence
and
he
had
money
enough
to
buy
furniture
yet
he
did
not
look
forward
to
the
change
as
cheerfully
as
might
have
been
expected
for
one
reason
and
for
one
only
the
old
abode
was
preferable
to
him
it
was
a
reason
of
such
weight
that
it
cost
him
no
little
exertion
of
common
sense
to
put
it
aside
at
the
same
time
it
to
be
put
aside
and
most
resolutely
for
whenever
it
occupied
his
mind
he
soon
found
himself
uttering
contemptuous
remarks
upon
his
own
folly
he
would
sometimes
blurt
out
such
words
as
idiot
blockhead
as
he
walked
along
the
street
astonishing
who
could
not
be
supposed
to
know
that
the
speaker
was
applying
these
epithets
to
himself
on
sunday
evening
a
day
or
two
after
the
conversation
just
reported
between
jack
and
totty
bunce
took
his
children
to
battersea
park
when
there
he
did
not
walk
about
among
the
people
but
sought
a
retired
piece
of
lawn
and
sat
down
to
enjoy
a
pipe
nelly
had
brought
a
doll
with
her
and
found
delectable
occupation
in
explaining
to
it
all
the
various
objects
which
might
reasonably
excite
its
curiosity
in
such
a
place
jack
talked
with
his
father
of
chemistry
of
his
school
teachers
of
what
he
would
be
when
he
was
a
man
their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
nelly
exclaiming
there
miss
nancarrow
totty
was
coming
over
the
grass
at
a
little
distance
between
two
companions
girls
dressed
with
an
emphasis
of
sunday
elegance
which
made
her
look
rather
brown
and
plain
by
contrast
totty
never
cared
to
spend
much
on
clothes
a
singular
feature
of
her
character
when
the
three
were
passing
at
a
distance
of
twenty
yards
nelly
cried
out
with
shrill
voice
nancarrow
child
said
her
father
more
annoyed
than
seemed
necessary
scream
at
people
in
that
way
nelly
was
abashed
but
her
cry
had
caught
totty
ear
the
latter
nodded
laughed
and
went
on
with
her
friends
say
father
jack
began
you
know
what
i
think
boy
i
think
if
you
asked
miss
nancarrow
to
come
and
take
a
room
in
the
new
house
she
would
on
earth
should
i
ask
her
to
do
such
a
thing
inquired
bunce
laying
down
his
pipe
on
the
grass
it
had
gone
out
since
passing
he
looked
at
his
son
with
bent
brows
and
rather
fiercely
i
know
i
like
her
to
and
so
would
nelly
i
can
get
on
with
miss
nancarrow
she
got
so
much
sense
i
do
think
much
of
other
women
bunce
grubbed
up
roots
of
grass
with
his
hard
blunt
fingers
then
he
took
up
his
pipe
again
and
turned
the
stem
about
between
his
teeth
and
the
while
he
cast
glances
at
jack
side
glances
half
savage
makes
you
think
she
come
he
inquired
at
length
with
a
blundering
attempt
at
indifference
of
tone
talked
to
her
about
it
the
other
night
you
did
did
you
and
what
business
had
you
to
talk
about
such
things
i
like
to
know
do
see
no
harm
i
told
her
we
all
be
glad
if
she
come
the
confusion
and
who
told
you
to
say
any
such
thing
jack
was
amazed
at
the
outburst
of
wrath
he
had
provoked
father
he
muttered
heard
you
say
yourself
that
you
be
glad
if
she
was
coming
i
thank
you
not
to
repeat
what
i
say
leave
miss
nancarrow
alone
if
i
find
you
talked
to
her
in
that
way
again
you
and
me
quarrel
jack
the
boy
fell
into
a
fit
of
sulks
and
drew
to
a
little
distance
where
he
lay
fiat
beating
the
earth
vigorously
with
a
stick
then
it
strangely
happened
that
someone
came
round
the
bushes
in
the
shadow
of
which
the
three
were
reposing
and
that
it
was
no
other
than
miss
nancarrow
this
time
unaccompanied
bunce
did
not
notice
her
till
she
stood
before
him
then
he
jumped
to
his
feet
disturb
yourself
bunce
said
totty
with
her
usual
only
going
to
have
a
talk
with
nelly
that
all
she
sat
down
on
the
grass
by
the
little
one
and
began
a
grave
dialogue
on
the
subject
of
certain
ailments
from
which
the
doll
had
recently
recovered
it
had
been
nursed
through
measles
nelly
having
had
them
not
long
ago
and
its
face
still
showed
signs
of
the
disease
jack
was
not
disposed
to
talk
his
discretion
had
been
impugned
and
at
jack
age
one
feels
anything
of
that
kind
shrewdly
letting
his
eyes
wander
about
the
portion
of
park
that
lay
before
them
he
saw
at
a
little
distance
the
nucleus
of
a
religious
meeting
at
any
other
time
he
would
have
scorned
to
pay
attention
to
such
a
phenomenon
at
present
he
was
glad
of
any
opportunity
of
asserting
his
independence
he
knew
his
father
ridiculed
consequently
he
rose
and
began
to
walk
in
the
direction
of
the
group
of
people
are
you
going
jack
cried
bunce
for
a
walk
i
come
back
his
father
acquiesced
totty
suspended
her
talk
and
gazed
after
him
for
a
moment
then
she
turned
to
bunce
you
found
rooms
mr
bunce
she
said
with
a
piece
of
sorrel
between
her
lips
i
got
two
that
suit
us
i
think
he
mentioned
where
they
were
and
made
a
few
remarks
about
them
there
anything
i
can
do
to
help
you
said
totty
looking
at
jack
distant
figure
tell
me
i
know
there
might
be
some
sewing
i
got
plenty
of
time
window
blinds
and
those
things
i
made
arrangements
about
all
that
with
the
landlady
bunce
replied
in
some
embarrassment
thank
you
very
much
miss
nancarrow
all
the
same
too
bad
of
you
you
knew
very
well
i
have
been
glad
to
help
tell
your
father
he
very
soon
forgetting
his
old
friends
nelly
she
drew
the
child
to
her
as
she
spoke
and
kissed
her
cheek
know
very
well
i
sha
do
that
miss
nancarrow
said
bunce
glancing
at
her
else
i
not
likely
to
forget
you
not
so
sure
of
that
are
you
nelly
he
said
nothing
totty
let
her
eyes
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
face
he
was
looking
down
and
again
grubbing
up
grass
shall
be
very
sorry
if
you
do
come
and
see
the
children
sometimes
he
mumbled
at
all
events
i
hope
they
can
come
and
see
you
you
still
work
at
the
same
shop
totty
asked
paying
no
attention
to
the
last
remark
for
a
bit
at
all
events
do
you
start
a
shop
of
your
own
mr
bunce
she
next
inquired
as
if
a
happy
idea
had
struck
her
should
mind
doing
that
he
answered
with
a
hard
laugh
shops
ca
be
had
for
the
wishing
do
need
a
big
one
now
like
that
shop
in
duke
street
you
know
what
the
rent
of
a
place
like
that
sure
i
do
know
i
suppose
it
goes
with
the
house
what
the
rent
of
the
house
likely
to
be
you
could
let
all
you
did
want
you
know
and
that
almost
pay
the
rent
i
should
think
he
laughed
again
the
good
of
talking
about
it
why
there
a
little
and
ironmonger
shop
to
let
in
that
street
just
off
the
far
end
of
lambeth
walk
they
selling
off
now
i
going
to
buy
a
few
things
but
what
the
good
of
thinking
about
it
do
know
what
the
rent
more
than
forty
pounds
house
and
all
i
dare
say
a
mate
of
mine
was
talking
about
it
he
said
he
wished
he
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
to
take
it
and
start
the
man
dead
and
his
wife
wanted
to
sell
the
business
but
she
ca
get
an
offer
the
meeting
which
jack
was
attending
had
began
to
sing
a
hymn
the
voices
harmonised
by
distance
sounded
pleasantly
like
that
bunce
said
totty
you
do
think
much
about
hymns
miss
nancarrow
you
might
say
you
like
it
do
to
tell
the
truth
so
long
as
i
ca
hear
the
words
do
care
nothing
about
the
words
either
so
we
agree
about
something
at
all
events
do
think
we
differed
about
many
things
have
we
she
looked
at
him
frankly
and
smiled
then
she
said
you
used
to
be
a
bit
afraid
of
me
i
know
shall
i
tell
you
what
it
was
made
us
real
friends
it
was
when
you
burnt
your
hand
and
i
did
it
up
for
you
bunce
now
returned
her
look
and
his
swarthy
cheeks
reddened
his
eyes
fell
again
behaved
very
kindly
he
said
in
a
way
forget
and
i
not
likely
ever
to
and
i
sha
forget
all
you
done
for
the
children
either
i
do
think
there
any
one
living
more
to
thank
for
than
you
idea
it
true
look
here
bunce
about
that
shop
suppose
you
had
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
could
you
make
a
start
do
you
think
rather
suppose
i
could
and
where
two
hundred
and
fifty
pound
to
come
from
miss
nancarrow
lend
it
you
if
you
like
he
gazed
at
her
with
so
strange
a
face
that
totty
broke
into
hearty
laughter
bunce
joined
appreciating
the
joke
mean
it
bunce
i
got
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
at
all
events
i
can
have
whenever
i
like
he
gazed
again
wondering
at
her
tone
i
see
you
do
believe
me
so
i
shall
have
to
explain
she
told
him
the
story
of
her
legacy
only
forbearing
to
speak
of
the
condition
attached
to
it
you
let
me
lend
it
you
mr
bunce
i
sure
i
sha
miss
nancarrow
you
have
plenty
of
use
for
that
yourself
here
nelly
the
child
was
listening
to
this
remarkable
dialogue
and
trying
to
understand
your
father
he
to
do
just
what
i
want
if
he
does
i
never
speak
again
neither
to
you
nor
jacky
now
i
mean
it
father
said
nelly
what
miss
nancarrow
wants
bunce
kept
his
face
half
averted
he
was
at
a
dire
pass
mr
bunce
all
nonsense
he
exclaimed
can
i
tell
that
i
should
ever
be
able
to
pay
you
back
you
wo
course
i
ca
it
just
like
you
to
offer
but
of
course
i
ca
well
i
ca
help
it
she
lowered
her
voice
forgot
to
tell
you
that
i
ca
get
the
money
till
i
married
it
does
matter
i
offered
it
bunce
stared
at
her
nelly
totty
went
on
ca
be
friends
with
you
after
this
your
father
told
me
to
go
about
my
business
he
has
protested
the
child
dolorously
have
have
you
father
he
has
it
does
matter
i
off
she
jumped
up
bunce
sprang
to
his
feet
at
the
same
time
and
caught
her
up
in
a
moment
she
turned
looked
at
him
reddened
laughed
did
you
say
anything
about
that
money
he
began
able
to
speak
without
restraint
at
length
i
had
known
about
that
do
see
what
the
money
got
to
do
with
it
do
look
i
should
have
felt
like
making
a
fool
of
myself
a
man
of
my
age
and
with
two
children
but
i
do
believe
when
i
got
into
those
new
rooms
i
could
have
helped
some
day
asking
you
if
well
i
say
it
i
ashamed
of
myself
that
the
truth
what
does
that
matter
bunce
so
long
as
i
not
ashamed
of
you
you
might
do
so
well
a
man
like
me
and
the
children
you
talk
do
you
think
i
fond
of
the
children
and
sit
down
again
and
talk
a
bit
will
you
have
the
money
bunce
or
wo
you
very
much
rather
have
you
without
it
totty
and
that
the
honest
truth
but
you
ca
you
see
now
you
have
a
rare
tale
to
tell
of
me
some
day
when
you
tired
of
me
and
it
all
come
of
your
changing
your
lodgings
know
you
do
know
come
and
sit
down
and
i
tell
you
totty
went
back
and
fondled
nelly
against
her
side
and
explained
why
the
threatened
change
of
abode
had
made
her
act
with
such
independence
characteristic
to
the
end
chapter
xxxv
three
letters
egremont
to
i
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
natural
life
in
this
country
which
assuredly
i
have
no
intention
of
doing
i
think
i
should
never
settle
down
to
an
hour
indulgence
of
those
tastes
which
were
born
in
me
and
which
in
spite
of
all
neglect
are
in
fact
as
strong
as
ever
i
can
not
read
the
books
i
wish
to
read
i
can
not
even
think
the
thoughts
i
wish
to
think
as
i
have
told
you
the
volumes
i
brought
out
with
me
lay
in
their
for
more
than
six
months
after
my
arrival
and
for
all
the
use
i
have
made
of
them
in
this
second
six
months
they
might
be
still
there
the
shelves
in
the
room
which
i
call
my
library
are
furnished
but
i
dare
not
look
how
much
dust
they
have
accumulated
read
scarcely
anything
but
newspapers
it
is
i
who
write
the
words
newspapers
at
morning
newspapers
at
night
yes
one
exception
i
have
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
of
late
over
walt
whitman
you
know
him
of
course
by
name
though
i
dare
say
you
have
never
looked
into
his
works
and
i
expect
that
i
shall
spend
a
good
deal
more
i
suspect
indeed
that
he
will
in
the
end
come
to
mean
much
to
me
but
i
can
not
write
of
him
yet
i
am
struggling
with
him
struggling
with
myself
as
regards
him
in
a
month
or
so
i
shall
have
more
to
say
it
is
perfectly
true
then
that
till
quite
recently
i
have
read
but
newspapers
the
people
about
me
scarcely
by
any
chance
read
anything
else
and
the
influence
of
surroundings
has
from
the
first
been
very
strong
upon
me
you
have
complained
frequently
that
i
say
nothing
to
you
about
my
it
is
one
of
the
signs
of
my
condition
that
with
difficulty
i
think
of
that
self
and
to
pen
words
about
it
has
been
quite
impossible
i
long
constantly
for
the
old
world
and
the
old
moods
but
i
can
not
imagine
myself
back
into
them
i
would
give
anything
to
lock
my
door
at
night
and
take
down
my
euripides
if
i
get
as
far
as
the
shelf
my
hand
drops
begin
to
see
a
meaning
in
this
phase
of
my
life
i
have
been
learning
something
about
the
latter
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
its
civilisation
its
possibilities
and
the
subject
has
a
keen
interest
for
me
is
it
new
then
you
will
ask
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
knew
nothing
whatever
about
it
until
i
came
and
began
to
work
in
america
i
am
in
the
mood
for
frankness
and
i
wo
spare
myself
all
my
study
of
modern
life
in
former
days
was
the
merest
dilettantism
mere
conceit
and
boyish
pedantry
i
travelled
and
the
fact
that
wherever
i
went
i
took
a
small
classical
library
with
me
was
symbolical
of
my
state
of
mind
i
saw
everything
through
spectacles
even
in
america
i
could
not
get
rid
of
my
pedantry
as
you
will
recognise
clearly
enough
if
you
look
back
to
the
letters
i
wrote
you
at
that
time
i
came
then
with
theories
in
my
head
of
what
american
civilisation
must
be
and
everything
that
i
saw
i
made
fit
in
with
my
preconceptions
this
time
i
came
with
my
mind
a
blank
i
was
ill
and
had
not
a
theory
left
in
me
on
any
subject
in
the
universe
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
was
suffering
all
that
a
man
can
suffer
when
the
atlantic
roared
about
me
i
scarcely
cared
whether
it
engulfed
me
or
not
getting
back
my
health
i
began
to
see
with
new
eyes
and
have
since
been
looking
my
hardest
and
i
have
still
not
a
theory
on
any
subject
in
the
universe
fact
i
believe
that
for
me
the
day
of
theories
has
gone
by
i
note
phenomena
and
muse
about
them
and
not
a
few
interest
me
extremely
the
interest
is
enough
i
am
not
a
practical
man
i
am
not
a
philosopher
i
may
indeed
have
a
good
deal
of
the
poet
mind
but
the
poet
faculty
is
denied
to
me
it
only
remains
to
me
to
study
the
word
in
its
relations
to
my
personality
that
i
may
henceforth
avoid
the
absurdities
to
which
i
have
such
a
deplorable
leaning
you
know
what
i
ought
to
have
been
a
schoolmaster
that
is
to
say
if
i
wished
to
do
any
work
of
direct
good
to
my
fellows
in
the
world
i
could
have
taught
boys
well
better
than
i
shall
ever
do
anything
else
i
could
not
only
have
taught
them
the
of
thomas
carlyle
but
could
have
inspired
them
with
love
of
learning
at
all
events
such
as
were
capable
of
being
so
inspired
my
class
of
working
men
in
lambeth
exercised
this
faculty
to
some
extent
when
i
was
teaching
them
english
literature
i
was
doing
as
far
as
it
went
good
and
sound
work
when
i
drifted
into
for
the
present
heaven
forgive
me
i
made
an
ass
of
myself
that
the
long
and
short
of
it
my
ears
tingle
as
i
remember
those
evenings
am
infinitely
more
human
than
i
was
i
can
even
laugh
heartily
at
american
humour
and
that
i
take
to
be
a
sign
of
health
health
is
what
i
have
gained
the
devotion
of
eight
or
ten
hours
a
day
to
the
work
of
the
factory
has
been
the
best
medicine
any
one
could
have
prescribed
to
me
it
was
you
who
prescribed
it
and
it
was
your
crowning
act
of
kindness
to
me
dear
ormonde
it
is
possible
that
i
have
grown
coarser
indeed
i
know
that
i
associate
on
terms
of
equality
and
friendliness
with
men
from
whom
i
should
formerly
have
shrunk
i
can
get
angry
and
stand
on
my
rights
and
bluster
if
need
be
and
on
the
whole
i
think
i
am
no
worse
for
that
my
ear
is
not
offended
if
i
hear
myself
called
why
should
it
be
it
is
a
word
as
well
as
another
nay
i
have
even
felt
something
like
excitement
when
listening
to
political
speeches
in
which
frequent
mention
was
made
of
great
state
of
pennsylvania
well
it
a
great
state
or
the
phrase
has
no
meaning
in
any
application
will
not
this
early
life
of
the
new
world
some
day
be
studied
with
reverence
and
enthusiasm
i
try
to
see
things
as
they
are
problems
are
here
in
plenty
indeed
it
looks
very
much
as
if
america
would
sooner
have
reached
an
acute
stage
of
social
conflict
than
the
old
countries
naturally
as
it
is
the
refuge
of
these
who
abandon
the
old
world
in
disgust
american
equality
is
a
mere
phrase
there
is
as
much
brutal
injustice
here
as
elsewhere
but
i
can
no
longer
rave
on
the
subject
the
injustice
is
a
and
only
other
facts
will
replace
it
i
concern
myself
only
with
facts
and
the
great
fact
of
all
is
the
contemptibleness
of
average
humanity
i
will
submit
for
your
reverent
consideration
the
name
of
a
great
american
philanthropist
cornelius
vanderbilt
personally
he
was
a
disgusting
brute
ignorant
base
a
boor
in
his
manners
a
blackguard
in
his
language
he
had
little
if
any
natural
affection
and
to
those
who
offended
him
he
was
a
relentless
barbarian
yet
the
man
was
a
great
philanthropist
and
became
so
by
the
piling
up
of
millions
of
dollars
of
course
he
did
that
for
his
own
vulgar
satisfaction
though
personally
he
could
not
use
the
money
when
he
had
it
no
matter
he
has
aided
civilisation
enormously
he
as
good
as
created
the
steamship
industry
in
america
he
reorganised
the
railway
system
with
admirable
results
by
adding
so
much
to
the
circulating
capital
of
the
country
he
provided
employment
for
unnumbered
men
thousands
of
homes
should
bless
the
name
of
vanderbilt
and
what
is
the
state
of
a
world
in
which
such
a
man
can
do
such
good
by
such
means
well
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
it
it
is
merely
part
of
the
tremendous
present
which
interests
me
i
once
stood
up
in
my
pulpit
and
with
mild
assurance
addressed
myself
to
the
task
of
improving
the
world
do
not
make
fun
of
me
when
we
meet
again
dear
friend
i
am
too
bitterly
ashamed
of
myself
seems
a
long
time
since
you
told
me
anything
of
thyrza
i
do
not
like
to
receive
a
letter
from
you
in
which
there
is
no
mention
of
her
name
does
she
still
find
a
resource
in
her
music
are
you
still
kind
to
her
yes
kind
i
know
you
are
but
are
you
gentle
and
affectionate
doing
your
utmost
to
make
her
forget
that
she
is
alone
you
do
not
see
her
very
frequently
i
fear
i
beg
you
to
write
to
her
often
the
helpful
letters
you
can
write
to
those
whom
you
love
she
can
repay
you
for
all
trouble
with
one
look
of
gratitude
months
am
sending
you
whitman
of
grass
i
see
from
your
last
letter
that
you
have
not
yet
got
the
book
and
have
it
you
must
it
is
idle
to
say
that
you
can
not
take
up
new
things
that
you
doubt
whether
he
has
any
significance
for
and
so
on
you
have
heart
and
brain
therefore
his
significance
for
you
will
be
profound
would
not
write
much
about
him
hitherto
for
i
dreaded
the
smile
on
your
face
at
a
new
enthusiasm
i
wished
too
to
test
this
influence
upon
myself
thoroughly
i
assure
you
that
it
is
easier
for
me
now
to
be
sceptical
than
to
open
my
heart
generously
to
any
one
who
in
our
day
declares
himself
a
to
mankind
you
know
how
cautiously
i
have
proceeded
with
this
american
at
first
i
found
so
much
to
repel
me
yet
from
the
first
also
i
was
conscious
of
a
new
music
and
then
the
clamour
of
the
vulgar
against
the
man
was
quite
enough
to
oblige
me
to
give
him
careful
attention
if
one
goes
on
the
assumption
that
the
ill
word
of
the
mob
is
equivalent
to
high
praise
one
will
not
as
a
rule
be
far
wrong
in
matters
of
literature
i
have
studied
whitman
enjoyed
him
felt
his
force
and
his
value
and
speaking
with
all
seriousness
i
believe
that
he
has
helped
me
and
will
help
me
inestimably
in
my
endeavour
to
become
a
sound
and
mature
man
in
him
i
have
met
with
one
who
is
first
and
foremost
a
man
a
large
healthy
simple
powerful
man
bead
his
poem
called
song
of
joys
what
glorious
energy
of
delight
what
boundless
sympathy
what
what
he
knows
the
truth
of
the
life
that
is
in
all
things
from
joy
in
a
railway
train
laughing
locomotive
to
push
with
resistless
way
and
speed
off
in
the
distance
to
joy
in
fields
and
hillsides
joy
in
dropping
of
in
a
song
joy
in
the
fighter
strength
joy
in
the
life
of
the
fisherman
in
every
form
of
active
being
aye
and
joys
of
the
free
and
lonesome
heart
the
tender
gloomy
heart
joys
of
the
solitary
work
the
spirit
bow
yet
proud
the
suffering
and
the
struggle
the
agonistic
throes
the
ecstasies
joys
of
the
solemn
musings
day
or
night
joys
of
the
thought
of
death
the
great
spheres
time
and
space
what
would
not
i
give
to
know
the
completeness
of
manhood
implied
in
all
that
such
an
ideal
of
course
is
not
a
thing
for
me
but
i
never
it
as
in
whitman
work
it
is
so
foreign
to
my
own
habits
of
thought
i
have
always
been
so
narrow
in
a
sense
so
provincial
and
indeed
i
doubt
whether
whitman
would
have
appealed
to
me
as
he
now
does
had
i
read
him
for
the
first
time
in
england
and
under
the
old
conditions
these
fifteen
months
of
practical
business
life
in
america
has
swept
my
brain
of
much
that
was
mere
prejudice
even
when
i
thought
it
worship
i
was
a
pedantic
starveling
now
at
all
events
i
the
world
about
me
and
all
the
goodliness
of
it
then
i
am
far
healthier
in
body
than
i
was
which
goes
for
much
it
would
be
no
hardship
to
me
to
take
an
axe
and
go
off
to
labour
on
the
pacific
coast
nay
a
year
so
spent
would
do
me
a
vast
amount
of
good
wonder
whether
you
have
read
any
of
the
twaddle
that
is
written
about
whitman
grossness
his
materialism
and
so
forth
if
so
read
his
poems
now
and
tell
me
how
they
impress
you
is
he
not
spirit
rightly
understood
for
to
him
the
body
with
its
energies
is
but
manifestation
of
that
something
invisible
which
we
call
human
soul
and
so
pure
is
the
soul
in
him
so
mighty
so
tender
so
infinitely
sympathetic
that
it
may
stand
for
humanity
itself
i
am
often
moved
profoundly
by
his
words
he
makes
me
feel
that
i
am
a
very
part
of
the
universe
and
that
in
health
i
can
deny
kinship
with
nothing
that
exists
i
believe
that
he
for
the
first
time
has
spoken
with
the
very
voice
of
nature
forests
and
seas
sing
to
us
through
him
and
through
him
the
healthy
unconscious
man
average
man
utters
what
before
he
had
no
voice
to
tell
of
his
secret
aspirations
his
mute
love
and
praise
you
i
write
a
sort
of
essay
and
in
doing
so
prove
that
i
am
myself
still
were
it
not
that
i
have
mercy
on
you
i
could
preach
on
even
as
i
used
to
do
to
my
class
in
lambeth
ha
if
i
had
known
whitman
then
i
believe
that
by
persuading
those
men
to
read
him
and
helping
them
to
understand
him
i
should
really
have
done
an
honest
day
work
there
were
some
who
could
have
relished
his
meaning
and
whose
lives
he
would
have
helped
for
there
it
is
whitman
helps
one
he
is
a
tonic
beyond
all
to
be
found
in
the
druggist
shop
i
imagine
that
to
live
with
the
man
himself
for
a
few
days
would
be
the
best
thing
that
could
befall
an
invalid
surely
vital
force
would
come
out
of
him
makes
one
ashamed
to
groan
at
anything
whatever
comes
to
us
is
in
the
order
of
things
and
the
sound
man
accepts
it
as
his
lot
yes
even
death
of
which
he
says
noble
things
the
old
melodious
weeping
of
the
poets
moschus
over
his
mallows
and
catullus
with
his
occidere
et
redire
whitman
has
no
touch
of
that
noble
grief
there
is
in
him
and
noble
melancholy
can
come
upon
him
but
acquiescence
is
his
last
word
he
holds
that
all
is
good
because
it
exists
for
everything
plays
its
part
in
the
scheme
of
nature
when
his
day
comes
he
will
die
as
the
greatest
have
done
before
him
and
there
will
be
no
puny
repining
at
the
order
of
things
he
then
made
me
a
optimist
scarcely
for
the
willow
can
not
become
the
oak
your
old
name
for
me
was
idealist
and
i
suppose
in
a
measure
i
deserved
it
i
know
i
did
in
the
most
foolish
sense
of
the
word
and
in
my
idealism
was
of
course
implied
a
good
deal
of
optimism
but
shall
i
tell
you
what
was
there
in
a
yet
larger
measure
that
which
is
termed
an
enemy
speaking
of
me
now
dalmaine
for
example
if
he
chose
to
tell
the
truth
would
say
that
a
business
life
in
america
has
taken
a
great
deal
of
the
humbug
out
of
me
i
shall
always
be
rather
a
weak
mortal
shall
always
be
marked
by
that
blend
of
pessimism
and
optimism
which
necessarily
marks
the
man
to
whom
in
his
heart
the
beautiful
is
of
supreme
import
shall
always
be
prone
to
accesses
of
morbid
feeling
and
in
them
i
dare
say
find
after
all
my
highest
pleasure
nay
it
is
certain
that
moschus
and
gatullus
will
always
be
more
loved
by
me
than
whitman
for
all
this
i
am
not
what
i
was
and
i
am
a
completer
man
than
i
was
i
shall
remain
here
yet
nine
months
and
who
can
say
what
further
change
may
go
on
in
me
to
another
subject
it
gladdens
me
to
hear
what
you
say
of
thyrza
that
she
seems
both
well
and
happy
i
envy
you
the
delight
of
hearing
her
sing
it
is
a
beautiful
thing
that
in
this
way
she
has
found
expression
for
that
poetry
which
i
always
read
in
her
face
does
she
still
meet
her
sister
away
from
the
place
where
she
lives
is
that
still
necessary
however
all
these
details
are
in
your
judgment
the
great
thing
is
that
she
is
happy
in
her
life
that
she
has
found
a
great
interest
wish
to
know
i
beg
you
to
answer
me
whether
she
has
ever
spoken
of
me
when
i
used
to
press
you
to
speak
on
this
subject
you
always
ignored
that
part
of
my
letter
need
you
still
do
so
will
you
not
tell
me
whether
she
has
asked
about
me
has
spoken
in
any
way
of
me
to
be
sure
you
must
betray
no
confidences
yet
perhaps
it
will
not
be
doing
so
whitman
try
to
sympathise
with
me
as
i
now
am
you
know
that
i
am
anything
but
yet
in
very
truth
i
have
no
single
companion
here
to
whom
i
can
speak
of
intimate
things
and
except
on
business
i
write
absolutely
to
no
one
in
england
save
to
you
and
intellectual
sympathy
i
do
need
i
scarcely
think
i
could
live
on
through
my
life
without
it
thing
and
the
last
you
have
never
once
spoken
of
miss
newthorpe
nor
have
i
in
all
this
long
time
i
pray
you
tell
me
something
of
her
it
is
very
likely
that
she
married
to
whom
now
her
husband
should
be
an
interesting
man
one
i
should
like
some
day
to
know
or
is
she
another
example
of
the
unaccountable
things
women
will
do
in
marriage
pray
heaven
not
months
after
the
have
just
been
reading
a
leader
in
the
york
wherein
there
is
mention
of
dalmaine
factory
bill
dalmaine
is
spoken
of
with
extreme
respect
his
measure
is
one
of
those
which
testify
to
the
practical
wisdom
and
beneficence
of
the
spirit
which
prevails
in
british
legislation
this
kind
of
thing
it
is
says
the
writer
which
keeps
england
in
such
freedom
from
the
social
disturbance
so
rife
on
the
continent
of
europe
and
from
which
america
has
so
much
to
fear
seriously
this
is
all
very
right
and
just
dalmaine
is
deserving
well
of
his
country
but
the
amazing
fact
is
that
a
man
comes
forward
to
perform
such
services
however
it
is
only
the
vanderbilt
business
over
again
these
men
are
the
practical
philanthropists
and
to
sneer
at
them
is
very
much
the
same
as
to
speak
contemptuously
of
the
which
aids
the
growth
of
the
corn
have
written
very
short
letters
lately
business
has
claimed
me
night
and
day
we
have
had
sundry
difficulties
of
late
which
you
certainly
would
not
thank
me
for
explaining
and
i
am
only
just
beginning
to
feel
that
if
i
take
my
due
sleep
at
night
i
am
doing
nothing
wrong
for
months
i
have
been
the
man
of
business
pure
and
simple
i
have
exerted
myself
to
people
and
have
fumed
because
others
all
but
succeeded
in
me
i
have
lived
the
life
of
a
cunning
and
laborious
animal
well
i
have
my
profit
of
it
in
several
ways
but
i
think
i
have
had
about
enough
of
it
for
the
present
shall
be
in
england
in
a
month
i
shall
remain
there
long
is
uncertain
but
at
all
events
i
shall
not
be
back
here
again
for
some
time
one
of
our
london
men
is
coming
to
take
my
place
i
have
compliments
from
my
fellows
in
the
firm
it
makes
me
feel
that
i
must
have
sunk
low
now
to
the
subject
which
i
really
took
up
my
pen
to
write
about
i
am
very
glad
that
you
speak
of
letting
lydia
visit
her
sister
before
long
i
remember
well
how
much
they
are
to
each
other
it
has
been
no
less
than
heroism
in
thyrza
to
submit
to
practical
separation
for
so
long
a
time
at
your
mere
bidding
without
explanation
asked
or
given
you
speak
of
me
to
thyrza
before
my
return
no
i
suppose
you
will
take
no
such
responsibility
i
do
know
what
your
mind
is
now
on
this
matter
but
in
any
case
you
have
performed
your
part
right
generously
and
nobly
and
it
is
a
very
pleasant
thought
to
me
that
through
her
life
thyrza
will
regard
you
as
her
dearest
friend
the
one
to
whom
she
owes
most
it
will
be
a
source
of
sympathy
between
her
and
myself
you
think
she
my
coming
before
long
does
such
expectation
explain
her
constant
cheerfulness
otherwise
i
do
not
quite
understand
her
and
have
long
felt
it
a
difficulty
i
put
absolute
faith
in
all
you
tell
me
of
her
need
i
say
that
but
if
indeed
she
looks
forward
to
seeing
me
in
what
manner
has
she
conceived
that
hope
i
confess
i
did
not
think
that
her
nature
was
of
the
kind
which
can
derive
sufficient
support
from
hope
alone
hope
which
comes
of
mere
wish
it
would
be
so
very
different
if
any
word
had
even
passed
between
us
which
her
memory
could
store
up
as
encouragement
in
that
case
she
would
hope
on
for
years
her
own
fidelity
making
it
impossible
for
her
to
suspect
me
of
unfaithfulness
that
i
believe
is
in
her
character
you
remember
that
in
my
raving
i
accused
myself
to
you
and
said
that
i
was
conscious
of
having
allowed
her
to
read
my
thoughts
i
can
not
now
be
sure
whether
that
was
true
or
not
i
heartily
wish
i
could
still
i
am
sure
that
i
did
not
purposely
lead
her
to
think
i
was
in
love
with
her
and
as
things
turned
out
nothing
subsequently
happened
to
give
her
that
idea
at
all
events
nothing
i
ever
knew
of
true
i
made
confession
to
grail
but
he
would
not
have
spoken
of
it
to
thyrza
even
if
he
had
had
opportunity
which
you
are
convinced
he
has
not
and
you
say
it
is
equally
certain
that
lydia
trent
would
not
help
her
to
such
knowledge
we
can
only
conclude
that
the
fact
of
your
adopting
her
as
it
were
makes
her
hope
that
she
is
being
prepared
for
something
in
the
future
i
know
it
is
not
impossible
that
she
has
forgotten
me
in
the
lover
sense
i
am
not
so
conceited
as
to
believe
that
a
girl
who
has
once
conceived
a
liking
for
me
must
necessarily
hold
me
in
her
heart
for
ever
there
would
be
nothing
strange
certainly
nothing
unworthy
in
her
putting
away
all
thought
of
one
who
for
anything
she
knew
had
never
dreamed
of
loving
her
i
wonder
what
your
own
belief
is
but
do
not
write
about
this
i
shall
see
you
very
soon
i
mean
to
be
in
england
just
before
the
appointed
day
and
to
come
to
you
at
once
future
puzzles
me
a
little
at
times
and
yet
after
all
it
will
be
very
simple
when
a
man
marries
the
duties
of
life
are
suddenly
made
very
plain
formerly
it
was
my
incessant
question
what
ought
i
to
do
with
myself
with
my
time
with
my
money
and
of
course
being
what
i
am
and
living
in
our
age
i
drove
on
the
rocks
of
philanthropic
enterprise
no
more
risk
of
that
the
one
task
before
me
is
to
make
a
woman
as
happy
as
by
all
endeavour
i
may
to
think
of
nothing
in
this
world
until
her
heart
is
at
rest
to
sacrifice
everything
to
her
advancement
and
therein
easily
enough
to
find
my
own
happiness
the
circumstances
of
my
marriage
will
give
me
more
opportunity
of
making
this
aim
predominant
than
men
usually
have
thyrza
will
need
to
be
taught
much
and
will
be
eager
to
learn
i
think
i
shall
take
a
house
not
far
from
london
and
live
there
quietly
for
two
or
three
years
it
has
occurred
to
me
to
bring
her
here
but
i
had
rather
she
developed
her
intellectual
life
in
england
it
is
scarcely
probable
that
after
once
quitting
it
i
shall
return
to
this
humdrum
business
i
have
vast
arrears
to
make
up
in
all
my
natural
pursuits
and
with
thyrza
to
bear
me
company
in
the
fields
i
am
not
very
likely
to
go
back
of
my
own
will
to
a
factory
so
that
after
all
the
future
is
clear
enough
more
peaceful
and
more
fruitful
than
ever
the
past
was
you
will
often
come
to
us
will
you
not
it
will
be
a
joy
to
open
our
door
to
you
and
to
seat
you
at
our
table
and
in
the
evenings
thyrza
shall
sing
to
us
suppose
when
i
offer
myself
to
her
she
refuses
to
marry
me
is
it
possible
is
it
impossible
of
course
if
her
contentment
has
nothing
to
do
with
hope
of
seeing
me
again
then
my
appearance
will
only
surprise
and
alarm
and
trouble
her
must
rest
till
i
see
you
i
will
cable
from
new
york
when
i
am
starting
for
europe
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
england
again
glad
to
leave
trade
behind
me
thrice
glad
to
hold
your
hand
chapter
xxxvi
thyrza
waits
ca
promise
emerson
that
my
sister
will
come
down
and
have
tea
with
you
please
do
make
any
preparations
it
only
perhaps
thyrza
had
looked
into
the
to
say
this
late
in
the
evening
but
she
must
clara
pleaded
not
dear
wo
you
let
me
see
her
at
all
then
thyrza
closed
the
door
which
she
had
been
holding
open
and
advanced
into
the
room
she
wore
a
dress
of
light
hue
and
had
some
flowers
in
her
girdle
the
past
year
had
added
a
trifle
to
her
stature
it
could
not
add
to
her
natural
grace
but
her
manner
of
entering
showed
that
diffidence
had
been
overcome
by
habit
there
was
very
little
now
to
distinguish
her
from
the
young
lady
who
has
always
walked
on
carpets
wo
mind
if
i
ask
you
to
come
up
to
my
room
instead
mrs
emerson
she
said
standing
before
the
sofa
on
which
clara
sat
sewing
do
know
that
it
will
be
necessary
but
if
it
should
be
i
will
gladly
come
it
only
that
i
did
like
to
think
of
not
making
her
acquaintance
at
all
no
reason
why
i
should
explain
it
to
you
thyrza
said
holding
her
hands
together
sister
has
never
been
with
any
except
working
people
and
it
is
quite
natural
that
she
should
feel
a
little
afraid
of
meeting
strangers
i
sure
she
need
be
but
of
course
i
must
do
what
she
wishes
my
dear
surely
nobody
in
the
world
could
be
afraid
of
and
as
you
say
i
feel
certain
that
sister
need
be
afraid
of
any
one
i
come
up
and
see
her
and
we
talk
a
little
and
she
get
used
to
me
i
am
so
glad
she
is
coming
sure
you
are
and
how
well
you
look
dear
it
so
seldom
you
have
any
colour
in
your
cheeks
there
now
if
i
was
another
sort
of
person
you
go
away
thinking
i
said
that
on
purpose
to
hurt
you
could
i
thyrza
uttered
in
surprise
sort
of
people
would
have
that
thought
very
many
that
i
know
not
emerson
but
it
quite
true
my
cheeks
feel
a
little
hot
they
generally
do
when
i
been
making
myself
very
happy
about
anything
you
always
so
happy
more
than
you
are
thyrza
replied
laughing
i
think
you
show
it
more
when
i
happiest
i
sit
very
quiet
and
look
very
dull
now
you
sing
and
your
eyes
get
so
bright
and
large
you
do
know
how
large
your
eyes
look
sometimes
thyrza
laughed
and
shook
her
head
sing
too
much
she
said
i
do
mind
i
shall
be
hurting
my
voice
but
it
late
i
must
be
off
to
bed
and
i
know
i
sha
sleep
all
night
to
tell
the
truth
it
is
often
i
sleep
more
than
three
or
four
hours
emerson
happy
girl
she
went
away
laughing
in
pure
liquid
notes
her
light
step
could
not
be
heard
as
she
ran
up
the
stairs
it
wanted
but
a
week
of
the
day
to
which
thyrza
life
had
pointed
for
two
years
that
day
of
the
month
had
stood
long
since
marked
upon
her
calendar
and
now
the
long
months
had
annihilated
themselves
it
wanted
but
seven
days
external
changes
of
some
importance
had
come
to
her
of
late
since
her
admission
to
redfern
choir
she
no
longer
wrought
with
her
needle
more
than
that
every
other
day
there
came
a
lady
who
read
with
her
and
taught
her
the
time
of
weary
toil
without
assistance
was
over
she
had
never
been
able
to
seek
help
of
emerson
it
was
repugnant
to
her
to
speak
of
what
she
was
doing
in
secret
to
tell
of
her
efforts
would
have
seemed
to
thyrza
like
half
revealing
her
motives
so
closely
connected
in
her
own
mind
were
the
endeavour
and
its
hope
ormonde
had
known
but
hitherto
had
offered
no
direct
assistance
to
the
latter
thyrza
relation
was
a
strange
one
as
her
mind
matured
as
her
dreaming
gave
way
more
frequently
to
conscious
reflection
she
often
asked
herself
how
knowing
ormonde
thoughts
she
could
accept
from
her
so
much
and
repay
her
with
such
sincere
affection
told
to
her
of
another
she
could
with
difficulty
have
believed
it
yet
the
simple
truth
remained
that
she
had
never
shrunk
from
offers
of
kindness
had
never
felt
humiliated
in
receiving
anything
at
her
hands
this
could
not
have
been
but
for
the
sincerity
of
affection
on
ormonde
side
a
dialogue
such
as
that
which
thyrza
had
overheard
at
eastbourne
would
have
inspired
hatred
in
a
nature
less
pure
than
hers
she
had
wondered
had
at
times
thought
that
ormonde
misjudged
her
yet
such
was
the
simple
candour
of
her
mind
that
instead
of
fostering
evil
that
secret
knowledge
had
wrought
upon
her
in
the
most
beneficial
way
thinks
that
i
am
no
fit
wife
for
him
but
that
is
all
she
thinks
of
me
too
and
believes
that
he
could
not
make
me
happy
though
speaking
in
private
she
did
not
say
a
word
that
could
truly
offend
me
i
know
her
to
be
good
i
remember
what
she
was
by
my
bedside
when
i
was
ill
and
i
have
seen
numberless
things
that
prove
how
impossible
it
is
for
her
to
deceive
any
one
who
puts
trust
in
her
and
from
that
thyrza
derived
both
comfort
and
guidance
will
not
fear
her
perhaps
she
has
acted
in
the
wisest
and
kindest
way
to
him
who
loves
me
two
years
will
be
nothing
and
can
not
use
the
time
to
prove
to
her
that
i
am
worthy
to
be
his
wife
if
his
love
is
still
the
same
how
can
it
not
be
and
my
worthiness
is
put
beyond
doubt
she
can
have
no
further
reason
for
opposing
our
marriage
nay
she
will
be
glad
in
my
happiness
and
in
his
she
shall
see
that
i
can
bear
trial
that
i
can
work
quietly
and
perseveringly
above
all
that
i
am
faithful
and
time
made
the
affection
between
them
stronger
thyrza
believed
that
ormonde
opposition
to
the
marriage
was
weakening
when
at
length
as
the
time
drew
to
an
end
menial
work
was
put
aside
and
she
was
encouraged
to
spend
her
days
in
improving
her
mind
it
seemed
to
her
a
declaration
that
she
was
found
fit
for
a
higher
standing
than
that
to
which
she
was
born
the
joy
which
filled
her
became
almost
too
great
to
bear
she
no
longer
strove
to
conceal
it
in
presence
there
was
a
touching
little
scene
between
them
on
the
afternoon
before
the
concert
at
which
thyrza
was
to
sing
for
the
first
time
ormonde
came
to
thyrza
room
unannounced
the
latter
was
laying
out
the
dress
she
was
to
wear
in
the
evening
a
simple
white
dress
but
far
more
beautiful
than
any
she
had
ever
put
on
seeing
her
friend
enter
she
turned
looked
in
her
face
and
burst
into
tears
when
she
could
utter
words
they
were
a
passionate
expression
of
gratitude
ormonde
believed
in
that
moment
that
her
two
anxiety
had
found
its
end
very
shortly
after
came
the
permission
for
lydia
to
visit
her
it
was
new
assurance
that
ormonde
was
reconciled
to
what
she
had
tried
to
prevent
a
week
and
there
would
come
another
visitor
one
who
was
more
to
her
even
than
her
sister
in
looking
back
the
time
seemed
very
brief
for
whatever
change
had
been
made
in
her
the
love
which
was
her
life
life
had
known
no
shadow
of
change
had
it
perhaps
strengthened
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
she
could
love
more
than
in
that
day
of
her
darkest
misery
when
it
had
seemed
that
she
must
die
of
longing
for
him
to
whom
she
had
given
her
soul
yet
she
was
stronger
now
her
life
was
richer
in
a
multitude
of
ways
and
every
gain
she
had
achieved
paid
tribute
to
her
life
motive
her
singing
she
valued
most
as
a
way
of
uttering
the
emotion
she
must
not
speak
of
to
anyone
in
music
she
could
ease
herself
of
passion
yet
fear
no
surprisal
of
her
secret
nothing
was
a
joy
save
in
reference
to
that
one
end
that
was
before
her
if
she
felt
happy
in
a
piece
of
knowledge
attained
it
was
because
she
would
so
soon
speak
of
it
to
him
and
hear
him
praise
her
for
it
everything
and
all
people
about
her
seemed
to
conspire
for
her
happiness
even
the
bodily
pain
which
had
often
tried
her
so
was
no
longer
troublesome
or
very
seldom
indeed
emerson
might
well
call
her
girl
in
him
she
could
imagine
no
change
his
face
was
as
present
to
her
as
if
she
had
seen
him
an
hour
ago
and
she
never
asked
herself
whether
two
years
would
have
made
any
alteration
even
in
his
appearance
his
voice
was
the
voice
in
which
he
had
spoken
to
ormonde
when
he
uttered
the
golden
words
that
said
he
loved
her
he
would
speak
now
in
the
same
way
with
those
inflections
which
she
knew
so
well
dearer
music
than
any
she
had
learnt
or
could
learn
in
the
beginning
she
had
known
a
few
fears
time
then
was
so
long
so
long
before
her
but
what
had
she
to
do
with
fear
now
was
he
not
walter
egremont
the
man
of
all
men
the
good
wise
steadfast
she
had
heard
much
praise
of
him
in
the
old
days
but
never
praise
enough
no
one
knew
him
well
enough
no
one
the
half
as
well
as
she
did
should
she
not
know
him
who
dwelt
in
her
heart
his
life
had
always
been
strange
to
her
but
by
ceaseless
imagining
she
had
pictured
it
to
herself
so
completely
that
she
believed
she
could
follow
him
day
by
day
gilbert
grail
had
told
her
that
he
dwelt
in
a
room
full
of
books
near
the
british
museum
which
also
was
full
of
books
most
of
his
time
was
spent
in
study
she
understood
what
that
meant
he
did
not
give
lectures
now
that
had
come
miserably
to
an
end
he
had
a
few
friends
one
or
two
men
like
himself
who
thought
and
talked
of
high
and
wonderful
things
and
one
or
two
ladies
of
course
ormonde
and
perhaps
miss
newthorpe
but
probably
miss
newthorpe
was
married
now
and
indeed
he
did
not
care
much
to
talk
with
ladies
he
would
go
occasionally
out
of
london
as
he
used
to
perhaps
would
go
abroad
if
he
crossed
the
sea
he
must
think
much
of
her
for
the
sea
always
brings
thoughts
of
those
one
loves
and
so
he
lived
only
wishing
for
the
time
to
go
by
lydia
visit
was
on
sunday
she
was
to
come
immediately
after
dinner
and
perhaps
though
it
remained
uncertain
for
she
had
not
ventured
to
speak
of
it
in
her
letter
they
would
have
tea
with
the
emersons
concerning
thyrza
sister
emerson
had
much
curiosity
but
she
was
not
she
made
no
attempt
to
get
a
glimpse
of
lydia
as
the
latter
went
upstairs
to
thyrza
room
thyrza
stood
just
within
her
open
door
she
had
put
a
flower
in
her
hair
for
the
welcoming
this
is
where
you
have
lived
all
this
time
lydia
said
looking
about
the
room
pretty
it
is
thyrza
but
of
course
it
a
room
the
other
stood
with
her
hands
together
before
her
and
a
little
timidly
said
i
look
like
a
lady
suppose
you
did
know
me
lyddy
should
you
think
i
was
a
lady
course
i
should
her
sister
answered
though
in
a
way
which
showed
that
she
did
not
care
to
dwell
on
the
subject
still
thyrza
laughed
with
pleasure
do
you
think
i
love
my
sister
a
bit
the
less
course
i
do
lydia
was
not
quite
at
her
ease
not
at
all
sure
of
that
take
your
things
off
and
sit
down
in
that
chair
and
talk
to
me
as
if
we
were
in
the
old
room
at
home
i
must
see
our
room
again
lyddy
i
must
see
it
before
long
lydia
always
had
to
overcome
feelings
of
suspicion
and
remoteness
at
the
beginning
of
her
meetings
with
thyrza
time
had
not
changed
her
in
this
respect
she
still
feared
that
something
was
being
concealed
from
her
and
it
was
long
before
she
grew
sufficiently
accustomed
to
the
room
to
talk
with
freedom
thyrza
lost
all
hope
of
persuading
her
to
have
tea
with
the
emersons
she
was
obliged
to
broach
the
subject
however
and
it
excited
no
less
opposition
than
she
had
looked
for
lydia
shrank
from
the
thought
yet
when
thyrza
ceased
to
urge
and
even
exerted
herself
to
make
her
sister
forget
all
about
it
lydia
said
all
at
once
you
always
have
tea
with
them
on
sundays
but
it
does
make
the
least
difference
i
have
it
here
by
myself
other
days
and
i
can
do
just
as
i
like
about
it
do
trouble
dear
wo
be
anybody
except
those
two
no
there
never
is
lydia
changed
her
mind
much
as
she
disliked
meeting
strangers
and
sitting
at
their
table
she
felt
a
wish
to
see
these
people
with
whom
thyrza
lived
that
she
might
form
her
own
opinion
of
them
thyrza
much
delighted
ran
down
at
once
to
tell
emerson
having
made
up
her
mind
to
face
the
trial
lydia
went
through
it
as
might
have
been
expected
sensibly
and
becomingly
clara
made
much
of
her
emerson
at
home
for
once
was
languidly
polite
after
tea
thyrza
was
asked
to
sing
but
she
excused
herself
as
having
no
voice
her
real
reason
was
that
she
could
only
sing
songs
and
though
not
certain
she
thought
it
just
possible
that
lydia
might
dislike
that
kind
of
thing
on
sunday
however
the
good
lyddy
had
not
quite
reached
that
pass
the
sisters
went
upstairs
again
lydia
had
found
emerson
very
different
from
her
expectation
and
was
feeling
a
relief
she
talked
naturally
once
more
a
subject
of
much
interest
to
both
was
the
approaching
marriage
of
totty
nancarrow
is
it
certain
this
time
lyddy
quite
dear
the
names
are
up
in
the
registry
office
lydia
knew
nothing
of
totty
fortune
nor
did
any
one
else
in
lambeth
to
this
day
totty
and
her
husband
have
kept
that
a
secret
what
a
girl
totty
is
thyrza
exclaimed
she
used
to
declare
that
she
would
be
married
on
any
account
of
course
i
always
knew
that
was
all
nonsense
i
shall
go
and
see
her
some
day
lyddy
before
long
lydia
noticed
the
frequency
with
which
thyrza
spoke
of
shortly
seeing
old
places
and
old
friends
it
puzzled
her
but
she
asked
for
no
explanation
perhaps
all
these
mysteries
would
be
at
an
end
in
time
thyrza
found
it
very
hard
to
part
she
found
numberless
excuses
for
detaining
lydia
from
moment
to
moment
when
it
was
really
time
for
her
to
go
she
was
agitated
and
as
if
with
some
great
joy
sunday
at
the
same
time
lyddy
she
repeated
again
and
again
is
there
any
fear
of
me
forgetting
it
dearest
urged
her
sister
no
but
i
am
so
glad
for
you
to
come
here
you
like
coming
i
do
think
i
shall
write
to
you
in
the
week
but
of
course
write
if
there
anything
i
send
a
line
but
no
i
think
i
shall
it
be
such
a
short
time
till
sunday
wo
it
does
the
week
go
quickly
with
you
oh
we
say
it
getting
too
late
my
own
my
dearest
my
old
lyddy
think
of
me
every
hour
i
always
the
same
to
you
whatever
kind
of
dress
i
wear
you
know
that
do
you
dear
lyddy
she
clung
to
lydia
and
kissed
her
they
went
downstairs
together
then
before
opening
the
door
again
embraced
and
kissed
each
other
silently
when
a
few
yards
away
lydia
turned
thyrza
stood
on
the
light
from
within
the
house
shone
on
her
golden
hair
and
just
made
her
face
visible
she
was
kissing
her
hand
it
was
saturday
the
week
had
been
neither
long
nor
short
thyrza
could
not
distinguish
the
days
in
looking
back
upon
them
she
had
not
lived
in
time
but
in
the
eternity
of
a
rapturous
anticipation
her
daily
duties
had
been
performed
as
usual
but
with
as
little
consciousness
as
if
she
had
done
all
in
sleep
she
rose
and
it
was
saturday
morning
what
time
that
he
would
let
one
day
pass
had
never
occurred
to
her
as
a
possibility
but
perhaps
he
would
be
at
eastbourne
in
the
morning
and
in
that
case
she
must
wait
many
hours
happily
she
had
nothing
to
attend
to
today
she
could
not
even
have
pretended
to
live
her
wonted
life
emerson
would
be
out
till
evening
no
one
would
come
upstairs
to
disturb
about
trifles
she
pretended
to
breakfast
then
sat
down
by
the
window
she
was
fearful
now
not
for
the
event
but
of
her
own
courage
when
the
time
came
could
she
stand
before
him
in
what
words
could
she
speak
to
him
yet
she
must
not
let
him
doubt
what
her
two
years
had
been
would
it
be
right
to
tell
him
that
he
came
not
unexpected
to
confess
that
she
had
heard
him
when
he
spoke
to
ormonde
not
at
once
not
he
must
know
but
not
how
short
a
time
two
years
how
long
how
endlessly
long
each
hour
on
this
day
of
waiting
for
the
morning
passed
and
he
did
not
come
he
was
at
eastbourne
he
had
not
even
asked
ormonde
to
keep
her
word
till
the
very
day
came
her
dinner
was
brought
up
and
was
sent
down
again
untouched
she
sat
still
at
the
window
every
wheel
that
approached
made
her
heart
leap
its
dull
rumbling
into
the
distance
sickened
her
with
disappointment
but
most
likely
he
would
walk
to
the
house
and
then
she
would
not
know
till
the
servant
came
up
to
tell
her
why
had
she
not
thought
to
get
a
that
she
might
know
all
the
trains
from
eastbourne
she
could
not
now
go
out
to
purchase
one
he
would
come
in
her
absence
it
drew
to
evening
thyrza
knew
neither
hunger
nor
thirst
she
did
not
even
feel
weary
dread
was
creeping
upon
her
she
fought
with
it
resolutely
she
would
be
no
traitor
to
herself
to
him
her
other
self
he
might
very
well
leave
it
till
evening
to
make
sure
of
her
being
at
home
her
mind
racked
her
with
absurd
doubts
had
she
mistaken
this
the
day
pale
and
cold
as
marble
whilst
the
evening
twilight
died
upon
her
face
she
did
not
move
better
to
sit
so
still
that
she
forgot
impatience
perchance
forgot
time
the
vehicles
in
the
street
were
fewer
now
her
as
each
drew
near
were
the
more
violent
nor
would
the
inward
pulse
recover
its
quietness
when
there
was
silence
she
heard
it
always
she
felt
it
as
an
unceasing
pain
why
should
she
rise
and
light
the
lamp
if
he
did
not
come
what
matter
if
she
sat
in
darkness
and
pain
for
ever
and
the
long
summer
evening
did
in
truth
become
night
the
street
grew
yet
more
quiet
she
saw
the
moon
very
clear
and
beautiful
there
sounded
a
loud
at
the
street
door
she
sprang
up
and
stood
listening
it
was
a
visitor
to
the
emersons
even
when
assured
of
that
something
in
her
would
not
believe
it
hoped
against
conviction
but
at
length
she
went
back
to
her
chair
no
tears
but
the
pain
harder
to
bear
than
ever
she
awoke
at
very
early
morning
she
was
lying
on
her
bed
fully
clad
there
was
a
dread
in
her
mind
at
waking
and
in
a
few
moments
she
recognised
it
lydia
was
coming
would
it
be
possible
to
sit
and
talk
with
her
only
by
clinging
with
stern
determination
to
the
last
hope
something
had
rendered
it
impossible
for
him
to
come
yesterday
and
he
was
not
likely
to
come
no
not
but
there
was
always
the
morrow
by
refusing
to
think
of
anything
but
the
morrow
she
might
bear
presence
sunday
monday
and
now
it
was
tuesday
at
dawn
thyrza
had
but
one
thought
in
her
mind
ormonde
was
treacherous
she
had
broken
her
promise
he
was
wishing
to
come
to
her
and
knew
not
where
she
was
lydia
would
not
tell
him
lydia
too
was
pitiless
she
had
sat
still
in
her
room
since
sunday
night
she
had
pleaded
illness
to
avoid
all
visits
and
all
occupation
whether
really
ill
or
no
she
could
not
say
yes
there
was
the
pain
but
she
had
become
so
used
to
that
she
only
knew
that
the
days
and
the
nights
were
endless
that
she
no
longer
needed
to
eat
that
the
sunlight
was
burdensome
to
her
eyes
clara
had
been
troublesome
with
her
solicitude
it
had
needed
an
almost
angry
word
to
secure
privacy
at
thyrza
took
up
the
which
she
had
procured
and
sought
for
something
in
its
pages
then
she
began
to
attire
herself
for
going
out
she
looked
into
her
purse
in
a
few
minutes
she
went
quietly
down
the
stairs
as
if
for
an
ordinary
walk
and
left
the
house
chapter
xxxvii
a
friendly
office
on
the
friday
when
thyrza
in
her
happiness
had
said
he
comes
ormonde
also
was
thinking
of
a
visitor
who
might
arrive
at
any
hour
nine
days
ago
she
had
received
a
telegram
from
new
york
informing
her
that
walter
egremont
was
there
and
about
to
embark
for
england
she
too
avoided
leaving
the
house
her
impatience
and
nervousness
were
greater
than
she
had
thought
such
an
event
as
this
could
cause
her
but
it
was
years
now
since
she
had
begun
to
accept
walter
in
the
place
of
her
own
dead
son
and
in
that
spirit
she
desired
his
return
from
the
exile
of
twice
twelve
months
it
was
with
joy
that
she
expected
him
though
with
one
uncertainty
which
would
give
her
trouble
now
and
then
a
doubt
which
was
she
felt
shadowy
which
the
first
five
minutes
of
talk
would
put
away
she
had
dined
and
was
thinking
that
it
was
now
too
late
to
expect
an
arrival
when
the
arrival
itself
was
announced
gentleman
asks
if
you
will
see
him
said
the
servant
egremont
will
see
him
he
came
quickly
to
her
over
the
carpet
and
they
clasped
hands
then
as
he
heard
the
door
close
walter
kissed
the
hand
he
held
kissed
it
twice
with
affection
they
did
not
speak
at
first
but
looked
at
each
other
ormonde
eyes
shone
strong
and
well
you
look
were
her
first
words
bring
a
breath
from
the
atlantic
from
a
pestilent
english
railroad
car
say
and
walter
i
confused
a
cabman
at
liverpool
by
talking
the
he
laughed
merrily
a
stronger
and
deeper
laugh
than
of
old
personally
he
was
not
however
much
changed
he
was
still
shaven
still
stood
in
the
same
attitude
his
smile
was
still
the
same
inscrutable
movement
of
the
features
but
his
natural
wiriness
had
become
somewhat
more
pronounced
and
the
on
his
cheeks
prepared
one
for
a
robuster
kind
of
speech
from
him
than
formerly
course
you
have
not
dined
let
me
go
away
for
one
moment
thank
you
foreseeing
this
i
dined
at
the
station
you
behaved
with
much
unkindness
stand
with
your
face
rather
more
to
the
light
yes
you
are
strong
and
well
i
shall
not
say
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
perhaps
i
should
have
done
if
you
had
waited
to
break
bread
under
my
roof
shall
sit
down
if
i
may
this
journey
from
liverpool
has
tired
me
much
oh
yes
i
was
glad
as
i
came
through
the
midlands
it
was
poetry
again
even
amid
smoke
and
ashes
you
must
not
deny
your
gods
poetry
of
a
different
kind
from
whitman
to
tennyson
and
one
an
english
home
grey
twilight
poured
no
i
deny
nothing
one
moods
alter
with
the
scene
find
that
newthorpe
has
good
words
for
your
whitman
course
he
has
what
man
of
literary
judgment
has
not
he
is
here
still
at
present
they
went
a
fortnight
ago
to
ullswater
stay
there
till
winter
i
suppose
till
late
in
autumn
walter
did
not
keep
his
seat
in
spite
of
the
fatigue
he
had
spoken
of
in
a
minute
or
two
he
was
moving
about
the
room
glancing
at
a
picture
or
an
ornament
photograph
is
new
i
think
he
said
raphael
del
sarto
that
i
am
i
should
have
known
lucrezia
face
and
your
poor
little
girls
i
was
grieved
to
hear
of
the
death
of
bunce
child
i
always
think
of
poor
bunce
as
a
man
came
a
month
ago
to
see
bessie
grave
he
talked
to
me
in
a
very
human
way
and
things
are
better
with
him
pray
sit
down
no
there
is
nothing
else
new
in
the
room
he
seemed
to
obey
with
reluctance
his
eyes
still
strayed
ormonde
kept
a
subdued
smile
and
did
her
best
to
talk
with
ease
of
matters
connected
with
his
voyage
and
the
like
walter
replies
grew
briefer
he
said
at
last
two
years
come
to
an
end
do
ormonde
joined
her
hands
upon
her
lap
she
avoided
his
look
have
you
to
tell
me
of
thyrza
he
went
on
to
ask
his
voice
becoming
grave
did
you
see
her
recently
she
is
well
and
very
cheerful
so
cheerful
you
will
tell
me
now
where
she
is
she
looked
him
steadily
in
the
face
wish
to
know
walter
have
come
to
england
to
ask
it
i
will
tell
you
and
she
named
the
address
walter
made
a
note
of
it
in
his
now
will
you
also
tell
me
fully
about
her
life
since
i
went
away
i
should
like
to
know
with
whom
she
has
been
living
exactly
how
she
has
spent
her
time
of
business
ormonde
tried
to
jest
but
did
it
nervously
i
seem
to
you
than
i
used
to
be
a
man
of
the
world
at
all
events
no
not
fallen
off
in
the
way
you
mean
but
i
think
you
judge
more
soberly
about
grave
matters
i
think
you
know
yourself
better
better
if
i
am
not
mistaken
still
can
have
tete
on
occasion
still
think
of
many
things
in
the
idealist
fashion
sincerely
hope
so
of
everything
i
trust
make
great
sacrifices
for
an
imaginary
obligation
he
left
his
seat
again
ormonde
was
agitated
and
both
kept
silence
for
some
moments
grieves
me
that
you
say
that
walter
spoke
at
length
earnestly
obligation
of
mine
is
far
from
imaginary
that
is
not
very
like
yourself
mrs
ormonde
can
not
speak
so
clearly
as
i
should
like
to
walter
i
too
have
my
troublesome
thoughts
us
go
back
to
my
questioning
tell
me
everything
about
her
from
the
day
when
you
decided
what
to
do
will
you
and
hide
nothing
whatever
that
i
know
for
a
long
time
her
narrative
broken
by
questioning
continued
egremont
listened
with
earnest
countenance
often
looking
pleased
at
the
end
he
said
have
done
a
good
work
i
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
you
owe
me
thanks
ormonde
returned
quietly
perhaps
you
give
them
for
a
mistaken
reason
what
you
have
told
me
of
the
growth
of
her
character
there
is
nothing
that
i
did
not
foresee
it
is
good
to
know
that
even
then
i
was
under
no
foolish
illusion
but
the
circumstances
were
needed
and
you
have
supplied
them
how
can
i
be
mistaken
in
thanking
you
for
having
so
tended
her
who
is
to
be
my
wife
walter
you
foresaw
into
what
she
might
develop
it
is
true
and
it
enables
us
to
regard
the
past
without
too
much
sadness
did
you
foresee
her
perfect
equanimity
when
once
she
had
settled
down
to
a
new
life
he
said
hesitatingly
that
she
had
taken
such
a
desperate
step
purely
through
love
of
you
you
thought
it
more
than
likely
that
she
would
live
on
in
great
unhappiness
cheerfulness
surprises
me
but
it
is
impossible
to
offer
an
explanation
she
has
foreseen
what
is
now
going
to
happen
she
knows
you
are
my
friend
she
sees
that
you
are
giving
great
pains
to
raise
her
from
her
former
standing
in
life
what
more
likely
than
that
she
explains
it
all
by
guessing
the
truth
and
so
her
cheerfulness
is
the
most
hopeful
sign
for
me
is
plausible
but
you
are
mistaken
long
ago
i
talked
to
her
with
much
seriousness
of
all
her
future
i
spoke
of
the
chances
of
her
being
able
to
earn
a
living
with
her
voice
and
purposely
discouraged
any
great
hope
in
that
direction
her
needlework
and
what
she
had
been
trained
to
at
the
home
were
i
showed
her
likely
to
be
her
chief
resources
i
have
even
tested
her
on
the
subject
of
her
returning
to
live
with
her
sister
has
overcome
all
these
considerations
you
kept
her
sister
from
knowing
where
she
was
why
if
there
was
not
some
idea
of
severing
her
from
her
old
associations
explained
it
to
her
in
one
of
our
talks
i
showed
her
that
her
rashness
had
made
it
very
difficult
to
aid
her
spoke
of
me
to
her
as
i
have
told
you
nor
has
she
ever
mentioned
you
i
pointed
out
to
her
that
of
course
i
could
not
explain
the
state
of
things
to
the
emersons
and
therefore
lydia
had
better
not
visit
her
for
some
time
egremont
sat
down
at
a
distance
and
brooded
a
contradiction
is
involved
he
exclaimed
presently
can
a
girl
of
her
character
have
forgotten
so
quickly
such
profound
emotion
must
not
forget
that
weeks
passed
between
my
finding
her
and
her
going
to
live
with
the
emersons
during
all
that
time
the
poor
girl
was
wretched
enough
cheerfulness
only
came
with
time
after
that
it
is
your
conviction
that
she
has
absolutely
put
me
out
of
her
mind
that
she
has
found
sufficient
happiness
in
the
progress
she
has
felt
herself
to
be
making
is
my
firm
belief
her
character
is
not
so
easy
to
read
as
newspaper
she
can
suffer
i
think
even
more
than
most
women
but
she
has
too
far
more
strength
than
most
women
a
mind
of
a
higher
order
purer
consolations
and
she
has
art
to
aid
her
a
resource
you
and
i
can
not
judge
of
with
assurance
walter
looked
up
and
said
are
describing
a
woman
who
might
be
the
most
refined
man
ideal
think
so
admit
that
thyrza
is
in
every
way
more
than
fit
to
be
my
wife
will
admit
that
walter
i
am
astonished
at
your
tone
in
speaking
of
what
i
mean
to
do
have
asked
me
two
questions
said
ormonde
her
face
alight
with
conviction
answer
two
of
mine
is
this
woman
worthy
of
a
man
entire
love
he
hesitated
but
answered
affirmatively
have
you
that
entire
love
to
give
her
walter
the
truth
for
she
is
very
dear
to
me
in
her
room
in
london
thyrza
sat
and
said
to
herself
he
comes
he
answered
have
not
ormonde
said
a
slight
flush
in
her
cheeks
can
you
express
surprise
at
what
i
do
a
long
silence
fell
walter
brooded
something
of
shame
on
his
face
from
that
confession
then
he
came
to
ormonde
side
and
took
her
hand
are
incapable
he
said
gently
conscious
injustice
had
you
said
nothing
of
this
to
me
i
should
have
gone
to
thyrza
and
have
asked
her
to
marry
me
she
would
not
have
refused
even
granting
that
her
passion
has
gone
you
know
she
would
not
refuse
me
and
you
know
too
that
i
could
enrich
her
life
abundantly
my
passion
too
is
over
but
i
know
well
that
love
for
such
a
woman
as
she
is
would
soon
awake
in
me
i
do
not
think
i
should
do
her
any
injustice
if
i
asked
her
to
be
my
wife
shall
i
be
unjust
to
her
if
i
withhold
ormonde
did
not
answer
at
once
she
retained
his
hand
and
her
own
showed
how
strongly
she
felt
i
think
it
would
be
unjust
to
her
if
you
asked
her
remembering
her
present
mind
it
is
not
only
that
your
passion
for
her
is
dead
you
think
of
another
woman
is
true
but
i
do
not
love
her
she
smiled
are
not
ready
to
behave
crazily
about
her
no
but
i
believe
that
you
love
her
in
a
truer
sense
than
you
ever
loved
thyrza
you
love
her
mind
not
thyrza
a
mind
do
not
know
it
walter
i
doubt
whether
you
would
ever
know
it
recall
a
letter
you
wrote
to
me
in
which
you
dissected
your
own
character
it
was
frank
and
in
a
very
great
measure
true
you
are
not
the
husband
for
thyrza
place
thyrza
above
annabel
newthorpe
it
was
asked
almost
indignantly
so
that
ormonde
smiled
and
raised
her
hand
it
is
clear
resent
it
he
reddened
ormonde
continued
compare
them
merely
i
do
think
thyrza
will
find
the
husband
who
is
worthy
of
her
but
i
think
it
likely
that
she
will
win
more
love
than
you
could
ever
give
her
i
have
told
you
that
she
is
dear
to
me
to
you
i
would
give
a
daughter
of
my
own
with
entire
confidence
for
you
are
human
and
of
noble
impulses
but
i
do
not
wish
you
to
marry
thyrza
yes
you
read
my
thought
it
is
not
solely
the
question
of
love
i
wish
you
i
have
so
long
wished
you
to
marry
annabel
to
thyrza
you
do
not
the
least
injustice
by
withholding
your
offer
she
is
happy
without
you
you
are
entirely
free
to
consult
your
own
highest
interests
if
i
counsel
wrongly
the
blame
is
mine
but
walter
you
must
after
all
decide
for
yourself
it
is
a
most
hazardous
part
this
that
i
am
playing
at
least
it
would
be
if
i
did
not
see
the
facts
of
the
case
so
clearly
rest
till
then
let
us
sneak
again
shall
it
be
so
egremont
left
the
chestnuts
and
walked
along
the
shore
in
moonlight
his
mind
had
received
a
shock
and
the
sense
of
disturbance
affected
him
physically
he
was
obliged
to
move
rapidly
to
breathe
the
air
he
had
left
america
with
fixity
of
purpose
his
plain
duty
was
to
go
to
thyrza
and
ask
her
to
marry
him
be
her
position
what
it
might
his
own
was
clear
enough
he
looked
forward
with
a
certain
pleasure
to
the
mere
discharge
of
so
plain
an
obligation
ormonde
had
studiously
refrained
from
expressing
any
thought
with
regard
to
the
future
in
her
letters
he
quite
expected
that
she
would
repeat
to
him
with
a
certain
emphasis
the
fact
of
thyrza
present
cheerfulness
but
he
did
not
anticipate
serious
opposition
to
the
course
he
had
decided
upon
practically
thyrza
had
lived
in
preparation
for
a
life
of
refinement
ormonde
he
concluded
knew
that
he
could
act
but
in
one
way
and
though
refusing
to
do
so
ostensibly
had
in
fact
been
removing
the
rougher
difficulties
her
attitude
now
surprised
him
made
him
uneasy
yet
he
knew
his
own
inability
to
resist
her
he
knew
that
she
spoke
on
the
side
of
his
secret
hope
he
knew
that
a
debate
which
had
long
gone
on
within
himself
to
himself
unavowed
had
at
length
to
find
its
issue
his
passion
for
thyrza
was
dead
he
even
wondered
how
it
could
ever
have
been
so
violent
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
scarcely
knew
her
could
he
not
count
on
his
fingers
the
number
of
times
that
he
had
seen
her
so
much
had
intervened
between
him
and
her
between
himself
as
he
was
then
and
his
present
self
it
was
with
apprehension
that
he
thought
of
marrying
her
he
knew
what
miseries
had
again
and
again
resulted
from
marriages
such
as
this
and
he
feared
for
her
quite
as
much
as
for
himself
for
there
was
no
more
passion
neither
on
her
side
it
seemed
was
not
ormonde
right
was
it
not
to
incur
a
wholly
needless
risk
and
suppose
the
risk
were
found
to
be
an
imaginary
one
what
was
the
profit
likely
to
be
to
each
of
them
but
as
often
as
he
accepted
what
he
held
to
be
the
common
sense
of
the
case
something
unsettled
him
again
the
one
passion
of
his
life
had
been
for
thyrza
he
called
it
dead
does
not
one
mourn
over
such
a
death
he
would
not
have
recourse
to
the
old
dishonesty
and
say
that
his
love
had
been
folly
was
it
not
rather
the
one
golden
memory
he
had
was
it
not
of
infinite
significance
one
loves
a
woman
madly
and
she
gives
proof
of
such
unworthiness
that
love
is
killed
why
even
then
the
dead
thing
was
inestimably
precious
one
would
not
forget
it
and
thyrza
was
no
woman
of
this
kind
she
had
developed
since
he
knew
her
ormonde
spoke
of
her
as
few
can
be
justly
spoken
of
was
it
good
to
let
the
love
for
such
a
woman
pass
away
when
perchance
the
sight
of
her
would
revive
it
and
make
it
lasting
the
stars
and
the
night
wind
and
the
breaking
of
the
sea
the
sea
which
thyrza
loved
spoke
to
him
could
he
not
understand
their
language
on
monday
morning
he
took
the
train
to
london
thence
northwards
a
visit
to
the
newthorpes
after
two
years
of
absence
was
natural
enough
chapter
xxxviii
the
truth
ormonde
was
successful
but
success
did
not
bring
her
unmixed
content
she
was
persuaded
that
what
she
had
done
was
wholly
prudent
that
in
years
to
come
she
would
look
back
on
this
chapter
of
her
life
with
satisfaction
yet
for
the
present
she
could
not
get
rid
of
a
shapeless
misgiving
this
little
centre
of
trouble
in
the
mind
was
easily
enough
accounted
for
granted
that
thyrza
could
live
quite
well
without
walter
egremont
it
was
none
the
less
true
that
in
losing
him
she
lost
a
certainty
of
happiness
and
does
happiness
grow
on
every
thicket
that
one
can
afford
to
pass
it
lightly
the
fear
lest
egremont
should
reap
misery
from
such
a
marriage
and
cause
misery
in
turn
was
no
longer
seriously
to
be
entertained
it
could
not
now
have
justified
interference
had
there
been
nothing
else
that
did
so
ormonde
could
not
rob
thyrza
thus
without
grieving
but
it
was
the
happiness
of
two
against
that
of
one
and
however
monstrous
the
dogma
that
one
should
be
sacrificed
even
to
a
million
such
a
consideration
is
wont
to
have
weight
with
us
when
we
are
arguing
with
our
conscience
and
getting
somewhat
the
worst
of
it
ormonde
felt
sure
that
annabel
newthorpe
would
not
now
reject
walter
if
he
again
offered
himself
many
things
had
given
proof
of
that
annabel
knew
that
thyrza
had
thoroughly
outlived
her
trouble
she
knew
moreover
that
egremont
had
never
in
reality
compromised
himself
in
regard
to
her
in
her
eyes
then
the
latter
was
rather
the
victim
of
misfortune
than
himself
culpable
if
walter
eventually
of
course
some
time
must
pass
again
sought
to
win
her
without
doubt
he
would
tell
her
everything
and
annabel
would
find
nothing
in
the
story
to
make
a
perpetual
barrier
between
them
the
marriage
which
ormonde
so
strongly
desired
would
still
come
about
on
the
other
hand
in
spite
of
arguments
that
seemed
irresistible
she
could
not
dismiss
the
question
does
thyrza
know
anything
of
passion
that
she
could
know
anything
of
the
compact
which
had
run
its
two
years
was
of
course
impossible
but
walter
persistence
in
urging
that
if
once
she
had
learnt
his
love
for
her
that
together
with
the
circumstances
of
her
life
would
make
sufficient
ground
for
hope
this
persistence
had
impressed
ormonde
in
a
second
long
conversation
the
subject
had
been
gone
over
point
by
point
for
a
second
time
harm
come
ormonde
said
to
herself
am
indeed
to
blame
for
though
his
wishes
oppose
it
i
had
but
to
show
doubt
and
he
would
have
taken
the
manly
part
and
have
gone
to
thyrza
she
did
not
seek
to
defend
herself
by
saying
as
she
might
well
have
done
that
throughout
he
encouraged
her
in
her
resistance
he
was
of
firmer
substance
than
two
years
ago
yet
had
not
become
nor
ever
would
a
vigorously
independent
man
in
her
hands
the
decision
had
lain
and
the
affair
was
decided
on
tuesday
the
day
after
egremont
departure
for
the
north
of
england
she
was
still
thinking
these
thoughts
at
four
in
the
afternoon
having
seen
her
children
come
in
from
the
garden
and
gather
for
tea
she
went
with
a
book
to
spend
an
hour
in
the
arbour
where
she
had
had
that
fateful
conversation
with
walter
on
the
summer
night
as
she
drew
near
to
the
covered
spot
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
a
footfall
behind
on
the
grass
she
turned
her
head
and
with
surprise
saw
thyrza
with
something
more
than
surprise
as
she
looked
in
thyrza
face
that
slight
uneasiness
in
her
mind
changed
to
a
dark
misgiving
and
from
that
to
the
certainty
of
fear
thyrza
had
never
regarded
her
thus
and
she
herself
had
never
seen
features
so
passionately
the
book
fell
from
her
hand
she
could
not
utter
a
greeting
want
to
speak
to
you
mrs
ormonde
in
here
thyrza
why
have
you
come
what
has
happened
she
drew
back
under
the
shelter
of
trellis
and
thyrza
followed
ormonde
met
the
searching
eyes
and
compassion
helped
her
to
she
could
not
doubt
what
the
first
words
spoken
would
be
yet
the
mystery
of
the
scene
was
inscrutable
to
her
want
to
ask
you
about
egremont
thyrza
said
resting
her
trembling
hand
on
the
little
rustic
table
want
to
know
where
he
is
prepared
as
she
had
been
the
words
really
spoken
struck
ormonde
with
new
consternation
the
voice
was
not
thyrza
it
had
no
sweetness
but
was
like
the
voice
of
one
who
had
suffered
long
exhaustion
who
speaks
with
difficulty
i
will
tell
you
where
he
is
thyrza
the
other
replied
her
own
accents
shaken
with
sympathy
do
you
wish
to
hear
of
mr
egremont
think
you
need
ask
me
that
mrs
ormonde
i
must
ask
i
ca
understand
why
you
should
come
like
this
thyrza
i
ca
understand
what
has
happened
to
make
this
change
in
you
since
i
saw
you
last
ormonde
you
do
understand
why
should
you
pretend
with
me
you
know
that
i
have
been
waiting
waiting
since
saturday
thyrza
spoke
as
if
there
were
no
mystery
in
her
having
attached
a
hope
to
that
particular
day
all
but
distraught
as
she
was
she
made
no
distinction
between
the
mere
fact
of
her
abiding
love
which
she
could
not
conceive
that
ormonde
was
ignorant
of
and
the
incident
of
her
having
surprised
a
secret
saturday
ormonde
repeated
did
you
wait
for
on
saturday
she
had
a
wretched
suspicion
from
egremont
alone
that
information
could
have
come
to
thyrza
had
he
played
detestably
false
having
by
some
means
at
the
height
of
his
passion
communicated
with
the
girl
but
the
thought
could
only
pass
through
her
mind
it
would
not
bear
the
light
of
reason
for
a
moment
impossible
for
him
to
speak
and
act
so
during
these
past
days
knowing
that
his
dishonesty
was
certain
of
being
discovered
impossible
to
attach
such
suspicion
to
him
at
all
expected
to
see
him
thyrza
replied
knew
he
was
to
come
in
two
years
i
have
waited
all
the
time
and
now
he
has
not
come
i
heard
she
checked
herself
and
looked
at
the
trellis
at
the
back
of
the
she
understood
now
that
it
was
needful
to
explain
her
knowledge
heard
thyrza
night
that
he
was
here
i
had
walked
to
look
at
your
house
i
was
going
home
again
when
he
passed
me
he
did
see
me
and
went
into
the
garden
i
could
go
back
at
once
i
had
to
sit
down
and
rest
it
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
leaves
she
pointed
sat
down
there
without
knowing
he
would
be
here
and
i
should
hear
him
talking
to
you
i
heard
all
you
said
about
the
two
years
i
have
been
waiting
for
him
to
come
ormonde
could
not
reply
what
words
would
express
what
she
felt
in
learning
this
thyrza
eyes
were
still
fixed
upon
her
want
you
to
tell
me
where
he
is
mrs
ormonde
it
was
a
summons
that
could
not
be
avoided
here
thyrza
i
will
tell
you
sit
down
and
let
me
speak
to
you
no
tell
me
now
why
not
why
should
i
sit
down
what
is
there
to
say
the
words
were
not
weakly
complaining
but
of
passionate
insistence
thyrza
believed
that
ormonde
was
preparing
to
elude
her
was
shaping
excuses
her
eyes
watched
the
other
every
movement
keenly
with
fear
and
hostility
she
felt
within
reach
of
her
desire
yet
held
back
by
this
woman
from
attaining
it
every
instant
of
silence
heightened
the
maddening
tumult
of
her
heart
and
brain
she
had
suffered
so
terribly
since
saturday
it
seemed
as
if
her
gentleness
her
patience
were
converted
into
their
opposites
which
now
ruled
her
tyrannously
egremont
is
not
in
london
ormonde
said
at
last
she
dreaded
the
result
of
any
word
she
might
say
she
was
asking
herself
whether
walter
ought
not
to
be
summoned
back
at
once
was
it
too
late
for
that
in
london
then
where
you
saw
him
on
saturday
i
saw
him
you
would
not
tell
him
where
i
was
ormonde
you
spoke
like
you
did
that
night
you
persuaded
him
not
to
come
to
me
when
i
was
waiting
i
forgave
you
for
what
you
said
before
but
now
you
have
done
something
that
i
shall
never
forgive
nothing
you
can
say
will
make
me
forgive
you
your
kindness
to
me
has
been
kindness
at
all
it
was
all
to
separate
me
from
him
what
have
you
told
him
about
me
you
have
said
i
do
think
of
him
any
more
you
made
him
believe
i
was
fit
for
him
and
now
you
will
refuse
to
tell
me
where
he
is
ormonde
took
the
girl
hands
forcibly
in
her
own
and
held
them
against
her
breast
she
was
pale
and
overcome
with
emotion
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
do
force
yourself
to
be
calmer
so
that
you
can
listen
to
me
hold
my
hands
ormonde
i
have
loved
you
but
i
pretend
to
now
that
you
have
done
this
against
me
i
will
listen
to
you
but
how
shall
i
believe
what
you
say
i
did
think
one
woman
could
be
so
cruel
to
another
as
you
have
been
to
me
you
do
know
what
it
means
to
wait
as
i
have
waited
if
you
knew
you
never
have
done
this
you
would
have
had
the
heart
to
do
this
to
me
poor
child
think
think
could
i
know
that
you
were
waiting
you
forget
that
you
have
only
just
told
me
your
secret
for
the
first
time
i
have
seen
you
always
so
full
of
life
and
gladness
and
how
was
i
to
dream
of
this
sudden
change
thyrza
listened
and
as
if
imperfectly
comprehending
examined
the
speaker
face
in
silence
am
not
the
cruel
woman
you
call
me
ormonde
went
on
had
no
idea
that
your
happiness
depended
upon
meeting
with
egremont
again
had
no
idea
of
that
thyrza
asked
slowly
wonderingly
say
that
you
did
know
i
loved
him
that
you
still
loved
him
two
years
ago
i
knew
it
was
so
then
but
i
fancied
thought
i
had
forgotten
all
about
him
how
could
you
think
that
is
it
possible
to
love
any
one
and
forget
so
soon
and
live
as
if
nothing
had
happened
that
can
not
be
true
ormonde
i
know
you
me
to
forget
him
and
that
is
what
you
told
him
when
you
saw
him
on
saturday
you
said
i
thought
no
more
of
him
and
that
it
was
better
he
should
see
me
oh
what
right
had
you
to
say
that
where
is
he
now
you
say
you
arc
not
cruel
let
me
know
where
i
can
find
him
there
was
but
one
answer
to
make
yet
ormonde
dreaded
to
utter
it
the
girl
state
was
such
that
it
might
be
fatal
to
tell
her
the
truth
passion
such
as
this
nursed
to
this
through
two
years
in
a
heart
which
could
affect
calm
must
be
very
near
madness
yet
what
help
but
to
tell
the
truth
unless
she
feigned
that
egremont
failure
to
come
on
saturday
was
her
fault
in
the
sense
thyrza
believed
and
then
send
for
him
that
this
terrible
mischief
might
be
undone
if
only
she
could
have
time
to
reflect
whatever
she
did
now
in
this
agitation
she
might
bitterly
repent
only
under
stress
of
the
direst
necessity
could
she
summon
egremont
back
there
was
something
repugnant
to
her
instinct
something
impossible
in
the
thought
of
undoing
all
she
had
done
egremont
position
would
be
ignoble
impossible
to
retrace
her
steps
have
no
wish
to
prevent
you
from
seeing
him
thyrza
she
said
making
her
resolve
even
as
she
spoke
is
not
in
london
now
but
he
will
be
back
before
long
i
think
he
in
england
in
the
north
he
has
gone
to
see
friends
you
do
know
that
he
has
been
in
america
during
these
two
years
something
was
gained
if
thyrza
could
be
brought
to
listen
with
interest
to
details
america
but
he
came
back
at
the
time
how
could
you
refuse
to
keep
your
promise
what
did
he
say
to
you
how
could
he
go
away
again
and
let
you
break
your
word
to
him
in
that
way
ormonde
said
as
gently
as
she
could
did
break
my
word
thyrza
i
gave
him
your
address
he
had
it
on
friday
night
she
whose
nature
it
was
to
trust
implicitly
now
dreaded
a
deceit
in
every
word
she
gazed
at
ormonde
without
change
of
countenance
she
said
slowly
persuaded
him
not
to
come
ormonde
paused
before
replying
is
all
your
faith
in
me
at
an
end
can
not
i
speak
to
you
like
i
used
to
and
be
sure
that
you
trust
my
kindness
to
you
that
you
trust
my
love
love
thyrza
repeated
more
coldly
than
she
had
spoken
yet
you
persuaded
him
not
to
come
to
me
is
true
i
did
ormonde
had
never
spoken
to
any
one
with
a
feeling
of
humiliation
like
this
which
made
her
bend
her
head
thyrza
still
looked
at
her
but
no
longer
with
hostility
she
gazed
with
wonder
with
doubt
did
you
do
that
to
me
mrs
ormonde
there
was
pathos
in
the
simple
words
tears
rushed
to
the
listener
eyes
child
if
i
had
known
the
truth
i
should
have
said
not
a
word
to
prevent
his
going
i
did
not
know
that
you
still
loved
him
hard
as
it
is
for
you
to
believe
that
i
was
deceived
by
your
face
i
have
watched
you
month
after
month
and
as
i
knew
nothing
of
your
reason
for
hope
i
thought
you
had
found
comfort
in
other
things
can
not
you
believe
me
thyrza
you
told
him
that
i
told
him
what
i
thought
was
the
truth
thyrza
i
been
cruel
to
you
but
i
had
no
thought
that
i
was
so
thyrza
asked
after
a
silence
you
told
him
where
i
was
living
told
him
he
asked
me
and
i
told
him
as
i
had
promised
i
would
thyrza
stood
in
deep
thought
ormonde
again
took
her
hands
come
and
sit
down
you
are
worn
out
with
your
trouble
repel
me
thyrza
i
have
done
you
a
great
wrong
and
i
know
you
can
not
feel
to
me
as
you
did
but
i
am
not
so
that
your
suffering
does
not
pierce
me
through
only
sit
here
and
rest
she
allowed
herself
to
be
led
to
the
seat
her
eyes
rested
on
the
ground
for
a
while
then
strayed
to
the
leaves
about
her
which
were
golden
with
the
sunlight
they
intercepted
then
turned
again
to
ormonde
face
knew
where
i
lived
how
could
you
be
sure
he
would
come
to
me
ormonde
sunk
her
eyes
and
made
no
reply
he
promise
you
that
he
would
never
come
made
me
no
promise
thyrza
promise
then
how
do
you
know
that
he
wo
come
a
gleam
shot
to
her
eyes
but
upon
the
moments
of
hope
followed
a
revival
of
suspicion
say
you
ca
prevent
me
from
seeing
him
tell
me
where
he
is
the
place
you
wo
tell
me
if
i
did
how
would
it
help
you
can
not
i
go
there
or
ca
i
write
and
say
that
i
wish
to
speak
to
him
i
asked
no
promise
from
him
that
he
would
go
to
you
i
do
think
you
would
really
try
to
see
him
knowing
that
he
has
your
address
asked
no
promise
ormonde
but
you
persuaded
him
you
spoke
as
you
did
two
years
ago
you
told
him
i
could
never
make
a
fit
wife
for
him
that
he
could
be
happy
with
me
nor
i
with
him
i
did
not
speak
as
i
did
two
years
ago
i
know
you
much
better
than
i
did
then
and
i
told
him
all
that
i
have
since
learnt
no
one
could
speak
in
higher
words
of
a
woman
than
i
did
of
you
and
i
spoke
from
my
heart
for
i
love
you
thyrza
and
your
praise
is
dear
to
me
that
fixed
gaze
of
the
blue
eyes
was
hard
to
bear
so
unutterably
piteous
was
it
so
wofully
it
revealed
the
mind
anguish
ormonde
waited
for
some
reply
but
none
came
do
not
doubt
this
thyrza
still
no
answer
i
give
you
the
address
do
you
feel
able
to
write
before
he
has
there
was
a
change
in
the
listener
face
ormonde
sprang
to
her
and
saved
her
from
falling
nature
had
been
tried
at
last
beyond
its
powers
ormonde
could
not
leave
the
unconscious
form
her
voice
would
not
be
beard
if
she
called
for
help
but
the
fainting
fit
lasted
a
long
time
thyrza
lay
as
one
who
is
dead
her
features
calm
all
the
disfiguring
anguish
passed
from
her
beauty
her
companion
had
a
moment
of
terror
she
was
on
the
point
of
hastening
to
the
house
when
a
sign
of
revival
cheeked
her
she
supported
thyrza
in
her
arms
you
ormonde
was
the
latter
first
whisper
the
tone
as
gentle
and
grateful
as
it
was
always
wont
to
be
you
sit
alone
for
a
minute
dear
while
i
fetch
something
am
well
quite
well
again
thank
you
ormonde
went
and
speedily
returned
thyrza
was
sitting
with
her
eyes
closed
they
spoke
only
broken
words
but
at
length
ormonde
said
must
come
into
the
house
now
thyrza
you
shall
be
quite
alone
you
must
lie
down
i
ca
stay
here
ormonde
i
must
go
back
before
it
gets
too
late
i
must
go
to
the
station
even
had
thyrza
condition
allowed
of
this
her
friend
would
have
dreaded
to
lose
sight
of
her
now
to
let
her
travel
to
london
and
thereafter
be
alone
after
trying
every
appeal
she
refused
to
allow
her
to
go
must
stay
here
for
the
night
thyrza
you
must
i
have
much
more
to
say
to
you
but
first
you
must
rest
come
with
me
her
will
was
the
stronger
thyrza
at
length
suffered
herself
to
be
taken
into
the
house
and
to
a
room
where
she
could
have
perfect
quietness
ormonde
alone
waited
upon
her
brought
her
food
did
everything
to
soothe
body
and
mind
by
sunset
the
weary
one
was
lying
with
her
head
on
the
pillow
on
a
table
within
her
reach
was
a
bell
whose
sound
would
at
once
summon
her
attendant
from
the
next
room
at
ten
ormonde
entered
silently
three
nights
of
watching
and
the
effects
of
all
she
had
endured
this
afternoon
were
weighing
heavily
on
thyrza
eyelids
though
as
yet
she
could
not
sleep
foreseeing
this
ormonde
had
brought
a
draught
which
would
be
the
good
ally
of
nature
striving
for
repose
thyrza
asked
no
question
but
drank
what
was
offered
like
a
child
you
will
soon
rest
dear
i
must
not
ask
you
to
kiss
me
thyrza
the
lips
were
offered
they
were
cold
for
passion
lay
dead
upon
them
she
did
not
speak
but
sank
back
with
a
sigh
and
closed
her
eyes
again
at
midnight
ormonde
entered
the
small
taper
which
burnt
in
the
room
showed
faintly
the
sleeping
face
standing
by
the
bed
she
felt
her
heart
so
wrung
with
sorrow
that
she
wept
in
the
morning
thyrza
declared
that
she
did
not
suffer
she
rose
and
sat
by
the
open
window
she
fancied
she
could
hear
the
sea
said
you
had
more
to
tell
me
ormonde
she
began
when
the
latter
sat
silently
by
her
speak
with
you
and
to
try
to
help
you
my
child
that
was
all
you
told
me
very
little
yesterday
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understood
you
need
not
be
afraid
to
tell
me
anything
i
can
bear
anything
you
ask
me
what
you
wish
to
know
thyrza
say
you
persuaded
him
and
yet
that
you
said
good
of
me
the
other
waited
he
come
from
america
to
see
me
did
mean
that
he
came
because
he
thought
it
was
right
to
i
understand
and
when
you
told
him
that
i
was
not
thinking
of
him
he
he
felt
himself
free
you
think
is
it
likely
that
he
will
ever
wish
to
see
me
now
he
knew
that
you
had
suffered
because
he
did
not
come
he
would
be
with
you
in
a
few
hours
thyrza
gazed
thoughtfully
he
would
ask
me
to
marry
him
he
would
when
you
persuaded
him
not
to
see
me
he
was
glad
to
know
that
he
not
come
it
was
a
former
question
repeated
in
another
way
ormonde
kept
silence
it
was
several
minutes
before
thyrza
spoke
again
do
know
whether
you
will
tell
me
but
did
he
think
of
any
one
else
as
well
as
of
me
when
he
came
back
to
england
am
not
sure
thyrza
you
tell
me
what
friends
he
has
gone
to
see
name
is
newthorpe
newthorpe
the
same
i
once
saw
here
is
miss
newthorpe
name
mrs
ormonde
thyrza
moved
her
lips
as
if
they
felt
parched
she
asked
nothing
further
seemed
indeed
to
forget
that
she
had
been
conversing
she
watched
the
waving
branches
of
a
tree
in
the
garden
ormonde
had
followed
the
working
of
the
girl
mind
with
intense
observation
she
knew
not
whether
to
fear
or
to
be
glad
of
the
strange
tranquillity
that
had
succeeded
upon
such
uncontrolled
vehemence
what
she
seemed
to
gather
from
thyrza
words
she
scarcely
ventured
to
believe
it
was
a
satisfaction
to
her
that
she
had
avoided
naming
egremont
address
yet
a
satisfaction
that
caused
her
some
shame
indeed
it
was
the
sense
of
shame
that
perhaps
distressed
her
most
in
thyrza
presence
egremont
perishable
love
her
own
prudential
forecasts
and
schemings
were
stamped
poor
worldly
ignoble
in
comparison
with
this
sacred
and
extinguishable
ardour
as
a
woman
she
felt
herself
rebuked
by
the
ideal
of
womanly
fidelity
she
was
made
to
feel
the
inferiority
of
her
nature
to
that
which
fate
had
chosen
for
this
supreme
martyrdom
in
her
glances
at
thyrza
face
she
felt
with
new
force
how
spiritual
was
its
beauty
for
in
soulless
features
however
regular
and
attractive
suffering
reveals
the
flesh
this
girl
stricken
with
deadly
pallor
led
the
thoughts
to
the
purest
ideals
of
womanhood
transfigured
by
woe
in
the
pictures
of
old
time
will
go
by
the
train
at
twelve
thyrza
said
moving
at
length
want
you
to
stay
with
me
till
just
till
tomorrow
morning
thyrza
if
my
presence
pains
you
i
will
keep
away
but
stay
till
you
wish
it
mrs
ormonde
you
go
out
into
the
garden
to
the
shore
had
rather
stay
here
she
kept
her
place
by
the
window
through
the
whole
day
as
she
had
sat
in
her
own
room
in
london
she
could
not
have
borne
to
see
the
waves
white
on
the
beach
and
the
blue
horizon
the
sea
that
she
had
loved
so
that
she
had
called
her
friend
would
break
her
heart
with
its
song
of
memories
she
must
not
think
of
anything
now
only
if
it
might
be
put
her
soul
to
sleep
and
let
the
sobbing
waters
of
oblivion
bear
it
onwards
through
the
desolate
hours
she
had
no
pain
her
faculties
were
numbed
her
will
had
spent
itself
ormonde
brought
her
meals
speaking
only
a
word
of
gentleness
in
the
evening
thyrza
said
to
her
you
stay
a
few
minutes
she
sat
down
and
took
thyrza
hand
the
latter
continued
shall
be
glad
if
they
would
give
me
the
sewing
to
do
again
and
the
work
at
the
home
do
you
think
they
will
mrs
ormonde
you
wish
to
go
on
with
your
lessons
i
ca
stay
there
if
i
do
earn
enough
to
pay
for
everything
i
shall
try
to
keep
on
with
the
singing
it
was
perhaps
wiser
to
yield
every
point
for
the
present
shall
be
as
you
wish
thyrza
ormonde
replied
after
a
pause
emerson
will
wonder
where
i
am
will
you
write
to
her
so
that
i
need
explain
when
i
get
back
have
just
had
an
anxious
letter
from
her
and
i
have
already
answered
it
thyrza
withdrew
her
hand
gently
was
wrong
when
i
spoke
in
that
way
to
you
yesterday
ormonde
she
said
meeting
the
other
eyes
have
done
me
harm
intentionally
i
know
that
now
but
if
you
had
let
him
come
to
me
i
do
think
he
would
have
been
sorry
afterwards
when
he
knew
i
loved
him
i
do
think
any
one
will
love
him
more
i
was
very
different
two
years
ago
and
he
thinks
of
me
as
i
was
then
perhaps
if
he
had
seen
me
now
and
spoken
to
me
i
know
i
am
still
without
education
and
i
am
not
a
lady
but
i
could
have
worked
very
hard
so
that
he
should
be
ashamed
of
me
ormonde
turned
her
face
away
and
sobbed
wo
speak
of
it
again
thyrza
said
could
help
it
and
he
did
really
wish
to
come
so
it
was
better
i
am
very
sorry
for
what
i
said
to
you
mrs
ormonde
but
the
other
could
not
bear
it
she
kissed
thyrza
hands
her
tears
falling
upon
them
and
went
away
chapter
xxxix
her
return
it
was
a
rainy
autumn
and
to
thyrza
the
rain
was
welcome
a
dark
weeping
sky
helped
her
to
forget
that
there
was
joy
somewhere
in
the
world
that
there
were
some
whom
golden
evenings
of
the
declining
year
called
forth
to
wander
together
and
to
look
in
each
other
faces
with
the
sadness
born
of
too
much
bliss
when
a
beam
of
sunlight
on
the
wall
of
her
chamber
greeted
her
as
she
awoke
she
turned
her
face
upon
the
pillow
and
wished
that
night
were
eternal
if
she
looked
out
upon
the
flaming
heights
and
hollows
of
a
sunset
between
rain
and
rain
it
seemed
strange
that
such
a
scene
had
ever
been
to
her
the
symbol
of
hope
it
was
cold
now
and
very
distant
what
were
the
splendours
of
heaven
to
a
heart
that
perished
for
lack
of
earth
kindly
dew
to
the
eyes
of
those
who
observed
her
she
was
altered
indeed
but
not
more
so
than
would
be
accounted
for
by
troubles
of
health
consequent
upon
a
sort
of
fever
they
said
which
had
come
upon
her
in
the
hot
summer
days
in
spite
of
her
desire
this
weakness
had
obliged
her
to
give
up
her
for
the
present
lambe
acquaintance
had
said
that
the
exertion
was
too
much
for
her
what
else
that
gentleman
said
in
private
to
ormonde
it
is
not
necessary
to
report
it
was
a
graver
repetition
of
something
that
he
had
hinted
formerly
ormonde
had
been
urgent
in
her
entreaty
that
thyrza
would
come
to
eastbourne
for
a
time
but
could
not
prevail
emerson
refused
to
believe
that
the
illness
was
anything
serious
assure
you
she
said
to
ormonde
is
in
anything
but
low
spirits
as
a
rule
she
does
laugh
quite
so
much
as
she
used
to
but
i
can
always
make
her
as
bright
as
possible
by
chatting
with
her
in
my
foolish
way
for
a
few
minutes
and
when
her
sister
comes
on
sunday
there
not
a
trace
of
gloom
discoverable
i
noticed
it
been
the
same
with
her
the
last
two
autumns
she
be
all
right
by
winter
it
was
true
that
she
disguised
her
mood
with
almost
entire
success
during
lydia
visits
lydia
herself
for
some
cause
was
very
cheerful
throughout
this
season
she
believed
with
more
readiness
than
usual
when
thyrza
spoke
of
her
ailments
as
trifling
every
sunday
she
brought
a
present
of
fruit
thyrza
knew
well
with
how
much
care
the
little
bunch
o
grapes
or
the
sweet
pears
had
been
picked
out
on
saturday
night
at
the
in
lambeth
walk
a
foolish
old
lyddy
to
spend
your
money
on
me
in
this
way
she
said
once
if
i
had
everything
i
want
but
said
lydia
laughing
i
do
give
you
something
now
and
then
you
forget
i
your
elder
sister
and
i
shall
forget
it
too
i
think
i
begun
to
think
of
you
as
if
you
was
older
than
me
thyrza
i
am
dear
as
i
told
you
a
long
time
ago
you
can
talk
properly
which
i
ca
and
you
can
write
well
and
read
hard
books
but
i
used
to
nurse
you
on
my
lap
for
all
that
and
i
remember
you
crying
for
something
i
could
let
you
have
quite
well
thyrza
laughed
in
her
turn
a
laugh
from
a
heart
that
mocked
itself
crying
for
something
she
might
not
have
was
she
then
so
much
older
to
lydia
nothing
was
told
of
the
cessation
of
lessons
and
on
sunday
all
signs
of
needlework
were
hidden
away
emerson
of
course
knew
the
change
that
had
been
made
but
it
was
explained
to
her
as
all
being
on
the
score
of
health
and
thyrza
had
begged
her
to
make
no
allusion
to
the
subject
on
the
occasional
evenings
when
lydia
had
tea
in
room
and
clara
was
of
opinion
that
it
was
very
wise
to
rest
for
a
while
from
books
upon
it
it
your
that
brought
about
all
this
mischief
she
said
and
after
bidding
her
sister
with
a
merry
face
thyrza
would
go
up
to
her
room
and
sink
down
in
weariness
of
body
and
soul
and
weep
her
fill
of
bitter
tears
the
nights
were
so
long
she
never
lay
down
before
twelve
knowing
that
it
was
useless
then
she
would
hear
the
bells
tolling
each
hour
till
nearly
dawn
it
was
like
the
voice
of
a
remorseless
enemy
am
striking
the
hour
of
two
you
think
that
you
will
not
hear
me
when
i
strike
next
you
weep
and
pray
that
sleep
may
close
your
ears
against
me
but
wait
and
see
she
would
sometimes
in
extremity
of
suffering
fling
her
body
down
and
let
her
arms
fall
straight
and
whisper
to
herself
look
now
so
like
death
that
perchance
death
will
come
and
take
me
that
she
might
die
soon
was
her
constant
longing
there
were
times
when
her
youth
asserted
itself
and
bade
her
strive
bade
her
put
away
the
vain
misery
and
look
out
again
into
the
world
of
which
she
had
seen
so
little
a
few
weeks
ago
she
had
rejoiced
in
the
acquiring
of
knowledge
and
longed
to
make
the
chambers
of
her
mind
rich
from
the
fields
to
which
she
had
been
guided
and
which
lay
so
before
her
but
that
was
when
she
had
looked
forward
to
sharing
all
with
her
second
and
dearer
self
now
when
her
thoughts
strayed
it
was
to
gather
the
flowers
of
deadly
fragrance
which
grow
in
the
garden
of
despair
the
brief
glimpses
of
health
made
the
woe
which
followed
only
darker
a
strange
unreal
hope
an
illusion
of
her
tortured
mind
even
now
sometimes
visited
her
it
was
certain
that
egremont
knew
where
she
lived
it
might
be
that
even
yet
he
would
come
perhaps
miss
newthorpe
would
not
receive
him
as
he
hoped
perhaps
ormonde
would
have
pity
and
would
tell
him
the
truth
and
then
he
could
not
let
her
perish
of
vain
longing
what
other
could
love
him
as
she
did
who
else
thought
of
him
are
all
to
me
in
life
or
death
there
is
nothing
for
me
but
you
if
he
knew
that
he
would
come
to
her
she
had
read
a
story
somewhere
of
someone
being
drawn
to
her
who
loved
him
by
the
very
force
of
her
passionate
longing
in
the
dread
nights
she
wondered
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
she
would
lie
still
and
fix
her
mind
on
him
till
all
of
her
seemed
to
have
passed
away
save
that
one
thought
she
was
back
again
in
the
library
helping
to
put
books
on
the
shelves
oh
that
was
no
two
years
ago
it
was
yesterday
this
morning
not
a
tone
of
his
voice
had
escaped
her
memory
she
had
only
to
think
of
the
moment
when
he
held
his
hand
to
her
and
said
us
be
friends
and
her
heart
leaped
now
as
it
had
leaped
then
could
not
her
passion
reach
him
wherever
he
was
could
he
sleep
peacefully
through
nights
which
for
her
were
one
long
anguish
so
it
went
on
to
winter
and
now
she
had
more
rest
her
brain
was
dulled
with
the
foul
black
atmosphere
she
slept
more
though
a
sleep
which
seemed
to
weigh
her
down
an
unhealthful
torpor
the
passion
of
her
misery
had
burned
itself
out
lydia
came
and
spent
christmas
day
with
her
they
talked
of
their
memories
and
thyrza
asked
questions
about
gilbert
grail
as
she
had
several
times
done
of
late
lydia
had
no
very
cheerful
news
to
give
of
him
grail
ca
do
any
work
now
she
sits
by
the
fire
all
day
and
at
night
she
wo
let
him
do
anything
but
talk
to
her
it
is
at
all
a
good
servant
they
got
she
expected
to
come
at
eight
in
the
morning
but
it
almost
always
nine
before
she
gets
there
you
find
someone
better
lyddy
trying
to
but
it
is
easy
i
do
what
i
can
myself
grail
sometimes
seems
as
if
she
does
like
me
to
come
about
she
speak
to
me
this
morning
i
sure
i
do
know
why
she
changed
a
great
deal
from
what
she
was
when
you
knew
her
and
she
ca
bear
to
have
things
moved
in
the
room
for
cleaning
she
gets
angry
with
the
servant
about
it
and
then
the
girl
talks
to
her
as
she
should
and
it
makes
her
cry
she
impatient
with
gilbert
thyrza
asked
i
do
think
so
but
she
always
wants
him
to
be
by
her
if
he
a
few
minutes
late
she
knows
it
and
begins
to
fret
and
worry
he
sits
all
the
evening
just
keeping
her
company
he
reads
to
her
a
good
deal
generally
out
of
those
religious
books
you
remember
i
feel
sorry
for
her
i
so
sure
there
other
things
he
might
read
would
give
her
a
deal
more
comfort
and
think
he
never
got
a
bit
tired
he
that
kind
and
good
to
her
thyrza
i
know
he
must
be
does
ackroyd
ever
come
to
see
him
to
the
house
no
nobody
comes
thyrza
was
very
silent
after
this
two
weeks
later
when
the
new
year
was
lydia
received
this
letter
from
her
sister
want
to
come
and
see
you
in
the
old
room
as
i
said
i
should
and
at
the
same
time
i
want
to
see
gilbert
but
i
must
see
him
alone
i
could
come
at
night
and
you
could
be
at
the
door
to
let
me
in
could
you
dear
you
said
that
grail
goes
to
bed
early
i
could
see
gilbert
after
that
you
may
tell
him
that
i
am
coming
and
ask
him
if
he
will
see
me
i
hope
he
wo
refuse
write
and
let
me
know
when
i
shall
be
at
the
door
night
if
possible
you
will
be
able
to
send
a
letter
that
i
shall
get
by
the
first
post
in
the
morning
had
the
visit
proposed
been
a
secret
one
to
herself
alone
lydia
would
not
have
been
much
surprised
as
thyrza
had
several
times
of
late
said
that
she
wished
to
come
but
the
desire
to
see
gilbert
was
something
of
which
no
hint
had
been
given
till
now
strange
fancies
ran
through
her
head
she
doubted
so
much
on
the
subject
that
she
resolved
to
say
nothing
to
gilbert
if
thyrza
persisted
in
her
wish
it
would
be
possible
to
arrange
the
interview
when
she
was
in
the
house
she
wrote
in
reply
that
she
would
be
standing
at
the
front
door
at
eight
on
the
following
evening
exactly
at
the
moment
appointed
a
figure
hurried
through
the
darkness
out
of
kennington
road
to
the
door
where
lydia
had
been
waiting
for
several
minutes
the
door
was
at
once
opened
thyrza
ran
silently
up
the
stairs
her
sister
followed
and
they
stood
together
in
their
old
home
thyrza
threw
off
her
outer
garments
she
was
panting
from
haste
and
agitation
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
lydia
but
neither
spoke
nor
smiled
you
sure
you
did
right
to
come
dearest
lydia
said
in
a
low
voice
lyddy
quite
sure
was
the
grave
answer
look
worse
you
look
ill
thyrza
no
i
am
quite
well
i
am
glad
to
be
here
thyrza
seated
herself
where
she
had
been
used
to
sit
by
the
fireside
lydia
had
made
the
room
as
bright
as
she
could
but
to
thyrza
how
bare
and
comfortless
it
seemed
here
her
sister
had
lived
whilst
she
herself
had
had
so
many
comforts
about
her
so
many
luxuries
that
poor
narrow
bed
there
she
had
slept
with
lyddy
there
too
she
had
longed
vainly
for
sleep
and
had
shed
her
first
tears
of
secret
sorrow
nothing
whatever
seemed
altered
but
yes
there
was
something
new
above
the
bed
head
hung
on
the
wall
a
picture
of
a
cross
with
flowers
twined
about
it
and
something
written
underneath
noticing
that
thyrza
at
once
took
her
eyes
away
a
bitter
night
lydia
said
approaching
her
and
examining
her
face
anxiously
must
be
very
careful
in
going
back
you
seem
to
have
got
a
chill
now
dear
you
tremble
so
i
stir
the
fire
and
put
more
coals
on
told
gilbert
thyrza
asked
suddenly
did
mention
it
in
your
letter
he
see
me
wo
he
i
have
spoken
to
him
yet
dear
i
thought
it
better
to
leave
it
till
you
were
here
i
sure
he
see
you
if
you
really
wish
do
wish
lyddy
i
sorry
you
left
it
till
now
why
did
you
think
it
better
to
leave
it
do
quite
know
the
other
said
with
embarrassment
seemed
strange
that
you
wanted
to
see
him
i
wish
to
i
go
down
in
a
few
minutes
and
tell
him
they
ceased
speaking
lydia
had
knelt
by
her
sister
her
arm
about
her
thyrza
still
trembled
a
little
but
was
growing
more
composed
presently
she
bent
and
kissed
lydia
hair
did
believe
me
when
i
said
i
should
come
she
whispered
smiling
for
the
first
time
you
sure
you
ought
to
have
come
would
ormonde
mind
am
quite
free
lyddy
i
can
do
as
i
like
i
would
come
in
daylight
only
perhaps
it
would
be
disagreeable
for
you
if
people
saw
me
i
know
they
have
given
me
a
bad
name
one
that
we
need
to
care
about
thyrza
has
no
such
thoughts
now
no
i
see
much
change
in
him
as
much
as
he
will
in
you
dearest
they
were
silent
again
for
a
long
time
then
lydia
went
to
speak
with
gilbert
alone
thyrza
tried
to
recall
the
mind
with
which
she
had
gone
down
to
have
tea
with
the
grails
on
a
sunday
evening
it
used
to
cause
her
excitement
but
that
was
another
than
this
which
now
pained
her
in
those
days
gilbert
grail
was
a
mystery
to
her
inspiring
awe
and
reverence
how
would
he
meet
her
now
would
he
have
bitter
words
for
her
no
that
would
be
unlike
him
she
stand
before
him
and
say
something
which
had
been
growing
in
her
since
the
dark
days
of
winter
began
only
the
utterance
of
those
words
would
bring
her
peace
no
happiness
happiness
and
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
she
thought
she
would
not
live
very
long
she
must
waste
no
more
of
the
days
that
remained
to
her
there
was
need
of
her
here
at
all
events
the
parting
from
her
sister
would
be
at
an
end
lydia
would
rejoice
he
too
yes
would
be
glad
for
he
would
know
nothing
of
the
truth
it
might
be
that
his
whole
future
life
would
be
made
lighter
by
this
act
of
hers
ormonde
alone
would
understand
it
would
give
her
pleasure
to
know
that
gilbert
grail
sorrow
was
at
an
end
so
many
people
to
be
benefited
and
the
act
itself
so
simple
so
merely
a
piece
of
the
reparation
of
so
great
an
injury
strange
that
her
whole
mind
had
undergone
this
renewal
half
a
year
ago
death
would
have
been
chosen
before
this
lydia
returned
grail
will
be
gone
in
half
an
hour
he
will
see
you
then
thyrza
very
few
words
were
interchanged
as
the
time
passed
they
held
each
other
by
the
hand
at
length
lydia
hearing
a
sound
below
went
to
the
door
can
go
now
she
said
returning
i
come
down
with
you
lyddy
can
you
bear
this
thyrza
the
other
smiled
made
a
motion
with
her
hand
and
went
out
with
a
quick
step
the
parlour
door
entrance
so
familiar
to
her
was
half
open
she
entered
and
closed
it
gilbert
came
forward
his
face
was
not
at
all
what
she
had
feared
he
smiled
pleasantly
and
offered
his
hand
you
have
come
to
see
me
as
well
as
lydia
it
is
kind
of
you
the
words
might
have
borne
a
very
different
meaning
from
that
which
his
voice
and
look
gave
them
he
spoke
with
perfect
simplicity
as
though
no
painful
thought
could
be
excited
by
the
meeting
thyrza
saw
in
the
instant
for
which
her
eyes
read
his
countenance
that
he
did
not
often
smile
thus
he
was
noticeably
an
older
man
than
when
she
abandoned
him
his
beard
was
partly
grizzled
his
eyes
were
yet
more
sunken
there
was
some
change
too
in
his
voice
its
sound
did
not
recall
the
past
quite
as
she
had
expected
but
the
change
in
her
was
so
great
that
he
could
not
move
his
eyes
from
her
when
she
looked
up
again
he
still
seemed
to
be
endeavouring
to
recognise
her
did
know
whether
you
would
see
me
she
said
with
hurried
breath
am
very
very
glad
to
see
you
he
seemed
about
to
ask
her
to
sit
down
his
eyes
fell
on
the
chair
which
was
always
called
hers
thyrza
noticed
it
at
the
same
time
from
it
she
looked
to
him
gilbert
averted
his
eyes
did
not
come
to
see
lyddy
thyrza
said
forcing
her
voice
to
steadiness
was
to
speak
to
you
i
did
dare
to
hope
you
would
be
so
say
what
it
pains
you
to
say
gilbert
spoke
when
her
words
failed
will
pain
me
even
more
speak
to
me
like
an
old
friend
miss
trent
you
still
feel
like
a
friend
to
me
do
change
much
he
said
it
would
be
a
great
change
that
would
make
me
have
any
but
friendly
thoughts
of
you
she
raised
her
face
behaved
so
cruelly
to
you
if
i
could
hope
that
you
would
forgive
that
a
sob
broke
her
voice
talk
of
forgiveness
gilbert
replied
with
less
have
never
thought
a
hard
thought
of
you
i
ca
bear
to
hear
speak
in
that
voice
to
me
the
tenderness
he
had
concealed
found
expression
in
the
last
words
her
wonderful
new
beauty
the
humility
of
her
bowed
head
her
tears
overcame
the
show
he
had
made
of
easy
friendliness
he
saw
her
eyes
turned
to
him
again
and
this
time
he
met
their
gaze
you
know
all
of
my
life
since
i
left
you
thyrza
asked
knows
how
i
have
lived
all
the
time
from
that
day
to
this
has
she
told
you
she
has
told
me
you
let
me
fulfil
the
promise
i
made
to
you
can
you
forget
what
i
have
done
will
you
let
me
be
your
companion
do
all
i
can
to
make
your
home
a
happy
one
i
have
no
right
to
ask
but
if
if
not
now
if
some
day
i
could
be
a
help
to
you
i
will
come
to
live
with
lyddy
we
will
find
a
room
somewhere
else
i
will
work
with
lyddy
till
you
can
let
me
come
her
pallor
turned
to
a
deep
flush
she
spoke
brokenly
till
her
lips
became
mute
the
last
word
dying
in
a
whisper
she
had
not
known
what
it
would
cost
her
to
say
this
a
deadly
shame
enfolded
her
she
could
have
sunk
to
the
ground
before
him
after
the
first
sentence
gilbert
listened
and
was
shaken
he
knew
that
this
was
no
confession
of
love
for
him
but
of
the
sincerity
of
what
she
had
said
he
could
have
no
doubt
there
was
not
disgrace
upon
her
she
humbled
herself
solely
in
grief
for
the
suffering
she
had
caused
him
he
loved
her
loved
her
the
more
for
the
awe
her
matured
beauty
inspired
in
him
that
thyrza
should
come
and
speak
thus
was
more
like
a
dream
than
simple
reality
and
for
all
his
longing
he
durst
not
touch
her
hand
you
offer
me
he
said
in
low
tremulous
accents
should
never
have
dared
to
ask
for
it
is
the
greatest
gift
i
can
imagine
you
are
so
far
above
me
now
thyrza
i
should
take
you
into
a
life
that
you
are
no
longer
fit
for
my
home
must
always
be
a
very
poor
one
it
would
shame
me
to
give
you
nothing
better
than
that
want
nothing
more
than
to
be
with
you
gilbert
i
am
not
above
you
you
are
better
in
everything
i
broke
a
promise
which
ought
to
have
been
sacred
if
you
let
me
share
your
life
that
is
your
forgiveness
i
want
you
to
forgive
me
i
want
to
be
a
help
to
you
still
i
wish
to
forget
all
that
came
between
us
you
wo
reject
me
thyrza
i
love
you
too
much
i
am
too
selfish
to
act
as
i
ought
to
thyrza
that
you
can
be
my
wife
still
when
no
spark
of
hope
was
left
to
me
it
did
not
seem
to
lydia
that
she
had
waited
long
when
she
heard
her
sister
step
on
the
stairs
again
must
stay
another
minute
thyrza
said
going
at
once
to
where
her
hat
and
cloak
lay
will
be
late
before
i
get
home
shall
come
with
you
as
far
as
the
lydia
would
have
asked
no
question
though
agitated
with
wonder
and
a
surmise
she
scarcely
dared
to
entertain
when
they
were
both
ready
to
go
out
thyrza
turned
to
her
has
been
very
good
to
me
lyddy
he
will
forget
all
the
harm
i
have
done
him
and
i
shall
be
his
wife
the
other
could
find
no
word
for
a
moment
you
glad
of
this
lyddy
do
know
what
to
think
or
say
her
sister
replied
looking
at
her
with
earnestness
you
always
mean
this
when
you
said
you
were
coming
here
soon
not
always
but
i
was
able
to
do
it
at
last
now
i
shall
rest
dear
sister
are
sure
that
this
is
right
it
is
only
a
fancy
that
you
be
sorry
for
that
make
everything
worse
in
the
end
shall
never
be
sorry
and
everything
will
be
better
lyddy
they
kissed
each
other
dear
i
must
wait
they
walked
quickly
and
without
speaking
as
far
as
the
lights
and
noise
of
westminster
bridge
road
for
them
the
everyday
movement
of
the
street
had
no
meaning
such
things
were
the
mere
husk
of
life
each
was
absorbed
in
her
own
being
shall
come
again
on
saturday
night
thyrza
said
hurriedly
as
they
parted
perhaps
i
shall
stay
over
sunday
may
i
at
the
door
again
at
the
same
time
chapter
xl
her
reward
this
was
on
thursday
the
two
days
which
followed
were
such
as
come
very
rarely
in
a
london
winter
fog
had
vanished
the
ways
were
clean
and
hard
between
the
housetops
and
the
zenith
gleamed
one
clear
blue
track
of
frosty
sky
the
sun
the
very
sun
of
heaven
made
new
the
outline
of
every
street
flashed
on
windows
gave
beauty
to
spires
and
domes
revealed
whiteness
in
untrodden
places
where
the
snow
still
lingered
the
air
was
like
a
spirit
of
joyous
life
tingling
the
blood
to
warmth
and
with
a
breath
freeing
the
brain
from
sluggish
vapours
such
a
day
london
sees
but
once
in
half
a
dozen
winters
thyrza
felt
the
influence
of
the
change
she
breathed
more
easily
her
body
was
no
longer
the
weary
weight
she
had
failed
under
when
she
rose
and
saw
such
marvellous
daylight
at
her
window
involuntarily
she
let
her
voice
run
over
a
few
notes
the
power
of
song
was
still
in
her
ah
if
health
and
happiness
had
companioned
with
her
would
she
not
have
sung
as
few
ever
did
but
henceforth
that
was
part
of
the
past
part
of
what
she
must
forget
and
renounce
when
she
said
to
ormonde
that
she
would
still
try
to
keep
up
her
singing
there
was
a
thought
in
her
mind
worthy
of
a
woman
cast
in
such
a
mould
as
hers
she
had
a
vision
of
herself
on
some
day
not
far
off
sending
forth
her
voice
in
glorious
song
and
knowing
that
among
the
crowd
before
her
sat
and
listened
he
would
know
her
then
to
him
her
voice
would
say
what
no
one
else
understood
and
for
a
moment
she
wished
it
to
be
for
no
more
than
a
moment
he
would
scorn
himself
for
having
forgotten
her
it
was
all
gone
into
the
past
buried
for
ever
out
of
sight
she
would
no
longer
even
sigh
over
the
memory
if
the
sky
were
always
as
if
there
were
always
sunlight
to
stand
in
and
the
living
air
to
drink
she
might
find
the
life
before
her
in
truth
as
little
of
a
burden
as
it
seemed
this
morning
but
the
days
would
again
be
wrapped
in
nether
fumes
the
foul
air
would
stifle
her
her
blood
would
go
stagnant
her
eyes
would
weep
with
the
desolate
rain
why
should
gilbert
remain
in
england
were
there
no
countries
where
the
sun
shone
that
would
give
a
man
and
a
woman
toil
whereby
to
support
themselves
luke
ackroyd
had
spoken
of
going
to
canada
he
said
it
cost
so
little
to
get
there
and
that
life
was
better
than
in
england
could
not
gilbert
take
her
yonder
but
there
was
his
mother
old
weary
no
such
change
was
possible
for
her
and
the
thought
of
her
reminded
thyrza
of
one
of
the
first
duties
she
must
take
upon
herself
it
mattered
little
where
she
lived
mattered
little
if
the
never
broke
again
her
life
was
to
be
in
a
narrow
circle
and
to
that
she
would
accustom
herself
what
of
she
was
full
of
courage
even
of
a
kind
of
hope
never
should
gilbert
feel
that
she
was
not
wholly
his
never
would
she
wrong
his
faithfulness
by
slighting
the
claims
of
his
love
in
her
misery
she
had
said
that
there
were
things
she
could
not
do
could
not
bear
as
if
a
woman
can
not
take
up
any
burden
that
she
wills
and
carry
it
faithfully
even
as
far
as
the
gates
of
death
and
this
duty
before
her
she
would
not
even
think
of
as
a
burden
there
are
some
women
who
never
know
what
love
is
who
marry
a
man
because
they
respect
and
like
him
and
are
good
wives
their
life
long
she
would
be
even
as
one
of
these
suppose
love
to
be
something
she
had
outgrown
the
idleness
of
girls
now
was
the
season
of
her
womanhood
and
the
realities
of
life
left
no
room
for
folly
how
long
since
she
had
felt
so
well
she
sewed
through
the
morning
and
had
but
little
trouble
to
keep
her
thoughts
always
she
sang
a
little
to
herself
for
who
but
must
sing
when
there
is
sunlight
she
ate
when
dinner
was
brought
to
her
then
she
prepared
to
go
out
for
half
an
hour
clara
just
then
came
up
you
are
going
out
do
come
with
us
into
the
park
will
you
you
have
to
go
anywhere
my
husband
has
taken
a
on
purpose
to
skate
reckless
man
he
says
you
do
get
skating
weather
like
this
every
day
can
you
skate
thyrza
shook
her
head
smiling
more
can
harold
wants
to
teach
me
but
it
seems
absurd
to
bruise
oneself
all
over
and
make
oneself
ridiculous
too
to
learn
an
amusement
you
ca
practise
once
in
five
years
but
do
come
with
us
it
really
is
nice
to
watch
them
skating
i
will
come
gladly
thyrza
said
and
so
they
went
to
the
ice
in
regent
park
and
emerson
put
on
his
skates
and
was
speedily
exhibiting
his
skill
amid
the
gliding
crowd
clara
and
her
companion
walked
along
the
edge
thyrza
regarding
this
assembly
of
people
who
had
come
forth
to
enjoy
themselves
marvelled
inwardly
it
was
so
hard
to
understand
how
any
one
could
enter
with
such
seriousness
into
mere
amusement
how
many
happy
people
the
world
contained
of
all
this
swarm
not
one
with
a
trouble
that
could
not
be
flung
away
at
the
summons
of
a
hard
frost
they
sped
about
as
if
on
wings
they
shouted
to
friends
they
had
catastrophes
and
laughed
aloud
over
them
and
as
she
looked
on
the
scene
grew
so
unreal
that
it
frightened
her
these
did
not
seem
to
be
human
beings
how
came
it
that
they
were
exempt
from
the
sorrow
that
goes
about
the
world
blighting
lives
and
breaking
hearts
or
was
it
she
that
lived
in
a
dream
while
these
were
really
awake
she
was
not
sorrowful
now
but
pastime
such
as
this
was
unintelligible
to
her
clara
chatted
and
ran
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
herself
at
one
spot
she
came
at
length
to
a
pause
having
lost
sight
of
her
husband
fretting
that
she
could
not
find
him
her
eye
discovered
him
at
length
however
and
just
as
she
spoke
her
satisfaction
she
was
surprised
by
a
laugh
from
thyrza
a
real
laugh
sweet
and
clear
as
it
used
to
be
is
it
she
asked
in
wonder
look
do
look
just
before
them
on
the
ice
a
little
troop
of
ducks
was
going
by
fowl
dispossessed
of
their
wonted
by
the
frost
of
every
two
steps
the
waddlers
took
one
was
a
hopeless
slip
and
the
spectacle
presented
by
the
unhappy
birds
in
their
effort
to
get
along
at
a
good
round
pace
was
ludicrous
beyond
resistance
they
sprawled
and
fell
they
staggered
up
again
with
indignant
wagging
of
head
and
tail
they
rushed
forward
only
to
slip
more
desperately
now
one
leg
failed
them
now
the
other
now
both
at
once
and
all
the
time
they
kept
up
a
cackle
of
annoyance
they
looked
about
them
with
foolish
eyes
of
amazement
and
indignation
they
wondered
doubtless
what
the
world
was
coming
to
when
an
honest
duck
piece
of
water
was
suddenly
stolen
from
him
and
he
was
subjected
to
insult
on
the
top
of
injury
thyrza
gazed
at
them
and
the
longer
she
gazed
the
more
merrily
she
laughed
ducks
i
never
saw
anything
so
ridiculous
there
look
the
one
with
the
neck
all
bright
colours
he
be
down
again
there
i
said
he
would
why
they
try
to
go
so
quickly
they
would
stumble
half
so
much
if
they
walked
gently
thyrza
had
thought
that
nothing
in
the
world
could
move
her
to
unfeigned
laughter
yet
as
often
as
she
thought
of
the
ducks
it
was
with
revival
of
mirth
she
laughed
at
them
long
after
alone
in
her
room
it
was
as
bright
a
day
on
the
morrow
and
still
she
knew
that
lightness
of
heart
that
freedom
of
the
breath
which
is
physical
happiness
had
she
by
the
mere
act
of
redeeming
her
faith
to
gilbert
brought
upon
herself
this
reward
it
was
so
strangely
easy
to
keep
dark
thoughts
at
a
distance
she
had
not
lain
awake
in
the
night
for
her
a
wonderful
experience
could
it
last
there
was
a
letter
this
morning
from
gilbert
she
did
not
open
it
at
once
for
she
knew
that
there
would
be
more
pain
than
content
in
reading
it
yet
when
she
had
read
it
she
found
that
it
was
not
out
of
harmony
with
her
mood
he
wrote
because
he
could
say
things
in
this
silent
way
which
would
not
come
to
his
lips
so
well
the
gratitude
he
expressed
simply
powerfully
moved
thyrza
not
as
the
words
of
one
she
loved
would
have
moved
her
but
to
a
feeling
of
calm
thankfulness
that
she
had
it
in
her
power
to
give
so
much
joy
and
perhaps
some
day
she
could
give
him
affection
she
had
in
her
belief
spoken
truly
when
she
said
that
he
was
above
her
he
was
no
ignorant
man
without
a
thought
save
of
his
day
earnings
she
could
respect
his
mind
as
she
had
always
done
and
his
character
she
could
reverence
it
was
well
she
told
emerson
that
she
was
going
to
see
her
sister
again
and
that
probably
she
would
not
return
till
sunday
night
on
setting
forth
she
had
a
letter
to
post
it
was
to
ormonde
purposely
she
had
delayed
writing
this
till
saturday
afternoon
she
wished
to
show
that
there
had
been
a
couple
of
days
for
thought
since
the
step
was
taken
and
that
she
could
speak
with
calm
consciousness
of
what
she
had
done
the
posting
of
this
letter
was
like
saying
a
last
lydia
was
again
waiting
just
at
the
door
and
again
they
reached
the
room
without
having
been
observed
shall
go
down
at
once
thyrza
said
expects
me
i
am
going
to
speak
to
mrs
grail
lydia
was
pleased
to
see
that
the
pale
face
had
not
that
terrible
look
there
were
smiles
for
her
and
many
affectionate
words
during
thyrza
absence
of
half
an
hour
she
sat
puzzling
over
the
mystery
as
she
had
puzzled
since
thursday
night
would
all
indeed
be
well
it
was
so
sudden
so
unthought
of
so
hard
to
believe
for
lydia
had
by
degrees
come
to
think
of
her
sister
as
raised
quite
above
this
humble
station
though
she
could
not
reconcile
herself
to
it
though
she
would
above
all
things
have
chosen
that
thyrza
should
still
marry
gilbert
yet
there
was
a
contradictory
sort
of
pride
in
knowing
that
her
sister
was
a
lady
lyddy
we
are
aware
was
little
given
to
logical
processes
of
thought
her
feelings
often
got
her
into
troublesome
perplexities
thyrza
came
up
again
grail
had
received
her
with
tears
and
silence
at
first
but
soon
with
something
of
the
gratitude
which
gilbert
felt
told
them
i
was
going
to
stay
till
i
shall
have
tea
with
them
then
you
spare
me
for
an
hour
lyddy
there
was
no
talk
between
them
as
yet
on
the
main
subject
of
their
thoughts
something
that
was
said
caused
lydia
to
go
to
her
cupboard
and
bring
forth
an
object
which
thyrza
at
once
recognised
it
was
boddy
violin
shall
always
keep
it
she
said
have
had
offers
to
buy
it
but
i
shall
have
to
be
badly
in
want
before
it
goes
she
had
redeemed
it
from
the
pawnbroker
and
no
one
had
opposed
her
claim
to
possess
it
the
expenses
of
the
old
man
burial
had
been
defrayed
by
a
subscription
ackroyd
got
up
among
those
who
remembered
boddy
with
kindness
thyrza
touched
the
strings
and
shrank
back
frightened
at
the
sound
the
ghost
of
dead
music
it
evoked
the
ghost
of
her
dead
self
they
fell
into
solemn
talk
thyrza
had
resolved
that
she
would
not
tell
her
sister
the
truth
of
everything
for
a
long
time
some
day
she
would
do
so
when
the
new
life
had
become
old
habit
but
as
they
sat
by
the
fire
and
spoke
in
low
voices
she
was
impelled
to
make
all
known
why
should
there
any
longer
be
a
secret
between
lyddy
and
herself
it
would
be
yet
another
help
to
her
if
she
told
lyddy
she
felt
at
length
that
she
must
so
the
story
was
whispered
lydia
could
only
hold
her
sister
in
her
arms
and
shed
tears
of
love
and
pity
will
never
speak
of
it
again
dearest
thyrza
said
as
long
as
we
live
never
as
long
as
we
live
all
very
long
ago
already
thyrza
added
do
suffer
now
dear
one
i
have
borne
so
much
that
i
think
i
ca
feel
pain
any
more
with
you
here
in
our
home
i
am
happy
and
wherever
i
am
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
be
i
have
written
to
ormonde
and
she
will
let
him
know
he
will
think
i
came
back
because
i
had
long
forgotten
him
and
was
sorry
that
i
ever
left
gilbert
you
see
what
i
wish
him
to
believe
now
there
be
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
marrying
who
he
likes
no
one
can
say
that
he
has
done
harm
which
can
never
be
undone
can
they
i
shall
rest
now
and
life
will
seem
easy
so
little
will
be
asked
of
me
i
shall
do
my
best
so
willingly
in
the
morning
thyrza
said
have
a
fancy
lyddy
i
want
you
to
do
my
hair
for
me
again
you
wear
it
now
i
mean
in
the
old
way
will
it
make
me
look
a
child
again
never
mind
that
is
what
i
should
like
i
have
it
so
when
i
go
downstairs
to
tea
and
whilst
lydia
was
busy
with
the
golden
tresses
thyrza
laughed
suddenly
she
had
only
just
thought
again
of
the
ducks
in
the
park
she
told
all
about
them
and
they
laughed
together
wonder
whether
jarmey
knows
i
here
thyrza
said
think
not
wo
someone
be
coming
to
see
you
wo
mary
she
always
calls
for
me
to
go
to
chapel
would
you
rather
not
see
her
lyddy
not
till
i
in
my
own
home
i
may
tell
her
you
here
i
go
down
in
time
to
meet
her
and
i
wo
go
to
chapel
this
morning
no
i
stay
with
you
this
morning
dear
so
it
was
arranged
and
they
cooked
their
dinner
as
they
used
to
only
thyrza
declared
that
lydia
had
been
extravagant
in
providing
see
how
you
indulge
yourself
now
that
i
away
oh
yes
of
course
you
pretend
it
only
for
me
how
could
she
be
so
merry
lydia
thought
but
this
smile
was
not
always
on
her
face
the
day
passed
very
quickly
lydia
said
she
would
go
out
whilst
thyrza
was
with
the
grails
she
had
promised
to
see
someone
thyrza
did
not
ask
who
it
was
when
she
came
upstairs
again
the
other
had
not
yet
returned
she
was
yet
a
quarter
of
an
hour
away
then
she
appeared
with
signs
of
haste
was
afraid
you
be
here
alone
she
said
have
you
had
tea
lyddy
this
was
said
rather
mysteriously
and
lydia
subsequent
behaviour
was
also
mysterious
she
took
her
hat
off
and
stood
with
it
in
her
hand
as
if
not
knowing
where
to
put
it
then
she
sat
down
forgetting
that
she
still
wore
her
jacket
reminded
of
this
she
stood
about
the
room
undecidedly
are
you
thinking
of
lyddy
she
sat
down
at
last
but
had
so
singular
a
countenance
that
thyrza
was
obliged
to
remark
on
it
have
you
been
doing
never
mind
if
you
rather
not
tell
me
two
or
three
minutes
passed
before
lydia
could
make
up
her
mind
to
tell
she
began
by
saying
know
when
i
went
down
to
see
mary
this
morning
said
she
seen
that
she
seen
poole
and
that
i
was
to
be
sure
to
go
round
to
poole
some
time
in
the
afternoon
as
she
wanted
to
see
me
particular
and
that
where
you
went
lydia
seemed
to
have
no
more
to
say
thyrza
looked
at
her
searchingly
lyddy
there
nothing
in
that
what
else
i
know
something
else
there
is
i
went
to
the
house
and
when
i
knocked
at
the
door
ackroyd
opened
it
thyrza
had
begun
to
tremble
her
eyes
watched
her
sister
face
eagerly
she
read
something
in
the
heightened
colour
it
showed
then
lyddy
and
then
asked
me
to
come
into
the
and
then
he
he
said
he
wanted
me
to
marry
him
thyrza
it
is
true
at
last
thyrza
could
scarcely
contain
herself
for
joy
she
had
longed
for
this
no
happiness
of
her
own
would
have
been
in
truth
complete
until
there
came
like
happiness
to
her
sister
she
knew
how
long
how
patiently
with
what
lydia
had
been
faithful
to
this
her
first
love
again
and
again
the
love
had
seemed
for
ever
hopeless
yet
lydia
gave
no
sign
of
sorrow
the
sisters
were
unlike
each
other
in
this
lydia
nature
fortunately
for
herself
was
not
passionate
but
its
tenderness
none
knew
as
thyrza
did
its
tenderness
and
its
steadfast
faith
any
one
would
think
you
are
more
glad
of
it
than
i
am
are
no
words
to
tell
my
gladness
dearest
good
lyddy
at
last
at
last
her
face
changed
from
moment
to
moment
it
was
now
flushed
now
again
pale
once
or
twice
she
put
her
hand
against
her
side
excitable
you
always
were
little
one
lydia
said
and
sit
quietly
it
bad
luck
when
any
one
makes
so
much
of
a
thing
thyrza
grew
calmer
her
face
showed
that
she
was
suppressing
pain
in
a
few
minutes
she
said
just
lie
down
lyddy
i
shall
be
better
directly
do
trouble
it
nothing
come
and
sit
by
me
how
glad
i
am
look
pleased
just
to
please
me
will
you
both
were
quiet
thyrza
said
it
had
only
been
a
feeling
of
faintness
it
was
gone
now
the
fire
was
getting
low
lydia
went
to
stir
it
she
had
done
so
and
was
turning
to
the
bed
again
when
thyrza
half
rose
crying
in
a
smothered
voice
come
then
she
fell
back
her
sister
was
bending
over
her
in
an
instant
was
loosening
her
dress
doing
all
that
may
restore
one
who
has
fainted
but
for
thyrza
there
was
no
awaking
had
she
not
herself
desired
it
and
what
gift
more
blessed
of
all
that
man
may
pray
for
she
was
at
rest
the
pure
the
gentle
at
rest
in
her
maidenhood
the
joy
that
had
strength
to
kill
her
was
not
of
her
own
of
the
two
great
loves
between
which
her
soul
was
divided
that
which
was
lifelong
triumphed
in
her
life
last
moment
she
who
wept
there
through
the
night
would
have
lain
dead
if
that
cold
face
could
in
exchange
have
been
touched
by
the
dawn
to
waking
she
felt
that
her
life
was
desolate
she
mourned
as
for
one
on
whom
the
extremity
of
fate
has
fallen
mourn
she
must
in
the
anguish
of
her
loss
she
could
not
know
the
cruelty
that
was
in
her
longing
to
bring
the
sleeper
back
to
consciousness
the
heart
that
had
ached
so
wearily
would
ache
no
more
for
the
tired
brain
there
was
no
more
doubt
had
existence
been
to
her
but
one
song
of
thanksgiving
even
then
to
lie
thus
had
been
more
desirable
for
to
sleep
is
better
than
to
wake
and
how
should
we
who
live
bear
the
day
burden
but
for
the
promise
of
death
on
monday
at
noon
there
arrived
a
telegram
addressed
to
thyrza
trent
gilbert
received
it
from
jarmey
and
he
took
it
upstairs
to
lydia
who
opened
it
it
was
from
ormonde
she
was
at
the
emersons
and
wished
to
know
when
thyrza
would
return
she
desired
to
see
her
you
write
to
her
gilbert
lydia
asked
it
be
better
if
i
went
to
see
her
yes
that
was
felt
to
be
better
it
was
known
that
thyrza
had
written
to
ormonde
on
saturday
so
that
nothing
needed
to
be
explained
gilbert
had
only
to
bear
his
simple
news
arrived
at
the
house
he
had
to
wait
ormonde
was
gone
out
for
an
hour
and
neither
emerson
nor
his
wife
was
at
home
he
sat
in
the
emersons
parlour
seldom
stirring
his
eyes
unobservant
for
gilbert
grail
there
was
little
left
in
the
world
that
he
cared
to
look
at
ormonde
came
in
she
regarded
gilbert
with
uncertainty
having
been
told
that
someone
waited
for
her
but
nothing
more
gilbert
rose
and
made
himself
known
to
her
then
marking
his
expression
she
was
fearful
have
come
from
miss
trent
from
thyrza
she
said
giving
him
her
hand
could
not
come
herself
mrs
ormonde
is
ill
he
hesitated
his
face
had
told
her
the
truth
before
he
uttered
is
dead
it
is
seldom
that
we
experience
a
simple
emotion
when
the
words
incredible
at
first
had
established
their
meaning
in
her
mind
ormonde
knew
that
with
her
human
grief
there
blended
an
thankfulness
she
stood
on
other
ground
than
lydia
on
other
than
gilbert
her
heart
had
been
wrung
by
the
short
unaffected
letter
she
had
received
from
thyrza
and
though
she
could
only
acquiesce
the
future
had
looked
grey
and
joyless
to
hear
it
said
of
thyrza
is
dead
chilled
her
the
world
of
her
affections
was
beyond
measure
poorer
by
the
loss
of
that
sweet
and
noble
being
but
could
she
by
a
word
have
reversed
the
decision
of
fate
love
would
not
have
suffered
her
to
speak
it
they
talked
together
and
at
the
end
she
said
lydia
will
let
me
come
and
see
her
i
shall
be
very
grateful
will
you
ask
her
and
send
word
to
me
speedily
the
permission
was
granted
ormonde
went
to
walnut
tree
walk
that
evening
and
gilbert
conducted
her
to
the
door
of
the
room
the
lamp
gave
its
ordinary
stinted
light
there
was
nothing
unusual
in
the
appearance
of
the
chamber
in
the
bed
one
lay
asleep
ormonde
took
lydia
hands
and
without
speaking
kissed
her
then
lydia
raised
the
lamp
from
the
table
and
held
it
so
that
the
light
fell
on
her
sister
face
no
remnant
of
pain
was
there
only
calm
unblemished
beauty
the
lips
were
as
naturally
composed
as
if
they
might
still
part
to
give
utterance
to
song
the
brow
showed
its
lines
of
high
imaginativeness
even
more
clearly
than
in
life
the
golden
braid
rested
by
her
neck
as
in
childhood
you
any
picture
of
her
ormonde
asked
you
let
me
have
one
made
drawn
from
her
face
now
but
looking
as
she
did
in
life
it
shall
be
done
by
a
good
artist
i
think
it
can
be
done
successfully
lydia
was
in
doubt
the
thought
of
introducing
a
stranger
to
this
room
to
sit
and
pore
upon
the
dead
face
with
cold
interest
was
repugnant
to
her
yet
if
thyrza
face
really
could
be
preserved
to
look
at
her
for
others
dear
to
her
to
look
at
that
would
be
much
she
gave
her
assent
mary
bower
came
frequently
her
silent
presence
was
a
help
to
lydia
through
the
miseries
of
the
next
few
days
one
other
there
was
who
asked
timidly
to
be
allowed
to
see
thyrza
once
more
her
friend
totty
she
sought
mary
bower
and
said
how
much
she
wished
it
though
she
feared
lydia
would
not
grant
her
wish
but
it
was
granted
readily
totty
had
her
sad
pleasure
and
her
solemn
memory
ormonde
knew
that
it
was
better
for
her
not
to
attend
the
funeral
on
the
evening
before
she
left
at
the
house
a
small
wreath
of
white
flowers
lydia
gilbert
mary
bower
luke
ackroyd
and
his
sister
these
only
went
to
the
cemetery
he
whom
thyrza
would
have
wished
to
follow
her
in
thought
at
least
to
the
grave
was
too
far
away
to
know
of
her
death
till
later
the
next
day
lydia
sat
for
an
hour
with
ackroyd
they
did
not
speak
much
but
before
she
left
him
lydia
looked
into
his
face
and
said
you
wish
me
to
believe
luke
that
i
shall
never
see
my
sister
again
he
bent
his
face
and
kept
silence
you
think
that
i
could
live
if
i
believed
that
she
was
gone
for
ever
that
i
should
never
meet
thyrza
after
this
never
again
shall
never
wish
you
to
think
in
that
way
lyddy
he
answered
kindly
often
talked
as
if
i
knew
things
for
certain
when
i
know
nothing
you
better
in
yourself
than
i
am
and
you
may
feel
more
of
the
truth
the
next
morning
lydia
went
to
her
work
as
usual
gilbert
had
already
returned
to
his
the
clear
winter
sunshine
was
already
a
thing
of
the
far
past
in
the
streets
was
the
slush
of
thaw
and
darkness
fell
early
from
the
obscured
sky
chapter
xli
the
living
this
winter
the
newthorpes
spent
abroad
newthorpe
was
in
very
doubtful
health
when
he
went
to
ullswater
just
before
return
to
england
and
by
the
end
of
the
autumn
his
condition
was
such
as
to
cause
a
renewal
of
annabel
former
fears
on
a
quick
decision
they
departed
for
cannes
and
remained
there
till
early
in
the
following
april
a
sort
of
absurdity
newthorpe
remarked
living
when
you
can
think
of
nothing
but
how
you
to
save
your
life
better
have
done
with
it
i
think
it
strikes
me
as
an
impiety
too
to
go
playing
at
with
the
gods
they
came
back
to
eastbourne
which
on
the
whole
seemed
to
suit
the
invalid
during
these
summer
months
he
did
little
now
but
muse
over
a
few
favourite
books
and
listen
to
his
daughter
conversation
comparatively
a
young
man
his
energies
were
spent
his
life
was
behind
him
to
annabel
it
was
infinitely
sorrowful
to
have
observed
this
rapid
process
of
decay
she
could
not
be
persuaded
that
the
failure
of
his
powers
was
anything
more
than
temporary
but
her
father
lost
no
opportunity
of
warning
her
that
she
deceived
herself
he
had
his
reasons
for
doing
so
his
temper
was
perfect
his
outlook
on
the
world
remained
that
of
a
genial
pessimist
a
type
of
man
common
enough
in
our
day
he
seemed
to
find
a
pleasure
in
urbanely
mocking
at
his
own
futility
am
the
sort
of
man
he
once
said
whom
tourgueneff
would
make
an
admirable
study
there
tragedy
in
me
if
you
have
the
eyes
to
see
it
i
do
think
any
one
can
help
feeling
kindly
towards
me
i
think
any
one
can
altogether
despise
me
yet
my
life
is
a
mere
inefficacy
have
had
much
enjoyment
in
your
life
father
annabel
replied
enjoyment
of
the
purest
kind
in
our
age
of
the
world
i
think
that
must
be
a
sufficient
content
there
you
hit
it
bell
is
the
age
there
somebody
else
i
know
who
had
better
take
warning
by
me
but
i
think
he
has
done
they
were
talking
thus
as
they
sat
alone
in
one
of
the
places
of
shelter
on
the
parade
other
people
had
departed
on
the
serious
business
of
dining
but
the
evening
was
beautiful
and
these
two
were
tempted
to
remain
and
watch
the
sea
mean
egremont
annabel
said
i
wonder
very
much
what
he
will
be
at
my
age
he
wo
be
anything
particular
of
course
i
do
suppose
he
will
do
anything
remarkable
the
girl
assented
impartially
he
might
have
done
recommenced
her
father
with
some
annoyance
as
if
his
remark
had
not
elicited
the
answer
he
looked
for
of
his
i
consider
mere
discipline
i
should
have
thought
two
years
of
it
enough
three
certainly
ought
to
be
a
fourth
and
he
will
never
do
anything
else
else
should
he
do
newthorpe
laughed
a
little
only
one
thing
for
such
a
fellow
to
do
nowadays
let
him
write
something
annabel
mused
i
suppose
there
is
nothing
else
yet
he
happens
to
have
sufficient
means
you
mean
it
for
an
epigram
well
it
will
pass
true
there
the
hardship
of
his
position
there
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
to
write
yet
he
is
handicapped
by
his
money
i
should
have
done
something
worth
the
doing
if
i
had
had
to
write
for
bread
and
cheese
let
him
show
that
he
has
something
in
him
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
has
never
gone
without
his
dinner
yes
but
that
would
prove
him
an
extraordinary
man
and
we
agree
that
he
is
nothing
of
the
kind
you
ever
felt
a
sort
of
uneasy
shame
when
you
have
heard
of
another
acquaintance
taking
up
the
pen
course
i
have
i
felt
the
same
when
i
heard
of
someone
being
born
i
announced
to
you
that
i
was
writing
a
novel
am
a
philosopher
bell
it
would
be
disagreeable
to
me
if
i
heard
that
egremont
was
writing
a
novel
if
he
published
anything
very
good
it
trouble
one
so
much
after
the
event
i
do
see
why
he
should
write
i
think
he
better
continue
to
give
half
his
day
to
something
practical
and
the
other
half
to
the
pleasures
of
a
man
of
culture
it
will
preserve
his
balance
mia
you
are
greatly
disillusioned
for
a
young
girl
do
feel
that
the
term
is
applicable
to
me
i
am
disillusioned
father
because
i
am
getting
reasonably
old
live
too
much
alone
prefer
it
newthorpe
seemed
to
be
turning
over
a
thought
suppose
he
said
at
length
with
a
glance
at
his
daughter
what
you
have
just
said
explains
our
friend
return
to
his
entirely
i
think
you
sent
him
about
his
business
however
annabel
looked
straight
before
her
at
the
sea
her
lips
barely
smiled
are
mistaken
he
gave
me
no
right
to
do
so
then
i
have
been
on
a
wrong
tack
we
walk
homewards
towards
the
end
of
august
and
dalmaine
were
at
eastbourne
for
a
few
days
paula
spent
one
hour
with
her
cousin
in
private
no
more
the
two
had
drifted
further
apart
than
ever
but
in
that
one
hour
paula
had
matter
enough
for
talk
there
had
been
a
general
election
during
the
summer
and
dalmaine
had
victoriously
retained
his
seat
for
vauxhall
his
wife
could
speak
of
nothing
else
i
would
have
given
if
you
could
have
seen
me
canvassing
bell
now
i
found
the
one
thing
that
i
can
do
really
well
i
wish
parliaments
were
annual
dear
paula
what
has
made
you
so
misanthropic
do
understand
you
know
i
never
do
understand
your
clever
remarks
bell
please
speak
quite
simply
will
you
oh
but
the
canvassing
of
course
i
did
get
on
with
people
wives
as
well
as
with
people
themselves
women
never
do
you
know
you
should
have
heard
me
arguing
questions
with
working
men
and
shopkeepers
dalmaine
once
told
me
i
better
keep
out
of
politics
as
i
only
made
a
bungle
of
it
but
i
learnt
a
great
deal
since
then
he
admits
now
that
i
really
do
understand
the
main
questions
of
course
it
all
his
teaching
he
puts
things
so
clearly
you
know
i
suppose
there
no
one
in
the
house
who
makes
such
clear
speeches
as
he
does
result
of
your
work
was
very
satisfactory
it
fifteen
hundred
majority
then
we
drove
all
about
the
borough
and
i
had
to
bow
nicely
to
people
who
waved
their
hats
and
shouted
it
was
a
new
sensation
i
think
i
never
enjoyed
anything
so
much
in
my
life
he
is
enormously
popular
my
husband
and
everybody
says
he
is
doing
an
enormous
lot
of
good
you
know
bell
it
was
a
mere
chance
that
he
is
in
the
ministry
his
name
was
mentioned
we
know
it
for
a
fact
there
no
doubt
whatever
he
be
in
next
time
if
the
liberal
government
keeps
up
it
is
so
annoying
that
parliaments
generally
last
so
long
think
what
that
will
be
when
he
is
a
minister
i
should
wonder
if
you
come
to
see
me
some
day
in
downing
street
bell
should
be
afraid
paula
your
husband
will
bring
you
do
you
think
looking
remarkably
well
i
so
sorry
i
have
got
my
little
boy
here
for
you
to
see
we
decided
that
to
be
prime
minister
i
hope
you
read
dalmaine
speeches
bell
good
of
you
he
thinking
of
publishing
a
volume
of
those
that
deal
with
factory
legislation
you
should
have
heard
what
they
said
about
him
at
the
election
time
paula
was
still
charming
but
it
must
be
confessed
a
trifle
vulgarised
formerly
she
had
not
been
vulgar
at
all
at
present
one
discerned
unmistakably
the
influence
of
her
husband
and
of
the
world
in
which
she
lived
in
person
she
showed
the
matron
somewhat
prematurely
one
saw
that
in
another
ten
years
she
would
be
portly
her
round
fair
face
would
become
too
round
and
too
pinky
mentally
she
was
at
length
formed
and
to
dalmaine
was
due
the
credit
of
having
formed
her
this
gentleman
did
his
kinsfolk
the
honour
of
calling
upon
them
he
had
grown
a
little
stouter
he
bore
himself
with
conscious
dignity
you
saw
that
he
had
not
much
time
nor
much
attention
to
bestow
upon
unpolitical
people
he
was
suave
and
abrupt
by
turns
he
used
his
hands
freely
in
conversing
newthorpe
smiled
much
during
the
interview
with
him
and
a
few
hours
later
when
alone
with
annabel
he
suddenly
exclaimed
an
ignorant
pretentious
numskull
that
fellow
is
whom
do
you
speak
of
dalmaine
of
course
dear
father
a
philanthropist
one
of
the
forces
of
the
time
newthorpe
leaned
back
and
laughed
true
he
said
presently
we
may
arrive
at
certain
conclusions
with
regard
to
mankind
at
large
and
our
time
in
particular
that
poor
pretty
girl
it
too
bad
is
happy
again
and
it
would
be
foolish
to
wish
her
miserable
bell
let
us
join
hands
and
go
to
the
old
ferryman
boat
together
would
cost
me
no
pang
father
still
we
will
walk
a
little
longer
on
the
and
whilst
this
conversation
was
going
on
and
dalmaine
sat
after
dinner
on
the
balcony
of
their
hotel
talking
occasionally
dalmaine
smoked
a
cigar
his
eyes
betrayed
the
pleasures
of
digestion
and
thought
on
high
matters
of
state
he
said
all
at
once
lady
wigger
is
at
the
queen
hotel
i
see
you
will
call
wigger
but
really
i
do
think
i
can
dear
paula
replied
timidly
not
you
know
she
was
so
shockingly
rude
to
me
at
the
huntleys
ball
you
said
it
was
abominable
yourself
it
was
but
you
better
call
much
rather
not
dalmaine
looked
at
her
with
olympian
surprise
my
dear
he
said
with
suave
firmness
said
that
you
had
better
call
the
people
must
not
be
neglected
they
will
be
useful
do
you
understand
me
love
paula
was
quiet
for
a
few
moments
then
talked
as
brightly
as
ever
one
day
close
upon
the
end
of
september
ormonde
had
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
little
village
of
west
dean
which
is
some
four
miles
distant
from
eastbourne
inland
and
westward
business
of
a
domestic
nature
took
her
thither
she
wished
to
visit
a
cottage
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
a
girl
whom
she
thought
of
engaging
as
a
servant
the
day
was
very
beautiful
she
asked
the
newthorpes
to
accompany
her
on
the
drive
newthorpe
preferred
to
remain
at
home
annabel
accepted
the
invitation
the
road
was
uphill
until
the
level
of
the
downs
was
reached
then
it
went
winding
along
with
fair
stretches
of
scenery
on
either
hand
between
fields
fragrant
of
autumn
overhead
the
broad
soft
purple
sky
first
east
dean
was
passed
a
few
rustic
houses
nestling
as
the
name
implies
in
its
gentle
hollow
after
that
another
gradual
ascent
and
presently
the
carriage
paused
at
a
point
of
the
road
immediately
above
the
village
to
which
they
were
going
the
desire
to
stop
was
simultaneous
in
ormonde
and
her
companion
their
eyes
rested
on
as
sweet
a
bit
of
landscape
as
can
be
found
in
england
one
of
those
scenes
which
are
typical
of
the
southern
countries
it
was
a
broad
valley
at
the
lowest
point
of
which
lay
west
dean
the
hamlet
consists
of
very
few
houses
all
so
compactly
grouped
about
the
old
church
that
from
this
distance
it
seemed
as
if
the
hand
could
cover
them
the
roofs
were
overgrown
with
lichen
yellow
on
slate
red
on
tiles
in
the
farmyards
were
haystacks
with
yellow
conical
coverings
of
thatch
and
around
all
closed
dense
masses
of
chestnut
foliage
the
green
just
touched
with
gold
the
little
group
of
houses
had
mellowed
with
age
their
guarded
peacefulness
was
soothing
to
the
eye
and
the
spirit
along
the
stretch
of
the
hollow
the
land
was
parcelled
into
meadows
and
tilth
of
varied
hue
here
was
a
great
patch
of
warm
grey
soil
where
horses
were
drawing
the
harrow
yonder
the
same
work
was
being
done
by
sleek
black
oxen
where
there
was
pasture
its
colour
told
of
the
nature
of
the
earth
which
produced
it
a
vast
oblong
running
right
athwart
the
far
side
of
the
valley
had
just
been
strewn
with
loam
it
was
the
darkest
purple
the
bright
yellow
of
the
spread
in
several
directions
and
here
and
there
rose
thin
wreaths
of
white
smoke
where
a
pile
of
uprooted
was
burning
the
scent
was
borne
hither
by
a
breeze
that
could
be
scarcely
felt
the
clock
of
the
old
church
struck
four
kindness
mrs
ormonde
said
annabel
me
stay
here
whilst
you
drive
down
into
the
village
i
do
wish
to
see
the
people
there
just
now
to
sit
here
and
look
down
on
that
picture
will
do
me
good
all
means
but
i
dare
say
i
shall
be
half
an
hour
it
will
take
ten
minutes
to
drive
down
mind
i
shall
sit
here
on
the
bank
and
enjoy
myself
now
it
happened
that
on
this
same
september
day
a
young
man
left
brighton
and
started
to
walk
eastward
along
the
coast
he
had
come
into
brighton
from
london
the
evening
before
having
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
family
of
an
acquaintance
of
his
who
had
recently
died
in
pennsylvania
and
who
when
dying
had
asked
him
to
perform
this
office
on
his
return
to
england
he
was
no
stranger
to
brighton
he
knew
that
if
one
is
obliged
to
visit
the
place
it
is
well
to
be
there
under
cover
of
the
night
and
to
depart
as
speedily
as
possible
from
amid
its
vulgar
hideousness
so
not
later
than
eight
on
the
following
morning
he
had
left
the
abomination
behind
him
and
was
approaching
rottingdean
his
destination
was
eastbourne
the
thought
of
going
thither
on
foot
came
to
him
as
he
glanced
at
a
map
of
the
coast
whilst
at
breakfast
the
weather
was
perfect
and
the
walk
would
be
full
of
interest
one
would
have
said
that
he
had
a
mind
very
free
from
care
for
the
most
part
he
stepped
on
at
a
good
round
pace
observing
well
sometimes
he
paused
as
if
merely
to
enjoy
the
air
he
was
in
excellent
health
he
smiled
readily
at
rottingdean
he
lingered
for
awhile
a
soft
mist
hung
all
around
sky
and
sea
were
of
a
delicate
blurred
the
former
mottled
in
places
the
sun
was
not
visible
but
its
light
lay
in
one
long
gleaming
line
out
on
the
level
water
beyond
all
was
there
were
no
breakers
now
and
then
a
larger
ripple
than
usual
splashed
on
the
beach
and
that
was
the
only
sound
the
sea
gave
it
was
full
tide
the
water
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
was
of
a
wonderful
green
pellucid
delicate
through
which
the
chalk
was
visible
with
dark
masses
of
weed
here
and
there
swallows
in
great
numbers
flew
about
the
edge
and
floated
everywhere
from
the
fields
came
a
tinkle
of
the
pedestrian
sighed
when
he
rose
to
continue
his
progress
it
was
noticeable
that
as
he
went
on
he
lost
something
of
his
cheerfulness
of
manner
probably
the
early
rising
and
the
first
taste
of
exercise
had
had
their
effect
upon
him
and
now
he
was
returning
to
his
more
wonted
self
the
autumn
air
the
mist
the
silent
sea
would
naturally
incline
to
pensiveness
one
who
knew
that
mood
the
air
was
unimaginably
calm
the
gave
proof
that
only
the
faintest
breath
was
stirring
on
the
downs
beyond
rottingdean
lay
two
or
three
prone
as
they
watched
the
semicircle
of
in
cages
and
held
their
hand
on
the
string
which
closed
the
nets
the
young
man
spoke
a
few
words
with
one
of
these
curious
about
his
craft
he
came
down
upon
newhaven
and
halted
in
the
town
for
refreshment
then
having
loitered
a
little
to
look
at
the
shipping
he
climbed
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
and
made
his
way
as
far
as
seaford
thence
another
climb
and
a
bend
inland
for
the
next
indentation
of
the
coast
was
cuckmere
haven
and
the
water
could
only
be
crossed
at
some
distance
from
the
sea
the
country
through
which
the
cuckmere
flowed
had
a
melancholy
picturesqueness
it
was
a
great
reach
of
level
meadows
very
marshy
with
rushes
growing
in
every
ditch
and
low
trees
in
places
their
trunks
wrapped
in
bright
yellow
lichen
nor
only
their
trunks
but
the
very
smallest
of
their
twigs
was
so
clad
all
over
the
flats
were
cows
pasturing
black
cows
contrasting
with
flocks
of
white
sheep
which
were
gathered
together
bleating
the
coarse
grass
was
the
slope
of
the
downs
on
either
side
showed
the
customary
chalky
green
the
mist
had
now
all
but
dispersed
yet
there
was
still
only
blurred
sunshine
rooks
hovered
beneath
the
sky
heavily
lazily
and
uttered
their
long
caws
the
cuckmere
was
crossed
and
another
ascent
began
the
sea
was
now
hidden
the
road
would
run
inland
cutting
off
the
great
angle
made
by
beachy
head
the
pedestrian
had
made
notes
of
his
track
he
knew
that
he
was
now
approaching
a
village
called
west
dean
he
had
lingered
by
the
cuckmere
now
he
braced
himself
and
he
came
in
sight
of
west
dean
as
the
church
clock
struck
four
he
wished
now
to
make
speed
to
eastbourne
but
the
loveliness
of
the
hollow
above
which
the
road
ran
perforce
checked
him
he
paced
forward
very
slowly
his
eyes
bent
upon
the
hamlet
something
moved
near
to
him
he
looked
round
a
lady
was
standing
in
the
road
and
of
all
strange
things
a
lady
of
whom
at
that
moment
he
was
thinking
what
inconceivable
chance
does
this
happen
miss
newthorpe
he
said
taking
her
offered
hand
the
question
would
come
with
even
more
force
from
me
annabel
made
answer
might
have
presumed
me
to
be
in
england
egremont
i
on
the
other
hand
certainly
imagined
that
you
were
beyond
the
atlantic
have
been
in
england
a
day
or
two
here
looking
down
upon
west
dean
have
walked
from
brighton
one
of
the
most
delightful
walks
i
ever
took
long
one
surely
i
am
waiting
for
ormonde
she
is
with
the
carriage
below
i
chose
to
wait
here
to
feast
my
eyes
both
turned
again
to
the
picture
the
two
did
not
sort
ill
together
annabel
was
very
womanly
of
fair
thoughtful
countenance
and
she
stood
with
no
less
grace
though
maturer
than
by
the
ripples
of
ullswater
four
years
ago
she
had
the
visage
of
a
woman
whose
intellect
is
highly
trained
a
face
sensitive
to
every
note
of
the
soul
music
yet
impressed
with
the
sober
consciousness
which
comes
of
and
experience
a
woman
one
would
have
said
who
could
act
as
nobly
as
she
could
speak
yet
who
would
prefer
both
to
live
and
to
express
herself
in
a
minor
key
and
egremont
was
not
unlike
her
in
some
essential
points
the
turn
for
irony
was
more
pronounced
on
his
features
yet
he
had
the
eyes
of
an
idealist
he
too
would
choose
restraint
in
preference
to
outbreak
of
emotion
he
too
could
be
forcible
if
occasion
of
sufficient
pressure
lay
upon
him
and
the
probability
remained
that
both
one
and
the
other
would
choose
a
path
of
life
where
there
was
small
risk
of
their
stronger
faculties
being
demanded
they
talked
of
the
landscape
of
that
exclusively
until
carriage
was
seen
reascending
the
hill
then
they
became
silent
and
stood
so
as
their
common
friend
drew
near
her
astonishment
was
not
slight
but
she
gave
it
only
momentary
expression
then
passed
on
to
general
talk
always
regard
you
as
reasonably
emancipated
annabel
she
said
none
the
less
i
felt
a
certain
surprise
in
noticing
you
intimately
conversing
with
a
chance
wayfarer
egremont
be
good
enough
to
seat
yourself
opposite
to
us
they
drove
back
to
eastbourne
all
conversed
on
the
way
with
as
much
ease
as
if
they
had
this
afternoon
set
forth
in
company
from
the
chestnuts
is
what
at
school
we
used
to
call
a
said
egremont
welcome
one
too
i
should
think
ormonde
replied
you
always
calculated
distances
by
i
remember
when
others
measure
by
the
carriage
or
the
railway
annabel
you
too
are
an
excellent
walker
you
have
often
brought
me
to
extremities
in
the
lakes
though
i
would
confess
it
and
pray
egremont
for
whom
was
your
visit
intended
shall
i
put
you
down
at
newthorpe
door
or
had
you
my
humble
house
in
view
is
natural
to
me
to
count
upon
the
chestnuts
as
a
place
of
rest
at
all
events
walter
replied
should
not
have
ventured
to
disturb
newthorpe
this
evening
will
wait
at
the
door
ormonde
put
in
annabel
will
come
out
as
he
always
does
accordingly
the
carriage
was
stopped
at
the
newthorpes
house
and
as
annabel
had
predicted
her
father
sauntered
forth
how
do
you
do
egremont
he
said
after
a
scarcely
appreciable
hesitation
giving
his
hand
with
perfect
up
on
the
road
have
you
the
ladies
laughed
annabel
left
the
carriage
and
the
other
two
drove
on
to
the
chestnuts
egremont
dined
and
spent
the
evening
with
ormonde
their
conversation
was
long
and
intimate
yet
it
was
some
time
before
reference
was
made
to
the
subject
both
had
most
distinctly
in
mind
went
to
see
grail
as
soon
as
i
got
to
london
egremont
said
at
length
am
glad
of
that
but
how
did
you
know
where
to
find
him
gave
me
his
address
at
the
old
house
he
seems
comfortably
lodged
with
his
friend
ackroyd
ackroyd
opened
the
door
to
me
of
course
i
did
know
her
and
she
would
know
me
grail
told
me
who
it
was
afterwards
i
could
recall
no
likeness
to
her
sister
is
very
little
the
poor
girl
is
in
calm
water
at
last
i
hope
she
was
to
have
been
married
on
midsummer
day
and
the
night
before
grail
died
so
they
put
it
off
and
what
of
mr
grail
behaved
admirably
to
me
he
did
not
let
me
feel
for
a
moment
that
i
excited
any
trouble
in
his
memory
does
his
life
seem
bitter
to
him
his
employment
i
mean
ca
think
he
finds
it
so
he
spoke
very
frankly
and
assured
me
that
he
has
all
the
leisure
time
he
cared
to
use
he
says
he
is
not
so
eager
after
knowledge
as
formerly
it
is
enough
for
him
to
read
the
books
he
likes
i
went
with
the
intention
of
asking
him
to
let
me
be
of
some
use
if
i
could
but
it
was
a
delicate
matter
in
any
case
and
i
found
that
he
understood
me
without
plain
speech
he
conveyed
his
answer
distinctly
enough
no
i
sincerely
think
that
he
has
reached
that
point
of
resignation
at
which
a
man
dreads
to
be
disturbed
he
spoke
with
emotion
of
ackroyd
she
is
invaluable
to
him
i
saw
is
a
woman
egremont
let
a
minute
pass
then
said
will
show
me
the
portrait
it
hangs
in
my
bedroom
i
will
fetch
it
she
went
and
returned
quickly
carrying
a
red
crayon
drawing
framed
in
plain
oak
in
the
corner
was
a
signature
that
of
one
of
the
few
living
artists
to
whom
one
would
appeal
with
confidence
for
the
execution
of
a
task
such
as
this
a
man
whom
success
has
not
vulgarised
and
who
is
still
of
opinion
that
the
true
artist
will
oftener
find
his
inspiration
in
a
london
garret
than
amid
the
banality
of
the
plutocrat
the
work
was
of
course
masterly
in
execution
it
was
no
less
admirable
as
a
portrait
in
those
few
lines
of
chalk
thyrza
lived
he
had
divined
the
secret
of
the
girl
soul
that
gift
of
passionate
imagination
which
in
her
early
years
sunk
her
in
reverie
and
later
burned
her
life
away
the
mood
embodied
was
one
so
characteristic
of
thyrza
that
one
marvelled
at
the
insight
which
had
evoked
it
from
a
dead
face
she
was
not
happy
she
was
net
downcast
her
eyes
something
something
which
stirred
her
being
something
for
which
she
yearned
passionately
yet
with
knowledge
that
it
was
for
ever
forbidden
to
her
a
face
of
infinite
pathos
which
drew
tears
to
the
eyes
yet
was
unutterably
sweet
to
gaze
upon
holding
the
picture
egremont
turned
to
his
companion
and
said
in
a
subdued
voice
was
thyrza
very
self
knew
her
story
bare
facts
of
course
without
names
without
details
he
would
take
nothing
for
the
original
drawing
lydia
has
it
and
nothing
for
this
copy
which
he
made
me
he
said
i
had
done
him
a
great
kindness
if
one
could
be
a
man
like
that
the
words
answered
to
his
thoughts
yet
implied
something
more
than
their
plain
meaning
they
uttered
more
than
one
regret
more
than
one
aspiration
me
take
it
walter
moment
this
was
thyrza
me
take
it
me
has
miss
newthorpe
seen
it
ormonde
bore
the
picture
away
in
a
few
minutes
egremont
took
his
leave
and
went
to
the
hotel
to
which
he
had
sent
his
from
brighton
it
was
long
before
he
slept
he
was
thinking
of
a
night
a
little
more
than
a
year
ago
when
he
had
walked
by
the
shore
and
held
debate
with
himself
on
the
following
evening
shortly
before
sunset
annabel
and
he
walked
on
the
short
dry
grass
of
the
down
that
rises
to
beachy
head
there
had
been
another
day
of
supreme
tranquillity
of
blurred
sunshine
of
soothing
autumnal
warmth
and
this
was
the
crowning
hour
the
mist
had
drifted
from
the
land
and
the
sea
as
the
two
continued
their
ascent
the
view
became
lovelier
they
regarded
it
but
spoke
of
other
things
have
no
wish
to
go
back
to
america
egremont
was
saying
if
i
do
i
shall
very
likely
settle
there
for
good
i
do
think
i
am
ideally
adapted
to
a
pursuit
of
that
kind
but
habit
makes
it
quite
tolerable
should
you
do
if
you
remained
in
england
annabel
asked
her
voice
implying
no
more
than
friendly
interest
might
say
that
i
do
know
but
it
would
be
true
i
know
well
enough
i
should
live
the
life
of
a
student
and
of
a
man
who
looks
on
contemporary
things
with
an
artistic
interest
though
he
lacks
the
artistic
power
to
use
his
observations
in
time
i
should
marry
i
should
have
pleasure
in
my
house
should
make
it
as
beautiful
as
might
be
should
gather
a
very
few
friends
about
me
i
should
not
become
morbid
the
danger
of
that
is
over
every
opportunity
i
saw
of
helping
those
less
fortunate
than
myself
i
should
gladly
seize
it
is
not
impossible
that
i
might
seek
opportunities
that
i
might
found
some
institution
of
quite
commonplace
aims
be
assured
for
instance
i
should
like
to
see
other
homes
like
ormonde
many
women
could
conduct
them
if
the
means
were
supplied
and
so
on
that
is
all
very
reasonable
it
lies
with
yourself
to
decide
whether
you
might
not
have
a
breezier
existence
in
america
but
not
with
myself
to
decide
whether
i
remain
here
or
go
back
again
i
ask
you
to
help
me
in
determining
that
annabel
stood
as
one
who
reflects
gravely
yet
collectedly
egremont
fixed
his
eyes
upon
her
until
she
looked
at
him
then
his
gaze
questioned
silently
us
understand
each
other
said
annabel
you
say
this
because
of
anything
that
has
been
in
the
past
of
it
in
continuance
of
it
we
are
both
very
different
from
what
we
were
when
that
happened
i
think
i
do
not
speak
now
as
i
did
then
yet
the
wish
i
have
is
far
more
real
they
were
more
than
up
the
ascent
it
was
after
sunset
and
the
mood
of
the
season
was
changing
the
plain
of
pevensey
lay
like
a
vision
of
fairyland
the
colouring
indescribably
delicate
unreal
bands
of
dark
green
alternated
with
the
palest
and
most
translucent
emeralds
the
long
stretch
of
the
coast
was
a
faint
outline
yet
so
clear
that
every
tongue
of
sand
every
smallest
headland
was
distinguishable
the
sky
that
rested
on
the
eastern
semicircle
of
horizon
was
rather
neutral
tint
than
blue
and
in
it
hung
long
clouds
of
the
colour
of
faded
daffodils
a
glance
overhead
gave
the
reason
of
this
wondrous
effect
of
light
there
and
away
to
the
west
brooded
a
vast
black
ragged
at
the
edge
yet
seeming
motionless
the
western
sea
was
very
night
its
gloom
intensified
by
one
slip
of
silver
shimmer
wherein
a
sail
was
revealed
the
hillside
immediately
in
front
of
those
who
stood
here
was
so
deeply
shadowed
that
its
contrast
threw
the
vision
of
unearthly
light
into
distance
immeasurable
a
wind
was
rising
but
though
its
low
whistling
sound
was
very
audible
it
seemed
to
be
in
the
upper
air
here
scarcely
a
breath
was
felt
annabel
said
you
seen
thyrza
portrait
she
raised
her
eyes
they
were
sad
compassionate
yet
smiled
could
not
have
lived
but
you
are
conscious
now
of
what
that
face
means
know
nothing
of
her
history
from
the
day
when
i
last
saw
her
except
the
mere
outward
circumstances
do
i
but
i
saw
her
once
here
and
i
have
seen
her
portrait
the
crisis
of
your
life
was
there
there
was
your
one
great
opportunity
and
you
let
it
pass
she
could
not
have
lived
but
that
is
no
matter
you
were
tried
egremont
and
found
wanting
love
for
me
did
not
continue
it
was
already
too
late
at
the
end
of
those
two
years
it
secret
knowledge
have
you
whatever
as
you
mean
it
but
it
was
not
too
late
they
were
silent
and
as
they
stood
thus
the
sky
was
again
transformed
a
steady
yet
soft
wind
from
the
northwest
was
propelling
the
great
black
cloud
seaward
over
to
france
it
moved
in
a
solid
mass
its
ragged
edges
little
by
little
broken
off
its
bulk
detached
from
the
night
which
lay
behind
it
and
in
the
sky
which
it
disclosed
rose
as
it
were
a
pale
dawn
the
restored
twilight
thereamid
glimmered
the
eastward
on
the
coast
at
the
far
end
of
pevensey
bay
the
lights
of
hastings
began
to
twinkle
out
at
sea
was
visible
a
single
gleam
appearing
and
disappearing
the
lightship
on
the
sovereign
shoals
annabel
continued
speaking
have
both
missed
something
something
that
will
never
again
he
offered
us
when
you
asked
me
to
be
your
wife
four
years
ago
at
ullswater
i
did
not
love
you
i
admired
you
i
liked
you
it
would
have
been
very
possible
to
me
to
marry
you
but
i
had
my
ideal
of
love
and
i
hoped
to
give
my
husband
something
more
than
i
felt
for
you
at
that
time
a
year
after
i
loved
you
i
suffered
when
you
were
suffering
i
was
envious
of
the
love
you
gave
to
another
woman
and
i
said
to
myself
that
the
moment
i
hoped
for
had
come
only
in
vain
since
then
i
have
changed
more
than
i
changed
in
those
twelve
months
i
am
not
in
love
with
you
now
i
can
talk
of
these
things
without
a
flutter
of
the
pulse
is
it
not
true
she
held
her
hand
to
him
baring
the
wrist
egremont
retained
the
hand
in
both
his
own
can
tell
you
you
see
she
went
on
i
know
to
be
the
truth
that
you
missed
the
great
opportunity
of
your
life
when
you
abandoned
thyrza
her
love
would
have
made
of
you
what
mine
never
could
even
though
she
herself
had
been
taken
from
you
very
soon
i
can
tell
you
the
mere
truth
you
see
dare
you
still
ask
for
me
do
ask
annabel
i
have
your
hand
and
i
keep
it
may
i
do
think
i
should
ever
give
it
to
any
other
man
the
night
was
thickening
about
them
we
go
up
to
the
head
egremont
asked
higher
she
said
it
with
a
significant
look
and
he
understood
her
