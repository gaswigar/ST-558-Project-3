introductory
if
you
stay
here
long
you
will
become
so
westernized
that
you
will
lose
all
love
for
new
england
that
my
experience
so
said
a
brawny
pioneer
a
man
of
large
mind
and
generous
heart
and
a
fist
that
never
struck
a
coward
blow
but
when
swung
in
defence
of
the
right
was
like
the
of
samson
to
the
philistines
he
had
emigrated
from
maine
twenty
years
before
and
was
one
of
the
first
settlers
i
met
on
the
prairie
near
the
scene
of
my
story
was
his
prediction
fulfilled
ah
how
like
sweetest
music
sounded
the
bells
of
salem
city
of
peace
the
first
sunday
of
my
return
to
the
old
bay
state
besides
the
frontiersman
misrepresented
himself
for
seated
by
his
ample
fireplace
how
his
eye
kindled
and
tones
mellowed
as
he
treated
us
to
reminiscences
of
his
early
days
and
what
a
grip
he
gave
the
hand
of
a
yankee
then
there
were
those
east
who
said
you
will
soon
tire
of
the
west
they
also
were
mistaken
an
invalid
with
shadowy
form
and
trembling
limbs
when
i
left
new
england
i
awakened
to
a
new
life
in
minnesota
take
a
gun
on
your
shoulders
kill
and
eat
the
wild
game
of
the
prairies
said
my
medical
friends
i
anticipated
vicissitude
and
deprivation
in
following
such
counsel
but
these
toughened
my
weak
frame
and
added
zest
to
frontier
labors
and
pleasures
for
i
was
soon
able
to
do
a
man
share
of
the
former
and
in
threading
forest
and
prairie
i
was
brought
into
delightful
nearness
to
nature
in
its
beauty
freshness
and
magnitude
and
in
visiting
the
lodge
of
the
indian
and
the
cabins
of
the
settlers
i
met
with
plenty
of
adventure
in
writing
this
work
i
have
with
peculiar
interest
lived
over
the
scenes
and
incidents
of
my
varied
frontier
experience
have
travelled
once
more
amid
the
waving
grasses
and
beckoning
flowers
heard
again
the
bark
of
the
wolf
and
the
voices
of
birds
felt
on
my
brow
the
kiss
of
the
breeze
worshipped
anew
in
the
sanctuary
yes
east
and
west
are
both
dear
to
me
one
fittingly
supplements
the
other
each
holds
the
ashes
of
kindred
by
a
singular
providence
since
this
tale
was
completed
a
relative
one
of
the
gentlest
and
most
whose
presence
ever
glorified
the
earth
has
found
a
in
the
bosom
of
the
very
prairie
i
had
in
mind
while
penning
these
pages
sent
west
by
physicians
to
save
her
life
she
reached
that
spot
in
time
to
die
thus
attaching
my
heart
to
that
soil
by
another
and
sorrowful
tie
that
east
and
west
may
be
bound
together
by
love
as
well
as
by
national
and
commercial
relations
and
that
this
story
may
tend
in
its
humble
way
to
so
happy
a
result
is

tom
jones
leaned
on
his

lost
in
thought
he
was
a
stout
lad
of
sixteen
with
frowzy
brown
hair
crowned
by
a
brimless
straw
hat
and
his
pants
looked
as
if
they
had
been
turned
inside
out
and
outside
in
upside
down
and
downside
up
and
darned
and
patched
and
and
patched
again
until
time
and
labor
and
cloth
enough
such
as
it
was
had
been
used
to
fabricate
a
number
of
pairs
of
pants
as
for
boots
for
his
lower
extremities
were
not
wholly
destitute
of
protection
they
might
have
come
down
to
him
as
an
from
a
pauper
of
a
preceding
generation
but
what
mattered
it
to
him
that
his
clothes
were
threadbare
and
grotesque
or
that
his
boots
let
the
deep
rich
soil
in
at
sides
and
toes
was
he
not
a
squatter
sovereign
or
the
son
of
one
free
in
his
habits
as
the
indian
that
roamed
the
prairies
of
his
frontier
home
he
had
not
heard
of
the
latest
fashion
and
paid
no
attention
to
the
cut
of
his
garments
although
it
must
be
confessed
he
sometimes
wished
them
a
trifle
more
spruce
and
comfortable
his
home
as
i
have
hinted
was
on
the
prairie
nevertheless
the
family
domain
was
an
unpretending
one
less
than
an
acre
fenced
in
the
rudest
manner
enclosed
the
farm
and
farm
buildings
the
latter
consisting
of
a
small
log
house
and
log
pigsty
the
cabin
at
the
time
our
sketch
opens
being
it
is
evident
at
least
two
seasons
old
a
fact
which
serves
to
show
the
more
plainly
the
poverty
and
thriftlessness
of
the
inmates
for
they
have
had
time
certainly
to
cultivate
quite
a
tract
of
the
land
had
they
enterprise
and
industry
but
they
belonged
to
a
class
not
famous
for
these
virtues
the
restless
class
that
pioneer
the
way
towards
the
setting
sun
but
perhaps
we
are
leaving
the
boy
propped
too
long
on
his
hoe
let
us
take
a
more
critical
look
at
him
fine
feathers
do
make
fine
birds
observes
the
old
proverb
forgetting
the
dress
then
please
study
his
face
a
clear
eye
eyebrows
regular
features
mouth
and
chin
indicating
decision
and
native
refinement
and
a
forehead
ah
here
may
be
a
diamond
in
the
rough
who
knows
the
squatter
son
looked
about
him
with
a
dissatisfied
air
i
do
wish
he
soliloquized
that
i
could
see
something
of
the
world
and
do
something
for
myself
here
we
been
changing
around
from
one
place
to
another
doing
nothing
but
raise
a
few
potatoes
and
a
little
corn
living
in
a
miserable
cabin
where
there
are
no
schools
and
scarcely
any
neighbors
it
too
bad
to
spend
all
our
days
so
i
believe
we
were
made
for
something
better
and
as
the
minister
told
us
sunday
we
ought
to
try
and
be
somebody
and
not
float
along
as
the
stick
on
the
stream
i
sure
it
is
and
never
was
to
mind
and
as
to
father
and
here
he
stopped
and
pondered
as
if
trying
to
solve
a
mystery
and
in
a
style
that
would
have
been
pronounced
philosophic
had
he
been
a
college
professor
scratched
his
head
then
with
his
ragged
sleeve
he
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
brow
leaving
a
streak
of
black
that
made
that
part
of
his
face
present
quite
a
different
appearance
from
what
it
did
reader
when
you
and
i
noticed
it
a
moment
ago
and
going
to
the
cabin
he
returned
with
a
rickety
basket
and
commencing
at
the
lower
end
of
the
field
began
picking
up
the
potatoes
that
had
been
left
drying
in
the
sun
a
goodly
crop
had
the
little
patch
produced
for
the
vegetable
decays
and
fertilizing
rains
and
snows
of
centuries
had
covered
the
prairie
with
a
dressing
with
which
art
could
not
compete
and
it
was
more
difficult
not
to
get
a
harvest
from
the
seed
sown
than
to
get
one
the
rows
of
hills
were
covered
with
the
bountiful
returns
brought
up
to
the
light
of
day
by
tom
hoe
it
was
not
however
the
size
quality
or
number
of
the
potatoes
that
most
interested
tom
just
then
the
fact
that
they
were
all
out
of
the
ground
that
the
corn
was
cut
and
stacked
and
the
pumpkins
ready
to
be
housed
that
the
fall
work
could
be
finished
by
that
afternoon
stirred
him
strangely
for
he
had
of
late
begun
to
question
the
future
to
learn
what
it
had
in
store
for
him
he
had
come
to
realize
in
a
degree
that
that
future
would
be
very
much
what
he
chose
to
make
it
and
serious
dissatisfaction
with
the
past
and
the
present
filled
his
heart
with
disquiet
tom
memory
had
been
active
for
a
few
days
how
like
yesterday
it
seemed
when
he
was
a
little
child
and
his
father
getting
together
money
enough
bought
a
horse
and
wagon
and
putting
the
family
in
the
vehicle
started
out
prospecting
for
a
new
home
farther
from
the
advancing
waves
of
civilization
how
many
similar
expeditions
had
they
taken
since
and
how
painfully
had
their
experiences
illustrated
the
saying
a
rolling
stone
gathers
no
moss
but
roll
jones
would
tom
knew
this
too
well
it
was
indeed
viewed
in
one
aspect
an
easy
way
to
get
on
this
going
in
one
own
conveyance
from
place
to
place
of
uncle
sam
unsettled
lands
this
living
off
the
country
gypsying
in
the
woods
and
on
the
prairies
this
two
thirds
savage
and
one
third
civilized
mode
of
putting
a
growing
family
through
the
world
and
if
you
were
to
see
jones
seated
in
the
emigrant
wagon
reins
in
hand
and
pipe
in
mouth
or
with
shouldered
rifle
on
the
track
of
a
deer
you
would
say
that
such
a
life
was
eminently
agreeable
to
him
every
man
is
made
for
something
and
you
would
say
that
he
was
cut
out
for
a
wandering
frontier
loafer
who
gets
his
subsistence
by
doing
the
least
possible
work
in
the
easiest
possible
manner
and
hunting
and
fishing
a
horse
and
wagon
or
extemporized
log
cabin
for
a
shelter
tools
enough
for
the
simplest
tilling
of
the
soil
and
furniture
for
the
rudest
housekeeping
and
clothing
the
making
over
by
the
industrious
wife
of
clothes
bought
some
time
back
such
was
the
way
the
joneses
lived
putting
up
a
small
log
house
by
the
bank
of
a
river
for
the
sake
of
the
fish
and
near
a
forest
for
the
game
with
a
strip
of
clean
prairie
for
garden
sarce
there
they
might
remain
for
a
year
or
two
then
you
would
be
quite
sure
to
find
the
immigrant
friend
looking
discontented
and
expressing
a
wish
to
sell
his
claim
it
growing
so
crowded
with
folks
coming
into
the
country
i
go
three
miles
without
stumbling
against
a
shanty
or
a
house
and
cart
tracks
are
getting
so
plenty
i
ca
stand
it
i
must
pull
up
stakes
and
go
farther
on
to
find
a
place
to
breathe
in
and
perchance
realizing
a
trifle
for
his
claim
and
improvements
dobbin
is
hitched
anew
into
the
crazy
old
wagon
the
broken
crockery
and
leaky
black
and
ancient
the
pipe
of
the
latter
running
up
through
the
are
once
more
aboard
wife
and
children
packed
in
and
the
uneasy
frontiersman
is
pushing
out
again
towards
solitude
tom
had
been
reviewing
this
bit
of
family
history
more
in
detail
and
much
more
vividly
than
we
have
now
done
the
result
was
a
feeling
of
disgust
and
a
resolution
to
break
away
from
such
a
life
and
an
endeavor
for
something
higher
but
what
had
brought
the
squatter
son
to
such
a
conclusion
the
condition
of
the
family
had
for
some
time
been
unsatisfactory
to
tom
though
brought
up
in
this
roving
improvident
way
his
better
nature
often
revolted
against
it
not
however
so
strongly
and
decisively
as
now
still
desires
and
even
longings
for
something
better
had
flitted
through
his
mind
only
to
make
him
moody
and
irritable
doubtless
these
aspirations
were
due
in
no
small
measure
to
his
mother
a
woman
much
superior
to
her
condition
but
who
clinging
to
her
husband
with
a
pure
and
changeless
love
accepted
the
privations
of
her
lot
without
a
murmur
taken
by
her
marriage
from
the
comforts
and
advantages
of
a
good
home
she
had
followed
his
fortunes
for
better
or
for
worse
having
much
more
of
the
latter
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
than
the
former
not
that
jones
was
a
hard
or
a
dissipated
man
but
his
roving
habits
and
the
deprivations
and
poverty
they
endured
had
made
her
days
sad
and
tom
in
his
tastes
was
like
his
mother
but
a
new
event
had
recently
occurred
a
godly
minister
in
search
of
the
lost
sheep
of
the
heavenly
fold
had
made
his
way
into
the
region
and
the
sabbath
previous
to
the
opening
of
our
sketch
had
in
earnest
eloquent
words
preached
the
gospel
to
the
settlers
the
log
cabin
in
which
the
services
were
held
was
only
a
mile
and
a
half
distant
and
tom
and
his
father
with
the
neighbors
generally
attended
how
differently
the
gospel
message
affects
different
persons
some
are
softened
others
are
hardened
by
it
some
are
stirred
up
to
certain
duties
while
under
the
same
sermon
others
are
incited
to
an
entirely
different
train
of
thought
and
course
of
action
the
effect
on
tom
of
the
sermons
of
the
preacher
was
to
incite
his
feelings
to
revolt
against
his
lot
in
life
and
arouse
him
to
the
necessity
of
a
purpose
in
living
he
did
not
look
forward
so
much
to
the
world
to
come
as
to
the
to
come
of
this
world
the
present
in
its
relations
to
life
here
this
was
the
point
with
him
and
he
revolved
the
subject
viewing
it
in
every
possible
light
until
a
decision
was
reached
this
preacher
said
he
is
from
a
region
of
schools
and
privileges
why
can
i
not
seek
such
advantages
and
be
somebody
and
accomplish
something
why
can
i
not
go
to
the
city
to
school
this
winter
what
an
idea
for
him
it
almost
took
his
breath
to
think
of
it
and
then
how
should
he
get
there
where
was
the
money
coming
from
to
support
him
while
studying
i
must
work
and
earn
it
he
replied
i
can
do
anything
honest
i
can
at
least
work
for
my
board
tom
mind
had
suffered
from
a
famine
of
knowledge
he
could
read
passably
well
write
a
little
was
good
at
reckoning
and
the
little
he
knew
excited
a
craving
for
more
public
addresses
had
always
moved
him
deeply
and
the
living
truths
of
the
gospel
as
presented
by
the
living
preacher
had
set
the
mental
machinery
in
motion
until
the
decision
to
go
from
home
in
search
of
an
education
had
been
wrought
out
and
it
was
this
rising
purpose
that
kept
him
so
patiently
at
his
day
task
of
finishing
up
the
fall
work
that
he
might
commence
his
new
career
i
will
finish
getting
in
the
crops
by
dark
said
he
as
he
filled
the
basket
and
then
there
will
be
nothing
to
keep
me
at
home
and
he
was
about
raising
the
basket
to
his
shoulder
when
he
was
startled
from
his
reveries
by
a
loud
cry
of
tom
tom
come
quick
i
caught
a
fawn
and
he
get
away
it
was
charley
from
the
hazel
bushes
that
bordered
the
near
the
woods
tom
ran
to
assist
his
brother
but
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
when
he
saw
the
little
fellow
had
caught
the
fawn
by
the
tail
and
was
struggling
to
hold
the
agile
creature
forgetting
how
dexterously
the
deer
can
use
his
heels
scarcely
had
the
elder
brother
mounted
the
fence
when
with
a
smart
kick
the
fawn
sent
charley
over
on
his
back
and
leaped
into
the
enclosure
at
this
instant
a
bevy
of
urchins
hatless
bonnetless
brothers
and
sisters
came
whooping
from
the
cabin
and
joined
the
chase
in
a
moment
tom
had
forgotten
all
his
gloomy
thoughts
and
high
resolves
and
was
as
eager
as
any
of
them
as
they
tried
to
secure
the
nimble
prize
a
lively
time
it
was
too
fear
and
speed
against
numbers
noise
and
strategy
a
good
force
were
the
pursuers
the
olive
plants
of
the
joneses
grew
very
naturally
in
regular
gradations
like
the
steps
of
a
flight
of
stairs
tom
eliza
charley
bob
sarah
bill
and
bub
the
were
all
active
with
hands
legs
and
lungs
while
the
mother
stood
in
the
doorway
surveying
the
scene
with
baby
in
her
arms
fix
up
the
fence
where
the
deer
jumped
in
cried
tom
to
charley
and
the
latter
hastened
to
repair
the
breach
for
the
brush
had
been
broken
down
at
that
point
from
corner
to
corner
and
side
to
side
bounded
the
deer
slipping
through
the
fingers
of
one
and
another
of
the
youngsters
but
they
gave
him
no
rest
stop
him
hold
him
bob
head

help

he
get
away
there
he
going
over
the
fence
no
he
is
amid
such
vociferations
the
children
rushed
on
till
out
of
breath
luckily
the
brush
fence
was
so
thick
and
high
being
made
of
dead
trees
piled
upon
each
other
that
the
animal
could
find
no
point
to
push
through
or
scale
especially
while
kept
in
running
order
by
his
pursuers
although
thus
imprisoned
he
was
baffling
their
efforts
refusing
to
be
captured
when
tom
said
to
the
children
we
ca
catch
him
this
way
but
if
you
will
all
do
as
i
tell
you
i
guess
we
can
the
fawn
was
standing
in
the
further
corner
of
the
field
as
if
waiting
to
see
what
they
would
do
next
and
tom
ranging
his
force
in
line
himself
at
the
head
gave
the
word
to
advance
towards
the
deer
steady
steady
said
he
as
they
neared
the
animal
they
had
succeeded
in
approaching
within
a
few
yards
and
tom
with
outspread
arms
and
eagle
eye
advanced
slowly
watching
to
seize
him
if
he
should
attempt
to
spring
away
when
little
bub
who
had
been
sent
into
the
cabin
by
tom
having
gone
around
unobserved
on
the
outside
of
the
garden
behind
the
deer
suddenly
ran
a
sharp
stick
through
the
brush
into
the
creature
back
saying
i
make
wun
frantically
jumped
the
deer
at
this
a
so
unexpected
to
his
assailants
that
the
line
became
broken
the
little
soldiers
were
tumbled
together
with
tom
on
top
of
them
and
the
deer
stood
almost
at
the
same
instant
at
the
other
end
of
the
patch
the
whole
being
accomplished
with
marvellous
quickness
get
off
my
head
screamed
sarah
from
under
the
heap
o
dear
you
break
my
arm
cried
eliza
what
did
you
fall
on
me
for
angrily
demanded
bob
of
charley
as
he
spit
the
dirt
from
his
mouth
you
did
it
on
purpose
you
know
you
did
no
i
did
yes
you
did
i
should
a
thought
tom
might
a
held
the
deer
an
not
fell
on
us
so
heavy
sobbed
sarah
rubbing
her
eyes
with
her
begrimed
gown
but
while
they
fretted
the
fawn
had
been
critically
examining
the
fence
to
find
egress
seeing
which
the
children
dried
their
tears
and
made
for
him
again
and
at
length
the
graceful
creature
bewildered
by
the
din
and
foiled
by
numbers
was
forced
to
surrender
himself
after
another
vigorous
scramble
in
which
the
basket
of
potatoes
was
overturned
and
the
corn
scattered
in
delightful
disorder
and
was
borne
by
tom
in
triumph
to
the
cabin
accompanied
by
the
excited
group
we
got
him
marm
we
got
him
they
shouted
in
chorus
as
they
followed
their
leader
into
the
house
and
where
will
you
keep
him
she
inquired
he
tan
seep
with
me
promptly
answered
bub
at
which
there
was
much
merriment
no
replied
tom
shaking
his
head
at
the
you
will
stick
a
stick
into
his
back
and
wun
again
after
much
deliberation
it
was
decided
that
the
fawn
be
tied
to
a
while
a
pen
was
built
for
his
accommodation
near
the
cabin
this
was
soon
accomplished
and
the
fawn
placed
in
it
when
tom
returned
to
his
work
the
day
was
far
gone
he
gazed
around
with
regret
as
he
saw
that
not
only
was
it
now
too
late
to
finish
getting
in
the
crops
but
that
the
chase
of
the
deer
in
which
he
had
engaged
with
so
much
ardor
had
made
him
no
little
extra
labor
what
a
task
it
would
be
to
find
all
the
potatoes
scattered
and
trampled
into
the
rich
earth
as
they
were
and
the
bundles
of
corn
had
been
broken
from
their
bindings
and
must
be
gathered
together
and
refastened
to
find
and
carry
in
the
potatoes
consumed
the
time
till
supper
and
then
at
his
mother
call
he
went
in
depressed
and
unhappy
and
after
bringing
in
the
wood
for
the
breakfast
fire
and
feeding
the
pigs
he
went
up
the
rude
ladder
to
his
straw
bed
on
the
floor
it
was
scanty
fare
that
the
jones
family
had
you
could
see
that
by
their
looks
it
is
true
that
they
were
healthy
and
strong
but
they
lacked
the
fair
plump
development
that
plenty
of
food
of
a
suitable
variety
gives
to
childhood
and
youth
of
vegetables
they
were
not
destitute
potatoes
corn
beans
and
pumpkins
they
had
in
abundance
since
fall
set
in
if
not
before
bread
milk
and
meat
were
usually
scarce
with
them
for
the
latter
they
depended
principally
on
the
father
rifle
but
as
he
was
apt
to
take
wide
and
eccentric
tramps
over
the
prairies
there
would
be
long
intervals
when
but
little
game
from
his
gun
made
savory
the
family
cooking
jones
had
been
away
for
some
days
now
and
his
patient
wife
had
really
suffered
for
food
vegetables
of
the
same
kind
served
up
pretty
much
in
the
same
way
with
little
to
give
relish
to
them
a
big
crying
infant
the
while
tugging
at
her
breast
and
the
to
do
it
is
not
strange
that
while
the
children
fresh
from
romping
in
the
bracing
prairie
air
were
favored
with
a
ravenous
appetite
she
had
little
tom
understood
all
this
for
constituted
like
her
he
too
felt
the
deprivations
of
the
table
although
in
a
less
degree
and
much
did
he
worry
about
her
meagre
diet
ah
he
thought
as
he
lay
down
for
the
night
when
i
am
away
and
earning
wo
i
send
the
good
things
to

chapter
ii
shooting
a
frontier
doctor
tom
slept
soundly
and
notwithstanding
he
charged
his
memory
to
awaken
him
before
daybreak
dawn
was
brightening
the
east
while
he
was
still
in
the
shadowy
land
of
dreams
the
low
attic
had
no
window
save
a
pane
of
glass
nailed
over
a
hole
under
the
eaves
and
long
the
lad
might
have
slumbered
on
had
not
a
loud
sound
suddenly
aroused
him
does
it
thunder
he
exclaimed
fearing
a
prairie
tempest
had
arisen
to
interfere
with
his
cherished
project
of
leaving
home
peering
through
the
window
pane
he
saw
to
his
surprise
that
the
morning
was
cloudless
what
could
it
mean
assuredly
he
had
heard
the
rolling
of
thunder
he
looked
out
again
for
another
and
more
agreeable
thought
had
struck
him
yes
it
the
hens
he
ejaculated
my
what
a
heap
of
them
by
the
hens
he
meant
prairie
hens
for
in
this
familiar
way
they
are
spoken
of
at
the
west
they
had
spied
out
the
corn
and
the
fact
that
it
was
there
by
some
telegraphic
system
in
vogue
among
the
birds
had
spread
for
miles
around
and
making
their
way
through
the
tall
grass
from
every
direction
at
once
as
the
sun
appeared
they
flew
in
a
huge
body
over
the
little
cabin
into
the
field
for
this
species
of
grouse
are
models
of
good
order
and
punctuality
as
to
their
meals
and
many
an
boy
or
girl
might
we
suspect
get
a
useful
hint
from
them
on
table
etiquette
they
assemble
as
if
by
appointment
around
the
farmer
and
quietly
wait
for
the
breakfast
signal
which
is
the
rising
of
the
sun
then
enter
the
enclosure
together
and
having
fed
just
one
hour
by
their
unerring
chronometer
they
retire
to
return
at
sunset
for
another
hour
feeding
this
was
their
first
visit
to
patch
doubtless
the
trampled
and
scattered
corn
had
tempted
them
in
now
tom
eyes
danced
for
joy
as
peeping
at
the
hens
he
hurried
on
his
clothes
hundreds
were
there
pecking
along
like
so
many
turkeys
it
was
the
combined
whirr
of
their
wings
that
woke
him
so
effectually
many
an
older
person
on
the
frontier
has
been
deceived
by
the
same
sound
supposing
it
to
be
thunder
so
heavy
a
noise
do
these
wild
fowl
of
the
prairies
make
when
numbers
of
them
fly
together
wo
mother
be
glad
he
whispered
to
himself
and
what
a
dinner
she
have
and
descending
the
ladder
he
took
from
the
hooked
pegs
overhead
his
father
old
where
it
had
hung
unused
for
months
and
from
a
little
box
some
powder
and
shot
and
a
percussion
cap
then
loading
in
haste
he
rested
the
weapon
on
the
that
he
might
take
steady
aim
and
fired
at
the
fowl
a
terrible
report
followed
and
tom
came
to
himself
to
find
his
mother
bathing
his
forehead
and
his
sisters
crying
the
gun
was
out
of
order
and
being
also
overloaded
had
blown
off
the
lock
burning
his
face
and
stunning
him
by
the
recoil
poor
tom
returned
to
consciousness
to
suffer
his
face
began
rapidly
to
swell
and
presented
a
frightful
appearance
so
blackened
was
it
by
the
powder
and
the
smarting
was
intense
jones
in
her
isolated
life
had
been
too
many
times
thrown
on
her
own
resources
to
be
wholly
overcome
by
the
disaster
her
chief
anxiety
was
lest
tom
eyes
were
destroyed
as
the
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
had
been
completely
burned
off
by
the
explosion
when
she
saw
however
that
he
was
not
blind
she
said
with
tears
o
how
glad
i
am
dear
child
that
your
eyes
are
spared
a
couple
of
miles
away
lived
a
doctor
or
an
individual
who
wore
that
title
on
whom
in
emergencies
the
scattered
settlers
were
wont
to
call
this
queer
æsculapian
specimen
was
remarkably
tall
and
lank
always
went
with
his
pants
tucked
in
the
tops
of
his
thumping
cowhide
boots
and
wore
a
red
woollen
shirt
the
soiled
and
limpsy
of
which
coming
nearly
to
his
ears
served
instead
of
a
collar
he
dwelt
alone
with
his
cat
in
a
rude
sleeping
with
his
window
open
and
door
unfastened
and
if
his
services
were
needed
in
the
night
the
messenger
would
put
his
head
in
at
the
window
and
call
to
him
or
pull
the
and
walk
in
the
doctor
was
pompous
in
conversation
and
affected
long
words
but
it
was
understood
unfortunately
for
his
patients
that
his
advantages
had
been
poor
for
this
worthy
charley
had
been
promptly
despatched
by
his
mother
and
good
time
did
the
child
make
so
frightened
was
he
about
poor
tom
he
was
an
imaginative
lad
and
when
much
excited
apt
to
see
two
hundred
black
cats
fighting
in
the
yard
when
there
was
only
a
frolicsome
kitten
chasing
its
tail
and
at
such
times
he
had
the
bad
habit
of
running
his
words
together
he
was
just
the
one
to
send
on
the
errand
so
far
as
speed
was
concerned
but
when
he
burst
into
the
doctor
cabin
shouting
the
slumbering
man
of
herbs
prematurely
awakened
rubbed
his
forehead
to
be
sure
he
was
not
dreaming
and
stammered
to
pay
off
reiterated
the
urchin
boy
said
the
doctor
now
fully
aroused
be
and
collected
and
state
distinctly
what
has
happened
and
holding
the
lad
by
the
shoulders
he
added
speak
very
slowly
that
i
may
understand
you
blew
his
head
off
emphatically
repeated
charley
pausing
after
each
word
a
shocking
occurrence
truly
ejaculated
the
physician
i
do
not
wonder
boy
that
one
so
unaccustomed
to
such
sanguinary
events
should
be
terrified
but
who
is
the
unfortunate
victim
of
this
tragical
and
fatal
accident
or
was
he
murdered
in
cold
blood
yes
sir
replied
charley
who
in
turn
did
not
understand
the
doctor
but
supposed
he
must
assent
to
all
he
said
yes
what
sharply
asked
the
physician
was
it
i
say
an
accident
or
was
the
man
assassinated
be
quick
now
yesir
instantly
screamed
charley
thinking
the
doctor
was
now
reproving
him
for
speaking
slowly
well
you
scared
out
of
your
seven
senses
you
wretched
dunce
retorted
the
doctor
out
of
temper
and
shaking
the
lad
he
said
see
if
you
can
tell
me
now
who
it
is
that
killed
it
our
tom
and
how
do
know
who
your
tom
is
roared
the
physician
tom
and
he
pointed
to
a
monstrous
gray
cat
that
sat
on
an
oak
chest
watching
the
boy
with
eyes
and
if
he
should
mistake
you
for
a
thieving
gopher
some
fine
morning
and
eat
you
up
alive
small
loss
would
it
be
to
the
world
i
thinking
he
my
brother
timidly
interposed
charley
keeping
to
the
question
your
brother
well
old
hunter
what
do
you
say
to
that
said
the
doctor
stroking
his
disagreeable
pet
that
uncombed
ignoramus
of
a
boy
claims
you
for
a
relative
do
you
realize
the
honor
eh
i
mean
that
tom
is
my
brother
explained
charley
bursting
into
tears
the
doctor
softened
by
his
distress
asked
more
gently
but
has
your
tom
any
other
name
no
sir
answered
the
boy
well
what
is
name
charley
charley
what
charley
jones
o
i
see
you
belong
to
the
jones
tribe
not
much
matter
if
all
their
heads
were
blown
off
but
what
do
you
want
of
me
mother
wants
you
to
come
right
down
quick
and
make
tom
well
what
after
his
head
blown
off
that
a
job
anyhow
young
man
he
be
would
he
going
round
well
as
ever
without
any
head
on
his
shoulders
but
i
see
how
it
is
his
head
is
all
gone
just
a
trifle
left
enough
to
grow
another
with
and
the
doctor
now
in
good
humor
succeeded
in
drawing
from
the
lad
an
intelligible
account
of
the
accident
and
mounting
his
horse
with
behind
him
and
a
tin
pail
in
his
hand
he
proceeded
to
a
settler
and
narrating
the
accident
with
nearly
as
much
exaggeration
as
did
little
charley
he
added
with
an
emphatic
jerk
of
his
collar
i
fix
the
fellow
up
so
that
he
be
as
good
as
new
he
then
begged
some
yeast
and
a
roll
of
cotton
batting
and
repairing
to
the
joneses
covered
tom
face
with
the
cotton
dipped
in
the
yeast
and
returned
to
his
loggery
whether
the
application
was
in
accordance
with
the
of
orthodox
practice
or
not
after
a
short
time
the
pain
subsided
and
tom
dropped
into
a
peaceful
sleep
seeing
which
jones
went
about
her
morning
work
with
a
thankful
heart
the
children
had
had
nothing
to
eat
as
yet
and
now
that
their
brother
moanings
had
ceased
they
realized
that
they
were
hungry
ta
i
have
my
supper
sobbed
bub
clinging
to
his
mother
dress
as
she
walked
is
supper
it
breakfast
answered
bob
giving
the
child
a
push
which
helped
him
cry
the
louder
cripsy
mocked
bob
making
ugly
faces
at
the
little
fellow
for
fasting
had
made
bob
quarrelsome
jones
tried
in
vain
to
quiet
them
carrying
and
nursing
baby
and
preparing
the
meal
at
the
same
time
for
even
the
older
children
were
cross
as
unfed
cubs
jones
was
no
disciplinarian
she
was
too
to
command
her
offspring
if
she
ruled
at
all
it
was
by
affection
and
tact
in
this
instance
she
set
the
older
ones
at
work
one
she
directed
to
replenish
the
fire
another
to
wash
the
potatoes
a
third
to
sweep
the
floor
a
slow
job
the
latter
was
as
the
truncheon
or
floor
of
split
logs
was
jagged
and
the
broom
worn
nearly
to
the
handle
she
suggested
to
charley
to
see
if
the
fawn
had
got
away
which
had
the
effect
of
causing
bub
to
go
on
the
same
mission
this
stratagem
however
did
not
avail
much
in
the
case
of
charley
who
quickly
saw
through
his
mother
device
and
returned
exclaiming
pooh
i
guess
the
fawn
all
right
but
bub
found
congenial
occupation
in
teasing
the
fawn
the
pen
was
narrow
and
bub
not
being
able
to
reach
the
deer
and
tired
of
shouting
at
him
started
off
into
the
field
for
a
famous
long
stick
which
had
served
him
for
a
steed
the
day
before
as
he
looked
for
it
among
the
corn
he
saw
something
flutter
then
heard
a
curious
cackle
it
was
a
prairie
hen
whose
wings
had
been
broken
by
shot
from
gun
the
bird
moved
painfully
away
trying
to
hide
behind
the
leafy
stalks
but
bub
bright
eyes
could
not
be
eluded
and
he
followed
after
calling
chick
chick
chick
mistaking
it
for
a
domestic
fowl
the
cunning
bird
dodged
in
and
out
among
the
standing
and
prostrate
stacks
with
marvellous
swiftness
considering
its
condition
but
persevering
seized
the
hen
at
last
by
the
neck
saying
exultantly
i
dot
yer
now
you
the
strong
wild
fowl
struggled
desperately
scratching
his
chubby
hand
until
it
bled
but
bub
trudged
on
with
his
prize
into
the
cabin
saying
as
he
entered
see
marm
i
totched
a
biddy
the
little
captor
entrance
was
greeted
with
shouts
of
delight
on
the
part
of
the
children
and
by
a
loving
kiss
from
his
mother
for
bub
was
a
great
favorite
and
a
manly
wee
boy
despite
his
blubbering
in
which
he
excelled
on
occasions
and
his
mischievious
pranks
in
which
also
he
was
the
equal
of
bubs
of
more
civilized
communities
as
he
stood
in
the
cabin
door
coolly
holding
the
kicking
prairie
hen
heedless
of
its
cruel
claws
his
torn
and
soiled
surmounted
by
a
round
fat
face
bright
blue
eyes
and
light
hair
falling
in
tangled
ringlets
the
golden
sun
resting
upon
his
bare
head
and
lighting
up
his
dimpled
cheek
he
formed
a
picture
worthy
the
pencil
of
an
artist
what
a
little
man
you
are
exclaimed
the
mother
taking
the
heavy
fowl
from
him
you
shall
have
some
nice
breakfast
for
this
and
she
put
a
baked
potato
and
a
piece
of
on
the
corner
of
a
trunk
and
while
bub
with
a
satisfied
hum
partook
of
the
food
she
quietly
slipped
out
of
doors
and
wrung
the
hen
neck
the
children
plied
the
little
hero
with
questions
as
to
where
and
how
he
caught
the
hen
which
he
took
his
own
time
to
answer
while
he
munched
then
they
rushed
out
in
a
body
hoping
to
find
another
their
search
was
successful
and
they
brought
back
two
which
they
found
lying
some
distance
apart
quite
dead
the
old
gun
had
scattered
prodigiously
but
as
the
flock
of
hens
was
so
large
did
good
execution
as
appeared
from
the
result
tom
was
asleep
on
his
mother
bed
which
occupied
a
corner
of
the
one
room
but
aroused
by
the
din
which
greeted
bub
when
he
came
in
with
the
biddy
regarded
the
affair
quite
complacently
although
he
said
nothing
and
as
the
hens
were
being
picked
by
and
sarah
he
was
comforted
by
the
reflection
that
his
attempt
at
gunning
had
brought
the
family
something
to
eat
tom
indeed
had
never
seen
fowl
prepared
for
the
household
under
just
such
circumstances
and
he
watched
each
step
in
the
process
with
peculiar
interest
jones
with
a
fond
mother
quickness
understood
well
how
he
felt
and
though
she
seemed
not
to
notice
him
made
unusual
parade
in
all
that
was
done
be
very
careful
of
those
feathers
girls
why
how
thick
and
soft
they
are
we
save
every
one
and
who
knows
but
when
tom
gets
well
he
contrive
some
traps
and
catch
hens
enough
to
make
a
pair
of
pillows
or
a
is
a
very
nice
asked
sarah
very
when
the
weather
is
cold
and
a
body
is
weakly
as
tom
is
now
it
so
easy
to
rest
upon
there
eliza
you
may
pass
me
the
one
that
is
picked
and
i
dress
it
how
fat
it
is
and
so
tender
what
a
feast
we
shall
have
how
thankful
we
ought
to
be
that
tom
eyes
were
not
put
out
when
he
shot
these
hens
how
good
he
was
to
think
of
getting
them
for
us
i
hope
girls
you
help
him
all
you
can
when
he
gets
about
and
not
let
him
do
all
the
chores
jones
was
very
handy
at
such
work
and
she
took
care
to
face
the
bed
so
that
he
might
see
every
part
of
the
operation
there
the
heart
and
there
the
liver
sweet
as
a
nut
and
she
smelled
of
them
with
the
air
of
an
epicure
we
must
keep
them
by
themselves
for
the
present
then
deftly
jointing
the
fowl
she
put
the
parts
to
soak
in
cold
water
strongly
salted
that
will
take
out
the
taste
said
she
how
i
do
wish
tom
could
eat
some
of
this
when
it
is
cooked
it
will
be
so
strengthening
but
i
guess
if
nothing
happens
the
doctor
will
let
him
have
a
taste
chapter
iii
where
can
he
be
a
heart
revelation
where
can
he
be
sighed
jones
as
she
looked
anxiously
out
of
the
little
cabin
window
many
times
a
day
had
she
done
the
same
save
that
she
the
question
but
did
not
utter
it
as
now
her
husband
had
been
away
for
more
than
a
week
and
no
tidings
from
him
what
could
it
mean
when
would
he
return
had
any
evil
befallen
him
these
and
similar
inquiries
were
continually
arising
in
her
mind
filling
her
with
disquiet
she
was
one
of
those
persons
who
are
given
to
presentiments
and
who
when
they
are
under
the
spell
of
a
deep
controlling
conviction
that
something
unusual
is
to
transpire
a
persuasion
that
comes
to
them
not
through
reason
or
evidence
or
the
probabilities
of
things
but
as
some
express
it
as
if
a
voice
had
spoken
to
them
when
no
human
being
was
near
or
by
a
secret
whispering
to
the
soul
by
some
unseen
and
seemingly
superhuman
authority
when
she
had
such
a
presentiment
it
never
deceived
her
for
some
time
she
had
foreboded
trouble
the
foreboding
grew
upon
her
till
its
dark
shadow
cast
a
gloom
upon
all
her
feelings
it
thrilled
her
at
times
with
fear
she
would
start
at
the
veriest
trifles
as
if
affrighted
particularly
at
night
did
she
cower
under
the
feeling
and
of
late
it
had
been
hard
for
her
to
sleep
and
when
she
slept
it
was
wakefully
often
would
she
start
up
and
look
around
to
see
that
all
was
right
then
fall
asleep
again
and
yet
she
did
not
apprehend
danger
to
herself
particularly
sometimes
she
feared
for
her
husband
but
the
growing
feeling
was
that
trouble
for
the
settlers
was
at
hand
and
a
terrible
fear
of
the
indians
rested
upon
her
it
was
far
into
the
night
now
and
the
lone
watcher
felt
too
uneasy
to
retire
the
moon
shone
with
great
brilliancy
and
she
sat
without
a
light
busying
herself
with
some
coarse
sewing
the
children
were
peacefully
sleeping
and
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
save
their
breathing
and
the
whisper
of
the
wind
outside
the
silence
was
painful
to
her
and
she
arose
and
peered
out
of
the
window
again
everything
looked
weird
and
ghastly
what
a
solitude
for
miles
over
the
smooth
prairie
not
a
human
habitation
was
to
be
seen
in
the
other
direction
stood
the
mysterious
forest
how
black
and
dismal
seemed
the
trunks
of
the
trees
in
the
shimmering
moonbeams
she
gazed
timidly
at
their
indistinct
outlines
with
strained
eye
how
foolish
i
am
she
murmured
but
as
she
turned
from
the
window
her
attention
was
fixed
once
more
upon
the
forest
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
dark
object
moved
along
its
outskirts
it
only
the
trees
she
said
striving
to
reassure
herself
but
in
a
moment
more
an
ox
appeared
then
a
dark
figure
followed
and
another
and
another
walking
in
single
file
as
the
strange
procession
emerged
more
fully
into
view
she
saw
that
the
forms
behind
the
ox
were
those
of
indians
they
were
driving
off
the
cattle
as
their
route
lay
near
the
cabin
fear
that
they
would
pay
her
a
visit
for
a
moment
quite
paralyzed
her
it
was
but
for
a
moment
however
the
instinct
of
the
mother
was
roused
her
children
might
be
murdered
she
glanced
again
at
the
advancing
savages
and
then
softly
opening
the
door
which
fortunately
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
cabin
she
returned
with
the
axe
the
only
weapon
of
defence
at
hand
and
with
flashing
eyes
and
a
deadly
resolution
depicted
on
her
face
which
seemed
turned
to
marble
silently
awaited
the
onslaught
but
the
savages
in
their
soft
moccasins
glided
noiselessly
by
like
so
many
snakes
they
did
not
appear
to
notice
the
cabin
and
were
soon
out
of
sight
when
they
were
gone
jones
sat
down
feeling
as
weak
as
before
she
had
felt
strong
the
reaction
was
too
great
and
a
faintness
coming
on
her
head
sank
upon
the
side
of
the
bed
where
tom
lay
this
aroused
him
and
he
called
repeatedly
mother
mother
hush
she
whispered
at
last
they
hear
you
who
whispered
tom
alarmed
the
mother
kept
perfectly
still
listening
intently
until
satisfied
that
the
danger
was
really
past
then
she
related
to
her
son
what
she
had
seen
and
what
her
fears
had
been
but
mother
said
tom
confidently
there
are
no
signs
of
trouble
from
them
they
would
dare
to
attack
the
settlers
for
they
have
always
been
beaten
by
the
white
man
besides
there
are
not
many
near
us
you
see
that
these
have
not
harmed
us
they
only
stole
an
ox
why
mother
do
you
know
that
there
has
been
no
indian
war
for
a
good
many
years
and
that
the
indians
have
been
growing
weaker
and
weaker
all
the
time
and
going
farther
and
farther
off
this
was
plausible
and
tom
only
expressed
the
views
of
the
settlers
jones
knew
that
there
was
no
reason
for
her
anxiety
except
her
fears
and
she
had
not
ventured
to
express
them
to
any
one
before
for
she
was
aware
such
was
the
prevalent
feeling
on
this
subject
that
it
would
expose
her
to
ridicule
but
now
she
only
shook
her
head
and
said
i
wish
your
father
was
safe
at
home
why
mother
you
do
worry
about
him
do
you
exclaimed
tom
in
amazement
the
indians
always
liked
him
and
he
can
go
anywhere
over
the
prairies
and
through
the
woods
without
guide
or
compass
and
not
get
lost
and
he
a
great
marksman
you
know
it
would
do
for
an
indian
to
get
in
the
way
of
his
rifle
but
tom
said
the
mother
taking
his
hand
and
suddenly
changing
the
subject
why
is
it
that
you
do
get
better
faster
your
skin
is
real
hot
and
you
look
feverish
the
doctor
said
you
ought
to
have
been
out
before
this
tom
looked
down
but
did
not
reply
tom
continued
she
tenderly
something
is
troubling
your
mind
i
have
known
it
for
some
time
do
you
love
your
mother
well
enough
to
make
her
your
confidant
what
is
the
matter
my
son
still
the
lad
did
not
reply
but
his
heart
was
deeply
moved
by
this
unexpected
and
loving
attack
upon
the
citadel
that
held
his
secret
secure
as
he
had
supposed
soon
the
tears
began
to
stream
from
his
eyes
and
he
sobbed
aloud
jones
eyes
closed
and
her
lips
moved
as
if
she
were
in
prayer
upon
which
tom
after
she
had
ceased
asked
softly
mother
are
you
a
christian
that
is
a
serious
question
my
son
said
she
i
sometimes
hope
that
i
am
one
but
it
is
a
great
thing
to
be
a
true
follower
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
but
why
do
you
ask
o
replied
he
embarrassed
i
do
just
know
why
i
know
enough
to
be
a
christian
but
you
never
spoke
to
us
children
about
it
and
i
did
know
what
to
think
jones
seemed
pained
by
the
answer
and
said
tom
i
know
i
have
been
negligent
in
this
matter
then
she
added
hesitatingly
but
your
father
does
not
feel
as
i
do
about
it
and
i
have
scarcely
felt
like
instructing
the
children
contrary
to
his
views
i
have
ever
tried
to
please
him
in
everything
perhaps
i
have
carried
this
too
far
mother
were
you
praying
just
now
yes
said
she
hesitatingly
and
were
you
praying
for
me
yes
my
son
tom
was
silent
for
a
while
and
then
said
mother
since
i
heard
the
preacher
i
have
many
times
wished
i
were
a
christian
that
is
if
if
the
bible
is
true
but
there
are
some
things
that
i
do
understand
and
they
are
right
in
my
way
what
are
they
tom
he
colored
and
said
i
do
like
to
tell
you
for
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
me
very
bad
but
i
thought
some
time
i
would
like
to
ask
some
one
about
it
who
knows
more
than
i
do
you
believe
that
there
is
a
god
mother
with
all
my
heart
and
that
he
is
pleased
with
those
who
do
good
and
angry
with
those
who
do
wrong
certainly
tom
well
it
seems
hard
if
this
is
true
that
he
should
let
me
get
hurt
so
the
other
morning
as
i
was
trying
to
shoot
the
hens
for
you
and
you
needed
them
so
much
when
there
jo
priest
and
ever
so
many
more
swearing
ugly
fellows
that
go
a
gunning
almost
all
the
time
and
kill
things
just
for
the
fun
of
it
and
they
get
plenty
of
game
and
never
get
injured
and
the
lad
spoke
bitterly
my
child
said
the
mother
there
are
many
things
hard
to
be
understood
about
god
dealings
with
us
and
i
am
afraid
that
a
great
part
of
them
seem
harder
than
they
really
are
because
we
are
so
ignorant
but
you
know
how
i
am
situated
i
do
hear
any
preaching
nor
see
those
that
do
very
often
and
it
not
to
be
expected
that
i
can
clear
up
these
things
as
they
can
i
wish
interrupted
tom
petulantly
that
the
preacher
was
here
i
like
to
ask
him
but
perhaps
he
would
like
to
talk
with
a
poor
ignorant
boy
like
me
well
continued
the
mother
i
know
and
she
placed
her
hand
upon
her
heart
that
all
god
does
is
just
right
however
dark
it
seems
and
that
satisfies
me
tom
was
impressed
by
his
mother
faith
but
soon
objected
mother
do
you
think
we
can
always
trust
our
feelings
you
said
a
little
while
ago
that
you
that
there
would
be
trouble
with
the
indians
but
nobody
expects
that
and
now
you
say
that
you
that
all
god
does
is
right
now
if
you
are
wrong
about
the
indians
and
about
father
being
in
danger
from
them
how
can
you
be
sure
that
your
feelings
are
right
about
god
tom
replied
she
i
have
a
great
many
impressions
that
come
to
nothing
but
there
are
that
do
and
i
that
god
does
right
for
i
that
he
does
and
tom
we
shall
see
about
the
indians
and
she
sighed
heavily
and
rose
and
gazed
long
and
earnestly
off
over
the
prairie
and
towards
the
woods
then
seating
herself
on
the
bedside
she
said
gently
my
son
you
have
told
me
all
your
troubles
yet
had
you
better
hold
nothing
back
from
me
the
lad
turned
away
at
this
deeply
touched
again
for
thought
he
her
feelings
are
right
about
me
perhaps
they
are
about
god
and
her
persevering
and
delicate
solicitude
pierced
his
very
soul
mother
said
he
at
length
struggling
with
emotion
i
do
want
to
grow
up
ignorant
and
useless
and
i
do
want
the
children
and
us
all
to
be
so
poor
and
despised
and
the
tears
came
again
and
the
mother
mingled
with
his
i
ca
bear
to
have
it
so
and
i
he
added
rising
in
bed
and
speaking
with
excited
energy
ah
my
poor
child
said
the
mother
i
knew
it
was
that
that
lay
on
your
mind
and
took
away
your
appetite
and
made
you
so
unhappy
and
i
have
been
praying
for
a
long
while
that
you
might
feel
so
you
did
want
me
to
be
miserable
did
you
mother
asked
tom
in
surprise
god
forbid
tom
but
i
could
wish
you
to
grow
up
contented
with
such
a
life
i
have
felt
that
you
might
do
a
great
deal
of
good
in
the
world
and
i
wished
you
to
see
it
but
mother
how
can
i
have
things
different
tom
returned
she
looking
searchingly
at
him
how
have
you
thought
to
make
them
different
the
boy
averted
his
face
again
and
made
no
reply
for
a
moment
and
then
said
softly
i
had
decided
to
go
away
and
get
learning
and
earn
my
living
and
try
to
be
somebody
and
when
did
you
think
of
starting
the
morning
answered
he
with
an
unsteady
voice
that
i
got
hurt
with
the
gun
and
were
you
going
off
without
letting
me
know
it
tom
yes
mother
but
i
expected
to
write
back
and
tell
you
all
about
it
tom
returned
the
mother
tenderly
you
asked
me
a
little
while
ago
why
it
was
that
god
let
you
get
hurt
that
morning
when
you
were
trying
to
kill
the
hens
for
the
family
while
those
bad
boys
go
uninjured
i
believe
god
ways
were
right
in
this
why
my
dear
child
you
are
better
to
me
and
more
necessary
to
me
at
present
than
many
prairie
hens
and
you
might
have
harmed
yourself
more
by
going
from
home
than
you
were
by
the
powder
you
meant
it
well
tom
but
you
reasoned
about
going
away
just
as
you
reasoned
about
dealings
with
you
a
tom
you
are
necessary
now
to
my
comfort
and
perhaps
my
life
i
am
not
over
strong
and
any
great
trouble
might
be
too
much
for
me
i
am
afraid
nights
now
but
i
feel
safer
when
you
are
here
and
you
help
me
a
great
deal
about
house
and
in
the
care
of
the
children
your
father
is
away
so
much
i
have
to
depend
on
you
and
what
if
when
you
are
away
the
cabin
should
take
fire
and
you
know
our
stove
is
none
of
the
tightest
or
if
we
should
have
trouble
with
the
savages
and
who
would
get
the
wood
up
for
us
during
the
cold
winter
that
is
coming
god
took
too
good
care
of
us
tom
to
let
you
forsake
us
that
morning
besides
tom
you
would
have
succeeded
why
not
asked
tom
faintly
you
had
decent
clothes
to
go
in
nor
any
recommendations
your
life
had
been
very
different
from
that
you
proposed
to
enter
upon
and
you
had
a
cent
of
money
to
help
you
on
your
way
the
chances
were
that
you
would
have
suffered
and
instead
of
helping
us
as
you
do
now
you
would
have
been
a
source
of
sorrow
anxiety
and
expense
to
us
is
it
not
so
tom
saw
that
his
mother
understood
the
case
but
his
heart
sank
as
his
fell
and
he
wept
anew
but
do
not
misunderstand
me
tom
as
you
did
god
dealings
with
you
what
i
say
brings
to
you
a
great
disappointment
it
seems
almost
cruel
in
me
thus
to
cut
off
your
hopes
of
being
something
better
in
the
world
tom
it
does
not
follow
because
you
were
going
too
soon
and
god
permitted
an
accident
to
stop
you
that
the
time
may
never
come
for
you
to
realize
your
hopes
so
far
as
they
are
right
you
say
you
wish
to
be
useful
you
useful
now
very
useful
be
contented
to
help
at
home
for
the
present
and
god
will
i
doubt
not
open
something
better
for
you
in
his
own
good
time
and
kissing
him
she
lay
down
upon
her
bed
for
a
short
nap
before
the
day
should
break
chapter
iv
a
brush
with
a
black
heart
hello
let
me
in
i
say
are
you
all
dead
and
a
strong
hand
shook
the
door
jones
rubbed
her
eyes
for
she
had
overslept
herself
and
as
the
children
depended
on
her
to
awaken
them
in
the
morning
they
were
sleeping
too
hastening
to
the
door
she
undid
the
fastening
and
her
husband
entered
is
that
you
joseph
she
asked
it
is
anybody
else
i
reckon
he
gruffly
answered
but
where
shall
i
put
this
taking
a
quarter
of
venison
from
his
shoulder
which
his
wife
hung
against
the
wall
on
a
wooden
peg
i
glad
you
got
back
joseph
well
you
might
be
for
you
came
near
never
seeing
me
again
i
hope
you
have
met
with
any
mishap
said
the
wife
anxiously
nothing
to
speak
of
only
a
scratch
from
the
bullet
of
one
of
them
rascally
why
you
have
been
fighting
with
the
indians
have
you
not
exactly
he
answered
i
always
treated
them
well
but
after
this
if
any
of
get
in
my
way
i
shall
pop
at
before
they
do
at
me
that
all
but
how
did
they
happen
to
shoot
at
you
asked
jones
well
said
her
husband
just
give
me
something
to
put
on
my
side
for
it
a
grain
sore
after
my
long
tramp
and
cook
us
a
venison
steak
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
and
jones
pulling
open
his
showed
an
flesh
wound
in
his
side
dear
me
joseph
you
hurt
said
the
wife
as
she
carefully
bandaged
it
putting
on
a
simple
salve
which
she
always
kept
on
hand
for
family
use
you
look
tired
and
pale
bringing
home
such
a
load
and
bleeding
all
the
way
sit
down
and
i
get
you
something
to
eat
directly
scarcely
had
he
seated
himself
when
there
was
a
cry
of
pain
from
tom
and
bub
came
tumbling
head
first
upon
the
floor
for
having
seen
his
father
he
had
scrambled
without
ceremony
across
tom
sore
face
and
receiving
a
push
from
the
latter
landed
upon
his
nose
by
this
time
the
rest
of
the
children
were
awake
and
shouting
come
home
while
bub
bellowed
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
my
nose
beeds
my
nose
beeds
o
no
it
do
replied
his
mother
soothingly
well
it
feels
it
does
he
answered
determined
to
be
pitied
this
remark
elicited
peals
of
laughter
from
his
brothers
and
sisters
which
bub
taking
as
insults
he
roared
the
louder
children
cried
jones
stop
laughing
at
bub
but
he
cut
too
comical
a
figure
for
them
to
stop
at
once
for
as
he
had
used
the
night
before
one
of
tom
old
shirts
for
a
night
dress
he
now
found
it
difficult
to
move
towards
his
father
as
each
time
he
stepped
the
garment
would
trip
his
feet
children
interposed
jones
why
do
you
hush
your
spoken
to
you
a
number
of
times
already
at
which
bub
added
with
dignity
as
he
tried
to
balance
himself
i
des
they
they
so
hard
o
hearin
your
father
said
the
mother
impressively
has
been
shot
at
by
the
indians
and
came
very
near
being
killed
and
you
ought
to
keep
more
quiet
did
they
kill
you
daddy
asked
bub
who
now
stood
at
his
knee
his
blue
eyes
wide
with
wonder
tause
if
they
did
i
stick
my
big
stick
into
their
backs
there
was
a
suppressed
tittering
at
this
for
which
the
children
felt
half
ashamed
considering
the
startling
intelligence
they
had
just
heard
mother
was
afraid
you
have
trouble
with
the
indians
observed
tom
and
she
was
so
much
worried
that
she
did
sleep
last
night
why
the
indians
have
been
doing
any
mischief
about
here
have
they
asked
his
father
no
replied
tom
and
i
told
mother
that
there
was
any
danger
but
the
venison
was
filling
the
cabin
with
its
savory
smell
and
jones
said
hurry
children
and
get
washed
and
dressed
for
breakfast
and
going
to
the
basin
which
was
in
its
place
on
the
outside
the
door
with
much
discussion
as
to
who
should
have
the
first
chance
hands
and
faces
were
treated
to
a
hasty
bath
jones
was
about
years
of
age
a
short
man
with
dark
hair
and
heavy
beard
he
was
a
man
of
much
natural
ability
and
exhibited
singular
contrasts
in
character
and
speech
the
free
and
easy
carriage
and
quaint
language
of
the
sat
easily
upon
him
and
yet
at
times
he
would
express
himself
in
words
well
chosen
and
even
elegant
he
hated
society
and
was
despised
by
the
settlers
for
his
lack
of
enterprise
and
yet
when
circumstances
drew
him
out
they
were
at
the
variety
and
accuracy
of
his
information
these
inconsistencies
made
him
a
mystery
and
he
was
looked
down
upon
and
looked
up
to
as
his
neighbors
came
in
contact
with
one
of
the
other
side
of
his
characteristics
in
all
too
that
pertained
to
the
habits
of
the
animals
and
the
appearance
of
the
country
no
one
was
so
well
posted
as
he
he
was
built
for
physical
endurance
was
cool
and
courageous
in
danger
but
could
not
confine
himself
to
regular
employment
bodily
or
mental
is
tom
coming
to
breakfast
inquired
jones
as
the
rest
of
the
children
were
greedily
helping
themselves
from
the
plate
of
meat
so
the
mother
related
how
tom
had
been
hurt
and
then
said
but
you
have
told
us
how
you
received
your
injury
well
said
jones
as
he
pushed
away
his
plate
having
satisfied
his
appetite
i
had
started
for
the
lake
hearing
that
there
was
a
good
many
wild
geese
and
other
sorts
of
game
there
and
the
prospect
was
that
we
should
make
a
pretty
big
thing
of
it
but
the
afternoon
after
we
reached
the
pond
and
was
looking
about
a
little
davis
and
i
were
crossing
a
prairie
and
had
come
in
sight
of
a
grove
and
says
i
to
him
just
go
round
on
the
other
side
of
the
thicket
and
go
in
on
this
and
if
there
any
deer
in
there
one
of
us
start
them
out
well
i
got
within
a
few
yards
of
the
trees
when
the
first
i
knew
i
heard
the
crack
of
a
rifle
and
a
bullet
came
singing
through
my
side
says
i
to
myself
a
compliments
and
making
believe
that
i
was
a
gorner
i
pitched
forward
and
lay
still
as
a
door
nail
in
the
tall
grass
i
had
lain
there
more
a
minute
when
sure
enough
a
popped
out
from
behind
a
tree
close
by
and
made
for
me
to
take
my
scalp
i
had
my
revolver
ready
and
when
he
was
within
a
few
feet
of
me
i
just
let
daylight
through
him
and
as
he
fell
not
knowing
how
many
more
of
the
scamps
might
be
about
i
dragged
myself
along
to
the
side
of
the
lake
where
i
found
davis
waiting
for
me
for
he
had
seen
the
whole
thing
and
creeping
around
to
the
other
side
under
the
banks
we
made
tracks
for
home
why
under
the
sun
the
feller
did
put
the
bullet
through
my
heart
i
ca
make
out
for
i
never
knew
one
of
to
miss
when
he
was
so
near
as
that
and
had
a
fair
aim
jones
then
knew
why
her
heart
was
so
burdened
on
his
account
at
the
very
hour
of
his
marvellous
escape
from
death
but
their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
settler
who
called
to
ask
if
they
had
seen
anything
of
a
stray
pair
of
cattle
ah
neighbor
allen
is
that
you
said
jones
going
to
speak
to
the
caller
who
sat
upon
his
horse
before
the
door
ah
jones
when
did
you
git
back
and
what
luck
rejoined
the
horseman
in
a
hearty
way
got
a
taste
of
venison
replied
jones
and
had
a
brush
with
the
injins
ah
ha
the
red
scamps
want
to
smell
powder
again
do
they
well
ready
for
them
for
one
and
i
have
seven
boys
not
an
inch
shorter
than
i
am
and
as
good
with
the
rifle
as
the
best
who
would
like
a
sight
at
the
varmints
but
if
none
of
your
folks
have
seen
any
stray
cattle
about
the
diggins
i
must
be
going
fact
is
i
reckon
been
driv
off
by
some
thievish
villain
what
sort
of
cattle
were
yours
inquired
jones
one
was
red
and
the
other
was
a
brindle
was
the
red
one
very
large
with
very
horns
that
the
ticket
said
the
man
i
saw
such
a
one
last
night
going
down
that
way
by
our
cabin
you
did
was
brindle
follerin
no
replied
she
but
some
men
were
driving
him
they
were
indians
cried
tom
excitedly
but
jones
fell
to
scraping
the
tin
pan
she
held
in
one
hand
with
a
and
drowned
his
words
so
that
they
did
not
hear
while
she
motioned
to
him
to
be
silent
the
caller
sat
thinking
a
moment
his
hair
was
but
his
face
was
youthful
and
ruddy
and
his
massive
frame
indicated
remarkable
physical
strength
he
was
a
bold
and
athletic
man
skilful
with
the
rifle
and
a
lineal
descendant
of
the
revolutionary
hero
whose
name
he
bore
and
whose
fighting
characteristics
were
reproduced
in
him
what
time
was
the
ox
driv
by
he
asked
about
twelve
i
should
think
said
she
were
the
men
afoot
yes
well
they
have
to
travel
fast
to
git
away
from
me
and
if
i
catch
but
the
remainder
of
the
sentence
was
lost
in
the
distance
for
the
old
man
had
already
touched
the
trail
of
the
stolen
ox
and
dismounting
examined
carefully
the
ground
then
fiercely
shouting
indians
drove
on
at
full
speed
when
he
had
gone
jones
turned
to
his
wife
and
asked
did
you
the
men
that
driv
the
ox
yes
why
on
earth
did
you
say
so
then
husband
said
jones
the
trouble
will
come
soon
enough
and
i
was
hoping
allen
would
never
find
out
who
took
his
cattle
if
he
shoots
one
indian
it
will
bring
hundreds
of
them
upon
the
settlements
and
we
shall
have
dreadful
times
fush
returned
the
husband
allen
is
good
for
a
dozen
indians
and
there
are
plenty
more
of
us
to
help
him
but
do
you
be
scared
the
know
us
too
well
to
risk
a
fight
they
only
prowl
around
and
steal
a
little
beef
and
shoot
at
a
fellar
unaware
from
under
kiver
that
all
they
venter
on
you
can
depend
on
that
then
he
took
down
his
rifle
cleaned
and
loaded
it
and
saying
i
guess
go
along
a
piece
perhaps
allen
come
across
the
varmints
afore
aware
with
a
quick
step
he
was
soon
hidden
from
view
the
news
of
the
accident
that
had
happened
to
tom
and
that
jones
had
been
shot
at
by
the
indians
spread
rapidly
with
many
exaggerations
for
the
inhabitants
of
a
new
country
being
mutually
dependent
feel
a
special
personal
interest
in
whatever
befalls
each
other
besides
there
are
not
such
distinctions
as
obtain
in
the
old
settled
portions
of
the
country
and
they
become
well
acquainted
with
one
another
affairs
moreover
the
doctor
as
he
went
his
rounds
gave
a
flaming
account
of
the
injury
that
his
patient
at
the
cabin
had
sustained
and
painted
in
glowing
colors
the
magical
effects
of
his
professional
services
if
he
did
not
assert
in
so
many
words
that
tom
head
was
actually
blown
from
his
body
and
that
he
replaced
it
so
that
it
was
on
better
than
before
he
gave
the
impression
that
something
as
extraordinary
had
been
achieved
by
his
medical
and
surgical
skill
and
through
the
day
quite
a
number
called
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
or
show
their
sympathy
it
proved
therefore
quite
an
occasion
for
the
jones
children
and
they
feasted
their
eyes
and
ears
to
their
hearts
content
as
for
the
mother
weary
of
the
unwonted
interruptions
and
wishing
to
commune
with
her
own
heart
she
willingly
bade
the
last
visitor
good
by
and
calling
robert
she
directed
him
to
bring
in
some
wood
and
make
a
fire
that
she
might
fry
some
cakes
for
tea
robert
proceeded
with
alacrity
to
do
this
the
other
children
helping
him
in
the
task
the
prospect
of
the
cakes
being
the
quickening
principle
robert
filled
the
grate
with
dry
wood
and
proceeding
to
light
it
the
room
was
soon
dense
with
smoke
this
however
was
no
new
experience
as
the
blackened
walls
of
the
cabin
testified
but
soon
the
smoke
had
measurably
cleared
away
and
the
sent
up
volumes
of
steam
and
jones
taking
some
meal
from
her
frugal
stock
poured
boiling
water
upon
it
and
added
some
salt
then
putting
on
the
griddle
some
deer
fat
she
put
the
dough
in
large
iron
spoonfuls
into
the
sputtering
grease
your
father
will
relish
these
said
she
to
the
children
who
stood
in
solid
ranks
around
the
stove
watching
her
with
interest
and
having
taken
off
the
last
cake
she
set
the
heaping
plate
in
the
open
oven
to
keep
warm
till
her
husband
came
i
guess
pa
coming
now
said
sarah
who
anxious
to
get
to
eating
had
looked
out
to
see
if
he
was
in
sight
no
it
is
he
either
i
do
know
who
it
is
how
nicely
dressed
he
is
at
the
latter
exclamation
the
family
urchins
rushed
in
a
body
through
the
door
upsetting
sarah
in
their
eagerness
to
see
the
wonder
a
gentlemanly
man
in
black
with
gold
spectacles
and
pleasant
countenance
approached
accustomed
to
the
specimens
of
humanity
that
do
the
hard
work
of
the
frontier
the
children
overawed
by
his
appearance
shrank
behind
cabin
and
pigsty
in
spite
of
his
kindly
invitations
to
stay
where
they
peeped
at
him
in
astonishment
jones
i
presume
said
he
bowing
as
abashed
she
answered
his
polite
rap
on
the
yes
sir
she
replied
wondering
how
he
knew
her
name
entering
without
being
asked
for
jones
was
too
confused
to
think
of
it
he
said
i
heard
that
your
son
had
met
with
an
injury
and
as
i
was
looking
up
children
for
the
sabbath
school
we
are
to
organize
next
sunday
i
thought
i
would
step
in
and
see
how
he
was
and
how
many
of
your
little
ones
could
attend
it
is
the
missionary
whispered
tom
as
his
mother
nervously
smoothed
the
the
good
minister
heard
the
remark
and
not
appearing
to
notice
the
mother
embarrassment
stepped
to
tom
side
and
in
a
way
that
made
both
mother
and
son
feel
at
ease
said
i
hope
you
are
not
seriously
hurt
my
lad
no
sir
replied
tom
grateful
for
his
thoughtful
kindness
my
face
was
burnt
pretty
badly
by
the
powder
but
it
nearly
well
now
and
the
black
is
coming
off
nicely
how
did
you
contrive
to
get
hurt
so
at
this
season
of
the
year
boys
sometimes
get
burned
with
powder
on
independence
day
i
once
met
with
such
an
accident
myself
how
did
it
happen
tom
ventured
to
inquire
for
he
loved
dearly
to
hear
a
story
it
was
when
i
was
about
fourteen
replied
the
minister
i
was
a
little
and
had
for
some
weeks
saved
up
my
pennies
to
celebrate
the
fourth
with
i
bought
me
a
half
pound
of
powder
and
a
little
iron
cannon
on
wheels
and
as
you
may
believe
anticipated
a
jolly
time
i
had
decided
the
night
before
to
commence
the
day
with
a
grand
salute
and
that
it
might
produce
the
greatest
effect
i
crept
softly
down
in
my
stocking
feet
by
my
into
the
front
hall
before
daylight
and
having
loaded
my
little
gun
to
the
muzzle
the
evening
before
i
touched
it
off
it
made
a
great
noise
i
assure
you
all
the
louder
of
course
because
it
was
in
the
house
then
slipping
on
my
shoes
i
went
into
the
streets
leaving
the
old
folks
to
go
to
sleep
again
if
they
could
my
first
use
of
the
powder
you
see
did
no
harm
to
me
unless
it
made
me
careless
when
i
got
into
the
street
i
found
crowds
of
boys
and
men
were
there
before
me
making
all
the
noise
they
could
firing
off
crackers
pistols
and
guns
and
making
the
foggy
morning
air
resound
with
the
music
of
tin
horns
and
drums
meeting
a
boy
with
a
large
i
bought
it
of
him
at
a
foolishly
high
price
and
banged
away
with
that
till
breakfast
time
at
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
city
where
i
then
lived
was
a
high
hill
called
munjoy
on
which
the
soldiers
were
to
encamp
that
day
and
after
eating
a
hurried
meal
i
went
there
scores
of
white
tents
were
pitched
occupied
by
men
who
sold
all
sorts
of
tempting
eatables
while
thousands
of
men
women
and
children
walked
about
it
was
an
exciting
scene
to
me
the
hill
indeed
was
a
glorious
spot
for
it
overlooked
the
city
on
the
one
side
with
its
thousands
of
buildings
and
shaded
streets
and
on
the
other
the
harbor
with
its
shipping
and
wharves
and
lovely
islands
while
the
ocean
stretched
away
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
i
never
saw
the
ocean
interrupted
tom
well
i
will
tell
you
what
it
resembles
you
have
looked
for
miles
and
miles
over
the
prairie
i
mean
a
prairie
that
in
gentle
swells
of
land
extends
till
the
sky
shuts
down
upon
it
o
yes
answered
tom
well
imagine
that
prairie
turned
to
water
so
deep
that
you
could
not
touch
bottom
with
the
longest
line
you
ever
saw
the
ocean
would
look
so
only
remember
that
it
is
always
in
motion
ebbing
and
flowing
and
roaring
and
dashing
against
the
land
and
the
rocks
its
waves
sometimes
running
very
high
topped
off
with
a
white
foam
o
said
tom
earnestly
if
i
could
only
once
see
it
the
minister
studied
tom
expressive
face
a
moment
and
then
said
perhaps
you
may
some
day
but
i
was
going
to
tell
you
how
i
got
hurt
i
had
exploded
all
the
powder
and
was
about
tired
of
the
pistol
for
you
know
such
things
do
satisfy
a
great
while
after
all
when
i
came
across
some
boys
who
were
making
volcanoes
volcanoes
you
know
are
burning
mountains
they
took
some
powder
wet
it
worked
it
with
their
fingers
into
miniature
hills
then
put
one
end
of
a
strip
of
in
the
top
of
each
and
lighted
the
other
end
of
the
paper
this
would
burn
slowly
down
into
the
top
of
the
that
would
take
fire
and
send
up
showers
of
sparks
for
quite
a
while
as
it
gradually
consumed
this
amusement
fascinated
me
so
buying
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
powder
i
made
a
hill
like
those
i
had
seen
and
lighted
the
as
i
saw
them
light
theirs
but
when
it
had
burnt
all
away
the
hill
did
not
burn
thinking
therefore
i
had
put
too
much
water
in
mine
i
stooped
down
and
poured
on
from
the
paper
some
dry
powder
in
an
instant
it
ignited
from
a
smouldering
spark
exploding
also
the
contents
of
the
paper
which
i
held
in
my
hand
my
face
was
dreadfully
burned
and
became
as
black
as
a
negro
so
did
mine
said
tom
but
it
is
coming
off
nicely
now
so
i
see
returned
the
minister
laughing
and
i
dare
say
you
worried
almost
as
much
about
the
as
you
did
about
the
tom
feared
it
would
never
come
off
said
the
mother
ah
that
just
the
way
i
felt
but
i
have
found
out
since
that
there
something
worse
than
a
black
face
what
that
asked
tom
a
black
heart
replied
the
minister
a
black
heart
repeated
tom
in
doubt
of
his
meaning
yes
my
lad
what
i
mean
is
a
heart
blackened
by
sin
ah
if
folks
worried
more
about
and
less
about
their
looks
how
much
more
sensible
it
would
be
then
after
a
pause
he
said
but
there
is
one
thing
for
which
we
should
be
very
grateful
and
that
is
that
as
there
are
remedies
for
us
when
we
injure
the
body
and
disfigure
it
as
we
did
our
faces
my
son
that
can
heal
the
injury
and
bring
the
skin
out
all
fresh
and
fair
so
there
is
a
great
physician
who
can
heal
the
hurt
which
sin
has
done
our
souls
and
cause
them
to
be
pure
and
white
forever
is
that
a
glorious
thought
yes
whispered
tom
weeping
yes
ejaculated
the
mother
with
deep
emotion
but
said
the
minister
how
many
of
these
little
folks
for
most
of
the
children
had
ventured
in
and
stood
listening
to
his
recital
will
come
to
sunday
school
next
sunday
and
getting
a
promise
that
as
many
of
them
would
be
there
as
possible
he
took
leave
saying
he
hoped
to
call
again
soon
the
children
hearts
were
taken
captive
by
their
clerical
visitor
and
well
it
might
be
so
for
he
was
their
true
friend
and
it
mattered
little
to
him
that
their
dwelling
was
rude
and
comfortless
their
clothing
old
and
worn
and
their
manners
uncultured
he
loved
them
for
his
master
sake
and
for
their
souls
sake
for
this
he
had
left
the
elegances
of
his
eastern
home
and
come
out
into
the
wilderness
he
was
a
true
man
and
a
true
minister
of
jesus
christ
seeking
not
a
name
wealth
luxury
the
favor
of
the
rich
and
great
but
to
bring
the
straying
lambs
and
sheep
into
the
fold
i
think
we
wo
wait
any
longer
for
your
father
said
jones
after
the
children
had
got
somewhat
over
the
excitement
caused
by
the
missionary
call
and
putting
her
hand
into
the
oven
to
take
from
thence
the
plate
of
cakes
she
looked
in
to
see
why
she
did
not
find
them
exclaiming
why
where
are
the
cakes
i
certainly
set
them
in
here
who
has
taken
them
away
the
children
gazed
at
each
other
in
consternation
i
bet
it
some
of
bub
doings
said
eliza
and
noticing
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
not
in
the
room
they
hastened
out
to
find
him
bub
bub
called
the
mother
bub
bub
echoed
the
children
as
they
searched
the
field
over
and
looked
into
every
nook
and
corner
that
they
could
think
of
but
there
was
no
answer
and
not
a
trace
of
him
was
to
be
found
until
at
last
charley
called
out
here
his
stick
he
can
not
be
far
off
then
said
his
mother
although
she
began
to
grow
uneasy
about
him
no
said
robert
for
he
rides
that
stick
most
all
the
time
then
he
suddenly
added
ah
you
little
rascal
i
see
you
then
turning
to
the
rest
he
whispered
just
look
here
but
do
make
any
noise
and
jones
and
the
children
gathering
softly
around
the
pen
peeping
in
saw
bub
comfortably
seated
by
the
fawn
the
cakes
in
his
lap
eating
them
and
feeding
the
gentle
creature
bub
had
teased
the
fawn
the
most
and
bub
was
the
first
to
tame
it
illustration
bub

chapter
brother
smith
and
quarter
stakes
good
morning
jones
i
suppose
we
may
call
this
indian
summer
may
we
not
and
the
missionary
for
it
was
he
shook
hands
with
the
hunter
scarcely
time
for
it
yet
replied
the
latter
but
this
is
fine
weather
though
shall
you
be
busy
i
wish
to
find
a
good
quarter
section
of
land
on
which
to
put
up
a
house
i
have
been
thinking
that
as
i
have
never
and
have
therefore
a
right
to
do
so
i
may
as
well
do
it
the
hunter
laughed
scornfully
and
said
good
many
folks
about
here
more
than
once
but
that
is
illegal
replied
the
minister
they
do
stand
about
that
but
they
are
obliged
to
take
oath
at
the
land
office
that
they
have
never
availed
themselves
of
the
privilege
and
they
take
it
but
they
perjure
themselves
in
doing
so
yes
well
said
the
clergyman
with
a
sigh
i
ca
understand
how
a
person
can
break
the
laws
and
take
a
false
oath
for
the
sake
of
a
little
land
nor
can
i
replied
the
hunter
almost
fiercely
and
i
makes
no
pretensions
to
either
i
once
and
afterwards
sold
out
and
i
hev
moved
about
considerable
sence
but
i
have
never
cheated
government
out
of
a
cent
yet
nor
anybody
as
to
that
i
own
nothing
here
this
is
government
land
that
my
cabin
sets
on
and
if
it
was
put
up
for
sale
by
the
proper
authorities
i
could
say
a
word
if
it
was
sold
improvements
and
all
i
have
to
take
my
risk
and
i
contented
to
rather
than
own
the
biggest
farm
out
doors
and
get
it
by
lying
under
oath
no
they
calls
joseph
jones
a
worthless
dog
and
do
say
he
is
but
let
me
tell
you
neighbor
that
i
have
it
on
my
conscience
that
i
went
into
the
land
office
and
lifted
up
my
right
hand
solumly
promising
to
speak
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
and
then
when
i
knows
that
i
have
once
or
maybe
a
number
of
times
swear
that
i
never
hev
as
some
of
your
praying
folks
has
do
i
understand
you
to
say
jones
that
professing
christians
living
about
here
have
done
this
that
what
i
say
replied
the
hunter
and
i
have
as
much
respect
for
sich
whining
hypercrites
as
i
have
for
a
hissing
adder
that
why
i
never
took
much
to
meetin
i
suppose
what
i
gits
i
gits
honest
do
i
pet
and
he
caressed
his
rifle
as
if
it
were
a
living
thing
and
understood
what
he
said
i
brings
home
what
the
good
lord
sends
inter
the
woods
an
over
the
prairies
fur
me
cattle
upon
a
thousand
hills
are
his
that
scripter
i
believe
and
it
means
i
take
it
that
the
deer
and
the
elk
and
the
bear
and
the
geese
and
the
hens
belong
to
nobody
ken
say
owns
them
all
and
keep
them
for
his
own
use
and
when
billy
here
patting
his
gun
brings
down
a
fat
buck
we
feel
about
it
we
bill
is
like
standing
behind
the
counter
with
a
smerk
on
yer
face
as
yer
cheat
in
weight
an
measure
or
sell
sanded
sugar
for
the
genuine
many
an
many
the
time
i
known
this
done
by
them
that
lives
in
fine
houses
and
wears
fine
clothes
an
goes
to
church
an
if
they
passed
joseph
jones
would
deign
to
speak
to
the
old
hunter
not
that
i
care
about
that
i
do
deign
to
speak
to
them
and
if
heaven
is
for
i
had
just
as
lieves
stay
a
while
outside
for
they
an
i
could
never
git
along
together
here
and
we
could
be
expected
to
there
but
did
you
want
anything
perticular
of
me
i
was
told
said
the
missionary
that
none
of
the
settlers
understood
so
well
about
the
land
and
where
to
find
the
section
and
quarter
section
stakes
as
you
and
i
thought
if
it
would
be
taking
too
much
of
your
time
that
perhaps
you
would
show
me
around
a
little
nothin
would
suit
my
feelings
better
said
the
hunter
was
there
any
perticular
direction
you
wish
to
go
to
brother
smith
tells
me
that
here
is
a
fine
quarter
section
still
unclaimed
and
the
clergyman
took
from
his
a
map
of
the
vicinity
purporting
to
show
what
was
taken
up
and
what
was
not
did
he
give
you
asked
the
hunter
as
he
ran
his
eye
over
the
paper
yes
as
looking
up
land
is
new
to
me
i
was
thankful
to
get
some
sort
of
a
guide
replied
the
missionary
i
do
see
much
to
be
thankful
for
on
that
drawin
why
is
that
quarter
section
free
inquired
the
minister
perplexed
yes
an
we
go
an
see
it
but
are
yer
goin
afoot
the
missionary
replied
affirmatively
you
never
stand
it
in
the
world
to
hunt
up
land
in
that
way
too
much
ground
to
go
over
wife
he
added
putting
his
head
in
at
the
door
you
jist
entertain
the
minister
while
i
see
if
i
ken
scare
up
a
team
fur
him
jones
strode
off
as
if
he
had
a
congenial
errand
to
do
and
striking
a
bee
line
across
the
prairie
over
a
river
through
a
grove
halted
before
a
cosy
cottage
that
would
remind
one
of
new
england
the
acres
and
acres
of
tilled
land
stretched
away
from
the
dwelling
enclosed
in
the
most
substantial
manner
and
sleek
cattle
that
fed
in
the
rich
pasture
bespoke
competency
and
enterprise
he
stopped
not
to
knock
at
the
door
but
entering
asked
of
a
lady
who
sat
sewing
is
yer
husband
about
mrs
lincoln
yes
he
in
the
other
room
i
speak
to
him
and
in
a
moment
the
robust
form
of
the
owner
of
the
farm
appeared
how
are
you
jones
he
said
in
an
offhand
way
o
i
nicely
i
called
on
an
errand
fur
yer
minister
that
invited
to
settle
among
us
he
wants
a
spot
for
a
cabin
like
the
rest
of
us
i
suppose
and
smith
has
told
him
to
look
at
the
quarter
section
way
over
there
a
mile
and
a
half
beyond
clark
you
know
the
place
i
jist
want
to
git
your
team
and
take
him
over
in
a
good
christian
way
and
not
let
him
travel
his
legs
off
so
that
he
preach
to
us
sinners
next
sunday
lincoln
had
been
foremost
in
urging
the
missionary
to
cast
in
his
lot
with
them
and
no
one
had
made
more
promises
of
material
aid
than
he
he
was
sincere
in
this
and
was
really
a
generous
man
but
exceedingly
careless
he
had
been
told
that
the
minister
was
going
to
look
up
a
claim
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
until
now
that
the
preacher
had
no
other
conveyance
than
his
feet
and
that
to
walk
over
the
prairies
would
be
a
toilsome
and
task
slapping
his
caller
on
the
shoulder
he
said
glad
to
see
you
interested
jones
and
to
encourage
you
i
harness
right
up
and
you
may
take
the
span
the
steeds
were
soon
in
the
buggy
and
the
hunter
having
taken
the
preacher
aboard
was
in
good
time
pointing
out
to
him
the
boundaries
of
the
claim
it
was
a
lovely
spot
like
many
such
in
prairiedom
and
the
hunter
took
care
that
it
should
be
seen
to
advantage
on
a
gentle
swell
of
ground
was
a
small
gem
of
a
grove
commanding
a
view
of
the
rest
of
the
section
the
fall
flowers
and
nodded
gayly
in
the
tall
grass
a
natural
spring
bursting
from
the
hillock
wound
its
way
along
till
lost
in
the
distance
the
sun
was
pouring
down
its
rays
from
a
sky
and
soft
how
could
the
preacher
with
his
pure
tastes
and
cultivated
love
of
the
beautiful
help
being
delighted
with
the
scene
this
is
delightful
he
exclaimed
i
build
my
cottage
right
here
by
the
side
of
this
spring
and
my
tilled
land
will
always
be
in
view
the
hunter
had
anticipated
his
decision
and
dryly
observed
it
would
be
no
sich
place
as
yer
ought
to
hev
why
not
asked
the
minister
smiling
do
you
reckon
on
keeping
a
horse
asked
the
other
no
i
could
afford
that
how
then
are
you
goin
to
git
to
yer
appintments
an
to
visit
the
sick
an
the
dyin
from
this
pint
and
you
never
farm
it
much
the
land
looks
nice
and
slick
as
a
gentleman
lawn
this
is
one
of
the
lord
lawns
neighbor
but
was
made
for
you
to
live
on
you
expect
to
hev
no
evenin
meetin
you
ca
hev
them
out
here
where
there
no
live
critter
but
the
prairie
hins
and
maybe
in
the
winter
a
stray
wolf
or
two
you
a
man
and
necessary
for
you
to
be
right
among
folks
and
not
livin
off
one
side
like
as
if
you
wanted
to
keep
out
the
way
of
company
this
rugged
way
of
putting
things
was
quite
effective
and
the
missionary
said
you
are
right
but
what
can
i
do
by
this
chart
i
find
that
there
is
little
vacant
land
about
here
and
i
am
unable
to
purchase
an
improved
farm
at
the
prices
at
which
they
are
held
you
do
mean
to
settle
down
on
do
ye
that
is
out
of
the
question
well
joseph
jones
is
of
much
account
but
if
he
do
show
you
a
bit
of
land
that
been
left
for
jist
sich
as
you
then
i
lie
like
that
lying
chart
he
said
angrily
and
motioning
the
preacher
to
resume
his
seat
in
the
buggy
the
hunter
drove
back
for
some
distance
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
come
then
striking
a
to
the
right
suddenly
emerged
from
a
piece
of
woods
near
a
river
on
the
farther
bank
of
which
was
a
and
in
the
stream
were
men
at
work
strengthening
a
dam
there
said
the
hunter
is
the
centre
of
things
so
fur
as
this
vicinity
is
concerned
that
the
store
as
he
pointed
across
the
river
to
a
small
building
and
a
hotel
is
going
up
just
opposite
and
the
land
sharks
and
speculators
that
going
to
settle
here
will
want
jist
sich
as
you
right
among
to
stir
up
their
consciences
and
jog
their
pure
minds
by
way
of
remembrance
as
the
book
says
an
not
way
off
there
pointing
contemptuously
over
his
shoulder
but
brother
smith
informs
me
that
all
the
land
near
to
the
town
is
taken
up
said
the
missionary
smith
who
he
i
know
smith
and
if
you
kin
fellowship
him
i
ca
an
when
you
come
to
sift
folks
down
as
i
foresee
sich
as
you
will
you
wo
brother
him
much
unless
he
repints
an
i
do
say
he
wo
now
let
me
introduce
you
to
your
future
home
ef
you
settles
in
these
parts
there
is
the
town
where
we
now
are
and
he
placed
the
tip
of
his
little
finger
on
the
place
as
represented
on
the
map
now
coming
down
square
on
to
the
is
this
lot
lays
beautiful
to
the
town
the
main
street
running
right
up
to
it
and
through
that
street
continued
he
impressively
must
go
all
the
travel
to
the
important
places
beyond
and
by
and
by
when
the
immigration
gets
strong
enough
the
owner
of
that
piece
of
land
will
hev
corner
lots
and
sich
to
sell
let
me
show
jist
how
it
lays
and
crossing
the
bridge
and
passing
up
the
projected
street
he
stopped
the
horses
on
a
gentle
rise
of
ground
forming
the
nearest
point
in
the
eighty
acres
there
he
continued
referring
to
the
map
again
you
see
the
lot
runs
lengthwise
from
the
town
across
it
runs
a
tributary
of
the
river
just
down
there
where
you
see
the
plum
and
trees
and
beyond
that
are
ten
acres
of
the
richest
and
river
bottom
that
the
sun
ever
shone
on
all
fenced
then
follers
thirty
acres
of
young
and
valuable
timber
land
here
your
building
spot
right
here
where
we
stand
in
sight
of
everybody
and
all
the
travel
handy
to
the
store
and
and
and
sich
and
handy
to
meetin
and
the
ten
acres
of
alluvial
rich
as
the
richest
and
finely
pulverized
as
powder
you
ken
plough
it
or
hoe
it
jist
as
easy
as
you
ken
turn
your
hand
over
will
give
you
all
the
sarce
you
want
and
something
to
sell
and
there
wood
enough
down
over
the
place
to
keep
yer
fires
a
going
and
when
you
want
to
jist
sell
some
of
yer
standing
timber
there
to
help
pay
for
the
whole
at
government
price
but
replied
the
missionary
as
the
squatter
finished
his
graphic
description
i
see
by
this
chart
that
this
is
taken
up
for
he
had
meanwhile
been
examining
it
well
said
the
hunter
whose
name
writ
down
as
the
owner
of
this
land
henry
simonds
said
the
minister
reading
from
the
paper
and
do
you
know
who
simonds
may
be
asked
the
hunter
a
young
chap
jist
turned
nineteen
and
of
course
not
old
to
according
to
law
and
who
has
lived
on
this
claim
a
day
in
his
life
there
is
a
sign
of
a
shanty
on
the
place
and
the
law
requires
that
every
man
must
show
of
a
house
to
prove
that
he
is
an
actual
settler
that
name
a
blind
this
land
jines
smith
and
he
been
carrying
on
the
lot
over
the
river
rent
free
and
it
comes
very
handy
for
him
to
come
in
on
this
piece
and
get
his
it
government
property
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
put
you
up
a
cabin
and
go
ahead
and
if
smith
kicks
up
a
fuss
jist
send
him
to
me
this
revelation
of
duplicity
on
the
part
of
smith
took
the
minister
by
surprise
it
was
evident
that
the
location
would
be
as
advantageous
for
him
as
his
guide
had
represented
it
was
defrauding
the
government
for
smith
to
hold
it
as
he
did
and
should
he
in
a
legal
way
take
possession
no
one
could
accuse
him
of
wrong
but
he
had
not
come
out
on
the
frontier
to
promote
his
worldly
interests
and
he
said
to
the
hunter
what
you
say
is
all
right
i
have
no
doubt
jones
but
it
is
not
land
that
i
want
so
much
as
to
do
good
among
this
people
and
i
should
not
wish
to
do
anything
that
would
cause
ill
feeling
just
as
i
expected
said
the
squatter
with
a
disappointed
air
and
i
rather
think
you
belong
to
the
kingdom
that
is
not
of
this
world
but
you
are
stopping
at
edmunds
are
you
well
it
only
a
short
piece
to
his
cabin
and
i
must
take
the
team
back
but
after
thinking
a
moment
if
you
take
the
dam
on
your
way
you
find
palmer
there
he
a
christian
if
there
is
one
in
these
parts
and
you
can
depend
on
him
and
if
you
choose
to
talk
with
him
a
bit
about
this
lot
there
wo
be
any
harm
done
the
minister
thanked
the
squatter
for
his
services
the
latter
saying
as
he
drove
off
call
on
me
agin
if
you
want
anything
in
my
line
as
the
missionary
passed
towards
the
dam
he
saw
the
surveyors
at
work
dividing
the
town
site
into
lots
and
he
paused
to
notice
again
the
location
the
underbrush
had
been
carefully
removed
and
the
cleared
space
bounded
on
one
hand
by
the
river
and
on
the
other
by
the
forest
while
farther
away
from
each
side
stretched
the
smooth
prairie
looked
as
if
nature
had
intended
it
as
a
business
centre
how
do
you
like
our
town
plot
said
a
voice
at
his
side
it
is
charming
exclaimed
the
preacher
and
turning
he
saw
palmer
he
was
a
man
in
shirt
sleeves
and
blue
overalls
with
an
old
black
silk
hat
on
which
from
its
bent
appearance
gave
one
the
idea
that
it
had
on
occasions
been
used
for
a
seat
as
well
as
a
covering
the
keen
blue
eyes
under
it
and
the
general
contour
of
the
face
ending
in
a
chin
revealed
a
frugal
character
yet
honest
sincere
and
unselfish
he
was
indeed
what
he
struck
the
observer
as
being
a
prudent
counsellor
a
true
friend
a
helper
in
every
good
word
and
work
no
man
in
the
settlement
was
more
respected
than
he
a
respect
not
based
on
his
personal
appearance
it
was
clear
for
he
had
a
perfect
contempt
for
the
ostentations
of
dress
and
equipage
but
due
to
his
straightforward
and
consistent
deportment
he
was
about
forty
and
unmarried
and
on
account
of
his
amiable
thrifty
and
christianly
qualities
was
said
to
be
the
victim
of
incessant
by
managing
mammas
and
marriageable
daughters
and
of
no
little
raillery
on
the
part
of
the
men
which
he
bore
with
great
good
nature
safely
escaping
from
each
matrimonial
snare
and
returning
joke
for
joke
been
looking
up
land
asked
the
bachelor
the
missionary
related
the
day
doings
and
what
the
squatter
had
said
about
smith
and
the
eighty
acres
jones
has
stated
the
facts
in
the
case
said
palmer
and
advised
well
but
it
wo
do
for
you
to
have
any
falling
out
with
smith
if
you
will
leave
the
matter
with
me
i
guess
i
can
manage
it
so
that
you
shall
have
the
eighty
acres
and
there
be
no
bad
feelings
we
had
better
pay
smith
something
than
to
have
a
quarrel
but
is
smith
a
member
of
a
church
asked
the
missionary
we
do
know
who
is
who
yet
answered
the
other
but
should
we
ever
form
a
church
here
of
course
he
have
to
show
a
certificate
of
membership
in
order
to
join
and
i
rather
think
he
never
be
able
to
do
that
do
him
all
the
good
you
can
but
do
trust
him
overmuch
chapter
vi
jones
the
gray
wolf
was
it
so
different
east
mother
asked
tom
one
day
where
you
came
from
from
what
it
is
here
different
in
what
respects
she
inquired
o
he
answered
hesitatingly
i
mean
were
folks
as
poor
and
ignorant
as
as
as
we
are
you
were
going
to
say
said
she
placidly
finishing
his
sentence
for
him
i
do
think
that
you
and
father
are
he
replied
looking
confused
but
i
understand
what
you
mean
tom
no
where
your
father
and
i
were
born
and
where
we
were
married
the
country
was
thickly
settled
all
the
children
went
to
school
and
there
were
no
such
cabins
as
the
one
we
live
in
but
nice
framed
houses
of
wood
stone
or
brick
were
there
no
poor
people
there
yes
as
many
as
there
are
here
a
great
many
in
the
large
cities
and
they
found
it
very
hard
getting
along
were
yours
and
father
folks
very
poor
no
they
were
in
comfortable
circumstances
then
why
mother
did
you
come
west
and
why
do
we
live
as
we
do
now
as
she
did
not
at
once
reply
the
lad
busy
once
more
with
his
own
thoughts
forgot
that
he
had
asked
the
question
he
had
often
revolved
the
matter
in
his
own
mind
but
had
never
before
ventured
to
speak
of
it
his
mother
conversation
with
him
after
his
injury
by
the
gun
had
shown
him
the
folly
of
his
plan
of
leaving
home
clandestinely
but
dissatisfaction
with
his
lot
grew
with
his
growth
and
strengthened
with
his
strength
it
was
a
great
mystery
to
him
how
his
mother
could
consent
to
live
so
for
so
many
years
he
would
look
at
the
black
and
crazy
loggery
with
its
clay
chinking
that
was
ever
more
cracking
and
crumbling
and
falling
to
the
floor
leaving
holes
between
the
logs
through
which
the
wind
and
rain
entered
and
the
one
rickety
chair
and
the
rude
benches
and
boxes
for
sitting
accommodations
and
the
bedsteads
composed
of
rough
oaken
slabs
spiked
at
the
head
and
side
to
the
walls
and
a
rough
post
at
the
unsupported
corner
and
the
cracked
and
rusted
stove
and
leaky
funnel
and
then
he
would
look
at
his
mother
who
despite
her
coarse
and
dingy
dress
seemed
so
superior
to
her
condition
and
the
more
he
realized
the
contrast
the
more
he
marvelled
when
he
was
younger
he
had
noticed
this
incongruity
between
his
gentle
mother
and
her
wretched
surroundings
and
now
he
sometimes
wished
he
could
be
insensible
to
it
it
made
him
so
unhappy
how
restless
he
became
how
like
a
caged
eaglet
as
he
pondered
the
subject
by
night
and
by
day
none
knew
save
the
watchful
friend
who
moved
so
gently
about
the
cabin
and
kept
so
uncomplainingly
at
her
tasks
and
his
father
seemed
to
him
in
his
way
as
much
of
a
mystery
as
his
mother
was
he
contented
with
the
roving
life
he
led
and
did
he
never
realize
the
deprivations
of
his
wife
and
children
did
father
and
mother
ever
know
brighter
days
and
were
they
never
to
see
them
again
and
was
it
duty
for
him
to
keep
on
in
the
same
way
sacrificing
every
rising
aspiration
and
pure
taste
and
getting
nothing
in
return
but
poor
food
and
clothing
a
comfortless
home
and
a
mind
undeveloped
and
unfurnished
seated
on
the
end
of
a
box
shelling
corn
by
drawing
the
ears
against
the
back
of
a
broken
scythe
he
had
been
working
and
thinking
through
the
evening
while
the
children
slept
with
no
one
to
notice
his
labor
but
his
mother
i
will
not
endure
it
he
mentally
exclaimed
and
by
way
of
emphasis
he
drew
the
ear
of
corn
he
held
against
the
edge
of
the
scythe
with
unusual
force
at
the
same
instant
springing
to
his
feet
with
a
cry
of
pain
and
a
finger
in
his
mouth
upsetting
his
seat
and
sending
the
contents
of
the
box
rolling
across
the
floor
and
into
the
gaping
cracks
o
i
scraped
my
finger
awfully
he
said
with
grimaces
that
added
nothing
to
his
personal
attractions
why
how
did
you
do
it
my
son
asked
the
mother
although
she
knew
very
well
why
you
see
i
was
thinking
about
something
and
pulled
my
finger
instead
of
the
cob
against
the
edge
jones
laid
back
the
strip
of
bleeding
flesh
into
the
place
from
which
it
had
thus
unceremoniously
been
torn
and
from
which
it
hung
by
a
bit
of
skin
and
carefully
bound
up
the
wound
then
sweeping
the
scattered
kernels
into
a
heap
and
restoring
them
to
the
box
she
seated
herself
in
a
little
dislocated
chair
and
said
there
do
shell
any
more
now
tom
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
you
asked
why
we
came
west
the
time
has
come
when
you
had
better
know
something
of
our
history
it
may
help
you
decide
your
course
of
action
your
father
and
i
were
born
in
connecticut
in
the
same
town
we
attended
school
together
in
our
early
childhood
and
often
played
together
both
of
our
families
were
respectable
your
father
quite
so
although
not
so
well
off
as
to
property
as
mine
he
was
a
bright
promising
boy
quick
to
learn
and
conscientious
i
never
knew
him
guilty
of
any
of
the
petty
meannesses
too
common
among
school
children
he
was
sensitive
to
a
fault
but
had
high
notions
of
honor
and
despised
falsehood
and
deception
in
any
form
when
i
was
seventeen
i
became
secretly
engaged
to
him
my
parents
did
not
suspect
this
nor
did
any
of
the
household
except
a
younger
sister
to
whom
i
confided
my
secret
i
now
think
it
would
have
been
better
for
all
concerned
had
i
from
the
first
been
open
in
the
matter
and
frankly
stated
to
my
mother
what
my
preference
was
but
i
knew
that
he
was
not
their
choice
for
me
they
were
ambitious
to
have
me
marry
brilliantly
as
the
phrase
went
that
is
wealthily
and
in
style
and
he
was
young
and
had
his
fortune
to
carve
out
pretty
much
for
himself
he
knew
what
their
hopes
were
concerning
me
matrimonially
and
that
i
might
be
perfectly
free
to
break
the
engagement
should
i
repent
of
it
rarely
saw
me
nor
did
any
correspondence
pass
between
us
my
regard
for
him
did
not
lessen
on
this
account
for
i
understood
his
motives
when
he
was
of
age
his
father
died
leaving
him
a
thousand
dollars
as
his
portion
with
this
he
went
into
business
with
good
prospects
in
a
neighboring
city
i
shall
never
forget
how
earnestly
he
spoke
one
evening
as
we
parted
after
a
brief
interview
said
he
will
be
rich
i
set
my
mind
on
that
and
then
your
father
wo
be
ashamed
to
own
me
as
a
and
i
shall
come
and
claim
you
it
seemed
noble
and
heroic
for
him
to
speak
thus
but
my
heart
smote
me
with
foreboding
and
i
answered
what
if
you
do
not
succeed
succeed
he
replied
impetuously
a
man
he
can
do
ah
how
foolish
and
sinful
it
is
to
worship
money
and
show
as
my
parents
did
how
much
suffering
it
has
caused
me
and
how
equally
unwise
and
presumptuous
it
was
for
a
young
man
stung
by
the
pride
of
others
to
make
that
the
rule
of
his
life
and
go
forth
in
his
own
strength
to
build
up
a
fortune
so
that
he
might
me
of
my
parents
as
an
equal
and
thus
gratify
his
own
pride
i
see
it
now
but
not
clearly
then
joseph
for
a
time
was
prosperous
everything
he
turned
his
hand
to
was
remunerative
and
when
we
met
his
manner
was
confident
and
hopeful
the
old
gentleman
look
down
upon
me
now
if
he
chooses
he
would
say
wo
always
do
it
he
had
been
a
year
in
business
when
a
partnership
was
proposed
to
him
by
a
man
of
education
and
gentlemanly
appearance
joseph
spoke
to
me
about
it
and
i
said
are
doing
well
enough
now
why
not
be
contented
to
go
alone
i
have
often
heard
that
partnerships
are
poor
ships
to
sail
in
said
he
something
in
his
appearance
that
i
do
not
quite
like
and
i
think
i
shall
not
take
him
in
but
as
the
man
came
with
the
highest
testimonials
as
to
his
character
ability
and
influence
with
the
hope
of
greatly
enlarging
his
business
a
copartnership
was
entered
into
jacques
the
partner
was
joseph
senior
in
age
a
stout
robust
man
with
a
high
forehead
light
hair
always
carried
a
cane
was
jovial
and
in
the
extreme
fond
of
telling
a
good
story
but
sharp
in
trade
i
met
him
on
one
occasion
and
there
was
something
in
the
turn
of
his
eye
a
restless
jerking
selfish
expression
that
made
me
shrink
from
him
joseph
was
proud
of
his
acquisition
and
remembering
my
caution
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
him
i
well
remember
the
reply
that
leaped
to
my
lips
you
say
that
he
was
religious
professes
to
be
said
he
fear
that
it
is
only
a
cloak
to
his
real
character
if
he
is
a
christian
i
do
not
know
what
grace
has
done
for
him
but
if
i
do
not
misread
his
face
he
is
constitutionally
dishonest
but
every
thing
went
on
smoothly
and
joseph
would
say
to
me
when
we
met
partner
loves
scandal
a
little
too
well
is
apt
to
talk
against
others
but
one
thing
i
sure
of
he
honest
one
morning
some
months
after
this
conversation
i
chanced
to
meet
joseph
as
he
was
going
to
the
office
he
looked
pale
and
careworn
said
he
have
had
the
most
singular
exercise
of
mind
some
folks
are
troubled
with
sleeplessness
but
i
never
was
until
last
night
i
went
to
bed
feeling
as
well
as
usual
but
could
not
sleep
i
was
not
unusually
tired
had
taken
a
light
supper
and
saw
no
reason
why
i
should
be
so
wakeful
i
turned
and
tossed
in
bed
and
shut
my
eyes
but
all
in
vain
i
even
laid
my
finger
on
my
wrist
that
the
counting
of
my
pulse
might
by
the
monotony
induce
slumber
when
suddenly
before
my
mind
eye
stood
my
partner
it
seemed
as
real
as
life
and
with
the
appearance
came
little
remarks
of
his
little
acts
and
words
which
as
they
ranged
themselves
along
like
the
links
in
a
chain
revealed
him
to
me
against
my
will
as
a
deceiver
and
a
dishonest
man
he
was
much
excited
and
hurried
to
town
jacques
as
i
afterwards
learned
was
there
before
him
and
met
him
with
his
bland
smile
and
compliments
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
scarcely
an
hour
had
passed
before
he
had
charmed
away
every
shadow
of
suspicion
matters
now
went
on
as
before
for
a
few
weeks
when
joseph
had
another
sleepless
night
and
a
more
convincing
unfolding
of
his
partner
real
character
and
the
next
night
after
the
office
had
been
closed
he
spent
in
examining
the
books
of
the
concern
and
detected
a
number
of
fraudulent
entries
in
the
handwriting
of
his
partner
for
according
to
agreement
the
latter
kept
the
accounts
further
revelations
showed
that
he
had
been
gradually
abstracting
the
stock
as
soon
as
jacques
saw
that
he
was
being
found
out
his
gentleness
and
politeness
were
all
gone
and
he
raged
like
a
beast
of
prey
joseph
attached
his
furniture
at
his
dwelling
but
found
it
had
all
been
made
over
to
his
son
a
young
lawyer
in
the
city
meanwhile
the
dishonest
man
had
fled
with
his
gains
leaving
the
business
in
a
frightfully
complicated
state
the
result
was
as
is
often
the
case
when
a
man
begins
to
go
down
in
his
affairs
although
he
may
be
ever
so
deserving
and
innocent
there
are
enough
to
give
him
a
push
it
was
so
with
him
in
vain
did
joseph
by
his
books
show
that
he
was
doing
well
up
to
the
cruel
embezzlements
and
that
if
he
was
dealt
leniently
with
he
could
recover
his
standing
and
go
on
as
prosperously
as
before
his
creditors
one
after
another
ferociously
pounced
upon
him
he
got
through
one
trouble
only
to
meet
another
until
utter
failure
came
the
effect
on
joseph
was
lamentable
in
the
extreme
he
sat
by
his
fire
at
home
day
after
day
for
weeks
with
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
in
utter
despair
had
some
kind
friend
stepped
forward
and
started
him
anew
what
a
deed
of
mercy
it
would
have
been
but
the
men
whom
he
accommodated
with
money
when
prosperous
turned
their
backs
upon
him
now
recovering
somewhat
from
the
shock
he
sought
again
and
again
for
employment
but
his
and
relentless
creditors
would
factorize
his
earnings
and
thus
oblige
him
to
leave
factorize
asked
tom
interrupting
her
what
is
that
why
said
the
mother
if
a
man
owes
another
the
creditor
attaches
his
wages
and
when
the
man
presents
his
bill
to
his
employer
he
finds
that
he
can
not
pay
him
anything
in
vain
he
went
to
distant
places
to
earn
a
subsistence
shrewd
lawyers
were
put
upon
his
track
he
was
ferretted
out
until
discouraged
he
came
to
me
one
day
and
said
the
hounds
are
after
me
from
morning
till
night
they
dog
my
steps
wherever
i
go
and
give
me
no
chance
to
retrieve
my
fortunes
i
am
going
to
the
west
and
it
is
right
to
hold
you
to
your
engagement
any
longer
for
i
can
never
on
my
part
fulfil
it
the
odds
are
against
me
here
and
what
is
worse
i
lost
my
courage
and
hope
i
have
come
to
bid
you
good
by
you
do
not
care
for
me
any
longer
i
said
so
struggled
hard
and
have
merited
a
better
result
it
is
your
fault
that
you
have
failed
god
forbid
that
i
should
break
my
promise
if
you
must
go
west
you
are
not
going
alone
i
shall
go
with
you
and
shall
this
very
night
tell
my
parents
all
about
my
engagement
and
get
their
consent
to
our
marriage
he
shook
his
head
but
feeling
that
it
had
been
cowardly
in
me
not
to
have
mentioned
the
subject
before
whatever
the
result
might
have
been
in
a
few
words
i
frankly
and
with
a
composure
that
surprised
myself
told
them
the
whole
story
my
father
was
a
imperious
man
and
my
mother
lived
only
for
this
world
the
result
you
can
easily
imagine
but
i
felt
that
my
duty
was
plain
and
we
were
quietly
married
having
a
little
money
of
my
own
joining
it
with
what
your
father
had
by
him
we
started
towards
the
setting
sun
but
what
was
that
said
jones
stopping
in
her
recital
as
a
strange
sound
fell
upon
her
ear
it
was
a
long
fiendish
yell
swelling
upon
the
still
night
air
over
the
unbroken
solitudes
of
the
prairie
it
was
most
appalling
tom
and
his
mother
hastened
to
the
window
they
saw
a
noble
buck
his
antlers
held
aloft
flying
with
his
utmost
speed
pursued
by
two
objects
that
gained
rapidly
on
him
it
the
gray
wolf
said
tom
chasing
a
deer
how
i
wish
i
had
a
rifle
i
could
bring
one
of
them
down
easy
as
not
as
they
dashed
by
with
short
quick
yells
following
their
prey
into
the
woods
that
skirted
the
river
i
hope
the
poor
creature
will
escape
said
jones
with
a
sigh
and
she
resumed
her
narrative
i
was
not
long
in
seeing
on
our
journey
out
that
a
dreadful
change
had
been
wrought
in
your
father
by
his
business
troubles
it
had
given
him
an
unconquerable
disgust
of
society
which
he
has
not
yet
outgrown
making
him
uneasy
and
restless
wherever
he
has
been
and
this
tom
is
the
secret
of
his
wandering
life
and
this
is
why
i
never
feel
that
i
can
complain
at
any
of
the
changes
in
our
hard
unsettled
career
as
a
family
tom
who
had
listened
absorbed
to
this
before
unread
chapter
in
the
family
history
was
deeply
moved
and
while
the
tears
filled
his
eyes
asked
in
tremulous
tones
do
you
think
father
ever
get
over
it
mother
tom
replied
she
your
father
has
a
true
heart
and
a
good
mind
and
i
believe
that
in
some
way
good
will
yet
come
out
of
this
trial
he
taken
a
great
liking
to
the
missionary
and
payson
seems
to
understand
him
better
than
most
and
i
am
praying
that
the
acquaintance
may
lead
to
something
brighter
for
him
and
tom
she
added
i
have
told
you
this
that
you
may
see
a
new
reason
for
not
being
in
haste
to
leave
your
father
and
mother
there
is
one
passage
in
the
bible
i
often
think
of
which
directs
us
to
both
hope
and
quietly
wait
for
the
salvation
of
god
your
father
mistake
when
he
went
into
business
was
that
he
was
in
too
great
haste
to
accomplish
his
own
will
this
is
apt
to
be
the
error
of
the
young
they
are
sanguine
of
success
and
they
rush
into
the
battle
of
life
without
waiting
to
put
on
the
armor
of
faith
what
the
young
want
in
setting
out
tom
is
a
guide
and
a
helper
who
can
not
err
and
will
not
forsake
them
an
old
man
in
our
town
used
to
say
try
to
kick
open
the
door
of
providence
i
want
you
tom
to
wait
patiently
till
providence
opens
the
door
for
you
then
you
need
not
be
afraid
to
go
forward
chapter
vii
a
sabbath
on
the
prairie
from
the
missionary
yesterday
i
preached
my
first
sermon
in
a
log
cabin
when
i
awoke
in
the
early
morning
and
looked
out
of
the
little
window
at
the
head
of
my
bed
in
the
rough
attic
a
new
world
seemed
to
break
on
my
sight
instead
of
the
narrow
noisy
streets
and
tenanted
blocks
of
the
populous
eastern
city
my
eyes
rested
on
one
vast
green
field
stretching
to
the
arching
horizon
over
which
brooded
a
profound
silence
intensified
by
the
sacred
hush
of
the
sabbath
my
host
offered
his
own
cabin
for
the
forenoon
service
his
son
a
sturdy
young
man
of
eighteen
inured
to
pioneer
life
had
ridden
far
and
wide
to
give
notice
of
the
meeting
and
he
was
confident
of
a
good
attendance
i
anticipated
the
labors
of
the
day
with
some
misgivings
for
i
had
become
slavishly
accustomed
to
the
use
of
written
sermons
but
here
before
a
audience
to
speak
from
manuscript
was
not
to
be
thought
of
for
once
at
least
i
must
trust
to
the
grace
of
christ
and
speak
as
the
spirit
gave
utterance
my
study
was
a
corner
of
the
loft
my
library
a
pocket
bible
where
do
all
these
people
come
from
i
ejaculated
in
pleased
surprise
as
for
a
full
hour
before
the
time
appointed
men
women
and
children
afoot
in
wagons
and
continued
to
arrive
and
through
the
cracks
in
the
unnailed
floor
i
could
see
members
of
the
family
engaged
in
contriving
sitting
accommodations
for
the
growing
congregation
unplaned
oaken
boards
placed
across
trunks
boxes
and
huge
blocks
soon
filled
the
room
every
seat
being
occupied
while
groups
of
men
stood
about
the
door
outside
or
sat
upon
the
embankment
i
would
have
a
full
house
certainly
and
what
effort
had
been
made
by
these
frontier
folk
to
attend
i
could
easily
imagine
some
had
walked
many
miles
for
the
purpose
most
had
come
quite
a
distance
and
the
earnest
thoughtful
faces
that
met
my
gaze
as
i
descended
the
ladder
and
read
the
opening
hymn
how
reverently
their
heads
were
bowed
for
prayer
and
with
what
hushed
interest
they
listened
to
the
discourse
i
can
not
soon
forget
one
woman
who
sat
surrounded
by
her
family
wept
from
the
announcement
of
the
text
till
the
close
of
the
sermon
wept
for
joy
that
once
more
after
long
deprivation
of
sanctuary
privileges
she
could
hear
the
word
of
god
it
was
a
scene
for
a
painter
that
log
cabin
crowded
with
representatives
of
every
state
in
the
union
in
every
variety
of
garb
and
of
all
ages
from
the
backwoodsman
to
the
babe
in
its
mother
arms
no
costly
organ
was
here
with
its
gentle
quiet
breathings
or
grand
and
massive
harmonies
no
trained
choir
no
consecrated
temple
with
its
sabbath
bell
and
spire
pointing
heavenward
no
carpeted
aisles
and
dim
religious
light
and
sculptured
cushioned
pulpit
but
i
could
not
doubt
the
presence
of
the
spirit
and
when
at
the
close
praise
god
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
was
sung
to
old
hundred
sung
as
if
with
one
voice
and
soul
the
clear
sweet
tones
of
childhood
blending
with
the
deeper
sounds
of
manhood
and
womanhood
the
rough
rude
building
seemed
as
the
gate
of
heaven
my
appointment
for
the
afternoon
was
at
a
small
settlement
eleven
miles
away
a
charming
drive
through
the
oak
openings
and
over
the
rolling
prairie
brought
us
to
the
cabin
which
was
to
serve
as
it
was
a
long
low
building
the
logs
of
which
it
was
constructed
still
rejoicing
in
their
primitive
covering
of
bark
the
openings
between
them
being
closed
with
clay
thrown
in
by
hand
the
owner
a
short
brisk
little
man
with
a
wooden
leg
gave
me
a
cordial
welcome
and
to
show
how
willing
he
was
to
have
the
meeting
in
his
cabin
pointed
to
his
shoemaker
bench
and
various
articles
of
furniture
including
a
bedstead
and
bedding
which
had
been
removed
from
the
room
and
piled
in
admirable
disorder
outside
you
have
been
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble
i
remarked
none
too
much
he
cheerily
replied
i
am
an
old
soldier
you
see
and
that
why
i
have
to
hobble
about
on
this
pointing
to
the
ancient
artificial
limb
i
was
in
the
war
of
belonged
to
the
cavalry
and
at
the
battle
of
husband
gently
interposed
his
wife
an
woman
with
a
face
expressive
of
goodness
the
minister
will
not
care
to
hear
of
war
adding
with
a
blush
you
must
excuse
us
sir
but
it
is
so
long
since
we
have
seen
one
of
your
profession
or
attended
religious
services
that
the
days
seem
too
much
alike
there
is
little
here
to
remind
us
that
the
sabbath
should
be
kept
holy
o
it
is
so
dreadful
so
like
heathenism
to
live
without
the
ordinances
of
the
gospel
no
sunday
school
for
our
children
and
youth
no
servant
of
god
to
counsel
the
dying
comfort
the
bereaved
and
point
the
to
christ
such
a
state
of
things
must
indeed
be
a
great
trial
to
those
who
love
the
saviour
i
observed
yes
and
what
adds
to
the
trial
she
continued
is
that
members
of
churches
after
they
have
been
here
awhile
fall
into
great
laxity
in
respect
to
the
lord
day
those
who
were
exemplary
east
are
here
seen
starting
upon
or
returning
from
a
business
journey
on
sunday
o
we
need
some
one
to
gather
these
straying
sheep
and
unite
them
by
the
public
means
of
grace
many
of
them
i
doubt
not
are
secretly
longing
for
this
for
more
than
a
year
i
have
been
praying
that
god
would
send
a
servant
of
his
this
way
and
sometimes
i
dare
say
you
have
felt
almost
discouraged
i
suggested
yes
she
replied
weeping
but
last
week
something
came
to
strengthen
my
faith
and
later
intelligence
that
you
were
to
visit
us
months
ago
i
wrote
east
for
a
donation
of
good
reading
to
scatter
among
the
settlers
but
received
no
response
till
last
tuesday
a
package
of
books
tracts
and
religious
papers
arrived
in
one
of
the
papers
was
an
article
entitled
pulpit
and
the
beech
tree
here
it
is
said
the
husband
passing
her
the
sheet
better
read
it
to
the
parson
there
be
plenty
of
time
afore
the
meeting
and
he
glanced
at
a
venerable
clock
screwed
to
a
log
over
the
fireplace
she
read
as
follows
nearly
a
score
of
years
ago
a
pioneer
sought
a
home
in
one
of
the
western
states
he
selected
a
section
in
a
dense
wilderness
and
soon
entered
upon
the
arduous
work
of
clearing
a
farm
he
was
a
man
of
athletic
constitution
and
well
adapted
to
cope
with
the
trials
on
the
frontier
he
was
in
the
prime
of
life
and
in
those
days
a
man
was
famous
according
as
he
had
axes
upon
the
thick
trees
this
man
was
ranked
among
the
leading
characters
in
that
region
he
could
bear
up
with
fortitude
under
all
trials
and
privations
except
those
of
a
religious
kind
before
his
removal
to
the
west
he
had
enjoyed
the
privileges
of
a
large
and
church
in
which
he
had
for
years
been
a
prominent
member
to
be
thus
suddenly
deprived
of
those
blessed
means
of
grace
caused
him
many
painful
feelings
and
at
times
almost
incapacitated
him
for
ordinary
duties
this
subject
pressed
so
heavily
on
his
mind
that
he
often
sought
relief
in
laying
his
wants
before
god
in
prayer
one
day
he
enjoyed
near
access
to
the
throne
while
on
his
knees
in
a
secluded
part
of
the
forest
he
prayed
earnestly
that
god
would
make
that
wilderness
and
solitary
place
glad
with
the
sound
of
the
gospel
he
asked
for
the
church
privileges
to
which
he
had
been
accustomed
and
he
felt
assured
that
god
could
grant
them
so
much
was
he
engaged
in
pleading
for
this
blessing
that
he
forgot
his
work
his
family
looked
for
his
return
to
dinner
but
he
came
not
they
were
alarmed
and
making
search
found
him
on
his
knees
to
this
man
of
god
there
was
something
peculiarly
pleasant
in
the
memory
of
that
approach
to
the
he
loved
the
spot
on
which
he
had
knelt
and
determined
to
mark
it
it
was
by
the
side
of
a
beech
tree
he
it
so
that
in
after
years
it
might
remind
him
of
the
incident
that
i
have
related
that
prayer
was
speedily
answered
god
put
it
into
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
that
region
to
build
a
sanctuary
in
the
desert
they
have
now
the
stated
means
of
grace
that
pioneer
is
one
of
the
officers
of
the
church
the
membership
is
near
eighty
the
cause
of
religion
seems
to
be
flourishing
among
them
not
long
since
it
was
my
privilege
to
preach
in
their
house
of
worship
it
was
filled
with
an
intelligent
congregation
at
the
close
of
the
services
the
old
man
gave
me
a
history
of
his
praying
under
the
beech
tree
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
closed
by
saying
tree
stood
only
about
five
feet
from
the
very
spot
where
you
stood
while
preaching
for
us
there
said
she
at
the
conclusion
of
the
narrative
i
felt
that
this
was
a
word
in
season
to
me
i
fell
upon
my
knees
and
with
increased
earnestness
pleaded
for
the
privileges
of
the
gospel
and
rose
feeling
as
did
the
pioneer
that
god
would
grant
the
request
but
how
did
my
heart
leap
with
glad
surprise
the
next
day
that
is
last
wednesday
when
a
neighbor
called
to
consult
me
about
a
place
for
you
to
preach
in
but
it
was
time
for
service
there
was
the
same
thronged
attendance
and
absorbed
attention
as
in
the
morning
how
delightful
to
proclaim
the
tidings
of
great
joy
to
those
who
are
hungering
for
the
word
of
life
how
different
from
ministering
to
fashionable
worldly
hearers
who
gather
in
the
house
of
god
for
intellectual
entertainment
or
from
motives
of
custom
respectability
or
ostentation
and
who
are
hardened
by
the
very
abundance
of
spiritual
instruction
at
the
close
of
the
services
with
the
social
freedom
of
western
intercourse
i
was
introduced
to
most
present
and
they
all
seemed
anxious
that
i
should
make
a
home
in
their
neighborhood
how
different
it
would
be
to
settle
with
this
new
people
on
the
precarious
subsistence
which
i
might
get
for
my
family
here
preaching
and
perhaps
keeping
house
in
a
log
cabin
from
the
situation
i
must
fill
should
i
accept
the
call
extended
by
the
large
and
wealthy
church
in
a
frontier
parish
on
a
prairie
on
the
outskirts
of
civilization
and
a
city
parish
what
a
contrast
but
my
heart
is
strongly
drawn
towards
this
people
should
i
remain
with
them
what
would
my
eastern
friends
say
i
have
passed
another
delightful
sabbath
notwithstanding
certain
trifling
violations
of
the
proprieties
of
worship
as
observed
in
eastern
assemblies
it
struck
me
quite
ludicrously
at
first
to
see
mother
listening
to
the
preaching
while
nursing
or
dandling
their
infants
yesterday
a
fat
burly
baby
who
by
some
singular
good
fortune
had
an
apple
for
we
never
see
that
fruit
here
let
it
drop
from
his
fat
fist
and
it
rolled
nearly
to
my
feet
and
the
mother
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
gravely
came
and
picked
it
up
and
returned
it
to
her
boy
nobody
however
was
disturbed
by
the
incident
all
appeared
to
take
it
as
a
matter
of
course
and
i
confess
i
like
this
absence
of
fastidious
conventionalities
why
should
the
mother
be
kept
from
the
house
of
god
because
she
may
not
bring
her
child
with
her
suffer
the
little
children
to
come
unto
me
and
forbid
them
not
said
the
great
preacher
when
the
disciples
would
drive
out
of
congregation
the
mothers
and
their
infants
is
the
servant
more
particular
than
his
lord
then
too
the
uncouth
garments
of
many
of
my
hearers
how
unlike
the
elegant
and
costly
apparel
worn
in
our
eastern
sanctuaries
but
i
like
the
western
way
best
as
to
dress
i
enjoy
seeing
the
poor
in
his
plain
attire
sitting
unabashed
by
the
side
of
the
man
in
goodly
apparel
and
when
i
consider
what
thousands
of
starving
souls
are
kept
out
of
christian
churches
because
they
can
not
dress
in
broadcloth
and
silk
and
how
much
money
is
wasted
and
vanity
indulged
by
the
bedizened
crowds
that
throng
our
sanctuaries
i
am
thankful
that
the
reign
of
fashion
is
unknown
on
the
frontier
but
these
hardy
pioneers
are
bold
and
independent
thinkers
the
preacher
must
show
himself
a
workman
that
needeth
not
to
be
ashamed
dividing
the
word
of
truth
if
he
would
keep
his
hold
on
their
respect
it
will
not
do
to
be
careless
even
in
teaching
the
sabbath
school
i
was
suddenly
reminded
of
this
yesterday
speaking
on
the
subject
of
benevolence
i
had
remarked
that
the
poorest
of
us
if
we
were
careful
not
to
waste
might
have
something
that
we
could
spare
as
well
as
not
to
those
needier
than
ourselves
and
i
inquired
if
any
scholar
could
tell
me
what
scripture
enforced
this
lesson
as
no
one
responded
i
read
the
account
of
the
multiplying
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
when
christ
fed
the
fainting
multitudes
and
coming
to
the
words
gather
up
the
fragments
that
nothing
be
lost
i
asked
do
not
these
words
show
that
we
ought
to
save
the
pieces
that
we
may
give
them
to
the
hungry
no
sir
promptly
answered
a
lad
of
about
sixteen
thinking
he
had
misunderstood
the
question
i
repeated
it
saying
i
asked
thomas
for
that
was
the
boy
name
if
this
language
does
not
teach
that
we
should
save
what
we
are
apt
to
throw
away
that
we
may
have
something
to
give
the
poor
i
do
not
think
it
does
he
replied
why
not
i
inquired
jesus
told
the
disciples
to
share
the
nice
new
loaves
with
the
people
and
to
keep
the
bits
and
ends
for
themselves
he
was
right
i
had
unconsciously
been
making
that
great
miracle
of
mercy
teach
stinginess
how
often
i
had
heard
it
explained
to
polished
audiences
in
new
england
in
the
same
way
and
not
a
criticism
offered
yet
the
one
who
pointed
out
this
error
was
a
child
belonging
to
one
of
the
most
thriftless
of
these
frontier
families
his
name
is
jones
and
he
is
i
think
a
lad
of
promise
in
whom
i
am
becoming
much
interested
as
also
in
his
father
a
restless
singular
being
but
who
is
more
of
a
man
in
my
judgment
than
he
seems
i
am
getting
to
feel
more
and
more
deeply
that
duty
calls
me
to
labor
here
if
it
were
not
for
my
dear
wife
and
children
i
should
decide
at
once
to
remain
but
how
could
she
get
along
in
this
place
can
she
relinquish
the
comforts
of
her
eastern
home
and
share
with
me
for
the
master
sake
the
privations
of
the
wilderness
the
settlers
are
kind
and
say
we
shall
not
suffer
a
subscription
paper
has
been
started
and
has
already
a
goodly
array
of

tom
victory
tom
retired
to
bed
the
night
after
his
mother
had
confided
to
him
the
history
of
his
father
business
trials
feeling
that
she
had
conferred
an
honor
upon
him
in
thus
sharing
with
him
her
and
that
he
understood
his
parents
as
he
never
did
before
he
was
conscious
also
that
she
had
put
him
under
new
obligation
to
be
always
frank
with
her
as
she
had
been
with
him
that
she
had
in
fact
made
the
obligation
very
sacred
for
he
realized
that
it
was
an
act
of
condescension
in
her
thus
to
make
him
the
repository
of
her
secrets
while
to
share
his
with
her
was
but
the
duty
of
a
child
and
for
his
own
advantage
and
he
thought
how
can
i
now
desert
the
family
for
any
imaginary
good
and
leave
her
to
reproach
me
by
her
patient
for
dear
father
and
the
children
sake
it
cost
him
a
bitter
struggle
to
act
in
accordance
with
this
view
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
he
wrestled
long
and
hard
to
put
down
the
wish
to
free
himself
from
the
burden
that
was
now
laid
upon
his
conscience
he
the
squatter
son
in
his
wretched
life
had
built
up
a
golden
future
for
himself
as
the
ambitious
young
of
every
condition
are
sure
to
do
when
once
the
heart
is
roused
to
wish
and
the
mind
to
plan
for
great
things
and
now
to
give
it
all
up
and
come
down
to
the
cheerless
drudgery
of
in
a
home
it
could
not
be
expected
that
he
could
do
this
only
after
a
severe
conflict
with
his
own
nature
if
at
all
it
is
true
his
mother
had
exhorted
him
to
wait
for
providence
to
open
the
door
before
him
but
he
could
not
help
recalling
with
an
aching
heart
through
how
many
long
weary
years
she
had
waited
and
what
door
of
relief
had
been
opened
for
her
and
was
she
not
a
thousand
fold
more
deserving
of
such
an
interposition
than
he
he
reflected
on
this
point
till
his
brain
was
in
a
whirl
the
more
he
pondered
the
matter
the
darker
it
seemed
i
am
called
he
reasoned
to
keep
by
the
family
if
i
never
see
brighter
days
that
the
meaning
of
her
words
and
the
demands
of
my
lot
am
i
ready
to
do
this
to
be
true
to
duty
if
it
involves
as
it
has
to
her
poverty
seclusion
from
privileges
toil
suffering
obscurity
he
knew
that
he
ought
thus
to
decide
and
to
decide
cheerfully
but
he
could
not
he
tried
again
and
again
to
reach
the
decision
only
to
recoil
from
it
his
will
was
powerless
to
calm
the
rebellion
within
ah
the
pioneer
ragged
son
had
been
precipitated
into
a
solemn
moral
crisis
which
tested
him
and
showed
him
how
weak
he
was
the
tumult
of
feeling
and
sharpness
of
the
battle
had
at
length
cast
him
into
utter
despair
when
his
mother
remark
concerning
his
mistake
in
setting
about
getting
rich
by
the
strength
of
his
own
will
abruptly
recurred
to
him
what
did
she
mean
by
that
he
asked
and
he
sat
bolt
upright
in
bed
to
consider
the
point
he
could
not
however
quite
master
the
idea
and
wished
his
mother
was
awake
that
she
might
explain
herself
then
his
mind
returned
to
the
subject
and
lo
the
mist
rolled
away
and
the
truth
shone
out
i
see
it
father
should
have
sought
direction
and
strength
of
god
and
that
is
just
what
i
ought
to
do
he
can
give
me
grace
to
perform
my
duty
yes
even
to
choose
it
and
tom
under
the
inspiration
of
the
light
that
was
breaking
in
upon
his
soul
resolved
i
ask
god
to
enable
me
to
do
as
mother
has
advised
and
as
i
see
to
be
right
in
the
circumstances
and
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
he
lifted
up
his
heart
in
prayer
as
he
prayed
a
heavenly
peace
seemed
to
pervade
his
whole
being
it
stole
upon
him
so
gently
and
unexpectedly
that
he
felt
like
shouting
praises
to
god
and
at
last
unable
to
keep
his
marvellous
happiness
to
himself
he
called
softly
mother
mother
what
do
you
wish
my
son
she
asked
always
ready
to
answer
her
children
calls
o
mother
he
replied
i
have
been
struggling
and
praying
and
got
the
victory
instantly
she
was
kneeling
on
the
rough
floor
by
his
side
she
understood
him
and
tears
of
grateful
joy
ran
down
her
face
and
she
said
it
is
as
i
would
have
it
tom
god
has
taken
you
up
and
all
will
be
well
next
morning
tom
arose
with
a
peaceful
serious
face
his
mother
did
not
allude
to
the
happy
change
that
had
transpired
within
him
during
the
night
but
as
she
busied
herself
about
breakfast
she
would
occasionally
wipe
away
the
tears
for
her
heart
was
full
mother
said
he
as
they
finished
their
frugal
meal
i
been
thinking
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
get
up
all
the
wood
we
can
while
the
weather
is
pleasant
winter
be
coming
along
by
and
by
and
it
be
so
nice
to
have
a
warm
fire
all
the
time
then
and
not
have
to
wade
through
the
snow
after
something
to
burn
yes
she
replied
we
have
not
had
our
indian
summer
yet
and
while
that
lasts
we
shall
use
but
little
fuel
and
if
you
and
the
children
are
smart
you
can
get
quite
a
pile
ahead
why
is
the
beautiful
spell
we
have
in
fall
called
indian
summer
he
asked
because
replied
his
mother
the
indians
were
in
the
habit
of
attacking
the
white
settlements
then
they
do
go
on
their
war
expeditions
after
cold
weather
sets
in
and
she
added
sighing
i
shall
be
glad
when
snow
comes
for
i
shall
feel
that
we
are
safe
until
spring
opens
the
allens
are
dreadful
mad
about
their
cattle
remarked
tom
the
old
man
tracked
them
to
a
ravine
in
the
woods
and
found
that
his
oxen
had
been
killed
and
dressed
the
horns
and
hide
lay
on
the
ground
and
the
blood
was
scarcely
cold
but
not
an
indian
was
to
be
seen
he
could
even
find
a
trail
and
he
an
old
you
know
have
any
indians
been
seen
near
here
since
yes
payson
the
missionary
saw
one
the
other
morning
as
he
was
going
from
root
river
settlement
to
slough
creek
he
was
passing
the
norwegian
cabin
near
the
grove
when
suddenly
a
sioux
galloped
by
on
his
pony
giving
a
loud
whoop
as
he
rode
out
of
sight
and
pingry
had
a
great
scare
her
husband
was
away
after
supplies
and
she
was
alone
about
her
work
when
the
door
opened
and
an
indian
stalked
in
and
took
a
seat
pretty
soon
a
second
came
and
did
the
same
and
then
another
until
a
dozen
sat
round
the
room
silently
smoking
their
pipes
she
says
she
knew
by
their
manner
and
the
way
they
were
painted
that
they
intended
mischief
she
determined
however
not
to
appear
frightened
and
went
on
with
her
work
soon
one
of
them
got
up
and
broke
open
her
husband
trunk
and
then
the
rest
fell
to
rummaging
the
house
helping
themselves
to
whatever
they
wished
and
she
was
expecting
they
would
next
assault
her
when
to
her
relief
she
heard
the
barking
of
a
dog
and
the
rumbling
of
wheels
at
which
the
savages
took
alarm
and
in
a
moment
were
gone
and
what
asked
jones
do
the
settlers
think
of
this
o
they
only
laugh
about
it
they
do
expect
any
serious
trouble
they
say
that
the
chiefs
have
had
a
grand
talk
with
the
government
agent
and
declare
that
they
wish
to
be
on
good
terms
with
us
but
some
of
our
people
do
all
they
can
to
provoke
the
indians
and
say
they
would
like
to
have
a
brush
with
the
but
what
that
he
exclaimed
as
loud
shouts
and
the
barking
of
dogs
broke
on
their
ears
jones
and
tom
hurried
to
the
door
and
saw
some
men
and
boys
chasing
a
large
animal
across
the
prairie
a
bear
a
bear
cried
a
neighbor
rushing
breathlessly
up
to
tom
saying
is
your
father
at
home
tell
him
to
come
on
and
we
pepper
his
carcass
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
or
explaining
whose
carcass
he
meant
he
hastened
after
the
others
the
creature
that
they
were
pursuing
was
so
fat
that
he
did
not
run
very
swiftly
and
the
dogs
gained
on
him
aware
of
which
he
was
making
desperate
efforts
to
gain
the
shelter
of
a
small
grove
not
far
off
while
stringing
along
for
quite
a
distance
behind
were
his
pursuers
some
were
hatless
a
few
had
guns
but
most
were
armed
with
pitchforks
or
clubs
and
one
man
in
his
zeal
carried
a
piece
of
rusty
although
what
use
he
proposed
to
put
it
to
in
capturing
bruin
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
unless
he
intended
should
bear
gain
the
grove
to
him
with
it
the
truth
is
he
was
putting
up
a
stove
in
his
cabin
when
the
cry
of
bear
bear
interrupted
his
labors
and
he
joined
the
chase
forgetting
that
he
held
anything
in
his
hand
he
was
wiry
lank
and
with
sandy
hair
that
came
down
straight
and
thin
upon
his
shoulders
and
being
without
his
coat
with
pants
that
reached
only
half
way
between
his
knees
and
ankles
he
cut
a
ludicrous
figure
as
he
straddled
on
followed
by
a
short
dumpy
man
who
waddle
as
ambitiously
as
he
might
swiftly
fell
behind
without
however
seeming
in
the
least
discouraged
there
they
are
surrounding
the
grove
said
tom
as
the
men
and
boys
spread
out
from
the
centre
till
they
had
encompassed
bruin
leafy
retreat
soon
there
was
the
report
of
guns
and
not
long
after
the
hunters
returned
looking
tired
and
disappointed
the
bear
must
have
got
away
said
jones
but
charley
came
rushing
towards
her
and
throwing
up
his
cap
cried
o
is
it
fun
it
was
a
bear
mother
it
was
only
black
hog
that
he
lost
last
fall
and
thought
was
dead
he
had
run
wild
feeding
on
roots
and
acorns
and
was
awful
fat
but
they
know
was
a
hog
till
they
shot
him
the
dogs
kept
up
such
a
yelping
and
the
grass
and
bushes
hid
him
so
they
gone
after
a
wagon
to
take
him
home
but
tom
was
at
work
making
an
opening
in
the
fence
nearest
the
woods
seeing
which
charley
called
out
what
you
doing
that
for
tom
i
been
thinking
answered
tom
pleasantly
that
we
shall
want
some
wood
near
the
cabin
next
winter
instead
of
digging
it
out
of
the
snow
and
i
fixing
a
place
to
drag
it
through
yes
children
added
the
mother
tom
and
i
have
been
talking
it
over
suppose
you
take
hold
together
and
see
how
big
a
pile
you
can
get
up
it
will
be
so
nice
to
have
plenty
of
wood
to
cook
the
with
and
keep
us
comfortable
when
it
freezing
weather
the
project
pleased
the
youngsters
even
to
bub
and
headed
by
tom
they
began
at
once
to
put
it
into
execution
it
is
customary
in
new
countries
for
the
first
comers
to
help
themselves
freely
to
the
trees
on
government
land
for
logs
with
which
to
construct
their
cabins
and
to
rive
into
shingles
and
saw
into
boards
and
many
a
sinewy
oak
had
fallen
before
the
frontiersman
axe
in
the
woods
near
the
joneses
leaving
the
brawny
limbs
upon
the
ground
there
were
also
many
dead
trees
still
standing
and
from
these
sources
dry
hard
wood
of
the
best
quality
could
always
be
obtained
tom
directed
operations
the
limbs
and
small
dead
trees
were
thrown
or
dragged
in
piles
a
certain
distance
towards
the
field
from
there
another
took
them
to
the
opening
in
the
fence
and
from
thence
others
of
the
youngsters
pulled
them
up
to
the
house
the
girls
and
boys
had
a
merry
time
of
it
sarah
making
the
woods
ring
with
her
voice
as
she
sang
at
her
task
while
many
a
joke
was
exchanged
by
the
lively
little
company
but
no
one
of
them
entered
on
the
labor
with
more
zeal
and
a
higher
appreciation
of
his
own
services
than
bub
that
child
is
always
under
foot
said
eliza
as
she
stumbled
over
him
while
tugging
along
a
scrawny
limb
you
ought
to
go
into
the
house
said
tom
i
afraid
you
get
hurt
no
i
wo
answered
the
child
tause
i
dot
to
tarry
in
the
wood
and
seizing
a
long
branch
under
one
dimpled
arm
and
a
short
heavy
one
under
the
other
to
make
good
his
words
with
the
will
of
an
older
head
he
started
for
the
cabin
out
from
under
his
arm
would
be
wrenched
the
long
one
by
some
bush
beside
the
path
and
bub
would
pick
it
up
and
pull
at
it
until
it
had
cleared
itself
when
down
would
go
the
big
piece
from
the
other
arm
then
he
would
bravely
lift
it
again
his
baby
frock
going
up
with
it
and
thus
dropping
his
load
and
picking
it
up
with
an
occasional
tumble
which
he
would
not
cry
about
he
reached
the
house
dragging
his
load
in
through
the
door
to
the
imminent
danger
of
knocking
over
the
old
stove
he
now
rested
from
his
labors
to
eat
a
cold
potato
and
a
piece
of
his
mother
which
while
disposing
of
he
dropped
asleep
his
rosy
cheeks
crammed
to
their
utmost
capacity
pooh
cried
charley
coming
noisily
in
to
see
if
dinner
was
most
ready
why

rest
of
us
bub
resumed
eating
and
replied
dignifiedly
tause
i
found
out
that
it
was
fun
the
unexpected
effect
of
his
answer
on
charley
who
received
it
with
uproarious
laughter
highly
offended
the
child
and
when
charley
was
out
of

he
said
to
his
mother

inquired
tause

a
surprise

tell
me

a
conveyance
for
myself
and
children
to

minnesota
inquired
a
lady
of
the
attentive
clerk
at
a
hotel
in
the
thriving
young
town
of
dacotah
iowa
there
is
no
stage
running
to
that
point
he
replied
but
we
can
send
a
team
with
you
if
you
wish
to
go
to
so
much
expense
i
would
like
answered
the
lady
smiling
to
get
there
with
as
little
cost
as
i
can
my
husband

a
missionary
i
am
on
my
way
to
join
him
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
for

returned
the
clerk
bowing
respectfully
and
stepping
into
the
he
asked
is
there
any
one
here
going
to
l
i
shall
go
half
way
there
said
a
short
man
who
sat
reading
an
eastern
paper
could
you
take
a
passenger
or
two
i
pretty
well
loaded
he
answered
but
i
always

room
for
one
more
seeing
it
pays
it
a
clergyman
wife
and

said
the
clerk
in
a
lower
tone
o
well
replied
the
other
rising
to
his
feet
they
shall
go
along

or

and
he
followed
the
clerk
who
introduced
the
parties
to
each
other
with
sawyer
payson
he
will
take
you
as
far
as
he
goes

how

she
inquired
about
twenty
miles
but
how
shall
i
get
over
the
remainder
of
the
distance

be
concerned
about
that
replied
the
man
heartily
i
guess
there
be
a
way
to
forward
you
all
right
and
in
a
half
hour
his
team
was
before
the
door
waiting
to
take
her
farther
into
the
wilderness
a
pair
of
stout
harnessed
into
a
long
open
wagon
affording
space
for
a
large
variety
of
boxes
and
packages
and
three
rows
of
cushionless
seats
constituted
the
conveyance
its
owner
had
been
on
a
trading
expedition
but
with
an
eye
to
the
main
chance
was
prepared
to
catch
some
of
the
travel
going
westward
the
wagon
was
crowded
with
passengers
and
disposing
of
the
three
children
a
delicate
intelligent
little
boy
and
his
two
sisters
in
the
laps
of
those
already
seated
the
teamster
assisted
the
mother
to
a
seat
at
his
side
their
presence
it
was
evident
excited
much
interest
for
the
manner
and
dress
of
the
little
family
betrayed
new
england
birth
and
culture
your
husband
said
the
owner
of
the
conveyance
as
his
horses
trotted
sturdily
along

up
with
me
the
other
day
he
had
been
down
to
the
mississippi
waiting
for
you
a
whole
week
and
the
landlord
at
mcgreggor
landing
said
he
was
the
bluest
man
he
ever
saw
because
you
did
not
arrive
i
am
sorry
that
he
was
anxious
on
my
account
replied
the
wife
with
a
merry
laugh
he
did
wish
me
to
venture
on
the
journey
alone
with
the
children
and
wrote
that
he
would
return
for
me
if
i
could
not
find
suitable
company
but
not
wishing
to
take
him
from
his
labors
i
packed
up
and
took
our
darlings
along
i
hope
you
did
meet
with
any
accident
on
the
way
observed
a
man
on
the
back
seat
you
was
pretty
resolute
no
but
i
came
near
losing
one
of
my
little
girls
how
did
it
happen
asked
a
woman
it
was
in
the
depot
at
springfield
the
children
were
thirsty
and
charging
them
not
to
stir
until
i
came
back
i
crossed
the
room
for
water
there
was
a
great
crowd
rushing
here
and
there
trains
were
coming
and
going
all
was
bustle
and
confusion
and
i
hurried
not
having
been
away
but
a
moment
but
little
fannie
my
youngest
girl
was
missing
helen
the
eldest
had
been
so
taken
up
with
the
sights
and
sounds
about
her
that
she
did
not
know
that
her
sister
was
gone
i
was
almost
frantic
with
fear
she
had
so
suddenly
and
completely
disappeared
so
throwing
my
bonnet
back
upon
my
shoulders
to
attract
attention
i
cried
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
my
child
my
child
i
lost
my
child
child
lost
child
lost
shouted
a
number
of
voices
repeating
the
description
i
gave
of
her
nobody
seemed
to
have
seen
her
and
a
terrible
dread
that
i
might
not
find
her
wrung
my
heart
when
to
my
joy
above
the
din
i
heard
some
one
exclaim
she
found
she
found
where
the
mother
and
a
gentleman
holding
her
aloft
brought
her
to
me
he
was
deeply
agitated
and
said
your
little
girl

very
near
being
killed
i
found
her
under
the
car
between
two
of
the
wheels
playing
with
them
saying
may
hurt
a
me
car
may
hurt
a
me
the
last
bell
had
rung
and
i
had
barely
time
to
drag
her
off
the
track
when
the
train
started
it
must
have
been
a
great
care
for
you
remarked
a
passenger
to
bring
your
children
on
so
long
a
journey
it
was
indeed
she
replied
generally
the
worst
part
of
it
was
in
getting
them
into
the
trains
the
children
are
so
small
and
the
rush
of
passengers
so
great
that
they
were
in
danger
of
being
trampled
on
or
prevented
from
getting
aboard
in
season
everybody
looks
out
for
number
one
at
such
times
said
a
man
i
often
think
that
we
see
more
of
the
selfishness
of
human
nature
while
travelling
than
under
any
other
circumstances
i
suppose
you
were
left
to
get
along
as
best
you
could
with
your
little
ones
usually
she
replied
sometimes
however
a
stranger
bound
the
same
way
would
give
us
a
helping
hand
but
often
he
would
blunder
so
as
to
make
matters
worse
once
i
was
both
amused
and
frightened
i
was
struggling
to
place
my
children
on
a
train
just
starting
and
making
little
headway
i
called
out
some
one
help
my
children
into
the
cars
when
one
of
the
largest
fattest
men
i
ever
saw
who
was
panting
and
puffing
from
his
unusual
efforts
at
hurrying
caught
up
my
little
boy
and
trotting
on
like
an
elephant
he
struck
his
foot
against
a
stone
and
came
down
sprawling
into
the
sand
uttering
a
great
wild
cry
and
giving
my
little
boy
a
throw
at
the
same
time
i
felt
sorry
for
the
man
but
thought
i
should
die
laughing
at
the
queer
figure
he
cut
and
ungrateful
as
it
seemed
i
was
obliged
in
going
for
my
boy
to
pass
around
our
huge
friend
and
ride
off
leaving
him
to
pick
himself
up
at
his
leisure
there
was
much
merriment
at
this
recital
which
was
increased
by
a
portly
englishman
behind
her
saying
in
a
jolly
way
hi
feel
as
if
hi
could
happreciate
that
story
mem
but
how
do
you
think
you
like
living
west
asked
the
motherly
woman
it
seems
to
me
that
the
likes
of
you
wo
know
how
to
put
up
with
our
rough
ways
o
replied
the
clergyman
wife
with
an
enthusiasm
which
showed
what
manner
of
spirit
she
was
of
i
did
not
come
out
here
for
enjoyment
but
to
cheer
and
help
my
husband
in
laboring
for
christ
well
answered
the
other
wiping
a
tear
from
her
eye
the
land
knows
we
need
such
folks
among
us
and
if
we
do
have
things
as
nice
as
you
do
your
way
i
hope
you
find
us
westerners
ready
to
do
what
we
can
for
the
good
cause
most
of
us
have
seen
better
times
and
have
known
what
it
was
to
go
to
meeting
every
sunday
and
do
our
mite
towards
supporting
preaching
and
we
are
willing
to
do
it
again
see
mother
exclaimed
little
helen
a
bright
miss
of
six
years
what
a
large
garden
the
team
had
passed
the
irregular
ridges
of
the
bluffs
extending
inland
from
the
mississippi
and
had
attained
the
summit
of
a
gentle
swell
of
land
commanding
an
extensive
prairie
view
and
the
whole
landscape
was
bedecked
with
flowers
of
every
hue
and
shape
the
child
wondering
eyes
danced
with
delight
and
she
said
mother
is
the
man
who
owns
this
great
garden
very
rich
this
do
belong
to
any
one
man
my
dear
replied
her
mother
smiling
it
is
one
of
gardens
he
planted
all
these
flowers
and
made
them
grow
without
anybody
help
all
these
are
wild
flowers
o
exclaimed
the
child
how
good
he
is
is
he
mother
has
god
such
a
garden
where
our
new
home
is
i
expect
he
has
she
answered
for
out
here
my
child
it
almost
all
garden
you
might
ride
thousands
of
miles
and
not
see
a
stone
or
any
sand
nothing
but
the
green
grass
and
the
sweet
blooming
flowers
o
cried
clapping
her
hands
i
so
glad
we
come
west
are
you
mother
the
passengers
were
delighted
with
the
prattle
of
the
dear
girl
and
the
matronly
lady
who
had
her
in
charge
could
not
forbear
giving
her
a
kiss
and
said
i
hope
you
will
meet
with
nothing
more
unpleasant
than
prairie
flowers
but
just
then
the
child
bright
eyes
caught
sight
of
a
settler
pursuing
his
lonely
way
with
his
gun
on
his
shoulder
his
tall
figure
standing
in
bold
relief
against
the
sky
although
he
was
several
miles
in
the
distance
and
she
asked
mamma
is
that
a
wild
man
and
later
seeing
a
cow
grazing
she
inquired
is
that
a
wild
cow
the
next
night
about
sundown
sawyer
deposited
the
family
at
lincoln
snug
western
cottage
well
said
lincoln
laughing
as
she
took
her
guest
things
you
stolen
a
march
on
your
husband
this
time
is
he
here
asked
payson
with
a
disappointed
air
no
she
replied
he
spent
a
week
at
the
mississippi
waiting
for
you
and
fearing
you
might
get
carried
by
or
injured
in
leaving
the
steamer
for
you
know
little
ceremony
is
used
towards
passengers
or
their
goods
he
visited
each
boat
as
it
arrived
and
had
the
porter
at
the
hotel
call
him
up
at
every
boat
through
the
night
inquiring
of
the
passengers
if
they
had
seen
a
lady
of
your
description
with
three
young
children
and
hearing
since
he
returned
that
one
resembling
you
had
gone
to
the
landing
higher
up
on
the
river
he
went
there
yesterday
hoping
to
meet
you
and
bring
you
back
with
him
probably
get
here
late
this
evening
and
wo
we
give
him
a
surprise
it
was
about
nine
when
the
missionary
returned
alone
anxious
and
dejected
you
do
look
as
if
you
found
your
lost
wife
and
babies
said
his
host
sympathizingly
no
and
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
it
i
inquired
thoroughly
i
looked
the
papers
over
also
but
did
not
find
that
there
had
been
any
railroad
accident
of
late
i
am
afraid
she
has
been
taken
sick
on
the
way
it
was
barbarous
in
me
to
listen
a
moment
to
the
idea
of
her
coming
all
the
way
alone
with
three
children
from
massachusetts
to
minnesota
i
ought
to
have
insisted
on
her
remaining
at
home
until
i
could
have
gone
for
her
perhaps
suggested
lincoln
she
thought
it
was
prudent
to
venture
on
such
a
journey
and
wrote
you
so
but
the
letter
has
miscarried
i
know
her
too
well
to
think
so
responded
the
minister
she
has
started
on
her
way
here
she
had
decided
to
do
so
as
a
matter
of
duty
and
having
made
her
mind
up
on
that
point
she
would
come
right
on
if
she
met
with
a
railroad
accident
every
other
train
if
she
is
a
delicate
little
body
well
you
look
tired
enough
to
drop
said
lincoln
abruptly
turning
her
head
to
conceal
a
smile
i
think
you
had
better
retire
early
the
clergyman
was
quite
taken
aback
at
this
piece
of
advice
but
lincoln
relieved
his
astonishment
by
saying
my
wife
hoping
that
you
might
be
cheered
by
the
arrival
of
your
family
has
been
fixing
up
your
room
a
bit
and
i
suppose
she
rest
unless
she
sees
how
you
like
the
improvements
and
lincoln
opening
the
door
into
his
apartment
the
missionary
saw
before
him
his
three
children
sleeping
peacefully
in
their
nice
beds
and
his
wife
seated
in
a
exercising
a
world
of
in
order
to
carry
out
the
plot
of
surprising
him
chapter
x
no
whiskey
at
this
raising
if
the
scottish
bard
found
it
a
hard
experience
that
best
laid
schemes
of
mice
and
men
gang
oft
in
staid
old
scotland
how
would
he
have
sung
if
his
lot
had
been
cast
amid
the
vicissitudes
of
frontier
life
on
an
american
prairie
we
speak
of
the
uncertainties
of
all
earthly
expectations
where
society
organized
helps
man
in
a
thousand
ways
to
achieve
his
plans
but
there
is
nothing
settled
in
a
new
country
everything
is
in
embryo
and
therefore
disappointments
are
indefinitely
multiplied
when
the
immigrant
arrives
at
his
destination
he
soon
finds
that
his
most
reasonable
projects
prove
to
be
the
veriest
and
that
his
reliance
must
be
on
providence
and
his
own
strong
arm
this
state
of
things
is
specially
trying
to
the
man
of
small
means
and
unaccustomed
to
physical
toil
as
was
the
case
with
payson
the
settlers
especially
those
of
religious
character
had
made
in
true
western
style
many
and
generous
promises
to
induce
him
to
live
among
them
they
designed
to
keep
their
engagements
with
him
but
a
thousand
contingencies
were
continually
arising
which
they
could
not
foresee
to
render
the
fulfilment
of
their
agreements
impossible
but
perhaps
no
failure
in
this
direction
had
tried
the
missionary
so
much
as
that
connected
with
the
erection
of
a
palmer
had
voluntarily
made
him
the
offer
of
money
for
that
purpose
and
if
any
man
could
be
depended
upon
it
was
he
but
he
had
invested
his
funds
in
the
new
town
he
was
a
prudent
man
and
when
the
proposal
was
made
him
by
the
two
proprietors
to
join
them
in
the
enterprise
he
was
disinclined
to
do
so
they
were
irreligious
men
stirring
energetic
workers
but
devoid
of
interest
in
things
unseen
and
therefore
could
not
be
expected
to
care
for
the
present
and
future
moral
condition
of
the
settlement
yet
we
should
do
them
the
justice
to
say
that
they
were
not
indifferent
to
the
religious
welfare
of
their
village
only
that
not
being
religious
men
they
would
not
take
the
matter
in
charge
themselves
they
needed
a
leader
both
to
plan
and
to
set
a
wholesome
example
and
this
was
one
reason
for
their
asking
palmer
to
become
a
partner
this
reason
was
a
weighty
one
with
him
but
before
deciding
the
question
he
consulted
with
payson
laying
the
whole
matter
before
him
he
asked
what
do
you
think
of
my
engaging
in
this
thing
i
do
hope
he
answered
that
if
you
can
make
it
pecuniarily
successful
you
will
become
a
town
owner
i
should
feel
that
i
had
a
pillar
to
lean
upon
in
all
my
endeavors
for
the
social
and
religious
good
of
this
people
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
can
be
no
risk
in
it
we
have
everything
here
to
make
a
town
timber
limestone
quarries
for
building
material
abundance
of
clean
prairie
land
for
agricultural
purposes
and
sooner
or
later
a
railroad
must
pass
very
near
here
as
it
is
on
the
great
travelled
route
to
the
important
points
west
and
north
emigration
is
coming
in
well
we
have
a
religious
meeting
established
and
i
hope
soon
we
shall
have
a
school
that
is
the
way
it
seems
to
me
said
palmer
and
it
appears
also
that
i
might
do
a
great
deal
of
good
by
using
aright
the
power
a
town
owner
might
have
so
he
decided
to
make
the
investment
but
mishap
after
mishap
occurred
to
thwart
the
enterprises
of
the
town
owners
and
while
their
expenses
were
large
the
returns
were
so
small
that
palmer
came
to
the
preacher
one
day
and
with
emotion
said
payson
i
fear
i
shall
have
to
disappoint
you
about
the
money
i
promised
to
let
you
have
for
the
building
of
your
cottage
this
was
a
heavy
blow
to
the
missionary
and
his
friend
knew
too
well
that
it
would
be
for
payson
had
set
his
heart
on
having
a
comfortable
home
provided
for
his
family
when
they
should
arrive
many
a
pleasant
bit
of
correspondence
had
passed
between
himself
and
wife
on
the
subject
of
the
pretty
white
cottage
on
the
lot
adjoining
the
town
and
the
joy
of
meeting
her
was
overshadowed
by
the
thought
that
she
had
come
to
a
homeless
wilderness
while
expecting
something
so
different
and
when
she
asked
repeatedly
if
the
cottage
was
ready
and
when
he
was
going
to
take
her
to
see
it
in
his
unhappiness
he
avoided
a
direct
reply
which
with
the
ominous
silence
of
the
good
friends
by
whom
they
were
entertained
led
her
to
conjecture
how
matters
stood
and
one
day
she
lifted
the
weight
in
a
measure
from
his
heart
by
saying
it
would
be
very
strange
while
almost
everybody
in
a
new
country
are
obliged
to
live
in
log
cabins
if
we
should
be
enough
better
off
to
put
up
a
framed
house
i
do
believe
you
have
been
able
to
yet
it
is
too
much
to
expect
but
never
mind
if
others
can
live
within
log
walls
for
the
sake
of
making
money
we
certainly
can
for
a
higher
motive
just
like
yourself
said
he
gratefully
relating
the
facts
as
we
have
recited
them
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
she
inquired
we
ought
not
to
think
of
accepting
the
hospitality
of
this
family
much
longer
their
house
is
already
so
crowded
it
puts
them
to
great
inconvenience
i
am
aware
of
it
said
her
husband
palmer
has
a
little
cabin
which
he
has
offered
me
for
temporary
use
until
i
can
put
up
something
on
my
claim
but
it
is
so
rough
and
lonely
that
on
your
account
i
have
not
felt
like
saying
anything
to
you
about
it
o
said
she
merrily
do
take
me
there
it
would
be
so
romantic
to
live
in
a
log
cabin
so
their
host
team
being
chartered
they
went
to
look
at
the
rent
it
was
a
funny
wee
loggery
hastily
put
up
for
purpose
standing
in
a
small
enclosed
field
near
the
river
two
miles
from
town
the
nearest
neighbor
being
jones
who
lived
a
mile
and
a
half
farther
down
the
stream
palmer
in
anticipation
of
the
visit
had
been
there
before
them
and
put
in
a
whole
glass
window
laid
the
rough
boards
that
constituted
the
floor
more
closely
and
put
up
some
shelves
for
a
cupboard
in
a
corner
this
is
elegance
itself
exclaimed
the
little
woman
laughing
heartily
get
a
few
chairs
and
a
stove
husband
and
we
move
right
in
and
see
she
added
looking
out
of
the
door
there
are
potatoes
here
that
have
not
been
dug
quite
a
crop
perhaps
you
can
buy
the
right
to
use
them
o
yes
replied
her
husband
brother
palmer
says
we
can
have
the
use
of
the
cabin
free
and
all
there
is
about
it
the
fish
in
the
river
too
i
suppose
said
she
stepping
to
the
fence
and
peering
over
the
river
brink
i
reckon
you
wo
get
fish
enough
to
get
sick
on
them
said
a
voice
near
and
jones
emerged
from
a
clump
of
bushes
his
gun
on
his
shoulder
this
is
our
neighbor
said
the
minister
my
wife
mr
jones
looking
up
a
cage
to
put
your
bird
in
asked
the
squatter
the
minister
replied
affirmatively
you
found
that
lot
just
as
i
told
ye
did
ye
he
asked
precisely
and
did
your
smith
give
it
up
like
a
christian
he
pursued
i
suppose
i
am
the
proprietor
of
it
now
said
the
minister
and
he
did
charge
you
anything
for
giving
up
what
was
not
his
did
he
no
said
the
missionary
he
did
not
charge
me
anything
for
the
claim
although
he
seemed
to
think
it
right
that
i
should
give
him
something
for
the
improvements
improvements
yes
i
suppose
he
expects
some
pay
for
the
saw
logs
he
stole
from
the
lot
while
he
had
acres
on
acres
of
timber
of
his
own
it
no
fair
that
a
christian
man
should
be
paid
for
the
lumber
he
plunders
from
other
folks
land
you
paid
him
for
that
of
course
o
no
replied
payson
he
did
bring
in
his
bill
for
that
he
had
cleared
and
fenced
the
piece
over
the
river
and
he
said
he
did
wish
to
lose
his
labor
well
said
jones
almost
fiercely
i
was
aware
elder
that
you
employed
him
to
do
that
little
job
i
thought
that
was
done
last
year
we
knew
anything
you
in
these
parts
yes
yes
said
the
missionary
coloring
and
i
rather
think
he
continued
that
he
got
his
pay
for
his
work
as
he
expected
to
in
what
he
took
from
the
land
i
never
saw
better
corn
and
wheat
let
alone
the
potatoes
and
the
pumpkins
that
he
raised
on
that
river
bottom
and
as
to
the
rails
they
belong
where
he
took
them
from
that
lot
that
he
robbed
and
impoverished
tilling
the
soil
in
the
summer
and
cutting
down
the
best
trees
in
the
winter
and
working
what
he
did
care
about
into
rails
and
now
he
turns
around
after
having
skimmed
your
milk
when
he
had
plenty
of
his
own
and
tells
you
as
a
christian
brother
that
you
orter
pay
him
for
taking
off
the
cream
and
making
butter
of
it
for
his
own
table
may
i
ask
what
he
charged
you
for
the
operation
he
asked
said
the
minister
eighty
dollars
but
concluded
to
take
thirty
and
when
you
form
your
church
you
choose
him
first
deacon
you
said
the
squatter
sneeringly
neighbor
jones
said
the
minister
quietly
i
find
that
character
is
pretty
well
understood
among
the
settlers
from
all
i
can
learn
i
judge
that
he
has
never
been
a
member
of
a
church
but
is
one
of
a
too
large
class
who
try
to
palm
themselves
off
on
religious
people
that
they
may
the
better
carry
out
their
own
wicked
and
selfish
ends
i
did
not
pay
him
the
thirty
dollars
because
he
had
a
right
to
ask
it
of
me
but
because
i
had
rather
sacrifice
something
than
to
expose
the
spiritual
welfare
of
this
people
by
giving
an
occasion
for
a
quarrel
however
unjustly
and
mark
me
the
time
will
come
when
that
money
small
as
the
amount
is
will
be
a
burden
to
the
conscience
of
that
man
but
he
added
suddenly
changing
the
subject
we
expect
to
have
a
raising
on
my
lot
day
after
can
not
i
rely
on
you
for
a
lift
ah
said
he
what
are
you
going
to
put
up
there
a
framed
house
o
no
replied
the
minister
smiling
only
a
few
logs
the
town
owners
are
going
to
let
me
take
down
the
log
house
they
have
used
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
as
the
logs
are
so
well
seasoned
and
put
them
up
on
my
place
and
wife
turning
to
her
we
shall
have
to
depend
on
you
for
refreshments
for
the
occasion
you
have
given
me
short
notice
she
replied
but
i
can
have
things
ready
if
you
can
manage
to
get
supplies
and
a
stove
up
in
season
if
you
want
a
little
help
in
getting
started
here
said
jones
i
send
up
my
tom
i
guess
he
like
to
lend
you
a
hand
could
he
come
asked
payson
i
send
him
right
along
said
the
squatter
as
he
bent
his
steps
towards
home
what
are
we
going
to
do
for
a
stove
asked
the
wife
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
sight
that
be
forthcoming
said
the
minister
tom
having
made
his
appearance
was
requested
by
payson
to
take
the
team
and
go
to
town
and
say
to
palmer
that
they
had
decided
to
move
into
the
cabin
and
would
like
to
get
settled
before
night
which
message
brought
palmer
back
with
tom
accompanied
by
a
containing
a
large
a
bag
of
flour
some
chairs
a
little
crockery
and
a
supply
of
various
eatables
and
by
nightfall
the
missionary
family
were
domiciled
in
the
frontier
cabin
and
the
next
morning
you
would
have
thought
the
missionary
wife
already
quite
with
her
neat
calico
and
tidy
apron
busy
in
her
preparations
for
the
i
do
mean
to
stay
in
a
borrowed
house
a
great
while
she
said
husband
how
soon
do
you
calculate
that
we
can
be
housekeeping
in
our
own
cabin
it
will
take
some
weeks
do
our
best
he
answered
well
she
rejoined
i
set
the
time
four
weeks
from
and
if
it
is
ready
then
i
shall
go
into
it
if
i
have
to
leave
you
behind
but
how
slowly
everything
dragged
except
the
raising
the
settlers
went
into
that
with
right
good
will
men
and
teams
were
busy
drawing
the
logs
while
experienced
hands
placed
them
properly
upon
each
other
till
the
crowned
the
whole
then
they
sat
down
on
the
grass
to
partake
of
the
tempting
eatables
that
tom
and
payson
had
brought
on
the
ground
there
were
the
light
biscuits
and
the
golden
butter
nice
venison
steaks
for
which
they
were
indebted
to
the
rifle
of
jones
dried
apple
turnovers
and
the
sheets
of
crisp
gingerbread
loaf
cake
and
fragrant
coffee
we
do
get
any
whiskey
at
this
raising
said
palmer
nudging
his
next
neighbor
no
he
replied
and
it
an
example
that
i
hope
will
be
often
followed
then
there
was
the
door
to
be
made
and
hung
and
the
windows
to
be
put
in
and
the
crevices
between
the
logs
to
be
mortared
and
the
floors
laid
long
and
tedious
operations
where
everybody
was
and
labor
could
be
hired
neither
for
love
nor
money
payson
found
that
much
of
the
work
had
to
be
done
by
himself
with
the
occasional
help
of
tom
he
was
and
his
bodily
strength
feeble
but
necessity
obliged
him
to
perform
prodigies
of
teaming
lifting
and
joinering
and
even
of
quarrying
stone
for
the
well
that
was
being
dug
a
few
weeks
had
wrought
a
wonderful
change
in
the
man
of
books
his
study
was
wherever
he
chanced
to
be
his
white
hands
had
become
horny
and
browned
his
pale
face
tanned
his
retiring
habits
had
given
place
to
a
broad
sociality
his
diffidence
to
a
generous
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
do
and
dare
almost
anything
from
early
morning
till
late
at
night
he
worked
to
get
his
log
home
ready
while
his
wife
and
little
ones
remained
in
the
solitary
cabin
by
the
riverside
it
was
a
long
walk
for
him
however
after
toiling
all
day
and
when
the
sky
was
overcast
at
nightfall
he
was
in
danger
of
getting
lost
this
gave
his
wife
much
uneasiness
then
she
feared
that
he
might
meet
some
prowling
wolf
or
other
beast
in
the
darkness
and
when
he
was
very
late
she
would
be
sure
to
think
he
was
lost
and
would
ring
her
which
consisted
of
a
tin
pan
on
which
she
would
drum
vigorously
with
the
she
said
he
would
recognize
that
sound
she
thought
at
a
great
distance
but
the
four
weeks
went
by
and
on
account
of
the
difficulty
of
getting
lumber
and
other
necessary
articles
the
roof
was
still
unshingled
and
the
floor
only
half
laid
the
wife
like
most
women
had
a
very
good
memory
for
dates
the
log
cabin
they
occupied
was
open
and
the
prairie
winds
cold
and
piercing
and
for
a
few
days
she
had
been
quite
ill
but
that
morning
after
her
unsuspicious
husband
had
left
for
his
joinering
tom
might
have
been
seen
guiding
a
yoke
of
cattle
attached
to
a
cart
into
the
enclosure
which
after
much
geeing
and
he
managed
to
make
stand
before
the
door
charlie
said
he
as
that
urchin
made
his
appearance
from
the
inside
of
the
cart
you
stand
by
the
cattle
while
i
put
the
things
aboard
and
bringing
out
a
barrel
filled
with
crockery
and
other
things
which
payson
had
clandestinely
packed
for
the
occasion
and
the
full
of
eatables
and
hanging
the
chairs
over
the
cart
stakes
he
took
down
the
bedsteads
and
placed
them
in
a
manner
that
was
highly
satisfactory
to
the
energetic
minister
wife
and
tying
up
the
in
great
bundles
deposited
them
also
and
saying
to
payson
i
shall
have
to
fix
an
easy
place
for
you
to
ride
as
you
been
sick
he
laid
the
hard
beds
in
the
empty
space
which
he
had
left
for
that
purpose
in
the
cart
with
the
feather
beds
above
saying
there
you
wo
feel
the
motion
much
now
and
assisting
her
to
mount
she
was
enthroned
on
her
downy
seat
on
the
top
of
the
load
with
the
children
in
high
glee
by
her
side
the
steers
which
were
notoriously
unruly
as
if
aware
that
they
had
a
minister
wife
aboard
behaved
with
becoming
decorum
under
tom
wise
supervision
now
it
chanced
that
some
careless
hunter
firing
into
the
dry
prairie
grass
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
had
started
a
fire
payson
had
noticed
in
the
morning
that
there
was
a
smell
of
burning
in
the
air
and
a
hazy
appearance
but
had
attached
no
particular
importance
to
it
but
as
they
approached
the
town
a
scene
of
great
magnificence
burst
upon
her
the
fires
driven
with
velocity
before
the
wind
had
swept
over
the
prairies
and
reached
the
belt
of
woods
in
a
portion
of
which
were
the
eighty
acres
that
her
husband
was
at
work
upon
the
flames
were
crackling
and
roaring
in
the
forests
burning
up
the
dry
underbrush
shooting
to
the
tops
of
the
old
dead
pines
so
that
the
scene
being
constantly
on
her
left
was
more
or
less
in
view
for
most
of
the
distance
what
shall
we
do
asked
tom
in
alarm
had
we
better
go
back
do
you
think
the
fire
has
reached
my
husband
claim
she
answered
tom
scanned
the
appearance
of
the
smoke
with
a
practised
eye
and
at
length
replied
no
it
not
got
as
far
as
there
yet
do
you
think
it
will
she
inquired
anxiously
if
the
wind
does
not
change
it
must
before
a
great
while
he
said
although
it
will
have
to
cross
the
road
which
will
backen
it
some
would
it
burn
up
the
cabin
then
she
inquired
i
am
afraid
it
would
he
answered
well
said
she
firmly
i
said
i
would
go
into
that
cabin
in
four
weeks
and
if
it
not
burnt
down
i
shall
keep
my
word
at
any
rate
we
shall
be
in
season
to
see
the
fire
then
she
added
looking
grave
i
do
hope
if
it
is
the
lord
will
that
the
fire
will
be
checked
in
time
my
husband
has
toiled
so
hard
as
the
cart
turned
up
the
main
street
of
the
town
she
caught
sight
of
the
cabin
that
was
to
be
her
future
home
and
she
saw
her
husband
too
at
the
same
moment
for
there
he
sat
on
the
roof
gazing
at
the
fire
which
seemed
to
be
dying
out
he
heard
the
rumbling
of
the
wheels
as
they
drew
near
and
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
object
approaching
he
called
out
why
what
under
the
canopy
have
we
here
wife
and
babies
and
household
effects
what
does
this
mean
you
are
not
going
to
emigrate
farther
west
are
you
if
you
from
your
elevated
position
she
replied
cheerily
i
to
inform
you
now
she
added
you
know
i
told
you
husband
i
should
move
into
the
cabin
and
did
you
ever
know
me
to
break
my
word
but
said
he
looking
disconcerted
i
not
ready
for
you
yet
the
floor
is
half
laid
well
she
replied
i
ca
stand
it
to
have
you
sweating
up
here
all
alone
at
your
task
running
the
risk
of
being
devoured
by
the
wolves
or
losing
your
way
at
night
because
you
think
the
cabin
comfortable
enough
for
me
why
you
are
as
particular
about
having
everything
done
just
so
about
this
cabin
as
you
used
to
be
east
in
having
every
word
exactly
in
its
place
when
you
wrote
your
sermons
please
now
just
help
tom
unload
and
set
these
things
in
and
have
tea
ready
directly
and
we
be
where
we
can
cheer
you
a
bit
but
what
about
this
fire
our
cabin
has
had
a
very
narrow
escape
yes
said
tom
coming
up
i
been
out
to
look
and
the
fire
just
came
up
to
your
line
and
then
stopped
payson
was
deeply
affected
by
the
intelligence
for
knowing
that
no
human
power
could
stay
the
advancing
flames
upon
the
cabin
top
he
had
been
praying
that
the
wind
might
change
was
it
in
answer
to
his
silent
petitions
that
it
had
taken
place
in
so
timely
a
manner
chapter
xi
old
skinflint
in
lost
in
the
woods
there
is
no
man
so
bad
as
he
might
be
a
fact
that
everybody
knows
but
that
most
are
apt
to
forget
in
their
estimate
of
those
who
have
offended
their
sense
of
right
smith
had
his
virtues
as
well
as
faults
perhaps
more
of
the
latter
than
the
former
but
there
were
some
mollifying
circumstances
to
be
taken
into
the
account
in
the
summing
up
of
his
character
his
natural
love
of
money
had
been
stimulated
and
intensified
by
the
malign
influence
of
his
wife
she
was
miserly
when
he
married
her
to
keep
what
she
had
and
get
what
she
could
was
her
ruling
passion
besides
which
she
had
a
passion
ruling
and
often
when
her
husband
gentler
heart
would
be
touched
by
a
tale
of
suffering
and
his
hand
be
opened
to
relieve
the
distressed
would
she
interfere
to
prevent
the
indulgence
of
the
benevolent
impulse
and
now
after
some
thirty
years
matrimonial
moulding
he
had
become
so
assimilated
to
her
grasping
spirit
and
so
accustomed
to
yield
to
her
stronger
will
that
his
dealings
in
business
made
him
appear
worse
than
he
really
was
in
the
sale
of
the
lot
to
the
missionary
about
which
much
indignation
was
felt
in
the
settlement
smith
was
the
chief
actor
smith
was
the
monkey
employed
to
pull
the
chestnuts
out
of
the
fire
although
it
must
be
confessed
he
relished
the
chestnuts
she
was
a
crafty
woman
and
kept
out
of
sight
in
the
transaction
while
she
urged
him
on
so
that
people
saw
only
smith
in
the
when
if
they
could
have
peeped
behind
the
curtain
they
would
have
seen
that
his
better
half
was
the
more
guilty
the
thirty
dollars
which
smith
finally
consented
to
take
for
the
improvements
on
the
claim
payson
was
unable
to
pay
all
at
once
he
was
therefore
subjected
to
many
vexatious
duns
for
the
balance
fearing
that
at
last
her
husband
would
relent
and
the
debt
might
not
all
be
realized
smith
resolved
to
turn
collector
herself
so
putting
on
her
best
cap
and
her
faded
black
alpaca
she
made
her
way
through
the
woods
to
the
missionary
cabin
when
she
reached
it
she
found
no
one
but
tom
and
bub
within
for
lincoln
had
called
with
his
team
and
taken
the
family
to
dine
at
his
house
is
the
minister
to
home
she
asked
no
replied
tom
when
will
he
be
back
i
do
know
said
tom
but
he
expects
to
attend
a
wedding
this
evening
and
as
it
now
four
i
expect
him
every
minute
then
said
she
i
guess
i
take
a
chair
and
wait
my
husband
has
a
small
bill
agin
him
and
i
thought
maybe
he
just
as
lief
pay
it
now
as
any
time
she
was
garrulous
and
inquisitive
plying
tom
with
all
sorts
of
questions
about
the
minister
family
much
to
the
annoyance
of
the
lad
who
remembering
that
there
were
certain
errands
yet
to
be
done
that
afternoon
for
tom
was
now
often
at
the
cabin
assisting
the
minister
he
asked
her
if
she
would
look
after
bub
while
he
went
to
the
village
saying
he
thought
it
likely
the
family
would
return
before
he
did
the
old
lady
rather
liked
the
arrangement
as
it
would
give
her
a
chance
to
inspect
the
housekeeping
of
the
minister
wife
and
watching
tom
till
he
was
well
into
town
she
commenced
her
examinations
first
she
opened
the
closet
door
to
see
how
the
dishes
were
arranged
for
she
had
heard
that
once
on
a
time
the
good
lady
had
committed
the
great
crime
of
writing
a
book
and
she
had
often
remarked
that
anybody
that
could
waste
their
time
in
sich
a
way
must
be
a
master
slack
housekeeper
to
her
disappointment
however
she
found
that
quite
as
good
order
and
rather
more
taste
reigned
there
than
in
her
own
pantry
but
was
relieved
again
a
moment
at
finding
an
unwashed
plate
just
as
i
thought
she
muttered
with
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
having
finished
her
leisurely
inspection
of
the
cupboard
during
which
she
smelled
of
the
bread
to
see
if
it
was
sour
broke
off
a
bit
of
the
cake
to
see
if
it
was
extravagant
and
sucked
some
plum
sauce
from
the
ends
of
her
fingers
she
started
to
peer
under
the
bed
to
ascertain
if
there
was
any
dust
there
when
hearing
a
noise
supposing
that
the
minister
had
come
she
turned
and
closed
the
closet
door
and
reseated
herself
wiping
her
mouth
with
her
apron
as
she
did
so
this
change
of
posture
brought
her
into
full
view
of
the
stairs
leading
to
the
loft
above
which
humble
place
under
the
roof
the
clergyman
used
for
a
study
when
he
wished
to
be
retired
on
the
stairs
descending
with
solemn
step
and
slow
was
bub
with
the
minister
old
hat
on
which
he
kept
above
his
eyes
by
one
chubby
hand
and
the
minister
glasses
resting
on
his
nose
and
the
good
trailing
magnificently
behind
bub
manner
showed
that
he
felt
his
consequence
much
increased
by
his
clerical
outfit
and
the
benignant
gravity
of
his
face
was
edifying
to
behold
goodness
gracious
exclaimed
the
old
lady
what
on
airth
you
up
to
you
imp
o
satan
ca
you
berhave
in
the
minister
house
and
seizing
the
urchin
as
he
landed
she
only
ceased
shaking
him
as
the
spectacles
dropped
to
the
floor
this
reception
was
wholly
unexpected
to
poor
bub
and
as
she
relieved
him
of
his
ministerial
vestments
he
sobbed
indignantly
now
bub
go
wite
away
and
never
come
back
no
more
and
opening
the
door
he
marched
resolutely
out
the
elderly
caller
had
now
the
congenial
duty
to
do
of
restoring
the
minister
apparel
to
its
proper
place
overhead
and
glancing
out
of
the
window
to
be
sure
nobody
was
coming
she
ascended
to
the
missionary
now
rev
payson
in
his
varied
pursuits
of
preacher
pastor
farmer
and
doctor
for
having
skill
in
medicine
the
sick
depended
somewhat
on
his
medical
care
he
was
quite
apt
to
leave
his
uninviting
study
in
disorder
especially
when
suddenly
called
from
home
moreover
like
the
other
cabins
in
a
new
country
the
house
was
overrun
with
field
mice
making
it
as
payson
sometimes
said
dangerous
to
sleep
with
one
mouth
open
lest
a
mouse
might
mistake
it
for
his
hole
and
pop
in
whether
however
such
a
suffocating
casualty
would
occur
or
not
the
wee
animals
chased
each
other
along
the
logs
ransacked
the
closet
scampered
across
the
beds
nibbling
at
everything
that
tempted
their
sharp
little
teeth
even
the
clergyman
books
and
papers
were
mutilated
by
them
most
irreverently
the
sight
of
the
sheets
and
bits
of
writing
paper
the
news
journals
and
old
reviews
for
the
missionary
unable
to
take
the
current
publications
read
and
the
old
ones
with
a
mournful
satisfaction
and
the
other
signs
of
confusion
which
prevailed
and
which
so
annoyed
his
wife
were
as
refreshing
to
smith
eyes
as
the
first
glimpse
of
land
to
columbus
zactly
as
i
expected
she
ejaculated
lifting
her
hands
in
horror
i
alluz
hearn
tell
that
these
ere
women
are
a
shiftless
set
i
should
think
it
would
worry
a
man
life
out
of
his
body
to
be
jined
to
sich
a
hussy
why
there
my
betsy
ann
she
ken
go
a
visitin
more
half
the
time
and
her
husband
never
said
boo
agin
her
an
i

o
women
what
could
embroider
an
play

an

off
but
duzz

i
should
think
it
would
make

if
he

all
that
in
them
volums
an
they
do
say
larned
well
i
must
stay
here
no
longer
though
it
jist
as
i
expected
and
returning
to
the
room
below
she
lifted
her
hands
again
in
astonishment
as
she
saw
by
the
clock
that
it
was
five
i
guess
john
have
to
git
his
own
fodder
or
go
without
used
to
it
though
i
brings
my
man
up
not
to
expect
a
woman
to
drudge
drudge
about
house
but
mercy
me
she
exclaimed
that
child
gone
to
i
warrant
he
in
some
mischief
and
opening
the
door
she
called
bub
bub
come
inter
the
huss
but
bub
did
not
answer
so
she
went
around
the
cabin
but
could
see
nothing
of
him
and
thinking
that
he
would
not
come
because
it
was
she
that
called
him
she
added
come
right
in
now
tom
wants
yer
there
was
only
a
slight
clearing
around
the
cabin
and
then
came
a
thick
growth
of
bushes
and
beyond
the
woods
on
either
hand
save
the
path
in
the
direction
of
the
town
it
was
but
a
few
rods
to
the
nearest
house
in
the
village
and
she
hurried
there
to
make
inquiries
for
she
was
becoming
anxious
for
the
child
but
the
children
playing
near
by
said
that
bub
had
not
passed
that
way
so
running
back
she
instituted
a
new
search
in
the
vicinity
of
the
cabin
calling
him
as
before
and
receiving
no
answer
and
as
there
was
a
wide
cart
track
leading
into
the
woods
from
the
cabin
door
thinking
it
natural
for
the
child
to
stray
that
way
she
hastened
in
that
direction
we
have
said
that
smith
had
his
virtues
as
well
as
weaknesses
and
of
course
his
wife
was
not
depraved
in
the
sense
in
which
that
term
is
intended
by
those
who
hold
that
man
is
naturally
sinful
and
as
she
had
borne
children
a
motherly
solicitude
was
now
awakened
in
her
heart
for
bub
and
she
pressed
anxiously
down
the
path
while
the
deepening
twilight
steadily
increased
the
gloom
that
lingered
in
the
shadows
of
the
lofty
trees
the
cart
track
grew
less
distinct
as
she
advanced
and
as
she
had
not
found
bub
she
concluded
to
return
and
alarm
the
neighbors
but
found
her
course
impeded
on
every
side
by
the
thick
underbrush
for
she
had
lost
the
main
path
with
desperate
efforts
she
pushed
aside
the
boughs
and
struck
once
more
the
cart
track
as
she
supposed
but
alas
for
her
she
was
mistaken
her
head
had
become
bewildered
and
she
was
penetrating
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
on
on
she
urged
her
steps
wondering
that
she
did
not
come
in
sight
of
the
minister
cabin
when
to
her
delight
she
heard
a
sound
like
the
crying
of
a
child
now
a
heavy
load
was
lifted
from
her
mind
i
must
be
nearing
the
cabin
thought
she
and
that
bub
and
she
called
with
unusual
tenderness
bub
bub
where
are
you
she
listened
intently
expecting
a
response
and
heard
again
the
same
sound
but
strangely
farther
off
so
she
quickened
her
speed
calling
the
boy
with
renewed
vigor
wearied
at
last
in
her
fruitless
endeavors
she
stopped
to
rest
a
moment
and
collect
her
scattered
faculties
she
was
an
apt
calculator
in
money
matters
and
that
faculty
summoned
into
exercise
now
convinced
her
that
she
had
passed
over
many
times
the
distance
needed
had
she
been
going
in
the
right
direction
and
the
horrible
conclusion
that
she
was
lost
in
the
woods
thrilled
her
with
terror
she
recollected
also
that
there
had
been
stories
told
of
late
of
a
panther
voice
being
heard
in
those
woods
and
that
it
sounded
like
the
crying
of
a
child
this
increased
her
fear
while
she
was
considering
what
to
do
in
her
extremity
a
short
quick
bark
far
in
the
forest
behind
her
succeeded
by
a
prolonged
howl
the
bloodthirsty
cry
of
the
timber
wolf
which
when
once
heard
can
never
be
forgotten
broke
on
her
ear
she
had
lived
too
long
in
the
wilderness
not
to
know
what
that
meant
and
she
fled
with
wondrous
swiftness
down
the
path
on
on
she
knew
not
whither
her
trembling
limbs
began
to
fail
but
again
the
fiendish
resounded
succeeded
by
that
of
another
and
yet
another
showing
that
the
call
of
the
first
had
brought
others
to
the
chase
made
her
forget
her
weakness
and
like
a
spirit
away
she
sped
once
more
on
the
race
for
life
the
race
however
was
an
unequal
one
and
its
fearful
termination
was
soon
staring
her
in
the
face
as
she
heard
the
ferocious
creatures
drawing
near
when
to
her
relief
she
saw
ahead
a
small
untenanted
cabin
it
was
a
shanty
used
by
the
woodsmen
in
the
winter
while
felling
trees
the
door
was
off
its
hinges
and
passing
swiftly
in
in
the
agony
of
despair
she
glanced
around
for
a
but
the
room
was
equally
open
to
the
wolves
as
to
herself
instantly
in
a
manner
that
seemed
almost
superhuman
she
passed
up
the
side
of
the
cabin
to
a
beam
laid
for
an
upper
floor
and
stood
there
clinging
with
her
bony
fingers
to
the
wall
as
motionless
as
a
marble
statue
while
the
wolves
disappointed
of
their
prey
sat
on
the
floor
below
lapping
their
hungry
jaws
and
watching
her
till
dawn
where
she
was
found
by
a
party
who
had
been
searching
for
her
all
night
she
was
speechless
when
rescued
and
utterly
unable
for
a
time
to
give
any
account
of
herself
her
first
inquiry
however
when
she
could
remember
what
had
happened
was
for
little
bub
i
guess
said
one
of
the
men
soothingly
he
has
turned
up
all
right
afore
now
but
as
she
insisted
on
going
to
the
minister
to
ascertain
if
bub
was
safe
they
assisted
her
there
where
were
assembled
a
number
of
women
among
whom
was
jones
anxious
about
the
lost
child
for
no
trace
of
him
had
been
discovered
when
bub
was
so
unceremoniously
disrobed
of
his
priestly
garments
by
smith
skinny
hand
highly
offended
at
so
gross
an
invasion
of
his
rights
and
dignities
to
console
himself
he
determined
to
run
home
and
tell
his
mother
of
the
outrage
now
the
make
of
the
land
back
of
the
missionary
cabin
was
much
like
that
near
his
father
and
therefore
he
took
his
way
in
that
direction
instead
of
the
one
smith
had
surmised
he
had
taken
quite
a
walk
when
he
saw
the
stream
that
divided
the
minister
lot
remembering
that
there
was
a
river
back
of
his
mother
cabin
he
concluded
that
his
home
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
before
him
the
cornstalks
too
left
standing
in
the
cleared
ground
opposite
were
in
sight
and
they
resembled
the
corn
that
tom
had
cut
and
stacked
so
he
trudged
up
and
down
the
bank
to
find
a
way
to
cross
till
he
came
to
a
tree
which
had
been
felled
for
that
purpose
and
constituted
the
only
bridge
the
topmost
boughs
of
which
rested
on
the
other
side
just
as
the
stream
was
bridged
below
his
cabin
but
upon
which
he
had
often
been
charged
not
to
venture
bub
had
been
so
often
charged
on
this
point
and
impressed
with
the
danger
that
he
did
not
forget
it
now
and
while
he
amused
himself
with
dropping
sticks
into
the
water
and
watching
to
see
them
carried
along
by
the
current
he
called
mother
come
get
bub
if
you
do
want
him
drownded
up
and
as
his
mother
did
not
make
her
appearance
he
shouted
for
sarah
till
as
it
was
getting
dusk
he
felt
afraid
to
linger
longer
and
mounted
the
tree
it
was
a
dizzy
height
above
the
water
and
curly
pate
would
whirl
whenever
he
glanced
below
so
as
he
could
not
walk
steadily
he
sat
down
and
tried
to
hitch
along
as
he
had
seen
sarah
do
this
was
not
much
better
for
him
and
he
began
creeping
on
all
fours
and
with
many
an
admonitory
slip
which
served
to
make
him
the
more
careful
he
had
got
nearly
across
when
he
fell
holding
his
breath
from
fright
fortunately
however
he
had
reached
the
lower
limbs
and
the
friendly
branches
held
him
until
he
was
able
to
regain
the
trunk
of
the
tree
and
ere
long
his
little
feet
pressed
the
cultivated
ground
was
not
fenced
next
the
river
the
bank
being
sufficiently
steep
to
keep
out
stray
cattle
and
bub
found
some
difficulty
in
scaling
it
but
as
he
was
hungry
for
supper
and
had
something
of
a
will
of
his
own
despite
his
short
legs
and
frequent
tumbles
at
last
he
succeeded
and
wandering
around
in
the
cornfield
vainly
seeking
his
mother
cabin
baffled
in
his
efforts
and
finding
that
crying
was
of
no
avail
tired
frightened
and
dispirited
he
leaned
his
head
against
a
clump
of
cornstalks
and
falling
gently
from
the
support
to
the
soft
soil
he
dropped
asleep
as
the
darkness
came
on
but
where
was
tom
when
he
returned
from
doing
the
errands
he
was
surprised
at
not
finding
either
smith
or
bub
at
the
minister
and
was
standing
undecided
what
to
do
when
the
clergyman
drove
up
tom
immediately
stated
his
perplexity
you
do
suppose
the
woman
went
home
leaving
bub
here
alone
and
the
child
has
strayed
away
suggested
payson
apprehensively
i
scarcely
think
a
woman
of
her
age
would
be
so
imprudent
replied
her
husband
she
may
however
have
gone
to
the
village
and
taken
the
child
with
her
for
safe
keeping
it
would
be
well
tom
to
go
down
and
see
tom
was
hurrying
along
when
a
lad
called
out
did
the
old
woman
find
bub
and
he
related
how
she
came
there
in
search
of
him
this
startled
tom
and
hastening
back
he
told
payson
what
he
had
heard
perhaps
then
said
the
minister
the
old
lady
got
tired
of
waiting
for
me
and
took
bub
home
with
her
you
may
take
the
team
and
ride
over
there
finding
that
smith
had
not
seen
his
wife
tom
at
once
concluded
that
there
must
be
something
seriously
wrong
and
he
said
i
was
told
at
the
village
that
your
wife
was
there
trying
to
find
bub
it
may
be
they
are
both
lost
in
the
woods
now
if
you
will
get
the
settlers
about
here
together
i
will
rouse
the
villagers
and
we
will
make
a
search
we
have
already
described
the
finding
of
the
lost
woman
the
ground
on
the
side
of
the
river
next
to
the
minister
cabin
had
been
looked
over
repeatedly
and
no
one
seemed
to
think
it
possible
that
the
child
had
crossed
the
river
and
the
conclusion
came
to
be
general
that
he
had
either
been
carried
off
by
a
wild
beast
or
fallen
into
the
water
and
been
drowned
and
preparations
were
made
for
dragging
the
stream
for
the
body
when
one
of
the
party
saw
a
bit
of
cloth
which
tom
recognized
as
torn
from
bub
dress
flaunting
from
a
twig
on
the
he
must
be
on
the
other
side
cried
tom
and
with
new
hope
the
party
rushed
to
explore
the
field
shouting
his
name
here
i
be
answered
a
childish
voice
and
they
found
him
seated
on
the
ground
composedly
picking
the
kernels
from
an
ear
of
corn
the
channels
which
the
tears
had
ploughed
on
his
unwashed
cheeks
being
the
only
evidence
of
the
sorrows
through
which
he
had
passed
and
he
said
with
the
air
of
one
whose
feelings
had
been
wounded
by
undeserved
neglect
i
has
had
any
dinner
some
theologians
tell
us
that
the
sinful
should
never
be
addressed
through
their
fears
that
love
can
only
reform
the
erring
perhaps
smith
was
unlike
the
rest
of
the
race
but
the
terrors
of
that
night
wrought
a
change
in
her
and
payson
was
surprised
one
day
by
smith
calling
at
his
cabin
with
a
fine
quarter
of
beef
saying
as
he
lugged
it
in
i
been
killing
an
ox
elder
and
wife
thought
if
you
would
be
offended
that
i
better
bring
you
down
a
piece
adding
as
he
rose
to
go
here
that
that
you
gave
me
for
the
improvements
on
the
ten
acres
wife
says
you
paid
enough
on
it
so
i
receipted
it
and
will
call
it
square
if
you
will
and
by
the
way
when
you
are
out
of
butter
just
send
over
to
our
house
we
can
spare
you
a
few
pounds
now
and
then
just
as
well
as
not
chapter
xii
fire
and
flood
the
sum
which
had
been
pledged
by
the
settlers
was
not
sufficient
for
the
support
of
the
missionary
family
and
although
the
treasurer
exerted
himself
to
the
utmost
he
could
only
collect
a
portion
of
what
was
due
from
those
whose
names
were
on
the
subscription
paper
no
one
felt
the
inconvenience
of
this
more
than
the
clergyman
wife
she
was
a
good
manager
and
had
a
wonderful
faculty
for
making
one
dollar
go
as
far
as
three
and
getting
up
meals
out
of
nothing
as
her
husband
often
remarked
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
with
the
keen
appetites
brought
to
them
on
the
wings
of
the
prairie
winds
the
little
household
sometimes
rose
from
the
table
hungry
for
more
payson
under
these
circumstances
would
comfort
her
with
anticipations
of
future
abundance
they
knew
indeed
that
most
of
the
settlers
had
newly
arrived
and
had
everything
to
buy
as
they
had
not
been
long
enough
settled
to
raise
anything
from
the
ground
but
a
year
had
now
elapsed
and
many
acres
of
the
rich
soil
had
been
turned
over
and
planted
and
there
was
prospect
of
abundant
returns
the
missionary
being
unaccustomed
to
farming
and
wishing
to
devote
his
energies
as
far
as
practicable
to
the
spiritual
interests
of
his
growing
charge
had
let
out
his
tillable
lot
to
a
neighbor
to
be
cultivated
on
shares
reserving
a
little
spot
for
himself
which
he
had
planted
to
early
potatoes
and
a
good
variety
of
garden
vegetables
as
the
one
who
carried
on
the
rest
of
the
piece
was
an
intelligent
and
experienced
farmer
and
had
facilities
for
the
work
in
the
way
of
teams
and
men
the
clergyman
felt
that
he
might
reasonably
calculate
on
a
supply
of
corn
and
wheat
to
which
crops
the
ground
had
been
devoted
and
nowhere
was
there
promise
of
a
larger
yield
than
on
that
quick
and
productive
river
bottom
the
corn
grew
to
a
prodigious
height
crowded
with
mammoth
ears
and
the
wheat
emulated
the
corn
while
the
squash
and
pumpkin
vines
conducted
as
if
on
a
race
to
see
which
would
beat
in
the
number
and
size
of
their
fruit
and
payson
pet
sorghum
a
species
of
shot
up
to
a
marvellous
perfection
it
is
true
that
a
neighbor
unruly
cattle
had
broken
into
the
enclosure
a
number
of
times
and
a
contrary
sow
with
her
lively
family
of
eleven
had
also
made
sundry
plundering
raids
causing
the
minister
considerable
trouble
in
driving
and
keeping
out
the
intruders
but
he
had
already
a
fine
supply
of
seasoned
oak
rails
under
way
for
perfecting
the
fences
and
he
cheerily
said
to
his
wife
another
year
and
i
defy
the
unruliest
animals
in
the
settlement
to
steal
an
ear
of
corn
or
a
potato
from
my
lot
summer
had
now
faded
into
late
autumn
and
one
day
the
farmer
who
had
charge
of
the
field
called
at
payson
looking
very
dejected
elder
said
he
our
farming
this
year
is
going
to
be
losing
business
why
what
the
matter
asked
the
clergyman
you
see
he
replied
most
of
the
settlers
like
myself
came
from
a
warmer
climate
than
this
we
were
told
also
that
the
growing
season
was
as
long
here
as
there
and
brought
our
choicest
seed
with
us
but
there
is
not
time
for
it
to
ripen
and
our
corn
will
not
do
to
grind
nor
will
it
keep
it
is
so
green
it
is
a
great
disappointment
to
me
but
most
of
the
neighbors
are
in
the
same
situation
words
can
not
describe
what
sad
tidings
these
were
to
the
missionary
the
wheat
is
good
is
it
not
he
inquired
yes
but
you
know
there
was
little
sown
as
the
ground
was
best
adapted
to
corn
so
it
turned
out
that
more
was
realized
from
the
half
acre
cultivated
by
the
missionary
notwithstanding
the
old
farmer
laughed
at
his
city
style
of
doing
things
than
from
the
nine
and
a
half
acres
besides
and
the
year
of
plenty
had
to
be
deferred
for
another
twelvemonth
that
eighty
acres
how
much
comfort
the
missionary
and
his
wife
took
in
the
thought
that
it
was
or
rather
soon
would
be
theirs
how
many
times
they
admired
its
pleasant
rolling
aspect
and
weighed
its
prospective
value
and
the
pretty
grove
near
the
cabin
with
its
trees
what
cosy
walks
they
had
with
the
children
in
its
leafy
shade
what
enjoyment
in
noting
the
progress
made
in
clearing
out
the
underbrush
and
trimming
the
trees
of
superfluous
branches
if
the
place
was
only
paid
for
said
the
husband
one
day
i
should
be
glad
let
me
see
eighty
acres
at
one
dollar
and
cents
an
acre
the
government
price
would
be
one
hundred
dollars
i
think
i
act
upon
jones
suggestion
and
sell
some
of
the
timber
across
the
river
and
immediately
i
have
been
offered
thirty
dollars
an
acre
for
the
privilege
of
cutting
off
the
wood
and
at
that
rate
three
and
a
half
acres
would
be
more
than
enough
so
the
sale
was
effected
and
with
the
hundred
dollars
in
his
pocket
the
clergyman
started
one
morning
on
horseback
for
the
land
office
miles
distant
a
horseback
ride
across
a
minnesota
prairie
is
highly
exhilarating
and
both
horse
and
rider
were
in
good
spirits
seemingly
half
borne
on
by
a
sweeping
prairie
wind
payson
reached
his
destination
in
some
five
hours
in
season
for
an
early
tea
and
the
next
morning
he
was
conducted
to
the
land
office
by
a
lawyer
acquaintance
and
with
a
witness
at
hand
to
prove
what
he
affirmed
stated
under
oath
that
he
had
on
the
land
he
wished
to
a
cabin
and
other
improvements
to
the
amount
that
the
law
required
and
then
having
paid
his
hundred
dollars
he
started
towards
home
with
a
light
heart
the
day
became
dark
and
cloudy
and
as
there
was
only
a
faint
cart
track
across
the
prairies
the
minister
found
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
that
he
had
lost
his
way
there
were
no
cabins
at
which
he
could
retrieve
his
error
and
after
many
vain
endeavors
to
find
the
track
he
let
his
horse
take
his
own
course
and
carrying
his
master
under
trees
and
through
thorny
thickets
across
a
swamp
he
brought
him
out
at
last
by
a
much
shorter
route
than
he
had
taken
in
going
on
the
farther
bank
of
the
river
near
the
town
as
the
clergyman
neared
the
village
he
noticed
heavy
volumes
of
smoke
ascending
then
he
saw
palmer
with
a
force
of
men
busily
engaged
in
checking
a
fire
that
was
careering
through
the
bushes
there
was
a
wall
of
flame
between
him
and
them
striking
the
road
he
dashed
through
the
glowing
boundary
and
palmer
beckoning
to
him
said
we
have
rather
bad
news
to
tell
you
though
not
so
bad
as
it
might
have
been
a
fire
commenced
near
your
place
yesterday
afternoon
and
came
near
burning
the
town
a
fire
there
ejaculated
the
minister
how
did
it
start
i
can
not
stop
to
tell
you
said
his
bachelor
friend
but
your
wife
when
you
get
home
will
tell
you
all
about
it
had
it
not
been
for
her
we
should
have
been
swept
away
what
a
sight
met
the
clergyman
eye
as
he
came
into
the
town
the
entire
area
before
so
like
a
lawn
looked
as
if
the
contents
of
a
large
had
been
spread
over
it
he
was
relieved
however
to
see
that
his
cabin
and
the
other
houses
were
still
standing
but
his
wife
met
him
with
a
depressed
bearing
quite
in
contrast
to
her
usual
sprightly
manner
it
so
struck
to
his
heart
to
see
how
badly
she
felt
that
although
his
glance
from
the
saddle
showed
that
the
flames
had
not
spared
his
beloved
grove
and
had
consumed
the
rails
of
which
he
had
been
so
proud
and
spoiled
many
a
promising
tree
with
a
desperate
endeavor
he
set
about
comforting
her
o
this
is
nothing
said
he
nothing
at
all
consider
what
it
would
have
been
had
the
cabin
taken
fire
and
you
and
the
children
been
in
danger
which
would
have
been
the
case
she
added
had
not
our
town
owner
caswell
come
to
the
rescue
with
his
usual
energy
at
the
head
of
a
force
of
men
and
teams
bringing
with
them
hogsheads
of
water
and
pails
with
which
to
throw
it
upon
the
fire
you
have
reason
to
thank
them
for
they
worked
as
i
never
saw
men
work
before
but
how
did
the
fire
commence
he
asked
why
you
see
said
she
after
you
left
i
said
to
the
children
gone
to
the
land
office
to
buy
the
land
and
now
we
stir
around
and
see
how
nice
we
can
make
everything
look
by
the
time
he
gets
back
well
you
know
how
unsightly
the
chips
looked
around
the
house
and
which
you
had
not
had
time
to
remove
so
we
went
to
work
raking
them
up
into
little
heaps
while
we
were
thus
employed
we
heard
the
report
of
a
gun
in
the
bushes
near
by
the
morning
you
recollect
was
quite
calm
but
just
as
the
gun
was
fired
a
gust
of
wind
swept
over
the
place
carrying
with
it
some
burning
wadding
that
alighted
in
a
dry
log
some
rods
away
before
i
could
get
there
the
inflammable
wood
was
afire
and
from
that
other
sparks
had
been
borne
on
and
at
once
had
kindled
flames
in
a
number
of
different
places
seeing
that
it
was
impossible
to
arrest
the
progress
of
the
conflagration
i
sent
helen
to
the
nearest
neighbor
to
give
the
alarm
and
as
i
have
already
said
by
the
help
of
those
that
came
our
cabin
was
barely
saved
and
the
neighbors
had
to
fight
hard
to
preserve
their
own
dwellings
each
day
after
that
the
missionary
would
walk
about
his
blackened
domain
pondering
the
uncertainty
of
all
sublunary
things
about
which
he
had
so
often
preached
his
wife
scrutinizing
his
disconsolate
face
the
while
and
he
repeating
with
an
emphasis
that
showed
he
was
saying
it
for
his
own
benefit
as
much
as
hers
o
it
nothing
at
all
nothing
at
all
and
as
for
those
few
rails
as
he
kicked
over
the
burnt
fragments
with
a
melancholy
look
they
not
of
much
account
for
the
piece
over
the
river
is
pretty
well
fenced
after
all
luckily
the
fires
did
touch
them
and
we
have
them
safe
for
another
year
one
afternoon
a
few
days
later
as
payson
was
in
his
attic
study
absorbed
an
unwonted
darkness
fell
upon
the
page
before
him
then
a
heavy
peal
of
thunder
succeeded
it
was
one
long
continuous
roll
for
an
hour
or
more
without
pause
and
the
rain
poured
down
as
he
never
saw
it
in
any
shower
east
it
seemed
as
if
the
heavy
clouds
were
literally
emptying
their
contents
upon
prairie
and
forest
while
flash
followed
flash
of
vivid
lightning
throughout
the
whole
night
it
rained
and
the
next
day
and
the
next
and
were
it
not
for
the
ancient
promise
one
might
have
thought
that
a
second
flood
was
to
sweep
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
away
about
midnight
of
the
third
day
of
the
terrible
storm
the
family
at
the
missionary
cabin
were
awakened
by
wild
shoutings
in
the
village
below
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
matter
asked
payson
nothing
serious
i
think
said
her
husband
as
the
town
site
is
rolling
and
descends
towards
the
river
it
is
probable
that
the
high
water
has
come
up
into
some
of
the
yards
and
gardens
and
perhaps
has
invaded
some
of
the
settlers
and
and
the
neighbors
are
working
in
the
rain
and
darkness
to
save
their
live
stock
the
sun
came
out
next
morning
like
a
from
out
his
chamber
rejoicing
as
a
strong
man
to
run
his
race
flooding
the
fields
with
light
as
the
clouds
had
flooded
them
with
water
revealing
the
destruction
which
the
tempest
had
caused
it
appeared
that
the
river
a
short
distance
up
stream
from
the
town
had
become
obstructed
by
dead
trees
and
brush
and
loosened
soil
until
a
heavy
body
of
water
had
accumulated
when
the
impediment
suddenly
giving
way
the
water
rushed
with
tremendous
power
inundating
a
wide
extent
of
ground
and
sweeping
away
everything
movable
in
its
path
many
cabins
were
flooded
sleepers
being
awakened
by
the
water
dashing
against
their
beds
while
articles
of
furniture
were
floating
about
in
the
room
it
was
this
that
caused
the
outcries
that
payson
had
heard
the
jones
cabin
had
been
well
chosen
for
safety
on
ordinary
occasions
but
on
the
night
in
question
tom
was
awakened
by
something
cold
touching
his
hand
for
in
throwing
it
out
of
bed
in
his
sleep
it
had
been
immersed
in
the
water
which
had
entered
the
room
and
was
rapidly
rising
shouting
to
his
mother
and
the
children
he
struck
a
light
and
leaped
into
the
water
and
taking
bub
in
his
arms
and
directing
the
movements
of
the
rest
he
hurried
them
out
of
the
door
away
from
the
river
bank
as
fast
as
they
could
go
how
providential
it
was
that
he
should
have
in
his
restlessness
dropped
his
hand
over
the
bedside
for
scarcely
had
they
ascended
a
swell
of
ground
beyond
the
field
when
the
cabin
went
down
with
a
crash
and
the
fragments
whirling
about
and
jarring
together
disappeared
from
view
they
were
now
poorer
than
ever
but
cold
and
wet
with
the
lightning
flashing
about
them
in
the
pouring
rain
they
clung
together
for
mutual
protection
while
they
took
their
toilsome
and
difficult
way
from
the
scene
of
danger
there
was
an
unoccupied
shanty
in
the
edge
of
the
town
farthest
from
the
river
and
to
that
tom
led
the
terrified
and
shivering
group
it
was
three
full
hours
before
they
reached
it
and
then
they
had
nothing
but
the
bare
walls
and
the
bare
floor
with
the
shelter
over
their
heads
for
a
where
the
next
day
the
missionary
found
them
as
he
went
about
assisting
to
succor
the
sufferers
and
at
his
suggestion
from
the
scanty
stores
of
the
settlers
about
their
cabin
was
fitted
out
with
eatables
and
housekeeping
articles
during
all
this
time
payson
had
been
so
occupied
in
benevolent
labor
among
those
whose
cabins
had
been
flooded
that
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
sustained
any
damage
but
after
the
subsiding
of
the
waters
as
he
took
his
way
down
his
favorite
path
through
the
grove
he
saw
that
the
waters
had
borne
away
every
vestige
of
fencing
around
his
cherished
lot
the
highest
part
of
the
fence
had
been
under
water
many
feet
on
that
calamitous
night
and
with
the
loss
of
the
rails
had
gone
down
another
of
the
earthly
props
on
which
he
had
leaned
for
his
daily
bread
in
the
wilderness
chapter
xiii
the
indian
lodge
spring
on
a
prairie
what
a
glorious
scene
suddenly
you
scarcely
know
when
the
snow
has
disappeared
leaving
the
long
dead
grass
lying
in
matted
unsightliness
and
you
would
think
it
was
dead
forever
but
soon
in
little
clusters
of
from
three
to
seven
you
see
dotting
the
landscape
a
purple
flower
a
tough
membranous
hairy
sheath
protecting
each
floweret
from
the
chilling
winds
for
it
opens
at
once
to
your
gaze
then
as
the
weather
waxes
genial
the
blossoms
shoot
up
from
their
hirsute
guardianship
and
nod
brightly
in
the
breeze
it
is
the
spring
beauty
as
the
frontier
folk
call
it
the
first
vegetation
of
the
season
presenting
the
phenomenon
of
rich
blooming
flowers
while
yet
the
lifeless
turf
shows
no
signs
of
vitality
but
life
is
there
for
at
once
as
if
by
magic
the
whole
expanse
is
green
with
verdure
growing
with
marvellous
rapidity
decked
with
flowers
garden
without
path
or
fence
rolling
up
its
billowy
blooms
then
you
rise
some
soft
morning
and
the
air
is
vocal
with
the
cooing
of
myriad
birds
if
you
are
just
from
the
east
you
will
think
that
thousands
of
turtle
doves
are
announcing
that
spring
has
come
they
seem
close
about
you
but
you
can
not
see
them
they
are
not
in
the
groves
near
by
you
follow
the
sounds
through
the
waving
prairie
grass
for
a
long
distance
and
you
find
them
not
and
will
be
surprised
when
your
western
friend
tells
you
that
these
are
the
voices
of
the
prairie
hens
miles
away
holding
their
annual
convention
the
queer
cuckooing
not
being
loving
sounds
but
notes
of
war
abortive
attempts
at
crowing
which
the
rival
males
set
up
as
they
prepare
to
do
battle
with
each
other
and
now
from
the
blue
expanse
overhead
come
down
the
varied
cries
of
the
migratory
birds
returning
from
the
south
line
upon
line
of
wild
geese
in
military
order
follow
their
leader
while
the
trumpet
blasts
of
the
cranes
the
ostrich
of
the
american
prairie
ring
out
clear
and
shrill
and
their
long
white
bills
glisten
in
the
sunlight
from
afar
like
bristling
bayonets
of
ivory
tom
stood
in
front
of
the
hotel
enjoying
the
spring
sights
and
sounds
with
unusual
zest
the
two
winters
now
past
had
been
eventful
to
him
payson
the
missionary
who
had
taken
a
great
interest
in
tom
had
the
winter
before
kept
school
in
his
own
cabin
and
tom
and
his
sister
eliza
had
attended
much
of
the
time
their
tuition
being
paid
by
such
assistance
as
tom
might
be
able
to
render
payson
in
his
outdoor
work
eliza
had
grown
to
be
a
sedate
and
interesting
young
woman
and
was
making
good
headway
with
her
studies
when
one
day
she
gave
notice
that
she
should
not
be
able
to
attend
school
any
longer
and
to
her
teacher
inquiries
she
returned
only
blushes
in
reply
and
he
could
get
no
further
light
until
the
next
day
when
an
enterprising
young
man
from
a
neighboring
village
twenty
miles
distant
called
to
invite
payson
to
join
himself
and
miss
eliza
in
marriage
the
last
winter
the
missionary
family
had
occupied
rooms
at
the
hotel
payson
had
been
growingly
unhappy
from
dread
of
the
indians
and
often
said
to
her
husband
our
lot
is
just
such
a
place
as
they
would
be
likely
to
come
to
first
payson
did
not
share
this
fear
but
on
account
of
her
feelings
the
landlord
offered
them
rooms
for
the
winter
rent
free
the
winter
had
gone
by
without
any
adverse
occurrence
tom
had
been
prospering
in
his
studies
under
the
missionary
direction
working
for
his
board
in
the
family
of
one
of
the
town
owners
just
opposite
the
hotel
so
it
was
but
a
step
for
him
to
the
missionary
when
he
wished
to
recite
will
you
be
able
to
hear
my
recitation
this
afternoon
asked
tom
as
payson
came
down
the
hotel
steps
yes
replied
the
missionary
i
am
called
away
this
morning
but
i
think
i
shall
get
back
in
season
that
afternoon
as
tom
sat
in
the
missionary
front
room
absorbed
in
a
book
the
furious
barking
of
a
dog
disturbed
him
he
glanced
out
of
the
window
and
saw
to
his
surprise
an
indian
the
savage
had
turned
facing
the
hotel
rifle
in
his
hand
and
with
flashing
eyes
was
driving
back
a
large
mastiff
that
had
attacked
him
tom
was
struck
with
the
singular
intelligence
and
beauty
of
the
young
savage
he
was
a
shade
lighter
than
most
of
his
race
had
large
dark
expressive
eyes
regular
and
features
a
symmetric
form
and
his
luxuriant
black
hair
which
was
of
great
length
was
dressed
with
most
elaborate
care
and
the
ornaments
that
he
wore
about
his
person
and
his
blanket
were
better
than
those
usually
worn
by
indians
from
the
indian
manner
tom
concluded
that
he
suspected
the
dog
was
set
upon
him
by
some
white
person
the
bearing
of
the
red
man
was
lofty
collected
and
defiant
in
an
instant
tom
sprang
down
the
front
stairs
and
called
the
dog
off
the
indian
glancing
at
the
lad
went
stolidly
on
his
way
up
the
main
street
through
the
village
till
he
was
hidden
from
view
by
the
trees
on
the
missionary
land
payson
and
her
children
stood
at
the
window
watching
the
retreating
figure
of
the
indian
with
mingled
fear
and
admiration
is
he
handsome
exclaimed
the
elder
of
the
little
girls
he
certainly
is
very
intelligent
looking
remarked
her
mother
a
noble
specimen
of
the
red
man
did
you
see
that
indian
inquired
the
landlady
a
calm
dignified
woman
as
she
stepped
into
the
room
one
of
the
boarders
says
there
is
quite
a
company
of
them
encamped
on
your
husbands
land
the
have
a
large
wigwam
and
seem
to
be
making
themselves
as
much
at
home
as
if
they
owned
the
place
the
missionary
wife
shuddered
and
remarked
it
is
just
as
i
foreboded
but
these
are
returned
the
landlady
the
chief
has
a
letter
from
the
government
agent
recommending
him
to
the
confidence
and
charity
of
the
settlers
it
has
been
a
long
and
hard
winter
and
the
agent
says
there
has
been
much
suffering
among
the
indians
is
that
young
indian
the
chief
asked
payson
no
i
wish
he
were
he
is
the
savage
i
ever
saw
i
do
think
i
should
be
afraid
to
trust
him
but
the
chief
looks
frightfully
he
is
as
cruel
and
treacherous
as
a
snake
or
i
do
not
read
his
face
aright
then
you
have
seen
him
said
the
other
in
surprise
yes
i
was
riding
through
the
woods
with
husband
and
we
met
him
the
young
indian
seems
to
belong
to
the
company
and
yet
holds
himself
somewhat
aloof
from
the
others
as
if
he
feels
conscious
of
being
superior
to
them
and
finds
it
difficult
to
fellowship
their
low
ways
a
party
of
us
are
going
to
call
on
the
indians
at
their
wigwam
and
i
stepped
in
to
invite
you
to
go
there
will
be
a
good
many
of
us
so
you
need
fear
being
tomahawked
she
added
laughing
the
visit
to
the
indians
the
next
day
was
full
of
interest
to
the
missionary
family
for
although
they
had
seen
numbers
of
the
indians
of
the
eastern
states
they
had
never
before
seen
the
red
man
in
his
native
wilds
with
habits
and
customs
unchanged
from
their
primitive
character
the
wigwam
was
large
and
well
constructed
erected
in
a
sheltered
and
romantic
spot
convenient
at
once
to
the
village
the
woods
and
the
river
within
were
squatted
four
or
five
of
the
company
on
the
ground
playing
a
game
of
chance
in
which
employment
the
indian
men
spend
most
of
their
time
when
not
hunting
fishing
or
at
war
there
were
no
women
with
them
and
therefore
the
men
had
besides
the
cooking
to
do
the
drudgery
usually
assigned
to
the
squaws
such
as
gathering
and
bringing
in
the
wood
and
dressing
the
skins
of
the
wild
animals
the
indians
did
not
lift
their
eyes
as
the
whites
entered
through
the
narrow
opening
which
served
as
door
and
ranged
themselves
around
the
sides
of
the
lodge
as
best
they
might
nor
did
they
answer
any
questions
not
appearing
to
understand
a
word
of
english
their
faces
remaining
as
stolid
under
the
remarks
of
the
whites
as
if
nothing
had
been
said
and
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
indians
were
as
ignorant
of
civilized
speech
as
they
appeared
some
of
the
inquisitive
indulged
themselves
in
quite
uncivilized
speeches
for
they
had
a
traditional
contempt
and
hatred
of
their
tawny
brothers
you
had
better
not
express
yourself
quite
so
freely
said
caswell
the
landlord
aside
to
a
settler
these
fellows
understand
every
word
you
say
and
it
better
to
have
the
good
will
than
the
ill
will
of
a
dog
as
the
old
saying
is
curious
however
to
see
what
the
effect
would
be
those
who
disliked
the
indians
the
most
made
them
presents
with
the
rest
tobacco
skeins
of
cotton
brass
buttons
cakes
crackers
cents
sticks
of
candy
bits
of
ribbon
were
received
by
the
indians
without
a
word
or
nod
of
acknowledgment
no
sign
of
consciousness
of
visitor
or
presents
was
evinced
save
that
a
grimy
hand
would
deftly
clutch
the
article
tossed
within
its
reach
and
convey
it
to
the
head
quickly
and
ingeniously
twisting
it
in
the
hair
the
game
proceeding
the
while
without
a
pause
the
young
indian
played
with
his
companions
and
from
his
beauty
and
princely
bearing
drew
much
attention
and
a
large
share
of
the
gifts
to
himself
yet
even
in
receiving
the
presents
he
seemed
different
from
the
other
savages
his
was
the
only
face
in
the
swarthy
group
that
betrayed
the
workings
of
the
soul
and
although
he
fastened
the
trinkets
in
his
raven
locks
drops
of
sweat
stood
on
his
brow
and
it
seemed
as
if
it
cost
him
a
struggle
to
be
treated
as
an
object
of
charity
tom
with
the
others
was
much
struck
with
the
appearance
of
the
young
indian
and
made
a
number
of
unsuccessful
attempts
to
converse
with
him
finding
that
the
confusion
of
tongues
or
some
other
barrier
had
made
talking
together
impossible
in
various
ingenious
ways
he
tried
to
direct
the
indian
attention
to
himself
but
without
avail
game
succeeded
game
in
indian
silence
the
talking
and
advancing
towards
acquaintanceship
remaining
wholly
on
the
side
of
the
whites
how
many
belong
to
this
company
asked
payson
of
the
landlord
there
are
nine
of
them
the
rest
are
out
hunting
i
suppose
was
the
reply
and
do
all
these
chaps
manage
to
sleep
in
this
little
hut
asked
a
settler
a
nice
time
they
must
have
of
it
on
the
ground
especially
when
it
rains
added
another
pointing
up
through
the
roof
which
was
open
to
let
out
the
smoke
but
said
the
missionary
everything
is
in
remarkable
order
here
do
you
see
that
each
man
has
his
place
and
on
the
side
of
the
lodge
a
snug
chance
to
stow
away
or
hang
up
his
personal
effects
we
whites
could
scarcely
arrange
the
little
space
with
more
fairness
and
mathematical
precision
so
as
to
make
the
most
of
the
room
it
was
indeed
so
and
much
did
the
callers
marvel
at
the
intelligent
system
that
prevailed
some
one
has
had
a
hand
in
the
ordering
of
affairs
here
who
has
more
intellect
than
we
are
accustomed
to
attribute
to
the
red
man
and
the
minister
glanced
at
the
young
indian
as
if
to
say
it
must
be
due
to
him
but
twilight
was
falling
and
the
villagers
started
on
their
way
home
scarcely
however
had
they
passed
the
hedge
of
elders
and
the
rows
of
young
oaks
that
hid
the
abode
of
the
indians
from
view
when
from
within
the
wigwam
there
went
up
a
startling
whoop
and
yell
mingled
with
derisive
laughter
payson
stood
still
pale
with
terror
as
if
expecting
to
see
the
savages
rush
out
to
massacre
them
but
they
kept
within
their
tent
their
horrible
whoopings
and
mockings
continuing
until
the
whites
were
well
away
i
do
not
like
the
sound
of
those
yells
said
the
missionary
soberly
o
the
indians
are
only
amusing
themselves
by
trying
to
scare
the
women
and
children
replied
caswell
merrily
there
is
more
than
that
intended
returned
the
minister
there
was
the
bitterest
irony
and
hatred
expressed
in
those
tones
if
the
authors
of
them
dared
or
it
was
in
their
plan
to
do
so
now
they
would
spring
upon
us
with
the
eagerness
of
so
many
beasts
of
prey
the
next
day
eight
of
the
indians
walked
into
the
village
one
after
the
other
as
is
the
indian
way
and
called
at
the
hotel
to
beg
they
had
found
their
tongues
over
night
and
could
manage
not
only
to
understand
when
it
was
for
their
interest
what
was
said
to
them
but
in
broken
english
make
reply
they
were
a
fine
set
of
men
physically
tall
erect
and
wrapped
in
their
white
and
red
blankets
they
made
a
formidable
appearance
there
was
no
touch
of
fawning
or
crouching
in
their
manner
they
demanded
the
articles
given
them
rather
than
begged
you
would
have
thought
them
lords
of
the
soil
come
to
collect
rent
of
tardy
tenantry
the
young
indian
however
still
preserved
his
individuality
and
various
romantic
conjectures
were
conjured
up
in
imaginative
heads
concerning
him
some
went
so
far
as
to
assert
that
he
had
no
indian
blood
in
him
and
started
the
theory
that
he
must
have
had
white
parentage
and
that
he
might
have
been
stolen
when
a
child
from
some
noble
white
family
but
the
more
experienced
of
the
pioneers
set
that
at
rest
by
affirming
that
they
could
tell
the
pure
unmixed
indian
and
that
he
was
one
tom
lingered
much
about
him
o
said
he
to
the
missionary
if
i
could
only
talk
with
him
how
i
would
love
to
teach
him
how
to
read
and
speak
to
him
of
the
blessed
things
in
the
bible
that
is
on
my
mind
most
of
the
time
tom
replied
the
good
man
i
am
often
asking
myself
can
i
not
in
some
way
lead
these
benighted
souls
to
the
lamb
of
god
but
how
inaccessible
they
are
what
an
impassable
barrier
between
them
and
us
and
with
the
exception
of
the
youngest
of
them
how
brutal
and
low
to
see
such
men
spend
their
time
squatted
on
the
earth
playing
or
some
equally
silly
game
from
morning
to
night
is
pitiful
and
then
their
yelling
and
laughter
are
more
like
wild
beasts
or
demons
than
human
beings
these
people
seem
to
me
the
lowest
meanest
most
treacherous
and
hardened
of
the
human
race
i
do
not
wonder
that
it
is
so
difficult
to
civilize
or
christianize
them
weeks
went
by
and
the
indians
remained
in
their
lodge
daily
growing
bolder
and
more
intrusive
till
they
had
become
obnoxious
to
the
most
benevolent
of
the
settlers
it
had
come
to
be
not
over
pleasant
to
the
women
of
the
neighborhood
to
look
up
from
their
domestic
duties
and
see
that
a
grim
savage
had
stolen
into
the
house
and
unasked
seated
himself
in
a
chair
ready
as
soon
as
he
thought
best
to
nod
in
a
dictatorial
way
towards
some
coveted
article
in
a
manner
which
meant
hand
that
to
me
meanwhile
tom
and
the
young
indian
who
whether
that
was
his
real
indian
name
or
not
was
called
had
become
quite
intimate
nevertheless
not
many
words
passed
between
them
for
long
hair
was
more
reticent
if
possible
than
the
rest
of
his
company
but
without
they
managed
to
understand
each
other
long
hair
indeed
appeared
to
read
tom
thoughts
intuitively
and
payson
was
often
made
anxious
for
tom
because
he
would
be
gone
so
long
in
the
woods
with
long
hair
the
latter
had
selected
a
tree
for
a
canoe
and
tom
with
his
axe
cut
it
down
for
him
and
helped
him
dig
it
out
and
shape
it
a
strange
sympathy
had
grown
up
between
them
and
one
evening
as
tom
was
on
his
way
to
the
chancing
to
meet
long
hair
he
invited
the
latter
to
accompany
him
trying
with
great
earnestness
to
make
him
comprehend
the
object
of
the
gathering
long
hair
seemed
to
gain
a
dim
perception
of
what
his
friend
meant
and
after
much
persuasion
entered
with
tom
the
cabin
in
which
the
meeting
was
to
be
held
the
indian
face
gave
evidence
of
great
excitement
as
the
services
progressed
the
deep
solemnity
of
the
prayers
and
the
devout
strains
of
christian
song
took
powerful
hold
of
the
red
man
feelings
doubtless
he
understood
little
of
the
scene
in
which
for
the
first
time
he
mingled
but
a
potent
influence
went
along
with
it
and
so
affected
was
he
that
his
hand
sought
tom
and
he
held
it
in
a
strong
tender
grasp
till
the
meeting
closed
his
frame
trembling
with
emotion
and
yet
tom
could
not
converse
with
him
afterwards
and
what
the
nature
of
the
emotion
was
that
shook
him
so
what
thoughts
were
stirred
and
with
what
result
for
eternity
in
the
bosom
of
that
silent
son
of
the
prairie
who
for
the
first
time
had
attended
christian
worship
no
one
knew
tom
could
not
induce
him
to
attend
again
and
yet
he
did
not
seem
offended
at
what
he
had
heard
but
when
his
white
friend
alluded
to
it
his
eye
gleamed
with
a
new
light
and
his
face
looked
thoughtfully
doubtfully
serious
nearly
every
day
tom
and
long
hair
were
together
the
latter
keeping
but
little
in
the
wigwam
and
seldom
going
with
the
other
indians
when
they
filed
into
town
and
besieged
the
houses
trying
the
doors
peeping
into
the
windows
accosting
the
long
hair
was
not
with
them
and
when
at
evening
they
returned
exultant
from
a
successful
hunt
singing
their
song
of
triumph
their
wild
and
scarcely
human
hi
yar
hi
yar
growing
nearer
till
entering
the
village
they
sang
their
way
through
to
their
lodge
long
hair
was
not
of
their
number
one
day
tom
chancing
to
visit
the
wigwam
found
long
hair
there
shivering
with
a
violent
attack
of
ague
he
was
alone
and
had
been
for
two
days
how
bare
and
cheerless
appeared
the
indian
life
to
tom
sympathetic
nature
then
for
an
indian
when
sick
has
few
comforts
solitary
he
sits
wrapped
in
his
blanket
or
lies
on
the
ground
with
no
one
to
nurse
or
care
for
him
no
nice
dishes
to
tempt
his
feeble
appetite
no
hand
to
bathe
his
fevered
brow
no
medicines
to
assuage
his
pain
or
drive
disease
away
why
long
hair
cried
tom
why
did
you
let
me
know
that
you
were
sick
but
long
hair
sat
shaking
in
his
blanket
and
as
usual
heard
but
made
no
answer
only
with
his
expressive
eyes
tom
brought
in
wood
and
started
the
fire
and
saying
mother
know
just
what
to
do
for
you
long
hair
i
go
and
tell
her
how
you
are
he
ran
to
his
mother
cabin
and
quickly
making
some
nourishing
gruel
and
putting
up
a
store
of
simples
that
she
used
in
fever
and
ague
she
returned
with
tom
to
the
lodge
what
a
treasure
is
a
loving
experienced
woman
in
sickness
whether
in
a
palace
a
log
house
or
beneath
the
rude
shelter
of
an
indian
moving
home
ever
gentle
exhaustless
in
resources
untiring
in
her
ministrations
it
seemed
a
marvel
to
tom
how
readily
his
mother
knew
just
what
to
do
for
long
hair
intuitively
adapting
herself
to
his
indian
peculiarities
and
for
the
week
that
his
illness
lasted
she
nursed
him
with
great
tenderness
often
remarking
to
tom
he
is
one
of
god
children
tom
for
the
bible
says
has
made
of
one
blood
all
the
nations
of
men
to
dwell
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
jesus
died
for
the
red
man
as
much
as
for
the
white
through
all
this
womanly
care
of
him
by
jones
and
brotherly
attention
of
tom
the
indian
while
shivering
with
the
chill
or
burning
and
panting
with
the
fever
made
no
acknowledgments
of
kindness
shown
him
or
uttered
a
word
of
complaint
as
he
suffered
and
when
he
recovered
returned
in
silence
to
his
indian
occupations
i
would
give
one
of
the
red
skins
a
glass
of
water
to
save
his
life
exclaimed
a
settler
who
had
lost
by
the
depredations
of
the
indians
there
is
a
particle
of
gratitude
in
one
of
give
any
of
them
all
you
have
and
ten
to
one
he
steal
upon
you
out
of
a
bush
and
take
your
scalp
it
is
too
true
of
most
of
the
indians
i
admit
said
jones
and
perhaps
long
hair
will
prove
ungrateful
but
i
only
did
as
the
bible
directs
and
i
am
contented
but
some
days
after
as
long
hair
strode
into
her
cabin
with
a
deer
on
his
shoulder
which
he
deposited
at
her
feet
saying
as
he
left
for
he
tarried
not
to
sit
down
white
squaw
much
good
long
hair
bring
venison
jones
wiped
the
tears
from
her
eyes
rejoicing
more
to
find
that
there
was
gratitude
even
in
an
indian
heart
than
at
receiving
his
generous
gift
illustration
longhair
and
his
present
page
chapter
xiv
the
payson
sat
sewing
in
her
pleasant
room
at
the
hotel
her
thoughts
were
far
away
from
the
checkered
experiences
of
the
frontier
for
her
husband
having
received
by
the
last
mail
a
new
book
from
an
eastern
friend
read
while
she
plied
her
needle
baby
was
in
his
crib
in
the
adjoining
and
fannie
and
helen
were
whispering
in
a
matronly
way
in
the
corner
as
with
the
help
of
mother
scissors
they
fitted
their
dolls
to
new
dresses
had
you
looked
in
upon
the
group
you
would
not
realize
that
they
constituted
a
pioneer
missionary
family
for
the
hotel
building
was
tasteful
and
spacious
and
if
they
lived
and
dressed
plainly
and
often
felt
the
pinchings
of
poverty
their
appearance
betrayed
no
unhappiness
and
then
the
volume
had
transported
the
father
and
mother
to
other
and
brighter
scenes
than
those
of
the
uncultured
wilderness
the
tone
of
the
reader
in
its
subdued
or
impassioned
modulations
attested
the
interest
he
felt
in
the
volume
and
the
heightened
color
of
the
wife
showed
her
sympathy
with
the
theme
what
a
magician
is
a
book
it
can
cause
the
poor
to
forget
their
poverty
and
the
wanderer
in
a
distant
land
to
become
oblivious
of
his
exile
what
was
that
exclaimed
the
missionary
and
his
wife
at
once
as
they
sprang
to
their
feet
in
breathless
suspense
again
the
horrible
cry
broke
forth
seeming
to
come
from
the
room
below
at
this
moment
the
fair
face
of
the
landlady
appeared
and
she
said
the
indians
are
below
and
are
going
to
sing
for
us
wo
you
come
down
and
hear
them
rather
discordant
music
answered
the
minister
but
i
think
we
may
as
well
accept
your
invitation
do
you
wife
and
taking
the
children
with
them
they
descended
to
the
ranged
round
the
long
table
were
eight
savages
and
sitting
back
against
the
walls
a
few
boarders
for
most
of
the
household
were
away
some
of
the
indians
held
tin
pans
and
on
these
as
an
accompaniment
they
beat
time
with
iron
instruments
their
heavy
blows
making
a
deafening
din
and
their
harsh
guttural
notes
uttered
in
unison
made
the
diabolical
uproar
payson
inspection
of
the
performers
in
this
strange
concert
was
anything
but
satisfactory
to
him
the
manner
of
the
savages
was
impudent
and
brutal
beyond
anything
he
had
yet
seen
in
them
and
he
fancied
that
their
sneering
and
malignant
grimaces
and
contortions
of
the
body
expressed
evil
and
vengeful
passions
that
burned
within
on
the
faces
of
the
whites
a
startled
anxious
look
struggled
with
an
effort
to
feel
at
ease
and
fear
nothing
there
is
something
wrong
about
these
indians
whispered
the
minister
to
a
man
near
him
they
are
plotting
mischief
their
looks
and
tones
are
full
of
ugliness
and
i
am
convinced
that
if
they
intend
no
trouble
they
know
that
some
hidden
danger
threatens
us
see
how
that
chief
eye
glares
observe
the
murderous
leer
of
the
one
beside
him
notice
how
they
mock
and
insult
us
to
our
very
faces
now
how
awfully
jubilant
their
tones
as
if
they
had
us
at
their
mercy
do
you
suppose
they
are
secretly
armed
and
rising
he
went
calmly
from
indian
to
indian
lifting
the
blanket
of
each
to
see
if
a
rifle
cut
short
or
some
other
deadly
weapon
was
not
concealed
there
but
none
was
to
be
found
and
at
the
close
of
their
alarming
exhibition
the
chief
haughtily
arose
bowed
to
the
missionary
who
was
now
seated
again
and
passed
out
each
of
his
followers
imitating
him
in
the
salute
as
he
glided
from
the
room
the
indians
have
taken
down
their
wigwam
and
gone
away
said
tom
to
payson
the
next
day
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
replied
the
missionary
they
are
a
dangerous
set
and
i
have
been
quite
anxious
lest
the
settlers
should
get
into
a
quarrel
with
them
but
what
makes
you
look
so
depressed
are
any
of
your
folks
sick
no
replied
tom
striving
to
appear
calm
father
came
home
last
night
well
that
was
a
pleasant
surprise
was
it
not
interrupted
his
kind
friend
yes
but
but
he
wants
us
to
remove
remove
whereto
near
spirit
lake
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
i
heard
this
morning
that
the
sioux
are
quite
insolent
towards
the
settlers
in
that
vicinity
and
threaten
an
outbreak
i
must
see
your
father
and
dissuade
him
from
his
project
and
the
minister
proceeded
to
the
cabin
occupied
by
the
joneses
it
was
near
spirit
lake
that
jones
was
wounded
by
the
indian
this
however
did
not
deter
him
from
going
there
again
to
hunt
three
promising
young
settlements
had
sprung
up
there
side
by
side
for
the
beauty
fertility
and
cheapness
of
the
land
had
attracted
quite
an
immigration
that
way
jones
had
mingled
much
with
the
settlers
for
an
entirely
country
had
special
charms
for
him
and
his
knowledge
of
all
matters
most
needful
to
the
pioneer
made
him
a
welcome
acquaintance
he
had
become
a
great
favorite
with
the
inhabitants
the
indians
were
numerous
and
bold
but
entertained
a
wholesome
dread
of
the
squatter
rifle
and
personal
courage
and
the
whites
although
they
did
not
anticipate
serious
trouble
with
the
savages
felt
so
much
safer
when
he
was
with
them
that
they
offered
him
a
comfortable
cabin
and
promised
other
advantages
if
he
would
dwell
among
them
among
the
indians
jones
went
by
the
name
of
and
they
expressed
great
admiration
of
his
marksmanship
occasions
not
unfrequently
happened
for
him
to
show
his
superior
qualities
in
that
line
for
example
the
squatter
happened
in
one
day
at
a
cabin
and
found
some
half
dozen
indians
there
who
had
busied
themselves
in
the
absence
of
the
men
in
rummaging
the
house
for
plunder
greatly
to
the
terror
of
the
women
and
children
as
jones
appeared
they
seated
themselves
with
indian
gravity
refusing
to
answer
a
word
while
their
faces
wore
an
angry
and
sullen
look
among
these
were
some
famous
for
their
skill
with
the
rifle
and
knowing
their
passion
for
he
proposed
at
once
a
trial
of
skill
this
was
eagerly
accepted
but
the
squatter
triumphed
in
the
contest
and
the
indians
went
away
much
impressed
with
the
result
when
jones
returned
to
his
family
and
mentioned
his
decision
to
remove
the
mother
heard
his
account
with
a
foreboding
heart
but
made
no
objection
only
saying
we
must
take
tom
away
from
his
studies
to
this
the
father
assented
for
he
really
felt
grateful
to
the
missionary
for
the
interest
he
took
in
his
son
and
proud
of
the
progress
the
lad
was
making
in
his
books
tom
said
he
has
a
good
chance
and
it
is
in
me
to
discourage
him
it
was
however
more
difficult
to
persuade
tom
to
remain
behind
than
for
his
parents
to
give
him
up
hard
as
it
was
for
them
he
had
so
long
been
the
staff
of
his
mother
that
it
seemed
like
selfish
desertion
for
him
to
stay
with
the
missionary
while
she
went
farther
off
on
the
frontier
it
is
your
to
remain
tom
urged
the
mother
god
has
opened
the
way
for
you
to
cultivate
your
mind
and
fit
yourself
for
usefulness
and
we
shall
not
be
so
far
away
but
that
you
can
come
to
us
at
any
time
if
we
need
you
and
are
you
not
afraid
to
go
where
there
are
so
many
indians
asked
tom
yes
she
replied
i
am
afraid
and
yet
i
feel
strengthened
to
go
your
father
will
be
useful
there
he
is
fitted
to
take
the
lead
in
case
of
trouble
with
the
savages
the
settlers
look
up
to
him
and
depend
upon
him
and
i
can
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
hold
him
back
and
if
he
goes
it
is
best
for
me
to
be
with
him
if
you
remain
behind
we
shall
have
in
you
a
friend
to
assist
us
if
any
trouble
should
arise
you
might
be
able
to
do
more
for
us
here
than
if
shut
up
with
us
by
a
common
danger
and
so
with
many
a
last
farewell
by
the
fond
mother
tom
saw
them
start
for
their
new
home
chapter
xv
the
massacre
at
spirit
lake
between
the
settlement
in
which
the
missionary
lived
and
the
one
next
was
a
wide
prairie
succeeded
by
a
stretch
of
primitive
forests
through
which
down
its
abysmal
rocky
bed
ran
a
foaming
river
the
limestone
bluffs
that
formed
its
banks
abounded
in
holes
and
caves
fitting
homes
for
wild
beasts
here
the
cry
of
the
panther
might
be
heard
and
bears
and
wolves
sought
their
food
through
these
gloomy
solitudes
tom
was
making
his
way
in
the
buggy
which
the
missionary
had
provided
for
tom
had
been
intrusted
with
the
errand
of
going
to
the
village
beyond
for
a
trunk
which
had
arrived
from
the
east
for
payson
he
was
jogging
along
listening
to
the
strange
sounds
of
the
forest
for
it
was
near
here
the
last
winter
that
a
sight
met
his
gaze
that
he
could
never
forget
there
had
been
a
succession
of
those
which
so
often
come
in
the
night
in
minnesota
and
go
off
at
leaving
a
perfectly
even
coating
of
snow
over
everything
the
sleighing
was
quite
passable
and
the
weather
that
day
mild
coming
suddenly
to
an
open
space
within
a
few
feet
of
him
were
two
large
gray
wolves
eating
a
horse
not
yet
dead
the
poor
beast
was
still
attached
to
his
team
and
hopelessly
struggled
against
his
twofold
fate
for
he
had
fallen
into
a
that
the
treacherous
snow
had
concealed
and
his
driver
unable
to
extricate
him
had
abandoned
him
to
his
fate
or
gone
for
help
brandishing
his
whip
tom
shouted
at
the
wolves
in
hope
of
frightening
them
off
they
only
raised
their
heads
to
glare
threateningly
at
him
their
jaws
dripping
blood
then
voraciously
resumed
their
gory
repast
tearing
great
quivering
masses
of
flesh
from
the
struggling
beast
which
they
seemed
to
swallow
without
chewing
with
such
a
ravenous
appetite
did
they
eat
tom
was
a
brave
lad
but
as
he
descended
the
side
of
the
hill
towards
the
river
and
the
dense
shadows
made
his
way
dim
although
it
was
high
noon
and
a
brilliant
sun
was
flooding
the
prairies
he
could
not
shake
off
a
feeling
of
dread
that
had
grown
upon
him
every
now
and
then
he
caught
himself
starting
with
nervous
apprehension
and
to
break
the
spell
he
began
to
whistle
a
merry
tune
to
keep
up
his
courage
as
boys
are
wont
to
do
but
he
was
thinking
how
dismally
it
sounded
when
suddenly
in
the
distance
rang
out
the
clear
notes
of
a
robin
tom
involuntarily
reined
in
his
horse
at
that
for
the
call
of
that
bird
his
indian
friend
long
hair
used
to
imitate
for
a
signal
and
had
taught
tom
how
to
do
it
for
the
sake
of
long
hair
said
tom
more
cheerily
i
answer
you
old
bird
but
scarcely
had
he
done
so
when
to
his
surprise
the
bird
responded
well
said
tom
you
think
i
your
mate
i
guess
and
if
you
choose
to
give
me
your
company
i
shall
not
object
it
is
so
lonely
here
so
he
answered
the
robin
again
instantly
the
bushes
parted
and
long
hair
stepped
into
view
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
his
blanket
torn
and
his
whole
appearance
indicated
that
something
unusual
had
happened
why
long
hair
exclaimed
tom
greatly
startled
what
is
the
matter
the
indian
glanced
warily
about
then
laid
his
ear
to
the
ground
listening
intently
and
arose
quickly
saying
indian
come

horse
know

tom
saw
from
long
hair
manner
that
it
was
no
time
for
delay
and
leaping
from
the
wagon
with
marvellous
quickness
the
indian
turned
the
horse
head
about
facing
home
and
striking
him
smartly
the
spirited
animal
rapidly
retraced
his
way
at
their
right
rose
a
rocky
ridge
to
a
considerable
height
springing
up
which
long
hair
motioned
tom
to
follow
the
other
side
was
quite
precipitous
but
a
narrow
fissure
in
the
rock
afforded
a
scanty
footing
down
which
the
indian
glided
tom
following
him
although
dizzy
with
the
height
passing
along
for
a
short
distance
they
came
to
a
scrub
oak
the
roots
of
which
had
struck
into
the
side
of
the
ledge
climbing
around
it
a
small
opening
appeared
motioning
tom
to
enter
long
hair
said
if
both
stay
injun
kill
both
long
hair
run
swift
like
deer
and
he
darted
up
the
ridge
again
with
agility
when
tom
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
darkness
he
found
himself
in
a
spacious
rocky
room
it
was
one
of
those
natural
caves
which
seem
as
if
the
work
of
art
rather
than
a
freak
of
nature
the
room
was
almost
a
perfect
square
and
extending
around
its
sides
was
a
seat
of
solid
rock
while
in
a
square
hole
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
excavated
for
the
purpose
was
a
spring
the
water
of
which
was
icy
cold
and
of
crystal
clearness
tom
seated
himself
to
await
the
result
of
the
strange
events
that
had
so
suddenly
befallen
him
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
in
the
forest
and
had
he
not
known
enough
of
the
indian
acuteness
in
detecting
the
approach
of
a
concealed
or
distant
foe
he
would
have
doubted
long
hair
representations
of
the
impending
peril
indeed
as
the
moments
sped
and
they
seemed
long
to
him
he
had
begun
to
consider
the
propriety
of
venturing
out
to
look
about
a
little
when
a
slight
rustle
in
the
ravine
below
arrested
his
attention
at
any
other
time
he
would
not
have
noticed
the
sound
it
was
so
like
the
passing
of
the
breeze
the
scrawny
roots
of
the
tree
at
the
entrance
of
the
cave
and
the
darkness
within
protected
him
from
observation
and
drawing
nearer
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
he
watched
the
bushes
below
with
strained
eye
he
had
not
long
to
wait
when
he
saw
an
indian
creeping
cautiously
along
then
a
little
farther
off
another
came
into
view
and
still
another
they
were
long
hair
pursuers
and
from
their
belts
hung
a
number
of
scalps
which
from
their
bloody
appearance
showed
that
they
had
recently
been
taken
and
the
luxuriant
tresses
of
some
of
them
indicated
that
they
were
from
the
heads
of
white
women
at
the
sight
tom
blood
almost
froze
in
his
veins
but
his
heart
gave
a
sudden
bound
as
he
heard
the
sound
of
soft
footfalls
from
this
he
judged
that
the
indians
had
got
upon
long
hair
trail
and
some
of
them
had
gone
round
in
front
of
the
ridge
while
the
others
followed
closely
in
his
track
tom
felt
that
his
hour
had
come
and
a
mortal
terror
seized
him
then
thinking
of
his
imperilled
father
and
mother
to
whose
succor
long
hair
had
bidden
him
go
he
was
astonished
at
the
fierce
reaction
which
followed
he
had
no
weapons
so
planting
himself
behind
the
tree
he
lay
in
wait
ready
to
spring
upon
the
first
intruder
and
hurl
him
into
the
depths
below
the
dark
figure
of
an
indian
creeping
stealthily
along
like
a
horrid
serpent
he
saw
cautiously
approaching
the
tree
a
moment
more
and
the
death
grapple
would
come
when
an
exclamation
above
made
the
indian
turn
his
head
long
hair
trail
returning
from
the
cave
had
been
struck
by
another
indian
at
the
same
instant
long
defiant
challenging
his
pursuers
to
come
on
was
heard
in
the
distance
the
answering
yell
of
the
savages
from
the
ravine
below
and
the
ridge
above
rang
out
as
they
dashed
after
the
indian
unaware
of
the
presence
of
tom
stepped
to
the
tree
to
turn
himself
on
the
face
of
the
cliff
so
that
he
stood
with
his
brawny
back
close
to
tom
his
waist
also
was
hung
with
gory
scalps
the
sight
maddened
tom
to
frenzy
the
savage
let
go
the
tree
and
started
to
join
the
chase
when
tom
thrust
his
hands
at
once
through
the
fissure
and
sent
him
headlong
from
the
precipice
the
body
struck
with
a
dull
heavy
thud
and
all
was
still
tom
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
pursuit
as
it
died
away
and
knew
that
there
was
now
no
immediate
danger
to
him
and
stooping
down
he
took
a
long
draught
from
the
spring
and
bathed
his
fevered
brow
then
climbing
out
of
his
he
passed
quickly
upon
the
ridge
and
descended
into
the
ravine
below
where
lay
the
mutilated
form
of
the
red
man
who
knows
but
he
is
the
murderer
of
some
of
our
family
he
said
as
he
drew
near
no
none
of
our
folks
have
such
hair
as
that
he
added
after
examining
the
scalps
one
by
one
then
taking
possession
of
the
rifle
and
and
thrusting
the
indian
into
his
belt
and
throwing
some
limbs
over
the
body
that
it
might
not
so
soon
be
discovered
by
his
friends
tom
hurried
away
in
the
direction
of
the
fort
as
long
hair
had
suggested
he
lingered
a
moment
however
wishing
that
he
could
do
something
to
serve
long
hair
who
he
well
knew
had
uttered
that
challenging
that
saved
his
life
on
purpose
to
call
the
indians
away
from
the
cave
but
what
was
he
a
mere
boy
against
so
many
infuriated
savages
besides
they
were
now
far
away
he
knew
not
where
moreover
long
hair
had
charged
him
to
go
for
the
soldiers
to
rescue
his
father
and
mother
and
without
further
hesitation
he
turned
his
steps
towards
the
fort
tom
was
in
good
health
a
quick
walker
and
like
his
father
accustomed
to
thread
the
woods
and
traverse
the
prairies
tom
was
agitated
with
strong
and
conflicting
emotions
as
he
pursued
his
lonely
way
his
had
been
terribly
roused
by
the
exciting
scenes
through
which
he
had
just
passed
he
had
experienced
the
strange
feeling
which
men
feel
when
in
battle
they
are
stirred
by
danger
and
the
sight
of
blood
to
deeds
of
blood
it
was
under
this
feeling
that
he
was
led
to
precipitate
the
indian
from
the
bluff
and
to
view
his
remains
with
so
much
composure
but
now
a
faintness
came
stealing
over
him
his
young
heart
recoiled
at
the
thought
of
what
he
had
done
this
relenting
however
was
repelled
by
the
recollection
of
long
hair
heroism
and
his
father
and
mother
beleaguered
condition
if
indeed
the
tomahawk
ere
this
had
not
drank
their
life
how
many
days
had
passed
since
long
hair
had
seen
them
he
knew
not
but
it
was
easy
to
see
from
his
friend
anxiety
that
his
parents
were
in
an
extremity
of
danger
and
whether
he
could
succeed
in
procuring
assistance
for
them
in
season
seemed
doubtful
it
would
take
him
to
go
afoot
two
days
to
reach
the
fort
and
he
could
not
hope
to
get
to
his
father
settlement
with
the
soldiers
in
less
than
a
day
more
even
if
they
were
mounted
it
was
now
about
two
and
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
early
in
the
morning
but
he
thought
not
of
food
as
he
hurried
on
with
the
accuracy
of
the
practised
pioneer
he
struck
a
for
the
fort
this
took
him
some
miles
away
from
any
village
but
towards
night
he
reached
a
cabin
standing
alone
entering
he
found
the
family
just
taking
their
evening
meal
with
true
western
hospitality
the
man
of
the
house
urged
him
to
sit
down
and
partake
with
them
while
his
wife
poured
out
a
generous
bowl
of
strong
black
coffee
which
as
was
the
custom
was
used
without
sugar
or
milk
and
she
heaped
his
plate
with
fried
pork
and
hot
mealy
potatoes
while
by
the
side
of
his
plate
she
laid
a
generous
slice
of
brown
bread
tom
partook
with
a
relish
that
did
honor
to
the
fare
where
are
you
from
and
where
are
you
bound
my
lad
asked
the
man
who
had
refrained
from
questions
until
he
saw
that
his
guest
was
well
under
way
eating
tom
mouth
and
heart
were
full
and
between
them
both
he
found
it
difficult
to
reply
he
was
painfully
hungry
from
his
long
fast
and
the
thrilling
experiences
of
the
day
and
his
brain
was
greatly
excited
i
am
going
said
he
answering
the
last
question
first
perhaps
because
it
was
nearest
at
hand
to
the
fort
after
help
after
help
cried
the
wife
stopping
short
in
the
act
of
transferring
a
potato
from
the
end
of
her
fork
to
tom
plate
holding
it
aloft
unconsciously
ai
any
trouble
down
your
way
with
the
injuns
is
there
no
not
exactly
said
tom
and
the
good
woman
relieved
remembered
the
potato
and
deposited
it
as
she
had
designed
then
was
proceeding
to
place
another
slice
of
pork
beside
it
just
as
tom
added
but
i
saw
lots
of
them
this
morning
not
more
than
twelve
miles
from
here
and
they
looked
fierce
enough
in
their
and
with
the
bloody
scalps
dangling
from
their
bodies
goodness
gracious
exclaimed
the
good
lady
and
again
forgetting
herself
she
paused
with
the
pork
letting
the
fat
drip
upon
the
snowy
cloth
i
told
you
husband
they
be
down
upon
us
yet
and
we
three
miles
from
any
neighbor
and
as
tom
commenced
his
recital
of
the
occurrences
of
the
morning
she
sat
down
in
her
chair
with
the
slice
of
meat
still
in
its
elevated
position
and
the
gravy
dripping
into
her
lap
while
the
husband
ceased
eating
and
listened
with
interest
tom
eyed
the
pork
longingly
as
he
continued
his
narration
and
seeing
no
prospect
of
getting
it
abruptly
said
i
had
tasted
a
bit
of
food
till
i
came
here
since
five
this
morning
and
i
got
to
walk
all
night
law
me
ejaculated
his
hostess
if
i
have
forgot
to
help
ye
i
was
so
scared
the
injuns
and
she
passed
it
adding
husband
you
jist
go
down
cellar
and
bring
up
a
pumpkin
pie
and
some
o
that
gingerbread
the
boy
must
leave
this
huss
till
had
his
fill
and
the
tears
came
into
her
large
blue
eyes
and
are
you
going
with
the
sojers
over
among
the
injuns
where
your
father
and
mother
is
yes
answered
tom
why
it
seems
to
me
that
a
stripling
like
you
had
best
stay
behind
and
keep
out
o
danger
one
o
them
injuns
would
make
nothin
taking
your
scalp
tom
spirit
rose
at
this
and
he
told
them
how
he
killed
the
indian
in
the
morning
well
i
never
said
the
good
lady
in
blank
astonishment
why
i
do
my
husband
here
would
be
any
more
dependence
if
them
wild
critters
should
come
beseeching
our
dwelling
than
a
at
which
the
husband
thrust
his
hand
up
into
his
wiry
hair
till
he
made
it
stand
upon
end
all
over
his
head
while
he
grew
very
red
in
the
face
and
said
fiercely
let
the
varmints
come
on
if
they
wants
to
guess
i
could
stand
it
if
you
could
tom
saw
that
there
was
danger
of
a
falling
out
between
his
fat
overgrown
hostess
and
her
diminutive
husband
and
adroitly
said
we
do
any
one
of
us
know
what
we
could
do
until
the
time
comes
i
was
surprised
myself
at
what
i
had
done
well
said
the
woman
restored
to
good
humor
there
a
great
deal
o
good
sense
in
that
remark
i
know
it
from
experience
for
when
i
had
the
toothache
so
that
i
could
sleep
nights
for
a
week
and
husband
wanted
to
take
me
over
to
groveville
to
the
doctor
i
felt
as
weak
as
but
when
i
got
there
i
had
out
two
jaw
teeth
and
a
stump
without
wincin
as
you
may
say
and
the
doctor
said
like
me
for
a
subject
to
pull
on
all
the
time
but
i
told
him
it
would
take
two
to
make
a
bargain
on
that
i
reckoned
and
she
laughed
heartily
at
the
remembrance
of
her
own
wit
but
tom
had
finished
his
meal
and
rose
to
go
when
his
hostess
said
you
wo
think
in
the
night
will
yer
every
moment
is
precious
replied
tom
well
husband
said
she
if
the
boy
feels
under
the
circumstances
that
he
must
go
it
is
in
me
to
detain
him
but
it
seems
to
me
we
orter
do
as
we
be
did
by
and
help
him
onto
his
way
a
piece
now
you
jist
go
and
harness
the
hoss
into
the
waggin
while
i
put
up
something
to
stay
his
stomach
like
till
he
gets
to
the
fort
you
could
drive
him
there
just
as
well
as
not
husband
pretty
long
drive
observed
the
man
looking
out
of
the
little
window
dubiously
well
but
she
persisted
you
see
the
child
got
to
go
all
the
way
afoot
and
it
take
so
long
that
his
folks
be
killed
murdered
tomahawked
and
scalped
afore
he
can
git
there
then
waxing
warm
an
if
you
an
i
was
in
that
perdicament
we
want
them
as
was
going
to
help
us
not
to
aggervate
our
feelin
by
coming
to
our
rescue
when
it
was
too
late
yes
yes
returned
the
little
man
unable
to
reply
to
his
wordy
reasoning
now
if
you
not
afeard
said
he
bristling
his
hair
and
reddening
again
afeard
i
was
only
thinking
if
the
injuns
should
come
whilst
gone
what
would
become
of
you
barbery
jane
well
said
she
looking
aghast
and
sinking
into
her
chair
anew
i
declare
if
i
had
forgot
that
but
she
was
a
person
who
made
it
a
point
to
carry
her
point
in
all
domestic
arrangements
and
controversies
with
her
lord
and
partly
on
this
principle
and
partly
we
hope
from
a
worthier
motive
she
rallied
and
added
but
i
risk
it
if
you
will
james
an
i
more
in
danger
you
are
bein
i
so
fleshy
you
can
hide
most
anywhere
in
the
woods
and
they
could
find
ye
any
more
a
needle
in
a
haymow
an
i
never
could
stand
it
to
think
o
that
we
been
sich
cowards
cowards
interrupted
her
husband
goaded
by
this
for
on
the
matter
of
size
and
courage
he
was
specially
sore
a
wound
which
his
spouse
took
care
to
keep
open
cowards
and
bristling
about
and
striking
his
feet
together
he
bustled
out
and
with
commendable
energy
soon
had
the
horse
in
the
buggy
before
the
door
tom
sprang
in
as
the
woman
passed
him
a
bountiful
supply
of
provisions
saying
as
she
wiped
her
eyes
with
her
apron
i
hope
next
time
you
come
this
way
you
be
alive
an
well
but
dreadful
afeard
the
injuns
git
ye
the
latter
remark
seemed
to
have
more
effect
upon
her
husband
than
tom
for
the
flush
disappeared
from
his
cheeks
again
the
ponderous
wife
watched
the
wagon
until
it
was
out
of
sight
then
with
much
pains
fastened
the
little
window
and
the
outer
door
and
going
to
her
trunk
took
from
thence
a
copy
of
the
bible
and
sat
down
and
read
a
chapter
a
duty
which
she
always
performed
on
extra
occasions
and
especially
in
times
of
danger
it
mattered
not
to
her
what
chapter
she
read
and
she
now
opened
to
the
genealogical
records
in
first
chronicles
she
was
a
poor
reader
at
best
but
she
struggled
on
with
those
names
of
foreign
accent
feeling
much
safer
with
the
exercise
while
her
thoughts
were
far
away
following
tom
and
her
husband
in
truth
she
had
done
a
good
deed
and
one
that
had
cost
her
a
real
sacrifice
in
sending
away
her
husband
with
the
horse
to
accompany
the
lad
and
the
consciousness
of
this
began
to
fill
her
with
happiness
calmed
as
she
was
by
the
feeling
of
security
which
the
use
of
the
good
book
imparted
hers
was
a
faith
but
who
shall
say
that
she
was
not
accepted
and
blessed
according
to
the
measure
of
her
light
who
would
not
choose
to
be
such
a
one
with
her
defective
knowledge
and
her
weak
superstition
as
some
would
call
it
than
the
proud
sceptic
ever
croaking
like
some
hideous
as
he
turns
his
bleared
eyes
away
from
the
beams
of
the
sun
of
righteousness
no
god
no
bible
no
saviour
no
heaven
of
blessedness
no
immortality
wandering
through
life
without
hope
and
god
in
the
world
and
at
death
taking
a
frightful
leap
in
the
dark
chapter
xvi
a
beleaguered
cabin
it
was
a
misty
morning
when
tom
and
his
companion
approached
the
fort
the
air
was
damp
with
vapor
and
the
american
flag
with
its
glorious
stars
and
stripes
drooped
heavily
the
fortress
was
on
the
very
outskirts
of
civilization
on
an
elevated
point
of
land
commanding
an
extensive
prospect
on
every
side
richly
diversified
prairies
rarely
pressed
by
the
white
man
foot
gave
one
an
impressive
sense
of
vastness
and
magnificence
as
the
sun
arose
and
the
curtain
of
fog
rolled
off
tom
gazed
on
the
landscape
for
accustomed
as
he
was
to
prairie
scenery
he
had
never
seen
any
view
that
equalled
this
not
an
injun
could
come
nigh
this
ere
fort
said
the
little
man
that
held
the
reins
everybody
has
to
be
seen
no
matter
how
fur
off
they
be
specially
when
the
officers
gits
their
telescopes
to
their
eyes
why
i
suppose
they
can
see
hundreds
o
miles
with
one
of
them
big
glasses
any
rate
i
heard
tell
about
their
seeing
clean
up
to
the
stars
an
a
good
piece
beyend
they
had
now
approached
a
gate
before
which
paced
an
armed
sentry
in
answer
to
whose
challenge
the
little
man
who
grew
consequential
as
he
neared
the
citadel
said
this
ere
youngster
sojer
wants
to
see
the
commander
of
this
ere
institution
on
very
perticler
business
which
admits
of
no
delay
the
man
with
the
gun
sent
a
message
into
the
fort
without
a
word
in
reply
until
the
messenger
returned
when
he
said
laconically
pass
in
tom
had
never
before
seen
a
fortress
and
surveyed
with
eager
interest
the
rows
of
heavy
guns
and
the
in
conical
shaped
piles
and
the
long
brick
buildings
extending
around
the
spacious
square
from
the
centre
of
which
rose
the
flagstaff
grimly
as
frowned
the
guns
and
warlike
munitions
the
neatness
and
order
that
reigned
had
a
pleasing
effect
on
tom
mind
and
within
those
buildings
standing
amid
the
solitudes
of
the
wilderness
in
the
families
of
the
officers
gayety
and
mirth
often
held
carnival
already
a
gush
of
music
elicited
by
fair
fingers
from
a
piano
was
borne
through
an
open
window
into
the
court
below
then
a
clear
sweet
voice
accompanied
the
instrument
pooty
as
a
bird
and
a
plaguy
sight
nicer
exclaimed
the
little
man
as
he
frisked
about
hitching
his
horse
to
an
post
tom
and
his
friend
were
shown
into
the
of
the
commander
of
the
fort
the
officer
was
an
early
riser
and
breakfasted
betimes
the
mahogany
extension
table
was
set
with
an
elegant
service
general
mcelroy
was
a
tall
slender
man
with
hair
and
face
his
wife
a
stately
lady
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
a
boy
of
seven
in
highland
costume
was
at
her
side
while
black
nancy
flitted
in
and
out
with
viands
in
her
hands
well
my
lad
said
the
general
sedately
what
do
you
want
of
me
motioning
his
callers
to
be
seated
tom
commenced
to
state
the
occasion
of
his
calling
and
the
stolid
features
lighted
up
with
growing
interest
and
he
said
wait
a
moment
my
boy
i
guess
you
a
message
important
enough
and
it
will
save
time
for
you
to
relate
it
to
two
of
us
at
once
and
pulling
a
a
soldier
appeared
to
whom
he
said
tell
captain
manly
that
i
wish
to
see
him
in
a
moment
the
personage
came
in
he
was
about
forty
of
frank
open
face
and
soldierly
bearing
tom
liked
him
at
the
first
glance
captain
said
the
general
i
want
you
to
hear
this
boy
story
commence
again
my
lad
and
state
the
whole
as
briefly
and
connectedly
as
you
can
when
tom
finished
his
recital
you
are
a
brave
little
fellow
said
the
general
and
in
my
opinion
if
you
were
in
the
ranks
you
would
be
sure
to
be
well
spoken
of
then
turning
to
the
captain
he
added
this
is
grave
business
manly
and
something
should
be
done
for
the
settlers
whom
this
boy
represents
i
heard
that
an
indian
called
at
the
fort
and
tried
to
make
us
understand
that
there
was
an
uprising
and
i
suppose
it
was
this
long
hair
that
the
lad
tells
about
but
i
did
not
attach
much
importance
to
what
he
said
and
now
manly
i
want
you
to
take
a
detachment
of
men
for
i
think
i
can
depend
on
you
to
do
it
up
right
see
that
they
are
well
mounted
and
provisioned
and
that
their
arms
are
in
good
order
but
you
understand
all
about
that
and
go
to
the
relief
of
the
settlement
that
these
villains
have
beset
then
turning
to
tom
he
asked
what
is
your
name
young
man
thomas
jones
he
replied
well
thomas
i
conclude
you
will
want
to
go
with
the
men
yes
sir
and
do
you
know
the
shortest
route
to
the
settlement
in
question
tom
answered
affirmatively
include
a
horse
for
the
boy
use
captain
and
see
that
he
is
well
provided
for
he
may
be
of
use
in
piloting
the
way
at
any
rate
he
is
a
fellow
and
deserves
consideration
at
our
hands
how
many
men
will
you
need
captain
i
as
lief
have
forty
as
more
if
i
can
have
my
pick
make
such
arrangements
as
will
please
you
and
i
hope
to
have
a
good
report
when
you
come
back
the
rascally
should
be
taught
a
severe
lesson
for
this
outrage
or
they
may
commit
more
tom
and
his
friend
rose
to
withdraw
with
the
when
the
general
said
but
you
have
not
told
me
how
far
you
came
this
morning
we
rode
all
night
returned
tom
i
took
supper
at
this
man
cabin
and
he
brought
me
here
in
his
wagon
to
save
time
bless
me
ejaculated
the
general
as
he
left
the
table
that
has
the
true
ring
in
it
nancy
see
that
these
folks
have
a
sip
of
coffee
and
something
to
eat
and
when
you
broke
your
fast
my
lad
come
out
into
the
square
i
guess
the
captain
will
be
ready
by
that
time
tom
felt
some
diffidence
about
accepting
the
invitation
of
the
general
but
mcelroy
was
a
true
lady
and
her
winning
smile
as
she
filled
his
cup
with
the
fragrant
beverage
from
the
silver
urn
put
him
at
ease
she
had
many
a
woman
question
to
ask
about
his
adventures
of
yesterday
morning
and
seemed
never
to
tire
admiring
his
heroic
conduct
he
was
just
explaining
for
the
third
time
how
he
pushed
the
savage
from
the
cliff
when
his
voice
was
drowned
by
that
of
a
girl
who
came
tripping
and
singing
through
the
long
hall
that
led
into
the
hers
were
the
same
notes
that
came
through
the
open
window
it
was
the
general
only
daughter
alice
who
as
she
burst
into
the
apartment
stopped
in
surprise
as
she
saw
strangers
there
just
in
time
alice
said
the
mother
pleasantly
to
hear
this
story
the
girl
was
scarcely
in
her
teens
and
her
fair
face
expressive
of
good
sense
gentleness
and
intellectuality
was
set
off
by
a
wealth
of
auburn
curls
that
fell
in
careless
profusion
over
her
shoulders
tom
had
never
known
anything
of
sentiment
or
thought
much
of
personal
looks
but
he
had
a
quick
eye
for
grace
and
beauty
and
charmed
at
the
unexpected
ingress
of
the
little
fairy
he
forgot
alike
his
food
his
manners
and
his
story
and
gazed
in
stupid
silence
at
the
lovely
apparition
the
mother
comprehended
the
state
of
things
and
with
a
look
of
gratified
maternal
pride
said
to
tom
but
you
must
forget
your
plate
you
have
had
a
long
ride
you
know
and
have
another
before
you
this
recalled
tom
to
his
senses
and
in
his
straightforward
manly
way
he
finished
the
account
of
the
affair
the
captain
most
ready
said
black
nancy
glancing
out
of
the
window
as
tom
finished
his
repast
farewell
my
boy
said
mcelroy
i
wish
you
success
and
hope
no
harm
will
come
to
you
and
tom
went
out
and
mounted
the
horse
that
had
been
provided
for
him
and
shaking
hands
with
the
kind
settler
who
brought
him
there
he
saw
mcelroy
and
alice
waving
their
handkerchiefs
as
he
and
the
men
rode
in
military
order
out
of
the
square
the
horses
were
in
good
order
and
the
men
in
fine
spirits
glad
after
their
idle
life
within
the
fort
to
be
sent
on
active
duty
the
day
was
almost
cloudless
the
air
pure
and
bracing
and
they
coursed
the
smooth
prairies
at
a
rapid
rate
yet
to
tom
anxious
heart
the
moments
seemed
long
and
when
they
stopped
at
noon
for
refreshment
and
to
bait
the
horses
tom
could
scarcely
brook
the
delay
he
was
really
on
his
way
with
a
brave
band
for
the
rescue
the
thought
of
this
was
joyful
to
him
yet
he
was
afraid
that
they
might
arrive
too
late
and
as
the
soldiers
lay
upon
the
grass
eating
their
rations
captain
manly
reading
his
feelings
said
to
him
be
patient
my
dear
boy
be
patient
the
old
saying
and
provender
hinder
no
man
journey
is
as
true
in
war
as
in
peace
he
was
a
christian
soldier
and
he
added
we
must
pray
tom
that
god
will
prosper
us
by
this
bit
of
rest
the
men
and
horses
will
be
all
the
better
for
service
when
we
catch
up
with
the
savages
and
if
god
shall
so
order
it
we
will
save
such
of
the
poor
settlers
as
have
escaped
from
massacre
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
they
drew
near
one
of
the
settlements
that
lay
in
their
path
scouts
were
sent
ahead
to
see
if
any
indians
were
lurking
in
the
vicinity
they
reported
that
none
were
to
be
seen
but
that
the
village
had
been
totally
destroyed
putting
spurs
to
their
horses
the
eager
soldiers
were
soon
on
the
ground
the
air
was
still
heavy
with
the
smell
of
the
burning
and
as
they
passed
along
they
saw
that
every
cabin
had
been
consumed
it
was
a
scene
of
utter
desolation
the
horses
feet
splashed
in
pools
of
clotted
blood
while
ever
and
anon
they
came
to
the
mutilated
remains
of
some
victim
of
the
massacre
in
one
place
lay
the
form
of
a
brawny
pioneer
his
broken
rifle
still
clutched
by
the
muzzle
while
the
ground
around
him
was
torn
up
by
the
mighty
struggle
he
had
made
with
his
assailants
here
young
children
had
been
murdered
by
being
dashed
against
a
tree
to
an
oak
near
by
a
woman
had
been
nailed
while
yet
alive
all
the
corpses
were
horribly
mangled
and
disfigured
indignities
the
most
fiendish
being
heaped
upon
them
their
ears
and
noses
were
cut
off
sticks
were
thrust
into
their
eyes
and
their
mouths
were
filled
with
filth
these
awful
sights
wrought
up
the
soldiers
to
frenzy
tom
passions
rose
also
but
he
was
startled
by
the
deadly
paleness
that
sat
upon
the
countenances
of
the
others
so
expressive
of
intensified
hate
and
desire
for
revenge
but
the
scouts
again
appeared
and
reported
a
large
force
of
indians
encamped
before
a
log
house
a
few
miles
farther
on
and
captain
manly
decided
to
strike
for
a
piece
of
woods
to
the
right
of
the
savages
when
the
woods
were
reached
it
was
discovered
that
all
the
dwellings
on
either
side
of
the
besieged
cabin
comprising
three
promising
young
villages
had
been
swept
away
cautiously
the
little
company
pushed
on
to
the
scene
of
action
before
the
lone
cabin
were
assembled
hundreds
of
indians
engaged
in
some
savage
ceremony
they
have
taken
a
captive
whispered
captain
manly
and
have
brought
him
near
the
cabin
to
tantalize
the
inmates
hoping
to
induce
them
to
make
a
sortie
for
the
rescue
of
the
prisoner
it
is
long
hair
replied
tom
wild
with
excitement
be
quiet
be
quiet
my
boy
replied
the
captain
we
be
in
long
hair
before
they
get
his
if
they
do
look
sharp
then
dividing
his
force
into
four
companies
of
ten
men
each
and
directing
them
to
crawl
carefully
through
the
long
grass
to
the
points
he
designated
near
the
foe
he
instructed
each
man
to
be
sure
of
his
aim
and
fire
when
the
captain
division
fired
the
indians
had
been
so
successful
in
their
attacks
on
the
settlements
thus
far
and
so
unmolested
in
their
barbarities
that
they
were
now
completely
off
their
guard
which
enabled
the
whites
to
get
close
to
them
unobserved
tom
eyes
were
fastened
upon
long
hair
the
faithful
handsome
face
betrayed
no
fear
but
it
was
evident
that
he
had
given
up
all
hopes
of
deliverance
with
eagle
eye
he
watched
the
ceremonies
and
as
he
saw
them
approach
their
fatal
termination
began
to
chant
his
captain
manly
understood
indian
customs
and
telling
certain
of
his
men
to
make
sure
of
the
savages
nearest
long
hair
he
gave
the
signal
and
the
bullets
of
the
ten
unerring
marksmen
mowing
them
down
firing
from
the
other
detachments
following
with
deadly
effect
the
panic
of
the
indians
was
indescribable
for
the
firing
from
so
extended
a
line
gave
the
impression
of
a
much
larger
force
than
had
really
attacked
them
their
confusion
was
increased
also
at
seeing
some
soldiers
issue
from
the
woods
mounted
for
the
captain
had
given
orders
in
case
there
was
a
panic
for
a
portion
of
the
command
quietly
and
quickly
to
take
to
their
horses
and
pursue
the
fugitives
thinking
themselves
attacked
by
superior
numbers
of
both
cavalry
and
infantry
the
indians
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
soldiers
who
shot
and
sabred
them
with
small
opposition
as
soon
as
captain
manly
saw
the
effect
of
the
first
volley
he
said
to
tom
i
shall
leave
long
hair
in
your
charge
for
with
delicate
magnanimity
he
would
have
tom
be
the
deliverer
of
the
noble
indian
who
had
perilled
his
life
for
tom
the
lad
needed
no
second
hint
but
sprang
away
and
severed
the
thongs
that
bound
his
indian
friend
to
the
ugh
tom
good
friend
big
ejaculated
the
grateful
indian
are
father
and
mother
safe
asked
tom
in
cabin
there
replied
long
hair
tom
hurried
forward
towards
the
dwelling
but
long
hair
seized
him
saying
maybe
they
think
you
injun
shoot
you
for
his
keen
eye
had
caught
sight
of
the
muzzle
of
a
gun
pointing
at
them
from
out
an
aperture
in
the
building
white
chief
come
soon
he
immediately
added
they
no
fire
at
you
see
gun
gone
scarcely
had
he
uttered
these
words
when
the
outer
door
opened
and
tom
saw
his
mother
standing
there
for
she
had
discerned
him
in
the
deepening
twilight
and
recognized
him
as
her
son
tom
with
a
bound
hastened
to
her
and
as
she
folded
him
in
her
arms
and
tenderly
kissed
him
he
inquired
but
where
is
father
speak
softly
she
replied
as
she
led
the
way
to
a
bed
in
a
corner
of
the
inner
building
on
which
lay
jones
he
is
wounded
said
she
mournfully
and
is
sleeping
now
we
can
not
yet
tell
how
it
will
turn
with
him
but
hope
for
the
best
but
where
are
the
other
men
asked
tom
weeping
for
only
a
few
women
and
children
were
in
sight
they
deserted
us
night
before
last
our
provisions
had
run
low
and
the
savages
had
retired
to
make
us
think
they
had
left
and
the
men
half
crazed
with
sleepless
nights
and
scanty
food
were
deluded
by
the
idea
that
they
might
get
safely
away
and
perhaps
bring
us
aid
but
poor
things
they
were
not
themselves
and
they
had
gone
only
a
few
rods
when
they
were
set
upon
by
the
savages
and
brutally
slaughtered
before
our
eyes
we
used
our
guns
on
the
indians
as
well
as
we
could
but
found
it
difficult
to
prevent
them
from
scaling
the
building
did
fire
upon
them
asked
tom
wonderingly
yes
my
son
said
she
gently
and
last
night
knowing
how
feeble
our
force
must
be
they
were
emboldened
to
attempt
to
burn
the
house
the
roof
caught
in
several
places
and
your
father
went
up
and
put
out
the
fire
at
the
risk
of
his
life
it
was
then
that
he
was
shot
he
had
been
our
main
defence
from
the
first
for
the
indians
were
more
afraid
of
his
rifle
than
a
dozen
of
others
but
how
did
you
get
along
after
father
was
disabled
we
women
loaded
watched
and
fired
by
turns
i
do
not
see
how
we
could
have
held
out
an
hour
longer
help
came
just
in
time
but
where
are
all
the
children
inquired
tom
forebodingly
jones
gave
a
low
moan
as
if
her
heart
would
break
but
with
wonderful
suppressed
all
other
manifestations
of
emotion
and
said
lovingly
laying
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
my
son
we
are
a
broken
family
we
shall
never
all
meet
again
on
earth
charlie
disappeared
at
the
first
attack
i
did
not
see
him
killed
and
you
know
what
a
quick
active
boy
he
is
and
he
may
have
escaped
although
the
chances
were
fearfully
against
him
sarah
was
overtaken
by
an
indian
and
tomahawked
while
flying
home
from
the
store
and
bub
sobbed
tom
that
was
one
of
the
crudest
of
the
cruelties
connected
with
the
outbreak
there
was
an
indian
who
made
great
professions
of
friendship
visiting
our
cabin
almost
daily
you
saw
him
tom
when
you
visited
us
we
treated
him
very
kindly
and
made
him
many
presents
he
seemed
to
have
a
particular
liking
to
bub
and
bub
was
fond
of
him
and
would
always
run
to
meet
him
when
he
saw
him
coming
the
day
of
the
fatal
attack
he
made
his
appearance
as
usual
and
bub
with
an
exclamation
of
joy
hastened
to
be
the
first
to
greet
him
when
as
the
child
drew
laughingly
near
the
treacherous
savage
raised
his
rifle
and
shot
him
through
the
head
this
was
the
signal
for
the
assault
sarah
was
standing
at
the
time
in
the
store
door
opposite
and
seeing
the
murder
started
for
the
house
her
face
terribly
pale
with
fright
so
terrified
was
she
that
it
seemed
as
if
she
flew
rather
than
ran
but
the
same
savage
swiftly
pursued
her
and
being
nearer
the
house
than
she
struck
her
down
with
his
tomahawk
but
robert
has
been
left
to
us
and
a
brave
good
boy
has
he
been
tom
was
so
absorbed
that
he
had
not
noticed
the
quiet
entrance
of
captain
manly
and
others
of
the
command
who
seated
or
standing
around
the
room
listened
intently
to
his
mother
account
of
the
massacre
as
she
concluded
the
captain
said
i
had
taken
the
precaution
madam
to
bring
the
surgeon
along
with
me
and
if
you
desire
it
he
will
examine
your
husband
wounds
and
see
what
is
best
to
be
done
for
him
at
which
the
doctor
stepped
forward
and
proceeded
to
probe
and
dress
the
wound
it
is
an
ugly
hurt
remarked
the
surgeon
but
by
good
care
and
nursing
he
may
rally
just
what
are
impossible
answered
the
captain
in
this
place
would
it
do
to
remove
him
doctor
if
a
good
litter
was
prepared
was
the
reply
there
would
be
less
risk
in
doing
so
than
in
leaving
him
in
this
wretched
hole
particularly
added
the
captain
as
the
would
be
sure
to
come
back
to
finish
their
fiendish
work
and
i
would
propose
madam
that
after
my
men
have
taken
a
little
rest
we
remove
you
and
your
family
at
once
to
the
fort
where
you
shall
receive
the
best
of
attention
and
everything
be
done
for
your
husband
that
skill
and
medicine
and
needful
comforts
can
do
for
his
recovery
jones
glanced
at
the
ghastly
wound
of
her
husband
i
understand
your
feelings
said
the
captain
kindly
but
you
have
shown
that
you
are
a
brave
woman
ever
ready
to
do
what
is
for
the
best
now
the
indians
were
some
three
or
four
hundred
strong
and
as
they
were
some
of
them
must
have
discovered
that
i
have
but
a
handful
of
men
they
will
return
in
larger
force
thirsting
for
revenge
it
is
therefore
indispensable
that
we
take
jones
with
us
it
is
all
we
can
do
under
the
circumstances
jones
saw
the
propriety
of
this
and
gratefully
assented
to
the
captain
plan
and
at
the
hour
appointed
all
the
preparations
having
been
efficiently
made
the
wounded
man
was
carefully
placed
upon
the
litter
the
women
and
children
taken
upon
the
soldiers
horses
and
the
little
cavalcade
moved
noiselessly
out
on
the
prairie
chapter
xvii
the
mysterious
fire
few
words
were
spoken
as
the
handful
of
brave
men
with
the
rescued
women
and
children
and
the
suffering
squatter
moved
on
experienced
scouts
were
thrown
out
on
either
hand
to
give
notice
of
danger
for
at
any
moment
the
wily
foe
might
spring
upon
them
where
can
long
hair
be
whispered
tom
to
his
mother
i
can
not
imagine
she
answered
he
left
the
cabin
as
i
was
telling
you
about
the
loss
of
the
children
through
the
treachery
of
yellow
bank
his
eyes
glared
while
i
was
speaking
and
there
was
a
look
on
his
face
that
i
could
not
interpret
do
you
suppose
he
is
trusty
trusty
echoed
tom
why
mother
he
perilled
his
life
for
us
yes
i
know
it
child
he
is
unlike
any
indian
i
ever
saw
but
why
did
he
leave
so
mysteriously
i
do
know
replied
tom
captain
manly
tried
to
find
him
he
wished
to
present
him
to
general
mcelroy
he
said
he
did
not
doubt
that
government
would
reward
long
hair
for
his
services
well
sighed
his
mother
shuddering
as
she
spoke
how
different
these
indians
are
from
us
they
come
and
go
so
noiselessly
and
talk
so
little
but
what
is
that
she
exclaimed
glancing
back
what
inquired
tom
why
that
light
pointing
in
the
direction
from
which
they
came
and
tom
saw
against
the
dark
woods
for
a
background
thick
flying
sparks
from
the
cabin
chimney
made
themselves
visible
for
miles
across
the
prairie
a
scout
now
rode
up
to
call
the
attention
of
the
captain
to
the
same
appearance
i
can
not
comprehend
it
ejaculated
that
officer
putting
his
glass
to
his
eyes
it
is
clear
that
the
cabin
is
not
on
fire
it
seems
to
be
occupied
and
riding
up
to
jones
he
said
madam
can
you
tell
me
if
there
was
any
fuel
in
the
fireplace
when
we
left
there
was
not
was
the
decided
reply
but
there
is
a
large
fire
burning
on
the
hearth
now
how
do
you
account
for
that
it
a
trick
of
the
savages
he
muttered
as
he
put
spurs
to
his
steed
and
yet
he
added
it
is
not
like
the
indians
to
go
into
a
house
and
make
a
fire
if
they
had
discovered
our
retreat
they
would
be
too
cunning
thus
to
let
us
know
that
they
had
found
it
out
we
should
see
them
prowling
around
as
stealthily
as
so
many
panthers
somebody
alive
and
stirring
there
who
can
it
be
the
singular
incident
served
to
heighten
the
anxiety
of
all
and
stimulate
the
soldiers
to
make
as
good
progress
as
they
could
without
too
greatly
distressing
the
wounded
man
several
times
in
the
dim
light
the
groaning
and
pallor
of
her
husband
led
jones
to
fear
he
was
dying
and
with
tom
and
robert
she
watched
every
change
in
his
appearance
tenderly
ministering
to
him
fresh
relays
of
men
took
the
places
of
those
who
bore
him
taking
their
turn
at
the
litter
with
alacrity
for
tom
dutiful
and
heroic
conduct
and
the
loving
gentleness
and
patient
endurance
and
the
squatter
stubborn
defence
of
the
lone
cabin
against
such
odds
had
won
the
hearts
of
the
soldiers
and
they
had
resolved
to
see
the
family
safe
within
the
walls
of
the
fortress
or
if
attacked
on
the
prairie
to
defend
them
to
the
death
how
did
it
happen
asked
captain
manly
in
a
low
voice
of
the
mother
that
your
cabin
was
enclosed
with
those
walls
of
heavy
logs
were
you
expecting
an
attack
long
hair
gave
us
warning
she
replied
and
husband
persuaded
the
settlers
to
cut
down
trees
and
build
the
walls
and
your
husband
directed
the
defence
yes
said
she
and
he
made
a
sortie
and
rescued
a
number
of
neighbors
who
would
otherwise
have
been
murdered
the
very
persons
who
afterwards
deserted
in
the
night
leaving
in
their
haste
the
outer
door
wide
open
we
should
all
have
been
sacrificed
before
morning
had
we
not
been
startled
at
seeing
long
hair
standing
in
the
cabin
how
he
got
in
undiscovered
through
so
many
enemies
and
notified
us
of
our
danger
in
so
timely
a
manner
we
could
not
conjecture
husband
secured
the
door
again
and
long
hair
vanished
as
he
came
saying
hair
go
quick
get
sojer
come
right
back
bimeby
quick
that
was
i
suppose
when
he
came
to
the
fort
as
tom
told
us
about
and
not
succeeding
in
his
errand
hurried
to
find
tom
to
intercede
with
you
for
us
you
have
had
a
hard
time
of
it
said
the
captain
and
your
husband
stood
a
siege
before
which
a
fort
might
have
fallen
i
only
hope
that
the
brave
fellow
get
well
and
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
noble
conduct
if
i
had
a
few
hundred
men
like
him
i
could
sweep
the
from
the
soil
but
the
jarring
and
the
motion
and
the
pain
were
proving
too
much
for
the
wounded
pioneer
and
delirium
setting
in
he
began
to
rave
speaking
however
slowly
and
distinctly
and
without
a
tinge
of
the
squatter
dialect
but
in
the
purer
english
of
his
early
days
there
he
exclaimed
pointing
his
finger
you
come
again
i
knew
you
would
not
let
me
rest
he
thinking
of
the
indians
remarked
the
captain
sorrowfully
the
confounded
i
told
you
he
stole
it
all
will
you
harass
me
into
my
grave
a
set
of
vampires
sucking
the
of
an
honest
man
now
he
wanders
said
the
captain
and
sending
for
the
surgeon
the
latter
opened
his
medicine
case
and
lighting
a
match
to
read
the
labels
on
his
vials
administered
an
opiate
and
the
sufferer
sank
into
a
troubled
stupor
ah
whispered
the
mother
to
tom
it
is
not
the
savages
that
disturb
his
mind
so
it
the
old
agony
of
a
wounded
spirit
about
noon
the
next
day
they
came
in
sight
of
the
fort
how
welcome
the
frowning
walls
to
the
weary
women
and
children
how
sublime
seemed
the
national
flag
floating
proudly
on
the
breeze
symbol
of
a
united
sovereignty
of
states
powerful
to
protect
its
citizens
on
the
ocean
and
the
land
in
the
teeming
city
and
in
the
wilds
of
the
wilderness
general
mcelroy
received
the
settlers
in
the
kindest
manner
causing
them
to
feel
at
once
that
they
were
among
friends
airy
quiet
apartments
were
assigned
to
the
wounded
man
and
his
household
and
the
ladies
of
the
garrison
vied
with
each
other
in
their
attentions
to
him
and
his
stricken
family
often
would
mcelroy
come
in
and
sit
by
jones
that
his
wife
might
get
some
rest
with
her
and
her
husband
tom
had
become
a
great
favorite
and
they
entertained
a
high
respect
for
the
mother
the
squatter
life
in
the
open
air
roaming
the
prairies
tended
to
build
up
for
him
a
healthy
physical
organization
favorable
to
the
healing
of
the
wound
and
as
this
progressed
the
doctor
marvelled
that
he
did
not
get
stronger
he
was
strangely
liable
to
delirious
attacks
and
opiates
gradually
lost
their
influence
over
him
one
day
the
surgeon
entered
as
his
patient
wildly
raving
was
exclaiming
with
great
vehemence
i
tell
you
again
that
i
have
nothing
to
pay
with
and
you
will
give
me
no
chance
to
earn
o
what
a
load
to
carry
debt
debt
debt
shall
i
never
find
rest
then
in
a
moment
more
his
thoughts
relapsing
to
another
subject
he
murmured
what
did
the
preacher
say
unto
me
and
i
will
give
you
rest
yes
that
is
what
i
want
o
if
only
i
could
come
the
surgeon
watched
him
through
the
delirium
and
said
madam
it
is
not
the
bullet
of
the
savage
that
killing
your
husband
but
some
more
deadly
sore
he
needs
medicine
for
the
mind
rather
than
the
body
and
when
he
is
himself
you
had
better
call
in
the
chaplain
to
converse
with
him
an
hour
later
when
jones
had
an
easy
interval
she
gently
said
husband
you
are
very
sick
do
you
think
it
might
do
you
good
to
have
a
little
talk
with
the
minister
minister
he
feebly
answered
what
minister
the
minister
that
belongs
to
the
fort
i
do
know
him
replied
the
sick
man
suspiciously
but
there
is
minister
that
i
do
know
he
added
after
a
moment
pause
who
she
inquired
why
he
answered
impatiently
as
if
he
thought
she
ought
to
understand
you
mean
the
missionary
she
returned
yes
if
i
could
talk
with
him
i
would
like
to
the
wife
mentioned
his
remarks
to
the
surgeon
and
general
mcelroy
sent
for
the
missionary
it
was
evening
of
a
lowering
rainy
day
when
the
messenger
returned
with
payson
it
had
been
drizzling
and
dripping
all
day
but
towards
night
the
clouds
grew
black
and
wild
and
a
furious
wind
dashed
the
big
violently
against
the
window
the
air
was
raw
and
seemed
to
pierce
to
the
bones
the
old
fort
buildings
were
delightful
in
fair
weather
but
now
were
damp
and
chilly
jones
feared
for
the
effect
of
the
storm
on
her
husband
whose
frame
since
his
wound
had
been
extremely
sensitive
to
atmospheric
changes
and
dreading
that
if
he
was
disturbed
he
would
relapse
into
delirium
she
concluded
not
to
invite
the
missionary
in
to
see
him
until
morning
she
had
disposed
everything
as
comfortably
as
possible
about
the
bed
and
had
a
nourishing
broth
and
his
medicines
handy
when
mcelroy
entered
and
said
you
look
worn
out
go
and
take
a
nap
now
and
if
you
are
needed
i
will
call
you
you
know
the
missionary
is
here
and
will
wish
to
be
with
him
in
the
morning
and
it
is
desirable
that
you
should
feel
as
well
as
you
can
to
encourage
your
husband
jones
thus
charged
retired
to
an
adjoining
room
thinking
to
rest
herself
for
a
short
time
and
then
return
she
felt
that
a
great
event
was
impending
and
thought
it
impossible
for
her
to
close
her
eyes
but
so
utterly
exhausted
was
she
that
she
immediately
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
from
which
she
was
awakened
at
midnight
by
mcelroy
who
said
a
great
change
has
come
over
your
husband
i
think
he
is
going
to
get
well
he
wants
to
see
you
and
the
boys
hurrying
to
her
husband
side
she
found
him
sitting
up
in
bed
as
composedly
as
if
no
trouble
had
ever
disturbed
the
serenity
of
his
mind
looking
much
as
he
did
in
their
bridal
hour
he
had
called
for
a
bowl
of
water
and
a
towel
and
was
calmly
washing
himself
bestowing
on
her
a
loving
look
as
she
entered
he
asked
mary
dear
has
the
missionary
come
yes
she
replied
can
i
see
him
now
mcelroy
took
out
her
watch
and
said
pleasantly
are
you
particular
about
seeing
him
now
i
suppose
you
are
not
aware
how
late
it
is
yes
he
answered
it
is
twelve
and
his
eye
shone
with
a
strange
intelligence
i
should
have
sent
for
him
a
year
ago
had
not
my
heart
been
so
proud
and
bitter
but
i
know
he
come
now
if
it
is
late
there
was
something
unearthly
in
his
manner
and
mcelroy
said
rising
it
shall
be
as
you
request
as
payson
entered
the
sick
man
extended
his
hand
saying
i
almost
through
my
friend
i
had
some
sore
trials
in
life
not
so
much
on
my
own
account
as
because
of
those
who
were
too
dear
to
me
we
were
cruelly
wronged
and
i
have
not
been
quite
right
here
placing
his
hand
upon
his
forehead
and
what
has
made
it
worse
i
have
been
all
wrong
here
laying
his
hand
upon
his
heart
i
have
doubted
everybody
and
distrusted
my
god
i
have
been
hard
and
scornful
and
hated
my
fellows
but
it
is
different
with
me
now
i
have
heard
that
voice
speaking
to
me
that
you
told
us
of
in
the
little
cabin
he
has
said
unto
me
even
me
and
he
has
given
me
i
have
had
a
long
long
struggle
but
the
conflict
is
over
ah
he
is
so
different
from
human
creditors
i
have
been
a
poor
debtor
chased
hunted
oppressed
goaded
almost
to
insanity
and
none
took
pity
on
me
because
i
owed
them
a
few
paltry
dollars
which
i
had
the
heart
to
pay
but
through
the
robberies
of
another
and
their
oppressions
could
not
but
what
a
debt
i
owed
my
savior
yet
without
a
word
of
reproach
he
has
forgiven
me
all
this
was
spoken
with
a
wondrous
energy
and
clearness
of
voice
but
a
deathly
paleness
began
to
overspread
his
face
partial
delirium
supervened
not
raging
as
before
but
his
features
lighted
up
the
while
with
a
smile
of
heavenly
beauty
and
repeating
again
his
voice
sinking
to
a
whisper
what
did
the
preacher
say
unto
me
and
i
will
give
you
rest
rest
rest
it
is
mine
his
spirit
was
gone
chapter
xviii
the
boy
in
the
tree
charlie
was
a
boy
who
naturally
loved
adventure
he
was
excitable
and
yet
had
a
reserved
power
which
in
great
emergencies
made
him
cool
and
brave
he
was
fertile
in
expedients
and
when
aroused
experienced
a
rollicking
enjoyment
in
danger
in
the
little
settlement
he
came
across
an
old
copy
of
robinson
crusoe
and
charmed
with
its
romantic
descriptions
conceived
the
idea
of
becoming
another
crusoe
but
there
was
a
serious
obstacle
in
his
way
he
could
not
convert
a
prairie
into
an
ocean
and
get
shipwrecked
yet
if
he
lacked
salt
water
there
was
many
a
man
friday
at
hand
for
he
mentally
promoted
every
friendly
indian
to
that
office
and
there
were
plenty
of
cannibals
in
the
shape
of
disaffected
indians
who
were
already
threatening
the
settlements
with
depredation
and
carnage
now
charlie
to
enjoy
his
book
under
congenial
circumstances
and
where
he
would
not
be
interrupted
by
his
mother
saying
charlie
bring
some
wood
and
charlie
get
some
water
and
the
various
of
domestic
duty
to
which
boys
of
his
age
and
active
habits
are
liable
looked
about
for
some
safe
retreat
and
chanced
to
find
one
day
in
the
woods
near
at
hand
a
large
hollow
tree
many
a
time
had
he
passed
it
and
not
discovered
the
welcome
fact
the
entrance
was
effectually
concealed
by
a
tangled
clump
of
bushes
had
they
taken
it
specially
in
hand
to
grow
in
such
a
way
as
to
hide
the
hole
in
the
tree
they
could
not
have
done
it
more
thoroughly
and
nobody
but
a
prying
young
crusoe
of
charlie
qualifications
would
have
spied
out
the
entrance
having
discovered
it
he
would
creep
slyly
in
and
by
means
of
the
light
let
in
through
a
hole
higher
up
in
the
trunk
would
pore
over
the
haps
and
mishaps
of
the
juan
fernandez
hero
and
imitate
his
achievements
as
well
as
he
could
it
got
to
be
a
great
mystery
what
became
of
charlie
through
the
long
hours
of
the
day
he
could
hear
and
see
much
of
what
passed
around
him
and
with
imperturbable
gravity
would
sit
in
his
sly
retreat
making
no
answer
while
his
mother
would
come
to
the
cabin
door
and
call
in
silvery
treble
charlie
charlie
where
are
you
charlie
and
then
in
turn
the
father
would
make
his
appearance
and
shout
in
masculine
bass
charlie
charlie
your
mother
wants
yer
why
do
you
come
after
a
while
sarah
would
be
despatched
to
search
for
him
and
her
girlish
voice
would
repeat
the
parents
calls
as
she
looked
everywhere
in
vain
then
when
he
returned
to
the
house
to
the
accustomed
inquiry
why
where
have
you
been
we
been
calling
you
and
hunting
everywhere
for
you
he
would
reply
with
the
utmost
nonchalance
o
only
out
here
at
which
sarah
would
retort
impatiently
i
know
better
than
that
for
i
hunted
all
round
for
you
and
you
was
anywhere
to
be
seen
and
charlie
respond
with
compassionate
condescension
pooh
girls
are
great
at
hunting
now
it
was
very
wrong
in
charlie
to
be
so
dumb
when
his
parents
wanted
him
and
to
cause
them
so
much
concern
by
his
unexplained
absence
but
he
justified
it
to
his
own
conscience
on
the
ground
that
it
was
in
keeping
with
his
character
as
second
crusoe
robinson
crusoe
in
his
estimation
was
the
greatest
and
most
glorious
man
that
ever
lived
charlie
had
taken
him
for
his
model
in
life
and
it
would
derogate
from
the
dignity
of
his
position
while
enacting
the
man
crusoe
monarch
of
all
he
surveyed
to
obey
as
the
child
charlie
he
was
willing
when
in
the
house
to
do
what
was
expected
of
him
as
a
boy
under
subjection
but
when
he
was
in
his
crusoe
cave
the
hollow
tree
he
was
altogether
another
person
and
he
reasoned
in
order
to
have
things
in
harmony
he
must
act
accordingly
charlie
by
some
means
had
come
into
possession
of
a
horse
pistol
considerably
out
of
order
it
is
true
but
it
served
to
fill
the
place
of
one
of
the
two
pistols
robinson
crusoe
found
on
board
the
spanish
ship
he
was
in
daily
expectation
of
finding
another
but
needing
ammunition
to
store
up
against
a
coming
fray
with
the
cannibals
on
the
shore
he
helped
himself
frequently
to
the
contents
of
his
and
what
under
the
canopy
makes
my
powder
go
so
fast
his
father
often
exclaimed
as
he
replenished
the
stock
the
lad
also
begged
ammunition
of
the
settlers
and
by
these
means
he
laid
up
a
surprisingly
large
amount
of
warlike
munitions
kept
securely
in
an
old
skin
bag
he
had
also
dried
venison
stowed
away
and
a
good
store
of
nuts
with
for
parching
and
potatoes
for
roasting
all
against
some
coming
time
of
need
now
it
chanced
that
charlie
turned
to
good
account
as
it
saved
his
curly
scalp
for
the
afternoon
of
the
indian
outbreak
with
one
eye
on
the
crusoe
history
and
the
other
watching
to
see
if
any
cannibals
landed
on
the
shore
taking
an
occasional
sip
from
an
old
filled
with
spring
water
which
he
called
goat
milk
the
whole
frightful
scene
of
the
massacre
passed
before
him
he
saw
dear
little
bub
run
to
meet
yellow
bank
and
he
also
saw
what
his
mother
did
not
in
the
panic
that
just
as
the
treacherous
savage
fired
the
little
fellow
tripped
and
fell
unharmed
by
the
bullet
he
saw
at
that
instant
his
sister
sarah
start
from
the
store
for
the
cabin
and
that
the
fiendish
savage
did
not
notice
bub
escape
in
his
eagerness
to
intercept
the
girl
so
that
bub
terrified
by
the
report
of
the
gun
and
at
seeing
his
sister
struck
down
by
yellow
bank
dragged
himself
off
in
the
direction
of
charlie
tree
not
seeming
to
know
but
that
he
was
going
towards
the
cabin
he
saw
the
door
of
the
cabin
closed
and
that
preparations
were
made
to
keep
out
the
savages
and
that
the
whole
attention
of
the
indians
was
turned
on
assaulting
the
house
so
cautiously
creeping
out
and
placing
one
hand
firmly
over
bub
mouth
to
prevent
him
from
making
a
sound
he
drew
him
into
the
tree
he
was
fully
aware
that
he
did
this
at
the
risk
of
his
own
life
for
if
the
child
made
an
outcry
their
would
be
discovered
and
they
would
both
be
sacrificed
but
he
had
too
loving
and
noble
a
nature
to
save
his
own
life
by
leaving
his
darling
pet
brother
exposed
charlie
found
it
a
difficult
task
to
control
himself
sufficiently
in
the
scenes
that
were
passing
before
him
to
keep
guard
over
bub
each
instant
as
he
must
to
prevent
him
from
revealing
their
place
of
refuge
the
little
fellow
had
received
a
terrible
fright
and
at
first
struggled
with
singular
strength
to
free
himself
from
charlie
grasp
and
charlie
arms
ached
from
the
constant
strain
in
holding
him
his
efforts
however
were
rewarded
at
last
by
bub
beginning
to
comprehend
the
case
it
the
wicked
indians
whispered
charlie
and
they
kill
us
if
we
make
any
noise
three
days
and
nights
came
and
went
how
thankful
charlie
was
for
the
provisions
and
water
which
he
had
unwittingly
provided
for
this
fearful
hour
he
had
the
good
sense
however
to
be
careful
of
the
water
for
he
knew
not
how
long
he
must
stay
there
and
he
taught
bub
to
eat
very
slowly
as
he
had
heard
his
father
say
that
the
hunters
did
so
on
the
plains
to
prevent
thirst
it
was
a
terrible
ordeal
for
a
boy
of
his
tender
years
to
witness
the
horrid
sights
transpiring
around
him
and
then
when
the
neighboring
cabins
were
fired
he
was
filled
with
fear
lest
the
cinders
would
set
the
tree
ablaze
charlie
hoped
through
all
this
long
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
take
refuge
with
his
father
and
mother
in
the
cabin
but
the
savages
lay
encamped
around
him
and
several
times
an
indian
crept
upon
his
hands
and
knees
and
fired
from
behind
the
tree
at
the
inmates
of
the
cabin
three
days
and
nights
how
long
they
were
to
the
children
in
the
tree
and
yet
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
they
might
not
remain
there
as
much
longer
provided
the
defence
of
the
cabin
continued
as
persistently
as
it
had
done
there
was
still
a
good
supply
of
food
although
the
potatoes
had
to
be
eaten
raw
but
the
water
grew
nauseating
and
if
some
more
could
not
be
obtained
what
would
they
do
bub
began
to
be
tormented
with
thirst
and
once
attempted
to
cry
for
water
he
had
borne
up
like
a
hero
controlled
by
his
fears
sometimes
seeming
to
forget
his
own
wants
and
perils
in
his
baby
concern
for
his
parents
will
the
wicked
indians
kill
father
and
mother
he
once
asked
his
blue
eyes
wide
with
horror
and
voice
too
loud
for
prudence
just
as
a
savage
was
creeping
up
to
take
aim
from
behind
the
tree
so
that
charlie
had
to
guard
him
with
ceaseless
vigilance
but
thirst
how
could
he
expect
that
a
little
boy
like
bub
could
long
endure
its
torments
without
making
his
agony
known
i
want
some
water
hoarsely
whispered
bub
i
dry
well
do
make
any
noise
and
charlie
get
you
some
so
waiting
till
after
nightfall
charlie
put
his
head
cautiously
out
of
the
hole
and
peered
around
the
spring
was
not
far
off
but
charlie
knew
that
the
savages
would
be
likely
to
guard
that
and
he
did
not
venture
to
draw
his
whole
body
from
the
aperture
save
with
the
utmost
caution
and
very
slowly
satisfying
himself
that
the
indians
were
not
noticing
the
tree
he
drew
himself
completely
out
and
then
putting
his
head
in
again
whispered
now
bub
do
you
move
nor
stir
while
i
go
for
the
water
i
be
back
in
a
minute
the
heroic
boy
might
have
been
taken
in
the
darkness
for
an
overgrown
caterpillar
he
crawled
so
softly
towards
the
spring
he
knew
that
if
he
broke
a
stick
or
twig
or
inadvertently
hit
his
against
an
obstacle
the
quick
ear
of
the
indian
would
be
sure
to
detect
it
and
yet
he
was
surprised
at
his
own
coolness
and
mastery
of
himself
and
he
accomplished
the
feat
returning
with
the
black
old
pot
filled
to
the
brim
he
had
got
within
a
few
feet
of
the
tree
when
in
range
of
the
opening
he
saw
a
figure
apparently
watching
him
charlie
thought
his
hour
had
come
that
it
was
a
savage
ready
with
his
and
had
given
up
all
for
lost
when
the
dark
form
moved
from
out
the
shadow
towards
him
and
to
his
consternation
he
saw
that
it
was
bub
who
trudged
forward
saying
in
a
loud
whisper
has
oo
dot
any
water
charlie
to
save
further
noise
chose
the
bold
alternative
of
letting
him
drink
on
the
spot
and
retaining
his
prostrate
condition
quickly
put
the
pot
to
bub
lips
and
the
child
swallowed
great
draughts
with
satisfied
gutturals
that
seemed
to
charlie
apprehensive
ear
like
the
reports
of
pocket
pistols
he
let
him
drink
his
fill
however
then
pulling
him
down
by
his
chubby
legs
thrust
him
swiftly
but
softly
through
the
aperture
following
as
fast
as
he
could
and
keeping
perfectly
still
for
a
full
hour
before
he
dared
venture
forth
again
for
the
which
he
was
obliged
to
leave
behind
the
vigilance
of
their
father
in
the
defence
of
the
cabin
not
only
kept
the
children
in
the
tree
longer
than
charlie
bargained
for
when
he
turned
in
on
that
memorable
afternoon
to
play
crusoe
but
also
put
their
lives
in
jeopardy
from
their
father
bullets
for
as
we
have
said
before
the
tree
being
a
large
one
and
conveniently
near
the
cabin
the
savages
would
creep
up
behind
it
to
shoot
from
which
would
be
sure
to
bring
a
dangerous
response
and
charlie
was
obliged
to
know
more
than
once
that
the
tree
was
perforated
by
balls
from
his
father
rifle
at
such
times
the
youngsters
kept
as
close
to
the
ground
as
possible
when
the
indians
set
fire
to
the
roof
of
the
cabin
charlie
was
almost
wild
with
excitement
fearing
that
his
parents
would
now
be
burned
to
death
nor
was
his
anxiety
lessened
when
he
saw
his
father
ascend
the
roof
to
extinguish
the
flames
thus
exposing
himself
to
the
deadly
aim
of
the
foe
captain
manly
attack
however
he
did
not
understand
for
the
soldiers
did
not
pass
near
the
tree
and
the
confusion
and
clamor
the
horrid
yells
that
rent
the
air
and
the
tramp
of
the
contending
parties
in
the
dim
twilight
seemed
like
the
chaos
of
a
whirlwind
the
fight
was
so
sudden
and
so
soon
over
and
he
dared
not
leave
the
tree
after
the
battle
not
knowing
what
it
all
meant
he
had
a
bewildered
idea
that
there
had
been
an
attack
on
the
indians
by
a
party
of
whites
but
which
had
been
victorious
he
could
not
tell
so
he
watched
on
trying
to
determine
this
point
until
late
in
the
night
when
he
saw
a
dark
body
moving
cautiously
from
the
cabin
the
indians
have
taken
the
cabin
he
concluded
and
now
burn
our
house
as
they
did
the
others
and
yet
it
puzzled
him
to
see
how
closely
together
the
savages
kept
instead
of
being
scattered
about
in
all
directions
as
they
were
before
he
could
see
them
moving
quietly
away
and
thought
some
of
them
were
mounted
on
their
ponies
after
they
were
well
out
of
sight
resting
bub
head
against
the
skin
for
the
little
fellow
overcome
by
weariness
had
fallen
asleep
he
crawled
from
his
and
reconnoitred
suddenly
he
stumbled
over
a
dead
indian
lying
with
his
rifle
beside
him
and
soon
he
came
across
another
but
all
was
still
in
the
cabin
there
has
been
a
battle
said
charlie
to
himself
exultantly
and
the
indians
are
driven
away
and
he
entered
the
house
all
was
dark
and
quiet
so
feeling
his
way
to
the
chimney
he
raked
open
the
ashes
and
found
a
few
sparks
going
out
he
gathered
twigs
and
limbs
and
heaping
them
on
the
hearth
blew
them
into
a
blaze
then
running
to
the
tree
he
awakened
bub
and
hurried
him
to
the
cabin
and
returned
for
his
crusoe
provisions
and
ammunition
where
father
and
mother
asked
bub
looking
round
in
dismay
i
think
said
charlie
soothingly
with
a
profound
air
that
the
settlers
have
got
together
and
driven
off
the
indians
and
taken
our
folks
where
they
be
safe
and
now
bub
we
live
here
like
robinson
crusoe
on
the
island
and
you
shall
be
my
friday
till
our
folks
come
back
for
you
see
they
find
out
that
we
ai
with
them
and
they
come
and
take
us
away
ca
we
go
where
our
folks
is
now
inquired
bub
beginning
to
cry
it
so
dark
we
ca
find
them
said
charlie
wo
the
indians
come
and
hurt
us
charlie
started
at
the
thought
i
do
know
he
replied
shaking
his
head
doubtfully
be
just
like
them
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
there
a
good
many
indians
been
killed
around
the
house
and
i
just
go
out
and
get
all
the
rifles
i
can
and
then
let
them
try
it
if
they
want
to
why
robinson
crusoe
drove
off
canoes
full
and
i
bet
he
have
so
many
guns
as
i
have
and
hastening
out
he
kept
finding
and
bringing
them
in
until
he
had
a
dozen
now
said
he
i
bring
in
lots
of
wood
and
we
keep
the
fire
crackling
and
he
stirred
the
burning
limbs
to
make
the
sparks
fly
and
if
the
indians
return
they
think
there
a
big
houseful
of
men
in
here
besides
he
added
if
our
folks
see
the
sparks
from
the
chimney
they
know
you
and
i
are
here
and
return
for
us
and
on
the
whole
i
guess
i
rather
go
with
them
than
to
fight
the
cannibals
alone
for
if
i
should
happen
to
be
killed
i
suppose
have
to
eat
me
and
i
rather
not
be
eaten
charlie
brought
from
the
enclosure
a
fine
pile
of
wood
and
a
pail
of
water
then
went
out
to
see
that
the
outer
door
was
secured
and
closed
the
shutter
in
the
room
he
then
proceeded
to
examine
the
rifles
for
he
was
well
versed
in
like
western
boys
generally
and
carefully
cleaned
and
loaded
them
now
said
he
crusoe
had
his
seven
guns
mounted
and
i
mount
my
twelve
fortunately
for
his
scheme
the
places
had
been
already
prepared
after
this
was
done
he
went
down
into
the
cellar
to
see
if
there
was
anything
to
eat
and
finding
some
food
he
returned
and
hanging
the
over
the
fire
he
poured
some
boiling
water
upon
the
in
the
then
set
the
table
for
himself
and
bub
and
assigning
bub
one
chair
and
getting
another
for
himself
said
we
might
as
well
live
like
folks
as
long
as
we
are
out
of
the
tree
then
having
finished
their
repast
he
said
i
feel
tired
it
so
long
since
i
had
a
good
sleep
so
i
guess
we
better
go
to
bed
and
lying
down
upon
the
bed
in
the
corner
with
an
arm
lovingly
clasping
little
bub
they
sank
into
the
sweet
sleep
of
childhood
chapter
xix
bub
broadside
it
was
nine
next
morning
when
charlie
awoke
much
refreshed
some
moments
elapsed
before
he
could
recollect
where
he
was
and
how
he
came
there
then
hastening
first
to
the
through
which
his
guns
were
pointed
he
scanned
the
field
on
all
sides
to
see
if
any
enemy
was
in
view
the
result
being
satisfactory
he
commenced
preparations
for
breakfast
for
bub
was
now
awake
and
hungry
as
a
starved
kitten
i
tell
you
what
said
he
to
bub
as
they
ate
their
morning
meal
i
got
a
jolly
plan
for
us
i
going
to
dig
a
cave
in
the
cellar
so
that
if
the
indians
get
into
the
cabin
we
could
hide
there
just
as
we
did
in
the
tree
and
you
have
some
water
in
there
for
me
to
drink
suggested
bub
yes
answered
charlie
we
have
everything
that
we
want
so
assuring
himself
by
another
examination
that
matters
outside
wore
a
peaceful
aspect
he
repaired
to
the
cellar
to
commence
the
excavation
luckily
for
charlie
plan
the
cellar
walls
had
been
carelessly
constructed
and
in
a
corner
he
found
a
stone
that
he
could
remove
from
its
place
in
the
foundation
without
disturbing
the
others
taking
this
out
with
the
iron
he
soon
had
drawn
forth
a
large
quantity
of
the
loose
sand
now
observed
charlie
to
bub
you
must
take
the
shovel
and
throw
the
sand
about
the
cellar
while
i
work
with
my
hands
this
was
quite
an
easy
task
the
sand
was
so
light
and
dry
and
ere
long
he
had
a
place
large
enough
to
conceal
himself
and
bub
but
said
he
i
shall
make
it
extend
farther
in
so
that
if
the
cabin
is
burnt
over
our
heads
it
wo
be
too
hot
for
us
but
bub
made
little
headway
in
shovelling
the
sand
so
charlie
finished
the
job
for
him
and
then
from
a
heap
of
litter
which
he
had
before
taken
the
precaution
to
scrape
into
a
corner
he
took
enough
to
cover
the
fresh
sand
all
over
now
said
he
let
try
our
new
cave
and
squeezing
through
the
hole
from
which
he
had
taken
the
stone
bub
creeping
in
after
him
charlie
reached
out
and
drew
the
stone
into
its
place
again
charlie
was
delighted
i
like
this
he
exclaimed
it
more
like
robinson
cave
bub
thought
he
liked
it
too
but
soon
cried
out
i
ca
hardly
breeve
an
it
drefful
dark
it
lucky
i
tried
it
replied
charlie
but
i
fix
it
all
nice
and
pushing
out
the
stone
with
his
foot
he
went
up
stairs
and
returned
with
an
old
bayonet
with
which
he
succeeded
in
dexterously
working
some
small
holes
through
the
mortar
with
which
the
crevices
of
the
stones
were
filled
this
was
so
ingeniously
done
that
it
would
not
be
noticed
and
yet
enough
light
and
air
were
let
in
to
make
the
place
tolerable
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
intended
it
was
now
past
noon
and
they
went
up
stairs
and
charlie
looked
out
again
to
see
if
there
were
any
signs
of
danger
but
still
all
was
quiet
along
the
potomac
i
do
think
sagely
observed
charlie
that
the
indians
are
ever
coming
back
in
my
opinion
they
have
had
about
enough
of
fighting
they
cleared
off
so
quick
and
there
is
so
many
of
them
dead
at
which
bub
waxed
valiant
and
said
i
wish
i
had
my
big
stick
to
stick
into
their
backs
if
they
do
come
charlie
could
not
forbear
a
laugh
at
this
notwithstanding
the
sanguinary
scenes
that
had
crowded
the
last
few
days
with
horrors
but
answered
i
know
what
you
can
do
bub
to
drive
them
away
if
they
should
come
and
drawing
a
ball
of
twine
from
his
pocket
he
tied
it
to
the
trigger
of
one
of
the
mounted
rifles
then
feeling
again
in
his
pocket
for
his
knife
to
cut
off
the
string
he
said
where
my
jackknife
i
must
have
lost
it
in
going
to
the
spring
for
water
lots
of
things
tumbled
out
as
i
crawled
through
the
grass
never
mind
i
can
use
a
and
taking
one
from
the
table
he
divided
the
string
so
as
to
leave
the
end
of
it
hanging
within
easy
reach
of
bub
he
did
the
same
to
all
the
guns
now
he
explained
to
bub
when
i
tell
you
to
pull
one
of
these
strings
you
must
do
it
as
quick
as
you
can
i
will
whisper
pull
and
you
must
take
right
hold
of
the
twine
and
draw
it
so
and
contrary
to
charlie
intention
bang
went
the
rifle
why
i
did
mean
to
do
that
but
it
will
show
you
how
pulling
the
string
made
the
gun
go
off
you
see
bub
was
all
attention
and
asked
eagerly
shall
i
do
it
now
o
no
replied
charlie
i
mean
when
i
you
to
when
the
indians
come
and
i
say
suppose
for
instance
i
should
get
up
in
this
way
and
he
ascended
to
the
lookout
and
i
should
look
out
in
this
way
and
he
put
his
eye
to
the
and
i
should
see
a
big
indian
coming
to
kill
bub
yes
answered
the
little
listener
i
knows
and
his
eyes
glistened
with
excitement
well
as
i
was
saying
i
peep
out
and
i
see
a
big
indian
coming
bub
at
this
instinctively
drew
nearer
the
string
his
gaze
on
charlie
and
i
should
whisper
instantly
bub
fat
fist
twitched
the
string
and
a
second
report
echoed
over
the
prairie
what
did
you
do
that
for
asked
his
brother
much
displeased
i
did
wish
you
to
do
it
now
i
was
only
explaining
how
to
do
it
and
i
want
you
to
do
it
right
do
touch
the
strings
till
i
tell
you
and
then
when
i
give
the
word
you
pull
wo
you
looked
as
if
he
intended
to
stand
by
the
guns
in
that
way
bub
continued
charlie
we
could
keep
off
a
great
many
indians
i
loading
and
firing
and
you
firing
too
bub
but
i
put
that
last
rifle
in
just
right
and
glancing
out
of
the
hole
as
he
adjusted
it
he
turned
deathly
pale
and
his
whispered
utterance
was
strangely
faint
as
he
exclaimed
if
there
is
an
indian
now
it
is
said
by
old
hunters
accustomed
to
shoot
small
game
however
skilful
in
the
use
of
they
may
be
that
the
first
time
they
see
a
large
animal
a
deer
for
example
such
a
nervous
excitement
seizes
them
although
the
creature
stands
within
a
few
feet
of
them
for
an
instant
they
can
not
command
themselves
to
fire
and
when
they
do
they
are
sure
to
miss
the
object
it
is
not
surprising
then
that
charlie
was
for
a
moment
paralyzed
he
gazed
at
the
indian
as
if
fascinated
as
the
savage
glided
along
his
head
bent
going
from
the
spring
towards
the
tree
in
the
very
path
through
which
charlie
had
carried
the
water
stooping
to
pick
up
something
then
keeping
on
a
few
paces
then
stopping
and
putting
his
ear
to
the
ground
as
if
intently
listening
he
was
within
easy
range
of
charlie
rifle
all
the
time
yet
the
boy
lifted
not
his
finger
the
savage
now
rapidly
darted
forward
as
if
following
trail
and
sweeping
the
bushes
back
with
his
hand
discovered
the
opening
in
the
tree
and
to
charlie
amazement
managed
to
creep
in
nearly
an
hour
had
passed
and
charlie
still
waited
in
painful
suspense
wondering
what
next
would
transpire
when
he
saw
a
score
or
more
of
indians
stealthily
approaching
from
different
directions
towards
the
cabin
the
blood
returned
to
charlie
face
and
recovering
his
senses
he
whispered
to
bub
the
indians
have
come
he
then
took
sight
across
the
rifle
nearest
bub
and
found
that
it
covered
several
of
the
savages
and
taking
aim
with
the
one
next
to
it
he
said
to
his
little
brother
pull
bub
did
so
and
starting
on
the
round
trot
pulled
each
string
in
succession
a
broadside
ensued
that
would
have
done
honor
to
an
ship
of
war
the
effect
was
prodigious
the
savages
seemed
to
think
that
a
strong
force
occupied
the
cabin
for
with
a
loud
yell
and
a
hasty
discharge
of
they
vanished
from
sight
charlie
was
astounded
at
bub
misunderstanding
of
the
order
and
the
effect
produced
gazing
amazed
into
vacancy
for
the
enemy
had
disappeared
he
sprang
to
the
floor
hugged
bub
till
he
almost
suffocated
him
and
laughing
uncontrollably
stammered
that
beats
robinson
crusoe
the
scene
was
indeed
ludicrous
the
savages
had
come
to
carry
off
their
dead
comrades
and
creeping
cautiously
along
had
got
so
near
the
house
without
being
observed
that
their
suspicion
that
the
cabin
was
vacated
became
confirmed
the
discharge
of
the
rifles
by
the
boys
was
therefore
a
perfect
surprise
the
fact
that
they
were
permitted
to
get
so
near
before
they
were
fired
upon
impressing
them
all
the
more
for
they
well
knew
that
if
few
were
in
the
dwelling
to
defend
it
every
effort
would
have
been
put
forth
to
keep
them
at
a
distance
moreover
the
firing
coming
from
all
sides
of
the
dwelling
at
once
had
also
the
appearance
as
if
it
was
quite
heavily
manned
it
was
a
brilliant
day
and
the
light
puff
of
smoke
from
each
rifle
rose
at
once
into
the
air
giving
charlie
a
fine
view
of
the
field
and
the
simultaneous
springing
up
of
so
many
astonished
savages
their
queer
grimaces
and
the
grotesque
manner
in
which
they
scrambled
out
of
range
struck
the
lad
as
irresistibly
comic
especially
as
he
considered
that
it
was
bub
blunder
that
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
rout
recovering
himself
he
proceeded
to
reload
the
rifles
but
one
thing
gave
him
uneasiness
the
indian
he
was
quite
sure
was
still
in
the
tree
what
was
he
there
for
perhaps
thought
charlie
he
will
make
a
hole
through
the
tree
and
watch
his
chance
and
shoot
me
at
any
rate
he
a
spy
and
if
he
should
find
out
that
only
bub
and
i
were
here
he
might
make
us
trouble
he
was
puzzled
to
know
what
to
do
he
set
himself
to
watch
through
the
to
see
if
he
would
come
out
two
long
hours
charlie
remained
at
his
post
till
he
grew
weary
with
the
duty
then
he
bethought
himself
of
another
plan
he
had
read
in
the
old
spelling
book
of
the
boy
who
would
descend
from
the
farmer
apple
tree
for
coaxing
and
the
farmer
said
if
you
will
not
come
down
for
words
i
try
the
effect
of
stones
which
brought
the
trespasser
quickly
to
the
ground
now
the
indian
was
not
a
tree
but
he
was
one
and
he
would
not
come
out
for
charlie
watching
so
charlie
thought
he
would
employ
harder
arguments
and
aiming
at
the
point
where
he
supposed
the
savage
must
be
in
his
he
blazed
away
he
had
fired
three
times
when
suddenly
the
tawny
occupant
slipped
out
and
crouched
behind
the
tree
from
which
he
commenced
making
friendly
signs
towards
the
corner
of
the
cabin
from
which
the
bullets
came
charlie
understood
the
signals
but
muttering
you
ca
catch
me
that
way
old
villain
continued
firing
every
time
he
thought
he
could
hit
the
savage
the
indian
had
not
during
all
this
fired
in
return
this
seemed
curious
to
the
boy
but
concluding
it
to
be
an
indian
trick
he
determined
not
to
be
outwitted
whatever
the
object
of
the
savage
was
in
his
mysterious
conduct
he
at
last
despaired
of
accomplishing
it
and
adroitly
slipped
away
as
night
drew
its
heavy
curtains
around
the
beleaguered
cabin
charlie
experienced
a
feeling
of
dread
creeping
over
him
he
felt
comparatively
safe
while
he
could
see
the
foe
but
now
the
night
seemed
ominous
of
evil
the
wind
moaning
through
the
trees
the
ticking
of
the
insect
under
the
bark
in
the
logs
and
even
the
shrill
chirping
of
the
cricket
sounded
unnatural
to
him
he
thought
of
the
dead
and
gory
forms
stretched
upon
the
greensward
without
the
grass
matted
with
human
blood
the
imprecations
and
fierce
shouts
that
had
resounded
and
the
deathly
struggles
that
passed
before
him
while
sheltered
by
the
friendly
tree
the
heavy
tramp
of
men
fighting
in
the
deadly
struggle
the
sharp
reports
of
the
the
horrible
screams
and
pleadings
of
women
and
children
as
they
were
murdered
and
tortured
by
the
savages
the
lurid
glare
of
the
burning
cabins
the
indians
dancing
and
yelling
in
horrid
mirth
his
active
brain
was
filled
with
such
remembrances
in
the
stillness
and
loneliness
of
night
in
that
cabin
these
awful
scenes
came
up
with
appalling
vividness
and
weird
and
demon
faces
seemed
to
peep
and
mutter
at
him
from
the
corners
of
the
room
once
he
fancied
that
he
heard
the
cellar
stairs
creak
under
a
heavy
tread
and
while
bub
slept
peacefully
in
childish
unconsciousness
of
his
brother
terror
he
shivered
and
watched
through
that
long
night
until
the
rosy
beams
of
morning
dispelled
the
illusions
of
the
darkness
chapter
xx
long
hair
the
news
of
jones
death
together
with
the
atrocities
connected
with
the
indian
uprising
spread
a
gloom
throughout
the
fort
and
when
two
days
later
the
funeral
of
the
pioneer
took
place
tears
were
in
many
a
veteran
eye
general
mcelroy
respected
the
qualities
which
had
marked
the
last
days
of
the
deceased
and
said
he
did
not
serve
in
the
ranks
but
if
ever
a
man
deserved
a
burial
poor
jones
does
and
he
shall
have
it
so
the
body
was
borne
to
the
grave
under
military
escort
the
soldiers
marching
to
the
mournful
strains
of
the
funeral
dirge
and
muffled
drums
the
corpse
was
lowered
to
its
last
the
burial
service
read
with
a
trembling
voice
by
the
chaplain
for
the
missionary
had
taken
his
place
among
the
mourners
by
the
side
of
the
widow
the
usual
salute
was
fired
and
the
procession
retraced
its
steps
jones
felt
that
she
was
now
bereaved
indeed
and
almost
alone
in
the
world
and
it
became
a
question
with
her
what
she
could
do
under
the
circumstances
for
herself
and
family
disconsolately
she
discussed
this
matter
with
tom
i
can
not
remain
longer
in
these
apartments
living
on
the
hospitality
of
the
general
said
she
and
as
your
dear
father
is
gone
it
becomes
me
to
earn
something
for
my
own
support
i
must
have
robert
with
me
he
is
so
young
and
make
some
humble
home
where
you
can
be
with
us
as
much
as
possible
but
what
i
can
do
to
effect
this
i
can
not
now
see
there
are
so
few
opportunities
for
women
to
earn
it
goaded
tom
that
his
mother
was
under
the
necessity
of
talking
in
so
depressed
a
way
and
that
he
could
do
nothing
suitably
to
provide
for
her
at
this
juncture
there
was
a
gentle
knock
at
the
door
and
mcelroy
entered
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
have
intruded
said
she
but
i
came
in
to
ask
what
arrangements
if
any
you
had
made
for
the
future
and
to
say
that
if
you
have
nothing
better
in
view
the
general
and
myself
would
like
to
have
you
remain
with
us
but
i
have
already
been
dependent
on
your
hospitality
too
long
objected
jones
and
it
seems
proper
that
i
should
make
a
home
for
myself
and
robert
as
soon
as
possible
have
you
any
suitable
place
provided
as
yet
asked
mcelroy
not
decisively
answered
the
widow
it
could
not
be
expected
that
you
would
so
soon
answered
mcelroy
now
we
have
a
plan
for
you
which
may
be
to
our
mutual
advantage
the
little
community
dwelling
within
these
brick
walls
is
a
very
social
one
and
the
general
time
and
my
own
is
so
much
occupied
that
my
children
suffer
for
a
mother
care
you
are
exactly
the
person
we
need
to
take
the
oversight
of
them
your
own
children
are
a
credit
to
you
they
show
that
you
have
just
the
qualities
of
mind
and
heart
for
such
a
position
now
if
you
will
look
a
little
after
my
children
training
you
will
take
a
burden
from
my
hands
and
a
load
of
anxiety
from
my
mind
and
between
us
both
i
think
we
can
manage
so
as
not
to
be
overcharged
but
robert
began
jones
hesitatingly
the
general
has
taken
a
great
fancy
to
him
and
says
if
he
can
have
him
he
will
make
something
of
him
and
what
my
husband
undertakes
he
never
does
by
halves
robert
would
have
the
best
of
advantages
and
be
under
your
own
eye
jones
emotions
were
too
great
for
words
this
unexpected
provision
for
herself
and
boy
seemed
truly
providential
she
might
go
the
world
over
and
not
meet
with
such
delicate
and
appreciative
treatment
still
she
hesitated
her
life
in
the
squatter
cabin
through
so
many
years
of
deprivation
and
poverty
placed
her
in
her
own
consciousness
in
such
painful
contrast
to
the
courtly
and
elegant
mcelroy
that
she
felt
diffident
about
accepting
so
responsible
a
trust
and
she
understood
children
well
enough
to
know
that
the
offspring
of
the
rich
often
look
down
on
those
in
humbler
circumstances
would
the
general
children
respect
her
as
they
should
in
order
for
her
to
assume
such
a
relation
towards
them
as
their
mother
wished
these
thoughts
passed
rapidly
through
her
mind
and
in
justice
to
them
as
well
as
herself
she
felt
that
she
would
like
to
have
that
point
put
to
rest
she
was
a
woman
of
straightforward
good
sense
and
therefore
decided
to
be
frank
in
the
matter
and
asked
but
would
the
arrangement
be
agreeable
to
your
children
madam
mcelroy
had
foreseen
this
and
was
prepared
with
an
answer
she
rang
the
bell
and
black
nancy
appeared
send
alice
and
willie
here
she
said
and
in
a
moment
the
brother
and
sister
came
running
in
children
said
their
mother
i
been
trying
to
persuade
jones
to
stay
with
us
and
take
charge
of
you
how
would
you
like
that
o
that
would
be
so
nice
said
alice
crossing
to
jones
and
putting
her
arms
around
her
neck
an
action
that
was
peculiar
to
her
it
would
be
real
good
in
her
i
sure
chimed
in
willie
and
then
i
could
have
robert
to
play
with
me
he
makes
splendid
popguns
could
i
mother
so
it
was
settled
and
in
such
a
manner
that
jones
was
made
to
feel
that
she
was
conferring
a
favor
rather
than
having
one
conferred
on
her
and
in
fact
the
arrangement
was
mutually
advantageous
as
mcelroy
had
sincerely
remarked
payson
now
called
to
take
leave
of
the
widow
and
ask
if
tom
would
like
to
return
with
him
he
was
much
pleased
with
the
arrangement
expressing
anew
his
sympathy
with
her
in
her
bereavements
and
charging
her
to
cling
to
the
consolation
of
the
gospel
he
and
tom
took
their
departure
the
latter
tenderly
kissing
his
mother
and
robert
as
he
bade
them
good
by
you
must
come
often
and
see
your
mother
said
mcelroy
cordially
you
know
we
shall
be
like
one
family
hereafter
and
not
only
robert
and
your
mother
will
be
lonesome
without
you
but
the
rest
of
the
children
will
be
glad
to
have
you
join
them
in
their
amusements
and
studies
to
which
assurance
alice
and
willie
looked
their
approval
as
the
wheels
of
the
missionary
buggy
rumbled
out
of
the
square
jones
said
with
a
sigh
what
a
change
has
come
over
my
flock
within
a
few
days
my
husband
and
sarah
and
dear
little
bub
murdered
by
the
indians
and
charlie
also
i
suppose
i
must
say
although
there
is
something
peculiarly
trying
in
the
mystery
that
hangs
over
his
fate
you
do
not
really
know
then
what
became
of
him
observed
mcelroy
no
and
this
uncertainty
is
agonizing
perhaps
he
was
captured
by
the
indians
and
may
be
at
this
very
moment
suffering
the
most
barbarous
treatment
from
them
or
the
dear
boy
may
have
been
devoured
by
a
wild
beast
or
he
may
be
starving
in
the
wilderness
this
suspense
concerning
him
is
too
much
to
bear
and
she
looked
anxiously
out
of
the
window
but
the
hour
for
dinner
had
arrived
and
jones
and
robert
went
down
with
the
others
to
dine
as
they
entered
the
the
general
directed
their
attention
to
the
corner
of
the
room
and
there
wrapped
in
his
blanket
sat
an
indian
whom
jones
after
the
first
start
of
surprise
recognized
as
long
hair
jones
said
the
general
perhaps
you
can
find
out
what
the
wants
he
is
very
communicative
with
me
but
seems
anxious
to
see
your
tom
i
am
glad
to
meet
you
said
jones
kindly
to
the
savage
have
you
anything
of
importance
to
communicate
but
long
hair
appeared
as
if
something
had
gone
wrong
with
him
and
sat
in
moody
silence
will
you
not
speak
to
me
long
hair
asked
jones
you
know
i
always
treated
you
well
have
i
not
white
squaw
good
to
injin
sojer
say
injin
lie
sojer
call
long
hair
dog
tell
him
go
way
some
of
your
men
have
long
hair
i
afraid
said
jones
to
the
general
well
said
the
general
i
see
that
they
do
do
it
any
more
and
wishing
to
propitiate
the
tawny
brave
he
added
perhaps
long
hair
would
take
some
dinner
with
us
but
the
indian
was
so
easily
appeased
and
said
long
hair
no
long
hair
shoot
deer
shoot
raccoon
catch
fish
plenty
but
interposed
jones
did
you
bring
some
venison
to
my
cabin
one
day
and
did
i
refuse
it
long
hair
white
squaw
good
he
repeated
long
hair
never
forget
long
hair
sick
white
squaw
medicine
him
long
hair
kill
deer
for
white
squaw
yes
said
jones
you
were
sick
and
i
took
care
of
you
as
i
ought
to
and
you
have
been
very
kind
to
me
and
mine
and
i
shall
never
forget
it
under
her
gentle
influence
the
indian
was
persuaded
to
partake
of
the
food
placed
before
him
he
ate
with
a
voracity
which
showed
that
he
had
been
long
fasting
and
his
appearance
indicated
that
he
had
seen
hardship
and
danger
jones
was
satisfied
that
his
coming
portended
something
to
her
either
good
or
evil
and
from
his
reserve
she
feared
it
might
be
the
latter
and
the
better
to
draw
out
of
him
the
tidings
whatever
they
might
be
related
the
circumstances
attending
her
husband
death
referring
to
the
murder
of
sarah
and
little
bub
and
the
disappearance
of
charlie
adding
that
she
supposed
he
was
also
killed
the
indian
listened
in
silence
till
she
spoke
of
charlie
and
little
bub
and
then
with
energy
exclaimed
charlie
no
dead
bub
no
dead
but
bub
must
be
dead
said
jones
for
i
saw
him
shot
by
yellow
bank
no
injin
speak
truth
what
makes
you
think
so
asked
she
astonished
long
hair
made
no
reply
but
drawing
from
beneath
his
blanket
a
little
shoe
he
placed
it
on
the
edge
of
the
table
then
by
its
side
he
laid
an
old
battered
jackknife
why
long
hair
cried
jones
deeply
agitated
that
shoe
and
charlie

did
you
get
them

come
to
fort
well
that
strange
said
general
mcelroy
from
long
account
there
seems
to
be
a
number
in
the
cabin
it
must
be
that
all
the
settlers
were
not
massacred
and
have
returned
and
taken
possession
of
the
cabin
we
must
send
a
force
to
their
relief
but
where
are
charlie
and
bub
asked
jones
of
the
indian
long
hair
do
know
think
in
cabin
how
many
persons
should
you
judge
from
the
firing
were
in
the
cabin
inquired
the
general
long
hair
do
know
no
trail
what
does
long
hair
mean
by
that
asked
mcelroy
of
her
husband
he
means
that
there
is
no
appearance
of
any
of
the
settlers
being
about
the
cabin
said
the
general
which
makes
the
matter
still
more
incomprehensible
for
if
any
of
the
settlers
had
come
back
long
hair
would
have
traced
them
is
that
it
long
hair
the
indian
nodded
assent
and
yet
he
says
that
there
were
many
guns
fired
continued
the
general
so
many
that
quite
a
force
of
the
assailing
indians
were
and
fled
how
was
the
firing
done
long
hair
as
if
by
persons
that
were
used
to
handling
the
rifle
one
two
tree
bery
good
hit
injin
some
shoot
at
long
hair
good
much
hard
get
way
to
the
most
much
poor
shoot
here
shoot
dere
shoot
everywhere
but
what
makes
you
think
the
children
are
in
the
cabin
asked
jones
for
her
thoughts
were
constantly
recurring
to
them
trail
go
towards
cabin
replied
the
sagacious
red
man
follow
trail
shoot
long
hair
if
he
follow
trail
i
think
that
long
hair
is
right
said
the
general
striking
the
table
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
your
boys
were
born
to
be
heroes
madam
if
i
mistake
not
that
charlie
and
bub
of
yours
were
the
defenders
of
that
cabin
against
the
savages
and
yet
he
added
doubtfully
that
is
simply
absurd
it
beyond
the
power
of
two
little
boys
to
perform
such
a
feat
for
you
recollect
ladies
that
long
hair
said
that
not
only
a
number
of
guns
were
fired
but
at
the
same
time
and
to
conclude
that
two
little
boys
should
fire
off
a
score
of
guns
more
or
less
simultaneously
is
to
assent
to
a
physical
impossibility
the
truth
is
the
deeper
i
go
into
this
matter
the
more
i
puzzled
what
is
your
opinion
of
it
long
hair
long
hair
no
sense
no
tell
mind
much
dark
and
the
indian
seemed
mortified
that
his
sagacity
was
for
once
at
fault
no
white
settlers
in
cabin
charlie
and
bub
in
cabin
much
gun
fire
hurt
two
tree
injin
scare
much
injin
do
know
he
means
that
he
is
certain
that
no
settlers
have
returned
to
the
cabin
explained
jones
but
that
charlie
and
bub
are
there
while
as
to
who
shot
off
so
many
he
is
as
much
in
the
dark
as
ourselves
well
said
the
general
rising
there
is
one
way
to
clear
up
this
mystery
i
send
a
trusty
detachment
there
at
once
to
open
the
secrets
of
the
cabin
long
hair
rose
at
this
and
said
white
chief
send
sojer
to
cabin
right
way
bimeby
quick
yes
replied
the
general
and
i
should
like
to
have
you
go
with
them
as
guide
no
answered
the
indian
sententiously
long
hair
go
long
hair
always
go
and
starting
at
a
quick
pace
he
was
speedily
out
of
sight
chapter
xxi
pull
the
string
bub
the
high
state
of
excitement
into
which
charlie
had
been
kept
by
the
startling
events
connected
with
the
massacre
and
his
ingenious
defence
of
the
cabin
brought
about
a
reaction
great
lassitude
alternated
with
feverish
symptoms
he
felt
obliged
to
watch
during
the
long
hours
of
night
and
caught
such
snatches
of
sleep
as
performances
allowed
by
day
one
day
after
bub
had
had
his
breakfast
charlie
said
i
feel
as
if
i
was
going
to
be
sick
bub
my
mouth
tastes
dreadfully
and
my
head
aches
so
i
can
scarcely
see
if
i
should
get
well
and
the
indians
should
come
you
must
remember
and
go
into
the
hole
in
the
cellar
and
pull
the
stone
up
in
its
place
after
you
just
as
i
showed
you
how
and
keep
still
same
as
we
did
in
the
tree
and
shall
i
have
to

said
charlie
now
i

water
and
walking
with
unsteady
step
to
the
well
he
returned
with
a
pail
of
water
and
filling
the
descended
feebly
to
the
cellar
and
placed
it
in
the
hole
which
he
had
dug
then
carrying
most
of
the
provisions
that
they
had
deposited
them
there
also
and
going
up
stairs
again
he
started
for
the
bed
but
suddenly
stopped
and
putting
his
hand
over
his
eyes
said
o
where
is
it
i
ca
see
i
so
dizzy
and
fell
by
the
side
of
it
on
the
hard
floor
bub
looked
on
in
wonder
scarcely
comprehending
the
meaning
of
it
saying
did
the
cellar
hurt
you
charlie
but
there
was
no
answer
in
a
few
moments
after
charlie
opened
his
eyes
and
said
bub
i
dreadful
sick
if
the
indians
should
come
and
you
must
watch
for
them
bub
else
they
might
come
when
you
was
looking
then
he
relapsed
into
silence
did
you
charlie
said
bub
wondering
that
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
the
dear
little
voice
seemed
to
recall
his
wandering
thoughts
and
taking
up
what
he
was
saying
where
he
had
left
off
continued
if
the
indians
should
come
bub
remember
and
pull
the
strings
perhaps
that
will
frighten
them
off
as
it
did
before
if
it
does
go
right
into
the
hole
in
the
cellar
as
i
told
you
i
fraid
to
go
into
the
cellar
you
but
you
must
answered
charlie
or
the
indians
will
kill
you
but
you
wo
feel
afraid
if
you
pray
god
to
take
care
of
you
is
dod
stronger
than
dark
asked
bub
yes
said
charlie
he
made
the
dark
he
made
you
and
everything
but
he
added
i
feel
better
i
guess
i
get
on
the
bed
easier
there
charlie
was
threatened
with
brain
fever
as
his
bloodshot
eyes
flushed
face
and
throbbing
temples
revealed
the
strain
had
been
too
great
for
him
and
he
soon
seemed
to
be
unconscious
of
what
was
passing
around
him
and
moaned
and
tossed
incessantly
chary
of
his
scanty
store
of
provisions
not
knowing
how
long
they
might
be
shut
up
in
the
cabin
he
had
eaten
sparingly
himself
but
fed
bub
generously
not
only
from
love
to
his
little
brother
but
because
it
would
keep
him
the
more
quiet
the
had
worn
on
him
terribly
bub
had
small
comprehension
of
charlie
condition
and
finding
after
a
while
that
charlie
did
not
talk
with
him
he
took
the
post
of
sentinel
and
did
himself
great
credit
this
seemed
a
long
period
to
the
little
fellow
and
after
going
the
rounds
of
the
and
seeing
nothing
to
alarm
him
he
set
about
amusing
himself
the
skin
bag
containing
the
ammunition
caught
his
eye
so
getting
the
he
managed
to
dislodge
it
from
the
peg
on
which
it
hung
and
down
it
plumped
upon
the
floor
bub
looked
towards
charlie
at
this
to
see
what
he
would
say
but
as
he
did
not
seem
to
notice
lugged
the
bag
to
the
hearth
and
commenced
strewing
the
powder
upon
the
fire
this
was
highly
satisfactory
and
one
little
puff
would
go
up
sending
out
the
white
ashes
to
be
succeeded
by
another
as
fast
as
the
fat
fist
of
the
little
could
work
then
he
began
to
strew
the
powder
out
from
the
hearth
upon
the
floor
and
he
clapped
his
hands
in
glee
as
he
saw
the
fire
run
along
the
trains
that
he
had
laid
very
careless
was
he
in
his
pyrotechnic
contrivances
and
might
have
found
himself
involved
in
a
grand
explosion
had
he
not
bethought
himself
that
if
powder
was
good
to
burn
it
was
also
good
to
eat
now
it
chanced
that
charlie
in
his
investigations
in
the
cupboard
had
come
across
a
neglected
jug
that
contained
molasses
and
as
molasses
was
much
prized
by
bub
he
had
kept
it
for
that
little
sole
use
dealing
it
out
to
him
a
little
at
a
time
at
each
meal
so
bringing
out
the
jug
and
a
saucer
bub
filled
the
latter
with
molasses
into
which
he
stirred
the
powder
and
commenced
eating
the
sweet
mixture
he
knew
he
had
been
into
mischief
that
would
displease
his
brother
so
denying
himself
the
first
taste
taking
the
saucer
and
spoon
in
his
hand
he
trudged
to
the
bedside
and
said
bub
made
charlie
some
tandy
bub
good
boy
but
as
charlie
gave
no
heed
to
the
bub
put
the
saucer
upon
the
table
and
seating
himself
in
his
usual
place
at
meal
time
commenced
eating
the
compound
was
not
so
pleasant
as
its
inventor
had
expected
and
after
the
first
few
spoonfuls
was
abandoned
in
disgust
it
now
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
time
to
resume
his
post
as
sentry
mounting
to
his
first
outlook
his
little
blue
eyes
dilated
for
he
saw
an
indian
creeping
along
charlie
said
he
jumping
down
in
terror
injun
come
to
kill
bub
but
as
charlie
did
not
reply
he
clambered
on
the
bed
crying
charlie
to
bub
injun
come
then
supposing
that
the
reason
he
made
no
answer
was
because
he
had
burnt
the
powder
he
said
with
quivering
lip
bub
sorry
he
been
naughty
bub
wo
be
naughty
no
more
bub
love
charlie
and
he
put
his
little
face
lovingly
against
charlie
but
he
started
back
as
charlie
hot
cheeks
touched
his
tender
flesh
remembering
how
hot
his
own
flesh
was
when
tortured
with
thirst
in
the
tree
and
how
grateful
the
draught
of
water
was
charlie
fetched
from
the
spring
at
the
risk
of
his
life
bub
exclaimed
charlie
dry
bub
give
charlie
some
drink
and
hastening
to
the
table
he
took
from
it
the
large
bowl
and
filled
it
from
the
bucket
that
charlie
had
left
on
the
floor
and
climbing
with
it
on
the
bed
again
essaying
to
put
it
to
his
lips
upset
the
whole
over
his
face
and
neck
the
sudden
application
of
the
cold
water
proved
a
balm
to
the
sick
boy
and
recognizing
bub
he
inquired
confusedly
where
where
am
i
what
the
matter
injun
come
cried
bub
with
renewed
earnestness
charlie
attempted
to
rise
but
fell
back
exhausted
saying
while
a
growing
faintness
crept
over
him
i
ca
get
up
bub
i
so
sick
pull
the
string
bub
did
as
he
was
directed
and
again
the
cabin
fort
broke
the
stillness
of
prairie
and
forest
with
its
unmanned
broadside
now
said
charlie
his
voice
sinking
to
a
whisper
go
and
hide
yourself
in
the
cellar
bub
and
keep
very
still
i
you
said
bub
i
am
so
sick
answered
charlie
i
ca
go
with
you
i
so
quivered
bub
as
he
saw
the
deathly
pallor
creeping
over
charlie
face
and
the
fixed
look
of
his
eyes
pray
and
then
go
and
keep
still
said
charlie
and
little
bub
knelt
by
the
bedside
and
folding
his
hands
repeated
now
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
i
pray
the
lord
my
soul
to
keep
if
i
should
die
before
i
wake
i
pray
the
lord
my
soul
to
take
and
then
adding
of
his
own
accord
please
dod
take
care
of
charlie
and
do
let
the
dark
hurt
bub
rising
he
said
bub
now
and
descending
into
the
cellar
he
crept
into
his
in
the
wall
and
carefully
readjusted
the
stone
the
indian
that
bub
had
seen
was
long
hair
while
he
was
cautiously
reconnoitring
the
command
under
captain
manly
had
reached
the
ground
the
soldiers
found
the
outer
door
securely
fastened
and
though
they
thundered
for
admittance
there
was
no
response
from
within
in
their
impatience
some
broke
down
the
door
while
others
scaled
the
walls
captain
manly
was
the
first
to
enter
and
the
soldiers
pushed
in
eagerly
after
him
anxious
to
rescue
the
settlers
if
any
were
there
still
instantly
his
eye
caught
the
figure
stretched
on
the
bed
hush
boys
said
he
reverently
the
little
fellow
is
dead
tears
filled
the
eyes
of
the
men
as
they
gathered
about
their
officer
and
gazed
silently
upon
the
features
of
the
boy
a
placid
look
was
upon
the
brave
lad
countenance
his
hair
lay
in
dank
masses
in
fine
contrast
to
his
white
forehead
while
the
lessons
of
which
he
had
been
taught
made
his
expression
mature
and
noble
captain
manly
stooped
and
kissed
the
cold
forehead
and
the
soldiers
instinctively
lifted
their
caps
meanwhile
the
cabin
had
been
carefully
searched
there
not
a
soul
in
it
said
sergeant
eaton
touching
his
cap
the
little
lad
yonder
seems
to
have
been
all
alone
impossible
what
did
that
firing
mean
from
the
cabin
just
as
we
rode
up
and
here
you
see
are
no
less
than
a
dozen
rifles
all
nicely
mounted
where
are
the
fingers
that
pulled
the
triggers
sergeant
there
is
some
mystery
here
that
needs
to
be
unravelled
have
you
searched
the
cellar
we
have
sir
was
the
reply
the
officers
stood
looking
at
each
other
perplexed
and
were
continuing
their
conversation
in
a
low
tone
when
long
hair
entered
and
without
noticing
any
one
stood
with
folded
arms
gazing
at
charlie
long
hair
said
the
captain
turning
abruptly
towards
him
how
long
did
you
get
here
before
we
did
little
time
not
much
were
you
on
the
ground
when
we
heard
the
discharge
in
tree
just
here
over
dere
did
any
one
leave
the
cabin
after
the
guns
were
fired
no
leave
cabin
he
answered
who
do
you
think
fired
the
guns
long
hair
charlie
fire
gun
but
charlie
is
dead
and
the
discharge
was
only
a
few
moments
ago
no
indian
no
sense
charlie
no
fire
gun
bub
fire
gun
impossible
returned
the
captain
impatiently
how
could
such
a
child
do
it
what
string
for
asked
long
hair
pointing
to
the
twine
that
hung
from
the
gun
triggers
which
being
so
near
the
color
of
the
walls
had
been
detected
only
by
the
indian
keen
glance
this
ingenious
arrangement
was
examined
with
interest
and
the
conviction
was
fast
gaining
ground
that
long
hair
was
not
far
from
right
in
his
conclusions
but
where
is
the
child
asked
the
captain
and
again
they
searched
the
cabin
the
closet
was
peered
into
to
its
topmost
shelf
a
few
boxes
that
had
been
left
emptied
of
their
contents
even
the
bed
on
which
charlie
lay
was
minutely
examined
and
the
improbable
supposition
that
the
walls
of
the
cellar
might
conceal
him
was
renounced
as
the
soldiers
struck
the
butts
of
their
guns
against
the
stones
is
it
possible
asked
the
captain
of
long
hair
for
he
had
learned
to
rely
much
on
his
sagacity
that
bub
could
escape
from
the
house
long
hair
shook
his
head
saying
no
trail
bub
no
go
may
it
plase
your
honor
said
the
irish
private
touching
his
cap
to
the
captain
i
belave
on
me
sowl
that
it
the
ghost
of
the
brave
lad
that
shot
the
guns
the
likes
of
him
sir
would
be
afther
defendin
the
cabin
if
was
only
out
of
respect
to
the
onburied
bodies
of
the
women
and
the
childers
that
has
been
murthured
by
the
hathen
savages
bad
luck
to
long
hair
said
the
captain
smiling
at
the
superstition
of
the
hibernian
i
a
mind
while
the
men
are
taking
their
rations
on
the
grass
to
leave
you
to
clear
up
this
mystery
i
believe
if
any
one
can
find
it
out
you
can
the
men
having
fallen
into
line
stacked
their
guns
and
long
hair
was
left
alone
with
charlie
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
quiet
form
of
the
boy
and
the
workings
of
his
usually
stolid
face
showed
the
affection
which
he
felt
for
him
he
then
carefully
looked
about
the
room
then
went
quietly
out
and
passed
around
the
cabin
critically
examining
the
ground
as
he
walked
he
soon
returned
and
made
directly
for
the
cellar
gliding
noiselessly
in
his
moccasins
down
the
stairs
in
the
dim
light
he
carefully
went
over
the
cellar
bottom
taking
up
some
of
the
litter
with
which
it
was
covered
he
gently
scraped
the
fresh
sand
away
until
he
came
to
litter
again
patiently
and
carefully
then
he
removed
the
top
litter
from
a
wide
space
noticing
from
which
direction
the
sand
had
been
thrown
and
in
a
moment
he
was
standing
where
the
heap
had
been
which
charlie
and
bub
had
shovelled
away
stooping
down
now
he
saw
where
the
earth
had
been
fretted
by
the
stone
as
it
had
been
pulled
out
and
in
then
he
placed
his
ear
to
the
ground
and
listened
intently
instantly
he
glided
from
the
cellar
and
stood
with
folded
arms
before
captain
manly
well
what
luck
asked
the
captain
long
hair
find
pappoose
there
was
a
general
excitement
at
this
and
a
number
arose
as
if
eager
to
follow
the
captain
and
the
indian
but
long
hair
stirred
not
saying
angrily
too
much
sojer
scare
pappoose
that
is
sensible
said
the
captain
you
and
i
will
go
alone
long
hair
the
indian
led
him
at
once
to
the
place
in
the
wall
where
bub
was
concealed
pappoose
in
dere
said
the
indian
pointing
to
the
stone
take
stone
out
the
captain
drew
it
forth
got
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
peeped
in
and
saw
bub
bright
eyes
looking
into
his
and
taking
hold
of
bub
chubby
hand
he
said
soothingly
for
bub
now
began
to
cry
do
be
afraid
my
little
fellow
we
are
all
your
friends
and
have
come
to
take
you
to
your
mother
wo
injun
kill
me
asked
bub
glancing
apprehensively
at
long
hair
no
said
the
officer
it
long
hair
he
came
to
keep
the
bad
indians
from
killing
you
when
captain
manly
appeared
with
bub
in
his
arms
the
air
was
rent
with
the
joyful
shouts
of
the
soldiers
and
bub
suddenly
found
himself
a
hero
as
he
was
borne
about
and
caressed
by
them
a
joy
that
was
suddenly
intensified
to
a
wild
pitch
of
excitement
as
word
was
brought
that
dear
brave
romantic
charlie
had
revived
he
was
not
dead
aroused
by
the
shouts
of
the
soldiers
over
bub
appearance
he
had
opened
his
eyes
and
imagining
that
the
indians
were
assailing
the
cabin
murmured
in
a
clear
distinct
voice
pull
the
string
bub
chapter

and
the

farmer

postmaster
and
drew
his
chair
to
the
fire
the
large
stove
had
an
open
front
and
it
was
pleasant
on
such
a
piercing
day
to
see
the
flames
leap
and
hear
the
wood
crackle
and
sit
in
the
genial
warmth
the
table
was
neatly
set
for
supper
there
was
a
platter
of
cold
prairie
chicken
a
glass
dish
containing
sauce
and
a
plate
of
biscuit
while
on
the
stove

stood
a
white
tureen
holding
a
few
slices
of
hot
toast
cowles
having
been
informed
by
her
liege
lord
that
her
presence
was
not
desired
at
that

hour
had
gladly
improved
the
opportunity
to
take
a
cup
of
tea
with
her
friend
barker
and
learn
the
particulars
concerning
the
accident
that
happened
to
bill
walker
and
maria
hobbs
the
night
before
who
while
returning
from
a
dance
six
miles
away
were
upset
from
the
wagon
into
slough
creek
cowles
dearly
loved
a
dish
of
gossip
which
smoking
hot
and
seasoned
to
one
taste
was
always
to
be
had
at
barker
the
cowles
were
a
and
race
from
the
least
of
them
to
the
greatest
and
charles
cowles
was
not
a
whit
behind
the
shrewdest
of
them
in
this
respect
it
was
a
stormy
afternoon
in
march
and
the
winds
which
like
troops
of
wild
horses
came
careering
across
the
prairies
and
charged
upon
the
framed
house
furiously
whirled
the
snow
and
made
shrill
wintry
music
cowles
added
more
fuel
to
the
fire
reseated
himself
put
his
feet
into
a
chair
and
fell
into
a
deep
study
he
was
the
moneyed
man
of
the
place
and
although
comparatively
a
new
comer
was
the
autocrat
of
the
settlement
his
first
visit
to
the
town
prospecting
caused
considerable
commotion
for
if
the
groves
and
prairies
had
been
arranged
on
the
plan
of
a
vast
the
fact
that
he
had
a
golden
purse
could
scarcely
have
circulated
more
rapidly
many
prophesied
he
would
not
condescend
to
dwell
in
so
small
a
town
a
surmise
that
seemed
the
more
probable
from
his
haughty
overbearing
carriage
and
when
it
was
certain
that
he
had
bought
out
the
best
of
the
two
stores
and
carpenters
were
set
to
work
building
a
large
addition
to
the
grocery
and
teams
arrived
from
the
mississippi
loaded
with
barrels
and
boxes
of
goods
there
was
general
congratulation
the
town
will
go
ahead
now
the
settlers
said
men
of
capital
are
beginning
to
come
in
and
land
is
sure
to
rise
but
cowles
did
not
pitch
his
tent
there
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
as
the
public
soon
had
reason
to
know
he
invested
nothing
in
improvements
but
simply
kept
his
stock
replenished
selling
at
the
high
frontier
prices
giving
credit
when
wanted
but
always
taking
ample
security
and
letting
money
in
the
same
way
at
five
per
cent
per
month
the
settlers
had
met
with
the
usual
financial
disappointments
of
the
frontier
and
then
a
business
revulsion
at
the
east
caused
a
fall
in
the
value
of
land
and
a
diminution
of
immigration
and
having
expended
the
little
they
had
on
their
arrival
they
were
compelled
to
do
as
best
they
could
in
this
extremity
it
became
common
for
them
to
get
trusted
at
the
store
for
groceries
and
hire
money
of
its
proprietor
and
in
an
astonishingly
short
space
of
time
the
sharp
grocer
held
mortgages
on
most
of
the
farms
in
the
neighborhood
he
was
inexorable
when
came
and
if
the
money
was
not
ready
he
foreclosed
deaf
to
all
appeals
but
of
this
he
invariably
gave
each
one
who
applied
for
a
loan
an
offensively
plain
warning
he
was
a
man
muscular
passionate
blasphemously
profane
had
a
remarkable
command
of
language
and
when
angered
his
eyes
seemed
to
shoot
lightning
and
he
would
gesticulate
with
great
energy
there
was
no
respect
of
persons
or
station
with
him
high
and
low
were
served
alike
when
credit
or
money
was
asked
for
he
would
say
certainly
sir
but
mind
you
with
a
fearful
oath
if
you
pay
according
to
agreement
i
sha
wait
a
moment
everybody
that
deals
with
me
has
to
be
on
the
square
o
yes
you
to
pay
but
you
wo
and
do
you
come
whining
and
crying
round
me
then
it
wo
make
any
sort
of
difference
i
put
my
grip
on
your
land
and
i
tell
you
now
that
i
sha
let
go
do
you
say
then
that
i
did
tell
you
beforehand
just
how
it
would
turn
out
the
of
the
young
village
was
feared
hated
and
fawned
upon
his
bearing
was
imperious
and
sneering
towards
all
he
had
a
vigorous
intellect
however
was
uncommonly
and
would
discourse
to
the
groups
in
his
store
sitting
with
his
stout
legs
hanging
over
the
counter
with
a
coarse
brilliancy
original
and
sagacious
from
which
the
more
cultured
might
cull
gems
of
thought
fresh
and
striking
despite
the
terrible
swearing
which
would
startle
even
bad
men
was
there
a
well
in
the
rock
of
this
man
hard
heart
we
shall
see
the
lines
of
the
face
were
bitterly
hard
but
on
this
afternoon
his
features
worked
as
if
strong
conflicting
emotions
were
striving
for
mastery
something
unusual
was
stirring
his
brain
he
sat
thinking
thinking
uneasily
shifting
his
position
and
at
length
arose
and
passing
through
a
dark
hall
entered
the
shop
and
said
ah
tom
is
that
you
yes
answered
the
young
man
diffidently
payson
said
you
wished
to
see
me
yes
walk
in
this
way
and
cowles
returned
to
the
followed
by
tom
do
you
know
why
i
sent
for
you
asked
the
grocer
no
sir
well
i
had
a
little
private
matter
that
i
wished
to
talk
with
you
about
but
i
hungry
as
a
bear
and
if
you
do
me
the
favor
to
drink
a
cup
of
tea
with
me
i
try
to
explain
tom
had
ever
shrunk
from
contact
with
this
man
and
marvelled
much
at
finding
himself
his
guest
yet
a
cosy
sitting
down
together
they
had
tom
host
being
singularly
attentive
to
him
while
they
partook
of
the
nice
edibles
tom
said
the
grocer
as
they
sat
back
from
the
table
i
heard
good
accounts
of
you
and
his
voice
grew
soft
and
tremulous
and
i
really
glad
of
it
and
i
had
an
eye
on
you
myself
quite
a
while
and
bad
as
they
say
old
cowles
is
i
like
to
see
others
do
well
you
stuck
by
your
folks
when
you
wished
to
go
off
that
right
you
made
the
most
of
your
schooling
that
in
your
favor
you
are
an
honest
lad
aiming
to
be
i
suspect
some
such
a
man
as
that
missionary
tom
surprise
grew
apace
how
did
this
rough
swearing
covetous
dealer
ferret
out
his
heart
secrets
you
wished
to
go
from
home
to
study
but
like
a
true
son
staid
by
to
help
the
family
that
must
have
been
a
great
to
you
was
it
not
yes
faltered
tom
of
course
it
was
but
how
did
you
manage
to
give
it
up
so
bravely
mother
advised
me
to
pray
about
it
and
i
did
do
you
think
it
does
any
good
to
pray
asked
the
grocer
o
yes
indeed
i
could
live
without
prayer
it
helps
me
so
much
but
objected
his
questioner
do
you
imagine
that
the
great
god
cares
enough
about
our
little
affairs
to
answer
the
trifling
requests
we
may
make
of
him
i
do
sir
replied
tom
with
glowing
cheeks
and
tearful
eyes
i
have
known
him
to
do
so
many
and
many
a
time
perhaps
you
were
deceived
o
cried
tom
if
you
had
been
in
the
missionary
family
as
much
as
i
have
and
heard
him
pray
for
things
and
then
see
just
what
he
asked
for
come
into
the
house
almost
before
he
arose
from
his
knees
you
could
not
doubt
that
god
had
heard
him
why
sir
how
do
you
suppose
he
has
managed
to
get
along
on
the
little
that
the
settlers
have
paid
him
unless
it
has
been
in
answer
to
prayer
i
am
sure
he
must
have
been
pinched
answered
the
moving
uneasily
i
would
like
to
relate
an
instance
or
two
continued
tom
if
it
would
not
be
no
no
it
wo
be
disagreeable
to
me
but
i
have
not
time
to
hear
it
now
i
believe
all
you
say
i
tell
you
what
it
is
young
man
he
added
rising
and
pacing
the
floor
deeply
agitated
i
know
more
about
these
matters
than
folks
think
there
my
brother
he
a
methodist
minister
just
like
this
missionary
about
praying
often
prayed
for
me
and
says
he
has
the
evidence
that
i
shall
be
converted
and
become
a
preacher
perhaps
you
will
earnestly
remarked
tom
you
have
ability
enough
to
do
a
great
deal
of
good
so
he
says
what
if
it
should
come
about
how
strange
it
would
seem
for
a
cursing
old
sinner
like
me
to
preach
and
pray
as
that
missionary
does
they
call
me
a
man
but
what
can
i
do
do
i
inform
every
soul
that
asks
me
for
money
that
he
a
fool
and
that
i
shall
hold
him
to
the
writing
i
get
their
lands
it
is
true
but
if
i
did
not
somebody
else
would
why
they
mortgage
all
they
have
and
then
buy
the
highest
priced
goods
in
the
store
i
no
patience
with
such
folks
and
they
do
get
much
mercy
from
me
but
bluntly
said
tom
i
ca
see
how
another
justifies
ours
that
so
he
returned
gloomily
but
i
a
different
sort
of
business
to
transact
with
you
than
to
defend
my
misdeeds
that
missionary
has
been
making
me
a
pastoral
visit
and
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
inform
me
that
the
lord
has
called
you
to
preach
the
gospel
and
that
it
is
my
duty
to
furnish
money
to
send
you
off
to
college
or
some
such
place
where
they
grind
out
ministers
me
exclaimed
tom
rising
to
his
feet
yes
you
sit
down
sit
down
young
man
and
be
calm
and
the
grocer
in
his
own
excitement
gesticulated
violently
with
both
arms
at
once
he
says
that
i
the
only
man
here
that
has
the
money
to
do
this
pretty
cool
is
it
to
dictate
to
old
cowles
the
miserly
in
that
way
i
just
turned
on
my
heel
and
left
him
in
the
middle
of
his
ordering
but
you
see
i
could
help
thinking
about
it
night
and
day
i
would
wonder
if
that
meddling
missionary
had
been
praying
about
it
all
the
while
and
the
result
is
the
old
is
going
to
give
you
a
lift
my
boy
we
hackneyed
hopeless
old
reprobates
need
just
such
preachers
as
the
famous
seminary
is
going
to
make
out
of
you
and
i
invited
you
here
to
say
that
you
can
depend
on
me
for
two
hundred
dollars
in
gold
to
start
with
and
as
much
more
each
year
till
you
graduate
as
the
missionary
says
you
need
when
old
cowles
begins
to
do
a
thing
mind
you
he
never
does
it
by
halves
but
said
tom
choking
with
joy
and
wonder
how
shall
i
pay
you
pay
pay
roared
the
grocer
his
eyes
shooting
flame
then
suddenly
waxing
tender
the
tears
extinguishing
the
if
you
will
pray
for
a
poor
old
rebel
like
me
it
is
all
the
pay
i
want
then
going
into
the
entry
he
called
johnson
johnson
here
sir
said
a
voice
and
the
dapper
little
tailor
who
rented
a
window
in
the
store
made
his
appearance
measure
this
young
man
for
a
suit
of
clothes
said
the
grocer
and
mind
and
give
him
a
genteel
fit
that
will
do
for
him

the
best
circles

enchanting

it
was
the
clear
honest
voice
of
deacon
palmer
that
fell
on
ear
and
which
he
now
heard
for
the
hundredth
time
year
in
and
out
at
morning
and
night
the
good
man
had
sung
this
his
favorite
song

he
was
with

as
if

tom
knocked
modestly
at
the
storekeeper
door
a
moment
and
the
opened
it
saying
heartily
walk
in
walk
in
no
i
thank
you
answered
tom
i
called
to
say
that
as
i
am
to
start
on
monday
to
begin
study
at
the
east
and
the
young
tones
grew
tremulous
general
and
mcelroy
and
mother
are
to
be
at
the
missionary
and
they
desire
the
pleasure
of
your
company
at
dinner
well
well
young
man
you
brought
a
message
have
you
exclaimed
the
grocer
fidgeting
about
a
pretty
company
that
would
be
would
it
old
cowles
sitting
down
to
table
with
a
minister
of
the
gospel
and
a
student
for
that
sacred
calling
and
such
like
folks
no
no
that
would
be
consistent
tell
them
that
i
am
much
obliged
but
now
cowles
exclaimed
tom
seizing
his
hand
you
must
come
i
shall
feel
dreadfully
hurt
if
you
refuse
and
they
all
want
you
to
so
much
and
you
know
that
if
it
was
not
for
your
kindness
there
there
boy
interrupted
the
storekeeper
his
black
eyes
flashing
through
tears
do
talk
in
that
way
all
is
if
it
will
please
you
i
come
but
how
do
you
go
to
the
river
monday
o
the
missionary
is
to
get
a
team
well
just
say
to
him
that
my
horses
are
at
his
service
we
will
not
dwell
upon
the
dinner
in
the
parsonage
during
which
irrepressible
bub
his
clerical
tastes
sharpened
by
example
took
clandestine
possession
of
the
attic
study
and
constituting
himself
preacher
audience
and
choir
undertook
to
conduct
divine
service
having
given
out
the
first
hymn
he
drowned
the
missionary
words
as
the
latter
said
grace
by
stoutly
singing
i
want
to
be
an
angel
an
angel
with
a
stand
neither
may
we
linger
amid
the
tender
solemn
scenes
of
the
sabbath
following
the
last
tom
was
to
spend
in
the
rude
frontier
sanctuary
it
was
evening
of
a
beautiful
day
in
may
when
the
capacious
carriage
drawn
by
his
trusty
grays
deposited
its
passengers
at
the
landing
to
await
the
steamer
what
a
lifetime
of
thought
and
emotion
seemed
crowded
into
that
interval
of
waiting
as
jones
stood
with
tom
clasped
closely
whispering
words
of
mingled
foreboding
hope
and
caution
to
be
a
minister
of
jesus
christ
how
glorious
how
sublime
said
she
there
is
nothing
i
so
much
desire
for
you
but
you
are
going
into
scenes
very
different
from
those
in
which
you
have
been
reared
scenes
which
will
have
their
peculiar
and
insidious
perils
i
foresee
that
you
will
rise
to
distinction
in
your
studies
but
do
not
seek
high
things
for
yourself
be
not
anxious
to
become
what
is
called
a
great
preacher
nor
aspire
to
a
settlement
sacrifice
not
conscience
for
place
and
power
and
the
applause
of
sect
keep
humble
keep
christ
ever
before
you
and
may
he
watch
between
me
and
thee
while
we
are
separated
from
each
other
and
she
kissed
him
a
fond
farewell
tom
stepped
aboard
the
steamer
which
rapidly
bore
him
away
carrying
in
his
heart
the
images
of
the
godly
missionary
alice
and
his
mother
the
little
group
that
stood
on
the
shore
gazing
so
lovingly
after
him
the
young
man
wept
freely
as
they
faded
from
sight
but
happily
the
magical
splendor
of
night
on
the
mississippi
broke
in
on
the
tumult
of
his
feelings
hundreds
of
lights
gleamed
from
the
shore
in
every
direction
from
village
and
city
and
town
from
cottage
and
homestead
while
steamer
after
steamer
illuminated
within
and
without
came
sweeping
sounding
thundering
on
like
some
monster
leviathan
spouting
fire
it
was
as
a
dream
of
enchantment
to
him
and
soon
stirred
his
brain
wonderfully
with
singular
vividness
the
eventful
past
of
his
pioneer
life
flitted
before
his
mental
vision
and
again
he
experienced
the
terrible
anxieties
and
thrills
of
horror
and
of
heroic
resolve
connected
with
the
indian
uprising
and
now
his
tears
flow
as
he
revisits
in
imagination
the
lonely
grave
of
his
father
on
the
prairie
would
the
dear
ones
that
survived
the
fearful
outbreak
be
long
safe
might
they
not
soon
need
his
aid
once
more
and
the
glowing
future
for
which
he
had
so
panted
would
it
be
to
him
all
he
had
fancied
would
he
pass
safely
the
dangers
his
mother
had
sketched
would
he
realize
her
ideal
and
the
kind
missionary
and
the
eccentric
they
had
high
expectations
