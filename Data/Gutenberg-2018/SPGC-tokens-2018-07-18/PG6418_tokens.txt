when

devoted
to
this
outer

said
joel
on
larry
said
miss
taylor
gently
bending
over
him
yes
sir
called
joel
back
from
the
alcove
the
unlucky
oar
was
seized
by
the
triumphant
crew
i
used
to
play
with
it
she
said
softly
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
little
shop
i
a
tea
i
wish
said
phronsie
slowly
that
you
come
in
little
girl
ca
the
girl
at
the
gate
peered
through
the
iron
railings
pressing
her
nose
quite
flat
to
give
the
sharp
restless
black
eyes
the
best
chance
please
do
begged
phronsie
coming
up
quite
close
i
very
much
wish
you
would
ca
repeated
the
girl
on
the
outside
cop
wo
let
me
who
asked
phronsie
much
puzzled
and
beginning
to
look
frightened
perlice
the
girl
nodded
briefly
taking
her
face
away
from
the
iron
railings
enough
to
accomplish
that
ceremony
then
she
plastered
her
nose
up
against
its
support
again
and
stared
at
phronsie
with
all
her
might
oh
said
phronsie
with
a
little
laugh
that
chased
away
her
fright
there
is
any
big
policeman
here
this
is
grandpapa
garden
it
the
perliceman
everything
the
perliceman
contradicted
the
girl
snapping
one
set
of
grimy
fingers
defiantly
oh
no
said
phronsie
softly
but
very
decidedly
this
is
my
dear
grandpapa
home
and
the
big
policeman
ca
get
in
here
ever
oh
you
ninny
the
girl
staring
at
her
through
the
railings
stopped
a
minute
to
laugh
covering
both
hands
over
her
mouth
to
smother
the
sound
the
perlice
can
go
everywheres
they
want
to
i
guess
some
of
in
heaven
now
spyin
round
phronsie
dropped
the
doll
she
was
carrying
close
to
her
bosom
to
concentrate
all
her
gaze
up
toward
the
sky
in
amazement
that
allowed
her
no
opportunity
to
carry
on
the
conversation
an
i
could
no
more
get
into
this
garden
than
i
could
into
heaven
the
girl
on
the
outside
said
at
last
to
bring
back
the
blue
eyes
to
earth
so
do
you
think
it
you
but
oh
my
do
i
wish
i
could
though
there
was
so
much
longing
in
the
voice
that
phronsie
brought
her
gaze
down
from
the
policemen
in
their
heavenly
work
to
the
eyes
staring
at
her
and
she
clasped
her
hands
together
tightly
and
hurried
up
to
lay
her
face
against
the
big
iron
gate
and
close
to
that
of
the
girl
he
wo
hurt
you
the
big
policeman
wo
she
whispered
softly
take
hold
of
your
hand
and
tell
him
how
it
is
if
he
gets
in
come
ca
the
girl
was
going
to
say
but
her
gaze
rested
upon
the
doll
lying
on
the
grass
where
it
fell
from
phronsie
hand
lawks
may
i
just
have
one
good
squint
at
that
she
burst
out
you
may
hold
it
said
phronsie
bobbing
her
head
till
her
yellow
hair
fell
over
her
flushed
cheeks
the
gate
flew
open
suddenly
nearly
overthrowing
her
and
the
girl
mostly
all
legs
and
arms
dashed
through
picking
up
the
doll
to
squeeze
it
to
her
neck
so
tightly
that
phronsie
rushed
up
quite
alarmed
oh
do
she
cried
you
frighten
her
i
tell
her
how
it
is
and
then
she
like
you
i
make
her
like
me
said
the
girl
with
savage
thrusts
at
the
doll
and
kissing
it
all
over
oh
my
ai
you
sweet
and
she
cuddled
it
fiercely
in
her
scrawny
neck
her
tangled
black
hair
falling
around
its
face
oh
dear
wailed
phronsie
standing
quite
still
she
my
child
and
she
dreadfully
frightened
oh
please
little
girl
do
do
so
she
been
your
child
forever
and
i
never
had
a
child
the
girl
raised
her
black
head
to
look
sternly
at
phronsie
i
give
her
back
but
she
mine
now
have
you
ever
had
a
child
asked
phronsie
suddenly
two
or
three
tears
trailing
off
her
round
cheeks
to
drop
in
the
grass
and
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
winked
very
fast
to
keep
the
others
back
not
a
smitch
of
one
declared
the
other
girl
decidedly
an
i
to
hold
this
one
and
pretend
i
its
mother
phronsie
drew
a
long
breath
and
drew
slowly
near
you
may
she
said
at
last
the
new
mother
did
hear
being
hungrily
engaged
in
smoothing
her
cheeks
against
her
own
dirty
ones
first
one
side
of
the
face
and
then
the
other
and
twitching
down
the
dainty
pink
gown
gone
awry
during
the
hugging
process
and
alternately
scolding
and
patting
the
little
figure
this
done
she
administered
a
smart
slap
plunged
over
to
the
nearest
tree
and
set
the
doll
with
a
thud
on
the
grass
to
rest
against
its
trunk
sit
up
like
a
lady
she
commanded
oh
do
cried
phronsie
quite
and
running
over
on
distressed
feet
she
my
child
she
gasped
no
she
mine
an
i
teachin
her
manners
i
ai
through
yet
said
the
girl
she
put
out
a
long
arm
and
held
phronsie
back
but
you
struck
her
phronsie
lifted
a
pale
face
and
her
blue
eyes
flashed
very
much
as
polly
brown
ones
did
on
occasion
the
new
mother
whirled
around
and
stared
at
her
why
i
had
to
just
the
same
as
you
licked
when
you
bad
she
said
in
astonishment
what
asked
phronsie
overcome
with
curiosity
yet
keeping
her
eyes
on
her
child
bolt
upright
against
the
tree
why
whipped
said
the
girl
just
the
same
as
you
are
when
you
bad
phronsie
drew
a
long
breath
i
never
been
whipped
she
said
slowly
oh
my
lord
the
girl
tumbled
down
to
the
grass
and
rolled
over
and
over
coming
up
suddenly
to
sit
straight
wipe
her
tangled
black
hair
out
of
her
eyes
and
stare
at
phronsie
well
you
are
a
freak
you
are
was
all
she
could
say
what
a
asked
phronsie
actually
turning
her
back
on
her
child
to
give
all
her
attention
to
this
absorbing
conversation
with
its
most
attractive
vocabulary
it
oh
jumbo
and
over
she
flopped
again
to
roll
and
laugh
well
there
and
she
jumped
to
her
feet
so
quickly
she
nearly
overthrew
phronsie
who
had
drawn
closer
unable
to
miss
a
bit
of
this
very
strange
proceeding
now
i
through
pretending
an
i
have
got
any
child
you
may
have
her
back
she
wrung
her
grimy
hands
together
and
turned
her
back
on
the
object
of
so
much
attention
take
her
quick
she
yours
phronsie
hurried
over
to
the
doll
sitting
up
in
pink
loveliness
against
the
tree
knelt
down
on
the
grass
and
patted
her
with
gentle
hand
and
smoothed
down
her
curls
a
curious
sound
broke
in
upon
her
work
and
she
looked
up
and
listened
i
must
go
back
she
whispered
to
her
child
and
in
a
minute
she
was
running
around
the
figure
of
the
girl
to
stare
into
her
face
ow
get
out
cried
the
girl
crossly
and
she
whirled
off
pulling
up
her
ragged
dress
to
her
face
i
thought
i
heard
you
cry
said
phronsie
in
a
troubled
voice
and
following
her
in
distress
phoo
cried
the
girl
snapping
her
fingers
in
derision
and
spinning
around
on
the
tips
of
her
toes
was
the
cat
no
said
phronsie
decidedly
and
shaking
her
head
it
could
be
the
cat
because
she
does
hardly
ever
cry
and
besides
she
is
here
and
she
looked
all
around
do
you
see
she
is
well
then
was
that
bird
said
the
girl
pointing
up
to
a
high
branch
ai
you
green
not
to
think
of
him
i
do
it
was
the
bird
said
phronsie
slowly
and
peering
up
anxiously
and
he
does
cry
again
so
i
know
he
could
have
cried
then
well
he
will
if
you
wait
long
enough
said
the
girl
defiantly
chee
chee
chee
sang
the
bird
with
delicious
little
trills
and
shaking
them
out
so
fast
his
small
throat
seemed
about
to
burst
with
its
efforts
there
you
see
he
could
cry
began
phronsie
in
a
burst
of
delight
you
see
little
girl
and
she
hopped
up
and
down
in
glee
he
got
the
an
he
cry
next
like
enough
said
the
girl
what
asked
phronsie
coming
out
of
her
glee
and
drawing
nearer
oh
i
see
some
tears
and
she
looked
soberly
up
into
the
thin
dirty
face
and
forgot
all
about
her
question
no
you
do
either
the
girl
twitched
away
angrily
there
ai
never
no
tears
you
could
see
on
me
was
the
cat
or
the
bird
ai
you
green
though
you
green
as
that
grass
there
and
she
spun
round
and
round
snapping
her
fingers
all
the
while
phronsie
stood
quite
still
and
regarded
her
sorrowfully
do
you
believe
i
cried
screamed
the
girl
dashing
up
to
her
to
snap
her
fingers
in
phronsie
face
say
you
do
this
minute
but
i
think
you
did
said
phronsie
oh
i
very
sure
you
did
and
you
may
hold
my
child
again
if
you
only
wo
cry
any
more
and
she
clasped
her
hands
tightly
together
the
other
girl
started
and
ran
toward
the
big
iron
gate
oh
do
phronsie
called
after
her
and
ran
to
overtake
the
flying
feet
please
stay
with
me
i
like
you
do
go
the
girl
threw
her
head
back
as
if
something
hurt
her
throat
then
leaned
her
face
against
the
iron
railings
and
stuck
her
fingers
in
her
ears
do
lem
me
alone
go
ca
you
she
wriggled
off
from
fingers
i
lick
you
if
you
do
lem
me
be
i
wish
you
play
with
me
said
phronsie
having
hard
work
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
flapping
shoes
all
down
at
the
heel
and
you
may
have
clorinda
for
your
very
own
child
as
long
as
you
stay
you
may
really
ow
see
here
up
came
the
girl
face
and
with
a
defiant
sweep
of
her
grimy
hands
she
brushed
both
cheeks
do
you
mean
that
honest
true
black
and
blue
yes
said
phronsie
very
much
relieved
to
see
the
effect
of
her
invitation
i
do
mean
it
little
girl
come
and
i
tell
clorinda
all
how
it
is
i
goin
outside
to
walk
up
and
down
a
bit
bring
on
your
doll
but
you
must
come
here
said
phronsie
moving
off
slowly
backward
over
the
grass
come
little
girl
holding
out
her
hand
now
i
know
you
did
mean
it
said
the
girl
scornfully
you
let
me
touch
that
nasty
old
doll
of
yours
again
for
nothin
you
would
she
shrilled
at
her
oh
yes
i
would
declared
phronsie
in
great
distress
see
i
going
to
get
her
now
and
she
turned
around
and
hurried
over
the
grass
to
pick
clorinda
off
from
her
and
run
back
there
see
little
girl
she
cried
breathlessly
thrusting
the
doll
into
the
dirty
hands
take
her
now
and
we
go
and
play
for
answer
the
girl
clutched
the
doll
and
sped
wildly
off
through
the
gateway
oh
cried
phronsie
running
after
with
pink
cheeks
and
outstretched
arms
give
me
back
my
child
stop
little
girl
but
there
wras
no
stop
to
the
long
thin
figure
flying
down
the
path
on
the
other
side
of
the
tall
hedge
it
was
a
back
passage
and
few
pedestrians
used
the
path
in
fact
there
were
none
on
it
this
afternoon
so
the
children
had
it
all
to
themselves
and
on
they
went
phronsie
with
but
one
thought
to
rescue
her
child
from
the
depths
of
woe
such
as
being
carried
off
by
a
strange
mother
would
produce
blindly
plunging
after
at
last
the
girl
with
the
doll
stopped
suddenly
flung
herself
up
against
a
stone
fence
and
drew
a
long
breath
well
what
you
goin
to
do
about
it
she
cried
defiantly
clutching
the
doll
with
a
savage
grip
phronsie
too
far
gone
for
words
sank
panting
down
to
the
curbstone
to
watch
her
with
wild
eyes
you
said
i
might
take
her
the
girl
blurted
out
i
hai
took
but
what
you
give
me
i
want
to
play
with
her
to
my
home
you
come
with
me
and
then
you
can
take
her
back
with
you
i
ca
said
phronsie
in
a
faint
little
voice
her
cheeks
were
very
red
and
she
wiped
her
hot
face
on
her
white
apron
you
must
give
me
clorinda
and
i
must
go
home
and
she
held
out
a
shaking
hand
but
the
girl
danced
off
and
phronsie
without
a
thought
beyond
the
rescue
of
her
child
stumbled
on
after
her
scarcely
seeing
one
step
before
her
for
the
tears
that
despite
all
her
efforts
now
began
to
stream
down
her
round
cheeks
at
last
in
trying
to
turn
out
for
a
baker
boy
with
a
big
basket
she
caught
her
foot
and
fell
a
tired
little
heap
flat
in
a
mud
puddle
in
the
middle
of
the
brick
pavement
my
eye
cried
the
baker
boy
lifting
her
up
here
you
girl
your
sister
fell
at
this
the
flying
girl
in
front
whirled
suddenly
and
came
running
back
and
took
in
the
situation
at
once
come
on
you
lazy
thing
you
she
exclaimed
then
she
burst
into
a
laugh
oh
how
you
look
give
me
back
panted
phronsie
rubbing
away
the
tears
with
her
muddy
hands
regardless
of
her
splashed
clothes
and
dirty
shoes
keep
still
ca
you
cried
the
girl
gripping
her
arm
as
two
or
three
pedestrians
paused
to
stare
at
the
two
come
on
sister
and
she
seized
phronsie
hand
and
bore
her
off
but
on
turning
the
corner
she
stopped
abruptly
and
still
holding
the
doll
closely
she
dropped
to
one
knee
and
wiped
off
the
tears
from
the
muddy
little
cheeks
with
a
not
ungentle
hand
you
got
to
be
my
sister
she
said
in
a
gush
else
the
hoodlums
will
tear
you
from
neck
to
heels
and
seizing
phronsie
hand
again
she
bore
her
off
dodging
between
rows
of
dwellings
that
if
her
companion
could
have
seen
would
have
certainly
proved
to
be
quite
novel
but
phronsie
was
by
this
time
quite
beyond
noticing
any
of
the
details
of
her
journey
and
after
turning
a
corner
or
two
she
was
hauled
up
several
flights
of
rickety
steps
strange
to
say
without
the
usual
accompaniment
of
staring
eyes
and
comments
of
the
various
neighbors
in
the
locality
there
the
girl
still
clutching
the
doll
flung
wide
the
rickety
door
my
ai
i
glad
to
get
here
though
and
she
drew
a
long
breath
releasing
phronsie
hand
who
immediately
slid
to
the
floor
in
a
collapsed
little
heap
well
this
is
my
home
ai
it
pretty
though
phronsie
thus
called
on
for
a
reply
tried
very
hard
to
answer
but
the
words
would
come
you
need
try
said
the
girl
slamming
the
door
likely
you
can
praise
it
enough
and
she
broke
out
into
a
hard
sarcastic
laugh
which
shrilled
its
way
out
of
the
one
window
whose
broken
glass
was
adorned
with
nondescript
fillings
see
here
now
you
all
beat
out
she
exclaimed
suddenly
then
rushing
across
the
room
she
dragged
up
a
broken
chair
and
jammed
it
against
the
door
there
now
we
by
ourselves
an
you
can
rest
i
must
go
home
said
phronsie
faintly
and
holding
up
her
tired
arms
give
me
my
child
i
must
go
home
did
you
think
i
did
know
what
was
proper
cried
the
girl
scornfully
and
tossing
her
head
i
going
to
have
tea

go
there
i
a
lady
an
a
swell
one
too
i
have
you
know
she
ran
over
to
the
corner
of
the
slatternly
room
and
set
the
doll
on
a
bed
over
which
were
tossed
the
clothes
in
a
dirty
heap
phronsie
following
every
movement
with
anxious
eyes
now
she
my
child
remember
she
said
turning
her
sharp
black
eyes
on
the
small
figure
huddled
up
on
the
floor
as
long
as
she
stays
here
then
she
hurried
about
twitching
a
box
out
here
and
there
from
a
cupboard
whose
broken
door
hung
by
one
hinge
here
my
silver
spoons
ai
they
beautiful
she
cried
running
up
with
a
few
forks
and
a
bent
and
battered
knife
these
she
placed
also
the
cracked
cups
with
great
gusto
on
the
rickety
table
propped
for
support
against
the
wall
as
one
of
its
legs
was
gone
entirely
and
another
on
the
fair
road
to
departure
stylish
to
have

at

she
tossed
her
head
with
its
black
elfish
locks
and
darted
off
in
triumph
dragging
up
from
another
corner
a
big
box
first
unceremoniously
dumping
out
the
various
articles
such
as
dirty
clothes
a
tin
pan
or
two
a
skillet
an
empty
bottle
last
of

old
nightcap
over

hair

ragged
strings
with
an
air
and
soon
by
dint
of
pulling
and
hauling

the
table
in
the
very
center
of
the
apartment

box
securely
under
its
most
delicate
and
unreliable

she
gave
a
flirt

ragged
gown

darted
here
and
there
with
her
elfish
movements
and
presently
a
cold
potato
shivering
in
its
skin
a
slice
or
two
of
hard
moldy
bread
and
some
turnips
and
carrots
uncooked
were
set
about
the
dirty
table
with
empty
spools
in
between
them

flowers
she
explained
as
she
put
the
articles
in
their
places
now
it
all

except
the
and
waving
an
old
tin
coffeepot
whose
nose
was
a
thing
of
the
past
she
filled
it
at
the
faucet
over
the
wooden
sink
and
put
it
down
with
a
flourish
at
one
end
of
the
table

out
phronsie
with
such
a
wail

screamed

best
chair
and
she
dragged
up
the
sole
article
of
furniture
of
that
name
minus
its
back
away
from
the
door
then
helping
phronsie
up
from
the
floor
she
wiped
off
the
tears
on
her
pinafore
no
longer
white
and
soon
had
her
installed
on
it
now
you
thereupon
she
ran
and
fetched
the
doll
from
the
bed
and
put
her
on
a
small
old
barrel
from
which
the
articles
were
dumped
out
and
with
a
box
for
her
back
clorinda
was
soon
in
great
state
on
one
side
of
the
feast
the
dukess
then
slipped
into
her
own
seat
an
inverted
tub
somewhat
low
to
be
sure
but
still
allowing
the
view
of
the
festive
cup
to
be
seen
she
my
child
now
will
you
have
some
with
a
winning
smile
that
ran
all
over
her
dirty
face
and
wrinkled
it
up
alarmingly
oh

she
my
child
protested
phronsie
the
tears
beginning
again
i

the
girl

she
demanded
abruptly
bringing
her
black
eyes
to
bear
on
phronsie
phronsie
could
hardly
stammer
it
out
for
the
tears
she
was
choking
back
oh

eye
what
a
name
laughed
the
dukess
in
derision
well

some
perlite
not

milk
said
phronsie
faintly
if
you
please
oh
no
trouble
said
the
dukess
airily
quirking
out
her
little
finger
with
grace
and
poising
the
tin
coffeepot
with
an
elegant
air
she
inverted
it
over
a
cracked
cup
which
when
generously
full
of
water
she
passed
to
her
guest
help
yourself
to
th
cakes
lady
fonsie
she
said
graciously
an
what
beyewtiful
weather
we
are
havin
phronsie
put
forth
a
trembling
hand
as
it
seemed
to
be
expected
of
her
and
took
the
cup
of
water
spilling
about
half
of
it
which
ran
off
the
and
down
her
little
brown
gown
the
dukess
greeting
this
mishap
with
a
shout
of
laughter
checking
it
suddenly
with
a
start
and
a
dismayed
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
broken
window
it
time
fer
you
to
talk
some
she
said
you
should
say
i
think
so
too
i
think
so
too
murmured
phronsie
viewing
her
cup
of
milk
gravely
an
you
must
say
think
dukess
you
have
the
most
splendid
milk
it
is
milk
said
phronsie
gravely
and
she
turned
serious
eyes
on
the
lady
of
quality
opposite
oh
yes
it
is
said
the
dukess
an
you
orter
go
on
an
say
all
them
perfectly
beyewtiful
flowers
i
never
see
any
so
fine
pointing
to
the
empty
spools
in
between
the
eatables
but
they
are
flowers
said
phronsie
this
occasioned
so
much
discussion
that
there
was
no
lack
of
conversation
and
was
the
reason
that
steps
over
the
stairway
were
not
heard
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
an
old
stout
sodden
woman
in
a
dirty
green
shawl
and
battered
bonnet
stood
transfixed
with
amazement
in
the
entrance
she
had
a
pleasant
eye
beneath
her
straggling
white
hair
and
her
first
words
were
not
altogether
agreeable
nor
appropriate
at
tea
so
this
is
the
way
she
said
gruffly
when
i
sends
you
out
rag
to
pick
up
somethin
you
eat
me
out
o
house
an
home
with
brats
you
bring
in
for
she
had
seen
through
the
dirt
on
phronsie
face
and
clothes
what
manner
of
child
was
present
the
dukess
twitched
off
the
nightcap
and
sprang
up
upsetting
the
tin
coffeepot
which
rolled
away
by
itself
and
put
herself
over
by
phronsie
covering
her
from
view
in
passing
she
had
grasped
the
doll
off
from
the
barrel
and
hidden
her
in
the
folds
of
her
tattered
gown
with
a
quick
sharp
thrust
nothin
i
do
have
some
fun
once
in
a
while
gran
she
grumbled
she
pinched
phronsie
arm
keep
still
and
while
the
old
woman
swayed
across
the
room
for
she
was
quite
free
from
the
effects
of
a
taste
from
a
bottle
under
her
arm
which
she
could
resist
trying
before
she
reached
home
phronsie
and
rag
were
working
their
way
over
toward
the
door
stop
roared
the
old
woman
at
them
in
a
fury
and
she
held
up
the
nightcap
involuntarily
rag
paused
through
sheer
force
of
habit
and
stood
paralyzed
till
her
grandmother
had
come
quite
close
hey
what
have
we
got
here
she
eyed
phronsie
sharply
oh
well
you
ai
acted
so
badly
after
all
maybe
the
pretty
little
lady
has
come
to
see
me
hey
and
she
seized
phronsie
small
arm
gran
cried
rag
hoarsely
waking
up
from
her
unlucky
paralysis
let
her
go
only
let
her
go
an
i
i
do
anythin
you
want
me
to
i
steal
an
pick
an
fetch
and
do
anything
gran
the
old
woman
leered
at
her
and
passed
her
hand
to
the
beads
on
neck
and
in
doing
so
she
let
the
little
arm
slip
that
she
might
use
both
hands
to
undo
the
clasp
the
better
one
second
of
time
but
rag
knowing
quite
well
what
could
be
done
in
it
seized
phronsie
rushed
outside
slammed
the
door
and
was
down
over
the
rickety
stairs
in
a
twinkling
through
the
dirty
courtyard
and
alley
which
luckily
had
few
spectators
and
those
thought
she
was
carrying
a
neighbor
child
around
a
corner
darting
here
and
there
till
presently
she
set
phronsie
down
and
drew
a
long
breath
oh
my
eye
she
panted
but
was
that
a
close
shave
though
ii
phronsie
there
now
here
you
are
there
was
a
little
click
in
the
girl
throat
phronsie
looked
up
yes
and
your
child
too
clorinda
and
all
her
pink
loveliness
was
thrust
into
her
own
little
mother
arms
and
the
sharp
black
eyes
peered
down
upon
the
two
i
brung
you
home
and
you
on
your
own
grassplot
same
you
were
still
she
stood
in
her
tracks

to
my
house
but
you
had
a
tea
and
now

she
did
not
stir
well
i
got
to
go
say
do

call
no
one
nor
tell
no
one
till
i
had
time
to
shake
my
feet
down
street
she
thrust
out
one
flapping
shoe
then
the
other
gave
a
scornful
laugh
and
brushed
her
hand
across
the
sharp
eyes
promise
now
black
and
blue
promise
true
hope
to
die
if
i
do
hurry
up

you
promise
she
cried
sharply
yes
said
phronsie
hugging
clorinda
tightly
all
right
now
for
gran
she
shut
her
teeth
tightly
and
was
off
and
through
the
big
gateway
i
got
my
child
said
phronsie
putting
up
a
sleepy
hand
to
pat
clorinda
head
but
it
fell
to
her
side
while
her
yellow
hair
slipped
closer
over
her
flushed
cheek
she
tried
to
say
clorinda
we
got
home
and
my
foots
are
tired
swayed
held
her
child
tighter
to
her
bosom
and
over
she
went
in
a
heap
fast
asleep
before
her
head
touched
the
soft
grass
polly
pepper
hurrying
home
from
alexia
ran
in
by
the
gateway
and
down
by
a
short
cut
over
the
grass
her
feet
keeping
time
to
a
merry
air
that
had
possessed
her
all
the
afternoon
how
fine
she
cried
to
herself
our
garden
party
will
be
and
we
gotten
on
splendidly
with
our
fancy
things
this
afternoon
it
will
be
too
perfectly
elegant
for
the
flying
feet
came
to
a
standstill
that
nearly
threw
her
over
the
sleeping
figure
the
doll
tightly
pressed
to
the
dirty
little
pinafore
and
the
flushed
cheeks
oh
my
goodness
me
cried
polly
down
on
her
knees
why
phronsie
just
look
at
your
pinafore
but
phronsie
had
no
idea
of
looking
at
anything
and
still
slept
on
dear
me
exclaimed
polly
in
consternation
whatever
in
the
world
has
she
been
doing
well
i
must
get
her
up
to
the
house
hullo
it
was
jasper
voice
polly
flew
up
to
her
feet
and
hulloed
back
he
took
a
short
cut
with
a
good
many
flying
leaps
across
the
grass
oh
polly
i
been
looking
for
you
just
see
there
cried
polly
pointing
tragically
to
the
little
heap
well
dear
me
said
jasper
why
polly
as
his
eyes
fell
on
the
soiled
pinafore
and
the
little
face
where
the
tears
had
made
muddy
streaks
i
know
it
said
polly
did
you
ever
in
all
this
world
jasper
what
do
you
suppose
she
has
been
doing
oh
making
mud
pies
perhaps
said
jasper
unwilling
to
worry
polly
do
look
so
polly
here
we
carry
her
to
the
house
said
polly
the
worry
dropping
out
of
her
eyes
at
the
fun
of
carrying
phronsie
in
but
phronsie
was
beyond
the
charms
of
or
her
yellow
head
bobbing
so
dismally
when
they
lifted
her
up
that
jasper
at
last
picked
her
up
in
his
arms
and
marched
off
with
her
you
bring
the
doll
polly
so
polly
ran
along
by
his
side
with
clorinda
dangling
by
one
arm
mother
fisher
said
never
a
word
when
she
received
her
baby
but
wisely
soothed
and
washed
and
tucked
her
away
in
bed
and
little
doctor
fisher
as
soon
as
he
got
home
viewed
her
critically
through
his
big
spectacles
and
said
the
child
is
all
right
let
her
sleep
which
she
did
until
every
one
of
the
household
creeping
in
and
out
declared
she
could
not
possibly
sleep
any
longer
and
that
they
must
wake
her
up
this
last
was
from
polly
what
do
you
suppose
it
is
mamsie
she
asked
for
about
the
fiftieth
time
hanging
over
phronsie
little
bed
nothing
said
fisher
with
firm
lips
polly
must
not
be
worried
by
unnecessary
alarm
and
really
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
amiss
with
phronsie
who
was
sleeping
peacefully
with
calm
little
face
and
even
breath
it
the
best
thing
for
her
to
sleep
till
she
rested
but
what
could
have
tired
her
so
said
polly
with
a
puzzled
face
that
just
what
we
ca
find
out
now
said
her
mother
diving
into
her
basket
for
another
of
van
stockings
oh
here
is
the
mate
when
she
wakes
up
she
tell
us
well
joanna
is
going
is
she
mamsie
asked
polly
deserting
the
little
bed
to
fling
herself
down
on
the
floor
at
fisher
feet
to
watch
the
busy
fingers
yes
she
is
said
mother
fisher
decidedly
i
so
very
glad
of
that
said
polly
with
a
sigh
of
relief
because
you
know
mamsie
she
might
go
off
again
and
leave
phronsie
when
she
ought
to
be
watching
her
say
no
more
about
it
polly
said
her
mother
setting
even
firm
stitches
for
king
is
very
angry
with
joanna
and
you
need
be
afraid
that
phronsie
will
ever
be
left
again
until
we
do
get
just
the
right
person
to
be
with
her
now
you
better
go
out
and
forget
it
all
and
busy
yourself
about
something
i
got
to
practice
said
polly
with
a
yawn
and
stretching
her
arms
i
have
done
a
bit
this
whole
afternoon
and
monsieur

then
said
fisher
smiling
at
her
so
polly
with
a
parting
glance
at
the
figure
on
the
little
bed
went
downstairs
and
into
the
big
wishing
that
phronsie
was
there
as
usual
where
she
dearly
loved
to
stay
tucked
up
in
a
big
chair
one
of
her
dolls
in
her
arms
waiting
patiently
till
the
practice
hour
should
be
over
but
when
phronsie
at
last
turned
over
and
said
without
a
bit
of
warning
i
want
something
to
eat
i
do
with
an
extremely
injured
expression
mother
fisher
was
so
thankful
that
she
had
no
time
to
question
her
if
indeed
she
had
considered
it
wise
to
do
so
and
sarah
was
called
and
laughed
with
delight
at
the
summons
and
ran
off
to
get
the
tray
ready
phronsie
watching
her
with
hungry
eyes
in
which
the
dew
of
sleep
still
lingered
but
old
king
was
not
so
patient
when
he
saw
as
he
soon
did
his
visits
to
the
side
of
the
little
bed
being
as
frequent
as
polly
own
that
phronsie
was
really
awake
and
sitting
up
he
could
keep
still
no
longer
but
putting
his
arms
around
her
fumed
out
oh
that
careless
joanna
poor
lamb
there
there
grandpapa
will

of

fisher
coming
up
with
a
dainty
white
gown
over
her
arm

said
holding

her
arms

old
king
very
much
delighted
and
lifting
her
up
to
rest
her
head
on
his
shoulder
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
there
there
dear
oh
why

that
sarah
hurry
when
in
walked
that
individual
with
a
big
tray
and
on
it
everything
that
a
hungry
child
could
be
supposed
to
desire
but
phronsie
had
no
eyes
for
anything
but
the
glass
of
milk
oh
grandpapa
she
piped
out
at
sight
of
it
sarah
got
me
some

little
crow

he
laughed
as
gayly
well
now
we

right
down
here
and

some
of
these
good
things
and
fisher
drawing
up
a
big
easy
chair
in
front
of
the
table
where
sarah
deposited
the
tray
he
sat
down
with
phronsie
on
his
knee
now
child

sarah
in
alarm
holding
up
warning
black
fingers

it
mos
all
up
there
there
phronsie
grandpapa
took
hold
of
the
glass
phronsie
said
mother
fisher
and
it
was
her
hand
that
took
the
glass
away
from
the
eager
lips
you
must
eat
a
roll
now
or
a
little
bit
of
toast
but

more
milk
said
phronsie
and
her
lips
quivered
not
yet
phronsie
mother
fisher
was
cutting
up
the
toast
and
now
held
up
a
morsel
on
the
spoon
see
how
very
nice
it
is

play
it

said
old
king
at
his
wit
end
to
bring
the
smiles
into
her
face
phronsie
turned
and
gave
him
one
look
then
buried
her
face
in
his
waistcoat
and
cried
as
hard
as
she
could
there
there
the
old
gentleman
got
up
to
his
feet
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
again
his
white
hair
bent
over
her
face
his
hand
patting
her
back
gently
do
cry
poor
little
lamb
and
as
a
sudden
thought
struck
him
just
look
at
your
mother
phronsie
you
are
making
her
sick
up
popped
phronsie
yellow
head
the
tears
trailing
off
from
the
round
cheeks
till
they
fell
on
the
floor
there
stood
mother
fisher
quite
still
i
sorry
mamsie
said
phronsie
and
she
put
out
a
little
hand
eat
the
toast
so
down
old
king
sat
again
with
her
on
his
lap
and
mother
fisher
cut
up
more
toast
and
phronsie
opened
her
mouth
obediently
and
after
the
first
mouthful
she
smiled
i
like
it
i
do
and
mother
fisher
smiled
too
and
said
i
knew
you
would
phronsie
and
grandpapa
laughed
he
was
so
happy
and
sarah
kept
crying
bress
de
lawd
yer
maw
knew
best
and
pretty
soon
fisher
nodded
to
old
king
and
he
said
now
for
the
rest
of
the
milk
phronsie
and
the
glass
was
put
into
her
happy
hand
and
then
more
toast
and
more
laughing
for
grandpapa
by
that
time
told
a
funny
story
and
everything
got
so
very
merry
that
the
gayety
brought
all
the
rest
of
the
houseful
of
children
up
to
see
if
phronsie
were
really
awake
why
did
you
tell
us
before
cried
joel
in
a
dudgeon
revolving
around
the
table
she
been
eating
ever
so
long
and
we
thought
she
was
asleep
that
the
reason
she
had
a
little
peace

the
old
gentleman

joel
in

satisfaction

with
a
warning
dig
in
his
ribs

alone
cried
joel
squaring
around
on
him
savagely
look
at
phronsie
face
said
percy
with
a
superior
manner
as
if
no
one
needed
to
tell
him
when
to
speak
polly
was
on
her
knees
cuddling
up
phronsie
toes
and
begging
to

her
when
she
felt
her
give
a
shiver
and
try
to
hide
her
face
on
her
neck
do
joey
begged
polly
but
joel
not
hearing
her
and
hating
to

dictated
to
by
percy

were
you
doing
all
the
morning
phronsie
at
this
gave
a
loud
sob
take

polly
was
all
she
said
so
polly
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
phronsie
snuggled
up
closer
into
her
neck
and
was
rocked
back
and
forth
to
her
heart
content
while
joel
perfectly
aghast
at
the
mischief
he
had
done
was
taken
in
tow
by
mother
fisher
to
sob
out
his
head
in
her
lap
that
he
did
mean
to

exclaimed
old

in
dismay

leaned
over
her
ca

up
something

an
inspiration
seizing
her
oh

ca
think
what
plans
we
have
for

phronsie
burrowed
deeper
in
her
nest
if

up
phronsie
said
polly
quite
decidedly

clutching

around

in
her
most
decided
fashion
so
you
must
sit
right
up
and
hear
all
about
it
now
jasper

begin
so
phronsie
sat
up
and
let
polly
wipe
her
face
and
then
she
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
while
jasper
began
you

that

the
wistaria
arbor
father
if

our
post
office

said
the
old
gentleman
who
would
have
been
quite
willing
to
promise
anything
just
then
oh
that
no
end
jolly
cried
jasper
throwing
back
his
dark
hair
from
his
forehead
with
a
quick
thrust
now
we
can
do
splendidly
polly
only
think
his
eyes
shone
and
polly
screamed
out
oh
grandpapa
how
lovely
and
the
others
joined
in
not
quite
knowing
what
they
were
so
happy
about
until
joel
popped
up
his
head
from
his
mother
lap
to
hear
what
all
the
noise
was
about
over
there
i
going
to
be
postmaster
he
announced
wiping
the
tears
off
with
the
back
of
his
hand
and
plunging
across
the
room
no
declared
ben
seizing
his
do
think
it
joe
jasper
is
going
to

that
important
office
yes
jasper

shouted
percy
and
van
together
delighted
at
anything
that
could
keep
joel
out
davie
stood
perfectly
still
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
why
could
joey
be
a
letter
carrier
to
help
give
out
the
letters
he
said
at
last
in
the
midst
of
the
noise
could
he
ben
and
he
ran
to
twitch
that
individual
sleeve
hey
what
could
he
be
the
one
to
give
out
some
of
the
letters
and
help
jasper
asked
david
anxiously
i
do
know
yes
maybe
as
he
saw
david
face
fall
you
best
ask
jasper
he
to
be
the
postmaster
so
david
ran
over
and
precipitated
himself
into
the
middle
of
the
group
with
his
question
when
immediately
the
rest
began
to
clamor
to
help
jasper
give
out
the
letters
so
the
babel
was
worse
than
at
first
phronsie
by
this
time
was
begging
with
the
others
while
she
sat
straight
in
polly
lap
with
very
red
cheeks
and
wide
eyes
now
she
slipped
out
and
rushed
up
to
jasper
and
i
too
japser
i
want
to
give
out
letters
too
she
cried
dreadfully
excited
so
you
shall
pet
he
cried
seizing
her
to
toss
her
up
in
the
air
the
others
all
circling
around
them
phronsie
happy
little
crows
going
up
high
above
the
general
din
well
i
think
if
we
are
going
to
have
such
a
fine
post
office
we
have
to
work
pretty
hard
to
write
the
letters
said
polly
after
they
had
sobered
down
a
bit
ugh
cried
joel
with
a
grimace
i
not
going
to
write
a
single
scrap
of
one
indeed
you
are
retorted
polly
everybody
has
absolutely
got
to
write
some
letters
why
we
must
have
a
bushel
of
them
oh
polly

cried
the
others
a
bushel
of
letters
and
no
one
can
have
a
letter
who
does
write
some
announced
polly
firmly
the
very
idea
so
we
must
all
work
like
everything
to
get
ready
for
the
post
office
iii
clem
forsythe
phronsie
sat
on
the
stairs
halfway
down
the
long
flight
it
was
the
same
staircase
on
which
jasper
had
found
her
with
polly
waiting
patiently
on
the
lower
step
when
she
first
came
to
grandpapa
king
now
she
held
clorinda
in
her
arms
tightly
pressed
to
her

i
do
wish

said
softly
that

my
poor
little

not
replying
phronsie
smoothed
down
the
pink
gown
it
was
very
nice
at
that
little
girl
house
and
a
troubled
expression
swept
over
her
face
but
the
little
girl
was
nice
and
she
had
any
child
clorinda
countenance
expressed
no
sorrow
but
stared
up
at
her
mother
unblinkingly
phronsie
bent
over
and
dropped
a
kiss
on
the
red
lips
maybe
she
come
again
some
day
if
i
watch
by
the
big

polly
running

threw
her
arms
around
the
small
figure
and
hugged
her
to
the
imminent

it
over
to

little
silk

i

and

i
gave

fair
and
her
mouth
drooped
sorrowfully
oh
yes
i
will
too
declared
clem
cheerfully
i
give
something
ten
times
better
than
that
old
dog
sitting
up
on
a
cushion
and
nobody
would
have
bought
it
when
it
was
done
except
my
mother
i
made
her
so
the
use
of
finishing
it
anyway
i
given
it
to
bridget
and
now
going
to
make
the
most
elegant
thing
you
ca
guess
polly
pepper
what
is
it
cried
polly
with
sparkling
eyes
oh
that
telling
said
clem
in
a
tantalizing
way
you
must
guess
polly
said
phronsie
with
a
gentle
little
twitch
on
her
arm
can
you
find
any
pink
ribbon
yes
yes
i
mean
no
not
yet
said
polly
in
a
preoccupied
way
her
eyes
on
clem
face
oh
i
ca
guess
it
might
be
anything
you
know
clem
but
it
is
i
mean
it
something
declared
clem
in
great
triumph
oh
do
hurry
you
so
slow
polly
it
too
elegant
for
anything
polly
leaned
her
face
in
her
hands
and
her
elbows
on
her
knees
mm
mm
oh
i
know
she
brought
up
suddenly
nearly
overthrowing
phronsie
who
had
bent
anxiously
over
her
take
care
pet
i
came
near
bumping
your
nose
it
a
workbag
a
workbag
exclaimed
clem
in
great
scorn
well
i
guess
not
polly
pepper
what
i
going
to
make
is
ever
so
much
better
than
an
old
workbag
guess
again
at
the
mention
of
the
workbag
phronsie
had
gently
pulled
polly
arm
but
polly
was
too
deep
in
thought
to
notice
and
she
wrinkled
her
brows
and
bent
her
head
again
in
her
hands
what
could
it
possibly
be
that
clem
was
to
make
well
i
think
it
is
a
sachet
bag
then
she
said
at
last
an
old
sachet
bag
when
all
the
girls
are
making
oceans
of
i
should
think
you
be
perfectly
ashamed
polly
pepper
to
sit
there
and
guess
such
things
i
going
to
make
a
most
beautiful
embroidered
handkerchief
case
with
little
violets
all
why
you
ca
clem
forsythe
polly
flew
to
her
feet
sending
the
ribbon
box
flying
and
nearly
oversetting
phronsie
you
ought
not
to
do
any
such
thing
she
ran
on
passionately
a
little
red
spot
coming
on
either
cheek
when
you
know
it
be
just
like
mine
it
would
be
too
mean
for
anything
it
wo
be
just
like
it
said
clem
twisting
uncomfortably
and
not
looking
up
into
polly
face
for
mine
is
to
be
a
wreath
and
yours
is
a
bunch
but
it
be
the
same
thing
cried
polly
too
angry
to
think
what
she
was
saying
and
you
perfectly
mean
and
hateful
to
copy
mine
polly
cried
phronsie
in
a
distressed
little
voice
she
had
gotten
up
to
her
feet
and
now
hurried
over
to
hold
polly
gown
oh
do
polly
do
go
away
commanded
polly
angrily
twitching
her
gown
free
you
know
what
you
are
doing
phronsie
to
stop
me
she
gone
and
chosen
the
very
thing
i
thought
of
all
by
myself
i
guess
there
are
other
violet
handkerchief
cases
in
the
shops
said
clem
coldly
she
was
getting
over
her
uncomfortable
fit
and
now
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
i
think
you
are
mean
and
stingy
too
polly
pepper
she
tossed
her
head
high
in
the
air
to
expect
to
keep
all
the
best
things
to
yourself
and
we
all
working
ourselves
most
to
death
over
this
old
fair
and
i
did
come
to
ask
you
to
go
with
me
to
buy
my
materials
mother
given
me
five
dollars
to
spend
just
as
i
like
but
i
sha
ask
you
now
so
there
she
gave
her
head
another
toss
and
walked
off
toward
the
door
phronsie
deserted
polly
and
ran
on
unsteady
little
feet
after
her
polly
is
mean
and
stingy
she
quavered
she
could
be
clem
looked
down
at
her
and
little
uncomfortable
thrills
ran
all
over
her
well
anyway
she
mad
at
me
she
said
with
great
decision
oh
no
polly
is
mad
declared
phronsie
she
clasped
her
hands
and
swallowed
very
hard
to
keep
the
tears
back
but
two
big
drops
escaped
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
when
clem
saw
those
she
turned
away
well
anyway
i
going
by
myself
she
said
without
a
backward
glance
at
polly
and
off
she
went
and
if
she
thinks
i
going
with
her
or
care
what
she
does
after
this
cried
polly
magnificently
with
her
head
in
the
air
she
make
a
mistake
polly
polly
the
tears
were
rolling
fast
now
and
phronsie
could
scarcely
see
to
stumble
back
across
the
room
to
her
side
and
you
do
know
anything
about
it
child
to
think
of
making
a
violet
handkerchief
case
and
mine
is
almost
done
and
none
of
the
girls
would
copy
mine
and
jasper
drew
the
flowers
on
purpose
she
was
going
on
so
fast
now
that
she
could
stop
herself
mamsie
would
like
it
wailed
phronsie
clear
gone
in
distress
now
and
hiding
her
face
in
polly
gown
mamsie
would
say
began
polly
decidedly
then
she
stopped
suddenly
oh
what
have
i
said
she
cried
oh
what
can
i
do
she
clasped
her
hands
tightly
together
she
was
now
in
as
much
distress
as
phronsie
and
seeing
this
phronsie
came
out
of
her
tears
at
once
you
might
run
after
her
she
said
oh
polly
do
she
wo
speak
to
me
said
polly
with
a
little
shiver
and
covering
her
eyes
oh
dear
dear
how
could
i
yes
she
will
i
do
believe
said
phronsie
putting
down
a
terrible
feeling
at
her
throat
not
speak
to
polly
such
a
thing
could
never
be
do
run
after
her
polly
she
begged
polly
took
down
her
hands
and
went
off
with
wavering
steps
to
the
door
i
get
your
hat
cried
phronsie
running
to
the
closet
but
polly
once
having
decided
to
make
the
attempt
at
a
reconciliation
was
off
her
brown
braids
flying
back
of
her
in
the
wind
iv
miss
taylor
working
bee
looking
both
sides
of
the
road
not
daring
to
think
what
she
would
say
if
she
really
did
see
clem
polly
sped
on
but
not
a
glimpse
of
the
tall
girl
figure
met
her
eyes
and
at
last
she
turned
in
at
a
gateway
and
ran
up
the
little
path
to
the
door
forsythe
saw
her
through
the
window
that
opened
on
the
piazza
why
polly
pepper
she
cried
what
a
pity
that
clem
did
find
you
she
went
over
to
your
house
oh
i
know
i
know
panted
polly
with
scarlet
cheeks

try
to
talk
said
forsythe
you
are
all
out
of
breath
come
in
polly
oh
i
ca
i
mean
i
would
like
to
see
clem
mumbled
polly
with
an
awful
dread
now
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
finding
her
of
what
she
should
say
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
keep
from
running
down
the
piazza
steps
and
fleeing
home
as
fast
as
she
had
come
why
clem
is
at
home
said
forsythe
in
a
puzzled
way
you
know
i
told
you
she
had
gone
over
to
your
house
she
wanted
you
to
go
with
her
to
buy
some
materials
to
take
over
to
miss
mary
this
afternoon
and
begin
something
new
for
the
fair
oh
said
polly
in
a
faint
voice
and
hanging
to
the
piazza
railing
you
see
she
was
all
tired
out
over
that
i
told
her
it
was
quite
too
ambitious
a
piece
to
do
and
she
was
so
discouraged
i
gave
her
some
more
money
and
advised
her
to
get
something
fresh
she
had
almost
made
up
her
mind
to
give
up
working
for
the
fair
altogether
oh
dear
me
gasped
polly
quite
overcome
yes
forsythe
leaned
comfortably
against
the
it
was
such
a
comfort
to
tell
her
worries
to
polly
pepper
clem
said
all
the
other
girls
were
making
such
pretty
things
and
it
was
no
use
for
her
to
try
she
ca
get
up
new
ideas
quickly
you
know
and
she
was
ashamed
not
to
take
in
something
nice
and
so
she
said
she
did
mean
to
do
anything
i
could
bear
to
have
her
give
it
up
for
she
ought
to
keep
with
you
girls
forsythe
face
fell
into
anxious
lines
she
gets
unhappy
by
herself
with
no
young
people
in
the
house
and
only
my
mother
and
me
to
brighten
her
up
so
i
talked
with
her
a
long
while
this
morning
and
at
last
got
her
to
be
willing
to
try
again
well
it
all
right
now
for
she
started
to
find
you
and
go
to
buy
the
things
and
mrs
forsythe
smiled
happily
polly
sank
to
the
piazza
steps
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
why
my
dear
are
you
ill
clem
mother
deserted
the
and
came
quickly
out
let
me
get
you
something
oh
no
no
polly
sprang
to
her
feet
and
hurried
down
the
steps
i
must
go
home
she
said
hoarsely
and
not
pausing
to
think
only
to
get
to
mamsie
she
sped
away
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
not
stopping
until
she
had
turned
in
at
the
little
green
where
she
would
be
likely
to
meet
any
one
oh
dear
dear
and
she
hurried
across
the
grass
supposing
mamsie
is
at
home
she
was
going
out
for
auntie
what
i
do
in
her
despair
she
raced
over
the
greensward
and
plunged
into
the
wistaria
arbor
to
stand
face
to
face
with
clem
polly
was
too
far
gone
in
distress
to
say
anything
clem
jerked
up
her
head
from
the
table
and
raised
a
defiant
pair
of
cheeks
wet
and
miserable
oh
dear
dear
was
all
polly
could
get
out
but
she
stumbled
in
and
put
her
arms
around
her
neck
and
down
went
the
two
heads
together
i
awfully
sorry
blubbered
clem
oh
dear
i
forgot
my
handkerchief
take
mine
polly
put
a
wet
little
wad
into
her
hand
oh

that
handkerchief

positively
if

clem
forsythe
it

in
me
to

clem
beginning
to
sniffle
again
now
that
she
had
a
handkerchief
oh
no

polly
in
alarm
now
i
know
you
wo

me
when

my
fault

to

keep
it
to
myself
you
are
ever
mean
polly
pepper
clem
hugged
her
so
tightly
by
the
neck
that
the
neat
little
ruffle
mamsie
sewed
in
that
very
morning
was
quite
crushed
when
she
saw
that
clem
was
in
worse
distress
than
ever
see
here
why
clem
forsythe
polly
pepper
flew
up
to
her
feet
so
suddenly
that
clem
started
in
amazement
and
stared
at
her
as
well
as
she
could
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
why
ca
you
see
have
we
been
two
goosies
geese
i
mean
not
to
think
of
it
before
what
asked
clem
helplessly
why
you
might
make
a
violet
case
said
polly
in
a
burst
then
she
began
to
dance
around
the
arbor
oh
clem
how
perfectly
lovely
i
do
see
began
clem
dismally
and
i
do
know
how
to
make
a
glove
case
why
make
it
just
like
my
handkerchief
case
only
long
flung
polly
over
her
shoulder
as
she
danced
away
but
i
do
want
to
copy
yours
protested
clem
for
it
really
would
be
mean
but
this
would
make
a
set
yours
and
mine
said
polly
breathlessly
and
coming
up
to
shake
the
downcast
shoulders
do
you
see
oh
you
goosie
and
i
been
another
not
to
think
of
it
before
and
oh
such
a
set
why
it
would
sell
for
a
lot
of
money
and
i
ask
jasper
to
draw
you
the
same
kind
of
bunch
of
violets
on
your
glove
case
and
we
go
right
now
i
can
make
phronsie
bag
when
i
get
home
come
on
when
clem
once
had
the
idea
in
her
mind
she
got
off
from
the
bench
and
phronsie
watching
anxiously
from
polly
window
for
her
return
saw
the
two
girls
hurrying
across
the
lawn
their
arms
around
each
other
and
talking
busily
and
it
was
but
a
moment
or
two
and
she
was
flying
over
the
grass
to
meet
them
polly
had
explained
that
the
little
ribbon
bag
was
to
be
made
just
as
soon
as
the
materials
for
the
new
glove
case
were
bought
polly
had
run
up
for
her
hat
and
to
get
her
little
purse
for
she
just
remembered
that
her
green
silk
for
the
violet
stems
was
nearly
out
and
phronsie
had
said
and
gone
back
to
the
house
on
happy
feet
to
tell
clorinda
and
watch
at
the
window
till
polly
should
come
again
and
just
after
luncheon
for
they
must
start
early
in
order
to
have
a
good
long
afternoon
at
miss
mary
polly
and
phronsie
set
forth
the
new
little
bag
hanging
from
phronsie
arm
jasper
went
with
them
as
far
as
the
corner
where
he
turned
off
to
go

so
that
he

trooped
in
going
up
into
miss
pretty
room
to
take
off
their
things
and
presently
the
big
library
with
the
adjoining
was
filled
with
the
gay
young
people
and
the
bustle
and
chatter
began
at
once
i
should
think

be
driven
wild
by
them
all
wanting
you
at
the
same
minute
dyce
having
that
desire
at
this
identical
time
naturally
felt
a
bit
impatient
as
miss
mary
went
about
inspecting
the
work
helping
to
pick
out
a
stitch
here
and
to
set
a
new
one
there
admiring
special
bit
of
prettiness
and
tossing
a
smile
and
a
gay
word
in
every
chance
moment
between
oh
no
said
miss
mary
with
a
little
laugh
they
most
of
them
my
scholars
you

that

the
more
reason
that
you

he
pushed
up
an
into
a
then
drew
up
an
ottoman
on
which
he
sat
down
oh
look
at
that
dyce
said
clem
quite
in
a
flow
of
spirits
as
she
threaded
her
needle
with
a
strand
of
violet
silk
he
going
to
keep
miss
mary
off
there
all
to
himself
what

him
come
this
afternoon

cried
alexia
rhys
twitching
her
pink
worsted
with
an
impatient
hand
horrors
now
i
gone
and
gotten
that
into
a
precious
snarl
the
very
idea
she
our
teacher
oh
miss
mary
she
called
suddenly
miss
taylor
just
sitting
down
in
the
turned
what
is
it
alexia
while
dyce
frowned
at
which
alexia
laughed
over
at
him

me
about

work
she
begged
you
little
tyrant
called
dyce
as
miss
mary
went
over
do
i
slip
one
stitch
and
then
knit
two
asked
alexia
innocently
polly
next
to
her
on
a
cricket
opened
wide
eyes
yes
said
miss
mary
just
the
same
as
you
have
been
knitting
all
along
alexia
well
i
could
think
of
anything
else
to
ask
said
alexia
coolly
then
she
laid
hold
of
miss
mary
pretty
gray
gown
oh
do
go
back
to
him
she
implored
do
stay
with
us
girls
we
all
your
class
that
is
most
of
us
stay
with
us
miss
mary
miss
mary
cast
an
imploring
glance
over
at
the
gentleman
which
he
seemed
to
see
although
apparently
he
was
looking
phronsie
you
and
i
will
have
to
move
over
i
think
for
by
this
time
he
had
her
in
his
lap
and
so
he
bundled
her
across
the
room
unceremoniously
oh
i
lost
my
needle
cried
phronsie
peering
out
from
his
arms
in
great
distress
dear
me
exclaimed
dyce
so
he
set
her
down
and
dropped
to
to
peer
about
for
the
shining
little
implement
phronsie
getting
down
on
her
knees
to
assist
the
search
alexia
seeing
the
trouble
deserted
her
knitting
and
flew
out
of
her
chair
to
help
look
for
it
you
little
tyrant
exclaimed
dyce
as
she
added
herself
to
the
group
to
call
miss
mary
over
there
i
should
think
it
was
quite
bad
enough
to
have
you
sundays
alexia
miss
mary
thinks
a
great
deal
of
me
said
alexia
composedly
dear
me
what
a
plaguey
little
thing
that
needle
is
never
mind
phronsie
feel
badly
i
guess
oh
here
it
is
and
sticking
straight
up
and
all
this
would
never
have
happened
but
for
your
calling
miss
mary
away
observed
dyce
getting
up
straight
again
what
a
little
nuisance
you
are
alexia
all
of
which
she
had
heard
from
him
so
many
times
before
that
it
failed
to
disturb
her
so
she
went
back
to
her
seat
in
high
spirits
phronsie
hopping
over
like
a
small
rabbit
to
a
little
cricket
at
polly
feet
at
this
there
was
a
bustle
among
the
girls
sit
next
to
me
miss

begged
silvia
horne
sweeping

amy
garrett

alexia
decidedly
when
i
asked
her
to

across
the
room
i
going
to
sit
next
to
her
of
course

laughed
hamilton
dyce
since
there
be
one
long
fight
over
you
better
come
back
but
miss
mary
protesting
that
the
girls
needed
her
finally
settled
it
by
getting
her
chair
into
the
middle
of
the
group
which
she
made
into
a
circle
there
now
we
all
comfy
together
she
announced
now
dyce

alexia
who
did
relish
listening
to

and
all
took
it
up
even
phronsie
laid
down
her
big
needle
which
she
was
patiently
dragging
back
and
forth
with
a
very
long
piece
of
red
worsted
following
its
trail
across
the
face
of
her
in
a
way
to
suit
her
own
design
to
beg
for
the
story
oh
phronsie
exclaimed
polly
for
the
first
time
catching
sight
of
this

such
a
long
thread

in
alarm
why

polly
in
concern

me
take

little
just
a
little
teenty
bit
phronsie

phronsie
decidedly
i
must
hurry
and

she
thinks
she

it
done
faster
with
a
great
long
thread
giggled
one
of
the
girls
over
in
the
corner
dyce
turning
to
fix
her
with
a
stare
she
subsided
ducking
behind
her
neighbor
back
phronsie
i
must
buy
that
at
the
fair
he
announced
i
want
such
an
one
very
much
indeed
phronsie
got
off
from
the
little
cricket
where
he
had
placed
her
and
went
straight
over
to
him
to
lay
her
hand
with
the
in
it
on
his
knee
then
i
will
sell
it
to
you
she
said
gravely
and
the
poor
children
can
go
into
the
country
then
she
went
back
to
her
seat
and
took
up
her
work
once
more
some
of
the
girls
laughed
but
alexia
frowned
furiously
at
them
and
dyce
and
miss
mary
apparently
seeing
no
amusement
in
it
they
all
began
to
beg
for
the
story
again
till
the
clamor
bade
fair
to
stop
the
needles
from
doing
their
work
i
guess
you
have
to
miss
mary
smiled
over
at
him
from
the
center
of
the
circle
while
the
color
deepened
on
her
cheek
i
want
a
story
told
to
me
first
he
said
coolly
leaning
back
in
his
chair
what
is
all
this
bee
for
and
this
fair
i
know
just
a
hint
about
that
but
let
me
have
the
whole
story
from
beginning
to
end
now
then
some
one
tell
me
i
am
very
anxious
to
hear
you

polly
cried
alexia
and
let
polly
pepper
tell
ca
she
miss
mary
begged
all
the
girls
every
one
saying
the
same
thing
so
miss
mary
said
yes
and
polly
laid
down
her
violet
handkerchief
case
in
her
lap
although
she
hated
to
stop
working
and
began
you
see
miss
mary
said
one
day
in
oh
polly

said
miss
taylor
in
dismay

on
polly
and

i
to

told
the
whole
story
from
the
very
beginning
now
mind
you
said
day
in
now
go
on
yes
said
polly
her
cheeks
like
a
rose
for
fear
her
dear
miss
mary
might
not
like
it
miss
mary
said
we
ought
to
be
doing
things
not
always
talking
about
them
and
learning
how
to
be
good
and
she
said
there
were
so
many
poor
children
who
were
waiting
for
us
to
help
them
and
polly
you
do
need
to
tell
that
he
wants
to
know
about
the
fair
miss
taylor
broke
in
suddenly
oh
dear
said
poor
polly
blushing
rosier
than
ever
and
moving
her
cricket
so
that
she
need
not
see
miss
mary
face
while
dyce
protesting
that
he
was
not
to
be
cheated
out
of
a
single
word
of
the
narration
made
her
go
back
and
tell
over
the
last
thing
she
said
this
was
so
much
worse
that
miss
mary
decided
she
would
let
the
story
go
on
at
all
hazards
so
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
resignedly
while
polly
went
on
well
and
so
we
said
miss
mary
we
like
to
and
what
could
we
do
for
we
did
know
how
to
help
poor
children
and
i
said
i
did
want
to
broke
in
alexia
suddenly
but
you
did
alexia
cried
polly
whirling
around
on
her
cricket
to
regard
her
affectionately
oh
dyce
she
did
help
looking
over
at
him
anxiously
oh
yes
i
see
nodded
that
gentleman
and
she
working
on
some
fandango
for
the
fair
just
as
hard
as
you
other
girls
oh
this
horrible
old
shawl
said
alexia
regarding
the
worsted
folds
dangling
from
her
needle
with
anything
but
favor
well
i
did
want
it
and
nobody
will
buy
it
i
know
but
the
other
girls
were
all
going
to
do
things
so
i
had
to
well
go
on
polly
said
dyce
with
a
laugh
so
polly
quite
satisfied
that
he
really
understood
how
alexia
was
helping
along
the
work
for
the
poor
children
the
same
as
the
others
hurried
on
with
the
story
well
so
then
miss
mary
proposed
that
we
hold
a
fair
and
grandpapa
said
we
might
have
it
on
his
grounds
and
auntie
whitney
said
why
not
have
a
garden
party
and
sell
tickets
for
perhaps
some
people
would
care
to
buy
things
and
and
i
going
to
put
my
on
the
table
piped
phronsie
suddenly
her
checks
all
aglow
with
excitement
and
dropping
her
needle
again
so
you
shall
cried
dyce
only
you
must
have
a
little
card
saying
on
it
for
i
am
surely
going
to
buy
that
pincushion
phronsie
and
then
polly
flew
back
to
her
work
again
and
dyce
told
such
a
very
funny
story
about
some
monkeys
who
were
going
to
give
a
party
in
the
woods
to
all
the
other
animals
that
phronsie
forgot
all
about
her
needle
and
ran
over
to
clamber
up
into
his
lap
and
then
oh
the
needles
flew
and
clem
green
stems
began
to
grow
and
a
tiny
bud
showed
itself
and
then
a
violet
and
alexia
pink
shawl
took
ever
so
many
rows
and
all
the
work
seemed
to
flourish
like
magic
and
at
last
miss
mary
looked
up
at
the
clock
time
to
put
up
work
girls
she
cried
gayly
and
then
was
there
a
great
bustle
every
one
trying
to
see
which
would
get
hers
into
her
bag
first
and
then
oh
such
a
stretching
of
tired
arms
and
feet
oh
dear
me
the
prickles
are
all
running
up
and
down
my
legs
exclaimed
alexia
hush
well
so

declared
clem

laughed
another
girl
come
miss
mary
was
telling
dyce
to
lead
the
way
to
the
so
they
all
fell
into
line
and
when
there
they
forgot
tired
legs
and
arms
in
the
delights
of
the
little
feast
set
out
miss
mary
sat
down
by
the
small
table
and
poured
chocolate
for
them
a
maid
at
her
chair
hamilton
dyce
on
the
other
side
as
grand
helper
then
the
girls
settled
down
in
pretty
groups
on
the
broad
and
on
the
chairs
and
gave
themselves
up
to
the
supreme
content
of
the
hour
and
then
miss
mary
proposed
that
they
should
wind
up
the
afternoon
with
a
dance
which
was
received
with
a
shout
of
delight
so
she
led
the
way
to
the
and
sat
down
before
the
grand
piano
ca
one
of
you

said
alexia
rushing
after
polly
into
the
library
and
getting
down
on
her
knees
to
prowl
over
the
floor
misery
me
with
a
jump
i
found
it
already
sticking
straight
into
me
so
phronsie
was
thrust
into
the
gay
little
workbag
and
polly
danced
out
with
it
and
handed
it
up
to
her

whip
and
this
time
they

fairly
off
v
she
my
little

phronsie
as
they
ran
along
the
hollyhock
path
that
my
poor
little
girl
could
go
to
the
country
ca
she
polly
she
asked
anxiously
oh
yes
of
course
assented
polly
her
mind
on
the
garden
party
now
only
three
days
ahead
phronsie
how
perfectly
elegant
those
roses
are
going
to
be
pointing
off
to
the
varieties
blooming
riotously
oh
polly
phronsie
stood
still
a
moment
in
silent
bliss
then
hopped
up
and
down
the
narrow
path
i
so
glad
she
can
go
oh
polly
i
so
glad
who
cried
polly
in
perplexity
my
little
girl
my
poor
little
girl
said
phronsie
hopping
away
oh
of
course
polly
gave
a
little
laugh
well
there
are
lots
of
poor
little
girls
who
will
go
phronsie
she
said
in
great
satisfaction
because
you
know
we
going
to
make
a
great
deal
of
money
i
expect
why
grandpapa
has
told
thomas
to
buy
ever
so
many
flowers
just
think
child
and
the
oceans
we
have
here
she
waved
her
hands
over
to
take
in
not
only
the
garden
where
they
stood
but
the
smart
beyond
the
pride
and
joy
of
the
gardeners
oh
yes
there
will
be
ever
so
many
children
who
will
be
happy
in
the
country
in
the
summer
and
my
poor
little
girl
persisted
phronsie
gleefully
she
will
be
happy
polly
oh
let
go
down
to
the
big
gate
she
there
now
and
tell
her
please
polly
she
seized
polly
hand
in
great
excitement
polly
sank
to
her
knees
in
delight
over
a
little
bed
of
daisies
i
do
think
these
are
the
very
sweetest
things
phronsie
pepper
she
said
see
the
cunning
baby
ones
coming
out
please
polly
begged
phronsie
clinging
to
her
hand
why
phronsie
polly
looked
up
in
amazement
not
to
pay
attention
to
the
baby
daisies
was
certainly
astonishing
when
phronsie
was
always
so
rapt
over
the
new
flowers
what
is
it
you
want
child
please
come
down
to
the
big
gate
polly
pleaded
phronsie
her
lip
quivering
for
polly
was
not
usually
so
hard
to
understand
yes
i
will
said
polly
reluctantly
tearing
herself
away
from
the
fascinating
daisies
now
then
we
go
there
right
away
one
two
three
and
away
i
guess
she
be
there
panted
phronsie
but
she
was
running
so
fast
to
keep
up
with
polly
longer
steps
that
her
words
died
away
on
the
air
and
polly
who
dearly
loved
a
race
over
the
grass
was
letting
her
mind
travel
to
the
delights
of
the
garden
party
and
what
it
was
going
to
accomplish
so
she
did
hear
at
last
there
was
the
big
gate
dear
me
cried
polly
with
a
gay
little
laugh
what
a
fine
race
no
wonder
you
wanted
me
to
try
it
with
you
why
pet
have
i
run
too
fast
she
looked
with
remorse
at
the
flushed
little
face
no
gasped
phronsie
but
oh
polly
will
you
sit
down
on
the
grass
to
be
sure
i
will
said
polly
very
remorsefully
you
all
tired
out
there
let
come
over
here
and
she
led
her
over
to
the
very
tree
under
which
phronsie
had
fallen
asleep
here
where
i
found
you
the
other
day
phronsie
when
you
were
so
tired
and
polly
threw
herself
down
on
the
grass
and
drew
phronsie
into
her
lap
she
come
said
phronsie
and
the
sorrowful
look
began
to
disappear
as
she
cuddled
in
polly
arms
do
you
believe
she
will
polly
she
put
her
face
close
to
polly
to
peer
anxiously
into
her
brown
eyes
who
child
asked
polly
the
poor
little
girl
my
poor
little
girl
exclaimed
phronsie
oh
there
is
any
little
girl
at
least
any
particular
one
cried
polly
we
going
to
send
ever
so
many
little
girls
into
the
country
phronsie
but
not
any
special
one
oh
yes
there
is
contradicted
phronsie
her
lip
quivering
again
and
despite
all
her
efforts
the
big
tears
began
to
course
down
her
cheeks
she
my
little
girl
and
i
like
her
please
let
her
go
polly
and
maybe
she
come
soon
if
we
only
wait
for
her
it
was
a
long
speech
and
by
the
time
it
was
all
out
phronsie
had
laid
her
head
in
polly
neck
and
was
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
it
was
for
this
reason
that
polly
did
not
happen
to
look
up
across
the
grass
to
the
big
gate
so
of
course
she
could
be
expected
to
see
what
took
place
there
and
it
was
not
until
phronsie
had
been
persuaded
to
sit
straight
and
have
her
tears
wiped
away
because
mamsie
would
like
to
have
her
cry
that
any
one
guessed
it
at
all
and
in
one
instant
lap
was
deserted
phronsie
was
flying
over
the
greensward
crying
out
there
she
is
my
poor
little
girl
it
took
but
a
moment
for
polly
swift
feet
to
follow
but
none
too
soon
for
the
thin
little
face
with
the
sharp
black
eyes
was
withdrawn
and
the
flapping
old
shoes
were
beating
a
hasty
retreat
but
polly
was
after
her
and
her
hand
was
on
her
arm
and
the
first
thing
the
stranger
knew
she
was
drawn
within
the
big
gateway
phronsie
circling
around
her
with
great
satisfaction
she
come
polly
she
did
lem
me

the
girl
trying
to
wriggle

from

going
to

but

the
tattered

long
breath

visited

me
she
took
hold
of
her

arm
and

and
wholly
bewildered

and
tucked
it
softly
under
his
chin
he
seized
it
and
covered
it
with
kisses
oh
my
lamb
that
wicked
careless
joanna

matter
grandpapa
phronsie
brought
up
her
head
to

troubled
eyes

grandpapa
cooed
phronsie
wriggling
her
toes
happily
yes
dear
grandpapa
said
phronsie
after
a
moment
silence
only
broken
by
a
soft
murmur
of
voices
for
mother
fisher
had
drawn
her
group
to
the
further
corner
i
do
think
my
little
girl
has
got
a
very
nice
place
to
live
in
oh
phronsie
child
he
strained
her
convulsively
to
his
breast
there

did
mean
to
grandpapa
wo

his
little
pet
for
the
world

as

hair
of
your
blessed
head
oh
that
dreadful
joanna

said
phronsie
dismissing
her
own
hurts
to
go
on
with
her
narrative
yes
i

grandpapa
she
added
decidedly
but
i
do
like
the
place
she
lived
in
and
grandpapa
here
she
drew
a
long
breath
there
was
an
old
lady
came
in
and
i
do
think
she
was
a
nice
old
lady
i
do
grandpapa
phronsie
crept
up
a
bit
closer
if
that
were
possible
what
did
she
do
child
he
held
his
breath
for
the
answer
she
took
hold
of
my
arm
said
phronsie
a
shiver
seizing
her
at
the
remembrance
and
she
burrowed
deeper
within
the
protecting
arms
and
she
felt
of
my
beads
that
auntie
gave
me
what
else
he
scarcely
seemed
to
ask
the
question
and
my
own
little
girl
pulled
me
away
and
she
carried
me
home
most
of
the
way
and
i
like
her
phronsie
brought
herself
up
with
an
emphatic
little
nod
and
smiled
that

oh

she
she
my
own
little
girl
we
see
about

said
old
king
with
a
thought
of
the
long
welts
on
the
thin
arms
and
the
furious
old
woman
what
that
noise
asked
phronsie
suddenly
lifting
her
head
oh
a
bird
maybe
said
the
old
gentleman
carelessly
looking
up
to
the
vines
swinging
around
the
veranda
there
lay
your
head
down
again
child
it
did
sound
like
a
bird
grandpapa
i
thought
some
one
was
crying
yet
she
put
her
yellow
head
obediently
down
and
did
lift
it
again
till
mother
fisher
stood
by
the
side
of
old
king
chair
well
is
the
conference
over
he
asked
yes
said
pepper
her
lips
had
a
little
white
line
around
them
too
like
that
on
polly
mouth
and
the
black
eyes
had
a
strange
expression
phronsie
popped
her
head
up
like
a
bird
out
of
its
nest
and
piped
out
oh
please
mamsie
may
she
stay
yes
said
mother
fisher
she
is
going
to
stay
phronsie
oh
my
goodness
me
breathed
old
king
phronsie
slipped
out
of
his
arms
and
began
to
dance
clapping
her
hands
i
going
to
play
with
her
now
but
i
must
get
clorinda
first
she
cried
excitedly
see

phronsie
mother
fisher
called
as
she
was
flying
off
you
must
not
play
with
the
little
girl
yet
phronsie
stood
quite
still
come
here
to
mother
fisher
opened
her
arms
and
phronsie
scuttled
into
them
like
a
little
rabbit
pepper
held
her
so
closely
that
phronsie
looked
up
quickly
why
you
are
hurting
me
like
grandpapa
mamsie
oh
my
child
mother
fisher
seemed
to
forget
herself
as
she
bowed
her
head
over
phronsie
yellow
hair
what
is
the
matter
mamsie
asked
phronsie
i
wish
i
could
see
your
face
and
she
wriggled
violently
nothing
is
the
matter
now
said
mamsie
there
child
now
i
tell
you
if
the
little
girl
stays
here
she
she
my
little
girl
interrupted
phronsie
well
if
she
stays
here
she
must
be
washed
and
have
on
clean
clothes
so
sarah
has
taken
her
and
is
going
to
fix
her
all
up
nice
oh
oh
cried
phronsie
in
a
transport
and
can

have
some
of
clothes
mamsie
yes
i
guess
so
anyway
we
will
fix
her
up
all
nicely
and
may
she
stay
here
for

and
ever
cried
phronsie
and
not
go
back
to
that
old
lady
please
mamsie
do
let
her
go
back
she
pleaded
over
the
yellow
hair
the
old
gentleman
had
found
out
and
communicated
several
things
back
and
forth
one
was
i
do
think
she
is
the

grandmother
cabot

and
so
on
what

asked
phronsie

now
i

phronsie
you

phronsie
said
the
old
gentleman
for
i

hair

want
to
be
smoothed
after
all

and
take
care
of
you
grandpapa
said
phronsie
delighted
that

called
for
and
with
her
heart
at

about
her
own
poor
little
girl
vi
grandma

little

and

went
swiftly
up
the
path
between
the
lilac
bushes
it
a
beautiful
day
mrs
bascom
hey
grandma
shaking
hand
went
up
to

of

childern
went
away
come
in
an
set
down
and
she
led
the
way
into
the
kitchen
meanwhile
the
hens
seeing
nothing
to
prevent
it
had
employed
the
time
in
slipping
in
under
grandma
short
gown
and
were
busily
scratching
around
for
any
stray
bits
thank
you
the
parson
wife
nimbly
found
a
chair
while
grandma
bustled
into
the
bedroom
excuse
me
a
minute
mis
henderson
she
called
i
goin
to
slip
on
cap
oh
do
take
the
trouble
said
henderson
pleasant
voice
but
she
might
as
well
have
said
nothing
for
grandma
did
hear
a
word
proper
to
see
your
minister
wife
in
your
mornin
cap
nor
your
petticoat
neither
for
that
matter
said
grandma
to
herself
looking
down
at
her
short
gown
so
she
concluded
to
put
on
her
gown
as
she
called
her
best
dress
this
took
her
so
long
because
she
hooked
it
up
wrong
three
times
that
henderson
appeared
in
the
doorway
before
the
operation
of
could
be
said
to
be
finished
i
very
sorry
she
began
a
bit
o
trouble
said
grandma
cheerfully
pulling
at
the
second
hook
which
she
had
been
trying
for
some
time
to
get
into
the
first
eye
you
set
down
mis
henderson
an
i
be
out
pretty
soon
i
must
go
very
soon
the
parson
wife
came
quite
close
to
say
this
up
under
the
frill
of
the
best
cap
which
stood
out
very
stiffly
as
grandma
always
kept
it
in
a
covered
box
on
top
of
her
high
bureau
hey
i
must
go
home
soon
i
have
so
many
things
to
see
to

a
fatally
long
speech
for

attended
to
the
last
part
it
i
know
it
i
comin
soon
i
can
git
this
hooked
up
with
another
pull
at
the
mismated
hooks
and
eyes
seeing
this
in
despair
the
parson
wife
took
the
matter
of
hooking
up
into
her
own
hands
and
before
long
the
gown
could
be
said
to
be
fairly
on
now
that
something

grandma
in
great
satisfaction
i

child
henderson

being
sparing
of
words
i
some
letters
from

she
said
loudly
and
if

out
to
the
kitchen
i
will
stay
and
read

grandma
in
alarm

pepper

they

to

what

and
three
letters
to

she
wo
hear
a
word
but
grandma
having
caught
the
word
letters
knew
quite
well
what
was
in
store
so
picking
up
her
best
gown
by
its
side
breadths
she
waddled
out
and
seated
herself
with
great
dignity
in
a
big
chair
by
the
kitchen
window
it
was
next
to
the
little
stand
in
whose
drawer
she
used
to
let
joel
pepper
look
for
peppermints
when
the
pepper
children
shut
up
the
little
brown
house
to
go
to
king
grandma
moved
the
small
mahogany
stand
from
its
place
next
to
the
head
of
her
bed
out
into
the
kitchen
she
kept
her
big
bible
on
it
and
her
knitting
work
where
she
could
have
handy
and
it
made
her
feel
less
lonesome
to
look
up
from
her
work
to
see
it
standing
there
seem
though
that
boy
was
in
every
minute
she
said
my
land
o
goshen
do
i
wish
he
was
for
grandma
always
had
a
soft
spot
in
her
heart
for
joel
now
she
smoothed
down
her
front
breadth
and
folded
her
hands
in
a
company
way
the
parson
wife
drew
up
a
kitchen
chair
close
to
her
side
and
unfolded
the
first
letter
who
writ
that
asked
grandma
eagerly
that
from
polly
said
henderson
bless
her
heart
cried
grandma
well
what
does
she
say
ma
a
serious
boy
appeared
in
the
doorway
pa

announced
oh

exclaimed
the
parson
wife
in
consternation
at
his
appearance
and
oh

the
same
breath
i
so
sorry

grandma
supposing

blessed
little
creeter
has
got
hurt
an
they
would
let
me
know
afore
the
rest
it

in
the
letter
declared
henderson
in
a
loud
hasty
tone
hurrying
out
of
her
chair
peletiah
what
does
your
father
want
do
you
know
i
do
know
exactly
said
peletiah
deliberately
only
aunt
jerusha
tumbled
down
the
cellar
stairs
maybe
that
it
oh
dear
me
dear
me
cried
the
parson
wife
in
a
great
fright
peletiah
here
are
the
letters
from
the
pepper
children
thrusting
them
into
his
hand
do
you
stay
and
read
them
to
grandma
and
be
sure
to
tell
her
why
i
went
home
and
she
actually
ran
out
of
the
kitchen
and
down
the
path
peletiah
left
alone
with
the
letters
turned
them
over
and
over
in
his
hands
as
he
stood
quite
still
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
floor
he
never
thought
of
disobeying
and
presently
he
pulled
up
another
chair
just
in
front
of
grandma
and
sat
slowly
down
oh
i
know
she
got
hurted
bad
she
kept
groaning
an
i
sha
never
see
her
again
oh
the
pretty
creeter
hai
she
hurted
bad
she
asked
anxiously
bringing
her
cap
frills
to
bear
on
the
boy
in
front
yes
i
guess
so
said
peletiah
cheerfully
she
fell
way
down
all
over
the
cat
sitting
on
the
stairs
where
you
say
she
fell
screamed
grandma
cellar
stairs
peletiah
raised
his
voice
too
and
sprawled
out
his
hands
to
show
how
his
aunt
jerusha
must
have
descended
oh
me
oh
my
exclaimed
grandma
in
great
sorrow
that
blessed
little
creeter
to
think
she
fell
and
got
hurted
she
ai
little
said
peletiah
who
was
extremely
literal
she
awful
long
and
bony
and
he
could
think
of
no
special
reason
for
calling
her
blessed
but
that
might
be
grandma
fancy
well
read
them
letters
said
grandma
mournfully
when
she
could
control
her
speech
enough
to
say
anything
maybe
they
tell
more
about
the
accident
and
she
put
her
hand
again
behind
her
best
ear
in
the
letters
said
peletiah
it
only
just
happened
but
grandma
did
hear
so
he
picked
up
polly
letter
which
was
open
and
began
in
a
singsong
tone
henderson
hey
henderson
cried
peletiah
in
a
shrill
high
key
do
move
up
closer
i
a
little
hard
o
hearin
jist
a
mite
said
grandma
so
peletiah
shoved
his
chair
nearer
and
began
again
henderson
we
are
going
to
have
the
very
loveliest
thing
happen
and
i
want
to
write
to
you
now
because
next
week
there
wo
be
any
time
at
all
we
shall
be
so
very
busy
it
was
impossible
to
stop
peletiah
until
he
had
rounded
a
sentence
as
he
considered
it
his
duty
to
pay
strict
attention
to
a
period
so
although
grandma
screamed
and
even
twitched
his
jacket
sleeve
she
could
get
him
to
stop
the
consequence
was
that
he
had
to
shout
this
over
till
at
last
she
understood
it
and
then
she
turned
a
bewildered
face
upon
him
but
as
he
was
deep
in
his
second
sentence
he
did
see
it
but
plodded
patiently
on
is
going
to
let
us
have
a
garden
party
there
are
tickets
to
be
sold
for

grandma
bascom
and
please
read
this
letter
to
her
from
your
loving
little
friend
polly
peletiah
considering
it
better
to
read
this
all
as
one
sentence
had
droned
it
out
without
a
break
to
look
up
and
find
grandma
sunken
back
against
her
chair
her
cap
frills
trembling
with
indignation
i
hai
heard
a
single
word
she
said
an
there
that
blessed
child
got
hurt
an
i
ca
seem
to
sense
it
at
all
she
ai
hurt
polly
ai
said
peletiah
stoutly
defending
himself
they
going
to
have
a
garden
party
a
what
screamed
grandma
a
party
oh
then
she
fell
in
the
garding
an
you
said
cellar
stairs
she
cried
reproachfully
peletiah
looked
at
her
long
then
he
got
out
of
his
chair
and
leaned
over
her
my
aunt
jerusha
fell
he
screamed
so
loud
that
grandma
started
oh
an
the
pepper
children
ai
hurt
she
cried
in
great
relief
no
they
going
to
have
a
party
he
wisely
left
out
the
garden
this
time
you
do
say
so
exclaimed
grandma
greatly
pleased
at
the
hint
of
any
festivities
no
matter
how
distant
and
the
smiles
began
to
run
all
over
her
wrinkled
face
again
i
wonder
now
she
said
if
they
do
want
my
receet
for
cousin
mirandy
weddin
cake
it
in
th
bible
there
nodding
over
to
the
little
stand
peletiah
seeing
her
so
absorbed
waited
patiently
till
the
second
letter
was
called
for
he
never
for
an
instant
thought
of
sliding
off
so
he
pulled
it
out
of
its
envelope
and
got
ready
at
last
grandma
pulled
herself
out
of
the
charms
of
cousin
receet
and
set
her
spectacles
straight
who
writ
that
one
she
asked
joel
said
peletiah
finding
it
quite
to
his
liking
to
read
this
one
for
joel
never
wasted
any
time
in
preliminaries
but
came
to
the
point
at
once
in
big
sprawly
letters
misses
henderson
somebody
must
have
corrected
him
then
for
he
scratched
out
the
misses
and
wrote
on
top
tell
grandma
bascom
please
that
it
just
prime
here
but
i
like
her
peppermints
too
and
i
wo
chase
her
old
hens
when
i
come
back
joel
when
grandma
really
got
this
letter
by
heart
she
laughed
and
said
it
had
done
her
good
and
she
wished
joel
was
there
this
minute
in
which
peletiah
hardly
concurred
being
unable
to
satisfy
joel
athletic
demands
and
then
she
looked
over
at
the
little
mahogany
stand
and
the
tears
rolled
down
her
withered
old
cheeks
i
give
anythin
to
see
him
comin
in
at
that
door
peletiah
she
said
an
he
may
chase
th
hens
all
he
wants
to
when
he
comes
back
for
grandma
always
cherished
the
conviction
that
the
five
little
peppers
were
to
make
life
merry
again
in
their
little
brown
house
and
she
went
on
so
long
in
this
way
that
peletiah
who
had
glanced
up
at
the
clock
many
times
said
at
last
in
a
stolid
way
there
another
letter
and
grandma
looking
down
saw
a
little
wad
in
his
hand
now
i
do
believe
that
from
the
blessed
little
creeter
she
exclaimed
very
much
excited
that
must
be
phronsie
yes
it
is
said
peletiah
why
did
you
tell
me
that
before
cried
grandma
you
should
read
it
first
of
all
she
leaned
forward
in
her
chair
unable
to
lose
a
word
you
did
tell
me
to
said
peletiah
in
a
way
well
read
it
now
said
grandma
quavering
with
excitement
there
ai
nothin
to
read
said
peletiah
unfolding
the
paper
many
times
creased
hey
there
ai
nothin
to
read
repeated
peletiah
you
can
see
for
yourself
he
held
it
up
before
her
there
were
many
pencil
marks
going
this
way
and
that
by
which
phronsie
felt
perfectly
sure
that
her
friends
would
understand
what
she
was
telling
them
and
once
in
a
while
came
the
great
achievement
of
a
big
capital
letter
laboriously
printed
but
for
these
occasional
slips
into
intelligible
language
the
letter
presented
a
medium
of
communication
peculiar
to
itself
ai
it
sweet
said
grandma
admiringly
when
she
had
looked
it
all
over
the
little
precious
creeter
to
think
of
her
writin
that
and
all
by
herself
too
you
can
read
it
as
well
upside
down
observed
peletiah
i
know
it
grandma
beamed
at
him
just
think
of
that
child
that
who
ever

i
must
go
now
announced
peletiah
getting
out
of
his
chair
and
beginning
to

slowly
well
now

your
ma
i
thank
her
for
comin
and
for
them
letters
from
them
precious
childern
an
see
here
grandma
leaned
over
and
pulled
out
the
under
drawer
of
the
little
stand
it
was
like
giving
peppermints
to
joel
pepper
and
it
sent
a
pang
through
her
at
the
remembrance
but
peletiah
had
been
good
to
read
those
letters
i
to
give
you
these
she
said
beginning
to
shake
therefrom
into
her
hand
three
big
white
peppermints
and
two
red
ones
no
i
thank
you
said
peletiah
stiffly
and
standing
quite
still
yes

said
grandma
decidedly
you
been
real
good
to
read
them
letters
here
peletiah
no
i
thank
you
said
peletiah
again
not
offering
to
stir
well
i
must
be
going
and
he
went
slowly
out
of
the
kitchen
leaving
grandma
with
the
big
peppermints
in
her
hand
that
evening
after
everything
was
quiet
at
the
parsonage
the
minister
called
his
wife
into
the
study
we
will
look
that
letter
over
from
fisher
now
my
dear
henderson
sat
down
on
the
end
of
the
sofa
lie
down
dear
he
said
and
let
me
tuck
a
pillow
under
your
head
you
are
all
tired
out
oh
husband
i
am
sure
you
are
quite
as
tired
as
i
am
and
the
color
flew
into
her
cheeks
like
a
girl
but
he
had
his
way
you
better
leave
the
door
open
as
he
went
across
the
room
to
close
it
jerusha
may
call
jerusha
wo
need
us
he
said
and
shut
it
you
know
the
doctor
said
she
was
not
much
hurt
only
strained
and
bruised
and
she
quite
comfortable
now
well
my
dear
now
about
this
letter
do
you
think
we
might
take
this
child
we
repeated
his
wife
with
wide
eyes
why
husband
i
know
it
seems
a
somewhat
peculiar
thing
to
propose
and
the
parson
smiled
with
our
two
boys
and
jerusha
yes
said
henderson
it
is
and
i
never
thought
seriously
of
it
she
wo
do
peletiah
any
harm
and
then
he
laughed
and
she
might
brighten
him
up
if
she
the
girl
fisher
letter
indicates
and
as
for
ezekiel
there
no
harm
to
be
thought
of
in
that
quarter
our
boys
are
the
ones
wife
to
be
influenced
out
of
their
orbits
well
there
jerusha
henderson
brought
it
out
fearfully
and
then
shut
her
mouth
as
if
she
wished
she
had
said
anything
i
know
dear
you
need
be
afraid
to
speak
it
out
it
is
always
on
my
mind
oh
i
do
wish
and
the
parson
began
to
pace
the
floor
with
troubled
steps
his
wife
threw
back
the
old
with
which
he
had
tucked
her
up
and
bounded
to
his
side
passing
her
hand
within
his
arm
do
dear
she
begged
oh
why
did
i
speak
she
cried
remorsefully
you
said
no
more
than
what
is
always
on
my
mind
said
the
minister
again
and
he
pressed
the
hand
on
his
arm
looking
at
it
fondly
poor
almira
he
said
i
did
think
how
hard
you
would
have
to
work
to
please
her
when
i
took
her
here
but
you
could
help
it
husband
she
cried
looking
up
at
him
with
a
world
of
love
after
your
mother
died
what
place
was
there
for
her
to
go
and
she
really
was
good
to
her
yes
said
the
minister
and
he
sighed
well
it
done
and
she
is
here
but
oh
almira
i
think
it
made
a
great
difference
with
our
boys
henderson
cheek
paled
but
it
would
do
to
let
him
see
her
thoughts
further
on
the
subject
he
was
so
worn
and
tired
so
she
said
well
about
the
little
girl
husband
yes
fisher
letter
must
be
answered
said
the
parson
pulling
himself
out
of
his
revery
she
asks
if
we
can
find
a
place
in
badgertown
for
this
child
who
seems
uncommonly
clever
and
is
so
she
writes
very
truthful
and
i
sure
almira
if
fisher
says
so
the
last
word
has
been
spoken
yes
indeed
said
his
wife
heartily
and
they
found
out
a
great
deal
about
her
she
been
half
starved
and
cruelly
beaten
the
parson
wife
hid
her
tender
eyes
on
her
husband
coat
sleeve
oh
dear
me
she
exclaimed
sympathetically
and
the
old
woman
who
pretended
to
be
her
grandmother
and
who
beat
her
because
she
would
steal
became
frightened
at
the
investigation
and
has
cleared
out
so
there
is
no
one
to
lay
a
claim
to
to
whom
asked
henderson
raising
her
head
suddenly
rag
that
the
only
name
the
child
says
she
has
but
fisher
writes
they
call
her
rachel
now
you
did
notice
that
when
you
read
the
letter
did
you
almira
no
said
his
wife
i
did
have
time
to
read
more
than
part
of
it
do
you
remember
i
hurried
over
to
grandma
bascom
with
the
little
pepper
letters
and
you
said
you
talk
it
over
with
me
when
i
got
home
and
then
peletiah
came
after
me
and
i
ran
back
here
to
poor
jerusha
oh
i
remember
i
should
have
asked
you
he
nodded
remorsefully
well
then
i
tell
you
the
rest
you
read
the
first
part
how
they
ran
across
the
girl
and
all
that
yes
oh
dear
me
it
gives
me
a
shiver
now
to
think
what
an
awful
risk
that
blessed
child
phronsie
ran
cried
henderson
i
know
it
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
it
even
in
the
light
of
her
safety
said
henderson
well
now
king
has
taken
upon
himself
to
support
and
to
educate
rag
rachel
i
mean
and
the
best
place
at
first
at
any
rate
to
put
her
is
badgertown
now
what
do
you
say
almira
to
her
coming
here
to
us
the
parson
wife
hesitated
then
said
jerusha
and
paused
will
she
be
made
unhappy
by
jerusha
you
mean
asked
the
parson
yes
no
i
do
believe
she
will
he
said
decidedly
you
must
remember
she
has
had
her
old
as
she
calls
her
and
after
that
i
think
she
can
bear
jerusha
oh
yes
said
henderson
i
forgot
then
i
say
husband
we
will
take
this
child
i
should
really
love
to
put
the
brightness
into
her
life
and
please
let
her
come
soon
a
pretty
glow
rushed
up
to
her
cheek
and
the
parson
wife
actually
laughed
at
the
prospect
vii
the
disappointment
will
it
stop
grandpapa
phronsie
kneeling
on
a
chair
her
face
pressed
close
to
the
window
pane
turned
to
old
king
looking
over
her
shoulder
i
afraid
not
dear
he
answered
does
god
know
we
want
to
help
the
poor
children
she
asked
suddenly
a
surprised
look
coming
into
her
eyes
yes
yes
dear
of
course
he
knows
child
then
why
does
he
let
it
rain
cried
phronsie
in
a
hurt
voice
oh
because
pet
we
must
have
rain
else
the
flowers
would
grow
you
know
they
all
grown
said
phronsie
trying
to
peer
out
into
the
thick
twilight
between
the
great
splashes
of
rain
running
down
the
window
over
toward
the
garden
and
now
we
ca
have
our
party
grandpapa
she
added
sorrowfully
no
it
would
be
quite
too
wet
after
this
downpour
even
if
it
cleared
said
the
old
gentleman
decidedly
well
phronsie
child
we
must
just
accept
the
matter
philosophically
what
philo
that
big
word
grandpapa
she
asked
turning
away
from
her
effort
to
catch
sight
of
the
off
in
the
distance
gay
with
the
wealth
of
blooms
saved
for
the
festivities
of
the
morrow
and
she
put
her
arm
around
his
neck
oh
that
it
was
a
pretty
large
word
to
use
to
you
and
that
a
fact
said
the
old
gentleman
with
a
little
laugh
he
was
having
rather
a
hard
time
of
it
to
conceal
his
dismay
at
the
blow
to
all
the
plans
and
preparations
so
finely
in
progress
for
the
garden
party
well
it
means
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
all
and
not
fret
oh
said
phronsie
then
she
turned
back
to
her
window
again
and
surveyed
the
driving
storm
perhaps
the
flowers
like
it
she
said
after
a
pause
when
nothing
was
heard
but
the
beating
of
the
rain
against
the
glass
maybe
they
are
thirsty
grandpapa
yes
maybe
assented
grandpapa
absently
and
if
god
wants
it
to
rain
why
we
must
be
glad
must
we
grandpapa
if
he
really
wants
it
yes
yes
child
said
the
old
gentleman
hastily
then
i
glad
said
phronsie
with
a
long
sigh
and
she
clambered
down
from
her
chair
and
let
find
polly
and
tell
her
so
grandpapa
over
in
the
library
there
was
a
dismal
group
joel
was
fighting
valiantly
with
a
flood
of
tears
doubling
up
his
little
fists
and
glaring
at
percy
and
van
at
the
least
intimation
of
a
remark
to
him
little
davie
had
succumbed
long
ago
and
now
crammed
up
in
a
small
heap
in
the
corner
back
of
the
sofa
was
rivaling
the
storm
outside
in
the
flood
of
tears
he
supplied
jasper
crowded
his
hands
in
his
pockets
marching
up
and
down
the
long
room
polly
who
was
swallowing
hard
as
if
her
throat
hurt
her
look
at
one
of
the
boys
little
dick
was
openly
wailing
in
his
arms
oh
shut
up
that
kid
will
you
cried
percy
crossly
over
at
him
percy
percy
said
his
mother
gently
well
he
need
like
a
baby
said
percy
we
all
got
to
give
up
the
garden
party
we
ca
have
any
garden
party
mumbled
little
dick
between
his
sobs
and
crying
all
over
his
mother
pretty
blue
silk
waist
there
there
dear
whitney
said
soothingly
we
have
it
the
next
day
perhaps
dicky
boy
next
day
is
just
forever
whimpered
little
dick
oh
dear
percy
started
an
impatient
exclamation
thought
better
of
it
and
turned
on
his
heel
abruptly
but
van
burst
out
and
the
flowers
all
be
gone
so
what
the
use
of
trying
to
have
it
then
they
wo
cried
joel
in
an
angry
scream
and
squaring
round
at
him
they
sha
so
there
van
whitney
when
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
king
and
phronsie
clinging
to
his
hand
oh
hush
boys
cried
polly
hoarsely
a
wave
of
shame
rising
in
a
rosy
flush
up
to
her
brow
oh
why
had
she
tried
to
keep
cheerful
instead
of
giving
way
to
the
general
gloom
and
now
here
were
phronsie
and
dear
grandpapa
who
had
ordered
just
oceans
of
flowers
and
everything
else
oh
dear
how
naughty
she
had
been
she
sprang
away
from
the
big
carved
table
over
to
take
phronsie
hand
the
flowers
are
thirsty
polly
i
guess
said
phronsie
looking
up
at
her
with
a
smile
and
when
they
drink
all
they
want
to
why
we
have
the
party
wo
we
polly
yes
said
polly
the
flush
not
dying
down
then
that
be
nice
i
think
said
phronsie
smoothing
down
her
gown
in
satisfaction
and
i
can
finish
my
now
for
there
was
one
little
corner
still
untraveled
by
the
remarkable
design
observed
by
the
worker
but
hamilton
dyce
had
protested
he
did
care
for
any
such
trifling
deficiency
for
he
could
put
more
pins
in
that
quarter
so
he
should
still
be
its
purchaser
so
you
can
cried
polly
with
as
much
enthusiasm
as
she
could
muster
and
winking
furiously
over
at
the
boys
and
we
can
write
more
letters
cried
jasper
suddenly
springing
over
to
phronsie
side
phoo
exclaimed
joel
we
got
bushels
already
well
it
nice
to
have
more
yet
retorted
jasper
so
you
better
keep
still
old
fellow
i
shall
write
some
more
announced
van
with
great
pomposity
strutting
up
and
down
the
room
laughed
joel
snapping
his
fingers
in
derision
you
finished
one
yet
and
beside
who
can
read
your
chicken
tracks
i
have
too
declared
van
very
red
in
the
face
ignoring
the
reflection
on
his
writing
and
plunging
over
to
jasper
have
i
jasper
written
a
letter
for
the
post
office
say
have
i
gripping
him
by
the
yes
you
have
said
jasper
he
handed
it
in
this
afternoon
he
added
nodding
to
the
group
there
you
see
van
rushed
triumphantly
up
in
front
of
joel
you
see
joel
pepper
so
you
just
got
to
take
that
back
well
only
one
said
joel
and
there
ca
any
one
read
it
so
that
no
good
and
i
wrote
some
letters
cried
phronsie
running
away
from
the
little
circle
to
thrust
her
face
in
between
the
two
boys
i
did
all
by
myself
one
two
ten
i
guess
little
dick
at
that
stopped
sniveling
and
slipped
off
from
his
lap
i
did
too
write
some
ten
three
just
as
many
as
you
did
the
tears
trailed
off
from
his
red
cheeks
as
he
bobbed
his
head
emphatically
so
no
one
heard
quick
steps
along
the
hall
and
the
door
being
thrown
wide
by
the
butler
saying
they
all
in
the
library
in
came
miss
mary
taylor
and
hamilton
dyce
we
thought
we
drop
in
said
the
gentleman
with
a
quick
glance
at
miss
mary
as
if
to
say
you
see
they
did
need
us
after
all
to
help
cheer
up
why
how
very
jolly
you
all
are
observed
miss
mary
the
were
glistening
on
her
hair
and
cheeks
where
she
had
scampered
away
from
the
protecting
umbrella
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
oh
i
not
wet
fisher
mother
fisher
at
this
moment
coming
in
with
her
mending
basket
i
left
my
mackintosh
in
the
hall
well
well
exclaimed
hamilton
dyce
joel
had
left
sparring
with
van
and
now
swarmed
around
the
newcomer
for
he
was
extremely
fond
of
him
how
are
the
letters
coming
on
jasper
by
the
way
i
a
few
belated
ones
in
the
pockets

my
coat

in
the
hall
i
get
them
let
me
let
me
screamed
joel
all
right
go
ahead
in
both
side
pockets
joe
he
did
consider
it
necessary
to
explain
that
miss
taylor
and
he
had
been
busy
driving
their
pens
all
the
afternoon
whickets
cried
joel
rushing
back
both
hands
overflowing
what
a
lot
joel
what
did
you
say
mother
fisher
glanced
up
the
lines
of
worry
that
had
settled
over
her
face
at
the
terrible
disappointment
that
had
befallen
the
family
disappearing
now
that
the
usual
cheeriness
was
coming
back
i
did
mean
to
said
joel
the
color
all
over
his
chubby
face
but
my

den
you

thank
miss
mary
said
dyce
but
miss
mary
laughingly
protesting
the
gratitude
was
not
so
much
due
to
her
the
whole
company
filed
out
after
jasper
in
great
good
spirits
little
davie
back
of
the
sofa
poked
up
his
head
are
they
all
gone
mamsie
he
asked
fearfully

mother

startled

needle

a
i
thought

said
david
working
his
way
out
to
run
and
lay
his
swollen
little
face
in
his
mother
lap
she
cleared
away
her
work
and
took
him
up
to
gather
him
close
in
her
arms
there
there
davie
mother
boy
it
all
right
smoothing
the
hair
away
from

hot
brow

perhaps
there
be
all
the
more
pleasure
and
good
time
tis
that
said
little
davie
wriggling
around
to
look
up
at
her
but
polly
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
the
floods
were
to
descend
again
oh
polly
is
all
right
said
fisher
cheerfully
is
she
mamsie
asked
david
doubtfully
yes
indeed
and
you
must
see
that
you
keep
yourself
right
that
all
any
of
us
can
do
said
mother
fisher
now
davie
my
boy
hop
down
and
run
into
jasper
den
with
the
others
oh
i
ca
mamsie
protested
davie
in
horror
and
burrowing
in
her
arms
they

i
been
crying
that
the
trouble
with
crying
observed
mother
fisher
wisely
it
makes
you
twice
sorry
once
when

it
and
the
next
time
when
it
shows
you
ca
help
it
now
davie
so
run
along
mother
wants
you
to
if
mother
wanted
them
to
that
was
always
enough
for
each
of
the
five
little
peppers
so
davie
slid
slowly
down
from
her
lap
and
went
out
and
down
the
hall
meantime
miss
mary
had
taken
polly
arm
in
the
procession
to
jasper
den
oh
polly
how
cheery
you
have
made
them
she
exclaimed
we
expected
to
see
you
all
perhaps
drowned
in
tears
oh
i
have
done
it
anything
to
make
them
happy
cried
polly
the
wave
of
color
again
flooding
her
cheeks
indeed
i
have
miss
mary
i
been
bad
and
wicked
and
horrid
she
said
penitently
her
head
drooping
oh

protested
miss
mary
her
arm
around
polly
waist
yes
i
have
miss
mary
i
well
do
let
us
talk
now
about
it
we
will
look
at
the
letters
miss
mary
drew
her
within
the
den
there
stood
jasper
behind
the
table
perfectly
overflowing
with
epistles
of
every
sort
and
size
while
little
packages
and
some
not
so
very
little
either
filled
up
all
the
receptacles
possible
for
mail
matter
oh
my
what
a
lot
exclaimed
everybody
as
joel
with
a
dash
precipitated
his
handfuls
on
the
already
pile
this
is
only
the
beginning
laughed
jasper
waving
his
arms
over
to
compass
the
whole
den
just
look
on
the
top
of
the
bookcase
will
you
everybody
whirled
around
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
grandpapa
at
the
sight
letters
were
scattered
here
and
there
in
the
thickest
of
piles
all
along
the
surface
while
the
chinese
vase
had
a
whole
handful
poking
up
their
faces
as
if
to
say
here
we
are
all
the
way
from
china
dear
me
exclaimed
old
king
again
when
do
you
ever
expect
to
sell
all
those
jasper
mine
is
in
there
announced
phronsie
hanging
to
his
hand
and
pointing
to
the
vase
grandpapa
it
really
is
japser
put
it
there
did
he
pet
cried
the
old
gentleman
immensely
interested
yes
he
did
truly
said
phronsie
bobbing
her
head
emphatically
i
saw
him
my
own
self
grandpapa
it
to
she
stood
on
her
tiptoes
and
whispered
the
last
bit
of
information
no
is
it
cried
grandpapa
highly
gratified
and
lifting
her
up
to
a
level
with
his
face
he
kissed
her
on
both
cheeks
now
phronsie
i
shall
always
keep
that
letter
he
said
as
he
set
her
down
shall
you
cried
phronsie
smoothing
her
gown
with
great
satisfaction
then
i
so
glad
i
wrote
it
grandpapa
over
by
the
table
jasper
was
saying
to
polly
now
what
shall
we
do
with
this
dreadfully
long
evening
do
hurry
and
think
polly
before
everybody
gets
dismal
again
oh
i
do
know
said
polly
at
her
wit
end
but
we
must
think
of
something
said
jasper
desperately
and
fumbling
the
letters
polly
eye
fell
on
his
restless
fingers
we
might
sort
them
out
the
letters
and
tie
them
up
in
little
packages
to
take
out
to
the
post
office
the
very
thing
cried
jasper
enthusiastically
here
all
you
good
people
he
whirled
around
if
you
want
to
help
please
sit
down
and
we
get
this
mess
of
letters
sorted
and
tied
up
into
bundles
he
waved
his
hands
over
his
head
and
of
course
everybody
stopped
talking
at
once
oh
whickets
joel
screamed
then
he
caught
polly
eye
and
his
chubby
face
took
on
a
lively
red
let
me
let
me
he
crammed
himself
in
between
jasper
and
the
table
hold
on
commanded
jasper
not
so
fast
joe
and
he
seized
joel
brown
hands
just
grabbing
a
big
pile
wait
till
jasper
tells
us
how
to
begin
said
polly
her
brown
eyes
dancing
at
the
prospect
of
something
to
do
oh
dear
whimpered
joel
stamping
in
his
impatience
the
whitney
boys
were
crowding
up
close
behind
do
hurry
up
jasper
they
teased
well
how
shall
we
begin
polly
jasper
wrinkled
up
his
brows
in
perplexity
let
ask
miss
mary
said
polly
so
jasper
called
miss
mary
but
she
did
seem
to
hear
which
perhaps
was
so
very
strange
after
all
as
dyce
was
telling
her
something
which
must
have
been
very
interesting
over
in
the
corner
when
at
last
the
summons
reached
her
she
came
hurrying
over
with
very
pink
cheeks
oh
what
can
i
do
to
help
we
been
calling
and
calling
for
ever
so
long
said
joel
in
a
very
injured
tone
for
he
had
added
his
voice
when
he
saw
that
things
were
waiting
for
miss
taylor
oh
have
you
joel
that
too
bad
miss
mary
cheeks
became
pinker
than
ever
well
you
are
always
screaming
over
something
joe
you
beggar
dyce
pulled
his
ear
so
it
no
wonder
that
your
cries
are
not
attended
to
on
the
instant
when
miss
mary
saw
what
was
wanted
of
her
she
proposed
that
jasper
give
out
twelve
letters
to
each
person
who
should
tie
them
up
neatly
and
put
in
a
big
basket
then
they
would
be
ready
to
take
out
to
the
post
office
in
the
wistaria
arbor
and
to
be
sorted
into
the
little
boxes
which
grandpapa
had
commissioned
the
carpenter
to
make
all
up
and
down
the
sides
leaving
one
end
free
for
the
delivery
window
the
door
for
the
postmaster
and
his
assistants
was
to
be
at
the
opposite
corner
oh
yes
how
nice
exclaimed
polly
hopping
up
and
down
as
ecstatically
as
phronsie
ever
did
jasper
i
get
a
ball
of
twine
and
she
was
flying
off
no
you
stay
here
and
help
me
give
out
the
letters
said
jasper
oh
i
want
to
do
that
cried
joel
squeezing
and
crowding
no
you
must
get
the
big
basket
said
jasper
go
and
ask
thomas
to
give
you
one
i
do
want
to
get
an
old
basket
whined
joel
let
percy
get
it
hoh
i
not
going
to
declared
percy
drawing
himself
up
in
great
state
then
i
will
go
myself
said
jasper
flinging
down
a
handful
of
letters
to
hurry
off
joel
said
polly
in
a
sorry
little
voice
and
turning
away
from
the
table
now
you
will
spoil
everything
and
we
just
got
to
feeling
good
how
can
you
joey
i
did
mean
began
joel
turning
his
back
on
her
while
he
winked
very
hard
i
did
mean
to
polly
percy
dug
the
toe
of
his
shoe
into
the
rug
and
looked
down
on
the
floor
then
run
after
jasper
cried
polly
hurry
and
tell
him
so
i
will
cried
joel
plunging
off
and
percy
being
left
alone
as
van
had
slid
away
to
another
group
when
he
saw
how
things
were
going
on
concluded
to
follow
and
presently
jasper
came
back
it
all
right
polly
he
nodded
brightly
to
her
and
they
fell
to
work
and
in
a
minute
or
two
joel
came
back
with
percy
carrying
the
basket
a
big
market
affair
between
them
and
when
he
saw
what
fun
they
were
having
over
it
for
they
were
both
laughing
merrily
van
wished
he
had
gone
and
seeing
his
dismal
face
jasper
sent
him
after
a
ball
of
twine
and
then
phronsie
wanted
to
get
something
and
little
dick
teased
to
go
too
so
grandpapa
suggested
they
should
go
after
some
extra
pairs
of
scissors
and
mamsie
will
let
us
take
hers
out
of
her
workbasket
i
guess
cried
phronsie
let
us
ask
her
grandpapa
dear
oh
you
better
stop
working
mrs
fisher
old
king
popped
his
white
head
in
at
the
library
door
there
sat
mother
fisher
by
the
table
mending
away
as
usual
for
the
stockings
never
seemed
to
be
quite
done
and
come
into
jasper
den
and
see
how
fine
we
all
are
he
added
gayly
yes
mamsie
do
come
chirped
phronsie
running
her
head
in
between
him
and
the
to
plead
yes
mamsie
do
come
echoed
little
dick
who
would
do
and
say
everything
that
phronsie
did
you
see
you
simply
got
to
come
laughed
grandpapa
and
may
we
have
your
scissors
mamsie
phronsie
now
deserted
old
king
to
run
over
to
the
big
workbasket
my
scissors
repeated
mother
fisher
why
phronsie
child
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
we
going
to
cut
letters
said
phronsie
with
an
important
air
her
fingers
already
in
the
basket
which
standing
on
tiptoe
she
had
pulled
quickly
over
toward
her
in
her
eagerness
and
may
we
have
your
scissors
mamsie
take
care
warned
mother
fisher
but
too
late
over
went
the
big
basket
and
away
rattled
all
the
things
having
a
perfectly
beautiful
time
by
themselves
over
the
library
floor
bless
me
ejaculated
old
king
while
little
dick
laughed
right
out
phronsie
stood
quite
still
the
color
all
out
of
her
round
cheeks
then
her
bosom
heaved
and
she
darted
over
to
lay
her
head
in
mother
fisher
lap
oh
i
did
mean
to
mamsie
she
wailed
oh
deary
me
bless
me
exclaimed
grandpapa
in
the
greatest
consternation
and
leaning
over
the
two
there
there
do
mind
it
deary
mother
fisher
was
smoothing
the
yellow
hair
take
me
mamsie
begged
phronsie
holding
up
both
hands
and
she
burrowed
her
face
deeper
yet
in
fisher
lap
oh
dear
me
old
king
kept
exclaiming
then
he
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
and
mopped
his
face
violently
this
not
making
him
feel
any
better
he
kept
exclaiming
oh
dear
me
at
intervals
i
pick
up
said
little
dick
cheerfully
beginning
to
race
after
the
spools
and
things
over
the
floor
mother
fisher
had
drawn
phronsie
up
to
her
bosom
where
she
cuddled
her
to
her
heart
content
now
child
she
said
after
a
minute
i
think
you
ought
to
help
to
pick
up
the
things
and
put
them
in
the
basket
see
how
nicely
dicky
is
doing
it
i
getting
all
the
spools
announced
dick
jamming
all
the
chairs
aside
that
he
could
move
and
lifting
a
very
hot
face
yes
come
phronsie
i
think
you
ought
to
help
him
phronsie
so
phronsie
slipped
out
of
her
mother
lap
obediently
and
wiped
off
her
tears
come
on
said
little
dick
in
great
glee
i
going
under
the
table
there
a
lot
under
there
and
in
shorter
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
the
spools
and
mending
cotton
and
tape
measure
and
dear
me
the
things
of
which
fisher
big
workbasket
was
always
full
were
all
collected
from
the
nice
time
they
were
having
on
the
floor
and
snugly
set
up
in
their
places
again
and
mother
fisher
escorted
by
the
children
and
old
king
who
by
this
time
was
laughing
quite
gayly
once
more
was
going
out
into
the
hall
on
the
way
to
jasper
den
and
phronsie
had
the
big
shears
and
little
dick
the
smaller
little
scissors
hullo
king
called
out
as
the
butler
ushered
into
the
hall
two
gentlemen
in
dripping
mackintoshes
now
that
fine
cabot
and
alstyne
to
drop
in
of
this
dismal
evening
we
called
to
condole
with
you
all
said
both
gentlemen
as
they
were
divested
of
their
wet
garments
but
it
does
seem
as
if
our
services
were
needed
with
a
glance
at
grandpapa
and
his
group
oh
my
family
gets
over
any
little
disappointment
such
as
bad
weather
observed
the
old
gentleman
with
pride
well
come
this
way
the
principal
object
of
interest
is
in
jasper
den
no
need
to
announce
it
as
the
peals
of
laughter
and
chatter
sounded
down
the
long
hall
viii
the
garden
party
and
so
after
all
it
turned
out
to
be
the
very
best
thing
that
the
garden
party
did
not
take
place
until
two
days
after
for
all
was
then
as
sweet
and
fresh
as
a
rose
all
but
one
thing
and
that
was
on
the
very
morning
of
the
eventful
day
chatterton
drove
up
but
then
as
jasper
observed
to
polly
when
this
dire
news
was
announced
cousin
eunice
was
always
turning
up
when
least
wanted
and
polly
had
as
usual
to
keep
back
her
own
thoughts
on
the
subject
to
comfort
him
it
would
never
do
to
add
to
his
dismay
why
she
ca
stay
in
europe
when
she
everlastingly
saying
that
there
is
no
place
in
america
to
compare
with
it
i
do
for
my
part
see
he
cried
in
a
pet
i
suppose
she
wants
to
be
with
her
relations
jasper
said
polly
with
a
sigh
relations
jasper
turned
suddenly
on
his
heel
and
thrust
his
hands
deeply
in
his
pockets
well
she
fights
with
every
single
one
of
them
he
said
savagely
oh
jasper
fights
exclaimed
polly
in
horror
whose
great
grief
had
always
been
at
having
no
relations
so
to
speak
dear
me
how
very
dreadful
well
you
know
she
does
said
jasper
gloomily
and
squaring
round
always
picking
and
carping
at
something
or
somebody
and
now
father
will
be
all
upset
by
her
if
she
had
only
waited
till
polly
felt
such
a
dreadful
sinking
of
her
heart
just
then
that
for
a
minute
she
did
speak
there
did
seem
to
be
any
comfort
for
this
and
just
think
how
good
father
has
been
went
on
jasper
too
miserable
to
keep
still
and
all
those
flowers
he
had
ordered
for
of
course
he
could
let
the
florists
suffer
and
that
he
sent
to
the
hospitals
when
it
poured
so
i
know
it
said
polly
swallowing
hard
and
now
he
has
ordered
another
lot
and
everything
else
why
you
know
polly
there
is
anything
father
has
done
to
make
this
fair
a
success
and
now
she
has
come
jasper
flung
himself
into
a
chair
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
oh
jasper
cried
polly
running
over
to
him
in
the
greatest
distress
do
oh
dear
me
what
can
we
do
nothing
said
jasper
in
the
depths
of
gloom
nothing
will
do
any
good
so
long
as
she
has
come
oh
there
must
something
be
done
declared
polly
quite
wildly
and
feeling
equal
to
anything
if
she
only
knew
what
would
avail
here
comes
grandpapa
oh
he
must
see
us
feeling
badly
jasper
sprang
from
his
chair
come
polly
and
they
flew
out
into
the
side
hall
now
where
are
those
two
polly
and
jasper
said
old
king
to
himself
coming
to
the
library
in
a
great
state
of
irritation
i
searched
this
house
for
them
and
nobody
seems
to
have
the
least
idea
where
they
have
gone
polly
jasper
he
cried
loudly
and
it
was
a
very
pleasant
voice
either
oh
dear
jasper
seized
polly
hands
in
a
corner
of
the
hall
calling
us
and
we
got
to
go
polly
and
how
we
look
you
and
i
whatever
shall
we
do
but
we
must
go
breathed
polly
then
she
looked
up
into
jasper
face
let
ask
him
to
go
out
and
help
us
fix
the
flowers
she
cried
suddenly
jasper
gave
her
a
keen
glance
all
right
he
said
come
on
and
before
their
resolution
had
time
to
cool
itself
they
rushed
into
the
library
oh
grandpapa
they
both
cried
together
do
come
out
and
tell
us
how
to
fix
the
flowers
hey
the
old
gentleman
whirled
around
from
the
table
where
he
had
begun
to
throw
the
papers
about
did
you
know
chatterton
had
come
back
he
glared
at
them
over
his
spectacles
which
he
had
forgotten
to
remove
when
he
had
been
interrupted
with
the
unwelcome
news
while
peacefully
reading
the
morning
paper
yes
oh
yes
said
jasper
oh
yes
we
know
it
cried
polly
cheerfully
but
grandpapa
we
want
you
tugging
at
his
hand
hey
you
knew
it
the
old
gentleman
tone
softened
and
he
suffered
himself
to
be
led
toward
the
door
and
you
want
me
eh
feeling
with
every
step
as
if
life
after
all
might
be
worth
living
yes
we
do
indeed
father
cried
jasper
affectionately
possessing
himself
of
the
other
hand
and
oh
the
flowers
you
sent
are
just
too
lovely
for
anything
cried
polly
dancing
away
along
by
his
side
they
gorgeous
grandpapa
dear
are
they
so
grandpapa
beamed
at
her
all
his
happiness
returned
so
you
want
me
to
tell
you
how
to
arrange
them
eh
and
his
satisfaction
in
being
appealed
to
was
so
intense
that
he
held
his
head
high
well
come
on
and
he
laughed
gayly
chatterton
newly
arrived
in
the
handsome
suite
of
apartments
cousin
horatio
hospitality
always
allowed
her
looked
out
of
the
window
and
having
no
one
else
to
confide
her
opinions
to
was
not
averse
to
chatting
with
her
french
maid
is
it
perfectly
absurd
hortense
to
see
that
old
man
and
to
think
how
particular
and
aristocratic
he
used
to
be
why
i
can
remember
when
he
would
hardly
let
jasper
speak
to
him
in
some
of
his
moods
and
now
just
see
that
beggar
girl
actually
holding
his
hand
and
he
laughing
with
her
a
beggaire
is
it
cried
hortense
dropping
the
gown
she
was
brushing
to
run
to
the
window
i
see
no
beggaire
madame
craning
her
neck
you
need
drop
your
work
said
chatterton
with
asperity
just
because
i
made
a
simple
remark
you
know
quite
well
whom
i
mean
hortense
it
that
polly
pepper
i
speaking
of
she
is
not
a
beggaire
madame
declared
hortense
pertly
opening
her
black
eyes
very
wide
oh
she
extended
her
hands
and
burst
into
a
series
of
shrill
cackles
why
she
like
all
de
oder
children
in
dis
house
and
i
think
truly
madame
de
best
go
back
to
your
work
i
say
commanded
chatterton
in
a
fury
forgetting
herself
enough
to
stamp
her
foot
so
hortense
picked
up
the
gown
but
she
continued
to
cackle
softly
to
herself
with
now
and
then
a
furtive
glance
at
her
mistress
outside
with
all
the
sunny
influence
of
the
summer
morning
upon
him
old
king
and
polly
and
jasper
went
about
superintending
the
placing
of
the
flowers
for
there
seemed
to
be
a
great
many
in
the
pots
with
ferns
and
palms
to
distribute
where
they
would
best
show
off
and
be
persuaded
to
swell
the
poor
children
fund
oh
grandpapa
dear
what
richness
sighed
polly
clasping
her
hands
in
ecstasy
i
do
think
i
never
saw
so
many
and
such
beauties
only
look
jasper
at
that
azalea
i
know
it
said
jasper
his
eyes
sparkling
and
those
orchids
polly
oh
i
know
i
know
said
polly
spinning
about
to
take
it
all
in
old
king
put
back
his
head
and
laughed
to
see
her
i
so
glad
you
like
it
polly
my
girl
he
said
heartily
pleased
like
it
grandpapa
repeated
polly
standing
quite
still
oh
it
just
too
beautiful
and
she
clasped
her
hands
tightly
together
well
i
think
we
best
get
to
work
said
jasper
bursting
into
a
laugh
come
on
polly
let
set
about
it
i
think
so
too
said
polly
coming
out
of
her
rapture
thereupon
ensued
such
a
busy
time
especially
as
old
turner
and
two
of
his
came
up
for
directions
and
king
went
off
with
them
so
for
the
next
hour
polly
seemed
to
be
on
wings
here
there
and
everywhere
and
breathing
only
the
sweet
fragrance
of
the
flowers
how
phronsie
would
enjoy
it
the
fixing
and
all
she
mourned
in
the
midst
of
it
as
the
transforming
of
the
into
veritable
bowers
of
beauty
went
on
but
you
know
she
had
to
take
a
long
nap
else
she
would
be
all
tired
out
and
the
afternoon
is
going
to
be
a
long
one
polly
oh
i
know
said
polly
flying
on
with
her
work
faster
than
ever
and
mamsie
was
right
to
make
her
go
to
sleep
fisher
is
always
right
said
jasper
decidedly
ever
and
always
is
she
cried
polly
in
a
glow
well
jasper
do
you
think
that
smilax
ought
to
be
trained
up
there
she
twisted
her
head
to
view
the
effect
and
looked
up
at
him
anxiously
yes
no
said
jasper
critically
i
do
believe
i
put
it
there
it
looks
too
much
polly
there
are
so
many
vines
about
so
it
does
said
polly
in
great
relief
when
one
is
working
over
any
thing
it
looks
so
different
does
it
i
should
say
so
cried
jasper
oh
polly
it
ca
ever
in
all
this
world
be
twelve
it
ca
exclaimed
polly
in
dismay
but
there
was
one
of
the
maids
coming
across
the
lawn
with
the
summons
to
go
in
to
luncheon
which
was
to
be
served
at
an
earlier
hour
than
usual
and
after
that
no
one
had
more
than
a
moment
in
which
to
think
for
at
three
the
garden
party
was
to
open
and
the
fair
to
be
in
full
progress
long
before
that
time
the
avenues
and
streets
leading
out
to
the
horatio
king
estate
were
thronged
with
children
of
all
ages
and
sizes
most
of
them
with
their
all
bound
to
the
scene
of
the
garden
party
their
small
purses
dangling
by
chains
from
their
arms
or
carried
carefully
in
their
hands
for
was
this
to
help
poor
children
who
did
have
any
pleasant
homes
but
lived
in
stuffy
tenement
houses
to
go
out
into
the
broad
beautiful
country
where
they
could
race
in
the
fields
and
play
with
the
chickens
and
pick
all
the
flowers
they
wanted
to
and
so
ever
since
the
announcement
had
been
made
that
such
a
fund
was
to
be
raised
there
had
been
much
hoarding
of
pennies
and
no
slight
on
the
part
of
the
younger
element
who
would
naturally
be
drawn
into
the
plan
all
the
society
people
were
to
drive
up
later
and
until
the
early
evening
hours
it
was
to
be
the
function
of
the
town
which
every
one
was
anxious
to
attend
but
everybody
in
king
household
was
to
be
ready
to
receive
exactly
at
three
phronsie
was
in
the
highest
of
spirits
having
grandpapa
hand
to
cling
to
trying
to
welcome
all
the
guests
and
keeping
one
eye
out
to
see
that
rachel
was
enjoying
herself
attired
in
a
pretty
pink
cambric
gown
her
black
hair
which
now
seemed
oh
so
soft
and
pretty
tied
back
with
little
pink
bows
and
rachel
eyes
well
there
no
one
would
ever
have
suspected
that
they
had
only
been
accustomed
to
the
squalor
of
apartment
and
gran
herself
but
one
short
week
ago
they
now
looked
on
the
world
in
general
and
this
fair
scene
in
particular
with
all
the
nonchalance
of
one
born
and
brought
up
in
the
midst
of
such
conditions
as
could
bring
about
a
state
of
affairs
like
the
present
that
surrounded
her
and
many
asked
who
is
that
child
for
it
was
clearly
seen
that
she
was
of
the
set
that
was
thronging
the
grounds
rachel
herself
was
wholly
unconscious
of
the
remarks
that
were
being
made
so
she
devoted
her
heart
and
soul
to
the
duty
assigned
to
her
that
of
waiting
on
polly
and
her
bevy
of
school
friends
in
one
of
the
and
she
never
bothered
about
any
curious
glances
or
asides
until
a
chance
remark
struck
her
ear
as
she
was
hurrying
across
the
lawn
which
she
thought
needed
attention
then
she
raised
her
head
and
her
black
eyes
grew
sharp
and
intent
it
was
chatterton
who
was
speaking
yes
it
a
little
beggar
girl
he
took
in
and
the
cackle
was
unpleasant
that
accompanied
the
words
dear
me
i
expect
she
rob
us
all
such
creatures
are
so
sly
she
was
pointing
out
rachel
to
one
of
her
friends
lately
arrived
from
europe
and
who
had
exerted
herself
to
come
early
and
see
the
children
do
you
mean
me
demanded
rachel
her
black
eyes
like
gimlets
on
the
long
cynical
face
if
you
does
i
can
tell
you
that
what
i
does
i
does
right
out
on
top
an
i
guess
by
the
looks
o
you
that
ai
your
style
you
impertinent
creature
exclaimed
chatterton
her
long
face
crimson
with
passion
not
allayed
by
seeing
that
her
friend
could
with
difficulty
control
her
amusement
she
tell
this
everywhere
she
fumed
within
i
shall
go
and
speak
to
my
cousin
king
about
you
girl
she
moved
her
arm
and
shapely
hand
both
very
beautiful
still
and
well
exhibited
on
every
occasion
and
started
off
with
great
dignity
i
would
said
rachel
scornfully
then
she
laughed
oh
me
oh
my
you
such
a
you
are
and
she
doubled
up
her
thin
figure
and
went
off
in
a
little
gust
of
merriment
come
with
me
chatterton
darted
back
and
seized
her
friend
arm
to
drag
her
away
that
detestable
creature
makes
me
feel
quite
faint
as
soon
as
they
had
disappeared
down
a
winding
path
rachel
amusement
quite
left
her
she
drew
herself
up
stiffly
and
hurried
back
to
polly
to
be
the
same
quiet
attentive
deft
little
maiden
as
before
you
do
tie
flowers
up
so
beautifully
cried
polly
handing
her
another
big
spool
of
baby
ribbon
does
she
girls
yes
indeed
cried
ever
so
many
i
ca
tie
a
bow
to
save

declared
alexia
it
all
snarls
up
and
it
looks
for
all
the
world
when
i
get
through
as
if
my
dog
had
chewed
it
oh
dear
me
yes

basket

two
dollars

the
little
tot
who
had
to
stand
on
tiptoes
to
peer
over
the
table
with
its
blooming
beauty
i
want
it
for
my
mamma
and
he
gave
his
smart
little
cane
to
the
nursemaid
to
hold
while
he
opened
his
purse
well
it
a
beauty
rick
said
alexia
picking
up
the
basket
the
violets
are
so
sweet
and
she
sniffed
them
two
or
three
times
as
she
passed
them
over
here
rick
halliday
called
clem
at
the
other
end
of
the
table

loud
enough
for
polly
to
hear
and
she
dropped
the
box
of
ribbon
under
the
table
no
no
she
said
decidedly
hurrying
over
grandpapa
said
we
were
not
to

declared
small
rick
over
to
her
taking
his
little
cane

nursemaid
hand
anyway
and
beside
my
papa
said
if
any
one
teased
me
to
spend
my
money
i
was
to
come
right
away
but
he
did
believe
they
would
here
and
with
his
basket
of
flowers
for
his
mother
he
moved
off
with
great
dignity
across
the
lawn
swinging
his
cane
as
he
had
noticed
the
men
did
of
all
kids
i
do
think
that
rick
halliday
is
the
most
detestable
infant
exclaimed
clem
in
great
discomfort
oh
yes
nunn
her
face
brightening
we
have
heliotrope
ever
so
much
of
it
she
thrust
her
hands
into
a
big
vase
overflowing
with
fragrance
how
many
oh
three
dozen
sprays
yes
indeed
illustration
but
this
is
ten
dollars
said
joel
and
the
bands
one
at
the
end
of
the
big
lawn
and
the
other
on
the
terrace
at
the
farther
side
of
the
house
were
playing
their
sweetest
and
now
the
society
folk
began
to
put
in
an
appearance
among
the
throngs
of
children
everybody
was
in
gala
attire
and
the
garden
party
was
at
its
height
joel
cried
cabot
to
that
individual
rushing
in
and
out
among
the
little
knots
of
gayly
dressed
visitors
here
run
over
to
the
post
office
will
you
and
see
if
there
are
any
letters
for
me
all
right
joel
cried
as
he
flew
along
and
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
back
he
rushed
with
three
missives
how
much
ten
cents
apiece
said
joel
promptly
i
get
change
in
a
minute
and
he
was
flying
off
again
with
the
bill
thrust
into
his
hand
i
do
take
any
change
here
i
do
want
any
i
wo
be
bothered
with
it
declared
cabot
in
his
most
decided
fashion
but
this
is
ten
dollars
said
joel
aghast
and
stopping
short
to
flap
the
bill
never
mind
that
my
affair
go
along
or
i
report
you
are
you
one
of
the
postmen
pointing
sternly
to
his
badge
yes
said
joel
straightening
up
and
puffing
out
his
chubby
cheeks
with
pride
well
then
you
find
yourself
reported
if
you
do
march
cried
cabot
so
off
with
yourself
to
the
postmaster
come
on
joel
called
another
of
the
postmen
who
happened
to
be
percy
rushing
along
i
going
to
get
my
mail
bag
now
there
just
a
crowd
of
folks
waiting
over
there
for
letters
pointing
over
to
the
pine
grove
so
will
i
get
mine
shouted
joel
and
see
here
waving
his
bill
what
cabot
sent
to
jasper
i
guess
that
send
one
poor
child
off
into
the
country
percy
whitney
wo
that
be
prime
there
was
such
a
crowd
around
the
post
office
that
percy
and
joel
who
much
preferred
being
to
helping
jasper
within
had
to
crawl
in
under
the
vines
to
find
the
mail
bags
here
jasper
cried
joel
take
it
do
throwing
the
bill
down
in
a
flurry
to
fling
the
strap
of
his
mail
bag
over
his
head
before
percy
should
get
his
in
order
but
jasper
who
was
trying
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
a
throng
of
people
all
clamoring
at
the
small
window
for
letters
did
see
it
or
even
hear
his
name
called
so
the
bill
lay
perfectly
still
where
it
fell
until
it
got
all
tired
out
and
a
little
puff
of
wind
sweeping
through
the
arbor
blew
it
first
to
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
until
at
last
it
fell
down
among
a
tangle
of
evergreen
with
which
the
posts
of
the
arbor
were
wound
and
presently
van
who
much
preferred
being
assistant
to
jasper
to
running
about
as
a
letter
carrier
came
along
and
exclaimed
oh
that
silly
old
green
stuff
it
takes
up
so
much
room
and
he
twitched
off
a
lot
of
it
and
the
bill
well
crumpled
up
inside
of
the
bunch
sighed
and
said
to
itself
as
it
was
flung
under
the
counter
now
i
guess
i
dead
and
buried
forever
meanwhile
joel
as
happy
as
a
lark
at
the
thought
of
contribution
went
off
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
distributing
letters
here
there
and
everywhere
and
receiving
lots
of
orders
it
was
oh
joel
get
me
a
letter
and
joel
get
me
one
i
ca
get
near
the
post
office
there
a
perfect
mob
there
and
joel
pepper
from
clear
across
the
lawn
come
over
here
singleton
wants
to
see
you
about
some
letters
until
joel
began
to
feel
that
he
was
about
running
the
whole
department
and
it
seemed
as
if
every
drop
of
blood
was
in
his
chubby
face
he
was
so
hot
but
he
never
thought
of
being
tired
he
was
so
happy
plunging
on
oh
my
gracious
honey
you
done
mos
knocked
de
bref
out
o
me
it
was
candace
who
had
left
her
little
shop
on
temple
place
to
help
forward
the
garden
party
against
whom
he
had
come
up
careless
where
he
was
going
ix
the
bill
oh
i
so
sorry
joel
brought
himself
up
remorsefully
trying
to
recover
the
collection
of
rag
dolls
sent
spinning
from
her
black
arms
an
dey
were

candace

tumultuously
oh

he
flung
himself
down
on
the
grass
by
her
side
distress
was
written
so
plainly
all
over
his
hot
face
that
candace
stopped
in
her
work
over
the
dolls
to
turn
and
regard

she
cried

she
added
emphatically

to
his
feet
and
ran
all
around
the
big
figure
to
get
the
most
comprehensive
view
it
all
right
candace
he
reported
in
great
satisfaction

brown

candace
laying

he
tugged
very
red
in
the
face
till
finally
she
set
her
ample
gaiters
on
the
ground
and

delighted

and
quite
important
to

sent
with
a
message
to
such
an
effect
you

slow
cried
joel
answering
both
statements
at
once
and
whirling
around
in
an
endeavor
to
keep
the
bag
at
his
back
but
van
flew
for
it
disdaining
to
waste
more
time
over
arguments
candace
stretched
out
a
large
black
hand
see
here
now
van
leggo
dat
bag
she
seized
him
by
the
jacket
collar
with
such
a
grip
that
he
dismissed
all
thoughts
of
the
mail
bag
his
one
concern
now
being
to
get
free
from
candace
ow
he
screamed
wriggling
violently
i

mail

candace

cried
little
dick
half
across
the
lawn
to
a
merry
party
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
turned
to
follow
the
pointing
of
the
small
finger
toward
candace
and
her
capture
oh
let
me
go
cried
van
very
red
in
the
face
at

and
trying
to
duck
behind
her
big
figure
candace
let

begged
joel
just
as
much
distressed
he
wo

said
candace
slowly
releasing
van
jacket
collar
an
none
his
fault
dat
he
stopped
kerryin
de
letters
but
van
was
off
from
under
her
open
fingers
and
shot
across
the
green
in
the
opposite
direction
from
little
dick
and
his
party
now
i
take
my
dolls
to
de
ladies
observed
candace
bundling
them
up
in
her
clean
checked
apron
she
sent
a
satisfied
glance
after
joel
making
quick
time
toward
the
post
office
then
waddled
off
boy
called
a
fine
imperious
voice
as
joel
dashed
by
a
group
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
as
there
was
any
other
boy
in
sight
he
might
be
supposed
to
be
the
one
wanted
but
joel
by
this
time
was
frantic
to
get
to
the
post
office
and
with
his
mind
filled
with
mortification
and
distress
at
his
delay
from
his
duty
he
paid
no
heed
to
the
call
now
repeated
more
insistently
it
a
lady
then
said
joel
to
himself
so
i
must
go
back
oh
dear
me
he
wheeled
abruptly
and
hot
and
plunged
up
to
the
group
what
is
it
then
he
saw
to
his
disgust
that
it
was
chatterton
she
was
surrounded
by
friends
whom
she
had
met
abroad
why
did
you
come
when
i
bade
you
she
exclaimed
arrogantly
do
you
know
it
your
place
to
serve
me
no
said
joel
bluntly
his
black
eyes
fixed
on
her
face
one
or
two
of
the
gentlemen
turned
aside
with
a
laugh
what
you
little
beggar
chatterton
said
it
between
her
teeth
furious
at
the
amusement
of
her
friends
but
joel
heard
i
not
a
beggar
he
declared
hotly
and
squaring
his
shoulders
by
this
time
he
forgot
all
about
the
mail
bag
and
you
have
any
right
to
say
so
with
flashing
eyes
chatterton
now
seeing
him
worked
up
recovered
herself
and
smiled
sweetly
she
leaned
back
in
her
garden
chair
and
swung
her
parasol
daintily
back
and
forth
oh
yes
you
are
she
declared
we
all
know
it
so
there
is
no
use
in
your
denying
it
well
you
get
us
some
ices
and
be
quick
about
it
she
dismissed
him
with
a
wave
of
her
beautiful
arm
in
its
flowing
lace
drapery
but
joel
did
not
budge
you
do
know
it
he
swept
the
whole
group
with
his
black
eyes
it
is
as
she
says
is
it
no
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
who
had
laughed
whirling
around
to
bring
a
very
sharp
pair
of
eyes
on
joel
face
it
is
my
boy
well
i
must
say
protested
chatterton
an
angry
light
coming
into
her
cold
eyes
and
turning
around
on
him
sharply
that
this
is
very
friendly
in
you
vandeusen
to
pit
that
upstart
boy
against
me
now
there
will
be
no
managing
him
hereafter
well
but
chatterton
broke
in
one
of
the
other
gentlemen
in
a
propitiatory
voice
and
leaning
over
her
chair
vandeusen
turning
calmly
on
his
heel
to
survey
the
distant
lawns
through
his
monocle
a
beggar
do
you
know
well
it
is
the
pleasantest
thing
in
the
world
to
be
called
that
do
you
know
particularly
when
one
is
a
beggar
said
a
young
lady
hotly
then
she
turned
to
joel
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
do
you
mind
it
she
said
and
as
for
you
miss
tresor
i
should
consider
it
wiser
for
you
to
be
silent
chatterton
turned
on
her
with
venom
what
do
you
know
about
these
miserable
peppers
that
infest
my
cousin
house
pray
tell
i
like
them
declared
miss
tresor
decidedly
not
turning
her
head
mind
it
my
lad
i
do
now
said
joel
then
the
gentlemen
laughed
again
oh
i
must
go
all
his
long
neglect
of
his
duties
made
so
much
worse
by
this
delay
now
surged
over
him
he
raised
his
chubby
face
over
which
a
smile
ran
and
bounded
off
is
he
a
dear
exclaimed
miss
tresor
impulsively
come
away
emily
begged
another
young
lady
seizing
miss
tresor
arm
the
old
cat
is
quite
furious
just
look
at
her
face
we
leave
her
to
mamma
tender
mercies
said
emily
carelessly
she
knows
how
to
handle
her
do
you
remember
that
scene
elinor
at
geneva
do
i
laughed
elinor
as
they
sauntered
off
well
by
the
time
that
six
came
there
was
so
much
as
a
scrap
of
a
letter
left
in
jasper
post
office
but
instead
a
box
crammed
full
of
silver
pieces
and
banknotes
and
miss
mary
taylor
and
hamilton
dyce
and
some
other
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
whom
they
drilled
into
the
service
shut
themselves
up
in
the
library
and
wrote
as
fast
as
ever
they
could
make
their
pens
fly
over
the
paper
till
little
white
piles
appeared
on
the
table
and
percy
and
joel
and
van
and
the
other
boys
would
rush
in
for
these
same
piles
to
put
them
in
the
post
office
to
earn
more
money
to
go
into
the
big
box
so
back
and
forth
ran
these
letter
carriers
until
even
miss
mary
threw
down
her
pen
i
ca
write
another
word
she
cried
i
exhausted
everything
i
can
think
of
i
do
want
to
see
another
letter
and
then
a
card
was
put
up
outside
the
wistaria
arbor
post
office
closed
and
everybody
who
still
had
money
was
anxious
to
spend
it
before
going
home
so
it
was
just
lavished
on
the
the
table
and
the
candy
shop
and
then
when
there
was
anything
more
to
be
bought
or
sold
the
bands
moved
down
nearer
to
the
center
of
the
big
lawn
making
the
gay
little
groups
all
move
back
leaving
a
broad
smooth
surface
for
the
affair
was
to
end
in
dancing
on
the
green
meanwhile
grandpapa
was
gallantly
offering
his
arm
to
madam
dyce
and
leading
her
up
to
an
esplanade
on
the
upper
terrace
and
word
being
spread
about
that
all
the
guests
were
expected
to
follow
there
they
found
seats
and
little
tables
and
a
bevy
of
waiters
to
serve
a
delicious
supper
and
here
the
dancing
on
the
green
below
by
the
young
people
could
be
seen
in
all
its
gayety
the
setting
sun
casting
bright
gleams
upon
the
merry
scene
dear
me
should
you
think
those
young
people
would
be
tired
enough
after
all
they
have
worked
observed
the
old
gentleman
leaning
back
in
his
comfortable
chair
to
sit
still
and
take
it
easy
with
us
here
no
indeed
exclaimed
madam
dyce
my
old
feet
are
actually
twitching
under
my
gown
to
dance
too
in
that
case
observed
old
king
most
gallantly
let
me
lead
you
down
and
will
you
give
me
the
honor
he
bent
his
white
hair
to
the
level
of
her
hand
no
indeed
laughed
madam
dyce
i
will
leave
the
field
for
the
young
people
but
it
carries
me
back
to
my
youth
when
you
and
i
did
dance
many
a
time
together
horatio
did
we
not
laughed
grandpapa
too
and
then
up
came
some
merry
groups
tired
of
dancing
after
some
supper
when
down
they
would
go
again
fortified
and
refreshed
to
begin
it
all
over
once
more
at
last
even
the
lingering
ones
were
obliged
to
say
the
evening
had
shut
in
and
the
brilliant
garden
party
was
a
thing
of
the
past
the
king
household
was
resting
and
talking
it
all
over
on
the
spacious
veranda
luxurious
in
its
cushions
and
rugs
its
and
hammocks
oh
it
has
been
so
perfectly
beatific
exclaimed
polly
in
a
rapture
she
was
curled
up
on
the
top
step
her
head
in
grandpapa
lap
who
was
ensconced
in
a
big
chair
with
phronsie
tired
little
face
snuggled
up
on
his
breast
has
it
alexia
for
alexia
was
going
to
stay
over
night
oh
my
alexia
gave
a
sigh
and
squeezed
polly
hand
i
never
had
such
a
good
time
in
all
my
life
polly
pepper
she
declared
the
poor
children
wo
begin
to
get
the
fun
out
of
it
that
we
had
oh
those
dear
poor
children
exclaimed
polly
stretching
out
her
toes
which
now
began
to
ache
dreadfully
just
think
how
perfectly
lovely
going
to
be
for
them
all
summer
alexia
joel
caught
the
last
words
he
poked
up
his
head
from
one
of
the
hammocks
well
i
guess
cabot
has
helped
a
poor
child
to
go
into
the
country
he
cried
in
a
pleased
tone
i
guess
everybody
has
helped
observed
ben
the
way
your
letters
went
jasper
who
would
think
so
many
could
have
been
sold
jasper
stopped
pulling
prince
ears

they
go

cried
in
huge
satisfaction

glad
to

big
bill
jasper
shouted
joel
my
was

good
to

jasper
everybody
was
chatting
and
laughing
so
it
strange
that

be
heard
the
first
time
so
joel
shouted
it
again
glad
to
be
allowed
to
scream
such
a
splendid
contribution
over
and
over
the
big
bill
was
it
prime
jasper

jasper
stopping
his
play
with
prince

terribly
in
earnest
over
something
why
the
big
bill
i
gave
you
that
cabot
sent
hurrah
was
it
fine
joel
kicked
up
his
heels
and
emitted
a
whistle
that
made
polly
clap
her
hands
over
her
ears
what
big
bill
exclaimed
jasper
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
joe
joel
tumbled
out
of
the
hammock
and
took
long
leaps
across
the
piazza
floor
which
landed
him
in
front
of
jasper
why
that
bill
i
gave
you
that
cabot
sent
to
the
post
office

in
a
puzzle

jasper
x
trouble
for
joel
there
was
an
awful
pause
for
everybody
caught
the
last
words
joel
slid
to
the
floor
in
a
little
heap
chatterton
spoke
up
quickly
it
easy
enough
to
see
where
it
went
and
she
gave
a
little
laugh
come
on
joe
jasper
sprang
up
and
shook
joel
arm
we
go
and
hunt
for
it

and
percy
screamed
it
together
now
that

to
joel
each
vied
with
the
other
to
see
which
could
work
the
faster
to
help
matters
i
laid
it
right
down
oh
dear
me
joel
was
pretty
far
gone
in
distress
by
this
time
and
blubbered
miserably
as
they
all
raced
across
the
greensward
polly
and
alexia
following
swiftly
hold
on
there
james
ordered
jasper
to
one
of
the
three
men
busy
dismantling
the
post
office
of
its
improvised
trimmings
of
pine
branches

arbor
in
the
thickest
of
the
green
branches
scattered
over

boys

picking
and
pulling
wildly
everywhere

banknote

supposed
to
hide
what

banknote
said
jasper
down
on
his
knees
prowling
over
the
floor
with
both
hands
while
joel
who

for
the
tears
that
streamed
down
his
chubby

the
pleasures
of

a
big
dell
in
process
of
filling
up
with
just
such
debris
as
had
now
been
added

old
sweet
dump

because

with
a
sigh

be
a
boy
so
we
much
better
keep
at
work
hunting
for
that
bill
alexia
and
joel
is
so
dreadfully
careless
said
alexia
determined
to
grumble
at
something
and
poking
aimlessly
at
the
green
branches
scattered
on
the
floor
i
do
suppose
we
ever
find
it
in
all
this
world
in
such
a
mess
we
must
said
polly
a
little
white
line
coming
around
her
mouth
well
we
ca
so
what
the
use
of
saying
that
and
alexia
gave
a
restful
stretch
to
her
long
arms
oh

i
so
tired
polly
pepper

bill
alexia
repeated
polly
hoarsely
working
busily
away
for

life

we
ca
it
perfectly
hopeless
so
do
keep
still
just
look
at
all
this
alexia
waved
her
arms
at
the
green
draperies
i
going
to
pull
the
rest
down
anyway
though
that
be
fun
and
she
made
a
dash
at
it
no
no
said
polly
on
her
knees
on
the
floor
we
must
leave
all
that
till
jasper
comes
back
come
alexia
help
me
look
over
these
oh

cried
alexia
in
great
disdain
i
do
want
to
poke
over
those
old
things
you
know
yourself
it
no
earthly
use
we
never
find
it
in
all
this
world
polly
pepper
there
was
a
queer
little
sound
and
alexia
whirling
around
saw
polly
pepper
in
a
little
heap
down
in
the
middle
of
the
green
branches
oh
misery
what
have
i
done
rushing
over
to
her
and
shaking
her
arms
oh
polly

i
positively

get
up
polly
but
polly
did
stir
oh

me
wailed
alexia
polly

she
ran
all
around
her
wringing
her
hands
oh

i
say

for
polly
polly
pepper
we
find
it
as
sure
as
anything
we
ca
help
but

it
polly

up
she
flung
herself
down
on
her
knees
and
began
to
pat
the
white
face
polly
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
her
what
did
you
say
such
dreadful
things
for
alexia
she
said
reproachfully
oh
i
could
help
it
exclaimed
alexia
remorsefully
there
oh
dear
me
you
scared
me
to
death
polly
pepper
do
get
up
so
polly
sat
straight
and
alexia
fussed
over
her
all
the
while
repeating
we
will
find
it
polly
dear
me
said
polly
this
is
hunting
for
that
bill
well
what
the
use
began
alexia
oh
yes
of
course
we
find
it
she
brought
herself
up
quickly
now
polly
i
tell
you
she
sprang
to
her
feet
let
clear
a
place
in
this
corner
and
she
rushed
over
to
it
and
then
pick
up
every
branch
and
shake
it
and
put
it
over
here
then
know
surely
whether
that
horrid
thing
is
on
the
floor
or
not
so
we
shall
cried
polly
getting
up
on
her
feet
that
fine
alexia
and
they
set
to
work
so
busily
they
did
hear
when
the
boys
came
back
from
their
search
but
the
first
moment
she
saw
jasper
face
polly
knew
that
the
hunt
was
unsuccessful
and
the
next
minute
joel
threw
himself
into
her
arms
and
hugged
her
closely
oh
polly
he
sobbed
it
gone
and
it
my
fault
cheer
up
old
fellow
said
jasper
clapping
him
on
the
back
we
find
it
yet
van
and
percy
stood
dismally
by
knocking
their
heels
against
the
arbor
side
and
feeling
quite
sure
they
should
burst
out
crying
in
another
minute
if
joel
did
stop
polly
patted
his
poor
head
and
cuddled
it
in
her
neck
oh
joey
find
it
she
said
swallowing
a
big
lump
in
her
throat
do
cry
dear
while
alexia
sniffed
and
wrung
her
hands
fiercely
turning
her
back
on
them
all
now
boys
said
jasper
in
his
cheeriest
fashion
we
all
set
to
work
on
these
vines
that
are
left
come
on
now
and
let
see
who
will
work
the
fastest
i
will
announced
van
rushing
over
to
twitch
down
the
green
drapery
that
had
been
such
a
piece
of
work
for
the
gardeners
to
put
up
percy
said
nothing
but
set
to
work
quietly
lifting
each
branch
to
peer
under
it
take
care
warned
jasper
pausing
a
minute
in
his
own
work
to
look
over
at
van
reckless
fingers
you
must
shake
each
one
as
you
pull
it
down
before
you
throw
it
out
on
the
grass
else
we
have
all
our
work
to
do
over
again
oh
alexia
are
you
coming
to
help
of
course
i
am
declared
alexia
oh
van
what
a
piece
of
work
you
are
making
polly
was
whispering
to
joel
we
ought
to
help
when
van
gave
a
shout
i
found
it
i
found
it
hurrah
jasper
leapt
down
from
the
railing
and
plunged
up
in
great
excitement
to
polly
and
joel
there
old
fellow
what
did
i
tell
you
he
cried
with
glowing
face
and
clapping
joel
on
the
back
again
phoh
exclaimed
percy
in
great
contempt
he
has
either
it
only
a
bit
of
green
paper
i
thought
i
had
said
van
quite
crestfallen
and
flinging
down
the
dingy
bit
it
looked
just
like
it
it
was
too
much
and
joel
who
had
hopped
out
of
polly
lap
flung
himself
on
the
floor
and
cried
as
if
his
heart
would
break
they
could
get
him
out
of
it
so
jasper
just
picked
him
up
and
marched
off
to
the
house
with
him
to
give
him
to
mother
fisher
and
the
next
morning
search
as
hard
as
they
could
and
everybody
was
hunting
by
that
time
not
a
trace
of
the
bill
could
be
discovered
and
chatterton
took
pains
to
waylay
joel
in
the
hall
or
on
the
stairs
at
all
possible
opportunities
and
ask
him
with
a
smile
at
his
swollen
nose
and
eyes
for
he
had
cried
so
he
could
hardly
see
if
he
had
found
it
yet
but
these
chances
became
very
few
for
it
was
jasper
and
polly
very
especial
business
to
keep
guard
over
joel
and
try
to
divert
him
in
every
way
meantime
the
hunt
went
on
and
the
third
day
when
it
became
perfectly
apparent
to
the
entire
household
that
the
banknote
was
in
such
a
clever
that
no
one
could
find
it
joel
his
tears
all
gone
marched
into
king
and
up
to
his
big
table
and
without
a
bit
of
warning
burst
out
i
want
to
sell
tin
eh
what
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
looking
over
his
glasses
what
is
that
you
are
saying
joey
my
boy
i
want
to
sell
tin
said
joel
bluntly
want
to
sell
tin
ejaculated
old
king
in
amazement
yes
sir
just
like
biggs
he
got
lots
of
money
may
i
grandpapa
please
say
i
may
joel
ran
around
the
to
plant
himself
by
the
old
gentleman
chair
oh
my
goodness
exclaimed
king
leaning
back
in
dismay
whatever
can
you
mean
my
boy
grandpapa
joel
laid
a
brown
hand
on
the
velvet
and
brought
his
black
eyes
very
close
to
the
gentleman
face
i
got
to
earn
that
ten
dollars
i
got
to
grandpapa
i
lost
it
voice
broke
here
but
he
recovered
it
and
dashed
on
and
i
ca
do
it
unless
you
will
let
me
sell
tin
grandpapa
dear
biggs
used
to
in
badgertown
you
know
and
he
took
me
with
him
sometimes
on
his
cart
so
i
know
how
and
i
can
sell
a
lot
i
can
wheel
it
in
my
express
wagon
and
joel
by
this
time
was
running
on
so
glibly
under
the
impression
that
if
he
did
stop
king
would
be
induced
to
say
yes
that
the
old
gentleman
was
forced
to
put
up
his
hand
peremptorily
there
there
joey
my
boy
he
said
settling
his
glasses
that
had
slipped
to
the
end
of
his
nose
and
taking
joel
hand
now
then
hear
all
about
the
matter
and
in
a
minute
or
two
joel
was
perched
on
the
old
gentleman
knee
and
they
were
having
the
most
sociable
time
possible
and
before
long
joel
forgot
he
had
laughed
for
oh
such
a
long
while
and
lo
and
behold
grandpapa
said
something
so
very
funny
that
they
both
burst
out
into
a
merry
peal
that
rang
out
into
the
wide
hall
beyond
joel
is
actually
laughing
exclaimed
polly
coming
soberly
down
the
stairs
and
she
was
so
overcome
by
the
joyful
sound
that
she
sat
right
down
on
the
step
oh
dear
me
how
perfectly
lovely
she
breathed
folding
her
hands
in
delight
is
it
jasper
slipped
into
a
seat
on
the
step
by
her
side
now
everything
is
going
to
be
fine
when
joe
can
laugh
just
hear
him
cried
polly
pricking
up
her
ears
to
catch
the
blissful
sound
and
grandpapa
too
oh
jasper
i
know
it
said
jasper
in
great
satisfaction
father
has
been
so
pulled
down
because
joe
took
it
so
hard
well
you
see
joel
could
help
it
cried
polly
because
it
was
careless
just
as
mamsie
said
to
leave
anything
without
handing
it
to
the
person
of
course
assented
jasper
quickly
fisher
is
right
but
i
sure
any
one
is
likely
to
do
it
and
joel
was
in
such
a
hurry
that
day
everybody
pulling
at
him
this
way
and
that
to
get
letters
i
know
it
said
polly
delighted
to
hear
joel
part
taken
and
just
think
how
he
worked
before
jasper
he
helped
such
a
perfect
lot
getting
the
ready
he
helped
everywhere
declared
jasper
bringing
down
his
hand
with
emphasis
on
his
knee
i
never
saw
anybody
work
as
joe
did
and
now
to
think
that
he
has
lost
that
money
mourned
polly
her
head
drooping
sorrowfully
over
her
closed
hands
oh
dear
me
jasper
but
just
hear
him
laugh
cried
jasper
springing
up
it
going
to
be
all
right
now
polly
i
do
believe
come
let
go
and
hunt
some
more
for
the
banknote
so
they
both
flew
off
from
the
stairs
to
begin
the
search
for
the
money
again
for
no
one
stopped
dear
me
not
a
bit
of
it
the
hunt
for
the
hidden
bill
everybody
but
phronsie
and
little
dick
searched
and
prowled
in
every
nook
and
corner
where
there
was
the
least
possible
chance
that
the
bill
could
be
in
hiding
they
had
both
been
so
sleepy
on
the
evening
of
the
garden
party
when
the
loss
had
been
announced
that
it
fell
unheeded
on
their
ears
and
afterward
all
the
household
was
careful
to
keep
the
bad
news
from
them
so
the
two
children
went
on
in
blissful
unconsciousness
of
joel
trouble
while
the
grand
hunt
proceeded
all
around
them
when
joel
emerged
from
grandpapa
king
he
was
hanging
to
the
old
gentleman
hand
and
looking
up
into
his
face
and
chattering
away
you
know
it
means
work
said
old
king
looking
down
at
him
i
know
grandpapa
said
joel
bobbing
his
stubby
black
head
and
you
must
keep
at
it
said
the
old
gentleman
decidedly
else
no
pay
there
to
be
no
dropping
the
job
once
you
take
it
up
if
you
do
get
no
money
that
the
bargain
joe
with
a
keen
glance
into
the
chubby
face
oh
i
will
grandpapa
i
will
declared
joel
eagerly
and
hopping
up
and
down
i
do
every
single
speck
of
the
work
now
do
let
us
hurry
and
get
the
book
yes
we
hurry
seeing
our
business
arrangement
is
all
settled
laughed
the
old
gentleman
now
then
joel
my
boy
we
go
and
buy
the
blank
book
so
that
i
can
set
you
to
work
at
once
and
he
grasped
the
brown
hand
tightly
and
away
they
went
and
in
ten
minutes
everybody
knew
that
joel
was
going
to
make
a
list
of
all
the
books
in
a
certain
case
in
old
king
and
that
grandpapa
and
he
were
already
off
to
buy
a
new
blank
book
for
the
work
and
at
the
end
of
it
oh
joy
joel
was
to
have
a
crisp
bill
to
replace
the
one
he
had
lost
xi
rachel
here
she
comes
roared
tisbett
the
townspeople
hurrying
to
badgertown
depot
to
see
the
train
bearing
the
new
little
girl
sent
on
by
fisher
to
their
parson
care
crowded
up
and
henderson
smilingly
in
the
center
of
the
biggest
group
oh
husband
i
do
pity
her
so
breathed
the
parson
wife
poor
thing
she
will
be
so
shy
and
distressed
the
parson
heart
gave
a
responsive
thrill
as
he
craned
his
neck
to
peer
here
and
there
for
their
new
charge
she
has
come
oh
dear
me
as
a
voice
broke
in
at
his
elbow
i
here
the
words
were
much
to
be
sure
but
the
tone
was
wholly
and
when
the
parson
whirled
around
and
henderson
who
had
been
looking
the
other
way
brought
her
gaze
back
they
saw
a
little
girl
in
a
dark
brown
suit
a
brown
hat
under
which
fell
smooth
braids
of
black
hair
who
was
regarding
them
with
a
pair
of
the
keenest
eyes
they
had
either
of
them
ever
seen
oh
oh
my
child
stammered
henderson
putting
out
a
kind
hand
so
you
have
come
rachel
yes
i
am
rachel
said
the
child
looking
up
into
his
face
and
laying
her
hand
in
the
parson
big
one
then
she
turned
her
full
regard
upon
the
minister
wife
henderson
was
divided
in
her
mind
for
an
instant
whether
to
kiss
this
child
as
she
had
fully
arranged
in
her
mind
beforehand
to
do
or
to
let
such
a
ceremony
go
by
but
in
a
breathing
space
she
had
her
arms
about
her
and
was
drawing
her
to
her
breast
rachel
dear
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
to
us
rachel
glanced
up
sharply
heaved
a
big
sigh
and
when
she
lifted
her
head
from
henderson
neck
there
was
something
bright
that
glistened
in
either
eye
she
brushed
it
off
before
any
one
could
spy
it
as
the
parson
was
saying
and
now
where
is
your
bag
child
er
rachel
i
mean
rachel
pointed
to
the
end
of
the
platform
i
go
an
tell
to
bring
it
here
no
no
child
the
parson
started
briskly
let
us
all
go
said
henderson
kindly
gathering
rachel
hand
up
in
one
of
hers
come
dear
so
off
they
hurried
the
platform
length
the
farmers
and
their
wives
looking
after
them
with
the
greatest
interest
my
but
ai
henderson
glad
to
get
a
girl
though
yes
she
sets
by
her
sakes
alive
i
thought
she
was
a
poor
child
exclaimed
one
woman
who
was
dreadfully
disappointed
to
lose
the
anticipated
object
of
charity
so
she
is
cried
another
as
poor
as
job
turkey
but
king
has
dressed
her
up
you
know
an
he
goin
to
edicate
her
too
well
she
pay
for
it
i
reckon
my
she
looks
smart
even
the
back
of
her
and
before
very
long
rachel
had
been
inducted
into
her
room
a
pretty
little
one
under
the
eaves
neat
as
a
pin
in
chintz
covering
around
which
she
had
given
a
swift
glance
of
approval
and
now
she
was
down
in
the
parsonage
kitchen
in
a
calico
gown
and
checked
apron
her
own
new
brown
ribbons
having
been
taken
off
from
her
braids
rolled
up
carefully
and
laid
in
the
top
drawer
the
common
ones
taking
their
places
peletiah
and
ezekiel
were
each
in
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
with
their
pale
blue
eyes
riveted
on
her
well
dear
henderson
greeted
her
kindly
you
have
changed
your
gown
very
quickly
a
tall
woman
stalked
in
from
the
little
entry
oh
jerusha
exclaimed
henderson
pleasantly
this
is
the
little
girl
that
fisher
sent
us
rachel
go
up
and
speak
to
miss
jerusha
rachel
went
over
obediently
and
put
out
her
hand
which
the
parson
sister
did
seem
to
see
instead
she
drew
herself
up
stiffer
than
ever
and
stared
at
the
child
ah
well
i
hope
she
wo
forget
that
she
very
poor
and
that
taken
her
out
of
pity
said
miss
jerusha
rachel
started
back
as
if
shot
and
her
black
eyes
flashed
i
ai
poor
she
screamed
i
ai
goin
to
be
pitied
yes
you
are
too
declared
miss
jerusha
quite
pleased
at
the
effect
of
her
words
and
telling
off
each
syllable
by
bringing
one
set
of
bony
fingers
down
on
the
other
emphatically
in
fact
you
a
beggar
and
my
brother
i
ai
ai
ai
screamed
rachel
shrilly
and
flinging
herself
on
her
face
on
the
floor
she
flapped
her
feet
up
and
down
and
writhed
in
distress
i
want
to
go
home
she
sobbed
the
boys
for
once
in
their
lives
actually
started
and
presently
they
were
across
the
kitchen
to
their
mother
kneeling
by
rachel
side
do
let
her
go
they
said
together
she
is
going
said
henderson
smoothing
the
shaking
shoulders
but
rachel
screamed
on
dear
me
the
parson
hurried
in
at
the
uproar
his
glasses
set
up
on
his
forehead
where
his
nervous
fingers
had
pushed
them
what
is
the
matter
that
poor
child
answered
miss
jerusha
pointing
a
long
finger
over
at
the
group
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
is
acting
like
satan
i
guess
you
repent
brother
ever
bringing
her
here
was
aunt
jerusha
declared
peletiah
bluntly
and
i
wish
she
go
home
hush
hush
dear
said
his
mother
looking
up
into
his
face
there
was
an
awful
pause
the
parson
drew
a
long
breath
then
he
turned
to
his
sister
jerusha
he
said
i
wish
you
would
go
into
the
if
you
please
an
let
you
pet
that
beggar
child
she
exclaimed
in
shrill
scorn
but
she
stalked
off
henderson
went
swiftly
across
the
kitchen
and
knelt
down
by
his
wife
rachel
he
put
his
hand
on
the
little
girl
head
get
directly
up
my
child
rachel
lifted
her
eyes
and
peered
about
has
she
gone
that
dreadful
bad
old
woman
there
is
no
one
here
but
those
who
love
you
said
the
minister
now
child
get
directly
up
and
sit
in
that
chair
he
indicated
the
one
and
in
a
minute
rachel
was
perched
on
it
with
streaming
eyes
peletiah
having
started
to
get
a
towel
and
in
his
trepidation
presenting
the
the
parson
dried
her
tears
on
his
own
handkerchief
now
then
that
is
better
he
said
in
satisfaction
as
they
all
grouped
around
her
chair
rachel
there
must
be
anything
of
this
sort
tears
i
mean
again
that
lady
is
my
sister
and
your
sister
screamed
rachel
precipitating
herself
forward
on
her
chair
in
imminent
danger
of
falling
on
her
nose
to
gaze
at
him
in
amazement
yes
a
dull
red
flush
crept
over
the
minister
face
and
and
whatever
she
says
rachel
why
you
are
not
to
mind
child
she
ai
to
sass
me
declared
rachel
stoutly
well
i
do
believe
she
will
again
let
us
hope
not
said
henderson
in
a
worried
way
however
you
are
not
to
cry
remember
that
rachel
whatever
happens
he
added
firmly
you
are
to
be
happy
here
this
is
your
home
and
we
all
love
you
you
do
said
rachel
much
amazed
looking
at
them
all
oh
well
then
i
stay
and
slipping
down
from
her
chair
she
seized
apron
what
i
do
fisher
told
me
how
to
wash
dishes
may
i
do
yes
and
the
boys
shall
wipe
them
said
henderson
and
pretty
soon
there
was
a
gay
little
bustle
in
the
old
kitchen
the
parson
staying
away
from
the
writing
of
the
sermon
to
see
it
but
peletiah
and
ezekiel
were
much
too
slow
to
suit
rachel
who
got
far
ahead
of
them
so
she
flew
to
the
drawer
in
the
big
table
where
she
had
seen
them
get
the
and
helping
herself
she
fell
to
work
drying
some
of
the
big
pile
in
the
drainer
in
the
sink
i
do
see
how
you
can
go
so
fast
observed
peletiah
laboriously
polishing
up
his
plate
well
i
do
see
how
you
can
go
so
slow
retorted
rachel
with
deft
passes
of
the
towel
over
the
cup
my
i
sh
think
your
elbows
had
gone
to
sleep
they
have
gone
to
sleep
said
peletiah
who
was
always
literal
and
setting
down
his
plate
on
the
table
he
turned
over
one
arm
to
investigate
of
course
not
you
little
ninny
said
rachel
lightly
i
did
rachel
rachel
said
the
parson
wife
over
by
the
table
she
was
getting
her
material
together
for
baking
pies
and
she
now
added
gently
we
do
call
each
other
names
you
must
remember
that
child
oh
said
rachel
she
stopped
her
busy
towel
a
minute
to
think
then
it
flapped
harder
and
faster
to
make
up
for
lost
time
well
go
ahead
she
said
to
peletiah
and
wipe
your
plate
so
peletiah
letting
his
elbows
take
care
of
themselves
picked
up
his
plate
and
set
to
work
on
its
surface
again
and
pretty
soon
the
dishes
were
all
declared
done
the
pan
and
mop
washed
out
and
hung
up
what
i
do
next
rachel
smoothed
down
her
apron
and
stood
before
the
a
boy
on
either
side
now
boys
said
henderson
pausing
in
her
work
of
rolling
out
the
pie
crust
i
think
you
had
better
take
rachel
down
to
see
grandma
bascom
i
told
her
she
coming
and
she
quite
impatient
to
see
her
and
rachel
you
can
tell
her
about
fisher
and
polly
and
the
boys
and
oh
rachel
be
sure
to
tell
her
about
phronsie
she
does
just
love
that
child
so
the
parson
wife
leaned
on
the
and
a
bright
color
came
into
her
face
i
tell
her
said
rachel
a
soft
gleam
in
her
eyes
and
smoothing
her
apron
and
peletiah
go
into
the
buttery
and
get
that
little
pat
of
butter
done
up
in
a
cloth
and
give
it
to
grandma
i
do
wish
my
pies
were
baked
and
she
fell
to
work
again
so
i
could
send
her
one
so
peletiah
went
into
the
buttery
and
got
the
pat
of
butter
and
the
three
started
off
the
parson
stepped
away
from
the
doorway
into
the
entry
where
he
had
been
silently
watching
proceedings
and
went
over
to
the
window
come
here
almira
he
held
out
his
hand
she
dropped
her
and
ran
over
to
his
side
he
drew
her
to
him
see
dear
he
said
rachel
and
the
two
boys
were
proceeding
over
the
greensward
leading
down
the
road
she
had
one
on
either
side
and
wonder
of
wonders
they
were
all
hand
in
hand
we
going
to
see
your
gran
said
rachel
a
very
sober
expression
settling
over
her
thin
little
face
what
said
peletiah
your
gran
that
what
your
mother
said
oh
no
she
did
contradicted
peletiah
we
are
going
to
grandma
bascom
well
that
the
same
thing
said
rachel
she
your
gran
is
she
she
grandma
bascom
repeated
peletiah
stolidly
oh
dear
me
of
course
but
she
gran
is
she
her
tongue
fairly
aching
to
call
him
ninny
again
no
she
is
she
is
any
one
gran
she
just
grandma
bascom
oh
said
rachel
perhaps
it
was
so
very
bad
as
she
feared
she
would
wait
and
see
she
dreadfully
deaf
remarked
peletiah
what
that
she
ca
hear
unless
you
scream
rachel
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
but
it
was
very
musical
and
before
they
knew
it
although
they
were
very
much
astonished
the
two
boys
were
laughing
too
though
they
had
the
least
idea
at
what
i
glad
of
it
announced
rachel
when
she
had
gotten
through
i
love
to
scream
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
i
die
if
i
could
do
you
no
i
do
said
peletiah
ever
feel
so
do
rachel
leaned
over
to
peer
into
ezekiel
face
no
i
do
either
he
said
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
rachel
catching
her
breath
well
let
run
and
before
either
boy
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
she
was
hauling
them
along
at
such
a
mad
pace
as
they
had
never
before
in
all
their
lives
indulged
in
the
slipped
out
of
peletiah
hand
gone
on
the
wind
and
landed
on
the
roadside
grass
was
that
a
good
one
cried
rachel
her
eyes
shining
as
she
brought
up
suddenly
oh
my
ai
things
sweet
though
wrinkling
up
her
nose
in
delight
i
lost
the
observed
peletiah
when
he
could
get
his
breath
i
never
see
anything
so
beautiful
rachel
was
saying
over
and
over
then
she
flung
herself
flat
on
the
grass
and
buried
her
nose
in
it
smelling
it
hungrily
oh
my
i
lost
the
observed
peletiah
again
and
standing
over
her
and
i
to
live
here
declared
rachel
in
a
transport
and
wriggling
in
the
sweet
clover
if
i
good
i
goin
to
be
good
all
the
time
yes
sir
i
lost
the
repeated
peletiah
rachel
caught
the
last
words
and
sprang
to
her
feet
oh
yes
i
forgot
we
must
hurry
with
the
come
on
and
she
whirled
around
on
peletiah
why
where
as
she
saw
his
empty
hands
i
lost
the
said
peletiah
i
been
telling
you
so
no
you
have
contradicted
rachel
flatly
yes
i
have
said
peletiah
stolidly
no
such
thing
rachel
squared
up
to
him
her
black
eyes
flashing
you
have
said
a
single
word
you
bad
wicked
boy
yes
i
have
repeated
peletiah
ready
to
say
it
over
for
all
time
told
you
so
a
great
many
times
rachel
looked
at
him
and
put
up
both
hands
the
only
thing
proper
to
do
under
such
circumstances
was
to
shake
him
smartly
but
it
seemed
so
like
attacking
a
granite
post
and
besides
he
was
the
minister
son
and
she
was
going
to
be
good
else
they
must
send
her
away
so
fisher
had
said
so
her
arms
flopped
down
to
her
side
and
hung
there
dismally
and
she
burst
out
where
did
you
lose
it
you
nin
i
mean
oh
dear
me
where
i
say
frowning
impatiently
back
there
said
peletiah
pointing
down
the
road
you
pulled
me
along
so
it
flew
out
of
my
hand
rachel
set
her
teeth
together
hard
come
on
she
seized
a
hand
of
each
boy
ezekiel
being
a
silent
spectator
all
the
time
and
if
they
went
fast
before
this
time
in
retracing
their
steps
it
might
be
called
flying
till
a
little
spot
on
the
roadside
grass
showed
the
object
of
their
search
peletiah
breath
was
gone
entirely
by
this
time
and
he
sank
down
by
its
side
without
a
word
his
brother
following
suit
i
shall
carry
it
now
announced
rachel
gathering
up
the
little
pat
safe
in
its
white
cloth
my
hurt
a
bit
she
brushed
off
a
few
marauding
ants
come
on
now
peletiah
struggled
to
his
feet
and
gasped
i
shall
carry
it
and
put
out
his
hands
no
such
thing
rachel
held
the
firmly
in
her
slender
brown
hand
my
you
ai
fit
to
carry
no
let
drop
out
of
your
hands
come
on
i
shall
carry
it
declared
peletiah
doggedly
and
bringing
his
pale
eyes
to
bear
on
her
face
while
he
stood
still
in
his
tracks
i
hope
you
may
get
it
cried
rachel
triumphantly
i
never
see
such
a
boy
come
on
i
say
she
held
out
her
hand
with
authority
my
mother
said
i
was
to
carry
the
and
i
shall
carry
it
said
peletiah
putting
out
one
hand
for
it
and
the
other
behind
his
back
rachel
wrinkled
her
brows
and
thought
a
minute
so
she
did
she
said
then
she
set
the
in
peletiah
hand
and
pinched
his
thumb
down
over
it
there
hold
on
to
it
she
said
or
you
lose
it
again
now
come
on
the
way
back
was
conducted
on
slower
lines
as
rachel
had
an
anxious
oversight
lest
the
should
again
be
taken
off
on
the
wind
so
that
peletiah
and
ezekiel
had
a
chance
to
recover
their
breath
with
some
degree
of
composure
by
the
time
they
turned
down
the
lane
to
grandma
bascom
there
she
was
sitting
in
her
big
chair
resting
after
the
morning
work
as
they
found
on
entering
the
little
old
kitchen
rachel
eyes
had
been
getting
bigger
and
bigger
though
she
had
said
nothing
tip
to
this
time
but
when
they
rested
on
the
old
lady
face
under
the
big
frilled
cap
she
burst
out
sharply
is
that
your
gran
she
is
my
gran
replied
peletiah
no

echoed
ezekiel
well

demanded
rachel
impatiently

said
peletiah
shaking
his
head
of
stiff
light
hair
oh

you
said
so
cried
rachel
in
a
high
disappointed
key
oh
dear
dear
dear
i
wish
she
was
and
terribly
afraid
she
was
going
to
cry
she
marched
off
to
the
window
and
twisted
her
fingers
into
knots
she
grandma
said
ezekiel
walking
over
to
her
and
peering
around
her
side
oh
then
she
is
cried
rachel
springing
around
say
she
seized
his
jacket
she
my
gran
an
grandma

said
repeated
ezekiel
yes

grandma
well
she

ezekiel
decidedly

she

declared
rachel
bobbing
her
head
decidedly

gran
grandma

ezekiel
in
alarm
i
ai
goin
to

do
want

goin
to
live
here
always
forever
declared
rachel
firmly
ezekiel
smiled
at
that
in
great
satisfaction
and
the
matter
being
settled
rachel
skipped
over
to
the
old
lady
chair
and
looked
steadily
down
into
the
wrinkled
face
go
out
and
put
the
somewhere
she
said
to
peletiah
who
still
held
it
in
his
hand
waiting
to
present
it
i
must
give
it
to
grandma
he
said
my
mother
told
me
to
well

ca
while
she
asleep
said
rachel
quickly
so
you
put
it
somewhere
anywhere
and
when
she
wakes
up
why
you
can
give
it
to
her
do
hurry
and
you
go
and
help
him
so
the
two
boys
walked
off
to
find
a
place
in
the
buttery
and
quick
as
lightning
rachel
leaned
over
and
set
a
kiss
on
the
wrinkled
old
cheek
if
grandma
could
hear
she
was
very
quick
at
feeling
why
she
stirred
uneasily
in
her
chair
and
opened
her
eyes
who
is
this
she
asked
staring
at
the
strange
little
girl
for
although
the
parson
wife
had
told
her
all
about
the
new
member
of
the
family
to
come
that
day
grandma
was
so
bewildered
by
being
suddenly
aroused
from
her
sleep
she
had
forgotten
all
about
it
hey
who
is
it
peletiah
not
having
had
time
to
put
down
the
now
came
up
and
presented
it
with
all
due
formality
but
who
is
this
little
gal
asked
grandma
as
he
set
the
in
the
middle
of
the
checked
apron
over
her
lap
she
rachel
said
peletiah
eh
what
grandma
held
a
shaking
hand
behind
her
ear
speak
a
little
louder
peletiah
you
know
i
hard
o
hearin
just
a
grain
rachel
shouted
peletiah
as
he
stood
still
in
his
tracks
in
front
of
her
ai
well
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
grandma
in
a
tone
of
great
concern
what
a
pity
and
she
turned
and
regarded
the
stranger
with
anxiety
oh
dear
me
you
get
away
peletiah
commanded
rachel
brushing
him
aside
so
peletiah
very
glad
to
be
released
moved
off
and
rachel
putting
her
mouth
to
the
nodding
said
very
distinctly

minute
rachel
was
telling
all
about
fisher
and
polly
and
phronsie
oh
and
joel
and
david
for
grandma
kept
interrupting
and
asking
all
sorts
of
questions
so
that
the
news
and
messages
were
all
tangled
up
together
did
joel
say
he
wanted
asked
grandma
in
a
lull
oh
yes
he
said
yours
were
awful
good
and
he
wished
he
had
some
of
rachel
answered
she
did
dare
take
her
mouth
away
from
the
and
her
feet
ached
dreadfully
from
standing
still
so
long
but
grandma
was
as
bright
as
a
button
and
hungry
for
every
scrap
of
information
land
o
goshen
mourned
grandma
how
i
wish
he
was
comin
in
now
i
give
him
plenty
she
sat
still
for
a
minute
lost
in
thought
peletiah
and
ezekiel
had
wandered
off
outside
where
they
sat
under
the
lilac
bushes
to
rest
after
their
unwonted
exercise
so
the
hens
undisturbed
stepped
over
the
sill
of
the
kitchen
door
and
scratched
and
picked
about
to
their
hearts
content
i
drive
out
said
rachel
delighted
at
the
chance
of
action
this
would
give
her
and
springing
off
take
the
broom
screamed
grandma
after
her
and
then
hurry
and
come
back
and
tell
me
some
more
so
rachel
wishing
the
duty
could
be
an
hour
long
shooed
and
waved
her
broom
wildly
and
ran
and
raced
and
the
fat
old
hens
tumbled
over
each
other
to
get
away
and
then
she
came
slowly
back
to
grandma
side
to
go
over
again
every
bit
she
had
told
before
until
looking
up
at
the
old
clock
on
the
shelf
she
saw
that
it
was
one
minute
of
twelve
oh
my
i
got
to
go
she
screamed
in
grandma
ear
and
without
another
word
she
dashed
off
and
up
to
the
lilac
bushes
boys
come
this
minute
she
held
out
both
hands
it
awful
late
i
know
it
said
peletiah
with
a
very
grieved
face
we
been
waiting
for
you
ever
so
long
and
dinner
ready
at
home
well
come
now
she
stuck
her
long
arms
out
straight
and
shook
her
fingers
impatiently
oh
dear
me
do
hurry
i
ai
goin
to
take
hold
of
hands
declared
peletiah
edging
off
nor
i
either
echoed
ezekiel
oh
yes
you
must
and
without
waiting
for
more
words
on
the
matter
rachel
seized
a
hand
of
each
and
bore
off
the
boys
if
they
ran
before
they
flew
now
but
all
the
same
they
were
late
to
dinner
and
the
parson
and
his
wife
and
miss
jerusha
were
all
helped
around
and
had
begun
to
eat
there
see
what
that
new
girl
has
done
already
said
miss
jerusha
sternly
laying
down
her
knife
and
fork
peletiah
and
ezekiel
ai
ever
late
well
you
see
trouble
enough
with
her
or
i
miss
my
guess
peletiah
sank
down
on
the
upper
step
of
the
piazza
but
ezekiel
crept
into
the
kitchen
while
rachel
pushed
boldly
up
to
henderson
chair
oh
i
awful
sorry
she
said
her
face
was
very
flushed
and
her
eyes
glowed
with
the
run
ben
gallivantin
off
an
temptin
the
boys
to
play
declared
miss
jerusha
with
a
shrewd
nod
of
her
brown
front
oh
i
know
we
wo
say
any
more
about
it
now
dear
said
henderson
gently
at
sight
of
the
hot
little
face
there
get
into
your
chair
this
one
next
to
me
where
peletiah
looking
about
oh
i
awful
tired
wailed
ezekiel
slipping
into
his
seat
next
to
the
parson
and
he
drew
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
red
face
ben
playing
so
hard
said
miss
jerusha
disagreeably
an
now
you
all
het
up
i
have
played
a
single
bit
declared
ezekiel
stoutly
and
with
a
very
injured
expression
of
countenance
oh
dear
me
i
am
so
tired
stretching
his
legs
under
the
table
eat
your
dinner
my
son
said
the
parson
putting
a
liberal
portion
on
his
plate
oh
dear
me
ezekiel
essayed
to
but
laid
down
his
spoon
i
do
want
anything
i
so
tired
henderson
cast
an
anxious
glance
over
at
him
no
need
to
worry
her
husband
telegraphed
back
going
quietly
on
with
his
own
dinner
rachel
had
begun
on
hers
with
hungry
zest
but
stopped
suddenly
hopped
out
of
her
chair
and
raced
to
the
door
rachel
it
was
a
loud
voice
but
she
found
herself
back
again
and
looking
into
henderson
face
sit
down
dear
we
do
not
leave
the
table
in
that
way
so
rachel
slipped
into
her
seat
feeling
as
if
all
the
blood
in
her
body
were
in
her
hot
cheeks
now
what
is
it
the
parson
wife
took
one
of
the
brown
hands
working
nervously
under
the
tablecloth
tell
me
do
be
afraid
she
said
softly
but
miss
jerusha
heard
stuff
and
nonsense
she
exclaimed
with
a
sneer
when
i
was
a
child
there
was
no
such
coddlin
goin
on
i
can
tell
you
it
peletiah
said
rachel
oh
dear
me
he
out
on
the
piazza
and
he
must
be
awfully
hungry
ca
i
make
him
come
in
no
sit
still
husband
the
parson
wife
looked
down
the
table
excuse
me
a
minute
she
slipped
out
and
in
another
moment
in
she
came
and
peletiah
with
her
and
then
henderson
told
such
a
funny
story
about
a
monkey
he
had
read
about
only
just
that
very
morning
that
ezekiel
forgot
there
ever
was
such
a
thing
as
tired
legs
and
even
peletiah
had
no
thoughts
for
that
dreadful
run
home
from
grandma
bascom
as
for
rachel
all
idea
of
dinner
flew
at
once
out
of
her
head
she
laid
down
her
knife
and
fork
and
leaned
forward
with
sparkling
eyes
to
catch
every
word
seeing
which
henderson
burst
out
laughing
i
afraid
you
are
making
things
worse
husband
she
said
for
they
wo
eat
any
dinner
at
all
now
i
surely
am
said
the
parson
with
another
laugh
and
i
thought
i
was
going
to
help
so
much
he
added
ruefully
how
you
can
laugh
exclaimed
miss
jerusha
sourly
at
the
good
time
in
progress
and
sitting
quite
stiffly
i
do
for
my
part
see
oh
well
if
you
laugh
more
it
would
be
better
for
all
of
us
jerusha
said
her
brother
i
ai
to
laugh
declared
miss
jerusha
and
it
a
wicked
sinful
shame
to
set
such
an
example
before
those
boys
like
coddlin
up
that
girl
for
keepin
them
off
playin
i
never
see
such
goin
on
we
have
been
playing
said
peletiah
stoutly
i
told
her
so
said
ezekiel
fretfully
seeing
that
his
father
had
no
more
monkey
stories
to
offer
but
she
keeps
saying
it
just
the
same
i
wish
she
go
off
and
play
he
added
vindictively
the
idea
of
miss
jerusha
ever
having
played
made
rachel
turn
in
her
chair
and
regard
her
fixedly
then
she
broke
out
into
a
laugh
it
was
such
a
merry
peal
that
presently
the
boys
joined
in
and
even
the
parson
and
his
wife
had
hard
work
to
keep
their
faces
straight
well
if
i
see
such
goin
on
miss
jerusha
shoved
back
her
chair
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
did
she
ever
play
asked
rachel
when
the
door
into
the
had
slammed
why
yes
of
course
child
said
henderson
with
a
smile
when
she
was
a
little
girl
and
was
she
ever
a
little
girl
persisted
rachel
why
certainly
now
eat
your
dinner
rachel
rachel
picked
up
her
knife
and
fork
when
the
two
boys
saw
that
she
was
ready
to
really
begin
on
her
meal
they
set
to
on
theirs
i
awful
hungry
announced
peletiah
when
he
had
been
working
busily
on
his
plateful
the
parson
burst
out
into
a
laugh
like
a
boy
hush
husband
warned
henderson
i
afraid
jerusha
will
hear
i
ca
help
it
almira
his
eyes
were
brimming
with
amusement
our
boys

declared
peletiah
looking
up
at
his
father
in
amazement
i
eating
my
dinner
so

i
announced
ezekiel
wisely
and
putting
out
his
plate
for
another
potato
so
i
see
said
his
father
gravely
well
now
we
all
getting
on
very
well
he
added
in
great
satisfaction
with
a
glance
around
the
table
you
must
excuse
me
wife
you
know
i
must
get
over
to
the
funeral
early

peletiah
pausing
in
the
act
of
getting
some
gravy
to
his
mouth
yes

attention
to

peletiah

asked

dinner
and
do
say
i
glad
i

observed
peletiah
with
a
long
sigh
of
relief
and
beginning
on
his
dinner
once
more
i
do
like
funerals
i
do
rachel
bobbed
her
black
head
at
him
across
the
table
and
her
eyes
roved
excitedly
i
seen
lots
an
lots
of
in
the
city
they
fine
i
tell
you
she
laid
down
her
knife
and
fork
again
and
waved
her
arms
oh
a
string
of
carriages
as
long
an
the
corpse
is
sometimes
in
a
white
box
and
heaps
of
flowers
i
like
next
to
the
circus
there
there
rachel
eat
your
dinner
child

in
henderson
quickly
and
boys
do
talk
any
more
you
must
get
through
dinner
for
i
have
to
go
to
miss
bedlow
by
two
and
she
got
out
of
her
chair
and
began
to
clear
the
table
so
all
that
was
to
be
heard
now
in
the
parsonage
kitchen
was
the
pleasant
rattle
of
knives
and
forks
and
the
bustle
of
clearing
up
and
presently
the
children
hopped
out
of
their
chairs
and
began
to
help
henderson
to
set
everything
in
order
i
goin
to
wash
every
single
thing
up
announced
rachel
hurrying
for
the
mop
can
you
dear
asked
the
parson
wife
she
was
very
tired
and
yet
had
the
funeral
of
the
old
parishioner
to
attend
but
the
risk
seemed
great
of
allowing
the
new
little
girl
to
do
up
all
the
dinner
dishes
there
are
a
great
many
of
them
and
some
of
them
are
big
glancing
doubtfully
around
the
piles
are
you
sure
you
can
manage
them
why
yes
declared
rachel
in
scorn
i
can
do
all
just
as
easy
she
stopped
to
snap
her
fingers
at
the
greasy
plates
then
ran
over
to
get
the
big
teakettle
on
the
stove
in
a
twinkling
let
peletiah
carry
that
for
you
said
henderson
he
so
slow
said
rachel
but
she
stopped
obediently
rachel
there
is
one
thing
and
the
parson
wife
came
over
and
put
her
hand
on
the
thin
little
shoulder
we
all
help
each
other
in
this
house
and
we
never
talk
against
one
oh
said
rachel
peletiah
by
this
time
had
advanced
on
the
teakettle
and
as
soon
as
he
could
he
bore
it
off
and
solemnly
poured
a
goodly
supply
of
water
into
the
waiting
dishpan
now
you
boys
are
to
wipe
the
dishes
for
rachel
said
their
mother
with
an
approving
glance
at
the
group
i
rather
began
rachel
wrinkling
up
her
face
so
remember
and
when
you
are
through
and
the
kitchen
is
set
up
neatly
you
may
all
play
out
of
doors
this
afternoon

for
you
until

said
peletiah
when
they
were
left
alone

exclaimed
rachel
in
astonishment
and
resting
her
soapy
hands
on
the
edge
of
the
dishpan
no
i
do
declared
peletiah
with
great
deliberation
like
them
at
all
well
i
shall
i
know
rachel
twitched
off
her
hands
and
slapped
the
mop
down
smartly
among
the
cups
in
the
hot
water
ow
you
splashed
me
all
over
exclaimed
ezekiel
see
there
now
rachel
he
stepped
hack
and
held
up
his
arm
phoo
that
nothing
said
rachel
it
hurt
it
hot
said
ezekiel
squirming
about
well
if
you
ai
a
baby
cried
rachel
scornfully
my
mother
said
we
were
to
call
names
observed
peletiah
oh
my
i
forgot
that
but
he
is
a
baby
declared
rachel
my
mother
said
we
were
not
to
call
names
repeated
peletiah
exactly
as
if
he
had
made
that
remark
before
oh
dear
me
how
perfectly
awful
you
i
mean
i
never
saw
such
boys
oh
my
my
mother
said
yes

interrupted
rachel
splashing
away
for
dear
life
well
now
we
must
hurry
and
get
these
dishes
done
and
then
we
can
go
out
and
play
said
ezekiel
departing
with
the
plate
he
was
drying
to
a
safe
distance
from
the
hot
shower
from
rachel
busy
fingers
yes
oh
my
what
fun
let
hurry
and
before
the
boys
quite
knew
how
the
dishes
were
all
piled
in
the
pantry
the
dishpan
and
mop
washed
out
and
hung
up
to
dry
and
the
crumbs
swept
from
the
kitchen
floor
there
said
rachel
smoothing
down
her
apron
in
great
satisfaction
now
we
can
go
out
come
on
i
going
to
the
corner
to
see
that
funeral
go
by
we
ca
said
peletiah
trying
his
best
to
hurry
after
her
mother
does
let
us
go
out
of
the
yard
when
she
away
and
beside
there
any
corner
the
road
just
goes
round
oh
bother
rachel
whirled
around
and
stamped
her
foot
impatiently
and
come
past
our
house
contributed
ezekiel
gaining
her
side
so
let
sit
on
the
doorstep
till
it
comes
and
you
can
tell
us
about
the
funerals
you
seen
in
the
city
suggested
peletiah
who
had
been
thinking
about
them
ever
since
all
right
said
rachel
seeing
she
was
not
to
lose
sight
of
the
parade
she
so
dearly
loved
whoopity
la
she
flung
herself
down
on
the
long
flat
doorstone
and
whipped
her
gown
neatly
away
on
either
side
i
to
sit
in
the
middle
the
boys
very
much
pleased
at
this
arrangement
which
they
would
never
have
thought
of
suggesting
sat
down
sedately
in
their
places
and
folded
their
hands
in
their
laps
now
tell
about
those
funerals
said
peletiah
well
let
me
think
said
rachel
reflecting
you
see
i
seen
so
many
hmm
oh
i
know
she
jumped
so
suddenly
that
she
came
near
precipitating
ezekiel
who
was
leaning
forward
to
attain
a
better
view
of
her
face
off
into
the
middle
of
the
peony
bed
take
care
rachel
twitched
him
back
into
his
place
yes

goin
to
tell
you
about
one
perfectly
splendid
funeral
i
see
just
you
must
say
corrected
peletiah
with
disapproval
he
was
fairly
longing
for
the
recital
but
it
would
never
do
to
let
such
a
slip
in
conversation
pass
well
what
shall
i
say
then
cried
rachel
pertly
and
not
at
all
pleased
at
the
interruption
you
must
say
i
did
saw
it

ca
saw
a

so
there
pel
pel
whatever
your
name

he
said
solemnly
peletiah
oh

rachel
put
her
face
between
her
two
hands
and
began
to
giggle
tell
about
the
funeral

ezekiel
twitching
her
sleeve
and
you
must
say
reiterated
peletiah
i
ca

ai

so
there
now
declared
rachel
bringing
up
her
head
and
setting
her
mouth
obstinately
then
i
ai
going
to
sit
here
said
peletiah
getting
off
from
the
because
my
mother
would
like
it
she
always
makes

cried
rachel
a
little
red
spot
coming
on
either
cheek

she
pele

she
yes

said
peletiah

peletiah
in
loud
disapproval
on
the
further
side
well
so
he
was
declared
rachel
turning
around
to
him
some
men

an
some
men
are
only
little
mean
ones
but
this
one
i
you
about

oh
an
awful
big
one
and
she
spread
her
arms
with
a
generous
sweep
to
indicate
his
importance
men
are
ever
bugs
said
peletiah
decidedly
oh
yes
they
are
no
they
ai
he
declared
obstinately
my
mother
says
we
must
contradict
put
in
ezekiel
with
a
reproving
glance
at
him
across
rachel
lap
peletiah
unfolded
his
hands
in
extreme
distress
but
he
could
say
that
men
were
bugs
so
he
sat
still
anyway
they
are
in
the
city
where
i
lived
said
rachel
so
never
mind
well
this
funeral
was
just
too
splendid
for
anythin
in
the
first
place
there
was
oh
it
coming
cried
ezekiel
pricking
up
his
ears
miss
funeral
coming
rachel
gave
a
jump
that
carried
her
off
from
the
and
quite
a
piece
down
the
path
she
was
hanging
over
the
gate
when
the
boys
came
up
where
she
said
i
do
see
any
a
small
black
wagon
went
by
the
old
horse
at
a
jog
trot
and
after
it
came
a
rockaway
and
after
that
a
carryall
and
around
the
curve
in
the
road
appeared
more
vehicles
of
the
same
patterns
tapering
off
to
a
line
of
chaises
and
gigs
why
that
the
funeral
said
peletiah
in
solemn
enjoyment
and
pointing
a
finger
at
it
it
going
by
now
what
exclaimed
rachel
horribly
disappointed
then
she
flew
away
from
the
gate
and
turned
her
back
on
it
all
i
wish
i
was
back
in
the
city
she
said
xiii
she
going
to
stay
here
forever
it
was
dreadful
and
after
she
had
said
it
rachel
stood
overwhelmed
with
distress
do
you
tell
your
father
she
whirled
around
and
clutched
peletiah
sleeve
we
must
he
said
he
the
minister
and
we
have
to
tell
him
everything
well
do
tell
your
mother

she
begged
anxiously
we
must
said
peletiah
again
because
we
tell
her
everything
too
then
she
send
me
back
rachel
quite
gone
in
despair
gave
a
loud
cry
and
threw
herself
face
downward
on
the
grass
where
she
sobbed
as
if
her
heart
would
break
this
was
so
much
worse
than
he
had
imagined
as
any
possible
effect
from
his
words
that
peletiah
could
speak
but
stood
over
her
in
silent
misery
seeing
this
ezekiel
took
matters
into
his
own
hands
i
going
to
run
after
the
funeral
and
get
ma
to
come
home
she
be
at
the
top
of
the
procession
and
he
moved
off
toward
the
gateway
stop
rachel
squealed
then
she
sprang
to
her
feet
do
you
stir
a
step
you
she
commanded
they
all
hearing
you
observed
peletiah
who
seeing
rachel
upon
her
feet
found
his
spirits
reviving
and
he
pointed
to
the
line
of
buggies
and
chaises
see
looking
back

father

rachel
pointing
to
the
departing
hearse
with
scorn
oh
oh
what
a
story
exclaimed
ezekiel
who
was
just
on
the
point
of
reproving
his
brother
for
contradicting
and
he
pointed
his
brown
finger
at
her
that
got
miss
bedlow
in
and
they

rachel
hastily
dismissing
miss

and

all

thereon
summarily
and
she
dug
the
toe
of
her
shoe
into
the
gravel
do
let
your
mother
send
me
back
you
said
you
wished

severely
fixing
his
pale
eyes
on

distressed
face

the
tears
were
making
little
paths
well
i

added
vindictively

in
her

over

rachel
shivering
again
oh

she
beat

dreadful
an
her
voice
broke

cried
peletiah
awful
said
rachel
cramming
her
fingers
into
her
mouth
to
keep
from
crying
oh
dear

send
me
back
peletiah
took
two
or
three
steps
off
then
came
back

shake

if
you
want
to
he
said
generously
and
you
ai
going
back
well

said
ezekiel
stoutly
and
my
ma
will

she
shakes
me
so
there
i
hai

said
rachel
disclosing
her
black
eyes
between
her
fingers
and
viewing
him
with
cold
disdain
well

to
repeated
ezekiel
with
decision
her
gran
beat
her
peletiah
went
over
to
his
brother
she
beat
rachel
he
kept
repeating
it
over
and
over
meanwhile
ezekiel
moved
about
in
confusion
digging
the
toes
of
his
shoes
into
the
gravel
to
hide
it
well
she
ai
going
to
shake
me
he
said
but
it
was
in
a
fainter
voice
and
he
did
look
at
rachel
eyes
and
you
must
ask
mother
to
send
her
back
said
peletiah
stubbornly
she
ai
going
to
shake
me
it
was
now
so
low
that
scarcely
any
one
could
hear
it
and
you
must
ask
mother
to
send
her
back
said
peletiah
again
going
to
stay
here
just
for
ever
and
ever
there
was
something
in
his
tone
that
made
ezekiel
hasten
to
say
oh
i
wo
and
i
wo
shake
you
said
rachel
flying
out
from
behind
her
hands
and
up
to
him
if
you
only
let
me
stay
here
just
let
me
stay
she
cried
hungrily
well
said
ezekiel
with
a
great
deal
of
condescension
if
you
shake
me
you
may
stay
at
our
house
so
the
children
went
back
to
the
flat
to
talk
it
over
peletiah
saying
maybe
you
can
go
to
school
with
us
next
fall
oh
my
exclaimed
rachel
with
wide
eyes
and
clasping
her
hands
got
to
learn
a
lot
first
yes
my
father
got
to
teach
you
first
said
peletiah
where
he
going
to
do
it
rachel
leaned
over
to
get
a
comprehensive
view
of
his
face
in
his
study
answered
peletiah
where
that
that
where
he
writes
his
sermons
in
that
he
preaches
at
people
sundays
said
ezekiel
finding
it
very
pleasant
to
be
communicative
now
that
he
was
quite
sure
the
new
girl
would
not
shake
him
oh
how
nice
breathed
rachel
that
scrumptious
that
what
asked
peletiah
critically
scrumptious
have
you
ever
heard
that
oh
what
a
nin
i
mean
oh
how
funny
and
it
ai
nice
at
all
to
have
my
father
teach
you
said
peletiah
with
very
doleful
ideas
of
that
study
why
asked
rachel
with
gathering
dread
oh
he
makes
you
learn
things
said
peletiah
dismally
drawing
a
long
sigh
at
the
remembrance
but
that
just
what
i
want
to
do
cried
rachel
with
sparkling
eyes
i
goin
to
learn
an
learn
till
i
ca
learn
no
more
peletiah
was
so
occupied
in
edging
off
from
her
that
he
forgot
to
correct
her
speech
yes
i
goin
to
learn
exclaimed
rachel
in
a
glad
little
shout
and
springing
to
her
feet
she
swung
her
arms
over
her
head
i
goin
to
read
an
i
goin
to
write
an
then
i
can
write
a
letter
to
my
phronsie
she
ended
up
with
a
cheese
plunging
down
on
the
grass
and
puffing
out
her
gown
like
a
small
balloon
you
ca
do
that
she
said
nodding
triumphantly
up
at
the
two
boys
i
do
want
to
said
peletiah
sitting
still
on
the
well
you
ca
anyway
you
have
got
a
frock
well
now
play
and
she
hopped
to
her
feet
come
on
what
it
be
i
show
you
the
brook
volunteered
ezekiel
getting
up
what
a
brook
asked
rachel
hoh
hoh
ezekiel
really
laughed
it
was
so
funny
she
does
know
what
a
brook
is
he
said
and
he
laughed
again
well
what
is
it
demanded
rachel
laughing
it
water
i
do
want
to
see
any
water
said
rachel
turning
off
disdainfully
there
nothing
pretty
in
that
but
it
awfully
pretty
said
peletiah
it
runs
all
down
over
the
stones
and
under
the
trees
and
where
is
it
cried
rachel
running
up
to
him
in
great
excitement
oh
take
me
to
it
it
just
back
of
the
house
said
ezekiel
i
show
you
the
way
but
rachel
once
directed
got
there
first
and
was
down
on
her
knees
on
the
bank
dabbling
her
hands
in
the
purling
little
stream
half
wild
with
delight
and
when
the
parson
and
his
wife
got
home
from
miss
bedlow
funeral
they
found
the
three
children
there
perfectly
absorbed
in
the
labor
of
sailing
boats
of
cabbage
leaves
and
guiding
their
uncertain
craft
in
and
out
the
shimmering
pools
and
down
through
the
tiny
rapids
and
they
watched
them
unobserved
but
i
dread
when
i
give
her
the
first
lesson
said
the
parson
as
they
stood
unperceived
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
everything
else
is
a
splendid
success
let
us
hope
the
lessons
will
be
too
husband
said
henderson
a
happy
light
in
her
eyes
i
hope
so
but
i
afraid
the
child
is
all
for
play
and
will
be
hard
to
teach
he
said
with
a
sigh
but
on
the
morrow
well
the
minister
came
out
of
his
study
when
the
lesson
hour
was
over
with
a
flush
on
his
face
that
betokened
pleasure
as
well
as
hard
work
and
rachel
began
to
skip
around
for
very
joy
she
was
really
to
be
a
little
student
henderson
had
said
not
that
rachel
really
knew
what
that
meant
exactly
but
the
master
was
pleased
and
that
was
enough
and
all
of
a
sudden
when
she
was
putting
up
some
dishes
in
the
closet
she
began
to
sing
henderson
nearly
dropped
the
dish
she
was
wiping
why
my
child
she
exclaimed
then
stopped
but
rachel
did
hear
her
and
sang
on
it
was
a
wild
little
thing
that
she
had
heard
from
the
hand
organs
and
the
people
singing
it
in
the
streets
of
the
big
city
just
then
old
miss
parrott
stately
ancestral
coach
drove
up
the
parson
wife
hurried
to
the
front
door
which
was
seldom
opened
except
for
special
company
like
the
present
i
heard
said
miss
parrott
as
henderson
ushered
her
in
that
taken
a
little
girl
out
of
charity
and
i
want
to
see
you
and
your
husband
about
it
will
you
come
into
his
study
then
said
henderson
husband
has
gone
out
to
work
in
his
garden
and
i
will
call
him
in
miss
parrott
stepped
into
the
apartment
in
stately
fashion
her
black
silk
gown
crackling
pleasantly
as
she
walked
and
seated
herself
very
primly
as
befitted
her
ancestry
and
in
one
of
the
stiff
chairs
and
presently
the
parson
his
garden
clothes
off
and
his
best
coat
on
came
in
hurriedly
to
know
his
honored
parishioner
bidding
i
will
come
to
the
point
at
once
said
miss
parrott
with
dignified
precision
as
he
sat
beside
her
and
she
drew
herself
up
stiffer
yet
in
the
pleasing
confidence
that
what
she
was
about
to
say
would
strike
both
of
her
hearers
as
the
most
proper
thing
to
do
you
have
taken
this
little
girl
i
hear
to
educate
and
bring
up
for
a
time
said
the
minister
hurriedly
very
true
for
a
period
of
time
said
miss
parrott
throwing
her
lace
veil
worn
by
her
mother
before
her
away
from
her
face
well
now
pastor
it
is
not
appropriate
for
you
to
do
this
work
with
your
hands
already
overburdened
neither
should
you
bear
the
expense
but
i
do
cried
parson
henderson
guilty
now
of
interrupting
king
pays
me
and
well
for
teaching
the
little
girl
until
she
will
be
ready
for
the
district
school
you
see
she
has
never
been
in
a
schoolroom
in
her
life
and
it
would
be
cruel
to
put
her
with
children
of
her
own
age
when
she
is
so
ignorant
but
she
is
singularly
bright
and
i
have
the
greatest
hopes
of
her
madam
for
she
is
far
above
and
beyond
most
children
in
many
ways
but
miss
parrott
had
come
to
hear
all
this
so
she
gave
a
stately
bow
no
doubt
pastor
but
i
must
say
what
is
on
my
mind
it
is
that
i
have
for
some
time
wanted
to
do
a
bit
of
charity
like
this
and
providence
now
seems
to
point
the
way
for
it
i
would
like
to
take
the
child
and
do
for
her
let
her
come
to
you
here
for
lessons
but
let
me
bring
her
up
in
my
house
there
was
an
awful
pause
parson
henderson
looked
at
his
wife
but
said
never
a
word
helplessly
leaving
it
to
her
dear
miss
parrott
said
henderson
and
she
so
far
forgot
her
fear
of
the
stately
reserved
parishioner
as
to
lay
her
hand
on
the
one
of
the
visitor
we
were
given
the
care
of
the
child
by
king
who
rescued
her
from
her
terrible
surroundings
and
we
could
possibly
surrender
this
charge
to
another
but
i
will
tell
you
what
we
might
do
husband
and
her
eyes
sought
his
face
rachel
might
go
down
now
and
then
to
spend
the
day
with
miss
parrott
oh
your
beautiful
house
she
broke
off
like
a
child
in
her
enthusiasm
i
do
so
want
her
to
be
in
it
sometimes
she
turned
suddenly
to
the
visitor
miss
parrott
old
face
glowed
and
a
smile
lingered
among
the
wrinkles
and
she
must
pass
the
night
occasionally
she
said
there
was
a
world
of
entreaty
in
her
eyes
i
think
so
said
henderson
but
we
must
leave
that
to
rachel
and
rachel
in
the
closet
was
trilling
up
and
down
some
of
the
jigs
her
feet
had
kept
time
to
when
she
with
the
other
children
had
run
out
to
dance
on
the
corner
when
the
organ
man
came
round
all
unconscious
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
study
what
that
cried
miss
parrott
starting
the
conference
was
over
and
she
was
coming
out
of
the
pastor
study
to
get
into
her
ancestral
carriage
that
rachel
singing
said
henderson
old
miss
parrott
gasped
why
my
dear
pastor
and
henderson
can
the
child
sing
like
that
this
is
the
first
time
she
has
tried
it
said
the
parson
who
had
no
ear
for
music
and
was
sorely
tried
when
expected
to
admire
any
specimens
of
it
but
i
dare
say
she
will
do
very
well
she
is
a
very

more
than
a
generation
in
the

if

sure
of

and
he
shifted
his
feet
in
impatience
i
do

in
the
least
where
joel
is
said
polly
pausing
in
her
run
through
the
hall
she
had
promised
alexia
to
be
over
at
her
house
at
nine
and
there
it
was
the
big
clock
in
the
corner
stated
plainly
five
minutes
of
that
hour
oh
dear
me
i
wish
i
could
help
you
and
she
wrinkled
up
her
brows
in
distress
frick
sat
down
on
one
of
the
big
carved
chairs
and
fairly
whined
i
chased
and
chased
all
about
here
and
no
one
knows
where
joel
is
polly
do
find
him
for
me
and
he
began
to
sniffle
oh
i
ca
began
polly
impatiently
then
she
finished
dear
me
why
i
do
know
in
the
very
least
where
joel
is
frick
not
the
leastest
bit
in
the
world
oh

him
said
frick
sniffling
dreadfully
and
beginning
to
wheedle
and
beg
do
polly
he
seized
her
gown
the
boys
ca
do
anything
without
joel
and
they
sent
me
for
him
and
i
sure
i
ca
do
anything
polly
shook
her
gown
free
so
no
use
in
asking
me
to
stand
here
and
talk
about
it
frick
mason
and
just
look
at
that
clock
two
minutes
of
nine
she
pointed
tragically
up
to
the
big
clock
and
i
promised
to
be
at
alexia
the
last
words
came
back
to
him
as
she
disappeared
out
to
the
veranda
and
down
the
steps
racing
off
as
hard
as
she
could
frick
got
off
from
his
chair
took
three
or
four
steps
hopelessly
then
stiffened
up
i
going
to
find
him
he
announced
to
himself
and
turning
down
the
angle
he
knocked
at
the
first
door
on
the
left
hullo
exclaimed
joel
unlocking
the
door
and
opening
it
oh
you
here
frick
seized
him
on
both
sides
wishing
he
had
twice
the
number
of
hands
to
employ
then
he
tried
to
run
in
but
joel
shook
off
the
grasp
pushed
to
the
door
only
leaving
the
scantiest
space
to
allow
of
conversation
you
ca
come
in
he
said
steadily
hold
on
do
shut
the
door
cried
frick
pressing
up
closely
and
still
endeavoring
to
get
a
good
grasp
on
some
of
joel
clothing
ow
you
smashed
my
nose
joel
pepper
you
must
take
your
nose

joel
decidedly
for

going
to
shut
the
door
if

so
well
let
me
come
in
said
frick
struggling
violently
say
joel
shut
the
door
for
answer
joel
slammed
to
the
door
and
the
key
clicked
in
the
lock
i
said
i
do
it
if
you
scrouged
and
pushed
and
i
must
he
answered
with
the
air
of
a
man
performing
his
duty
this
is
my
and
you
must
come
in
frick
mason
frick
slid
down
to
the
floor
and
laid
his
mouth
alongside
the
crack
with
the
feeling
that
his
message
would
be
more
impressive
delivered
in
that
way
since
he
was
not
to
be
admitted
to
the
apartment
to
give
it
in
due
form
the
boys
want
you
joel
they
all
waiting
for
us
outside
hurry
up
having
delivered
it
frick
got
up
to
his
feet
in
a
hurry
confident
that
the
door
would
be
flung
wide
to
let
joel
come
hopping
out
in
delight
and
not
choosing
to
be
run
over
in
the
process
ca
go
said
joel
in
muffled
accents
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
what
roared
frick
not
believing
his
ears
ca
go
repeated
joel
go
right
away
from
this
door
what
did
you

frick
slid
to
the
floor
again
and
beat
his
hands
on
the
polished
surface
say
joel
we
want
you
to
come
we
all
waiting
for
you
do
you
understand
he
kept
saying
it
over
and
over
under
the
impression
that
if
he
only
repeated
it
enough
the
door
would
open
and
i
say
i
ca
go
declared
joel
in
a
high
wrathful
key
if
you
do
go
away
and
let
this
door
alone
i
come
out
and
pound
you
we
going
to
the
pond
said
frick
exactly
as
if
responding
to
the
most
cordial
request
to
furnish
the
plan
we
got
larry
boat
and
webb
is
going
to
take
his
father
and
ow
go

roared
joel
in
an
awful
voice
and
we
going
to
take
our
luncheon
and
stop
at
egg
rock
and
the
door
flew
open
wildly
and
joel
leaped
out
over
frick
flattened
on
the
floor
did
i
tell
you
to
let
me
alone
cried
joel
on
top
of
the
messenger
and
pommeling
away
briskly
say
did
i
tell
say
did
i
tell
you
the
noise
all
this
made
was
sufficient
to
bring
jane
who
did
stop
to
drop
her
broom
my
goodness
me
master
joel
she
said
running
down
from
the
what

joel
cheerfully
and
not
looking
up
well
you
stop

this
minute
commanded
jane
waving
her
broom
over
the
two
figures
for
by
this
time
frick
had
managed
to
roll
over
and
was
now
putting
up
quite
a
vigorous
little
fight
in
his
own
defense
i
ca
said
joel
i
promised
him
oh
dear
me
cried
jane
bringing
her
broom
down
smartly
on
as
much
of
the
surface
of
either
boy
as
was
possible
i
scream
for
fisher
if
you
do
stop
you
two
boys
i
will
as
true
as
anything
oh
no
you
must
jane
said
joel
his
brown
fists
wavered
in
the
air
and
described
several
circles
before
they
fell
at
his
side
seeing
which
frick
slipped
out
from
underneath
him
and
began
to
belabor
joel
to
his
heart
content
you
must
jane
howled
joel

cried
say

quite
bloody
and
a
dab
here
and
there
on
his
countenance

him
anything
but
a
pleasing
expression
ugh
cried
jane
with
a
little
shiver
you
boys

right
straight
up
from
this
floor
or

tell
mrs
fisher
joel
seized
her
apron
string
and
howled
jane

jane

away
the
string
for
such
carryings
on
i
never

he
take
care
of
you
both
and
she
skipped
upstairs
broom
and
all
it
was
useless
to
try
to
slip
away
unperceived
for
old
king
bore
down
upon
them
along
the
hall
in
his
stateliest
fashion
dear
me
what
have
we
here
as
both
boys
slunk
down
as
small
as
possible
why
joel
it
was
impossible
to
convey
greater
astonishment
in
his
tone
i
thought
you
were
steady
at
work
so
i
was
cried
joel
stung
to
the
quick
and
jumping
to
his
feet
he
fairly
beat
the
old
gentleman
arm
with
two
distressed
little
palms
and
he
made
me
come
out
i
said
i
would
pound
him
and
i
had
to
oh
grandpapa
i
had
to
and
he
pranced
wildly
around
the
tall
stately
figure
keep
quiet
joe
said
the
old
gentleman
with
a
restraining
hand
and
frick
get
up
oh
dear
me
as
frick
obeyed
bringing
his
interesting
countenance
to
view
by
no
means
improved
by
his
efforts
to
wipe
off
the
smears
what
have
you
boys
been
about
he
would
come
out
said
frick
rubbing
violently
all
over
his
round
cheeks
and
the
boys
sent
me
for
him
and
they
waiting
now
he
finished
with
a
very
injured
air
eh
oh
and
so
they
sent
you
for
joel
said
the
old
gentleman
a
light
breaking
over
his
face
yes
sir
said
frick
with
a
final
polish
to
his
countenance
on
the
cuff
of
his
jacket
sleeve
and
wo
you
please
make
joel
hurry
up
and
come
out
sir
we
waited
so
long
and
is
that
the
way
you
respond
to
your
invitations
my
boy
said
grandpapa
with
a
grim
smile
i
should
think
you
receive
many
at
this
rate
so
you
fell
upon
him
because
he
asked
you
to
go
somewhere
eh
with
a
keen
glance
into
the
black
eyes
no
sir
said
joel
but
he
would
go
away
and
i
told
him
if
he
did
i
come
out
and
pound
him
so
i
had
to
um
now

said
the
old
gentleman
reflecting
a
bit
so
you
kept
on
at
the
door
eh
frick
yes
sir
said
frick
giving
up
his
countenance
as
a
bad
job
i
had
to
the
boys

waiting
you
see
sir
wo
you
please
make
joe
hurry
up
and

out
and
tell
those
boys
that
when
joel
gets
ready
to
join
them
he
make
his
appearance
frick
grandpapa
waved
him
off
sociably
and
frick
not
exactly
understanding
how
or
why
found
himself
on
the
other
side
of
the
big
front
door
in
the
midst
of
the
waiting
company
from
which
he
had
been
picked
out
as
messenger
i
would
make
such
a
promise
again
if
i
were
you
joel
observed
old
king
gathering
up
the
small
brown
hand
in
one
of
his
own
it
might
be
a
little
awkward
to
keep
it
you
know
now
then
here
we
are
turning
in
at
the
well
say
no
more
but
fly
at
your
task
and
he
seated
himself
in
the
big
chair
before
the
and
took
up
his
pen
thus
left
to
himself
joel
went
slowly
over
to
the
set
of
shelves
in
the
alcove
from
which
frick
summons
at
the
door
had
called
him
there
were
several
volumes
on
the
floor
and
a
blank
book
and
some
sheets
of
paper
showing
clearly
joe
favorite
method
of
setting
to
work
on
making
lists
while
sprawled
on
the
carpet
with
all
his
paraphernalia
around
him
he
threw
himself
down
amongst
it
all
prowled
around
for
his
pencil
which
suddenly
dropped
when
he
had
deserted
his
task
had
taken
the
opportunity
to
roll
off
by
itself
now
it
added
to
his
discomfiture
by
hiding
plague
take
it
he
scowled
a
black
little
frown
settling
on
his
brow
where
is
it
prowling
around
frantically
on
the
carpet
with
hasty
hands
what
is
it
joe
old
king
though
apparently
very
busy
over
at
the
seemed
to
be
quite
well
aware
of
everything
that
went
on
in
the
alcove
i
lost
my
pencil
announced
joe
in
a
dismal
voice
oh
well
that
not
so
bad
as
it
might
be
said
the
old
gentleman
come
over
and
get
another
and
by
and
by
you
can
find
your
own
joel
advanced
to
the
and
put
out
a
hand
for
the
pencil
which
the
old
gentleman
laid
within
it
but
not
before
he
had
taken
a
good
look
at
the
chubby
face
above
it
so
frick
and
the
boys
wanted
you
eh
asked
grandpapa
carelessly
going
somewhere
maybe
yes
said
joel
not
looking
up
they
are
going
to
the
pond
oh
really
said
old
king
and
you
said
no
eh
joel
yes
said
joel
i
suppose
you
did
want
to
go
eh
joel
said
the
old
gentleman
carelessly
and
playing
with
his
paper
knife
joel
black
eyes
flew
wide
open
and
he
raised
his
head
to
stare
into
grandpapa
face
oh
yes
i
did
awfully
then
why
did
you
go
asked
grandpapa
just
as
carelessly
and
giving
the
paper
knife
an
extra
twirl
or
two
joel
took
his
gaze
off
to
regard
the
pile
of
books
over
on
the
alcove
floor
oh
your
work
is
that
it
joel
asked
the
old
gentleman
so
you
thought
you
rather
stay
and
finish
your
hour
on
it
eh
my
boy
joel
squirmed
uneasily
i
had
rather
he
said
at
last
but
i
got
to
eh
said
old
king
i
said
i
work
an
hour
and
not
stop
said
joel
as
something
seemed
to
be
required
of
him
the
old
gentleman
waiting
for
him
to
finish
you
mean
you
made
the
bargain
to
do
this
work
and
you
could
back
out
said
grandpapa
joel
looked
up
and
nodded
quickly
yes
sir
oh
yes
well
now
i
must
hinder
you
from
your
work
old
king
turned
briskly
to
his
writing
again
or
i
shall
be
as
bad
as
frick
eh
joel
and
he
laughed
gayly
now
trot
back
and
go
at
your
task
again
so
joel
fortified
with
his
pencil
marched
back
to
sit
on
the
floor
in
the
alcove
and
take
up
his
interrupted
work
and
grandpapa
pen
went
scratching
busily
over
the
paper
and
nothing
else
was
heard
except
the
buzzing
of
a
big
fly
outside
the
window
venting
his
vexation
at
his
inability
to
get
in
meanwhile
frick
and
the
knot
of
boys
had
drawn
off
in
astonishment
and
dismay
at
the
failure
of
their
plan
to
get
joel
pepper
into
the
delightful
expedition
what
was
he
doing
demanded
more
than
one
boy
i
do
know
said
frick
i
could
get
in
oh
now
i
know
he
got
some
secret
said
larry
keep
and
he
whirled
around
in
vexation
and
snapped
his
fingers
maybe
it
a
suggested
another
boy
phoo
he
could
make
that
in
his
grandfather
said
larry
in
derision
yet
he
looked
anxious
suppose
joel
pepper
were
really
busy
over
such
a
splendid
thing
as
that
and
had
told
him
guess
something
else
i
ca
think
what
it
is
said
frick
sitting
down
on
the
curbstone
to
become
lost
in
thought
an
example
to
be
speedily
followed
by
all
the
boys
till
finally
there
was
a
dismal
row
of
them
without
a
thought
remaining
of
having
the
expedition
on
the
pond
since
joel
pepper
would
come
with
them
xv
up
in
alexia
pretty
room
polly

having
a
bad
with
herself
despite
all
the
attractions
up
in
alexia
pretty
room
it
no
use
she
cried
throwing
down
the
little
brush
with
which
she
was
whisking
off
the
dainty
the
girls
were
setting
up
the
various
adornments
that
were
plentifully
strewn
about
an
occupation
that
polly
dearly
loved
and
that
alexia
as
dearly
hated
i
must
go
home
alexia
down
on
her
knees
with
her
head
in
the
closet
grumbling
over
the
shoe
bag
whose
contents
were
in
a
chronic
state
of
overflow
pulled
it
out
suddenly
why
polly
pepper
she
exclaimed
in
an
injured
tone
one
eye
was
draped
by
a
cobweb
gained
by
diving
into
the
closet
extreme
corner
after
a
missing
slipper
gone
for
some
weeks
and
in
other
ways
alexia
face
presented
a
very
unprepossessing
appearance
you
said
you
help
me
with
my
room
this
morning
oh
yes

polly
hurriedly
and
running
over
to

something

my
mind
oh
dear
me
alexia
hopped
up
to
her
feet

slipper
flying
off
at
a
tangent
and
ran
all
around
polly
pepper
gazing
at
her
anxiously
i
do
see
anything
oh
what
is
it
she
cried
you
see
the
boys
wanted
to
find
joel
and
i
began
polly
twisting
her
fingers
bother
the
boys
exclaimed
alexia
interrupting

that
all
they
are
everlastingly
wanting
to
find

sigh
of
relief

must
say
polly
you

to
death
oh

this
old
closet
when
she
does
the
room
it
dirty
as
can
be
if
aunt
knew
it
the
rest
of
it
was
lost
as
alexia
was
down
on
her
knees
again
her
head
back
in
the
closet
with
the
hope
of
unearthing
more
slippers
and
shoes
alexia
do
come
out
cried
polly
pulling
her
gown
smartly
i
must
speak
to
you
ca
said
alexia
rummaging
away
there
i
gone
and
knocked
down
my
blue
silk
waist
do
pick
it
up
polly
it
get
all
dirt
and
then
aunt
scold
as
if
to
make
matters
worse
a
voice
out
in
the
hall
was
heard
misery
me
cried
alexia
scuffling
out
backward
from
the
closet
the
blue
silk
waist
on
her
head
where
it
had
fallen
and
in
her
sudden
exit
nearly
overthrowing
polly
pepper
here
comes
aunt
shut
the
door
polly
shut
it
scrambling
with
both
hands
to
get
the
waist
off
while
a
hook
caught
in
her
light
fluffy
hair
and
miss
rhys
being
too
near
the
door
for
any
such
protection
as
alexia
suggested
in
she
walked
what
in
the
world
she
lifted
both
hands
alexia
rhys
is
it
possible
i
concluded
not
to
go
and
came
back
and
to
think
of
this
playing
with
your
best
silk
waist
i
not
playing
declared
alexia
in
a
sharp
key
tossing
back
from
her
head
as
much
of
the
waist
as
she
could
and
it
hurts
awfully
twitching
angrily
at
the
hook
polly
sprang
to
her
assistance
wait
a
minute
and
i
get
you
out
she
said
and
i
wo
wait
cried
alexia
loudly
it
bad
enough
to
be
hooked
to
death
with
a
horrid
old
ugly
waist
without
being
scolded
to
pieces
by
your
aunt
oh
alexia
exclaimed
miss
rhys
to
call
that
beautiful
waist
an
ugly
thing
and
i
pull
every
spear
of
hair
out
of
my
head
but
i
get
the
thing
off
ow
as
she
began
to
put
her
threat
into
execution
do
be
still
alexia
begged
polly
trying
to
push
aside
the
nervous
fingers
i
wo
be
still
cried
alexia
casting
up
a
pale
eye
full
of
wrath
on
the
side
next
to
polly
and
giving
another
twitch
i
guess
if
you
been
hooked
up
by
a
horrible
old
thing
and
your
aunt
came
in
and
scolded
you
terribly
you
would
wait
ow
oh
dear
me
then
said
polly
standing
quite
still
since
you
wo
let
me
help
you
i
going
home
alexia
oh
do
cried
alexia
and
she
dropped
her
hands
to
her
side
in
a
flash
the
blue
silk
waist
dangling
to
her
head
by
its
hook
i
let
you
help
whatever
you
want
to
polly
she
mumbled
meekly
so
polly
set
to
work
miss
rhys
slipping
out
of
the
room
although
nervous
fingers
were
now
not
in
the
way
still
it
was
easy
to
disentangle
the
hook
from
the
thick
fluffy
hair
wound
in
as
it
was
you
tangled
it
all
up
said
polly
bending
over
it
with
flushed
face
her
fingers
working
busily
and
it
all
in
a
snarl
dear
me
do
i
hurt
no
never
mind
said
alexia
is
any
matter
do
go
home
polly
she
held
her
fast
by
the
gown
no
of
course
not
said
polly
at
least
not
until
i
get
this
hook
out
of
your
hair
there
oh
dear
me
i
thought
it
was
quite
free
well
anyway
now
it
is
she
held
up
the
blue
silk
waist
with
a
triumphant
little
flourish
over
her
own
head
it
must
be
awful
to
have
something
fastened
to
you
like
that
she
said
sympathetically
as
she
placed
the
waist
on
the
bed
with
a
sigh
of
relief
well
i
guess
you
think
so
assented
alexia
decidedly
it
too
perfectly
awful
for
anything
it
pulls
like
a
big
vulture
with
his
talons
holding
your
hair
she
hopped
to
her
feet
and
shook
herself
in
delight
her
long
light
braids
flying
out
gayly
well
i
am
glad
that
aunt
has
gone
looking
around
the
room
and
drawing
a
long
breath
polly
pepper
stood
quite
still
over
by
the
bed
well

alexia
dancing
over
to
seize
her
arm
let
have
a
spin
but

alexia
with
another
tug
at
her
arm

alexia
dropping

about
here
and
there
trying
to
get
things
in
their
places
but
knocking
down
more
than

tidied
up
why

she
cried
impatiently
whirling
around
because
i
nothing
to

replied
polly
not
moving
oh

me
alexia
sent
her
long
arms
out
with
a
despairing
gesture
i
suppose

to
go
and
tell
aunt

sorry

a
long
breath
but
i

together
they

alexia
on
the
way
i

a
big
hug
mamsie

grandpapa
she
cried
hastily

alexia
but
she
was
highly
gratified
at
every
repetition
of
the
invitation
well
oh
dear
me
as
they
stood
before
miss
rhys
door
that
lady
sat
in
her
bay
window
her
fingers
busy
with
her
embroidery
and
her
mind
completely
filled
with
plans
for
another
piece
when
that
particular
one
should
be
completed
i

alexia
plunging
up
to
the
chair
and
keeping
tight
hold
of

with
a
comfortable
wriggle
of
her
long
figure

miss
rhys
turning
back
to
her
embroidery

and
alexia
your

so
untidy
when
i
talk

alexia
drawing
off
and
pulling
polly
along
now

as

two
girls

safe
once
more
in

with
a
giggle

at
this
horrid
old
room

ran
by
the
window

the
word
boys
polly
ran
too
and
peeped
over
her
shoulder
oh
i
must

to
frick
and
without
more
warning
she
raced
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
front
stairs
polly
polly
pepper
but
polly
being
out
in
the
street
and
nearly
up
to
the
knot
of
boys
alexia
gave
up
calling
and
speedily
ran
after
her
to
hear
her
say
oh
frick
i
go
and
try
to
find
joel
for
you
frick
disentangled
himself
from
the
group
i
found
joel
myself
he
said
and
he
would
come
would
come
where
demanded
alexia
breathlessly
plunging
up
out
on
the
pond
it
was
larry
keep
who
answered
and
so
we
given
it
all
up
said
another
boy
very
dismally
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
alexia
how
tiresome
of
joel
oh
no
no
protested
polly
shaking
her
head
i
know
joel
could
go
or
else
he
would
you
know
that
boys
she
said
looking
anxiously
at
them
all
he
always
been
before
said
larry
in
a
dudgeon
and
i
do
see
what
makes
him
act
so
now
well
you
have
any
right
to
abuse
him
just
because
he
does
want
to
go
out
with
you
on
the
pond
said
alexia
warmly
veering
round
at
the
first
word
of
blame
of
joel
from
anybody
else
that
a
great
way
to
do
i
must
say
and
boys
you
know
joel
would
have
gone
if
he
could
do
you
said
polly
again
the
little
anxious
pucker
deepening
on
her
forehead
ye
es
said
larry
slowly
digging
the
toe
of
his
tennis
shoe
into
the
ground
as
no
one
else
said
anything
oh
he
would
he
would
said
polly
clasping
her
hands
tightly
together
the
color
flying
over
her
cheek
something
must
have
happened
to
keep
him
back
as
the
boys
having
nothing
more
to
say
moved
off
alexia
now
i
go
home
for
i
afraid
of
what
she
did
say
i
go
too
said
alexia
springing
after
her
wild
to
find
out
what
the
matter
could
be
with
joel
pepper
to
keep
him
from
one
of
his
favorite
sports
on
the
pond
there
is
anything
the
matter
with
him
shouted
back
frick
over
his
shoulder
who
had
caught
polly
last
words
and
he
could
have
gone
as
easy
as
not
he
was
in
king
with
the
door
locked
grandpapa
with
the
door
locked
repeated
polly
turning
around
in
a
puzzled
way
why
i
do
see
oh
then
she
gave
such
a
squeal
that
alexia
hopped
across
the
road
in
astonishment
i
know
now
dear
splendid
old
joel
boys
she
was
up
by
them
again
and
talking
so
fast
that
nobody
understood
for
a
moment
or
two
what
the
whole
thing
was
about
for
pity
sake
polly
pepper
alexia
was
shaking
her
arm
the
boys
crowding
around
polly
and
hanging
on
every
word
do
you
understand
oh
how
stupid
i
been
not
to
think
of
it
before
though
i
did
know
he
was
to
begin
this
very
morning
cried
polly
hurrying
on
all
in
a
glow
grandpapa
has
engaged
joel
to
do
some
work
for
him
on
his
books
polly
did
think
she
ought
to
explain
any
further
about
the
note
and
so
joel
thought
he
could
stop
till
the
hour
was
up
and
has
he
got
to
work
an
hour
on
at
a
time
interrupted
larry
in
amazement
pushing
his
way
nearer
to
polly
yes
said
polly
turning
her
rosy
face
on
him
so
glad
that
she
was
really
making
them
see
that
joel
could
go
with
them
when
he
was
asked
he
must
work
a
whole
hour
at
a
time
on
them
so
you
see
he
really
had
to
stay
back
but
this
part
was
lost
on
the
whole
group
hi
hi
they
shouted
and
larry
flung
up
his
cap
well
if
that
so
we
go
back
and
get
him
now
the
hour
must
be
up
and
off
they
raced
flinging
up
a
cloud
of
dust
from
their
heels
whew
exclaimed
alexia
did
you
ever
see
such
perfectly
dreadful
boys
to
kick
up
such
a
dust
oh
dear
me
polly
pepper
when
she
came
out
of
her
sneezing
fit
polly
was
saying
again
oh
how
perfectly
stupid
i
am
alexia
but
her
eyes
shone
for
it
was
now
all
right
for
joel
with
the
boys
xvi
the
accident
but
the
boys
did
get
back
after
joel
not
just
then
a
big
tallyho
coach
in
swinging
around
a
corner
bore
down
upon
the
struggling
crowd
the
driver
halloing
and
the
horn
blowing
lustily
by
way
of
a
signal
to
clear
the
road
this
would
have
been
all
well
enough
and
easy
to
avoid
if
a
string
of
bicyclists
had
not
selected
that
very
identical
moment
to
appear
from
the
opposite
direction
and
larry
whose
uncle
was
in
the
procession
having
a
laudable
desire
to
see
him
and
make
his
relation
aware
of
the
fact
turned
waved
his
cap
and
his
arms
with
a
hi
there
uncle
jack
and
in
another
second
was
under
the
big
wheels
the
whole
merry
party
going
over
him
and
the
laughter
and
chat
still
filling
the
air
miss
mary
taylor
having
an
outside
seat
looked
over
quickly
hamilton
dyce
sitting
next
clambered
down
do
be
frightened
he
said
into
her
pale
face
half
a
dozen
men
were
on
the
ground
with
him
and
the
boys
swarmed
around
wildly
getting
in
everybody
way
the
bicyclists
not
catching
the
idea
of
any
accident
were
swiftly
coasting
down
the
hill
for
after
all
their
leader
had
suddenly
changed
his
mind
and
veered
off
just
before
reaching
the
scene
of
the
accident
help
me
down
said
miss
taylor
hoarsely
ugh
do
said
beth
cameron
with
a
shiver
poking
her
parasol
well
down
over
her
eyes
i
would
see
it
for
all
the
world
shivering
you
ca
do
any
good
better
not
said
dyce
looking
up
at
miss
taylor
but
miss
mary
continued
to
say
help
me
down
and
she
so
evidently
displayed
the
intention
of
getting
down
without
any
assistance
if
it
were
forthcoming
that
dyce
did
as
he
was
bidden
and
she
was
on
the
spot
by
the
time
that
larry
was
drawn
out
from
under
the
wheels
and
laid
on
the
roadside
grass
i
afraid
he
done
for
poor
beggar
said
one
of
the
men
dyce
turned
miss
mary
completely
around
and
marched
her
off
to
the
middle
of
the
road
before
she
knew
that
such
summary
treatment
was
to
be
accorded
her
then
she
caught
her
breath
you
need
think
to
save
me
she
said
with
a
little
gasp
i
quite
strong
i
must
go
oh
do
stop
me
think
of
poor
mrs
keep
and
she
was
back
in
among
the
group
of
men
and
the
frantic
boys
send
for
doctor
fisher
she
cried
kneeling
down
by
larry
side
no
use
began
another
man
but
hamilton
dyce
cried
which
one
can
run
the
fastest
for
doctor
fisher
little
porter
knapp
could
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
all
arms
and
legs
was
he
and
able
to
get
over
more
ground
a
minute
than
any
other
boy
of
their
set
not
excepting
joel
pepper
so
before
dyce
had
finished
speaking
he
was
off
like
a
shot
leaving
miss
taylor
sitting
on
the
grass
holding
larry
poor
head
while
the
whole
crowd
of
men
revolved
around
her
nervous
to
do
something
but
not
seeing
their
way
clear
to
find
out
what
would
be
expedient
if
those
chaps
would
stop
howling
exclaimed
one
of
the
men
in
desperation
stalking
off
a
bit
to
cram
his
hands
in
his
pocket
and
ejaculate
this
to
a
companion
it
pretty
hard
on
the
kids
remarked
the
friend
with
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
frick
and
the
rest
of
the
boys
who
added
to
the
misery
by
crowding
up
to
the
scene
and
impeding
the
progress
of
all
helpers
he
dead
it
easy
to
see
observed
the
first
man
nodding
over
to
the
group
that
a
fact
it
looks
like
it
nodded
the
friend
well
it
a
bad
thing
but
no
one
at
fault
mac
could
help
it
the
little
beggar
ran
right
under
the
horses
oh
mac
not
to
blame
said
the
first
speaker
hastily
but
it
an
awful
calamity
just
the
same
to
run
down
a
kid
well
we
must
pacify
the
ladies
so
the
two
walked
back
and
up
to
the
side
of
the
coach
when
the
big
hats
under
the
parasols
leaned
over
and
allowed
their
fair
owners
to
be
diverted
with
all
sorts
of
comforting
things
and
presently
little
doctor
fisher
came
rushing
along
in
his
gig
out
of
which
sprang
porter
knapp
before
the
horse
could
be
persuaded
to
stop
illustration
oh
larry
said
miss
taylor
gently
bending
over
him
no
one
said
a
word
least
of
all
miss
taylor
except
the
doctor
who
ordered
them
to
right
and
to
left
as
assistants
and
before
long
larry
opened
his
blue
eyes
why
where
he
began
he
did
even
know
he
had
been
hurt
not
till
afterward
when
the
pain
and
suffering
set
in
easy
easy
there
said
little
doctor
fisher
great
scott
the
young
man
who
had
pronounced
him
dead
crammed
those
hands
of
his
deeper
yet
in
their
pockets
and
gave
a
whistle
oh
larry
said
miss
taylor
gently
bending
over
him
what
is
it
larry
tried
to
move
and
felt
a
strong
hand
laid
on
him
just
where
it
made
any
motion
impossible
beside
a
great
wave
of
pain
swept
him
suddenly
into
such
astonishment
as
well
as
suffering
that
all
he
could
do
was
to
shut
his
eyes
and
let
his
head
sink
back
now
then
doctor
fisher
glanced
up
to
the
all
of
you
get
down
he
said
curtly
and
before
the
women
quite
knew
how
the
pretty
gowns
and
hats
and
parasols
were
all
descending
a
gay
fluttering
bevy
all
chattering
together
miss
mary
i
trouble
you
to
hop
up
there
and
a
dozen
hands
helped
her
into
position
on
the
coach
now
then
dyce
and
you
he
nodded
over
to
harry
delafield
the
little
doctor
did
then
rapidly
picked
out
two
more
men
up
with
you
please
and
quicker
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
all
they
were
in
position
and
larry
had
been
lifted
gently
into
their
laps
his
head
on
miss
taylor
arm
ugh
betty
cameron
gave
a
worse
shiver
than
before
how
mary
taylor
can
she
exclaimed
with
a
grimace
oh
dear
me
i
as
faint
as
i
can
be
just
to
think
of
it
i
should
die
outright
to
be
up
there
with
him
well
we
got
to
walk
home
i
suppose
observed
one
of
the
other
girls
disconsolately
who
now
that
larry
could
really
speak
thought
it
quite
time
to
turn
attention
to
her
own
discomfort
and
she
thrust
out
her
dainty
shoe
the
boys
when
they
saw
that
larry
was
really
alive
stopped
howling
especially
as
each
and
all
had
felt
the
glare
of
the
eyes
back
of
doctor
fisher
big
spectacles
and
they
set
off
on
a
run
by
the
side
of
the
coach
and
as
far
ahead
of
that
vehicle
as
possible
as
mac
handled
the
ribbons
with
his
best
style
trying
to
drive
as
gently
as
possible
for
the
patient
to
his
home
of
course
said
the
little
doctor
turning
his
spectacles
up
to
mac
then
he
got
into
his
gig
whipped
up
and
took
the
lead
porter
knapp
went
across
streets
and
got
there
first
and
was
leaning
over
the
stone
gateway
when
the
little
doctor
gig
drove
up
eh
exclaimed
doctor
fisher
looking
at
him
over
his
glasses
well
you
have
a
pair
of
legs
joel
was
right
he
says
you
beat
everything
in
running
porter
looked
much
pleased
and
glanced
down
at
his
legs
affectionately
then
he
remembered
larry
and
sobered
at
once
doctor
fisher
while
going
up
the
steps
said
in
passing
larry
pull
through
all
right
i
think
she
here
cried
porter
suddenly
he
had
heard
the
words
but
something
had
abruptly
come
in
between
and
he
wildly
dashed
at
the
little
doctor
doctor
fisher
turned
around
and
saw
flourishing
up
to
the
gateway
a
gay
little
runabout
and
in
it
larry
mother
and
sister
my
goodness
he
was
down
by
its
side
and
off
in
the
distance
but
coming
surely
and
steadily
on
was
the
coach
bearing
larry
to
his
home
yes
yes
how
do
you
do
do
stop
cried
the
little
doctor
waving
his
hand
that
was
free
from
his
bag
of
instruments
go
on
to
the
stable
oh
no
i
stop
here
keep
had
her
foot
on
the
step
and
put
out
the
hand
not
occupied
with
her
flowing
draperies
eleanor
is
going
on
to
see
a
friend
well
how
do
you
do
you
had
better
drive
on
to
the
stable
said
the
little
doctor
both
of
you
this
time
he
had
such
an
imperative
manner
that
thoroughly
bewildered
keep
stepped
back
into
her
seat
and
motioned
eleanor
to
obey
is
he
awfully
funny
said
eleanor
turning
in
at
the
driveway
more
puzzled
if
possible
than
her
mother
yes
said
keep
he
is
but
then
i
suppose
he
has
a
good
deal
on
his
mind
you
know
they
say
his
practice
is
getting
to
be
tremendous
well
we
must
run
in
and
see
him
as
they
drove
down
to
the
stable
and
you
can
go
afterward
to
see
mary
taylor
illustration
yes
sir
called
joel
back
from
the
alcove
all
right
said
eleanor
and
one
of
the
stable
boys
coming
out
to
meet
the
pony
they
both
jumped
out
of
the
runabout
and
ran
up
the
back
veranda
steps
it
funny
he
did
come
down
this
way
if
he
wanted
us
to
drive
to
the
stable
cried
eleanor
mamma
do
say
you
think
it
queer
it
would
be
some
comfort
if
you
would
well
i
will
then
laughed
keep
and
there
stood
doctor
fisher
at
the
door
and
the
minute
she
saw
his
face
she
knew
that
something
dreadful
had
happened
well
joel
my
boy
old
king
who
had
been
consulting
his
watch
every
five
minutes
whirled
around
in
his
big
chair
time
to
lay
down
the
work
he
called
cheerily
yes
sir
called
joel
back
from
the
alcove
and
i
sure
if
ever
an
hour
was
long
this
last
one
has
been
the
old
gentleman
was
saying
to
himself
joel
who
was
rather
stiff
in
the
joints
when
first
getting
up
from
his
work
on
the
carpet
now
came
out
feeling
his
arms
and
then
indulging
in
a
good
long
stretch
it
seems
rather
good
eh
joe
to
swing
your
arms
cried
grandpapa
with
a
laugh
and
a
keen
glance
into
the
black
eyes
yes
declared
joel
with
another
stretch
and
wondering
if
ever
anything
was
so
good
in
this
world
as
to
be
told
the
hour
was
up
take
care
warned
the
old
gentleman
those
long
arms
of
yours
will
have
things
off
from
my
table
my
goodness
joe
you
must
really
go
out
of
doors
and
stretch
you
make
such
a
sweep
and
he
laughed
again
i
can
reach
so
far
joel
ran
all
around
the
table
and
stretched
out
his
brown
arms
see
grandpapa
he
cried
then
he
got
on
his
tiptoes
and
leaned
over
to
achieve
greater
and
more
astonishing
results
you
be
over
on
your
nose
if
i
do
rescue
you
and
the
things
on
my
table
said
king
bursting
into
a
heartier
laugh
than
ever
come
on
joey
my
boy
let
get
out
of
doors
in
a
larger
place
so
he
gathered
up
one
of
the
sprawling
sets
of
fingers
and
summarily
marched
him
out
now
i
suppose
the
next
thing
in
order
is
to
race
after
frick
and
those
boys
observed
old
king
when
the
garden
walk
was
attained
yes
sir
cried
joel
his
black
eyes
alight
and
his
feet
dancing
well
be
off
with
you
no
need
to
say
more
joel
heels
beat
the
hastiest
of
retreats
as
he
scuttled
off
at
the
liveliest
pace
of
which
he
was
capable
old
king
left
alone
nodded
to
himself
two
or
three
times
and
smiled
in
a
pleased
way
the
very
thing
he
said
at
last
and
in
as
great
satisfaction
as
if
he
had
been
talking
to
a
good
listener
xvii
joel
adventure
joel
rushed
along
at
a
breakneck
pace
to
make
up
for
lost
time
how
good
it
was
to
sniff
the
fresh
air
and
to
be
free
and
then
to
think
of
that
hour
put
into
solid
work
over
the
why
he
glowed
all
over
with
delight
at
the
very
thought
down
the
bank
of
spy
pond
into
one
of
the
curves
most
frequented
by
the
boys
of
his
set
he
ran
my
but
i
glad
to
get
here
though
hey
there
there
was
no
response
as
joel
dashed
into
what
the
boys
called
their
camp
a
rough
enclosure
the
wealthy
men
who
owned
the
pond
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
had
allowed
to
be
built
as
some
of
the
boys
were
their
own
sons
every
indulgence
in
the
way
of
using
the
pond
had
been
granted
and
horatio
king
being
the
largest
owner
and
the
most
indulgent
joel
set
to
a
boy
decided
to
call
it
the
king
camp
it
was
in
a
knot
of
pines
and
in
the
summer
was
a
most
attractive
place
overrun
with
vines
and
creepers
and
gay
with
the
colored
that
were
always
thrown
about
hey
there
shouted
joel
again
running
about
within
and
without
the
little
wooden
structure
are
you
all
deaf
hey
but
nobody
answered
save
a
little
bird
from
the
tip
of
the
tallest
tree
joel
stood
transfixed
with
amazement
then
he
dashed
off
suddenly
down
a
descent
to
the
little
cove
it
must
be
that
they
are
out
on
the
pond
he
said
to
himself
in
vexation
and
he
craned
his
neck
and
peered
up
and
down
the
shining
water
as
well
as
he
was
able
for
the
many
curves
but
i
see
how
they
can
be
for
larry
boat
is
here
he
had
dashed
up
again
to
the
camp
and
hersey
that
the
one
they
would
take
surveying
the
collection
of
rowboats
and
dories
drawn
up
on
the
beach
and
father
and
porter
knapp
besides
there
was
a
goodly
number
of
others
all
in
such
situations
as
by
no
means
suggested
a
party
expected
to
be
on
the
pond
at
short
notice
that
morning
well
i
going
out
anyway
declared
joel
snapping
his
fingers
and
catch
up
with
them
most
likely
they
taken
the
i
stop
for
that
so
pushing
off
his
he
picked
up
the
oars
and
headed
down
the
pond
in
the
direction
most
likely
in
his
mind
to
overtake
them
but
although
he
pulled
lustily
at
his
oars
and
ran
his
boat
in
and
out
the
curves
and
hallooed
and
shouted
he
did
catch
a
glimpse
of
them
and
the
pine
groves
and
wooded
glens
that
ran
down
to
the
curving
bank
only
echoed
his
own
calls
or
sent
a
bird
note
out
to
him
there
was
the
first
suggestion
of
a
boy
anywhere
about
where
in
the
world
are
they
cried
joel
in
vexation
resting
on
his
oars
hi
there
they
are
he
turned
suddenly
knocked
against
one
of
the
oars
it
slipped
and
before
he
knew
what
it
was
about
there
it
was
in
the
water
and
to
make
matters
worse
the
sound
that
had
filled
him
with
delight
proved
to
be
a
big
black
dog
scrambling
through
a
thicket
of
underbrush
and
coming
out
to
stare
at
him
from
the
edge
of
the
pond
oh
you
beggar
exclaimed
joel
not
to
the
dog
but
to
the
oar
drifting
off
quickly
it
was
an
easy
thing
however
so
he
thought
to
recover
it
and
he
made
no
special
haste
to
paddle
along
as
best
he
might
after
it
just
at
this
moment
another
boat
came
suddenly
in
sight
around
a
curve
it
did
hold
joel
friends
but
a
wholly
different
set
some
city
boys
who
had
no
rights
on
the
pond
and
having
stolen
their
opportunity
and
helped
themselves
to
a
boat
down
below
they
meant
to
have
as
good
a
time
as
possible
knowing
it
would
probably
be
their
last
so
here
was
a
grand
chance
a
boy
alone
in
a
rowboat
and
at
their
mercy
one
of
his
oars
drifting
off
hi
fellows
when
they
saw
it
they
yelled
with
glee
the
black
dog
on
the
bank
who
belonged
to
them
and
was
following
as
best
he
might
their
course
danced
about
and
gnashed
his
teeth
in
his
rage
that
he
could
join
actively
in
the
excitement
sniffing
at
the
water
and
drawing
back
as
it
lapped
his
feet
now
then
look
alive
cried
the
one
who
appeared
to
be
the
leader
and
the
whole
crew
bent
to
their
oars
with
a
right
good
will
and
grinning
all
over
their
faces
with
the
prospect
of
fun
ahead
they
made
straight
for
joel
in
his
boat
joel
drew
himself
up
his
black
eyes
flashing
and
paddled
with
all
his
might
but
it
was
no
use
his
boat
went
round
and
round
or
zigzagged
along
and
in
a
trice
the
unlucky
oar
was
seized
by
the
triumphant
crew
as
it
was
drifting
off
into
some
lily
pads
and
drawn
with
a
worse
yell
than
ever
into
their
boat
good
luck
here
would
be
easy
game
now
then
there
was
no
limit
to
their
delight
as
they
saluted
joel
in
every
conceivable
way
best
fitted
to
get
him
worked
up
how
are
you
snob
do
you
want
your
oar
and
such
things
every
boy
contributing
at
least
a
few
selections
to
the
general
hubbub
the
black
dog
on
the
bank
emitting
shrill
barks
of
distress
give
me
back
my
oar
roared
joel
sitting
very
straight
and
unconsciously
rolling
up
his
sleeves
hi
there
come
on
and
fight
if
you
want
to
cried
several
of
the
crew
with
sneers
and
catcalls
and
they
brandished
the
oar
at
him
over
their
heads
yelling
why
do
you
come
on
and
fight
illustration
the
unlucky
oar
was
seized
by
the
triumphant
crew
if
you
do
give
me
back
my
oar
cried
joel
angrily
and
paddling
for
dear
life
toward
them
it
be
worse
for
you
i
can
tell
you
my
grandpapa
he
was
drowned
in
a
storm
of
yells
your
granddaddy
fellows
this
baby
is
talking
of
his
granddaddy
and
they
screamed
in
derision
snapping
their
fingers
and
swinging
the
oar
as
high
as
they
could
tantalizingly
at
him
round
and
round
went
joel
boat
describing
a
series
of
curves
that
despite
all
his
efforts
only
carried
him
away
from
his
tormentors
what
he
would
have
done
had
he
reached
them
had
entered
his
head
his
only
thought
being
to
get
up
to
them
in
the
midst
of
this
interesting
proceeding
a
sharp
clap
of
thunder
reverberated
over
their
heads
to
be
almost
immediately
followed
by
a
piercing
gleam
of
lightning
it
produced
the
greatest
consternation
in
the
and
a
sudden
jump
on
the
part
of
nearly
every
boy
in
it
made
it
careen
then
turn
completely
over
and
before
they
were
fully
aware
every
single
one
was
in
the
water
screaming
and
struggling
wildly
in
the
upset
joel
oar
had
been
carried
out
too
and
as
it
happened
to
drift
toward
him
he
leaned
over
the
side
of
his
boat
managing
to
reach
it
with
the
other
one
do
catch
hold
of
each
other
he
yelled
his
mind
intent
on
helping
some
of
them
into
his
boat
but
as
well
talk
to
the
wind
the
boys
who
could
swim
and
most
of
them
were
in
that
plight
were
grabbing
this
way
and
that
to
seize
upon
anything
that
would
give
them
a
support
catch
hold
of
your
boat
roared
joel
at
them
but
instead
of
that
some
of
them
preferred
to
catch
hold
of
his
the
consequence
being
that
it
would
soon
have
been
upset
had
he
not
screamed
at
them
and
they
knew
he
meant
it
i
bang
you
across
the
head
if
you
try
it
lifting
his
oar
sturdily
you
fellows
who
can
swim
hold
up
the
others
and
i
take
you
all
off
to
the
bank
if
you
wo
crowd
and
seeing
that
this
was
all
they
could
get
and
that
joel
was
as
good
as
his
word
one
after
another
was
helped
in
the
others
wisely
catching
hold
of
the
overturned
boat
an
example
speedily
followed
till
all
were
either
in
joel
boat
and
rowing
quickly
off
to
shore
or
hanging
to
their
own
craft
the
leader
of
the
crew
huddled
sheepishly
down
over
his
oar
which
joel
handed
him
to
do
some
of
the
rowing
and
he
did
look
at
the
owner
of
the
boat
till
just
as
they
neared
the
bank
he
glanced
up
suddenly
and
said
say
you
i
you
tell
on
us
what
do
you
take
me
for
cried
joel
in
extreme
disgust
and
plying
his
oar
briskly
all
this
time
the
rain
had
come
down
in
torrents
till
there
was
much
difference
between
the
boys
who
had
been
in
the
water
and
the
one
who
had
kept
out
and
the
lightning
played
over
their
heads
in
unpleasant
zigzag
streaks
and
the
thunder
rolled
and
rumbled
the
leader
shivered
and
ducked
till
he
could
by
any
possibility
be
said
to
look
at
joel
well
i
would
if
i
was
you
the
words
came
in
a
burst
from
a
boy
supposed
to
be
in
such
a
condition
that
he
would
care
to
take
part
in
any
conversation
who
was
crouched
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
tell
every
single
thing
about
it
he
raised
himself
and
shook
his
fist
at
the
leader
very
face
if
it
had
been
for
you
mike
he
said
we
would
have
come
do
fight
said
joel
in
consternation
at
any
such
settling
of
their
differences
in
his
boat
you
upset
us
all
humph
the
boy
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
sneered
he
wo
fight
mike
wo
he
said
and
really
mike
did
look
as
if
he
would
for
he
crouched
and
cowered
lower
yet
till
joel
began
to
say
give
me
the
oar
for
it
wabbled
so
that
it
played
a
small
part
only
in
getting
the
craft
to
the
shore
some
other
fellow
take
it
said
the
boy
who
had
done
all
the
talking
i
would
he
lifted
a
red
and
ashamed
face
only
my
arm
is
it
hurt
asked
joel
rescuing
the
other
oar
from
mike
whose
nerves
seemed
to
have
all
gone
to
pieces
never
mind
said
the
other
boy
looking
more
ashamed
still
here
jimmy
you
take
the
oar
and
row
lively
now
so
with
jimmy
help
the
boat
ran
up
to
the
bank
there
you
are
cried
joel
as
they
were
dumped
out
to
keep
company
with
the
big
black
dog
who
sniffed
them
contemptuously
and
walked
around
their
dripping
bodies
as
they
sank
on
the
bank
this
was
the
kind
of
fun
he
had
meant
when
he
followed
his
master
out
and
not
at
all
to
his
taste
but
joel
was
just
in
his
element
and
when
he
brought
the
rest
off
from
the
overturned
boat
he
could
conceal
his
satisfaction
some
one
has
got
to
tell
about
that
boat
he
pointed
to
the
overturned
one
i
knew
you
would
blab
mike
turned
his
shame
disappearing
to
grow
red
with
passion
shut
up
it
was
the
other
boy
that
roared
at
him
who
injured
arm
or
not
could
somehow
inspire
the
former
leader
with
fear
i
going
to
tell
myself
an
if
any
of
you
fellows
has
got
spunk
he
tell
too
it
was
such
a
battle
cry
that
mike
head
went
down
he
knew
as
well
as
afterward
that
his
leadership
was
gone
and
that
every
one
of
the
crew
had
gone
over
to
the
other
boy
hi
yes
we
tell
if
jack
their
new
leader
could
decide
to
they
would
follow
him
and
they
yelled
it
out
much
better
than
any
one
would
suppose
possible
after
their
fright
turning
their
backs
on
mike
that
good
said
joel
bobbing
his
black
curls
from
which
the
rain
was
streaming
at
the
whole
bunch
of
boys
in
approval
and
taking
up
his
oars
he
prepared
to
move
off
if
you
only
tell
about
the
boat
oh
i
say
jack
seeing
that
he
was
now
the
recognized
leader
was
going
to
do
the
whole
thing
up
in
good
shape
we
much
obliged
and
who
are
you
anyway
he
broke
off
awkwardly
i
king
grandson
said
joel
well
mr
king
jack
gave
a
roll
over
and
groveled
in
the
wet
moss
oh
all
up
with
us
fellows
he
groaned
the
black
dog
who
belonged
to
him
came
and
licked
him
all
over
glaring
between
whiles
at
joel
as
if
he
were
the
cause
of
the
whole
trouble
the
bunch
of
boys
said
nothing
but
shivered
in
silence
well
said
joel
as
he
pushed
off
feeling
it
necessary
for
some
one
to
speak
and
i
hope
you
have
hurt
your
arm
much
to
the
recumbent
figure
do
let
him
hurt
these
chaps
your
grandfather
i
mean
jack
threw
up
his
head
and
pointed
to
the
boys
only
get
mike
licked
we
all
of
us
like
that
what
cried
joel
over
his
shoulder
stopping
his
busy
oars
why
when
you
tell
him
how
mean
we
used
you
do
let
him
get
those
chaps
into
trouble
when
i
tell
him
cried
joel
what
do
you
mean
why
of
course
you
tell
him
blurted
jack
mike
had
taken
to
his
heels
and
was
making
quick
tracks
with
his
sodden
shoes
through
the
undergrowth
things
were
not
going
to
his
taste
now
see
here
joel
made
quick
passes
now
with
the
oars
and
brought
his
boat
up
alongside
the
bank
i
not
going
to
tell
my
grandpapa
about
what
you
done
is
any
matter
you
ai
cried
jack
getting
up
so
quickly
he
upset
the
next
boy
who
rolled
over
the
big
black
dog
great
scott
you
ai
going
to
tell
the
old
gentleman
no
said
joel
i
do
care
anything
about
it
you
did
hurt
me
any
well
if
i
ever
it
was
all
that
jack
the
leader
could
get
out
and
joel
seeing
there
was
nothing
to
wait
for
set
to
work
again
and
presently
amid
the
rain
and
the
lightning
gleams
his
boat
was
only
a
little
speck
on
the
surface
of
the
pond
as
viewed
by
the
group
of
boys
on
the
bank
xviii
the
comfort
committee
oh
mary
eleanor
keep
seized
miss
taylor
arm
and
burst
into
tears
when
she
could
speak
she
gasped

mary

drawing
her
off
into
the
little
your
mother

must
think
of
her
nell
delafield

something
i
know
it
is
dreadful
eleanor
sank
upon
the
sofa
dragging
mary
taylor
with
her
oh
i
shall
die
if
you
do
tell
me
right
off
what
happened
mary
not
a
word

until
you
can
control
yourself
declared
miss
taylor
wresting
herself
away
from
the
nervous
grasp
and
running
over
to
the
door
she
closed
it
now
then
nell
are
you
a
sensible
girl
coming
back
eleanor
flung
herself
down
on
the
sofa
and
sobbed
oh
i
know
larry

dead
and
you
are
trying
to
keep
it
from
me
larry

said
mary
taylor
well
he
is
terribly

said
eleanor
between
her
sobs
oh
dear
my
only
brother
larry
mary
taylor
got
down
on
her
knees
by
the
sofa
and
took
the
poor
head
up
to
let
her
own
tears
fall
over
it
why
you
are
crying
yourself
exclaimed
eleanor
feeling
the
drops
trickle
down
her
neck
and
you
told
me
not
to
why
mary
taylor
of
course
i
am
said
mary
now

here
we
are
both
of
us
very
wrong
to
give
way
in
this
fashion
we
ought
to
be
seeing
to
your
mother
get
up
eleanor
and
she
sprang
to
her
feet
there
that
right
come
on
some
one
rapped
at
the
side
door
and
the
confusion
in
the
house
calling
the
maids
from
their
duty
the
butler
belonging
to
the
establishment
of
the
next
neighbor
sterling
popped
in
his
head
excuse
me
miss
he
said
to
mary
taylor
eleanor
being
beyond
a
reply
sterling
has
sent
for
you
ladies
to
come
in
there
and
stay
until
the
doctors
are
through
at
the
word
doctors
eleanor
shivered
and
covered
her
eyes
the
very
thing
said
mary
taylor
we
get
your
mother
in
there
and
with
a
message
back
to
sterling
the
two
young
ladies
hurried
off
and
before
larry
mother
quite
knew
how
she
was
in
the
beautiful
upper
room
of
the
stately
brownstone
mansion
and
face
to
face
with
its
invalid
mistress
condemned
for
years
to
lie
on
her
sofa
i
do
believe
said
sterling
putting
out
a
soft
hand
that
everything
will
be
much
better
than
you
think
we
shall
soon
have
cheering
news
i
feel
quite
sure
gibson
draw
up
the
so
that
right
gibson
quietly
did
as
bidden
and
keep
sank
into
it
and
laid
down
her
head
with
the
air
of
one
quite
done
with
the
world
to
add
to
the
gloom
a
terrible
thunderstorm
broke
suddenly
now
give
me
your
hand
sterling
leaned
over
and
drew
it
within
her
own
seeing
all
things
going
on
so
well
mary
taylor
and
eleanor
drew
off
into
the
hall
young
ladies
said
gibson
coming
out
softly
would
you
wish
to
go
down
into
the
mistress
would
like
to
have
you
make
yourselves
comfortable
the
storm
is
pretty
heavy
and
i
light
the
gas
oh
no

said
eleanor
shrinking
at
the
invitation
mary
do
go
she
whispered
i
should
die
there
in
that
big
stiff
room
we
sit
just
here
said
mary
taylor
come
on
nell
and
down
they
both
got
on
the
top
stair
huddling
up
together
while
the
storm
raged
outside
in
its
fury
oh
young
ladies
exclaimed
gibson
starting
i
get
you
some
chairs
if
you
want
to
sit
in
the
hall
we
like
this
said
mary
taylor
please
gibson
do
feel
troubled
so
gibson
went
back
to
her
mistress
room
and
mary
put
her
arm
around
eleanor
and
patted
her
hair
as
she
cuddled
up
to
her
neck
mary
i
like
you
so
much
sobbed
eleanor
in
a
muffled
voice
because
you
do
try
to
say
something
to
comfort
me
mary
kept
on
patting
the
pretty
hair
with
anxious
ears
for
the
messenger
to
come
from
the
keep
household
presently
out
came
gibson
again
i
going
out
to
bring
in
those
boys
she
said
mistress
wants
it
what
boys
asked
mary
quickly
the
whole
of
them
said
gibson
they
been
hanging
around
ever
since
master
larry
was
brought
home
and
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
eleanor
faintly
and
sterling
wants
them
invited
in
here
to
wait
exclaimed
mary
how
kind
of
her
now
then
nell
that
work
for
you
and
for
me
we
must
help
those
boys
to
get
a
little
comfort
as
gibson
went
quickly
down
the
long
stairs
on
her
errand
oh
i
ca
cried
eleanor
burrowing
into
the
soft
neck
yes
you
can
i
his
sister
and
you
ca
expect
me
to
see
them
yes
i
do
said
mary
firmly
it
exactly
what
you
ought
to
do
going
down
to
welcome
them
and
you
must
come
too
come
on
eleanor
simply
got
to
do
it
eleanor
seeing
nothing
for
it
unless
she
were
to
be
left
alone
on
her
stair
which
would
have
been
the
last
thing
to
be
endured
got
up
and
followed
slowly
to
be
met
at
the
big
door
leading
to
the
side
porch
by
the
company
of
boys
well
boys
said
mary
cheerfully
i
glad
you
come
to
help
eleanor
and
me
every
boy
looked
up
in
great
surprise
for
they
all
supposed
they
were
left
to
comfort
themselves
ca
we
sit
in
the
asked
mary
with
a
thought
for
the
cheerful
red
carpet
and
curtains
mistress
wants
them
to
come
up
into
her
said
gibson
her
exclaimed
mary
yes
miss
she
says
they
can
help
keep
and
her
said
gibson
standing
with
folded
hands
deferentially
but
yet
quite
expecting
the
command
to
be
carried
out
the
boys
stood
up
a
little
taller
yet
evidently
they
were
thought
worthy
of
consideration
in
the
way
of
administering
consolation
instead
of
hanging
around
useless
creatures
in
everybody
way
in
that
case
said
mary
taylor
we
all
go
upstairs
at
once
so
they
all
filed
up
the
long
flight
and
gibson
held
open
the
door
and
sterling
from
her
sofa
called
out
boys
yon
do
know
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
all
and
just
as
they
began
to
feel
a
little
bit
of
hope
down
in
their
hearts
it
was
so
much
easier
all
bearing
the
suspense
together
a
light
tripping
step
came
up
the
staircase
and
little
doctor
fisher
big
spectacles
were
thrust
in
the
doorway
just
right
very
sensible
he
beamed
at
them
all
and
darted
over
and
took
the
poor
mother
hand
your
boy
is
all
right
he
said
his
collar
bone
is
broken
to
be
sure
but
it
is
a
beautiful
fracture
and
he
has
some
bruises
thank
the
lord
it
is
no
worse
there
was
a
rustle
back
of
him
then
two
or
three
boys
broke
from
the
group
and
fell
upon
him
in
the
rear
is
that
true
the
foremost
one
shouted
eh
little
doctor
fisher
whirled
around
yes
indeed
true
as
gospel
oh
see
here
now
as
the
whole
bunch
made
a
mad
plunge
for
the
hall
come
back
here
boys
every
single
one
came
slowly
back
except
frick
he
had
cleared
the
space
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
was
now
making
his
quickest
time
on
record
down
the
flight
you
are
not
to
cheer
i
see
you
want
to
and
doctor
fisher
gave
a
little
laugh
yes
sir
curtis
park
answered
for
the
rest
well
you
doctor
fisher
it
was
sterling
who
interrupted
and
she
smiled
i
should
very
much
like
to
hear
that
cheer
now
exclaimed
the
little
doctor
gazing
at
her
over
his
spectacles
oh
it
would
do
me
good
i
assure
you
said
sterling
leaning
back
in
a
satisfied
way
against
her
pillows
so
if
you
please
boys
let
me
hear
it
at
once
smiling
at
them
and
they
gave
it
then
and
there
the
poor
mother
in
all
this
confusion
getting
time
to
recover
herself
and
then
three
more
for
the
little
doctor
and
then
one
of
the
boys
the
least
likely
to
have
courage
to
propose
it
piped
out
let
give
her
three
pointing
to
the
hostess
how
pleased
the
poor
invalid
was
and
how
she
beamed
at
them
all
and
when
doctor
fisher
saw
that
he
was
so
well
satisfied
that
he
shook
hands
with
them
all
quite
around
the
circle
now
i
must
go
i
look
in
again
on
your
boy
in
an
hour
madam
to
keep
meantime
i
stay
over
here
for
i
sent
for
a
nurse
from
the
hospital
he
must
be
kept
quiet
a
spell
and
he
was
off
now
boys
there
was
a
pretty
pink
spot
in
either
cheek
as
sterling
turned
to
them
do
you
know
i
thought
of
a
plan
by
which
you
might
do
something
for
lawrence
what
oh
what
they
crowded
up
to
her
sofa
gibson
from
the
doorway
where
she
had
retreated
to
be
within
call
looked
a
little
anxious
but
catching
a
glance
from
her
mistress
smoothed
out
her
face
again
what
is
your
plan
asked
curtis
it
really
seemed
as
if
the
boys
had
been
accustomed
to
gather
in
that
room
by
the
way
in
which
they
now
crowded
up
as
comrades
entering
into
anything
that
might
be
proposed
you
know
that
before
long
lawrence
will
be
able
to
see
you
we
hope
began
sterling
in
her
cheeriest
way
gibson
push
up
that
pillow
a
little
more
oh
i
will
cried
curtis
springing
forward
gibson
in
great
trepidation
at
any
one
performing
the
office
for
her
mistress
started
to
do
it
but
curtis
was
already
most
gallantly
if
a
trifle
awkwardly
pushing
up
the
pillow
giving
it
a
rousing
thump
that
got
on
the
nerves
of
the
maid
you
should
have
waited
for
me
she
said
tartly
never
mind
that
is
all
right
sterling
smiled
up
at
him
where
he
stood
the
hot
blood
in
his
face
and
his
eyes
downcast
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
curtis
i
guess
you
are
accustomed
to
do
it
for
your
mother
she
said
encouragingly
i
do
i
am
he
said
incoherently
beginning
to
feel
better
it
was
only
gibson
who
was
cross
he
reflected
sterling
herself
was
as
nice
as
she
could
be
well
now
if
i
were
you
said
sterling
turning
on
her
pillow
to
get
a
good
look
at
them
all
i
form
a
committee
a
comfort
committee
to
think
up
things
that
will
interest
lawrence
and
by
and
by
the
doctor
is
going
to
let
you
go
to
see
him
and
what
things
the
small
boy
who
had
proposed
the
cheers
for
sterling
now
pushed
to
the
front
so
as
to
get
a
good
look
at
her
tell
me
please
what
things
well
you
can
cut
out
funny
things
from
the
magazines
and
papers
for
one
thing
said
sterling
quite
delighted
at
the
success
of
her
plan
so
far
and
the
nurse
can
read
them
to
him
i
got
a
lot
of
numbers
cried
one
boy
and
said
another
and
oceans
of
magazines
they
all
shouted
one
thing
and
another
gibson
who
by
this
time
was
tired
of
popping
her
head
in
and
out
had
withdrawn
to
a
little
room
opening
out
of
her
mistress
apartment
and
taken
up
her
sewing
quite
convinced
that
far
from
its
being
a
cause
for
alarm
everything
was
going
on
finely
well
now
just
see
how
much
pleasure
that
will
give
him
sterling
was
saying
what
else
asked
the
small
boy
then
has
any
one
of
you
any
puzzles
asked
sterling
or
conundrums
do
you
think
that
is
fine
to
have
something
to
think
of
beside
dismal
things
when
you
lie
in
bed
curtis
park
was
just
in
his
element
here
for
he
dearly
loved
puzzles
and
conundrums
and
presently
sterling
and
he
were
busily
talking
over
this
and
that
kind
and
book
and
collection
until
finally
the
small
boy
pulled
the
fringe
of
her
pink
crocheted
shawl
i
want
to
know
what
else
dear
me
sterling
looked
up
quickly
to
give
a
little
laugh
it
was
loud
but
so
cheery
and
sweet
that
gibson
in
the
little
outer
room
dropped
her
sewing
in
her
lap
thank
the
lord
she
said
and
wiped
her
eyes
frick
meanwhile
too
excited
to
hear
the
doctor
call
them
to
come
back
had
darted
out
of
the
house
with
no
thought
for
the
rain
but
with
one
wild
desire
to
find
joel
pepper
and
as
he
had
a
perfect
faculty
for
sprinting
and
cut
through
with
a
dash
all
the
he
soon
found
himself
for
the
second
time
that
day
at
the
king
mansion
but
this
second
time
he
was
no
more
fortunate
than
the
first
for
although
he
was
willingly
admitted
to
king
it
was
to
see
that
gentleman
look
up
and
say
with
the
most
genial
of
smiles
ah
frick
my
boy
well
this
time
it
all
right
is
it
since
i
let
joel
go
down
to
you
joel
has
been
with
us
blurted
out
frick
then
he
leaned
against
the
big
speech
all
gone
for
he
began
to
feel
terribly
tired
and
it
had
been
nothing
but
one
long
disappointment
all
day
old
king
laid
down
his
pen
and
looked
frick
all
over
oh
no
he
has
declared
frick
shaking
his
head
dismally
we
any
of
us
seen
him
and
larry
keep
has
been
run
over
by
tallyho
and
most
smashed
up
then
he
stopped
suddenly
his
cup
of
woe
being
empty
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
find
joel
said
king
to
himself
anxiously
the
storm
is
almost
over
to
be
sure
glancing
out
of
the
window
but
where
can
he
be
he
hurried
across
the
room
and
touched
the
electric
button
you
have
the
least
idea
frick
where
to
look
for
him
eh
no
sir
said
frick
miserably
thomas
popped
his
head
in
to
be
given
the
order
to
have
one
of
the
carriages
brought
round
just
then
in
ran
jasper
he
had
been
caught
by
the
sudden
shower
over
at
pickering
dodge
father
he
cried
his
face
glowing
i
come
home
as
soon
as
it
slacked
up
a
bit
why
you
are
not
going
out
seeing
the
old
gentleman
beginning
to
don
his
mackintosh
yes
i
am
said
king
grimly
going
to
do
just
that
very
thing
jasper
oh
let
me
father
jasper
sprang
to
his
side
eagerly
then
looked
in
a
puzzled
way
over
to
frick
it
joel
said
frick
feeling
that
it
was
expected
of
him
to
furnish
an
answer
joel
cried
jasper
the
color
going
out
of
his
cheek
yes
joel
ca
be
found
said
old
king
speaking
lightly
to
hide
the
dismay
he
really
felt
it
all
right
of
course
he
probably
at
one
of
the
boys
houses
only
as
he
was
to
join
frick
why
i
prefer
to
look
him
up
a
bit
well
there
thomas
glancing
out
of
the
window
oh
let
me
go
for
him
begged
jasper
i
can
find
him
surely
you
need
to
father
do
pray
in
all
this
rain
i
am
going
after
joel
declared
his
father
quite
obstinately
so
say
no
more
about
it
jasper
moving
past
him
to
the
door
come
along
frick
my
boy
you
might
as
well
come
too
let
me
go
too
cried
jasper
oh
father
ca
i
i
can
at
least
help
he
did
say
take
care
of
you
but
he
really
felt
anxious
to
the
last
degree
yes
yes
said
his
father
of
course
you
may
come
if
you
like
so
jasper
well
pleased
rushed
for
his
mackintosh
and
all
three
got
into
the
carriage
and
thomas
whirled
them
off
in
his
best
style
it
is
really
worth
while
to
worry
fisher
said
old
king
when
well
on
the
way
for
we
shall
probably
soon
run
across
joel
as
bright
as
a
button
and
gay
as
a
lark
bless
me
how
this
rain
comes
down
xix
joel
new
friend
but
no
joel
bright
as
a
button
and
gay
as
a
lark
came
in
sight
instead
at
a
corner
they
were
turning
rapidly
king
in
desperation
giving
the
order
to
drive
to
one
of
the
boys
houses
most
likely
to
attract
attention
this
morning
thomas
came
to
an
abrupt
halt
that
nearly
threw
the
horses
back
on
their
haunches
what
are
you
about
there
he
cried
in
vexation
ca
you
keep
out
from
under
the
horses
heels
i
like
to
know
the
boy
thus
addressed
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
the
irate
coachman
but
advanced
to
the
carriage
door
he
seemed
to
have
something
the
matter
with
his
arm
that
would
evidently
have
given
him
a
good
deal
of
bother
had
his
mind
been
on
anything
but
the
desire
to
attract
attention
but
that
gentleman
violently
jolted
by
the
sudden
of
the
horses
not
being
in
the
best
frame
of
mind
called
out
testily
bless
me
what
is
the
man
stopping
for
drive
on
thomas
and
looked
directly
over
his
head
seeing
which
the
boy
clambered
up
the
carriage
step
and
hung
on
with
one
hand
but
so
much
determination
was
in
his
eyes
that
old
king
fumed
out
make
the
scoundrel
get
down
jasper
what
do
you
want
asked
jasper
trying
to
make
it
as
pleasant
as
possible
before
the
more
summary
treatment
set
in
i
got
to
speak
to
him
said
the
boy
thomas
gathering
up
the
reins
in
one
hand
and
the
whip
in
the
other
looked
around
with
fury
in
his
eye
shall
i
give
him
a
lick
he
asked
no
no
said
jasper
hastily
keep
quiet
thomas
i
nothing
to
say
to
you
cried
king
in
his
most
pompous
way
and
with
a
stately
wave
of
his
hand
so
take
yourself
off
boy
father
began
jasper
in
a
distressed
tone
and
be
quick
about
it
the
old
gentleman
fairly
roared
it
out
thomas
drive
on
that
functionary
with
a
very
dissatisfied
expression
that
he
had
been
allowed
to
use
his
whip
when
he
got
it
all
ready
so
nicely
now
cracked
it
at
the
horses
the
boy
with
one
hesitating
glance
at
jasper
slid
off
the
down
to
the
street
and
yelled
defiantly
up
into
face
as
the
brougham
spun
off
i
was
going
to
tell
you
where
your
boy
is
father
exclaimed
jasper
with
a
white
face
he
must
know
where
joel
is
thomas
stop
for
thomas
having
no
other
way
to
vent
his
vexation
took
it
out
in
driving
as
fast
as
possible
so
he
did
hear
what
was
going
on
in
the
coach
eh
king
was
saying
in
bewilderment
at
last
jasper
succeeded
in
getting
his
wishes
known
and
once
more
the
horses
were
jerked
back
for
the
summons
was
quick
and
sharp
by
this
time
the
boy
was
off
and
although
jasper
peered
this
way
and
that
he
could
see
nothing
of
the
old
blue
cap
that
had
adorned
the
head
thrust
over
the
carriage
door
he
knows
something
about
joel
father
you
may
depend
persisted
jasper
we
must
find
him
frick
who
had
been
ready
to
cry
all
huddled
down
in
his
corner
now
sat
straight
for
it
did
seem
to
be
just
the
time
for
tears
and
in
a
minute
he
had
scrambled
past
king
and
hopped
out
i
going
to
find
him
came
back
on
the
air
as
he
shot
off
do
you
wait
here
father
said
jasper
following
him
and
leaping
out
and
we
get
the
boy
but
the
boy
quite
willing
to
tell
whatever
story
there
was
on
his
mind
when
he
jumped
on
the
carriage
step
was
now
of
a
different
mind
and
he
ran
like
a
deer
first
down
one
street
then
another
at
last
finding
himself
pursued
by
some
one
not
at
all
inclined
to
easily
give
up
the
chase
it
suddenly
dawned
on
him
that
his
blue
cap
might
possibly
be
a
means
of
tracing
his
course
so
he
twitched
it
off
and
tucked
it
under
his
well
arm
this
made
it
more
difficult
for
jasper
whose
footsteps
were
fast
gaining
on
him
to
follow
him
accurately
and
for
the
first
time
a
horrible
moment
came
to
the
pursuer
when
he
thought
that
after
all
the
boy
might
escape
but
frick
who
had
seen
jasper
nimble
progress
around
a
corner
ran
down
a
side
street
then
across
a
garden
and
came
plump
into
the
face
of
the
boy
here
he
is
cried
frick
the
breath
almost
knocked
out
of
him
by
the
encounter
he
had
grasped
whatever
he
could
first
lay
his
fingers
on
and
held
to
it
firmly
it
proved
to
be
the
arm
for
which
the
boy
had
not
appeared
to
have
much
use
once
caught
the
boy
gave
a
groan
then
started
to
run
frick
being
smaller
it
might
be
an
easy
matter
to
shake
him
off
even
with
only
one
available
arm
no
you
do
get
away
this
time
said
frick
for
the
tall
boy
had
him
in
hand
now
and
was
marching
him
back
to
the
carriage
at
a
pace
much
more
comfortable
for
all
concerned
what
have
you
to
tell
us
he
was
being
asked
i
would
have
told
you
then
said
the
boy
doggedly
he
could
help
but
show
some
suffering
in
his
face
and
jasper
looking
down
to
see
its
cause
found
one
arm
hanging
in
a
very
peculiar
manner
you
hurt
your
arm
he
said
abruptly
frick
take
care
to
the
boy
not
at
all
particular
what
he
took
hold
of
if
he
only
got
a
good
grip
well
he
sha
get
away
said
frick
decidedly
nipping
up
the
end
of
the
jacket
nearest
to
him
how
did
you
hurt
your
arm
asked
jasper
despite
all
his
anxiety
about
joel
and
an
awful
feeling
that
in
some
way
an
accident
had
occurred
that
had
enveloped
them
both
he
looked
into
he
face
beneath
him
with
real
concern
none
of
your
business
the
boy
was
going
to
say
but
instead
he
turned
away
his
face
then
brought
it
back
and
defiance
was
written
all
over
it
he
sassed
me
that
old
fellow
in
the
carriage
did
you
i
tell
him
after
that
he
dreadfully
anxious
said
jasper
ignoring
everything
else
you
see
joel
been
gone
in
all
this
storm
and
we
do
know
anything
in
the
world
where
he
is
i
do
said
the
boy
then
if
you
do
jasper
stopped
suddenly
and
brought
his
keen
dark
eyes
to
bear
on
the
rough
defiant
face
i
just
hope
you
will
tell
me
and
i
know
you
will
he
added
after
a
pause
in
which
frick
fastened
his
gaze
on
them
both
wildly
luckily
without
discovering
any
use
for
his
tongue
the
boy
swallowed
hard
dropped
his
eyes
for
a
moment
then
looked
up
he
was
out
on
the
pond
out
on
the
pond
echoed
frick
and
his
hand
nipping
the
fell
nerveless
to
his
side
no
one
told
you
to
speak
said
the
boy
sharply
turning
on
him
so
you
shut
up
but
what
was
he
doing
out
on
the
pond
in
such
a
storm
asked
jasper
his
lips
were
white
but
he
did
allow
his
eyes
to
waver
for
it
was
better
to
have
the
whole
story
before
getting
back
to
his
father
it
did
rain
till
after
we
had
the
row
said
the
boy
had
the
row
it
seemed
an
eternity
to
jasper
for
joel
perhaps
even
now
might
be
in
peril
before
the
next
question
was
answered
what
row
yes
said
the
boy
as
if
he
were
going
to
add
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
the
next
moment
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
tell
all
there
was
to
tell
it
was
exactly
clear
why
but
he
was
giving
the
account
in
a
very
few
words
leaving
it
where
it
ended
with
his
seeing
joel
rowing
off
down
the
pond
and
presently
the
two
who
had
hopped
out
of
the
carriage
with
the
new
boy
and
the
one
who
had
thrust
his
head
in
over
the
door
were
seated
in
the
brougham
and
thomas
had
turned
his
back
on
the
city
streets
and
was
driving
off
at
a
furious
pace
for
spy
pond
frick
collapsed
now
and
mumbled
distractedly
oh
dear
now
joel
what
he
did
trust
himself
to
say
and
larry
killed
and
jasper
interrupted
him
sharply
what
do
you
say
frick
for
it
was
the
first
hint
of
anything
gone
wrong
with
any
of
the
other
boys
then
out
came
that
story
to
add
to
the
general
misery
and
old
king
sat
very
straight
and
kept
saying
bless
me
tell
thomas
to
drive
faster
and
oh
bless
me
again
as
he
glanced
over
at
the
boy
but
no
joel
they
pranced
the
horses
did
shaking
off
the
rain
from
their
wet
manes
around
as
much
of
the
pond
as
was
adapted
to
carriages
and
jasper
and
frick
got
out
and
explored
the
rest
at
least
wherever
joel
would
be
supposed
to
put
into
port
the
boy
holding
up
the
arm
that
appeared
not
to
be
in
its
usual
condition
and
going
along
too
yet
unable
to
add
any
information
to
his
original
statement
at
last
probably
gone
home
it
was
all
jasper
could
do
to
get
the
words
out
of
his
white
lips
without
a
word
old
king
sank
back
and
waved
his
hand
which
meant
yes
settling
down
amongst
the
cushions
hopelessly
while
their
faces
were
turned
homeward
hullo
unmistakably
joel
voice
and
there
he
was
wet
and
dirty
and
waving
frantically
from
a
side
street
for
them
to
stop
as
he
made
his
best
time
to
the
corner
jasper
threw
wide
the
door
he
cried
thomas
pulled
up
again
the
horses
by
this
time
having
become
so
well
accustomed
to
this
method
of
bringing
up
that
they
did
it
quite
well
and
there
was
a
great
in
the
coach
i
been
calling
and
calling
panted
joel
blowing
like
a
porpoise
and
running
up
with
red
cheeks
and
you
would
stop
he
added
in
a
very
injured
way
well
we
did
hear
you
you
beggar
cried
jasper
come
get
in
with
you
putting
out
both
hands
to
assist
in
the
process
where
have
you
been
joe
for
old
king
was
beyond
talking
i
been
began
joel
glad
enough
to
hop
in
why
where

his
black
eyes
fell
on
the
boy
in
the
corner

tried
to
swarm
all
over
him
but
joel
put

an
unsteady
hand

involuntarily

joe
said
jasper
affectionately
who

back
frick
flew
over
to
the
opposite
side
and
let
joel
snuggle
up
to
the
old
gentleman
i
here
grandpapa
he
said
happily

old

brokenly
and
fondling
the

brown

cried
joel
i

a
drowned
rat
joe
declared
jasper
bursting
into
a
laugh
which
was
such
a
relief
to
all
concerned
that
in
a
minute
it
really
seemed
like
a
pleasure
excursion
but
joel
pulled
himself
up
oh
i
going
to
see
what
the
matter
with
jack
arm
and
he
leaned
over
and
put
his
hand
on

jack
trying
to
pull
it
away
but
joel
held
on

his
ears
doctor
fisher

frick
began
jasper
desperately
look
out
and
see
if
it
rains
frick
stared
in
amazement
and
even
joel
bobbed
his
head
over
at
jasper
why
does
it
rain
on
your
side
he
cried
his
black
eyes
very
wide
never
mind
do
as
i
tell
you
said
jasper
nowise
disconcerted
so
frick
reported
that
it
did
rain
and
then
jasper
began
to
talk
so
fast
that
joel
had
no
time
to
get
in
a
word
at
all
although
he
tried
with
all
his
might
see
here
he
shouted
at
last
and
his
voice
rang
clear
above
every
other
noise
ca
we
take
him
to
doctor
fisher
office
ca
we
grandpapa
make
thomas
turn
about
and
take
us

he
fairly
howled
it
now
and
doctor
fisher
wo

there
screamed
frick
on
just
as
high
a
key
why
not
it
was
impossible
to
stop
the
dreadful
news
of
larry
accident
from
coming
now
and
in
a
minute
frick
had
it
all
out
in
a
burst
quite
unconscious
of
jasper
efforts
and
well
pleased
at
having
something
important
to
say
larry
been
run
over
by
macilvaine
tallyho
and
smashed
to
death
xx
the
cooking
club
oh
my
goodness
me
alexia
gave
a
jump
then
ran
for
the
closet
dear
me
exclaimed
polly
standing
quite
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
lightning
flash
and
the
sudden
peal
of
thunder
coming
without
warning
oh
i
scared
to
death
cried
alexia
burrowing
frantically
come
in
here
polly
pepper
are
you
killed
she
screamed
no
said
polly
and
i
do
believe
there
be
another
as
bad
oh
come
in
here
ooh
cried
alexia
in
muffled
accents
as
she
huddled
up
against
the
clothes
oh
polly
it
was
miss
rhys
her
embroidery
cast
aside
at
the
sudden
was
dragging
behind
her
and
she
was
wringing
her
hands
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
dreadful
i
do
believe
there
be
another
as
bad
said
polly
again
finding
nothing
more
of
consolation
to
offer
and
where
is
alexia
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
miss
rhys
paced
nervously
up
and
down
the
room
still
wringing
her
hands
and
of
course
there
will
be
more
there
there
it
comes
and
she
ran
the
still
hanging
to
her
gown
into
the
closet
oh
aunt
cried
alexia
with
a
squeal
you
scared
me
to
death
i
thought
i
was
struck
why
are
you
here
alexia
gasped
miss
rhys
when
she
could
recover
herself
enough
to
speak
well
this
is
truly
a
dreadful
storm
and
she
clutched
her
with
shaking
fingers
yes
i
am
here
said
alexia
do
pinch
so
aunt
ow
my
arm
is
all
black
and
blue
i
know
it
is
it
no
time
to
think
of
such
little
things
alexia
replied
her
aunt
severely
it
may
kill
us
both
well
that
no
reason
i
should
be
all
pinched
to
death
grumbled
alexia
forgetting
the
thunderstorm
in
her
present
discomfort
and
edging
off
as
well
as
she
could
the
closet
is
dreadfully
small
aunt
it
quite
large
enough
i
sure
to
protect
us
said
miss
rhys
hanging
tightly
to
her
with
trembling
fingers
dear
me
any
minute
may
be
our
last
well
i
not
going
to
be
smothered
to
death
declared
alexia
struggling
to
work
her
way
past
her
aunt
alexia
exclaimed
her
aunt
i
going
after
polly
alexia
out
in
the
middle
of
the
room
flung
her
arm
around
polly
oh
misery
where
as
a
vivid
flash
seemed
to
hop
right
in
the
window
oh
polly
come
she
clutched
her
wildly
where
said
polly
we
ca
get
away
from
it
alexia
it
just
everywhere
oh
i
do
care
anywhere
in
the
cried
alexia
frantically
dragging
her
along
i
shall
just
die
polly
pepper
and
here
you
stand
like
a
stick
well
there
just
no
use
in
running
said
polly
but
seeing
distress
she
suffered
herself
to
be
led
and
downstairs
the
two
girls
sped
and
into
the
landlady
room
the
first
door
to
stand
ajar
i
coming
in
announced
alexia
without
ceremony
for
i
scared
to
death
and
she
dragged
polly
pepper
after
her
did
you
ever
see
such
a
thunderstorm
mrs
cummings
it
is
pretty
bad
a
voice
answered
it
was
cummings
as
she
had
hurried
to
oversee
the
maid
close
the
windows
through
the
house
but
another
of
the
boarders
who
like
alexia
had
selected
this
apartment
for
a
refuge
oh
dear
me
alexia
sank
down
upon
the
sofa
being
careful
not
to
relinquish
her
hold
of
polly
and
dragged
a
cushion
over
her
face
is
that
you
filbert
bringing
out
one
eye
to
stare
at
him
i
think
so
said
filbert
a
little
thin
old
man
sitting
over
in
the
corner
and
leaning
forward
over
his
cane
he
spoke
cautiously
as
if
not
quite
sure
yes
it
a
bad
storm
he
repeated
decidedly
where
is
your
aunt
she
up
in
the
closet
said
alexia
pulling
the
over
her
own
and
polly
face
as
well
there
we
ca
see
it
at
any
rate
if
we
are
going
to
be
killed
up
in
the
closet
repeated
filbert
yes
oh
polly
do
you
suppose
it
lightening
and
thundering
now
as
the
two
girls
cuddled
up
closer
together
on
the
roomy
old
sofa
the
cushion
crowded
up
over
eyes
and
ears
i
suppose
so
said
polly
very
much
wishing
she
could
say
no
oh
dear
me
i
smothered
to
death
grumbled
alexia
and
i
so
hot
wriggling
discontentedly
so
am
i
said
polly
what
did
you
say
your
aunt
was
in
the
closet
little
old
filbert
was
asking
and
receiving
no
reply
he
kept
on
oh
do
hear
him
whispered
alexia
back
of
the
he
is
so
tiresome
asking
the
same
thing
over
and
over
well
do
answer
him
said
polly
i
have
once
said
alexia
is
your
aunt
in
the
closet
did
you
say
filbert
kept
on
with
the
impression
that
a
reply
would
soon
be
coming
if
he
only
held
up
the
conversation
at
his
end
of
it
alexia
dashed
down
the
with
a
nervous
hand
i
ca
breathe
let
get
out
polly
and
she
flew
up
to
sit
quite
straight
yes

aunt

am
so
scared

declared
the
little
old
gentleman
positively
alexia
hopped
off
from
the
sofa
and
ran
on
anxious
feet
to
his
chair
what
did
yon
say
filbert
and
how
do
you
know
she
cried
all
in
one
breath
the
chimney

the
lightning

said
filbert
cheerfully
you
see
it
alexia
dashed
off

through
the
hall
and
up
to
her
own
room
aunt

she
cried
thrusting
her
head
into
the
closet
you
be
struck
in
there
filbert
says
so

out
aunt
there
was
no
response
and
alexia
now
in
mortal
terror
plunged
into
the
closet
come
aunt
oh
my
as
a
clap
of
thunder
sent
her
plunging
in
headlong
why
where
for
grope
as
she
might
clear
up
to
the
end
among
the
clothes
and
the
no
miss
rhys
was
to
be
found
oh
dear
dear
alexia
began
to
whimper
feeling
all
around
the
floor
with
fingers
aunt
where
are
you
oh
she
been
struck
and
she
dead
i
know
she
is

screamed
tumbling
out
of
the
closet
to
rush
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
come
up
and
help
me
find
aunt
alexia
miss
rhys
concluding
not
to
be
left
alone
in
the
closet
when
the
two
girls
ran
downstairs
had
hurried
out
after
them
and
now
appeared
from
the
hall
corner
where
she
had
crouched
do
scream
so
oh
aunt
cried
alexia
throwing
her
arms
around
her

been
struck

miss
rhys
there

mussing
my
lace
collar
and
she
edged
off
from
the
nervous
fingers
we
go
downstairs
i
think
and
stay
with
mrs
cummings
if
you
really
sure
you
are
not

said
alexia
eying
her
askance
as
if
in
considerable
doubt
we
go
and
polly
pepper
is
there
and
that
tiresome
old
mr
filbert
if
polly
is
there
she
must
stay
to
luncheon
said
miss
rhys
gathering
up
her
skirts
and
preparing
to
descend
the
stairs
oh
how
fine
exclaimed
alexia
hopping
after
losing
sight
of
the
thunderstorm
in
the
delight
of
having
polly
pepper
to
herself
for
so
many
hours
oh
aunt
what
that
tagging
after
you
catching
sight
of
the
piece
of
embroidery
dangling
from
her
aunt
long
figure
i
see
nothing
said
miss
rhys
turning
around
with
her
head
over
her
shoulder
well
do
stand
still
aunt
cried
alexia
a
minute
what
is
it
miss
rhys
kept
saying
trying
to
see
for
herself
your
centerpiece
oh
dear
me
alexia
by
this
time
had
it
free
and
burst
into
a
laugh
as
she
held
it
up
well
now
i
expect
i
have
dragged
off
my
green
floss
exclaimed
her
aunt
in
irritation
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
well
be
in
the
closet
said
alexia
who
did
relish
offering
to
go
back
hurt
it
to
stay
there
a
little
while
i
must
find
it
said
miss
rhys
decidedly
and
alexia
wild
to
go
down
to
tell
polly
pepper
she
was
to
stay
to
luncheon
flew
over
the
stairs
leaving
her
aunt
to
get
her
green
floss
as
she
could
but
i
ca
said
polly
when
alexia
had
hugged
her
and
danced
around
her
to
her
heart
content
i
must
go
home
why
polly
pepper
you
ca
ever
go
in
this
awful
rain
it
is
going
to
rain
much
more
said
polly
running
over
to
the
window
to
flatten
her
face
against
the
pane
you
be
struck
if
you
do
that
little
filbert
looked
after
her
in
disapproval
the
window
is
the
worst
place
in
a
thunderstorm
you
see
it
oh
that
what
you
said
about
the
chimney
closet
said
alexia
in
scorn
and
there
ca
be
two
places
that
are
the
worst
oh
alexia
said
polly
looking
back
from
the
window
well
he
so
tiresome
said
alexia
putting
her
arm
around
her
and
gazing
out
of
the
window
that
just
the
way
he
goes
on
at
the
table
every
single
day
oh
see
it
rain
polly
pepper
it
slackening
said
polly
peering
up
at
the
drops
that
really
were
beginning
to
fall
with
little
spaces
between
and
mamsie
will
send
for
me
soon
i
guess
oh
well
it
will
begin
again
most
likely
said
alexia
i
hope
this
thunderstorm
will
last
till
ever
so
late
this
afternoon
oh
alexia
rhys
cried
polly
in
great
distress
and
whirling
away
from
the
window
do
wish
that
why
i
must
get
home
well
i
do
said
alexia
bobbing
her
light
hair
till
the
fluffs
settled
over
her
forehead
for
then
you
stay
you
have
been
over
here
in
ever
and
ever
so
long
polly
pepper
she
said
in
an
injured
voice
and
got
so
very
much
to
talk
with
you
about
well
let
talk
now
then
said
polly
with
a
sigh
yet
feeling
quite
sure
that
she
would
soon
be
sent
for
to
go
home
come
over
to
the
sofa
then
said
alexia
so
they
ran
over
and
together
settled
as
far
back
into
the
corner
as
they
could
pushing
up
one
of
the
cushions
comfortably
behind
them
well
now
you
begin
said
polly
oh
no
you
said
alexia
having
no
notion
of
doing
the
talking
for
it
was
always
great
fun
to
listen
to
polly
pepper
why
i
thought
you
said
you
had
ever
so
much
to
talk
over
said
polly
so
i
have
said
alexia
coolly
we
always
do
have
you
know
we
do
polly
well
now
begin
but
it
your
place
to
begin
first
said
polly
decidedly
because
you
said
you
had
something
to
talk
over
so
what
is
it
alexia
well
alexia
drew
a
long
breath
cudgeling
her
brains
then
burst
out
we
must
think
of
something
new
to
do
now
polly
since
the
garden
party
is
over
i
know
said
polly
how
i
wish
we
could
get
up
something
else
for
our
fancy
work
is
all
done
oh
was
it
just
gorgeous
alexia
with
a
comfortable
little
wriggle
i
should
say
it
was
cried
alexia
and
did
it
sell
though
and
everybody
wished
there
was
more
except
my
horrible
old
shawl
why
alexia
rhys
polly
poked
up
her
head
where
she
had
been
nestling
it
on
alexia
shoulder
you
know
sterling
sent
for
the
shawl
and
gave
five
dollars
for
it
oh
that
was
because
she
knew
it
was
so
ugly
that
no
one
else
would
buy
it
said
alexia
composedly
well
i
do
care
so
long
as
it
sold
i
was
just
tired
to
death
of
that
old
thing
polly
i
do
want
to
ever
see
another
shawl
well
we
sha
have
another
fair
in
a
long
while
i
suppose
said
polly
with
a
sigh
and
laying
her
head
down
again
not
till
next
summer
said
alexia
then
says
i
for
a
garden
party
you
know
your
grandpapa
said
he
give
you
another
just
as
nice
a
one
then
but
that
a
whole
year
said
polly
disconsolately
it
so
very
long
to
wait
well
i
suppose
we
must
think
of
something
else
to
do
now
just
for
us
girls
said
alexia
i
do
know
said
polly
slowly
looking
up
at
her
we
ought
to
let
the
boys
come
in
oh
not
those
horrid
boys
said
alexia
impatiently
they
forever
hanging
around
and
i
like
once
in
a
while
to
have
something
by
ourselves
but
it
seems
too
bad
to
leave
them
out
said
polly
soberly
well
it
would
do
them
good
to
be
left
out
sometimes
declared
alexia
they
so
high
and
mighty
i
just
dearly
love
to
take
them
down
and
say
you
ca
come
into
this
she
tossed
her
fluffy
hair
till
the
long
light
braids
flew
out
triumphantly
why
ca
we
have
a
cooking
club
suggested
polly
after
a
minute
of
hard
thinking
ugh
alexia
twisted
up
her
face
oh
that
horrid
she
said
with
another
grimace
do
you
mean
learn
to
make
things
on
the
kitchen
range
yes
and
on
the
said
polly
flying
up
to
sit
straight
oh
it
would
be
elegant
alexia
she
cried
with
glowing
cheeks
well
i
ca
learn
said
alexia
so
that
some
small
comfort
for
in
a
and
i
guess
the
cook
here
would
fly
in
a
fit
to
see
me
come
into
the
kitchen
but
you
can
come
to
our
house
and

clasping
her
hands
why

reluctantly
and
beside
even
if

of

of

alexia
polly
sighed
and
clasped
her
hands
and
i
learn
to
make
your
cunning
little
biscuits
declared
alexia
suddenly
quite
as
if
she
had
proposed
the
plan
and
pushed
it
along
from
the
very
beginning
and
do
let
have
a
club
supper
soon
she
begged
there
a
carriage
coming
announced
little
filbert
from
his
chair
in
the
corner
oh

polly
springing
to
the
window
yes
mamsie

sent
for

alexia
i

oh

grumbled
alexia
awfully
disappointed
and
racing
after
her
why
you
ca
ever
go
in
all
this
rain
polly
pepper
polly
burst
out
into
a
laugh
just
look
there
she
pointed
to
the
patches
of
light
in
the
sky
gradually
growing
bigger
and
brighter
it
does
rain
a
single
drop
and
oh
alexia
look
look
the
rainbow
xxi
of
many
things
in
general
but
the
cooking
club
with
all
its
delights
was
started
yet
for
many
a
day
for
just
as
soon
as
polly
got
home
there
was
the
whole
story
of
the
morning
adventures
of
joel
and
larry
accident
to
fill
all
her
time
and
thoughts
and
then
jack
why
of
course
he
must
come
in
for
a
goodly
share
of
notice
for
joel
insisted
on
making
him
a
hero
to
be
willing
to
come
and
tell
king
of
his
misdemeanor
on
the
pond
and
doctor
fisher
had
said
the
arm
was
in
a
bad
way
the
trouble
being
increased
by
all
the
running
about
in
the
pelting
storm
that
jack
had
indulged
in
and
this
made
joel
nearly
frantic
dear
me
there
was
no
time
to
think
of
cooking
clubs
and
then
after
luncheon
came
a
little
note
from
sterling
brought
by
no
less
a
person
than
gibson
herself
who
in
her
staid
little
black
bonnet
and
gray
dress
and
white
apron
waited
for

said
gibson
the
light
of
pleasure
at

first
words
dying
down
a
bit
when

in
alarm
lest

stolen
on

sidled
off
on
the
other
side
van
polly
nipped
his
jacket
and
held
it
fast
seeing
which
percy
concluded
to

he
now
came

quietly
and

and
ran
and
sat
down
on
one
of
the
chairs
and
folded
her
hands
in
dismay
oh
we
will

cried
both
the
boys
quite
overcome
at
this
and
losing
sight
of
all
the
charms
that
were
awaiting
them
in
ben
room
they
precipitated
themselves
upon
her
but
where

out
with
doctor
fisher
in
his
gig

percy
dismally
changing

foot
to
the

in
great
distress

they

in
a
dudgeon
oh
van

him
all
to
himself

i
wo

joel

he
added
vindictively
oh
vanny
and
polly
went
close
to
him
and
put
her
cheek
to
his
just
think
what
a
dreadful
time
joel
had
out
there
on
the
pond
and
she
gave
a
little
shiver
hah

van
if
those
boys

declared
van
straightening
up
percy
percy
said
polly
warningly
turning
around
at
him
well
he
would
said
percy
uneasily
not
looking
at
her
you
know
he
would
polly
well

any
such
thing
said
polly
firmly
and
perhaps
he
would
either
no
i
would
protested
van
stoutly
since
polly
reinforced
him
and
you
just
as
mean
as
you
can
be
percy
whitney
to
say
so
boys
polly
drew
away
from
van
and
sank
down
on
her
chair
again
i
sha
have
anything
to
say
to
either
of
you
when
you
say
such
dreadful
things
and
she
folded
her
hands
sorrowfully
in
her
lap
and
looked
straight
ahead
at
the
opposite
wall
oh
we
wo
we
wo
cried
both
boys
running
over
to
her
polly
we

percy
and
van
promised
and
pretty
soon
the
wide
hall
resounded
with
merry
peals
of
laughter
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
polly
jumping
to
her
feet
in
dismay
what
the
matter
cried
both
boys
tumbling
back
in
astonishment
just
look
what
i
done
polly
was
wringing
her
hands
now
and
presented
a
picture
of
distress
what
what
polly
they
crowded
up
to
her
again
why
i
forgotten
i
was
to
go
at
once
to
sterling
and
she
been
waiting
if
joel

him
over
the
last
words

back
in
a
little
shout
for
polly

me
exclaimed
percy
discontentedly
losing
all
thought
of
the
attractions
in
ben
room
now
polly
will
be
gone
all
the
whole
afternoon
i
know
let
tag
her
proposed
van
cheerfully
not
caring
to
get
upstairs
first
since
percy
was
going
to
race
with
him
i
will
come
on
no
no
said
percy
in
alarm
she
wo
like
that
think
of
something
else
i
thought
of
one
thing
and
you
wo
do
it
said
van
composedly
sitting
down
on
the
very
chair
polly
had
left
now
it
your
turn
but
it
was
no
good
that
old
thing
you
thought
of
retorted
percy
in
disdain
no
one
could
do
it
i
thought
it
out
anyway
repeated
van
obstinately
and
you
would
do
it
so
i
not
going
to
think
up
anything
else
till
you
have
thought
something
percy
whitney
well
you
need
be
so
cross
said
percy
sourly
and
squaring
up
to
his
chair
i
not
cross
contradicted
van
looking
up
at
him
with
a
very
red
face
yes
you
are
just
as
cross
as
a
said
percy
trying
to
think
of
the
worst
thing
he
had
encountered
and
quite
pleased
as
he
saw
its
effect
on
van
you
shall
just
take
that
back
percy
whitney
declared
van
hopping
out
of
his
chair
and
doubling
up
his
small
fists
i
not
a
percy
edged
off
with
a
sharp
lookout
for
the
fists
i
did
say
so
yes
you
did
said
van
crossly
you
said
just
that
very
thing
percy
whitney
and
i
not
a
i
said
you
were
as
cross
as
one
said
percy
wishing
he
had
been
quite
as
free
with
his
comparisons
and
moving
off
to
a
convenient
corner
well
that
just
the
same
said
van
advancing
and
polly
transcriber
note
this
page
in
our
print
copy
was
obscured
by
an
ink
blot
the
words
in
brackets
are
those
that
we
have
supplied
based
on
context
and
those
letters
that
were
visible
at
the
mention
of
polly
percy
stopped
suddenly
drew
a
long
breath
and
never
thought
of
the
corner
again
why
we
promised
her
he
gasped
i
forgot
all
about
it
down
went
van
little
fist
so
we
did
he
said
gloomily
and
both
boys
crept
off
together
to
the
same
corner
percy
had
selected
for
himself
whatever
shall
we
do
now
breathed
percy
quite
lost
in
his
dismal
reflections
we
stopped
said
van
as
something
to
be
offered
with
a
grain
of
hope
but
we
did
a
lot
before
we
stopped
said
percy
a
deep
gloom
had
settled
over
his
countenance
and
he
would
look
at
van
oh
dear
me
van
fidgeted
about
for
a
minute
well
i
do
know
he
said
twisting
his
hands
oh
dear
me
why
you
might
say
i
not
a
he
cried
cheerfully
at
last
and
fairly
hugging
percy
in
his
delight
so
i
might
said
percy
well
pleased
but
i
did
say
you
a
i
said
you
were
as
cross
as
a
well
you
might
say
i
not
as
cross
as
a
then
said
van
determined
to
fix
it
some
way
so
percy
said
it
and
then
the
two
brothers
plunged
out
of
doors
without
a
thought
of
the
formalities
of
any
plan
but
it
was
van
who
furnished
it
after
all
let
go
down
and
see
candace
he
said
oh
yes
let
cried
percy
then
he
stopped
short
and
began
to
laugh
what
the
matter
van
twitched
his
sleeve
nothing
said
percy
so
relieved
he
had
said
what
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
you
done
it
after
all
and
told
something
for
us
to
do
well
then
come
on
cried
van
with
a
harder
twitch
so
they
set
off
at
a
lively
pace
for
the
delights
of
candace
little
shop
meanwhile
polly
was
sorrowfully
confessing
to
sterling
why
she
was
late
and
explaining
all
the
reason
that
joel
could
accompany
her
and
the
whole
story
of
the
morning
affair
on
the
pond
as
gathered
from
jack
for
joel
had
told
a
word
of
the
encounter
with
the
crowd
of
rough
boys
had
to
be
gone
over
with
before
sterling
could
open
her
budget
of
news
and
her
wonderful
plan
for
the
comfort
committee
she
was
just
beginning
on
it
i
do
like
that
name
so
very
much
sighed
polly
she
was
on
a
little
cricket
by
the
side
of
the
lounge
her
hands
resting
on
the
gay
do
you
cried
sterling
in
great
satisfaction
it
expresses
so
much
polly
i
am
so
very
glad
that
you
like
it
master
joel
pepper
is
coming
down
the
street
said
gibson
guilty
of
interrupting
for
she
knew
how
anxious
her
mistress
was
to
see
joel
shall
i
call
him
in
do
by
all
means
said
sterling
while
polly
cried
oh
i
am
so
glad
so
gibson
knocked
on
the
window
and
beckoned
to
joel
that
he
was
wanted
then
she
hurried
down
to
the
big
front
door
to
let
him
in
there
was
a
funny
little
noise
over
the
stairs
as
if
there
were
more
than
one
pair
of
feet
which
was
soon
explained
by
joel
bursting
in
dragging
another
boy
after
him
who
had
his
arm
done
up
in
a
sling
it
jack
he
said
by
way
of
introduction
oh
joel
cried
polly
springing
to
her
feet
in
consternation
yes
and
now
what
is
it
joel
advanced
to
the
invalid
couch
ready
for
business
i
very
glad
to
see
jack
said
sterling
with
a
smile
putting
out
her
soft
white
hand
to
the
boy
who
was
gazing
at
the
doorway
through
which
he
had
come
as
if
nothing
would
please
him
so
much
as
to
go
through
it
again
this
time
on
the
way
back
you
might
get
a
chair
joel
for
your
friend
and
another
for
yourself
suggested
sterling
i
will
i
will
cried
joel
well
pleased
to
have
something
to
do
and
dragging
up
the
first
one
he
could
find
i
going
to
sit
on
the
carpet
suiting
the
action
to
the
words
well
you
see
sterling
without
more
ado
began
at
once
on
her
plan
polly
was
by
this
time
back
on
her
cricket
very
much
relieved
to
find
that
it
was
so
very
dreadful
after
all
to
have
jack
there
since
sterling
seemed
to
like
it
there
nothing
helps
a
boy
who
is
to
be
shut
up
in
the
house
for
a
long
time
quite
so
much
as
to
have
the
other
boys
who
can
go
out
to
play
think
of
him
and
plan
for
his
comfort
that
so
sterling
looked
at
her
little
audience
keenly
yes
said
two
of
them
jack
was
so
scared
at
finding
himself
where
he
had
never
supposed
he
could
be
in
the
stately
brownstone
mansion
that
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
carpet
not
daring
to
move
as
for
speech
it
was
quite
beyond
him
well
now
that
lawrence
keep
has
gotten
hurt
i
think
it
will
be
a
very
good
plan
to
have
a
comfort
committee
to
look
out
for
him
what
can
we
do
for
him
cried
joel
very
much
excited
and
jumping
up
from
the
carpet
joel
do
sit
down
said
polly
quite
ashamed
and
pulling
him
by
the
jacket
joel
very
unwillingly
slid
back
to
his
place
on
the
carpet
and
fastened
his
black
eyes
on
sterling
face
well
there
are
so
many
things
to
do
for
a
boy
who
wo
be
very
sick
but
must
be
shut
up
in
the
house
said
sterling
that
really
it
takes
time
even
to
think
of
them
all
what
are
some
of
them
burst
out
joel
pulling
the
in
his
eagerness
joel
joel
said
polly
here
are
some
of
them
said
sterling
that
i
told
the
boys
this
morning
when
they
were
in
here
you
might
cut
out
the
funny
things
in
the
magazines
and
newspapers
the
pictures
and
the
stories
and
send
him
so
nice
to
have
little
reminders
to
pass
away
the
time
what
else
well
i
did
tell
them
that
but
there
are
letters
you
might
write
him
ugh
joel
made
a
wry
face
i
do
like
to
write
letters
he
said
bluntly
joel
said
polly
again
perhaps
that
is
the
very
reason
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
do
it
said
sterling
with
a
smile
at
any
rate
it
would
please
lawrence
i
think
well
then
there
are
conundrums
you
can
surely
think
up
something
of
that
sort
that
will
amuse
him
and
puzzles
now
strange
to
say
jack
had
a
good
head
for
these
things
and
without
thinking
where
he
was
he
blurted
out
i
know
a
lot
of
joel
whirled
around
on
the
carpet
and
stared
at
him
as
did
polly
from
her
cricket
but
sterling
only
smiled
that
good
she
said
in
approval
now
you
see
you
can
help
us
out
a
good
deal
nodding
at
him
but
jack
with
a
wild
glance
at
the
door
as
he
came
to
himself
was
beyond
conundrums
as
he
thought
of
what
he
done
tell
some
of
jack
cried
joel
eagerly
emerging
from
his
surprise
what
are
they
jack
tell
some
not
now
said
sterling
interposing
jack
is
going
to
write
them
out
and
they
will
be
sent
in
as
his
contribution
to
lawrence
sent
in
to
larry
keep
big
house
almost
as
grand
as
the
one
jack
sat
in
now
by
him
a
little
grocer
son
doing
business
over
at
the
south
end
he
could
believe
his
ears
and
to
assist
them
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
stared
at
the
person
making
the
announcement
evidently
she
meant
it
and
the
more
he
gazed
at
her
face
the
better
he
liked
it
but
he
did
dare
to
stare
long
so
he
concluded
to
transfer
his
attention
from
it
to
the
carpet
we
are
getting
on
so
well
said
sterling
and
her
tone
was
very
cheery
that
i
am
really
quite
hopeful
that
lawrence
may
be
amused
by
all
that
we
are
to
do
for
him
and
now
before
we
go
any
further
in
our
plan
suppose
we
take
a
little
comfort
ourselves
and
she
laughed
a
gay
little
laugh
that
would
have
sounded
badly
as
polly
own
gibson
she
called
out
came
gibson
from
the
little
room
next
will
you
bring
us
a
tray
of
some
of
the
nice
things
you
always
can
get
up
gibson
said
her
mistress
i
am
really
hungry
and
i
know
these
young
people
must
be
they
run
about
so
i
am
declared
joel
in
great
satisfaction
at
hearing
the
tray
mentioned
and
bobbing
his
black
hair
awfully
hungry
oh
joel
said
polly
if
you
knew
polly
said
sterling
with
a
laugh
what
a
pleasure
it
is
to
me
to
hear
a
hungry
boy
say
so
up
here
you
would
be
very
glad
to
let
him
you
ca
think
looking
around
on
the
three
what
good
you
are
doing
me
really
your
work
as
a
comfort
committee
has
begun
already
xxii
rachel
visit
to
miss
parrott
rachel
ran
blindly
up
the
garret
stairs
of
the
parsonage
and
threw
herself
down
on
the
top
her
blue
checked
apron
over
her
head
oh
i
ca
i
ca
she
screamed
rachel
the
minister
wife
called
gently
after
her
but
rachel
stormed
on
oh
i
ca
dear
me
i
ca
so
henderson
mounted
the
stairs
and
sat
down
on
the
top
one
and
took
rachel
hands
nervously
beating
together
my
child
you
must
listen
to
me
it
was
said
very
quietly
but
rachel
knew
by
this
time
what
the
parsonage
people
meant
when
they
said
a
thing
so
she
answered
meekly
in
a
muffled
voice
because
of
the
apron
over
her
head
yes
take
down
your
apron
said
henderson
down
fell
the
apron
disclosing
a
face
of
so
much
distress
that
for
a
moment
the
heart
of
the
parson
wife
failed
her
but
it
must
be
done
my
child
she
began
very
gently
it
is
best
that
you
should
go
to
see
miss
parrott
she
will
be
a
good
friend
to
you
i
do
want
no
friends
said
rachel
doggedly
in
her
distress
relapsing
into
her
old
disregard
of
the
rules
of
speech
no
more
i
got
her
ah
child
that
is
not
a
wise
way
to
talk
said
henderson
shaking
her
head
one
can
not
have
too
many
friends
she
be
too
many
said
rachel
that
old
woman
that
came
the
other
day
in
that
carriage
all
full
of
bones
you
must
not
talk
so
dear
she
is
a
very
fine
woman
now
rachel
she
has
asked
to
have
you
spend
the
day
there
and
we
have
promised
that
you
shall
go
there
was
an
awful
pause
a
big
over
in
the
corner
under
the
rafters
was
making
a
final
decision
to
explore
the
filmy
lace
web
beneath
the
window
where
a
fat
old
spider
had
been
patiently
waiting
for
him
and
he
gave
his
last
buzz
of
freedom
before
he
hopped
in
this
was
all
the
sound
that
broke
the
silence
rachel
held
her
breath
and
fixed
her
black
eyes
at
a
point
straight
ahead
positively
sure
if
she
withdrew
her
gaze
she
would
burst
out
crying
so
you
will
be
ready
to
go
at
ten
rachel
for
miss
parrott
will
send
for
you
then
henderson
was
saying
and
in
a
minute
more
the
parson
wife
was
going
down
the
garret
stairs
rachel
with
a
heart
full
of
woe
slowly
following
leaving
the
big
garret
to
the
fat
old
spider
who
was
busily
weaving
her
silken
threads
in
glee
over
her
prisoner
and
rachel
woeful
face
was
more
than
matched
by
the
countenances
of
the
two
boys
of
the
parson
family
who
were
not
at
all
pleased
that
the
companion
sent
to
them
by
fisher
and
who
had
turned
out
surprisingly
just
to
their
liking
should
be
suddenly
torn
away
from
them
even
for
a
single
day
and
they
followed
disapprovingly
around
hanging
upon
all
the
preparations
for
the
momentous
visit
with
a
very
bad
influence
upon
rachel
endeavor
to
control
herself
seeing
which
their
mother
sent
them
off
on
an
errand
to
grandma
bascom
so
when
the
ancient
carriage
with
its
coachman
who
rejoiced
in
the
name
of
simmons
made
its
appearance
there
was
no
one
to
see
rachel
off
save
the
patron
wife
the
minister
himself
being
away
on
a
call
lo
a
sick
parishioner
rachel
went
steadily
down
the
walk
between
the
feeling
her
heart
sink
at
each
step
henderson
well
in
advance
was
down
at
the
roadside
to
help
her
in
with
a
last
bit
of
good
advice
simmons
said
the
parson
wife
pleasantly
madam
simmons
touched
his
hat
and
spoke
with
the
air
of
state
for
he
kept
his
english
ways
secretly
the
parson
wife
was
always
quite
impressed
by
them
and
she
looked
at
rachel
for
some
sign
to
that
effect
but
the
child
was
scowling
and
biting
her
thin
lips
and
she
suffered
henderson
to
assist
her
into
the
wide
old
vehicle
without
any
further
change
of
expression
when
once
in
she
gazed
around
then
leaned
forward
on
the
slippery
old
green
leather
seat
ca
peletiah
come
she
gasped
there
lots
o
room
no
said
henderson
now
be
a
good
girl
all
her
fears
returning
as
she
saw
rachel
face
simmons
starting
up
the
horses
that
although
an
old
pair
yet
liked
to
set
off
with
a
flourish
the
movement
bounced
rachel
violently
against
the
back
of
her
seat
and
knocked
her
bonnet
over
her
face
this
gave
her
something
to
think
of
and
changed
her
terror
to
a
deep
displeasure
when
the
drive
was
ended
therefore
and
the
brougham
after
its
progress
through
an
avenue
of
fine
old
trees
was
brought
to
a
standstill
before
the
ancestral
mansion
where
miss
parrott
father
and
grandfather
had
lived
before
her
the
visitor
was
in
no
condition
to
enjoy
the
pleasures
thrust
upon
her
miss
parrott
in
the
stiff
black
silk
gown
that
she
had
worn
the
day
when
she
called
at
the
parsonage
met
her
on
the
big
stone
steps
she
put
out
a
hand
in
a
long
black
lace
mitt
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
child
she
said
in
hospitality
but
no
hospitality
or
any
other
had
a
pleasant
effect
on
rachel
she
gave
a
glance
up
and
around
the
big
gloomy
gray
stone
house
with
a
wild
thought
of
rushing
down
the
avenue
and
home
to
the
parsonage
it
is
a
pleasant
place
is
it
observed
miss
parrott
with
complacent
memory
of
always
living
in
the
grandest
homestead
for
several
counties
no
said
rachel
promptly
miss
parrott
started
and
gave
a
little
gasp
then
reflecting
it
was
not
in
accordance
with
fine
manners
to
notice
any
such
slip
on
the
part
of
guests
she
led
the
way
into
the
mansion
simmons
much
shocked
actually
forgot
himself
so
far
as
to
scratch
his
head
as
he
drove
off
to
the
stables
and
he
did
get
over
it
all
day
perhaps
you
would
like
a
little
refreshment
suggested
miss
parrott
when
the
child
bonnet
off
she
was
seated
on
the
edge
of
a
stiff
chair
she
could
think
of
anything
else
to
say
and
as
she
usually
offered
it
to
her
friends
at
the
end
of
their
long
drives
when
they
called
upon
her
it
seemed
a
happy
thing
to
do
now
especially
as
black
eyes
were
fastened
upon
her
in
a
manner
extremely
uncomfortable
for
the
person
gazed
at
as
rachel
did
know
in
the
least
what
refreshment
meant
she
stared
on
without
a
word
and
miss
parrott
pulling
with
more
vigor
than
was
her
wont
a
long
red
worsted
cord
that
hung
down
by
the
piano
a
stately
butler
made
his
appearance
quicker
than
usual
took
his
directions
from
his
mistress
and
after
regarding
the
small
figure
perched
on
one
of
the
ancestral
parrott
chairs
with
extreme
disfavor
he
silently
withdrew
presently
in
he
came
his
head
well
thrown
back
and
bearing
a
huge
silver
tray
on
it
were
a
decanter
two
little
glasses
and
a
plate
of
very
thin
seed
cakes
he
deposited
this
on
a
table
which
he
drew
up
in
front
of
his
mistress
and
with
another
glance
which
he
intended
to
be
very
withering
cast
upon
rachel
but
which
she
did
see
at
all
he
departed
now
my
dear
said
miss
parrott
in
a
lighter
tone
feeling
quite
in
her
element
while
serving
refreshments
in
such
an
elegant
way
you
must
be
very
hungry
she
poured
out
a
glassful
from
the
decanter
and
getting
out
of
her
chair
she
took
up
the
plate
of
seed
cakes
and
advanced
to
the
small
figure
here
child
rachel
took
the
little
glass
but
had
no
sooner
felt
it
within
her
hand
than
she
gave
a
loud
scream
take
it
away
it
smells
just
like
gran
pushing
it
from
her
it
knocked
against
the
plate
of
seed
cakes
miss
parrott
was
proffering
and
together
they
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
crash
in
hurried
the
butler
i
do
know
what
can
be
the
matter
miss
parrott
was
gasping
her
hand
on
her
heart
as
she
leaned
against
one
of
the
ancient
cabinets
of
which
the
apartment
seemed
to
be
full
it
smells
just
like
gran
rachel
was
repeating
with
flashing
eyes
oh
how
dare
you
give
it
to
me
she
was
standing
over
the
wreck
of
the
priceless
china
and
glass
which
as
no
such
accidents
had
been
recorded
in
the
family
miss
parrott
had
continued
to
use
in
the
entertainment
of
her
guests
you
bad
child
you
exclaimed
the
butler
seizing
her
arm
and
gone
almost
out
of
his
senses
at
the
sight
of
the
ruin
of
such
ancient
treasures
i
not
bad
cried
rachel
turning
on
him
and
stamping
her
foot
bad
that
woman
there
for
giving
me
what
smells
just
like
gran
i
ca
make
her
out
declared
the
butler
eyeing
her
as
he
released
her
arm
and
stepped
back
toward
his
mistress
and
that
what
makes
people
drunk
went
on
rachel
pointing
an
angry
finger
at
the
wet
spot
where
the
liquid
from
the
decanter
was
slowly
oozing
into
the
velvet
carpet
the
butler
turned
an
outraged
countenance
on
which
a
dull
red
was
spreading
over
to
his
mistress
you
would
better
go
out
hooper
said
miss
parrott
faintly
and
holding
fast
to
the
cabinet
i
afraid
to
leave
you
madam
said
hooper
she
ai
fit
that
creature
pointing
to
rachel
to
be
here
she
may
fly
at
you
i
put
her
out
at
once
you
may
leave
the
apartment
hooper
said
miss
parrott
regaining
some
of
her
dignity
by
a
mighty
effort
i
not
in
the
least
afraid
but
her
looks
belied
her
words
or
at
any
rate
the
old
thought
so
and
he
made
bold
to
remonstrate
again
let
me
put
her
out
madam
he
begged
i
call
the
gardeners
oh
no
no
protested
miss
parrott
coming
rapidly
to
her
that
would
never
do
in
all
the
world
leave
the
room
hooper
this
last
was
said
so
exactly
like
his
mistress
at
her
best
that
the
butler
obeyed
it
making
a
wide
circuit
as
he
passed
rachel
who
still
stood
the
picture
of
wrath
over
the
broken
china
and
glass
not
a
word
was
said
for
some
minutes
outside
polly
the
old
parrot
was
scolding
vociferously
and
the
tall
clock
was
ticking
away
for
clear
life
hooper
his
ear
first
and
then
his
eye
glued
to
the
keyhole
was
vainly
endeavoring
to
find
out
what
was
passing
in
the
at
last
rachel
drew
a
long
breath
i
sorry
i
broke
your
things
and
she
awkwardly
pushed
the
bits
with
her
shoe
oh
that
no
matter
said
miss
parrott
feeling
astonished
at
herself
for
the
words
but
you
said
such
dreadful
things
i
can
never
forget
that
she
drew
a
long
breath
no
matter
that
she
broke
those
beautiful
things
the
whole
truth
flashed
upon
rachel
and
although
the
smell
of
the
hated
stuff
was
even
yet
dragging
back
to
her
all
the
memory
of
her
low
condition
of
life
through
such
childhood
as
she
had
known
over
and
above
it
all
was
quickly
rising
the
conviction
that
for
this
unpardonable
misdemeanor
she
would
be
sent
back
to
the
city
and
awful
thought
perhaps
to
gran
she
set
her
teeth
together
hard
and
clenched
her
thin
hands
as
they
hung
by
her
side
yes
i
say
it
is
no
matter
repeated
miss
parrott
not
suffering
herself
to
glance
at
the
wreck
of
her
ancestral
treasures
but
oh
child
why
did
you
say
such
dreadful
things
she
still
clung
to
the
cabinet
shocked
out
of
one
tradition
of
her
family
as
if
she
must
still
hold
to
its
and
honored
furnishings
rachel
gave
her
a
swift
glance
you
do
care
you
crying
she
exclaimed
aghast
at
the
tears
running
over
the
wrinkled
face
not
about
that
but
the
things
you
said
i
did
mean
to
do
you
harm
miss
parrott
did
not
attempt
to
deny
the
tears
and
brushed
them
off
with
a
trembling
hand
you
ai
hurt
me
cried
rachel
stumbling
across
the
floor
with
an
awful
feeling
at
her
heart
to
see
this
stiff
old
woman
cry
oh
whatever
your
name
is
do
i
go
home
and
the
minister
may
send
me
back
to
gran
an
she
may
beat
me
do
cry
she
seized
the
heavy
black
silk
in
its
front
breadth
and
held
on
tightly
the
butler
having
at
this
minute
his
eye
at
the
keyhole
now
rushed
in
unable
to
bear
the
sight
to
be
met
by
miss
parrott
her
withered
face
flaming
behind
her
tears
do
you
go
directly
out
hooper
and
remain
away
until
you
are
called
he
never
knew
how
he
got
out
and
this
time
the
keyhole
was
unobstructed
were
you
beaten
you
poor
little
thing
was
this
miss
parrott
bending
over
rachel
shaking
shoulders
and
hands
clutching
the
silk
gown
oh
dear
dear
tai
no
matter
mumbled
rachel
i
do
care
only
do
let
me
go
back
she
shook
in
terror
and
crouched
down
to
the
floor
never
said
miss
parrott
firmly
all
the
blood
in
her
body
seemed
to
be
in
her
wrinkled
face
and
her
eyes
shone
as
had
those
of
her
father
the
old
judge
when
befriending
some
poor
unfortunate
you
shall
never
go
back
child
do
be
afraid
but
rachel
still
shivered
there
were
the
broken
bits
of
china
and
glass
on
the
floor
back
of
her
and
the
minister
and
his
wife
must
be
told
of
the
awful
accident
and
what
they
would
do
with
her
why
of
course
no
one
could
tell
the
thin
wrinkled
fingers
on
which
blazed
many
rings
that
had
been
her
mother
before
her
were
tremblingly
smoothing
rachel
neatly
braided
hair
and
as
if
she
thought
what
was
passing
beneath
them
miss
parrott
broke
out
quickly
i
shall
never
speak
of
it
of
the
breaking
of
those
articles
child
so
no
one
will
know
it
but
ourselves
never
tell
gasped
rachel
lifting
her
head
in
astonishment
and
scarcely
believing
her
ears
of
course
not
declared
miss
parrott
in
scorn
so
do
not
be
afraid
any
longer
but
get
up
and
dry
your
eyes
for
at
this
announcement
tears
had
gushed
out
and
she
sobbed
as
if
her
heart
would
break
for
answer
rachel
flew
to
her
feet
and
without
any
warning
and
astonishing
herself
equally
with
the
recipient
she
threw
her
arms
around
miss
parrott
thin
neck
in
among
all
the
ancient
laces
with
which
she
delighted
to
adorn
it
and
hugged
it
convulsively
taken
unawares
miss
parrott
could
utter
no
word
and
rachel
clung
to
her
and
sobbed
but
the
old
ears
had
heard
what
had
been
sounded
in
them
for
many
a
long
day
and
forgotten
were
wasted
heirlooms
and
broken
treasures
i
love
you
rachel
had
said
hugging
her
tumultuously
xxiii
the
old
parrott
homestead
come
child
miss
parrott
drew
herself
out
of
rachel
clinging
arms
what
should
she
do
now
to
divert
this
little
girl
from
her
terror
and
distress
she
was
sorely
put
to
it
for
the
answer
she
gathered
up
the
nervous
hands
in
one
of
her
own
and
led
the
way
out
into
the
wide
hall
hung
with
ancestral
portraits
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
my
own
room
she
said
suddenly
rachel
did
know
the
wonderful
condescension
of
this
plan
for
her
amusement
but
she
clung
to
the
long
thin
fingers
and
presently
she
was
seated
on
a
cricket
covered
with
tambour
work
and
watching
miss
movements
about
the
spacious
apartment
move
your
cricket
over
here
child
miss
parrott
was
unlocking
what
looked
to
rachel
eyes
like
a
big
cupboard
that
stood
out
from
the
wall
it
had
little
panes
of
glass
all
with
strips
of
white
wood
across
its
face
and
a
set
of
drawers
beneath
and
as
rachel
obediently
carried
the
cricket
over
and
set
it
down
where
miss
parrott
indicated
her
chief
attention
was
still
upon
this
curious
cupboard
and
what
miss
parrott
was
doing
in
it
for
the
door
now
stood
open
rachel
leaned
forward
on
her
cricket
and
rested
her
hands
on
her
knees
on
the
shelves
was
such
an
array
of
articles
that
to
the
child
gaze
nothing
stood
out
distinctly
as
an
object
to
lavish
one
sole
attention
upon
but
miss
parrott
made
early
choice
and
lifting
out
a
big
doll
from
one
of
the
lower
shelves
she
laid
it
in
rachel
lap
i
used
to
play
with
it
she
said
softly
rachel
looked
down
upon
the
doll
in
her
lap
it
was
long
and
hard
and
angular
as
to
body
and
its
face
was
a
dull
white
except
some
patches
of
pink
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
cheeks
showing
the
rest
of
the
coloring
to
have
been
worn
away
its
eyes
were
staring
up
into
rachel
in
such
an
expressionless
unpleasant
manner
that
she
involuntarily
turned
away
her
own
her
name
is
priscilla
said
miss
parrott
looking
down
at
rachel
which
called
her
to
herself
and
the
necessity
of
attention
to
these
efforts
to
amuse
her
yes
said
rachel
now
i
do
suppose
you
know
how
much
i
loved
this
doll
said
miss
parrott
turning
her
back
on
the
cupboard
to
draw
up
a
chair
opposite
rachel
and
seat
herself
upon
it
but
i
used
to
take
her
to
bed
with
me
nights
did
you
said
rachel
beginning
to
finger
the
doll
with
sudden
interest
yes
and
i
made
her
clothes
and
talked
to
her
and
sometimes
i
called
her
said
miss
parrott
quite
gone
in
remembrance
oh
said
rachel
you
see
she
was
all
i
had
i
was
the
youngest
and
my
real
sister
was
married
and
away
and
my
brothers
were
men
when
i
was
a
little
girl
oh
said
rachel
again
and
so
i
had
to
make
believe
that
priscilla
was
alive
said
miss
parrott
her
eyes
glowing
with
remembrance
of
her
childhood
brought
so
singularly
near
on
this
morning
i
really
had
to
rachel
i
got
a
child
said
rachel
growing
suddenly
communicative
and
looking
up
from
the
old
doll
to
watch
the
effect
of
her
announcement
have
you
dear
responded
miss
parrott
quite
pleased
at
the
bright
face
from
which
the
last
tear
had
been
wiped
away
yes
my
phronsie
gave
her
to
me
and
she
sleeps
with
me
said
rachel
in
great
satisfaction
i
suppose
she
is
very
much
like
priscilla
observed
miss
parrott
oh
no
she
is
declared
rachel
promptly
turning
her
mind
again
to
the
ancient
doll
my
child
is
pretty
and
she
shuts
her
eyes
she
is
a
bit
like
yours
well
priscilla
was
always
pretty
to
me
said
miss
parrott
astonished
that
she
felt
so
little
the
slight
to
her
child
well
now
rachel
we
will
put
the
doll
aside
you
may
lay
it
on
the
bed
and
then
come
back
here
rachel
got
off
from
her
cricket
and
went
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
apartment
my
what
a
funny
bed
she
exclaimed
using
her
eyes
to
their
utmost
to
see
as
much
of
the
canopy
with
its
tester
of
blue
and
white
chintz
the
four
posts
beneath
and
the
counterpane
executed
in
honeycomb
pattern
miss
parrott
exploring
her
cupboard
to
get
out
something
else
with
which
to
entertain
rachel
did
not
hear
her
so
she
slowly
returned
walking
backward
to
observe
as
much
of
this
queer
article
of
furniture
as
the
time
allowed
in
this
way
she
fell
over
the
cricket
dear
me
exclaimed
miss
parrott
pulling
her
head
out
of
the
cupboard
did
you
hurt
yourself
child
no
said
rachel
getting
up
with
a
very
red
face
and
exceedingly
ashamed
i
do
believe
i
broke
it
she
set
the
cricket
up
in
its
proper
position
and
anxiously
examined
it
all
over
oh
no
said
miss
parrott
reassuringly
the
cricket
is
not
harmed
see
here
rachel
she
held
in
her
hand
a
long
string
of
little
irregular
things
that
dangled
as
she
turned
toward
her
i
am
going
to
put
these
on
your
neck
now
stand
still
child
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
words
something
snapped
with
a
little
click
under
rachel
chin
rachel
looked
down
quickly
at
the
queer
little
red
things
hanging
over
her
breast
i
used
to
wear
them
when
i
was
a
little
girl
very
much
smaller
than
you
said
miss
parrott
her
head
on
one
side
and
falling
back
to
see
the
effect
what
are
they
asked
rachel
not
daring
to
lay
a
finger
on
them
and
holding
her
breath
at
the
idea
of
being
within
the
magnificent
circle
of
miss
parrott
early
adornments
red
coral
beads
said
miss
parrott
smiling
at
the
nice
contrast
between
the
necklace
and
the
dark
little
face
above
now
child
you
are
going
to
wear
them
whenever
you
come
to
visit
me
and
as
long
as
you
stay
and
that
means
they
will
not
come
off
till
for
you
are
to
sleep
here
i
have
any
nightgown
said
rachel
who
by
this
time
liked
to
stay
well
enough
but
seeing
here
an
insuperable
objection
that
easily
managed
said
miss
parrott
quickly
i
shall
send
a
note
to
the
parsonage
saying
you
will
stay
and
at
the
mention
of
note
rachel
suddenly
collapsed
and
a
look
of
terror
spread
over
her
face
oh
i
forgot
she
cried
why
what
is
the
matter
child
demanded
miss
parrott
in
great
concern
i
must
go
and
get
it
said
rachel
wildly
and
dashing
blindly
off
she
left
miss
parrott
standing
in
front
of
her
ancestral
cupboard
holding
her
childish
treasures
to
rush
over
the
long
and
winding
back
stairs
at
their
end
she
found
herself
hopelessly
entangled
in
an
array
of
back
passages
and
little
apartments
from
which
run
as
she
would
she
could
never
seem
to
find
the
right
exit
her
progress
was
noted
with
indignation
and
contempt
by
as
many
of
the
old
retainers
in
the
parrott
service
as
could
be
gathered
at
short
notice
and
their
calls
to
her
to
leave
the
premises
accompanied
by
sundry
shakings
of
a
long
crash
towel
in
the
hands
of
the
cook
only
impeded
rachel
hope
of
success
i
do
know
the
way
out
she
cried
at
last
finding
herself
in
a
big
closet
whose
door
being
open
she
fondly
trusted
would
allow
her
passage
out
into
the
free
air
well
is
here
said
an
angry
voice
and
the
brandishing
of
a
big
iron
spoon
made
rachel
beat
a
hasty
retreat
this
time
into
the
back
hall
miss
parrott
was
just
descending
the
stairs
her
stiff
black
silk
skirt
held
high
before
she
set
foot
in
the
servants
quarters
child
child
she
said
in
reproach
what
the
matter
oh
i
lost
the
note
i
mean
i
forgot
it
rachel
flew
to
her
and
wailed
it
all
out
she
crying
that
bad
girl
is
all
over
mistress
front
breadth
announced
joanna
the
parlor
maid
through
the
little
window
of
the
butler
pantry
la
me
ejaculated
the
cook
raising
her
hands
and
the
crash
towel
to
think
of
our
mistress
so
demeaning
herself
what
note
cried
miss
parrott
in
great
bewilderment
rachel
stop
crying
at
once
and
speak
plainly
what
note
do
you
mean
the
one
henderson
gave
me
cried
rachel
i
must
go
and
get
it
but
i
do
know
the
way
out
to
give
to
me
did
henderson
tell
you
to
give
it
to
me
asked
miss
parrott
beginning
to
see
light
yes
oh
please
let
me
out
begged
rachel
i
left
it
in
the
carriage
ah
well
then
we
go
out
this
way
and
there
turning
to
the
left
was
the
passage
down
which
rachel
had
plunged
twice
before
and
at
its
end
a
small
green
door
that
when
opened
led
out
through
an
arbor
overrun
with
creepers
to
a
short
cut
to
the
stables
now
then
miss
parrott
gathered
up
the
train
of
her
black
silk
gown
and
put
it
over
her
arm
then
in
full
view
of
the
latticed
window
of
the
kitchen
and
scullery
department
she
sallied
forth
across
the
greensward
to
the
stables
beyond
rachel
brown
hand
tucked
in
her
own
laws
a
me
it
was
the
scullery
maid
who
screamed
this
out
she
got
on
miss
parrott
coral
beads
you
a
ninny
cried
the
cook
turning
on
her
in
disdain
go
back
to
your
pots
and
kettles
ann
whatever
would
she
have
to
do
with
the
mistress
beads
it
some
old
string
you
see
around
her
neck
it
tell
you
it
miss
parrott
red
beads
declared
ann
stoutly
she
might
be
sent
back
to
her
work
among
the
pots
and
kettles
but
she
would
stick
fast
to
her
tale
i
seen
when
i
went
up
to
miss
parrott
room
with
the
bellows
i
cleaned
this
very
morning
through
the
little
winders
to
her
cupboard
an
i
know
anywhere
the
cook
stamped
her
foot
shaking
the
crash
towel
which
she
still
retained
and
ann
withdrew
to
those
inner
precincts
that
were
considered
her
department
meanwhile
miss
parrott
was
talking
to
simmons
who
touching
his
hat
respectfully
when
he
saw
her
approach
now
came
up
to
await
her
commands
have
the
goodness
to
open
the
brougham
door
simmons
said
miss
parrott
going
through
the
carriage
house
to
the
corner
where
that
ancient
vehicle
was
stored
simmons
obeyed
wonderingly
with
an
eye
askance
at
rachel
by
the
other
side
of
miss
parrott
eagerly
pressing
forward
now
jump
in
said
miss
parrott
but
this
command
was
not
needed
for
rachel
was
already
within
the
family
coach
and
prowling
around
on
the
old
green
leather
cushion
and
over
the
floor
with
both
nervous
hands
it
is
oh
yes
it
is
and
up
she
came
red
and
shining
to
hold
out
a
small
white
envelope
miss
parrott
leaned
against
the
brougham
and
broke
the
seal
rachel
her
whole
heart
in
one
glad
thrill
of
joy
made
little
sign
except
to
heave
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
that
the
note
had
been
found
simmons
seeing
no
excuse
for
lingering
further
went
back
to
one
of
the
carriages
to
go
through
the
form
of
inspecting
its
exterior
while
he
still
kept
an
eye
employed
in
the
direction
of
his
mistress
dear
miss
parrott
so
the
note
ran
i
really
do
not
think
it
is
wise
to
ask
rachel
to
remain
over
night
i
will
explain
later
another
time
perhaps
she
may
do
so
yours
respectfully
almira
henderson
dear
me
exclaimed
miss
parrott
to
herself
and
folding
up
the
little
note
into
many
creases
she
stood
lost
in
thought
well
i
suppose
i
must
yield
to
the
parson
wife
for
she
has
some
good
reason
but
the
child
shall
stay
next
time
rachel
whose
spirits
had
risen
since
it
was
quite
positive
that
the
note
was
not
lost
now
seized
miss
parrott
hand
and
hopped
and
skipped
by
her
side
across
the
green
grass
on
their
return
to
the
mansion
simmons
came
out
of
his
retirement
his
chamois
skin
with
which
he
had
been
ostensibly
polishing
up
a
carriage
still
in
his
hand
to
stand
in
the
doorway
to
watch
them
well
i
surprised
he
declared
quite
slowly
and
impressively
as
befitted
a
to
an
old
genteel
family
oh
let
go
in
there
cried
rachel
catching
sight
of
the
tall
hollyhocks
behind
a
wicket
gate
and
pulling
at
the
long
slender
fingers
miss
parrott
hesitated
well
just
one
peep
she
said
for
it
is
near
to
luncheon
time
and
she
pulled
out
the
watch
from
her
belt
but
to
rachel
a
peep
meant
all
the
world
so
she
dropped
the
fingers
and
raced
through
the
gateway
to
get
there
first
and
thus
make
it
last
as
long
as
possible
oh
oh
she
cried
her
little
dark
face
aflame
with
delight
it
the
most
beautiful
place
then
she
began
to
run
up
and
down
all
the
narrow
paths
marking
the
circles
and
hearts
and
diamonds
in
which
the
garden
was
laid
out
and
sniffing
the
fragrance
as
she
ran
miss
parrott
seated
herself
on
a
stone
seat
by
the
fountain
in
the
center
her
delight
was
quite
equal
to
rachel
and
the
thin
wrinkled
face
assumed
a
more
peaceful
expression
than
it
had
carried
for
many
a
day
so
that
when
hooper
came
to
summon
her
to
luncheon
he
was
fairly
taken
aback
at
its
unwonted
cheer
rachel
miss
parrott
voice
had
a
pleasant
ring
to
it
rachel
came
dancing
along
a
little
curving
path
the
red
coral
beads
flying
up
and
down
on
her
breast
her
cheeks
nearly
as
red
oh
it
perfectly
beautiful
here
she
cried
do
you
like
it
miss
parrott
thin
cheek
glowed
too
it
carried
her
back
to
the
day
when
she
as
a
child
had
been
skipping
in
that
old
garden
and
her
heart
gave
a
throb
at
the
thought
that
there
were
perhaps
in
store
for
her
many
delights
yet
through
rachel
enjoyment
of
the
flowers
and
shrubs
but
come
child
she
brought
herself
up
suddenly
to
say
with
a
little
laugh
hooper
has
summoned
us
to
luncheon
and
we
must
obey
do
you
have
to
obey
a
servant
asked
rachel
coming
out
of
her
dance
to
fall
into
step
by
her
side
and
looking
up
with
eyes
always
said
miss
parrott
most
positively
else
they
wo
obey
me
if
i
do
it
system
that
makes
everything
comfortable
rachel
as
rachel
knew
nothing
whatever
about
system
she
followed
silently
her
small
head
full
of
the
beautiful
garden
in
which
she
had
been
rioting
and
which
oh
joy
miss
parrott
promised
she
should
visit
again
when
the
luncheon
was
over
and
seated
at
the
polished
mahogany
table
she
was
so
lost
in
thought
that
miss
parrott
in
state
at
the
other
end
was
obliged
to
speak
to
her
twice
before
she
looked
up
finish
your
soup
child
said
miss
parrott
rachel
had
even
begun
it
and
she
now
seized
the
first
thing
upon
which
her
hand
rested
a
heavy
silver
fork
hooper
back
of
his
mistress
chair
darted
forward
to
put
the
right
implement
before
her
but
rachel
gave
him
a
withering
glance
that
stopped
him
you
do
need
to
come
got
it
and
she
held
up
her
spoon
triumphantly
and
ever
after
all
through
the
meal
she
seemed
to
view
his
necessary
advances
as
so
many
affronts
intended
to
show
up
her
lack
of
manners
and
she
exercised
all
her
wits
to
keep
him
at
bay
so
that
the
old
butler
was
glad
when
the
meal
was
over
but
long
before
that
time
arrived
rachel
had
leaned
back
in
her
tall
carved
chair
letting
her
knife
and
fork
rest
on
her
plate
while
she
feasted
her
eyes
over
the
table
what
it
held
and
then
around
the
whole
apartment
there
some
of
the
same
flowers
like
the
ones
in
the
garden
she
said
bringing
her
gaze
back
to
point
to
the
silver
vase
and
its
nodding
clusters
in
the
center
of
the
table
what
are
they
those
are
larkspur
said
miss
parrott
craning
her
neck
to
see
around
the
high
silver
service
from
which
she
poured
her
tea
and
what
the
other
this
side
rachel
bobbed
over
on
her
chair
till
hooper
involuntarily
closed
his
eyes
expecting
she
would
go
entirely
off
from
her
chair
and
he
did
want
to
see
it
it
would
be
so
disgraceful
at
a
parrott
table
that
miss
parrott
too
leaned
over
on
her
chair
oh
why
that
a
ragged
robin
rachel
robin
repeated
rachel
hopping
off
from
her
chair
oh
i
want
to
see
it
and
she
ran
around
the
and
leaned
over
to
get
a
better
view
is
a
bit
ragged
she
cried
very
much
disappointed
and
besides
he
is
there
oh
rachel
exclaimed
miss
parrott
in
dismay
you
must
not
do
so
we
never
leave
our
chairs
when
we
are
at
the
rachel
thus
admonished
scuttled
back
to
her
seat
while
hooper
groaned
and
pretended
not
to
see
anything
but
she
kept
her
black
eyes
fastened
on
the
ragged
robins
there
is
any
bird
there
she
said
what
child
you
said
there
was
a
robin
in
those
flowers
said
rachel
again
using
her
little
brown
fingers
to
designate
the
vase
and
its
contents
and
that
he
was
ragged
and
there
is
any
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
miss
parrott
then
she
laughed
the
flowers
are
called
ragged
robins
rachel
she
said
oh
said
rachel
then
she
laughed
too
a
merry
little
peal
that
just
bubbled
over
because
she
was
happy
now
eat
your
luncheon
said
miss
parrott
hooper
you
may
give
her
some
more
milk
i
do
want
any
more
milk
said
rachel
waving
him
off
with
quite
an
air
i
got
lots
and
lots
peering
into
her
cup
she
took
up
her
knife
and
fork
again
but
looking
over
them
found
so
many
things
to
call
for
more
attention
than
they
seemed
to
be
worthy
of
that
she
soon
laid
them
down
again
upon
her
plate
where
did
you
used
to
sit
when
you
was
a
little
girl
she
asked
suddenly
when
she
had
been
reflecting
a
bit
i
oh
i
sat
at
the
side
of
the
table
said
miss
parrott
starting
as
she
was
thus
hastily
summoned
down
into
her
past
then
ca
i
sit
there
now
cried
rachel
flying
out
of
her
chair
again
say
ca
i
do
let
me
she
ran
clear
around
the
table
and
hung
over
miss
parrott
chair
hooper
groaned
again
and
looked
steadfastly
out
of
the
opposite
window
my
child
exclaimed
miss
parrott
her
tone
was
very
grave
but
she
put
her
long
arm
around
rachel
and
drew
her
closely
to
her
remember
what
i
said
you
must
not
leave
your
chair
during
a
meal
i
forgot
rachel
flew
back
again
not
waiting
for
her
request
to
be
granted
and
sat
down
meekly
in
her
place
and
you
must
eat
something
continued
miss
parrott
glancing
at
the
little
girl
plate
and
with
dreadful
qualms
at
her
old
heart
for
having
been
severe
if
you
do
rachel
henderson
wo
let
you
come
here
again
the
solemn
butler
folded
and
unfolded
his
hands
while
his
face
expressed
the
belief
that
such
a
calamity
could
possibly
be
borne
and
if
you
did
come
rachel
miss
parrott
took
up
her
cup
of
tea
and
set
it
down
again
untouched
i
should
feel
very
sorry
i
should
indeed
she
added
with
a
little
catch
in
her
throat
so
should
i
said
rachel
abruptly
then
she
picked
up
her
knife
and
fork
and
began
to
eat
as
fast
as
she
could
oh
my
dear
cried
miss
parrott
quite
horrified
not
so
fast
pray
do
rachel
looking
down
the
in
distress
rachel
by
this
time
was
alive
to
the
disgrace
she
was
undergoing
and
she
turned
quite
pale
and
deserting
her
food
altogether
sat
stiff
and
straight
on
her
chair
too
miserable
to
care
for
anything
miss
parrott
bore
this
for
a
and
then
without
a
warning
she
slipped
off
from
her
chair
and
went
quickly
down
to
the
end
of
the
table
i
not
blaming
you
you
poor
little
thing
she
declared
bending
over
the
dark
hair
do
think
so
rachel
rachel
turned
with
a
swift
movement
and
hid
her
face
in
the
laces
falling
from
miss
parrott
breast
i
want
to
go
home
to
henderson
she
sobbed
we
do
care
for
any
more
luncheon
hooper
said
miss
parrott
hoarsely
taking
rachel
hand
we
will
go
into
the
other
room
and
she
led
her
off
sobbing
when
rachel
reached
hooper
however
standing
petrified
with
surprise
she
looked
up
at
him
defiantly
and
brushed
the
tears
from
her
cheek
and
after
they
had
passed
out
hooper
still
stood
in
a
daze
at
last
he
came
out
of
it
and
ejaculating
well
i
never
did
he
began
to
clear
the
table
once
outside
miss
parrott
turned
suddenly
we
go
back
to
the
garden
she
said
this
pleased
rachel
very
much
and
she
forgot
her
distress
and
mortification
and
actually
smiled
up
into
the
old
face
your
hand
shaking
she
announced
turning
her
gaze
to
the
long
slender
fingers
covering
her
own
little
brown
palm
is
it
said
miss
parrott
absently
yes
it
shakes
dreadfully
said
rachel
with
a
critical
air
look
pointing
down
at
it
oh
that
is
nothing
began
miss
parrott
then
she
stopped
suddenly
and
put
both
hands
on
the
thin
little
shoulders
oh
child
she
said
brokenly
i
did
so
hope
you
like
me
for
i
nothing
in
this
world
to
live
for
rachel
and
now
you
want
to
go
back
to
the
parsonage
oh
i
do
want
to
go
back
i
do
love
you
cried
rachel
in
great
alarm
and
she
raised
her
little
brown
hands
and
actually
smoothed
the
long
wrinkled
face
between
them
do
look
so
you
look
dreadful
she
pleaded
for
at
the
touch
of
those
childish
hands
over
her
face
miss
parrott
broke
utterly
down
all
her
aristocratic
traditions
falling
away
in
a
second
of
time
to
reveal
her
lonely
hopeless
life
and
she
sobbed
in
a
way
very
hard
for
any
onlooker
to
hear
to
rachel
powerless
to
stop
her
it
seemed
the
most
terrible
thing
in
all
this
world
and
she
burst
out
in
her
misery
i
stay
here
forever
if
you
stop
that
word
forever
did
what
nothing
else
could
have
achieved
it
brought
miss
parrott
to
herself
then
it
was
rachel
who
led
her
about
the
garden
and
chattered
about
the
flowers
unmindful
whether
or
no
she
was
answered
until
presently
miss
parrott
was
quite
recovered
and
even
smiling
in
a
way
at
last
she
pulled
out
her
ancient
watch
from
her
belt
now
rachel
she
said
you
must
go
back
to
the
parsonage
this
afternoon
for
henderson
expects
you
i
stay
if
you
want
me
to
said
rachel
moving
closer
to
miss
side
no
dear
not
because
it
would
be
right
the
parson
and
his
wife
only
loaned
you
to
me
for
but
what
interrupted
rachel
abruptly
and
wrinkling
her
forehead
why
they
only
let
me
have
you
just
for
today
said
miss
parrott
oh
and
so
you
must
go
back
but
i
shall
come
for
you
again
and
miss
parrott
turned
a
hungry
glance
down
upon
the
dark
little
face
at
her
side
i
come
said
rachel
with
a
sociable
nod
and
rachel
miss
parrott
drew
her
closer
to
her
side
you
may
keep
the
coral
beads
dear
that
shows
you
are
really
coming
back
to
me
to
stay
for
ever
and
always
cried
rachel
patting
the
necklace
lovingly
with
one
hand
can
i
keep
just
forever
say
can
i
yes
child
miss
parrott
old
face
smiled
in
delight
at
the
compact
they
are
yours
to
keep
all
your
life
and
now
she
added
brightly
i
want
you
to
come
into
the
and
what
demanded
rachel
who
felt
it
was
much
better
for
all
concerned
in
a
conversation
to
understand
things
as
they
went
along
why
that
is
the
parlor
answered
miss
parrott
oh
i
want
to
hear
you
sing
rachel
cried
miss
parrott
longingly
i
can
hardly
wait
come
she
hurried
the
child
along
with
hasty
steps
rachel
skipping
by
her
side
i
sing
she
said
all
you
want
me
to
i
know
lots
and
lots
of
things
until
the
grand
piano
in
the
long
dim
not
opened
for
many
years
was
reached
then
she
spun
down
the
middle
of
the
apartment
i
going
to
dance
first
she
announced
picking
out
the
skirt
of
her
gown
on
either
side
my
but
ai
it
dark
here
though
xxiv
rachel
future
when
the
old
brougham
drew
up
in
front
of
the
colonial
door
miss
parrott
let
her
hands
fall
away
from
the
it
ca
surely
be
time
for
you
to
go
rachel
then
she
did
a
thing
she
could
not
remember
doing
in
all
her
life
she
deliberately
went
on
with
her
employment
allowing
simmons
to
wait
on
his
carriage
box
while
she
broke
up
the
system
of
years
that
always
made
her
punctual
to
a
minute
you
may
sing
that
over
again
rachel
she
said
beginning
on
the
strains
of
the
opera
that
rachel
had
gathered
from
the
on
the
street
corners
then
may
i
dance
again
begged
rachel
please
just
once
before
i
go
yes
said
miss
parrott
sitting
very
straight
and
giving
all
the
graceful
little
quirks
to
the
slender
fingers
which
her
long
since
dead
and
buried
had
taught
her
now
begin
child
so
up
and
down
high
and
clear
rang
rachel
voice
with
no
more
effort
than
the
birds
outside
put
forth
the
sound
penetrating
the
ancient
walls
and
paralyzing
every
domestic
while
it
nearly
made
simmons
outside
fall
from
his
box
she
hai
touched
that
pianner
in
ten
years
said
the
cook
in
a
hushed
voice
oh
me
i
afraid
she
going
to
die
and
she
flung
her
apron
over
her
head
die
exclaimed
hooper
finding
his
voice
she
wo
die
with
that
young
one
here
he
added
in
scorn
now
may
i
dance
pleaded
rachel
plucking
miss
parrott
sleeve
do
let
me
you
said
i
might
yes
said
miss
parrott
wrenching
herself
away
from
the
operatic
strains
to
begin
on
a
little
jig
oh
that
so
funny
giggled
rachel
hopping
aimlessly
in
the
center
of
the
big
and
trying
to
keep
time
do
stop
you
put
me
all
out
but
that
is
a
said
miss
parrott
jingling
away
and
sister
and
i
used
to
dance
quite
prettily
to
it
i
remember
well
i
ca
said
rachel
hopping
wildly
and
doing
her
best
to
get
into
step
oh
dear
she
brought
up
suddenly
flushed
and
panting
what
is
the
matter
rachel
miss
parrott
let
her
hands
rest
on
the
yellow
ivory
keys
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
her
oh
i
ca
dance
said
rachel
when
you
play
so
funnily
it
does
go
like
that
it
goes
so
she
picked
up
her
gown
again
and
made
a
sweep
off
in
one
direction
and
then
in
another
her
feet
scarcely
touching
the
pictured
roses
and
lilies
with
which
the
velvet
carpet
was
strewn
all
the
while
singing
a
tune
that
seemed
to
carry
her
off
on
its
own
melody
miss
parrott
turned
around
on
the
and
watched
her
breathlessly
it
was
therefore
much
later
than
the
parsonage
people
expected
when
the
old
brougham
set
rachel
down
at
their
gate
and
she
walked
into
the
house
supported
on
either
side
by
peletiah
and
ezekiel
who
had
been
watching
there
a
full
hour
for
her
arrival
i
like
her
she
said
marching
up
to
the
minister
wife
she
gave
me
these
putting
her
hand
on
the
red
coral
beads
on
her
neck
and
going
back
again
i
guess
but
it
was
to
stay
that
rachel
went
back
on
the
morrow
it
was
only
for
a
day
despite
all
the
pleadings
made
by
miss
parrott
and
all
the
desire
of
the
parson
and
his
wife
to
please
their
honored
parishioner
and
most
of
all
the
earnest
wish
to
consent
to
what
would
probably
be
for
the
best
good
they
held
firmly
to
the
first
statement
that
nothing
could
be
arranged
till
fisher
and
king
had
been
consulted
they
have
sent
the
child
here
to
us
and
here
she
must
stay
until
they
make
some
other
arrangement
they
said
firmly
and
no
amount
of
urging
could
make
them
say
anything
else
so
letters
had
to
fly
back
and
forth
from
the
parsonage
and
the
king
estate
in
the
big
city
and
miss
parrott
wrote
long
letters
in
a
pinched
hand
in
very
faint
ink
crossing
the
paper
whenever
she
was
afraid
she
had
said
enough
to
plead
her
cause
successfully
which
condition
of
mind
she
was
in
perpetually
all
through
these
writing
days
these
letters
old
king
endeavored
to
read
at
the
first
but
he
soon
threw
them
down
impatiently
the
child
shall
never
go
to
a
woman
who
has
no
more
sense
he
loudly
declared
then
polly
or
jasper
would
hurry
in
and
wade
through
the
missives
and
when
he
saw
the
hungry
longing
of
the
desolate
soul
and
the
sweet
refinement
of
the
writer
came
out
and
the
sterling
honesty
was
revealed
in
the
prim
sentences
he
relented
and
went
tumultuously
over
to
the
other
side
yes
yes
she
shall
go
he
declared
pulling
out
his
big
handkerchief
to
blow
his
nose
violently
to
remove
all
suspicion
that
anything
was
the
matter
with
his
eyes
be
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
her
of
course
she
must
go
and
so
it
was
finally
settled
that
rachel
was
to
live
at
miss
parrott
and
be
her
own
little
girl
going
down
to
the
parsonage
every
day
to
learn
her
lessons
under
henderson
care
until
the
time
when
she
would
be
ready
to
be
sent
to
such
a
school
as
miss
parrott
might
select
should
arrive
and
she
must
come
and
see
me
sometimes
said
phronsie
when
the
announcement
was
made
in
the
king
household
my
little
girl
may
come
ca
she
grandpapa
she
begged
yes
yes
child
said
old
king
warmly
we
all
shall
want
to
see
rachel
now
and
then
the
comfort
committee
being
and
in
fine
running
order
by
this
time
sterling
gathering
them
around
her
sofa
in
her
spacious
upstairs
polly
and
alexia
saw
no
reason
why
they
begin
work
on
the
cooking
club
because
said
polly
if
we
are
really
going
to
learn
how
to
cook
things
why
we
ought
to
begin
and
the
mothers
of
the
several
boys
and
girls
who
were
to
form
it
taking
instantly
to
the
idea
the
two
girls
and
jasper
set
to
work
to
write
the
notices
of
the
first
meeting
we
ought
to
have
another
boy
said
jasper
on
the
committee
alexia
wrinkled
up
her
face
oh
do
boys
are
so
tiresome
she
said
why
i
am
a
boy
said
jasper
bursting
into
a
laugh
oh
well
you
are
different
said
alexia
we
always
expect
you
around
thank
you
said
jasper
with
a
low
bow
i
sure
i
ought
to
feel
very
much
complimented
alexia
and
he
laughed
again
well
i
sure
boys
are
such
nuisances
said
alexia
leaning
her
long
arms
on
the
table
they
were
in
the
library
at
king
and
besides
they
wo
want
to
come
to
our
cooking
club
i
verily
believe
so
the
use
of
having
them
on
the
committee
oh
yes
they
will
declared
jasper
eagerly
you
do
know
anything
about
it
if
you
say
that
why
clare
and
pickering
and
ever
so
many
more
are
just
wild
to
be
asked
oh
well
then
if
we
got
to
have
some
boy
on
the
committee
said
alexia
accepting
the
situation
let
ask
pickering
dodge
i
rather
have
pick
said
jasper
in
a
tone
of
great
satisfaction
and
polly
saying
the
same
thing
it
was
decided
then
and
there
well
now
that
matter
is
off
our
hands
said
alexia
let
get
to
writing
these
old
notices
and
her
hands
began
to
bustle
about
among
the
little
pile
of
paper
and
envelopes
hold
on
said
jasper
if
pick
is
to
be
on
this
committee
he
must
help
us
with
these
things
and
he
want
to
for
it
will
be
great
fun
o
bother
exclaimed
alexia
jerking
back
her
chair
now
we
got
to
wait
you
see
for
yourself
what
a
nuisance
it
is
to
try
to
get
you
boys
in
jasper
oh
i
get
pick
over
here
in
a
jiffy
declared
jasper
plunging
out
of
the
library
you
wo
have
to
wait
long
for
us
alexia
it
was
more
than
ten
minutes
by
the
clock
when
in
rushed
the
two
boys
and
swarmed
around
the
big
table
well
i
declare
cried
alexia
looking
up
admiringly
from
a
receipt
book
which
fisher
had
loaned
them
and
over
which
the
heads
of
the
two
girls
were
bent
if
you
boys
have
been
quick
though
have
we
cried
jasper
and
his
eyes
twinkled
do
tell
whispered
pickering
over
his
shoulder
and
what
are
you
two
whispering
about
cried
alexia
deserting
the
now
tell
us
she
demanded
dreadfully
afraid
she
would
miss
some
news
well
you
see
began
jasper
hush
hush
said
pickering
now
do
pay
any
attention
to
pickering
said
alexia
turning
a
cold
shoulder
to
the
individual
do
tell
us
jasper
what
is
it
the
fact
is
said
jasper
laughing
i
did
have
to
go
for
pickering
at
all
that
is
only
to
the
corner
he
was
coming
here
and
jasper
nearly
knocked
the
breath
out
of
me
finished
pickering
he
bolted
into
me
so
well
you
were
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
pavement
retorted
jasper
is
that
all
cried
alexia
horribly
disappointed
to
get
no
news
oh
dear
me
well
do
sit
down
now
you
have
come
and
let
us
get
to
these
horrible
old
notices
so
the
boys
drew
up
their
chairs
and
polly
pushed
the
with
an
affectionate
little
pat
into
the
center
of
the
table
that
what
we
are
going
to
study
she
said
gleefully
study
echoed
pickering
with
a
very
long
face
i
did
come
over
here
to
study
i
get
enough
of
that
at
school
and
he
glared
in
a
very
injured
way
at
jasper
do
get
upset
said
jasper
patting
him
on
the
back
you
like
this
pick
i
tell
you
and
it
a
said
polly
laughing
merrily
all
right
said
pickering
immensely
relieved
and
reaching
out
his
long
arm
he
seized
it
and
whirled
the
leaves
pie
that
sounds
good
to
cook
cabbage
oh
dear
me
see
here
now
jasper
seized
the
book
and
shut
it
up
with
a
bang
no
one
is
going
to
look
into
that
until
we
write
these
notices
why
we
even
got
a
cooking
club
yet
give
it
back
roared
pickering
after
him
as
jasper
hopped
out
of
his
chair
carrying
the
book
no
sir
cried
jasper
bearing
off
the
book
out
of
the
room
there
you
never
find
that
he
observed
coming
back
to
slip
into
his
seat
with
satisfaction
well
now
said
alexia
sweetly
if
you
two
boys
are
through
scrapping
we
begin
on
these
notices
she
picked
an
envelope
off
from
the
pile
oh
dear
me
who
is
the
first
one
to
ask
i
think
larry
ought
to
have
it
said
polly
oh
polly
pepper
exclaimed
alexia
larry
ca
come
for
ever
so
long
with
his
collar
bone
all
smashed
and
his
leg
hurt
the
very
idea
polly
gave
a
little
shiver
well
he
would
like
to
be
asked
she
said
and
i
think
so
too
declared
jasper
a
chap
would
enjoy
it
twice
as
much
to
get
an
invitation
when
he
was
abed
and
could
come
well
that
nice
to
say
cried
alexia
bursting
into
a
loud
laugh
in
which
pickering
joined
you
done
it
now
he
said
clapping
jasper
on
the
back
i
glad
of
it
old
chap
after
the
way
you
acted
about
that
old
so
i
have
said
jasper
grimly
then
he
laughed
as
hard
as
the
others
well
you
know
what
i
mean
and
we
ought
to
give
larry
the
first
attention
i
going
to
write
the
notice
to
him
declared
alexia
dipping
her
pen
in
the
and
beginning
with
a
flourish
but
she
threw
it
down
before
she
had
finished
his
first
name
polly
you
ought
to
write
the
first
notice
she
cried
you
proposed
the
club
that
no
matter
said
polly
so
long
as
we
are
going
to
have
the
club
go
ahead
alexia
no
i
not
going
to
said
alexia
obstinately
and
leaning
back
in
her
chair
you
just
got
to
do
it
polly
so
there
there
be
no
peace
polly
for
any
of
us
until
you
do
said
pickering
thrusting
his
hands
lazily
into
his
pockets
and
i
think
people
would
do
better
to
go
to
work
and
help
said
alexia
decidedly
than
to
set
other
people
against
oh
dear
me
as
she
found
herself
hopelessly
entangled
you
would
do
better
to
get
yourself
out
of
that
sentence
alexia
laughed
jasper
before
you
do
anything
else
well
i
do
care
said
alexia
joining
in
the
general
laugh
it
too
mean
for
anything
pickering
to
say
i
fight
when
everybody
knows
i
suffer
just
everything
before
i
say
a
word
oh
dear
me
cried
pickering
faintly
and
when
you
two
stop
sparring
said
jasper
perhaps
we
can
do
some
work
come
now
polly
and
i
do
propose
to
do
the
whole
alexia
at
this
scrabbled
up
another
envelope
and
began
to
write
as
fast
as
she
could
and
pickering
selecting
a
pen
and
getting
down
to
business
the
room
began
to
assume
a
very
aspect
now
that
done
said
alexia
tossing
aside
the
envelope
i
addressed
notice
number
two
whose
is
it
asked
pickering
glancing
up
from
his
own
to
the
scrawling
characters
where
the
envelope
lay
face
uppermost
on
the
table
who
is
number
two
alexia
you
must
see
cried
alexia
twitching
it
away
you
go
on
and
address
your
own
pickering
and
let
mine
alone
well
i
seen
already
said
pickering
coolly
it
would
be
impossible
not
to
read
your
writing
a
mile
off
alexia
well
that
much
better
than
to
write
such
mean
lazy
little
words
that
nobody
can
make
them
out
she
retorted
oh
clear
we
have
a
pattern
of
the
notice
made
yet
said
polly
leaning
back
in
her
chair
after
the
labor
of
getting
the
first
envelope
addressed
and
she
pushed
up
the
little
brown
rings
of
hair
from
her
brow
for
polly
did
like
very
well
to
write
and
it
always
took
her
some
time
to
achieve
anything
in
that
line
jasper
you
draw
up
one
do
she
begged
oh
dear
me
cried
jasper
aghast
i
ca
polly
you
can
do
it
much
better
misery
me
exclaimed
polly
i
could
do
it
in
all
this
world
and
she
looked
so
distressed
that
jasper
hastened
to
say
come
along
then
pick
and
help
me
out
and
i
try
but
picketing
protesting
that
he
did
know
any
more
how
to
write
such
a
notice
than
prince
lying
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
jasper
in
despair
drew
up
a
sheet
of
paper
and
wrote
in
big
staring
letters
and
with
a
great
flourish
clear
across
the
top
of
the
page
attention
goodness
me
cried
pickering
his
pale
eyes
following
jasper
pen
it
looks
like
a
summons
or
just
like
miss
salisbury
when
she
going
to
say
something
quite
ugly
and
horrid
said
alexia
with
a
grimace
oh
alexia
said
polly
well
it
does
said
alexia
you
know
for
yourself
polly
she
always
stands
up
quite
stiff
on
the
platform
and
says
young
ladies
oh
i
quite
hate
the
word
because
we
all
have
to
look
at
her
well
it
does
good
service
then
said
jasper
coolly
since
it
makes
you
do
the
very
thing
wanted
and
we
would
mind
looking
at
her
said
alexia
running
on
with
her
reminiscences
if
she
did
make
us
do
every
single
thing
she
says
that
too
bad
said
jasper
with
a
laugh
and
flourishing
away
on
the
second
line
of
the
notice
you
need
laugh
said
alexia
grimly
i
guess
you
would
if
you
had
our
miss
salisbury
at
your
school
jasper
king
is
she
any
worse
than
our
mr
fraser
said
jasper
i
wonder
i
tell
you
what
alexia
he
keeps
us
boys
at
it
does
he
pick
well
i
rather
guess
said
picketing
concisely
but
his
look
told
volumes
oh
you
boys
have
an
easy
enough
time
said
alexia
with
a
sniff
and
you
are
always
grumbling
about
how
hard
it
is
while
i
do
say
a
word
but
just
bear
things
i
so
sorry
for
poor
miss
salisbury
observed
pickering
lazily
watching
jasper
efforts
well
you
need
be
retorted
alexia
she
very
fond
of
me
miss
salisbury
is
and
i
do
in
the
least
know
what
she
do
if
i
left
her
school
but
i
never
shall
go
away
for
i
just
dote
on
her
it
looks
like
it
said
pickering
with
a
laugh
well
i
do
declared
alexia
she
my
very
sweetest
friend
except
polly
pepper
so
there
oh
dear
me
i
do
know
what
next
to
say
cried
jasper
holding
off
the
notice
at
arm
length
and
scowling
at
it
dreadfully
you
ought
to
see
your
face
jasper
cried
alexia
dear
me
positively
awful
well
it
not
half
as
bad
as

said
jasper
with
this
terrible
old
notice
weighing
me
down

pickering

jasper
turning
over
the
notice

pickering
coolly
well
we

out
said
jasper
neck
and
heels
if
you
take
care
well
but
really
this
is
awful
work
he
whirled
over
the
notice
again
and
glared
at
it
savagely
why
do
we
just
say
cooking
club
is
to
be
formed
proposed
polly
and
oh
that
will
be

interrupted
alexia
clapping
her
hands
oh
polly

oh
i
could
said
polly
drawing
back
yes
polly
do
begged
jasper
oh

polly
well
then
you
tell
me
what
to

said
jasper
laughing
she
did
said
alexia
impatiently
a
cooking
club
is
to
be
formed

you
hear
her
i
have
that
said
jasper
scribbling
away
on
a
fresh
piece
of
paper
now
what

on
polly
said
alexia
well
oh

jasper
vastly
pleased
that
he
was
to
be
helped
out
and
finishing
it
all
up
with
great
energy
well
what
else
and
he
poised
his
pen
in
air
and
looked
at
polly
why
is
that
enough
said
polly
a
little
pucker
beginning
to
come
on
her
forehead
i
should
think
so
said
pickering
it
tells
all
the
story
and
they
will
come

be

said
jasper
holding
off
the
notice
again
this
time
for
everybody
inspection
and
that
the
main
thing
and
now
we
can
all
begin
to
write
them
said
alexia
in
great
satisfaction
seizing
her
pen
which
she
had
dropped
do
put
it
in
the
middle
of
the
table
jasper
where
we
can
all
see
wait
till
i
write
a
good
one
said
jasper
beginning
on
a
fresh
sheet
of
paper
i
was
hurrying
so
to
get
it
all
down
you
can
hardly
read
it
so
he
wrote
it
out
in
his
best
hand
then
propped
the
notice
up
against
the
now
begin
he
said
let
race
cried
alexia
already
scrawling
the
first
words
at
a
great
rate
oh

decently
then
said
polly
in
alarm

jasper
well
i
not
going
to
race
anyway
declared
pickering
making
slow
lazy
strokes
with
his
pen
it
quite
bad
enough
to
have
to
write
these
odious
things
without
breaking
one
neck
over
them
well
do
let
talk
said
alexia
seeing
that
she
could
have
any
part
in
the
conversation
since
all
her
mind
had
to
go
into
her
task
oh
dear
me
i
left
out
the
dot
to
my
and
misery
there
a
blot
it
was
all
because
i
was
listening
to
you
pickering
dodge
well
we
all
be
as
still
as
mice
now
said
polly
so
no
sound
was
heard
save
the
scratching
of
pens
over
the
paper
as
the
work
went
gayly
on
oh
is
it
too
bad
that
we
ca
any
of
us
find
that
bill
joel
lost
at
the
garden
party
broke
out
alexia
when
this
sort
of
thing
had
proceeded
for
some
time
ugh
cried
polly
and
her
pen
slipped
making
an
awful
scratch
and
just
spoiling
the
best
notice
she
had
written
jasper
raised
his
head
and
cast
a
warning
glance
over
the
table
at
alexia
but
it
was
too
late
i
do
believe
we
shall
find
it
some
time
said
polly
scraping
away
with
the
and
only
making
matters
worse
take
care
polly
the
ink
is
too
fresh
warned
jasper
wait
until
it
dries
well
i
smeared
it
all
up
now
said
polly
leaning
back
in
her
chair
and
viewing
her
work
with
despair
perhaps
it
can
be
fixed
said
alexia
overwhelmed
with
distress
and
leaning
forward
to
see
the
worst
i
know
it
can
let
me
try
polly
no
no
alexia
i
would
said
jasper
it
quite
bad
enough
already
well
maybe
i
can
do
it
persisted
alexia
if
i
could
only
try
you
may
try
said
polly
pushing
the
paper
toward
her
when
she
saw
alexia
face
but
it
no
matter
anyway
i
write
another
and
she
had
already
begun
it
when
alexia
threw
down
the
it
no
sort
of
use
she
said
and
i
made
a
shocking
hole
in
the
paper
oh
dear
me
and
she
looked
so
utterly
miserable
that
polly
brow
cleared
and
she
began
to
laugh
dear
me
she
said
it
is
a
bit
of
matter
and
see
i
ever
so
much
done
already
on
this
and
i
do
believe
we
shall
find
that
note
sometime
i
do
verily
believe
so
alexia
so
do
i
cried
jasper
heartily
pickering
said
nothing
he
did
really
believe
the
bill
would
ever
be
found
having
helped
jasper
to
ransack
so
many
possible
and
impossible
places
but
he
was
going
to
say
so
and
thus
add
to
the
general
gloom
and
i
think
it
was
awfully
nice
of
joel
to
do
that
dreadful
work
over
king
old
books
and
earn
the
money
said
alexia
polly
looked
up
with
a
smile
was
it
she
cried
radiantly
and
father
says
joe
does
the
lists
so
well
said
jasper
heartily
he
sticks
at
it
every
day
like
a
leech
and
there
ca
anything
get
him
off
to
play
till
the
hour
is
over
well
i
do
see
how
he
can
said
alexia
drawing
a
long
breath
dear
me
it
would
just
tire
me
to
death
why
polly
pepper
alexia
threw
clown
her
pen
and
stared
at
her
when
is
the
first
meeting
to
be
why
you
know
said
polly
writing
away
laboriously
next
wednesday
evening
of
course
well
we
do
say
so
said
alexia
how
in
the
world
are
they
to
know
the
other
members
of
the
committee
stopped
work
immediately
and
glanced
ruefully
at
the
little
pile
of
notices
accumulating
in
the
middle
of
the
table
we
can
never
write
those
all
over
began
polly
tragically
pickering
put
out
a
long
hand
and
picked
out
from
the
pile
the
one
he
had
written
i
shall
just
write
evening
july
down
in
one
corner
he
said
oh
goody
exclaimed
alexia
her
face
brightening
i
shall
do
mine
so
pulling
out
her
scrawls
from
the
heap
of
notices
but
we
do
tell
where
the
meeting
is
to
be
said
jasper
after
they
had
all
fallen
to
work
again
at
this
second
fright
no
one
seemed
to
be
able
to
speak
it
was
alexia
who
first
found
her
voice
why
not
put
it
in
the
other
corner
she
said
and
that
just
balances
said
jasper
holding
one
of
his
notices
up
when
the
two
additions
had
been
made
so
it
really
looks
better
than
ever
but
we
must
make
any
more
blunders
observed
pickering
wisely
for
we
have
any
extra
corners
to
go
to
now
oh
we
are
going
to
make
any
declared
alexia
and
we
will
soon
be
through
thank
goodness
as
the
pens
set
up
lively
work
once
more
i
hope
so
polly
gave
a
long
sigh
oh
dear
me
it
would
be
so
hard
to
do
cooking
for
the
club
as
to
write
a
single
one
of
these
things
xxv
jack
parish
grandpapa
joel
came
in
with
a
shout
rushed
around
the
room
two
or
three
times
and
finally
came
up
to
the
big
quite
blown
dear
me
exclaimed
old
king
laying
down
his
pen
have
you
really
got
through
joe
grandpapa
said
joel
his
black
eyes
shining
and
bobbing
over
his
head
to
get
a
good
look
into
the
old
gentleman
face
she
asked
him
she
really
has
who
asked
king
very
much
puzzled
sterling
said
joel
in
a
tone
of
the
greatest
satisfaction
then
he
began
to
dance
again
snapping
his
brown
fingers
to
keep
time
when
you
come
out
of
that
war
dance
joel
said
old
king
leaning
back
in
his
big
chair
to
laugh
at
him
perhaps
you
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
whom
you
are
talking
about
all
this
time
joel
stopped
his
mad
career
and
ran
up
to
the
old
gentleman
side
why
jack
parish
i
thought
you
knew
grandpapa
he
added
reproachfully
i
suppose
i
might
have
known
if
i
stopped
to
consider
that
you
talked
your
parish
boy
every
day
since
the
little
affair
on
the
pond
said
king
still
laughing
well
and
so
sterling
has
invited
your
friend
joel
to
some
festivity
i
suppose
eh
yes
said
joel
she
has
his
satisfaction
returning
it
a
supper
at
her
house
night
grandpapa
he
leaned
over
to
bring
his
brown
cheek
close
to
the
one
under
the
white
hair
just
think
of
that
whew
ejaculated
the
old
gentleman
and
she
has
had
company
for
ten
years
well
she
going
to
have
us
every
single
one
in
the
comfort
committee
declared
joel
decidedly
and
she
asked
jack
most
particularly
she
did
grandpapa
she
really
did
may
i
go
down
and
tell
him
now
may
i
grandpapa
he
cried
eagerly
why
if
your
mother
says
so
i
suppose
began
king
she
says
i
may
go
if
you
think
best
cried
joel
hanging
to
the
arms
of
the
big
chair
and
having
hard
work
to
curb
his
impatience
oh
grandpapa
please
hurry
and
say
yes
instead
of
complying
with
this
demand
the
old
gentleman
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
steadily
gazed
into
space
while
he
revolved
something
in
his
mind
at
last
when
joel
thought
he
could
brook
the
delay
another
minute
king
whirled
suddenly
around
in
his
chair
i
tell
you
what
it
is
joel
you
and
i
will
go
down
to
see
your
friend
ourselves
oh
grandpapa
joel
gave
a
leap
and
seized
king
arm
with
both
hands
right
away
now
he
cried
with
sparkling
eyes
right
away
now
declared
old
king
getting
out
of
his
chair
that
is
as
soon
as
we
can
make
ourselves
presentable
for
our
walk
goodness
me
joe
what
a
whirlwind
you
are
bursting
into
another
laugh
joel
did
care
what
he
was
called
so
long
as
he
was
really
going
to
see
jack
parish
and
carry
him
the
wonderful
invitation
and
all
the
way
down
to
the
little
grocer
on
common
street
he
just
bubbled
over
with
happiness
till
everybody
who
passed
the
two
felt
a
glow
at
the
heart
at
the
merry
comrades
and
many
were
the
backward
glances
cast
at
the
old
gentleman
of
stately
mien
with
a
boy
of
the
jolliest
appearance
hanging
to
his
hand
well
well
well
and
so
here
we
are
old
king
looked
up
curiously
at
the
little
sign
above
the
door
ichabod
parish
grocer
then
down
over
the
shop
windows
overrunning
with
canned
goods
and
to
finish
up
an
outside
stall
on
which
jostled
and
overcrowded
each
other
every
description
of
vegetable
in
the
market
from
a
cabbage
down
a
fat
man
with
a
big
apron
that
had
been
white
earlier
in
the
day
came
out
of
the
shop
and
stood
by
the
stall
anything
in
our
line
sir
he
said
he
had
a
little
pad
of
paper
in
one
hand
and
a
pencil
in
the
other
well
yes
said
old
king
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
for
by
this
time
he
perceived
some
lines
along
the
fat
cheeks
that
showed
very
plainly
the
habit
of
smiles
running
up
and
down
in
them
i
come
for
a
boy
if
you
please
a
boy
said
the
fat
man
laughing
till
the
round
cheeks
were
all
wrinkled
up
well
now
i
take
it
you
joking
sir
oh
no
i
not
said
old
king
very
seriously
but
the
other
man
had
been
just
as
observing
in
his
way
and
had
seen
the
twinkle
in
the
keen
eyes
so
now
he
laughed
some
more
and
waited
patiently
for
the
joke
to
be
explained
i
take
it
you
have
a
boy
named
jack
hereabout
said
king
presently
all
the
wrinkles
dropped
suddenly
out
of
the
fat
red
cheeks
he
done
nothin
wrong
jack
hai
gasped
the
man
oh
grandpapa
tell
him
what
we
come
for
cried
joel
twitching
king
hand
and
quite
aghast
to
see
the
suffering
in
jack
father
do
please
grandpapa
old
king
was
rapidly
exclaiming
no
no
bless
you
did
you
think
come
at
you
in
such
a
way
why
this
boy
here
thrusting
joel
forward
has
got
an
invitation
for
him
now
then
joel
my
boy
speak
up
and
joel
did
speak
up
and
in
a
minute
they
were
all
there
in
the
little
shop
and
the
fat
grocer
was
bustling
around
to
work
a
chair
out
from
behind
the
counter
but
as
the
big
store
cat
and
several
parcels
were
on
it
it
took
a
bit
of
time
meanwhile
old
king
sat
down
upon
a
box
of
soap
while
joel
hung
over
his
shoulder
a
woman
came
in
with
a
jug
to
be
filled
with
molasses
and
a
small
girl
for
a
box
of
matches
but
the
little
grocer
told
them
to
wait
and
after
he
had
placed
the
chair
and
gotten
king
off
from
the
and
into
it
he
bustled
to
a
door
at
the
head
of
the
shop
ma
he
cried
putting
his
head
into
the
room
to
which
it
opened
do
you
know
where
jack
is
he
upstairs
said
a
voice
evidently
ma
well
tell
him
to
come
down
said
the
fat
grocer
all
right
ichabod
jack
to
home
announced
the
grocer
coming
back
with
the
air
of
imparting
a
piece
of
news
just
as
much
as
if
every
word
had
not
been
heard
well
now
mis
jones
i
fill
your
jug
he
took
it
from
her
and
she
settled
herself
comfortably
during
the
slow
process
to
watch
the
stately
figure
in
the
chair
to
her
heart
content
her
example
being
followed
by
the
small
girl
who
had
of
course
been
obliged
to
wait
for
the
box
of
matches
a
pair
of
feet
could
be
heard
coming
through
the
room
just
mentioned
i
do
know
what
your
pa
wants
you
for
said
a
woman
voice
most
likely
for
an
errand
so
jack
free
from
his
sling
for
doctor
fisher
had
found
him
surprisingly
quick
at
recovery
bolted
through
the
doorway
and
into
the
shop
and
without
a
bit
of
warning
brought
up
against
old
horatio
king
and
joel
great
scott
he
cried
scared
out
of
his
usual
shyness
yes
said
joel
sociably
bobbing
his
face
into
jack
i
come
to
ask
you
to
supper
sterling
told
me
to
most
particularly
you
know
dear
me
joe
exclaimed
old
king
do
give
it
to
him
more
slowly
for
jack
head
of
light
hair
was
wagging
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
visitors
in
great
distress
i
am
said
joel
awful
slow
grandpapa
it
does
look
much
like
it
said
the
old
gentleman
bursting
into
a
laugh
the
fat
grocer
over
at
the
molasses
barrel
looked
across
anxiously
at
the
group
and
for
once
in
his
life
wished
jones
although
one
of
his
best
customers
anywhere
but
in
his
shop
illustration
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
little
shop
well
try
again
joel
said
king
so
joel
began
once
more
and
before
long
jack
parish
understood
fairly
that
sterling
had
actually
invited
him
to
supper
on
the
following
night
with
the
comfort
committee
just
as
if
he
were
not
the
son
of
ichabod
parish
the
little
grocer
on
common
street
but
were
one
of
the
rich
boys
of
joel
pepper
set
pa
he
shouted
he
wanted
some
one
of
his
own
family
to
help
understand
this
puzzle
do
come
here
the
fat
grocer
hearing
this
cry
could
stand
it
no
longer
trying
to
stamp
out
his
curiosity
so
deserting
the
molasses
barrel
and
forgetting
to
turn
the
spigot
he
bore
off
the
jug
there
mis
jones
there
you
are
depositing
it
with
a
thump
on
the
counter
and
waddled
over
to
his
son
and
the
visitors
when
he
comprehended
the
matter
as
after
an
infinite
deal
of
pains
he
did
his
astonishment
knew
no
bounds
it
absolutely
struck
him
speechless
and
there
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
little
shop
lost
to
the
fact
that
he
was
a
small
grocer
on
an
obscure
street
he
was
the
father
of
jack
hitherto
obliged
to
go
with
boys
of
the
neighborhood
not
of
specially
nice
families
with
manners
and
aims
to
match
now
oh
joy
with
a
chance
for
something
better
that
might
reach
to
unknown
heights
he
might
even
become
an
alderman
the
little
grocer
breast
heaved
with
delight
but
even
in
that
blissful
moment
his
first
thought
was
of
his
wife
wo
your
mother
be
proud
jack
he
made
out
to
utter
your
molasses
is
all
runnin
out
proclaimed
the
small
girl
who
was
waiting
for
the
box
of
matches
and
jack
springing
to
help
his
father
who
bounded
to
the
molasses
barrel
old
king
and
joel
took
themselves
off
without
any
further
embarrassment
to
the
little
grocer
who
surely
never
could
in
all
this
world
express
his
gratitude
as
he
wanted
to
be
at
my
house
afternoon
and
we
go
over
together
said
joel
with
longing
glances
at
the
center
of
bustle
around
the
molasses
barrel
oh
grandpapa
how
i
do
wish
i
could
have
staid
and
helped
clean
up
joel
burst
out
as
they
left
the
shop
oh
my
goodness
joel
exclaimed
old
king
such
a
messy
job
how
can
you
it
would
have
been
such
fun
mourned
joel
wishing
he
could
have
free
access
to
just
such
a
small
grocer
shop
and
thinking
that
jack
was
the
luckiest
fellow
alive
when
i
grow
up
i
going
to
have
a
shop
like
that
he
declared
after
marching
on
in
silence
down
the
next
block
and
surveying
with
favor
all
the
surroundings
of
the
narrow
street
i
thought
you
were
going
to
sell
tin
like
your
biggs
of
badgertown
said
king
mischievously
joel
hung
his
head
i
was
but
i
think
a
shop
would
be
nicer
after
all
you
can
have
everything
in
it
you
know
grandpapa
even
molasses
put
in
king
well
i
would
decide
the
matter
just
now
joel
my
boy
which
you
will
be
when
you
are
grown
up
there
plenty
of
time
yet
ahead
of
you
jack
parish
with
his
hair
carefully
oiled
by
his
anxious
mother
and
his
very
best
clothes
on
a
circumstance
calculated
to
invest
him
with
dread
and
rob
him
of
every
bit
of
comfort
to
begin
with
presented
himself
at
king
mansion
on
the
next
afternoon
his
countenance
was
long
and
he
looked
so
worried
that
joel
rushing
out
to
meet
him
involuntarily
ejaculated
oh
dear
me
in
dismay
after
regarding
each
other
uncomfortably
for
a
minute
in
which
jack
began
to
wish
himself
a
thousand
times
back
in
the
little
shop
joel
burst
out
seizing
his
arm
come
up
into
my
room
dave
and
mine
and
over
the
stairs
they
went
is
this
your
room
gasped
jack
forgetting
his
discomfort
and
staring
all
about
yes
it
is
said
joel
dave
and
mine
see
my
tennis
racket
jack
is
it
prime
darting
over
to
pull
it
out
of
a
corner
i
should
say
it
was
declared
jack
fingering
it
lovingly
as
joel
thrust
it
into
his
hand
with
a
do
you
play
a
little
said
jack
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
add
that
he
was
the
champion
player
of
the
common
street
team
on
the
dingy
little
open
space
given
up
to
goats
and
children
that
good
exclaimed
joel
with
shining
eyes
and
clapping
him
on
the
back
we
have
a
bout
together
sometime
and
here
are
my
he
seized
them
and
struck
an
attitude
come
on
jack
he
cried
in
huge
delight
so
jack
did
come
on
and
when
he
emerged
why
there
were
the
fencing
foils
to
try
and
when
this
was
all
over
and
both
boys
sat
down
flushed
and
panting
why
jack
best
clothes
and
his
oiled
hair
did
look
so
badly
to
joel
way
of
thinking
david
now
ran
in
it
time
to
get
ready
to
go
to
sterling
supper
he
said
with
a
nod
to
jack
so
it
is
cried
joel
beginning
to
run
here
and
there
for
his
other
shoes
and
clothes
jack
turned
away
with
a
feeling
that
it
was
good
manners
to
be
looking
on
and
glanced
out
of
the
window
come
over
and
look
at
our
butterflies
cried
joel
running
over
to
a
cabinet
against
the
wall
they
just
beauties
oh
have
you
collected
butterflies
cried
jack
whirling
around
greatly
excited
yes
dave
and
i
have
said
joel
we
have
lots
and
lots
it
did
take
jack
long
to
be
over
in
front
of
the
cabinet
and
pulling
out
its
many
drawers
so
that
he
was
lost
to
all
the
fuss
of
dressing
that
joel
and
david
were
undergoing
and
it
was
till
he
had
been
clapped
on
the
back
most
vigorously
with
a
wake
up
old
chap
that
he
realized
that
the
dreaded
time
had
arrived
when
he
must
go
out
to
his
first
company
then
a
dreadful
feeling
came
over
him
oh
i
ca
go
he
declared
his
face
turning
as
red
as
a
beet
and
he
stood
still
perfectly
miserable
why
sterling
expects
you
began
david
joel
had
no
such
gentle
ways
come
along
you
he
cried
hauling
jack
away
from
the
cabinet
and
hurrying
him
off
downstairs
then
he
began
to
chatter
as
hard
as
he
could
saying
the
first
things
that
came
into
his
head
until
the
gray
stone
mansion
was
reached
and
they
were
fast
and
safe
within
the
door
joel
drew
a
long
breath
and
began
to
mount
the
stairs
any
boys
here
yet
he
asked
looking
up
at
gibson
in
the
upper
hall
yes
said
gibson
three
boys
have
come
joel
did
wait
to
ask
who
they
were
he
left
david
to
bring
jack
along
and
raced
in
to
speak
to
sterling
and
the
members
of
the
comfort
committee
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
joel
sterling
beamed
at
him
from
her
sofa
feeling
quite
sure
of
the
success
of
the
first
company
she
had
given
to
the
boys
now
that
joel
pepper
had
come
joel
gave
her
a
bright
little
nod
then
remembering
himself
he
went
over
to
her
sofa
and
stuck
out
his
little
brown
hand
i
glad
i
come
he
said
bobbing
at
the
same
time
in
great
satisfaction
to
the
boys
where
is
your
friend
joel
asked
sterling
in
disappointment
i
surely
thought
you
would
bring
him
joel
glanced
around
in
dismay
then
pranced
out
into
the
hall
a
scuffling
noise
struck
upon
his
ear
and
leaning
over
the
banister
he
saw
david
and
jack
apparently
hanging
on
to
each
other
and
whirling
around
in
the
hall
below
he
was
down
over
the
stairs
in
a
flash
he
says
he
must
go
home
said
david
still
holding
fast
to
the
edge
of
jack
jacket
and
looking
up
with
a
very
pink
face
jack
looked
thoroughly
ashamed
but
he
still
cast
wild
eyes
at
the
big
front
door
as
joel
considering
whatever
was
to
be
done
at
all
should
be
done
quickly
launched
him
upstairs
and
before
he
had
a
moment
to
breathe
freely
pushed
him
into
the
beautiful
above
with
a
here
he
is
the
room
swam
all
around
before
jack
as
he
went
up
to
the
and
sterling
soft
white
hand
took
his
hot
nervous
one
he
did
know
in
the
least
what
she
said
or
how
she
looked
as
he
could
raise
his
eyes
but
he
remembered
afterward
that
her
voice
was
sweet
and
low
and
that
somehow
he
was
so
afraid
after
that
and
then
joel
dragged
him
into
a
knot
of
boys
for
by
this
time
several
were
pouring
into
the
room
and
in
five
minutes
jack
felt
as
if
he
had
known
them
all
for
years
and
he
quite
forgot
that
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
gone
into
company
when
the
bustle
of
the
arrival
was
over
and
every
member
of
the
comfort
committee
was
present
sterling
said
now
i
think
gibson
the
first
thing
we
should
do
is
to
have
supper
so
gibson
went
over
and
touched
the
electric
button
on
the
wall
and
in
came
the
butler
and
two
maids
bearing
trays
full
well
just
crowded
with
all
the
good
things
a
boy
could
desire
to
eat
and
these
having
been
placed
on
the
big
mahogany
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
usually
filled
with
books
and
magazines
but
which
had
been
cleared
for
the
purpose
each
boy
was
invited
to
come
up
and
be
helped
to
whatever
he
wanted
an
invitation
that
was
long
left
unaccepted
joel
in
his
fear
that
jack
would
somehow
be
left
out
in
the
cold
bent
all
his
energies
toward
getting
him
something
to
eat
the
consequence
was
that
he
forgot
all
about
waiting
on
sterling
and
glancing
around
after
he
had
poked
a
plate
of
cold
chicken
and
jelly
into
jack
hand
he
saw
two
or
three
of
the
boys
frick
and
even
little
porter
knapp
vying
with
each
other
to
be
the
first
to
serve
their
hostess
ugh
cried
joel
seizing
the
first
thing
on
the
table
that
caught
his
eye
it
proved
to
be
the
and
he
rushed
up
and
presented
it
with
a
flourish
ho
ho
exploded
frick
as
the
little
knot
of
boys
parted
in
the
middle
why
we
only
got
her
a
napkin
and
a
plate
joel
glanced
down
ruefully
at
the
in
his
hand
and
was
going
to
beat
a
retreat
with
it
quite
crestfallen
thank
you
joel
i
shall
want
it
pretty
soon
said
sterling
smiling
into
his
red
face
there
we
put
it
on
the
table
for
gibson
had
been
busy
drawing
up
a
light
stand
to
the
side
of
the
sofa
and
will
you
bring
me
some
cold
chicken
me
cried
joel
perfectly
radiant
but
scarcely
believing
that
he
could
be
meant
after
his
awkwardness
yes
you
said
sterling
laughing
so
hurry
and
get
it
joel
no
need
to
tell
him
that
joel
sprang
at
the
table
again
bore
off
a
plate
of
the
desired
delicacy
and
a
spoonful
of
currant
jelly
by
its
side
and
flew
back
again
is
that
right
he
asked
anxiously
with
a
dreadful
feeling
that
he
ought
to
have
asked
her
if
she
wanted
brown
or
white
meat
how
did
you
know
i
am
very
fond
of
white
meat
joel
asked
sterling
and
above
all
things
i
like
the
wing
do
you
cried
joel
in
a
transport
now
what
else
nothing
now
and
the
next
time
why
i
must
let
frick
and
some
of
the
other
boys
help
me
said
sterling
so
run
back
and
get
something
to
eat
yourself
joel
so
joel
with
a
mind
to
edge
up
to
see
how
jack
was
getting
on
found
to
his
amazement
that
he
was
laughing
and
talking
with
the
last
boy
with
whom
he
would
have
supposed
it
to
be
possible
curtis
park
dear
me
exclaimed
joel
to
himself
tumbling
back
instinctively
when
he
saw
that
he
was
wanted
and
he
fell
up
against
david
i
could
help
it
said
davie
who
had
been
quite
miserable
since
his
ill
success
in
getting
jack
over
the
stairs
after
joel
he
was
aimlessly
crumbling
up
a
biscuit
on
his
plate
and
eating
nothing
well
is
any
matter
said
joel
and
he
here
now
and
having
a
good
time
just
hear
him
laugh
he
added
enviously
is
that
jack
laughing
asked
david
incredulously
poking
his
head
around
the
intervening
boys
to
see
for
himself
yes
it
is
said
joel
bobbing
his
head
decidedly
oh
well
then
it
all
right
said
david
happily
so
he
ran
off
to
fill
his
plate
and
go
over
in
the
corner
to
eat
its
contents
with
a
group
of
boys
of
whom
he
was
especially
fond
joel
left
alone
was
feeling
very
dismal
when
suddenly
he
looked
over
and
caught
jack
eye
curtis
park
was
saying
something
very
jolly
joel
knew
it
was
for
he
caught
scraps
of
it
and
so
did
some
of
the
other
boys
who
pushed
up
to
hear
the
rest
but
jack
parish
evidently
did
listen
for
his
eye
had
been
anxiously
roving
around
the
room
and
just
at
that
moment
they
rested
on
joel
and
they
lighted
up
so
unmistakably
that
joel
sprang
forward
a
light
in
his
own
did
you
want
me
jack
yes
said
jack
i
did
the
words
were
not
much
but
they
seemed
to
satisfy
joel
xxvi
hamilton
dyce
a
true
friend
and
after
every
boy
protested
that
he
could
eat
another
bit
the
butler
and
the
two
maids
packed
up
the
trays
and
carried
them
down
again
now
comfort
committee
said
sterling
all
draw
up
here
so
the
circle
of
chairs
and
crickets
was
made
around
the
sofa
and
the
real
business
of
the
evening
began
it
was
in
the
very
commencement
of
things
joel
noticed
that
every
one
of
the
members
seemed
to
take
a
fancy
to
jack
curtis
park
leaned
over
from
his
chair
i
say
frick
change
places
with
me
frick
was
next
to
the
visitor
joel
of
course
being
on
his
other
side
no
you
do
said
frick
not
over
politely
oh
that
mean
began
curtis
then
he
remembered
where
he
was
and
sat
back
in
his
chair
biting
his
pencil
frick
straightened
himself
up
with
enjoyment
you
can
take
my
pencil
he
said
to
jack
magnanimously
we
all
brought
you
know
she
wanted
us
to
joel
caught
the
last
of
this
oh
dear
me
he
exclaimed
in
remorse
i
forgot
mine
and
jack
i
was
going
to
bring
one
for
you
he
can
take
mine
said
frick
shoving
a
very
stubby
specimen
into
hand
mine
better
said
curtis
reaching
over
a
one
just
sharpened
to
a
fine
point
take
mine
jack
you
much
better
jack
not
knowing
how
to
refuse
took
it
and
the
other
boys
seeing
curtis
park
come
down
from
his
notions
enough
to
notice
so
conspicuously
the
new
boy
all
began
to
find
ever
so
many
things
in
him
that
were
worthy
of
their
attention
so
instead
of
joel
having
to
push
him
along
jack
became
quite
popular
the
result
was
that
joel
was
left
out
in
the
cold
now
said
sterling
brightly
after
a
little
of
this
chat
had
been
going
on
and
gibson
had
shaken
up
her
pillows
and
raised
her
mistress
into
a
more
comfortable
position
you
all
know
of
course
that
doctor
fisher
reports
lawrence
ready
for
a
little
amusement
if
we
send
it
to
him
for
no
one
is
allowed
yet
to
see
him
but
we
will
be
soon
doctor
fisher
told
my
father
so
yesterday
piped
out
porter
knapp
sliding
to
the
edge
of
his
chair
i
do
doubt
it
said
sterling
smiling
at
him
but
until
that
good
time
does
come
why
we
who
belong
to
the
comfort
committee
ought
to
set
to
work
on
something
that
will
cheer
him
up
and
as
i
believe
work
of
that
kind
always
gets
along
better
when
ever
so
many
club
together
at
it
why
i
thought
i
ask
you
all
to
meet
here
and
we
see
what
could
be
done
this
evening
now
what
shall
we
do
first
she
looked
all
around
the
circle
but
no
one
spoke
oh
dear
me
she
said
and
her
face
fell
i
rather
write
out
conundrums
than
anything
else
said
curtis
park
seeing
some
answer
was
expected
good
sterling
beamed
on
him
does
any
other
boy
have
something
to
propose
puzzles
said
frick
decidedly
i
a
great
deal
rather
have
puzzles
conundrums
are
just
horrid
two
things
to
choose
from
and
sterling
laughed
her
spirits
were
rising
now
and
all
the
doubts
she
was
beginning
to
feel
overwhelming
her
as
to
the
wisdom
of
inviting
these
boys
in
for
the
evening
fled
at
once
i
think
puzzles
are
just
as
horrid
as
conundrums
said
joel
pepper
beginning
already
to
feel
the
prickles
run
up
and
down
his
legs
from
sitting
still
so
long
and
wishing
for
nothing
so
much
as
a
good
scamper
they
both
as
horrid
as
they
can
be
oh
joel
exclaimed
sterling
quite
crestfallen
well
propose
something
yourself
then
joe
said
his
next
neighbor
with
a
nudge
oh
i
ca
said
joel
quite
horrified
i
do
know
anything
that
we
can
write
down
jack
leaned
over
and
whispered
in
his
ear
the
very
thing
cried
joel
slapping
his
knee
and
tell
it
yourself
jack
in
the
next
breath
oh
no
no
protested
jack
shrinking
as
far
back
in
his
chair
as
he
could
and
getting
very
red
in
the
face
i
very
much
wish
you
would
jack
said
sterling
and
she
looked
at
him
in
such
a
way
that
jack
although
he
had
wild
thoughts
of
taking
a
flying
leap
out
of
his
chair
and
off
to
the
small
grocery
shop
nevertheless
stuck
to
it
manfully
and
at
last
found
his
tongue
we
might
cut
out
pictures
that
spell
the
names
of
books
he
said
capital
said
sterling
well
those
are
puzzles
said
frick
well
not
like
the
ones
you
meant
said
joel
leaning
back
of
jack
to
bestow
a
punch
do
be
still
he
added
furiously
but
mine
would
be
puzzles
anyway
declared
frick
unwilling
to
give
up
the
point
well
we
much
rather
have
these
anyway
said
curtis
park
projecting
himself
into
as
much
of
the
circle
as
possible
who
cares
for
your
old
puzzles
frick
boys
boys
said
sterling
gently
beg
pardon
said
curtis
but
we
really
do
want
these
that
jack
has
just
proposed
sterling
at
least
i
do
and
i
give
up
conundrums
to
have
them
so
please
let
us
have
these
how
is
it
frick
asked
sterling
do
you
give
up
your
puzzles
in
favor
of
our
making
jack
pictures
frick
wriggled
in
his
chair
he
wanted
his
puzzles
dreadfully
and
he
could
see
since
he
had
proposed
them
first
why
he
should
carry
the
day
but
every
boy
was
looking
at
him
sharply
so
he
mumbled
yes
it
was
jack
who
settled
it
happily
after
all
let
have
one
of
his
bobbing
his
head
at
frick
and
a
conundrum
and
he
looked
over
and
smiled
at
curtis
then
one
of
mine
after
that
that
do
well
now
jack
you
fixed
it
cleverly
said
sterling
much
relieved
get
your
pencils
all
ready
while
gibson
goes
into
my
bedroom
and
brings
out
the
pile
of
magazines
and
we
have
such
a
lovely
evening
of
work
you
know
you
must
each
select
pictures
and
each
write
a
puzzle
and
each
give
a
conundrum
then
they
must
be
read
aloud
and
we
will
choose
the
very
best
ones
to
send
now
then
as
gibson
deposited
her
armful
of
magazines
on
the
little
stand
and
laid
several
pairs
of
scissors
on
the
top
of
the
pile
let
us
all
set
about
it
then
what
a
whirling
of
leaves
and
snipping
of
paper
because
they
all
decided
they
would
begin
on
jack
first
ca
we
have
some
mucilage
asked
joel
yes
indeed
said
sterling
gibson
will
you
get
boom
boom
clang
clang
clang
it
was
the
loud
and
clear
and
strong
down
went
all
the
scissors
and
a
whole
litter
of
papers
to
the
floor
and
the
magazines
sprawled
every
way
as
each
boy
sprang
out
of
his
chair
gibson
said
sterling
faintly
now
you
boys
cried
gibson
hurrying
in
her
cap
strings
flying
in
her
perturbation
do
you
know
no
better
than
to
jump
up
like
that
gibson
gibson
said
sterling
reprovingly
but
she
laid
her
hand
on
her
heart
it
a
fire
cried
joel
with
very
red
cheeks
whirling
around
from
the
window
where
the
mass
of
boys
was
pressed
well
is
that
any
reason
why
you
should
act
so
and
scare
the
mistress
to
death
said
gibson
sharply
we
did
scare
her
said
joel
bluntly
it
was
the
fire
well
we
must
go
declared
little
porter
knapp
struggling
out
from
the
knot
of
boys
who
all
bigger
and
stronger
were
pinning
him
against
the
window
most
uncomfortably
oh
he
must
sterling
said
in
alarm
his
father
would
like
it
at
all
he
was
to
stay
here
until
he
was
sent
for
it
a
fire
exclaimed
porter
kicking
dreadfully
and
his
face
getting
red
and
i
go
the
other
boys
just
on
the
edge
of
saying
the
same
thing
now
stood
quite
still
every
nerve
was
quivering
to
be
off
to
the
fire
which
from
all
appearances
must
be
a
splendid
one
the
bells
were
clanging
fast
and
furiously
hoarse
cries
were
heard
as
if
raised
from
hundreds
of
throats
and
now
to
add
to
the
general
melee
an
engine
dashed
around
the
corner
they
could
hear
the
mad
plunge
of
the
horses
the
shouts
of
the
people
and
then
off
in
the
distance
yet
approaching
nearer
each
instant
was
another
and
evidently
a
more
powerful
one
the
horses
at
a
mad
gallop
it
was
too
much
for
any
boy
to
stand
you
see
we
go
curtis
park
went
over
to
the
sofa
and
said
this
hoarsely
he
a
baby
pointing
to
porter
and
he
got
to
stay
here
but
we
big
boys
must
go
sterling
looked
up
and
her
face
grew
white
but
your
fathers
would
wish
you
to
go
i
am
quite
sure
she
said
curtis
turned
away
his
face
but
his
teeth
were
set
i
going
he
said
briefly
jack
parish
head
spun
and
he
clenched
his
hands
why
had
he
come
to
this
sick
woman
house
if
he
were
only
out
in
the
free
open
air
he
go
in
a
flash
his
father
let
him
run
to
fires
and
it
would
be
many
minutes
before
he
be
in
the
thick
of
it
he
make
a
break
and
run
but
how
white
she
looked
as
she
laid
her
head
on
the
pillow
like
it
or
not
there
he
was
in
her
house
an
invited
guest
and
she
been
so
kind
to
him
and
sent
him
the
first
invitation
he
ever
had
he
opened
his
hard
fists
and
closed
them
tighter
than
ever
curtis
park
was
now
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
having
decided
he
was
bolting
off
little
porter
knapp
was
engaged
in
kicking
gibson
who
was
detaining
him
by
the
end
of
his
jacket
and
screaming
wrathfully
and
slapping
her
hands
the
other
boys
most
of
them
making
up
their
minds
to
follow
curtis
were
watching
proceedings
jack
strode
off
to
curtis
see
here
he
said
we
ought
not
to
go
you
know
curtis
turned
on
him
in
a
towering
passion
you
let
me
alone
you
boy
you
what
business
is
it
of
yours
i
may
be
a
grocer
boy
said
jack
feeling
himself
wonder
fully
cool
as
the
other
anger
raged
but
i
know
something
of
good
manners
and
we
scaring
that
lady
to
death
curtis
park
was
dreadfully
proud
of
his
manners
and
he
would
have
stopped
there
but
as
it
again
occurred
to
him
that
this
was
the
son
of
a
grocer
who
was
setting
up
to
be
an
authority
he
cried
angrily
you
a
great
one
to
teach
me
manners
and
he
dashed
down
the
stairs
and
was
out
of
the
house
i
wish
i
stopped
him
said
jack
to
himself
hello
here
the
whole
mob
as
all
the
boys
except
joel
and
david
and
of
course
porter
now
plunged
out
to
do
the
same
thing
no
you
do
he
squared
up
in
front
of
the
staircase
not
one
of
you
goes
down
there
they
brought
up
with
a
gasp
at
that
instant
a
cheery
voice
in
the
hall
below
rang
out
hello
boys
i
knew
you
were
to
be
here
tonight
do
you
want
to
come
with
me
to
the
fire
it
was
hamilton
dyce
to
whom
the
voice
belonged
and
in
five
minutes
hamilton
dyce
set
forth
with
sterling
complete
approval
a
string
of
boys
in
his
wake
including
little
porter
who
was
parted
from
gibson
only
on
her
hearing
her
mistress
say
yes
indeed
he
can
go
but
do
look
out
for
him
dyce
nodded
over
to
her
couch
come
on
you
little
rascal
to
porter
you
stick
close
to
me
or
he
did
finish
the
sentence
gibson
pale
and
shaking
in
every
limb
but
seeing
no
reason
to
regret
that
she
had
hung
on
to
little
porter
jacket
sank
into
a
chair
and
simply
looked
at
her
mistress
nevertheless
said
sterling
with
a
long
breath
and
beginning
to
smile
i
am
very
glad
those
boys
were
here
to
supper
if
her
mistress
could
smile
it
was
so
very
black
and
dreadful
after
all
and
gibson
came
enough
out
of
her
gloom
to
mutter
but
look
at
this
room
and
she
waved
her
hands
in
despair
oh
that
nothing
said
sterling
cheerfully
and
then
she
laughed
outright
as
she
glanced
around
at
the
effects
of
the
tumult
gibson
come
here
a
minute
the
old
crept
out
of
her
chair
and
went
over
to
the
sofa
do
you
know
sterling
took
her
arm
and
pulled
her
gently
down
to
a
level
with
the
face
on
the
pillow
and
her
soft
eyes
twinkled
it
really
seems
good
to
see
such
a
muss
for
once
in
my
life
you
do
keep
me
so
immaculately
fine
gibson
oh
mistress
breathed
gibson
aghast
and
to
think
i
have
had
boys
actually
young
life
here
in
this
room
sterling
raised
herself
suddenly
to
rest
on
one
elbow
mistress
mistress
implored
the
alarmed
gibson
with
restraining
hands
you
hurt
yourself
no
i
sha
protested
sterling
her
eyes
beaming
and
going
on
resolutely
and
just
to
think
of
boys
being
here
she
looked
around
the
room
with
a
sudden
affection
and
liking
it
for
they
did
gibson
they
surely
did
until
the
fire
started
oh
it
is
perfectly
beautiful
well
do
lie
back
mistress
begged
gibson
thumping
up
the
pillows
invitingly
else
those
dreadful
creatures
will
finish
you
entirely
do
say
so
cried
sterling
laughingly
and
i
will
be
good
and
she
settled
back
comfortably
into
her
accustomed
place
yes
gibson
i
have
my
young
folks
now
the
same
as
other
people
she
added
proudly
you
need
try
to
fix
up
the
room
yet
you
may
finish
the
story
you
were
reading
to
me
last
night
she
had
to
turn
her
face
on
the
pillow
for
the
smile
would
come
at
the
picture
of
gibson
the
immaculate
sitting
down
calmly
in
the
midst
of
the
awful
effects
of
the
tumult
that
had
so
vexed
her
soul
she
had
her
young
people
there
was
no
manner
of
doubt
after
that
and
though
the
exit
from
their
evening
excitement
was
not
again
made
to
the
clang
of
the
all
the
subsequent
visits
held
fun
and
jollity
and
quiet
enjoyment
and
everything
else
that
was
delightful
mixed
up
together
and
the
comfort
committee
had
so
much
pleasure
out
of
the
whole
thing
that
one
evening
little
porter
looked
up
from
his
laborious
pasting
whereby
a
joke
from
a
funny
paper
was
going
down
for
the
sick
boy
amusement
i
wish
some
one
else
would
get
hurt
he
said
abruptly
without
stopping
to
think
oh
you
beggar
it
was
curtis
park
who
turned
on
him
though
every
boy
had
glanced
up
in
surprise
we
ca
have
such
fun
said
porter
waving
his
sticky
hands
in
both
directions
unless
they
do
and
he
twisted
uncomfortably
in
his
chair
as
he
realized
the
effect
of
his
words
well
we
must
think
of
somebody
else
to
help
with
our
comfort
committee
said
sterling
from
her
sofa
do
worry
porter
we
wo
let
ourselves
die
out
for
want
of
work
boys
she
looked
at
them
suddenly
and
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
gibson
over
in
her
watchful
corner
trotting
across
in
great
apprehension
mistress
mistress
she
began
there
are
ever
so
many
young
people
who
are
hurt
and
sick
and
distressed
and
are
taken
right
out
of
life
she
was
gazing
at
them
now
with
eyes
that
were
large
and
dark
and
shining
but
we
do
know
them
burst
out
joel
pepper
for
she
seemed
to
expect
somebody
to
answer
no
but
they
need
you
mistress
mistress
begged
gibson
hanging
over
her
and
if
you
do
the
work
after
lawrence
does
need
it
and
he
is
here
with
us
well
and
happy
once
more
i
will
see
that
some
sick
or
unhappy
boy
gets
it
joel
pepper
hopped
out
of
his
chair
upsetting
the
mucilage
bottle
seeing
which
gibson
left
her
mistress
to
reach
the
table
in
time
to
save
a
disaster
will
you
will
you
he
cried
running
over
to
the
sofa
will
you
give
our
things
if
we
make
them
to
some
poor
sick
boys
who
are
hurt
mrs
sterling
i
surely
will
joel
promised
sterling
taking
his
two
brown
hands
in
her
thin
one
then
i
going
to
make
things
declared
joel
who
never
in
his
life
before
had
been
willing
to
sit
still
and
cut
out
and
snip
and
paste
and
write
and
he
plunged
back
to
his
seat
oh
he
cried
in
dismay
and
his
face
grew
terribly
red
did
i
upset
that
pointing
to
the
mucilage
bottle
you
surely
did
said
gibson
tartly
and
taking
up
the
last
of
the
sticky
mess
with
a
wet
towel
and
i
suppose
you
do
it
again
or
some
of
the
rest
of
you
boys
will
it
do
make
much
difference
which
and
she
moved
off
slowly
gibson
gibson
said
sterling
gently
oh
gibson
joel
flew
after
her
and
twitched
her
apron
string
what
is
it
she
turned
on
him
with
asperity
i
never
will
upset
the
mucilage
bottle
again
i
wo
gibson
really
see
that
you
do
replied
gibson
moving
off
with
small
faith
in
such
promises
and
another
promise
had
that
very
evening
been
made
just
before
the
boys
had
gathered
in
sterling
handsome
curtis
park
had
been
through
several
spasms
of
distress
over
his
attack
on
jack
when
whirling
around
from
the
friendly
attitude
he
had
chosen
to
assume
he
had
made
a
tirade
on
the
grocer
son
look
at
it
whichever
way
he
might
it
did
seem
pleasant
to
view
and
all
the
delight
in
the
fire
and
the
companionship
of
dyce
of
whom
all
the
boys
were
exceedingly
fond
was
suddenly
blotted
out
he
went
home
that
night
and
crept
into
bed
a
most
disconsolate
boy
i
was
a
beastly
cad
he
fumed
kicking
the
covering
down
to
the
foot
and
rolling
out
with
the
vain
attempt
to
find
some
diversion
but
that
being
impossible
he
tumbled
in
again
with
his
unhappy
thoughts
and
all
through
the
following
days
go
whichever
way
he
might
there
was
the
fact
to
stare
him
in
the
face
that
he
curtis
park
who
had
hitherto
prided
himself
upon
his
fine
manners
had
dropped
from
his
height
to
blackguard
a
boy
who
despite
the
fact
of
having
been
born
the
son
of
a
little
grocer
on
common
street
had
yet
shown
himself
capable
of
the
height
it
no
use
to
deny
it
i
been
a
bully
and
a
cad
he
groaned
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
face
what
can
i
do
there
was
only
one
way
and
he
knew
it
just
as
well
at
first
as
after
all
the
fencing
with
himself
that
ensued
the
next
few
days
and
at
last
on
this
very
evening
he
stopped
fighting
the
idea
and
marched
up
to
what
it
suggested
like
a
man
see
here
will
you
though
i
should
think
you
want
to
speak
to
me
it
was
a
boy
who
said
this
to
jack
standing
on
the
step
of
the
front
door
next
to
the
shop
hey
said
jack
in
a
great
bewilderment
was
that
really
curtis
park
whose
rap
on
the
door
had
announced
him
oh
it
no
use
to
deny
jack
said
curtis
speaking
rapidly
and
desperately
that
i
been
a
cad
a
mean
low
cad
to
talk
to
you
in
that
way
it
done
and
ca
be
helped
now
only
i
want
you
to
know
what
i
think
of
it
jack
swallowed
hard
he
was
going
to
put
out
his
hand
but
luckily
thought
in
time
this
is
curtis
park
i
do
wonder
you
wo
shake
hands
with
me
said
curtis
who
saw
the
movement
i
no
end
sorry
and
perhaps
sometime
jack
why
you
will
jack
brown
hand
shot
out
so
swiftly
it
nearly
knocked
the
other
boy
from
the
doorstep
it
all
right
he
said
heartily
and
you
will
never
have
another
chance
to
call
me
a
cad
i
promise
you
declared
curtis
wringing
it
come
on
now
jack
hooking
him
by
the
arm
it
time
to
go
to
sterling
this
is
the
evening
you
know
and
the
boys
who
had
begun
to
think
they
had
made
a
mistake
in
supposing
that
curtis
park
had
taken
a
fancy
to
jack
parish
were
pushed
back
into
their
first
conviction
by
seeing
them
come
into
the
meeting
of
the
comfort
committee
arm
in
arm
xxvii
a
piece
of
good
news
polly
pepper
ran
down
the
steps
of
miss
taylor
house
and
set
off
at
a
lively
pace
on
the
pavement
presently
she
came
to
an
abrupt
stop
oh
how
could
i
forget
mamsie
would
like
me
to
run
in
the
street
she
thought
remorsefully
and
this
took
away
some
of
the
glad
little
thrills
running
over
her
when
she
got
to
cummings
very
select
on
the
avenue
there
was
miss
rhys
at
the
window
of
her
room
looking
up
from
her
embroidery
when
she
saw
polly
pepper
she
smiled
oh
it
you
polly
i
glad
to
see
you
is
alexia
there
called
polly
looking
up
and
feeling
her
lovely
bit
of
news
dancing
within
her
again
so
that
she
could
hardly
control
her
impatience
do
tell
her
to
come
out
please
miss
rhys
she
is
here
she
went
miss
rhys
laid
her
precious
work
in
her
lap
and
put
her
face
close
to
the
window
screen
her
candy
was
a
success
and
she
gone
down
for
more
confectioner
sugar
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
polly
quite
gone
in
distress
over
the
failure
of
the
candy
and
feeling
very
helpless
in
the
fact
that
there
was
no
one
to
tell
her
news
to
for
of
course
alexia
must
be
the
first
one
to
hear
it
which
way
did
she
go
miss
rhys
lifting
a
troubled
face
to
the
window
above
i
do
know
said
miss
rhys
absently
her
mind
on
her
embroidery
and
very
much
wishing
she
could
return
to
it
she
was
going
to
your
house
i
know
for
one
thing
on
her
way
down
oh
she
could
have
gone
there
cried
polly
for
i
should
have
met
her
on
the
way
so
you
would
assented
alexia
aunt
wondering
whether
the
bunch
of
grapes
should
be
filled
in
solid
or
worked
with
the
mixed
stitch
that
she
had
seen
in
a
shop
well
then
i
think
on
her
way
back
she
was
going
to
see
you
polly
then
i
am
going
to
run
down
and
meet
her
declared
polly
with
a
long
breath
was
it
pennsey
where
she
was
going
for
the
sugar
miss
rhys
pausing
a
moment
yes
said
miss
rhys
turning
back
with
a
sigh
of
relief
to
her
embroidery
again
while
polly
hurried
off
wishing
that
she
was
a
boy
when
it
would
be
quite
proper
for
her
to
run
through
the
streets
oh
if
it
were
only
badgertown
she
sighed
to
herself
thinking
of
the
many
happy
runs
she
had
enjoyed
down
the
lane
to
grandma
bascom
cottage
or
over
across
the
fields
to
the
parsonage
dear
me
when
a
voice
polly
pepper
pol
ly
pepper
called
after
her
she
looked
back
and
there
with
the
window
screen
up
and
her
face
thrust
well
forward
was
alexia
aunt
loudly
summoning
her
when
she
saw
that
polly
heard
and
had
turned
back
she
beckoned
smartly
with
her
long
fingers
on
which
shone
as
alexia
had
once
said
all
the
rings
the
rhys
family
had
ever
owned
drew
in
her
head
and
waited
till
polly
came
up
under
the
window
again
oh
polly
it
just
this
how
fortunate
you
had
gotten
far
i
want
you
to
tell
alexia
to
get
me
some
more
green
floss
at
miss
angell
yes
miss
rhys
said
polly
with
a
dismayed
remembrance
just
how
far
it
was
to
the
little
shop
where
the
very
latest
patterns
and
materials
for
fancy
work
could
be
obtained
and
the
first
supper
of
the
cooking
club
to
be
given
and
stay
miss
angell
may
send
me
up
some
more
patterns
to
choose
from
that
is
if
she
has
had
any
new
ones
since
i
was
there
last
week
and
i
presume
that
she
has
polly
could
only
utter
yes
miss
rhys
so
very
faintly
it
could
scarcely
be
heard
dear
me
and
it
was
three
already
and
all
that
candy
to
be
made
over
again
she
crept
off
on
very
dismal
feet
till
she
reflected
it
would
help
matters
any
to
lose
heart
and
so
she
set
forward
at
a
brisk
pace
again
miss
rhys
pushed
down
the
window
screen
and
set
to
work
with
a
complacent
smile
at
the
prospect
of
having
her
errand
performed
so
nicely
that
the
good
of
having
young
people
around
she
said
it
so
convenient
at
times
to
get
one
errands
done
polly
went
the
whole
length
of
north
street
to
the
great
establishment
of
pennsey
where
the
avenue
people
traded
but
search
as
she
might
up
one
aisle
and
down
another
there
was
no
trace
of
alexia
and
inquiring
of
a
clerk
at
the
sugar
department
if
she
had
been
there
he
whipped
his
pencil
out
from
behind
his
ear
and
picked
up
his
order
pad
before
he
stopped
to
think
she
just
gone
he
said
yes
madam
all
attention
to
the
next
customer
polly
hurried
on
rapid
feet
it
was
three
by
the
big
central
clock
as
she
went
down
the
main
aisle
well
she
must
hurry
home
for
alexia
was
probably
on
her
way
there
as
miss
rhys
had
said
when
dear
me
polly
pepper
wait
struck
her
ear
she
turned
and
there
before
an
opposite
counter
was
alexia
picking
up
her
package
of
sugar
and
preparing
to
race
after
her
i
getting
some
more
nuts
she
said
my
candy
was
perfectly
horrid
and
everything
was
spoiled
yes
i
know
said
polly
coming
up
close
to
comfort
as
much
as
possible
for
alexia
had
a
very
long
face
on
and
looked
as
if
it
would
take
a
good
deal
to
cheer
her
up
how
can
i
tell
her
about
that
dreadful
green
floss
and
those
patterns
said
polly
over
and
over
to
herself
i
must
wait
till
we
get
out
on
the
street
but
when
the
two
girls
were
outside
the
shop
polly
carrying
the
bundle
of
nuts
tucked
under
her
arm
it
was
just
as
bad
and
she
put
it
off
until
the
corner
was
reached
down
which
they
must
turn
to
go
to
miss
angell
and
worst
of
all
they
were
hurrying
on
so
fast
the
lovely
bit
of
news
must
be
postponed
how
glad
i
am
aunt
did
take
it
into
her
head
to
send
me
spinning
off
down
there
observed
alexia
glancing
down
the
long
thoroughfare
with
anything
but
a
pleasant
expression
on
her
long
face
i
just
hate
that
miss
angell
shop
goodness
me
we
never
could
do
it
with
all
this
candy
to
make
and
get
our
club
supper
polly
stopped
short
and
seized
alexia
arm
oh
do
feel
badly
she
gasped
and
then
thinking
it
better
to
have
the
whole
out
at
once
she
finished
in
one
breath
your
aunt
wants
some
green
floss
alexia
well
she
sha
have
it
declared
alexia
stopping
short
too
and
glaring
at
polly
over
her
bundle
of
sugar
no
indeed
and
her
pale
eyes
grew
very
angry
the
very
idea
she
always
wanting
green
floss
every
single
minute
come
on
polly
pepper
she
set
her
face
straight
ahead
and
marched
on
but
not
hearing
polly
following
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
then
ran
back
why
do
you
come
on
i
sha
get
that
old
green
floss
all
in
one
breath
we
can
get
there
in
a
few
minutes
perhaps
said
polly
alexia
do
let
us
hurry
and
turning
down
the
corner
without
so
much
as
a
glance
backward
she
went
swiftly
on
without
trusting
herself
to
look
down
the
long
street
i
sha
get
that
old
green
floss
declared
alexia
wrathfully
standing
quite
still
on
the
corner
yet
as
polly
kept
steadily
on
showing
no
intention
of
stopping
she
pattered
after
but
she
kept
saying
every
step
of
the
way
i
sha
get
that
old
green
floss
polly
but
it
was
not
until
the
door
of
miss
angell
shop
was
reached
that
the
two
girls
came
together
it
a
hateful
mean
shame
exploded
alexia
huddling
up
her
bundle
of
sugar
passionately
there
i
punched
a
hole
with
my
thumb
see
what
you
made
me
do
polly
turned
around
in
dismay
to
see
a
little
trail
of
fine
sugar
drifting
from
the
package
down
over
alexia
gown
oh
dear
me
she
exclaimed
in
dismay
i
help
you
stand
still
alexia
do
it
all
running
out
well
you
made
me
cried
alexia
whirling
around
and
wildly
patting
the
bag
in
just
the
wrong
places
so
that
the
stream
of
sugar
became
now
quite
big
do
stand
still
alexia
implored
polly
here
i
pinch
it
up
she
set
down
her
bundle
of
nuts
on
the
top
step
which
a
lady
not
seeing
came
out
of
the
shop
and
promptly
fell
over
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
polly
in
terror
and
running
down
the
steps
did
you
hurt
you
oh
i
so
sorry
clasping
her
hands
and
looking
the
picture
of
distress
then
she
saw
it
was
patterson
a
friend
of
auntie
whitney
no
said
the
lady
tartly
getting
up
to
her
feet
to
draw
a
long
breath
and
gaze
up
and
down
the
street
why
polly
pepper
bringing
her
gaze
upon
the
flushed
face
are
you
sure
you
are
not
hurt
mrs
patterson
polly
looked
at
her
anxiously
oh
dear
me
how
could
she
be
so
careless
not
a
bit
of
it
declared
that
lady
but
oh
polly
do
you
suppose
any
one
saw
me
and
she
gazed
ruefully
up
and
down
the
street
again
i
do
believe
any
one
did
said
polly
peering
this
way
and
that
polly
do
come
this
sugar
is
all
running
away
cried
alexia
loudly
and
do
let
me
brush
your
gown
implored
polly
feeling
as
if
everything
were
going
wrong
this
afternoon
never
mind
i
going
directly
home
here
is
the
carriage
said
patterson
as
her
handsome
equipage
drew
up
do
you
worry
a
bit
polly
pepper
i
not
in
the
least
hurt
and
off
she
drove
polly
will
you
come
called
alexia
dancing
about
impatiently
on
the
top
step
and
clutching
the
bag
of
sugar
with
nervous
ringers
that
did
help
matters
any
oh
dear
me
do
look
pointing
tragically
to
the
little
pile
of
sweetness
at
her
feet
oh
i
do
hope
she
was
hurt
cried
polly
stumbling
up
over
the
steps
how
she
did
know
oh
that
tiresome
patterson
well
it
will
do
her
good
to
tumble
down
once
in
a
while
said
alexia
unsympathetically
she
so
stiff
and
mighty
and
i
should
think
you
might
pay
some
attention
to
me
she
cried
in
a
loud
injured
tone
i
all
in
a
mess
with
this
sugar
and
i
got
any
candy
and
you
made
me
come
clear
down
to
this
old
shop
and
well
do
come
in
cried
polly
interrupting
her
stream
of
complaint
and
picking
up
the
bag
of
nuts
before
any
one
else
could
tumble
over
it
she
hurried
alexia
into
the
little
shop
and
i
glad
enough
to
get
where
i
can
lay
this
old
thing
down
declared
alexia
dumping
the
bag
of
sugar
upon
the
first
she
saw
an
aesthetic
little
lounge
covered
with
elaborately
embroidered
pieces
oh
me
my
arms
are
almost
broken
and
she
stretched
them
restfully
and
beside
the
sugar
is
all
run
out
oh
alexia
cried
polly
quite
aghast
as
she
saw
where
alexia
had
deposited
the
sugar
just
as
the
proprietor
of
the
shop
hurried
up
with
dismay
written
all
over
her
countenance
oh
my
beautiful
centerpieces
she
exclaimed
raising
both
hands
in
dismay
i
am
sure
they
are
quite
quite
ruined
it
nothing
but
sugar
grumbled
alexia
as
she
huddled
up
her
bundle
again
and
i
brush
it
all
off
said
polly
anxiously
bestowing
little
pats
over
the
various
specimens
of
fancy
work
see
miss
angell
i
believe
it
hurt
she
said
lifting
her
flushed
face
well
i
do
wish
them
declared
two
ladies
together
coming
back
from
the
small
table
where
they
had
gone
to
examine
more
work
they
are
quite
mussed
and
tumbled
now
added
one
and
not
at
all
what
we
want
come
sister
and
she
walked
to
the
door
viewing
with
disfavor
alexia
and
her
bundle
and
polly
pepper
as
well
miss
angell
face
dropped
to
such
a
length
that
polly
could
bear
to
look
at
it
oh
please
do
go
cried
polly
flying
after
the
irate
customer
i
do
really
believe
the
pretty
things
are
hurt
do
just
come
back
and
see
please
the
other
lady
was
standing
irresolutely
by
the
lounge
but
she
even
look
at
the
centerpieces
that
miss
angell
was
smoothing
out
with
a
despairing
hand
preparing
to
put
them
into
their
boxes
again
it
was
clean
sugar
polly
ran
on
feeling
quite
sure
if
she
stopped
talking
that
all
hope
was
lost
but
they
are
mussed
began
the
lady
by
the
door
very
decidedly
alexia
was
huddling
up
her
bundle
quite
gone
in
despair
and
lost
to
all
the
distress
of
having
no
candy
to
take
to
the
cooking
club
supper
if
those
two
ladies
would
only
buy
the
centerpieces
they
had
selected
it
was
all
she
hoped
for
in
this
world
no
indeed
come
sister
and
she
opened
the
door
why
mrs
alexander
alexander
a
portly
person
with
a
great
deal
of
black
jet
and
lace
that
seemed
to
be
always
catching
in
the
apparel
of
those
who
passed
her
worked
her
way
into
the
small
shop
and
up
past
the
knot
of
people
giving
friendly
nods
of
recognition
on
her
way
how
d
do
miss
ellicott
miss
juliana
how
are
you
polly
and
alexia
how
is
your
aunt
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
she
sprang
if
such
a
ponderous
body
could
be
said
to
spring
at
the
box
of
centerpieces
miss
angell
was
packing
away
oh
oh
how
beautiful
stop
laying
her
large
hand
on
one
just
what
i
want
how
much
is
it
fifteen
dollars
said
miss
angell
whipping
it
neatly
out
of
the
box
her
dismal
frown
becoming
an
expansive
smile
yes
it
is
a
beauty
one
of
the
very
latest
things
and
she
spread
it
forth
on
the
lounge
with
an
experienced
little
nourish
miss
ellicott
deserted
the
door
and
hurried
over
to
the
lounge
i
i
as
she
tried
to
work
herself
in
between
but
the
portly
alexander
had
no
idea
of
being
interrupted
at
such
an
important
crisis
in
life
when
centerpieces
were
to
be
decided
upon
so
she
loudly
kept
on
in
her
bargaining
i
take
it
she
said
in
her
most
decided
fashion
and
the
next
one
too
i
fancy
let
me
see
that
but
that
is
gasped
miss
juliana
threading
her
way
into
the
group
the
very
one
that
i
liked
eh
said
alexander
looking
up
with
the
acute
eyes
of
a
oh
i
do
wonder
you
like
it
it
a
beauty
yes
take
it
also
how
much
did
you
say
it
was
miss
angell
miss
angell
who
had
said
saw
no
reason
why
she
should
now
make
it
any
price
that
appealed
to
her
better
judgment
twenty
dollars
she
answered
clapping
on
a
cool
third
of
its
price
and
alexander
who
cared
very
little
what
she
paid
for
it
beamed
at
her
and
said
put
them
in
a
box
and
send
it
out
to
my
carriage
they
are
the
handsomest
things
i
seen
for
a
long
time
and
so
wonderfully
cheap
you
are
quite
right
they
are
beauties
if
you
done
as
i
wanted
you
to
cried
miss
juliana
the
tears
of
vexation
gathering
in
her
eyes
as
she
saw
the
now
incomparable
bits
of
fancy
work
borne
off
before
their
very
faces
you
would
have
stopped
for
such
a
trifle
as
a
few
crumbs
of
sugar
sister
miss
ellicott
face
was
very
red
but
she
knew
better
than
to
show
the
chagrin
she
felt
to
add
to
the
delight
of
the
purchaser
over
her
bargain
so
she
contented
herself
with
saying
as
she
stalked
to
the
door
you
said
you
did
want
them
juliana
the
same
as
i
did
but
i
was
so
set
about
it
said
miss
juliana
with
a
regretful
glance
at
the
box
now
gayly
tied
up
by
the
jubilant
miss
angell
and
delivered
into
the
hands
of
the
little
to
be
given
to
the
alexander
footman
and
i
sure
if
you
had
insisted
i
should
have
seen
that
they
were
hurt
well
do
come
on
now
juliana
said
her
sister
sharply
in
all
the
anguish
of
having
the
whole
blame
deposited
upon
her
person
since
the
things
are
gone
what
is
the
use
of
talking
about
the
matter
as
they
disappeared
out
of
the
shop
polly
and
alexia
therefore
had
to
wait
for
all
this
confusion
and
excitement
to
clear
away
before
the
green
floss
could
be
bought
and
the
message
from
miss
rhys
as
to
the
patterns
could
be
given
meanwhile
polly
was
tying
up
the
package
of
sugar
and
patting
the
shrunken
paper
bag
into
shape
over
the
hole
you
tell
your
aunt
said
miss
angell
her
cheeks
quite
flushed
with
elation
over
her
good
bargain
that
i
have
any
more
patterns
come
in
since
she
was
here
yes
alexander
to
that
lady
with
her
head
over
a
drawer
deep
in
a
hunt
for
more
there
are
some
exquisite
designs
among
those
there
the
floss
bunching
it
up
hurriedly
into
a
wad
and
speaking
all
in
one
breath
would
you
mind
miss
alexia
doing
this
up
yourself
pointing
to
the
white
tissue
paper
on
the
table
alexia
who
did
mind
anything
so
long
as
she
could
get
out
of
the
shop
twisted
up
the
floss
into
a
wad
of
the
paper
do
hurry
polly
she
cried
and
scampered
out
to
the
street
polly
following
with
her
bag
of
nuts
oh
dear
i
forgotten
that
tiresome
old
bundle
of
sugar
after
all
she
cried
prancing
back
i
carry
it
and
you
take
the
nuts
said
polly
cramming
her
bundle
into
the
long
arms
and
getting
anxious
fingers
on
the
bag
of
sugar
as
alexia
came
running
up
with
it
i
sure
i
wish
you
would
said
alexia
seizing
the
nuts
delightedly
i
just
hate
that
old
polly
pepper
it
four
as
the
church
bell
on
stephen
tower
pealed
out
so
polly
did
have
a
chance
after
all
to
tell
her
glad
piece
of
news
until
they
were
at
the
club
supper
which
was
to
be
given
at
larry
to
celebrate
his
getting
well
oh
alexia
she
was
guilty
of
whispering
it
the
most
splendid
thing
is
it
cried
alexia
in
the
greatest
satisfaction
to
think
i
got
it
done
after
all
our
fright
and
it
the
best
candy
i
ever
made
glancing
over
the
room
where
the
dish
was
being
passed
about
eagerly
yes
i
know
said
polly
carelessly
but
this
is
much
better
than
candy
alexia
that
i
mean
much
better
than
candy
echoed
alexia
laying
clown
the
slice
of
sponge
cake
that
clem
had
made
on
her
plate
and
peering
around
into
face
what
do
you
mean
polly
pepper
there
ca
anything
possibly
be
better
than
candy
yes
there
can
contradicted
polly
twisting
in
delight
on
her
chair
and
you
say
so
when
you
hear
it
it
the
most
beautiful
thing
that
could
possibly
have
happened
alexia
rhys
it
and
just
then
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
miss
mary
taylor
and
hamilton
dyce
and
the
first
glance
that
alexia
took
of
their
faces
she
guessed
the
whole
thing
polly
she
gasped
seizing
polly
arm
you
do
mean
that
our
miss
mary
is
going
to
marry
mr
dyce
yes
i
do
said
polly
happily
mean
just
that
very
thing
alexia
i
do
believe
it
declared
alexia
while
all
the
time
she
knew
it
was
true
by
their
radiant
faces
well
it
is
true
as
true
can
be
said
polly
for
she
told
me
so
this
very
afternoon
at
her
house
and
you
known
it
all
this
time
cried
alexia
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
in
a
passion
at
polly
and
never
told
me
at
all
oh
alexia
how
could
i
cried
polly
in
an
aggrieved
little
voice
for
we
were
in
such
a
perfectly
dreadful
scrape
over
getting
ready
for
the
supper
how
could
i
alexia
she
turned
such
a
miserable
face
that
alexia
made
haste
to
say
you
could
you
sweet
thing
you
and
gave
her
a
reassuring
hug
well
just
look
at
dyce
and
hear
him
laugh
and
hamilton
dyce
being
unable
to
keep
his
delight
within
bounds
and
seeming
to
think
it
incumbent
upon
himself
to
take
the
young
people
into
his
confidence
just
coolly
announced
it
and
then
there
was
no
more
paying
attention
to
the
cakes
and
the
little
biscuits
the
custards
and
the
whipped
cream
and
even
alexia
nut
candy
went
begging
and
miss
mary
had
to
sit
in
the
center
of
each
group
of
boys
and
girls
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
for
the
supper
was
passed
around
on
trays
till
dyce
said
he
wished
he
had
told
the
news
until
the
feast
was
ended
and
after
that
when
they
all
finished
up
the
evening
festivities
with
a
dance
why
every
one
there
tried
to
get
her
for
first
partner
but
it
was
alexia
who
swept
them
all
one
side
she
my
teacher
she
declared
and
i
shall
have
her
first
well
so
she
is
our
teacher
cried
half
a
dozen
of
the
girls
at
once
as
they
crowded
up
well
she
my
very
dearest
friend
that
is
except
polly
pepper
said
alexia
positively
come
miss
mary
hanging
obstinately
to
her
hand
on
which
shone
a
new
ring
with
a
big
bright
gem
in
it
well
you
said
miss
salisbury
was
pickering
dodge
on
the
fringe
of
the
circle
of
girls
could
help
saying
oh
well
i
mean
miss
mary
is
my
very
dearest
friend
after
that
said
alexia
coolly
tossing
him
a
saucy
glance
as
she
bore
off
her
beloved
teacher
down
the
whole
length
of
keep
floor
xxviii
the
little
stone
cupboard
phronsie
ran
down
the
hall
oh
mamsie
she
cried
hurrying
into
fisher
room
grandpapa
says
she
is
coming
she
really
is
she
clasped
her
hands
and
stood
quite
still
in
front
of
her
mother
who
dear
asked
fisher
absently
she
was
standing
over
by
the
window
with
one
of
phronsie
pinafores
in
her
hand
and
wondering
if
any
more
were
needed
to
carry
her
through
the
summer
she
really
is
mamsie
said
phronsie
very
much
disappointed
that
her
mother
did
seem
to
notice
then
her
mouth
drooped
and
she
gave
a
long
sigh
fisher
tore
her
mind
off
from
the
pinafores
and
looked
down
quickly
well
i
declare
child
and
she
took
her
in
her
arms
now
then
she
put
the
pinafore
in
a
chair
and
herself
in
another
then
she
drew
phronsie
into
her
lap
tell
mother
all
about
it
she
said
yes
said
phronsie
i
will
snuggling
in
great
satisfaction
up
against
her
mother
neck
you
see
my
little
girl
is
really
coming
grandpapa
said
so
oh
yes
rachel
yes
phronsie
bobbed
her
yellow
head
then
took
it
up
from
its
in
her
mother
neck
to
peer
up
into
the
face
above
and
she
be
my
little
girl
all
the
time
she
is
here
and
i
must
get
clorinda
fixed
this
very
minute
she
added
dreadfully
excited
and
her
news
all
told
phronsie
clambered
down
from
fisher
lap
and
scurried
off
and
in
a
few
minutes
everybody
knew
all
over
the
house
that
the
letter
had
come
in
which
the
invitation
for
rachel
visit
had
been
accepted
by
miss
parrott
moreover
she
was
to
arrive
on
the
following
day
sang
joel
who
very
much
liked
rachel
for
she
was
always
ready
to
play
anything
that
he
proposed
and
was
a
perfect
adept
in
climbing
trees
and
inventing
a
circus
out
of
small
material
now
just
prime
i
wish
she
was
coming
van
and
percy
just
as
well
pleased
ran
hither
and
yon
very
much
excited
what
shall
we
do
to
show
her
we
are
glad
she
coming
asked
percy
who
seized
every
chance
that
offered
itself
to
celebrate
such
events
why
she
see
it
said
joel
pounding
away
lustily
he
was
mending
his
tennis
racket
whickets
i
split
that
holding
it
up
ruefully
fisher
told
you
not
to
say
that
cried
van
who
dearly
loved
to
bring
joel
up
for
correction
well
i
did
mean
joel
whirled
around
on
him
and
i
guess
you
say
it
if
you
split
your
racket
so
she
told
you
not
to
repeated
van
knowing
his
power
in
holding
to
that
simple
statement
well
i
did
mean
to
i
tell
you
cried
joel
loudly
and
very
red
in
the
face
and
she
wo
like
it
said
van
delighted
to
see
the
effect
of
his
words
joel
face
worked
and
he
flung
the
broken
racket
across
the
room
it
fell
with
a
crash
and
he
ran
over
to
the
bed
hopped
into
the
middle
of
it
and
buried
his
face
in
his
brown
hands
his
shoulders
in
distress
i
did
mean
go
away
he
screamed
kicking
as
hard
as
he
could
van
terribly
frightened
at
the
storm
he
had
raised
stood
perfectly
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
there
now
i
hope
you
satisfied
said
percy
from
the
other
side
see
what
you
done
i
guess
you
catch
it
van
whitney
he
added
pleasantly
van
not
so
much
worried
over
what
he
would
catch
as
terrified
about
joel
ran
over
to
his
brother
oh
do
stop
him
he
implored
seizing
percy
hand
i
ca
stop
him
said
percy
you
know
yourself
it
silly
to
ask
me
that
i
must
then
cried
van
scurrying
over
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
joel
do
stop
he
begged
frantically
go
away
screamed
joel
kicking
lustily
i
did
mean
to
say
it
oh
dear
me
mamsie
mamsie
he
blubbered
rolling
from
side
to
side
on
the
neat
white
bed
i
guess
he
going
to
have
a
fit
said
percy
cheerfully
coming
up
to
view
matters
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
flying
feet
at
this
van
distress
knew
no
bounds
and
regardless
of
all
possible
danger
to
himself
he
ran
around
the
bed
and
flung
himself
upon
it
to
burrow
close
to
joel
stubby
black
head
joe
do
he
cried
bursting
into
tears
and
hugging
him
with
both
frantic
arms
joel
wriggled
and
screamed
go
away
and
kicked
more
than
ever
but
van
held
on
sturdily
and
together
the
two
boys
rolled
over
and
over
across
the
bed
back
and
forth
till
their
breath
gave
out
oh
just
look
what
you
are
doing
exclaimed
percy
prancing
up
and
down
the
room
he
had
started
two
or
three
times
to
run
out
and
call
fisher
then
thought
better
of
it
you
mussed
the
bedspread
all
up
and
only
look
at
those
shams
hanging
over
the
footboard
in
extreme
dismay
hearing
these
last
words
both
boys
rolled
apart
and
thrust
up
their
heads
to
gaze
at
the
details
in
question
there
they
were
spick
and
span
as
usual
at
the
top
but
the
lower
parts
were
all
mussed
and
wrinkled
while
the
lace
at
one
end
hung
down
in
a
small
tag
oh
dear
me
cried
joel
huddling
up
to
van
to
throw
his
arm
around
his
neck
just
see
what
i
done
oh
you
did
do
it
i
did
said
van
giving
joel
an
affectionate
squeeze
it
was
all
my
fault
no
such
thing
declared
joel
sturdily
if
you
say
so
again
i
fight
you
and
perhaps
you
can
straighten
that
lace
suggested
percy
with
no
relish
for
any
further
hostilities
van
and
joel
drew
off
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
huddled
up
there
to
regard
his
efforts
as
he
ran
around
to
the
pillows
patting
and
smoothing
them
straight
that
wo
do
any
good
said
joel
in
great
disfavor
you
ca
make
the
lace
whole
again
van
sorrowfully
embraced
his
knees
his
feet
tucked
up
under
him
oh
what
will
jane
say
he
breathed
fearfully
jane
i
do
care
for
her
said
joel
scornfully
it
mamsie
and
he
swallowed
hard
perhaps
she
wo
care
cried
van
leaving
his
knees
to
take
care
of
themselves
in
alarm
lest
joel
was
going
off
again
and
just
see
how
you
mussed
up
the
bedspread
percy
could
help
saying
to
relieve
his
chagrin
over
the
failure
to
make
the
pillow
shams
look
nicely
and
he
drew
off
and
pointed
to
it
tragically
it
looks
as
if
crocodiles
had
been
all
over
it
he
declared
hunting
for
the
worst
thing
he
could
think
of
joel
and
van
rolled
fearful
eyes
all
over
the
bed
i
going
to
mamsie
was
all
joel
said
as
he
rolled
over
the
edge
and
disappeared
from
the
room
oh
wait
screamed
van
then
he
rolled
off
his
side
of
the
bed
took
two
big
steps
and
stood
quite
still
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
you
got
to
go
with
him
and
help
tell
said
percy
pleasantly
as
if
proposing
the
most
delightful
thing
but
van
did
stir
are
you
ashamed
cried
percy
with
a
sniff
i
like
to
know
if
polly
will
think
it
nice
for
you
to
sneak
out
of
it
van
whitney
ow
squealed
van
he
shot
out
into
the
hall
and
without
giving
himself
time
to
think
ran
as
hard
as
he
could
to
join
joel
in
mother
room
left
to
himself
percy
set
himself
to
work
on
straightening
the
bedspread
running
around
from
one
side
to
the
other
to
pat
and
twitch
impatiently
as
soon
as
i
get
one
side
nice
it
all
comes
away
from
the
other
he
said
to
himself
how
in
the
world
does
jane
ever
make
a
bed
i
wonder
and
at
last
he
deserted
it
altogether
and
drew
off
with
a
very
hot
face
i
wish
we
could
do
something
to
celebrate
when
rachel
comes
and
he
wrinkled
his
brows
in
perplexity
oh
i
know
and
he
clapped
his
hands
in
glee
then
he
ran
softly
out
and
up
to
ben
room
but
ben
was
in
so
percy
nearly
bursting
with
a
plan
that
now
seemed
to
him
very
grand
was
obliged
to
take
some
one
else
into
his
confidence
and
that
one
happened
to
be
old
king
whom
he
met
as
he
came
downstairs
with
a
very
rueful
countenance
what
the
matter
percy
asked
the
old
gentleman
with
a
keen
glance
nothing
grandpapa
said
percy
dismally
goodness
me
do
you
carry
about
such
a
face
as
that
for
nothing
cried
the
old
gentleman
with
a
laugh
you
look
as
if
you
something
on
your
mind
my
boy
well
i
have
grandpapa
said
percy
now
driven
into
a
corner
and
looking
up
at
last
best
have
it
out
then
said
grandpapa
firmly
taking
one
of
hands
and
they
went
on
to
the
there
now
here
is
just
the
place
for
a
boy
to
get
things
that
are
unpleasant
off
his
mind
i
take
it
he
said
closing
the
door
on
them
both
sit
down
and
tell
me
what
is
troubling
you
percy
ca
i
stand
up
grandpapa
asked
percy
over
by
the
table
to
be
sure
laughed
grandpapa
stand
up
or
sit
down
just
as
you
choose
only
let
us
get
at
this
bugaboo
that
is
worrying
you
my
boy
out
with
it
it
is
a
bugaboo
said
percy
with
open
eyes
it
a
plan
grandpapa
only
i
ca
find
ben
and
he
began
to
be
dismal
once
more
dear
me
where
can
he
be
oh
it
a
plan
is
it
said
grandpapa
vastly
relieved
well
well
then
he
began
to
laugh
and
so
you
wanted
ben
to
help
you
with
it
eh
yes
grandpapa
said
percy
his
happiness
returning
and
he
deserted
the
table
and
ran
up
to
the
old
gentleman
side
you
see
rachel
is
coming
yes
she
is
said
old
king
with
a
satisfied
nod
and
you
like
it
i
hope
my
boy
he
looked
up
with
a
keen
glance
awfully
said
percy
great
satisfaction
settling
over
his
face
well
i
think
all
of
us
like
the
plan
remarked
the
old
gentleman
in
extreme
complacency
at
achieving
the
visit
for
she
a
very
nice
girl
rachel
is
it
appears
to
me
she
awfully
good
fun
said
percy
only
joel
will
make
her
play
with
him
all
the
time
i
suppose
and
his
face
fell
oh
you
must
cut
joe
out
said
old
king
laughing
heartily
i
ca
said
percy
dismally
we
ca
any
of
us
grandpapa
and
he
opened
his
blue
eyes
very
wide
at
the
mere
thought
well
yes
i
think
we
are
all
pleased
very
much
pleased
indeed
that
rachel
is
coming
repeated
old
king
going
back
to
the
expected
visit
and
as
she
comes
echoed
percy
aghast
why
then
i
ca
get
up
my
surprise
grandpapa
for
strange
to
say
the
time
of
the
arrival
had
slipped
from
his
mind
the
old
gentleman
hastened
to
comfort
him
suppose
you
tell
me
the
grand
plan
he
said
at
last
then
we
see
if
there
wo
be
time
enough
oh
i
was
going
to
get
ben
to
take
me
out
into
the
woods
said
percy
feeling
as
if
he
should
very
much
like
to
cry
he
was
so
disappointed
and
we
could
have
dug
up
some
cunning
little
plants
and
ferns
rachel
said
she
liked
them
at
the
garden
party
we
could
have
planted
them
in
a
box
and
have
been
so
nice
and
now
it
too
late
and
overcome
with
despair
he
sat
down
on
the
first
thing
he
could
find
which
was
a
pile
of
books
on
the
floor
take
care
warned
grandpapa
but
over
percy
had
gone
the
books
flying
all
ways
under
him
i
pick
them
up
he
cried
when
he
could
get
his
breath
i
am
glad
you
are
not
hurt
said
grandpapa
king
with
a
rueful
glance
at
the
big
reference
volumes
only
laid
out
for
his
use
that
morning
which
certainly
would
be
improved
by
their
fall
here
wait
a
bit
and
help
you
percy
my
boy
and
he
got
out
of
his
chair
oh
i
can
do
it
let
me
grandpapa
let
me
do
it
alone
begged
percy
tugging
at
the
books
and
piling
as
rapidly
as
he
could
for
they
were
quite
heavy
there

they
almost
back
again
as

at
the
prospect
of

he
crowded
in
between
the
old
gentleman
chair
and
the
big
table
and
regarded
him
anxiously
no

cried
old
king
in
his
most
emphatic
way
and
bringing
his
hand
heavily
down
on
the
table

your
and
my
secret
percy
my
boy
and
outside
in
a
slope
of
the
terrace
where
it
ran
down
to
a
tangle
of
greenery
were
phronsie
and
little
dick
and
they
were
making
great
preparations
too
for
rachel
visit
on
the
following
day
the
great
task
before
them
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
to

their
little
stone
house
in

boulders
under

big
apple
tree
i

array
on

big
flat
stone
that
served
them
as
a
table
well

said
dick
his
fingers
twitching
to
be
at
their
work
for
it
just
full
of
everything
he
had
pulled
out
the
stone
from
a
hole
between
the
boulders
which
running
in
quite
deeply
had
served
as
a
convenient
receptacle
for
certain
treasures
and
accumulations
and
was
therefore
called
the
cupboard

have
cleaned
it
out
in

soft
little
bit
of
cloth
in

said
phronsie
gravely
handing
him
another
small
portion
of

because

and

put

hands
and
drew
them
up
i

phronsie
smoothing

her
pink

along
because

auntie
waiting
now
then
one
two
three
and
away
she
seized
a
small
hand
in
each
of
her
own
and
away
they
sped
none
too
soon
for
jasper
was
just
skipping
down
to
meet
them
with
the
announcement
that
sister
marion
was
getting
into
the
carriage
and
there
on
the
steps
was
fisher
with
phronsie
hat
in
her
hand
get
in
young
man
said
jasper
cramming
dick
cap
on
his
head
and
he
bundled
him
in
unceremoniously
then
hopped
after
himself
i
going
to
buy
my
little
girl
something
announced
phronsie
looking
back
where
mamsie
still
stood
upon
the
step
yes
yes
she
said
smilingly
as
thomas
started
up
the
horses
wait
wait
cried
phronsie
in
a
tone
of
great
distress
and
she
leaned
out
toward
mamsie
what
is
it
child
said
fisher
and
wait
a
bit
thomas
called
jasper
what
the
matter
phronsie
asked
polly
leaning
over
from
the
opposite
seat
where
she
was
ensconced
with
whitney
i
want
my
little
purse
said
phronsie
looking
down
at
her
empty
hands
then
up
at
her
in
grave
reproach
oh
phronsie
you
can
take
some
of
my
money
began
polly
we
wait
for
that
need
we
mamsie
she
cried
wrinkling
up
her
forehead
impatiently
i
want
my
own
little
purse
said
phronsie
decidedly
yes
mamsie
will
get
it
said
fisher
that
is
if
whitney
can
wait
she
cast
a
glance
over
polly
into
the
pleasant
face
above
yes

said
whitney
with
a
cheery
smile
i
think
phronsie
had
much
better
have
her
own
little
purse
and
i
want
my
own
purse
too
declared
little
dick
struggling
to
get
down
from
the
seat
where
he
was
wedged
in
with
jasper
and
phronsie
mine
is
big
like
a
man
he
added
with
great
importance
dear
me
whitney
burst
into
a
merry
laugh
fisher
do
you
think
you
could
be
troubled
enough
to
get
dicky
boy
purse
too
she
asked
i
do
find
it
any
trouble
said
fisher
with
another
laugh
to
get
them
both
so
phronsie
little
purse
with
a
chain
to
hang
on
her
arm
and
dick
bigger
one
that
folded
like
a
pocketbook
were
both
handed
into
the
carriage
thomas
cracked
the
whip
and
off
they
went
to
see
candace
in
her
little
shop
on
temple
place
the
next
day
but
one
rachel
was
visiting
in
the
little
stone
house
among
the
boulders
phronsie
had
carefully
explained
how
the
reason
that
the
cups
and
saucers
were
all
on
the
ground
and
the
thrown
carelessly
aside
was
that
they
had
gone
away
with
auntie
who
could
be
kept
waiting
well
let
wash
up
now
said
rachel
flying
for
one
of
the
diminutive
i
going
to
clean
out
the
cupboard
declared
little
dick
going
back
to
his
original
purpose
let
us
do
the
cups
and
saucers
first
said
phronsie
with
gentle
determination
setting
down
clorinda
on
a
stone
seat
next
to
rachel
doll
and
carefully
smoothing
out
her
dress
no
i
want
to
do
the
cupboard
persisted
little
dick
with
strange
obstinacy
for
he
was
generally
quite
willing
to
give
up
to
phronsie
i
tell
you
phronsie
broke
in
rachel
suddenly
let
all
set
up
the
cupboard
first
and
then
it
will
be
ready
to
put
the
clean
dishes
into
that
the
best
way
oh
let
us
said
phronsie
easily
pleased
and
giving
a
last
pat
to
rachel
doll
so
she
ran
over
to
join
the
others
and
getting
down
on
her
knees
she
began
to
fumble
within
the
little
cupboard
dick
had
already
opened
the
door
which
was
accomplished
by
taking
away
the
stone
now
you
take
out
one
thing
phronsie
and
i
take
out
the
next
said
little
dick
crowding
up
as
close
as
he
could
get
and
then
i
take
the
things
said
rachel
sitting
down
a
little
distance
off
between
the
two
as
you
hand
out
so
we
all
clean
out
the
cupboard
hullo
what
this
as
phronsie
handed
out
the
first
article
that
a
top
said
little
dick
looking
back
at
her
a
top
cried
rachel
in
derision
why
it
wo
spin
not
a
bit
in
this
world
it
would
before
it
was
broken
said
phronsie
for
dick
had
his
face
pressed
close
to
the
door
of
the
cupboard
while
his
brown
fingers
were
prowling
about
its
interior
dear
me
why
do
you
throw
it
away
cried
rachel
an
old
broken
thing
like
that
is
no
good
oh
we
would
ever
throw
it
away
rachel
said
phronsie
in
alarm
that
our
dear
top
and
it
used
to
spin
beautifully
and
she
took
it
affectionately
out
of
rachel
hand
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
rachel
well
what
the
next
thing
as
little
dick
backed
away
from
the
cupboard
what
is
it
as
he
placed
some
article
in
her
hand
they
a
pair
of
her
doll
eyes
said
little
dick
oh
misery
me
cried
rachel
tumbling
backward
the
pair
of
eyes
in
her
hand
why
do
you
have
put
back
in
your
doll
phronsie
because
these
are
broken
said
phronsie
hanging
on
to
the
top
with
one
hand
while
she
reached
out
the
other
and
grandpapa
took
my
child
down
and
got
her
new
eyes
well
what
makes
you
save
these
said
rachel
sitting
straight
again
they
no
use
phronsie
now
they
broken
throw
them
away
do
no
no
protested
phronsie
holding
the
pair
of
eyes
very
closely
in
her
warm
little
palm
they
were
my
child
i
going
to
keep
them
always
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
rachel
faintly
you
never
set
up
your
cupboard
if
you
going
to
put
everything
back
again
the
same
as
it
was
well
pull
out
the
next
thing
phronsie
it
your
turn
so
phronsie
set
her
two
treasures
down
in
a
niche
in
the
big
boulder
and
leaned
over
the
door
of
the
cupboard
i
going
clear
back
she
announced
running
her
fat
little
arm
as
far
as
it
would
go
to
bring
it
out
with
something
round
in
the
middle
of
her
palm
what
is
it
asked
rachel
curiously
whatever
in
all
this
world
phronsie
at
the
queer
little
wad
in
phronsie
hand
oh
that
said
little
dick
before
phronsie
could
answer
that
what
the
squirrel
gave
us
a
lo
ong
time
ago
rachel
the
squirrel
gave
you
she
cried
i
suppose
it
a
nut
she
added
carelessly
no
is
a
nut
said
phronsie
still
keeping
it
in
her
hand
and
shaking
her
head
decidedly
and
he
was
a
naughty
squirrel
he
was
in
a
bird
nest
in
a
bird
nest
what
do
you
mean
and
how
could
you
see
him
demanded
rachel
all
three
questions
in
one
breath
we
looked
up
said
little
dick
throwing
his
head
back
to
illustrate
his
speech
and
he
was
right
there
pointing
up
to
the
highest
branches
of
the
apple
tree
way
up
on
top
and
the
poor
bird
was
screaming
said
phronsie
snuggling
up
to
side
but
still
not
offering
to
give
up
the
little
green
wad
poor
little
bird
she
made
a
new
house
she
added
sorrowfully
and
the
naughty
squirrel
was
pulling
out
all
the
things
in
her
house
said
little
dick
breaking
in
with
gusto
and
flinging
them
down
and
he
threw
us
this
show
her
phronsie
so
phronsie
opened
her
hand
and
held
it
up
the
little
green
wad
in
the
center
oh
is
it
funny
rachel
was
going
to
say
instead
she
seized
it
twitched
it
apart
and
hopped
up
to
her
feet
then
deserting
the
two
children
ran
like
lightning
up
the
green
bank
two
torn
bits
of
paper
fluttering
in
her
hand
and
not
observing
where
she
went
she
ran
directly
into
old
king
taking
a
constitutional
on
the
lawn
bless
me
what
is
it
he
gasped
putting
out
a
strong
hand
to
save
her
from
a
fall
it
the
bill
panted
rachel
do
you
see
waving
it
at
him
the
end
